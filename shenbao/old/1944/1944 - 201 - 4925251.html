<h3>喚起科學意識—從「着鏢」說起—</h3>
<p>— 蔣遇圭</p>
<p>近來走在路上，時見幼童將手內一小一小木棒向對方擲去，口內連喊。。「着鏢着鏢。」此與舞靑龍偃月刀與梨花槍，異曲同工，「鏢」乃黃天霸，實二墩之殺手鐧，靑龍偃月刀與梨花槍則為關雲長與薜丁山之武器，然而即使今日之學童將來均成為黃天霸與薛丁山者流，中國是否測好起來呢？</p>
<p>外國之學童則在街上拋飛樣模型，在家玩弄小火車與機關槍，無時無地不在啟發其科軍的素養，與發明的智能，所以諸外國終究成為近代國家。</p>
<p>中國的中學生多半是看看言情小說。在報紙上做做小品文，或是努力奔走辦個小型的文藝刊物，對於理科一向是畏如狼虎，外國的中學生，則看科學畫報，有的在上面發表他舞那很簡單的發明，有些照着上面的做法，來習做飛機戰艦的模型，其結果中國的靑年思想，是個人享樂了，是風花雪月了，是對國家民族，抱着一種「漠不相關」的態度了，而外國的靑年的思想是急進的，是實際的，是脚踏實地的。</p>
<p>中國的大學生，是學法律的，因為法律時髦，而且　着化中國為法治國家的使命，中國的大學生是學商學的，因為銀行界當貴而舒適，中國大學生是學文學的，一部分研究古書希圖保存或發揚國粹，一部分研究西洋文學，來改進中國的腐化，其他一部分則研究政經了，畢業後有了路了，立刻可做大官。</p>
<p>外國有農菜大學，工業大學，拓殖大學，水產學校，礦山學校，那一羣大學生是工人似的，他們腦裹沒有律師，銀行家，政治家的頭銜，只曉得努力學習技術，希望將來能成一個技術家。</p>
<p>然而外國是科學國家了，中國的農村永是封閉於封建思想裹，生產手段不知改良，大都市周邊的僅有的少數輕工業工塲，採用少量的機械，　機械是從外國買來的，最後中國的產品不如外國，中國做了經濟市塲。</p>
<p>但話又說回來，為什麼學童，中學生，大學生，都對科學不感覺興趣呢？其原因是中國的家長，敎育家不努力提倡科學；或者為了經濟的限制，但家長為什麼不把買靑龍偃月刀的錢，給孩童買火車玩具？敎育家為什麼不把創設大學，中學的錢，來開設一個簡陋的工業學校？</p>
<p>其根本原因，遝是中國人沒有科學的認識，所以才不肯對第二代施以科學的敎育，同時對科學抱種畏難心，就馬馬忽忽不去問津了。</p>
<p>但我們仔細沉思一下，或是翻閱歷史，看看其他各國發達的徑路，除了科學手段以外，還有其他發展為近代國家的路子嗎？恐怕沒有，各近代國家都是經過了科學的階段，那麼我們的國除非不想成為近代國家了，否則和科學的接近是不可避免的一件事，旣不可避免，大家怎能抱着馬馬忽忽的態度，不去問津呢？</p>
<p>世界各國的進化，若用科學來分，我們可以把它分成三個階段，第一是無科學時代，第二是發明科學時代，第三是應用科學時代，第一時代是神權政會對建社會，人們在一種精神的約束之下活着！第二時代是近代國家的啟蒙時期，正是牛頓，甯蘭克林，瓦特，達爾文……等科學家發明科學應用的時候，第三時代是應用科學了，除物質生活外，科學的應用有時達到精神生活的領城，現在世界各進步的國家，都到了第三時代。</p>
<p>我們柬洋人占了一種便宜的，那魷是我以超越第二時代，而由第一時代飛躍時代，日本自明治維新後，就努力採的精華，結果安穩地超越第二時代而成時代的國家了。</p>
<p>中國只要努力，當然也可超過第三時代，而這超越的工具是什麼呢，就是「科學」</p>
<p>現在中國還在第一時代裹混着，因為大家還對科學沒有認識，然而第一時代裏的國家，一切法律家等的理想，什麼化中國為法治，正和幼童練飛劍。發掌心雷的理想一樣，是不可能實現的「烏托邦」，只有經過科學階段，中國成為第三時代的國家後，才能實現其他的理想，所以無論從任何觀點說，認識科學實在是第一義。</p>
<p>現在時機是刻不容緩了，大家急需要瘋狂般的和科學接近，在可能範圍內從事畢習，打破已往的畏縮，取消忽視的心裹。</p>
<p>中國在某一時期內，不打出第一時代的圈子，不利用科學來實現第三時代的國家，中國的民族將毀滅，或是懷着烏托邦思想，成為世界上的第二「吉布賽」！</p>
<p>現在中國國內的一部分人，已經成為流浪的吉布賽了，安靜的家鄉為了政治，經濟關係不能住下去，到外鄉去飄泊，外鄉沒有供給勝食的家，沒有財產，沒有職業，在街頭一天天地流浪着，豈不成了吉布賽嗎？</p>
<p>然而中國人永遠馬馬忽忽，不關心大局，卽使有一部分人腰囊已足，而亦只能快樂一短短時光，不久即會同大多數人，或全民族，成為吉布賽的！</p>
<p>現在惟一的指標，是大家從現在起始，認識一下「科學」吧！</p>

<h3>日强力內閣成立國府特發表聲明　本同盟道義精神共同邁進</h3>
<p>南京二十二日中央社電　日東條內閣為應付非常，一新人心，乃於本月十八日實行總辭職。由小磯·米內·兩大將組織內閣，已於二十日組悶竣事，閣員名單亦巳發表。國民政府特發表聲明，表明國府決本過去同盟道義精神，集中人力物力，共同向擊滅英美之途邁進。茲誌國府聲明如下。「此次東條內閣為對處重大戰局，一新人心，於本月十八日實行總辭職。繼任內閣已正式發表小磯國昭大將，米內光政大將二氏，共同組織強力內閣。</p>

<p>褚外長談話</p>
<p>南京二十二日中央社電　日新內閣已於二十二日組成，我外交部褚部長，特發表談話如下：東局勢最緊張之時。不久本人返國，東條大將　旋即於十二月八日拜受宣戰大詔，對英美宣戰，一舉將英美在東亞之侵略據點覆滅，一面與我國簽訂中日同盟條約，復於東京舉行大東亞會議，發表共同宣言。對內根據總力戰立場，完成舉國一致之戰時體制。對外團結大東亞各民族，確立共榮圈之基礎，其豐功偉續，早為世人共曉。此次為對處目前重大戰局，毅然引退讓賢，改為小磯·米內·兩大將出任艱鉅，組成有力戰時體制之內閣，以完遂大東亞戰爭最後之勝利。終以小磯大將任總理，米內大將任海相，杉山元帥任陸相，使海陸更越於一致，以應付非常。外務大臣仍為任我國經濟最高顧問，均為國人素所欽佩。預料中日邦交前途，必能仍本過去之情神，愈益緊密提携，為大東亞放一異彩也。</p>
<p>南京二十二日中央社電　日新閣組成，鮑總參謀畏發表談話如下：回溯東條內閣發動大東亞戰爭以來，一舉覆滅英美在東亞侵略勢力，奠定必勝基礎，實為歴史上光輝之偉續。今者小磯大將任總理大臣，輔以陸相杉山元帥，海相米內大將，益知陸海軍緊密合作，對戰爭前途，必有驚人發展。深盼國人本主席昭示，努力於增產，協力完遂戰爭勝利，并盼渝方及早覺悟，勿倍英美宣傳，促進全面和平，實現共同擔當重大使命。</p>
<p>向新閣致警</p>
<p>南京二十二日中央社電　外交部長褚民誼，於日閣組成後，電蔡大使囑向日新閣致敬並達賀忱，原電如下：「東京祭大使孑平兄鑒，此次日閣改組，强力益臻，應付非常，至堪欣慰。自小磯總理以下，多係舊好，望魷近代為致敬，並達賀忱，不另分電，褚民誼」。</p>
<p>我朝野欣奮</p>
<p>南京二十二日中央社電　盟邦新閣員名單發表後，我國朝野各界無不決表欣奮。蓋對於日新內悶之將更見強力一點，已完全符合我人最初之預料，此不僅因新首相小磯大將個人具有熟練之政治手腦，及積極進取之性格，即各部大臣，如內相人達茂雄等，無不為日本衆望所歸之第一流人材，而蜚聲國內外。吾人由此次之新閣人選，可特別提倡者，有兩點：其一即為日本之外交政策，將</p>
<p>毫無變更</p>
<p>之重光氏之蟬聯外相，即可證明，而無待贅言。因此重光氏之兼任大東亞相，以渠豐富之外交經騐，用之於團結東亞上，可謂異常適切。尤其重光氏與我國具有深切之淵源，故不僅由此可知日本之對華國策將絲毫不變，且就新內閣之整個性格而觀，可推知其將更加強實。至於連任藏相之石渡莊太郞氏，為日本之理財能手，不久以前猶任我國府最高經濟顧問，今後與吾國在財政上提携協力，更加緊密，自在意中，此亦可以附帶偍倡者。其第一點，即為此次日內閣之性格，益見淸新，故其在指導決戰上之政治力，自必將。</p>
<p>更為堅强</p>
<p>此觀新閣中各開僚個人之經歷，即可證明。如文部大臣二宮重治，厚生大臣廣瀨久忠，前者為軍人而具有周密之參謀人才，後者為確音本區生制度之功臣。至於司法大臣松阪廣政，歷任司法界各職，近五年來，先任東京控訴院，相當於吾國之高等法院檢事長，繼升撿事總長，素為法界名宿。其尤堪注目者，即為大達內相，蓋渠之個性旣極強，手腕又爽利。過去在福并縣知事任內，即因與山崎達雄內相等意見牴觸，而辭職。平素嫌於政黨，不肯遷就。常大東亞戰爭初期，昭南設特別市，氏即以</p>
<p>苦幹著名</p>
<p>而被任為第一任市長，於烽火之中，致力全市復興建設，以粗綫條之作風，於一年餘內，即使昭南得復戰前情况。去歲東京改設都制時，氏又被日政府邀為負實籌備人，迨都制告成，即任第一任長官。綜其一生經歷，頗具創造性。此次出任戰時下之內相，其將發揮強力手腕，推進國內戰時體制，不難預料。又島田農相，氣魄毅力，均有過人之處，尤長於辭才，故前首相田中義一常譽之為「馳聘於千軍萬馬中之政治家」，其能力之強，不難想見。至藤原軍需相，為實業巨子，過去即曾任商工大臣，在大東亞戰爭下，從事</p>
<p>軍需生產</p>
<p>不遺餘力。故於東條內閣中即被任為國務大臣，擔當參劃軍需增產工作，卓著功勳，前田運通相公昔政友會中即有長老之目，平素沉默寡言，嘗謂「處世要訣在不發無意義之談話」，其只做不說之精神，堪為日本民族性之代表。町田國務相以思慮局密著名。兒玉國務相會歷任拓相遞相內相各職，緒方國務相現任日本三大將之一之朝日新聞主筆，為日本新聞界之</p>
<p>有力份子</p>
<p>以上各人，無不深具堅毅積極之性格，更以其不畏艱鉅之熱誠，在小磯首相下，担當決戰政治之各部門，其力量與陣容之堅強，可謂前所未有，更益以陸軍元老杉山元帥之長睦軍，米內大將之長海軍，在處理決戰軍事之行政上，有此兩大柱石，實足以應付任何艱局。綜上而觀，可知新內閣之閣僚有元老，有小壯，有政黨出身者，有民間言論家，有產業巨子，有參謀　秀，可謂已網羅</p>
<p>朝野傑才</p>
<p>各界俊彥，而完成大團結之形勢。故其力量之强，及能獲得日本國內外之信賴者，蓋可斷言，從而預料大東亞戰爭之新局面，即將因此次强力內閣之出現而展開，吾人於此亦絕對可以信賴今後當以更堅強之決心，與盟邦協力爭取勝利。</p>
<h3>汪主席電祝日小磯首相　同時並電東條前首相</h3>
<p>南京二十二日中央社電　此次日小磯，米內兩大將拜受大命組組新閣，刻已告組成，由小磯大將任內閣總理，注主席特電小磯總理大臣致祝，原文如下：東京蔡大使轉日本小磯內閣總理大臣閣下，當茲大東亞戰爭已臨決勝階段，閣下　受大命，擔當非常，必能把握時機，強力進仃同定之國業，以蘄致永久之光榮，並祝關下政躬康泰，中華民國國民政府主席汪兆銘。</p>
<p>南京二十日中央社　日東條內閣總辭職後，汪主席特電東條前內閣總理，原電云：東京蔡大使轉日本東條前內閣總理大臣閣下，當茲大東亞戰爭之臨決勝階段，貴閣一致辭職，應付非常，至可惋惜。溯自閣下拜承大命，果敢堅決，排除萬雖，為解決當前局勢，肅淸太平洋英美勢力，根據國際道義，促成大東亞十億民族之團結，奠定東亞共榮圈之基礎，豐功偉續，彪炳寰宇，尙望協力不懈，完成大業，實所企盼，中華民國國民政府主席汪兆銘。</p>
<p>日調遣大軍進攻　衡陽戰事激烈</p>
<p>里斯本二十二日中央社電　據重慶電稱，渝軍當局廿一日發表衡陽戰况如次：日軍始終不放棄攻擊衡陽之決意，現正調這數師兵力，進攻該市。於過去雙方之激戰己歷二十五日之久。渝軍現增調一部兵力駛援衡陽，刻正由該巿西方及南方向前進攻，故該地區之戰事，極為激烈。又衡陽市街甫方之日軍，以渝軍救援部隊欲謀與市街地區受重壓之守備部隊會合，故刻正加以阻止。</p>
<p>里斯本二十一日中央社電　據處慶電：重慶政權發言人張平羣，十九日發表談話，其大意謂日軍於湖南戰綫，逐次以大批部隊與重砲增援，故衡陽之戰鬥，已達於最高潮，渝軍實不敢預告是役之結果。</p>
<p>俞督戰隊迫驅作戰</p>
<p>湖南前綫二十二日中央社電衡陽城內渝二萬守備軍，因遭日軍二重包圍，己完全孤立，刻渝軍之抗戰　雖總微弱，然渝第一綫之反抗頗極強硬。後經判明此乃由於渝方派出奮戰隊所致，凡自前綫後退者，當即自其背後射殺之。爰日軍某日，為乘暗夜一舉突入衡陽城渝軍陣地，靜待時機到來。然是夜九時許，突見渝軍活動，約渝軍一大隊，狂喊殺字，逆襲前來，於是日軍當將之誘至陣地前方，突由左右中三方面，開始猛射，將其大部殲滅，更追擊向城內敗走之渝軍。此時前方渝軍復悲壯怒號，再度來襲，此實由於機槍之督戰隊，迫驅彼等向前攻擊故也。又據在某地拾得之英文作戰命令中得悉，美人將校已在渝軍中擔任指揮，美軍為謀其本身安全，驅使渝軍與日軍交戰，此種殘酷行為，於緬甸印度及南方前綫，已屢見不鮮，美軍企圖再以渝軍為犧牲，踏毀中中國大陸，自無贅言之必要云。</p>
<h3>大宮島西岸激戰日軍奮勇迎擊中　兩區登陸敵死傷四千餘</h3>
<p>東京二十二日中央社電　日大本營七月二十二日下午四時發表：七月二十一日長，敵約二個師團在大宮島西岸明石灣及昭和灣兩地區開始登陸，當地日軍部隊刻正迎擊奮戰中。</p>
<p>中部太平洋某基地二十二日中央社電　敵軍約一師，更配有戰車百五十輛，自二十一日上午七時半開始在大宮島西北岸阿桑（阿叔市西方）登陸，更於八時以運輸船三十艘載約半帥團之兵力，在該島西岸阿加特灣登陸，該烏日軍守備隊，當行邀擊，刻仍激戰中。迄今判明者，阿桑方面，敵軍傷亡者約三千二百名，阿加特灣死約一千一百名，總計四千三百名。</p>
<h3>鄭州漸復舊觀</h3>
<p>北平二十二日中央社電　日軍佔領鄧州後，民衆絡繹歸來，鄭市亦漸復舊觀。開封至鄭州之公路，及黃河南岸堤工，刻已竣工。此於豫省政治經濟建設上，裨益至大。</p>
<h3>立法院會議</h3>
<p>南京二十二日中央社電　立法院二十二日舉行一〇三次會議，主席陳院長，報告事項（略）。討論事項，木院財政法制兩委會，會同呈報審查修正契稅條例第四條條文案，議決，照審查案通過。</p>
<h3>自由印度政府成立紀念</h3>
<p>緬甸前綫日軍某基地二十二日中央社電　自由印度臨時政府成立紀念（廿一）日，緬甸某地盛大舉行民衆大會，鮑斯主席絕讚東亞印僑協力獨立運動，但為加强總動員運動，深望三百萬印僑及時奮起，以求實現獨立云云</p>
<h3>敵人毒計被粉碎德政局益趨穩固　前綫將領宣言對元首効忠</h3>
<p>柏林二十二日中央社電　海通社採訪主任許樂德評述陰謀危害希特勒元首之暴行與結果稱：德將及上校數人陰謀危害元首攫取政權，即被　肅淸，數小時後各處報告到來，昭示國社政制非常穩固，任何政變之企圖必歸失敗。昨夜柏林之中心，採取預防措施，為時甚新，且未發一彈，未設鉛絲網，足徵應會裕如，一切安靖矣。負責方面尙未秀露陰謀叛變者之姓名，一俟警察勘查後，德官方將發表詳明之文告。就已公布之文告觀察，企圖實行陰談者為史都芬堡上校，陰謀者故意造遙，謂元首逝世，並頒佈偽令，但令發而不行，迄無反響。貝克將軍（業已退伍）亦為參與叛變之一人，貝氏於一九三八年被免除陸軍參謀長之職，渠現已喪命。總之此次陰謀失敗之結果有三　陰謀叛國之小團處現已肅淸。　元首任命希姆萊將軍為國內防軍總司令，古特利安將軍為總參謀長。　全國人民，無一團體贊助陰謀政變者。由此可覘國社主義之穗國至為穩定，決無其他政制可適合德人之需求，敵人希冀傾覆穗國之毒計，於一小時內即被粉碎。</p>
<p>柏林二十二日中央社電　海通社訊：西歐德軍總司令克魯格元帥，向部下發表宣言，表示繼續効忠希特勒元首，其文曰，西綫之士兵乎，少數革職之軍官意圖殺書元首，然元首卒無恙。昨夜渠且曾向國民及兵士廣播，今罪犯均已消滅，國內秩序頗為良好，前後方之作戰仍繼續進行。吾儕軍人聞悉此訊後，莫不異常憤慨，吾儕決不容再有一九一八年式類似養大利政變之事發生，我西綫之士兵僅知以不可動搖之決心及忠誠，繼續與敵作戰，願希特勒元首萬歲，德意志萬歲。又昨日西綫戰事仍照常進行，總司令部情形依舊，前綫之代表部隊昨日舉行遊行，以示効忠元首</p>
<p>柏林二十二日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：東南歐德軍總司令韋傑上將，頃電德元首希特勒，對加害元首未遂，表示欣慰，并代表駐巴爾幹之一切德軍表示絕對效忠之意向。德第二機械化軍團總司令亦電元首効忠，駐挪威穗軍總司令亦因此事向部下發表文告。</p>
<p>叛變陰謀曇花一現</p>
<p>柏林二十二日中央社電海通社訊，此間負責方面稱：德元首遇刺未中後，希物勒元首·戈林元帥·宣傳部長郭培爾傳士·德軍總司令季台爾。海軍總司令竇尼資等要人互通電話，始終能控制局勢。同時德國要人與德國他部獲得聯絡。透露此次陰謀之詳情。安置定時炸彈之主犯為史都芬堡上校，今年三十七歲，係受少數具有野心之叛黨利用，供其奔走，自出事後數小時內所發現之文件中，證明叛黨與反軸心國之一，有密切之聯絡。主犯執行槍決前，此事經對有關人犯予以詳細之偵查後，獲有眞實之說據。叛黨係由少數退伍將官與後備軍中若干重要軍官組織之，此類將官業已退休，故與軍隊毫無關係。渠等在前綫與國內均無聲望，故叛黨所發之侖令，未得前綫與國內之遵從。蓋叛黨會於出事後，利用某下級軍官所管理之交通工具，向前綫與國內之軍隊頒布命令，幸接到命令者皆能立即察覺此乃叛黨所為，未予遵照辦理。柏林消息靈通方面稱，叛黨曾霸持某交通工具，使德元首不得不於黑夜發表演說，當德元首·戈林元帥·與　尼資海軍上將發表演說時，尙未知叛黨能利用其交通工具之久暫與範圍，後經局勢之發展，證明此項言論具有預防之作用，以免叛黨之侖令有所憑籍。</p>
<p>國際背景驚人透露</p>
<p>柏林二十二日中央社電德國新聞社訊：德組織部長雷伊博士，頃於星期六是向其火工廠人演說，對叛徒謀刺德元首未果加以說明，有驚人之透露。據稱，叛徒所用之炸彈，乃屬於超重型，係由英國輸入，雷氏并引某德勞工之語，以體實渠本人所言者。又謂德軍於東綫及義境後退，該叛徒等亦負一部份之責任渠，稱此種局勢將改變。被處死之凶犯有國際關係，其母為英籍，其妻為波籍，其嫂為蘇聯籍，故其作亂為一國際性之陰謀。雷氏開始演說時，即關明兀首之安全關係德之存亡，此次元首無恙，較某次戰勝尤為重要，蓋其含義即德人將獲勝利也。雷氏繼代表德人籲求上蒼庇護元首，并呼元首萬歲。</p>

<h3>老閘分局　破獲傷害案</h3>
<p>老閘分局於前日破獲一慘絕人寰之傷害姦污案，茲將詳情記之後：</p>
<p>信箱密吿</p>
<p>老閘分局在郵局設有「一八八七」號密告箱，任區內民衆檢學不法罪案，於本月十九日接得密告函一件，中述有「廣西路三二九弄慈德里卅號市花歌女社歌女香草，被客遍體火燙香烟洞八十餘處，且被姦污，但社主不准報告警局，企圖滅盡案跡，故請查究云云，當由賀分局長密令行政股陸輅主任負責澈查，陸主任即便衣至該社查案，將社主及歌女帶局偵查。</p>
<p>遍體被燙</p>
<p>由司法股探員二六六號偵查，先由賀分局長親自審詢，據歌女香草供述：「社名香草，原名毛小寳，甯波人，十七歲，住新閘路鴻慶里二號，在市花歌女社充任歌女，於本月十五日下午七時，由賬房派往束亞旅社三三〇號應徵，入房僅客一人在內，經一度數衍後，該客竟要求　歡，余堅決不允，客摸出手槍恐嚇，我仍置不理，致其惱羞成怒，用香烟先在我臂部刺燙，繼而暈厥，將我姦污，待我蘇醒，全身極痛，見四肢均是香烟洞，而客已不見，常晚茶房送回社中，但老闆周錦小不允報告警局而僅將紅藥水醫治云云，該社主竟不允報告，殊屬非是，當將周扣押，並令嚴跴兇手查辦，一面至東亞調查，在循環薄上查明該客名李桂芳，廿八歲，常州人，由探員繼續澈查</p>
<p>兇犯落網</p>
<p>兇手李桂芳於十九日上午一時至北海路三十五號袁寳興家，偽稱軍人，籍詞燈火洩漏，企圖詐欺，袁不服，不歡而散，至二十日，李與袁在路中相遇，致起口角，繼而動武，由崗警帶老閘分局，仍由華探二六六號經辦，經李供述姓名年齡籍貫，該探因其姓名與東亞循環簿者完全相付，即起疑寳，當由該毛小寳到局認明屬實，該案即於四十八小時內破獲。該局對是案甚為關注，俟偵查完竣後，當解地檢署依法從嚴懲辦。</p>
<h3>二區專員公署　擇定地址</h3>

<h3>第二警局　設龍華分局</h3>
<p>龍華鎭為滬市西南屏藩，地處重要，市第二警察總局為鞏固該處治安起見，特呈奉巿府核准，添設龍華警察分局，配備相當警力，並委由高維齋為該分局局長，刻巳就緒，昨臼起正式宣告成立。</p>
<p>短評</p>
<h3>新房屋實施時應注意之點</h3>
<p>本市財政局為增裕稅收，對於房捐捐率擬加合理調整，決定房捐額以估價定之，這辦法在原則上我們認為是合理的。不過，為期獲致「增裕市政稅收」的實效，應注意如下幾點：</p>
<p>估價標準的規定，同時應注意地段繁榮與否的程度，鬧市與閒市房屋應有區別。</p>
<p>估價依合理標準決定後，應收房捐數額即已確定，不妨公開宣佈。或在征收機關佈告處分區分期佈告新房捐數目，俾使納稅人知所遵從。據我們所聞，新房捐數目雖已決定而並不公布，於是若干不肖的征收房捐外勤人員，分赴納稅人處，詭稱房捐應增若干倍，如能給付相當酬勞，即可代為設法减低估價，納稅人信以為眞，以為一次付出酬勞，即可經常少付房捐，無不樂從。甚且里弄臣屋，類似公開募捐方式作此非法之舉。但其結果在財政局主管部分已將估價確定，未能推翻，於是納稅人平白地遭受損失。</p>
<p>財政局對於外動人員，應加嚴格甄別，特別注意操守一項。如發現作弊情事，應即扣送警局懲辦。</p>
<p>此外，我們希望納稅市民切勿食圖莫須有之便宜，受騙損失。同時，如遇此類情事，應即報警或拒絕，不使不肖份子索詐得逞。</p>
<p>市政革新，建設新上海，原不是市政當局單方面的事，也不是市政當局單獨力址所能完成。市民同樣有其責任，必須全體市民充分協力，則一切市政弊竇，索詐欺騙之事，可以漸次絕跡。</p>

<h3>種族問題與美國政治危機</h3>
<p>人種混雜的美國，現在正因少數民族，尤其是黑人問題，而逐漸釀成政治的輿社會的混亂。此次世界大戰的性質，正趨向於民族鬥爭之際，美國自人對於黑人的優越感及蔑視，比較平時更見露骨，可不問而知。但一方面美國國內情勢，要求黑人從事的戰爭努力，變本加厲，這是一個矛盾的悲劇。</p>
<p>時至今日，白人社會的中心經能，已許黑人大衆積極參加。戰爭以來，軍需產業劃期的增大結果，白人勞動人數不足，現在美各軍需部門，已許社曾各階層參加。而十八世紀末葉以來，固居南部農業地帶的黑人，大衆勢盛，有集中中西部及東部諸州的傾向。在這進出的過程中，不久前乃有底德羅州及紐約州等處黑人與白人的衝突的流血事件。</p>
<p>悲劇的主要因素，要遠溯到以前，當初林肯雖頒布解放黑奴命令，但黑人大衆，發覺自己仍不過是奴隸而已。第一次世界大戰時，標榜「與白人平等」「為擁獲民主主義」口號，驅使黑人流血，戰後黑人又被壓在底層。飽受痛苦經騐的黑人，再也不相信盎格魯撤克遜人的所謂民生主義了。所以當第二次大戰開始之初，美國國內反戰運動的背後，暗暗形成一種勢力，即對於前次大戰與今次大戰，黑人大衆的態度之差異。換言之，空泛民主主義和自由主養的眞相，黑人大衆巳開始逐漸認識淸楚，而圖利用白人社會的混亂情形，確立黑人的社會地位至某種程度。近代的戰爭不能避免長期化，利用「時」的機會已到，黑人以前次大戰與戰後的經騐為基礎，漸有澈底的實利主義傾向。</p>
<p>這種趨勢當然影響及於政治。例如本年秋季的大選，黑人的投票問題，為論爭的重心。四月三日美國最高法院，判決台克慶州民主黨預選，該州黑人有投票可能，道是例外的·美國的憲法，對於黑人，承認其有和白人同樣的選舉橫，間是事實，但根據各種規章和習慣等，對於黑人的選舉權，予以很大的限制。例如北部各州，對於黑人白人的投票差別待遇，比較緩和，有投票權的黑人，約三百萬左右·至於人種差別觀念根深蒂固的南部，黑人殆無投票的自由可言。所以最高法院的判決，在南部的白人間發生重大影響。</p>
<p>從來南部方面黑人干涉政治為不可能，其理由之一，為獲得投票資格，必須納投票稅。投票稅率通常極底，至多每人每年美金一元至五元，但黑人大衆為應付美國社會的最低生活水準，繳付投票稅也非易事，不過在此戰時繁榮之下，黑人也受其專，故毅然放棄一向對選舉退縮的態度，而堅決爭取與白人平等的投票權。南部向來是民主黨的堅強地艦，倘若反對羅斯福派的一部份議員與共和黨中的反對新政派，予黑人大衆以可乘之機，展開新型的選舉運動，結果未可等閑視之。</p>
<p>因了黑人大衆積極攻勢而感受狼狽，白人議負的評論家們一齊展開筆陣，向黑人勢力，大張　伐，例如密西西比州參議員畢爾浦曾作極端言論，主張「將美國黑人悉數驅出，放逐於西菲洲祖國」。同時著名女作家賽珍珠最近亦發表言論道：「黑人的指導者們，自始就不相信美國為民主主義而戰，而且道種思想來勢汹汹，浸透於全美一千二百萬黑人間。往昔美國有支配人種與被文化人種之別，實為可行，宜及早修正憲法，明示黑人不能享受白人的特權。」</p>
<p>美人愛好標榜的博愛，自由，平等的理想，可由此種言論測其底蘊。要之，戰爭態激烈化，白人和黑人的對立愈甚，美國政治上的危機也態重大。（譯自五月三十日護賣報知）</p>
<h3>日本婦女努力參加生產工作</h3>
<p>日本婦女努力參加生產工作</p>
<p>決戰！突擊！現在一億國民，不問男女老幼，都必須迅速參加總力戰鬥崗位。</p>
<p>徵用婦女問題，遠在三年前業已高唱入雲，由於種種客觀事實而未見諸實行，後決定組織女子挺身隊，而對於國家所頒佈的「婦女們這樣作吧！」的命令，全國婦女立刻遵寸執行。為父母者，有對於少年飛行兵志願的認識不足者，同探對於女子挺身隊，母親也有認識不淸者。</p>
<p>自然勿庸諱言，日本婦女的體格，比較歐美人是多少有缺欠的。所以外國車站上的女搬運夫，烏克蘭的鐵鑛女工以及起重機運輸女工等，實在是日本婦女所難於望其項背的。然而一般人都承認，日本人，尤其是日本女人，手是非常巧的。加利用這一特長，則工作是非常多的。在軍需品方面，適於婦女的工作，或婦女更為適合的工作，也不勝枚舉。然而由於婦女不肯出來作工，和由於女工不足，不得巳而徵用男人以代替女工的工場，也比比皆是。假如今日婦女源源而加入挺身隊，或勇躍參加生產，則從事於婦女更為適合的工作之男人，將不得不改變自己的職業，參加非男人不可的笨重吃力工作。這樣縱或一時會造成效率降低的現象，然而男工不足的不良現象，可以避免。業已參加女子挺身隊的少女，其母親還有很多認識不足者。有很多不明事理的母親，認為女校畢業後的女兒，應首先去作事賺錢。說明這一點的證據，就是。從頒佈男子就業禁止令後，各部以及丸之內事務方面，都有婦女來請求錄取，其中甚至有成為「女人國」者。再進一步來着，即進入工場者之中，也是想担任事務方面者非常的多。</p>
<p>縮减事務人員</p>
<p>現在所有的工塲，都在極力縮减事務方面的人員，當非用不可的場合，則把男子送到生產塲面去，而以女子來代替。</p>
<p>此處所說的生產塲面，一般不知道工場的人，就認為是職業塲所。整個工塲的任何一個崗位，全都是職業塲所。而職業塲所的職工，一般可分為二。即所謂直接工與間接工。但所有工場的間接工，平均為全體從業員的百分之三十。（最近經過數度研究，而間接工漸有减少的傾向）直接工也者，顧名思義：即直接從事生產的工人，間接工也者，就是担任庶務，會計，醫務等間接工作者。</p>
<p>在事務部服務，就是担任間接工的意思，目前就是必須極力縮减間接工的時期。今日的女子都在想當間接工，而母親們也在盼望自已的女兒如此作。</p>
<p>如聽到這樣說明，則立刻就會知道一向過去的想法是誤繆的。</p>
<p>間接工業已滿員了。而希望來參加的是直接工。總之，就是生產場面。</p>
<p>期待婦女參加</p>
<p>婦女所能担任的工作，或更近合於婦女的工作，都在期待着婦女的勇躍參加。不久前，關於某種工場僱用被保護少女事，司法省以及少年審判所，都曾進行過間討。少年審判所方面，曾非常愼重從事，認為須訓練兩個月，我說：「那末魷把這一問題放在將來再說，而在工塲中的生產部面，有怎樣最近合於婦女的工作，請先看一下，這種位置是在如何期待着婦女的參加，然後再決定婦女入場的時期」，於是大家去參觀工場。於是發現有很多工作，而最適合於婦女的工作到處都是，且這類位置多半都無人作。看到這種情形，且聽這種說明，而方才堅決主張「等待四月中旬再說」的頑固份子，也一變向來的態度，而就說：「現在看到了非常好的事情。趕快讓婦女參加生產吧！」</p>
<p>全都是日本人，因為不知道和沒看見，所以女兒和母親才有認識不足的缺陷。然而不能讓每個人都看一看工塲。請信任我，放心去參加生產！</p>
<p>「婦女們，現在立刻去參加生產吧！」</p>

<h3>女火車司機的筆記</h3>
<p>我們六個年靑女性，因為高舉着「鐵路即婦女戰場」的仙台鐵路局宮古機關區招考全國最初的女司機員，而來應徵，於是從很多投考者巾被錄取，在參加運輸戰綫而常女司機之前，而從早到晚，都在汽笛聲中煤烟層裏，精神百倍地服務着。</p>
<p>最初來到機關區的時候，看到在此勞動着的大家，都變成相互不能認識眞面目的黑面垢手，而在忙忙碌碌地手脚不停，拼侖勞動，這眞使我們佩服。</p>
<p>主管人說；</p>
<p>「妳們看怎樣？能够作像這樣黑面垢手的工作麼？」</p>
<p>我立刻毫不加思索，地就回答：</p>
<p>「一定可以作到令人滿意的地步。」</p>
<p>這樣氣壯的回答，竟使主管人和顏悅色地鼓勵我說：</p>
<p>「是為了打倒英美，請堅持下去！」</p>
<p>此外區長先生也訓示了好多話，於是使我們女流心血沸騰，決心以表示不亞於男人。</p>
<p>領到藍色工作服和帽子，而穿到身上時，覺着全身細胞，業已成為男十漢，而勞動的決心態益鞏固，業已覺着成為一位庫內手，而胸際愈益擴大。</p>
<p>火車頭在傍邊看，眞是一個龐然大物。爬上車顯，一件一件地擦洗機器，淸刷灑掃魷是最初的工作，在勞動着的期間，便知道了那是通風器，這是注水器。在工作中逐漸加深了理解火車頭的各部。</p>
<p>然後去淸洗倉庫。工作就是抬鐵扛木，從未抬過架重物的我，扛著東西走路，却是一件難事。看着且很担心我的主管人，和靄地說過幾遍：</p>
<p>「不要作得太過份！」</p>
<p>但自己的心中認為不服氣，於是便咬緊牙關，拼命作去。回家的時候，已經筋疲力竭，手脚和肩勝在隱隱作捅，但過了一星期，便習愼了，而也作得很好了</p>
<p>突破了這一難關，又總到砂屋去工作。砂屋，就是把火車頭下坡時使用的細砂烤乾，而裝到車頭上。烤乾細砂，是用鐵銑把細砂裝到大鍋裹，然後用火燒。裝細砂的工作，也是非常吃力的工作。烤乾的細砂，再用細絲網篩過，作坊裏滿是砂烟，迷眼撲鼻的這種工作，實在難熬。</p>
<p>然而理在一切都作慣了，無論是砂屋的工作也好，扛木抬鐵也好，擦洗機器也好，任何工作都有自信能作了。樂已感覺到自已確實有了一個庫內手的資格，每天都歡天喜地工作着。於是上司們都在談論：</p>
<p>「婦女若認眞作事，則比男人選能幹。」</p>
<p>「眞是大家都很努力，的確有成績。」</p>
<p>聽到這樣話，情緒愈發堅定，而心中想拼命幹一下，讓他們再更加驚嘆。尤其是我，假如帶一個試用的女庫內手被人說「終究還是女人不行」這樣話時，後來的婦女就會被人輕視的。無論什麽事情發生，也不能認輸。總得呌人認為「婦女也能作出偉大的事來」，旣負着這樣大的責任，當然要拼命地幹。幸而一天也沒有曠工，而竟戰勝這樣艱難困苦的工作，大家都鼓舞着說，眞勝任愉快，且受着各位的親切指導，所以自信愈強了。</p>
<p>近來公餘之暇，往往坐在憧憬已久的駕駛台傍，把着推進機，眞覺得心曠神怡，像業已成為一個司機一樣，於是能自在眉飛色舞中透露出希望來。為了取得戰爭的勝利，對於任何事情，婦女也應當代替男人工作。同時自己也感覺到自已任何事情也能作。</p>
<p>前綫上的哥哥來信說，把他那一部份的事也作出來，所以我也要作事哥那一份工作，決心為國家服務，站在目已的職業崗位上，盡力作到美　的地步。（內山淺）（季譯自四月十六日週刊每日）</p>

<h3>決戰階段下的日本戲劇動向</h3>
<p>— 大山功</p>
<p>自從大東亞戰爭爆發以來，業已將近三年了，而日本正在高度艱苦作戰中。在陸海空三方面的第一綫上不必說，就是大後方的一萬萬國民，也不得不實行各方面的總力戰。在這樣生死存亡之秋，剷除政治，經濟，文華等各方面的自由主義舊體制，而實行全體主議的新體制，這毫無疑問是當然中的當然事</p>
<p>確立演劇路綫</p>
<p>對於榮榮術，尤其對於演劇過去那樣最落後的意識形態，路綫仍然未變。自然，比較起政治或經濟那樣第一綫的尖銳戰鬭象，演劇方面是不容諱言，瞠乎其後的。雖然如此，但今日的日本演劇，亦在走向戰國方面，道是任何人都不能不承認的專實。</p>
<p>尤其不久前施行決戰非常措置以後，道一進步傾向，愈益明顯，至於前此動輒左顧右盼，遲遲不前的那種情形，逐漸在肅淸着，並且向着眞正泱戰時期的演劇體制長足猛進着。在運一方面表現着各種混亂，呈出各種荊棘，尚未有好的成果，但目前所進行的方向，不能不說業巳確立，是向這一目標努力前進着，道就是今日日本劇團所不可爭論的現實姿態。</p>
<p>改組戰鬭戲劇</p>
<p>那末決戰階段下的日本戲劇，是向那一方向前進？採取何種具體形態？以何種現實姿態出南呢？</p>
<p>不待言，決戰階段下的日本戲劇前進的方向，只有一個。這正如今日一般人所說的「戰蘭性戲劇」字樣所表示，以確立戲劇的木來姿態，完成戲劇的根本使命，藉此以走向國家總力戰有效的一個文化方向。（這決不限於決戰階段，承平時代也必須如此。然而特別在戰時，是必須特別加以强調的。）這一點在一切部門的戲劇方而，是當前毫不容緩，必須走向戰觀方向，此即迫切得任務。</p>
<p>國民的文化財</p>
<p>決戰階段下的日本戲劇，是向着這樣方向前進着，在是體方而，究竟採取何種形式而出現呢？首先可以說，應常戲劇文化的普及，觀賞戲劇機會均等等。過去我們日本的戲劇，多半都集中於大都市，被一般有閑的消費階級所獨占，所獨享，至於一般國民大衆，是無任何擺利享受的。就是要矯正這種畸形現象：使戲劇成爲名實相符的全國人民實貴的文化財。尤其在愈演愈烈的決戰階段上，對於勞苦功高的產業戰士，是計整使其享受優先的觀劇權的。</p>
<p>道一點由於日本流動劇國聯盟的形成（一九四一年六月）而具體實現出來，在情報局的積極指導下，以及各種文化團體，各種娛樂組織的善意協助，又加上產變報國和產業公會等職業團體的合作，所以活動一年比一年活潑起來了。尤其是非常措置後，情報局內設立流動藝術本部，於是這一運動更加積極地受到統制，而活潑起來，這種活動前此都有極大成就。這一運動在日本本國不必說，就是朝解，　太，滿洲，台灣，中國等各地，也都有普及的形勢。</p>
<p>大都市的聽業演劇，也逐漸加强這種傾向。例如東京和大阪等地的大戲院，遠曰非常措置前，業已開始的慰勞產業戰士的演劇，自非常搭置後更如積極化，其慰勞次數亦大加增多，同時又有戲票五元以下的限制，以限制過去那樣有閑消費階級，而對於產業戰士多與以優先的觀劇機會，於是前此無力觀劇的多數國民，亦有了娛樂機會，這可以說表現出來動員新觀衆曆的新現象。</p>
<p>疏散劇人劇團</p>
<p>由於這種非常　　，而限制不得超過五元戲羣這件事，對於今日職衆劇國，不能不說是一個大的打擊。在過去娛樂形態的時候，這樣票價（其中一半爲損）是要賠賬的，尤其大歌舞劇團是這樣感覺着。所以現在的演劇，差不多的戲院都分爲晝夜兩塲，但這樣也往往不能使收支平衡，實行非常措置後，很多大戲院都倒閉了，於是戲院內部必然發生了經濟的破壤作用，演員本身的生活降低，向咨動劇團積極轉變，演員改行等等，　成劇團的改組與整頓。</p>
<p>這樣事情，毫無疑問對於今日資本王義的娛樂形能，自然是一個打擊。但從演劇本身說，或從戲劇文化說，反倒是一件可喜可賀的事。此外，自從非常措置後，對於演員和劇團加以疏散，逐漸熱烈談論着了，有一部份業巳逐漸實行，這也是可注意的一個現象。（未完）（安譯自七月六日每日新聞）</p>
<p>國民論壇</p>
<h3>高利貸與升斗小民</h3>
<p>— 子嘉</p>
<p>高利貸的取締，雖說法律上早有明文。可是，法律自法律，軍實自事實。現在銀行抵押放款，自月息五分至一角五分。即年息百分之六十至百分之一百八十。此僅按單利計算，若按複利計算，爲數尤鉅。</p>
<p>倘更進一步，看看典當舖的利息，更屬駭人聽聞。典當舖的利息是按照月息二角五分計算，即每百元，月息二十五元。年息三百元，竟達本金百分之三百。與升斗小民關係較切的，不是銀行，而是典當舖。假使有人，以典當度日，其負擔無時不在他的實際支出的三倍以上。此問題的嚴重性固不在米價，煤價之下。</p>
<p>現在一般的典當舖雖門外掛着當字。但自稱爲「新舊物品買賣業」。當稟也改稱爲「特約定期買回證。」贖當的期限縮短爲三十天。只填明賣價數額，即按照當本，加年息百分之三百，預先填入，並不寫明月息或年息字樣，其方式甚爲巧妙。此項「特約定期買回證」計分「物品名稱」，「賣價數額」「賈主姓名住址」等欄。並附加說明如下：</p>
<p>「右開貨物及賣價，經於發給此證時，雙方交付淸訖。爲便利顧客起見，承認出賣人之要求，將上項收買貨物，暫代保留三十天。在保留期問內，出賣人如需要原物，得隨時備足價款，買回原物。到期即杆轉賣，不得異議。倘上項貨物，如有發生歷來不明情事，概由出賣人負責，與本號無涉，特此聲明」。上海一埠可說是五舟一常，十步一與。與典當實往來，以典當爲周轉資金的升斗小民，也許耍在一百萬上下吧，若以平均每人千元計算，就要達到十萬萬元。其中七萬萬五千萬元，都是屬於利息的負擔，高利貸的支出。這是一個值得注意的問題。這也是一個應該用法律手續，社會輿論的力量早早加以救濟的。</p>

<p>不等新田少尉的說明，而看到灣內礪頭上有一艘呂號潛水艇，在碇泊着，其甲板上的踏板，看着很　鯨魚背一樣。在那個踏板上走的時候，隆夫心裹想，過去只是在這處眺望潛水艇，而現在終於跑到牠的內部來仔細看了。道一點，實令人興奮。</p>
<p>從艦橋上按着鐵梯子拾級而下時，就只覺着內部的沉澱污渴空氣，和電燈的光綫兩件東西。</p>
<p>「決未想到這樣狹仄吧！」</p>
<p>眞人微笑着道樣說，隆夫啞然不知如何回答。不僅狹仄，而且這樣複雜錯綜的「鐵屬精工」也從未看見過。甚至司令塔的潛望鏡周圍，也密密地捲着鐵圈和鐵管。一看發令所，裏面充滿着訟人頭痛的許多機器。</p>
<p>尙未看完發射管室，推進機宇，電動機室時，隆夫的腦海業已有些混亂了。潛永艇的動力機有兩具，排池水和空氣的鍋　等預備知識，完全忘得一乾二凈。他自己覺着自己像一粒徽塵，而藏入了鐵的機器內部。或許覺着跳入鯨魚腹中，更爲相像。</p>
<p>「呵，謝謝！」</p>
<p>在士官室看到棹子和椅子時，才稍徽淸醒過來，於是隆夫這樣說了。</p>
<p>「沒有什麼，只要一慣，就像自已的家一樣。」</p>
<p>新田少尉也跑到棹子前面來坐下。</p>
<p>「這個地方是士官的臥室兼書房，食堂和全體船員的過路。那個布帘裏面就是艦長室……」</p>
<p>隆夫向裏一看，只有一蓆之地，差不多完全被一張床所填滿，且在床上有蛇般的鐵管在爬着，更有一個圓輪突出着，這眞是令人吃驚的事。艦長如一翻身，那個議管一定碰到自已的社皮上。</p>
<p>「這具潛艇因爲是在椗泊中，機器都停着，所以還容易忍受。」</p>
<p>眞人這樣解釋着。</p>
<p>「艇一動，就熱起來，也就發臭起來，眞是够受呵！」</p>
<p>新由少尉這樣揰了一句嘴。甚至在一個狹仄的士官室裏有他們三個人，所以氣味也相當大。</p>
<p>「喂，有神龕麼？」</p>
<p>隆夫這樣高聲地問。（一二二）</p>

<h3>Awakening Scientific Consciousness - Starting with "Dart Throwing" -</h3>
<p>— Jiang Yugui</p>
<p>Recently, walking on the road, I often see children throwing small wooden sticks at each other, shouting repeatedly, "Dart throw, dart throw!" This is similar to wielding the Azure Dragon Crescent Blade and the Pear Blossom Spear; the "dart" is Huang Tianba's, in reality Er Dun's, secret weapon, while the Azure Dragon Crescent Blade and the Pear Blossom Spear are the weapons of Guan Yu and Xue Dingshan. However, even if today's students all become Huang Tianbas and Xue Dingshans in the future, will China become good?</p>
<p>Foreign students, on the other hand, throw model airplanes on the street and play with toy trains and machine guns at home, constantly stimulating their scientific and military literacy and inventive intelligence. That is why foreign countries have ultimately become modern nations.</p>
<p>Most Chinese middle school students read romance novels, write short essays for newspapers, or try hard to put out small literary publications. They are always as afraid of science as they are of tigers and wolves. Foreign middle school students, on the other hand, read science magazines, some publishing their very simple inventions, and some learning to make models of airplanes and warships according to the instructions. As a result, the thinking of Chinese youth is focused on personal enjoyment, romantic fantasies, and a "don't care" attitude towards the nation. The thinking of foreign youth, on the other hand, is progressive, practical, and down-to-earth.</p>
<p>Chinese university students study law, because law is fashionable, and they are bearing the mission of transforming China into a country ruled by law. Chinese university students study commerce, because the banking sector is prestigious and comfortable. Chinese university students study literature; some study ancient books, hoping to preserve or promote national essence, some study Western literature to improve China's corruption, and others study politics and economics. After graduation, if they have connections, they can immediately become high-ranking officials.</p>
<p>Foreign countries have agricultural universities, industrial universities, colonization universities, fisheries schools, and mining schools. Those university students are like workers. They don't have the titles of lawyers, bankers, or politicians in their heads. They only know how to work hard to learn technology, hoping to become technologists in the future.</p>
<p>However, foreign countries have become scientific nations, while Chinese villages are always closed off by feudal ideas. The means of production are not improved. The few light industrial factories around the major cities use a small amount of machinery, but the machinery is bought from foreign countries. Ultimately, Chinese products are inferior to foreign ones, and China becomes an economic market.</p>
<p>But then again, why are students, middle school students, and university students not interested in science? The reason is that Chinese parents and educators do not work hard to promote science; or it is due to economic constraints. But why don't parents give their children the money they spend on Azure Dragon Crescent Blades to buy toy trains? Why don't educators use the money they spend on establishing universities and middle schools to open a simple industrial school?</p>
<p>The fundamental reason is that Chinese people lack a scientific understanding, so they are unwilling to give their second generation a scientific education, and at the same time, they have a kind of fear of difficulty towards science, so they carelessly do not delve into it.</p>
<p>But if we think carefully, or look through history, and look at the paths of development of other countries, is there any other way to develop into a modern nation besides scientific means? I'm afraid not. All modern nations have gone through a scientific stage. So, unless our country does not want to become a modern nation, the approach to science is an unavoidable thing. Since it is unavoidable, how can everyone hold a careless attitude and not delve into it?</p>
<p>The evolution of countries in the world, if divided by science, we can divide it into three stages: the first is the pre-scientific era, the second is the era of scientific invention, and the third is the era of applied science. The first era is the era of theocratic politics dominating society, where people live under a kind of spiritual constraint! The second era is the period of enlightenment of modern nations, when scientists such as Newton, Benjamin Franklin, Watt, Darwin... etc. invented scientific applications. The third era is the era of applied science. In addition to material life, the application of science sometimes reaches the realm of spiritual life. Now the advanced countries in the world have all reached the third era.</p>
<p>We Orientals have a kind of advantage, that is, we can surpass the second era and leap from the first era to the third era. After the Meiji Restoration, Japan worked hard to adopt the essence of science and technology, and as a result, it steadily surpassed the second era and became a nation of the third era.</p>
<p>As long as China works hard, it can of course surpass the third era, and what is the tool for this transcendence? It is "science."</p>
<p>Now China is still stuck in the first era, because everyone still does not have a scientific understanding. However, in the first era, the ideals of all lawyers and others, such as transforming China into a rule of law, are like the ideals of children practicing flying swords and palm thunder. It is an impossible to realize "utopia." Only after going through the scientific stage and China becoming a country of the third era can other ideals be realized. Therefore, from any point of view, understanding science is really the first priority.</p>
<p>Now the time is of the essence, everyone urgently needs to approach science in a crazy way, engage in learning as much as possible, break the previous shrinking, and eliminate the mentality of neglect.</p>
<p>If China does not break out of the circle of the first era in a certain period, and does not use science to realize a nation of the third era, the Chinese nation will be destroyed, or with utopian ideas, become the second "Gypsy" in the world!</p>
<p>Now some people in China have become wandering Gypsies. They cannot live in their peaceful hometowns because of political and economic reasons, so they wander to other places. There are no families to provide food in other places, no property, no jobs, and they wander the streets day by day. Haven't they become Gypsies?</p>
<p>However, the Chinese people are always careless and do not care about the overall situation. Even if some people have full pockets, they can only be happy for a short time, and soon they will become Gypsies with the majority of people, or the entire nation!</p>
<p>Now the only indicator is that everyone should start from now and recognize "science"!</p>
<h3>Koiso and Yonai Two Generals Appointed as Prime Minister and Navy Minister; Shigemitsu Foreign Minister Concurrently Serves as Greater East Asia Minister</h3>
<p>The New Cabinet is Established</p>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – General Koiso of the Army and Admiral Yonai of the Navy were appointed to form a cabinet on the 21st.

<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Vice Minister Yamamoto of the Greater East Asia Ministry has held various discussions with Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, who also heads the ministry, regarding the Greater East Asia policy. Regarding the promotion of ministry affairs, it was decided to continue to use the Greater East Asia Declaration as the fundamental policy, and under this policy, to implement continental and southern policies. At the same time, the Greater East Asia transportation network will be strengthened, with particular attention to the close ties between Japan and the continent.</p>
<h3>Three Chief Secretaries of the Cabinet; Minister Ogata Concurrently Serves as Director-General of the Information Bureau; Miura is the Director of the Legislation Bureau and Secretary</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Minister of State Ogata, who is the Vice President of the Asahi Shimbun, a leading figure in the newspaper industry, has now been appointed concurrently as the Director-General of the Information Bureau, which is a special feature of the cabinet.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – At the first meeting of the new Japanese cabinet on the 22nd, the cabinet personnel were decided. At the same time, it was decided to dismiss Chief Secretary Hoshino, Director-General of the Legislation Bureau Moriyama, and Vice Minister of Munitions Kishi. The government also announced the appointment of Kazuo Miura as Director-General of the Legislation Bureau and Chief Cabinet Secretary.</p>
<h3>The First Meeting of the New Cabinet Was Held in the Imperial Palace Yesterday; Prime Minister Koiso Explained the Guiding Principles of Governance</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – The first cabinet meeting of the Koiso cabinet was held in the Imperial Palace from 4:30 PM on the 22nd. Prime Minister Koiso and all cabinet members attended. First, the Prime Minister reported on the process from his appointment to the establishment of the cabinet, and then exchanged views on the original draft of the Prime Minister's statement to the outside world, deciding to revise some of the wording, and deciding on the three chief secretaries of the cabinet. The meeting adjourned at 5:30 PM.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – General Koiso, the Prime Minister of Japan, recently issued the following statement: I, without considering my own abilities, together with Admiral Yonai of the Navy, received the imperial command to form a cabinet. Beyond gratitude, I am filled with fear. Now the war situation is extremely serious. In order to break through this unprecedented national crisis, the only way is for the nation to unite and crush the enemy's Anglo-American counterattack. The government will internally strive to closely integrate political and military strategies and strengthen various measures for national governance. At the same time, it will resolutely implement measures to carry out the war, striving for certain victory. Externally, it will consistently adhere to the previous diplomatic policy, thoroughly implement the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, and complete the Greater East Asia War. I hope that the people will trust and cooperate with the government's determination, truly recognize the gravity of the war situation, and without falling into anxiety, calmly and diligently overcome all difficulties, and contribute all their strength to the country.</p>
<p>The Newly Appointed Prime Minister's Broadcast Speech Affirms the Belief in Certain Victory</p>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Prime Minister Koiso gave a newly appointed broadcast speech at 7:00 PM on the 22nd, after the completion of the cabinet formation, expressing his fervent belief in fulfilling the duties of completing the war and the people and breaking through the war situation, and calling for the rise of 100 million people. The main points of the broadcast are as follows: This time, I, together with my ally, Admiral Yonai of the Navy, jointly received the imperial command to form a cabinet in this critical situation. I am filled with fear and gratitude. I can only rely on the imperial prestige and the united cooperation of the people, sacrificing myself and serving my duties to appease the imperial heart. The true meaning of the Holy War has been clearly stated in the imperial rescript, and everyone in the government and the public knows it. Moreover, the goals of the people's efforts have been clarified since the start of the war, and there is no need to repeat them. However, at this time, I still want to say one thing, that is, in the face of the current national crisis, our people's beliefs and their practice must be more thorough. The Greater East Asia War occurred after the Sino-Japanese Incident. This is based on the expression of the lofty national essence and the traditional moral spirit of the people. Therefore, we have established remarkable achievements abroad and increased our war capabilities at home. However, we must humbly and frankly reflect on the various situations in the country and give play to the inherent moral spirit of the people. We must also purify our hearts and cultivate ourselves. All 200 million of our compatriots should understand the true meaning of the national essence in the long-standing spiritual legacy, and understand the importance of the responsibilities we citizens bear at present. Therefore, we should stand up and open up a new world, bravely move forward, and firmly believe in certain victory. Now the seriousness of the war situation is in front of us. Therefore, for the sake of the revival of the island nation and the happiness of all mankind in the world, there is no other way but to devote all our strength. Our 100 million people should use the inherent traditional moral spirit and the belief in certain victory to overcome difficulties and preserve the glory of the country. This is the only way. I, without considering my abilities, intend to jointly promote morality with the people from this point of view, in order to enhance the material and spiritual war capabilities, strengthen close ties with allied countries externally, and move forward to achieve the war objectives. I believe that the people will surely resolutely strive for the war situation with the unity of gold and stone, and further cooperate with the government's decisive strategy. There is no doubt about this.</p>
<h3>Admiral Nomura Appointed as Military Councilor</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Admiral Takakuni Nomura, who was the Commander of the Kure Naval Base and then appointed as Minister of the Navy in the Tojo cabinet on the 17th, in place of Mitsumasa Yonai, was appointed as a Military Councilor on the 22nd. This affair was announced by the Japanese Navy Ministry on the 20th.</p>

<h3>Establishment of the Powerful Japanese Cabinet; The National Government Specifically Issues a Statement; Advancing Together with the Spirit of Allied Righteousness</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency) – In order to cope with the emergency and refresh the people's hearts, the Tojo cabinet in Japan carried out a general resignation on the 18th of this month. The cabinet organized by Generals Koiso and Yonai has completed its organization on the 20th, and the list of cabinet members has also been announced. The National Government specifically issued a statement, stating that the National Government is determined to maintain the spirit of alliance and righteousness of the past, concentrate human and material resources, and advance together towards defeating the Anglo-Americans. The statement of the National Government is recorded below: "This time, the Tojo cabinet, in order to deal with the major war situation and refresh the people's hearts, carried out a general resignation on the 18th of this month. The successor cabinet has officially announced that General Kuniaki Koiso and General Mitsumasa Yonai will jointly organize a powerful cabinet.</p>
<p>Looking back at the Tojo cabinet, during the period of two years and nine months, it received the declaration of war and launched the Greater East Asia War, destroying the Anglo-American invasion bases in East Asia in one fell swoop. It also signed the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty with our country and issued the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, so that the foundation of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere could be laid. Its great achievements will be remembered forever.</p>
<p>Now that the new cabinet has been established, it will surely have a more powerful new posture to adapt to this new situation. The National Government will still maintain the spirit of alliance and righteousness of the past, concentrate human and material resources, and advance together towards destroying the Anglo-Americans in order to obtain final victory. We hereby declare."</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Chu's Remarks</p>
<p>Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency) – The new Japanese cabinet was formed on the 22nd, and our Foreign Minister Chu specifically issued the following remarks: "The situation in the East is the most tense. Not long after I returned home, General Tojo soon received the declaration of war on December 8 and declared war on the Anglo-Americans, destroying the Anglo-American invasion bases in East Asia in one fell swoop. On the one hand, he signed the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty with our country, and on the other hand, he held the Greater East Asia Conference in Tokyo and issued a joint declaration. Internally, he completed the national wartime system based on the standpoint of total war. Externally, he united the nations of Greater East Asia and established the foundation of the Co-Prosperity Sphere. His great achievements have long been known to the world. This time, in order to deal with the current major war situation, he resolutely retired and gave way to the capable, and changed to Generals Koiso and Yonai to take on the arduous task and form a cabinet with a strong wartime system in order to complete the final victory of the Greater East Asia War. Finally, General Koiso was appointed as Prime Minister, and General Yonai was appointed as Navy Minister, so that the army and navy were more united in order to cope with the emergency. The Foreign Minister is still Mr. Shigemitsu, who has always been the highest economic advisor to our country and is admired by the people. It is expected that the future of Sino-Japanese relations will still maintain the spirit of the past, and we will cooperate more closely to create a different color for Greater East Asia.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency) – The new Japanese cabinet has been formed, and General Staff Officer Bao issued the following remarks: "Looking back on the Tojo cabinet since the launch of the Greater East Asia War, it destroyed the Anglo-American invading forces in East Asia in one fell swoop and laid the foundation for certain victory, which is truly a glorious achievement in history. Now that General Koiso is the Prime Minister, assisted by Army Minister Marshal Sugiyama and Navy Minister General Yonai, we know that the army and navy will cooperate closely, and there will be amazing developments in the future of the war. I deeply hope that the people of the country will follow the Chairman's instructions, work hard to increase production, and cooperate to complete the victory of the war. I also hope that the Chongqing side will realize their mistake as soon as possible, not double the Anglo-American propaganda, promote overall peace, and realize the common undertaking of a major mission.</p>
<p>Salute to the New Cabinet</p>
<p>Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency) – After the Japanese cabinet was formed, Foreign Minister Chu Minyi telegraphed Ambassador Cai, instructing him to pay respects to the new Japanese cabinet and convey his congratulations. The original telegram is as follows: "Tokyo, Ambassador Cai Ziping, this time the Japanese cabinet is reorganized, and the strength is even greater to cope with the emergency. This is very gratifying. From Prime Minister Koiso onwards, many are old friends. I hope that you will use this opportunity to pay respects and convey my congratulations. No separate telegram will be sent. Chu Minyi."</p>
<p>Our Government and Public Are Delighted</p>
<p>Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency) – After the list of new cabinet members of the allied nation was announced, all sectors of our government and public expressed their delight. The point that the new Japanese cabinet will be even more powerful has completely met our initial expectations. This is not only because the new Prime Minister General Koiso personally has skilled political hands and brains and an actively progressive personality, but also because the ministers of various departments, such as Minister of Home Affairs Tatsuo Odate, are all first-class talents who are highly regarded by the Japanese public and are famous at home and abroad. We can especially promote two points from this new cabinet selection: one is that the Japanese diplomatic policy will</p>
<p>Remain Unchanged</p>
<p>The re-election of Mr. Shigemitsu, who has vast diplomatic experience, as Foreign Minister can prove this, and there is no need to elaborate. Therefore, Mr. Shigemitsu's concurrent appointment as Minister of Greater East Asia, with his rich diplomatic experience, can be said to be exceptionally appropriate for uniting East Asia. In particular, Mr. Shigemitsu has deep connections with our country, so not only can we know that Japan's policy towards China will not change at all, but also from the overall character of the new cabinet, we can infer that it will be further strengthened. As for Mr. Sotaro Ishiwata, who was re-elected as Minister of Finance, he is a financial expert in Japan and used to serve as the highest economic advisor to our government not long ago. In the future, he will cooperate more closely with our country in finance, which is naturally expected. This can also be advocated in passing. The first point is that the character of this Japanese cabinet is more clear, so its political power in guiding the decisive battle will</p>
<p>Be Stronger</p>
<p>This can be proved by the personal experience of each of the cabinet members. For example, Minister of Education Harushige Nikan and Minister of Health and Welfare Hisatada Hirose, the former is a military man with a meticulous staff talent, and the latter is a meritorious figure in the sound grassroots system. As for Justice Minister Hiromasa Matsuzaka, he has held various positions in the judicial sector. In the past five years, he served as the Chief Prosecutor of the Tokyo High Court, equivalent to the Chief Prosecutor of the High Court in our country, and then rose to the Chief Prosecutor General, and has always been a famous figure in the legal world. What is particularly noteworthy is Minister of Home Affairs Odate, because his personality is extremely strong and his skills are brisk. In the past, while serving as the governor of Fukui Prefecture, he resigned due to disagreements with Tatsuo Yamazaki and other ministers of home affairs. He usually disliked political parties and refused to compromise. In the early days of the Greater East Asia War, when the Special City of Shonan was established, he</p>
<p>Was Known for Hard Work</p>
<p>and was appointed as the first mayor. Amidst the flames of war, he devoted himself to the restoration and construction of the entire city, and with a rough style, he restored Shonan to its pre-war situation in just over a year. When Tokyo was reorganized into a metropolis last year, he was invited by the Japanese government to be in charge of the preparations, and when the metropolitan system was completed, he became the first governor. Summarizing his life experience, he is quite creative. It is not difficult to predict that he will use his strong skills to promote the domestic wartime system when he takes office as Minister of Home Affairs during the war. Also, Minister of Agriculture and Commerce Shimada has a spirit and perseverance that are beyond the average, and he is especially good at words. Therefore, former Prime Minister Tanaka Giichi often praised him as a "politician who gallops in the midst of thousands of troops and horses." The strength of his ability is not difficult to imagine. As for Minister of Munitions Fujiwara, he is an industry tycoon who used to serve as Minister of Commerce and Industry. Under the Greater East Asia War, he engaged in</p>
<p>Munitions Production</p>
<p>with all his might. Therefore, in the Tojo cabinet, he was appointed as a Minister of State, taking charge of planning and increasing munitions production, and made outstanding achievements. Former Minister of Transportation and Communications Maeda was a senior member of the Seiyukai party and was usually taciturn. He once said that "the secret to living in the world is not to make meaningless remarks." His spirit of doing more and saying less is a representative of the Japanese national character. Minister of State Machida is known for his careful consideration. Minister of State Kodama has successively served as Minister of Colonial Affairs and Minister of Home Affairs. Minister of State Ogata is currently the editor-in-chief of the Asahi Shimbun, one of Japan's three major newspapers, and is a</p>
<p>Powerful Figure</p>
<p>in the Japanese newspaper industry. All of the above individuals have a firm and active personality, and with their enthusiasm for not fearing difficulties, they are taking charge of various departments of the decisive battle politics under Prime Minister Koiso. The strength and lineup of the cabinet can be said to be unprecedented, and with the addition of the army elder Marshal Sugiyama as the head of the army and Admiral Yonai as the head of the navy, the administration of decisive military affairs has these two pillars, which is enough to cope with any difficult situation. In summary, we can know that the cabinet members of the new cabinet include veterans, young people, those from political parties, civilian commentators, industry tycoons, and staff members. It can be said that they have recruited</p>
<p>Talents from All Walks of Life</p>
<p>and completed the situation of great unity. Therefore, it can be asserted that the strength of the cabinet and its ability to gain the trust of Japan and abroad are undoubtedly strong. As a result, it is expected that a new situation in the Greater East Asia War will unfold due to the emergence of this powerful cabinet. We can also absolutely trust that we will work together with the allied countries with a more determined determination in the future to strive for victory.</p>
<h3>Chairman Wang's Telegram Congratulating Japanese Prime Minister Koiso; Also Telegraphed Former Prime Minister Tojo</h3>

Since Your Excellency accepted this great responsibility, you have been resolute and decisive, overcoming all obstacles to resolve the current situation, eliminate the British and American forces in the Pacific, promote the unity of one billion people in Greater East Asia based on international morality, and lay the foundation for the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Your great achievements shine throughout the world. It is hoped that you will continue to cooperate tirelessly to complete this great undertaking. This is what is truly hoped for. Wang Zhaoming, Chairman of the National Government of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Japanese Dispatching Large Forces to Attack; Intense Fighting in Hengyang</p>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a Chongqing dispatch, the Chongqing military authorities announced the situation in Hengyang on the 21st as follows: The Japanese army has not abandoned its determination to attack Hengyang and is currently dispatching several divisions to attack the city. The fierce fighting between the two sides has lasted for twenty-five days. The Chongqing army is now increasing troop deployments to aid Hengyang and is advancing from the west and south of the city. Therefore, the fighting in this area is extremely intense. Furthermore, the Japanese army, located in the streets of Hengyang, is attempting to prevent the Chongqing army's reinforcements from joining forces with the defending troops under heavy pressure in the city.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a Chongqing dispatch: Zhang Pingqun, a spokesperson for the Chongqing regime, issued a statement on the 19th, stating that the Japanese army is gradually reinforcing the Hunan front with large numbers of troops and heavy artillery. Therefore, the battle of Hengyang has reached its climax. The Chongqing army dares not predict the outcome of this battle.</p>
<p>督戰隊迫驅作戰</p>
<p>The Supervisor Team Forcing Combat</p>
<p>Hunan Front, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - The 20,000 defending Chongqing troops inside the city of Hengyang are completely isolated due to being surrounded by the Japanese army. Although the Chongqing army's resistance is generally weak, the resistance of the Chongqing front line is quite strong. It has been determined that this is due to the Chongqing side dispatching a fighting force that shoots and kills anyone retreating from the front line from behind. Therefore, one day, the Japanese army waited for an opportunity to take advantage of the dark night to break into the Chongqing army's position in Hengyang city. However, around 9 PM that night, they suddenly saw Chongqing army activity. About a large Chongqing army unit, shouting "kill," counterattacked. As a result, the Japanese army lured them to the front of the position and suddenly launched a fierce attack from the left, right, and center, annihilating most of them and pursuing the Chongqing army retreating into the city. At this time, the Chongqing army at the front sorrowfully roared and attacked again. This was actually because the machine gun supervisor team was forcing them to attack forward. According to an English operational order picked up in a certain area, American officers are serving as commanders in the Chongqing army. In order to ensure their own safety, the American army is driving the Chongqing army to fight the Japanese army. This kind of cruel behavior has been seen repeatedly on the Burma, India, and Southern fronts. The American army's attempt to use the Chongqing army as a sacrifice to destroy mainland China is self-evident.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting on the West Coast of Omiya Island; Japanese Army Bravely Responding; Enemy Suffers Over 4,000 Casualties in Two Landing Areas</h3>

<h3>Enemy's Vicious Plot Foiled; German Political Situation Increasingly Stable; Frontline Generals Declare Loyalty to the Leader</h3>
<p>Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - Xu Lede, the chief interviewer of Haitong News Agency, commented on the atrocities and results of the conspiracy to harm Führer Hitler, stating: Several German generals and colonels conspired to harm the Führer and seize power, but they were immediately purged. Reports from various places came in a few hours later, indicating that the National Socialist regime was very stable and any attempt at a coup would fail. Last night, precautionary measures were taken in the center of Berlin, which were very new and did not involve a single shot or barbed wire, indicating that they were fully prepared and everything was calm. The responsible parties have not yet revealed the names of those involved in the conspiracy and rebellion. After the police investigation, the German authorities will issue a detailed announcement. Based on the already announced announcement, the person who attempted to carry out the conspiracy was Colonel Stauffenberg. The conspirators deliberately fabricated rumors that the Führer had died and issued false orders, but the orders were not carried out and had no response. General Beck (who had already retired) was also one of those involved in the rebellion. Beck was removed from his position as Chief of the Army General Staff in 1938, and he has now lost his life. In summary, there are three results of the failure of this conspiracy: 1. The small group of conspirators who betrayed the country has now been purged. 2. The Führer appointed General Himmler as the commander of the domestic defense forces and General Guderian as the chief of the general staff. 3. No group of people in the entire country supported the conspiracy coup. From this, it can be seen that the National Socialist country is extremely stable, and no other system can meet the needs of the German people. The enemy's vicious plot to overthrow the country was foiled within an hour.</p>
<p>Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - Haitong News Agency reports: Field Marshal Kluge, commander of the German forces in Western Europe, issued a declaration to his subordinates, expressing his continued loyalty to Führer Hitler. The text reads: Soldiers of the Western Front, a small number of dismissed officers attempted to kill the Führer, but the Führer was unharmed. Last night, he even broadcast to the people and soldiers that the criminals have been eliminated, domestic order is quite good, and the fighting at the front and rear continues. We soldiers are extremely indignant upon hearing this news. We will never allow a similar Austrian coup to occur as in 1918. We soldiers of the Western Front only know to continue fighting the enemy with unwavering determination and loyalty. Long live Führer Hitler, long live Germany. Furthermore, yesterday, the fighting on the Western Front continued as usual. The situation at the headquarters remained the same. Representative units at the front held a parade yesterday to show their loyalty to the Führer.</p>
<p>Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - German News Agency reports: General Weijie, commander of the German forces in Southeast Europe, recently telegraphed Führer Hitler, expressing his relief that the assassination attempt on the Führer failed and representing all German troops stationed in the Balkans in expressing their absolute loyalty. The commander of the 2nd German Mechanized Army Corps also telegraphed the Führer to express his loyalty. The commander of the German forces stationed in Norway also issued a statement to his subordinates regarding this matter.</p>
<p>The Rebellion Conspiracy Was a Flash in the Pan</p>
<p>Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - Haitong News Agency reports: Responsible parties here stated that after the Führer was unsuccessfully assassinated, Führer Hitler, Reich Marshal Göring, Propaganda Minister Goebbels, German Army Commander Keitel, and Navy Commander Dönitz communicated by telephone and were able to control the situation throughout. At the same time, German dignitaries made contact with other departments of Germany. Revealing the details of this conspiracy, the mastermind who placed the time bomb was Colonel Stauffenberg, who is 37 years old. He was used by a small number of ambitious rebels to carry out their plans. Documents discovered within a few hours after the incident proved that the rebels had close contact with one of the anti-Axis countries. Before the execution of the mastermind, the relevant perpetrators were thoroughly investigated, and truthful evidence was obtained. The rebels were organized by a small number of retired generals and some important officers in the reserve army. These generals have already retired, so they have no connection with the military. They have no prestige on the front lines or in the country, so the orders issued by the rebels were not followed on the front lines or in the country. After the incident, the rebels used a means of transportation managed by a certain lower-ranking officer to issue orders to the front-line and domestic troops. Fortunately, those who received the orders were able to immediately realize that this was done by the rebels and did not comply. Well-informed sources in Berlin said that the rebels had seized certain means of transportation, forcing the German Führer to deliver a speech at night. When the German Führer, Reich Marshal Göring, and Admiral Dönitz delivered their speeches, they did not yet know how long or to what extent the rebels could use their means of transportation. The development of the situation later proved that this speech had a preventive effect, so as not to give the rebels any basis for their orders.</p>
<p>International Background Revealed Shockingly</p>
<p>Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - German News Agency reports: Dr. Ley, Minister of Organization of Germany, recently gave a speech to his munitions factory workers on Saturday, explaining the unsuccessful assassination attempt on the German Führer, with shocking revelations. It is said that the bomb used by the rebels was a super-heavy type imported from England. Dr. Ley also quoted a German worker to substantiate his claim. He also said that the rebels were partly responsible for the German army's retreat on the Eastern Front and in Italy. He claimed that this situation would change. The executed murderer had international relations, his mother was British, his wife was Polish, and his sister-in-law was Soviet. Therefore, his rebellion was an international conspiracy. When Dr. Ley began his speech, he clarified that the Führer's safety was related to Germany's survival. The Führer's safety this time was more important than a certain victory, because its meaning is that the Germans will be victorious. Dr. Ley then represented the German people in appealing to God to protect the Führer and shouted "Long live the Führer."</p>

Wang Zhaoming, Chairman of the National Government of the Republic of China.

The Soviet army's target of attack was Limberg. The Soviet army launched an offensive on a broad front, attempting to encircle the city from the north and south at the same time. The Soviet advance on the west side of the city was blocked. In the north, the Soviet army used several infantry divisions and two tank corps to attack the German flank.

This measure is a consistent policy of the Soviet Union, because Korniychuk is a famous national writer. The Soviet Union initially appointed him as chairman as a facade for its liberation of Ukraine. Now that this facade is no longer needed, he has been dismissed. Manuilsky is a Jew and has no ethnic connection with Ukraine, so everything can be ordered by Moscow.</p>

<h3>Large Quantity of Rice Arrives in Shanghai; Prices Have Already Fallen Back</h3>
<p>Since the Rice Control Association exempted the purchase of rice transported into the city in quantities of ten piculs or less from the 12th of this month, the quantity transported in has been thriving daily. According to a recent investigation by various entry permit offices, the daily amount is about 10,000 piculs, with the most at Hu-Min Road, Hongqiao Road, and the Jianghai Customs North Station. The sources are mostly transported from Wuhu, Dexian, Gaoyou, Zhenjiang, Songjiang, Jiashan, Jiaxing, Qingpu and other producing areas to Shanghai. Large quantities of new goods are stored in designated warehouses. The city has gradually decreased due to the thriving number of sealings. Yesterday (22nd) it has retreated to within eight passes. It is reported that the organization and personnel of the Rice Control Association will be newly adjusted in the middle of next month, and various permit offices will also be reduced at the beginning of the month.</p>
<h3>Traffic Safety Week; Authorities Planning</h3>

<h3>Cotton Control Committee Inspects and Purchases Yarn</h3>
<p>The Cotton Control Committee of the Commerce Control Association, after taking over the yarn management office established after the Commerce Control Association purchased yarn, and the Yarn Purchase Completion Committee, has now organized a temporary yarn management committee under its authority. This committee will handle unfinished matters related to the purchased yarn and prepare for the centralized management, production, and distribution of yarn. It is reported that the committee is currently actively handling the inspection of previously purchased but unfinished yarn. Once the yarn inspection is completed, it will immediately proceed with the overall yarn distribution.</p>
<h3>Authorities Plan to Establish a Stock Stabilization Fund</h3>
<p>In order to promote production and guide investment in enterprises, the Financial Affairs Inspection Department of the Central Reserve Bank has formulated regulations allowing banks and firms to handle stock collateral loans. Although this has boosted morale, the stock market remains weak. To maintain legitimate investment in enterprises, the responsible authorities are planning to establish a stock price stabilization committee, carefully review applications for listing, and strictly limit new capital increases by companies. In addition, the Statistics Department of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange will send personnel to investigate the assets of companies whose stock prices have fallen below par value and those that have newly increased capital, as a reference for the responsible authorities.</p>
<h3>Reassessing House Tax Values in Each District</h3>
<p>The property tax assessment offices in various districts of this city have inconsistent valuation schedules, and in some cases, valuations are years out of date, differing significantly from current market conditions. This situation requires thorough rectification to increase tax revenue. Therefore, starting this autumn, house taxes will be reassessed in all districts based on the most recent rental situation. For self-owned or partially owned properties requiring valuation, accurate reassessments will be conducted for tax collection. The Municipal Finance Bureau issued orders to all its subordinate offices on June 19, year 33 of the Republic, to comply with these procedures.</p>

<h3>China Railway Restricts Passengers' Luggage</h3>
<p>In order to prioritize wartime transportation, the Central China Railway Company has reduced passenger trains, leading to increased disorder and crowding inside the carriages. Many passengers are experiencing extreme inconvenience. The cause of this chaos and congestion is that many passengers are only concerned with their own convenience, bringing large packages of rice, flour, and other items into the carriages, often two to four per person. Bringing excessive luggage into the carriages not only makes travel unpleasant for passengers but also damages the passenger cars. It is reported that the company will implement restrictions starting July 26th, allowing each passenger to bring only one piece of luggage weighing no more than 15 kilograms into the carriage. Luggage exceeding this limit must be consigned to the baggage room for transport. Violators will be fined 600 yuan in national currency per item, as a fee for transportation and a penalty.

<h3>Old Zha Division Cracks Assault Case</h3>
<p>The Old Zha Division recently cracked a brutal assault and rape case. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Confidential Report from Mailbox</p>
<p>The Old Zha Division has a confidential mailbox, number "1887," at the post office, for citizens to report illegal activities. On the 19th of this month, they received a confidential letter stating that "Xiangcao, a singer at the Shihua Singing Girl Company at No. 30, Cide Lane, 329 Guangxi Road, was burned with cigarettes in more than eighty places on her body and raped by a customer. The company owner does not allow reporting to the police, attempting to destroy evidence. Please investigate." Section Chief Lu Lu of the Administrative Section was secretly ordered by Bureau Chief He to investigate thoroughly. Section Chief Lu immediately went to the company in plain clothes to investigate the case, bringing the company owner and the singer to the bureau for questioning.</p>
<p>Burned All Over</p>
<p>Investigated by Detective No. 266 of the Judicial Section, Bureau Chief He personally interrogated the singer Xiangcao, who stated: "My stage name is Xiangcao, my real name is Mao Xiaobao, I am from Ningbo, 17 years old, and I live at No. 2, Hongqing Lane, Xin Zha Road. I work as a singer at the Shihua Singing Girl Company. On the afternoon of the 15th of this month, the accountant sent me to room 330 of the East Asia Hotel. There was only one customer in the room. After a brief conversation, the customer demanded sexual favors. I firmly refused. The customer pulled out a gun to threaten me, but I still ignored him. He became angry and burned me with cigarettes on my arm, and then I fainted. I was raped. When I woke up, my whole body was in extreme pain, and I saw that my limbs were full of cigarette burns. The customer was gone. The waiter brought me back to the company late in the evening, but the owner, Zhou Jinshao, did not allow reporting to the police and only applied red medicine." The company owner did not allow reporting, which is wrong. Zhou was detained, and a strict search for the perpetrator was ordered. An investigation was also conducted at the East Asia Hotel, and the customer's name was found to be Li Guifang, 28 years old, from Changzhou. Detectives continued the thorough investigation.</p>
<p>Perpetrator Caught</p>
<p>The perpetrator, Li Guifang, went to Yuan Baoxing's house at No. 35, Beihai Road, at 1:00 AM on the 19th, falsely claiming to be a soldier and attempting to defraud them under the pretext of a light leak. Yuan refused, and they parted unhappily. On the 20th, Li and Yuan met on the street, which led to a quarrel and then a fight. The officer on duty brought them to the Old Zha Division, and Detective No. 266 handled the case. Li confessed his name, age, and hometown. The detective suspected him because his name matched the one in the East Asia Hotel register. Mao Xiaobao was brought to the bureau to identify him, and she confirmed that he was the perpetrator. The case was solved within 48 hours. The bureau is paying close attention to this case and will hand him over to the district prosecutor's office for strict punishment according to the law after the investigation is completed.</p>

<p>Brief Commentary</p>
<h3>Points to Note When Implementing the New Housing Tax</h3>
<p>The Municipal Finance Bureau is planning to make reasonable adjustments to the housing tax rate to increase tax revenue, and it has decided that the housing tax amount will be determined by valuation. In principle, we believe this method is reasonable. However, to achieve the practical effect of "increasing municipal tax revenue," the following points should be noted:</p>
<p>The valuation standards should also take into account the degree of prosperity of the location. There should be a distinction between houses in busy commercial districts and those in quiet residential areas.</p>
<p>After the valuation is determined according to reasonable standards, the amount of housing tax to be collected should be fixed and announced publicly. Or, the new housing tax amount should be announced in phases and by district at the announcement office of the tax collection agency, so that taxpayers know what to comply with. According to what we have heard, although the new housing tax amount has been determined, it has not been announced. As a result, some unscrupulous field personnel of the housing tax collection agency go to taxpayers, falsely claiming that the housing tax should be increased by several times, and that if a considerable reward can be paid, they can help reduce the valuation. Taxpayers believe this is true, thinking that paying a reward once will result in permanently lower housing taxes, and they are happy to comply. Even neighborhood officials are engaging in this illegal activity in a manner similar to public fundraising. But the result is that the valuation has already been determined by the competent department of the Finance Bureau and cannot be overturned, so taxpayers suffer a loss for nothing.</p>
<p>The Finance Bureau should strictly screen external personnel, paying particular attention to their integrity. If any malfeasance is discovered, they should be immediately handed over to the police for punishment.</p>
<p>In addition, we hope that taxpayers will not try to obtain unwarranted advantages and be deceived into losses. At the same time, if you encounter such situations, you should immediately report to the police or refuse, so that unscrupulous elements cannot succeed in extortion.</p>
<p>Municipal innovation and the construction of a new Shanghai are not the sole responsibility of the municipal authorities, nor can they be completed solely by the municipal authorities. Citizens also have their responsibilities and must fully cooperate, so that all municipal malpractices and extortion can gradually disappear.</p>

<h3>Air Defense Song and Film Premiere Held Yesterday, Co-organized by Air Defense Headquarters and China Film Company</h3>
<p>In order to stimulate citizens' air defense awareness and instill general air defense knowledge, the Shanghai Special Municipality Air Defense Headquarters and the China Film Company jointly held an air defense song and film premiere tea party at the Hua Mao Hotel on the 8th floor yesterday (the 22nd) at 5:00 PM, inviting people from all walks of life. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Allied Japan was represented by the Army Air Defense Commander, Staff Officer Kumagai of the Army and Navy Air Defense Headquarters, the head of the Shanghai Liaison Department, the Commander of the Matsushima Fleet Report Department, the Chief of the Shirakami Police Station, and the Propaganda Director of the Yano Deng Unit, among others. On the Chinese side, there was Deputy Director Su Chengshui of the First Police Bureau, Chief Secretary Sun Lifu of the Air Defense Headquarters, and others, totaling more than 500 people. The conference began at 5:00 PM. First, Sun Lifu of the Air Defense Headquarters gave an opening speech, saying: "Today, despite the hot weather, we are holding this premiere of air defense songs and films. We are very honored to have so many guests attend. The Air Defense Headquarters has been established for less than a year. Most of our preparations for air raids have been focused on publicity work for the public. Now, with the assistance of the China Film Company and the Army and Navy Information Departments of the Allied Embassy, we have completed one-third of the air defense film, namely the first installment, the preparation chapter. After we publicly solicited air defense songs in the Shen Bao previously, we received more than 100 excellent songs. We selected the best one, written by Jin Yugu, and asked Liang Yeyin and Li Jinguang to compose the music separately. We will now screen the air defense film and sing the air defense song. We hope everyone will criticize it." Next was a prayer for the inevitable victory of Greater East Asia. After a minute of silence, the singing began. "The Great Shanghai March" (Li Lewu), "Moon Over the Ruined City" (Li Lewu), "Women's Tears" (Qi Zhengyin), "Las Spania Ola" (Qi Zhengyin), "Annoying Morning" (Gu Lu), "Unchanging Heart" (Wu Yong), "Anti-Smoking Song" (Liang Ping). Finally, they sang the Air Defense Song (No. 1), lyrics by Jin Wanggu, music and accompaniment by Liang Leyin, chorus (arranged by Li Lewu, a special member of the Asia Record Manufacturing Factory). Air Defense Song (No. 2), lyrics by Jin Yugu, music by Li Jinguang, chorus (Gu Ying, Wu Yong, Liang Ping, Zhang Hui, Zhang Yu, Huang Zhiguang, special members of the China Music Industry). Finally, the air defense film was screened. The film described in detail all the preparations that the public should make before an enemy air raid. It is believed that after the public watches it, they will gain considerable experience in air defense knowledge and various lighting control methods.</p>

<h3>Racial Problems and the American Political Crisis</h3>
<p>The United States, a nation of mixed races, is now gradually descending into political and social chaos due to ethnic minorities, particularly the Black population. As the nature of this world war increasingly leans towards ethnic conflicts, the sense of superiority and contempt that White Americans hold towards Blacks is becoming more blatant than ever. However, at the same time, the domestic situation in the U.S. demands intensified war efforts from the Black population, creating a contradictory tragedy.</p>
<p>Today, the White society's core functions have allowed greater participation from the Black masses. The significant increase in military industry since the war began has led to a shortage of White laborers, and now all sectors of society are permitted to participate in the American military. The Black population, which has been concentrated in the southern agricultural regions since the late 18th century, is now tending to concentrate in the Midwest and Eastern states. During this movement, bloody clashes between Blacks and Whites have occurred in places like Detroit and New York.</p>
<p>The main factors of this tragedy can be traced back to earlier times. Although Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, the Black masses realized they were still nothing more than slaves. During World War I, slogans of "equality with Whites" and "fighting for democracy" were used to drive Black people to shed blood, but after the war, they were once again suppressed to the bottom. Having endured painful experiences, the Black population no longer believes in the so-called democracy of the Anglo-Saxons. Therefore, at the beginning of World War II, a hidden force was forming behind the anti-war movement in the U.S., which represents the difference in attitude of the Black masses between the previous and current wars. In other words, the Black masses have gradually begun to clearly understand the truth about empty democracy and liberal ideology, and are trying to use the chaos in White society to establish the Black population's social status to some extent. Modern warfare cannot avoid becoming protracted, and the opportunity to utilize "time" has arrived. Based on their experiences from the previous war and its aftermath, Black people are gradually leaning towards thorough pragmatism.</p>
<p>This trend naturally affects politics. For example, the issue of Black voting rights is a central point of contention in this autumn's elections. On April 3rd, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Black people in Texas have the right to vote in the Democratic primary election. This is an exception because, while the U.S. Constitution recognizes that Black people have the same electoral rights as White people, in reality, various regulations and customs greatly restrict their right to vote. For example, in the northern states, differential treatment in voting between Black and White people is relatively mild, and approximately three million Black people have the right to vote. However, in the South, where racial discrimination is deeply rooted, Black people have virtually no freedom to vote. Therefore, the Supreme Court's ruling has had a significant impact on White people in the South.</p>
<p>Historically, Black people's interference in politics in the South has been impossible. One reason for this is the requirement to pay a poll tax to obtain voting rights. The poll tax rate is usually very low, at most one to five U.S. dollars per person per year. However, for the Black masses, meeting the minimum standard of living in American society makes it difficult to pay the poll tax. But under the current wartime prosperity, Black people have also benefited, so they have resolutely abandoned their past reluctance towards elections and are determined to fight for equal voting rights with White people. The South has always been a stronghold of the Democratic Party. If a portion of the anti-Roosevelt Democrats and anti-New Deal Republicans give the Black masses an opportunity to exploit and launch a new type of election campaign, the outcome should not be underestimated.</p>
<p>Feeling embarrassed by the Black masses' aggressive offensive, White parliamentarians and commentators have launched a barrage of written attacks on Black power. For example, Mississippi Senator Bilbo made extreme remarks, advocating for "the expulsion of all Black Americans and their banishment to their ancestral homeland in West Africa." At the same time, the famous female writer Pearl Buck recently stated, "Black leaders have never believed that America is fighting for democracy, and this idea is spreading rapidly, permeating among all 12 million Black people in the U.S. In the past, America distinguished between governing races and those being civilized, which was feasible. The Constitution should be amended as soon as possible to make it clear that Black people cannot enjoy the privileges of White people."</p>
<p>These remarks reveal the true nature of the ideals of universal love, freedom, and equality that Americans love to promote. In short, as the war intensifies, the antagonism between White and Black people becomes greater, and the political crisis in the U.S. also becomes more severe.

<h3>Japanese Women Strive to Participate in Production Work</h3>
<p>Japanese Women Strive to Participate in Production Work</p>
<p>Decisive Battle! Assault! Now, all 100 million citizens, regardless of gender or age, must quickly participate in the total war effort.</p>
<p>The issue of conscripting women was already loudly proclaimed three years ago. Due to various objective facts, it had not been put into practice. Later, it was decided to organize women's volunteer corps, and the women across the country immediately complied with the state's order: "Women, do this!" Parents have insufficient understanding of young men volunteering for the air force, and mothers also have unclear understanding of women's volunteer corps.</p>
<p>Naturally, it goes without saying that the physique of Japanese women is somewhat lacking compared to Europeans and Americans. Therefore, female porters at foreign train stations, female miners in Ukrainian iron mines, and female crane operators are really difficult for Japanese women to match. However, it is generally recognized that Japanese people, especially Japanese women, are very skilled with their hands. If this strength is utilized, there is a lot of work that can be done. In terms of military supplies, there are countless jobs suitable for women, or even more suitable for women. However, due to women's unwillingness to come out to work, and due to the shortage of female workers, there are many factories that have no choice but to conscript men to replace female workers. If women join the volunteer corps in large numbers today, or enthusiastically participate in production, then men who are engaged in work that is more suitable for women will have to change their occupations and participate in heavy, strenuous work that only men can do. Although this may temporarily cause a decrease in efficiency, the adverse effects of a shortage of male workers can be avoided. Many mothers still have an insufficient understanding of the young women who have already joined the women's volunteer corps. There are many unreasonable mothers who believe that their daughters should first go to work and earn money after graduating from girls' school. The evidence to illustrate this point is: after the ban on men's employment was announced, women came to various departments and Marunouchi offices to request employment, and there were even places that became "women's countries." Furthermore, among those entering factories, there are also very many who want to take on office work.</p>
<p>Reducing Office Staff</p>
<p>All factories are now doing their best to reduce office staff. When it is absolutely necessary, men are sent to the production floor and women are used to replace them.</p>
<p>What is meant by "production floor" here is generally considered by people who don't know factories to be the vocational workplace. Any position in the entire factory is a vocational workplace. The workers in the vocational workplace can generally be divided into two categories: direct workers and indirect workers. However, the indirect workers in all factories average 30% of the total number of employees. (Recently, after several studies, the trend is towards a reduction in indirect workers.) Direct workers, as the name implies, are workers who are directly engaged in production. Indirect workers are those who are engaged in indirect work such as general affairs, accounting, and medical services.</p>
<p>Serving in the administrative department means taking on indirect work, and now is the time when indirect workers must be drastically reduced. Today's women all want to be indirect workers, and mothers are also hoping that their daughters will do so.</p>
<p>If you hear this explanation, you will immediately realize that your past thinking was mistaken.</p>
<p>The indirect industry is full. What they want are direct workers. In short, it is the production floor.</p>
<p>Expecting Women's Participation</p>
<p>Work that women can do, or work that is more suitable for women, is expecting women to participate enthusiastically. Not long ago, the Ministry of Justice and the Juvenile Court had a discussion about the employment of protected girls in a certain factory. The Juvenile Court was very cautious and believed that two months of training were necessary. I said, "Then let's put this issue aside for the future. First, take a look at what kind of work in the production department of the factory is most suitable for women, and see how much this position is expecting women's participation, and then decide when women should enter." So everyone went to visit the factory. As a result, they found a lot of work, and the work that was most suitable for women was everywhere, and most of these positions were vacant. Seeing this situation and hearing this explanation, the stubborn people who had insisted on "waiting until mid-April" also changed their attitude and said, "Now we see very good things. Let women participate in production quickly!"</p>
<p>Everyone is Japanese, because they don't know and haven't seen, so daughters and mothers have insufficient understanding. However, you can't let everyone take a look at the factory. Please trust me and participate in production with peace of mind!</p>
<p>"Women, go participate in production right now!"</p>

<h3>Notes of a Female Train Driver</h3>
<p>We, six young women, came to apply for the position of the nation's first female train drivers recruited by the Miyako Engine District of the Sendai Railway Bureau, holding high the banner of "The railway is a women's battlefield." We were selected from many applicants and, before participating in the transportation front as female drivers, we serve from morning to night, with full spirit, amidst the sound of train whistles and layers of coal smoke.</p>
<p>When we first came to the engine district, we admired the sight of everyone working there, their faces and hands blackened with grime, barely recognizable, busy and constantly moving, working hard.</p>
<p>The supervisor said:</p>
<p>"What do you think? Can you do work like this, with blackened faces and grimy hands?"</p>
<p>I immediately replied without hesitation:</p>
<p>"I will definitely be able to do it satisfactorily."</p>
<p>This spirited reply made the supervisor encourage me with a smile:</p>
<p>"For the sake of defeating Britain and America, please persevere!"</p>
<p>In addition, the district chief gave us many instructions, which made the blood of us women boil, determined to show that we are no less than men.</p>
<p>When we received the blue work clothes and hats and put them on, we felt that all the cells in our bodies had become men, and our determination to work became even stronger. We already felt like a member of the depot, and our hearts were expanding.</p>
<p>The locomotive looked like a huge monster beside us. Climbing onto the car and cleaning the machinery one by one, scrubbing and sweeping was the first job. While working, we learned that this was the ventilator and that was the water injector. We gradually deepened our understanding of the various parts of the locomotive in the work.</p>
<p>Then we went to clean the warehouse. The work was to carry iron and wood. I, who had never carried heavy objects, found it difficult to walk while carrying things. The supervisor, looking worried about me, said gently several times:</p>
<p>"Don't overdo it!"</p>
<p>But my heart refused to give in, so I gritted my teeth and worked hard. When I went home, I was exhausted, and my hands, feet, and shoulders were throbbing, but after a week, I got used to it and did it well.</p>
<p>Breaking through this difficulty, we went to work in the sand house. The sand house is where the fine sand used by the locomotive when going downhill is dried and loaded onto the locomotive. To dry the fine sand, we used an iron shovel to load the fine sand into a large pot and then burn it with fire. The work of loading fine sand was also very strenuous. The dried fine sand was then sifted through a fine wire mesh. The workshop was full of sand smoke, making this work of stinging the eyes and nose difficult to endure.</p>
<p>However, now I am used to everything. Whether it is the work in the sand house, carrying wood and iron, or cleaning the machinery, I am confident that I can do any job. I already feel that I have a depot hand qualification, and I work happily every day. So the superiors are talking about:</p>
<p>"If women work seriously, they are more capable than men."</p>
<p>"Everyone is working very hard, and there are indeed results."</p>
<p>Hearing these words, my emotions became more firm, and I wanted to work hard and amaze them even more. Especially me, if a probationary female depot hand is said to be "after all, women are no good," then later women will be despised. No matter what happens, I cannot admit defeat. I have to make people think that "women can also do great things." Bearing such a great responsibility, of course, I have to work hard. Fortunately, I have not been absent from work for a single day, and I have overcome such difficult and arduous work. Everyone is encouraging me, saying that I am really happy in the job, and I am receiving kind guidance from everyone, so my confidence is getting stronger.</p>
<p>Recently, in my spare time, I often sit beside the long-awaited driver's seat and hold the propulsion machine. I really feel refreshed and happy, like I have already become a driver, so I can reveal hope in my relaxed expression. In order to win the war, women should also work in place of men for anything. At the same time, I also feel that I can do anything.</p>
<p>A letter from my brother on the front line said to do his share of the work as well, so I also want to do my brother's share of the work, and I am determined to serve the country, stand on my job position, and do my best.

<h3>The Trend of Japanese Drama in the Decisive Battle Stage</h3>
<p>—Isao Oyama</p>
<p>It has been almost three years since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, and Japan is fighting with great difficulty. Needless to say, on the front lines of land, sea, and air, the 100 million people in the rear must also implement a total war in all aspects. In this time of life and death, it is undoubtedly a matter of course to eliminate the old system of liberalism in politics, economy, culture, and other aspects, and implement a new system of collectivism.</p>
<p>Establishing a Drama Route</p>
<p>The ideological route for art and especially drama, which was the most backward in the past, remains unchanged. Naturally, compared to the sharp battles on the front lines of politics or economy, the drama aspect is undeniably lagging behind. Even so, today's Japanese drama is also moving towards the battlefield, which is a fact that no one can deny.</p>
<p>Especially after the implementation of the decisive battle emergency measures not long ago, this progressive tendency has become more and more obvious. The situation of hesitating and looking left and right before is gradually being purged, and it is making great strides towards a truly wartime drama system. Various confusions and thorns are manifested in the operation, and there are no good results yet, but the direction in which it is currently proceeding can be said to have been established, and it is working towards this goal. This is the undeniable reality of Japanese theater companies today.</p>
<p>Reorganizing Combat Drama</p>
<p>So, in which direction is Japanese drama in the decisive battle stage moving? What specific form does it take? What kind of realistic posture does it take?</p>
<p>Needless to say, there is only one direction in which Japanese drama in the decisive battle stage is moving. This is, as people say today, "combat drama," which means establishing the future form of drama, completing the fundamental mission of drama, and thereby moving towards a cultural direction that is effective for the national total war. (This is not limited to the decisive battle stage; it must be the same in peacetime. However, it must be especially emphasized during wartime.) In all aspects of drama, this is an urgent task that must be directed towards combat without delay.</p>
<p>The Nation's Cultural Property</p>
<p>Japanese drama in the decisive battle stage is moving in this direction. What form does it take in reality? First of all, it can be said that it should promote the popularization of drama culture and equal opportunities to watch drama. In the past, most of our Japanese drama was concentrated in large cities and monopolized by the leisure-consuming class. The general public had no right to enjoy it. This distorted phenomenon must be corrected: drama must become a cultural property that truly belongs to all the people of the country. Especially in the increasingly fierce decisive battle stage, priority viewing rights must be arranged for the hard-working industrial soldiers.</p>
<p>This has been concretely realized due to the formation of the Japan Mobile Theater Alliance (June 1941). Under the active guidance of the Information Bureau, the kind assistance of various cultural groups and entertainment organizations, and the cooperation of industrial service to the nation groups and industrial associations, the activities have become more lively year by year. Especially after the emergency measures, the establishment of the Mobile Arts Headquarters in the Information Bureau has made this movement more actively controlled and lively. This kind of activity had great achievements before. This movement is spreading not only in Japan, but also in Korea, Karafuto, Manchuria, Taiwan, China, and other places.</p>
<p>The hearing business drama in big cities is also gradually strengthening this trend. For example, large theaters in Tokyo and Osaka started performing plays to comfort industrial soldiers before the emergency measures, and they became more active after the emergency measures. The number of comforting performances also increased greatly. At the same time, there was a restriction on tickets below five yuan to restrict the leisure-consuming class and give priority viewing opportunities to industrial soldiers. As a result, the majority of the population who had no power to watch plays before also had entertainment opportunities. This can be said to show a new phenomenon of mobilizing new audiences.</p>
<p>Evacuating Actors and Theater Companies</p>
<p>Due to this emergency measure, the fact that the drama ticket price cannot exceed five yuan is a big blow to today's professional drama groups. In the past entertainment situation, this kind of ticket price (half of which is a loss) would be a loss. Especially the large revue group felt this way. So now almost all theaters are divided into day and night sessions, but even this often cannot balance income and expenditure. After the implementation of the emergency measures, many large theaters went bankrupt. As a result, the internal part of the theater inevitably suffered economic destruction. The lives of the actors themselves were lowered, and they actively turned to mobile theater groups, changed careers, etc., forming the reorganization and rectification of theater groups.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that this is a blow to today's capitalist entertainment. But from the perspective of drama itself, or from the perspective of drama culture, it is a gratifying thing. In addition, since the emergency measures, actors and theater companies have been evacuated, and there has been a lot of talk about it. Some of them have gradually implemented it, which is also a phenomenon that can be noted. (To be continued) (Translated from the July 6th issue of Mainichi Shimbun by Yasushi)</p>
<p>National Forum</p>
<h3>Usury and the Common People</h3>
<p>— Jiga</p>
<p>The crackdown on usury has long been stipulated by law. However, the law is the law, and the reality is the reality. Currently, bank mortgage loans range from 0.5% to 1.5% monthly interest, which is 60% to 180% annual interest. This is calculated based on simple interest only. If calculated based on compound interest, the amount is even greater.</p>
<p>If we take a step further and look at the interest rates of pawnshops, they are even more shocking. The interest rates of pawnshops are calculated at 2.5% monthly interest, which is 25 yuan per month for every 100 yuan. The annual interest rate is 300 yuan, which is 300% of the principal. What is more relevant to the common people is not the bank, but the pawnshop. If someone lives by pawning, his burden is always more than three times his actual expenses. The severity of this problem is no less than the price of rice or coal.</p>
<p>Currently, most pawnshops hang the word "pawn" outside their doors. But they call themselves "new and used goods trading business." Pawn tickets are also renamed "specially agreed fixed-term repurchase certificates." The redemption period is shortened to 30 days. Only the selling price is filled in, which is calculated according to the principal plus 300% annual interest, filled in in advance, and does not specify the monthly or annual interest rate. The method is very clever. This "specially agreed fixed-term repurchase certificate" is divided into columns such as "item name," "selling price," "seller's name and address," etc. It also includes the following explanation:</p>
<p>"The above-mentioned goods and selling price have been cleared by both parties upon the issuance of this certificate. For the convenience of customers, the seller's request is acknowledged, and the above-mentioned purchased goods will be temporarily retained for 30 days. During the retention period, if the seller needs the original goods, he can prepare sufficient funds at any time to repurchase the original goods. At the expiration date, it will be transferred for sale, and no objection shall be raised. If the above-mentioned goods have any unexplained circumstances in the past, the seller shall be responsible, and this store shall not be involved. We hereby declare." Shanghai can be said to be five steps one shop, ten steps one pawnshop. The common people who deal with pawnshops and use pawnshops as working capital may be around one million. If we calculate an average of 1,000 yuan per person, it will reach 1 trillion yuan. Among them, 750 billion yuan is the burden of interest and the expenditure of usury. This is a problem that deserves attention. This is also a problem that should be remedied by legal procedures and the power of public opinion as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Social Services</p>
<h3>Nanyang Hospital Offers Free Tuberculosis Prevention</h3>
<p>Mr. Xiannan Qun, the president of Nanyang Hospital, in order to benefit elementary school teachers, has specially established free tuberculosis prevention measures starting from May 1st. Since the implementation, a total of 245 people have been introduced by the social service departments of this newspaper and the News Daily to undergo examinations. Those with mild conditions are given outpatient treatment, free medication, or a discretionary reduction in medication costs, depending on their family circumstances. Those with severe conditions are allowed to be hospitalized for artificial pneumothorax or surgery, and the results have been very good. This free prevention and treatment measure is scheduled to end on the 31st of this month, and will not be extended. Therefore, it is hoped that all elementary school teachers will make the most of this good opportunity and go to the social service departments of the Shenbao and Xinwenbao before the deadline to obtain free X-ray examination certificates and go to the hospital for examination.</p>
<p>It is heard that in order to protect the health of students, the hospital will start providing free health examinations for children from August 1st. On the one hand, it will promote the healthy development of children, and on the other hand, after the source of the disease is discovered, it will be treated as soon as possible during the summer vacation, so that when school starts in the autumn, they will be physically strong and will not be in danger of being unable to attend school due to illness. Detailed measures will be formulated separately and can be decided soon.</p>
<h3>Pudong Fellow Villagers Scholarship</h3>
<p>Recently, the Pudong Fellow Villagers Association, in view of the doubling of tuition fees in schools at all levels, was initiated by directors Chen Zixin and Pan Zhiwen to provide scholarships for poor children. It is tentatively set at three university students, five high school students, ten junior high school students, and twenty elementary school students. All fellow villagers who are studying in Shanghai, whose academic performance is above 70 points, and whose family is poor, can first obtain a recommendation letter from the school they are attending and a fellow villager guarantee letter. From August 1st to September 10th, they can go to apply. In addition, Chen and Pan have also formed a scholarship committee for poor children in their hometowns of Yangsi and Yangjing in the two districts, and have sent investigation forms to various schools for completion and submission to the association's office, so that staff can be sent to the countryside for practical interviews, in order to be practical and not waste money. It is truly a great gospel for poor children.</p>
<h3>Nanyang Used Bookstore Service</h3>
<p>Recently, the price of books has soared, and it is difficult for general poor students to buy books. The colleagues of the Nanyang Used Bookstore Service, in view of this, have specially invited several university students to use the summer vacation to organize a used bookstore service (address: No. 18, Longcun, Intersection of Huanlong Road and Ladu Road). The service measures are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>For those who entrust the society to sell books on their behalf, the price is determined by the seller (but it cannot exceed the general market price). After the sale, the society will charge one-tenth as a handling fee.</p>
<p>Types of books sold on behalf of: university and middle school textbooks and all other reference books.</p>
<p>Service hours: from July 15th to the end of September, 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM every day, closed on Sundays.</p>
<p>All handling fees will be used as scholarships.</p>
<h3>Teacher's Grain Allocation</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of grain allocation for municipal schools, the Grain Bureau provides special allocations of rice for teachers and students. Each month, the principals go to the Grain Bureau to collect the rice, sometimes one or two bags, sometimes three or five. However, I have been working at the school for several years now, and I have heard about this allocation countless times, but in reality, I have never received any rice.</p>
<p>Therefore, I hope that the authorities, when making the special monthly rice allocation, will do so in a manner similar to that for the general public, stating that schools such as [names of schools] should come to the bureau to collect the rice. This would prevent the rice from being resold, and we, the poor teachers, would have rice to eat. We would be truly grateful. (A Teacher)</p>
<p>United Voluntary Night School News: The alumni association of Yongjie Elementary School on East Changzhi Road, in light of the recent increase in school fees and the large number of students dropping out of school, has jointly established a voluntary night school with the school, named the United Voluntary Night School. Utilizing vacant classrooms, the school provides completely free education, and all impoverished out-of-school children are welcome to enroll.</p>
<p>YWCA Children's Home News: The YWCA Children's Home, which specializes in caring for homeless street children and children who are lost or abducted, will hold its anniversary celebration at 8:00 AM on July 24th at its location at 948 Changde Road, and invites all sectors to visit.</p>
<p>Lost Residence Permit: Zhang Yucai found a residence permit numbered 567979 belonging to Ni Guoxian and has submitted it to this office for collection.</p>
<h3>Navy</h3>
<p>— Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>Blood and Tears (3)</p>
<p>"It's really here..."</p>
<p>Without waiting for Lieutenant Nitta's explanation, he saw a Lü-class submarine moored on the rocky headland in the bay. The deck of the submarine, with its gangway, looked like the back of a whale. As he walked on that gangway, Ryuo thought to himself that in the past he had only looked at submarines from here, but now he was finally going inside to take a closer look. This was truly exciting.</p>
<p>Descending the iron ladder from the bridge, he only felt the heavy, stale air inside and the light from the electric lamps.</p>
<p>"Didn't expect it to be so cramped, did you!"</p>
<p>Shinobu said with a smile, but Ryuo was at a loss for words. It was not only cramped, but he had never seen such a complex and intricate "iron precision engineering." Even around the periscope in the conning tower, there were tightly coiled iron rings and pipes. Looking at the command post, it was filled with many machines that would give anyone a headache.</p>
<p>Before he had even finished looking at the torpedo room, the engine room, and the motor room, Ryuo's mind was already a bit confused. He had completely forgotten his prior knowledge about the submarine's two engines and the tanks for discharging water and air. He felt like a speck of dust hidden inside an iron machine. Perhaps it was more like being swallowed by a whale.</p>
<p>"Ah, thank you!"</p>
<p>Seeing the table and chairs in the officers' mess, he finally regained some composure and said this.</p>
<p>"It's nothing. Once you get used to it, it's just like your own home."</p>
<p>Lieutenant Nitta also came over and sat down at the table.</p>
<p>"This place is the officers' bedroom and study, as well as the mess hall and thoroughfare for all the crew. That curtained area is the captain's cabin..."</p>
<p>Ryuo looked inside and saw that there was only enough space for a mat, which was almost completely filled by a bed. What was even more surprising was that there were snake-like iron pipes crawling over the bed, and a round wheel protruding from it. If the captain turned over, that pipe would surely hit his skin.</p>
<p>"This submarine is easy to endure because it's moored and the machines are stopped."</p>
<p>Shinobu explained.</p>
<p>"Once the boat starts moving, it gets hot and smelly, and it's really unbearable!"</p>
<p>Lieutenant Nitta chimed in. Even with just the three of them in the cramped officers' mess, the smell was already quite strong.</p>
<p>"Hey, is there a shrine?"</p>
<p>Ryuo asked loudly. (122)</p>
