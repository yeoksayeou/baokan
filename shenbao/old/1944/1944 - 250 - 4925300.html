<p>星期評論</p>
<h3>讀林俊夫氏「致中國報人書」後</h3>
<p>— 陳彬龢</p>
<p>前日本朝日新聞記者林俊夫先生，最近發表了一篇「致中國報人書」，（九月號「政治月刋」，九月二日「新中國報」轉載）因爲我們正是中國報人，所以特別注意地細讀一過。我們覺得林光生所期待於中國報界的，也正是我們所隨時鞭策自己的。</p>
<p>林先生對中國報界，以一個日本記者的立塲與經騐而發出的批評，這種批評相當中肯，這是可以欣幸的。我們認爲一個人最怕不自知其缺陷，常抱自滿自足的成見，在中國報界也正是如此，如果因林先生的批評而大家互相勉勵，也許，對於中國報界的前途，會有光明的進步·不過，在林先生對中國報界的批評中，有若干地方，我們覺得有稍加解釋的必要。</p>
<p>首先，林先生認爲中國的新聞界是有派閥性的，因此不能不偏不倚地談論現實。這一點在中國新聞界的歷史上的確不可否認。但是中國也有不少並無派閥性而且反對派閥性的報紙。就以申報而言，創刋七十餘年來，在客觀上始終是不偏不黨為社會人士及文化服務。林先生說「申報站於民間報紙的立塲，特別對於有關民生問題的事象，無不加以此評」，這是對的；但說到：「在這種情形之下，所以報紙上便容易出現過激的議論」，這句話却是大可考慮的。如果說申報因爲站在民間立塲，對政治主張革新，對囤積投機主張取締，對米糧統制不合理主張改善等等建設性的議論，是「出現過激的議論」。那末，難道對政治不必主張革新，對囤積投機不必主張取締，對米糧統制不合理不必主張改善，就算不偏不倚的議論嗎？我們認爲：「站在民間立塲，傳達人民所希望的是什麼？傳達人民所需要的是什麼？」這個是我們所瞭解的報紙的使命。老實說，基於上述的使命，我們過去的議論，離開「過激」的程度尙遠，倒不如說「太低調」較爲切當吧！請林先生不客氣的批評一下，經過我們「過激」的議論以後，發生了怎樣的影響？以我們的主張，與當前的現狀比較，是不是我們的議論「太低調」呢？</p>
<p>其次，在林先生熱心的批評與要求之中，我們覺得也有解釋之必要的幾點。（一）是關於廣吿所占地位太多問題，這是中國報紙最大的缺點，但是，若干報紙完全以廣告收入，作爲報紙維持生命的泉源者，要求立刻改革，事實上有相當困難的。不過，新聞報中報在這兩年來，已經盡力縮小廣吿地位，並拒絕刋登不良廣吿。但是，我們並不忘却，還得作更進一步的努力。（二）在充實報紙內容方面，我們也知道有種種方法，也知道只依靠一家通訊社是免不了成爲「千篇一律的報紙二，但是事實上在今日環境之下，我們不用一家通訊社的電訊以外，還有什麼別的辦法？我們也曾盡力派遺各地記者，但是通信遲滯，困難重重，能採訪些什麼？能發表些什麼？這些問題似乎今日的報人所不難了解的吧？</p>
<p>我們很感謝林先生對於中國報紙記載內容方面，提供許多寳貴的意見。不過，在我們却不能忽略中國讀者的水準以及中國記載的慣例，譬如林先生所批評的開會紀錄過於冗長，談食米兼及煮法，在林先生認爲浪費篇幅，在我們認爲仍有需要。</p>
<p>最後，誠如林先生所說：「作爲社會的指導者，先驅者的報人之路是廣大的，應聽取社會上一般人的不乎，當作是自身遭遇一樣的去感受。」這幾句話着實抓住了報人的天職，不但中國的報人應該如此，日本的報人也應如此。不過，更重要的，報人僅僅有了感受還是不相干的，必須通過報人的感受，為社會上一般人的呼聲發出有力的「共鳴」，這個「共鳴」，就是所謂輿論，而就報人的能力，祗能做到共嗚的地步。至於能否因報人的共鳴，而滿足社會上一般人的呼聲，當然視乎當局的能否重視輿論與接受輿論了。試舉一例，米糧統制方法，社會上一般人認為不良，我們同業中都曾屢發共鳴，但能否改善，在乎常局的能否重視輿論與接受輿論？中國當局姑置不論，日本當局怎樣呢？我想林先生以過去報人的經騐，不無同感吧！</p>
<h3>太平洋上補給戰　日海相披瀝決意　渥賽島日守軍砲擊美驅艦</h3>
<p>東京九日中央社電　日本米內海相，七日在議會報吿戰况時，曾言及敵潛水艇最近跳　情形，並斷言將之殲滅乃日軍之吃緊問題。蓋自本年二月以來，敵軍即拚命强化西南太平洋之作戰，擴充該方面之前進基地及航空威力圈，同時更正式發動潛水艇戰，企圖切斷日軍海上交通連絡，日軍當局除毀滅敵潛艇戰術外，更須竭力維持日軍海上交通路，且須急速確實增强所有之戰力，由是可知太平洋戰局本年乃爲補給央戰之秋。按此補給戰，含有如下各意：　確實運送前綫所需兵力，　由資源地帶同內地輸入戰力資材及其他生活物資，　爲維持此等運輸及補給綫，復須增强飛機與潛艇，　各種船舶之護衛，　積極造船等項。蓋運輸補給作戰，實最廣泛之作戰，然而米內海相已披歷有必勝之方策及帝國海軍之決意矣。</p>
<p>中部太平洋日軍基地九日中央社電　馬紹爾羣島渥賽島日守軍，繼續勇猛進攻連日頑强來襲之美機羣，士氣愈益旺盛。七日晨發現美驅逐艦一艘，遂加以猛烈之砲擊，命中砲彈數枚，美艦頓形狼狽，於是夜張烟幕倉皇遁去。</p>
<p>西南太平洋日軍基地九日中央社電　七日上午，有敵四引擎大型機約六十架之編隊，來襲西里伯島美那多地區。又敵B24型，B25型，P38型等約五十架，於同日來襲巴爾邁拉島卡奧灣，當被日軍擊落B24型敵機十架，並將餘機擊退。</p>
<h3>日本臨時軍事費　追加預算案成立　首相外相闡明作戰目的</h3>
<p>東京九日中央社電日本第八十五次臨時議會第三日（九日），衆議九時二分開預算總會，首開秘密會，由政府說明外議，鶴見祐輔氏關於外交問題，牧野良三，喜多壯一郎，牛塚婉太郎，阿子島俊治田氏，關於必勝國家制度，村上等三氏對於食糧增產等緊急問題提出質問，後由小磯首相等政府各大臣逐次予以答復。又建議委員會於下午一時開會，提出言論暢達等積極之建議。一方面貴族院接獲衆議院之臨時軍事費迫加預算案後，上午十時開預算總會，石渡藏相說明提案理由，陸海大臣說明後，暫時休會，下午聽取政府說明外交問題，其後爲大河內輝耕氏之質問，三井淸一郎氏表示贊成，加以通過後，繼續開全體會議，提出臨時軍費預算案入條，委員長報吿委員會之經過，滿塲一致通過，至此，二百五十億元之臨時軍事費追加預算，在議會之第三日，即吿通過成立。在議會期中，日本國民對於完成作戰之信賴及決勝議會之決意，於此已全部表現矣。</p>
<p>答覆鶴見質問</p>
<p>東京九日中央社電　鶴見祐補氏，九日在衆院預算總會席上，曾將　明確日本與武力戰倂行目存自衛之戰爭目的，　積極展開外交攻勢兩項提出質問，當由小磯首相，重光外相分別關明日本之戰爭目的，一爲防衛之戰，二爲解放之戰，三爲確立和平之戰，　為排除獨佔制　之戰，並答辯如次：</p>
<p>小磯首相</p>
<p>美國之太平洋政策，即一貫之侵略戰爭，彼等雖佔夏威夷，菲律賓，而仍感不足，且敵視位居亞洲中部之日本，以ABCD包圍綫，一再壓迫日本，是即大東亞戰爭發生之原因，日本目古即以防衛爲根本精神，且皇祖曾一再詔吿國民，日本雖有外出征討之先例，然皆出自防衛，絕非求日本單獨之繁榮發展者，我皇祖精神，惟有使萬邦各得其所，始能實現。</p>
<p>重光外相</p>
<p>論戰爭目的，即在視戰爭之精神，此集合國民之精神，使之趨向大東亞，可能成爲對世界之偉大武器，日人均知，大東亞各民族，目下正在從事自存自衛之戰爭，甚至敵國民亦漸理解此點，美國對日本挑戰，而致引起此次太平洋戰爭，即英國亦承認日本之戰爭目的，始終爲自存自衛。日本帝國作戰旨趣，在粉碎獨佔制獨，使世界各民族各得其所，建設大東亞之目的，於大東亞宣言中，早已明確闡明五大原則者，即所以樹立大東亞戰爭必勝信念。關於</p>
<p>中國問題</p>
<p>美國現謂為援中國而戰，而其果爲援助中國乎？中國各地之美國軍事基地，即供其犧牲之好例，即謂彼等現從事殖民地戰爭，亦非過言。東亞人對此，應詳加認識，應保衛自己之邦家，美國始終以制霸世界爲目的，於此，吾更能明　認識，目下戰爭正所謂自存自衛主義及殖民地帝國主義之戰爭，彼等對重慶之所謂援助，即本此種帝國主義之野心而行者，不過爲利用手段而已。最近派赴重慶之納爾遜及哈雷，其目的仍在侵略，日本完全出予</p>
<p>與大東亞</p>
<p>各民族協力親和之心意，亳無領土之野心，就目下中國並完全自主一點觀之，即可明瞭中國須待中國人自決，今日實爲對中國人最重要之時機，願急速促其奮起。</p>
<p>朝鮮鐵路將改複路</p>
<p>東京九日中央社電　日衆議院於九日召開預算總會時，小暮氏提出質問，爲將中國，滿洲物資急送內地，增强朝鮮鐵路問題，當由小磯首相解答如次：與海上運輸相較，經由朝鮮之鐵路運輸，現已加强，目下朝鮮鐵路之運輸量六分之一，爲向內地運輸者，惟朝鮮鐵路之一部尙爲單綫，欲更加强運輸力，必將朝鮮鐵路全部改爲複綫，故最近已決定將奉天以南之南滿鐵路施設之一部移往朝鮮。</p>
<p>雲南怒江戰線日軍力增强</p>
<p>渝遠征軍攻勢被過阻</p>
<p>怒江九日中央社電　渝方雲南遠征軍活躍怒江兩岸，自以兵力雄厚，配置精良，盲信可以打開來多公路，五月初以來，即將騰越，龍陵各要衝包圍，迄今四月餘，爲日軍之奮戰與堅固之防衛所阻，徒受損害，毫無進展。最近日軍獲得增援，首對包圍龍陵之渝第十一集團軍，開始攻擊，刻已突破包圍網之一部，各該要衝之日軍，均對美軍指揮督戰下渝軍攻勢迎頭痛擊，不分晝夜，繼續激戰，如於孟多地方之日軍寡兵死守，彈藥不足時，則與頑强之敵軍展開壯烈之白刃戰，始終保守防地。守備騰越之日軍，則在敵熾烈之砲火攻擊下，固守孤城，帶戰二月餘。又龍陵地區之敵軍五師，自七月七日以來，傾其總力，企圖奪回龍陵，但在日軍之猛烈抵抗下，死亡枕藉，奪圓龍陵之希望終成畫餅，日軍在怒江戰綫之作戰，質負有極大之任務。渝軍此次之攻勢，以廣大之空中補給綫爲主，仰賴渝美空軍之空中補給，然由於。空軍勇猛奮戰，渝美空軍損失過多，邇來怒江戰綫重慶軍之補給，已步入困難之途，攻擊力亦日形衰頹，目下日軍兵力則日漸增强，轉取攻勢，故雲南遠征軍之動搖，僅爲時間問題</p>
<p>江前綫九日中央　　　龍陵周圍之渝軍十一集團軍，以第七十六，第九，第三十三，第二十三等師各主力，自一日來對小松山之日軍盲目攻擊，該地日軍依然確保陣地，並奪取能陵南側一重要高地，目下繼續猛攻其他一高地之逾軍中。</p>
<p>開封彰德附近日邀擊美機</p>
<p>墜毀其十六架</p>
<p>日軍某基地九日中央社電　八日下午駐渝美空軍曾以B29型機為主力，空襲滿洲之鞍山，本溪湖，被日軍擊落三架，緣日機隊於該日下午零時八分，在河南開封附近上空，追擊美B29型機之編隊約三十分之久，擊毀其八架，內中四架着火，向南方遁去。又待美機轟炸歸來，實行邀擊之日機隊，亦曾於河南省彰德附近上空邀擊B29型機羣，擊落其三架（內有一架未證實），擊毀一架，日方無捐失。茲復判明日軍職果，擊落六架（內有一架未證實），擊破十架（內四架着火），計擊落擊毀十六架。</p>
<p>日軍進攻桂省佔領東安新寗</p>
<p>日航空部隊急襲寳慶</p>
<p>漢口九日中央社電　據湖南前綫日軍基地訊，日軍精銳部隊向廣西省境猛進，於七日完全佔領零陵城，另一部隊，並與之呼應，攻陷零陵西方三十五里之廣西省境附近要衝東安，並突破湘桂省境之山脈，擊潰當地渝軍，於八日上午佔領零陵西方七十公里之要衝新寗，故日軍之突破省境已爲時間問題。</p>
<p>日軍前機某基地九日中央社電　活躍於湖南第一綫之日航空部隊，七日拂曉急襲實慶，炸毀市內軍事設施及機場設施。又同日下午一時許，於零陵附近上空，擊落渝B－25型機一架。</p>
<p>美機侵襲新鄕等地</p>
<p>北平九日中央社電　華北日軍當局於八日九時發表：　八日有美轟炸機約八十餘架，經過華北飛往滿洲，確認共飛返者約有四十六架。　有美B-25型機若干架，於八日來襲新鄕·鄭州·德縣·等地，炸傷中日二國人民各十餘人，兵房數棟被炸毀，日方擊落並擊毀B-29型機各一架。</p>
<p>渝機在粵投下傳單</p>
<p>廣州九日中央社電　近日渝機無差別轟炸廣州地區，民衆損失甚重，因之極爲憤怒，七日轟炸廣州西關時，投下傳單頗多，具名爲「中國空軍一第四大隊」，乃一吿和平地區民衆書，內容顯示渝空軍對美空軍之忿懣。其言曰：和平地區同胞們，自美國在華空軍設立以來，空軍之指揮權完全握在美空軍之手，他們總主張轟炸廣州市街，我們雖幾次反對，亦無效果，因此不得已在市內投彈，不免危害同胞們的生命財產，那要諸位原諒。</p>
<h3>中樞舉行　參戰紀念式</h3>

<h3>世界最小國　聖瑪里諾重申中立</h3>
<p>米蘭九日中央社電　海通社　：世界最少共和國聖瑪里諾（San　Marino）頃復重申嚴守中立，此項文吿，係於反軸心軍在亞得里亞沿海迫近該國時發表。按該小共和國人口僅二萬人，八百公尺之蒂達諾山在其境內，該山位於貝薩洛與拉文諾之問，故爲控制波平原之要道，雖有此戰略上之優勢，但德軍仍尊重其主權。</p>

<h3>管理金融機關　暫行辦法修正　經中央政治會議通過</h3>
<p>南京九日中央社電　財政部管理金融機關暫行辦法修正條文，業經第一三八次中政會通過，其施行　則，修正銀行註冊章程，亦已准備案，此後金融機關之管理，因此次辦法及施行細則之修正，將更强化，於金融體制之强化及安定上，亦必有極大之貢獻也。茲錄誌如下：</p>
<p>財政部管理金融機關暫行辦法修正條文：</p>
<p>增第四條，凡金融機關分設營業處所，應將原領營業執照攝成影片，並備具呈文，載明左列事項，呈請財政部核准註冊：　名稱，　劃撥資本數額，　營業處所所在地，　營菜範圍，　營業計劃書，　營業期限，　負責人姓名佳所，　凡已經開始營業之營業處所，應自本辦法施行之日起，於一個月先備共呈文，載明前項第一二三四六七各文事項，並添貝該處所最近月計表，及抄附核准設立之批示，呈請財政部補行註冊。（理由）金融機關之分設營業處所關係地方金融甚鉅，其重要不減於金融機關本身，本部對於核准上項營業處所之分設，向極審愼，須由部批准備案，方准營業。其未育此項批示者，即屬擅自設立，日可執法以繩。惟此項批示，究不若金融機關本身之營業執照，可以懸掛顯明處，爲衆目所共覩。是以營業處所之未經呈部核准，擅自分設者外，尤不易得知，無人檢舉，本部事務殷繁，耳目難過，亦無從予以取締。上海地方情形複雜，此項情事尤多，爲懲前恐後計，向有核准設立之金融機關營業處所，實有發給營業執照之必要，故擬增訂本條文，傳收整飭之效。原第四條改爲第五條（餘遞改）。</p>
<p>原第四條第五款原文，五，營業處所之設置，營業處所階級或地址之變更。（修正文）五，營業處所階級或地址之變更及其廢止。（理由）本款修正要點，爲删去（營業處所之設置）七字，金融機關營業處所旣擬規定須領營業執照，此七字自應刪去，以免重複。</p>
<p>原第五條原文金融機關每屆營業年度終了後，應於三個月內編製營業報吿書，資產負債表，財產目錄，及損益計算書，呈報財政部。（修正文）金融機關每屆營業年度終了後，應於三個月內，編製營業報吿書，資產負債表，財立目錄，損益計算書，及盈餘分配表，呈報財政部，前項資產負債表，損益計算書，盈餘分配表應公吿之。（理由）金融機關爲援受信用機關，其資財狀况損益情形，及盈餘分配數額，自應公吿，俾衆週知，公司法內已有規定，本條擬再加增訂，以示重視。（未完）</p>
<h3>美軍對列日城　展開鉗形攻勢　德西部國境佈新防綫</h3>
<p>柏林九日中央社電　海通社訊：德軍西綫防撈完成極其迅　，但此係自苦戰中得之。布洛業與加來要塞內之德守軍，現正力阻反軸心軍進入海峽各港。她軍自被突入安特衛普之英軍迫至沿海一帶後，現正向些耳德河口進行　　運動，加拿大第一軍自南面　伊普爾向東南迫進中。根特（Gnent）地方之立士（Lys）橋激戰甚烈，前夜仍在德軍手中。前日反軸心軍復圖在安特衛普南面强渡亞爾培運河未逞，英　二軍主力現在安特衛普，羅文綫東面與東北區內，向安特衛普與哈塞爾（Hasselt）間之亞爾培運河灣大施進攻，但亦未獲渡過該河，激戰現在相持中。美第一軍則自那墨爾（Namur）區東進，分二路突入列日城之北區與南區，似係一種鉗形運動，以圖奪此要寒。反軸心軍旣欲以列日·安特衛普區為戰事　甲心，至其目標則顯欲文人北白拉龐特（Brabant）同尼維根（Nynwegcn推進或突入亞探（Aachcn）盆地。</p>
<p>德軍新銳開赴前綫</p>
<p>柏林九日中央社電　海通社訊：根　德國總力動員統監郭　爾之　劃，所成立之新軍中，包括專門應付坦克軍之部隊，該隊　有最新式短距離作戰武器之配備，其兵員僅為自十七歲至三十九歲之志願者。據德軍某司令吿戰地記者烏里煦稱：　統率配備精良之師團開赴前綫，深爲快慰，其中着干最新式之武器，為以前所未見者。此項新軍自組成起至開赴前綫之過程，極為迅速，實開軍事史上之創舉。</p>

<p>市　淸局　謀抑制物價高漲，安定民生起見，特於昨日下午二時，在該局禮堂，召集全市八十　工商同業公會代表，舉行談話會。到會參加代表共五十餘單位、山徐局長報臨訓話，首　當前本市物價，句日來突然高漲，影響民生殊匪淸鮮，此嚴重問題，希望各同業公會會員，必須認淸環境，一致擁護國策，安定民生為前提，並特別提出三項問題，加以闡述：</p>
<p>物價問題　首對</p>
<p>牛年以來木市物價，認爲八月間之物價高漲，一般商人雖藉口原料缺乏，交通受阻，但根據一般貨物，其突行抬高價格，確爲非法舉動，尤其肉類蔬菜兩項，其來一源地區，皆在本市郊外，故認該兩項貨物漲價，不獨不顧商人道德，抑且擾亂商業標準，故希本市商人，務必各目就其本位，確定治理價格，隨時呈報本局，勿再乘機抬價損人利己。</p>
<p>關於工商登記</p>
<p>該局以本市市政己吿統一，故為統一工商管理起見，奉命舉辦工商登記，乃者自開始以來，迄今據統計所知，本市尙未登記之工商業，竟有十萬餘家，對於統制經濟工作，妨礙進行，實深遺憾，爲體恤商艱起見，曾一再展期，希各同業會員，勿再忽視本身利益，深盼遵守法令。</p>
<p>連絡問題　管理工商，因行政機構改組，故該局與本市工商界，實難保持運繫，且本市工商發達，無從於短時間傳達公文，今後爲求實達政府與商民感情起見，擬按月舉行全市工商界聚餐大會，藉以隨時聽取商情，提供市政當局，設法籌謀解決困難問題。徐氏訓話畢，旋即由同業公會代表報吿商情及種種困難問題，希望政府協助，打開目前工商各業感受之處境。</p>

<h3>小笠原羣島秘話</h3>
<p>— 竹下源之介</p>
<p>]</p>
<p>小笠原羣島的發見</p>
<p>美軍會大胆襲小笠原羣島的父島，這兩個島嶼是日本本部南方的要衝，在行政上屬於東京部。英美在過去曾企圖佔領小笠原羣島，唯未成功，茲將這件秘聞公開</p>
<p>明治八年（一八七五年）十一月二十一日，有一隻汽船駛出橫濱港，一路向南方疾駛。它有兩枝桅杆，二層甲板，船體是純白色的，一望就知道是明治丸（一千零三十八噸）。它是日本工部省所定造，於是年二月剛從英國駛回的燈台巡迴船，爲日本當時最新式的優秀船。</p>
<p>但今日這隻船上却沒有一個燈台局的人員，常然也不是巡行燈台，它是另有任務的。在它上面，是海軍·內務。外務·大藏各省所派許多稱爲「小笠原羣島收回委員」的官吏，如外務四等出仕田邊太一，海軍大尉根津勢吉，租稅權助林正明，地理寮七等出仕小花作助等等，此外還有隨員若干。他們的目的地，不消說，便是小笠原羣島。</p>
<p>所謂小笠原羣島，據傳是信州深志（松本）的城主小笠原長時之曾孫小笠原貞賴在這樣二年（一五九三年）發見的，　賴得到德川家康的許可，曾在島上樹立未標，上面寫着：</p>
<p>「日本國天照皇大神宮地島長源家康分慕下小笠原四位少將民部少輔源貞賴朝臣」（原文）</p>
<p>由此可知小笠原羣島完全是日本的土地。然則此時爲何特派官史前往收回這個本爲日本領土小笠原羣島呢？</p>
<p>原來該島經小笠原貞賴佔領而開拓以後，不久即因海道困難，再加施行寬永鎖國令等等原因，不知在什麼時候此島竟成爲人跡全無的荒島，世人因它位於日本本土的巽方（即南方），遂稱它爲「巽無人島」除出偶爾有遇難船的餘生者提及該島所在以外，簡直被人造忘掉了</p>
<p>英美互爭太平洋島與</p>
<p>在這其間，英美等海盜化的捕鯨船及探險船却時時窺伺該島。那時，他們正在太平洋上攘奪殖民地，四出爭取，甚至出沒於日本本土附近。文政六年（一八二三年），美國捕鯨船駛抵母島，自以爲他們是此島最初的發見者，因以船長可芬之名名之，稱它爲可芬島。二年以後的文政八年（一八二五年），英國的捕鯨船抵達父島，也同樣以爲是他們發見的。文政十年（一八二七年），英國政府更派測量船到該處，定名爲泌爾羣島，於父島字洲崎的一株樹上釘了一牌銅牌·　起了英國旗，</p>
<p>美國得　　事以後，認爲英國的佔領那些島嶼十分不該，於嘉永六年（一八五三年）貝里來領艦隊到浦賀時，打算趁機奪取該島。七月間，貝里親赴父島二見港，於扇浦振分山上懸起美國旗。繼於十月中派遣其麾下的軍艦普勒茅斯號艦長寇里往該島。寇里在母島登陸後，立即將泌爾島改稱可芬羣島，於母鳥冲村西北　的一棵樹上釘了一塊銅牌。同時慫恿從夏威夷方面移住此島的英美人民組織類似殖民地臨時政府的機關；這也是出於貝里之意。</p>
<p>當日本得悉英美互相爭奪文祿年間以來即爲日本領土的小笠原羣島時，就是無這的幕府也不肯捨棄它，乃於文久元年（一八六一年）十二月派遣外國奉行水野忠德及且附服部歸一等乘軍艦咸臨丸至小笠原。水野等抵達父島以後，當即召集歸化的島民等，吿以此島係日本的領土，　斗　以開拓。遂於　　幸　　大紳宮，設臨時游事處，　　開拓碑，上題；「小笠原新建之記」。同時係舟小花作助爲島可，從入丈方面送去移民四十餘人、着千開拓。</p>
<p>但不久維新的　　　起，官更和移民一時都回到日本內地去，開拓工作亦半途而廢、於是英美再　隙爭　此島。及至　治八年（一八七五年），有一個呌做彼斯的美人稱　於小笠原羣島，鬧得中外皆知。當時，自日本維新以來即以傲優無禮的外交官著聞於世的英國公使巴克斯，向“本外務當局責問道：「小笠原羣島究係貴國領土，仰英美領土？」蓋老奸巨滑的巴克斯打算看日本如何回答而想提出小笠原羣島從前是英國先佔有的口實。但日方的回答極其明白：「絕對是日本領土。從今日起立刻冉事開拓！」</p>
<p>這樣，便急遽派遣小笠原羣島收回委員一行搭乘明治丸前往該島。</p>
<p>英國軍艦遲了一步</p>
<p>英國公使巴克斯得悉日本政府已急派明治丸前往小笠原羣島，不覺失色，於第二日（十一月二十二）急令英國領事洛勃脫遜及海軍武官等，搭乘碇泊　　的英國軍艦卡里烏號，追　明治丸之後。自從得到日本當局的答覆以後，佔領小笠原羣島的野心本已碎了一半，但心猶未死的巴克斯知　日本必有收　小笠原羣島之舉，尙圖產制日方派遣宮一行的行動。</p>
<p>可是，日方也料到這各事情，所以嚴令明治丸船長英人希托爾斯不許在預定的中途寄港地三宅，入丈　島靠岸，一路直駛小笠原軍島。明治丸的平均勞為每小時十一節半，在當時要算很快速了。結果，明治丸於二十四日駛入父島二見港，這比預定日期早了兩大。</p>
<p>靠岸後，派遣官一行立即在船上召集島上歸化者，嚴論從此以後日本決再經營全島；同時調查島民等的戶籍，並將開拓所必要的器眞等供給們。結果，他們欣然奉命，普在日本帝國的保護下從事開拓。據那時的戶籌調查，島上的人全爲歸化的外國人，共有十四戶七十一名。</p>
<p>却說遲了一日駛出橫濱的英艦卡里烏號，曾與明治丸船長希托爾斯暗通聲氣，得悉明治丸途中要在三宅，八丈兩島碇泊，所以預定二十六日兩船同時馳抵父島，不料明治丸爲上述那樣變更預定的行程，全速疾駛，直指父島，避却卡里烏號，因此卡里爲號比明治丸遲了兩天，在二十六日始現於二見港。它到得太遲了，日方的派道官此時口將收回小笠原羣島的事宜辦完了。</p>
<p>英國領事洛勃脫遜未免懊喪之至，但狡猾的紳工國人是喜怒不形於色的，他殲過了失望之色，製成一絡大派的樣子，對日本派遣官說：</p>
<p>「貴國此次收回之舉，迅捷成功，謹致賀意。余來此島，係諷巴克斯公使閣下之旨，僅在糾正島民美人彼斯所作所爲者，此外別無他意。英國政府亦認為茍於保護島上英人之目的下領有此島，則不得不一併保護住於此島附近各島之英人，爲避免麻煩計，莫若棄之。因此之故，今日此羣島歸於貴國管理，我等並無異議。」</p>
<p>他在島上勾留數日後，便悄悄歸返橫濱。滯留父島時，偶然得知往年（即日本文政十年公元一八二七年）英人釘於父島字洲崎樹上的銅將爲歸化島民所藏，乃要來帶回去。他除出給巴克斯帶回這件禮物以外，大約沒有第二件東西。</p>
<p>經略南方的志士小花作助</p>
<p>這樣，日本本部的南門總算在千鈞一髮的當兒重歸日本的版圖，同年中議決開拓全島，作爲內務省的直轄地，翌年，一八七六年，收回委員之一的小花作助，被任爲內務權少丞，奉命率領屬僚十餘人前往該島赴任。明治十年（一八七七年）於父島扇浦置內務省出張所，掌理全島行政。道位小笠原羣島的第一代島司小花作助，如前所述，從幕府時一代起便從事開墾該島，在南方經營上是獨具一家之一見的志士。</p>
<p>他在文久元年隨外國諷行永野忠德前往該島，迨命留駐該島時，知道距該島之南二百餘里有巴離島等無人荒島（即馬里亞納羣島北部各島嶼），乃與同忠松本三之丞等向幕府建議，說明探查經營這些島嶼，可與小笠原羣島一同作爲日本南進的立脚點。明洽以來，他爲了收回小笠原羣島，對於要道捷徑，熱心策畫，終於收復該羣島。</p>
<p>明治十年十一月他任島司時代，於父島納凉山建立小笠原羣島開拓之碑，碑文係參議大久保利通所撰，其文中有「伊豆之一山脈婉蜒起伏，至此而盡，乃我南門也。」小花作助見到後，馬上把「而盡」兩字鑿去。島吏不知，大紫毀壞這兩個字的犯人。小花得悉，遂對他說明，吿訴他「而盡」兩字是多餘的，因爲小笠原羣島是日本經略南方的門戶，決不應該就此「而盡」，所以故意將它削去。島吏聽了，非常佩服他的見解。像這樣預最希望日本南方的門戶不盡於小笠原羣島一帶，將來將更向南方伸展，正表現出他經營南方的志氣是躍如的。（譯自七月二十三日週刋朝日）</p>

<h3>戲水</h3>
<p>— 人人</p>
<p>是該秋凉的時候，空氣裏老是綴滿熱，悶，煩燥；夏之火燄仍舊遺留着，燃燒着每一個都市人的心。</p>
<p>前幾天垃圾橋一段的蘇州河畔有十幾個野孩子，在傍晚的陽光中浴着蘇州河裏黑汚的水，一個個喜喇喇地撥水相戲，水淥淥地從河裏爬起來，再從岸上，橋　干上躍下，「撲通」一聲打成河面一個窟洞；一個　着一個的滑稽而醜相的雙人泳，投一塊石子沉入河底，一個個續入水內爭尋這塊石子的遊戲……熱鬧，活躍，透露了童稚又天眞的喜悅，都市的人士是好奇的，從游泳池裏看厭了那種慢條厮理的文腔，再看到這凝野孩子的潑野，粗綫絛作風，宛如開了眼界般的驚奇，觸着不可言喩的興趣，於是岸畔，橋欄邊排列着一行行地行人，他們都是純為孩子們戲水的誘惑而暫時駐足的，他們認眞的看着，欣賞着，但他們看的欣賞的心理是畸形的，他們有時臉上鼓起一陣笑，甚而舞手鼓掌，道猶如看馬戲班裏一對海豹玩球引起的笑樂一樣。</p>
<p>「喂！喂……」一位紳士型的用手揮着對水裏的孩子們說，同時用另一隻手指着橋欄的最高處繼着道：「從這裏跳下去，從這裏跳下去，我給他一百元……」這位紳士驕傲的又將袋內的一張百元票摸出來揚一揚，因利的誘惑一位瘦弱的孩子終於嘗試了，於是博得一班人的嘖嘖贊賞，附着另一班人不相干的哈哈。可是大家都忘掉　河面有一丈多高躍下去孩的的危險性，或者說孩子生命的價値僅抵過一張百元鈔，更可設他們忘記這是同類，水裏的岸上的分別竟劃出這樣隔膜了人類的界限——乖離人性的駭人的界限。</p>
<p>我天天在穌州河畔　　，看到兩岸巍巍地文明建築物，來住的摩托車等，同時河　艦機出　氣力的苦役，河上十八世紀式的蓬棚船等，深深感觸到都市間充塞着矛盾與不調和性；現在又看到戲水的孩子，和看戲水孩子的一幕活劇，更覺這是人問充塞了矛盾與不調和性的。兒童是天眞的，樂天的，他們戲水時的潑野，喜悅，一股頑皮相，時時拉回了我童年的夢。但每次我在傍晚從治事的地方回來有到他們時常常引起一點莫名的感慨我實在也疑惑它是那裏生出來的。「他們都是中國的兒童。」我這樣想。「他們都是有希望的，都是明日國家的梁棟，社會的砥柱。」我又這慶進一層的去設想。但是他們每天過的生活是打拾的，流浪的，沒有管敎的；一天的生活對塡飽他們　子的責任都不敢確定，一片布末，一小段香烟頭各種事物！是他們工作的目標，生活的對像；他們需要的實是人問的　餘，他們的生活就建染在這些天問的睡餘上－自然即使最低最小的生存慾也是不够的，於是他們的目光轉移到從倉庫裏出來的裝貨卡車上，貨車上擠滿一袋袋的米毅豆麥之類、都是人類必需的糧食，卡車如疆塲上的馬，一匹一匹的奔馳過去，流落在車後的一些雜糧的餘粒，這羣孩子就爭呀奪的拾着，搶着向自己的口袋裏裝。有時趁一個機會，沒有路警的時候，就一窠　奔在貨車後面，幾個頑强的吊在車屁股上，用他們的手，或者硬器戳破一個麻袋的一角，就讓裏邊的米粒，黃豆等溜瀉出來，於是大家滿意的爭拾着，喜悅的競搶着。一天，我親見一個汚臉的女孩子，　在卡車的左側，一手擋着上而看管人竹竿的鞭韃，一手儘量在一隻麻袋口裏挖出一大把一大把的山芋乾向空拋着，似雨點般的落在地上，她從忍受袋上面人的鞭打，和毒駡，換得的是車後一羣孩子拾山芋乾充飢的喜悅。看到這種類乎有計劃的刦掠，我實在佩服他們的果敢，聰明，有毅力，有忍耐；雖然他們用法是誤入了歧途的，但是爲了「生「和「活」，又有什麼可以批評的呢？</p>
<p>現在這羣野孩了在戲水時候的活躍，嬉笑，甚之說他的智慧，本質實在和其他人家的子弟沒有什麼不相及的地方。我可以重複的說一句：「他們同樣是中國的兒童，而且都是有希望的。」可是因他（她）們生在人間最貧迫最不幸的人家，只得遇着生活陰暗的另一面。給社會　棄着，成爲人問的贅　，廢材，宛如垃圾一樣，他們算不得是一個八，不能過着人類最低慾望要求的生活，更不能有最低限度敎育的享受，整天在馬路上閒蕩，流浪，爲了生活，爲了飢渴，他們的一生就這樣的完了。</p>
<h3>缺陷之美</h3>
<p>— 維新</p>
<p>廚川白村以爲「缺陷之美」就是所謂美人的　子之類。誠然，沒有醜，那能　托出美來？西施有了心病，這是缺陷，但因更而顯得出她的美來。平靜的海洋起了巨大的波濤，這是缺陷，但因而更顯得它的雄偉。同樣，塞翁失馬，焉知非福？又若攀過層　壘岡後，得到少許的休息，較長在家中默坐的快樂，何者爲勝，也就很明白了吧！</p>
<p>人生的路是崎嶇不平的；理伏了許多缺陷，所以要求滿足，須從缺陷中得之。希望和慾望無窮盡，於是，「人生」才是個走不完的旅途了！</p>
<p>人類有個走不完的旅途，但是也在不停地進化着。人類之所以求進化，就是爲要不斷的來滿足其缺陷；但也不息地創造了新的缺陷。這些都是人類之所以為人類，而　然與禽獸不同之處了。如此，世界上才會有甦醒蓬勃的生趣。</p>
<p>假使，大家都像禽獸一股，祗是俄了就吃，倦了就睡，旣無所謂缺陷，也無所謂滿足。那麽，世界成了何等狀況？豈不是一個冷冰的廢墟了嗎？</p>
<p>黃老之學的俗語如：「樹高千丈，葉落歸根」，「大事化小，小事化無」；「出門一里，勿及屋裏」等，都是平淡無一奇，日薄　　的，那「缺陷少美」根本是不知的了！</p>
<p>老子的理想是使人返於順手自然的嬰兒狀態。他的主張要絕望　習，小國寡民。爲什麽？他說：「大道廢，有仁義，智慧出，有大僞；六親不和，有孝慈；國家昏亂，有忠臣。」他是一個消極的絕慾主義者。他的學說，是退化的，不合進化的原則。若是人類果眞仍舊回到原始的嬰兒狀態：那又何貴乎爲人類，「大道廢」，「有大僞」，「六親不和」，「國家昏亂」都是缺陷。反之，「智慧出」，「有仁義」，「有孝慈」，「有忠臣都」是進化。這是有缺陷　有進化。</p>
<p>「人生」是個走不完的旅途：事實上，除了我們的心所憧憬着的上帝及天國以外，再也沒有無缺陷的人及無缺陷的世界了。如此，人類　有進化；世界上　有生趣。「缺陷之美」眞是何等億大的呵</p>
<p>我們現在處於個人缺陷，社會缺陷；國家缺陷最深的時代。換句話說，就是我們站在最有生趣的社會裏。如果我們努力不怠地奮鬥，必能得到最大的滿足。但一般「願爲治世狗；不作亂時人」的人，便不能領略這時代的生趣。原因是十分簡單的，就是他們不懂得「缺陷之美」的意義。</p>
<p>叔本華尼采之流，認爲世界是萬惡的，所以說人生是個「悲劇」。李白說：「處世若大夢，胡爲勞其生」；古人說：「　網瀰大，跳出一網，又入一網」，這些都是厭惡人生，我耍反對！不！正因爲世界上是有缺陷，所以人生　能取得眞趣。人生簡直是個「喜劇」啊！至於一般不懂得「缺陷之美」的人，是不是與道的，因爲他們原是不認識人生的眞義啊！</p>
<h3>老校長</h3>
<p>— 凌祖仁</p>
<p>放下了「樂育英才」的担子，而躍進了陌生的工業圈子。</p>
<p>從前中學時期的「老校長」，已放下了「樂育英才」的担子，而躍進了陌生的工業圈子：——開始做了我們無錫分廠的「廠務主任」。</p>
<p>從前眼睛裏朝夕接觸的是粉筆，紅墨水，點名册，敎職員的淸瘦的臉，和幼稚而帶天眞的學生……在却換來了紗錠，布機和各種各樣的呢布，接觸的人物，也換上了一些粗野或黃瘦的男女工人，和各階層的同人……</p>
<p>從「學」到「工」，環境已改換得不同，周遭的事物，也完全變了質和型。</p>
<p>昔日耳官裏所滿的充聲音，是學生們高朗的讀書聲和歌唱聲，現在却紙有一些單關而重濁的機構的原動聲了。</p>
<p>對於這，我們的老校長想來也不無悵觸吧！</p>
<p>記得自從我踏出了校門以後，就從沒有再見過他，直到最近，方始在上海的廠裏，重新看見了他。</p>
<p>仍是那高高和胖胖的個子，微禿的頭頂，慈祥的笑容……雖然這些東西，和我　隔了已有好幾年，但覺得它們仍舊保持那不變的原狀，不過，時間却也是最容不得人的，因此，在老校長的臉上，也不難我出一絲從前所沒有的蒼老，膚色也似乎比從前　黑了一些，精神倒却仍是那末的　　。</p>
<p>當時，我見了他，也招呼過了他，但却不知怎的，竟鼓不起勇氣來同他去談一些話，我祗是默默地坐辦公室的一角，偷偷地瞧着那熟悉的他的慈祥的面容，和靜靜地聽着那從他嘴角邊流出來的安祥的話語，——時他正周旋在一些上級同仁的包圍裏——，從他那安祥的談叱裏，我立刻想起了在讀書時代的週會上的他的動人的演說。</p>
<p>現在在我的面前的，仍是那一個人，說話的也仍是那一張嘴，但是；時間是決不會倒流的！現在的一切都和從前改了樣，而前的「老校長」已決不是從前的「老校長」了，也正同於在他而前的一個曾受過他敎誨的學生而已不是從前的學生了一般。</p>
<p>現在的「老校長」的話題，也已從「大代數」和「理化」上，轉到了四十二支雙股，「身骨」，「原料」，和「生意經絡」……上，我覺得我的心，給一種莫名其妙的情感在絲纏着，是悲哀？歡樂？茫然的也很難分析。</p>
<p>「老校長」也像普通的人一樣地談到了「生活」，從他那微皺的眉頭裏，我看淸楚了「生活過人」的陰影，已普遍地籠眾住了各階層的人。</p>
<p>有過幾次，他的目光和我正在注視着他的目光起了交糾，我感覺周身微微地有些震撼，立刻把我的目光避開了，很像從前在讀書時期中，被他揭穿了秘寗時一樣；但是，現在的他，是再也不會來責罰我的了！</p>
<p>我暫時閉起限，默默地在追念着讀書時代的一切，那些過去的陳跡，雖已　經烟般的飄忽，但；在回憶裏緩緩地蘇鰻過來，還是有着一層淡淡的親切的意味。</p>
<p>禁不住內心的慫恿，我又張開了眼睛。深深地看了他一眼，他仍是安詳地坐着，一件灰呢的長袍，裹住了他那僕僕風塵的身心，不知現時的他，還有沒有費前那時穿了短衣，在運動塲上跟我們爭奪足球錦標的興緻了不！</p>
<p>他曾又看過了我幾次，我想：他已記不起我這探的一　淘氣的學生了吧！是的！但是，一個記憶力很強的人，也難於記作成千的學生，不過：成千的學生，却絕對的會都記住着了。——我當然也是其中之一。</p>
<p>幾次，想鼓起勇氣立見身來，跑近他的身邊，同他單獨的去談一些親切的話，但是，我的「平凡」，却壓制了我，我不想把我的「平凡」去引起他的失望，還是讓他不記住我的好！</p>
<p>之後，雖然他在上海的廠裏，很住了一陣子，但是，我却一直沒有找他去談過話，我把自己一直隱藏在「平淡」裏。</p>
<p>現在，他又回到無錫分廠服務去了，當然他是沒法　見道一篇他的一個「平凡」的學生所寫的「平凡」的文章的！我祗得在篇末默默地祝福着這位慈祥的「老校長」永健！</p>

<h3>評壘球三强技術　熊貓勝海賊後今晨戰西靑</h3>
<p>全滬壘球聯賽開始以來，業已二月，各隊强弱已見分明。現對冠軍之爭奪有資格者僅三隊，即華人勁旅熊貓（Pandsa），及西靑（Y　Cnbs），葡商紅（Lusitano　Reds）是也。餘如菲僑甲及海賊均敗二次。在上週日，（九月三日）熊貓以四比零力克海賊。在是役中，熊貓各員恢復常態，不過擊球方面仍未見進步。</p>
<p>今晨（十日）十時三刻，熊貓將逢聯賽三强中之西靑隊於膠州公園。倘天雨地濕，球賽將展期。此戰實定奪二隊之成敗，因誰勝即有與最强之葡商紅決奪錦標之決賽權。故今日之戰，雙万必盡全力，以圖勝利。同時熊貓欲爲我華人在西人獨霸之壘球　上爭究起見，成敗亦在此一舉也。現在些三强中就最近各戰中所所得之印象，略述於次：</p>
<p>熊貓精於守壘擊球未盡人意</p>
<p>熊貓內圍守壘，在戰菲僑一役中，發揮無遺。尤以留日名手梁聲聲之游擊，最見工夫。一壘手王念祖在最近二役中，進步奇速，接球甚穩。此外投手李啓騰近來在諸役中，所投之球，其急峻幾乎凌駕葡商之湯拔拉。李君年事尙輕，倘再加努力，則全滬最佳之壘球投手，非君莫屬矣。餘外翼唐偉業及　兆森二人，俱見進步。不過最令人可惜者，乃三壘溫瑞雄及二壘溫天華均每况愈下，二君均留日名手，在諸役中未見有佳妙演出，恐疏於練習所致。在擊球方面，熊貓最令人感不滿意。無論守畾如何佳妙，若進攻無路，亦屬徒然也。聞近日領隊鄂森君及敎練旦夕在東華球塲指導各員擊球技術，故今日或許有佳妙之演出，我人試拭目以待。</p>
<p>西靑人材平均攻守俱見工夫</p>
<p>西靑麾下乃巨人籃球隊之化身。如奧柴遼，凱擴密洛夫，却利勃克等人。更有日本名將植島爲游擊手，如虎添翼，此君乃一左擊手（Leff－handbatter）堪稱虎將。不過該隊唯一弱點，乃後勁不足。若最初連敗數分，則將零亂，鬥志毫無。此在戰葡商一役中，最易看出。反之若最初勝利，則將努力到底，拚死不放。此與其籃球作風，似趨一致也。</p>
<p>葡商進攻最强防守外翼最佳</p>
<p>被稱爲全能之葡商紅隊，自獲上屆冠軍，盛氣迫人。該隊不能少之靈魂投手湯拔拉牌子。最近二戰，連得二次全壘打，葡隊之不敗，此君功勞最大。觀乎前週戰熊貓在第一局中，因其猛擊而致華隊連失致命之三分。又如上週戰菲僑一役，葡隊若無此君，冠軍早就絕望。因是戰，菲僑在第四局仍以四比零領前，至終局葡隊賴其擊球神技追成平手。至再加賽一局時，葡隊蓋恩上一壘，輪至湯拔拉擊球，此君如有神助，拚命一揮。竟得全壘打，葡隊因之而反敗爲勝，此君當英雄也。將來熊貓若能再逢此隊，此君應嚴加注意，寗願送其「自由上一壘」，不使共有球擊出也。葡隊之外翼最佳，有球必接，熊貓之敗，實此因也，惟今日嚴將爲聯誼效勞，俾奪王座，白馬爲表演</p>
<h3>小足球蓬勃　今日有精彩表演</h3>
<p>— 鄭端</p>
<p>本夏季小型足球之蓬勃，實歷年所未有，亦出乎理想之外。本各　賽早可結束。乃以連朝飄雨，以致各盃賽仍有比賽，惟均在最後關頭，頗多精彩。尤以今日在靑年聯誼社之二慕，將爲小足球之大會串。其節目爲上海小足球聯合會主辦之首屆小型球甲組總決賽，聯誼華通決奪王座，另增表演賽由東華化身之白馬隊迎戰義將變相之僑聯隊。依四隊之人馬而言，滬上第一琉足球名將，搜羅殆盡。以足球員而試小足球，當另有一番作風。况小足球本爲足球之基本，則今戰可爲一般後起者所觀摩焉。記者曾多次參觀各隊小型球之演出，略述戰術，所以送別盛極一時之首屆小型球聯賽。</p>
<p>聯誼華通作風相同</p>
<p>以上兩隊，在首屆小型球賽中，恃其隊員之經騐豐富，球藝之超然，故蹤跡所至，無不披糜，乃達於今日最後決賽。綠兩隊作量，均以刀大斧關著，故兩雄惡鬥，須視乎當時之幸運而定，說者謂聯誼人材，究高一等，勝利希望較有把握，然華通之小足球，確頗有其特殊之點，前鋒後衛能呵成一氣久，爲小足球之至高水準。况今戰劉隊長傷愈臨陣，固未必言其希望選少也。再兩隊組織人，亦遞承一家，則無異異箕荳相煎，不知前來可急？</p>
<p>白馬精壯橋聯如何</p>
<p>白馬全部淸一色東華將士，並有港來名將嚴士鑫加入戰，未必再戰，則白馬乃完全東華人馬矣。觀白馬在福華盃中戰績球迷無不贊賞。球藝旣上乘，戰術又能隨機應變，出奇制勝。今日對手爲僑聯隊，該隊在小足球中從未露臉，本領如何？從何推測。惟觀其公佈之陣棧，無不爲者名之士，且有津來二義軍參加。故余意白馬之勝，今日必須全賴傳遞神妙，細膩功夫，應用裕如，始克成功也。</p>
<p>總之，些二幕球賽，必爲一般人士所愛觀，預料靑聯球塲，將有空前少盛况，記者頗登該塲地之環境，今日勢必約三五同事，一行自由車，作郊遊之舉，及抵該塲，又屬樹木成蔭，秋意爽人，亦假日之好消遣也。</p>
<h3>體壇花絮</h3>
<p>汕隊體育會主幹林作詩受傷甚重，近在診治中，祝早占勿藥！</p>
<p>排球聯賽已全部結束，乙組錦標隊為永三隊，聞即將擇期舉行給獎典禮。此次獎品，各錦標每隊得旗一方，蓋物價飛騰，銀杯亦貴，當局不得不然耳。好在獎品仍　勵附屬而已。想各隊必不計較</p>
<h3>對於足聯會之希望</h3>
<p>— 必賢</p>
<p>上海足球聯合成立一年，在過去之一年中，其成績雖未臻十全十滿，然以一初創之機關，觀乎每次球賽時之盛况熱烈，進行順利，自可見該會提倡頗力，辦事週密。唯正因球賽之收入可觀，難免引起各界猜疑，流言所至，不無使辦事入掃興。實則該會乃公共機關，帳目歷歷可舉，何待我人嘵嘵也。酒者，金風送爽，時序入秋，足球季頭，隨之降臨。足聯會一年一度照章改組，上届總幹事周家騏君表示倦勤。周君服務體育界，有悠久歷史，成績斐然。一旦離去，殊爲惋惜！現周君辭職，業已經最高當局照准。日前該會新組織及新人選巳公佈。</p>
<p>組織方面，在常務理事下設四組：第一組爲總務，第二組爲編配，第三組爲票務，第四組爲財務，每組設正副主任各一人：</p>
<p>第一組　正主任　談　熹　副主任　沈回春</p>
<p>第二組　正主任　樂秀榮　副主任　金　遂</p>
<p>第三組　正主任　馬潤芳　副主任　楊　平</p>
<p>第四組　正主任　譚　敬　副主任　黃兆鴻</p>
<p>今組織機構，旣已刷新，各部人選又經精密遴拔，以其完整之機構以及優秀之人事，則本屆足球聯會成績之突飛孟晋，定可預卜！値此新陳代謝之際，爰誌數語，紙短情長，吾人實寄與無限殷望，即以此進呈足聯會諸君！</p>
<p>又悉，該會本季起，規定每月舉行福利賽一次，以過去球迷之踴躍情形而推測，福利事業，賴以推進也無疑。</p>

        <h1>1944 - n250</h1>
<h3>After Reading Mr. Lin Junfu's "Letter to Chinese Journalists"</h3>
<p>— Chen Binhe</p>
<p>Mr. Lin Junfu, a former reporter for the Japanese Asahi Shimbun, recently published a "Letter to Chinese Journalists" (reprinted in the September issue of "Political Monthly" and the September 2nd issue of "New China Daily"). Because we are Chinese journalists, we paid special attention to reading it carefully. We feel that what Mr. Lin Guangcheng expects from the Chinese press is exactly what we constantly urge ourselves to do.</p>
<p>Mr. Lin's criticism of the Chinese press, from the standpoint and experience of a Japanese journalist, is quite pertinent, which is gratifying. We believe that the worst thing for a person is to be unaware of their own shortcomings and to always hold complacent prejudices. This is also true in the Chinese press. If everyone encourages each other because of Mr. Lin's criticism, perhaps there will be bright progress in the future of the Chinese press. However, there are some points in Mr. Lin's criticism of the Chinese press that we feel need some explanation.</p>
<p>First of all, Mr. Lin believes that the Chinese news industry is factional, so it cannot discuss reality impartially. This is indeed undeniable in the history of the Chinese news industry. However, there are also many newspapers in China that are not factional and oppose factionalism. Taking Shen Bao as an example, for more than seventy years since its founding, it has always been objectively impartial and served the society and culture. Mr. Lin said, "Shen Bao stands on the position of a people's newspaper, and pays special attention to issues related to people's livelihoods, adding its own comments to them." This is correct; but when it comes to: "Under these circumstances, it is easy for excessive arguments to appear in the newspaper," this statement is worth considering. If it is said that Shen Bao, because it stands on the position of the people, advocates innovation in politics, advocates cracking down on hoarding and speculation, and advocates improving the unreasonable control of rice and grain, etc., is a "display of excessive arguments," then does it mean that it is impartial not to advocate innovation in politics, not to advocate cracking down on hoarding and speculation, and not to advocate improving the unreasonable control of rice and grain? We believe that: "Standing on the position of the people, conveying what the people hope for? Conveying what the people need?" This is the mission of the newspaper as we understand it. Frankly speaking, based on the above mission, our past arguments are far from "excessive," and it would be more appropriate to say that they are "too understated!" Please, Mr. Lin, criticize us frankly. After our "excessive" arguments, what kind of impact has it had? Comparing our proposals with the current situation, are our arguments "too understated"?</p>
<p>Secondly, we feel that there are also a few points in Mr. Lin's enthusiastic criticism and requests that need to be explained. (1) Regarding the problem of advertisements occupying too much space, this is the biggest shortcoming of Chinese newspapers. However, for some newspapers that rely entirely on advertising revenue as a source of sustenance, it is quite difficult to demand immediate reform. However, the news section of our newspaper has been trying its best to reduce the space occupied by advertisements and refuse to publish bad advertisements in the past two years. However, we do not forget that we still need to make further efforts. (2) In terms of enriching the content of the newspaper, we also know that there are various methods, and we also know that relying solely on one news agency will inevitably lead to "homogeneous newspapers." But in fact, in today's environment, what other choice do we have besides using the telegrams of one news agency? We have also tried our best to send reporters to various places, but communication is slow, and there are many difficulties. What can we interview? What can we publish? These questions seem easy for today's journalists to understand, right?</p>
<p>We are very grateful to Mr. Lin for providing many valuable opinions regarding the content recorded in Chinese newspapers. However, we cannot ignore the level of Chinese readers and the conventions of Chinese records. For example, Mr. Lin criticized the meeting records as being too lengthy, and talking about rice also included cooking methods. Mr. Lin believes that this is a waste of space, but we believe it is still necessary.</p>
<p>Finally, as Mr. Lin said: "As a guide and pioneer of society, the path of a journalist is broad, and they should listen to the dissatisfaction of the general public in society, and feel it as if it were their own encounter." These words truly grasp the duty of a journalist. Not only should Chinese journalists do this, but Japanese journalists should also do this. However, what is more important is that it is irrelevant for journalists to simply have feelings; they must use their feelings to issue a powerful "resonance" for the voices of the general public in society. This "resonance" is what is called public opinion. And, to the best of a journalist's ability, they can only achieve the level of resonance. As to whether the resonance of journalists can satisfy the voices of the general public in society, it depends, of course, on whether the authorities can value and accept public opinion. To give an example, the general public in society believes that the method of rice and grain control is bad, and our colleagues have repeatedly issued resonance, but whether it can be improved depends on whether the authorities can value and accept public opinion? Leaving aside the Chinese authorities, what about the Japanese authorities? I think Mr. Lin, with his past experience as a journalist, would have the same feeling!</p>
<h3>Supply War on the Pacific Ocean: Japanese Naval Minister Reveals Determination; Japanese Garrison on Wotje Island Bombards U.S. Destroyer</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) — Japanese Naval Minister Minei, when reporting on the war situation in the Diet on the 7th, mentioned the recent activities of enemy submarines, and asserted that annihilating them was a pressing issue for the Japanese military. Since February of this year, the enemy has desperately strengthened its operations in the Southwest Pacific, expanding its forward bases and air power range in that area. At the same time, it officially launched a submarine war, attempting to cut off the Japanese military's maritime communications. In addition to destroying enemy submarine tactics, the Japanese authorities must also strive to maintain the Japanese military's maritime transportation routes, and must rapidly and reliably increase all its combat capabilities. From this, it can be seen that this year's Pacific war situation is the autumn of the supply war. This supply war contains the following meanings:  Reliably transporting the troops needed on the front lines,  Importing combat materials and other living materials from resource areas and the mainland,  In order to maintain these transportation and supply lines, it is necessary to increase aircraft and submarines,  Escorting various ships,  Actively building ships, etc. Transportation and supply operations are actually the most extensive operations. However, Naval Minister Minei has revealed a sure-win strategy and the determination of the Imperial Navy.</p>
<p>Central Pacific Japanese Military Base, 9th (Central News Agency) — The Japanese garrison on Wotje Island in the Marshall Islands continues to bravely attack the U.S. aircraft formations that have stubbornly attacked it day after day, and its morale is becoming increasingly strong. On the morning of the 7th, a U.S. destroyer was discovered, and a fierce bombardment was carried out, hitting several shells. The U.S. ship was immediately embarrassed, and that night it laid down a smokescreen and fled in a panic.</p>
<p>Southwest Pacific Japanese Military Base, 9th (Central News Agency) — On the morning of the 7th, an enemy formation of about 60 large four-engine aircraft attacked the Minado area of ​​Celebes Island. Also, about 50 enemy B24, B25, and P38 aircraft attacked Kao Bay on Palmyra Island on the same day, and 10 enemy B24 aircraft were shot down by the Japanese military, and the remaining aircraft were repelled.</p>
<h3>Japanese Provisional Military Expenditure: Supplementary Budget Approved; Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Clarify War Aims</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) — On the third day (9th) of the 85th Extraordinary Diet session, the House of Representatives opened the budget general meeting at 9:02 AM. First, a closed meeting was held, where the government explained foreign affairs. Mr. Tsurumi Yusuke raised questions about diplomatic issues. Makino Ryozo, Kita Soichiro, Ushizuka Entaro, and Ajishima Shunji Tada raised questions about the essential national system. Murakami and others raised urgent questions about food production. Later, Prime Minister Koiso and other government ministers answered them one by one. The Recommendations Committee held a meeting at 1:00 PM and proposed positive suggestions such as free speech. On the other hand, after the House of Peers received the House of Representatives' supplementary budget proposal for temporary military expenditure, it opened the budget general meeting at 10:00 AM. Minister of Finance Ishiwatari explained the reasons for the proposal, and the Army and Navy ministers explained it. The meeting was temporarily adjourned. In the afternoon, the government listened to explanations of diplomatic issues. After that, Mr. Okawauchi Teruharu raised questions, and Mr. Mitsui Seiichiro expressed his support. After passing it, the plenary session continued to be held. The temporary military expenditure budget proposal was submitted and entered into articles. The chairman reported the progress of the committee. It was unanimously passed. At this point, the supplementary budget of 25 billion yuan for temporary military expenditure was passed and approved on the third day of the Diet session. During the Diet session, the Japanese people's trust in completing the war and the determination to win the Diet have been fully expressed.</p>
<p>Answering Tsurumi's Questions</p>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) — Tsurumi Yusu, at the House of Representatives Budget General Meeting on the 9th, raised two questions:  Clarify Japan's war aims, which are to defend itself while waging war with force;  Actively launch diplomatic offensives. Prime Minister Koiso and Foreign Minister Shigemitsu respectively clarified Japan's war aims, which are one for defense, two for liberation, and three for the establishment of peace,  A war to eliminate the monopoly system, and replied as follows:</p>
<p>Prime Minister Koiso</p>
<p>The United States' Pacific policy has always been a war of aggression. Although they occupy Hawaii and the Philippines, they still feel insufficient. They are hostile to Japan, which is located in the center of Asia. They have repeatedly suppressed Japan with the ABCD encirclement line. This is the cause of the Greater East Asia War. Japan's aim has been to defend itself as a fundamental spirit. The Emperor has repeatedly told the people that Japan has precedents for going out to conquer, but they all came from defense, and were never for the sake of Japan's own prosperity and development. The spirit of our Emperor can only be realized if all nations get what they deserve.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Shigemitsu</p>
<p>The purpose of war lies in viewing the spirit of war. This is the spirit of gathering the people and making them tend towards Greater East Asia, which may become a great weapon for the world. The Japanese people all know that the various ethnic groups in Greater East Asia are currently engaged in a war for self-preservation and self-defense. Even the enemy people are gradually understanding this point. The United States challenged Japan, causing this Pacific War. Even Britain admits that Japan's war aims have always been self-preservation and self-defense. The purpose of the Japanese Empire's war is to crush the monopoly system, so that all nations in the world can get what they deserve. The purpose of building Greater East Asia has already been clearly explained in the Greater East Asia Declaration in the five major principles, which is why we established the belief that the Greater East Asia War will be won. Regarding</p>
<p>The China Issue</p>
<p>The United States now says that it is fighting to aid China. But is it really helping China? The American military bases in various parts of China are good examples of their sacrifices. It is no exaggeration to say that they are now engaged in a colonial war. The people of East Asia should recognize this in detail and protect their own countries. The United States has always aimed to dominate the world. Here, we can more clearly recognize that the current war is a war of self-preservation and self-defense and a war of colonial imperialism. Their so-called aid to Chongqing is carried out with this kind of imperialistic ambition, but it is only a means of utilization. Nelson and Harley, who were recently sent to Chongqing, still have the purpose of aggression. Japan is completely out to</p>
<p>Cooperate and Harmonize With Greater East Asia</p>
<p>The various ethnic groups have no ambition for territory. Judging from the fact that China is now completely autonomous, it can be clearly understood that China must wait for the Chinese to decide for themselves. Today is the most important opportunity for the Chinese people. We hope to quickly promote their rise.</p>
<p>Korean Railway to be Converted to Double Track</p>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) — At the budget general meeting held by the Japanese House of Representatives on the 9th, Mr. Kogure raised a question about strengthening the Korean railway in order to quickly send materials from China and Manchuria to the mainland. Prime Minister Koiso answered as follows: Compared with maritime transport, railway transport via Korea has now been strengthened. Currently, one-sixth of the transport volume of the Korean railway is for transporting goods to the mainland. However, a part of the Korean railway is still single-track. If we want to further strengthen the transport capacity, we must convert the entire Korean railway to double-track. Therefore, it has recently been decided to transfer a part of the South Manchurian Railway facilities south of Fengtian to Korea.</p>
<p>Japanese Forces Strengthened on the Yunnan-Salween Front</p>
<p>Chongqing Expeditionary Force's Offensive is Obstructed</p>
<p>Salween River, 9th (Central News Agency) — The Chongqing Yunnan Expeditionary Force is active on both sides of the Salween River. Since it has strong forces and excellent equipment, it blindly believes that it can open the Ledo Road. Since the beginning of May, it has surrounded the key points of Tengyue and Longling. For more than four months, it has been obstructed by the Japanese army's valiant fighting and solid defense, and it has suffered losses without making any progress. Recently, the Japanese army has received reinforcements. It first attacked the Chongqing 11th Army Group, which was surrounding Longling. It has now broken through a part of the encirclement network. The Japanese army at the key points is resolutely fighting head-on against the Chongqing army's offensive under the command and supervision of the U.S. military. The fierce battle continues day and night. For example, the Japanese army in Mengduo stubbornly defends with few soldiers. When ammunition is insufficient, it engages in a heroic bayonet fight with the stubborn enemy, and always defends the defense area. The Japanese army defending Tengyue has been holding on to the isolated city under the enemy's fierce artillery fire for more than two months. In addition, the enemy's 5th Division in the Longling area has been trying its best to recapture Longling since July 7, but under the Japanese army's fierce resistance, there have been many deaths, and the hope of recapturing Longling has finally become a pipe dream. The Japanese army's operations on the Salween River front are of great importance. The Chongqing army's offensive this time is mainly based on a large air supply line, relying on the air supply of the Chongqing-U.S. air force. However, due to the valiant fighting of the air force, the Chongqing-U.S. air force has suffered too many losses. In recent days, the Chongqing army's supplies on the Salween River front have entered a difficult path, and its attack power has also declined day by day. At present, the Japanese army's forces are gradually increasing and turning to the offensive. Therefore, the wavering of the Yunnan Expeditionary Force is only a matter of time.</p>
<p>Jiang Frontline, 9th (Central News Agency) — The Chongqing 11th Army Group, surrounding Longling, with the main forces of the 76th, 9th, 33rd, and 23rd divisions, has been blindly attacking the Japanese army at Xiaosong Mountain since the 1st. The Japanese army in that area still secures its position and seizes an important high ground on the south side of Nengling. It is currently continuing to fiercely attack the troops of another high ground.</p>
<p>Japanese Forces Intercept U.S. Aircraft Near Kaifeng and Zhangde</p>
<p>Sixteen Aircraft Shot Down</p>
<p>Japanese Military Base, 9th (Central News Agency) — On the afternoon of the 8th, the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing used B29 aircraft as its main force to bomb Anshan and Benxihu in Manchuria, and three aircraft were shot down by the Japanese military. It is reported that the Japanese air force team chased the U.S. B29 aircraft formation for about 30 minutes in the sky near Kaifeng, Henan at 0:08 PM on the same day, destroying eight of them. Four of them caught fire and fled south. In addition, the Japanese air force team, which was waiting for the U.S. aircraft to return from bombing, also intercepted the B29 aircraft group in the sky near Zhangde, Henan Province, shooting down three of them (one of which has not been confirmed) and destroying one. The Japanese side had no losses. It is now judged that the Japanese military's results were six aircraft shot down (one of which has not been confirmed) and ten aircraft destroyed (four of which caught fire), for a total of sixteen aircraft shot down and destroyed.</p>
<p>Japanese Forces Advance into Guangxi Province, Occupy Dongan and Xinning</p>
<p>Japanese Air Force Rapidly Attacks Baoqing</p>
<p>Hankou, 9th (Central News Agency) — According to a message from the Japanese army base on the Hunan front, the elite Japanese troops are advancing fiercely into Guangxi Province. On the 7th, they completely occupied Lingling City. Another unit, in response, captured Dongan, a key point 35 miles west of Lingling on the border of Guangxi Province, and broke through the mountains on the border of Hunan and Guangxi Provinces, defeating the local Chongqing army. On the morning of the 8th, they occupied Xinning, a key point 70 kilometers west of Lingling. Therefore, the Japanese army's breakthrough of the provincial border is only a matter of time.</p>
<p>Japanese Frontline Aircraft Base, 9th (Central News Agency) — The Japanese air force, which is active on the front line in Hunan, rapidly attacked Shiqing at dawn on the 7th, destroying military facilities and airport facilities in the city.

Several U.S. B-25 aircraft attacked Xinxiang, Zhengzhou, and Dezhou on the 8th, injuring more than ten Chinese and Japanese people, and several barracks were destroyed. The Japanese side shot down and destroyed one B-29 aircraft each.</p>
<p>Chongqing Aircraft Drop Leaflets in Guangdong</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 9th (Central News Agency) — Recently, Chongqing aircraft have indiscriminately bombed the Guangzhou area, and the people have suffered heavy losses, which has caused extreme anger. When bombing Xiguan, Guangzhou on the 7th, many leaflets were dropped, bearing the name "Chinese Air Force 14th Squadron," which was a letter to the people in the peaceful area. The content showed the Chongqing Air Force's resentment towards the U.S. Air Force. It said: Fellow compatriots in the peaceful area, since the establishment of the U.S. Air Force in China, the command of the air force has been completely in the hands of the U.S. Air Force. They always advocate bombing the streets of Guangzhou. Although we have opposed it several times, it has been ineffective. Therefore, we have had to drop bombs in the city, which inevitably endangers the lives and property of our compatriots. We ask for your forgiveness.</p>

<h3>World's Smallest Country: San Marino Reaffirms Neutrality</h3>
<p>Milan, 9th (Central News Agency) — Havas Agency: The world's smallest republic, San Marino, has recently reaffirmed its strict adherence to neutrality. This communiqué was issued when the anti-Axis forces approached the country on the Adriatic coast. This small republic has a population of only 20,000 people. Mount Titano, which is 800 meters high, is within its territory. The mountain is located between Pesaro and Ravenna, so it is a key route to controlling the Po Plain.

<h3>Revision of Provisional Measures for Managing Financial Institutions Approved by Central Political Conference</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) — The revised articles of the Ministry of Finance's provisional measures for managing financial institutions have been approved by the 138th Central Political Conference. The implementing rules and the revised articles of the bank registration regulations have also been prepared for filing. In the future, the management of financial institutions will be further strengthened due to the revision of these measures and implementing rules, which will definitely make a great contribution to the strengthening and stability of the financial system. The records are as follows:</p>
<p>Revised Articles of the Ministry of Finance's Provisional Measures for Managing Financial Institutions:</p>
<p>Article 4 is added: When a financial institution establishes a business location, it shall take a video of the original business license and prepare a submission stating the following items and submit it to the Ministry of Finance for approval and registration:  Name,  Allocated capital amount,  Location of the business location,  Scope of operations,  Business plan,  Business term,  Name and residence of the person in charge,  For business locations that have already started business, a submission shall be prepared within one month from the date of implementation of these measures, stating the items in the preceding paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7, and adding the latest monthly statement of the location and a copy of the approval for establishment, and submitting it to the Ministry of Finance for supplementary registration. (Reason) The establishment of a business location by a financial institution has a significant impact on local finance, and its importance is no less than that of the financial institution itself. The Ministry has always been very cautious in approving the establishment of the above-mentioned business location, and it must be approved and filed by the Ministry before business is allowed. Those who have not obtained this approval belong to unauthorized establishment and can be punished by law. However, this approval is not as good as the business license of the financial institution itself, which can be hung in a prominent place for all to see. Therefore, it is even more difficult to know whether the business location has not been approved by the Ministry and has been established without authorization. Without anyone reporting it, the Ministry has too many affairs and cannot see it all, so there is no way to ban it. The situation in Shanghai is complex, and there are many such incidents. In order to learn from the past, it is really necessary to issue a business license for the business location of a financial institution that has been approved for establishment. Therefore, it is proposed to add this article to achieve the effect of collecting and rectifying. The original Article 4 is changed to Article 5 (the rest are changed accordingly).</p>
<p>The original text of Article 4, paragraph 5: 5. Establishment of a business location, change of business location class or address. (Revised text) 5. Change or abolition of the business location class or address. (Reason) The main point of the amendment of this paragraph is to delete the seven characters (establishment of a business location). Since it is proposed to stipulate that a business location of a financial institution must obtain a business license, these seven characters should be deleted to avoid duplication.</p>
<p>The original text of Article 5: After the end of each business year, a financial institution shall prepare a business report, a balance sheet, a property catalog, and a profit and loss statement within three months and submit it to the Ministry of Finance. (Revised text) After the end of each business year, a financial institution shall prepare a business report, a balance sheet, a property catalog, a profit and loss statement, and a surplus distribution statement within three months and submit it to the Ministry of Finance. The balance sheet, profit and loss statement, and surplus distribution statement in the preceding paragraph shall be publicly announced. (Reason) A financial institution is a credit institution, and its financial status, profit and loss situation, and amount of surplus distribution should be publicly announced so that everyone knows it. There are already provisions in the Company Law, and it is proposed to add and revise this article to show its importance. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>American Forces Launch Pincer Attack on Liège, Germany Establishes New Defense Line on Western Border</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 9th – Huitong News Agency: The German army's western front defenses have been completed with extreme speed, but this was achieved through bitter fighting. The German troops defending Boulogne and Calais are currently doing their utmost to prevent anti-Axis forces from entering the ports along the Strait. After being forced to the coastal areas by the British forces who broke into Antwerp, they are now conducting movements towards the Scheldt River estuary. The Canadian First Army is advancing southeast from Ypres in the south. There has been fierce fighting at the Lys bridge in Ghent, which was still in German hands the night before. The day before, the anti-Axis forces again attempted to forcibly cross the Albert Canal south of Antwerp but failed. The main force of the British Second Army is now in Antwerp, launching a major offensive in the east and northeast of the Leuven line, towards the Albert Canal bay between Antwerp and Hasselt, but has also failed to cross the river. Fierce fighting is currently at a standstill. The American First Army, advancing east from the Namur area, has divided into two routes to break into the northern and southern districts of Liège, seemingly in a pincer movement, in an attempt to seize this strategic location. The anti-Axis forces intend to make the Liège-Antwerp area the focal point of the war, and their goal is clearly to advance into or break into the Aachen basin from North Brabant and Nijmegen.</p>
<p>New German Troops Head to the Front Lines</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 9th – Huitong News Agency: According to the plans of Goebbels, the German Plenipotentiary for Total War Mobilization, the new army established includes units specifically designed to deal with tank forces. These units are equipped with the latest short-range combat weapons, and their personnel consist only of volunteers between the ages of seventeen and thirty-nine. According to a German army commander who told war correspondent Ulrich: he was very pleased to lead well-equipped divisions to the front lines, including the most modern weapons that have never been seen before. The process from the formation of this new army to its deployment to the front lines was extremely rapid, setting a precedent in military history.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Ninth Air Defense Day: Exercises Showed Good Results, Airplanes Dropped Mock Bombs for Evacuation Training</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 9th) was the ninth Air Defense Day. The Municipal Air Defense Headquarters, in view of the current sudden increase in air defense tension, expanded air defense training to ensure that all citizens could maximize their air defense spirit. The entire city entered a state of air defense yesterday morning, and the situation was very tense. Various air defense drills were carried out. The details are listed below:</p>
<p>Warning Training Achieves Good Results</p>
<p>Yesterday, warning training was carried out, but without sounding the alarm. The timing of various training alarms was pre-determined, and the alarm was sounded and the alarm was transmitted by the air defense personnel of each Bao-Jia, and the alarm was transmitted by ringing the bell. At 9:30 a.m., the precautionary alarm order was issued. The Bao-Jia air defense personnel assisted the police in directing traffic, and personnel from rescue and firefighting teams gathered at the Bao offices to prepare for emergencies. At 10:30 a.m., the training air raid alarm was issued. Traffic control was immediately implemented, and Japanese aircraft took off and flew high in the sky, dropping mock bombs. When flying over the local area, the air raid observation posts of each Bao reported. Regardless of police and Bao personnel or civilians, all went to the designated shelters nearby or lay prone on the ground, quickly entering an evacuation state. At 11:00 a.m., the training air raid alarm was lifted, and at 12:00 noon, the training precautionary alarm was lifted. The second training alarm, at 3:30 p.m., was a training air raid alarm. All districts of the city implemented traffic control and other necessary measures in accordance with the regulations of the first air raid alarm. Entertainment venues such as theaters, dance halls, etc. all suspended performances and entertainment for twenty minutes, and movie theaters showed a slide of "Training Air Raid Imminent," to inform the audience. At 4:00 p.m., the training air raid alarm was lifted, and a precautionary blackout was implemented in the evening, with the entire city entering a blackout state. At 10:00 p.m., the training precautionary alarm was completely lifted, and normalcy was restored. The warning training in each district this time achieved very good results.</p>
<p>Each District Seriously Carried Out Evacuation Training</p>
<p>Each district of the city was ordered to carry out comprehensive training in fire fighting and rescue, and to focus on evacuation drills. Regardless of Bao-Jia personnel or civilians, all participated in the training. After the issuance of a simulated air raid alarm at the prescribed time, members of the self-defense corps, police defense corps, and special self-defense air defense corps of nearby large buildings and factories were fully mobilized in full air defense gear to transmit the alarm. Traffic control was implemented in the training area, and vehicles and pedestrians were directed to shelters. Store employees evacuated into the store, and those staying at home had to evacuate into the inner room. When the sky observation post reported the approach of a simulated enemy aircraft or the dropping of a simulated bomb, all Bao-Jia personnel and civilians lay prone in an evacuation posture until the observation post reported that the enemy aircraft had gone away before standing up. After the end of the training and the lifting of the simulated alarm, normalcy was restored. During the training in each district, personnel were dispatched from each police precinct to provide on-site guidance, and corrections were made to those who were uncooperative or made mistakes. At the same time, large stores, banks, companies, hotels, restaurants, entertainment venues, movie theaters, train and ship terminals, factories, business venues, schools, etc. all automatically conducted evacuation drills.</p>
<p>Over a Hundred Mock Bombs Dropped</p>
<p>Furthermore, yesterday, in order to expand air defense training, simulated enemy aircraft flew overhead from 9:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. and from 2:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. During the air raid alarm, paper mock incendiary bombs (red), explosive bombs (yellow), and time bombs (black) were dropped in the prosperous areas south of the Suzhou River. Each district then carried out comprehensive training in evacuation, fire fighting, and rescue. When a simulated enemy aircraft flew overhead, the sky observation posts of each Bao often reported "Enemy aircraft are coming!" Then the messengers rang gongs and knocked on drums, and after each Bao reported, evacuation was immediately implemented. When a bomb was discovered, the relevant police precinct was immediately reported, and methods were used to extinguish and remove the bomb depending on its type. Subsequently, fire fighting and rescue exercises were carried out. More than a hundred bombs were dropped in succession. Evacuation and extinguishing techniques were very skilled. The type and power of the bombs were indicated on the paper bombs, so that Bao-Jia personnel would be familiar with the types of bombs and their explosion potential, making it easier to deal with real bombs.</p>
<h3>Street Photography Exhibition Starts Second Run</h3>
<p>The second street photography touring exhibition, sponsored by the East Asia Traffic Corporation and supported by the Japanese Army Information Department, officially began yesterday (the 9th) and will be publicly exhibited in various locations throughout the city for a period of days. This exhibition features a total of twelve photographs, including the brutal killing of Chinese compatriots by the Chongqing-American air force, the Chongqing government's forced conscription of soldiers and students to the front lines, and the conditions in the new war zones. The scheduled exhibition dates and locations are detailed below:</p>

<h3>Judiciary to Prepare Crime Prevention Drama</h3>
<p>In order to popularize crime prevention work among all levels of society and achieve the expected results, the Judiciary Department of the Municipal Police Bureau has planned to stage a crime prevention drama in the near future. It is said that the script is being written by famous writers, and famous actors from the city's film and drama circles will be invited to collaborate in the performance.</p>
<h3>Representatives of Various Trade Associations Held Talks Yesterday, Director Xu of the Economic Bureau Attended and Gave Instructions</h3>
<p>In order to curb rising prices and stabilize people's livelihood, the Municipal Qing Bureau convened representatives from eighty industrial and commercial associations throughout the city at the bureau's auditorium at 2:00 p.m. yesterday for a discussion. More than fifty units of representatives attended. Director Xu of the bureau gave instructions, first pointing out that the current prices in the city have suddenly risen sharply in recent days, which has a great impact on people's livelihood. It is hoped that all members of the trade associations must recognize the environment, unanimously support national policies, and take the stability of people's livelihood as the premise, and specially put forward three questions for elaboration:</p>
<p>Price Issues are Paramount</p>
<p>Since the year of the ox, the prices in the city, especially the price increases in August, have been considered. Although merchants generally excuse the lack of raw materials and traffic obstruction, according to general goods, the sudden price increases are indeed illegal acts, especially for meat and vegetables, whose sources are all in the suburbs of the city. Therefore, it is considered that the price increase of these two items not only disregards merchant morality but also disrupts commercial standards. Therefore, it is hoped that the merchants of the city must each focus on their own position, determine the governing price, and report to the bureau at any time, and not take the opportunity to raise prices to harm others and benefit themselves.</p>
<p>Regarding Industrial and Commercial Registration</p>
<p>The bureau believes that since the municipal administration of the city has been unified, in order to unify industrial and commercial management, it has been ordered to carry out industrial and commercial registration. Since the beginning, according to statistics, there are more than 100,000 industrial and commercial enterprises in the city that have not yet registered. This has hindered the progress of controlled economic work, which is regrettable. In order to consider the difficulties of merchants, the deadline has been extended repeatedly. It is hoped that all members of the trade will no longer ignore their own interests and will abide by the law.</p>
<p>Liaison Issues: Due to the reorganization of the administrative structure, the bureau and the industrial and commercial circles of the city have found it difficult to maintain contact, and it is impossible to convey official documents in a short time due to the development of industry and commerce in the city. In the future, in order to truly achieve the feelings between the government and merchants, it is planned to hold a city-wide industrial and commercial dinner party every month to listen to commercial information at any time, provide it to the municipal authorities, and try to plan solutions to difficult problems. After Xu's instructions, the representatives of the trade associations reported on commercial information and various difficult problems, hoping that the government would assist in alleviating the current situation faced by various industrial and commercial industries.</p>
<h3>Headquarters of the Self-Defense Corps Announces Its Executives, Headquarters to Hold Inauguration Ceremony</h3>
<p>In order to unify the city's self-defense corps, concentrate strength, and achieve close unity between the police and Bao-Jia, the Shanghai Special City Police Bureau specially established the Self-Defense Corps Headquarters yesterday, the anniversary of the Anti-War Day, with Director Chen concurrently serving as the head of the corps, and Deputy Directors Du Zhengjian, Fu Yingsu, and Cheng Deyi concurrently serving as the deputy heads. All senior officials have taken office and begun work. It is reported that the headquarters, in order to show solemnity, has set a date to hold a joint inauguration ceremony. Those attending at the time will include all senior officials and personnel of the headquarters, as well as the chief Bao chiefs, Bao chiefs, and members of the Bao-Jia committees of each district. At the same time, 50,000 basic members of the self-defense corps will participate in the inspection. The grand occasion will definitely be unprecedented and enthusiastic.</p>
<p>The Self-Defense Corps Headquarters of this city, under the guidance of the Shanghai Police Bureau, was officially established yesterday. A reporter from the Central News Agency specially visited Deputy Director Du and Secretary-General Gu yesterday afternoon, and received the following statements:</p>
<p>Deputy Director Du</p>
<p>Deputy Director Du said in his statement: "The Shanghai Self-Defense Corps Headquarters was established today. This is to lead and organize the Shanghai Bao-Jia self-defense youth, so that they can fulfill their duties and cooperate in defending Greater Shanghai. Looking back, before the recovery of the concessions, due to the special environment, all terrorist crimes, Bao-Jia self-defense, spread throughout the city. Fortunately, with the cooperation of the local people, the number of criminal cases has been gradually reduced, so the effect of establishing the Bao-Jia self-defense corps in Shanghai is not insignificant, and public security relies on it to be consolidated. Last year, the Shanghai concessions were recovered, and the city's administration was unified. The city's police administration was also unified, and the city's Bao-Jia was also unified under the supervision of the Bao-Jia Department. Now, the establishment of the Self-Defense Corps Headquarters will not only enable all self-defense corps members in the city to be commanded under a unified system, but also increase their self-defense power. Under the joint police-Bao-Jia front, public security will be further ensured and strengthened. I am very excited and fortunate about the establishment of the Self-Defense Corps Headquarters today.</p>
<p>Secretary-General Gu</p>
<p>Secretary-General Gu Wu said in his statement: "The Self-Defense Corps Headquarters announced its establishment, on the one hand, to achieve the task of self-defense and self-defense, and on the other hand, to assist the police and military authorities to ensure the foundation of public security. The preparation and establishment of the headquarters is to adapt to the needs of the times. Now that the city's administration is unified, the goal of self-defense and self-defense has achieved considerable results in terms of effectiveness, such as stopping crimes, air defense, and protection, all of which have achieved good results. The service problem of the self-defense corps is that all those aged 18 or above and under 45 must serve, and the number of personnel will be more than 400,000. If they can all effectively shoulder the task of self-defense, I believe that they will not feel pain. Unfortunately, in the past, statistics, surveys, and distribution were carried out without a unified organization. Although there were those who served the public and abided by the law, it is feared that those who took advantage of the law to do evil and cheat were also unavoidable, resulting in the reduction of effectiveness. Therefore, the future work of the headquarters will focus on this point. In addition to the old, young, women, and those who are unable to work, citizens of service age should bear responsibility and should never be arbitrarily exempted. At the same time, in each Bao, in addition to the original ordinary members, outstanding members will be selected to form basic members, who will be trained to instill knowledge and skills in air defense and defense. This process is assisted by each sub-bureau and is entrusted to various specialized agencies to achieve the purpose of police-Bao-Jia cooperation and is named as a model self-defense corps member. In addition, volunteers from factories, shops, schools, institutions, and groups are welcome to receive training and provide enthusiastic service. Our people have always been like a plate of loose sand, and today it is fortunate to have widespread training, and I hope that we will all work together to serve the country and society.</p>
<h3>Stepping Up Epidemic Prevention Work, Taking Emergency Measures, Large Number of Epidemic Prevention Injection Teams Dispatched</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of epidemic prevention injections in this city on May 1 this year, the results have been very good. Up to now, no real cholera has been found. A month ago, the Municipal Epidemic Prevention Committee learned that there was real cholera in the Fuzhou Lianjiang Changle area? It has not been reduced so far, and now it has been reported that real cholera is prevalent in Shijiazhuang in North China and Nanping in South China. The Municipal Epidemic Prevention Committee believes that the traffic between South China, Central China, and North China is frequent, and this infectious disease is very likely to spread. In order to prevent it from invading Shanghai and ensure safety, the Municipal Epidemic Prevention Committee has written to the Japanese Embassy in this city, the Health Bureau, the Police Bureau, and other relevant authorities, instructing their subordinates to strictly prevent it. It is reported that the Municipal Epidemic Prevention Committee has taken emergency measures since yesterday, in addition to strictly implementing the re-examination of vaccination certificates, and dispatched a large number of injection teams.</p>
<p>Checking Certificates</p>
<p>The most likely places for the invasion and spread of epidemic diseases in Shanghai are railway stations and factories. The Municipal Epidemic Prevention Committee, in view of this, sent personnel to railway stations and factories yesterday to check the cholera prevention vaccination certificates of all passengers and employees. Those who were found to be overdue were all given injections to prevent any accidents.</p>
<p>Injections in Each District</p>
<p>At the same time, because only more than one million citizens in each district have been injected in the second phase of epidemic prevention injections, the reason is that the general public avoids injections, which has slowed down the progress of the work. The authorities of the Association, in addition to hoping that the general public will fully assist the Bureau in receiving injections to ensure personal and public safety, will also re-regulate the work time and location of each injection team in accordance with the jurisdiction of each police precinct in this city from the 8th of this month, and will send personnel to secretly investigate at any time to prevent the occurrence of cheating. According to reporters, due to the prevalence of real cholera in North China and South China this time, the period of epidemic prevention work in this city will be extended.</p>
<h3>This Newspaper's Science Award, Second Grant, Research Funding of 50,000 Yuan for Mr. Yang Shuzu, and Incentive Award of 2,000 Yuan for Mr. Ni Gexun</h3>
<p>The second meeting of the Science Award Committee of this newspaper decided to subsidize Mr. Yang Shuzu's research funding of 50,000 yuan and award Mr. Ni Gexun an incentive award of 2,000 yuan. Mr. Yang is a Doctor of Medicine from Nagoya Imperial University in Japan and a Doctor of Medicine from Tokyo Imperial University. He has worked at the Shanghai Institute of Natural Sciences for many years, specializing in pathology and parasitology. His research topics are as follows. Mr. Ni studies electricity in his spare time and uses electric light current to create an "electric fire starter", which is convenient for ignition. It is more durable and does not consume as much electricity as ordinary electric matches. Although it is not an invention, his dedication is commendable. The award from this association is purely to encourage research interest, and it is hoped that people from all walks of life will promote the trend of amateur scientific research.</p>
<p>Research on the Route of Infection of Kala-azar</p>
<p>Kala-azar is prevalent in our country's Huaihai Province and northern provinces, with no less than millions of patients. The causative agent, pathological anatomy, clinical symptoms, and treatment methods have been studied by many scholars and have been solved successively. However, the route of infection has not yet been resolved despite 40 years of research in the medical community. Generally, the kala-azar pathogen enters the human body through sandflies. After the pathogen enters the sandfly's stomach, it becomes a flagellate, and then the flagellate infects the human body. However, how the flagellate transforms into granular pathogens after entering the human body has not been further investigated in detail. Mr. Ishii of Japan conducted an experimental study on the cutaneous infectivity of flagellates, and the result was negative. It is planned to continue three types of experimental research: 1. The fate of kala-azar bodies and flagellates after injection into the abdominal cavity of voles. 2. The fate of kala-azar bodies and flagellates after injection into the veins of twenty-day-old mice. 3. The cutaneous infectivity of the cultured form of kala-azar bodies. This research has been ongoing for one and a half years, and some results have been reported at the East Asia Medical Conference. It is expected to be successful in about a year, and progress reports will be published successively.</p>
<h3>Central Government Stipulates Prohibition of Steelyard Scales</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Chamber of Commerce previously received a request from the Tea and Food Industry Association of this city to write to the City Bureau of Weights and Measures for an explanation of the use of steelyard scales. It is now learned that the association has received notification that "steelyard" scales are an illegal system, and the name was included in the Central Government's unified system and has long been included in the prohibition of manufacturing, selling, and using them. It is hoped that all relevant industries in this city that are still unaware of this regulation will immediately stop using steelyard scales in order to comply with the regulations.

<h3>Secret Story of the Ogasawara Islands</h3>
<p>— Takeshita Gennosuke</p>
<p>]</p>
<p>Discovery of the Ogasawara Islands</p>
<p>The US military will boldly attack Chichijima and Hahajima in the Ogasawara Islands. These two islands are vital points south of the Japanese mainland, administratively belonging to Tokyo. Britain and the United States had attempted to occupy the Ogasawara Islands in the past but were unsuccessful. This secret story will now be revealed.</p>
<p>On November 21, Meiji 8 (1875), a steamship sailed out of Yokohama Port, speeding south. It had two masts, two decks, and a pure white hull, easily recognizable as the Meiji Maru (1,038 tons). It was built by the Japanese Ministry of Industry and had just returned from England in February of that year, being the most modern and excellent ship of the time for lighthouse巡回.</p>
<p>However, today there were no lighthouse bureau personnel on board, and it was certainly not巡行lighthouse. It had another mission. On board were many officials dispatched by the Navy, Interior, Foreign Affairs, and Finance Ministries, called the "Ogasawara Islands Recovery Committee," such as Tanabe Taichi, a fourth-rank official from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Navy Lieutenant Nezu Seikichi, Tax Assistant Hayashi Masaaki, seventh-rank official from the Geography Bureau Kohana Sakusuke, and several attendants. Their destination, needless to say, was the Ogasawara Islands.</p>
<p>The so-called Ogasawara Islands are said to have been discovered by Ogasawara Sadayori, the great-grandson of Ogasawara Nagatoki, the lord of Fukashi (Matsumoto) in Shinano Province, in the second year of Tensho (1593). Sadayori obtained permission from Tokugawa Ieyasu and erected a sign on the island, which read:</p>
<p>"Japanese Country, Amaterasu-Ōmikami Shrine Land, Changyuan Ieyasu, under the admiration of Ogasawara, Fourth Rank Junior General, Minister of Popular Affairs, Source Sadayori 朝臣"(Original text)</p>
<p>From this, it is clear that the Ogasawara Islands were entirely Japanese territory. So, why was a special envoy of officials sent to recover the Ogasawara Islands, which were originally Japanese territory?</p>
<p>After being occupied and developed by Ogasawara Sadayori, the island soon became an uninhabited wasteland due to the difficulty of sea routes and the implementation of the Kan'ei isolation policy. At some point, the island was forgotten. Because it was located to the southeast (south) of the Japanese mainland, it was called "巽uninhabited island". Except for occasional mention of the island by survivors of shipwrecks, it was simply forgotten.</p>
<p>Britain and the United States compete for Pacific islands</p>
<p>During this time, British and American pirate-like whaling ships and exploration ships were constantly watching the island. At that time, they were vying for colonies in the Pacific, competing everywhere, and even appearing near the Japanese mainland. In the sixth year of Bunsei (1823), an American whaling ship arrived at Hahajima, believing that they were the first to discover the island, and named it Coffin Island after its captain Coffin. Two years later, in the eighth year of Bunsei (1825), a British whaling ship arrived at Chichijima, also believing that they had discovered it. In the tenth year of Bunsei (1827), the British government sent a survey ship there, naming it the Peel Islands, and nailed a bronze plaque to a tree at Suzaki on Chichijima, raising the British flag.</p>
<p>After the United States learned of this, they believed that the British occupation of those islands was very inappropriate. In the sixth year of Kaei (1853), when Perry came to Uraga with a fleet, he planned to take the opportunity to seize the island. In July, Perry himself went to Futami Port on Chichijima and raised the American flag on Mount Senpu. Subsequently, in October, he dispatched Commander Corley of the warship Plymouth, under his command, to the island. After landing on Hahajima, Corley immediately renamed Peel Island to Coffin Islands and nailed a bronze plaque to a tree northwest of Okimura on Hahajima. At the same time, he encouraged British and American people who had migrated to the island from Hawaii to organize an organ similar to a provisional colonial government; this was also Perry's intention.</p>
<p>When Japan learned that Britain and the United States were vying for the Ogasawara Islands, which had been Japanese territory since the Bunroku era, even the incompetent shogunate was unwilling to abandon them. In the first year of Bunkyu (1861), in December, it dispatched Foreign Magistrate Mizuno Tadanori and Hattori Kiichi, among others, aboard the warship Kanrin Maru to Ogasawara. After Mizuno and others arrived at Chichijima, they immediately summoned the naturalized islanders, informing them that the island was Japanese territory and encouraging them to develop it. They then built the Grand Jin Shrine, established a temporary遊事place, and erected a development碑inscription, entitled "Record of the New Construction of Ogasawara." At the same time, Kohana Sakusuke was appointed as the island director and sent forty immigrants from Hachijo Island to develop it.</p>
<p>However, soon after the維新started, the government officials and immigrants all returned to mainland Japan, and the development work was abandoned halfway. Then Britain and the United States had another chance to contend for this island. In the eighth year of Meiji (1875), an American woman named Peace came to the Ogasawara Islands, causing a stir both domestically and abroad. At that time, the British minister Parkes, who had been known to the world as an arrogant and rude diplomat since the Japanese Restoration, asked the Japanese foreign affairs authorities: "Are the Ogasawara Islands your country's territory or British and American territory?" The cunning Parkes intended to see how Japan would respond and then argue that the Ogasawara Islands had been occupied by Britain first. However, the Japanese response was very clear: "It is absolutely Japanese territory. From today onwards, we will immediately restart development!"</p>
<p>Thus, the Ogasawara Islands Recovery Committee was urgently dispatched to the island aboard the Meiji Maru.</p>
<p>British warship was one step late</p>
<p>When British Minister Parkes learned that the Japanese government had urgently dispatched the Meiji Maru to the Ogasawara Islands, he was shocked. The next day (November 22), he urgently ordered British Consul Robertson and naval officers to board the British warship Cariou, which was anchored in Yokohama, to pursue the Meiji Maru. Since receiving the reply from the Japanese authorities, his ambition to occupy the Ogasawara Islands had been half shattered. However, Parkes, whose heart was not yet dead, knew that Japan would definitely take steps to recover the Ogasawara Islands and still attempted to产制prevent the actions of the Japanese envoy.</p>
<p>However, the Japanese also anticipated this, so they strictly ordered the Meiji Maru captain, Englishman Heatorls, not to dock at Miyake Island and Hachijo Island, the planned stopover points, but to sail straight to the Ogasawara Islands. The Meiji Maru's average speed was eleven and a half knots per hour, which was considered very fast at the time. As a result, the Meiji Maru sailed into Futami Port on Chichijima on the 24th, two days earlier than the planned date.</p>
<p>After landing, the envoy immediately gathered the naturalized inhabitants on board and sternly stated that Japan was determined to manage the entire island from now on. At the same time, they investigated the islanders' household registrations and provided them with the necessary equipment for development. As a result, they happily obeyed the orders and engaged in development under the protection of the Japanese Empire. According to the household registration survey at that time, all the people on the island were naturalized foreigners, totaling fourteen households and seventy-one people.</p>
<p>It is said that the British warship Cariou, which left Yokohama a day later, had secretly communicated with the Meiji Maru's Captain Heatorls and learned that the Meiji Maru would stop at Miyake and Hachijo Islands. Therefore, it was planned that the two ships would arrive at Chichijima at the same time on the 26th. However, the Meiji Maru changed its planned route as mentioned above, sailed at full speed, and headed straight for Chichijima, avoiding the Cariou. Therefore, the Cariou was two days behind the Meiji Maru and only appeared in Futami Port on the 26th. It arrived too late; the Japanese envoy had already completed the recovery of the Ogasawara Islands.</p>
<p>British Consul Robertson was inevitably extremely frustrated, but the cunning British did not show their喜怒emotions. He suppressed his disappointment and put on a great show, saying to the Japanese envoy:</p>
<p>"I congratulate you on the speedy and successful recovery of your country. I came to this island at the request of Minister Parkes, only to correct the actions of the island's American Peace, with no other intention. The British government also believes that if it were to possess this island for the purpose of protecting the British on the island, it would have to protect the British on the surrounding islands as well, and to avoid trouble, it would be better to abandon it. Therefore, we have no objection to these islands being managed by your country today."</p>
<p>He stayed on the island for several days and then quietly returned to Yokohama. While staying on Chichijima, he happened to learn that the bronze plaque that the British had nailed to a tree at Suzaki on Chichijima in previous years (i.e., 1827) was being kept by a naturalized islander, so he asked for it and took it back. Besides bringing this gift back to Parkes, he probably had nothing else.</p>
<p>Kohana Sakusuke, a patriot who managed the South</p>
<p>In this way, Japan's southern gateway was finally returned to Japanese territory at the critical moment. In the same year, it was decided to develop the entire island as a directly controlled territory of the Ministry of Interior. The following year, 1876, Kohana Sakusuke, one of the members of the Recovery Committee, was appointed as the Interior Ministry権 少丞 and ordered to lead more than ten subordinates to the island to take office. In the tenth year of Meiji (1877), a branch office of the Ministry of Interior was established at Senpu on Chichijima to manage the entire island's administration. This first generation island magistrate of the Ogasawara Islands, Kohana Sakusuke, as mentioned earlier, had been engaged in cultivating the island since the time of the shogunate and was a patriot with unique insights in southern management.</p>
<p>In the first year of Bunkyu, he accompanied Foreign Minister Nagano Tadanori to the island. When he was ordered to stay on the island, he learned that there were uninhabited wasteland islands such as Parece Vela (currently known as Okinotorishima) two hundred miles south of the island (i.e., the northern islands of the Mariana Islands). He and Matsumoto Sanjinojo, among others, suggested to the shogunate that exploring and managing these islands could be used as a base for Japan's southern advance along with the Ogasawara Islands. Since the Meiji era, he had enthusiastically planned for key routes to recover the Ogasawara Islands and finally recovered them.</p>
<p>In November of the tenth year of Meiji, when he was the island magistrate, he erected the Ogasawara Islands Development Monument on Mount Naryo on Chichijima. The inscription was written by Councilor Okubo Toshimichi, and it read, "One mountain range of Izu undulates and ends here; it is our southern gate." After seeing this, Kohana Sakusuke immediately chiseled away the words "and ends." The island official did not know who the culprit was who had destroyed those two words. Kohana learned of this and explained to him, telling him that the words "and ends" were superfluous because the Ogasawara Islands were Japan's gateway to managing the South and should never "end" here, so he deliberately removed them. The island official was very impressed with his view. Like this, he hoped that Japan's southern gateway would not end in the Ogasawara Islands area and would extend further south in the future, demonstrating his spirit of managing the South.

<h3>Playing in the Water</h3>
<p>— Everyone</p>
<p>It's supposed to be autumn, but the air is always filled with heat, stuffiness, and restlessness; the flames of summer still linger, burning in the hearts of every city dweller.</p>
<p>A few days ago, at the Suzhou Creek section of the Garbage Bridge, there were more than a dozen wild children, bathing in the black, polluted water of the Suzhou Creek in the evening sun. One by one, they splashed water and played with each other, the water dripping from the creek as they climbed up, then jumped off the banks and桥piers, making a "plop" sound on the surface of the river; one followed another in clumsy and ugly paired swims, throwing a stone into the bottom of the river, and then diving into the water to search for this stone... The scene was lively and active, revealing childlike and innocent joy. City people were curious. Tired of the slow and refined swimming in the swimming pool, seeing these wild children's splashing and rough style was like opening their eyes, filled with an indescribable interest. So, rows of pedestrians lined the banks and桥railings, all temporarily stopping for the temptation of the children playing in the water. They watched earnestly, appreciating, but their psychology of watching and appreciating was abnormal. Sometimes a burst of laughter would erupt on their faces, even waving their hands and applauding, like the laughter caused by watching a pair of seals playing ball in a circus.</p>
<p>"Hey! Hey..." A gentleman-type waved his hand at the children in the water, and at the same time pointed to the highest point of the桥railing and continued: "Jump down from here, jump down from here, and I'll give him a hundred yuan..." This gentleman proudly took out a hundred-yuan bill from his pocket and waved it. Tempted by the profit, a thin child finally tried, thus winning the啧啧praise of a group of people, followed by another group of irrelevant哈哈laughter. But everyone forgot the danger of the child jumping down from a river surface more than ten feet high, or that the value of the child's life was only worth a hundred-yuan bill, even more, that they forgot that these were of the same species, and the distinction between those in the water and those on the shore created such an isolating boundary for humanity - a terrifying boundary that deviates from human nature.</p>
<p>I天天travel along the Suzhou River畔bank, see the towering文明buildings on both sides, the摩托cars coming and going, and at the same time the河piers issuing苦役efforts, the eighteenth-century篷棚boats on the river, and deeply feel that the city is filled with contradictions and disharmony; now seeing the children playing in the water and the living drama of watching the children play in the water, I feel even more that this human place is filled with contradictions and disharmony. Children are innocent and optimistic. Their splashing and joy when playing in the water, a mischievous相look, often pull me back to my childhood dreams. But every time I come back from my治事place in the evening and see them, it often arouses a bit of inexplicable emotion, and I really wonder where it comes from. "They are all Chinese children," I thought. "They are all hopeful, all the pillars of tomorrow's country and the cornerstones of society." I also try to imagine a deeper level. But the life they lead every day is打拾撿拾picking up, wandering, without control; they dare not even be certain that a day's life can fill their肚子stomachs. A piece of 布末布料end, a small 段段section of 香烟烟头cigarette butt, all kinds of事物things! are their working goals, the object of their lives; what they need is the问问余remainder of the world, their lives are建染built upon these 天问问余heavenly sleep remnants - naturally, even the lowest and smallest survival desire is not enough, so their eyes turn to the loading trucks coming out of the warehouse. The trucks are crowded with bags of 米毅beans, wheat, etc., all the necessary grains for humans. The trucks are like horses on a疆场battlefield, galloping past one by one, leaving behind some scattered grains, and these children争呀夺啊snatch and grab, scrambling to put them into their pockets. Sometimes, taking advantage of an opportunity when there is no 路路巡patrol警police, they rush in 窠窝a swarm behind the truck. Several顽强strong ones hang on the truck's屁股butt, using their hands or硬器hard objects to戳戳poke a corner of a 麻袋麻袋sack, and let the 米粒rice grains and 黄豆soybeans inside slide out, so everyone滿意滿意的atisfiedly争拾拾grab and抢抢snatch,喜悦喜悦joyfully竞争competing. One day, I 親親personally saw a 汚汚dirty face的女女girl, 扒扒holding on to the left側side of the 卡卡truck, one hand挡挡blocking the上上面above and 管管controlling the人人person's竹竿bamboo pole鞭鞭whip韃韃lashes, one hand尽量尽量trying to挖挖dig out a 大大大big把把handful of山芋乾dried sweet potatoes from the 麻麻sack口mouth and 向向pouring into the空空space,似似like雨点雨点raindrops 般般的falling on the地上ground, she 从从endured袋袋the sack上上面above人人的person's鞭打whipping,和和and 毒毒罵骂vile scolding,换换changing for的是是which is车车behind 的的一群group 孩子孩子们拾拾kids picking 山芋乾sweet potato fill tofill hunger's喜悅joy.

<h3>The Beauty of Imperfection</h3>
<p>— 維新</p>
<p>Kushida Byakuson believed that "the beauty of imperfection" is like the mole of a so-called beauty. Indeed, without ugliness, how can beauty be highlighted? Xi Shi had a heart ailment, which was an imperfection, but it made her beauty even more apparent. A calm ocean rises into a huge wave, which is an imperfection, but it makes its magnificence even more evident. Similarly, how do we know if losing a horse is not a blessing? And if after climbing over layers of hills, we get a little rest, which is better than sitting at home in silence? It should be very clear!</p>
<p>The road of life is rugged and uneven, filled with many imperfections, so to seek satisfaction, one must obtain it from imperfections. Hope and desire are endless, so "life" is an endless journey!</p>
<p>Humanity has an endless journey, but it is also constantly evolving. The reason why humanity seeks evolution is to constantly satisfy its imperfections, but it also incessantly creates new imperfections. These are all the things that make humanity human and naturally different from animals. In this way, the world will have a revived and thriving vitality.</p>
<p>If everyone were like animals, just eating when they are hungry and sleeping when they are tired, with neither imperfection nor satisfaction, then what kind of situation would the world be in? Wouldn't it be a cold and desolate ruin?</p>
<p>Vulgar sayings from Huang-Lao philosophy, such as "A tree grows a thousand feet tall, but its leaves fall back to their roots," "Turn big things into small things, and small things into nothing," "After going a mile out the door, don't get to the house," are all plain and uninteresting, declining day by day. They fundamentally do not know "the beauty of imperfection"!</p>
<p>Lao Tzu's ideal is to return people to the natural state of infancy. His advocacy is to abandon learning and have small countries with few people. Why? He said, "When the Great Way is abandoned, there is benevolence and righteousness; when wisdom arises, there is great hypocrisy; when the six relatives are not in harmony, there is filial piety and kindness; when the country is in chaos, there are loyal ministers." He is a passive ascetic. His doctrine is regressive and does not conform to the principle of evolution. If humanity were to truly return to the original state of infancy, then what is the value of being human? "The Great Way is abandoned," "there is great hypocrisy," "the six relatives are not in harmony," and "the country is in chaos" are all imperfections. Conversely, "wisdom arises," "there is benevolence and righteousness," "there is filial piety and kindness," and "there are loyal ministers" are all evolutions. This is imperfection with evolution.</p>
<p>"Life" is an endless journey; in fact, besides God and the heavenly kingdom that our hearts yearn for, there are no imperfect people and no imperfect world. In this way, humanity will have evolution; the world will have vitality. "The beauty of imperfection" is truly so great!</p>
<p>We are now in an era of the deepest personal imperfections, social imperfections, and national imperfections. In other words, we are standing in the most vibrant society. If we strive tirelessly, we will surely gain the greatest satisfaction. But those who "would rather be a dog in a well-governed era than a person in a chaotic time" cannot appreciate the vitality of this era. The reason is very simple: they do not understand the meaning of "the beauty of imperfection."</p>
<p>Schopenhauer and Nietzsche believed that the world is evil, so they said that life is a "tragedy." Li Bai said, "Life in this world is like a great dream; why trouble our lives?" The ancients said, "The net is vast, and if you jump out of one net, you enter another." These all detest life, and I must object! No! Precisely because the world is imperfect, life can obtain true interest. Life is simply a "comedy"! As for those who do not understand "the beauty of imperfection," are they not people of the 道道way? Because they originally do not recognize the true meaning of life!</p>
<h3>Old Headmaster</h3>
<p>— Ling Zuren</p>
<p>Having laid down the burden of "joyfully nurturing talents" and leaping into the unfamiliar industrial circle.</p>
<p>The "old headmaster" from my middle school days has already laid down the burden of "joyfully nurturing talents" and leaped into the unfamiliar industrial circle:——He has started working as the "Director of Factory Affairs" at our Wuxi branch.</p>
<p>In the past, his eyes were daily met with chalk, red ink, roll books, the thin faces of teachers, and the naive yet innocent students... Now, he has exchanged them for spindles, looms, and various kinds of woolen cloth. The people he interacts with have also changed to some rough or sallow male and female workers, and colleagues from all levels...</p>
<p>From "learning" to "industry," the environment has changed completely. The things around him have also completely changed in quality and form.</p>
<p>The sounds that once filled his ears were the loud reading and singing voices of students. Now, they are replaced by the monotonous and heavy mechanical sounds.</p>
<p>Regarding this, our old headmaster must feel a sense of loss!</p>
<p>I remember that I hadn't seen him since I left school until recently, when I finally saw him again at the factory in Shanghai.</p>
<p>He was still tall and stout, with a slightly balding head and a kind smile... Although these things had been separated from me for several years, I felt that they still maintained their original state. However, time is the most unforgiving, so it was not difficult to detect a trace of age on the old headmaster's face that was not there before. His complexion also seemed a bit darker than before, but his spirit was still as vibrant as ever.</p>
<p>At that time, I saw him and greeted him, but for some reason, I couldn't muster the courage to talk to him. I just sat silently in a corner of the office, secretly looking at his familiar, kind face and quietly listening to the peaceful words flowing from the corner of his mouth—at the time, he was surrounded by some superior colleagues—from his peaceful conversation, I immediately remembered his moving speeches at the weekly assemblies during my school days.</p>
<p>Now, it is still the same person in front of me, and the same mouth is speaking. However, time will never flow backward! Everything now is different from before. The "old headmaster" of now is definitely not the "old headmaster" of the past, just as a student who was once taught by him is no longer the student he once was.</p>
<p>The "old headmaster's" topics have now shifted from "advanced algebra" and "physics and chemistry" to 42-count double-ply yarn, "body size," "raw materials," and "business strategies"... I felt my heart entangled by an inexplicable emotion. Was it sadness? Joy? A sense of bewilderment made it hard to analyze.</p>
<p>The "old headmaster" also talked about "life" like ordinary people. From his slightly furrowed brows, I saw clearly that the shadow of "making a living" had universally enveloped people from all walks of life.</p>
<p>Several times, his gaze intersected with my gaze, which was fixed on him. I felt a slight tremor throughout my body and immediately looked away, much like when I was in school and he had exposed my secrets. However, he would never punish me now!</p>
<p>I temporarily closed my eyes, silently recalling everything from my school days. Although those past events have faded like smoke, they still carried a faint sense of warmth as they slowly resurfaced in my memory.</p>
<p>Unable to resist the urging of my heart, I opened my eyes again. I took a deep look at him. He was still sitting peacefully, a gray woolen robe wrapped around his body and mind, weary from travel. I wonder if he still had the enthusiasm he had before, wearing shorts and competing with us on the sports field for the football championship!</p>
<p>He looked at me several times. I thought: He probably doesn't remember this naughty student of his anymore! Yes! However, even a person with a strong memory would find it hard to remember thousands of students. However, thousands of students will definitely remember him—and of course, I am one of them.</p>
<p>Several times, I wanted to summon up the courage to stand up, run to his side, and have a private, heart-to-heart conversation with him. However, my "ordinariness" suppressed me. I didn't want to cause him disappointment with my "ordinariness." It was better for him not to remember me!</p>
<p>After that, although he stayed at the factory in Shanghai for quite a while, I never went to talk to him. I kept myself hidden in "mediocrity."</p>
<p>Now, he has returned to the Wuxi branch to work. Of course, he will never see this "ordinary" article written by one of his "ordinary" students! I can only silently wish this kind "old headmaster" eternal health at the end of this article!</p>
<h3>Dry Well</h3>
<p>— Zhu Jingqing</p>
<p>Under the plane tree in front of the door,</p>
<p>There is a dilapidated old well; The bottom of the well is already dry, The well stones are covered with old green moss In the past years, It once reflected the moon, clouds, and stars in the sky, And it also illuminated my childhood innocence</p>
<p>And carefree face;</p>
<p>Now, the bottom of the well is filled with messy</p>
<p>Piles of rocks and weeds.</p>
<p>Ah! The dry old well,</p>
<p>Can it reflect the ever-changing moon, clouds, and stars in the sky again?</p>
<p>The vanished years, Can you give me back my past spirit and beautiful dreams?</p>

<h3>Review of the Three Strongest Softball Teams' Techniques: Pandas Defeated Pirates, Will Fight West Youth This Morning</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Softball League has been going on for two months, and the strengths and weaknesses of each team are now clear. Currently, only three teams are qualified to compete for the championship: the Chinese powerhouse Pandas (Pandsa), West Youth (Y Cnbs), and the Portuguese Red Sox (Lusitano Reds). The Philippine Community Team A and the Pirates have each lost twice. Last Sunday (September 3rd), the Pandas defeated the Pirates 4-0. In that game, the Pandas players returned to normal, but there was still no improvement in their hitting.</p>
<p>This morning (10th) at 10:45, the Pandas will face the West Youth team, one of the three strongest teams in the league, at Jiaozhou Park. If it rains and the ground is wet, the game will be postponed. This battle will determine the success or failure of the two teams, because whoever wins will have the right to compete against the strongest Portuguese Red Sox for the championship title. Therefore, in today's battle, both sides will do their best to win. At the same time, the Pandas want to win glory for the Chinese in the softball arena, which is dominated by Westerners. Success or failure depends on this one move. Now, based on the impressions gained from recent battles among these three strongest teams, I will briefly describe them below:</p>
<p>The Pandas excel in fielding, but their hitting is not satisfactory</p>
<p>The Pandas' infield fielding was fully demonstrated in the battle against the Philippine Community Team. In particular, the shortstop of Liang Sheng, a famous player who studied in Japan, showed the most skill. First baseman Wang Nianzu has made rapid progress in the last two games, and his catching is very stable. In addition, pitcher Li Qiteng's pitches in recent games have been so fast and steep that they almost surpass those of Tombala of the Portuguese Red Sox. Mr. Li is still young, and if he works harder, he will undoubtedly be the best softball pitcher in Shanghai. Furthermore, outfielders Tang Weiye and Zhao Sen have both shown improvement. However, the most regrettable thing is that third baseman Wen Ruixiong and second baseman Wen Tianhua are both declining. Both of them are famous players who studied in Japan, but they have not performed well in the games, probably due to lack of practice. In terms of hitting, the Pandas are the most unsatisfactory. No matter how good the fielding is, it is in vain if there is no way to attack. It is said that recently, team leader E Sen and coach are guiding the players' hitting skills at the Donghua Stadium day and night, so there may be a good performance today. We will wait and see.</p>
<p>West Youth has average talent, with both offense and defense showing skill</p>
<p>West Youth is the incarnation of the giant basketball team. Such as Ao Chai Liao, Kai Kuo Mi Luo Fu, Que Li Bo Ke and others. Moreover, the Japanese famous general Ueshima is the shortstop, like a tiger with wings, this gentleman is a left-handed batter (Leff-handbatter) can be called a tiger general. However, the only weakness of the team is its lack of stamina. If they lose several points at the beginning, they will be disorganized and have no fighting spirit. This is most easily seen in the battle with the Portuguese Red Sox. On the contrary, if they win at the beginning, they will work hard to the end and never give up. This seems to be consistent with their basketball style.</p>
<p>The Portuguese Red Sox have the strongest offense and the best defensive outfield</p>
<p>The Portuguese Red Sox team, known as the all-around team, has been intimidating since winning the last championship. The soul pitcher Tombala is indispensable to the team. In the last two battles, he hit two home runs in a row. This gentleman is the biggest contributor to the team's undefeated record. Looking back at the battle against the Pandas last week, the Chinese team lost a fatal three points in the first inning because of his fierce hitting. Also, in the battle against the Philippine Community Team last week, the Portuguese team would have been hopeless for the championship without this gentleman. Because in that battle, the Philippine Community Team was still leading 4-0 in the fourth inning. At the end, the Portuguese team relied on his amazing hitting skills to tie the score. When the Portuguese team won first base in the extra inning, it was Tombala's turn to hit. This gentleman was like a god, swinging desperately. He actually hit a home run, and the Portuguese team turned defeat into victory. This gentleman should be called a hero. In the future, if the Pandas can meet this team again, this gentleman should be paid close attention to, and it is better to send him to "free first base" than to let him hit a shared ball. The outfield of the Portuguese team is the best, they catch every ball. The defeat of the Pandas is really due to this. Only today, Yan will serve the friendship and win the throne. Bai Ma will perform</p>
<h3>Small Football is Booming, There Will Be a Wonderful Performance Today</h3>
<p>— Zheng Duan</p>
<p>The prosperity of small football this summer is unprecedented and beyond expectations. This competition could have ended earlier, but due to continuous rain, there are still games to be played in each cup, but they are all at the final stage, which is very exciting. Especially today's two scenes at the Youth Friendship Association will be a grand gathering of small football. The program is the first small football Group A finals hosted by the Shanghai Small Football Federation, where Lianyi and Huatong will compete for the throne. In addition, a performance match will be added, with the Baima team, a personification of Donghua, facing the Qiaolian team, a variant of Yijiang. In terms of the personnel of the four teams, the famous Shanghai first-rate football generals have been almost all gathered. It should be a different style for football players to try small football. Moreover, since small football is the basis of football, today's battle can be observed by the younger generation. The reporter has visited the performances of each team many times and briefly described the tactics in order to bid farewell to the first small football league, which was once extremely popular.</p>
<p>Lianyi and Huatong have the same style</p>
<p>The above two teams rely on their team members' rich experience and extraordinary skills in the first small football game, so wherever they go, they will be defeated, so they reached today's final. Both teams have the same playing style, both with brute force, so the battle between the two heroes depends on luck at that time. It is said that Lianyi's talent is ultimately superior, and the hope of victory is more guaranteed, but Huatong's small football does have its own special points. The forwards and defenders can be integrated into one, which is the highest level of small football. Moreover, Captain Liu has recovered from his injury and is on the battlefield today, so it is not necessarily that his hopes are selected less. Furthermore, the organizers of the two teams also inherited the same family, which is no different from boiling beans to burn beans. I wonder if the former can be in a hurry?</p>
<p>Baima is strong, how is Qiaolian?</p>
<p>Baima is all Donghua soldiers, and Yan Shixin, a famous general from Hong Kong, has joined the battle. If there is no more battle, then Baima will be completely Donghua. The fans praised Baima's performance in the Fuhua Cup. The skills are excellent, and the tactics can be adapted to the situation and win by surprise. Today's opponent is the Qiaolian team, which has never shown its face in small football. How are their skills? How to speculate? However, looking at its announced lineup, it is all famous people, and there are also two Yijun from Tianjin participating. Therefore, I mean that Baima's victory today must rely entirely on the magical transmission and delicate skills, and the application is abundant, so that it can succeed.</p>
<p>In short, these two football matches will definitely be loved by the general public. It is expected that the Youth League stadium will have an unprecedented grand occasion. The reporter is very impressed with the environment of the stadium. Today, he will definitely make an appointment with three or five colleagues, ride a bicycle, and take a trip to the suburbs. When he arrives at the stadium, it is also full of trees, and the autumn is refreshing, which is also a good pastime for the holiday.</p>
<h3>Sports Anecdotes</h3>
<p>Lin Zuoshi, the main cadre of the Shantou Sports Association, was seriously injured and is currently receiving treatment. I wish him a speedy recovery!</p>
<p>The volleyball league has all ended, and the championship team in Group B is the Yongsanyi team. It is said that the award ceremony will be held on a selected date. This time, the prizes are one flag for each championship team. After all, prices are soaring and silver cups are also expensive, so the authorities have to do this. Fortunately, the prizes are still an encouragement. I think the teams will not care.</p>
<h3>Hopes for the Football Federation</h3>
<p>— Bixian</p>
<p>The Shanghai Football Federation has been established for a year. Although its achievements have not been perfect in the past year, as a newly established organization, the grand and enthusiastic scenes and smooth progress of each game show that the association has worked hard and has been meticulous in its work. However, precisely because the income of the game is considerable, it inevitably arouses suspicion from all walks of life. The spread of rumors inevitably disappoints those who do the work. In fact, the association is a public organization, and its accounts are clearly listed, so why should we bother to talk about it? The writer, the golden wind is sending coolness, the season is entering autumn, and the football season is coming. The Football Federation will reorganize its organization once a year in accordance with the regulations. The last general manager, Mr. Zhou Jiaqi, expressed his fatigue. Mr. Zhou has a long history of serving the sports world and has made outstanding achievements. It is a pity that he is leaving! Now, Mr. Zhou's resignation has been approved by the highest authorities. The new organization and new candidates of the association were announced the other day.</p>
<p>In terms of organization, there are four groups under the Standing Committee: the first group is general affairs, the second group is allocation, the third group is ticketing, and the fourth group is finance. Each group has one director and one deputy director:</p>
<p>First Group Director Tan Xi Deputy Director Shen Huichun</p>
<p>Second Group Director Yue Xiurong Deputy Director Jin Sui</p>
<p>Third Group Director Ma Runfang Deputy Director Yang Ping</p>
<p>Fourth Group Director Tan Jing Deputy Director Huang Zhaohong</p>
<p>Now that the organizational structure has been updated and the candidates for each department have been carefully selected, with its complete organization and excellent personnel, the leapfrog development of the Football Federation this year can be predicted! At this time of metabolism, I wrote a few words, the paper is short and the love is long, and we really have unlimited expectations, that is, to present it to the Football Federation gentlemen!</p>
<p>It is also learned that the association stipulates that a welfare game will be held once a month from this season. Judging from the enthusiastic situation of fans in the past, there is no doubt that the welfare cause will be promoted.</p>
