<p>代論</p>
<h3>談歐局</h3>
<p>— 陳彬龢</p>
<p>問：這幾天各界的視線又由日本內閣改組問題，轉向於歐州問題了。而且還有不少人，因歐洲時局而推想到東亞局勢，未知尊意如何？</p>
<p>答：目前歐洲的形勢，和東亞時局，完全為兩件事，不能倂為一談，至於因歐局而析杞憂，更不免有庸人自擾之議吧！</p>
<p>問：歐州時局的近情如何？</p>
<p>答：歐洲時局，大家最注目的似乎還是德元首希特勒遇刺問題。其實這件事業已明日黃元，憶無待猜測，依照各方面的報導，以及希特勒元首的廣播演詞，可知　行兇人犯，只是德國若干非現役的將校，與德國作虞指導部無關，對於士氣及民心並無影響。　現在德國政府已任命戈林爲最高軍事代表，希墨萊爲國內防衛軍統帥，國防力可益臻强化。</p>
<p>問：然則歐洲戰局的趨勢如何？</p>
<p>答：歐洲戰局的前途，不取決於德國內精，重要的關鍵，在乎下列二者：　東綫，　北法，　巴爾幹。關於東界綫的戰局，自英美侵歐登陸戰開闢以來，蘇聯即乘機發動大規模的夏季攻勢，戰况劇烈。但是北部芬蘇前錢，蘇軍占取維堡後即毫無進展。南部烏克蘭羅馬尼亞前綫的紅軍，亦徘徊於喀爾巴阡山麓，一籌莫展。只有中部「波羅的海沿岸」三軍及「白俄羅斯」三軍，較有推進，北路巳逼近東普魯士國境，南路亦侵入舊波蘭而有威脅波京華沙的趨勢。然而這一方面的德軍，都已按照預定計劃，予蘇軍以打擊，然後從容突團，蘇軍包圍殲滅的計劃，並未完全成功。</p>
<p>至於北法方面，美英攻部隊雖多，然而侵占地域，至今未有超出一百公里者，其所以未能如東綫之猛進，一由於德軍之堅強的防術力及巧妙的戰術，二由於英美軍士無鬥志。</p>
<p>此外義大利戰綫，反軸心軍亦無重大進展，即早爲眾所矚目之巴爾幹半烏，迄今整個形勢仍有利於軸心同盟國。</p>
<p>問：美英蘇聯間的關係有何新發展？</p>
<p>答：從整個世界戰局觀，英美迄今仍處於不利的地位，這是彰彰明甚的事實。所以英美在戰略上，不得不受制於蘇聯。然而蘇聯在歐洲及巴爾幹方面軍事和政治的勢力日趨擴張，則英美對蘇的欵忌反感也日益增加。這也是不容忽視的事實。因此，我們可以推想到：　今後英美蘇在攻歐戰略上的矛盾，必將日益尖銳化；　今後英美蘇對歐洲各流亡政權的外交戰將日形激烈；　今後英美蘇由戰略到政略的衝突，仍不可免。</p>
<p>問：反軸心國對東亞的動態如何？</p>
<p>答：反軸心對歐洲的矛盾，目前尚因戰局嚴重而未遽袋面化，可是，對東亞政策的矛盾，是非常公開的，去年蘇聯爲日蘇中立協定而拒不參加羅邱蔣開羅會議，今年日蘇又有新協定宣告成立，即可見蘇聯決不願為英美所利用而為共在東亞的爪牙。這一事實，對於日本北疆之安全，具有極大的作用。同時，英美也因此在東亞是孤立的，加以在此歐局日趨嚴運之際，英美都巳爲歐戰而痛感精疲功書之苦，他們所以向塞班島大宮島冒險侵攻，正是他們在精疲力盡之際內心煩躁的表現而已。</p>
<h3>日舉行定例閣議　檢討現戰局措置　决定明处度預算編造方針</h3>
<p>東京二十六日中央社電日木二十五日之定例閣議，上午九時在宮內舉行，小磯首相等閣僚全體出席，由軍方報告戰况，中午零時十五分，全體在首相官邸進午餐，一時十分繼續開會，由重米外相說明最近歐洲情勢，旋議決關於藏相所提明年度預算編造方針後，懇談目前各問題，下午三時七分散會。又新內閣連日協議關於應付重大戰局之國內態勢强化事件，幷於二十五日定例閣議中，就當前戰局之措置問題，閣員問交換意見，今後更將作具體之檢討。</p>
<p>東京二十六日中央社電　日本明年度預算編造造方針，經石渡藏相與大藏省務當局磋商結果，現已準備完畢，二十五日經由定例閣議正式決定，二十五日下午三時由情報局正式發表。按新預算之編造，乃基於小幾·米內內閣之發軍國家總力方針，其要點如下：國家總力參戰，發揮全智全能力，以實踐忍苦耐勞，强化必勝不敗體勢爲最要目的。在預算編成及實行上，均採取機動性編造方針，以應付戰局，對急轉或空襲及其他不測事件，嚴密審慎國家資金，物資動貝，勞務動員計劃，預算飛機增產及其他應急施策。基於上項方針，各省之新預算一概不予承認，僅按概定經費推行，概定經費外，以預算費作臨時之支出，因之過去數年來蹈襲之預算統制大綱及列議計劃方式等，完全廢止。因情勢之變化，應行事項，由閣議或由官會議決定，此種機動的預算方式，頗堪注目。</p>
<h3>國防會議例會通過　鄕村建設計劃大綱</h3>
<p>南京廿六日中央社電　今（廿六）日國防會議舉行第五十二次會議，宣讀上次會議紀錄後，開始討論，茲摘錄決議要案如左：</p>

<p>主席交議，秘書處案呈，准國民政府文官處函，爲國民政府宴請東亞醫學會會員臨時費四萬三千九百四十七元四角，業經遵諭將支付帳據先送審計部審核。茲准該部函復，上項臨時費已依法審核，尙無不合等由，請轉陳鑒核追認飭據等情，請公決案，決議通過。　主席交議，秘書處案呈，准國民政府參軍處函，爲本處經辦卅三年元彈慶典臨時費一萬九千八百五十七元，業經連諭將支付帳據，先送審計部審核。茲准訪部函復，上項臨時費已依法審核，尚無不合等等由，請轉陳鑒核追認飭撥等情，請公決案，決議通過。於人事任免，主席交護，　華北政委會幫務委。兼敎育總署督辦王談呈辭本兼各職，應予照准，特任王克艘兼敎育總署督辦。　特派孫育才爲新運會委員。</p>
<p>南京廿六日中央社一電　事變以還，農村衰敗已極，幾無建設之可哲。其衰敗原因，雖有多端，主要者不外農們治安不良，地方行政不健全，農產品之價格運輸諸問體，未能謀得合理解決，以是生產減少，農民生活頓陷苦境，影嚮所及，使社會經濟動盪不定，行政力量，無從發揮。全國經濟委員會，爲針對病態，諜求改善，特擬具鄉村建設計劃大綱，交由國防會前修正通過，並擬短期內組織鄉村建設實施委員會，以負責推動該項計劃，各方對此極爲重視。因鄉村之普遍建設，實爲我國生存發達之張本，而該計劃大綱之確立，則爲建設農村之初次工作。同時值此決戰期間，物資缺乏之現象，可以由於鄉村建設之成功，使生產增加，物資供應趨於圓滑，不僅可以安定民生，確保軍需，且可進而貢猷於大東亞戰爭，以分担建設東亞之重大責任</p>
<h3>鄕村建設　計劃大綱</h3>
<p>南京二十六日中央社電鄉村建設計劃大綢：　宗旨　我國民政府本年度施政重點爲「肅正思想，確保治安，增加生產」，此三者，本互相表裏，須合爲一體，使其同時並進。至着就輕重緩急程序言之，則應着重於增產……原因之最著者，約有下列六端：　農村治安不良。　各種武力團體對農民之苛索。　農產物價格採購方法及運銷上諸缺點。　地方行政上之諸多不備。　農民敎育之不澈底，及農民之無組織。　農業技術指導機關，與經濟助成機關之不振不備。現在欲革除此等原因，須從建設鄉村始。惟從事鄉村建設，始可以健全農村組織，建立一般田業發達，進而更可以關整都市與農村關係，培養民族社會實力，發揚文公，藉以確保中國今後之飛躍發展。中國目下最感痛苦者，乃物價之飛躍上漲，食糧生產之不足，廉潔政治之未能澈底施行，稅制之改革未臻妥善，和平統一未克早實現，現有軍隊將來如何使其解甲歸農，皆須俟鄉村建設普遍區域推廣，而後始可得到具有恒久性之根本解決。蓋欲澈底抑平物價，及減少食糧不足之病，須生產增大，生產物交流確保後。而始可勵行廉潔政治，實大有待於地方武力，及行政力之全般刷新。故改革稅制，須決先由購現物課稅雜稅等之整頓，故促成和平統一，實有賴於我國民政府統治下施行善政，用以增進其他地區民衆及其指導者，對我國民政府信賴，毅然自拔來歸。欲使軍隊解甲歸農，須確保鄕村治安。質言之，以上種重，均須俟鄉村建設設早底於成，而始可以逐一具體實現。且我國民政府行政力，及其參戰理念等，亦皆須力謀鄉村建設，而後始可滲透於中國民衆之間，此爲毫無疑義者。　實施要領按照我國目前形勢以及經濟發展階段，鄉村建設應以縣爲基本單位。省與中央負計劃調整及指導督促之責，分述於後：第一，選定寶騐縣，在攤村建設之經騐及指導力尚未成熟之先，應於三省一市各選定一縣爲實騐縣，使各方面之指導力，集中於此。根據實騐所得結果，而後逐漸改善，並漸次擴大。實騐縣區，甲，實騐縣選定之標準，選定實騐縣時，應特別注意左列諸點：　治安比較良好之處。　交通不特別感覺不便之處。　縣長對於鄉村建設事業有充份理解及熱意，且須廉潔者。　於農村靑年集團訓練之設施，能有獲得宿會農塲希望之處。　可能範國內，須合作社發達至相當程度之處，（乙）實騐縣之選定與縣長之任命，實騐縣之選定與實騐縣縣長之任命，由各省與中央政府主管部事先協議決定之，其任期爲三年。在任期中，如無特別重大過失不得免職，對治績卓越者，並得連任或特予奪將。（丙）實騐縣之督導，實騐縣之指導督勵，其第一次由省政府負責辦理之，中央政府得全省政府或與省政府協力實行指導督勵事務，同時企劃關於建設車業全般之述絡發展，並撥付相當補，助金由省政府轉發實騐縣。（丁）實騐縣之亞備，在實騐縣成立之先，由中央招集之各該縣縣長及幹部職員，實施關於鄉村建設及實騐縣建營理念，及方法之講習訓練。（未完）</p>
<h3>日機襲零陵　毀渝機十餘架　衡陽渝軍陷於孤絕</h3>
<p>中國戰綫某基地二十六日中央社電　日轟炸機隊，四日深夜更奇襲零陵機塲，擊破渝機六（架外，有兩架及其機塲倉庫等七處，中彈起火。按是日日轟炸機隊于暗夜中，飛担零陵上空，在渝軍猛烈之防空砲火中，作果敢之俯衝轟炸，即有小型機十八架以上，中彈燃燒，七處軍事設施亦遭痛炸。其滑走路已一時不能使用，渝美空軍企岡出動於衡陽戰塲，而由桂林遺來之此十數架飛機，已全被日機粉碎云。</p>
<p>里斯本二十六日中央社電　美聯社專慶特派員二十五日訊，湖南戰况如次：湖南戰錢日軍已逐漸壓縮對衡陽之包圍網，前來救援之渝軍，現尚未能突破日軍之包圍錢，故此繼續將及一月之衡陽戰鬥，現已漸至最後關頭，如果日軍攻陷衡陽，則重慶軍於該市東南之突出點，即將被却除，然後對現尚殘存於渝軍掌中之粵漢錢二百七十公里區間之攻擊，亦勢必開始。又該特派員對淒慘之衡陽作戰，曾叙述如次：據前綫消息，自六月二十五日以來之一月間，日軍為殲滅被包圍中之衡陽渝軍，曾集中砲擊，幷突入舊街市外側之新街市，更兩次突破城壁，突入舊街市內。渝軍於一個月中僅有兩次於西門城區突破包圍，被時曾與西方之救援部隊取得連絡。但至七月十日，已再度被日軍包圍。衡陽渝軍持有三月之食糧，其他武器彈藥及醫療品，亦得賴飛機補給云。</p>
<h3>社福部招待　首都記者團</h3>
<p>南京二十六日中央社電　壯會福利部於二十六日十五時，假南京聯歡社，招待首都中外記者，答覆記者問，茲誌如次：關於上海遊民勞動營籌備，現在進一步工作爲整頓第二步籌辦，經籌備會決定開辦費爲三千萬元，此項費用不擬向國府請求撥給，現僅有一千萬元業已確定，尚少二千萬元，擬在滬籌募，故開辦費可不成問題。現在預算先行假定收容一千名遊民，至勞動工作將以培殖農業爲主體。關於淮南煤礦公司生產工作，因工人數量太少，爲調整該公司工人數量起見，擬在江淮各地區設立勞工招募處負責招募工人。關於南京勞動服務工作狀况，南京國民義務勞動，第一項工作爲淸除市區內垃圾，確保市內淸潔，將來遂步推進。自六月十五日開始以來，迄七月十五日止，業已大部完成。在八月十四日左右，該兩區可以全部完成。</p>
<h3>各方亟盼取締　火車黑市票</h3>
<p>南京江十六日中央社電　華中鐵道前以旅客往來衆多，跑單幫者無處不有，而每日車票發售數量有限，致與交通運輸實際不敷遠甚。於是有不肖之徒，搶買車票，轉手黑市，每有超過車票三四倍者。其於正當旅客之交通影饗至鉅。刻有關當局會通令禁止，惟迄今此種現象，仍未能根絕。及華鐵公司內少數不良職員，利用職務便利，發售黑禁，此不僅於華鐵公司當局之令饗有關，且將影嚮正當旅客之交通，故望華鐵公司當局，速予整頓。同時建設部當局亦應切實負起督導賣任，務使此種不良現象，根本剷除。</p>
<h3>浙省恢復　警察總隊</h3>

<p>東京二十六日中央社電　迭尼安島詳細戰况如次：美軍奪取塞班島後，不斷對該方面日軍基地加強海陸雙方之攻擊，並暴露其在大宮島及迭尼安島登陸之企岡，二十日終於由兩處在大宮島登陸，對於迭尼安島則逐漸增加空襲次數，並調遣强力之機動部隊，接近該島，反覆施行猛烈砲擎，於是該島一帶之戰事驟然激化。二十二日下午，美軍登陸般，曾在該島西南部迭尼安港外從事偵察。二十三日晨，出動戰艦，巡洋艦，驅逐艦等約十艘，向該島進發，企圖在熾烈之砲火掩護下，於迭尼安港及該島西北部登陸，當地日軍部隊奮勇迎擊，毀其戰艦一艘，驅逐艦二艘，予以莫大損害，而將其擊退。對自西北方來製之美軍，曾兩度於水際將其擊退，但美軍增強兵力，併力攻擊，終於是日登陸，刻日軍部隊沉着迎擊，並施行夜襲，正激烈奮戰中。</p>
<p>中部太平洋基地二十六日中央社電　美軍於二十四。企圖在大宮島須磨方面登陸，先後計二次，均為該地日軍守備隊擊退。按敵軍先以登陸用舟艘二艘，戰事二十餘輛企圖登陸，被日軍擊沉舟艇一艘，擊毀戰車十一輛，餘均敗退，其後復以戰車登陸用舟艇二艘登陸，遭日軍猛烈反擊，其中一艘着火燃燒，另一艘遠遁，並於陌普拉方面，日軍在南北兩公里長之戰綫間，與敵軍登陸部隊形開激戰。二十四日敵美於該戰綫右翼以戰車五輛來襲，進至日軍陣地前數十米地點，其中三輛被擊燃燒，日軍仍確保第一錢陣地，並對漂泊於昭和灣方面之一萬噸敵運輸船猛予砲擊，結果船身傾斜，狼狽逃竄。</p>

<h3>杭州增高　敎育經費</h3>
<p>杭州廿六日中央社電　本市教育事業，年來甚為發達，惟因邇來百物高漲，教育員工，生計難以維持。市府為安定教師生活，一再提高待遇，故對於市教育文化經費，支出逐年增加，本年度下半年度，決再提高教職員待遇。聞下半年度杭市教育文化經費，支出總額為二五四〇六餘萬元，較諸上半年度增加一倍有奇，前項概算，一俟預算會議通過，即可實行云。</p>
<h3>促回敎徒團結　為獨立奮鬥　伊布拉西敎長談話</h3>

<h3>淮省設立　農事調查會</h3>
<p>森徐州二十六日中央社電　淮海省為適應戰時經濟體制，期達到復興農村，安定民生，及協力大東亞戰爭起見，特於省府之下，以建設應為中心，並連合全省各農業有關機關，設立淮海省農事調查會，業於昨二十五日在省府大禮堂正式成立。</p>
<h3>德增強國內陣綫　舉全力共赴國難　郭培爾任總動員統監</h3>
<p>柏林二十六日中央社電　德官方公布元首已任命郭培爾為總動員統監。茲誌元首命令大要如次：戰爭之情形，刻在積極要求傾盡武裝兵力及軍備之教力，故茲公表下列各點：　德國防協議會議長戈林元帥，為使生活適應於全面戰爭之所有要求，提議任命總動賈統監之職任，此統監得使一切公共集會，適合於全面的戰爭，並謀武裝兵力軍備不得受人力資源之影響。此外並計劃再度檢討鐵路郵務等公共機關及公共設施工塲，籍謀人員之量大節約。對於實行戰爭上不甚業要之各種活動，加以限制·或封鎖·或使其組織及方法簡捷化，以求最大限度之人力資源，供給予武裝兵力及軍需工業。　黨幹事長根據自身之權限，活用黨力，熱心支特余所命令之各項施策。</p>
<h3>郭培爾廣播</h3>
<p>柏林二十六日中央社電海通社訊：新任全面作戰督察專員郭培爾博士，定今日下午八時十五分（上海日光節約時間星期四上午二時十五分）發表廣播演說，約須四十五分鐘始能畢事。</p>
<p>柏林二十六日中央社電　德國總動員統監郭培爾博士，二十六日曾對國民廣播，闡明具體之緊急措置綱領。博士自被元首授與非常全權後，對於德國民公私生活期待其簡素化，亦即對於商業以至運輸公共集會文化生活等事，皆將加以整理。郭培爾博士，任柏林防衛長官時，在反軸心屢次之轟炸下，業以少數部下幹員實行一切適常之措置，博士就任統監後，亦必以少墾精說主義遂行重大任務。而德國民亦痛感國內情勞更有加強之必要，各報連日亦力說總動員之必耍，希特勒元首之非常施策公佈後，全國國民皆有戰至最後之意志，挺身協力同赴國難。</p>
<h3>外交活動　武力後盾</h3>
<p>柏林二十六日中央社電海通社訊：德政府將採取何種措施，俾得增強軍事行動，為目前柏林人士對諭之主要問題。德報評論昭示德國將成立堅強後備軍，德官方發言人昨曾提及德人民內部動員，以求勝利之嚴密措施。或問最近事態發展後，德外交政策是否將益見活動，答稱，德外交政策一向活動，本國與東南歐同盟國之國際關係尤為親密，彼此時常交換意見，調整步驟。德人深信軍事可以獲勝，徜若認為軍情不利，政治必須列於軍事之上，則為誤解矣。又問德之與國是否亦將採取增強國內活動之措施，答稱，關於戰事步驟，德國一向為與國之先導，不久事實將證明德國之新措施，可鼓勵與國起而效尤。</p>
<h3>新兵千萬　在訓練中</h3>
<p>里斯本二十六晶中央社電海通社訊，倫敦電合稱據諾曼第前綫被俘之德兵供稱，德國現在訓練中之新兵，共一〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇人，將於未來決戰時出動，其所受訓練與該德兵等赴前綫作虞前所受者相同。</p>
<h3>前綫將領　表示效忠</h3>
<p>柏林二十六日中央社電東綫德軍兩軍團司令莫迭艱元帥，二十五日致電希特勒元首，謂決效忠國家</p>
<h3>德陰謀案詳情　地毯下放置定時彈　會議室幾全部破壞</h3>
<p>柏林二十六日中央社電　於慕尼里會談時，德軍參謀總長培克上級上將及其他少數德軍將校，因不滿納粹黨對戰爭之指導，致起謀殺希特勒元首之念，本月二十日陸軍總司令部史都芬堡上校來訪問大本營之機會，乃於會議室之地毯下，放置定時炸彈，該炸彈於二十日下午一時許爆炸，但元首受火傷及擊傷，無關緊要。元首之打字貝爾格爾氏因受傷甚重，旋即逝世，德空軍參謀長柯坦上級上將及德軍作戰本部前任參謀白蘭特少將，負重傷後，至二十三日亦先後逝世。其他幕僚中，修姆特陸軍中將·魯克曼陸軍中校受重傷，尤多爾上級上將頭部負輕傷，布爾上將·波類希雅茲上將·謝爾天上將·霍希卡上將·奧茲海軍上將·希特卡美爾海軍上將等均受輕傷。雖發生以上不幸事件，但希特勒元首仍照豫定時刻，繼續與墨素里尼統帥舉行會談。其後據德國某報揭載之照片，被爆炸之會議室幾全部破壞，所有牆壁　柱等全毀，椅桌均壞，實戶玻瑙飛散，同時德元首行營恐國內一部通信機關為叛亂份十所佔用，故於事件發生四小時後，至下午五時四十分，即將經過情形發表。同時反動份十宣傳希特勒元首業被炸死，對此，元首乃於二十日深夜親自向國民廣播，可知元首無恙。　尼資提督等亦同樣發表廣播演講，痛烈抨擊不逞之行動，而對元首表示全面中心誠。</p>
<h3>美特使在西班牙　作秘密外交談判　史貝爾曼在聖城活動</h3>
<p>維希二十六日中央社電　海通社訊，此間外交界人士獲悉，羅斯福總統之密使社諾文，在瑪德里進行秘密談話，已有數星期之久，乃紛粉以羅斯福之秘密外交活動為談話資料。聞杜諾文現已返抵直布羅陀，渠在瑪德里時，居於美國大使館內，當杜氏在瑪德里時，白宮對於與杜諾文同時參加談判之人為誰，均嚴守秘密，常紐約大主教史貝爾曼正在梵蒂岡時，杜諾文方在瑪德里開始秘密談判。按杜諾文即係於一九四〇年為羅斯福設計侵略非洲之人，曾在阿爾及爾興魏剛將軍屢作長談，此次杜氏在瑪德里，是否希望覓取第二達朗，目前尚不得而知。中立方面人士認杜諾文與史貝爾曼均奉羅斯福之密令，為其謀取下次與邱吉爾談判時之勝券。</p>
<h3>德軍奮戰後　放棄羅勃林　蘇軍向維斯拉河推進</h3>
<p>柏林二十六日中央社電　海通社訊：羅勃林數目薄弱之德防軍，戰至最後一彈，始停止抵抗，該城被蘇軍圍攻多日，現蘇軍巳向羅斯拉河方面推進。</p>
<p>柏林二十六日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：東錢南翼戰事於週一蔓延至喀爾巴阡山前哨陳地，該處洪軍繫退或遏阻蘇軍在斯丹尼斯拉夫區之強大攻勢。林堡區亦再度為大戰之塲，德軍各處均固守其陣綫。敵對雅羅斯拉夫區與森河北岸之壓力愈形緊張，星期一日晚間敵經激戰後，在河之對岸建立狹小之橋頭堡若千處。中路德軍於前一日，在勃勒斯特里托夫斯克之西北所開始之攻勢行動，進行甚為順利，德機械部隊與裝甲部隊，向布格河進攻，掃湯敵橋頭堡數處。考那斯之東北，發生特別猛烈之戰事，該處之維爾科米爾市鎭經一塲惡戰後，德軍已予以放棄，敵迭次企圖竄入或撕裂德軍陣綫之企圖，均遭挫折。</p>
<h3>培克上將　主謀罪犯</h3>
<p>更據二十日夜之第二次發表稱：陰謀團首魁於計劃失敗後，即行自殺，培克上將己被槍決，此次事件大致已告解決，叛逆份十之卑鄙計劃，卒成畫餅，德情報部長眞達曼博士，已於二十一日發表培克上級土將逝世消息，按培克大將乃德國有數之優秀參謀，關於作戰之著述頗多，今日哈爾特大將等德軍首腦，悉曾受大將之薰陶，然因反對防共協定，一九三八年八月里賓特洛甫就任外長後，乃行辭職。由於以上種種關係，曾有擴大宣傳此次事件之背景者，然由於德政府之閃電措置，德國始終極其平靜，反相信元首之得免於難，實為神明加護所致，故戰意愈形旺盛。柏林市內於二十日黃昏在市中心出動軍隊約六小時之久，幷在市內衝要地點，架設機槍，預備由德兵遮斷交通，一時頗形緊張，偶一觀之似為搜查民宅，而街頭行人，仍與警備隊談笑自如，又自二十一日以來，德國內已趨平靜。</p>
<h3>蘇聯壓迫下　保嚴守中立　德軍退出保境</h3>
<p>布達佩斯二十六日中央社電　保加利亞政府此次得德政府之諒解，據傳已雖立如下二方針：即　對據蘇兩國問戰爭嚴守中立，　與土耳其政府調整外交關係。按保國此次確立此項方針，幷非為脫離軸心陣綫之表示，實乃基於德政府之諒解，外交政策之一轉換而已。蓋由於最近東綫戰局之新進展，蘇聯對於保國　之壓迫政策憶逐步加緊，德國又基於全面戰局，不得不將貴重之兵力轉用其他戰綫，同時為緩和蘇聯之壓迫計，故承認保國此種嚴守中立之方針。基於情勢之轉變，黑海沿岸之瓦魯綱與布爾克斯兩港防備主力，最近已由德軍之手交與保軍，幷解除該地燈火管制之警備。</p>
<h3>對蘇要求　委婉答覆</h3>
<p>又據安加拉美聯社訊：蘇政府曾威嚇保政府，要求德軍自保國之海空軍基地急速撤退，否則即將對保官戰，保政府不得已方始於原則上承認之。又索菲亞電稱，保政府於德政府同意下，對蘇聯於瓦魯納·布爾克兩港內設置領事館之要求，作婉轉答復，幷對艱聯政府要求如下：　蘇聯政府要求條件，予以相當猶豫期問，　對保加利亞國內停止共黨宣傳。據傳駐索菲亞蘇聯公使館當局對此熊度已頗表好轉</p>
<h3>土保兩國　友誼增進</h3>
<p>艱於保加利亞與土耳其政府之接近，固然係基於德政府之支持，但一方亦實由於蘇聯對土政府之壓迫，方使土保兩國易於接近，美英兩國對土實施經濟絕交之前數日，即有土保通商協定之成立，此亦可謂促進土保接近之一原因。總之，實際上保政府利用土耳其以防止反軸心軍之侵入，土政府則由與中立化之保政府協力，可強化自國中立之傾向，籍以避免及推却蘇美英三團之要求參戰。</p>
<h3>諾曼第前綫　展開大戰　敵聯合攻勢無時展</h3>
<p>柏林二十六日中央社電　德國新聞社訊，軍息：星期二晨英第二軍結集空前大量之物力，於克恩以南及東南狹小陣地，發動大規模之攻勢，其凶猛之程度當日即已增加。德方已料及此次之攻勢而有謹愼之準備，故即刻反攻甚為得手，英軍僅於德軍陣地中某一處形成一缺口，其最深處為三·五公公里（在聖安特及波加布之間）。梅索昂尼之南第八十八號高地之東北，英軍被反攻之德軍過阻，德軍仍確保克恩－法萊斯公路，由此而通過奧納河直至美第一防區，英軍並未能改變陣綫。波加布之西陣綫亦無變動美軍攻柯坦丁半島之東翼，亦已發展至大規模之攻勢，但於狹窄之地區中，獲得甚小之進展，德軍刻正大艦反攻中。</p>
<h3>佛羅倫斯南　德軍後衛戰</h3>
<p>柏休二十六日中央社電　德國新聞社訊，軍息：于義境英美軍於星期二開始於佛羅倫斯以南之地區中，發動已被料及之大規模攻勞，敵軍特別着重襲攻由波傑朋希及蒙特法傑通至佛城之公路，德軍殿後部隊遏阻敵軍一切之突擊，經激戰後，即依照計劃向北與敵解脫。</p>
<h3>蘇聯宣稱　與波蘭復交</h3>
<p>瑞典京城二十六日中央社電　海通社訊，莫斯科電台稱：蘇聯與波閣已恢復外交關係。該電合未曾指出係與何地之波蘭政府復交，大約係指莫斯科之波蘭解放委員會而言</p>
<h3>海軍戰略的動態</h3>
<p>— 菱秋</p>
<p>占據塞班島的美海軍，在信口自誇了。他們宣傳道，以美海軍在中國大陸登陸，進迫日本本土，有如反掌之易。但拿英美自大柬亞戰爭以來失敗的地方，與現在收復的地方比較起來，現在的情况，僅如九牛之於一毛。以此就能够侈言海軍作戰已迫近勝利嗎？這不過是在大東亞戰爭的緒戰中，受日海軍先制攻擊的零落殘缺的艦隊之重建而已。不足驚異。這狀能在開戰前已經知道了。</p>
<p>島嶼歟？軍艦歟？</p>
<p>德國的戰爭論者克勞塞維曾說，因戰爭為遂行國策的一手段，故為戰爭之一分子的武力戰之目的；「乃誘致使敵國人民考慮媾和比繼續戰爭為有利的狀態」。是以海軍作戰的目的，乃在扼制地球上最大，最廣的交通路綫——海洋；管至並支配海洋上的交通聯絡，在敵國的政治，軍事，經濟，思想上給與致命的打擊，而毀滅其機能。那制海機的獲得，是海軍作戰的主要目的。</p>
<p>故如美海軍所誇稱：占據塞班島在海軍作戰上獲得決定的勝利，如果有人相信這話，那眞是可笑的誤解。占據一島嶼，其結果推進了艦隊並飛機的基地。是以無論占據那一個島嶼，也就是獲得了附近二三千公里的制海權。但假使日本艦隊出動，驅除美艦隊，再奪還島嶼，則這制海權即成泡影，每將尼米資亦確認：「日本艦隊尙完會健在」，在此情形下，如何能以塞班島的奪取誇傳為海軍作戰的勝利呢？</p>
<p>為獲取治海權，雜持制海權的必要方法與手段，除擊滅敵主力艦隊以外，別無他道。</p>
<p>機動歟？決戰歟？</p>
<p>海軍作戰主要目的的敵主力艦隊之擊滅，談何容易。這不單在此次戰爭中，即在日俄戰爭中亦然。例如那有名的明治三十七年二月的一役中，對敵遠東艦隊的根據地旅順港，雖施以夜襲，砲擊，封鎖，機雷攻擊，並繼之以封鎖港口，用盡種種方法，尚不能使敵艦隊潰滅，尤以八月十日，曾在洋上邀擊大舉出擊的敵遠東艦隊，而擊破之，而獲致黃海戰的捷報，但靠這補助作戰中的勝利，尙不能確保眞正的制海權。直待擊破從波羅的海遠涉重洋而來的俄國主力艦隊以後，日本始能確保勝利。</p>
<p>在這中間，日本的第二艦隊司令長官上村中將的鄕居，遭遇投石事件，為國民的不理解所苦。</p>
<p>對於海軍作戰上補助作戰的動向而乍憂乍喜，不是笨事。敵人進迫塞班島，如其能夠利用這良機而實施艦的漸減作戰，自日佳事。日本亦稱之為出血戰術，果能漸次造成敵艦隊的潰滅，可說充分完成了補助作戰的目的。</p>
<p>決戰否耶？</p>
<p>以大東亞戰爭與日俄戰爭比較起來，在海軍作戰上。在下面諸點有非常的不同。</p>
<p>第一是戰塲的廣大。日俄戰爭中海軍作戰的主要戰塲僅限於黃海及日本海。然大東亞戰爭則在世界最大的海軍太平洋及印度軍的大半，各方面滿佈着戰略的要域，海軍兵力亦分散配置於各方面，結果，欲獲得傾雙方兵力以舉行主力艦隊決戰的機會，非常困難。</p>
<p>第二，由於飛機，潛水艦，電波探知器等近代武器的發達，海上作戰的性質變化了。日俄戰爭時代，祗使用水上艦艇的海戰，現在加上了空中戰，永中戰，變成立造化了。其結果，因飛楊利用其速度，在艦隊進入決戰以前即得以襲擊敵艦隊，故眞正的艦隊決戰轉形困難。又由於電波探知機的出現，艦隊行動從遠在數萬里之外，亦能獲悉，故知道視綫外敵艦隊的動態而不利於決戰的艦隊，事先即能迴避，故艦隊決戰愈益成為不可能。</p>
<p>第三，美國與日俄戰爭時的俄國不同，在政治，經濟·思想上亦無致命的動搖，並無希求早日決戰以挽救反戰，厭戰思想的橫行並國內不安的深刻化之情事。故艦隊決戰不能迅即實現。</p>
<p>機動戰是什麽？</p>
<p>但這裏所應注意者，即美海軍的動向，己表面化了。那就是今春以來美海軍的機動作戰。例如，美海軍何故敢於深入日本海軍內綫，在塞班島並大宮島（關島）實行登陸戰呢？此在一方面，美政府當局因欲在大選之有，以好虞思想給與動搖中的美國國民，而謀戰局之有利的展開，焦慮之狀，無可掩飾。而在加一方面，我們必須想到樹立美海軍基本戰略的史漢少將之夢。</p>
<p>據馬漢戰術：「如欲常握制海權，應保持局地的優勢，常以攻擊臨敵。」用戰艦十餘艘，航空母艦二十餘艘等，組成第五十八機動部隊，進迫塞班島一孤島，他們的企圖，也就是追求那史漢的夢。史漢而說：「要擊破敵艦隊而確保制海權，應衝襲敵所發急要的地方，使敵艦隊陷於非救援不可的狀態，而邀擊之於目己所希望的洋上。」</p>
<p>美艦隊以為塞班島是臼本所最急要的地方，一面加以急要，同時，另一方面即欲邀擊日本艦隊的出動，整備自已所最希望態勢，而嚴陣以待。對此，晶本聯合艦隊僅令其一部出擊，由飛機發動先制攻擊，獲得偉大戰果，而使漸减作戰成功，同時，使史漢的夢成為泡影。</p>
<p>當然，這是美國海軍當局的誤解，以為沒有大型機塲，也沒有充分軍港設備的塞班島一孤島是日本的要地，以致此，然日本海軍慎重地向最後勝利邁進的戰略之優秀性，亦不能不加贊佩。</p>
<p>但關於大宮島如何？對此疑問，擬暫守沈　，留待讀者考慮。</p>
<p>決戰條件是什麽？</p>
<p>綜上所論，可以歸納為二個問題，即日本艦隊容忍美機動間隊蠢動到什麼地步，在那裹決戰？</p>
<p>這裏不能不想到，與陸軍作戰一樣，在海軍作戰上，地形亦為重要的要素。</p>
<p>第一次世界大戰之先，德國為推進其世界政策而努力建造強大的艦隊時，當時的英海軍大臣邱吉爾嘲笑謂：「僅以你們的海軍艦隊，尚不能稱為海軍力。你們的世界政策，等於立在粘土之上」。果然，德國海軍在第一次世界戰爭中，向主要戰塲大西洋的出擊被阻，僅能在次要的戰塲北海及波羅的海活動。這是德國專顧整頓艦隊，而忘卻了海上權力的另一要素戰略地形的結果。地形在海上作戰中是如此的重要。</p>
<p>所謂戰略的地形者，在海軍作戰上意義是什麽呢？</p>
<p>第一，有着適當的海軍根據地之聯繫。美海軍不直接從夏威夷進迫塞班島，而費了很大的犧牲占據瑪金·達拉瓦等小島者，其原因可說在獲得海軍根據地，占據塞班島亦可視為建設海軍根據地。</p>
<p>第二，我必須在內綫，而使敵人在外綫。在必要的地點，必要的時候，常能集中優勢兵力，作先制攻擊，便有勝算的把握。</p>
<p>且內綫作戰因後方聯絡運輸路綫短捷，故有安全而迅速之利。日軍的從瓜達爾加納爾島轉進，德軍的從莫斯科縮短戰綫的重大原因，也因為伸得過長的補給綫之故。</p>
<p>如上所述，何國的海軍占得內綫的優勢，何國的海軍為維持過長的補給綫而苦惱，請攤開地圖來研究一下。美第五十八機動部隊宣稱能離開基地繼續作戰行動達數屋期之久。但研究太平洋上的往來的距離，顯出在作戰上受着很大的限制。但再說下去，屬於戰略上的機密，決完日美二國之興廢的艦隊決戰塲，何處對日有利，不能明示。這事甚至於也可說是有關大東亞十億人民的將夾，請諸君自行想像吧！</p>
<p>尤其在飛機發達的今日，能够使從陸上基地飛來，大型而航續時間悠久，搭載大量炸彈的飛機參加海戰，是最好的條件。漢視此條件，不能考慮艦隊決戰。關於此點，美軍當局會稱：航空母艦有移動性，攻擊性，是優秀的。</p>
<p>但航空母艦的搭載量大型的約百架，小型的僅數十架，如再遇日本空軍神技般的俯衝雷擊，轉瞬即告擊沉。故美海軍的話，不過是欲據艦被日本占領許多島嶼的美海軍之弱態的宣傳上言辭。</p>
<p>來到何處？</p>
<p>佔據塞班島的美將尼米資曾聲稱，因日本艦隊今尙建在，故預料今後尙須經數次激戰，但猶誇口證以美海軍力北上進迫日本本土，或西下登陸中國大陸，均易如反掌。但實際上，旣不北上，又不西下，反自二十一日以來在天宮島再度展開登陸戰。由此不難想像，寒班島之戰略的地位，出乎他們的預料，是怎樣的　小，又向馬利亞納羣島以外的作戰，是怎樣的困難。這裏說明了美軍方面伸展的補給綫之不鞏固。但這裹不能不注意者，內綫陣營的日本，雖說有着確守制海權的海域，但時間上，空間上，亦不能斷言美海軍的通過是不可能的。</p>
<p>制海權者，不是在海上築有金城湯池之鐵壁。亦不是用堅固的鐵鐀設定勢力範圍，不使敵人走近一步。戰塲是沒有山，沒有谷，沒有河，沒有路的廣漢的大六，其勢力範圍最多不過不容適自由活動的程度而已。是以其效果亦不是絕對不動的，而是在時間上，空間上不免有多少動搖的相對的東西。這與制空權相似。上海上空完全在日本的制空權下，是絕對不答敵機自由亂飛的地方。但要說不容有一機侵八，這在天空的性質上，飛機的性能上，是不可能的。</p>
<p>故美軍縱占據塞班島，登陸大宮島，轟炸小笠原島及硫黃島，報復不是絕對不可能的。祗要日本海軍今尚完全健全，確信勝利是關於日本的，那東亞民族的</p>
<p>美軍將進攻何處呢？美軍進攻到何處時，日本艦隊始出動挑戰吸？此尙不明，國父孫中山先生在關於大亞細亞的講演中曾指示：「如亞細亞九億居民一致團結結來應付，決不會敗於歐洲四億的少數人」</p>

<h3>一面推進作戰　一面積極建設　出淵部長談湖南現狀</h3>
<p>盟邦上海　車報導部出淵部長，此次特赴湖南前線視察，始於日前　，昨（二十六）日下午三時，該部循例舉行之報導常會，出淵部長亦躬親偕同赤星　托準時　會，撞見本市中國新聞記者，即席由出淵部長就此行在湖南戰線視察所見，發表談話如次：</p>
<p>衡陽戰況</p>
<p>出淵部長首謂：本人此次赴湖南前線視察，所見在日軍進駐下之和平區一般狀況，善於衡陽之兩頭，一部分由日軍部隊加以佔領外，自本月十五日起，又開始更積極列猛烈之攻擊，　已沿汀江江岸進擊，情形頗為順利，頃已進抵衡陽市街之一隅太子碼頭。本月二十一日晨，日軍又猛烈攻擊渝薜岳所派遣衡陽之援救軍，已將在衡陽西方邀擊南方，另從南方而下之日軍，亦在衡陽西方邀擊該軍，是以目前之渝薜岳援救軍，已正背被擊在茲情形之下無力　　。又本月二十日左右由太太向南推進之日軍五十軍慘敗部隊，加以殲滅之中。此外，在荼陵方面之日軍，亦已向遁走西方山地之渝三十七軍慘敗部隊，予以殲滅，已於二十二日　推進至安仁。總之，在衡陽四週慘敗渝軍均成為　中之　，無法重振，已遭受殲滅之命運，其整個消滅，公為時間上的問題。</p>
<p>人民來歸</p>
<p>出淵部長繼謂：關於從岳洲至衡陽之公路，及岳洲至長少之公路，多半遭渝軍敗走時摧毀，尤以岳洲與半遭渝軍敗走時摧毀，尤以岳洲與長少一　為甚，幫稍為困苦。惟日軍一方在推進作戰上，一面又積極從事建設，在急捷的工程下，已逐步予以修復，獲得助力非淺。查日軍對於運輸路線恢復工作，費了相當的努力，及下最大之苦心，且每一修路附近之鄉民，均赤　為日軍貢獻一切，並且願協力，故在修復之工作上。亦獲得頗大之幫助。其次，長少附近之兩頭，當地人民已陸續來歸，足以反映治安上建設上的進展，且歸返人民日益增加，最多的一日約有一千婁百餘名。如市內情形，一般大的商店雖未恢復，而普通商店乃已逐漸複業，井有日僑方面新設店鋪頗多，確信在短期內，市容明朗繁榮。當初長沙開展作戰時，該地居民避難，並不過遙，均避居附近村落，生活情形頗為安定，此次重歸故鄉時，簡便異常，且該處日軍，在作戰行動四及建設行動上，均遵照初中最高指揮官司之意旨，當地人民深為安心，且熟讀抄寫日軍最高指揮官之安民佈告，轉告一般華人，幫該處民眾莫不對日軍深切信賴，井至誠協力。</p>
<p>生活安定</p>
<p>關於情形，農民安心種植稻穀，郊外碧綠一片，殊為豐年之兆，故在建設及治安之逐步恢復下，本來面目已大部復原，深信今秋以後，更為明朗，且有新的姿態更生。同時該地米價微賤，僅千三百元，較上海最高時米價相較，祇抵十分之一強而已。醒湖南自經日軍進領後，各該地由「抗戰」化為和平區，一切設施，更的明朗的超出往昔，鄉民無不歡忻雀躍，介為在渝美空軍之一貫慘無人道的野蠻行為下，恒擾亂偵察，甚至向不重要之村落盲目轟炸，雖未有多大損害，其無辜傷害平民，益使該地民眾對之唾棄。</p>
<p>補給通暢</p>
<p>最後出淵雙詳述補給線之縮短，及打通延長戰線上有頗大之價值，且在作戰上之使得良非　　，故補給線之溝通，以縮短距離，不但有利，於作戰且更可圓滑暢通，惟敵美在南太平洋之戰略　　，我人估計彼　在全盤戰局上，已極為不利，其本身在地勢上。如補給線　拖長，其作戰更遭困獸難雲雲。</p>

<p>短評</p>
<h3>無場與節電</h3>
<p>本市電力供給，將自下月起再度普還限制。電車行駛，亦將養活車輛與次數。電力限制的原因，是為煤斤來源短少，是原料不足的問題，也可以說不得已的消極辦法。我們一面希望當局竭力設法疏運煤斤以外，一面對於電力，不得不希望再加合理的關整。</p>
<p>怎樣調整呢？生產業應不減或少減。生活消耗（如電訊電熨斗電冰箱等）及娛樂場所等；應減至最小限度或絕對禁用。</p>
<p>跳舞場是娛樂場所之一，在此戰時根本就不應存在，而本跳舞場大小林立，依然鼎盛，已屬不可思議。自上次電力限制後，各舞場限令十一時後不準備營業。但聞　西區尚有若干處舞場，依然營業至大明四時，顯然違反法令。為什麼滬西警務當局不予取締？如果說該舞場逾時營業，已得特准，未悉該管當局根據什麼法令予以特准？</p>
<p>在此再度節電聲中，我們希望此等不合理現象。從速取締，從速消　。</p>

<p>國民論壇</p>
<h3>農村耕牛缺乏　戽水大感困難</h3>
<p>在戰事以前，鄕村農戶，每十家，總有四家，自己擁用耕牛，輪流僱用，足夠維持抽水工作。然時至今日，他們因為生活所迫，差不多將相依為命的耕牛，都被變賣了。吾鄕浦東，因為耕牛缺乏之故，每一頭牛，總要耕種六十畝之多，實在不敷輪流，於是十分之七八的稻田，因無法戽水，田中泥土，都呈龜裂之象。如果不謀挽救，聽其自然，那末禾苗枯槁，秋收一定無望。到那時候，農民所受損失，眞是不堪設想。旁的不說，單就豆餠一端而論，目下每張需費一千一百五十元，其他肥田粉以及工料等等，尙不在內，農民將何以為生？故亟盼當局，迅籌對策，搶救農村，不獨農民之幸，亦民食前途之福也。（陳　昌）</p>
<h3>杜絕電車賣票員　舞弊之建議</h3>
<p>電車賣票員之手揩油問題雖經公司當局屢次設法改良制止。但揩油之風依然未減，其根本辦法當然要請公司方面盡量提高賣票之薪水，至少便能維持最低之生活。假如在加薪後仍有舞弊行為者不妨採用下列各種對策：</p>
<p>提高車票，頭三等一律五元，但已用過之頭等廢票可至售票處找回現鈔二元，三等廢票則可找回現鈔三元半（此等廢票換鈔票或可請各大烟紙號代理之。）</p>
<p>關於電力之查票問題，公司方面可程請保甲委員會合作，在車站附近之自警團員當乘客下車時有檢查其車票之義務。乘客如無車票者須補買之。賣票員如有舞弊者須記其號碼報吿電車公司嚴辦之。這樣乘客下車時必須要有車票。賣票員當然無從施其技。</p>
<p>車票之價格雖可以一律，然票面之顏色不可不分。且須註明乘客下車時之站名，以便檢查而杜流弊。（蔡禮雍）</p>
<h3>對於「廢劵貼花」的意見</h3>
<p>閱七月廿五日國民論壇有將廢劵貼花補助敎育基金之建議。筆者略有意見，抒述如下：</p>
<p>破損法幣若需貼花，各商店在交易時收受法幣，必儘量挑剔，而對於將近破損而尙未破損之法幣足不予收受，如何辦法？蓋法幣在輾轉收付之際，無形破捐，稍一不愼，豈非白受捐失，商店所持之理由也對。</p>
<p>貼花後之破損劵流通與不流通瓿，兩者均有困難，若仍流通，而所貼之紙質印花再度破捐，如何辦法？若不流通，市民如有少量或小數之掉換，其所得之値尙不償車資，市民寗願棄去，兩相損失。</p>
<p>國家銀行每日收受之待查劵究有多少，必須仔細調查淸楚，以免得不償失，若稅率過高，市民損失多，流幣也多。</p>
<p>欲實行廢劵貼花，必須克復上述困難之點。（忠作忠祈）</p>
<h3>科學技術座談會</h3>
<p>備藤：是的。我們就是按照這個方法進行的。試看各方面所研究的結果，例如全國科學技術聯合會方面，聽到研究的結果報告出來的時候，就可以知道這一點。他們問，怎樣就可以使我們的工作現實化，凡是能使用者，立刻就被採用。請再看一個例子，是數天前決定的事情，海軍方面在從事各方面的某一部長就來對我說，海軍方面在從事這種研究，好像是很可以用的。按你的意見，是否可以立刻適用於現實工作上。既然得到一個通知，命我檢查一下是否適用，要給一個確實回答，所以立刻就加以檢查試驗，結果非常適用。那末好，立刻就採用吧！和軍需省商量一下，就給從業者下命令吧！在這個期間，請幫忙！這一件事情業已有兩　期了。那至少對於戰力增強，是非常有效果的研究。聽到那種結果，立刻在兩星期內就搬到生產機關去了。在我們看來，至少所研究的結論，並不需要很多霎時和能達生產機關的，自然，立刻就會想辦法，對於增強力有所貢獻。實在是按照戰時方法進行的。這就是在我們專門進行的統制會內，所必然走的前途，而其他以企業為主要前途，那是另一件事。一般說來，現代的企業家也往往按國定的要求，進行研究，所以並不是先用算嚴打算一下是否有利，然後才施之於企業上的，遵守命令，如果所研究的成果，是必要的，對於國家是必要的，那末就去生產，不管需要多少設備和資本。是許可後就要實行的，所以這種研究的結果，專門家估計有充分實際化可能的時候，就毫不猶豫，立刻搬到生產機關去。</p>
<p>試驗研究命令與生產化研究</p>
<p>花田：對於技術院的工作，最簡單者是就接受發明計　。收到後，也有立刻轉交軍部的，同時簡單者，則立刻出錢命令製造實物。稍微規模大者，就以試驗研究命令，命令著手研究。同時，由於去掉的機構改革，而新產生出生產技術部來，而生產化研究也曾耗費了許多金錢。因此，試驗研究的對象，　或轉交到企業家手裏，也需要加以發揮光大，是有冒險性的，因為或許不能生產。凡是對於國家必要的，都要支出相當　項進行生產的。對於軍需省的軍需公司法案，出賜與這樣的權限，所謂先　工場，或冒險工場，凡企業家不願動手者。都由政府的津貼和補助，而不斷加以生產。近來成了統制經濟，　令一個人發明了一件好的東西，想取得資材從事製造，也是一件很不容易的事。所以如無政府那樣後盾，是絕對辦不到的。　或企業家有意作，但目前環境也有所不能。同時，現在成立了一種體制，　　或企業家無意作，假如是重要的事情，也強迫他作。這種範圍，我們認為應該是這樣的。老實說，研究這悠揚事情，就是播種和芽，自然，生芽後就把他移植到山上去，但如認為芽已出來，立刻就移植到山上去，往往有很多會死掉的。總而言之，仍然還需要在苗圃裏培養一個相當時期。這樣東西是在苗圃培養的。生產化研究應該在苗圃內培養一個相當時期，等到枝葉長得堅固後，才能移植到山上去的。此外也有不培養在苗圃裏，而立刻直接在山上培養出來的。關於播種方面還有稍微困難的地方，那就是政府方面的困難。因為需要預算，也需要買到資材。在我們所研究的大者，就立刻與軍需省或陸海軍取得接觸，以便試作。因為大家都非常的熱心，且系統不亂，所以一定會一帆風順的。</p>
<p>：關於方才　的話，我們方面在統制會所研究的，再用統制會的力量製造出來，是不充分的，另外統制會用全力作尚有不可能的問題，只好交與技術院，而把我們的研究，再加以試作，或使之能生產化。一般技術員動手作的工作，並不問這是為統制會，也不問這是為研究團體，即是為國家，大家就應當協力下手作。</p>
<p>稻村：在這樣條件上，最初的研究者，是否從試作到最後的生產，都要始終跟著走呢？抑還是生產時，就與研究者無關了呢？</p>
<p>花田：兩種情形都有。</p>
<p>稻村：我曾從一個服務於公司的朋友聽到一個故事，過於拘泥於形式主義，而研究部，試作部，生產機關三者，各自成為獨立的機構，所以一個工作轉交試作部，由試作部再轉交生產，在這種情形上，最初的研究者，如跟　一直到最後中，則效率非常大，且極細微的地方也可以注意到。如交與別外的人作，則回不明瞭最初研究者的動機，往往任意變更，結果把主要弄錯，以致試作遲延，或工業化脫期，這是事上難免的</p>
<p>花田：最近在處理一個問題，就是想從日本資源中生產日本所沒有的資源。這是某一研究所埋頭苦幹的一件工作。去掉的夏天開始研究，而現在業已得出答案來了。這立到由研究動員會議受理，研究動員會議後就開始工作，然而這個研究所是沒有工場所應血的條件的。所以這個研究所的前此研究，過了所謂山坡後，前面就只剩一條道路了。在工業方面是需要某種寬道的，所以就可以知道前此從有偏右或偏左的事情發生，也會出了常軌，材料從有變更，也必須按著這個目的生產下去。這樣工作，在研究所中不斷地作下去。即如是，就以研究所的人為中心，同時命令其他公司實行生產，於是就全部使用工場的即存社備，另外再補充不足的地方，一時一刻也要爭取，儘量提前移到和產上去。在這上面仍然還有工場上的問題，固然可笑，然而未知數尚非常的多。那就跟具有工場各種條件的去作。於是就以公司的人為中心來作，　研究所的人就參加到這個地方來，同時公司派人到研究所裏來作。公司方面也就不再估計合算不合算的問題，而外則政府補助資材或其他物品，而從事生產。假如研究成果物品一度出現後，則立刻由技術院交與軍需省</p>
<p>大橋：現在我要說幾句離題稍遠的話，根據衝動員法，頒佈試驗研究全集時，從業者雖然支出莫大的一筆研究費，但政府的獎勵金很省，且只是按其向政府所作的報告書，而補償共經營費及人事費的。此外大多數工場，並不具有試作工場，於是就把試作品和生產品混淆到一起，以致試作幾種多的工場，就一落千丈，而在企業方面，就是一個相當大的負擔。所以如不建立一個具有國家意義的企業，則委有可能不熱心從事試驗研究。我主人為國家應當有獨立的度作工場。很少優秀技術家的今天，　然對於多數工場發出試驗研究命令，但因難於完成歙珠工場很多，就會一再拖延招待，所以我認為把優秀技術家都動員到國家的試作工場來，這種方法最好。假如這種試作工場不能立刻實現的話，至少也要把從業者方面的優秀技術家組成一個報國團之類的組織。隨時都能幫助接到試驗研究命令的工場，我主為這樣也可以。</p>
<p>花田：在試驗研究期間，也有總動員試驗研究命令，同時還有不如此緊張的委託研究。也有極簡單的委託形式。此外一直到與工場無大差別的，與企業無大差別的生產化研究。其間自然有各種階段。所以必須按客觀形勢，而採取適當　置，在這一點上是一種官　，所以我認為非常方便。</p>
<p>局部改良的必要與獎勵</p>
<p>稻村：在創意課會產出許多偉大的結果來　？</p>
<p>花田：會有過相當有意義的事。我雖然沒有聽到一切的事情，但其中手續麻煩的，也沒發生阻力，凡是有興趣者，都會一個一個地交與陸海軍方面。</p>
<p>大橋：在德國為了城市中的發明家，而組織專資公會，努力使新實用計畫企業化，關於專　原料問題，也在　旋從業者等，勿使發生糾紛。假如一起糾紛，就以公會內的調解裁判缺席加以解決。裁判是由專　特許局的官吏，公會長，以及糾紛者同業中之一個理事，三人組成　的，這樣就可以加以適當的處理。</p>
<p>稻村：只要對於一般事情加以努力，認為能有新物發生就夠了。在實際的生產機關內，往往從局部改良運動中產生有意義的結果。在生產機構內，前此所忽略的微細改良，這據說都會得到很好的成績。所以局部的改良，也是非常有意義的。</p>
<p>花田：局部改良出現時，如素質良好，就由於獎勵金制度，也能引導局部改良。走向好的方向。</p>
<p>大橋：生產機構內初等獎勵局部改良政策，會有時候對於優秀的改良，就賜與獎學金，使其子弟得入大學。目前釣魚業憶不能鼓舞勞動者努力工作的時候，而用獎學金方法，煽動起對子弟的教育熱，以備將來效勞國家，這真是一舉兩得的好辦法。</p>
<p>記者：統制會方面，在這樣場合採取何種具體方法呢？</p>
<p>備藤：在統制會方面，是在小規模地進行著。（未完）（季　目四月號日本　論）</p>

<h3>決戰階段下的　日本戲劇動向　大山功</h3>
<p>充滿着國家性</p>
<p>再需要說的，就是戲劇內農富地注入或保持國家性和共同性這個現象。原來戲劇（固然不單限於戲劇）含有國家性和共同性，這是理所當然的事，但在過去的資本主義或自由主義時代的戲劇體制，則決不如此，事實則正相反，他們認為有錢可賺，任何劇本都可以上演，縱使對國民精种含有毒素的劇本，也不妨上演，這就是此種演劇態度，並不顧到國家和民族的利益。不容許這種態度的存在，縱在承平時代也是應當的，何况今日這樣愈演愈烈的決戰階段呢，當然更用不着任何贅言的</p>
<p>就是這種關係，因為時局的吃緊，而此種態度逐漸開始受到非難和指責，因於關係電局的積極統制和指導，以及演員的自覺，所以過去的瑕疵，逐次肅淸，尤其在寶行非常措置後，這種肅淸運動愈益加強了。前而講過的流劇團之成立及其活動，也全一改前非，此外不久前，地方農村和織山工塲等內盛極一時的厚生劇團業餘演員運動，也可以說按正確方向在前進着。這兩種運動，都是否認戲劇中的個人性和營利性的，戲戲的目的在於慰藉人民，提拱藝衛，宣傳國策，啓發文化等，至於上述的國家性和共同性，當然也是戲劇所應有的態度</p>
<p>大都市的職業劇團</p>
<p>關於大都市的職業劇團的這種傾向，也逐漸因統制而強化了，但在非常措置令上很淸楚的指出這一方向，而強制要求其就範。在非常措置後的今天，在一部份的人間，高談闊論着國粗管理戲劇，團體管理戲劇等問題，以及設立戲劇團策公司，戲劇營團等問題，道顯然是證明想要採取強制手段的。</p>
<p>這一問題，特別按今日主觀和客觀形勢來看，只是深深感覺到微妙和困難，而關係官應甚至尚未發表任何積極性的指示說明，竟徘徊躊躇於慎重態度裏。但今日這樣演劇形態，當然不允許其繼續存在，而必須加以改革。</p>
<p>國民戲劇創造</p>
<p>現在再談一下目前戲劇的革新方面。這在積極方面，戲是創造設建立國民數劇，在消極方面，就是科正現代戲劇的城市性，西歐性，頹廢性，　壓性，消費性等等的缺陷。前者遠在數年前，業巳有一部先知先覺的戲劇家曾提倡過，不久前遙一命題業已成為戲劇家及文化人全體的一致要求。現在以情報局為中心的官廳，以及其他周圍團體的文化組織，開始努力嘗試了。</p>
<p>換言之，情報局每年拿出巨賞來鼓勵所有劇團參加國民戲劇義賽，而表彰和獎賞優秀作品。日本文化中央聯盟，在稱為各種大衆戲朗的一切團體問，曾懸賞競賽過，同時收獲到相當有藝術價值的成績。這二者，對於國民生活加以慰安，且與以無上的精神力，思想則以日本式的世界觀為基準，藝術則創造具有日本古典戲劇傳統的優秀戲劇。同時，也要努力辦理陸海軍，軍事保護院以及其他官廳所發動的這種直接提高戰意，增加生產等的政治性國民戲劇。</p>
<p>上演時間調整</p>
<p>後者就是內務省和警視廳實行劇本檢查，演出檢查的一種制度。所以就是禁止上演西歐式英美藝備之類的戲劇，以及絕對禁止富有城市的頹廢性戲劇等。例如以無聊生活為體材的戲劇，或者以女性為中心的桃色戲劇，或者單純迎合低級趣味的喜劇，或者始終模做英美手法的輕音樂劇，這都需耍加以壓迫和禁止。尤其對於少女的歌劇，應常絕對取締。</p>
<p>還有在非常措置後，上演時間為二小時半的制度，而現在都議諭紛紜，莫衷一是地爭論着，但在主張縮短時間這一點，可以說是十家一致的要求。還有以大日本演劇協會為中心的全國巡迥劇團，加以積極的統制和指導，這也是令人注意的一件。</p>
<p>戲劇家的盡忠報國</p>
<p>上面所講的，就是決戰階段上日本戲劇的一般動向，並且這也是今日戲劇無容爭論的姿態。對於這方面為取得良好結果，指揮者官廳則絕對需要建立存力的一元演劇政策，而必須實行戲劇家自覺，所促的積極主觀贊助。</p>
<p>近數年來，這兩個方面與時俱增地逐漸達上了軌通。戲劇往往由於因襲而陷於複雜微妙的境界，這種錯誤百出的現象，不能說絕對沒有。非常措置，遂漸面對着一個明顯的終極目標，向前突飛猛進着。</p>
<p>按今日的情勢來說，尚有各種困難，而未收獲到充分成果。但關係官廳的積極領導，日本戲劇會的成立等，前面已經講過，現在業已打破了己往的障碍，且在決戰階段下已經成為創造戲劇的有效推進力了。過去我們常常看到的戲劇家那種「莫談國事」的怪癖，業已消形匿跡，現在全部戲劇家都在眞正民族意識之下，準備為自己的職業崗位，鞠躬盡瘁。日本戲劇的改組和調整，必將在最近的未來，取得完好的結果（完）（安譯自七月六日每日新聞）</p>

<h3>血與淚（五）　海軍</h3>
<p>— 岩田豐雄著　洋譯</p>
<p>在教務長室掛着籃色台布的開桌對面，肥頭大耳的I上校，露出半截身體來。</p>
<p>「眞是好機會。雖然是星天，但因查一點事情，所以未出校………」</p>
<p>「一定很忙吧！」</p>
<p>隆夫很客氣地這樣問。</p>
<p>「不，半小時的工夫總有。我很想讓畫軍艦的畫家看看潛水艇。」</p>
<p>嗓子聲音雖然相當粗躁，但是含着微笑。新田少尉因有事面到城裏去了，所以在坐者只有隆夫和眞人兩個了。</p>
<p>「方才業已看過練習艦了。全都是令人驚奇不止的事。」</p>
<p>隆夫表示着感激。</p>
<p>「我在潛水艇上服務業已很久了……常艦長，完全都把頭髮弄白了。但這並不是艇內生活苦。忍受那種苦，照理是軍人應份的事。也許說那是軍人的責任，更為恰當。再沒有感覺到比濟水艇長還大的責任。」</p>
<p>「呵！」</p>
<p>「常然，這不是說艇長一個人勞苦。如非全部人員都緊張起來，往往因舵手和排注水手的些許不注意，竟招致沒頂大禍。所以全部人員的呼吸，必須上下一致。同時，世界上就沒有比得上潛水艇那樣有家庭感覺的艦艇。或許這是因為全部人員的生命都由潛水艇來支持所致，同時上至艇長士官，下至兵卒，大家吃同樣好壞的飯。這樣事情，在其他種艦裏就不這樣。此外艇長和士官，非常關心兵卒。兵卒也很信賴長官……。我也會給一個兵士作過媒人，令他們結婚過……」</p>
<p>I校被日光晒焦了的面孔上，透出來無限的笑意。</p>
<p>隆夫認為發生這樣上下一致的感情，原因或許是由於過去從未體騐的潛過去所致。例如有一羣人逃到陰山背後去，長期實行人所不知的苦行和奮鬥，於是就產生團結和精誠，這豈不是和潛水艇員一樣麼？老實說，開始看太平洋風波大作的今天，都把視綫逐漸集中於雜誌報章，這誰肯談潛水艇的事呢？只是潛水艇遇艱時，或許會引起世人的注意。降夫心中這樣反反復復地思索</p>
<p>「去年八月成潛上士的死，也就是一個具體表現。自己捨身搶救浸水，這自然是想保護至尊的帝國艦艇心所致，但我認為另一面則是對可信賴的長官和親愛的部下等最大友情的流露。」</p>
<p>I上校的語調裹，已經含着沉痛的意思了。（一二四）</p>

<h3>On the European Situation</h3>
<p>— Chen Binhe</p>
<p>Question: In recent days, attention from all sectors has shifted from the Japanese cabinet reshuffle to the European situation. Moreover, many people are speculating about the East Asian situation based on the European situation. What is your opinion on this?</p>
<p>Answer: The current situation in Europe and the situation in East Asia are completely separate matters and cannot be discussed together. As for worrying about the East Asian situation based on the European situation, it is simply unnecessary and a case of foolish people troubling themselves!</p>
<p>Question: What is the latest on the European situation?</p>
<p>Answer: Regarding the European situation, the assassination attempt on German leader Hitler seems to be what everyone is most concerned about. However, this matter has already become old news and there is no need for speculation. According to reports from all sides, as well as Hitler's broadcast speeches, it is clear that the perpetrators were just some non-active-duty German officers, unrelated to the German operational command. It had no impact on morale or public sentiment. The German government has now appointed Goering as the supreme military representative and Himmler as the commander of the domestic defense forces, which will further strengthen national defense capabilities.</p>
<p>Question: Then what is the trend of the European war?</p>
<p>Answer: The future of the European war does not depend on internal German affairs. The important keys lie in the following two aspects: The Eastern Front, Northern France, and the Balkans. Regarding the war on the Eastern Front, since the British and American invasion of Europe and the opening of the landing war, the Soviet Union has taken the opportunity to launch a large-scale summer offensive, and the war situation is fierce. However, on the northern Finnish-Soviet front, the Soviet army has made no progress after occupying Vyborg. On the southern Ukrainian-Romanian front, the Red Army is also lingering on the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains, at a loss of what to do. Only the three armies on the "Baltic coast" in the center and the three armies of "Belarus" have made relatively good progress. The northern route has approached the border of East Prussia, and the southern route has invaded old Poland and threatens Warsaw. However, the German army on this front has followed its planned strategy of inflicting blows on the Soviet army, and then calmly breaking out of the encirclement. The Soviet plan to encircle and annihilate the German army has not been completely successful.</p>
<p>As for Northern France, although the number of American and British troops is large, the area occupied so far has not exceeded one hundred kilometers. The reason why it has not progressed as rapidly as the Eastern Front is due to the strong defensive capabilities and clever tactics of the German army, and the lack of fighting spirit of the British and American troops.</p>
<p>In addition, there has been no major progress on the Italian front by the anti-Axis forces, and the overall situation in the Balkan Peninsula, which has long been the focus of attention, is still favorable to the Axis powers.</p>
<p>Question: What new developments are there in the relations between the United States, Britain and the Soviet Union?</p>
<p>Answer: From the perspective of the overall world war situation, Britain and the United States are still in a disadvantageous position, which is an obvious fact. Therefore, Britain and the United States have no choice but to be constrained by the Soviet Union in terms of strategy. However, as the military and political power of the Soviet Union in Europe and the Balkans increases day by day, the suspicion and antipathy of Britain and the United States towards the Soviet Union is also increasing. This is also a fact that cannot be ignored. Therefore, we can infer that: The contradictions between the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union in their offensive strategies in Europe will inevitably become more acute in the future; The diplomatic war between the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union over the various exiled European governments will become increasingly fierce in the future; Conflicts between the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union from strategy to politics will still be unavoidable.</p>
<p>Question: What is the anti-Axis countries' attitude toward the situation in East Asia?</p>
<p>Answer: The contradictions of the anti-Axis countries in Europe have not yet been fully revealed because of the seriousness of the war situation. However, the contradictions in their policies toward East Asia are very open. Last year, the Soviet Union refused to participate in the Cairo Conference of Roosevelt, Churchill, and Chiang Kai-shek because of the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact. This year, a new Soviet-Japanese agreement has been announced, which shows that the Soviet Union is determined not to be used by Britain and the United States as a tool in East Asia. This fact has a great impact on the security of Japan's northern border. At the same time, Britain and the United States are also isolated in East Asia. In addition, at this time when the European situation is becoming increasingly severe, Britain and the United States are already feeling the pain of being exhausted by the European war. Their risky invasion of Saipan and Guam is simply a manifestation of their inner anxiety in the face of exhaustion.</p>
<h3>Japan Holds Regular Cabinet Meeting to Review the Current War Situation and Decide on Budget Compilation Guidelines for the Next Fiscal Year</h3>

<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) The budget compilation guidelines for the next fiscal year in Japan have been prepared as a result of consultations between Finance Minister Ishiwata and officials of the Ministry of Finance. It was officially decided at the regular cabinet meeting on the 25th and officially announced by the Information Bureau at 3:00 p.m. on the 25th. The compilation of the new budget is based on the Koiso-Yonai Cabinet's policy of mobilizing the total national power for military purposes. The main points are as follows: To participate in the war with total national power, to exert all wisdom and ability, and to practice enduring hardship and hard work, and to strengthen the system of sure victory and no defeat is the most important purpose. In terms of budget compilation and implementation, a mobile compilation policy is adopted to cope with the war situation. Strict and prudent national funds, material mobilization, and labor mobilization plans are in place to deal with sudden changes, air raids, and other unexpected events. The budget should increase aircraft production and other emergency measures. Based on the above guidelines, the new budgets of all ministries will not be approved in principle. Only the established expenses will be implemented. Outside of the established expenses, temporary expenditures will be made from the budget. Therefore, the budget control outline and the plan-making method that have been followed for the past few years will be completely abolished. Matters that should be carried out due to changes in the situation will be decided by the cabinet or by an official meeting. This kind of mobile budget method is quite noteworthy.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 26th (Central News Agency) Since the Incident, the rural areas have been extremely dilapidated, and there is almost no construction to speak of. Although there are many reasons for the decline, the main ones are the poor security of the farmers, the unsound local administration, and the failure to find reasonable solutions to the problems of agricultural product prices and transportation. As a result, production has decreased, and the lives of farmers have been plunged into misery. The impact has made the social economy unstable, and the administrative power cannot be exerted. In order to address the problems and seek improvements, the National Economic Commission has drafted an outline of the rural construction plan and submitted it to the National Defense Council for revision and approval. It also plans to organize a Rural Construction Implementation Committee in the short term to be responsible for promoting the plan. All parties attach great importance to this. The universal construction of rural areas is the foundation for the survival and development of our country, and the establishment of the plan outline is the initial work for the construction of rural areas. At the same time, during this decisive battle period, the phenomenon of material shortages can be alleviated by the success of rural construction, which can increase production and make the supply of materials smoother. This will not only stabilize the people's livelihood and ensure military needs, but also contribute to the Greater East Asia War and share the important responsibility of building East Asia.</p>
<h3>Outline of the Rural Construction Plan</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 26th (Central News Agency) Outline of the Rural Construction Plan: Purpose The focus of the policy of our National Government this year is "purifying thought, ensuring security, and increasing production." These three are mutually related and must be combined into one to advance them simultaneously. In terms of prioritizing the order of importance and urgency, emphasis should be placed on increasing production... The most important reasons are the following six: Poor security in rural areas. Various armed groups extorting from farmers. Shortcomings in the price, purchase method, and marketing of agricultural products. Many shortcomings in local administration. The lack of thoroughness in farmer education and the lack of organization among farmers. The lack of vitality and inadequacies in agricultural technology guidance agencies and economic assistance agencies. Now, to eliminate these reasons, it is necessary to start with the construction of rural areas. Only by engaging in rural construction can rural organizations be improved, the development of general agriculture established, the relationship between cities and rural areas further integrated, the strength of the national society cultivated, and civilization promoted, thereby ensuring the future leap-forward development of China. The most painful problems China is currently facing are the soaring prices, the insufficient production of food, the failure to thoroughly implement clean government, the unsatisfactory tax system reform, and the failure to achieve peaceful unification at an early date. How to demobilize the existing army and allow them to return to farming in the future all require the universal promotion of rural construction before fundamental solutions with permanence can be obtained. In order to thoroughly suppress price increases and reduce the problem of food shortages, production must be increased, and the exchange of production materials must be ensured. The implementation of clean government depends greatly on the overall renewal of local military and administrative power. Therefore, tax system reform must be preceded by the rectification of purchasing physical goods, tax levies, and miscellaneous taxes. Therefore, promoting peaceful unification relies on the implementation of good governance under the rule of our National Government to increase the trust of people and their leaders in other regions in our National Government and to resolutely come back. To allow the army to demobilize and return to farming, rural security must be ensured. In short, the above-mentioned important matters all require the early success of rural construction before they can be concretely realized one by one. Moreover, the administrative power of our National Government and its concept of participating in the war must all strive for rural construction before they can penetrate among the Chinese people. This is undoubtedly true. Implementation Guidelines According to the current situation in our country and the stage of economic development, rural construction should take the county as the basic unit. The province and the central government are responsible for planning, coordination, guidance, supervision, and promotion. Details are described below: First, selecting Bao Yan County Before the experience and guidance capabilities in Tan Village construction have matured, one county in each of the three provinces and one city should be selected as an experimental county, so that the guidance capabilities in all aspects can be concentrated here. Based on the results obtained from the experiments, gradually improve and gradually expand. Experimental County Area A. Standards for the selection of experimental counties When selecting experimental counties, special attention should be paid to the following points: Places with relatively good security. Places where transportation is not particularly inconvenient. County magistrates who have a full understanding and enthusiasm for rural construction and must be honest. Places where facilities for training rural youth groups can have the hope of obtaining accommodation farms. To the extent possible, places where cooperatives have developed to a considerable extent. B. Selection of Experimental County and Appointment of County Magistrate The selection of the experimental county and the appointment of the county magistrate of the experimental county shall be decided by the relevant provincial and central government departments in advance through consultation. The term of office is three years. No dismissal shall be made during the term of office unless there is a particularly serious fault. Those with outstanding achievements shall be reappointed or specially rewarded. C. Supervision of Experimental County The first supervision and promotion of the experimental county shall be the responsibility of the provincial government. The central government may implement guidance and promotion affairs with the provincial government or in cooperation with the provincial government. At the same time, it plans the overall development of the construction industry and allocates considerable subsidies to be forwarded to the experimental county by the provincial government. D. Preparation of Experimental County Before the establishment of the experimental county, the county magistrates and cadre staff of each county summoned by the central government shall conduct lectures and training on the concept and methods of rural construction and experimental county construction.

<h3>Japanese Planes Attack Lingling, Destroying More Than Ten Chongqing Planes; Chongqing Troops in Hengyang Isolated</h3>
<p>A Certain Base on the China Front, 26th (Central News Agency) A Japanese bomber squadron raided the Lingling airfield late at night on the 4th, destroying six Chongqing planes (in addition to two others) and seven airfield warehouses, which caught fire after being hit. It is reported that on that day, the Japanese bomber squadron flew over Lingling in the dark of night, and made a courageous dive bombing amid the fierce anti-aircraft fire of the Chongqing army. More than eighteen small planes were hit and burned, and seven military facilities were also severely bombed. The runway was temporarily unusable. The Chongqing-US Air Force attempted to move out to the Hengyang battlefield, but these dozens of planes that were left over from Guilin were all destroyed by Japanese planes.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 26th (Central News Agency) A special correspondent of the Associated Press reported on the 25th that the situation in Hunan is as follows: The Japanese army on the Hunan front has gradually compressed the encirclement of Hengyang. The Chongqing troops coming to the rescue have not yet been able to break through the Japanese encirclement. Therefore, the battle of Hengyang, which has continued for nearly a month, is now gradually reaching its final stage. If the Japanese army captures Hengyang, the protruding point of the Chongqing army in the southeast of the city will be eliminated, and then the attack on the 270-kilometer section of the Yuehan Front, which is still in the hands of the Chongqing army, will inevitably begin. The special correspondent described the tragic battle of Hengyang as follows: According to news from the front lines, in the month since June 25, the Japanese army has concentrated artillery fire to destroy the Chongqing army in Hengyang, which is under siege. It has also broken into the New Street outside the old city, and has twice broken through the city walls and broken into the old city. In one month, the Chongqing army only broke through the encirclement in the West Gate area twice, and was able to contact the Western rescue troops at that time. However, by July 10, it had been encircled by the Japanese army again. The Chongqing army in Hengyang has three months of food. Other weapons, ammunition, and medical supplies are also supplied by air.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Social Welfare Hosts Capital Press Corps</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 26th (Central News Agency) The Ministry of Social Welfare hosted Chinese and foreign reporters from the capital at the Nanjing Lianhuan Society at 3:00 p.m. on the 26th and answered reporters' questions. The following is a record: Regarding the preparation of the Shanghai vagrant labor camp, the advanced work now is to rectify the second step of preparation. The preparatory committee has decided that the start-up cost will be 30 million yuan. This cost will not be requested from the National Government. Only 10 million yuan has been determined, and 20 million yuan is still lacking. It is planned to raise funds in Shanghai, so the start-up cost will not be a problem. It is now tentatively budgeted to take in 1,000 vagrants, and the main labor work will be agricultural cultivation. Regarding the production work of the Huainan Coal Mine Company, because the number of workers is too small, in order to adjust the number of workers in the company, it is planned to set up labor recruitment offices in the Jianghuai area to be responsible for recruiting workers. Regarding the status of labor service work in Nanjing, the first item of Nanjing national voluntary labor is to clean up the garbage in the urban area to ensure the cleanliness of the city, and it will be promoted step by step in the future. Since it started on June 15, it has been largely completed by July 15. The two districts can be fully completed around August 14.</p>
<h3>All Parties Urgently Hope to Ban Black Market Train Tickets</h3>
<p>Nanjing Jiang, 16th (Central News Agency) In the past, there were many travelers on the Central China Railway, and there were those who engaged in small-scale smuggling everywhere. However, the number of tickets sold daily was limited, resulting in a far greater actual shortage than the traffic and transportation could meet. Therefore, unscrupulous people rush to buy train tickets and sell them on the black market, sometimes for three or four times the price of the tickets. This has a huge impact on the transportation of legitimate passengers. The relevant authorities have issued a general ban, but this phenomenon has not been eradicated to this day. Some unscrupulous employees within the China Railway Company take advantage of their positions to sell black tickets. This is not only related to the prestige of the China Railway Company authorities, but will also affect the transportation of legitimate passengers. Therefore, it is hoped that the China Railway Company authorities will rectify this situation as soon as possible. At the same time, the Ministry of Construction authorities should also earnestly assume the responsibility of supervision and guidance, and ensure that this undesirable phenomenon is completely eradicated.</p>

<h3>Imam Ibrahim Talks About Promoting Muslim Unity and Striving for Independence</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) – In response to the May statement by Grand Mufti Fussen of Germany, pointing out the direction for Muslims to advance in the world war, Imam Ibrahim of this city, who is currently ill, issued a statement on the 25th, calling on Muslims to unite and strive for independence. (It is noted that Imam Ibrahim has been bedridden since the spring and is currently being treated by Dr. Sakaguchi, the director of internal medicine at Tokyo University.) The main points of his speech are as follows: The Muslim nation is now at a critical juncture of survival. At this time, all Muslims must pay attention to the following two points. First, the long-term spiritual combination of East Asia and Muslims. Since ancient times, Muslims have often been invaded by Western European nations, such as the Crusades in ancient times and British imperialism in modern times, which are obvious examples. However, our Muslims and East Asia have always maintained friendly relations. Whether in China or India, Islam can be freely spread. In particular, Japan has given great sympathy and support to the independence of oppressed Muslim nations and Asian nations. Therefore, East Asian countries and Japan are all allies of Muslims. Second, Muslims must always unite sincerely and strive for independence. Opportunities have now matured in various parts of West Asia. Britain fears the encroachment of the United States and is now trying to win the favor of Muslims. We Muslims should take this opportunity to form an Arab Federation with Arabs, unite as one, and prepare to counterattack British and American forces. Therefore, we must cooperate with East Asia, which is now working hard to destroy Britain and the United States, to promote the revival of Muslims. I am determined to devote all my efforts to this path until this goal is achieved.</p>

<h3>Germany Strengthens Domestic Front, Exerts All Efforts to Overcome National Crisis, Goebbels Appointed as General Mobilization Supervisor</h3>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) – The German official announcement stated that the head of state has appointed Goebbels as the General Mobilization Supervisor. The main points of the head of state's order are as follows: The situation of the war is now actively demanding the exhaustion of armed forces and the teaching of military equipment. Therefore, the following points are announced: Marshal Goering, Chairman of the German Defense Agreement Council, proposed the appointment of a General Mobilization Supervisor to make life adapt to all the requirements of the all-out war. This supervisor must make all public gatherings suitable for the all-out war and seek to ensure that armed forces and military equipment are not affected by human resources. In addition, there are plans to review railway and postal services and other public agencies and public facilities to seek a large amount of personnel savings. Restricting, blocking, or simplifying the organization and methods of various activities that are not very important to the implementation of the war in order to maximize human resources to supply armed forces and war industries. The party secretary-general, based on his own authority, will use the party's strength to enthusiastically support the various measures I have ordered.</p>
<h3>Goebbels Broadcast</h3>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) Huitong News: The newly appointed Special Commissioner for Full-Scale Operations, Dr. Goebbels, is scheduled to deliver a broadcast speech at 8:15 PM today (2:15 AM Shanghai Daylight Saving Time on Thursday), which will take approximately forty-five minutes to complete.</p>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) Dr. Goebbels, the German General Mobilization Supervisor, broadcast to the nation on the 26th, clarifying the specific emergency measures program. After being granted extraordinary plenary powers by the head of state, the doctor expects the simplification of the German public and private life, that is, to be simplified commercial to transportation, public gatherings, cultural life, and other matters will be straightened out. When Dr. Goebbels was the commander of the Berlin Defense, he implemented all appropriate measures with a small number of subordinates and cadres under repeated bombings of the anti-Axis. After Dr. Goebbels took office as the General Mobilization Supervisor, he would also carry out major tasks with a doctrine that is less cultivated and more refined. The German people also feel the need to strengthen the domestic sentiment and have been emphasizing the necessity of general mobilization in newspapers in recent days. After the promulgation of the extraordinary measures of the head of state Hitler, the national people all have the will to fight to the end and come forward to help overcome the national crisis together.</p>
<h3>Diplomatic Activities Backed by Military Force</h3>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) Huitong News: What measures the German government will take to enhance military operations is currently the main question in Berlin. German newspaper commentaries indicate that Germany will establish a strong reserve army. A German official spokesman mentioned yesterday the internal mobilization of the German people to seek strict measures for victory. When asked whether German foreign policy would be more active after recent developments, the answer was that German foreign policy has always been active, and the international relations between this country and its Southeast European allies are particularly close. They often exchange opinions and adjust their steps. The Germans firmly believe that military can win. It would be a misunderstanding to think that if the military situation is considered unfavorable, politics must be placed above the military. When asked whether Germany's allies will also take measures to strengthen domestic activities, the answer was that Germany has always been a leader for its allies in war steps. Soon, facts will prove that Germany's new measures can encourage its allies to rise up and follow suit.</p>
<h3>Ten Million New Recruits in Training</h3>

<h3>Details of the German Conspiracy Case: Time Bomb Placed Under Carpet, Meeting Room Almost Completely Destroyed</h3>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) At the Munich meeting, General Beck, the Chief of Staff of the German Army, and a few other German generals, dissatisfied with the Nazi Party's guidance on the war, conceived the idea of assassinating Head of State Hitler. On the 20th of this month, Colonel Stauffenberg of the Army Headquarters took the opportunity to visit the headquarters and placed a time bomb under the carpet of the conference room. The bomb exploded at approximately 1:00 PM on the 20th, but the head of state suffered burns and gunshot wounds, which were inconsequential. Mr. Berger, the head of state's typist, died shortly after being seriously injured. General Kortan, the Chief of Staff of the German Air Force, and Major General Brandt, the former Chief of Staff of the German Army Operations Headquarters, died one after another on the 23rd after suffering serious injuries. Among other staff members, Lieutenant General Schmundt, Lieutenant Colonel Rookman were seriously injured, General Jodl sustained a minor head injury, Generals Buhle, Bodewin-Keitel, Scherff, Hotska, Admiral Voss, and Admiral Hewel sustained minor injuries. Despite the above unfortunate events, Head of State Hitler continued to hold talks with Commander Mussolini at the pre-arranged time. Subsequently, according to a photograph published in a German newspaper, the exploded conference room was almost completely destroyed. All walls and pillars were destroyed, chairs and tables were damaged, and window glass was scattered. At the same time, fearing that a part of the domestic communication organs would be occupied by the rebels, the German head of state's camp released the details of the incident four hours later, at 5:40 PM. At the same time, the reactionaries spread the news that Head of State Hitler had been bombed to death. In response, the head of state personally broadcast to the nation late on the 20th, confirming that he was unharmed. Admiral Niess also delivered a radio address, strongly condemning the unscrupulous actions and expressing complete sincerity to the head of state.</p>

While Donovan was in Madrid, the White House strictly kept secret who was participating in the negotiations with Donovan at the same time. When Archbishop Spellman of New York was in the Vatican, Donovan began secret negotiations in Madrid. Donovan was the one who designed the invasion of Africa for Roosevelt in 1940 and had long talks with General Weygand in Algiers. It is currently unknown whether Donovan hopes to find a second Darlan in Madrid this time. Neutral parties believe that both Donovan and Spellman are under Roosevelt's secret orders to seek an advantage for his next negotiation with Churchill.</p>
<h3>German Troops Abandon Roblin After Fierce Fighting, Soviet Troops Advance Towards the Vistula River</h3>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) Huitong News: The weak German defenders of Roblin fought to the last bullet before ceasing resistance. The city was besieged by Soviet troops for many days, and now Soviet troops have advanced towards the Rosla River.</p>
<p>Berlin, 26th (German News Agency) News: The Eastern Front's southern flank warfare spread to the Carpathian mountain outposts on Monday, where the Hungarian army suppressed or blocked the powerful Soviet offensive in the Stanislav region. The Lviv region was also the arena of major warfare again, with German forces holding their lines everywhere. The pressure against the Yaroslav district and the north bank of the San River is increasing. On Monday evening, after fierce fighting, the enemy established several small bridgeheads across the river. The offensive action launched by the German army in the Brest-Litovsk northwest in the day before had progressed smoothly, with German mechanized and armored forces advancing towards the Bug River, sweeping away several enemy bridgeheads. Northeast of Kaunas, particularly fierce fighting broke out, where the town of Vilkomir was abandoned by German forces after a fierce battle, and attempts by the enemy to break into or tear apart German lines were frustrated.</p>
<h3>General Beck Masterminded Crime</h3>
<p>According to the second announcement on the night of the 20th, the ringleader of the conspiracy committed suicide after the failure of the plan, and General Beck has been executed. The incident has been largely resolved. The despicable plan of the rebels has ultimately become a pie in the sky. Dr. Dietzmann, the German Minister of Information, announced the death of General Beck on the 21st. General Beck was one of Germany's few excellent staff members and has written extensively on military operations. Today, German leaders such as General Halder were all trained by the general. However, he resigned after opposing the Anti-Comintern Pact and Ribbentrop's assumption of the post of Foreign Minister in August 1938. Due to the above various relationships, there have been those who expanded the propaganda of the background of this incident. However, thanks to the lightning measures of the German government, Germany has remained extremely calm, but rather believes that the head of state's escape from the disaster was due to divine protection, so the will to fight has become more vigorous. On the evening of the 20th, troops were dispatched in the city center of Berlin for about six hours, and machine guns were set up at important locations in the city to block traffic by German soldiers, which was quite tense for a while. At first glance, it seemed to be a search of private residences, while pedestrians on the street still talked and laughed freely with the security forces. Since the 21st, Germany has become peaceful.</p>
<h3>Maintaining Strict Neutrality Under Soviet Pressure, German Troops Withdraw from Bulgarian Territory</h3>
<p>Budapest, 26th (Central News Agency) It is reported that the Bulgarian government, with the understanding of the German government, has established the following two policies: 1. Strictly maintain neutrality in the war between the Soviet Union and other countries. 2. Adjust diplomatic relations with the Turkish government. Bulgaria's establishment of this policy is not an indication of breaking away from the Axis camp, but rather a transformation of diplomatic policy based on the understanding of the German government. Due to the recent new developments in the Eastern Front, the Soviet Union's oppressive policy towards Bulgaria is gradually intensifying, and Germany, based on the overall war situation, has to transfer valuable troops to other fronts. At the same time, in order to alleviate the Soviet Union's pressure, it recognized Bulgaria's policy of strict neutrality. Based on the changing situation, the main force for the defense of the ports of Varna and Burgas on the Black Sea coast has recently been handed over from the German army to the Bulgarian army, and the security of the lighting control in the area has been lifted.</p>
<h3>Subtly Answering Soviet Demands</h3>
<p>According to the Associated Press in Ankara, the Soviet government threatened the Bulgarian government, demanding that German troops quickly withdraw from Bulgaria's naval and air bases, otherwise it would declare war on Bulgaria. The Bulgarian government had no choice but to admit it in principle. According to a Sofia telegram, with the consent of the German government, the Bulgarian government gave a subtle reply to the Soviet Union's request to set up consulates in the ports of Varna and Burgas, and requested the Soviet government to do the following: 1. Give the Soviet government a considerable period of hesitation on the conditions requested. 2. Stop communist propaganda in Bulgaria. It is reported that the Soviet Embassy in Sofia has shown some improvement in this attitude.</p>
<h3>Growing Friendship Between Turkey and Bulgaria</h3>
<p>The rapprochement between the Bulgarian and Turkish governments is certainly based on the support of the German government, but on the other hand, it is also due to the Soviet Union's oppression of the Turkish government that it has made it easier for Turkey and Bulgaria to get closer. A few days before the United States and Britain imposed an economic embargo on Turkey, a trade agreement was established between Turkey and Bulgaria, which can also be said to be one of the reasons for promoting the rapprochement between Turkey and Bulgaria. In short, in practice, the Bulgarian government uses Turkey to prevent the invasion of the anti-Axis forces, while the Turkish government, by cooperating with the neutralized Bulgarian government, can strengthen its own tendency to neutrality in order to avoid and reject the demands of the Soviet, American, and British groups to participate in the war.</p>
<h3>Major Battle Unfolds on Normandy Front, Enemy's Combined Offensive Never Ceases</h3>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) German News Agency News, military news: On Tuesday morning, the British Second Army gathered an unprecedented amount of material resources and launched a large-scale offensive on a narrow position south and southeast of Caen. The ferocity of the attack increased on the same day. The German side had anticipated this offensive and had made careful preparations, so the counterattack was immediately successful. The British army only formed a gap in one place in the German army's position, with its deepest point being 3.5 kilometers (between Saint-Ante and Bogaev). Northeast of Hill 88 south of Miseaugnon, the British army was blocked by the counterattacking German army, and the German army still secured the Caen-Falaise highway, which passes through the Orne River to the US First Defense Area. The British army was unable to change its line on the west side of Bogaev. The US military's attack on the east wing of the Cotentin Peninsula has also developed into a large-scale offensive, but it has made very little progress in a narrow area. The German army is currently launching a major counterattack.</p>
<h3>German Rearguard Battles South of Florence</h3>
<p>Bex, 26th (Central News Agency) German News Agency News, military news: In Italy, the Anglo-American forces launched a large-scale labor force in the area south of Florence on Tuesday, which had been anticipated. The enemy forces particularly emphasized attacking the highway from Ponte Ponche and Montefajetton to Florence. The German rearguard units curbed all enemy assaults, and after fierce fighting, they disengaged from the enemy to the north as planned.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Declares Restoration of Relations with Poland</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 26th (Central News Agency) Huitong News, Moscow Radio said: The Soviet Union and Poland have restored diplomatic relations. The telegram did not indicate which Polish government it had restored relations with, but it probably refers to the Polish Liberation Committee in Moscow.</p>
<h3>The Dynamics of Naval Strategy</h3>
<p>— Lingqiu</p>
<p>The U.S. Navy, occupying Saipan Island, is bragging shamelessly. They are propagating that a U.S. Navy landing on the Chinese mainland to press upon the Japanese mainland is as easy as turning one's hand. But comparing the places where the British and Americans have failed since the start of the Greater East Asia War with the places they have now recovered, the current situation is only a drop in the bucket. Can they boast that naval operations are approaching victory based on this? This is just the reconstruction of a fragmented and incomplete fleet that suffered a preemptive strike by the Japanese Navy in the initial battles of the Greater East Asia War. There is nothing surprising about it. This situation was known before the war began.</p>
<p>Islands or Battleships?</p>
<p>The German war theorist Clausewitz once said that because war is a means to pursue national policy, the purpose of armed combat, which is a component of war, is "to induce a state in which the enemy people consider making peace more advantageous than continuing the war." Therefore, the purpose of naval operations is to control the largest and widest communication routes on Earth—the oceans; to control and dominate traffic and communication on the oceans; to inflict fatal blows on the enemy's politics, military, economy, and ideology; and to destroy its functions. Obtaining that sea control mechanism is the main purpose of naval operations.</p>
<p>Therefore, if anyone believes the U.S. Navy's claim that occupying Saipan Island constitutes a decisive victory in naval operations, it is a truly ridiculous misunderstanding. Occupying an island results in the advancement of fleet and aircraft bases. Therefore, occupying any island means gaining control of the sea within a radius of two to three thousand kilometers. But if the Japanese fleet were to sortie, drive off the U.S. fleet, and retake the island, this sea control would vanish like a bubble. Even Nimitz acknowledges: "The Japanese fleet is still completely intact." Under these circumstances, how can the capture of Saipan Island be touted as a victory in naval operations?</p>
<p>To acquire sea control, the necessary methods and means to maintain sea control are nothing other than destroying the enemy's main fleet.</p>
<p>Maneuvering or Decisive Battle?</p>
<p>Destroying the enemy's main fleet, the main purpose of naval operations, is easier said than done. This was true not only in this war but also in the Russo-Japanese War. For example, in the famous battle of February 1904, despite launching night attacks, bombardments, blockades, and mine attacks against the enemy's Far East Fleet base at Port Arthur, and then continuing to block the port, using all sorts of methods, the enemy fleet could not be annihilated. Even on August 10, when the Far East Fleet, which had launched a major sortie, was intercepted on the open sea and defeated, resulting in the victory of the Yellow Sea Battle, this victory in a supporting operation was not enough to secure true sea control. Only after defeating the Russian main fleet that had traveled across the oceans from the Baltic Sea could Japan secure victory.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Admiral Uemura, commander of the Japanese Second Fleet, suffered a stone-throwing incident at his home in the countryside, troubled by the lack of understanding of the people.</p>
<p>It is foolish to be alternately worried and pleased by the trends in naval operations' supporting operations. If the enemy's advance on Saipan Island can be used as a good opportunity to implement a fleet attrition strategy, it would be a good thing for Japan. Japan also calls this a "bleeding tactic." If it can gradually cause the enemy fleet to be annihilated, it can be said that the purpose of the supporting operation has been fully achieved.</p>
<p>Decisive Battle or Not?</p>
<p>Comparing the Greater East Asia War with the Russo-Japanese War in terms of naval operations, there are significant differences in the following points:</p>
<p>First, the battlefield is vast. In the Russo-Japanese War, the main battlefields of naval operations were limited to the Yellow Sea and the Sea of Japan. However, in the Greater East Asia War, the world's largest oceans, the Pacific and much of the Indian Ocean, are dotted with strategic areas. Naval forces are also dispersed and deployed in various directions. As a result, it is extremely difficult to obtain an opportunity to bring together the strength of both sides to hold a decisive battle between main fleets.</p>
<p>Second, due to the development of modern weapons such as aircraft, submarines, and radio wave detectors, the nature of naval warfare has changed. In the era of the Russo-Japanese War, naval battles used only surface ships. Now, with the addition of air warfare and underwater warfare, they have become three-dimensional. As a result, because aircraft can use their speed to attack enemy fleets before they enter a decisive battle, a true fleet battle has become difficult. Moreover, due to the appearance of radio wave detectors, fleet movements can be detected from tens of thousands of miles away. Therefore, a fleet that knows the movements of enemy fleets outside the line of sight can avoid them in advance, making a fleet battle even more impossible.</p>
<p>Third, the United States is different from Russia during the Russo-Japanese War. There is no fatal turmoil in politics, economy, or ideology. There is no deep-seated desire for an early decisive battle to save the rampant anti-war and war-weariness sentiments or the intensification of domestic unrest. Therefore, a fleet battle cannot be realized quickly.</p>
<p>What is Maneuver Warfare?</p>
<p>But what should be noted here is that the movements of the U.S. Navy have become apparent. That is the U.S. Navy's maneuver warfare since this spring. For example, why did the U.S. Navy dare to penetrate deep into the Japanese Navy's inner line and carry out landing operations on Saipan Island and Omiya Island (Guam)? On the one hand, the U.S. government authorities, wanting to give a good impression to the wavering American people before the election and to seek a favorable development of the war situation, cannot conceal their anxiety. On the other hand, we must think of the dream of Admiral Mahan, who established the basic strategy of the U.S. Navy.</p>
<p>According to Mahan's tactics: "If you want to constantly hold sea control, you should maintain local superiority and constantly attack the enemy." Using more than ten battleships, more than twenty aircraft carriers, etc., to form the 58th Mobile Force and advance on the isolated island of Saipan, their aim is to pursue that dream of Mahan. Mahan said: "To defeat the enemy fleet and secure sea control, you should attack the enemy's most urgent place, put the enemy fleet in a state where it cannot but rescue, and intercept it on the ocean where you want it to be."</p>
<p>The U.S. fleet thought that Saipan Island was the most urgent place for Japan, so it attacked it urgently, and at the same time, it wanted to intercept the sortie of the Japanese fleet, prepare its most desired posture, and wait in full battle array. In response, the Japanese Combined Fleet only ordered a part of it to sortie, launching a preemptive attack with aircraft, achieving great results, and making the attrition strategy a success, while at the same time making Mahan's dream vanish like a bubble.</p>
<p>Of course, this is a misunderstanding by the U.S. Navy authorities, thinking that the isolated island of Saipan, which has no large airport and no sufficient naval port facilities, is a key location for Japan. However, the excellence of the Japanese Navy's strategy of cautiously advancing towards final victory cannot but be admired.</p>
<p>But what about Omiya Island? On this question, I intend to remain silent for now, leaving it for the readers to consider.</p>
<p>What are the Conditions for a Decisive Battle?</p>
<p>Summarizing the above, it can be reduced to two questions: To what extent will the Japanese fleet tolerate the U.S. Mobile Force's reckless actions, and where will the decisive battle be fought?</p>
<p>Here, it is necessary to think that, as with land operations, terrain is also an important factor in naval operations.</p>
<p>Before World War I, when Germany was working hard to build a strong fleet to promote its world policy, the then British Naval Minister Churchill ridiculed: "With just your naval fleet, you cannot be called a naval power. Your world policy is like standing on clay." Indeed, in World War I, the German Navy's sorties to the main battlefield, the Atlantic Ocean, were blocked, and it could only operate in the secondary battlefields of the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. This was the result of Germany focusing solely on building up its fleet and forgetting the strategic terrain, another element of sea power. Terrain is so important in naval operations.</p>
<p>What is the significance of so-called strategic terrain in naval operations?</p>
<p>First, having a connection with appropriate naval bases. The reason why the U.S. Navy did not directly advance from Hawaii to Saipan Island, but spent a great deal of sacrifice to occupy small islands such as Makin and Tarawa, can be said to be to obtain naval bases. Occupying Saipan Island can also be seen as building a naval base.</p>
<p>Second, we must be on the inner line and make the enemy on the outer line. At the necessary location, at the necessary time, we can always concentrate superior forces to make a preemptive attack, and we will have a grasp of victory.</p>
<p>Moreover, inner-line operations have the advantage of being safe and quick because the rear communication and transportation routes are short. The major reasons for the Japanese army's retreat from Guadalcanal Island and the German army's shortening of the front line from Moscow are also due to the overextended supply lines.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, which country's navy occupies the advantage of the inner line, and which country's navy is troubled by maintaining overextended supply lines, please spread out a map and study it. The U.S. 58th Mobile Force claims to be able to continue operating away from base for several weeks. But studying the distances of travel in the Pacific Ocean shows that its operations are subject to great restrictions. But to say more would be a strategic secret. It cannot be clearly stated where the fleet battle, which will determine the rise and fall of the two countries, is advantageous to Japan. It can even be said that this concerns the fate of ten billion people in East Asia. Please imagine it for yourselves!</p>
<p>Especially in today's age of advanced aircraft, being able to have aircraft that can fly from land bases, that are large and have long endurance, and that carry large amounts of bombs participate in naval battles is the best condition. Mahan, seeing this condition, cannot consider a fleet battle. On this point, the U.S. military authorities would say that aircraft carriers have mobility and offensive capability, and are excellent.</p>
<p>However, aircraft carriers have a loading capacity of about a hundred aircraft for large ones and only dozens for small ones. If they encounter the divine-skill dive bombing of the Japanese Air Force, they will be sunk in an instant. Therefore, the words of the U.S. Navy are just propaganda to justify the weak state of the U.S. Navy, which has had many islands occupied by Japan.</p>
<p>Where Have They Come?</p>
<p>U.S. General Nimitz, who occupied Saipan Island, once claimed that because the Japanese fleet is still intact, he expects that there will still be several fierce battles in the future. However, he still boasted that with the strength of the U.S. Navy, it would be as easy as turning one's hand to advance north and press upon the Japanese mainland or to go west and land on the Chinese mainland. But in reality, they neither went north nor west, but instead launched another landing operation on Tiankong Island again from the 21st. From this, it is not difficult to imagine how small the strategic position of Hanban Island is beyond their expectations, and how difficult operations outside the Mariana Islands are. This illustrates the insecurity of the U.S. military's extended supply lines. But what cannot be ignored here is that Japan, in the inner-line camp, although it has sea areas to defend sea control, it cannot be said with certainty that the U.S. Navy's passage is impossible in terms of time and space.</p>
<p>Sea control is not an iron wall built on the sea. Nor is it setting a sphere of influence with a solid iron fence, preventing the enemy from approaching a step. The battlefield is a vast and boundless continent without mountains, valleys, rivers, or roads. Its sphere of influence is at most only to the extent of not allowing freedom of movement. Therefore, its effect is not absolutely static, but is a relative thing that is bound to have some fluctuations in time and space. This is similar to air control. The airspace above Shanghai is completely under Japan's air control. It is absolutely not a place where enemy aircraft can fly freely. But to say that not a single aircraft can invade is impossible in terms of the nature of the sky and the performance of aircraft.</p>
<p>Therefore, even if the U.S. military occupies Saipan Island, lands on Omiya Island, and bombs the Ogasawara Islands and Iwo Jima, retaliation is not absolutely impossible. As long as the Japanese Navy is still completely healthy, we are confident that victory belongs to Japan, and that the East Asian nation...</p>
<p>Where will the U.S. military attack? When the U.S. military attacks where will the Japanese fleet begin to challenge and attract? This is still unclear. In his lecture on Greater Asia, Sun Yat-sen, the Founding Father of the Republic of China, once instructed: "If the nine hundred million residents of Asia unite to cope with the situation, they will never be defeated by the four hundred million minority of Europe."</p>

<h3>Consultative Council Exchanges Opinions with Police Bureau on Improving Police Administration; Relevant Heads Answer Questions Separately</h3>
<p>Recently, the Municipal Consultative Council has repeatedly received reports from various parties stating that there is a need to improve various issues regarding police security. To openly exchange opinions, a symposium was held at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 25th at the First District Park, inviting relevant department heads from the First Police Bureau. Those present included Wu Songtao, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government; Zhao Yaoqing, Lin Kanghou, Chen Binquan, Xiang Kangyuan, Chen Riping, and Shen Siliang, Standing Committee Members of the Consultative Council; and Su Chengde, Deputy Director of the First Police Bureau, Chief Secretary Sun Lifu, Director of the Judicial Affairs Department Li Shiyu, Director of the Administration Department Lü Qi, Director of the Baojia Department Gu Gangwu, and Director of the Special High Department and Economic Security Department Gotō Shigeru. Due to illness, Director Gotō was unable to attend. Mr. Zhao Jinqing explained the purpose of the reception, proposing four suggested improvement points. The responsible department heads answered each item separately as follows:</p>
<p>Improvement Methods for Residence Permit Renewal</p>
<p>1.  Improve the procedures for renewing residence permits: [suggestion to] handle them separately at each Lianbao Office to avoid men, women, old, and young having to go to the police station to line up. For a portion of socially reputable and influential individuals, consider a stamp-based method that does not require complete fingerprinting, to suit our national customs.</p>
<p>Director Gu of the Baojia Department replied: The procedure for renewing residence permits is based on the revised Sino-Japanese exchange notes of 1942 and 1943, transferred from the Friendly Nation's soldiers to the police bureau. The police bureau cannot transfer it to the Baojia. This department, referring to the central government's methods, has formulated the "Instructions for Renewing Residence Permits in Shanghai," which have been published in the newspaper and specify the regulations in great detail. There are also flexible methods for those who cannot go to the police station in person. Within the current possible scope, efforts are being made to simplify the procedures, and personnel are being dispatched to various bureaus to supervise and improve them to provide convenience to the people. Regarding the fingerprint issue, the original regulations only allowed officials above the rank of central appointee to be exempt from fingerprinting. In order to suit our national customs, this department has forwarded a request to the central government to consider using a stamp in place of fingerprinting. However, as this concerns laws and regulations, it must wait for a clear order. Incidentally, I report that Baojia fines have been stopped, and there will be unified regulations for Baojia fees.</p>
<p>Organize Self-Defense Corps in Factories</p>
<p>2.  Regarding the organization of special self-defense corps in factories: The police bureau and factories should cooperate closely to ensure that production is not hindered. The attitude of police officers supervising them should be improved to avoid causing difficulties for the factories.</p>
<p>Director Gotō of the Special High Department and Economic Security Department replied: The purpose of organizing special self-defense corps in factories is to provide factories with adequate precautions to protect production. Men aged 16 to 50 do not need to be on guard duty completely, but should jointly assume the responsibility of vigilance. Factories can divide into portions and arrange for a small number of people to take turns on duty. If there are misunderstandings about police supervision, treating them as ordinary self-defense corps on guard duty, we are now assigning more senior police chiefs, etc., to do this, and we have strictly ordered them to improve their attitude.</p>
<p>Matters Concerning the Inspection of Weights and Measures</p>
<p>Director Lü of the Administrative Department: Regarding the use of weights and measures, if there are police officers who make things difficult for merchants transporting materials who have deficiencies, or who cheat or take advantage, this bureau does not conduct inspections randomly. Sometimes, only when someone reports it will we go to inspect. If there is a violation, it will be properly sent to the prosecutor's office. Minor violations will be punished with a fine. In the future, we will carefully investigate and supervise the handling of the matter by each branch bureau.</p>
<p>Police Officers Making Things Difficult for Material Transport</p>
<p>3.  Regarding the issue of police officers along the way making things difficult for the movement of materials: Materials that are allowed to be moved freely according to regulations should not be restricted and should be facilitated. Traffic police should limit their duties and not interfere beyond their authority. If police officers are found to be involved in making things difficult, they should be severely punished.</p>
<p>Director Gotō replied: Inspecting the movement of materials is the responsibility of the economic police. Except for prohibited items and controlled goods, other ordinary items do not require certificates. They can be moved freely within the city and are not restricted. If general police officers on the road have overstepped their authority, we will step up patrols.</p>
<p>Director Lü replied: Traffic police should not interfere with materials. This has been ordered repeatedly, but because there are too few [police officers], it cannot be corrected immediately. We hope that people from all walks of life will assist in reporting so that we can deal with it effectively.</p>
<p>Director Yao of the Inspection Department replied: If police officers have violated regulations, they will be severely punished without leniency. We hope that citizens will jointly supervise and report the facts, time, and location of the incident, and the police officer's number, in secret to the bureau for disciplinary action.</p>
<p>Six Questions Regarding Police Administration</p>
<p>Subsequently, Chen Binquan raised six questions: Do ordinary police officers receive training on a regular basis? What is the current training situation for new police officers? Has the "Baodateng" (informant) system from the former police station era been improved? Have judicial procedures in the various branch bureaus improved compared to before? Are there regulations for various road fines, and how is their use allocated? Has there been improvement in the Inspection Department compared to the era of the former police station? Deputy Director Su and the relevant department heads explained separately. Regarding the first two questions, the police bureau currently has two police training schools, one on Yulin Road and one on Dapu Bridge. The original regulations and systems of the two schools were different, but they have now been merged and unified. New police training and old police re-education are equally emphasized, divided into judicial, Baojia, special high, and administrative classes. The key points of the curriculum are divided into three areas: A. Spiritual training, B. Academic training, C. Technical training. As for police officers on duty, general training is also implemented. Each day, the bureau issues training notes, which are explained by the branch bureaus, branch chiefs, and police officers in charge. Soon, after the merger of the first and second police bureaus in this city, more emphasis will be placed on the implementation of general education. At the same time, special attention will be paid to improving the lives of police officers, progressing both spiritually and materially, to create a new and good police force.</p>
<p>Regarding whether the judicial procedures and the "Baodateng" absence from the former police station era have been improved, Director Li Shiyu of the Judicial Affairs Department explained: The judicial systems of the Public Concession Police Station and the French Concession Police Station have always been different. Since this bureau merged with the Third Police Bureau and the [illegible] West Police Bureau, it has now unified the judicial system. A judicial affairs department has been established in the general bureau, adopting a concentrated duty and dispersed service system. Each branch bureau has a judicial section, which is subject to the command and supervision of the branch chief. The review and guidance of its work is managed by the judicial affairs department. As for the lack of training for judicial police officers in the past, a judicial police officer training class has been established in the past six months. In addition to teaching legal knowledge, about sixty people (including the "Baodateng") have also received the above training. Plans are now underway to raise the level of detectives, and it is planned to recruit a number of university graduates to teach them relevant judicial police knowledge to improve the quality of detectives and ensure social safety.</p>
<p>Regarding police fines, Director Lü Qi of the Administrative Department explained that they are handled in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Interior. The police bureau provides written notification to those who are fined, and the fines are submitted to the Finance Department of the First Public Office for verification and deposit.</p>
<p>Regarding the insufficient personnel in the Inspection Department, they have not yet been able to fully exert the spirit of inspection. However, I, as the director of the Inspection Department, work day and night to clarify the police atmosphere and benefit society.</p>
<p>Finally, the standing committee members of the Municipal Consultative Council explained in detail the various issues raised today, hoping that the authorities would earnestly improve them. Mr. Chen Binquan expressed his deep admiration for the efforts of all the heads of the police authorities to improve the situation. He hoped that the police authorities would strictly monitor and report any incompetent police officers, whether they are domestic or friendly nation personnel, and that the police training aspect would focus on ideological training. The council will do its best to assist in improving the living conditions and treatment of police officers. They exchanged opinions openly for three hours, and the meeting adjourned at seven o'clock.</p>
<h3>Science and Technology Symposium</h3>
<p>Bito: Yes. We are proceeding according to this method. If you look at the results of research in various fields, such as the All-China Science and Technology Association, you can see this when the research results are reported. They ask, how can we make our work practical? Anything that can be used is immediately adopted. Let me give you another example, something decided a few days ago. A certain minister from the Navy came to me and said that the Navy is engaged in this kind of research, which seems very useful. In your opinion, can it be immediately applied to practical work? Upon receiving a notification to check whether it is applicable and provide a definite answer, I immediately conducted an inspection and experiment, and the results were very applicable. Well, then let's adopt it immediately! Let's discuss it with the Ministry of Military Supplies and issue orders to the practitioners! This matter has already gone through two phases. At least it is very effective research for enhancing combat power. Upon hearing those results, it was immediately moved to the production department within two weeks. In our opinion, at least the research conclusions do not need much haste, and if they can reach the production department, naturally, we will immediately think of ways to contribute to strengthening power. It is truly proceeding according to wartime methods. This is the inevitable future for our specialized control association, while other enterprises have a different path as their primary future. Generally speaking, modern entrepreneurs also often conduct research according to national requirements, so they do not first carefully calculate whether it is profitable before applying it to their businesses. They obey orders, and if the research results are necessary, necessary for the country, then they will produce them, regardless of how much equipment and capital is needed. Once permission is granted, it must be implemented, so when specialists estimate that the results of this research have sufficient potential for practical application, they will not hesitate and immediately move them to the production department.</p>
<p>Trial Research Orders and Production Research</p>
<p>Hanada: The simplest task for the Technical Institute is to accept invention proposals. After receiving them, some are immediately transferred to the military, while simpler ones are immediately funded to manufacture physical objects. For slightly larger-scale projects, a trial research order is issued to begin research. At the same time, due to the organizational reforms that were carried out, a new production technology department was created, and production research has also consumed a lot of money. Therefore, the objects of trial research, or transferred to the hands of entrepreneurs, also need to be developed and expanded, which is risky because they may not be able to produce. Anything necessary for the country must be supported with considerable funds for production. The Ministry of Military Supplies' Military Supply Company Bill grants such authority, so-called pioneering factories, or adventurous factories, that entrepreneurs are unwilling to start. All are continuously produced with government subsidies and aid. Recently, with the advent of a controlled economy, it is not easy for an individual to invent something good and obtain materials to manufacture it. Therefore, it is absolutely impossible without government support. Or entrepreneurs are willing to do it, but the current environment makes it impossible. At the same time, a system has now been established, where if entrepreneurs are unwilling to do it, if it is important, they are forced to do it. We believe this should be the scope. To be honest, researching these things is like sowing seeds and budding. Naturally, after budding, they are transplanted to the mountains, but if you think the buds have come out and immediately transplant them to the mountains, many will die. In short, it still needs to be cultivated in a nursery for a considerable period. This thing is cultivated in a nursery. Production research should be cultivated in a nursery for a considerable period until the branches and leaves grow strong before they can be transplanted to the mountains. In addition, there are also those that are not cultivated in a nursery but are cultivated directly in the mountains. There are still some difficulties with sowing, namely, the government's difficulties. Because it requires a budget and also needs to buy materials. For the larger projects we are researching, we immediately contact the Ministry of Military Supplies or the Army and Navy for trial production. Because everyone is very enthusiastic and the system is not chaotic, everything will definitely go smoothly.</p>
<p>: Regarding what was just said, what we are researching in the control association, and then manufacturing with the power of the control association, is insufficient. In addition, there are impossible problems even if the control association uses its full power, so we have to hand it over to the Technical Institute to try to produce it or make it producible. In general, technical staff should not ask whether the work they are doing is for the control association or for a research group, but for the country, everyone should cooperate and start working.</p>
<p>Inamura: Under these conditions, do the initial researchers have to follow through from trial production to final production, or are they no longer involved in production?</p>
<p>Hanada: Both situations exist.</p>
<p>Inamura: I heard a story from a friend who works for a company that they were too拘泥拘泥to formalism, and the research department, trial production department, and production department each became independent institutions, so when a job is transferred to the trial production department and then transferred to production, in this situation, if the initial researchers follow through to the end, the efficiency is very high, and even the most subtle details can be noticed. If it is handed over to someone else, they will not understand the initial researcher's motives and will often change things arbitrarily, resulting in the main point being missed, delaying trial production or missing the industrialization deadline. This is unavoidable in practice.</p>
<p>Hanada: Recently, we have been dealing with a problem, which is to produce resources that Japan does not have from Japanese resources. This is a job that a certain research institute has been working hard on. Research began last summer, and now we have already come up with an answer. This was accepted by the Research Mobilization Conference, and work began after the Research Mobilization Conference. However, this research institute does not have the conditions that a factory should have. So, this research institute's previous research only has one road left after passing the so-called hillside. In industry, a certain degree of latitude is needed, so you can know that if something biased to the right or left happens, it will go off track, the material will change from having to having, and it must be produced according to this purpose. This kind of work is constantly being done in the research institute. Even so, with the people from the research institute as the center, we also order other companies to implement production, so we fully use the existing equipment of the factory and supplement the deficiencies, racing against time and moving to the production stage as soon as possible. There are still problems in the factory on this, which is laughable, but there are still very many unknowns. Then we go to work with those who have various conditions in the factory. So, with the people from the company as the center, the people from the research institute participate in this, and the company sends people to the research institute to work. The company no longer considers whether it is profitable or not, and the government subsidizes materials or other items to engage in production. If the research results and goods appear, they are immediately handed over to the Ministry of Military Supplies by the Technical Institute.</p>
<p>Ohashi: Now I want to say a few words that are slightly off topic. According to the National Mobilization Act, when the complete collection of trial research is promulgated, although the practitioners spend a huge amount of research funds, the government's subsidies are very small, and only compensate for the operating expenses and personnel expenses based on the reports they submit to the government. In addition, most factories do not have trial production factories, so they confuse trial products and products, so factories that make many trial products plummet, and in business, this is a considerable burden. Therefore, if an enterprise with national significance is not established, they may not be enthusiastic about engaging in trial research. I believe that the country should have an independent trial production factory. In today's situation where there are few excellent technicians, although trial research orders are issued to many factories, it is difficult to complete them in many factories, so they will repeatedly delay招待, so I think it is best to mobilize excellent technicians to the country's trial production factory. If this kind of trial production factory cannot be realized immediately, at least the excellent technicians from the practitioners should form an organization like a patriotic group. They can help the factories that receive trial research orders at any time, I believe this is also possible.</p>
<p>Hanada: During the trial research period, there are also general mobilization trial research orders, and there are also commissioned research projects that are not so tense. There are also very simple forms of commission. In addition, there is production research that is not much different from a factory, not much different from an enterprise. Naturally, there are various stages in between. Therefore, it is necessary to adopt appropriate measures according to the objective situation, and this is an official measure, so I think it is very convenient.</p>
<p>Necessity and Encouragement of Partial Improvements</p>
<p>Inamura: Will the Creative Division produce many great results?</p>
<p>Hanada: There have been some quite meaningful things. Although I have not heard everything, things that are procedurally troublesome have not encountered resistance, and anyone interested will hand them over to the Army and Navy one by one.</p>
<p>Ohashi: In Germany, for inventors in cities, a special association is organized to strive to incorporate new practical plans into businesses. Regarding special原料 issues, they also in旋from practitioners, so as not to cause disputes. If a dispute arises, it will be resolved by the conciliation arbitration in the association. The arbitration is composed of an official from the special patent office, the president of the association, and a director from the same industry as the disputant, so that it can be properly handled.</p>
<p>Inamura: It is enough to make efforts for general things, thinking that new things can happen. In actual production organizations, meaningful results are often produced from partial improvement movements. In production organizations, previously overlooked minor improvements are said to achieve good results. Therefore, partial improvements are also very meaningful.</p>
<p>Hanada: When partial improvements appear, if the quality is good, the bonus system can also guide partial improvements in a good direction.</p>
<p>Ohashi: In the primary bonus policy for partial improvements in production organizations, sometimes scholarships are awarded for outstanding improvements, so that their children can enter university. Currently, when the fishing industry cannot encourage workers to work hard, the scholarship method is used to煽动a passion for educating their children in order to serve the country in the future, which is really a good way to kill two birds with one stone.</p>
<p>Reporter: What specific methods does the Control Association take in such occasions?</p>
<p>Bito: In the Control Association, things are being done on a small scale. (To be continued) (Quarterly Eye April Issue Japanese Theory)</p>

<h3>The Trends of Japanese Drama Under the Decisive Battle Stage Oyama Isao</h3>
<p>Full of Nationality</p>
<p>What needs to be said again is the phenomenon of injecting or maintaining nationality and community into drama. Originally, drama (of course, not limited to drama) contains nationality and community, which is a matter of course, but in the past capitalist or liberalist era, the drama system was by no means like this. In fact, it was the opposite. They thought that money could be made, and any script could be staged, even if the script contained poison for the national spirit. This is the attitude of this kind of performance, regardless of the interests of the country and the nation. The existence of this attitude is not allowed, even in peacetime, it should be so, let alone today's increasingly fierce decisive battle stage, of course, there is no need for any redundant words.</p>
<p>It is this relationship, because of the urgency of the situation, this attitude has gradually begun to be criticized and pointed out. Due to the active control and guidance of the relevant electrical bureau and the self-awareness of the actors, the past flaws are gradually eliminated. Especially after the implementation of emergency measures, this elimination movement has been strengthened. The establishment and activities of the touring troupe mentioned earlier have completely changed their previous mistakes. In addition, not long ago, the厚生the amateur actor movement of the theatrical troupes, which was very popular in local rural villages and織山workshops, can also be said to be moving forward in the correct direction. These two movements both deny the individuality and profitability in drama. The purpose of drama is to comfort the people, provide artistic defense, promote national policy, and enlighten culture. As for the above-mentioned nationality and community, it is of course also the attitude that drama should have.</p>
<p>Professional Theater Groups in Metropolitan Cities</p>
<p>Regarding this tendency of professional theater groups in big cities, it is also gradually being strengthened by control, but the direction is clearly pointed out in the emergency measures order, and compliance is forcibly required. Today, after the emergency measures, among some people, there is much talk about state-managed drama, group-managed drama, etc., as well as the establishment of theater strategy companies, theater camp groups, etc., which clearly proves that they want to take coercive measures.</p>
<p>This issue, especially in view of today's subjective and objective situation, only deeply feels the subtlety and difficulty, and the relevant officials have not even issued any positive instructions or explanations, but are hovering in a cautious attitude. But today's theatrical form, of course, cannot be allowed to continue to exist, and must be reformed.</p>
<p>National Drama Creation</p>
<p>Now let's talk about the current innovation of drama. In the positive aspect, it is to create and establish national dramas. In the negative aspect, it is to correct the urban, Western European, decadent,　oppressive, consumer, and other defects of modern drama. The former was advocated by a few far-sighted dramatists as early as several years ago, and not long ago, the Yao-yi proposition has become the unanimous demand of dramatists and cultural figures as a whole. Now the officialdom, centered on the Information Bureau, and the cultural organizations of other surrounding groups have begun to try hard.</p>
<p>In other words, the Information Bureau annually takes out huge prizes to encourage all theater groups to participate in the National Drama Volunteer Competition, and commend and reward outstanding works. The Japan Cultural Central League, in all groups called various popular plays, has offered a reward competition, and at the same time, has harvested considerable artistic value. Both of these provide comfort to national life, and with supreme spiritual power, the idea is based on the Japanese world view, and the art is to create excellent dramas with the Japanese classical drama tradition. At the same time, it is also necessary to work hard to handle the political national dramas initiated by the Army, Navy, Military Protection Institute, and other government offices to directly improve combat intent and increase production.</p>
<p>Adjusting Show Times</p>
<p>The latter is a system in which the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Metropolitan Police Department implement script inspection and performance inspection. Therefore, it is to prohibit the staging of Western European-style British and American dramas, and to absolutely prohibit decadent dramas with an urban style. For example, dramas based on boring life, or桃色dramas centered on women, or comedies that simply cater to low-level tastes, or light musicals that always imitate British and American techniques, all need to be suppressed and prohibited. In particular, operas for girls should be absolutely banned.</p>
<p>Also, after the emergency measures, the system of performance time being two and a half hours is now being debated endlessly, but in advocating shortening the time, it can be said to be the unanimous demand of everyone. It is also noteworthy that the Japan Drama Association is the center of nationwide touring theater groups, which is subject to active control and guidance.</p>
<p>Dramatists' Loyalty and Service to the Country</p>
<p>The above is the general trend of Japanese drama in the decisive battle stage, and this is also the undisputed attitude of today's drama. In order to achieve good results in this regard, the directing officialdom absolutely needs to establish a strong one-element drama policy, and must implement the self-awareness of dramatists and the active subjective support that promotes it.</p>
<p>In recent years, these two aspects have gradually reached the track in increasing numbers over time. Drama often falls into a complex and subtle realm due to inheritance, and this phenomenon of numerous errors cannot be said to be absolutely absent. The emergency measures have gradually faced a clear ultimate goal and are advancing rapidly.</p>
<p>In today's situation, there are still various difficulties, and sufficient results have not been harvested. However, the active leadership of the relevant officialdom, the establishment of the Japan Drama Association, etc., as mentioned earlier, have now broken through the obstacles of the past and have become an effective driving force for creating drama under the decisive battle stage. The 怪癖 of dramatists that we often saw in the past, "Don't talk about state affairs," has disappeared, and now all dramatists are under a true national consciousness, preparing to do their best in their professional positions. The reorganization and adjustment of Japanese drama will surely achieve good results in the near future (The End) (Translated from the Mainichi Shimbun, July 6 by An)</p>
<p>Social Services</p>
<h3>A Summary of Various Enterprises Organized by This Office, Aiming to Relieve Poverty and Illness</h3>
<p>This office organizes six types of social enterprises, with the aim of relieving poverty and illness, and showing compassion to the orphaned and helpless:</p>
<p>Poverty Relief Funds... To relieve hidden poverty and extreme poverty, widowers, widows, and those with no one to turn to, by sending them to elderly care homes.</p>
<p>Orphan Assistance Funds... To educate and raise orphans with no support, providing them with opportunities to learn skills and crafts, so that they can become useful members of society.</p>
<p>Primary School Medical Assistance Funds... To subsidize medical expenses for primary school teachers, or to introduce designated doctors and hospitals for free treatment.</p>
<p>Medical Assistance Funds... To introduce poor patients with clear circumstances and unable to afford treatment, for free treatment, or to provide appropriate subsidies for medical expenses.</p>
<p>Maternity Assistance Funds... To protect poor pregnant women, dispatching midwives for free assistance during childbirth. If there are difficult labor situations, hospitalization is allowed, and all expenses will be borne by this office.</p>
<p>Small Loans... To provide interest-free loans to unemployed talented individuals for small-scale businesses.</p>
<p>This office accepts donations, and even small contributions are appreciated. We respectfully request that compassionate individuals generously contribute to benefit others and themselves, as the merits are immeasurable.</p>
<p>Benefiting the Poor and Sick</p>
<p>The Shanghai Epidemic Hospital at 25 Xizang Road, since the epidemic section began on July 1st, does not charge for outpatient visits, registration fees, acupuncture, or medicine. It also provides free supplies and offers day and night consultations, earning a great reputation. The poor and sick have benefited immensely. In recent days, the heat has been particularly severe, and the number of outpatients at the hospital has surged, reaching over 500 people per day. The number of inpatients is approaching 100, making the consultations very intense. In addition, women and children seeking medical attention are often unaware of the procedures and panic. The hospital has specially assigned responsible personnel to provide guidance and explanations in the waiting area to comfort patients. However, the hospital has no endowment, and the expenditure on medicine is particularly high, with monthly expenses reaching two million yuan. Therefore, there is an urgent need for compassionate people from all walks of life to generously contribute, so that this charitable work will not be disrupted. If you wish to donate, please send it directly to the hospital, or it can be collected on your behalf by the social service department of this newspaper.</p>
<p>The Nantong Moral Enlightenment Society regularly promotes morality and reforms people's hearts. In particular, it is known for undertaking various charitable activities in a practical and realistic manner. In addition to establishing a voluntary smoking cessation clinic this year, it has recently set up tea distribution points, placing more than ten tea barrels in major road intersections, and hired national physician Mr. Feng Daozeng to provide free consultations and medicine at the society every afternoon at 2 p.m., greatly benefiting the poor and sick. However, due to the extraordinarily high prices of goods and the shortage of funds, it is hoped that major philanthropists at sea will generously donate to enable the society's various good deeds to continue, which is truly a blessing for the poor and needy.</p>
<p>The Wenzhou Road Pude Society's summer free clinic and medicine distribution, in order to facilitate the poor and sick in western Shanghai and avoid congestion, has agreed with Xu Tianyi National Pharmacy at 120 Jiaozhou Road to establish a branch clinic, hiring two doctors, Xu Renlong and Xu Zichang, to provide voluntary diagnosis and treatment, dispensing medicine based on vouchers, without charging any fees.</p>
<p>Kou Yu Middle School Scholarship</p>
<p>Kou Yu Middle School, located inside the new market at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Maoming Road, has always provided free places to help needy students. This summer, with the assistance of the third graduating class and others who solicited donations, new students applying for free or half-fee places in all grades can immediately contact the school to obtain application forms. There is no limit to the number of places, and both boys and girls are accepted.</p>
<p>He Duanying Piano Recital</p>
<p>Pianist Ms. He Duanying will hold a He Duanying student piano recital at the Lyceum Theatre at 5:30 p.m. on the 31st of this month.

Tickets are priced at thirty, fifty, and one hundred yuan, and will go on sale at the Lyceum Theatre on the 29th. The proceeds from the tickets, after deducting expenses, will be donated to the Shanghai Conservatory of Music to help needy students.</p>
<p>Rental Bookstore Seeks Service Personnel The first instigators, Yuan Jun et al., recognizing the difficulty faced by needy students in purchasing books, and in order to provide assistance, have initiated a used book rental service, so that every needy student can borrow textbooks without paying any money, thereby reducing their burden. At the same time, middle-class students can also borrow books. However, in terms of operations, there are too few staff and they cannot be assigned. Therefore, we are specifically seeking volunteers. Those who are willing to serve, please send a letter to Dong Yuanjun at No. 5, Lane 166, Lingbao Road, stating your name and contact address for further communication.</p>

<h3>Yi Zhihua Founds Art School, Comes to Shanghai to Raise Funds</h3>
<p>Dabao'en Temple outside Zhonghua Gate in the capital city is the oldest temple in Jiangnan (founded in the third year of Chiwu during the Three Kingdoms period). The skull of the Tang Dynasty monk Xuanzang is buried behind the temple, named Sanzang Pagoda, and a hall was built to commemorate it, named Sanzang Hall. The temple was most prosperous in the Ming Dynasty, with thousands of monks who promoted Buddhism throughout the year, spreading the teachings and converting people, almost all over the country. The prevalence of lectures was unparalleled. Throughout the dynasties, eminent monks emerged. This time, a Buddhist Art College was established in the temple, and it was supported by Chairman Wang, Acting Chairman Chen, President Wen, President Jiang, President Chu, Minister Ren, Minister Chen, Governor Chen, Governor Fu, Governor Gao, Military Commander Xu, Military Commander He, Gu Zhongchen, Wen Lanting, Zhu Hexiang, Xu Chongqin, Lin Kanghou, Liu Haisu, Xi Zicheng, Li Tailai, and other gentry in the capital.</p>
<p>The Abbot is proficient in Buddhism, calligraphy, painting, and seal carving. His paintings of figures, landscapes, ancient Buddhas, pine trees, and orchids are all elegant, fresh, and refined. His calligraphy of inscriptions, clerical script, regular script, Wei stele, Han stele, and stone drum script is powerful. His artistic achievements in calligraphy and painting can be described as profound.</p>
<p>Now, the Buddhist Art College is specially established in Dabao'en Temple in Nanjing to promote art, cultivate sentiments, expand Eastern art, enrich the dry life, and pay more attention to poetry and music, cultivate advanced specialized talents, elucidate national culture, train art education teachers, cultivate noble character of the people, study industrial art to promote social beautification. Students, monks, and nuns are accepted. Tuition and boarding fees are waived. Generally, high school or junior high school graduates who cannot afford to go to school have the opportunity to study art for free. In addition to the special production of Dabao'en Temple, the Abbot raises funds from provinces, cities, and counties. The purpose of establishing the Buddhist Art College is to depict the deeds of sages of various religions and dynasties that can correct people's hearts and promote moral education, in paintings, calligraphy, and text, so as to spread them to society, so that everyone can be nurtured by religion, and their souls can have a place to rest.</p>
<p>Now, he has come to Shanghai to raise funds, and has brought dozens of paintings of figures, landscapes, plum blossoms, orchids, pine trees, and Buddhas, all of which are the Abbot's proud works, residing in the South Courtyard of Guangfu Temple, Fangbang Road, Nanshi. Those who love calligraphy and painting should not miss it. The Buddhist Art College cultivates talents for the country free of charge, and hopes that people who are enthusiastic about social education and patriotic will assist, so that small contributions can accumulate, making the school a success quickly, which will be fortunate for religion and fortunate for the country.</p>

<h3>Blood and Tears (5) The Navy</h3>
<p>— Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Yang</p>
<p>Across the blue cloth-covered desk in the dean's office, the stout I Colonel revealed half of his body.</p>
<p>"It's a real opportunity. Although it's a starry night, I haven't left the school because I'm checking on something..."</p>
<p>"You must be busy!"</p>
<p>Longfu asked politely.</p>
<p>"No, I always have half an hour. I would like to let the painter who paints warships see the submarine."</p>
<p>Although the voice was quite rough, it contained a smile. Lieutenant Shinoda had gone to the city for something, so only Longfu and Masato were sitting there.</p>
<p>"I've already seen the training ship. Everything is just amazing."</p>
<p>Longfu expressed his gratitude.</p>
<p>"I have been serving on submarines for a long time... Captain Tokiwa has completely turned his hair white. But this is not because life inside the submarine is hard. Enduring that kind of hardship is what a soldier should do. Perhaps it is more appropriate to say that it is a soldier's responsibility. There is no responsibility greater than that of a submarine captain."</p>
<p>"Oh!"</p>
<p>"Of course, it's not that the captain is the only one who works hard. Unless all personnel are tense, even a slight inattention by the helmsman and the water injection crew can lead to a disastrous sinking. Therefore, the breathing of all personnel must be consistent from top to bottom. At the same time, there is no warship in the world with a stronger sense of family than a submarine. Perhaps this is because the lives of all personnel are supported by the submarine, and from the captain to the officers, down to the soldiers, everyone eats the same food, good or bad. This is not the case in other types of warships. In addition, the captain and officers are very concerned about the soldiers. The soldiers also trust the officers.... I have even been a matchmaker for a soldier and got them married..."</p>
<p>An infinite smile appeared on Colonel I's sunburnt face.</p>
<p>Longfu believed that the reason why such a consistent feeling of unity was generated was perhaps due to the unprecedented experience of going underwater. For example, if a group of people flee to the back of a dark mountain and engage in asceticism and struggle unknown to others for a long time, then unity and sincerity will be generated. Isn't this the same as submariners? To be honest, with the Pacific storm raging today, everyone is gradually focusing on magazines and newspapers, so who would talk about submarines? It is only when submarines encounter difficulties that they may attract the attention of the world. Longfu thought this over and over in his mind.</p>
<p>"The death of Petty Officer Narikane last August was a concrete manifestation. Selflessly sacrificing himself to rescue from flooding was naturally motivated by the desire to protect the supreme Imperial warships, but I believe that the other side was the expression of the greatest friendship with trustworthy officers and beloved subordinates."</p>
<p>Colonel I's tone already contained a sense of grief. (124)</p>
