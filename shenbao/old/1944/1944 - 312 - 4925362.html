<h3>日大元帥賜敕語　嘉尚在華陸海軍　小磯總裁對派遣軍致謝電</h3>
<p>東京十一日中央社電　日大本營十一日下午五時三十分發表：大元師陛下本日召見大本營兩幕僚长，對中國派遣軍總司令官及中國方面艦隊司令官頒賜敕語如次：華中華南方面作戰軍將兵，歷時半載，　瘴癘敢行至難之機動作戰，艱苦備嘗，到處粉碎駐渝美空軍之根據，達成作戰目的，以寄與全局之作戰，朕對此深爲嘉尙。</p>
<p>東京十一日中央社電　日小磯大政翼贊會總裁，以日軍佔領桂林，乃於十一日對煙中國方面派遣軍最高指揮官發出感謝電如次：敵美自中國大陸之反攻旣空襲日本本土，復響應以菲律賓爲中心之太平洋方面攻勢，時作不逞之蠢動，值此重大時局，因日軍之勇戰奮鬥，終於佔領渝美大陸最大航空據點佳林，戰果赫赫，尤屬空前，其意義更爲重大，後方國民莫不深爲感激，今後凡我國民，務須盡力增產必勝共器，以謝前綫將兵之武運，以表敬意。</p>
<h3>日大本營發表　佔領柳州桂林　渝方遭受重大打擊</h3>
<p>東京十一日中央社電　日大本營十一日下午四時三十分發表：（一）日軍五月下旬，於華中方面，六月下旬，於華南方面，分別開始作戰。十日上午十時，將柳州完全攻陷，十二時更完全陷桂林，　减該方面之美空軍基地羣，即在中國大陸上獲得優勢之戰略態勢。（二）該方面作戰之日陸軍部隊最高指揮官，爲陸單大將圖村寗次。海軍部隊最高指揮官，爲海軍大將低藤信竹。華中方面日陸軍部　指揮官，爲陸軍中將橫山勇。華南方面日陸軍最高指揮官，爲陸軍中將田中久一。海軍部隊指揮官，爲海軍中將副島大助，陸軍航空部隊指揮官，爲陸軍中將山下琢　。</p>
<p>廣西前綫十一日中央社電　攻入桂林城內之日軍，自十日晨起，即展開猛烈之巷戰。十日正午，完全佔領挂林市，於此渝軍第三十一軍即吿完全　服。</p>
<p>意義極爲重要</p>
<p>廣西某日基地十一日中央社電　桂林柳州被日軍佔領，此次之日軍攻勢，僅以半載之時間，即已席捲中國大陸中原，實爲世界戰史所罕見者。至此其最後工作即吿一段落，邁進決戰階段之此次攻勢，於政戰兩略上意義與使命，寶爲重大。若由戰略上而言，爲徹底粉碎河南湖南廣西等，渝方抗戰中樞戰區軍及其培養根源，將中國截爲東西兩段，使其失去與美軍反攻太平洋之對應力，實爲予淪方之痛烈打擊。進而更使駐渝美空軍退至內地，此實爲戰略意義。觀美軍於菲律賓之反攻，亦可易於窺知。同時日軍攻勢之銳利，雖陷桂林柳州，仍不稍懈，更由此處巳可指向美空軍根據地之昆明，以及抗戰首都之重慶。今日敵陣營所受威脅愈益加重，前者史蒂威維爾被召回事實，充分暗示渝美關係之內幕，美國擬干涉渝方內政，達成其宿願。故渝方已受制內外兩面之强壓，已遭逢抗戰以來之最大危機，自勿庸質言矣。</p>
<p>渝軍師長陣亡</p>
<p>廣西前綫十一日中央社電　據桂林陷落時，俘獲之渝第十三師機關槍隊副少謝陳某供稱，判明渝第百三十一師長確已陣亡。</p>
<h3>松島部長談　太平洋戰局　美軍行動今後益困難</h3>
<p>日駐華艦隊報道部長松島大佐，十一日在滬會見中國記者團。發表談話如左：</p>
<p>因敵艦隊之退却，菲島方面海上，目下維持靜穩狀態，然鑑於馬里亞納暨新幾內亞方面之敵方情况，敵軍將有施行新計劃之可能。敵美殘存艦隊之勢力，顯已極爲薄弱，敵美日大西洋方面縱能抽調若干援軍，然可稱艦隊作戰中心之航空母艦勢力，已極低下，今後美軍行動之益形困難，彰彰明甚。雷伊泰島方面之陸上戰鬥，日軍已斷然取積極攻勢，正與海陸基地航空部隊合力擊滅敵軍中。敵方爲渡過此重難關，顯然傾其所有力量，故左右現戰局之重大時機，可謂即在今後數月中。</p>
<p>華萊士之再度奉派赴渝，其理由想係和綏先前召回史蒂威爾時　於尖銳化之渝美感情，並以開發西北爲餌，藉繫渝方戰意。太平洋及大陸方面，日軍鐵路上之偉大成功，預料將使美國今後更於外交上鈎心鬥角，以政治方式拉攏重慶。</p>
<p>戰爭之第一要諦，在於擊減敵軍，羅斯福四選之成功與否，在日本原不成問題，自我人而言，大束亞戰爭罪魁之留於負責地位，以便我人充分予以痛擊，實不勝歡迎，深信日本國民之戰意將因此更見旺感。</p>
<p>敵美新編機動部隊</p>
<p>東京十一日中央社電　美航空母艦勢力，因臺灣空戰及菲律賓海戰後，已蒙重大損害，故於本週初已新編機動部隊，再度出動於菲律賓東方海面，對菲律賓實施艦載機之攻擊，然共規模極爲散漫無章，故於前週即謀增强哇爾馬黑方面之基地航空部隊，以期協力菲律賓方面作戰，而展開戰略轟炸。其機動部隊之行動，最近頗爲愼重，本週初在菲律賓東方海面蠢動之機動部隊，實施微弱之攻擊後，即從菲律賓附近海面避退，此因恐懼日軍艦航空部隊之攻擊，其後損失空母一艘後，寬感極度恐慌，其對最後之空母羣大量予以保全，以對付今後戰局之動向，今太平洋上日美決戰之主動權，已完全移歸日軍手中。</p>
<p>日機轟炸塔克羅班</p>
<p>馬尼刺十一日中央社電　日航空部隊曾於十日黎明轟炸塔克羅班機塲，使三處起火。又是日於空戰中，擊落P38型機十四架，擊毀其二架。</p>
<p>今日各地舉行國父誕辰紀念　中樞當局謁陵致敬</p>
<p>南京十一日中央社電十二日爲國父誕辰，全國各地均準備莊肅紀念，中樞當局亦定於是日上午十時，全體中央委員及各院部會長官·恭謁國父陵寢，敬獻花圈，以示追念，隨後幷將赴靈谷寺致祭國民革命烈士及援助中國革命日本同志。於此，吾人深知國人於莊肅紀念之餘，更能認識環境，體念時艱，上下一心加緊團結，帮向擊滅英美共同敵人完遂大東亞戰爭這途邁進，以實現國父大亞洲主義之理念。祈求中國早日復興，東亞早日解放，進而謀大東亞共榮建設，貢獻於世界繁榮。</p>
<p>星期評論</p>
<h3>紀念國父革命精神</h3>
<p>— 禮仁</p>
<p>今天是國父誕生的七十九周年祀念日。當此大亞洲主義普及於大東亞地域的時期，緬懷先哲，繼往開來，所謂「光祖宗之玄憲，振大漢之天聲」，眞有無窮的惑慨！</p>
<p>國父的革命精神，長存於我們的心中，我們應該如何用正確的行動來紀念他？</p>
<p>國父說得好：「夫事有順乎天理，應乎人情，適乎世界之潮流，合乎人羣之需要，而爲先知先覺者所決志行之，則斷無不成者也，此古今之革命維新興邦建國等事業是也。」先知先覺的國父底一生，幾乎是革命史的全部。他底降生離太平天國革命及英帝國主義最醜惡的鴉片戰爭不遠，他目擊淸廷的腐敗，英帝國主義侵略之勢日亟，民族已趨於極度危險，知非推翻淸廷另建民國，不足以救亡。他在革命的實踐上永垂不朽的；一是辛亥革命的成功；二爲不斷的加强國民黨。另外，在思想上的表現是：一·倡「行易知難」學說；二·三民主義理論體系的確立；三·建國方略，建國大綱與實業計劃的製定。</p>
<p>起自一八五一年的太平天國革命，當時得地有十七省之多，有將兵百數十萬，然而不十四年間，竟至光沈響絕，薰歇烟滅，遭受了革命史上最慘痛的失敗，其故安在呢？最大的原因是在革命過程上缺乏了一個偉大而英明的領袖，來正確地領導着。</p>
<p>國父以偉大的人格，正確的思想，更以堅毅的精神，一生領導着革命，創造中國民國——這歷程是痛苦艱難的，他不愧是個眞正的革命領袖。</p>
<p>他底革命是堅決而澈底的，一切都根據於民衆的立塲。他爲了擴充革命勢力，在許多民間秘密會社中也潛行宣傳革命想想，自傳（建國方略）中有這樣的一段：「……洪門創設於明朝遺老，起於康熙，康熙以前，明忠臣烈士，多力國恢復，誓不臣淸，至康熙情勢已盛，二三遺老，見大勢已去，欲以民族主義之根苗，流傳後代，以反淸復明之宗旨，結爲團體，以待後起。……必也最合羣衆心理之事跡，而傳民族國家之思想。洪門拜會，以演戲爲之，口號暗語，以鄙俚粗俗之言表之，……以後結合之需要，不過爲手足患難之聯絡而已，政治意味全失。……會黨中人，知識薄弱，團體散慢，只望之爲響應，不能用爲原動力。」</p>
<p>他這種精確深刻的見解，何等發人猛省。誠然，在興中會時代，他深入了會黨，加以組織，利用，但至同盟會時，已建立了廣大的革命黨，設立了好些報紙雜誌，從事於宣傳。他很認革命是大衆的事業，未嘗以黨魁自居，不把自己看作英雄。原先，他在建立思想時代，週游香港，日本，歐美各地，宣傳他底理論時，華僑莫不以洪永猛獸視之。國父不屈不撓，再接再厲，絡於逐漸地獲得了許多同志；在革命的軍事行動中，又不知經過了幾十回的挫折，但他絲亳不爲之動搖。他底最明顯的在軍事上的失敗就有十次：</p>
<p>首次失敗——設農學會於羊城爲機關，當時贊襄幹部事務者有鄧蔭南，楊衡雲，黃詠商，陳少白，而助運籌的則爲陸皓東，鄭士良，他則常往業於廣州香港間，籌備甚周，聲勢極盛。乃以動轉兵械不愼，致被海關破獲手槍六百餘，事機遂洩，陸皓東殉之。</p>
<p>二次失敗——庚子之役，同志等在廣州屢謀，史堅如決意自行用炸藥攻燬兩廣總督署而殲之，炸發不中，史遂被害。</p>
<p>三次失敗——國父離日，與胡漢民注精衛至安南，設機關部於河內，旋發動潮州黃岡之難，不利。</p>
<p>四次失敗——命鄧子瑜等起義於惠州，未成。</p>
<p>五次失敗——革命運進園靈山，力薄難進，繼而退入十萬大山。</p>
<p>六次失敗——僅百餘衆握據三砲台，會攻龍州，退入安南。</p>
<p>經過六次失敗之後，汪精衛氏感到極度憤激，於是約同志數人，謀刺攝政王，惜一擊不中，被捕入獄，至武昌起義，乃釋放。</p>
<p>七次失敗——黃克强等以二百餘人出安南，橫行欽廉一帶，援絕退出。</p>
<p>八次失敗——黃明堂等襲河口，淸十倍於革命軍，黃率一百餘人退人安南。</p>
<p>九次失敗——以廣州新軍舉事，倪映典率部從沙河進攻省城，被截擊於橫枝岡。</p>
<p>經此九敗，國父由橫濱約黃克强，胡漢民等商謀捲土重來，同志等以新收之餘，精銳迨盡，新軍亡命南來者頗多，招待安插，又無餘力，同志等住食行動，且處資將不繼，舉目前途，不堪其憂。國父叩詢將來計劃，咸唏噓太息。國父安慰他們說：「以前初次失敗，幾爲舉世共充，經過數度奮鬥，再仆再攏，造成了民衆思想的轉變，他們正渴望着繼續奮鬥，從此可慮的祗在我們的沒計劃，無剪氣！」國父遂即回港，勉力籌款，曉以大義，共舉偉業。</p>
<p>最後一搏——辛亥三月二十九日，廣州集各省精英舉事，不幸成爲十次失敗。然而革命的形勢，再也不能被壓制了。</p>
<p>失敗爲成功之母，國父的精神經一次失敗，得到一層堅定崇高的思想？經一度頓挫，而得到一層經騐。</p>
<p>終於武昌起義了，淸代的官吏聞風而逃了，更獲得國際的同情；各省又不斷響應了，不數月十五省光復了，繼而全國易幟了，造成了燦爛的中華民國。</p>

<h3>南京最近米價及其影響</h3>
<p>— 閔賢</p>
<p>最近期內，上海米價高漲，每石超過兩萬元，因之刺激一般物價，無不直綫上漲，民生益苦。但是南京米價始終盤旋於六千元內外，與上海米價相差三倍以上，記者爲明瞭眞相起見，實地一看。</p>
<p>一般物價情形</p>
<p>南京的一般物價，布疋，化妝品，以及五洋等日用品，很受上海的影響，但是這類貨物價格雖然追隨上海風聲而高昇，可是因爲人民缺乏購買力關係，倒是無大問津。譬如年來新闢之復興，建康，永安，大華等百貨商塲，大多門可羅雀，氣象極爲蕭條。創設最久之中華路中難百貨商塲內空房竟達四分之三，生意冷落，可見一斑。其次，如食物價格，幾乎無不較上海便宜一半，如大餅油條仿賣五元一件，並不小於上海者。四十元可食肉麵一大碗，陽春麵僅需二十元一碗。若在中等型之飯館包飯，係人一日兩餐，米飯儘量供給，每月僅需二千八百元。此種價格，恐在上海低級的館攤亦不可能。旅社房金，亦較二月前相差無幾，以是南京人目前的生活狀况，似較上海人平穩得多。總之食物價錢若無大的波動，則生活上的威脅不至於太感嚴重，目前南京的黑市米價上白米每石六千三百元，本麵每斤四十元</p>
<p>米糧收購情形</p>
<p>記者爲明瞭南京最近收購米糧情形，特往米統會南京辦事處訪問。據該處副主任賈聘三君稱，南京區收購米糧區域，係江寗句容溧水江浦六合五縣。現在實際上能收購米糧者，僅江寗句容溧水三縣。因爲江浦出產米糧，僅敷本縣消費　，從前江浦之米，全係安徽全椒等縣轉運而來，現因某種原因，不能運米。至六合縣產米尙不够該縣本身需用。所幸收購成績，尚不甚報。自九月二十日開始展開收購工作以來，現在已經交存倉庫者，計有四萬石，已訂收購契約者，約有八萬石。今後仍當積極收購，京市人民配給米，每月共六萬石，加以公務員俸米配給數千石，每月共需米糧約七萬石，以後祇要不發生特殊困難，當可按月供給，不至愆期。至於米糧小販每欠可以搬運八公斤入城，甚至有一人一日搬動數次者，爲精頗有可觀，大多集中於大中橋等販賣，南京黑市米價不能過於跳高，此種米販不無相當關係。並謂收購米糧時，各地鄕鎭咻長以及自衛團等，不需索者甚少，殊感棘手云云。賈君原爲米糧商人，並係南京市雜糧發業同業公會理事長，與一般官式談話，似覺有所不同也。（寄自南京）</p>

<h3>敵機昨晨襲滬　經猛烈擊退　我方損害極輕微</h3>
<p>上海日陸海軍報道部十一月十一日十二時四十分發表：「本日（十一日）上午八時五十分，敵Ｂ２９型機數架，波狀形侵入上海地區，向郊外數處投彈，經我方制空部隊及地上部隊，將其擊退，我方損害，極爲輕微。」</p>
<p>松島部長發表談話</p>
<p>本日上午八時五十分，敵Ｂ２９型機數架，侵入滬市，並在郊外投彈。本人前此屢次說過，敵機此種舉動，在大東亞戰爭的戰鬥中是毫無價値的，不過是一種神經戰的手段而已。據悉，今晨敵機往日本空襲，因此，襲滬敵機，似乎牽制與呼應。這種盲目空襲，在戰略上旣無意義，從整個戰局而言，又無價値。惟今後對於敵方輕舉妄動，應特別慎重，準備萬全。在警報期間，本市市民的行動，尚未符台當局屢次指示，甚爲遺憾。今日敵機空襲截至目前止據報吿消息，泰與路（前麥特赫斯脫路）康定路口（前康腦脫路）有高射砲流彈彈片擦過，行人略有死傷，計死二人，重傷二人，輕傷十三人，全係中國人，因不知空襲準備，致有此不幸。在此決戰階段中，空襲是預料中事，但爲爭取勝利，實屬不可避免的。上海一般市民，猶以爲在上海不會受戰爭影響，這種觀念，是完全錯誤的，今後希望市民更加認識，更加奮起</p>
<p>防空本部警告市民</p>
<p>市民防空本部昨爲敵機襲滬事，有所發表，謂：「今日Ｂ２９式敵機數架來滬空襲，可謂敵人企圖打開東亞戰事僵局之唯一手段，早經屢次吿戒民衆。今晨傳來日本方面空襲消息，與本市空襲彼此呼應，敵人此舉半屬牽制，半屬偵察，其濫施轟炸，並無戰略上之價値，不過藉以震恐上海市民之神經而已。由全而戰局而觀，亦毫無意義可言，惟本市民衆今後對於敵人此種企圖，應更爲戒備，歷來空襲警報發令中之市民行動，尚有不符當局指示之處，至爲遺憾。市民或在路上行走，或在屋外逗留，全乏緊張態度，必致自招傷亡之禍，關於此點，務希特別注意。</p>
<p>目前正値決戰時期，空襲等舉，爲勢所當然之事，果欲克敵制勝，必打破上海在戰事圈外之觀念，市民務須深察戰局之眞相，一致奮起，以謀自衛」。</p>
<p>空襲時間必須避難</p>
<p>市民防空本部當局，昨發表談話如下：</p>
<p>本月十一日晨敵方Ｂ２９型機侵入上海地區，施行波狀型之空襲，而敵方因受日本陸海軍制空及地上部隊之熾烈對空砲火之洗禮，並無何大作爲，僅爲神經戰之盲目轟炸，即行遁去而已。此次之空襲因太平洋戰爭之逼迫，故作游擊的來襲，而自今後戰局觀之，敵方對上海地區，此種空襲極爲容易，故在戰爭下，實全不足奇也。</p>
<p>而於本日之空製時，市民中有若干人受傷，實不勝遺憾，而受傷者極少，可稱不幸中之幸也。本來凡在空襲時，敵機前米投彈，而吾方之防空砲火，亦開始發射，其砲彈之炸裂後之彈片落下，亦屢見不鮮，故日本陸海軍防空司令部，前曾發表吿示如下：</p>
<p>凡在空襲警報發令時，除實接從事防空業務者外，均須避入防空壕或屋內之適當避難所，而本日市民中有極多無用之人，在外不避，故因而中彈片而受傷，其禍實由自取也，而敵機在頭上時，市民當避入建築物之凹所，以免不測之災害，而在戰局之現階段，市民須充分知悉待避之方法，勿於空襲時慌亂騷動，而實行各自所豫定之行動，故希望市民再須充分訓練，並對於在本日敵機盲炸下，始終奮勇工作之防空自警團員，深表謝意也。</p>

<h3>桂林柳州陷落　敵美企圖粉碎　出淵部長發表談話</h3>
<p>盟邦中國派造軍上海陸軍報道部出淵部長，於日軍佔領桂林後發表談話如下：</p>
<p>「夫桂林及柳州之陷落，實有極大之意義，蓋敵美空軍爲企圖自中國大陸方面侵攻日本本土起見，故過去費二年之歲月，在西南地區築營航空要塞，而至今已吿崩潰，我方於大東亞之戰略綫，更加强其不敗不拔之强靸性，而太平洋之戰局，又吿一大轉換，并有攻勢移轉之重要意義也。</p>
<p>眞正敵人僅爲英美</p>
<p>今次大作戰開始時，帝國政府曾發表聲明謂：「眞正敵人僅有英美，重慶將兵若能覺悟不與英美協力，而來歸我者，則非敵人」，我方作戰，始終基於此聲明之精神，徹底採道義之行動。重慶政權此次已失去河南省之大半及湖南省之全域，此次又失陷廣西之重要據點之桂林及柳州，且在皇軍之鐵槌下，損耗極大之戰力。重慶當局前爲企圖導入敵美空軍勢力至中國大陸起見，乃允許敵美以桂林及衡陽等地爲中心，設立西南地區之基地羣，以此威脅日本本土，而重慶軍則與在華敵美軍協力，而爲其先鋒，作無益之抗戰，至今重慶軍隊己演長沙、衡陽、梧州、及桂平之悲劇於先，而又於桂林及柳州重演悲劇於後，現吾單決予以重懲，而使其覺悟也。但吾人之感可悲者，乃使湖南、廣西兩省民衆，流離失所，家破人亡，但我軍本此次作戰之大精神，對於無辜之中國民衆，決不傷害，并極力保護，而敵美在華空軍則慘無人道，採取焦土戰略，使市街成爲灰燼，並破壞文化事業，前對於長沙衡陽等失陷都市，極力施以殘虐之轟炸暴行，此次又對桂林及柳州大施轟炸，並以梧州爲例，敵美空軍對逃難之中國民衆，以機槍掃射殘殺之，吾人對於敵美此種暴行，極表憤慨，并對敵美之殘忍心，極感可嘆，而重慶當局之繼續英美協力，以使中國民衆無法脫離此不幸之境，實不勝哀惜之至也。</p>
<h3>敎局昨召各校　敎職員訓話　並請松島部長演講</h3>
<p>市敎育局昨（十一）日在本市山海關路育才中學大禮堂，召集全市公私立中小學敎職員訓話，敦請盟邦日本駐華艦隊報道部長松島大佐演講，對敵機襲滬及十月十日以來，菲島一帶戰况，分析極詳，繼即由戴局長致訓，內容計分三點：（一）負起時代使命，（二）努力本位工作，（三）造成優良學風等，并報吿二月來本市敎政槪况。</p>
<p>短評</p>
<h3>注意防空安全</h3>
<p>敵機昨晨侵襲本市時，在泰興路康定路口，高射砲流彈擦傷行人。在此戰時，敵機空襲原爲意料中事，防空當局對於市民趨避也已一再指示，爲今後市民的安全，我們提出應加注意的兩事：</p>
<p>（一）希望市民沉靜，在空襲聲中，善自趨避，驚慌固然不必，輕浮也非所宜。譬如在高射砲射擊敵機時，大多數市民引爲奇觀，佇立屋頂，或羣集窗口，仰首翹望，指手劃脚，雖經防空人員勸導，充耳不聞。此種大意行動，極易遭受流彈飛傷，且爲偵察目標，今後務宜注意。</p>
<p>（二）在空襲時間，路人應即向近處里弄或大厦趨避，以策安全。聞一有干里弄，一聞警報，將弄口鐵門關閉，若千大厦，在例假日將鐵門關閉，致路人無從趨避，這在防空上實應加以糾正，應請防空當局或警察當局通知里弄及大厦管門人注意，并由防空及保甲人員在空襲時間梭巡注意。</p>

<h3>新幾內亞密林中　日軍勇士奮戰記</h3>
<p>當那瓜達爾卡那爾島上至今尙有一部份日軍將士在困苦艱難中奮戰的消息傳來時，我們是如何驚嘆呀，我們是如何興奮，迄今仍在監視軍的行動，一逢良機，即强使敵軍流出大量的血。這批勇士們的苦鬥，以及他們在連得野獸也不　息的深幽的密林中的生活，　告訴我們生是如何比死更爲困難。關於迄今尙在新幾內亞拉巴爾健鬥的將士近況，最近曾有報告傳到基地來，大體如下：</p>
<p>新幾內亞的密林中，高達四十公尺的大樹，非常繁茂，它們選住了天日，處於其中，宛如落入深穴。在它們中間，有時還可看到幹的直徑達七公尺之巨的大樹。在大樹和大樹之間，垂下組約二·三寸的藤壁，東　西絡，作成了間不容身的藤壁。如要抬頭仰觀　空，眞是想也休想。陽光不知從何處屈折透入，微微的光這亮，祇够勉强辦明包圍的景物而已</p>
<p>營舍移動無定</p>
<p>在這樣的地方，日軍將士設下了他們的營舍。但也不能長久駐紮在一定的地點，因爲敵人的飛機不分晝夜地在天空中飛翔探索着，萬一被他們找到，便要遭到如火似茶的轟炸了。敵軍非但依仗軍械的充足，並且很膽小，祇要覺得有些可疑，便會不惜工本地撇下鋼鐵和火藥。因此，日軍將士們便不得不時時移動，使他們無從察覺了。所謂兵舍，也不過是一個空名，實際上不過在四棵椰子樹之間，在距地一公尺半以上之處擱架地板，用草及椰子的葉蓋成屋頂。地板所以要架得如此高的緣故，就因密林中非常潮濕，低了很容易生病。在移動中的時候，則用携帶着的帳幕，睡在枯葉上面。在密林中間的移動，眞是再苦也沒有的事。士兵們非但要將火器彈藥及一切應用雜物統統背在肩上，而且還要像在地下掘隧道般伐開樹木之壁，一步一步摸縈着前進，這樣還算是好的，有時過到深沒膝部的泥深，那才沒有辦法哩！靴子和綁腿布沒有了之後，就得亦着脚跑，顧不得足上流血不流血。至於落伍，更是千萬不可以，不管你走得動走不動，都得咬緊牙齒緊緊隨着隊伍。這種痛苦向誰去訴呢？同伴們不都是一樣困苦嗎？至多不過大聲怒吼數聲，藉以舒散一下　結之氣，自已鼓勵一下自己。</p>
<p>樹皮草根充飢</p>
<p>平素的這種移動，比較起來還算是好的。某次，某部隊從某某移動，時途申並且缺乏糧食，全體不得不拿樹皮草根來充飢。到後來，實在餓得乏力了，壓在背上的東西似乎越來越重，　樑彷彿要斷了，腰也直不起來了，迫不得已，祇好將不緊要的東西一樣一樣丟，甚至連高價的照相機也捨掉了。香烟也沒有，有人斫下士枯枝，將枯葉楺碎，用粗紙卷起來當烟吃。因爲肚子飢餓和營養不良的緣故，無緣無故發起熱來的人很多，大部分是患上了痛疾病。像某某隊說一日平均病例四個人。更可惱的是熱帶潰傷，不論怎樣醫治，總是不肯好</p>
<p>在長久的行軍之後，歸返基地時，勇士們都不可以立即吃飯，因爲密林中的生活使他們的體質也起了變化。某隊長曾向部下大聲警告道：「四天內不要吃飯，吃了要死的！」幾個沒有聽到警告而貪吃的士兵，果然都不幸地喪了生。知道這種危險而告誡部下「不要吃飯」的隊長，是多麼愛他的弟兄們呀！聽到這件事的人，沒有一個不感動萬分的。有些士兵，在基地上雖然漸漸將身體養好，恢復到原來的樣子，但肚子却因殘留着密林裏吃下去的草木皮，以致鬧起大便不通來。</p>
<p>充滿旺盛意氣</p>
<p>在這種非人世的密林生活中備受磨折的勇士們，始終充滿旺盛的意氣。「她媽的，瞧你老子的手段！」他們的眼中國出火來，飛也似地跳入敵陣，在衝右突，橫捕直斫，好比惡煞。其勇猛的樣子，眞正令人咋舌！這樣的日軍。現正散佈新幾內亞各地，這點是後方的人們片刻不可忘記的。</p>
<p>拉巴爾現在可以完全自給自給自足，雖然孤立，却仍在有力地奮戰中。敵　戰的來襲，照常未變。多的時候二百架，少的時候也有二三十架，在二十四小時中　直沒有一刻不在頭上飛。該地的勇士們，已經習以爲常，都泰然自苦，不到十分兇猛時，不輕易躱入防空　，因爲　着長久的經騐，炸彈落不落下來，馬上可以判別出來。至於夜間的空襲，知方的目的是在展開神經戰，勇士們再也不高興去理它。不過，對於降落傘炸彈和瞬發炸彈，却非提防不可。因爲降落傘炸彈祇要觸着椰子樹的按葉便會爆發，而且又是隨風顠揚的，所以不知道究竟會在何處炸裂。至於自給自足，也不是說食糧是充分了。在田裏獲得新鮮的蔬菜，很爲難得，所以勇士們的日常工作，便是下田耕種和構築陣地。對於陣地的工事，他們絕對有自信。</p>
<p>「不論什麼時候來，都呌他們異到西方去！」每人都懷着這樣的自信。（坂上特派員）（譯自十月十六日每日新聞）</p>
<h3>南洋建設</h3>
<p>治安的恢復和維持，重要國防資源的迅速獲得，現地自治體制的確立，這是日本南方軍政的三大目標。</p>
<p>南方各佔領區的治安甚形良好。蓋日軍政當局在經濟上則保障正常生活，普遍配給生活必需品，在文化上則尊重善良的習慣風俗，在政治上則尊重原住民的意志，予以溫和的待遇，在精神上則宣揚日本的實力，抹去依存英美荷的觀念。結果民心歸趨。尤其是因爲緬甸匪律賓的先生獨立，以及在爪哇、蘇門各臘、婆羅洲、馬來等使原住民有參與政治的制度和機會以來，原住民都自動協助日軍，或提供勞力，參加南方的建設，或募集義勇軍等，共同防衛。至於散處南方各地的華僑，馬來共二百五十萬，爪哇計百萬，蘇門答服約五恨，在經濟上都有根深蒂固的實力，他們現亦同樣協助日軍，進而參加南方資源的開發及工業化等建設工作，以資增强戰力</p>
<p>南方軍政在施行經濟方策之初，當然置重點於恢復因戰爭而契壞的經濟組織和產業組織，並由建設大東亞共榮圈的觀點，作成新的組織。恢復的工作，已經完成。至於改組新的經濟一　。因南方各地過去都是敵國的殖民地，是政治壓迫及經濟榨取的對象，從而在產業上亦祇是原料的供給地，被置於殖民國家造品的輸出市場的地位，所以都缺乏工業活動，處於畸形的狀態下。在金融方面，原料輸出的代價資金，再由輸入製品而被吸收，其間自有可作一定調節的組織。但在脫離各族殖民國家後，在產業方面，原料資源過剩，工業制品不足，在金融方面，通貨膨脹出現，百物價格騰漲，皆屬意中事，現對馬來的橡膠和錫，爪哇的糖，緬甸的米等過剩物資，均在講求適當的對策</p>
<p>至於現地的工業化，業已擬定現地自活五年計劃，自一九四三年春開始，包括十數種工業。例如在馬來·緬甸·蘇門答臘，爪哇建造鋼板廠，在馬來，蘇門答臘·爪哇設施電氣爐，在馬來建造木炭銑鐵的小熔爐，在爪哇·蘇門答戰設置平爐，這些都是當地工業化的基礎。。又炭化物的氏業化，以至英領時代認爲絕對不可能的鐵　土工業化，也着著實現。至於織維物質的生產，亦已樹立大增產計劃，以棉花若干萬擔，葶麻若干萬噸爲目標。食糧也着手增加生產，以期自給自足。</p>
<p>爲便利資源的運輸，日本與南洋間的交通必須圓滑，故目下南洋各地積極建築木造船，馬來·爪哇·匪律賓各地，對於木造船，已有飛躍的進展。製告造木造船所用的機器也在馬來·爪哇動工。故海洋交通於不久的將來，必有驚人的進步。（白爺）</p>
<h3>參戰後的匪島　民衆戰意旺盛</h3>
<p>由於九月二十一二十二兩天美機大舉空襲首都馬尼剌，菲島民衆對於美國已不能忍耐了。殘暴的轟炸和掃射，無緣無故殺傷了不少無辜的菲律賓國民，並且不分皂白的破壞了醫院及敎會等。以前，由於敵方的謀略宣傳，尙有一部分菲島民衆妄加信任。但九月二十二日盲炸列加斯比時，一向宣傳稱：「美機不攻擊菲律賓人」的美機，却對在街頭步行的市民實行機槍掃射，將他們殺傷。這個事實傳到馬尼剌時，菲島國民才明白美人的殘虐，省悟「美人決不是爲了救我們而圖奮回菲島的」。現在，菲律賓已於九月二十三日對戰意益旺。十月十七日，外長勒克托作無綫電廣播稱：「菲島還是成光榮的歷史呢？抑作美國的奴隸而從歷史上消去呢，這好些全在這一戰！」促國民覺悟，激發國民的戰意。</p>
<p>參戰的菲島國民生活方面，也易窺見其如然的戰意。夜總會及舞場，自八月起即已閉歇，菜館也實行一湯一菜。過去已有的保甲防蒦團，自九月十十一日起，更見强人，組織消火，補助消防，破壞工作，補助敬官隊，救急等班，在這次空襲中已　相當成績。飮食店自從施行戒嚴令以來，在下午七時亦以晚上八時爲限，這樣不但足以預防游擊隊的活動，並柯免除杳小的趁機跳樑，國民生活的安全更得一重保障，所以市民一點不覺不便，反而感激。對於趁空襲及參戰的機會，國藏食糧等的奸商及喪心病狂者，政府抱强制共出　的强硬態度，確保戰時食糧，給予市民良好的印象，使戰意更爲旺盛。這樣，獨立已滿一週年的菲律賓國民，他們對美國的憎惡及憤慨，已一變而化爲熾烈的戰意，與日本携手，爲了取得大東亞戰爭的勝利而努力。（雲秋）</p>

<h3>達心之曲</h3>
<p>— 方正</p>
<p>我捧着高中畢業文憑，愈快的心情，回到家裏；媽瞧到文憑，那張常年不笑的臉上，也不禁露出笑容來。她　　　戴上老光眼鏡，把縛在文憑外面的紅絲帶解開，文憑上解鮮明的字眼跳入她的眼簾，雖然媽識字不多，但那文憑上的字，彷彿有魔力似的，她老望着它。這時我們全家—相依爲命的母女倆—完全掉入喜悅的氣氛中了。然而片瞬的喜却帶來永久的悲！媽收斂了面上的笑容，正色地說：</p>
<p>「眞!我好不容易，才給你中學畢業了，以後該償媽的夙願了吧！」</p>
<p>「媽！我決不使您失望，您說的我沒忘。」我很快的安慰着媽。</p>
<p>媽所謂的「夙願」，使指職業，因爲她祇有我一個女孩子，自從爸爸離開世界後，媽便茹苦含幸的靠十指收入—針術—栽培我唸完了高中，原想我馬上可我到職業，好讓她享受點人生的幸福，何況在這物價狂漲的今天，單靠着媽年年壓綫的收入，也塡不飽我倆的肚子呀！</p>
<p>—我們六親無靠，只有這二條路可走—然而他（她）們的回答却是：「現在找事很難，慢慢兒代你留意吧！」這分明是敷衍話。於是一月……二月……三……過去了，我還是墮入失業的深淵。這可怕的「慢慢兒」啊！媽不時長吁短嘆！我亦咀咒社會太無情，儘管一般時髦人物，整天價的喊着提高女權和提倡女子職業的口號，但社會上那兒有容許女子挿足的餘地？我們女子的出路又在那裏？</p>
<p>終於，我的命運被蒙上了一層暗影，開始墮入不堪收拾的冰窖！原來不知媽用什麼手段和什麼法兒，意和新搬來而在XX歌場充當歌女的X姐相識了。不特相識，而且十分「熱絡」，結果媽於一個悶熱的下午帶我去「訪問」X小姐了，使我非常狐疑，但媽的舉動，我素來不忍遠反的，因此隨着她跨進X小姐的閨房，見他僅穿着一件蟬巽紗的睡衣，斜躺在沙發上抽烟，瞧見媽來，也不起身，祇是說道：</p>
<p>「X師母！你眞不失約，若不是你來，我倒給忘了！請坐請坐！」</p>
<p>「究竟是什麼回事？媽爲什麼預先和她，X小姐—約定，又爲什甚麼帶我到這兒？」我的思潮被X小姐那尖銳的聲音打斷了：</p>
<p>「這就是你的眞小姐嗎？生的很不錯！你老眞有福氣，若是去唱歌，準會紅得發紫！」媽亦乘機跟我說：</p>
<p>「眞！你來見見X小姐，她替你找到職業了，該謝謝她。」我被逼向X小姐欠了一下身子，含着眼淚退出她的閨閣，誘人墮落的陷阱，天哪，我的「職業」！</p>
<p>晚上，我哭着，鬧着，我不能「償」媽的「夙願」，更不能去賣唱，尤不可喪失自己的人格。媽在我身傍半哄騙的淌淚勸道：</p>
<p>「眞兒：我是疼你的，　願讓你去做下戝的事！可是我們又沒貴親高戚，好的職業是永遠輸不到你的。媽一年老似一年，太不中用了，生活擔子再也負不起了！你一時若是找不着職業，難道我們母女倆等着餓死不成？要你去當妓女，舞女，　導員，或是女抬待，媽又狠不下這條心，恰巧遇着這位X小姐，她說當歌女是淸高的，女學生去唱歌的很多，某大酒樓不是舉行過歌唱比賽大會，都是女學生能加的嗎？所以我擺脫她替你介紹，承X小姐一口答應，又說歌女收入很豐富！這樣我們的生活，不是解決了？眞：你可憐可憐你媽吧！你四歲死了爸爸，我多末不容易的把你撫養得這末大，我的一生希望完全寄託在你身上……」</p>
<p>最後，我們母女倆擁抱着嚎啕了。感情克服了理智，於屈服在慈母的「感化「之下，我以慢性自殺政策答應媽的「要求！」</p>
<p>第二天的晚上我披着一件新製的布旗袍，臉上搽着不願塗抹的脂粉，跟着X小姐踏進××歌場的帳房間，X小姐把我介紹後，那個年靑帳房，斜着我跟直瞧的使我害臊，才迸出下面的命令：</p>
<p>「X小姐：讓她試唱三天，然後決定！」</p>
<p>「你說的還有錯嗎？」X小姐說着向那人媽然一笑，露出一對金牙齒瞧着幾乎使人吃的晚餐都要嘔吐出來了。</p>
<p>於是我在X小姐的「循循善誘」之下，立在麥克風前唱着：</p>
<p>「鳥兒拼命的唱，花兒任性的開，你們太痛快……」「莫忘了今宵，莫忘了今宵，我把整個的心給你了………」那晚我不知唱了幾支歌曲，當夜　人靜，才拖着疲極的身體回家。</p>
<p>從此，我每天唱着「遠心之曲」，痛苦，頹喪，伴着我度着凄苦的歲月。雖然媽說當歌女是「淸高」的，但一般捧場點戲的職客，我還得去伴座，周旋於他們的玩笑之間，簡直做了變相的妓女，舞女，　導女呀！同時爲了要「紅得發紫」，不得不跟着聽客們，也可以說是嫖客—上舞場，酒家，咖啡館……</p>
<p>如今，我是「紅」了，然而說來可憐，那是用自己淸白的身體與純潔的靈魂去換來的，現在我僅是個沒有靈性的軀殼了。</p>
<p>「……歌女忙，歌女忙，賣不盡的相思，送不盡的郎………」當我唱着那支「歌女忙」時不禁要黯然淚下了！</p>
<h3>蟋蟀</h3>
<p>— 蔣衛羣</p>
<p>看—</p>
<p>二雙　黑的蟋蟀，箝對箝，</p>
<p>腿斷了，</p>
<p>牙出了水，</p>
<p>兀是不捨的掙扎：</p>
<p>是呈自己的英勇？</p>
<p>—抑是獻媚於主子？</p>
<p>哄—盆外笑了！</p>
<p>我恨然，</p>
<p>我唱嘆。</p>
<h3>幸勞的行程</h3>
<p>— 胡生權</p>
<p>…我心裏牢牢記着：母親的生日是沒有幾天了，我們得怎樣來慶賀一下呢？擺在眼前的情勢，我們確是沒法應付一筆浩大的宴會的費用，在目前「做濤壽」也被有些人「專利」去了。或許母親已經見到這一點，她早告誡着家裏人，一許提起關於她「做壽」的事。</p>
<p>…這句話不是包涵着她的智慧，便是包涵她的世故。也許她不希罕這些俗禮，爲她化費一大把金錢，也許她看透了世態炎涼，在父親的事業受到打擊的時候，誰還高興捧着她把她當作「壽母」？如果我的猜測不幸是對的話，我眞不敢想像母親將用怎樣的心來度過她的生日？</p>
<p>…「有廿多年了」，父親常常這樣嘆息着：「你的母親和我同打着天下，却沒有享過一天福！」眼前她的五十壽辰逼近了，我們都不能給她有一天的榮耀和快活。眞的，她幾時才能安靜地享享福呢？</p>
<p>…我記得，母親的四十歲生日，是在故鄕過的；當時哥哥剛結婚，大家都想乘着喜氣洋洋的時候，替她做壽。有幾位從上海趕來的親友苦苦地勸她「開大門」鬧一天，却被她堅決地拒絕了。她的意思是兒子們都還沒有自立成人，她要等她的五十歲再說……</p>
<p>…眼前她的五十歲壽辰也逼近了。她的兒子們不但沒有替她掃眉吐氣，反而累她操勞担心；在這十年之中，我的多病，還常常使她地第人家深夜不眠呢！</p>
<p>…在十四歲那年，我竟會生起成年人的病「神經喪弱」來了。在十五歲那年我在腮下生了一個瘡，利害得把整個頭面都紅腫了起來。父親抱着我從一位姓顧的醫生那裏開了刀回來，瘡的膿血把我的內衣濕透了，但是我的知覺毫無。等我昏昏醒來，母親正點着香燭，在我的床邊，祈禱着神明。</p>
<p>「姆媽，我好會起來的。」</p>
<p>她連連點着頭，眼淚流下來了。</p>
<p>…在這幾年中，由於我的多病，使她消瘦得多了。她是一個不會吃素的人，她老是對外婆訴着苦：「呌我吃素眞要命，我良心好些就是了。」但是在前三年，她却許了一個願。吃起「九皇素」來了。我看她吃九皇素眞是不很容易，用筷支着飯碗，不能把飯嚥下去。我幾次勸她開了葷吧，她都不理睬我。最後，我把一塊肉丟到她的飯碗裏去，她銳聲地喊了起來：</p>
<p>「許了願可以隨便開戒的麼？……三年，你就可以無病無痛了」唉，偉大的母愛！</p>
<p>…其間，我離開了他半年，她差不多每隔二三天給我一封信，字是父親寫的，句子上的意思大多是她的：冷熱要當心，飮食要當心，交友要當心……重重複複是差不多的意思。</p>
<p>等我出其不意回來的時候，她快活得流下淚來。在吃晚飯的時候，她去喊了一只菜菜，一筷一筷的送到我碗監裏，當我客人似的，一面慢慢地問着我路途上的情形。</p>
<p>她這麼愛讓着我們，一年一年消瘦了，老了，頭上新添白髪了；她是用着自己的生命來栽培着我們。她每日每日在生命的路途幸苦上跋涉着，幾時可以由她的兒子們替她造下一所比較理想的「樂園」，以養其天年呢？</p>
<p>…現在，她已經堅苦地爬到五十歲的生命計程碑了！謝謝天，以後讓她有一段康莊的大道吧。難道兒子們眞的是這樣不肖，忍心等她六十歲的時候，讓她說再等七十歲做壽的話？……</p>

<h3>申報盃籃球甲組已屆下半段　上週戰事起變化　本週有二場精彩比賽</h3>
<p>申報盃籃球開賽以來，已七週餘，尙餘二週，甲組即可全部結束，乙組則尙複決賽。目下甲組以汕隊之慘敗於華南，乃保持常勝者，厥惟華聯業一隊而已。而華聯之要　取錦標，以後尙須有三强相逢，即汕隊大華中北是也。緣該三隊雖均有敗績，但均爲有作爲之隊伍，華聯非謹慎應付，斷難直搗黃龍。好在該隊有指導張溎祥之智足多謀，我人當可鑒其有特殊之成績也。茲檢討上週甲組各戰成敗之關鍵。</p>
<p>十一月六日（週一）</p>
<p>華聯勝明星</p>
<p>此戰之勝負，全緊於實力之强弱，勝者邇埡極爲正常，敗者雖爲前進之隊，無舅各方面，尙較勝一籌。乃局勢遂成一面倒，華聯之方法進攻，更見進步。更以張顯崙足傷已愈，士氣更爲銳旺，明星始終居下風勢中奮勇作戰有足多者。</p>
<p>同仁V隊</p>
<p>上述二隊　有勝績，是役當有關於黃包喪進出，賽前一般以爲同仁勢可穩　，不料Ｖ隊有吳子彬之親臨督戰，附同仁之快攻，　其本身平時之慢仁雖較强，一時亦不易得手，過程一直緊張，最後勝負之判，還在V隊之稍形落後，面目相慌　所致。同仁雖勝，其演出反無平時仁妙，要亦以求勝心濃厚之反應。</p>
<p>十一月八日（週三）</p>
<p>大華勝華影</p>
<p>華影之最大缺點，爲隊員不能到齊，但此賽竟全部開到，任亞偉包松　舒通車　安　永湛高茫生，乃該隊最近理想之人選矣。惜乎任包等究以久疎於此，不免於合作方面，不能湊。大華一貫採人釘人戰術，終屬先盛後衰，實基於一二人之長力不逮，而露出破綻。華影能知所以破敵之法，而未能行者，乃爲失敗之主因。相差分數極少，可見華影如多練習，當可更上一層</p>
<p>華南勝汕隊</p>
<p>汕隊旣有能力壓倒中北，視之以勝華南，似可應無疑議。但事實憶昭，汕隊敗於華南手下。故預料之戰績，已起變化。觀汕隊之敗，厥爲墨守陳法，一貫到底所軩害。果爾，該隊在此戰中，確已做到守的鎭靜，守的成功，此亦爲未能隨機應變。當在分數一落後之後，探悉時間所餘不多，亟應改變策略，利用猛迫之人釘人。況該隊隊員俱有充沛之長力，奈何汕隊健兒不此之圖，而終遭慘敗。惜哉！就華南之勝，在乎勇與熟二條件，何金貴之最後敢試竄進，連獲二球，得以奠定勝局，允稱大將之材。華南小將有，入不餒之精神，前途燦爛。</p>
<p>十一月十日（週五）</p>
<p>中北勝仁餘</p>
<p>事前必以爲一面倒之球賽，初不料仁餘個人及全隊俱見卯上，李　和最爲神妙，陳渭源大將風度，夏澤人返老還童，故中北始終在苦鬥之下，調兵遣將，煞費心血，直至最後，中北改聯防爲釘人後，始見穎而上，相差仍極微，數據庫見仁餘之努力。由此以觀，球隊非必需拉攏名將，首重肯虛心上進，觀乎仁餘在申報盃之過去戰績，決不信其戰中北有如此之作爲。</p>
<p>汕隊勝明星</p>
<p>汕隊鑒於慘　敗在華南之手，林作詩心有領會，故戰策改變，以人釘人施用，固未見爐火純靑。然初試之作，可稱滿意。明星以健將缺席，以故更無法竄上，最後更以范熙榮罰出，無人替補，乃使林維聰如入無人之境，故不足多評矣。</p>
<p>本週秩序二場好戲</p>
<p>聯賽旣屆下半段，自爾逐見精彩。一爲週三（十五日）華聯逢汕隊，後者如能取得勝利，前途尙有希望，成敗有關錦標。且該隊日來臥薪書胆，雄　果不因收於華南而灰心。前者則鶴立雞羣，尙保持處女之身，爲山九仞，決不願功虧一簣。一場龍虎鬥，球賽必精彩，球房必傾翻。另場爲週五（十七日）中北與大華之戰，兩隊麾下均爲沙場老將，個人挍術，勝人一等。而大華有百樂門之色彩。中北似遞承以前華聯之作風，數年之前，南北大戰，猶榮腦際，則此一幕比賽，亦可爲本屆之南北大戰矣，值得一觀。</p>

<h3>籃球學理述要（四）</h3>
<p>— 梁兆安</p>
<p>（乙）傳球</p>
<p>傳球技術，幾與籃同等重要；最使人失望，及失去一隊之威嚴者，莫過於傳球技術欠佳。傳球持術亞劣之結果。不祇影響全隊合作精神，與進攻呆滯，更使同隊隊員燥急。以致動作愈　粗野，因而犯規壘壘，全隊受人輕視，並可予對方獲分更多之機會。反言之，若一隊之傳球挍術高妙，除增加本隊隊員之自信心外，進攻敏捷，獲勝機會在捏而觀衆亦必寄予好感也。</p>
<p>在比賽中，雖各種傳球法均可應用，但指導員，應先決定某種傳法，爲最適合其本隊之戰略；便如短跑離傳球之戰法，宜用單手或雙手低傳，長跑離球之戰法，宜用「鈎手」或擲壘球式之傳球法等。</p>
<p>傳球練習法，可有種種不同方式，惟最要緊者，須使練習者發生興趣；練習時間，不可太　　球員練習一小時投籃，不會感覺乏味，但練習十五分鐘傳球，即使其厭倦。總之無論採取何種練習法，應使球員養成走前接球之習慣，絕不應許球員站立等傳球來。</p>
<p>基本傳球法，種類頗多。現將其常用之幾種，如鈎手傳，　壘球式傳，雙手低傳，變手胸傳，及單手低傳等法略述于後。</p>
<p>（一）鈎手傳球法</p>
<p>此種傳法，頗爲重要，一經熟習，傳出必甚準確，但滬上球員用之甚少；此種傳法係在對方頭上傳過去，使對方後面之本隊隊員接得之；最適宜行之於正在離開對方防守者之時。傳球時，左脚應先踏出一步，右脚隨之提起繞向左方，同時使身體躍起，向左方轉身。當足部跳起凌空時之，右手握球，伸直向上繞圈，至高出肩部與頭部時，將球傳出；球傳出之際，手肘宜稍彎曲，用手腕用手指壓力，將球擲下，使球易接；身體落地時，應向球傳出之方向站立。如係用左手傳球，其方向適與此相反行之。</p>
<p>（二）擲壘球式傳法</p>
<p>此種傳法，完全與擲壘球之姿勢無異，係宜於遠跑離，傳玌正在橫術向前投籃之同伴時，尤其是在接球者與籃之間，未有敵人所在之時。但此種傳法，必須迅速而準確，幷須有　十分把握，方可實行，故非熱習不易奏效。</p>
<p>（三）手低傳法</p>
<p>因此種法，簡單易行，故球隊用之最廣。又因此種傳法，握球姿勢。與接球時之握法，不用更改，所以便於投籃，傳出，故佈疑陣驅敵，或擾亂對方防守現綫等種種動作。其優點之多，實駕乎其他傳球法。</p>
<p>此種傳球之正確握球法，係用兩手手指檢量張開，握球之兩邊，但不能握得太緊，太緊則不靈活，又不能握得太鬆，太鬆則易脫落，必須兩手用力平均而柔順，握球時應常放在腹間，身體稍向前彎曲，以掩護球之被對方搶奪，傳出時應從身旁傳出，以一手移放在身邊後方，另一手放在身前握球傳</p>
<p>（四）雙手胸傳</p>
<p>滬上球隊員慣用此法者最多：此種傳法，除傳時用雙手手腕及手指力，在胸部推出外，其餘握球姿勢，完全與雙手低傳法無異；但其優點比雙手傳法還勝一籌，在於傳出時更爲靈活與迅速也。</p>
<h3>宣家組織之　同仁隊</h3>
<p>— 鴛</p>
<p>同仁籃球隊，人稱之謂「宣家班」，蓋以宣家叔姪爲班底也、該隊領隊爲　元驊與宣艾侯，　君爲宣家舅父，任職永豐金號，宣君任上海銀行調查部經理，均熱心提倡體育。隊員宣通爲宣家之叔，在華東大學肄業。宣和任職正金銀行，宣義任成豐錢莊經理，宣揚就業於聖約翰大學，宣後身體欠和，遵醫之　暫不參加比賽。其他隊員爲蔣叔良，係保險從業員、陸大振方從北京來滬能加。全隊作戰時，極盡球藝之表演，技術均在水平以上。運動道德極佳，不以勝負爲對象。前在西靑聯賽中，曾壓倒東方及蒙諾克兩隊。此次參加申報杯賽，表演頗爲觀衆所讚賞，宣通獲分最多。</p>

<h3>Imperial Edict from the Japanese Emperor: Commending the Army and Navy in China; General President Koiso's Message of Gratitude to the Expeditionary Force</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 5:30 PM on the 11th that the Emperor summoned the two chiefs of staff of the Imperial Headquarters and issued the following Imperial Edict to the Commander-in-Chief of the China Expeditionary Force and the Commander of the China Area Fleet: Officers and men of the operating forces in Central and Southern China, for half a year, daring to venture into malarial regions, performing extremely difficult mobile operations, enduring great hardships, everywhere crushing the bases of the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing, and achieving operational objectives to contribute to the overall war effort. I deeply commend this.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Japanese General President Koiso of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, upon the Japanese army's occupation of Guilin, sent the following message of gratitude on the 11th to the Supreme Commander of the China Area Expeditionary Force: Enemy forces from the American counteroffensive from mainland China, having conducted aerial attacks on the Japanese mainland and responding with offensives in the Pacific centered on the Philippines, have repeatedly engaged in reckless and foolish actions. In this critical situation, thanks to the brave fighting and endeavors of the Japanese army, the largest American air base on the mainland in Guilin has finally been occupied, a resounding victory that is unprecedented. Its significance is even greater. The people in the rear are deeply grateful. From now on, all of our citizens must do their best to increase production of the tools of victory to thank the soldiers on the front lines for their military success and to express our respect.</p>
<h3>Announcement from the Japanese Imperial Headquarters: Occupation of Liuzhou and Guilin; Chongqing Suffers a Major Blow</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:30 PM on the 11th: (1) The Japanese army began operations in Central China in late May and in Southern China in late June. At 10:00 AM on the 10th, Liuzhou was completely captured, and at 12:00 PM, Guilin was also completely captured, reducing the U.S. Air Force base cluster in that area, thereby gaining a strategic advantage on the Chinese mainland. (2) The supreme commander of the Japanese army units in that area is General Yasuji Okamura. The commander of the naval units is Admiral Shiro Takasu. The commander of the Japanese army units in Central China is Lieutenant General Isamu Yokoyama. The supreme commander of the Japanese army in Southern China is Lieutenant General Hisaichi Tanaka. The commander of the naval units is Vice Admiral Daisuke Soejima. The commander of the army air force units is Lieutenant General Takuo Yamashita.</p>
<p>Guangxi Front Lines, 11th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Japanese army that entered the city of Guilin launched fierce street battles starting on the morning of the 10th. At noon on the 10th, the city of Guilin was completely occupied, and the Chongqing army's 31st Army surrendered completely.</p>
<p>Extremely Important Significance</p>
<p>A Certain Base in Guangxi, 11th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – With the occupation of Guilin and Liuzhou by the Japanese army, this Japanese offensive, sweeping through the Central Plains of mainland China in just half a year, is rare in world military history. The final stage of this operation has now come to an end, marking the beginning of a decisive battle. This offensive holds great significance and purpose in both political and military strategy. From a strategic standpoint, it thoroughly shattered the central war zones of the Chongqing resistance in Henan, Hunan, and Guangxi, as well as their roots of development, cutting China into east and west, and depriving it of the ability to coordinate with the American counteroffensive in the Pacific, inflicting a severe blow on the Chongqing side. Furthermore, it forced the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing to retreat inland, which has a strategic significance. One can easily glimpse this by observing the American counteroffensive in the Philippines. At the same time, the sharpness of the Japanese offensive did not diminish despite capturing Guilin and Liuzhou. From there, it can now point to Kunming, the base of the U.S. Air Force, and Chongqing, the capital of the resistance. Today, the threat to the enemy camp is increasingly severe. The fact that Stilwell was recalled earlier fully hints at the inside story of the Chongqing-U.S. relationship, with the United States intending to interfere in Chongqing's internal affairs to achieve its long-cherished desire. Therefore, the Chongqing side has been subjected to strong pressure from both internal and external sources, and has encountered the greatest crisis since the start of the war of resistance, which goes without saying.</p>
<p>Chongqing Army Division Commander Killed in Action</p>
<p>Guangxi Front Lines, 11th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – According to the confession of Xie Chen, a deputy platoon leader of the machine gun squad of the Chongqing 131st Division, captured during the fall of Guilin, it has been confirmed that the commander of the Chongqing 131st Division was indeed killed in action.</p>
<h3>Director Matsushima Discusses the Pacific War Situation: American Actions Will Become Increasingly Difficult</h3>
<p>Colonel Matsushima, the director of the press department of the Japanese Fleet in China, met with a group of Chinese reporters in Shanghai on the 11th and made the following statement:</p>
<p>Due to the retreat of the enemy fleet, the maritime situation in the Philippines area is currently stable. However, given the enemy's situation in the Mariana and New Guinea areas, the enemy may implement new plans. The strength of the remaining American fleet is obviously extremely weak. Even if the U.S. can draw some reinforcements from the Atlantic, the strength of aircraft carriers, the center of naval operations, is extremely low. It is increasingly clear that American operations will become more difficult in the future. In the land battles on Leyte Island, the Japanese army has decisively adopted an active offensive, joining forces with naval and land-based air units to destroy the enemy. The enemy is clearly pouring all its strength into overcoming this difficult obstacle, so the critical juncture of the current war situation can be said to be in the next few months.</p>
<p>Wallace's reappointment to Chongqing is presumably to ease the sharpened Chongqing-U.S. feelings after the earlier recall of Stilwell and to use the development of the Northwest as bait to tie down Chongqing's will to fight. The great success of the Japanese army's railways in the Pacific and on the mainland is expected to make the United States engage in more diplomatic intrigue in the future, using political means to win over Chongqing.</p>
<p>The first essential of war is to destroy the enemy. Whether or not Roosevelt succeeds in being elected for a fourth term is originally not a problem for Japan. From our point of view, the survival of the chief culprit of the Greater East Asia War in a position of responsibility, so that we can fully inflict a painful blow on him, is most welcome. It is deeply believed that the Japanese people's will to fight will therefore be even stronger.</p>
<p>New American Mobile Unit</p>
<p>Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The strength of U.S. aircraft carriers has suffered significant damage due to the air battles over Taiwan and the naval battle in the Philippine Sea. Therefore, a new mobile unit was reorganized at the beginning of this week and dispatched again to the eastern waters of the Philippines to carry out attacks by carrier-based aircraft on the Philippines. However, its scale is extremely scattered and disorganized. Therefore, last week, it sought to strengthen the base air units in the Wakde area in order to cooperate with operations in the Philippines and launch strategic bombing. The actions of its mobile units have recently been quite cautious. The mobile unit that acted rashly in the eastern waters of the Philippines at the beginning of this week retreated from the waters near the Philippines after carrying out a weak attack. This was due to fear of attacks by Japanese naval air units. After losing one aircraft carrier, it felt extremely panicked. It is greatly conserving the remaining aircraft carrier group to cope with future developments in the war. Now, the initiative in the decisive battle between Japan and the U.S. in the Pacific has been completely transferred to the hands of the Japanese army.</p>
<p>Japanese Aircraft Bomb Tacloban</p>
<p>Manila, 11th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Japanese air units bombed Tacloban Airport at dawn on the 10th, causing fires in three locations. Also on the same day, in aerial combat, 14 P-38 aircraft were shot down and two were destroyed.</p>
<p>Commemoration of the Father of the Nation's Birthday Held Throughout the Country Today; Central Authorities Pay Respects at the Mausoleum</p>
<p>Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The 12th is the birthday of the Father of the Nation. Solemn commemorations are being prepared throughout the country. The central authorities have also decided to have all members of the Central Committee and heads of various Yuan, ministries, and commissions pay respects at the Mausoleum of the Father of the Nation at 10:00 AM on the morning of that day, offering wreaths to express their remembrance. Afterwards, they will also go to Linggu Temple to pay tribute to the martyrs of the National Revolution and Japanese comrades who aided the Chinese Revolution. Hereby, we deeply know that the people of the country, in addition to solemn commemoration, can better recognize the environment, understand the difficulties of the times, and unite more closely, marching towards the complete destruction of the common enemies of Britain and the United States and the accomplishment of the Greater East Asia War, in order to realize the Father of the Nation's ideal of Pan-Asianism. We pray for China's early revival, the early liberation of East Asia, and further the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, contributing to world prosperity.</p>
<p>Weekly Commentary</p>
<h3>Commemorating the Revolutionary Spirit of the Father of the Nation</h3>
<p>— Liren</p>
<p>Today is the 79th anniversary of the birth of the Father of the Nation. At a time when Pan-Asianism is spreading throughout the Greater East Asia region, remembering our predecessors and building on their legacy, the so-called "glorifying the profound laws of our ancestors and raising the voice of the great Han people," truly evokes endless feelings!</p>
<p>The revolutionary spirit of the Father of the Nation lives on in our hearts. How should we commemorate him with the right actions?</p>
<p>The Father of the Nation said it well: "If a thing is in accordance with the laws of nature, in accordance with human feelings, in accordance with the trends of the world, in accordance with the needs of the people, and is determined and carried out by those who are wise and insightful, then there is no reason why it should not succeed. This is the case with the revolutionary, reformist, nation-building, and state-building undertakings of ancient and modern times." The life of the wise and insightful Father of the Nation is almost the entirety of the history of revolution. His birth was not far from the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Revolution and the most heinous Opium War of British imperialism. He witnessed the corruption of the Qing court, the increasingly urgent trend of British imperialist aggression, and the nation already tending towards extreme danger, knowing that overthrowing the Qing court and establishing a new Republic was necessary to save the country. His immortal achievements in revolutionary practice are: first, the success of the Xinhai Revolution; second, the continuous strengthening of the Kuomintang. In addition, his expressions in thought are: first, advocating the doctrine of "action is easy, knowledge is difficult"; second, the establishment of the theoretical system of the Three Principles of the People; third, the formulation of the National Reconstruction Program, the National Reconstruction Outline, and the Industrial Plan.</p>
<p>The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Revolution, which began in 1851, occupied as many as seventeen provinces at the time, and had hundreds of thousands of soldiers. However, in less than fourteen years, it came to a complete and resounding end, suffering the most tragic failure in the history of revolution. What was the reason for this? The biggest reason was the lack of a great and wise leader in the revolutionary process to lead it correctly.</p>
<p>The Father of the Nation, with his great personality, correct ideas, and even more with his firm spirit, led the revolution throughout his life, creating the Republic of China—this journey was painful and difficult. He was worthy of being a true revolutionary leader.</p>
<p>His revolution was resolute and thorough, all based on the standpoint of the people. In order to expand the revolutionary forces, he also secretly promoted revolutionary ideas in many folk secret societies. There is such a passage in his autobiography (National Reconstruction Program): "…The Hongmen was founded by the Ming Dynasty loyalists, starting in the Kangxi period. Before Kangxi, many Ming loyalists and martyrs worked hard to restore the country, vowing not to be subjects of the Qing. By Kangxi, the situation was already strong. The two or three remaining elders, seeing that the general trend was gone, wanted to pass on the seeds of nationalism to future generations. With the aim of overthrowing the Qing and restoring the Ming, they formed a group to await the rise of future generations… It must be the most popular deeds that conform to the psychology of the masses that convey the ideas of the nation and the state. The Hongmen worships by performing plays, and the slogans and secret words are expressed in vulgar and crude language… The need for future unity is only for the connection of brothers in times of trouble. The political meaning is completely lost… People in the secret societies have weak knowledge and loose organizations. They only hope to be a response and cannot be used as a driving force."</p>
<p>How enlightening is his precise and profound insight. Indeed, in the era of the Revive China Society, he went deep into the secret societies, organized them, and utilized them. But by the time of the Tongmenghui, he had established a vast revolutionary party and set up many newspapers and magazines to engage in propaganda. He recognized that revolution was a cause of the masses and never regarded himself as a party leader, not seeing himself as a hero. Originally, when he was building his ideas, traveling around Hong Kong, Japan, Europe, and the United States, promoting his theories, the overseas Chinese all regarded him as a ferocious beast. The Father of the Nation did not yield or flinch, but continued to work hard, gradually gaining many comrades. In the military actions of the revolution, he did not know how many setbacks he had gone through, but he did not waver in the slightest. His most obvious military failures were ten:</p>
<p>The first failure—setting up the Agricultural Society in Guangzhou as an organization. At that time, Deng Yin'nan, Yang Hengyun, Huang Yongshang, and Chen Shaobai were assisting in the cadre affairs, while Lu Haodong and Zheng Shiliang were helping with planning. He himself often went to work between Guangzhou and Hong Kong, preparing very thoroughly, and the momentum was extremely strong. However, due to carelessness in moving weapons, the customs seized more than 600 pistols, and the plan was leaked. Lu Haodong died for it.</p>
<p>The second failure—in the Gengzi Uprising, the comrades in Guangzhou repeatedly plotted, and Shi Jianru decided to use explosives to attack and destroy the Governor-General's Office of Guangdong and Guangxi. The explosion failed, and Shi was killed.</p>
<p>The third failure—the Father of the Nation left Japan and went to Annam with Hu Hanmin and Wang Jingwei, setting up an organization in Hanoi, and then launched the Chaozhou Huanggang Uprising, which was unfavorable.</p>
<p>The fourth failure—ordering Deng Ziyu and others to revolt in Huizhou, which failed.</p>
<p>The fifth failure—the revolutionary army entered Yuanlingshan, but it was difficult to advance due to its weakness, and then retreated into the Shiwan Mountains.</p>
<p>The sixth failure—only a hundred or so people held on to the Sanpaotai, jointly attacking Longzhou, and retreated into Annam.</p>
<p>After six failures, Wang Jingwei felt extremely indignant, so he and several comrades plotted to assassinate the Prince Regent. Unfortunately, one strike missed, and he was arrested and imprisoned. He was released until the Wuchang Uprising.</p>
<p>The seventh failure—Huang Keqiang and others left Annam with more than two hundred people, roaming the Qinlian area, and withdrew when support was cut off.</p>
<p>The eighth failure—Huang Mingtang and others attacked Hekou. The Qing army was ten times larger than the revolutionary army, and Huang led more than a hundred people to retreat into Annam.</p>
<p>The ninth failure—using the Guangzhou New Army to launch an uprising, Ni Yingdian led his troops to attack the provincial capital from Shahe, but was intercepted at Hengzhigang.</p>
<p>After these nine defeats, the Father of the Nation made an appointment with Huang Keqiang, Hu Hanmin, and others in Yokohama to discuss a comeback. The comrades said that the newly received troops were exhausted, and many of the New Army who fled south had no extra energy to receive and settle down. The comrades were worried about their living and moving expenses, and their future was unbearable. The Father of the Nation asked about future plans, and they all sighed. The Father of the Nation comforted them and said: "The first few failures were almost universally ridiculed. After several struggles, falling and then getting up again, we have created a change in the thinking of the masses. They are looking forward to continuing the struggle. From now on, what we should worry about is only our lack of plans and lack of courage!" The Father of the Nation then returned to Hong Kong, striving to raise funds, explaining the great righteousness, and jointly carrying out the great cause.</p>
<p>The final fight—on March 29th of the Xinhai year, Guangzhou gathered elites from various provinces to launch an uprising, but unfortunately it became the tenth failure. However, the revolutionary situation could no longer be suppressed.</p>
<p>Failure is the mother of success. How did the Father of the Nation's spirit gain a more determined and lofty idea after each failure? How did he gain a layer of experience after each setback?</p>
<p>Finally, the Wuchang Uprising broke out. The Qing officials fled at the news, and even more obtained international sympathy. The provinces continued to respond, and within a few months, fifteen provinces were restored. Then the whole country changed flags, creating the brilliant Republic of China.</p>

<h3>Recent Rice Prices in Nanjing and Their Impact</h3>
<p>— Minxian</p>
<p>Recently, rice prices in Shanghai have soared, exceeding 20,000 yuan per picul, which has stimulated a general rise in prices, causing great hardship to the people. However, rice prices in Nanjing have consistently hovered around 6,000 yuan, more than three times lower than those in Shanghai. The reporter, in order to understand the truth, made an on-site investigation.</p>

<p>General prices in Nanjing, such as cloth, cosmetics, and daily necessities from overseas, are greatly affected by Shanghai. However, although the prices of these goods have risen following the news from Shanghai, they have not attracted much attention due to the people's lack of purchasing power. For example, the newly opened Fuxing, Jiankang, Yong'an, Dahuab department stores are mostly deserted, with a very desolate atmosphere. The central department store on Zhonghua Road, which was established the longest, has as much as three-quarters of its space empty, a sign of the cold business. Secondly, food prices are almost all half the price of those in Shanghai. For example, pancakes and fried dough sticks sell for five yuan apiece, and are no smaller than those in Shanghai. Forty yuan can buy a large bowl of meat noodles, and Yangchun noodles only cost twenty yuan a bowl. If you eat meals at a mid-sized restaurant, two meals a day with unlimited rice costs only 2,800 yuan per month. This kind of price is probably impossible even in low-end stalls in Shanghai. Hotel room rates are also about the same as they were two months ago. Therefore, the current living conditions of the people in Nanjing seem to be much more stable than those in Shanghai. In short, if food prices do not fluctuate greatly, then the threat to life will not be too serious. Currently, the black market rice price in Nanjing is 6,300 yuan per picul of white rice, and 40 yuan per catty of local noodles.</p>
<p>Rice Procurement Situation</p>
<p>In order to understand the recent rice procurement situation in Nanjing, the reporter visited the Nanjing office of the Rice Control Association. According to Mr. Jia Pinshan, the deputy director of the office, the rice procurement area in the Nanjing district includes five counties: Jiangning, Jurong, Lishui, Jiangpu, and Liuhe. At present, only Jiangning, Jurong, and Lishui counties can actually procure rice. This is because Jiangpu produces only enough rice for its own consumption. In the past, rice from Jiangpu was entirely transshipped from Quanjiao and other counties in Anhui, but now, for some reason, rice cannot be transported. The rice produced in Liuhe County is not enough for the county's own needs. Fortunately, the procurement results are not too bad. Since the start of procurement work on September 20, 40,000 piculs have already been delivered to the warehouse, and procurement contracts have been signed for about 80,000 piculs. In the future, we will continue to actively procure rice. The people of Nanjing are allocated a total of 60,000 piculs of rice per month, plus several thousand piculs allocated to civil servants, requiring a total of about 70,000 piculs of rice per month. As long as no special difficulties occur in the future, we should be able to supply it on a monthly basis without delay. As for the rice hawkers, each is allowed to transport eight kilograms into the city, and some even transport it several times a day, which is quite considerable. Most of them are concentrated in places such as the Dazhong Bridge for sale. The black market rice price in Nanjing cannot be too high, and these rice hawkers have a considerable relationship. He also said that when procuring rice, there are very few township chiefs and self-defense groups in various places who do not demand bribes, which is very troublesome. Mr. Jia was originally a rice merchant and is also the chairman of the Nanjing Miscellaneous Grain Industry Association. His official talk seems to be somewhat different. (Sent from Nanjing)</p>

<h3>Today is the Birthday of the Founding Father, the City Celebrates Solemnly; Memorial Services Held by All Sectors in the Morning</h3>
<p>Today is the anniversary of the birth of the Founding Father. In order to solemnly commemorate the event, the city will fly flags to celebrate. All sectors of the city will hold a memorial service at the Da Guangming Cinema at 9:00 AM. Participants from all sectors include civil servants, Baojia personnel, youth groups, party members, military police, and representatives of public groups, totaling approximately 2,000 people.

The Municipal Propaganda Office also hung red cloth banners across streets in major streets in various districts to commemorate the event, and posted colorful commemorative slogans on the walls in various districts.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Raided Shanghai This Morning, Forcefully Repelled; Our Side Suffered Very Minor Damage</h3>
<p>Shanghai Army and Navy Press Department, November 11, 12:40 PM: "Today (November 11) at 8:50 AM, several enemy B-29 aircraft invaded the Shanghai area in waves and dropped bombs on several places in the suburbs. They were repelled by our air defense forces and ground forces. Our side suffered very minor damage."</p>
<p>Statement by Minister Matsushima</p>
<p>This morning at 8:50 AM, several enemy B-29 aircraft invaded Shanghai and dropped bombs in the suburbs. I have repeatedly said before that this kind of action by enemy aircraft is of no value in the battles of the Greater East Asia War, but is merely a means of psychological warfare. It is understood that enemy aircraft raided Japan this morning, so the enemy aircraft raiding Shanghai seemed to be restraining and echoing. This kind of blind air raid is meaningless strategically and worthless in terms of the overall situation. However, we should be especially cautious about the enemy's rash actions in the future and prepare thoroughly. During the air raid alarm, the actions of the citizens of this city have not yet complied with the authorities' repeated instructions, which is very regrettable. According to reports so far, shrapnel from anti-aircraft guns grazed pedestrians at the intersection of Taixing Road and Kangding Road (formerly Route Matteerhurst and Connaught Road), causing minor casualties. Two people died, two were seriously injured, and thirteen were slightly injured. All were Chinese, who suffered this misfortune because they did not know how to prepare for the air raid. In this decisive stage, air raids are expected, but they are unavoidable in order to win victory. Most citizens of Shanghai still believe that Shanghai will not be affected by the war. This view is completely wrong. In the future, I hope that citizens will become more aware and more active.</p>
<p>Air Defense Headquarters Warns Citizens</p>
<p>The Citizens' Air Defense Headquarters issued a statement yesterday regarding the enemy aircraft's raid on Shanghai, saying: "Today's air raid on Shanghai by several B-29 enemy aircraft can be said to be the only means by which the enemy attempts to break the deadlock in the East Asian war. We have repeatedly warned the public. This morning's news of air raids in Japan echoed the air raids in this city. This move by the enemy is partly a restraint and partly a reconnaissance. Their indiscriminate bombing has no strategic value, but is merely intended to shock the nerves of the citizens of Shanghai. From the perspective of the overall war situation, it is also meaningless. However, the citizens of this city should be more prepared for this kind of attempt by the enemy in the future. The actions of the citizens during the issuance of the air raid alarm have not complied with the authorities' instructions, which is very regrettable. Citizens are either walking on the road or lingering outside the house, lacking any sense of urgency, which will inevitably lead to self-inflicted casualties. Special attention must be paid to this point.</p>
<p>We are currently in a decisive period, and air raids and other actions are a matter of course. If we want to defeat the enemy and win, we must break the idea that Shanghai is outside the war. Citizens must deeply understand the truth of the war situation and unite to protect themselves."</p>
<p>Must Take Shelter During Air Raids</p>
<p>The Citizens' Air Defense Headquarters authorities issued the following statement yesterday:</p>
<p>On the morning of the 11th of this month, enemy B-29 aircraft invaded the Shanghai area and carried out wave-like air raids. However, the enemy did not achieve much because it was subjected to fierce anti-aircraft fire from the Japanese army and navy air defense and ground units. It was merely a blind bombing for psychological warfare, and then it fled. This air raid was a guerrilla raid due to the pressure of the Pacific War. From the perspective of the future war situation, this type of air raid by the enemy on the Shanghai area is extremely easy, so it is not surprising at all in wartime.</p>
<p>It is extremely regrettable that some citizens were injured during today's air raid, but it can be called fortunate among misfortunes that so few were injured. Originally, during air raids, enemy aircraft drop bombs first, and our anti-aircraft fire also begins to fire, and it is not uncommon for shrapnel from the explosion of shells to fall. Therefore, the Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Command previously issued the following announcement:</p>
<p>During the issuance of an air raid alarm, except for those who are actually engaged in air defense work, all must take shelter in air raid shelters or suitable shelters in buildings. However, there were many useless people outside today who did not take shelter, so they were injured by shrapnel, and the misfortune was self-inflicted. When enemy aircraft are overhead, citizens should take shelter in the recessed areas of buildings to avoid unexpected disasters. At the current stage of the war, citizens must fully understand the methods of taking shelter and not panic or cause commotion during air raids, but implement their predetermined actions. Therefore, we hope that citizens will receive more training and express our deep gratitude to the air defense self-defense team members who have been working bravely under the enemy's blind bombing today.</p>
<h3>Naval Baojia Area Holds Aircraft Dedication and Naming Ceremony at the Racecourse at 10:00 AM Today</h3>

<h3>Director Guo Talks About Punishing Police Officers</h3>
<p>Guo Shaoyi, Director of the Supervisory Office of the Municipal Police Bureau, attended the 27th regular press conference the other day and answered reporters' questions about the issue of police extortion. The details have already been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. According to what Mr. Guo said, an average of 50 people are punished every day for verified illegal behaviors. However, this number of punishments is calculated together with offenses such as dereliction of duty, and is not solely due to punishment for extortion. Due to omissions in the record, there may be misunderstandings, so this is a supplementary note.</p>

<h3>Guilin and Liuzhou Fall, Enemy's American Attempt to Smash; Statement by Minister Izubuchi</h3>
<p>Minister Izubuchi of the Allied Chinese Dispatch Army Shanghai Army Press Department issued the following statement after the Japanese army occupied Guilin:</p>
<p>"The fall of Guilin and Liuzhou is of great significance. The enemy's American air force attempted to invade the Japanese mainland from the Chinese mainland, so they spent two years building aviation fortresses in the southwest region, which have now collapsed. Our strategic line in Greater East Asia has been strengthened with its invincible and unyielding strength, and the Pacific war situation has undergone a major transformation, with the important significance of a shift to the offensive.</p>
<p>The Real Enemies Are Only Britain and the United States</p>
<p>At the beginning of this major operation, the Imperial Government issued a statement saying: "The real enemies are only Britain and the United States. If the Chongqing soldiers and civilians can realize that they should not cooperate with Britain and the United States and come to us, then they are not enemies." Our operations have always been based on the spirit of this statement and have thoroughly adopted moral actions. The Chongqing regime has now lost most of Henan Province and the entire Hunan Province. This time, it has lost the important strongholds of Guilin and Liuzhou in Guangxi, and its war power has been greatly depleted under the iron hammer of the Imperial Army. The Chongqing authorities previously allowed the enemy Americans to establish base groups in the southwest region with Guilin and Hengyang as the center in an attempt to introduce the enemy American air force's power into the Chinese mainland, thereby threatening the Japanese mainland. The Chongqing army cooperated with the enemy American army in China and served as its vanguard, making useless resistance. The Chongqing army has now repeated the tragedies of Changsha, Hengyang, Wuzhou, and Guiping first, and then the tragedies of Guilin and Liuzhou. Now we are determined to punish them severely and make them realize it. But what we find sad is that the people of Hunan and Guangxi provinces are displaced and their families are destroyed. However, based on the great spirit of our army in this operation, we will never harm innocent Chinese civilians and will do our best to protect them. The enemy American air force in China is inhuman, adopting a scorched earth strategy, turning cities into ashes, and destroying cultural undertakings. They previously carried out cruel bombing atrocities against the lost cities of Changsha and Hengyang, and this time they carried out extensive bombing of Guilin and Liuzhou. Taking Wuzhou as an example, the enemy American air force used machine guns to strafe and kill Chinese civilians who were fleeing. We express our extreme indignation at this kind of atrocity by the enemy Americans and feel extremely lamentable for the enemy Americans' cruelty. It is extremely regrettable that the Chongqing authorities continue to cooperate with Britain and the United States, making it impossible for the Chinese people to escape this unfortunate situation.</p>
<h3>Education Bureau Summoned Teachers and Staff of Various Schools Yesterday for Instructions and Invited Minister Matsushima to Give a Lecture</h3>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau summoned teachers and staff of public and private primary and secondary schools in the city to the Yucai Middle School auditorium on Shanhai Pass Road yesterday (11th) for instructions, and invited Minister Matsushima, the press officer of the Allied Japanese Fleet stationed in China, to give a lecture. He analyzed the enemy aircraft's raid on Shanghai and the war situation in the Philippine Islands since October 10 in great detail. Then, Director Dai gave instructions, which were divided into three points: (1) Take on the mission of the era, (2) Work hard in one's own position, (3) Create a good academic atmosphere, etc., and reported on the general situation of education in the city in the past two months.</p>
<p>Short Commentary</p>
<h3>Pay Attention to Air Defense Safety</h3>
<p>When enemy aircraft raided the city yesterday morning, stray bullets from anti-aircraft guns grazed pedestrians at the intersection of Taixing Road and Kangding Road. In this wartime, enemy air raids were originally expected, and the air defense authorities have repeatedly instructed the public on how to take shelter. For the safety of citizens in the future, we propose two things that should be paid attention to:</p>
<p>(1) We hope that citizens will remain calm and take good care of themselves during air raids. Panic is unnecessary, but frivolity is also inappropriate. For example, when anti-aircraft guns were firing at enemy aircraft, most citizens regarded it as a spectacle, standing on rooftops or gathering at windows, looking up and pointing, and turning a deaf ear to the advice of air defense personnel. This kind of careless action is extremely easy to be injured by stray bullets and is also a reconnaissance target. Attention should be paid to this in the future.</p>
<p>(2) During air raids, passersby should immediately take shelter in nearby alleys or buildings for safety. It is heard that some alleys close their iron gates at the entrance when an alarm is sounded, and some buildings close their iron gates on holidays, making it impossible for passersby to take shelter. This should be corrected in terms of air defense. The air defense authorities or police authorities should notify the gatekeepers of alleys and buildings to pay attention, and the air defense and Baojia personnel should patrol and pay attention during air raids.</p>

<h3>Elderly Care Home Urgent Appeal, Hoping to Continue Donations; Fanqintang Generously Donates 500,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>The Nanshi Elderly Care Home's donation campaign, which started on October 10th and lasted for one month, was collected by this newspaper on behalf of the home. We are deeply grateful for the enthusiastic support of people from all walks of life. The original donation target was 5 million yuan, but only half of that has been reached in the past month. According to a letter from the home, current prices are soaring, making it difficult to continue. Please continue to appeal, etc. At the same time, Fanqintang donated 500,000 yuan because the donation target had not been reached. Fanqintang has always been deeply involved in charitable causes. This generous donation will allow the elderly to live out their remaining years in comfort. Their willingness to help others is truly admirable. We hope that benevolent gentlemen will follow suit and reach the 5 million yuan target as soon as possible. It would be fortunate indeed.</p>

<h3>Record of Fierce Fighting by Japanese Soldiers in the Dense Jungles of New Guinea</h3>
<p>When the news came that some Japanese soldiers were still fighting bravely in difficult and arduous conditions on Guadalcanal Island, how amazed and excited we were! To this day, they are still monitoring the enemy's movements, and whenever they find a good opportunity, they force the enemy to shed a lot of blood. The arduous struggle of these brave warriors, and their lives in the deep and secluded jungles where even wild beasts do not dare to rest, tell us that living is more difficult than dying. Regarding the recent situation of the soldiers fighting fiercely in Rabaul, New Guinea, a report has recently been sent to the base, roughly as follows:</p>
<p>In the dense jungles of New Guinea, trees as tall as forty meters are very lush, blocking out the sun and sky. Being in them is like falling into a deep pit. Among them, one can sometimes see huge trees with trunk diameters of up to seven meters. Between the large trees, vines about two or three inches thick hang down, intertwined east and west, forming an impenetrable vine wall. To look up at the sky is truly unthinkable. Sunlight enters in a refracted manner from some unknown place, and the faint light is only enough to barely make out the surrounding scenery.</p>
<p>Moving Barracks With No Fixed Location</p>
<p>In such a place, the Japanese soldiers set up their barracks. But they cannot stay in a fixed location for long, because enemy planes fly and scout in the sky day and night. If they are found, they will be subjected to a fiery bombardment. The enemy relies not only on abundant weapons, but is also very timid. As long as they feel something is suspicious, they will spare no expense to drop steel and gunpowder. Therefore, the Japanese soldiers have to move constantly to prevent them from being detected. The so-called barracks are nothing more than a name. In reality, it is just a floor架擱 platform between four coconut trees, more than one and a half meters above the ground, with a roof made of grass and coconut leaves. The reason why the floor has to be so high is because the jungle is very humid, and it is easy to get sick if it is too low. When moving, they use the tents they carry with them to sleep on the fallen leaves. Moving in the middle of the jungle is truly the most difficult thing. Soldiers not only have to carry firearms, ammunition, and all kinds of necessary supplies on their shoulders, but also have to cut through the walls of trees like digging a tunnel underground, groping forward step by step. This is considered good. Sometimes they have to wade through mud that is knee-deep, and there is no way to deal with it! After the boots and leggings are gone, they have to run barefoot, regardless of whether their feet are bleeding or not. As for falling behind, it is absolutely impossible. No matter whether you can walk or not, you have to grit your teeth and follow the team closely. Who can you complain to about this pain? Aren't your comrades all in the same predicament? At most, they roar loudly a few times to release the pent-up anger and encourage themselves.</p>
<p>Eating Tree Bark and Grass Roots to Satisfy Hunger</p>
<p>Usually, moving like this is considered good. Once, a certain unit moved from a certain place, and there was a shortage of food along the way. The whole unit had to eat tree bark and grass roots to satisfy their hunger. Later, they were so hungry that they felt weak, and the things on their backs seemed to be getting heavier and heavier. Their shoulders seemed to be breaking, and their backs could not be straightened. Forced to, they had to discard the less important things one by one, even expensive cameras. There were no cigarettes either. Someone chopped off dry branches, crushed the dry leaves, and rolled them up with coarse paper to smoke. Because of hunger and malnutrition, many people developed fevers for no reason, and most of them suffered from pain diseases. For example, a certain team said that there were an average of four cases a day. Even more annoying was tropical ulceration, which would not heal no matter how it was treated.</p>
<p>After a long march, when returning to base, the brave warriors could not eat immediately, because life in the jungle had changed their physique. A certain captain once warned his subordinates loudly: "Do not eat for four days, or you will die!" Several soldiers who did not hear the warning and were greedy for food unfortunately lost their lives. How much the captain who knew this danger and warned his subordinates "not to eat" loved his brothers! Everyone who heard this was deeply moved. Some soldiers, although gradually regaining their health and returning to their original state at the base, suffered from constipation because of the tree bark and grass roots they had eaten in the jungle.</p>
<p>Full of Strong Will</p>
<p>The brave warriors who have been tormented in this inhuman jungle life are always full of strong will. "Damn it, look at my skills!" Fire comes out of their eyes, and they jump into the enemy's ranks like lightning. They charge right and left, capture horizontally and chop vertically, like fierce gods. Their bravery is truly astonishing! Such Japanese troops are now scattered throughout New Guinea, and this is something that people in the rear should never forget for a moment.</p>
<p>Rabaul is now completely self-sufficient, and although isolated, it is still fighting powerfully. Enemy air raids continue unchanged. There are as many as two hundred planes at times, and as few as twenty or thirty planes at other times, flying overhead every moment of the twenty-four hours. The brave warriors there have become accustomed to it and are calmly enduring the hardship. They do not easily hide in the air raid shelters until it is extremely dangerous, because through long experience, they can immediately tell whether the bombs will fall or not. As for the night air raids, they know that the enemy's purpose is to launch a psychological war, and the brave warriors are no longer interested in paying attention to it. However, they must guard against parachute bombs and instantaneous bombs, because parachute bombs will explode as soon as they touch the leaves of a coconut tree, and they are blown by the wind, so you don't know where they will explode. As for self-sufficiency, it is not to say that there is enough food. It is very difficult to obtain fresh vegetables in the fields, so the daily work of the brave warriors is to go to the fields to cultivate and build fortifications. They have absolute confidence in the construction of fortifications.</p>
<p>"No matter when they come, we will send them to the west!" Everyone has such confidence. (Special Correspondent Sakagami) (Translated from the Mainichi Shimbun, October 16)</p>
<h3>South Seas Construction</h3>
<p>The restoration and maintenance of public order, the rapid acquisition of important national defense resources, and the establishment of a local autonomous system are the three major goals of the Japanese Southern Army's administration.</p>
<p>The public order in the occupied areas of the South Seas is very good. This is because the Japanese military government guarantees a normal life economically, universally distributes daily necessities, respects good customs and habits culturally, respects the will of the aborigines politically, and treats them gently, and promotes the strength of Japan spiritually, erasing the concept of dependence on Britain, America, and the Netherlands. As a result, the people's hearts are drawn to them. In particular, since Burma and the Philippines have become independent, and in Java, Sumatra, Borneo, Malaya, etc., the aborigines have had systems and opportunities to participate in politics, the aborigines have automatically assisted the Japanese army, or provided labor to participate in the construction of the South Seas, or recruited volunteer soldiers, etc., to jointly defend. As for the overseas Chinese scattered throughout the South Seas, there are 2.5 million in Malaya and 1 million in Java, and about 500,000 in Sumatra. They all have deeply rooted strength in the economy. They are now also assisting the Japanese army, and are participating in the development and industrialization of Southern resources to enhance combat power.</p>
<p>When the Southern Military Government implemented economic policies, it naturally focused on restoring the economic and industrial organizations destroyed by the war, and creating new organizations from the perspective of building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The restoration work has been completed. As for reorganizing a new economy. Because the South Seas were all colonies of enemy countries in the past, and were subject to political oppression and economic exploitation, their industries were only suppliers of raw materials, and were placed in the position of export markets for colonial countries' products. Therefore, they lacked industrial activities and were in a deformed state. In terms of finance, the funds from the export of raw materials were absorbed again by the import of products, and there were organizations that could make certain adjustments in between. However, after breaking away from the colonial countries, the industries had a surplus of raw materials and a shortage of industrial products, and in terms of finance, inflation appeared and the prices of everything rose. These were all expected. Currently, appropriate countermeasures are being sought for the surplus materials such as rubber and tin in Malaya, sugar in Java, and rice in Burma.</p>
<p>As for the industrialization of the local areas, a five-year plan for local self-sufficiency has been formulated, starting in the spring of 1943, including more than a dozen industries. For example, steel plate factories will be built in Malaya, Burma, Sumatra, and Java, electric furnaces will be installed in Malaya, Sumatra, and Java, small charcoal pig iron smelters will be built in Malaya, and open hearth furnaces will be set up in Java and Sumatra. These are the foundations of local industrialization. . In addition, the industrialization of carbide and even the industrialization of iron sand, which was considered absolutely impossible in the era of British rule, is also being realized. As for the production of weaving materials, a large-scale production increase plan has also been established, with the goal of producing tens of thousands of tons of cotton and tens of thousands of tons of hemp. Efforts are also being made to increase food production in order to achieve self-sufficiency.</p>
<p>In order to facilitate the transportation of resources, transportation between Japan and the South Seas must be smooth. Therefore, wooden ships are being actively built in various parts of the South Seas. Malaya, Java, and the Philippines have made great progress in wooden ship construction. Machines used to manufacture wooden ships are also under construction in Malaya and Java. Therefore, maritime transportation will surely make amazing progress in the near future. (Bai Ye)</p>
<h3>The Philippine Islands After Entering the War: The People's Fighting Spirit is High</h3>
<p>Due to the large-scale air raids on the capital Manila by American planes on September 21st and 22nd, the people of the Philippine Islands can no longer tolerate the United States. The brutal bombings and strafings killed and injured many innocent Filipino citizens for no reason, and indiscriminately destroyed hospitals and churches. Previously, due to enemy propaganda, some Filipinos had blindly trusted the United States. However, during the blind bombing of Legazpi on September 22nd, the American planes, which had always claimed that "American planes do not attack Filipinos," strafed citizens walking in the streets with machine guns, killing and injuring them. When this fact spread to Manila, the Filipino people realized the cruelty of the Americans and realized that "the Americans are definitely not trying to recapture the Philippine Islands to save us." Now, the Philippines entered the war on September 23rd, and their fighting spirit is even stronger. On October 17th, Foreign Minister Recto made a radio broadcast, saying, "Will the Philippine Islands become a glorious history, or will they disappear from history as slaves of the United States? It all depends on this battle!" He urged the people to awaken and inspire the people's fighting spirit.</p>
<p>The Filipinos' participation in the war is also evident in their daily lives. Nightclubs and dance halls have been closed since August, and restaurants only serve one soup and one dish. The existing Baojia Protective Corps has been strengthened since September 10th and 11th, organizing fire extinguishing, assisting firefighters, sabotage work, assisting police officers, and emergency rescue teams. They have achieved considerable success in this air raid. Since the implementation of martial law, restaurants have been limited to 7:00 PM or 8:00 PM. This not only prevents the activities of guerrillas, but also eliminates the opportunity for petty thieves to jump out and cause trouble. The safety of the people's lives is further guaranteed, so the citizens do not feel any inconvenience at all, but are grateful. The government has adopted a strong and coercive attitude towards unscrupulous merchants and insane people who hoard food and other supplies during the air raids and the opportunity to participate in the war, ensuring wartime food supplies and giving the citizens a good impression, making their fighting spirit even stronger. In this way, the Filipino people, who have been independent for a year, have transformed their hatred and indignation towards the United States into a fierce fighting spirit, and are working hand in hand with Japan to achieve victory in the Greater East Asia War.

<h3>A Song from the Heart</h3>
<p>— Fang Zheng</p>
<p>I held my high school graduation diploma and returned home with excitement. When my mother saw the diploma, a smile appeared on her face, which was usually unsmiling. She slowly put on her old glasses, untied the red ribbon tied around the diploma, and the clear words on the diploma jumped into her eyes. Although my mother did not know many characters, the words on the diploma seemed to have magic, and she stared at it for a long time. At this time, our whole family—the mother and daughter who depended on each other for life—was completely immersed in an atmosphere of joy. However, a moment of joy brought eternal sadness! My mother restrained the smile on her face and said seriously:</p>
<p>"Zhen! I finally managed to get you through high school. Now you should fulfill my long-cherished wish!"</p>
<p>"Mom! I will never disappoint you. I haven't forgotten what you said." I quickly comforted my mother.</p>
<p>My mother's so-called "long-cherished wish" refers to a profession, because she only has one daughter, and since my father left the world, my mother has endured hardship and relied on her ten fingers—needlework—to cultivate me to finish high school. She originally wanted me to find a job immediately so that she could enjoy a little happiness in life. What's more, in today's rampant inflation, relying solely on my mother's annual income, which is barely enough to make ends meet, cannot fill our stomachs!</p>
<p>—We have no relatives to rely on, and there are only these two paths to take—However, their answers were: "It's very difficult to find a job now. I'll slowly look out for you!" These were clearly perfunctory words. So one month... two months... three... passed, and I still fell into the abyss of unemployment. This terrible "slowly"! My mother sighed from time to time! I also cursed the society for being too ruthless. Although fashionable people shouted slogans of improving women's rights and promoting women's professions all day long, where in society is there room for women to get involved? Where is the way out for us women?</p>
<p>Finally, my destiny was covered with a layer of darkness and began to fall into an irreparable ice cellar! It turned out that I didn't know what means or methods my mother used to get acquainted with Miss X, who had just moved in and worked as a singer at the XX singing hall. Not only were they acquainted, but they were also very "close." As a result, my mother took me to "visit" Miss X one sultry afternoon, which made me very suspicious. But I have always been reluctant to disobey my mother's actions, so I followed her into Miss X's boudoir. I saw that she was only wearing a cicada-winged gauze nightgown, lying obliquely on the sofa smoking. When she saw my mother come, she didn't get up, but just said:</p>
<p>"Teacher X! You really didn't break your promise. If you hadn't come, I would have forgotten! Please sit down, please sit down!"</p>
<p>"What exactly is going on? Why did my mother make an appointment with her, Miss X—in advance, and why did she bring me here?" My thoughts were interrupted by Miss X's sharp voice:</p>
<p>"Is this your Miss Zhen? She's very good-looking! You're really blessed. If she goes to sing, she's sure to become very popular!" My mother also took the opportunity to say to me:</p>
<p>"Zhen! You come to see Miss X. She has found a job for you. You should thank her." I was forced to bow to Miss X and retreated from her boudoir with tears in my eyes. A trap to lure people to fall, my God, my "job"!</p>
<p>That night, I cried and made a fuss. I cannot "fulfill" my mother's "long-cherished wish," let alone sell my songs, especially not lose my personality. My mother coaxed me and shed tears beside me:</p>
<p>"Zhen'er: I love you and don't want you to do such lowly things! But we have no noble relatives or high officials, and a good job will never be available to you. Your mother is getting older and more useless year by year. I can't bear the burden of life anymore! If you can't find a job for a while, are we mother and daughter going to wait to starve to death? I don't have the heart to let you be a prostitute, dancer, hostess, or waitress. It just so happened that I met this Miss X. She said that being a singer is noble and that many female students go to sing. Wasn't there a singing contest held in a certain big restaurant, and weren't they all students who could join? So I asked her to introduce you. Miss X readily agreed and said that singers earn a lot of money! Wouldn't that solve our life problems? Zhen: Please have pity on your mother! Your father died when you were four years old. It was so difficult for me to raise you to be so big. My life's hope is completely pinned on you..."</p>
<p>In the end, we mother and daughter embraced and wailed. Emotion overcame reason, and under the "transformation" of my loving mother, I agreed to my mother's "request" with a policy of slow suicide!</p>
<p>The next night, I put on a newly made cloth cheongsam and applied rouge and powder on my face that I didn't want to. Following Miss X, I stepped into the accounting room of the ×× singing hall. After Miss X introduced me, the young accountant, looking at me obliquely, made me feel ashamed before he blurted out the following order:</p>
<p>"Miss X: Let her try singing for three days, and then decide!"</p>
<p>"Are you still wrong?" Miss X said with a smile to the man, showing a pair of gold teeth that almost made people throw up their dinner.</p>
<p>So, under Miss X's "persuasion," I stood in front of the microphone and sang:</p>
<p>"The birds sing desperately, the flowers bloom willfully, you are so happy..." "Don't forget tonight, don't forget tonight, I give you my whole heart..." That night, I don't know how many songs I sang. Only when everyone was quiet did I drag my exhausted body home.</p>
<p>From then on, I sang "A Song from the Heart" every day, with pain and decadence accompanying me through my miserable years. Although my mother said that being a singer is "noble," I still have to accompany the seat of those patrons who come to cheer and order songs, and deal with their jokes. I am simply a disguised prostitute, dancer, and hostess! At the same time, in order to "become very popular," I have to follow the patrons, or rather, the customers—to dance halls, restaurants, coffee shops...</p>
<p>Now, I am "popular," but sadly, it was exchanged for my innocent body and pure soul. Now I am just a soulless shell.</p>
<p>"...Singers are busy, singers are busy, selling endless lovesickness, sending off endless lovers..." When I sing that song "Singers are Busy," I can't help but shed tears!</p>
<h3>Cricket</h3>
<p>— Jiang Weiqun</p>
<p>Look—</p>
<p>Two pairs of jet-black crickets, claws to claws,</p>
<p>Legs broken,</p>
<p>Teeth dripping with water,</p>
<p>Still struggling reluctantly:</p>
<p>Is it showing off its bravery?</p>
<p>—Or is it flattering its master?</p>
<p>Roar—laughter outside the pot!</p>
<p>I hate it,</p>
<p>I sigh.</p>
<h3>Fortunate Journey</h3>
<p>— Hu Shengquan</p>
<p>…I keep firmly in my heart: Mother's birthday is in a few days, how should we celebrate it? The situation before us is that we really can't afford the cost of a large banquet. Nowadays, "celebrating birthdays" has also been "patented" by some people. Perhaps my mother has already seen this, and she has long warned the family not to mention anything about her "birthday celebration."</p>
<p>…This sentence contains either her wisdom or her sophistication. Maybe she doesn't care about these vulgar customs and wasting a lot of money for her, or maybe she sees through the fickleness of the world. When my father's career was hit, who would be happy to hold her up and treat her as a "birthday mother"? If my guess is unfortunately correct, I really can't imagine how my mother will spend her birthday?</p>
<p>…"It's been more than twenty years," my father often sighed: "Your mother and I have been fighting together, but she hasn't enjoyed a day of happiness!" Now that her fiftieth birthday is approaching, we can't give her a day of glory and happiness. Really, when will she be able to enjoy happiness quietly?</p>
<p>…I remember that my mother's fortieth birthday was spent in our hometown; at that time, my brother had just gotten married, and everyone wanted to take advantage of the joyous occasion to celebrate her birthday. Several relatives and friends who came from Shanghai bitterly persuaded her to "open the door" and make a fuss for a day, but she firmly refused. Her point was that her sons had not yet become independent and adults, and she would wait until her fiftieth birthday to say anything…</p>
<p>…Now her fiftieth birthday is also approaching. Her sons have not only failed to make her proud, but have burdened her with worries; during these ten years, my many illnesses have often kept her up late at night!</p>
<p>…When I was fourteen years old, I actually developed an adult illness, "neurasthenia." When I was fifteen years old, I had a sore under my cheek, so severe that my whole face was swollen and red. My father carried me back from a doctor named Gu after having an operation. The pus and blood from the sore soaked my underwear, but I felt nothing. When I woke up groggily, my mother was lighting incense candles and praying to the gods by my bed.</p>
<p>"Mom, I'll get better soon."</p>
<p>She nodded repeatedly, tears streaming down her face.</p>
<p>…During these years, my many illnesses have made her much thinner. She is a person who cannot be vegetarian, and she often complained to her grandmother: "It's killing me to eat vegetarian food. It's good enough that my conscience is clear." But three years ago, she made a wish and started eating "Nine Emperor Vegetarian Food." I think it was really not easy for her to eat Nine Emperor Vegetarian Food. She used chopsticks to support her rice bowl, unable to swallow the rice. I tried to persuade her to break the vegetarian diet several times, but she ignored me. Finally, I threw a piece of meat into her rice bowl, and she shouted sharply:</p>
<p>"Can you break a vow casually?...Three years, and you will be free from illness and pain." Alas, the great love of a mother!</p>
<p>…During that time, I left her for half a year, and she sent me a letter almost every two or three days. The words were written by my father, and the meaning of the sentences was mostly hers: Be careful of the cold and heat, be careful of your diet, be careful of making friends… The repeated meanings were almost the same.</p>
<p>When I returned unexpectedly, she was so happy that she shed tears. While eating dinner, she went to call for a dish, and sent it to my bowl one chopstick at a time, as if I were a guest, while slowly asking me about the situation on the road.</p>
<p>She loves to give in to us so much, and she has become thinner and older year by year, with new white hairs added to her head; she is using her own life to cultivate us. She is trudging hard on the road of life every day, when can her sons build a more ideal "paradise" for her to support her in her old age?</p>
<p>…Now, she has climbed to the fiftieth milestone of her life with perseverance! Thank God, let her have a wide and smooth road from now on. Are her sons really so unfilial that they have the heart to wait until she is sixty years old and let her say that she will wait until she is seventy years old to celebrate her birthday?…</p>

<h3>The Shên Pao Cup Basketball Group A Competition Enters Its Second Half: Last Week's Battles See Changes; Two Exciting Matches This Week</h3>
<p>The Shên Pao Cup basketball tournament has been underway for over seven weeks. With only two weeks remaining, Group A will conclude, while Group B still has the semi-finals and finals to play. Currently, in Group A, only the Chinese United Industries team (華聯) remains undefeated after the Shantung (汕) team's crushing defeat by the South China team (華南). However, for Chinese United Industries to secure the championship, they must still face three strong opponents: the Shantung team, Dahua (大華), and Zhongbei (中北). Although these three teams have all suffered losses, they are all capable teams, and Chinese United Industries must be cautious in their approach to secure victory. Fortunately, the team has the wise and resourceful guidance of Zhang Wei-xiang (張溎祥), and we can expect them to achieve exceptional results. Here is a review of the key factors in the successes and failures of each Group A match last week.</p>
<p>November 6 (Monday)</p>
<p>Chinese United Industries Wins Against the All-Stars</p>
<p>The outcome of this match hinged entirely on the strength of each team's capabilities. The winner was undoubtedly very normal, and although the loser is a forward-thinking team, it is a notch above in all aspects. Thus, the situation became one-sided, and Chinese United Industries' attacking methods showed further improvement. Moreover, with Zhang Xian-lun (張顯崙) having recovered from his foot injury, the team's morale was even higher. The All-Stars fought bravely while consistently in an unfavorable position, which is commendable.</p>
<p>Tung Jen (同仁) Defeats Team V</p>
<p>The aforementioned two teams have won matches. This match was expected to determine whether a rickshaw puller would be hired. Before the game, it was generally believed that Tung Jen would definitely win. Unexpectedly, Wu Zi-bin (吳子彬) personally supervised Team V. Team V's fast attacks caught Tung Jen off guard. Team V's usual slow pace was quite strong, and it was not easy to gain an advantage. The process was tense throughout, and the final outcome was attributed to Team V's slight lag and panicked appearance. Although Tung Jen won, their performance was not as wonderful as usual, mainly due to their strong desire to win.</p>
<p>November 8 (Wednesday)</p>
<p>Dahua Defeats the China Film Team (華影)</p>
<p>The biggest flaw of the China Film team is that its players cannot arrive on time, but all of them arrived for this match. The team recently had its ideal lineup of players: Ren Ya-wei (任亞偉), Bao Song (包松), Shu Tong-che (舒通車), An Yong-zhan (安永湛), and Gao Mang-sheng (高茫生). Unfortunately, Ren and Bao had been away from the game for too long, and their cooperation was not as smooth. Dahua consistently adopted a man-to-man defense, but eventually declined from strong in the beginning, based on the lack of endurance of one or two players, revealing openings. The China Film team knew how to break the opponent's strategy but failed to execute it, which was the main reason for their defeat. The score difference was very small, indicating that the China Film team could improve further with more practice.</p>
<p>South China Defeats the Shantung Team</p>
<p>The Shantung team was able to overpower Zhongbei and was expected to defeat South China without a doubt. However, the facts showed that the Shantung team lost to South China. Therefore, the predicted outcome has changed. The Shantung team's defeat was due to adhering to outdated methods, which was harmful. Indeed, the team did a good job of defending calmly and successfully in this match, but they failed to adapt to the situation. After falling behind in the score, they should have realized that there was not much time left and urgently changed their strategy, using aggressive man-to-man defense. Moreover, the team's players all had plenty of stamina. Unfortunately, the Shantung team's players did not consider this, and ultimately suffered a crushing defeat. What a pity! South China's victory was due to courage and familiarity. He Jin-gui's (何金貴) daring drive at the end, scoring two consecutive goals, secured the victory and proved him to be a talented player. South China's young players have a spirit of not being discouraged after entering and their future is bright.</p>
<p>November 10 (Friday)</p>
<p>Zhongbei Defeats Jen Yu (仁餘)</p>
<p>Initially, it was thought that it would be a one-sided game, but unexpectedly, Jen Yu showed great spirit individually and as a team. Li He (李) and was most wonderful. Chen Wei-yuan (陳渭源) had the demeanor of a great general. Xia Ze-ren (夏澤人) was as if he was young again. Therefore, Zhongbei struggled under difficult conditions, and the changing of troops and generals took a lot of effort. Until the end, Zhongbei changed from zone defense to man-to-man defense, which allowed them to edge ahead. The difference was still very small, showing Jen Yu's efforts. From this point of view, the team does not necessarily need to recruit famous players. The most important thing is to be willing to learn with an open mind. Looking at Jen Yu's past performance in the Shên Pao Cup, no one would have believed that they could perform so well against Zhongbei.</p>
<p>The Shantung Team Defeats the All-Stars</p>
<p>The Shantung team, learning from their crushing defeat at the hands of South China, and Lin Zuo-shi (林作詩) gained understanding. As a result, the team changed its strategy and implemented man-to-man defense. Although it was not yet perfect, the initial attempt can be considered satisfactory. With key players absent, the All-Stars were unable to gain an advantage. In the end, Fan Xi-rong (范熙榮) was ejected for fouls, and no one could replace him, allowing Lin Wei-cong (林維聰) to enter an undefended territory. Therefore, there is not much to comment on.</p>
<p>Two Good Matches on This Week's Schedule</p>
<p>With the league entering its second half, the games will naturally become more exciting. One is on Wednesday (the 15th), when Chinese United Industries meets the Shantung team. If the latter can win, there is still hope for their future, and the outcome is related to the championship. Furthermore, the team has been working hard, and their ambition has not been crushed by the defeat to South China. The former team stands out from the crowd, maintaining its undefeated record, and is determined not to fail despite having almost completed the journey. This is a battle of dragons and tigers, and the game is sure to be exciting, and the stadium is bound to overflow. The other match is on Friday (the 17th), the battle between Zhongbei and Dahua. Both teams have veteran players who excel in individual techniques. Dahua has the characteristics of Paramount (百樂門). Zhongbei seems to be carrying on the style of Chinese United Industries from before. Years ago, the north-south battle is still fresh in people's minds, so this match can also be the north-south battle of this tournament and is worth watching.</p>

<h3>Essentials of Basketball Theory (4)</h3>
<p>— Liang Zhao-an (梁兆安)</p>
<p>(B) Passing</p>
<p>Passing technique is almost as important as basketball itself. Nothing is more disappointing and undermines a team's authority than poor passing technique. The consequence of inferior passing technique not only affects the team's cooperation and stagnates the offense but also makes the teammates impatient, leading to rougher actions and accumulating fouls, which causes the whole team to be looked down upon and gives the opponent more opportunities to score. Conversely, if a team's passing technique is excellent, it will not only increase the team members' self-confidence and make the offense agile, but also increase the chances of winning, and the audience will also feel good about it.</p>
<p>Although various passing methods can be used in the game, the instructor should first decide which passing method is most suitable for the team's strategy. For example, for the short run away from the ball, a one-handed or two-handed low pass should be used, and for the long run away from the ball, a "hook shot" or softball-style pass should be used.</p>
<p>There are many different ways to practice passing, but the most important thing is to make the trainees interested. The practice time should not be too long. Players will not feel bored practicing shooting for an hour, but they will feel bored even practicing passing for fifteen minutes. In short, no matter what kind of practice method is adopted, players should be trained to develop the habit of running forward to receive the ball, and players should never be allowed to stand still and wait for the ball to be passed.</p>
<p>There are many types of basic passing methods. Here are some commonly used methods, such as hook shot pass, softball-style pass, two-handed low pass, alternating hand chest pass, and one-handed low pass.</p>
<p>(1) Hook Shot Pass</p>
<p>This passing method is very important. Once mastered, the pass will be very accurate, but very few players in Shanghai use it. This passing method is to pass the ball over the opponent's head so that the team member behind the opponent can receive it. It is most suitable to use when leaving the opponent's defender. When passing the ball, the left foot should take a step forward first, and then the right foot should be raised and circled to the left. At the same time, the body should jump up and turn to the left. When the feet jump up into the air, the right hand should hold the ball, stretch it straight up and circle it. When it is higher than the shoulder and head, pass the ball. When passing the ball, the elbow should be slightly bent, and the wrist and finger pressure should be used to throw the ball down, so that the ball is easy to catch. When the body lands, it should stand in the direction of the ball pass. If the left hand is used to pass the ball, the direction should be reversed.</p>
<p>(2) Softball-Style Pass</p>
<p>This passing method is completely the same as the posture of throwing a softball. It is suitable for long-distance running, passing to a teammate who is shooting forward horizontally, especially when there are no enemies between the receiver and the basket. However, this passing method must be fast and accurate, and it must be done with a certain degree of certainty, so it is not easy to be effective without practice.</p>
<p>(3) Low Hand Pass</p>
<p>Because this method is simple and easy to implement, it is the most widely used by teams. In addition, because the ball-holding posture of this passing method and the ball-holding posture of the receiving ball do not need to be changed, it is easy to shoot, pass, create confusion to drive away enemies, or disrupt the opponent's defense line. Its many advantages really outweigh other passing methods.</p>
<p>The correct ball-holding method for this passing method is to use both hands to carefully open the fingers and hold both sides of the ball, but not too tightly, because too tight will not be flexible, and not too loose, because too loose will easily fall off. The two hands must be used with even and gentle force. When holding the ball, it should always be placed between the abdomen, and the body should be slightly bent forward to protect the ball from being snatched by the opponent. When passing the ball, it should be passed from the side, with one hand moved to the back of the body and the other hand placed in front of the body to hold and pass the ball.</p>
<p>(4) Two-Handed Chest Pass</p>
<p>Most Shanghai team members are used to using this method. This passing method uses the wrists and fingers of both hands to push the ball out in the chest. The rest of the ball-holding posture is exactly the same as the two-handed low pass method. However, its advantage is even better than the two-handed pass method, because it is more flexible and faster when passing the ball.</p>
