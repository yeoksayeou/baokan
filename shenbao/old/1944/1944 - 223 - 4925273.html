<p>社評</p>
<h3>鄉村建設之機構</h3>
<p>自上月二十六日國防會議通過鄉村建設計劃大綱以來，似乎各方面均在積極推進之中。鄉村之重要，猶屋之於基，樹之於根，非先健全鄉村無以言其他建設。國府遷都迄今，對內收拾殘局，對外應付國際，雖未追及此，亦無可厚非。際此決戰在即千鈞一發之秋，決定此項要案，足徵政府於一日萬幾之中，始終未忘懷於基本工作之概要。惟其期望殷切，遂不禁提供肺腑之言，以供當局參考。故本報七月二十九日社評中曾以此立論，而着眼於如何先求消滅破壞鄉村之種種因素。今國府已根據國防會議前議決設立鄉村建設實施委員會明令公佈組織條例，爰再就行政機構方面，加以剖析，籍貢　蕘。</p>
<p>按計劃大綱內所載之第三甲，應於行政院設鄉村建設「策進」委員會，而七日所公布者爲鄉村建設「實施」委員會之組織條例，且其第一條中明文規定直隸行政院，蓋前者爲假定名稱而後者爲決定名稱，似無疑義。</p>
<p>若此二者僅爲名稱2上之差別，則其組織上之原則必以計劃大綱之規定爲依歸。按計劃大綱爲副委員長，並由內政、財政、教育、實業、宣傳、建設、社會福利各部部長，及衛生局長，各省長，特別市長，行政院秘書長，全國經濟委員會秘書長，新國民運動促進委員會秘書長，合作事業委員會委員長爲委員，而組織條例中既未列副委員長，且僅規定委員七人至九人，似以常務委員三人代副委員長，然則委員人數寥寥，不敷支配，大綱條例何去何從。或以計劃大綱之規定範圍過廣，除軍事外交未列入外，其規模之龐大將包　行政院之各部門，甚且搬而充之，因此而加以修正緊縮。然同爲國防會議通過之議定案，事隔旬日而前後兩歧，恐亦非所宜。</p>
<p>倘「策進」與「實施」確乎爲並立之機構，則行政院之驟增比二大組織，雖鄉村建設爲極重要之基本工作，究否有此似尚須加以考慮。且按條例內第六條及第七條中所規定該委員會第一處及第二處掌理之事項，加以歸納，亦無非內政、教育、實業、建設以及社會福利諸事主管職務之一部分，已無增設委員會之需要，倘「策進」與「實施」再分別成立，豈非　床架屋，而更使行政之系統紊亂。鄉村建設固爲局部問題，或非中樞各部最高長官所能躬親，因而設立特殊機構專司其事，以期深入民間，然無論「策時」與「實施」皆有明文規定直隸行政院，則其地位正與各部相當，而各委員之資格在「實施」方面均爲簡任以上之大員，而「策進」方面按大綱中之規定則盡由各部長秘書長委員長充任，又將何以自圓其說。</p>
<p>爲政貴求效率，而效率受機構之影響者甚大。鄉村固爲國家社會之基石，其榮枯消長足以左右國運，然鄉村建設究屬國政中政黨事業之一部分，即由政黨組織負其全責，亦非苛求。縱令事態急迫工作緊張，何妨就各部有關之司中指定一二科長專辦鄉村事宜，擬具較切實際之原則，經行政院核准後，分發各省政府及特別市政府並資成其各就特殊情形加以補充，然後通令各縣政府分期施行，而付以適應環境在不背大原則之條件下得有變通之特權，惟須按時責效，藉以判縣長之成績，如此既直接了當而事半功倍。否則委員諸公每人已智週萬物央兼三五要職，若再加之鄉村工作，頻添若幹會議，即使不願敷衍了事，精力亦有所不及。實際之工作不施以實際之方法，而冀其能奏　功，殆猶緣木而求魚。況中國人材向感缺乏，高談闊論者多，埋頭苦幹者少，今按「實施」委員會之組織，簡任以上之大員姑道勿論，而應任之科長科員以及附設之「設計」委員會之委員總計約四十人，若再益以尚待成立之「策進」委員會之　任人員，則當有百人左右。此四十人乃至百人必皆年富力強精明強幹之公務員，且對於鄉村建設有興趣而有研究者，否則不能用途愉快，而所設之計，又必隔靴搔癢無補進艱。何不將此項人材直接指派鄉村工作，就地發揮其能力，而使消磨於紙上談兵之生活，豈不可惜？</p>
<p>今有人爲，內瘵外癱，形消骨立，氣息奄奄，朝不保夕，爲其父母者，乃爲之修建廟宇，彫塑神像，意在求神仙　騐之方，其心可憫乃其愚不可及，蓋仙方未得而　之木拱矣，況仙方未可必得也。良醫良相，其理相通，處今之世尤其治理今日之中國，須慎防其虛脫，宜採急救之方法，以保留其元氣，萬不可再紆迴延宕以搪塞門面爲能事，鄉村建設如此，其他建設亦莫不皆然！</p>
<h3>天津義大利租界　定今日交還我國　諸外長廣播演講接收意義</h3>
<p>天津十三日中央社電　關於天津義大利租界交還事宜，業於上月十四日在南京國府　　樓，由國府外交部長褚民誼，義大利駐華臨時代辦施畢納利，代表兩國政府簽訂協定，並定於八月十四日正式在津辦理交接手續。茲悉義代辦施畢納利，及國府外交部歐美司長及亞洲司長范徐兩氏，業於日前自首都來華，主持交接事宜。</p>
<p>南京十三日中央社電　十四日我政府正式收回天津義大利租界，禇外交部長於十二日以「爲接收天津義租界敬告國人」爲題民，向全國廣播演講，茲錄大意如下：</p>
<p>諸位同胞，八月十四日是正式收回天津義大利租界的日子，天津的義國縣辦，本應爲交還，祇因義前政府，有種種的企圖和條件處的主張，所以未能和其他租界同時交還。到了今年，義國本身既然漸次安定，這一問題，自然也不能再緩。又承盟邦日本熱心從事，繞能急轉直下，得告成功。七月十四日時簽署了協定，同時，並約定八月十四日晨天津簽署協定的細目。</p>
<p>在各國租界交還後，天津義租界拖延的其間，有好多人都懷疑這件事，以爲爲甚麽天津義國租界仍然不還？本人敬告國人，天津義租界所以延遲到今天　得解決的緣故，在義國方面，自然有他遲遲交還的理由。在我們自己呢，卻是時時刻刻的在期待，嚴嚴密密的在注視，精精細細的在找尋機會，堅堅絕絕的在准備動作，雖沒有一點顯露，也沒有一步放鬆，事實的存在，已然解答了國人的懷疑。本人於此，自無庸多所論列了。</p>
<p>繼續抵禦外人侵略</p>
<p>天津租界是外人在在華租界的最後一個，天津義國租界的交還，也就外人在華租界最後一個的交還。從此以後，中國的腹心之憂，已完全除去了，中國的滅亡大患，已不複存在了。本人不恭不兩點感想：一點，收回租界的運動，至今已然經過好幾十年，爲這事，不知犧牲了多少生命和録錢，始終未能辦到。國父比重不忘此事，並且留到了遺囑，這是多麽不容易的事。可　現在居然接收到最後一個了。還有一點，租界的存在，的確是中國的腹心的憂，因爲租界成立的主因，就是外人摧毀我國的根據地，經濟的侵略，文化的侵略，都是得勝租界的便利，從而摧之我們的收回租界，直接是減輕侵略的壓迫，間接就是自救滅亡。但是租界雖然收回，外人侵略壓迫究竟能不能減輕，滅亡的挽救，究竟能不能生效。所以，租界雖然收回，吾人抵禦外人侵略的工作並未終了，吾人挽救希望的目的，亦未完成。吾人尚有無形的租界，應當繼續收回，吾人尚有更大於收回租界的工作，應當繼續。</p>
<p>各種長處設法保存</p>
<p>現在租界戲被我們收回，我們千萬不要以爲工作已然終了，希望已然滿足。我們須認識租界的生命，瞭解租界的靈魂，給他在生命上，加添一　新靈魂，給他在靈魂上，誕生一副新驅殼，他的效果和力量，在我們爲有害的，我們應當如何去解除他，在他們如有利的，我們應當如何去繼承他，這　不負收回租界的成功。不然的話，表面的租界雖然收回，實際上的租界仍然存在，那麽，租界雖然收回，也就和不收回無甚麽差別了。</p>
<p>進一步說，租界雖然　，也有他的長處。例如清潔整齊，完美舒適等。但也有他的短處，例如淫濫奢侈，匪棍盤踞，社會黑幕重重，生活墮落危險等。長處應當設法保存，短處應當驅逐改善，這是我國全體同胞應積極負起的責任。</p>
<p>敬向盟邦鄭重遵謝</p>
<p>此外，這次各國租界的收回，是盟邦日本　倡交還賓。在去年三月，自動的把各地所有的租界，毫無保留的全都交還這，把日本在華所享的治外法構，完全撤廢，也多出於盟邦的協調的。至於此次義大利在津租界的交還，也完全出於盟邦政府的協助，所以中國得除此百年心腹之患，不能不說是全由盟邦日本所玉成。所以本人在此最後收回天津義租界的前夕，鄭重的向盟邦日本敬早謝意。</p>
<p>太平洋方面</p>
<p>日軍綜合戰況</p>
<p>東京十二日中央社電　　南太平洋方面，本週內軍對拉巴爾之空襲仍極頻繁，惟來襲機數似略見減少，但其對愛爾蘭島加比恩之空襲次數，則似較增加。同時堪恩達納奧方面最近亦有敵機出現，八月十一日上午敵大型機，九架曾來襲蘇門答臘某地區。㈠中部太平洋方面，七月三十一日迭尼安方面敵軍，首以機械化部隊爲先導，突入日軍最後陣地以來，該方面戰線已呈混亂狀態，茲日軍部隊刻在各處攻擊敵軍。又在大宮島方面日軍在明石街北方收縮並整理戰線後，更在東北方山陵地帶附近，刻正重創敵軍，但自八日敵戰車部隊在各處分別安全感日軍陣地，茲譔　方面之激鬥，正在不分晝夜返進行中。十日夜敵艦對該兩島日軍陣地，曾作猛烈襲擊，並投下照明彈，現該兩島日軍正待充分發揮日本之傳統精神。七月廿五，廿六、廿七三日暗，敵軍曾以艦上飛機計有數百架來襲宿　及巴拉奧等地，其後於八月四日，五日以巡洋艦驅逐艦砲碢父島，但經當地日軍奮起邀擊後，當即擊落四十一架，並將來犯之巡洋艦擊退。</p>
<p>西南太平洋日軍某十三日中央社電　敵機之來襲西南太平洋方面日趨激化，九日晨有敵戰鬥機約五十架來襲　蘭島之普拉，日軍擊毀其大型機一架。又十一日晨有轟炸機約二十架來襲新幾內亞西北之加馬那。</p>
<p>北緬日軍奮戰經過</p>
<p>北緬前線十三日中央社電　北緬要衝密芝那，曆經四月之血戰，戰況極爲激烈，南北　流密芝那之佷洛瓦底，河水成深赤色。渝英美聯軍一萬餘衆，與日軍精銳死鬥，日軍以寡制衆，戰至最後一兵，至七月底達四閱月一久，敵方棄死俘虜投降負傷兵員共計一萬五千餘，至八月二三兩日裏戰到底之日軍勇士率命撤出密芝那，將陣地他移，凖備次期作戰。</p>
<p>日翼政會</p>
<p>刷新陣容</p>
<p>東京十三日中央社電　日翼政會新總裁小林　遣之推戰式，業於本月十一日隆重舉行，新總裁以老練之政治經驗統率其會員，各方莫不寄與極大好感。至於會內政務之整理，尤爲各方所期待，今後對於㈠　整備對新政府之關係，㈡強化刷新該會運營及指導方針，㈢改革新國民組織，㈣刷新人事組織各案之解決，藉機會將確立順應戰時態勢，會內切望吸收和材刷新陣容，幹事長制之採用等亦在考慮中。</p>

<p>西貢十三日中央社電　日駐越芳澤大使，九日偕渡邊情報部長行抵茶咖，旋於十一日訪德古德督，就越南關係及世界情勢交換意見，聞該大使定於十四日返此。</p>
<p>日積極調整煤業增産</p>
<p>東京十三日中央社電　煤乃軍需生産基本原料，日本自本年四月至七月間之生産狀況，産量與去年同時期相較，突破量極微，與龐大之本年度生産計劃相較，相差甚巨，故樹立煤增産之根本對策與急速實施，已成當前急務，尤其在石煤産量之勞力問題，亟待根本解決，其主要各點如次：㈠「軍動員與産業動員之調整」煤礦工人被召入伍者，大部分爲熟練工人，其生産能力可抵未熟練者數人，煤戲爲戰略之基礎，軍動員與産業動員必須根本加以調整。㈠「一般徵用的實施」關於煤礦工員之徵用雖已實施，最近昜實施對有經驗者之指名徵用，便以現今煤礦工員量及　之不足觀之，終未能達到所期目的，故必須實施一般徵用。</p>
<h3>日空軍奇襲　西安漢中機場　炸毀飛機及軍事設施</h3>
<p>中國前線基地十三日中央社電　日軍航空部隊轟炸機隊，於十一日深夜曾奇襲西北渝美空軍基地西安漢中飛機場，予以甚大損害。此天氣惡劣，日軍於西安飛行場擊毀大型機二架，焚毀大型機七架，炸毀火藥庫兩處外，有一處爆炸，三處起火。於漢中飛行場焚毀小型機二架，十一處起火，日轟炸機隊全部安然返防。</p>
<p>重慶廣播衡陽失陷</p>
<p>廣州十三日中央社電，重慶廣播，重慶當局已承認第九戰區牙城衡陽業經陷落，並認日軍今後必仍繼續南進。其大意謂日軍自八月四日對衡陽進行猛攻以來，七日即衝入市內中央部，是時防衛軍司令官第十軍軍長方先覺，曾電請示軍事當局，至八日遂失陷。日軍雖不立即前進，然今後或更行南進，期打通奧漢線，或向東南方進攻美空軍各基地。</p>
<h3>華北開發局　增高建設班</h3>
<p>北京十三日中央社電　華北開發計劃局，前因設　警勞本部，而縮減一課二班，今爲擴充機構起見，又增設建設班。按此乃審查開發關係事業之土木建築，及其他各建設事業，及幹旋所要資材者。最近各關係事業，成傾力謀重要事業之開發，故今後該建設班工作進展，頗堪期待。</p>
<h3>米統會將在京　成立分會</h3>
<p>南京十三日中央社電　商統會米糧統制委員會，爲強化南京地區之米糧收購配給等事宜，鑒於以往駐京辦事處之活動成績，未能臻於圓滑推動地步，故決定將於該處撤銷，另組織一米統會南京分會。此舉將於本月二十日左右實現，並開將在該分會內，設立一指導委員會，聘請各關係機關長官爲委員，委員長一席將由南京聯絡部長當田大佐兼任。一般市民於該分會成立，　未來工作之推展，咸期待甚股。</p>
<h3>衛生署在各地　辦理禁煙</h3>
<p>南京十三日中央社電　內政部辦理煙民登記後，爲肅清煙毒起見，於本年夏間委託衛生署，開辦各省市戒煙醫院，夭資救濟。該署即於南京及上海兩地設立戒煙醫院，月內即可成立，實行戒煙。至於院長人選，已由衛生署聘請該署醫政處某處長闡明，兼任中央戒煙醫院院長，管綏獲任國立上海戒煙醫院院長。至蘇浙皖三省，七十二縣戒煙整備，由衛生署指定各省縣公私立規模較大之醫院兼理，並由中央給予補助費，以資普遍戒毒，而竟全功。聞指定辦理戒煙整備之醫院，計甲級六處，業經計劃就緒，並定於本月三十日，先行如今甲級兼理戒煙醫院各院長，及負責人，到京會談，討論進行辦法。尚有乙丙兩級之兼理戒煙醫院負責人，亦將於下月繼續召集，此乃內政部與衛生署努力戒絕煙毒之先聲也。</p>

<h3>侵歐軍變更戰略　諾曼第將展開　空前大決戰　　美軍主力沿塞特河北進</h3>
<p>柏林十三日中央社電　德軍當局十二日對記者團宣稱：北法之反軸心之强化，恐爲兩軍展開空前決戰之前奏，反軸心軍本企圖沿蒙城至洛爾河兩岸，自南方席捲德軍陣地，此點即爲現進戰局之特徵。美軍將自蒙城更指向克恩市之德軍陣地北上，同時自克恩東南進向巴黎，與於布列塔尼作戰之美軍結爲一體，但該反軸心之作戰計劃，至現今僅成功一關，即僅完成布列塔尼之侵攻作戰。故反軸心軍司令部已不得不放棄以往企業，重新自諾曼第戰線北上，以期使該方之德軍陷於孤立。鑒於以上轉動，恐兩軍空前絕後之大海戰勢必將展開。</p>
<p>柏林十三日中央社電　海通社訊：反軸心軍之補充，由美軍於渡洛爾河下游後，聲稱欲進攻波爾多可證明之。該河南面之敵軍，顯爲偵察活動，或爲保護美第三軍之右翼，美軍大部已向薩特河之東北及北歐推進，其目的顯爲直部諾曼第德軍前線之後方，即先佔領阿祖貢（Alencon)現兩軍之坦克軍隊正在劇戰中。英第二軍於左翼之蒙城.盧昂.與格裏姆巴斯克森林間，已前進若幹，此乃響應加拿大軍攻擊法萊斯而行者。</p>
<p>被圍德軍堅拒投降</p>
<p>裏斯本十三日中央社電　據昨夜前線消息：反軸心曾二度向守備勃萊斯特港（Brest)之德軍臻最後通牒，勸告降伏，然遭拒絕，按勃萊斯特港之德軍，自五日被美軍包圍以來，即奮勇作戰，死守該港，以迄於今，刻仍繼續苦戰中。</p>
<h3>維斯都拉河套　戰局仍嚴重　　蘇軍流河未逞</h3>
<p>柏林十三日中央社電　海通社訊：東線北路戰事重心係在庇斯柯夫湖之南及拉脫維亞全區，蘇軍進攻已二日，以步兵十師及坦克車三團企圖突破德軍撤退防線，使其計不得逞，突破之點已在新防線被阻。德軍在東普魯士東部及東南，獲得防守上之勝利，蘇軍在該處設有最新式之坦克車隊，由於維爾科離希根及需要寗兩城尚在德軍手中，證明蘇軍攻勢之。華沙前線蘇軍再行進攻，但德軍生力軍已阻止蘇軍之前進，維斯杜拉河套局勢依然嚴重，蘇軍目的顯爲渡河，現德軍已在巴拉諾夫橋頭之南北陣地阻其前進，但南部陣地已退後三公里，其目的爲免臻德軍被包圍。</p>
<h3>盛傳羅邱　將再度會晤</h3>
<p>瑞典京城十二日中央社電　海通社訊：「哥德堡商航報」截華盛頓息，謠傳羅斯福總統與邱吉爾首相將再度會晤，會晤之地點或在義大利與太平洋間中途之某地，因邱吉爾現在　國，而羅斯福則正在訪問太平洋美軍基地。有談及印度爲可能之會晤地點，會晤時將討論蒙特巴頓海軍上將轄境內加緊作戰之問題。</p>
<h3>羅斯福會視察阿留申島防務</h3>
<p>裏斯本十三日中央社電　海通社訊：合衆社華勱頓息，羅斯福總統曾於上星期偕　北太平洋美軍司令，乘艦　在阿留申羣島之某島登陸，視察軍種設備，總統於視察後會謂，戰事結束以後，阿留申島亦有保留適當根據地之絕對必要。</p>
<h3>華盛頓會議定下週舉行</h3>

<h3>斯洛伐克　全國戒嚴</h3>
<p>布拉的斯拉伐十三日中央社電　海通社訊：斯洛伐克政府頒布全國戒嚴令，今後不法分子之陰謀叛國者，搶刦害人者及怠工者概處死刑。</p>
<h3>土燈火管制　擴大範圍　　斯丹埠實施宵禁</h3>
<p>里斯本十三日中央社電　海通社訊：土耳其擴大燈火管制範圍，全國實行管制者已有三十一省，迄至目前爲止，實行燈火管制者僅安加拉.斯丹埠.伊斯米省。斯　丹埠已實行宵禁，時間自夜十一時至次晨日出爲止。</p>
<h3>紐約對岸　船塢大火　　損失四百萬美金</h3>
<p>里斯本十三日中央社電　據紐約電：紐約港對岸之　巴金（Hoboken)船塢，十二日由一船爆炸，發生大火，堆積於碼頭上凖備向前線運輸之軍需品盡付一炬，估計損失達四百萬美元，其起火原因現正調查中。</p>

<p>娛樂塲所　調整時間</p>
<p>市府當局為節制電力，將電燈點用時間規定暫行辦法，予以限制後，警察當局即遵照嚴格執行在案，市民亦均確切遵照辦理實施，即各娛樂塲所之營業時問，亦經各該業自行調整。各影戲院劇塲已提早夜塲開映，開　時間，計影院末塲八時映，據塲舞臺夜塲六時半開演，跳舞塲咖啡館以及其他飲食店等亦已於前（十二）日起於下午十時打烊，各旅館公寓之電燈一律於十一時關熄，惟於前（十二日）晚實施節制電力辦法，記者特巡視各區，遵守辦理者尚佔大數。但違犯‘規則者亦有人在，詢諸當局據談當依照市府明令予以嚴厲警告，如再故犯，須停止其電流供給，或竟吊銷其營業執照云。</p>

<h3>美國黑人問題　益趨惡化</h3>
<p>— 日大使館情報部長松平忠久</p>
<p>據外國電報稱：木月二日美國費城因美人壓迫黑人過甚，致公共汽車地下鐵道等市內交通，黑人職工業起而罷工，繼又發生暴動，美當局對此終於開動軍隊，加以彈壓，因而負傷者計有十三人之多，另一部份黑人靑年職工，手持手槍小刀棒及瓦片等，作為武器，侵入市街，因而被當局逮捕者計有三百餘人，而該市之交通，亦由軍隊維特，至此，所謂黑色人種問題，亦益趨惡化。</p>
<p>查去年夏在數星期中，美國內十二市發生黑人暴動事件，其問因而死者六人，傷者六十餘人，該次爭鬥最烈者，首推臺得路特市。考其原因實由於自戰爭發生後，約有黑人數十萬人，移往該地，而當地白種人職工，屢因所謂人種之反感，而與黑人勞工發生摩感，加之KKK等團體對黑人施以有組織性之壓迫，謀阻止戰後黑人居住於該地，因而使黑人陷於無屋可居之困難狀態中，故黑人以此為動機而發生爭鬥暴動。</p>
<p>考美國方面之黑人間題，實始於其開國之初，即當時由非洲移來多數黑人奴隸之時，其後美國復因黑人之處理問題，而惹起南北戰爭，故黑人問題不　為美國煩惱之根源。筆者茲回憶當初駐美服務時美國之黑人問題而略述觀感於後：</p>
<p>黑人在社會生活上之不平等</p>
<p>自林背解放奴隸後，雖在法律上已禁止對黑人作為奴款之用，然現在黑人仍受極不平等之待遇，此實為無可韓言之事實，在美國西部及北部方面黑人較少，故其所受之待遇雖屬不平等，而亦難趨　著，反之，美國南部黑人較多，故其反動頗為　著。筆者初到美華盛頓時，最先使余感驚奇者，即黑人所乘之電梯與白人所乘者有別，搬行李之黑人侍役，除有必要須與客人同行時，始能乘白人用之電梯，此外如在其職務上必要以外者，則必須乘黑人專乘用之電梯。筆者曾囑大使館之侍役，搬行李入某公寓時，忽不見該侍役，其後見其乘另一電梯上樓，當時余曾訽以「為何不與余同乘一電梯？彼答：「吾等黑人，不能與閣下同乘體電梯。」彼又向余說明，彼等在社會上地位低劣之一般情形。又余初到美國時，余之友人曾告余於乘公共汽車，切勿坐於該車之後部，若乘於後部，將蔽誤認為黑人，而有被欺之　，其後當余乘車時，果見前後部有黑白之分。</p>
<p>若吾人往美國南部時，此種情形更為顯著，此實吾人極不愉快者。在公共厠所時，有白種人用及黑人用之分，電影院飯菜館及其他各公共集會所，時可見懸有一牌，上雷「祗准白人入內」。筆者在伊斯卡洛萊納一小都市時，會與一日本學友同往公園時，始目睹一黑人正在受極度之私刑，此種行為，實難以筆墨形容。總之，是野鐵，非人道。常時實使余對此種行為，竟能加之於人類之身，而表示疑問。彼時如將該種情形詳加說明，將遭受檢查時被禁，筆者見此極刑後，內心欲嘔，而往附近之飲水處漱口時，見懸有一牌上書黑人用，斯種情形，余尚記憶甚淸，即以上數則，即可知其一斑。</p>
<p>黑人在職業上之不平等</p>
<p>此處所述者即其地位較奴隷稍進化，然其聯業大都為勞工，且為最下級之勞工，故彼等均呻吟於最下級之生活水準中。</p>
<p>最近黑人之教育程度，較前為進步，受大學教育者亦不在少數，然其出賂則被限制，極難獲得在社會上稍有地位之職業。黑人律師處決無白人前往請教，而黑人醫師更無白種病人，而學者亦不能進白人所經管之學校任教授，即取得美籍之中日兩國國民，在美國亦大致遭受以上情形，而最感煩惱者為黑人在職業上之不平等，更為顎著。</p>
<p>筆者攻讀於密西根大學時，曾有黑人同學，彼所讀者為法律采，時見教授有蔑視彼之態度，而彼往往取反抗之能度，以難題質問教授，使露　能。余曾訽其「畢業後將如何？」彼謂：「畢業後將供職於黑人所經營之學校，此外別無就職之道。」彼又見黑人政治家中在衆院任議員者，僅一人，而表示憤慨，密西根大學中有一經濟學教授，名為雷麥，為「列國在巾國之貿易」之著作者，彼曾在上海住三年之久，似曾在聖約紛大學執教，彼對中國特「以親切之態度對付傭人一之態度，然彼對黑人則「以冷酷嫌惡之態度對付斗人」之能一度而對付之，彼謂「余可以東亞人為金之助手，然余對黑人不論其頭腦何等聰明，決不以彼爲余之助手。」</p>
<p>黑人中在美國聞名者有著名之拳國家「路易斯，」及短跑世界選手之「歐文」等，然美國白人對黑人之成為世界名手並不表欣幸，並謂其技術為從白人處習得，故並不希奇，且不諭黑人如何能發揮其天才，萬不能因而指導白人，由於以上種種而觀，可了見其在職業上之不平等。</p>
<p>最近黑人問題惡化之原因</p>
<p>美國對其國內構：此次戰爭，為被壓洎者之解放戰，黑人指導者對此指稱：「美國內尚且有黑白兩人種之分，故對此次戰爭稱為被壓迫者之解放戰爭殊多矛盾」，並高呼「戰後應解放黑人被壓迫之狀態」，及「討論戰後問題時，應一舉使黑人獲得平等及發言權」等，而一般黑人，亦與之呼應，黑人更在服兵役時，強硬要求，不得有黑白之左別。其要求大致如次：一工廠內之平等，二軍隊中之平等，三法律上及市民權利之平等。關於第一點，因美國正處於人力不足之際，故採用黑人之比率較高，因此此點大致已見改善，然軍需工廠中，黑人僅能獲半熟練工以下之職，其人數不下百餘人，至第二及第三兩點，根本未被美國人所攷慮，故黑人極表不滿，此為黑人問題惡化之主要原因之一。又黑人之向工業界方面挺進，為數甚少，尤以造船飛機及電機製造廠等，以往黑人素不能進之工廠，在現在多採用黑人，而白人勞至戰後，故對黑人多抱惡感，此為造成此次黑人問題惡化原因之二。加之由於目下重要產業大都市之人口過取，及生活設備之不完全，致現實生活趨於惡化，黑白兩種人種之心境，均類不安，其方針亦不一致，隨之此問題，亦難獲解決。</p>
<p>一般黑人之態度</p>
<p>司法當局對此問題之態度，故意不追求其根源之何在，而聯邦政府雖詳知本問題之重要性，然恐戰時巾，國內頻發此種爭　，故極力壓制黑人。又議會中南部之議員，及一部份保守黨議員，絕對反對改善黑人之地位，因此實業界亦對黑人雇工不加攷盧，而白人之工會，又往往排斥黑人勞工，至一般對黑人之心理，一如以上所述，含有反動性，其中對本問題具有同情心者，唯少數而已。例如著作家「麥克威廉姆」主張人　公正，提倡聯邦政府應解決本問題。又戰時生產當局黑人雇傭訓練部「魏巴開」氏謂：改善工業界及軍隊中黑白人之待遇，爲當務之急，且戰後亦不應有左別，予以一定之保障。</p>
<p>總之：經此次戰爭後，黑人方面已有猛醒，而白人方面雖有所知，然對黑人之反感益昂，而一般雖對此問題之重要性，略有所知，亦未加以　慮，而識者亦爲慮及本問題之根本所在，另一方面，當局之態度，僅每遇事件發生後，採取彈壓手段，而未對木問題之根木加以解決，故預料黑人問超，必益趨惡化及擴大。</p>

<h3>Organizations for Village Construction</h3>
<p>Since the National Defense Conference passed the General Outline of Village Construction Plan on the 26th of last month, it seems that all parties are actively promoting it. The importance of villages is like the foundation of a house and the roots of a tree. Without first strengthening the villages, there is no way to talk about other constructions. Since the National Government moved its capital, it has been dealing with the aftermath of internal conflicts and coping with international affairs, so it is excusable that it has not been able to catch up with this. At this critical moment of impending decisive battle, the decision on this important matter demonstrates that the government has never forgotten the general outline of basic work despite its myriad responsibilities. However, due to its earnest expectations, I cannot help but offer heartfelt advice for the authorities to consider. Therefore, this newspaper's editorial on July 29th took this as its starting point, focusing on how to first eliminate the various factors that destroy villages. Now that the National Government has, based on the prior resolution of the National Defense Conference, established the Village Construction Implementation Committee and officially announced the organizational regulations, I will further analyze the administrative organization, hoping to contribute a small amount.</p>
<p>According to item three, section one, of the General Outline of the Plan, a Village Construction "Promotion" Committee should be established under the Executive Yuan. However, what was announced on the 7th was the organizational regulations of the Village Construction "Implementation" Committee, and Article 1 explicitly stipulates that it is directly under the Executive Yuan. It seems that the former is a tentative name, while the latter is the decided name, which seems to be beyond doubt.</p>
<p>If the only difference between the two is in the name, then the organizational principles must follow the regulations of the General Outline of the Plan. According to the General Outline of the Plan, the committee should have a vice-chairman and be composed of the ministers of the Ministries of Interior, Finance, Education, Industry, Propaganda, Construction, and Social Welfare, as well as the Director of the Health Bureau, the Governors of the provinces, the Mayors of special municipalities, the Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, the Secretary-General of the National Economic Council, the Secretary-General of the New Life Movement Promotion Committee, and the Chairman of the Cooperative Enterprise Committee. However, the organizational regulations not only do not list a vice-chairman but also stipulate that there should only be seven to nine members. It seems that three standing committee members are to replace the vice-chairman. However, the number of members is too small to manage effectively. What is to become of the General Outline and the regulations? Perhaps the scope of the General Outline is too broad, and except for military and diplomatic affairs, its scale is so large that it encompasses all departments of the Executive Yuan, even replacing them entirely, and therefore, it has been revised and compressed. However, since both are resolutions passed by the National Defense Conference, it is probably inappropriate for them to be contradictory only ten days apart.</p>
<p>If the "Promotion" and "Implementation" committees are indeed separate organizations, then the Executive Yuan would suddenly have two major organizations. Although village construction is an extremely important basic task, it is still necessary to consider whether it is appropriate to have such a setup. Furthermore, according to the matters stipulated in Articles 6 and 7 of the regulations regarding the responsibilities of the first and second sections of the committee, when summarized, they are nothing more than a portion of the duties under the jurisdiction of the Ministries of Interior, Education, Industry, Construction, and Social Welfare. There is no need to establish another committee. If the "Promotion" and "Implementation" committees are established separately, would it not be redundant and further disrupt the administrative system? Village construction is indeed a local issue, and perhaps the highest officials of the central ministries cannot personally handle it. Therefore, a special organization is established to specialize in this matter in order to deeply penetrate the grassroots. However, whether it is the "Promotion" or "Implementation" committee, both explicitly stipulate that they are directly under the Executive Yuan, so their status is equivalent to that of the ministries. The qualifications of the committee members in the "Implementation" aspect are all high-ranking officials above the rank of Simplified Appointment, while in the "Promotion" aspect, according to the provisions in the General Outline, they are all ministers, secretaries-general, and chairmen. How can this be justified?</p>
<p>Efficiency is valued in governance, and efficiency is greatly affected by the organization. Villages are indeed the cornerstone of the nation and society, and their prosperity and decline can affect the fate of the country. However, village construction is ultimately a part of the national policy of the political party, and it is not an excessive demand for the political party organization to take full responsibility for it. Even if the situation is urgent and the work is intense, why not designate one or two section chiefs in the relevant departments of each ministry to specialize in village affairs, formulate more practical principles, and, after approval by the Executive Yuan, distribute them to the provincial governments and special municipalities, allowing them to supplement them based on their specific circumstances? Then, issue a general order to the county governments to implement them in phases, granting them the special privilege of adapting to the environment under the condition that they do not violate the major principles, but requiring them to report the results on time to judge the performance of the county magistrate. This would be both direct and effective, achieving twice the result with half the effort. Otherwise, each of the committee members is already knowledgeable about everything and concurrently holds three or five important positions. If village work is added to this, frequently adding several meetings, even if they do not want to do things perfunctorily, their energy will be insufficient. To not apply practical methods to practical work and expect it to be successful is like climbing a tree to catch a fish. Moreover, China has always felt a lack of talent. There are many who engage in lofty discussions, but few who bury themselves in hard work. Now, according to the organization of the "Implementation" Committee, not to mention the high-ranking officials above the rank of Simplified Appointment, the section chiefs, section members who should be appointed, and the members of the attached "Design" Committee total about forty people. If we add the staff of the "Promotion" Committee that is yet to be established, there will be about a hundred people. These forty or even one hundred people must all be vigorous, energetic, and capable civil servants who are interested in and have researched village construction. Otherwise, they will not be able to use their talents happily, and the plans they come up with will be irrelevant and unhelpful. Why not directly assign these talents to village work, giving full play to their abilities on the spot, rather than having them waste away in a life of armchair strategizing? Wouldn't that be a pity?</p>
<p>Now, someone is suffering from internal decay and external paralysis, emaciated and on the verge of death, with only a breath left, not knowing if they will survive until tomorrow. Their parents are building temples for them and sculpting statues of gods, intending to seek miraculous cures from the immortals. Their hearts are pitiful, but their ignorance is extreme. Before the miraculous cure is obtained, the wood for the coffin has already been prepared. Moreover, the miraculous cure is not guaranteed to be obtained. Good doctors and good ministers share the same principles. In today's world, especially in governing today's China, one must be careful to prevent collapse and adopt emergency measures to preserve vitality. One must never again delay and procrastinate, trying to get by with superficial appearances. Village construction is like this, and so are all other constructions!</p>
<h3>The Italian Concession in Tianjin Will Be Returned to Our Country Today - Foreign Ministers Broadcast Speeches on the Significance of the Reception</h3>
<p>Tianjin, 13th (Central News Agency) - Regarding the return of the Italian Concession in Tianjin, an agreement was signed on the 14th of last month in the National Government building in Nanjing by Foreign Minister Chu Minyi of the National Government and Chargé d'Affaires Spinelli of Italy, representing the two governments. It was also decided that the handover procedures would be officially carried out in Tianjin on August 14th. It is learned that Chargé d'Affaires Spinelli of Italy, as well as the Director of the European and American Affairs Department and the Director of the Asian Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government, Fan and Xu, arrived in China from the capital a few days ago to preside over the handover.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 13th (Central News Agency) - On the 14th, our government will officially recover the Italian Concession in Tianjin. Foreign Minister Chu gave a radio address to the nation on the 12th titled "Respectfully Informing the People of the Country about the Reception of the Italian Concession in Tianjin." The gist of the speech is as follows:</p>
<p>Fellow compatriots, August 14th is the day we officially recover the Italian Concession in Tianjin. The Italian Concession in Tianjin should have been returned earlier, but due to the various attempts and conditions proposed by the former Italian government, it was not returned at the same time as other concessions. This year, as Italy itself has gradually stabilized, this issue can no longer be delayed. Thanks to the enthusiastic efforts of our ally, Japan, the situation took a sudden turn for the better, and we were able to achieve success. The agreement was signed on July 14th, and it was also agreed that the details of the agreement would be signed in Tianjin on the morning of August 14th.</p>
<p>After the return of concessions by various countries, many people have doubted the delay of the Italian Concession in Tianjin, wondering why the Italian Concession in Tianjin has not yet been returned. I would like to inform the people of the country that the reason why the Italian Concession in Tianjin has been delayed until today is that the Italian side naturally had its reasons for delaying the return. On our own side, we have been constantly anticipating, closely watching, carefully searching for opportunities, and firmly preparing our actions, without revealing anything or relaxing our efforts. The existence of the facts has already answered the doubts of the people of the country. I have nothing more to say here.</p>
<p>Continue to Resist Foreign Aggression</p>
<p>The Tianjin Concession is the last of the foreign concessions in China, and the return of the Italian Concession in Tianjin is also the last of the foreign concessions in China. From now on, the worries in the heart of China have been completely eliminated, and the great danger of China's demise no longer exists. I have two humble thoughts: First, the movement to recover concessions has been going on for decades. Countless lives and money have been sacrificed for this cause, but it has never been achieved. The Founding Father never forgot this matter and even left it in his will. This is no easy feat. But now we have finally received the last one. Another point is that the existence of concessions was indeed a worry in the heart of China, because the main reason for the establishment of concessions was for foreigners to destroy our country's base, and economic and cultural aggression were facilitated by the concessions, thereby undermining us. Our recovery of concessions directly reduces the pressure of aggression and indirectly saves us from demise. However, although the concessions have been recovered, will the foreign aggression and oppression be reduced? Will the salvation from demise be effective? Therefore, although the concessions have been recovered, our work of resisting foreign aggression has not ended, and our goal of saving hope has not been achieved. We still have intangible concessions that we should continue to recover, and we still have work greater than recovering concessions that we should continue.</p>
<p>Preserve Various Strengths by All Means</p>
<p>Now that the concessions have been recovered by us, we must not think that the work has ended and the hope has been fulfilled. We must recognize the life of the concessions, understand the soul of the concessions, add a new soul to their life, and give birth to a new body for their soul. If their effects and strengths are harmful to us, we should find ways to eliminate them. If they are beneficial to us, we should find ways to inherit them. This is the only way to live up to the success of recovering the concessions. Otherwise, although the superficial concessions have been recovered, the actual concessions still exist. Then, although the concessions have been recovered, there is no difference between recovering them and not recovering them.</p>
<p>Furthermore, although the concessions have been recovered, they also have their strengths, such as cleanliness, orderliness, perfection, and comfort. But they also have their weaknesses, such as licentiousness, extravagance, gangsterism, heavy social darkness, and dangerous and decadent lives. The strengths should be preserved by all means, and the weaknesses should be driven out and improved. This is the responsibility that all our compatriots should actively undertake.</p>
<p>Respectfully and Solemnly Thank the Allies</p>
<p>In addition, the return of the concessions by various countries this time was first advocated by our ally, Japan. In March of last year, Japan voluntarily returned all the concessions in various places without reservation, and completely abolished the extraterritorial rights enjoyed by Japan in China. The coordination of the allies also played a major role. As for the return of the Italian Concession in Tianjin this time, it was entirely due to the assistance of the allied governments. Therefore, China has been able to eliminate this century-old problem, and it can be said that it was entirely accomplished by our ally, Japan. Therefore, on the eve of the final recovery of the Italian Concession in Tianjin, I solemnly express my gratitude to our ally, Japan.</p>
<p>Pacific Area</p>
<p>Overall Battle Situation of the Japanese Army</p>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - In the South Pacific, air raids by our army on Rabaul have been very frequent this week, but the number of attacking aircraft seems to have decreased slightly. However, the number of air raids on Kapingamarangi Atoll in the Caroline Islands seems to have increased. At the same time, enemy aircraft have recently appeared in the Kavieng area. On the morning of August 11, nine enemy heavy bombers attacked a certain area in Sumatra. (1) In the Central Pacific, since July 31, when enemy forces on Tinian launched an offensive led by mechanized units and broke into the Japanese army's last line of defense, the front line in that area has been chaotic. Japanese army units are currently attacking enemy forces in various locations. Also, on Guam, after the Japanese army contracted and reorganized its line of defense north of Agana, it is now severely damaging enemy forces near the mountainous area northeast of Agana. However, since August 8, when enemy tank units have been separately and safely penetrating the Japanese army's positions in various locations, fierce battles are currently taking place day and night in this area. On the night of the 10th, enemy warships launched a fierce attack on the Japanese army's positions on both islands and dropped flares. Currently, the Japanese army on both islands is waiting to fully display the traditional spirit of Japan. On the evenings of July 25, 26, and 27, enemy forces used hundreds of carrier-based aircraft to attack Saipan and Palau. Subsequently, on August 4 and 5, cruisers and destroyers shelled Chichi-jima, but after the local Japanese army bravely fought back, they immediately shot down 41 aircraft and repelled the attacking cruisers.</p>
<p>Japanese Army in the Southwest Pacific, 13th (Central News Agency) - Enemy air raids in the Southwest Pacific are becoming increasingly fierce. On the morning of the 9th, about 50 enemy fighters attacked Port Moresby, New Guinea. The Japanese army destroyed one enemy heavy bomber. Also, on the morning of the 11th, about 20 bombers attacked Kamano, northwest of New Guinea.</p>
<p>The Fierce Fighting of the Japanese Army in Northern Burma</p>
<p>Northern Burma Front, 13th (Central News Agency) - The key point of Myitkyina in northern Burma has experienced four months of bloody fighting, with extremely fierce battles. The Nanyin River flowing north and south of Myitkyina has turned deep red. Over 10,000 troops of the Allied British and American forces fought to the death with the elite Japanese army. The Japanese army, outnumbered, fought to the last soldier. By the end of July, after four months of fighting, the enemy side had abandoned, captured, surrendered, and wounded over 15,000 soldiers. On August 2nd and 3rd, the brave Japanese soldiers who fought to the end withdrew from Myitkyina, moved their positions, and prepared for the next operation.</p>
<p>The Japanese Imperial Rule Assistance Association</p>
<p>Refreshes its Lineup</p>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) - The inauguration ceremony for the new president of the Japanese Imperial Rule Assistance Association, Kōbayashi Seizō, was solemnly held on the 11th of this month. All parties have great expectations for the new president to lead its members with his seasoned political experience. The reorganization of the association's internal affairs is especially anticipated by all parties. From now on, the resolution of the following issues will be used as an opportunity to establish a wartime posture that is in line with the times: (1) Improving relations with the new government, (2) Strengthening and refreshing the association's management and guiding principles, (3) Reforming new national organizations, and (4) Refreshing personnel organization. The adoption of a secretary-general system is also being considered in order to absorb talent and refresh the lineup within the association.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Aikawa Visits the Vietnamese Governor-General</h3>
<p>Saigon, 13th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Ambassador to Vietnam Aikawa, accompanied by Information Department Director Watanabe, arrived in Da Lat on the 9th. On the 11th, they visited Governor-General Decoux to exchange views on Vietnamese relations and the world situation. It is heard that the ambassador is scheduled to return here on the 14th.</p>
<p>Japan Actively Adjusts Coal Industry to Increase Production</p>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) - Coal is a basic raw material for military production. Japan's production situation from April to July of this year shows only a slight increase in output compared to the same period last year, and there is a huge gap compared to the ambitious production plan for this year. Therefore, establishing fundamental measures to increase coal production and implementing them rapidly has become an urgent task. In particular, the labor problem in coal production needs to be fundamentally resolved. The main points are as follows: (1) "Adjustment of Military Mobilization and Industrial Mobilization" Most of the coal mine workers who are drafted into the military are skilled workers, and their production capacity is equivalent to several unskilled workers. Coal is the foundation of strategy, and military mobilization and industrial mobilization must be fundamentally adjusted. (2) "Implementation of General Conscription" Although the conscription of coal mine workers has already been implemented, the recent implementation of designated conscription for experienced workers has failed to achieve the desired goal due to the insufficient number and quality of current coal mine workers. Therefore, general conscription must be implemented.</p>
<h3>Japanese Air Force Surprise Attack on Xi'an and Hanzhong Airfields - Aircraft and Military Facilities Destroyed</h3>
<p>Chinese Front Base, 13th (Central News Agency) - A bomber squadron of the Japanese Air Force launched a surprise attack on the Northwest Chongqing-American Air Force base, the Xi'an and Hanzhong airfields, in the late hours of the 11th, inflicting great damage. Despite the adverse weather conditions, the Japanese army destroyed two heavy bombers and burned seven heavy bombers at the Xi'an airfield, destroying two ammunition depots, one of which exploded, and starting fires in three places. At the Hanzhong airfield, two light bombers were burned and fires started in eleven places. The entire Japanese bomber squadron returned to base safely.</p>
<p>Chongqing Radio Broadcasts the Fall of Hengyang</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 13th (Central News Agency) - Chongqing Radio has acknowledged that Hengyang, a town in the Ninth War Area, has fallen, and believes that the Japanese army will continue to advance south. According to the broadcast, the Japanese army has been launching a fierce attack on Hengyang since August 4th, and on the 7th, they broke into the central part of the city. At that time, the commander of the defending army, Fang Xianjue, commander of the Tenth Army, requested instructions from the military authorities, and on the 8th, the city fell. Although the Japanese army may not advance immediately, they may continue to advance south in the future, aiming to open up the Yuehan Railway line or attack the American air force bases in the southeast.</p>
<h3>North China Development Board Adds Construction Team</h3>
<p>Beijing, 13th (Central News Agency) - The North China Development Planning Board previously reduced one section and two teams due to the establishment of the Police Labor Headquarters. Now, in order to expand the organization, it has added a construction team. This team is responsible for reviewing civil engineering, construction, and other construction projects related to development, as well as procuring the necessary materials.

<h3>The European War Changes Strategy - A Grand Decisive Battle Will Unfold in Normandy - The Main Force of the US Army Advances North Along the Sarthe River</h3>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) - German authorities told a group of reporters on the 12th: The strengthening of the anti-Axis forces in northern France may be the prelude to an unprecedented decisive battle between the two armies. The anti-Axis army originally attempted to sweep the German army's positions from the south along the Mantes-la-Jolie to the Loire River, which is the characteristic of the current battle situation. The US army will move north from Mantes-la-Jolie towards the German army's positions in Caen, while also advancing southeast from Caen towards Paris, uniting with the US army fighting in Brittany. However, this anti-Axis operation plan has only succeeded in one stage so far, that is, only the invasion operation in Brittany has been completed. Therefore, the anti-Axis army command has had to abandon its previous enterprise and return north from the Normandy front in order to isolate the German army in that area. In view of the above changes, it is feared that an unprecedented and unparalleled great naval battle will inevitably unfold.</p>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) - Transocean News Agency: The reinforcement of the anti-Axis army, after the US army crossed the lower Loire River, claimed to want to attack Bordeaux, which proves this. The enemy on the south side of the river is obviously carrying out reconnaissance activities or protecting the right wing of the US Third Army. Most of the US army has advanced to the northeast and north of the Sarthe River, and its purpose is obviously to directly target the rear of the German front line in Normandy, that is, to first occupy Alençon. Currently, the tank armies of the two armies are engaged in fierce fighting. The British Second Army on the left wing, between Mantes-la-Jolie, Rouen, and the Grimbosq Forest, has advanced slightly, which is in response to the Canadian army's attack on Falaise.</p>
<p>Surrounded German Army Firmly Refuses to Surrender</p>
<p>Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to news from the front last night: The anti-Axis forces have twice issued final ultimatums to the German army defending the port of Brest, urging them to surrender, but they have been rejected. The German army in Brest has been fighting bravely and holding the port since the 5th, when it was surrounded by the US army, and is still continuing to fight hard.</p>
<h3>The Battle Situation in the Vistula River Bend is Still Serious - The Soviet Army Failed to Cross the River</h3>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) - Transocean News Agency: The focus of the battle on the northern route of the Eastern Front is south of Lake Peipus and throughout Latvia. The Soviet army has been attacking for two days, attempting to break through the German army's retreat defense line with ten infantry divisions and three tank regiments, but their plan has not succeeded. The point of breakthrough has been blocked on the new defense line. The German army has achieved defensive victories in the eastern and southeastern parts of East Prussia. The Soviet army has the latest tank units there. Since the two cities of Wielbark and Niedenburg are still in the hands of the German army, it proves the Soviet army's offensive. The Soviet army on the Warsaw front launched another attack, but the German army's reinforcements have stopped the Soviet army's advance. The situation in the Vistula River bend is still serious. The Soviet army's goal is obviously to cross the river. The German army is now blocking its advance north and south of the Baranów Sandomierski bridgehead, but the southern position has retreated three kilometers, with the purpose of avoiding the German army being surrounded.</p>

<h3>City Authorities to Conduct Electricity Consumption Survey of Factories, Survey Forms Distributed to Manufacturers</h3>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Economic Affairs, the Bureau of Public Utilities, and the China Central Water and Electricity Company plan to convene specialized technical personnel from various bureaus in the near future to form a factory electricity consumption survey team. They will investigate the electricity consumption of the entire industrial production in the city, categorized by industry. For factories producing essential daily necessities and related to wartime production increases, electricity allocation will be appropriately increased to adapt to the wartime system and increase production. Survey forms for factory production and electricity consumption have been printed and distributed to manufacturers for completion. This matter concerns the overall adjustment of electricity consumption for all factories in the city. Manufacturers are requested to assist the authorities by providing accurate information.</p>
<p>Entertainment Venues Adjust Hours</p>
<p>After the municipal government authorities stipulated temporary measures to restrict the time of electricity usage for entertainment venues in order to conserve electricity, the police authorities immediately followed and strictly implemented the measures. Citizens have also strictly complied with and implemented these measures. The business hours of various entertainment venues have also been adjusted accordingly. Movie theaters and theaters have moved their evening shows earlier, with movie theaters starting their last shows at 8:00 PM and theaters starting their evening performances at 6:30 PM. Dance halls, cafes, and other restaurants have also closed at 10:00 PM since the 12th of the month. Lights in all hotels and apartments must be switched off by 11:00 PM. On the night of the 12th, when the electricity conservation measures were implemented, reporters inspected various districts and found that most people complied with the regulations. However, there were also those who violated the rules. According to the authorities, those who violate the rules will be severely warned in accordance with the municipal government's order. If they continue to offend, their electricity supply will be suspended, or their business license will be revoked.</p>
<p>Telephone Users Automatically Save Electricity</p>
<p>The China Central Electrical Communications Company has recently undergone changes to the "02" telephone exchange, increasing the burden on the exchange's efficiency. Therefore, the telephone bureau is requesting users to automatically conserve electricity. The main points of conservation are: 1. Avoid unnecessary socializing on the phone. 2. Telephone calls should ideally not exceed two or three minutes. 3. Do not make calls unless absolutely necessary.</p>

On the first anniversary of Restoration Day, August 11th, each county received instructions from the government to formally revert to using the name "County Government."</p>
<h3>The Problem of American Blacks is Getting Worse</h3>
<p>— Mr. Matsudaira Tadahisa, Information Officer of the Japanese Embassy</p>
<p>According to foreign telegrams: On the 2nd of this month, in Philadelphia, USA, due to excessive oppression of blacks by whites, black employees of public transportation such as buses and subways went on strike, followed by riots. The U.S. authorities finally mobilized the military to suppress them, resulting in thirteen people being injured. Another group of young black workers, armed with pistols, knives, sticks, and tiles, invaded the streets, resulting in the arrest of over three hundred people by the authorities. The city's transportation is now maintained by the military. As a result, the so-called "black race problem" is getting worse.</p>
<p>Last summer, black riots broke out in twelve cities in the United States over several weeks, resulting in six deaths and over sixty injuries. The most violent struggle was in Detroit. The reason was that since the war began, hundreds of thousands of blacks had moved there, and local white workers had repeatedly clashed with black laborers due to so-called racial animosity. In addition, groups such as the KKK organized oppression against blacks, trying to prevent blacks from living there after the war, causing blacks to be in a difficult situation with no houses to live in. Therefore, blacks used this as a motive to fight and riot.</p>
<p>The problem of blacks in the United States began at the beginning of its founding, when many black slaves were brought from Africa. Later, the United States caused the Civil War due to the handling of the black issue. Therefore, the black issue is an endless source of trouble for the United States. The author recalls his observations on the black issue in the United States during his service in the United States:</p>
<p>Inequality of Blacks in Social Life</p>
<p>Since Lincoln emancipated slaves, although the law prohibits the use of blacks as slaves, blacks still suffer extremely unequal treatment. This is an undeniable fact. There are fewer blacks in the western and northern United States, so the treatment they receive is unequal, but it is not very obvious. On the contrary, there are more blacks in the southern United States, so the reaction is more obvious. When the author first arrived in Washington, D.C., the first thing that surprised him was that the elevators used by blacks and whites were different. Black porters who carry luggage can only use the elevator used by whites when it is necessary to accompany the guest, otherwise they must use the elevator specifically for blacks. The author once asked a porter from the embassy to carry luggage into an apartment, and suddenly the porter disappeared. Later, he saw him taking another elevator upstairs. At that time, the author asked him, "Why didn't you take the same elevator as me?" He replied, "We blacks cannot take the same elevator as you." He further explained the general situation of their low social status. Also, when the author first arrived in the United States, his friend told him not to sit in the back of the bus, because if he sat in the back, he would be mistaken for a black person and be bullied. Later, when the author took the bus, he saw that the front and rear were divided into black and white.</p>
<p>If one goes to the southern United States, this situation is even more obvious, which is very unpleasant. In public toilets, there is a distinction between those used by whites and those used by blacks. Movie theaters, restaurants, and other public gathering places often have a sign that says "Whites Only." The author was in a small town in North Carolina when he saw a Japanese friend witnessing a black man being subjected to extreme torture. This kind of behavior is difficult to describe in words. In short, it is barbaric and inhumane. The author often questioned how this kind of behavior could be applied to human beings. At that time, if the situation were described in detail, it would be banned during inspection. After seeing this torture, the author felt nauseous and went to a nearby drinking fountain to rinse his mouth, and saw a sign that said "For Black People Only." The author still remembers this situation very clearly. The above examples are just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>Inequality of Blacks in Occupation</p>
<p>What is described here is that their status is slightly more advanced than slaves, but their industries are mostly labor, and the lowest-level labor, so they are all groaning in the lowest-level standard of living.</p>
<p>Recently, the education level of blacks has improved compared to the past, and there are many who have received university education, but their outlets are restricted, and it is extremely difficult to obtain an occupation with a slightly higher status in society. Black lawyers have no white people going to consult them, and black doctors have no white patients. Scholars cannot be professors in schools run by white people. Even citizens of Chinese and Japanese descent who have obtained American citizenship generally suffer the above situation in the United States. The most annoying thing is the inequality of blacks in occupation, which is even more obvious.</p>
<p>When the author was studying at the University of Michigan, he had a black classmate who was studying law. He often saw the professor despising him, and he often took a resistant attitude and asked the professor difficult questions to expose his incompetence. The author once asked him, "What will you do after graduation?" He said, "After graduation, I will work in a school run by blacks. There is no other way to find a job." He also expressed his indignation that there was only one black politician who was a member of the House of Representatives. There was an economics professor at the University of Michigan named Remer, the author of "The Foreign Trade of China." He lived in Shanghai for three years and seemed to have taught at St. John's University. He treated the Chinese with a friendly attitude - the attitude of dealing with servants. However, he treated blacks with a cold and disgusted attitude. He said, "I can use East Asians as my assistants, but no matter how smart blacks are, I will never use them as my assistants."</p>
<p>Among the blacks who are famous in the United States are the famous boxer "Louis" and the world sprint athlete "Owens," etc. However, American whites do not express happiness that blacks have become world masters, and say that their skills were learned from whites, so it is not surprising, and no matter how much blacks can exert their talents, they cannot guide whites. From the above, we can see their inequality in occupation.</p>
<p>Reasons for the Recent Deterioration of the Black Issue</p>
<p>The United States declared that this war was a war for the liberation of the oppressed. Black leaders pointed out: "There is still a distinction between black and white races in the United States, so it is contradictory to call this war a war for the liberation of the oppressed," and shouted "After the war, the oppressed state of blacks should be liberated" and "When discussing post-war issues, blacks should be given equal rights and a voice at once," etc. General blacks also echoed. Blacks also strongly demanded that there should be no distinction between black and white when serving in the military. Their requirements are roughly as follows: 1. Equality in factories, 2. Equality in the military, 3. Equality in legal and civic rights. Regarding the first point, because the United States is in a state of labor shortage, the proportion of blacks employed is relatively high, so this point has been largely improved. However, in military factories, blacks can only obtain jobs below the semi-skilled worker level, and the number is no less than several hundred people. The second and third points have not been considered by Americans at all, so blacks are extremely dissatisfied. This is one of the main reasons for the deterioration of the black issue. Also, there are very few blacks advancing into the industrial sector, especially in shipbuilding, aircraft, and electrical machinery manufacturing plants, etc. In the past, factories that blacks could not enter are now employing more blacks, and white labor will return after the war, so they have more animosity towards blacks. This is the second reason for the deterioration of the black issue this time. In addition, due to the excessive population in major industrial cities and the incompleteness of living facilities, the actual life is deteriorating, and the minds of both black and white races are restless, and their policies are inconsistent. As a result, this issue is difficult to resolve.</p>
<p>General Attitude of Blacks</p>
<p>The judicial authorities deliberately do not pursue the root cause of this issue, and although the federal government knows the importance of this issue, it is trying to suppress blacks for fear of frequent disputes in the country during wartime. Also, the members of the Southern Congressional Delegation and some conservative members of parliament absolutely oppose improving the status of blacks. Therefore, the industrial sector also does not consider hiring blacks, and white labor unions often exclude black workers. As for the general psychology towards blacks, it is as described above, containing a reactionary nature. Among them, only a few have sympathy for this issue. For example, the writer "McWilliams" advocates human justice and promotes that the federal government should resolve this issue. Also, Mr. "Weibaikai" of the wartime production authority's black employment training department said: It is urgent to improve the treatment of blacks and whites in the industrial sector and the military, and there should be no discrimination after the war, and a certain guarantee should be given.</p>
<p>In short: After this war, the black side has awakened, and although the white side knows something, the aversion to blacks is increasing. Although the general public knows a little about the importance of this issue, they have not considered it carefully, and those who know the root cause of this issue are also worried. On the other hand, the attitude of the authorities is only to take repressive measures every time an incident occurs, and not to solve the root cause of the issue. Therefore, it is predicted that the black issue will inevitably get worse and expand.</p>
<h3>Mortgaging of Major Materials Requires a Registration Certificate</h3>
<p>The Municipal Economic Council, in order to investigate the major materials in the city to prevent hoarding, has previously held a registration of major materials. In order to seek further statistics, it notified the Municipal Bankers Association and the Central Reserve Inspection Financial Affairs Office on the 21st of last month to cooperate fully. When factories or businesses use the major materials designated by the Ministry of Industry as collateral to borrow money from financial institutions such as banks or trust companies, they must submit the major material registration certificate issued by the Economic Council. Merchants in the city are requested to pay attention.</p>
<h3>Central Reserve Inspection Office to Establish Two Branch Offices</h3>
<p>The Central Reserve Bank Inspection Financial Affairs Office, in order to expand the inspection work of financial institutions in various places and promote sound and stable finance, in addition to establishing independent offices in Suzhou, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Bengbu, Hankou, Ningbo, and other areas, is planning to establish Guangzhou and Xuzhou branch offices.</p>
<h3>Examination Papers of Poor Students Have Been Graded</h3>
<p>The scholarship for poor students organized by the Municipal Education Association has received an unprecedented number of applications this year, so the screening examination was also particularly strict. The examination papers of more than two thousand students who took the examination were graded under the supervision of Mr. Liu Yangshan, the standing director of the association, until last night. A total of sixty high school students and three hundred middle school students were admitted. It is expected that the admitted students will receive their money on the 10th.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Fellow Association Welcomes Governor Chen</h3>
<p>The Guangdong Fellow Association in Shanghai held a tea party at the Guangdong Fellow Association in Shanghai on Jiangning Road at 4:00 PM yesterday (the 13th) to welcome Governor Chen Chunpu of Guangdong Province, who was passing through Shanghai on official business. Present were Liang Xiuyu, Director of the Municipal Propaganda Office, Ye Xuesong, Director of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, Feng Jie, Manager of China United Film Corporation, Yu Xijing, Xie Xiaochu, and dozens of others. Ye Xuesong gave a speech first, and then Governor Chen reported on the situation of the clearing of villages in Guangdong Province, eliminating bandits, ensuring security, and correcting ideas.</p>
<h3>Bicycle License Renewal to Begin Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau has decided to renew the second half of the year's bicycle licenses in the first district at the vehicle registration offices on Jiangning Road and Gongping Road starting tomorrow (the 15th). The bureau believes that there are a large number of bicycles in the city, so in order to avoid crowding, save citizens' time, and facilitate all bicycle owners to renew their licenses, it has stipulated that each vehicle registration office will handle a maximum of 500 bicycle license renewals per day. It has also designated the dates and locations for each bicycle to renew its license and publishes them in advertisements in various newspapers every day. Citizens are requested to cooperate and go to renew their licenses on time to avoid crowding.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Market Situation Stable Last Week, Prices of Daily Necessities Fall with Arrival Prices</h3>
<p>The financial and industrial market situation in Shanghai last week has become normal and stable. Because the Central Reserve credit regulation is becoming more smooth and the exchange of materials is more active than in the past, transactions are becoming more prosperous in the midst of easy money, and the prices of all industries are falling. The comprehensive short-term interest rate changed from rising to flat, the interest rate of the money industry remained unchanged at 3.7 cents, and the Joint Reserve Notes also did not change on the horizontal line. The Hua Gu stock market situation has turned to normal improvement because the government sent personnel to thoroughly investigate short selling and speculative transactions. The most optimistic thing in the price of daily food is that the authorities announced the restoration of household rice rationing and the doubling of household flour rationing, and the people's food has become greatly stable. The black market price of rice has fallen frequently by more than 20%, so the market prices of various daily necessities have fallen slightly. Although the factory industry in this week was affected by the restriction area, the production was affected, but according to the people in the industry, the production raw materials are easier to purchase than before, and the transportation is not much difficult. The factories of the main commodities necessary for the people are mostly working hard to increase production in order. Therefore, in view of this situation, the prosperity of the industrial and commercial sectors is promising.</p>
