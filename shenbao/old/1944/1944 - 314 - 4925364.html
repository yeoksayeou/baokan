<p>南京十三日中央社電　國府於十三日下午，接盟邦日本天皇陛下謹弔汪主席逝世唁電，茲錄如次：中華民國國民政府代理主，不勝痛悼。主席以中日兩國共存共榮之堅決信念，盡瘁於兩國緊密提携之强化，對於完遂與英美兩國之共同戰爭，及協力建設大東亞新秩序，　樹有絕大功績。對此偉大指導者之長逝，深表哀惜之情。並祈貴國官民敬承主席遺志，益與我國緊密協力，向完遂大東亞戰爭之途邁進。</p>

<h3>日本前首相　近衛公談話　謹對汪主席深致哀悼</h3>
<p>東京十三日中央社電　前日首相近衛文　公，自發表歷史的近衛聲明後，即與汪精衛氏區同盡瘁於中·日和平，汪氏逝世消息傳出後，公不勝哀悼，特發表談話，其大意謂：中國國府主席汪精衛閣下，未見中日全面和平偉業完成，即因病仙逝，本人謹對汪主席在天之靈，衷心表示哀悼。本人與汪主席初次會見，係爲大正八年（即民國八年）本人奉派出席巴黎和會時，當時汪主席以在野之身，聞居巴黎，其後音信皆無，及昭和十三年（即民國二十七年）十二月，本人第一次內閣發表聲明後，汪主席欣然　應，且冒險脫離重慶陣營。至昭和十五年（民國二十九年）六月，秘密蒞臨日本，余乃得再與關別二十年之汪主席會晤於東京本人私邸，京中日問題，開誠懇談。會談數次後，汪主席始終暢談中·日兩國立於平等立場，堅決提携建設東亞人之東亞。自英·美勢力下解放全東亞等抱負。本人對其勇氣與信念之堅强，自此更爲尊敬，余旣不諳華語，同時汪主席之日語亦不甚流暢。故於私邸談及二十年來巴黎闊別情形時，輒以紙筆代述，當時之筆錄，迄今保存無遺，偶一翻閱，則注主席之英姿宛在目前。因汪主席之仙逝，國民政府似失柱石，其前途或將更多困難，今後爲實現汪主席之意志，中·日兩國必須緊密握手，爲東亞全體，中·日兩國更應互相提携，中·日兩國唯此始能安慰汪主席大天之靈。</p>
<h3>滿張總理等　敬致弔意</h3>
<p>新京十三日中央社電　滿洲國張國務總理，武部總務長官，李外交部大臣，十二日下午八時半，訪問中國駐滿大使館，對汪主席逝世敬致弔意。張總理更代表全滿國民發表談話，深表哀悼之意，並　明今後與中國相　向聖戰完遂邁進之決意。</p>
<h3>東亞文學者大會　前日在京揭幕　通達　過設立東亞文藝院</h3>
<p>南京十二日中央社電　第三屆東亞文學者大會，於十二日下午三時，在我國首都南京中總文化協會，隆重舉行開幕典禮。推舉錢稻孫爲議長，陶晶孫爲副議長。首由議長致開幕會辭，嗣由串日各長官先生致訓及致詞。繼大會秘書處報告爲哀悼故注主席，全體肅立，靜默三分鐘。靜默畢，日本代表副團長高田稻治氏緊急動議，哀悼汪故主席。繼由日滿中代表等致詞，披瀝決意。大會臨時提議，通過向中日滿三國領袖致敬電，及致前方將士慰問電。七時許散會。</p>
<p>南京十三日中央社電　今日爲大東亞文學者大會之第二日，上午十時十五分開會，中日滿三國代表，就籌委會所提議案四項，作眞摯之討論後，即稍事休息，當休息時，並曾決定派遣大會代表，赴國府弔問汪主席。下午三時十分再行召開會議，分別提出設立大東亞文藝院·規定大東亞文學獎勵金·及發行三國代同雜誌各案，由全體一致通過後，即於下午六時餘散會。</p>
<p>三品報道部長致詞</p>
<p>南京十三日中央社電　第三屆大東亞文學者揭幕會議席上，日三品報道部長致詞如次：「大東亞戰爭乃爲革薪的建設戰爭，所謂革新所建設戰爭者，乃以東亞固有的王道文化，對抗西洋霸道的文化，進而使王道文化推廣至全世界。而王道文化係產生於東亞思想，即孫先生之世界大同之理想是也。在日本則爲「產靈思想」，此種思想所昭示者，乃爲「大道之行也天下爲公，選賢與能，講信修睦」，由此乃成「老有所終，壯有所用，幼有所長　孤獨廢疾者皆有所養」之社會，而能謀鑽而不興，盜竊亂變而不作，故外戶而不閉是謂「大同」，此實爲東亞的共同社會。吾人在此種理想中，已發見東亞民族國家之生存方法，政治獨立·民族自由·共同國防·經濟提携等課題，均應以東亞思想爲根據，而樹立此種思想之宣布與純粹思想之確立，實有賴大東亞各民族文化之講通，始能期待。當大東亞文學者大會開幕之際，余一介武夫，敢述鞠辭於諸君之前者，實因諸君在講通大東亞文化上拒任建設性之基本任務，深致敬意，並期待今後有莫大之發展。</p>
<p>松島部長演辭大意</p>
<p>松島部長致詞略謂，文學是人生的泉源，在世界文化的進展上，負有非常重大的使命。過去曾有過這樣的話，說作詩不如種田，然而我總覺得詩旣要作，田也要種。作詩的人有種田的義務，種田的人亦有作詩的權利。換句話說，在增加生產中，可以產生偉大的詩，可是在作偉大詩的時候，也需要有生產的生活。在大東亞戰爭苛烈的現在，多少文化人以文化戰士的名義活動在各處，創造着他們偉大的文學。我們再回轉頭來看中日兩國文化交流關係，其歷史的深長玌根源的悠遠，世界上沒有一國堪與倫比的。以燦爛的大東亞文化，光輝整個的大東亞，這亦是任何人皆不可否認的事實。罔倉天心先生曾說過「大東亞一體」，孫文先生亦說過「無日本無中國」，想到這裏，對於以中日兩國爲核心的東亞文化的交流，其實任之重大，實不容否認。大東亞戰爭是東亞民族解放的戰爭，日本在合菲海面獲得偉大戰果，已奠定東亞決勝的基礎，站在這樣優勢的東亞，各盟邦應如何去展開其積極的文化戰，這是挺身於文化戰城的各位，以堅强的團結，發動說利的攻勢。這正是最好的良機。</p>
<h3>日陸軍攻擊機　炸沉敵戰艦　在雷伊泰灣壯烈建功</h3>
<p>東京十三日中央社電　美軍始終欲以其豐富之物量，獲得侵攻菲律賓之有利形勢，不斷使軍需資材在雷伊泰島登陸，現在雷伊泰灣內正有敵運輸船五六十艘內外，驅逐艦數艘，或在停沿，或在遊弋，日軍航空部隊邇來協力陸上作戰之餘，連日連夜攻擊敵橋頭堡內之機場或中繼機場，阻止敵軍之陸上航空兵力向雷伊泰島伸張。同時，並連襲雷伊泰灣內之敵艦船，摧毀敵軍後方接濟基地，日陸軍特別攻擊隊之第一萬架隊，敢作必死必殺之拼撞攻擊，當炸沉敵戰艦一艘，運輸船一艘，使敵軍爲之震撼。萬朶隊於當日晨間，自基地出動，上午八時許飛入雷伊泰灣上空。田中曹長（上士）生由曹長搭乘第一機，首先直向敵運輸船一艘撞去，炸裂該船之中央致命處，同時負責掩護第一架，由渡邊伍長（下士）操縱之戰鬥機，亦繼續拼撞該船，敵大型運輸船之巨體，瞬即炸裂沉沒，此項壯烈戰果，經拖護飛行隊之菊池大尉確實認明。又佐佐木伍長搭乘之第聯合聲明　，與敵戰艦拚撞，久保軍曹（中士）駕駛之第二號，則撞入該戰艦該側海中就勢轉作活魚雷，撞在艦體炸裂，該戰艦受佐佐木久保二機必死必殺之攻擊，轉眼沉入雷伊泰灣底，此項戰果，經掩護飛行隊之生井大估確實認明。至於第三機則因飛入雷伊泰灣上空的發動機忽生故障，又折回基地，此等建立殊勳之萬朶隊隊員機，排除敵高射砲火之彈幕，與敵P38型機之防雷，悠悠然各自把握良好目標，敢於拼撞，尤其田中，生田之第一機，　悉目標，三度攻擊，作第二度攻擊時，正直衝敵船急行降下之際，猛見該船乃係醫院船，乃又轉舵上升，此舉試與敵美雖認明醫院船，仍加轟炸之行方相較，直判若震泥。舉例來說，日醫院船橋丸十一月六日上午十時許在匪律賓海面航行，即曾受敵艦載轟炸機數架之轟炸，此種行爲，眞堪痛憤。又該萬朶攻擊隊隊長若本大尉，園田，案藤，川高三中尉及中川少尉，則於該壯烈攻擊之前數日與敵機交戰，爲國犧牲。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>繼承遺志策進工作</h3>
<p>汪主席逝世後，企圖各地下旗誌哀。我們昨已爲文敬悼，並提出兩點，對於主席生前勳績表示崇敬，死後遺志應繼承發揚。綜觀主席一生精力，完全貢獻於祖國復興的道上。在其「自述」一文中，敘述壯歲時因獻身革命，連累長兄職位，乃以「家庭之罪人」爲名，馳書告兄，與家庭斷絕關係，以免長兄受累，情詞懇切，英氣蓬勃，有曰：「事已發覺，謹自絕於家庭，以免相累。家中子弟多矣，何靳此一人，望縱之俾爲國流血，以竟其志，死且不朽。」少壯之時，即以爲國流血爲志，其後艱險奮鬥，出生入死，無非貫徹其爲國流血之志。所以，我們今天追念汪主席，務必瞭解其遺志，竟共全功。</p>
<p>我們相信，國民政府的幹部中，頗多服　主席的品格學問，追隨工作有年。也有同過甘苦，共過患難的，對於主席生前謀國之忠，治事之勤，以至遺志何在，自然比較我們有更進一層的認識，有更進一步的哀思，同時，尤有更進一步繼承遺志促使實現的責任。不過，誠如日本前首相近衛公所說：「因汪主席之仙逝，國民政府似失柱石，其前途或將更多困難。」我們希望中樞當局諸公，爲應付更多困難的前途，爲實現主席的意志，特別需要下列兩事：</p>
<p>第一是團結一致，毋庸置疑的，中國政治史上常有人亡政息的事便，因爲官吏服務，往往有爲個人的知遇而用命者爲先，爲國用命者反在其次。一且領袖逝世，失却領導，人心渙散，消極以去。可是，現在的時代不同了，我們要完成國家獨立生存以外，還有大東亞各國的共存共榮。所以，官更服務的目標，是完成本身國家及大東亞的自由生存，不僅爲個人的知遇而用命，領導者雖有更換，而服務的目標則始終不變。因此，中樞官吏，無論過去追隨主席工作者，或與主席曾共患難者，或與主席共事者，彼此之間，應以國家及大東亞爲前提，應以實現主席的遺志爲前　提，加緊團結一致，在新領袖的領導之下，爲共同目標而加緊努力。</p>
<p>第二是吸引人才，國家今後的工作愈艱　，使命愈重大，舊的人才絕對不够，所以，吸引新進人才，頗爲亟要。因塥擇人，用人唯才。陳代主席在滬市收回租界周年紀念日，早經表示過，錄用人員絕無地域同鄕等觀念，而切誠所屬機關用人，也應保持此種風氣。同時，對於「事事無人，人人無事」的現象，引爲中國政府機關缺乏好事務官的通病。現在陳氏出任行政院長並代理國府主席，對於吸引人才與用人標準，自必胸有成竹了。</p>
<p>其次，在野人士，對於當前時局的嚴重性，更應充分認識，無論如何，消極的袖手旁觀，決非自全之計，理想與現實，都須積極去創造，我們很希望素手人望的在野人物，放棄等待主義，而從事積極工作，同時，希望政府當局虛心借得，愛護人才，使有協力的機會。</p>

<h3>市政諮詢委員　悼汪主席致詞</h3>
<p>汪主席逝世，噩耗傳來，舉國哀悼，本市市政諮詢委員會委員聞蘭亭，袁履登，林康侯，李權時，陳日平諸氏，特發表　詞如次：</p>
<p>聞蘭亭</p>
<p>「汪主席在國內以帶病之身，努力國事，因政務繁冗，不暇治療，捨身爲國，至深欽崇，嗣主席爲求健康恢復，俾能長期担當重任，乃渡日診治，經盟邦醫界傾力會診，仍未能掃除病魔，終至仙逝，本人聞訊，深表哀悼」。</p>
<p>袁履登</p>
<p>「汪主席一生爲國勤勞，自國府還都以來，關心國事與民情，尤爲深切，積勞成疾，經盟邦醫界盡最大努力療治，未能重復健康，担當復興中國重任，不勝悲悼，深盼後起者繼續汪主席未竟之志，本人謹代表全市商民，痛表哀悼」。</p>
<p>林康侯</p>
<p>「汪主席抱鞠躬盡瘁死而後已之精神，努力國事，一旦仙逝，全國同悼，主席身雖死，而精神將永留人間。主席臥病時，身雖在日療治，但心力長縈於國內，希望後繼者奉行遺志不報，並盼我工商各界於悲悼之中，仍照常工作，繼續營業，共慰英靈」。</p>
<p>李權時</p>
<p>「汪主席繼總理遺志，以「和平奮鬥救中國」，爲己任，不幸壯志未竟，在職身故，至深哀悼。主席於本年曾手訂施政三大綱領，即「確立治安，增加生產，肅正思想」，審判朝野，努力奉行主席未竟之志，尤以治安增產兩點，積極注意，以慰在天英靈」</p>
<p>陳日平</p>
<p>「國民政府主席王先生，不幸竟於本月十日與世長辭，噩耗傳來，舉國震悼，主席自弱冠追隨國父，致力革命，數十年來，飽經憂思，捨身救國之精神，中外莫不肅敬，卒至革命成功，奠定基業，中日事變發生後，主席爲本國父遺志，於來實現大亞洲主義，毅然發表艶電，倡導和平，還都白下，致力中日合作，進而締結同盟，奔走國事，不辭辛勞。當茲大東亞戰事方股，大亞洲主義逐步實現之秋，泰山遽而崩頹，吾人頓失領袖，此不僅邦國之災，實亦東亞之不幸也，吾人於主席領導之下，處於水深火熱之中，當如何各就本位，努力邁進，以期毋負主席遺志，而使大東亞戰爭早告完遂，大亞洲主義得能實現，庶幾主席在天之靈，亦可稍慰矣」。</p>

<h3>出淵部長　昨向重慶廣播　桂林柳州陷落應有覺悟</h3>
<p>桂林及柳州之陷落實給予渝蔣障暨以致命之打擊，盟邦上海陸軍部出淵報導部長，於十三日上海廣播電台，向重慶廣播。原文如下：此次日軍攻略桂林及柳州二地，重慶防衛之第一牙城，已告失陷，而今日渝方統治下之第一文化都市之桂林，及廣西省第二都市之柳州，均受兵火之洗禮，全成廢墟，重慶人士，有所惑乎？於本年四月我軍開始河南作戰，至今已有半載，於此期內，我軍已佔領河南省及湖南省之大半，廣東省及廣西省之一半，及浙江省福建省之主要部份，其他域可稱極大由戰爭而毀滅之都市，數達二十有餘，此次我方之作戰，已佔領京漢粵漢湘桂鐵道之全部沿綫，已割斷中國大陸之東西，重慶方面與太平洋方面之連絡，已完全斷絕，且重慶方面於渝南，廣東，江西之資源全失，並重慶方面之防衛綫已破，實足使渝方痛心也。此次我軍作戰之目的，在澈底擊滅敵美軍在中國大陸之勢力，而渝方之導入美軍勢力，至中國大陸，即爲此次，作戰之起因，而重慶將兵與美軍協力，乃自召流血之禍。桂林柳州之間樣悲劇，將方與未艾，其根本原因，在重慶人士之錯誤不醒也。戰禍所致，家破人亡，此乃無辜民衆之慘狀。我軍早已聲明「重慶將兵若不與英美協力，而來歸我者，則非敵人」，故我軍於作戰時間，極力保護中國無辜民衆之生命財產，而反之則敵美空軍破壞中國之文化經濟，殘殺人民，而使生靈塗炭，並於長沙，衡陽，　陵，賓慶，全縣失陷後，美空軍濫施盲炸，殺害中國人民，且以機槍掃射中國難民，實殘忍至極，而敵美空軍又侵入和平地區。總之，所受害者，均爲中國人民，在重慶之人士乎，汝若有家屬在和平地區，爲美空軍所殺害，汝有所感乎，總之，我軍之目的，在澈底擊滅美在中國大陸之勢力，重慶將兵乎，汝若迷夢不醒，將有更多流血之悲禍，使生靈塗炭，如何故而尚不覺悟？</p>

<h3>平部長　悼汪主席逝世　昨發表感想</h3>
<p>盟邦日本大使館上海事務所松平報道部長，於昨（十三）日下午二十半載報道常會席上，對汪主席逝世發表感想如次：</p>
<p>首次會見　影象深刻</p>
<p>「本人首次親見貴國汪主席時，遠在民國二十年前，當初在廣東，嗣後會見不下有數十次之多，令我最感有深刻之影象，即九一八瀋陽事變時至會談。於翌日十九日深晚十時，還訪汪氏私邸，報告六條　事件，幷交換意見。當時汪主席對滿洲事變深認遺憾非常，幷表示中國未有將此事擴大之意。惟中日關係，自廣東中國國民黨開始革命工作後，各地青年或一般民衆，雖對日本感情較遜，而具有相當知識之中國政治家，或中國負責之政治家，對斯現象，莫不表示遺憾，幷決心改變調整中日兩國之不良情形。當民國十二年時，日本遭遇大地震，消息傳至中國後，一部份人意認爲痛快，而中國之負責政治家，則對日本之地震，深表關懷同情，幷認爲日本乃中國之外國完了長城，中日兩國密切相關，即如日本損失，而中國亦受影響匪淺。當時中國負責之政治家，及共同商榷，將棉布衣服材料運送日本，撥助唄難日本國民，足見此爲中國對日本之同情心切。往往兩國間感情不洽，雖因此發生事變，而兩國關係理應謀取和平解決，轉禍爲福，此爲兩國政治家所急應做的。</p>
<p>一貫主張調整關係</p>
<p>本人對汪主席之談話，至今猶清晰回憶。嗣後汪主席主張一貫，覓求調整中日關係之途邁進，繼後撤消非常會議，渝蔣合作後，雖出任行政院長，並兼外交部長，對調整中日兩國國交之努力，始終不懈。當初華北方面，對中日雙方見之空氣，亦未改善，而汪先生在任時，則始終努力，於後野時有堅定中日合作之信念，並建議蔣介石，調整中日德國交上之關係，蔣大爲感動，乃意見一致，結果奉命出國，赴歐療養。受命赴德時，與德當局商榷中德間外交上頗多問題，任務偉大。故無論在朝在野，爲中日兩國之合作調整，努力貢獻，在中日事變後，仍一貫實現主張，以至於今。故汪先生之信念，令人欽佩良深，在中國歷史上，汪主席之言行及偉大意志，永留青史，值得全中國人所詡贊。今次汪先生不幸長逝，在中國，在東亞，痛失偉人，更希望中國四萬萬五千萬民衆，將汪先生遺志，永刻心銘，以求實現。</p>
<h3>汪精衛先生軼事</h3>
<p>— 之一</p>
<p>紀汪先生軼事，始見民國元年韓樹園（文舉）捫　談虎客錄，文曰：汪先生兆銘，字桂辛。（按先生字季新，又作李辛，見冀節蒹葭讀詩，此云桂辛皆粵語桂與季同音，故有此訛也。）廣東廣州番禺縣人，京籍浙江山陰縣，伊伯汪辛生，會充前粵督張文瀼幕賓。幼聰慧，下筆千言，其從見汪兆銓，字萃伯，舉人，會充粵水提李準幕賓，××亦舉人，會充前粵督岑春煊幕賓，均寄器之。年十七，應產子誡，得府案第一。是年壬寅，（按壬寅爲光緒二十八年，汪先生時年二十歲，此云年十七，有誤。）其胞兄兆鋐得縣案第一，兄弟同得府縣案元同補弟子員，洵舊日科舉時代之佳話也。</p>
<p>年以生元第四補舉生，諸生中鼎鼎大名，越甲股，岑春煊命藩斯選考舉貫員四十名。赴日本學法政。（按汪先生東渡入法政大學，時爲光緒廿九年癸卯，此云甲辰，按甲辰爲光緒十三年。當是癸卯之誤。）先生獲選，聯翩赴東入法政學校，校內四五百人，每期考試冠其舉。時心醉革命，孫公適在東，慕其才，以禮見，出資組立民報，聘爲編輯。（時汪尚未職業。）民報中有署名精衛者，汪之別號也（取精衛欲填恨海之意。）以第二人畢業。（第一人乃孔昭炎，廣東南海人，會充粵督幕賓。）畢業後，岑囑乃兄兆　，速其返粵，籌辦廣州法政學堂，汪與兄兩，言士各有志，不必相強，並預告聲明，已出汪族，日後有革命舉動，與兄等無涉，請存案，兆銓而覆岑。岑笑而；領之。</p>
<p>當時出其鋒銳文字，刊刻書報不一種，偏行國內外，各大吏雖禁販賣，然香港輸入者，仍不絕。洎至庚戌年汪以革命無成，就思以暗殺行其志，進都罔炸清監國，事敗爲偵吏執，民政大臣肅王在部，訊汪所爲，汪執筆直寫三千餘字，供詞大旨，上下古今，縱橫歐美，肅王服其論，請於清監國，免死，永遠監禁，案定送法部。司法大臣廷杰憤民政部之侵其　也，擬虐待汪，以旁泄其憤，欲以黑暗之囚牢處之，肅聞之不悅，幷出金二百，書十餘　，飭送法部交汪以示意，廷杰頑固且嫉，聞之盆憤，飭歸肅。肅言之清監國，監國　　，廷杰乃悻悻而罷。汪因此在法部，以書遺永日而已。</p>
<p>辛亥年秋九月，革軍勢大，監國不得已赦黨人，以期解救。於月之十六日，交旨赦汪等三人，交張鳴歧差委。汪先生出獄後，有人叩其行狀，汪病甚，且沈默久之，乃歷述在獄時之情況。調：「自入獄以來，項間即荷以鐵枷，其量甚重，非書生所能勝任，每日僅食稀粥一盂，及粗麵餅一撥。且不能以手取之，惟以口就食於架上而已。是日突有禁子掀門入，余正昏眩間，不料彼竟將吾項之鐵枷及吾手之鐵鎖解去，擁之出，吾眼已花，不知何往，以爲必殺我也，久之乃擁至一棧房，即歸瑪市泰安棧是。余尤大惑，豈於棧房殺我耶？禁子擁余至一房，即將行李交我，（即被獲時封存之行李。）幷交我銀百兩，調吾家中前時寄來者，幷殷殷向吾討喜錢，氽乃訝曰：「吾有何喜？」禁子告我曰：「爾已遇赦出獄矣。」幷示以當日之新聞紙數張，余此時更疑後遂昏昏睡去。今病仍偏身麻木，雖終日閱報紙，記載東南各省戰爭，然終疑爲未確，以爲僅入獄一年，吾國民進步，即若是之速耶！」叩以政見，而竟沈默，不肯一言。（錄自張江裁所撰「汪精衛先生行實錄」）</p>

<h3>Grand Encoffining of Chairman Wang's Remains; Central Government Holds Memorial Service; Funeral Committee Cables Various Regions to Establish Memorial Halls for Public Mourning</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 13th (Central News Agency) - The remains of the Supreme Leader, Chairman Wang, were respectfully transported back to Nanjing on the 12th. Yesterday, the 13th, at noon, under the leadership of Acting Chairman Chen, the grand encoffining ceremony was solemnly held at the National Government Auditorium. The auditorium was solemnly decorated with Chairman Wang's portrait hanging in the center. Wreaths presented by various heads of the National Government and foreign envoys were arranged on both sides. Chairman Wang's family and central government officials stood on both sides to witness the encoffining. Funeral music was played, and everyone stood in silence. The chief officiant, Acting Chairman Chen, took his place, followed by playing of the national anthem. All participants bowed three times to Chairman Wang's remains, and observed a moment of silence. After the silence, the encoffining proceeded. Led by Acting Chairman Chen, all those present circled the remains, paying their respects. Many mourners wept softly, overwhelmed with grief. Acting Chairman Chen then read the eulogy (read on his behalf by Chief Secretary Xu). The ceremony concluded at approximately one o'clock. The image and voice of our Supreme Leader have now departed from this world forever. Although Chairman Wang is gone, his spirit will endure for eternity. We firmly believe that, in the midst of our profound sorrow, our nation will strengthen its resolve, unite sincerely, inherit Chairman Wang's legacy, complete the task of national revival, and liberate East Asia, to comfort Chairman Wang's spirit in heaven. The eulogy reads as follows: "On this, the 13th day of November, the 33rd year of the Republic of China, Chen Gongbo, Acting Chairman of the National Government, with deepest sorrow and sincerity, hereby offers this sacrifice to the spirit of our Chairman Wang Gong: We recall that you, sir, were born into this world, endowed with intelligence and sensitivity, gentleness, respect, filial piety, and fraternity, swiftly achieving early success. Your learning encompassed both Chinese and Western knowledge, past and present, demonstrating broad insight and profound understanding. You cherished the hunger and thirst of all people, upholding the responsibility of every individual. You shouldered the great responsibility of the world, addressing the turbulence and external threats of the time, recognizing that revolution was essential for survival. Thus, you received guidance from the Father of the Nation, serving as a vanguard of the party, emulating the virtues of Yan Hui and Zeng Shen. Through arduous efforts, you shook the world, laying the foundation for revolutionary change and completing the great task of establishing a republic. Surely, you were far superior to Jing Ke and Gao Jianli. After the Father of the Nation passed away and the revolution suffered repeated setbacks, you strived to uphold his teachings, serving as the central pillar of our party. In the early stages of the Northern Expedition, internal strife was fortunately quelled. Yet, you pondered deeply and exhorted us to uphold our ambitions. But the tide of events diverged...eventually leading to the current situation, which spiraled out of control. Therefore, adhering to the Father of the Nation's Pan-Asianism, you faced numerous difficulties to revive the declining situation. The signing of the Basic Treaty not only established a grand plan for our nation for a century but also pioneered a new era of global peace. At this moment, when the realization of the East Asian co-prosperity is announced, you also succumbed to exhaustion, departing from our party forever. Alas! Our nation cannot be without you for a single day, nor can the world be without you for a single day. Why is Heaven so cruel, leaving such a loss to be felt for generations? How dare our party not follow your legacy, striving forward, revering your guidance as if you were still here? May your spirit never die, and may you watch over our nation and our people for thousands of years, always present. Accept this sacrifice!"</p>

I express my deep condolences for the passing of this great leader. I also pray that the officials and people of your country will inherit Chairman Wang's legacy, cooperate closely with our country, and move towards the completion of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) - His Majesty the Emperor of Japan was saddened to hear of the passing of Chairman Wang of the National Government. At 3:00 PM this afternoon, he dispatched his attendant, Tokuonji Sanetsugu, to deliver condolences.</p>
<h3>Former Japanese Prime Minister Konoe on Chairman Wang - Expresses Deep Condolences to Chairman Wang</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) - Former Japanese Prime Minister Prince Konoe Fumimaro, after issuing the historical Konoe Statement, dedicated himself to China-Japan peace with Wang Jingwei. After the news of Wang's passing was released, Prince Konoe was deeply saddened and issued a statement, the gist of which is as follows: Chairman Wang Jingwei of the Chinese National Government passed away due to illness before the great cause of comprehensive China-Japan peace was completed. I sincerely express my condolences to Chairman Wang's spirit in heaven. My first meeting with Chairman Wang was when I was dispatched to attend the Paris Peace Conference in Taisho 8 (1919). At that time, Chairman Wang was in Paris as a non-government figure. After that, there was no news from him. After my first cabinet issued a statement in December of Showa 13 (1938), Chairman Wang gladly responded and risked his life to break away from the Chongqing camp. In June of Showa 15 (1940), he secretly came to Japan, and I was able to meet Chairman Wang again at my private residence in Tokyo after 20 years. We talked candidly about the China-Japan problem. After several meetings, Chairman Wang always spoke of China and Japan standing on equal footing, firmly cooperating to build East Asia for East Asians, and liberating the entire East Asia from the influence of the United States and Great Britain. From then on, I became more respectful of his courage and strong belief. Because I was not familiar with Chinese, and Chairman Wang's Japanese was not very fluent, when we talked about our reunion in Paris 20 years ago at my private residence, we used paper and pens to communicate. The notes from that time are still preserved. When I occasionally read them, I feel as if Chairman Wang's heroic bearing is still before my eyes. With Chairman Wang's passing, the National Government seems to have lost its pillar, and its future may be more difficult. In order to realize Chairman Wang's will, China and Japan must hold hands tightly and cooperate with each other for the sake of all of East Asia. Only in this way can China and Japan comfort Chairman Wang's spirit in heaven.</p>

<p>Speech by Minister of Information, Misawa</p>
<p>Nanjing, 13th (Central News Agency) - At the opening meeting of the Third Greater East Asia Literary Conference, Japanese Minister of Information Misawa said the following: "The Greater East Asia War is a revolutionary war of construction. The so-called revolutionary war of construction is to use the East Asian inherent Royal Way culture to resist the tyrannical Western culture, and then to promote the Royal Way culture to the whole world. The Royal Way culture originates from East Asian thought, that is, Sun Yat-sen's ideal of Great Harmony in the world. In Japan, it is the "spirit of creation" ideology. What this ideology shows is "When the Great Way prevails, the world is for all. Select the virtuous and able, and practice sincerity and harmony," from which a society of "The old are cared for until death, the strong are employed, the young are nurtured, and the lonely, widowed, and disabled are all cared for." Then conspiracies will not arise, and theft, rebellion, and change will not occur, so the outer doors are not closed. This is called "Great Harmony," which is actually the common society of East Asia. In this ideal, we have discovered the survival method of East Asian nation-states. Political independence, national freedom, common national defense, economic cooperation, and other topics should all be based on East Asian thought. The announcement of this kind of thought and the establishment of pure thought depend on the communication of cultures among the various ethnic groups in Greater East Asia before they can be expected. At the opening of the Greater East Asia Literary Conference, I, a mere military man, dare to express my respects to you, because you are responsible for the constructive basic tasks in communicating the culture of Greater East Asia, and I pay my deep respects and look forward to greater development in the future."</p>
<p>Summary of Minister Matsushima's Speech</p>
<p>Minister Matsushima said in his speech that literature is the source of life and has a very important mission in the progress of world culture. In the past, there was a saying that writing poetry is not as good as farming, but I always feel that poetry should be written and farming should be done. Those who write poetry have the obligation to farm, and those who farm also have the right to write poetry. In other words, great poetry can be produced in the increase of production, but when writing great poetry, there also needs to be a life of production. In the current severe Greater East Asia War, many cultural figures are active everywhere in the name of cultural warriors, creating their great literature. If we look back at the cultural exchange relationship between China and Japan, its historical depth and the remoteness of its roots cannot be compared to any other country in the world. The brilliant Greater East Asian culture illuminates the entire Greater East Asia, which is also a fact that no one can deny. Mr. Okakura Tenshin once said "Greater East Asia is one body", and Mr. Sun Yat-sen also said "Without Japan, there is no China". Thinking of this, the importance of cultural exchange in East Asia with China and Japan as the core cannot be denied. The Greater East Asia War is a war of liberation for the East Asian nations. Japan has achieved great results in the waters of the Philippines, laying the foundation for the decisive battle in East Asia. Standing on such an advantageous position in East Asia, how should the allied countries launch an active cultural war? This is the best opportunity for you who stand in the cultural battlefield to launch a successful offensive with strong unity.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Attack Plane Sinks Enemy Battleship; Heroic Achievement in Leyte Gulf</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) - The U.S. military has consistently sought to use its abundant material resources to gain a favorable position in the invasion of the Philippines, continuously landing military supplies on Leyte Island. There are currently 50 to 60 enemy transport ships, as well as several destroyers, either docked or patrolling in Leyte Gulf. While cooperating with ground operations, the Japanese air force has been attacking enemy airfields or relay airfields in the bridgehead day and night, preventing the expansion of enemy land-based air power towards Leyte Island. At the same time, they have also been attacking enemy warships in Leyte Gulf, destroying the enemy's rear supply base. The 10,000th Unit of the Japanese Army Special Attack Force, making a daring suicidal attack, sank one enemy battleship and one transport ship, shocking the enemy. The Mandor Unit departed from its base in the morning and flew into the airspace over Leyte Gulf at approximately 8:00 AM. Sergeant (Staff Sergeant) Tanaka, piloting the first plane, flew straight towards one of the enemy transport ships, detonating it in the central, vital area. At the same time, the fighter plane piloted by Lance Corporal (Private First Class) Watanabe, responsible for covering the first plane, continued to crash into the ship. The large transport ship was instantly blown apart and sunk. This heroic result was confirmed by Captain Kikuchi of the escort flight. Furthermore, Lance Corporal Sasaki, piloting the second plane, crashed into an enemy battleship. Sergeant (Corporal) Kubo, piloting the third plane, crashed into the sea next to the battleship, turning into a live torpedo and detonating against the hull. Under the suicidal attacks of Sasaki and Kubo, the battleship quickly sank to the bottom of Leyte Gulf. This result was confirmed by Major Iwai of the escort flight. As for the third plane, its engine suddenly malfunctioned while flying into the airspace over Leyte Gulf, and it returned to base. These members of the Mandor Unit, who established extraordinary merit, dodged the barrage of enemy anti-aircraft fire and the torpedoes of enemy P38s, calmly chose their targets and dared to crash into them. In particular, Tanaka and Ikuta of the first plane, after accurately identifying the target, attacked three times. During the second attack, as they were diving straight towards the enemy ship, they suddenly saw that the ship was a hospital ship. They then turned the rudder and ascended. This action, compared to the enemy Americans who continue to bomb even after identifying a hospital ship, is like the difference between heaven and earth. For example, the Japanese hospital ship Hashimaru was bombed by several enemy carrier-based bombers while sailing in Philippine waters at approximately 10:00 AM on November 6th. This behavior is truly infuriating. Furthermore, Captain Wakamoto, the commander of the Mandor Attack Unit, as well as Lieutenants Sonoda, Ando, Kawashima, and Second Lieutenant Nakagawa, fought the enemy planes several days before the heroic attack and sacrificed themselves for the country.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Inheriting the Legacy and Promoting the Work</h3>
<p>After the death of Chairman Wang, efforts were made across various regions to lower flags and express grief. We have already written an article expressing our respect and mourning, and put forward two points: we should express our respect for Chairman Wang's merits during his lifetime and inherit and carry forward his legacy after his death. Looking at Chairman Wang's life, his energy was completely devoted to the road of national revival. In his "Autobiography," he described how, when he dedicated himself to the revolution in his youth, he implicated his elder brother's position. He then used the name "sinner of the family" to write to his brother, severing relations with the family to avoid implicating his elder brother. The words were sincere and the spirit was vigorous. He said, "The matter has been discovered. I hereby sever myself from the family in order to avoid implicating them. There are many children in the family, why begrudge this one person? I hope they will let him shed blood for the country to fulfill his ambition, so that he will not die in vain." In his youth, he aspired to shed blood for the country. Afterwards, he struggled through hardships, risking his life, all to carry out his ambition to shed blood for the country. Therefore, today, when we remember Chairman Wang, we must understand his legacy and achieve complete success together.</p>
<p>We believe that among the cadres of the National Government, many admire Chairman Wang's character and learning, and have followed his work for many years. There are also those who have shared hardships and difficulties with him. They naturally have a deeper understanding and grief for Chairman Wang's loyalty to the country, diligence in his work, and the location of his legacy, compared to us. At the same time, they have an even greater responsibility to inherit his legacy and promote its realization. However, as former Japanese Prime Minister Prince Konoe said, "With Chairman Wang's death, the National Government seems to have lost its pillar, and its future may be more difficult." We hope that the central authorities will pay special attention to the following two things in order to cope with the more difficult future and realize Chairman Wang's will:</p>
<p>The first is to unite as one. There is no doubt that in Chinese political history, there have often been incidents of policies dying with the person. This is because officials often prioritize serving those who appreciate them personally, while serving the country comes second. Once the leader passes away, leadership is lost, people's hearts become scattered, and they become passive. However, the current era is different. We not only want to achieve national independence and survival but also the co-existence and co-prosperity of all countries in Greater East Asia. Therefore, the goal of officials serving is to complete the free survival of their own country and Greater East Asia, not just to serve those who appreciate them personally. Although the leaders may change, the goal of service remains unchanged. Therefore, central government officials, whether they have followed Chairman Wang's work in the past, or have shared hardships with Chairman Wang, or have worked with Chairman Wang, should prioritize the country and Greater East Asia, and should prioritize the realization of Chairman Wang's legacy. They should strengthen unity and work hard for common goals under the leadership of the new leader.</p>
<p>The second is to attract talents. The country's work in the future will become more difficult and the mission will become more important. The old talents are definitely not enough. Therefore, attracting new talents is extremely important. They should choose people based on virtue and employ people based on talent. Acting Chairman Chen stated at the anniversary of the recovery of the concessions in Shanghai that there would be no regional or hometown prejudices in the recruitment of personnel, and that all subordinate agencies should maintain this kind of atmosphere in the employment of personnel. At the same time, he cited the phenomenon of "no one doing anything, and everyone doing nothing" as a common problem in Chinese government agencies due to a lack of good civil servants. Now that Mr. Chen has been appointed as the President of the Executive Yuan and Acting Chairman of the National Government, he must have a clear plan for attracting talent and setting standards for employment.</p>
<p>Secondly, people in opposition should fully recognize the seriousness of the current situation. In any case, passively standing by is definitely not a plan for self-preservation. Ideals and reality must be actively created. We very much hope that respected figures in opposition will abandon their waiting attitude and engage in active work. At the same time, we hope that the government authorities will humbly listen, cherish talent, and provide opportunities for cooperation.</p>

<h3>Anniversary of the National Socialist Party in Power – Speech by the German Head of State – Striving for Freedom</h3>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) – German news reports: Members of the German National People's Assault Team took their oaths of office during the celebration of the historically significant anniversary of November 192[3] (the commemoration was postponed to Sunday). The German Head of State Hitler issued a proclamation to the nation, stating: "For the rest of my life, Germany will never share its fate with European nations trampled by Bolshevism. As long as I have breath, I will concentrate my efforts to ensure that the German people resist the most terrible danger. Due to the needs of the total war effort, I have had to postpone the commemoration of November 9, 1923, to Sunday. The work of the General Headquarters also does not allow me to leave for a single day, but besides this, I believe it is my responsibility to prepare and implement the various measures necessary for the final victory in this war, which is more important than delivering a speech. (Omission) I believe that the period of hardship will be overcome by us, and the precious period will eventually arrive. Due to our work and sacrifices, the time of success is not far away. The purpose of our struggle remains unchanged, namely, to relieve the suffering of our people and to seek the safety of life for future generations.

<h3>Municipal Consultation Committee Members Express Condolences for Chairman Wang's Passing</h3>
<p>The news of the passing of Chairman Wang has been met with national mourning. The Shanghai Municipal Consultation Committee members Wen Lanting, Yuan Ludeng, Lin Kanghou, Li Quanshi, and Chen Riping have specifically issued statements as follows:</p>
<p>Wen Lanting</p>
<p>"Chairman Wang has worked diligently for national affairs despite his illness. Because of the heavy workload, he had no time for treatment, and he sacrificed himself for the country, which is deeply admired. Later, in order to restore his health so that he could take on heavy responsibilities for a long time, he went to Japan for treatment. Despite the best efforts of the medical community in the Allied nations, they were unable to eliminate the disease demon, and he eventually passed away. I express my deepest condolences upon hearing the news."</p>
<p>Yuan Ludeng</p>
<p>"Chairman Wang worked tirelessly for the country throughout his life. Since the return of the National Government to the capital, he has been deeply concerned about national affairs and the people's well-being. He fell ill due to overwork, and despite the best efforts of the medical community in the Allied nations to treat him, he was unable to regain his health and take on the heavy responsibility of restoring China. I am deeply saddened. I sincerely hope that future generations will continue Chairman Wang's unfinished aspirations. I hereby represent the merchants and residents of the entire city in expressing my deep condolences."</p>
<p>Lin Kanghou</p>
<p>"Chairman Wang embraced the spirit of giving his all until his last breath and worked diligently for national affairs. His sudden passing has been mourned by the entire nation. Although the Chairman has passed away, his spirit will live on forever. When the Chairman was ill, although he was being treated in Japan, his heart and mind were always focused on the country. I hope that his successors will follow his legacy and not report back. I also hope that our industrial and commercial sectors will continue to work as usual and continue their business amidst the mourning, to comfort his spirit."</p>
<p>Li Quanshi</p>
<p>"Chairman Wang continued Prime Minister Sun Yat-sen's legacy, taking 'Peaceful Struggle to Save China' as his mission. Unfortunately, he passed away in office before his great ambitions could be realized, and I am deeply saddened. This year, the Chairman personally drafted three major policy guidelines, namely, 'Establishing Security, Increasing Production, and Rectifying Thought.' The courts and the people should strive to implement the Chairman's unfinished aspirations, especially paying close attention to the two points of security and production, to comfort his spirit in heaven."</p>
<p>Chen Riping</p>
<p>"President Wang of the National Government unfortunately passed away on the 10th of this month. The sad news has shocked and mourned the entire nation. Since his youth, the President followed the Founding Father and devoted himself to the revolution. For decades, he endured worries and thoughts, and his spirit of sacrificing himself to save the country was respected by all at home and abroad. Finally, the revolution succeeded and laid the foundation for the cause. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the President, in order to uphold the legacy of the Founding Father and realize Pan-Asianism, resolutely issued a famous telegram advocating peace, returning to the capital of Nanjing, and devoting himself to Sino-Japanese cooperation, and then concluded an alliance, traveling for national affairs and sparing no effort. At this time, when the Greater East Asia War is just beginning and Pan-Asianism is gradually being realized, Mount Tai has suddenly collapsed, and we have suddenly lost our leader. This is not only a disaster for the nation, but also a misfortune for East Asia. Under the leadership of the President, we are in deep water and dire straits. How should we each stay in our positions and strive forward, so as not to fail the President's legacy and to bring the Greater East Asia War to an early conclusion, and to make Pan-Asianism able to be realized, so that the President's spirit in heaven can be slightly comforted."</p>
<h3>Secretary-General Wu Appointed to Act on Behalf of Municipal Affairs – Mayor Chen Orders Him to Act on Behalf of the Mayor's Duties</h3>

The original order is recorded as follows: "As the Mayor is going to Nanjing for official business, all mayoral duties will be delegated to Secretary-General Wu Songgao to act on his behalf from today. Apart from separate orders, this order is hereby issued for your information."</p>
<h3>Minister Izubuchi Broadcast to Chongqing Yesterday – Should Be Aware of the Fall of Guilin and Liuzhou</h3>
<p>The fall of Guilin and Liuzhou has dealt a fatal blow to Yu (Chongqing) and Chiang (Kai-shek). Izubuchi, Reporting Minister of the Shanghai Army Department of the Allied Nations, broadcast to Chongqing from the Shanghai Broadcasting Station on the 13th. The original text is as follows: With the Japanese army's capture of Guilin and Liuzhou, the first defensive stronghold of Chongqing has fallen, and today Guilin, the first cultural city under Yu's rule, and Liuzhou, the second city of Guangxi Province, have both been washed by the flames of war and have become ruins. Are the people of Chongqing confused? Since our army began the Henan Operation in April of this year, half a year has passed. During this period, our army has occupied most of Henan Province and Hunan Province, half of Guangdong Province and Guangxi Province, and the main parts of Zhejiang Province and Fujian Province. In other areas, there are more than twenty cities that can be described as extremely devastated by the war. In this operation, our side has occupied the entire line of the Jinghan, Yuehan, and Xiang Gui railways, cutting off the east and west connections of mainland China. The connection between Chongqing and the Pacific is completely severed, and Chongqing has lost all the resources in southern Yu, Guangdong, and Jiangxi. Furthermore, Chongqing's defense line has been broken, which is enough to make Yu feel heartbroken. The purpose of this operation is to thoroughly destroy the enemy's U.S. military forces in mainland China. The introduction of U.S. military forces to mainland China by Yu is the cause of this operation, and the cooperation of Chongqing's soldiers and the U.S. military is self-inflicted bloodshed. The tragedy between Guilin and Liuzhou is just beginning. The root cause is the error and lack of awareness among the people of Chongqing. The devastation of war, the destruction of families, and the death of people are the tragic situation of innocent civilians. Our army has long stated that "Chongqing's soldiers who do not cooperate with the British and Americans but come to us are not enemies." Therefore, our army makes every effort to protect the lives and property of innocent Chinese civilians during operations. On the contrary, the enemy's U.S. air force destroys Chinese culture and economy, kills people, and causes suffering, and after the fall of Changsha, Hengyang, Guilin, Binyang, and Quanzhou, the U.S. air force indiscriminately carries out blind bombings, killing Chinese people, and even using machine guns to strafe Chinese refugees, which is extremely cruel. Furthermore, the enemy's U.S. air force invades peaceful areas. In short, those who suffer are all Chinese people. People in Chongqing, if you have family members in peaceful areas who have been killed by the U.S. air force, do you feel anything? In short, the purpose of our army is to thoroughly destroy U.S. forces in mainland China. Chongqing's soldiers, if you do not wake up from your dreams, there will be more bloody tragedies, causing suffering to the people. Why are you still not aware?</p>

The text of the regiment's telegram is recorded below: To Secretary-General Lin of the Nanjing China Youth Model Corps Headquarters: The leader has strived for revolution, and his contributions are to the Party and the nation. His sudden death has been mourned by the entire country! Our comrades in this country feel especially sad. The cadres in Shanghai have gathered and discussed that they propose that you initiate the construction of full-body bronze statues of the leader in the capital, Shanghai, and other major cities for people to look up to and to make him immortal. This telegram is respectfully sent to you. We await your sincere reply. The Fourth Regiment bows.</p>
<h3>Minister Hei Expresses His Condolences for Chairman Wang's Passing – Expressed His Thoughts Yesterday</h3>
<p>Mr. Matsudaira, the Reporting Minister of the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy, expressed his thoughts on the passing of Chairman Wang at the semi-annual reporting meeting yesterday (the 13th) as follows:</p>
<p>Deep Impression of the First Meeting</p>
<p>"I first saw your country's Chairman Wang as early as twenty years ago, in Guangdong. Since then, I have met him dozens of times. The image that impresses me the most is the meeting during the September 18th Shenyang Incident. On the following day, the 19th, at 10 p.m., I also visited Mr. Wang's private residence to report on the Six-Article Incident and exchange opinions. At that time, Chairman Wang deeply regretted the Manchurian Incident and expressed that China had no intention of escalating the matter. However, although the feelings of young people or the general public in various places towards Japan were not as good after the Chinese Kuomintang in Guangdong began its revolutionary work, Chinese politicians with considerable knowledge or responsible Chinese politicians expressed their regret for this phenomenon and were determined to change and adjust the bad situation between China and Japan. When Japan encountered a major earthquake in the 12th year of the Republic of China, some people thought it was happy after the news spread to China, while responsible Chinese politicians expressed deep concern and sympathy for the earthquake in Japan, and believed that Japan was a foreign great wall of China. China and Japan are closely related, and Japan's losses also affect China significantly. At that time, responsible Chinese politicians discussed together and transported cotton cloth and clothing materials to Japan to help the disaster-stricken Japanese people, which shows China's deep sympathy for Japan. Although disagreements between the two countries often lead to incidents, the relationship between the two countries should seek a peaceful solution and turn misfortune into blessing, which is what politicians of both countries should do urgently.</p>
<p>Consistently Advocated Adjusting Relations</p>
<p>I still clearly remember my conversation with Chairman Wang. Since then, Chairman Wang has consistently advocated seeking ways to adjust the relationship between China and Japan. After the abolition of the extraordinary meeting and the cooperation between Yu and Chiang, he served as the President of the Executive Yuan and concurrently as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and he never ceased his efforts to adjust the diplomatic relations between China and Japan. At first, the atmosphere in North China for Sino-Japanese relations did not improve, but Mr. Wang always worked hard during his tenure. Later, he had a firm belief in Sino-Japanese cooperation and suggested to Chiang Kai-shek to adjust the relations between China, Japan, and Germany. Chiang was greatly moved, and they reached a consensus. As a result, he was ordered to go abroad to Europe for medical treatment. When he was ordered to go to Germany, he discussed many diplomatic issues between China and Germany with the German authorities, which was a great task. Therefore, whether in or out of office, he made efforts and contributions to the cooperation and adjustment between China and Japan. After the Sino-Japanese Incident, he still consistently implemented his advocacy to this day. Therefore, Mr. Wang's beliefs are deeply admirable. In Chinese history, Chairman Wang's words and deeds and great will will be forever recorded in history and are worthy of praise from all Chinese people. Now, Mr. Wang has unfortunately passed away, and China and East Asia have lost a great man. It is hoped that the 450 million Chinese people will engrave Mr. Wang's legacy in their hearts in order to realize it."</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of Mr. Wang Jingwei</h3>
<p>— Part 1</p>
<p>Anecdotes of Mr. Wang began appearing in the *Tan Hu Ke Lu* ("Records of a Tiger-Talking Guest") by Han Shuyuan (Wenju) in the first year of the Republic (1912). The text says: "Mr. Wang Zhaoming, styled Guixin." (Note: The Mr. Wang’s styled name was Jixin, also written Lixin, as seen in Ji Jie's *Jian Jia Du Shi* ["Reading Poetry in Jian and Jia"]. This says Guixin is a Cantonese pronunciation where "Gui" sounds like "Ji," hence the error.) He was from Panyu County, Guangzhou, Guangdong, with his ancestral home in Shanyin County, Zhejiang. His uncle, Wang Xinsheng, once served as a guest in the entourage of the former Guangdong Governor-General Zhang Wenxuan. He was intelligent from a young age, writing thousands of words effortlessly. His cousin, Wang Zhaoquan, styled Cuibo, a *juren* graduate, also served as a guest in the entourage of Guangdong Naval Commissioner Li Zhun. Another cousin, ××, also a *juren*, served as a guest in the entourage of the former Guangdong Governor-General Cen Chunxuan. All placed great expectations on him. At the age of seventeen, he sat for the county-level examination and ranked first in the prefectural exam. That year was Renyin (Note: Renyin was the 28th year of Guangxu, when Mr. Wang was twenty years old; this says he was seventeen, an error.) His elder brother, Zhaohong, ranked first in the county exam. The brothers both ranked first in the prefectural and county exams and were concurrently admitted as students of the Imperial Academy, truly a fine tale from the old imperial examination era.</p>
<p>He ranked fourth in the provincial examination and was a well-known figure among the students. During the Jia Chen year, Cen Chunxuan ordered Fan Sixuan to examine forty candidates from among those with examination credentials. They were to go to Japan to study law and political science. (Note: Mr. Wang went to Japan to enter Hosei University in the 29th year of Guangxu, which was Guimao. This says it was Jia Chen, which was the 13th year of Guangxu. This must be an error for Guimao.) Mr. Wang was selected, and he went to Japan to enter Hosei School. There were four or five hundred people in the school, and he topped the exams every term. At that time, he was deeply immersed in the revolution. Sun Yat-sen happened to be in Japan and admired his talent. He met him with courtesy, provided funds to establish *Min Bao* ("The People's Paper"), and hired him as an editor. (At that time, Wang had not yet taken up any profession.) Among the names signed in the *Min Bao*, "Jingwei" was another name of Wang. (It was taken to mean "Jingwei wishes to fill the Sea of Regret.") He graduated second in his class. (The first was Kong Zhaoyan from Nanhai, Guangdong, who once served as a guest in the entourage of the Guangdong Governor-General.) After graduation, Cen instructed his elder brother Zhaoquan to quickly have him return to Guangdong to prepare for the establishment of the Guangzhou School of Law and Political Science. Wang and his brother said that each person has their own ambitions and should not force others. He also gave advance notice and declared that he had left the Wang clan and that any revolutionary actions he took in the future would have nothing to do with his brothers, requesting that this be put on record. Zhaoquan reported this to Cen. Cen smiled and acknowledged it.</p>
<p>At that time, his sharp articles were published in various books and newspapers and spread widely at home and abroad. Although the major officials forbade their sale, those imported through Hong Kong continued to come in without end. By the Gengxu year (1910), Wang, feeling that the revolution had not been successful, considered assassination to achieve his ambitions. He went to the capital to bomb the Qing Prince Regent, but the plot failed, and he was arrested by detectives. Su, Prince of Min, the Minister of Civil Affairs, interrogated Wang in his department. Wang took up his pen and wrote straight away more than three thousand words. The gist of his confession covered ancient and modern times, spanning Europe and America. Prince Su was convinced by his arguments and requested from the Qing Prince Regent that he be spared the death penalty and sentenced to perpetual imprisonment instead. The case was settled and sent to the Ministry of Justice. Tingjie, the Minister of Justice, was angered by the Ministry of Civil Affairs encroaching on his authority and planned to mistreat Wang to vent his anger, wanting to put him in a dark prison cell. Su heard of this and was displeased. He even took out two hundred taels of silver, wrote more than ten letters, and ordered them to be sent to the Ministry of Justice to be given to Wang as a gesture. Tingjie was stubborn and jealous and, upon hearing this, became even more furious and ordered the gifts to be returned to Su. Su reported this to the Qing Prince Regent, who rebuked Tingjie, and Tingjie reluctantly gave up. Wang, therefore, spent his days in the Ministry of Justice reading books to pass the time.</p>
<p>In the autumn of the Xinhai year (1911), in the ninth month, the revolutionary army gained great momentum, and the Prince Regent was forced to pardon party members in the hope of averting disaster. On the 16th day of the month, an imperial decree was issued pardoning Wang and two others, and Zhang Mingqi was appointed to carry out the order. After Mr. Wang was released from prison, someone asked about his condition. Mr. Wang was very ill and had been silent for a long time, but he then recounted the circumstances of his time in prison. He said: "Since entering prison, I was immediately fitted with an iron cangue on my neck, which was very heavy and more than a scholar could bear. Each day, I was given only a bowl of thin congee and a piece of coarse bread. I could not even pick it up with my hands but had to eat it directly from the cangue. On this particular day, a guard suddenly burst into the room. I was in a daze, and unexpectedly, he removed the iron cangue from my neck and the iron chains from my hands, and hustled me out. My eyes were blurred, and I did not know where I was going, thinking that I was surely going to be killed. After a long time, I was taken to a warehouse, which turned out to be the Tai'an Warehouse in Gui Ma Shi. I was even more confused, wondering if I was going to be killed in the warehouse. The guard took me to a room and handed me my luggage (which had been sealed when I was arrested), along with a hundred taels of silver, saying that it had been sent by my family earlier, and eagerly asked me for a reward. I was surprised and said, "What reward should I give?" The guard told me, "You have been pardoned and released from prison." He showed me several copies of the newspaper for that day, and I became even more suspicious and then fell into a confused sleep. Now, I am still suffering from numbness all over my body. Although I read newspapers all day long, which record the wars in the southeastern provinces, I still suspect that they are not accurate, thinking that I have only been in prison for a year. Has our nation progressed so quickly?" When asked about his political views, he remained silent and refused to say a word. (Recorded from "A Record of the Deeds of Mr. Wang Jingwei" compiled by Zhang Jiangcai.)</p>
