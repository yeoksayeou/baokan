<h3>環繞雷伊泰一帶　陸海空立體激戰　菲兩地擊落敵機四十六架</h3>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　敵美在雷伊泰島登陸以來，迄今已歷一月，環繞該島一帶之陸海空立體戰鬥，日益熾烈，刻正達於極點。該島形勢最重要之地區爲瓦蓄，該地有兩道陣綫圍護，一自奧爾莫克至比那莫波安，一自卡里加拉經哈羅及達卡密至寗羅英，刻環繞該高地一帶，日軍與敵軍正在　蒼之原始森林中，展開激烈之白刃戰。敵軍哺登陸以來，以騎兵第一師自塔克羅班向卡里加拉進攻，主力之第二十四師，則由卡里加拉更向西進，越過加坡坎，通過海岸地帶之險峻山脈，到道比那莫波安及瑪那卡塞納斯附近，有自該方面南下一帶，決定雷伊泰島命運之勢，但日軍新銳部隊在里蒙方面巳完備迎擊態勢，突起圍攻敵之先鋒部隊，而將其殲滅。嗣後該方面日軍愈益壓迫敵軍，繼續北進，十一日正自瑪那卡塞納斯南方高地作俯下之猛攻敵軍，另一方面日軍有力部隊則正自某高地向卡里加拉平原及加坡坎進攻，結果進至比那莫波安附近之美第二十四軍，退路全被切斷，無可奈何，只得以三千噸級船舶二三襲，自卑里加拉方面接濟少許必需物資，且更使哈羅方面之重砲陣地，向里蒙集中轟擊，力謀救出該第二十四師。又該中央高地東斜面地帶，自卡羅經達卡密至寗羅英一帶之日軍死守堅固，並自高山陣地將敵軍之攻擊完全擊退，對達卡密及寗羅英方面之敵軍陣地連續加以猛襲，使敵軍集中大兵於雷伊泰島之高地，即完全落於日軍掌握之中，故敵第二十四師刻已瀕末路。</p>
<p>馬尼刺十六日中央社電　十四日曾有敵機來襲馬尼刺，邀戰戰果，據事後調查，陸上砲火擊落敵機二十四架，擊毀十三架，於空戰中擊落其六架。又是日於克拉克機塲所收戰果，計擊落二架，擊毀一架，總計兩地戰果，共達四十六架之多。</p>
<h3>菲島戰局中心　爭奪制空權　陸軍攻防戰同爲點</h3>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　環繞菲律賓羣島之日美決戰，日趨劇烈，雷伊泰島方面，已有敵軍五師登陸，十二日以來，更增强兵力約兩師團，日軍新銳亦已逐次加入戰綫，今已開始開戰以來最大之決戰，他方敵軍更於菲律賓近海收編踐存機動部隊，前來蠢動，對此，日方陸軍機特別攻擊隊加以猛攻，予以重創，雙方之陸海空戰愈益激烈，菲律賓羣島之戰局，實爲日本國運之關頭，現下形成菲律賓羣島戰局之中心，爲雷伊泰島之攻防戰，其成果如何，實可決定今後戰局之歸趨，敵軍對菲律賓中部之一小島雷伊泰，竟傾注主力大軍，查其意圖在早日制壓雷伊泰島，於菲律賓中部建設强力軍事基地·敵軍依此可使新幾內亞之麥克沃塞麾下之空軍前進，一舉而使全菲律賓在美空軍勢力圈內，與殘存機動部隊之海上空軍勢力合而爲一，掌握菲律賓之制空權，以期有利於戰局，因此敵軍首謀獲取全菲律賓與雷伊泰島之制空權，於空軍勢力掩護下，謀增援兵力，驅使陸地兵力前進，而中心問題爲制空權之爭奪戰，雷伊泰島之攻防戰，雙方均以制空權之爭奪及陸軍之攻防戰二點爲重點二日下日美正呈激戰狀態。</p>
<h3>日陸上部隊長　訓示全體將士</h3>
<p>馬尼刺十六日中央社電　雷伊泰島日軍陣地，在該方面日夜進行肉搏作戰，衝擊敵陣後，予敵以重大威脅，其士氣至爲振奮，此不使使攻勢企岡悉被折挫，且可使日軍大反擊態勢，得以着着整備。至於雷伊泰島日陸上部隊，其全體將七如何努力，如何決意作戰，某部隊長所子部下之訓示中，即可窺知其大概，其訓示如次：（一）吾人係一肩負日本帝國命運之決戰戰士。（二）攻勢發動之神機今已到來，吾人　前邁進，必獲勝利。（三）陸上之勝利如不能獲得，則無以言海空之勝利。（四）吾人如不能奪回雷伊泰島，則吾人雖死不回。（五）吾人已決死進行肉搏拼撞作戰。</p>
<h3>滇緬區指揮權　劃分爲兩部</h3>
<p>里斯本十六日中央社電　史蒂維爾去職後，滇緬地區之美軍指揮區域，已被分爲中國及印緬兩部，因此渝軍當局之指揮權與其範圍已成反軸心國之話題。渝方發言人張平羣十五日會見記者團時曾宣稱，蔣氏係中國越南及泰國各戰區反軸心軍之最高司令官。渝外交部次長吳國楨，對記者團之特戈爾法國已同意置越南於此指揮範圍內之質問，則力言　此指揮揮　　於反軸心軍之聞　　完全一致」。然而就任中國戰域美軍司令官之威得米雅，曾於七日言明，「越南編入中國戰域，泰國縕入東南亞洲軍司令部擔當區域之內，」此實與渝方之所言完全相遠。</p>
<h3>實部負責人　談抑平物價</h3>
<p>南京十六日中央社電　邇來物價瘋狂在暴漲，令人咋舌。當局對此極爲注意，爲力謀有效辦法，以安民生計，實業部及京市經濟局方面，均於最近派員赴上海，與滬上各有關方面聯絡磋商，聞獲得相當具體辦法。記者爲明瞭當局對物價之合理措施辦法，特趨訪實業部管理物價負責人，據稱此次赴滬與滬經濟局，及各有關方面商討結果，決定由物資各統制委員會，切實調查民生日用品之農產品生產價格，與工業品廠盤之確實數字，由各統制委員會，儘量提出參考資料與實業部，再由該部審核後轉交各地物價評議主管機關，作爲評定物價之參考以收抑平之效。聞此項辦法，刻當局已積極推動，準備最近期間，付諸實施，以期便評定物價，更趨合理化，及能早日制止物價之暴漲，而安民生云</p>
<h3>日末次大將談　太平洋戰局　神風隊表現武士精神</h3>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　日末次信正海軍大將，頃發表談話，大意謂：所謂「神風」自非無由，最近常謂之「衝攻」，實即日本武士道之至高精神，然神風隊由決死隊一躍而爲必死隊者，實爲歷史上空前所未有。決死隊者，古今東西雖不乏其例，然我必死隊實爲日本精神之顯現，絕非外國人所能理解者。現下舉國之必勝信念愈益鞏固，戰局實極重大，同時戰局以菲律賓作戰爲中心，即將予以轉換爲第一太平洋羣島之攻防戰與菲律賓島之攻防戰，兩者在補給之難易，地形之不同，機動餘地之有無等點，完全不同。過去之太平洋攻防作戰，敵方之補給極其困難，反之，菲律賓羣島乃屬設備森嚴之大島，最易補給，可使機動部隊作充分之活動，故陸海力補給錢愈益伸長，戰力之消耗亦與日激增。是以敵軍愈行前進，則此困難愈形增加，故從此敵軍決不能再作繼續抵抗，此種事實，敵方無論如何宣傳，亦無濟於事。</p>
<h3>納爾遜抵渝</h3>
<p>里斯本十六日中央社電　據重慶電稱：前美國戰時生產局長納爾遜，十六日經由莫斯科行抵重慶。</p>
<p>日軍攻佔廣西宜山</p>
<p>宜山城內十六日中央社電　日軍快速部隊，在宜山西北山岳地帶圍攻渝軍，予以潰滅打擊後，復繼續前進。十四日上午九時三十分，突入宜山城內，到處掃蕩渝軍，是日上午十時三十分，完全佔領宜山城。</p>
<h3>兩新聞協會　互勉努力</h3>
<p>南京十六日中央社電　去年十一月十七日，大東亞記考夭會於日本東京開會。到中·日·滿·泰。菲。緬及爪哇·西里伯·等各地新聞代表八十餘人，會期三日，曾獲極大成果。當時并經決定組織大東亞新聞協議會，以爲大東亞新聞界大同團結之中樞，迄今適屆週年，我國中國新聞協會，接該會理事長田中都吉氏紀念祝電，當即覆電致意，并互勉努力，茲誌兩電原文如次；（大東亞新聞協議會理事長祝電）中國新聞協會會長李思浩，副會長郭秀峯。管翼賢·陳彬龢·閣下賜鑒：當此敵美反攻雖極頑强，而日軍將士仍勇鬥善戰，屢建歷史所未有此偉勳之時，担負思想戰重責之吾等，回憶一年前之召開大會，益感有加强團結大東亞新聞界力量之必工，俾磨礪摧擊英美之筆陣，以期亞洲之解放與興隆。茲當大會週年之時，余謹以大東亞新開協議會之名義，謹祝同志各位之努力奮鬥，而希求再度相會之日近。大東亞新聞協機會理事長田中都吉。（中國新聞協會會長覆電）大東亞新聞協議會理事長田中都吉閣下，盟邦前綫忠勇將士，爲大東亞民族解放，在西南太平洋海面一舉擊毀敵美頑强之反攻，收獲赫赫戰果。適當大東亞新聞協議會成立周年之今日，我全東亞第四戰綫之成立，負思想戰重責，益當加强團結，發揮總力，以擊破敵方荒　宣傳，而期大東亞戰爭之完遂。奉讀來電，深有同感，謹向盟邦諸同志之努力奮鬥，表示莫大之敬意，仍祈不吝敎益，予中國新開界以協力以指導，謹此電復，并祝健康。中國新聞協會會長李思浩·副會長郭秀峯·管翼賢·陳彬龢。</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>重慶之命運</h3>
<p>蔣介石著過一本「中國之命運」，他的幻想，很美麗地描在這本書裏，發表之後，沒有收到他所希望的反應，相反的受到美國與論的指摘，更遭盡了共產黨人們的冷駡熟嘲。現在蔣介石的「中國之命運」所寄托的重慶，由於桂林、柳州的被盟軍佔領，直接受到嚴重的威脅。不久的將來，要受到最後的決定。它的命運，是爲每個中國人所深切注意的吧？</p>
<p>中日事變，拖戰了八年之久。某些人的意識中，對重慶寄予莫大的期望，甚至非常相信蔣的說法：「武漢失陷之前爲防禦階段，武漢撤退之後則進入反攻階段」，重慶的拖戰力量，會一天强大一天。事實的答覆，太殘酷了。因爲重慶的統治者，沒有看淸從武漢撤退後至今年四月中原大戰前夜止的五年中的形勢，就是日本政府在佔領武漢後，對華政策，在策略上不以武力爲解決中日事燮的方針，在政治途徑上希望重慶覺悟而走到全面和平。祗在不得已的情形下而執行局部的軍事行動，其主要作用，是在保衛和平區，擊退渝共的進擾，所以或則適可而止，或則於完成任務後退回原防，如幾次佔領長沙，幾次退出。重慶的統治者，竟忽略了這一點，在不光榮的勝利中，造成了錯覺，眞認爲日本在軍事上無再向前進攻的力量了，種下了重慶悲慘運的根。</p>
<p>因此，迷戀於「抗戰勝利」，「民族英雄」幻想中的重慶統治者們，不惜犧牲，把中國的人力物力，供敵美奴役，土地供蹂躪。以中國大陸爲基地，擾亂和平區與日本本土。處於這種形勢之下，日軍不能坐視敵美勢力在華擴張，只有以軍事力量，在中國大陸上擊滅英美，毀滅重慶拖戰的夢想。日本政府特別發表聲明，說明這次作戰目的，促醒重慶的覺悟。但是，重慶執抝於拖戰，七個月來，失去河南省之大半，湖南省之全城及廣西之重要據點——桂林，柳州。費去二年歲月，幾十萬人民的血汗所築成的西南地區航空要塞，短時間內被摧毀。百萬渝軍，在南北戰塲上，損失殆半。衡陽經四十日苦戰始放棄，今爲防衛重慶之牙城——挂林，雖下令死守，戰至一兵一卒，然士不用命，僅經四十小時之抵抗，即吿投降，已至民無戰意，士無國志，六年前的敗戰，於今更甚</p>
<p>桂林柳州佔領後，重慶政權的統治力量，非常薄弱。全國鐵道，百分之九十四在盟軍掌握中，差不多無鐵道綫可言。東南半壁，西南幾省，完全與重慶割絕，未佔領地區，名義上雖隸於重慶，事實上是支離破碎，各行其道。戰爭資源最富饒的湖南江西，今已無法利用。貴洲　雲南，四川，有即刻變爲戰塲的可能，比較安全而完整的省份，祇剩陝甘寗靑等省，但是，這些省份，不是貧瘠邊遠，便爲共黨所盤踞。六年飾的敗戰，還有重慶可退。如果渝蔣不考慮今天的形勢，作聰明的打算，仍是繼續拖戰，那末，日軍可能以重慶爲目標，於中國大陸上澈底擊滅英美勢力。那時，重慶將退到何處去呢？</p>
<p>戰爭的失敗，不僅是造成了政治地位的動搖，而且失去了國際間的威望。去年開羅會議時，蔣以四大强國領袖之一被邀出席，曾幾何時，美國與論界，竟以南斯拉夫的米海羅維區來相議了。以戰爭失利爲口實，竟致干涉內政，現在，中共的代表周恩來，由美國陸軍機護送抵重慶，在美國的支持下，進行「聯合民主政府」的談判。相信不會有什麼結果，但是我們更相信渝蔣的拖戰，不是希望「一個政府」變成「聯合民主政府」，「一個主義」之中可以加入一個「共產主義」，「一個領袖」之外有一個「毛澤東」。</p>
<p>以前所擁護所贊頌的人們，現在都懷着敵意，等候機會，給予重慶致命的打擊。惟有日本，早已聲明不以重慶爲敵，充溢着亞細亞人的友情，歡迎重慶回到亞細亞人的懷抱裏來。重慶的命運，到了須工重慶的人士勇敢果斷的決定時候了。</p>
<h3>廣西戰綫日軍自柳州西進　宜山附近刻正激戰中</h3>
<p>華南前綫十六日中央社電　廣西戰綫日軍，刻急追向柳州西方地區後退之渝軍。十四日黃昏，業已到達柳州西方約六十公里之南鄉，將渝軍退路完全遮斷。一方自柳州西方地區南下之一部日軍，十四日渡過武江北上之日軍，於柳州西南方約四十公里之日見村附近，取得連絡。因此渝第四十六軍及六十四軍主力，已究全置於包圍之下。</p>
<p>廣西前綫十六日中央社電　日軍於十日攻陷柳州後，其迅速部隊，即賡續追向貴州方面遁走之渝軍，刻正於宜山附近激戰中。</p>
<p>華南前綫日軍某基地十六日中央社電　柳州陷落後，渝軍在該地東北方地區，已失其指揮系統，而陷於混亂狀態。當此之時，日軍爲殲滅該地渝軍，除壓縮對渝軍之包圍等外，並急追逃往柳州西南地區之渝六十四軍，及第四十六軍之一部，於十三日開抵流山墟（柳州西方約四十公里）及里高墟一帶，予渝軍以殲滅打擊。</p>

<h3>京行瑣記</h3>
<p>— 呂震</p>
<p>最近筆者曾到南京去走了一次，因爲時期旣短，瑣事又緊，所以只留得些膚淺的印象。茲將見聞所得，略記於後：</p>
<p>市容一瞥</p>
<p>今日的南京，雖然山河依舊，然而市容凋殘，則已隱然可見。以市內交通而言，公共汽車只剩下了從下關到夫子廟一帶的一路，並且班次減少，因之乘客搭乘，必須長久等待。此外代步的，除人力車外，最多的是公共馬車。這些馬車，行程有定，例如停在夫子廟的，等到搭客數額已滿七，八人時，就開車出發，在半路上隨地可以搭客，也隨地可以下車，至新街口爲終站，無論遠近，每人收費二十元。市政府本規定每嗣馬車只准搭客七人，但在事實上，搭客十一·二人的也不在少。我曾搭乘這一輛馬車，駕馳者是兩個年僅十五·六歲的孩子，因爲馬行甚綏，於是屢施鞭撻，但結果那匹馬索性佇立不進，另一個孩子不得不下車拉着馬跑。大槪是爲了馬已老，或食糧不足，因此那匹馬就無力奔跑了。而爲了謀生，學齡的兒童也忙着擔任起成人的工作了。</p>
<p>在事變以前，南京經朝野建設，市况漸盛，已有現代化的景象。迨經事變，突遭浩刧，破毀甚鉅，至國府還都以後，住民　集，一時殊有復興之象。但至今日，復現衰落之狀。市街之間，仍有不少斷垣殘屋，穿插其間，未加修理。夫子廟一帶本是熱鬧之區，但如今毀壞了的夫子廟，在還都時搭起的蓆蓋木棚，亦已多數拆毀，只餘寥寥的幾個小攤頭擺在那裏做着小生意。附近一帶街道，因久失修，更其高低不平，並且沿途兩旁堆積着磚石，無人淸理。秦淮河新經放水，所以河水還高，但仍然汚綠，這一帶市民便在這汚綠的水中洗衣淘米。所謂畫舫，艙棚衰陋，猶如丟在岸邊的殘骸。市內最繁盛的市塲，比上海靜安寺梵皇渡路口的百樂商塲，不過聊勝一籌。著名全國的京緞，事實上多數是從杭州運去的，在南京並無織造的工廠。在高生活的壓迫麼，街道上難得見到幾個服裝整齊的行人，所以奢華之風倒不如上海之盛。物資的缺乏，尤較上海爲　，例如猪肉，價格儘管高漲，可是一早便就賣完。我有一位朋友，住宅距離鬧市較遠，他的娘姨往往在早上走到市塲，肉早售罄，因此他約我吃飯，直到已經買到肉後才敢開口。許多店家，本就是門面狹小，設備簡陋，而於今尤甚。南京是一個中國的都市，不像上海是一個世界的都市，所以南京的一般人，對於國際大局，並不顯出熱烈的關心，而這幾天恰好又逢到在主席逝世，所以一般人尤其是公務員，比較注意於今後國府人事調整的消息。</p>
<p>公務員的生活</p>
<p>因爲南京是首都，所以成了一個政治中心，而公務員亦特多。他們的薪給，雖然也跟着物價指數表的高漲，而在間歇地加成甚至加倍，但好像烏龜追自兎，是愈追愈落後。</p>
<p>目前的一個普通公務員，如科長科員之類，薪金不過五，六千元，在政府方面，雖然定有俸米六斗發給，然而時已十一月，所吃的還是七月份的傣米，而且十月份起又將以現款折價，據說僅以三千元一担計算，而南京的黑市米價則爲每石七，八千元（南京食米較爲粗劣，價格亦較上海爲低），這計算，豈非又使公務員受到一筆損失？</p>
<p>大部分的公務員都是有家眷的，假定以一個公務員負担三人的生活計算，那末他的支出非有一萬五千元莫辦，可是薪金五六千元，加上傣米折價一干八百元，能否收支相抵呢。而且肚子要飽，身體不要暖嗎？兩只腿可以忍受勞役，穿了底的鞋襪難這不要換嗎？</p>
<p>不過，儘管做公務員的是吃不飽，穿不暖，儘管一部份的公務負改了行，但是仍有許多人在鑽營謀差使，於是在機關中仍不免有互相排擠的情事。</p>
<p>高級公務員的收入是比較多些，做司長的收入，迎傣在內，約共三萬元；次長約共五萬元，部畏約共六七萬元。但他們的支出也比較大，闔家的生活也是難於支撑。我有一個朋友是做司長的，另一個是做次長的，他們都說預備下野，或回鄉去吃老米飯；或去別謀生路。因爲他們不但生活不安定，並且做事製府，而指揮下級公務員，也不容易。那些下級公務員，多數在飢餓綫上掙扎，自然　有心緒去辦公，倘有臨時要公辦理，總得想法得些好處，否則做事就不大起勁了</p>
<p>不過，這次南京召開的文學者會議，辦事者已經盡了最大的力量。尤其是章克和龔持平兩先生，終日繁忙，這種任勞任怨的精神，在今日中國的政界是很難得的；大槪他們兩位都是文化人出身，所以如此勇於負責的吧。</p>
<p>最高學府</p>
<p>被稱爲最高學府的國立中央大學，自前校長樊仲雲先生辭職後，一年之中，三易其長。當敎育部長李聖五先生兼任時代，將處理校務大權，分付總務敎務兩長，在學生管理上似取英美式放任主義的傾向，並無實效可收，因乃中途辭職。陳柱尊氏以學術界名流接長校務，無奈辦校缺乏總力，而一班學生自經鬧過學潮以後，氣燄一時不易收斂，於是敎職員們也就灰心下來，辭職離校者日多。本春政府任命陳昌祖先生繼長中大，他擬以治軍的精神來治校，故於一星期中，學生俯首，敎職員貼服。可是學校與軍隊畢竟性質不同，把學生當做士兵對付，企圖以威使之　服，所不謀以德使之心服，其敎育效果如何，實爲疑問，而敎授們有相繼引去者則不乏人，並且傳聞在本學期中，竟發生入學試題的出賣珍貴書籍的盜售等等事件，此說若果屬實，那眞是淸高敎育界中的汚點了。最近爲了食米變質，據說學生在飯廳中把碗打得粉碎，還把米穀各半的「衛生飯」陳列禮堂請校長「便飯」。這次飯堂風潮的結果，學校當局開革庶務課負責人員，答應今後供給純凈白米，終算宣吿解決。又據一位靑少年團中人所吿，聞該校收費，去年每學期每生爲三千元左右，而本學期則漲至一萬三千元左右，有些貧苦學生，因爲無力負担而致輟學，或竟受鼓動而他往者，殊不爲少。現在的學生，與兵士同爲戲院方面所畏懼的人物，因爲常有結隊前往，不買票看白戲，倘經干涉，就大起糾紛。</p>

<h3>Fierce Three-Dimensional Battles Around Leyte Island: 46 Enemy Planes Shot Down in Two Locations in the Philippines</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - It has been a month since the enemy Americans landed on Leyte Island. The three-dimensional battles by land, sea, and air around the island are becoming increasingly fierce and are now reaching their climax. The most important area on the island is Wa-xu, which is protected by two lines of defense: one from Ormoc to Binamopoan, and the other from Carigara via Haro and Dakami to Ningloing. Around this highland, Japanese and enemy forces are engaged in fierce hand-to-hand combat in the ancient virgin forests. Since landing, the enemy's 1st Cavalry Division has advanced from Tacloban towards Carigara, while the main force, the 24th Division, has advanced further west from Carigara, crossed Singapore-kan, passed through the treacherous mountain ranges of the coastal area, and reached the vicinity of Dobinamopoan and Manakasenas. From this direction, they are in a position to determine the fate of Leyte Island. However, new Japanese troops have completed their defensive posture in the Limon area and launched a surprise attack on the enemy's vanguard, annihilating them. Subsequently, the Japanese forces in that area increasingly pressured the enemy and continued to advance north. On the 11th, they launched a fierce attack from the highlands south of Manakasenas. On the other hand, powerful Japanese forces are advancing from a certain highland towards the Carigara Plain and Singapore-kan. As a result, the enemy's 24th Corps, which had advanced to the vicinity of Binamopoan, had its retreat completely cut off. Helpless, it could only use two or three 3,000-ton ships to resupply a small amount of necessary supplies from the Beligala area, and even concentrate the heavy artillery positions in the Haro area to bombard Limon in an effort to rescue the 24th Division. Furthermore, the Japanese forces in the eastern slope area of the central highlands, from Carolo via Dakami to Ningloing, are holding firm and completely repelling the enemy's attacks from the mountain positions, continuously launching fierce attacks on the enemy positions in the Dakami and Ningloing areas. This has forced the enemy to concentrate a large force on the highlands of Leyte Island, which are completely under Japanese control. Therefore, the enemy's 24th Division is now on the verge of collapse.</p>
<p>Manila, 16th (Central News Agency) - Enemy planes attacked Manila on the 14th. According to a subsequent investigation of the results of the battle, ground artillery shot down 24 enemy planes and destroyed 13, while six were shot down in air combat. Furthermore, the results achieved at Clark Airfield on the same day included two shot down and one destroyed, bringing the total results for both locations to as many as 46.</p>
<h3>The Center of the Philippine Battle: Contending for Air Supremacy, Both Army Offense and Defense are Key Points</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - The decisive battle between Japan and the United States around the Philippine Islands is intensifying. On the Leyte Island front, five enemy divisions have landed, and since the 12th, they have further reinforced their forces by about two divisions. New Japanese troops have also gradually joined the battle lines, and the largest decisive battle since the start of the war has now begun. Elsewhere, enemy forces are consolidating the surviving mobile units in the waters near the Philippines and making threatening moves. In response, Japanese army air special attack units are launching fierce attacks, inflicting heavy damage. The land, sea, and air battles between the two sides are becoming increasingly fierce. The battle situation in the Philippine Islands is truly at a crucial juncture for Japan's national destiny. The current center of the Philippine Islands battle situation is the offensive and defensive battle on Leyte Island. The outcome of this battle will determine the future course of the war. The enemy has poured its main force into Leyte, a small island in the central Philippines. Their intention is to quickly seize Leyte Island and build a strong military base in the central Philippines. From this base, the enemy can advance the air force under Mac沃塞 in New Guinea and bring the entire Philippines within the sphere of US air power in one fell swoop, combining it with the maritime air power of the surviving mobile units to seize air supremacy over the Philippines, in order to favor the war situation. Therefore, the enemy is first plotting to gain air supremacy over the entire Philippines and Leyte Island, and under the cover of air power, they are planning to reinforce their forces and advance their land forces. The central issue is the battle for air supremacy. The offensive and defensive battle on Leyte Island focuses on the battle for air supremacy and the land army's offensive and defensive battles. Japan and the United States are currently engaged in fierce fighting.</p>
<h3>Commander of Japanese Ground Forces Instructs All Officers and Soldiers</h3>
<p>Manila, 16th (Central News Agency) - Japanese army positions on Leyte Island are engaged in hand-to-hand combat day and night, launching attacks on enemy positions and posing a major threat to the enemy. Their morale is extremely high. This not only thwarts all enemy offensive attempts but also allows the Japanese army to gradually prepare for a major counterattack. As for how the Japanese ground forces on Leyte Island are striving and what their determination is for the battle, we can get a glimpse from the instructions given to his subordinates by a certain commander. The instructions are as follows: (1) We are decisive warriors shouldering the fate of the Japanese Empire. (2) The divine opportunity to launch an offensive has now arrived. We will advance and surely achieve victory. (3) Without victory on land, there can be no talk of victory at sea or in the air. (4) If we cannot retake Leyte Island, we will not return even in death. (5) We are resolved to engage in desperate hand-to-hand combat.</p>
<h3>Command of the Yunnan-Burma Area Divided into Two Parts</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 16th (Central News Agency) - After Stilwell's departure, the US military command area in the Yunnan-Burma region has been divided into two parts: China and India-Burma. Therefore, the command authority and scope of the Chongqing military authorities have become a topic for the anti-Axis powers. Chongqing spokesman Zhang Pingqun claimed when meeting with a group of reporters on the 15th that Chiang Kai-shek is the supreme commander of the anti-Axis forces in the war zones of China, Vietnam, and Thailand. When asked by a group of reporters whether French Togo had agreed to place Vietnam within this command area, Chongqing Deputy Foreign Minister Wu Guozhen vigorously stated that "this command is entirely consistent with the anti-Axis forces." However, Wedemeyer, who took office as the US military commander in the China theater, stated on the 7th that "Vietnam is incorporated into the China theater, and Thailand is incorporated into the area of responsibility of the Southeast Asia Command," which is completely different from what Chongqing has said.</p>
<h3>Person in Charge of the Ministry of Industry Talks About Suppressing Prices</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency) - The recent rampant inflation is shocking. The authorities are paying close attention to this and are striving to find effective ways to ensure the people's livelihood. The Ministry of Industry and the Beijing Economic Bureau have recently sent personnel to Shanghai to contact and consult with various relevant parties in Shanghai, and it is reported that they have obtained quite concrete measures. In order to understand the authorities' rational measures for prices, this reporter specifically visited the person in charge of price management at the Ministry of Industry. According to him, the result of this trip to Shanghai to discuss with the Shanghai Economic Bureau and various relevant parties is that the various materials control committees will conduct a thorough investigation of the production prices of agricultural products for daily necessities and the actual figures for industrial products from factories. The various control committees will provide as much reference material as possible to the Ministry of Industry, which will then review it and forward it to the local price review authorities as a reference for price evaluation, in order to achieve the effect of suppressing prices. It is reported that the authorities are actively promoting this measure and preparing to implement it in the near future, in order to make price evaluation more rational and to stop the rampant inflation as soon as possible and ensure the people's livelihood.</p>
<h3>Japanese General Suetsugu Talks About the Pacific War Situation: Kamikaze Corps Demonstrates the Spirit of Bushido</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Admiral Nobumasa Suetsugu recently issued a statement, the gist of which is: The so-called "Kamikaze" is not without reason. Recently, it has often been called "shock attack," which is the highest spirit of Japanese Bushido. However, the fact that the Kamikaze Corps has leaped from a suicide squad to a certain-death squad is unprecedented in history. Although there are many examples of suicide squads throughout history, both ancient and modern, the speaker's certain-death squad is truly a manifestation of the Japanese spirit, which foreigners cannot understand. At present, the nation's belief in certain victory is becoming increasingly solid. The war situation is extremely important. At the same time, the war situation, with the Philippines operation as its center, will soon be transformed into the offensive and defensive battle of the First Pacific Islands and the offensive and defensive battle of the Philippine Islands. The two are completely different in terms of the ease of supply, the difference in terrain, and the presence or absence of room for maneuver. In past Pacific offensive and defensive operations, the enemy's supply was extremely difficult. On the contrary, the Philippine Islands are large islands with heavily defended installations, making them easiest to supply and allowing mobile units to operate fully. Therefore, the supply lines for land and sea are becoming increasingly long, and the consumption of combat power is also increasing day by day. Therefore, the further the enemy advances, the more this difficulty increases. Therefore, from now on, the enemy will never be able to continue to resist. No matter how the enemy publicizes this fact, it will be of no avail.</p>
<h3>Nelson Arrives in Chongqing</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to a Chongqing dispatch: Nelson, former head of the US War Production Board, arrived in Chongqing on the 16th via Moscow.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Capture Yishan in Guangxi</p>
<p>Yishan City, 16th (Central News Agency) - Japanese rapid deployment troops besieged the Chongqing troops in the mountainous area northwest of Yishan, inflicting a crushing blow on them, and then continued to advance. At 9:30 a.m. on the 14th, they broke into Yishan City and swept through the city, and at 10:30 a.m. on the same day, they completely occupied Yishan City.</p>
<h3>Two News Associations Encourage Each Other to Work Hard</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency) - On November 17th of last year, the Greater East Asia Journalists Association held a meeting in Tokyo, Japan. More than 80 news representatives from China, Japan, Manchuria, Thailand, the Philippines, Burma, and Java, Celebes, and other places attended the meeting, which lasted for three days and achieved great results. At that time, it was also decided to organize the Greater East Asia News Council as the central hub for the great unity and solidarity of the Greater East Asia news community. Today marks the anniversary of this decision. The Chinese News Association of our country received a commemorative congratulatory telegram from Mr. Tanaka Tokichi, chairman of the association, and immediately replied to express its gratitude and encourage each other to work hard. The original text of the two telegrams is as follows: (Congratulatory Telegram from the Chairman of the Greater East Asia News Council) To Mr. Li Sihao, President of the Chinese News Association, and Vice Presidents Guo Xiufeng, Guan Yixian, and Chen Binhe: At this time, when the enemy Americans' counterattack is extremely stubborn, but the Japanese soldiers are still fighting bravely and repeatedly establishing unprecedented great achievements, we who bear the heavy responsibility of ideological warfare feel even more the necessity of strengthening the power of the Greater East Asia news community, so as to hone our pens to strike down the British and Americans, in order to achieve the liberation and prosperity of Asia. On the occasion of the anniversary of the conference, I, on behalf of the Greater East Asia News Association, respectfully wish all comrades efforts and struggles, and hope that the day of our reunion will be near. Chairman of the Greater East Asia News Association, Tanaka Tokichi. (Reply Telegram from the President of the Chinese News Association) To His Excellency Tanaka Tokichi, Chairman of the Greater East Asia News Council: Loyal and brave soldiers on the front lines of our allied countries are liberating the Greater East Asia peoples and have dealt a heavy blow to the stubborn counterattack of the enemy Americans on the Southwest Pacific, reaping glorious victories. On the occasion of the anniversary of the establishment of the Greater East Asia News Council today, the establishment of the Fourth War Front in our entire East Asia, which bears the heavy responsibility of ideological warfare, should further strengthen unity and exert total force to break through the enemy's absurd propaganda and achieve the completion of the Greater East Asia War. I have read your telegram and deeply agree. I would like to express my utmost respect to the efforts and struggles of the comrades in our allied countries. I still hope that you will not hesitate to instruct us and provide guidance to the Chinese new opening community. This is my reply and I wish you good health. President of the Chinese News Association, Li Sihao, Vice Presidents Guo Xiufeng, Guan Yixian, and Chen Binhe.</p>
<h3>Chairman Wang's Instructions</h3>
<p>(1) We believe that comprehensive peace will be achieved sooner or later, and the Greater East Asia War will be completed sooner or later.</p>
<p>(2) Be thrifty in peacetime to enrich the country, and sacrifice oneself in times of difficulty to save the country.</p>
<p>(3) Those who are selfish and forget the public interest, step aside. Those who are selfless and forget their own interests, come and work together.</p>
<p>(4) Individuals should contribute much to the country and enjoy little.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Fate of Chongqing</h3>
<p>Chiang Kai-shek wrote a book entitled "China's Destiny," in which he beautifully described his fantasies. After its publication, it did not receive the reaction he had hoped for. On the contrary, it was criticized by American public opinion and ridiculed by the Communists. Now, Chongqing, the city on which Chiang Kai-shek's "China's Destiny" is pinned, is directly and severely threatened by the Allied forces' occupation of Guilin and Liuzhou. In the near future, it will face a final decision. Its fate is a matter of deep concern to every Chinese person, isn't it?</p>
<p>The Sino-Japanese War has dragged on for eight years. Some people have placed great expectations on Chongqing, and even firmly believe in Chiang's statement: "Before the fall of Wuhan, it was the defensive stage, and after the retreat from Wuhan, it entered the counter-offensive stage." Chongqing's dragging-on power would become stronger day by day. The actual answer is too cruel. Because the rulers of Chongqing did not see clearly the situation in the five years from the retreat from Wuhan to the eve of the Central Plains War in April of this year, that is, after occupying Wuhan, the Japanese government's policy towards China did not take military force as the solution to the Sino-Japanese War in terms of strategy. In terms of politics, it hoped that Chongqing would come to its senses and move towards comprehensive peace. It only carried out local military operations in unavoidable circumstances. Its main role was to protect the peace zone and repel the intrusions of the Chongqing Communists, so it either stopped at the right time or retreated to its original defense after completing its mission, such as occupying Changsha several times and withdrawing several times. The rulers of Chongqing actually ignored this point and created a misconception in an inglorious victory, truly believing that Japan no longer had the military strength to advance further, which sowed the seeds of Chongqing's tragic fate.</p>
<p>Therefore, the rulers of Chongqing, who were infatuated with the fantasies of "victory in the War of Resistance" and "national heroes," did not hesitate to sacrifice the human and material resources of China to serve the enemy Americans and allowed their land to be trampled upon. Using the Chinese mainland as a base, they disturbed the peace zone and the Japanese mainland. Under this situation, the Japanese army could not sit idly by and watch the expansion of the enemy American forces in China. It could only use military force to destroy the British and Americans on the Chinese mainland and destroy Chongqing's dream of dragging on the war. The Japanese government issued a special statement, explaining the purpose of this operation and urging Chongqing to come to its senses. However, Chongqing insisted on dragging on the war. In the past seven months, it has lost most of Henan Province, the entire city of Hunan Province, and the important stronghold of Guilin, Liuzhou in Guangxi. The air fortress in the southwest region, which took two years and the blood and sweat of hundreds of thousands of people to build, was destroyed in a short period of time. Half of the million-strong Chongqing army was lost on the north and south battlefields. Hengyang was abandoned after 40 days of hard fighting. Now, Guilin, the gateway to the defense of Chongqing, has been ordered to be defended to the death, with every soldier fighting to the last, but the soldiers did not follow orders and surrendered after only 40 hours of resistance. The people have no will to fight and the soldiers have no patriotism. The defeat six years ago is even worse today.</p>
<p>After the occupation of Guilin and Liuzhou, the ruling power of the Chongqing regime is very weak. Ninety-four percent of the country's railways are in the hands of the Allied forces, and there are almost no railway lines left. The southeast half and several southwest provinces are completely cut off from Chongqing. Although the unoccupied areas are nominally under the jurisdiction of Chongqing, in fact, they are fragmented and each goes its own way. The most resource-rich Hunan and Jiangxi provinces can no longer be used. Guizhou, Yunnan, and Sichuan may become battlefields at any moment. The relatively safe and intact provinces are only Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai, but these provinces are either barren and remote or occupied by the Communist Party. In the defeat six years ago, there was still Chongqing to retreat to. If the Chongqing Chiang regime does not consider the current situation and make smart plans, but continues to drag on the war, then the Japanese army may target Chongqing and completely destroy the British and American forces on the Chinese mainland. At that time, where will Chongqing retreat to?</p>
<p>The failure of the war not only caused the shaking of the political status but also lost international prestige. At the Cairo Conference last year, Chiang Kai-shek was invited to attend as one of the leaders of the four great powers. How long ago was that? The American public opinion community actually compared him to Mihailović in Yugoslavia. Using the failure of the war as an excuse, they even interfered in internal affairs. Now, Zhou Enlai, the representative of the CCP, has arrived in Chongqing escorted by a US military plane to conduct negotiations on a "united democratic government" with American support. We believe that there will be no results, but we believe even more that the Chongqing Chiang regime's dragging on the war is not hoping to turn "one government" into a "united democratic government," to add a "communist ideology" to "one ideology," or to have a "Mao Zedong" in addition to "one leader."</p>
<p>The people who used to support and praise them now harbor hostility and are waiting for an opportunity to deal a fatal blow to Chongqing. Only Japan has long stated that it does not regard Chongqing as an enemy, is full of Asian friendship, and welcomes Chongqing back to the embrace of the Asian people. The fate of Chongqing has reached the time when Chongqing's people must make a brave and decisive decision.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Advances Westward from Liuzhou on Guangxi Front: Fierce Fighting Currently Underway Near Yishan</h3>
<p>South China Front, 16th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese army on the Guangxi front is currently pursuing the Chongqing army that is retreating westward from Liuzhou. By dusk on the 14th, they had reached Nanxiang, about 60 kilometers west of Liuzhou, completely cutting off the Chongqing army's retreat. On the other hand, a unit of the Japanese army that advanced southward from the western area of Liuzhou and a unit of the Japanese army that crossed the Wu River northward on the 14th made contact near Riken Village, about 40 kilometers southwest of Liuzhou. Therefore, the main forces of the Chongqing 46th and 64th Armies have been completely surrounded.</p>
<p>Guangxi Front, 16th (Central News Agency) - After the Japanese army captured Liuzhou on the 10th, its rapid deployment troops immediately continued to pursue the Chongqing army that was fleeing towards Guizhou, and fierce fighting is currently underway near Yishan.</p>
<p>A Certain Japanese Base on the South China Front, 16th (Central News Agency) - After the fall of Liuzhou, the Chongqing army in the northeastern area of the city lost its command system and fell into chaos. At this time, in order to annihilate the Chongqing army in that area, in addition to compressing the encirclement of the Chongqing army, the Japanese army also quickly pursued the Chongqing 64th Army and a part of the 46th Army that were fleeing to the southwestern area of Liuzhou, arriving in the vicinity of Liushan Market (about 40 kilometers west of Liuzhou) and Ligao Market on the 13th, inflicting a crushing blow on the Chongqing army.</p>
<h3>General Hata Goes to the Front to Command</h3>

The original autopsy report will be kept by the sub-bureau, the original autopsy certificate will be given to the person collecting the body, the first copy will be sent directly to the Judicial Affairs Section, and the second copy will be sent to the Air Defense Section of the Police Defense Office. The judicial director will be responsible for the preparation of this report. The sub-bureau chief will mobilize necessary personnel to assist in the investigation and disposal of the body. (B) For unidentified bodies, if the identity of the body is unknown, it will first be sent to a designated body storage location and displayed publicly for three days for identification. If no one claims the body, it will be buried by the staff of the Pushan Villa Tongren Hall. (Note) For unidentified bodies, the date, time, and location of discovery, as well as the sub-bureau number, must be clearly indicated and attached to the body when it is sent to the body storage location.

<h3>Police Bureau Strictly Prohibits Rumors from Misleading the Public</h3>
<p>It has been found that since the American enemy planes attacked the Shanghai area on the 11th of this month, and the shocking news of the passing of Chairman Wang of the National Government on the 13th, various absurd and unfounded rumors have emerged in the streets and alleys of this city. The reason for this lies in the fact that a large number of ignorant people have been incited by the conspiracies of the British, Americans, and Chongqing, and that a segment of the intelligentsia has also failed to distinguish right from wrong, using the current situation as an opportunity to fabricate rumors without end, thereby creating panic among the people. Now, the City Police Bureau, in order to reassure and protect the people, has resolved to eradicate the source of rumors. Anyone found to be spreading rumors or disrupting public order will be severely punished without leniency. It is hoped that all citizens will understand the intentions of the authorities, not be misled by rumors, and refrain from rash actions.</p>

<h3>Nanjing Miscellanea</h3>
<p>— By Lü Zhen</p>
<p>I recently made a trip to Nanjing. Because the period was short and the matters were pressing, I only retained some superficial impressions. I will now briefly record what I saw and heard:</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the City</p>
<p>Today's Nanjing, although the mountains and rivers remain the same, the desolation of the city is already visible. In terms of urban transportation, only one bus route remains, running from Xiaguan to the Confucius Temple area, and the frequency of service has decreased, so passengers must wait a long time. In addition to rickshaws, the most common mode of transportation is public horse-drawn carriages. These carriages have fixed routes, for example, those stationed at the Confucius Temple wait until they have seven or eight passengers before departing. Passengers can board and disembark anywhere along the route, with Xinjiekou as the final destination. The fare is 20 yuan per person, regardless of distance. The municipal government originally stipulated that each carriage should only carry seven passengers, but in fact, it is not uncommon to see carriages carrying eleven or twelve passengers. I once rode in such a carriage, driven by two children aged only fifteen or sixteen. Because the horse was moving very slowly, they repeatedly whipped it, but as a result, the horse simply stood still. The other child had to get out of the carriage and pull the horse along. This was probably because the horse was old or lacked sufficient food, so it was unable to run. And in order to make a living, children of school age are busy taking on the work of adults.</p>
<p>Before the incident, Nanjing had been undergoing construction by the government and the public, and the city was gradually prospering, with a modern appearance. However, after the incident, it suffered a great catastrophe, with extensive destruction. After the return of the National Government, the residents gathered, and there was a temporary revival. But today, it has returned to a state of decline. There are still many broken walls and ruins interspersed throughout the city, which have not been repaired. The Confucius Temple area was originally a lively area, but the destroyed Confucius Temple, and the mat-covered wooden sheds that were built during the return of the capital, have mostly been demolished, leaving only a few small stalls doing small business. The nearby streets have been in disrepair for a long time, and are uneven, with piles of bricks and stones along the sides of the road, which no one clears. The Qinhuai River has just been released, so the river water is still high, but it is still a dirty green. The citizens in this area wash clothes and rice in this dirty green water. The so-called pleasure boats are dilapidated, like the remains of ships abandoned on the shore. The most prosperous market in the city is only slightly better than the Paramount shopping mall at the Jing'an Temple and Fanhwangdu Road intersection in Shanghai. The famous Nanjing brocade is, in fact, mostly transported from Hangzhou, and there are no weaving factories in Nanjing. Under the pressure of high living costs, it is rare to see pedestrians with neat clothing on the streets, so the extravagance is not as prevalent as in Shanghai. The lack of supplies is even more severe than in Shanghai, for example, pork, despite high prices, is sold out early in the morning. One of my friends lives far from the city center. His maid often goes to the market in the morning, but the meat is already sold out, so he only dared to invite me to dinner after he had already bought the meat. Many shops are already small and poorly equipped, but today they are even worse. Nanjing is a Chinese city, unlike Shanghai, which is a world city, so the general public in Nanjing does not show a keen interest in the international situation. And these days, it happened to coincide with the passing of the chairman, so the general public, especially civil servants, are paying more attention to the news of future personnel adjustments in the National Government.</p>
<p>The Lives of Civil Servants</p>
<p>Because Nanjing is the capital, it has become a political center, and there are many civil servants. Although their salaries have also increased intermittently, even doubled, following the rise in the price index, it seems that the tortoise is chasing the rabbit, and is falling further and further behind.</p>
<p>Currently, the salary of an average civil servant, such as a section chief or clerk, is only about 5,000 or 6,000 yuan. Although the government has stipulated that six dou of rice should be issued as salary, it is already November, and they are still eating the unhusked rice from July. Moreover, starting in October, it will be converted into cash, reportedly calculated at only 3,000 yuan per dan, while the black market price of rice in Nanjing is 7,000 or 8,000 yuan per stone (the rice in Nanjing is of lower quality, and the price is lower than in Shanghai). Isn't this calculation causing civil servants to suffer another loss?</p>
<p>Most civil servants have families. Assuming that a civil servant supports a family of three, then his expenses must be at least 15,000 yuan. But can a salary of 5,000 or 6,000 yuan, plus 1,800 yuan for the rice conversion, make ends meet? And does the stomach need to be filled, or does the body need to be kept warm? The legs can endure labor, but can worn-out shoes and socks not be replaced?</p>
<p>However, although civil servants are not eating enough or wearing enough, although some civil servants have changed careers, there are still many people vying for positions, so there is still inevitable infighting in the agencies.</p>
<p>The income of senior civil servants is relatively higher. The income of a department director, including the rice allowance, is about 30,000 yuan; a vice minister, about 50,000 yuan; and a minister, about 60,000 or 70,000 yuan. But their expenses are also relatively high, and it is difficult to support the family. One of my friends is a department director, and another is a vice minister. They both said they were preparing to retire, or go back to their hometown to live off their savings, or find another way to make a living. Because not only is their life unstable, but it is also difficult to do things and govern, and it is not easy to command lower-level civil servants. Most of those lower-level civil servants are struggling on the brink of starvation, so they naturally have no interest in working. If there is a temporary official matter to be handled, they must find a way to get some benefits, otherwise they will not be very enthusiastic about doing things.</p>
<p>However, the organizers of the Writers' Conference held in Nanjing this time have done their best. Especially Mr. Zhang Ke and Mr. Gong Chiping, they are busy all day long. This spirit of hard work and dedication is very rare in today's Chinese political circles; probably because they are both from a cultural background, so they are so willing to take responsibility.</p>
<p>The Highest Institution of Learning</p>
<p>The National Central University, which is called the highest institution of learning, has changed its president three times in one year since the resignation of former president Fan Zhongyun. During the time when Minister of Education Li Shengwu concurrently served as president, he delegated the authority to handle school affairs to the heads of general affairs and academic affairs. In student management, he seemed to adopt a laissez-faire approach similar to that of the United States and the United Kingdom, which had no practical effect, so he resigned halfway. Chen Zhuzun, a famous figure in the academic world, took over the presidency, but unfortunately lacked the power to run the school, and a group of students, after having caused a student strike, were not easily restrained, so the faculty and staff became discouraged, and the number of those who resigned and left the school increased. This spring, the government appointed Chen Changzu as the new president of Central University. He intended to run the school with the spirit of managing the army, so within a week, the students bowed their heads and the faculty and staff were submissive. However, schools and armies are different in nature after all. Treating students like soldiers, attempting to force them into submission with authority, and not seeking to make them obey with virtue, the educational effect is questionable. And there is no lack of professors who have resigned and left the school one after another. Furthermore, it is rumored that during this semester, there have been incidents such as the selling of entrance examination questions and the theft and sale of valuable books. If this is true, then it is a stain on the lofty educational world. Recently, due to the deterioration of the rice, it is said that the students smashed bowls in the dining hall and displayed the "hygienic rice" with half rice and half grain in the auditorium, inviting the president to have a "simple meal." As a result of this dining hall turmoil, the school authorities dismissed the person in charge of the general affairs department and promised to provide pure white rice in the future, which was finally resolved. According to a member of the youth group, the school fees last year were about 3,000 yuan per student per semester, while this semester they have risen to about 13,000 yuan. Some poor students have dropped out of school because they cannot afford it, or have even been encouraged to go elsewhere. The current students, like soldiers, are feared by the theaters, because they often go in groups, watch free shows without buying tickets, and cause disputes if interfered with.</p>
