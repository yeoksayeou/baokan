<p>代評</p>
<h3>夾攻中的奮鬥　陳彬</h3>
<p>今年是大東亞戰爭的決戰年，敵人將出其死力，以圖反攻。在前線的軍事反攻愈緊張，在後方的陰謀破壞就愈猛烈，這是在決戰階段戰略上必然的現象。目前巳漸入決戰的緊張階段，敵人正在前線圖逞反攻。上海是最後重地，敵人的陰謀破壞也正圖積極蠢動。我們絕不是故作危詞聳聽，更不是神經過敏的預測。我們必須認識現實的必然性，提高各自的警覺，應付這種陰謀破壞的環境，使敵人無法得逞。我們更須認識大東亞戰爭的勝利，一定從艱難奮鬥中爭取得來，愈是接近勝利，愈是加深艱難。最後勝利，常是屬於能夠堅持艱難奮鬥的一方。怎樣能夠堅持艱難奮鬥？「堅定信念」與「百折不回」是最主要的因素，而絕不是「僥倖」或是「賭運」的事。</p>
<p>現在更進而分析當前英美敵人所策動陰謀破壞工作的動向及其程度。可分下列數點：</p>
<p>第一是重慶特務人員方面。現在重慶本身，實際上已是英美的附庸，絕無自主不過間接為英美搖旗呐喊，反攻聲中的啦啦隊，同時以此爲報銷藉口而已。他們的主要工作，祇是製造謠言，危詞恐嚇，擾亂人心，破壞秩序。</p>
<p>第二是中共特務人員方面。中共份子與重慶份子，表面上雖爲共同立塲，施行陰謀破壞，但實際上同床異夢，矛盾正多，恰為渝兵摩擦的雛型。不過中共份子的活動力量較爲猖獗，陰謀技巧較爲險惡，以至破壞程度也較為毒辣。無孔不入，有路即鑽。</p>
<p>第三是和平區內的失敗主義者。這些失敗主義者，表面上是從事和平運動者，與渝共份子站在地對地位。可是，因為他們根本缺乏信念，反對革新運動，因顧自私自利，時時轉變其心理，容易被陰謀破壞者所利用，結果與實施陰謀破壞者同其影響。</p>
<p>為建設新中國，為實現大東亞共存共榮的理想，而艱苦奮鬥的志士們，處於當前的決戰階段，各方面陰謀破壞之中，於是工作日益吃重，而環境日益險惡。然而，建設新中國，實現大東亞共存共榮的理想，已為義無反顧的唯一使命，任何吃重的工作，任何險惡的環境，唯有以奮鬥精神去擔當，去應付。然則志士們究應怎樣的奮鬥呢？我們認為：</p>
<p>步驟不亂，堅定信念，向共同目標邁進。對於任何方面的陰謀破壞，縝密防範。不畏縮，不浮躁，不狐疑，不輕舉，才能不為利用，不被分化。</p>
<p>推進革新運動。對於政府施策，社會動態，力求革新，唯有政治淸明，社會安定，陰謀破壞，無所施展伎倆，不消而自滅。所以，革新運動是治本培元之道，必須　力推進。政府當局與社會領袖尤須肩起責任。</p>
<p>集合有志人士，共榮奮鬥。和平區內，對於建設新中國，實現大柬亞共存共榮理想的志士，相信不在少數，但必須集合起來　不致自亂陣腳，予敵以隙。</p>
<p>我們的當前是決戰階段，我們的周圍是險惡環境，已經面臨著緊要關頭，唯有振起在夾攻中奮鬥的精神！才能爭取到最後勝利！</p>
<h3>農業增產會揭幕　周副院長致訓詞　各省市代表報告工昨情形</h3>
<p>南京九日中央社電本年爲大東亞戰爭决勝年，當局以增加農業生產，爲本年度施政重點，中之重點特於本日（九日）在京中日文化協會召開各省農業增產會議。上午十時正，大會正式揭幕，由實業·糧食·建設·三都長親自主持。出席大會者計有實業·糧食·建設·三部主管人員，及中央各農業有關機關，各省市建設應長，糃食局長，會作事業委員會，及各地合作社理事長，商統會及其下層機構之主管人員，新運會及其各地分支會代表，又各有力之有關農業團體等代表，共約二百餘人。來賓方面計有葉蓬（杜侃之代）林柏生·張一鵬·周隆庠·沈爾喬，李謳一·戴英夫·薛逢元·奚則文·鐘任籌·及新任經濟顧問那須博士等數十人。行政院注院長特派副院周佛海代表蒞隨賜訓。行禮如儀後，首由大會主席顧寶衡致開會詞，旋由周副院長致訓，詞意懇擊，全體代表恭聆之下，咸極感奮·次來賓經濟顧問那須博士致詞畢，大會揭幕式即於軍樂聲中宣吿禮成·全體並攝影留念·又悉下午三時起，績開大會，由糧食·建設·實業·各部，及各省市代表，分別報吿以往工作，及今後計劃，並將推定分組審查提案委員等·</p>
<p>顧部長開會詞</p>
<p>今日實業·建設·繼食·三部會同召開各省市農業增進會議，各省市建設廳糃食局合作社新運會，及有關機關主管長官技術人員，均遠道來京出席，盟邦各有關高級長官顧問，復熱誠蒞臨指導，幷蒙主席派周副院長代表蒞會賜訓，與會代表羣才濟濟，共聚一堂，本人被推爲大會主席，躬逢其盛，實不勝感幸之至·我國自參戰以來，瞬經一載，舉國上下，均能一致奮起，努力於各部門工作之推進，其中農業增產一項，與增强戰力，安定民生，關係尤爲重大。過去各有關方面，業巳盡最大之努力，從事於此，爲借作今後改進上參考起見，英進展狀况，自須加以檢討。而本年度各項農業增產計劃，復經主管各部分別擬訂。此項計劇，在實施上，中央方面固當主持推行，更須各省市有關機關，共同協力，方有實效。現在春耕之期行將屆至，實爲增產運動發軔最適當之時機，故有本會之召集。邀同各省市有關機關，共同討論，其意義之重大，自無待言·按農業增產範圍至廣，欲求達到高度增產之目的，一方面須有詳盡具體的計劃，一方面更須有整個的組織系統，予以實施，二者幷重，方可上下推動，目標一致，其收效乃可宏大·本人就以往工作上所得之經騐。覺得對於本年度增產工作，有値得注意者數事。其一，過去增產工作，多偏重於點的設施，本年度當進而求普遍的推行，以期增產面積日見擴大。其二，過去增產工作在縱的方面，中央與地方辦法容未一致，在續的方面，亦間有個別進行，本年度當以統一方針，集中力量，共同邁進，以斯整個的予以有系統之實施。其三，過去農業改進指導工作，農民率處被動地位，本年當健全農民組織，培植其自動改進的習慣，以期農民成爲增產工作之中堅份子。凡此三點，不過爲本人工作上所得之感想，與會諸君均係實際從事增產工作人員，認識當更確切明瞭，尙希本諸學識經騐，以及各該地方情况，精密討論。更希望於會議之後，本諸議决案，努力推行農業增產，前途買爲幸甚。</p>
<p>周副院長訓詞</p>
<p>今天為各省市農業增產會義開會，主席對此會議異常重視，故令本人代表說幾句話。中國自參戰後，即確立經濟網領，其目標有二：一爲確保軍需，一爲安定民生·國府之一切經濟說施，亦均以兩目標爲鵠的。以言安定民生，必須國民足衣足食，如欲國民足衣足食，必須增加農產。以言確保軍需，現時大東亞戰爭戰事方殷，未來之勝利必繫於軍事經濟力量支持之久暫，如此以觀，經濟生產實爲獲得勝利之基礎·國府參戰後。因建軍工作尙朱完成，尙不能與盟邦軍隊並肩，共同作戰。但吾人可流汗致力於增產工作，以達到安定民生，確保軍需之兩大目的。在戰時狀態下，各國政府雖力謀安定民生，但國民依然感到痛苦，此點不僅交戰國如此，即中立國國民亦然。我們雖然不能消滅民生痛苦，但至少應減少民生痛苦。至於如何可以使國民足衣足食，以達到安定民生，確保軍需，即在實施農業增產，在增加農產之工作。實施原則上剛剛顧部長已有明瞭之說明，即將工作由點需推行到面，並加强縱橫之連繫、此外兄弟亦有兩點意見，貢獻於各位。　經費問題，經費之多寡，固然爲重大關鍵，但要其發揮宏大效力，亦在吾人之如何使用而定。吾人應盡力研求，能使用少數之金錢發揮宏大之效力，於此點希望各位多加注意研究。　切實執行，政　旣定有增產計劃，慶該努力實行，如果只是對上數衍，對下宣傳，自欺欺人，如此决無用處。尤其是農業增產，不比別的工作，應該切實執行，絲毫苟且不得，不如此不足以收效，如果各位能努力執行，則於中日之農業史上，必可劃一新紀元，於此庶上不負政府之希望，下不負國民之要求。</p>
<p>那須顧問致詞</p>
<p>國府本年度三大施策之肅正思想，保障治安，增加生產，因爲目前之　太問題。此三項重大問題。相互作有機的緊密連絡，在汪主席領導之下，努力推進，才能達到目的·同時增豪問題對大東亞戰爭之協力正多，今天適逢中國參戰紀念日，在此時舉行農業增產會議，實具有重大意義，農業增產工作實行很為困難，尤其在中國戰時之特別情形下，困難更多，要排除該項困難，幷非單純之農業基礎，或改善問題，須在經濟物價治安以及農業技術，農民知織等各方面，有激底之辦法。尤其要使農民深切明瞭農業增產之意義，才能完成。故農業增產工作之推進，除中央各部充分連絡外，更盼出席各代表，將農業增產意義，儘量設法使每一農民，均能深切了解，而樂於接受政府當局之指導，則增產工作之推進，始可事半功倍，</p>
<p>下午接開大會</p>

<h3>行政院定今日　召開淸鄉會議　已收到提案二十餘件</h3>
<p>南京九日中央社電　自大東亞戰爭入於决戰階段，淸鄕工作爲協力完遂戰爭目的起見，益感重要。自去年五月二十日最高國防會議决議，將淸鄕事務移歸行政院統一辦理之後，各地淸鄉工作，積極進展·茲行政院爲檢討過去淸鄕工作，及確立今後進行計劃，爰定於本月十日，召集淸鄕會議·除本京各有關部署長官皆將準時出席參加外，各省市長，各省市淸鄕事務局長，封鎖管理處長，淸鄕督察專員，均已陸續來京報到。收到提案共二十餘件，會議定於十日下午三時開始，預定由各省市長及工作單位報吿工作概况後，即開始討論。於今後關於淸鄕行政。軍事。文化·經濟·建設·財政等各項重要問題，有所商决，其意義至爲重大。</p>
<p>南京九日中央社電　自民國三十年六月，中央發動淸鄕工作後，旋設置淸鄕委員會·同年七月，淸鄕工作在蘇州區開始。其後次第推展，至太湖東南地區及浙省杭，嘉，上海，鎭江·南通及安徽等處，在人力組訓與物力動員方面，淸鄕地區已成爲國府統治下之模範區域。淸鄕工作開展與成功，爲和平建國前途所繫。自國府參戰以後，更負有鞏固作戰後方基地之重要任務。現淸鄕工作已有二年餘歷史，行政院爲檢討過去，策劃將來，使淸鄕工作益趨充實，力謀運行圓滑活潑，故此次召集各省市長官曁各地淸鄕負責人員，舉行省次淸鄕會議，商討確立今後淸鄕大計，此舉實極重要。淸鄕主旨，在使國府政治力，能推行及於鄕間，其具體綱目，爲肅正思想，確立洽安，改善民生。而情鄕會議之舉行，即爲謀該項綱目之具體實現，從基層健全而樹立建設新中國的體制，以貢獻更多之人力物力於大東亞解放戰爭，故此次淸鄕會議之舉行，意義極爲重大。</p>

<p>中島大佐解說戰況</p>
<p>東京九日中央社電　日南方軍司令部駐在地九日電，日南方軍司令部中島正三大佐，九日接見記者團，解說最近印緬邊境方面之戰况，並指摘敵方戰略之拙劣謂：根據日大本營七日之發表，南部印緬邊境日陸軍部隊，曾於四日晟對來攻日溪前方之英印軍第十六軍發動攻勢·僅數十小時，即攻陷意，更向　得頓及晶溪方而前進，而多想進攻緬甸，本所目覩晶軍轉作反攻，並展開包　陣式，乃大狼狽。七日蒙特巴頓司令部發表戰況謂：日軍攻破警備綫，估領頓巴札爾，誘過於偵察兵，但警備綫彼突破，非偵察兵之罪，昧於日軍戰略行動，夢想進攻緬甸之昏庸指導官等，實當負其全責。敵軍企圖奪回緬甸，曾三度計劃，三易其時，三更其地，去春於阿拉坎，去年十月於省怒江，十一月末於、北緬富貴，但悉遭折挫，未嘗獲分毫建樹。其屢戰　敗之原因，均係戰略拙劣所攻，尤以英人自腦部妄自尊大，而無可行之戰略。第一次之阿拉坎作戰中，敵軍主力爲日軍部隊所牽制，而日軍機動部隊則繞至其後，於兩月內完成大包圍陣，將英印軍第十四師團，八旅團共約四萬人完全殲滅，第二次之怒江作戰，渝軍活躍怒江西岸，以機進攻北緬，以日軍奇襲成功·敵方奪回緬甸之企圖，遂半途而廢，此藍英美軍首腦部不守同時攻擊之約，專擬利用渝軍所致，渝方派遣軍司令官陳誠更因是辭職。第三次之富貢作戰，仍以渝軍爲主力’而狡猶英人鑒於前此之失敗，特對作戰軍隊加一美國式訓練部隊之名，使美人將校指揮，欲圖廻避敗資任，是役渝軍受日軍痛擊，彷徨於富貢溪谷之陰濕地帶，直如喪、之犬。蒙特巴頓　任以來、會　解對奪還緬甸作戰遲遲不進之原因、時而藉口逼雨期，時而藉口　燥期，蒙特巴頓於日軍聲威之前，竟成二季節風」將軍。此次計劃進攻孟多，不知此一季節風一將軍之意見如何，或幻想由進攻孟多而奪回緬甸亦未可知，但實際將近二萬人之英印軍進攻部隊，於數小時內即陷人日軍包圍陣中，大有重演阿拉坎悲劇之勢。設英軍此次淮攻，乃係對渝軍作表面上之呼應，則好弄狡獪之英人，恐復將受到莫大犧牲，況神速日軍之側，尤有印度國民軍瞋目持搶共同作戰，吹毛求疵，以言進攻孟多，不致變爲吉大港之惡夢，即幸甚矣。</p>
<h3>日海軍機隊　襲馬加斯角　轟炸敵機場及運輸船</h3>

<h3>願忍受殘酷轟炸　芬戰意絕不動搖</h3>
<p>瑞典京城九日中央社電　芬蘭國民雖受蘇空軍之轟炸，與美國之威嚇，然决以最大决意奮勇防衛祖國。赫爾辛基之「首都報」曾於八日載稱：「赫爾辛基市民對蘇軍之轟炸，始終以鐵石之决意應之。芬問國民因受物質之損害，雖不免於困苦，但擬以威脅手段影響芬蘭國民之戰意絕不可能。</p>
<p>瑞典京城九日中央社電　芬闌首都赫爾辛基於六日夜遭蘇機轟炸時，通信聯絡悉被遮斷，故其詳情至八日始傳至此間。據謂此次轟炸機有一百五十架乃至一百八十架·炸死市民三十八人，炸傷二百三十二人。聞該地婦女刻已開始撤退，至因轟炸而起之火災，迄七日晨仍未撲滅</p>
<p>美向芬提要求</p>
<p>赫爾至辛基九日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：此間情報局於今日發表官方文告，證實外傳美國務卿赫爾已由美駐芬公使轉向芬政府提出新要求，該文吿並未透露該項新要求之性質。</p>
<p>里斯本九日中央社軍據華盛頓息：美國務卿赫爾八日曾聲明美政府對芳蘭加以外交壓迫，强使共脫離戰綫一事。然芬蘭駐美公使館當局對該證明，則表明該國無脫離戰綫之意。略謂：「芬蘭之地位無任何變化，縱首都化爲灰燼，芬蘭亦不致改變態度，</p>
<h3>英與法解放會　訂財政協定</h3>
<p>瑞典京城九日中央社電　據倫敦息，英財相安德森昨在下院宣稱：英政府已與阿爾及爾法解放委員會簽釘協定兩種，　第一協定規定一金鎊兌換二百法郞之匯兌率，在阿爾及爾委員會轄境內立即發生效力。　第二種爲一標準互助協定，雙方無償互相供給作戰必需品。集團，以別於所謂金鎊集團，其對此等地方輸出品之付款，須以該地之合法貨幣或由法國輪入品之金鎊存款中付給之。</p>
<h3>蘇分權計劃　引起柏林注意</h3>
<p>柏林九日中央社電　德國新聞社訊，據塔斯社息，泮諾馬里夫被任爲白俄羅斯之人民委員會主席，此事引起柏林政界之注意。泮氏現爲白俄羅斯共黨之主任秘書，而烏蘭克州之人民委員會主席格魯契夫，亦任該州同樣之職務，此可見斯達林所導演之所謂分議計劃之把戲，即蘇聯政府並不實行分權，不過係利用共黨之幫助，建立各共和國與克姆林宮間更密切之聯　而已。</p>
<h3>尼科波爾德軍　作戰略撤退　南路戰事尤為激烈</h3>
<p>柏林九日中央社電　德國新聞社，據德元首行營發表：德軍具有堪爲棋範之作戰精神，於尼科波爾·契爾喀賽之西·歇希哥夫之東·貝里新拉之東·伊爾門湖之西及南·及魯加戰區中，猛力展開激烈之攻防戰，擊退蘇軍强大之攻勢，並粉碎其突破企圖。德陣局部之凹陷，或業經填平或已被封閉，德軍於破壞軍事設備及戰時工業後，已由尼科波爾橋頭堡實行有計劃之撤退。</p>
<p>柏林九日中央社電德國新聞社訊：德軍於星期一日沿聶伯河下游，繼續其縮短與改進陣錢之行動，而未遭敵方重大之反抗。克星伏洛格之東南，一時亦有太規模之戰事，該處德軍機械化部隊不顧蘇軍頑强之抵抗與不斷之進攻，將自己陣綫向前推進數公里。　　柏林九日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：東綫北路戰局一時陷於　着狀態後，南綫蘇軍之兩焦點頓形熾烈，蘇軍集結大軍猛攻尼科波爾及基洛伏格勒·貝拉耶柴爾柯夫問之德軍陣地。東錢氣候稍有變化，但仍極寒冷，主要戰塲猶多泥濘與霆雨。尼科波兩橋頭堡德軍時遭蘇軍猛攻，尤以北方之壓拍最爲强烈，尼科波爾西北方翁　　空前激戰，德軍猛烈反攻·蘇軍蒙受車創，基洛伏格勒·貝拉耶柴爾柯夫中間地區，乃南綫第二焦點，蘇軍爲阻止德軍之對抗行動，現正加重成脅，繼續攻擊德軍，德軍巳增派有力之機械化部隊與之展開壯烈之白刃戰，戰綫呈混亂狀態。波倫諾埃區德軍機械化部隊，於該地西方猛烈反攻，似爲奉制聶伯河理曲部地區，蘇軍之攻勢自側面攻擊，眞相尙朱判明·舊波蘭國境西方，羅夫諸與虜克兩區，刻仍擬績激戰中·蘇軍若加重壓迫，德軍即以退雜戰法節約兵力。</p>

<h3>德使用野豬戰鬥機　黑夜防空威力無比</h3>
<p>柏林九日中央社電　據海通社訊：德國單引整夜間戰鬥機，係赫曼上校所設計，於去秋巳開始始使用作戰，航空界稱爲「赫曼戰鬥機」或「野猪」。去夏英機屢次集中轟炸德國城市，赫曼上校建議以大批單座戰鬥機應戰，即在漢堡第一次大規模使用。英機於去年八九月大規模空製柏林。亦遷此項夜間戰鬥機之痛擊而減弱英攻勢。此項　鬥機仿照一梅塞許密特一〇九」式及福克烏爾夫一九〇」式　造，其駕駛員須受嚴裕訓練，因夜間起飛及降落甚爲危險，且冬季氣候亦爲單座戰鬥機之國礙，因缺乏雙引擎戰鬥機之盲目飛行等各項優點。</p>
<h3>向納吐諾橋頭　德發動反攻　反軸心軍瀕於危境</h3>
<p>粕林九日中央社電　德國新開社訊，軍息：義南部阿普里亞戰區中之德軍，頃巳由西·北·及　北二方面，向英美軍之安齊沃·納吐諾橋頭堡展開攻勢，德軍已於數處突破敵陣，並抵達　定之目樑地。</p>
<p>里斯本九日中央社電　反戰心軍刻正在納吐諾橋頭堡積極加强軍力。據合衆社從軍記者於八日率直承認反軸心軍之窮境，謂反軸心軍步兵及戰車部隊，曾於七日在安齊沃至阿普里亞之公路上，連續發動殊死之防禦戰，其理由係因該公路如一旦失守，則整個橋頭堡將瀨於危境·在此狹隘之橋頭堡已有若干主要地點爲德軍佔領，德軍更遣砲兵隊前進，猛擊登陸地點，與反軸心軍曾展開肉搏戰。</p>
<p>柏林九日中央社電　德軍當局八日發　：納吐諾橋頭堡反軸心軍，數日來已轉作守勢，德軍長距離砲之猛烈轟擊，已建有牽制敵軍之偉功。德空軍炸焚納吐諾登陸敵運輸船一艘燃料庫數處，此外並炸毀敵商船四艘共一萬四千噸。卡西諸西北方，美第五軍正整頓陣容，於加里格利亞諾河口並數設地雷，顯示敵現時無意前進，惟致力於守禦云。</p>
<p>柏林九日中央社電　據海通社訊：原在美第五軍後方遙爲聲援之英步兵五十六（師，已忽忽趕到納吐諾橋頭堡，足徵反軸心軍在納吐諾及安齊沃登睦已陷絕境。實此次反軸心的敗績，大部可歸功於德軍之重砲，及長射程砲猛　反軸心軍之密集點及兩地港外之船隻·德軍之「山麓戰略」亦已見功效，蓋以重砲位建於兩地平原周圍山中，具有天然之屛障，又可逐漸增加大力而不爲反軸心砲火所及·</p>

<h3>南婆羅洲米糧　準自由販賣</h3>
<p>馬來九日中央社電　南婆羅洲自去年八月起禁止自由販賣米糧，現地當局鑒於米糧之預定貯藏數貴已圓滿達成，故自七日起已准自由販賣。</p>
<h3>英土談判　現陷於僵局</h3>
<p>里斯本九日中央社電　據倫敎新聞記事報駐安加拉通訊員喬登報吿：自開羅會議以來，反軸心與土耳其間繼續不斷之談判，頃已終止。喬氏力稱，此種談判雖於私人友好善意之空氣中舉行，但仍不掩英美當局間之嚴重爭執。其爭執之點·不在土國對一九三九年條約所負責任有所異議，而在土國於履行該約條件之前，認爲應予明白知悉各點。</p>
<h3>歐洲要塞的攻防戰（二）　朝日新聞座談會</h3>
<p>今井特派員（阿根廷京城）（絕交以前發電）　英美的進攻歐洲，我也以為將選擇英法海峽而從正面攻擊。何以遲玀不進呢？他們鑒於義大利作戰的經騐，如不能在主要戰塲上擊破德國的陸軍，不能使德國敗北。反軸心軍能够充分使用其機械化部隊與機甲部隊的大兵力之戰塲，不過北法與比荷兩低地國；他如巴爾幹，義大利，南法均爲險岨的山嶽地帶，與歐洲大陸的中心部分離。</p>
<p>另一方面，要在挪威登陸，其海岸錢亦不甚便利。且英美以爲如果侵入挪威，同時，將造成蘇聯侵入芬闌，並迫使瑞典傾向軸心的結果·所以剩下的唯一進路，還是從東方衛歐洲的側面呢？還是從西方進攻。</p>
<p>某德國軍事通觀察英美軍將以二三百萬大軍運到蘇聯，以聯合兵力從東部開始對德大攻勢。但英美方面的結論，從英法海峽侵入，最初登陸時雖不無困難，但却是唯一的道路。英法海峽的運糧綫距離最短，日戰鬥機亦易於出動。至其時期，大約將在春季將終的時候‘此次再遲，羅斯福的四成　　就發生問題，且這時候是英法海峽中氣候狀態最好的季節，在此以前，英美軍利用冬季與初春的盡短夜長，爲儘量削弱德軍的防衛陣地，繼續大規模的戰路轟炸，一面並以全力從事大規模的水陸作戰準備，</p>
<p>伊　特派員（瑪德　）　歐洲登陸在　近即將實現。蓋從英美兩國的國內情形看來，勢必於本年內見之事實。德黒蘭會談會，組織對歐洲作戰本部，頻頻宣傳，將在年末至一月之間，但現在又說五月了。當然英國海岸集結了許多空船，護送船從直布羅陀向東的往來頻繁。而且科西嘉亦集有大軍，準備就緒。一般觀察如其不能在一月登陸，將在四月末與五月初</p>
<p>東部戰綫之冬季，至三月半吿終，四月溶雪，就不能作戰，與東部戰綫的時期對照起來，乃有此種說法。且英法海陝的冬季氣候不佳，不適於空軍作戰及登陸部隊的戰車進擎。其次，說到在何處登陸的問題，戰爭中沒有奇跡，就常識而言，首當其衛的是北法，比，荷海岸，用空軍保護運輸船在挪威登陸說，並在科西嘉集結部隊登陸南法及巴爾幹說亦頗有力。</p>
<p>茂木特派員（里斯本）本地亦頗多五月左右的觀測。義第二戰綫勢將於蘇聯的攻數合拍·三月中旬，東部戰錢一帶開始融雪，蘇聯的攻勞在洛霧完畢的四月底劊將暫吿軍止，或遲鈍。假使英美一定要在二月中開始第二戰綫，則蘇聯準備沒有元威，所以預料將在五月初旬·當然英美將以第二戰綫的犧牲止於最小限度爲標準，而選擇其時期與塲所，他們所最怕的一點乃是京部戰綫並其中的德軍將轉而保衛第二戰錢。所以他們將等待東部戰綫最緊張的時期，而塲所亦將選擇數地同時開始。</p>
<p>德，法，荷，比的大西洋岸，西班牙·法蘭西的國境綫附近，或亞得里亞海，南斯拉夫，希臘等海岸，均將在短時間內同時發動。中立國方面的觀測，目前英美正在準備英法海峽中五十個師團作戰上所必需的五百萬頓船腹·（待續）（翔：譯自二月二日西部朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>日陸軍報道部　發表最近戰况　緬甸及太平洋方面</h3>
<p>中央社訊　日在滬陸軍部報道部所主持之定例報道常會，昨下午三時假南京路外灘華懋飯店八樓舉行，該部計到坂本中尉，赤星囑托，席間由發言人報道緬甸及太平洋方面戰局綦詳，茲將發表談話大意如次：</p>
<p>緬甸方面最近戰况</p>
<p>「英美兩國反攻日本，益趨激烈，同時大東亞戰爭亦進入决戰階段，敵美於太平洋方面，突破日軍外廓防禦綫，直接進攻馬紹爾羣島，並緬甸方面戰機亦漸熟，日軍於二月四日首先頓挫敵軍，開始進擎中，待機進擊祖國已久之自由印度國民軍精銳部隊，亦參加作戰，並與日軍在緊密聯絡下到處擊退敵軍，繼續進擊，此誠爲自由印度政府向新德里進軍之第一步，殊具重大意義。關於英美反攻緬甸事，英美兩國曾誇張宣傳已久，至今已逾三月，且雨期又將復至，然彼等仍未正　開始反攻，美國對此延遲未開始反攻之理由，會解說稱緬甸反攻作戰延遲之理由，並非由於蒙特巴頓將軍作戰計劃之延遲，其主要原因實在於蒙特巴頓與華維爾移交事務時，意外費長時日，同時向印度方面之補充軍需品亦感困難，美國之此種解說，完全與彼等宣傳緬甸反攻益趨活躍事，完全相反，現緬甸方面見敵軍蠢動之處爲馬猶半島布其頓日溪正面，英第十四軍主力爲先鋒之英印軍，由該方面向日溪北方之文達及布期頓方面挺進，同時渝軍向福根溪谷方面企圖進擊，然日軍已於四日開始進擊敵軍，同時日空軍部隊與陸上部隊協力下，粉碎敵軍蠢動，預料敵軍將逢第二次阿拉坎之悲劇。又衛立煌所指揮之緬甸遠征軍，曾在緬甸北部蠢動，然該軍因在日軍進攻雲南作戰時受極大打擊，故目下並無蠢動之色。</p>
<p>英美突入馬島目的</p>
<p>至於英美兩軍以水上機動部隊，突人日軍內綫防禦地域馬紹爾羣島之目的，大凡有四：　新不列顛島及拉巴爾方面之防備過於堅固，因此敵機之犧牲極大，敵軍認爲若攻擎該方面，殊爲困難，故敵軍改圖由吉爾勃時向馬紹爾挺進，使日軍酉南太平洋基地陷於孤立。　英美圖於獲得馬紹爾島後，再襲擊日軍海軍基地托拉克島或小笠原島，俾直接攻進日本本土。工另一方而截斷南方日軍佔領地區資源地帶，與日本本土間之運輸綫，使日軍需資源陷於枯竭。　對軸心國神經戰，使宣傳戰趨於有利，至在政治上則準備於美國選舉總統時，羅斯福能獲得獲選地位。以上各目的在敵國方面殊爲無謀，由此足見敵國對戰局有焦急之色。同時日本於開發南方資源及增產飛機時，則時機對日本殊爲有利，故敵軍有鑒於此，竭力企圖於目下先征服日本，以免永遠失去良機，否則美國本身亦限於危機。至於擊滅英美之戰爭，决非能極容易獲得，最後勝利其戰爭過程中，必須覺悟將逢更重大之局面，同時更須準備有防備之心。英美最近於反攻之際，復頻頻展開宣傳戰，企圖搗亂思想，即所謂神經戰術，例如僞造日軍虐待敵俘虜或日本之生產趨弱化，或誇大宣傳，所獲戰果等，在在均圖搗亂軸心國民心，此等均為彼乖圖隱蔽本身弱點之手段，例如英美軍曾不法轟炸日紅十字船維諾斯愛勒號等，即一例也。</p>
<p>吾人巳於此次大東亞戰爭中，充分見到脫去仁義道德假面具之美國人本本面目，然須警戒者即以往受英美支配或依存英美而生活之若千上海人心理。</p>
<h3>節約協會　二次理事會</h3>
<p>上海特別市節約協會於昨日（九日）下午四時三刻，在大上海路一六〇號會所舉行第二次全體理事會議，出席者計有金宗城·魯風（任雲鵬代），鄭煒顯·陳東白·陳彬龢·陳福康·陳正章·陳九峰·陳霖笙·程志良·許力求（蔣雲章代），王平·任雲鵬·徐頤淸·萬雪舫·言永孝·黃警頑·吳孝侯·張永定·楊　祚等數十人，由副理事長金宗城主席，討論議案頗多。各理事對推行節約意見闡述甚詳，日內將與當避協商一發，以期澈底實行節約，貢獻於國家社會，至六時散會。</p>
<h3>日辻政信大佐演講　「告日本僑胞」</h3>
<p>中央社訊日駐華派遣軍總司令部辻政信大佐，於八日日本對英美宜戰紀念日，應與亞報國會之邀請，自下午四時至六時，在上海國際劇塲以「吿日本僑胞」爲題演講，辻大佐憑本身經騐，說明南方作戰中飛機有與日軍之忠勇奮戰有同樣之重要性，並力言中日兩民族，如能緊密提携，非但英美兩國即與全世界敵亦不足懼。辻大佐之演購對如何解决中日事變，尤多闡述，希望日本僑胞協力新政策，茲摘錄其要旨如下：</p>
<p>舉國人民抱此决心</p>
<p>戰局前途，日趨熾烈，邇來迭聞戰報，謂敵人巳在馬紹爾登陸，佔據吉爾貝特，或謂千島受炸，使人有朝失一島，晚失一島，令人心盧之感，但此種見解，極端錯誤，若從戰略的立塲而下判斷，戰塲　近本國，敵人所受損失越軍，而作戰愈易，爲完遂大東亞戰爭，余確信必有百萬人犧牲，但此種大犧牲，應忍受，如將敵千萬人擊潰，則百萬之犧牲，猶爲値得。戰爭之結果，凡國民有失敗之念者，則必失敗無疑，若遭逢任何困難，始終抱必勝决意，則最後必勝於敵人。日俄戰爭爲求生存自衛之戰爭，此次大東亞戰爭爲使全東亞從英美壓迫中解放之東亞解放戰，吾人應有覺悟大東亞戰十倍於日俄戰爭，舉國人民，如有此决心，大東亞戰爭始得解决。敵寇在任何戰爭中，無不爲本身而戰，乘機　食東亞土地，至今我十萬萬有色民族，已屆團體奮起之時，决不依恃他人力量，唯有求自己，以日本爲中心，聯合同志國家齊力以赴，東亞人國境隣接·此爲天命，爲天賜之宿命也。</p>
<p>中日握手世界無敵</p>
<p>余過去轉戰各地，最初一次係在江灣鎭與蔡廷楷之十九路軍作戰，嗣後在山西與渝方之中央軍，在諾于亭與蘇聯軍，在馬來與英軍，在巴打半島與美菲軍，所羅門方而與澳洲軍美軍作戰，憑余之經騐最强者首推中國軍，此斷語或爲諸位認爲不可思議，但以同樣裝備，在同一戰塲對敵，則中國之中央軍最强，蘇軍次之，此因蘇聯軍血脈中，亦有一部係東洋血液在內，等而下之，爲美國英國澳洲，如强盛之中國，再更强之日本握手，則世界無敵此固可斷言者。</p>
<p>中携手始能有在</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭現已進入决戰階段，在此戰爭之中途上，日本曾表明對華新方針，所謂此表方針者，即日本已認　戰爭六年來之中國及世界，並認為唯與中國携手並进，始有日本之存在，同时唯有循此途径，始能與戰争之大目的相符合，此方針即吾國天皇陛下之恩惠，吾人若能互相實踐比恩惠，則中日事變通江期而獲解决，在中國之百萬軍官民，若各人能與對百萬之中國同志認爲真正同志，則事變可謂已早能獲得解决，渝方現正注視上海之情形，並靜觀日本新政策眞假，唯有實踐此新方針，始能解决事變。大東亞戰爭之解决，乃擊於中日事變之處理上，同時上海十萬日僑均持有解决事變之關鍵。</p>
<p>道義精神祭蔣母墓</p>
<p>余於十五月二十五日赴浙東寗波奉化時，　日軍司令官之命令，祭祀七八年來因戰爭而被遺忘之蔣太夫人靈，余與汪主席所指派之　中將，在滬定　極大花圈，乘飛機同往，當時奉化處日軍及渝軍雙方之間，吾人召集中國民眾，並謂將介石光生乃為貴鄉英進現蔣太夫人之墳墓荒廢至如此，實非適當也，然日本為道義而戰，故召集彼我兩方同祭，並解除警備，更請僧人五十人舉行大　事一星期，當時居住於渝方地區中之蔣規族亦來同祭，彼等眞誠感激日方此種道義精神，余復語當地居民謂請轉告蔣介石先生不論五年十年，請安心作戰，在戰爭期中日軍决代爲守衛蔣太夫人之墓，戰爭與道義，在此根本爲二件事，决守至最後一兵爲止，此誠爲日本之道義，此種言語旣非謀略，又非策謀，實由於日軍司令官之道善好意。</p>
<p>切實實踐道義精神</p>
<p>在此上海物價高漲生活匪易之際，余時聞各保甲獻機軍動極有成績、誠不　感激之至，同時余時聞上海方面有多數善行善事，又余曾與滬上友人談及若吾人以赤誠之心對待他人，决不致無人跟隨吾人也，然　遺憾者，即具有權力及力量之軍人，尙有缺乏百　性者，此點决加以改進，吾人處於目下之戰局中，决不可一喜一憂，對國體之本義，有徹底之認職，以不後退及必勝信念而實行，同時吾人於實行真正日本本來之奉態及這義時，大東亞戰爭可在中國獲得終局，唯由於此而始能為東亞之盟主，若吾人不為吾人應為之事，或行非道義之行爲，或侮辱輕視中國人，則决無一人跟隨日本，吾人欲為東亞指導者，决非吾人之目的乃爲結果，余望在滬十萬日僑，切實實踐道義，諸君之此種正當行爲，能反映重慶，重能反映世界，並望各人以兵士决死之心，努力於完成大東亞戰爭。</p>

<p>昨日發　時間七點四十分</p>
<p>經濟界</p>
<h3>評言　再論農業增產會議</h3>
<p>上月三十日我們曾論農業增產會議，認爲今年的增產運動，不管用什麼方法來增產，必須抱着一個最低限度的目標，就是確保國內食糧之帶給，因爲糧食問題，在戰事時期，可以說是决定軍事勝負，人心向背的一個因素，實非言之過甚。</p>
<p>昨日在京揭幕之全國農業增產會議，由實糧建三部長親自主持，足徵政府當局對推進農業增產工作所具之誠意與决心。說到農茉增產的方法，歸納言之，自不外擴充面積，改良栽培方法，以求產量之增加，育成新種，以圖質量之增進，防治災害，以圖損耗之減少，經營大規模農塲，並利用機械，以圖生產費之減輕，此外，有如本年度華中增產對策中，有　井，擴充採種塲，添派農業技術員，配給化學肥料，預防病虫之設施，農具之配給及改善等等節目，均足作爲農業增產計劃之根據。</p>
<p>以上所說，都還是屬於技術方面的，至於在金融方面，尤當積極鼓勵推進對村貸款之放出，以求農業生產資金之圓滑化，同時，爲防止農村通貨膨脹，則宜獎勵貯蓄，以吸收一般浮動資金。凡此種種，雖不過舉其要綱而言，要皆爲我們所熱烈期待於全國農業增產會議者。</p>
<h3>物價評議會　統辦評價事宜　中央市塲不再執行評議</h3>
<p>市政府前以物價上漲，亟當設法遏止，以安民生，早經令准經濟局設立物價評議委員會，將本市評價專宜，統歸該會辦理，統一事權，而專責成，又政府已通令各公會商號，關於此後加價事項，應呈由物價評議委員會審核，以滬市三字第一五五九〇號訓令，禁止中央市塲執行評價。茲將該項訓令探錄於後，查近日物價上漲，亟當設法遏止，評定價格，尤爲治本之道，以前該市場自行公布價格，殊非所宜，現者經濟局業已奉准成立物價評議委員會，所有本市評價事宜，自應統歸該會辦理，以一事權，而專責成，該塲塲長亦係該會評議員，如有意見，儘可提付討論，開會决定，自奉令日起，該市塲不得再執行評偎事項，又如有商號呈請加價渚，應將全案提會决定，以爲全市實施之標準，除由本府另行通吿各公會商號，此後加價事項，應向該會呈請外，特此申令禁止該塲評定物價，並迅將以前所評物價送會審核公佈，否則不得作爲合法交易之根據，仰即遵照辦理，並將遵辦情形，具報爲要。</p>
<h3>當局積極籌劃　調整統配機構　各業希望增配物資</h3>
<p>本市主管富局，爲使各業按期獲得充分物資，維持正常營業，普遍應銷起見，已在積極準備計劃將統配機構予以澈底調整，同時對配給日期及數量，亦均將加以改善，綠自當局實施統配以來，一般經過情形，尙稱良好，然對配給數量方血，雖迭經各業公會呼籲增加，迄今未得當局邀准，故各業公司工廠商號，均不得已限制生產量，如彈花業公會所屬各會員商號，平日製成品爲棉花胎與彈花二種，但其所需之原棉及紗綫兩種原料，至今未曾配得，以致營業極感困難，至於各麵製業商號，雖已獲得二期之配給麵粉，然因數量過少，不敷應用，故亟盼富局，今後能按照各業公會之營業範闡，分別核定其等級，予以適當之物資配給。</p>
<h3>二警局取締　超越限價</h3>
<p>春節以來，本市銀錢業採取緊縮放款政策，籍以防杜囤積，戢止剌激物價之卜騰，乃查邇來生活日用物品又趨活躍，直接間接均足以影響社會民生，本市第二警察局，爲切實取締各業之超越限價起見，頃特分令所屬各分局及區警察局等，此後在各該管轄境內，各業如有利用時機超越限價等事，仰即從嚴取締，安定民生云。</p>
<h3>華股先疲後堅　紡織業股獨見堅挺</h3>
<p>昨日華股市情，上午仍形疲軟，至下午稍見回好，脚地亦已較上日晚收時硬，結果各業股仍升降互見，紡織股冷門多見上升，如統益，大公，公勝，大統，義大均見面榮，美亞，信和，大通等反較平疲，景福衫襪仿在增賽消息中盤上，百貨股光華獨堅，永安等三公司小挫，文化業晋豐造紙突升一元半，中影與書局股帶軟，新藥業呆平，化工業多見軋小，地產業永興，新益，國華，均稍做高，南洋烟公司堅定，久安與利亞實業略升，除帶平波，今分誌晚收介於後。</p>

<h3>海軍</h3>
<p>— 岩田豐雄著　洪羊譯</p>
<h3>四號生徒（六）</h3>
<p>四月一日，一個艷陽的春天。饅後决定許可入學的靑年們，午前七時都聚齊在校門前，派定了各人所屬的分隊。眞人被分派在和熊澤一起的十六分隊。</p>
<p>分隊監事是一個沒留鬍髪，態度沈淸的S少佐。S少佐將新人學生帶到浴塲去，像說笑般地說着。「要把俗世的應垢都洗去！」</p>
<p>「俗世」這名詞的意義，眞人是不大明瞭。</p>
<p>洗完澡後，就要換上新的軍服。回想到這細腰的短制服隆夫是怎樣地憧憬着，不由地悲從中來。穿上制服以後，他發見褲子有毛病，就對身旁的熊澤說。「這條褲子，沒有褲兜兒啊……」</p>
<p>二中的校服也有的，但是這個制服倒沒有。那是爲了禁止在寒冷的時候，將手藏進去的粗俗醜形狀，這在眞人是還不曉得的。</p>
<p>「再不放棄方言，恐怕要被人笑的。」熊澤却注意到這方面來了。</p>
<p>新入學生們從浴塲又被領到壯麗的學生館來了。在那裏有自已所屬分隊的自習室。和普通學校的寄宿舍不同，擺着有很多的像敎室裏用的書桌。在正面中央的　子上掛着一個很美麗的木匣。在那裏頭有分隊的名簿。</p>
<p>他們又被領到三樓的　室去了。很淸潔的白毛氈，疊着很整齊的，舖位放在那裘。白毛氈上都有靑色的綫紋，那是爲甚麼緣故，他們也不得而知。只是在各人舖位的旁邊，都放着很堅固的匣子，打開一看，有種種的衣服，使他最喜歡的，就是在衣服上面。擱着一把短劍。傎人將這鑲着金邊的短劍、在往腰問掛的時刻，先稍微地抽出一看。並不是玩具……利刃的光輝耀輝奪目。而且聽到那鐵匣的名子呌Chest的時候，他想到和這　相似的薩摩方言，不覺要笑出聲來。</p>
<p>不大的工夫，在這裏的貪堂吃了初次的午飯。是咖哩飯。比鹿兒島的西餐還好吃。對這食堂的寬大，老學生們態度的文雅，實在是讃佩得很</p>
<p>午後一時，有入學式。將各人的宣誓重整理一起，送給校長。校畏是中將，帶着眼鏡，一個慈顏悅色的將軍。其次便開始不讀賜與軍人的勅證。繼續着奉拜御照，心裏感到一種不可名狀的尊嚴，眞人在此時，纔深切地感到自己巳經是海軍兵學校的學生了。</p>
<p>海軍兵學校的學生，不是普通所謂的學生。是已經入了眾藉的。所以都賜與判任武官的待遇的。谷眞人的個人的生命，可以說是在這裏已經貢戲給國家了。</p>
<p>（七）</p>
<p>兵學校學級的稱呼，是和普通一般相反的。最高級的四年生是一號學生，最末尾的一年生是四號學生。若以爲數目多便可以目空一切，那是完全錯了，四號學生是被串叱的對像，從敎官以下全體的上級學生都是，而申叱的對像，一個也沒有。在兵學校，不大用這申叱的名詞。都呌着「訓練」。這樣看來，四號生訓練的對像，唯有自己一個人。</p>
<p>總而言之，谷眞人，是在經騐着海軍兵學校六十七期生的四號時代。期的數字，不但不能隨着號的數字改變，就是一生也不能變更的。這同期生的友誼，是社會上所想像不到的親密，一生永久繼續着。作了士官以後，假定同期生有一人死去的時候。社會上」般的同級會，只不過連名贈送花環，這便是以表示友誼的深厚，但是兵學校的期會，不但　全　儀的一切，並且對遺族將來的一切，都要給計畫到的。無論是結婚的時候，或是有意外的虧空的時侯，都先和同期的人相商的。這種情逾骨肉的友誼，並非那君子之交淡如水可比擬的。發生了這種骨肉之親關係的起源，據說是也由這四號學生時代被「訓練」時，共甘苦而來的。</p>
<p>像那窄狹的門，好容易地得以潛進去了的新四號學生，得意揚揚地入了學校，也是當然的現像，但是沒過一天的工夫，都悄然無聲了。囚爲這裏，是另一個天地。雖然從能也聽到過這裏是一個淸凈而規律嚴正的世界。但是進來一看，却像踏進了一個東西莫辨的另外的天地似的。一天到晚，對以前的生活是一點兒也不通用的。態度，言語，行路，吃飯，睡覺，一切都和從來不同的。好像世間同這另一個天地隔着一條不能越過的鴻溝似的。在第一次洗澡的時候，「要將俗世的塵垢洗去」的話，好像朦朧地明白起來了。而且過着和「俗世」完全相反的生活的上級學生，宛然是一種超人似的，不得不感佩起來。</p>
<p>有一天晚上在分隊自習室裏，有自我的介紹。這也是去掉俗習的一種禮法。</p>
<p>「呌谷眞人，鹿兇島縣二中的出身。」</p>
<p>真人留心說着標準語，可是分隊伍工是不許可的：</p>
<p>「甚麼呌着俺，海軍學生是不用那種話。呌「我」知道了。」</p>
<p>分隊伍長是最上級生—一號學生的優秀者做分隊伍長的。並且分隊是從四號到一號的學生都混合在內，是有特別的意義的。那同鹿兒島的健兒舍的組織相似，所以真人對這種意義，較別人是先理解的。</p>
<p>國民論壇</p>
<h3>論中等教育問題</h3>
<p>— 君子</p>
<p>敎育二字在今日之意義，已不僅在灌輸學問，而重在敎養學子，使成爲將來社會國家有用之人，如確認後者爲切當，則學校敎育尤以中等敎育，當以適應現實即適應今後國家社會之需要爲目標，而今後國家社會所需要之人民，當以下列數項爲前提：</p>
<p>有堅强之體魄及靈活之腦力。有堅强之體魄靈活之腦力，則上焉者即能任重致遠，造就不世之才，下焉者亦足以勤勞工作，自食其力，勿爲社會之寄生虫。旦高尙之德行，豐富之學識，亦莫不產生於堅强之體魄與靈活之腦力，就犯罪行爲，莫非病態即可知之。堅强之體魄，可以養成忍耐勇毅，而知所趨避；靈活之腦力，可以養成精思熟慮，而明辨是非，故今日之敎育莫不以此二者爲出發點。一方面使有充分鍛鍵身體之機會，一方面使有充分鍛鍊腦力之機會。</p>
<p>明識個人對於社會之關係及其應盡之天職，今日個人之生活已無法與社會相絕緣，則其朝夕所對之社會公衆，自應作爲個人生活轉變之規範，而加以確切認識，尤應訓練其對於社會公衆應盡之義務，而公衆之紀律必使其知所遵守，如是社會方得日趨進化，而從來個人之私利觀念，方得掃除擴淸</p>
<p>普遍之常識爲適應時代適應當前之環境起見，人人皆應賦有最低限度之常識，此即學問之灌輪矣。然此種學間之灌輸以其目標在求適應時代與環境，故務必求其能靈活機變，同時務使學子能確實吸收確實致用。從來之呆板敎育，呆板讀書，學而不知致用者，務須竭力免除之，且中學生年齡尙幼，體力未充，功際只宜求切於實用，而不宜過於繁重。必須顧到其是否堪以消化，是否確切領悟，與其多而濫，無如少而精</p>
<p>斯三者實爲今日中等敎育之要義，亦吾人引導靑年學子之責任，對於女意初無異於男童，蓋縱日後為家庭服務者，亦不失爲社會國家之一部份，而有同等之需要也。</p>

<h3>公園門票漲價</h3>
<p>本月二十五日公園門票漲價，一般市民頗爲驚異，按公園爲市民健康問題着想而設立，但　日高價出售門票，使一般平民再無遊園之日，以致百病易起影響市民健康，若當局眞能爲市民謀幸福，則應略減門券售價爲盼（李應淸）</p>

<h3>The Struggle Amidst Encirclement - Chen Bin</h3>
<p>This year is the decisive year of the Greater East Asia War. The enemy will exert their utmost strength in an attempt to counterattack. The more intense the military counterattacks on the front lines, the more rampant the conspiracies and sabotage in the rear. This is an inevitable phenomenon strategically during the decisive stage. Currently, we are gradually entering the tense phase of the decisive battle. The enemy is trying to launch a counterattack on the front lines. Shanghai is the last vital stronghold, and the enemy's conspiracies and sabotage are also actively stirring. We are by no means deliberately making alarming statements to create a sensation, nor are we making oversensitive predictions. We must recognize the inevitability of reality, heighten our vigilance, and cope with this environment of conspiracies and sabotage to prevent the enemy from succeeding. We must also recognize that the victory of the Greater East Asia War will certainly be won through arduous struggle. The closer we get to victory, the more profound the difficulties become. Ultimately, victory always belongs to the side that can persevere in arduous struggle. How can we persevere in arduous struggle? "Firm belief" and "unyielding spirit" are the most important factors, and it is by no means a matter of "luck" or "gambling."</p>
<p>Now, let's further analyze the current trends and extent of the conspiracies and sabotage orchestrated by the British and American enemies. This can be divided into the following points:</p>
<p>First, regarding personnel of the Chongqing secret service: Chongqing itself is now virtually a vassal of Britain and America, with no autonomy whatsoever. They are merely indirectly waving the flag and shouting slogans for Britain and America, a cheering squad in the midst of counterattack cries, while using this as an excuse for reimbursement. Their main task is simply to create rumors, make alarmist threats, disturb people's minds, and disrupt order.</p>
<p>Second, regarding personnel of the Chinese Communist secret service: Although the Chinese Communist elements and Chongqing elements appear to be on the same front superficially, carrying out conspiracies and sabotage, they are actually at odds, with many contradictions, forming the prototype of clashes between Chongqing troops and Communist troops. However, the activities of the Chinese Communist elements are more rampant, their conspiracy techniques are more insidious, and the extent of their sabotage is also more venomous. They penetrate every opening and exploit every avenue.</p>
<p>Third, the defeatists within the Peaceful Areas: These defeatists superficially engage in peace movements and stand on equal footing with the Chongqing and Communist elements. However, because they fundamentally lack conviction, oppose reform movements, and prioritize their own selfish interests, their psychology changes constantly, making them easily exploited by those plotting conspiracies and sabotage. As a result, they have the same impact as those who implement conspiracies and sabotage.</p>
<p>For the sake of building a new China and realizing the ideal of Greater East Asia co-prosperity, patriotic people who are struggling arduously, are facing the current decisive stage, surrounded by conspiracies and sabotage from all sides. Consequently, their work is becoming increasingly arduous, and the environment is becoming increasingly dangerous. However, building a new China and realizing the ideal of Greater East Asia co-prosperity has already become the only mission, for which there can be no turning back. Any arduous work, any dangerous environment, must be undertaken and confronted with a spirit of struggle. So, how should patriotic people struggle? We believe:</p>
<p>Maintain order in our steps, hold firm beliefs, and advance toward common goals. Adopt thorough precautions against conspiracies and sabotage from any side. Be neither fearful nor impetuous, neither suspicious nor rash, so as not to be exploited or divided.</p>
<p>Promote the reform movement. Strive for reform in government policies and social dynamics. Only with clear politics and social stability can conspiracies and sabotage find no opportunity to display their tricks and disappear without being eliminated. Therefore, the reform movement is the way to treat the root cause and nurture the source, and it must be vigorously promoted. Government authorities and social leaders especially must shoulder this responsibility.</p>
<p>Gather like-minded individuals to struggle for co-prosperity. Within the Peaceful Areas, we believe there are many patriotic people who aspire to build a new China and realize the ideal of Greater East Asia co-prosperity, but they must be brought together so that they do not disrupt their own ranks and give the enemy an opening.</p>
<p>Our present is the decisive stage, our surroundings are a dangerous environment, and we are already facing a critical juncture. Only by rousing the spirit of struggle amidst encirclement can we strive for final victory!</p>
<h3>Inauguration of the Agricultural Production Increase Conference - Vice President Zhou Delivers Admonition - Representatives from Various Provinces and Cities Report on Work Progress</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) – This year is the decisive year of the Greater East Asia War. The authorities are focusing on increasing agricultural production as the key task of this year's administration. A conference on increasing agricultural production in various provinces was specially convened today (the 9th) at the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association in Nanjing. The conference officially opened at 10:00 a.m., presided over by the Ministers of Industry, Food, and Construction in person. Attendees included responsible personnel from the Ministries of Industry, Food, and Construction, as well as central agricultural-related organizations, construction directors from various provinces and cities, heads of food bureaus, the Cooperative Enterprise Committee, chairmen of cooperatives from various regions, responsible personnel from the Business Unification Association and its lower-level institutions, representatives from the New People's Movement Association and its branches in various regions, and representatives from various influential agricultural organizations, totaling approximately two hundred people. Guests included Ye Peng (representing Du Kan), Lin Baisheng, Zhang Yipeng, Zhou Longxiang, Shen Erqiao, Li Ouyi, Dai Yingfu, Xue Fengyuan, Xi Zewen, Zhong Renchou, and the newly appointed economic advisor Dr. Nasu, among several dozen others. President Wang of the Executive Yuan specially appointed Vice President Zhou Fohai as his representative to attend and provide guidance. After the customary formalities, Chairman Gu Baoheng of the conference delivered the opening address, followed by an admonition from Vice President Zhou. The heartfelt words deeply moved all the representatives. After a speech by guest economic advisor Dr. Nasu, the opening ceremony of the conference concluded amidst military music. The entire group then took a commemorative photograph. It was also learned that the conference would continue at 3:00 p.m. Representatives from the Ministries of Food, Construction, and Industry, as well as representatives from various provinces and cities, would report on past work and future plans, and members of the proposal review committee would be nominated in groups.</p>
<p>Opening Address by Minister Gu</p>
<p>Today, the Ministries of Industry, Construction, and Food are jointly convening a conference on increasing agricultural production in various provinces and cities. Chief officials and technical personnel from construction bureaus, food bureaus, cooperatives, and the New People's Movement Association in various provinces and cities have traveled far to attend. High-ranking officials and advisors from allied nations have also graciously come to provide guidance. Furthermore, President [Wang] has dispatched Vice President Zhou as his representative to attend and provide admonition. The assembled representatives are all talented individuals gathered in one place. I am deeply honored and fortunate to have been elected chairman of this conference and to be present at this grand occasion. Since our country's participation in the war, a year has passed in an instant. The entire nation has been able to rise up in unison and work hard to advance the work in various sectors. Among these, increasing agricultural production is particularly important, as it relates to strengthening combat power and stabilizing people's livelihoods. In the past, all relevant parties have already made their greatest efforts to engage in this. In order to provide a reference for future improvements, the progress of the past must be reviewed. Furthermore, the various agricultural production increase plans for this year have been separately drafted by the responsible departments. In the implementation of these plans, the central government should certainly preside over the promotion. However, the relevant organs in various provinces and cities must also cooperate in order to achieve practical results. Now that the time for spring plowing is approaching, it is the most appropriate time to launch the production increase movement. Therefore, this conference has been convened to invite relevant organs from various provinces and cities to discuss together. The significance of this is self-evident. Increasing agricultural production covers a wide range. In order to achieve the goal of a high degree of production increase, there must be both a detailed and concrete plan and a complete organizational system to implement it. Both are equally important in order to promote action from top to bottom and to achieve a unified goal, so that the results can be significant. Based on my experience from past work, I feel that there are several matters that deserve attention for this year's production increase work. First, past production increase work has often focused on point facilities. This year, we should move towards widespread promotion in order to expand the area of production increase day by day. Second, in the past, production increase work has not always been consistent between the central government and local governments in terms of methods, and there has also been individual progress in some cases. This year, we should use a unified policy, concentrate our strength, and move forward together to implement the whole in a systematic way. Third, in the past, farmers were often passive in the guidance of agricultural improvement. This year, we should improve farmers' organizations and cultivate their habit of automatic improvement so that farmers become the backbone of production increase work. These three points are just my feelings from my work. All of you who are attending are personnel who are actually engaged in production increase work, and your understanding must be more accurate and clear. I hope that you will discuss them carefully based on your knowledge and experience, as well as the situation in each locality. I also hope that after the meeting, you will strive to promote the increase in agricultural production based on the resolutions. The future is very fortunate.</p>
<p>Admonition by Vice President Zhou</p>
<p>Today is the opening of the conference on increasing agricultural production in various provinces and cities. The Chairman attaches great importance to this conference, so he has instructed me to say a few words on his behalf. Since China's participation in the war, it has established economic principles, with two goals: one is to ensure military needs, and the other is to stabilize people's livelihoods. All of the government's economic measures are also aimed at these two goals. Speaking of stabilizing people's livelihoods, the people must have sufficient food and clothing. If we want the people to have sufficient food and clothing, we must increase agricultural production. Speaking of ensuring military needs, the Greater East Asia War is currently in full swing, and the future victory will depend on the length of support from military and economic forces. From this perspective, economic production is the foundation for obtaining victory. Since the government's participation in the war, because the military construction work has not yet been completed, it is still unable to fight alongside the allied forces. However, we can devote ourselves to increasing production in order to achieve the two major goals of stabilizing people's livelihoods and ensuring military needs. In a state of war, although governments of all countries are working hard to stabilize people's livelihoods, the people still feel pain. This is true not only for belligerent countries, but also for neutral countries. Although we cannot eliminate the suffering of people's livelihoods, we should at least reduce the suffering of people's livelihoods. As for how to enable the people to have sufficient food and clothing in order to stabilize people's livelihoods and ensure military needs, it is to implement agricultural production increase, that is, to increase agricultural production. Minister Gu has already given a clear explanation on the principles of implementation, that is, to promote the work from point to area and to strengthen the vertical and horizontal connections. In addition, I also have two points of opinion to contribute to you all. The issue of funding. The amount of funding is certainly a major key, but its ability to exert a great effect also depends on how we use it. We should do our best to research how to use a small amount of money to exert a great effect. I hope you will pay more attention to research on this point. Implement diligently. If a government has already established a plan to increase production, it should strive to implement it. If it is only perfunctory to the top and promotes to the bottom, deceiving oneself and others, it will be useless. In particular, increasing agricultural production is not like other work. It should be implemented diligently, without the slightest carelessness. If you can strive to implement it, you will be able to draw a new era in the agricultural history of China and Japan, and you will not fail the government's hopes and the people's demands.</p>
<p>Speech by Advisor Nasu</p>
<p>The government's three major policies for this year are the rectification of thought, the safeguarding of public security, and the increase in production, because these are the major problems at present. These three major problems are interlinked in an organic and close way. Under the leadership of Chairman Wang, efforts must be made to promote them in order to achieve the goal. At the same time, the issue of increasing production has much to do with cooperation in the Greater East Asia War. Today is the anniversary of China's participation in the war. It is of great significance to hold a conference on increasing agricultural production at this time. It is very difficult to implement the work of increasing agricultural production, especially in China's special wartime situation. To eliminate these difficulties, it is not a simple agricultural foundation or improvement problem. It must be done in the economy, prices, public security, as well as agricultural technology, farmer's knowledge, and other aspects, with thorough measures. In particular, farmers must deeply understand the meaning of increasing agricultural production in order to complete it. Therefore, in order to promote the work of increasing agricultural production, in addition to the full contact of various departments of the central government, it is hoped that all the representatives present will try to make every farmer deeply understand the meaning of increasing agricultural production and be happy to accept the guidance of the government authorities, so that the promotion of production increase work can be achieved with half the effort and twice the result.</p>

<h3>The Executive Yuan to Convene a Countryside Pacification Conference Today - More Than Twenty Proposals Have Been Received</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) – Since the Greater East Asia War has entered the decisive stage, the work of pacifying the countryside has become increasingly important for the sake of cooperating in completing the war objectives. Since the resolution of the Supreme National Defense Conference on May 20 of last year to transfer the affairs of countryside pacification to the unified handling of the Executive Yuan, the work of countryside pacification in various regions has progressed actively. Now, in order to review the past work of countryside pacification and establish future plans, the Executive Yuan has decided to convene a countryside pacification conference on the 10th of this month. In addition to the chief officials of the various departments in Nanjing who will attend and participate on time, the mayors of various provinces and cities, the directors of the countryside pacification bureaus of various provinces and cities, the heads of blockade management offices, and the countryside pacification inspectors have all arrived in Nanjing one after another to report. More than twenty proposals have been received. The conference is scheduled to begin at 3:00 p.m. on the 10th. After the mayors of various provinces and cities and the working units report on the general situation of their work, the discussion will begin. Important issues concerning countryside pacification administration, military affairs, culture, economy, construction, finance, and other aspects will be discussed and resolved. Its significance is extremely important.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) – Since the central government launched the work of countryside pacification in June of the 30th year of the Republic [1941], the Countryside Pacification Committee was subsequently established. In July of the same year, the work of countryside pacification began in the Suzhou area. Since then, it has been gradually promoted to the southeastern area of Taihu Lake and Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Shanghai, Zhenjiang, Nantong, and Anhui provinces. In terms of manpower training and material mobilization, the countryside pacification area has become a model area under the rule of the National Government. The development and success of countryside pacification work is related to the future of peace and national construction. Since the National Government's participation in the war, it has assumed the important task of consolidating the rear base of operations. The work of countryside pacification now has more than two years of history. In order to review the past and plan for the future, so that the work of countryside pacification becomes more substantive and strives for smooth and lively operation, the Executive Yuan has convened this conference of provincial and municipal officials and local countryside pacification personnel to discuss and establish a grand plan for countryside pacification in the future. This move is extremely important. The main purpose of countryside pacification is to enable the political power of the National Government to extend to the countryside, and its specific outline is to rectify thought, establish public security, and improve people's livelihoods. The holding of the countryside pacification conference is to seek the concrete realization of this outline, to establish a new Chinese system of construction from the grassroots level, and to contribute more manpower and material resources to the Greater East Asia liberation war. Therefore, the holding of this countryside pacification conference is of great significance.</p>

<h3>Japanese Army is Vigorously Attacking on All Fronts of the Myanmar Border - Occupied Enemy Position on the Northern Highlands of Na Kahn</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from a certain base on the Myanmar front, the battle situation of the Japanese army on the southern India-Myanmar border continues to progress smoothly. The Japanese army is now vigorously attacking on all fronts, overcoming the difficulties of dense forests and wetlands, and advancing rapidly in the Mayu mountain range. The British and Indian troops are unable to withstand the attacks and have continued to retreat towards the Naf River. The battle situation on the evening of the 7th was as follows: A part of the enemy army was covering the retreat of the main force of the enemy army in the Bukitong and Mayu River areas in the northeast highlands of Nagihokou and the northwest highlands of Xiunuo. The Japanese army launched a fierce attack from several directions and is now advancing towards a certain place, hoping to cut off the retreat route of the enemy's motor vehicle units. On the evening of the 7th, they occupied the enemy position on the northern highlands of Na Kahn.</p>
<p>Colonel Nakajima Explains the War Situation</p>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – Colonel Masami Nakajima of the Southern Army Headquarters of the Japanese Army, stationed in the Southern Army Headquarters, met with a group of reporters on the 9th to explain the recent war situation on the India-Myanmar border and pointed out the enemy's poor strategy, saying: According to the announcement of the Japanese General Headquarters on the 7th, the Japanese army unit on the southern India-Myanmar border launched an offensive against the 16th Corps of the British and Indian army that attacked the Japanese army's forward position on the 4th. In just a few dozen hours, it captured [Yi], and then advanced towards [De Dun] and [Jing Xi]. The army wants to attack Myanmar, but what I saw was that the Jing army turned to counterattack and unfolded an encirclement formation, which was a complete mess. On the 7th, the Mountbatten Command announced the war situation, saying: The Japanese army broke through the cordon and estimated the lead [Dunba Zhaer], tempting the scouts. However, it is not the fault of the scouts that the cordon was broken, but the foolish commanders who were ignorant of the strategic actions of the Japanese army and dreamed of attacking Myanmar should be fully responsible. The enemy army attempted to recapture Myanmar, and had planned three times, changed its timing three times, and changed its location three times, but all were frustrated and did not gain any achievement. The reason for their repeated defeats is that the strategic attacks were poorly executed, especially the British, who were self-important and had no feasible strategy. In the first Arakan operation, the main force of the enemy army was contained by the Japanese army units, while the Japanese army's mobile units circled to its rear and completed a large encirclement within two months, completely annihilating approximately 40,000 British and Indian troops of the 14th Division and the 8th Brigade. In the second Nujiang operation, the Yu army was active on the west bank of the Nujiang River and took the opportunity to attack northern Myanmar. The Japanese army's surprise attack was successful. The enemy's attempt to recapture Myanmar was abandoned halfway. This was because the British and American military leaders did not abide by the agreement of simultaneous attacks and planned to use the Yu army alone. Chen Cheng, the commander of the Yu army's dispatched army, resigned as a result. In the third Gongfu operation, the Yu army was still the main force, and the cunning British, in view of their previous failure, specially added the name of an American-style trained unit to the combat troops, so that American officers could command, in an attempt to avoid the responsibility for defeat. In this campaign, the Yu army was severely defeated by the Japanese army and wandered in the shady areas of the Gongfu Valley, just like stray dogs. Since Mountbatten took office, he has explained the reason why the operation to recapture Myanmar has been slow to progress, sometimes blaming the heavy rain season and sometimes blaming the dry season. In the face of the prestige of the Japanese army, Mountbatten has become a "seasonal wind" general. This time, he plans to attack [Mengduo]. I don't know what this "seasonal wind" general thinks, or whether he imagines that he can recapture Myanmar by attacking [Mengduo], but in reality, nearly 20,000 British and Indian attacking troops have been trapped in the Japanese army's encirclement in a few hours, and there is a great tendency to repeat the Arakan tragedy. If the British army's [Huai] attack this time is a superficial response to the Yu army, then the cunning British will probably suffer a great sacrifice again. Moreover, on the flanks of the swift Japanese army, there is also the Indian National Army, glaring and holding guns, fighting together. To pick on [Mengduo], it is fortunate if the attack does not turn into the nightmare of Chittagong.</p>
<h3>Japanese Naval Air Squadron Attacks Magas Corner - Bombs Enemy Airfields and Transport Ships</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese army base in the South Pacific, a Japanese naval air squadron bombed enemy forces in the Magas Corner area on the morning of the 7th, destroying one of their barges.

On the morning of the 8th, it bombed enemy boat groups in the Magas Corner area and attacked enemy transport convoys near Buna on New Guinea Island. One of its large transport ships was set on fire after being bombed. All Japanese aircraft returned to their bases.</p>
<h3>Bose Congratulates Indian Army Commander</h3>
<p>Yangon, 9th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese army base on the Myanmar front, Bose, the Supreme Commander of the Indian National Army, congratulated the commander of the Indian National Army on the Arakan front on the 8th. The text is as follows: The Indian National Army and I are deeply honored and grateful for the battle results obtained by the troops under your command on the Arakan front. I am sure that Indians around the world with patriotic enthusiasm will definitely feel boundless excitement. I hereby send this telegram to congratulate you and pray that you will forward it to all the officers and soldiers under your command.</p>

Although the Finnish people inevitably suffer from material losses, it is impossible to influence the Finnish people's will to fight through threats."</p>
<p>Stockholm, 9th (Central News Agency) - When the Finnish capital, Helsinki, was bombed by Soviet planes on the night of the 6th, all communication lines were cut off, so the details only reached here on the 8th. It is said that there were 150 to 180 bombers in this air raid, killing 38 civilians and injuring 232. It is reported that women have begun to evacuate the area, and the fires caused by the bombing had not been extinguished by the morning of the 7th.</p>
<p>America Makes Demands to Finland</p>
<p>Helsinki, 9th (Central News Agency) - A German News Agency report: The local information bureau issued an official statement today, confirming rumors that U.S. Secretary of State Hull has, through the U.S. Minister to Finland, made new demands to the Finnish government. The statement did not reveal the nature of the new demands.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 9th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Washington: U.S. Secretary of State Hull stated on the 8th that the U.S. government is exerting diplomatic pressure on Finland to force it to withdraw from the war. However, the Finnish Embassy in the United States stated in response to the statement that the country has no intention of withdrawing from the war, saying: "Finland's position has not changed in any way. Even if the capital is reduced to ashes, Finland will not change its attitude."</p>
<h3>Britain and the French Committee of National Liberation Sign Financial Agreement</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 9th (Central News Agency) - According to a London dispatch, British Chancellor of the Exchequer Anderson announced in the House of Commons yesterday that the British government has signed two agreements with the French Committee of National Liberation in Algiers. The first agreement stipulates an exchange rate of 200 French francs to one pound sterling, which will take effect immediately in the territory under the jurisdiction of the Algiers Committee. The second is a standard mutual assistance agreement, in which both sides will provide each other with essential war materials free of charge. The group is separate from the so-called Sterling Area, and payments for exports from these areas must be made in the local legal currency or from pound sterling deposits from French imports.</p>
<h3>Soviet Decentralization Plan Attracts Attention in Berlin</h3>
<p>Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - A German News Agency report, according to TASS, the appointment of Ponomarenko as Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of Belarus has attracted attention in Berlin political circles. Mr. Ponomarenko is currently the First Secretary of the Belarusian Communist Party, and Mr. Khrushchev, Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Ukrainian Oblast, also holds the same position in that oblast. This shows that the so-called decentralization plan orchestrated by Stalin is a trick, that the Soviet government is not actually implementing decentralization, but is merely using the help of the Communist Party to establish a closer link between the various republics and the Kremlin.</p>
<h3>German Troops in Nikopol Conduct Strategic Withdrawal; Fighting Particularly Fierce on the Southern Front</h3>
<p>Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency, according to a statement from the German Führer's Headquarters: The German troops, with an exemplary fighting spirit, have fiercely engaged in intense offensive and defensive battles in the Nikopol-Cherkasy area, west of, east of Scheshigov, east of Berislav, west and south of Lake Ilmen, and in the Luga sector, repelling powerful Soviet offensives and thwarting their attempts to break through. Local indentations in the German lines have either been filled or closed off. After destroying military installations and wartime industries, the German troops have carried out a planned withdrawal from the Nikopol bridgehead.</p>
<p>Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency: On Sunday, German troops continued their action to shorten and improve the lines of defense along the lower reaches of the Dnieper River, without encountering significant resistance from the enemy. There was also large-scale fighting for a time southeast of Krivoy Rog, where German mechanized units, disregarding stubborn Soviet resistance and constant attacks, pushed their own lines forward several kilometers. Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency: After the situation on the northern sector of the Eastern Front temporarily fell into a stalemate, the two focal points of the Soviet offensive on the southern front became intense. The Soviet army concentrated large forces to fiercely attack the German positions in the Nikopol and Kirovograd-Belaya Tserkov area. The weather on the eastern front has changed slightly, but it is still extremely cold, and the main battlefield is still full of mud and thunderstorms. The German forces in the Nikopol bridgehead are under intense Soviet attacks, especially the pressure from the north is the strongest. There was an unprecedented fierce battle northwest of Nikopol, and the German troops launched a fierce counterattack, inflicting heavy casualties on the Soviet army. The area between Kirovograd and Belaya Tserkov is the second focal point on the southern front. In order to prevent German counterattacks, the Soviet army is now increasing its pressure and continuing to attack the German troops. The German army has dispatched powerful mechanized units to engage in a heroic bayonet charge, and the battle lines are in a chaotic state. German mechanized units in the Polonnoye district launched a fierce counterattack to the west of the area, seemingly to control the Soviet offensive on the bend of the Dnieper River through a flanking attack. The true situation is still unclear. West of the former Polish border, fierce fighting is still continuing in the Rovno and Lutsk areas. If the Soviet army increases the pressure, the German army will use retreat tactics to conserve manpower.</p>
<h3>British Commonwealth Conference Scheduled for This Spring</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 9th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Cape Town: South African Prime Minister Field Marshal Smuts will travel to London in the spring to attend a conference of leaders of the Commonwealth. During Mr. Smuts' absence from South Africa, Mr. Hofmeyr will serve as Acting Prime Minister.</p>
<h3>Germany Uses "Wild Boar" Fighter Planes; Incomparable Night Air Defense Power</h3>
<p>Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - According to Hai Tong News Agency: The German single-engine night fighter, designed by Colonel Herrmann, began to be used in combat last autumn and is called "Herrmann's Fighter" or "Wild Boar" in aviation circles. Last summer, British planes repeatedly concentrated on bombing German cities. Colonel Herrmann suggested responding with a large number of single-seat fighters, which was first used on a large scale in Hamburg. The large-scale British air raids on Berlin in August and September of last year were also weakened by the heavy strikes of this night fighter. This fighter is modeled after the Messerschmitt 109 and Focke-Wulf 190. Its pilots must undergo rigorous training, as takeoff and landing at night are very dangerous, and the winter weather is also a hindrance to single-seat fighters, due to the lack of the blind flying and other advantages of twin-engine fighters.</p>
<h3>Germany Launches Counteroffensive Towards Anzio-Nettuno Bridgehead; Allied Forces in Peril</h3>
<p>Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency, military news: German troops in the Apulia sector of southern Italy have recently launched an offensive from the west, north, and northeast towards the Allied Anzio-Nettuno bridgehead. German troops have broken through enemy lines in several places and reached the designated target area.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 9th (Central News Agency) - Allied forces are actively strengthening their forces in the Anzio-Nettuno bridgehead. A United Press military reporter frankly admitted on the 8th the plight of the Allied forces, saying that Allied infantry and tank units launched a desperate defensive battle on the road from Anzio to Apulia on the 7th, because if that road were to fall, the entire bridgehead would be in danger. Several key locations in this narrow bridgehead have been occupied by German troops, and German artillery units have advanced to fiercely attack the landing sites. The Allied forces have engaged in hand-to-hand combat.</p>
<p>Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - German authorities announced on the 8th: The Allied forces in the Nettuno bridgehead have been on the defensive for several days. The fierce bombardment by German long-range artillery has made a great contribution to containing the enemy forces. The German Air Force bombed and burned an enemy transport ship and several fuel depots in Nettuno, and also destroyed four enemy merchant ships totaling 14,000 tons. Northwest of Cassino, the U.S. Fifth Army is reorganizing its positions. Mines have been laid at the mouth of the Garigliano River, indicating that the enemy has no intention of advancing at this time, but is concentrating on defense.</p>
<p>Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - According to Hai Tong News Agency: The British 56th Infantry Division, which had been providing distant support behind the U.S. Fifth Army, has suddenly rushed to the Nettuno bridgehead, indicating that the Allied forces in Nettuno and Anzio have been trapped in a desperate situation. In fact, a large part of this Allied defeat can be attributed to the German heavy artillery and long-range artillery fiercely attacking the Allied concentration points and ships outside the ports of both locations. The German "foothills strategy" has also been effective, because the heavy artillery is positioned in the mountains surrounding the plains of both locations, providing natural protection, and can gradually increase its power without being affected by Allied artillery fire.</p>
<h3>U.S. Tax Revenue Doubles in Fiscal Year 1943</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 9th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Washington: The U.S. Treasury Department announced on the 8th that the total federal tax revenue for 1943 reached $31.93453 billion, about double that of the previous year.</p>
<h3>U.S. and Canada Negotiate Customs Union</h3>
<p>Geneva, 9th (Central News Agency) - The Manchester Guardian reports: Negotiations for a U.S.-Canada customs union have begun. Canadian Foreign Trade Representative Robertson is currently in Washington negotiating this matter with U.S. authorities. The plan is to reduce tariffs by 10 percent each year, so that tariffs between the two countries can be completely eliminated after ten years.</p>
<h3>Rice in South Borneo to Be Freely Traded</h3>
<p>Malaya, 9th (Central News Agency) - South Borneo has prohibited the free sale of rice since August of last year. The local authorities, in view of the fact that the predetermined rice storage target has been successfully achieved, have allowed free sale since the 7th.</p>
<h3>British-Turkish Negotiations at a Stalemate</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 9th (Central News Agency) - According to a report by the London News Chronicle correspondent in Ankara, Jordan: The continuous negotiations between the Allied forces and Turkey since the Cairo Conference have recently ended. Mr. Jordan emphasized that although these negotiations were held in an atmosphere of private friendship and goodwill, they still did not conceal the serious disputes between the British and American authorities. The point of contention is not that Turkey disagrees with its responsibilities under the 1939 treaty, but that Turkey believes that it should be clearly informed of all points before fulfilling the terms of the treaty.</p>
<h3>The Siege and Defense of European Fortresses (II) Asahi Shimbun Roundtable Discussion</h3>
<p>Special Correspondent Imai (Argentina, Capital) (Dispatch before the severance of relations) I also thought that the Anglo-American advance into Europe would choose the English Channel and attack from the front. Why are they so late to advance? They have learned from the experience of the Italian campaign that they cannot defeat Germany unless they defeat the German army on the main battlefield. The only battlefields where the Allied forces can fully use their mechanized units and armored forces are northern France and the Low Countries; other areas such as the Balkans, Italy, and southern France are treacherous mountainous areas, isolated from the central part of the European continent.</p>
<p>On the other hand, landing in Norway is not very convenient either. Moreover, the Allied forces believe that if they invade Norway, it will simultaneously cause the Soviet Union to invade Finland and force Sweden to lean towards the Axis. So the only remaining route is to attack Europe from the side of the East? Or attack from the West?</p>
<p>A certain German military expert observed that the Allied forces will transport two or three million troops to the Soviet Union to launch a major offensive against Germany from the east with combined forces. But the Allied conclusion is that invading from the English Channel, although there are difficulties in the initial landing, is the only way. The supply line from the English Channel is the shortest, and fighter planes can also be easily dispatched. As for the timing, it will be around the end of spring. If it is delayed any further, Roosevelt's four-term issue will become a problem, and this time is the best season for weather conditions in the English Channel. Before this, the Allied forces will use the short nights and long days of winter and early spring to weaken the German defenses as much as possible through continuous large-scale strategic bombing, and at the same time engage in large-scale amphibious warfare preparations with all their strength.</p>
<p>Special Correspondent Ito (Madrid) A European landing is about to be realized soon. Judging from the domestic situation in Britain and the United States, it will inevitably be a reality this year. The Tehran Conference organized a headquarters for operations in Europe, and frequently announced that it would be between the end of the year and January, but now it is said to be May. Of course, many empty ships have gathered on the British coast, and escort ships are frequently traveling east from Gibraltar. Moreover, a large army has also gathered in Corsica, ready to go. General observation is that if they cannot land in January, they will land in late April or early May.</p>
<p>The winter on the Eastern Front ends in mid-March, and the snow melts in April, making it impossible to fight. This timing is in line with the Eastern Front. Moreover, the winter weather in the English Channel is not good, and it is not suitable for air combat and the advance of the landing forces' tanks. Secondly, when it comes to the question of where to land, there are no miracles in war. From a common-sense perspective, the first to be defended is the coast of northern France, Belgium, and Holland. There is also considerable support for the idea of landing in Norway with air cover for the transport ships, and for the idea of gathering troops in Corsica to land in southern France and the Balkans.</p>
<p>Special Correspondent Mogi (Lisbon) There are also many observations here about around May. The second front in Italy will move in sync with the Soviet offensive. In mid-March, the snow will begin to melt in the Eastern Front area, and the Soviet offensive will temporarily come to a halt or slow down at the end of April, when the campaign is completed. If the Allied forces must start the second front in mid-February, the Soviet Union will not be ready, so it is expected to be in early May. Of course, the Allied forces will choose the timing and location to minimize the sacrifices of the second front. The point they fear most is that the German forces on the Eastern Front and especially those within it will turn to defend the second front. So they will wait for the most tense period on the Eastern Front, and the location will be chosen to start simultaneously in several places.</p>
<p>The Atlantic coast of Germany, France, Holland, and Belgium, the border area of Spain and France, or the coasts of the Adriatic Sea, Yugoslavia, and Greece will all be launched simultaneously in a short period of time. According to observations from neutral countries, the Allied forces are currently preparing the 5 million tons of shipping needed to operate 50 divisions in the English Channel.

<h3>Army Press Department Announces Recent War Situation: Burma and Pacific Areas</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report: The regular press conference hosted by the Army Press Department in Shanghai was held yesterday at 3 PM on the eighth floor of the Cathay Hotel on the Bund, Nanjing Road. Lieutenant Sakamoto and Mr. Akahoshi from the department attended. During the conference, the spokesperson reported in detail on the war situation in Burma and the Pacific. The main points of the announcement are as follows:</p>
<p>Recent War Situation in Burma</p>
<p>"The Allied counteroffensive against Japan is intensifying, and the Greater East Asia War has entered a decisive stage. In the Pacific, the enemy (the US) has broken through the outer defense line of the Japanese army and is directly attacking the Marshall Islands. The war situation in Burma is also gradually maturing. On February 4th, the Japanese army first thwarted the enemy and began an offensive. The elite troops of the Free Indian National Army, who have long awaited the opportunity to advance on their homeland, have also joined the battle. In close coordination with the Japanese army, they are repelling the enemy everywhere and continuing their advance. This is truly the first step for the Free Indian Government to advance on New Delhi and is of great significance. Regarding the Allied counteroffensive in Burma, the US and Britain have exaggerated their claims for a long time. Now it has been more than three months, and the rainy season is about to return, but they have still not formally begun the counteroffensive. The US has explained the reason for this delay, saying that it is not due to the delay in General Mountbatten's operational plans, but mainly because the handover between Mountbatten and Wavell took unexpectedly long, and it is also difficult to replenish military supplies to India. This explanation from the US is completely contrary to their propaganda about the increasingly active counteroffensive in Burma. Currently, the area where enemy activity is seen in Burma is the Ma Yu Peninsula, the Buthidaung front. The main force of the British 14th Army, with the British Indian Army as the vanguard, is advancing from that direction towards Maungdaw and Buthidaung north of Hrikhi. At the same time, the Chongqing army is attempting to attack in the Hukawng Valley. However, the Japanese army began attacking the enemy on the 4th, and with the cooperation of the Japanese air force and ground troops, they shattered the enemy's activity. It is expected that the enemy will face a second Arakan tragedy. In addition, the Burmese Expeditionary Force commanded by Wei Lihuang has been active in northern Burma. However, because this army suffered a major blow during the Japanese army's Yunnan offensive, it currently shows no signs of activity.</p>
<p>Purpose of Allied Incursion into the Marshall Islands</p>
<p>As for the purpose of the Allied forces using naval mobile units to break into the Japanese army's inner defense area of the Marshall Islands, there are generally four: 1. The defenses of New Britain and Rabaul are too strong, resulting in extremely high losses for enemy aircraft. The enemy believes that it would be difficult to attack those areas, so they changed their plan and advanced from the Gilbert Islands to the Marshall Islands, isolating the Japanese southwestern Pacific base. 2. The Allies aim to attack the Japanese naval base of Truk or the Ogasawara Islands after capturing the Marshall Islands, so as to directly attack the Japanese mainland. 3. On the other hand, they aim to cut off the transportation lines between the southern Japanese-occupied resource areas and the Japanese mainland, causing the Japanese army to run out of resources. 4. A psychological warfare tactic against the Axis powers, aimed at making propaganda more favorable, and politically preparing Roosevelt to win the presidential election in the US. All of the above goals are considered reckless on the part of the enemy, which shows their anxiety about the war situation. At the same time, the timing is very favorable for Japan to develop southern resources and increase aircraft production. Therefore, the enemy, aware of this, is trying to conquer Japan now to avoid losing the opportunity forever, otherwise, the US itself will be in crisis. As for defeating the Allied forces, it is definitely not easy to achieve. During the course of the war to achieve final victory, we must be prepared for even greater situations and have a defensive mindset. The Allies have recently launched frequent propaganda campaigns during their counteroffensive, attempting to disrupt thinking, which is the so-called psychological warfare tactic. For example, they fabricate stories of the Japanese army mistreating enemy prisoners or Japan's production weakening, or exaggerate the war results they have achieved, all in an attempt to disrupt the morale of the Axis countries. These are all means for them to hide their own weaknesses. For example, the Allied forces illegally bombed the Japanese Red Cross ship Venosta, which is one example.</p>
<p>We have fully seen the true face of the Americans, who have shed their mask of benevolence and morality, in this Greater East Asia War. However, we must be wary of the psychology of some Shanghai residents who have been dominated by or dependent on the US and Britain in the past.</p>
<h3>Economy Association Second Board Meeting</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Economy Association held its second plenary board meeting at its headquarters at 160 Great Shanghai Road yesterday (9th) at 4:45 PM. Attendees included Jin Zongcheng, Lu Feng (represented by Ren Yunpeng), Zheng Weixian, Chen Dongbai, Chen Binhe, Chen Fukang, Chen Zhengzhang, Chen Jiufeng, Chen Linsheng, Cheng Zhiliang, Xu Liqiu (represented by Jiang Yunzhang), Wang Ping, Ren Yunpeng, Xu Yiqing, Wan Xuefang, Yan Yongxiao, Huang Jingwan, Wu Xiaohou, Zhang Yongding, Yang Zuo, and dozens of others. The meeting was chaired by Vice Chairman Jin Zongcheng, and many proposals were discussed. The directors elaborated on their opinions on promoting economy in detail. They will negotiate with the relevant authorities in the coming days in order to thoroughly implement economy and contribute to the country and society. The meeting adjourned at 6 PM.</p>
<h3>Colonel Tsuji Masanobu of the Japanese Army Speaks: "An Announcement to Japanese Residents"</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report: Colonel Tsuji Masanobu of the General Headquarters of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China, at the invitation of the Asia Press Congress, gave a speech entitled "An Announcement to Japanese Residents" at the Shanghai International Theater from 4 PM to 6 PM on the 8th, the anniversary of Japan's declaration of war against Britain and the US. Based on his own experience, Colonel Tsuji explained that aircraft are as important as the loyalty and courage of the Japanese army in the southern operations. He also strongly stated that if the Chinese and Japanese nations can closely cooperate, they will have nothing to fear even if they are opposed to Britain, the US, and the entire world. Colonel Tsuji elaborated on how to resolve the Sino-Japanese War, hoping that Japanese residents will cooperate with the new policies. The main points are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>The Entire Nation Must Embrace This Determination</p>
<p>The future of the war is becoming increasingly fierce. Recently, we have heard reports that the enemy has landed in the Marshall Islands and occupied the Gilbert Islands, or that the Kuril Islands have been bombed, giving people the feeling of losing an island in the morning and another in the evening, causing anxiety. However, this view is extremely wrong. If we judge from a strategic standpoint, the closer the battlefield is to our country, the greater the losses the enemy will suffer, and the easier the operation will be. In order to complete the Greater East Asia War, I am convinced that a million people must be sacrificed, but this great sacrifice should be endured. If we defeat millions of enemy soldiers, then the sacrifice of a million will still be worthwhile. The result of the war is undoubtedly that any nation that has the thought of failure will surely fail. If we encounter any difficulties, we must always maintain our determination to win, and we will ultimately defeat the enemy. The Russo-Japanese War was a war for survival and self-defense. This Greater East Asia War is a war for the liberation of all of East Asia from the oppression of Britain and the US. We must be aware that the Greater East Asia War is ten times greater than the Russo-Japanese War. If the entire nation has this determination, the Greater East Asia War will be resolved. The enemy invariably fights for itself in any war, taking the opportunity to encroach on East Asian land. Now, our one billion colored people have reached a time to rise up as a collective. We must not rely on the strength of others, but only seek our own, taking Japan as the center and uniting with allied countries to work together. The national borders of East Asia are adjacent to each other; this is destiny, a fate bestowed by Heaven.</p>
<p>With Sino-Japanese Cooperation, the World Will Be Unbeatable</p>
<p>I have fought in various places in the past. The first time was in the Jiangwan Town, fighting against Cai Tingkai's 19th Route Army. Later, I fought with the Chongqing's Central Army in Shanxi, with the Soviet Army in Nomonhan, with the British Army in Malaya, with the American and Filipino forces on the Bataan Peninsula, and with the American and Australian forces in the Solomon Islands. Based on my experience, the strongest is the Chinese army. This conclusion may seem incredible to you, but with the same equipment and on the same battlefield against the enemy, the Chinese Central Army is the strongest, followed by the Soviet Army. This is because the blood of the Soviet Army also contains some Eastern blood. Below them are the US, Britain, and Australia. If a strong China and an even stronger Japan shake hands, then the world will be unbeatable; this can be asserted.</p>
<p>Cooperation with China Is the Only Way to Exist</p>
<p>The Greater East Asia War has now entered a decisive stage. In the midst of this war, Japan has expressed a new policy towards China. This so-called policy means that Japan has recognized China and the world after six years of war and believes that Japan can only exist by cooperating with China and advancing together. At the same time, this is the only way to be in line with the great purpose of the war. This policy is the grace of His Majesty the Emperor. If we can mutually practice this grace, then the Sino-Japanese War can be resolved quickly. If the millions of military officers and civilians in China can regard millions of Chinese comrades as true comrades, then the incident can be said to have been resolved long ago. The Chongqing side is currently watching the situation in Shanghai and observing whether Japan's new policies are genuine. Only by practicing this new policy can the incident be resolved. The resolution of the Greater East Asia War hinges on the handling of the Sino-Japanese War. At the same time, the 100,000 Japanese residents in Shanghai hold the key to resolving the incident.</p>
<p>Offering Sacrifices at Chiang's Mother's Grave with a Sense of Morality</p>
<p>When I went to Ningbo and Fenghua in eastern Zhejiang on the 25th of May, I followed the order of the Japanese army commander to offer sacrifices to the spirit of Chiang Kai-shek's mother, who had been forgotten for seven or eight years due to the war. I, along with a lieutenant general appointed by Chairman Wang Jingwei, prepared a very large wreath in Shanghai and went there together by plane. At that time, in Fenghua, which was located between the Japanese army and the Chongqing army, we gathered the Chinese people and said that Chiang Kai-shek was an elite figure from your hometown, but now the grave of Chiang Kai-shek's mother has been neglected to such an extent, which is truly inappropriate. However, Japan is fighting for morality, so we have gathered both sides to worship together, lifted the security measures, and even invited 50 monks to hold a grand Buddhist ceremony for a week. At that time, relatives of the Chiang family who lived in the Chongqing-controlled area also came to worship together. They were sincerely grateful for this sense of morality from the Japanese side. I also told the local residents to please tell Mr. Chiang Kai-shek to rest assured and fight the war for five or ten years. During the war, the Japanese army will definitely guard the grave of Chiang Kai-shek's mother on his behalf. War and morality are fundamentally two different things, and we will defend it until the very last soldier. This is truly the morality of Japan. These words were neither a strategy nor a scheme, but truly came from the good intentions of the Japanese army commander.</p>
<p>Sincerely Practice Moral Principles</p>
<p>At this time when prices in Shanghai are soaring and life is difficult, I often hear that the various Baojia have made great achievements in contributing to aircraft and the military, for which I am truly grateful. At the same time, I often hear about many acts of charity and kindness in Shanghai. I have also talked with friends in Shanghai that if we treat others with sincerity, we will definitely have people follow us. However, what is regrettable is that some soldiers with authority and power still lack integrity. This point must be improved. In the current war situation, we must not be happy at one moment and worried at another. We must thoroughly understand the true meaning of the national essence and implement it with unwavering determination and a belief in victory. At the same time, when we implement the true Japanese spirit and morality, the Greater East Asia War can be brought to an end in China. Only in this way can we be the leader of East Asia. If we do not do what we should do, or act immorally, or insult and despise the Chinese people, then no one will follow Japan. Our goal is not to be the leader of East Asia; that is only a result. I hope that the 100,000 Japanese residents in Shanghai will sincerely practice morality. Your righteous actions will be reflected in Chongqing, which will then be reflected in the world. And I hope that everyone will work hard to complete the Greater East Asia War with the determination of a soldier who is ready to die.</p>

<h3>Mr. Zhou Youhai's Book "A General Overview of Japan" Published; Proceeds from Book Sales to Be Used for Scholarships</h3>
<p>Understanding Japan is an important topic at present. Unfortunately, to date, there are few monographs that provide a systematic and comprehensive introduction to the reality of Japan. Now, Mr. Zhou Youhai has written the book "A General Overview of Japan" to enlighten the people of our country. It can be said to be a timely read. Mr. Zhou has studied in Japan for many years and has a deep understanding, observation, and experience of Japan. Moreover, his writing style is unrestrained, his tone is cordial, his attitude is faithful, and his words come from the heart. Therefore, this book not only has no "stereotyped" or "moralistic" flavor, but also often uses interesting stories to express his views on Japan, allowing us to gain a realistic understanding of the reality of Japan. The content of the book is divided into ten chapters: 1. Preface; 2. The Special Nature of the Japanese Constitution; 3. Japanese Culture; 4. The Japanese Spirit; 5. Japanese Customs; 6. Japanese Society; 7. Japanese National Character; 8. The Attitude of Japanese People Towards Chinese People; 9. Japanese Opinions on Sino-Japanese Relations; 10. Conclusion. Most of the content is based on the latest materials, which makes it especially worth buying. The actual price per copy is 15 national currency. Now, in order to help impoverished students, Mr. Zhou has decided to use all the proceeds from the sale of the book as scholarships for the Shen Bao. Readers can not only read a book for a mere 15 yuan, but also help students. Why not do it? The publishing office of "A General Overview of Japan" is New Life Press, and the general sales offices are Gujin Publishing House and Shen Bao Guan.</p>

<h3>Exciting Saturday Boxing Matches; Futsuta Hisao to Fight Famous Bopoli Boxer</h3>
<p>This Saturday's boxing match at the Jai Alai Stadium features a wealth of talent, with no less than five title holders. Japanese star Futsuta Hisao, who recently defeated Bopoli Polini, is fierce and unstoppable. He is a promising contender for the Far East Welterweight Championship. Hanlan star Keda Tan will fight Futsuta Hisao for the Chinese Welterweight Championship and is highly anticipated. Veteran Pelechavi from Harbin, who defeated Far East Champion Sheraf and Chinese boxer Huang Naiji a few years ago, will fight former Japanese Welterweight Champion Motoyama Haruyoshi, which is very eye-catching. Former Japanese Lightweight Champion Arai San will fight overseas Chinese Zok Lelara, and it is difficult to predict the outcome. All of these fighters are famous figures in the boxing world who rarely cooperate easily. This great lineup is truly rare, so boxing fans are flocking to reserve seats.</p>

<h3>Commentary: A Second Discussion on the Agricultural Production Increase Conference</h3>
<p>On the 30th of last month, we discussed the agricultural production increase conference, believing that this year's production increase movement, regardless of the methods used to increase production, must adhere to a minimum goal: ensuring the domestic food supply. This is because the food problem, during wartime, can be said to be a factor determining military victory or defeat, and the hearts and minds of the people; it is no exaggeration.</p>
<p>Yesterday's opening of the National Agricultural Production Increase Conference in the capital, personally presided over by the three ministers of the Ministry of Food and Construction, fully demonstrates the sincerity and determination of the government authorities to promote agricultural production increase work. Speaking of methods to increase agricultural production, in summary, it comes down to expanding acreage, improving cultivation methods to increase yield, cultivating new varieties to improve quality, preventing and controlling disasters to reduce losses, operating large-scale farms, and utilizing machinery to reduce production costs. In addition, measures such as those in this year's Central China Production Increase Countermeasures, including well digging, expanding seed collection fields, adding agricultural technicians, allocating chemical fertilizers, providing facilities for preventing diseases and pests, and allocating and improving agricultural implements, can all serve as the basis for agricultural production increase plans.</p>
<p>The above all belong to the technical aspects. As for the financial aspect, it is particularly important to actively encourage and promote the release of loans to villages to facilitate agricultural production funds. At the same time, to prevent rural inflation, savings should be encouraged to absorb general floating funds. All of these, though only outlining the main points, are what we earnestly expect from the National Agricultural Production Increase Conference.</p>
<h3>Price Review Council: Unified Handling of Evaluation Matters; Central Market No Longer Executes Reviews</h3>
<p>Previously, the municipal government, in response to rising prices and the urgent need to find ways to curb them to stabilize the people's livelihood, had already instructed the Economic Bureau to establish a Price Review Council, placing the city's evaluation matters under the unified jurisdiction of the council to unify authority and assign special responsibility. Furthermore, the government has issued a general order to all trade associations and businesses that future price increases should be submitted to the Price Review Council for review. With Shanghai City Instruction No. 3, 15590, the Central Market is prohibited from executing reviews. The text of the instruction is copied below: "In view of the recent rise in prices, it is urgent to find ways to curb them, and price determination is the fundamental solution. It is inappropriate for the market to announce prices on its own. Now that the Economic Bureau has been approved to establish a Price Review Council, all evaluation matters in the city should be under the unified jurisdiction of the council to unify authority and assign special responsibility. The market director is also a member of the council. If they have any opinions, they can submit them for discussion and decision at the meeting. From the date of this order, the market shall no longer execute review matters. Also, if any businesses apply for price increases, the entire case should be submitted to the meeting for a decision to serve as the standard for implementation throughout the city. In addition to the separate notification to be issued by this government to all trade associations and businesses that future price increase matters should be submitted to the council, this order specifically prohibits the market from determining prices and to promptly submit the previously determined prices to the council for review and publication, otherwise it shall not be used as the basis for legal transactions. You are to comply and report on your compliance."</p>
<h3>Authorities Actively Planning: Adjusting Unified Allocation Mechanisms; Various Industries Hope for Increased Material Allocation</h3>
<p>The local authority in charge of wealth, in order to ensure that various industries obtain sufficient materials on schedule to maintain normal operations and achieve universal sales, is actively preparing plans to thoroughly adjust the unified allocation mechanisms. At the same time, the allocation dates and quantities will also be improved. Since the authorities implemented unified allocation, the general progress has been good. However, regarding the quantity of allocations, although various industry associations have repeatedly called for increases, they have not yet been approved by the authorities. Therefore, companies, factories, and businesses in various industries have had no choice but to limit production. For example, the members of the cotton ginning industry association mainly produce cotton batting and ginned cotton, but they have not yet been allocated the two raw materials of raw cotton and yarn, causing extreme difficulties in their operations. As for the various noodle-making businesses, although they have obtained two rounds of allocated flour, the quantity is too small to meet their needs. Therefore, they eagerly hope that the authority in charge of wealth can determine their grades based on the operational scope of each industry association and provide appropriate material allocations.</p>
<h3>Second Police Bureau Cracking Down: Exceeding Price Limits</h3>
<p>Since the Spring Festival, the city's money industry has adopted a tight lending policy to prevent hoarding and curb the rise in prices. It has been found that the prices of daily necessities have become active again, which directly and indirectly affects the people's livelihood. In order to effectively crack down on price increases in various industries, the Second Police Bureau has recently issued orders to its subordinate branches and district police stations to strictly crack down on any instances of businesses taking advantage of the situation to exceed price limits within their respective jurisdictions to stabilize the people's livelihood.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Stocks Initially Weak but Then Firm: Textile Stocks Alone See Resilience</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai stock market was still weak in the morning, but rebounded slightly in the afternoon, and the base was firmer than the previous evening's close. As a result, stocks in various industries still saw mixed gains and losses. Many textile stocks were popular, such as Tung Yih, Ta Kung, Kung Sheng, Ta Tung, and Yee Ta, which all saw gains, while Mei Ya, Hsin Ho, and Ta Tung were relatively flat.

In the cultural industry, Chin Feng Paper suddenly rose by 1.5 yuan, while China Film and bookstore stocks were soft. New pharmaceutical stocks were flat, chemical industry stocks mostly saw small gains, and real estate stocks Yung Hsing, Hsin Yih, and Kwok Wah all edged higher.

<h3>Business News Summary</h3>
<p>Government Bond Market Remains Flat and Weak: Yesterday's spot prices failed to continue to rise, indicating that the strength of the floating longs was limited. It is noted that in the afternoon session the previous day, spot prices had traded at 223.8, a further increase of 0.3 compared to the morning, with a very favorable trend, but yesterday it was impossible to push higher. One party of longs took the opportunity to sell, while the shorts were thus compelled to cover, resulting in unnecessary losses. The current trend is likely to be one of sideways trading with a weak undertone, due to pressure from substantial shorts on the one hand, and continued tight credit on the other hand, making it temporarily impossible to expand. Category C opened at 223.2, and rose to 223.5 but failed to break out above the previous day's closing price, and the market slowly declined, with low prices seen at 222.7. The noon close was 223, down 0.5 from the previous day. Other categories saw little movement. Category A saw no activity, Category B was at 166.8 to 166.7, Category D was at 166.5, and Category E was at 173, with mixed strength and weakness.</p>
<p>Interbank Lending Rate Barely Changes: Yesterday, the interbank lending rate announced by the Money Industry Association remained unchanged at 0.2.</p>
<p>Grain Prices Continue to Rise: Yesterday, due to continued scarcity of supply, holders were aggressively hoarding. Furthermore, some speculators took the opportunity to push prices up, leading to a uniform rise to higher peaks. Premium japonica rice even reached a high of 330, while thin indica rice was also above 300.</p>
<p>Edible Oil Market Also Firm: Yesterday, the edible oil market was also exceptionally firm, with raw soybean oil soaring to 835.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains and Soybeans Uniquely Expensive: Yesterday, miscellaneous grains were scarce and therefore expensive, with prices rising steadily. Taicang soybeans were 1,500 to 1,700, and corn was 1,000.</p>
<p>Cigarette Prices High, Sales Slow: Yesterday, there were quoted prices on the black market for cigarettes, but few transactions actually occurred due to high prices, leading to slow sales.</p>
<h3>Second Savings Week Decided to Extend One Week</h3>
<p>The Second Savings Week organized by the Central Reserve Bank of China in Shanghai City was held from January 17 to January 22 of this year. However, at that time, it coincided with the end of the lunar year when the money industry was busy collecting and transferring funds, so it was unable to fully accept savings deposits. Now, the Central Bank believes that the savings movement was originally to meet the needs of the people, so it has decided to extend it for one week from February 14 to February 19. Various banks and money shops will continue to accept time deposits with prizes for the Second Savings Week, so that the people have ample opportunity to participate. After the extension expires, the lottery will be held. Nanjing, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Bengbu and other places also held Savings Week concurrently with Shanghai, which have been successfully completed as scheduled, and the results are very satisfactory. The lottery will be drawn in Shanghai in the near future.</p>
<h3>Herbal Medicine Association Strictly Prohibits: Raising Selling Prices</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Herbal Medicine Association has recently issued a public notice to its members to strictly prohibit raising selling prices and affecting the people's livelihood. They must strictly comply with the original price limits set by the government authorities when selling, and must not raise prices privately, otherwise their goods will be sealed up pending disposal by the competent authorities and the responsible persons will be severely punished according to law.</p>

<h3>Student Number Four (6)</h3>
<p>April 1st, a sunny spring day. The young men who had been deemed acceptable for enrollment gathered at the school gate before 7:00 AM, and were assigned to their respective squads. Zhenren was assigned to the 16th squad together with Kumazawa.</p>
<p>The squad supervisor was a quiet S-Major who didn't have a beard. S-Major brought the new students to the bathhouse, and said as if in jest, "Wash away the dust of the mundane world!"</p>
<p>Zhenren wasn't very clear about the meaning of the term "mundane world".</p>
<p>After bathing, they had to change into new military uniforms. Thinking back to how much Longfu had admired these tailored short uniforms, a wave of sadness washed over him. After putting on the uniform, he discovered a problem with the pants, and said to Kumazawa beside him, "These pants, they don't have any pockets..."</p>
<p>The uniforms from the Second Middle School also had them, but this uniform didn't. That was to prohibit the vulgar and ugly appearance of putting hands in the pockets when it was cold, something that Zhenren didn't know yet.</p>
<p>"If you don't give up the dialect, you'll probably be laughed at," Kumazawa noticed this aspect instead.</p>
<p>The new students were then led from the bathhouse to the magnificent student hall. There, they found the study rooms for their respective squads. Unlike dormitories in ordinary schools, there were many desks like those used in classrooms. A beautiful wooden box was hung on the stand in the center of the front. Inside were the rosters of the squads.</p>
<p>They were then led to the bedrooms on the third floor. Very clean white blankets, folded very neatly, were laid out there. The bunks were placed on the blankets. They didn't know why there were blue lines on the white blankets. However, next to each person's bunk, there was a very sturdy box. When they opened it, they found all kinds of clothes. What he liked the most was that a short sword was placed on top of the clothes. Zhenren slightly drew out the short sword inlaid with gold trim when he hung it on his waist. It wasn't a toy... The brilliance of the sharp blade was dazzling. Moreover, when he heard the name of the iron box called "Chest," he thought of the similar Satsuma dialect and couldn't help but laugh.</p>
<p>Before long, they ate their first lunch in the mess hall here. It was curry rice. It tasted even better than the Western food in Kagoshima. He was truly impressed by the spaciousness of the dining hall and the elegant demeanor of the senior students.</p>
<p>At one o'clock in the afternoon, there was an entrance ceremony. Each person's oath was compiled and sent to the principal. The principal was a lieutenant general, wearing glasses, a kind and gentle-looking general. Next, he began to read out the imperial rescript granted to military personnel. Continuing with the reverence of the imperial portrait, he felt an indescribable sense of dignity in his heart. At this moment, Zhenren deeply felt that he was already a student of the Naval Academy.</p>
<p>The students of the Naval Academy are not ordinary students. They have already joined the military. Therefore, they are granted the treatment of appointed military officers. It can be said that Tani Zhenren's individual life has already been dedicated to the country here.</p>
<p>(7)</p>
<p>The class grades at the Naval Academy are the opposite of those in general. The highest grade, the fourth year, is Student Number One, and the lowest grade, the first year, is Student Number Four. It would be completely wrong to think that having a higher number means you can look down on everyone. Student Number Four is the object of scolding, from the instructors to all the upperclassmen. However, there is no one who is the object of the scolding. In the Naval Academy, they don't use the term scolding much. They call it "training." In this view, the object of Student Number Four's training is only himself.</p>
<p>In short, Tani Zhenren is experiencing the Number Four era of the 67th class of the Naval Academy. The class number not only cannot change with the student number, it cannot be changed for life. The friendship of this class of students is closer than society can imagine, and continues forever. After becoming an officer, if one of the classmates dies, ordinary class reunions would only send wreaths with names on them, which is simply to express the depth of friendship. However, the Naval Academy's class reunion not only takes care of all the funeral arrangements, but also plans for everything for the bereaved family in the future. Whether it's a marriage or an unexpected deficit, they consult with their classmates first. This kind of friendship that surpasses blood ties cannot be compared to the gentleman's friendship that is as light as water. The origin of this kinship relationship is said to also come from the shared hardships during the "training" in the Student Number Four era.</p>
<p>Like that narrow door, the new Student Number Four who managed to squeeze in was naturally triumphant when he entered the school, but after a day, he became silent. Because this is another world. Although he had heard before that this was a pure and strictly disciplined world, when he entered, it was like stepping into another world where he couldn't tell east from west. From morning to night, none of his previous life was useful. Attitude, language, walking, eating, sleeping, everything was different from before. It was as if there was an insurmountable chasm separating the world from this other world. During the first bath, the words "wash away the dust of the mundane world" seemed to become vaguely clear. Moreover, the upperclassmen, who lived a life completely opposite to the "mundane world," were like supermen, and he couldn't help but admire them.</p>
<p>One evening, there was a self-introduction in the squad study room. This was also a ritual to remove vulgar customs.</p>
<p>"My name is Tani Zhenren, from the Second Middle School in Kagoshima Prefecture."</p>
<p>Zhenren tried to speak standard language carefully, but the squad warrant officer did not allow it:</p>
<p>"What do you mean by 'ore'? Naval Academy students don't use that kind of language. Say 'I'. Got it?"</p>
<p>The squad warrant officer is the most senior student - the best student in Student Number One is the squad warrant officer. Moreover, the squad includes students from Student Number Four to Student Number One, which has a special meaning. It is similar to the organization of the Ken'er-sha in Kagoshima, so Zhenren understood this meaning earlier than others.</p>

<h3>On the Problem of Secondary Education</h3>
<p>— A Gentleman</p>
<p>The meaning of the word "education" today is not only about imparting knowledge, but more about cultivating students so that they become useful people for society and the country in the future. If we affirm the latter as appropriate, then school education, especially secondary education, should aim to adapt to reality, that is, to meet the needs of the country and society in the future. The people that the country and society will need in the future should have the following as a premise:</p>
<p>Strong physique and agile mind. With a strong physique and agile mind, those who are superior can shoulder heavy responsibilities and achieve great things, while those who are inferior can also work diligently, support themselves, and not be parasites of society. Moreover, noble virtues and rich knowledge all arise from a strong physique and agile mind. Criminal behavior is often a sign of illness. A strong physique can cultivate patience and courage, and know what to pursue and avoid; an agile mind can cultivate careful thinking and clear judgment, so that right and wrong can be distinguished. Therefore, today's education takes these two as a starting point. On the one hand, to provide ample opportunities for physical exercise, and on the other hand, to provide ample opportunities for brain exercise.</p>
<p>Understanding of the individual's relationship to society and their inherent duties. Today, the life of an individual cannot be isolated from society. Therefore, the society and the public that one faces every day should be taken as the norms for the transformation of individual life and be accurately recognized. In particular, they should be trained to fulfill their obligations to society and the public, and the discipline of the public must be known and followed. In this way, society can progress day by day, and the selfish concept of individuals from the past can be eradicated and purified.</p>
<p>Universal common sense is essential for adapting to the times and the current environment. Everyone should have a minimum level of common sense, which is the dissemination of knowledge. However, the goal of this kind of knowledge dissemination is to adapt to the times and the environment, so it is necessary to be flexible and adaptable. At the same time, it is necessary to ensure that students can truly absorb and apply their knowledge. The rigid education and rote learning of the past, where people learn but do not know how to apply their knowledge, must be eliminated as much as possible. Moreover, middle school students are still young, and their physical strength is not sufficient. The curriculum should only be practical and not too heavy. It is necessary to consider whether they can digest it and whether they understand it thoroughly. It is better to have less but be refined than to have more but be superficial.</p>
<p>These three are the essentials of secondary education today, and it is our responsibility to guide young students. There is no difference in intention for girls and boys, because even those who serve the family in the future are still part of society and the country, and have the same needs.</p>

<h3>Park Admission Prices Increase</h3>
<p>The increase in park admission prices on the 25th of this month has greatly surprised the general public. Parks were established with the health of citizens in mind, but selling tickets at high prices daily prevents ordinary people from visiting the park, leading to illness and affecting the health of citizens. If the authorities can truly seek happiness for the citizens, they should slightly reduce the price of admission tickets (Li Yingqing).</p>
<h3>News from Free Schools</h3>
<p>The headquarters of the Guanqun Amateur Tutoring School is located at Room 333, 3rd Floor, Cishu Building, Nanjing Road, and the branch school is located at No. 1014 Xinzha Road (West End of Matthews Road). In the past, the founder, Mr. Xu Guanqun, donated many free places. This semester, it is heard that the morning classes at the headquarters will still charge half fees across all grades. In addition, the evening classes have a total of 50 fully exempted, 100 half-exempted, and 200 quarter-exempted scholarships. The branch school has unlimited enrollment. Those who are truly from poor families and have aspirations can apply. The headquarters school starts on February 7, and the branch school starts on February 10.</p>
<p>The Qiming Free Night School is hosted by graduates of the Sino-French School in 1939 and has been open for one year. In addition to not charging tuition and miscellaneous fees, it also provides books for free. It is now scheduled to recruit transfer students for grades 3, 4, 5, and 6 from January 30 to February 4. Those from poor families who cannot afford to continue their studies can bring their ID card and parental seal to the school (No. 286 Lane, La Yaode Road, 8th District, inside the China Girls' Middle School) from 3:00 PM to 6:00 PM every day within the above-mentioned time limit to obtain an application form and take the exam.</p>
