<h3>「必勝國民讀」譯本序</h3>
<p>— 陳彬龢</p>
<p>盟邦日本輿論蜀前輩德富蘇峯翁，近著「必勝國民讀本」一書，分為三篇：　必勝的必須，　必勝的基礎；　必勝的方策。</p>
<p>綜觀德富翁本書的主旨，在於喚起日本國民堅定必勝信念，爭取最後勝利。在此大東亞戰爭面臨決戰階段，生死存亡的嚴重關頭，本書的出版，不但是切合時宜，而且人人有一謮之必要。</p>
<p>本書的讀者對象，雖則是日本國民。然而，我們中國當前的國家處境，我們國民應該知道堅定必勝信念，實與日本國民同樣需要。換言之，我們今日是參戰國家的一員，勝則存，敗則邙，與盟邦同其命運，欲求國家生存，同樣有其非勝不可的原因。誠然，必勝是必須的，可是，必勝的取得，決非顢頇因循所能達成的。這裏，德富翁提出了必勝的方策，也就是走向勝利的途徑。這些方策，更足以提供我們朝野的參考和效法。所以，我們即將本書譯成中文出版，我們唯一目的，就是喚起朝野大家堅定必勝信念。也唯有大東亞參戰國家的國民，共同堅定必勝信念，實行必勝方策，才能達到必勝目的。</p>
<p>我們常說：「堅定信念為凡事成功之母」。古諺也說：「有志者，事竟成。」「有志」就是「堅定信念」，如果本身的信念，尙游移動搖，不能堅定，則不待對方的打擊，不待環境的壓迫，已先自亂陣脚，弱點畢露，失敗將接踵而至了。所以，我們在此嚴重關頭，堅定必勝信念，更不能不三致意之。</p>
<p>本書第三篇第一節中說：「必勝的取得，首先在於確信必勝。無必勝信念，而取得必勝者，恐怕世界上就沒有這樣事。……必勝信念，是無論對抗什麼大敵，無論碰到什麼困難，無論遭受什麼打擊，也都拚命爭取勝利，毫不認輪，就是這種信念。」這裏巳經更明顯的說明了怎樣才是必勝信念。然而具備了必勝信念，仍須堅定不移，始終不渝。</p>
<p>本節又說：「第一次世界大戰時，法國受到絕端壓迫，幾乎與德國締結城下之盟，法國土氣沮喪，軍隊暴動頻興，但由於必勝信念，而旗色鮮明，名正言順，精神渙發，終於博得勝利，這種勝利，完全由於克雷孟梭和福煦二人的必勝信念所取得，也絕非過言。這就是說，內閣總理一個人的信念，就是全甌民的信念。總司令一個人的信念，就是全軍的信念。這在全國人民的必勝信念上說，就是主要的。所以我們能够擊淸英美的第一個條件，就是我們日本人的必須擊潰敵人之信念。」</p>
<p>「內閣總理一個人的信念，就是全國國民的信念。總司令一個人的信念，就是全軍的信念。」這種觀察，我們認為原則上是正確的。去年四月廿二日申報社評會以「肅淸和平區內的失敗主養者」為題，說：「目前在和平區域以內，一般人尤其是黨政人員中問對於和平信念，還嫌缺少堅定性，就少數從政者的行為來說，直到今天，還不了解和平眞諦，更說不上若何信念。認為目前不過是過渡時代的現象，暫時的局面，於是利用機會作混水撈魚的勾當。這華人，雖不是領導入物，却都估據各機關要津，憑藉職位為掩護，以行利令智昏之舉。發表談話，一片爲民為國，而實際行爲，盡得其反。於是，大多數人民的覜感，就發生了反響的作用。所以，國府為取得廣大人民堅定的和平信念，對於此輩失敗主義者或動搖份子有肅淸或制裁的必要。」就我們中國的環境言，少數領導者縱然有了必勝信念，而黨政人員中大多數人還是並無信念或是信念不够堅定，那來，並不能如德富翁所說的「內閣總理一個人的信念，就是全國民的信念。」我們應該說：「黨政領導者以及黨政工作人員都堅定了必勝信念，才能影響全國國民堅定必勝信念。」例如黨政工作人員都能努力從公，使政治上軌道，統制經濟上執道，民生得能初步安定黨政人員如能這樣的努力從公，綫是必勝的方策。在道樣實施必勝方策之下，全國國民自然會共問堅定信念，達到必勝的目的。</p>
<p>其次，最近因為歐洲時局的演變，一般人受請言的波動，不免信念動搖。其實，愈是在嚴重關頭，愈是在動盪之中，愈是要把握必勝信念，堅定不移。古諺云：「疾風知勁草，板蕩識忠臣。」在這信念能否堅定的分野中，我們將德富翁本書譯文出版，更是切合時宜的。</p>
<h3>日首相施政演說　闡明決戰諸方策　對東印民族將承認其獨立</h3>
<p>東京七日中央社電　日本第八十五次臨時議會之開會典禮，七日於日天皇陛下之親臨下，在賣放皖議塲隆震舉行。日本天島陸下，於藤田侍從武官等之泰侍中，上午十一時幸臨貴族院，諸官員致最敬禮後，小磯首相捧呈動語書，陛下當即頒賜優渥　語，佐佐木副議長敬致拜受勒語　後退下，軍此開會典禮遂吿完畢，十一時十五分，陛下於諸官員之恭送中，還駕宮中，日天皇陛下所賜動語如次：「朕於此帝國議會時特吿貴放院及衆議院各員，朕外征之師，勇戰奮門，隨處破勁敵，宣揭威武，大東亞之建設骎骎而進，與友邦之締盟亦愈堅固，斯固朕所常歡懌者，然敵之反抗益趨激烈，戰局日危，皇國舉其總力而決勝之機巳臨，今日鄉等宜先衆憤激鞏固乏圑結，奮而破碎敵國之野念，以抉翼國運於無窮，朕已命國務大臣向帝國議會提出期係時局之緊急議案，卿等應善體朕意，和衷共議，以竭協贊之任」。</p>
<h3>兩院全體會議</h3>
<p>東京瓶日中央社電　日第八十五次臨時議會，七日舉行開院典禮，奉戴優渥勅語，日貴衆兩院際此決勝良機，毅然奮起，是日衆院先於上午十一時三十分舉行全體會議，決定奉答動語起草委員，下午舉行全體會議，一方貴族院亦於下午一時半，召開全體會議，議決動語奉答書後，推舉德川國順公爵為臨時議長，決定全院委員長及各常任委員，繼之小磯首相於全　緊張嚴肅空氣中登台演講，關明一般施政方針，披瀝皇國必勝之信念，本諸最高戰爭指導方針，結集決戰國家總力之重大決意，同時代本此意旨，具體聞明小磯內閣之抱懷及應付決戰之內外諸方策。首相演說施政方針後，繼由彬山睦相，米內海相報告戰况，於報告演說中，堅決表示擊滅敵人之日，巳為期不遠，如是賣族皖即提呈感謝敬弔將士決議案，全場一致贊同。是時有大河內正寵子起立，就增强軍需生產及空襲對策，對首相提出質問，即由小磯首相及關係各大臣辯答後，始行散會。休息中之衆議院，俟貴族院散會後，復三次舉行全體會議，仍與貴族院同樣由小磯首相演說施政方針，陸海兩相報告戰况，同時並提出感謝敬弔皇軍將兵決議案，全場一致通過，至是臨時議會第一日議程乃吿終了。</p>
<p>東京七日中央社電　小磯首相七日於第八十五次議會席間，發表施政演說，大意如次：目今日本已達興廢之重大時局，願祖先神靈庇護下，維護世界無匹之日本皇國國體，發揚光糧悠久之歷史，亦在於今日。本人與一兆同胞，共同把握堅確之必勝信念，大和一致，集結總力，與立於第一綫之日軍壯士，謀相策應，運營國務，以期吻合戰爭目齣之完遂。大東亞戰爭之目的，適如宜戰詔書所示，乃為日本之自存自衛，不得已之倔起，同時有復興大東亞之大目標，洵不僅賭大和民族生死之戰，且亦決定亞洲十億人民運命之大決戰也，今戰局已危急，故皇國之興廢，實繫於今日，為打開此危局，當應使國政之運營與大東亞戰爭目的完全劃一，以謀文武相應，統帥國務密切吻合，而期强力之戰爭指導萬無遺憾，此所以有最高戰爭指導會議之設置，今後以此會議運營關政，綜合統帥與國務，而決定根本方針，故萬般施策，均基於此。</p>
<h3>六項施策</h3>
<p>當前戰局之第一施策，在昂楊戰意與確立國家必勝體勢，昂楊戰意自以澈底振作國體觀念為本，突破萬難，維護萬邦無比之國體，此堅强決心，即必勝信念之源泉，羣固之國體念即最偉大之戰力與全國一切扶翼天壤無窮之國運，乃一億同胞數千年來之悠久信仰，此種偉大精神所至，乃以稟冽萬古之國民氣魄，外以粉碎敵人夢想之謀略，內以滅私奉公之精神，完成國內磐石之體勢。重要施策之二，即增强戰力，凡能加强戰力者，當傾國力以赴，就中主要者，即航空戰力之從速增强，賴此把握戰局之主勤性，使緊迫之決戰有利展開，至對常前決戰不能發揮有效戰力之各他設施及產業活動，應立于停止，以轉向重點產業，此種措置己逐步實施。第三項重要施策，為增產食糧及安定國民生活，在戰爭中，維持民生之最低限度，賣乃急務，一億同胞，在相當之窮困生活中，忍耐沉着，迄今續向勝利之途邁進者，實乃國民性健全優秀之所致，洵値感激。</p>
<h3>國民動員</h3>
<p>重要施策之第四項，為勞務及國民動員事項，値此重大時局，全國之內，不問老幼男女，實不容一人遊閒，一億國民，各就職場，傾其精力，完成其各人之使命，以盡人事，而俟神助也。政府對於徵用制度及勞力之分配管理等，常詳加檢討，以謀其均衡改善，同時更計劃所有方策藉求澈底發動國民之勞力。重要施策之第五項，為增强國土之防衛，前此敵機數次來襲本士西部之際，官民咸能果敢防衛，使損害上於最少限度者，實可自豪，將來無論敵機如何來襲，官民仍應以熾烈之鬥志，從事國土防衛。重耍施策之第六項，為決用科學技術動員事項，現代之戰爭，幾全為科學戰，政府力求陸海軍科學技術能得統一運用，並謀日本科學技術即時戰力化，迅速生產多量之決戰兵器，除設置特殊機構外，並獎勵民間對於新兵器等之發明，如此日本同胞之所有技術，皆可一至用於戰爭，其效果尙堪期待。</p>
<h3>戰時外交</h3>
<p>最後與國內施策相呼應之皇國戰時外交，與盟友德國益加緊密携提，對於大東亞之友邦，更期協力一致，舉總力遂行戰爭，同時對於中立各國保特友好關係，盟邦德國在形勢變遷極度困難之中，尤能自信最後勝利，繼續勇戰，賣堪欽佩，蓋能在難局中發揮底力，相信不久戰勢入有利地位，吾等遙祈其最後成功，大東亞各國家各國民，在現時局中，猶不微動，更能在此時局演進中，誓誠復興東亞，與皇國結成一體，增强戰爭體制，此乃足以自恃者也。泰國前此曾改組內閣，然阿巴溫總理大臣閣下之新內閣，亦根據盟約，堅持共同遂行戰爭之方針，此乃大東亞鞏固團結之左證。緬甸國獨立，業已一週年，在巴　國家代　閣下熱誠指導下，克服全國幾多困難，其發展及完遂戰爭之決意，皆甚旺盛。菲律實國之獨立，亦近一年，由於洛勒爾大總統之指導有效，戰時下之食糧治安，咸得其道，刻正積極整務戰力體制，實乃一有力之友邦。</p>
<h3>東亞團結</h3>
<p>自由印度臨時政府主席江特拉鮑斯閣下等，為印度獨立而犧牲奮鬥，其熱意實堪欽佩，皇國當局今後仍予以有力之援助，以期達其獨立目齣。對於東印方面，帝國於去年曾根據原住民之夙願，尤其參與政事，最折各地住民業已了解帝國之眞意，爲完遂大東亞戰爭。始終一貫，繼續努力，其對於現在軍政之協力，異常顯薯，因此帝國為確保東印民族永達之福社，茲聲明將來承認其獨立，帝國政府對於大東亞各地之政策，將來依舊堅持，故今後行將益加發揮大東亞共同宜言之精神，以應大東亞各國家各民族之信賴，如是以皇國為中核之大東亞，在堅決之必勝信念下，鞏固國結，集結一切總力，向大東亞復興之聖戰邁進，確信萬古不滅之皇國世界理想，行將顯揚於悠久之後世也。</p>
<h3>陸相報吿戰况</h3>
<p>東京七日中央社電　日杉山陸相，七日於臨時議會中，報告戰况要旨如次：</p>
<p>中南部太平洋方面，新布列顚島與波根維爾島日守軍，皆予敵以痛擊，於波根維爾附近及其他各要地，仍在我軍手中，惟塞班島方面日軍，雖奮勇作戰，卒為美軍佔領，實深遺憾。大宮烏及迭尼安島日陸海軍部隊，現正一致圑結，於困難之環境下，勇敢作戰，於此慘烈之戰况下，士氣猶極為旺感。於塞班，大宮，迭尼安島，予敵之損害，據美軍發表，已達三萬餘衆。新幾內亞方面，日軍自入七月以來，曾猛攻阿伊塔伯附近敵軍，使受重創，現美軍於有力之機動艦隊掩護下，次第侵入荷蘭地亞，薩爾密之必阿克方面，日陸軍部隊與陸海軍航空隊，現正相互協力奮戰中，於薩爾密附近，曾一度將敵擊還，於必阿兄海岸，則以寡兵子敵以重創，敵軍現仍逐次增加兵力。反之，日軍則正克服所有困難，勇敢對敵反復攻繫中。</p>
<p>緬甸方面，於本年二月，會將目馬猶山侵入之渝軍殲滅，其後，更先發制人，進攻伊姆法爾，哥希馬各部隊，於四月攻陷哥布馬及比先波爾各要地，其後於哥希馬與伊姆法爾方面，與渝軍展開激戰，渝軍死傷約三萬，鹵獲及破壞其大砲達百門，同時於戰略方面亦予敵以重大打擊，於獲得如此龐大戰果後，刻該方面芷在恢復原防中。又敵軍於加薩附近曾降落空軍之當貢河谷方面，以美式裝備之渝軍五師及怒江正面之其他渝軍十五師，曾逐向日軍陳地侵入。怒江正面日軍以寡兵舊戰，並以要地為據點，反復逆襲，結果已震創侵入加薩之空輪部隊，日軍更屢次反復攻擊自富貢正面侵入之渝軍，予以重大損害，現日軍正於密芝那南方及東西要綫準術次期作戰。去年底以來，子渝軍之損害，據最折渝方發表，本年以來，戰死負傷約八萬，戰病者達三十餘萬。</p>
<p>中國大陸方面</p>
<p>京濱綫作戰，自四月下旬開始，於五月二十五日攻陷洛陽，繼之於五月下旬農開粵漠沿綫作戰，八月八日攻陷衡陽，該次作戰，因巳使渝美空軍妨碍日軍海上交通與空襲日本本土之企國完全成為警餅，故意襲極為震大。該作戰至本日止，日軍犧牲者為七千三百五十名，渝軍損大則更為　天，計陣亡及被俘虜者約十七萬五千，並　獲大砲七百五十門，機槍三千挺，步槍三萬七千挺。又最近本土及滿洲方面敵空軍巳前後來襲北九州及南滿洲五次，經日軍制空部除勇敢迎戰，結果已將其自負之B29型長距離轟炸機擊落達三十餘架之多，日機更有以自己愛繼衝撞敵機者，其攻擊精神之旺盛，實巳發揮無餘。</p>
<p>航空作戰方面按去年底左右，大東亞各戰綫美空軍之第一綫兵力約有五千架，所羅門羣鳥，俾斯麥羣鳥及新幾內亞東部方面，約有一千五巨架，該方面日陸海軍機隊互相協力，於去年底以來常與數倍之敵機交戰，其間僅陸軍方面所獲之戰果，已擊落及擊毀敵機有一千餘架，然日方因兵力量及補給能力與基地能力等關係，致於戰力發揮上有難以避免之處。緬甸正面之敵機約八百架至一千架，日陸軍機隊雖受兵力關係及其他困難之限制，仍勇敢對抗數倍之敵，自去年底以來敵機被擊落者有五百三十架，被擊毀者約二百架。中國方面，渝軍自今春以來，即急速增强基地兵力，迄最近止，渝機總數已達七百餘架之多，其中B29型機預料至少有一百數十架，日空軍機隊時常以巧妙戰術與敵機戰鬥，自去年底以來，共擊落其五百架，擊毀其一千架。</p>
<p>千島方面</p>
<p>日機與海軍互相協力，刻正對在該方面之敵機四巨架實行邀戰中，以上乃日陸軍機隊之戰鬥戰况，自去年底以來，陸軍空陸兩部隊，其擊落數機二千七百架，而日機亦損失六百零四架，總之，敵軍於太平洋及大陸方固之反攻極為激烈，今日實為粉碎敵軍野望之良繼，日陸軍決國結一致，衝攻所有難關，以完成守護國土之大任。今敵方人員損失激增，且有戰綫擴大次補給綫延長等不利條件，反之，日方由於戰綫　小。補給綫之减少及作戰基地之强化等，全為戰略上之有利條件，茲陸海軍緊密協力，集結所有戰力與敵周旋，同時，我全國國民亦熟烈努力，共同從事飛機之增產，故深信目前實為打倒敵人，完成戰爭之天賜良機也。</p>
<h3>東日軍　突入海口巿</h3>
<p>廣州七日中央社電　據實慶電，日本浙東方面精銳，自八月二十七日攻佔　水後，續沿甌江急追渝軍，四日突入麗水東南二十公里乏海口市，目下激戰中。</p>
<p>日機猛炸贛州機塲</p>
<p>中國前綫基地七日中央社電　日轟炸機隊會於六日黎明，進攻渝　一綫基地贛州機場，轟炸其掩護地區及滑走路附近，睦上似蒙相常損失。惟因視綫不佳，未能確認戰果，日機全部安返基地。</p>
<h3>三項預算追加案　日閣提交衆議院　將於今日下午開始審議</h3>
<p>東京七日中央社電　日內閣於七日將左列各預算案提交衆議院。　昭和十九年度（民國三十三年度）歲入歲出總預算追加案。　昭和十九年度特別會計歲入歲出預算追加案。　臨時軍費預算追加案及另外一件。</p>
<p>東京七日中央社電　日本衆議院六日上午十時半舉行預算委員候補者之全體懇談會，協議預算委員會之運營方針，質問審議之目標等，結果通過　鑒於決戰議會之本義，當選定重點，以資集中議論。　質問者及質問步序，質問項目，由委員長及理事光行做成草案，再提交全體討論。　預算審議自八日下午開始。其審議項目之重點。甲·確立必勝國內體制，乙·增產軍需生產特別注意航空兵器之增產，丙·食糧問題。又於確立必勝國內體制內，關於戰事指導，國民運動，肅正綱祀，輿論指導，昂揚國民士第等，自精神方面集中率直反映民意之議論，努力發揮議會機能之意見。此項預算總會對臨時軍事費之審議以及質問等，頗有期待。</p>
<p>積極推進農業增產</p>
<p>東京七日中央社電　日本此次臨時議會中所提出之十九年度一般會計追加預算案，其中除臨時歲會經費六萬二千元外；共餘之七億八千五百餘元，全爲食糧增產之經費。按此計劃預料可增收大米一百七十萬石，麥一百十萬石。又爲確保農業工作八員，將聽取小磯首相之提議，該案係以農業後繼者為中心，組織甲種食糧增產隊、並將隊員由三萬人增至六萬人，以隨時隨地出動之。此外並將市町材中年在十七八歲，不能編入甲種增產隊之靑年約五十萬名，組成乙種增產隊，使於農繁期中之二閱月問，從事食糧增產工作。又農業學校學生八萬名，於週年動員之原則下，以農地爲敎室，當可學得實際之農業按術，此次增產運動之中心目的，乃係出農兵隊完成確保增產之工作。此外，並設立將午馬無代價貸與各畜農家制度及各代價配給　鷄制度，同時平均每一府縣選出二百十名之女子農業按術員，以謀加强增產對策</p>
<h3>奪取長塘街後　日軍佔領祁陽　湘江南岸白水陷落</h3>
<p>湖南前綫七日中央社電　日軍快速部隊三日奪取長塘街後，即急追第四十六軍，五日晨將湘桂鐵路之要衝祁賜佔領，按該地爲渝美空軍之前進基地，距零陸僅卅公里。</p>
<p>湖南前綫七日中央社電　湖南日軍精銳爲呼應祁陽之佔領，在金蘭寺附近亦開始行動，擊潰渝軍第五十八師，沿湘桂鐵路向西南推進五十數公里。五日晨抵達祁陽西北二十公里之文明衛，他方日軍西進部隊，四日越過白水市，於同時傍晚，奪取祁陽爾方三公里之長流街，遮斷渝軍退路，以祁陽為中心之戰局，益形急迫。</p>
<p>湖南前綫七日中央社電　湖南日軍先鋒佔領常寗後，續向巴城山岳地帶前進，四日晨佔領常寗西方四十公里之白水市，該地渝軍卅一軍十四師主力，均被擊退。按白水市位於常寗零陸中間，為湘江南岸之交通要衝，目下渝軍東南方面軍事之動脈，已完全被遮斷。</p>
<h3>海相報告戰况</h3>
<p>東京七日中央社電　日海相米內大將，於八十五屆議會報告戰况之大要如次：茲簡述前次議會以後之一般戰局，並披瀝所信之一端如下：</p>
<p>中部太平洋</p>
<p>方面，二月上旬，馬紹爾之一角委諸敵手以來，敵軍有力之機動部隊，又繼績來襲馬利亞納，加羅林羣島及南鳥烏等，以削弱日軍前進基地。迨至六月中旬，敵又於空母戰艦十數艘為基幹乏大機動部隊掩護下，佔領塞班，其後復於迭尼女，大宮烏登陸，但日軍今仍在舊職中。新幾內亞方面之敵軍，亦與中部太平洋之作戰相呼應，於五月下旬侵攻必阿克島，八月上旬又進至新幾內亞西北部之桑沙波爾，日陸海軍在此等戰門中，勇戰舊門，予敵以重創，然日軍之犧牲亦不少。</p>
<p>日聯合艦隊</p>
<p>海上部隊，與馬利亞納方而日軍呼應，亦曾活躍，然因航空兵力未能如意供給，致未能掃蕩敵登陸部隊，誠屬遺憾。敵軍由於前述之作戰，於馬利亞納方面及新幾內亞西北部地域獲得有力之航空基地羣，遂次擴大其航空威力圈，致　小笠原島，硫確島方面，菲律賓方而，加羅林羣島方面之空襲漸趨熾烈。北太平洋方面之敵繼空襲亦　頻繁，時向北千島要地加以砲擊，實須嚴加警戒。而由印度洋方面向蘇門答臘，中爪哇方面之戰機，亦熾烈展開活動之勢，在此期中，敵潛水艇之跳　極為活躍，海軍在陸軍及其他部隊協力下，拼命防攻，而獲得確實</p>
<p>擊沉敵潛艇</p>
<p>百三十　，擊毀四十二艘之大戰　，然今後尤須努力，以期獲舉空前之戰績，而日軍潛水艇部隊，亦在廣泛之海洋行使各種重要任務，日前曾堅况敵航空母艦二艘，戰艦一艘，巡洋艦一艘，擊毀艦艇約為此數之二倍，此外尙獲有擊沉敵船舶約二十四艘十八萬噸之戰果，率直言之，今春以來之戰局，我軍於各方面雖皆有局部之顯著戰果，然就大局觀之，現狀仍在猝須覺悟，今後之戰局尙多困難，然由於第一綫將兵之勇敢善戰，為依恃物量之頑敵所憂，有形無形損害旣重且大，敵軍愈深入。</p>
<p>日本國防圈</p>
<p>內　其　多之困難與弱點亦遂衛畢露。竊思以寡敵衆，乃古來日本兵法之妙義，帝國海軍年來之苦心，亦在於此，此視彼我物心兩面少長短，看破敵軍隱蔽之困難與弱點時，確信帝國之海軍今後更將發動必勝之方策也。今茲尤有言者，乃衆人皆知之作戰要件，亦即今日之戰局中獲得陸上海上制空權，乃作戰之必須條件，若無此等制空權，飛機自不待言，無　任何精强之戰艦及優乃之機械化部隊，亦不堪期待。由連日之戰况中，即可洞悉其所以要求急速充實新銳飛機者，實即在於此，現在</p>
<p>海軍航空隊，不分晝夜與敵交戰，近隨戰局逐日熾烈，飛機之消耗已漸增多，又機件發生障碍者，亦超出豫料之外，金　望一億國民諸君相互協力，向第一綫部隊輸送其所期望之飛機，藉求得以充分活躍。余在皇威之下，願與國民諸君共誓，決以熱試急速充實所有之戰備，以此與第一綫部隊打成一片，掣取敵遠征軍之弱點，予以澈底之痛擊，同時更望國內亦應以戰勝為最終目的，發揮堅志持久堅固不拔之精神，各就職守，作</p>
<p>必勝之努力日本聯合艦隊在麼田司令長官統率之下，士氣倍極旺盛，且均燃起滅敵之信念，此余所最感欣慰者也。</p>

<p>南京七日中央社電　日小　首相於此次日臨時議會施政演說中，聲明將來承認東印之獨立，此實爲盟邦援助東亞被壓迫民族完成獨立解放之又一具體證明。我國府陳代主席爲此特談表談話，對日小磯首相之車大聲明，除表欽偑外，更勗全國同胞，體認國家民族之前途，及其對大東亞宣霄之責任二愈益奮發，以求戰爭之完遂。茲錄如下：盟邦小硎首相閣下，日昨於八十五屆臨時議會發表施政方針，爲使去年以來盟邦政府，依於東印原住民之夙願，而允許參與政事之努力，有更進个步之發展，鄭重聲明，將來承認東亞之獨立，此為盟邦援助東，不惜舉其國力，担任保衛東亞之前鋒。去年十个月召集大東亞會議，發表大東亞共同宣言，更共同確立東亞民族互助互惠，共存共衛之基本原則。此次聲明，亦即一本其發動大東亞戰爭之初哀使大東亞宜言一字一句，付之實現。在此決戰階段，其所給予東亞各民族明朗而有力之影響，及其所給予英美侵略主義者致命之打擎，實至重大，固不僅在爭取解放途中之東印人民，為之雀躍已也。</p>
<p>吾人於此，益當深切認識，此次戰爭爲整個東亞存亡之所繫，亦爲東亞圈內任何國家民族獨立與奴隸之分界。唯以東亞民族之共同奮門，乃能根絕侵略主義之禍毒，而確保東亞之全體解放。唯能確保東亞之全體解放，乃能確保各國家民族之獨立生存，與安定發達，進而由東亞之安定與和平，貢獻於世界之安定與和平，此非空言所能致。能　力而後能有收獲，能犧牲而後取得代價，是又吾人對於小磯首相此次有力之聲明，致其感佩之餘，深願我全體國民體認國家民族之前途，及其對大東亞共同　言之責任，愈益奮發。並深冀我東亞民族愈益團結，以求戰爭之完遂者也</p>
<p>周代院長　南京七日中央社電　大意為日首相小　聲明將來允準東印獨立，此實爲貫澈大東亞戰爭神聖目的之劃時代的措置，至為欽佩。蓋大東亞戰爭之目的，在解放為英美國家及民族，如英美勢力驅逐離開東亞之後，東亞各國家與民族仍不龍得到獨立自由，殊違背大東亞戰爭之神聖目的。小　首相之聲明，與大東亞戰爭精神，正相符合，吾人除表示贊佩外，深盼東亞各國家，各民族，協助此聲明之具證實現，並進而更加努力協助盟邦日本完成大東亞戰爭之勝利，以　定東亞各國家各族共榮之　　。</p>
<p>林宣部長　南京七日中央社電　林宜傅部長於聆悉小磯有相，於臨時議會發表將來承認東印度獨立之聲明後，舉出兩點，大意爲　日本此舉乃是道義精神的援助。　我國應認識明邦之誠意，爭取民族的獨立，共求東亞解放。</p>
<h3>火車班次減少　內河航運暢通　水上運輸力日見激增</h3>
<p>自從華中鐵道各綫車輛班次，減少以還，交通運輸，仰仗於航輪者較前更甚，中央社記者爲明瞭本市對外水上交通之情形，特走訪上海內河輪船公可，據該公司負責人稱：滬上商運，過去雖賴陸上運輸，然因上貨落貨地點關係，水脚運費高昂，實際沿京滬杭蕩各地貨物運滬，全由內河輸船運輸，因其上貨下貨地點，船隻多在碼頭，運入倉庫，較爲便利，且運費低廉，故該公司雖對燃營問題與鐵路同樣感覺困難，但爲發揚水上運輪使命起見，仍全力維持過去航綫，故自火車班次減少之後，水上運輸力，不但未減，但日形激增，尤以近一月內，往返於京滬杭嘉各地旅客，多因購買火車票不易，故紛紛改搭內河輪船。最返統討，搭輸船往以上各地之旅客，共達三十一萬五千餘人之多，足見水上交通便利，無足影響行旅。目前該公司更爲積極推進內河交通起見，特將原有班次，力加調整，雖感燃料缺乏，但仍不使原有杭綫中斷。</p>

<h3>關於物價對策　正縝密研究中　周代院長解答要點</h3>
<p>南京七日中央社電　行政院代院長兼財政部長周佛海氏於七日上午十一時，在中儲會議室接見首都中外記者，就記者所關各點，詳爲解答，茲誌如下：（一）關於金價問題，近日呈反常現象，狂漲不已，影響物價至鉅，揆諸原因，則爲　有人囤積操縱，滬市當局對此曾一度嚴勵檢舉懲處，　由於人民心理關係，賀風趨盛，當局對此已籌劃對策中。</p>
<p>（二）關於物們問題，可從通貨與物資兩方面言，現時物價上漲，絕非通貨膨脹，蓋因中儲劵流通區域日廣，鈔劵發行額自應增加，自</p>
<p>不能謂為通貨膨脹　覩滬市及各地金融狀况利息之高調即可爲籌碼不敖支　配之佐證，故物價趨漲，受物資缺乏及一般人囤積之原因最大，今後如何能使物價安定，當努力於增加生產，與節約消費。然增加生產簡題，極爲複雜，如燃料原料現運輪等問題，必須一一設法解決。關於物價對策及整個具體計劃，刻當局正縝密研究中。（三）關於中儲券與</p>
<p>日圓比率決不變更蓋一國更，必影響經濟混亂及物價暴漲，然影響所及，不僅爲我國，即日本亦受相當影響。此次在日，余曾與小磯總理及石渡重光兩大臣晤談，對此事意見相同，愈堅定不變更原兌換比率之決心。（四關於各地銀錢業之設立，京滬一帶早已戰止新設，而銀行錢店較少之地，亦視</p>
<p>各地情形加以限制（五）關於貨次日銀行對中儲之四億日與借欵，係作爲中儲之發展準備，今後中儲準備金當益充足，信用日增，自不待言。（六）關於通貨之收回，財政部與中儲行巳盡極大之努力，以普通國家言，通貨之收回方策，當爲　發行公債，　獎勵儲蓄。關於第一點，因國府財政甚爲充足，故無發行公債之必要，現僅發行有建設公債，至發行數字，亦不甚多，到於獎麗備畜方圍，當局業巳舉辦，且具租當成統。刻下關於通貨之收回，當局巳實施第三步驟，即以</p>
<p>物資買出收回通貨本人此與石渡大藏大臣磋商，由日方協力運供大量物資，以作收回通貨之用。（七）關於稅收方面，爲減輕人民負担，對稅收方面而實施實物徵稅，如蘇皖兩省已開徽田賦稅，今後不正當之稅收，即加取消。最後周氏談及此次訪日有一深刻感想稱：「余會一度往訪</p>
<p>總理大臣東條大將大將私乘汽車前往須五十分鐘，乘電車需二小時許，大將引退後，已無汽車乘坐，雖軍部方面願借用汽車一輛，但被東條大將拒絕，故對余表示歉意，謂不能答訪。此足證日本政治組織及狀况自好，實可爲我國所仿效者也」云云。</p>

        <h1>1944 - n248</h1>
<h3>Preface to the Translated Version of "The Indispensable Book for a Victorious Nation"</h3>
<p>— Chen Binhe</p>
<p>My ally Japan's elder statesman and prominent figure in public opinion, Mr. Tokutomi Sohō, recently authored "The Indispensable Book for a Victorious Nation," divided into three sections: The Necessity of Victory; The Foundation of Victory; The Strategies for Victory.</p>
<p>Looking at the overall purpose of Mr. Tokutomi's book, it lies in arousing the Japanese people to firmly believe in victory and strive for the final triumph. At this crucial juncture when the Greater East Asia War faces a decisive stage, a matter of life and death, the publication of this book is not only timely but also essential reading for everyone.</p>
<p>Although the intended audience of this book is the Japanese people, our current national situation in China and the need for our citizens to maintain a firm belief in victory are just as important as they are for the Japanese. In other words, we are now a member of the participating nations, and our survival depends on victory, while defeat means destruction. Sharing the same fate as our allies, we have reasons why we absolutely must win for the sake of national survival. Indeed, victory is essential, but it cannot be achieved through complacency and procrastination. Here, Mr. Tokutomi presents the strategies for victory, which are the pathways to achieving it. These strategies can also serve as a reference and model for our government and the public. Therefore, we are translating and publishing this book into Chinese with the sole purpose of arousing a firm belief in victory among all. Only when the citizens of all participating nations in the Greater East Asia War jointly hold a firm belief in victory and implement strategies for victory can we achieve the goal of victory.</p>
<p>We often say, "A firm belief is the mother of all success." An ancient proverb also says, "Where there's a will, there's a way." "Having a will" means "having a firm belief." If one's own belief is still wavering and cannot be firmly established, then before the enemy's attack or the pressure of the environment, one will have already lost one's footing, revealing weaknesses and inviting failure. Therefore, at this critical juncture, we cannot emphasize the importance of a firm belief in victory enough.</p>
<p>In the first section of the third part of this book, it says, "The attainment of victory begins with the conviction of victory. Without a belief in victory, achieving it is probably impossible in the world… A belief in victory is the determination to fight for victory at all costs, without surrendering, no matter what great enemy one faces, what difficulties one encounters, or what blows one suffers. It is this kind of belief." This clearly explains what constitutes a belief in victory. However, possessing a belief in victory still requires unwavering and enduring commitment.</p>
<p>This section also states, "During World War I, France was under extreme pressure and nearly signed a treaty of surrender with Germany. French morale was low, and mutinies frequently occurred in the army. However, due to the belief in victory, the colors were clear, the name was just, and the spirit was revived, ultimately achieving victory. This victory was entirely due to the belief in victory held by Clemenceau and Foch, which is by no means an exaggeration. This means that the belief of a single Prime Minister is the belief of the entire nation. The belief of a single Commander-in-Chief is the belief of the entire army. This is crucial in the belief in victory of the entire nation. Therefore, the first condition for us to defeat the Anglo-Americans is that we Japanese must have the belief in defeating the enemy."</p>
<p>"The belief of a single Prime Minister is the belief of the entire nation. The belief of a single Commander-in-Chief is the belief of the entire army." We believe this observation is correct in principle. Last April 22nd, the editorial board of Shen Bao published an article titled "Purging Defeatists in the Peaceful Areas," stating: "Currently, within the peaceful areas, the general public, especially party and government officials, lack a firm belief in peace. Judging from the behavior of a few politicians, they still do not understand the true meaning of peace, let alone have any belief in it. They see the present situation as a transitional phase, a temporary state, and thus seize opportunities to profit from the chaos. These Chinese, although not leaders, occupy important positions in various institutions, using their positions as cover to act foolishly and blindly for profit. They speak of serving the people and the country, but their actual behavior is the opposite. As a result, the feelings of the majority of the people have a backlash effect. Therefore, in order for the National Government to gain the firm belief of the vast majority of the people in peace, it is necessary to purge or sanction these defeatists or wavering elements." In the context of our Chinese situation, even if a few leaders have a belief in victory, if the majority of party and government officials do not have a belief or their belief is not firm enough, then it cannot be said, as Mr. Tokutomi does, that "the belief of a single Prime Minister is the belief of the entire nation." We should say, "Only when party and government leaders and staff firmly believe in victory can they influence the entire nation to firmly believe in victory." For example, if party and government staff can work diligently and impartially, putting politics on the right track, controlling the economy effectively, and stabilizing people's livelihoods to a certain extent, that is a strategy for victory. With the implementation of such strategies for victory, the entire nation will naturally share a firm belief and achieve the goal of victory.</p>
<p>Furthermore, recently, due to the evolution of the European situation, the fluctuations in public opinion have inevitably shaken beliefs. In fact, the more critical the juncture, the more turbulent the times, the more we must grasp the belief in victory and remain steadfast. An ancient proverb says, "Strong winds reveal sturdy grass, turbulent times reveal loyal ministers." At this juncture where the firmness of belief is being tested, the publication of the translated version of Mr. Tokutomi's book is even more timely.</p>
<h3>Japanese Prime Minister's Policy Speech Explains Various Decisive Strategies, Will Recognize the Independence of the East Indies Peoples</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - The opening ceremony of the 85th Extraordinary Session of the Japanese Diet was held solemnly on the 7th at the Diet building, graced by the presence of His Majesty the Emperor of Japan. At 11:00 AM, amidst the escort of Fujita, Military Aide-de-Camp, His Majesty the Emperor arrived at the House of Peers, and after the officials paid their respects, Prime Minister Koiso presented the Imperial Speech. His Majesty immediately bestowed gracious words, and Deputy Speaker Sasaki respectfully accepted the Imperial Speech and withdrew. Thus, the opening ceremony concluded. At 11:15 AM, His Majesty returned to the Imperial Palace amidst the respectful farewell of the officials. The Imperial Speech bestowed by His Majesty the Emperor of Japan was as follows: "I hereby address the members of both the House of Peers and the House of Representatives at this Imperial Diet. Our soldiers on the expeditionary front are fighting bravely and fiercely, defeating powerful enemies everywhere and displaying our might. The construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is progressing rapidly, and our alliances with friendly nations are becoming stronger. This is what I always rejoice in. However, the enemy's resistance is becoming increasingly fierce, and the war situation is becoming more perilous. The time has come for the Empire to mobilize its total strength to achieve victory. Today, you should first rouse public anger and strengthen solidarity, resolutely shatter the enemy's wild ambitions, and secure the nation's destiny for eternity. I have instructed the Ministers of State to submit urgent bills related to the current situation to the Imperial Diet. You should understand my intentions, discuss harmoniously, and fulfill your duty of cooperation."</p>
<h3>Plenary Sessions of Both Houses</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - The 85th Extraordinary Session of the Japanese Diet held its opening ceremony on the 7th, receiving the gracious Imperial Speech. On this occasion of decisive victory, both the House of Peers and the House of Representatives resolutely rose up. The House of Representatives first held a plenary session at 11:30 AM, deciding on the drafting committee for the response to the Imperial Speech. A plenary session was held in the afternoon. Meanwhile, the House of Peers also convened a plenary session at 1:30 PM, resolving on the response to the Imperial Speech and electing Duke Tokugawa Kuniyuki as the temporary speaker, determining the chairmen of all committees and standing committees. Subsequently, Prime Minister Koiso delivered a speech amidst an atmosphere of tension and solemnity, clarifying general policy guidelines, expressing the Empire's belief in victory, and, based on the highest war guidance policies, demonstrating the grave determination to gather the total national strength for decisive battles. At the same time, in accordance with this intention, the Koiso Cabinet concretely announced its aspirations and internal and external strategies for dealing with the decisive battles. After the Prime Minister's policy speech, Minister Araki and Minister Yonai reported on the war situation. In their reports and speeches, they resolutely stated that the day of defeating the enemy was not far off. Thereupon, the Diet presented a resolution of gratitude and condolences to the soldiers, which was unanimously approved by the assembly. At this time, Viscount Okouchi Masatoshi rose to question the Prime Minister regarding the enhancement of military production and air raid countermeasures, which Prime Minister Koiso and the relevant ministers answered before the session adjourned. During the recess, the House of Representatives, after the House of Peers adjourned, held three more plenary sessions, in which, like the House of Peers, Prime Minister Koiso delivered a policy speech and the Ministers of the Army and Navy reported on the war situation. Simultaneously, a resolution of gratitude and condolences to the Imperial Army and Navy soldiers was presented and unanimously passed. Thus, the first day's agenda of the Extraordinary Session came to an end.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - Prime Minister Koiso delivered a policy speech on the 7th during the 85th Diet session, the gist of which is as follows: Japan has now reached a critical juncture of prosperity or decline. Under the protection of the spirits of our ancestors, maintaining the unparalleled national polity of the Japanese Empire and promoting its glorious and enduring history depend on this day. I, along with a trillion compatriots, share a firm belief in victory, unite as one, gather our total strength, and cooperate with the brave soldiers on the front lines, managing state affairs in order to achieve the complete accomplishment of the war's objectives. The purpose of the Greater East Asia War, as stated in the Declaration of War, is Japan's self-preservation and self-defense, an unavoidable uprising. At the same time, it has the great goal of revitalizing Greater East Asia. It is not only a battle for the survival of the Yamato race but also a decisive battle determining the fate of a billion people in Asia. Now that the war situation is critical, the Empire's prosperity or decline truly hinges on this day. To overcome this critical situation, the management of state affairs must be completely aligned with the objectives of the Greater East Asia War, in order to achieve harmony between military and civilian affairs, close coordination between command and state affairs, and ensure that war guidance is strong and without regrets. This is why the Supreme War Guidance Council was established. From now on, this council will manage state affairs, comprehensively coordinate command and state affairs, and determine fundamental policies. Therefore, all policies are based on this.</p>
<h3>Six Strategies</h3>
<p>The first strategy for the current war situation is to elevate morale and establish a national victory system. Elevating morale begins with thoroughly invigorating the concept of the national polity, overcoming all difficulties, and upholding the unparalleled national polity. This strong determination is the source of the belief in victory. The solidified concept of the national polity is the greatest combat power, supporting the eternal destiny of the nation. It is the enduring belief of a trillion compatriots for thousands of years. This great spirit gives rise to a pure national spirit, externally crushing the enemy's scheming, and internally eliminating selfishness and serving the public, completing the rock-solid system within the country. The second important strategy is to increase combat power. All efforts to strengthen combat power should be pursued with the full strength of the nation. Among these, the most important is the rapid increase of air power, relying on this to grasp the initiative in the war situation and favorably unfold the urgent decisive battles. As for all other facilities and industrial activities that cannot effectively contribute to the upcoming decisive battles, they should be stopped in order to shift towards key industries. These measures are being implemented gradually. The third important strategy is to increase food production and stabilize national life. Maintaining the minimum living standards of the people during wartime is an urgent task. A trillion compatriots have endured considerable hardship and maintained composure, continuing to advance on the path to victory. This is due to the soundness and excellence of the national character, which is truly commendable.</p>
<h3>National Mobilization</h3>
<p>The fourth important strategy is labor and national mobilization. At this critical juncture, no one, young or old, male or female, throughout the country should be idle. A trillion citizens should each be in their respective workplaces, dedicating their energy to fulfilling their respective missions, doing their utmost, and awaiting divine assistance. The government will constantly review the conscription system and the allocation and management of labor, striving for balance and improvement. At the same time, it plans all possible measures to thoroughly mobilize the nation's labor force. The fifth important strategy is to strengthen the defense of the homeland. Previously, when enemy aircraft attacked the western part of our homeland several times, officials and citizens alike were able to defend bravely, minimizing damage, which is something to be proud of. In the future, no matter how enemy aircraft attack, officials and citizens should continue to engage in homeland defense with ardent fighting spirit. The sixth important strategy is to use science and technology for mobilization. Modern warfare is almost entirely scientific warfare. The government strives to unify and utilize the scientific and technological capabilities of the Army and Navy, and to quickly transform Japan's science and technology into combat power, rapidly producing a large quantity of decisive battle weapons. In addition to establishing special organizations, it also encourages private individuals to invent new weapons. In this way, all the technologies of our Japanese compatriots can be used for the war, and its effects are worth anticipating.</p>
<h3>Wartime Diplomacy</h3>
<p>Finally, corresponding to domestic policies is the Empire's wartime diplomacy, which further strengthens ties with our ally Germany. We further hope that friendly nations in Greater East Asia will cooperate as one and exert their total strength to carry out the war. At the same time, we maintain friendly relations with neutral countries. Our ally Germany, amidst extreme difficulties due to changing circumstances, is still confident of ultimate victory and continues to fight bravely, which is commendable. Being able to exert its potential in difficult situations, we believe that the war situation will soon enter a favorable position. We remotely pray for its ultimate success. The nations and peoples of Greater East Asia remain unmoved in the current situation. Furthermore, amidst the evolution of this situation, they pledge to revive East Asia and form a unified entity with the Empire, strengthening the war system, which is something to be proud of. Thailand has previously reorganized its cabinet, but the new cabinet of Prime Minister Apaiwong, based on the alliance, adheres to the policy of jointly carrying out the war, which is evidence of the consolidated unity of Greater East Asia. The independence of Burma has already reached its first anniversary. Under the enthusiastic guidance of State Representative Ba Maw, overcoming many difficulties in the country, its development and determination to complete the war are very strong. The independence of the Philippines is also approaching its first year. Under the effective guidance of President Laurel, food and security under wartime conditions are on the right track, and it is actively preparing its war system, making it a powerful ally.</p>
<h3>East Asian Solidarity</h3>
<p>President Chandra Bose of the Provisional Government of Free India and others are fighting for the independence of India with admirable enthusiasm. The Imperial authorities will continue to provide strong assistance to achieve their goal of independence. Regarding the East Indies, the Empire, based on the long-cherished wishes of the indigenous people, especially their participation in political affairs, has made it clear that the residents of various regions understand the true intentions of the Empire. In order to complete the Greater East Asia War, we will consistently continue our efforts. Their cooperation with the current military administration is extraordinarily evident. Therefore, in order to ensure the eternal welfare of the East Indies people, we hereby declare that we will recognize their independence in the future. The Empire's policies towards various regions of Greater East Asia will remain unchanged in the future. Therefore, we will further promote the spirit of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration to meet the trust of the various nations and peoples of Greater East Asia. In this way, Greater East Asia, with the Empire as its core, will be firmly united under a firm belief in victory, gathering all its strength to advance towards the holy war for the revival of Greater East Asia, and we firmly believe that the eternal ideals of the immortal Empire will be manifested in the distant future.</p>
<h3>Army Minister Reports on the War Situation</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - Army Minister Sugiyama, on the 7th, reported the following gist of the war situation at the Extraordinary Diet session:</p>
<p>In the Central and Southern Pacific areas, the Japanese garrisons on New Britain and Bougainville Island inflicted heavy blows on the enemy. Bougainville and other key locations remain in our hands. However, it is deeply regrettable that the Japanese forces on Saipan Island, despite fighting bravely, were eventually occupied by American forces. The Japanese Army and Navy units on Guam and Tinian Island are now united as one, bravely fighting in difficult circumstances, and their morale remains extremely high in this fierce battle. According to American statements, the damage inflicted on the enemy on Saipan, Guam, and Tinian Island has reached over 30,000 troops. In the New Guinea area, since July, the Japanese forces have fiercely attacked the enemy near Aitape, inflicting heavy casualties. Under the cover of a powerful mobile fleet, American forces are gradually invading Hollandia, Sarmi, and the Biak area. Japanese Army units and Army and Navy air forces are now cooperating with each other in fierce fighting. Near Sarmi, the enemy was once repelled. On the coast of Biak, a small force inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy. The enemy is still gradually increasing its forces. Conversely, the Japanese forces are overcoming all difficulties and bravely launching repeated attacks against the enemy.</p>
<p>In the Burma area, in February of this year, the invading Yu forces in the Yoma Hills were annihilated. Subsequently, a preemptive strike was launched, attacking Imphal and Kohima. In April, Kohima and Bishnupur were captured. After that, fierce battles were fought with the Yu forces in the Kohima and Imphal areas. The Yu forces suffered approximately 30,000 casualties. About 100 large guns were captured and destroyed. At the same time, the enemy suffered a major strategic blow. After achieving such a huge victory, the forces in that area are now returning to their original defenses. Also, the enemy has landed airborne units near the Cassar and the Tagon Valley, and the Yu forces' 5th Division, equipped with American equipment, and the other 15th Division of the Yu forces on the Nujiang Front have successively invaded the Japanese positions. The Japanese forces on the Nujiang Front fought bravely with a small force, using key locations as bases, launching repeated counterattacks. As a result, the airborne units that invaded Cassar have been severely battered. The Japanese forces have repeatedly attacked the Yu forces that invaded from the Fugong Front, inflicting heavy damage. Currently, the Japanese forces are preparing for the next operation on the southern, eastern, and western lines of Myitkyina. Since the end of last year, the damage to the Yu forces, according to the latest Yu statements, has been approximately 80,000 killed and wounded, and over 300,000 sick.</p>
<p>On the Chinese Mainland</p>
<p>The Kyōhin Line Operation began in late April, and Luoyang was captured on May 25th. Subsequently, the Guangdong-Hankou Railway Line Operation began in late May, and Hengyang was captured on August 8th. This operation completely thwarted the Yu-American air force's attempts to obstruct Japanese maritime traffic and air raids on the Japanese homeland, causing extremely great losses. As of today, the Japanese forces have sacrificed 7,350 men in this operation. The Yu forces suffered even greater losses, with approximately 175,000 killed and captured, and 750 large guns, 3,000 machine guns, and 37,000 rifles seized. Also, recently, enemy air forces from the homeland and Manchuria have attacked Kitakyushu and Southern Manchuria five times, and the Japanese air defense units have bravely intercepted them, resulting in the downing of over 30 B-29 long-range bombers. There were also Japanese aircraft that crashed into enemy aircraft, demonstrating their vigorous attacking spirit.</p>
<p>Regarding air operations, around the end of last year, the American air force's first-line strength on all fronts in Greater East Asia was approximately 5,000 aircraft. In the Solomon Islands, Bismarck Archipelago, and the eastern part of New Guinea, there were approximately 1,500 aircraft. The Japanese Army and Navy air units in that area have cooperated with each other, and since the end of last year, they have often engaged enemy aircraft several times their number. During this period, the Army alone has shot down and destroyed over 1,000 enemy aircraft. However, due to the strength of forces, supply capabilities, and base capabilities, there are unavoidable difficulties in exerting combat power. In front of Burma, there are approximately 800 to 1,000 enemy aircraft. The Japanese Army air units, although limited by the strength of forces and other difficulties, bravely resisted several times the enemy's strength. Since the end of last year, 530 enemy aircraft have been shot down, and approximately 200 have been destroyed. In China, the Yu forces have been rapidly increasing their base strength since this spring. Until recently, the total number of Yu aircraft has reached over 700, including at least 100 or more B-29 aircraft. The Japanese air force units often fought enemy aircraft with skillful tactics. Since the end of last year, they have shot down 500 and destroyed 1,000.</p>
<p>The Kuril Islands Area</p>
<p>Japanese aircraft and the Navy are cooperating with each other, currently intercepting 4 enemy aircraft in that area. The above is the combat situation of the Japanese Army air units. Since the end of last year, the Army's air and ground units have shot down 2,700 aircraft, while the Japanese have lost 604 aircraft. In short, the enemy's counterattacks in the Pacific and Mainland areas are extremely fierce. Today is a good opportunity to shatter the enemy's ambitions. The Japanese Army is determined to unite as one, overcome all difficulties, and complete the great task of defending the homeland. The enemy's personnel losses have increased dramatically, and they have unfavorable conditions such as extended war lines and supply lines. Conversely, the Japanese have strategic advantages due to the smaller war lines, reduced supply lines, and strengthened operational bases. The Army and Navy are working closely together, gathering all combat power to deal with the enemy. At the same time, our entire nation is working diligently together to increase aircraft production. Therefore, we firmly believe that now is a God-given opportunity to defeat the enemy and complete the war.</p>
<h3>East Japanese Army Breaks into Haikou City</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 7th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from Chongqing, the elite of the Japanese East Zhejiang forces, after capturing Qingtian on August 27th, continued to pursue the Yu forces along the Ou River. On the 4th, they broke into Haikou City, 20 kilometers southeast of Lishui. Fierce fighting is currently underway.</p>
<p>Japanese Aircraft Bomb Ganzhou Airfield Heavily</p>
<p>China Frontline Base, 7th (Central News Agency) - Japanese bomber squadrons attacked the Ganzhou Airfield, a Yu frontline base, at dawn on the 6th, bombing its protective areas and the vicinity of the runway. It seems to have suffered considerable damage. However, due to poor visibility, the results of the battle could not be confirmed. All Japanese aircraft returned safely to base.</p>
<h3>Three Budget Supplementary Proposals Submitted to the House of Representatives by the Japanese Cabinet; Deliberation to Begin This Afternoon</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Cabinet submitted the following budget proposals to the House of Representatives on the 7th: Supplementary proposal for the general budget of revenue and expenditure for the 19th year of Showa (33rd year of the Republic of China); Supplementary proposal for the special account budget of revenue and expenditure for the 19th year of Showa; Supplementary proposal for the temporary military expenditure budget, and one other item.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese House of Representatives held a general consultation meeting of budget committee candidates at 10:30 AM on the 6th to discuss the operational guidelines of the budget committee, the objectives of questioning and deliberation, etc. As a result, it was agreed that, in view of the fundamental purpose of the decisive battle parliament, key points should be selected to concentrate discussion. The questioners, the order of questioning, and the items to be questioned will be drafted by the chairman and directors and then submitted to the whole body for discussion. Budget deliberation will begin on the afternoon of the 8th. The key points of the deliberation items are: A. Establishing a sure-win domestic system; B. Increasing military production, with special attention to increasing the production of aircraft; C. The food problem. Furthermore, within the establishment of a sure-win domestic system, opinions will be concentrated and frankly reflect public opinion from the spiritual aspect on matters such as wartime guidance, national movements, rectifying morals, guiding public opinion, and raising national morale, striving to give full play to the functions of the parliament. The general meeting of this item has considerable expectations for the deliberation and questioning of the temporary military expenditure.</p>
<p>Actively Promoting Agricultural Production</p>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) – The supplementary budget proposal for the general account of the 19th year, submitted by Japan in this temporary parliament, includes 62,000 yuan for temporary parliamentary expenses; the remaining 785 million yuan is entirely for food production expenses. According to this plan, it is expected that an additional 1.7 million koku of rice and 1.1 million koku of wheat will be harvested. In addition, to ensure the labor force in agricultural work, Prime Minister Koiso's proposal will be considered to organize Class A food production teams, mainly composed of successors to agriculture, and increase the number of team members from 30,000 to 60,000 to be dispatched at any time and anywhere. In addition, about 500,000 young people aged 17 and 18 in cities and towns who cannot be incorporated into the Class A production teams will form Class B production teams to engage in food production work for two months during the busy farming season. Furthermore, 80,000 students from agricultural schools, under the principle of year-round mobilization, will use farmland as classrooms to learn practical agricultural techniques. The central purpose of this increased production campaign is to complete the task of ensuring increased production by dispatching agricultural soldier teams. In addition, a system will be established to lend draft horses to livestock farmers without charge and to distribute chickens at cost. At the same time, an average of 210 female agricultural technicians will be selected from each prefecture to strengthen increased production measures.</p>
<h3>After Seizing Changtang Street, Japanese Troops Occupy Qiyang; Baishui on the South Bank of the Xiang River Falls</h3>
<p>Hunan Front, 7th (Central News Agency) – After the Japanese rapid forces seized Changtang Street on the 3rd, they immediately pursued the 46th Army and occupied Qiyang, a key point on the Xiang-Gui Railway, on the morning of the 5th. This location is an advanced base for the Chongqing-U.S. Air Force, only 30 kilometers from Lingling.</p>
<p>Hunan Front, 7th (Central News Agency) – The elite Japanese troops in Hunan, in response to the occupation of Qiyang, also began operations near Jinlansi, defeating the Chongqing 58th Division and advancing more than 50 kilometers southwest along the Xiang-Gui Railway. On the morning of the 5th, they arrived at Wenmingwei, 20 kilometers northwest of Qiyang. Another Japanese westward advancing force crossed Baishui City on the 4th and seized Changliujie, 3 kilometers away from Qiyang, at the same time in the evening, cutting off the Chongqing army's retreat route. The battle situation with Qiyang as the center is becoming increasingly urgent.</p>
<p>Hunan Front, 7th (Central News Agency) – After the vanguard of the Japanese troops in Hunan occupied Changning, they continued to advance towards the mountainous area of Bacheng. On the morning of the 4th, they occupied Baishui City, 40 kilometers west of Changning. The main force of the 14th Division of the 31st Army of Chongqing were all repelled. Baishui City is located between Changning and Lingling and is a key transportation hub on the south bank of the Xiang River. At present, the artery of the southeastern military of the Chongqing army has been completely cut off.</p>
<h3>Navy Minister Reports on the War Situation</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Navy Minister, Admiral Minei, reported the general outline of the war situation to the 85th Diet as follows: A brief description of the general war situation since the last Diet session and a sincere disclosure of my beliefs are as follows:</p>
<p>Central Pacific</p>
<p>In the region, since one corner of the Marshall Islands fell into enemy hands in early February, enemy mobile forces have continued to attack the Mariana Islands, the Caroline Islands, and Nanto Islands, etc., to weaken the Japanese advanced bases. By mid-June, the enemy occupied Saipan under the cover of a large mobile force based on a dozen aircraft carriers and battleships. Subsequently, they landed on Tinian and Guam, but the Japanese army is still in its old position. The enemy forces in New Guinea also echoed the operations in the Central Pacific, invading Biak Island in late May, and advancing to Sansapor in northwestern New Guinea in early August. The Japanese army and navy fought bravely in these battles, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy, but the Japanese army also suffered many casualties.</p>
<p>Japanese Combined Fleet</p>
<p>The naval forces, in coordination with the Japanese army in the Mariana area, were also active, but it is regrettable that the enemy landing forces could not be eliminated due to the failure to adequately supply air power. As a result of the aforementioned operations, the enemy forces have obtained powerful air bases in the Mariana area and northwestern New Guinea, and have gradually expanded their air power circle, causing the air raids on the Ogasawara Islands, Iwo Jima area, the Philippines area, and the Caroline Islands area to become increasingly fierce. The enemy in the North Pacific continued to conduct frequent air raids and occasionally shelled key points in the North Kuril Islands, requiring strict vigilance. Warplanes from the Indian Ocean area to Sumatra and Central Java have also intensified their activities. During this period, enemy submarines were extremely active. The navy, with the cooperation of the army and other forces, desperately defended and attacked, achieving the definite result of</p>
<p>Sinking Enemy Submarines</p>
<p>One hundred and thirty, destroying forty-two ships. However, further efforts are needed in the future to achieve unprecedented results. The Japanese submarine force also performs various important tasks in the vast ocean. Recently, it firmly attacked two enemy aircraft carriers, one battleship, and one cruiser, destroying about twice that number of ships. In addition, it achieved the result of sinking about twenty-four enemy ships, totaling 180,000 tons. Frankly speaking, in the war situation since this spring, although our army has achieved significant local results in various aspects, from a general perspective, the current situation still requires sudden awareness. There will be many difficulties in the war situation in the future. However, due to the brave and skillful fighting of the front-line soldiers, the stubborn enemy relying on material resources is worried. The tangible and intangible damages are both heavy and large. The deeper the enemy army penetrates.</p>
<p>The Japanese Defense Perimeter</p>
<p>The more difficulties and weaknesses within are exposed. I believe that defeating the many with the few is the wonderful meaning of ancient Japanese military strategy. The Imperial Navy's painstaking efforts over the years have also been in this regard. By comparing the strengths and weaknesses of both sides in terms of material and spiritual aspects, and seeing through the enemy's hidden difficulties and weaknesses, I am confident that the Imperial Navy will launch sure-win strategies in the future. What I want to say especially today is that everyone knows that the essential elements of combat, that is, obtaining air supremacy on land and sea in today's war situation, are necessary conditions for combat. Without such air supremacy, aircraft, needless to say, and any elite battleships and superior mechanized forces cannot be expected. From the daily war situation, one can understand why there is a demand for rapidly replenishing new and advanced aircraft. Currently,</p>
<p>The Naval Air Force, fights the enemy day and night. As the war situation becomes increasingly fierce, the consumption of aircraft has gradually increased, and the number of mechanical failures has exceeded expectations. I hope that the one hundred million citizens will cooperate with each other and transport the aircraft they expect to the front-line troops, so as to allow them to be fully active. Under the Emperor's majesty, I pledge with the citizens to rapidly replenish all war preparations with zealous trials, and to integrate this with the front-line troops, seize the weaknesses of the enemy expeditionary forces, and inflict thorough pain. At the same time, I hope that the country should also take victory as the ultimate goal, and exert a firm and persistent spirit, each performing their duties, and making</p>
<p>Efforts to ensure victory. The Japanese Combined Fleet, under the command of Commander-in-Chief Mota, has extremely high morale, and all have ignited the belief in destroying the enemy, which is what I am most gratified about.</p>
<h3>Japanese Government Commends the Ministry of Transport and Communications, Shimonoseki Facilities Department</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Information Bureau announced on the 6th that the Prime Minister, in accordance with Article 1 of the Ordinance for the Commendation of Meritorious Government Officials and Soldiers, awarded a certificate of commendation to the Shimonoseki Local Facilities Department under the Ministry of Transport and Communications.</p>

<h3>Implementing the Greater East Asia Declaration, Japan to Allow East Indies Independence; Chairman Chen and Dean Zhou Issue Statements</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Prime Minister Koiso declared in his policy speech to the current Japanese temporary parliament that he will recognize the independence of the East Indies in the future. This is another concrete proof of the Allied nations' assistance to the oppressed peoples of East Asia to achieve independence and liberation. Our National Government Chairman Chen made a special statement on this matter. In addition to expressing admiration for Prime Minister Koiso's grand declaration, he also urged the compatriots across the country to recognize the future of the nation and the nation, and its responsibility for the Greater East Asia Declaration, and to strive even harder to complete the war. The record is as follows: Prime Minister Koiso of the Allied Nations, in his policy address to the 85th Temporary Parliament yesterday, in order to further develop the efforts of the Allied governments since last year to allow the original inhabitants of the East Indies to participate in political affairs in accordance with their long-cherished wishes, solemnly declared that they will recognize the independence of East Asia in the future. This is the Allied Nations' assistance to the East, sparing no effort to take on the forefront of defending East Asia. The Greater East Asia Conference was convened ten months ago, and the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration was issued, jointly establishing the basic principles of mutual assistance, mutual benefit, and common defense among the East Asian nations. This statement also aims to fulfill every word of the Greater East Asia Declaration from the beginning of the Greater East Asia War. At this decisive stage, the clear and powerful influence it gives to the East Asian nations and the fatal blow it gives to the Anglo-American aggressionists are extremely significant, not only making the East Indian people in the midst of striving for liberation jump for joy.</p>
<p>We must deeply recognize that this war is related to the survival of the entire East Asia, and it is also the boundary between independence and slavery for any nation in the East Asian sphere. Only through the common struggle of the East Asian nations can the scourge of aggression be eradicated and the overall liberation of East Asia be ensured. Only by ensuring the overall liberation of East Asia can we ensure the independent survival and stable development of each nation, and further contribute to the stability and peace of the world through the stability and peace of East Asia. This cannot be achieved by empty words. Only with ability can there be gains, and only with sacrifice can a price be obtained. Therefore, in addition to expressing admiration for Prime Minister Koiso's powerful statement, I deeply wish that all our citizens will recognize the future of the nation and its responsibility for the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, and strive even harder. I also deeply hope that our East Asian nations will unite even more to complete the war.</p>
<p>Dean Zhou Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency) – The general idea is that Prime Minister Koiso's statement that he will allow the East Indies to be independent in the future is a epoch-making measure to implement the sacred purpose of the Greater East Asia War, which is deeply admired. The purpose of the Greater East Asia War is to liberate the countries and nations that were under British and American domination. If the East Asian countries and nations still do not achieve independence and freedom after the British and American forces are driven out of East Asia, it will violate the sacred purpose of the Greater East Asia War. Prime Minister Koiso's statement is in line with the spirit of the Greater East Asia War. In addition to expressing admiration, we deeply hope that the East Asian countries and nations will assist in the concrete realization of this statement, and further strive to assist the Allied nation Japan in completing the victory of the Greater East Asia War, so as to determine the co-prosperity of the East Asian countries and nations.</p>
<p>Minister Lin Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency) – After hearing Prime Minister Koiso's statement at the temporary parliament that he will recognize the independence of the East Indies in the future, Minister Lin Yifu pointed out two points, the general idea being: Japan's move is an aid based on a moral spirit. Our country should recognize the sincerity of the Allied nation, strive for national independence, and seek East Asian liberation together.</p>
<h3>Train Frequency Reduced; Inland River Transportation Smooth; Water Transportation Capacity Increasing Daily</h3>
<p>Since the frequency of trains on various lines of the Central China Railway has been reduced, transportation relies more on shipping than before. To understand the situation of Shanghai's external water transportation, a Central News Agency reporter visited Shanghai Inland River Steamship Company. According to the person in charge of the company, although Shanghai's commercial transportation used to rely on land transportation, due to the location of loading and unloading points, the water freight was high. In fact, goods from Kyoto, Shanghai, Hangzhou and other places are all transported to Shanghai by inland river transport ships, because the loading and unloading locations are mostly at the docks, which is more convenient for transporting goods into warehouses, and the freight is low. Therefore, although the company feels the same difficulties as the railway in terms of fuel management, in order to promote the mission of water transportation, it still fully maintains the past routes. Therefore, since the frequency of trains has been reduced, the water transportation capacity has not only not decreased, but has been increasing daily. Especially in the past month, passengers traveling to and from Kyoto, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Jiaxing and other places have mostly switched to inland river transport ships because it is difficult to buy train tickets. The latest statistics show that more than 315,000 passengers have traveled to the above-mentioned places by transport ships, which shows that water transportation is convenient and does not affect travel. At present, in order to actively promote inland river transportation, the company has specially adjusted the original frequency. Although it feels the lack of fuel, it still does not interrupt the original Hangzhou line.</p>
<p>The company's current routes to Central China include:</p>
<p>Shanghai-Suzhou Line: This line takes Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, and Shanghai as its center points, connecting Changshu, Kunshan, Qingpu, Jiangyin, Danyang, Jiangkou, Sanjiangyin, Qishuyan, Yixing, Taicang, Shaxi, Jintan, Jurong, Huangdu, Jiaxing, Hupu, and Piaoyang.</p>
<p>Huangpu River Line: This line takes Jiaxing, Hangzhou, and Shanghai as its center points, connecting Jinshan, Jiaxing, Huzhou, Sanqiqiao, Minhang, Songjiang, Pingwang, Jiangbian, Zhuji, Jingjiang, Chuansha, Datuan, Chongde, and Changan.</p>
<p>Yangtze River Line: This line takes Wuhu, Nanjing, and Zhenjiang as its center points, connecting Pukou, Yangzhou, Nanjing, Gaoyou, Taixian, Yukou, Chongde, Tianshenggang, Kouan, and Tongjiangji.</p>
<p>Hankou Line: This line takes Hankou as its center point, connecting Jiujiang, Xindi, Shihui Xiang, Hukou, and Shashi.</p>
<p>Jiangbei Line: This line takes Yangzhou, Dongtai, Nan Tong, and Taixian as its center points, connecting Gaoyou, Baoying, Xinghua, Jurong, Huaiyin, Huaian, Dongtai, Yancheng, Bining, and Haian.</p>
<p>Huai River Line: This line takes Bengbu as its center point, connecting Huaiyuan, Xiahe, Fengtai, Taixian, Linhuaiguan, Wuhe, and Zhangfengtan.</p>
<h3>This Period's Household Sugar Ration Expected to Increase</h3>
<p>With the Mid-Autumn Festival approaching, the demand for sugar among the people is urgent. After consultation between the Municipal Goods Allocation Office and the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office, in order to meet the demand, the amount of sugar rationed per household in this period is expected to increase to half a jin per person in principle, and it is generally expected to be available for sale in mid-month.</p>
<h3>Yongshou Street: A Den of Iniquity Busted</h3>
<p>The Narcotics Investigation Section of the Judicial Office of the Municipal Police Bureau received a tip-off that someone was secretly opening a heroin den in the cooking shed at No. 103, Dongju Lane, Yongshou Street (formerly Dongzilaihuo Street). After receiving the report, the bureau dispatched a large number of detectives to the address at 2:30 PM yesterday and arrested the main culprit, Zhu Rongsheng (also known as Big Fatty, with a dragon tattoo on his arm), and three accomplices, fifteen customers, eighteen heroin pipes, and multiple packages of heroin on the spot. According to Zhu Rongsheng, the heroin was supplied by a Korean surnamed Jin, but Jin escaped and has not been captured. The bureau is currently investigating.</p>
<h3>Public Works Bureau Holds Registration of Well Merchants and Native Wells; Random Checks to Be Conducted at Any Time to Emphasize Hygiene</h3>
<p>Since the merger of the First District Public Works Office, all public utilities in the city have been unified under the management of the Public Works Bureau. It is reported that the water supply affairs in the city are currently being planned and managed by the bureau. All well companies, water pipe merchants, etc., must apply for registration with the bureau in accordance with the regulations before they are allowed to operate. If there are underground water pipes and sanitary equipment in the operation and repair of houses and other projects, or reconstruction and other works, the contractor should also prepare a detailed drawing and submit it to the bureau for approval before construction can begin. Those who have not completed the procedures in accordance with the regulations must apply for registration with the bureau. Fearing that merchants and people do not understand the procedures, so as to cause the rules to be violated, the bureau also sent a letter to the Public Works Bureau, in the future, if merchants and people apply for building or repairing licenses, and there are incidental water supply equipment, such as opening artesian wells, and setting up tap water pipes and other projects, they should guide merchants and people to register with the bureau. As for the stores and households in the city, due to the limited amount of tap water, they have opened native wells one after another. In the past, the authorities strictly prohibited native wells because the city has tap water equipment, in order to emphasize hygiene. Now, at this extraordinary time, it is specially rewarded to open up, but it is only limited to washing and industrial use. The Municipal Public Works Bureau, in order to understand the details of the native wells in the city, recently held a registration of the native well equipment owned by the owners of the whole city. If the wells have been built or are being prepared and excavated, please go to the second section of the bureau to collect the application form as soon as possible. After the bureau organizes the completion, it will cooperate with the Hygiene Bureau to send personnel to conduct random inspections at any time. Those who do not meet the regulations will be banned.</p>
<h3>Regarding Countermeasures Against Commodity Prices, Thorough Research is Underway; Dean Zhou Answers Key Points</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency) – Zhou Fohai, Acting Dean of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, met with domestic and foreign reporters in the capital in the Central Storage Conference Room at 11:00 AM on the 7th and answered various points of concern to the reporters in detail. The details are as follows: (1) Regarding the gold price issue, there has been an abnormal phenomenon recently, with soaring prices, which has a huge impact on commodity prices. The reason is: some people are hoarding and manipulating. The Shanghai authorities once severely investigated and punished this; due to the psychological relationship of the people, the trend of competition is increasing. The authorities are planning countermeasures for this.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the problem of commodities, it can be said from two aspects: currency and materials. The current rise in commodity prices is by no means inflation, because the circulation area of ​​Central Reserve Vouchers is increasing, and the amount of banknotes issued should increase accordingly. Self cannot be called inflation. Seeing the high interest rates in the financial situation in Shanghai and other places can be used as proof of no support. Therefore, the main reason for the rise in commodity prices is the lack of materials and hoarding by the general public. How can commodity prices be stabilized in the future? We must work hard to increase production and save consumption. However, the simple issue of increasing production is extremely complicated, such as the issues of fuel, raw materials, and transportation, which must be resolved one by one. Regarding commodity price countermeasures and the entire specific plan, the authorities are conducting thorough research. (3) The ratio of Central Reserve Vouchers to</p>
<p>The Japanese yen will never be changed because a country's change will affect economic chaos and soaring prices, but the impact will not only be on our country, but also Japan will be considerably affected. During my visit to Japan, I met with Prime Minister Koiso and Ministers Ishiwatari and Shigetsu, and we agreed on this matter, and we are more determined not to change the original exchange rate. (4 Regarding the establishment of the banking industry in various places, the establishment of new banks has long been suspended in the Kyoto and Shanghai areas, and places with fewer banks and money shops are also subject to conditions. Restriction (5) Regarding the 400 million yen loan from the Japanese Bank to the Central Storage Bank, it is used as a preparation for the development of the Central Storage Bank. In the future, the Central Storage Bank's reserve fund will be more sufficient, and its credit will increase day by day, needless to say. (6) Regarding the recovery of currency, the Ministry of Finance and the Central Storage Bank have made great efforts. In ordinary countries, the strategy for recovering currency should be to issue public bonds and encourage savings. Regarding the first point, because the National Government's finances are very sufficient, there is no need to issue public bonds. At present, only construction public bonds are issued, and the number issued is not very large. Regarding the area of ​​preparing for livestock, the authorities have already held it, and it is a good way to do so. At present, regarding the recovery of currency, the authorities have implemented the third step, which is to</p>
<p>Buy out materials and recover currency. I discussed this with Minister of Finance Ishiwatari, and the Japanese side will cooperate to transport a large amount of materials for the purpose of recovering currency. (7) Regarding taxation, in order to reduce the burden on the people, in terms of taxation, in order to reduce the burden on the people, in terms of taxation, physical objects are levied, such as the land tax that has been levied in Jiangsu and Anhui provinces. In the future, any improper taxes will be cancelled. Finally, Zhou talked about a profound feeling during his visit to Japan, saying: "I once visited</p>
<p>Prime Minister Tojo Daigo, it took 50 minutes by private car and more than 2 hours by train. After Daigo retired, he no longer had a car to ride. Although the military department was willing to borrow a car, Daigo refused, so he expressed his apology to me, saying that he could not answer the visit. This is enough to prove that Japan's political organization and situation are good, and it can be imitated by our country."</p>

<h3>Chongqing to Comprehensively Reorganize the Army</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 7th (Central News Agency) – It was recently reported that the Chongqing government implemented a comprehensive reorganization of the Chongqing army on September 1.

<h3>Reader's Scholarship News "Silver Sea's Eternity" Premieres Today Enthusiastic Purchase of Tickets from Industry and Commerce</h3>
<p>The China Film Company's latest blockbuster "Silver Sea's Eternity" will premiere at the Grand Light Cinema starting today, with three screenings daily. For today and tomorrow, the company has agreed to donate all proceeds from the balcony seats to the Shen Xin Two Newspapers Scholarship Fund and the Vagrant Labor Camp Fund. Everyone knows this film features a grand gathering of twenty-six stars singing, but few know that this film has other unspeakable grand scenes. According to someone involved in the production, it was directed through the combined efforts of Mr. Zhang Shankun and more than ten other directors. All manpower and material resources of the China Film Company's four major studios were also fully mobilized to participate in the performance. In terms of manpower alone, there were more than a thousand people, both above and below, making it truly an unparalleled and majestic film, undoubtedly creating a new record in the history of Chinese cinema. For those who have never watched domestic films, we hope you can spare two hours to give it a try, which may allow you to understand the degree of progress in the Chinese film industry.</p>
<p>The Shen Xin Two Newspapers sent letters to the industry and commerce sectors the day before yesterday, encouraging the sale of three types of special seating tickets priced at three thousand, one thousand five hundred, and one thousand yuan. Yesterday, the recipients of the tickets constantly came to the Social Service Department of this newspaper to deliver the ticket prices, shoulder to shoulder, filling the doorway, demonstrating the enthusiasm of all sectors for doing good deeds. Their generous donations are truly immeasurable. The names of those who purchased tickets will be announced one by one in this newspaper as a sign of gratitude. However, there is one more thing to say. A small number of ticket recipients returned the tickets. We believe that "scholarship assistance" is an obligation that everyone should fulfill, unlike other wasteful expenditures. Why not save on unnecessary expenses and use the money for meaningful "scholarship assistance"? It's truly a win-win to both watch a famous film and contribute to a good cause. Today, regular seats at the Grand Light Cinema, priced at 300 and 500 yuan, will be sold at the cinema gate. Special seats priced at 1,000 yuan and above, in addition to being sold on behalf of the Shen Bao Social Service Department, will also have a portion of good seats reserved for sale at the Grand Light box office. We invite enthusiastic individuals to purchase tickets directly from the cinema.</p>

Recently, he generously donated 100,000 yuan to benefit poor students and cultivate talents for the country, which is deeply admired.</p>
