<h3>雷伊泰島大風雨　日軍作果敢奇襲　布羅音等敵機塲陷於混亂</h3>
<p>菲律賓四日中央社電數月來雷伊泰島發生大風雨，爲新幾內亞·所羅門各地所空前未見者，此等惡劣天氣，對日軍將兵作正如天助，日軍肉搏挺身隊，利用此種暴風雨，速續攻擊敵人。暴風雨及黑夜正如天賜武器，給予敵人之打擊極大，加以日軍挺身隊之奇襲，已使敵混亂不堪。北部雷伊泰島敵陣地之營幕物資堆積所，敵軍雖屢决加強警戒，但均遭日勇士相繼破壞或起大火。雷伊泰島破壞敵軍運輸路之偉大任務，即爲日軍勇士之使命，故日軍挺身隊勇士給予美軍之雷伊泰島作戰之極大陣礙，前綫日軍將士均以雷伊泰島作爲美軍太平洋侵攻作戰之墳裏，故均反復展開壯烈之戰鬥。</p>
<p>菲律賓基地四日中央社電　日軍空挺緻於布羅脊及塔拉克兩敵機塲附近，果敢强行上陸奇襲後，敵軍陣地已陷混亂狀態，更由於日軍勇士畫伏夜出，繼突入襲擊，敵軍恐怖已達極點。據日軍偵察機二日報吿稱，前於布羅音及塔拉克兩機塲陸上機多架，今已影跡皆無，由此亦可知敵軍恐懼日軍勇士突擊情形之一斑。</p>
<p>菲島基地四日中央社電　雷伊泰島西方加麥泰斯海之日空海軍，在十一月三十日起，二日間擊沉敵驅逐艦一艘，魚雷艇七艘，運輸船一艘，擊毀魚雷艇四艘，三日已由大本營發表矣，而日軍機隊二日晚迄三日晨，仍在追擎敵敗艦艇，又擊沉驅逐艦一艘，擊毀一艘，其後依然陸續進攻，於低空以機槍猛擊，故敵艦艇悉皆破毀敗走。</p>
<h3>神風有功隊員　分別晉二級　日海軍省發表</h3>
<p>東京四日中央社電　日海軍省三日發表：此次神風特別攻擊隊員有功者，分別予以進級，海軍中尉久納好孚，任海軍少佐。海軍一等飛行兵曹谷暢夫，加薩總文，中野磐雄，宮川正，勝又富作，鹽田實，山澤貞勝，廣田幸宜，山下憲行，崎田淸及海軍上等飛行兵曹大谷寅雄行，二等飛行兵曹三浦淸三九，任海軍少尉。海軍飛行兵長永峰肇，海軍上等飛行兵大黑繁男，海軍飛行兵長勝浦茂夫，鈴木鐘一，櫻森文雄，大下春男任海軍飛行兵曹長。</p>

<p>漢口四日中央社電　盟邦畑元帥以駐渝美機，在漢巿商業繁盛人烟稠密地區，肓目投彈，致使無辜民衆，遭受空前巨災，慘無人通。烟元帥爲軫念災黎，特捐贈國幣一百萬元，作爲撫濟之金。茲悉該款除由楊省長領受，幷代全體哀鴻表示謝意外，同時即轉飭所屬，積梅辦理救濟工作，以期災民得沾實惠。</p>
<h3>滇緬公路一帶　攻防戰激烈</h3>
<p>緬甸前綫基地四日中央社電　在芒巿周邊繼續激戰之日軍精銳，猛烈邀擊執拗反攻之渝雲南遠征軍，十七日又痛擊滇緬公路某要衝，將於該地構築前進陣地之渝軍逐出，將之奪取，因此，以該地天然險要爲患，企圖强行進攻之渝軍野心，不久即被完全擊破。一月初旬滇細公路一帶之攻防戰極其激烈，按渝軍於開始總反攻朱幾之十一月一日起十四間，來屍巳達一千七百十一具，戰鬥之激烈於此可見矣。北緬之日軍，更以奇製突擊作戰，擾亂英印第三十六師之主力，使之後退，企圖奪回阿卡布之英印二十五，二十六旅及西非八十二師，已被日軍殲滅，日軍之奇製，業使敵陣受甚大之牽制，然而誓必奪回阿卡布之敵軍陣地，在二十，二十一兩日，曾以百餘人之少數部隊，擬於孟多南十公里之印典登陸，然亦被日軍擊退。</p>
<h3>空襲東京敵機　擊落廿一架</h3>
<p>東京四日中央社電　日大本營四日下午四詩半發表：（一）於於三日敵機空襲東京及東京附近地區，收獲之戰果判明如决：包括三日之大本營發表，擊落敵機二十一架，內未經證實者七架，日方自炸未歸還者六架（包括拼撞在內）。（二）此次戰鬥中，參加拼撞者，現經判明計陸軍中尉四之宮徹（生還），陸軍軍曹沃本政美，陸軍伍長板垣政雄（生還）。</p>
<p>東京四日中央社電　馬里亞納之敵B29型機，三日下午二時起至三時三十分，的一小時有半，再度空襲東京，以七十架左右，分爲十隊，自七千至一萬米之高空，盲目投下炸彈及燒夷彈，大部轟炸郊外，日軍制空陣在東京上空邀擊敵机，庆开壮烈空战，同时并以凖确之防空砲火齊射，當擊落敵機十五架，俟調查詳細後，仍有增大可能。此次敵機來襲，日方損害極輕，僅襲處發生火災，經軍官民一致協力，已予撲滅。按敵機空襲東京，對日軍要點之轟炸，已達四次，共爲二百架，日軍第一次擊落其十四架，此次擊洛十五架，共二十九架，已佔其總數之十分之一點五，尤其此次日方邀擊及防空砲火之威力，較前二一、尤爲增大，在上空極强之速風中空戰，擊落其十五架之多，予巿民以極大之信賴感，由此可知日方之邀擊態勢，在軍官民一致協力下，已日諸完備。</p>
<p>美指軍官承認空襲日困難</p>
<p>中央社訊渝美空軍自喪失空製日本本土最短護距離之西南基地羣後，即積極從事超空要塞B29型機之增强，現在成都約有B29型機百五六十架，其他基地配置B24型，B25型及P51型，P40型等約四百架乃至六百架，最近空襲日本本土及滿者，洲僅爲B29型機。又擔當最近空襲東京之美太平洋航空隊之指揮官稱，日本擁有與B29型機上昇高度相同之高射砲，因此美機於東京上空常遭猛烈之砲火攻擊，而申述空製日本本土之困難性。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>重點主義的米糧配給</h3>
<p>戰時由於物資來源的減少，爲避免濫用浪費，使寶貴的物資都能用之於正當的需要，於是實行物資配給制。我國有些地方質施重要物資的配給，也有相當時日了，尤其上海，現在於市政府有專司物資配給的物品配給處，不能不說已具相當規模。</p>
<p>目前物資來源愈益困難，民生益見艱　，合理而適度的物資配給，越發感覺重要；不過，檢討往所有配給措施，需要改正的地方實在不少，這裏就米糧配給一項，提供一些改革的意見，以供中日當局的參考。</p>
<p>現行米糧配給制度，最易使人感到未盡合理的缺憾，除數量不够需要，期間未能準確以外，就是支配的不合理。惟其因爲數量不足期間不準，支配就格外需要合理，以資彌補。如果米糧配給，達到了準期足量，滿足了每個人的需要以後，那末，就沒有支配合理與吾的問題了。換句話說，在配給制度沒有達到足量之前，支配方面不能採取絕對普遍的方式，其間應有合理的區別，採取重點主義。營如富有階級，他們根本不需要配給米，就是配到以後，惡其粗糙，不過以之喂養狗猫雞鴨而已。又如雜糧配給中之六谷粉及黑麵粉，更視伺糟糠，委棄不顧，至多備爲傭僕食糧。而貧苦階級，則需要萬分，望配給如雲覧，無論糙米雜糧，愛惜如生命。在這種情形之下，自然需要合理的支配了。</p>
<p>目前的配給制度，除普遍的户口配給之外，另有特種配給。特種配給的用意，原爲補助某種人員工作繁重而生活清古者，譬如公敎人員，另有特種配給。這種制度設置，已經表示普遍配給制度的未盡合理。所以，對於現行配給制度，進一步的合理調整，採取重點主義，實有從速考慮之需要。我們相信支配合理以後，可以減少米糧間題給予貧苦市民的嚴盾威脅，未始非安定社會的主要途徑。</p>
<p>足量準期及支配合理，應是配給制度三大原則。在這物資不充裕的時候，更應特別重視現行配給上的第三種缺點——配給品支配的不合理，我們所主張實施合理的重點配給主義。即對眞正需要者及應該維持其需要者，增加其應有的配給量，使其足够需用。</p>
<p>第一種對象是確屬從事增强戰時生產的事業，如軍需工廠必須配與其應需要的食糧。</p>
<p>第二種對象是特別爲國家社會服務的如軍警，重要產業工人，敎師及公務員等，應增加他們的配量。</p>
<p>第三種對象是衣食不周的赤貧階級，如家庭負擔特重，家境特別窮困的薪水階級，應准其訴述實情，申請額外配給。</p>
<p>第四稱對象是無法生活的難民孤兒，應和慈善機關合作，給與救濟性的配給品。</p>
<p>我們總覺得合理的重點主義才是眞正的公平。於一般人是杯水車薪，於富有者是有上加有的普遍的戶口配給，如果無法維持，我們主張不妨採用合理的重點配給。不過，重點配給的如何支配，才爲合理，當然不如普遍配給的易於着子，允須研究實施方案。本報率先公開徵求各界人士意見（啓事載今日本報第三版），以期集思廣益，貢獻當局。願有關當局注意及之。</p>

<p>戰局態形熾形，目下正於菲賓展開大決戰中，戰果亦與日俱增，逐漸擴大中。今日之戰况，已不能分別前綫後方，一億國民爲感謝神風特別攻擊隊之功勳，應一致奮起，猛烈戰鬥，確保戰力，且此不僅爲日本國民之責任，大東亞各民族以完成大東亞戰爭爲目標，預防敵人進攻，自不待言。且應各就本位邁進，增强戰力，爲安定東亞，非從日軍之後奮起作戰不可。今日之興亞運動，不僅爲國民運動，大東亞戰爭者，亦即此因時間與空間不同，更須繼以經濟工作，或協力戰爭，故今日之興亞遝動階段，必須自覺爲大東亞戰爭行爲中之一環，故望强力之運動，即迅於大東亞全城展開此確保東亞之安定，進一步貢獻於世界和平。資此亦即日本不動之方針，因之確保東亞安定，必須爲興亞之運動，其基本精神，大東亞共同宣言已明示，係基於道義，以求共存共榮秩序之實現，進而貢獻世界，故於此大理想之下，天二東亞各民族之協力提携，愈形緊密，更須強固全大東亞十億民族，欣然與日軍協力，立於火東亞前綫之決意，日政府基於大政翼贊會興亞總本之部一切方針，不惜對雄大之興亞運動，予以協力，以完成其活動。</p>

<h3>衛生署努力進行　各地戒烟事宜　際會署長談過去情形</h3>
<p>南京四日中央社電　全國禁烟事宜已由最高國防會議議決，自三十四年度起，改歸軍事委員會主管。記者爲欲明瞭過去戒烟成績，於昨趨就衛生署陸署長，承答談如茨：「本署對於禁烟事宜，自受內政部梅部長委托辦理，即積極籌設戒烟醫院。一面趕製麻醉藥品，因庫款支絀，於京滬兩巿先設直轄戒烟兩醫院、其他各省縣（先從蘇浙皖三省　辦）就原有公私立醫院，計分甲，乙·丙三級，一甲級須有五十架之戒烟設備，乙級須有三十架戒烟病床，丙級須有二十架，由本署派員確查後，方指定醫院兼理戒烟事宜，一面撥款補助。期有小縣而原無醫院者，則以一縣收容二縣或三縣之烟民，此實因地制宜，不得已之辦法。計今纔四閱月，各省經本署指定已辦之醫院，已有十餘處。至京滬兩市戒烟醫院，除籌備期間不計外，正式收容烟民，已不下數百人。滬市據報亦有數百人左右，進行似頗順利。傳戒烟民京巿亦於本月開始，爲數頗衆，其戒烟主要藥品鴉片酊，則委託滬巿大藥廠製就，分給各醫院及各藥房各醫師爲戒烟之用，惟原料尚覺洪求不能相應，正常有應接不暇之勢。從目前情况觀察，烟民戒絕當可達到預期之數目，本署亦惟有不斷努力，推行政府之施策，使烟民無一向隅而後已。關於戒烟技術問題，本署現正請設戒烟專門路詢委員會，聘請戒烟專家研究，此亦推進戒烟之一種良好辦法。</p>

<p>鮑斯主席談話全文</p>
<p>印度自由臨時政府主席鮑斯氏於本月一日抵滬，二日接見記者團發表談話，全文如次：</p>
<p>戰局已逹轉捩點</p>
<p>余離滬已一載，此次重遊舊地，不勝欣幸，一年來一般戰局，及印度之獨立運動，己有許多變動，關於一般戰局，余以爲吾人已到達戰爭之轉捩點，即反軸心之順利反攻，將吿終了，主動行將轉入吾人友邦之手。觀乎太平洋方面台灣及菲律賓之戰，及歡洲德軍之有力抗戰，即可顯見。此項轉變，余因深知美國對於台灣及菲律賓兩役之說法如何，余亦知在若干中立國中，對於美國之說法，給與較廣之宣傳，及較大之信賴。但余敢預言全球不久即將得知美國之說法，並不正確。觀乎英國海軍評論家溫士德勳爵最近之評論即可知英國方已發生懷疑。至於歐洲之局勢，則觀於艾森霍華與史汀生最近之宣吿，邱吉爾在英下院之最近演詞，及敵方之　决延展歐戰終了期，即可得知英美方面之眞正感覺爲如何。印度方面對於歐洲之局勢，非常鎭靜，英美業已開始明瞭其任務之困難，德軍之有力抗戰，實出意料之外，已將英美人力及物力消耗至無可恢復及補充，且吾人相信即使德軍之抵抗卒吿崩潰，亦必有新局面突然展開，致使英美與蘇聯發生嚴重之衝突，此項衝突發生後，英美軍將受牽制於歐洲，而英國亦不能以其艦隊之大部份抽調至太平洋及東亞作戰，結果羅斯福與邱吉勻之歐洲第一政策，將爲英美失敗之重要原因</p>
<p>凖德作長時期苦門</p>
<p>印度在東亞之計劃，目去年以來，即總動員人力及財力，務求以印人之勞力及犧牲爲朮獨立之奮門，印度同胞對此之響應，已超出余之意外，但余現要求彼等作最高之犧牲。著人在印度國外之努力，與在國內之活動，有聯帶關係，吾人以種種方法，不顧重大困難，使國外與國內之活動，相互聯絡，英人將無法加以妨碍。吾人之最後成功，實有賴於印度民衆及英印軍之積極協助，吾人若突破印緬邊境之敵軍陣綫，而進入孟加拉及阿薩姆，則國內之印人，將起而援助吾人，印度國民軍之特別任務，爲使國內之印人相信吾人有力，是以推翻英人之統治能如决，則印度國內將發生革命，而印人及英印軍將大量前來參加吾人，國內印人必須見印度國民軍進入孟加拉及阿薩姆，始能相信可以推翻英人之枷鎖，英人亦深知此是以在緬印邊境作殊死抵抗印度戰爭之決定性戰役，將不如以前之在新德里附近展開，而在阻閉吉大港及伊姆法爾之山嶺叢林地帶發生。換言之，即印緬邊界乃英國在印之馬奇諾防綫，吾人在未突破馬奇諾綫之前，準備作長時期之苦鬥。</p>
<p>印度國民軍係於「九四四年二月四日在緬甸之阿刺干地區開始作戰，此後即沿廣闊之前綫在數處地區作戰，在日軍與印國民軍採取攻勢時，敵軍無法在任何地区獲寸步之進展，雨季降臨後，吾大因戰略關係，不得不在伊姆法爾及阿薩姆前綫稍積後退，其後敵軍即獲前進，而敵方宣傳即謂已獲犬勝，但吾人身在前綫，固知此勝利之眞情如何，最近之作戰經騐，使吾大對於吾人之實力，及最後之勝利，增加百倍之信心，敵人之數量軍器及供應，雖較優越，但吾人能在多處地區，擊敗敵人，侄確信在下次再能擊敗之。現時吾人雖目伊姆法爾及阿薩姆撤退，但在其他地區吾人仍堅守陣地，且在數處已進至印度邊境，準備隨時前進。吾人之最近任務，爲準備下次攻勞，吾人現方利用最近之作戰經騐、積極凖備。余最近訪日時曾與日當局商討關於將來合作之各項問題，已獲得完全一致。途所最敢煩惱之問題，爲重慶政府之態度，因英美與渝方同盟之關係，渝軍援助吾人之敵，維持其在印之統治及恢復其對緬甸之統治，因此渝方之現政策，實有妨於印度之獨立及亞洲。余曾向蔣介石呼籲，請以政治家及亞洲一份子之資格，改變此項政策，否則吾人解放阿薩姆及孟加拉之後，英美在印之對渝供應基地，將被毀滅，而英美在開羅會議中所允給與渝方之援助，將毫無價值，蔣氏若相信英美不能獲得勝利，則不得不改變其現政策，而與其他亞洲各國合作矣。</p>
<p>答記者團重要問題</p>
<p>印度自由政府主席鮑斯於二日在滬接見記者團時，答復各記者所提出之間題如下：（一）鮑斯主席此次來華有何任務？將逗留若干時日？（答）此次來滬爲視察印僑及自由印度國民軍最近情况如何，至於逗留時日，視工作情形而定。（二）甘地鑫近况如何？（答）甘地翁最近釋放後，極希望舉英國政府簽訂條約，英國政府絕無誠意，事實上已失敗，至於國民大會派亦希望與英國妥協，亦無成果，至於印度國內最近政治狀况，可分三點：（一）印度度反英激烈，（二）印度與英國絕無妥協可能，（三）印度知識份子及年長者，均感英國壓迫，故一無好感，所以其他人民，亦同樣非常痛恨英國。（三）此次重臨日本有何感想？（答）此次到日本有兩點感想，（一）全國總動員情形極爲良好，（二）日本人民必勝信念非常堅決。（四）重慶政府最近改組飽斯主席有何感想？（答）軍慶政府自經改組，斯蒂威爾返美後，態度已部份的傾向於美國。但蔣介石將軍究能做至何種地步，美國正在期待中。美國最近希望者厥爲重慶與延安間之妥協，重慶與延安間雖然同爲少數人獨裁政權，但他們最大的分別，爲經濟政策根本不同，所以重慶與延安間的妥協乃不可能的，除非某某一方面願犧牲並放棄其政策，否則其合作之前途，必甚因難。（五）在主席談話中，假使德國在歐戰中失敗後，英美與蘇聯必然發生新的衝突，請舉例證明之。（答）從（一）波關問題，（二）巴爾干問題，（三）亞歐問題，（四）伊閘問題中，可以看出英美與蘇聯間意見皆不一致，倘德國失敗，其意見當更趨分裂，欲來妥協，實不可能。（六）中國政府與印度政府外交關係如何？（答）中國南京政府已經正式承認自由印度臨時政府，至於兩國間外交關係，當視中國南京政府之意見，如何決定。</p>
<p>圭田公使迎鮑斯詞</p>
<p>印度自由臨時政府主席鮑斯，於本月二日晚應本市市政府及日方關係機關之歡迎宴會，席間日大使館土田公使（由坂田參事官代表）致詞如下：</p>
<p>「本日歡迎自由印度臨時政府領袖鮑斯閣下，得有表示歡迎微意之機會，本使引爲無上光勞，鮑斯閣下，現在正率自由印度軍勁旅爲示印度四億同胞解放與達到印度完全自由獨立，而日以繼夜不斷苦鬥，在座諸位當亦熟知。閣下最初踏上抗英戰綫之前鋒時，在一九一九年，因英國暴舉而惹起阿摩圖大屠殺之一年，邇來二十五年，始終以如鐵之意志，與如火之鬥志，永遠抗爭英國之不正當支配印度，其祟高之精神與勇敢之實踐，本使深表祟敬。大東亞戰爭是因爲帝國受英美强硬壓迫不得已爲維護國體求自存自衛而崛起，此毋容暨言。帝國謀淸掃英美侵略亞洲勢力，解放東亞，雷獻於世界和平之傳統世界政策，獲得中國國民政府以及東亞各國民族之共鳴，已進而爲大東亞十億民族團結一致之亞細亞解放戰。當時脫出暴英之　留居德國之鮑斯閣下，立即在東亞出現其英姿，與帝國曁各友國携手、共同站於擊滅英美之聯合作戰、此爲吾最渴望者，然時機尚未成熟，不能達到預期目的，蓋如此大事業，非一朝一夕所能成功者，但世界正義的表顯，不日當可實現，此固無疑義者。日軍在台灣菲島海面，又雷伊泰島以及大陸戰綫所獲之戰績，更能奠定勝利之基礎，此番鮑斯閣下訪問東京，就增加與帝國政府間合作關係，曾加以懇談，結果決定由帝國遺特派公使樹立正式外交關係，本使認爲此舉是表示兩國努力戰爭，將更加强化與活潑。今日歡迎率居住東亞三百萬印度人，參加共同戰綫之鮑斯閣下，本使衷心表示歡迎之忱，舉杯祝閣下奮鬥到底。」</p>
<h3>印團體聯合會　斥英帝國主義</h3>
<p>瑞典京威四日中央社電海通社訊，英國通訊社息，英國印度團體聯合會第二次大會通過決議案，略稱，一九四二年後，印度之鬥爭暫時停頓，但印度民衆推翻英帝國主義之決心愈益堅決，雖受壓迫與飢饉之磨折，而民氣依然激昂，目前印度之經濟困難與壓迫制度，應由英帝國主義者負責，吾人要求公平之調查，對於暴行負責人員加以態戒，印人於國民議會領導之下，作反英運動，故此次大會再次證明印人奮鬥之決心，印人之自由乃世界和平之先決條件。</p>
<h3>東線戰事重心　移洪國南部　德重兵集普拉登湖附</h3>
<p>洪牙利某地四日中央社電海通社訊：蘇軍於洪牙利南部特拉夫河口以北，自莫哈克突入，來勢汹湧，已抵那吉巴雄之西北一帶，然在過去二十四小時之戰國中，局勢已趨穩定，蘇軍此次突破，是否能有戰略上之重要性，當可於日內見之。蘇軍前鋒首先於普拉登湖之西南及東北，與德裝甲部隊相遭遇。蘇將托布興元帥在前綫向記者　發表談話，謂蘇眾之行動，不致成爲閃電戰，蓋渠深知普拉登湖附近集有德方重兵故也。</p>
<p>洪都東北放棄三城</p>
<p>今戰事重心雖移至洪牙利南部，惟洪國東北部戰事仍猛烈如故。德洪軍雖放棄琪恩基奧，埃勞·及米斯科爾茲，然在戰略上並無多大影響，德軍今後當利用馬特拉及布埃克山之斜坡而发挥防禦力量。總之，蘇軍包團洪京之計劃，現猶未能决定其</p>
<p>侵歐军队喪折重大</p>
<p>倫台特上将司令部四日中央社電　海通社訊：艾森霍華之部隊，在亞琛與克恩間損失坦克軍八千輛，人員損失當在四萬至五萬人之間，而反軸心軍之步兵與傘兵之精銳，亦換失過半矣。反軸心軍侵歐第一月總計兵力三十師，第二月增爲五十五師，目前爲八十師，而特別部隊三四十師尚未計入，且反軸心軍銳氣漸挫，而德軍士氣益振云。</p>
<h3>重慶局勢　不利於英美</h3>
<p>斯德哥爾寧四日中央社電德國新聞社訊，據重慶消息，駐渝美電總司令韋特米爾少將宣稱，重慶之局勢對於英美極爲不利。渠續稱，日軍不但配備優良，而且軍事之訓練亦佳，由於撤退之結果，美軍不損失重要空軍根善地一處云。</p>

<h3>大東亞戰三週年　戰利品展覽　明日起在陸军宿舍</h3>
<p>大東亞戰爭發生以還，　已三載，盟軍愈戰愈勇，敵兵潰敗，已至不可收拾之境，值此三周年紀念，意義極爲深長，本市各團體分別排定慶祝行事。茲悉東亞交通公社與上海新聞聯合會，在上海陸軍部報道部贊助之下，定明（六）日起至十五日止，假靜安寺路一五〇號陸軍宿舍（國際飯店隔壁）舉行「大東亞戰爭三周年紀念戰利品與攝影展」，將前綫鹵獲之敵方武器及實地所攝名貴照片，公開陳列，每日上午十時至下午五時，任人參觀，槪不取費市敎育局爲紀念大東亞戰</p>

<h3>赴日考察防空　平山等反滬</h3>
<p>本巿民防空本部，以盟邦日本對於現代防空設施，鞏固堅强，特派總務科長平山一郎，警防處防空指導主任小林久治，消防處副處長淵春明之氏，於十月初赴日考察，歷經東京，大阪，及滿洲國，華北各地，於昨返滬。據平山氏談，略謂此次赴日考察時，敵機於十一月一日來壞東京，此次空襲乃自三十一年四月十八日空製後第一次，當時東京巿民以久經訓練，異常鎭靜，市郊雖有數處被炸，但實際日方所受損失極微，而陸上防空部隊，因準備有待，故敵機始終無法施行襲擊。本人當時在高樓上觀望，雖見敵機投彈，但以東京巿區遼闊，並未聞有爆炸聲。查此次來制敵機，計七十架，第二次十一月三十日晚，復有敵機二十架來襲，因在高空雲中，盲目投彈，本人爲抵日後首次避在防空壕中，感覺毫無危險，甚至若無其事，由此連想上海巿區，應有類似東京之防空設施。日東京市民對於空襲訓練，早經熟練，故不但鎭靜，而且萬分安全。故敵機肓目投彈，不但不能刺激民心，甚而激動萬分，憎惡敵美舉行。又據小林主任談謂，在日時間，敵機來襲東京，本一人以爲損失重大，但經調查所受損失，不及預料料二十分之一，足見敵機炸彈，全係盲目，根本無足影響，徒耗彈藥而已。可見東京巿民對於防空訓練有案，而陸上防空部隊，準備鞏固，故對敵機來襲，應，有方，決不使敵美施展技倆，上海巿民殊有效法之必要。</p>
<h3>奸商煽動物價市民勿相驚擾</h3>
<p>本巿物價，近月來漲風愈厲，經濟當局雖在嚴厲澈查中，但投機市佾囤積居奇，仍在潛伏活動。中央社記者訪經濟當局探詢，上月中（十一月）物價漲風以米，食油，柴炭煤料，及其他日用品如火柴，洋燭，肥皂，捲烟，曁棉織品爲最鉅，雖因空襲關係，人心稍受恐慌，但　結在於非法商民，利用時機及人民心理作用，而故放流言，煽動不安狀態，囤積居奇，高抬巿價，一般無知人民，竟受其惑，紛紛購最主要日用品，持貨者且堅不脫售，以致物價無法抑制，此種情形，富局無日不在注意查緯，以安民心。綜觀上月中物價平均漲起百分之六十至百分之一百。當局抑止物價措權，固在繼續不　澈查取締，惟望巿民勿自相　擾，爭購物資，則漲風自然漸平。</p>

<h3>申報不回籃球昨晚決賽　中北勝華聯　兩隊將定期再決</h3>
<p>申報盃籃球聯賽甲組決賽，昨晚展開空前盛况，觀衆滿坑滿谷，中北以極佳美表演，擊敗常勝軍華聯，洵爲得意之作，結果三十八比二十七，上半時十七比八分。中北昨晚以李震中爲中心，指揮若定，沈聿恭之襲决擲籃，有神來之筆，愈打愈盛，一路領先，每差十分左右，雖最後李震中　出，無足輕重矣。反觀華聯則表演較平時大爲遜色，慌張混亂，遂無法攻破中北之堅壁淸野之防守，在監視方而，又不能阻止李沈等之進攻，卻利亦一籌莫展，上半時失分過多，追亦不及，戰略錯誤，挽回無方。兩隊現各爲八勝一負，委員會將集會商重決日期及辦法。昨晚乙組賽，振源勝玲瓏，二十八比八，上半時十二比四分。同益益聯風，二十六比十五，上半時十四比五分。</p>

<h3>業大餅之者之苦悶</h3>
<p>— 許文耀</p>
<p>在食不易的今日上海，大餅油條實爲貧民之主要食糧，但目下大餅店因原料麺粉蒐購的困難，價格的高昻，資本的短絀而將補迫停業</p>
<p>本來大餅油條是一種卑不足道的食品，從未登過大雅之堂，幸而偶然被中產階級用爲點膳，也不過換換口味而已。一白米價飛漲不已之後，磊餅油條才普徧被食用於各階層起來，因之大餅油條的售價始爲當局所注意，過去如前工部局的限價部派員不時到各大餅店去抽查售價和大餅的重量。</p>
<p>本年九月間大餅油條售價從每件五元激漲到每件十元，一時輿論譁然，以其影響貧民生活焉，雖經市經濟局及市餅饅油燴號業同業公會勸告抑止，但終因原料昻貴，並無配給麺粉而仍上漲爲每件十元。旋經市物價評委員會公定爲每件十元。旋經市物價評議委員會公定爲每件八元，惟以單票奇缺而未能實行。最近麺粉已出六千元關，其餘原料亦昇漲不已，似有再度漲價之可能，而未漲者，其故爲格於功令，或稍有存貨，足以暫維營業者。前次漲價後營業額已受折扣影響，兼之業餅饅者無詳細會計以資稽核，祇有得過且過，將資本食完蝕完而停業。</p>
<p>現時業大餅者最痛苦處，爲不能獲得特種配給物品以資調劑，而出品售價則須受限價束縛，有時因蒐購原料麺粉而觸及法綱，喪失其物資。如最近上海區粉麩統配處在車站等處查緝黑市麺粉，每有大餅店主向黑市販者收售之麺粉，亦遭池魚之殃者，已不在少數。筆者服務該業公會故見聞較詳，大餅油條之原料及成本亦略有研究，爰將其成本及需用原料列表於後：</p>
<p>成本之計算方式：（各項原料加利和加麺粉）乘袋數加費用加煤除袋數除斤數，等於每斤成本。</p>
<p>大餅應用原料：麺粉（現價六千五百左右一袋）芝蔴二斤（每斤一百五十元左右）碱二斤（每斤三百五十元左右）鹽一斤（八十元），煤二十斤，（係垃圾煤約四十元一斤），飴糖一斤（二百三十元），可製餅五十五斤。</p>
<p>油條應用原料：麺粉一袋，碱三斤，油二十斤（約六千元），　二斤（每斤約六千元），鹽二斤，煤三十斤，約可製油條六十斤。</p>
<p>以上表觀之，則單以麺粉一包製成大餅，以十元之售價，須製成九百個大餅，才够所用原料之成本，其一切開繳尙不在內，若以上表之成本及現時之營業不振狀况對比，則大餅店將逐漸不支而收歇，將爲時間問題；而大餅油條亦將有絕跡之日焉。此有關貧民貪糧之大餅油條，當局亦思有以救濟之乎？</p>

<h3>Heavy Rain and Wind on Leyte Island; Japanese Army Makes Daring Surprise Attack; Enemy Airfields at Burauen and Others Fall into Chaos</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from the Philippines, 4th: Unprecedented heavy rain and wind have struck Leyte Island for months, unseen even in New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. This adverse weather is like divine assistance for the Japanese soldiers and officers. The Japanese army's suicidal assault troops are taking advantage of these storms to launch rapid attacks on the enemy. The storms and darkness are like weapons bestowed by heaven, inflicting great damage on the enemy. Combined with the surprise attacks by the Japanese assault troops, the enemy is in utter chaos. Enemy positions and supply depots in the northern part of Leyte Island have been repeatedly subjected to destruction or fires by Japanese warriors, despite the enemy's attempts to strengthen defenses. The great mission of disrupting enemy transportation routes on Leyte Island is the duty of Japanese warriors. Therefore, the Japanese assault troops are causing significant obstacles to the American operations on Leyte Island. Soldiers and officers on the front lines consider Leyte Island to be the grave of American Pacific invasion operations and are repeatedly engaging in heroic battles.</p>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from the Philippines Base, 4th: After Japanese paratroopers landed aggressively near the enemy airfields at Burauen and Tacloban and launched surprise attacks, the enemy positions have fallen into a state of chaos. Furthermore, due to the nightly ambushes and surprise attacks by Japanese warriors, the enemy's terror has reached its peak. According to a report from a Japanese reconnaissance plane on the 2nd, many aircraft previously on the ground at the Burauen and Tacloban airfields are now nowhere to be seen. This also shows the extent of the enemy's fear of the Japanese warriors' surprise attacks.</p>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Philippines Base, 4th: The Japanese naval air force in the waters west of Leyte Island, near the Camotes Sea, sank one enemy destroyer, seven torpedo boats, and one transport ship, and destroyed four torpedo boats in the two days starting November 30th. This was announced by the Imperial Headquarters on the 3rd. The Japanese air units continued to pursue the retreating enemy ships from the evening of the 2nd to the morning of the 3rd, sinking another destroyer and damaging one. They continued to attack at low altitude with machine guns, causing the enemy ships to be destroyed and flee in defeat.</p>
<h3>Meritorious Kamikaze Pilots Promoted Two Ranks; Announcement by the Japanese Navy Ministry</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Tokyo, 4th: The Japanese Navy Ministry announced on the 3rd that meritorious members of the Kamikaze Special Attack Corps would be promoted. Lieutenant Junior Grade Yoshitoyo Kuna was promoted to Lieutenant Commander. Petty Officer First Class Norio Taniya, Sōbun Kasasa, Iwao Nakano, Tadashi Miyakawa, Tomisaku Katsumata, Minoru Shiota, Sadakatsu Yamazawa, Yukihiro Hirota, Noriyuki Yamashita, Kiyoshi Sakita, and Petty Officer Second Class Toraō Otani, Seizō Miura, all promoted to Ensign. Airman Chief Naotoshi Nagamine, Airman First Class Shigeo Ōguro, Airman Chief Shigeo Katsura, Shoichi Suzuki, Fumio Sakuramori, and Haruo Ōshita were promoted to Airman Petty Officer.</p>
<h3>Marshal Hata Arrives in Tokyo by Plane</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Tokyo, 4th: The newly appointed Director-General of Education, Marshal Shunroku Hata, arrived in Tokyo at 5:00 AM on the 4th by plane and stayed at the Yushukukan Kaikōsha.</p>
<h3>Donation to Comfort Civilians Affected by American Air Raids in Hankou</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Hankou, 4th: Allied American aircraft stationed in Chongqing have blindly dropped bombs on densely populated commercial areas of Hankou, causing unprecedented devastation and inhumane suffering to innocent civilians. Marshal Shunroku Hata, deeply concerned about the victims, has donated one million national currency as relief funds. The funds were received by Governor Yang, who expressed gratitude on behalf of all the affected people. He has also instructed his subordinates to promptly carry out relief work so that the victims can receive tangible benefits.</p>
<h3>Intense Battles on the Yunnan-Burma Road</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from a Frontline Base in Burma, 4th: The elite Japanese forces continuing to engage in fierce battles around Mangshi are fiercely repelling the stubborn counterattacks of the Yunnan Expeditionary Force from Chongqing. On the 17th, they dealt a heavy blow to a key point on the Yunnan-Burma Road, driving out the Chongqing troops who were building forward positions there and seizing it. As a result, the Chongqing army's ambition to forcibly advance, relying on the natural defenses of the area, was completely shattered. The fighting along the Yunnan-Burma Road in early January was extremely fierce. According to reports, from the beginning of the Chongqing army's general counteroffensive on November 1st to the 14th, the number of bodies left behind reached 1,711, indicating the intensity of the battles. Japanese forces in northern Burma are also disrupting the main force of the British Indian 36th Division with unconventional surprise attacks, causing them to retreat. The British Indian 25th and 26th Brigades and the West African 82nd Division, which are attempting to retake Akyab, have been annihilated by the Japanese army. The Japanese army's unconventional tactics have greatly constrained the enemy positions. However, enemy forces determined to retake Akyab attempted to land with a small force of about one hundred men ten kilometers south of Maungdaw on the 20th and 21st, but were also repelled by the Japanese army.</p>
<h3>Twenty-One Enemy Aircraft Shot Down in Air Raid on Tokyo</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Tokyo, 4th: Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:30 PM on the 4th: (1) The results of the battle on the 3rd, when enemy aircraft raided Tokyo and the surrounding areas, have been determined as follows: Including the Imperial Headquarters' announcement on the 3rd, 21 enemy aircraft were shot down, of which 7 were unconfirmed. The Japanese side had 6 self-destructing aircraft that did not return (including those involved in ramming). (2) Among those who participated in ramming during this battle, the following have been identified: Lieutenant Junior Grade Toru Shinomoya (survived), Sergeant Masami Okimoto, and Corporal Masao Itagaki (survived).</p>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Tokyo, 4th: Enemy B-29 aircraft from the Mariana Islands raided Tokyo again from 2:00 PM to 3:30 PM on the 3rd, for an hour and a half. About seventy aircraft, divided into ten groups, blindly dropped bombs and incendiary bombs from altitudes of seven thousand to ten thousand meters, mostly bombing the suburbs. The Japanese air defense forces engaged the enemy aircraft over Tokyo, engaging in a fierce aerial battle. At the same time, they fired accurately with anti-aircraft artillery, shooting down 15 enemy aircraft. After detailed investigation, there may be more. The damage to the Japanese side from this enemy raid was minimal. Fires broke out only in the raided areas and were extinguished with the cooperation of officers, soldiers, and civilians. The enemy aircraft have now raided Tokyo, bombing key Japanese points, four times, totaling two hundred aircraft. The Japanese army shot down 14 of them in the first raid and 15 in this raid, totaling 29, accounting for 1/1.5 of the total. In particular, the power of the Japanese interception and anti-aircraft fire was even greater than in the previous two raids. They shot down as many as 15 aircraft in aerial combat in extremely strong winds aloft, giving the citizens a great sense of trust. This shows that the Japanese interception posture, with the cooperation of officers, soldiers, and civilians, is becoming more and more complete.</p>
<p>American Military Officer Admits Difficulty in Air Raids on Japan</p>
<p>Central News Agency Report from Chongqing: Since losing the southwest base group, which provided the shortest protected distance for air control over the Japanese mainland, the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing has been actively increasing the number of B-29 Superfortress aircraft. There are now about 150 to 160 B-29 aircraft in Chengdu, and about 400 to 600 B-24, B-25, P-51, and P-40 aircraft deployed at other bases. Only B-29 aircraft have recently been used to raid the Japanese mainland and Manchuria. The commander of the U.S. Pacific Air Command, who was responsible for the recent air raid on Tokyo, stated that Japan possesses anti-aircraft guns capable of reaching the same altitude as the B-29 aircraft. Therefore, U.S. aircraft are often subjected to intense anti-aircraft fire over Tokyo, expressing the difficulty of achieving air control over the Japanese mainland.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Prioritizing Rice Rationing</h3>
<p>During wartime, due to the reduction of material resources, in order to avoid abuse and waste and to ensure that valuable materials are used for legitimate needs, a material rationing system is implemented. Some places in our country have been implementing rationing of important materials for quite some time, especially in Shanghai, where the municipal government has a dedicated Material Rationing Office, which can be said to be of considerable scale.</p>
<p>Currently, material resources are becoming increasingly scarce, and people's livelihoods are becoming more difficult. Reasonable and appropriate material rationing is becoming increasingly important. However, a review of all past rationing measures reveals that there are many areas that need to be corrected. Here, we offer some suggestions for reforming the rice rationing system for the reference of the Chinese and Japanese authorities.</p>
<p>The current rice rationing system is most likely to make people feel that it is not entirely reasonable. In addition to the insufficient quantity and the failure to be accurate in terms of timing, the allocation is also unreasonable. Precisely because the quantity is insufficient and the timing is inaccurate, the allocation needs to be particularly reasonable in order to compensate. If rice rationing reaches the point of being timely and sufficient, meeting the needs of everyone, then there will be no question of reasonable or unreasonable allocation. In other words, before the rationing system reaches the point of being sufficient, the allocation cannot take an absolutely universal approach. There should be reasonable distinctions, adopting a principle of prioritization. For example, wealthy classes basically do not need rationed rice. Even if it is rationed to them, they dislike its coarseness and only use it to feed their dogs, cats, chickens, and ducks. As for coarse grain rations such as buckwheat flour and black flour, they are even regarded as dregs and discarded, at most used as food for servants. On the other hand, the poor need it desperately, hoping for rations like clouds and rain, cherishing both coarse rice and coarse grains as if they were life itself. Under these circumstances, reasonable allocation is naturally necessary.</p>
<p>The current rationing system, in addition to universal household registration rationing, also has special rations. The purpose of special rations is to subsidize certain personnel who work hard and live frugally, such as public education personnel. The establishment of this system already indicates that the universal rationing system is not entirely reasonable. Therefore, further reasonable adjustments to the current rationing system, adopting a principle of prioritization, is something that needs to be considered as soon as possible. We believe that reasonable allocation can alleviate the severe threat posed by the rice problem to poor citizens, and it may not be a major way to stabilize society.</p>
<p>Sufficient quantity, timely delivery, and reasonable allocation should be the three major principles of a rationing system. In times of scarcity of materials, even greater emphasis should be placed on the third shortcoming of current rationing – the unreasonable allocation of rationed goods. We advocate the implementation of a reasonable principle of prioritized rationing, that is, increasing the amount of rations to those who truly need them and those who should have their needs maintained, so that they have enough to meet their needs.</p>
<p>The first target group is those who are indeed engaged in activities that enhance wartime production, such as military factories, which must be allocated the food they need.</p>
<p>The second target group is those who are specially serving the country and society, such as military police, key industrial workers, teachers, and civil servants, whose rations should be increased.</p>
<p>The third target group is the extremely poor who lack adequate food and clothing, such as salaried workers with particularly heavy family burdens and particularly poor circumstances. They should be allowed to state their actual situation and apply for additional rations.</p>
<p>The fourth target group is refugees and orphans who are unable to live, who should be given relief rations in cooperation with charitable organizations.</p>
<p>We always feel that a reasonable principle of prioritization is true fairness. A universal household registration rationing system, which is a drop in the bucket for the general public and more than enough for the wealthy, cannot be sustained. We advocate the adoption of a reasonable principle of prioritized rationing. However, how to allocate prioritized rations reasonably is certainly not as easy to implement as universal rationing, and a detailed implementation plan must be studied. This newspaper takes the lead in publicly soliciting opinions from all sectors of society (announcement on page 3 of today's newspaper) in order to gather collective wisdom and contribute to the authorities. We hope that the relevant authorities will pay attention to this.</p>
<h3>Asia Cooperation Conference Solemnly Held Yesterday</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Tokyo, 4th: The first Asia Cooperation Conference after the reorganization of the Asia General Headquarters of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association was solemnly held at the Imperial Hotel here on the morning of the 4th, starting at 11:30 AM. President of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association Koiso, Greater East Asia Minister Shigemitsu, Director-General of the Asia General Headquarters Matsui, Director-General Takagi, Chairman of the Cooperation Conference Ichijo, and eighty members all attended. President Koiso delivered the opening address, and then the conference entered the agenda. After the Headquarters reported on the key points of launching the Asia movement, they held frank discussions on the specific movement direction aimed at strengthening the cooperative posture of the various ethnic groups in Greater East Asia, and the conference concluded successfully at 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>Key Points of President Koiso's Address</p>
<p>The war situation is intensifying. A major decisive battle is currently unfolding in the Philippines, and the results of the battle are increasing daily and gradually expanding. Today's war situation cannot distinguish between the front and the rear. To thank the Kamikaze Special Attack Corps for their achievements, 100 million citizens should rise up together, fight fiercely, and secure war power. This is not only the responsibility of the Japanese people. Each ethnic group in Greater East Asia must strive to achieve the goals of the Greater East Asia War, prevent enemy attacks, needless to say, and advance in their respective positions, increasing war power. To stabilize East Asia, they must rise up and fight after the Japanese army. Today's Asia movement is not only a national movement. The Greater East Asia War is also because the time and space are different, and it must be followed by economic work or cooperation in the war. Therefore, the current stage of the Asia movement must be consciously made a part of the Greater East Asia War act. Therefore, we hope that a strong movement will quickly unfold throughout Greater East Asia to ensure the stability of East Asia and further contribute to world peace. This is also the unwavering policy of Japan. Therefore, ensuring the stability of East Asia must be the movement of Asia. The basic spirit of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration has made it clear that it is based on morality to achieve the realization of a co-existence and co-prosperity order, and to further contribute to the world. Therefore, under this great ideal, the cooperation and collaboration of the various ethnic groups in East Asia is becoming closer and closer. We must strengthen the determination of the one billion people of Greater East Asia to cooperate with the Japanese army and stand on the front lines of Greater East Asia. The Japanese government, based on all the policies of the Asia General Headquarters of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, will spare no effort to cooperate with the grand Asia movement to complete its activities.</p>

<h3>Japanese Army Occupies Dushan; Guizhou Situation Critical; Guizhou Provincial Government Evacuates Civil Servants</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from the Guangxi Front Line, 4th: After breaking through the Liming Pass on the border between Guizhou and Guangxi provinces, Japanese rapid units, along with friendly forces from Nandan, launched fierce attacks on the main strongholds of the 27th Army Group of Chongqing. The advance units of the Japanese army occupied Dushan, a key point on the Guizhou-Guangxi Highway, at 12:38 PM on the 2nd. Another unit occupied Sanhe, reaching about 70 kilometers northeast of Dushan. The provincial capital of Guiyang is in imminent danger.</p>

Our side suffered no losses.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Supplies Management Chiefs Hold Fourth Conference</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Tokyo, 4th: The fourth Japanese Military Supplies Management Chiefs' Conference was held on the afternoon of the 3rd at the Prime Minister's official residence. During the meeting, Japanese Prime Minister Koiso instructed that in order to win the battle in the Philippines, every effort must be made to enhance existing material combat power. Furthermore, in order to prepare for the next phase of operations, which will continue to require supplies, all material resources must be thoroughly utilized. While the actual situation of current material combat power does not allow us to be optimistic, if we can use careful dedication and implement outstanding plans to concentrate the country's total material power, divine results can certainly be achieved. We must promote this long-term production and supply battle, so that our subordinates truly grasp the essence of production administration and operation, so that the intentions of the superiors can permeate to the end of the Japanese operation.</p>

<h3>Fierce Battle for Hagenau; Bloody Battle for Six Days and Nights; French Forces Northeast of Mulhouse Surrounded</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from the Western Front, 4th: Datong News Agency reports: The U.S. Army's 79th Infantry Division has been attacking Hagenau for six days and nights without success. The U.S. Army has suffered heavy losses and now regards the forest south of Hagenau as a "bloody forest." The forest is shrouded in smoke, and the artillery units of the German and U.S. armies are constantly exchanging fire. Central News Agency Dispatch from Berlin, 4th</p>
<p>Datong News Agency reports: Five battalions of colonial troops from the French First Army were trapped northeast of Mulhouse on the 1st. Therefore, the vanguard of the French First Army is no longer able to do anything. These five battalions of French troops crossed the Huninggen Canal last week and advanced north to the Mulhouse-Neuburg railway, where they were confronted by German troops. On the 3rd, German troops counterattacked the flank of the French army east of Napoleon Island, where the Huninggen Canal and the Rhine-Rhone Canal meet. The only bridge on the canal was destroyed by the German army. With their retreat cut off, the French troops are gradually being annihilated.</p>
<h3>Anti-Axis Powers to Hold Foreign Ministers' Conference</h3>
<p>Three-Headed Meeting to be Extended; Central News Agency Dispatch from the Swedish Capital, 4th: German News Agency reports: According to the opinions of political circles in Washington quoted by Swedish newspapers, the Luoqiu Conference will most likely be extended indefinitely because Stalin has again declared that he cannot leave the Soviet Union due to military reasons. The extension of this conference is also influenced by the development of the war situation, which is developing more slowly than the anti-Axis powers had expected. Washington political circles also believe that U.S. Secretary of State Stettinius, British Foreign Secretary Eden, and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov will likely hold a meeting, and the Chongqing side may also have representatives participate.</p>
<h3>U.S. State Department to Thoroughly Reorganize; Emphasis on Post-War Economy</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from the Swedish Capital, 4th: German News Agency reports: News from New York: The newly appointed U.S. Secretary of State Stettinius is currently busy reorganizing the State Department. This is the first major change implemented in years, and there is no doubt that Stettinius intends to quickly and thoroughly complete his task. Washington political observers predict that drastic changes will occur within the State Department because the new Secretary of State and his collaborators attach importance to economic issues. Therefore, many issues that previously did not fall within the scope of the State Department's activities will also be handled by the State Department. Stettinius plans to establish a vast diplomatic system of American economic representatives around the world after the war.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Health Striving to Carry Out Anti-Smoking Matters in Various Places; Minister of Health Recounts Past Circumstances</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Nanjing, 4th: The issue of national smoking prohibition has been resolved by the Supreme National Defense Council and will be transferred to the jurisdiction of the Military Affairs Commission starting in 1934. In order to understand past achievements in smoking cessation, this reporter interviewed Minister of Health Lu yesterday, who replied as follows: "Since the Ministry of Health was entrusted by Minister of Interior Mei to handle smoking prohibition matters, it has been actively planning to establish smoking cessation hospitals. On the one hand, we are rushing to manufacture anesthetic drugs. Due to insufficient funds, we first established two directly administered smoking cessation hospitals in the cities of Beijing and Shanghai. Other provinces and counties (starting with the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui) were assigned to existing public and private hospitals, which were divided into three levels: A, B, and C. Level A required 50 sets of smoking cessation equipment, Level B required 30 smoking cessation beds, and Level C required 20. After our Ministry sent personnel to verify, the hospitals were designated to handle smoking cessation matters and allocated funds to subsidize them. In small counties where there were no hospitals, one county would accommodate smokers from two or three counties. This was truly a measure adapted to local conditions, a last resort. Only four months have passed, and there are already more than ten hospitals in various provinces that have been designated and are operating by our Ministry. As for the smoking cessation hospitals in Beijing and Shanghai, excluding the preparation period, they have formally accommodated no less than several hundred smokers. The Shanghai Municipal Government has also reported several hundred people, and the progress seems to be quite smooth. It is reported that smoking cessation in Beijing will also begin this month, with a large number of people. The main drug for smoking cessation, opium tincture, is entrusted to a large pharmaceutical factory in Shanghai to produce and distribute to various hospitals, pharmacies, and doctors for smoking cessation purposes. However, the raw materials are still not sufficient to meet the demand, and there is a situation where we cannot keep up. From the current situation, it seems that we can achieve the expected number of smokers quitting. Our Ministry will continue to work hard to promote the government's policies so that no smoker is turned away. Regarding technical issues related to smoking cessation, our Ministry is currently requesting the establishment of a specialized smoking cessation advisory committee, inviting smoking cessation experts to conduct research. This is also a good way to promote smoking cessation.</p>

<h3>Chairman Bose of the Provisional Government of Free India Arrives in Shanghai from Japan; Holds Important Talks After Meeting with the Press Corps</h3>
<p>Chairman Bose of the Provisional Government of Free India arrived in Shanghai by plane on the first of this month. On the morning of the 2nd, he went to the Free India National Army training camp on Baoshan Road to give instructions. At 3:00 PM, he met with the local Chinese and foreign press corps at the Cathay Hotel to deliver a speech (recorded separately) and answer questions raised by famous reporters (Q&amp;A recorded separately). That evening, the Municipal Government and Japanese authorities jointly held a welcome banquet, during which Mr. Sakata, Counselor of the Japanese Embassy, delivered a speech on behalf of Minister Tsuchida, who had left Shanghai on official business (text of speech recorded separately). At 10:30 AM on the 11th, Bose attended a welcome rally held by Indian expatriates at the Grand Theater. Previously, 2,000 Indian expatriates in the city gathered in the Bund Park, led by the Municipal Police Bureau band, to proceed to the Grand Theater for the meeting. At the meeting, Liang Xiuyu, Director of the Propaganda Department, delivered a speech first, and it was decided that Chettur, the branch director of the Indian Independence League in Shanghai, would deliver a speech. Then, representatives of the Indian expatriates presented Bose with a sword. Finally, Bose gave a reply. The meeting adjourned at around 1:00 PM. Bose will stay for several days and leave Shanghai as soon as his business is completed.</p>
<p>Full Text of Chairman Bose's Speech</p>
<p>Chairman Bose of the Provisional Government of Free India arrived in Shanghai on the 1st of this month. On the 2nd, he met with the press corps and delivered a speech, the full text of which is as follows:</p>
<p>The War Situation Has Reached a Turning Point</p>
<p>I have been away from Shanghai for a year, and I am very pleased to revisit this old place. In the past year, there have been many changes in the general war situation and India's independence movement. Regarding the general war situation, I believe that we have reached the turning point of the war, that is, the smooth counteroffensive of the anti-Axis powers will come to an end, and the initiative will soon be in the hands of our allies. This can be clearly seen in the battles of Taiwan and the Philippines in the Pacific, and the powerful resistance of the German army in Europe. Regarding this change, I know very well how the United States views the battles of Taiwan and the Philippines. I also know that in some neutral countries, the United States' views are given wider publicity and greater trust. But I dare to predict that the world will soon know that the United States' views are not correct. This can be seen from the recent comments of British naval commentator Lord Winster, which shows that doubts have already arisen in Britain. As for the situation in Europe, the true feelings of the British and American sides can be seen from the recent announcements of Eisenhower and Stimson, Churchill's recent speech in the British House of Commons, and the enemy's (missing character) decision to extend the end of the European war. India is very calm about the situation in Europe. The British and Americans have already begun to understand the difficulty of their mission. The powerful resistance of the German army is unexpected and has exhausted British and American manpower and material resources to the point of no recovery or replenishment. Moreover, we believe that even if the resistance of the German army finally collapses, a new situation will suddenly unfold, leading to a serious conflict between Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union. After this conflict occurs, the British and American forces will be constrained in Europe, and Britain will not be able to withdraw a large part of its fleet to fight in the Pacific and East Asia. As a result, Roosevelt and Churchill's "Europe First" policy will be an important reason for the failure of Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>Prepared for a Long and Arduous Struggle with Germany</p>
<p>India's plan in East Asia, since last year, has been to mobilize manpower and financial resources to strive for independence through the labor and sacrifice of Indians. The response of Indian compatriots to this has exceeded my expectations, but I now ask them to make the highest sacrifices. The efforts of our people abroad are related to the activities within the country. We use various methods, regardless of great difficulties, to link the activities abroad with those at home, and the British will be unable to obstruct them. Our final success depends on the active assistance of the Indian people and the British Indian Army. If we break through the enemy's front line on the Indian-Burmese border and enter Bengal and Assam, the Indians in the country will rise up to help us. The special mission of the Indian National Army is to make the Indians in the country believe that we are powerful, so that the overthrow of British rule can be decided. Then, a revolution will occur in India, and Indians and the British Indian Army will come to join us in large numbers. Indians in the country must see the Indian National Army enter Bengal and Assam before they can believe that the shackles of the British can be overthrown. The British also know this, so the decisive battle of the Indian War on the Burmese-Indian border will be a desperate resistance, not as before in the vicinity of New Delhi, but in the mountainous and jungle areas blocking Chittagong and Imphal. In other words, the Burmese-Indian border is Britain's Maginot Line in India. Before we break through the Maginot Line, we are prepared for a long and arduous struggle.</p>
<p>The Indian National Army began fighting in the Arakan region of Burma on February 4, 1944. Since then, it has fought in several areas along a wide front line. When the Japanese and Indian National Army took the offensive, the enemy was unable to gain an inch of progress in any area. After the rainy season came, we had to retreat slightly from the Imphal and Assam front lines for strategic reasons. After that, the enemy gained progress, and the enemy's propaganda claimed that it had won a great victory. But we, who are on the front line, know the truth of this victory. Recent combat experience has increased our confidence in our strength and final victory a hundredfold. Although the enemy's quantity of weapons and supplies is superior, we have been able to defeat the enemy in many areas, and we are sure that we can defeat them again next time. Although we are currently withdrawing from Imphal and Assam, we are still holding our ground in other areas, and in several places we have advanced to the Indian border, ready to advance at any time. Our most recent task is to prepare for the next attack. We are now actively preparing, using recent combat experience. During my recent visit to Japan, I discussed various issues regarding future cooperation with the Japanese authorities and reached complete agreement. The most worrying issue is the attitude of the Chongqing government. Because of the alliance between Britain, the United States, and Chongqing, the Chongqing army is helping our enemies, maintaining their rule in India, and restoring their rule in Burma. Therefore, Chongqing's current policy hinders India's independence and Asia. I have appealed to Chiang Kai-shek to change this policy in the capacity of a politician and a member of Asia. Otherwise, after we liberate Assam and Bengal, the British and American supply base to Chongqing in India will be destroyed, and the aid that Britain and the United States promised to give to Chongqing at the Cairo Conference will be worthless. If Chiang believes that Britain and the United States cannot win, he will have to change his current policy and cooperate with other Asian countries.</p>
<p>Answers to Important Questions from the Press Corps</p>
<p>Chairman Bose of the Provisional Government of Free India answered the following questions raised by reporters at a meeting with the press corps in Shanghai on the 2nd: (1) What is Chairman Bose's mission in coming to China this time? How long will he stay? (A) This visit to Shanghai is to inspect the recent situation of Indian expatriates and the Free India National Army. As for the length of stay, it depends on the work situation. (2) What is Gandhi's recent situation? (A) After Gandhi was released recently, he hoped to sign a treaty with the British government. The British government has no sincerity at all. In fact, it has failed. As for the National Congress Party, it also hopes to compromise with Britain, but there has been no result. As for the recent political situation in India, it can be divided into three points: (1) India's anti-British sentiment is fierce, (2) There is no possibility of compromise between India and Britain, (3) Indian intellectuals and elders all feel the oppression of Britain, so they have no goodwill. Therefore, other people also hate Britain very much. (3) What are your thoughts on revisiting Japan this time? (A) I have two thoughts on this visit to Japan: (1) The situation of national mobilization is very good, (2) The Japanese people's belief in victory is very firm. (4) What are Chairman Bose's thoughts on the recent reorganization of the Chongqing government? (A) Since the Chongqing government was reorganized and Stilwell returned to the United States, its attitude has partially shifted towards the United States. However, the United States is waiting to see to what extent General Chiang Kai-shek can go. What the United States hopes for recently is a compromise between Chongqing and Yan'an. Although Chongqing and Yan'an are both minority dictatorships, their biggest difference is that their economic policies are fundamentally different. Therefore, a compromise between Chongqing and Yan'an is impossible, unless one side is willing to sacrifice and abandon its policies, otherwise the prospects for their cooperation will be very difficult. (5) In the chairman's speech, it was said that if Germany fails in the European war, new conflicts will inevitably occur between Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union. Please give examples to prove this. (A) It can be seen from (1) the Polish issue, (2) the Balkan issue, (3) the Asian issue, and (4) the Iranian issue that Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union have inconsistent opinions. If Germany fails, their opinions will become more divided, and it will be impossible to compromise. (6) What is the diplomatic relationship between the Chinese government and the Indian government? (A) The Chinese Nanjing government has officially recognized the Provisional Government of Free India. As for the diplomatic relationship between the two countries, it will depend on how the Chinese Nanjing government decides.</p>
<p>Minister Gui Tian's Welcome Speech to Bose</p>
<p>Chairman Bose of the Provisional Government of Free India attended the welcome banquet held by the Municipal Government and Japanese authorities on the evening of the 2nd of this month. During the banquet, Minister Tsuchida of the Japanese Embassy (represented by Counselor Sakata) delivered the following speech:</p>
<p>"Today, I have the opportunity to express my welcome to His Excellency Bose, the leader of the Provisional Government of Free India. I consider it a great honor. His Excellency Bose is now leading the strong troops of the Free Indian Army in a day and night struggle to demonstrate the liberation of 400 million compatriots in India and to achieve India's complete freedom and independence. Everyone here is probably familiar with this. When His Excellency first stepped onto the front line of the anti-British war in 1919, in the year that the British atrocity caused the Amritsar massacre, for the past 25 years, he has always used his iron will and fiery fighting spirit to forever fight against Britain's improper control of India. I deeply respect his lofty spirit and courageous practice. The Greater East Asia War was launched because the Empire was forced to rise up under the strong pressure of Britain and the United States in order to maintain the national polity and seek self-preservation and self-defense. This does not need to be said. The Empire's traditional world policy of seeking to clear away the British and American forces that are invading Asia, liberating East Asia, and contributing to world peace has resonated with the Chinese National Government and the nationalities of various East Asian countries, and has progressed into an Asian liberation war in which one billion nationalities in Greater East Asia are united. At that time, His Excellency Bose, who had escaped from the violent British (missing character) and resided in Germany, immediately appeared in East Asia in his heroic posture, joining hands with the Empire and friendly countries to jointly stand on the United Allied War to destroy Britain and the United States. This is what I most longed for, but the time was not yet ripe and the expected goal could not be achieved. After all, such a great cause cannot be achieved overnight, but the manifestation of world justice will soon be realized, and this is undoubtedly true. The victories achieved by the Japanese army in the seas off Taiwan and the Philippines, as well as on the island of Leyte and on the mainland front, will further lay the foundation for victory. During His Excellency Bose's visit to Tokyo this time, he held earnest talks on increasing cooperation with the Imperial government. As a result, it was decided that the Empire would specially dispatch a minister to establish formal diplomatic relations. I believe that this move indicates that the two countries' efforts in the war will be further strengthened and invigorated. Today, I sincerely express my welcome to His Excellency Bose, who leads the 3 million Indians residing in East Asia to participate in the common front, and I raise my glass to wish His Excellency to fight to the end."</p>
<h3>Indian Organizations Federation Condemns British Imperialism</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 4th (Central News Agency) - Reuters reports that the Second Congress of the British Indian Organizations Federation passed a resolution stating that after 1942, the struggle in India temporarily stalled, but the Indian people's determination to overthrow British imperialism became more and more firm. Although they suffered oppression and famine, the morale of the people remained high. The current economic difficulties and oppressive system in India should be the responsibility of British imperialists. We demand a fair investigation, and those responsible for atrocities should be punished. Indians are conducting anti-British movements under the leadership of the National Assembly. Therefore, this Congress once again proves the determination of the Indian people to fight. The freedom of the Indian people is a prerequisite for world peace.</p>
<h3>Center of Eastern Front Warfare Shifts to Southern Hungary; German Heavy Troops Gather Near Lake Platten</h3>
<p>Somewhere in Hungary, 4th (Central News Agency) - Reuters reports: The Soviet army broke through north of the mouth of the Drava River in southern Hungary, starting from Mohacs, with great momentum, and has reached the northwest of Nagybajom. However, in the past 24 hours of the war, the situation has stabilized. Whether this breakthrough by the Soviet army can have strategic importance will be seen within days. The Soviet vanguard first encountered German armored units southwest and northeast of Lake Platten. Marshal Tolbukhin, the Soviet general, gave a speech to reporters on the front line, saying that the actions of the Soviet army would not become a blitzkrieg, because he knew that heavy German troops were gathered near Lake Platten.</p>
<p>Three Cities Abandoned in Northeastern Hungary</p>
<p>Although the center of the war has shifted to southern Hungary, the fighting in northeastern Hungary is still fierce. Although the German-Hungarian army abandoned Karcag, Eger, and Miskolc, it does not have much impact on the strategy. The German army will use the slopes of the Mátra and Bükk Mountains to exert its defense power. In short, the Soviet army's plan to encircle the Hungarian capital has not yet been determined.</p>
<p>Heavy Casualties for Invading European Troops</p>
<p>Headquarters of General Lundstedt, 4th (Central News Agency) - Reuters reports: Eisenhower's troops lost 8,000 tanks and between 40,000 and 50,000 personnel between Aachen and Düren, and more than half of the elite infantry and paratroopers of the anti-Axis forces have also been lost. The total strength of the anti-Axis forces invading Europe was 30 divisions in the first month, increased to 55 divisions in the second month, and is currently 80 divisions, not including 30 to 40 special divisions. Moreover, the anti-Axis forces are gradually losing their momentum, while the morale of the German army is increasing.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Situation Unfavorable to Britain and the United States</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 4th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports that according to news from Chongqing, Major General Wedemeyer, Commander of the U.S. Military Advisory Group in Chongqing, declared that the situation in Chongqing is extremely unfavorable to Britain and the United States. He continued that the Japanese army is not only well-equipped, but also well-trained in military affairs. As a result of the retreat, the U.S. military lost an important air force base.</p>

In addition to issuing alarms, these training alarms are also broadcast in advance through newspapers and radio stations. However, in addition to the above-mentioned scheduled training alarms, if a drill alarm is issued, it is a formal alarm, and the public should pay close attention.</p>
<h3>Third Anniversary of the Greater East Asia War; War Trophy Exhibition; Starting Tomorrow at the Army Dormitory</h3>
<p>It has been three years since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. The Allied forces are fighting more and more bravely, and the enemy troops are defeated and have reached an uncontrollable situation. The third anniversary is of great significance. Various groups in the city have arranged celebrations. It is learned that the East Asia Transportation Corporation and the Shanghai News Federation, with the support of the Shanghai Army News Department, will hold a "Third Anniversary of the Greater East Asia War Commemorative War Trophy and Photography Exhibition" from tomorrow (the 6th) to the 15th at the Army Dormitory (next to the International Hotel) at 150 Jing'an Temple Road. Enemy weapons captured on the front lines and valuable photos taken on the spot will be publicly displayed. It will be open to the public from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM every day, and no fees will be charged. The Municipal Education Bureau is holding a commemorative event for the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>Exhibition of Paintings by Chinese and Japanese Students</p>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau is holding an exchange exhibition of paintings by Chinese and Japanese elementary school students to commemorate the third anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. It has collected more than 1,000 paintings by Chinese and Japanese students. The planned method stipulates that the municipal He'an, Feihong, Chongdelu, Hunan, and Huxi elementary schools will take turns exhibiting for one week each, starting today.</p>
<h3>Hirayama and Others Return to Shanghai after Inspecting Air Defense in Japan</h3>
<p>The Municipal Air Defense Headquarters, believing that Allied Japan has solid and strong modern air defense facilities, specially sent Hirayama Ichiro, Chief of the General Affairs Section; Kobayashi Hisaji, Chief of Air Defense Guidance of the Police Defense Department; and Fuchi Haruaki, Deputy Director of the Fire Department, to Japan in early October for inspection. They visited Tokyo, Osaka, Manchuria, North China, and other places, and returned to Shanghai yesterday. According to Hirayama, when he went to Japan for inspection this time, enemy planes came to attack Tokyo on November 1. This air raid was the first since the air defense system was established on April 18, 1931. At that time, the citizens of Tokyo were exceptionally calm because they had been trained for a long time. Although several places in the suburbs were bombed, the actual losses suffered by the Japanese side were minimal. Because the ground air defense troops were prepared, the enemy planes were never able to carry out an attack. I watched from a high building at the time. Although I saw enemy planes dropping bombs, I did not hear any explosions because the Tokyo urban area was vast. It was estimated that 70 enemy planes were involved in this raid. On the evening of November 30, 20 enemy planes came again to attack. Because they were blindly dropping bombs in the clouds at high altitude, I hid in an air raid shelter for the first time after arriving in Japan. I felt no danger at all, even as if nothing had happened. From this, I thought of the Shanghai urban area, which should have similar air defense facilities as Tokyo. Citizens of Tokyo have long been proficient in air raid drills, so they are not only calm, but also very safe. Therefore, the enemy planes' blind bombing not only cannot stimulate morale, but even arouses great anger and hatred towards the enemy American actions. According to Kobayashi, during his time in Japan, when enemy planes attacked Tokyo, I thought the losses would be great. However, after investigation, the losses suffered were less than one-twentieth of what I had expected, which shows that the enemy planes' bombs were all blind and had no impact at all, simply wasting ammunition. It can be seen that the citizens of Tokyo have a well-planned air defense training program, and the ground air defense troops are well prepared. Therefore, they are prepared to deal with enemy planes attacking and will never allow the enemy Americans to show their skills. It is necessary for the citizens of Shanghai to learn from this.</p>
<h3>Dishonest Merchants Fuel Price Hikes; Citizens Should Not Panic</h3>
<p>Commodity prices in the city have been rising sharply in recent months. Although the economic authorities are conducting a rigorous investigation, speculators and hoarders are still lurking. A Central News Agency reporter inquired with the economic authorities. The price increases in mid-November (November) were greatest for rice, cooking oil, firewood, coal, and other daily necessities such as matches, candles, soap, cigarettes, and cotton fabrics. Although the people's hearts were slightly panicked due to the air raids, the (missing character) conclusion lies with illegal merchants who took advantage of the opportunity and the psychology of the people to deliberately spread rumors, incite unrest, hoard goods, and raise prices. The general ignorant people were deceived by this and rushed to buy the most essential daily necessities, and those holding the goods refused to sell them, so that prices could not be controlled. The authorities are paying attention to investigating and cracking down on this situation every day in order to stabilize the people's hearts. Overall, commodity prices rose by an average of 60% to 100% in mid-November. The authorities' measures to curb prices are continuing to rigorously investigate and crack down, but it is hoped that the public will not panic each other and rush to buy supplies, then the price hikes will naturally gradually subside.</p>
<h3>Navy Baojia District Presents Air Defense Water Pumps</h3>
<p>Citizens of the first to seventh districts of the Navy Reserve Baojia District, in view of the need for air defense equipment in the city, specially selected seven water pumps (i.e., pumps for pumping water) with money earned from their daily sweat and blood and presented them to the Shanghai Special Municipal Air Defense Headquarters. It is scheduled to hold the presentation ceremony for the 19th to 25th water pumps of the citizens at Kunshan Park on Chazhaopu Road at 10:00 AM today (the 5th). At that time, all the district chiefs, defense commissioners, and instructors below the chief of the Baojia District Office will participate in the ceremony, and the chiefs of the various departments of the Air Defense Headquarters and the chiefs of the various police stations in the district will also attend to provide guidance.</p>

<p>In order to actively reorganize the land registry in the Special, Fahua, Pusong, Yinxiang, Hunan, Zhabei, Caojing, Yangjing, Lihang, Tangqiao, and Gaohang districts of this city, the Municipal Land Administration Bureau has already begun processing the exchange of land certificates. It is stipulated that each owner can claim their new certificate two months after signing the land map or completing various procedures. It is now learned that the Bureau will no longer issue individual notices for this purpose. It is hoped that those who have not yet received their new certificates will go to claim them, and that those who have not yet completed the land certificate exchange procedures will not remain in a wait-and-see attitude, so as to avoid penalties.</p>

<h3>Shen Bao Basketball Cup Final Decided Last Night: Zhongbei Defeats Hualian; Two Teams Will Have a Rematch</h3>
<p>The final of the Shen Bao Cup Basketball League Group A took place last night with unprecedented grandeur. The audience was packed. Zhongbei defeated the perennial champion Hualian with an extremely excellent performance, which was a proud achievement. The final score was 38 to 27, with the halftime score being 17 to 8. Last night, Zhongbei's Li Zhenzhong was the center, commanding the game with composure. Shen Yugong's sudden jump shots were divinely inspired, and the team became more and more energetic as the game went on, leading all the way. Although Li Zhenzhong fouled out towards the end, it was insignificant. On the other hand, Hualian's performance was much worse than usual, panicked and confused, so they could not break through Zhongbei's strong defense. In terms of defense, they could not stop Li and Shen's attacks, and they were at a loss. They lost too many points in the first half and could not catch up. The strategy was wrong, and there was no way to recover. The two teams now have eight wins and one loss each, and the committee will meet to discuss the date and method of the rematch. In the Group B game last night, Zhenyuan defeated Linglong 28 to 8, with the halftime score being 12 to 4. Tongyi defeated Yilianfeng 26 to 15, with the halftime score being 14 to 5.</p>

<h3>Reader's Education Assistance News: Enthusiastic Response to Special Fundraising; Letter from Fengxian County Government from Afar</h3>
<p>Since the launch of the 8th Reader's Education Assistance Fund Special Fundraising Team, it has received enthusiastic responses and donations from readers. Yesterday, we received a letter from afar from Xu County Magistrate and others of the Fengxian County Government, donating 50,000 yuan to sponsor one team. The original letter stated: "Having read in the newspaper that your newspaper is organizing a special fundraising for education assistance, benefiting poor students, and has achieved remarkable results, we are deeply impressed. We have appropriated 50,000 yuan from the land tax revenue collection of our county to be used for the above-mentioned purpose, although it is just a drop in the bucket, we hope to set an example for other counties. Fengxian County Government Xu Chao, Zhang Ruiheng." The enthusiasm is commendable. In addition, the Qingjiao Old Friends Team and the Paris Wufu Team each donated 20,000 yuan. Hong Fuqian and Jiang Jinwu, managers of the Paris Grand Theater, have great sympathy for this newspaper's "Special Fundraising." In addition to generously donating a team in the name of Paris Wufu Company, they are also willing to solicit donations from various drama theaters and troupes to help alleviate the plight of the poor. The courage and enthusiasm of these two gentlemen are admirable. "Paris" had a contract with this newspaper from last October to this spring, renting the theater and holding charity performances by the Kuggan Theater Company, which achieved satisfactory results. Their sponsorship and fundraising this time further demonstrates their willingness to do what is right and their courage to act, for which we are deeply grateful. The theaters and troupes in Shanghai are not short of enthusiastic people, and we believe they will express their sympathy for this righteous act.</p>
<p>Last Day of Achievement Exhibition</p>
<p>Yesterday was the fourth day of the exhibition of student achievements of the sponsored students organized by the Reader's Education Assistance Fund Office of this newspaper, and it was designated as "Industry and Commerce Day." As expected, people from industry and commerce came in droves and expressed satisfaction with the achievements of the students in colleges, middle schools, and various groups. There were also many inscriptions and comments from guests, such as a certain industrial tycoon who wrote: "To gather and educate the talents of the world is truly beneficial to the nation and its people." A chairman of a large company commented: "This collective exhibition covers all subjects and is like an encyclopedia. Spending an hour viewing it is better than reading books for ten years." A well-known philanthropist wrote: "Poor students actually have such achievements. We donors have already reaped an unexpected harvest." Just these few sentences are telling. Yesterday, many young students also came to the exhibition to learn from each other. From an educational standpoint, it is very meaningful. It is hoped that enthusiastic people from industry and commerce will visit and provide guidance. Today is the last day and is designated as "Youth Day." It is hoped that professional youth from all walks of life will come to visit. As the poem says, "As if cutting, as if filing; as if chiseling, as if polishing." Strive to review, learn as much as possible, and you will benefit a lot.</p>

<h3>Emergency Relief for the Poor: Advancing the Congee Distribution; Cold Weather Clothing Registration Begins Immediately</h3>
<p>Since this office launched the cold weather clothing and congee distribution program, it has been met with responses and donations from all walks of life. Now, with the north wind howling and water freezing, this winter is the coldest in recent memory. At a time of high pressure on livelihoods, the poor are under the greatest threat. In order to implement the program as soon as possible to meet the expectations of donors, the contracted relay groups will advance the congee distribution to the 10th of this month, simultaneously at four locations:</p>
<p>(1) Zhongjiao Daoyi General Association, 98 Fengyu Lane, Nantong Road.</p>
<p>(2) Salvation Army Congee Distribution Center, 180 Xiamen Road.</p>
<p>(3) Guandi Temple, West Gate.</p>
<p>(4) Rende Lane, 6 Bairinan Road, Caojiadu.</p>
<p>Any poor people who wish to eat can register at the nearest location. After verification, a congee distribution certificate will be issued, and they can use the certificate to drink congee.</p>
<p>Regarding cold weather clothing, registration will also begin immediately. This office has application forms available for pickup. After completing the form, applicants should return it, and this office will entrust the Salvation Army office to send personnel to investigate. If it is verified, it will be issued immediately. However, this year it is not easy to purchase raw materials, and there are not many old clothes in storage. Therefore, the target for distribution is temporarily limited to (1) elderly widows and widowers, (2) disabled people, and (3) hidden poverty as the main objects, while supplies last. On the one hand, we are in contact to purchase cloth, and we will post notices in the newspaper at any time as soon as we have it, and then distribute it. Therefore, it is hoped that applicants will be limited to the truly poor, and that those who have already received it in the previous session will not continue to apply in this session. Also, all sectors are welcome to send old clothes or ready-made cold weather clothing to this office, and we will properly distribute them on your behalf.</p>

<h3>The Plight of Those Who Make Large Pancakes</h3>
<p>— Xu Wenyao</p>
<p>In today's Shanghai, where it is difficult to eat, large pancakes and fried dough sticks are the main food for the poor, but at present, large pancake shops are being forced to close due to the difficulty in collecting raw material flour, the high price, and the shortage of capital.</p>
<p>Originally, large pancakes and fried dough sticks were a humble food and had never been considered refined. Fortunately, they were occasionally used as refreshments by the middle class, but only to change the taste. After the price of white rice soared, large pancakes and fried dough sticks became widely consumed by all levels of society, and the selling price of large pancakes and fried dough sticks began to be noticed by the authorities. In the past, the price limit department of the former Public Works Bureau sent personnel to the major large pancake shops from time to time to check the selling price and the weight of the large pancakes.</p>
<p>In September of this year, the selling price of large pancakes and fried dough sticks soared from five yuan per piece to ten yuan per piece, and public opinion was in an uproar, because it affected the lives of the poor. Although the Municipal Economic Bureau and the Municipal Pancake, Steamed Bun, and Fried Food Industry Association persuaded to suppress it, it still rose to ten yuan per piece due to the high cost of raw materials and the lack of flour allocation. Subsequently, the Municipal Price Evaluation Committee officially set the price at eight yuan per piece, but it could not be implemented due to the extreme shortage of single tickets. Recently, flour has reached 6,000 yuan, and the prices of other raw materials have also been rising, and it seems that there may be another price increase. Those who have not increased the price have done so because they are restricted by the law, or have some inventory to temporarily maintain operations. After the last price increase, the turnover has been affected by discounts. In addition, those who make pancakes and steamed buns do not have detailed accounting for auditing, but only get by, eating up and losing all their capital and then closing down.</p>
<p>At present, the most painful thing for those who make large pancakes is that they cannot obtain special allocation items for adjustment, and the selling price of their products must be bound by the price limit. Sometimes, they touch the law and lose their materials due to collecting raw material flour. For example, recently, the Shanghai District Powder Bran Unified Distribution Office has been investigating and cracking down on the black market for flour in places such as stations. Many large pancake shop owners have also been affected when they purchase and sell flour from black market vendors. The author serves in the industry association and therefore has more detailed knowledge. The raw materials and costs of large pancakes and fried dough sticks have also been slightly studied, so the cost and the raw materials needed are listed below:</p>
<p>Calculation method of cost: (The sum of various raw materials plus profit and flour) multiplied by the number of bags plus expenses divided by the number of bags divided by the number of pounds, which is equal to the cost per pound.</p>
<p>Raw materials for large pancakes: flour (currently around 6,500 yuan per bag), sesame 2 pounds (around 150 yuan per pound), alkali 2 pounds (around 350 yuan per pound), salt 1 pound (80 yuan), coal 20 pounds (garbage coal about 40 yuan per pound), maltose 1 pound (230 yuan), can make 55 pounds of pancakes.</p>
<p>Raw materials for fried dough sticks: flour one bag, alkali three pounds, oil twenty pounds (about 6,000 yuan), alum two pounds (about 6,000 yuan per pound), salt two pounds, coal thirty pounds, can make about sixty pounds of fried dough sticks.</p>
<p>From the above table, it can be seen that using a bag of flour to make large pancakes at a selling price of ten yuan, you have to make nine hundred large pancakes to be enough for the cost of the raw materials used, and all other expenses are not included. If the cost of the above table is compared with the current sluggish business situation, the large pancake shop will gradually be unable to support itself and close down, which will be a matter of time; and large pancakes and fried dough sticks will also have a day of extinction. This involves the poor's staple food, large pancakes and fried dough sticks. Will the authorities think of a way to help?</p>

<h3>Twelve-Year-Old Elementary School Student Responds to the Childhood Welfare Association's Donation Drive</h3>
<p>The Chinese Childhood Welfare Association, facing financial difficulties, initiated a fundraising campaign. Receiving enthusiastic support from society, people eagerly contributed. Donations received have exceeded two million yuan, greatly benefiting children, which is truly admirable. However, the fundraising target is five million yuan, and only two-fifths have been reached. With the campaign scheduled to end on the tenth of this month, time is running short. Currently, all staff members of the association are intensifying their efforts, actively promoting the campaign to all sectors of society. They also earnestly hope that benevolent individuals, upholding the principle of "loving my young ones and extending that love to the young ones of others," will continue their efforts and generously donate to achieve the predetermined goal before the fundraising concludes. This would bring significant benefits to children.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the association received a letter yesterday from a young friend named Zhu Chenglie, stating: "As a twelve-year-old elementary school student, I am deeply honored to be entrusted by your association with the task of soliciting donations. However, due to my young age, I cannot donate a large sum. I have only managed to raise 18,500 yuan from my relatives and family members. I am also donating 1,500 yuan from my savings on candy, bringing the total to 20,000 yuan. The funds have been deposited at the Xinhua Bank and credited to your association's account. Although the donation is small, I have truly made my best effort." Young Zhu's courageous and righteous act of striving to help those in need is highly commendable. It is deeply hoped that all capable children in the city will embrace the spirit of "children helping children," save their candy money, and participate in disaster relief. If you wish to make a donation, the social services department of this newspaper can also collect it on your behalf.</p>
