<h3>中心信仰</h3>
<p>中心信仰是一個人的靈魂，是人類一切事業的發動機。有中心信仰的人意志堅定，有勇氣，有作爲，更能爲一般人所信仰。沒有中心信仰的人意志薄弱，畏葸遲疑，做不成事，更不能爲一般人所信仰。　　無論從歷史看，從現代看，古往今來，沒有一個　　偉大事業的人沒有他的中心信仰的。這些志士們抱定他們的信念，懷着滿腔的熱誠，不惜犧牲，不避勞苦，始終如一地進行他們的工作，不達目標，誓不中止。換句話說，就是有中心信仰的，決不以維持現狀爲滿足，而絕對堅決地完成他所信仰的中心目標。這種可驚可險的經過，每每在人類史上造成最燦爛光榮的一頁，使任何人感覺到興奮，使任何人立志圖強，眞如孟子所說，使百世之下，聞者莫不興起。　　中心信仰是精神力量，精神力量最最偉大，他可以創造物質力量。物質力量是有限的，精神力量是無窮的，物質力量是表面的，精神力量是蘊藏的，物質力量是有時間性的，精神力量是繼續不斷的，永久的。中心信仰使一個人意志堅定，目標認清，充滿着勇氣，創造出新的生命，好比火車，有蒸汽機推動着，向一定的目標前進。　　中心信仰不是迷信，迷信出於求福畏禍的心理，不是理智的。中心信仰不是妄想，妄想出於不可能的希冀心，也不是理智的。中心信仰是純理智的，他出於深的認識，長時期的研究，然後對於某一件事或某一種主義有澈底的信仰，因此就有最大的毅力去執行。深刻的認識可使人們有決心，有勇氣，長時期的研究可使人們有計劃，有步驟。所以中心信仰是一切的主宰，有中心信仰的人處處都可以表現出他的力量，處處都可以表現出他的作爲。沒有中心信仰的人只有徘徊，猶豫，盲目的無計劃的進，一會兒又盲目的無計劃的退，精神上失去主宰，那末行爲上就好比無舵的扁舟，飄蕩在大海之中，最後必至茫無所之而一事無成。所以，有了中心信仰，決不會發生動搖的。　　在戰爭時期的上海，因爲受過去英美的遺毒太深，更是一個謠言最多的都市。沒有中心信仰的人處在這樣一個五花八門的都市裹，時常要受別人的誘惑。要知道戰爭不過是一個表面的現象，戰爭的後面有一個最重要的主因，明瞭這個主因，一切亦都可以明瞭。假如大家深刻了解大東亞戰爭的主因，完全是被壓迫民族反對英美敵人的侵略，只有這個解放戰方才可以挽救危亡。從澈底的了解，進而爲整個的信仰。從整個的信仰，進而爲有計劃的進行，那末，任何環境都不能動搖我們的意志。因此，目前我們最需要大家有中心信仰，不過，如果希望一般人共有中心信仰，那末，政府領導者，社會領導者，必先以身作則，堅定中心信仰，絕不動搖，才可以樹立大家的中心信仰。</p>
<h3>帛琉島附近海面敵艦一艘被炸沉安格維爾島日軍對敵反擊</h3>
<p>中部太平洋基地十八日中央社電　十六日下午，於帛琉羣島附近海面游弋中之敵艦一艘（艦形未詳），於培里琉島東方海面炸沉。　　東京十八日中央社電　敵軍於機動部隊與猛烈砲火之掩護下，十七日晨在培里琉島西南之安格維爾島開始登陸，該島日軍正反擊中。　　東京十八日中央社電　十五日上午八時，敵麥克沃塞軍於培里琉島登陸時，並對摩鹿加羣島摩羅泰島企圖登陸，在航空母艦，戰艦等八十艘組成之大機動部隊猛烈砲擊下，開始於該島南端地區登陸，日軍部隊即予以邀擊，十六日激戰終日，連續展開血戰，然該島之敵，不顧日軍之奮戰，極力於南端地區確保地位，其兵力約有一師團。　　中部太平洋基地十八日中央社電　帛琉羣島方面，十六日白書有敵戰門機轟炸機一百十四架來襲，日軍擊落其兩架。又西里伯島根達里方面，十六日白書有敵機約三十架來襲。　　里斯本十八日中央社電　據培里琉島前綫美聯社記者十六日訊，該島登陸戰情形如次：十五日夜，日軍會夜襲美海軍陸戰隊橋頭堡，其一部已進入美軍左翼內側。按美軍於登陸之先，特加以熾烈砲擊，以是認爲該島日軍生者殆無幾人，然登陸後，日軍卻由各處相繼而來，對登陸美軍作猛烈攻擊，迨至夕刻，日軍更駛出戰車隊，其一部會突破美軍戰綫，但美軍終得維持橋頭堡。美軍爲奪取此島機塲，乃企圖前進，然日軍射擊激烈，美軍不得前展一步，尤於左翼一丘陵，似有日軍居在，然美軍大口徑砲竟未向該處大量攻射。該地美軍戰車及其他車輛，燄火連天，猛烈非常，日軍臼砲之威力，實堪恐懼。</p>
<h3>日政府昨舉行連絡懇談會興亞總本部強化陣容</h3>
<p>東京十八日中央社電　日政府，翼贊，翼政三方面連絡懇談會，爲響應國民運動，特於十八日晨在首相官邸舉行。出席者政府方面者有前田運通相，田中書記長，三清法制局長官，緒方情報局總裁三好情報局次長，山崎內務次官，緒方情報局總裁三好情報局次長，山崎內務次官，翼贊會方面有安藤事務總長，　井國民運動局長，林總務，翼政會方面有大麻五堂清瀨及三好等各總務，席間會就今後強力推進國民運動之方策，作種種懇談。　　東京十八日中央社電　日新亞總本部爲強化顧問及參事陣容起見，十八日任命前統理水野鍊太郎等七名爲顧問，任命言論報國會理事長鹿子木員信氏等三人爲參事，顧問水野鍊太郎，有田八郎，本莊茂，末次信正，本田熊太郎·建川美次，德富猪一郎，宇治田直美，鹿子木員信，佐藤多助，松室孝良。</p>
<h3>熾烈戰局下東京都素描</h3>
<p>東京十七日中央社電　東京隨戰局之日趨熾烈，刻正力謀實現所謂武裝化，或向地方疏散龐大之人口，或整備防空設施，凡此均足表現戰時首都之色彩，茲將最近情形與日本國民之必勝體制介紹如次：最使都民心情安定者，厥爲食糧之確保，且都民莫不詳悉，都內已有數月份之</p>
<h3>應急食糧</h3>
<p>於安全地方貯藏中，即或遭受空製，亦可由配給挺身隊使每個都民食無盧，食糧係配給制度，每日每人配給白米三三零公分，重要勞動者，爲五七零公分，因制度完善，故配給秩序井井有條，每月由配給員送至家中，副食品之菜類及魚肉等，每隔二日或四日配給一次，醬油，砂糖，食鹽及食用油脂等，皆按照厚生省國民榮養部研究之標準量配給。據厚生省調查，日本全</p>
<h3>國民體質</h3>
<p>較事變前並無何等變化，雖大阪·京都等地之幼兒體重平均減輕百分之三，但於四國之中國東北方各地，有較事變前增加百分之十五者，故以全國平均而論，國民之營養並未降低。此外，每家每月尚可配給酒五合或啤酒兩瓶，幼兒用牛乳，菓餅及病人用乳油等，按日人習慣，每至秋季食慾必增，故最近東京及其他各軍需都市，已實施配給每人罐頭兩個，此種罐頭之封紙，皆印有昭和十五年造字樣，故一般都民皆認爲，旣有五年前之存貨，自然可以無虞。關於東京之</p>
<h3>交通電車</h3>
<p>載數最近增加甚多，凡事務人員皆流行携一名爲奉公袋之雜囊，爲過去公事皮包與小布包之折中新型，內中盛以防毒口罩，裹腿，救急藥及防彈頭巾之類，以備空襲時萬一之需。又使用此種雜囊，雖於擁擠之電車中，亦可一手扶垂手，一手持報紙閱讀，較公事包便利實多。又此種雜囊，不僅公務員使用，於勞動者之間，即服務機關公塲之女性亦多使用，舊時女人所用皮包已不多見，惟僅於雜囊外懸以小袋，裝以口紅而已。關於</p>
<h3>出版事業</h3>
<p>，最近最極力節約用紙，但關於昂楊國民戰意之科學技術刋物，仍可發行一萬部至五萬部之多，出版書籍每月可達數百種，各書店中常有人滿之患，報紙自一日起會改爲每週出大型報二日，其餘四日爲小型報，編輯方針以簡明及不遺漏消息爲主，每日午飯後，於各工作地皆流行簡單明朗之歌曲。體育方面流行航空體操，於各工塲中往往可發現前往訪問之畫家，於美術方面，各美術家亦非常活躍，前綫之戰塲及軍事學校工塲等，常可發現其足跡，所有作品多滙集東京。下午</p>
<h3>劇塲影院</h3>
<p>不論大小皆異常擁擠，及至傍晚，最別具風味者，爲國民酒塲，嗜酒者多前往買醉。電車中常可見到佩帶報國隊腕章之學生，此類學生多係於飛機工塲及電波兵器工塲中工作者，東京學生之多，居日全國之首位，故此種學生之工作效率亦異常可觀，小學校學生之疏散，刻已大致竣事，街頭上小學生已不多見，電車售票生與省綫電車之買票口與剪票口，街上大載貨汽車之動轉，皆係</p>
<h3>婦女担當</h3>
<p>又國營各鐵路，亦漸次改用女子，同時，於街上飛駛之載貨汽車上，亦可見身着制服之女子，零物運搬夫，因此等女子之大批出動，於勞力及軍需工業生產率之增加上，貢獻頗多。</p>
<h3>保境蘇軍開入希領土里加爭奪戰益趨激烈</h3>
<p>貝爾格勒十八日中央社電　德國社訊，據來自斯丹埠之法方電訊稱：蘇軍已越過希腦與保加利亞邊界，而向底米希薩與薩朗尼加兩地前進。　　柏林十八日中央社電　德國社訊：巴斯加（Ｂauska）區乃北部戰綫蘇軍大規模進攻之焦點，蘇軍已有十師團之兵力到達里加，企圖使愛沙尼亞之德軍陷於孤立。莫當（Ｍodon）區蘇軍約六師與戰車數旅，於十五日開始猛攻，因遭德裝甲軍之猛攻，經激烈戰車戰後，卒將其擊潰。又伏爾加地區之戰事，亦極猛烈，蘇軍會以步兵十四師戰車四隊，企圖突入德軍陣地，但於里加西方二十公里地方，被德軍擊退。</p>
<h3>芬前綫德軍全部撤退</h3>
<p>柏林十八日中央社電　海通社訊：芬蘭甘達拉克廈（Kandalaksha）前綫之德軍，經三年之防守後，已於今日完全撤退，其原因爲蘇軍欲由北面包圍大部之德軍，故不得已完全撤退。在短期間內所有軍需均遷移，軍事設備炸毀或拆除。但蘇軍側擊隊終於切斷德軍之一退路，並在沙拉（Ｓala)以北之柯爾甲（Ｋorja）公路發生數日激戰，德軍於十三日突圍抵達指定地點。烏熙達及勞希前綫之避離行動，均依照預定時間進行，德軍現已越芬蘇界綫向西撤退。</p>
<h3>霍格蘭島上德芬軍衝突</h3>
<p>柏林十八日中央社電　海通社訊：負責方面息，德軍於星期五進修路芬蘭灣內之霍格蘭（Hogland）島時，與島上芬防軍起衝突，根據芬蘭停戰協定，該島應轉讓與蘇，然德軍爲保障本國及芬蘭之利益，並建立保護愛沙尼亞之防綫起見，不得不實行佔領，故該島芬守軍之態度，殊不利於其本國及波羅的海諸國人民。</p>
<h3>美潛艇擊沉日俘虜船</h3>
<p>東京十八日中央社電　本月七日，日運輸船載美軍俘虜七百五十名，於民答那峨海面航行中，突遭美潛艇雷擊，旋即沉沒，美軍俘虜七百五十人及日方船員均遭滅頂，關於詳細情形，俟調查正確後，即可登表。又六月二十六日，日俘虜運輸船一艘，於蘇門答臘海面，亦同樣遭美潛艇擊沉，所載俘虜七二○名中，除百八十名外，餘均遇救。</p>
<h3>滬寗車上</h3>
<p>— 閔賢</p>
<p>記者爲明瞭各階層實際情形起見，不利用任何幫助，自己費了九牛二虎之力，僥倖買得一張到鎭江的三等火車票，費時三時，臭汗幾身，所謂僥倖云者，因爲兩次均巳排到售票窗口，僅隔三數人而滿員牌子已經掛出，但是事後還有短褂歪帽數人在那裹呌賣着，[當天的車票，要哦？]問其票價，則較正價幾高出十倍，其手續，則購票入須先將市民證交其帶去，不過數分鐘，票即送來，錢票兩清，信用十足，這幾位掮客如何得來車票，想讀者不難會心了解吧！　　記者好容易有了車票，進大門時，又有留難，承老於旅行者告知，祇要再化點錢就可通行無阻，但記者爲減少麻煩計，祇得另拿出某種身份證，總算順利過進，進大門後，再行排隊，又擠出滿身大汗，最奇怪的是，記者爲三等乘客剪票進站之第十二人，而趕到車上，則乘客幾已滿座。最初以爲係二等乘客因無坐位來此移尊不教，事後逐一打聽，全係三等乘客，他們居然能捷足先進，不知又是什麼神通？總而言之，現在旅行，無時無地不帶有神秘性質。車開時，已經擠得水洩不通，極目一觀，當然仍以單幫客佔大多數，上一包下一袋，大小參差，百樣雜陳。但看他們的包裹布袋好像多已超過三十公斤，公然都能拿到車上，不知又有什麼玄妙方法？車內的形形色色到也值得一記，茲分述如左：</p>
<h3>話題的中心</h3>
<p>因爲大家擠得像沙丁魚，差不多都喘不過氣，惟一的消遣方法，祇有閒談聊天，歸納談話的主題，幾乎集中於生活高漲問題，由生活高漲而搆到鈔票價值，也有人大談其自己以爲理由十足心趨向如是，物價安得不日高一日，賢明當局未知作何妥善對策。</p>
<h3>單帮的打算</h3>
<p>話鋒又轉到跑單帮身上來了，首先發話的係一位江北大塊頭，他說：他跑了幾十趟，從來未觸過霉頭，所以致此，不外三種本領，即第一要忍耐得，無論怎樣寒熱擁擠飢餓要受得住。第二要捨得，遇見不可避免之需索時，須要捨得，落得交朋友。第三要狠，即次貨定要賣大價錢，不可講一點人情。說話時面現得意之色，指其所帶之笨重布袋三雙，表示除了他別人根本就拿不上車，此即他捨得之道。又有一個農夫模樣中年人說，跑單幫雖然苦點，但是比在家種田時，備受種種剝削，反不得]飽，痛快多了，現在雖不免有許多化費，但是羊毛出在羊身上，並不覺得心痛。又有一個中年婦人偕一少女，自術係姑嫂，謂其小姑原在家織布，現在跟她跑了幾次，比較織布有出息多了，此即單帮客越來越多的原因所在。</p>
<h3>合理的違法</h3>
<p>正談的時候，忽然寂靜下來，原來有三位制服朋友，已經走到車內，施行抽查，有志於跑單幫者早已接洽妥協，面帶會心的微笑，初出茅盧者無非多一番掙扎，少不得依然發生點微妙關係，安然放過，內中竟有一個老者，始終不肯化到標準數目，致將其香烟三條強行拿去，事後竟有人前來調停，謂他們要錢，都有一定分寸，合理的估計，絕不至傷你老本的，並且一次祇要一次開銷，不會再來麻煩，還是識相點好，車過常州時，見該老者巳將香烟取回下車，想必有了交代矣，此所謂盜亦有道歟！</p>
<h3>烏鴉一般黑</h3>
<p>好容易到了鎭江，記者脫離了沙丁魚式之擁擠，心神爲之一爽，行過檢同地方時，見有幾個單帮客人，贈送香烟毛巾等物與檢問同志，也有送代替品的，好像是熟識朋友，大概是檢問同志託他們代買的，或者代買品示購到而退還錢的吧！夫復何言！</p>

<h3>日軍佔領肇慶市內繼續激戰桂林美空軍開始撤退</h3>
<p>華南前綫某基地十八日中央社電　西江地區日軍之一部，於十六日黃錯攻入渝第三十六集團軍之重鎭肇慶市，刻仍在城內繼續激戰中。　　華南前綫十八日中央社電　自十三日以來，沿西江右岸猛進之日軍精銳，於十六日下午進入該江畔渝軍要衝肇慶之北，以先鋒部隊對該市加以猛攻，至是日下午四時三十分突入該市，更續以主力部隊掃蕩市內敗殘渝軍，遂將之完全佔領，又一部有力日軍，繼佔領該市後，於西北方進擊由該市敗退之渝軍第一百五十九師之一部，刻正擴大戰果中。</p>
<h3>桂林機塲均被破壞</h3>
<p>里斯本十八日中央社電　湘桂省境日軍由兩方積極壓迫桂林，渝美軍第十四航空部隊中心基地之桂林，現已失去戰略價值，故渝美軍現已開始壞破之。關此，據美第十四航空部隊司令部之美聯記者十七日訊，日軍由湘桂鐵路及廣東北部，兩方夾擊，於是航空基地中樞之桂林美軍，業已全部撤退，桂林機塲除戰門機使用之一小滑翔道外，均被破壞，司令部之設施，及倉庫武器彈藥燃料等，均巳放棄或爆炸，第十四美軍航空部隊二年前勞心建設之桂林基地，今已完全破毀。</p>
<h3>粵日軍西攻懷集縣</h3>
<p>里斯本十八日中央社電　合衆社駐渝防員，頃就日軍進攻桂林之戰況報稱，日軍爲響應沿湘桂鐵路南下作戰，自廣東省北西部開始行動，現以四隊沿西部之綏江一路向西方進攻，某一隊日軍現已突破省境，進入廣西省境，向懷集縣進攻云。又據美聯社消息，日軍四隊自廣東省進攻，現已迫東西切斷中國大陸之間隙，壓縮至百九十公里云。又據路透社消息，桂林攻防戰現已開始，且謂渝軍陣營甚爲紊亂。　　廣州十八日中央社電　據重慶電稱，日軍攻略全縣後，刻已到達距桂林四十六公里之地點。</p>
<h3>日軍突入四會縣城</h3>
<p>華南前綫十八日中央社電　華南日軍結集於北江右岸，待機中之精銳，突於九日晨開始活動，沿四清公路開始進攻，冒一切艱難，以破竹之勢繼續進擊，於十一日突入綏江北畔要衝四會縣城，頃繼續擴大戰果中。</p>
<h3>日機又襲柳州機塲</h3>
<p>大陸基地十八日中央社電　日機精銳十七日黎明強襲渝軍基地柳州，在猛烈之防空砲火中，轟炸其機塲之掩體地區，其中二處中彈起火，日機全部安返。因日機近日之陸續強襲，渝美機已失蠢動之餘地，即夜間渝美機亦完全沉默矣。</p>
<h3>渡江日軍佔領樂清</h3>
<p>浙南前綫基地十八日中央社電　日軍於九日進入溫州縣城後，更於十日及十一日午駐渝美空軍猛炸下，決行甄江渡河，十二日晨開始沿甌江進攻，是日下午佔領樂清縣，盤石街（溫州東北卅公里），已確保甌江河口地區。</p>
<h3>中樞紀念週</h3>

<h3>重慶參政會不滿渝方施政國共磨擦團結綦難</h3>
<p>中央社訊　關於渝共磨擦糾紛之演進，其變化將影響暗示國際上種種磨擦。如今英美方面，在現階段對日本之作戰進行中，乃利用渝方力量，在中國大陸打擊日軍外，並須用中共力　牽制監視日軍，因此英美竟願盼望渝共團結，則可對其本身有利。然而蘇聯之態度，不以爲然，蘇之利用中共力量，以監視英美及渝方，絕不願英美左右中國力量。是以英美之希望渝共團結，從而蘇聯加緊從中阻撓，看中英美之弱點進行。故目前渝共團結殊難實行，不啻同牀異夢。渝共磨擦內幕，如逼迫渝宣傳部長梁寒操之聲明等，方式不一，在彼此幕後指使人之從恿，事態只見擴大。頃據本市有關方面所得之消息，關於中共攻擊渝方頗詳，茲將渝國民參政會情形分誌如次：</p>
<h3>渝共言論針鋒相對</h3>
<p>○查本月五日晨，渝國民參政會在渝開幕之第一日，蔣介石亦赴會主持，而共黨方面則對蔣親自主持，大爲不滿，嚴加批評。據共黨意見，對於目前中國戰塲上之嚴重形勢忽略，祇以輕率自期空洞字句（因渝蔣演詞冗長）加以掩飾，其結果將模糊人民警惕，鬆懈人民抗戰意旨，麻木人民[抗戰]動員。尤其渝蔣所言今日[抗戰]，亦爲國家之統一云云。因此共黨對渝方之政見，即統一國民黨，即統一獨裁政治而論，與全國民衆之自由生存獨立的民主國家統一論，完全作爲針鋒相對而論，故是項情勢，足以表示渝蔣深固獨裁之孤見，而且強烈暗示準備內戰之威脅，故蔣之演說，已引起參政員之不良反響。參政員方面，由林虎代表全體，提出答覆，深表不滿，要求排除改革眞正的弊端。據林所稱，我們廻顧國家制度，瞭望前途，不但不稍感樂觀，且足爲杞人之憂，在此困難存亡關頭之秋，如果發奮振作，革除積弊，則即轉機新生，否則其前途不堪設想。</p>
<h3>一致不滿政府施策</h3>
<p>○渝參政會之會期其爲七日，自一日至七日，爲政府各部院施政報告。然參政員所提出之質問，每日渝方中央社及合衆亂所發報告，指出爲包括軍政，外交，經濟，財政，糧政，社會，內政，教育，交通，司法，行政，等十部報告，僅羅致日常瑣事，因此在目前情形至爲嚴重危險，惟在全國民衆對此要求，渝政權並無反省之處，單以軍政部長何應欽之報告論，此次湘渝作戰之大敗，渝方朝野一致憤激之時，猶圖自欺欺人自圓說其詞。據何稱：各戰塲渝軍攻守兼施，隨時給予重大消耗，而財政部次長俞鴻鈞之報告，則對貪污盛行，財政瀕於破產隻字不提，僅述財政制度着重於田賦征購征借方面，務求做到公正無弊，便利人民原則等等。故此項報告，當引起參政院之不滿，而參政員周炳琳之要求各部院長官，注重於政策方面，於是出席之一百二十個參政員，均站立請財政軍政兩部，向政府要求改善兵員公教人員之待遇，具體辦法，提交於該會討論。同時參政會各會員猛烈提出政府之腐敗，且有一參政員，並稱如經過私人關係在政府中可取得高官厚爵，試觀機關中賄賂事件之存在如負責征收實物，各地竟有官員實行敲詐情事，使農民遭受不應得之痛苦，並有豫籍參政員郭仲瑰，對河南所見所聞，向大會作生動之報告，關於渝軍之在河南兩戰塲，不戰而潰引起異常憤怒。在社會部長谷正綱報告後，參政員周炳琳，將昆明所見路斃情事提出報告，認社會救濟工作最需要之同情心，今已泯滅。同時參政員江一平所詢問之社會部是否可將社會病態掃除，此外並有黃炎培·王雲五·左舜生·王立明等人，提出關於保護人士自由問題之質問。總之，在渝政權各部之施政報告，及各參政員之責問，國民黨企圖在正面掩飾空前危急情況，依然原封不動，維持其獨裁孤立政制統治，同時亦局部反映全國人民與國民黨內部，對統治國民黨者的激烈憤怒。</p>
<h3>檢查報紙箝制輿論</h3>
<p>○本月十二日解放日報之[言論自由之後]之社論，言詞乃攻擊渝方言論自由問題。本年四月，渝宣傳部長梁寒操對中外記者發表談話，承認國民黨審查制度，在技術上有缺點，甚至錯誤。並宣布放寬尺度，至五月間，國民黨十二中全會宣告對公正之輿論，其言論應爲揭發事弊，宣達民隱，並通過改進出版檢查要點一案，局部廢止事前送檢，迨至六月公佈審查辦法，及禁載標準，和木板審查規則，由於國民黨宣布禁載之解釋，此項條例主要內容，不以論述軍事政治外交爲目的之雜誌，則由著作發行人自行審查，並仍負法律上之責任。且可在出版後再行查禁，其禁載標準，重要者有一，違背立法最高原則者的解釋，挑撥各民族之團結者，鼓吹侵略主義者，鼓吹法西斯主義，或階級獨裁理論者，鼓吹私人　慚者，危害國家及破壞公共秩序者。二，妨害本國及友邦信誼，或同盟國團結者等。其解釋上已有規定之種種辦法，因在條例之本身弊病頗多，此足謂國民黨之獨裁表現。例如各每日出版之報章，在五月份未刋出或被刪去之社論外論及消息等，而已被發刋之部份，共有三十三篇，其中包括主張民主團結者共十二篇，其餘則包括各黨派等等，而渝立法院長孫科，在國民中央訓練團所發表演說論文，亦未刋出。此外在本月十五日美籍記者批評林語堂之言論，詞句荒謬，而外報訊亦未刋出。如此嚴重情形，何以能言之爲言論自由。</p>
<h3>孔之評論認識不夠</h3>
<p>○本月十日孔祥熙在美華盛頓俱樂部所述者，對於中共之嚴重批評，完全缺乏時局認識。孔對軍事問題，言中國從未將美供應品移充對日作戰以外之作用，且稱美國之租借品，乃武裝國民黨最精良之部隊，我人可以孔之說謊，而觀至困囚於[抗日]民主根據地之邊區，則已可知達何程度，旋孔又說到渝軍武裝作戰之效力時，渝軍有大砲戰車，則作戰精神不下於任何國家之軍隊云云，故孔之膽大妄語，與事實適得其反。再以渝之政治經濟各方之全部政策，則即有任何數量之大砲及戰車，亦難以提高渝軍之戰門量，以孔在政治上論，有人認爲中國並非爲民主國家，惟渝方則決定在戰爭結束後之一年中，將召開國民大會，制定憲法。並稱渝政權決將履行此諾言云。關於經濟方面，孔則稱能採控制通貸膨脹之程度，以獲得更高之評價，然獨孔已忘記渠在七月四日之談話，會言大後方在一九四四年之預算，稅收占百分之五十二，但是項稅收標準，是否實現，猶有疑問。故孔之下文乃稱不得不大部依賴銀行貨款，其結果必增加購買力，並促成物價之高漲，故渝方上月之物價指數，超出本年二三月至六月，激漲二倍以上，其糧食達一千二百倍以上。以是孔所說之渝政權未能在軍事·政治·社會上之統一意見，而遭受破壞，此乃國會上之孤立統一論之重複情形。</p>
<h3>英美傘兵部隊在荷境降陸德軍圍攻殲滅其大半</h3>
<p>柏林十八日中央社電　德國社訊：反軸心軍在過去數日內，企圖突破此耳德河口與繆斯河附近之德軍障礙陣地未果，然後於星期日下午英美軍以強大之空輸部隊在荷蘭南部之提爾堡（Tilburg）愛恩霍芬（Eindhoven）與尼美根（Ｎijmegen）在萊茵河南岸鄰近德境）等區降陸，德軍立即向降陸之敵分隊進攻。　　柏林十八日中央社電　德國社訊：星期日下午由大隊空軍保護，在德荷邊界迤西萊茵河北岸降陸之英美空輸部隊，已蒙受重大損失。在傘兵降陸之後，繼以不少運貨滑翔機之降陸，該區德軍立即與敵作戰，包圍已着陸之敵部隊而殲滅其大部份。</p>

<h3>從蘇聯歸來</h3>
<p>五年計劃的成績　　這些設備的撤退工作，極爲困難。知用列車裝載，任裝幾個月也不足爲奇。又一部分早到了，另一部分則幾個月也不到。列車費盡氣力到達目的地的時候，旣無起卸貨物的塲所，又無勞働者的住家。這種塲合頗多。且這些都是在西伯里亞的酷寒天氣所遭遇的事態。　　這是另一家蘇報的　　。可見在內地裝置之前，也已費了非同尋常的心血了。戰爭第二年即一九四二年底時，這些移轉內地的工廠大體裝置完畢，開始工作。飛機，大砲，戰車等的生產力，當時已經恢復到撤退前的情形了。蓋東方地區在戰前已有三次的五年計劃建設得成績可觀，所以撤退的設備利用當地原有的建築物，設備，並加以若干設施，然後撤退的設備與人役始可活動。　　鋼鐵的意志　　歷時三年二個月的德蘇戰爭，使史太林得到了一獻身手的機會。臨到存亡危急之秋不能不拿出全部力量來應付，個人如此，國家亦然。史太林政治是獨裁政治的類型之一，蘇聯在此次戰爭的發展途上，臨到生死關頭時，其鋼鐵的意志與不動的信念，與其執着，強覇的性格，同時清晰地表現於全世界人士前面了。　　一九四一年夏，德軍進迫列寗格勒周圍時，史太林氏屢次命令死守革命的搖籃地列寗市，防衛該地的紅軍與市民，雖積屍如山，亦不放棄最後一綫。但史太林的鋼鐵般意志受到最苛酷的試騐者，不能不說是莫斯科攻防戰。　　從斯摩倫斯克方面以破竹之勢直衝首都的德軍，擊散了守衛莫斯科前面的紅軍。正當德軍先鋒部隊以戰車，機械化部隊的快速力欲一舉而突入莫斯科市內，形勢緊迫萬分時，行政，外交部門的政府機關，都離開首都，同年十一月七日的革命紀念日，加里寗，伏洛希洛夫，安特烈夫，許倍尼克，伏茲納森斯基等黨的首腦部，出現於庫壁希夫。當時莫斯科市民間充滿着絕望的空氣。蘇聯的聯合國英美的無綫電，對紅軍失望，而洩露丟棄俄國的口吻。這時候阻止德軍的突進，終於旋轉乾坤，使局勢一變者，不是史氏的鋼鐵般意志與不敗的信念所致嗎？　　他令政府機關，黨首腦部，市民從首都撤退，自己則與莫洛托夫等許多人在克林姆宮的防空壕內，拿起電話機，鼓舞激盛在莫斯科郊外數十公里之綫奮戰的紅軍士兵，蘇聯報紙會詳載當時的情形。屢次徬徨於生死之巷鍛鍊自己的史氏，雖在危機臨頭，其鐵的意志與不敗信念，正如蘇報所稱，如山嶽般屹然不動。　　視死如歸的最高命令　　在此次戰爭中顯露其全貌的所謂史太林戰術，其內容非常簡單，俄羅斯的防衛戰爭，自古即以退避戰術著稱。遠在紀元前五二一年，斯基夫族巧妙地將波斯王格留斯的侵俄軍引至內地，打敗優勢的波斯軍，故亦稱斯基夫戰術。一八一二年的拿破崙戰爭時，巴克萊，庫索夫軍司令官等，顯然用這斯基夫戰術困束拿破崙。　　此次的德蘇戰爭，也有許多軍事評論家將史太林戰術與斯基夫的[退避戰術]等量齊觀，余不以爲然。余以爲史太林最高司令官並不像巴克萊總司令官，及綱其後的庫索夫般，採有計劃的退避作戰。莫斯科最近舉行的公開演講，更證明了我這個見解。　　史氏在戰爭前半段的防衛戰階段中，始終是頑抗主義者。寸步不讓於敵！寸土不棄於敵！以死阻止敵的前進！在本位頑抗至最後！頑抗！這是他常給與前綫兵士的最高命令。　　從一般的戰術理論說來幾毫無價值的地域或地點，也不惜人命死守。當德軍已達伏爾伽河岸，伏爾伽交通被遮斷，史太林格勒市的主要部份已落德軍手中時，仍付出了那麼大的犧牲，死守史市的一角，史太林戰術的眞諦，在這裹發揮無遺。因爲築起了這樣的屍山肉壁，使德國的戰車機械化部隊不能前進一步，這時候，蘇聯的國民動員進展了，動員的部隊這訓練也告終了，加以烏拉爾，西比利亞，中央亞細亞，與俄國內地的生產力也擴充了，更藉時間的餘裕，而英美加拿大及其他聯合國家之物的及人的資源也動員了，戰力化了。在那以前，頑抗主義是必要的，史氏是這樣想着。（完）（翔：譯自八月二十六日朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>銀錢業各行莊提高存放利息</h3>
<p>本市銀錢業各行莊，因近年來物價高漲，不免受投機囤戶之操縱，影響工商經濟甚鉅，銀錢行莊同業本身業務，亦受不良影響。現悉各行莊爲吸收存款，防杜投機商利用資金囤積居奇，而維本身正當業務起見，特將同業在來存欠息，略予提高外，對客戶活期存款，提高百分之五十，抵押放款最低六分，最高爲一角四分，普通均在一角左右，惟抵押擔保品及借貸用途，尚須審愼辦理，故如此情形，投機囤戶或可漸見消滅內定本月二十一日起全市各處食糖零售處，一致開始發售。</p>
<h3>黃豆搬入上海的情況</h3>
<p>— 栗本寅治</p>
<p>油糧統制委員會自接受商統會委讓雜糧移動許可事務以來，至本日業已半月。在這二星期內（實際處理許可事務的日數僅十一天），同業的黃豆搬入許可申請數大約爲一千餘噸，每日平均百噸左右。產地均爲江南地區。　　本年黃豆的收獲，極爲有望，故此後上市情形，將漸趨旺盛。是以迄今日至的許可申請，僅爲其序曲。將產地市價與上海市價比較時，同業頗覺有利可圖，故紛請搬入。此種物資流通的情形，如從目前上海及四鄉的經濟情形觀察起來，是很好的現象。　　抑且這黃豆一自搬入上海以後，如無特別情形，恐不致再流出外埠。大多供作上海四百萬市民的副食糧。目前上海每日黃豆的消費量，除醬圓釀　以外，大槪爲四十噸左右。至榨油廠的消費，各油廠今因電力不足，停止工作，故該方面的消費，不成問題，而釀醬則須視季節而定，尚須稍緩。　　這些黃豆的大部分，不用說，乃供市民食用，那麼，搬入許可申請量，正足供市民二十五日的需用。而這申請黃豆的進口，早則本月中旬，至遲爲十月上旬。且今爲登市的初期，祇要市價合於業者的打算，搬入量自將急增，所以上海決不會有黃豆缺乏之虞。不過所應考慮者，這些黃豆的收買資金，完全是業者自己的資金，並無別種特殊金融，至於業者用自己的資金究能搬入多少數量，此則祇有徽之於今後的實際。不過假使業者的資金不定·爲加速資金流轉的速度，到貨勢必逐漸放出於市塲。而且假使業者有相當利潤可圖，則不致囤積起來，喜歡使資金呆定。因而勢必設法使資金流轉的速度加速。如果運轉略見好轉，則引種物資的流動，資金的流轉，自然使業界並市塲明朗化。需要方面也安心了。供給方面也不會無理。在促進全面經濟的正常化上，成爲偉大的力量。黃豆一項因無需特殊金融，也沒有資金的汜濫，故這一點在金融方策上也可說極有意義。　　中國自動參加大東亞戰，業已一年數月，戰局將達苛烈的決戰階段。數日前申報社評上強調謂[先公後私]，我同業實亦不能不堅持實行。　　油糧統制會對於有關物資的處置，也常冀求同業[先公後私]，且尊重同業的利益，謀生產者的優遇，並以安定民生，增強戰力爲其最大目標以推進業務。在這意義上，其方策之一，屢次將各物品的實情，在可能範圍內藉油統會資料從速公開，以求同業協力，並資一般市民的參考。</p>
<h3>抑平物價小組會舉行首次會議</h3>
<p>經濟局密查非法漲價　　市經濟局抑平物價小組委員會，於昨（十八）日下午三特在該局會議室舉行第一次會議，計到水產管理局長等，席間對於如何抑平本市物價，安定民生，各方案詳爲討論，至五時許始畢。　　邇來本市物價問題嚴重，緣在各業不法商人暗中抬價事，竟有得各該業公會准許，殊屬非是，不獨影響民生，且有違政府功令，聞經濟關係當局對於此種同業公會會員非法抬價行爲，已在密查中，查出定當嚴懲。</p>
<h3>實部取締商號擅用公司名義</h3>
<p>實業部以公司爲法人，非經本店所在地主管官署之許可登記，不得成立，原爲公司法第三第五兩條明文所規定，故所有獨資經營或合夥性質之商號曁未經依法登記之公司，均不得使用公司名稱。該部近據報有非公司組織商號，採用公司字樣情事，顯有違反法令，自應嚴加取締，以符名實，業已分咨各省市政府轉飭所屬主管機關，一體遵照，希本市各商號切實注意。</p>

<h3>前工部局華童學校之教育性格</h3>
<p>— 上野太忠</p>
<p>○待遇之優異　　前工部局學校教職員待遇之優異，似已爲社會人士所公認。但究竟優異至若何程序，不可不知。其實此種待遇，乃至界各先進國家，對於公務人員應有之待遇。特中國對於用人行政，尚在萌芽，故顯然覺其不同。至於中西人員待遇之不同，雖在同一機關，任同一職務，相差可達數倍，故言待遇優異，應指西人，華人不過附屬而已。茲略述華人待遇如次：　　教職員分有聘書與無聘書兩種。高級者有聘書，待遇一切詳載聘書中，分別稍詳，達百餘項之多，如有大同小異之點。茲因限於篇幅，祇能略述梗槪。　　一·工作之安定　前華童學校教職員生活之安定，最爲顯著。祇要沒有什麼大過失，學校從來沒有將教師撤職或不繼續聘用的，無論處長校長人選更迭，決不影響教師的工作，所以往往有師生同事或父子共職的趣聞，也有畢生執教於一校，老死於職事的事實。華童公學，儘有許多髯子老兒，他們都會爲母校盡瘁數十年，門下桃李盈千人了。　　二，本薪之標準　以學歷資格而定教職員之等第，大體而言，中學一級教師之薪俸，略相當於國立大學教授。二三級以次，亦較省立中學教師高十分之三以上。至於小學教師，其薪俸並不顯較中學爲低，亦看其資格而定等級與薪俸標準。（註五）　　三，年功加俸　教職員每年達一定日期，舉行年功加俸。通常爲滿一週年，加薪一次。高級教職員，亦有每三年加一次者，視其所簽聘書而定。每次加俸量，計分最高級中級最低級三種。平均約當總俸標準，槪視勞績而定。但事實上，[年功]二字，寗特別注重[年]字，故加俸時，鮮有加最少級者。　　四，薪俸以外之各種利益。（註七）　　甲，退職儲金　每月扣本薪百分之五，作爲退職儲金。此外工部局復津貼該儲金兩倍之數，合併計算本利。利息約爲常年六厘，視工部局經濟情形而定。儲金本利總和，於每年十月初，由財務處分別以書面報告各職教員，並聲明隨時可以由本人查賬。　　乙，退職金　凡教職員在局立學校服務達廿年以上，經主管機關長宮認可者，退職時得享受該年年俸總和百分之五，乘以服務年數這退職金，爲數也很可觀。　　丙，死亡病廢等卹金病廢者，經工部局醫務委員會查明屬實，准予退職。並可發給與死亡同等之卹金，卹金計算方法，與退職金同，但不必服務二十年以上。此外死亡者，並由局方津貼死者家屬以相當之喪葬費。　　丁，疾病處置　此點，依教職員之等級及聘書規定而不同，其主要之點爲：　　子·規定定額之醫業費。申報杯籃球賽</p>

<h3>限制用電以後</h3>
<p>— 惕言</p>
<p>此次電力公司爲促進生產，再事限制電流消耗之用意，自無異議；惟關於居戶一律限用百分之五十，實不敢贊同。蓋上海之平民化弄堂房屋，每幢大多住有七八家附戶，平時用電已經節無可節，此次所限每月用電僅有十三度，雖竭力節省，亦僅夠半月之耗。二房東於規定電量用罄之後，即關閉總火表，以免同居私用逾限，致受剪綫之損害，而附戶亦惟有忍受高昂之代價，改以燈草素油代替。這一來電流是節省了，而未來火患之易起，自非杞人之憂。尤其住於樓上之人，設夜半遇有火警，燬物事小，似此黑暗一團，益之人心慌亂，其能免於焚斃人命慘劇之演出，則未敢言必也！　　至家有學齡之兒童，每晚於微弱光下，溫習書算，目力受害，則更無一顧之價值矣！　　然如一幢之屋，僅住一家者，則不可同日而語，蓋其房間雖多，無事時，家人園坐一室，其話家家；雖受限制，而電力則仍綽有餘裕，用之旣不竭，則繼之以電爐，以達到免除再減限度之虞，且可省卻高昂之燃料費用也，苦樂不均，莫此爲甚！筆者之意，最好命二房東送閱戶口表，查核附戶之多寡，以每一附戶僅許點用若干支光燈頭一盞爲標準，規定用電總量，庶孚節約原旨，而物亦得盡其有利之用，想電力公司不乏高見之士，定有調整此種不合理之限制，以告慰吾人也！</p>

<h3>雷雨（四）</h3>
<p>— 岩田豐雄著洪洋譯</p>
<p>隆夫心中忐忑不定地拿着畫好的畫，去交卷。　　[眞不錯！]　　飛田中校這樣個三字的評語，就通過了。立刻把畫轉到海軍省記者團黑潮會的寫眞班去了。　　（那怎麼能行？）　　隆夫羞答答地回到自己的辦公室去了。　　準備不充足，也一定是一個失敗的原因，所以他不再等得命令，而永久舖上紙在候命了。　　就是這樣，他的心靈仍然還是不安。　　（呵，明拍了，太興奮是不行的。忘記畫畫是不行的。）　　當他發現自己根本缺陷的時候，第二次畫畫的命令又來了。　　此次是畫英國的。十二月十日，在關潭海面上擊沉永不沉沒的威爾斯親王號無畏艦和雷巴爾斯號戰門艦。震驚全世界的這樣大戰果，又是我們日本飛機的功績。　　隆夫對於威爾斯親王號戰艦，軍純知道防空設備方面，至於其他則漠然不清了。　　（我要描寫一張奇跡畫。我要在現代，作一件意大利中世紀畫家的工作。）　　於是他在畫紙的最高處畫了一架大雷擊機。在雷擊機的周圍，想畫一光圈，但想到報道畫的任務時，就作罷了。　　然而此次所完成的畫，他也不滿意。只覺着比第一次強些。　　於十二月十八日下午三時，眞珠灣襲擊的詳報發表了。每一個人都感覺到此次大戰果，完全像隱藏於雲霧中的龍，全身出現了。加利佛尼亞型的戰艦也被擊沉了。梅利蘭型，阿利遜型，猶太型，諾巴達型，——其能修理者，只不過一艘戰鬥艦，兩艘乙級巡洋艦而已。美國的太平洋艦隊，幾乎全部擊毀了。同時，給與敵方航空兵力的損失，也非常的大。　　（飛機的力量眞大呵！）　　隆夫又重覆一句感激的話。　　但發表的第二段，還說：在該海戰中特別攻擊隊會建有無上奇勳。此外第三段，就是說我方的損失：飛機二十九架，尚未歸還的特殊潛航艇五艘。　　（特殊潛航艇是什麼？是什麼艦呢？）　　因發表簡單，受到悲壯的感動並不大者，並不是隆夫一個人。（一四二）</p>

        <h1>1944 - n259</h1>
<h3>Central Belief</h3>
<p>A central belief is a person's soul, the engine of all human endeavors. Those with a central belief have unwavering will, courage, and accomplishment, and are more readily believed by the general public. Those without a central belief are weak-willed, hesitant, and indecisive, unable to accomplish anything, and even less able to be believed by the general public.</p>
<p>Whether looking at history or the present, there has never been a person with a great career who did not have a central belief. These men of lofty ideals, embracing their convictions with ardent enthusiasm, spared no sacrifice and shunned no hardship, consistently pursuing their work until their goals were achieved. In other words, those with a central belief are never satisfied with maintaining the status quo, but resolutely and decisively complete the central goal they believe in. Such astonishing and perilous experiences often create the most brilliant and glorious pages in human history, inspiring anyone who feels it and motivating anyone to strive for strength, just as Mencius said, causing excitement in those who hear of it even hundreds of years later.</p>
<p>Central belief is spiritual strength, and spiritual strength is the greatest of all. It can create material strength. Material strength is limited, while spiritual strength is infinite. Material strength is superficial, while spiritual strength is latent. Material strength is time-bound, while spiritual strength is continuous and eternal. A central belief makes a person's will unwavering, their goals clear, filling them with courage to create new life, just like a train propelled by a steam engine, advancing toward a definite destination.</p>
<p>Central belief is not superstition. Superstition arises from the psychology of seeking blessings and fearing misfortune; it is not rational. Central belief is not delusion. Delusion arises from impossible hopes; it is also not rational. Central belief is purely rational. It stems from deep understanding and prolonged research, and then a thorough belief in a certain matter or ideology, thus giving rise to the greatest perseverance in its execution. Profound understanding enables people to have determination and courage, while long-term research enables people to have plans and steps. Therefore, central belief is the master of everything. Those with a central belief can demonstrate their power and achievements everywhere. Those without a central belief can only wander, hesitate, advance blindly without a plan, and then retreat blindly without a plan. Lacking a master in spirit, their behavior is like a rudderless skiff, drifting in the vast ocean, ultimately leading to nowhere and accomplishing nothing. Therefore, with a central belief, wavering will never occur.</p>
<p>In wartime Shanghai, because of the deep-seated legacy of Anglo-American influence, it is a city rife with rumors. Those without a central belief, placed in such a diverse city, are often tempted by others. One must understand that war is merely a superficial phenomenon. Behind the war lies the most important root cause. Understanding this root cause clarifies everything. If everyone deeply understands the root cause of the Greater East Asia War, that it is the oppressed nations opposing the aggression of the Anglo-American enemies, only this war of liberation can save us from peril. From thorough understanding, advance to complete belief. From complete belief, advance to planned action. Then, no environment can shake our will. Therefore, at present, what we need most is for everyone to have a central belief. However, if we hope that the general public shares a central belief, then government leaders and social leaders must first lead by example, firmly upholding their central belief without wavering, in order to establish a central belief for everyone.</p>
<h3>Enemy Ship Sunk Near Palau Islands, Japanese Forces on Angaur Island Counterattack</h3>
<p>Central Pacific Base, 18th (Central News Agency dispatch) – On the afternoon of the 16th, an enemy ship (type unknown) cruising in the waters near the Palau Islands was sunk east of Peleliu Island.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Under the cover of a mobile force and intense artillery fire, enemy forces began landing on Angaur Island, southwest of Peleliu Island, on the morning of the 17th. Japanese forces on the island are currently counterattacking.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency dispatch) – When enemy MacArthur forces landed on Peleliu Island at 8:00 AM on the 15th, they also attempted to land on Morotai Island in the Moluccas. Under the intense shelling of a large mobile force consisting of aircraft carriers, battleships, and other vessels numbering eighty, they began landing in the southern part of the island. Japanese forces immediately engaged them. Fierce battles raged throughout the 16th, with continuous bloody fighting. However, the enemy on the island, disregarding the fierce fighting of the Japanese forces, did their utmost to secure a position in the southern part, with a force of about one division.</p>
<p>Central Pacific Base, 18th (Central News Agency dispatch) – In the Palau Islands area, 114 enemy fighter-bombers attacked on the 16th. Japanese forces shot down two of them. Also, in the Kendari area of Celebes Island, about 30 enemy aircraft attacked on the 16th.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to an Associated Press reporter at the Peleliu Island front on the 16th, the situation of the landing battle on the island is as follows: On the night of the 15th, Japanese forces attempted a night attack on the U.S. Marine Corps bridgehead, and part of them had entered the inner side of the U.S. left flank. Prior to the landing, the U.S. forces had carried out intense artillery fire, believing that there were few survivors among the Japanese forces on the island. However, after the landing, Japanese forces emerged from various places one after another and launched fierce attacks on the landing U.S. forces. By evening, Japanese forces even deployed tank units, and part of them broke through the U.S. lines. However, the U.S. forces were able to maintain the bridgehead. The U.S. forces attempted to advance to seize the island's airfield, but Japanese fire was intense, and the U.S. forces were unable to advance a single step, especially on a hill on the left flank, where Japanese forces appeared to be stationed. However, the U.S. forces did not launch a large-scale barrage on that area with large-caliber guns. U.S. tanks and other vehicles in that area were engulfed in flames, extremely intense. The power of Japanese mortars was truly frightening.</p>
<h3>Japanese Government Held Liaison and Informal Discussion Meeting, Strengthening the Structure of the Greater East Asia General Headquarters</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The liaison and informal discussion meeting between the Japanese government, the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, and the Imperial Rule Political Support Association was held at the Prime Minister's official residence on the morning of the 18th to respond to the national movement.

The councilors are Inshin Kazaki, Tasuke Sato, and Takayoshi Matsumuro.</p>
<h3>Sketches of Tokyo Under Intense War Situation</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) – As the war situation in Tokyo intensifies, Tokyo is currently striving to realize so-called armament, or to evacuate its large population to local areas, or to improve air defense facilities. All of these are sufficient to express the colors of a wartime capital. The recent situation and the Japanese people's determination to win are introduced as follows: The most reassuring thing for the citizens is to ensure their food supply, and the citizens know very well that there are several months' worth of</p>
<h3>Emergency Food Supplies</h3>
<p>Stored in safe places in the city. Even if there is an air raid, each citizen can be fed by the supply corps. The food supply is based on a rationing system, with each person receiving 330 grams of polished rice per day. Important workers receive 570 grams. Because the system is perfect, the rationing order is well-organized. Each month, the rationers deliver the food to the homes. Side dishes such as vegetables and fish are rationed every two or four days. Soy sauce, sugar, salt, and edible oils are all rationed according to the standard amount researched by the National Nutrition Department of the Ministry of Health and Welfare. According to a survey by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the</p>
<h3>National Constitution</h3>
<p>There has been no change before the incident. Although the average weight of infants in Osaka and Kyoto has decreased by 3%, there has been an increase of 15% in the northeast of the four countries compared with before the incident. Therefore, on the national average, the nutrition of the people has not decreased. In addition, each household can be rationed five bottles of wine or two bottles of beer per month. Milk for infants, cakes and milk oil for patients, etc. According to Japanese customs, appetite will inevitably increase in autumn. Therefore, Tokyo and other military cities have recently implemented a ration of two cans per person. The paper on the canned food is printed with the words "Made in Showa 15", so the general public believes that there are stocks from five years ago, so naturally there is no need to worry. Regarding Tokyo's</p>
<h3>Transportation Tram</h3>
<p>The number of passengers has increased significantly recently. All office workers are carrying a miscellaneous bag called "Hokobukuro", which is a new type of bag that is a compromise between a briefcase and a small cloth bag. It contains items such as gas masks, leggings, first-aid medicines, and bulletproof headscarves in case of an air raid. In addition, using this kind of bag, even in a crowded tram, you can hold the handrail with one hand and read the newspaper with the other, which is more convenient than a briefcase. In addition to civil servants, this type of bag is also used by workers, including women who work in service organizations and factories. The old-fashioned leather bags used by women are rarely seen, but only a small bag is hung outside the miscellaneous bag to hold lipstick. Regarding</p>
<h3>Publishing Business</h3>
<p>Recently, we have been trying our best to save paper, but scientific and technological publications that encourage national war will can still be published in quantities of 10,000 to 50,000 copies. Hundreds of books can be published every month, and there are often crowds in bookstores. From the first day of the month, newspapers will be changed to two large newspapers a week and four small newspapers on the remaining days. The editorial policy is to be concise and not to omit news. Every day after lunch, simple and clear songs are popular in various workplaces. In terms of sports, aviation exercises are popular, and painters can often be found visiting various factories. In terms of art, artists are also very active. The front line battlefields and military schools, factories, etc. can often be found. All works are collected in Tokyo. Afternoon</p>
<h3>Theater Cinema</h3>
<p>Whether large or small, they are extremely crowded. By evening, the most distinctive feature is the national bar, where drinkers often go to get drunk. Students wearing patriotic badges can often be seen in trams. These students are mostly workers in aircraft factories and radio wave weapons factories. The number of students in Tokyo ranks first in Japan, so the work efficiency of these students is also extremely impressive. The evacuation of elementary school students has now been largely completed, and there are few elementary school students on the streets. The ticket sellers on trams, the ticket windows and ticket gates of provincial trains, and the operation of large cargo trucks on the streets are all</p>
<h3>Women in Charge</h3>
<p>In addition, each state-owned railway is gradually switching to women. At the same time, women in uniforms can also be seen on cargo trucks flying on the streets. Zero-piece transporters. Therefore, the large-scale dispatch of these women has made a significant contribution to the increase in labor and military industrial production rates.</p>
<h3>Soviet Troops Protecting the Territory Enter Greek Territory, Battle for Riga Intensifies</h3>
<p>Belgrade, 18th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a German news agency report, a French dispatch from Stanford stated that Soviet troops have crossed the Greek-Bulgarian border and are advancing towards Dedeagach and Salonika.</p>
<p>Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a German news agency report, the Bauska district is the focal point of the large-scale offensive by Soviet troops on the northern front. Ten divisions of Soviet troops have arrived in Riga, attempting to isolate the German forces in Estonia. In the Modon area, approximately six Soviet divisions and several tank brigades launched a fierce attack on the 15th. After fierce tank battles against the German armored forces, they were eventually defeated. The fighting in the Volga region is also extremely fierce. Soviet troops attempted to break into German positions with fourteen infantry divisions and four tank units, but were repelled by German forces 20 kilometers west of Riga.</p>
<h3>German Troops Retreat from Entire Finnish Front</h3>
<p>Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a Reuters dispatch, German troops on the Kandalaksha front in Finland have completely retreated today after three years of defense. The reason is that Soviet troops wanted to encircle most of the German troops from the north, so they had to retreat completely. All military supplies were moved in a short period of time, and military equipment was destroyed or dismantled. However, a Soviet flanking team finally cut off one of the German troops' retreat routes, and fierce battles took place for several days on the Korja Highway north of Sala. German troops broke through on the 13th and reached the designated location. The evacuation operations on the Uhita and Rauhi fronts were carried out according to schedule, and German troops have now crossed the Finnish-Soviet border and are retreating westward.</p>
<h3>German and Finnish Troops Clash on Hogland Island</h3>
<p>Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a Reuters dispatch from responsible sources, when German troops advanced to Hogland Island in the Gulf of Finland on Friday, they clashed with Finnish defense forces on the island. According to the Finnish armistice agreement, the island should be transferred to the Soviets. However, in order to protect the interests of their country and Finland, and to establish a defensive line to protect Estonia, the German troops had no choice but to occupy it. Therefore, the attitude of the Finnish garrison on the island is particularly unfavorable to their country and the people of the Baltic states.</p>
<h3>U.S. Submarine Sinks Japanese Prisoner Ship</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency dispatch) – On the 7th of this month, a Japanese transport ship carrying 750 American prisoners of war was sailing in the Mindanao Sea when it was suddenly torpedoed by a U.S. submarine and sank immediately. All 750 American prisoners of war and the Japanese crew were drowned. Details will be announced after proper investigation. Also, on June 26, a Japanese prisoner transport ship was similarly sunk by a U.S. submarine in the Sumatra Sea. Out of 720 prisoners on board, only 180 were rescued.</p>
<h3>On the Shanghai-Nanjing Train</h3>
<p>— Min Xian</p>
<p>In order to understand the actual situation of all classes, the reporter did not use any help. He spent a lot of effort and was lucky enough to buy a third-class train ticket to Zhenjiang. It took three hours and I was covered in sweat. The so-called lucky thing is that I had lined up to the ticket window twice, and the full sign had been hung up just a few people away, but after the fact, there were still several short-sleeved, crooked-hats selling there. [Do you want the tickets for the day?] When asked about the fare, it was several times higher than the regular price. As for the procedure, the buyer must first hand over the citizen's certificate to be taken away. In just a few minutes, the ticket will be delivered, and the money and ticket will be cleared. The credit is full. How these brokers get the tickets, I think readers will not be difficult to understand!</p>
<p>The reporter finally got a ticket, and there was still difficulty when entering the gate. I was told by an experienced traveler that as long as I spent a little more money, I could pass unimpeded, but in order to reduce trouble, the reporter had to take out another kind of ID card, and finally passed through smoothly. After entering the gate, I lined up again, squeezing out a lot of sweat. The strangest thing is that the reporter was the twelfth person to enter the station to check tickets for third-class passengers, and when I rushed to the train, the passengers were almost full. At first, I thought it was second-class passengers who had no seats and came here to take a seat, but after inquiring one by one, they were all third-class passengers. They were able to enter first, I don't know what kind of magic is. In short, traveling now has a mysterious nature anytime and anywhere. When the car started, it was already crowded. Looking around, of course, most of them were single passengers, with bags on top and bags below, of different sizes and a variety of items. But looking at their packages and bags, it seems that they have exceeded 30 kilograms, and they can all be taken on the train. I don't know what kind of magical method there is? The various colors in the car are also worth recording, which are described as follows:</p>
<h3>The Center of the Topic</h3>
<p>Because everyone is squeezed like sardines, almost breathless, the only way to pass the time is to chat. The topic of conversation is almost focused on the soaring cost of living. From the soaring cost of living to the value of banknotes, some people talk about their own reasons for such a trend, so how can prices not rise day by day? I wonder what proper countermeasures the wise authorities have taken.</p>
<h3>The Plans of the Single Runner</h3>
<p>The topic turned to the single runner. The first speaker was a burly man from Jiangbei. He said that he had run dozens of trips and had never encountered bad luck, so he achieved this. There are no more than three kinds of skills, that is, first, you have to be able to endure, no matter how cold, hot, crowded, or hungry you have to endure. The second is to be willing to give up. When you encounter an unavoidable need, you have to be willing to give up and make friends. The third is to be ruthless, that is, you must sell the inferior goods at a high price and not talk about any personal feelings. When speaking, he looked proud, pointing to the three pairs of bulky cloth bags he was carrying, indicating that no one else could get on the train except him. This is his way of being willing to give up. Another middle-aged man who looked like a farmer said that although running solo is hard, it is much more painful than being subjected to all kinds of exploitation when farming at home. Now, although there are many expenses, the wool comes from the sheep, and I don’t feel heartache. Another middle-aged woman accompanied by a young girl said that they were aunt and sister-in-law, saying that her little girl originally wove cloth at home, but now she has run a few times with her, and it is much more promising than weaving cloth. This is why there are more and more single passengers.</p>
<h3>Reasonable Illegal</h3>
<p>While talking, it suddenly became quiet, and it turned out that three friends in uniform had already walked into the car to conduct a random check. Those who are determined to run solo have already negotiated a compromise, with a knowing smile on their faces. Those who are new to the game will inevitably struggle a little more, and they will still have some subtle relationships and let them go safely. Among them, there was an old man who refused to spend the standard amount, so he forcibly took away three packs of cigarettes. Afterwards, someone came to mediate, saying that they had a certain sense of proportion when it came to asking for money, and they would never hurt your old capital with reasonable estimates, and they would only spend once at a time and would not come to bother you again, so it is better to be sensible. When the car passed Changzhou, I saw the old man take back the cigarettes and get off the train, and I must have made an explanation. Is this the so-called robbers also have principles?</p>
<h3>As Black as Crows</h3>
<p>Finally arrived in Zhenjiang, the reporter got rid of the sardine-like squeeze, and his mind was refreshed. When walking through the inspection place, I saw several solo guests giving cigarettes, towels, etc. to the inspection comrades, and some also gave substitutes, as if they were familiar friends. Probably the inspection comrades asked them to buy them on their behalf, or returned the money because the items they bought on their behalf were not purchased! What else can I say!</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Occupy Zhaoqing City, Fierce Fighting Continues, U.S. Air Force in Guilin Begins to Withdraw</h3>
<p>A certain base on the South China Front, 18th (Central News Agency dispatch) – A part of the Japanese troops in the Xijiang area attacked and entered Zhaoqing City, a stronghold of the 36th Group Army of the Yu (Chongqing) on the 16th, and fierce fighting is still continuing in the city.</p>

<h3>Guilin Airfields All Destroyed</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency dispatch) – As the Japanese army in the Xiang-Gui provinces actively pressed on Guilin from both sides, Guilin, the central base of the U.S. 14th Air Force of the Yu (Chongqing), has now lost its strategic value, so the U.S. military of the Yu has begun to destroy it. Regarding this, according to an Associated Press reporter at the U.S. 14th Air Force headquarters on the 17th, the Japanese army attacked from both sides of the Xiang-Gui Railway and northern Guangdong. Therefore, the U.S. military in Guilin, the hub of the air base, has been completely evacuated. All facilities and warehouses, weapons, ammunition, and fuel at the Guilin airfield, except for a small glider runway used by fighter planes, have been destroyed. The Guilin base, which was painstakingly built by the 14th U.S. Air Force two years ago, has now been completely destroyed.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Japanese Army Attacks Huaiji County to the West</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency dispatch) – A United Press correspondent stationed in Yu (Chongqing) recently reported on the battle situation of the Japanese army's attack on Guilin, saying that in order to respond to the operations south along the Xiang-Gui Railway, the Japanese army has started operations from the northwestern part of Guangdong Province, and is now attacking westward along the Suijiang River with four teams. One team of Japanese troops has now broken through the provincial border, entered Guangxi Province, and is attacking Huaiji County. According to the Associated Press, four teams of Japanese troops attacked from Guangdong Province and have now forced the gap between the east and west of the Chinese mainland to be compressed to 190 kilometers. According to Reuters, the battle for Guilin has now begun, and the Yu army's camp is very chaotic. Guangzhou, 18th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a Chongqing dispatch, after the Japanese army captured the entire county, it has now reached a location 46 kilometers away from Guilin.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Breaks into Sihui County Seat</h3>
<p>South China Front, 18th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The elite troops of the Japanese army in South China, gathered on the right bank of the Beijiang River, began to move on the morning of the 9th, attacking along the Siqing Highway. Overcoming all difficulties, they continued to attack with unstoppable force. On the 11th, they broke into the Sihui County seat, an important town on the north bank of the Suijiang River, and are now continuing to expand the results of the battle.</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Attack Liuzhou Airfield Again</h3>
<p>Mainland Base, 18th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The elite Japanese aircraft launched a strong attack on the Yu army base in Liuzhou at dawn on the 17th, bombing the bunker area of its airfield amidst intense anti-aircraft fire. Two of them were hit and caught fire, and all Japanese aircraft returned safely. Due to the continuous strong attacks by Japanese aircraft in recent days, the Yu (Chongqing) and U.S. aircraft have lost the room to move, and even at night, the Yu and U.S. aircraft are completely silent.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Crossing the River Occupy Yueqing</h3>
<p>Zhejiang Southern Front Base, 18th (Central News Agency dispatch) – After the Japanese army entered Wenzhou County on the 9th, they decided to cross the Zhenjiang River under the fierce bombing of the U.S. Air Force on the 10th and 11th. On the morning of the 12th, they began to attack along the Oujiang River, and occupied Yueqing County on the afternoon of the same day.

<h3>Chongqing Political Council Dissatisfied with Chongqing's Administration; Difficult to Achieve Unity Due to Conflict Between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch: The evolution of the Chongqing-Communist conflict will have implications for various international frictions. Currently, the United States and the United Kingdom, in the ongoing war against Japan, are utilizing Chongqing's strength to fight the Japanese army on the Chinese mainland. They also need the strength of the Chinese Communist Party to restrain and monitor the Japanese army. Therefore, the United States and the United Kingdom hope for unity between Chongqing and the Communist Party, as it would benefit them. However, the Soviet Union does not think so. The Soviet Union uses the Chinese Communist Party's strength to monitor the United States, the United Kingdom, and Chongqing and has no desire for the United States and the United Kingdom to control Chinese power. Therefore, while the United States and the United Kingdom hope for unity between Chongqing and the Communist Party, the Soviet Union is intensifying its efforts to obstruct this, taking advantage of the weaknesses of the United States and the United Kingdom. As a result, it is very difficult to achieve unity between Chongqing and the Communist Party, which is akin to sleeping in the same bed but dreaming different dreams. The inside story of the Chongqing-Communist conflict, such as the forced statement by Chongqing's propaganda minister Liang Han-tsao, takes various forms. Instigated by behind-the-scenes figures on both sides, the situation is only escalating. According to news obtained from relevant sources in this city, there is considerable detail regarding the Chinese Communist Party's attacks on Chongqing. The situation of the Chongqing National Political Council is described below:</p>
<h3>Conflicting Views Between Chongqing and the Communist Party</h3>
<p>○ It is reported that on the morning of the 5th of this month, the first day of the Chongqing National Political Council's opening in Chongqing, Chiang Kai-shek also attended and presided over the meeting. The Communist Party, however, was very dissatisfied with Chiang's personal presiding and strongly criticized it. According to the Communist Party's opinion, the serious situation on the current Chinese battlefield is being ignored. Only empty words are used to cover it up (because Chongqing Chiang's speech was lengthy), which will blur the people's vigilance, relax the people's will to resist Japan, and numb the people's [resistance] mobilization. In particular, Chongqing Chiang's statement that today's [resistance] is also for the unity of the country, etc. Therefore, the Communist Party's political views on Chongqing, namely unifying the Kuomintang, i.e., unifying dictatorial politics, are in complete opposition to the national public's theory of unifying a free, living, independent, and democratic country. Therefore, this situation is sufficient to show Chongqing Chiang's deeply rooted dictatorial prejudice and strongly suggests a threat of preparing for civil war. Therefore, Chiang's speech has aroused unfavorable reactions from the councilors. On behalf of the entire body, Councilor Lin Hu delivered a reply, expressing deep dissatisfaction and demanding the elimination and reform of real malpractices. According to Lin, when we look back at the national system and look forward to the future, we not only do not feel optimistic, but we are also full of apprehension. In this critical moment of survival, if we strive to invigorate ourselves and eliminate accumulated malpractices, then there will be a turning point and new life. Otherwise, the future is unimaginable.</p>
<h3>Unanimous Dissatisfaction with Government Policies</h3>
<p>○ The session of the Chongqing Political Council lasted for seven days, from the 1st to the 7th, during which the various ministries and departments of the government presented their policy reports. However, the questions raised by the councilors, as reported daily by Chongqing's Central News Agency and United Press, only mentioned routine trivial matters, including reports from the ten departments of military affairs, politics, foreign affairs, economy, finance, food administration, social affairs, internal affairs, education, transportation, justice, and administration. Therefore, the nationwide public demand for reform is at its most critical and dangerous state, yet the Chongqing regime shows no sign of reflection. Taking only the report of He Yingqin, the Minister of Military Affairs, as an example, at a time when Chongqing and the public were unanimously angered by the defeat in the Hunan-Guangxi campaign, he still tried to deceive himself and justify his actions. According to He, the Chongqing army in each battlefield is both attacking and defending, inflicting significant losses on the enemy at any time. And the report of Yu Hongjun, the Vice Minister of Finance, did not mention a word about rampant corruption and the impending financial bankruptcy. It only stated that the financial system focuses on the collection and purchase of land tax, striving to achieve fairness and no abuse, and convenience for the people, etc. Therefore, this report aroused dissatisfaction from the Political Council. Councilor Zhou Binglin demanded that the heads of the various ministries and departments pay attention to policy matters. As a result, all 120 attending councilors stood up and requested that the two departments of finance and military affairs request the government to improve the treatment of soldiers and public school staff and submit concrete measures for discussion at the meeting. At the same time, the council members vehemently criticized the government's corruption. One councilor even stated that high-ranking officials and generous salaries could be obtained in the government through personal connections. Looking at the bribery cases in the organizations, such as the person responsible for collecting goods in kind, officials in various places are actually extorting, causing undue suffering to the peasants. In addition, Councilor Guo Zhonggui from Henan gave a vivid report to the conference on what he had seen and heard in Henan, regarding the extraordinary anger caused by the Chongqing army's collapse without a fight on the two battlefields in Henan. After the report of Gu Zhenggang, the Minister of Social Affairs, Councilor Zhou Binglin reported on the deaths he had seen on the streets in Kunming, believing that the most needed sympathy in social relief work has now disappeared. At the same time, Councilor Jiang Yiping asked whether the Ministry of Social Affairs could eliminate social ills. In addition, Huang Yanpei, Wang Yunwu, Zuo Shunsheng, Wang Liming and others raised questions about the protection of personal freedom. In short, in the policy reports of various departments of the Chongqing regime and the questions raised by the councilors, the Kuomintang attempted to cover up the unprecedented crisis on the surface and maintained its dictatorial and isolated political system of rule. At the same time, it also partially reflects the intense anger of the people nationwide and within the Kuomintang against the ruling Kuomintang.</p>
<h3>Inspecting Newspapers and Suppressing Public Opinion</h3>
<p>○ The editorial of the Liberation Daily on the 12th of this month [After Freedom of Speech] attacked Chongqing's freedom of speech issue. In April of this year, Liang Hancao, Chongqing's Propaganda Minister, made a statement to Chinese and foreign reporters, admitting that the Kuomintang's censorship system had shortcomings, even errors, in technology. He also announced a relaxation of standards. In May, the Kuomintang's Twelfth Plenary Session of the Central Committee announced that fair public opinion should expose malpractices and convey public grievances, and passed a case to improve the key points of publication inspection, partially abolishing prior submission for inspection. In June, the censorship measures and prohibited standards, and wooden board censorship rules were published. According to the Kuomintang's announced interpretation of prohibited content, the main content of these regulations is that magazines not aimed at discussing military, political, and diplomatic affairs are to be self-censored by the author and publisher, who remain legally responsible. They can still be banned after publication. The important prohibited standards include: First, interpretations that violate the highest principles of legislation, that provoke unity among ethnic groups, that promote aggression, that promote fascism, or theories of class dictatorship, that promote personal slander, that endanger the state, and that disrupt public order. Second, those that harm the friendship between our country and friendly countries or the unity of allied countries, etc. The various measures that have been stipulated in the interpretation have many drawbacks in the regulations themselves, which can be said to be an expression of the Kuomintang's dictatorship. For example, among the daily newspapers published, in May, a total of 33 editorials, foreign reports, and news items were not published or were deleted, including 12 that advocated democracy and unity, and the rest included various parties, etc. In addition, the speech essay delivered by Sun Ke, the President of Chongqing's Legislative Yuan, at the National Central Training Corps, was also not published. Furthermore, the American reporter's criticism of Lin Yutang's remarks on the 15th of this month was absurd, and the foreign news report was also not published. With such a serious situation, how can one speak of freedom of speech?</p>
<h3>Kong's Comments Show Insufficient Understanding</h3>
<p>○ Kong Xiangxi's remarks at the Washington Club in the United States on the 10th of this month, which severely criticized the Chinese Communist Party, completely lacked an understanding of the current situation. On military matters, Kong said that China had never diverted American supplies for purposes other than fighting Japan, and that American lend-lease supplies armed the best units of the Kuomintang. We can see the extent of Kong's lies by looking at the border areas imprisoned in the [anti-Japanese] democratic base areas. Kong then said that when it comes to the effectiveness of the Chongqing army's armed operations, the Chongqing army has artillery tanks, and their combat spirit is no less than that of any country's army. Therefore, Kong's bold lies are directly contrary to the facts. Furthermore, considering the overall policies of Chongqing in politics and economics, even with any number of artillery and tanks, it is difficult to improve the Chongqing army's combat capabilities. In terms of Kong's political remarks, some people believe that China is not a democratic country, but Chongqing has decided to convene a National Assembly within one year after the end of the war to formulate a constitution. He also said that the Chongqing regime is determined to fulfill this promise. Regarding the economy, Kong said that the degree of controlling inflation can be adopted to obtain a higher evaluation. However, Kong has forgotten his statement on July 4, in which he said that the budget in the Great Rear Area in 1944 showed that tax revenue accounted for 52 percent, but it is still doubtful whether this tax revenue standard can be achieved. Therefore, Kong went on to say that he had to rely heavily on bank loans, which would inevitably increase purchasing power and promote rising prices. Therefore, the price index in Chongqing last month exceeded two to three times the level of February to June of this year, and the price of food increased by more than 1,200 times. Therefore, Kong's statement that the Chongqing regime has failed to unify opinions on military, political, and social matters and has suffered damage is a repetition of the isolated unification theory in Congress.</p>
<h3>British and American Parachute Troops Land in the Netherlands; German Troops Encircle and Annihilate Most of Them</h3>
<p>Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - German News Agency: In the past few days, the anti-Axis forces attempted to break through the German defensive positions near the mouth of the Scheldt River and the Meuse River without success. Then, on Sunday afternoon, British and American forces used strong air transport troops to land in the areas of Tilburg, Eindhoven, and Nijmegen in southern Holland (near the German border south of the Rhine River). The German army immediately attacked the landed enemy units. Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - German News Agency: The British and American air transport troops who landed on the north bank of the Rhine River west of the German-Dutch border on Sunday afternoon, protected by a large air force, have suffered heavy losses. After the paratroopers landed, they were followed by the landing of many cargo gliders. The German army in the area immediately engaged the enemy, surrounded the landed enemy troops, and annihilated most of them.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battle in the Nancy Area of France</h3>
<p>Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - German News Agency: Fierce fighting took place yesterday on both sides of Nancy in southeastern France. At that time, the German counterattack broke through the northern side of the enemy penetration area. East of Nancy, the American army surrounded the town from the southeast with a larger force, where fierce fighting is taking place. The French Second Tank Division advanced towards Epinal, suffered heavy losses in the German counterattack, and was unable to continue its advance. West of Epinal, Germany stopped the enemy's advance at the Treres Canal.</p>
<h3>Finnish Prime Minister Dies, to be Succeeded by Kastimurun</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 18th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Finnish Prime Minister Haekziel recently died of cerebral hemorrhage. It is reported that Kastimurun, the president of the Supreme Court, was appointed as Prime Minister on the 18th.</p>
<h3>Returning from the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Achievements of the Five-Year Plan The work of evacuating these facilities was extremely difficult. It would not be surprising to use trains to load them, and it would not be enough to load them for several months. Some of them arrived early, while others did not arrive for several months. When the train finally reached its destination, there was no place to load and unload the goods, and there were no homes for the workers. There were many such situations. And these were all encounters in the severe cold of Siberia. This is from another Soviet newspaper. It can be seen that before they were installed in the interior, they had already taken extraordinary efforts. By the end of 1942, the second year of the war, these factories relocated to the interior had been largely installed and began operating. The production capacity of aircraft, artillery, tanks, etc., had by then returned to its pre-evacuation level. The Eastern region had already made considerable achievements in three five-year plan constructions before the war. Therefore, the evacuated equipment utilized the existing buildings and equipment in the area, and with some additional facilities, the evacuated equipment and personnel could begin to operate.</p>
<p>The Iron Will The German-Soviet war, which lasted for three years and two months, gave Stalin an opportunity to dedicate himself to the cause. When it came to a time of crisis, one could not help but bring out all one's strength to cope, and this was true for both individuals and nations. Stalin's politics are one of the types of dictatorial politics. During the development of the Soviet Union in this war, when it came to a matter of life and death, his iron will and unwavering belief, along with his tenacity and domineering personality, were clearly displayed to people all over the world. In the summer of 1941, when the German army approached the surroundings of Leningrad, Stalin repeatedly ordered that the cradle of the revolution, the city of Leningrad, be defended to the death. The Red Army and citizens defending the area did not abandon the last line of defense, even though bodies piled up like mountains. However, the Moscow defense war must be said to be the most severe test of Stalin's iron will. The German army, which had been advancing rapidly from the Smolensk area directly towards the capital, dispersed the Red Army guarding Moscow. Just as the German army's vanguard, with the rapid force of tanks and mechanized units, was about to break into Moscow in one fell swoop, the situation was extremely urgent. The government agencies in the administrative and diplomatic departments all left the capital. On the anniversary of the revolution on November 7 of the same year, the leaders of the party, such as Kalinin, Voroshilov, Andreyev, Shvernik, and Voznesensky, appeared in Kuibyshev. At that time, the people of Moscow were filled with despair. The Soviet Union's allied nations, the United Kingdom and the United States, were disappointed with the Red Army and revealed an intention to abandon Russia. At this time, was it not due to Stalin's iron will and undefeated belief that the German army's advance was stopped, and the situation was finally reversed? He ordered the government agencies, the party leaders, and the citizens to evacuate from the capital. He himself, along with Molotov and many others, stayed in the air-raid shelter of the Kremlin, picked up the telephone, and encouraged and motivated the Red Army soldiers who were fighting hard on the line dozens of kilometers outside Moscow. The Soviet newspapers have detailed the situation at the time. Stalin, who had repeatedly wandered in the alley of life and death to train himself, had an iron will and an undefeated belief, even in the face of crisis, as the Soviet newspapers said, as unshakable as a mountain.</p>
<p>The Supreme Order to Regard Death as Home The so-called Stalinist tactics, which revealed their full picture in this war, were very simple in content. Russia's defensive warfare has been known for its retreat tactics since ancient times. As early as 521 BC, the Scythians skillfully led the invading army of the Persian King Darius into the interior of Russia and defeated the superior Persian army, so it is also called the Scythian tactic. During the Napoleonic Wars in 1812, commanders Barclay and Kutuzov, etc., clearly used this Scythian tactic to trap Napoleon. In this German-Soviet war, many military commentators have equated Stalin's tactics with the Scythian [retreat tactics], but I do not agree. I believe that Supreme Commander Stalin did not adopt a planned retreat operation like Commander-in-Chief Barclay and Kutuzov after him. A public lecture recently held in Moscow further proves my view. During the defensive war stage in the first half of the war, Stalin was always an advocate of resistance. Do not give an inch to the enemy! Do not abandon an inch of land to the enemy! Stop the enemy's advance with death! Resist to the end in this position! Resist! This was the highest order he often gave to the soldiers on the front line. Even areas or locations of little or no value from a general tactical theory perspective were defended to the death at the cost of human lives. When the German army had reached the banks of the Volga River, Volga traffic was cut off, and the main part of Stalingrad had fallen into the hands of the German army, Stalin's tactics were fully utilized in sacrificing so much to defend a corner of Stalingrad. Because the mountain of corpses was built, the German tank mechanized units could not move forward a single step. At this time, the Soviet Union's national mobilization progressed, the training of the mobilized troops also came to an end, and the productivity of the Urals, Siberia, Central Asia, and the interior of Russia was also expanded. Moreover, with the remaining time, the resources, both material and human, of the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, and other allied countries were also mobilized and turned into combat power. Prior to that, resistance was necessary, that's what Stalin thought. (End) (Xiang: Translated from the Asahi Shimbun, August 26)</p>

<h3>Municipal Advisory Committee Hosts Leaders of Japanese Residents to Exchange Opinions on Establishing Security and Improving People's Livelihood</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 18th) at 4 PM, the Municipal Advisory Committee hosted a tea party in the Municipal Government Conference Room for the leaders of the Allied Residents Group, industry and commerce, banking, and newspapers in this city to exchange opinions on improving municipal administration. More than 30 people attended, including Yasui Gengo, Mimura Masataka, Funatsu Tatsuichiro, Aoki Setsu, Kurimoto Toraji, Osaka Yoichi, and Yoshida Tosuke. Secretary-General Wu of the Municipal Government was also invited to participate and was hosted by Executive Committee members Li Sihao, Lin Kanghou, Chen Riping, Chen Binhe, Xiang Kangyuan, and Shen Siliang of the Advisory Committee.</p>
<h3>Welcome Speech</h3>
<p>First, Li Sihao delivered a welcome speech, saying: Gentlemen, thank you very much for attending the second gathering of our association today. We feel that the current situation is becoming increasingly serious, and Shanghai's position is important. We should make our greatest contribution to the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, not only should the municipal authorities and the citizens cooperate closely, but we also hope that the Japanese authorities, Japanese residents, Chinese municipal authorities, and Chinese citizens will cooperate closely to create great power. I believe that the most serious issues in Shanghai at present that should be resolved first are the establishment of security and the improvement of people's livelihood. Without the establishment of security, it is not easy to implement any administrative plans. Without the improvement of people's livelihood, it is not easy for any cooperation to take effect. Regarding these two points, I would like to ask for the high opinions of all the leaders. Subsequently, Yasui, Aoki, Funatsu, Osaka, Yoshida, Mimura, and others successively expressed their opinions, which generally emphasized: ○ In wartime construction of Greater Shanghai, officials and people must work hard together. ○ Efforts should be made to improve the treatment of security team police and pay attention to their spiritual training. ○ Strengthen the Baojia self-defense and give play to the self-defense power of the people. ○ Officials and people should unanimously promote social economy and be serious about private life, etc. The atmosphere was very warm, and the meeting did not end until 6:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Inland Waterway Routes in Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou Have Been Completely Suspended Since Yesterday; Zhejiang Provincial Government is Preparing Remedial Measures</h3>
<p>In view of the frequent obstructions on the Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou routes, the Shanghai Inland Waterway Shipping Company has suspended the routes starting today for the sake of passenger safety. However, the suspended routes are all separated from the railway. All transportation originally relied on waterways, which has a great impact on people's livelihood. It has already been reported to the Ministry of Construction, which has transferred it to the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, instructing the counties along the route to quickly prepare proper measures to facilitate the resumption of navigation. It is now learned that the Zhejiang Provincial Government has approved the Ministry's transfer of instructions to the counties along the route, requesting a report on remedial measures. The names of the suspended routes are listed below: ○ Shanghai to Hangzhou Line, ○ Tangxi to Xinshi Line, ○ Hangzhou to Huzhou Line, ○ Shanghai to Huzhou Line, ○ Huzhou to Suzhou Line, ○ Jiaxing to Xiashi Line, ○ Jiaxing to Haiyan Line, ○ Jiaxing to Tongxiang Line, ○ Pinghu to Zhapu Line, ○ Shanghai to Pinghu Line, ○○ Shanghai to Lili Line, ○○ Nantong to Haian Line.</p>
<h3>Baojia Fees for September and October Will Be Collected Together</h3>
<p>Since the Baojia in this city were unified, Baojia expenses are also collected uniformly, starting in July. It was previously agreed that the Baojia fees for July and August would be collected on August 15 and end at the end of August. The end date has now passed, and the collection matters in various districts have also been completed. The Baojia Office has specifically instructed the general joint Bao offices and police sub-bureaus in various districts that all report forms and funds to be submitted must be reported and submitted to the office by today (the 19th) for verification. Those who still lack application forms can quickly obtain them from the office. The future collection decision is to start on the 1st of each month and end on the 7th. Those who are unable to handle the matter in September should urgently handle it and temporarily delay the issuance. Each district should pay close attention to this point. The notes for filling out the forms are recorded below: ○ Type 5 form and Jia-chief! Type 5 forms are prescribed for use at all levels. However, the reports of the Jia-chiefs for July and August must be concluded in the last item of Type 1 forms to make the total number clear. There is no need to fill out Type 5 forms again to save procedures and paper. Those that have already been filled out are convenient. Check that for each report after that, the Jia-chief does not need to fill in much information, so the office will shorten Type 5 forms and print [New Type 5] for the Jia-chiefs to use, and the content is exactly the same. ○ Overdue fee form - Check the collection results reported by each district, there is no case of overdue fees, so Types 4, 5, and 6 are temporarily proposed to be printed later to save paper. If there are a few households with overdue fees, each level should draw and use the form itself.</p>
<h3>Japanese Embassy Office Held Regular Reporting Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>The regular reporting meeting hosted by the Shanghai Office of the Allied Japanese Embassy was held at 2:30 PM yesterday (the 18th) on the 8th floor of the Huaxiang Hotel on the Bund of Nanjing Road. Information Minister Matsudaira returned to his country due to official business, and Vice Consul Fukuma attended on his behalf to meet with Chinese newspaper reporters in this city. Mr. Fukuma gave a detailed account of the recent international situation on the spot, which lasted for two and a half hours before the meeting ended.</p>
<h3>French Tram Company Complies with the Order to Restore the Original Price</h3>
<p>To be Implemented Starting Today The French tram company in this city suddenly increased its prices without authorization from the 15th, increasing the price by half of the original price, causing public outrage and demanding strict prohibition. The Municipal Public Works Bureau also considered that the company's price increase was illegal and ordered it to stop increasing the price and immediately restore the original price in order to maintain the law. It is now learned that the company has agreed to comply with the order and restore the original price starting today (the 19th) to avoid punishment.</p>
<h3>Economy Association Suggests Stopping the Publication of Gambling Place Advertisements; Publicity Office Adopts and Implements</h3>
<p>Publicity Office Adopts and Implements The Shanghai Special City Economy Association, in view of the fact that the Greater East Asia War has laid the foundation for decisive victory, has been promoting economy in various ways, hoping that the actions of the rear people will meet the needs of the soldiers on the front line, complete Sino-Japanese cooperation, and build the mission of the co-prosperity sphere. The association also considered that some newspapers in Shanghai used valuable space to publish useless advertisements and improper texts, so they sent a public letter to the Municipal Publicity Office yesterday with suggestions. The original text is extracted below: (Omitted above) Gambling places that publish advertisements in newspapers to attract gamblers should be prohibited first. It has been found that the major newspapers in this city have complied with the resolution of the Shanghai News Joint Association and automatically stopped publishing such advertisements since July 1 of this year. However, some small newspapers still publish advertisements for Jai Alai venues and dog racing venues, which are disguised gambling venues, attracting customers. In particular, the Fan Hua Bao is the worst. In addition to the advertisements, it also has a fixed position to publish Jai Alai articles, such as [Daily Ball Affairs] and [Win or Loss Predictions] and [Win or Loss Statistics] and other texts to encourage gambling. If it is not ordered to stop the war, the harm will be even greater. The association is committed to economy and concerned about the difficulties of the times, and does not dare to remain silent. Moreover, as the situation becomes increasingly serious, as a participating country, it should strive to improve itself, and newspaper publishers should be more self-disciplined, publish more national current affairs in useful space to enhance the people's understanding and belief in the current situation, which is in line with the mission of wartime reporting institutions. The association requests the Publicity Office to order the small newspapers to stop publishing the advertisements and their articles from today, hoping that the flow of poison will gradually clear, the gambling wind will slightly subside, and then seek its extinction, so the country will be fortunate. (Omitted below) It is firmly believed that the authorities of the Municipal Publicity Office will adopt and implement it.</p>
<h3>Silver and Money Businesses Increase Deposit Interest Rates</h3>
<p>The silver and money businesses in this city have inevitably been manipulated by speculative hoarders due to rising prices in recent years, greatly affecting industrial and commercial economies. The business operations of silver and money businesses themselves have also been adversely affected. It is now understood that in order to attract deposits and prevent speculators from using funds for hoarding, and to maintain their legitimate business, various businesses have slightly increased the interest rates on interbank deposits and loans. In addition, the interest rate on customer's current deposits has been increased by 50%. The minimum interest rate on mortgage loans is six cents, and the maximum is one dime and four cents, with the general rate being around one dime. However, the collateral and the purpose of the loan still need to be carefully handled. It is believed that speculative hoarders may gradually disappear. It is internally decided that retail sugar outlets throughout the city will uniformly begin selling from the 21st of this month.</p>
<h3>The Situation of Soybeans Being Moved into Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Toraji Kurimoto</p>
<p>It has been half a month since the Oil and Grain Control Committee took over the miscellaneous grain movement permit affairs from the Commerce Control Committee. In these two weeks (the actual number of days for processing permit affairs was only eleven), the number of soybean movement permit applications from the industry was approximately over one thousand tons, averaging about one hundred tons per day. The production areas are all in the Jiangnan region. The soybean harvest this year is very promising, so the market situation will gradually become more active. Therefore, the permit applications received to date are only a prelude. When comparing the market prices in the production areas with the market prices in Shanghai, the industry feels that there is considerable profit to be made, so they are applying to move soybeans in. This kind of material circulation is a good phenomenon when viewed from the current economic situation in Shanghai and the surrounding rural areas. Furthermore, once these soybeans are moved into Shanghai, it is unlikely that they will flow out to other ports again, unless there are special circumstances. Most of them are used as supplementary food for the four million citizens of Shanghai. Currently, the daily consumption of soybeans in Shanghai, excluding soy sauce making, is approximately 40 tons. As for the consumption of oil mills, each oil mill has stopped working due to insufficient power, so consumption in that area is not a problem. As for soy sauce brewing, it depends on the season and still needs to be delayed slightly. Needless to say, most of these soybeans are for citizen consumption, so the amount of import permit applications is just enough to supply the citizens for 25 days. And these applied-for soybean imports will arrive as early as mid-month and no later than early October. Moreover, now is the initial stage of the market, as long as the market price meets the industry's plans, the amount moved in will increase rapidly, so Shanghai will definitely not have a shortage of soybeans. However, what should be considered is that the purchasing funds for these soybeans are entirely the industry's own funds, and there is no other special financing. As for how much quantity the industry can move in with its own funds, this can only be revealed in future practice. However, if the industry's funds are unstable, in order to speed up the turnover of funds, goods will inevitably be gradually released to the market. And if the industry has considerable profit to make, it will not hoard them and prefer to keep the funds stagnant. Therefore, it will inevitably find ways to accelerate the turnover of funds. If the turnover slightly improves, the flow of introduced materials and the turnover of funds will naturally clarify the industry and the market. The demand side will also be relieved. The supply side will also not be unreasonable. It will become a great force in promoting the normalization of the overall economy. Since soybeans do not require special financing and there is no flooding of funds, this point can also be said to be very meaningful in terms of financial policy. It has been more than a year since China automatically participated in the Greater East Asia War, and the war situation will reach a severe decisive stage. The editorial of Shen Bao emphasized a few days ago [putting the public before the private], and our industry must also adhere to it. The Oil and Grain Control Committee also often hopes that the industry will [put the public before the private] in the disposal of relevant materials, respect the interests of the industry, seek preferential treatment for producers, and promote business with the greatest goals of stabilizing people's livelihoods and enhancing combat power. In this sense, one of its policies is to repeatedly disclose the actual situation of various items as soon as possible within the possible range using the data of the Oil Control Committee, in order to seek cooperation from the industry and provide reference for the general public.</p>
<h3>Price Stabilization Subcommittee Holds First Meeting</h3>
<p>Economic Bureau Secretly Investigates Illegal Price Increases</p>
<p>The Price Stabilization Subcommittee of the Municipal Economic Bureau held its first meeting at the bureau's conference room yesterday (18th) afternoon at 3 o'clock. Attendees included the Director of the Aquatic Products Administration. During the meeting, various plans on how to stabilize prices in the city and stabilize people's livelihoods were discussed in detail, and the meeting ended at around 5 o'clock. Recently, the price problem in the city has been serious, due to the secret price increases by illegal merchants in various industries. In some cases, the industry associations have even approved these increases, which is completely wrong. This not only affects people's livelihoods, but also violates government regulations. It is reported that the authorities concerned with economic relations are secretly investigating these illegal price increases by members of industry associations. If found, they will be severely punished.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry Strictly Prohibits Businesses from Using Company Names Without Authorization</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Industry considers companies to be legal entities, and they cannot be established without the permission and registration of the competent authority where the main store is located. This is explicitly stipulated in Articles 3 and 5 of the Company Law. Therefore, all sole proprietorships or partnerships, as well as companies that have not been legally registered, must not use company names. The ministry has recently received reports of non-corporate organizations using the word "company," which clearly violates the law and should be strictly prohibited to ensure compliance with the facts. It has been communicated to the provincial and municipal governments to instruct their subordinate competent authorities to comply accordingly. Businesses in this city should pay close attention.</p>
<h3>The 15th Phase of Rationed Sugar to Be Sold Regularly</h3>

<h3>The Educational Character of the Former Shanghai Municipal Council Chinese Children's Schools</h3>
<p>— Taichu Ueno</p>
<p>○ The Superiority of Treatment The superior treatment of teachers and staff at the former Shanghai Municipal Council schools seems to be generally recognized by the public. However, it is essential to know the extent of this superiority. In fact, such treatment is the standard that advanced countries in the world offer to public servants. However, China's administration of personnel is still in its infancy, making the difference apparent. As for the disparity in treatment between Chinese and Western personnel, even within the same institution and holding the same position, the difference can be several times greater. Thus, when speaking of superior treatment, it should refer to Westerners, with the Chinese being merely subordinate. A brief description of the treatment of Chinese personnel is as follows: Teaching staff are divided into two categories: those with contracts and those without. Higher-ranking staff have contracts, and their treatment is detailed in the contracts, with slight variations, reaching over a hundred items. Due to space limitations, only a general overview can be given.</p>
<p>One. Stability of Work The stability of life for teachers and staff at the former Chinese Children's Schools was most evident. As long as there were no major mistakes, the school never dismissed or failed to rehire teachers. Regardless of changes in directors or principals, it never affected the work of the teachers. Therefore, there were often interesting stories of teachers and students working together or fathers and sons working in the same position. There were also instances of people teaching at the same school for their entire lives, dying in their positions. There were many old men with beards at the Chinese Public School, who had dedicated decades of their lives to their alma mater and had thousands of students under their tutelage.</p>
<p>Two. Standards of Basic Salary The ranking of teachers and staff was determined by their academic qualifications. Generally speaking, the salary of a first-class middle school teacher was roughly equivalent to that of a professor at a national university. Second and third-class teachers also received salaries that were at least 30% higher than those of provincial middle school teachers. As for primary school teachers, their salaries were not significantly lower than those of middle school teachers, and their ranking and salary standards were also determined by their qualifications. (Note 5)</p>
<p>Three. Annual Increments Teachers and staff received annual increments on a specific date each year. Usually, there was a salary increase once every full year. Senior teachers also received increases every three years, depending on their signed contracts. The amount of each increment was divided into three categories: highest, middle, and lowest. The average was roughly equivalent to the total salary standard, generally determined by work performance. However, in fact, the word "[year]" in "annual increment" was particularly emphasized, so there were rarely instances of adding the minimum increment during salary increases.</p>
<p>Four. Various Benefits Besides Salary. (Note 7)</p>
<p>A. Retirement Savings 5% of the basic salary was deducted monthly as retirement savings. In addition, the Shanghai Municipal Council subsidized twice the amount of the savings, combined with the principal and interest. The interest rate was approximately 6% per annum, depending on the financial situation of the Shanghai Municipal Council. The total amount of principal and interest in the savings was reported separately in writing to each teacher by the finance department in early October each year, and it was stated that the individual could check the accounts at any time.</p>
<p>B. Retirement Pay If a teacher or staff member had served in a council-run school for more than 20 years and was approved by the head of the supervisory authority, they were entitled to 5% of the total annual salary of that year, multiplied by the number of years of service as retirement pay. This amount was also considerable.</p>
<p>C. Death, Illness, and Disability Benefits For those who became ill or disabled, after verification by the Shanghai Municipal Council Medical Committee, they were allowed to retire and could be given benefits equal to those of death benefits. The calculation method for the benefits was the same as for retirement pay, but it was not necessary to have served for more than 20 years. In addition, in the event of death, the Bureau subsidized the deceased's family with a considerable amount of funeral expenses.</p>
<p>D. Medical Treatment This point varied depending on the rank of the teacher and the provisions of the contract. The main points were:</p>
<p>Child. Fixed amount of medical expenses. Shen Bao Cup Basketball Tournament</p>
<h3>Competition Regulations Passed at Yesterday's Meeting of the Competition Committee</h3>
<p>The Shen Bao Cup Basketball League will begin soon. The Competition Committee held its first meeting yesterday. Attendees included Zhou Jiaqi, Ling Xitao, Dai Changling, Wang Zhongtao, Zhang Weixiang, Shi Zhaokang, Liu Hesheng, Zhou Wenji, Yang Shuding, Ma Chonggan, Mei Bixian, Shen Zhenchao, etc. The meeting was personally presided over by Mr. Chen, the president of this newspaper. The league's competition regulations were passed. The league is determined to be of a Shanghai-based nature, divided into Group A and Group B. The number of teams will be determined by the possible allocation of venues. The main venue will be the gym of the Army Dormitory on Jing'an Temple Road (formerly the Xiqing Basketball Hall). Games will be held every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 6:30 PM. Invited teams will be limited to member teams of the Shanghai Basketball Association.</p>
<h3>Shucheng Cup A1 Final: Fuguang vs. Zhenhua</h3>

The two teams and Youlian are now tied with one loss each, and a final match will be held on Wednesday to determine the winner. In Group A2, Huatong defeated Haiyun 4-0, winning the top spot in the division. The final match of the day was between Fuguang and Zhenhua for the A1 title. The two teams put on an excellent performance. In the first half, Zhang Gaozhen of Zhenhua headed in a goal, taking the lead. After the lemon break, Han Longhai scored with a header, tying the score at 1-1. Until the end of the match, neither side scored again. According to the rules, the game should have gone into overtime, but because it was getting late, it was impossible to continue. The final will be replayed this week.</p>

<h3>After Electricity Restrictions</h3>
<p>— Ti Yan</p>
<p>There is no objection to the intention of the Electricity Company to promote production by further restricting electricity consumption. However, I dare not agree with the uniform restriction of 50% for residents. In Shanghai's common people's lane houses, most buildings house seven or eight tenant families. Ordinary electricity consumption is already as frugal as it can be. The current limit is only thirteen degrees per month, and even with the utmost effort, it is only enough for half a month. After the stipulated amount of electricity is used up, the landlord closes the main switch to prevent tenants from privately exceeding the limit and causing damage to the line. The tenants have no choice but to endure the high cost of switching to rush lights and vegetable oil lamps. In this way, electricity is saved, but the potential for future fires is not an unfounded worry. Especially for those living upstairs, if there is a fire in the middle of the night, the loss of property is a small matter. In such complete darkness, coupled with panic, I dare not say that they will be spared the tragedy of being burned to death! As for children of school age who study their books and arithmetic under the faint light every night, the damage to their eyesight is not worth considering!</p>
<p>However, it is a different story if only one family lives in a building. Although there are many rooms, when nothing is happening, the family sits in one room, chatting about their affairs. Although they are restricted, there is still plenty of electricity. Since they do not use it all, they continue to use electric stoves to avoid the risk of further reductions, and they can also save on high fuel costs. There is nothing more unfair than this! In my opinion, it is best to order the landlords to submit a household registration form to check the number of tenant families, and set a standard of only allowing each tenant family to use a certain number of light bulbs, and stipulate the total amount of electricity consumption. This will truly achieve the original purpose of conservation, and things can be used to their full advantage. I believe that the Electricity Company has no shortage of insightful people and will definitely adjust this unreasonable restriction to comfort us!</p>
<h3>Grand Situation of Charity Sale of Mooncakes</h3>
<p>The Guanshengyuan Food Company, in response to helping students and providing relief to the poor, made extra-large mooncakes and held a charity sale for ten days starting from the 17th. For a time, the number of visitors was endless, and the situation was unprecedented. In the past two days, Mr. Yang Runzhen righteously purchased a "Three Pools Mirroring the Moon" mooncake for 6,000 yuan. Mr. Kan Jingliang righteously purchased a "Peaceful Years" mooncake for 10,000 yuan. Mr. Li Shimin righteously purchased a "Three Pools Mirroring the Moon" mooncake for 6,000 yuan. The above three mooncakes totaled 22,000 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates, which the company has duly delivered to this office. It is still hoped that the enthusiastic public will actively participate and contribute to the good cause.</p>
<h3>Wanlan Girls' Middle School Continues to Enroll Half-Fee Students</h3>
<p>Wanlan Girls' Middle School at 560 Shunchang Road, in view of the fact that schools have successively started classes, and there are quite a few poor and outstanding students who are unable to afford tuition and are wandering outside the door, has specially set up 50 additional half-fee places. Those with excellent grades and poor family circumstances can apply to pay half the fee (1,500 yuan). Those with supporting documents can be exempted from the entrance examination. It is reported that the school officially started classes on the 18th. Those who aspire to study and are hesitating on the wrong path can quickly go to the school to register and avoid missing the opportunity. It is also understood that the school's attached women's supplementary classes still have vacancies in Chinese, English, and Mathematics. The time is optional, and there are no restrictions on level or age.</p>
<h3>Donation for Maternity Assistance</h3>
<p>Mr. Yan Guangyong wrote in a letter: "Madam Shi, the wife of Mr. Xu Yunnan of Hongxin Dyeing and Weaving Company, recently celebrated her 50th birthday. Guangyong and others should have offered a toast to express our congratulations. However, Mr. Xu sincerely considered the difficult times and did not want to hold any celebrations. Therefore, he transferred the congratulatory gift of 6,800 yuan to your office as maternity assistance funds to show his support and blessing to Mr. Xu and his virtuous wife. The breakdown is as follows: Zhou Heshou, Shu Xumou, Xu Jianhong, and Yan Guangyong 1,000 yuan each. Gong Xiqing, Wei Zeyao, and Xu Shiyong 500 yuan each. Fang Shanbin 400 yuan. Yao Runfu and Le Zhenfan 250 yuan each. Shen Heyuan and Zou Zuotong 200 yuan each."</p>
<h3>Chinese Education Moral Society Expands Small Loan Program</h3>
<p>The Chinese Education Moral Society on Zhengyang Road, in view of the increasingly difficult times, in order to enable the general poor people to support themselves, in addition to the annual charitable activities such as providing porridge and materials, has expanded the scope of the original small loan program and proposed 200,000 yuan as a foundation. Any poor households that are unable to make a living can apply for a loan from the society after finding a guarantor. The loan amounts are divided into three types: 1,000, 2,000, and 3,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Water Outage in Xujiahui: Urge Speedy Restoration</h3>
<p>The entire area along the western side of Huashan Road in the 4th District, Xujiahui, has suddenly been cut off from tap water since the 15th. There is not a drop of water day and night. Residents, with no other options, have been drawing water from public taps on other roads or from nearby earth wells. The situation is even more crowded in the evening, and disputes often occur as a result. It has been found that this water outage is limited to Xujiahui only. It is hoped that the China Central Water and Electricity Authority will investigate the cause as soon as possible and restore tap water soon. (Yale)</p>
<h3>Lin Zhentang Offers Free Injury Treatment Vouchers</h3>
<p>Mr. Tong Zhongyi is skilled in injury treatment and is well-known in the field. Lin Zhentang has printed free injury treatment vouchers to be given to the poor and sick.

<h3>Fifth Session of Voluntary Smoking Cessation Completed</h3>
<p>The voluntary reformation smoking cessation center affiliated with the Chinese Education Moral Society, under special agreement with this office, has completed its fifth session of group smoking cessation, with a total of eleven people. A farewell ceremony was held at the society's auditorium yesterday morning at 10:00 AM. Dozens of guests from all walks of life attended. During the ceremony, Mr. Li Huifa, Mr. Huang Jingwan, Mr. Tang Zuxiang, and others delivered speeches, urging the reformed smokers to never smoke again. Their sincere words moved the audience.</p>
<h3>Still at Old Price</h3>
<p>Since this office began selling [Shi Si Long] tablets produced by the Muller Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory through charity sales, purchasers have been enthusiastic. The Shanghai Healthcare Association, a hospital under special agreement with this office, also believes that the tablets are very effective after trial use and has successively purchased more. Recently, the prices of Western medicines have increased by more than double, but Muller Pharmaceutical Factory does not intend to raise prices for the time being in order to give preference to charity sales. Each box (20 tablets) is still sold at the original price of 400 yuan. Therefore, those who wish to purchase are urged to do so as soon as possible. [Shi Si Long] tablets are mainly used for acute and chronic pneumonia, influenza, colds, bronchitis, meningitis, acute and chronic gonorrhea, trachoma, laryngitis, rhinitis, otitis media, erysipelas, scarlet fever, mastitis, puerperal fever, and all suppurative diseases.</p>

<h3>Impoverished Teachers Found Used Paper Service Society</h3>
<p>Several impoverished teachers plan to engage in sideline occupations after class to make a living. They have specially organized a used paper service society, but they are currently lacking capital. They hope that enthusiastic people will advance tens of thousands of yuan, with shop security and interest offered. Those willing to help please write to Li Qia at No. 9, Songbali, Xinchang Road. Your gratitude is greatly appreciated. Navy</p>
<h3>Thunderstorm (4)</h3>
<p>— By Toyoo Iwata, translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>Ryufu, feeling uneasy, took the finished painting to submit it.</p>
<p>[Very good!]</p>
<p>That three-word comment from Lieutenant Colonel Tobita passed it. He immediately transferred the painting to the photography class of the Navy Ministry's reporter group, the Black Tide Society.</p>
<p>(How can that be?)</p>
<p>Ryufu returned to his office, feeling shy.</p>
<p>Insufficient preparation must also be a reason for failure, so he no longer waited for orders but permanently spread out the paper in preparation.</p>
<p>Even so, his heart was still uneasy.</p>
<p>(Ah, I was too excited to paint clearly. Forgetting to paint is not allowed.)</p>
<p>When he discovered his fundamental shortcomings, the order to paint a second time came again.</p>
<p>This time it was to paint England. On December 10, the Prince of Wales, the unsinkable battleship, and the battlecruiser Repulse were sunk off Kuantan. Such a great victory that shocked the world was again the achievement of our Japanese planes.</p>
<p>Ryufu only knew about the anti-aircraft equipment of the battleship Prince of Wales, and was vaguely aware of the rest.</p>
<p>(I want to depict a miracle painting. I want to do the work of an Italian medieval painter in modern times.)</p>
<p>So he drew a large torpedo bomber at the highest point of the drawing paper. He wanted to draw a halo around the torpedo bomber, but he stopped when he thought about the mission of the reportage painting.</p>
<p>However, he was not satisfied with the painting he had completed this time either. He only felt that it was stronger than the first time.</p>
<p>At 3:00 PM on December 18, the detailed report of the Pearl Harbor attack was published. Everyone felt that this great victory was completely like a dragon hidden in the clouds, revealing its full body. The California-class battleships were also sunk. The Maryland, Allison, Utah, and Nevada classes—of which only one battleship and two Class B cruisers could be repaired. The US Pacific Fleet was almost entirely destroyed. At the same time, the losses inflicted on the enemy's air power were also very great.</p>
<p>(The power of airplanes is really great!)</p>
<p>Ryufu repeated a grateful word.</p>
<p>But the second paragraph of the publication also said: The Special Attack Force had established unparalleled feats in that naval battle. In addition, the third paragraph was about our losses: 29 aircraft and 5 special submarines that had not yet returned.</p>
<p>(What are special submarines? What kind of ships are they?)</p>
<p>It was not Ryufu alone who was not greatly moved by the tragic feeling because the publication was simple. (142)</p>
