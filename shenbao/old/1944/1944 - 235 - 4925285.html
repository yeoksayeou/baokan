<h3>社評　再論市政與人事</h3>
<p>昨論市政與人事，僅就一般討論，意猶未盡。茲再就所見，進一步申述之。</p>
<p>就當前市政人事不健全的現象，試加分析：則　爲一部分用人不當，　爲待遇不當，　爲賞罰不當。更分別言之：</p>
<p>一部分用人不當者，例如才職不稱，濫芋充數。若干單位間有專用私人和同鄉，不願才具能力如何，有職便派，形成「人人無事，事事無人」的現象，行政效率因此低落，政治建設無法實現。</p>
<p>待遇不當者，例如所予奉給，不能維持一身一家的最低限度生活，但生活又不能停滯，於是不得不另圖活動以期滿足，這種活動大半是非法活動，形成「舞弊業生」的現象。行政效率固無從言之，而機關信譽毀損尤巨。試舉實例言之，如警察。現在警察每月薪津不過二千數百元，在目前高物價程度之下，自難維持一身一家之最低限度生活，而生活却不能不過，於是力圖「外快」，形成公開的秘密行動。如不從調整待遇入手，使之滿足一身一家的最低限度生活，而徒言整頓取締，則南轅北轍必無實效。其次，公務人員亦然。而警察特別顯著者，因其職務最接近老百姓而已。</p>
<p>賞罰不當者，是指過去而言。老實說，過去是無賞無罰賞罰不明的。這次特稅舞弊案件，市政當局已決心秉公澈查，將來必能處以應得之罪，我們主張主犯人員並應追　沒收，以收懲一儆百之效。</p>
<p>我們認爲市政機關的人事不健全現象，猶之人體的病象，如已見病象而不加治療，決不會自然健康的。上面所舉第　　兩項，等於人體已經發現症象。第　項，等於人體的局部，已經潰破，前者需要立時對症下藥，不使潰破。後者需要去腐生新，不使蔓延。</p>
<p>怎樣對症下藥，怎樣去腐生新呢？對於第　項一部分用人不當者，我們昨天已經提出主張市政府設置人事委員會，依照市長的用人方針管理人事，糾正「人人無事，事事無人」之風。聽說市府昨已成立人事委員會，今後希望對用人問題能逐步合理化。對於第　項待遇不當者，應從速調整警察保安隊以及公敎人員的待遇，譬如警察待遇，警察當局應速編　最理想的預算，提供市政當局，由當局約集社會領袖商討籌足預算經費辦法，即予實施。警察當局明知警察待遇不够生活而不提出調整辦法，這是警察當局的責任，市政當局與社會領袖明知警察待遇不够生活而不考慮調整辦法，這是市政當局與社會領袖的責任。警察俸給所入不够生活，而徒講精神訓練，期其不做壞事，這是難事。惟看先調整待遇，然後施以精神訓練，嚴定罰則，才是釜底抽薪，根本方法。對於第　項賞罰不當者，今後如能不徇私情，論理最易糾正，因爲依法懲辦不需經費，而於社會觀感與政治風氣，大有一新耳目之效。</p>
<p>總之，用人不當與賞罰不當兩種現象，完全視乎市政各級當肩之肯做與否，初非難事。而調整待遇一點，則非空言可致，亦非政府單獨的責任，民間自應盡協方之責。調整待遇，需要經費，經費來源，增稅亦爲一途。如因維護治安，建設市政之需要，而增加若干，並指定若干專作關整警察渝保安隊待遇之用，我們相信只要切切實實認眞做去，市民難增加負担，也必樂意接受的。而社會領袖爲市政前途之光明，爲市民安全與福利，也必樂爲出力促成其事。</p>

<p>東京二十五日中央社電　日大東亞相重光氏，關於此次日本銀行對中央備備銀行借與鉅款事，發表談話如次：「協助中國通貨之發展，確立中央儲備銀行之基礎，乃日本政府之一買方針。此次日本銀行對中央儲備銀行貸予四萬萬元之借款，即此方針之一具體表現，日本因鑒於朮中國經濟之健全發展及保持通貨價値之安定，借款一事，乃當前迫切之急務，故日本政府益强化從來之方針，極力協助其通貨政策之圓滑進展，乃固定方針」。</p>
<h3>日首相歡宴　周代院長</h3>

<h3>日政府奏請　召集臨時議會　九月六日起開會五天</h3>

<h3>羅斯福特使訪渝　敵美別具用心　松島部長發表談話</h3>
<p>日本艦隊報道部松島部長，昨（二十五）日循例會見滬市中國新聞記者團，對東綫戰况中國問題等發表談話。茲誌其要點於後：</p>
<h3>東綫戰况</h3>
<p>現在東部戰綫之華沙德軍，反攻非常激烈，並且V二號新兵器亦已出現於東綫戰塲，今後決定性的激戰，即將展開，故吾人於未見此項決戰以前，自不能對交戰國之命運，妄加批評。</p>
<h3>美使訪渝</h3>
<p>據二十一日華盛頓電，基督科學導報發表稱：此次美國戰時生產局長官納爾遜及哈雷少將，將爲羅斯福總統之特使訪渝，其訪渝目的據謂：預備在華建造一大兵工廠，亦即「愛好自由的」美國企圖把中國化爲一大兵工廠。從前尼米資曾言：「聯合軍登陸中國一，此事實進一層地說明尼米資之政策。據羅斯福宣稱：「哈雷關於軍事問題補給問題，納爾遜關於經濟問題，將與蔣介石有所協議」。當然在現代重工業之過程中，若無相當之資財，機械和時間，欲建造一大兵工廠是不易達成的，因是之故，美派二人來華，使中國成一大兵工廠是不可能的，此爲吾人可想而知之事。假使敵美之計劃一旦實行，中國之命運究竟是否能因此而有所補救。前兩日，本人曾對「愛好自由的」國家——美國企圖以中國化爲戰塲之事，曾發表談話，促使中國人民之醒覺，今日美欲化中國爲大兵工廠，　天堂之中國變成地獄之　毒陰謀，把中國國土作　英美的戰塲，吾人將不　任何犧牲，以事預防。</p>
<h3>爲中國憂</h3>
<p>但目下之　勢，渝方正與此旨背道而馳，我人深爲中國　　。又悉，重慶行政院參　張平羣向記者發表談話：「戰後英國航空機製　　爲發展中國之航空事業，預備以一千萬鎊貨與中國」。同時張平羣復云：「關於戰後工業紙發展上，中國有極豐富之天然資　，同時人的資源亦極充沛，唯有資本與技術之缺乏，此爲衆人所承認者，所以吾人極歡迎外國投資和技術上之援助」。試想以愛好自由的國家自稱之美國，欲使快樂之中國化爲兵工廠，中國究竟若否獲得幸福，實可耐味尋思。</p>
<h3>渝報謠傳</h3>
<p>據二十一日重慶中央日報安徽特派員訊，最近上海因空襲轟炸之結果，居民紛紛逃散，因是之故，對火車及　車均採取嚴格限制。事實上現在上海交通的限制，其主要目的在乎米及重要物資之運輸，決非爲防止一般居民逃散之故。</p>
<h3>日大東亞省　强化顧問制</h3>
<p>東京二十五日中央社電　日本大東亞相重光氏，爲强化大東亞政策，此次特將大東亞省顧問制加以充實，決定聘請前大東亞相靑木一男，前日本銀行總裁結城豐太郎及安岡正篤爲顧問，二十五日業由大東亞省發表，因此，現大東亞省顧問，連同現任國民政府最高顧問小倉正恒共爲四名。</p>
<h3>國府經濟建設工作　將更見飛躍進展　盟邦鉅額貸款具有重大意義</h3>
<p>南京二十五日中央社電　盟邦政府當局前爲慟助國府中央儲備銀行之發行制度臻於健全起見，曾於民國三十一年七月，由日木銀行借欵日金一萬萬元，予我中央儲備銀行，以爲增加中儲行之發行準備，於是中儲券準備倍形充沛·信用日著，流通日廣，迄今華中。華南。淮海等地，均無不以中儲券爲唯一法定通貨，其於國府之金融調節，與夫經濟建設上，均收獲莫大效果。不特此也，本年初更與聯合準備銀行確定中儲券之交換辦法，與正金銀行訂立對南方各地之集中滙兌制度，因此中儲券不但已爲成爲國內唯一信用通貨，且更進而確立其貿易通貨之性格。此次中央儲備銀行得日木政府之斡旋，與日本銀行締結四億元之鉅額借欵，此舉不論於國府之決戰金融體制上，與東亞共榮建設前途，實具有　時代之重大意義，故我今後之經濟建設工作實深堪期待。因此消息傳出，全國上下成極感奮，而此次鉅額借欵之再度成立，我人於感分奮幸之餘，又有不能已於言者。　盟邦政府際此大東亞戰爭正已進入決戰階段之際，爲貫澈實踐中日同盟條約之精神，對我國府戰時之財力，仍能予以極大援助，實爲吾人所不能忘懐，而深切感謝者。　由於此次鉅額借欵之成立，我國府經濟建設前途，當軍有飛躍之進展，是可預卜，尤其際此物價問題尙未得合理解決之際，今得此鉅額借欵，對於安定民生前途，實覺無限光明。　大東亞戰爭正臨決戰關頭，負有保衛大後方重任之我國，對於整個決戰經濟之完成，今後亦當因國內經濟建設之愈益進展，而於爭取決勝條件愈形有利。</p>
<h3>財政當局深表謝意</h3>
<p>南京二十五日中央社電　關於日本銀行供給中央儲備銀行借款事，財政當局發表談話如次：「此次中央儲備銀行因日本政府之斡旋，與日本銀行締結日金四萬萬元借款契約，業於今日在東京關印竣事。自本借款成立，合以前年所簽訂之日金一萬萬元，對中央儲備銀行之借款，前後共計日金五萬萬元，於我國通貨制度之健全發展，及中央儲備銀行一般信用之無限增强，資助頗大，吾人對於盟邦日本之絕大支援，深表謝意。中央儲備銀行創設以來，一切雖均能順利發展，然際此重大時局，在參戰之我國，其中央銀行爲與盟邦協力一致，則當務之急，莫更要於安定金融及維持通貨兩事，今得有四萬萬元日金借款之供給，顯見中日兩國中央銀行結合之緊密，中央儲備銀行信用之益增强大，其所負之使命，亦必因以達成，關係之大，莫甚於此。今後吾人必當更事努力，對於安定金融及維持通貨，務期毫無遺遺憾」。</p>
<h3>安定民生貢獻極大</h3>
<p>南京二十五日中央社電　中央儲備銀行日本銀行間成立四億元信用借款後，此間各界人士，一致表示歡迎，尤其金融界方面，認我國之通貨價值可更形鞏固，從而對於物價之抑平，民生之安定，將有極大貢獻。如再從大處而言，則當此戰時，我國整個經濟體制，於逐漸轉向決戰體制之時，得此助力，自可更加推進，故此次中儲與日銀問四億日元新借款之成立，對於我國決戰經濟體制之整備，定將有極大貢獻。各方尤其深信，此次借款成立後，對於我國上下積極努力中之增產工作及其他建設事業，自將更有飛　　展，如此，不僅對國民生活有極大裨益，則對大東亞戰爭之協力完成，亦益可發揮强大之力量。</p>
<p>日大使館當局談話日　華大使館當局，關於中儲銀行與日本銀行成立四億元信用借款事五日，日本銀行與中央傳備銀行間，訂立四億日元信用借款契約，已由兩銀行總裁正式簽字。帝國政府過去爲使中國中央銀行之中央儲備銀行維持其發行之通過價值，並謀其安定起見，會不惜予以一切之支援協力，此次兩中央銀行間又新　信用借款契約，實足以具體表現日本之一貫方針，深信此　益於國民政府通貨制度之健全發展，及中國經濟之健全進展者至大，故實深堪同　也。</p>

<h3>泰宣布整理國軍設陸海空總指揮國防軍最高司令名義撤銷</h3>
<p>盤谷二十五日中央社電　泰國阿巴溫首相發表聲明如次：此次軍首腦之異動，以巴洪大將爲軍總指揮官，政府此種措置，完全爲國家及國民利益，國民諸君對此萬勿輕作杞憂。關於畢本前最高司令官動向，雖難免種種傳說，即畢本元帥本人，亦對此種傳說加以否認，而對現政府表示好意，故此種傳說全屬子虛。</p>
<p>盤谷二十四日中央社電　泰國前首相畢本元帥自辭去首相職務後，仍以國防軍最高司令官名義掌握一切軍權，阿巴溫新內閣有鑒於此，爲統合軍隊起見，二十四日頒令，整理現有國軍及撤銷前國防軍最高司令官名義，另行任命巴洪大將爲陸海空軍總指揮官，同時以畢本前首相爲國政顧問，對其他國軍首腦之陣容，亦斷然加以調整。</p>
<p>幣本改任國政顧問</p>
<p>此次法定業於二十四日夜以勅令及首相布吿發表如次：　政府有鑒於畢本元帥多年功績，規以攝政動令賜予名譽地位，自八月二十四日以後，任畢本元帥爲泰國國政顧問，　根據泰國戒嚴令之規定，將現有國防軍最高司令官及副最高司令官名義廢除，同時設陸海空軍總指揮官，統帥陸海空軍及野戰警察，任命巴洪大將爲總指揮官，約他拉克爲副總指揮官　陸軍司令官，陸軍野戰軍司令官以畢本元帥之辭職，任命巴洪大將繼任陸軍司令官。　任國務大臣約他拉克爲國防副大臣，擔任防空事宜。　以勅令任命總指揮官後，更以首相布吿任命約他拉古中將爲陸軍副司令官及睦軍野戰副司令官。</p>
<p>阿巴溫吿日國民書</p>
<p>盤谷二十五日中央社電阿巴溫首相二十四日發表吿日本國民書如次：日泰兩國素有親善關係，因之乃有同盟條約之締結，進而確立東亞永久和平之某礎，於茲余對泰國民之支援日本國民當再加以認識，同時並披瀝泰國民協力日本究成大東亞戰爭之決意。泰國民對日本國民之過去事蹟及其勇戰奮鬥精神，極爲欽佩，相信此次大東亞戰爭必能獲得最後勝利，泰國於茲祝福日本國民，同時並敬祝日軍勝利，俾完成日本帝國永遠繁榮。日軍決支援</p>
<p>大緬甸聯盟</p>
<p>仰光二十五日中央社電　緬甸一千六百萬民衆，在巴莫國家代表統率下，結成大緬甸聯盟。廿四日河邊最高指揮官發表聲明，表明緬甸方面日派遣軍全體將士，決舉全力支特聯盟，共同完成戰爭西戰區司令官張發奎，七月中旬爲防衛桂林，特於廣西綏靖主任公署內設立桂林城防司令部，任集團軍副總司令意雲淸爲司令，現彼已得桂林防空疏散委員會之援助，强行疏散市民，由靑年團戰時服務總務隊隊員援助實施。渝軍事委員會廣西船舶總隊，於桂林·梧州·平樂·等地特設辦事處。西南輸入物督勵委員會，亦積極疏散集中桂林及其附近之物資，現在之桂林移住許多文化人，彼等屢次非難渝方之政治施策，大多數市民亦與之共鳴。渝檢查當局在此日軍怱進之際，深恐人心動搖，連日檢查市民證，並監視各種團體之行動。此外復嚴禁市民集會，在日軍進擊前，渝軍當局暴露狼狽情形，徒招惹市民嘲笑，與反對而已云。</p>
<h3>渝方防衛桂林強行疏散市民深恐湘省日軍南進</h3>
<p>廣州二十五日中央極重視日軍之動向，認爲粵漢綫必將爲日軍打通，更推迎湖南日軍必將南下，乃積極防衛韶關。桂林·及梧州等前衛據點。據最近當地所得消息稱：廣日軍積極修理</p>
<p>粤漢鐵路</p>
<p>中國戰綫基地二十四日中央社電　華南方面渝軍因日軍沿粵漢綫節節北上，故極度恐慌，現已將沿綫附近居民疏散，從事澈底破壞工作。據日從軍記者稱，其破壊之慘實一言難盡，鐵路已無鐵軌，枕木野草業生，約三百米乃至五百米，被破壞之鐵路綫跡間斷連續，各橋樑均炸毀無餘，築堤部潰決十米之處頗多。更利用自然之流水及河川，使之自己潰決。日軍則仍排除萬難，不分晝夜，繼續修理破毀地點，積極開闢應急公路。另一方面廣東省建設麼組織工作隊，協力日軍。沿綫一帶居民，每村選派五十名至一百名，亦從事此項恢復工作。現源潭以南之公路，業已完成多年，未見汽車之當地居民，刻正以喜悅心情，協力日軍建設鐵路。京勞動營</p>
<p>舉行拔營式</p>
<p>南京二十五日中央社電　新國民運動靑年暑期勞動服務營，自於二十三日開始在淸凉寺露營後，各學員情緒無不十分熱烈。中華電影公司特於二十四日晨前往攝取新聞片。日本大使館松本書記官，昨日下午亦前往參觀，深表讚佩。當晚舉行夕陽會，林營長並親至營地訓示。又露營日程業定今日終了，下午舉行拔營式，將由林營長親臨主持，以示隆重。</p>
<h3>渝共意見分歧終難期合作美欲以中國爲决戰塲</h3>
<p>華中前綫某基地二十五日中央社電　重慶與延安間之爭鬥，着手調整以來，已由西安之預備交涉進而至重慶之正式會議。在此會議期中，雖有反軸心之熱烈應援，與美國副大總統華萊士之慫恿勸吿，但兩方主張之對立，並未因此解決。按此次會談，乃調整重慶與延安間，自去夏皖南衝突以來，繼續發生之各項事件，以謀恢復雙方於抗戰初期之合作。惟因彼此政治要求相差懸　殊，兩者會談時之提案，又皆係過去之</p>
<p>根本問題</p>
<p>故重慶不論如何讓步，於否認延安政權發表之前，終難期合作。但反軸心各國亦以爲此項責任，當由重慶方面肩負。據莫斯科「戰爭與勞動階級」雜誌，及英國共產黨報紙等，皆責難重慶之包圍延安事項。又紐約泰晤士報亦代延安發表攻擊重慶之一黨專權，以爲遠反民主主義。故重慶在美國壓制，及延安攻擊之下，處境實難。一方延安與芙國接近，亦爲對重慶之一種牽制作用。蓋美國野心不外犧牲中國，以達其對日作戰之目的，在堅持抗戰，以發展中國之</p>
<p>赤色革命</p>
<p>兩者目的一致，自然便於合作。又延安之政治理論為新民主主義，與歐美之民主有共通之點。更因最近美空軍直接要求空軍基地關係，皆爲兩者間易於接近之最大原因。按美國以中國大陸爲基地，企圖轟炸日本本土，已爲旣定方針。其第二十航空隊以成都爲基地，空襲日本，前援已達四次。最近因湖南作戰敗績，駐於華南之美空軍已不得不往後退，因之愈感於中國內地及西北區設立基地之必要。茲者，美軍官與軍事專家等組成之美國軍事視察團，已於本月十二日</p>
<p>抵達延安</p>
<p>關於該</p>
<p>視察團之目的，重慶發言人會談稱，乃為謀求對被迫着陸而致負傷之美軍，協力援助辦法，及菄集關於氣象及其他各種情報爲目的。至於延安地區是否爲對日空襲之基地，現尙不能明言云。蓋西北地區新基地之建設，乃延安方面之旣定計劃，同時美國旣企圖對滿洲加以轟炸，其於陝北地方覓求基地，亦可想像及之云。湖垛鎭</p>
<p>美機一架墜毀</p>
<p>日軍某基地二十五日中央社電　駐渝美空軍B29型機一架，會於二十日下午十時許，在湖垜鎭（蘇省　城西方二十八公里）降落，其殘骸業由當地日軍收容。茲調查其飛來方向及機體，即可推定該機係於二十日空襲北九州時，被日防軍擊毀，飛返中國時，卒因機件受損，降落該地云。</p>
<p>杭市防空會議</p>
<p>杭州二十五日中央社　電抗市防空辦事處，爲商討防空事宜，昨在市府會議室舉行第一次防空會議，決議强化燈火管制，充實防空設備。</p>
<h3>巴黎西南郊大戰進行中侵歐軍沿約納河推進</h3>
<p>柏林二十五日中央社電　德國社引德官方戰報稱：巴黎西北地區內，敵由西南二方以强大之部隊，追隨向塞納河下游解脫之德軍，敵於愛爾波（Elbeuf）以南施特强之壓力。巴黎之西，敵於多數坦克車支援下，已攻至該市之西郊，郊外刻正陷於激戰中，德軍於反攻時，擊退企圖由梅隆（Melun在巴黎東南）以西渡過寒納河之敵軍。</p>
<p>柏林二十五日中央社電　德國社訊：諾曼第續有極度熾烈之戰事，其特點之一，爲德軍兵士所顯示之勇敢，甚至敵人亦承認之。法國此一部份之戰事，似已由疾進之坦克車編隊，分成若十個別之行動，但就一般而論，戰爭已擴展至各大區域。德擲彈兵不顧反軸心軍數量之優越，英勇抵抗，蓋因德軍兵士均相信彼等爲公正之主義與民族之前途而作戰，故將竭力達到此目的。德軍編隊在反軸心軍緊隨之下，奮力保持由列西安（Lisieux）通至奧貝克（Orbec）而轉達康煦（Conches）之總陣綫，該陣綫由康煦通至埃佛婁（Evreux）與柏賽（Pacy）而止於凡爾農。埃佛婁之西，美軍已經由波納維爾，向北突破而抵達勒紐堡（LeNeuboury）之東南。星期三在短時間內，反軸心飛機向康煦小市鎭轟炸前後八次，足見英美軍在不久之將來將繼　襲擊該地區。在巴黎區美軍迄今僅以坦克車偵查部隊，向德軍陣綫探索而進，德軍對巴黎之西與西南之恐怖份子，正在進行激戰。京城之南德後防隊已撤退至科貝爾·逢丹勃魯綫（Corbell-Fontainebleau）。約納河上（在巴黎南）羅米里（Romily）與特羅伊（Toryes）附近之局勢尙未呈明朗化，在該處指揮作戰之巴頓將軍，其目的似在包圍巴黎以南及塞納河迤東之德軍部隊，或企圖切斷德軍與法南部之一切交通。</p>

<p>南京短簡</p>
<p>南京四郊的農村素描　閔賢</p>
<p>記者一行連日冒暑前往巴斗山，大勝關，孝陵衛，　　山，小行山等各地農村，分別巡禮，對於首都郊外農村得窺全貌詳細報告，尙待整理。茲僅將各地外在的情形，提前報道如能引起當局主義於復興農村經濟，則幸甚矣。</p>
<p>治安第一遍歷各農村，因距離首都不遠，故一切不合理的特殊情形尙不多見，尤其遊匪共黨亦少活動，各村農民生活，尙稱安定。惟郊外各村，時有地方軍人強買「或竟強要」柴草，進城牟利。（按現在南京柴草每担價約六七百元之間，）難免使他農家感覺攪擾不寗，聞當局業經三令五申，加以取締，但言者　　，聽者藐藐，欲謀安定農村，似宜從小處着手，實際予以補救。</p>
<p>亟待指導年來當局高呼復興農村，提倡增產，我們久處都市中者，每讀報紙上的　言偉論，自難免若干感動。在改進上言，農村若不加以實際指導，恐難收效。譬如距京市甚近之燕子磯區，第四五兩保內大槪有三十餘畝地均種權石榴，記者經過該地即見潰爛石榴，委棄於地，而樹上之害蟲　集，亦無人加以驅除，可見培植方法，不合科學，詢諮富地農人，則答云「這些石榴樹所有主大多，大家祗要每年能收一點，也就算了。」秋收農忙，田間農人正在打稻，方法陳舊，故稻牀雖多，難收事半功倍之效。在　上歇息間，得悉此間亦有某種深灰團體之組織，經費由村鎭人口按戶　派負担，權利可得日用品配給紙享受，及農產品技術上之指導，但按之事實，徒有其表，配給品百不得一。尤其所謂農業指導員者，乃一師範出身之靑年，雖其苦幹之精神値得欽佩，然於農科常識，似有欠缺，其不能指導他人明矣。由此更可知僅在都市中關心農村之專家，祗以召集會議高呼增產之形式，似嫌不足，必須具有　才實學，於農村經濟素有心得之士，深入農村，對症下藥，實際加以指導改良農作物，助之以物質，使鄉間蘊蓄之力，半荒之土，蓋情發揮其功能，而達增產之效，非如是實難　　功。</p>
<p>耕牛缺乏各農村農民之自有耕牛者甚少，每村有三數頭耕牛已屬少見，由此可明一般農民並不富裕，所富足者亦祗少數大地主，一般農人欲需耕牛代力者，得向地主租賃，代價每畝有高至二千餘元，所以半自耕農及一般無力者，處處受盡剝削，平日仍有難得一飽，病時又無錢診治，所謂大魚吃小魚者，在農村中亦有之。尤其痛心者，少數家有耕牛者，因一時急用，而將唯一代力之耕牛忍痛賣去，渡過眼前急難，但耕牛漸減，而當局對於治標，亦並未加以嚴厲取締，治本則極少農業貸款，長此以往，鄉間耕牛勢將絕跡，絕非言之過甚。</p>
<p>表面　榮記者所經過各農村集鎭，居然也有許多摩登奢侈用品，五光十色，應有儘有，考其享用者，不是大地主，就是當地一般有特殊勢力之特殊人物。一般農民則夢想不到，在都市之人，總以爲糧價高昂，農民富足，深嘆都市不如農村。按其實際，米糧之昂，雖是事實，但經過重重剝削之下，農民得到實惠者，微乎其微，尤其一般佃農，大多呻吟於高利貸，「有借錢千元相隔四五月除還本外，利息需小麥一担，按値一千八百元」，同樣的，農民正嘆農村不如都市也。</p>

<h3>厲行國民宴會禁止打醮</h3>
<p>在戰時體制之下；節約糜費，防止物力虛耗，尤爲當務之急。本市社會福利局及本市節約協會莫不重視異常，最近又爲厲行國民宴會，協助推行節電辦法曁禁止打醀等迷信行爲，特於昨（二十五）日聯合召集本市旅館飯店，中西酒菜館各同業，及各區總聯保人員，於下午三時及五時，分別在福利局會議室內懇談，社會福利部長丁默邨氏親臨致訓。茲分誌詳情如次：</p>
<p>過去流弊取巧掩飾三時召集全市旅館飯店中西酒菜業同業代表，商　勵行節約宴會，及推行節電辦法，各方出席代表自丁部長以下，有孫局長鳴歧，陳處長東白，節約協會理事長裴　卿會以來，迄今兩月，實施成效，尙未作嚴格檢查，在各同業方面，因應　客需求，甚至施用種種逃避限制辦法，企圖巧爲掩飾一，如此情形，殊爲違反節約原則，亟盼切實遵守，如因原料飛漲，亦可作合理申請，調整公定價格。當局方面絕對顧全商艱，同時今後即將展開檢查工作，如發現違規情事，當予嚴厲懲處，希各同業自一動遵守。</p>
<h3>厲行節約　實施檢查</h3>
<p>機由節約協會常務理事魯風致詞：「希望積一極的自動推行節約辦法，如上海一地不能實踐節約辦法，對國家民族影響至鉅，且在此戰時體制下，推行國民宴會，防止糜費乃爲必然之工作，如高等酒菜及奢華鬥勝，均足影響一般物價，徒使平民遭受生活高壓之痛苦，深盼各方協助政府切實厲行節一，避免種種非法流弊云云。」節約協會總幹事任雲鵬繼起致詞：指出旅館通書雀戰，及酒菜館反常熱鬧等現象，爲各業迎合顧客，不惜以巧妙方法規避取締等舞弊行爲，並發表節約宴會推行辦法，今後將派遣靑年學生分別與酒菜等同業合作檢查，期達早日完成國民宴會之限制工作。旋由節約協會常務理事顧南羣致詞，深盼各同業本身，對範約任務澈底了解，今後在檢查工作上，亦應至誠合作，協力政府推行。後由旅館業代表丁聲中西酒菜館業代表鄔秉庸等，相繼致詞，對厲行節約宴會及節電辦法，表示贊同，決協力維護，惟對於採辦原料，請求福利當局協助轉知市塲，壓低批售價格云云。</p>
<h3>官民合作　保障物力</h3>
<p>丁部長致訓，略謂：「關於電力節約，素由電力公司嚴格執行，且各位均具熱忱努力遵行，不必再予說明，惟對於節約宴會一點，本人特乘此機會，加以闡明：限制國民宴會乃福利部所主張者，絕非以官方權力干預商店營業自由，際此物資缺乏，情形日益嚴重，如再不予節約，將來經濟上及物價上，困難將更增多，且消耗物力過鉅，不但民生遭受打擊，而國家元氣損失更大。再因運輸困難物資流通不易，希望減少消耗，則物價當能日趨下落。總之節約乃以保陣物力爲出發點，深盼時別瞭解運照規定辦法，切實合作推行。今後所派之檢查人員，亦經政府當局之認可，在同一立塲密切合作，以底於成」云云。最後由顧常務理事對於各同業踴躍參加，及工部長親臨致訓，深表謝意，歷時二小時始畢。</p>
<h3>破除迷信　嚴禁打醮</h3>
<p>旋於五時開始對各區總聯保長談話，出席各總聯保長有朱啓楨·許曉初·周夢白·樂鳳麟·姚姜璋等，首由丁部長闡明推動節約工作，深賴保甲合作之意義，並申述打醮等類迷信舊俗，至今猶未完全打破，此類迷信行爲，不但耗費民財，物力損失更屬不貨，並造成流氓地病詐財機會，盼各保甲區自動勸導民衆，協力禁止，則對個人社會國家民族，裨益非淺。繼由孫局長致詞後，又由保甲代表周夢白發表意見，對禁止打醀迷信一舉，頗表贊同，旋全體一致決議，澈底禁止，方法先由各區總聯保畏向木區民衆勸導禁止外，並由福利局及節約協會分別函請本市警察局，一曁保甲處轉飭各該所屬，　嚴禁止，至下午六時始業。</p>
<h3>北站秩序　已見改善</h3>
<p>本市北站警務自改歸市警察局西虹口分局接辦後，情形尙稱良好，站內外秩序之維持，巳由該管分局加派長警積極改善，尤對向例之站內搜查一項，已予禁止，無論大包小裹，一槪不得藉故檢查，以防流弊。至於黑市票買買，自華中鐵道公司訂定購票新辦法後，業已說減，一向專以　黑市票爲生之所謂「黃牛薰」，日趨欲　，一般情形，可謂滿意。</p>
<h3>已完統稅貨物　免轉口稅　關務署呈准財部備案</h3>
<p>關於應完統稅，菸酒稅，或礦產稅之貨物，海關方面，向憑完稅單照查騐放行，但征免轉口稅，向不一律，故由海關總稅務司，呈向關務署建議，將凡已完納各該稅之貨物，槪予免征轉口稅，此案業由財部據該署呈請鑒核，刻已指令准予備案，幷轉行知照。原文如次：「案據關務署七月三日呈稱，案據海關總稅務司岸本廣吉呈稱，竊查關於應完統稅，菸酒稅，或礦產稅之貨物，海關方面向憑完稅單照查騐放行，但征免轉口稅，向不一律，茲擬請將凡已完納各該稅之貨物，槪予免征轉口稅。謹將理由　陳如左：　統稅貨物，查已完統稅貨物，如麩皮，麥粉，捲贊，燻烟葉，水泥，火柴，火酒，棉紗，及其直接織成品等，均經光後奉命面征轉口稅，惟啤酒一項，各酒廠出品，除奉命特准免稅者外，其除罹已完納統稅，仍須照繳轉口稅，待遇殊不一致，爲求課稅平允及關務歸於簡易起見，似應予以改善，凡屬已完統稅之啤酒，概予穩懲完稅單，照免征轉口稅。　菸酒稅（土菸業特稅土酒定額稅及洋酒類稅）貨物，查已完菸酒稅貨物，如土酒，土菸葉，及菸絲等均經奉令免征轉口稅，惟洋酒一項，其免征轉口稅範圍，僅以特准各酒廠出品爲限，似亦有失平允，此項菸酒稅貨物，（包括土菸葉特稅，土酒定額稅及洋酒類稅）其免征轉口稅辦法，似應與統稅貨物一律辦理，騐憑巳完菸酒稅單照免征轉口稅。　舖產稅貨物，查應完鑛產稅貨物，前曾迭奉令發一各鑛　名稅額表，下屬凡表列各　產品，如特有已完種產稅單，照海關向係遵照均署二十四年九月二十七日則字第一八一一五號訓令之規定，免征轉口稅，其他　產品似亦應一律　懲，已完　產稅單照，免征轉口稅。所有擬議，凡已完統稅，菸酒稅，或鑛產稅貨物，槪予免征轉口稅。各緣由是否有富，理合將啤酒洋酒特准免稅及　產稅各案續具淸單一紙，並抄同原令一倂備文，呈請鑒核等情，附淸單一紙，抄令文十四件。據此查已完統稅菸酒稅或鑛產稅之貨物，對於免征轉口稅辦法，向不一律，各方時起爭執誤會，此次規定統一辦法，俾成定案：使各有所遵循，查核尙無不合，除指令照準外，理合同原附各件備文呈請鑒核」等情到部，除指命準予備案例，合行令仰知照，併轉行知照。」</p>
<h3>防衛空襲須知防衛空襲意義</h3>
<p>現一部份人對於空襲果難避免與否，尙抱有若干疑問，但事實上敵機已經來襲，且此後難保不來，惟市民對於防空體制，如能採取完全措置，敵雖作如何大空襲，亦不能獲得效果，此以德國爲例，極爲明顯。反之，市民如缺乏準備時，則必因受敵機空襲而蒙重大損失，故如抱輕視之念，適墮敵之聲中，是點必須認淸。要之防衛之本旨，並非爲敵機何時來之問題，而在於完成敵來襲亦無效果之體制。　空襲下之心得</p>
<p>炸彈在附近爆炸，燒夷彈到處落下如處置稍遲，即引起火災，於此種狀態下，任何人均易於心慌意亂，但如於平時對空襲早有準備與訓練，則敵機　落下炸彈，亦不爲狼狽。其次應注意者，即於空襲時必頗有爲各種講　所乘而更形慌亂者，當空襲過後，當屬尙未公佈情形，狀况不明時，極易發生各種流言蜚語。此種無稽謠言，亦有極盡荒唐者。此時能力持冷靜，不爲所惑，信賴當局之指示，秩序即得整然不紊，非常事態下，往往易於引赴混亂者，皆由市民舉動失常所致。當局此祭得考慮整個情勢，以最妥當之方策，指示一般市民，或直接加以指導，惟此種塲合，如市民任意妄動，則混亂反益甚，當局於此際爲盡一力減少犧牲，期市民即能照常從事業務，迄今已加以研究與準備，故市民有絕對信賴當局指導之義務，且爲最安全之方法。</p>
<h3>法院迅速辦案　商定辦法</h3>
<p>上海地方檢查署，頃轉奉部令飭會同高等檢察署及高地二院，將辦　手續會商改進，務求簡便迅速，使案件不至延宕，以免被吿　囚之古。乃由檢察長趙鉦堂臨時召集全體檢察官會議，其討論事項中之主要者計：</p>
<p>（甲）暑期後，警局解案應如何分配案。（決一議）仍照七八兩月份輪値日辦法，指派檢察官二人分配當日所收案件，惟案件數量超過四十件以上時，檢察長臨時增派人員辦理，不及二十件時，僅由檢察官一人辦理，狀訴案件仍照向例平分，前項辦法自九月一日起實行。</p>
<p>（乙）本署本年六月二十七日署務會議，關於勵行保釋一案，　後務須切實遵行案。（決議）照辦。</p>
<p>（丙）暑期後，警察局解送案件擬仍函請於每日上午十時一千解道，以資訊速案。（決議）函請警局照辦。</p>
<p>（丁）本署向警察局調卷送達，以及其他調者事項，　後擬逕行函請各分局辦理，不必再函總局，以免轉輾費時案。（決議）照辦。路衛生署長談</p>

<h3>Editorial: Further Discussion on Municipal Administration and Personnel</h3>
<p>Yesterday's discussion on municipal administration and personnel was merely a general overview, and much remains to be said. Now, based on my observations, I will further elaborate.</p>
<p>Let's analyze the current unsound state of municipal administration and personnel: Firstly, the inappropriate employment of some personnel; secondly, inadequate compensation; and thirdly, unfair rewards and punishments. I will elaborate on each:</p>
<p>Inappropriate employment of some personnel includes mismatches between talent and position, and the filling of positions with unqualified individuals. In some departments, there is a preference for hiring relatives and fellow townsmen, regardless of their skills or abilities. People are assigned to positions simply because they are available, leading to a situation where "everyone is idle, and nothing gets done." This results in low administrative efficiency and hinders the realization of political construction.</p>
<p>Inadequate compensation means that the provided salary cannot sustain the basic living needs of an individual and their family. Yet, life must go on, so they are forced to seek other means to make ends meet. These activities are often illegal, leading to a situation of "corruption breeding corruption." Administrative efficiency is out of the question, and the damage to the credibility of the government is enormous. Take the police as an example. Currently, a police officer's monthly salary is only two thousand and several hundred yuan. Given the current high cost of living, it is difficult for them to sustain the basic living needs of an individual and their family. However, they must live, so they strive to find "extra income," turning it into an open secret. If we do not start by adjusting their compensation to enable them to sustain the basic living needs of an individual and their family, and instead only talk about rectification and suppression, we will be going in the wrong direction and achieve nothing. Secondly, the same applies to civil servants. It is particularly evident in the case of the police because their duties bring them closest to the common people.</p>
<p>Unfair rewards and punishments refer to the past. Frankly speaking, in the past, there was no reward or punishment, or the rewards and punishments were unclear. In the recent special tax fraud case, the municipal authorities have resolved to investigate thoroughly and impartially, and the guilty will surely be punished accordingly in the future. We advocate that the ringleaders should also have their illicit gains confiscated to deter others from similar crimes.</p>
<p>We believe that the unhealthy state of personnel in municipal organizations is like the symptoms of a disease in the human body. If the symptoms are ignored and left untreated, health will not naturally return. The first two points mentioned above are like discovering symptoms in the human body. The third point is like a localized ulceration. The former requires immediate symptomatic treatment to prevent ulceration, while the latter requires debridement and regeneration to prevent it from spreading.</p>
<p>How do we treat the symptoms and promote regeneration? Regarding the first point, the inappropriate employment of some personnel, we proposed yesterday that the municipal government establish a personnel committee to manage personnel according to the mayor's personnel policy, correcting the "everyone is idle, and nothing gets done" situation. We hear that the municipal government established a personnel committee yesterday. We hope that in the future, personnel issues can be gradually rationalized. Regarding the second point, the inadequate compensation, we should promptly adjust the compensation of the police, security forces, and public school teachers. For example, regarding police compensation, the police authorities should quickly prepare the most ideal budget and submit it to the municipal authorities. The authorities should then convene community leaders to discuss ways to raise sufficient budgetary funds and implement the plan immediately. It is the responsibility of the police authorities if they know that the police compensation is insufficient to meet their living needs but fail to propose an adjustment plan. It is the responsibility of the municipal authorities and community leaders if they know that the police compensation is insufficient to meet their living needs but fail to consider an adjustment plan. It is difficult to expect the police to refrain from wrongdoing when their salary is insufficient to meet their living needs, and we only talk about moral training. Only by first adjusting their compensation, then providing moral training, and strictly enforcing penalties, can we address the root cause of the problem. Regarding the third point, unfair rewards and punishments, it will be easiest to correct in the future if we can avoid favoritism and act according to principles. This is because punishing according to the law does not require funding, and it will greatly refresh public perception and political atmosphere.</p>
<p>In short, the two phenomena of inappropriate employment and unfair rewards and punishments depend entirely on whether municipal authorities at all levels are willing to act; it is not a difficult task. However, adjusting compensation cannot be achieved through empty words, nor is it the sole responsibility of the government; the private sector should also fulfill its duty to cooperate. Adjusting compensation requires funding, and raising taxes is one way to obtain funding. If taxes are increased somewhat to maintain public security and build the municipality, and some of the funds are specifically designated for improving the compensation of the police and security forces, we believe that as long as we are earnest and conscientious in our efforts, citizens, despite the increased burden, will be willing to accept it. Community leaders, for the sake of the bright future of the municipality and the safety and well-being of its citizens, will also be happy to contribute to facilitating this matter.</p>
<h3>The Central Reserve Bank and the Bank of Japan Establish Another Credit Loan of 400 Million Yen, to be Repaid Within Five Years</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency telegram) - The Japanese Information Bureau announced at 4 PM on the 25th: "The Japanese government, in order to assist the sound development of the banknotes of the Central Reserve Bank of China, previously provided a loan of 100 million yuan from the Bank of Japan to the Central Reserve Bank on July 28th of Showa 17 (1942). Now, a large amount of 400 million yuan is being loaned."</p>
<p>Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency telegram) - The Central Reserve Bank and the Bank of Japan signed a credit loan agreement on the 25th. The contents are as follows: The Central Reserve Bank may borrow 400 million Japanese yen from the Bank of Japan within five years from the date of conclusion of this agreement. Regarding the repayment of the above loan, the Central Reserve Bank may repay it in one lump sum or within five years from the date of conclusion of the agreement. The term of the loan and the repayment period may be extended after consultation between the Central Reserve Bank and the Bank of Japan.</p>
<h3>Remarks by Finance Minister Zhou</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency telegram) - Zhou Fohai, Minister of Finance of the National Government, recently made the following remarks regarding the loan agreement concluded between the Bank of Japan and the Central Reserve Bank: "Based on the mediation of the Japanese government, the Central Reserve Bank has decided to conclude a loan agreement with the Bank of Japan for 400 million yuan, which has been signed in Japan. With the establishment of this loan, the Central Reserve Bank's loan from Japan, together with the contractual loan of 100 million yuan established the previous year, will amount to 500 million yuan, which will greatly benefit the sound development of China's currency system and the credit of the Central Reserve Bank. I would like to express my deep gratitude to our allied country, Japan, for its assistance. Since its establishment, the Central Reserve Bank has made considerable progress. In this critical situation, the central bank of China, which is participating in the war, should, in cooperation with its ally Japan, first seek financial stability and maintain the value of its banknotes. The allied country's renewed loan of 400 million yuan will truly enable the central banks of the two countries to combine more closely. At the same time, it will further increase the credit of the central bank, which will greatly help in the completion of its mission. In the future, we will make even greater efforts to stabilize finance and maintain the value of the currency."</p>
<h3>Remarks by Mr. Shibusawa</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency telegram) - Zhou Fohai, Governor of the Central Reserve Bank, and Keizo Shibusawa, Governor of the Bank of Japan, formally signed the credit loan agreement at the Bank of Japan at 4 PM on the 25th. According to President Shibusawa, this measure is the same as the previous loan in that it is intended to assist the sound development of the Chinese National Government's currency system. In recent years, the business of the Central Reserve Bank of China has flourished, and the circulation of its banknotes has become increasingly widespread, with very significant development. Sino-Japanese relations have entered a new stage due to China's participation in the war, and the demand for financial cooperation has also intensified. Therefore, the Japanese side, in response to the current situation, decided to extend a credit loan to China. The Bank of Japan will follow the government's policy and do its best to support China's currency policy.</p>
<h3>Remarks by Mr. Shigemitsu</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency telegram) - Mr. Shigemitsu, the Japanese Minister of Greater East Asia, made the following remarks regarding the large loan extended by the Bank of Japan to the Central Reserve Bank: "Assisting the development of Chinese currency and establishing the foundation of the Central Reserve Bank is a consistent policy of the Japanese government. This loan of 400 million yuan from the Bank of Japan to the Central Reserve Bank is a concrete manifestation of this policy. Japan believes that the sound development of the Chinese economy and the stability of the currency's value are matters of urgent importance. Therefore, the Japanese government is strengthening its consistent policy and making every effort to assist the smooth progress of its currency policy, which is a fixed policy."</p>

<h3>Roosevelt's Envoy Visits Chongqing, the Enemy's American Plot is Unique, Remarks by Director Matsushima</h3>
<p>Director Matsushima of the Japanese Naval Fleet Press Department met with the Shanghai Chinese News Reporters Corps yesterday (the 25th) as usual, and made remarks on the Eastern Front war situation and Chinese issues, among others. The main points are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Eastern Front War Situation</h3>
<p>The German forces in Warsaw on the Eastern Front are now launching a very fierce counterattack, and the V-2 new weapon has also appeared on the Eastern Front battlefield. A decisive battle will soon unfold. Therefore, before seeing this decisive battle, we cannot recklessly criticize the fate of the belligerent countries.</p>
<h3>American Envoy Visits Chongqing</h3>
<p>According to a Washington dispatch on the 21st, the Christian Science Monitor reported that Nelson, Director of the US War Production Board, and Major General Hurley will visit Chongqing as special envoys of President Roosevelt. The purpose of their visit is said to be to prepare to build a large arsenal in China, that is, the "freedom-loving" America intends to turn China into a large arsenal. Nimitz once said: "The Allied forces are landing in China..." This fact further illustrates Nimitz's policy. According to Roosevelt's announcement: "Hurley will negotiate with Chiang Kai-shek on military and supply issues, and Nelson on economic issues." Of course, in the process of modern heavy industry, it is not easy to build a large arsenal without considerable capital, machinery, and time. Therefore, it is impossible for the United States to send two people to China to make China a large arsenal. This is something we can imagine. If the enemy's American plan is implemented, will China's fate be remedied as a result? A few days ago, I made a statement on the fact that the "freedom-loving" country - the United States - is trying to turn China into a battlefield, prompting the Chinese people to wake up. Today, the United States wants to turn China into a large arsenal, a poisonous conspiracy to turn the heaven of China into the hell of . To use Chinese territory as a battlefield for Britain and the United States, we will not any sacrifice to prevent it.</p>
<h3>Worried for China</h3>
<p>However, the situation is now going against this, and we are deeply concerned for China. Also, Zhang Pingqun, a member of the Chongqing Executive Yuan, told reporters: "After the war, British aircraft manufacturers are planning to provide China with £10 million worth of goods to develop China's aviation industry." At the same time, Zhang Pingqun added: "Regarding the development of post-war industry, China has extremely abundant natural resources, and human resources are also extremely abundant. However, the lack of capital and technology is recognized by everyone. Therefore, we warmly welcome foreign investment and technical assistance." Just imagine, will China really obtain happiness if the United States, which calls itself a freedom-loving country, wants to turn the happy China into an arsenal? It is worth pondering.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Newspaper Rumors</h3>
<p>According to a dispatch from the Chongqing Central Daily News Anhui Special Correspondent on the 21st, due to the recent air raids and bombings in Shanghai, residents are fleeing in droves. Therefore, strict restrictions have been imposed on trains and vehicles. In fact, the main purpose of the current traffic restrictions in Shanghai is to transport rice and important materials, not to prevent ordinary residents from fleeing.</p>
<h3>Japanese Greater East Asia Ministry Strengthens Advisory System</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency telegram) - Japanese Minister of Greater East Asia Shigemitsu, in order to strengthen the Greater East Asia policy, has decided to enrich the advisory system of the Greater East Asia Ministry. He has decided to hire former Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki Kazuo, former Bank of Japan President Yuki Toyotaro, and Masaatsu Yasuoka as advisors. The announcement was made by the Greater East Asia Ministry on the 25th. Therefore, the current Greater East Asia Ministry advisors, together with the current Supreme Advisor of the National Government Ogura Masatsune, number four in total.</p>
<h3>National Government's Economic Construction Work will See More Rapid Progress, Allied Nation's Huge Loan has Great Significance</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency telegram) - Allied governments, in order to help the National Government Central Reserve Bank's issuance system become sound, loaned 100 million Japanese yen from the Bank of Japan to our Central Reserve Bank in July 1942 to increase the Central Reserve Bank's issuance reserves. As a result, the Central Reserve Bank's reserves have been greatly increased, its credit has been increasing daily, and its circulation has been expanding daily. To date, the Central Reserve Bank notes are the only legal tender in Central China, South China, Huaihai and other places. It has achieved great results in the National Government's financial adjustment and economic construction. Not only that, but also this year, an exchange method for Central Reserve Bank notes with the Joint Reserve Bank has been confirmed, and a centralized remittance system for southern regions has been established with the Yokohama Specie Bank. Therefore, Central Reserve Bank notes have not only become the only credit currency in the country, but have also established its character as a trade currency. This time, the Central Reserve Bank obtained a huge loan of 400 million yuan from the Bank of Japan through the mediation of the Japanese government. This move has great significance for the National Government's decisive battle financial system and the future of Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Therefore, the economic construction work in our country is deeply awaited. Therefore, when the news came out, the whole country was extremely excited, and we cannot help but express our gratitude and excitement for the re-establishment of this huge loan. At a time when the Great East Asia War is entering a decisive stage, the Allied government is still able to provide great assistance to our National Government's wartime financial resources in order to thoroughly implement the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, which we cannot forget and deeply appreciate. Due to the establishment of this huge loan, the future of economic construction in our country will have leaps and bounds of progress, which is predictable. Especially when the price problem has not yet been resolved reasonably, we now have this huge loan, and we feel infinite hope for the future of stabilizing people's livelihoods. At a time when the Great East Asia War is approaching a decisive moment, our country, which bears the important task of defending the rear, will also be more conducive to achieving winning conditions due to the increasing progress of domestic economic construction and the completion of the entire decisive battle economy.</p>
<h3>Financial Authorities Express Deep Gratitude</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency telegram) - Regarding the Bank of Japan's loan to the Central Reserve Bank, the financial authorities issued the following statement: "With the mediation of the Japanese government, the Central Reserve Bank concluded a loan agreement with the Bank of Japan for 400 million Japanese yen, which was completed in Tokyo today. With the establishment of this loan, together with the 100 million Japanese yen signed in the previous year, the total loan to the Central Reserve Bank is 500 million Japanese yen, which will greatly assist the sound development of our country's currency system and the infinite enhancement of the Central Reserve Bank's general credit. We express our deep gratitude to our ally, Japan, for its great support. Since its establishment, the Central Reserve Bank has been developing smoothly. However, in this critical situation, in our country participating in the war, the most urgent task for the central bank is to cooperate with its ally to stabilize finance and maintain currency. Now that we have a loan of 400 million Japanese yen, it is clear that the central banks of China and Japan are closely linked, and the credit of the Central Reserve Bank is enhanced, and the mission it bears will also be achieved. Therefore, the relationship is extremely important. In the future, we must work even harder to ensure that there are no regrets in stabilizing finance and maintaining currency."</p>
<h3>Great Contribution to Stabilizing People's Livelihoods</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency telegram) - After the establishment of a 400 million yuan credit loan between the Central Reserve Bank and the Bank of Japan, people from all walks of life here unanimously expressed their welcome. Especially in the financial sector, it is believed that the value of our country's currency can be further consolidated, thereby making a great contribution to suppressing prices and stabilizing people's livelihoods. On a larger scale, when our country's entire economic system is gradually shifting to a decisive battle system, this assistance can be further promoted. Therefore, the establishment of this new loan of 400 million Japanese yen between the Central Reserve Bank and the Bank of Japan will definitely make a great contribution to the construction of our country's decisive battle economic system. All parties especially firmly believe that after the establishment of this loan, the production increase work and other construction projects that our country is actively working on will have even more rapid development. In this way, it will not only be of great benefit to the national life, but also further exert a strong force in the cooperative completion of the Great East Asia War.</p>
<p>Remarks by the Japanese Embassy Authorities: Regarding the establishment of a 400 million yuan credit loan between the Central Reserve Bank and the Bank of Japan, the authorities of the Japanese Embassy stated on the 25th: The Bank of Japan and the Central Reserve Bank concluded a 400 million Japanese yen credit loan agreement, which has been formally signed by the presidents of the two banks. In the past, the Imperial Government spared no effort to provide all support and cooperation to the Central Reserve Bank, the Central Bank of China, in order to maintain the value of its issued currency and seek its stability. This new credit loan agreement between the two central banks is a concrete manifestation of Japan's consistent policy. It is deeply believed that this will greatly benefit the sound development of the National Government's currency system and the sound progress of the Chinese economy. Therefore, it is also deeply gratifying.</p>

<p>Japanese Army Decides to Support</p>
<p>Great Burma Alliance</p>
<p>Rangoon, 25th (Central News Agency telegram) - 1.6 million Burmese people, under the leadership of Bamo National Representative, formed the Great Burma Alliance. On the 24th, Commander Kawabe issued a statement stating that the entire Japanese dispatched army in Burma will devote all its efforts to support the alliance and jointly complete the war. Zhang Fakui, Commander of the West War Zone, in mid-July, in order to defend Guilin, specially established the Guilin City Defense Headquarters within the Guangxi Pacification Commissioner's Office, and appointed Group Army Deputy Commander Yi Yunqing as Commander. He has now obtained the assistance of the Guilin Air Defense Evacuation Committee to forcibly evacuate citizens, with the assistance of members of the Youth League Wartime Service General Affairs Team. The Chongqing Military Affairs Committee Guangxi Shipping Corps has established offices in Guilin, Wuzhou, Pingle, and other places. The Southwest Import and Export Promotion Committee is also actively evacuating and concentrating materials in Guilin and its vicinity. Many cultural figures have moved to Guilin, and they have repeatedly criticized the political policies of Chongqing, and most citizens resonate with them. The Chongqing inspection authorities, at this time of the Japanese military's sudden advance, are deeply afraid of the people's morale shaking, and are checking citizens' certificates and monitoring the actions of various groups every day. In addition, citizens are strictly prohibited from gathering. Before the Japanese military's attack, the Chongqing military authorities exposed a state of embarrassment, only inviting the ridicule and opposition of the citizens.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Defenses Strengthen Guilin and Forcibly Evacuate Citizens, Deeply Fearing the Southern Advance of Japanese Troops from Hunan</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 25th – The Central Government is extremely concerned about the movements of the Japanese army, believing that the Yuehan Railway will inevitably be opened by the Japanese. Furthermore, they anticipate that the Japanese forces in Hunan will advance southward, and are actively defending Shaoguan, Guilin, and Wuzhou, among other forward outposts. According to recent news from the area, the Japanese military is actively repairing the</p>
<p>Yuehan Railway.</p>
<p>China Frontline Base, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Chongqing army in South China is extremely alarmed by the gradual northward advance of the Japanese army along the Yuehan Railway. They have now evacuated residents along the railway line and are undertaking thorough demolition work. According to Japanese war correspondents, the devastation is indescribable. The railway has no rails, and weeds grow among the sleepers. Approximately 300 to 500 meters of railway line are intermittently destroyed. All bridges have been completely demolished, and there are many places where the embankments have collapsed for ten meters. They are also using natural water flow and rivers to cause further collapse. The Japanese army, however, is overcoming all difficulties, working day and night to repair the damaged locations and actively developing emergency highways. On the other hand, the Guangdong Provincial Government has established work teams to cooperate with the Japanese army. Along the railway line, each village is selecting fifty to one hundred people to engage in this restoration work. The highway south of Yuantan has already been completed for many years. Local residents, who have never seen cars before, are now joyfully helping the Japanese army build the railway.</p>
<p>Kyoto Labor Camp Holds Demobilization Ceremony</p>
<p>Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Since the New National Movement Youth Summer Labor Service Camp began camping at Qingliang Temple on the 23rd, all the participants have been very enthusiastic.

The camping schedule is scheduled to end today, and a demobilization ceremony will be held in the afternoon, presided over by Camp Commander Lin to show solemnity.</p>
<h3>Chongqing and Communist Opinions Diverge, Cooperation Unlikely, America Aims to Use China as the Decisive Battleground</h3>
<p>A Certain Base on the Central China Frontline, 25th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The struggle between Chongqing and Yan'an, which has been undergoing adjustment, has progressed from preliminary negotiations in Xi'an to formal meetings in Chongqing. During these meetings, despite fervent support from anti-Axis powers and the encouragement of U.S. Vice President Wallace, the opposition between the two sides' demands has not been resolved. This meeting aimed to resolve the various incidents that have occurred between Chongqing and Yan'an since the Anhui Incident last summer, in order to restore the cooperation between the two sides at the beginning of the war of resistance. However, due to the vast differences in their political demands, and because the proposals made during the talks were all</p>
<p>fundamental issues</p>
<p>from the past, no matter how much Chongqing concedes, cooperation is unlikely until the Yan'an regime is denied. However, the anti-Axis countries also believe that this responsibility should be shouldered by Chongqing. Magazines such as Moscow's "War and the Working Class" and British Communist newspapers have criticized Chongqing's encirclement of Yan'an. The New York Times has also published Yan'an's attacks on Chongqing's one-party rule, considering it far removed from democracy. Therefore, Chongqing is in a difficult situation under American pressure and Yan'an's attacks. On the other hand, Yan'an's closeness to the United States also serves as a kind of check on Chongqing. America's ambition is nothing more than to sacrifice China to achieve its aim of fighting Japan. In insisting on resistance to develop China's</p>
<p>red revolution,</p>
<p>the two sides have the same goal, making cooperation easy. Furthermore, Yan'an's political theory is New Democracy, which has common ground with European and American democracy. Moreover, the recent direct request for air bases by the U.S. Air Force is the biggest reason for the easier approach between the two sides. It is an established policy for the United States to use the Chinese mainland as a base to bomb the Japanese mainland. The Twentieth Air Force, based in Chengdu, has launched four raids on Japan. Recently, due to the defeat in the Hunan campaign, the U.S. Air Force stationed in South China has had to retreat, which makes the need to establish bases in inland China and the Northwest region more acute. Now, a U.S. military inspection group composed of U.S. officers and military experts arrived in</p>
<p>Yan'an</p>
<p>on the 12th of this month.</p>
<p>Regarding the purpose of the inspection group, a Chongqing spokesman said at a meeting that it was to seek cooperation in assisting injured U.S. soldiers who had been forced to land, and to collect meteorological and other information. As for whether the Yan'an area will be used as a base for air strikes against Japan, it is not yet possible to say. The construction of new bases in the Northwest region is a fixed plan for Yan'an. At the same time, since the United States intends to bomb Manchuria, it is conceivable that it will seek bases in northern Shaanxi.</p>

<p>A Certain Japanese Military Base, 25th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – A U.S. Air Force B29 aircraft stationed in Chongqing crashed in Huduo Town (28 kilometers west of Sucheng, Jiangsu Province) at approximately 10:00 PM on the 20th. The wreckage has been recovered by the local Japanese army. By investigating its direction of flight and airframe, it can be presumed that the aircraft was shot down by Japanese defense forces during the air raid on northern Kyushu on the 20th, and crashed in the area while flying back to China due to damage to its components.</p>
<p>Hangzhou Air Defense Conference</p>
<p>Hangzhou, 25th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Hangzhou Air Defense Office held its first air defense conference in the City Hall meeting room yesterday to discuss air defense matters. It was decided to strengthen lighting control and enhance air defense equipment.</p>
<h3>Major Battle Underway in Southwest Suburbs of Paris, Invading Forces Advance Along the Yonne River</h3>
<p>Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The German News Agency quoted an official German war report stating that, in the northwest region of Paris, the enemy is pursuing the German army retreating down the Seine River with powerful forces from the southwest. The enemy is exerting strong pressure south of Elbeuf. West of Paris, the enemy, supported by numerous tanks, has advanced to the western suburbs of the city. Fierce fighting is currently taking place in the suburbs. During a counterattack, the German army repelled enemy forces attempting to cross the Yonne River west of Melun (southeast of Paris).</p>
<p>Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The German News Agency reports that extremely fierce fighting continues in Normandy, one of its characteristics being the bravery displayed by German soldiers, which even the enemy acknowledges. The fighting in this part of France seems to have been divided into individual actions by fast-moving tank formations, but in general, the war has spread to major areas. German grenadiers are bravely resisting, regardless of the anti-Axis forces' numerical superiority, because German soldiers believe they are fighting for a just cause and the future of the nation, so they will do their utmost to achieve this goal. German formations, closely followed by anti-Axis forces, are struggling to maintain the general line from Lisieux to Orbec and on to Conches. This line runs from Conches to Evreux and Pacy and ends at Vernon. West of Evreux, U.S. forces have broken through northwards from Bonneville and reached the southeast of Le Neubourg. On Wednesday, anti-Axis aircraft bombed the small town of Conches eight times in a short period of time, showing that Anglo-American forces will soon continue to attack the area. In the Paris area, U.S. forces have so far only used tank reconnaissance units to explore the German lines, and the German army is engaged in fierce fighting with terrorists west and southwest of Paris. South of the capital, the German rear guard has retreated to the Corbeil-Fontainebleau line. The situation near Romilly and Toryes on the Yonne River (south of Paris) is not yet clear. General Patton, who is directing operations there, seems to aim to encircle the German forces south of Paris and east of the Seine, or to cut off all German communications with southern France.</p>
<p>German Troops Retreating to Lyon from Southern France</p>
<p>Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The German News Agency reports that there is fierce fighting in the Toulon and Marseille areas of southern France. The German army has retreated to Lyon from several locations under the cover of coastal artillery, disengaging from the enemy.</p>
<h3>Romanian National Socialist Government Calls on Military and Civilians to Continue Resistance, Denounces the Treacherous Behavior of the King</h3>
<p>Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Haitong News Agency reports that the Romanian National Socialist Party government has been declared to be formed as necessitated by the situation. The Romanian King has formed a left-wing government and notified the military and civilians of the country to cease hostilities against the Soviet Union. The National Socialist government issued a hasty announcement, informing the Romanian military and civilians, which reads: "Romanians, the lives of us and our descendants, and the destiny of Romania, have reached a state of extreme danger. The brave Romanian military and civilians have shed blood for the soil of both countries for the past few years. Now the King, surrounded by treacherous villains, has dismissed our leader Marshal Antonescu and shamelessly allied himself with our enemies, handing Romania over to our deadly enemy, the communists. Although Britain and the United States guarantee Romania's independence and integrity, these are lies. They have long allowed Stalin to dominate Romanian territory. The King, in an attempt to seek protection from Britain and the United States, has completely forfeited the fate of the country and the future of the people. The King has prepared an aircraft to leave at any time. The King's treasonous behavior has harmed Romania and its people. Fortunately, the National Socialist government has now been formed, in order to preserve our ancestral Romanian territory and prevent it from being taken over by the communists." The announcement also encourages the military and civilians not to obey the orders of the King and his government, and urges soldiers to fight to defend the country.</p>
<p>German Troops in Romania Shifting the Frontline Back</p>
<p>Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The German News Agency reports that the situation in the southern sector of the Eastern Front has been affected by the attitude of the Romanian army. Initially, the pro-Royal party was preparing to rebel before the Soviet army launched a major offensive. When the Soviet army attempted to break through the Axis forces' positions with a large force, some Romanian troops offered only slight resistance, while others continued to fight vigorously. According to well-informed sources, the German side is dealing with the current situation with a calm head. The German army has shifted its positions on both sides of the Prut River and in the middle reaches of the Siret River, and is now defending the natural defensive line to the west.</p>
<p>Hungary Orders the Dissolution of All Political Parties</p>
<p>Budapest, 25th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Hungarian government ordered on the 24th that all political parties in the country, regardless of their political orientation, should be dissolved immediately, cease all political activities, and all assets of political parties should be frozen or confiscated. Violators of the ban will be severely punished.</p>
<p>Budapest, 25th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Haitong News Agency reports that the purpose of the Hungarian government's order to ban political party activities is to safeguard domestic unity.</p>
<p>Nanjing Briefs</p>
<p>Rural Sketches of the Four Suburbs of Nanjing – Min Xian</p>
<p>A reporter and his party braved the summer heat for several days to visit rural areas such as Badou Mountain, Dashengguan, Xiaolingwei, Zijin Mountain, and Xiaohang Mountain, to conduct separate inspections. A detailed report on the overall picture of the rural areas on the outskirts of the capital is being compiled. Only the external circumstances of various places are reported in advance. It is hoped that it can attract the attention of the authorities to the revival of the rural economy.</p>
<p>First, Security – Because all the rural areas traversed are not far from the capital, there are not many unreasonable special circumstances, especially few activities of bandits and communists. The lives of the farmers in each village are relatively stable. However, in the villages on the outskirts, local soldiers often forcibly buy "or even forcibly demand" firewood and grass to bring into the city for profit (currently, the price of firewood and grass in Nanjing is about six or seven hundred yuan per load). It is inevitable that other farming families feel disturbed. It is heard that the authorities have repeatedly issued orders to ban this, but those who speak are unheeded. If you want to stabilize the countryside, it seems appropriate to start with small things and actually remedy them.</p>
<p>Urgent Need for Guidance – In recent years, the authorities have loudly called for the revival of the countryside and promoted increased production. We, who have been living in the city for a long time, cannot help but be moved by the grand speeches and great theories in the newspapers. However, in terms of improvement, it is feared that it will be difficult to achieve results if the countryside is not given practical guidance. For example, in the Yanziji district, which is very close to Nanjing, about 30 mu of land in the 4th and 5th bao are planted with pomegranates. The reporter saw rotten pomegranates discarded on the ground, and the pests on the trees were also gathering and no one was driving them away. It can be seen that the cultivation method is not scientific. When consulting a wealthy local farmer, he replied: "Most of these pomegranate trees have owners, and everyone just wants to be able to collect a little each year, and that's it." During the busy autumn harvest season, farmers are threshing rice in the fields using outdated methods, so although there are many rice beds, it is difficult to achieve twice the result with half the effort. During a break, I learned that there are also certain grassroots organizations here. The expenses are borne by the villagers according to household, and the right is to enjoy the allocation paper for daily necessities and technical guidance on agricultural products, but in fact, it is only a formality, and the allocation of goods is one in a hundred. In particular, the so-called agricultural instructor is a young man from a normal school. Although his hard work is admirable, his knowledge of agricultural science seems to be lacking, and it is clear that he cannot guide others. From this, we can further know that it seems insufficient for experts who only care about the countryside in the city to only summon meetings and shout for increased production. They must have real talent and practical knowledge, and experts who have a good understanding of the rural economy must go deep into the countryside, prescribe the right medicine, and actually guide the improvement of crops, and help them with materials, so that the potential of the countryside and the semi-barren land can be fully realized, and the effect of increasing production can be achieved. It is difficult to achieve success without this.</p>
<p>Lack of Cattle – Very few farmers in the villages own cattle. It is rare to have three or four cattle in each village. From this, it can be clear that the average farmer is not rich, and the rich are only a few large landowners. Farmers who need cattle to help with their work must rent them from the landlords, and the price is as high as 2,000 yuan per mu. Therefore, semi-self-cultivating farmers and those who have no strength are exploited everywhere. They still have difficulty getting enough to eat on weekdays, and they have no money to see a doctor when they are sick. The so-called "big fish eat small fish" also exists in the countryside. What is especially heartbreaking is that a few families with cattle sell the only cattle they have to get through their current difficulties, but the number of cattle is gradually decreasing, and the authorities have not taken strict measures to treat the symptoms, and there are very few agricultural loans to treat the root cause. If this continues, cattle will disappear from the countryside, which is not an exaggeration.</p>
<p>Superficial Prosperity – In the villages and towns that the reporter passed through, there are actually many modern luxury goods, colorful and all-inclusive. Those who enjoy them are either large landowners or special people with special power in the local area. The average farmer can't even dream of it. People in the city always think that food prices are high and farmers are rich, and deeply sigh that the city is not as good as the countryside. In fact, although the high price of rice is a fact, after repeated exploitation, the benefits that farmers get are minimal. In particular, most tenant farmers groan under high interest rates. "If you borrow 1,000 yuan, you have to pay back a load of wheat in addition to the principal after four or five months, which is worth 1,800 yuan." Similarly, farmers are sighing that the countryside is not as good as the city.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Area Edible Oil Management Essentials, Oil and Grain Association Formulates Measures and Submits for Implementation</h3>
<p>The Business Control Commission's Oil and Grain Control Committee, in order to prevent hoarding of edible oil within the Shanghai control line, has formulated interim management measures and submitted them to the Business Control Commission and the Shanghai Special Municipal Government for promulgation and implementation in the near future. Details of the contents of the measures have been learned as follows:</p>
<p>Manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers, and buyers of edible oil must register with the guild, and all stocks must be sold within a limited time, otherwise they will be penalized. Manufacturers must register the warehouse receipts issued to wholesalers and retailers with the guild, sell them within a limited time, and have them stamped by the Oil and Grain Control Committee to be valid. Manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers may not store more edible oil than their usual actual sales volume. For business use, the amount of edible oil stored by each company is also limited to a certain amount according to the needs of the industry. The amount of edible oil stored by companies, factories, groups, organizations, and households should be determined according to the number of people in the household and the actual amount needed. To prevent non-industry people from operating the edible oil transportation within the control line, if the quantity exceeds the specified amount, there must be a purchase and sale registration certificate from the guild. Members with the same qualifications may not buy or sell from each other, or operate or store on behalf of others, etc. However, this restriction does not apply to purchasers who transport from outside the local area. If the provisions of these measures are violated, or if there are any concealment or false reports, once verified, the committee may purchase at the designated price, or send a letter to the competent authority to impose penalties depending on the severity of the circumstances.</p>
<h3>Strictly Enforcing National Banquets, Prohibiting Taoist Rituals</h3>
<p>Under the wartime system, it is particularly urgent to save on extravagance and prevent the waste of resources. The Municipal Social Welfare Bureau and the Municipal Thrift Association attach great importance to this. Recently, in order to strictly enforce national banquets, assist in promoting electricity conservation measures, and prohibit superstitious behaviors such as holding Taoist rituals, they jointly convened hotel, restaurant, Chinese and Western restaurants, and district chief representatives in the city yesterday (25th) at 3:00 PM and 5:00 PM respectively in the conference room of the Welfare Bureau for talks. Minister of Social Welfare Ding Mocun personally delivered instructions. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Past Malpractices and Attempts to Conceal – At 3:00 PM, representatives of hotels, restaurants, and Chinese and Western restaurants in the city were convened to discuss the strict enforcement of thrift banquets and the promotion of electricity conservation measures. The representatives present, including Minister Ding, Director Sun Mingqi, Director Chen Dongbai, and Thrift Association Director Pei Qing, have been holding meetings for two months, but the effectiveness of the implementation has not been strictly checked. In the aspects of various industries, due to the needs of guests, they even use various methods to evade restrictions, attempting to cleverly conceal, which violates the principles of thrift. It is hoped that they will strictly abide by the rules. If the cost of raw materials rises sharply, they can also make a reasonable application to adjust the publicly announced price. The authorities will absolutely take care of the difficulties of businesses. At the same time, inspections will be carried out in the future. If any violations are found, they will be severely punished. It is hoped that all industries will voluntarily abide by the rules.</p>
<h3>Strictly Enforcing Thrift, Implementing Inspections</h3>
<p>The Executive Director of the Thrift Association, Lu Feng, gave a speech, saying: "I hope to actively and automatically promote thrift measures. If Shanghai cannot implement thrift measures, it will have a significant impact on the country and the nation. Under this wartime system, it is inevitable to promote national banquets and prevent waste. High-end dishes and extravagant competitions will affect general prices, making ordinary people suffer from the pressure of high living costs. I hope that all parties will assist the government in strictly enforcing thrift and avoiding various illegal malpractices." The Director of the Thrift Association, Ren Yunpeng, continued to speak, pointing out phenomena such as the thriving of card games in hotels and the abnormal bustle in restaurants, where various industries cater to customers and do not hesitate to evade restrictions and other fraudulent behaviors in clever ways. He also announced the promotion measures for thrift banquets, and in the future, they will send young students to cooperate with the restaurant and other industries to carry out inspections, in order to complete the restriction of national banquets as soon as possible. Subsequently, the Executive Director of the Thrift Association, Gu Nanqun, gave a speech, hoping that all industries themselves would thoroughly understand the task of thrift. In the future, they should also cooperate sincerely in the inspection work and assist the government in promoting it. Later, representatives of the hotel industry, Ding Sheng, and representatives of the Chinese and Western restaurant industry, Wu Bingyong, spoke successively, expressing their approval of the strict enforcement of thrift banquets and electricity conservation measures, and decided to cooperate and maintain them. However, they requested the welfare authorities to assist in informing the market and lowering the wholesale prices for the purchase of raw materials.</p>
<h3>Official-Private Cooperation, Protecting Resources</h3>
<p>Minister Ding's instructions were as follows: "Regarding electricity conservation, the power company has always strictly implemented it, and you are all enthusiastic about complying with it, so there is no need to explain it further. However, regarding thrift banquets, I would like to take this opportunity to clarify: the restriction of national banquets is advocated by the Welfare Department. It is by no means an official interference with the freedom of business operations. At this time of material shortages, the situation is becoming increasingly serious. If we do not economize, economic and price difficulties will increase in the future, and the excessive consumption of resources will not only hit people's livelihoods but also greatly damage the nation's vitality. Furthermore, due to the difficulty of transportation and the difficulty of material circulation, it is hoped that by reducing consumption, prices will tend to fall. In short, thrift is based on protecting resources. I hope you will understand this and cooperate and promote it in accordance with the regulations. The inspection personnel sent in the future have also been approved by the government authorities. They will closely cooperate in the same position to achieve success." Finally, Executive Director Gu expressed his deep gratitude for the enthusiastic participation of all industries and the personal instructions of Minister Ding. The meeting lasted for two hours.</p>
<h3>Breaking Superstition, Strictly Prohibiting Taoist Rituals</h3>
<p>At 5:00 PM, a talk was started with the district chiefs. The district chiefs present included Zhu Qizhen, Xu Xiaochu, Zhou Mengbai, Le Fenglin, and Yao Jiangzhang. First, Minister Ding explained the significance of promoting thrift work and relying on the cooperation of the Baojia system, and stated that superstitious customs such as holding Taoist rituals have not been completely broken to this day. These superstitious behaviors not only cost people money, but also cause even greater losses of resources, and create opportunities for hooligans and local diseases to defraud money. He hoped that the Baojia districts would automatically persuade the people and cooperate in prohibiting them, which would be of great benefit to individuals, society, the country, and the nation. After Director Sun gave a speech, Baojia representative Zhou Mengbai expressed his views, expressing his approval of the ban on Taoist rituals and superstition. Then, the entire meeting unanimously decided to prohibit them completely. The method is to first have the district chiefs persuade the people in the district to prohibit them, and the Welfare Bureau and the Thrift Association will separately send letters to the city's police bureau and the Baojia office to instruct their subordinates to strictly prohibit them. The meeting ended at 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Order at the North Station Has Improved</h3>
<p>Since the police affairs of the North Station in the city have been taken over by the Xihongkou Branch of the Municipal Police Bureau, the situation is still good. The maintenance of order inside and outside the station has been actively improved by the additional deployment of long-term police officers by the branch. In particular, the customary search inside the station has been prohibited. Regardless of large or small packages, they must not be inspected on the pretext of preventing malpractices. As for the black market ticket sales, since the China Railway Company formulated a new ticket purchase method, it has been reduced. The so-called "scalpers" who have always made a living from selling black market tickets are becoming increasingly depressed. In general, the situation can be said to be satisfactory.</p>
<h3>Completed Consolidated Tax Goods - Exemption from Transit Tax - Customs Administration Submits to Ministry of Finance for Record</h3>
<p>Regarding goods subject to consolidated tax, tobacco and alcohol tax, or mineral tax, the customs authorities have always relied on tax payment receipts for verification and release. However, the collection or exemption of transit tax has not been consistent. Therefore, the Inspector General of Customs has submitted a proposal to the Customs Administration suggesting that all goods for which the respective taxes have been paid should be exempted from transit tax. The Ministry of Finance has reviewed the Administration's request and has now issued an order approving it for record and instructing notification. The original text is as follows: "According to the Customs Administration's submission of July 3, based on the submission of Aimoto Hirokichi, Inspector General of Customs, regarding goods subject to consolidated tax, tobacco and alcohol tax, or mineral tax, the customs authorities have always relied on tax payment receipts for verification and release. However, the collection or exemption of transit tax has not been consistent. It is now proposed that all goods for which the respective taxes have been paid should be exempted from transit tax. The reasons are respectfully submitted as follows: Consolidated Tax Goods: It has been found that consolidated tax goods, such as bran, wheat flour, rolled tobacco, smoked tobacco leaves, cement, matches, spirits, cotton yarn, and directly woven products, have been ordered to be subject to transit tax. However, for beer, except for those produced by breweries specifically exempted, the remaining products that have already paid the consolidated tax are still required to pay transit tax, resulting in inconsistent treatment. To ensure fair taxation and simplify customs procedures, it seems appropriate to improve this. All beer that has paid consolidated tax should be exempted from transit tax upon presentation of the tax payment receipt. Tobacco and Alcohol Tax (Special Tax on Native Tobacco Industry, Fixed Tax on Native Wine, and Tax on Foreign Wines): It has been found that tobacco and alcohol tax goods, such as native wine, native tobacco leaves, and shredded tobacco, have been ordered to be exempted from transit tax. However, for foreign wines, the scope of transit tax exemption is limited to products specifically approved for exemption from the breweries. This also seems unfair. The method of transit tax exemption for these tobacco and alcohol tax goods (including special tax on native tobacco leaves, fixed tax on native wine, and tax on foreign wines) should be handled in the same way as consolidated tax goods, with transit tax exemption granted upon presentation of the tobacco and alcohol tax payment receipt. Mineral Tax Goods: It has been found that mineral tax goods have previously been repeatedly ordered to be issued a list of mineral names and tax amounts. For all products listed, if they have a mineral tax payment receipt, the customs authorities have consistently followed the regulations of the Administration's Instruction No. 18115 of September 27, 1935, to exempt them from transit tax. Other products should also be treated uniformly, with transit tax exemption granted upon presentation of the mineral tax payment receipt. The proposed plan is that all goods that have paid consolidated tax, tobacco and alcohol tax, or mineral tax should be exempted from transit tax. To determine whether the reasons are sufficient, a list of cases of special exemptions for beer and foreign wines and various mineral tax cases, along with copies of the original orders, are respectfully submitted for review," and so on, with an attached list and copies of fourteen orders. Based on this review, the methods for transit tax exemption for goods that have paid consolidated tax, tobacco and alcohol tax, or mineral tax have been inconsistent, leading to disputes and misunderstandings. This time, a unified method is established to create a fixed rule so that everyone can follow it. After checking, there are no discrepancies. In addition to instructing approval, this document, along with the attached documents, is respectfully submitted for review." The Ministry has approved the request for record, instructing notification and dissemination."</p>
<h3>Knowledge of Air Raid Defense - Meaning of Air Raid Defense</h3>
<p>Currently, some people still have doubts about whether air raids are truly unavoidable. However, the fact is that enemy planes have already attacked and may do so again in the future. However, if citizens adopt complete measures for air defense, even the largest enemy air raid will not be effective. Germany is a clear example of this. Conversely, if citizens lack preparation, they will inevitably suffer significant losses from enemy air raids. Therefore, it is crucial to recognize that a dismissive attitude plays into the enemy's hands. In essence, the purpose of defense is not about when enemy planes will come, but about creating a system that renders their attacks ineffective. Thoughts on Air Raids When a bomb explodes nearby or incendiary bombs fall everywhere, a fire can easily start if action is delayed. In this situation, anyone can easily panic. However, if one is well-prepared and trained for air raids in peacetime, one will not be thrown into chaos even when enemy planes drop bombs. Secondly, it should be noted that during air raids, some people will be exploited by various rumors and become even more flustered. After an air raid, when the situation is still not public and the situation is unclear, various rumors are likely to spread. These absurd rumors can be extremely outrageous. At this time, it is important to remain calm, not be swayed by them, and trust the authorities' instructions, so that order can be maintained. In emergency situations, chaos often arises from the abnormal behavior of citizens. The authorities must consider the overall situation and instruct and guide the general public with the most appropriate strategies. However, in such situations, if citizens act arbitrarily, the chaos will only worsen. In order to minimize casualties in such situations, the authorities have been studying and preparing to enable citizens to continue their work as usual. Therefore, citizens have an absolute obligation to trust the authorities' guidance, as this is the safest approach.</p>
<h3>Courts to Handle Cases Swiftly - Agreed Upon Methods</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Local Procuratorate recently received an order from the Ministry instructing it to consult with the High Procuratorate and the High and District Courts to improve and simplify case handling procedures, ensuring speed and preventing delays, so as to avoid prolonged detention of the accused. The Chief Procurator, Zhao Zhengtang, convened an ad hoc meeting of all procurators. The main items discussed included:</p>
<p>(A) How to allocate cases submitted by the police after the summer break. (Resolution) The rotating daily assignment method of July and August will continue. Two procurators will be assigned to allocate cases received on that day. However, if the number of cases exceeds forty, the Chief Procurator will temporarily assign additional personnel to handle them. If the number of cases is less than twenty, only one procurator will handle them. Complaint cases will continue to be divided equally as usual. The above method will be implemented from September 1.</p>
<p>(B) The resolution of the Procuratorate's meeting on June 27 of this year regarding the vigorous implementation of bail must be strictly followed. (Resolution) To be implemented as directed.</p>
<p>(C) After the summer break, it is proposed that the police be requested to submit cases daily by 10:00 AM to expedite the process. (Resolution) To be requested of the police.</p>
<p>(D) In the future, requests for case files and other matters from the police should be sent directly to the sub-bureaus, rather than to the main bureau, to avoid delays due to back-and-forth communication. (Resolution) To be implemented as directed. Director of Public Health on</p>
<h3>Measures to Combat Smoking</h3>
<p>Lu Runzhi, Director of the Public Health Administration, came to Shanghai the other day on official business. The main purpose of his visit was to instruct on the establishment of smoking cessation hospitals in Shanghai and various public health implementation policies. Yesterday, a reporter from the Central News Agency interviewed Mr. Lu to inquire about the implementation policies of smoking cessation hospitals across the country. He kindly made the following remarks: Since the Central Government promulgated the anti-drug laws, the Administration has also been ordered to prepare for the establishment of smoking cessation hospitals across the country. Preparations began in May of this year, starting with the establishment of the Capital Smoking Cessation Hospital. The Shanghai branch was established the other day. In other provinces, it is planned to establish five Class A smoking cessation hospitals in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, located in Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Suzhou, Wuhu, and Bengbu, ten Class B hospitals located in Changshu, Wuxi, Wutong, Zhenjiang, Taixian, Nantong, Kunshan, Songjiang, Ningbo, and Huaining, and seventeen Class C hospitals located in Jiangpu, Jiangning, Taicang, Kunshan, Wujiang, Yixing, Xinghua, Gaoyou, Dongtai, Gaocheng, Rugao, Haimen, Qingpu, Wuxing, Shaoxing, Hefei, and Jiashan. The total expenses are set at 500,000 yuan per month for Class A, 300,000 yuan for Class B, and 200,000 yuan for Class C, all allocated by the Public Health Administration for preparation. The local anti-smoking bureaus will first investigate the situation of suitable hospitals in their areas, and then organize a board of directors to start preparing for the establishment of the smoking cessation hospital. The Administration will separately appoint specialized personnel to manage the hospital and operate it in accordance with the methods stipulated by the Administration. Regarding the methods for smokers to quit, there are three types: persuasion, forced cessation, and voluntary cessation. Diagnostic fees will be determined with reference to local conditions. During the period when smokers are undergoing cessation, their relatives must personally supervise them, striving to thoroughly eliminate drug use within three years in accordance with the anti-smoking measures stipulated by the Central Government.</p>
<p>"New Interpretation of Mencius" to Be Published Zhao Zhengping, President of National Shanghai University, has recently authored a book titled "New Interpretation of Mencius." Based on the author's sharp and precise scientific methods, the book provides a detailed analysis of Mencius's teachings and elaborates on Mencius's concepts of benevolence and righteousness, democracy, and ideas on people's livelihood, people's happiness, people's opinions, anti-war sentiments, and personal cultivation. The entire book consists of twelve lectures, totaling over 100,000 words. It has now been typeset and is expected to be published at the end of this month.</p>
<p>Xingren Real Estate Shares to Be Listed The Xingren Real Estate Company on Fuzhou Road in this city was founded by Shen Changfu, Zhang Weiru, Xiao Xiling, Song Boquan, and others, with a capital of 10 million yuan in national currency. It specializes in real estate sales and architectural design, employing experts to oversee all aspects. Last year, it purchased hundreds of acres of vacant land and has been operating very smoothly. The company's shares, priced at ten yuan each, will be listed soon.</p>
<p>Simaito Brand Socks Listed The Tongxing Socks and Shirts Factory (i.e., Tongxing Industrial Society) in this city was founded by Xu Zhichao. Last year, it expanded its capital to 20 million yuan. Its Simaito brand horizontal striped socks for men and women have recently been launched on the market. The factory actively emphasizes both manual and machine production to meet demand. The factory's new shares have been available for exchange since August 25.</p>
<h3>Readers' Scholarship Aid News - Who is Not as Good as Me in Doing Good? - Mr. Zhu Shouzhi's Fundraising</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhu Shouzhi, deeply concerned about the suffering of impoverished students who are unable to attend school, previously sent Mr. Guo Yongxi to the library to review the applications of those not admitted to high school and university. He carefully reviewed each application and selected five of the most impoverished high school seniors and university freshmen, requesting approval to provide them with a scholarship of 50,000 yuan, funded solely by Mr. Zhu, as previously reported. Subsequently, Mr. Zhu raised another 50,000 yuan each from the Yuhua Tobacco Factory and the Xinya Rubber Printing Factory, totaling 100,000 yuan. In the second selection, ten rejected university students were selected, each receiving 6,000 yuan, and ten high school students were also selected, each receiving 4,000 yuan, totaling 100,000 yuan. Mr. Zhu's benevolence and righteousness are truly rare. According to Mr. Zhu, there are wealthy tycoons and merchants everywhere in Shanghai. We only need to promote it sincerely, and it will not be difficult to raise large sums of money. As the saying goes, "Who is not as good as me in doing good?" These words are truly profound. We at this newspaper hope that our readers will emulate Mr. Zhu's spirit of generosity and promote it widely, contributing efforts and money to benefit both others and themselves, which is truly immeasurable merit. Cheng Yi Students' Enthusiasm is Commendable The students of Cheng Yi Middle School at 694 Taishan Road have been performing plays to raise funds, as detailed in previous reports in this newspaper. The faculty and staff of the school have wholeheartedly led the students in this charitable endeavor, which is commendable. Yesterday, they sent the net proceeds of the charity performance, totaling over 107,000 yuan, as follows: Student fundraising: 146,500 yuan Temporary donations: 4,200 yuan Sales of brochures: 965 yuan Total income: 151,665 yuan Expenses: 44,428.7 yuan Net income: 107,236.3 yuan.</p>
<p>Also, starting at noon on the 19th of this month, a special honorary seat invitation will be presented for every donation of 1,000 yuan or more, totaling 55 invitations.</p>
<p>The Buddhist Association Notifies Benevolent Men and Women The Shanghai Shenbao Newspaper relays that all Shanghai residents who are ignorant and rebellious, only know how to seek individual blessings, but do not know how to benefit society and repay the kindness of all living beings, which is the supreme field of merit. Educating young people and building the foundation of the country is the most excellent wisdom. If things are allowed to continue in this way, the Dharma will become increasingly obscure, and people will only engage in empty formalities, without focusing on practical work to save lives. This is far from the compassion and wisdom of the Buddha, and it causes those who believe in Buddhism to be seen as superstitious and passive. Upon investigation, the cause is that Buddhists are reaping what they sow. In fact, what the Buddha taught people is to lead them to the path of light and happiness in life, always putting the benefit of others as the prerequisite, with great compassion, great courage, great wisdom, and great vows. The twelve divisions of the scriptures reveal this to the disciples. Over time, falsehoods accumulate and distort the truth. Those who leave home do not promote the teachings, and lay believers also lose their true meaning. If Buddhists are ignorant of the path, the world will sink deeper into suffering, and the consequences in the future will be unimaginable. The heart of Bodhi arises from suffering, so today, the Association is taking the lead for our fellow Buddhists to respond to the scholarship and loan programs of the Shenbao and Xinbao newspapers, collecting a total of 112,500 yuan from the food rations and savings of various temples in Shanghai, and donating all of it in the hope that Buddhist believers will strive to rescue young people who have dropped out of school, embodying the spirit of great compassion, courage, wisdom, and vows, benefiting the future society, purifying the small self, and strengthening the great self. In terms of merit, this is greater than anything else. It is believed that among our Buddhists, there is no shortage of wise and wealthy elders, or powerful lay people who, with one call, will be answered by all. People's hope that their children will be educated and become talents is no different from their own hope, but due to actual economic conditions, they have to bear the sadness of young people dropping out of school. Preparing talents for the country is the same for everyone. Following the Buddha's heart, they should be brave and do what is right. The members of the Association directly express their humble feelings, striking Ananda's begging bowl and praising the generosity of the benefactors. Shanghai Special City Buddhist Association.</p>
