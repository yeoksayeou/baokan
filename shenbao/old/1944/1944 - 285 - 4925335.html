<h3>決戰的前夕</h3>
<p>問：這次敵美空襲台灣，截至目前止，戰況如何，請聞其詳。　　答：關於敵機空襲台灣，戰況已分見連日報載日本大本營發表消息。此次敵機自十二日晨開始空襲，盟邦航空部隊立即迎擊，並搜覔敵機出發地及敵方機動部隊所在地，結果在台灣東方海面發現敵艦隊，施以反覆猛襲，迄目前止已經擊沉筆方航空母艦七艘，驅逐艦一艘，擊毀航空母艦二艘，戰艦一艘，巡洋艦一艘，不明艦型者十一艘。現尚在追蹤攻擊中。　　問：從敵軍此次出動的海空軍和量以觀，似乎已是大規模的孤注一擲吧！　　答：敵機出動三千架，襲擊台灣全土，規模之大，確爲大東亞戰爭以來第一次。敵方作戰艦隊係海爾賽統率之太平洋第三艦隊，亦即五十八機動部隊。同時，敵在太平洋艦隊中最有力之精銳，完全集中於這一個機動部隊。所以，這次戰役，已可視爲決戰的序幕。因此，盟邦航空部隊並不以應戰敵機爲重要，而以搜索發現敵方機動部隊所在地爲主要任務，待發現以後，傾力給予致命打擊，俾根本撲滅敵方太平洋主力。根據這一目標，盟邦海陸軍一致協力搜覔，從所獲戰果以觀，已經完成局部任務。其次，敵機出動三千架之多，因此機動部隊不能遠離，不過採輸形陣左右出沒，企圖規避日軍搜索目標。但日軍不斷搜索，結果終難逃遁，所以，從此可知敵方機動部隊之完全消滅，已爲確定之命運了。　　問：這樣說來，敵方此次軍事行動，無異飛蛾投火，自取覆滅嗎？　　答：誠然，敵方此舉，顯係冒險一逞。不過，敵美決定此種行動，是有計劃，有策略的。因爲台灣是日本最大的要賽，日本本土在東，中國大陸在西，菲律賓在南，日本在此建有最強大的空軍力，所以，敵方利用三千架飛機空襲的暴力，企圖一次擊潰日本在台灣的空軍力，取得制空權，然後進行菲律賓攻奪戰，以至西可解除中國大陸戰之厄，東向日本本土空襲。然而，盟邦日本早有萬全準備，敵美縱以更大的兵力，也必覆滅，何況，這次敵軍已用最精銳的主力出動，即受致命打擊，則再衰三竭，爲期不遠了。　　問：然則，敵美不惜傾力一逞，其動機究竟仍在？戰局前途的趨勢又何如呢？　　答：敵美這次傾力作戰，第一，無非羅斯福爲競選四屆總統，企圖冒險獲得戰勝消息以博國民心響。第二，敵國國民厭戰心理普遍發展，不得不冒險以戰勝消息挽回人心。現在已有事實證明羅斯福冒險戰略的失敗。我們從這次台灣戰役的意義更可注意幾點：第一，敵美國內自誇軍力雄厚，並肆詆日本空軍力量的單薄，現已不攻自破。第二，敵美對於截斷日本本土與南方諸地的聯絡，看得極易，但現在已知相當困難了。同時，接近中國大陸的企圖，雖不能完全粉碎，但巳給敵方感覺是做不到的。第三，羅斯福擬以戰果爲四選成功的企圖，現在打破，羅斯福四選如能成功，美國國民必將更多更大的流血。第四，過去塞班，迭尼安，大宮島等之小勝，敵美振詞欺世，以爲日本軍力低能，現已證明敵美過去宣傳之完全虛僞。</p>
<h3>日海軍精銳出動台灣東敵艦被殲連日來沉毀共達二十三艘</h3>
<p>東京十五日中央社電　日本大本營十五日下午三時發表：台灣東方海面之敵機動部隊，自十四日以來，連日正向東方敗退，日本軍部隊對此會反覆加以猛攻，刻戰果正在擴大中，迄現在已判明之戰果（已發表者亦同時列入）如次：轟沉擊沉航空母艦七艘，驅逐艦一艘。（註）前發表艦種不詳者三艘，現經判明爲航空母艦三艘，擊毀航空母艦兩艘，戰艦一艘，巡洋艦一艘，其他艦種不詳者十一艘。</p>
<h3>被擊沉之敵美巨型航空母艦</h3>
<p>東京十五日中央社電　日大本營十五日下午三時發表，日軍於台灣東方海面，向敵機動部隊反覆猛攻，又擊沉擊毀敵航空母艦九艘，擊沉驅逐艦一艘，擊毀戰艦巡洋艦各一艘，艦型不明者十一艘之大戰果，此項發表數字，乃十二日十三日兩日戰果中大本營確認者，其對敗走中之敵機動部隊主力之追擊殲滅戰，至十五日仍在繼續展開中。十四日，擊沉特設空母一艘，戰艦一艘，大破大型空母一艘，燒毀大型艦一艘，已早經判明，料敵機動部隊似已陷於全滅狀態。又發表中日軍部隊除基地航空部隊外，並有艦隊之出動，隱忍自重，等待戰機之日本帝國海軍，現正繼續捕捉優勢之敵機動部隊，展開一大殲滅戰。　　東京十五日中央社電　日帝國海軍部隊精銳，自十二日夜起，反覆攻擊台灣東方海面美海軍太平洋艦隊之第五十八機動部隊之主力，美國艦隊已全喪失攻擊力，但十四日下午七時起至九時止，復以兩次波狀攻擊台灣各地，其後即急速收歛空中部隊，企圖救助沉沒之航空母艦上乘員，至上午十一時左右，開始遁走，戰果如次：日本海軍合計共擊毀擊沉美國艦艇二十三艘，十四日晨并擊退企圖遁走之美軍機動部隊，其戰果之擴大，頗堪期待。　　東京十五日中央社電　日帝國海軍部隊精銳，自十二日夜起，反覆攻擊台灣東方海面美海軍太平洋艦隊之第五十八機動部隊之主力，美國艦隊已全喪失攻擊力，但十四日下午七時起至九時止，復以兩次波狀攻擊台灣各地，其後即急速收歛空中部隊，企圖救助沉沒之航空母艦上乘員，至上午十一時左右，開始遁走，戰果如次：日本海軍合計共擊毀擊沉美國艦艇二十三艘，十四日晨并擊退企圖遁走之美軍機動部隊，其戰果之擴大，頗堪期待。　　東京十五日中央社電　美軍機動部隊此次之大舉出動，企圖進攻日軍腹地，經日航空隊猛烈攻擊後，如日大本營發表確已受重創，於敵艦倉皇敗退之際，日本艦隊又一擁而至，海空一體展開殲滅之大攻擊戰，結果此企圖於菲律賓及台灣登陸之敵機動艦隊，終遭日本海軍之痛擊，而陷於崩潰之危機。按此次敵主力之出動，乃係羅斯福於此次四選前，由於政治之動機，而實施此無謀作戰者，此來敵之企圖，旣遭大敗，日本於太平洋之作戰，至此已開始轉爲攻勢之第一階段，恐羅斯福以次之美國各首腦必遭受此珍珠灣以來第一次大敗之事實，但已轉爲攻勢之日本海軍，今後更將積極展開作戰，故敵軍終難免露其馬腳，至彼恃美國民衆勢將瞪前結舌，立於敗戰事實之耳。</p>
<h3>美五十八機動隊攻勢陷於崩潰</h3>
<p>松島部長談台灣東戰果　　中央社訊　日駐華艦隊報道部松島部長，十五日就日海軍於台灣東方海面，擊沉擊破敵艦二十三艘之大戰果，發表談話如下：台灣東方海面，猛烈之海空軍作戰，自有史以來，以此次爲最，當將知彺十八機動部隊全部擊滅，日方所獲綜合戰果，爲轟沉擊沉航空母艦七艘，驅逐艦一艘，擊破航空母艦二艘，戰艦一艘，巡洋艦一艘，艦種不詳者十一艘，如是赫赫之戰果，實震驚世界之觀聽。敵美對神國日本之南方</p>
<h3>要塞台灣</h3>
<p>企圖伸展其侵略之野望之尼米資攻勢，於茲已不堪我方必殺之猛攻，陷於總崩潰，演出全軍總退卻之醜態，此次發現於台灣東方海面之敵機動部隊，一部爲前十日襲琉球者，再加入主力部隊似爲第三艦隊司令長官赫爾賽所指揮，其總兵力尚不詳，推算之約爲航空母艦集團四羣，以一羣爲空母，二乃至三艘，戰艦及巡洋艦一至二艘，驅逐艦四至六艘，計算總共數目爲二十八艘及至三十六艘。根據十五日日大本營所發表之戰果，轟沉擊沉入艘，擊破十五艘，總計二十三艘，可見敵殆已瀕於全滅，實爲玻根維爾海戰在太平洋所有敵攻擊部隊之主力，已蒙受悲慘之打擊，眞如敵所謂[十三日星期五爲最慘之戰鬥]已實現矣。激戰</p>
<h3>亙四晝夜</h3>
<p>作必死敢鬥之日航空部隊及擔任台灣防衛制空及地上之各部隊以及民防空部隊，其奮鬥如何，我人當可想像得見矣。敵此次來犯合灣，可視爲菲島之前提作戰，一面因菲島地形複雜及日鐵壁之防備，不易下手，乃以台灣爲攻擊方向，此點亦可明白見之。敵以塞班爲中斷基地，企圖攻擊南方要衝，根據彼等歷次所言[發見於中國大陸之近道]，然反遭日方精銳之痛烈反擊，彼等所誇耀之第五十八機動部隊之主力已被擊滅，敵方對日實行強化中之大東亞要域之我戰略態勢，極感焦慮，敵如探求向中國大陸之近道，乃促成此次無謀之出擊，於此可以想見。更具體言之，美總統羅斯福爲企圖於選舉前收獲何等決定的戰果，美海軍太平洋戰略，遂致發生此重大蹉跌，今帝國戰爭指導方針，在於大陸縱斷作戰及東南中國沿岸肅清作戰，基於如是雄大構想，陸海軍正緊密協力下，着着展開之時，一舉</p>
<h3>破碎英美</h3>
<p>渝等反軸心陣營之策應，以形勢而觀，美國亦不能安心，蓋日本大戰略之完全使敵陷入吾術中，此則由於前綫將兵之奮戰，而獲有此次大戰果暑。此次之敵艦隊擊滅戰與大陸作戰相同，對陸海軍之協力完壁，尤爲我等所感激者，厥爲航空部隊中之陸空軍，猛然抱魚雷挺身奮鬥，於太平洋海洋戰，實爲海陸一體決戰之一序曲，但敵今後不免將有各種反擊，即以B29機等作自暴自棄的空襲，惟對敵如是之蠢動，由於我保衛東亞之戰略態勢，終不爲徵動，大東亞十億民衆，應信賴日本強大之戰力，以自信與希望，努力增強戰力，以獲得最後勝利。</p>
<h3>美旗艦司令官米捷爾陣亡</h3>
<p>東京十五日中央社電　敵美有力機動部隊出擊台灣東方海面，十二，十三兩日受損甚大，喪失航空母艦多艘，其中包括超重大型空母艦一艘，該艦似爲敵美機動部隊之旗艦，司令長官米捷爾想亦在其中。十二，十三兩日戰塲附近海面波濤洶湧，極難進行救助工作，如米捷爾亦如其他兵士艘，不得不與波臣爲伍，恐彼現已不在人世矣。</p>
<h3>野村海軍大將談台灣作戰</h3>
<p>東京十五日中央社電　樞密顧問官野村吉三郎海軍大將，頃就台灣方面海面之大捷，發表談話，其大意謂，此次作戰，可說乃出於尼米資之計劃，哈爾賓性格的作戰色彩，頗爲濃厚，哈爾賓者乃冒險的猛進之標本，頗有狩獵之水減之打擊，此次驕敵實巳蒙受重創，然使敵軍混亂，即認爲日本巳轉爲優勝之攻勢，尚不可能。以此種觀法，批評此次戰果，實應嚴戒，此次戰果雖大，然尼米資指揮太平洋攻勢，仍將繼續，應切實認識彼等奪還菲律賓，對鎖南方資源之作戰計劃，並無變化，應知尚未予敵以決定的打擊。敵軍非與日軍艦隊挑戰，乃一卒怯之遮斷兵糧補給綫戰術，意欲盡量避免損失，而使日軍喪失戰意，一部承認爲敵軍以羅斯福大選期近而焦急，實則不然，敵軍戰意決非如此膚淺者，乃持有旺盛之戰意，此點應有正視之必要。</p>
<h3>敵機襲馬尼刺擊落十八架</h3>
<p>馬尼刺十五日中央社電　十五日上午十時半許，曾有敵艦載機戰鬥機轟炸機聯合編隊約六十架，來襲馬尼刺地區，日軍制空部隊當行迎擊，已將其擊退，至下午三時判明之戰果，計擊落敵機十八架，日方損失極輕。</p>
<h3>漢市民衆獻機極爲踴躍</h3>
<p>漢口十五日中央社電　本市自展開獻金運動以來，連日民衆團體前往輸將者甚爲踴躍，足徵市民對於愛護祖國，保衛東亞之熱忱。日昨續收到各業公會等共捐國幣二十七萬元，連前獻金總數已逾三百五十萬元。</p>
<h3>桂林陷落已迫在眉睫平南方面發生激戰</h3>
<p>廣州十五日中央社電　日軍勢如破竹，一路前進，桂林之陷落已迫在眉睫。渝軍防衛西南之最後要衝，刻僅餘柳州與南寗，現在正極力使柳州要塞化，並積極防衛南寗。又日軍制壓西江兩岸，直陷平南，成迅速西進之形勢。渝方已於十一日之廣播中言明，謂日軍佔領平南後，分兵二路指顧桂平，向西南猛進，目下正在距該地十公里處，與渝軍激戰中。按平南與南寗相隔三百五十公里，突破此處險峻地帶後，即爲丘陵起伏之平原地帶云。</p>
<h3>渝方承認桂平陷落</h3>
<p>里斯要十五日中央社電　據華盛頓來電，渝軍司令部十四日夜發表·桂省南部要衝桂平，經十三日晨巷戰後陷落。　　廣州十四日中央社電　據重慶電，渝軍委會十三日夜發表，日軍於十二日晨，已突入桂平縣城，同時並承認閩省福州，已爲晶軍佔領。</p>
<h3>渝政權混亂情形</h3>
<p>里斯本十五日中央社電　據紐約來電，美外交政策協會十三日發表一文，混亂已極之渝政權內情，充分暴露，其要旨如次：渝軍在中國大陸戰綫迭次敗北，此則由於武器缺乏所致，蓋渝政權之上層階級，在政治上非常腐敗，專以內部相尅爲事也。另一方面，渝方民衆對於渝方完遂戰爭之方針，渝方民衆不願投軍，實屬當然。於是渝當局乃派遣軍隊赴各地強徵不願投軍之民衆，惟由此等民衆徵集而來之軍隊，派往前綫者二十人中僅有一人，此種狀態殊屬普遍。至於中國農民其對重慶政權之苛歛，更深惡痛絕，故彼等自經日軍救出，脫離渝方之惡政後，即着着協力日軍，此舉要亦爲渝軍敗北之一因也。</p>
<h3>戈林勉德人作更大犧牲</h3>
<p>粕林十五日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：昨日戈林上將於視察德軍根據地及軍隊，並參觀德中部某軍火工廠，旋向該廠工人發表演說，其大意如次：敵於本月中擊敗德意志之奢望已成泡影，世界最大之強國竟不能戰勝德民族，殊堪欣幸，亦足證德人實力之大，敵雖集中全力以攻，亦將不能獲勝。戈林上將警告德人不可以爲反軸心國戰勝後可阻止共產主義者統治德人，亦不可深信敵人間之意見分歧，蓋彼等均同意殲滅德意志也。戈林上將又舉反軸心國佔領區中共黨得勢爲例，勗勉德人努力工作以免滅亡，謂前後方均須作更大之犧牲，今日德人並非防禦他國土地，全世界將知德人如何捍衛國土，渠深信德人將以不動搖之意志而獲得成功。</p>
<h3>義首揆申明德義團結</h3>
<p>米蘭十五日中央社電　義首揆墨索里尼昨日接見黑衣團代表時演說稱：現時德國方從事於決戰，聯合一致作驚人之抗戰，吾人再度申明全力與國社主　義之德國團結云。</p>
<h3>波流亡主席與邱吉爾會晤</h3>
<p>斯德哥爾肇十五日中央社電　據海通社訊：倫敦電臺今晨稱：盧布林波蘭國民解放委員會主席摩拉夫斯基昨與邱吉爾史太林艾登莫洛托夫會議歷三小時之久，會後英首相始與波流亡政府總理來柯拉席克及外長羅默會議數小時，與摩拉夫斯基之會議爲邱氏抵莫斯科之首次會議云。</p>
<h3>國際簡訊</h3>
<p>美少將被俘　里斯本十五日中央社電　美陸軍部昨日宣布：美陸軍少將范納曼，已被德軍所俘　　蘇軍損失數額　斯德哥爾摩十五日中央社電英每日郵報赫爾新基特派員十四日報稱：德蘇開戰以來，蘇軍損害約一千二百萬名，佔蘇聯開戰當初動員總數二分之一。　　特戈爾沒收財產日內瓦十五日中央社電據海通社訊：巴黎廣播息，特戈爾政府頒布命令稱，自戰事開始以來，非法所得之財產，將予以沒收之處分，該命令中並未解釋[非法]之意義，巴黎居民恐該令將德軍佔領期內所得之財產，均認爲[非法]云。</p>
<h3>西綫德軍反攻克復佛日高地</h3>
<p>亞琛附近展開壕溝戰　　柏林十五日中央社電　據海通社戰地記者艾姆斯高德稱：西綫德軍於反攻後克復佛日山西麓之第六十二號高山，該高山位於吉拉特米西南十四公里處拉勃萊斯村之附近，於星期五下午被阿爾及爾步兵第三師所攻佔，該師奉令向吉拉特米推進時，佔領該高地，德軍於星期五下午發動反攻，於黃昏以前克復該高地，並予阿爾及爾軍以重大之損失，雙方在莫斯洛特山谷一帶村落中展開巷戰，敵軍死傷甚衆。巴資將軍再圖進攻佛日之德軍陣地，亦未獲逞，倫勃維勒以東白魯村附近，美軍裝甲車隊進攻失敗，殘餘美軍於短兵相接後完全被殲滅。　　柏林十五日中央社電　德元首大本營十四日發表：一亞琛附近展開戰壕戰，美軍雖屢以有力戰車部隊進攻，終因德軍擲彈兵之勇敢抵抗未有甚大進展。一伯爾格來德南方止下正展開激烈之攻防戰，且華沙北方之那萊夫河橋頭堡方面，蘇軍於極猛烈之砲擊及空軍之掩護下，企圖突破德軍陣地，然終歸失敗，且德軍已重整戰綫將里加東部重要軍事設施完全破壞後，向西岸移動。</p>
<h3>華沙以北展開激戰</h3>
<p>柏林十五日中央社電　德國新聞社訊，軍息：昨日爲華沙以北及羅森地區展開第二次大攻防戰之第四日，結果德軍獲得成功，蘇軍雖由其那萊夫河橋頭堡獲得少許拓展，但未能突破德軍陣地。敵由托羅根—蒂爾陣地。敵由托羅根—蒂爾希特地區將增援部隊運至羅森戰區，足見其重視此戰，其結果使蘇軍於獸麥爾河下游之攻勢弛鬆，德軍於該河之北進行掃蕩戰，改善陣地。</p>
<h3>里加東部德軍撤退</h3>
<p>柏林十五日中央社電　據海通社訊，軍事發言人昨稱：里加橋頭之德軍，已自德文那河東岸撤至該河之西岸，蘇方所稱衝入里加之消息，實屬不確，因蘇軍進入里加東部時，德軍早已撤退，故幾無戰事，該戰之西部，現尚在德軍之手。</p>
<h3>日首相菲總統作交換廣播</h3>
<p>基於條約決全力援菲　　東京十五日中央社電　十四日下午七時二十分，日小磯首相與菲律賓大總統洛勒爾作交換廣播，小磯首相演說大意如次：菲律賓之獨立，乃菲律賓一千八百萬人民數世紀不屈不撓之努力與門爭所賜，乃以許多烈士之熱血所換來者，爲民族解放之犧牲決心與協力純正之東洋精神，吾人深爲敬佩同情，此次大東亞戰爭勃發，日本帝國不僅將菲律賓之美國勢力驅逐，並積極援助其獨立，此乃吾人之目的，去年今日，菲律賓之宣告獨立，一方係菲律賓國民多年鬥爭建設所賜，同時日軍之果敢作戰，擊破美國勢力，奠定獨立之基礎，亦頗足誇耀。際此一週年紀念之時，衷心極爲欣慰，菲律賓獨立後之一年中，清高之洛勒爾大總統指揮下，向新國家建設邁進，不僅日本帝國，即大東亞各國及歐洲各軸心國家，對菲律賓之發展，均以滿腔同情，寄與祝意。然英美今竟抹殺菲律賓之獨立，高呼奪回菲，開始殺害無辜民衆，因之菲律賓於九月二十三日終於奮起，向英美布告宣戰。日本帝國基於同盟條約，決定帝國之實力，不惜一切，擁護菲律賓之獨立，斷不容菲律賓復爲美國支配，帝國旣具此種信念，故對菲律賓之援助，亦不求任何代價。</p>
<h3>巴莫代表演說</h3>
<p>仰光十五日中央社電　緬甸國家代表巴莫氏，以十四日爲菲律賓獨立一週紀念日，特於是日發表祝賀演說，其大意謂，菲律賓共和國爲保衛其獨立，憶奮然而起，從事戰爭，故當此之時，菲律賓獨立一週紀念日，實具有特別之意義與神聖之使命。希望菲律賓於戰爭中獲致成功，使足以令國家自由與名譽曁民族生命得保存其自由獨立。</p>
<h3>泰相廣播祝詞</h3>
<p>盤谷十五日中央社電　菲律賓獨立一週年紀念日，泰首相阿巴溫交換廣播祝辭，要旨如次：泰國國民於菲律賓國民達成國家獨立之大業時，欣喜異常，蓋菲律賓與泰國保有善鄰關係，且同爲亞洲國家故也。茲謹以泰國民之名義，祈祝菲律賓之繁榮與發展。</p>
<h3>井口部長發表談話</h3>
<p>東京十五日中央社電　日情報報局井口第三部長，在菲律賓獨立一週年紀念日，發表談話如次：往時美國對菲律賓所施之政策，根本否定其國民生活之充分發展，僅使之成爲合衆國過剩商品之消化市塲，待菲律賓國民對此表示拒經時，美國方始承認其於一九四六年獨立，但此僅係政治之手段而已·今菲律賓已實現其獨立之宿願，而美國仍漠視此種事實，竟再度來犯，企圖恢復其壓制支配之地位，至此，已可證明美國之承認其獨立，決非眞意。今日菲律賓共和國已獨立一年，菲國國民於英明之洛勒爾大總統領導下，已舉國一致完成革新大東亞民族精神之偉業，並更爲防衛國土，對抗英美帝國主義之侵略，於進行作戰準備之後，已對美英宣戰，即菲律賓國民，以自己之英勇，已將美帝國主義者之僞裝剝掉，向全世界暴露其爲侵犯神聖獨立之侵略者。由於菲律賓獨立所徵象之東亞和平，方爲日本此次以自存自衛爲原則之作戰目的，日本國民旣知菲律賓之獨立與防衛，關係自身之命運，故切望共同協力對美作戰，以獲得勝利之光榮。</p>

<h3>陳彬龢詞</h3>
<p>陳彬龢氏講詞略謂：諸位青年朋友，兄弟乃從事新聞記者，近幾年來，從未敢向青年演講，因於本身猶覺得不夠！今日請李思浩先生蒞會演講，適李氏因事未克出席，命由兄弟代表到會。目前大家深知在大東亞戰爭決戰之秋，而我中國爲參戰國之一員，試問我國有多少力量？社會有多少力量？深感非常慚愧！爲什麼我國國家社會沒有力量，而一般人多自私，消沉，對國家社會不負責任，深覺中國前途非常危險。唯所希望者，乃屬青年朋友，十年，二十年後的中國建設，其實任亦即在青年身上。我們必須在老的中國軀體中，注射新的青年的血液，查青年有二種特點：一每一青年均有超純潔而富於正義感，是則是，非則非。二青年思想均進步的，都爲正義，爲國家發揮奮鬥的精神—惟雖有此二種特質，尚嫌不足，至希每一青年吸收很多的智識，及將身體鍛鍊。我們參加總動員，必須充實智識加強特質，方可毅然與環境奮門，要參加建設總動員，必須將身體鍛鍊，精誠團結，全力以赴，始能完成大東亞青年。</p>
<h3>各區籌設防空監視哨</h3>
<p>本市市民防空本部爲實施防空體制，確保大上海之安全起見，規定於各區保甲普遍設置防空監視哨，其辦法業經公布，並已開始積極籌劃。又本市中外市民爲對上海地區防空一體協力完成一元化，并將成立[防空協議會]云。</p>

<h3>再論重慶政權一</h3>
<p>— 吉田東祐</p>
<p>事物看着美，即是事物看着眞。——馬修·亞諾爾德（Mothew　Arnodl）　　問　接二十八日重慶電，英文晚報說：[今數月內，重慶政權將斷然改組]，這是否可能？　　答　按最近形勢言，重慶發生政變的可能性，相當大。英文晚報所舉出的理由：　　一·渴望重慶政權內自由主義者走上政治舞台的國民參政會，對於重慶政權的指責和建議，近來突然增加。　　二·重慶政權爲肩負戰爭責任計，美國輿論日益認爲有改組的必要。　　這種[非難，特別是指軍政部長兼參謀總長何應欽和財政部長孔祥熙而言的]。同時二十七日的廣東電訊上也講：二十一日蔣介石在重慶會召集緊急秘密會議，討論應自力抗戰，抑或等待美國對日攻勢的問題，但參加會議者無不根據蔣介石的主張而主張，須待美國對日發動攻勢時，而進行總反攻。蔣介石愈依賴美國，則美國所希望的重慶政權改組，可能性亦愈大，這是自然的道理。　　問　究竟是什麼原因，才發生那種情形的呢？你在[重慶政權觀]一文中，從來就沒有提到可能發生這樣情形，這是什麼道理？　　答　抽著[重慶政權觀]，是根據廣西作戰前的客觀形勢而寫的。我認爲廣西作戰，在日本對重慶的關係這一點上，會給與甚至軍事當局也不瞭解的重大政治影響。　　湖南作戰後接着又廣西作戰，以及南方的北上呼應作戰，這完全使重慶的第三戰區和第七戰區與中央隔離起來。恢復該兩戰區的兵站補充，對於重慶並不是輕而易舉的事。重慶從未想到過自力可以達到這一目的。因此，以蔣介石爲首的國粹派，很知道結果如何，於是不得不希望美國軍隊在中國登陸，以及大量武器援助。美國固然在大吹大擂地宣傳着所謂[尼米資攻勢]之戰略目標，即在中國沿岸登陸，但敵人也很知道在中國本土登陸是如何困難，犧牲將如何重大，所以美國最初就沒想冒險，大規模在中國本土登陸，與硬敵日軍主力對抗。縱令膽敢進行，而登陸的部隊，也只能對第三戰區和第七戰區的重慶軍，盡一督戰隊的任務。然而廣西作戰開始以前，蔣介石爲了中國的前途，並未希望這一點。我認爲蔣氏的來意，只求美國源源運來重兵器的飛機，而單獨中國是可以應付裕如的。然而時至今日，情形大變，蔣介石也不能不希望美軍登陸，或改爲從來所無的大量武力援助。戰局的這種變化，自然對於政治方面也有很大影響。蔣介石已經不能說願意或不願意了，而現在則不得不考慮美國所要求的重慶政權民主化了。重慶政權業已通過了人權保障和新聞檢查緩和等一連串的民主法案，但美國並不滿足這種矯柔造做的民主化姿態。美國認爲重慶政權本身如不民主化，而法令無論怎樣民主化，但執行法令時總會有[怠工]現象發生。然而一本正經的美國，並無撤換國粹派中心人物蔣介石的勇氣。無論如何，蔣介石仍得算中國各種複雜勢力的總結，在各方面上說，是抗戰中國的統一象徵。因此，美國縱對蔣介石不滿，但也不能把他的位置讓與別人。所以美國的攻擊，自然就落到蔣介石左右手的何應欽和孔祥熙頭上。美國很清楚，蔣介石的這批伙伴們，才是[專制政治]的靈魂，民主共和的死敵。何慶欽和孔祥熙旣是實行蔣介石政策的忠實伙伴，所以蔣介石總想營救他們，但在衆止睽睽之下，也只有徒呼奈何。重慶政權改組，或許就在這數月內實行。按目前形勢說，尚不能斷言任何結果。　　問　假如改組一旦實現，親英美派代替國粹派而取得重慶政府的領導權，那末是否就是[國粹派的沒落]呢？　　答　你這種看法，顯然是一種日本人的看法。國粹派決不是那樣容易沒落的。爲求瞭解這一點，就有必要先研究一下蔣介石專制獨裁之本質。蔣介石這位專制主義者，與史太林和希持勒等專制主義者，是不可日是而語的。史太林和希特勒的背後，是有統治階級的有機的統一意志。他們權力的來源，是產生於統制階級意志的統一性和組織性。史太林和希特勒的決定，是通過各自的政黨，而普遍實行到國內所有角落的。那末蔣介石的背後有什麼呢？國民黨能夠代表中國統治階級的統一意志麼？決不可能的。中國的統治階級除國民黨外，尚有國家社會黨，中國青年黨，第三黨等，自然這些黨派的勢和，遠落於國民黨之後，但中國總是有五花八門的政黨。國民黨本身的組織，也極其散漫，而絕不能與蘇聯共產黨或德國納粹黨等的統一性相提並論。何況國民黨中，尚有許多不參加任何集團的政治家存在呢？此類事實，足以證明蔣介石所代表的中國統治階級之意志，是極端缺少統一性和有機性的。在這一點上，蔣介石不僅不能此擬希特勒和史太林，而且還處於非常可憐的環境裹。但蔣介石正利用這一環境，而建立他的專制政治。正因爲統治階級的意志不統一，而蔣介石才利用各派勢力的對立，才在各派勢力的均衡上建立自己的權力。只是在這一點上，蔣介石才與史太林和希特勒有完全不同的獨自手腕。最初他在右派胡漢民左派汪精衛等勢力均衡上，會建立起來自已的地位，所以他永久不由是觀之，縱令有所謂[政變]，而何應欽孔祥熙之類的國粹派，縱能被親英美派人所代替，但何應欽孔祥熙等的勢力，也決不會喪失無餘，同時他們也一定拼命保存準備掩土重來的新勢力均衡。這決不是國粹派的沒落，同時還不要忘記，蔣介石本身就是國粹派的中心人物。　　問　你這樣說，好像蔣介石不是[專制獨裁者]，這豈不是完全與中國常識相左麼？　　答　我的話並沒有錯·一般人說蔣介石不是大獨裁者時，總喜歡把他毫無條件地比作希特勒和史太林。這就很容易對蔣介石政權的本質發生錯覺。希特勒和史太林旣是代表統治階級的統一的有機意志，所以有非常敏捷的決定力。昨日你死我活撕殺的死敵。今日也可以握手言歡稱伙伴！昨日的伙伴，今日也可以火拼。但蔣介石的獨裁，就不能像希特勒一樣獨斷獨行，向昨日的朋友偷放冷箭，而發動反蘇戰爭那種決定力。這是因爲蔣介石縱令在外表上看着非常獨裁，但他的獨裁並不是以統治階級的有組織的統一意志爲基礎，而是以統治階級的散溫的矛盾意志爲基礎。所以他決不會有希特勒和史太林那樣的政治決斷力。國民黨內部的覺悟份子，</p>
<p>瞭如指掌地知道重慶政權有這一缺點。所謂[一個政府，一個政黨，一個領袖]這種口號，老實說，這就是想把蔣介石背後的統治階級意志，加以統一化和組織化的運動。　　　　　　（未完）</p>

<h3>On the Eve of the Decisive Battle</h3>
<p>Q: Regarding the enemy American air raids on Taiwan, what is the current status of the battle, and please provide details.</p>
<p>A: Regarding the enemy aircraft raids on Taiwan, the battle situation has been reported daily in the news, as announced by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters. The enemy aircraft began their raids on the morning of the 12th. Allied air forces immediately engaged them, searching for the enemy aircraft's departure points and the location of enemy mobile forces. As a result, enemy fleets were discovered in the waters east of Taiwan. Repeated and intense attacks were launched, resulting in the sinking of seven enemy aircraft carriers, one destroyer, the destruction of two aircraft carriers, one battleship, one cruiser, and eleven ships of unknown type. The pursuit and attack are still ongoing.</p>
<p>Q: Judging from the size of the enemy's naval and air forces deployed this time, it seems to be a large-scale, desperate gamble, isn't it?</p>
<p>A: The enemy deployed 3,000 aircraft to attack the entire island of Taiwan. The scale is indeed the largest since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War. The enemy fleet is the Pacific Third Fleet, commanded by Halsey, also known as Task Force 58. At the same time, the enemy's most powerful and elite forces in the Pacific Fleet are completely concentrated in this mobile task force. Therefore, this battle can be seen as the prelude to a decisive battle. Consequently, the Allied air forces do not consider engaging enemy aircraft as the most important task, but rather, searching for and discovering the location of the enemy mobile task force as the primary mission. Once discovered, they will exert all efforts to inflict a fatal blow, fundamentally destroying the enemy's main force in the Pacific. Based on this objective, the Allied land and sea forces are working together to search, and judging from the results obtained, they have completed a portion of their mission. Secondly, with the enemy deploying as many as 3,000 aircraft, the mobile task force cannot stray far, but rather adopts a shuttle formation, appearing and disappearing to the left and right, attempting to evade Japanese searches. However, the Japanese forces are continuously searching, and as a result, it is difficult for them to escape. Therefore, it can be known that the complete annihilation of the enemy mobile task force is a predetermined fate.</p>
<p>Q: In that case, isn't the enemy's military action equivalent to moths flying into a flame, seeking their own destruction?</p>
<p>A: Indeed, the enemy's move appears to be a reckless gamble. However, the enemy Americans decided on this action with a plan and strategy. Because Taiwan is Japan's largest stronghold, with the Japanese mainland to the east, the Chinese mainland to the west, and the Philippines to the south, Japan has built its most powerful air force here. Therefore, the enemy, using the violence of 3,000 aircraft, attempts to destroy Japan's air power in Taiwan in one fell swoop, gain air supremacy, and then carry out the Philippine offensive, so that the west can be relieved of the war in mainland China and the east can launch air raids on the Japanese mainland. However, the Allied Japanese have made thorough preparations. Even if the enemy Americans use greater forces, they will surely be destroyed. Moreover, the enemy has now deployed its most elite main force, which has already suffered a fatal blow. The stage of decline and exhaustion is not far off.</p>
<p>Q: But then, what is the ultimate motivation behind the enemy Americans' willingness to exert all their strength? And what is the likely future trend of the war situation?</p>
<p>A: The enemy Americans' all-out effort in this battle is, first and foremost, driven by Roosevelt's attempt to secure a fourth term as president, risking obtaining news of victory to win popular support. Secondly, the anti-war sentiment is widespread among the enemy's population, forcing them to risk using news of victory to regain public confidence. The failure of Roosevelt's adventurous strategy has already been demonstrated by the facts. We can pay attention to several more points regarding the significance of this battle of Taiwan: First, the enemy Americans' boasting of their strong military power and their disparagement of the weakness of the Japanese air force have now been shattered without attack. Second, the enemy Americans' perception of cutting off the connection between the Japanese mainland and the southern regions as extremely easy is now known to be quite difficult. At the same time, the attempt to approach mainland China, although it cannot be completely crushed, has already given the enemy the feeling that it cannot be done. Third, Roosevelt's attempt to use the spoils of war to succeed in a fourth election has now been thwarted. If Roosevelt succeeds in a fourth election, the American people will inevitably suffer more and greater bloodshed. Fourth, the small victories of Saipan, Tinian, and Miyakojima in the past were used by the enemy Americans to deceive the world, claiming that the Japanese military was incompetent. It has now been proven that the enemy Americans' past propaganda was completely false.</p>
<h3>Elite Japanese Naval Forces Deployed; Enemy Ships Annihilated East of Taiwan; Cumulative Sinking and Destruction Reaches 23 Vessels in Recent Days</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3 PM on the 15th: The enemy mobile task force east of Taiwan has been retreating eastward for days since the 14th. Japanese forces have repeatedly attacked them intensely, and the results are expanding. As of now, the confirmed results (including those previously announced) are as follows: Seven aircraft carriers sunk, one destroyer sunk. (Note) Three vessels previously announced as "type unknown" have now been identified as three aircraft carriers. Two aircraft carriers destroyed, one battleship, one cruiser, and eleven other vessels of unknown type.</p>
<h3>Enemy American Giant Aircraft Carriers Sunk</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3 PM on the 15th that Japanese forces, through repeated and intense attacks on the enemy mobile task force east of Taiwan, have sunk or destroyed nine enemy aircraft carriers, sunk one destroyer, destroyed one battleship and one cruiser each, and achieved a major victory of eleven vessels of unknown type. This announced number is the result of the Imperial Headquarters' confirmation of the battles on the 12th and 13th. The pursuit and annihilation of the main force of the retreating enemy mobile task force continues to unfold as of the 15th. On the 14th, one specially equipped aircraft carrier and one battleship were sunk, and one large aircraft carrier was heavily damaged and one large ship was burned, which was already determined earlier. It is expected that the enemy mobile task force is likely in a state of complete annihilation. It was also announced that in addition to the base air force, Japanese forces have also deployed fleets. The Japanese Imperial Navy, enduring and waiting for the opportune moment, is now continuing to capture the superior enemy mobile task force and launch a major annihilation battle. Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - The elite forces of the Japanese Imperial Navy, since the night of the 12th, have repeatedly attacked the main force of the U.S. Navy Pacific Fleet's Task Force 58 east of Taiwan. The American fleet has completely lost its offensive power, but from 7 PM to 9 PM on the 14th, it launched two more wave attacks on various parts of Taiwan. After that, it quickly gathered its air forces, attempting to rescue the crew members on the sinking aircraft carriers, and began to flee around 11 AM. The results are as follows: The Japanese Navy has destroyed or sunk a total of 23 American ships. On the morning of the 14th, it also repelled the fleeing American mobile task force, and the expansion of the results is highly anticipated.

On the morning of the 14th, it also repelled the fleeing American mobile task force, and the expansion of the results is highly anticipated. Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - The enemy American mobile task force's large-scale deployment this time, attempting to attack the Japanese rear, has suffered heavy damage after being fiercely attacked by the Japanese air force, as announced by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters. While the enemy ships were fleeing in panic, the Japanese fleet swarmed in, launching a large-scale annihilation attack by sea and air together. As a result, this enemy mobile fleet, attempting to land in the Philippines and Taiwan, was ultimately severely struck by the Japanese Navy and fell into a crisis of collapse. According to reports, the enemy's main force was deployed this time due to Roosevelt's political motives before the fourth election, implementing this reckless operation. Now that the enemy's attempt has suffered a major defeat, Japan's operations in the Pacific have begun to shift to the first stage of offense. It is feared that Roosevelt and other American leaders will suffer this first major defeat since Pearl Harbor. However, the Japanese Navy, which has already shifted to the offensive, will continue to actively deploy operations, so the enemy will inevitably reveal its weaknesses. As for the American public, they will stare in stunned silence, standing before the facts of defeat.</p>
<h3>U.S. Task Force 58's Offensive Collapses</h3>
<p>Minister Matsushima Discusses the Results East of Taiwan Central News Agency Report - Minister Matsushima of the Japanese Fleet Press Department stationed in China issued the following statement on the 15th regarding the Japanese Navy's great victory of sinking and destroying 23 enemy ships east of Taiwan: The fierce naval and air battle east of Taiwan is the greatest in history. The comprehensive results obtained by Japan in completely annihilating the 18th Mobile Task Force are the sinking of seven aircraft carriers, one destroyer, the destruction of two aircraft carriers, one battleship, one cruiser, and eleven vessels of unknown type. Such a glorious victory will shock the world.</p>
<h3>Fortress Taiwan, a Key Stronghold</h3>
<p>The enemy Americans' Nimitz offensive, attempting to extend their ambitions of aggression towards the divine nation of Japan's southern, has now been defeated by our inevitable and deadly attacks, collapsing entirely and staging an all-out retreat, presenting an ugly spectacle. The enemy mobile task force discovered east of Taiwan, a portion of which was the one that attacked Okinawa ten days earlier, was joined by a main force, likely commanded by Third Fleet Commander Halsey. The total strength is not yet known, but it is estimated to be about four aircraft carrier groups, with one group consisting of two to three aircraft carriers, one to two battleships and cruisers, and four to six destroyers, totaling about 28 to 36 vessels. According to the results announced by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters on the 15th, seven were sunk and fifteen were destroyed, totaling twenty-three. It can be seen that the enemy is almost on the verge of annihilation. This is truly the main force of all enemy attacking forces in the Pacific since the Battle of Bougainville, having suffered a tragic blow, just as the enemy said, "Friday the 13th was the most terrible battle" has been realized. The fierce battle</p>
<h3>Spanning Four Days and Nights</h3>
<p>The Japanese air force, fighting with a spirit of certain death and daring, and the various units responsible for defending Taiwan's airspace and ground, as well as the civil defense air raid units, how they fought can be imagined. The enemy's attack on Taiwan this time can be seen as a precursor to the Philippine operation. On the one hand, because the terrain of the Philippines is complex and the Japanese defenses are like iron walls, making it difficult to start, they took Taiwan as the direction of attack. This point can also be clearly seen. The enemy, using Saipan as an intermediate base, attempted to attack key points in the south, based on what they have said repeatedly: "Discovering a shortcut to mainland China." However, they were met with a fierce counterattack from the elite Japanese forces. The main force of their vaunted Task Force 58 has been annihilated. The enemy is extremely anxious about our strategic posture in the Greater East Asia region, which is being strengthened against Japan. The enemy's search for a shortcut to mainland China prompted this reckless attack, which can be imagined. More specifically, U.S. President Roosevelt's attempt to achieve some decisive victory before the election caused a major setback in the U.S. Navy's Pacific strategy. Now, the Empire's war guidance policy, based on a grand concept of a continental north-south operation and a clean-up operation along the southeast coast of China, is being steadily unfolded with close cooperation between the army and navy.</p>
<h3>Shattering the Anglo-American</h3>
<p>Coordination from Chongqing and other anti-Axis camps. Judging from the situation, the United States cannot rest easy either. The complete inclusion of the enemy in our strategy is due to the fierce fighting of the soldiers on the front lines, which has led to this great victory. This enemy fleet annihilation battle, like the continental operation, is a perfect example of land and sea cooperation, which we are especially grateful for. Especially the army and air force in the air force, bravely fighting with torpedoes, is truly an overture to a decisive battle between land and sea in the Pacific Ocean war. However, the enemy will inevitably have various counterattacks in the future, such as self-destructive air raids by B-29 aircraft. However, the enemy's foolish actions will not be affected by our strategic posture for protecting East Asia. The one billion people of Greater East Asia should trust Japan's strong war power, and with confidence and hope, strive to strengthen our war power to achieve final victory.</p>
<h3>U.S. Flagship Commander Mitchell Killed in Action</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - The enemy American powerful mobile task force launched an attack on the waters east of Taiwan, suffering heavy damage on the 12th and 13th, losing many aircraft carriers, including one super-heavy aircraft carrier. This ship appears to be the flagship of the enemy American mobile task force, and Commander Mitchell is thought to be among those on board. The waters near the battlefield on the 12th and 13th were stormy, making rescue operations extremely difficult. If Mitchell is like the other soldiers, he had no choice but to join the waves. It is feared that he is no longer alive.</p>
<h3>Admiral Nomura Discusses the Taiwan Operation</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - Privy Councilor Admiral Kichisaburo Nomura recently issued a statement on the great victory in the waters off Taiwan. The gist of his statement is that this operation can be said to be based on Nimitz's plan, with a strong Halpin-like operational style. Halpin is a model of adventurous advancement, with a hunt-and-strike approach. This time, the arrogant enemy has suffered a heavy blow. However, it is not possible to believe that Japan has shifted to a superior offensive just because the enemy is confused. This kind of view is a warning against criticizing the results of this battle. Although the results of this battle are great, Nimitz's Pacific offensive will continue. We must firmly recognize that their operational plans to recapture the Philippines and block southern resources have not changed, and we must know that we have not yet dealt the enemy a decisive blow. The enemy army did not challenge the Japanese fleet, but instead adopted a cowardly tactic of interdicting the supply lines, intending to avoid losses as much as possible and make the Japanese army lose its will to fight. Some admit that the enemy army is anxious because Roosevelt's election is approaching, but this is not the case. The enemy army's will to fight is by no means so superficial, but rather they possess a strong will to fight, and this point must be faced squarely.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Attack Manila, Eighteen Shot Down</h3>
<p>Manila, 15th (Central News Agency) - At about 10:30 AM on the 15th, a combined squadron of about 60 enemy carrier-based fighters and bombers attacked the Manila area. The Japanese air defense forces immediately engaged them and repelled them. The results confirmed by 3 PM were that 18 enemy aircraft were shot down. The Japanese side suffered extremely light losses.</p>
<h3>Han Citizenry Eagerly Donate Aircraft</h3>
<p>Hankou, 15th (Central News Agency) - Since the launch of the donation campaign in this city, groups of citizens have been eagerly transporting their donations every day, demonstrating the citizens' enthusiasm for loving their country and protecting East Asia. Yesterday, a total of 270,000 national currency was received from various industry associations, bringing the total amount of previous donations to over 3.5 million.</p>
<h3>Guilin's Fall Imminent; Fierce Fighting in Pingnan Area</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 15th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese army is advancing like a whirlwind, and the fall of Guilin is imminent. The last strongholds of the Chongqing army defending the southwest are now only Liuzhou and Nanning. They are now making every effort to fortify Liuzhou and actively defend Nanning. Also, the Japanese army has seized control of both sides of the Xijiang River and is heading straight for Pingnan, forming a rapid westward advance. The Chongqing side stated in a broadcast on the 11th that after the Japanese army occupied Pingnan, they divided their forces into two routes, pointing to Guiping and advancing fiercely to the southwest. At present, they are fighting fiercely with the Chongqing army ten kilometers away from that area. According to reports, Pingnan is 350 kilometers away from Nanning.

<h3>Chaotic Situation in Chongqing Regime</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from New York, the American Foreign Policy Association released an article on the 13th, fully exposing the chaotic internal situation of the Chongqing regime. The main points are as follows: The Chongqing army has suffered repeated defeats on the mainland China front, which is due to the lack of weapons. The upper class of the Chongqing regime is very corrupt politically and is dedicated to internal strife. On the other hand, the people of Chongqing generally do not want to serve in the army because of the Chongqing side's plan to complete the war. Therefore, the Chongqing authorities sent troops to various places to forcibly conscript people who were unwilling to serve in the army. However, only one out of twenty of the soldiers recruited from these people who were sent to the front lines, which is a common situation. As for the Chinese farmers, they deeply resent the heavy taxes of the Chongqing regime, so after they were rescued by the Japanese army and escaped the evil policies of the Chongqing side, they actively cooperated with the Japanese army. This action is also one of the reasons for the defeat of the Chongqing army.</p>

<p>Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) - The German News Agency reports: Yesterday, General Goering inspected German bases and troops, and visited a munitions factory in central Germany. He then gave a speech to the workers of the factory, the gist of which is as follows: The enemy's hope of defeating Germany this month has become a pipe dream. It is a great honor and sufficient proof of the great strength of the German people that the world's greatest powers cannot defeat the German nation. Even if the enemy concentrates all its efforts to attack, it will not be able to win. General Goering warned the Germans not to think that the victory of the anti-Axis powers could prevent the communists from ruling the Germans, and not to believe deeply in the differences of opinion among the enemies, because they all agree on annihilating Germany. General Goering also cited the growing power of the Communist Party in the occupied areas of the anti-Axis powers as an example, urging the Germans to work hard to avoid destruction, saying that both the front and the rear must make greater sacrifices. Today, the Germans are not defending the lands of other countries. The whole world will know how the Germans defend their country. He is confident that the Germans will succeed with unwavering will.</p>

<h3>Radio Broadcast Exchange Between Japanese Prime Minister and Philippine President</h3>
<p>Based on Treaty, Determined to Fully Support Philippines Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) At 7:20 PM on the 14th, Japanese Prime Minister Koiso and Philippine President Laurel exchanged radio broadcasts. Prime Minister Koiso's speech, in essence, was as follows: The independence of the Philippines is bestowed upon the eighteen million Filipinos through centuries of unwavering efforts and struggles, and is bought with the blood of many martyrs. We deeply admire and sympathize with their determination to sacrifice for national liberation and their pure spirit of Eastern cooperation. With the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese Empire not only expelled American forces from the Philippines but also actively assisted its independence. This was our objective. A year ago today, the declaration of Philippine independence was due to the years of struggle and construction by the Filipino people, and also to the courageous battles of the Japanese army, which defeated American forces and laid the foundation for independence, which is quite commendable. On this first anniversary, I am sincerely delighted. In the year since the Philippines' independence, under the leadership of the honorable President Laurel, it has moved towards the construction of a new nation. Not only the Japanese Empire but also various countries in Greater East Asia and European Axis countries have shown full sympathy and offered blessings to the development of the Philippines. However, Britain and America are now obliterating the independence of the Philippines, shouting to reclaim it, and beginning to massacre innocent civilians. Therefore, the Philippines finally rose up on September 23rd and declared war on Britain and America. Based on the alliance treaty, the Japanese Empire has decided to use all its strength to support the independence of the Philippines and will never allow the Philippines to be dominated by the United States again. The Empire has this belief, so its assistance to the Philippines is not for any price.</p>
<h3>Speech by Ba Maw</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 15th (Central News Agency) Burmese national representative Ba Maw, taking the 14th as the first anniversary of Philippine independence, delivered a congratulatory speech on that day. Its main point was that the Republic of the Philippines rose up courageously and engaged in war to defend its independence. Therefore, at this time, the first anniversary of Philippine independence has special significance and a sacred mission. It is hoped that the Philippines will achieve success in the war, so that national freedom and honor, as well as the life of the nation, can be preserved in freedom and independence.</p>
<h3>Congratulatory Message Broadcasted by Thai Prime Minister</h3>
<p>Bangkok, 15th (Central News Agency) On the first anniversary of Philippine independence, Thai Prime Minister Apaiwong exchanged congratulatory messages via radio broadcast. The main points were as follows: The people of Thailand were overjoyed when the people of the Philippines achieved the great cause of national independence, because the Philippines and Thailand maintain good neighborly relations and are both Asian countries. In the name of the Thai people, I sincerely wish the Philippines prosperity and development.</p>
<h3>Statement by Minister Iguchi</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) Iguchi, the Third Minister of the Japanese Information Bureau, issued a statement on the first anniversary of Philippine independence as follows: In the past, the policy implemented by the United States towards the Philippines fundamentally denied the full development of its people's lives, only making it a market for the disposal of surplus goods from the United States. Only when the Filipino people expressed their rejection of this did the United States recognize its independence in 1946, but this was merely a political maneuver. Now that the Philippines has realized its long-cherished wish for independence, the United States still ignores this fact and has invaded again, attempting to restore its position of oppression and domination. At this point, it can be proven that the United States' recognition of its independence was definitely not genuine. Today, the Republic of the Philippines has been independent for a year. Under the wise leadership of President Laurel, the Filipino people have unanimously completed the great task of reforming the spirit of the Greater East Asian nations and, to defend their homeland and resist the aggression of Anglo-American imperialism, have declared war on the United States and Britain after preparing for war. The Filipino people, with their own bravery, have stripped off the disguise of the American imperialists, exposing them to the world as aggressors who violate sacred independence. The peace in East Asia, as symbolized by Philippine independence, is precisely the goal of Japan's war based on the principle of self-preservation and self-defense. The Japanese people, knowing that the independence and defense of the Philippines are related to their own destiny, eagerly hope to cooperate in the war against the United States to achieve the glory of victory.</p>

The conference ceremony was solemn and grand, and youth from all sectors of the city enthusiastically attended. In addition to speeches by Chen Binhe, the president of this newspaper, and others, there were also speeches by youth representatives from various sectors, which were particularly enthusiastic. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Conference Situation</h3>
<p>The venue was set up inside the Da Guangming Cinema. Two national flags with a blue sky, white sun, and red ground were hung high in the center. The layout was simple and solemn. The ceremony began on time. After everyone performed the rituals, Chairman Li Fang, the envoy, first reported the significance of the meeting, roughly saying: [In the past, East Asia suffered from the aggression of Anglo-American empires. The late Premier advocated revolution and the Pan-Asianism, calling on all Asians to unite and strive for freedom and independence. Allied Japan, in order to achieve the independence and integrity of East Asia, opened the prelude to the Greater East Asia War, shedding blood and sweat on the front and rear lines. After our Chinese youth joined the war, in this great era, we should unite, mobilize, go all out, work hard, and complete the final victory of Greater East Asia.] Following speeches by Chen Binhe, president of Shen Bao, and Xu Tieshan, representatives from various sectors such as news, new year students, vocational youth, and industry, including Ren Yunpeng, Fang Kangnian, and Yao Wenzhun, gave speeches with high spirits, determined to move forward to complete the victory goal of the Greater East Asia Holy War.

<h3>Chen Binhe's Speech</h3>
<p>Chen Binhe's speech roughly stated: Fellow young friends, I am a news reporter. In recent years, I have never dared to give speeches to young people, because I still feel inadequate myself! Today, I invited Mr. Li Sihao to attend the meeting and give a speech, but Mr. Li was unable to attend due to other matters, so he appointed me to represent him at the meeting. Currently, everyone knows that we are in the decisive autumn of the Greater East Asia War, and China is a member of the participating countries. May I ask, how much strength does our country have? How much strength does society have? I feel very ashamed! Why is it that our country's state and society have no strength, and most people are selfish, depressed, and irresponsible to the state and society? I feel that China's future is very dangerous. What I hope for is the young friends. The construction of China in ten or twenty years will actually be the responsibility of the youth. We must inject new youth blood into the old Chinese body. I find that youth has two characteristics: first, every youth has super purity and a sense of justice, right is right, and wrong is wrong. Second, young people's thoughts are progressive, and they all promote the spirit of justice and striving for the country—but even with these two characteristics, it is still not enough. I hope that every youth will absorb a lot of knowledge and exercise their bodies. We must enrich our knowledge and strengthen our characteristics to resolutely struggle with the environment when we participate in the general mobilization. To participate in the construction general mobilization, we must exercise our bodies, be sincerely united, and go all out to complete the Greater East Asia Youth.</p>

<h3>Tax Affairs Department to Implement Voucher-Based Tax Payment System to Prevent Merchants and Citizens from Encroaching on Withheld Taxes</h3>
<p>Since January 16 of this year, the Tax Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance has started collecting special wartime consumption taxes on retail goods and banquets and hotels in fifteen important areas in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui provinces, and the two special municipalities of Beijing and Shanghai. Through supervision and gradual promotion, tax revenue has been increasing daily. Since May of this year, the increase in revenue has been even greater. Especially in the recent two months, the average monthly total tax revenue has reached around 300 million yuan. In order to prevent merchants and citizens from taking advantage of loopholes to conceal and encroach on withheld taxes and to prevent those involved from colluding and engaging in malfeasance, the department has submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance to implement a voucher-based tax payment system. That is, the tax department will print a type of special consumption tax stamp, graded by amount, and issue it to various factories and shops. For any retail transaction that should pay a certain amount of special consumption tax, the relevant shop will issue a ticket and affix the special tax stamp as proof. It is reported that this special tax voucher-based tax payment system is in preparation and should be realized soon.</p>

Therefore, it is specially added and clarified to improve the lighting control and make it more appropriate.</p>

<h3>Re-examining the Chongqing Regime – Part 1</h3>
<p>— Yoshida Tosuke</p>
<p>Looking at something beautiful is the same as looking at something true. – Matthew Arnold</p>
<p>Q: According to a Chongqing dispatch on the 28th, an English-language evening paper stated: [Within the next few months, the Chongqing regime will undergo a decisive reorganization]. Is this possible?</p>
<p>A: Based on the recent situation, the possibility of a political change in Chongqing is quite high. The reasons cited by the English-language evening paper are:</p>
<p>1.  The National Political Council, which desires for liberals within the Chongqing regime to ascend to the political stage, has recently increased its criticisms and suggestions towards the Chongqing regime.</p>
<p>2.  In order to shoulder the responsibility of the war, American public opinion increasingly believes that the Chongqing regime needs to be reorganized.</p>
<p>This [criticism is specifically directed at He Yingqin, the Minister of Military Affairs and Chief of the General Staff, and Kong Xiangxi, the Minister of Finance]. Simultaneously, a Guangdong telegram on the 27th stated: Chiang Kai-shek convened an emergency secret meeting in Chongqing on the 21st to discuss whether to rely on one's own strength to resist Japan or to wait for the American offensive against Japan. However, all those attending the meeting echoed Chiang Kai-shek's idea that a general counter-offensive should be launched when the United States launches an offensive against Japan. The more Chiang Kai-shek relies on the United States, the greater the possibility of the reorganization of the Chongqing regime desired by the United States, which is a natural principle.</p>
<p>Q: What exactly are the reasons for such a situation to occur? In your article "[Observations on the Chongqing Regime]," you never mentioned the possibility of such a situation occurring. What is the reason for this?</p>
<p>A: My writing on "[Observations on the Chongqing Regime]" was based on the objective situation before the Guangxi campaign. I believe that the Guangxi campaign, in terms of Japan's relationship with Chongqing, will have significant political implications that even the military authorities do not understand.</p>
<p>The Hunan campaign followed by the Guangxi campaign, as well as the northern response operations in the south, completely isolated Chongqing's Third War Area and Seventh War Area from the central government. Restoring the logistical supply of these two war areas is not an easy task for Chongqing. Chongqing has never thought that it could achieve this goal on its own. Therefore, the national essence faction led by Chiang Kai-shek is well aware of the consequences and has no choice but to hope for American troops to land in China and for large-scale weapons assistance. The United States is trumpeting the so-called "[Nimitz Offensive]" strategy, which is to land on the Chinese coast, but the enemy also knows how difficult and costly it would be to land on Chinese soil and confront the main force of the stubborn Japanese army. Therefore, the United States initially did not intend to take the risk of a large-scale landing on Chinese soil to confront the main force of the stubborn Japanese army. Even if they dared to do so, the landing troops could only serve as a supervisory team for the Chongqing army in the Third War Area and the Seventh War Area. However, before the start of the Guangxi campaign, Chiang Kai-shek, for the sake of China's future, did not hope for this. I believe that Chiang Kai-shek's intention was only to obtain a steady stream of heavy weapons and aircraft from the United States, and that China alone could handle the situation with ease. However, today, the situation has changed drastically, and Chiang Kai-shek cannot help but hope for American troops to land or for a large amount of military assistance that has never been seen before. This change in the war situation naturally has a great impact on the political aspect. Chiang Kai-shek can no longer say whether he is willing or unwilling, and now he has to consider the democratization of the Chongqing regime demanded by the United States. The Chongqing regime has already passed a series of democratic bills, such as the protection of human rights and the relaxation of censorship, but the United States is not satisfied with this pretentious democratic stance. The United States believes that if the Chongqing regime itself is not democratized, no matter how democratized the laws are, there will always be "[foot-dragging]" in the implementation of the laws. However, the serious United States does not have the courage to replace Chiang Kai-shek, the central figure of the national essence faction. In any case, Chiang Kai-shek is still considered the culmination of China's various complex forces, and in all respects, he is a unified symbol of wartime China. Therefore, even if the United States is dissatisfied with Chiang Kai-shek, it cannot let someone else take his place. Therefore, the American attack naturally falls on He Yingqin and Kong Xiangxi, Chiang Kai-shek's right-hand men. The United States is well aware that Chiang Kai-shek's partners are the soul of "[autocratic politics]" and the mortal enemies of democratic republic. He Yingqin and Kong Xiangxi are loyal partners in implementing Chiang Kai-shek's policies, so Chiang Kai-shek always wants to rescue them, but in the face of public scrutiny, he can only sigh helplessly. The reorganization of the Chongqing regime may take place within these few months. According to the current situation, no conclusion can be drawn yet.</p>
<p>Q: If the reorganization is realized and the pro-British and American faction replaces the national essence faction and gains leadership of the Chongqing government, would that be the "[decline of the national essence faction]?"</p>
<p>A: Your view is obviously a Japanese perspective. The national essence faction is by no means so easy to decline. To understand this, it is necessary to first study the essence of Chiang Kai-shek's autocracy. Chiang Kai-shek, this authoritarian, cannot be compared to authoritarians like Stalin and Hitler. Behind Stalin and Hitler, there is the organic and unified will of the ruling class. The source of their power comes from the unity and organization of the will of the ruling class. Stalin and Hitler's decisions were implemented universally in every corner of the country through their respective political parties. So what is behind Chiang Kai-shek? Can the Kuomintang represent the unified will of the Chinese ruling class? It is absolutely impossible. In addition to the Kuomintang, the Chinese ruling class also includes the National Socialist Party, the China Youth Party, the Third Party, etc. Of course, the power and harmony of these parties are far behind the Kuomintang, but there are always all kinds of political parties in China. The organization of the Kuomintang itself is also extremely loose and cannot be compared with the unity of the Soviet Communist Party or the German Nazi Party. Moreover, there are still many politicians in the Kuomintang who do not participate in any group. These facts are enough to prove that the will of the Chinese ruling class represented by Chiang Kai-shek is extremely lacking in unity and organic nature. In this regard, Chiang Kai-shek is not only unable to compare with Hitler and Stalin, but is also in a very pitiful environment. But Chiang Kai-shek is using this environment to establish his autocratic politics. Precisely because the will of the ruling class is not unified, Chiang Kai-shek uses the opposition of various factions to establish his own power on the balance of various factions. Only in this respect does Chiang Kai-shek have completely different and unique methods from Stalin and Hitler. Initially, he established his own position on the balance of power between the right-wing Hu Hanmin and the left-wing Wang Jingwei, so he will never ignore this. Even if there is a so-called "[political change]," and the national essence faction like He Yingqin and Kong Xiangxi can be replaced by pro-British and American figures, the power of He Yingqin and Kong Xiangxi will never be lost completely. At the same time, they will definitely try their best to preserve and prepare for a new balance of power to cover their comeback. This is by no means the decline of the national essence faction, and do not forget that Chiang Kai-shek himself is the central figure of the national essence faction.</p>
<p>Q: According to what you said, it seems that Chiang Kai-shek is not an "[autocratic dictator]." Isn't this completely contrary to common sense in China?</p>
<p>A: What I said is not wrong. When people say that Chiang Kai-shek is not a big dictator, they always like to compare him unconditionally to Hitler and Stalin. This makes it easy to have misconceptions about the essence of Chiang Kai-shek's regime. Hitler and Stalin represent the unified and organic will of the ruling class, so they have very agile decision-making power. Yesterday, mortal enemies who were fighting to the death can shake hands and call each other partners today! Yesterday's partners can fight each other today. But Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorship cannot be as arbitrary as Hitler, secretly ambushing yesterday's friends and launching a war against the Soviet Union. This is because Chiang Kai-shek, even though he looks very autocratic on the outside, his autocracy is not based on the organized and unified will of the ruling class, but on the scattered and contradictory will of the ruling class. Therefore, he will never have the political decisiveness of Hitler and Stalin. The enlightened members of the Kuomintang</p>
<p>know this shortcoming of the Chongqing regime like the back of their hand. The so-called slogan of "[one government, one party, one leader]," to be honest, is a movement to unify and organize the will of the ruling class behind Chiang Kai-shek.</p>
