<p>代論</p>
<h3>重慶政權何處去？  陳彬龢</h3>
<p>甲：國際戰爭一天天逼近最後决戰的日子了，然而分裂巾國負嵎西南的重慶政權的前途，却有日暮道遠之感，由於重慶政據本身的錯誤，使我國家未能統一，尤所痛心。可是，另一方面也有人或許在想，無論如何，璽慶政權終於拖戰達六年半之久，不正是顯出他們的力量嗎？</p>
<p>乙：抱若着這種見解的人似乎不會少吧？但重慶政權之所以能支持六年半之久者，一言以蔽之，曰：地大物博人衆而已。中國大陸戰綫之長，北起蒙疆，南迄廣州灣雷州牛島，實達七千公里，遠超過德蘇戰綫；而其中一省如四川，其地城即達四十萬五千九百平方公里，亦超過德國本土遠甚。</p>
<p>甲：這是說地域之廣，便於拖戰，但是物博之說，恐未正確，內地物資不是窘急萬狀嗎？</p>
<p>乙：重慶政權地區的生產力，自不足與日本德國相比，但山於人民生活困苦，享用低劣，因此物資周窘而尙可勉强過去。此外，更重耍的因素是由於人衆，重慶政權就在地大物博的基礎上面，驅使豐富的「人的資源」爲其拖戰力，更利用敵人英美之慫恿而維持其政權。</p>
<p>甲：然則，重慶政權利用這幾種條件即可貫澈共持久拖戰嗎？</p>
<p>乙：問題須從兩方面看。過去六年半，固然因爲上述條件而拖戰迄今，可是同時也應該認淸，所謂地大，巳有差不多三分之一的土地給中國共產黨在「抗戰」旗幟下盤踞了；所謂物博人衆，實際究竟在落後的生產方法，同時拖戰的極大消耗，每况愈下，結果「總反攻」的話不再聽到了，縱欲堅守，已極困難，最近常德之戰可爲明例，甚且內部民生的維持也漸趨不堪支持之境了。</p>
<p>甲：是啊，聽說重慶政權下的各地物價，騰踴頗烈。去年八月米價以每市石計，重慶二千二百元，西安己到三千二百元，現在更高，那末，老百姓怎樣生活呢？</p>
<p>乙：重慶政權地區物價指數，據一月五日日本朝日新聞所載特電，去年一月約合事變前八十一倍。八月爲一百六十六倍，年底已已近二百二十倍，而法幣發行額，事變前爲十四億四千九百萬元，現在估計約達三百億元，每月增發額自十五至二十億，加上其他雜鈔及債券約達六百億元；同時由於軍需增大及强制徵購，歲入則相對的减少了。三十二年度重慶政權預算是：</p>
<p>總預算三百憶元，歲入總額一百八十億元，不過預算的六成，而些三百億元，，較諸事變前廿六年度之二十一億元實巳膨脹達十四倍半，共中歲入不足之數，除了發行公債，增加通貨和乞借於美國外，還有什麼辦法？</p>
<p>甲：原來如此！所以有人說，今年元旦日渝蔣的所謂告民衆書中，要特別向羅斯福叩頭了。</p>
<p>乙：其實，這正是太可憐了！從前尙且說利用英美帝國主義反抗日本，是要求援助，現在呢，那裏還是援助？那裏還是利用？簡直是一切唯美國的鼻息是仰，唯美國的命令是從了！美國爲控制對華經濟命脈而借款，重慶能提平　的條件嗎？美國爲擾亂東亞後方而在渝强化空軍，重慶要求統一指抓軍權辦得到嗎？喊了一年牛之久，重開滇緬路增加印渝運輸接濟物資，至今還是空話。</p>
<p>甲：如此說來，重慶拖戰結果，政治日趨黑暗，民生日益疾苦，徒然造成中共盤踞機會。此外，一方面信口侈言位列四强之一，而一方面則容軍完全受美國支配，坐視轟炸同胞殘忍慘酷而不顧。所以，重慶統治下的同胞，渴想和平，自然格外殷切。而重慶政權眞是日暮途窮了。</p>
<p>乙：誠然。</p>

<h3>鮑斯發表論文　述十項指標　進軍德里為下次動</h3>
<p>仰光十九日中央社電　自由印度臨時政府主席江特拉　斯，十八日在自由印度報上發表論文一篇，題名「前進」要旨如次：自此次大戰以來，印度之獨立運動，已克服幾多障害，而迅速推進，回顧印度自由運動途上，已有不少可作指標之進步階段，第一，即於印度獨立聯盟之指導下，使海外印度人組織起來，期由印度外部聲援祖國之獨立。其次爲印度國民之編成，此舉爲印度革命之歷史性事件，此爲印度獲得自由鬥爭之最重要指標。第三，爲於統一之指導下，積極從事政治活動，第四，爲獲得於指導以改組印度國民軍，期早日派赴戰塲作戰。自由之鬥爭，今已屆進展之時，更進一步，而於移獨立是終鬥爭之階段。自由印度臨時政府之樹立，實爲第五之主要指標，第六爲日本及其他各國承認臨時政府，大東亞會議席上參加各國，更予印度獨立關爭以全面援助之保證，因此大東亞會議之舉行，實爲第七階段之指標。余自擔任東亞印人獨立運動之指導以來，即任那比阿爾爲政府無任所閣僚，此即證明在歐印人已與東亞獨立　動聯成一體，進而組織國民運動，同時日人方面已作種種援助，一俟與在祖國獨立運動確立完全之聯擊時，則其後之行動，當爲最易猜測者。今已完成前進之一助準備，獨立運動，已向最後勝利之途躍進。第八爲根據日本之友誼，將安達曼及尼科巴羣島之劃爲印領，成爲自由印度領土之國土，政府與國民軍之遷往緬甸，實具有歷史上之重要性，在最近之將來，將益見光明。進軍德里，巳燃起歷史上之奮鬥火。「越境」乃第十指標，故我等應舉其力突破印緬國境，開始進軍直搗德里。</p>
<h3>日對重要工業　已實施整備　移於眞正戰鬥配置上</h3>
<p>東京十九日中央社電日政府根據戰力增强企業整備基本要綱，對第一種工業部門，已行整備，對紡織，人造絲工廠等應用於軍需產業一事業，積極進行，茲第二種工業部門之企業整備，亦已漸得成案，於十入日之定例閣議中，决定第二種工業部門企業整備措置綱要，對飛機，軍器，艦船，機械及液體烯料工業並其他與此關聯之重要工業加以整備，强化劃定利用及生產之分部，刷新强化生產機能，今次之整備，係將全國工業移於眞正之戰鬥配置上，茲誌該要綱要旨如次：　依生產第一主義，以政府指名定購工塲（基本工廠）爲中心，結成配置協力工塲集團，利用工塲之協力組織體及集團企業，以整備企業系統。　陸海軍需通輸通信各省，分別劃定其指名定購工塲及利用工塲之分野，而期調整定購與專門生產之實現，至此各協力工廠即爲一企業內之一分工廠，而獲舉各集團企業之實效，因此結果對（印）生產計劃與實施之體化，（乙）生產行政之一元化與計劃化等，多年縣案皆得實現·且當此實行之際，决定首由機械工業部門着手，而漸次使各工業部門之實施要綢得急速實行。</p>

<p>南京十九日中央社電　行政院物資統制審議委員會，以油糧為民生日用必需食品，且攸關軍需。値此戰時體制下、對油糧統一管理，不獨需有强有力之機構，且須具備極完善之管理辦法，方能　來源通暢，配給圓滑。一可免除黑巿猖狂、與供求不勻之種種畸形現象。以是該會特制定油糧統一管理暫行辦法、業經行政院例會通過、付諸實行。今後蘇浙皖三省及京滬兩巿內之油糧統一管理事宜、（包括各種食用油及雜糧准麥類除外，）概由全國商業統制總會、責成油糧專業委員會掌理。不必要時，並得由該委員會在各地區設置分支辦事處，俾使今後各地區油糧同業公會會員，在其領導下、辦理油糧之買賣。關於收買價格、亦已明確規定，須參照各種重要農產物（如米麥　、）之規定收買價格，及其以往比率，分別各種油糧之標準價格，呈請行政院核定，故預期今後之油糧，在運營方面、於合理之統一管理下、定能益趨圓滑，而配給米糧粉麥棉花等統收統配辦法、可使整個物資趨於平定。政府安定民生之主旨，更收預期之成效。</p>
<h3>首都展開　國民儲蓄運動　學生團體有款中儲行</h3>
<p>南京十九日中央社電　國民政府爲紀念參戰一週年，使一般國民勵行節約儲蓄美德，以達到節約報國、儲蓄報國，完遂戰爭的目的起見，特展開普遍的國民儲蓄運動。自一月十七日起至廿二日止，定爲節約儲蓄週。各機關·團體·靑少年團·及商店等，並分別組織勸募隊、分頭勸導人民參加節約儲蓄。開始以來，一般市民，皆相繼參加，本社記者為此走訪宣傳部。詢問連日勸導節約儲蓄情形，據悉，本日下午：周市長召集。同業公會，負責人員，於中日文化協會茶會，勸導本市各界勵行節約儲蓄。至於各機關公務人員儲蓄情形，亦正在積極推行中。其他各機關，儲蓄情形如何，因宣傳部尙未接各隊長報吿，一時未能統計。惟宣傳部部內推行儲蓄辦法·大體除個人儲蓄，爲各司室分別開設儲戶，均由各司室職員凑成成數，集體儲蓄。多者一律定三千元，少者至最低限度一千元。雖最低級戰員亦極熱心參加，更由部內推進至所屬各機關，預計將來成績，頗有可觀。</p>
<p>勵行戰時節約儲蓄</p>

<h3>羅君强兼　皖保安司令</h3>
<p>南京十九日中央社電　國民政府頃任命羅君强，兼安徽省保安司令。</p>
<h3>京舞廳　決如期停業</h3>
<p>南京十九日中央社電　首都靑少年爲激於愛國正義，自去歲十二月十七日，發動禁烟賭舞運動以來，業已收穫偉大效果。惟舞塲方面，因驟吿停業，一般生計問題，殊感困難，故呈請政府展限至本月十五日止停業。當時政府為顧念彼等生計，允予展限，至前日已經期滿，故該兩舞廳職工代表周維新周國祥等，前往中國靑少年團總團部，申述决心。今後願以靑年立塲，各盡所能，擁護禁烟賭舞運動，以期淸毒底於成功</p>
<h3>渝通貨膨脹</h3>
<p>里斯本十九日中央社電　據紐約泰晤士實慶特派員訊，長期抗戰下之渝方苦悶情形，及其通貨膨脹之狀况如次：根據重慶所發表者觀，目　物價，較一九三〇年時已漲至百倍，且一部精製品，業達五百倍，較一年前已騰貴八十倍。通貨之膨脹，日爲惡化，其中昆明之物價，較其他各地尤爲昂貴。通貨膨脹，對於民衆生活，有何影響，以記者個人之生活費言，即可窺知一斑。例如記者寓屋之租金，去年一月份爲三百元，但於此一年間，該屋租金已增加爲每月六百元矣·下月或將提漲至九百元。記者所度生活平平，但比較物質生活？準極低之陸屋，渝方官吏，則爲優裕矣。今年渝方各地之農作物情形，除湘粵兩省歉收外，其他各地均甚　稔。渝方經濟幾全部以農產物為標準，故其收穫之良否，殊與渝方財政有深切關係。且對渝方之抗戰力，影響甚大。渝方之工業生產，現正趨向衰落中，重慶市及四週之近代工廠三百六十四家中，已有五十五家停閉，十三家工廠暫停工作。去年湘贛兩省之棉布生產量，雖有增加，但同年之紗廠數竟減少。去年之酒精生產量，雖較前年增加，又煤球產量亦較去年增加百分之十·又其地鑛物之全部生產量顯已　少。去年一年間之鎢　鑛石生產量，較前年激減百分之五十，　之生產量因生產字增加，及巿塲蕭修關係，已在衰落中。滇省之錫鐵於一九二八年間增加一萬七百噸，最高生產量，其後漸次減少，去年僅有二千餘噸之最低生產矣。</p>
<h3>公務員　特種保險　經政院會議通過</h3>
<p>南京十九日中央社電　國府還都以來，一般公務員之薪給，雖經國府多方體恤，實行臨時加俸，惟以物價繼續高漲，其艱困情况，猶未能完全解决。設若遇有意外，或其家屬死亡時，則促樣見肘、應付尤爲困難。值此參戰時期。公務員生活之保陣，工作效率之增進，實爲切要之社會問題。社會福利部有鑒及此，最近時訂定中央公務員特種保險暫行條例，經行政院第一九三次會議通過，對於中央公務員患病殘廢死亡及生產時，均有相當之救助。並聞該部於本月二十日，召開第一次巾央公務員特並保險委員會會議，討論進行事宜。</p>
<h3>首都敎職員　義務助產辦法</h3>
<p>南京十九日中央社電　中國國民黨中央社會部，仰體領袖汪主席德意，舉辦首都敎職員義務助產·其辦法凡屬首都各級學校敎職員之家屬，或爲敎職員本人，行將生產時，均可向該部登記，申請義務助產。</p>
<h3>蘇駐捷大使　呈遞國書</h3>
<p>里斯本十九日中央一社電　據倫敦電稱：捷克亡命政府已於上月十二日與蘇聯簽訂友好互助條約，蘇聯政府根據該約，已任命　貝捷夫爲駐捷大使，該氏已於十八日向貝奈斯總統呈遞國書。</p>
<h3>蘇波邊界糾紛　美願作調人　希望能打開僵局</h3>
<p>里斯本十九日中央社電　據華盛頓消息：美京消息靈通方面相信國務卿赫爾將於數日內，致力於調停蘇波兩國之糾紛，並鼓勵該兩國重新開始蘇波兩國之邊界談判。因疆界問題，乃爲自始之爭點，而蘇眞理報於波蘭之遲疑態度，猛烈更以抨擎。衆信赫爾將不直接指明邊界問題，但將做就兩國間原則上成立協定之先路，其致力於此事之動機，乃因美國民衆重視蘇聯態度之情勢所鼓勵。紐約泰晤士報表明具體之意見，謂眞理報並不拒絕外人之干涉，故此事已成英美之外交上之困難工作。</p>
<p>瑞典京城十九日中央社電據偷敦報紙消息，英外相艾登本日在下院陳述蘇波局勢稱：「吾人之願望爲使兩國獲致友好之解决，此項成就對於歐洲之將來極爲重要，有利之解决尙未絕望，衆信英首相邱吉爾之返倫敦，將使局勢有新發展。」</p>
<p>瑞典京城十九日中央社電蘇聯境內之波蘭報紙發表波蘭西陲之未來界綫，波蘭將包括西里西亞·波麥拉尼亞·及東普魯士，申言上述各省之日耳曼化，不足爲不劃人波闌版圖之理由，但澤之情形亦相同，但該報並未提及波蘭東面之界錢。</p>
<h3>美海軍司令　斯達克抵英</h3>
<p>里斯本十九日中央社電　據英國廣播公司本日播稱：駐歐美海軍總司令斯達克上將，在美京與羅斯福總統及金上將會商　，業已返至倫敦。</p>
<h3>邱吉爾返倫敦　英內閣傳將改組</h3>
<p>瑞典京城十九日中央社電　據北非息路透駐駐阿爾及爾訪員蒲許稱：英首相邱吉爾返抵倫敦、與反軸心軍侵歐計劃有關。邱吉爾於去年十一月間離開倫敦時，侵歐即為其重大心事，但因受二堅之災、致未有充分時間致力於此計劃·渠返倫敦後，即將集中其全副精力於此計劃·邱吉爾病體尙在調養期中，即與反軸心攻歐總司令艾森霍華在瑪拉克斯舉行談話。</p>
<p>瑞典京城十九日中央社電　據海通社訊倫敦消息：英首相邱吉爾返回倫敦後，英內閣行將改組之謠言復起。皮佛勃魯克勛爵或將繼葛里格之後任陸軍大臣，此項謠言倘成事實，則爲皮氏之莫大成功。數月來皮氏已增强其政治地位，邱吉爾療養時期，關員與邱氏爲伴者僅皮氏一而已。</p>
<h3>緬甸空戰日記</h3>
<p>大東亞戰爭進人第三年頭以來，日本駐緬空軍，對抗英渝敵軍的空中作戰，愈演愈烈了。而且是日本飛機所到之地，記者們也都僕僕風塵地追隨着，下面就是近來使人感奮的「基地日記」。　緬甸前綫基地，川手、秦兩特派員正月三日發！</p>
<p>十二月五日</p>
<p>業已成熟的稱穗，在一望無際的田野裘起着波浪。似乎在伸手可及的對面，土紅色的太陽，即將沉入地平綫。某處平原的美麗黃昏，在天空上嗡嗡作嚮着，這是令人懷念的襲擊加爾各答完畢後，歸來的飛機。全憑照射着滑道上的一條光綫，一架一架地降落下來，巨型飛機的姿態，似乎略有倦意。</p>
<p>不久戰鬥機也落下來了。飛機有令人爽快的感覺，其駕駛員也覺得非常令人可親，在夜裏一眼望過去，原來是二十歲左右的少年。</p>
<p>這就是少年飛行兵出身的K上士。這樣一位少年，飛過迢迢的長途，至加爾各答遠征，建立了繫墜敵機的赫赫武功，而高唱着凱歌回來了。在顫動的蠟燭光下，瞬息間打開波羅蜜罐頭，一大堆晚飯，一盌一盌地吃光，記者看到這位健吃的少年，心中不禁流露出一種神秘感覺。</p>
<p>十三日</p>
<p>向田斯治飛機塲去轟炸的戰鬥機與轟炸機連合編隊，在未起飛前、我也曾去送他們，〇〇和〇〇兩位空軍隊長，從面孔上映現着滿意的笑容。在〇〇基地，今天也像平常一樣，一望無限的田野裏全充滿着南國的閃爍燦　陽光，皮膚稍微感覺發凉，這就是緬甸的冬季。一位隊長說：「今天一定成功的，因爲是這樣雄壯的大編隊一。另外一位隊長說：「我也這樣想今天的編隊眞偉大呵！現在去歡送部下飛行員、雄糾糾氣昂的出征姿態，二位隊長就立刻斷定了這一天的勝利。</p>
<p>記者這一天，看到飛機整齊地飛回來，一打聽戰果，據說擎毀敵機三十二架，這才明白兩位隊長的確信，决非是片面的臆斷，而是根據過去無數的經騐，所得出來的銳敏結論。</p>
<p>田斯洽地區的飛機塲，的確是渝印空軍的主要根據地，所以敵方的防衛非常鞏固。這一天，敵機雖然來得晚，但反擊却相常厲害，所以日本歸還株防非常晚的飛機，也曾有多架。部隊長非常自信地說：「今天除掉業已正式知道自炸的兩架飛機外，其他全部都會回來的·」果然，在黑色的夜幕將落下來時，掩護着只剩一個引擎轉的T下士機，受傷的友軍轟炸機，共三架，緩緩地歸返基地了。</p>
<p>部隊長在這一天，在滑走路的傍面草原上佇立着，蹺望着最後一架飛機，前後共費了四小時之久。</p>
<p>十八日</p>
<p>隨軍轟炸昆明去的報道班員，攝影技師Y君，回到基地來大發　隆。對着來迎接他的同事說：</p>
<p>今天和我們同去執行轟炸任務的I準尉機，在自炸的時候，我的精神和注意力，完全被自炸這一事實所吸引　所以對於當時各位勇士的沉着應戰的態度和緊張交綏的嫵面，竟在我的照像機鏡頭上忽略過去了。未得照到全部戰鬥情形，眞是遺憾之至！</p>
<p>十九日</p>
<p>在剛剛天黑的空中飛行着，曾看見很多枝的仙人掌樹（Cactus）在其樹茲下，左一夥右一羣地聚集着刚刚轰炸雲南　飞机塲回来的勇士之黑影。P40型，高射砲，自炸等一连串的话，都是他們談講的資料。總好像，今天曾有過劇烈的戰爭·回到基地來的飛行員，都歡天喜地地相互握着手說：一文見面了！」這正好像碰到了好久沒見的至友一樣。雖然平常總是閑談，然而今天所談的，却是道天戰果之大和作戰之烈。除M中尉機一架自炸外，尙有四架未歸還基地，眞是一件可惜的事·這天晚上，我曾在夢中看到，末歸還飛機，飛一飛、落一落地回來了。</p>
<p>二十二日</p>
<p>再度轟炸昆明而回來的轟炸隊長，向〇部隊長報吿了。U和F兩戰鬥隊長，也相繼降落下來。各自向〇部隊長簡單地報吿後，轟炸與戰鬥各攻擊隊長以及部下，全體包圍着部隊長，相互表示着謝意，以及像朋友一樣高談關論着。</p>
<p>「辛苦辛苦！今天打得眞好。敵人那樣多，反而收獲這樣大，謝謝諸位！」</p>
<p>「不不，實在對不起，竟有兩架自炸·眞糟糕！」</p>
<p>過了一個時間，輕輕地舉起手來，說「再見！」於是各隊長便各自回歸自已的基地了。我總感覺着，自己的熱淚在迸流，心中在强烈地懷念，而臉上也在發熱。（大魯譯自正月五日朝日新聞）</p>

<p>中央社訊　邇來民食供應較暢，黑市漲風巳吿戰止，而一般物價，無論主要及必耍物品之售價，反呈動邊之局勢，値此春節期近，竟發生此種畸形漲風，顯然罔顧法令，遠反限價政策，直接間接，影響整個社會民生至鉅，是以市糧食局特於昨晨十時召集該局所管轄之各業公會、舉行談話會，促使各業共體時艱、嚴禁超越限價。</p>
<p>各業公會被召出席</p>
<p>本市主要及次要各業同業公會，昨晨十時奉令被召出席市糧食局談話會者，計到有糖業公會施揄邨，食用油業公會陳子彝，蛋業公會鄭與源、茶葉業公會張嘉麟、帝產業公會解梅生，鮮猪販賣業公會儲嘉盛，醃臘業公會徐仰喬，水產業公會黃振世，海味業公會葛維庵，南北雜貨業公會汪步新，地貨業公會楊觀祺，酒菜館業公會劉松游，西菜業公會鄙秉庸，調味業公會謝筱初，及麵製熟食業，粉麵業，荳腐業熟水業點心業等五十餘公會。</p>
<p>盲目抬價自食其果</p>
<p>首由該局長紀華起立致辭云；邇來經各方面之協力，民食改善已獲具飛躍之進展，關於物資統制事宜，實業部辦理於先，面糧食部亦切實施行。本市六種主要食品公會均於短時期間成立，而次要食品各公會則由糧局辦理，此後將分別予以調整，蓋每一公會組織之健全與否，關係至鉅，物價問題各業尤應切實注意，値比春節前後，商人盲目抬價，必致自食其果，仰各共體時艱，毋得違反戰時禮制，民生前途，實利賴之。</p>
<p>變更限價定予嚴懲</p>
<p>次由該局秘書主任兼第三科科長黃志愷致詞云：戶口米遞增之結果，業已促使黑市售慣一致趨跌，惟物價則突然畸形上升，殊屬有違本局調整各公會之初衷。本局此後對於物價之評議，自將採取嚴竣之步驟，各業漲價必須經由本局審核，再送評價會决議施行，除商人應得之合法利潤外，不得任意違反，各業公會自應導行，如有陽奉陰違，私自變更限價，一經查悉，定予敵懲。至增加生產各公會，亦應負起是項使命，務使供求平衡。目前物資貧乏，自應極力撙節，是以本局對於非主要製造商，亦將加以限制，酒汽水糖菓餅干及罐頭食品等，悉在限制之列，以符撙節物力之旨，</p>

<h3>碼頭行旅服務處　積極推進工作　擬定招待旅客計劃</h3>
<p>上海爲東亞海陸交通大商埠，但碼頭之秩序、管理之方法、遠不如歐美，實以久爲流氓地痞所盤踞，敲詐欺騙，致旅客或換金錢，或失行李，或遭毆辱，種種擾害、遺笑國際，今社會福利部令中國社會事業協會主辦上海碼頭行旅服務處，積極整頓，並呈請上海市政府給示保護，及盟邦憲軍之協助，已於一月十五日起在九江路二百零二號開始工人登記，近日前往登記者極形踴躍，將來詳細審察，留良汰劣，合格者發給服務證章，且設立守望亭，派定督導人員，常用駐守，訓練工人服務道德，至於招待旅客方面，亦擬定計劃，不日實施：　接送旅客，　代客購票，　代運行李，　代客報關，　代客保險，　代客打包，　嚮導旅客，　代雇車　，　代定艙位，　駁運行李，　　丈量定艙，　　代定旅館，俟上海辦有成效，再推廣至其他各埠。</p>

<h3>評言　如何協助抑壓黑巿？</h3>
<p>戰時統制經濟之下，黑市的存在，終是不能避免的，雖在統制辦得最嚴密的國家，恐怕也不能免於黑市的存在，祇是其範圍之廣狹，與其內容之猖獗與否，則視一個國家辦理統制的成績如何，與其國民協助的程度如何；國家辦理不善，人民協助不力，都足驅黑市於猖獗不可收拾之途。</p>
<p>在本市各種黑市異常猖獗的一個環境下，戶口米自本月下旬起，增配爲二升半，煤球亦將特別增配一個月量，自可對米煤兩種黑市，予以一個相當的打擊。在農歷年關時候，有此一舉，白覺最爲迎合人民心理，祗是，我們希望這種善良的措施，不要把它當作一種應時的禮品，那末，所謂「雙重的喜悅」，方始可以長久盈益於老百姓的胸懷。</p>
<p>上海糧食配給調整委員會委員長爲逐步增配市民食米事所發表的談話中，有過這樣幾句話：「配給之數量前途，大致總可保持目前之水準，惟望市民共同努力以協助當局抑壓黑巿，俾維民生·」那末，今後人民自身的責任，便在於協助當局抑壓黑市了。至於如何協助的地方，則不外於：　勵行節約；在可能範圍以內，必須盡量緊縮一切日常的消耗，　少事購囤；除非感覺配給數量離開水準過遠，勿再一味從事於無限制之購囤。如此一來，物資之供應狀態。旣可圓滑，黑市之猖獗情形，也就可以逐漸消弭了。</p>

<h3>海軍立志（九）  岩田豊雄著　洪羊譯</h3>
<p>眞人將讀完了的書本。覆在書桌上，視綫轉到窗外邊去了。閱覽室的眺望雖是很好，然而瞬息之間·從濃雲密佈的天空，落下大粒的雨點，打在玻璃窗上·高大的楊柳樹、也披上了碧綠的頭蓋。</p>
<p>直到山腰，被雲雨範罩着的櫻島，今天看起來，却異常地暗淡。海上小鳥的影子，也隊現地辨不出眞面目來。天保山·大門口·辨天碼頭·衹園洲等砲臺的附近，烟雨中的屋尖，好像立在大火焰裏一般。</p>
<p>眞人用很奇異地目光，凝視着這新奇的風景。這天氣倒很像蔭英戰爭第一日的景况。而且帶有歷史性的風景，已經不同平常的風景了。十六年來，看慣了的景緻，而能感到這樣地新奇，這不能不說是一件奇事。</p>
<p>彷彿就是這個暗淡的風景，向日本海軍送出了無數的名將似的。在那本書上也寫着，在那次的戰爭，自己的鄕土，確嘗盡了一切的痛苦。常時被呼作荷蘭通的齊彬公歿後，又開始使用火繩槍的老人們，終於不得不承認，火藥被風雨浸濕後，是不堪使用的。圓形彈和錐形彈的成力，是沒有比較的餘地。而且英國，不能斷定他不再前來進攻的。那麼，將來怎麼辦呢？</p>
<p>當這個時候，鄕土的前輩們，不拘於一時的面子和從來的私見，翻然地和英國結合起來，這的確是値得敬服的地方·並非對英國屈服了。確實是在當時歐西軍事科學的優越性之前，而執了師事之禮的——那本書的著者是這樣寫着的·在英國方面，也爲了牽制法國起見，所以這個友好關係，便迅速地成立了。</p>
<p>慶應三年，「勞亞爾親王」號以下三隻英艦，進了鹿兒島港。艦上乘着金提督和巴克斯公使。當時降摩的砲合·也噴着砲火，但那巳經不是戰爭的砲火，而是歡迎的禮砲。藩主主催的歡迎會席上，有四十餘種的菜和香賓酒·英國的客人們，只吃些鷄肉和猪肉做的菜以外，其他的菜，是一點兒也沒動着，香賓和啤酒，却飲用了不少。當時的香賓和啤酒—是在什麼地方得來的？這也看得出款待佳賓的苦心·同時，前輩們並沒忘記，半爲敬意，半爲示威地，試射那中原猶介創造的砲彈，供客人們的觀覽。穿着黑羅紗紅裏的大衣，套着禮服褲的軍官，先向藩主行禮如儀後，向六門的野砲下了射擊的命令，個個都準確的中了遠方海上的標的。英人等也一齊地開始了形勢上的拍手。</p>
<p>這就是眞人前輩們的氣魄。陸海軍都採用了英國式，派遣留學生到英國去，但是他們道種氣魄，是沒有改變的，不久之後，幕府的海軍傳習所，也雇用了英人敎帥。他的後身的海軍兵學寮，幾乎是一個英國海軍學校的縮圖，而且，他的結果呢？</p>
<p>（陸奧長門，是世界最强大的軍艦，隆夫曾這樣說過！）</p>
<p>眞人，又將這暗淡的風景，凝視了一遍·</p>
<h3>國民論壇　淸鄕區的米</h3>
<p>我們住在淸鄕地區的西南隅，戰前　於江蘇省，現在改隸上海市，離產米區只三公里，因一籬之隔（封鎖錢），於是也吃着相當貴價的米。</p>
<p>爲了離產米區近，走私之風大盛，他們的方法用船裝或步担挑，用船裝，只要用「偸天換日」的手段，通過封鎖錢，便堂堂皇皇的通行無阻，冒充本地米，並不是私運過來的，其實內行人一看便知，封鎖綫外和封鎖綫內的米，截然不同，步担呢？往往一大幫在夜間或竟在白天越籬而過，他們都是給饑餓驅來的，眞是毫無辦法。現在產米區內常然也發現黑市，比定價超過約七八成，「一籬之隔」的我們那裘，黑市比定價超過一倍半，將近二關。</p>
<p>到我們那裏一帶看看都是走私市面，如當局决心取締，一舉手便可做到不過我希望當局於决心取締走私之前先要顧到二點，　戶口米應該增到相當數量。　像奉賢南匯川沙北橋等淸鄕地區素來派不到戶口米的，也要替他們想個妥善切實的辦法。（市民）</p>
<h3>寳山區的米</h3>
<p>本巿寳山區此次征收軍米，巿府布吿為每畝一升五合，以政府公定價格每石八百二十元，折合，則每畝計收儲券十二元三角。然而現下實在征收額爲儲券三十九元，合每石一千六百元，浮收竟達三倍以上。敬請市政當局澈查嚴辦，解斯民之倒懸，造功德於無量。（寳山區民衆一份子汪一新）</p>

It is particularly heartbreaking that the Chongqing regime's own mistakes have prevented our country from unifying. However, on the other hand, some people might be thinking: Regardless, the Chongqing regime has finally dragged on the war for six and a half years, doesn't this show their strength?</p>
<p>B: It seems that there are many people who hold this view, right? But the reason why the Chongqing regime has been able to persist for six and a half years can be summarized in one sentence: vast territory, abundant resources, and a large population. The length of the Chinese mainland war front, from Mongolia in the north to Guangzhou Bay and Leizhou Niudao in the south, actually reaches 7,000 kilometers, far exceeding the German-Soviet front; and one province, such as Sichuan, has an area of 455,900 square kilometers, which is far greater than the German mainland.</p>
<p>A: This means that the vast territory is conducive to protracted war, but the saying of abundant resources may not be correct. Isn't the supply of materials in the inland areas extremely scarce?</p>
<p>B: The productivity of the Chongqing regime's area is certainly not comparable to that of Japan and Germany, but because the people live in poverty and have low levels of consumption, the material supply is tight but still barely manageable. In addition, a more important factor is the large population. Based on the vast territory and abundant resources, the Chongqing regime uses the rich "human resources" as its power for protracted war, and also maintains its regime by taking advantage of the enemy, Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>A: So, the Chongqing regime can use these conditions to carry out a persistent protracted war?</p>
<p>B: The issue must be viewed from two perspectives. In the past six and a half years, it has indeed dragged on until now because of the above-mentioned conditions, but at the same time, it should also be recognized that the so-called vast territory already has nearly one-third of the land occupied by the Chinese Communist Party under the banner of "resistance against Japan"; the so-called abundant resources and large population are actually under backward production methods, and at the same time, the huge consumption of protracted war is deteriorating. As a result, the words "general counter-offensive" are no longer heard, and even if they want to hold on firmly, it is extremely difficult. The recent battle of Changde can be a clear example, and even the maintenance of people's livelihood internally is gradually becoming unbearable.</p>
<p>A: Yes, I heard that prices are soaring sharply in various places under the Chongqing regime. Last August, the price of rice was 2,200 yuan per shi (unit of dry measure) in Chongqing, and it had reached 3,200 yuan in Xi'an. Now it is even higher. So, how do the common people live?</p>
<p>B: According to a special dispatch published in the Japanese Asahi Shimbun on January 5, the price index in the Chongqing regime's area was about 81 times that before the incident in January last year. It was 166 times in August, and it had already approached 220 times at the end of the year. The amount of legal tender issued was 1.449 billion yuan before the incident, and it is now estimated to be about 30 billion yuan, with a monthly increase of 1.5 to 2 billion yuan, plus other miscellaneous currencies and bonds totaling about 60 billion yuan; at the same time, due to the increase in military demand and compulsory purchases, the revenue has decreased relatively. The Chongqing regime's budget for the 32nd year is:</p>
<p>The total budget is 30 billion yuan, and the total revenue is 18 billion yuan, which is only 60% of the budget. However, this 30 billion yuan has expanded to 14 and a half times compared to the 2.1 billion yuan in the 26th year before the incident. What other way is there to make up for the insufficient revenue besides issuing public bonds, increasing currency, and begging from the United States?</p>
<p>A: I see! That's why some people say that in Yu Jiang's so-called "Address to the People" on New Year's Day this year, he had to kowtow to Roosevelt in particular.</p>
<p>B: In fact, this is really too pitiful! In the past, it was said that using Anglo-American imperialism to resist Japan was a request for assistance. Now, where is the assistance? Where is the utilization? It is simply relying on the breath of the United States for everything, and obeying the orders of the United States! The United States lends money to control China's economic lifeline. Can Chongqing propose equal conditions? The United States is strengthening its air force in Chongqing to disrupt the rear of East Asia. Can Chongqing demand unified command of military power? It has been shouting for a year and a half, reopening the Yunnan-Burma Road to increase transportation and supply materials from India to Chongqing, but it is still empty talk.</p>
<p>A: In this case, the result of Chongqing's protracted war is that politics is becoming increasingly dark, people's livelihood is becoming increasingly miserable, and it is only creating opportunities for the CCP to occupy. In addition, on the one hand, it boastfully claims to be one of the four great powers, while on the other hand, it allows the military to be completely dominated by the United States, and sits idly by as compatriots are cruelly and brutally bombed without regard. Therefore, compatriots under the rule of Chongqing naturally yearn for peace more eagerly. And the Chongqing regime is really at the end of its rope.</p>
<p>B: Indeed.</p>
<h3>Japanese Naval Air Force Raids Gilbert Islands Airfields and Vigorously Attacks Enemy Positions in New Britain</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) - A Japanese military base in the Central Pacific reports: From the night of the 16th to the morning of the 17th, Japanese naval air forces twice raided enemy airfields and military installations on Tarawa and Makin Islands in the Gilbert Islands despite bad weather, overcoming intense enemy artillery fire and fighter resistance. Tarawa Island's airfield was hit on all sides, with two fires breaking out. The Makin Island airfield and nearby military installations were hit, destroying one location and starting a large fire in another. All Japanese aircraft returned safely to base.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from a Japanese military base in the South Pacific, Japanese naval air forces, in coordination with Japanese ground troops near the enemy landing point in western New Britain, have been vigorously attacking enemy positions for several days. On the morning of the 18th, they attacked enemy positions on Billelo Island and Cape Magas again. Bombs dropped on Billelo Island completely hit enemy ground positions, causing a fire. They also engaged five P40 fighter planes, shooting down one. Bombs dropped over Cape Magas also accurately hit enemy positions. All Japanese aircraft safely returned to base.</p>

<h3>Newly Appointed Minister of Judicial Administration Zhang Yipeng's Speech: All Work Together and Fulfill Their Responsibilities</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency) - After taking office as the Minister of Judicial Administration, Zhang Yipeng, made the following statement: "I am deeply apprehensive about being ordered to take charge of the affairs of the Ministry of Judicial Administration. Fortunately, I am following in the footsteps of Minister Luo, and hopefully I will not fall short and bring shame. The strength of a country lies entirely in its politics. Although judicial administration is only a part of the whole politics, the Ministry of Judicial Administration must be like the arm acting on behalf of the body, and the finger acting on behalf of the arm, in all judicial institutions, and the various institutions within the ministry must also be like the arm acting on behalf of the body, and the finger acting on behalf of the arm. Objectively, the minister has the highest position, descending in levels to the employees, with a distinction between superior and inferior. In reality, each part has its own dedicated responsibility, and each has its own relationship of connection. They support each other, both vertically and horizontally. The manifestation of political strength lies entirely in this. Although official ranks have different levels, everyone must focus on their actual duties, which is no different. While life should be stable, one's mind, body, and work, must be stable. As stated in the first chapter of the Great Learning, 'Knowing where to rest, then one has a fixed point.' The so-called 'knowing where to rest' means fulfilling one's own responsibilities, and 'having a fixed point' means not letting one's mind wander. From a fixed point comes tranquility, and from tranquility comes peace. Thoughts, when put forth, are naturally thorough and meticulous. From thorough and meticulous thinking, then one obtains the effect of doing things. The former Minister Luo has long laid the foundation and promoted great undertakings. The staff will certainly work together and fulfill their responsibilities. I am willing to take full responsibility and will never make things difficult for my colleagues, so as not to affect the stability of their work. Former Minister Luo has taken the position of Governor of Anhui Province. Although the two places are separated, Minister Luo has personally promised that he will continue to assist with the affairs of the ministry, which is something I am deeply grateful for."</p>

<h3>Japanese Postal Savings Exceed 20 Billion Yen</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) - At the beginning of the third year of the decisive battle in the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese people, with a savings target of 27 billion yuan, are actively moving towards the path of saving to serve the country, so the number of savings has been increasing sharply. Among them, the total amount of postal savings from April 1st of last year to the 18th of this month has reached 4.2974 billion yuan. Although there are still more than two months before the end of the national savings period, it has already exceeded the postal savings target of 4.2 billion yuan. This is enough to prove the sincerity of the Japanese people in responding to the soldiers fighting on the front lines and destroying the British and Americans by saving to serve the country. In addition, the total number of postal savings has reached 17.25386 billion yuan as of the 18th, and it is expected to break 20 billion yen in the near future.</p>

<h3>Bose Publishes a Paper, Stating Ten Indicators, "Onward to Delhi" as the Next Move</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 19th (Central News Agency) - Chandra Bose, chairman of the Provisional Government of Free India, published a paper in the Free India newspaper on the 18th, titled "Forward", the gist of which is as follows: Since the beginning of this war, India's independence movement has overcome many obstacles and advanced rapidly. Looking back on the path of India's freedom movement, there have been many stages of progress that can be used as indicators. First, under the guidance of the Indian Independence League, overseas Indians have been organized to support the independence of their motherland from outside India. Second, the formation of the Indian National Army, which is a historical event in the Indian revolution and the most important indicator of India's struggle for freedom. Third, actively engage in political activities under unified guidance. Fourth, to obtain guidance in reorganizing the Indian National Army so that it can be sent to the battlefield for combat as soon as possible. The struggle for freedom has now reached the time of progress, moving further and entering the final stage of the struggle for independence. The establishment of the Provisional Government of Free India is the fifth main indicator. Sixth, Japan and other countries recognize the provisional government, and the countries participating in the Greater East Asia Conference provide a comprehensive guarantee of assistance to India's independence struggle. Therefore, the holding of the Greater East Asia Conference is the seventh stage indicator. Since I took over the leadership of the Indian independence movement in East Asia, I have appointed Nambiar as a minister without portfolio, which proves that Indians in Europe have joined forces with the East Asian independence movement. In turn, a national movement is organized, and the Japanese side has provided various assistance. Once complete contact is established with the independence movement in the motherland, the subsequent actions will be the easiest to guess. Now that a preliminary preparation for moving forward has been completed, the independence movement has leaped towards the path of final victory. Eighth, based on Japan's friendship, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands have been designated as Indian territories, becoming the territory of Free India. The relocation of the government and the Indian National Army to Myanmar has historical importance and will become clearer in the near future. The march to Delhi has ignited a historical struggle. "Crossing the border" is the tenth indicator, so we should use our strength to break through the Indian-Myanmar border and begin the march to Delhi.</p>
<h3>Japan Has Implemented Preparation for Important Industries, Moving to a True Combat Configuration</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) - According to the basic guidelines for enhancing war power and preparing enterprises, the Japanese government has prepared the first type of industrial sectors and is actively promoting the application of textile, rayon factories, and other industries to military needs. The preparation of enterprises in the second type of industrial sectors has also gradually been finalized. At the regular cabinet meeting on the 18th, the Outline of Measures for the Preparation of Enterprises in the Second Type of Industrial Sectors was decided. Important industries related to aircraft, armaments, warships, machinery, and liquid fuel industries are being prepared to strengthen the division of utilization and production, and to refresh and strengthen production functions. This preparation is to move the nation's industries to a true combat configuration. The main points of the outline are recorded as follows: Based on the principle of production first, form a group of cooperative factories centered on government-designated purchasing factories (basic factories), and use factory cooperative organizations and group enterprises to prepare the enterprise system. The Ministries of the Army, Navy, Munitions, Transportation, and Communications will separately demarcate the fields of designated purchasing factories and utilization factories, and seek to adjust purchasing and realize specialized production. In this way, each cooperative factory is a branch factory within an enterprise, and the effectiveness of each group enterprise is obtained. As a result, the integration of the (Indian) production plan and implementation, and the unification and planning of production administration, which have been problems for many years, can be realized. At the time of implementation, it was decided to start with the machinery industry sector and gradually implement the implementation guidelines of each industrial sector rapidly.</p>

<h3>Three Provinces and Two Cities Decide to Implement Unified Management of Oil and Grain, and the Purchase Price Has Been Clearly Defined</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 19th (Central News Agency) - The Material Control Deliberation Committee of the Executive Yuan believes that oil and grain are essential food for daily use and are related to military needs. Under the wartime system, unified management of oil and grain requires not only a strong organization, but also perfect management methods to ensure smooth sources and smooth allocation. This can avoid the various abnormal phenomena of rampant black markets and uneven supply and demand. Therefore, the committee has formulated the Provisional Measures for Unified Management of Oil and Grain, which have been approved by the Executive Yuan and put into effect. In the future, the unified management of oil and grain (including various edible oils and miscellaneous grains, excluding grains and wheat) in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and the two cities of Nanjing and Shanghai, will be the responsibility of the National Commercial Control Association, which will be responsible for the oil and grain professional committee. If necessary, the committee may set up branch offices in various regions so that members of the oil and grain industry associations in various regions can handle the purchase and sale of oil and grain under its leadership. The purchase price has also been clearly stipulated, and the standard prices of various oil and grain should be determined by referring to the stipulated purchase prices of various important agricultural products (such as rice and wheat) and their previous ratios, and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. Therefore, it is expected that the operation of oil and grain in the future will be more smoothly under reasonable unified management, and the unified collection and distribution methods of allocated rice, grain, flour, wheat, cotton, etc. can make the entire material situation stable. The government's main aim of stabilizing people's livelihood will be more effective than expected.</p>
<h3>The Capital Launches a National Savings Movement, and Student Groups Store Money in the Central Reserve Bank</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 19th (Central News Agency) - In order to commemorate the first anniversary of the war, the National Government is launching a universal national savings movement to encourage the general public to practice the virtues of thrift and savings, so as to achieve the goals of saving to serve the country, saving to serve the country, and completing the war. From January 17 to 22, it is designated as Thrift and Savings Week. Various agencies, groups, youth groups, and shops have organized fundraising teams to persuade people to participate in thrift and savings. Since the beginning, the general public has participated one after another. Our reporter visited the Propaganda Department for this purpose to inquire about the situation of encouraging thrift and savings in recent days. It is reported that this afternoon, Mayor Zhou convened professional associations and responsible personnel at a tea party at the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association to encourage all sectors of the city to practice thrift and savings. The savings situation of civil servants in various agencies is also being actively promoted. As for the savings situation of other agencies, it is not possible to count for a while because the Propaganda Department has not yet received reports from the captains of various teams. However, the measures for promoting savings within the Propaganda Department are roughly divided into individual savings, with separate accounts opened for each division and office. The staff of each division and office will pool their numbers and collectively save. The maximum is set at 3,000 yuan, and the minimum is 1,000 yuan. Even the lowest-ranking soldiers are very enthusiastic to participate, and it is also promoted from the department to the subordinate agencies. It is expected that the future results will be quite impressive.</p>

<h3>Luo Junqiang Concurrently Serves as Commander of Anhui Security</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 19th (Central News Agency) - The National Government has recently appointed Luo Junqiang to concurrently serve as the commander of the Anhui Provincial Security.</p>
<h3>Nanjing Dance Halls Decide to Close as Scheduled</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 19th (Central News Agency) - Since the capital's youth were motivated by patriotism and justice and launched the anti-opium, gambling, and dancing movement on December 17 of last year, they have achieved great results. However, the dance hall workers, due to the sudden closure, are having difficulties with their livelihoods, so they petitioned the government to extend the deadline for closure to the 15th of this month. At that time, the government, considering their livelihoods, agreed to extend the deadline. The deadline has already expired the day before yesterday, so the representatives of the two dance halls, Zhou Weixin and Zhou Guoxiang, went to the headquarters of the China Youth Corps to state their determination. In the future, they are willing to stand on the position of youth, do their best to support the anti-opium, gambling, and dancing movement, so as to achieve success in eradicating toxins.</p>
<h3>Chongqing's Inflation</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 19th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from the New York Times special correspondent in Chongqing, the plight of Chongqing under the long-term war of resistance and the state of its inflation are as follows: According to Chongqing's publications, prices have risen a hundredfold compared to 1930, and some fine products have reached five hundredfold, an increase of eightyfold compared to a year ago. Currency inflation is deteriorating day by day, and prices in Kunming are particularly expensive compared to other places. The impact of currency inflation on people's lives can be seen from the reporter's personal living expenses. For example, the rent of the reporter's residence was 300 yuan in January last year, but in this year, the rent has increased to 600 yuan per month, and it may be raised to 900 yuan next month. The reporter's living standard is average, but compared to the extremely low material living standards of the soldiers, the Chongqing officials are better off. The situation of crops in various parts of Chongqing this year is good, except for the poor harvests in Hunan and Guangdong provinces. Chongqing's economy is almost entirely based on agricultural products, so the quality of its harvest is closely related to Chongqing's finances and has a great impact on Chongqing's ability to resist the war. Chongqing's industrial production is currently declining. Among the 364 modern factories in Chongqing and its surrounding areas, 55 have closed and 13 factories have suspended work. Although cotton production in Hunan and Jiangxi provinces increased last year, the number of yarn mills decreased in the same year. Although alcohol production increased last year compared to the previous year, coal production also increased by 10% compared to last year. The total production of minerals in the area has declined significantly. Tungsten ore production decreased sharply by 50% last year compared to the previous year, and antimony production is declining due to increased production and market recession. Tin production in Yunnan Province increased by 10,700 tons in 1928, the highest production volume, which gradually decreased thereafter. Last year, there was only a minimum production of more than 2,000 tons.</p>
<h3>Special Insurance for Civil Servants Approved by the Executive Yuan</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 19th (Central News Agency) - Since the return of the National Government to the capital, the salaries of civil servants have been considered by the National Government in many ways, and temporary salary increases have been implemented. However, due to the continued rise in prices, their difficult situation has not been completely resolved. If there is an accident or the death of a family member, it is even more difficult to cope with. At this time of war, ensuring the livelihood of civil servants and improving their work efficiency is a crucial social problem. In view of this, the Ministry of Social Welfare recently ordered the Provisional Regulations on Special Insurance for Central Civil Servants, which were approved by the 193rd meeting of the Executive Yuan. There is considerable assistance for central civil servants when they are sick, disabled, die, or give birth. It is also heard that the ministry will convene the first meeting of the Special Insurance Committee for Central Civil Servants on the 20th of this month to discuss the implementation of the matter.</p>
<h3>Free Midwifery Program for Teachers in the Capital</h3>

According to the program, when the family members of teachers at all levels of schools in the capital, or the teachers themselves, are about to give birth, they can register with the department and apply for free midwifery.</p>
<h3>Soviet Ambassador to Czechoslovakia Presents Credentials</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 19th (Central News Agency) - According to a London dispatch, the Czechoslovakian government in exile signed a treaty of friendship and mutual assistance with the Soviet Union on the 12th of last month. According to the treaty, the Soviet government has appointed V. Lebedev as the ambassador to Czechoslovakia, and he presented his credentials to President Benes on the 18th.</p>
<h3>Soviet-Polish Border Dispute: The US Willing to Mediate, Hoping to Break the Deadlock</h3>
<p>Lisbon, Central News Agency, 19th – According to Washington sources: Well-informed circles in the US capital believe that Secretary of State Hull will, within a few days, dedicate himself to mediating the dispute between the Soviet Union and Poland and encourage the two countries to restart border negotiations. The border issue has been the point of contention from the start, and the Soviet newspaper *Pravda*'s hesitation regarding Poland has been fiercely criticized. It is widely believed that Hull will not directly specify the border issue but will pave the way for a principled agreement between the two countries. His motivation for dedicating himself to this matter is encouraged by the situation in which the American people value the Soviet Union's attitude. The New York Times expressed a specific opinion, stating that *Pravda* does not reject foreign interference, so this matter has become a difficult task for British and American diplomacy.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Central News Agency, 19th – According to reports in the London newspapers, British Foreign Secretary Eden stated in the House of Commons today regarding the Soviet-Polish situation: "Our wish is to enable the two countries to reach a friendly resolution. This achievement is extremely important for the future of Europe. A favorable resolution is not yet hopeless. It is widely believed that Prime Minister Churchill's return to London will bring new developments to the situation."</p>
<p>Stockholm, Central News Agency, 19th – Polish newspapers within the Soviet Union have published the future border of Poland's western frontier. Poland will include Silesia, Pomerania, and East Prussia, stating that the Germanization of the aforementioned provinces is not a reason for not including them in Poland's territory. The situation in Danzig is the same. However, the newspaper did not mention the eastern border of Poland.</p>
<h3>US Naval Commander Admiral Stark Arrives in England</h3>
<p>Lisbon, Central News Agency, 19th – According to a broadcast by the British Broadcasting Corporation today: Admiral Stark, Commander-in-Chief of the US Naval Forces in Europe, has returned to London after consulting with President Roosevelt and Admiral King in Washington.</p>
<h3>Churchill Returns to London; Rumors of a Cabinet Reshuffle</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Central News Agency, 19th – According to Reuters correspondent Bush in Algiers, North Africa: British Prime Minister Churchill's return to London is related to the Allied invasion plan of Europe. When Churchill left London in November of last year, the invasion of Europe was a major concern for him, but due to two illnesses, he did not have enough time to dedicate himself to this plan. Upon his return to London, he will concentrate all his energy on this plan. Churchill, still recovering from his illness, held talks with Allied Supreme Commander for the Invasion of Europe, Eisenhower, in Marrakesh.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Central News Agency, 19th – According to a report from Havas News Agency, London: Rumors of a British cabinet reshuffle have resurfaced following Prime Minister Churchill's return to London. Lord Beaverbrook may succeed Grigg as Secretary of War. If this rumor becomes reality, it would be a great success for Beaverbrook. Beaverbrook has strengthened his political position in recent months. During Churchill's convalescence, Beaverbrook was the only official who accompanied Churchill.</p>
<h3>Burma Air War Diary</h3>
<p>Since the start of the third year of the Greater East Asia War, the air battles between the Japanese air force stationed in Burma and the British and American enemy forces have intensified. Wherever Japanese planes go, reporters follow them, and the following is a "base diary" that has been inspiring recently. Burmese front-line base, sent by special correspondents Kawate and Qin on January 3rd!</p>
<p>December 5th</p>
<p>The ripened rice ears create waves in the boundless fields. The reddish-brown sun seems to be sinking into the horizon within arm's reach. Somewhere in the plain, the beautiful evening is buzzing in the sky. These are the planes returning after completing the raid on Calcutta, bringing back memories. Relying entirely on the single beam of light illuminating the runway, one plane after another lands. The posture of the giant planes seems slightly weary.</p>
<p>Soon, the fighter planes also land. The planes have a refreshing feel, and their pilots are very approachable. Looking at them in the night, they turn out to be young men around twenty years old.</p>
<p>This is Staff Sergeant K, who came from the ranks of young airmen. This young man flew over a long distance to the expedition in Calcutta, established glorious military achievements by shooting down enemy planes, and returned singing triumphantly. Under the flickering candlelight, he instantly opens a jackfruit can, and devours a large pile of dinner bowl after bowl. Seeing this hearty-eating young man, the reporter cannot help but feel a sense of mystery.</p>
<p>December 13th</p>
<p>Before the fighter and bomber joint formation took off for the bombing of the Myitkyina airfield, I also went to see them off. Both air force captains, 〇〇 and 〇〇, had satisfied smiles on their faces. At the 〇〇 base, today, like usual, the boundless fields are filled with the sparkling sunlight of the southern country. The skin feels slightly cool, which is the winter in Burma. One captain said: "Today we will definitely succeed, because it is such a magnificent large formation." Another captain said: "I think so too. Today's formation is truly great!" Now, they are going to cheer on the subordinate pilots. The captains immediately determined the victory of this day due to the courageous and high-spirited attitude of the departing pilots.</p>
<p>On this day, the reporter saw the planes flying back neatly. Upon inquiring about the battle results, it was said that 32 enemy planes were destroyed. Only then did I understand that the two captains' conviction was by no means a one-sided conjecture but rather a sharp conclusion drawn from countless past experiences.</p>
<p>The airfield in the Myitkyina area is indeed the main base of the American and Indian air forces, so the enemy's defense is very solid. Although the enemy planes came late on this day, the counterattack was quite fierce, so several Japanese planes returned to the base very late. The unit commander confidently said: "Today, in addition to the two planes that we already officially know self-destructed, all the others will return." Sure enough, as the black curtain of night was about to fall, shielding the T enlisted man's plane with only one engine turning, three injured Allied bombers slowly returned to the base.</p>
<p>On this day, the unit commander stood on the grassland beside the runway, watching the last plane, for a total of four hours.</p>
<p>December 18th</p>
<p>The reporter from the news team who went to bomb Kunming, photography technician Mr. Y, returned to the base and started complaining. To his colleagues who came to greet him, he said:</p>
<p>"When the I warrant officer's plane that went with us to carry out the bombing mission self-destructed today, my spirit and attention were completely attracted by the fact that it was self-destruction, so I overlooked the calm attitude of the warriors at that time and the intense scene of the battle in my camera lens. It is really a pity that I did not get to photograph the entire battle situation!"</p>
<p>December 19th</p>
<p>Flying in the sky just as it was getting dark, I saw many cactus trees. Under the trees, they gathered in groups, one group on the left and one group on the right. These were the black shadows of the warriors who had just returned from bombing the Yunnan airfield. P40 type, anti-aircraft guns, self-destruction, etc., were all the topics they were talking about. It seemed that there had been a fierce war today. The pilots who returned to the base happily shook hands with each other and said, "We meet again!" This was just like meeting close friends who had not been seen for a long time. Although they always chatted casually, what they talked about today was the great battle results and the fierceness of the battle. Apart from Lieutenant M's plane self-destructing, there were still four planes that had not returned to the base, which was a pity. That night, I dreamed that the planes that had not returned were flying back, flying and landing.</p>
<p>December 22nd</p>
<p>The bombing squad leader who returned from bombing Kunming again reported to Unit Commander 〇. The two fighter squad leaders, U and F, also landed one after another. After each briefly reporting to Unit Commander 〇, the bombing and fighter attack squad leaders, as well as their subordinates, all surrounded the unit commander, expressing their gratitude to each other and discussing matters like friends.</p>
<p>"Well done! You fought very well today. There were so many enemies, but the harvest was so great. Thank you all!"</p>
<p>"No, no, I'm really sorry that two planes self-destructed. It's terrible!"</p>
<p>After a while, he lightly raised his hand and said, "Goodbye!" Then the squad leaders returned to their respective bases. I always feel my hot tears bursting out, my heart longing intensely, and my face burning up. (Translated by Da Lu from the Asahi Shimbun, January 5)</p>

<h3>Food Bureau Strictly Prohibits Exceeding Price Limits; Convenes Discussions with Various Industries; Sharing the Burden, No Violation of Control Policies Allowed</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report: Recently, the supply of food for the people has been relatively smooth, and the surge in the black market has stopped. However, the prices of general goods, whether essential or necessary items, have shown a trend of instability. As the Spring Festival approaches, this kind of abnormal price increase has occurred, which clearly disregards the law and violates the price limit policy. It has a direct and indirect impact on the entire social livelihood. Therefore, the Municipal Food Bureau specially convened a discussion meeting with the industry associations under its jurisdiction at 10:00 am yesterday to promote that all industries share the burden and strictly prohibit exceeding price limits.</p>
<p>Industry Associations Summoned to Attend</p>
<p>The industry associations of various major and secondary industries in the city that were summoned to attend the discussion meeting of the Municipal Food Bureau at 10:00 am yesterday included Shi Yucun of the Sugar Industry Association, Chen Ziyi of the Edible Oil Industry Association, Zheng Yuyuan of the Egg Industry Association, Zhang Jialin of the Tea Industry Association, Xie Meisheng of the Mattress Industry Association, Chu Jiasheng of the Fresh Pork Sales Industry Association, Xu Yangqiao of the Cured Meat Industry Association, Huang Zhenshi of the Aquatic Products Industry Association, Ge Weian of the Seafood Industry Association, Wang Buxin of the North and South Groceries Industry Association, Yang Guanqi of the Local Products Industry Association, Liu Songyou of the Restaurant Industry Association, Bi Bingyong of the Western Restaurant Industry Association, Xie Xiaochu of the Seasoning Industry Association, as well as more than 50 associations such as the Noodle Production and Cooked Food Industry, Flour Noodle Industry, Tofu Industry, Cooked Water Industry, and Dim Sum Industry.</p>
<p>Blindly Raising Prices Backfires</p>
<p>First, Bureau Chief Ji Hua stood up and said: "Recently, with the cooperation of all parties, the improvement of food for the people has made great progress. The Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Food have been implementing matters related to material control. The six major food associations in the city were established in a short period of time, and the various secondary food associations are handled by the Food Bureau. These will be adjusted separately in the future. The soundness of each association's organization is of great importance. All industries should pay close attention to the price issue. Before and after the Spring Festival, merchants blindly raise prices, which will inevitably backfire. I hope that everyone will share the burden and not violate wartime regulations. The future of the people's livelihood depends on it."</p>
<p>Changing Price Limits Will Be Severely Punished</p>
<p>Next, Huang Zhikai, Secretary and Chief of the Third Section of the Bureau, said: "The result of the increase in household rice allocation has already prompted the black market prices to fall. However, commodity prices have suddenly risen abnormally, which is contrary to the original intention of the Bureau to adjust various associations. The Bureau will take strict steps in the evaluation of commodity prices in the future. Price increases in all industries must be reviewed by the Bureau and then sent to the Evaluation Committee for a resolution before implementation. In addition to the legal profits that merchants should receive, they must not arbitrarily violate them. All industry associations should guide and implement this. If there are any violations or private changes to the price limits, they will be severely punished once discovered. All associations that increase production should also take on this mission to ensure that supply and demand are balanced. At present, materials are scarce, so we should try our best to conserve. Therefore, the Bureau will also restrict non-major manufacturers. Alcohol, soda, candy, biscuits, and canned food are all restricted to meet the purpose of conserving material resources."</p>
<h3>60th Period Rice Flour to Be Sold Universally Starting Tomorrow; 2.5 Sheng of Japonica Rice, 1 Jin of Grade 1 Flour</h3>

Those with the 60th flour purchase certificate can purchase 1 jin of Grade 1 flour for 8 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes. The sale of rice for this period will last until the 30th of this month, but all rice shops will be temporarily closed for four days on January 25th, 26th, 27th, and 31st. The regulations in this announcement do not apply to the territories newly incorporated into the district.</p>
<p>Three Periods of Matches Sold Simultaneously</p>
<p>Regarding the third period of matches, it is also scheduled to begin selling tomorrow (21st). All retail stores should sell a small box of "Golden Tripod Brand" or "Jinjiang Brand" or "Dahua Brand" matches for 1 yuan in national currency upon receiving each coupon marked with the store's registration number. If any retail store is found to be in violation of the regulations, they can report it to the nearest police station for investigation. The retail stores will be temporarily closed on the 25th, 26th, and 27th.</p>
<h3>Deputy Director Su Gave Instructions to Inspectors Yesterday</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report: The First Police Bureau of the city has been actively improving the police administration and rectifying police discipline. Now, it is determined to strengthen the organization of the Inspectorate to meet the responsibilities of police inspection and investigation. Mr. Su Chengde, Deputy Director of the Bureau, convened all the chief inspectors and inspectors at the Police Club of the Bureau at 4:00 pm yesterday (19th) to give instructions.</p>
<h3>Deputy Director Su's Personal Instructions</h3>
<p>He stated: "The work of the Inspectorate in the past has not been able to fully meet the requirements of police inspection and investigation, which has led to dissatisfaction with the police from the outside world. It is very regrettable. You must know that the establishment of the Inspectorate occupies a very important position in the Bureau. It is necessary to strictly supervise and inspect the police, and even teach the police, so that every police officer abides by discipline, assumes responsibility, follows police ethics, maintains law and order for the society, and benefits the people. Especially after the recovery of the concessions, we must improve the police affairs more accurately, to complete the construction of Greater Shanghai, so that we will not fail the sincerity of the Allied countries in assisting in the return of the concessions. In the future, we should lead by example, be a model for the police, and work hard together regardless of nationality. But we must be honest and law-abiding ourselves before we can encourage others. In short, I hope that everyone will work together to make Shanghai a model police area. In order to strengthen the organization of the Inspectorate and achieve the effect of division of labor and cooperation, it has been decided to add three groups to the Inspectorate: administrative, inspection, and investigation, and to establish five inspection areas: central, eastern, southern, western, and northern. All inspectors will be mixed and deployed, regardless of nationality, day and night, to work hard to check and supervise the work, so that the police work can be guaranteed from top to bottom. The personnel of the group area will be announced within a few days after adjustment."</p>
<p>Mr. Wen Ting has served the community and is enthusiastic about public welfare, but he is old and his energy cannot bear the heavy burden. For the sake of public rest, colleagues have requested from all walks of life last year that they should not be invited to banquets. Lan Lao has been happy about this for half a year. Recently, Zha Lao has been burdened by the matter of officiating weddings. Every auspicious day, several weddings a day cost time and effort, and he feels very distressed. Therefore, colleagues would like to respectfully inform Lan Lao's friends that he should not be asked to officiate weddings. Sincerely hope. South, Zhang Yipeng, Chen Binhe, together, January 17</p>
<h3>Dockside Travel Service Actively Promotes Work; Formulates Plans to Welcome Travelers</h3>
<p>Shanghai is a large commercial port for land and sea transportation in East Asia, but the order of the docks and the methods of management are far inferior to those in Europe and America. This is because they have long been occupied by hooligans and gangsters who extort and deceive, causing travelers to lose money or luggage, or be beaten and insulted. All kinds of disturbances make the international community laugh. Now, the Ministry of Social Welfare has ordered the China Social Work Association to organize the Shanghai Dockside Travel Service to actively rectify the situation and has requested the Shanghai Municipal Government to provide protection and assistance from the Allied military police. Worker registration began on January 15th at 202 Jiujiang Road. Recently, those who have gone to register have been very enthusiastic. In the future, they will be carefully examined, retaining the good and eliminating the bad. Qualified people will be issued service badges, and guard posts will be set up with supervisors assigned to regularly stay. Workers will be trained in service ethics. As for welcoming travelers, plans have also been formulated and will be implemented soon: Receiving and sending off travelers, Purchasing tickets for customers, Transporting luggage for customers, Clearing customs for customers, Insuring for customers, Packing for customers, Guiding travelers, Hiring cars for customers, Booking cabins, Transporting luggage by lighter, Measuring and booking cabins, Booking hotels. Once Shanghai has achieved success, it will be promoted to other ports.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Press Department Held Regular Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report: The regular press meeting held by the Japanese Army Press Department in Shanghai was held as usual yesterday (19th) at 3:00 pm on the eighth floor of the Cathay Hotel on the Bund, Nanjing Road. The spokesperson of the department answered the questions raised by the press corps in the city in detail. The meeting did not end until around 5:00 pm.</p>
<h3>Canal Management Preparatory Office Entertained Various Circles Yesterday</h3>
<p>In order to establish close contact with various circles in the city, the Canal Management Preparatory Office held a tea party at the Cathay Hotel on the eighth floor at 4:00 pm yesterday, entertaining Chinese and Japanese officials and celebrities from all walks of life. Section Chief Ru Geng, along with Secretary Ren Santian, Planning Group Leader Lin Gengyu, and others, cordially hosted the event.</p>
<h3>Shenbao's 6th Student Aid Fund; Various Circles Enthusiastically Donate; Junior High School Second-Year Students Register Today</h3>
<p>The newspaper was released at 7:30 yesterday. The 6th Shenbao Readers' Student Aid Fund has been organizing application registrations in groups since the 17th and will be completely closed on the 22nd. During this period, it has been enthusiastically promoted by various circles, and the enthusiastic donations are deeply inspiring. The numbers cannot be said to be small, but in terms of distribution, they are much shorter than in previous sessions. The sharp increase in tuition fees and the increase in the number of applicants, with an average aid of 500 yuan per person, means that the existing aid funds are only enough for 5,000 people. The remaining more than twice as many students will not be able to receive assistance. Although donations can still be obtained from various circles, the current situation has made colleagues hesitate to start distributing the funds. The original target of the current session of the newspaper's student aid fund was 3 million yuan. In addition to the balance from the previous session, only half of that amount has been obtained so far. Seeing the students coming to apply, their urgent need for help is very sympathetic. The purpose of student aid is to be universal. Among the more than 16,000 applicants, we cannot bear to see even one person being rejected. While colleagues are doing their best, we deeply hope that enthusiastic people will pay special attention to the current student aid fund, generously donate to complete the project, and offer sincere prayers.</p>
<p>Application Forms for Junior High School Second-Year Students Will Be Accepted Starting Today. Each student must fill out the form item by item and pay attention to affixing the seal of the school authority and the guarantor, as well as other required procedures, to avoid trouble at the last minute.</p>
<p>Forms Submitted by Schools in Batches</p>
<p>Because the current session is in a hurry during the winter vacation and also coincides with the New Year holidays, the newspaper must speed up the handling of various student aid affairs. Please make sure that all students complete the registration procedures within the specified date. If it is not allowed by the facts and the report card has not been issued yet, they can wait until the scores are available and have the school authorities send them together to complete the registration.</p>
<p>Guangdong Public Association Aiding Fellow Villagers</p>
<p>The Shanghai Guangdong Public Association will provide a student aid fund of 20,500 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes from its school operating expenses to cultivate talent and help poor fellow villagers from Guangdong Province, Guangzhou City, and Zhaoqing who are willing to study agriculture and engineering. The association has entrusted Mu to handle this. All those who have received limited applications for student aid from this association are eligible to apply, which is worthy of emulation.</p>
<p>Social Figures Donate One After Another</p>
<p>Yesterday, Mr. Zhu Zhenhua, Mr. Xu Xingsheng, and Mr. Chen Zuoting each generously donated 10,000 yuan to the student aid fund. Mr. Lu Hanbang and Mr. Qu each donated 5,000 yuan. Their concern for the poor is deeply admirable.</p>
<p>Yesterday, we received letters from Mr. Yu Yixin and Mr. Zhang Yi'e, which stated: "Your newspaper's student aid program has achieved remarkable results, benefiting the poor and making a great contribution. We are ordinary store employees with meager monthly incomes, and we cannot help much. Now, we are sending 1,000 yuan to your newspaper's student aid fund. This is a small amount, but it represents our heart." The feelings are sincere, and the enthusiasm is admirable.</p>
<p>The China Radio Friendship Society held an anniversary rehearsal at the Golden Grand Theater on the 16th of this month. The gifts sent by various circles were converted into cash to donate 1,950 yuan to the newspaper's student aid fund, saving waste to help students, which is of great significance.</p>
<p>Student Aid Fund Received Yesterday</p>
<p>The following is a list of student aid funds received yesterday: Guangdong Public Association 20,500 yuan, Zhu Zhenhua 10,000 yuan, Xu Xingsheng 10,000 yuan, Chen Zuoting 20,000 yuan, Lu Hanbang and Qu each 5,000 yuan, Pudong Bank 4,000 yuan, Chen Xinchang, Liang Guanliu, and Chen Weifu jointly 3,000 yuan, Gongzhu Liu Shangtang's 60th birthday celebration transferred to Jiang Xue each 3,000 yuan, Zhang Yisun 2,000 yuan, China Radio Friendship Society 1,950 yuan, Song Jalu 1,080 yuan, Wu Rende, Ma Jinzhang, Lu Xianzhang, Li Jingting, Zhuang Pushu, Zhou Manhua, Hu Yangwu, Yan Ji, Zhe Ji, Xue Ji (above two households raised by Mr. Chen Duoru) each 1,000 yuan, Xu Xinfu, Fan Huichun, Ye Jingliang jointly 1,000 yuan, Zhong Jun 530 yuan, Wu Yaozhong, Yu Yixin, Zhang Yi'e, Sheng Fanfu, Shen Xuan, Xia Shengfeng, Fan Wenxin, Wang Juju, Ms. Zhang Shaozhen each 500 yuan, Gu, Nie, Wang, Shi, Nie, Zhang, Liu, Nie, Shi jointly 500 yuan, Zhang Zhihong, Shen Weiqing jointly 500 yuan, Zhong Boyi 400 yuan, Heji 382 yuan, Fan Wen 300 yuan, Ruichang Cloth Store, Qiu Yunzhang, Zhao Weixin, Chen Shanzhang, Li Zhaolan, Zhao Yang, Chen Shao each 200 yuan, Ms. Liu Xiuzhen 120 yuan, Xi Dingfu, Zhao Yinchang, Zhao Maochang, Luo Zilin, Zhu Gengfu, Gao Meng , Wang Xincun, Huai Songtang, Shen Huiping, Chunyuan Qianzhuang each 100 yuan, Shi Da 25 yuan, Pu Qiting 10 yuan, totaling 99,197 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes.

<h3>Commentary: How to Help Suppress the Black Market?</h3>
<p>Under wartime controlled economy, the existence of a black market is ultimately unavoidable. Even in countries with the most stringent controls, it is probably impossible to avoid the existence of a black market. It is just a matter of the breadth of its scope and the degree of its rampantness, which depends on the success of a country's control efforts and the degree of cooperation from its citizens. Poor government management and lack of public cooperation are both sufficient to drive the black market to a rampant and uncontrollable path.</p>
<p>In an environment where various black markets in the city are unusually rampant, the increase in household rice allocation to 2.5 sheng from the end of this month and the special increase in coal ball allocation for one month can have a considerable impact on the black markets for rice and coal. At the time of the Lunar New Year, this move is most welcome to the people's psychology. However, we hope that this kind of good measure should not be regarded as a timely gift. Only then can the so-called "double happiness" forever benefit the people's hearts.</p>
<p>The chairman of the Shanghai Grain Rationing Adjustment Committee made the following remarks in his speech on the gradual increase in the allocation of food rice to the citizens: "The future quantity of rationing can generally maintain the current level, but I hope that the citizens will work together to assist the authorities in suppressing the black market, so as to maintain the people's livelihood." Then, the responsibility of the people themselves in the future lies in assisting the authorities in suppressing the black market. As for how to assist, it is nothing more than: Practicing thrift; within the scope possible, we must try our best to tighten all daily consumption. Buy and hoard less; unless the rationing quantity feels too far from the standard, do not engage in unlimited buying and hoarding. In this way, the supply of materials can be smooth, and the rampant situation of the black market can be gradually eliminated.</p>
<h3>Regulations for Deferred Payment Promissory Notes in Various Industries, Approved for Implementation by the Financial Inspection Office</h3>
<p>Following instructions from the Financial Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Bank of China, various banking and financial institutions, in order to stabilize the financial situation, have been restricting deferred payment promissory notes. The respective trade associations of these two sectors proposed four measures and sent representatives to present their views, hoping they would be adopted and implemented. According to inquiries made by reporters yesterday to banking and financial institutions, the Financial Affairs Inspection Office has adopted these views, approved accommodating measures, and sent a letter to the Banking and Financial Institutions Association, instructing member institutions to comply. Under the principle of restricting deferred payment promissory notes, all financial institutions that must issue deferred payment promissory notes due to borrowing funds from other institutions or other unavoidable business reasons must record the following items according to Article 27 of Chapter 3 of the Bills Law, signed by the issuer: the term "promissory note," a fixed amount, the name or business name of the payee, an unconditional guarantee of payment, the place and date of issuance, and the place of payment and due date. As for the promissory note format, it has been drafted by the association and approved by the Financial Affairs Inspection Office.</p>
<h3>Tight Credit at the End of the Lunar Year, Lackluster Performance of Chinese Stocks, China Bookstore Uniquely Soars and Does Not Fall Back</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trend of Chinese stocks was the same as the previous day. Prices fell in the morning without rebounding, and gradually stabilized and strengthened in the afternoon. Due to the end of the lunar year, it is difficult to expect credit to ease temporarily, resulting in a lack of momentum for prices to rise. The stocks of various industries generally experienced small declines again. Only the China Bookstore in the cultural industry soared twenty yuan amidst rumors of capital increase. Commercial Press, on the other hand, fell back a significant one hundred fifty yuan. China Film and other stocks remained stable. Wing On and other department stores each fell by small amounts of three to two and a half yuan! Wing On Textile Factory fell by a small amount of two and a half yuan; Sino-Textile was the weakest. Pharmaceutical stocks declined, with Sino-French retreating close to the seventy yuan mark. Chemical stocks also proved unsustainable. Public utility stocks remained unchanged as before. Among real estate stocks, Jianlong was uniquely strong. Other stocks such as Kang Yuan Canned Food, Lihua Industrial, and New Asia Construction also saw small declines. Today's closing prices for each stock are recorded below: Stock Name, Evening Closing Price: Commercial Press 5,450.00; China Bookstore 575.00; World Bookstore 138.00; China Film 92.50; Wing Cheung Printing 26.50; Wing On Company 237.50; Sun Sun Company 155.00; National Goods Company 159.00; New China Company 24.75; China Underwear 68.50; Wing On Textile Factory 230.00; Sino-Textile Factory 93.00; Xinhe Textile Factory 98.00; Rongfeng Textile 90.50; Renfeng Dyeing and Weaving 78.00; Tongfeng Printing and Dyeing 28.00; Wuhe Weaving 77.00; Lunhua Dyeing and Weaving 66.50; Jingfu Shirt and Socks 38.75; Jinglun Shirt and Socks 28.50; China Silk Industry 477.50; Mayer Silk Weaving 300.00; Sino-French Pharmacy 71.00; Synte Pharmaceutical Factory 505.00; New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory 35.50; New One Line 21.25; Star Perfume 44.50; Great China Match 750.00; Senmao Chemical 27.00; Nanyang Tobacco 760.00; Standard Flavoring 17.25; Gongxin Electric 20.00; Kang Yuan Canned Food 101.00; Shanghai Enterprise 17.25; Datong Business 25.00; Jiu'an Industrial 41.25; Lihua Industrial 57.00; New Asia Construction 29.00; New China Industrial 24.50; Zhongxing Zhenye 17.25; Quanfeng Real Estate 22.25; Jianlong Real Estate 22.75; New Yih Real Estate 27.75; Yongyu Real Estate 36.50; Lianhua Real Estate 35.00</p>

<h3>Naval Ambition (9) by Iwata Toyoo, translated by Hong Yang</h3>
<p>Zhenren put down the book he had finished reading on the desk and turned his gaze out the window. The view from the reading room was excellent, but in an instant, large raindrops fell from the heavily clouded sky, hitting the windowpanes. The tall willow trees were also covered with a green cap.</p>
<p>Sakurajima, covered in clouds and rain up to its waist, looked unusually dim today. The shadows of seabirds were also indistinguishable. Near the Tenpozan, Daimon, Benten Pier, and Gion Island fortresses, the tips of the houses in the misty rain seemed to be standing in a great flame.</p>
<p>Zhenren stared at this novel scene with a very strange gaze. This weather was very similar to the conditions on the first day of the Anglo-Satsuma War. Moreover, the historical scenery was different from the usual scenery. It was a strange thing to be able to feel such novelty in the scenery that he had become accustomed to seeing for sixteen years.</p>
<p>It seemed that this dim scenery had sent countless famous generals to the Japanese Navy. The book also wrote that his hometown had certainly suffered all kinds of pain during that war. After the death of Lord Nariakira, who was often called "Dutch Expert," the old men who had started using matchlock guns again finally had to admit that gunpowder was unusable after being soaked by wind and rain. There was no room for comparison between the power of round bullets and conical bullets. Moreover, England could not be certain that it would not come to attack again. So, what would happen in the future?</p>
<p>At this time, the seniors in his hometown, without being bound by temporary face-saving or traditional prejudices, turned around and allied themselves with England. This was indeed worthy of respect. It was not a submission to England. It was certainly before the superiority of Western military science at the time that they performed the ceremony of apprenticeship—the author of the book wrote this. On the English side, this friendly relationship was quickly established in order to check France.</p>
<p>In Keio 3 (1867), three English warships, including the "Royal Prince" vessel, entered Kagoshima Port. Aboard were Admiral King and Minister Parkes. At that time, the forts of Shimazu were also firing cannons, but they were no longer the cannons of war, but rather welcome salutes. At the welcoming banquet hosted by the feudal lord, there were more than forty kinds of dishes and champagne. The English guests only ate chicken and pork dishes, and did not touch the other dishes at all, but they drank a lot of champagne and beer. Where did the champagne and beer at that time come from? This also showed the painstaking efforts to entertain the distinguished guests. At the same time, the seniors did not forget to demonstrate the trial firing of the cannonballs created by Nakahara Yunosuke, half out of respect and half to show off, for the guests to observe. Wearing black wool red-lined coats and dress trousers, the officers first saluted the feudal lord and then ordered the six field guns to fire. Each one accurately hit the target far out at sea. The English also began to applaud in unison.</p>
<p>This was the spirit of Zhenren's seniors. The army and navy both adopted the British style, and dispatched students to England, but their kind of spirit did not change. Soon after, the Tokugawa shogunate's naval training school also hired English teachers. His successor, the Naval Academy, was almost a miniature of a British naval school, and, what was the result?</p>
<p>(Mutsu and Nagato were the most powerful warships in the world, Ryufu once said this!)</p>
<p>Zhenren stared at this dim scenery again.</p>
<h3>National Forum: Rice in the Qingxiang Area</h3>
<p>We live in the southwestern corner of the Qingxiang area, which was formerly in Jiangsu Province and is now under the jurisdiction of Shanghai Municipality. We are only three kilometers away from the rice-producing area, but because of the blockade line, we are also eating relatively expensive rice.</p>
<p>Because of its proximity to the rice-producing area, smuggling is rampant. Their methods involve using boats or shoulder poles. When using boats, they simply use the "trick of swapping the sky for the sun" to pass through the blockade line and proceed unimpeded, masquerading as local rice and claiming that it was not smuggled. In fact, insiders can tell at a glance that the rice outside the blockade line is completely different from the rice inside the blockade line. As for shoulder poles, a large group of people often cross the fence at night or even during the day. They are all driven by hunger and truly have no other choice. Currently, black markets are also frequently found in the rice-producing areas, exceeding the fixed price by about 70% to 80%. In our area, which is separated by "a single fence," the black market exceeds the fixed price by one and a half times, approaching two times.</p>
<p>If you take a look at our area, you'll see mostly smuggling markets. If the authorities are determined to crack down, they can do so with a single move. However, before the authorities resolve to crack down on smuggling, I hope they will consider two points: 1. The amount of household rice should be increased to a substantial quantity. 2. For Qingxiang areas such as Fengxian, Nanhui, Chuansha, and Beiqiao, which have never received household rice allocations, they should also devise a proper and practical solution. (Citizen)</p>
<h3>Rice in Baoshan District</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipality has announced that the military rice levy in Baoshan District will be 1.5 liters per mu, calculated at the government-fixed price of 820 yuan per shi, which amounts to 12.3 yuan in storage coupons per mu. However, the actual levy is 39 yuan in storage coupons, equivalent to 1,600 yuan per shi, an overcharge of more than three times. We respectfully request the municipal authorities to thoroughly investigate and strictly handle this matter, relieving the people from their dire straits and performing boundless good deeds. (A Baoshan District resident, Wang Yixin)</p>
<h3>This Newspaper Issues Scholarship Honor Vouchers, Valid from the Lunar New Year's Day</h3>
<p>Since this newspaper exclusively contracted the Kuguan Troupe to perform a charity performance for scholarships, we have been deeply gratified to receive support from all walks of life. The Kuguan Troupe will present the comedy "Double Happiness at the Door" day and night at the Palais Theater starting from the Lunar New Year's Day. The plot is full of twists and turns, and the performance is lighthearted, which will surely create a sensation in the artistic world. This newspaper is issuing 1,000 "Scholarship Honor Vouchers," each ten vouchers bound together in a booklet, with each voucher sold for 200 yuan. After deducting the new seat price of 80 yuan, an additional 120 yuan will be donated to the "Scholarship Fund." These vouchers are beautifully printed, making them particularly sincere gifts for relatives and friends. Both watching a famous play and contributing to scholarships can be said to be a win-win situation. Moreover, these vouchers are valid for general use within three months. Currently, in addition to this newspaper and the Kuguan Troupe separately promoting sales, if enthusiastic people from all walks of life are willing to purchase, please contact the business department of this newspaper. The names of all purchasers will be published in the newspaper to demonstrate credibility. The brief rules for the honor vouchers are listed below: 1. During the Kuguan charity performance period, purchasers can use this voucher to reserve the best seat at the Palais Theater. (The charity performance period runs until the end of March 1944). 2. Purchasers of this voucher must reserve their seats three days in advance and must state that it is an honor voucher. If the seat reservation is made too late and the show is sold out, please change to a seat for another show. 3. When reserving an honor seat, please provide your address so that the seat voucher can be delivered and the honor voucher can be collected for verification. 4. The Palais Theater will reserve the best seats for each show specially for voucher purchasers, but the seats will be held until three hours before the show at the latest, after which they will be released. (Those who have reserved seats are not subject to this rule). 5. Purchasers of this voucher will not be required to pay any additional entry fees. 6. The names of those who purchase a full booklet of these vouchers will be published in the Shen Bao one after another for commemoration.</p>
