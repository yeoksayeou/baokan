<h3>消滅暴利主義</h3>
<p>本市第一警察局經濟保安處成立以後，因爲與經濟界本身有密切關係，所以工商界人士對之表示非常關心，寄以非常期待。本報爲溝通當局與經濟界之意見，曾邀集有資望人士舉行座談會，以期待經濟保安處問題爲中心，發表意見，茲已整理就緒，揭載今日本報第三版，這在經濟保安處當局以及工商界同人，諒必樂於一讀。</p>
<p>綜合各方面意見，約可歸納爲如次數要點：</p>
<p>經濟保安處執行一切法令，應詳明公布，使人民瞭解，知所遵守。</p>
<p>對於違法事件，如情節輕者，與同業公會聯絡，加以勸吿，予以改過自新機會。情節重者，移送法院辦理。</p>
<p>經濟保安處與其他經濟機關之職權，應明確規定劃分，以免重複，使人民有所適從。</p>
<p>提高經濟警察待遇，使能安心服務，負起經濟保安之使命。</p>
<p>戰時頒佈的經濟方面單行法規很多，非一般人所可全部瞭解，明知故犯者固然不可恕，而不知誤犯者其情尙可原，所以，如何使市民尤其工商界澈底瞭解一切經濟法令的意義，希望當局加以注意，作成簡明的詮釋。過去因爲法規的繁瑣，機構的重疊，而使工商感覺麻煩者，應如何調整，也希望當局注意。</p>
<p>可是，就經濟界本身立塲，也應當切實的反省。我們認爲上海經濟界的局部，存在着最可怕的一種現象，就是暴利主義的抬頭。我們曾經說過，暴利主義者與貪污者同樣的可怕，同樣的不名譽。暴利主義者抬頭以後，上海社會形成幾種畸形狀態：</p>
<p>第一；僥倖性，投機性，冒險性的心理，普通孕育，鼓勵盛行。</p>
<p>第二，上面三種心理普遍盛行以後，不再願意循規蹈矩的做正當經營，不再願意安分守己的謀合法利潤，只想走捷徑，圖暴利。</p>
<p>第三，財富集中少數人手中，而大多數人苦於生活鞭策，形成貧富懸殊的特徵。薪水階級挨飢忍餓，而暴利富豪盡情享受，不正當娛樂特別興盛。</p>
<p>老實說，七年以來，生活艱苦者唯有薪水階層，工商界中一部分之暴利主義者財產比七年前豐盈，生活比七年前奢華，心理更比七年前腐化，於是社會現象比七年前畸形了。所以，我們可以斷言，貪污盛行，促使政治腐化；暴利抬頭，促使社會畸形。而貪污政治，是予共產主義以蔓延的機會；社會畸形，也是予共產主義以蔓延的機會。換句話說，貪污政治與社會畸形都是促成共產主義蔓延的動力。</p>
<p>當此戰時，有兩大敵人，其一是暴利主義，其二是共產主義，而暴利主義足以助長共產主義，這兩種毒素的蔓延，都是妨碍戰事的大敵。所以，一方面要全力消滅共產主義的蔓延。一方面更須消滅暴利主義的抬頭。</p>
<p>我們希望經濟保安處當局把握這一前提，對於正當工商界盡力保護，使上海經濟界步入正軌，進一步配合戰時需要。同時，希望當局以最嚴厲最有效的手段，制裁暴利主義！消滅暴利主義！</p>
<h3>汽車公路建設權　移讓各地方長官　日內省加強戰時運輸事務</h3>
<p>東京二十九日中央社電　日內務省爲加強並擴充戰時運輸事務，前曾樹立陸運非常體制及決定高速度汽車專用公路建設方針，其後於去年度曾依照第一次計劃，完成名古屋·大阪·神戶間之公路（闊四米全長一百六十公里），本年度復依照第二期計劃，着手建設名古屋·東京間及神戶·福岡間之公路。茲日內務省並決定，由六月一日起將公路建設權移交各地方長官，以期促進陸上運輸公路建設。茍東京·福岡間之汽車專用公路完成之時，則當可與鐵路運輸，同時推進運輸任務，而置戰時下日本重要都市之運輸連絡於磐石之安，其實現亦極堪期待。</p>
<h3>日大本營發表　洛陽攻略戰果　日軍作戰力量驚人</h3>
<p>洛陽二十九日中央社電　日大本營曾於二十七日發表關於洛陽攻略戰果，其後之戰果逐日擴大，至二十八日止，判明日軍所獲戰果，計渝軍棄屍四千八百二十九具，被俘八千二百八十六人，鹵獲火砲七十六門（野砲四，山砲五，平射砲二十，點五糎榴彈砲二，速射砲六，迫擊砲五十五，）重機槍一八一，步槍六〇〇四，擲彈筒二〇一，同動步槍十，手槍三十五，彈藥無算，其他如電話三十一，無綫電機五，交換機五，火車頭一，貨車四，鐵軌二百條。渝軍棄屍與被俘者合計有一萬三千一百十五人，按防衛洛陽之渝軍三師，稱爲一萬四千人，當已被日軍殲滅，由此可知日軍攻略洛陽所獲戰果之輝皇矣。</p>
<p>洛陽廿九日中央社電　關於此次據守洛陽之渝軍，所以能如此頑強抵抗之原因，固然因具有優秀之裝備，然最主要者，乃因有極堅固之陣地所致。按洛陽之防衛，乃係傾渝軍之全力全能，而完成之最完善最堅固之防衛戰地。洛陽城南一公里，有洛河，其東方更有天險可守，並包含有北方高地及西方平地，渝軍於此，曾全部修成恒久陣地，於城內到處築有掩體砲座，機槍座，交通壕，戰車壕，及大小無數之堡壘等。戰車壕寬十米，深五米，皆掘成十字型，或蜘蛛網型，以備一處雖被突破，他處尙可保全之用。戰車壕最大者寬十米，深達二十米，並注水於北方及西方長達五十公里至六十公里，戰車壕之下部，鎜成交通壕，於城內並有交通遮斷壕，堡壘防空壕。並利用所有住宅牆壁，鎜成槍眼。防空壕深約廿米，於其中可繼續保持作戰能力至十日之久。於本年二月間，來此視察之美人一行，曾對此大爲稱讚。又白馬坡等地具有無數砲座，及可收容數百人大堡壘，西方於新市街之一角，設有各種軍事設施，南方有河防戰地，東方有天險可資利用。又野外陣地，係於城壁附近修成立體形，故稱之爲難攻不落之堅固陣地，實不爲過。但終不能阻止日軍之進攻，諺云：「能制西馬坡，便可下洛陽，」但經佔領北方高地之日軍部隊之總攻擊，終將之一舉攻下，突破如此堅固戰地之日軍，其敢鬬精神，實足驚人也。</p>
<p>洛陽市容一新</p>
<p>洛陽廿九日中央社電　洛陽陷落後之第二日（廿六日），治安維持會即行成立，代理會長爲秦佩卿，一般市民於秦氏指揮下，從事淸掃整理及架橋等工作，廿七日北大街之洛池即已開市，久蒙戰　之日軍勇士，皆欣然而往，出動於市內之宣傳隊，以溫和態度，對市民發放食糧，故市民莫不感　。守備洛陽之渝第十四軍第九十四師，於洛陽陷落前之二三日，曾對其部　頒佈「軍律守條」之六條佈吿。被捕之渝軍士兵中，更有對此示以冷笑者，行將化爲廢墟之洛陽城，由於淸掃工作之修整，其煥然之精神，已跨出向建設新中國途徑邁進之巨步云。</p>
<p>第一戰區澈底破壞</p>
<p>中央社訊　渝第一戰區之抗戰組織，由於此次河南之役，已被徹底破壞，當此時號稱四十萬衆之胡宗南所部河防軍，其動靜當可注目。蓋至今日　防軍以陝西之西安爲中心，對中共盤據之延安取包圍形勢，乃週知之事實。由於日軍此次河南作戰，席捲第一戰區，重慶當局乃命令胡宗南遣兵六師約五萬之衆，前赴洛陽方面助援，然受命赴援之胡宗南軍，與蔣鼎文所部，於洛陽之南方，忽爲日軍擊潰，但河防軍之主力，今日依然睥睨中共，似無所動，對於日軍則未採取何種防衛措置。此種事實，即切實表示渝共磨擦情形至如何程度矣。現在舉行之渝共會，談中解除河防軍對中共軍之包圍態勢，必爲中共所提重要要求之一，此問題若終不能解決，則中共亦必充耳不聞渝方之要求，自在吾人意料之中。但由重慶之立塲言，若解除對中共之包圍態勢，在事實上等於承認中共之自由發展，再者重慶爲避免自身之損失，利用中共軍爲其防戰，故渝共雙方對此問題之解決，必將堅持各自之立塲，直至最後云。</p>
<p>渝軍長李家鈺陣亡</p>
<p>開封二十九日中央社電　渝第卅六集團軍司令部，廿一日於大營因我部隊之猛烈攻擊，致受徹底之打擊，於該戰鬬中，傳稱該集團軍軍長生死不明，其後確證其已戰死。其他參謀處副官處多數戰死或被俘，故其首腦部已吿崩潰。按李家鈺係四川省人，一八八九年生，四川軍官學校畢業，曾任第一百師師長，兼第四十七軍軍長。去年以來，於隴海綫沿綫新安方面，努力增強戰力。</p>
<p>北平二十九日中央社電　日軍部隊二十一日下午三時半，攻擊大營（陝州西方）南方四公里附近之渝軍千餘，日軍以手榴彈突入渝軍陣地，予以重大打擊。是役渝軍遺屍百五十具（內有將校多名），俘虜六十名，該渝軍係自新安敗潰而來者，原爲李家鈺所屬，頃已判明其爲第三十六集團，並設有第四十九軍司令部。俘虜中有集團軍副官處長周鼎銘少將以下校官十數名，周處長因被俘時已受重傷，故不久即逝世，日軍並將其安葬。關於該集團軍長及參謀長，業已逃脫，但傳聞曾發現似爲要人之屍體三具，故彼等或係戰死，亦未可知。又據俘虜言，第百四師長某業已戰死。</p>
<h3>褚外長因要公　昨晨抵東京</h3>
<p>東京二十九日中央社電　國民政府外交部長褚民誼氏，因要公來日，二十九日晨抵東京，下午六時與駐日大使蔡培氏聯名宴請日本東條首相·重光外相·靑木大東亞相·石渡藏相·島田海相等各大臣，三十日下午決更聯名宴請日本元帥府杉山元帥·永野元帥·岡部文相·松平宮相等。</p>
<p>渝第一戰區崩潰後國府建設力量增強</p>
<p>鄭州二十九日中央社電　自英美方面觀之，重慶乃對日反攻之前進據點，故對之抱有莫大期待，但河南方面渝第一戰區自洛陽陷落後，即臨崩潰之勢。此次河南會戰，於軍事上不止潰滅其第一戰區三十萬衆之軍旅，且華北與武漢方面之聯繋，及隴海綫大半之確保，使日軍進攻重慶之主導權，確固不動。按河南平原乃渝方抗戰經濟上之西北有力基地，但今已轉爲國府發展勢力之地盤，故此對國府實加強莫大之實力，此次會戰後，已有河南農產物輸入和平地區，如天津·北平·市塲之食糧價格，傳較開戰前低落二成，對於黃河治水計劃事，露出根本解決之曙光，故此次河南會戰，對國府之建設有甚大力量。</p>
<h3>鄭州方面　日趨繁榮</h3>
<p>鄭州二十八日中央社電　因渝方抗戰理論錯誤，致豫省農民紛被強制，徵募驅往前綫從軍。自從此次日軍之河南作戰吿一段落後，彼等業已陸續歸來，例如鄭州於日軍入城後之第八日，已成立治安維持會及商會，至警察局及各區公署等，亦已開始辦公。過去之四萬人口業有二萬歸來，故市面已日趨繁榮。目前該地特有之現象，即日語學校已先後成立，同時影院戲館等娛樂塲所亦開始營業，又發電所於事變駻，即被日機炸毀，發電設備則於去夏被渝省府拍賣，至今亦無街燈設備。頃當局已於數處設置電燈，平漢隴海鐵路沿綫之電燈，預定不久即行裝置。</p>
<h3>佐佐木博士　談講學感想</h3>
<p>日本農業家佐佐木博士，應本報新聞報學術講座之聘，日前赴京講演，大陸新報記者訪問，博士談述觀感謂：「雖稱學術講座，但對方非專門家，故避免深入。所演講者，主要爲中國農業之基礎的重要性，從農業觀點上中日提携之必然性等。在上海之講題爲「從農業上所見之日本，中國及英美」。在南京，預定將以余所專門之畜產爲重心，演講「從東亞畜產上所見中國之畜產及其資源」。余曾出席在英美舉行之學會，關於各國農業，亦曾調查，得以列舉具體數字比較論證各國農業。說明中日在農業上之共同性極大，使學生得以明瞭。中日爲不可分者，並將強調日本農業冠絕世界，製造年產牛乳百〇二石之霍斯坦因種乳牛，及年產卵三百六十四個之白色萊格亨雞種，此種技術，當然應介紹至中國。移入英美技術，在中國實有害無益。在南京除講演及座談外，並擬實地視察各農塲及中國農業云。</p>
<h3>印兵覺悟　參加國民軍</h3>
<p>仰光二十九日中央社電　哥希馬附近之敵，目下爲打開哥希馬至伊姆法爾之公路自迪馬普爾方面增遣英兵，但英兵之動員數目已達限度，故最近之後方服務者，盡力起用老年兵，同時對指揮下之印度兵監視與督戰愈嚴厲，藉圖堅定對日抗戰意志。二十二日哥希馬西側四六〇高地遭日軍肉搏攻擊，自敵裝甲車逃出投降日軍之印度塞克兵克森基也新，頃就英人對印度兵之慘暴行爲聲述如次：英國人對吾印人之殘暴，其行爲無異於飲吾人之血，食吾人之肉，英國兵對吾等之欺瞞方策，吾等今已全部明瞭，參加國民軍之聲浪，日益高掦。第一綫印度兵之北後，無論何時，均架設機關槍，尤於夜間英人對印度兵之監視與督戰更爲嚴厲，如稍有後退之意，必即刻遭射殺，印兵對此種行爲，因過分恐懼，已喪失戰意。吾人稱督戰者爲「地獄之嚮導」，故參加國民軍者與日俱增，吾人之裝甲車部隊，於進擊之際，後方必有英人監視，或在吾人後方開槍督戰，今後吾人誓　報此仇，從速覺悟，參加國民軍。</p>
<h3>美飛機　襲南營受挫</h3>
<p>新鄉二十九日中央社電　駐渝美軍爲阻止日軍急速進攻，曾行執拗來襲，十二日曾有渝機二十八架來襲南營（洛陽西方二十公里）附近日軍當以防空砲火與之　戰，予以重創後，將之擊退。敵機（F40)型機一架，因機體障礙，被迫降落，美軍一駕駛員被俘。據該俘虜供稱：最初以爲該地日軍部隊無高射砲而可安心轟炸，孰料完全判斷錯誤，日軍旺盛之作戰精神，於今思之，實深戰慄。吾等乃以空襲日本本土爲目的而來中國大陸，今與日軍接觸後，已感失望云。</p>
<h3>獲得南方資源後　日煤油事業改觀</h3>
<p>東京二十九日中央社電　戰前日本之煤油狀態，與德國殆全相同，國內資源旣屬缺乏，即人造石油亦不能充分發達，就人造煤油而言，其狀態更遜於德國。按昭和十一年度（民國二十五年度）日本國內石油生產額約爲四十萬噸，此數僅爲全部需要之百分之八，賴他地輸入量實達五百萬噸，然自獲得南方石油資源後，日本煤油事業已大爲改觀，戰前南方各地煤油之生產量，爲蘇門答臘約五百二十萬噸，婆羅洲爲一百八十萬噸。爪哇爲八十四萬噸，錫蘭爲十萬噸，緬甸爲一百十萬噸，但現在各地生產額已爲戰前之數倍，然處此戰時下，並不能因南方油源之確保，而即認爲滿足。日政府爲一元統制國內·國外採油事業，，前曾飭令帝國煤油公司進行開發事宜，其在精油部門方面，亦曾於前年創設煤油精煉業協議會，以謀經營煤油事業之一元化。今與反軸心方面之煤油事業相較，日方之利點在於推進內綫作戰，反軸心方面煤油生產量雖多，但彼等欲求以煤油輸往必要之戰域，必經過遼長之運輸路，例如彼等將煤油由加利福尼亞州運至西太平洋戰塲所羅門，其相距之路程爲六千哩以上。反之，日方所具有之利點，則因當地精油事業之發達，可將煤油從油田迅速輸往戰塲，至於資產絕對量，雖較敵方爲劣，但從另一方面以視，日方旣可充分確保煤油之必要量，同時更可迅速成爲戰力化，在此點上，其利點實數倍於敵人也。</p>

<p>南京廿九日中央社電中央憲兵第一團組織巡查隊，流動查巡各處，以防奸宄義勸，規定各旅店旅客之申報及注意監視事項，如申報不實，將予嚴懲。</p>
<h3>中華蠶絲公司　招待各長官</h3>
<p>南京二十九日中央社電中華蠶絲股份有限公司，係繼前華中蠶絲公司之解散後而新發足者，繼續經營國府治下之蠶絲事業。該公司於中日經濟合作之原則下，由中日合，由中日雙方各半負担。自經積極籌備以來，已於本月三日正式在滬成立，今後我國蠶絲事來前途，將因該公司之新發足，而定有良好之進展，是可預卜。該公司董事長許遜公，副董事長長岡哲三兩氏，為與國府有關各長官，曁目都實業界巨子，請示經營方針，及聯絡惑情起見，特於日前聯袂由濕普京，連日拜訪中日朝野人士，頗形忙錄。二十九日下午七時，並在龍門酒家舉行盛大招待宴，到有國府司法院長溫宗堯，副院長朱履和，考試院院長江亢虎，副院長繆斌，立法院副院長諸靑來，實業部長陳君　，實傳部次長郭秀峯，暨盟邦軍政長官，駐京產來徑濟界人士等數十人，濟濟一堂，情緒融洽。席間該公司董事長許遜公起立致詞歡迎，要求各界對該公司加以協力，使完成任務。</p>

<h3>維拉特里前綫　攻防戰熾烈　德宣佈退出亞普里亞</h3>
<p>沮利克二十九日中央社電此間接訊：義戰綫之反軸心軍，自齊斯迭那至維拉特里。伏爾蒙頓（Valmontone）棧企岡突擊該戰綫，使德方亦確認該方面事態重大。現激戰中心在維拉特里之前方陣地。該地德軍以維拉特里為界之前衛基地，建築極為堅强，且反軸心軍若擊破維拉特里而進攻伏爾蒙頓時，該方面之懲軍實有將敵包圍之可能。又據中立國人士觀測，凱賽林元帥為堅守維拉特里，將目他方面戰棧抽調一部份兵力，增强該地防務。</p>
<p>柏林二十九日中央社電德國新聞社引德官方戰報稱：日昨義境德軍之防禦戰甚為得手，亞普里亞——伏爾蒙頓數區中，敵于激戰時企圖突破德陣被擊退。曾被德軍殿後部隊堅守之亞普里亞城之險墟，已被德軍放棄。蘭魯維奧之東，德特別機械化部隊即刻反攻，將陣線拉直。伏爾蒙頓之南，數日來敵軍突進點，已被德軍由東方及西北方攻入而縮小。</p>
<p>羅馬居民繼續疏散</p>
<p>羅馬廿九日中央社電海通社訊：昨為聖　降臨頭，此問敎堂　壓與砲聲相應和，但全城居民不赴敎堂參加禮拜者為數甚少。雙方昨繼續發坐自義國開戰以來嚴激烈之戰事，敵方即有所獲，亦得不償失。羅馬居民之疏散，昨仍繼續進行，有留城必耍之居民則予撇退者以種種協助，外國新聞記者十餘人與少數外交官尙留在羅馬，渠等非至必要時决不撤這。</p>
<p>義北古城再遭空襲</p>
<p>羅馬二十九日中央社電海通社訊：反軸心飛機於週六再襲佛洛倫斯，文化古蹟亦遭猛炸。</p>

<h3>德國中部上空　發生劇烈空戰　美機七十三架被擊落</h3>
<p>柏林二十九日中央社電德國新聞社訊：昨午反軸心機空襲德境薩克森尼區，（Soxony）發生劇烈空戰，敵機被擊落至少五十架，內四引擊轟炸機三十八架，敵方大批長程戰鬥機仍不能阻止德戰鬥機及驅逐機之襲擊。又據海通社：美機分批來襲，中間約距離四十分鐘之久，初佯作襲擊柏林狀，但在將抵柏林時，即折向東南，終在薩克森尼區投彈，德防空部隊並未中敵人之奸計，故在馬格特堡（Mogdeburg）與薩克森尼區上空，均展開猛烈空戰。</p>
<p>柏林二十九日中央社電德國新聞社訊：日昨美機襲德中部時，被擊落七十三架。</p>
<h3>盟邦日本海軍紀念節特輯之十　日本海軍人員的　偉大精神</h3>
<p>武器與軍艦的能否發揮其力量，全賴處理的人以為斷斷。日本海軍的軍艦，是全世界最新銳的，無論在艦型，速力，裝甲，兵士配置上，各國均望塵莫及，且其武器，飛機，火藥，如在大東亞戰爭中所證明者，有着無比的精度與性能。然而讓如美國般的海軍兵員處理起來，終不能充分發揮其力量。這裏，我們在兵員上，見到了日本海軍所以為全世界最强的理由</p>
<p>日本海軍人員在訓練中，將每週的日曜都改變過來，里期休假，星期六休假半天是絕對沒有的。他們每週的日　是月月火水木金金。</p>
<p>試舉培育一個少年飛行兵的例子來看：他們入隊以後，三年之間，他們體。縱在羣上飛行，在一，以至於自己的飛機經過地球上的何處。不如此，怎能冒着密雲，轟炸珍珠　與達爾文。至第四年始學習航空技術，第五年學習射繫與轟炸。第六年，習射繫與轟炸。第六年，乘航空母艦實習，至第七年，始能獨自駕駛飛機。其精神，其按術，缺一不能焉　國家的飛機。</p>
<p>水雷，砲　亦然。東鄭元帥曾說：「一致必中的砲一門，相等於　發一中的砲百門。」在歷次海戰中，均證明日本每個人所主持的砲，有着英美砲員所主持的百門以上的砲</p>
<p>潛水艦的船員，為不多都是下士官。潛水艦必須優秀的兵員。加入海兵團的志願兵，先在六個月的海兵團坐活中受初步訓練，然後乘德習雖愛適當檢查，分別為砲員，水雷員，機城員等，在砲術學校，永雷學校，工機學校等受各種專門叫育之後，在軍艦上實習，再入學校學習高等科的技術，不斷的加以鍛鍊。乘潛水艦的人，更須另入潛水學校。</p>
<p>指揮這些優秀兵員的指揮官，如兵科的士官，則卒業於江田島的海軍兵學校，機械科的卒業於舞　的海軍機械學校，軍醫與藥劑科的士官卒業於東京海軍軍醫學校，主計科的士官則卒業於東京的海軍經理學校。</p>
<p>試看江田島海軍兵學校的生活。該校收容修畢中學四年以上的學生，低級生絕對服從高級生。上下運然一體，養成日本海軍傳統情神「不恃敵人之不來，而恃我之看備」的自信力。無論何時，茍有敵人前來，必擊破之。這種自信，比兵器的優秀，軍艦數量的多寡都還重要</p>
<p>「樂於就死」，乃非日本人不備的崇高的犧牲精神。「敵倒之前，不死」的話，是更積極的莊嚴的攻繫精神。這攻擊精神，實是盡忠報國的至誠之顯現。有此至誠，乃能成就歷次海戰中的偉次戰果。</p>
<h3>日俄戰爭的教訓</h3>
<p>— 宮慶治</p>
<p>一方面產生勃茲希內爾的美國，却在實際戰爭中向世界證明了潛水艇的威力。</p>
<p>此後便有各種形式的「潛水艇」出現，其間有　國硬式飛船發明家賽普伊，萊姆所造的「普洛德克泰」，以及愛爾蘭人霍蘭所造的「霍蘭」。前者不論在水上水中，皆用三十匹馬力的汽油發動機，可出水上八節半水中五節半的速力，並有四個可以收人艇內的車輪，能在海底行駛。日俄戰爭時。俄國購貿此艇，泊於海參崴，以狙日本艦隊。</p>
<p>日本購入霍　式潛水艇以後，即開始研究，已如前述。有名的佐久間大尉在山口縣新凑洋面潛水第六號潛水艇雖說是霍　式，却是和第七號潛水艇一同在日本川崎造船廠造的。至其範本，則為明治三十七年（一九〇四年）十一月從美國電船公司請人的第五號潛水艇。佐久間大尉早難的原因，在於實驗此種祇重七十五噸的小艇能够潛航多久。富時，電動機很小，到底不能長久在水中潛航。如用水上用的汽油機關在水中行駛，固然可以潛航到很遠，但無方法捨棄此時所發生的有毒氣體。在無可奈何中，遂想出將艇半沉半浮，由上甲板上的通風筒灈入海上的新鮮空氣，以供汽油發動機用的方法。這便是所謂半潛航。</p>
<p>第六號艇就在此種半潛航的寳騐中因激浪打入通風一筒而沈沒的。</p>
<h3>日本建艦技術的進步</h3>
<p>其間日本海軍造了一些怎樣的軍艦呢？「筑波」「生駒」雖為巡洋戰艦的濫觴，但日本看到英國造出「無敵」級的軍艦以後，也進而設計建造更强有力的軍艦。</p>
<p>然此處必須攷慮的是：日本有否建造這種巨艦的能力。不逾擬成如何的造艦計劃，茍無相應的技術，終造不成軍艦。所以在明治四十四年（一九一一年）草成這個造艦計斷力時，一般皆以為是不自的妄想。結果議會也提量出「日本能造如此巨艦嗎」等等關於造艦技術的問題。當時，海軍大臣齋藤實中將在議會中作下列的答辯道。</p>
<p>「日本決定將來日本的軍艦全部在日本內地由日本人之手建造。惟這此建艦計劉的第一艦「金剛」號，在以其為技術藍本的意味上，使在英國造之。今後日本帝國海軍的軍艦絕對不在外國建造。」</p>
<p>這個答辯不但使日本人吃驚，速西洋人也為之失色。據　藤氏的「回想記」，在議會作此答辯後，海軍省內亦因而大嘩云。</p>
<p>雖說日本今後的軍艦將全部在國內建造，但造「河內」「攝津」等軍艦已不容易，而將來須造如何龐大的軍艦，更是無從預測。那怎麼造呢？然而負責的大臣竟在議會上明白宣布，這不是太輕率了嗎？可是，因為不能就不迭，那末技術的進步決無希望。倘若一味模仿他國，或向他國購買，則國家也和個人一樣，決難强盛起來。必須要無中生有，刻苦淬　才行。日本人因在任何事情上皆有不敗的信念，所以祇有「金剛」號是在英國維卡斯廠定造的，而其姊妹艦「比　」「榛名」「霧島」三艘則全在國內造成。</p>
<p>不但在此三艦於日本國內竣工時，即在發表其計畫時，亦使全世界的海軍專家吃驚不小。</p>
<p>迄至那時為止，世界上最大的大砲是英國超D級戰艦的十三吋半砲，但日本的金剛級戰艦却備十四吋砲八門。軍艦上俱能搭藝這樣大的砲嗎？當日本向英國定造「金剛從號時，英國技術家立即研究其設計，可驚的是這個設計遠勝自信為世界造船界權威的他們所有的設計，賣近於完美之境。</p>
<p>當時他們正計畫建造比「雄獅」號大的二萬八千五百噸大巡洋戰艦「猛虎」號，「金剛」號的排水量為二萬九千三百三十噸，比「猛虎」號稍大，但却强得多，因此他們中止原來計畫，幾乎全熊「金剛」號的設計改造，惟所裝大砲仍為十三吋半八</p>
<p>金剛級的巡洋戰艦是當時世界最大最强的軍艦，其速力亦達二十七節半，與他國戰艦比較，毫無遜色。除出「金剛」號以外，其姊妹艦全部在日本的造船廠造成。</p>
<p>「金剛」是搭載十四吋砲的世界最初出現的巡洋檻。至於戰艦，自大正四年到七年（一九一五，一八年），日本所造的超D級戰艦「扶桑」，及其姊妹艦「山城」「日向」「伊勢」三艦，皆慶三萬噸的巨艦，各備十四吋砲十之門，為世界最强的戰艦，相繼就役後，殊為世人注目。這些戰艦和金剛級巡洋戰艦四艘構成了最合理想的四四艦隊。這支艦隊的整備，乃使日本海軍為全世界各海軍國中的第一流海軍。（完）（吉：摘譯「軍艦史話」之一章）</p>

<h3>對於經濟保安處之設置　經濟界座談意見</h3>
<p>自從本市第一警察局設置經濟保安處以後，以其與經濟界有密切之關係，工商人士對之表示非常關心。本報爰經邀請經濟界領袖舉行座談會，對於經濟保安處應有的期待，交換意見，足以代表一般經濟界人士之觀感。茲特　理發表於次：</p>
<p>項康原先生　　經濟保安處之成立，與工商界最有密切關係。茲提出希望數點：　經濟保安處行政設施所依據之各種法令，違禁罰則及檢查手續等，應儘早公布，使人民有所遵守。　人民達犯法令，其違禁判罰如由保安處執行者，應有保護委員會之設，以資愼重。同時，罰則似宜定一最高限度，如犯罪情節超過此限度者，　則移　以院依法審理。　經濟警察於　行　務時，須有　別　記，以免發生假　情事。同時，經濟警察之設施，必須適合上海經濟界的環境。　經濟警察之待遇，希望特別提高，使其能維持生活，安心服務。</p>
<p>李權時先生：</p>
<p>現在經濟保安處的設立，是為了謀上海市民的福利，所以經濟警察，必須特別得力，且個個必須品格高尚，否則，非但不足以女定經濟，或反足以擾亂商民　　原來要統制經濟成功，必須執行統制者必先能統制自己的慾念，如經濟警察不能檢察自已，則不能　制他人，此非言之過苛，乃期望過殷，故言之也切。</p>
<p>經濟警襲之使命，在乎經濟保安。所謂「經濟保安」乃保獲民生和經濟之安定，欲求民生之獲得保障，必須抑减百物之零售價格，但亦須權衛輕重，分別執行，如蔬菜·米·煤·鹽等，均與民生有非常密切關係，希望經濟保安處能加以注意，抑低其價格，尤其是小菜塲的菜蔬價格。</p>
<p>從前淸鄕的敎訓，是衆所週知的事實，希望經濟保安處開始即能樹立信譽，不蹈過去淸鄉工作多多貽人以口實之蒞轍。</p>
<p>多一個機關，能够有利於人民，當然最好。否則，如果　不好，則不如不辦的好，今後備　經濟保安處能鐵而無　，做到價正為人民謀福利的目的。</p>
<p>孫瑞璜先生：</p>
<p>經濟保安處是第一警察局中暫設立的機關，　先應使外界了解其　命，以　將來知法犯法，現尚來　　切的說明，故近來外　如　疑惑。　　　　　　　的工作、人權偵察　　　違法方為　　　，　的似在　　　　　　主要商品　　　　　　　　，但　　　　　？　者為非法？應使一般人民確切關瞭，如品名質量及數目等，應詳細規定及說明·若知法知法，理應照罰；若不知而罰，似非當局之本意。故經濟保安處如能在實行工作之前，對人民詳細說明，則可免掉許多寃枉及無謂的糾紛，我想此乃人民所希望的。</p>
<p>林康侯先生：</p>
<p>經濟保安處為特高處經濟科之擴大，成立以後，僅見渡副局長與五島處長之談話，但我們希望陳市長亦能發表意見，上海管理經濟的機關有市府經濟局，物資調查委員會，經濟處和經濟保安處等四機關。我的意見，要求當局明白披露此四機關之各個職權和界限，使民間可以瞭解。保安處與淸　局不同，希望絲毫不致擾及人民。按過去淸　區內的搜查辦法，已使人民呌苦連天，何能再用於上海，保安警察應出以文明手段，凡有任何違法事件，最好先與問業公會商量，協力　濟弊端，公會以職責所在，决不會存心祖護的。</p>
<p>我們現在所要求當局的是：　對四機關的職權和界限，明確發表。　　淸保安處興淸鄉局世　不同，應採取和平手段，此兩點做到以後，方可談到其他問題　　蔡聲白先生：　　剛才聽見諸位高見甚為　同　　補充意見數點如次：</p>
<p>經濟保安處的法令範圍，必須有明確之規定，目前團家戰時經濟法令公佈甚多，但意義深奧，非一般人民所能了解。故希望當局根據法令，編訂詳盡的釋文，使人民有所遵循，同時也不致發生曲解。這種意義便是使人民「先敎而後誅，勿為不敎而誅。</p>
<p>對於違犯法令者，宜加以適當之處置。犯法商店情節如不重大，應先通知同業公會，加以勸吿，使其改遇自新。因為法律不外乎人情，犯法者倘能及時改過，　為省事。至於將來犯法者，是否由經濟保安處單獨判决，抑犯法者可以延律師辯護，亦必須明文規定。最好經濟保安處負偵查之職，而由法院負判決之職　　　經濟調查工作，須力求單純化。目下中央及地方所設機關甚多，如金融檢查處，保險監理局，及即將成立的企業監會局，工商管理委員會等。機構旣多，職權預複。中央為上級　關，經濟保安處為下屬機關，保安處的調查工作，凡中央政府設有專門的調查機關，就不必再由經濟保安處重加調查，以免重核。</p>
<p>陳日平先生：</p>
<p>經濟保安處之成立、工商界及一般市民非常關心，本人對於此事希望於政府當局及各界者略述如下：</p>
<p>對於政府方面之希望：</p>
<p>（甲）綁濟法令之統一明定：現行經濟法令隨時訂定施行，重複紛歧，似欠明晣之處甚多，實有統一　訂之必要，希望中央或地方政府　訂統一經濟法令，將應受統制各事須明確規定，詳為釋示，使商民易於遵守。</p>
<p>（乙）行政機構事權之集中：本市經濟行政機稱似覺過多，事權未易集中，人民頗感煩擾，大有菒可適從之感。希望政府方而迅予調整，合併重複之經濟行政檢構，以期事權集中，政令易於推行。</p>
<p>（丙）處罰公允：罰則明定，審理周詳，以免枉縱，或則罪情輕者予以行政處分，重者移送司法機關處理，而期公允。　　　對於經濟保安處之希望：</p>
<p>（甲）提高經濟警察之待遇，並保障其職位：經濟保安處警察，因職務關係，與外界接觸較繁，易受違法者之利誘。提高待遇必須使其足够維持生活，則內　無憂，更須保障其職位，俾可安心服務，以增强行政之效能。</p>
<p>（乙）賞罰嚴明：經濟警察之待遇提高，職位保障，猶未足以言至善。必須視其是否　職，以定賞罰。具有功績者，應予獎賞；枉法自私者，依法嚴辦。設能賞罰嚴明，庶足鼓勵其服務精神。</p>
<p>（丙）愼選人才：經濟警察之待遇旣優，應愼選品學優良者充任，以期廉明公正，動護奉公，並能善導商民，共同守法。　　　對於市民方面之希望：</p>
<p>（甲）市民奉行政府戰時經濟政策：當茲參戰時期，政府實施職時統制經濟政策，無綸工商各界，自應協力推行，以防物資之缺乏，物價之暴漲，危害民生，影響戰事。如商民各自檢肅，當無違犯經濟法令情事，而免受　處　　（乙）各有關團體及言論機關，指導市民守法：市商會，各同業公會，保甲自警團，及有關市民福利各團體，對於商民時加指導勸告，切勿居奇，非法謀利，有違經濟法令情事，亦為防範未然之最好方法。</p>
<p>（丙）共同協力消弭非法行為：經濟警察行使職權，固為取締居奇暴利之對策，然以本市人烟之稠密，地域之遼闊，各方如能共同協力，隨時檢舉，實為消弭非法行為之良好方法。不獨連犯經濟法令情事可以防範，即其他非法情事，亦可减少。</p>
<p>姚慶三先生</p>
<p>諸位高見甚多，本人略加補充。我以為經濟保安處，關係全市民生極大，其一舉一勸，應有法令根據，同時又須與事實符合。</p>
<p>所謂法令根據者，政府前所頒布之囤積主要物安治罪條例，當為該處今後調查物資之一般的根據，但其條文太簡單，在施行時，必須有補充細則，此點希望政府明確規定，俾使違法者，明白其所犯為何條何款，知所屬成。</p>
<p>所謂與事實符合者，必須　到事實的各方面，譬如規定限價，　與貨物的成本適合，若限價不適合成本，則商人必感困苦。又如黃金買賣一事，法令上從未明令禁止，而事實上政府且以黃金收買棉紗布，彼買賣黃金者，其金條即由出售棉紗布而得，究竟是否有罪，以及如何可以無罪，政府亦應明白解釋。</p>
<p>再者，明定經濟保安處職權範範，乃必逢之舉，我以為凡中央在上海對於某種事業，已直接設有管理機關者，不應再受經濟保安處的干涉。目下中央對於銀錢業方面，已設有金融檢查處，對於保險業方面，已設有保險監理局，對於各企業公司，亦將設立企業監督局，凡中央所已辦者，就不必再由地方重辦，以免職權重複。　　要而言之，經濟保安處的工作乃為消極的，只能懲戒於犯法之後，若欲防患於未然，必須從事積極的工作，即安定民生，民生安定之後，經濟犯罪行為就可减少。</p>

<p>嘉路畔之吳江縣屬為產米之鄉，故釀酒事業向極發達，僅次於蘇州。去年因糯米絲制限制釀造，故由江蘇省糧管局通令各釀造商須先申請，由其核准方可　造。各商因事關糧政，無不照辦。後由糧管局分別　定釀造量，約照前年釀造數核減百分之四十在案，當時米統會並無艦動，亦無規例頒布。不意本年三月新酒即將登塲之際，吳江米統會辦事處忽行文通知蘇吳區釀造業同業公會，略謂：</p>
<p>查明蘇吳區釀造業公會所呈釀造數址，核與江蘇省糧食局戰定數量，尙屬相符，理合呈復鑒核等情。查吳江釀造商逕行直接採購糯米，依法應照定私囤積意處，姑念無知，應將已購釀酒之米，按本會收配辦法，補具手續，即本會收價每石八百二十元，配價一千八百元，相差每石九百八十元，速着該公會轉飭各商按船三萬三千九百九十六石實釀數量計算，從速將差金掃數送會為要，等因奉此，查各商未經本會核准，擅自直接採運糯米，破壞法規，弁髦公令，殊屬非是，所有差額，務希督飭各商迅於照數　解，俾轉呈結束，幸勿延誤，即希查照辦理為荷。</p>
<p>查各商釀造已奉糧管局之批准，有何不合，米統會事前對於糯米旣無全盤收買之計劃，事後對於釀商又無粒米配給之事，實欲藉一紙公文，襲括所謂差金達三千一百三十二萬六千零八十元之組，不勞而獲，天下甯有是理。聞各商正擬會同向上級機關請求澈查中。且蘇州吳江同一公會，購米釀酒情彩，究全相同。米統會不提蘇州，單指吳江，則以蘇州乃省會之區，不敢輕舉妄動，懼人指摘，吳江乃鄉僻之區，米統會雖非官應衙門，然嚇嚇鄉下人固綽綽然有餘。際此后胡甫經處刑而身負國家糧政重任之米統會辦事人，竟敢步其後　，以身試法，在彼固屬要錢不耍命，然而鄉下人則有命錢兩無之苦矣。</p>

<h3>海軍</h3>
<p>— 岩田雄　洪洋</p>
<p>給妹妹的信（六）</p>
<p>這個絕念碑，和二中校內的中原鐵心　碑比較，卻有那十價大。在背面，　刻着英文的碑文。　失　了一半，就覺得非常不高具。</p>
<p>（明治時代的日本人，一定不是誠心悅服地感謝白　利的，一定另外有非如此表示謝意不可的苦衷。）</p>
<p>只有這樣的解釋。</p>
<p>老板娘所說的全景畫，是在碑圓的外面。很簡陋的小　裹，陳列着幼稚而拙笨的輸船據隊畫，當時的略圖，以及白魯利的照片等。自魯利的面孔上並無　髪，看着很年靑，戴着一隻眼的眼鏡。看着總好像　　擠眼弄鼻，有寬的顴骨今日美國大總統羅斯福。</p>
<p>（是想　擊日本的美國人之眼睛！）想到這個地方的時候，覺得好笑起來。　夫又向砂灘方面走去。走疲倦了，就在柔軟的砂子上面坐下。</p>
<p>上午辰光的海面，起伏着小小的波紋。在激中，像有銀色的魚羣在跳躍着一樣，日光在反射着，在彼岸，有很多的山，綿延不斷。（海是如何美妙呀！）蓬賞海面，這是很久未能的事了。昨夜睡眠不足的事，似乎也忘記了，實在覺着心曠神怡。</p>
<p>（前面呈現出非常高大的山。雖然不比大隅山高，但形狀封有點柱　。）</p>
<p>他並不知進鹿野山和鋸山的名字，但他注意到在海中不斷的山，是向故辦去的。在這個海　上，自然沒有纓島那樣幽雅的媚姿，同時也沒有香味撲鼻的松林，眞倒像遭受過輪船襲擊的樣十。這個海面的碧蓋，和山脈的週綿，是與質人共問遊玩的那個天保山濱，毫無二致。</p>
<p>（海是如何美妙呀！）</p>
<p>他在心中又說了這樣一句。眞人也是喜歡海的。或許隆夫更加喜歡。然而一個却富了海上的健兒，　價却當了苦惱塵世的絕望畫家。前此同樣愛海的兩個人，現在却有了天壤的懸殊。</p>
<p>（海是這樣的美麗！然而我已經成為不能愛海的一個人了。）</p>
<p>隆夫又被昨夜的煩惱，開始襲擊了。就好像非常清楚的腦海，被墨水所染，完全成為黑色了</p>
<p>（到海邊來作什麼？眞不應當來。快回久里濱館去，機續寫完昨天夜裏的未完信吧！然後，在下午就回東京去吧！）</p>
<p>他想到此處就要起身，然而忽然看到了一件東西，就起不來了。</p>

<h3>Eliminating Profiteering</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the First Police Bureau's Economic Security Division in this city, the business community has shown great concern and high expectations for it, owing to its close relationship with the economic sector itself. In order to facilitate communication between the authorities and the business community, our newspaper invited prominent figures to a symposium to discuss the Economic Security Division. The proceedings have now been compiled and are published on page three of today's newspaper. It is believed that the Economic Security Division authorities and members of the business community will be pleased to read it.</p>
<p>Summarizing various opinions, the key points can be outlined as follows:</p>
<p>The Economic Security Division should clearly publicize all laws and regulations so that the people can understand and abide by them.</p>
<p>For minor violations, the Economic Security Division should contact trade associations to advise and give offenders an opportunity to rehabilitate themselves. Serious violations should be referred to the courts.</p>
<p>The powers and duties of the Economic Security Division and other economic agencies should be clearly defined and separated to avoid duplication and confusion for the public.</p>
<p>Raise the salaries of economic police officers to enable them to serve with peace of mind and fulfill their mission of economic security.</p>
<p>Many ad hoc economic laws and regulations have been promulgated during the war, and it is impossible for the average person to fully understand them. While deliberate violations are inexcusable, unintentional violations are somewhat excusable. Therefore, the authorities should pay attention to how to ensure that citizens, especially those in the business community, thoroughly understand the meaning of all economic laws and regulations, and create concise interpretations. How to adjust the past situations where businesses felt troubled by the complexity of regulations and overlapping of agencies is also something the authorities should pay attention to.</p>
<p>However, from the perspective of the economic community itself, there should also be a thorough self-reflection. We believe that a most terrible phenomenon exists in a portion of Shanghai's economic sphere: the rise of profiteering. We have said before that profiteers are as terrible and dishonorable as corrupt officials. Since the rise of profiteering, several abnormal situations have formed in Shanghai society:</p>
<p>First, the mentality of luck, speculation, and risk-taking is commonly nurtured and encouraged.</p>
<p>Second, after the above three mentalities become prevalent, people are no longer willing to do proper business in a law-abiding manner, and they are no longer willing to seek legitimate profits in a peaceful manner, but only want to take shortcuts to seek huge profits.</p>
<p>Third, wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few, while the majority suffer from the hardships of life, forming a stark gap between the rich and the poor. Salaried workers suffer from hunger, while profiteering tycoons enjoy themselves to the fullest, and improper entertainment is particularly prosperous.</p>
<p>To be honest, for the past seven years, only the salaried class has lived a difficult life. The property of some profiteers in the business community is richer than it was seven years ago, their lives are more extravagant than they were seven years ago, and their minds are more corrupt than they were seven years ago. Therefore, social phenomena are more abnormal than they were seven years ago. Therefore, we can assert that rampant corruption promotes political corruption; the rise of profiteering promotes social distortion. And corrupt politics provides an opportunity for the spread of communism; social distortion also provides an opportunity for the spread of communism. In other words, corrupt politics and social distortion are both driving forces behind the spread of communism.</p>
<p>During this time of war, there are two major enemies: one is profiteering, and the other is communism. And profiteering is enough to promote communism. The spread of these two toxins are both major enemies hindering the war effort. Therefore, on the one hand, we must make every effort to eliminate the spread of communism. On the other hand, we must eliminate the rise of profiteering.</p>
<p>We hope that the authorities of the Economic Security Division will grasp this premise, do their best to protect legitimate businesses, and guide Shanghai's economic sphere back on track, and further cooperate with the needs of the war. At the same time, we hope that the authorities will use the most severe and effective means to sanction profiteering! Eliminate profiteering!</p>
<h3>Rights to Build Motor Highways Transferred to Local Governors. Interior Ministry Strengthens Wartime Transportation Affairs</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) - The Interior Ministry, in order to strengthen and expand wartime transportation affairs, previously established an extraordinary land transportation system and decided on a policy for the construction of high-speed motor vehicle-only highways. Subsequently, according to the first plan last year, it completed the highway between Nagoya, Osaka, and Kobe (four meters wide and 160 kilometers long). This year, according to the second phase of the plan, it began construction of highways between Nagoya and Tokyo, and between Kobe and Fukuoka. Now, the Interior Ministry has also decided to transfer the highway construction rights to the local governors from June 1st in order to promote the construction of land transportation highways. If the motor vehicle-only highway between Tokyo and Fukuoka is completed, it will be able to advance the transportation mission simultaneously with railway transportation, placing the transportation connections of important cities in Japan under wartime conditions on a solid foundation. Its realization is greatly anticipated.</p>
<h3>Imperial Japanese Headquarters Announces War Results of Luoyang Capture. The Japanese Army's Combat Power is Astonishing</h3>
<p>Luoyang, 29th (Central News Agency) - The Imperial Japanese Headquarters announced the war results of the Luoyang capture on the 27th. The war results have expanded daily since then. As of the 28th, it was determined that the Japanese army's war results included 4,829 corpses abandoned by the Chongqing army, 8,286 prisoners captured, and the capture of 76 artillery pieces (4 field guns, 5 mountain guns, 20 direct-firing guns, 2 5cm howitzers, 6 rapid-firing guns, 55 mortars), 181 heavy machine guns, 6,004 rifles, 201 grenade launchers, 10 automatic rifles, 35 pistols, countless ammunition, and other items such as 31 telephones, 5 wireless radios, 5 switchboards, 1 locomotive, 4 freight cars, and 200 rails. The total number of corpses abandoned by the Chongqing army and prisoners captured was 13,115. It is said that the three divisions of the Chongqing army defending Luoyang numbered 14,000. They have now been annihilated by the Japanese army. This shows the brilliance of the war results obtained by the Japanese army in capturing Luoyang.</p>
<p>Luoyang, 29th (Central News Agency) - Regarding the reasons why the Chongqing army guarding Luoyang this time was able to resist so stubbornly, it was certainly due to the excellent equipment they possessed, but the main reason was due to the extremely solid fortifications they had. The defense of Luoyang was accomplished by the Chongqing army using all their strength and abilities to complete the most perfect and solid defensive battlefield. One kilometer south of Luoyang city is the Luo River, and to the east there are even more natural barriers to defend. It includes the northern highlands and the western plains. Here, the Chongqing army had completely built permanent fortifications. Shelters, artillery emplacements, machine gun emplacements, communication trenches, tank trenches, and countless large and small fortresses were built everywhere in the city. The tank trenches were 10 meters wide and 5 meters deep, all dug in a cross shape or spider web shape, so that even if one place was breached, other places could still be preserved. The largest tank trenches were 10 meters wide and 20 meters deep, and water was injected into them, extending 50 to 60 kilometers to the north and west. Communication trenches were dug under the tank trenches. There were communication cut-off trenches and fortress air-raid shelters in the city. All residential walls were used to dig loopholes. The air-raid shelters were about 20 meters deep, and continuous combat capability could be maintained in them for up to 10 days. A group of Americans who came here to inspect in February of this year praised it greatly. In addition, Baimapo and other places had countless artillery emplacements and large fortresses that could accommodate hundreds of people. Various military facilities were set up in a corner of the new city in the west, a river defense battlefield in the south, and natural barriers that could be used in the east. Also, the field fortifications were built in a three-dimensional shape near the city walls, so it is no exaggeration to call them strong fortifications that are difficult to attack and impossible to fall. But in the end, they could not stop the Japanese army's advance. As the saying goes, "Whoever controls Ximapo can capture Luoyang." But after the general attack by the Japanese army unit occupying the northern highlands, they finally captured it in one fell swoop. The Japanese army, which broke through such solid fortifications, had an astonishing fighting spirit.</p>
<p>The Cityscape of Luoyang is Refreshed</p>
<p>Luoyang, 29th (Central News Agency) - On the second day (26th) after the fall of Luoyang, the Public Security Maintenance Association was established. The acting chairman was Qin Peiqing. Under Qin's command, the general public engaged in cleaning, organizing, and bridge-building. On the 27th, the Louchi in Beida Street was already open for business. The brave Japanese soldiers, who had long suffered from the war, happily went there. Propaganda teams dispatched into the city distributed food to the citizens with a gentle attitude, so the citizens were all grateful. The 94th Division of the 14th Army of the Chongqing army, which guarded Luoyang, issued six announcements of "Military Law Compliance Regulations" to its troops two or three days before the fall of Luoyang. Among the captured Chongqing army soldiers, some showed a cold smile at this. Luoyang City, which is about to be turned into ruins, has taken a giant step towards building a new China due to the cleaning and reorganization.</p>
<p>The First War Zone is Thoroughly Destroyed</p>
<p>Central News Agency Report - The anti-Japanese organization in the Chongqing First War Zone has been completely destroyed due to the recent Henan campaign. At this time, the movements of Hu Zongnan's troops, known as 400,000 strong, guarding the Yellow River can be noted. To this day, the fact that the Yellow River Defense Army, with Xi'an in Shaanxi as its center, is taking a position of encirclement against Yan'an, which is occupied by the Chinese Communist Party, is a well-known fact. Due to the Japanese army's recent operation in Henan, sweeping through the First War Zone, the Chongqing authorities ordered Hu Zongnan to send six divisions, about 50,000 troops, to assist in the Luoyang area. However, Hu Zongnan's army, which was ordered to provide assistance, and Jiang Dingwen's troops were suddenly defeated by the Japanese army south of Luoyang. However, the main force of the Yellow River Defense Army still looks down on the Chinese Communist Party and seems to be unmoved, and has not taken any defensive measures against the Japanese army. This fact clearly shows the extent of the friction between Chongqing and the Chinese Communist Party. In the current Chongqing-Communist talks, lifting the Yellow River Defense Army's encirclement of the Communist army must be one of the important demands put forward by the Chinese Communist Party. If this issue cannot be resolved in the end, the Chinese Communist Party will inevitably turn a deaf ear to Chongqing's demands, which is to be expected. However, from Chongqing's standpoint, if the encirclement of the Chinese Communist Party is lifted, it is tantamount to recognizing the free development of the Chinese Communist Party. Furthermore, Chongqing will use the Communist army as its defensive force to avoid its own losses. Therefore, both Chongqing and the Chinese Communist Party will insist on their respective positions on the resolution of this issue until the end.</p>
<p>Chongqing Army Commander Li Jiayu Killed in Action</p>
<p>Kaifeng, 29th (Central News Agency) - The headquarters of the 36th Army Group of the Chongqing army was thoroughly hit on the 21st at Daying due to the fierce attacks of our troops. In that battle, it was reported that the life and death of the army group commander was unknown. Later, it was confirmed that he had been killed in action. The heads of the staff office and adjutant's office were mostly killed or captured, so the headquarters had collapsed. Li Jiayu was from Sichuan Province, born in 1889, and graduated from the Sichuan Military Academy. He served as the commander of the 100th Division and concurrently the commander of the 47th Army. Since last year, he has been working hard to increase his combat power along the Longhai Railway in the Xin'an area.</p>
<p>Beiping, 29th (Central News Agency) - On the afternoon of the 21st, Japanese troops attacked more than 1,000 Chongqing troops about four kilometers south of Daying (west of Shanzhou). The Japanese troops stormed into the Chongqing army's position with hand grenades, inflicting heavy damage. In this battle, the Chongqing army left behind 150 corpses (including many generals and officers) and 60 prisoners. The Chongqing army had retreated from Xin'an and was originally under the command of Li Jiayu. It has now been determined that it was the 36th Army Group, and the headquarters of the 49th Army was also established. Among the prisoners were Major General Zhou Dingming, chief of the adjutant's office of the army group, and a dozen other officers. Chief Zhou died soon after being captured due to serious injuries, so the Japanese army buried him. The army group commander and chief of staff have already escaped, but there are rumors that three bodies resembling important figures have been found, so it is not known whether they died in battle. Also, according to the prisoners, the commander of the 104th Division has already been killed in action.</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Chu Arrived in Tokyo Yesterday Morning for Official Business</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) - Chu Minyi, Foreign Minister of the National Government, arrived in Tokyo on the morning of the 29th for official business in Japan. At 6 p.m., he and Ambassador to Japan Cai Pei jointly hosted a banquet for Japanese Prime Minister Tojo, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki, Minister of Finance Ishiwatari, Minister of the Navy Shimada, and other ministers. It was decided that they would jointly host a banquet for Japanese Field Marshal Sugiyama, Field Marshal Nagano, Minister of Education Okabe, Minister of the Imperial Household Matsudaira, and others on the afternoon of the 30th.</p>
<p>After the Collapse of the First War Zone in Chongqing, the National Government's Construction Strength Increased</p>
<p>Zhengzhou, 29th (Central News Agency) - From the perspective of the United States and Britain, Chongqing is an advanced base for a counterattack against Japan, so they have great expectations for it. However, since the fall of Luoyang, the First War Zone in Henan has been on the verge of collapse. This Henan campaign not only militarily destroyed the 300,000 troops of the First War Zone, but also secured the connection between North China and Wuhan, and most of the Longhai Railway, giving the Japanese army a firm control over the initiative to attack Chongqing. The Henan Plain is a powerful northwestern base for Chongqing's anti-Japanese economy, but it has now been transformed into a base for the National Government to develop its power. Therefore, this has greatly strengthened the National Government's strength. After this campaign, agricultural products from Henan have been imported into peaceful areas. It is reported that the prices of food in Tianjin, Beiping, and the markets are 20% lower than before the war. The prospects for a fundamental solution to the Yellow River water control plan have emerged. Therefore, this Henan campaign has greatly strengthened the National Government's construction.</p>
<h3>Zhengzhou is Becoming Increasingly Prosperous</h3>
<p>Zhengzhou, 28th (Central News Agency) - Due to the erroneous anti-Japanese theories of the Chongqing government, the farmers of Henan Province were forcibly conscripted and driven to the front lines. Since the end of the Japanese army's operation in Henan, they have been returning one after another. For example, in Zhengzhou, the Public Security Maintenance Association and the Chamber of Commerce were established on the eighth day after the Japanese army entered the city. The police station and district offices have also begun to operate. Of the past 40,000 inhabitants, 20,000 have returned, so the market is becoming increasingly prosperous. The unique phenomenon in the area is that Japanese language schools have been established one after another. At the same time, entertainment venues such as cinemas and theaters have also begun to operate. Also, the power plant was bombed by Japanese aircraft during the incident, and the power equipment was auctioned off by the Henan Provincial Government last summer, so there is still no street lighting equipment. Recently, the authorities have installed electric lights in several places, and it is planned to install electric lights along the Pinghan and Longhai Railways soon.</p>
<h3>Dr. Sasaki Talks About His Impressions of Lecturing</h3>
<p>Dr. Sasaki, a Japanese agriculturalist, was invited to give lectures at the academic lecture series of this newspaper. A reporter from the Dalu Xinbao interviewed the doctor, who said about his impressions: "Although it is called an academic lecture series, the audience is not specialized, so I avoided going into too much depth. What I lectured on mainly focused on the importance of the foundations of Chinese agriculture and the necessity of Sino-Japanese cooperation from an agricultural point of view. The topic in Shanghai was 'Japan, China, and the United States and Britain as Seen from Agriculture.' In Nanjing, I plan to focus on my specialty, animal husbandry, and lecture on 'China's Animal Husbandry and its Resources as Seen from East Asian Animal Husbandry.' I have attended academic conferences held in the United States and Britain, and have also investigated the agriculture of various countries, so I was able to list specific figures to compare and demonstrate the agriculture of various countries. I explained that the commonalities between China and Japan in agriculture are extremely large, so that students can understand. China and Japan are inseparable, and I will emphasize that Japanese agriculture is the best in the world, manufacturing Holstein dairy cows that produce 102 shi of milk per year, and White Leghorn chickens that lay 364 eggs per year. This kind of technology should of course be introduced to China. Importing British and American technology is actually harmful and useless in China. In Nanjing, in addition to lecturing and holding seminars, I also plan to visit various farms and Chinese agriculture in person."</p>
<h3>Indian Soldiers Awaken and Join the National Army</h3>
<p>Yangon, 29th (Central News Agency) - The enemy near Kohima is currently increasing the number of British soldiers sent from Dimapur to open the highway from Kohima to Imphal. However, the number of British soldiers mobilized has reached its limit, so the rear service personnel recently are making every effort to use older soldiers. At the same time, the surveillance and supervision of Indian soldiers under command has become stricter, in an attempt to strengthen the will to resist Japan. On the 22nd, the Japanese army launched a bayonet attack on Height 460 west of Kohima. Indian Sikh soldier Kexenki, who escaped from an enemy armored vehicle and surrendered to the Japanese army, recently described the British's brutal behavior towards Indian soldiers as follows: "The British's brutality towards us Indians is no different from drinking our blood and eating our flesh. We now fully understand the British soldiers' deceptive tactics towards us. The voices of joining the National Army are rising daily. Machine guns are set up behind the first-line Indian soldiers no matter when they retreat. British surveillance and supervision of Indian soldiers is even stricter at night. If there is any intention to retreat, they will be shot immediately. Indian soldiers have lost their will to fight due to excessive fear of this kind of behavior. We call the supervisors 'guides to hell', so the number of people joining the National Army is increasing day by day. During our armored vehicle unit's attacks, there must be British soldiers monitoring in the rear, or firing shots in the rear to supervise the battle. From now on, we swear to avenge this hatred, quickly wake up, and join the National Army."</p>
<h3>American Planes Attacked Nanying and Were Defeated</h3>
<p>Xinxiang, 29th (Central News Agency) - The American troops stationed in Chongqing stubbornly attacked in order to prevent the rapid advance of the Japanese army. On the 12th, 28 Chongqing planes attacked the Japanese army near Nanying (20 kilometers west of Luoyang). The Japanese army fought back with anti-aircraft fire and repelled them after inflicting heavy damage. An enemy plane (F40 type) was forced to land due to a mechanical failure. An American pilot was captured. According to the captured pilot, "At first, we thought that the Japanese army unit in the area had no anti-aircraft guns and we could bomb safely. But we completely misjudged. I am deeply horrified when I think about the vigorous fighting spirit of the Japanese army. We came to the Chinese mainland with the aim of air-raiding the Japanese mainland. Now that we have come into contact with the Japanese army, we are disappointed."</p>
<h3>After Obtaining Southern Resources, Japan's Petroleum Business Changed</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) - Before the war, Japan's kerosene situation was almost the same as Germany's. Domestic resources were scarce, and artificial petroleum could not be fully developed. In terms of artificial kerosene, its situation was even worse than Germany's. In the 11th year of Showa (1936), Japan's domestic oil production was about 400,000 tons, which was only 8% of the total demand. The amount imported from other places reached 5 million tons. However, since obtaining southern oil resources, Japan's kerosene business has changed greatly. Before the war, the production volume of kerosene in various southern regions was approximately 5.2 million tons in Sumatra, 1.8 million tons in Borneo, 840,000 tons in Java, 100,000 tons in Ceylon, and 1.1 million tons in Burma. But now the production volume in various places is several times that of before the war. However, under these wartime conditions, it is not enough to be satisfied simply because the southern oil source has been secured. The Japanese government ordered the Imperial Oil Company to carry out development in order to centrally control the domestic and foreign oil extraction businesses. In the field of oil refining, it also established the Kerosene Refining Industry Council the year before last to plan for the centralization of kerosene business operations. Now, compared with the oil business of the anti-Axis side, the Japanese side has the advantage of advancing internal line operations. Although the anti-Axis side has a large volume of oil production, they must go through a long transportation route to transport oil to the necessary battle zones. For example, the distance to transport oil from California to the Solomon Islands in the Western Pacific war zone is more than 6,000 miles. On the other hand, the Japanese side has the advantage of being able to quickly transport kerosene from the oil fields to the battle zones due to the development of the local oil refining business. Although the absolute amount of assets is inferior to the enemy, from another perspective, the Japanese side can fully secure the necessary amount of kerosene and quickly turn it into combat power. In this respect, its advantage is several times that of the enemy.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency) - Zhang Bingquan, chief secretary of the Ministry of Industry, met with reporters on the 29th and made the following remarks regarding the general situation of recent work: "The work of the Ministry focuses on increasing production and stabilizing people's livelihoods. We are still implementing the previously established plan, the important points of which are as follows: Regarding increasing production, (A) Cotton: For increasing cotton production, the Cotton Production Increase Coordination General Association was recently established in Shanghai, and local coordination associations were established in various cotton-growing areas to promote and develop cotton cultivation. The area is approximately 3 million mu, and it is estimated that cotton production this year can reach 2.5 million dan. Also, in order to prevent the mixing of cotton quality, over 1,180 mu of original seeds have been carefully planted. The situation is good, and after the autumn harvest this year, they can be used for promotion next year. (B) Hemp: The propagation of jute and kenaf in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Nanjing, and Shanghai has been promoted to 20,000 mu. Castor beans: 3,000 mu in the Wuhu area, and 7,000 mu in Taixian. (C) Mulberries: 500,000 excellent spring silkworm egg sheets were imported from Japan and distributed by industry agencies in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other regions. (D) Rice: Last year, the improved rice seeds distributed to various areas were better than the local varieties. The Ministry instructed various regions to guide farmers to exchange local varieties for the improved varieties planted by farmers. (E) Coal Mines: The Ministry encourages people to mine coal. Recent surveys show that Jiangning and Jurong produce more than 150 tons of coal per day, and Guichi, Fanchang, and Chaoxian produce more than 80 tons of coal per day. The number of mine operators applying for resumption of business and reporting the start of work has increased recently. (F) Promotion of agricultural economy: The Ministry signed joint agricultural loan measures with the Bank of Communications to issue funds for increasing production. The following are actively underway: (1) Revising the regulations on rural pawns, (2) Consulting the Ministry of Construction to allocate vehicles for transporting fertilizer, (3) Collecting agricultural statistical data, (4) Contracted cotton production survey. Regarding industrial and commercial surveys and price management, the Ministry, together with the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Industrial and Commercial Survey Committee, is conducting surveys of company operations. As for managing prices, we are still supervising the implementation according to the established policy. Price evaluation committees have been organized in Nanjing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang, and Huaihai. Regarding personnel, since the Ministry of Food was merged into the Ministry, the administrative affairs of the Ministry have been incorporated into the Ministry. The organizational structure of various departments has been slightly adjusted and expanded, and the number of personnel has also been slightly increased. However, the progress of the cause depends on the concentration of talents, especially in the Ministry. The selection focuses on both learning and experience, and promotions are made at any time.

<h3>Special Edition for Allied Nations' Japanese Navy Memorial Day, No. 10 – The Great Spirit of Japanese Navy Personnel</h3>
<p>Whether weapons and warships can exert their power depends entirely on the people handling them. The warships of the Japanese Navy are the most advanced in the world. In terms of hull design, speed, armor, and crew configuration, all countries are left in the dust. Moreover, its weapons, aircraft, and gunpowder have unmatched precision and performance, as demonstrated in the Greater East Asia War. However, if handled by naval personnel like those of the United States, they would ultimately fail to fully exert their power. Here, in terms of personnel, we see the reason why the Japanese Navy is the strongest in the world.</p>
<p>Japanese Navy personnel, during their training, have every Sunday of the week altered. There are no regular holidays, and half-day Saturdays are absolutely out of the question. Every week, their days are Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Friday.</p>
<p>Let's take the example of training a young aviation soldier. After joining the unit, for three years, they [unclear]. Even when flying in groups, they know where their aircraft is over the earth. Without this, how could they brave dense clouds to bomb Pearl Harbor and Darwin? Only in the fourth year do they begin to learn aviation technology, in the fifth year, shooting and bombing. In the sixth year, they practice shooting and bombing. In the sixth year, they practice on aircraft carriers. Only in the seventh year can they fly aircraft on their own. Their spirit and their skills are both indispensable to the country's aircraft.</p>
<p>The same goes for torpedoes and cannons. Marshal Dong Zheng once said, "One cannon that hits every time is equivalent to a hundred cannons that fire [unclear] hits." In every naval battle, it has been proven that each cannon operated by a Japanese soldier is equivalent to more than a hundred cannons operated by British and American gunners.</p>
<p>Submarine crew members are mostly non-commissioned officers. Submarines require excellent personnel. Volunteers who join the marine corps first undergo preliminary training in the marine corps for six months, then undergo appropriate inspections, and are separated into gunners, torpedo men, and mechanics. After receiving various specialized educations at gunnery schools, torpedo schools, and engineering schools, they practice on warships and then enter schools to learn advanced technology, constantly being trained. Those who join submarines must also enter submarine school.</p>
<p>Commanders who command these excellent soldiers, such as officers in the combat branch, graduate from the Naval Academy in Etajima. Those in the mechanical branch graduate from the Naval Mechanical School in Maiizuru. Military doctors and pharmacists graduate from the Tokyo Naval Medical School, and officers in the accounting branch graduate from the Tokyo Naval Management School.</p>
<p>Let's look at life at the Etajima Naval Academy. The school accepts students who have completed four years or more of secondary school. Lower-class students absolutely obey upper-class students. Up and down are naturally one, cultivating the traditional spirit of the Japanese Navy: "Not relying on the enemy not coming, but relying on our readiness." Whenever an enemy comes, they must be defeated. This confidence is more important than the excellence of weapons and the number of warships.</p>
<p>"Willing to die" is the noble spirit of sacrifice unique to the Japanese. "Not dying before the enemy falls" is an even more proactive and solemn spirit of attack. This spirit of attack is the manifestation of utmost sincerity in serving the country. With this sincerity, they can achieve great results in every naval battle.</p>
<h3>Lessons from the Russo-Japanese War</h3>
<p>– Miyake Keiji</p>
<p>While America produced Botzchi Nel, it proved the power of submarines to the world in actual warfare.</p>
<p>Since then, various forms of "submarines" have appeared, including the "Plodtec" created by the German rigid airship inventor Zeppelin-Laem, and the "Holland" created by the Irishman Holland. The former used a thirty-horsepower gasoline engine on the water and in the water, and could travel at eight and a half knots on the water and five and a half knots in the water, and had four wheels that could be retracted into the boat, allowing it to travel on the seabed. During the Russo-Japanese War, Russia purchased this boat and moored it in Vladivostok to snipe at the Japanese fleet.</p>
<p>Japan began to study after purchasing the Holland-type submarine, as mentioned earlier. Lieutenant Commander Sakuma's Sixth Submarine, which was said to be Holland-type, was built together with the Seventh Submarine at the Kawasaki Shipyard in Japan. Its model was the Fifth Submarine, which was ordered from the American Electric Boat Company in November of the 37th year of Meiji (1904). The reason for Lieutenant Commander Sakuma's early death was to experiment with how long this small boat, weighing only 75 tons, could dive. However, the motor was very small and could not dive for long in the water. If a gasoline engine for water use were used in the water, it could dive very far, but there was no way to dispose of the toxic gases generated at this time. In desperation, they came up with the idea of sinking the boat halfway and floating it, and drawing fresh air from the sea through the ventilation tube on the upper deck for the gasoline engine to use. This is the so-called semi-submerged navigation.</p>
<p>The Sixth Submarine sank during this kind of semi-submerged experiment when a wave hit the ventilation tube.</p>
<h3>Progress in Japanese Shipbuilding Technology</h3>
<p>What kind of warships did the Japanese Navy build during this period? Although "Tsukuba" and "Ikoma" were the beginning of battlecruisers, after Japan saw Britain build the "Invincible" class of warships, it also went on to design and build more powerful warships.</p>
<p>However, what must be considered here is whether Japan has the ability to build such giant ships. No matter how well-conceived the shipbuilding plan is, if there is no corresponding technology, warships cannot be built. Therefore, when this shipbuilding plan was drafted in the 44th year of Meiji (1911), it was generally considered an unrealistic delusion. As a result, the Diet also raised questions about shipbuilding technology, such as "Can Japan build such giant ships?" At that time, Naval Minister Saito Minoru made the following reply in the Diet.</p>
<p>"Japan has decided that all Japanese warships in the future will be built in Japan by Japanese hands. However, the first ship of this shipbuilding plan, the 'Kongo,' will be built in the United Kingdom as a technical blueprint. In the future, the warships of the Japanese Empire will absolutely not be built in foreign countries."</p>
<p>This reply not only surprised the Japanese, but also astonished Westerners. According to [unclear] Fujido's "Memoirs," the Ministry of the Navy was in an uproar after this reply was made in the Diet.</p>
<p>Although it was said that all Japanese warships in the future would be built in the country, it was already not easy to build warships such as "Kawachi" and "Settsu," and it was even more impossible to predict how huge the warships would have to be built in the future. How could they be built? However, the minister in charge actually announced it clearly in the Diet, wasn't this too rash? However, because one cannot wait passively, there is no hope for technological progress. If one simply imitates other countries or buys from other countries, then the country, like an individual, can never become strong. It is necessary to create something from nothing and to hone oneself diligently. Because Japanese people have an unwavering belief in everything, only the "Kongo" was ordered from the Vickers plant in the United Kingdom, while its sister ships, "Hiei," "Haruna," and "Kirishima," were all built in the country.</p>
<p>Not only when these three ships were completed in Japan, but even when their plans were announced, they surprised naval experts all over the world.</p>
<p>Up to that time, the largest cannon in the world was the thirteen-and-a-half-inch cannon of the British super-D-class battleship, but the Japanese Kongo-class battleship was equipped with eight fourteen-inch cannons. Can such large cannons be fitted on a warship? When Japan ordered the "Kongo" from the United Kingdom, British engineers immediately studied its design. Surprisingly, this design far surpassed all their designs, which they considered the authority in the world of shipbuilding, and approached perfection.</p>
<p>At that time, they were planning to build a larger 28,500-ton battlecruiser than the "Lion," the "Tiger." The displacement of the "Kongo" was 29,330 tons, slightly larger than the "Tiger," but much stronger. Therefore, they stopped the original plan and almost completely rebuilt the design of the "Kongo," but the cannon installed was still eight thirteen-and-a-half-inch cannons.</p>
<p>The Kongo-class battlecruisers were the largest and strongest warships in the world at that time, and their speed reached 27.5 knots, which was in no way inferior compared to the warships of other countries. Apart from the "Kongo," its sister ships were all built in Japanese shipyards.</p>
<p>The "Kongo" was the world's first cruiser to be equipped with fourteen-inch cannons. As for battleships, from the 4th to the 7th year of the Taisho era (1915, 1918), the super-D-class battleships "Fuso," built by Japan, and its sister ships "Yamashiro," "Hyuga," and "Ise," were all giant ships of 30,000 tons, each equipped with ten fourteen-inch cannons, and were the strongest battleships in the world. After they were successively commissioned, they attracted worldwide attention. These battleships and the four Kongo-class battlecruisers constituted the most ideal four-four fleet. The establishment of this fleet made the Japanese Navy the first-class navy among all the naval powers in the world. (End) (Yoshida: Excerpts from a chapter of "Naval History")</p>

The second game was between Hualian Western and Xihui Chinese. To strengthen their team, Xihui Chinese specially invited Zhuo Guorong, Ma Xixi, and Fan Qingxian, three fierce generals from Shanghai, to assist. The battle between the two sides was extremely intense. In the end, Hualian Western triumphed with a score of 25 to 22. The next day, the first game was between Hualian Western and a mixed team. Hualian Western dominated and defeated the mixed team with a score of 27 to 10. The second game was between Hualian Chinese and Xihui Chinese. Zhang Xianlun of Hualian single-handedly scored 14 points, and Fan Qinggong also had an outstanding performance. Li Zude, Gao Baosheng, and Ma Xixi of Xihui Chinese coordinated seamlessly. However, they were defeated by Hualian with a score of 30 to 31, a difference of only one point.</p>

<h3>Economic Sector's Discussion on the Establishment of the Economic Security Office</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the Economic Security Office by the First Police Bureau of this city, the business community has expressed great concern because of its close relationship with the economic sector. This newspaper has invited leaders from the economic sector to hold a discussion, exchange opinions on the expectations of the Economic Security Office, and represent the views of the general economic community. The salient points are specially published as follows:</p>
<p>Mr. Xiang Kangyuan: The establishment of the Economic Security Office is most closely related to the industrial and commercial sectors. I would like to raise a few points of hope: The various laws and regulations, prohibited fines, and inspection procedures, etc., on which the Economic Security Office's administrative facilities are based should be announced as soon as possible so that the people can abide by them. If the people violate laws and regulations, the execution of the prohibited penalties by the Security Office should be subject to a Protection Committee to ensure prudence. At the same time, the penalties should set a maximum limit. If the circumstances of the crime exceed this limit, the case should be transferred to the court for legal trial. When economic police are performing their duties, they must have special identification to avoid the occurrence of fraudulent situations. At the same time, the facilities of economic police must be suitable for the environment of the Shanghai economic sector. The treatment of economic police should be specially improved, so that they can maintain their livelihood and serve with peace of mind.</p>
<p>Mr. Li Quanshi:</p>
<p>The establishment of the Economic Security Office now is for the welfare of the citizens of Shanghai, so the economic police must be particularly capable, and each must be of noble character; otherwise, they will not only be insufficient to stabilize the economy, or even enough to disrupt the merchants and people. Originally, to successfully control the economy, the person executing the control must first be able to control his own desires. If the economic police cannot inspect themselves, then they cannot control others. This is not an overly harsh statement, but rather an overly eager expectation, so I speak sharply.</p>
<p>The mission of the economic police is economic security. The so-called "economic security" is to protect the stability of people's livelihood and the economy. To seek to ensure people's livelihood, the retail prices of all goods must be reduced, but it is also necessary to weigh the importance and execute them separately, such as vegetables, rice, coal, and salt, which are all very closely related to people's livelihood. I hope that the Economic Security Office can pay attention to this and lower their prices, especially the prices of vegetables in the small vegetable markets.</p>
<p>The lessons of the previous 清鄉 [rural cleansing] are well-known facts. I hope that the Economic Security Office can establish its reputation from the beginning and not repeat the mistakes of the past 清鄉 [rural cleansing] work, which often gave people cause for criticism.</p>
<p>It is of course best if one more agency can benefit the people. Otherwise, if it is not run well, it is better not to run it at all. In the future, I hope that the Economic Security Office can be impartial and achieve the goal of seeking welfare for the people by stabilizing prices.</p>
<p>Mr. Sun Ruihuang:</p>
<p>The Economic Security Office is a temporary agency established in the First Police Bureau. First, the outside world should understand its mission, so as to prevent future knowing violations of the law. There is still a lack of clear explanation, so there have been doubts in recent times. The work, investigation of human rights, and illegal practices are all for the , the key seems to lie in major commodities, but how does it work? What is considered illegal? The general public should have a clear understanding. Items such as the name, quality, and quantity of goods should be specified and explained in detail. If there is knowledge of and violation of the law, penalties should be imposed accordingly; if there is penalty without knowledge, it does not seem to be the intention of the authorities. Therefore, if the Economic Security Office can explain the details to the people before implementing its work, it can avoid many injustices and unnecessary disputes. I think this is what the people hope for.</p>
<p>Mr. Lin Kanghou:</p>
<p>The Economic Security Office is an expansion of the special high section's Economic Division. Since its establishment, we have only seen the conversation between Deputy Director Du and Division Chief Gotō, but we hope that Mayor Chen can also express his opinion. There are four agencies in Shanghai managing the economy: the Municipal Government's Economic Bureau, the Materials Investigation Committee, the Economic Division, and the Economic Security Office. My opinion is to ask the authorities to clearly disclose the respective powers and boundaries of these four agencies, so that the public can understand. The Security Office is different from the 清　局 [Bureau for the Purification of Social Customs]. We hope that it will not disturb the people in any way. The search methods in the past 清　 [Purification] areas have already made the people cry out in agony. How can they be used in Shanghai again? Security police should use civilized methods. For any illegal events, it is best to consult with the trade association first and cooperate to remedy the drawbacks. The association, due to its duty, will never intentionally protect wrongdoers.</p>
<p>What we are now asking the authorities for is: Clearly announce the powers and boundaries of the four agencies. The Security Office should be different from the 清鄉 [Rural Cleansing] Bureau. Peaceful measures should be adopted. Only after these two points are achieved can other issues be discussed.</p>
<p>Mr. Cai Shengbai: I agree very much with the opinions of the distinguished speakers I have just heard. I would like to add a few points as follows:</p>
<p>The scope of laws and regulations of the Economic Security Office must be clearly defined. At present, many wartime economic laws and regulations of the national government have been promulgated, but their meaning is profound and cannot be understood by the general public. Therefore, I hope that the authorities will compile detailed interpretations based on the laws and regulations so that the people can follow them and there will be no misinterpretations. This means that the people should be "taught before being punished, and not punished without being taught."</p>
<p>Those who violate laws and regulations should be given appropriate dispositions. If the circumstances of the violation by a store are not serious, the trade association should be notified first to advise them to change their ways and renew themselves. Because the law is nothing more than human sentiment, it is better to save trouble if the offender can correct their mistakes in time. As for whether future offenders will be judged solely by the Economic Security Office, or whether offenders can hire lawyers to defend themselves, it must also be expressly stipulated. It is best that the Economic Security Office be responsible for investigation, and the court be responsible for judgment. Economic investigation work must be simplified. At present, there are many agencies established by the central and local governments, such as the Financial Inspection Office, the Insurance Regulatory Bureau, and the Enterprise Supervision Bureau and the Industrial and Commercial Management Committee which are about to be established. There are many institutions, and their powers overlap. The central government is the superior agency, and the Economic Security Office is the subordinate agency. In the investigation work of the Security Office, if the central government has established a special investigation agency, then the Economic Security Office does not need to conduct a second investigation to avoid duplication.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Riping:</p>
<p>The establishment of the Economic Security Office is of great concern to the business community and the general public. I would like to briefly state my hopes for this matter to the government authorities and all sectors as follows:</p>
<p>Hopes for the government:</p>
<p>(A) Unification and clarification of economic laws and regulations: The current economic laws and regulations are enacted and implemented at any time, and there are many places where they are repeated and divergent, which seem to lack clarity. It is necessary to unify and訂 [revise] them. I hope that the central or local government will訂 [revise] unified economic laws and regulations, and clearly stipulate and explain in detail all matters that should be subject to control so that merchants and people can easily comply with them.</p>
<p>(B) Concentration of administrative agencies' authority: There seem to be too many economic administrative agencies in this city, and it is not easy to concentrate authority. People feel quite disturbed and do not know what to do. I hope that the government will quickly adjust and merge the overlapping economic administrative inspection agencies to concentrate authority and facilitate the implementation of government orders.</p>
<p>(C) Fair penalties: Penalties should be clearly stipulated and trials should be thorough to avoid unjust leniency or punishments. Minor offenses should be subject to administrative sanctions, and serious offenses should be transferred to judicial organs for handling to ensure fairness.</p>
<p>Hopes for the Economic Security Office:</p>
<p>(A) Increase the salaries of economic police and protect their positions: Due to the nature of their duties, the economic police of the Economic Security Office have more contact with the outside world and are more likely to be tempted by illegal individuals. Increasing their salaries must be enough to maintain their livelihood so that they have no internal worries. Their positions must also be protected so that they can serve with peace of mind to enhance administrative efficiency.</p>
<p>(B) Clear rewards and punishments: Increasing the salaries of economic police and protecting their positions are not enough to be considered perfect. It is necessary to determine rewards and punishments based on whether they perform their duties diligently. Those who have made meritorious contributions should be rewarded; those who abuse the law for personal gain should be severely punished according to the law. If rewards and punishments can be clearly defined, it will be enough to encourage their service spirit.</p>
<p>(C) Careful selection of talent: Since the salaries of economic police are excellent, those with good character and academics should be carefully selected to fill the positions, so as to be honest and impartial, act in the public interest, and be able to guide merchants and people to jointly abide by the law.</p>
<p>Hopes for the public:</p>
<p>(A) Citizens should follow the government's wartime economic policy: During this time of war, the government is implementing a wartime controlled economic policy. All sectors of industry and commerce should cooperate in promoting it to prevent the lack of materials and the soaring of prices, which would harm people's livelihood and affect the war. If merchants and people are each self-disciplined, there will be no violation of economic laws and regulations, and they will be spared 처 [treatment].</p>
<p>(B) Relevant groups and media should guide citizens to abide by the law: The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, various trade associations, baojia [neighborhood watch] self-defense groups, and various groups related to the welfare of citizens should guide and advise merchants and people from time to time not to hoard, seek illegal profits, or violate economic laws and regulations. This is also the best way to prevent it from happening.</p>
<p>(C) Jointly eliminate illegal activities: It is true that economic police exercise their powers as a countermeasure to crack down on hoarding and profiteering. However, given the density of the population and the vastness of the area in this city, if all parties can jointly cooperate and report at any time, it will be a good way to eliminate illegal activities. Not only can violations of economic laws and regulations be prevented, but also other illegal activities can be reduced.</p>
<p>Mr. Yao Qingsan:</p>
<p>The distinguished speakers have given many excellent opinions, and I would like to add a few more points. I believe that the Economic Security Office is of great importance to the livelihood of all citizens, and its every move should have a legal basis and at the same time be consistent with the facts.</p>
<p>The so-called legal basis means that the Regulations for Punishing the Crime of Hoarding Important Goods, which were promulgated by the government, should be the general basis for the office to investigate materials in the future, but the articles are too simple. Supplementary detailed rules must be made when implementing them. I hope that the government will clearly stipulate this point so that violators know what articles and clauses they have violated and what they are guilty of.</p>
<p>The so-called consistent with the facts means that it must consider all aspects of the facts. For example, when setting a price limit, it must be suitable for the cost of the goods. If the price limit is not suitable for the cost, then the merchants will definitely feel distressed. Another example is the matter of gold trading. It has never been expressly prohibited by law, but in fact the government also uses gold to buy cotton yarn. Those who buy and sell gold get their gold bars from the sale of cotton yarn. Is it guilty after all, and how can it be innocent? The government should also explain it clearly.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is necessary to clearly define the scope of powers of the Economic Security Office. I believe that if the central government has directly established a management agency for a certain industry in Shanghai, it should not be subject to the interference of the Economic Security Office. At present, the central government has established a Financial Inspection Office for the banking industry, an Insurance Regulatory Bureau for the insurance industry, and an Enterprise Supervision Bureau for various enterprise companies. There is no need for local governments to do what the central government has already done to avoid duplication of powers.</p>
<p>In short, the work of the Economic Security Office is passive, and it can only punish after the violation of the law. If you want to prevent problems before they occur, you must engage in active work, that is, stabilizing people's livelihood. After people's livelihood is stable, economic crimes can be reduced.</p>

<h3>Giving a Concrete Example: Injustice: The Actions of the Wujiang Office of the Rice Control Association</h3>
<p>Wujiang County in Garupan is a rice-producing area, so the brewing industry has always been very developed, second only to Suzhou. Last year, due to restrictions on the use of glutinous rice for brewing, the Jiangsu Provincial Grain Bureau issued an order requiring all brewers to apply for permission before they could brew. All merchants complied because it was a matter of grain administration. Later, the Grain Bureau separately determined the amount of brewing, reducing it by about 40% of the brewing volume of the previous year. At that time, the Rice Control Association did not move or issue any regulations. Unexpectedly, in March of this year, when the new wine was about to be released, the Wujiang Office of the Rice Control Association suddenly sent a notice to the Suzhou-Wujiang Brewing Industry Association, stating:</p>
<p>After verifying the brewing volume submitted by the Suzhou-Wujiang Brewing Industry Association, it is found to be in line with the quantity set by the Jiangsu Provincial Grain Bureau. We are now reporting this for your review. It has been found that Wujiang brewers directly purchase glutinous rice without permission and should be treated as privately hoarding rice according to the law. Considering their ignorance, they should complete the procedures for the rice they have purchased for brewing according to the association's allocation methods, that is, the association's purchase price is 820 yuan per dan [unit of dry measure], and the allocation price is 1,800 yuan, a difference of 980 yuan per dan. Please promptly order the merchants to calculate based on the actual brewing volume of 33,996 dan [unit of dry measure] and send the difference to the association as soon as possible. Therefore, after verification, the merchants purchased and transported glutinous rice directly without the approval of the association, destroying the regulations and disregarding public orders, which is very wrong. All differences are hoped to be督飭 [supervise and order] and迅 [promptly]解 [delivered] by the merchants in full, so that it can be reported for closing. Please do not delay, and hope that you will investigate and handle this matter.</p>
<p>The brewing of various merchants has been approved by the Grain Bureau. What is wrong? The Rice Control Association had no plans to purchase glutinous rice in advance, and had no allocation of rice to the brewers afterwards. In fact, they want to seize the so-called difference of 31,326,080 yuan with a piece of paper, gaining without labor. How can there be such a thing in the world? It is heard that the merchants are planning to jointly request the higher authorities to thoroughly investigate. Moreover, Suzhou and Wujiang are in the same association, and the circumstances of buying rice and brewing wine are exactly the same. The Rice Control Association does not mention Suzhou, but only Wujiang, because Suzhou is the provincial capital area, and they dare not act rashly, fearing criticism. Wujiang is a remote rural area. Although the Rice Control Association is not an official yamen [government office], it is more than enough to scare the country folks. At this time, the person in charge of the Rice Control Association, who is entrusted with the important task of national grain administration after Hou Hubu was executed, dares to follow in his footsteps and test the law with his own body. It may be that he wants money and does not want his life, but the country folks have the pain of losing both their lives and their money.</p>

<p>— Iwata Yu, Hong Yang</p>
<p>Letter to My Sister (6)</p>
<p>This monument to despair is ten times larger than the Nakamoto Tekshin monument at the Second Middle School. On the back is an inscription in English. Losing half of it makes me feel very uncomfortable.</p>
<p>(The Japanese people of the Meiji era certainly did not sincerely appreciate Perry; there must have been other unspeakable reasons why they had to express their gratitude in this way.)</p>
<p>That's the only explanation.</p>
<p>The panoramic painting the landlady mentioned is outside the circle of the monument. In a simple little shed are displayed childish and clumsy paintings of warships, maps of that time, and photographs of Perry, etc. Perry's face has no hair, he looks very young, and he wears a one-eyed glasses. He always looks like he's winking and grimacing, with wide cheekbones like today's U.S. President Roosevelt.</p>
<p>(Is he trying to poke at the eyes of the Japanese with an American finger!) Thinking of this, I couldn't help but laugh. Then, my husband walked towards the sandy beach. Tired of walking, we sat down on the soft sand.</p>
<p>In the morning sun, the surface of the sea rippled with small waves. In the waves, it seemed like schools of silver fish were jumping, reflecting the sunlight. On the opposite shore, there were many mountains stretching endlessly. (How beautiful the sea is!) I haven't appreciated the sea for a long time. I seemed to have forgotten that I didn't sleep well last night and felt really refreshed.</p>
<p>(A very high mountain presents itself in front. Although not as high as Mount Osumi, its shape is somewhat cylindrical.)</p>
<p>He didn't know the names of Mount Kano or Mount Nokogiri, but he noticed that the continuous mountains in the sea were heading towards the old office. On this sea, there is naturally no elegant charm like Cherry Island, nor is there a fragrant pine forest. It really looks like it has been attacked by ships. The blue expanse of this sea and the surrounding mountains are exactly the same as the Tenpōzan beach where I used to play with others.</p>
<p>(How beautiful the sea is!)</p>
<p>He said this again in his heart. Real people also like the sea. Perhaps Takao likes it even more. However, one has become a marine athlete, while the other has become a despairing painter suffering from the world. The two people who once loved the sea equally are now worlds apart.</p>
<p>(The sea is so beautiful! But I have become someone who cannot love the sea.)</p>
<p>Takao was again attacked by the worries of last night. It was as if a very clear mind was dyed with ink, completely turning black.</p>
<p>(What am I doing coming to the beach? I shouldn't have come. I should go back to the Kurihama Inn and finish writing the unfinished letter from last night! Then, I'll go back to Tokyo in the afternoon!)</p>
<p>He thought of getting up at this point, but suddenly he saw something and couldn't get up.</p>
