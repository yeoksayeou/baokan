<p>社評</p>
<h3>今日社會領袖的責任</h3>
<p>上海是一個大都市，所以，上海市民的　業，大部分屬於工商界，換言之，工商界是構成上海市的主幹。工商界的領袖，就是上海社會的領袖。我們說：[今日社會領袖的責任]，就是指工商界經濟界領袖而言。　　因爲工商界是構成上海市的主榦，所以，工商界領袖對於維護上海市的責任，就特別重大。可是，自從民二十六年以後，以迄於今，上海社會領袖對於維護上海的責任，究竟認識到怎樣程度？究竟擔當到怎樣程度？我們試加坦白的覆按與檢討，卻成爲大大問題。　　我們在六月六日的社評中，提到上海人的覺悟問題，指出：[先公後私，先私後公，只私無公]三種，孰去孰取，上海市民共同覺悟，愼決選擇之道。就一般觀察，目前大部分市民能夠[先公後私]的，誠是鳳毛麟角，即能[先私後公]者，亦屬不多，而最普遍者就是[只私無公]，只知私事私利，不顧公事公利，譬如追求暴利主義者，不擇手段，不顧大衆，損人利已，惟圖私利，這是十足[只私無公]的代表。　　我們認爲社會上[只私無公]的風氣，由於一部分社會領袖所養成的。會國藩說：[風俗奚自乎？恃乎一二人之心之所響而已。]社會領袖如能以身作則，自會發生領導的影響作用，優良的倡導，自能蔚成優良的風尚，惡劣的倡導，自亦會蔚成惡劣的風尚。如今我們細加考察一部分社會領袖的作風，只圖私人事業的發展，對於公衆事業很少熱忱。甚至若干富有者，只知一已享受，即私人事業亦不知努力。　　其次，對於時局認識不清，喜聽謠言，抱[等待主義]。認爲歐局二三個月即可結束，似乎東亞方面有聯帶關係，結束之期亦不在遠。對於反宣傳，輕易聽信，譬如說渝蔣將重來上海等等流言，其實重慶目前全受美人挾持，試問重慶如果本身仍有力量，何致以長沙衡陽重要之地，不能力守。在大東亞戰爭以前，我們也常常聽到無稽謠言，說什麼中秋到上海吃月餅，除歲到上海吃年夜飯等等，可是，事實上都是荒誕不經，無非不能兌現的空頭支票而已。　　我們認爲過去的謠言，已有事實攻破，而對於目前的現實，再不能認識糢糊了。從遠處說，縱然歐局或將短期結束，而與東亞的關係很少影響作用。大東亞戰爭本質上是大東亞民族求解放戰，勝存敗亡的生死戰，英美不擊滅不退出東亞，則大東亞戰爭無法結束的。所以，茍安企圖是自取覆滅。從近處說，上海是上海，歐局是歐局，歐局結束，大東亞戰爭有連帶關係，固然言之過甚，而歐局結束渝蔣即將重來上海，更是無稽之談。我們在上海人的立塲，無論時局如何演變，對於上海本身的危機，我們必先隨時隨地儘力克服，莫說還促成危機呢？如果只私無公而抱等待主義，則幻想的遠景固難實現，而本身的危機已先暴發，[覆巢之下，焉有完卵]，明達如社會領袖者，或不致漠視於此吧！　　今日上海的危機，我們已經屢屢疾呼，如敵人的陰謀，就需要強化治安，增加經費。如物價暴漲，就需要取締暴利，抑平物價。所以，今日上海社會領袖的責任，消極的勿違反戰時生活，勿追求暴利主義，爲工商界矯正自私風氣。積極的熱心公益事業，爲社會謀幸福，樹立先公後私的模範。</p>

<h3>怒江日軍展開巧妙內綫戰</h3>
<p>渝遠征軍反攻被擊退　　怒江前綫十二日中央社電　怒江西岸之日軍精銳，現正以巧妙之內綫作戰，重創渝軍，蓋自五月初旬以來，內中一部美式裝備之渝雲南遠征軍，會持其豐富之人力與美軍供給之物力，作大反擊，其猛烈與反攻之積極，在渝軍方面方，實爲自事變以來值得大書特書者。又渝軍當局認爲，此次作戰不但對今後抗戰上有重大影響，且足以左右重慶今後之命運，實爲未會有之一大進攻作戰。又渝軍自作戰開始以來，犧牲已達五萬人，但仍繼續進攻，由引事實，亦可證明渝方重視此作戰之程度。現渝軍擬於奪取騰越·龍陵·拉孟·平憂各要地後，達成其控制北緬與的通來多公路之目的，故現正不惜以大量人力與物力猛攻，唯日軍對此防禦堅固·並與之展開巧妙之出血作戰，渝軍企圖極難實現。　　緬甸前綫日軍基地十二日中央社電　日駐緬航空部隊，與怒江方面之陸上部隊協力，於十日猛攻騰越及孟昌街方面之渝軍陣地，於孟昌街將勝于村中渝軍數百名完全捕護，並炸毀多數車輛，迫擊砲及機關砲。又日機隊之一部會轟炸該方面渝軍航空基地，予以重大損失，晶機五架未歸還。　　緬甸前綫日軍基地十二日中央社電　龍陵附近渝軍，因日軍連續猛攻，戰意迅即低降，加之迭次喪失要地，軍心全部動搖，該方面之日軍與航空部隊之進擊相呼應，十日對龍陵北方四公裡之（Ｖ—２）高地及龍陵東南二公里之高地加以猛攻。</p>
<h3>沿湘桂路前進日軍抵全縣</h3>
<p>柳州西安兩機塲被炸　　里斯本十二日中央社電　據合衆社重慶訊，湖南日軍自佔領零陵後，更沿湘桂鐵路向西南方前進，現已突破湖南廣西省境·到達廣西全縣，斯蒂維爾司令確承此事。按全縣距桂林僅百餘公里，爲華南防衛組織之要衝，渝軍司令部關於全縣地區之戰門尚未有所發表，其他各地區日軍刻亦前進中。　　中國前綫某基地十二日中央社電　日機隊十一日拂曉跟踪追擊來襲之敵機後，即繼續空襲柳州機塲，冒惡劣天氣及渝軍高射砲之猛擊，除炸毀停置於滑走路附近之美駐渝大型機五架外，並會使其地上設施一處起火焚燒，日機於達到止的後，即悠然歸還。　　日軍前綫某基地十二日中央社電　日空軍會於十日夜往襲西安·柳州兩機塲，將其掩護設施地區澈底粉碎，在柳州有地上施設一處起火焚燒外，並炸毀其地上之大型飛機五架，日機全部安返·</p>
<h3>日海軍省人事異動</h3>
<p>東京十二日中央社電　日海軍當局因鎭海警備司令長官後籐英次中將，轉任軍令部，其後任已決定由岡敬純中將繼之。又海軍省教育局長高木心吉少將轉任軍令部，遺缺已決定由大西新藏少將繼任。</p>
<h3>浙省府嚴禁強徵軍米</h3>
<p>杭州十二日中央社電　浙省府以所有各縣鄉僻之區，農民因囿於成見，深感過去強徵軍米之痛苦，若不設法迅予宣慰，切實獎勵增產，則今年產量勢必減少，昨特令各縣政府切實查明勸導，以裕民食，一面嚴禁軍警強徵茍求。</p>
<h3>奎貝克會議將首先商討戰略</h3>
<p>政治問題居次要地位　　里斯本十二日中央社電　海通社訊：羅斯福總統昨偕夫人及醫師麥金泰海軍　上將抵奎貝克，準備與邱吉爾首相晤談，參謀長李希上將等軍政要員數人隨行，邱吉爾繼羅斯福後抵奎貝克，邱夫人及大批官員隨行。　　里斯本十二日中央社電　德國社訊：據奎貝克官方宣告，斯達林對於奎貝克會議之邀請，已予以婉辭，斯達林稱，渠之同僚一致認爲因對德戰爭之故，渠不能離國。　　瑞典京城十三日中央社電　海通社訊：奎貝克會議之目的，尚未明瞭，英國與會代表包括陸海空軍將領及運輸大臣，則此次會議似係軍事性質。然倫敦於週末發出之消息，會力言蘇波問題之重要，英國通訊社並發表英外相艾登及美國務卿赫爾亦將前往奎貝克之消息，斯達林復拒不參加會議，殆欲避免他人窺探其秘密，且莫斯科方面亦知蘇聯對波蘭問題之態度，巳引起英美人士之不滿，目前尚未好轉。羅邱會議自將首先討論戰略問題，政治問題僅居次要地位，蘇聯之態度爲各項政治討論之重要因素，自不待言。羅斯福與邱吉爾處理歐洲問題，不能不考慮蘇聯之態度，蘇聯對保國採取之措置，自英美手中奪獲政治與軍事之主動地位，可爲明證。蘇聯之態度，顯係奎貝克會議之主要問題。</p>
<h3>德駐羅大使被羅兵擊斃</h3>
<p>百倫十二日中央社電　德國社訊，據日內瓦新聞報載斯丹埠消息：最近羅京布加勒斯特發生紛擾時，羅國士兵會將德駐羅大使基林格爾擊斃，闖蘇聯政府會要求羅方將該大使交付蘇方，羅軍此舉與蘇方要求有關，頗屬可能。</p>
<h3>荷比邊境英軍施壓力</h3>
<p>摩塞爾河上遊激戰中　　柏林十二日中央社電　海通社訊：弗蘭特德軍之避離行動，已使戰事移至此耳德河口，加拿大軍隊仍緊追德軍之後，並阻止德軍撤至荷蘭南部，亞爾培運河英第二軍企圖擴張其對岸之橋頭，並對荷蘭東北部施壓迫。美第一軍續攻墨斯特里支與阿登之間，霍奇士將軍之目標似爲亞琛盆地。美第三軍於週六重新集合後，由阿爾倫區越盧林堡邊界，已佔領盧森保城。美軍對摩塞爾中部哈根林根梅茲之壓力已稍鬆弛，美第三軍之左翼，即將由紐夫夏托進攻，摩塞爾上游現正在劇戰中。此一美軍之新移動，是否具有戰略上之重要意義，抑僅具牽制性質，目前尚不得而知。西綫南部止於蘭格勒高原，迪戎南面之德軍已依照計劃向東移動，已近貝爾福。美第七軍於柏桑松區向德軍側面襲擊，當被擊退，杜河與瑞士邊境間之德軍防綫，於貝里亞山之西及西南，亦感受敵方重大壓力。</p>
<h3>法義邊區德軍反攻</h3>
<p>柏林十二日中央社電　德國社訊：法南德軍巳於曼通以北開始反攻，該地位於法義邊區曼納哥之東，里維拉海港刻正被敵艦重砲猛轟。</p>
<h3>盛世才赴渝</h3>
<p>中央社滬訊　據油化電：前任新疆省主席盛世才，近轉任農林部長，於十一日搭機赴渝就任。</p>
<h3>青浦之行（一）華</h3>
<p>本報爲明瞭近郊各地農邨實況，派遣記者作一次短程旅行，記者奉命，先以青浦爲目的地。　　踏上青浦道　　九月八日上午七時三十分，在細雨濛濛中出發，至大上海路福建路的南端，坐上了開往青浦的汽車，片刻車行，經長安路後，穿越鐵路，有長安路警察派出所檢查居住證。不數步，便是江海關徵收分所，同卒中有携帶商品，都照例完稅。再西，到了大檢問所，全體乘客，都須下車步行，經過檢問所的詳細檢查後，重行上車，復向西進。　　同車有陶君者，係青浦金澤人，原是薄有田產的世家子，近因生活高漲，小本營生，他對於我由淺及深，由遠及近的關於鄉邨間農民生活，和經濟狀況的談話，很供給了不少資料，當我看到一片綠茵的大自然境界之際，不禁脫口而出；[今年的收成，大約很可樂觀吧？]答稅：[早稻的收成，已被炎夏的亢旱，和前幾天的疾風暴雨所摧殘，至多不過五成六成的收獲，晚稻卻還在未定之天，假使這幾天仍有疾風暴雨的襲擊，將彼吹折無遺，恐其較諸日來正在收割的早稻，還要差得多，好在這幾天陰晴微雨·尚不致有何妨碍，但願天從人願，晚稻能十足收成，纔是青浦農民之福！]　　從陶君的談話裹，我開始留心到兩旁隴畝中，那些已經黃熟的禾稻，大槪便是他所說的早稻，在一片碧綠青葱的晚稻之中，也偶爾東一坵，西一坵地有着幾處，大都東倒西歪，它的數量似乎很是有限。　　車行約兩小時許，到達青浦之艮成門——谷稱東門——車止於艮成門外之吊橋堍，乘客紛紛下車，各付以車資三百五十元。　　一車後，沿城河繞到北門大街，這裹是青浦鬧市，大小商店，鱗次櫛比，記者下榻[青浦大旅社]，小小的一間，僅容一榻，除茶几，方櫈之外，別無長物，但所標價目，卻較上海同樣旅社爲高，需一百三十二元，外加特捐二十元。　　農邨情形　　青浦是個產米之區，人民十九是依農爲生，住在鄉邨間的，又十九是佃戶，往歲大都差足自給，但最近一兩年來，卻有民不聊生之苦，這其間層層剝削，固然是一個絕大的原因，但是佃戶本身的不自振刷，也有相當關係，僅就睹博而方，今年春初，朱家閣賭窟未禁絕之際，一般少壯之流，趨之若鶩，博　博夜，廢寢忘餐，傾家者，自殺者時有所聞，這在農閑時期，實在閑空的無事可做，纔想到如何消遣這空閑的光陰，於是麻將，牌九，搖攤，彈寶種種賭博，隨處成局。至若吸食鴉片，和吸白藥粉（按即海洛英或白麵之類）的，亦復不少　　農民對於苛捐雜稅，殊感頭痛，譬如每畝三元的月捐，不論耕種與否一槪無可逃避，一旦軍旅過境，總有保甲長陪同挨戶臣時攤派食米二升或三升·其餘零星瑣屑，名目繁多，一畝之收獲有限，各處之剝削無窮，農民實覺喘不過氣來。</p>
<h3>汪兼團長訓詞勗勉將校團幹部隊九學期員</h3>
<p>南京十二日中央社電　中央陸軍將校訓練團幹部總隊九期學員·十二日補行開學典禮，陳代團長親臨主持，中樞長官出席者鮑總參謀長·葉陸長·任海長。盟邦淺海少將等及全體學員五百餘人，首由陳代團長宣讀汪委員長兼團長訓詞，繼由淺海少將代表國府軍事最高顧問致詞，繼由陳代團長宣讀陸海空軍軍人訓條，十一時禮成。　　汪團長訓詞　　今天舉行中央陸軍將校訓練團幹部總隊第九期學員開學儀式，本團長特舉數點，以資勗勉。當茲大東亞戰爭決勝階段，建軍工作更須加緊努力，建軍首軍訓練，各級幹部爲部隊訓練的中心，部隊之優劣，全視幹部之優劣爲轉移，必先有優良之幹部，始能訓練出來優良的士兵，所以雖在防務吃緊，戎馬倥惚之際，仍然抽調諸君來團受訓，俾能趕速完成建軍工作，以協力盟邦確保大後方的治安，而爭取大東亞戰爭最後的勝利。訓練的重點，　　第一，要注重國策之認識，關於國策之認識，務使現有國軍全部能確實認識東亞民族之一體性，以實現國父之大亞洲主義，東亞各民族是休戰與共，唇亡齒寒，所以東亞民族之盛衷存亡，全視大東亞戰爭勝敗以爲斷。勝則共存榮，東亞各民族均將解放，敗則覆巢之下，必要完卵，任何東亞民筆亦不能倖免，以此同甘共苦，同生共死之眞養，作爲國軍精神教育之第一義，然後武力的發動，始不致走入迷途，誤其方口（電碼不明）。　　第二，要注重軍紀的　肅，關於此點，必須做到隨時隨地都能嚴守軍紀，以爲改進各部隊之標的，軍紀是軍隊之命脈，坐臥起居，飯食之間，亦須養成其嚴守紀律之習慣，然後一令之下，始能赴湯蹈炎，在所不辭。軍隊能於平時養成此種鐵的紀律，纔能在戰塲上集中力量與頑敵搏鬥，爭取最後五分鐘的勝利。　　第三，要注重軍事技術與體力的鍛鍊，科學技術在現代戰爭中佔有很重要的地位，精神力固然是根本要圖，尚須益之以軍事技術與體力的鍛鍊，始能臻於完璧。　　諸君在團受訓期間僅僅四個月，務須晝夜孜孜於精神修養外，努力研究學術，俾學有心得，將來回防後，本其所學，教育士兵，練成勁旅，以負超復興中華，保衛東亞的責任，本國長有厚　也。</p>

<p>本市警察當局，以查近有不法之徒，假冒警察局消防處名義，擅入商店住宅，藉端勒索，爲嚴厲禁止起見，特發表談話如下：[查近有不法之徒，冒稱上海特別市警察局消防處職員，擅入店舖住宅，以檢查消防設備或私建工事（如擱樓等）爲由，藉端勒索。此種詐欺行爲，不特一般市民受其騷擾，即本局名譽，亦爲其破壞，情殊可惡。查本局消防處對於市民自置消防設備，在認爲必要之時，得派員調查，至於屋內有危險情形，經市民投書申訴，而消防處認爲有注意之必要者，亦得派員調查，惟擔任此種調查任務者，均爲士官以上之職員，各員俱穿消防處制服，並備有職員證（粘貼本人照片以資識別），此輩奉派調查之職員，倘發見不良消防設備，或危險情形，即據實報告消防處長，由消防處長以書面警告屋主或住戶，囑其改善。關於建築（如擱樓等）上之各種設施，係屬工務局所掌管，不在消防處業務範圍之內，惟消防處查見建築物有重大危險，則以書面轉知工務局核辦，從無直接派員拆毀任何建築物之辦法。市民不察，每多誤會，嗣後如遇自稱本局消防處職員，擅敢藉端敲詐者，當事人應向其索閱證員證，如無眞實據證，即係假冒，可鳴警拘辦。倘携有本局消防處職員證，而有上述不法行爲者，不防默誌其姓名官職，提出證據，報告本局消防處長，俾予以相當處分。再聞本市亦時有假冒消防處名義，推銷滅火器等消防用品，市民不察，輒受其愚。查該處對於消防用具，向不代理推銷，即查有必須裝置之處，亦必以書面通知市民，如法裝置，絕無口頭強制兜售滅火器之辦法。凡市民發見此種假冒該處名義推銷滅火器者，可立即以電話報告本局消防處（電話一五一八三），或就近向警察分局據實報告，以憑究辦。本局長深盼全市民衆與本局通力合作，遇有此種非法行爲，盡量舉發，以維法紀，有厚望焉]。</p>
<h3>南黃陂路昨發生爆炸案</h3>
<p>死七人重傷者十餘人　　據警察局司法處防犯科發表：昨（十二）日上午十時左右，本市南黃陂路（貝勒路）大興路（辣斐德路）附近，因舊鐵舖誤收危險爆炸物，而發生不幸爆炸事件，當塲炸死三人，並有十餘人受重傷。茲將詳情誌錄如下：</p>
<h3>鐵舖誤收巨型水雷</h3>
<p>南黃陂路五百二十二號永大祥水電舊鐵店，於昨日上午九時四十五分，有素業舊貨賣買之江北人曹正保及小入子兩人，扛一巨型圖鐵球前往求售，當由店主黃阿大與之接洽，因曹等索價過昂，還以十元一斤，當時曹正保以此球甚形龐大，內部或有其他附屬品，從旁撬開小洞，發現內有黑色小塊，店主即疑爲炸藥，用火燃之，未見任何作用，於是曹正保以爲內係顏料，大爲興奮，願將鐵球打開，一併出售，遂與小八子兩人抬至永大祥對面天和里弄口，用鐵鎚向該球突出部份猛擊。</p>
<h3>轟然一聲血肉橫飛</h3>
<p>詎轟然一聲，遽行爆炸，當塲血肉橫飛，硫磺飛密佈。泰山分局聞訊後，由司法股湯主任溝口副主任，率領警探駛往查看，警察總局司法處副處長蒼賢二郎亦率同鑑識科人員趕往，實行調查。結果判定該鐵球寶係巨型水雷，爆炸性極爲猛烈，當時被炸斃之曹正保小八子及行人一名，均屍體支離，慘不忍睹。其中有一屍體之上半身，竟飛至附近三樓屋頂上，同時被炸重傷者亦達七八名之多，遍地血肉狼藉，幾如恐怖地獄。</p>
<h3>又有四名重傷身死</h3>

        <h1>1944 - n253</h1>
<h3>The Responsibility of Today's Social Leaders</h3>
<p>Shanghai is a large metropolis, so the occupations of Shanghai citizens mostly belong to the industrial and commercial sectors. In other words, the industrial and commercial sector constitutes the mainstay of Shanghai. The leaders of the industrial and commercial sectors are the leaders of Shanghai society. When we speak of "The Responsibility of Today's Social Leaders," we are referring to the leaders of the industrial, commercial, and economic sectors.</p>
<p>Because the industrial and commercial sectors constitute the mainstay of Shanghai, the responsibility of the leaders of these sectors to safeguard Shanghai is particularly significant. However, since 1937 (Republic Year 26) until now, to what extent have Shanghai's social leaders recognized their responsibility to safeguard Shanghai? To what extent have they fulfilled that responsibility? If we try to conduct a frank review and examination, it becomes a major question.</p>
<p>In our editorial on June 6th, we mentioned the issue of the awakening of Shanghai people, pointing out three types: "[Putting the public before the private, putting the private before the public, and only the private without the public]." Which should be discarded and which should be chosen? It is up to the citizens of Shanghai to awaken together and carefully decide on the correct path. Based on general observation, very few citizens currently are able to "[Put the public before the private]." Even those who "[Put the private before the public]" are not numerous. The most common is "[Only the private without the public]," only knowing about private matters and private interests, disregarding public affairs and public interests. For example, those pursuing profiteering, using any means necessary, disregarding the public, harming others to benefit themselves, and only seeking private gain are perfect examples of "[Only the private without the public]."</p>
<p>We believe that the atmosphere of "[Only the private without the public]" in society is cultivated by a segment of social leaders. Zeng Guofan said: "Where do customs come from? They depend on the influence of the hearts of a few people." If social leaders can lead by example, they will naturally have a guiding influence. Excellent advocacy will naturally cultivate excellent customs, while poor advocacy will also cultivate poor customs. Now, if we carefully examine the behavior of a segment of social leaders, they only focus on the development of their private enterprises and have little enthusiasm for public undertakings. Some wealthy individuals only know how to enjoy themselves and do not even put effort into their private enterprises.</p>
<p>Secondly, there is a lack of clear understanding of the current situation, and a tendency to listen to rumors, holding onto a "[Waiting-and-see attitude]." They believe that the European situation will end in two or three months, and it seems that there is a related connection in East Asia, so the end is not far off. They easily believe in counter-propaganda, such as rumors that Chiang Kai-shek will return to Shanghai. In reality, Chongqing is currently completely controlled by the Americans. If Chongqing still had its own strength, why couldn't it defend important places like Changsha and Hengyang? Before the Greater East Asia War, we often heard unfounded rumors, such as eating mooncakes in Shanghai during the Mid-Autumn Festival, and eating New Year's Eve dinner in Shanghai during the Lunar New Year, etc. But in fact, they were all absurd and unreliable, nothing more than empty promises that could not be fulfilled.</p>
<p>We believe that past rumors have already been disproven by facts, and we can no longer have a blurred understanding of the current reality. From a distance, even if the European situation ends in the short term, it will have little impact on East Asia. The essence of the Greater East Asia War is a war for the liberation of the Greater East Asia nations, a life-and-death battle where the victor survives and the loser perishes. Unless Britain and the United States are defeated and withdraw from East Asia, the Greater East Asia War cannot end. Therefore, attempting to maintain the status quo is to court destruction. From a closer perspective, Shanghai is Shanghai, and the European situation is the European situation. It is an exaggeration to say that the end of the European situation is related to the Greater East Asia War, and it is even more absurd to say that Chiang Kai-shek will return to Shanghai when the European situation ends. From the perspective of Shanghai people, no matter how the situation evolves, we must first do our best to overcome the crises in Shanghai itself at all times and in all places, not to mention contributing to them. If we only care about private matters and hold a "waiting-and-see attitude," the imagined future will be difficult to realize, and the crises will erupt first. "When the nest is overturned, no egg remains intact." Social leaders as intelligent as you are probably would not ignore this!</p>
<p>We have repeatedly cried out about the crises facing Shanghai today, such as the need to strengthen security and increase funding to counter enemy conspiracies, and the need to crack down on profiteering and suppress prices to combat soaring prices. Therefore, the responsibility of Shanghai's social leaders today is to passively avoid violating wartime life, avoid pursuing profiteering, and correct the selfish atmosphere in the industrial and commercial sectors. Actively, they should be enthusiastic about public welfare, seek happiness for society, and set an example of putting the public before the private.</p>
<h3>Enemy Airfields Night Raided Nine Times by Japanese Aircraft in Inclement Weather</h3>
<p>Japanese Troops on Omiya and Other Islands Continue to Fight</p>
<p>Southwest Pacific Base, 12th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – From August 23rd to September 7th, Japanese bomber squadrons braved inclement weather for several consecutive days, launching nine night raids targeting enemy airfields centered on locations such as Tanambel, Biak, and Gemini Islands. They destroyed 33 enemy aircraft (including some large aircraft) and damaged more than 70 others. They also set fire to two enemy supply depots, completely reducing them to ashes, inflicting considerable damage on enemy airfield facilities. One Japanese aircraft did not return from the operations.</p>
<p>Central Pacific Japanese Base, 12th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – More than ten enemy four-engine heavy bombers attacked Iwo Jima on the 11th. Japanese garrison troops shot down two of them, and the rest were repelled.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – A dispatch from a certain base in the Central Pacific reports that dozens of flares were continuously illuminating Omiya and Tinian Islands on the night of the 9th. Japanese garrison troops are still fighting hard.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – A dispatch from a base in the Northern Pacific reports that on the morning of the 10th, enemy aircraft attacked Paramushiro Island twice, totaling nine aircraft. The Japanese garrison forces immediately engaged them, shooting down one and destroying another. There were no losses on the Japanese side.</p>
<h3>Extraordinary Session of Parliament Adjourns Yesterday, Prime Minister Issues Statement</h3>
<p>Urges Citizens to Rise Up and Support Troops on the Front Lines</p>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The 85th extraordinary session of the Japanese Parliament, having clarified both internally and externally the decisive measures to destroy the British and American governments and established a certain victory stance, concluded its five-day schedule. The closing ceremony was held at the plenary session hall of the House of Peers on the 12th. At 10:50 AM, Prime Minister Koiso and other cabinet ministers, as well as Vice-President Sasaki of the House of Peers, Presidents Okada and Uchisaki of the House of Representatives, and members of both houses, attended. At 11:00 AM, Prime Minister Koiso reverently read the imperial rescript for the closing ceremony. The closing ceremony ended at 11:05 AM.

We commend you for your deep understanding of Our intentions and your utmost efforts to fulfill your duties of cooperation under the current urgent circumstances.]"</p>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – At the closing of the 85th extraordinary session of Parliament, Japanese Prime Minister Koiso issued a statement urging citizens to rise up. He also expressed his determination to implement the certain victory measures that the government had clarified in Parliament. The main points are as follows: "This Parliament, at a time of crisis in the war situation, clarified the government's beliefs both internally and externally. At the same time, Parliament reported to the citizens the true state of the war, urging them to rise up, gather both material and spiritual strength for the war effort, address the need for this year's decisive battle, and approve additional temporary military expenditures and food production expense budgets. We are truly pleased that the House of Peers and the House of Representatives have, in Parliament, respectfully received the imperial will, carefully deliberated, and fulfilled the important responsibility of cooperation. In this Parliament, the government frankly stated the war situation and the internal and external circumstances of the country. The members of Parliament also raised questions frankly, expressing the spirit of the military, government, and people united as one, sharing worries and encouraging each other to advance toward the completion of the sacred war. The government, after receiving approval, will implement the budget plan decided this time and will rapidly and forcefully materialize the important measures clarified by the government in Parliament. At this critical time in the war, it is time for others to re-awaken, support the soldiers on the front lines, step forward to serve the country, and revitalize the imperial nation. We deeply hope that the one hundred million citizens will quickly rise up, taking the certain victory stance established by this Parliament as an opportunity."</p>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Following the usual practice, after the closing of the 85th Parliament at noon on the 12th, the Prime Minister's official residence hosted the attending members of the House of Peers and the House of Representatives, as well as various government committee members, and held various informal discussions.</p>
<h3>Former Japanese Concession's Nihonbashi Bridge in Tianjin Returned</h3>
<p>Tianjin, 12th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Nihonbashi Bridge in the former Japanese concession in Tianjin was returned to China in March of last year when the concession was recovered. Due to omissions in the written records, the bridge was only formally returned to our country at that time. Following negotiations, the formal procedures were completed yesterday, and the bridge was handed over to our country.</p>
<h3>223rd Executive Yuan Meeting</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Executive Yuan held its 223rd meeting at 9:00 AM on the 12th, passing the following important cases:</p>
<p>*   The Premier submitted a draft of the organizational regulations for the Executive Yuan's ordinary administrative personnel training institute for resolution. The resolution was passed and ordered to be promulgated and implemented by the Yuan.</p>

<h3>Rural Construction Committee Convenes Experimental County Administration Meeting</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Rural Construction Implementation Committee, in order to understand the conditions of various experimental counties as rural construction work is about to actively commence, so as to provide a basis for the promotion of the work, has scheduled a Rural Construction Implementation Committee Experimental County Administration Meeting to be held at the committee on the 13th.

<h3>Japanese Troops on the Nujiang River Launch a Clever Internal Line of Operations</h3>
<p>Chongqing Expeditionary Force Counterattack Repelled</p>
<p>Nujiang Front, 12th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The elite Japanese troops on the west bank of the Nujiang River are currently inflicting heavy losses on the Chongqing army through clever internal line operations. Since the beginning of May, a portion of the Chongqing Yunnan Expeditionary Force, equipped with American equipment, has launched a major counterattack with its abundant manpower and the material support provided by the American military. The intensity and aggressiveness of this counterattack are truly noteworthy in the Chongqing army's history since the start of the Incident. Furthermore, the Chongqing military authorities believe that this operation will not only have a significant impact on the War of Resistance in the future, but will also be enough to sway the destiny of Chongqing in the future. It is truly an unprecedented major offensive operation. Moreover, since the start of the operation, the Chongqing army has suffered 50,000 casualties, but it continues to attack. These facts also demonstrate the degree to which Chongqing attaches importance to this operation. The current intention of the Chongqing army is to achieve its goal of controlling northern Burma and the Ledo Road after capturing key locations such as Tengchong, Longling, Lameng, and Pingyou. Therefore, it is currently attacking fiercely with a large amount of manpower and material resources. However, the Japanese army has established a solid defense against this and has launched a clever attrition warfare. The Chongqing army's attempt is extremely difficult to realize.</p>
<p>Japanese Base on the Burma Front, 12th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Japanese air force stationed in Burma, in cooperation with the ground forces in the Nujiang area, launched a fierce attack on the Chongqing army positions in the Tengchong and Mengchangjie areas on the 10th. In Mengchangjie, they completely captured several hundred Chongqing troops in Sheng Yu Village and destroyed a large number of vehicles, mortars, and anti-aircraft guns. A portion of the Japanese air force also bombed the Chongqing army air base in that area, inflicting heavy losses. Five Japanese aircraft did not return.</p>
<p>Japanese Base on the Burma Front, 12th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The morale of the Chongqing army near Longling has rapidly declined due to the continuous fierce attacks by the Japanese army. In addition, they have repeatedly lost key locations, and the morale of the entire army has been shaken. The Japanese army and air force in that area coordinated their attacks, launching a fierce attack on the (V-2) high ground 4 kilometers north of Longling and the high ground 2 kilometers southeast of Longling on the 10th.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Advance Along Hunan-Guangxi Railway, Reaching Quanzhou County</h3>
<p>Liuzhou and Xi'an Airfields Bombed</p>
<p>Lisbon, 12th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – According to a United Press report from Chongqing, after occupying Lingling, Japanese troops in Hunan have advanced southwestward along the Hunan-Guangxi Railway and have now crossed the border between Hunan and Guangxi provinces, reaching Quanzhou County in Guangxi. Commander Stilwell confirmed this matter. Quanzhou County is only about 100 kilometers from Guilin and is a key point in the South China defense organization. The Chongqing military headquarters has not yet released any information regarding the battle in the Quanzhou County area. Japanese troops in other areas are also currently advancing.</p>
<p>A Certain Japanese Base on the China Front, 12th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – After tracking and pursuing enemy aircraft that attacked at dawn on the 11th, Japanese aircraft squadrons continued to raid the Liuzhou airfield, braving inclement weather and heavy anti-aircraft fire from the Chongqing army. In addition to destroying five large American aircraft stationed near the runway, they also set fire to one of the ground facilities. After achieving their objectives, the Japanese aircraft returned leisurely.</p>
<p>A Certain Japanese Front Base, 12th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Japanese air force raided the Xi'an and Liuzhou airfields on the night of the 10th, completely destroying their protective facilities. In Liuzhou, one of the ground facilities caught fire, and five large aircraft on the ground were destroyed. All Japanese aircraft returned safely.</p>
<h3>Personnel Changes in the Japanese Ministry of the Navy</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Japanese naval authorities have transferred Vice Admiral Eiji Goto, commander of the Chinkai Naval Defense District, to the Naval General Staff. His successor has been decided as Vice Admiral Takazumi Oka. Also, Rear Admiral Kokichi Takagi, Director of the Education Bureau of the Ministry of the Navy, has been transferred to the Naval General Staff. The vacancy has been decided to be filled by Rear Admiral Shinzou Onishi.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Provincial Government Strictly Prohibits Forced Conscription of Military Rice</h3>
<p>Hangzhou, 12th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Zhejiang Provincial Government believes that in all remote areas of the province, farmers deeply resent the past pain of forced conscription of military rice due to preconceived notions. If no measures are taken to quickly comfort them and earnestly encourage increased production, this year's yield will inevitably decrease. Yesterday, it specially ordered the county governments to thoroughly investigate and persuade, in order to enrich the people's food supply. At the same time, it strictly prohibits the military and police from forcibly conscripting rice in a perfunctory manner.</p>
<h3>Quebec Conference Will First Discuss Strategy</h3>
<p>Political Issues Take Secondary Importance</p>
<p>Lisbon, 12th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Reuters reports: President Roosevelt, along with his wife and physician, Admiral McIntire, arrived in Quebec yesterday to prepare for a meeting with Prime Minister Churchill. Chief of Staff General Leahy and several other military and political figures accompanied him. Churchill arrived in Quebec after Roosevelt, accompanied by Mrs. Churchill and a large number of officials.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 12th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The German News Agency reports: According to an official announcement from Quebec, Stalin has declined the invitation to the Quebec Conference. Stalin stated that his colleagues unanimously believe that he cannot leave the country due to the war against Germany.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 13th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Reuters reports: The purpose of the Quebec Conference is not yet clear. The British delegation includes army, navy, and air force generals, as well as the Minister of Transport, suggesting that the conference is military in nature. However, news released from London over the weekend emphasized the importance of the Soviet-Polish issue, and the British news agency published news that British Foreign Secretary Eden and U.S. Secretary of State Hull will also travel to Quebec. Stalin's refusal to attend the conference is probably to avoid others spying on his secrets, and Moscow is also aware that the Soviet Union's attitude towards the Polish issue has caused dissatisfaction among British and American people and has not improved. The Roosevelt-Churchill conference will first discuss strategic issues, with political issues taking only secondary importance. The Soviet Union's attitude is an important factor in all political discussions, which goes without saying. Roosevelt and Churchill cannot ignore the Soviet Union's attitude when dealing with European issues. The measures taken by the Soviet Union towards Poland are clear evidence of seizing political and military initiative from the hands of Britain and the United States. The Soviet Union's attitude is clearly the main issue of the Quebec Conference.</p>
<h3>German Ambassador to Romania Shot Dead by Romanian Soldiers</h3>
<p>Bern, 12th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The German News Agency reports, citing a report from the Stanbol News in Geneva: During the recent disturbances in Bucharest, the capital of Romania, Romanian soldiers shot dead the German Ambassador to Romania, Killinger. The Soviet government has reportedly requested that the Romanian side hand over the ambassador to the Soviet side. The Romanian army's move is related to the Soviet request, which is quite possible.</p>
<h3>British Forces Exert Pressure on Dutch-Belgian Border</h3>
<p>Fierce Fighting on Upper Moselle River</p>
<p>Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Reuters reports: The German troops' withdrawal has shifted the fighting to the Scheldt Estuary. Canadian troops are still closely pursuing the German troops and preventing them from retreating to southern Holland. The British Second Army on the Albert Canal is attempting to expand its bridgehead on the opposite bank and is putting pressure on northeastern Holland. The U.S. First Army continues to attack between Maastricht and Ardennes. General Hodges's goal seems to be the Aachen Basin. After regrouping on Saturday, the U.S. Third Army crossed the Luxembourg border from the Arlon area and has occupied Luxembourg City. The U.S. pressure on Hagenlingen-Metz in the central Moselle area has eased slightly. The left wing of the U.S. Third Army will soon advance from Neufchâteau. Fierce fighting is currently taking place on the upper reaches of the Moselle. Whether this new movement of the U.S. military has strategic significance or is only diversionary in nature is currently unknown. The southern end of the western front is at the Langres Plateau. The German troops south of Dijon have moved eastward according to plan and are close to Belfort. The U.S. Seventh Army launched a flank attack on the German troops in the Besançon area and was repelled. The German defense line between the Doubs River and the Swiss border, west and southwest of the Béria Mountains, is also under heavy pressure from the enemy.</p>
<h3>German Counterattack in French-Italian Border Area</h3>
<p>Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The German News Agency reports: German troops in southern France have begun a counterattack north of Menton, which is located east of Ventimiglia in the French-Italian border area. The Riviera harbor is currently being heavily bombarded by enemy warships.</p>
<h3>Sheng Shicai Goes to Chongqing</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Shanghai Dispatch – According to a telegraph from Yuhua: Sheng Shicai, the former Chairman of Xinjiang Province, has recently been transferred to the position of Minister of Agriculture and Forestry and took a flight to Chongqing on the 11th to assume his post.</p>
<h3>A Trip to Qingpu (1) Hua</h3>
<p>In order to understand the actual conditions of the rural villages in the suburbs, this newspaper dispatched a reporter to make a short trip. The reporter was ordered to first take Qingpu as his destination.</p>
<p>Setting Foot on the Qingpu Road</p>
<p>At 7:30 AM on September 8th, I departed in the misty rain. At the southern end of Great Shanghai Road and Fujian Road, I boarded the bus bound for Qingpu. After a moment of driving, after passing Chang'an Road, I crossed the railway, where the Chang'an Road police station checked residency permits. After a few steps, it was the Jianghai Customs Collection Branch. Fellow travelers carrying goods all paid taxes as usual. Further west, we arrived at the Great Inspection Post, where all passengers had to get off and walk, undergoing a detailed inspection by the inspection post before re-boarding the bus and continuing westward.</p>
<p>One of the fellow travelers, Mr. Tao, was from Jinze in Qingpu. He was originally from a family with some land. Recently, due to the rising cost of living, he was engaged in small-scale business. His conversation with me about the lives and economic conditions of farmers in the countryside, from shallow to deep, and from far to near, provided a lot of information. When I saw a green and lush natural landscape, I couldn't help but exclaim, "This year's harvest should be very optimistic, right?" He replied, "The early rice harvest has been ravaged by the scorching summer drought and the recent gales and torrential rains, with at most only 50-60% of the harvest. The late rice is still uncertain. If there are still gales and torrential rains in the next few days, blowing them down completely, I fear that it will be much worse than the early rice currently being harvested. Fortunately, the weather has been cloudy with light rain these past few days, so it shouldn't cause any harm. I only hope that heaven will grant our wishes, and the late rice can be fully harvested, that will be the blessing of the farmers in Qingpu!"</p>
<p>From Mr. Tao's conversation, I began to pay attention to the already yellowed rice paddies on both sides of the fields, which were probably the early rice he mentioned. Among the green and lush late rice, there were also occasional scattered plots that were mostly leaning to one side or another. Their numbers seemed very limited.</p>
<p>After about two hours of driving, we arrived at Gencheng Gate in Qingpu – known as the East Gate. The bus stopped at the foot of the drawbridge outside Gencheng Gate. The passengers got off one after another, each paying a fare of 350 yuan.</p>
<p>After getting off the bus, I followed the city moat around to North Gate Street, which is Qingpu's bustling downtown area. Large and small shops were lined up one after another. The reporter checked into the "Qingpu Grand Hotel." It was a small room, just enough for a bed. Besides a coffee table and square stool, there was nothing else, but the marked price was higher than similar hotels in Shanghai, requiring 132 yuan, plus a special tax of 20 yuan.</p>
<p>Conditions in the Rural Villages</p>
<p>Qingpu is a rice-producing area, and most of the people rely on farming for a living. Those who live in the rural villages are mostly tenant farmers. In the past, they were mostly able to make ends meet, but in the last year or two, they have suffered the pain of not being able to make a living. The layers of exploitation in between are certainly a major cause, but the lack of self-improvement on the part of the tenant farmers themselves is also a significant factor. Just taking gambling as an example, at the beginning of this spring, when the Zhujiajiao gambling dens had not yet been banned, the general young and strong rushed to them like ducks to water, gambling day and night, neglecting sleep and meals. Those who went bankrupt and those who committed suicide were often heard of. During the slack farming season, there was really nothing to do, so they thought about how to pass the idle time. Thus, mahjong, pai gow, betting on stalls, and all kinds of gambling formed groups everywhere. As for those who smoked opium and white powder (referring to heroin or white flour), they were also not few.</p>
<p>Farmers feel particularly headache about exorbitant taxes and levies. For example, the monthly tax of 3 yuan per mu, regardless of whether it is cultivated or not, is unavoidable. Once the military passes through the territory, the Baodia chief will always accompany them door-to-door to allot 2 or 3 sheng of rice per household. The remaining scattered and trivial items are numerous. The harvest of one mu is limited, and the exploitation from various sources is endless. The farmers really feel out of breath.</p>
<h3>Chairman Wang's Admonitory Speech to Encourage Cadre Corps and Team Cadres of the Ninth Term of the Military Officers Training Corps</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Cadre Corps of the Ninth Term of the Central Army Military Officers Training Corps held a supplementary opening ceremony on the 12th. Deputy Corps Commander Chen presided over the ceremony. Central government officials present included Chief of General Staff Bao, Army Chief Ye, and Navy Chief Ren, as well as Major General Asakai of the Allied Nations, and over 500 students. First, Deputy Corps Commander Chen read Chairman Wang's (concurrently the Corps Commander) admonitory speech, followed by Major General Asakai delivering a speech on behalf of the highest military advisor of the National Government. Deputy Corps Commander Chen then read the precepts for military personnel of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. The ceremony concluded at 11:00 AM.</p>
<p>Chairman Wang's Admonitory Speech</p>
<p>Today, we are holding the opening ceremony for the Cadre Corps of the Ninth Term of the Central Army Military Officers Training Corps. As your Corps Commander, I would like to emphasize a few points for your encouragement. We are now in the decisive phase of the Greater East Asia War, and our military building efforts must be intensified. Military building begins with training, and cadres at all levels are central to the training of troops. The quality of the troops depends entirely on the quality of the cadres. Only with excellent cadres can we train excellent soldiers. Therefore, even in these times of pressing defense and hectic military affairs, you have been selected to come to the Corps for training, so that you can quickly complete the task of military building, assist the Allied nations in ensuring the security of the rear, and strive for the final victory in the Greater East Asia War. The focus of the training should be:</p>
<p>First, emphasize the understanding of national policy. Regarding the understanding of national policy, it is essential that all existing national troops fully recognize the unity of the East Asian peoples, in order to realize Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Pan-Asianism. The fate of East Asian nations is intertwined; they share weal and woe. Therefore, the rise and fall, survival and demise of East Asian nations depend entirely on the victory or defeat of the Greater East Asia War. Victory means co-existence and prosperity, and all East Asian nations will be liberated. Defeat means that when the nest is overturned, no egg will remain intact, and no East Asian people can escape. This sense of sharing joys and sorrows, of living and dying together, is the primary essence of the national army's spiritual education. Only then will the use of military force not go astray and misdirect its...? (Unclear code).</p>
<p>Second, emphasize the strictness of military discipline. On this point, we must ensure that military discipline is strictly observed at all times and in all places, to serve as a model for improving all units. Military discipline is the lifeblood of the army. Even in daily life, in eating and resting, you must cultivate the habit of strict discipline. Only then, with a single command, can you go through fire and water without hesitation. Only when the army cultivates this kind of iron discipline in peacetime can it concentrate its strength on the battlefield to fight the stubborn enemy and strive for the victory in the last five minutes.</p>
<p>Third, emphasize the training of military skills and physical strength. Scientific and technological skills occupy a very important position in modern warfare. While spiritual strength is fundamentally important, it must be supplemented with military skills and physical training to achieve perfection.</p>
<p>Your training period in the Corps is only four months. You must work diligently day and night, not only on spiritual cultivation, but also on studying hard, so that you can gain insight from your studies. In the future, after returning to your posts, you should use what you have learned to educate soldiers and train elite troops to shoulder the responsibility of reviving China and defending East Asia. The country has high expectations for you.</p>

<h3>The Police Bureau's Inspectorate Implements Special Inspections</h3>
<p>Rectifying Police Discipline and Inspecting Branch Bureau Operations</p>
<p>The Police Bureau's Inspectorate of this city, in order to thoroughly rectify police discipline and actively promote matters related to police supervision, in addition to constantly supervising and inspecting the police affairs of various branch bureaus, has also scheduled the first special inspection to be held from the 11th of this month to September. The chief inspectors of each district are instructed to rotate personnel to the branch bureaus under their jurisdiction to inspect internal affairs such as general administration, judicial police defense, and detainees in detention centers, as well as external affairs such as inspecting order at police posts, train stations, wharves, lighting control, and business hours of various industries managed by the police bureau. Detailed information will be reported to the Inspectorate for verification.</p>
<h3>Strictly Prohibiting Extortion by Fire Department Personnel</h3>
<p>The police authorities of this city, in view of recent cases of unscrupulous individuals impersonating the name of the Police Bureau's Fire Department and entering shops and residences to extort money, have issued the following statement to strictly prohibit such activities: [Recently, there have been unscrupulous individuals impersonating personnel of the Shanghai Special City Police Bureau's Fire Department, entering shops and residences without authorization, and extorting money under the pretext of inspecting fire equipment or privately constructed projects (such as mezzanines). This kind of fraudulent behavior not only harasses the general public, but also damages the reputation of this bureau, which is especially abhorrent. The Fire Department of this bureau may dispatch personnel to investigate civilian-installed fire equipment when it deems necessary. As for dangerous situations inside buildings, the Fire Department may also dispatch personnel to investigate after receiving written complaints from citizens and deeming it necessary to pay attention. However, those assigned to this kind of investigation are all officers above the rank of sergeant, all wearing Fire Department uniforms and carrying employee ID cards (with a photo of the individual attached for identification). If these assigned investigation personnel discover substandard fire equipment or dangerous situations, they will report the facts to the Fire Department Director, who will issue a written warning to the homeowner or resident, instructing them to make improvements. Various facilities related to construction (such as mezzanines) fall under the jurisdiction of the Public Works Bureau and are not within the scope of the Fire Department's business. However, if the Fire Department finds a building to be seriously dangerous, it will notify the Public Works Bureau in writing for verification. There is no procedure for directly dispatching personnel to demolish any buildings. The public, being unaware, often misunderstands. In the future, if anyone encounters individuals claiming to be personnel of the Fire Department of this bureau and daring to extort money under false pretenses, the party involved should ask them to produce their employee ID card. If there is no genuine ID card, it is an impersonation and can be reported to the police for detention. If they carry an employee ID card from the Fire Department of this bureau and engage in the aforementioned illegal behavior, do not hesitate to note their name and official position, present the evidence, and report it to the Fire Department Director of this bureau so that appropriate punishment can be given. Furthermore, it has been heard that there are also individuals in this city who impersonate the name of the Fire Department to sell fire extinguishers and other fire protection products. The public, being unaware, often falls for their tricks. The Fire Department never acts as an agent for the sale of fire protection equipment. Even if it is found that something must be installed, the public will be notified in writing to install it according to the law. There is absolutely no procedure for verbally coercing the sale of fire extinguishers. Any citizen who discovers this kind of impersonation of the Fire Department's name to sell fire extinguishers can immediately report it to the Fire Department of this bureau by telephone (telephone number 15183) or report the facts to the nearest police branch bureau for investigation. The director of this bureau sincerely hopes that all citizens will cooperate with this bureau and report any such illegal behavior as much as possible in order to maintain law and order. This is earnestly hoped for.]</p>
<h3>Explosion Occurs on South Huangpi Road Yesterday</h3>
<p>Seven Dead, More Than Ten Seriously Injured</p>
<p>According to the announcement from the Crime Prevention Section of the Judicial Department of the Police Bureau: At around 10:00 AM yesterday (the 12th), an unfortunate explosion occurred near South Huangpi Road (Avenue Bellesort) and Daxing Road (Avenue Lafayette) in this city due to an old iron shop mistakenly receiving dangerous explosive materials. Three people were killed on the spot, and more than ten were seriously injured. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Iron Shop Mistakenly Receives Giant Naval Mine</h3>
<p>At 9:45 AM yesterday, Cao Zhengbao and Xiao Bazi, two Jiangbei people who regularly engage in the buying and selling of used goods, carried a giant iron ball to Yongda Xiang Water and Electricity Used Iron Shop at 522 South Huangpi Road to sell it. The shop owner, Huang Ada, negotiated with them. Because Cao and others asked for too high a price, he offered ten yuan per catty. Cao Zhengbao, seeing that the ball was very large and might have other accessories inside, pried open a small hole from the side and found small black lumps inside. The shop owner suspected it was dynamite and tried to ignite it, but saw no effect. Thereupon, Cao Zhengbao thought the contents were pigment and was greatly excited, willing to open the iron ball and sell it together. So he and Xiao Bazi carried it to the entrance of Tianhe Lane opposite Yongda Xiang and struck the protruding part of the ball with an iron hammer.</p>
<h3>A Loud Noise, Flesh and Blood Flying Everywhere</h3>
<p>Unexpectedly, with a loud noise, it suddenly exploded, with flesh and blood flying everywhere and sulfurous smoke filling the air. After hearing the news, the Taishan Branch Bureau, led by Chief Tang of the Judicial Section and Deputy Chief Goukou, dispatched detectives to investigate. Cang Xianerlang, Deputy Director of the Judicial Department of the Police Headquarters, also rushed to the scene with personnel from the Identification Section to conduct an investigation. The result determined that the iron ball was indeed a giant naval mine with extremely violent explosive power. Cao Zhengbao, Xiao Bazi, and a passerby who were killed in the explosion all had their bodies torn apart, a truly tragic sight. The upper half of one of the bodies even flew onto the roof of a nearby three-story building. At the same time, as many as seven or eight people were seriously injured, with blood and flesh scattered all over the ground, almost like a terrifying hell.</p>
<h3>Four More Seriously Injured Die</h3>
<p>The 6th Joint Security Self-Defense Corps bravely dispatched rescue stretcher teams to provide emergency aid and called ambulances to send the nine seriously injured to Nanyang and Guangci Hospitals. As of 6:00 PM, four more of the seriously injured had died. It was later determined that when the naval mine exploded, the affected area was more than fifty meters wide, and the explosive force was extremely great. At that time, the wing room at 53 Tianhe Lane happened to be within the explosion force circle, causing the outer wall to be damaged and showing signs of collapse. In addition to investigating the source of the naval mine, the Crime Prevention Section is also warning citizens that they should take this as a lesson. In the future, when picking up or discovering any ownerless dangerous items, weapons, or firearms, they should immediately report it to the nearest police station and must not privately transfer them to prevent the occurrence of such unfortunate incidents that endanger life and public safety.</p>
<h3>Anniversary Commemoration Held for Mussolini's Escape</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 12th) marked the anniversary of the escape of Mussolini, Head of State of the Italian Social Republic.

After the flag-raising ceremony was held at 10:00 AM, the Axis representatives toasted each other in a simple and solemn victory ceremony, which ended at 11:00 AM.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry Explains Wartime Special Price Regulations</h3>
<p>Agreed Prices Should Be Filed with Government Offices</p>
<p>The New Leaf Factory Industry Association of this city previously inquired about whether Article 15 of the Temporary Wartime Price Control Regulations required them to submit a request for approval after the prices were agreed upon by the association. The inquiry was submitted to the Ministry of Industry through the City Chamber of Commerce. It is now known that the ministry has replied that the agreed prices referred to in Article 15 of the Temporary Wartime Price Control Regulations should be reported to the competent government agency for record on one hand and the members should be urged to comply on the other hand. In addition to notifying the provincial governments for reference and ordering the economic bureaus of Beijing and Shanghai, the parties concerned are hereby notified.</p>
