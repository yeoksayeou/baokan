<p>社評</p>
<h3>被炸區受災人民救濟運動</h3>
<p>自從湖南會戰發動，日軍佔領長沙衡陽以後，敵美駐渝空軍，益發暴軍情急焦燥的狂態。據各方面的消息，駐渝美空軍對於和平區內濫施轟炸，尤以漢口，長沙，衡陽各地，距離較近，轟炸頻繁。且其轟炸目標，並非對於軍事要點，而漫無目標，濫施轟炸，以致無　人民的生命財產遭受損害，尤以平民因而顚沛流離，妻離子散，最為悽慘。</p>
<p>我們對於無辜受災的同胞，本於「惻隱之心，人皆有之」的同情心，不能坐視，應籌救濟之道。其次，就政府立塲言，和平區內人民受災應寄以最大的關心。而長沙衡陽的人民，方相率來歸，尤須撫輯流亡，以示政府愛民之意，同時，為爭取民心，使重慶統治下的人民，瞭解和平區內政府愛民的眞切，此在政治上的意義更為重要。因此，對於民間發起的救濟運動，自應盡贊助之力。</p>
<p>基於王述動機，我們主張發起救濟被炸受災平民　動，組織救濟會，策動幕款救濟工作，由民間領袖推動，社會人士出錢出力，共同響應促成其事。至於進行步騾，我們，率先建議數事如次：</p>
<p>即日由慈善社團或民間領袖自動發起，典同討論，組織籌備會，推定素孚衆望的民間領袖擔任一切職務，然後決定推進辦法。民間領袖對於慈善公益向極熱心，自亦義不容辭，樂予接受。</p>
<p>輿論界應盡力鼓吹，引起民間同情，出力出錢，對於鉅額捐款在若干以上者，由政府　揚。必要時組織勸募隊，分頭勸導，以宏成效。</p>
<p>由銀錢業公會指定若干銀行錢莊代收捐款。捐款報告在報端發表，以資微信。捐款保管另設委員會保管，財政絕對公開。</p>
<p>現屆秋初，轉瞬深秋，氣候漸寒，災民最需要者為衣食兩項，當此運輸困難之時，食糧一項，以當地取給為原則，匯款前往受災地區，在當地購買食品發放。譬如長沙衡陽均居湖南產米之中心，就地採辦更無問題。衣服一項，可能時亦以就地採辦為主，否則祗有與棉統會商量，配給普通布疋及棉花，以原料或製成衣服運往。</p>
<p>如匯款往受災區域，在當地購取救濟物品者，請由當地民間領袖與政府協助辦理，木市救濟會另行派遺幹員前往接洽，以期盡利。如在本市購備物品運往施放者，對於遝輸問題，極關重要，尤須盟邦當局之充分協助。</p>
<p>此次盟邦當局發動豫湘戰役，目標在於摧毀敵美駐渝勢力，解除大東亞戰爭之障碍，因此對於戰區人民並無敵意，屢次聲明，軍行之處，保留元氣，愛護人民。對於駐渝美空軍之濫炸，表示憤慨。如本市發起被炸區受災人民救濟運動時，深信必能竭力協贊，這是我們最後所期望的。</p>

<h3>司法獨立應注意　經費人才並重　司法院溫院長談話</h3>
<p>司法院院長溫宗堯氏近對於司法問題發表意見如次：「司法良　，和人民向背，有密切關係。人民的生命，身體自由，財產名譽，皆付托於司法。司法良，人民權利得其保障，自然向順；司法不良，人民權利失其保障，自然背叛；所以自從法儒孟德斯鳩倡立法司法行政三權分立之學說以來，文明各國之司法，沒有不獨立的。國父孫先生，創立五權憲法，不過於立法司法行政之外，加以監察考試二權，而生主張司法獨立，仍無二致。</p>
<p>我國司法，本來設有實官，如唐虞之士，周之司寇，漢之廷尉等是。但因系統不明，權限不淸，形式精神，皆難謂為獨立。前情行使司法權者，屬於行政官，其法獨立更遙遠了。迨後籌備立憲，於宣統二年，在各省會各商埠，設各級審檢廳，將司法和行政劃開，纔樹獨立之萬聲。民國　造，迄今三十餘年，雖陸續添設法院多處，然國難頻仍，承平莫睹，司法也大受影　，不但沒有獨立，幷且每况愈下。現承盟邦日本協力，幸得廢除不平等條約，撤廢治外法權，司法應及時切實改革，纔足以酬明邦的善意，言之令人慚愧恐耀。</p>
<p>司法要得到獨立，亟規注意兩事：第一是經費，我國以前司法經費，不由中央負担，而由地方負担，所以各省行政長官，對於高等審檢長官，儼然以長官自居，每年司法預算，動被削减，就是預算已定，亦必折扣拖欠，不肯如數如期發給的。對於訴訟案件，則肆行干涉，高等審檢等官，祗得仰承鼻息，委曲求全。國府還都，政府纔力矯此弊，把司法經費，改由國庫支出，這是改良司法一大轉機。然一國之要政，興辦甚多，而一國之財源，羅掘將盡，所分配於司法者，仍是杯水車薪，無濟於事。加以物價上騰，漫無止境，法官平亭訟獄，听夕不遑，環顧家人啼飢號寒，有引援者，遷地為良，無引援者，度日如年，不肖之流，則操守頓變，名譽罔顧，貪贓枉法，顚倒是非，似此司法，還能獨立嗎？第二件是人才，徒法不能以自行，古訓昭著，而才難之嘆，雖在盛世，亦不能免，況全面和平，尙未實現如今日者乎。考試院於庚辰　午兩年，曾舉行高等考試兩次，先後錄取法官，僅二十餘人。司法行政部，所辦法官訓練所，迭年司法官班畢業者，為數亦屬廖廖，各級法院檢察署，過有缺出，每苦無相當人員補充，應行合議審判案件，竟因推事不足法定人數，許久不能開庭。訟獄積壓，人民受累，豈能盡屬咎於法官廢弛職務嗎？又老成法官，退職者甚多，一般少年新進，驟膺推檢電任，失所領導，危險更可憂盧。所以在今日言司法人才和司法經費，是同樣重要，如果這兩件重要的辦不到，則司法獨立，終成幻想的。</p>
<h3>江浦道上</h3>
<p>— 閔賢</p>
<p>南京短簡　記者連日在首都郊外各農村考察，對於各村實際情形已見輪廓，邃渡江直入江浦縣境，該縣與南京雖僅一江之隔，而情况大不相問。</p>
<p>四爺囂張　離浦口車站，迤邐入高麗鄉時，即發現許多不自然現象，並有靑年數人對記者注意，詢以何來，原來該鄉雖距現在江浦縣署所在地之南門鎭不過二十餘里，，實為四爺盤踞之地，（鄕民稱新四軍為四爺）一再發生困難，僥倖未受意外。</p>
<p>特殊勢力　旋折入北城鄉及汶河鄉，而所見所聞又不同了，原來此兩鄉鎭另有一特殊勢力，　所謂大隊長李挺甫者，有槍百餘　　，有衆數百人，專門打家刦舍，不受任何方面節制　其大隊長雖聞爲渝方所派，但其所做工作，亦並不有利渝方，總之亂七八糟而已。記者以施送　　姿態，在此兩鄉中逗留數小時，農村情形表面上與首都近郊不相上下，內在的困苦則不堪言，總之，治安若不能確保，根本談不到農村建設。</p>
<p>亁凈之土　折入南門鎭，胸襟一暢，該鎭現為江浦縣署所在地，有居民一千一百二十戶，萬餘人，與隣鎭東門鎭同為江浦縣之干凈土，記者為調查農村情形，仍到鎭外與多數農民作個別談話，大多因治安不能確保，人心惶悚不安，兼以收成欠住，高利貸盛行，農民大都呻吟困古之中。</p>
<p>不知增產　記者復經多次詢間農民，政府年來重視農業增產並設立機構，策進其事，有所感動否？却完全茫然不知。嗣往各有關機關，如鄉保鎭等公所，層層詢問，幾均不感興趣，有稱在報上看見過的，有稱曾經接到一二件公文關於增產的，總而言之，毫未引起作用而巳。由是可知此項建國大業，若僅靠設立多數機構，訂立計書，大發　論，而不深入底層，實難收效也。</p>

<h3>芬總理向國會　演辭內容</h3>
<p>芬京四日中央社電海釋懷社訊：芬蘭總理海克齊爾二日對國會討論與蘇聯恢復邦交時演說稱，因最近軍事及政治局勢之重大變遷，芬政府於愼重考慮之下，已於八月二十五日對蘇駐瑞典公使館表達芬政府之誠意，希望蘇英美協商之結果，業已同意於下列條欵，即要求芬蘭立即對德絕交，並要求德軍應於二星期內由芬蘭境內撤退，一俟上列條件履行後，蘇聯凖備接待芬蘭在莫斯科之特使團，以討論停戰及和平條件。芬當局業已考慮對蘇進行協調之步驟，國會當即同意此政策，並對政府投信任票。關於對德關系，因時勢之轉移，自應作此決定，前任總理與德所訂之協約，並未經國會通過，在國家法案上並不發生合法之價鑪，故此類對德協定，於總揆更易後，並不復繼續發生連繫。總理最後警吿國人，謂未來之禍患仍難逆料，並促國人應對孟納與上將之政府並國會予以擁護。</p>

<p>在目前賭國家興亡的決戰時期下，為戰爭指導之中心者，自是陸海軍常局，在現在的總力戰時期，為其原動力者是武力戰，而與此有密切關係的外交戰，經濟戰，思想戰應活潑地展開，但其各自所推進的目標，乃在使武力戰發揮最大機能。使達到最後的光榮勝利。今戰塲即將波及本土，防衛國土的責務，愈趨重大。關於用兵作戰，專屬統帥部掌管，但日本政治情勢與行政機構，雖在一般行政方面，也直接間接對陸海軍當局負有重大責務。這就是日本陸海軍當局在戰爭指導上握有決定關鍵的緣</p>
<p>但近代戰的狀態，「以陸海軍力始，以國民力終，早已無限界了。軍與國民的一體化」被強烈地要求着，尤以現在慘烈的決戰戰局，無戰場與後方的分別，而傾所有的國力於戰爭。從這觀點而言，在戰爭指導之中心的陸海軍當局，統帥與國務的密切化亦是絕對重要的。又陸海軍當局融洽合作，使戰爭指導的陣綫有磐石之固。以上的二大課題，不能不說且戰爭指導上最大的目標。　　　統帥與國務的調整</p>
<p>運籌帷幄的最高機關大本營，自中國事變以來設置迄今，屢次的用兵作戰，均由大本營籌劃。</p>
<p>但現在的大東亞戰爭的狀態，與日俄戰爭中，以三國干涉後臥薪嘗胆十年間所蓄積起來的軍備而戰的情形不同，為繼續巨大的消耗戰，不能不有巨額的軍需生產作為後力的補給以呼應第一綫果敢的作戰。且由於統帥的方向與範圍，勢必舉一切國力為戰力，而另一方面，用兵作戰的規模與範圍，也自然由戰力的限界來決定。於是，統帥與國務間相亙依存的傾向，限着戰爭的長期化，激烈化而愈見顯著，現在統帥與國務的密切化，正極力被提倡着。</p>
<p>上次設立的最高戰爭指導會議，自將適應這時勢的要求，且以前大本營與政府的聯絡會議，雖獲得極大成果，但並未到達政戰兩略一致的最高目標，此次的最高戰爭指導會議，提</p>
<p>日本强化戰爭指導出戰爭指導的根本方策之策定，與政戰兩略的吻合調整。從此點看來、從「聯絡」到「不可分的密切化」，顯然是大飛躍的措置。</p>
<p>那麼，指導會議大本營的關係應如何理解呢，即用兵作戰的最高統帥，祇為大本營的輔弼，不容別的任何機關置喙。但從最近迅速進展的戰况之推移看來，今後作戰用兵上更基本的要求，將中統帥部方面提出。一方面為滿足這耍求，國務上必須可能的講求戰力的國力化，這裏，在指導會議上吻合調整政戰兩略，更審定戰力及其他諸條件，而策定戰爭指導的根本方針。所謂戰爭指導的根本方針，可作包括統帥與國務之廣養的戰路方針解。據此，則指導會議與大本營的關係，在法律上雖未規定，但在指導會議中決定的大綱，在統帥部亦不能不加以考慮。</p>
<p>但這關係有待於指導會議的運營，故惟有賴構成陣容之相互的信賴與協力所造成的堅固結合，始能完美無缺。適時適切的强力的戰爭指導之展開，實為國民所同致期待者。</p>
<p>陸海軍的密切化</p>
<p>陸海軍之融洽無間的密切化，乃構成戰爭指導上所不可或缺者。大東亞戰爭勃發以來，業已二年九月，這歷史上空前的大戰中，以數世紀未制霸世界的敵英美為對手，而與之交戰的最大的原動力，實為毫無閒隙的陸海軍之協力，今亦無須再事强調了。</p>
<p>陸海二軍在第一綫上，在大東亞戰塲的各地基於戰友愛而協力呼應的事例，不勝枚舉。尤其在太平洋戰錢上，陸海軍的作戰，呈不可分的密切關係。但今後作戰的要求，不祇在用兵作戰方面，即在國務上也希望陸海軍的密切化，此則期待於報道會議者極大。</p>
<p>一般行政，尤以軍需生產行政，縱在軍需省設置後，因有陸·海·軍需省的介在，依然複雜紛歧，其結果，定貨調整，工廠管理，尙未可謂為充分，為擴充軍需生產的原因，此為不可否認的事實。</p>
<p>今後這要求愈為增大，且因戰况的進展，南方軍需物資的運輸，或許更見困難，加以用空襲本土以减低我軍需生產的敵方企圖，雖不過是游擊式的，但今後其規模與次數自將增加。雖處於這種事態下，亦不能不確實維持軍需生產的昻揚，因此希望速下英斷，使陸·海·軍需各省，尤其是陸海軍當局眞正的密切化，實為增大軍需生產的最大要訣。上次閣議中杉山睦相。米內海相曾宜稱：</p>
<p>「陸海軍際此激烈的戰局，實質上打成一片向完遂戰爭邁進。」</p>
<p>可見今後陸海軍當局在各方面將更趨協力，而為國民所期望者。</p>
<p>此外，為發揮軍需物資動員之極度的機動性，最近曾提出作戰與生產行政之密切一體的結合，與軍民船隻之合理的使用之希望。其他諸問題，一待統帥與國務的調整，陸海軍的更進一步協調以後，自能解決。</p>
<p>現在陸海軍的最高首腦陣容，由於上次刷新陣容後，由東條。島田大將的軍令。軍政。一頭制復返於杉山陸相，梅津參謀總長，米內海相，及川軍令部總長的二頭制。德望均孚的四將領之諧洽，實為强力推進戰爭指導的原動力，而為一億國民寄以完全信賴者。（翔：譯自八月十七日朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>大東亞各民族　已奮起自覺　松平部長發表談話</h3>
<p>東亞民族自覺巨潮</p>
<p>盟邦日本大使館上海事務所主持之定例報道常會，於昨（四）日下午三時假南京路外　華懋飯店八樓舉行，即席由松平情報部長發表談話，調大東亞諸民族之自覺，已普遍從英美　制下　起，英美兩國，因此感受重大威脅。茲分誌各要點如次：松平部長首謂：大東亞戰爭發生以來，東亞諸民族已激起自覺巨潮，英美已感受最大威脅，日前日政府情報部井口第三部長，亦對此發表談話綦詳，並指出美國商紳雜誌六月號刋載之英倫密爾斯所著之論文。其內容稱，在嚴洲之日軍，已爲亞洲人民之先驅，美人應加以認識。同時漢又述，不但對於大東亞新崛起之緬甸，菲律賓等獨立國予以認識，對爪哇，馬來之新的政治組織，亦應加以認識。舉凡歐美各國，向排除大東亞諸民族移民，當今此項問題之不能解決，太平洋和平亦未能解決，即如開羅會議主張以武力維持和平以外，毫無其他辦法，此次戰爭，對英美本身，乃爲失　，易善之，英美因對大東亞民族之自覺問題，未有一理想的良好辦法，則此次戰爭，彼等終必失敗無疑。同時又指出每日簡報於八月三十日所載之英名評論家康地特斯所著論文內容，批評英美議院議員對印度發生革命，深認危險，康說明美國黑人問題，較印之獨立更爲深刻，今後如不給有色人種均等地位及機會，則此次戰爭，英美將受失敗之命運，蓋有色人種如今已　起自覺，再不願忍受白色人種之壓迫，白種人所具認之劣等觀感，毫無根據，　積極認識大東亞諸民之自覺。</p>
<p>英美感受重大危機</p>
<p>松平部長繼謂今：英美已感受此項危機，已認識大東亞戰爭爲亞洲革命運動，影響所及，北方自滿洲經中華民國，南方有泰國，緬甸，匪律濱，再有爪吐，蘇門答臘，西裏伯，波羅洲，馬來，安南等各民族，亦同受此項影響，各地有爲之青少年自覺奮起，爲自己民族之發展，以完成自主獨立，甘願流血流汗，犧牲奮鬥。故此項影響，不便遍及大東亞各地，又展開印度獨立運動，自江特拉　斯所率領之印國民軍之活動外，從而進一步刺激國教民族之自覺。最近以埃及國家爲中心，舉行泛阿拉伯會談，在阿裏山召開，　　阿拉伯民族聯合一致之空氣，易成反英氣象。本年七月間，敘利亞方面有英國公使被阿拉伯人暗殺，可資證明阿人之奮起自覺。故大東亞民族自覺，已普遍影響於英美壓制下之各民族，並逐漸促成英美之早日覺悟。</p>

<h3>紗布收賣之回顧與展望</h3>
<p>— 蒔惠辰</p>
<p>政府收買紗布，於茲適足一年，筆者爲織布廠從業員之一，僅就親歷實踐，舉其大要於左：收買明令，於去年八月十日公佈，限九月六日截止，全市工席論雲：「爲懲治國積，消減投機，抑平物價，安定民生起見，排除萬難，斷然出此。」：時至今日，其未克收預期效果，固不待言，鍛工商業者，　體政府苦心，曾無絲毫尤怨，人民之協力政府施策，忠貞誠　，於此可見。</p>
<p>回顧過雲一年，工廠間肆之與紗布有關者，莫不陷於停頓，無日不在盼望早日實現有　統之配給之中，不謂事實上非惟配給無期，而第一期應付之價金，大多數猶未結發，從使工商業者停工職業，坐守經年，尤其以棉紗布爲原料之工廠，工人不能盡散，職員不能盡數，繼續開工既無原料，改營他業，又乏資金，上爲政府所不諒，下受員工之責難，加以生活日商，負擔益重，終日徬徨，無可爲計，此中苦況，　局外人所能窺知，更無論政府之救濟矣。</p>
<p>以常理衡之，本市工商業者，既以協力政府施策而遭受如許痛苦，政府自應於不背國策之範　內，　　予以救助，可得而言者，約有烽端：</p>
<p>一不論已否檢收，第一期價金迅予結發（未檢收者，當然加緊檢收，願知其遲緩之咎，不在商民。）以昭大信。</p>
<p>二第二期價金提前發給，以資管運。</p>
<p>三定期存單實際上應准十足抵押。（過雲似嫌有名無實。）</p>

<h3>Relief Movement for Victims of Bombings</h3>
<p>Since the start of the Hunan campaign and the Japanese army's occupation of Changsha and Hengyang, the U.S. air force stationed in Chongqing has increasingly displayed frantic and desperate behavior. According to various sources, the U.S. air force stationed in Chongqing has been indiscriminately bombing peaceful areas, especially the areas around Hankou, Changsha, and Hengyang, which are relatively close and frequently bombed. Moreover, their bombing targets are not military strongholds, but indiscriminate bombing without a clear target, resulting in damage to the lives and property of innocent people. In particular, civilians have been displaced and families have been torn apart, which is extremely tragic.</p>
<p>Based on the compassion that "everyone possesses," we cannot stand idly by and must find ways to provide relief to our compatriots who have been innocently affected. Secondly, from the government's standpoint, the people in the peaceful areas who have been affected should be given the utmost care. The people of Changsha and Hengyang are just now coming over in droves, and it is especially necessary to appease the refugees to show the government's love for the people. At the same time, in order to win over public support and let the people under Chongqing's rule understand the genuine love of the government within the peaceful areas, this is even more important politically. Therefore, we should do our best to support the relief movement initiated by the people.</p>
<p>Based on the above motives, we advocate initiating a movement to provide relief to civilians affected by the bombings, organizing a relief association, planning fundraising and relief work, promoting it through civic leaders, and encouraging people from all walks of life to contribute money and effort to jointly promote its success. As for the steps to be taken, we suggest the following:</p>
<p>Charitable organizations or civic leaders should immediately take the initiative to discuss and organize a preparatory committee, appoint respected civic leaders to all positions, and then decide on the way forward. Civic leaders are usually enthusiastic about charitable and public welfare causes, and they will certainly not shirk their responsibilities and will be happy to accept.</p>
<p>The media should do their best to promote the movement, arouse public sympathy, and encourage people to contribute money and effort. For large donations exceeding a certain amount, the government should commend them. If necessary, organize fundraising teams to solicit donations separately to maximize the effect.</p>
<p>The banking and money industry association should designate several banks and money houses to collect donations. Donation reports should be published in newspapers to enhance credibility. A separate committee should be established to manage the donations, and the finances should be absolutely transparent.</p>
<p>It is currently early autumn, and deep autumn will arrive in the blink of an eye. The weather is getting colder, and the two things that disaster victims need most are food and clothing. At this time of transportation difficulties, the principle for food should be to obtain it locally, remit funds to the affected areas, and purchase and distribute food locally. For example, Changsha and Hengyang are both located in the rice-producing center of Hunan, so there is no problem in procuring it locally. In terms of clothing, local procurement should also be the main focus if possible. Otherwise, we can only discuss with the Cotton Control Association to allocate ordinary cloth and cotton, and transport the raw materials or finished clothes to the affected areas.</p>
<p>If funds are remitted to the disaster-stricken areas to purchase relief supplies locally, please ask the local civic leaders and the government to assist in the process. The relief association in this city will send staff members to make contact in order to maximize efficiency. If goods are purchased and prepared in this city for transportation and distribution, the transportation problem is extremely important, and full assistance from the Allied authorities is particularly necessary.</p>
<p>The Allied authorities launched the Henan-Hunan campaign with the goal of destroying the enemy's U.S. forces stationed in Chongqing and removing obstacles to the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, they have no hostility towards the people in the war zone and have repeatedly stated that they will preserve vitality and protect the people wherever the army goes, and have expressed indignation at the indiscriminate bombing by the U.S. air force stationed in Chongqing. If this city launches a relief movement for the victims of the bombings, we firmly believe that they will do their best to cooperate, which is our final expectation.</p>
<h3>Japan Establishes Cooperation System - Government Officials Hold Weekly Meetings - Demobilized Soldiers Mobilized to Organize Defense Force</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese government officially announced a government official system on the 1st, establishing a system of cooperation between the government and the people. It was also decided that from now on, government official meetings will be held every Wednesday at 10:00 AM at the Prime Minister's residence. Vice ministers and participating officials from various ministries will attend to discuss current issues and exchange opinions with the Chief Cabinet Secretary.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - In order to enhance the overall system of its members over the past 40 years since its founding and complete the consistent organization for defending the homeland, the Japanese Veterans Association President Inoue invited the heads of the national joint branches to hold a meeting at the association on August 17. On September 1, 2, and 3, the military headquarters in various regions summoned the heads of the branches and joint sub-branches under their jurisdiction to instruct them on ways to strengthen mobilization and ideological guidance. Preparations are scheduled to be completed by the 10th, and on the dawn of the 11th, all members across the country will be mobilized to hold a ceremony to establish a defense force, so the Japanese civil defense organization will be more consolidated.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting Continues on the Coast of Dien Bien Phu - Infighting in Anglo-American Forces in Southeast Asia</h3>
<p>Central Pacific Front, 4th (Central News Agency) - On September 1, a unit of American troops invaded the coast of Nasdi, 20 kilometers south of Dien Bien Phu Island. Japanese and American forces are currently continuing to engage in fierce fighting in that area.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from London, the British "Tribune" magazine on the 2nd revealed the infighting between Mountbatten and Stilwell within the anti-Axis forces in Southeast Asia: "Under Mountbatten, Deputy Commander Stilwell, who represents the American forces fighting in the East Asia Theater, often disagrees with Mountbatten on the issue of China. Although the anti-Axis forces in Southeast Asia have repeatedly held headquarters meetings in the past six months, Stilwell has only attended twice. The British Indian Army even criticized him as a "verbal fighter." The United States has repeatedly attacked the British forces in India and Burma as incompetent, but what has Stilwell contributed? Although he boasted about opening the Ledo Road, his actual performance was that he used a large army of 12,000 to attack a very small number of Japanese troops in northern Burma, spending two months without achieving any results. Only when the Chongqing army came to the rescue was he able to advance. His own ability can be seen."</p>
<h3>French Ambassador to Japan Visits Foreign Minister Shigemitsu</h3>

Finally, the assembly passed the following resolutions: Burmese people must unite to defeat the long-time enemies, Britain and the United States, and achieve victory in the Fourth War. Burmese people must overcome all difficulties and strive to build Greater East Asia and Burma.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ambassador to Thailand, Mr. Yamamoto, Takes Office</h3>

<h3>Increased Purchase Price of Agricultural Products</h3>
<p>Manchuria, 4th (Central News Agency) - The All-Manchuria Concordia Association held its second day (3rd) meeting, attended by Minister of Agriculture Huang Fujun, who explained this year's cultivation and purchase countermeasures and announced: "The purchase price of soybeans and other agricultural products will be increased.

<h3>Attention Should Be Paid to Judicial Independence - Both Funding and Talent Are Important - Talk by President Wen of the Judicial Yuan</h3>
<p>Wen Zongyao, President of the Judicial Yuan, recently expressed the following views on judicial issues: "The quality of the judiciary is closely related to the support of the people. The people's lives, bodily freedom, property, and reputation are all entrusted to the judiciary. If the judiciary is good, the people's rights will be protected, and they will naturally be supportive. If the judiciary is bad, the people's rights will be lost, and they will naturally be betrayed. Therefore, since the French jurist Montesquieu advocated the theory of the separation of legislative, judicial, and executive powers, the judiciary of all civilized countries has been independent. Sun Yat-sen, the Founding Father, created the Five-Power Constitution, but in addition to the legislative, judicial, and executive powers, he added the powers of supervision and examination, and his advocacy of judicial independence remains unchanged.</p>
<p>Our country's judiciary originally had real officials, such as the scholar-officials of the Tang and Yu dynasties, the Secretary of Justice of the Zhou dynasty, and the Court Commandant of the Han dynasty. However, due to the lack of a clear system and unclear authority, it was difficult to say that the form and spirit were independent. In the past, those who exercised judicial power belonged to administrative officials, and their independence was even more remote. It was not until the preparation for constitutionalism, in the second year of Xuantong, that courts and procuratorates at all levels were established in the provincial capitals and commercial ports, separating the judiciary from the executive, that the foundation for independence was laid. Since the founding of the Republic of China more than 30 years ago, although many courts have been added successively, the country has suffered frequent disasters, and peace has not been seen. The judiciary has also been greatly affected, not only has it not been independent, but it has also deteriorated. Now, with the cooperation of our ally Japan, we are fortunate to have abolished the unequal treaties and revoked extraterritoriality. The judiciary should be thoroughly reformed in a timely manner in order to repay the goodwill of our ally. It is shameful and frightening to say this.</p>
<p>If the judiciary is to be independent, we must pay attention to two things: first, funding. In the past, our country's judicial funding was not borne by the central government, but by the local governments, so the administrative heads of the provinces regarded the senior judges and procurators as their subordinates. The annual judicial budget was often cut, and even if the budget was fixed, it would be discounted and delayed, and they would not be willing to issue it in full and on time. They interfered in litigation cases at will, and senior judges and procurators had to rely on their superiors and seek perfection in a roundabout way. After the return of the National Government to the capital, the government corrected this malpractice and changed the judicial funding to be paid by the national treasury, which was a major turning point in the reform of the judiciary. However, there are many important government affairs to be undertaken in a country, and the country's financial resources are almost exhausted, so what is allocated to the judiciary is still a drop in the bucket and does not solve the problem. In addition, prices are rising endlessly. Judges are busy day and night hearing lawsuits, and when they look around, they see their families crying out in hunger and cold. Those who have support will find better places to work, and those who do not have support will live a difficult life. Unworthy people will change their morals, disregard their reputation, take bribes and pervert the law, and turn right and wrong upside down. Can such a judiciary still be independent? The second thing is talent. The ancient saying is that a mere law cannot be self-enforcing, and the lamentation of the difficulty of finding talent cannot be avoided even in a prosperous age, let alone today when comprehensive peace has not yet been realized. The Examination Yuan held two higher examinations in the years of Gengchen and Wu, and only recruited more than 20 judges. The Judicial Administrative Department has held judicial officer training courses for many years, but the number of graduates is also very small. When vacancies occur in courts and procuratorates at all levels, it is difficult to find suitable personnel to fill them. Cases that should be heard by a collegial panel cannot be opened for a long time because there are not enough judges. Litigation is backlogged and the people are suffering. Can all of this be blamed on the judges' dereliction of duty? In addition, many senior judges have retired, and a general influx of young newcomers have suddenly shouldered the responsibility of judging and prosecuting, losing their leadership, and the danger is even more worrisome. Therefore, in today's world, judicial talent and judicial funding are equally important. If these two important things cannot be done, then judicial independence will remain an illusion."</p>
<h3>On the Road to Jiangpu</h3>
<p>— Min Xian</p>
<p>Short Report from Nanjing - The reporter has been investigating the actual situation in various rural villages in the suburbs of the capital in recent days and has seen an outline of the situation in each village. He then crossed the river and entered the territory of Jiangpu County. Although the county is only separated from Nanjing by a river, the situation is very different.</p>
<p>Fourth Master's Arrogance - After leaving Pukou Station and entering Gaoli Township, many unnatural phenomena were discovered, and several young people paid attention to the reporter and asked where he came from. It turned out that although the township was only more than 20 miles away from Nanmen Town, where the Jiangpu County Office is located, it was actually a place occupied by the Fourth Master (the villagers call the New Fourth Army the Fourth Master). Difficulties occurred repeatedly, but luckily no accidents occurred.</p>
<p>Special Forces - Then, when turning into Beicheng Township and Wenhe Township, what was seen and heard was different. It turned out that there was another special force in these two townships, the so-called Captain Li Tingfu, who had more than 100 guns and hundreds of men, specializing in robbing homes and not subject to any control. Although it was said that the captain was sent by Chongqing, the work he did was not beneficial to Chongqing. In short, it was a mess. The reporter, posing as a benefactor, stayed in these two townships for several hours. The rural situation on the surface was similar to that of the suburbs of the capital, but the internal hardships were unspeakable. In short, without security, rural construction is out of the question.</p>
<p>Clean Land - When entering Nanmen Town, the heart was relieved. The town is now the location of the Jiangpu County Office and has 1,120 households and more than 10,000 people. Together with the neighboring Dongmen Town, it is the clean land of Jiangpu County. In order to investigate the rural situation, the reporter still went outside the town and had individual conversations with most of the farmers. Most of them were disturbed and uneasy because security could not be ensured, and the harvest was not good, and usury was rampant. Most of the farmers were groaning in hardship.</p>
<p>Unaware of Increased Production - The reporter repeatedly asked the farmers whether they were touched by the government's emphasis on agricultural production and the establishment of institutions to promote it in recent years. They were completely unaware. When asked at various relevant institutions, such as township, bao, and town offices, the response was generally uninterested. Some said they had seen it in the newspaper, and some said they had received one or two official documents about increasing production. In short, it had no effect at all. From this, it can be seen that if this great cause of national construction relies only on establishing many institutions, formulating plans, and issuing high-sounding theories, without going deep into the bottom, it will be difficult to achieve results.</p>

This year, because the Japanese army began the mainland operation, the 12th Central Committee Plenary Session was hastily convened in late May to discuss countermeasures. After the battles in Henan and Hunan came to an end, the mainland operation has plunged the Chongqing side into crisis, so the Chongqing government is holding the Political Council meeting to report on various situations. It is estimated that 240 representatives from provinces, cities, and various sectors will attend the meeting.</p>

<p>Stockholm, 4th (Central News Agency) - Finnish Prime Minister Hackzell announced in a broadcast on the evening of the 2nd that the Finnish government has requested the withdrawal of German troops from its territory. The German government has acknowledged this request. The above measures are the first step for Finland to restore peace and will lead to peace negotiations with the Soviet Union. The content of the Soviet armistice treaty with Finland is still unclear, but it is only known that the Soviet Union is not demanding unconditional surrender from Finland.</p>
<h3>Contents of Finnish Prime Minister's Address to Parliament</h3>
<p>Helsinki, 4th (Central News Agency) - A Reuters report states: Finnish Prime Minister Hackzell, in a speech to Parliament on the 2nd regarding the restoration of relations with the Soviet Union, stated that, due to the significant changes in the recent military and political situation, the Finnish government, after careful consideration, expressed its sincerity to the Soviet Embassy in Sweden on August 25, hoping that the negotiations between the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States would result in an agreement on the following terms: that Finland immediately sever ties with Germany and that German troops should withdraw from Finnish territory within two weeks. Once the above conditions are met, the Soviet Union is prepared to receive a Finnish envoy in Moscow to discuss armistice and peace terms. The Finnish authorities have considered the steps to coordinate with the Soviet Union, and Parliament immediately agreed to this policy and gave the government a vote of confidence. Regarding relations with Germany, this decision should be made due to the changing circumstances. The agreement signed by the previous Prime Minister with Germany was not approved by Parliament and does not have legal value under national law. Therefore, such agreements with Germany no longer continue to have a binding effect after a change of government. The Prime Minister finally warned the people that future misfortunes are still unpredictable and urged them to support the government and Parliament of Mannerheim and Åkerman.</p>

Chongqing intends to improve its unsatisfactory relations with the Soviet Union through this action. Relations between Chongqing and the Soviet Union will become closer after Sheng Shicai's resignation, but this may lead to the biggest event in East Asia's future.</p>
<p>In the current decisive battle period where the fate of the nation is at stake, the center of war guidance is naturally the standing bureaus of the army and navy. In the current era of total war, the driving force is military force. Diplomatic warfare, economic warfare, and ideological warfare, which are closely related to this, should be vigorously deployed. However, the goals of each of these are to maximize the function of military force and achieve final glorious victory. Now that the battlefield is about to spread to the homeland, the responsibility of defending the country is becoming increasingly important. Matters regarding the use of troops and operations are exclusively under the control of the Supreme Command. However, Japan's political situation and administrative structure, even in general administration, bear a significant responsibility, directly or indirectly, to the army and navy authorities. This is why the Japanese army and navy authorities hold the decisive key in war guidance.</p>
<p>However, the state of modern warfare, "beginning with the army and navy, ending with the national strength, is already limitless. The integration of the military and the people" is strongly demanded. Especially in the current fierce decisive battle situation, there is no distinction between the battlefield and the rear, and all national strength is devoted to the war. From this point of view, the close connection between the commander and the state is absolutely crucial for the army and navy authorities at the center of war guidance. Furthermore, the harmonious cooperation of the army and navy authorities ensures the invulnerability of the war guidance line. The above two major issues must be said to be the biggest goals in war guidance. Coordination between Command and State Affairs</p>
<p>The Imperial General Headquarters, the supreme organ for planning strategy, has been established since the China Incident. Repeated troop deployments and operations have been planned by the Imperial General Headquarters.</p>
<p>However, the current state of the Greater East Asia War differs from the situation in the Russo-Japanese War, where military preparations accumulated during the ten years of perseverance after the Triple Intervention were used to fight. In order to continue the massive war of attrition, a huge amount of military production is necessary as a rear-force supply to support the bold operations at the front line. Moreover, due to the direction and scope of command, it is inevitable to turn all national strength into combat power. On the other hand, the scale and scope of troop deployments and operations are naturally determined by the limits of combat power. As a result, the interdependent relationship between command and state affairs has become increasingly prominent with the prolongation and intensification of the war. Currently, the close connection between command and state affairs is being strongly promoted.</p>
<p>The Supreme War Guidance Council, established last time, will adapt to the demands of this situation. Although the Liaison Conference between the Imperial General Headquarters and the government has achieved great results, it has not reached the supreme goal of unifying politics and war. The Supreme War Guidance Council this time aims to formulate fundamental policies for strengthening war guidance and to align and coordinate political and military strategies. From this point of view, the shift from "liaison" to "inseparable closeness" is clearly a major leap forward.</p>
<p>So, how should the relationship between the Guidance Council and the Imperial General Headquarters be understood? The supreme command of troop deployments and operations is solely the responsibility of the Imperial General Headquarters, and no other organization is allowed to interfere. However, judging from the recent rapid development of the war situation, more fundamental requirements for operations and troop deployments will be proposed from the Supreme Command. On the one hand, in order to meet these requirements, the state must strive to nationalize combat power as much as possible. Here, the political and military strategies are aligned and coordinated in the Guidance Council, and combat power and other conditions are further reviewed to formulate the fundamental policy of war guidance. The so-called fundamental policy of war guidance can be interpreted as a broad strategic policy encompassing command and state affairs. Accordingly, although the relationship between the Guidance Council and the Imperial General Headquarters is not legally defined, the guidelines decided in the Guidance Council must be considered by the Supreme Command.</p>
<p>However, this relationship depends on the operation of the Guidance Council. Therefore, only a solid combination created by mutual trust and cooperation among the constituent members can be flawless. The timely, appropriate, and powerful deployment of war guidance is what the nation unanimously expects.</p>
<p>Close Coordination between the Army and Navy</p>
<p>The harmonious and close coordination between the army and navy is indispensable for war guidance. It has been two years and nine months since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. The greatest driving force for fighting against the enemy, the United States and Britain, who have not dominated the world for centuries in this unprecedented war in history, is the seamless cooperation between the army and navy. There is no need to emphasize this again.</p>
<p>Countless examples of the army and navy cooperating and responding to each other on the front lines and in various theaters of the Greater East Asia War. Especially in the Pacific theater, the operations of the army and navy are inextricably linked. However, the requirements for future operations are not limited to troop deployments and operations. The close coordination between the army and navy is also desired in state affairs, and great expectations are placed on the Reporting Council for this.</p>
<p>General administration, especially military production administration, remains complex and fragmented even after the establishment of the Ministry of Munitions due to the intervention of the Army, Navy, and Ministry of Munitions. As a result, order adjustments and factory management cannot be said to be sufficient, which is an undeniable fact that hinders the expansion of military production.</p>
<p>This demand will continue to increase in the future. Moreover, due to the progress of the war, the transportation of military supplies to the south may become more difficult. In addition, the enemy's attempts to reduce our military production by air raids on the homeland, although only guerrilla-style, will increase in scale and frequency in the future. Even in this situation, it is imperative to maintain the rise of military production. Therefore, it is hoped that a prompt decision will be made to truly strengthen the close coordination between the Army, Navy, and Ministry of Munitions, especially between the Army and Navy authorities, which is the biggest key to increasing military production. In the previous cabinet meeting, Ministers Sugiyama and Yonai stated:</p>
<p>"The Army and Navy, in this fierce battle situation, are essentially fighting together to complete the war."</p>
<p>It can be seen that the Army and Navy authorities will cooperate more in various aspects in the future, which is what the nation expects.</p>
<p>In addition, in order to maximize the mobility of military supplies, the close integration of operations and production administration, and the rational use of military and civilian ships have recently been proposed. Other issues will be resolved after the adjustment of command and state affairs and the further coordination of the army and navy.</p>
<p>The current top leadership of the army and navy, after the recent reorganization, has returned from the one-headed system of Generals Tojo and Shimada in military command and military administration to the two-headed system of Army Minister Sugiyama, Chief of the General Staff Umezu, Navy Minister Yonai, and Chief of the Naval General Staff Oikawa. The harmony of these four respected generals is the driving force for powerfully promoting war guidance, and it is to them that the 100 million people place their complete trust.

<h3>Ministry of Justice Issues Directive: Implement Stringent Discipline, Orders Each Level of Court to Admonish Subordinates Separately</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Justice, in order to rectify legal discipline and enhance the dignity of judicial officials, issues a directive to all subordinate courts and prosecutors' offices, etc., to earnestly admonish each official, strengthen their spirit, and rectify discipline. The Shanghai Local Prosecutor's Office, upon receiving this directive, shall immediately notify each prosecutor accordingly.</p>
<p>Minister Chen Discusses Improving Shanghai's Judicial Administration</p>
<p>Minister of Justice Chen Enpu, who recently came to Shanghai, returned to the capital yesterday and made the following remarks: Since the recovery of the concessions in Shanghai, the courts and prosecutors' offices have received a large number of cases. After arriving in Shanghai, I immediately summoned the heads of the high and local courts to instruct them on everything. It was decided to divide the criminal division of the local court and the investigation division of the local prosecutor's office into several units. The allocation of cases will be based on the police stations that transfer them, and the presiding judges will handle them at any time, slightly alleviating the suffering of the defendants in custody. Currently, the backlog of cases and the number of criminal defendants in detention have been greatly reduced. Furthermore, if the local court and the local prosecutor's office can merge in the future, the handling of cases will definitely be more rapid. The Shanghai Local Prosecutor's Office detention center holds over one thousand inmates, which has led to some criticism. After discussing it in person, I immediately ordered reforms. Inmates with unruly behavior are temporarily sent to the Shanghai Prison for confinement, and efforts are being made to improve the center. The center's expenses and the monthly rent for inmates' food and accommodation reach two million yuan, and we will provide as much funding as possible.</p>
<h3>Thoroughly Clean Up the City, Strictly Investigate and Suppress Smoking and Gambling, Hoping Citizens Will Cherish Themselves and Abstain</h3>
<p>The municipal government is determined to thoroughly eliminate smoking, gambling, and drugs in order to refresh the cityscape of Shanghai. It has successively closed down gambling dens and opium dens in the southern part of the city. However, investigations have revealed that some illegal operators are still active, privately setting up opium dens to serve customers, which is illegal. The police bureau has specially established a smoking and drug investigation unit, which is actively engaged in investigation and suppression work. Opium dens will be wiped out, and private opium smokers will be severely punished according to the law. At the same time, some gamblers have had the audacity to open inns or gather to gamble in secluded alleys and brothels, profiting from skimming the winnings, creating a disguised form of small gambling platforms. Strict investigation and suppression of social security and the cityscape will be carried out. Once discovered, both the owners and gamblers will be severely investigated. Therefore, it is hoped that citizens will truly cherish themselves and abstain from smoking and gambling to avoid breaking the law.</p>
<p>Addiction Treatment Hospitals Welcome Those Who Want to Quit</p>
<p>Because the government is actively implementing a strict anti-smoking policy, addiction treatment hospitals have been widely established in various places. In the Shanghai area, the Ministry of Health has also established the Shanghai Addiction Treatment Hospital at 190 Chezhan Road in the southern part of the city. The hospital was officially established last month and accepts those who smoke opium and take highly addictive drugs for treatment. The hospital has spacious buildings, complete equipment, and specialized doctors. The wards are divided into first, second, and third class, with low fees. Currently, all those admitted are voluntarily seeking treatment. After quitting, the hospital issues a certificate. According to those who have been admitted for addiction treatment, the treatment is good, and the quitting method is new and painless. The first-class wards have one person per room, and the second and third-class wards have two people per room. The admission procedures are very simple. It is hoped that those who are addicted will quickly seek treatment so that they can escape the bitter sea as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Industrial and Commercial Registration: Deadline at the End of the Month</h3>
<p>The Bureau of Economy believes that, since the municipal administration has been unified, a citywide industrial and commercial census must be actively carried out. Since the implementation of the citywide industrial and commercial general registration, various industries have been actively applying for registration at the bureau in recent days. However, many industries are still taking a wait-and-see attitude and have not registered. In order to consider the difficulties of businesses, the bureau has repeatedly extended the registration deadline. However, in order to complete this task, the registration deadline will be at the end of this month and will not be extended again. Those who have not registered after the deadline this month will be punished according to regulations or have their businesses suspended. Those industries related to food and beverages must also apply for registration within January.</p>
<h3>Nationalities of Greater East Asia Have Awakened and Risen: Minister Matsudaira Gives Speech</h3>
<p>A Giant Tide of Self-Awareness Among the Peoples of East Asia</p>
<p>The regular press conference hosted by the Shanghai Office of the Allied Japanese Embassy was held yesterday (4th) at 3:00 PM on the eighth floor of the Cathay Hotel on Nanjing Road. Minister of Information Matsudaira gave a speech, stating that the self-awareness of the peoples of Greater East Asia has universally risen from under Anglo-American oppression, and that the Anglo-American powers are feeling a significant threat as a result. The main points are recorded as follows: Minister Matsudaira first stated: Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the peoples of East Asia have been stirred by a giant tide of self-awareness, and the Anglo-American powers are feeling the greatest threat. The Third Department Chief of the Japanese Government Information Bureau, Inoguchi, also recently gave a detailed speech on this matter and pointed out the article written by British writer Mills published in the June issue of the American Merchant Magazine. The content of the article stated that the Japanese army in Manchuria is the vanguard of the Asian people, and Americans should recognize this. He also stated that, not only should the newly rising independent nations of Burma and the Philippines be recognized, but also the new political organizations of Java and Malaya should be recognized. If the problem of European and American countries excluding the immigration of the peoples of Greater East Asia cannot be solved, the peace of the Pacific cannot be solved. Just like the Cairo Conference, which advocates maintaining peace by force, there is no other way. This war is a misstep for the Anglo-American powers themselves. If the Anglo-American powers do not have an ideal and good solution to the problem of the self-awareness of the peoples of Greater East Asia, they will undoubtedly fail in this war. At the same time, he also pointed out the content of an article written by the famous British commentator Condit, published in the Daily Bulletin on August 30, which criticized British and American parliamentarians for deeply recognizing the danger of the revolution in India. Condit explained that the problem of American blacks is more profound than the independence of India. In the future, if equal status and opportunities are not given to people of color, the Anglo-American powers will be doomed to failure in this war. The peoples of color have now awakened and are no longer willing to endure the oppression of the white race. The inferior views held by the white race have no basis, and they should actively recognize the self-awareness of the peoples of Greater East Asia.</p>
<p>Anglo-American Powers Feel a Significant Crisis</p>
<p>Minister Matsudaira continued by saying that the Anglo-American powers now feel this crisis and recognize that the Greater East Asia War is an Asian revolutionary movement. The impact has spread from Manchuria and the Republic of China in the north to Thailand, Burma, and the Philippines in the south, and then to Java, Sumatra, Celebes, Borneo, Malaya, Annam, and other ethnic groups. Young people everywhere have awakened and risen up, willing to shed blood and sweat and sacrifice to complete their own development and independence. Therefore, this impact has spread throughout Greater East Asia, and the Indian independence movement has been launched. In addition to the activities of the Indian National Army led by Jiang Tela [unclear] This further stimulated the self-awareness of the national religious ethnic groups. Recently, the Pan-Arab talks were held with Egypt as the center, and were held in Alexandria, [unclear] The air of Arab ethnic unity is easily formed into an anti-British atmosphere. In July of this year, the British Minister to Syria was assassinated by Arabs, which can prove the awakening and self-awareness of the Arabs. Therefore, the self-awareness of the ethnic groups of Greater East Asia has universally affected the various ethnic groups under the repression of the Anglo-American powers and is gradually promoting the early awakening of the Anglo-American powers.</p>

<p>Reader's Support for Education News</p>
<h3>Upholding the Decree Forbidding Daoist Rituals and Fulfilling the Heavenly Duty of Saving Students from Dropping Out of School</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the No. 1 Lianbao, Nos. 2 and 3 Bao Offices in the Taishan District raised over 60,000 yuan by saving money from traditional "Daoist rituals" and using it for "educational assistance." The significance is profound, and the good intentions are admirable. The wording of the original letter is also very pertinent, hoping that the practice of holding Daoist rituals throughout the city will cease from now on, and that public funds will be used for good deeds. This truly upholds the decree forbidding Daoist rituals and fulfills the heavenly duty of saving people. What could be better? The original letter stated: "Our Bao" residents used to hold Zhongyuan Daoist rituals. "Yulan" is a transliteration of a Sanskrit term, meaning "saving hungry ghosts who are upside down." But in these times, people are not as well off as "ghosts," and the upside-down situation is even worse than that of "ghosts." Therefore, we are saving the money from the Daoist rituals and using it for your newspaper's educational assistance fund. This can be considered upholding the decree forbidding Daoist rituals and fulfilling the heavenly duty of saving students from dropping out of school. Although the amount is small, it is intended as a token to encourage others.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Educational Assistance Received: Taishan District No. 1 Lianbao, Nos. 2 and 3 Bao Offices: 63,100 yuan (Heming Shoe and Hat Store: 20,000 yuan; Lao Zheng Xing Silver Store: 5,000 yuan; Shi Cheng Gong Ji Silver Store: 4,000 yuan; Zheng Da Educational Supplies, Zheng Da Chang Money Exchange, Zheng Xing Hao, Yi Feng Tai, Ying Yu Shoe and Hat Shop, Shanghai Bank, Jin Cheng Bank, Allied Business Bank: 2,000 yuan each; Cai Hang Sheng, Long Tai Chang Zhao Chang Tobacco Shop, Guang Da Building Factory, Hua Cheng Leather Shoe Shop, Fu Xin, Wu Hua Silver Store: 1,000 yuan each; Wei Zheng Mao Pharmacy, Tao Zheng Ji, Sun Wang Sheng, Chun He Shi, Fu Tai Egg Shop, Gong Da, Ju Yu Guan, Hong Yu Cloth Shop, Zhou Wen Fu, Zhang Qi Gao, Gong Ping Shoe Shop: 500 yuan each; Zhang Fei Ran: 400 yuan; Cai Chang Shou: 300 yuan; Lu Wen Dong, Xu Guo Zheng, Wu Lao Zheng, Zhu Yi Sheng, Le Jia Sheng, Yuan Jing Xiang, Xu Yin Gui, Xia Zhi Li, Zhang Ruo Liang, Hu Song Ting, Wu Xiao Shi, Tang Yun Qing, Zhu He Sheng, Zheng Fa Xiang, Da You Sheng, Da Dong, Jiu He Xiang, Zheng Zheng Guan: 200 yuan each; Tang Rui Zheng, Gao Ru Chang, Sun Ling Zhen, Long Ju, Wang Zheng Yuan, Duan Dong Fang, Wang Shi Fu, Shi Yao Fang, Qing Mei Ju, Chen Er Pin, Yu Zhi Qing, Shun Xiang, Wang Jin Rong: 100 yuan each.</p>

<h3>China Film Company Charity Performance: "Eternal Love" to Benefit Education; Showing at the Grand Theatre on the 8th and 9th</h3>
<p>China Film Company's newly produced film "Eternal Love" will be shown at the Grand Theatre starting on the 8th of this month. This film was personally designed and supervised by Mr. Zhang Shankun. The plot is lively, the structure is novel, and the performance is particularly lavish. The film can be completed in two hours, and it features 26 stars singing a total of 43 famous songs. It can be called a groundbreaking masterpiece in the film world. Movie fans who have not visited a film set can get a panoramic view of the real work under the mercury lights. Those who have not been to a dressing room can see the true faces of the stars and feast their eyes on beauty. The singing stars include the late Ruan Lingyu, as well as Hu Die and Chen Yunshang, who have left the film industry; the famous red stars Li Xianglan and Li Lihua; and the golden voices Zhou Xuan, Bai Hong, and Li Qiuxia. The variety is dazzling, like thousands of reds and purples. The company authorities have generously designated the first two days, the 8th and 9th, as charity performances, and the proceeds from ticket sales will be donated to this newspaper's educational assistance fund, the Xinwen Bao's loan scholarship fund, and the vagrant labor camp expenses. Ticket prices are: upstairs 3,000 yuan, 1,000 yuan, 500 yuan; downstairs 1,000 yuan, 500 yuan, 300 yuan. Both newspapers' distribution offices can also sell tickets.</p>
<h3>Materials Investigation Committee Holds Closing Meeting</h3>
<p>The Materials Investigation Committee has been ordered to dissolve by the Executive Yuan and has been instructed to prepare for closure. So far, the closure matters are mostly ready, but the question of which agency should take over the unfinished matters after the closure is still pending discussion and decision. The committee has specifically scheduled a closing meeting for 3:00 PM this afternoon (the 5th) to discuss everything, and we have learned that Mayor Chen and Vice Minister Jiang of the Ministry of Industry will personally attend the meeting.</p>
<h3>Primary and Secondary School Principals Bid Farewell to Former Director of Education Bureau</h3>
<p>The principals and staff of public primary and secondary schools in the first and eighth districts of this city held a tea party at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM to bid farewell to the former Director of the Education Bureau, Lin Zheng An, and welcome the new Director, Zai Ying Fu. More than 300 principals and staff from various schools attended. During the event, the former Director Lin gave a speech, stating that the reason for his resignation was not that he was tired of education work, but that after five years in office, he had roughly established a framework for the reorganization of education in Shanghai. In the future, the important task of carrying it forward should be left to predecessors with more knowledge and experience, and Director Zai is the most suitable candidate. The new Director then gave a speech, stating that the strong Anglo-American character of the public primary and secondary schools in the first and eighth districts will be reduced under the unified municipal administration, and that they will follow the national curriculum and move forward in step. As for the teaching staff of various schools who have served for ten or twenty years or more, this spirit of dedication is particularly admirable.</p>
<h3>Health Bureau Forms Injection Inspection Team</h3>
<p>The Municipal Epidemic Prevention Committee is actively carrying out the second phase of epidemic prevention injections. Although the weather is gradually turning cooler, the cholera danger period has not yet passed. Therefore, Director Yuan of the Health Bureau has strictly warned the epidemic prevention personnel under his command not to slack off. Recently, the Epidemic Prevention Section, in addition to the original injection teams, has formed two mixed injection and inspection teams to inspect pedestrians on the main roads of various districts at any time. If anyone is found not carrying a certificate, they will be forcibly injected, and the police bureau will assign two police officers to accompany the team to assist in their work. It is reported that the number of injections in the second phase, as of now, is about one million. Among them, the Hongkou area, which is under the responsibility of the Navy Baojia Squad, has already had more than 500,000 injections. Waterborne epidemic prevention matters are the responsibility of the Jianghai Customs Quarantine Station, and they are also actively promoting it. The authorities hope that the citizens of this city will promptly request injections to assist the government in completing the epidemic prevention work as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Boiled Water Shops Illegally Raising Prices</h3>
<p>Since the restriction of tap water supply in this city, the water flow has been small. Unexpectedly, a small number of boiled water shops are taking advantage of this opportunity to sell each ladle of boiled water for five yuan in order to make exorbitant profits. This is not uncommon in the Nanshi area. It is hoped that the authorities will stop this in order to reduce the daily water burden of the citizens.</p>
<h3>Trademark Bureau Recompiles Registration Instructions</h3>
<p>The Trademark Bureau of the Ministry of Industry has recently actively adjusted trademark administration. In order to enable the industrial and commercial sectors to understand the registration instructions for trademark applications, a detailed description of the registration process is provided. Industrial and commercial enterprises wishing to apply for trademark registration can directly inquire at No. 30, Lane 83, Yuyuan Road.</p>

<h3>A Review and Outlook on Government Purchase of Yarn and Cloth</h3>
<p>— Shi Huichen</p>
<p>The government has been purchasing yarn and cloth for exactly one year now. As an employee of a weaving factory, I will briefly discuss the main points of my personal experience below: The purchase order was announced on August 10th of last year, with a deadline of September 6th. The entire industry commented, "In order to punish hoarding, reduce speculation, suppress prices, and stabilize people's livelihoods, we will overcome all difficulties and resolutely do this." Today, it goes without saying that it has not achieved the expected results. However, the industrial and commercial sectors understand the government's good intentions and have not complained at all. The people's cooperation with the government's policies and their loyalty and sincerity are evident here.</p>
<p>Looking back on the past year, those in the factories involved with yarn and cloth have been stagnant, hoping every day that a unified distribution system will be realized as soon as possible. Unexpectedly, not only is there no distribution in sight, but most of the first-phase payment has not yet been settled. This has caused industrial and commercial enterprises to suspend work and sit idly by for years. Especially for factories that use cotton yarn and cloth as raw materials, workers cannot be completely dismissed, and staff cannot be completely reduced. Continuing to operate without raw materials, and changing to other industries without funds, they are not understood by the government above, and blamed by employees below. In addition, the cost of living is increasing and the burden is getting heavier. They are wandering around all day, unable to do anything. The suffering in this situation is something that outsiders cannot know, let alone government relief.</p>
<p>Logically speaking, since the industrial and commercial enterprises in this city have suffered so much pain by cooperating with the government's policies, the government should provide assistance within the scope of not violating national policy. It can be said that there are four points:</p>
<p>1. Regardless of whether it has been inspected and accepted, the first phase of payment should be settled quickly (those that have not been inspected and accepted should, of course, speed up the inspection and acceptance. The blame for the delay is not with the merchants.) to show good faith.</p>
<p>2. The second phase of payment should be issued in advance to provide funds for management and operation.</p>
<p>3. Fixed-term deposit certificates should actually be allowed for full mortgage. (In the past, it seemed to be nominal rather than actual.)</p>
<p>4. The raw material distribution limit should be implemented within a specified period to ensure continued production.</p>
<p>If the above four items can be implemented quickly, then the losses and suffering suffered by the industrial and commercial enterprises in the past year will not be entirely meaningless. After all, the purpose of the control policy is to "increase production" and "rationally distribute," which are the unchanged principles. Without production, how can there be distribution? Therefore, our government has specifically designated this year as the year of production. It is especially important for the government and the people to work together towards this goal and strive to move forward in order to fulfill our responsibility as East Asians and complete the desire for final victory.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Economic Affairs Announcement</h3>
<p>Municipal Economic Document No. 18</p>
<p>Regarding the deadline for industrial and commercial registration, this bureau has repeatedly extended the deadline and issued notices. However, it has been found that a significant number of industrial and commercial enterprises in this city have failed to register by the deadline. As the unified industrial and commercial statistics of the city must be completed immediately, and further delays cannot be tolerated, in consideration of the difficulties faced by businesses, the deadline is extended by another month until September 30th of this year. Those who still fail to register by the extended deadline will be punished according to regulations or face suspension of business. Furthermore, all relevant food and beverage manufacturers and businesses in this city that have not yet registered must apply to this bureau for registration within the specified period and must not delay. This is hereby announced for compliance.</p>

<p>The inaugural small-scale football league, which began on July 8th, has been running for two months and has achieved excellent results.</p>

On Wednesday of this week, the Harmony team will play against the Friendship team in the A group final. This match was postponed from last week due to scheduling conflicts. Harmony suffered a crushing defeat against Huatong in their first match, so they must give their all against Friendship, or their championship hopes will be jeopardized. In addition to the B, C, and D group finals and the A group Friendship vs. Huatong match this weekend, an additional performance match will be added, with White Horse playing against Weilian. This will undoubtedly be another exciting event. The schedule is as follows:</p>

<p>Table Tennis Group Finals: Friendship and Jingwu Triumph</p>
<p>The All-China National Table Tennis Tournament, organized by the Shanghai Table Tennis Association, held its "Up," "Joint," and "Association" group finals yesterday (3rd) at 1:00 PM on the fourth floor of the Jingwu Athletic Association. Yu Binqi, Chen Linsheng, Fu Hanjun, Chen Jimao, Zhang Zhihong, and others served as referees, with Hu Jiankun and Li Shaoguang as recorders. In the match between the Postal Workers team and China Electric in the "Up" group, the former won 5-2, securing the top spot in that group. In the match between Jingwu and Yue Lian in the "Joint" group, the competition was fierce. Jingwu narrowly defeated Yue Lian 4-3, claiming the top spot in the "Joint" group. In the final match of the "Up" group between Friendship and Harmony, the former had abundant talent and boasted first-class players such as Jiang, and thus won easily 6-1. However, the fact that Jiang lost to the young Chen Huiliang was certainly unexpected and a dark horse. The above six teams, having secured the top two spots in their respective groups, will have a championship final to determine the national championship.</p>
<p>Shaoxing Cup Basketball Tournament: Shantou Team vs. Qunyi</p>

<p>Cherished Wish (11)</p>
<p>In the singing class, there are many retired soldiers and people related to communications, but there is absolutely no one as young as Sanfu, who is only twenty-three years old, so everyone likes him. From the first day he took office, he cut his artist's disheveled hair short, making his face look particularly young, and his expression was somewhat flattered, truly like a little servant.</p>
<p>He enjoys working in this cheerful and bright atmosphere within the department. This cheerfulness and brightness is different from when he is with his artist companions. Even when busy, there are jokes, but there are no pranksters. It always feels like no one wants to show off their "hobbies" outwardly. Soon, Sanfu realized that this was the naval spirit, and he dared not be careless.</p>
<p>As Lieutenant Colonel Feitian said, his job is very simple. The leaflets with transmission-style drawings are stacked high in the narrow compartment. He thinks this is an easy task, and as for being casual and lazy, their conscience no longer allows him to do so. He has deeply absorbed the atmosphere of the department, and the awareness that he is a member of the reporting department has emerged in every cell of his body. The thought of penetrating the navy has unknowingly disappeared.</p>
<p>But once, unexpected good news reached his ears.</p>
<p>"Muta Koukun, you and photographer T-kun will participate in this small exercise!"</p>
<p>This was the order issued by Lieutenant Colonel Feitian.</p>
<p>Sanfu exclaimed, "Oh!" and was laughed at by the lieutenant colonel for a long time.</p>
<p>Although it is called a small exercise, it is by no means a small-scale exercise. It is different from basic exercises, and involves various warships participating in large-scale operations and combat actions.</p>
<p>Longfu and T staff member boarded the [blank] warship from a certain naval port. For the first time becoming a "shipman," he was as happy as ascending to heaven. However, on the vast and expansive ocean, when the exercise began, he was transferred from a battleship to a light cruiser, and then to a destroyer, so that he could observe the battle from all possible angles. He saw the trajectories of torpedoes, like shooting stars, converging on the battleship from all directions. Longfu watched carefully as the main guns of the main battleship flashed and emitted smoke of a certain color. This was an unexpected sight of light and color that could not be imagined in a movie. However, the majestic appearance of the I-class submarine surfacing suddenly stirred up a large wave in his heart. (138)</p>
<p>(12)</p>
<p>Not long after returning from that exercise, Longfu received a letter from Zhenren that he had been longing for.</p>
<p>(Where did it come from?)</p>
<p>Thinking of this, he looked at the back of the envelope, which had the door number of his hometown in Kagoshima written on it.</p>
<p>According to the content of the letter, Zhenren had spoken to Wu in Zhenshi and was going home to visit his relatives. The letter said that he was very happy to see his mother, brother Siji, and the teachers at No. 2 Middle School. He further wrote that he had heard that Longfu was serving in the reporting department, and he was very happy. He also said that he had been promoted to lieutenant, and that they should encourage each other and vow to sacrifice everything for the country and the nation.</p>
<p>However, he wrote in detail about bringing back hemp fabrics for the family, which made his mother very happy. He also said at the end that he would soon return to his post, but he failed to write where exactly he was being posted.</p>
<p>After reading this letter, Longfu immediately ran to the post office on the main road and sent a telegram to his father.</p>
<p>—Zhenren is in Kagoshima.</p>
<p>This short telegram contained a profound meaning. He himself was unable to discuss the marriage with Zhenren in a letter. Fortunately, Zhenren had gone home, and his father could meet Zhenren to negotiate directly. If the situation allowed, he could go to see him with his younger sister. In short, he should not miss the good opportunity. He believed that the short telegram hinted at these meanings.</p>
<p>Several days later, his father wrote back. It turned out that his father and sister had already met Zhenren before receiving Longfu's telegram. Zhenren, wearing the uniform of a lieutenant, appeared proudly and energetically at the door of Longfu's house an hour before he was scheduled to return to his post. He had only returned home to visit his relatives for one night. His father introduced Longfu to Zhenren, but because his own mother had declined, he more resolutely declined Longfu's father. However, his sister did not say a word, and only stared at each other at the door for a few minutes. Of course, his father was a little dissatisfied. This was all in the letter.</p>
<p>Longfu stepped on the carpet and felt very regretful.</p>
<p>(Wouldn't it have been better to say a word?)</p>
<p>Thus, he resented his younger sister for not being clever. Why had she, who did not treat men as men, become so traditional? Zhenren unknowingly felt that she had become a traditional girl from the Satsuma region. However, Longfu knew very well that the Sama girls who always obeyed and did not assert their own opinions had a burning desire in their hearts.</p>
<p>He certainly felt that what he had recently seen in the exercise was complete, and he had finally achieved his long-cherished wish to serve in the "Navy." The happiness of having his wish fulfilled was great. However, his younger sister's writing was not like this. When will his younger sister's long-cherished wish be fulfilled?</p>
<p>Community Service: Johnson Chemical Factory Establishes Work-Study Program</p>
<p>Since the launch of the reader scholarship program by this newspaper, countless out-of-school youths have been assisted. However, due to limited donations, only tuition assistance has been provided. In this era of soaring prices and difficult living conditions, it is even more difficult to study in peace. Therefore, a work-study program has been conceived to generate income for scholarship students without interfering with their studies, in order to supplement insufficient living expenses. After consultations with Johnson Chemical Factory, they expressed great sympathy and agreed to jointly organize a work-study program for scholarship students. The initial products for promotion will be [blank] water and ink powder produced by the factory. If the sales performance is excellent, other daily necessities produced by the factory's affiliated companies, such as soy sauce, coal balls, and leather shoe polish, will be gradually added. Students can make use of their spare time to promote the products to classmates, businesses, and households in the vicinity. The commission is tentatively set at 20% of the selling price to show consideration. The work is extremely convenient, does not interfere with studies, and provides valuable commercial sales experience. It is truly a win-win situation. The number of part-time salespersons for this program is tentatively set at 200, limited to middle school and university students receiving scholarships from this newspaper. Those who wish to participate in this program can come to this office to obtain an application form. Qualified applicants will be recommended to the Johnson Chemical Factory office to arrange for receiving goods. The offer is valid while supplies last. Please pay attention.</p>
<p>The Educational Character of the Former Shanghai Municipal Council Chinese Public Schools</p>
<p>Ueno Taihei</p>
<p>(1) Introduction</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council has become a historical term. The Chinese schools established by the Shanghai Municipal Council (Note 1) were renamed Shanghai Special Municipal City Schools on August 1st of last year. Time flies, and the reform of the school's name and structure has already been a whole year. However, most of the municipal schools that were formerly established by the Shanghai Municipal Council still use the name of the Shanghai Municipal Council schools on their signs and in people's speech. This may be because the former Chinese schools have decades of history and are deeply rooted and difficult to change the name suddenly; perhaps the former Chinese schools do have a special status that makes people happy to call them. We do not want to delve into this superficial problem of naming. However, according to the statements published by the educational administrative authorities in various newspapers from February 20th to 25th of this year, it can also be proved that the former Chinese schools have some special features. (Note 2) Regarding these special features, we do not want to praise them as advantages, nor do we want to denigrate them as disadvantages. It can only be said that they are different from the public or innovative. Originally, education cannot be carried out away from the times and social environment. So now there is no need to criticize the past from the perspective of the new era. What is described in this article is nothing more than a comprehensive description of the characteristics of the education of the former Shanghai Municipal Council Chinese schools for decades, so that people who are enthusiastic about education can choose and correct them.</p>
<p>(2) Characteristics of the Starting Point</p>
<p>The former Shanghai Municipal Council has always adopted a passive attitude towards education. Its purpose was only to improve the people's knowledge, reduce criminal behavior, and maintain the safety and order of the concession. In 1911 and 1933, the Education Committee repeatedly stated that the Shanghai Municipal Council only had a moral responsibility for education, and did not regard education as an inherent responsibility like other administrative organs, and adopted a positive approach. For decades, although various Chinese committees have worked hard to hope that the authorities will change their course, they have not been able to get rid of the conservative old habits under the rule of the British. For example, after 1928, although the Shanghai Municipal Council seemed to want to change its educational policy and claimed to implement the so-called "Eight-Year Education Plan," it eventually gave up halfway and did not reach half of the standard. (Note 3) Although the Chinese Education Department was established in the midst of difficulties, it has not opened up much new territory despite its best efforts. Originally, more than 95% of the people in the concession were Chinese, so of course all or at least 95% of those receiving school education should be Chinese. Then the names of "Chinese" Education Department and "Chinese Children" School (Chinese Education Office) (S.M.C. School for Chinese Children) are not necessary at all. The reason for this is nothing more than that the concession authorities are dividing a cup of leftovers for the sake of Western schools. The starting point of the passive aesthetic influenced the educational policy of the Shanghai Municipal Council for decades. The administrative authorities are like this, and the schools under their control are of course not easy to be active in development. But it is precisely in this environment that if one can overcome all difficulties to seek construction, it is also a time when the festival is seen, and it is worthy of praise.</p>
<p>(3) Characteristics of Curriculum and Teaching</p>
<p>The curriculum of Chinese secondary schools - the curriculum of Chinese secondary schools does not follow the curriculum standards promulgated by the Ministry of Education, but takes preparing for admission to Hong Kong University or Cambridge University in the United Kingdom as the highest goal. However, primary schools can still be implemented in accordance with the curriculum standards. The general situation is briefly described as follows.</p>
<p>Comparison of Chinese and Western Courses</p>
<p>The curriculum of Chinese secondary schools is divided into two types: Chinese courses and Western courses. Chinese courses refer to Chinese studies, Chinese history and geography, and the rest are completely Western courses. Comparing the two, Chinese and Western are not opposed to each other. The former is only a subsidiary subject. Students obviously do not pay attention to Chinese due to environmental reasons. Here, let me cite a few simple examples to illustrate the general situation.</p>
<p>1. The salary of Western teachers is higher than that of Chinese teachers.</p>
<p>2. The Chinese teachers of the Beiqu Laohua Real Public School did not have offices, while the Western teachers all had comfortable writing desks. Because of this, when Chinese teachers came to school, they could only sit on the benches on both sides, which was quite similar to the current eagle head shop. This matter is still passed down as a joke, and it can also be seen that Chinese teachers are despised.</p>
<p>3. Students like to speak English. It seems out of fashion not to include two sentences of English in Chinese. Although it is difficult to accurately count the time spent preparing for homework, at least Chinese is regarded as a secondary matter.</p>
<p>4. In Huayi Middle School, there are many Chinese teachers with excellent foundations in Chinese studies who have to be inferior to others.</p>
<p>5. In many subjects that do not need to be taught in English, teachers often use English to teach. The commands in physical education and the books and explanations in science are mostly used in English, which shows its importance.</p>
<p>In this case, it is not easy to improve the Chinese level. If students' Chinese level is not self-taught at home, it can only be attributed to the foundation of their childhood. Only Mr. Huang Zhongsu, the vice principal of Nie Gongcheng Chinese Public School, had a unique vision and once drafted a plan to improve Chinese teaching and put it into practice. Although he focused on ancient prose such as Han Yuwen and Tongchengwen, his plan was indeed famous for a time. Unfortunately, due to environmental reasons, other schools could not earnestly follow it. But at least in Chinese secondary schools, a ray of dawn has been released for the future of Chinese studies. As for the primary school curriculum, although it is said to be in accordance with the curriculum standards, more guidance is added to the Chinese subject. After graduating from primary school, students should feel that their Chinese level has not reached the standard. And the connection between primary and secondary schools is even more difficult to connect. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Free Smoking Cessation: Fourth Session Completed</p>
<p>The temporary free smoking cessation center, co-founded by this office and the Nantong Road Middle School Righteousness Association, has completed its fourth session of smoking cessation. The participants were sent off on the 3rd of this month, and at the same time, a trial was held for the participants of the first, second, and third sessions. All participants attended on time. The results of the trial were quite good, and there were no cases of relapse, which shows their strong determination. On the same day, the Huasheng Pharmaceutical Research Institute held a banquet at the Chinese Teachers' Association, with Zhou Yuying, Director of the Welfare Department, Chen Dongbai, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Welfare Department, and Ding Fubao, Guan Suishuang, Li Suizhi, Deng Qingshan, Zheng Digong, Liu Zhigang, Liu Buqing, Lu Zhixue, Zhou Mengbai, Zhang Dounan and other medical and pharmaceutical elders, totaling more than 30 people, so they were able to participate in the grand event and encouraged the smoking cessation compatriots and expressed their sympathy for the establishment of the free smoking cessation center. During the banquet, Dr. Sun Zhujun, Zhao Boyi, and Sun Shanjun of the Huasheng Pharmaceutical Research Institute gave enthusiastic hospitality and explained in detail the efficacy and function of the institute's latest product, "Shengkang Duping" smoking cessation injection, until 4 o'clock, and the guests and hosts enjoyed themselves.</p>
<p>It is heard that the institute is planning to adjust its smoking cessation methods due to rising prices and tight funds. The institute plans to restrict the enrollment of smoking cessation participants to those between the ages of 20 and 40 and will conduct smoking cessation twice a month. Smokers who wish to register should pay attention.</p>
<p>Charity Schools and Scholarships</p>
<p>Peiben Middle School aims to rescue out-of-school children. Tuition and fees are completely free. Classes are held for three hours every day and five hours on Saturdays and Sundays.
