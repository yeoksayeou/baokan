<p>社評</p>
<h3>請求政府獎勵農業生產</h3>
<p>自從民廿六年以後，農村農地頗多荒發，耕地總面積，雖無整個正確統計，但據各種經濟團體的局部調査，比較民廿六年以前，减少頗多，迄至目前尚未恢復原狀。這種事實，就增加生產的觀點而言，當然是亟須調整的要務。可是，近數年間，就農作物的種類，分別此較，則稻居第一位，麥居第二位，再次爲棉花。民廿六年以前，則種棉而積多於種粉，適成相反。共主要原因，當在近年糧食價格高漲，種稻利　高於種棉。這種趨勢，原爲極自然的結果。</p>
<p>可是，自從米糧統制以後，農民感受收買價格過於抑低，益以收購人員的作弊，壓迫農民，農民不敷成本。於是種植糧食，漸趨消極態度。</p>
<p>然而，前者由種棉改爲種稻，就糧食問題的觀點，尚爲適應需要的轉變，桑榆之收，未可原非。而後者就食糧增產的觀點，乃爲極嚴重的問題，如不亟謀補救，則糧食問題發生根本危機，影響所及，決非空言可以彌補，決非短期可以挽救。</p>
<p>據一股實地報告與觀察，最近旬日間，正値農民種稻時期，而農民心理大率在猶豫之中，種稻吧，感於低價收買的壓迫，鼓不起與趣；種棉吧，惟恐不能解決本身曁一家的食糧問題。在身受痛苦經騐以後，交織着舉棋不定的選擇心理，於是可能發生兩種結果，第一是減少種稻面積，逃避低價收買的　觸。第二是縱然種稻，也抢消極態度，不肯勤於耕耘，祗以自身暨一家食糧足够卽了事，犯不着動勤懇懇，結果等於白做。而道兩種結果，都是造成食糧减產的嚴重危機。今年是政府提出的增產年，豈非背道而馳。而事實上粉食產量就是　持以往數額已感不敷，如果再有减產傾向，則不敷更甚，豈非趨於自殺之途。</p>
<p>所以，無論從理論與實際立論，目前農民正在選擇作物的猶豫時期，我們認爲是政府當局勸導應趨途徑的最緊要咔機，如果再不加以適切的勸導，則時機稍縱即逝，挽救莫及。猶之吃鷄與吃蛋，二者孰利。如果希望永久吃蛋，必須保護母鷄健康·如果希望吃　而殺之，則鶏死蛋必無由所取。如果卽想吃　而殺之，又想永久吃蛋，則事實上決不可能。我們認爲與其殺　後一次吃鷄，而不能永久吃蛋，不如永久吃蛋而鸚則尚仔。所以，我們主張：</p>
<p>第一，請求政府當局從速通令軍事機關，轉令各地各部隊，禁止直接向農民收買糧食，並佈告幾民，使眾邇知。一面軍米所無由統一機關用合理價格統收統給。同時，希望盟邦軍事當局充分協助，也通令禁止類似直接收買之事，従此可以减少農民心理上所受的威脅與恐慌。</p>
<p>第二，必要之收質糧食，必須計算農民所耗之成本，計算時應包括農民的勞力部分，並使有些微門，予以切實保障，從此減少農民心理上最大的刺激。</p>
<p>策三，統制來糧方法，實行近年，不可否認是失敗的，是不合現實環境的。近據富有經騐者的寶貴意見，認爲除軍米爲必要收買，計算最合理的價格，探用最公道的方法，責成地方當局與地方商會，向農民直接收買以外，其餘民食米粉，可以放棄統制，自由流通興買責。鑒於過去統制的痛苦經騐，鑒於目前的反動趨勢，更鑒於今後的嚴重危機，確是値得重加檢討與考慮的一點。</p>
<p>上面所述三點，目前已屆緊急措置的最後咔機，不可或綏了。而這三點是先決問顆，解決以後，才能談到增加生產。如果漢視先決問題而侈談增產，直是痴人說夢而已。</p>
<h3>巴列爾周圍混亂　日印軍勇猛創敵　梅克特拉附近擊落六敵機</h3>
<p>東京一日中央社電據印度前綫某基地電，據守巴列爾東方縱深陣地之頑敵第二十師團主力及第二十三師團一部，共約萬二于名，已自四月二十八日夜起開始全面後退，刻正自各山頂陸續遙向巴列爾隘路口退却，現巴列爾尚　到處均爲敵軍後退部隊，放巳陷混亂狀態。日印軍精銳部隊則猛烈繫此等敵軍，予以重創，日軍某部隊突入四五六二高地顛諾巴爾西北二公里之一角，另一部隊繞至塞保姆陣地背後，於塞保姆·先拿奶四五六二高地問，猛攻敵軍約三千。是項敵軍擁有十五哇加農砲二門，十二糧榴彈砲八門，山砲七門及其他迫繫砲等，日軍巳使彼蒙潰減打擎。又日軍某部隊進至法爾布恩巴列爾東方十公里西方，當使該地頑敵殲滅。又日軍另一部隊砲擊　達密，瓦基公路上之敵單約千口，印度國民軍亦與日軍精銳部隊協刀，急向前進，威脅敵之退路，總之，巴列爾殲减作戰，刻正已達最高潮。</p>
<p>仰光一日中央社電緬甸方面日陸軍戰鬥機隊，二十九日晨邀擊來　梅克特拉附近之敵機約三十架，擊落敵p24譏一架及其他型機五架。使殘餘敵機遁逃，日方無損害。</p>
<h3>日印軍作戰順利予英方打擊重大</h3>
<p>東京一日中央社電　因日·印軍伊姆法爾作戰順利，故無論於戰略上。經濟上·政治上，均予敵人以重大打擊，敵人不僅喪失重要之戰略據點，南北之聊絡亦被截斷，且北部唯一之孟加拉·阿薩密鐵路，已蒙重大威脅。同時，渝方輪血路之開闢工作，亦因而停頓，今作戰上及戰略上之主動權，已操於日印軍手中·又在經濟上，阿薩密省東部及北部地方肥沃地帶所產石油，約佔全印生產量之百分之七十六，同時每年產煤三十萬噸，而此等地方之產業，亦因日·印軍作戰順利進展而陷停頓。昆連北部高原地區之茶國生產亦將停頓，而最大之軍需工業地帶如煤·錳及靈毌等原料供給地比哈爾。噢里薩兩省，今已處於日軍立體行動範圍之中，故此時不僅可使印度軍需生產與戰力蒙致命打擊，同時更可使東印各省自身之戰身減弱。今英·美之焦燥狼狽，已因日·印軍之向孟加拉挺進面益見擴大。以政治書，印度後方國民，因英。印軍　戰皆北，且得悉江特拉飽斯　成印國民軍，刻已陷於一大混亂，於是龍工。怠工·示威運動不絕，租稅運動及妨害交通等暴動相繼而起，彼等首行破壞鐵路，一並於阿薩密·孟加拉鐵路之車站内及列車內散放「自由印度萬歲」，「江特拉鮑斯　歲』等反英傳彈單。至罷工及怠工，則以工塲及農國爲開端。又東印居民於高度之反英情緒中，向他處遷移者頗象，於是遂造成社會不安之混亂現象。印人紛紛爭取大量食物，因而愈使物價高漲，物質缺乏時，曾傳國民會議派依　存在，且從事各種活動。英當局爲鎮壓計，已使軍隊出動維持治安，一方土侯國中反對封一建及土侯壓制之運動日益活發，加以因戰爭關係人民負擔過重，糧食亦行缺乏，政社會之動搖遂漸次加甚，而英國非但不能由土候國得到財政及軍事之援助，且更感受印人包括英霞印度及土候領結成共同戰綫威脅之。</p>
<h3>加拉頓區作戰　英失敗原因</h3>
<p>加拉頓一日中央社電　敵軍　菸第一次阿拉坎之　劇，此次在加拉頓巳改用新奇戰衛，以慣於森林作戰之非洲黑人爲先鋒，以減少英兵之犧牲，利用空軍輸送彈藥。給養，並以機槍。迫繫砲等爲主，配備於山川險峻之處，企國以攻擊戰術使日軍疲於海命，此所謂蒙涿特巴頓一流之戰街，然而日軍之神速作戰，已使此種戰術毫無奏效之餘地，到歲予敵以殲滅之打擎。更以新奇大砲克服險惡道路，勇猛進擎，予敵以重創，更黑人部隊心膽俱寒，此皆日軍戰街優秀之表堄，頗値大書特畫也。日軍以米爲主食，而英軍食糧以小麥爲主，故小麥與米之出產問題，亦頗能左有戰局，在阿拉坎山脈及比山山脈綿互萬里之狹窄平地中，絕不能出產大量小麥，然而英軍毫未顯及於此，竟　然進攻加拉頓，此其本身失敗原因之一也。英軍自開始阿拉坎作戰以來，其給養之補充，全賴空中輪送，每日以陶格拉斯式飛機七八架往返　送，然而除彈藥。兵器及英人軍官外，對黑人土兵之食糧輪送，爲數極少，故因此引起黑人之不平及暴動，亦爲其失敗原因之一也。敵以降落傘投下之食糧，大部爲麵包·澳洲牛肉乾·牛乳乾·美國慕茄　頭·阿拉斯加薩門魚·各種墓于　及茶葉等，此皆印度輸送力困難故也。尤其加拉頓地區呱密林地帶，作戰必先開關道路，英軍對飛機塲·汽車路之開關極感棘手，或有開通者，亦均被日軍以神速作戰予以佔領，敵軍以迫繫砲爲主要火器，但一遇日軍之新奋大砲，則威力全失。進入巴雷特瓦之日軍，現仍　阿拉坎之密林向前一進攻，日軍之神速進攻下，敵之密林戰術將全歸於無用，同時，印緬南部之日軍，亦將因北部之勝利而放異彩。</p>
<h3>爪哇治水</h3>
<p>萬隆一日中央社電　爪哇軍政監部頃擬定琴德河治水三年計劃即將着一手宽施，產業部，交通部及布利安根州關係官員，已於二十五日出作實地踏査。按該河爲流經爪哇西部布利安根州及班紐馬斯州境之大河，上游爲稀有之密林溫地帶，雨季河水氾濫，附近田產被害甚鉅，二十餘年前，附近住民會吧求荷蘭政府與建排水一工事，迄今未能實現，十數年前，當地縣政府曾在沿岸完成三千公頃之儷溉徘水工事，但未能防止災害，故此次重立計劃，第一年度擬完成若千公頃之排水開墾工事，完成後便利住民，自不待言，對於爪哇之增產食糧，亦有莫大貢獻。</p>
<h3>美機裝備拙劣可證物質缺乏</h3>
<p>東京一日中央社電　美國因飛機損失過鉭，努力增產結果，已陷於粗裂濫造之情勢，三月二十三日，敵機空襲塞本時，曾被擊落轟炸機一架於西北海面，經撈起後，由該機之裝製可窺見美國目下飛機製造之粗劣一斑。該已死之駕駛員頭上所戴之飛行煩，僅能護及雙頰，所着飛行衣巳襤褸不堪，降落傘似難於張開，且爲人造紙所製者，機巾亦無携帶之食糧，僅有少許救急藥品，彼等裝置完善之飛機尚且如此，亦足窺美國物資貫缺乏之現狀矣。彼等因盡力於大量生產，故飛機之質極劣，雖其防彈玻璃尚稱堅固，但美機之裝備遠不及日本之萬一也</p>
<h3>麥克沃塞　不參加競選</h3>
<p>日內瓦一日中央社電　德國新聞社訉，據夾目紑約之報告稱：麥克沃塞將軍頃於其新幾內亞總司令部聲明，不願爲參加綛統競選之共和黨候選人，因此其派駐芝加哥之調度競選總統候選事宜之沙伐基氏，即宣布　止活動</p>
<h3>首都警備部電賀主席誕辰</h3>

<h3>中央電訊社　成立四週年　林宣傅部長親臨致訓</h3>

<h3>漠市提倡　婚喪節約</h3>
<p>漢口一日中央社電　市社會局以市民狃於積習，對婚喪務必大事鋪張，作無爲爲消耗，當此參戰時期，有遠消費節約之旨，除喪葬一項已由市衛生局建鞏火葬傷，動行火葬外，對於結婚節約，該局特擬定集短接婚計劃，即將於下月間舉辦。並已飭所屬公務會員首先示範，俾符節約消畫原旨</p>

<h3>吉田東言論集再版序</h3>
<p>— 陳彬</p>
<p>申報發行吉田東祐言論集，第一集三千册，出版後數月間即被争購一空，從這裹可以看出一般國人對於吉田先生言論重視的程度。吉田先生的文章，每一篇都有特殊的熱力，足以喚起每一個中國　者的共鳴，特別是因爲他對於中國問題，經過深刻而認眞的研究之後，暸解其　結所在，發爲言論，使自然能把握人心了。</p>
<p>吉田先生文章，不僅爲國人所愛謮，而且爲毎一個眞正關切中日國交及東亞民族團結前途的日太朋友所愛謮，因爲從他的文常裹，可以更淸晰地了解中國，更正確地認識中日關係及其以後應取的涂經。所以，當吉田先生言論集日文版問世時，同樣爲日方人士所爭先購謮。我們深深感覺，爲着中國，爲蕭日本，像吉田先生那樣的文章，實有更廣泛地傳播的價値。</p>
<p>吉田先生的言論，巳到了爲中日各界人士成爲嗜妤而争謮的程度，然而他絕不輕率立言，他的更大部份的時間，是用在學問與研究上面的，他那種廠心謙相地聆取中國人民的意見，甚至對於反對的批評，同樣表現其客觀的精神，誠意地接受。我們爲日本慶幸有這樣的政論家，我們更慶幸有這樣某心地研究促進中日國交的專家學者。雖然我們深　中國目前正缺乏　此種人少，但是，如果兩頭常局就吉田先生的嘗論加以研究採釋，一定還有更大的　獻吧。</p>
<p>當茲吉田先生補充的言論集問世之際，我們不能不爲中國謮者　幸，我們希望吉田先生那種勤學的精神，公正的熊度，和立言的大義，能够在中日人士間激生更大的影響。四月二十九日。</p>

<h3>日菲間國交緊密　經濟提携益強化　滿皇昨招待阿齊諾等一行</h3>
<p>馬尼刺一日中央社電　菲國戰後之　設，經獨立後六個月之努力，其　進態勢，日益　固，自阿齊諾國會議長領導之答禮使節團訪日後，日。菲兩國間之國交，自更進趨緊密。阿齊諾大使為前勞動服務國副總裁，獨立之後，轉任國會議長，為一始終一貫擁戴洛勒爾大總統者，亦可謂建設新菲律賓之副大總統。隨員猶洛大審院長，阿拉斯財長奧亞西斯勞動服務團副總裁等，均為新政府之權威者，誠如情報局所發表使節團一行為代表菲國國民　謝日本之　　獨立，並參觀決戰下日本之　姿態，以為建設菲國之借鏡，而始有此次使節團一行之訪日。由於　長及財之之隨行訪日，此從日。菲兩國間經濟提携強化，以及菲島今後戰時物炎輸送等重要任務，將更加協力。勞動服務團改組為單一政黨從，集結國民總力之政黨已吿成功，於菲國政治上，尤屬一劃期創舉。戰時下之今日，舊政黨之解散，政黨思想之掃除，在新菲國之建設，以及國民總力之築結上，實屬必要。基於以上要點，新組成之勞動服務團，將先從事封國民東洋精神之灌輸，展開活潑之民族集結遝動，獨立之際，該服務團曾承認憲法草案，選舉大總統，國會議員等，担任新政府誕生之偉大任務。今更進一步，為期全國民協力政府起見，以洛勒爾大總統為總裁，更決定實施新網要，今後將以洛勒爾為統率，担當國家思想上之指導。新設之經濟企劃院，為菲國經濟政策之最高參謀企劃協關，以達成國家緊急之食糧自給政策為首，洛哈斯委員長為菲島政界傑出人物，同時復為菲國之經濟權成者，其他各委員亦為有關經濟之各部會長官或經濟界名流，由於其陣容之強化，形成為菲國經濟最高機關。企劃院下設一米穀諮詢委員會，由洛哈斯自兼委員長，米糧之生產配給各施策，即將樹立，一向以不健康為理由，拒絕直接担當工作之洛哈斯氏，今竟不避艱困，挺身出長重要國策之食糧政策責任，其被注目以及其手腕之運用，頗堪期待。</p>
<p>新京一日中央社電　菲律賓國會議長阿齊諾偕猶洛大審院長。阿拉斯財政部長。阿爾南農政部長。奧西亞斯事務總畏等，一日上午九時四十八分參拜建國忠靈廟及忠靈塔，十一時三十分參晉宮，皇帝陛下當賜予單獨接見，中午並於嘉樂殿賜宴招待。皇帝陛下對於滿。菲兩國之親善，夙懷熱意，阿齊諾等此次曾蒙陛下賜予優渥　語。</p>
<h3>東綫德軍反攻　圖拉直戰綫</h3>
<p>柏林一日中央社電　海通社訊：東綫德軍進攻喀爾巴阡山麓·柯維區·與聶斯特河上游，其目的在改善陣地與拉直戰綫，準備應付行將來臨之大戰，此項發展頗為重要。</p>
<h3>柯洛米亞蘇軍增援</h3>
<p>布達佩斯一日中央社電　洪牙利軍事方面昨稱：鑒於蘇軍集中於柯洛米亞區之數量，且增援不絕抵達，且對洪軍陣地猛烈進攻，故蘇軍在該區之新突破企圖亦將實現。但現下蘇軍一切攻勢，均為洪軍堅強抵抗所擊破。</p>
<h3>斯達林　闡述戰局</h3>
<p>莫斯科一日中央社電　五一勞動節前夕，斯達林委員長對陸海軍將兵工人及遊擊部馬發表布告如次：目前戰況大致尚可滿意，蘇聯即在此種情勢下，欣逢本年之勞働節，英。美與蘇軍之勝利相呼應，芷在義　綫與德軍交鋒，並以轟炸極力破壞德軍戰力。蘇聯之從方，於過去曾忍受種種試　，又為增強戰力，曾作種種努力，吾決不以將敵軍逐出境外為滿足。現在英。美。蘇三國之聯合勢力，方為打倒德國唯一之力量。</p>
<h3>英自治領首相　會議閉幕</h3>
<p>瑞典京城一日中央社電　英聯邦首相會　，五月一日在英首相邱吉爾主持下於倫敦舉行。至該會議主旨，乃於重大戰局轉變之先，集英各聯邦首相於一堂交換各種意見。故其主要議題，大概為　處此戰局重大時機，如何確保自治鎮之協力。　於蘇聯對歐洲戰局推行自主外交政策之今日，如何維持英國地位。　加拿大。澳洲。紐西蘭各自治領現均有接近美國之情勢，如何保全美英兩國之聯邦關係。</p>
<h3>美國務副卿　訪問北非</h3>
<p>里期本一日中央社電　海通社訊，華盛頓息：美國務副卿史蒂丁尼斯現在北非，與美大使哈里曼及地中海反軸心軍總司令部美籍顧問　斐會商，內容未明，惟三人會晤之地點在摩洛哥之馬拉喀什</p>
<h3>蘇捷簽訂　互助協定</h3>
<p>瑞典京城一日中央社電　海通社訊：捷克流亡政府，申明於紅軍開入捷境時，願將捷克之軍事及非軍事力量，全部供蘇聯調遺。蘇代理外畏維辛斯基昨宣偉此事時稱，蘇聯經捷政府之發起，已與之訂立協定，決由捷克于紅軍開入時給予支援，紅軍將分該團為若干區，並自享管有轄權。</p>
<h3>侵歐何時發動　各方揣測紛紜　有人認王月為最適宜</h3>
<p>里期本一日中央社電　目下第二戰綫間題甚囂塵上，致歐洲空氣益形緊張。現德軍與反軸心軍均努力準備決戰，形成杜佛海狹兩方對峙形勢。英本土乃進攻歐陸之根據地一，故近一月以來已採取各種非常措置，除禁止外交官出入外，上月二十七日晚並禁止一般民眾出境，已陷於封鎖狀態。此舉目的一在刺戰德軍之注意力，使其陷於錯悞判斷，而收神經戰之功效，一在表明反軸心軍之第二戰綫勢在必行。關於此事，屋期泰晤士報某評論家曾謂，第二戰綫發動時期以杜佛海峽情勢及西歐戰門季節而論，應以五月為最適宜更有多數預備機尚未出動，故亦成一困難問題。星期泰晤士報軍事記者謂，破壞要塞與基地之鐵路頗為困難，倘係輕而易舉者，則義大利事不致遲遲難決矣。</p>
<p>安加拉一日中央社繼續若干時日。一部分人士對侵歐日期舉行猜獎，並討論在黑夜登陸或圓月時登陸之利弊，一致認侵歐之舉，　數個內之事。</p>

<h3>三省兩市內油漆自由運輸</h3>
<p>各種油漆均屬漆類，並不列入統制品範圍，　來本市油漆運往外埠，在清鄉區內往往遭受檢查人員之扣留。須向商統會方面探悉，油漆屬於漆類，在三省兩市區域以內搬運，因尚無限制明文，故可自由運輸，如從三省兩市區域內移往其他地域，則應取得該會之移出承認。</p>
<h3>布列坦尼海外夜戰加驅逐艦一艘擊沉</h3>
<p>柏林一日中央社電德海軍方面消息：布列坦尼（Brittany）北岸海外聖白里恩　發生夜戰，加拿大驟逐艦「愛薩巴斯加號被德魚雷艇所擊沉。參加比役者有德魚雷艇二艘，敵方則有巡洋艦及驅逐艦各數艘，於數量上及火力上均佔優勢，但仍躲避於德砲火射程之外而不取駛近作戰。於猛烈之砲火下，敵艦被命中　　，德船一艘始則活　作戰，終因受傷駛離戰地。另一艘則仍央勇單獨作戰，敵艦旋即中彈起火，火燄高約二百公尺，此或係被魚雷擊中其油池所致，船員損失甚重，被救者八十五名。據脫險船員稱，有另一艘敵方驅逐艦亦中彈沉失。敵力捐失詳情，俟審查餘生者之供辭後始能發表。</p>
<h3>研究·教育·生產的一體化—日本新工業大學的姿態—</h3>
<p>— 山本忠與</p>
<p>當前的要求</p>
<p>劃時代的增強生產，促進了學生們的勤勞服務。理論與實踐一致的教有理想，雖然是畸形的，畢竟也在某程度上實現了。尤以工業知識，僅賴抽象的把握是不夠的，必須體隨着實際的工業技術。且在目前國力與戰力希望大量生產的情形下，除各種工業之專門的向上發達外，更要求可實施大量生產的機構與技能。</p>
<p>另一方面，科學兵器必須具備超過敵國的新性能，迅速生產，迅速運用，因而發明研究，特別覺得重要。</p>
<p>這樣，教育，研究與生產三者雖有相關而不可分的關係，但在我國的教育界與產業界，這三者卻是互相分離的，各自為謀。自前的時局，促使修正這情形，教育界為了適應兵役與服務的關係而起的激變，不能不有相當的動搖。目前的工業教育，對這事態必須加以反省，計劃，並下英斷。</p>
<p>事業界的覺悟</p>
<p>在園際資本主義經濟機構之下，以金本位為武器的通商組織的產業支配時代，產業者以營利為目標，以利潤為指標，而經營事業。尤其在我國，因參加世界市場的落後，市場被限制的緣故。以致輸入新科學製品的商業者得以肆逞。之後，由於先覺者漸次產生了工廠生產機構，幾經試騐，而向大組織進展。但各產業公司關於本身業務具備研究機關者，實寥寥無幾，不肯由研究來創造別出心裁的新製品，而惟投下巨額的費用以獲得先進國發明的特許及其製法。在這時代，學術界不能獲得研究機關的便利，大多數研究論文者驅使教學理論探未指導工學的結論。</p>
<p>滿洲事變以來的我國國情，政洽外交都有了轉機，同樣，並也促進了產業誣營者的覺悟。一面脫離營利的目標，而以貢獻於國力戰力為目的，一面不惜在調查研究上耗費極資，產生了努力創製並改良製品的美風，並且也有許多人支提學生的研究了。</p>
<p>研究的兩面</p>
<p>研究有二方面，一是基礎的研究，另一是應用的研究。基礎的研究是用科學的洞察來分析現象的組成要素，在各種絛件之下，以之公式化，法則化。當然，綜合各要件而統一於更普遍的法則，是接近自然界偵相的道路。</p>
<p>至應用的研究，其使命在驅使，綜合已經發見的法則，以創造實用的機器，其精巧或可超越人號的五官之感覺，其強豪或可代行數萬的人力。人類縱為萬物之靈，其　機的進化，已過了頂點而進入退化期，但靠着勞力所生產的副裝置，而無限地擴大其能力。</p>
<p>在理學的研究上，基礎的研究為其使命，這是因為理論的發展已經沉潛在哲學的思維之領域究二方面，一方面是設定原理，他方面是使可應用於產業。這基礎的研究稱之為工學的研究，應用的研究雖也可稱之為工業的研究，但工業實騐與這種研究應該是有區別的。</p>
<p>工學教育的兩方面</p>
<p>工業教育當然也可以分二方面來考察。以前的工學教育，尤其是大學教育，僅以基礎的教育就以為夠了，這算是正統的而成為習慣，至於別的方法，既沒有老慮的餘裕，也沒有老盧的熱意</p>
<p>而在工業的實際上，對這種教育感到不便，而須重行教育。即如工業經營科、除工學教育之外，再加上法制，經濟，管理等學科，但這也祗打算增進經營的能率。眞正的工業技術者，為了實際進行研究與生產，應該是對工廠生活有深切的體騐者。</p>
<p>以工業大學之名而設立的大學，國內外很多，但除了根據過去的理念齣基礎教育和略為援近專門化的工業種類之外，沒有什麽特徽。偵正的工業大學，應該是在融合的形式上運行研究，教育與生產，使研究所與工廠與大學教育一體化。此在歐美亦不乏其例。</p>
<p>新工業大學之道</p>
<p>最近，電波機器工廠的主持者岩崎淸一氏，與其伴侶技術者早川幸吉氏，業已完成其計劃，政府方面亦予以相當獎勵，而要求各方面協力一新的工業大學。那是研究，教育，生產三位一體化的工業大學，在修學與研究與實習實際生活化的新理想下，工業教育者以前所未曾想及者，並視為不能實現者，部一一具現了。</p>
<p>由於岩崎氏齣提供私財與工廠設備，產生了融合應用的研究與修學與工廠生活的工業大學。同伴中視為幻夢般的新工業大學即可實現了。此可視為決戰的國情下所產工業教育之一　變。</p>
<p>在綜合的大學中，經過了長時期經騐的工學部，立在正統的古典的立場，新的單科工業大學，由其特徵而完成了新的發展。適應國家的要求，使我國工業教育急進，在戰時則完實戰力，在平時則充實國力。</p>
<p>這新工業大學的理想，除從事工業教育的同人外。大工業經營者的首腦者之間亦頗多贊同者，視為我國最高工業教育的一種發展。時代已經者為工學博士，前早大理工學部部長，新設久我山電波工業專門學校校長　（翔譯自遭　報知）</p>

<h3>市政諮詢委員會　昨首次會議　陳市長致詞闡述意義並致期待</h3>
<p>上海特別市政府，爲謀續極推進上海市政建設起見，特延聘本市負有聲望，對於地方事業素具熱忱者，如顏惠慶李·思浩·聞蘭亭·袁履登·林康侯·沈　良·裴復恒·李權時·朱愽泉·周作民·陳彬龢·金雄白·馮炳南·吳　齋·裴靈卿·項康原·吳震修·戴　　·郭順·唐壽民·趙正平·趙晋鄉·任筱姍·姚慶三·陳日平等二十五人，組織市政諮詢委員會，於昨（一日）爲該會第一次全體會議·於下午四時假座第一區公署會　室，正式舉行會　，出席者除陳市長吳秘書畏外，計到委員李思浩·聞　亭。袁　登·顏惠慶·唐壽民·林　侯·吳慈齊。趙正平·枕嗣良·裴復恒·李權時·朱榑泉·陳彬　·金雄白·馮炳南·裴　鄕·項康原·吳震修·戴藹廬·郭順·趙晋鄕·桃慶三·陳日平等二十三人，市府各局處長亦均到塲參加，首由陳市畏致開會詞云：</p>
<p>陳兼市長致開會詞</p>
<p>諸位先生：今天是上海特別市市政諮詢委員會第一次開會之期，也是上海公共租界和法租界收回上海市行政統一後第一次正式　合社會負責人士開始共同討論市政之期。諾位先生不但負有上海的重望，同時也負有中國的重望，以諸位先生的學識經歷，屈聘爲本市諮詢委負，不但本人與有榮幸，即上海和全國人士，對於諸位先生皆有無窮的期待與興奮。本人回憶在去年收回租界之開始，曾在民衆代表大會發表上海即須成立一臨時民意機關，所謂民意機關，或者恢復過去之臨時參議會，或者成立一個諮詢委員會，所以遲遲至今成立者，有兩個原因。第一個原因，自事變以後，市政固然談不到上軌道，就是社會組織和人民生活，也是紊亂不堪。深欲於租界收回市政統一之後，先以個人力之所及，滌遠瑕穢，然後再延請諸位先生共同討論復興建設，因此預定國府還都四週年紀念之日，召集市政諮詢委員會，蓋預定是日以前，實行禁賭與計劃禁烟。這一點前次曾在談話會時，約略向睹位先生報吿。第二個原因，收回租界在外交上有許多經過的手續，如接收時的換文，收回後的組織，這些手續，有些是臨時的，有些時過渡的，需要相當時日，才可完成。例如公共租界初則名爲第一區，法租界初則名爲第八區，以前兩租界的警察機關，也分爲第一警察和第三警察兩局，直到本年二月才先後分別合併。這些手續或是外交的關係，或是事實的關係，先把手續完成後，並次第加以調整，然後才開這個諮詢委員會，使得一般事業，得以順遂進行。現在上海市行政可以吿統一了，而且一切接收租界後的手續也已完成和改正了，今後我們正可以綫密討論，共策進行。至於本人就任市長，自民國二十九年十一月二十日起至今日止，已三年有半，各局處的工作，已印就書面報吿，諸位先生可以按其成就，加以批評，將來予以指敎。今日本人所欲言者，日前上海最迫切問題，　爲經濟問題，上海能够　成世界一個大都市，就在於經濟，經濟問題一日不能解決，即是上海一殺問題不能解決，換一句話，有經濟則有上海，無經濟則無上海，其他一切問題，　爲枝葉，而經濟問題，才是根本，我們也知道，平時的上海所靠者爲物資的集散和生產，戰時的上海物資集散，雖不能如平時圓滑，而生產則決不能使之少停，自大東亞戰爭以來，增强生產，爲朝野一致所注目，可是返　上海的生產，甚至全國，不但減少，且見停頓，這一屬，深望諸位予以研究。</p>
<p>我也知道，社會對於市府過去有許多善意批評，本人拘着賣無旁貸之旨，均採納嘉言，深自　覺，凡在責任以內者，無不悉力自勉，即非責任以內者。亦深自內省。蓋以本人之地位，不祇爲上海一市之長，並且負中央一部份任務，雖然知道社會批評因期望過切，有時過甚甚詞，然旣爲中央和地方負責之一人，責之所在，不客諉卸，賣之在我者，固自憬惕，責不在我者，亦抱言者無罪，聞者是戒之旨，以後深望諸位先生，對於個人之職守，盡量直言。毋容代諱。其次關於本市行政方面對於木市區城行將重爲合理的劃分，對於人事問題，正在計劃裁員加薪，使各機關更加簡單强化，務使上海在無事之時，一般行政配合着復興與建設進行，即在緊急之時，上海治安亦得以確保，此爲本人所理想而希望諸位先生予以援助者。</p>
<p>諸位先生與本人，平日爲畏友，在今日爲同事，諸請委員的性質與普通民意　關不同，普通民意機關形式上多少和政府對立，而請詢委員則在實質上和政府一體，一面可以代達民意，一面可以協助政府，亦即本人之顧問，亦即本人之良友與諍友。諸位先生雖爲上海市政府的諸詢委員，以諸位先生的黃望而論，以上海的地位而論，實不啻爲中國地與人的重心，因此諸位先生無論對於一市的行政，甚至關於全國的經濟和其他問題，均請知無不言，言無不盡，更希望不祗盡言，並希望共同進行，而本人亦惟有知無不行，行無不力，縱力有不逮，亦當契而不舍，彼此互相砥　，本人必信上海可以復興，上海復興則中國亦可復興，此爲本人之信念，而期望諸位先生指敎，並與諸位先生共勉者也。</p>

<h3>出席諮詢會雜感</h3>
<p>— 陳彬</p>
<p>本人自問菲材，此次謬膺市府當局聘爲諮詢委員，無任惶悚。昨日出席首次會議，於暢　當局曁與會諸公談論歸來，略誌雜感，以抒所懷：</p>
<p>我始終覺得，上海的一切問題，凡是住居上海的市民，都有共同責任。有了這種責任感，才能產生市民意見的力量。關於諮詢委員會成立的意義及其性質，市長已經詳細說明，不再贅述。</p>
<p>諮詢委員會的任務，其初由起草委員商定原則草案爲：「諮詢委員會並非正式民意機關，其任務，一方面備市政當局諮詢，一方面協助市政當局推行政令。同時，博採市民輿情，向市政當局建議。必要時，對於市政關係機關提出調查或質詢。經言次會議修芷爲：諮詢委員會之任務，一方面備市政當局諮詢；一方面博採市民輿情，向市政常局建議。但在會議臨終時。陳市長鄭重聲明，文字雖加修正，但在個人立塲，仍希望在座同人，對市政有關問題，歡迎隨時提出調查或質詢，市政措施一切都可公開。這種態度，是政浩家的光明態度，在近二三年來政治上極爲罕覓，這是値得稱道的。我覺得市政前途的曙光就在於此。</p>
<p>諮詢委員中，馮炳南先生自二十六年以後，因爲體力稍差，從未出席任何集會，此次關心地方事業，準時出席。錢業界　袡裴雲卿先生惠病三月，此次亦爲第一次出席會議。證明兩先生對於地方問題的關心與責任感。一般專求個人發財不顧公益者，應知猛覺。</p>
<p>我新聞界同業，曾到塲要求旁聽。熟忱可見。但因會塲狹窄，事前禾能預備席次，臨時無法安　，常局表示歉意。但會議情形及決定原則，都由宜傳處整理委開發表了。</p>
<h3>本市青少年代表　昨集合晉京</h3>
<p>參加首都舉行全國靑少年總檢閱之本市靑少年代表一一四名，昨（一）晨八時集合，由總領隊吳鵬飛率領，搭乘早車晋京，準備參加今日之露營式。</p>
<h3>市民殷盼當局　迅發購布證　早日開始普遍配售</h3>
<p>關於本市臨時配給棉布事宜，自經商統會印就購布證，幷指定零售棉布商承售配布號碼，按照戶口米配給辦法，配給棉布，現一切手續均已辦理完竣，原可早日普遍開始配晋，據記者向布號業聯營處探悉，現購布證商統會已根據市府統計全市人口數目面送市府轉發各區保甲處，按照戶口分發，一俟各區當局將購布證按戶發給完竣後，即可定期普遍配售，故一般市民股盼此項購布　早日發給，以便領配。</p>
<h3>第一警局　捕殺野狗</h3>
<p>第一警察局當局邇來鑑於野犬橫行，受害者爲數不少，今爲維護行路安全起見，擬與軍警當局協力，自本月二日起至十一日止，計十日間，每日午前六時至八時，於提藍橋分局管內施行捕殺野狗，凡無主野狗及無犬牌者，一律視爲野犬，而予以捕殺。再雖有犬牌而無口套者，則予以捕獲。</p>

<h3>改善發給配給證　一點補充意見</h3>
<p>— 朱淵</p>
<p>上月二十日本增刊有海書君所述之續請舊人區改善發給配給證辦法一文，觀後以為海　君尚只以領米票這辦法未能滿意而欲論請改進，而未知移動者家庭之退票與補發及申請書購買時均麻煩異常，尤其一般市民米曾經手過者，既無詳細之佈告，又無訊問處設立，因此一點未　手續成未合符者，而往來奔走。</p>
<p>例如某家之小孩生後，其家屬須請求補發配給票，因保申股出生之報告　向無存根留給作證，以致申請須由聯保處證明，如其證明書只有聯保　章無聯保長私人印　者，或全印　而用普通之紙張者，均須再跑一遍。而每次入內，均須和申請者，退票者，補票者同一門口而入，而人口均需排除，以致入內一次需得排二三小時之隊，排於露天之　塲中之領配給證者，晴天日晒，雨天雨淋，使領票人如此麻煩復雜，均感莫大困苦。茲以數點希望改進之意見，陳述如下：</p>
<p>領聯票者　如退票者買申請書者及補領者各設一門出入，或由沿入口大門旁之窗口處設立辦公桌，而使領取者無須回人一門，否則亦應排定時澡，各不相　。</p>
<p>曠塲領票人排隊處設製遮蔽物，以使雨天及暴日之下，不致直接侵及領票人身上，而且此後天氣漸熱，於點日中長時間之曬臨頭上，必使身弱之人昏暈，而風爾中站立，衣衫貼背，極易患病。</p>
<p>設立訊問處，以專爲解答領配給票人疑問而設，在領票人苦無解答詳吿辦法和手續時，唯有　問辦事員，而辦事人員過於忙碌，而回答不能淸楚，致使領票者知錯而不知怎樣改正，及錯後再錯。寃枉奔跑者屢見之。</p>
<p>門口及門外應詳細佈吿領票人之手續，今日領票應爲何處居民。</p>
<p>以上數項，可以說最低希望之須改進點，如當局能體騐領票者之因苦者，想必能容納無疑。</p>

<p>— 岩田雄　洪洋譯</p>
<p>修羅（一）</p>
<p>「哈哈！」原這樣大聲笑出來。</p>
<p>「既然如此，你無論什麼都不喜歡　了吧……靑年聽到這樣話，不覺吃了一驚。</p>
<p>（是的，是完全這樣的。對於我，簡　沒有要　的東西了。）</p>
<p>他默默無言。</p>
<p>「那，你是神經衰弱呀！再喝一杯酒吧！」</p>
<p>鶴原舉起酒瓶來，這位靑年也就慢慢地把酒杯　過去．</p>
<p>「自然，對於畫家來說，一生總有一次危機會來襲的。看着自己過去所作的事情，一切都成了空，於是感覺到任何東西都討厭。看到畫界也是生厭的。但那種經騐，却是畫畫有了十年或十五年歷史以後的事。像你這樣年靑，有絕頂的聽明和天才，是我很知道的，但巳經發生了危機，我倒不認爲你是對於畫畫有了相當歷史所致。所以你是神經衰弱，只是神經衰弱。」鶴原在長篇大論地分析着。</p>
<p>「或許是那樣。」這位靑年輕輕地回答了一句，然而在他的心坎上，却認爲畫家的危機也好，神經袞弱也好，都無多大關係。但，只覺得脚底下的地布發滑，心中非常不安和焦急，總想要　於逃開這個地方。</p>
<p>「或許一面作事，一面學畫，總不免過於辛苦。」鶴原稍微加一點安慰。這位靑年和鶴原是不問的，因爲是半工而半學畫。他是在銀座大馬路上某大化妝公司的宣傳科裏服務着。</p>
<p>「或許是那樣。」他未加思索地這樣回答了一句。</p>
<p>談話因為已經離了題，所以鶴原就把香烟放在衣袋裏，而說：「這還要吃麼？」</p>
<p>「不，我已經够了。」</p>

<p>「謝謝你，請吃飯。」那位靑年一出飯館，就這道謝着。</p>
<p>「沒有的話。那末我就要失陪了。還請來玩。再就是關於治療神經敎弱，應當請假到山上或海邊去畫盡，你看怎樣？」鶴原這標說完，立刻就向着車站方面走去。因爲他在車站的南面住宅區內，有一所小的晝室。而那位靑年，却是在另一個方面，而住在很不考究的公寓裏。</p>

<h3>Requesting Government Incentives for Agricultural Production</h3>
<p>Since the 26th year of the Republic [1937], much farmland in rural areas has been left uncultivated. Although there are no comprehensive and accurate statistics on the total area of cultivated land, according to partial surveys by various economic organizations, there has been a considerable decrease compared to before the 26th year of the Republic. This situation has not yet returned to its original state. From the perspective of increasing production, this is of course an urgent matter that needs to be addressed. However, in recent years, comparing the types of crops, rice ranks first, wheat ranks second, and then cotton. Before the 26th year of the Republic, the area planted with cotton was greater than that planted with flour, the opposite of the current situation. The main reason for this is that grain prices have risen sharply in recent years, making rice cultivation more profitable than cotton cultivation. This trend is a natural result.</p>
<p>However, since the implementation of grain control, farmers have felt that the purchase price is too low, coupled with the malfeasance of the purchasing personnel who oppress them, making it unprofitable for them. As a result, they have gradually adopted a negative attitude towards planting grain.</p>
<p>However, the former change from planting cotton to planting rice can still be seen as an adaptation to needs from the perspective of the grain problem. There is still something to be gained. The latter, from the perspective of increasing food production, is a very serious problem. If measures are not taken to remedy it urgently, a fundamental crisis in the food problem will occur. The impact will be far from being made up for by empty words, and it will be impossible to save it in the short term.</p>
<p>According to actual field reports and observations, in recent weeks, during the time when farmers are planting rice, their psychology is generally hesitant. Planting rice, they feel oppressed by the low purchase price and cannot muster any interest. Planting cotton, they fear they will not be able to solve the food problem for themselves and their families. After experiencing pain, they are torn between conflicting choices, which may lead to two results. The first is to reduce the area planted with rice to avoid the discomfort of low-price purchases. The second is that even if they plant rice, they will adopt a passive attitude, unwilling to work diligently, only producing enough for themselves and their families, and not bothering to work hard, which is tantamount to doing it for nothing. Both of these results create a serious crisis of reduced food production. This year is the year of increased production proposed by the government, but isn't this going in the opposite direction? In fact, the production of flour and food is already insufficient to maintain the previous amount. If there is a further trend of reduced production, the insufficiency will be even greater. Wouldn't this be heading towards self-destruction?</p>
<p>Therefore, whether from a theoretical or practical standpoint, we believe that the current period of farmer hesitation in choosing crops is the most critical opportunity for the government authorities to guide them to the right path. If appropriate guidance is not given, the opportunity will be lost, and it will be too late to save the situation. It is like eating a chicken or eating eggs, which is more beneficial? If you want to eat eggs permanently, you must protect the health of the hen. If you want to eat the chicken and kill it, then there will be no way to get eggs. If you want to eat the chicken and kill it and still want to eat eggs permanently, it is impossible. We believe that rather than killing the chicken to eat it once and not being able to eat eggs permanently, it is better to eat eggs permanently and keep the hen alive. Therefore, we propose:</p>
<p>First, we request the government authorities to promptly order military organs to instruct all units in all regions to prohibit direct purchases of grain from farmers, and to issue a notice to the people to make this known. The military's grain can be collected and distributed uniformly by unified organs at reasonable prices. At the same time, we hope that the Allied military authorities will fully assist and also issue an order to prohibit similar direct purchases. This will reduce the threat and panic experienced by farmers in their minds.</p>
<p>Second, the necessary amount of grain purchased must be calculated based on the costs incurred by the farmers. The calculation should include the labor portion of the farmers and provide some profit to ensure they can realistically benefit. This will reduce the biggest emotional blow to farmers.</p>
<p>Third, the method of controlling grain has been implemented for several years, and it is undeniable that it has failed and is not in line with the current environment. Recently, valuable opinions from experienced people believe that, in addition to purchasing military grain as necessary, calculating the most reasonable price, and adopting the most fair method, entrusting local authorities and local chambers of commerce to directly purchase from farmers, the remaining rice and flour for civilian consumption can be released from control and freely circulated and bought and sold. In view of the painful experience of past control, in view of the current reactionary trend, and even more in view of the serious crisis in the future, this is indeed a point worthy of review and consideration.</p>
<p>The three points mentioned above are the last opportunity for urgent measures, and cannot be delayed. These three points are prerequisites. Only after they are resolved can we talk about increasing production. If we ignore the prerequisites and talk about increasing production, we are simply dreaming.</p>
<h3>Confusion Around Imphal; Brave Japanese and Indian Troops Inflict Heavy Damage on the Enemy; Six Enemy Aircraft Shot Down Near Meiktila</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from a certain base on the Indian front, the main force of the stubborn enemy's 20th Division and a part of the 23rd Division, totaling about 12,000 men, who were defending the deep position east of Imphal, began a full-scale retreat on the night of April 28th. They are currently retreating from various mountain peaks towards the Imphal pass. Currently, enemy retreating troops are seen everywhere around Imphal, and they have fallen into a state of confusion. The elite troops of the Japanese and Indian armies are fiercely attacking these enemy troops, inflicting heavy damage on them. One unit of the Japanese army broke into a corner of Height 4562, 2 kilometers northwest of Dinobal, while another unit circled behind the Sebaum position, fiercely attacking about 3,000 enemy troops between Sebaum, Senani, and Height 4562. These enemy troops possessed 2 15-centimeter howitzers, 8 12-centimeter howitzers, 7 mountain guns, and other mortars. The Japanese army has caused them to collapse and suffer heavy losses. Furthermore, one unit of the Japanese army advanced to Falburn, 10 kilometers west of Imphal, annihilating the stubborn enemy in that area. Another unit of the Japanese army shelled about 1,000 enemy troops on the Tamu-Wagyu road. The Indian National Army is also coordinating with the elite troops of the Japanese army, advancing rapidly, threatening the enemy's retreat route. In short, the operation to annihilate the enemy around Imphal has reached its climax.</p>
<p>Rangoon, 1st (Central News Agency) – On the Burmese front, the Japanese army's fighter squadron intercepted about 30 enemy aircraft that came to attack the vicinity of Meiktila on the morning of the 29th, shooting down one enemy P-24 aircraft and five other types of aircraft. The remaining enemy aircraft fled. The Japanese side suffered no losses.</p>
<h3>Smooth Operations by Japanese and Indian Troops Inflict Heavy Blows on the British Side</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) – Because of the smooth operations of the Japanese and Indian troops in Imphal, they have inflicted heavy blows on the enemy in terms of strategy, economy, and politics. The enemy has not only lost an important strategic stronghold, but the connection between the north and south has also been severed, and the only Bengal-Assam railway in the north is under serious threat. At the same time, the development of the Chungking bloody road has also been halted. Now the initiative in operations and strategy has been seized by the Japanese and Indian troops. In terms of economy, the petroleum produced in the fertile areas of eastern and northern Assam accounts for about 76% of the total production in India, and 300,000 tons of coal are produced annually. The industries in these areas have also been halted due to the smooth progress of the operations of the Japanese and Indian troops. The tea production in the northern plateau area of Kunming will also be halted, and the largest military industry areas, such as the raw material supply areas for coal, manganese, and ore in Bihar and Orissa, are now within the scope of Japanese military action. Therefore, not only can the military production and combat power of India be dealt a fatal blow, but the combat power of the eastern Indian provinces themselves can also be weakened. The anxiety and embarrassment of the British and Americans have been increasingly magnified due to the advance of the Japanese and Indian troops towards Bengal. In terms of politics, the Indian people in the rear are in great confusion because the British and Indian troops have been defeated in all battles and have learned that Jiang Jieshi has formed the Indian National Army. As a result, strikes, slowdowns, and demonstrations are endless, and riots such as tax resistance movements and obstruction of traffic have occurred one after another. They first destroyed the railways, and scattered anti-British leaflets with slogans such as "Long Live Free India" and "Long Live Jiang Jieshi" in the stations and trains of the Assam-Bengal railway. As for strikes and slowdowns, they started in factories and farms. Furthermore, many residents of eastern India are migrating to other places due to strong anti-British sentiments, creating a chaotic phenomenon of social unrest. Indians are scrambling for large quantities of food, which is driving up prices and causing a shortage of materials. It is rumored that the National Congress Party still exists and is engaged in various activities. In order to suppress this, the British authorities have dispatched troops to maintain order. On the other hand, movements against feudalism and the oppression of feudal lords are becoming increasingly active in the native states. In addition, the people are burdened too heavily due to the war, and food is scarce, so the social and political unrest is gradually intensifying. Not only can the British not get financial and military assistance from the native states, but they also feel threatened by the joint front formed by Indians, including British Indians and the native states.</p>
<h3>Reasons for British Failure in Kaladan Area Operations</h3>
<p>Kaladan, 1st (Central News Agency) – The enemy, having suffered a disastrous defeat in the first Arakan campaign, has adopted new and bizarre tactics in Kaladan. They are using African blacks accustomed to forest warfare as the vanguard to reduce the sacrifices of British soldiers, utilizing air transport for ammunition and supplies, and deploying machine guns and mortars in mountainous and treacherous areas, attempting to exhaust the Japanese army with attrition tactics. This is the so-called strategy of Mountbatten and his ilk. However, the swift operations of the Japanese army have left no room for these tactics to be effective, inflicting a devastating blow on the enemy. They are overcoming treacherous roads with new and bizarre artillery, advancing bravely, and inflicting heavy damage on the enemy, causing even the black troops to be terrified. All of this is a manifestation of the excellent strategy of the Japanese army and is worth writing about in detail. The Japanese army primarily eats rice, while the British army's food is mainly wheat, so the production of wheat and rice also has a significant impact on the war situation. It is impossible to produce large quantities of wheat on the narrow plains of the Arakan Mountains and the Bixian Mountains, which stretch for thousands of miles. However, the British army did not consider this at all and still launched an attack on Kaladan, which is one of the reasons for their own failure. Since the beginning of the Arakan campaign, the British army's supply replenishment has relied entirely on air transport, with seven or eight Douglas aircraft flying back and forth every day. However, apart from ammunition, weapons, and British officers, the number of supplies transported for the black soldiers was very small, which caused dissatisfaction and riots among the blacks, and this was also one of the reasons for their failure. Most of the food dropped by the enemy by parachute consisted of bread, Australian dried beef, dried milk, American potatoes, Alaskan salmon, various jams, and tea, all because India had difficulty transporting them. In particular, in the dense forest area of Kaladan, it is necessary to open roads before fighting. The British army found it extremely difficult to open airports and roads, and any that were opened were quickly occupied by the Japanese army with their swift operations. The enemy's main firepower was mortars, but their power was completely lost when they encountered the new artillery of the Japanese army. The Japanese army, which has entered Baretwa, is still advancing through the dense forests of Arakan. The enemy's dense forest tactics will be rendered useless under the swift advance of the Japanese army. At the same time, the Japanese army in southern India and Myanmar will also shine because of the victory in the north.</p>
<h3>Flood Control in Java</h3>
<p>Bandung, 1st (Central News Agency) – The Java Military Administration Department has recently formulated a three-year plan for flood control on the Citarum River, which will be implemented soon. Officials from the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Transportation, and the Priangan Residency have conducted on-site inspections on the 25th. The river is a major river flowing through the Priangan Residency and the Banyumas Residency in western Java. The upper reaches are rare dense forest wetland areas. During the rainy season, the river floods, causing significant damage to the surrounding farmland. More than 20 years ago, local residents requested the Dutch government to build a drainage project, but this has not been realized to this day. A dozen years ago, the local county government completed a 3,000-hectare irrigation and drainage project along the river, but it failed to prevent disasters. Therefore, this time a new plan has been formulated. In the first year, it is planned to complete several hectares of drainage and reclamation projects. After completion, it will not only benefit the residents, but also make a great contribution to increasing food production in Java.</p>
<h3>Inferior Equipment of American Aircraft Proves Material Shortages</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) – Because the United States has suffered excessive aircraft losses, its efforts to increase production have resulted in a situation of shoddy and reckless manufacturing. On March 23rd, during an enemy air raid on Saipan, a bomber was shot down in the northwest sea. After it was salvaged, the shoddy aircraft manufacturing in the United States today could be seen from the aircraft's construction. The flight helmet worn by the deceased pilot could only protect his cheeks, the flight suit he was wearing was tattered and dilapidated, the parachute seemed difficult to open and was made of artificial paper, and there was no food carried in the aircraft, only a few emergency medicines. If even their well-equipped aircraft are like this, it is enough to see the current situation of severe material shortages in the United States. Because they are doing their best to mass produce, the quality of the aircraft is extremely poor. Although their bulletproof glass is still considered strong, the equipment of American aircraft is far inferior to one ten-thousandth of that of Japan.</p>

<h3>Preface to the Reprint of Yoshida Togo's Collection of Essays</h3>
<p>— Chen Bin</p>
<p>The Shenbao published the first collection of Yoshida Togo's essays, 3,000 copies. Within a few months of publication, it was snatched up. From this, we can see the extent to which the general public values Yoshida's essays. Each of Yoshida's articles has a special fervor that is enough to awaken the resonance of every Chinese reader. In particular, it is because he has conducted in-depth and serious research on Chinese issues, understands the crux of the matter, and expresses his opinions, so he can naturally grasp the hearts of the people.</p>
<p>Yoshida's articles are not only loved by Chinese readers, but also by every Japanese friend who truly cares about Sino-Japanese relations and the future of East Asian national unity. Because from his articles, one can more clearly understand China and more correctly understand Sino-Japanese relations and the path that should be taken in the future. Therefore, when the Japanese version of Yoshida's collection of essays was published, it was also snapped up by Japanese people. We deeply feel that, for the sake of China and Japan, articles like Yoshida's are of greater value for more widespread dissemination.</p>
<p>Yoshida's essays have reached the point where they are eagerly read by people from all walks of life in China and Japan. However, he never makes hasty statements. The greater part of his time is spent on scholarship and research. He listens to the opinions of the Chinese people with an open mind and humility, and even accepts opposing criticisms with the same objective spirit and sincerity. We are fortunate that Japan has such a political commentator, and we are even more fortunate to have such an expert and scholar who earnestly studies and promotes Sino-Japanese relations. Although we deeply know that China currently lacks such people, if the authorities on both sides study and adopt Yoshida's essays, it will surely make an even greater contribution.</p>
<p>As Yoshida's supplemented collection of essays is published, we cannot but congratulate Chinese readers. We hope that Yoshida's spirit of diligence, fair attitude, and the great righteousness of his essays can generate a greater impact among Chinese and Japanese people. April 29th.</p>

<h3>Close Relations Between Japan and the Philippines; Economic Cooperation Further Strengthened; Manchukuo Emperor Received Aquino and His Entourage Yesterday</h3>
<p>Manila, 1st (Central News Agency) – The reconstruction of the Philippines after the war, after six months of efforts since independence, is becoming increasingly consolidated. Since the visit of the delegation led by National Assembly Speaker Aquino to Japan, the relationship between Japan and the Philippines has become even closer. Ambassador Aquino, as the former Vice President of the National Labor Service, has been consistently supporting President Laurel since independence, and can be said to be the Vice President of the new Philippines. The accompanying members, including Chief Justice Yulo of the Supreme Court, Finance Minister Alas, and Vice President Osias of the Labor Service Corps, are all authoritative figures in the new government. As the Information Bureau announced, the delegation represents the Philippine people in expressing their gratitude to Japan for their support of independence, and in observing the posture of Japan under the decisive battle, to learn from it for the reconstruction of the Philippines. The visit of the Speaker and the Finance Minister implies that they will cooperate further on important tasks such as strengthening economic cooperation between Japan and the Philippines and transporting wartime materials to the Philippines in the future. The reorganization of the Labor Service Corps into a single political party, successfully gathering the total power of the nation, is a epoch-making innovation in Philippine politics. In today's wartime, the dissolution of the old political parties and the elimination of political party ideology are necessary for the construction of the new Philippines and the gathering of national power. Based on the above points, the newly formed Labor Service Corps will first engage in instilling the spirit of Eastern culture into the people and launch a vigorous national mobilization movement. At the time of independence, the Service Corps recognized the draft constitution, elected the President and members of Congress, and assumed the great task of giving birth to the new government. Now, to ensure the cooperation of the entire nation with the government, President Laurel has been appointed as the President, and it has been decided to implement a new outline. In the future, under the leadership of Laurel, the Service Corps will be responsible for the ideological guidance of the nation. The newly established Economic Planning Board is the supreme advisory and planning agency for the Philippine economic policy. Its primary goal is to achieve the national emergency policy of food self-sufficiency. Chairman Roxas is an outstanding figure in the Philippine political world and an economic authority. The other members are also heads of various ministries related to the economy or prominent figures in the economic world. Due to the strengthening of its lineup, it has become the highest economic authority in the Philippines. The Planning Board has established a Rice Advisory Committee, chaired by Roxas himself. Policies on rice production and distribution will be established. Roxas, who had previously refused to directly take on work due to ill health, is now boldly taking on the responsibility of the important national policy of food, and his attention and skill in handling it are highly anticipated.</p>
<p>Xinjing, 1st (Central News Agency) – Philippine National Assembly Speaker Aquino, along with Supreme Court Chief Justice Yulo, Finance Minister Alas, Agriculture Minister Alunan, and Executive Secretary Osias, visited the National Founding Shrine and the Loyalty Tower at 9:48 AM on the 1st.

<h3>When Will the Invasion of Europe Be Launched? Various Speculations Abound; Some Believe May Is the Most Suitable Time</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 1st (Central News Agency): The issue of the Second Front is currently causing a great deal of noise, leading to increased tension in the European atmosphere. Currently, both German and Allied forces are striving to prepare for a decisive battle, forming a confrontational situation across the Dover Strait. The British mainland is one of the bases for the invasion of continental Europe, so in the past month, various extraordinary measures have been taken. In addition to prohibiting diplomats from entering and leaving, the departure of the general public was also banned on the evening of the 27th of last month, resulting in a state of blockade. The purpose of this move is to distract the German forces, causing them to misjudge the situation, and to achieve the effect of psychological warfare. It also shows that the Allied forces are determined to launch a Second Front. Regarding this matter, a commentator from the London Times stated that, considering the situation in the Dover Strait and the combat season in Western Europe, May would be the most suitable time to launch the Second Front. Furthermore, many reserve aircraft have not yet been deployed, which also poses a difficult problem. The military correspondent of the London Times stated that it is quite difficult to destroy the railways of fortresses and bases. If it were easy, the Italian affair would not be so difficult to resolve.</p>
<p>Ankara, 1st (Central News Agency): ...will continue for some time. Some people are holding contests to guess the date of the invasion of Europe, and are discussing the advantages and disadvantages of landing in the dark of night or under a full moon, unanimously believing that the invasion of Europe is a matter of within a few months.</p>
<h3>Western European Air War Intensifies; German Planes Attack Britain with Gains</h3>

Regarding the American air raids on Berlin, Reuters reports that a large formation of approximately five hundred to seven hundred and fifty American fighter-bombers participated in the bombing. According to German sources, hundreds of American planes reached the airspace above Berlin, and the German air force shot down 129 of them. Furthermore, German aircraft also bombed Plymouth on the southwestern coast of England for about twenty minutes on the night of the 29th, achieving great results. A German heavy bomber squadron also fiercely attacked convoys gathered on the southern coast of England. As the establishment of the Second Front approaches, the air battle over Europe is becoming increasingly fierce.</p>
<h3>Bolivian Coup Fails</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 1st (Central News Agency): Huitong News Agency reports: The Bolivian coup, aimed at overthrowing the Villarroel regime, was originally scheduled to launch yesterday or today, but was thwarted after being betrayed by one of the plotters. As a result, the government announced the implementation of nationwide martial law from the 30th to ensure domestic stability before the general election on July 2nd.</p>
<h3>Construction Department Road Inspection Team Holds Symposium</h3>
<p>The second team of the Construction Department's Road Inspection Group, consisting of five members, completed their inspection of the work of road maintenance team members along the Shanghai-Hangzhou line after passing through Shanghai on the 17th of last month. They returned to Shanghai from Hangzhou a few days ago. Yesterday morning, they convened a discussion meeting with the responsible officials of the road maintenance team members in the city at the Municipal Government Public Works Bureau. There was a sincere discussion on the organization and work guidelines of the road maintenance teams in the city in the future. In the afternoon, the team went to Nanxiang District to inspect the road maintenance team members. It is reported that they will go to Suzhou this morning to participate in a symposium organized by the Central China Railway Company, after which they will return to Nanjing and disband.</p>
<h3>Free Transportation of Paint Within Three Provinces and Two Municipalities</h3>
<p>All types of paint are classified as lacquer and are not included in the scope of controlled goods. In the past, when paint was transported from this city to other locations, it was often detained by inspection personnel in the cleared areas. After inquiring with the Trade Control Association, it was learned that paint belongs to the lacquer category, and there are no explicit restrictions on its transportation within the area of the three provinces and two municipalities, so it can be freely transported. If it is moved from within the three provinces and two municipalities to other regions, approval for removal from the association should be obtained.</p>
<h3>British Navy Night Battle Offshore: Destroyer Sunk</h3>
<p>Berlin, 1st (Central News Agency): German naval sources: A night battle occurred off Saint-Brieuc on the Brittany coast. The Canadian destroyer HMCS Athabaskan was sunk by German torpedo boats. Two German torpedo boats participated in the battle. The enemy had several cruisers and destroyers, which were superior in number and firepower, but they avoided the range of German fire and did not approach to engage. Under heavy fire, an enemy ship was hit. One German ship initially fought actively but eventually left the battlefield due to damage. Another ship continued to fight bravely alone. The enemy ship was soon hit and caught fire, with flames reaching about 200 meters high, possibly due to a torpedo hitting its oil tank. The crew suffered heavy losses, and 85 people were rescued. According to rescued crew members, another enemy destroyer was also hit and sank. Details of the enemy's losses will be released after reviewing the testimonies of the survivors.</p>
<h3>Integration of Research, Education, and Production—The Appearance of Japan's New Industrial University—</h3>
<p>—Tadao Yamamoto</p>
<p>Current Demands</p>
<p>Epoch-making increases in production have promoted students' diligent service. The ideal of education that unifies theory and practice, although deformed, has been realized to some extent. Especially for industrial knowledge, it is not enough to rely solely on abstract understanding; it must be accompanied by practical industrial technology. Moreover, under the current circumstances where national power and war capacity hope for mass production, in addition to the specialized and upward development of various industries, institutions and skills that can implement mass production are also required.</p>
<p>On the other hand, scientific weapons must possess new capabilities that exceed those of enemy countries, and must be produced and used quickly. Therefore, invention and research are particularly important.</p>
<p>Thus, although education, research, and production have related and inseparable relationships, in our country's education and industry sectors, these three are mutually separated and each pursues its own interests. The current situation prompts a correction of this situation. The education sector is undergoing drastic changes due to the relationship between military service and service, and cannot but experience considerable upheaval. Current industrial education must reflect on, plan, and make decisive decisions regarding this situation.</p>
<p>Awakening of the Business World</p>
<p>Under the international capitalist economic structure, during the era of commercial organization's industrial control using the gold standard as a weapon, industrialists operated their businesses with profit as their goal and profitability as their indicator. Especially in our country, due to being late to participate in the world market, the market was restricted, allowing merchants who imported new scientific products to run rampant. Later, pioneering individuals gradually created factory production institutions, and after several trials, progressed to large organizations. However, very few industrial companies had research institutions for their own businesses, and they were unwilling to create original new products through research, instead investing huge amounts of money to obtain patents and manufacturing methods invented by advanced countries. In this era, the academic community could not obtain the convenience of research institutions, and most researchers pursued theoretical teaching to guide the conclusions of engineering.</p>
<p>Since the Manchurian Incident, our country's national situation, politics, and diplomacy have undergone changes. Similarly, it has also promoted the awakening of industrial managers. On one hand, they abandoned the goal of profit and aimed to contribute to national power and war capacity. On the other hand, they did not hesitate to spend heavily on investigation and research, creating a positive trend of striving to create and improve products, and many people also supported students' research.</p>
<p>Two Aspects of Research</p>
<p>There are two aspects to research: basic research and applied research. Basic research uses scientific insight to analyze the constituent elements of phenomena and formulates them into formulas and laws under various conditions. Of course, integrating various elements and unifying them into more general laws is the path to approaching the truth of the natural world.</p>
<p>As for applied research, its mission is to drive and integrate already discovered laws to create practical machines, whose ingenuity can surpass the senses of human organs, and whose strength can replace the manpower of tens of thousands of people. Although humans are the spirit of all things, their mechanical evolution has passed its peak and entered a period of decline, but relying on auxiliary devices produced by labor, they infinitely expand their abilities.</p>
<p>In scientific research, basic research is its mission, because the development of theory has already immersed itself in the realm of philosophical thinking. There are two aspects to the exploration of these philosophical concepts, one is the setting of principles, and the other is to make them applicable to industry. This basic research is called engineering research. Although applied research can also be called industrial research, industrial experiments should be distinguished from this type of research.</p>
<p>Two Aspects of Engineering Education</p>
<p>Engineering education can also be examined from two aspects. Previous engineering education, especially university education, considered basic education to be sufficient. This was considered orthodox and became a habit. As for other methods, there was neither room for consideration nor enthusiasm for consideration.</p>
<p>However, in industrial practice, this type of education was found to be inconvenient and needed to be re-educated. For example, the industrial management department, in addition to engineering education, also added subjects such as law, economics, and management, but this was also intended to improve management efficiency. True industrial technicians should be those who have a deep understanding of factory life in order to conduct research and production in practice.</p>
<p>There are many universities named industrial universities at home and abroad, but apart from basic education based on past ideas and slightly advancing specialized industrial types, there are no special features. A true industrial university should operate research, education, and production in a unified form, integrating research institutes, factories, and university education. There are not a few examples of this in Europe and America.</p>
<p>The Path of the New Industrial University</p>
<p>Recently, Kiyokazu Iwasaki, the head of a radio equipment factory, and his partner technician, Kokichi Hayakawa, have completed their plan, and the government has given considerable encouragement and requested cooperation from all parties to create a new industrial university. That is an industrial university that integrates research, education, and production. Under the new ideal of making studying, researching, and practicing actual life, industrial educators have realized one by one what they had never thought of before and considered impossible.</p>
<p>Thanks to Iwasaki's provision of private funds and factory equipment, an industrial university that integrates applied research, studying, and factory life has been created. The new industrial university that was considered a fantasy among colleagues is about to be realized. This can be seen as a transformation in industrial education brought about by the national circumstances of the decisive battle.</p>
<p>In a comprehensive university, the engineering department, which has undergone a long period of experience, stands in a traditional and classical position. The new single-subject industrial university has completed a new development due to its characteristics. Adapt to the requirements of the country, accelerate our country's industrial education, complete the actual combat power in wartime, and enrich the national power in peacetime.</p>
<p>The ideal of this new industrial university, in addition to those engaged in industrial education. There are many supporters among the heads of large industrial enterprises, who regard it as a development of the highest industrial education in our country. The times have passed Dr. of Engineering, former Director of the Faculty of Science and Engineering of Waseda University, and Principal of the newly established Kugayama Radio Industry Vocational School (Translated by [unclear])</p>

<h3>Municipal Advisory Committee Holds First Meeting Yesterday; Mayor Chen Delivers Speech Explaining Significance and Expressing Expectations</h3>
<p>In order to further promote the municipal construction of Shanghai, the Shanghai Special Municipal Government has specially invited 25 people who are reputable in the city and have a passion for local undertakings, such as Yen Hui-ching, Lee Shih-hao, Wen Lan-ting, Yuan Lu-deng, Lin Kang-hou, Shen Si-liang, Pei Fu-heng, Lee Chuan-shih, Chu Bo-chuan, Chou Tso-min, Chen Pin-he, Jin Xiong-bai, Feng Bing-nan, Wu Yun-zhai, Pei Ling-qing, Xiang Kang-yuan, Wu Zhen-xiu, Dai Ai-lu, Guo Shun, Tang Shou-min, Zhao Zheng-ping, Zhao Jin-xiang, Ren Xiao-shan, Yao Qing-san, and Chen Ri-ping, to form the Municipal Advisory Committee. Yesterday (the 1st), the first plenary meeting of the committee was formally held at 4:00 PM in the meeting room of the First District Public Office. In addition to Mayor Chen and Secretary Wu, the attendees included committee members Lee Shih-hao, Wen Lan-ting, Yuan Lu-deng, Yen Hui-ching, Tang Shou-min, Lin Kang-hou, Wu Ci-qi, Zhao Zheng-ping, Shen Si-liang, Pei Fu-heng, Lee Chuan-shih, Chu Bo-chuan, Chen Pin-he, Jin Xiong-bai, Feng Bing-nan, Pei Fu-xiang, Xiang Kang-yuan, Wu Zhen-xiu, Dai Ai-lu, Guo Shun, Zhao Jin-xiang, Tao Qing-san, and Chen Ri-ping. The directors of various bureaus and offices of the municipal government also attended the meeting. First, Mayor Chen delivered an opening speech, saying:</p>
<p>Mayor Chen's Opening Speech</p>
<p>Gentlemen, today is the date of the first meeting of the Shanghai Special Municipal Municipal Advisory Committee. It is also the first time that responsible members of society formally gather to jointly discuss municipal affairs after the Shanghai Municipal Administration took over the Public Concession and the French Concession, unifying the administration of Shanghai. You gentlemen not only bear the hopes of Shanghai, but also the hopes of China. With your knowledge and experience, your appointment as members of the municipal advisory committee is not only an honor for myself, but also brings endless expectations and excitement to the people of Shanghai and the whole country. I recall that at the beginning of the takeover of the concessions last year, I stated at the People's Representative Assembly that Shanghai must establish a temporary public opinion body. This so-called public opinion body could either restore the past Temporary Council or establish an advisory committee. The reason for the delay in establishing it until now is twofold. The first reason is that since the incident, municipal affairs have not been able to get on track, and social organization and people's lives have been chaotic. I deeply desired to first do my best to clear away the mess after the concessions were taken over and the municipal administration was unified, and then invite you gentlemen to jointly discuss the recovery and construction. Therefore, I scheduled the convening of the Municipal Advisory Committee on the fourth anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital, because it was planned to implement a ban on gambling and plan a ban on opium before that date. I briefly reported this point to you gentlemen at the previous discussion meeting. The second reason is that there were many diplomatic procedures involved in the takeover of the concessions, such as the exchange of documents during the takeover and the organization after the takeover. Some of these procedures were temporary, and some were transitional, requiring a considerable amount of time to complete. For example, the Public Concession was initially called the First District, and the French Concession was initially called the Eighth District. The police agencies of the two concessions were also divided into the First Police Bureau and the Third Police Bureau until they were separately merged in February of this year. These procedures were due to diplomatic relations or factual relations. After completing the procedures first, they were gradually adjusted before opening this advisory committee, so that general affairs could proceed smoothly. Now the administration of Shanghai can be said to be unified, and all the procedures for taking over the concessions have been completed and corrected. From now on, we can discuss closely and jointly plan progress. As for myself, I have been serving as mayor from November 20, 1940, to this day, for three and a half years. The work of various bureaus and offices has been printed into a written report, which you gentlemen can criticize based on its achievements and give guidance in the future. What I want to say today is that the most pressing issue in Shanghai today is the economic problem. Shanghai has been able to become a world-class metropolis because of its economy. If the economic problem cannot be solved for a single day, then the Shanghai problem cannot be solved. In other words, with economy, there is Shanghai; without economy, there is no Shanghai. All other problems are secondary, and the economic problem is the fundamental one. We also know that Shanghai in peacetime relied on the collection and distribution of goods and production. Although the collection and distribution of goods in wartime cannot be as smooth as in peacetime, production must not be allowed to stop even for a moment. Since the Greater East Asia War, increasing production has been the focus of attention for both the government and the public. However, the production in Shanghai, and even the whole country, has not only decreased, but has even come to a standstill. I deeply hope that you will study this matter.</p>
<p>I also know that society has had many well-intentioned criticisms of the municipal government in the past. I have adopted all good words with the intention of being unreservedly responsible, and have been deeply self-aware. I have made every effort to encourage myself in all matters within my responsibility, and have also deeply reflected on myself in matters outside my responsibility. Because of my position, I am not only the mayor of Shanghai, but also bear a part of the central government's mission. Although I know that social criticism is sometimes excessive due to excessive expectations, as one of the persons responsible for the central and local governments, I will not shirk responsibility. I will be vigilant in matters that are my responsibility, and in matters that are not my responsibility, I will adhere to the principle that those who speak are not guilty, and those who listen are warned. In the future, I deeply hope that you gentlemen will speak frankly and without reservation about your personal duties. Secondly, regarding the administrative aspects of the city, we are about to reasonably re-divide the city area, and we are planning to reduce staff and increase salaries in personnel matters, so that the various agencies can be simpler and strengthened. We must ensure that Shanghai's general administration will be coordinated with restoration and construction in times of peace, and that Shanghai's security can be ensured in times of emergency. This is what I ideally hope for and hope that you gentlemen will assist in.</p>
<p>You gentlemen and I are close friends on weekdays and colleagues today. The nature of the consultants is different from ordinary public opinion bodies. Ordinary public opinion bodies are somewhat opposed to the government in form, while consultants are essentially integrated with the government in substance. On the one hand, they can represent public opinion, and on the other hand, they can assist the government. They are also my advisors, my good friends, and my critical friends. Although you gentlemen are consultants to the Shanghai Municipal Government, considering your prestige and considering Shanghai's position, you are no less than the center of gravity of China's land and people. Therefore, please speak frankly and exhaustively on matters related to the administration of a city, and even on economic and other issues related to the whole country. Moreover, I hope that you will not only speak exhaustively, but also jointly proceed. And I will only know everything and do everything, and if my strength is insufficient, I will persevere. We will encourage each other, and I believe that Shanghai can be restored, and if Shanghai is restored, then China can also be restored. This is my belief, and I hope you will guide me, and I will encourage you together.</p>
<p>Determining Principles and Electing Standing Committee Members</p>
<p>Following this, committee members such as Lee Shih-hao, Lin Kang-hou, Chen Pin-he, Feng Bing-nan, and Zhao Zheng-ping expressed their opinions on the organization of the committee. The following five principles were decided: 1. The task of the advisory committee is to provide consultations to the municipal authorities on the one hand, and to broadly collect the sentiments of the citizens and make suggestions to the municipal authorities on the other hand. 2. The number of members of the advisory committee is tentatively set at 25, and 7 to 9 standing committee members are elected. The standing committee members will attend at least twice a week to handle all matters. 3. Committee members are completely obligated. 4. Regular meetings will be convened once a month, and extraordinary meetings may be convened if the mayor has matters for consultation or if one-third or more of the committee members propose it. The office will be located in the First District Public Office, and the staff will be concurrently appointed by the municipal government. 5. Lee Shih-hao, Lin Kang-hou, Xiang Kang-yuan, Wu Yun-zhai, Shen Si-liang, Chen Ri-ping, and Chen Pin-he were elected as the seven standing committee members, and Feng Bing-nan and Chen Pin-he were elected to draft the articles of association. Subsequently, Wen Lan-ting, Lin Kang-hou, Xiang Kang-yuan, and others freely expressed their opinions on important municipal issues. The situation was very harmonious. They especially considered the issue of daily necessities to be of urgent importance, and resolved to establish a sub-committee to be responsible for research and discussion. Lin Kang-hou, Chen Pin-he, Xiang Kang-yuan, Feng Bing-nan, and Jin Xiong-bai were elected as the five committee members. The meeting adjourned at around 6:00 PM.</p>

<h3>申報 Readers' Bursary: Charity Football and Basketball Match Enthusiastically Sponsored by the Sports Community</h3>
<p>To support the seventh annual 申報 Readers' Bursary, our newspaper has decided to hold charity football and basketball matches. This initiative has been met with enthusiastic support from Mayor Chen, Minister Ding, and the sports community. Yesterday afternoon, our newspaper specially hosted the football and basketball committees, inviting Mr. Shen Siliang, Mr. Ma Runfang, Mr. Zheng Wukui, Mr. Pan Sanxing, Mr. Yi Jing, Mr. Zhou Jiaqi, Mr. Le Xiurong, Mr. Ling Xitao, Mr. Feng Jianwei, Mr. Dai Changling, Mr. Zhang Yexiang, Mr. Shen Huichun, Mr. Liang Zhaoan, Mr. Qu Yaokang, and other gentlemen. Our newspaper's President Chen personally hosted them. After close discussion, concrete measures have been agreed upon, and the charity matches are scheduled to be held in mid-May.</p>
<h3>Reflections on Attending the Advisory Committee Meeting</h3>
<p>— Chen Bin</p>
<p>I consider myself to be of meager talent, and I am filled with trepidation to have been appointed as an advisory committee member by the municipal government. Yesterday, I attended the first meeting and, after listening to the free and open discussions of the authorities and fellow attendees, I wish to express my feelings and thoughts:</p>
<p>I have always believed that all citizens residing in Shanghai share a common responsibility for all issues concerning Shanghai. Only with this sense of responsibility can the power of citizen opinion be generated. The meaning and nature of the establishment of the advisory committee have already been explained in detail by the mayor and need not be repeated.</p>
<p>The initial draft principles for the advisory committee's mission, as agreed upon by the drafting committee, were: "The advisory committee is not a formal body of public opinion. Its mission is, on the one hand, to provide consultation to the municipal authorities and, on the other hand, to assist the municipal authorities in implementing administrative orders. At the same time, it widely gathers public opinion and makes suggestions to the municipal authorities. When necessary, it raises investigations or inquiries to municipal-related organizations." This was revised at the subsequent meeting to: "The advisory committee's mission is, on the one hand, to provide consultation to the municipal authorities; and on the other hand, to widely gather public opinion and make suggestions to the municipal authorities." However, at the conclusion of the meeting, Mayor Chen solemnly declared that, although the wording had been amended, he personally still hoped that everyone present would feel free to raise investigations or inquiries regarding municipal issues at any time, and that all municipal measures would be made public. This attitude is a bright attitude of a politician, extremely rare in the political scene of the last two or three years, and it is worthy of praise. I feel that the dawn of Shanghai's future lies in this.</p>
<p>Among the advisory committee members, Mr. Feng Bingnan had not attended any gatherings since 1937 due to slightly diminished physical strength. This time, concerned about local affairs, he attended punctually. Mr. Pei Yunqing, from the financial sector, had been ill for three months, and this was also his first time attending a meeting. This proves the two gentlemen's concern and sense of responsibility for local issues. Those who only seek personal wealth and disregard public welfare should be awakened.</p>
<p>My colleagues in the press requested to attend as observers, which is deeply appreciated. However, due to the limited space in the meeting room, seats could not be prepared in advance, and temporary arrangements were impossible. The authorities expressed their apologies. However, the meeting's proceedings and guiding principles were all compiled and published by the Propaganda Department.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Youth Delegation Assembled Yesterday to Proceed to the Capital</h3>
<p>The 114-member Shanghai youth delegation participating in the National Youth Grand Review held in the capital assembled at 8:00 AM yesterday (May 1st). Led by General Team Leader Wu Pengfei, they boarded an early train to Beijing, preparing to participate in today's camping ceremony.</p>
<h3>Citizens Eagerly Await Authorities to Swiftly Issue Cloth Purchase Certificates and Commence Universal Rationing Soon</h3>
<p>Regarding the temporary cotton cloth rationing in Shanghai, since the Commercial and Trade Association printed cloth purchase certificates and designated retailers to distribute the cloth based on household registration and rice rationing methods, all procedures have been completed. Universal rationing could have commenced earlier. According to reporters' inquiries with the United Cotton Cloth Dealers Association, the Commercial and Trade Association has already submitted the cloth purchase certificates to the municipal government based on the city's population statistics for distribution to district and neighborhood offices, which will then distribute them to households based on registration. Once the district authorities have issued the purchase certificates to households, universal rationing can begin on a scheduled date. Therefore, the general public eagerly awaits the prompt issuance of these purchase certificates so that they can receive their cloth ration.</p>
<h3>First Police Precinct Captures and Kills Stray Dogs</h3>
<p>The First Police Precinct authorities have recently noted the prevalence of stray dogs, with a significant number of victims. To maintain public safety, they plan to cooperate with military and police authorities to conduct a stray dog capture and killing operation in the jurisdiction of the Tilanqiao Branch from May 2nd to 11th, for a total of ten days, daily from 6:00 AM to 8:00 AM. All ownerless stray dogs and those without dog tags will be considered stray dogs and killed. Dogs with tags but without muzzles will be captured.</p>
<h3>Bank of Communications Establishes Agricultural Economy Department</h3>
<p>With the start of spring plowing and the significant need for agricultural capital, the Bank of Communications has established the Shanghai Agricultural Economy Office at its head office on Jing'an Temple Road. It officially opened for business yesterday (May 1st), with Mr. Yechang as the director. The office's business is divided into agricultural, forestry, fishery, and animal husbandry enterprise loans, and rural livelihood improvement loans. Agricultural enterprises, rural cooperatives, and individual tenant farmers can all apply for loans from the office.</p>
<h3>Second Police Precinct Implements Alert Preparedness</h3>
<p>To ensure local safety and maintain治安 within its jurisdiction, the Second Police Precinct has issued orders to all its branches, district medical inspection bureaus, and detective squads to implement heightened alert and preparedness from yesterday until June 1st. The friendly nation's constabulary隊 in the Nanshi District will cooperate. For the overall security of the Nanshi District, a security meeting was convened yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM with the heads of the three Nanshi police stations to discuss close cooperation plans and strengthen the district's police defense capabilities.</p>
<h3>Liquor and Cuisine Banquets No Longer Serve Fruit</h3>
<p>The Liquor and Cuisine Guild has recently decided that, in order to conserve resources, all liquor and cuisine banquets will no longer serve fruit, starting yesterday (May 1st). At the same time, drinking hours will remain as before, with liquor not to be served before 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Children's Library Recruits Book Donation Supporters</h3>
<p>Due to an increase in child readers and an insufficient number of available books, the Shanghai Children's Library held a meeting at the YMCA on Baxianqiao on the day before yesterday. Those in attendance included Lin Kanghou, Yuan Deng, Zhao Jinqing, Ying Yongyu, and others. They decided to hold a book donation campaign with a target of 10,000 books, from May 1st to the 31st. All sectors are welcome to donate generously. At the meeting, Ying Yongyu proposed that the congratulatory gifts for Director Fang Zijun's fiftieth birthday be used for the library's expenses.</p>

<h3>A Supplementary Opinion on Improving the Issuance of Rationing Certificates</h3>
<p>— Zhu Yuan</p>
<p>In the supplement of the 20th of last month, there was an article by Hai Shujun on the continued request for the old district to improve the method of issuing rationing certificates. After reading it, I thought that Hai Shujun was only dissatisfied with the method of receiving rice tickets and wanted to discuss improvements, but did not know that the cancellation and reissuance of tickets and the purchase of application forms for moving families are extremely troublesome. Especially for ordinary citizens who have never handled rice before, there is no detailed announcement or information desk. As a result, those who have not completed the procedures correctly are running back and forth.</p>
<p>For example, after a child is born in a certain family, the family members must request a supplementary ration ticket. Because the report of the birth to the baojia unit does not have a stub left for proof, the application must be certified by the Lianbao office. If the certificate only has the seal of the Lianbao and not the private seal of the Lianbaozhang, or if the entire seal is used on ordinary paper, it must be run again. Each time you enter, you must enter through the same entrance as those who are applying, returning tickets, and reissuing tickets, and the population must be excluded, so it takes two or three hours to queue to enter once. Those who line up in the open square to receive the rationing certificates are exposed to the sun on sunny days and rained on rainy days, which makes it so troublesome and complicated for the ticket recipients that they feel extremely distressed. Here are a few points of hope for improvement, stated as follows:</p>
<p>Those who receive joint tickets, those who return tickets, those who buy application forms, and those who re-receive tickets should each have a separate entrance and exit, or an office desk should be set up at the window next to the entrance gate, so that those who receive tickets do not have to return to the same entrance, otherwise the time of bathing should also be arranged, and there should be no disagreement.</p>
<p>Shelters should be built in the queuing area for ticket collectors in the open space so that rain and暴日 do not directly affect ticket collectors. Moreover, the weather will gradually become hotter after this, and standing in the sun for a long time will inevitably cause weak people to faint. Standing in the wind, clothes clinging to the back, is extremely easy to get sick.</p>
<p>Set up an information desk to answer questions for people who receive ration tickets. When ticket collectors have no way to answer the methods and procedures in detail, they have to ask the clerks, but the clerks are too busy, and the answers are not clear, so the ticket collectors know that they are wrong but do not know how to correct them, and they make mistakes again and again after the mistake. It is common to see those who run around in vain.</p>
<p>Detailed announcements of the procedures for receiving tickets should be made at the entrance and outside the door. Which residents should receive tickets today.</p>
<p>The above few items can be said to be the minimum points that need to be improved. If the authorities can understand the sufferings of the ticket collectors, they will surely be able to accommodate them without doubt.</p>

<h3>Specialized School for Clerical Work Holds Opening Ceremony Yesterday</h3>
<p>In order to meet the needs of the new era and provide guidance on clerical skills, our office has specially established a short-term specialized class for clerical work. The opening ceremony was held at the Mingguo Middle School at 5:00 PM yesterday. It was presided over by the director of our office, Huang Jingwan. More than 150 guests attended, including Liu Bozhi, Zhao Xingjuan, Chen Tianyu, Wang Guifen, Shen Simin, Sun Chizhong, Chen Yisheng, Wu Xiaohou, and Xi Feiyuan. After the formalities, Principal Huang gave a speech, which briefly stated: "Today is Labor Day, and we have gathered young people from all walks of life here for the second time, and we are honored to be able to gather with celebrities and scholars from all walks of life at the opening ceremony of the clerical specialization class. We are currently in a time of material shortage and difficult living, and we should devote ourselves to cultural construction; and the cultivation of practical clerical talents is particularly urgent. Today, there are employees from the industrial and commercial sectors who come to learn in their spare time, which is a rare opportunity, and we should continue to work hard to seek further studies, and not forget to learn from the guidance of guests and practice diligently, so that the cause of our careers will surely be promoted and developed. Today, I would like to propose eight goals:果敢·謹愼·敏捷·正確·勤勉·禮讓·廉潔·　鍊·I would like to encourage all students together.</p>

<h3>Navy</h3>
<p>— Iwata Yu, translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>Shura (1)</p>
<p>"Haha!" He laughed out loud like that.</p>
<p>"Since that's the case, you don't like anything at all, do you..." Upon hearing these words, the youth couldn't help but be taken aback.</p>
<p>(Yes, that's exactly it. For me, there is simply nothing that I want anymore.)</p>
<p>He remained silent.</p>
<p>"Then, you have neurasthenia! Have another drink!"</p>
<p>Tsuruhara raised the bottle, and the youth slowly extended his glass.</p>
<p>"Of course, for a painter, there will always be a crisis that strikes once in their lifetime. Looking at the things they have done in the past, everything becomes empty, and they feel disgusted with everything. Seeing the art world also becomes厭的. But that kind of experience is something that happens after having ten or fifteen years of painting history. Someone as young as you, with extraordinary intelligence and talent, which I know very well, but already experiencing a crisis, I don't think is due to having a considerable history in painting. So you have neurasthenia, simply neurasthenia," Tsuruhara analyzed at length.</p>
<p>"Perhaps that's the case," the youth replied lightly, but in his heart, he felt that whether it was a painter's crisis or neurasthenia, it didn't matter much. He only felt that the ground beneath his feet was slippery, and he felt very uneasy and anxious, always wanting to escape this place.</p>
<p>"Perhaps working on one hand and studying painting on the other is inevitably too tiring," Tsuruhara added a bit of comfort. This youth and Tsuruhara were not related, because he was working part-time and studying painting part-time. He was serving in the publicity department of a large cosmetics company on the Ginza Avenue.</p>
<p>"Perhaps that's the case," he replied without thinking.</p>
<p>Since the conversation had strayed from the topic, Tsuruhara put his cigarette in his pocket and said, "Do you want to eat anymore?"</p>
<p>"No, I've had enough."</p>
<p>"Then, let's take a slow walk!" So the two stood up and paid the bill.</p>
<p>"Thank you for the meal," the youth said as he thanked him as he left the restaurant.</p>
<p>"Don't mention it. Then I'll have to excuse myself. Please come visit again. And about treating neurasthenia, you should take a vacation to the mountains or the seaside to paint to your heart's content, what do you think?" After Tsuruhara said this, he immediately walked towards the station. Because he had a small day studio in the residential area south of the station. But the youth was on the other side, living in a very rudimentary apartment.</p>
