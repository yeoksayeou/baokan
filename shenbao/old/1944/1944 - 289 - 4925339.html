<h3>每一市民須備製身份認辨防空當局規定以防空襲死傷</h3>
<p>本市市民防空本部　警察當局，因查目前本市辦理戶口事宜，尚未十分妥善，加以居民複雜，又受時局影響，因而欲確認居住者身份，洵非易事。雖已普遍發給居住證後，對初期治安工作，已貢獻甚巨，惟其中因年齡關係，有無攜帶居住證之必要者，又有因遺失污損被竊，及不正當攜帶者等情事，致迄今尚無足資確認居住者身份之憑證。則一旦發生空襲時，辨明死傷者或避難者身份之際，其或有忽忙中不及帶出，或燒毀等事，亦在所難免。又有因被害劇烈，寬致無物足資證明身份，而至無法找其家屬證明其姓氏。故經規定每一市民備裂一［身份辨認證］，常時針於一上衣左側前胸內部，二旗袍或褲子上部腰帶或皮帶部份，二襯衫或汗衫胸部左側，並注意避免脫落，俾於一旦不幸事故發生時，救護人員可辨明其姓氏身份，通知家屬或服務機關（其式樣如後）認領。是案已由警察局警防處通令各分局通知保甲，同鄉會，及其他民眾團體，及公司工廠商店及其他各機關，協力督促男女老幼，一律佩戴，以資識別，或將於適當時期實施檢查，以求澈民。辨理斯證，當以白色布為最佳，但亦可利用厚紙，木板等製造，總之祗須記載明瞭，總之祗須記載明瞭，可供為確認身份之根據為原則。同時須注意不使市民遭受額外之負擔，及嚴防奸商乘機橫行，將物料不法抬價，至市民受逼而有所非議，如有是項奸商不法情事發生，當予依法嚴辦。</p>
<h3>加強必勝信念繼續擊滅敵人近藤中將發表談話</h3>
<p>日本駐滬海軍武官長近藤泰一部中將，頃關於台灣東方海戰戰果發表談話，表明決心粉碎敵人制霸東亞之野心，並勗後方奮起增加生產。近藤中將談稱：［日本精銳部隊，自十月十一月以來，在台灣及菲島東方海面，邀擊來襲之敵人，不分晝夜，繼續追擊，戰果逐漸擴大，如大本營前所發表者，吾東亞民族聞悉之餘，莫不與奮，惟傎正之決戰，尚在今後，敵我兩方戰鬥，更將趨於白熱話。吾人在未擊滅敵人最後一艦一機，絕彼等制霸東亞野心之前，決不氣餒，日本聯合艦隊保持堂堂陣容，以絕對自信，加強必勝意志，繼續殲敵，今日我後方民眾，應傾力於增強生產，以各盡職責。大東亞各邦協力，對於今後戰局，必有偉大貢獻，此點深表感激。］又悉：近藤海軍武官長，已本月十五日晋昇為中將。</p>
<h3>實次姜佐宣到滬謀平衡米價</h3>

<h3>向台灣海面航空戰忠勇烈士致敬松島部長昨發表談話</h3>
<p>日駐華艦隊報道部長松島大佐，就十九日由日大本營發表之台灣海面航空戰，對犧牲之勇士，致其甚深之弔意，并對國民希望勿為敵宣傳所惑，斷然向擊滅敵人之途邁進。特發表談話：</p>
<p>讀大本營發表關於本月十二日以來台灣海面航空戰我方積獲偉大戰果，即可想見此次戰果，當爲我精銳聯合艦隊及陸海軍基地航空部隊之獅子奮迅之戰果，以多大之犧牲而克達成者。傾我國力之一半而收獲此大戰果者，無他為予敵以重大損害，故我航空船舶之損害，亦為不得已者，於茲對已犧牲之幾多忠勇義烈之將兵，及軍屬等追思祈念，致其弔意。惟由此一大戰果，對於太平洋戰局之將來，應抱握必勝之信念，始為皇國之新運，我等應再鼓起勇氣，務予最後之決戰，一舉完全殲滅敵人，非自身努力不可。敵雖遭受此次空前未有之大損害，然仍集合附近敗殘部隊，似仍企圖作何蠢動，此為意料中事。然吾人須使其完全殲滅而後己。又根據敵廣播所稱：擬於太平洋印度洋同時一齊妄動，屆時當予以徹底擊滅，國民勿因戰勝而驕，且不可迷惑於小局部之戰局，應以斷乎必勝之信念，全力奮鬥徒事增產，尤對敵之謀略宣傳，須予以甚深之注意。又華南方面敵似仍欲繼續蠢動，惟希望對防空及防止事態上，加以十分注意。</p>

<h3>Every Citizen Must Prepare an Identity Card: Air Defense Authorities Prescribe Measures to Prevent Casualties in Air Raids</h3>
<p>The Air Defense Headquarters of this city's citizens, along with the police authorities, have investigated and found that current household registration matters in this city are not yet fully adequate. Furthermore, the residents are complex, and affected by the current situation, making it difficult to confirm the identities of residents. Although the widespread issuance of residence permits has greatly contributed to initial public security work, there are still issues such as whether it is necessary for those of certain ages to carry residence permits, as well as cases of loss, damage, theft, and improper carrying, resulting in a lack of credentials sufficient to confirm the identity of residents. Therefore, in the event of an air raid, when identifying the dead, wounded, or evacuees, it is inevitable that they may not have time to bring the permits, or they may be burned. Additionally, severe damage may result in a lack of items sufficient to prove identity, making it impossible to find their family members to confirm their names. Therefore, it has been prescribed that every citizen prepare an "Identity Card," to be sewn onto the inside of the left front chest of an upper garment, or onto the waistband or belt of a qipao or trousers, or onto the left side of the chest of a shirt or undershirt, paying attention to prevent it from falling off. In the event of an unfortunate accident, rescue personnel can identify their name and identity, and notify family members or work units (the format is shown below) for recognition. This case has been communicated by the Police Department's Police Defense Division to all sub-bureaus to notify Baojia, hometown associations, and other public organizations, as well as companies, factories, shops, and other agencies, to cooperate in urging men, women, old, and young to wear them uniformly for identification, and inspections will be carried out at appropriate times to thoroughly inform the public. It is best to use white cloth for this card, but thick paper, wood, or other materials can also be used for manufacturing. In short, it is only necessary to record clearly, and in short, it is only necessary to record clearly, so that it can serve as a basis for confirming identity. At the same time, it is necessary to pay attention to prevent citizens from suffering additional burdens, and to strictly prevent unscrupulous merchants from taking the opportunity to run rampant and illegally raise the price of materials, causing citizens to be coerced and criticize. If such unscrupulous business practices occur, they should be severely dealt with according to the law.</p>
<h3>Strengthen the Belief in Certain Victory and Continue to Destroy the Enemy: Lieutenant General Kondo Issues a Statement</h3>
<p>Lieutenant General Kondo Yasuo, the Japanese Naval Attaché in Shanghai, recently issued a statement regarding the results of the naval battle east of Taiwan, expressing his determination to crush the enemy's ambition to dominate East Asia and urging the rear to rise up and increase production. Lieutenant General Kondo stated: "Since October and November, the elite Japanese forces have been intercepting the attacking enemy on the sea east of Taiwan and the Philippines, continuing to pursue them day and night. The results of the battle are gradually expanding. As announced by the headquarters before, the people of our East Asian nations are all inspired. However, the real decisive battle is yet to come, and the battle between the enemy and us will become even more heated. We will never be discouraged until we destroy the enemy's last ship and aircraft and crush their ambition to dominate East Asia. The Japanese Combined Fleet maintains a grand formation, strengthening the will to win with absolute confidence and continuing to annihilate the enemy. Today, the people in our rear should devote themselves to increasing production and fulfilling their responsibilities. Cooperation among the nations of Greater East Asia will make a great contribution to the future war situation, for which I express my deep gratitude." It is also learned that Naval Attaché Kondo was promoted to Lieutenant General on the 15th of this month.</p>
<h3>Jiang Zuoxuan Arrives in Shanghai to Seek to Balance Rice Prices</h3>
<p>Recently, the price of goods in this city has been deeply affected by the black market price of rice, causing great anxiety for the general public. The municipal government attaches great importance to this matter. In addition to Mayor Chen ordering the Goods Allocation Office to find ways to allocate household rice on schedule, the Economic Bureau also telegraphed the Ministry of Industry to find ways to suppress rice prices in order to balance the prices of various goods. It is learned that Jiang Zuoxuan, Vice Minister of Industry, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. He inquired in detail from the municipal government's main commodity control agencies about the current household allocation of food related to people's livelihood and requested that they find ways to increase the allocation quantity to supplement the shortage of food for the people. At the same time, he urged the enrichment of household rice allocation and studied countermeasures to suppress the black market rice price.</p>
<h3>Paying Respect to the Loyal Martyrs of the Air Battle Over the Sea of Taiwan: Minister Matsushima Issued a Statement Yesterday</h3>
<p>Colonel Matsushima, the Press Officer of the Japanese Fleet in China, expressed his deep condolences to the sacrificed warriors in the air battle over the Sea of Taiwan, which was announced by the Japanese General Headquarters on the 19th. He also hoped that the people would not be misled by enemy propaganda and would resolutely move towards the path of annihilating the enemy. He issued the following statement:</p>
<p>Reading the announcement from the General Headquarters regarding the great results achieved by our side in the air battle over the Sea of Taiwan since the 12th of this month, one can imagine that this achievement was the result of the valiant efforts of our elite Combined Fleet and the naval and army air force base units, achieved at great sacrifice. Investing half of our national power to achieve this great victory is nothing but to inflict significant damage on the enemy. Therefore, the damage to our aircraft and ships is also unavoidable. Here, we remember and pray for the many loyal and righteous soldiers and military personnel who have sacrificed themselves, and express our condolences. However, with this great victory, we should hold firm to the belief in certain victory for the future of the Pacific War, which is the new fortune of our empire. We should once again muster our courage and strive for the final decisive battle, completely annihilating the enemy in one fell swoop, which requires our own efforts. Although the enemy has suffered unprecedented losses, they are still gathering nearby defeated troops and seem to be attempting some foolish actions, which is to be expected. However, we must completely annihilate them before we can stop. Furthermore, according to enemy broadcasts, they intend to launch simultaneous reckless actions in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. When that time comes, we will thoroughly destroy them. The people must not be arrogant because of victory, and must not be confused by small local battles. They should fight with all their might with a firm belief in certain victory, devote themselves to increasing production, and pay close attention to the enemy's schemes and propaganda. In addition, the enemy seems to be continuing to act foolishly in the South China area, but it is hoped that sufficient attention will be paid to air defense and the prevention of incidents.</p>
<h3>Memorial Service for Mr. Mitsuru Toyama to be Held on the 22nd</h3>
<p>Mr. Mitsuru Toyama, a friend of the Chinese Revolution, passed away, and upon hearing the news, both the government and the public in our country deeply mourned. In order to commemorate Mr. Toyama's life and express our condolences, a memorial service will be held on the morning of the 22nd of this month in the capital and throughout the country. In Shanghai, the Municipal Government Secretariat, the Municipal Party Department Propaganda Office, the East Asia League, and other organizations have formed a preparatory committee to organize and host the event. Yesterday (the 19th), a preparatory meeting was held at the Municipal Party Department, and it was decided that the memorial service would be held at the Jade Buddha Temple on the 23rd. As time is pressing, preparations are being stepped up.</p>
<h3>National Government Awards Deputy Director Lu a Tongguang Medal</h3>
<p>Lu Ying, Deputy Director of the Shanghai Police Department, has recently been awarded the Second Class Tongguang Medal by the National Government in recognition of his meritorious service. Mr. Lu has sent personnel to Beijing to receive the award.</p>
<h3>The Armband of the Economic Police of the Former Second Bureau is Abolished</h3>
<p>Since the administrative merger of the former First and Second Police Bureaus in this city, the economic police of the former Second Police Bureau have also been merged into the Economic Security Office. The armbands with white background and red characters of "Economic Police" issued by the former Second Bureau have also been explicitly cancelled and abolished. However, it has been found that some sub-bureaus of the former Second Bureau are still using these armbands, causing confusion with the purple and yellow Economic Police armbands issued by the Economic Security Office, which is inappropriate. Therefore, the bureau has reiterated the previous order, ordering that they be abolished and that no one may use them. Those who do so will be subject to investigation. The Economic Security Office is responsible for handling all economic security affairs in the city, with a total of one Economic Police Brigade and five detachments. The First Detachment is located in the General Bureau, the Second Detachment is located in the Taishan Sub-bureau, the Third Detachment is located in the Zhonghuashan Road Sub-bureau, and the Fifth Detachment is located in the Hongkou Sub-bureau.</p>
<h3>Economic Advisor to the League of Nations Answers Questions on Economic and Price Issues: China and Japan Must Cooperate to Increase Production</h3>
<p>Mr. Yuuki, the economic advisor to the League of Nations Cabinet, came to Shanghai from Beijing a few days ago. On the morning of the 17th, he met with the Chinese Press Corps of this city at the Hua Hotel on the ninth floor and expressed his thoughts on coming to China. Due to time constraints, he was unable to answer the various questions raised by the Press Corps on the spot. The following is an excerpt from his written answers: (Question) What are your views on China's countermeasures to increase production? (Answer) Increasing production is the basic issue of economic revitalization, so China and Japan must help each other and cooperate to increase production. The National Government is currently planning various measures to increase production, and Japan is also working to provide raw materials and improve transportation. Therefore, I firmly believe that the effect of increased production will gradually be achieved in the future. (Question) What are Mr. Yuuki's opinions on the soaring prices in Central China? (Answer) A certain degree of price increase is unavoidable during wartime, but if speculative hoarding and other economic disrupting behaviors can be suppressed, then the increase will not cause the people to feel too much pain. Therefore, in addition to various countermeasures, special efforts must be made in this regard. (Question) What is the purpose of your visit to China? (Answer) The purpose of this visit to China is to personally experience the actual situation in China and have the opportunity to exchange views with influential leaders from all walks of life. (Question) What are your impressions after inspecting China's economy and industry? (Answer) I have not seen and heard much since coming to China, and I have not yet formed a comprehensive impression. (Question) What new plans does your country have for further cooperation on China's economic issues in the future? (Answer) I believe that in addition to promoting the policies that have been contributed in the past as much as possible, it is necessary to adapt to the situation and consider expedient measures, which is most appropriate. As for new plans, I have not heard of any.</p>
<h3>Improve Judicial Administration and Expedite Case Handling: Chief Prosecutor Zhao Issues a Statement</h3>
<p>Zhao Zhengtang, the Chief Prosecutor of the Shanghai Local Procuratorate, is determined to work hard to improve the command. Recently, he has been implementing further reforms in accordance with the instructions of the Ministry. A reporter interviewed Mr. Zhao on this matter, and according to him: "This Procuratorate strives for simplicity in handling general investigation cases, especially those transferred from the Police Bureau. Upon receipt, the cases are immediately interrogated. If the evidence is clear and the defendant admits to the crime, the case is disposed of in court, and the indictment is also served in court. If the circumstances are minor, the defendant is released on bail in court. At the same time, they are informed to voluntarily surrender to the Criminal Court of the Shanghai Local Court to await trial. To avoid misunderstandings by the defendant, a surrender order is issued, stating the date, time, and place of surrender. For defendants whose circumstances are more serious and who need to be detained, the handling police officer immediately presents the indictment to the Criminal Court. For these indicted cases, regardless of whether the defendant is in custody or on bail, the case files are organized on the day after the court hearing, and the indictment is sent to the Criminal Court on the third day. Cases where the suspicion of a crime is insufficient are also disposed of in court, and the non-prosecution decision is served to the defendant in court, and they are immediately released. Except for cases where the testimony of witnesses is incomplete or there are still necessary matters to be investigated that cannot be concluded on the same day, all cases must be completed within the day they are received, and efforts must be made to ensure that cases are not delayed for a moment and that defendants do not suffer the pain of imprisonment. This Procuratorate's improved case handling method has been assisted by the police authorities, and it is very convenient that cases can be delivered before 10:00 am every day, which greatly facilitates the speed of case handling. I am extremely grateful. As for the cases applied for detention by the various police sub-bureaus to this Procuratorate, the detention period is sometimes arbitrarily extended, which is not without shortcomings in protecting human rights. I sincerely hope that the police authorities will take steps to improve this. As for the Shanghai Team of Judicial Administrative Police, which was originally concurrently headed by me, has recently been thoroughly reorganized. All judicial police and office personnel have been subject to stricter screening, and those with poor character have been dismissed. The internal organization has also been changed under orders, and the judicial police team is directly under the Procuratorate. The team leader is still concurrently held by me, and the deputy team leader is temporarily concurrently held by the chief prosecutor. Recently, a judicial police training class will be established to recruit new students and provide them with training, so that every judicial police officer can be faithful to their duties and abide by the law."</p>
<h3>The Limit for Postal Remittances Between Shanghai and Ningbo is Increased</h3>
<p>In order to develop the remittance business and facilitate the public, the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau has increased the postal remittance limit between here and Post County (Ningbo) from 20,000 yuan to 50,000 yuan from the 16th of this month. Both telegraphic and postal remittances can be exchanged according to the limit, and can be exchanged upon arrival. It is also heard that the remittance fee set by the bureau for Post County is lower than the market price. [Exemption] Measures for Exemption of Transit Tax Have Been Communicated to North China</p>
<p>According to a report from the Customs Administration to the General Office of Customs, regarding the exemption of transit tax for goods that have already paid the consolidated tax, tobacco and alcohol tax, or mineral tax, the Customs Administration has submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance to forward it to the Executive Yuan to inform the North China Political Affairs Commission to instruct its subordinates to comply. The Ministry of Finance has forwarded the request to the Executive Yuan to inform the North China Political Affairs Commission to instruct its subordinates to comply, and issued an order to the Customs Administration on July 6 of this year to inform them and to hope that all relevant merchants will be informed.</p>
<h3>This Period's Household Rice Will Be Sold Universally Starting Tomorrow, With the Former First District Starting First</h3>
<p>The household rice in this city has been approved by the Municipal Goods Allocation Office and will be sold from tomorrow (the 21st) to the 30th of this month, starting with the former First District. All citizens in the district can purchase indica rice, brown rice, or glutinous rice with the No. 23 Comprehensive Allocation Certificate, with each certificate allowing the purchase of two liters. Household cooking oil for this period will be sold starting today, based on the No. 24 Comprehensive Joint Ticket.
