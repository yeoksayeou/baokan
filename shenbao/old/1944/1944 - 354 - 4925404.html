<h3>日特攻及航空隊轟炸菲海敵艦船　三日間判明沉毀其廿二艘</h3>
<p>東京二十三日中央社電　日大本營二十三日下午三時三十分發表：日特別攻擊隊萬朶·石腸·日光·若繡·精華及死義等各飛行隊與其他航空部隊，連日陸續轟炸明多羅島桑霍塞附近及雷伊泰灣等之敵艦船。自二十日迄二十二日之三日間所獲戰果，迄現在判明者，計於桑霍塞附近轟沉擊沉敵運輸船四艘，巡洋艦或驅逐艦二艘，艦型不明者二艘，起火焚燒者計運輸船四艘，巡洋艦一艘，巡洋艦或驅逐艦一艘，艦型不明者二艘，炸毀敵運輸船一艘。於雷伊泰灣炸沉敵運輸船一艘，炸毀敵大型航空母艦一艘，起火焚燒艦型不詳者一艘，於蘇魯海炸沉敵運輸艦一艘，起火焚燒運輸船一艘。</p>
<p>菲律賓前綫日軍某基地二十三日中央社電　日特別攻擊隊之精華飛行隊及新銳戰鬥機隊，二十日晨在明多羅島桑霍塞海面敵運輸船團上空，與敵掩護戰鬥機四十餘架交戰，當擊落其十架（內二架不確實，）並擊沉中型運輸船一艘。</p>
<p>菲律賓日軍某基地二十三日中央社電　日軍航空隊，二十二日夜以戰鬥轟炸聯合大編隊，急襲明多羅島桑霍寒機場，除使其地上機十餘架及物資集積所二處起火外，另一機隊更攻擊該砂綫橋附近，予敵軍以莫大損害，日機隊即安返基地。</p>
<h3>菲律賓戰局　本質無變化　英艦載機襲蘇門答臘</h3>
<p>東京二十三日中央社電　以雷伊泰島爲中心之菲律賓戰局，因敵美軍在明多羅島展開作戰，而呈新形態，然戰局之本質，則無任何變化。敵美之强行在明多羅登陸，其目的在打開雷伊泰之膠着狀態，具體言之，（一）在分散日軍之攻擊力，（二）在設立中型，大型航空基地，敵軍今後因日軍派向明多羅島之航空基地之吸收，將愈益强化，對雷伊泰方面之作戰使其本格化，而期空襲呂宋島，建設明多羅基地，分散雷伊泰島之日軍航空兵力，如此菲律賓戰局已入微妙階段。敵軍對明多羅島之補給，必須　過錯雜之海面，呈露其弱點，且大型機之使用僅限於菲律賓中部以南之地域，日美爲克服此種障碍，必須出以絕大之犧牲。反之，日方則占絕對的優勢，（一）日軍在菲律賓全島布有鐵桶般之基地，（二）日軍補給路綫較敵美自本國輸送爲短，今菲律賓戰局，日軍在阻止敵軍獲得基地，一舉潰滅其決戰主力。此外，馬利亞納及南太平洋方面，均無顯著變化，僅印度洋方面英艦隊艦載機少數，於二十日晚來襲蘇門答臘北端地區，實行微弱之作戰。</p>
<p>新藤相澤兩氏談話</p>
<p>東京二十三日中央社電　在菲律賓方面戰局緊急之際，日陸軍中佐新藤常右門，曾率精强戰鬥機隊，邀擊侵攻該方面之美空軍，對於進攻作戰及運輸掩護，樹有赫赫武動，中佐個人曾受褒狀。</p>
<p>又日軍相澤戰鬥機隊，於馬尼刺灣與雷伊泰作戰建有武功，亦受有部隊　狀，該兩事已達上聞。新藤中佐及相澤戰鬥機隊長相澤寅四郞少佐，二十二日下午與陸軍省記者團會見時，曾談菲律賓方面彼此之實情如下：「來襲菲律賓方面之地方空軍技術雖拙，然防火設備卻甚完善，製造材料亦甚優秀。其戰鬥方式多由四週圍攻少數日機，年齡多爲二十歲左右者。在來襲之際，如有日戰鬥機在其上空，彼等絕不靠近，即使靠近，其投彈情形極爲拙笨。技術優秀者，當推制式空母飛出之艦載轟炸機，其隊長中亦有相當優秀者，然而制式空母被沉不尠，最近似由特製空母飛來。敵艦數十艘來襲桑霍塞時，日軍特攻隊即以一機沉一艦之兌換率攻之，敵艦現三分之二張行登陸，特攻隊爲完成其任務，尙須準備許多掩護機，以排除敵之妨碍，故須多送飛機，猛攻桑霍基。雷伊泰激戰時，因日機數甚多，故制空權全在日軍當中，然在酣戰瞬間，因天氣驟變，補充中斷，頗爲遺憾，設若飛機充足，敵登陸二師或三師不足爲患。在巴打恩半島及老列希多爾敵軍亦曾登陸二三師。」</p>
<h3>襲銘古屋附近　敵機受重創　擊落及被毀逾四十架</h3>
<p>東京二十三日中央社電　日大本營二十三日下午四時發表：二十二日於名古屋附近對敵機邀擊戰，其後判明之戰果如次（包含已發表者）：擊落二十架（內未證實者四架），敵機受有損害者二十架以上，日方自炸未歸還者四架。</p>
<p>東京二十三日中央社電　日本制空部隊，二十二日對來襲名古屋附近之敵B29型機，以陸空一體之態勢，加以壯烈猛攻，擊落其二十架，擊毀其二十架以上，共擊落擊毀來襲敵機數之四成。由日方猛烈攻擊，敵機倉惶盲目投彈，故日方損害極爲輕微，總計十三日，十八日及二十二日，三次來襲名古屋附近之敵機，前後共爲二百五十架，而其中十分之三約八十七架均被擊落或受創，誠爲日制空部隊之壯烈鬥志及其卓越之戰鬥力所獲之戰果也。</p>
<p>東京二十二日中央社電　馬里亞納基地之敵B26型機，曾於二十二日下午一時起，分作數編隊，由高空來襲日本土，其主力係集中于名古屋，同時並分散侵入靜岡，愛知縣及大阪府等地，日制空部隊當即邀擊，而予以重創，至二時半敵始向西方退却，是後之戰果刻正在調查中，日方損失極其輕微。</p>
<h3>緬北渝遠征軍　遭日軍反擊</h3>
<p>北緬前綫二十三日中央社電　渝雲南遠征軍五軍十二師，企圖由龍陵·　市地區沿滇緬公路東西綫逐步南下，十一月再度開始攻勢以來，遭日軍巧妙之反攻，至十一月下旬，死傷達一萬數千名。渝軍於本年五月以來，六個月間，在拉孟·　越·龍陵三地，連次敗北，戰意及戰力急速低下，尤以兵士素質之低劣，乃不可掩蔽之事實，遠征軍陣營不獲後方補給，因之逃亡日增，時有掠奪鑛行等發生，軍紀隨之紊亂。</p>
<h3>日軍對大陸決戰已完成先制態勢</h3>
<p>在菲保持戰略優越地位</p>
<p>中央社訊　日駐華軍與駐華艦隊協力，完成縱貫大陸作戰，以及中國東南海岸肅淸作戰，已獲致煊赫戰績，敵人所遭打擊，與日俱增。此次日軍大陸攻勢，自大的方面言，已將英美渝在東南亞洲之聯繫策應悉予破壞，尤以重慶內部困難益甚，加以因此喪失唯一戰力培養基地之中國東南部，亦即蔣介石所稱「以東南之富養西北之兵」，湖南，廣東，廣西，福建等省地盤，而趨日暮窮途。又美軍認爲攻擊日本墓土，必以登陸中國沿岸爲前提，至此亦無實現希望。緬甸方面敵聯合軍之戰略態勢，亦予以間接的威脅，於渝方言，爲打開目前窘境，唯一生路爲開拓外援路綫，中印路綫因開拓困難，效果亦不能十分期待，是故彼等最大希望，是美軍從太平洋方面向中國沿海岸登陸，美軍在菲島登陸後，彼等即認爲美軍來援已近而表驚喜，然麥克沃塞軍隊在雷伊泰鳥遭日軍猛烈抵抗，無法進展，而日軍於此時期已輕易打通大陸縱貫路，以致更逼使渝方再深入內地。同時，殘留於縱貫路外側之一部份渝軍，陷於孤立無援之狀態，渝軍事委員會機關報「掃蕩報」，於十九日社論中，熱望美軍一俟菲島作戰完了後，再登陸中國沿海岸。該論文曾指出以下數點：（一）日軍目下頻頻加强中國沿岸防務，美軍之在中國大陸登陸延遲一天，則日軍之防備愈嚴，美軍欲驅逐日軍益難，若謂在中國沿岸登陸爲打倒日本之戰略上前提，則吾人必須立即把握時機。（二）日軍於打通大陸縱貫路後，第二步着眼於防備美軍在中國沿岸登陸之對策，日軍刻已從廣西省南寗向海岸進襲，幷已攻取雷州半島西方接近北海之欽縣，同時廣東·福建兩省海岸地區日軍，正在强化立即在沿岸登陸，則中國東南部之重慶軍，必舉手表示協力，即使日軍進入湖南，廣西，但東南部重慶軍無一人落後，該方面重慶軍實爲百戰鍊磨之精銳，天生戰士，總之，美軍在中國沿岸登陸，爲當前急務。（三）一方面蒙特巴頓所率東南亞洲軍，乘此日軍在菲島死戰無寗日之今日，爲以最小努力博最大效果，應立即對馬來方面開始攻擊。吾人讀掃蕩報社論，刻已看你出渝方　於東南諸省之失陷如何表打開雷伊泰島戰事僵局的直接效果，以及接近中國大陸的次要效果。惟美軍在日軍集中强大兵力之菲島實施「跳蛙作戰」，實爲冒險中之冒險行爲，敵美軍事評論家鮑爾溫，曾對美國之冒險行爲，警吿必須忍耐更大之犧牲，實際上美軍即使傾注如何物量，仍不能抵敵菲島日軍在戰略上之優越地位，即以航空兵力言，菲島之日航空兵力，可以壓倒美國，日本始終保持戰略上的優越地位，而大陸方面戰路，亦日益有利於日方，掃蕩報所指美軍及渝軍困難與日俱增的事實，今後更將嚴重。</p>
<h3>日機襲昆明毀大型機六架</h3>
<p>中國基地二十三日中央社電　日轟炸機隊二十一日轟炸昆明飛機塲，另一隊攻擊老河口·安康·贊州，所獲戰果，於昆明飛機場炸毀大型機六架，安康飛機場設施一度爆炸，其他因視綫不佳，未能確認，日機全部安返。</p>
<h3>襲漢渝美機　歸途遭邀擊</h3>
<p>墜毀二十一架</p>
<p>漢口二十三日中央社電　駐渝美空軍，十八日無差別盲炸漢口地區時，經日軍航空部隊及陸上部隊於某歸路邀擊，擊落其B29型機二架，P51型機四架，擊毀其B29型機十二架，P51型機三架，合計收得擊落毀二十一架之大戰果，日方損失計自炸二架。</p>
<h3>違法炸醫院船　日向美抗議</h3>
<p>東京二十三日中央社電　日醫院船十一月二十三日上午八時十五分，在馬尼刺港外圍美戰鬥機及轟炸機不法擊沉，日政府已於十二月二十一日對美政府提出嚴重抗議。按該船於遭難時，曾明白揭識醫院船標識，同時天氣晴朗，視綫良好，斷無誤認之理，且該船以馬尼刺港爲戰鬥區域，乃停泊港外附近，並無其他船舶及軍事目標，美機竟違背國際公法與人道，經該船炸沉。</p>
<h3>盟邦讓渡飛機定期行命名式</h3>
<p>南京二十三日中央社電　自大東亞戰爭以來，中日邦交益臻親密，盟邦軍部當局爲標識熱誠推助起見，特讓渡國府軍委會V1型軍運機兩架，內中一架指定贈送汪故主席夫人專用，藉表追念我最高領袖之熱心，此兩機暫擬定命名爲「和平」號「建國」號，日內將舉行讓渡式及命名式，盟邦代表爲大使館附武官今井少將，我方代表爲軍委會鮑總參謀長。</p>
<h3>昨國防會議　議決要案多件</h3>
<p>南京二十三日中央社電　國防會議本日舉行六十一次會議，決議要案多件，摘錄于后：（一）主席交議秘書處案，呈准法制專門委員會函，奉交審查立法院函送關於審議戰時房屋租賃爭議處理法修正草案，並提供意見三點一案，經邀請院部派員參加共同審查，擬定修正原則四點，請轉陳鑒核等情，請公決案，決議通過，交社會福利部重新修正。（一）主席交議，秘書處案，呈准國民政府文官處函奉府令，兼新運促進會蘇省分會主任委員陳羣，另有任用，應免兼職，並特派任援道兼新運促進會蘇省分會主任委員，請轉陳鑒核追認等情，請公決案，決議通過。（一）主席交議，據監察院摺呈，本院監察使及監察委員尙有缺額，擬請特派葉先圻爲監察使，並請以在曾武爲監察委員，呈請鑒核等情，請公決案，決議通過。（一）主席交議，特派沈爾喬，徐季敦，陳次寶，謝恪，孫鳴岐，洪渚，章駿爲全國經濟委員會委員，請公決案，決議通過。（一）中政會及國防會議秘書長周佛海，因職務繁重辭職，改由趙尊嶽任秘書長，決議通過</p>
<h3>將校團畢業禮　陳團長訓辭　（續完）</h3>
<p>好容易大東亞戰爭開始，日本首先發動求東亞民族的解放，此爲東亞有史以來正義之戰，正是中國解放的良機。於是在汪故主席領導之下，毅然參戰，此非日本之要求，亦非跟隨日本而作戰，乃機會給我們的自衛工作，百年以來淪爲次殖民地之中國，至此才可透一口氣。此次參戰，對外在打倒帝國主義，對內爲適應民意，否則即違反國民意向，違反革命意義，也就是違反本身任務。參戰出於自動，亦出於志願，參戰以後，對後方種種問題應迅速解決，以負起參戰之任務。如何使物資集中，如何增加生產，則繫於後方洽安之確立，此點各位皆爲軍隊負責者，要努力向前邁進，亦即對總力戰之最大貢獻。關於治安問題有二點：（一）本身軍隊的組識訓練健全與否，各應對於職務上常常自覺，自己部隊的學術如何，要每天每一時刻留心。（二）在自己防地內共黨及土匪，應如何加以肅清，使地方治安確保，人民能安居才能生產，國府對此點已有很好的計劃，亦已確定方針，希望各位遵照中央的計劃，奉行貫澈到底，才能達到國民黨排除帝國主義及解放中國之目的。</p>
<p>此外，各位團長來此受訓一月，應確實認淸本身責任，對部隊才有希望，對參戰才能完成。至於幹部總隊同志，自己知道本身是下層重要的幹部，等於人體中細胞組織之最重要者。敎導隊的同學中，有大學學生高中學生，都是知識靑年，大家都知道國家的危機和本身的責任前來入伍，希望各位應本此次入伍之初志，以建設理想的軍隊，爲每個人的責任。有了好軍隊，國家前途纔能光明，有了前途個人自會有前途的。今天本人對各位，實深寄予最大的希望。」</p>

<p>星期評論</p>
<h3>斷然強化政治</h3>
<p>— 霖笙</p>
<p>盟邦日本爲確立遂行決戰期間的强力政治，奏薦翼贊政治會總裁小林大將入閣，任國務相，而日本政體益見强化，勇斷實行軍官民一體的强力政治，以適應重大戰局。這次戰爭，是大東亞全民族的戰爭，中國也担當着重要的一員，中華民族的獨立解放，也決定於這次戰爭，那末，中國政治，亦應隨戰局的需要，與盟邦日本採同一步調，强化政治。</p>
<p>回顧我國政治機橋之不健全，行政設施之久完善，實是推行國政的重要阻礙。我國政治在平時本來就不夠健全，及至戰時，尤其是決戰階段的現在，一切政治上的不健全現象，完全暴露無遣。</p>
<p>至於當前我國在政治方面所暴露的種種缺點，各方已經指出過很多，本報也曾一再貢獻具體意見，以作當政者的參考；可是實際上似乎還未能積極整飭與澈底革新。</p>
<p>組織重疊，機關林立，事權分散，職責不專；祗重浮面，不求實際；……這些都是我國政治組織，行政設施及人事機稱的顯著缺點。由於組織重疊，機關林立，於是輕則徒然耗時勞力，浪費物資，空有衙門，而無事辦有成績。重則更有爾牽我制，不成事反會敗事。由於事權分散，職責不專，於是弄成有事大家推，不負責任。由於祗重浮面不求實際，於是做事抱定報帳主義，以虛報實，甚至有些會議，所有議案，盡成具文。</p>
<p>爲求政事之眞能改善，我們現在於重複指出缺點之後，再提出革新政治的四大原則：</p>
<p>第一是强力政治。就是要澈底加强施政的力量。政治機構行政組織須力求簡素而單純，事權須統一，職責須集中，澈頭澈尾革除官僚主義的習氣，敷衍塞責的作風；應該實事求是，發揮政治上的强大力量。</p>
<p>第二是專家政治。就是用人要以人才爲本位。有能力有才幹的人，必須百計設法羅致之，給他們以機會，給他們以實力。任何事情應讓專家去做，應讓對於這一事情確具智能的人負責去幹。</p>
<p>第三是親民政治。戰時人民爲國家一切力量的基礎，政府務必設法妥善保養。戰時人民固然有特別刻苦耐勞，爲國犧牲的義務，但政府也有替人民保障最低限度安全，最起碼生活的責任。否則戰爭也就不易進行。又爲徵詢人民意見，以求下情上達，更有設立民意機關的必要，公選眞正能够代表民衆的人士，主持其事。庶政府和人民間的隔閡，可以減免。</p>
<p>第四是廉潔政治。我國許多事情弄不好，貪污常氏主要根源之一。提倡廉潔政治雖然喊之已久，但年來未見有何成績。要使事情做得好，廉潔政治必須建立的，政府現在一面應盡可能改善公務員的待遇，一面則用重典處置營私舞弊，以嚴行懲辦貪贓枉法。庶幾上廉下潔，政治可得上軌道。</p>
<p>鑒於時局的嚴重，我國政治太趕不上現實，特作呼籲如上，願當局有以斷然處置。</p>
<h3>日議會定下週　舉行開院式　陸海兩相將報告戰況</h3>
<p>東京二十三日中央社電　日本第八十六次議會大戰下舉行之第四次通常議會，二十四日開始召集，本議會意義極爲重大，堪稱決戰議會，政府及貴衆兩院議員，莫不期待由本議會確立決戰之各能勢，而着手作萬全之準備，刻政府方面已決定明年度一般會計槪算（二百二十二億），並提出二十一件法案，餘者僅爲留待明春一月四日決定之特別會計及留待該月十二日決定之法律案，成文事宜待藉此次議會使國民澈底瞭解現戰局之眞相，同時並對國民明示政府完遂戰爭之決意。對於貴衆兩院中樞之翼政會曾於二十二日舉行代議土議會，決定對議會之方針，秉小林總裁致詞中所謂當質則質，當補里補之態度支持政府，藉使全國總力促成戰力決勝第四年成爲勝利之年。又從來幷審議運營事宜，於措置方面，亦加以刷新，尤其此次翼政會總裁之就任國務相，更完成官民一體之體勢，而發揮此次決戰議會之眞意。開始召集之二十四日貴衆兩院議員，皆於午前九時齊集貴族院，進行成立手續，再將此通吿政府及衆議院，二十五日爲大正天皇祭休假，二十六日舉行開院式，幷開勅語奉答文案會議及選舉全院委員長常任委員，二十七日兩院共同舉行會議，由杉山陸相，米內海相報吿戰况，如無特別問題發生時，則一俟新年休假完了後，即可及早於明春再繼續舉行，以期迅速發揮新議會之使命。</p>

<h3>請大家發揮「博愛」精神</h3>
<p>今天是「聖誕前夕」，一般公子哥兒，都認作「在歡之夜」，通宵達旦，到處游樂，在國家承平之時，一年一度，盡一夜之歡，果然未可厚非，但處今萬方多難之秋，如果大家忘了一切的責任，未免太嫌過分，我們今天對於各界有三點希望：（一）海上萬千基督敎徒，發揮上帝「博愛」精神，多做些社會公益事業；（二）一般公子哥兒，今夜節省一些無謂的消耗，明天送來捐作助學金；（三）今明明夜所有游樂塲所，如戲院·酒家·茶室·舞塲……等，提出一筆收入，認捐一隊。本報受助的五千子弟，那一個不是刻苦勵學的靑年？那一個不是大可造就的人材？將來國家社會，深資倚畀。所惜他們有的受了砲火的洗禮，家產蕩然；有的受了生活的壓迫，衣食不周，他們的家雖窮，而志不屈，前程的遠大，不比富貴人家子弟差。目前最緊要的，是希冀有錢的人士，多多帮助，多多救濟，這就要看大家「博愛」的精神，能發揮到如何程度。</p>

<h3>神風特攻隊的光輝戰記</h3>
<p>呵，　鳳今天又在菲鳥海面上吹了。目從十月二十四日以來，由於日本艦隊的張襲，和陸海空部隊的猛擊，　伊泰鳥的敵美龐大機動部隊，曾遭受毀滅性的打擊。但敵美爲挽狂瀾於旣倒，又於二十九日，以新的機動部隊出現於拉孟灣東方海面，三十日出現於斯魯安鳥東方海面。都用艦載機襲擊日本所有空軍基地。然而日本以陸軍飛機猛烈迎擊，竟完全粉碎了敵美的妄想。敵美的航空母艦，受到日本神風特攻隊視死如歸的體撞打擊，甚至忘記收容自己的艦載機，而一跑了之。下面就是二十九和三十日神風特攻隊的光輝戰記。</p>
<p>發現敵艦</p>
<p>偵察機於上午〇時〇分，飛電傳來「發現敵美機動部隊」的消息，接着又拍電報告敵美機動部隊位置，進路，速度等。日本各個基地，都充滿着「來一艦毀一艦」的精神，眨眼間完全佈置好了堅强的邀擊等候的期間，敵機胆雲中透露出來。戰鬥機和轟炸機的聯合編隊，共有七十多架此類艦載機。此時我方早已在空中準備激擊的戰鬥機羣，一直對着敵美這一編隊衝向前去。總　閃電似的劉來，致使敵纏紊亂了陣角，各留飛散。敵美矗炸機，乘機連續當投炸彈。結果，只是大地上憑空又增添了不小坑穴。最初看見很微小，逐漸粗大起來，突然一聲爆裂的，這原來是日本戰鬥機急降追擊敵方逃走中的格拉曼式戰鬥機。砰砰砰！連續的幾聲機槍掃射，準確的粒粒子彈擊中敵機，於是敵機應聲火起，而墜下。</p>
<p>痛擊敵機</p>
<p>一架又一架地彼擊墜下去，其實，這也是勢所必至的事。因爲道一天〇〇時，擊敵方機動部隊，擊沉大型航空母艦一艘，起火燃燒的有巡洋艦一艘，其他軍艦兩艘。</p>
<p>敵人由於我們空軍的母艦竟忘記收容自己的機，獨自逃去。</p>
<p>三十日，我們神風特別攻擊隊的一隊，在菲律賓中部斯魯安島東方海面上，向敵美機動部隊實行壯烈無比的體撞戰術。結果，根據掩護機向基地所作的報告，說：</p>
<p>偉大戰果</p>
<p>神風特別攻擊隊在掩護機保護之下，於〇時〇分，從〇〇基地出發，向三艘航空母艦（）大型一，中型一，小型或巡洋艦一）以及一艘戰鬥艦爲中心的敵美機動部隊攻擊。三架飛機擴及大型航空母艦，致生爆裂，結果沉沒。一架飛機撞及中型航空母艦，致使停擺。一架飛機撞及小型航空母艦，雖炸裂屬實，但不久被大型航空母艦的烟霧所遮，結果如何不得而知。一架飛機撞及戰鬥艦的末尾〇—朗讀戰果的學生出身的年青士官，未及讀完，聲淚俱下。</p>
<p>全體連人帶糧，與敵拼命，這種崇高而悲壯的敢死體撞。當記者聽到「三機命中大型空母」的無綫電報捷時，心頭鼻際在發酸，而回想出發前長官命令「一號機，二號機。」三號機衝向大型空母！」時，特攻隊員那種視死如歸的英勇精神，眞是令人敬服。他們高唱着「爲國家的光榮，死何足惜」歌詞，滿面充滿着愛國忠君的真誠，這是記者永生不能忘記的。（安譯自十一月十日朝日新聞菲島通信）</p>
<p>雷伊泰島戰區形勢圖</p>
<h3>雷伊泰島戰避概況</h3>
<p>敵美軍自十月二十日在雷伊泰島登陸以來，日美太平洋決戰就於此展開。</p>
<p>雷伊泰島南北約四十里，北部最闊處東西十八里，巴伊巴伊附近，則不過六里。因此，戰塲並無大陸上可容大部隊實行機動戰的廣闊，但也不像培里琉島那樣可用艦砲射擊的彈幕來掩護部隊的活動。</p>
<p>現在，該鳥戰綫分爲三處，即：（一）卡里加拉灣方面，（二）達加米方面，（三）西海岸巴伊巴伊方面。進入十二月以後，以中央高地爲界，東側雷伊泰平原已入雨季，因而戰塲上敵軍自誇的優秀裝備顯然受到限制，機械化部隊的重戰車。牽引車等，均失却機動性，敵軍的苦惱正日益增加，而日軍則增派新銳部隊，待機殲敵。蓋白十一月一日日新銳增援部隊在××登陸以後，敵軍的戰略已不得不根本改變了。</p>
<p>敵軍爲欲壓制日軍後方補給基地，於卡里加拉方面配置第二十四師精兵一師，企圖從卡里加拉經卡包康。瑪拿軋斯那斯。里蒙而南下奧爾莫克方面，南方則由阿勃育格進出西海岸巴伊巴伊，更向北進，以期南北呼應，挾擊奧爾莫克。因此，遂與沿奧爾莫克大路北進的日軍新銳部隊在里蒙附近發生最初的遭遇戰，迄至十五日止，日軍精銳已將敵美大部隊驅向瑪拿軋那那斯的海岸綫附近，前進到可以俯瞰敵軍的山岳斜面。及至十七日，更於卡包康·克拉香岬之間，切斷敵軍退路，將敵美第二十四師完全包圍起來。於是敵万極感焦慮，甚至由卡里加拉派舟艇運送糧食，彈藥接濟被圍的軍隊，嬝後卒由海路從卡里加拉派遣第三十二師前往救援。可是頹勢已經無法挽回，前往救援第二十四師的第三十二師，正如飛蛾撲火，在海岸綫至五百餘米的俠隘地域遭到日軍的迎頭痛擊。（譯自十二月八日每日新聞）</p>

<h3>古城</h3>
<p>— 川我</p>
<p>我記憶中的古城頭是永遠新鮮的。</p>
<p>淸明的秋天，陽光中發散着香氣，——異鄕的氣息未見得及不到故鄕的氣息的甜蜜吧，有時，我好像覺得流浪也是一種愉快。</p>
<p>一個不善尋快樂的孩子也變得高興起來了，他伴着我時常爬上那殘破而堅固的城牆，默坐在城堞上。浩闊的沅一江縈迴在城下，閃着靑白色迷茫的光。黃褐斑剝的帆船櫛比地泊在江邊，桅桿高聳，參差疏密地織成閒靜的緯網。而往來逡巡着的船隻却一直是怱迫的，發出有節奏的排水聲，合着興奮者的心跳。看吧，天是乾藍的，幾片白雲悠悠，似乎在飛，又似乎在徘徊，於是，江水爲它而沉默了。水與天是無言吻抱着的。當較大的輪船揚着黑烟昂然從水天之間駛來的時候，我們會感到穆肅與偉大的可喜。</p>
<p>但我們不甘再沉默了。我冒險地立在高出一的城堞上，腿禁不住酸顫起來。我用顫抖且喜悅的聲曾對我的同伴靑說：「假使我從這上面跳進江裏去，這一瞬間是何等的新奇與偉大呵！」</p>
<p>他笑了。他放下預備寫生的鉛筆，沉思着說：「」生命並不能爲了一瞬間的新奇與偉大而犧牲的。」</p>
<p>我拉着他的手在城頭上散步起來。這城頭好比鄉間的大道：中間是寬闊的土路，兩旁長滿　　的小草；但這兒沒有灰塵，沒有行人，儘可任你悠閒地俯覽城景，仰盾雲天，比村道幽美多了。再有那城堞上亂爬着的靑苔野籐，牢攀緊抱，迤延不絕，一如慣說這古城的興衰故事的老守兵，在默默地吿訴我們它們將永遠保護着這古老的城頭，即使在風霜中，在黑夜裘！</p>
<p>不知爲什麼我們又在城頭上競走起來了。我在前，靑在後，竟一口氣從南門跑到東門。啊，這是多麼熱鬧的所在呵！南門是冷靜的，富有詩意的，而東門却是活躍的，充滿着生氣的。城下是個大碉頭，碼頭工人上下忙碌着，裝卸笨重的貨物；挑水夫把河水「担担的挑進城，走着沉重而又輕快的脚步；乘客從船上一批又一批的湧上來，在沾滿風塵的面孔上透露出希望的微笑；也有些隊伍，歌聲呼應着整齊的步伐。……當教從沉醉中呼躍起來的時候，靑巳坐在那裏開始用心於他那幅力的寫眞圖。</p>
<p>我們的同伴中還有鵑——一個膽怯的女孩，平時她是不肯同我們到城頭上去逛的，但我始終要誘她上去一次。這時間終於到了，那是一個沒有月的多星的夜晚。</p>
<p>「鵑，今晚請你到城頭上去玩吧？」我笑拉着她的手，「你眞不知道秋夜城頭的美麗呢！」由於她的愛慕夜景和靑的慫恿，她答應我們了。</p>
<p>我們一行人跳躍着踏上這在夜裏更顯得蒼老有勁的城頭，秋風像大雁展着翅翼似的颯颯掠過，高空是自由地舒展着且在靜靜地波動了。面向大江，深藍色的水幻成一片溫柔的綢波，黑暗呑沒了浩蕩的波濤，留下了船的靜影，而水上燈光是那末疏淡地閃耀在靜的夜氣中，給夜眠的水客帶來了夢的甜蜜，雖然，夢裏也有着零落的哀愁。可是，夜班輪船在拉起長揚的氣笛聲來了，它逐走了趕途旅客的倦　，却並不曾破碎了城頭的恬靜。城頭的恬靜是這樣脈脈宜人的，當意識到心頭的舒暢時，便將展眼探向暮黑的遠天。是的，你會看見那沉在天邊的星光，星光浸溶入永，於是，遠江是愈顯得迷茫遼闊了。</p>
<p>一縷藍烟冉冉升起，我們中的老者已燃起草姻舒服地坐了下來。又該是他描述一個動人的故事的時候了吧？我們凝神等待着。可是，也許是道星夜太美麗了，它使這老者懂得了無聲的微妙，他好久未說一句話。</p>
<p>「我們古代的大詩人屈原是不是投在這裏兩死掉的？」鵑再不胆怯了，她張起美麗的眼對着這深沉的大江，似在發起感懷來。</p>
<p>「不，那是湘水；可是，這兒也有着我們田園大詩人理想的桃源呢！」這回是老人底和悅的聲音，是和描述故事同樣的聲音。</p>
<p>「哦，這裏的桃源縣便眞是那桃源行中的桃源嗎？那末我們爲什麼不去玩呢？」小明幾乎要跳起來了。</p>
<p>「從前的桃源已及不到那理想的桃源，現在的桃源當然更屬凡俗，可是，那裏的人已知道怎樣去實際地生活了。」</p>
<p>當沉默復潛到我們中間的時候，星空忽變得更明期更廣大了。我似乎能看見城下的江灣在怎樣起伏着。「抑鬱了千百年的大江面今是不再抑鬱了。」靑底沉思的聲曾飄在秋夜的莊嚴的古城頭上了。</p>
<p>回頭看，不遠的城內正光耀着一團燦爛的火</p>
<h3>自然，曲和畫</h3>
<p>— 桑紫</p>
<p>我爲金敏芝放在鋼琴上的花瓶裏換一點水，想揷上一束新鮮的花朵。</p>
<p>「你忘記這是冬天了，」她笑着說。</p>
<p>我沒有忘記冬天，正如我沒有忘記寒冷的空氣一樣，只是我的心頭有一層溫暖，好像需要用花束來點綴似的。沒有冬天的花朶，我便用紙花來代替它。紙花很美，而且做得精緻如眞花。於是我就很滿足於自己的作爲了。</p>
<p>「我愛一切自然。」我允記得這是一句名言，爲我所欽服過的。</p>
<p>金敏芝以纖白的手指按上整夠的奶色琴鍵，彈一曲蕭邦。當音符跳動着變化多端的秩序，美怡的聲音蕩漾入空氣，我以一個音樂外行的身份迷醉於樂曲的進行。……</p>
<p>這是自然，我稱讚它然後我惊醒了，由於樂曲的停止。金敏芝的眼睛有疑問的光芒，我熟識她允如我熟識我自己。所謂自然，乃是藝術的和諧；如是，紙花會否褻賫了名曲的神聖，她的意思是我於是不置可吾地笑了。</p>
<p>「我沒有聞見花朶的香味，」她說。</p>
<p>「你忘記這是冬天，」我的話乃是倣效。可是我另外又說：「請盡情，受這陽光吧。」</p>
<p>我們處着的是一間明亮的屋子，有玻璃頂和玻璃門窗，冬天的太陽裝載滿屋。我們就像暖房裏的花種。玻璃上染有霧氣，讓外面冷空氣凝成透明的薄冰，一會又讓太陽融化了。</p>
<p>我稱讚這是自然！金</p>
<p>金敏芝怕冷，袖着雙手，不繼續按琴了。向那裏找求溫暖呢，除了太陽，我告訴她手指在琴鍵上的飛躍是一種運動，寒冷並非可怕的魔鬼。</p>
<p>我沒有覺着她是聽着我的說話的。以漢然的虔敬，她正凝視着琴上面掛在壁間的一張畫。</p>
<p>我在那裏面找着溫暖，」她動情的說，眼睛有閃爍的光。</p>
<p>這是一幅小小的油畫，淡色的部分是太陽從窗檻射進的朦朧的光芒。它掠過美麗的瓶花，掠過美麗的小女孩子天眞而誠墊的半臉，最後射在抱着那孩子的白髮老人的面上，那面上滿是和愛，有孩子的吻痕。</p>
<p>我也確在那裏面找着了溫暖。那幅畫，即是自然本身，那陽光，那靜靜的屋子，那美麗的瓶花，那老人和孩子，那愛情，那平和的空氣……</p>
<p>當屋子裏又響起美怡的琴聲，冬天便去了，紙花有了香味，金敏芝作着手指飛躍的運動。暖房裏是春天，永遠是。</p>
<h3>「雲南起義」觀感</h3>
<p>— 史華</p>
<p>…最近各劇團競演取材於民初雲南起義史實的劇本，如「蔡松坡」，「小鳳仙」，「袁世凱」以及苦幹的「雲南起義」，背景是同時代的，其表現的角度却是多方面的。「蔡松坡」主要是表現雲南起養的全部戰史，「小鳳仙」是一個「革命女性「的面像的離塑，「袁世凱」以袁世凱帝夢幻滅爲經，當時被拘禁的幾個革命者慷慨就義爲緯，交識成一個悲壯的史劇而苦幹演出，石揮編導的「雲南起義」，則囊括了蔡松坡，小鳳仙與袁世凱三個人物，全面的表現了當時袁世凱如何稱帝，蔡松坡逃出北京的整個史實。</p>
<p>…苦幹目從成立以來，接連演出了幾齣好戲，最近　演的「金小玉」是近頃劇壞罕見的珍璧。而石揮編導之「雲南起義」，不論編導演，都超過了從前的水準。</p>
<p>…袁世凱這一人物在歷史上已有定論，可以說民國成立以來的連年軍閥內戰都是他種下的禍根正如「雲南起義」中所云「民爲貴」，我們所處的時代，已非過去帝皇專政的時代了，袁世凱沒有看淸這一點，迷於個人榮祿，假造民意妄，自稱帝，其滅亡的命運乃是必然的。</p>
<p>…不但對於袁世凱的帝夢的幻滅，「雲南起義」中有着非常有力的描繪，就是包圍袁世凱四周的許多羣宵（所謂寗安會六君子）的無恥的面目，也有着深刻的刻畫。</p>
<p>…其實，「雲南起義」應該易名爲「袁世凱」的，因爲整個四幕戲，除了第二幕寫蔡松坡如何出走外，其餘三幕全是寫袁世凱的。第一幕是六君子陰謀復辟，第三幕是袁世凱袍笏登塲，以勾克明行刺不遂爲高潮，第四幕接下云便是袁世凱的憂患交迫而亡。論寫作技巧，石揮在這里充分運用了他的才能與舞台經騐。蔡松坡出走時氣氛的緊張，與情感的纏綿；勾克明謀刺的高潮之刺激，以及最後袁世凱病亡與閔妃的從客就義，都是其諸戲中所少見的富於戲劇性的部分</p>
<p>…「袁世凱」中的袁世凱，劇作者祇寥寥數筆，已勾劃出一個奸雄的輪廓，而「雲南起義」中的袁世凱，石揮着墨較多，所表現的也就比較全面與深刻：食婪，奸狡，剛　自用，野心勃勃，以一已之帝皇富貴，抹殺人民利益，國家民族的前途。他是全劇最吃重的一個人物，白文演來，縱容自如，栩栩如生，相當成功，化裝很像，吃虧的是先天身材的過高。其餘如劉荃的蔡松坡雖因戲少，卻很動人。史原演勾兌克明的忠耿，王駿等把六君子丑角化，寓有的深刻的諷刺意義。上官雲珠的小鳳仙，沈敏的閔妃，以及馬笑儂的老鴇也都在水準以上。</p>
<p>…總之，「雲南起義」在今日演出，有着特殊的深刻的意義，它告訴了我們，袁世凱以一已利益犧牲人民，置民族前途於不顧，其覆亡乃是必然的。</p>

<h3>申報杯籃球聯賽　女組各隊精神極佳　乙組分部冠軍球藝均甚優良　下週有劇戰週五行給獎典禮</h3>
<p>申報盃籃球聯賽，乙組複決，女子比賽，已於本週三展開。因爲女組關係，故球房內另有一種風光，踵踵燕燕，熱鬧一時也。而乙組之複　，各隊俱爲分部冠軍，球藝勝人，精神優良，其演出之成績，與夫緊張之鏡頭，固不亞於甲組賽。我人觀賞之餘，極爲興奮。蓋後起隊伍，有此戰績，實不負我人舉辦之一番初衷矣。茲先鋒本週各場結果如次：</p>
<p>二十日（星期三）</p>
<p>女益康勝華東廿一—五</p>
<p>女綠隊勝雪白四八—一五</p>
<p>乙靑協勝晨藍二二—一八</p>
<p>二十二日（星期五）</p>
<p>女三省勝華東五一—一二</p>
<p>女益康勝雪白二三—一八</p>
<p>乙汕隊勝胖隊三九—二六</p>
<p>綠隊可望穩得錦標</p>
<p>上期本人亦略叙各隊巾幗之實力，茲一經各塲角逐之下，敢加以評語，蓋强弱有別，勝負之判，不難預料而得。</p>
<p>綠隊之球藝，固已爲滬上球迷所洞悉，本次演出有進無退，其守衛之術，地位與釘人並施，益以三將之個人技術超人一等，敵鋒球藝稍差者，實難望越雷池一步。致其前鋒，傳遞之純熟，無出其右。而於擋人誘敵諸點，俱有成效，黃明媛之善作籃下跟進，其演出有謂不讓一般鬚眉兒，不爲過也。故此次可望穩得錦標，殆無異疑。所望者，不驕不意，儘量發揮，賴以提高滬上女籃球水準，有厚望焉。該隊全部人馬錄下：</p>
<p>薛春生（領隊），錢旭滄（指導），謝益欽（管理），李韞芝（隊長），嚴蔚雯，黃明援，容淑儉，王維珍，劉珍寳，汪印蘭，文鵑，竺承然，張敏知，</p>
<p>三省成績進步良多</p>
<p>三省此次整飭軍容，又以隊員在劉荷生積極訓練之下，乃見進步良多，勝華東有如此鉅大比數者，可以鑒矣。新加入之鄧琇林，固亦球壇球人，其潑辣之作風，準確一之投籃，始終爲筆者所佩服。三省得此一支生力軍，自爾得力不少，而陳榴珍之進步，亦確爲事實。全隊靠力勝人尙多，球藝則尙待薰陶，在該賽中有列亞軍之可能。</p>

<p>乙組複賽青協汕隊升級</p>
<p>乙組本週內有二塲，晨藍被靑協壓倒，相差三分，極爲可惜。唯靑協之賽，確有可取，隊員個個氣力充沛，奔馳迅速，隊長劃　西又爲個中之冠，其所以能勝　　者，不無因也。</p>
<p>胖隊健兒亦慘遭汕隊之摒除，其大原因。當係主將董仰峯之離滬。然汕隊有甲組隊員之黨陶，戰術的是不惡，致勝胖隊，能以已之長處而攻，敏捷靈幹，兼而有之，亦似無倖致之成份。</p>

<p>下週內，靑協將與汕隊準決賽，中北則與仁餘鬥法，兩勝者即須於週五（二十九日）七時半決總冠軍。女組亦將於下週內全部結束。綠隊逢三省（星期一）三省戰益康（星期三）均將有鏡頭出現。週五（二）十九日）除乙組總決賽外，有綠隊對益康之劇戰。　　行給獎典禮。甲組並列冠軍華聯與中北兩隊及乙女兩組冠軍，均將全體到場，本報備銀杯分贈四隊，並全體攝影，以留紀念。</p>
<h3>勝負預測，各具卓見　東聯大戰前奏</h3>
<p>明晨（二十五日）十時，逸園有慈藝足球賽一塲，由我華兩巨頭東華聯誼對壘。雙方各擁堅甲利兵，一番鏖戰，自在意中。猶憶上屆兩隊膠園相會，人山人海，造成空前盛况，則此次演出之刺激，不難想像而得。惟孰勝孰負，論者紛紜。范邨及史遷兩君，對東聯之戰，各有見解，茲將兩君之文刋載於下。</p>
<p>聯誼必勝</p>
<p>范邨云「愚意聯誼必勝，何以言之。蓋本屆聯誼處心積慮，整軍經武，一掃過去渙散之弊。而東華仍爲原班老人馬，未加充實，要爲自信太過，顯屬失着。况諸老將復呈衰退現象，演出遠較上屆遜色，相形之下，其勢立判，對葡商一役，東蘿慘遭滑鐵盧後，弱點暴露無造，士氣大受打擊。而聯誼自重振旗鼓，連戰皆捷。近且集中宿營，苦練不輟，用力旣深，成效克奏。</p>
<p>日前果以三對二力挫僑聯，於是聲威大振，而三軍挾續，精神亦愈激昂矣，故就「士氣」方面論，聯誼實已壓倒東華。</p>
<p>再就「陣容」方面言，兩隊門將身手不相上下，惟顯漢近况視邦綸爲佳，內衛則聯誼堅強多多。天生祺祥智勇兼備，無懈可擊，祺祥之搶救工夫，更高人一等，環顧全滬，不作第二人想。東華之李寗莊友仁英雄遲暮，已有心餘力細之感。後防軟弱，禁區多事，實東華之致命傷，無可爲諱。至中衛綫，聯誼三將能守能攻，固若金湯。東華梁樹棠不够氣，林根有勇無謀，僅賴老鐔一人支撐而已。東華前鋒雖稱銳利，惟每苦不能深入敵陣，其病在載麟經易被關煞，地位且過於落後，未能一竄建功。阿戴傳遞固好，第猛衝陷陣，因年齡關係，非其所長。孫老錦近况欠佳，亦無上季威風，祗少壯派幼良與龍海李壵爲驃悍可畏耳。反觀聯誼，本屆以李義臣之發奮，高秀淸周麒麟之肯拚，小將羅壽福之特別卯上，前綫生氣勃勃，其威力決不在東華之下，兩相對照，聯誼陣容自較整齊。</p>
<p>由於上述種種，明日之戰，除非心理反常，或有特殊原委，（如主將缺席或受傷離塲等情）聯誼當無不勝之理，故吾曰「聯誼必勝」。</p>
<p>東華可贏</p>
<p>史遷評云「東華可贏聯誼之道，極爲簡單。東隊全隊將士一心一德，士氣因而旺盛，此所謂得人和者，乃能所向披靡，無敵不攫，固不能以一敗於葡商而估計過低。事實上東華戰聯誼而謀所以制敵之術甚多。蓋聯誼之鋒綫，似已漸趨正常。但東華之守衛術，能以一當一之策，况彼此球路甚熟，則東華守衛力之雖較軟弱，亦不難使尙未登堂入室之聯誼鋒綫一籌莫展也。致東華五鋒之各具長處，翼有翼之特點，沿邊直入，切中頭頂，決非聯誼之兩　可比。且兩內鋒亦稱兇猛，龍海有勁，阿孫有路，益以戴中鋒之善於接濟，則聯誼守衛力雖强，亦萬難阻其鋒芒。更明顯者，李天生決非賈幼良之對手，此實爲東華進攻唯一之路綫，而賴以成功，亦無不可。况球隊之勝負，應寄重於攻勢較强隊者能勝。換言之，攻勢多者，亦多機會。明乎此，則東華當可贏聯誼也無疑。」</p>

<h3>Japanese Special Attack and Air Force Bombing Enemy Ships in Philippine Seas; 22 Vessels Confirmed Sunk or Destroyed in Three Days</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on the 23rd: The Special Attack Units Mandara, Sekicho, Nikko, Wakashu, Seika, and Shigisho, along with other air units, have been continuously bombing enemy ships near San Jose on Mindoro Island and in Leyte Gulf. The results of the battles from the 20th to the 22nd, a period of three days, as currently confirmed, include the sinking of four enemy transport ships, two cruisers or destroyers, and two vessels of unknown type near San Jose. Four transport ships, one cruiser, one cruiser or destroyer, and two vessels of unknown type were set ablaze. One enemy transport ship was destroyed. In Leyte Gulf, one enemy transport ship was sunk, one large aircraft carrier was destroyed, and one vessel of unknown type was set ablaze. In the Sulu Sea, one enemy transport ship was sunk, and one transport ship was set ablaze.</p>
<p>A Japanese Army base on the Philippine frontlines, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Seika Special Attack Unit and a new fighter squadron engaged over forty enemy fighter planes on the morning of the 20th above an enemy transport fleet off San Jose, Mindoro Island, shooting down ten (two unconfirmed) and sinking one medium-sized transport ship.</p>
<p>A Japanese Army base in the Philippines, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) - On the night of the 22nd, a large joint formation of Japanese air force fighter-bombers launched a surprise attack on San Jose Airport on Mindoro Island. In addition to setting over ten ground-based aircraft and two material storage areas on fire, another air squadron attacked near the sand line bridge, inflicting significant damage on the enemy forces. The Japanese aircraft returned safely to base.</p>
<h3>The Philippine Battle Situation Remains Fundamentally Unchanged; British Carrier Aircraft Attack Sumatra</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Philippine battle situation, centered on Leyte Island, has taken on a new form due to the enemy's (U.S.) operations on Mindoro Island. However, the fundamental nature of the battle remains unchanged. The enemy's (U.S.) forced landing on Mindoro is aimed at breaking the stalemate on Leyte. Specifically: (1) to disperse the Japanese military's attacking power, and (2) to establish medium and large-scale air bases. The enemy forces will further strengthen their operations in the Leyte area and make them full-scale by absorbing the Japanese air bases dispatched to Mindoro Island, and aim to launch air raids on Luzon Island, construct bases on Mindoro, and disperse the Japanese air power on Leyte Island. Thus, the Philippine battle situation has entered a delicate phase. The enemy's supply lines to Mindoro Island must pass through complex sea areas, exposing their weaknesses. Moreover, the use of large aircraft is limited to areas south of central Philippines. To overcome these obstacles, both Japan and the U.S. must make enormous sacrifices. Conversely, the Japanese side holds an absolute advantage: (1) the Japanese military has bases covering the entire Philippine archipelago like an iron barrel, and (2) the Japanese military's supply lines are shorter than the U.S.'s from their homeland. Currently, the Japanese military is focused on preventing the enemy from gaining bases and destroying their main force in a decisive battle. Furthermore, there have been no significant changes in the Mariana and South Pacific areas. Only in the Indian Ocean did a small number of British fleet carrier aircraft attack the northern tip of Sumatra on the evening of the 20th, carrying out a minor operation.</p>
<p>Talks by Mr. Shindo and Mr. Aizawa</p>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) - At a time of urgency in the battle situation in the Philippines, Japanese Army Lieutenant Colonel Tsuneemon Shindo led a strong fighter squadron to intercept the U.S. Air Force invading the area, achieving remarkable military feats in offensive operations and transport cover. The lieutenant colonel personally received commendation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Japanese Aizawa fighter squadron was commended for its military achievements in the battles of Manila Bay and Leyte, and the unit also received a unit award. These two matters have been reported to the Emperor. Lieutenant Colonel Shindo and Major Jinshiro Aizawa, commander of the Aizawa fighter squadron, met with the Army Ministry's press corps on the afternoon of the 22nd and discussed the real situation on both sides in the Philippines: "The local air force attacking the Philippines, although technically crude, has very comprehensive fire prevention equipment, and the manufacturing materials are also very excellent. Their combat style is mostly to encircle a small number of Japanese aircraft from all sides, and their ages are mostly around twenty years old. When attacking, if there are Japanese fighters in the sky, they will never approach, and even if they do, their bombing is extremely clumsy. Those with excellent skills are the carrier-based bombers flying from standard aircraft carriers, and some of their leaders are also quite excellent. However, many standard aircraft carriers have been sunk, and recently it seems that they are flying from specially made aircraft carriers. When dozens of enemy ships attacked San Jose, the Japanese special attack units attacked them with an exchange rate of one aircraft sinking one ship. Two-thirds of the enemy ships are currently conducting landings, and in order for the special attack units to complete their mission, they still need to prepare many escort aircraft to eliminate enemy interference, so more aircraft must be sent to fiercely attack San Jose. During the fierce battle of Leyte, because there were so many Japanese aircraft, air superiority was entirely in the hands of the Japanese military, but in the heat of battle, due to sudden changes in the weather, resupply was interrupted, which was quite regrettable. If there had been sufficient aircraft, the enemy's landing of two or three divisions would not have been a problem. The enemy also landed two or three divisions on the Bataan Peninsula and Corregidor."</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Heavily Damaged in Attack on Nagoya Area; Over Forty Shot Down and Destroyed</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on the 23rd: The results of the engagement against enemy aircraft near Nagoya on the 22nd, as subsequently determined (including those already announced) are as follows: twenty shot down (including four unconfirmed), and over twenty enemy aircraft damaged. Four Japanese aircraft did not return after self-detonation.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) - On the 22nd, the Japanese air defense forces launched a fierce attack in a combined air-land effort against enemy B29 aircraft attacking the Nagoya area, shooting down twenty and destroying over twenty, totaling forty percent of the attacking enemy aircraft. Due to the fierce attack by the Japanese forces, the enemy aircraft hastily and blindly dropped their bombs, so the damage to the Japanese side was extremely minor. In total, the enemy aircraft attacked the Nagoya area three times, on the 13th, 18th, and 22nd, for a total of approximately 250 aircraft, of which approximately 30%, or 87 aircraft, were shot down or damaged, truly the result of the Japanese air defense forces' heroic fighting spirit and outstanding combat power.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - Enemy B26 aircraft from the Mariana Islands base, starting at 1:00 PM on the 22nd, divided into several formations and attacked the Japanese mainland from high altitude. The main force was concentrated on Nagoya, while simultaneously dispersing to invade Shizuoka, Aichi Prefecture, and Osaka Prefecture. The Japanese air defense forces immediately intercepted them, inflicting heavy damage. By 2:30 PM, the enemy began to retreat westward. The results of the battle are currently being investigated, and Japanese losses were extremely minor.</p>
<h3>Yunnan Expeditionary Force in Northern Burma Suffers Japanese Counterattack</h3>
<p>Northern Burma Frontlines, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) - The 12th Division of the 5th Army of the Yunnan Expeditionary Force, attempting to gradually advance south along the east and west lines of the Yunnan-Burma Highway from the Longling area, has suffered a skillful counterattack from the Japanese military since the offensive resumed in November, resulting in casualties reaching tens of thousands by the end of November. Since May of this year, the Chongqing forces have suffered successive defeats in Rameng, Yueh, and Longling over a period of six months, and their morale and combat strength have rapidly declined. In particular, the low quality of the soldiers is an undeniable fact. The Expeditionary Force camp has not received resupply from the rear, resulting in increasing desertions and instances of looting of mines, and military discipline has been disrupted.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Completes Preemptive Posture for Decisive Battle on the Mainland</h3>
<p>Maintaining Strategic Superiority in the Philippines</p>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch - The Japanese forces stationed in China, in cooperation with the fleet stationed in China, have completed the north-south operations across the mainland and the mopping-up operations on the southeastern coast of China, achieving remarkable results. The damage suffered by the enemy is increasing day by day. This Japanese mainland offensive, in a broader sense, has destroyed the British, American, and Chongqing's coordination in Southeast Asia, especially exacerbating the internal difficulties of Chongqing. Moreover, it has lost its only base for cultivating combat strength in southeastern China, which Chiang Kai-shek called "using the wealth of the southeast to support the soldiers of the northwest," namely Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian provinces, and is heading towards its end. Furthermore, the U.S. military believes that attacking the Japanese mainland must be based on landing on the Chinese coast, which has also lost its hope of realization. The strategic situation of the enemy's coalition forces in Burma has also been indirectly threatened. From the Chongqing side's perspective, the only way to break the current predicament is to open up foreign aid routes. The China-India route is difficult to develop, and the effect cannot be fully expected. Therefore, their greatest hope is that the U.S. military will land on the Chinese coast from the Pacific Ocean. After the U.S. military landed on the Philippine islands, they believed that U.S. assistance was approaching and expressed surprise. However, the MacArthur forces encountered fierce resistance from the Japanese military on Leyte Island and were unable to advance. During this period, the Japanese military easily opened up the north-south route across the mainland, further forcing the Chongqing forces to retreat deeper inland. At the same time, a portion of the Chongqing forces remaining outside the north-south route is in a state of isolation and helplessness. The "Saodang Bao," the organ newspaper of the Chongqing Military Affairs Commission, expressed in an editorial on the 19th the hope that the U.S. military, after the Philippine operations are completed, will land on the Chinese coast. The editorial pointed out the following points: (1) The Japanese military is currently frequently strengthening its defenses on the Chinese coast. The longer the U.S. military delays landing on the Chinese mainland, the stricter the Japanese military's defenses become, and the more difficult it becomes for the U.S. military to drive out the Japanese military. If it is said that landing on the Chinese coast is a strategic prerequisite for defeating Japan, then we must seize the opportunity immediately. (2) After opening up the north-south route across the mainland, the second step for the Japanese military is to prepare for countermeasures against the U.S. military landing on the Chinese coast. The Japanese military is currently advancing from Nanning, Guangxi Province, towards the coast, and has captured Qinzhou, west of Leizhou Peninsula and close to Beihai. At the same time, the Japanese military in the coastal areas of Guangdong and Fujian provinces is strengthening. If the enemy immediately lands on the coast, the Chongqing army in southeastern China will raise its hands in cooperation. Even if the Japanese military enters Hunan and Guangxi, not a single member of the Chongqing army in the southeast will lag behind. The Chongqing army in that area is a battle-hardened elite, born warriors. In short, it is an urgent task for the U.S. military to land on the Chinese coast. (3) On the other hand, the Southeast Asia Army led by Mountbatten should take advantage of the current situation where the Japanese military is fighting to the death in the Philippine Islands and immediately begin attacking the Malaya area with the least effort to achieve the greatest effect. Reading the Saodang Bao editorial, we can now see how the Chongqing side views the loss of the southeastern provinces as having a direct effect on breaking the stalemate in the Battle of Leyte Island and a secondary effect on approaching the Chinese mainland. However, the U.S. military's implementation of the "island hopping" strategy in the Philippines, where the Japanese military has concentrated its powerful forces, is a risky operation. The enemy U.S. military commentator Baldwin warned that the U.S.'s risky behavior must endure greater sacrifices. In reality, no matter how much material the U.S. military pours in, it still cannot resist the Japanese military's strategic advantage in the Philippines. Even in terms of air power, the Japanese air power in the Philippines can overwhelm the U.S. The Japanese side has always maintained a strategic advantage, and the strategic situation on the mainland is also increasingly favorable to the Japanese side. The fact that the Saodang Bao pointed out that the difficulties of the U.S. military and the Chongqing army are increasing day by day will become even more serious in the future.</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Attack Kunming, Destroying Six Large Aircraft</h3>
<p>Chinese base, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) - A Japanese bomber squadron bombed Kunming Airport on the 21st, while another squadron attacked Laohekou, Ankang, and Zunyi. The results were as follows: six large aircraft were destroyed at Kunming Airport, and the facilities at Ankang Airport exploded once. Due to poor visibility, the other results could not be confirmed. All Japanese aircraft returned safely.</p>
<h3>U.S. Aircraft Attacking Hankou and Chongqing Ambushed on Return</h3>
<p>Twenty-One Aircraft Shot Down</p>
<p>Hankou, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) - When the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing indiscriminately and blindly bombed the Hankou area on the 18th, it was ambushed by the Japanese military's air force and ground forces on its return route, shooting down two B29 aircraft and four P51 aircraft, and destroying twelve B29 aircraft and three P51 aircraft, totaling a great victory of twenty-one aircraft shot down and destroyed. The Japanese side's losses totaled two aircraft self-detonated.</p>
<h3>Japan Protests to the U.S. for Illegally Bombing Hospital Ship</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese hospital ship was illegally sunk by U.S. fighter planes and bombers on November 23rd at 8:15 AM outside Manila harbor. The Japanese government lodged a serious protest with the U.S. government on December 21st. The ship clearly displayed hospital ship markings at the time of the disaster. At the same time, the weather was clear, and the visibility was good, so there was no reason for misidentification. Moreover, the ship was anchored near the harbor outside Manila, which was a combat zone, and there were no other ships or military targets nearby. The U.S. aircraft violated international law and humanitarian principles by sinking the ship.</p>
<h3>Naming Ceremony Scheduled for Aircraft Transferred by Allied Nation</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) - Since the start of the Greater East Asia War, the friendship between China and Japan has become increasingly close. In order to show their enthusiasm for promoting this, the Allied military authorities have transferred two V1 military transport aircraft to the National Government's Military Affairs Commission. One of these aircraft has been designated for the exclusive use of the late Chairman Wang's widow, to express remembrance of the enthusiasm of our highest leader. These two aircraft are provisionally named "Peace" and "Nation Building," and the transfer ceremony and naming ceremony will be held in the coming days. The Allied representative will be Major General Imai, military attache of the embassy, and the Chinese representative will be Chief of General Staff Bao of the Military Affairs Commission.</p>
<h3>Many Important Cases Resolved at Yesterday's National Defense Conference</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) - The National Defense Conference held its 61st meeting today, resolving many important cases, excerpted below: (1) Chairman's proposal from the Secretariat, submitted for approval a letter from the Legislative Affairs Special Committee regarding the review of the draft amendment to the Wartime Housing Lease Dispute Handling Law, along with three points of opinion.

The resolution was passed and transferred to the Ministry of Social Welfare for revision. (2) Chairman's proposal from the Secretariat, submitted for approval a letter from the National Government's Civil Service Department stating that Chen Qun, who concurrently served as the Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Branch of the New Citizens' Movement Promotion Association, has other appointments and should be relieved of his concurrent position, and Ren Yuandao has been specially appointed as the Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Branch of the New Citizens' Movement Promotion Association. The request was submitted for review and retroactive approval. The resolution was passed. (3) Chairman's proposal, according to the memorial submitted by the Supervisory Yuan, there are still vacancies for inspectors and members of the Supervisory Yuan. It is proposed to specially appoint Ye Xianqi as inspector and appoint Zai Zengwu as member. The request was submitted for review and approval. The resolution was passed. (4) Chairman's proposal to specially appoint Shen Erqiao, Xu Jidun, Chen Cibao, Xie Ke, Sun Mingqi, Hong Zhu, and Zhang Jun as members of the National Economic Council. The resolution was passed. (5) Zhou Fohai, Secretary-General of the Central Political Committee and the National Defense Conference, resigned due to heavy responsibilities, and Zhao Zunyue was appointed as the Secretary-General. The resolution was passed.</p>
<h3>Graduation Ceremony of the Officer Corps; Commandant Chen's Address (Continued to Conclusion)</h3>
<p>Fortunately, the Greater East Asia War began, and Japan took the lead in launching the liberation of the East Asian peoples. This is the most righteous war in the history of East Asia and a good opportunity for China's liberation. Thus, under the leadership of the late Chairman Wang, we resolutely joined the war. This was not a request from Japan, nor was it to follow Japan in battle, but an opportunity for us to defend ourselves. China, which has been a semi-colony for a hundred years, can finally breathe. This participation in the war is to overthrow imperialism externally and to adapt to public opinion internally. Otherwise, it would violate the will of the people, violate the meaning of the revolution, and violate its own mission. Participation in the war was voluntary and out of free will. After participating in the war, all kinds of problems in the rear should be quickly resolved in order to assume the task of participating in the war. How to concentrate materials and how to increase production depends on the establishment of peace in the rear. All of you are responsible for the military in this regard and must strive to move forward, which is the greatest contribution to the total war effort. There are two points regarding the issue of security: (1) Whether the organization and training of the army itself is sound or not, everyone should always be aware of their duties. How is the academic level of their own troops? You must pay attention to it every day and every moment. (2) How to eliminate the Communists and bandits in their own defense areas to ensure local security so that people can live and produce in peace. The National Government has a very good plan for this and has also determined the direction. I hope that you will follow the central plan and implement it to the end in order to achieve the Kuomintang's goal of eliminating imperialism and liberating China.</p>
<p>In addition, you commandants have come here for a month of training, and you should clearly recognize your responsibilities in order to have hope for the troops and be able to complete the task of participating in the war. As for the comrades of the cadre corps, you know that you are important grassroots cadres, like the most important cells and tissues in the human body. Among the students of the training corps, there are university students and high school students, all of whom are educated young people. Everyone knows the crisis facing the country and their own responsibilities and has come to enlist. I hope that you will adhere to the initial intention of enlisting this time and make it everyone's responsibility to build an ideal army. With a good army, the country's future will be bright, and with a future, individuals will naturally have a future. Today, I have the greatest hope for all of you."</p>

<h3>Resolutely Strengthen Politics</h3>
<p>— Lin Sheng</p>
<p>Our ally Japan, in order to establish a strong political system to carry out the decisive battle, recommended General Kobayashi, the president of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, to join the cabinet as a State Minister.  Japan's political structure is thus further strengthened, and they are boldly implementing a strong political system integrating the military and the people, to adapt to the major war situation. This war is a war of all the nations of Greater East Asia. China also bears an important role. The independence and liberation of the Chinese nation also depend on this war. Therefore, Chinese politics should also follow the needs of the war situation, adopt the same pace as our ally Japan, and strengthen politics.</p>
<p>Looking back at the unsoundness of our country's political structure and the long-term imperfection of administrative facilities, these are important obstacles to the implementation of national policy. Our country's politics were originally not sound enough in peacetime, and now, in wartime, especially in the current decisive stage, all the unsound phenomena in politics are fully exposed.</p>
<p>As for the various shortcomings exposed in our country's politics today, all parties have pointed out many times, and this newspaper has also repeatedly offered concrete suggestions for the reference of those in power; however, in reality, it seems that it has not yet been possible to actively rectify and thoroughly reform.</p>
<p>Overlapping organizations, numerous institutions, decentralized authority, and unfocused responsibilities; focusing only on appearances and not seeking practicality... these are all prominent shortcomings of our country's political organization, administrative facilities, and personnel mechanisms. Due to overlapping organizations and numerous institutions, the lighter consequence is simply wasting time and effort, wasting materials, and having empty government offices without anything being accomplished. The more serious consequence is mutual constraints and counteractions, failing to accomplish things and even ruining them. Due to the decentralization of authority and unfocused responsibilities, the result is that everyone pushes things away when something happens and no one takes responsibility. Due to focusing only on appearances and not seeking practicality, doing things is based on an accounting mentality, using false reports as truth, and even some meetings and all proposals become mere formalities.</p>
<p>In order to truly improve political affairs, we now, after repeatedly pointing out the shortcomings, further propose four major principles for reforming politics:</p>
<p>The first is strong politics. This means thoroughly strengthening the power of administration. The political structure and administrative organization must strive to be simple and straightforward. Authority must be unified, responsibilities must be concentrated, and the habits of bureaucracy and the style of perfunctory evasion must be thoroughly eliminated. We should seek truth from facts and unleash the powerful forces of politics.</p>
<p>The second is expert politics. This means that the use of personnel should be based on talent. People with ability and talent must be recruited by all possible means, given opportunities, and given power. Any matter should be done by experts, and those who are truly knowledgeable about the matter should be responsible for it.</p>
<p>The third is people-oriented politics. In wartime, the people are the foundation of all national power, and the government must find ways to properly maintain them. In wartime, the people certainly have the obligation to be especially hardworking, enduring, and sacrificing for the country, but the government also has the responsibility to guarantee the minimum safety and the most basic livelihood for the people. Otherwise, the war will not be easy to conduct. Furthermore, in order to solicit public opinion and seek to convey the conditions of the lower levels to the upper levels, it is also necessary to establish organs of public opinion and publicly elect people who can truly represent the public to take charge of them. Thus, the separation between the government and the people can be reduced.</p>
<p>The fourth is clean politics. Corruption is one of the main sources of many problems in our country. Although advocating clean politics has been called for for a long time, no progress has been seen in recent years. To make things work well, clean politics must be established. The government should now, on the one hand, improve the treatment of civil servants as much as possible, and on the other hand, severely punish private gain and fraud, and severely punish embezzlement and perversion of justice. It is hoped that the superiors will be honest and the subordinates will be clean, and politics can get on the right track.</p>
<p>In view of the seriousness of the situation and the fact that our country's politics are too far behind reality, we make the above appeal, hoping that the authorities will take decisive action.</p>
<h3>Japanese Parliament Scheduled to Hold Opening Ceremony Next Week; Army and Navy Ministers to Report on War Situation</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) – The fourth ordinary session of the 86th Japanese Parliament, held during the war, will convene on the 24th. This parliament is of great significance and can be called a decisive battle parliament. Government officials and members of both the House of Peers and the House of Representatives are all looking forward to this parliament establishing the various capabilities for the decisive battle and beginning to make all necessary preparations. The government has already decided on the general account budget for the next year (22.2 billion yen) and submitted 21 bills. The remaining matters are only the special accounting to be decided on January 4th of next year and the legal bills to be decided on the 12th of that month. The government hopes to use this parliament to allow the people to thoroughly understand the truth of the current war situation and at the same time make clear to the people the government's determination to complete the war. Regarding the Imperial Rule Assistance Political Society (翼政會), the central organization of both the House of Peers and the House of Representatives, it held a representative council on the 22nd and decided to support the government with the attitude of "questioning what should be questioned and supplementing what should be supplemented," as mentioned by President Kobayashi in his speech, so that the total national strength can promote the fourth year of the war to become a year of victory. In addition, the deliberations on operational matters will also be refreshed in terms of measures. In particular, the appointment of the president of the Imperial Rule Assistance Political Society as Minister of State further completes the integrated system of officials and civilians and gives full play to the true meaning of this decisive battle parliament. On the 24th, when the convening begins, members of both the House of Peers and the House of Representatives will gather at the House of Peers at 9:00 a.m. to carry out the establishment procedures, and then notify the government and the House of Representatives of this. The 25th is a holiday for the Taisho Emperor Festival. On the 26th, the opening ceremony will be held, and a meeting will be held to discuss the draft of the Imperial Rescript and elect the chairmen and standing committee members of the whole house. On the 27th, both houses will hold a joint meeting, and Army Minister Sugiyama and Navy Minister Yonai will report on the war situation. If no special problems occur, then once the New Year's holiday is over, it can be continued as early as next spring in order to quickly exert the mission of the new parliament.</p>

<h3>Please Everyone Develop the Spirit of "Universal Love"</h3>
<p>Today is "Christmas Eve." Ordinary young masters regard it as a "night of joy." They spend the whole night traveling and playing everywhere. In times of national peace, it is indeed excusable to enjoy one night a year, but in these difficult times, if everyone forgets all their responsibilities, it is inevitable that they will be too excessive. We have three hopes for all sectors of society today: (1) Millions of Christians at sea should develop God's spirit of "universal love" and do more social welfare undertakings; (2) Ordinary young masters should save some unnecessary consumption tonight and donate it as scholarships tomorrow; (3) All entertainment venues tonight and tomorrow night, such as theaters, restaurants, teahouses, dance halls, etc., should take out a sum of income and pledge to donate a team. Which of the 5,000 children assisted by this newspaper is not a diligent and studious youth? Which one is not a promising talent? The future of the country and society will rely heavily on them. It is a pity that some of them have been baptized by artillery fire and their family property has been lost; some of them have been oppressed by life and their food and clothing are not sufficient. Although their families are poor, their ambitions are not diminished, and their future is no worse than that of the children of wealthy families. The most important thing at present is to hope that wealthy people will help and relieve them as much as possible. This depends on how far everyone's spirit of "universal love" can be developed.</p>

She is very willing to support our newspaper's scholarship fundraising. Sure enough, with just her word, she raised 200,000 yuan. This amount can save ten university students from dropping out of school. Her contribution to scholarships is very significant. There are certainly not a few women in the Shanghai community who can be as good as Miss Li at keeping their word. It is hoped that they can all rise up to fundraise. The teachers and students of Mingde Girls' High School and Elementary School are admirable for their enthusiasm. Fang Old Lady, Jiuxing Real Estate Company, Rongfang, and Master of Shuqi each formed a team, and their kindness is greatly appreciated. Zhong Xianglin wished his parents good health and showed his filial piety, which is deeply meaningful. Mr. Zhan Peilin was the first paper merchant to donate. It is thought that the successors in the paper industry must be very impressive.</p>

<h3>The Glorious War Record of the Kamikaze Special Attack Unit</h3>
<p>Oh, the phoenix is blowing over the seas of the Philippines again today. Since October 24, due to the attack of the Japanese fleet and the fierce attacks of the army, navy, and air force, the enemy's vast mobile units in the waters near the Philippines have suffered devastating blows. However, in order to save the situation, the enemy appeared with a new mobile unit in the eastern sea of Lamon Bay on the 29th and in the eastern sea of Siluan Island on the 30th. They all used carrier-based aircraft to attack all Japanese air bases. However, Japan fiercely countered with army aircraft and completely shattered the enemy's wishful thinking. Enemy aircraft carriers have been subjected to suicide attacks by the Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Unit, even forgetting to recover their own carrier-based aircraft and running away. The following is the glorious war record of the Kamikaze Special Attack Unit on the 29th and 30th.</p>
<p>Discovering Enemy Ships</p>
<p>At 0:00 a.m., a reconnaissance plane sent a telegram saying, "Enemy mobile unit discovered." Then it sent a telegram reporting the enemy mobile unit's position, course, speed, etc. All Japanese bases were filled with the spirit of "destroy one ship for every ship that comes." In the blink of an eye, they were fully prepared for a strong ambush. During the waiting period, enemy planes revealed themselves in the clouds. The joint formation of fighter planes and bombers consisted of more than seventy such carrier-based aircraft. At this time, our fighter group, which had long been prepared to intercept in the air, rushed towards this enemy formation. The lightning-like attack caused the enemy to become chaotic and scattered in all directions. Enemy bombers took the opportunity to continuously drop bombs. As a result, only small pits were added to the ground for no reason. Initially, they looked very small and gradually grew larger. Suddenly, there was a burst. This was originally a Japanese fighter plane diving and pursuing the enemy's escaping Grumman fighter. Bang bang bang! Continuous machine gun strafing accurately hit the enemy plane, and the enemy plane burst into flames and crashed.</p>
<p>Badly Hitting the Enemy Planes</p>
<p>One plane after another was shot down. In fact, this was inevitable. Because at 0:00 a.m. that day, they attacked the enemy's mobile unit, sinking one large aircraft carrier and setting fire to one cruiser and two other warships.</p>
<p>Due to our air force, the enemy's aircraft carrier even forgot to recover its own aircraft and fled alone.</p>
<p>On the 30th, a team from our Kamikaze Special Attack Unit carried out an incomparably heroic suicide tactic against the enemy's mobile unit in the eastern sea of Siluan Island in central Philippines. As a result, according to the report made to the base by the escort plane, it said:</p>
<p>Great War Results</p>
<p>Under the protection of the escort plane, the Kamikaze Special Attack Unit departed from the 0:00 base at 0:00 a.m. and attacked the enemy mobile unit centered on three aircraft carriers (one large, one medium, and one small or cruiser) and one battleship. Three planes crashed into the large aircraft carrier, causing an explosion, resulting in its sinking. One plane crashed into the medium aircraft carrier, causing it to stop. One plane crashed into the small aircraft carrier. Although the explosion was real, it was soon covered by the smoke of the large aircraft carrier, and the result was unknown. One plane crashed into the end of the battleship O - The student officer reading the war results, who came from a humble background, could not finish reading before his voice broke with tears.</p>
<p>The whole unit, including the men and supplies, risked their lives to fight the enemy. This kind of noble and tragic death crash. When the reporter heard the wireless telegram reporting the victory that "three planes hit a large aircraft carrier," his heart and nose were sore, and he recalled the commander's order before departure, "Plane No. 1, Plane No. 2, Plane No. 3, rush to the large aircraft carrier!" The death-defying spirit of the special attack unit members is truly admirable. They sang the song "What is there to regret dying for the glory of the country," and their faces were full of patriotic and loyal sincerity. This is something that the reporter will never forget.

<p>Map of the Battle Zone of Leyte Island</p>
<h3>Overview of the Battle of Leyte Island</h3>
<p>Since the enemy American forces landed on Leyte Island on October 20th, the decisive battle between Japan and the United States in the Pacific has unfolded here.</p>
<p>Leyte Island is approximately 40 *li* from north to south, and the widest part in the north is 18 *li* from east to west, while near Baybay it is only 6 *li*. Therefore, the battlefield does not have the vastness of the mainland that can accommodate large-scale mobile warfare, but it is not like Peleliu Island where the activities of troops can be covered by naval gun fire barrages.</p>
<p>Currently, the battle lines on the island are divided into three areas: (1) the Carigara Bay area, (2) the Dagami area, and (3) the Baybay area on the west coast. Since entering December, the Leyte Plain on the east side, bounded by the central highlands, has entered the rainy season, thus the superior equipment boasted by the enemy army on the battlefield is obviously restricted, and the mechanized units' heavy tanks, tractors, etc., have all lost their mobility. The enemy army's suffering is increasing daily, while the Japanese army is dispatching new elite troops to await the opportunity to annihilate the enemy. On November 1st, after the new Japanese reinforcements landed at ××, the enemy army's strategy had to be fundamentally changed.</p>
<p>In order to suppress the Japanese army's rear supply base, the enemy army has deployed one division of elite soldiers from the 24th Division in the Carigara area, attempting to advance southward to Ormoc via Carigara, Capoocan, Maraangas, and Limon. In the south, they advanced from Abuyog and out to Baybay on the west coast, and further advanced north, in order to echo each other from north and south and attack Ormoc in a pincer movement. Therefore, the initial encounter battle occurred near Limon between the new elite Japanese troops advancing north along the Ormoc highway and the enemy forces. By the 15th, the elite Japanese troops had driven the majority of the enemy American forces towards the coastline near Maraangas, advancing to the mountain slopes overlooking the enemy. By the 17th, they had cut off the enemy's retreat between Capoocan and Catmon Hill, completely encircling the enemy American 24th Division. As a result, the enemy was extremely anxious, and even sent boats from Carigara to transport food and ammunition to resupply the besieged troops. Afterwards, they finally dispatched the 32nd Division from Carigara by sea to provide reinforcements. However, the declining trend could not be reversed. The 32nd Division, which went to reinforce the 24th Division, was like a moth flying into a flame, encountering a head-on blow from the Japanese army in the narrow area of the coastline more than 500 meters wide.

<h3>Ancient City</h3>
<p>— Chuan Wo</p>
<p>The ancient city wall in my memory is always fresh.</p>
<p>In the clear autumn, the sunlight exudes fragrance—the scent of a foreign land may not necessarily be less sweet than that of my hometown; sometimes, I feel like wandering is a kind of pleasure.</p>
<p>Even a child who is not good at finding happiness becomes happy when he accompanies me to often climb that dilapidated but solid city wall and silently sit on the parapet. The vast Yuan River meanders below the city, shimmering with a bluish-white, hazy light. Brownish-yellow, mottled sailing boats are moored side by side along the riverbank, masts towering, forming a quiet weft of varying densities. But the boats that come and go are always in a hurry, making rhythmic splashing sounds, matching the heartbeats of the excited. Look, the sky is dry and blue, with a few white clouds leisurely floating, seeming to fly, yet seeming to linger; thus, the river is silent for it. Water and sky embrace in silence. When larger steamers, belching black smoke, proudly sail between the water and the sky, we feel a welcome sense of solemnity and grandeur.</p>
<p>But we are no longer content to remain silent. I venture to stand on a parapet that is higher than the others, and my legs can't help but tremble. With a trembling and joyful voice, I said to my companion, Qing, "If I jumped into the river from here, how novel and grand this moment would be!"</p>
<p>He laughed. He put down his pencil, ready to sketch, and thoughtfully said, "Life should not be sacrificed for a moment of novelty and grandeur."</p>
<p>I took his hand and started walking on the city wall. This city wall is like a country road: in the middle is a wide dirt road, with small grass growing on both sides; but there is no dust, no pedestrians, allowing you to leisurely overlook the city scenery and look up at the clouds in the sky, which is much more beautiful than a village road. Moreover, the green moss and wild vines that randomly crawl on the parapets, clinging tightly, stretching endlessly, are just like the old guards who are used to telling the stories of the city's rise and fall, silently telling us that they will forever protect this ancient city wall, even in wind and frost, in the darkness!</p>
<p>I don't know why, we started racing on the city wall again. I was in front, Qing was behind, running all the way from the South Gate to the East Gate. Ah, what a lively place this is! The South Gate is calm and poetic, while the East Gate is active and full of vitality. Below the city wall is a large wharf, dockworkers busily loading and unloading heavy cargo; water carriers carry river water into the city with heavy but light steps; batches of passengers surge up from the boats, revealing smiles of hope on their wind- and dust-stained faces; there are also some teams, their songs echoing with neat steps. … When I suddenly woke up from my enchantment, Qing was already sitting there, focusing on his vivid sketch.</p>
<p>Among our companions was also Juan—a timid girl, who usually refused to go to the city wall with us, but I always wanted to entice her to go up once. This time finally came, on a starry night without a moon.</p>
<p>"Juan, why don't you come with us to the city wall tonight?" I said, laughing and pulling her hand, "You really don't know how beautiful the city wall is on an autumn night!" Due to her love for the night view and Qing's encouragement, she agreed to join us.</p>
<p>Our group jumped and stepped onto this city wall, which seemed even older and more vigorous at night. The autumn wind rustled like a wild goose spreading its wings, and the high sky freely stretched out and quietly rippled. Facing the great river, the dark blue water transformed into a gentle expanse of silk waves. Darkness swallowed the vast waves, leaving behind the still shadows of boats, and the lights on the water shone so sparsely in the still night air, bringing the sweetness of dreams to the night-sleeping water travelers, although, there was also lingering sorrow in their dreams. However, the night shift steamer raised its long whistle, chasing away the fatigue of the rushed travelers, but it did not shatter the tranquility of the city wall. The tranquility of the city wall was so gentle and pleasant that when we realized the comfort in our hearts, we turned our eyes to explore the darkening distant sky. Yes, you could see the starlight sinking into the horizon, the starlight dissolving into eternity, and thus, the distant river seemed even more hazy and vast.</p>
<p>A wisp of blue smoke slowly rose. The elderly man among us had lit his grass pipe and sat down comfortably. Was it time for him to describe a moving story again? We waited attentively. But perhaps the starry night was too beautiful, it made the old man understand the subtlety of silence, and he did not say a word for a long time.</p>
<p>"Could the great ancient poet Qu Yuan have drowned himself here?" Juan was no longer timid. She opened her beautiful eyes and looked at the deep river, as if expressing her feelings.</p>
<p>"No, that was the Xiang River; but, there is also the ideal Peach Blossom Spring of our pastoral poet here!" This time it was the old man's kind voice, the same voice as when describing a story.</p>
<p>"Oh, is Peach Blossom County here really the Peach Blossom Spring in the story? Then why don't we go play there?" Xiao Ming almost jumped up.</p>
<p>"The former Peach Blossom Spring no longer lives up to the ideal Peach Blossom Spring, and the current Peach Blossom Spring is of course even more mundane, but the people there already know how to live practically."</p>
<p>When silence returned to us, the starry sky suddenly became brighter and wider. I seemed to be able to see how the bay under the city was undulating. "The river surface, which has been depressed for hundreds of years, is no longer depressed today." Qing's thoughtful voice floated on the solemn ancient city wall of the autumn night.</p>
<p>Looking back, not far away in the city, a cluster of brilliant fire was shining.</p>
<h3>Nature, Music and Painting</h3>
<p>— Sang Zi</p>
<p>I changed the water in the vase that Jin Minzhi placed on the piano, wanting to insert a bouquet of fresh flowers.</p>
<p>"You forget that it's winter," she said with a smile.</p>
<p>I didn't forget winter, just as I didn't forget the cold air, but there was a layer of warmth in my heart, as if I needed a bouquet of flowers to decorate it. Without winter flowers, I used paper flowers to replace them. The paper flowers were beautiful and exquisitely made like real flowers. So I was very satisfied with what I had done.</p>
<p>"I love everything natural." I remember this was a famous saying that I admired.</p>
<p>Jin Minzhi pressed her slender white fingers on the complete set of milky white piano keys and played a piece by Chopin. As the notes danced with ever-changing order, and the beautiful sound rippled into the air, I, as an outsider to music, was fascinated by the progress of the music. …</p>
<p>This is nature, I praised it, and then I woke up, due to the music stopping. Jin Minzhi's eyes had a questioning light, I knew her as well as I knew myself. So-called nature is the harmony of art; if so, would the paper flowers desecrate the sacredness of the famous music? Her meaning was that I laughed without disagreeing.</p>
<p>"I didn't smell the fragrance of flowers," she said.</p>
<p>"You forget that it's winter," my words were imitations. But I also said, "Please, enjoy this sunlight."</p>
<p>We were in a bright room with a glass roof and glass doors and windows. The winter sun filled the room. We were like flowers in a greenhouse. The glass was stained with mist, allowing the cold air outside to condense into transparent thin ice, and then letting the sun melt it again.</p>
<p>I praised this as nature! Jin</p>
<p>Jin Minzhi was afraid of the cold, tucked her hands into her sleeves, and didn't continue playing the piano. Where to seek warmth, besides the sun, I told her that the leap of fingers on the piano keys was a kind of exercise, and cold was not a terrible devil.</p>
<p>I didn't feel like she was listening to me. With natural reverence, she was staring at a painting hanging on the wall above the piano.</p>
<p>"I find warmth in there," she said emotionally, her eyes shining.</p>
<p>This was a small oil painting, the light-colored part being the hazy light of the sun shining in from the window sill. It swept over the beautiful flowers in the vase, swept over the innocent and sincere half-face of the beautiful little girl, and finally shone on the face of the white-haired old man holding the child, that face full of love, with the child's kiss marks.</p>
<p>I also found warmth in there. That painting, that is nature itself, that sunlight, that quiet room, those beautiful flowers in the vase, that old man and child, that love, that peaceful air...</p>
<p>When the beautiful piano sound rang out again in the room, winter was gone, the paper flowers had a fragrance, and Jin Minzhi was doing the exercise of leaping fingers. The greenhouse was spring, forever.</p>
<h3>Impressions of the "Yunnan Uprising"</h3>
<p>— Shi Hua</p>
<p>…Recently, various theater troupes have been competing to perform scripts based on the historical facts of the Yunnan Uprising in the early Republic, such as "Cai Songpo", "Little Phoenix Fairy", "Yuan Shikai" and the hard-working "Yunnan Uprising". The background is the same era, but the angles of expression are multifaceted. "Cai Songpo" mainly shows the entire military history of the Yunnan Uprising, "Little Phoenix Fairy" is a three-dimensional portrayal of a "revolutionary woman", and "Yuan Shikai" takes the disillusionment of Yuan Shikai's imperial dream as the warp, and the generous righteousness of several revolutionaries imprisoned at the time as the weft, weaving a tragic historical drama, while the "Yunnan Uprising" directed and written by Shi Hui encompasses the three characters of Cai Songpo, Little Phoenix Fairy and Yuan Shikai, comprehensively showing how Yuan Shikai proclaimed himself emperor and the entire historical facts of Cai Songpo's escape from Beijing.</p>
<p>…Since its establishment, the hard-working troupe has successively performed several good plays. The recently performed "Jin Xiaoyu" is a rare gem in the recent drama world. And Shi Hui's "Yunnan Uprising", whether in writing, directing or acting, has exceeded the previous level.</p>
<p>…Yuan Shikai's character has been judged in history. It can be said that the continuous warlord civil wars since the establishment of the Republic were the roots he planted. As the "Yunnan Uprising" says, "the people are the most important." The era we are in is no longer the era of imperial autocracy. Yuan Shikai did not see this point clearly, was obsessed with personal honor and wealth, fabricated popular will and presumptuously declared himself emperor, and his doomed fate was inevitable.</p>
<p>…Not only is there a very powerful depiction of the disillusionment of Yuan Shikai's imperial dream in "Yunnan Uprising", but also the shameless faces of the many villains surrounding Yuan Shikai (the so-called six gentlemen of the Ning'an Association) are also deeply portrayed.</p>
<p>…In fact, "Yunnan Uprising" should be renamed "Yuan Shikai", because the entire four-act play, except for the second act which writes about how Cai Songpo escaped, the remaining three acts are all about Yuan Shikai. The first act is the six gentlemen conspiring to restore the monarchy, the third act is Yuan Shikai appearing in imperial robes, with Gou Keming's assassination attempt as the climax, and the fourth act is Yuan Shikai's suffering and death. In terms of writing skills, Shi Hui fully used his talent and stage experience here. The tension and emotional entanglement of the atmosphere when Cai Songpo escaped, the stimulation of the climax of Gou Keming's assassination attempt, and the final death of Yuan Shikai and the righteous martyrdom of Concubine Min are all dramatic parts rarely seen in his plays.</p>
<p>…The Yuan Shikai in "Yuan Shikai", the playwright only uses a few strokes to outline the outline of a traitor, while the Yuan Shikai in "Yunnan Uprising", Shi Hui uses more ink, so the performance is more comprehensive and profound: greedy, cunning, arbitrary, ambitious, obliterating the interests of the people and the future of the country and nation for the sake of his own imperial wealth. He is the most important character in the whole play. Bai Wen's performance is unrestrained and vivid, quite successful, and the makeup is very similar. The disadvantage is that his innate height is too high. Others, such as Liu Quan's Cai Songpo, are very moving despite the few scenes. Shi Yuan's performance of Gou Keming's loyalty, and Wang Jun and others' caricature of the six gentlemen, have a profound ironic meaning. Shangguan Yunzhu's Little Phoenix Fairy, Shen Min's Concubine Min, and Ma Xiaonong's old madam are also above the standard.</p>
<p>…In short, "Yunnan Uprising" has a special and profound meaning in today's performance. It tells us that Yuan Shikai sacrificed the people for his own interests and disregarded the future of the nation, and his demise was inevitable.</p>

<h3>*Shen Bao* Cup Basketball League: The Women's Teams Show Excellent Spirit; The Division Champions in Group B Have Excellent Basketball Skills; Exciting Battles Next Week; Awards Ceremony on Friday</h3>
<p>The *Shen Bao* Cup Basketball League, the second round of the Group B, and the women's competition began this Wednesday. Because of the women's group, there is another kind of scenery in the basketball hall, with many beautiful women making it lively for a time. The teams in the second round of the Group B are all division champions, with superior basketball skills and excellent spirit. The results of their performances and the tense scenes are not inferior to the Group A games. We were very excited after watching it. The fact that emerging teams have achieved this result is indeed worthy of our original intention of holding the event. The results of each game this week are as follows:</p>
<p>20th (Wednesday)</p>
<p>Women's Yi Kang defeated Hua Dong 21-5</p>
<p>Women's Green Team defeated Xue Bai 48-15</p>
<p>Group B Qing Xie defeated Chen Lan 22-18</p>
<p>22nd (Friday)</p>
<p>Women's San Sheng defeated Hua Dong 51-12</p>
<p>Women's Yi Kang defeated Xue Bai 23-18</p>
<p>Group B Shan Team defeated Pang Team 39-26</p>
<p>Green Team Expected to Secure the Championship</p>
<p>In the previous issue, I also briefly described the strength of each women's team. Now, after each game, I dare to add a comment. It is not difficult to predict the difference between the strong and the weak, and the outcome of the game.</p>
<p>The basketball skills of the Green Team have been understood by basketball fans in Shanghai. This performance has progressed without regression. Their defensive skills, position and man-to-man marking are used together. In addition, the individual skills of the three generals are superior, and it is difficult for enemy forwards with slightly inferior skills to cross the line. The passing of their forwards is the most skilled. And in terms of blocking and inducing the enemy, they are all effective. Huang Mingyuan's good at following up under the basket is said to be no less than ordinary men, which is not an exaggeration. Therefore, it is expected that they will be able to secure the championship this time, which is almost without doubt. What is hoped is that they will not be arrogant or complacent, and will do their best to improve the level of women's basketball in Shanghai. There are high hopes for them. The entire team lineup is recorded below:</p>
<p>Xue Chunsheng (leader), Qian Xucang (instructor), Xie Yiqin (manager), Li Yunzhi (captain), Yan Weiwen, Huang Mingyuan, Rong Shujian, Wang Weizhen, Liu Zhenbao, Wang Yinlan, Wen Juan, Zhu Chengran, Zhang Minzhi,</p>
<p>San Sheng's Performance Has Improved Significantly</p>
<p>San Sheng has reorganized its army this time, and thanks to the active training of the team members under Liu Hesheng, there has been a lot of progress, as can be seen from the huge score against Hua Dong. The newly joined Deng Xiulin is also a basketball player in the basketball world. Her vigorous style and accurate shooting have always been admired by the author. San Sheng has gained a lot from this new force, and Chen Liuzhen's progress is also a fact. The whole team relies more on strength, and the basketball skills still need to be cultivated. There is a possibility of winning the runner-up in the competition.</p>
<p>Pan San Sheng (leading), Liu Hesheng (instructor), Shen Meiying (manager), Chen Meizhen (captain), Zhang Huang, Xiao Yao, Chen Liuzhen, Zhao Diqing, Lu Cuifang, Li Bo, Deng Xiuchun, Chen Ze Zhuang, Le Jiashi, Hu Meixian, Qin Zifang.</p>
<p>Yi Kang Does Not Disgrace the Emerging Stars</p>
<p>Yi Kang is led by Xu Yikang, coached by Wu Zibin, managed by Zhu Mingxing, and the captain is Wu Meiyi. The team members include old and new players, such as Diao Youlan, Zhan Xiuqiong, Ren Kuanping, Zhu Mingyue, Chen Bingrong, Wu Ailian, Li Huizhen, Huang Baoru, Huang Zhen, and Xie Lijian. The team members are generally emerging players. And their changes and sophistication in combat, and the study of basic movements (such as using a holding style for free throws, commonly known as pouring a toilet, this is the most standard basic movement). The young players of the team can all work earnestly, and the offensive with methods is also a special strength. It is a pity that the application has not yet reached perfection. Among them, Ren Kuanping is the most admirable. Given time, the team will definitely become a strong team. There is no problem with winning a seat in the *Shen Bao* Cup. In the game against San Sheng, if they can work hard as before, they are expected to climb to a higher level.</p>
<p>Xue Bai is Clever, Small, and Lovable</p>
<p>Xue Bai is a student army. The team members are clever, small, and exquisite, which makes them very lovable. Their active performance relies on their shortness to make quick movements in and out, which is exceptionally wonderful. The audience at the scene will definitely give them very good encouragement and cheers. Their leader is Chen Hanquan, the owner of the Aidekai Underwear Company. Mr. Chen is a giant in the business world and is known for his enthusiasm for basketball. He organized the Xue Bai team and hired Zhang Juefei as an instructor. Yuan Qixiang is the manager, which complements each other. Therefore, the spirit of the team members is uplifted and excited. Their forwards, Xiao Qiusheng, Jing Shuwang, and Xun Ling, know each other very well and are very tacit. The guards, Zhang Zhili, Nie Baozhu, and Huang Ruyu, are both wise and brave, but their lack of experience leads to easy fouls, which is a disadvantage. It is hoped that they will strive to improve. The reserves, Guo Aizhen, Hou Aili, Zhu Jiazhen, Bai Yune, Shi Meifeng, and Chen Wenqin, are also all promising talents. The team has a future. Encourage them.</p>
<p>Hua Dong's Team Members Have Good Skills</p>
<p>The Hua Dong team was hastily formed for this newspaper's women's competition. Although there was an organization in the past, it has been shelved for a long time. This time, thanks to the efforts of Chen Zhong, the leadership of Zhang Jiaolian, and the dispatch of Yao Ziqin, they were able to reorganize their team. However, because of its hasty establishment, the performance is inevitably inferior to the above-mentioned teams. However, their fighting spirit during the battle did not slacken due to their ultimate defeat. If they can practice more from now on, I believe that they will be able to restore their heroic appearance soon, because the individual skills of each team member are not bad. Here is the</p>
<p>Zhang Jiaolian (leader), Chen Zhong (instructor), Yao Ziqin (manager), Xu Ruilan (captain), Shu Zhenxiu, Wang Huafen, Lv Jingchun, Mao Huixuan, Shen Chong, Wang Qiman, Li Jingyi, Sun Fengwu, Tang Meiguang, Shen Mu.</p>
<p>In short, the complete organization of the five women's armies this time is unprecedented, and the spirit of the team members is so enthusiastic that they do not let the cold weather, or changes in victory or defeat, affect them, which is really something this newspaper is grateful for.</p>
<p>Group B Semi-Finals: Qing Xie and Shan Team Upgrade</p>
<p>There were two games in Group B this week. Chen Lan was overwhelmed by Qing Xie, losing by three points, which is a pity. However, Qing Xie's game is indeed commendable. The team members are full of energy and run fast. The captain, Hua Xixi, is the best among them, which is why they were able to win.</p>
<p>The strong players of the Pang Team were also eliminated by the Shan Team. The main reason is the departure of the main general, Dong Yangfeng, from Shanghai. However, the Shan Team has Dang Tao, a member of the Group A team, and their tactics are not bad, so they were able to defeat the Pang Team by attacking with their strengths, being agile and capable. It seems that their success was not a fluke.</p>
<p>Exciting Battles Next Week; Awards Ceremony on Friday After the Games</p>
<p>Next week, Qing Xie will play against Shan Team in the semi-finals, and Zhong Bei will compete with Ren Yu. The two winners will have to compete for the overall championship on Friday (29th) at 7:30 p.m. The women's group will also be completely finished next week. The Green Team will play against San Sheng (Monday) and San Sheng will play against Yi Kang (Wednesday), and there will be scenes appearing. On Friday (29th), in addition to the Group B finals, there will be a thrilling battle between the Green Team and Yi Kang. The awards ceremony will be held. The two teams that tied for the championship in Group A, Hua Lian and Zhong Bei, and the champions of Group B and the women's groups will all be present. This newspaper will present silver cups to the four teams and take a group photo as a souvenir.</p>
<h3>Prediction of Victory or Defeat, Each with Unique Insight: Prelude to the Eastern-League Showdown</h3>
<p>Tomorrow morning (the 25th) at 10 o'clock, there will be a Charity Arts soccer match at the Yat Garden, featuring a head-to-head match between the two giants of Chinese soccer, the Tung Wah and the League of Friends. Both sides possess strong armor and sharp weapons, and a fierce battle is naturally expected. I still remember the previous encounter between the two teams at the Rubber Garden, which was packed with people, creating an unprecedented spectacle. The excitement of this performance is not hard to imagine. However, opinions diverge on who will win or lose. Mr. Fan Cun and Mr. Shi Qian both have their own views on the battle between Tung Wah and the League of Friends. We now publish the articles of these two gentlemen below.</p>
<p>The League of Friends Will Surely Win</p>
<p>Fan Cun says, "In my humble opinion, the League of Friends will surely win. Why do I say this? Because the League of Friends has been painstakingly preparing and building up its military strength this time, sweeping away the disorganization of the past. Tung Wah, on the other hand, is still the same old guard, without any reinforcements, which is a clear mistake due to excessive self-confidence. Moreover, the veteran generals are showing signs of decline, and their performance is far inferior to the previous season. In contrast, the difference in strength is immediately apparent. After the catastrophic Waterloo defeat to the Portuguese merchants, their weaknesses were exposed without disguise, and their morale was greatly affected. The League of Friends, on the other hand, has regrouped and won consecutive battles. Recently, they have even concentrated on living in barracks and practicing hard without stopping, putting in deep effort and achieving effective results.</p>
<p>A few days ago, they defeated the Overseas Chinese League with a score of three to two, greatly boosting their reputation and morale. Therefore, in terms of "morale," the League of Friends has already overwhelmed Tung Wah.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in terms of "lineup," the goalkeepers of the two teams are equally skilled, but Xian Han's recent form is better than that of Bang Lun. The inside defense of the League of Friends is much stronger. Tian Shengqi is wise and brave, impeccable. Qixiang's ability to save the ball is even better, second to none in Shanghai. Tung Wah's Li Ning and Zhuang Youren are aging heroes, feeling that their hearts are willing but their strength is lacking. The weak defense and frequent troubles in the penalty area are Tung Wah's fatal wounds, which cannot be denied. As for the midfield line, the three generals of the League of Friends can both defend and attack, forming an impregnable fortress. Tung Wah's Liang Shutang lacks stamina, and Lin Gen has courage but no strategy, relying only on the veteran Xin to support the team. Although Tung Wah's forwards are said to be sharp, they often struggle to penetrate the enemy's lines. Their weakness lies in Zai Lin, who is easily blocked, and whose position is too far behind to score goals. A Dai's passing is good, but his age makes it difficult for him to charge and break through. Sun Laojin's recent form is poor, and he lacks the power of last season. Only the young and strong Youliang and Longhai Li Zhuang are fierce and formidable. On the other hand, the League of Friends this season has seen Li Yichen's efforts, Gao Xiuqing and Zhou Qilin's willingness to fight, and the young general Luo Shoufu's special performance. The front line is full of vitality, and its power is definitely not inferior to Tung Wah. In comparison, the League of Friends' lineup is more organized.</p>
<p>Due to the above reasons, unless there is an abnormal psychological state or special circumstances (such as the absence of a main general or injury and departure from the field), there is no reason why the League of Friends should not win tomorrow's battle. Therefore, I say, "The League of Friends will surely win."</p>
<p>Tung Wah Can Win</p>
<p>Shi Qian comments, "The way for Tung Wah to win against the League of Friends is extremely simple. The entire Tung Wah team is united and determined, and their morale is therefore strong. This is what is meant by 'those who gain the support of the people can be invincible and conquer everything.' Therefore, they should not be underestimated simply because of one defeat to the Portuguese merchants. In fact, Tung Wah has many tactics to defeat the League of Friends. The League of Friends' forward line seems to be gradually becoming normal, but Tung Wah's defense can use a one-on-one strategy. Moreover, they are very familiar with each other's play styles. Therefore, although Tung Wah's defense is weaker, it is not difficult to make the League of Friends' forward line, which has not yet reached a high level, feel helpless. Tung Wah's five forwards each have their own strengths, with their own unique characteristics. They can go straight in along the sides and cut in at the top. This is definitely not comparable to the League of Friends' two. Moreover, the two inside forwards are also fierce, with Longhai being strong and A Sun having a path. With Dai Zhongfeng's ability to assist, even if the League of Friends' defense is strong, it will be difficult to stop their edge. What is even more obvious is that Li Tiansheng is definitely not a match for Jia Youliang. This is actually the only route for Tung Wah's attack, and it is not impossible to rely on it for success. Moreover, the victory or defeat of a team should be based on the team with a stronger attack being able to win. In other words, the team with more attacks also has more opportunities. Understanding this, there is no doubt that Tung Wah can win against the League of Friends."</p>
