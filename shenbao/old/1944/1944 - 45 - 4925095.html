<h3>讀米統會聯席會議宣言</h3>
<p>米糧統制委員會召開的聯席會議，會程三日，已於昨天結束，並發表宜言，公告社會。我們因為重視民生問題，尤其重祝民生問題中最主要的精食問題，所以，對於主辦糧政的米糧統制委員會，負起改善糧政責任，特別寄以殷切的期待。過去我們再四貢獻意見，這次會議，又兩度獻言。其實，不僅是與論界如此期待，就是每一個人民也莫不如此期待。當然，我們也知道米統會全體工作人員也是如此期待。可是，諺云：「旁觀者淸，當局者迷。」又云：「見利忘義」，我們寗以「小人之心度君子之腹」，盡其「旁觀者淸」的理智責任。如果旁觀者的話，不盡事實，或者矯枉過正，那末，事實勝於雄辯，在受者固無損毫末。如果旁觀者的話，不無事實，那未，即應深切反省，坦白承受。非常時期，擔負重責者，必須具備能受盡言，任勞任怨的精神，絕無悻悻之色。不但負重責之米統會如此，其他重要機構莫不盡然。</p>
<p>米統會成立以來，一部分工作人員的奉公守法，努力不懈，自不能抹煞事實。可是，一部分工作人員的違注凟職，敷衍塞責，當然也不能抹煞事實。</p>
<p>米統會的人事，如果健全了，縱因社會環境不良，影響該會工作成績，則事實昭彰在人耳目，必能取得人民的司情與諒解。如果因人事不健全而貽誤會務，也是事實昭彰在人耳目，縱是社會環境不良，也不能諉過塞責。總而言之，我們懇切的希望米統會當局以及各高級幹部，對於全部人事是否健全，加以坦白的反省，同時，非做到健全不可。人事健全的內容怎樣，我們在昨日社評已詳言之。</p>
<p>該會宣言中說：「决盡最大努力，使議案件件見諸實施。」值得稱道。至於「希望各方面改善環境，盡力輔佐。凡是直接問接有利於糧務的事，予以維持，凡是有礙於糧務的事，予以免除。」這是關係各方面應盡的義務。惟有米統會先自整飭人事，健全發展，樹立信譽，使社會公衆認識，那末，社會公衆决為後盾，支援之不暇，邊論責難了。</p>

<h3>告日本僑胞　念政信大佐　必勝信念為勝利之道</h3>
<p>我們要覺悟，戰局的前途，日趨激化·如前聽到敵人已登陸馬紹爾島，佔吉爾伯特島，或前來轟千島的消息，而有朝失一鳥，夕失一島的痛苦感覺，那就錯了。從純戰略的立塲下判斷，決戰塲愈近本國，則給與敵方的損害反比例地增加。戰塲愈近，作戰愈易。碎骨粉身，直刺敵人心臟，如其沒有這覺悟，終究不能在大戰爭中取勝。我相信要戰勝大東亞戰爭，將產生幾百萬的犧牲。如果願忍受百萬的犧牲，而擊潰敵人千萬，那麼·百萬的犧牲死也瞑目了。戰爭的結果，凡國民有失敗的心理者，必失敗無疑的。環境無論怎樣悲劣有最後勝利的決心者，最後終必戰勝敵人。</p>
<p>日俄戰爭是為東洋的自存自衛而戰的戰爭。此次的戰爭是從英美的壓迫下解放全部東亞的東亞解放戰。我們要覺悟，這戰爭的犧牲，將十倍，數十倍於日俄戰爭。必須　　付出百萬的犧牲。莞爾而進，全體國民抱有這決心時，大東亞戰爭才能解決。</p>
<p>在任何戰爭中洋鬼十們都是為了本身而戰。現在竟來蠶食東亞這地方，我們十億有色民族，東裝面起的時候到了，决不能依賴他人之力，必須靠自己。我們祗有以日本爲巾心，團結　近的同志國，以從事此大業。這是天命，這是天與的宿命。</p>
<p>日本是世界的指導者</p>
<p>到現在為止，我身經的各方面戰爭中，最初是江　鎭蔡廷楷的十九路軍，後來又在山西與重慶的中央軍，在諾　亨與俄軍。在馬來與英軍，印軍，在八打半島與菲列濱軍，美軍·在所羅門與澳軍美軍交戰，而最好的第一是中國軍。諸君或許奇怪，如以同樣的裝備，在同一戰塲交戰，則以中國的中央軍為第一等。其次是俄軍，這還略帶一點東洋的為統，再其次是美軍，英軍，澳軍。這强力的中國，如與更强的我國完全携赶手來·這世界最强的五億人握手，我相信就使全世界都來也不成間題。兩民族如永久結合起來，縱全世界亦不足恐。中國漸漸的强起來，我們富然更强。如其見到弟弟强大起來，而恐怕他要奪長兄的財產，這種小氣。决不是為指導者的長男所應該有的。為陛下莞爾而戰的日本，絕對可以做世界的指導者。我們誠心等待我們的兄弟中國强大起來，並援助他强大起來。前次大戰中。克里孟校說。在巴黎的前方戰，在巴黎的市中職，在巴黎的後方戰。此次大戰中，巴黎的失敗，就因為沒有一個克里孟校。</p>
<p>僑　命重大</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭現在眞正的展開了。在　　　，已閘明了所謂對華新方針。這對華新方針是什麼呢？日本經過了六年的戰爭，認識了中國，認識了世界。所以除與中國携手以外，日本不能存立。這是與戰局的大目的相符合的。這大方針寶是天皇陸下的聖意。我們大家都沒有把糧日本國體的眞髓，以至於今日。但拜察聖意後，日本是天壤無窮的。何以呢？因為這合乎天理的宏大無涯的大德，故日本的國家是天壤無窮的。如其大家復返眞正日本人的面目，寶踐這大御心，事變不期而解决。在中國的一百萬軍，官，民，如其每個人獲得中國的同志，能够有一萬萬中國人眞正是自己的同志，事變己經可以解决了。重慶在注視上海的現狀。重慶在靜靜地注視着，日本的新政策究竟是欺騙呢？還是實物。在上海親身買踐這貨眞價實的新方針時，事變立即解决，而大東亞戰爭的解决，在於中國事變的處理。所以上海的十萬諸君，握着這處理事變之　。十一月二十五日，我奉軍司令官的命令往浙東奉化，祭掃蔣介石因為戰爭而七，八年來沒有祭祀的母墳乃與汪主席所派的　中將一同在上海乘飛機帶了最大的花圈前往。奉化在彼我的第一綫中間，我們召集中國民衆，並說蔣介石為貴鄉所產生的英雄，而其母墓荒廢若此，實非適常。日本的道義，雖是交戰的敵人，亦，樣憐惜。故召　雙方『解除全部警　，請信衆五十名作大法事一星期。居住於渝方區域中之蔣的親戚亦來同祭，流　　　。我對當地居民說：</p>
<p>請對蔣介石說，即使五年十年，請安心作戰，在戰爭期中，日軍代為守　蔣母墓。戰爭與道義是二件事，决守至最後的一兵為止，這是日本的道義。</p>
<p>這話即不是　　，也不是　術，　由於日軍司令官不能自止的悄緒。</p>
<p>切實實踐道義精神</p>
<p>在此物價高漲的時候，我聽說各保甲獻機運動極有成績，誠不勝感激。在華北的淸家鎖，滿蒙毛織在那亦化的中間，三十七村的居民完全融合起來，以之為自己的工廠而守護之，這是一例。我常聽說在上海有許多善行善事。我們如以赤誠待人，决不會沒有人跟隨我們。所認為遺憾者，我們有權方有力量的軍人本身，尙缺乏自肅性，此點决加以改進。濒死的兵士以背囊中的儲金為獻金造機，一億民衆如完全貫微這兵士的精神，打成一片，英美何足道哉。罵紹爾縱被佔，菲列賓　被佔，也將博多海而，小笠原近海，東京灣殲滅敵人。在目前的戰局中，不要一喜一憂，祗須對國體的本義有透澈的認識，以不後退的决心與必勝信念實行。且我們因願這日本的本來面目，寶行道義時，大東亞戰爭可在中國求其結束。這樣，我們可以不期而為東亞的盟主。假使我們不做所應該做的事，戚行非義，或侮辱中國人，則沒有人會來跟隨我們。要做指導者，不能强求，而須自至。决不是目的而是結果。我在此次演講中報告第一機將土以何種心情來克服這難局，希望址萬僑胞在這决大東亞戰爭之勝負的中國實踐道義，諸君的正富行為，反映到重慶，反映於世界，將日本的正義傅入敵人的心中。現在輪到我們以那　死兵士之心爲心，請十萬諸君實踐這義，完遂大東亞戰爭。（完）（弘　：　自二月九日大陸新報）</p>

<h3>米統會聯席會議　昨圓滿閉幕　大會通過提案頗多並發表宣言</h3>
<p>中央社訊　米糧統制委具會昨日下午二時繼績在該會大禮堂開會，仍由袁主任委員祖任主席，出席副主任委員，中日委員，該會重要職員暨各地區辦事處主任視察專員等，直至下午六時許，始將大會全部議案表決通過後，並由袁主席訓示全體職員努力本位工作，　負各界期望，並宣讀大會宣言。此次會議暦三日，始告閉幕，提案七十餘件，分作入小組研究，根據報告及提案决議，並成立人事業務等設計委員會，共分七組，設計辦事處合併，及分設問題、人事調整，採辦開展，資金活用，以及遝輸等等問題，王堵私檢查囤積抑平米價等，擬建議政府切實執行，傳將來工作計劃便於逐步實施。</p>
<h3>米統偉聯席會議宣言</h3>
<p>本會自從去年十月一晶開辦以來，到現在已經有四個月多的歷史了，據這四個多月的歷史，忠實地顯明地告訴我們，在目前這種特殊環境之下，辦理米糧統制事宜，委實不是一件容易的事情，「事非經過不知難」，的確不是袖手旁觀者憑淺近的揣測所能想像得到的，便是本會身親其事的人，在開辦之初，縱然想得到事務的繁雜和責任的艱鉅，但是在着手進行之後，困難迭出，荊棘叢生，他那繁雜和艱鉅的程度，竟超出我們預料的十倍以上，可是我們旣然已經承擔下來，萬不能因為繁雜而心存怠忽，因為艱鉅而心存畏葸，只得聚精會神，審愼前進，夜以繼日埋頭苦幹，總望上不有負政府的付託，下足以慰民衆的希望，－這是本會工作的過去情形。</p>
<p>事屬創舉職責繁重</p>
<p>當本會開辦之初，一方面由政府簡派了十幾位委員，再由委員會延聘了內外幾百位職員，同時又在各地區指定了一批米業中人做採辦商，便在這混合的組織之下，展開了米糧統制的局面，可是委員和職員門，未必人人都能熟悉統制的策略·於是雙方便缺少了相對的經騐，等到會務展開，工作進行，我們除出以「奉公守法」遺一句抽象生的各言，作為共同的誓約以外，只得隨時互相研討，彼此交換知識，一面工作一面學習，所以一切設施，至少有一半以上是含有試騐性的，試問目前的社會上，能有幾位是米糧統制的斷輸老手呢？只因事斷創舉，職員繁車，同時又為環境所牽制，要相成績斐然，那末我們很慚愧，沒有這天生的能耐，不過在這短短的四個多月之中，居然也有相當的建樹，縱然不敢言功，但亦可告無罪，尤其是在這四個多月之間，遇到許多困難，受過許多敎訓，使我們增加了許多知識，得到了許多經騐，可以做將來進行的榜樣，這是本會的初步收獲。</p>
<p>切實檢討已往情形</p>
<p>現在已經是農歷歲首的孟春季節了，「一歲之計在於春，」正是人們决定一年大計的時候，本會旣然負有艱鉅的任務，並且已有四個多月的歷史，就應該將已往的情形，用客觀的理智，來切當檢討一下，對於那良好的設施怎樣使　永久接續和發楊光大，業於那不良的情形，怎樣使牠逐漸消滅，和隨時防範，怎樣才可以興利除弊，怎樣才可以克服困難，也應該使全體內外的米統從業員，彼此討論得到一個結果，並且各地區辦事處，自從去年十月間出發到地服務以後，對於上海總會及各該辦事處相互間很少接觸，現在也應該大家相聚一次，當面商權業務，交換意見，至於彼此連絡感情，還是餘事，因此便決定在二月十五日起至十七日止，召開聯席會議三天，這是此示召開聯席會議的原因。</p>
<p>會議中心抑平米價</p>
<p>囚爲米糧對於民衆的關係太密切了，所以全國每一個民衆，對於本會無不積極關心，尤其是在目前米價突飛猛進的時候，可是本會上自主任委員，下至倔員工役，誰不是因吃米而身受高價威脅的人呢，我們的希望抑平米價的懇切急迫的心願，决不在社會一般民衆之下，我們很願意竭盡全方用盡方法，實施抑平米價的手段，恰巧有這聯席會議的機會，於是我們便將「抑平米價」作為此次聯席會議的中心目的，很希望在會議席上。集中中外全體出席人員的意旨，產生一個迅速有效的具體對策，可是經過全體人員迎續討論三天的結果，覺得米價飛漲的原因，是非常複雜，非常曲折的，耍想達到抑平米價的目的，還是要從本會內外各部份强化本位工作為起點，同時還要各方面改善環境來輔佐，改善環境不是本會片面力量所能辦到，而强化內部工作，却是本會應負的責任。再一看此次收到提案，大致都是關於「採』「運」「　」「配」問題，關於這四點倘然都有切實有效的辦法，那末採辦順利，運　暢通，儲藏豐足，配給適當，黑市米便根本無從發生，米價也就不抑而自平了。所以此次會議的提案，雖然理由不一。辦法瓦易。然而殊途同歸，牠們各個巨的的總和，可以說便是「抑平米偎」，這是此次會議要向社會宣告的第一點。</p>
<p>最大努力見諸事實</p>
<p>經過這三天的會議，所有六十餘件提案，不論是通過與不迪過，都總算已經有一個結果，有人說「只怕議而不决，决而不行」，我們現在可以正告社會，所有的提案，幸而還沒有「議而不决」的弱點，至於議決而能否實行，那末我們也可以負責報告社會，我們央定盡最大的努力，使　件件見諸實現。不過前面曾經說過，除出我們强化本身工作以外，還需要各方面改善環境來輔佐」，將來各方面的環境能否改善，本會委會缺少把握琮肯定地答復這個難題，但希望各方面的負責人，共體時艱，對本會執心輔導，凡是直接接有利於糧務的事情，希望多多地予以維持，凡是有碍於糧務的事情，希望能够迅速地予以免除，對本會多盡一分力，便是對民食多帮一分忙，我想凡是我們同胞一份子，一定人人可以接受，這個請求，因為我們都是吃米而又都是身受高價威脅的人，－這是本會此次會議要向社會宣告的第二點。</p>
<p>現在會議已經結束，我們雖不敢說將來一定有怎樣的進步，但是至少總有些新的發展，希望社會人土隨時指敎共策進行，本會謹以熱烈的情緒，隨時虛心期望着。</p>
<h3>英國統治印度　終必歸於失敗　松平情報部長發表感想</h3>
<p>中央社訊　日駐華大使館上海事務所主持之定例報道常會，原定於每星期四舉行，頃悉大使館富局定於下週起，改每星期一下午二時舉行，昨日下午三時，假南京路外　華懋飯店舉行，計到松平情報部長，福間副領事等，席問松平部長，就英在印度之統治發表感想。</p>
<p>英人統治印度一斑</p>
<p>松平部長首謂：印度人口，計有三萬萬五千萬人白種人佔有六十萬人，其中英人計有二十萬人，於此可見一個英人，統治印人達一百七十五萬人之多。部長又謂：參考印度年　，在印半時，印英軍之比例，英軍佔據百分之八十，而印　則佔百分之二十。同時在印海軍，全為英軍所執掌。絕無印人揰入其問，而在陸軍方面，士官大都為英人所任，即如印人之優秀份子，祗僅任印軍中尉以下之職務，此乃在印之法律明文規定，是當遭印入之不滿，其結果當然逃亡，而參加新國民軍。</p>
<p>獨立運動潛行頗速</p>
<p>在二三年前，英對印所採取之政策，在我人觀測，已告失敗，而英首相邱吉爾更輕視印人。前年印獨立領袖甘地被禁後，其夫人與子女，亦遭監禁，英國此種强暴態度，表面上自以為告成功，印之獨立運動，鋭勢　為緩和。但此項毒辣手段，更加深印人之對英懷恨，是以印之獨立工作·在暗中潛行頗速，尤其在下層階級方面，推行普遍，至今印之獨立精神，已比往昔深刻，故英之手段，已告失敗。松平部長縱謂：重光外相對英統治印度情形，頗為熟悉。上次邱吉爾首相遺克立浦斯赴印，常時即有感想，蓋克氏乃同情印度者，結果邱壓迫印之政策，未得實現，故我人預斷英國即將失敗，深信第二次世界戰爭，英國常歸失敗。概能棠握世界大權者，其命運僅祗三四百年，是以最近英國之歷史命運·當失敗無疑。松平部長最後謂印度獨立完成之日，那英國崩潰失敗之晶云云。</p>
<h3>若素製藥會社　長尾社長抵滬　三團體昨晚設宴招待</h3>
<p>日本若素製藥會社社長長尾欽彌氏，最近由東京來滬公幹，上海工商聯誼會，新聞報會同本報，於昨晚假日華俱藥部設宴招待。主賓長尾社長準時蒞席。並到岡部·栗本，柴田·兒玉·吉田，武內，橫田，小山，森本，三宅，林俊夫，日高，聞蘭亭（陳彬　代），林康侯，袁履登，夏奇峯，顧南羣，姚俊之，許冠羣，吳藴齋，黃敬齊，李權時，魯風，鄭鴻彥，陳彬穌等數十人，情况頗為熱烈，席間首由林康侯氏致歡抑詞。旋由長尾社長致詞，原詞如下：</p>
<p>長尾氏詞</p>
<p>本人去年會到上海，當時看到上海物價的昂貴，比在日本時所想像的高得多，已惑中國人生活的困難。但是現在的物價更比當時貴得驚人，鄙人對中國民衆此種痛苦情形，深表同情。中國物價高漲的原因，可說是由英美人侵略東亞的野心所造成，要解决這問題，祇有中日兩國澈底合作，粉碎敵人英美的謀略，而建設大東亞共存共榮安居樂業的理想境界。</p>
<p>現在中國的藥品，感到極度的缺乏，鄙人對此，實表示深切同情。藥品在中國自神農時代起，就和食糧相等重要，成為人類生活上不可缺少的物品。鄙人常以藥品製造家的立塲，對於藥品製造，在技信上以及在任何方面，予以種種協力。</p>
<p>尤其在親在食糧昂貴的時候，其根本原因，還是由於米糧生產的減少和運輸上的困難所致。中國大多數民衆，都是從事農業的，可是一方面因農產物的收益減少，和一方面又要買高價的日用品，一且生病，也不能獲得充份藥品，這是一個很嚴重的問題。鄙人這次到上海來，希望和中國社會有力人士，互相協力，在中國製造一般農村人民所需要的藥品，以資救濟。世界的藥品界，現在已到了維他命的時代，在日本對於「若素」，已不看作藥品，而看作食品，在一般家庭生活主要食物上，地位僅次於米，一日三餐，必不可缺。</p>
<p>鄙人希望在中國也能產生這極瘋富維他命劑，並以最低廉的價格，供應給一般市塲上。這樣，對於中國人的健康，一定有很大的裨益。國家的强感，以國民的健康為基礎，希望這必需的藥品，能使中國各地的人都能很容易地得到；同時能跳出這高物價的圈外，使這價康而有益的理想實現，進而對於抑制一般物價的昂騰，也有些微的帮助，那是更所企幸了。</p>

Among the above-mentioned officers and soldiers who received awards, 125 people, including Rear Admiral Isasuke Yamada, were specially promoted two ranks for their outstanding achievements.

<h3>Ministry of Industry to Convene Conference of Economic Bureau Chiefs to Discuss Suppressing Prices and Increasing Production</h3>

In view of this, the Ministry of Industry, in order to urgently devise countermeasures, seek reasonable solutions, and stabilize people's livelihoods, has specifically decided to convene a conference of economic bureau chiefs from provinces and cities in Shanghai on the 22nd of this month to plan to suppress prices, vigorously seek abundant sources of materials, increase production, and strictly prohibit hoarding by merchants. It will also strictly order the relevant competent authorities and relevant agencies to earnestly implement the Provisional Regulations on Wartime Price Management, and must not allow general merchants to regard them as mere formalities, but must ensure that they strictly abide by them and do not disrupt the entire wartime economic system, thereby affecting social tranquility and the stability of people's livelihoods.</p>

<h3>Turkish Cabinet Meeting</h3>

<h3>British and Indian Troops Retreat from Arakan Region; Fierce Fighting in the Fuyung Creek Valley</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 17th (Central News Agency) – Indian Broadcasting Station broadcast on the 16th: "Fierce fighting continues in the Arakan region. Fierce battles have taken place between the two sides in certain locations south and northeast of Maungdaw. As a result, British and Indian troops have withdrawn from those two locations. The Yu army in the Fuyung Creek Valley is engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army northeast of Taungtha." Furthermore, because this Japanese offensive has caused internal unrest in India, the British authorities have actively taken measures to suppress it. The British and Indian Army Headquarters warned the Indian public in a broadcast on the 16th, saying: Since the Japanese army launched an offensive against the British and Indian troops in the Maungdaw area last year, our troops have temporarily retreated to avoid unnecessary losses. Now, fierce battles have broken out again in that area. Due to the Japanese army's fierce attacks and its advantageous position, it is difficult for the British and Indian troops to exert their combat power. Moreover, the Japanese army will certainly not be satisfied with securing the Maungdaw area, and they will continue to advance towards India. At this moment, we hope that the Indian public will maintain a calm attitude and overcome these difficult times together.</p>

<h3>MacArthur Admits Japanese Strength Formidable, Not Threatened by Bombing or Blockade</h3>

Modern warfare cannot achieve decisive results without the concerted efforts of land, sea, and air forces. The so-called shortcut tactics are fundamentally nonexistent and merely self-deception.</p>
<h3>German Envoy to Finland Denied by Berlin</h3>
<p>Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency) – A German Foreign Ministry spokesman yesterday denied British reports that Germany had sent financial expert Schlottinger to Finland for negotiations. Regarding the Finnish issue, the German Foreign Ministry is extremely concerned about the Soviet Union's focus on establishing a pro-Soviet Finnish government by Finnish Communist leader Otto Wille Kuusinen.</p>

<h3>Reading the Declaration of the Joint Conference of the Rice Control Committee</h3>
<p>The joint conference convened by the Rice Control Committee, lasting three days, concluded yesterday and issued a declaration to the public. We attach great importance to the issue of people's livelihoods, especially the most important issue of refined food. Therefore, we place special and earnest expectations on the Rice Control Committee, which is responsible for managing grain policy, to take on the responsibility of improving grain policy. In the past, we have repeatedly offered suggestions, and at this conference, we offered suggestions twice more. In fact, not only is the public opinion world expecting this, but every citizen is also expecting it. Of course, we also know that all the staff of the Rice Control Committee are also expecting this. However, as the saying goes, "The bystander sees clearly, while the person involved is confused." And, "Seeing profit, forgetting righteousness." We would rather "judge the heart of a gentleman with the mind of a petty person" and fulfill our rational responsibility as "bystanders who see clearly." If the words of the bystander do not reflect the facts or go too far, then facts speak louder than words, and the receiver will not suffer any harm. If the words of the bystander are not without basis in fact, then there should be deep self-reflection and honest acceptance. In times of crisis, those who bear heavy responsibilities must have the spirit of being able to endure all kinds of criticism and bear hardships without complaint, without any trace of resentment. Not only is this true for the Rice Control Committee, which bears heavy responsibilities, but it is also true for all other important institutions.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Rice Control Committee, the dedication to duty and tireless efforts of some of its staff members cannot be denied as facts. However, the violations of duty, dereliction of duty, and perfunctory actions of some of its staff members cannot be denied as facts either.</p>
<p>If the personnel of the Rice Control Committee are sound, even if adverse social environments affect the performance of the committee, the facts will be clear to all, and they will surely gain the sympathy and understanding of the people. If the affairs of the committee are delayed due to unsound personnel, the facts will also be clear to all, and even if the social environment is adverse, the blame cannot be shifted. In short, we earnestly hope that the Rice Control Committee authorities and all senior executives will frankly reflect on whether all personnel are sound, and at the same time, ensure that they become sound. We have elaborated on the content of sound personnel in yesterday's editorial.</p>
<p>The declaration of the committee said: "We are determined to make our best efforts to ensure that every case discussed is implemented in practice." This is commendable. As for "We hope that all parties will improve the environment and do their best to assist us. Anything that is directly or indirectly beneficial to grain affairs should be maintained, and anything that hinders grain affairs should be eliminated," these are the obligations that all parties should fulfill. Only if the Rice Control Committee first rectifies its personnel, develops in a sound manner, and establishes credibility, so that the public recognizes it, then the public will definitely support it as a backing, and there will be no time for accusations.</p>
<h3>Sweden Protests to the Soviet Union</h3>

<p>Geneva, 17th (Central News Agency) – According to the "World News Report," the British Cabinet is expected to be reshuffled again soon. Those who may be changed are Lord Chancellor Simon, Minister of Agriculture Hudson, and Secretary of State for War Griggs.</p>
<h3>Announcement to Japanese Residents: Colonel Nensei Masanobu's Belief in Victory as the Path to Victory</h3>
<p>We must be aware that the war situation is intensifying. If we feel the pain of losing a bird in the morning and an island in the evening upon hearing news of the enemy landing on the Marshall Islands, occupying the Gilbert Islands, or bombing the Kuril Islands, then we are mistaken. Judging from a purely strategic standpoint, the closer the decisive battleground is to our homeland, the greater the damage inflicted on the enemy increases in inverse proportion. The closer the battlefield, the easier the operations. We must be prepared to break our bones and crush our bodies to stab the enemy's heart directly. Without this awareness, we cannot win this great war. I believe that winning the Greater East Asia War will require millions of sacrifices. If we are willing to endure millions of sacrifices to crush tens of millions of the enemy, then the millions who die will rest in peace. In any war, a nation with a psychology of defeat is destined to fail. No matter how dire the circumstances, those who are determined to achieve final victory will ultimately defeat the enemy.</p>
<p>The Russo-Japanese War was a war fought for the self-preservation and self-defense of the Orient. This war is a war of liberation for all of East Asia from the oppression of Britain and the United States. We must be aware that the sacrifices in this war will be ten or even dozens of times greater than those in the Russo-Japanese War. We must be willing to make millions of sacrifices. Only when the entire nation embraces this determination with a smile can the Greater East Asia War be resolved.</p>
<p>In any war, the Western devils fight for their own interests. Now that they are encroaching on East Asia, the time has come for us, a billion people of color, to rise up in unison. We must not rely on the strength of others, but must rely on ourselves. We can only unite with our like-minded neighboring countries with Japan as the center to carry out this great undertaking. This is destiny, this is a fate bestowed by heaven.</p>
<p>Japan is the Leader of the World</p>
<p>So far, in the various wars I have experienced, the first was against the 19th Route Army of Cai Tingkai in Jiangwan, then against the Central Army of Chongqing in Shanxi, against the Russian army in Nohmonhan, against the British and Indian armies in Malaya, and against the Filipino and American armies in the Bataan Peninsula, and against the Australian and American armies in the Solomon Islands. The best of all was the Chinese army. Some of you may find this strange, but if we fought with the same equipment on the same battlefield, the Central Army of China would be the best. Next is the Russian army, which still has a bit of the Oriental spirit. Then come the American, British, and Australian armies. If this strong China were to join hands with our even stronger country, if the world's strongest 500 million people shook hands, I believe even if the whole world came against us, it would not be a problem. If the two nations were permanently united, the entire world would not be frightening. China is gradually becoming stronger, and we are naturally even stronger. If we see our younger brother becoming stronger and fear that he will seize the elder brother's property, this is pettiness. This is definitely not something the eldest son, who is the leader, should have. Japan, fighting with a smile for His Majesty, can absolutely be the leader of the world. We sincerely await our brother China to become stronger and assist him to become stronger. During the last Great War, Clemenceau said, "The front-line battle is in Paris, the battle in the city of Paris, the battle in the rear of Paris." The failure of Paris in this Great War was because there was no Clemenceau.</p>
<p>The Responsibility of Overseas Residents is Significant</p>
<p>The Greater East Asia War is now truly unfolding. In Nanjing, the so-called New Policy towards China has been clarified. What is this New Policy towards China? Japan, after six years of war, has come to understand China and to understand the world. Therefore, Japan cannot survive without working together with China. This is in line with the great objective of the war. This great policy is truly His Majesty the Emperor's sacred will. We have not all grasped the true essence of Japan's national polity until today. But after observing the sacred will, Japan is eternal like heaven and earth. Why? Because this is in accordance with the vast and boundless virtue of heavenly principles, therefore Japan's nation is eternal like heaven and earth. If everyone returns to the true face of the Japanese people and puts this great imperial will into practice, the incident will be resolved naturally. If each of the one million soldiers, officials, and civilians in China can gain a Chinese comrade, and have 100 million Chinese people truly as their comrades, the incident can already be resolved. Chongqing is watching the current situation in Shanghai. Chongqing is quietly watching whether Japan's new policy is deception or a genuine article. When this genuine new policy is put into practice in Shanghai, the incident will be resolved immediately, and the resolution of the Greater East Asia War lies in the handling of the China Incident. Therefore, the 100,000 of you in Shanghai hold the key to handling this incident. On November 25th, I was ordered by the Military Commander to go to Fenghua, Zhejiang, to sweep the tomb of Chiang Kai-shek's mother, which had not been worshipped for seven or eight years due to the war. Together with a Lieutenant General sent by Chairman Wang, we took an airplane from Shanghai with the largest wreath. Fenghua is in the middle of the front line between us and them. We gathered the Chinese people and said that Chiang Kai-shek is a hero produced by your hometown, and it is not appropriate for his mother's tomb to be so desolate. Japan's morality is such that even in the case of warring enemies, we also show compassion. Therefore, we called on both sides to "lift all alerts" and asked fifty believers to perform a grand ceremony for one week. Relatives of Chiang residing in the area controlled by Chongqing also came to worship, shedding tears. I said to the local residents:</p>
<p>"Please tell Chiang Kai-shek that even if it takes five or ten years, please fight with peace of mind. During the war, the Japanese army will guard Chiang's mother's tomb. War and morality are two different things, and we will defend it to the last soldier. This is Japan's morality."</p>
<p>These words are neither flattery nor tactics, but entirely due to the inexpressible emotions of the Japanese military commander.</p>
<p>Earnestly Practice the Spirit of Morality</p>
<p>At this time of high prices, I heard that the campaign to donate aircraft by various Baojia has been very successful, and I am truly grateful. In Qingjia Lock in North China, the residents of the thirty-seven villages of Manchu-Mongolian Woolen Textiles have completely integrated and protect it as their own factory. This is one example. I often hear that there are many good deeds done in Shanghai. If we treat people with sincerity, we will definitely have followers. What is regrettable is that our soldiers, who have power and authority, still lack self-discipline, and this point must be improved. When dying soldiers donate money from their savings in their backpacks to build aircraft, if 100 million people fully embody the spirit of these soldiers and become one, what is there to fear from Britain and the United States? Even if the Marshall Islands are occupied and the Philippines are occupied, we will annihilate the enemy in Hakata Bay, the waters near the Ogasawara Islands, and Tokyo Bay. In the current war situation, do not be elated by one victory or worried by one defeat, but have a thorough understanding of the fundamental meaning of the national polity and act with unwavering determination and a belief in certain victory. Moreover, we hope that when Japan's original face is revealed and morality is practiced, the Greater East Asia War can be brought to an end in China. In this way, we can become the leader of East Asia without seeking it. If we do not do what we should do, act immorally, or insult the Chinese, no one will follow us. To be a leader, you cannot demand it, but must earn it. It is never the goal, but the result. In this speech, I reported on what kind of mindset the First Division Commander has to overcome this difficult situation, hoping that 10,000 overseas residents will practice morality in China, where the victory or defeat of this decisive Greater East Asia War will be determined. Your righteous actions will be reflected in Chongqing, reflected in the world, and will instill Japanese justice into the hearts of the enemy. Now it is our turn to have the hearts of those dying soldiers as our own. Please, 100,000 of you, practice this righteousness and complete the Greater East Asia War. (End) (Hongying: From the February 9th Continental New Daily)</p>

<h3>Joint Meeting of the Rice Control Commission Concludes Successfully Yesterday; Many Proposals Approved and Declaration Issued</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report: The Rice Control Commission continued its meeting in the main auditorium of the association at 2:00 PM yesterday, chaired by Director Yuan Zuren. Present were the vice-directors, Chinese and Japanese commissioners, key staff members of the association, and directors and inspectors of the regional offices. The meeting continued until approximately 6:00 PM, when all agenda items were voted on and passed. Director Yuan then instructed all staff members to work diligently in their respective positions and live up to the expectations of all sectors. He also read the declaration of the meeting. The meeting lasted three days before concluding. More than seventy proposals were divided into small groups for research, based on reports and resolutions of proposals. Design committees for personnel and operations were established, divided into seven groups to address the consolidation or separation of offices, personnel adjustments, procurement expansion, capital utilization, transportation, and other issues. The committees will also propose measures to the government to effectively implement inspections of smuggling and hoarding to suppress rice prices, so that future work plans can be implemented gradually.</p>
<h3>Declaration of the Joint Meeting of the Rice Control Commission</h3>
<p>Our commission has a history of over four months since its establishment on October 1st of last year. These four months of history truthfully and clearly tell us that in the current special environment, handling rice control affairs is indeed not an easy task. "One does not know the difficulty until one has experienced it." Indeed, it is not something that onlookers can imagine based on superficial speculation. Even for those of us who are personally involved, at the beginning of the operation, even if we had anticipated the complexity of the affairs and the arduousness of the responsibilities, after starting to work, difficulties arose one after another, and thorns grew everywhere. The degree of complexity and arduousness exceeded our expectations by more than ten times. However, since we have already undertaken it, we must not be negligent because of the complexity or timid because of the arduousness. We can only concentrate our minds, proceed prudently, and work hard day and night, hoping that we will not fail the government's trust above and that we will be worthy of the people's hopes below. This is the past situation of the commission's work.</p>
<p>Affairs are Pioneering and Responsibilities are Heavy</p>
<p>When the commission was first established, the government appointed a dozen or so commissioners, and the commission hired hundreds of internal and external staff. At the same time, a group of rice merchants in various regions were designated as purchasing agents. Under this mixed organization, the situation of rice control was unfolded. However, the commissioners and staff members may not all be familiar with the strategies of control. As a result, both sides lacked relative experience. When the association's affairs were unfolded and work was underway, apart from using the abstract phrase of "dedication to public service and abiding by the law" as a common oath, we had to discuss and exchange knowledge with each other at any time, working and learning at the same time. Therefore, at least half of all facilities have a experimental nature. May I ask, how many people in the current society are veterans of rice control? Only because the affairs are pioneering, the staff are numerous, and at the same time constrained by the environment, if we want to achieve remarkable results, then we are very ashamed that we do not have this innate ability. However, in these short four months, we have indeed achieved considerable achievements. Even if we dare not claim credit, we can also plead not guilty. Especially during these four months, we encountered many difficulties and received many lessons, which increased our knowledge and gained many experiences, which can be used as a model for future progress. This is the initial harvest of the commission.</p>
<p>Earnestly Review Past Situations</p>
<p>Now it is already the first month of the Lunar New Year, "The plan for the year lies in spring," which is the time for people to determine the grand plan for the year. Since the commission bears arduous tasks and already has a history of more than four months, it should use objective reason to properly review the past situation. How to make those good facilities permanently continue and carry forward, how to gradually eliminate and prevent those bad situations, how to promote benefits and eliminate drawbacks, how to overcome difficulties, should also be discussed by all internal and external rice control practitioners to obtain a result. Furthermore, since the regional offices departed for service on the ground in October last year, there has been little contact between the Shanghai General Association and the respective offices. Now everyone should gather together once, face-to-face to discuss business and exchange opinions. As for connecting emotions with each other, it is still a matter of leisure. Therefore, it was decided to convene a joint meeting for three days from February 15th to 17th. This is the reason for convening this joint meeting.</p>
<p>Meeting Focuses on Suppressing Rice Prices</p>
<p>Because rice is too closely related to the people, every person in the country is actively concerned about this commission. Especially at the current time when rice prices are soaring, who among the commission, from the director to the employees, is not threatened by high prices because of eating rice? Our sincere and urgent desire to suppress rice prices is definitely not below that of the general public. We are very willing to exhaust all efforts and methods to implement measures to suppress rice prices. Fortunately, there is this opportunity for a joint meeting. Therefore, we will take "suppressing rice prices" as the central purpose of this joint meeting, hoping to be on the meeting seat. Concentrate the will of all attendees from China and abroad to generate a rapid and effective concrete countermeasure. However, after three days of continuous discussion by all personnel, we felt that the reasons for soaring rice prices are very complex and very tortuous. If you want to achieve the goal of suppressing rice prices, you still have to start by strengthening the work of each part of the commission, and at the same time, improve the environment in all aspects to assist. Improving the environment is not something that the commission can do with unilateral strength, but strengthening internal work is the responsibility that the commission should bear. Looking at the proposals received this time, most of them are about "procurement", "transportation", "storage", and "distribution" issues. If there are effective ways to solve these four points, then procurement will be smooth, transportation will be smooth, storage will be abundant, and distribution will be appropriate. The black market of rice will have no way to occur, and the rice price will be suppressed without suppression. Therefore, although the reasons for the proposals at this meeting are different. The methods are easy to change. However, different routes lead to the same destination. The sum of their respective giant objectives can be said to be "suppressing the rice price". This is the first point that this meeting wants to announce to the society.</p>
<p>Make the Greatest Efforts and Turn it into Facts</p>
<p>After these three days of meetings, all of the sixty or so proposals, whether passed or not passed, have finally had a result. Someone said, "I'm just afraid of discussing without deciding, and deciding without acting." We can now solemnly tell the society that all the proposals, fortunately, do not have the weakness of "discussing without deciding." As for whether they can be implemented after the decision, then we can also be responsible for reporting to the society that we have made the greatest efforts to make each thing come true. However, I said earlier that in addition to strengthening our own work, we also need to improve the environment in all aspects to assist us. I am not sure whether the environment in all aspects can be improved in the future, and I can certainly not answer this difficult question. However, I hope that the people in charge of all aspects will share the difficulties of the times and wholeheartedly guide this commission. Anything that directly benefits food affairs, I hope will be maintained as much as possible. Anything that hinders food affairs, I hope will be eliminated quickly. Contributing more effort to the commission is helping more with the people's food. I think all of us compatriots can definitely accept this request, because we all eat rice and are all threatened by high prices. This is the second point that this meeting wants to announce to the society.</p>
<p>Now the meeting has ended. Although we dare not say what kind of progress there will be in the future, there will at least be some new developments. I hope that people from all walks of life will provide guidance and work together to promote progress. The commission sincerely and eagerly looks forward to it at any time.</p>
<h3>British Rule in India Will Ultimately Fail: Impressions of Information Minister Matsudaira</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report: The regular press conference held by the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy in China, originally scheduled to be held every Thursday, has been informed that the embassy's Bureau will change it to 2:00 PM every Monday from next week. Yesterday at 3:00 PM, it was held at the Cathay Hotel on Nanjing Road. Information Minister Matsudaira, Vice-Consul Fukuma, and others attended. During the session, Minister Matsudaira expressed his impressions of British rule in India.</p>
<p>Glimpses of British Rule in India</p>
<p>Minister Matsudaira first said: The population of India is 350 million, of which Caucasians account for 600,000, including 200,000 British people. From this, it can be seen that one British person rules as many as 1.75 million Indians. The minister also said: Referring to the Indian Yearbook, in the Indian army, the ratio of British to Indian troops is 80% British and 20% Indian. At the same time, the Indian navy is entirely controlled by the British military. There is absolutely no Indian involvement in it, while in the army, most of the officers are British. Even if they are outstanding members of the Indian army, they can only hold positions below lieutenant in the Indian army. This is expressly stipulated in Indian law. It is bound to be met with dissatisfaction from Indians. As a result, they will inevitably escape and join the New National Army.</p>
<p>Independence Movement Proceeds Quietly</p>
<p>Two or three years ago, the policies adopted by Britain towards India, in our observation, had already failed, and British Prime Minister Churchill even despised the Indians. After Indian independence leader Gandhi was imprisoned the year before, his wife and children were also imprisoned. Britain's violent attitude, on the surface, may seem to be successful, and the momentum of India's independence movement has eased. However, this vicious means has deepened the hatred of the Indians towards Britain. Therefore, the work of India's independence is progressing quite rapidly in secret, especially at the lower levels, and is being promoted universally. To this day, the spirit of India's independence is more profound than in the past. Therefore, Britain's means have failed. Minister Matsudaira said: Foreign Minister Shigemitsu is quite familiar with the situation of British rule in India. When Prime Minister Churchill sent Cripps to India last time, he had the impression that Cripps was sympathetic to India. As a result, Churchill's policy of oppressing India was not realized. Therefore, we predicted that Britain would soon fail, and we firmly believe that in the Second World War, Britain will often fail. Those who can grasp the world's power, their destiny is only three or four hundred years. Therefore, the historical destiny of Britain in recent times will undoubtedly fail. Minister Matsudaira finally said that the day India's independence is completed will be the day Britain collapses and fails.</p>
<h3>President Nagao of Wakasu Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. Arrives in Shanghai; Three Organizations Host a Dinner Reception Last Night</h3>
<p>Mr. Nagao Kinmi, President of Wakasu Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. of Japan, recently came to Shanghai from Tokyo on business. The Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce, the Xinwenbao, and this newspaper jointly hosted a dinner reception at the Huajia Club Pharmacy Department last night. President Nagao arrived on time. Also present were Okabe, Kurimoto, Shibata, Kodama, Yoshida, Takeuchi, Yokota, Koyama, Morimoto, Miyake, Lin Junfu, Hidaka, Wen Lantin (representing Chen Bingkun), Lin Kanghou, Yuan Ludeng, Xia Qifeng, Gu Nanqun, Yao Junzhi, Xu Guanqun, Wu Yunzhai, Huang Jingqi, Li Quanshi, Lu Feng, Zheng Hongyan, Chen Binsu, and dozens of others. The atmosphere was quite enthusiastic. Lin Kanghou delivered a welcome speech, followed by President Nagao's speech, the original words of which are as follows:</p>
<p>President Nagao's Speech</p>
<p>I visited Shanghai last year, and at that time, I saw that the prices in Shanghai were much higher than I had imagined in Japan. I already felt the difficulties of Chinese life. But now the prices are even more surprisingly expensive than at that time. I deeply sympathize with the suffering of the Chinese people. The cause of the high prices in China can be said to be caused by the ambition of the British and Americans to invade East Asia. To solve this problem, the only thing that must be done is that China and Japan should thoroughly cooperate, smash the enemy's British and American strategies, and build an ideal state of Greater East Asia where coexistence and co-prosperity and peaceful and happy lives can be achieved.</p>
<p>Currently, there is a great shortage of medicines in China, and I express my deep sympathy for this. Medicines in China, from the time of Shennong, have been as important as food, becoming indispensable items in human life. I always use the stance of a pharmaceutical manufacturer to provide various forms of cooperation for pharmaceutical manufacturing, in terms of technology and in any other aspect.</p>
<p>Especially now that food prices are expensive, the fundamental cause is still due to the reduction in rice production and transportation difficulties. Most of the Chinese people are engaged in agriculture, but on the one hand, the income from agricultural products is reduced, and on the other hand, they have to buy expensive daily necessities. Once they get sick, they cannot get enough medicine. This is a very serious problem. This time I have come to Shanghai hoping to cooperate with influential people in Chinese society to manufacture medicines needed by the general rural population in China, in order to provide relief. The world's pharmaceutical industry has now reached the era of vitamins. In Japan, "Wakasu" is no longer regarded as a medicine, but as a food. In general household life, its status is second only to rice as a staple food, and it is indispensable for all three meals a day.</p>
<p>I hope that this extremely vitamin-rich agent can also be produced in China and supplied to the general market at the lowest price. In this way, it will definitely be of great benefit to the health of the Chinese people. The strength of a country is based on the health of its people. I hope that this necessary medicine can be easily obtained by people all over China, and at the same time, it can jump out of this high-price circle, so that this healthy and beneficial ideal can be realized, and that it can also help to suppress the rise in general prices. That is what is even more hopeful.</p>
<h3>Income Tax for the 32nd Year to be Collected from March 1st</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report: The Shanghai District Collection Bureau of the Income Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance has stated that all businesses should report their income to the bureau within three months after the annual settlement, so that the tax amount can be assessed. The date for the collection of the first category of profit-seeking enterprise income tax for both types A and B in the 32nd year will begin on March 1st, and the date is approaching. All businesses should immediately comply with the law and report truthfully.</p>
<h3>Public Utilities Bureau Establishes Central District Office</h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, in order to facilitate the implementation of public utilities administration, has established a Central District Office on Taishan Road. In the future, all public utilities and administrative affairs concerning transportation vehicles and everything else in the city will be received and handled uniformly by the office. The implementation of vehicle registration and inspection in the city will be announced separately at a later date.</p>
<h3>Thrift Association Board Meeting Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Municipal Thrift Association will take advantage of Director Zhang (Yipeng)'s visit to Shanghai for official business to hold its third plenary board meeting at the association's headquarters at 4:00 PM on the 19th of this month (Saturday) to discuss the progress of association affairs.</p>
<p>Yesterday's broadcast time was 7:40.</p>
<h3>The Great Sincerity Silk Factory and Colleagues Continue to Donate Funds for Education: Yesterday Donated 50,000 Yuan in Educational Grants</h3>
<p>Our newspaper received a letter yesterday from Song Baolin, Yang Weiqun, and other colleagues of the Great Sincerity Silk Factory and all its employees, stating: "Our factory colleagues donated 10,000 yuan for educational grants for the third time last summer vacation to reward underprivileged junior and senior high school students. At that time, we drafted six regulations and sent them to your office, which you kindly followed. Our factory colleagues have now raised another 50,000 yuan to reward outstanding students. The number of recipients and the amount of the grants have both been increased. We are sending a check for 50,000 yuan and a revised set of regulations for the grant, please accept them." This is the fourth time that the factory employees have donated to support education. Using their hard-earned money to support the education of underprivileged students is truly commendable. Their noble and righteous actions are especially worthy of being a model for the business community. The grant regulations will be announced tomorrow. We would like to express our gratitude on behalf of the poor students.</p>
<p>High School Students of All Levels to Receive Funds Tomorrow</p>
<p>The list of new and returning high school students of grades one, two, and three who have passed the examination for this year's educational grants has been announced successively (the list of new grade three high school students will be disclosed tomorrow). It is now scheduled that the educational grant checks will be issued on the 19th of this month. Each student should bring their registration certificate and the seal that matches the one used when applying, and come to the office in person to receive the check on time.</p>
<p>Grants Received Yesterday</p>
<p>The educational grants received yesterday are listed below: Great Sincerity Silk Factory, 50,000 yuan; Wang Zhiyun (birthday gifts from friends for his 40th birthday), 5,005 yuan; Yan Hai Elementary School (returned student grant money), 2,340 yuan; Gu Bang, little brother (New Year's money), 1,000 yuan; Lin Ronghua (delivered by Zhejiang Grand Theater), 250 yuan; Xu Weisen, 205 yuan; Jiu Si Tang, 200 yuan; Zhao Cuiji, Liu Jun, 100 yuan each; Shan Cuoru, 10 yuan; Yan Ke, 50 yuan; Shui Yi, 30 yuan; Lan Yi (above four households' manuscript fees), 20 yuan; Ren Nai Shi, Guang Ming Shi (delivered by Pu Jiting), 20 yuan combined; Mi Bo, 10 yuan.
