<p>社評</p>
<h3>心理的戰時體制</h3>
<p>日本新聞界元老德富蘇峰氏發表的一緊急關頭」論文，巳經譯載昨日本報。內中最重要的一句話，就是心、理的戰時體制，他說：「只要有精神，有識志，有氣魄，則千萬人吾往矣」。原來精神的力量正如中國古語所說，精誠所至，金石爲開，是高於一切物質的力量，是一切物質力量的指導者。</p>
<p>什麼是心理上的戰時體制？先要堅信，這次大東亞戰爭是革命解放戰，勝利是毫無疑問的；再要明白，這是一個艱苦戰，需要十二分耐勞忍苦，努力奮鬥。換名話說，心理上的戰時體制，第一是勝利的信心，第二是工作的決心。沒有勝利的自信不能引起工作的熱誠，沒有工作的決心，更不能獲得最後的勝利。</p>
<p>上海是一個謠言最多的都巿，各式各樣的謠言最足以搖動大衆的信念，更足以影響大衆工作的努力。可是上海是中國文化經濟的重心，上海一般人的心理變遷，和一般人工作的努力與否，在在與整個大局有關，而在時局日趨嚴重，謠言越發增多的現在，影響更為重大。為了這個問題，我們心裏萬分的焦急，我們顧慮到東亞大局的前途，我們更願意用最大的力量喚起上海巿民在心理上造成戰時體制。</p>
<p>目前最重要的就在有自信心的人，時時要和大衆接觸，要把自己的自信，喚起大衆的互信，從大衆的互信，進而為大衆的互助。孫中山先生的革命還不是先從一個發起人，慢慢地集合了許多同志，然後得到了大衆的擁護和協力而成功的。假如你自信不堅，那末且莫想事業成功，且莫想人家的互信，你應常立刻退出庫綫，不要妨礙人家的進行。假如你有堅强的自信力，你就應當挺身而出，用你本身心理上的戰時體制，去改造大家的心理上的戰時體制。</p>
<p>次之，有努力工作決心的人現在最緊要的就在把工作表現於大家，以身作則，勇往直前。時局的進展或許還要遇到更困苦的境遇，可是工作的進行應當愈因困苦而愈努力。工作的表現決不是口頭上紙面上的事，而是一切眞實的對於國家民族有利的成績。要希望人家決心努力工作，就先得自己做出一個努力工作的榜樣，這樣，在上者領導於先，在下者自然追隨於後。一個人的決心努力可以推動許多人的決心努力，少數人的決心努力就可以推動整個社會的決心努力，事業成功的原理不外乎此。</p>
<p>長期戰的最後五分鐘是最緊張的局面，可是從事解放鬥爭者的正義，終必消滅侵略者的野心，從來解放鬥爭者永久不斷的努力，終必促成侵略者的自然崩潰。德富翁說：「只要有決心，我們是任何人都不怕的，任何事都不足担心的」。</p>
<h3>大宮島上陸空戰　敵軍千餘被殲滅　明石灣東北日軍固守防綫</h3>
<p>中部太平洋某基地中央社電　大宮島日軍守備隊，刻正與敵軍展開空陸血戰，其中以陸軍中尉石井氏所率中隊與敵奮戰之精神最堪欽佩。爰石井中險自敵軍於該島明石灣登陸以來，即以孤軍應戰，阻止敵軍前進，歷時六晝夜之久，敵軍損失實達千人之衆。同時石井部隊亦前仆後繼，故敵續有死傷，最後殆至全滅狀態，但仍攻擊奮戰死守防棧，刻正於明石灣東北方，整備第一綫指揮新部隊活躍中。</p>
<h3>日海軍確保　湘江水路運輸　衡陽戰事達最高潮</h3>
<p>日軍前綫某基地六日中央社電　協助湖南作戰之日海軍部隊，刻已確保自洞庭湖湘江之水路，對陸軍部隊後方運輸之貢獻非淺。於前七月七日，湘江溯航部隊，更直抵湖南作戰焦點之衡陽。確保水路，使陸軍部隊不致有後顧之憂，即於六月六日及十七日，首對營田及靖港湘江沿岸之渝軍要衝，加以制壓。溯航部隊之精銳，自作戰開始以來四十餘日間，開拓水路達三百餘公里，渝軍對此曾於各方而加以阻碍。於七月中湘江沿岸出擊之渝美機達百數十架，又於該月中，日軍處分渝軍敷設之機雷達百餘顆。最近因陸軍航空部隊之活躍，渝美空軍之蠢動已盡彼壓制，現日海軍部隊正嚴加警備，以確保水路云。</p>
<p>廣州六日中央社電　衡陽之攻防戰，刻已達最高潮。渝軍以日軍攻勢日漸熾烈，似亦感覺已臨最後關頭，近更屢對防守衡陽露出悲鳴。據路透社重慶四日電稱，渝軍事發營人曾發表談話，謂衡陽市內狀况依然混亂，因速續月餘之肉搏戰，故渝軍屍橫遍地，更以無暇掩埋搬運，致臭氣薰天。渝援軍刻自衡陽西南西及北方，繼續增援，其先鋒部隊已到達距離衡陽四公里地點。日軍因已打通長沙衡山，更向南進之大軍，料不久將再大舉進攻云。</p>
<h3>日翼政會强化　與政府提携</h3>
<p>東京六日中央社電　日翼政會總裁一職，由海軍大將小林氏繼任後，會務之進展因小林總裁超然之決意，將更形强化。該會預定於舉行會員總會屆時，小林總裁將披瀝意見，想必可予會員以異常之激勵。又小林總裁此次擬光由整理人事機構着手，然後舉翼政會之全力，與政府緊密提携，負起戰時政治結社之重責，向戰勝之途邁進。而當此一大轉機下之翼政會要望於政府者，爲向中外闡明政府施政方針，其理由係因日本人心一新，舉國一致之小磯米內聯立內閣出現，正當借此時機，對外表明帝國不動之決意，對內使一億國民總崛起。此時貴衆兩院亦可以國民之產塲，表明支持政府之決意，同時並可代表國民向政府積極展開公論以盡匡輔之實貴。</p>
<h3>日產業協議會　決定三項施策</h3>
<p>東京六日中央社電　日本重要產業協會，爲適應戰時之急需，在作戰和生產兩方面之緊密結合下，爲簽揮戰時生產最高度之總力，擬定施策三條：　戰時生產設計本部機能之確立。　活用產業界之知識經騐者，並激揚高度生產之意志。　防空對策之强化及實用華。於五日將該項要鋼呈送政府，在生產人員上竭力錄用官民之優秀人材，及統制會或其他產業部門之代表者，連擊陸海軍一致作戰行動，將樹立生產計劃，綜決定生產配給之方策調整合收買發賣手續等重要事項，作為基本之目的，關於此種戰時生產設計本部機能確立之主張甚値注目</p>
<h3>北平新民會　舉行顧問會議</h3>
<p>北京五日中央社電　新民會所轄總會顧間會議，自五日上午十點起，在北平東交民巷新民會顧公館舉行。於岩松最高顧問及各關係軍民代表參加下，進行各種懇談。按該會議主要係適應決戰時局，結成中日滿共同戰綫，增加生產，發揚日系顧問最高機能爲目的者云。</p>
<h3>靑年勞動營　今日行入營式</h3>
<p>垻六日中央社電　新國民新運促進委員會靑年暑期勞動生活營，第二期關訓之各省市男女職業靑年，共一百餘名，業已先後抵京，辦理報到入營手續。茲悉該營於六日舉行個別談話，並分別審查學員調查表，決定各級正副隊長事宜。定七日上午五時舉行入營式，將由副營長許錫慶氏親臨主持，以示隆重。</p>
<h3>國定敎科書　擬增定價二倍</h3>
<p>南京六日中央社電　敎育部編訂之國定敎科書，自委託上海中國聯合出版公司印刷以來，預定各學校開學前，當可發售。刻因報紙來源缺乏，黑市高漲，該公司方而擬增加原定價格二倍。敎育部鑒於開學在即，課本之發售乃爲急不容緩之事，故與該公司對上項問題正在商榷巾，務使八月底得發售全國各校應用。</p>
<h3>日小磯新內閣　完成第一目標　向突破戰局之途邁進</h3>
<p>東京六日中央社電　日政府爲與陸海軍統帥府緊密協和，五日特廢止向來政府大本營聞之聯絡會議，設立最高戰爭指導會議，以之厘定指導戰爭之根本方針，並調整軍政兩略，於是日新內閣組閣之第一目標遂吿完成。從此日政府當集中全力完成戰爭，不久響應決戰勢態之緊急重要施策，將可迅速確立見諸實施。日政府之施策，殆即如小磯首相。米內海相日前於閣議中所述在於昂揚民氣，明朗輿論，急速增强空軍戰力，且着重使國務之運營强力化簡素化，謀軍需生產及飛躍增强食糧增產等，即當闡明完成戰爭之決意，而向突破戰局之途邁進</p>
<h3>日新首相　小磯大將的生平</h3>
<p>兼容並蓄</p>
<p>小磯國昭大將，在其政治家的風度上，富於火阻率直，可進則進，可行則行的勇氣與實行力，而在另一方面，有兼容並蓋的包容力，這政治家所不可缺的要素，氏的本質上都具備了。在陸軍中積功累進，壓經磨練，曾任陸軍次官，關東軍參謀長，當滿洲事變前後及滿洲國建國時，爲建設東亞新秩序的先驅，繼爲朝鮮軍司令官，二次任拓務大臣，氏的政治手腕，在中央頗獲好評。最近二年來在刺鮮總督任內的治績，鞏固了大將之政治的地位。</p>
<p>朝鮮之虎</p>
<p>小磯大將山形縣出身，今年六十五歲，經山形中學，陸軍士官學校第十二期卒業，與杉山元，烟俊六，柳川平助，二宮治重，牛島貞雄等諸將領爲同期生。歷任參謀本部課長，航空本部總務部長，陸軍省整備局長，事務局長，陸軍次官，繼爲關東軍參謀長，盡力於滿洲事變的處理後，任第五師團長，更累進爲朝鮮軍司令官。昭和十三年，榮授陸軍大將，有「朝鮮之虎」的諢號，倚畁頗殷。在任二年八個月，昭和十三年七月，板　任陸相時，編入預備役，自此即爲政界的惑星，爲人注目。十四年四月，平沼內閣時，人閣爲拓務大臣，十五年一月，米內內閣誕生，再任拓務大臣，十六年四月，爲滿洲移住協會理事長，十七年五月，親任朝鮮總督，以至今日。</p>
<p>中學的畢業成績爲第八名，入陸軍士官學校時，以候補入學，卒業時中等。陸大卒業時，成續中上。所謂大器晚成，中學時代，沉默拘謹，磊落而頭腦細密，級友稱之爲「智多星」，平沼內閣中，入閣爲拓相，致就任詞時說：「本來政治的要諦，在於貫徹國民的最下層，把握其所願所思。切忌官僚游離，獨斷獨行以處理各般行政。上下不和，紊亂行政之本。」這裏顯出了政治家小磯的面目。</p>
<p>調解能手</p>
<p>米內內閣中任拓相時，議會開會中，物野良三代議士與烟陸相因軍事預算辯論甚烈，兩者正想正面衝突時，小磯出頭調解，圓滿解決此塲爭論，院內頗獲好評。又第二次近衛內閣時，日荷交涉進爭時，近衛首相以小磯大將爲特派使節。對此，大將以日荷交涉的成否，毫無把握，萬一交涉決裂，政府是否有決心强欲突進，毫無所知，故拒絕爲特派使節。</p>
<p>日德義三國同盟條約締結時，大將在背後推進奔走，顯示了大將對軸心外交的立塲。朝鮮總督時，標榜確立道義朝鮮，避免空立政綱。一般統治方針，取之於遊歷後視各的熱誠與民衆程度而極力謀其充實。其重心特別是國體本義的透澈，吏道的刷新，及根據朝鮮固有地理條件的產業經濟施策之滲透。二年間的政績斐然可觀。民衆程度漸次向上，穀倉及重工業基地的發展，成續頗佳。朝鮮徵兵制度之實施，亦在氏的總督時代。</p>
<p>事親至孝</p>
<p>另一方面，大將以孝親著稱。着了軍服，背負年邁父親乘車，細心照料，入浴時洗濯周到。軍務局長時代，爲八十餘老母在葉山建屋一軒使居。在豪快的一面，有着厚濃的人情味。往年嗜酒，斗酒不辭，醉則歌自作鴨綠江曲，歌聲曼妙，有「河鹿」之號。</p>
<p>今際此關家危急存亡之秋，有着卓越的識見與力量，政治手腕，及富於人情的大將，怎樣集結總力，向最後勝利邁進，實為全體國民所一致期待者。（譯自七月二十一日朝日新聞）</p>
<h3>東綫德軍反攻　戰局漸趨穩定　華沙東方蘇軍被包圍</h3>
<p>柏林六日中央社電　德元首行營發表，　爾巴阡山麓及維斯杜拉河套德軍之反攻，已將蘇軍擊退，蘇軍佔領者僅為米里克及瓦爾加西南方地區，德軍正對該兩地區反攻中。華沙東方之德陸軍親衛隊與洪牙利降陸傘戰車師團，已將蘇軍包圍，蘇軍正在强頑抵抗中，於該方面蘇軍之牽制作戰已失敗。布格河中流與梅梅爾中間地區，蘇軍仍繼續進攻，突破企圖大致已遭失敗，敵形成之數處突出部，現仍激戰中。</p>
<p>柏林六日中央社電　德軍當局五日發表：蘇軍在東部戰綫暫時無大規模之進攻，僅以有力部隊企岡向瓦爾加西方之維斯杜拉河橋頭堡及東普魯士國境地區之斯道因休根地區西進。華沙附近之戰爭，與一週前全然不同，蘇軍之攻勢層被德軍擊退，目下蘇軍在該地採取守勢。</p>
<h3>北法美軍企圖　攻比斯開灣　德要塞嚴陣以待</h3>
<p>柏林六日中央社訊　德軍當局發表：美軍於阿弗朗契地方亘二十公里之戰踐上　突破德軍陣地，更突入布爾達尼斯，固屬事實，但美軍刻尙未收獲足以影響戰局之重要戰果。倫納區目下仍有戰事，美軍正陸續增調戰車及機械化步兵部隊。夏特布里安地方仍在德軍掌握。羅爾河北岸德軍之抵抗轉趨激烈，致使向　特方而進攻之美軍先鋒部隊陸續後退。又自倫納方面向西進攻之美軍，尙未到達比斯開灣，刻比斯開灣沿岸德軍要塞正嚴陣以待。</p>
<p>柏林六日中央社電　德軍當局三日發表：美軍之進擊布列塔尼半島，係與反軸心軍以巴黎爲目的之最初作戰目標完全相反之一種表現，蓋此次作戰目標之變更，並非出於反軸心軍司令部自身之意志，而是由於法北部戰綫德軍運用戰術之結果。良以德軍之戰術，係在加强塞納橋頭堡之東翼，並在該方面使豫備軍作戰。據一般觀察，由於德軍之强力防禦，英軍之前進呈膠着狀態，以後美軍遂轉而進擊布列塔尼，進德軍令已能由橋頭堡之東翼，派遣預備軍赴布列塔尼，最近兩軍在布列塔尼之攻防兵力，從其比例上觀，實於德軍有利。目下布列塔尼方面美戰車隊仍未能形成統一之戰綫，五日似仍在各地區單獨戰鬥，美軍如不能迅速獲得豫備軍之增援則其進擊勢將無效。</p>
<p>海峽島嶼仍在德手</p>
<p>柏林六日中央社電　德軍當局五日發表：反軸心軍至今仍未有藉海運向布列塔尼運輸物資之企圖，至柯坦汀半島西岸海峽諾島，仍在德軍手中，聖馬羅港亦在此等島嶼砲台之射程圈內。</p>
<p>侵歐軍隊損失重大</p>
<p>瑞典京城六日中央社電　德國社訊：據反軸心司令部之報吿稱，截至七月三十日止，反軸心軍在諾曼第之損失共計十一萬七千人，在此時期內，英軍之損失為三九·五九四人，美軍損失共七〇·〇〇九人，加拿大軍則損失六·五四五人。</p>
<p>柏林六日中央社電　據德西歐軍司令部發表：反軸心軍在三日及四日之戰鬥中，已喪失戰車四百輛，其中四分之三爲獅型戰車。</p>
<p>柏林六日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：據軍界息，美軍數千人及坦克軍數百輛，於八月三日之前夕，在塞納灣因船隻失事而喪失，又有英巡艦一艘，於被擊中後數分鐘內沉沒，水兵死者數百人。</p>
<h3>日軍協助　滬巿食米配給　宣部發言人表示感佩</h3>
<p>南京六日中央社電　國民政府宜傳部發言人，爲盟邦軍部當局協助滬市恢復市民食米配給，發表談話如次：　上海市民因食米配給制度停頓，糧食恐慌現象不僅影響於上海一地。蓋上海爲全國工業之中心，市民食米發生問題，直接影響物價狂漲，工資昂騰，以至波及全國物價大受刺激。是以此嚴重問題，不特爲上海局部之問題也。　盟邦軍部對我國經濟之協力，先從協助滬市政府解決上海民食問題起，實爲最有意義之措置。因上海地區重要，其經濟波動，足以影響全國，上海之食糧經濟得能安定，則全國亦受其影響。吾人對於盟邦軍部此種熱忱協力解決滬市民食問題之措施，實感欣佩。　在大東亞戰爭以後，洋米來源斷絕，內地米糧供給亦感困難，因道路交通阻礙，且最大之產米地區，如豫湘等地，仍多在抗戰及游擊混亂狀態之下，糧食不易供給上海及各工業都市。此次盟邦當局發動豫湘軍事行動，不僅剷除英美在華所建之軍事恭地，同時解除米區混亂狀態，使米源能源源而來，此後我國經濟之調劑更爲容易。　今次滬市食米配給，雖得盟邦協力，得以相當解決，仍望滬地市民更應協力當局，維持米價之安定，厲行糧食節約，嚴防好商囤積操縱，應知滬地民食問題，足以影響於全國整個物價之波動也。</p>
<h3>義境德軍退守　阿諾河北岸　孟都遭恐怖空襲</h3>
<p>柏林六日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：英軍於星期五未能繼續對佛羅倫斯作大規模之攻擊，但已綫為迫近阿諾河之南，有數處之德後衛隊，已被迫撤至阿諾河北　，</p>
<p>米蘭六日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：英美機於星期六對孟（Mantua）施行恐怖襲擊，致該城各處受嚴重損害，著名之聖安特魯敎堂及許多有歷史性之紀念物均受重創。</p>
<h3>土耳其各城巿　準備疏散居民</h3>
<p>安加拉六日中央社電　海通社訊：土耳其政府現已向國民議會提出疏散若干城市之法案。</p>
<p>德土絕交蘇持緘默</p>
<p>柏林六日中央社電　海通社訊，德外交部發言人稱：德土斷絕邦交後，蘇聯嚴守緘默，殊堪懷疑。就過去之經騐言，蘇聯保持緘默時，常有更多之要求，蘇聯曾要求土國之根據地，似爲土國人士所反對，渠等深慮蘇聯一旦染指，將得寸進尺也。英美是否要求根據地，英美之要求是否與蘇聯之要求衝突，該發言人未加答覆，而安那托利亞建築飛機塲，均由英國工程師監督云。</p>
<h3>德國社黨　幹部會議　檢討總動員施策</h3>
<p>柏林六日中央社電　德國社黨幹事長包爾曼氏，基於七月二十五日之元首令，爲檢討計劃澈底之動員施策，三日特於柏林召朱國社黨全國指導者，及地方新導者舉行全體會議。於總力動員總監郭培爾博士之主持下，歷時兩日，詳加討論實施方策，於四日已行閉會。郭培爾在會議席上，關於澈底動員之龐大施策說明如次：德國民於國內蘊藏有巨大之作戰力，如能將此完全動員時，德國可始終立於不敗之地位，發揮德國之總力，不但爲刻下全國民之急務，乃指導層保特名譽之新任務，亦德國中上最重大之難向，德國民必須一至奮起。又軍需部長施貝爾博士詳述德軍需工業至現在發展之過程如次：德國軍需工業固需增强生產，同時於技術上亦必須優於敵軍，不但質與量當須豐富，同時又必需將多數兵士送往前綫，德國民如能動員所有之預備戰力，決定能當此任，於技術方面德國如能始終把握機會，最後勝利定可指日而待。最後爲內長希姆萊以國內軍總司令之資格，亘數小時說明七月二十日事件之因委，及今後國內軍司令部之方針及施策，其詞有言，決定社國將來之此次大戰，乃民族之聖戰，國社黨與國民必須渾然一體，較往時更加團結，以克服諸多困難，導戰局於有利地位。</p>
<h3>蓋倫堡氏調任要識</h3>
<p>柏林六日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：德軍備及戰時生產部彈藥司司長蓋倫堡，已由希特勒元首委任主持極重要之作戰任務，並賦與特別權力。</p>
<h3>滿洲煤產激增</h3>
<p>新京六日中央社電　據滿洲煤炭協　會調查本年度第一期（四至六月）煤之生產狀况，至冬季緊急增產期間，各煤鑛仍將繼續保持最優成績，除二三小煤鑛稍嫌遜色外，大部均極良好，已獲預期成績，較之去年第一期進步尤多。入七八月後，更克服旣往夏季之減產情形，去年夏季煤之缺乏狀况，今年已安全消除，雖有關之勞力資材等日漸惡化，但仍能收獲極好成績。蓋以政府措置得當，故各煤鑛之增產得收實效，最近大煤鑛之勞工能率驟行增强，實爲其主要原因。</p>

<h3>日宇佐美公使　昨招待林部長　互祝新聞協會完成使命</h3>
<p>盟邦日本駐華全權公使宇佐美氏，以國府宣傳部林部長暨中央電訊社長郭秀峰氏，此次為主持設立中國新聞協會蒞滬，特於昨晚七時在百老匯大厦設宴招待。除到林部長暨郭社長外，尚有中央社副社長胡瀛洲，上海分社主任褚保衡，報業經理處主任伍鱗趾，中華日報代社長許力求，平報社長金雄白，新中國報總主筆魯風，國民新聞社長黃敬齊，新聞報副經理福仲權，本報社長陳彬麻，及日陸軍報道部出淵部長，大使館　崎參事官，情報部松平部長，福間副領事等二十餘人。席間首由宇佐美公使起立致詞云：「此次林部長閣下及中央電訊社郭社長因設立中國新聞協會而來滬，今夕本人藉此機會，略備粗餐，招待中國新聞協會籌備委員及宣傳報道界之代表者，而閣下及諸位先生在此時局多端，酷暑侵入之際，尚能撥冗惠臨，是本人最為榮幸的</p>
<p>宇佐美公使詞</p>
<p>據聞昨日籌備參員會第一次會議結果，極為同情，不日即將成立該協會，本人對此林部長閣下及關係諸位的努力，深為感佩，同時祈望今後更加努力。</p>
<p>像現在戰爭踏入決戰階段之時，思想戰之所佔重要性，固不待喋喋詳論，不過關於這點本人願向閣下及諸位先生縷述平常所懷之一二，以供參考。</p>
<p>關於思想戰之最重要者，乃是確立統一的思想，將此思想去普及徹底的鞏固的組織，關於前者曩因大東亞共同宣言之發表，而得確立共通於大東亞各國之思想，同時此思想之基調，乃在解放果亞，完成東亞各國獨立目主，各國於國際間之平等，是勿須贅言的。</p>
<p>然而為要徹底普及此思想有着個個的宜傳報道的關努力奮鬥，但是個個的機關，如果在一盤散沙的狀態之下，即使怎樣努力，決不會集中力量以收其十二分的効果。不但如此，偶而更有會引起思想上的對立發生相反的惡果之危險。所以在實施宣傳報道工作之際，除了確立思想之外，最重要者乃是確立組織，這是諸位先生早已知道的。然而在此為了真正的戰爭，將要傾注最大努力之際，有由負着指導與論之重責的，各報社為了擴大强化其組織，將近組織新聞協會之喜訊，實在一無一任同慶之至。日方報社之對此，欣然參加，自不待言，本大使館期與陸海軍方面共同與以最大的協力，以期在思想戰上，同樣的獲得勝利。在此意味上，再向各位籌備委員希望今後的努力，茲舉杯敬祝閣下及各位光生之健康與奮鬥，並祝思想戰的完成」。</p>
<p>林部長致答辭</p>
<p>繼由林部長致答詞云：「今日承榮公使盛大招寡，兄弟謹代表被請中日報界同仁致謝意。大東亞戰爭已進入決戰階段，在此時期實傳戰，尤占重要地位，兄弟此次與郭一社長來滬，目的在籌設中國新聞協會，盟邦大使館以及陸海軍之報導當局，多與以指導協力，殊不勝感激。按宣傳報導工作之最重要問題，為堅固意志與集巾力量，倘能具備兩條件，必能達到所期待之成果。兄弟昨日參與新聞聞協會備委員會，而深知官方與新聞界均能同心協力，中國新聞界亦能統一步驟，且中日雙方新聞界，亦能采取完全問一之意志與步驟，以此觀之，此次有關新聞協會之報界同仁均能本於中心緊要之問題，合付統一意志與集中力量之基本原則，彼此携手協力，以期貫澈初衷。宣傳戰之目標，自在擊滅央美，在促醒重慶之覺悟，但除此之外，吾人尤宜注視上海，上海為謠言滋生之地，故首先須使上海宣傳機構强化，以期獲得宣傳效果，最後兄弟謹代表中國宣傳同仁對盟邦當局數年來援助我國宣傳事業之熱誠，同時盼望今後仍加倍丁以援助與指導，以期達成宦傳目的，襲滅英美」云云。詞墨進　，至十時許　主盡歡而散。</p>

<h3>本市食米　到數極旺</h3>
<p>本市食米，因新榖即將登塲，近郊一帶農紛將陳米出售，到數極旺，市况平疲。最近本市米商万面在蕪湖所採辦之大批米糧，退價每石僅三千餘元，首批已於昨（六）日抵埠，計四千八百七十五石，當即儲入浙江興業指定倉庫，其餘均在一陸啓運中，不日即可到滬，眾料木市米價將再有續跌可能。</p>
<h3>農產物品　源源運滬　上週物價趨勢穩定</h3>
<p>本市上週間物價趨勢，頗無顯著　動，大　均在原價盤旋中，良係米價頻落，人心安定，及各業銀根未能鬆弛所致，同時一般囤戶咸以所囤物資為時已久，亟欲按照現今市價出籠，是以各物現貨供應籌碼已顯然增加不少。故百業市况將特久安定，惟經濟當局對於澈查工作，仍未稍趨鬆弛。記者昨向各業方面探悉，最近一月以來，各地農產品運滬頗絡繹於途，此項物品大都由各業統制會設法以物物交換而來，事前將本市製成品先行運至各地，交換當地重要農產物品，然後即將此等農產品循水陸兩路運抵此間，　給各架大小工廠應用，藉作　貨原料，故本市物資原料尚稱充裕。</p>
<h3>節約運動與　防犯的關係　李司法處長廣播演說</h3>
<p>上海特別市節約協會為積極推行節約運動，舉行定期廣播，昨日下午七時四十五分，時話市警察局司法處長李時雨假大上海電合廣播「節約運動與防犯工作之關係」，略謂：節約運動在使人民養成儉僕的風氣，平日節省物質，以增强國家戰時力量。本人站在司法警察的立塲上，是應該協力來推進這個運動，因為我們在平日偵查犯罪的時候，十有八九是由於奢侈麋費的享受，與不正當的生活所引起，亦可以說奢侈糜賣就是犯罪的因素。所以要澈底防止犯罪，維持社會安寗，便應該肅淸那班祇知享樂不知守法的份子。</p>
<p>最近本處為秉承陳市長意志協力建設大上海所以決定先從澄淸社會罪惡處做起，展開了防犯工作。我們防犯的對象固然是着重社會一般不守法的述氓惡棍以及貪污剝削者，但是我們為使這一個工作做得澈底起見，對於留對於不正當樂塲所花天酒地間的浪費份子，亦決不輕於放裏，因為度着不正當生活的人是最容易走上犯罪的歧途。</p>
<p>初步防犯工作</p>
<p>防犯工作有一句口話呌做「防犯於未然，維獲法律尊嚴，保節各推進，同時更指出「協助當當局防止犯罪便是保障自己安全」。這一句話說得更明　，原來防犯工作的展開協力，大家來研究的，我以為節約運動便是協力防犯遝動，但是專靠空論是沒有用的，所以我更以為市民如果能人人勵行節約便已做到初步防犯工作，一面我們對於上海一般罔顧法律，專以暴利剝削人民為自己享受打算的不法商人們，希望市民予以檢舉，繩之以法，使他們從此劍跡。同時防犯科對於一切銷金窟式的娛樂塲所，已實行監視取締，務使人人節約，人人守法，那末人民既可養成自已節儉的美德，更可協力我們完成肅淸不良份子及减少犯罪的目的。但是我以為無論那一種運動都要以誘導，控制，補救的三種力量去推行，方能收到成效，僅以空論宣傳是不够的，希望諸位親愛的市民們大家切實的勵行節約，努力防犯。</p>

        <h1>1944 - n216</h1>
<h3>Psychological Wartime System</h3>
<p>Mr. Tokutomi Sohō, a veteran of the Japanese press, published an essay entitled "A Moment of Emergency," which was translated and published in this newspaper yesterday. The most important sentence in it is the wartime system of mind and reason. He said, "As long as there is spirit, knowledge, and courage, I will go forward even if there are tens of millions of people." It turns out that the power of the spirit, as the ancient Chinese saying goes, where sincerity reaches, metal and stone will open, is higher than all material power and is the guide of all material power.</p>
<p>What is a wartime system psychologically? First, we must firmly believe that this Greater East Asia War is a revolutionary liberation war, and victory is beyond doubt. Second, we must understand that this is an arduous war that requires extreme endurance, perseverance, and hard work. In other words, the psychological wartime system consists first of confidence in victory and second of determination to work. Without confidence in victory, there can be no enthusiasm for work, and without determination to work, there can be no final victory.</p>
<p>Shanghai is a city with the most rumors. All kinds of rumors are most likely to shake the public's beliefs and affect the public's efforts at work. However, Shanghai is the center of Chinese culture and economy. The psychological changes of the general public in Shanghai and the efforts they put into their work are all related to the overall situation. Now that the situation is becoming more and more serious and rumors are increasing, the impact is even greater. Because of this problem, we are extremely anxious. We are concerned about the future of the East Asian situation, and we are even more willing to use our greatest strength to awaken the citizens of Shanghai to create a wartime system psychologically.</p>
<p>At present, the most important thing is that those with confidence should contact the public at all times and use their own confidence to awaken mutual trust among the public, and from mutual trust among the public, progress to mutual assistance among the public. Wasn't Dr. Sun Yat-sen's revolution first started by one initiator, slowly gathering many comrades, and then gaining the support and cooperation of the public to succeed? If you are not firm in your confidence, then don't think about the success of your career, and don't think about others' trust. You should immediately withdraw from the front line and not hinder others' progress. If you have a strong sense of confidence, you should stand up and use your own psychological wartime system to transform everyone's psychological wartime system.</p>
<p>Secondly, those with the determination to work hard now need to show their work to everyone, lead by example, and move forward bravely. The development of the situation may still encounter more difficult situations, but the progress of work should be more diligent because of the difficulties. The performance of work is by no means a matter of words or papers, but all real achievements that are beneficial to the country and the nation. To hope that others are determined to work hard, you must first set an example of working hard yourself. In this way, those above will lead first, and those below will naturally follow. The principle of success in a career is nothing more than this: one person's determination to work hard can motivate many people's determination to work hard, and the determination to work hard of a few people can motivate the determination to work hard of the entire society.</p>
<p>The last five minutes of a long-term war are the most tense situation, but the justice of those engaged in the liberation struggle will eventually eliminate the ambition of the invaders, and the continuous efforts of the liberation fighters will eventually lead to the natural collapse of the invaders. Mr. Tokutomi said, "As long as we have determination, we are not afraid of anyone, and nothing is worrying."</p>
<h3>Land and Air Battles on Omiya Island; More Than a Thousand Enemy Troops Annihilated; Japanese Troops Hold Defensive Line Northeast of Akashi Bay</h3>
<p>Central News Agency from a certain base in the mid-Pacific: The Japanese garrison on Omiya Island is currently engaged in a bloody land and air battle with the enemy. Among them, the spirit of the company led by Lieutenant Ishii of the Army fighting bravely against the enemy is most admirable. Since Lieutenant Ishii and his men landed on Akashi Bay on the island, they have been fighting alone to stop the enemy from advancing for six days and nights, causing the enemy to suffer as many as a thousand casualties. At the same time, Ishii's troops also fell one after another, so the enemy continued to suffer casualties, and finally almost reached a state of complete annihilation, but they still fought bravely to defend the stockade. They are currently preparing a new front-line command unit active in the northeast of Akashi Bay.</p>
<h3>Japanese Navy Secures Waterway Transportation on Xiang River; Battle of Hengyang Reaches Climax</h3>
<p>Central News Agency from a certain front-line base of the Japanese army on the 6th: The Japanese naval forces assisting in the Hunan operation have now secured the waterway from Dongting Lake to the Xiang River, making a great contribution to the rear transportation of the army. On July 7, the Xiang River retrograde unit even went directly to Hengyang, the focus of the Hunan operation. Securing the waterway ensures that the army does not have to worry about the rear. On June 6 and 17, the Yujun strongholds along the Xiang River in Yingtian and Jinggang were first suppressed. The elite of the retrograde unit has opened up more than 300 kilometers of waterways in more than 40 days since the start of the operation, and the Yujun has tried to obstruct it in various ways. In mid-July, hundreds of Yu-American aircraft attacked along the Xiang River. Also in that month, the Japanese army disposed of more than 100 mines laid by the Yujun. Recently, due to the activity of the army's air force, the YU-American air force's actions have been completely suppressed. The Japanese naval forces are now on high alert to ensure the waterway.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 6th: The battle for Hengyang has reached its climax. As the Japanese army's offensive intensifies, the Yujun seems to feel that it is approaching the final moment, and has recently repeatedly revealed lamentations about defending Hengyang. According to a Reuters dispatch from Chongqing on the 4th, a Yujun affairs officer said that the situation in Hengyang city was still chaotic. Due to the fierce hand-to-hand combat that has lasted for more than a month, the Yujun corpses were lying everywhere, and there was no time to bury and transport them, causing a foul odor. The Yu reinforcements are continuing to reinforce Hengyang from the southwest, west, and north, and their vanguard troops have reached a location four kilometers away from Hengyang. Because the Japanese army has opened up Changsha and Hengshan, and a large army is advancing southward, it is expected that it will launch another large-scale attack soon.</p>
<h3>Japanese Wings Political Association Strengthens Cooperation with Government</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 6th: After Mr. Kobayashi, an admiral of the Navy, succeeded as the president of the Japanese Wings Political Association, the progress of the association's affairs will be further strengthened due to President Kobayashi's detached determination. The association plans to hold a general meeting of members, at which President Kobayashi will express his views, which will surely give the members exceptional inspiration. In addition, President Kobayashi plans to start by reorganizing the personnel structure, and then use the full power of the Wings Political Association to cooperate closely with the government, shoulder the heavy responsibility of wartime political associations, and move toward victory. Under this major turning point, what the Wings Political Association wants from the government is to clarify the government's policy direction to China and foreign countries. The reason is that the Japanese people's hearts have been renewed and the united Koiso-Yonai coalition cabinet has emerged. It is time to take this opportunity to show the empire's unwavering determination to the outside world and make 100 million people rise up together internally. At this time, the two houses of nobility and衆議院 can also show their determination to support the government in the people's place of production, and at the same time, they can represent the people to actively launch public discussion with the government to fulfill the reality of supporting貴。</p>
<h3>Japanese Industrial Council Decides on Three Policies</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 6th: In order to meet the urgent needs of wartime, the Japan Important Industry Association has formulated three policies under the close combination of operations and production, in order to sign and command the highest level of wartime production: Establish the function of the Wartime Production Design Headquarters. Utilize the knowledge and experience of the industrial world and stimulate a high degree of production will. Strengthen and apply air defense countermeasures. On the 5th, the main points were presented to the government, and efforts were made to recruit outstanding talents from the government and the people, as well as representatives from the control associations or other industrial departments, to jointly strike the army and navy's unified operations, to establish production plans, and to comprehensively determine the policies for production and distribution, and to adjust the combined procurement and sales procedures, as the basic purpose. The assertion that the function of the Wartime Production Design Headquarters should be established is very noteworthy.</p>
<h3>Beiping New People's Association Holds Advisory Meeting</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Beijing, 5th: The general meeting of the New People's Association-affiliated Advisory Meeting was held at the New People's Association Public Residence in Dongjiaomin Lane, Beiping, starting at 10 a.m. on the 5th. Under the participation of Supreme Advisor Iwamatsu and representatives of various related military and civilians, various discussions were held. It is reported that the main purpose of the meeting is to adapt to the decisive battle situation, form a common Sino-Japanese-Manchu battle line, increase production, and promote the highest function of Japanese advisors.</p>
<h3>Youth Labor Camp Entrance Ceremony Today</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Ba, 6th: The second phase of training for the youth summer labor life camp of the New National New Movement Promotion Committee, with more than 100 male and female vocational youths from various provinces and cities, have arrived in Beijing one after another and completed the registration and entry procedures. It is learned that the camp will hold individual talks on the 6th, review the student survey forms separately, and decide on the matters of the captains and vice-captains at all levels. The entrance ceremony will be held at 5 a.m. on the 7th, and Deputy Camp Director Xu Xiqing will personally preside over it to show the grand occasion.</p>
<h3>National Textbook Planned to Increase Price by Two Times</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th: The national textbooks compiled by the Ministry of Education have been entrusted to the Shanghai China United Publishing Company for printing, and it is expected that they can be sold before the opening of schools. Now, due to the lack of newspaper sources and high prices on the black market, the company plans to increase the original price by two times. In view of the imminent opening of schools, the Ministry of Education believes that the sale of textbooks is a matter of urgency, so it is discussing the above issues with the company in order to ensure that they can be sold to schools across the country for application by the end of August.</p>
<h3>Japanese Koiso New Cabinet Completes First Goal and Advances Toward Breaking Through the Battle Situation</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 6th: In order to closely coordinate with the Army and Navy General Staff Headquarters, the Japanese government abolished the liaison meeting that had always been heard by the government's General Headquarters on the 5th, and established the Supreme War Guidance Conference to determine the fundamental policy for guiding the war and adjust the military and political strategies. Thus, the first goal of the new cabinet's formation was completed that day. From now on, the Japanese government will concentrate all its efforts to complete the war. Before long, emergency and important measures to respond to the decisive battle situation will be quickly established and implemented. The Japanese government's policy is almost as stated by Prime Minister Koiso and Navy Minister Yonai in the cabinet meeting a few days ago. It lies in boosting morale, clarifying public opinion, rapidly increasing air force combat power, and emphasizing the strengthening and simplification of state affairs, seeking to increase military production and leapfrog food production. That is, to clarify the determination to complete the war and move toward breaking through the battle situation.</p>
<h3>Profile of Japan's New Prime Minister, General Koiso</h3>
<p>Inclusiveness</p>
<p>General Koiso Kuniaki, in his demeanor as a politician, is full of courage and practical power to advance if he can advance and act if he can act. On the other hand, he has an inclusive and inclusive power, which is an indispensable element for politicians, and is possessed by his nature. He has accumulated meritorious service in the army and has been tempered. He has served as the Vice Minister of the Army and the Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army. During the Manchurian Incident and the founding of Manchuguo, he was a pioneer in building a new order in East Asia. He then served as the commander of the Korean Army and twice as the Minister of Colonial Affairs. His political skills were well received in the central government. His achievements as the Governor-General of Korea for the past two years have consolidated the general's political position.</p>
<p>Tiger of Korea</p>
<p>General Koiso is from Yamagata Prefecture and is 65 years old this year. He graduated from Yamagata Middle School, the 12th term of the Army Officer School. He was a classmate of Generals Sugiyama Gen, Yan Junroku, Yanagawa Heisuke, Ninomiya Jiju, and Ushijima Sadao. He has served as the chief of the General Staff Headquarters, the chief of the General Affairs Department of the Aviation Headquarters, the director of the Equipment Bureau of the Ministry of the Army, the director of the Secretariat, the Vice Minister of the Army, and then the Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army. After doing his best to deal with the Manchurian Incident, he was appointed the commander of the 5th Division, and then promoted to the commander of the Korean Army. In Showa 13 (1938), he was awarded the title of Army General and had the nickname "Tiger of Korea," which was highly praised. After serving for two years and eight months, in July of Showa 13 (1938), when Itagaki任 was the Minister of the Army, he was incorporated into the reserve service, and since then he has been a planet in the political world and has attracted attention. In April of Showa 14 (1939), he was appointed Minister of Colonial Affairs in the Hiranuma Cabinet. In January of Showa 15 (1940), when the Yonai Cabinet was born, he was re-appointed Minister of Colonial Affairs. In April of Showa 16 (1941), he became the chairman of the Manchuria Immigration Association. In May of Showa 17 (1942), he personally served as the Governor-General of Korea, until today.</p>
<p>His graduation score in middle school was eighth. When he entered the Army Officer School, he entered as a candidate. He graduated in the middle grade. When he graduated from the Army University, his performance was above average. The so-called great talent matures late. In middle school, he was silent and restrained, upright and meticulous. His classmates called him "Zhuge Liang." When he joined the Hiranuma Cabinet as the Minister of Colonial Affairs, he said in his inaugural speech: "The essence of politics lies in penetrating the lowest level of the people and grasping what they want and think. It is imperative to avoid officials from being alienated and making decisions arbitrarily to handle various administrative matters. Disunity between superiors and subordinates will disrupt the foundation of administration." This shows the face of politician Koiso.</p>
<p>A Master of Mediation</p>
<p>When he was the Minister of Colonial Affairs in the Yonai Cabinet, Representative Monono Ryosuke and Army Minister Yan argued fiercely about the military budget in the parliament. Just as the two were about to clash head-on, Koiso came forward to mediate and satisfactorily resolved the dispute, which was highly praised in the House. Also, during the Second Konoe Cabinet, when the Japanese-Dutch negotiations were in progress, Prime Minister Konoe appointed General Koiso as a special envoy. In this regard, the general had no confidence in the success or failure of the Japanese-Dutch negotiations, and did not know whether the government was determined to break through if the negotiations broke down, so he refused to be a special envoy.</p>
<p>When the Tripartite Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy was concluded, the general ran around behind the scenes to promote it, showing the general's position on Axis diplomacy. When he was the Governor-General of Korea, he advocated establishing a moral Korea and avoiding empty political programs. The general ruling policy was to draw on the enthusiasm of visiting and seeing each place and to strive for its fulfillment according to the level of the people. The focus is especially on the thorough understanding of the essence of the national polity, the renewal of officialdom, and the penetration of industrial and economic measures based on Korea's inherent geographical conditions. The political achievements in two years were remarkable. The level of the people is gradually increasing, and the development of granaries and heavy industry bases is excellent. The implementation of the Korean conscription system was also during his tenure as governor-general.</p>
<p>Filial Piety</p>
<p>On the other hand, the general is known for his filial piety. He put on his military uniform, carried his elderly father on the train, and took care of him carefully. He took meticulous care of him when he took a bath. During his time as the director of the Military Affairs Bureau, he built a house for his 80-year-old mother in Hayama to live in. In the bold side, there is a deep human touch. In the past, he loved to drink, and he would not refuse a jug of wine. When he was drunk, he would sing his own Yalu River song, and his singing was beautiful, earning him the nickname "Kajika."</p>
<p>Now, at this critical moment of national crisis, the general, with his outstanding insight, strength, political skills, and rich human touch, how will he gather all his strength and move towards final victory? This is what all the people unanimously expect. (Translated from the Asahi Shimbun, July 21)</p>
<h3>German Counterattack on Eastern Front Gradually Stabilizes Battle Situation; Soviet Troops East of Warsaw Surrounded</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 6th: German Headquarters announced that the German counterattack on the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains and the Vistula River has repelled the Soviet troops. The Soviet troops only occupy the areas southwest of Mirik and Warga. German troops are counterattacking these two areas. The German Army Guards and the Hungarian airborne tank division east of Warsaw have surrounded the Soviet troops. The Soviet troops are resisting stubbornly. In that area, the Soviet troops' diversionary operations have failed. In the area between the middle reaches of the Bug River and Memel, the Soviet troops are still continuing to attack. The attempt to break through has largely failed. Heavy fighting is still going on in several salients formed by the enemy.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 6th: German military authorities announced on the 5th that the Soviet army has no large-scale offensive on the Eastern Front for the time being, and is only attempting to advance westward to the Vistula River bridgehead west of Warga and the Steinshögen area in the East Prussian border area with powerful troops. The war near Warsaw is completely different from a week ago. The Soviet army's offensive has been repelled by the German army, and the Soviet army is now taking a defensive position in the area.</p>
<h3>U.S. Forces in Northern France Attempt to Attack the Bay of Biscay; German Fortress on Alert</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 6th: German military authorities announced: It is true that U.S. forces broke through the German army's positions in the battle zone of 20 kilometers in the Afranche area and even broke into Bourdanis, but the U.S. forces have not yet achieved important results enough to affect the battle situation. There is still fighting in the Rennes area, and U.S. forces are successively increasing their tank and mechanized infantry units. Chateaubriant is still in the hands of the German army. The resistance of the German army on the north bank of the Loire River has become more fierce, causing the vanguard of the U.S. forces attacking in the opposite direction to retreat one after another. In addition, U.S. forces attacking westward from the Rennes area have not yet reached the Bay of Biscay. The German fortresses along the Bay of Biscay are on high alert.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 6th: German military authorities announced on the 3rd that the U.S. forces' attack on the Brittany Peninsula is a completely opposite manifestation of the initial operational goal of the anti-Axis forces taking Paris as their goal. The change in the operational goal is not due to the will of the anti-Axis headquarters itself, but is the result of the German army's use of tactics on the northern French front. The German army's tactics are to strengthen the eastern wing of the Seine bridgehead and to make the reserve army fight in that area. According to general observation, due to the strong defense of the German army, the British army's advance is in a state of stagnation. Later, the U.S. forces turned to attack Brittany, and the German army was able to send reserve troops from the eastern wing of the bridgehead to Brittany. From the perspective of the ratio of the attacking and defending forces in Brittany recently, it is actually favorable to the German army. At present, the U.S. tank teams in Brittany have still not formed a unified battle line, and on the 5th, they seemed to be fighting alone in various areas. If the U.S. forces cannot quickly obtain the support of reserve troops, their attack will be ineffective.</p>
<p>Channel Islands Still in German Hands</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 6th: German military authorities announced on the 5th that the anti-Axis forces still have not attempted to transport supplies to Brittany by sea, and the Channel Islands, including诺 Island off the west coast of the Cotentin Peninsula, are still in the hands of the German army, and the port of Saint-Malo is also within the firing range of the island's artillery.</p>
<p>Heavy Losses for Invading European Troops</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Stockholm, Sweden, 6th: German news agency: According to a report from the anti-Axis headquarters, as of July 30, the anti-Axis forces' losses in Normandy totaled 117,000 men. During this period, the British army's losses were 39,594 men, the U.S. army's losses totaled 70,009 men, and the Canadian army's losses were 6,545 men.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 6th: According to the German Western Army Command, the anti-Axis forces lost 400 tanks in the battles on the 3rd and 4th, three-quarters of which were "Lion" tanks.</p>

<h3>Japanese Army Assists with Rice Rationing in Shanghai; Spokesman for Propaganda Department Expresses Admiration</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th: The spokesman for the Propaganda Department of the National Government issued the following statement regarding the military authorities of the Allied nations assisting Shanghai in restoring rice rationing for citizens: The suspension of the rice rationing system for Shanghai citizens has caused a panic over food, which not only affects Shanghai. Shanghai is the industrial center of the country. Problems with the rice supply for citizens directly affect soaring prices and rising wages, which in turn affect rising prices throughout the country. Therefore, this serious problem is not just a local problem in Shanghai. The Allied military's cooperation with our country's economy, starting with assisting the Shanghai municipal government in solving the problem of Shanghai's food supply, is the most meaningful measure. Because the Shanghai area is important, its economic fluctuations are enough to affect the whole country. If Shanghai's food economy can be stabilized, the whole country will also be affected. We are truly impressed by the Allied military's enthusiastic cooperation in solving the problem of Shanghai's food supply. After the Greater East Asia War, the source of foreign rice was cut off, and the supply of rice from the interior also became difficult. Due to road traffic obstacles, and the largest rice-producing areas, such as Henan and Hunan, are still in a state of anti-Japanese war and guerrilla chaos, it is not easy to supply food to Shanghai and other industrial cities. This time, the Allied authorities launched military operations in Henan and Hunan, not only eliminating the military bases built by Britain and the United States in China, but also relieving the chaotic state of the rice-producing areas, allowing rice sources to flow continuously. From then on, the regulation of our country's economy will be easier. Although the rice rationing in Shanghai this time has been fairly resolved with the cooperation of the Allied nations, it is still hoped that the citizens of Shanghai will cooperate with the authorities to maintain the stability of rice prices, strictly implement food conservation, and strictly prevent unscrupulous merchants from hoarding and manipulating. It should be known that the food problem in Shanghai is enough to affect the price fluctuations throughout the country.</p>

<h3>Turkish Cities Prepare to Evacuate Residents</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Ankara, 6th: Hatong News Agency: The Turkish government has now submitted a bill to the National Assembly to evacuate some cities.</p>
<p>Soviet Union Remains Silent After Germany and Turkey Sever Relations</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 6th: Hatong News Agency: A spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry said that the Soviet Union's silence after Germany and Turkey severed diplomatic relations is suspicious. Based on past experience, when the Soviet Union remains silent, it often has more demands. The Soviet Union has demanded bases in Turkey, which seems to be opposed by the Turkish people, who are deeply concerned that once the Soviet Union gets involved, it will get an inch and want a mile. The spokesman did not answer whether Britain and the United States had demanded bases and whether the demands of Britain and the United States conflicted with the demands of the Soviet Union, but the construction of airfields in Anatolia was supervised by British engineers.</p>
<h3>German Social Party: Cadre Meeting Reviews Total Mobilization Measures</h3>
<p>Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) - Based on the Führer's decree of July 25th, the General Secretary of the German Social Party, Mr. Bormann, convened a plenary meeting on the 3rd in Berlin, attended by national leaders and new regional leaders of the National Socialist Party, to review and thoroughly implement mobilization measures. Under the chairmanship of Dr. Goebbels, Director-General of Total Mobilization, the meeting lasted two days, during which implementation strategies were discussed in detail. The meeting concluded on the 4th. During the meeting, Goebbels explained the vast mobilization measures as follows: The German people possess immense combat power within the country. If this can be fully mobilized, Germany can remain invincible. Unleashing Germany's total strength is not only the urgent task of all citizens but also a new mission to safeguard the reputation of the leadership, as well as the most significant challenge for the German middle and upper classes. The German people must rise up as one. Furthermore, Minister of Armaments Dr. Speer detailed the development of Germany's military-industrial complex to date as follows: Germany's military industry must enhance production and technologically surpass the enemy. Not only should quality and quantity be abundant, but also a large number of soldiers must be sent to the front lines. If the German people can mobilize all reserve combat power, they will undoubtedly be able to fulfill this task. If Germany can consistently seize opportunities in technological advancements, final victory can be expected soon. Finally, Minister of the Interior Himmler, in his capacity as Commander-in-Chief of the Home Army, spent several hours explaining the causes and consequences of the July 20th incident, as well as the future direction and measures of the Home Army Headquarters. He stated that the current great war, which will determine the future of the nation, is a holy war of the nation. The National Socialist Party and the people must be completely united, even more so than before, to overcome numerous difficulties and guide the war to a favorable outcome.</p>
<h3>Galenborg Appointed to Important Position</h3>

<h3>Manchurian Coal Production Increases Sharply</h3>
<p>Xinjing, 6th (Central News Agency) - According to a survey by the Manchurian Coal Association regarding coal production in the first period of this year (April to June), all coal mines will continue to maintain optimal performance during the winter emergency production period. Except for a few small coal mines that are slightly inferior, most are extremely good and have achieved expected results, with even more progress compared to the first period of last year. After entering July and August, the situation of reduced production in the past summer has been overcome. The lack of coal in the summer of last year has been safely eliminated this year. Although related labor and materials are gradually deteriorating, very good results can still be achieved. This is mainly due to the government's proper measures, so the increase in production in various coal mines has achieved practical results. Recently, the labor efficiency of large coal mines has increased sharply, which is the main reason.</p>

<h3>Japanese Minister Usami Hosted Minister Lin Yesterday, Mutually Wishing the News Association to Fulfill Its Mission</h3>
<p>Mr. Usami, the Minister Plenipotentiary of the allied nation Japan to China, hosted a banquet last night at 7:00 PM at the Broadway Mansion, in honor of Minister Lin of the National Government's Propaganda Department and Mr. Guo Xiufeng, President of the Central News Agency, who came to Shanghai to preside over the establishment of the Chinese News Association. In addition to Minister Lin and President Guo, there were also Mr. Hu Yingzhou, Vice President of the Central News Agency; Mr. Chu Baoheng, Director of the Shanghai Branch; Mr. Wu Linzhi, Director of the Newspaper Management Office; Mr. Xu Liqiu, Acting President of the China Daily; Mr. Jin Xiongbo, President of the Ping Bao; Mr. Lu Feng, Editor-in-Chief of the New China News; Mr. Huang Jingqi, President of the National News; Mr. Fu Zhongquan, Deputy Manager of the News; Mr. Chen Binma, President of this newspaper; as well as Mr. Izubuchi, Director of the Japanese Army News Department; Counselor   Saki of the Embassy; Director Matsudaira of the Information Department; Vice-Consul Fukama, and over twenty others. During the banquet, Minister Usami first stood up and delivered a speech, saying: "Minister Lin and President Guo of the Central News Agency have come to Shanghai this time to establish the Chinese News Association. Tonight, I take this opportunity to prepare a simple meal and invite the preparatory committee members of the Chinese News Association and representatives of the propaganda and news circles. I am most honored that you and gentlemen have been able to spare time to attend during this time of multiple crises and intense heat.</p>
<p>Usami's Speech</p>
<p>"I have heard that the results of yesterday's first meeting of the preparatory committee were very harmonious, and the association will soon be established. I deeply admire the efforts of Minister Lin and all those involved and hope that they will continue to work hard in the future.</p>
<p>"As the war enters a decisive stage, the importance of the ideological war need not be elaborated upon. However, I would like to share some of my thoughts on this point with you gentlemen for your reference.</p>
<p>"The most important thing in the ideological war is to establish a unified ideology, to popularize this ideology thoroughly, and to consolidate the organization. Regarding the former, the publication of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration established a common ideology for all countries in Greater East Asia. At the same time, the keynote of this ideology is to liberate Goa, complete the independence and autonomy of East Asian countries, and ensure equality among all countries internationally, which need not be repeated.</p>
<p>"However, in order to thoroughly popularize this ideology, there must be individual efforts in propaganda and reporting. However, if individual organizations are in a state of disunity, no matter how hard they work, they will not be able to concentrate their strength to achieve their full effect. Not only that, but there is even a risk of causing ideological opposition and leading to adverse consequences. Therefore, when implementing propaganda and reporting work, in addition to establishing ideology, the most important thing is to establish an organization, which you gentlemen already know. However, at this time when we are about to devote our greatest efforts to the real war, it is truly gratifying to hear the good news that the newspapers, which bear the heavy responsibility of guiding public opinion, will soon organize a news association in order to expand and strengthen their organizations. The Japanese newspapers will gladly participate, needless to say. This embassy hopes to work together with the army and navy to provide the greatest cooperation in order to achieve victory in the ideological war as well. In this sense, I once again express my hope for the future efforts of all the preparatory committee members. I raise my glass to wish you and all the gentlemen good health and success, and to wish for the completion of the ideological war."</p>
<p>Minister Lin's Reply</p>
<p>Minister Lin then gave a reply, saying: "Today, I am honored to have Minister Usami's grand invitation. I, on behalf of the Chinese press colleagues who have been invited, express my gratitude. The Greater East Asia War has entered a decisive stage. At this time, the actual propaganda war is particularly important. Brother, along with President Guo Yi, came to Shanghai this time to establish the Chinese News Association. The allied embassies and the reporting authorities of the army and navy have given much guidance and cooperation, which is greatly appreciated. The most important issues in propaganda and reporting work are firm will and concentrated strength. If these two conditions can be met, the expected results will be achieved. Brother participated in the News Association Preparatory Committee yesterday and deeply knows that the official and the press can work together with the same heart, the Chinese press can also take unified steps, and the Chinese and Japanese press can also take completely the same will and steps. From this point of view, all the press colleagues related to this News Association can follow the basic principles of unified will and concentrated strength on the central and important issues, and work together hand in hand to fulfill their original intentions. The goal of the propaganda war is to destroy the Anglo-Americans and awaken Chongqing. But in addition to that, we should also pay attention to Shanghai. Shanghai is a place where rumors breed, so we must first strengthen the Shanghai propaganda mechanism in order to achieve propaganda results. Finally, I, on behalf of the Chinese propaganda colleagues, express my gratitude to the allied authorities for their enthusiasm in assisting our country's propaganda cause over the years, and at the same time hope that they will continue to provide double the assistance and guidance in the future in order to achieve propaganda purposes and destroy the Anglo-Americans," and so on. After the speeches, the guests dispersed at about 10:00 PM, all in good spirits.</p>
<h3>The City's Registered Residents' Rice Will Be Universally Sold Within Days. Representatives of All Public Offices Gathered Yesterday for a Meeting.</h3>
<p>The rice for registered residents in this city, which has been suspended for two months, will soon be continuously implemented under the supervision of the city's Goods Allocation Office. The old prices of all the registered residents' rice have been clearly stipulated, and a meeting was held yesterday morning with representatives of all public counties and offices in the city to provide instructions on strengthening the allocation mechanism. The details are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Jinxing Meeting: Rapid Rice Sales</p>
<p>The city's Goods Allocation Office was ordered to continue handling the city's grain distribution based on population. The rice distribution for the first ten days of this month is now actively being discussed. Mr. Feng Jianzhi, the director of the office, presided over the meeting and gave detailed instructions on strengthening the public office mechanism in order to quickly implement rice sales and alleviate the serious threat of popular greed. The meeting did not end until 12:00 noon.</p>
<p>Remaining Rice: Deadline for Registration</p>
<p>After convening a meeting of all public counties and offices yesterday morning, the Goods Allocation Office immediately issued a notice to each public county and office, stating that the city's registered residents' rice will soon begin to be allocated. In order to effectively rectify the situation, starting from the 6th of this month, all public joint offices and rice retailers, etc., operating the free trade of national rice should report the amount of national rice operated truthfully to the office by today (7th), Monday, awaiting verification. If the quantity exceeds 125 piculs, they must first purchase a rice registration form from Room 701 of the office to complete the registration procedures. All rice inventory reports from rice retailers under the jurisdiction of the former First District should be sent to Room 703 of the Goods Allocation Office at 209 Jiangxi Road for verification and receipt. The rice inventory reports from each public county under the jurisdiction of the former Grain Association Bureau should be sent to the Public Grain Section at the old address of the former Grain Association Bureau on Penglai Road in Nanshi for verification and receipt. Each public county office and retailer must not dispose of the stored rice themselves.</p>
<p>Advance Payment by the Mother First, Then Pay the Deposit</p>
<p>In the future, the Goods Allocation Office will allocate rice to each public county in the city due to the rice retailers in each of those counties. Those offices do not need to advance payment first. That is why they should pay the deposit again. It is stipulated that each registered number of rice retailers within the jurisdiction of the former First District must pay a deposit of 10,000 yuan again, which must be submitted to Room 624 of the office today (7th) for verification and receipt. Each public county office under the jurisdiction of the former Grain Bureau must also pay a deposit of 10,000 yuan, which must also be submitted to the accounting office at the old address of the former Grain Bureau today (7th) and must not be delayed.</p>
<p>Registered Residents' Rice Price: Re-investigation</p>
<p>Regarding the universal sale of registered residents' rice in all districts of the city in the first ten days of this month, it is said that the principle is two liters per person. The selling price of registered residents' rice has also been re-adjusted, and it is internally set at 3,500 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates per picul, that is, 35 yuan per catty. The Goods Allocation Office will formally announce this to the public within days.</p>
<h3>The City's Rice Arrival Volume is Extremely Strong</h3>
<p>The city's rice, because the new grains will soon be on the market, farmers in the suburbs are selling old rice, and the arrival volume is extremely strong, the market is flat. Recently, a large batch of rice procured by rice merchants in this city in Wuhu was reduced in price to just over 3,000 yuan per picul. The first batch arrived in port yesterday (6th), totaling 4,875 piculs, which was immediately stored in the designated warehouse of the Zhejiang Xingye Bank. The rest is being shipped one after another and will arrive in Shanghai soon. It is expected that the price of rice in the wood market will continue to fall.</p>
<h3>Agricultural Products Are Continuously Shipped to Shanghai; Last Week's Price Trend Was Stable</h3>
<p>Last week's price trend in this city did not show any significant fluctuations, and most of the prices hovered at the original prices. This was due to the frequent decline in rice prices, the stabilization of people's minds, and the failure of credit to ease in various industries. At the same time, most hoarders felt that the materials they hoarded had been around for a long time, and they were eager to release them at the current market prices, so the availability of spot goods for various materials has obviously increased a lot. Therefore, the market situation of all industries will be stable for a long time, but the economic authorities have not relaxed their thorough investigation work. The reporter learned from various industries yesterday that since the past month, agricultural products from various places have been transported to Shanghai in an endless stream. These items are mostly obtained by various trade control associations through barter. The manufactured goods of this city are first transported to various places to exchange for important agricultural products from the locality, and then these agricultural products are transported to Shanghai by water and land routes for use by various large and small factories as raw materials for goods. Therefore, the city's material raw materials are still abundant.</p>
<h3>The Relationship Between the Thrift Movement and Crime Prevention: Director Li of the Judicial Department Broadcasts a Speech</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Thrift Association is actively promoting the thrift movement and held a regular broadcast. At 7:45 PM yesterday, Li Shiyu, Director of the Judicial Department of the City Police Bureau, gave a broadcast speech on "The Relationship Between the Thrift Movement and Crime Prevention" at the Great Shanghai Radio Station, stating that the thrift movement aims to cultivate a frugal atmosphere among the people, save materials on weekdays, and enhance the country's wartime strength. Standing in the position of the judicial police, I should cooperate to promote this movement, because when we investigate crimes on weekdays, eight or nine out of ten are caused by extravagant enjoyment and improper living, and it can also be said that extravagant consumption is the factor of crime. Therefore, to thoroughly prevent crime and maintain social tranquility, we should eliminate those who only know how to enjoy and do not abide by the law.</p>
<p>Recently, this office, in order to carry out Mayor Chen's will to cooperate in building a great Shanghai, decided to start by clarifying social evils and launched crime prevention work. The objects of our crime prevention are of course the villains, hooligans and corrupt exploiters who generally do not abide by the law, but in order to make this work thorough, we will not easily let go of the wasters who spend their time in improper pleasure. People who lead improper lives are most likely to go astray.</p>
<p>Preliminary Crime Prevention Work</p>
<p>There is a slogan for crime prevention work called "Prevent crime before it happens, safeguard the dignity of the law, promote savings together", and at the same time it points out that "Helping the authorities to prevent crime is to protect your own safety". This sentence says it even more clearly. It turns out that everyone should cooperate in the development of crime prevention work and study it together. I think that the thrift movement is a cooperative crime prevention movement, but relying on empty talk is useless, so I think that if citizens can practice thrift, they have done the preliminary crime prevention work. On the one hand, we hope that citizens will report to the authorities the illegal merchants in Shanghai who disregard the law and only exploit the people for their own enjoyment, so that they can be punished by law and never be seen again. At the same time, the crime prevention section has implemented surveillance and crackdown on all entertainment venues that are gold mines, so that everyone is thrifty and everyone abides by the law. In that case, people can cultivate their own thrift and cooperate with us to complete the purpose of eliminating bad people and reducing crime. But I think that any movement should be promoted with the three forces of guidance, control, and remediation in order to achieve results. It is not enough to just promote empty talk. I hope that all of you dear citizens will earnestly practice thrift and work hard to prevent crime.</p>
<p>Reader Assistance Message</p>
<h3>Happiness Is Entrusted to Studies: Cannot Become an Adult After Dropping Out of School. A Student's Anxious Emotions</h3>
<p>Yesterday, we issued a call, asking all readers to make their final contribution to help more than 3,000 out-of-school youths. Because in this year's application to help 7,000 students, in addition to university seniors, more than 6,000 students have already participated in the written examination procedures organized by this newspaper, and most of them have excellent grades, and they should be subsidized. Unfortunately, the amount of donations now can only subsidize 3,000 students, and the remaining half will inevitably be unable to help. After this news was published, we received letters from two applying students that night, expressing anxiety and deep fear of dropping out of school without getting a grant. One passage in particular made us feel very touched. He said: "...I am sixteen years old this year. My father died of depression this spring because he lost his job, leaving behind an old mother and four brothers and sisters. The eldest brother is disabled, and the sister is young. The old mother left home with tears to prepare for others. I read the newspaper in the morning and do housework at night. I will study in high school next semester. If I do not get the grant from your newspaper, I will inevitably drop out of school, but I feel that my lifelong happiness is completely entrusted to my studies. If I drop out of school, it will prove that I am not as good as others, a mediocre person, and my future is bleak, and I will not be able to become an adult in the future, and it is better to die than to live. I have no choice but to ask first whether I can be included in the approved assistance list..." In addition to replying to the letter to comfort and correct his hasty ideas, I deeply feel that there are many students seeking help in this kind of loop. Especially among the more than 3,000 students who have not been able to get subsidies, most of them are clean and excellent, and everyone has a heart of compassion. How can they bear to order them to drop out of school? Moreover, helping students is to cultivate talents and plant trees, and its contribution to the country and society has a positive significance, which is different from the usual passive benefit. I believe that there is no lack of enthusiastic people in the society, especially the wealthy and rich, who hope to donate generously, the more the better.</p>
