<p>社評</p>
<h3>同時禁絕外國式賭博</h3>
<p>十八日市宣傳處舉行記者例會時，市府秘書處答覆關於本市賭塲三月底禁絕的質問，謂：「外傳延期禁絕之說，均屬不確，本府旣已限令各賭塲於三月二十九日停閉，決一不延期。」賭博為害之烈，不待闡釋，已人盡皆知。市府決心禁絕賭博，當然是値得稱頌的一件德政。</p>
<p>賭博之所以為害，在於誘人迷惑，墮落意志，傾家蕩產。賭博的方式雖有不同，而足以害人的性質則無一致。因此，旣巳禁賭，則凡是具有毒害性質的賭博，必須一律禁絕。絕對不應區別其方式而有所不同，網開一面。如果說同樣具有毒害性質的賭博，因為方式不同，就可一面禁絕，一面存在，這是絕不公道，絕不澈底的辦法。如果說中國方式的賭博，是有毒害性質而加以禁絕，外國方式的賭博，就沒有毒害性質而可以存在，這是自相矛盾何等畸形的現象。譬如，南市賭塲的搖攤牌九是中國式賭博，應該禁絕。而第一區內的回力球。跑狗跑馬是外國式賭博，就不必禁止。無論從任何方面推諉，畢竟是極不合理，不足取信於人民的。我們擁護市府禁絕南市賭塲，我們更擁護凡寓賭博性質的賭塲，不論何區，不論方式，市府應一律禁絕，以免由此竄彼，重害市民。</p>
<p>或有人說，外國式賭塲的存在，可以補助市政經費，否則影響財政。但我們要問。。</p>
<p>市府每月得到若干？</p>
<p>賭塲股東每月得到若干？個人所得，是否比市府更多。是否以補助政府經費為藉口，為掩護，而遂其個人的慾望？</p>
<p>因賭博存在而引誘市民墮落，傾家蕩產者，每天有多少？每月有多少？所謂補助市府經費的所入，與引誘市民墮落傾家蕩產的損失，兩相權衡，在市府與市民整個關係上是否得當？是否應該？孰輕孰重？孰利孰弊？</p>
<p>盟邦日本最近決定停止高級娛樂，在此決戰階段，時局嚴重之際，盟邦為貫澈決戰精神，雖正當娛樂亦決然停閉。而我們同樣是參戰國家，參戰都市，應否有此賭博性質的塲所存在的必要？</p>
<p>從任何觀點立論，外國式賭博，絕對應與中國式賭博同時禁絕。况且，　府財政，應着眼於整頓各項稅收，正常的開源方汪。而不應着眼於含有毒響大衆性質的賭博，不正當的方法。</p>
<p>至於賭塲工作人員，雖因賭博禁絕，一方面政府或社會人士應負責指導，生產事業的工作。此外，南市各赌塲禁絕以後，所這房屋均頗實敞，可以移　與學校使用，自然更有積極的憲義。</p>
<p>最後，希望社會福利部設計較有意義的簡　娛　辦法，必須大衆化，惠而不費，適應環境。在此重要的决戰年，後方重要基地的上海，娛樂應該絕對簡單經濟，以適合大衆化的原則。</p>

<h3>列國統帥陣容一瞥</h3>
<p>就貫通物質與精神兩方而，結集國家總力於完遂戰爭的一點上，統帥和國務的緊密化，乃是絕對必要的事。世界的戰局一天天地激烈化，各主要交戰國節進一步　向這個階段，　兩者成為一元化，已盛為最近　著的一般頃向。所以各國向來所採取獨立性的「純粹作戰，」已不復存在。近代戰爭的總力戰行政措施必須與作戰相呼應，同時作戰必須物質和精神一致，使國家總力迅速推移，而畫其確立養備態勢的最大任務，　應這種需要的，自盟邦德國始，乃至蘇聯及敵國英美等，也相繼效尤。就向來的軍事機關，國務機關作戰上，統一國務，設立新機構，或由元首首相大總統等任最高指揮官，媾通統帥，軍政與國務三者，確立一元的戰爭指導體系，而將從來的軍政，軍令機關實於其下，各分担軍務。茲將各國統帥組織路述於後：</p>
<p>日本在狂　怒濤的太平洋繼續搏鬥的日美兩軍，已突入最後的决戰階段了。當此戰局愈　　大之時，日木陸海軍為更一層使統帥及政務緊密化並為發揚全睦海軍最高度總力起見，東條陸軍大將兼任參謀總長，島田海軍大將兼任軍令部總長，實各劃期的英斷。政戰兩略的密切化，為退行戰學之最大要　，更毋庸　言。由此適應苛烈的　局，完備融通無礙的强力陣容，對於作戰的指導與士氣的昻揚，貢獻極大，可謂日本陸海軍確立磐石的體制。茲將　海軍軍令部的沿革誌在下面</p>
<p>參謀本部</p>
<p>參謀本部最初不是獨立的機關，於明治六年三月始設於陸軍省內，稱為第六局。七年二月撤廢第六局，改稱參謀局，局長由陸軍鄉陸軍中將山縣有明兼任。第二任局長為鳥尾小　太。明治十一年十二月獨立為參謀本部，第一任參謀本部長為山縣，第二任由陸軍辦陸軍中將大山　，內務　　縣兼千，繼由陸軍大將有栖川宮熾仁親王就任。二十一年五月十四日參謀本部條例改訂，部內分設陸軍參謀本部及海軍參謀本部，前之本部長改稱參軍，由陸軍中將小澤武雄任參軍。明治二十二年三明九日參謀本部改為陸軍德軍令機關，以現在制度同，即與海軍參謀本部分離，於是稱為參謀總長。第一，任參謀總長為熾仁親王，次即以川上操六中將，大山元帥，山縣元帥，兒玉源太郎大將，奧保鞏元師，長谷川好道元帥，上原勇作元帥，河合操，鈴木莊六，命谷範三各大將為次序，任參謀縱長·昭和六年十二月滿洲事變發生時，　院宮載仁親王殿下就任參謀總長，昭和十五年十月杉山大將　任，以至今日。這中問總長都為專任制。</p>
<p>軍令部</p>
<p>海軍軍令機關最初獨立是在明治十九年三月參謀本部條例改訂的時候，二中一年五月參謀本部條例撤　，改為參軍官制，但海軍軍令機關於　他軍政機關分離獨立的根本方針，絲毫沒有變更，參軍之下有陸軍參謀本部長，海軍參謀本部長併立輔佐參軍，而管掌陸海軍的部務，迨至二十三年三月大改訂，陸海軍即赫然分離，分為參謀本部及海軍參謀部，同時一旦獨立的軍令機關再在海軍大臣管轄之下，海軍軍令機關，從軍令軍政的二元組織，復歸於一元組織，於是海軍大臣在軍政方面與陸軍大臣立在同列之位，而在軍令方而則與參謀總長在同等位置。後來因海軍兵力有飛躍的增大，痛　軍令機構有獨立之必要，遂於二十六年五月十九日制定海軍軍令部條例，海軍參謀部改為海軍軍令部而獨立，不屬海軍大臣　　，成為獨立的軍令機關。然後海軍軍令部條例　次改訂追捕，但其組織大綱殆無變更。迨至昭和八年九月二十七日撤退　海軍軍令部條例，制定現行「軍令部令」，即將海軍軍令部改　軍令部，而海軍軍令部長改稱軍令部總長，於是海軍軍令機構名符其實地確立。第一任軍令部總長為伏見宮博恭王殿下，第二任於十六年四月由永野修身大將繼任。回顧歷任軍令部長　軍令部總長如下：中半田倉之助中將。梯山資紀大將，伊東祐亨元帥，東鄕平八郎元帥，伊集院五郎元帥，島村速雄元帥，山下源太郎大將，鈴木貫太郎大將，加薩寬治大將，谷口尚偵大將，伏見宮博恭王殿下，永野修身大將，以上十二人。現在戰局進入决戰時期，軍令軍政高度之繁密化極為重要，因此島田大將即兼任軍令部總長。然而參謀本部或軍令部均與陸軍省或海軍省併立，在機構上軍政軍令並肩獨立，其上層則圖謀軍令，軍政之緊密化。將發揮高度的政戰兩略的一致力量。</p>
<p>德國</p>
<p>德國政府於一九三八年二月四日，發表「關於國防軍統帥的總統佈告一，使國防軍的指揮系統　純化。根據此項布告，陸海空三軍的總指揮權，由希特勒元首一手掌握，從來成為國防軍總司令部輔助機關的國防局，昇格為過防軍司令部國防軍最高指揮官成為希特勒元首的僚屬，撤廢其他一切中間機關，元會直屬下設海陸空三軍長官。這種國防軍指揮系統的改革，不但促成校帥權的一元化，而且　從來連絡欠圓滑的黨與國家的人的構成上，也親密起來，以期兵力發動的萬全，這在政治上，自然具有重大意味。依據此一改革，希特勒元首，身兼黨魁，總理和國防軍最高指揮官，集黨，國，軍的命令於一身。一九四一年底以來，兼任陸軍總司令部，其下由基德爾元帥任國防軍總監兼大本營幕僚長輔佐最高司令官，空軍總司令官是戈林元帥，海軍總司令是竇尼茲元帥，各各分掌軍務。（未完）（弘。譯自二月二十三日每日新聞）</p>

<h3>德機大編隊　猛炸赫爾港　美機再襲德南部</h3>
<p>柏林二十日中央社電德國新聞社訊，據此間櫃成方面宣稱：强大之德轟炸機大編隊，復於今最二時前飛越海峽。以便大舉襲攻英本土，當時突氣淸朗，故視綫極佳。</p>
<p>又訊，昨午夜前一時德轟炸機大編隊對英東岸赫爾港Holl施行集中轟炸。據目下所得而知者，其結果或可稱極為滿意，最後離開目標地之德機曾見赫爾城及港中均發生大火多起，尤以船塢區焚燒</p>
<p>柏林二十日中央社電　德軍當局發表：美轟炸機及長距離戰鬥機隊，十九日白賽越阿爾車山脈來襲德國南部，德機當即起飛迎擊，展開熾烈空戰，擊落其四引擎轟炸機二十架戰鬥機多架。</p>
<p>柏林二十日中央社電　德元首行營十九日發表：英美空軍於過去二十四小時內空襲德本土及議北部德軍基地時，曾受重創，計共喪失九十三架，內四引擊機十三架。敵空軍於畫間曾轟炸慕尼黑及夫利德利赫斯哈券。又十八日夜再度空襲法蘭克福，致受有損害及死傷者，又少數英機會對德中部及北部，作攪亂襲擎。</p>
<h3>伊朗新內閣　着手組織中</h3>
<p>安加拉二十日中央社電據德黑　消息：薩特海已奉命組織伊朗新內　，渠曾入圈多大。</p>
<h3>西歐風雲漸緊　德積極增強防務</h3>
<p>柏林二十日中央社電東綫南部蘇軍仍沿勒姆　至奧迪薩之鐵路進攻，兩市之運絡已有一部被切斷，就目下情形而觀，蘇聯並無緩和攻勢之意，大有乘勢一舉進攻羅馬尼亞之勢。然德軍亦必忍受一切犧牲，於此後防綫上竭力阻止蘇軍，衆認德軍將在該方面動員相當數目之預備軍，且現在已予動員中。據此間軍事專家觀察：今後當蘇軍在該方面壓力增大時，德國為防備英美軍在西歐開關戰機，必將抽出一部兵方防禦西歐，時即英美在西歐登陸之時機。最近英美空軍轟炸德國，並未收獲可觀效果，故英美今後或將集中主力，轟炸德國各，工業都市，俾於英美軍登陸以前徹底摧毀德國空軍然第二戰綫開　之時機、現似迫切。又英美空軍一再企圖轟炸柏林，覺於白畫以多數長距離戰鬥機，與德戰鬥機展開大空戰，欲消耗德國戰鬥機，故當英美在西歐登陸之際，德國空軍威力或略為減少，現傳英美大軍，巳集結於已普爾及英國南部各海岸。總之西歐海岸風雲漸吿緊張。</p>
<h3>義境反軸心軍　計劃失敗　德堅守卡西諾</h3>
<p>柏林二十日中央社電　德軍當局發表：反軸心軍於納吐諾及安齊奧橋顯堡之作戰，已費時六十日，共喪失兵員一萬五千，艦船五十萬噸，反軸心軍對納吐諾實行之側面攻擊上陸戰，始自去年九月九日之　萊爾莫及十月十四日之特爾摩里上陸戰，其目的之一，在於急速突破卡西諾戰錢，並包圍該地德軍。另一目的即在以雷擊作戰攻陷羅馬，然劉歸於失敗</p>
<p>柏林二十日中央社電　德元首行營十九日戰報稱：反軸心軍於戰車支援下，纔續猛攻卡西諾，德軍在空軍協力下，經激戰後已將其擊退，他方德軍更行勇猛反擊，已奪回卡西諾市西北部化成廢墟之城廓。</p>
<h3>羅馬尼亞　採緊急措施　捍衛國土具絕大決心</h3>
<p>沮里克二十日中央社電、東綫南部蘇軍之攻劣，已漸迫近羅馬尼亞國境。據羅京消息，羅軍巳在聶斯特河沿岸構築陣地，準備邀擊。另息，羅國各地駐軍，紛紛開往貝薩拉比亞增援。叉羅國中央銀行，亦由提拉斯波爾他遷，奧迪薩港所泊羅國船舶，已奉命立即出港。</p>
<p>柏林二十日中央社電據羅京來電：東綫南部戰事漸次接近羅馬尼亞國境，目下正在該國境前　展開激戰，此對羅馬尼亞國民頗有大影響，羅京市民為防衛國土，决澈底抵抗</p>

<h3>羅邱會唔認為可能</h3>
<p>瑞典京城廿日中央社電據海通社訊：瑞典報紙稱：英政界人士指陳美京方面謠傳羅斯福邱吉爾將再度會晤，雖未得官方證實，但實屬可能。如羅邱再度會晤，其目的當不在討論英美之戰事目標，英國在目前顯然不顧討諭此項問題。英左派人士抨擊不遵守大西洋憲章者日衆，力主英外交政策應予明白說明。倫教政界人土認為英左派份子無保守黨之傳統經騐，不知實力政策之意義，致忘却對大西洋憲章之種種聲明，僅為適應目前之一般戰局而發。瑞典報紙又稱，羅斯福亦希望在下屆總統峯　前，反軸心之外交政策得明朗化。倫敦觀察家認為羅邱晤面時，凡經美國務副卿斯蒂丁尼斯所發動之協定可望批准。</p>
<h3>羅嚴辭抨擊　美和平勸吿</h3>
<p>羅京一十日中央社　　美國勸吿羅馬尼亞採納反軸心和平條件之呼籲，此間「潮流報」斷然加以拒絕，該報引紐約時報」紙評論謂「英美蘇三國發表關於巴爾幹政局之聯合聲明之時機，似已成熟」，而加以指斥稱，無人要求反軸心方面此項聲明，若美國欲悉歐洲人之感想如何，當知仇蘇之念籠蔽一切戰事問題。</p>

<h3>閑話時局</h3>
<p>— 德富蘇峰</p>
<p>我决不是聳言慄聽，而此次戰爭，可以說是空前絕後的，是織續神武東征奠定國基以來的一大聖戰。我相信，以神武天皇的御駕東征，和今日的大東亞聖戰相對照，是最為恰當的。日本歷史上的一切戰爭，雖然各有其意義，但東征是統一日本大人洲的戰爭，大東亞戰爭是統一全世界大入洲的戰爭。神武東征是前提，而此次大東亞戰爭，則為結論。站在歷史眼光上看，這兩次大戰，是有其血脈相通，息息相關的。</p>
<p>我們必須要瞭解聖戰之所以為聖戰的道理。我們决不是為搶奪煤油而戰。也决不是為搶奪樹膠而戰。也不是為搶奪鐵與錫而戰。我們是為了保護世界而戰，為了產除致世界於未刦不復的惡魔而戰。所謂世界上的惡魔也者，當然就是英美囉！如果仔細一考察他們的行為，則任何惡魔也不能出其右。他們國民之中的一個人，密爾頓在「失掉了的樂園」一書中所描寫的　麗，如和今日的邱吉爾羅斯福輩比較起來，即日者尚稍有堂堂的男子氣，尚稍有惡魔首領的派頭，然而今日惡魔幽的頭子們，却實在不値得密爾頓大筆一揮的資料。他們除了被稱作扒　和毛賊的老頭子外，實無其他更恰當的讚詞來恭維他們。</p>
<p>假如從數量上說，，朝蒙古的大軍和我們日本的防衝將士之數目，實在有天壞之別。但當時我們日本的國策是統一的，一　的。任何一個窮鄉僻壤的角落裏，都充滿着氣吞山河，致對外，殺敵致果的雄心。甚至有人主張，與其在玄海洋上防禦，倒莫如進而反攻大陸。橫跨歐亞菲三大洲的家古大帝國，所以不能施展武尤於日本者，就是我們日本同仇敵愾心之磅講蓬勃所致。他們雖然常想征服日本，但他們認為日本人非常勇敢，不能征服，於是便放棄了派兵來征的野心。他們得不償失的算盤，終於吿訴他們斷念於派兵侵略，換當之，他們認為侵犯日本將付極大的代價，至於所得是否有把握，尚在不可知之數，這就是他們　不償失的觀念。就是後來到了明朝，也以不出兵日本為　。這是元朝給他們遣留下的實際敎訓，而覺悟到侵犯日本為一蠢事。所以自始至終就不敢存覬覦之心。所以說，戰勝的最好秘訣，九十以同仇敵愾心來粉碎敵人的企圖，使敵人深知道不能制勝，造成敵人的絕望心理，這就是最上策。這樣澈底的制服敵人，最主要者就是忍耐。一般人都常說。勝利在於最後五分鐘，即指此而言。正如兩個兒童在河裏站着打水仗一樣。按現是始終不會有勝負的。只是一方忍受不住悶氣而自認輸，另一方則能忍耐，於是才能分出勝負來，所以勝利的一大要素，只有忍耐。</p>
<p>然而對於忍耐，食　是必要的。肚皮　了，而仍然說不餓，這種忍耐只能限於一時，而不能持久，所以在任何時候，餓肚皮是不能忍耐的，　肚皮雖然也是忍耐中的一種，然而為了更大的忍耐，則餓肚皮之類的忍耐，應當不必有。食糧以外還有軍需品和人力資源。拿最眼前的　情來講，就是多多製造精良的飛機，多多養成熟練而勇敢的飛行員。今日我們日本政府當局，用盡所有齣力量向這一方面突飛猛進，自然也是應該的事。無論如何，當前的主要課題，就是孔子所說的食足足兵。孔子還曾說過：「食足，兵足，民始信之」。這個「信」字，是其中最要緊的。所謂「信」，就是必勝信念。然而必勝信念，是由領會我們聖戰的目的而來者。我們今日是替天行道，擔負著徐人類六敵的神聖任務。必須完整這一任務，就是既定的方針。我們毫無懷疑我們取得勝利的餘隙。我們應當善自覺悟地把握到這一任務，而必須完成這一任務。如是，所謂最後的勝利，才必定屬於我們的，（完）（魯譯自二月十一日每日新聞）</p>
<h3>開發西亞油田英美利益衝突</h3>
<p>美政府的開發阿拉伯油田地帶計劃，在美國議會中頗滋議論。攻擊政府的念先鋒民主黨參議員　阿氏，要求解散在獲得阿拉伯油田利權中活躍的美國石油貯藏公司、舊孤立派一黨也責難羅斯福不努力拉撤邱吉爾。</p>
<p>因巴倫島的石油利權問題而引起英美間衝突的也是最近的事情。美國在開發阿拉伯油田中擬投資的金額大概為四億一千美元（內一億一千元為輸油管，一建設工廠），木計劃據傳已由戰時燃料調整局長官兼石油貯藏公司總裁伊克斯與英國的海外石油配給委員會商訂協定，蘇聯尚未接談，但蘇聯亦要求獲得波斯灣的輸油港。</p>
<h3>國內的反對聲</h3>
<p>又美國的開發西亞石油資源，與該方面的英國右油利權衝突，發展為困難的外交問題。國內亦有强硬的反對論，負責者戰時燃料長官伊克斯的立塲，頗為困難。前美孚石油公司副經理詹姆斯墨飛對上述政府計觀亦展開猛烈的反對運動，追究伊克斯的責任，而要求其辭職。按完成該計劃，至少需二十萬萬美元的巨額經費，並需使用鋼鐵五十萬噸，但結果呢英國本國合克撒州和紐約州間的石油連費每斛僅需一角一分錢，而新計劃中，阿刺伯到埃及間的運費，每解却需二角四分之多，還加上百分之十五的中途運油損失，從經濟上看，實在是不智之極。（翔：）譯自三月六日東京朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>松平情報部長　發表訪蘇感想　中日人民表現合作精神</h3>
<p>中日人民表現合作精神</p>
<p>日駐華大使館上海事務所松平情報部長，於十七日因公赴蘇，已於十九日公畢返滬，茲發表此次　蘇視察之印蒙，略謂；蘇州為淸鄕發源地，徑淸鄕二年後之蘇州。其一切建設必較其他各地更有進步，故有此行。抵蘇曾訪問省府當局，及參觀工廠等等，象極佳。其一如參觀蘇綸紗廠，該廠前為軍管理，現巳交還原主嚴慶祥，該廠雖感原料燃料不足，仍努力增產，其生產品係供給常地中日雙方，該廠對中日實業界之合作，著力頗甚，其二為不蘇省政府之努力溝通中日文化工作，設立省立日語學校，已於二月二十日開學，學生三十餘人，該校不僅敎授日語並設政治經濟文化等課目，省府內另建一日本式房屋，俾人民得悉日本之風俗習慣，作為中日文化貫通之工具，用意深遠。此均為完遂大東亞戰爭申之中日互相協助表現。他如當地日本軍民對中國之協助，最近有同文書院敎授五人在無錫江陰一帶協助淸鄕工作。旅蘇日本僑民當永先生，為蘇州建築材料公司之總經理，對中國農民作　種協助，其夫人對濟貧施診等。尤上熱心，故頗得農民之敬重樂拜。父有”本佛　，　　，一面傳揚敎、作中日文化貫通工作，一方面救助中國難民。並設立日本語學校等等。亦頗　蘇地人民信仰。其他中日人民努力於協力工作者，其例甚冬，足見中日人民趨於密切之合作。</p>
<h3>分析歐洲最近形勢</h3>

<p>英美蘇三國在德黑　會戰時，對歐洲政策，表而上雖為一致，惟於會議終了後，就最近歐洲情勢分析，顯見三國意　紛歧，磨擦日甚、學例如下：　英國為妥協蘇聯，不惜　　波　，同意蘇聯合併波蘭之大部領土，波蘭雖要求　國帮助，但美感左右為　，乃數　了事　南斯拉夫境內，遊擊陰分二派，有英國援助之　擊隊，及　聯援助之遊擊　，蘇要求英停止援助，英國卒　步，自動放棄援助米哈羅伊　游擊隊，而向蘇　　服。　英美對建立猶太國問題意見不一致，美國主張在巴勒斯坦建立猶太國，而英則對汎阿拉伯派表示同情。　英美對波斯國煤油開發權之爭奪，兩國均企圖覇佔。　蘇聯突然承認義大利巴特里奧政權，事前幷未通知英美，美國對此表示不滿，美國務卿赫爾曾發表談話。拒絕承認。　土耳其之不願加入反軸心，土深知與英聯合面參戰，土必首當其衛，英蘇勢力之衝突，必　土國發生戰學而更露骨，故極力維持中立。　地中海近東北部蘇聯外交官活動甚力，已引起英國之戒心，最近南非洲聯盟有馬朋博士，於三月十六日竟發表反蘇談話稱：將來如反軸心軍勝利，勢必為共產勢力之蔓延，故為預防共　勢力，宜協助德國擊敗蘇聯。總之現歐洲情勢甚為複雜，英美蘇三國意見更形紛歧，均足使反軸心國助途之難於樂觀。</p>

<h3>總崛起運動</h3>
<p>日本政府為傾全力增强生產計，業於上月二十五日閣議中决守决戰非當指價耍綱，迄今已有停止高級享樂具體要　等十二件之公佈與實施，同時與此並行者，則有國民總崛起運動，其主要目標，即為增强生產，日本的國民總崛起運動，截至目前為止，包括　限制旅客運輸，目的在於以增强戰力與防空疏散人口為重點，　强化女子挺身　制度，目的在於使獨身女子協力動勞工作。　實行勸勞昻揚方策。目的在於念速提高工業廠之勤勞能率。以上三個實施要綱之中，兩個固均純粹以增强生產為主。</p>

<h3>強制收買糧的改善</h3>
<p>— 宋慶祥</p>
<p>自米統會成立迄今，其配給之教量會節，未能使市民滿意。老其原因，雖由於統制機構之不健全，人事之不統一，日價格絞之黑市米價相差太大，易使辦事人員見利生弊，而最重大者莫若於收買地區，不顧農家血本，而强制抑價收買，使當地農戶皆視收買為長途，所有米栗或以釀造酒食，或以改造別　物質，以避免當局之收買，甚或有以種米麥之地區改種別種免遭收買之農作物，以圖厚利，似此種植，難以盡述，若强制收買之法，長此而不求改善，將來非但食米配給之數量增加無　，甚或米糧之恐慌，將日甚一日，眼看黑市米價，更加昂貴，糧食之問題不堪設想矣。</p>
<p>鄙人以為一公益事、之興創，其當地　關當局，當予以相當之　助，而交通運輸之機關亦然，若米統會往產米地區出以當地之市價，向農戶收買　食後，相商於各運輸之機關，盡量減低運費，運　後，依照收買之原價，足量配給全市民，以應日常之需求，若以則被收買區之農戶既有相當勞力之利潤，不致虧損血本，必顧將所有之農作物盡量供獻與收買機關，而海上市民，以比目前稍高之價格購得足量之配給食糧，而免仰頗於黑市，市民無須購買黑市昂貴之食糧，則黑市自然消滅，墨市滅跡，米統會乃能以其順利收得之足量米糧而施行其統一配給之責任也·甚望親政當局注意及之。</p>

<h3>Simultaneously Forbidding Foreign-Style Gambling</h3>
<p>During the press conference held by the City Propaganda Department on the 18th, the City Government Secretariat, in response to questions about the banning of gambling dens in the city by the end of March, stated: "Rumors of postponing the ban are all untrue. The government has already ordered all gambling dens to close by March 29th, and there will be no postponement." The severity of the harm caused by gambling is self-evident and known to all. The city government's determination to ban gambling is, of course, a commendable act of good governance.</p>
<p>The harm of gambling lies in its ability to lure and deceive people, erode their will, and lead to financial ruin. While the methods of gambling may vary, their ability to cause harm remains consistent. Therefore, since gambling has been banned, all forms of gambling with harmful characteristics must be completely prohibited. There should be absolutely no distinction made based on the method, creating loopholes. To say that gambling with the same harmful characteristics can be banned on one hand and allowed to exist on the other simply because the method differs is absolutely unfair and incomplete. If Chinese-style gambling is banned because it is harmful, while foreign-style gambling is allowed to exist because it is not, this is a self-contradictory and absurd phenomenon. For example, the "shaking stall" pai gow in the Nanshi gambling dens is a Chinese-style form of gambling and should be banned. However, the jai alai, dog racing, and horse racing in the first district are foreign-style gambling and need not be prohibited. Regardless of any excuses, this is ultimately unreasonable and will not gain the trust of the people. We support the city government's ban on the Nanshi gambling dens, and we further support the city government's complete ban on all gambling dens with gambling characteristics, regardless of the district or method, to prevent them from moving elsewhere and harming the citizens again.</p>
<p>Some might say that the existence of foreign-style gambling dens can subsidize municipal finances; otherwise, finances would be affected. But we must ask:</p>
<p>How much does the city government receive each month?</p>
<p>How much do the shareholders of the gambling dens receive each month? Is their personal income greater than that of the city government? Is the subsidization of government finances being used as an excuse to conceal and fulfill personal desires?</p>
<p>How many citizens are lured into depravity and financial ruin each day and each month because of the existence of gambling? When weighing the income from subsidizing municipal finances against the loss from luring citizens into depravity and financial ruin, is it appropriate and justifiable in the overall relationship between the city government and the citizens? What is more important? What are the advantages and disadvantages?</p>
<p>Our ally Japan recently decided to cease high-end entertainment. During this decisive battle phase and at this critical juncture, our ally, in order to implement the spirit of the decisive battle, resolutely closed even legitimate entertainment venues. And we, as a participating country and a participating city, should there be any need for the existence of these gambling venues?</p>
<p>From any perspective, foreign-style gambling should absolutely be banned simultaneously with Chinese-style gambling. Furthermore, the city government's finances should focus on streamlining various tax revenues and legitimate sources of income, rather than on gambling with harmful effects on the public and illegitimate methods.</p>
<p>As for the gambling den workers, although they will be affected by the ban on gambling, the government or social organizations should be responsible for guiding them towards productive work. In addition, after the Nanshi gambling dens are closed, the buildings, which are quite spacious, can be transferred to schools for use, which would naturally have a more positive meaning.</p>
<p>Finally, it is hoped that the Ministry of Social Welfare will design more meaningful and simple entertainment methods that are accessible to the masses, affordable, and adapted to the environment. In this important year of the decisive battle, in Shanghai, a crucial rear base, entertainment should be absolutely simple and economical, in line with the principle of being accessible to the masses.</p>

District inspectors will conduct inspections, guide farmers in improving agricultural tools, and compile reports.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Command Structure of Various Nations</h3>
<p>In order to concentrate the overall national strength to complete the war, by integrating both material and spiritual aspects, the close coordination between command and state affairs is absolutely necessary. As the world's war situation intensifies day by day, the major belligerent countries are moving further into this stage. The unification of the two has become a general trend. Therefore, the "pure operation" of independent nature formerly adopted by various countries no longer exists. The administrative measures of modern war's total war must correspond to operations, and operations must be materially and spiritually consistent, so that the national strength moves quickly. The greatest task to establish and prepare for is responding to this need, starting with our ally Germany, to the Soviet Union, and our enemy countries, like England and the US have also followed suit. Regarding the existing military and national affairs organizations, unification of national affairs, the establishment of new institutions, or the appointment of heads of state and prime ministers and presidents as supreme commanders, to coordinate the command, military affairs, and national affairs into a unified war guidance system. The traditional military and command organs are under these to take on their respective military duties. The command structures of the various countries are described below:</p>
<p>Japan</p>
<p>The Japanese and American armies, fiercely fighting in the raging Pacific, have entered the final decisive stage. As the war becomes increasingly important, in order to further tighten the coordination between command and political affairs and to develop the highest total strength of the overall military, the concurrent appointments of General Tojo of the Army as Chief of the General Staff and Admiral Shimada of the Navy as Chief of the Naval General Staff were indeed epoch-making. The close integration of political and military strategies is the greatest essential of advancing war studies, needless to say. From this, in order to adapt to the harsh situation and to have a complete and unimpeded powerful formation, there is an extremely large contribution to operational guidance and morale, and it can be said that the Japanese land and naval forces have established a bedrock system. The history of the naval command is recorded below:</p>
<p>General Staff Headquarters</p>
<p>The General Staff Headquarters was not originally an independent organization. It was first established within the Ministry of the Army in March of the sixth year of Meiji and was called the Sixth Bureau. In February of the seventh year, the Sixth Bureau was abolished and renamed the Staff Bureau. The director of the bureau was concurrently held by Lieutenant General Yamagata Aritomo of the Army. The second director of the bureau was Tori O Koetai. In December of the 11th year of Meiji, it became independent as the General Staff Headquarters. The first chief of the General Staff Headquarters was Yamagata. The second was Lieutenant General Oyama of the Army, followed by Lieutenant General Oyama concurrently serving. Then Prince Arisugawa Taruhito became appointed. On May 14th of the 21st year of Meiji, the regulations of the General Staff Headquarters were revised, and the Army General Staff Headquarters and Navy General Staff Headquarters were established within the department. The former chief of staff was renamed Military Officer, and Lieutenant General Ozawa Takeo was appointed as Military Officer. On March 9th of the 22nd year of Meiji, the General Staff Headquarters was changed to the Army's military command organ, the same as the current system, that is, separated from the Naval Staff Headquarters, and was thus called the Chief of the General Staff. The first Chief of the General Staff was Prince Taruhito, followed by Lieutenant General Kawakami Soroku, Marshal Oyama, Marshal Yamagata, General Kodama Gentaro, Marshal Okubo Yasukata, Marshal Hasegawa Yoshimichi, Marshal Uehara Yusaku, Kawai Osamu, Suzuki Soichi, and General Hata Hanzaku in that order were appointed Chief of the General Staff. When the Manchurian Incident occurred in December of the 6th year of Showa, Prince Kan'in Kotohito was appointed Chief of the General Staff. In October of the 15th year of Showa, General Sugiyama was appointed, until today. The Chiefs of Staff were full-time.</p>
<p>Naval Command</p>
<p>The Naval Command was initially independent when the regulations of the General Staff Headquarters were revised in March of the 19th year of Meiji. In May of the 21st year, the regulations of the General Staff Headquarters were revoked and changed to a military officer system. However, the fundamental policy of the Naval Command to separate and be independent from other military affairs organs did not change in the slightest. Under the military officer, there were the Chief of the Army General Staff Headquarters and the Chief of the Navy General Staff Headquarters, who assisted the military officer and managed the affairs of the army and navy. By the major revision in March of the 23rd year, the army and navy were distinctly separated, divided into the General Staff Headquarters and the Naval Staff Headquarters. At the same time, once an independent military command organ was again under the jurisdiction of the Minister of the Navy. The naval military command organ, from the dual organization of military command and military administration, returned to a unified organization. Thus, the Minister of the Navy was on the same level as the Minister of the Army in terms of military administration, and in terms of military command, he was on the same level as the Chief of the General Staff. Later, because the naval forces had increased dramatically, and it was believed that the military command structure needed to be independent, the Naval Command Ordinance was enacted on May 19th of the 26th year, and the Naval Staff Headquarters was changed to the Naval Command and became independent, not belonging to the Minister of the Navy, becoming an independent military command organ. Then the Naval Command Ordinance was revised several times, but the outline of its organization remained largely unchanged. Until September 27th of the 8th year of Showa, the Naval Command Ordinance was revoked, and the current "Military Command Ordinance" was enacted, that is, the Naval Command was changed to the Military Command, and the Chief of the Naval Command was changed to the Chief of the Military Command, and the Naval Command mechanism was established in name and in fact. The first Chief of the Military Command was Prince Fushimi Hiroyasu, the second was Admiral Nagano Osami in the 16th year. Looking back at the Chiefs of the Naval Command and the Chiefs of the Military Command as follows: Vice Admiral Handa Kuranosuke, Admiral Hatayama Sukeki, Marshal Ito Sukeyuki, Marshal Togo Heihachiro, Marshal Ijuin Goro, Marshal Shimamura Hayao, Admiral Yamashita Gentaro, Admiral Suzuki Kantaro, Admiral Kasa Kanji, Admiral Taniguchi Naosumi, Prince Fushimi Hiroyasu, Admiral Nagano Osami. Now that the war has entered the decisive stage, the high density of military command and military administration is extremely important. Therefore, Admiral Shimada concurrently serves as the Chief of the Military Command. However, the General Staff Headquarters or the Military Command are both parallel with the Ministry of the Army or the Ministry of the Navy. Structurally, military administration and military command stand independently side by side, and the upper level seeks to tighten military command and military administration. We will exert the unified strength of highly political and strategic integration.</p>
<p>Germany</p>
<p>On February 4, 1938, the German government issued the "Presidential Decree on the Command of the National Defense Forces," to purify the command system of the National Defense Forces. According to this decree, the overall command of the army, navy, and air force was held solely by the Fuehrer Hitler. The National Defense Bureau, which had previously been an auxiliary organ of the National Defense Forces High Command, was promoted to the National Defense Forces High Command. The supreme commander of the National Defense Forces became the Fuehrer Hitler's subordinate, all other intermediate organs were abolished, and the leader directly appointed the commanders of the army, navy, and air force. This reform of the National Defense Forces command system not only promoted the unification of the command power but also made the structure of the party and the state, whose contacts had previously been less smooth, closer together, to ensure the perfect mobilization of forces. This naturally had great political significance. According to this reform, the Fuehrer Hitler, concurrently served as the party leader, the Prime Minister, and the supreme commander of the National Defense Forces, gathering the orders of the party, the state, and the military into one. Since the end of 1941, he has also served as the Commander-in-Chief of the Army. Under him, Marshal Keitel serves as the General Inspector of the National Defense Forces and Chief of the Staff of the Supreme Command, assisting the Supreme Commander. The Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force is Marshal Goering, and the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy is Grand Admiral Doenitz, each responsible for military affairs. (To be continued) (Hong.

<h3>Three Matters of Principle for Capital Increase of Insurance Companies; Supervisory Bureau Effectively Prevents the Occurrence of Malpractices</h3>
<p>The Insurance Supervisory Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, regarding the case of insurance companies increasing capital within a specified period, had previously issued a circular to all companies to comply with it. Now, in order to prevent the occurrence of malpractices, the Bureau has specially stipulated three items that should be paid attention to when insurance companies increase capital. In addition to reporting to the various cases, the Bureau yesterday especially inspected and issued the relevant points for attention, ordering the Shanghai Special City Insurance Industry Association to forward them to its member companies for compliance. Points for Attention: The capital increase of each company should be paid entirely in cash. It is strictly forbidden to use the company's assets as shares or to use undistributed profits to offset the stock price. Shares of each company's capital increase should be first offered to the old shareholders. If there is a surplus, then it can be raised elsewhere. The capital increase funds of each company should all be entrusted to the West District Office of the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank for collection. The funds cannot be withdrawn and used until all the funds have been collected and verified by this Bureau.</p>
<h3>Anhui County Political Meeting; Opening Ceremony Held Yesterday; A Respectful Telegram Sent to Chairman Wang</h3>
<p>Bengbu, 20th (Central News Agency): Since taking office, the Governor of Anhui Province, Luo Junqiang, has convened a provincial county political meeting to understand the local conditions of each county and strengthen the promotion of county political views. The opening ceremony of the meeting was held at 10:00 AM yesterday (the 20th) in the main auditorium of the Provincial Government, presided over by Governor Luo himself.

Attendees included heads of departments and bureaus, section chiefs, and county magistrates. After the opening ceremony was completed in a simple and solemn ceremony, a respectful telegram was unanimously passed to Chairman Wang for his congratulations. Group discussions continued in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Large German Aircraft Formation Heavily Bombs the Port of Hull; American Aircraft Attack Southern Germany Again</h3>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency): The German News Agency reported that a large formation of powerful German bombers flew over the Strait again before 2:00 AM today to launch a major attack on the British mainland. The weather was clear at the time, so the visibility was excellent.</p>
<p>Another dispatch stated that before midnight last night, a large formation of German bombers carried out a concentrated bombing of the port of Hull on the east coast of England. As far as is known, the results can be described as extremely satisfactory. The German aircraft that left the target area last saw many large fires in Hull and the port, especially in the dock area.</p>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency): The German military authorities announced that American bombers and long-range fighter squadrons attacked southern Germany across the Alps on the 19th. German aircraft immediately took off to intercept them and engaged in fierce air combat, shooting down 20 of their four-engine bombers and many fighter aircraft.</p>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency): The German Fuehrer's headquarters announced on the 19th that the British and American air forces suffered heavy losses in air raids on the German mainland and German bases in the north during the past 24 hours, losing a total of 93 aircraft, including 13 four-engine aircraft. The enemy air force bombed Munich and Friedrichshafen during the day, and Frankfurt was raided again on the night of the 18th, resulting in damage and casualties. A few British aircraft also made disruptive raids on central and northern Germany.</p>
<h3>New Iranian Cabinet Under Organization</h3>
<p>Ankara, 20th (Central News Agency): According to a dispatch from Tehran, Satteri has been ordered to organize a new Iranian cabinet. He has joined the circle multiple times.</p>
<h3>Situation Tightening in Western Europe; Germany Actively Strengthening Defenses</h3>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency): In the southern Eastern Front, Soviet troops are still advancing along the railway from Lviv to Odessa, and the communication between the two cities has been partially cut off. Judging from the current situation, the Soviet Union has no intention of easing its offensive and seems likely to take advantage of the situation to launch an attack on Romania in one fell swoop. However, the German army will also endure all sacrifices and do its best to stop the Soviet army on this defense line. It is believed that the German army will mobilize a considerable number of reserve troops in this area, and they are currently being mobilized. According to observations by military experts here, when the pressure from the Soviet army in this area increases in the future, Germany, in order to prepare for the Allied forces to launch an offensive in Western Europe, will definitely withdraw a part of its forces to defend Western Europe. This is the opportunity for the Allies to land in Western Europe. The recent bombing of Germany by the British and American air forces has not achieved remarkable results, so the British and Americans may concentrate their main forces in the future to bomb various industrial cities in Germany to thoroughly destroy the German air force before the British and American troops land. The opportunity for the opening of the Second Front now seems imminent. Furthermore, the British and American air forces have repeatedly attempted to bomb Berlin, and they have engaged in large air battles with German fighter aircraft with a large number of long-range fighter aircraft during the day, attempting to deplete the German fighter aircraft. Therefore, when the British and American forces land in Western Europe, the power of the German air force may be slightly reduced. It is now reported that the British and American armies have gathered in Eipul and various coastal areas of southern England. In short, the situation on the western European coast is gradually becoming tense.</p>
<h3>Italy Axis Counter-Offensive Fails; Germany Defends Cassino</h3>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) – German military authorities announced that the Allied forces' operations at Nettuno and Anzio bridgehead have lasted for 60 days, resulting in losses of 15,000 personnel and 500,000 tons of ships. The Allied landing operations on the flank of Nettuno began with the landings at Liri and Termoli on September 9th and October 14th of last year. One of their objectives was to quickly break through the Cassino front and encircle the German forces there. Another objective was to capture Rome through a lightning attack, but it ended in failure.</p>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) – The German Supreme Headquarters war report of the 19th stated that Allied forces, with tank support, continued to fiercely attack Cassino. German forces, with the assistance of the Air Force, repelled them after fierce fighting. Elsewhere, German forces launched a courageous counterattack, recapturing the northwestern part of Cassino city, which had been reduced to ruins.</p>
<h3>Romania Takes Emergency Measures, Determined to Defend Territory</h3>
<p>Zurich, 20th (Central News Agency) – The Soviet offensive in the southern sector of the Eastern Front is gradually approaching the Romanian border. According to news from Bucharest, Romanian forces have constructed defenses along the Dniester River, preparing to engage the enemy. Furthermore, garrisons from various parts of Romania are being deployed to Bessarabia for reinforcement. Additionally, the Romanian Central Bank has been relocated from Tiraspol, and Romanian ships docked at the port of Odessa have been ordered to leave immediately.</p>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from Bucharest, the war in the southern sector of the Eastern Front is gradually approaching the Romanian border, with fierce fighting currently unfolding before the country's borders.

<p>Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency) – German military authorities announced on the 19th that Soviet vanguard units have recently crossed the Dniester River, with intentions to advance further south.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting Unfolds on Former Polish Border</h3>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) – German military authorities announced on the 19th that German forces fought a desperate battle at Kovel, 70 kilometers northwest of former Zhitomir. They were finally forced to abandon part of the town on the evening of the 18th. Both sides suffered heavy losses in the battle.</p>
<h3>German Forces Abandon Two Cities in Southern Sector</h3>

<h3>Roosevelt-Churchill Meeting Considered Possible</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 20th (Central News Agency) – According to a Reuters report, Swedish newspapers claim that rumors from Washington indicate that Roosevelt and Churchill will meet again. Although not officially confirmed, it is indeed possible. If Roosevelt and Churchill do meet again, the purpose will not be to discuss the war aims of Britain and America, as Britain is currently apparently disregarding discussions on this matter. British leftists are criticizing the increasing number of those who do not adhere to the Atlantic Charter, and strongly advocate that British foreign policy should be clearly explained. London political figures believe that British leftists lack the traditional experience of the Conservative Party, and do not understand the meaning of power politics. They have forgotten that the various declarations of the Atlantic Charter are only for adapting to the current general war situation. Swedish newspapers also claim that Roosevelt also hopes that the foreign policy of the Allies can be clarified before the next presidential peak. The London Observer believes that agreements initiated by Under Secretary of State Sumner Welles can be expected to be approved when Roosevelt and Churchill meet.</p>
<h3>Romanian Press Harshly Criticizes US Peace Overtures</h3>
<p>Bucharest, 10th (Central News Agency) – The "Current Events" newspaper here has resolutely rejected the American call for Romania to accept the Allied peace terms. The newspaper cited a commentary in the New York Times stating that "the time seems ripe for the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union to issue a joint statement on the political situation in the Balkans," and criticized it, saying that no one is asking the Allied side for such a statement. If the United States wants to know what Europeans think, it should know that anti-Soviet sentiments overshadow all war issues.</p>

<h3>Current Affairs Musings</h3>
<p>—Tokutomi Sohō</p>
<p>I am definitely not trying to create panic, but this war can be said to be unprecedented and unrepeatable. It is a great sacred war that has continued since the founding of the nation by Emperor Jimmu's Eastern Expedition. I believe that comparing Emperor Jimmu's Eastern Expedition with today's Greater East Asia Holy War is most appropriate. Although every war in Japanese history has its own significance, the Eastern Expedition was a war to unify the Japanese archipelago, and the Greater East Asia War is a war to unify the entire Asian continent. The Jimmu Eastern Expedition is the premise, while this Greater East Asia War is the conclusion. From a historical perspective, these two great wars are blood-related and closely connected.</p>
<p>We must understand the reason why the Holy War is a Holy War. We are definitely not fighting to plunder oil. Nor are we fighting to plunder rubber. Nor are we fighting to plunder iron and tin. We are fighting to protect the world, to eliminate the demons that will bring the world to an irrecoverable catastrophe. The so-called demons in the world are of course Britain and America! If you carefully examine their actions, no demon can surpass them. One of their own citizens, Milton, described Satan in his book "Paradise Lost," but compared to today's Churchill and Roosevelt, Satan still has some masculine spirit and the demeanor of a demon leader. However, the heads of today's demons are really not worthy of Milton's pen. Apart from being called old men who are "thieves and bandits," there are no other more appropriate complimentary words to praise them.</p>
<p>If you look at the numbers, the Mongol army that attacked Japan and the number of our Japanese soldiers have a huge difference. But at that time, our Japanese national policy was unified and consistent. Every corner of every remote village was filled with the ambition to conquer mountains and rivers and to kill the enemy and achieve success abroad. Some people even advocated that instead of defending on the Genkai Sea, it would be better to advance and counterattack the mainland. The Great Mongol Empire, which spanned three continents of Europe, Asia, and Africa, could not exert its power on Japan because of the strong and vigorous spirit of solidarity against the enemy in Japan. Although they often wanted to conquer Japan, they thought the Japanese were very brave and could not be conquered, so they abandoned their ambition to send troops. Their unfavorable calculation finally told them to give up sending troops to invade. In return, they believed that invading Japan would cost a great price, and whether the gains were certain was still unknown. This was their concept of "not worth the loss." Even later, in the Ming Dynasty, not sending troops to Japan was considered a good plan. This was the practical lesson left to them by the Yuan Dynasty, and they realized that invading Japan was a foolish thing. Therefore, from beginning to end, they dared not harbor any covetous intentions. So, it is said that the best secret to victory is to use solidarity against the enemy to crush the enemy's attempts and make the enemy deeply aware that they cannot win, creating a psychological despair for the enemy. This is the best policy. The most important thing to thoroughly subdue the enemy is patience. People often say that victory lies in the last five minutes, which refers to this. It is like two children standing in a river fighting a water fight. If neither is willing to give up, there will never be a winner. Only when one side cannot bear the discomfort and admits defeat, and the other side can endure, can a winner be determined. Therefore, a major element of victory is patience.</p>
<p>However, food is necessary for patience. If your stomach is empty and you still say you are not hungry, this kind of patience can only be limited to a temporary moment and cannot last. So, at any time, you cannot endure an empty stomach. Although enduring an empty stomach is also a kind of patience, for the sake of greater patience, this kind of patience like enduring an empty stomach should not be necessary. Besides food, there are also military supplies and human resources. Taking the most immediate situation as an example, it is right to manufacture more sophisticated aircraft and train more skilled and brave pilots. Today, our Japanese government authorities are using all their strength to make rapid progress in this regard, which is naturally something that should be done. In any case, the main task at present is, as Confucius said, to have sufficient food and sufficient soldiers. Confucius also said: "When there is sufficient food and sufficient soldiers, the people will begin to trust them." This word "trust" is the most important of all. The so-called "trust" is the belief in victory. However, the belief in victory comes from understanding the purpose of our Holy War. Today, we are acting on behalf of Heaven, shouldering the sacred task of eliminating the six enemies of mankind. It is a set policy to complete this mission. We have no doubt about our chances of victory. We should consciously grasp this task and must complete this task. If so, the so-called final victory will definitely belong to us.

<h3>Conflict of British and American Interests in Developing West Asian Oil Fields</h3>
<p>The US government's plan to develop the Arabian oil field area has caused considerable debate in the US Congress. Senator O'Mahoney, a vanguard of the Democratic Party who attacks the government, demanded the dissolution of the American Petroleum Reserve Corporation, which is active in obtaining Arabian oil field concessions. The old isolationist party also criticized Roosevelt for not trying to win over Churchill.</p>
<p>The conflict between Britain and the United States caused by the oil concession issue of Bahrain Island is also a recent event. The amount of money the United States intends to invest in developing Arabian oil fields is approximately US$410 million (of which US$110 million is for pipelines and plant construction). It is said that this plan has been agreed upon by Ickes, the director of the Wartime Fuel Adjustment Bureau and president of the Petroleum Reserve Corporation, and the British Overseas Oil Allocation Committee. The Soviet Union has not yet been consulted, but the Soviet Union has also requested to obtain an oil port in the Persian Gulf.</p>
<h3>Domestic Opposition</h3>
<p>Furthermore, the US development of West Asian oil resources is in conflict with British oil concessions in that region, developing into a difficult diplomatic issue. There is also strong opposition within the country, and the position of Ickes, the wartime fuel director in charge, is quite difficult. James Murphy, former vice president of Mobil Oil Company, also launched a vigorous opposition movement against the above-mentioned government plan, pursuing Ickes's responsibility and demanding his resignation. To complete this plan, at least US$200 million of huge funds are required, and 500,000 tons of steel need to be used. But what is the result? The oil transport cost between Texas and New York in Britain is only 11 cents per bushel, while in the new plan, the transport cost from Arabia to Egypt is as much as 24 cents per bushel, plus 15% of the loss of oil in transit. From an economic point of view, it is extremely unwise. (Xiang:) Translated from the March 6th issue of Tokyo Asahi Shimbun)</p>

<h3>The Commercial Control Association Holds a General Meeting of Members; The Executive Yuan Appoints Cai Shengbai and Others as Preparatory Members</h3>
<p>The National Commercial Control Association, having received a joint letter from all directors and supervisors of the association, stated: "Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, our government has had to control various important commodities in order to establish a wartime economic system, and to take into account public opinion, the National Commercial Control Association was specially established to assist the government with commercial autonomous groups, improve the material management system, and complete the wartime economic system. When the preparatory organization began in March of last year, subordinate organizations, such as the Joint Association and the trade associations under it, were either waiting to be organized or waiting to be adjusted. It was difficult for the members to elect directors and supervisors from among the representatives. As a temporary expedient, the government appointed us to temporarily fill these positions. In addition to being appointed, we deeply feel that the responsibilities are not light. Until today, the various lower-level organizations have been established and adjusted in order. The representatives attending the meeting have also been recommended one after another, and the resolutions have been reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors and Supervisors of the Association, and have been reported to the government for records. According to the provisions of the Provisional Charter of the Association, the term of office of directors and supervisors is one year, and there are not many days left before the term expires. The government should be requested to convene a general meeting of members in accordance with the law, and to elect the next directors and supervisors from among the representatives to conform to the original purpose of commercial group autonomy. As for the preparatory work for the general meeting of members, it seems that the government should also be requested to designate several people from the attending representatives to be responsible for handling the matter, in order to show fairness. We hereby jointly write a letter, hoping that you will examine and forward it for approval." After receiving the letter, the Commercial Control Association, in accordance with Article 21 of the Provisional Charter of the Association, which states: "When the term of office of the directors and supervisors of the Association expires or there is a vacancy, it shall be handled in accordance with the Provisional Regulations of the National Commercial Control Association," should be handled in accordance with the regulations. The Association prepared a roster of members' representatives and forwarded it to the Executive Yuan, and requested that several people be designated from among the representatives attending the meeting to be responsible for handling the preparatory work for the general meeting of members. According to the reporter's investigation: The Association has received instructions from the Executive Yuan: "Cai Shengbai, Li Ze, Shi Lüqing, Xu Xiaochu, Liu Jingji, Chen Zishan, Zhu Chunbo, Wang Yuqing, Shen Jinzhou, Pan Xusheng, Jiang Hongbin, Xiang Shengwu, Chen Bofan, Ye Youcai, Cheng Nianpeng, Zheng Yuandian, Shen Weiting, Cai Zixiang, Yang Shaozhen, and Cao Qiming are appointed as preparatory members for the general meeting of representatives, and Cai Shengbai is appointed as the convener. You should immediately comply and report accordingly." After receiving the order, the Association immediately sent letters to all directors and supervisors and instructed the preparatory members to be informed, and also sent a letter to Cai Shengbai requesting him to comply and report on the situation of compliance, so that it could be forwarded for records.</p>

<h3>Numerous Robbery Cases Occurred; Repeat Offender Gang Caught; The Laozha District Police Substation Arrested Eight Robbers</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of the light control in this city, petty thieves and robbers have been active, taking the opportunity to rob passersby of their belongings. The First Police Bureau ordered all police substations to step up their guard and send police officers to patrol the streets. It also ordered the police brigade to assist in patrols in various districts. The Laozha District Police Substation received a telephone report from the Xinguang Cinema at 10:30 pm on the 18th, stating that robbers with weapons were stripping pedestrians of their property at the Ningbo Road intersection. The sub-bureau chief Hong Hanbin and Fu Xia, along with the chief of the judicial section Liu Junqing, the chief of the anti-robbery section Chen Jinzhang, the detective Huang Yingjie, and a large number of detectives, rushed to the scene to arrest the robbers and implemented a blockade in the entire district. The robbers opened fire and resisted arrest upon hearing the police, and then fled into the Xinguang Cinema. The detectives arrested the robbers on the spot and took them to the bureau. The robbers confessed their names as Jia Yihai, 25 years old, from Shaoxing, living at Room 41, Southeast Hotel, GuiPing Road. They had five or six accomplices who specialized in stripping pedestrians of their clothes at night. The bureau went to the address and arrested accomplices Wang Bingnan, 23 years old, from Zhenjiang, Xi Wenxing, 21 years old, from Jiading, Gu Xuefu, 18 years old, from Tongzhou, Yan Jinlin, 22 years old, from Shaoxing, Yang Bolin, 19 years old, from Shanghai, totaling six people.</p>

<h3>Songping, Director of the Intelligence Department, Published His Impressions of His Visit to Suzhou; Chinese and Japanese People Show a Spirit of Cooperation</h3>
<p>The Chinese and Japanese people show a spirit of cooperation.</p>
<p>Songping, the director of the intelligence department of the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy in China, went to Suzhou on the 17th for official business and returned to Shanghai on the 19th after completing his work. He published his impressions of his inspection of Suzhou, stating that Suzhou is the birthplace of the Purifying the Countryside Movement. Suzhou, two years after the Purifying the Countryside Movement, is bound to have made more progress than other places, so he made this trip. During his stay in Suzhou, he visited the provincial government authorities and factories, and his impressions were excellent. For example, he visited the Suzhou Lun Textile Factory. The factory was previously managed by the military, but it has now been returned to its original owner, Yan Qingxiang. Although the factory feels that there is a shortage of raw materials and fuel, it is still working hard to increase production, and its products are supplied to both Chinese and Japanese people in the local area. The factory is working hard on the cooperation between the Chinese and Japanese business circles. The second is the efforts of the Jiangsu Provincial Government to communicate Chinese and Japanese cultural work. The Provincial Japanese Language School was established and opened on February 20, with more than 30 students. The school not only teaches Japanese, but also offers courses in politics, economics, and culture. A Japanese-style house has also been built in the provincial government so that people can learn about Japanese customs and habits as a tool for Chinese-Japanese cultural penetration, with far-reaching intentions. These are all manifestations of Chinese-Japanese mutual assistance in completing the Greater East Asia War. Other examples include the assistance of local Japanese soldiers and civilians to China. Recently, five professors from Tongwen College assisted in the work of purifying the countryside in Wuxi and Jiangyin. Mr. Dang Yong, a Japanese expatriate in Suzhou and the general manager of Suzhou Construction Materials Company, provides various kinds of assistance to Chinese farmers. His wife is particularly enthusiastic about poverty relief and medical care, so she is highly respected and admired by the farmers. The "Buddha's Temple" in Suzhou is another example, spreading religion and working on Chinese-Japanese cultural communication while helping Chinese refugees. It also established a Japanese language school, etc. It is also quite popular among the people in Suzhou. There are many examples of Chinese and Japanese people working hard to cooperate, which shows that the Chinese and Japanese people are moving towards close cooperation.</p>
<h3>Analyzing Recent European Developments</h3>
<p>The regular press briefing of the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy in China was held at the Cathay Hotel yesterday at 2:30 PM.  The Embassy was represented by Information Minister Matsudaira, Vice-Consul Fukuma, and other officials.  Reporters from various Shanghai newspapers were present. Minister Matsudaira provided a very detailed analysis of the recent European situation, focusing on the differences among England, the United States, and the Soviet Union. The following is a record of his remarks:</p>
<p>Although the three countries of England, the United States, and the Soviet Union outwardly presented a united front on European policy at the Tehran Conference, an analysis of the recent European situation after the conference reveals that the three countries have differing opinions and increasing friction. Examples are as follows: To appease the Soviet Union, England does not hesitate to compromise Poland, agreeing to the Soviet Union's annexation of a large part of Polish territory. Although Poland requested help from various countries, the United States was caught in the middle and simply resolved the matter with verbal assurances. Within Yugoslavia, the guerrillas are divided into two factions: one supported by England and the other by the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union demanded that England cease its aid. England eventually relented, automatically abandoning support for the Mihailović guerrillas and submitting to the Soviet Union. England and the United States disagree on the establishment of a Jewish state. The United States advocates establishing a Jewish state in Palestine, while England sympathizes with the pan-Arab movement. England and the United States are competing for oil development rights in Persia (Iran), with both countries attempting to dominate. The Soviet Union suddenly recognized the Italian Badoglio regime without notifying England or the United States in advance. The United States expressed dissatisfaction with this, and U.S. Secretary of State Hull issued a statement refusing to recognize it. Turkey is unwilling to join the anti-Axis powers. Turkey deeply understands that if it joins the alliance with England and participates in the war, it will inevitably bear the brunt. The conflict between English and Soviet forces is bound to occur in Turkey, becoming even more blatant. Therefore, Turkey is trying its best to maintain neutrality. Soviet diplomats are very active in the northeastern part of the Mediterranean, which has aroused British concern. Recently, Dr. Malan of the Union of South Africa, on March 16, even made an anti-Soviet speech, saying: If the anti-Axis forces win in the future, it will inevitably lead to the spread of communist forces. Therefore, to prevent communist forces, it is advisable to assist Germany in defeating the Soviet Union. In short, the current European situation is very complicated. The increasingly divergent opinions of England, the United States, and the Soviet Union make it difficult to be optimistic about the anti-Axis powers' path to victory.</p>
<h3>Government Clarifies Officialdom, Shanghai Circles Express Support, General Prices Already Declining</h3>
<p>The National Government, in order to clarify officialdom and punish corruption, has conducted thorough investigations for several months. It has already sentenced to death in Beijing former Director of the Food Department's Aquatic Products Administration, Hu Zheng, and Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Food Administration, Hou Dachun, for major fraud in the procurement of military grain. When the news spread, people in all circles of Shanghai were excited. This measure serves as a warning to unscrupulous officials and merchants and is the greatest manifestation of suppressing hoarding, stabilizing prices, and securing the people's livelihood. Since then, general prices in Shanghai have already started to decline. Government officials stationed in Shanghai and relevant agencies have been reassured and are conscientiously working at their respective posts. It is reported that various financial institutions in the city and all sectors hope that the government will continue to conduct thorough investigations and punish corrupt merchants and poor officials. Once the national politics are clean and honest, industry and commerce and the people will be able to abide by the law and develop their businesses.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>General Uprising Movement</h3>
<p>In order to concentrate all efforts on enhancing production, the Japanese government decided at the cabinet meeting on the 25th of last month to adhere to the decisive battle and disregard prices. To date, twelve items, including the concrete requirements to stop high-end entertainment, have been announced and implemented. Simultaneously with this, there is the National General Uprising Movement, the main goal of which is to enhance production. The Japanese National General Uprising Movement, so far, includes: 1. Restricting passenger transportation, with the aim of enhancing combat power and evacuating the population for air defense. 2. Strengthening the women's volunteer corps system, with the aim of enabling unmarried women to cooperate in manual labor. 3. Implementing measures to encourage labor and boost morale, with the aim of rapidly improving the labor efficiency of industrial plants. Among the above three implementation guidelines, two are purely focused on enhancing production.</p>
<p>We believe that such a National General Uprising Movement is most suitable for today's extremely sluggish production sector in China. In other words, the remedy contained in the National General Uprising Movement is the only good medicine for treating anemia and neurasthenia in today's Chinese production sector and should be adopted by the entire nation, both high and low. At a time when speculation is no longer feasible, officials and the people should cooperate and work hard to promote various production undertakings. Those in supervisory positions should thoroughly supervise the production sector to improve the labor system and refresh labor management. Those in management positions should strive to strengthen factory organizations and rapidly improve factory production efficiency. The previous decline is like yesterday's death, and the subsequent effort is like today's birth. There must be a general uprising in the economic sector in order to speak of a leap in wartime production.</p>
<h3>Grain Trade Groups Demand Unified Rationing, Petition City Government Together Yesterday</h3>
<p>Various grain trade groups, such as noodle making, cooked food, tea snacks, and sliced noodle and congee industries, along with the trade union, yesterday morning at 10:00 AM dispatched representatives, including chairmen of each association, Huang Jingqi, Wang Bing, Wang Jinwen, and Zhao Zhixing, to the Special Municipal Government and the Flour Unified Allocation Office to petition for the prompt allocation of flour to all businesses in the first district (including the former eight districts) that legitimately need it. They also requested that, in accordance with the Executive Yuan's approval, the special allocation of each industry be concentrated under the Unified Allocation Office for coordinated distribution to ensure fairness and avoid ambiguity. At the same time, they stated the difficulties faced by members of each industry and requested prompt relief measures to maintain their businesses.</p>
<h3>Flour Factories Change to Daytime Operations</h3>

<p>The rain from yesterday continues to fall today. It must be the plum rain season.</p>
<p>I am very tired from the lectures on navigation and shipbuilding. Without worrying about the outcome of the exam, I must first aim to develop real ability. I will not follow officers without real ability.</p>
<p>June 11th (Saturday) Sunny.</p>
<p>The first clear day after a long rain. Wearing the military uniform of the Second Bridge today, my heart is very happy with this bright appearance.</p>
<p>After cleaning, while carrying the dinghy, the hook was lost. I am very ashamed to have lost it while I was responsible for guarding it.</p>
<p>There was land combat training, and a defense battle with the position. Although we were the attacking army, the defensive army quickly converted to offensive, so I heard we fell into a chaotic state. Although it was due to the poor command of the company commander, it was also due to a lack of combat spirit.</p>
<p>July 6th (Eternal Summer) Sunny.</p>
<p>Although the exam has ended, the time is only very normal, so I do not regret being safe and sound. I can only advance towards my duty.</p>
<p>After dinner, there was the movie "Defense at Sea." The broadcast was completed. It was a speech by a naval giant about the current situation. Afterwards, the supervisor gave a warning: "Be cheerful," "Conserve materials," and "No smoking," etc. Before the student team, it was really helpful to ban smoking. I admire it very much.</p>
<p>July 20th (Water) Sunny</p>
<p>We in the Ordnance Department must also understand the hard work of weapon production and pay attention to the improvement of military equipment.</p>
<p>Swimming training requires only effort, and communication (Note: Communication training) can be further strengthened with effort.</p>
<p>August 23rd (Fire) Sunny.</p>
<p>Starting this week, I am determined to exert myself and be especially nervous, but I fell asleep in the "Navigation" class, which is shameful. The instructor often says, "Our work is also a service to the country. If you can think of it this way, you won't doze off." That's right. I must correct this.</p>
<p>September 18th (Sunday) Sunny.</p>
<p>School Anniversary, Hachiman 例祭 (annual festival). At 10:30 I went out to the 330th Association (Note: Kagoshima Prefecture Association). Major M said that performance at military school is important, but that is only a part of naval life. Efforts after graduation are more important. Furthermore, being noticed by superiors is also a sign of a promising future.</p>
<p>September 27th (Tuesday) Sunny.</p>
<p>I welcomed the arrival of His Imperial Highness, and the graduation ceremony for the 60th class was held. After the graduation ceremony, I gave a speech as Chief of the Naval General Staff. I vowed to serve the country to the death with excitement. With this gratitude, I will move forward from tomorrow.</p>
<p>September 28th (Water) Sunny.</p>
<p>At the appointment announcement ceremony, I was appointed squad leader and became student number one. After two and a half years of waiting, I finally became number one, and I deeply feel the weight of responsibility. Although education that prohibits corporal punishment is good, it must not allow the student hall to become an existence that has lost its spirit. This must be considered.</p>
<p>October 7th (Gold) Sunny</p>
<p>Hitler Youth visited.</p>
<p>In welcoming today's 50th anniversary of the establishment of the military flag, looking up at the radiant naval flag of the rising sun, thinking of the deep meaning within it as we are now on the path of the Holy War, it strengthens our beliefs.</p>
<p>From the letter of a candidate, I learned that if you do not study hard while in school, the future will be difficult. So-called bravery of blood is not successful, and we must work hard in the future.</p>
<p>October 16th (Sunday) Sunny. If it is said to be a ball-playing weather, it is certainly very cold. The so-called blood energy of courage is not a successful trial, forced by the present, so all are working hard in the self-study room.</p>
<p>A servant is cleaning the latrine, and because he did not know he began to urinate in the latrine, and thinking about it, it is really embarrassing. He did this mistake when people did not know.</p>
<p>October 20th Century Auspicious (Earth) Cloudy, sometimes rainy.</p>
<p>The exam is over, and I am preparing for the "Early Thousand Early" educational assignment in the morning.</p>
<p>5:30, Exit, all the way to Takamatsu.</p>
<p>Night sailing, on duty for two hours. The so-called Always on the deck, one's knowledge will be broadened.</p>
<p>National Forum</p>
<h3>Improvements in Forced Grain Purchases</h3>
<p>— Song Qingxiang</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Rice Control Association, its rationed quantity has not satisfied the citizens. The reasons for this, although due to the unsoundness of the control mechanism and the lack of personnel unity, the daily price difference with the black market rice price is too large, easily causing the office staff to see the benefit and take advantage of it. But the most important thing is that the purchasing area disregards the farmers' capital and forcibly suppresses the price of purchases, causing the local farmers to regard the purchase as a long journey. All rice and chestnuts are either used to brew wine and food, or to transform other substances to avoid the purchase by the authorities, or even to change the area of rice and wheat cultivation to other crops that avoid being purchased in order to seek high profits. Such planting is difficult to fully describe. If the method of forced purchase is not improved for a long time, not only will the quantity of rice rations not increase in the future, but the panic of rice and grain will become more and more serious. Seeing the black market rice price becoming more expensive, the food problem is unimaginable.</p>
<p>I believe that for the establishment of a public welfare undertaking, the relevant local authorities should provide considerable assistance, and so should the transportation agencies. If the Rice Control Association offers the local market price to farmers in the rice-producing areas to purchase grain, and then consults with the transportation agencies to reduce the freight as much as possible, after transporting the rice, the Association should distribute an adequate amount to all citizens at the original purchase price to meet their daily needs. If this is the case, the farmers in the purchased area will have a considerable profit from their labor, without losing their capital. They will definitely offer all their crops to the purchasing agency as much as possible. Furthermore, the citizens of Shanghai can purchase an adequate amount of rationed food at a price slightly higher than the current price, avoiding relying on the black market. Since citizens do not need to purchase expensive food on the black market, the black market will naturally disappear. With the black market gone, the Rice Control Association will be able to fulfill its responsibility of unified allocation by successfully obtaining an adequate amount of rice. I hope that the ruling authorities will pay attention to this.</p>
<h3>The Purpose of Establishing Jishan Library</h3>
<p>— Liu Zhifang</p>
<p>The late philosopher Liu Zongzhou was a great Confucian of the late Ming Dynasty, whose scholarship followed the Yangming school. He was loyal and passionate throughout his life, and upright and unyielding. He once lectured at the Jishan Academy in Shaoxing, and was called Mr. Jishan. Fellow villagers in Shanghai admired the spirit of the wise men, so Zhifang and others formed the Jishan Society in the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), with the aim of promoting culture and pursuing educational and charitable undertakings. Furthermore, due to the soaring prices of books, the progress of culture has been greatly affected, and vocational youths and students who need extracurricular materials are all deeply troubled by economic difficulties. There are not many libraries in Shanghai, and due to geographical reasons, they cannot be widely circulated. Therefore, we jointly established the Jishan Library with Mr. Mao Panxi, the founder of the Benliu Bookstore, investing one million yuan to collect more than 20,000 books and novels of various kinds, so that young people can use their spare time to improve their studies and morals, and also to reduce unnecessary consumption. Now, in order to uphold the purpose of popularizing education and assisting young people in seeking knowledge, it is not limited to those from Shaoxing, and young people from all walks of life can apply to join and borrow books free of charge. (Just notify by phone, and we will order the driver to exchange books so as to avoid inconvenience for readers.) The opening is scheduled for the 22nd of this month, to welcome guests from all walks of life and to begin circulation. The address is at 127 Liuhe Road, inside the Shaoxing Fellow Villagers Association. Telephone number 95569.</p>
<h3>Children's Library Seeks Children's Books</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Children's Library, to celebrate Children's Day on April 4th, will hold a children's calligraphy and painting exhibition at the main library on April 2nd. It plans to collect children's works from all over the city for free viewing and has now collected some works. Children are welcome to donate excellent works for display and donate books and paintings. Please send them to Mr. Yongyu of the Sichuan Road Fourth Bank Savings Society or to the Linchun Main Library and the Dahua Shopping Mall branch.</p>
<h3>Memorial Service for Social Worker Mr. Ping Shujin</h3>
<p>Social worker Mr. Feng, formerly known as Mr. Feng Shujin, and others previously founded the Five Religions Bookstore with Shen Xinqing, Ding Fubao, Yao Minghui, and Huang Jianxian, and jointly organized the Buddhist Compassionate Nursing Home, Abstinence from Killing Society, Classics Lectures, and other groups. He also served as the manager of the Shanghai Medical Bookstore, devoting himself to public welfare undertakings. Unfortunately, he passed away last month due to overwork. The parks have jointly organized a memorial service on Saturday, March 25th, at 2:00 PM at the Qielu Jushilin Temple. If you would like to contribute memorial texts, please send them to the Medical Bookstore at 204 Mei Baige Road before the deadline.</p>
<p>Donated Meningitis Prescription Shanghai Buddhist Charity Association is raising funds to print and distribute effective prescriptions for meningitis and reliable prescriptions for kala-azar, which are currently popular, for the purpose of helping poor rural areas in the interior. Starting today, they will be distributed at the newspaper's inquiry desk and the Sangna Le Agricultural Cooperative on Nanjing Road and the Xinyezhe branch at the Zhejiang Road intersection.</p>
<p>Acknowledgements Thank you to an anonymous donor for 400 yuan to the nursing home, and to Mr. Xie for 300 yuan to the mother of Xi Xinghai and 200 yuan to a sick teacher. We offer our thanks here.</p>
