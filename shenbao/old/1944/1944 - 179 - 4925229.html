<p>社評</p>
<h3>商統會調整以後</h3>
<p>全國商業統制總會，調整機構，更動人事，新理事長聞蘭亭氏陳墍各理監事定今日正式就職接事。據報載前日該會新舊理監事舉行臨時聯度會議，互選林康侯，袁履登，孫仲立，陳子彝，羅納齊為小寶常務理事，並推定林康侯為總會秘書長。實際上商統會之下的米糧，棉業，粉麥，油糧，日用品各統制委會的常務理事。換句話說，商統會的常務理事，就是各統制委員會的最高負責人及總會的實際負責人。這樣的人事布置，在客觀上很合職權一元的理想。</p>
<p>商統會成立於去年三月十五日，我們在去年四月十四日的社評，當商務會成立滿月之時，曾對該會提期望六事，而特別鄭重以「操守廉潔」四字相望。我們說：「在世風澆漓的今天，莫不誤認「統制」為「生財之道」，這固然一般人的齷齪心理，惟其如此，當事者更應格外小心，慎於錄用，嚴於考查，樹立楷模。過去曾利用統制機會，自肥之輩，萬勿容許插足，以維刷新人事之優點。</p>
<p>這次政府決定調整機構，我們也曾於六月十六日社評中提出希望四點。我們說：「人事問題在任何機關是最重要之問題，過去各統制機關之所以不能免於社會指摘，人事問題實佔最大成份。故各統制機關，今後對於用人一端，在才幹之外，尤當特別注重操守。……深盼工商界認清目前在戰時，絕非平時可比，過去以小我利益為前提者，應即放棄，而「減私奉公」，應為今後當局與各業共同採取之精神。」</p>
<p>上面重複提引的兩段話，我們認為還是值得今後商總會的注意。今天我們再以「奉公守法」四字，提供商統會及其所屬的負責當局以至全體工作人員。中國人最不合理的習慣，就是專顧私而而不顧公。只圖私利而不知守法。好講人情而不講法理。因無執法之人，遂無守法之人，已為普遍現象。尤其在戰時，一般環境特殊，反公違法者，暴利得逞，而奉公守法者，生活艱苦，於是前者視後者為沒出息，不中用，浸假而社會一般觀念，亦以違法暴利為有才幹，有能力，於是黑白混淆，是非顛倒了。過去統制工作的失敗，主因即在於此。</p>
<p>今後商統會雖為綜合監督指導機關，另由各統制委員會辦理實施統制工作，可是，對於各統制委員會工作步調，自應趨於一致，人事甄別，自應趨於健全，如有不妥，商統會有隨時糾正的絕對責任。至於目前的重要課題：（一）對於棉布收買工作，應從速結束，開特組棉業管理處管理委員會，專司其事，尤應負起責任。臨時配給，混亂複雜，應從速調整。（二）對於米統會的改組機構與人事調整，應從速實現，尤其在米糧秋收以前，關於收購的一切辦法與程序，應從速合理訂定，布置妥當。過去米統會公布的辦法條例，一般感覺不合現實環境，不近事理，因而每召致不良後果。（三）統制工作，辦事貴乎敏捷，必先顧到戰時經濟的重要性，以期增强戰力。其次，對於正當請求，不論識與不識，一視同仁，依照規定程序手續迅速處理，體恤商艱。况商統會具有商人自治精神的機構，絕非官僚機關，尤應剷除暮氣沉沉的官僚習氣。我們在商統會新人事就職之日，略實原則上的鬧意見，以為獻曝之計。</p>
<h3>日機夜襲塞班島轟炸敵殘留部隊　馬利亞納海面敵巡艦重創</h3>
<p>日軍某基地三十日中央社電　日空軍二十九日急襲於馬利亞納羣島海面游弋中之敵機，使敵大型巡洋艦一艘命中魚雷而受重創，日機安返基地</p>
<p>里斯本三十日中央社電　珍珠港電，美太平洋艦隊司令部二十九日發表稱，日軍機隊二十七日晚曾轟炸塞班島敵軍部隊之集結地點。</p>
<p>里斯本三十日中央社電　於塞班島登陸之美軍，在該島縱斷山脈與加拉邦市街內受莫大之損害，尼米資司令部二十七日將一切關於塞班島戰况之消息悉禁止發表，頗使國內新聞機關感覺驚異。二十八日夜美新聞機關竟一齊報稱，塞班島日軍之抵抗强化，是日美聯社珍珠灣電稱，塞班島日軍守備隊之抵抗仍極熾烈，二十八日已阻止美軍之前進。舊金山電台亦廣播謂，塞班之戰乃太平洋惡戰之一，均承認美軍正在苦戰。美聯社電報更稱，到達塞班南部之美海軍陸戰隊與步兵部隊，因日軍之猛攻分成四組，刻正苦戰中。</p>
<h3>第三戰區發動攻勢日軍精銳佔領衢州</h3>
<p>東京三十日中央社電　日本大本營三十日下午三時半發表：上海方面日軍部隊，呼應湖南作戰，於本月十日，對渝第三戰區軍發動攻勢，二十六日攻陷該方面渝軍重要據點衢州，刻正繼續激戰。茲誌開始本作戰以來，至二十六日所收獲之主要戰果如次：收容敵屍三千五百九十一具，俘虜五百八十九人，鹵獲大砲二十四門，槍械約九百枝。</p>
<p>浙江前綫某基地三十日中央社電　日機隊為掩護日軍陸上部隊，沿舊浙贛綫西進，以期覆滅該方面之渝軍，刻正不斷地浙江前綫，積極活動。二十四日急襲浙省渝軍戰略要地衢州，猛炸渝軍陣地及軍事設施，予渝軍以重創。日軍另一部隊，更發見渝軍約一千人，為救援衢州，渡過衢州西北方衢江，日機當以機槍對之掃射，使履江（衢江支流）江上渝軍屍體狼藉，頓呈混亂狀態，是役日機完成任務後，即安返原防云。</p>
<p>日軍前綫某基地三十日中央社電　浙江省西部之渝軍重鎮衢州城，於二十六日午前已入日軍掌握，即沿浙贛綫迫擊中之日軍精銳部隊，為期覆滅第三戰區之敵軍，二十三日於戰區之敵軍，二十三日於衢州平原，突破第三戰區顧視同指揮下之包圍陣後，即到處展開殲滅戰。日軍主力部隊更於前後受敵之環境下，以戰略上稀見之戰法，對衢州城展開攻擊作戰。各部隊以二十日黎明為期，一齊殺至敵城東南角及東門，此外日空軍亦與地上精銳呼應，展開熾烈轟炸。上午五時，遂自東南城角突入南門，當即展開市街戰，迫敵向城內西北角退卻，遂即將之完全殲滅。午前七時，該城即全機佔領，目下日軍正於該地附近展開掃蕩戰，擴大戰果中。</p>
<p>日軍前綫三十日中央社電　衢州已告陷落，茲述陷落經過如次：緣衢州縣城內之有渝軍主力，及百四十五師之一部。本月二十一日，以有四十九軍進駐，　機擾亂日軍後方，日軍除野戰軍外，並以有力部隊一部，自衢州南北夾擊。十九日隱密前進，抵達縣城附近，在衢州正面展開激戰後，渝軍竟誤認已將日軍包圍，迄未察覺日本之伏兵，日軍將渝軍大部擊潰後，以一部監視衢州西南之敵急調主力出動於衢州前方。自二十五日至二十六日未開，乘敵之虛而奇襲。斯時渝軍士氣相當旺盛，城西江中之軍船，均移向對岸，布背水之陣，然而城內聯絡斷絕，甚至尚不知日軍主力在何方，二十五日日機在城內上空散布觀降傳軍，渝軍又誤認日方攻擊力減退，在此種情勢下，日軍乃乘暗夜進抵城外，俟薄明一齊繼攻。更有空軍自上空投彈轟炸，。援助地上部隊，遂將渝軍二千餘名完全殲滅。此次佔領衢州間，可謂一奇襲殲滅戰。</p>
<h3>衡陽郊外在激戰中</h3>
<p>湖南日軍某基地三十日中央社電　湖南日軍沿粵漢綫南下，向衡陽進擊中之日進擊部隊，於二十六日黎明，出三面突入湘江東岸之衡陽機塲，即將之完全佔領，渝美空軍有力基地，遂入日軍之手。又日軍另一部隊，於湘江西岸南下，亦由北西南三面包圍衡陽機塲對岸之衡陽市，市內渝預備第十師第一百九十六師之主力，據其　堡子隱蔽槍座，作頑强抵抗，是故該地現正在激戰中。</p>
<p>里斯本三十日中央社電　據重慶電，渝軍當局，二十九日夜發表衡陽戰况如次：衡陽攻防戰，已更加熾烈。日軍迫近衡陽外廓，更增派兵力，及大量輕重武器。二十七日夜曾傾全力開始攻擊渝軍陣地，並與渝軍守備隊展開白刃戰，直至二十日夜，猶在激戰中。又衡陽刻在渝軍手中。</p>
<p>里斯本三十日中央社電　據重慶電，渝軍當局二十七日發表，衡陽東北地區依然繼續激戰。衡陽東方彡沬水與湘江中間地區，二十六日曾激戰終日，兩方均有傷亡，是役直延至夜間。按日軍佔領湘贛衡山後，即分其兵力為數隊南下，企圖共同進擊衡陽，渝軍於衡陽西北二十公里之地點迎擊之。衡陽市雖已成為戰火之中心，但市內仍平靜如恒。又據美聯社重慶防員訊，渝軍當局謂日軍於衡陽東方之大包圍企圖，或為欲切斷衡陽正方之粵漢綫，日軍現正進仁安。</p>
<p>里斯本三十日中央社電　據美聯社駐渝訪員訊，湖南戰况如次：渝軍當局宣稱，日軍一部隊已佔領距衡陽市三公里之東郊，其他日軍各部隊，則自北方及西北方强壓，刻已抵達距衡陽八公里之地點。攻擊衡陽南方之日軍，於該市南方九公里半之地點，遮斷粵漢綫，西方之日軍於西塘距衡陽二十公里，遮斷湘桂鐵路（衡陽桂林間），進至四塘之日軍部隊，由湘鄉南下，正進攻湘桂鐵路上之其他各地點。</p>
<h3>桂林等地民心動搖</h3>
<p>廣州三十日中央社電　西南戰局日漸開展，渝方西南地區之動搖，亦因之日益加甚。據美聯社重慶電稱，廣西省城桂林，已感到日軍進攻之威脅，銀行先後歇業，當戶均紛紛逃向內地，民心之動搖，已陷不可收拾之狀態。渝軍委會桂林辦公廳主任李濟琛，更作廣播謂，西南六省乃全國人口最稠密，土地最肥沃之地區，中國四萬萬人四分之一，均居住於此，中國近代革命指導者均產生於此，中國國家之精華，均集中於此，豐饒之六省民眾，與其逃亡，不如在此，如有逃避危難者，即為破壞民眾抗戰意識之罪人云。</p>
<h3>韶關渝軍圖決北江</h3>
<p>廣州三十日中央社電　湖南方面日軍部隊攻擊長沙後，繼續向南推進，近而攻佔衡陽之機塲，包圍衡陽市，渝軍極為狼狽。韶關方面渝軍當局，亦戰戰兢兢，並放出謠言，擴利用水漲期，潰決北江大壩，企圖妨碍和平區發展。查五年前湖南作戰之際，渝軍曾一度潰決黃河堤壩，圖阻碍日軍行動，但結果對日軍作戰上，絕無影響。所苦者為該地附近民眾，而目下渝軍復圖潰決北江，亦徒陷粵省民眾於苦境而已。</p>
<h3>際此重大時局下日德決緊密提携　重光外相接見記者談話</h3>
<p>東京三十日中央社電　日重光外相三十下午接見同盟社記者，就日·德關係談稱：德駐日大使史塔瑪，曾於二十八日晋謁東條首相，會談約達三小時之久，余亦參加，我駐德大島大使前曾屢次晋謁希特勒元首，交換責重意見。此次東京方面德大使拜謁東條首相，已見實現，東條首相展佈地圖，就目下戰而作詳細說明，史塔瑪大使亦曾陳述德國目下軍事·政治等情形。日·德兩國際此重大時局下，得有此種意見，足可表現日·德緊密提　，完成聖戰之決意。首相與德大使之會談，今後仍預定舉行。</p>

<h3>清鄉三周年紀念　政院長告同志書　協力爭取大東亞永久安全</h3>
<p>中央社訊行政院長為淸鄉三週年紀念，敬吿淸擲工作同志及各界同胞曰：</p>
<p>淸鄕工作開始於三十年七月，由國民政府設置淸鄕委員會主持其事。去年五月，中央決議解消淸鄕委員會，以其職權交付行政院，由是機構簡化，進行益見活發。三年以來，目覩淸鄉工作同志之奮鬥不懈，以及淸鄕地區各界同胞之同心同德，使整個淸鄕計劃，得以按步實施，至足佩慰，而盟邦方面之諸種協力，使淸鄉卒工作樽皺推進發展，尤深銘感，願乘此淸鄉週年紀念之機綠，略述抓曾言，為我淸鄕工作同志曁各界民眾吿：</p>
<p>其一，應以不自滿之心情求無限量之發展。自滿是功敗垂成之惡因，淸鄕工作主要目的，一曰肅正思想，二曰淸除匪共，三日確保治安，四曰增加生產。此種工作，三年以來，雖云有成，究未容引以桌滿。肅正思想，重在深度；淸除匪共，重在　度；確保治安，重在强度；增加生產，震在密度。如何使封建意識，及及英美思出絕其根株；如何使匪共肅淸之後，不再有兵來匪去，兵去匪來之循環現象，如何使各地民衆有自治自衛之能力，如何使同胞安居樂業，農村五穀皺登，都巿農村之物資圓滑交洗；有待於今後之努力者正多，吾人欲求前途無限量之發展，惟有再往前進。</p>
<h3>決不妥協</h3>
<p>其二，應以不妥協之精神，與惡腐勢力戰，妥協是妨害革命之毒菜，渝偽匪共，禍國殃民，必須激底撲滅，自無待言。此外，不良軍隊，不肖官更，不法奸商，日惟敲詐鑿索，舞弊營私，囤績居奇，以農工業生產者之血之汗，膏其　吻，均為過計民生之　賊，亦即情鄉工作同志，及各界民眾戰州之對致，尤摧陷而廓淸之，不可稍與妥協，表虎為患，徒貽後悔，誠如是，則惡腐勢力縱使詭計多端，伎倆百出，亦終必敗亡。</p>
<h3>不斷努力</h3>
<p>其三，應以不自餒之決心，為不間斷之努力。自　是失敗主義者之劣根性，淸鄕工作不僅限於一省一縣之織治安，實負有新時代之使命。新時代之使命維何？即與復中華，保衛東亞是也。其使命旣若是重大，則其任務之艱苦自不待言。然茍能把握着正確之路綫，向贅玆途之光阻，為不斷的努力，則途程上環境上一切之一切，皆不足以為吾人之陣碍。淸鄕工作之意義，以保障和平，拓展和平為　。以根絕英美洗毒，復我中華，還我東亞為經。然其對內意義言，即為中華復與，奠立不拔之基石。就其對外意義言，即所以協力完遂大東亞戰爭爭，取東亞之永久安全。以是之故，淸鄕工作多一分成就，即新時代之使命距完成點接近一步。吾人之責任即在於以銖積寸累之努力，求　積寸累之進步。能努力必能進步，有進步即有成就，其他一切，皆非所計。當此淸鄕工作第四年發足之始，正大東亞戰局，乃至世界戰局躍進一新决定階段。劇戰展開，勝利在望之時，時艱任震，莫過於是，存亡安危，亦　於是。吾人務」須以不自餒之決心，為不間斷之努力。使過去之努力，因最後一程最艱苦之奮鬥，而得以完成其終極之使命。救中國，保東亞，其道在是矣。</p>
<p>以上三點，前此累曾有所申述，而於今日，更覺其迫切，不憚贅言，願共勉旃。</p>
<h3>蘇陳省長　發表談話</h3>
<p>蘇州三十日中央社電　七月一日為淸鄉三週年紀念日，記者頃特訪謁陳省長，叩詢感想當蒙發表談話如次：「關於淸鄕工作意義之重要，本人就個人感想所及，謹這吾一同胞同志吿：　回憶民國三十平，國民政府淸鄕委員會設置註蘇軍事處，當」時本人任戰內政部長，曾奉命代表中央，助來監餐。其後為巡視淸鄕區黨務工作，亦曾來蘇，深覺朱淸鄕前與淸鄕後，江蘇省在民生洽安諸方面，皆有顯著進步。不僅當局者之努力盡職，要為蹤邦之指導協助，以及民眾之團結擁護，始克奏效者也。　現在本人負責者政，一切行政之事，自不免困難，究亦人力之不為所致。現惟有盡心力而為之，然與理想相距尙遠，此內心不僅止於慚愧者也。　淸鄕與省政更係合一，亦不可分之工作。大東亞戰爭今巳進入决戰階段，淸鄉工作之推展實不容緩。吾人鑒於盟邦之一心一德，刻苦耐勞，爭取勝利之精神，尤為感奮。吾人今日更應積極向上，奮發努力，完成淸鄉任務，以實行中國參戰之資任，恪遵汪主席訓示，與盟邦同甘共苦，同生共死，以完成興復中華，建設東亞之使侖。江蘇全省官民全體，各就工作本位，身體力行者也。舉此三點，以與吾同胞同志共勉之。</p>
<h3>日儲蓄有功者　受政府表彰</h3>
<p>東京三十日中央社電日本國足儲蓄運動，自中日事變後開始以來，至本年三月止，已突破千億兀之巨額，日政府為獎勵儲蓄起見，二十九日特發表衹表彰者之姓名。按日本國民之儲蓄運動，始於明治初年，至事變前止，七十年間之儲蓄總額，達四百四十六億元，但此次自事變當時起，至本年三月止，為期雖僅六年九個月，期間約為前者十分乏一，但儲蓄增加額已達十億元以上，約為前者之二倍强。此次受內閣總理大巨表彰者，團體三十五處，個人二十五人，受大妝大臣表彰者，團體二百八十五處，個人二百三十四人，受大藏省國民貯蓄局表彰者，團體千九十五處，個人九百四人，總計達二千五百七十八件。</p>
<h3>敵軍圍攻克恩城　展開坦克車大戰</h3>
<p>羅美爾念調援軍赴前錢</p>
<p>倫台特元帥司令部三十日中央社電　海通社戰地記者　渤稱：克恩西南，德英坦克車大戰激烈情形昨仍未衰，英軍　攻該城之舉，因德軍在克恩與維拉波卡公綫上反攻而吿中止，惟英軍勢將再圖自西南方進攻克恩。據負資方面稱，德軍在克恩西南之反攻，為德坦克車隊最有力之作戰，英軍以震型反坦克車砲之助，竟圖死守旣得之狹隘陣地，惟德軍「虎」「豹」準坦克車突入英軍陣地中心，摧毀其防禦坦克車工事。過去十二小時來，德軍擊毀英防禦坦克工事二十餘處，英軍奏克恩戰綫首次使用薩伏式大砲。</p>
<p>柏林三十日中央社電海通社訊：羅美爾上將調動援軍，前來北法戰區，準備應付急變，指揮鐵甲軍者為許維潘貝格將軍，潘氏戰前曾任駐英使館陸軍武官，哈塞將軍亦在北法戰區。</p>
<h3>反軸心艦開瑟堡港</h3>
<p>柏林三十日中央社電　德國新聞社海軍記者稱：昨晚曾有反軸心登陸用船進入瑟堡海港，但重兵艦則遭德砲隊所阻，未能逼近</p>
<h3>新登陸點德方預測</h3>
<p>柏林中央社電海通社訊，「柏林金融報」軍事評論家戈陶少將稱：協約軍或將以撒丁島及科西嘉島為根據地，在地中海區域作第二次登陸，但義國西海岸多山，不利於空輸部隊，義國北部登陸較便，德軍已有準備。至於法國南部蒙特貝里爾（Montpelier）區域壯宜於登陸。</p>
<h3>法內閣在巴黎召開緊急會議</h3>
<p>巴黎三十日中央社電電法政府昨日午前在此間召開緊急閣議，由賴伐爾首相司會，各閣僚及各長官等均出席，就各種震　政策，加以協議。</p>
<h3>日報道班員　從軍座談會</h3>
<p>農民表示感激</p>
<p>大島：我於二十一日由某地乘飛機出發，經過越州，因為飛機行很低，地上情形歷歷可見。我看見有許多中國民眾，協同日軍做事，聽說這都是他們自動的出來幫助日軍做事的，現在湖南一帶是桃杏成熟的時候，我們所經地方，到處桃杏發生，地方農民採取這種果物送給日本兵士，所以我們也對中國民眾惑謝的。以前外間盛傳日軍在佔領地區施行積暴，所以這次華北眾發令實行三勿主義，就是「勿燒，勿犯，勿殺」。這個命令澈底到每一個兵士，所以無論進註何地，軍律悛嚴，頗有秩序，所以鄭州陷落後，不到四五天，得歸的居民，每天達二三千人，現在完全恢復原狀了。日軍使用的軍用汽車，也有雇用的華籍司鑽人員開車，他們的待遇，完全同兵士」樣不分區別。</p>
<p>西島：日軍旣然那皺考慮中國足眾及其財產的安全，其行動寨然受相當的限制，那對於作戰不會發生影響嗎？</p>
<p>海野：部緻進行的前方若有田地或其他農產物，種租，不顧作戰上的不利，迂迴別處以免農村受損害，部隊願意為採取這樣迂迴行動而致受作職上百分之二的捐失，必在戰鬥方面加堅努力，以補償這百分之二的損失。</p>
<p>西島：河南方面日軍最高司令官，有「吿日軍將兵書」那個意思激底到每一個兵士了麽？</p>
<p>海野：大部份已經澈底了，可是還有一小部份的沒有知道。</p>
<h3>日軍的佈吿</h3>
<p>西島：還有日軍司令官的佈吿是對中國民眾發的，可否請　　軍官發表些意見。</p>
<p>軍官：凡一種戰爭應該有大義名分，若是這一點弄不淸楚戰爭繼續到長期，必至失了緊張精神，在中國事變後直至大東亞戰爭一旦爆發，戰爭大義的名分，便很清楚的顯示。戰至大東亞職爭發生時候為止，日本派遣軍在種種惡條件之下，進行戰爭，可是這次作戰則大不相同，試看派遣軍在華總司令的根本精神，就更會明賺，試觀日軍最高司令今次所發「吿日軍將士書」就明瞭其精神。</p>
<p>（該軍官於是提出「吿日軍將士書」及對中國民眾之佈告，「吿日軍將士書」略謂</p>
<p>「今次作戰目的，在於擊滅英美打擊甘為英美走狗之渝方抗日政　，而從戰禍之中救濟中國民眾，諸兵身處前方第一綫，應以最大慈愛對付中國民眾，一切行動對於天地無愧為要</p>
<p>不准危害中國民眾或加以暴行。　不准燒壞居民房。　除非有公事，不准亂入百姓家，又不准搶掠或破壞家具。　凡購買中國人物品，必須付給代價。　不准拉夫，雇用中國苦力時，必須進行應辦手續，且請中國人介紹苦力為要，對於　用苦力一律付給工資。</p>
<p>某他一張為對中總民眾之佈吿，其文如下</p>
<p>「為佈吿事，日本軍此次攻進駐當地目的，在於打破英美犧牲中國侵犯東亞之傳統的野心，扶助中國確立主權完成自由，並謀中日親善關係之促進實現。義師所向有攻必克，擊破英美及其附庸勢力，實行保境安民，各希居民，安居樂業，勿信謠言自相諸擾，下列數端咸使聞曉，庶明本軍大義：　日軍暫時駐兵截至保境安民完全實現時止。　日軍嚴重保證，駐兵區內民眾生命財產及其他一切天賦人權。　日軍駐兵區內絕無徵收稅捐或拉夫徵兵等事。凡區內民眾協力本軍提供物資或勞力，一律付給充分酬報。　日軍承認駐兵區內現行新幣及中央儲備券同時洗通。　日軍尊重鄕村習慣協助民眾實施自治制度，但日重截至治安確定，時近，暫施軍政。」某置官繼續談話謂</p>
<p>我們看這兩張紙就知道這次進攻長沙的戰爭意識並不在於三次攻陷長沙，乃是擊滅英美的戰爭，前方兵士們看見（40）型或者（B24）型等美國飛機莫不扼腕，而在眼前渝方軍隊，日軍以為是弟兄，因為他們的指導者走錯路驅使拙們到戰塲，這一次的戰爭確實是有大義名分的戰爭。還有一件是我要吿訴諸位德的，就是日本皇弟三笠宮殿下自從前年一月到本年一月之間，就任駐華軍要職，他常當敎訓他的幕僚說：「日本遣華軍，根本的目的是使得中國四萬萬的老百姓能够安居樂業，使中國及早實現統一成立近代國家。」三玆宮殿下巡視各地的時侯，若有機會常常接近中國民眾，下垂慈心，日本皇室如此挺身實行親愛中國民衆的榜賺，這一個事實就是使得　華軍在這次作戰中到處對中國民衆表示仁愛態度的根本原因，所以無論在河南或湖南作戰最重視的是關於中國民衆的事，爲了避免中國民眾受戰禍，日軍作戰行動一部，雖被阻害，然而依然忍受下去。</p>
<p>海野：鄭州一帶</p>
<p>有大小河川三百餘條，以前作戰的時候，拆去民房的門戶架上河上而渡過去，若是渡過三百幾條的河川，不知拆去多少民房的門戶，但是這一次絕對沒有這種事態發生，可見與以前大不組可了。</p>
<p>西島：今天聽各</p>
<p>位從軍記者及　　軍官的談話，我們都知道這次且軍對於佔領地區的中國民眾怎樣的親愛與怎樣的保　，中國農民的生活，這　談話像我們在後方的人聽見也很愉快的，若見中國國民都能諒驟這個事實，那登中日共同擊滅英美的目的必能達到。（完）</p>
<h3>東綫中部德軍採流動防禦戰</h3>
<p>蘇方宣布佔領兩要城</p>
<p>柏林三十日中央社海通社訊：東綫中路日夜有大戰，敵軍所出動之兵力與物資均極雄厚，斯達林以此大軍進攻，其目的顯在奪取白俄羅斯首邑明斯克。蘇軍為欲達此目的，現正自維特勃斯克。莫奇列夫。羅迦契夫。分三路進犯。維特勃斯克與奧爾廈方而受敵軍包　後，德守眾除少數殘餘外，仍獲安然退入主要防地，莫奇列夫及巴勃魯伊斯克四郊德軍現正與占進行爭奪職，德軍採取流動戰略，避離蘇軍之進攻。維特勃斯克奧爾廈間之戰爭，現巳轉移至勒比爾（　　）進南之森林及湖澤地帶，亦即該處之戰爭電心己在貝萊錫那中部與上部。</p>
<p>安加拉三十日中央社電海通社訊，此間獲息：蘇軍當局週四日文吿稱，蘇軍已佔領明斯克東南八十七哩之巴勃魯伊斯克。蘇軍另一文吿稱，蘇軍已佔領貝特洛薩伏資克，即「芬蘭卡萊里亞共和國」都城，位於奧尼迦湖西津，列寗格勒東北三百哩，維堡東北二百哩。</p>
<h3>德軍開抵芬蘭前綫</h3>
<p>柏林三十日中央社電　德外交當局二十九日宣稱：根據德芬兩國協定，更因芬蘭政府之請求，德軍已州始對盟邦實行援助，現該救援部隊開過赫爾辛基後，已配備於卡萊里亞戰棧。</p>
<h3>德國臨存亡關頭　願國民努力奮鬥　郭培爾發表一文</h3>
<p>柏林三十日中央社電海通社訊：德宣傳部長郭培爾近在「德國雜誌」發表一文稱，吾人今日愈益努力，則明日之收穫愈大，故望全緻州人民共為國家努力。敵人今正以全力進攻德國，企圖根本摧毀德國，一舉而解決德國問題。德國一部份國民現正作極大之犧牲，尙有另一部份國民仍可為國努力，今每一德人所應切記者，助從事戰爭乃為保全其生命及國家之存亡，亦即生死戰爭之意義也。每一國民皆應負艱鉅而克盡義務，倘不全力為之，則戰爭更將拖延下去。敵人之物質情形，或優於德國，但吾國人人倘能盡其最大力量，則亦能與之抵銷，尙望全國人民能出座愛國之熱誠，而為國家效忠。</p>

<h3>第六次新敵產　舉行移交式　計本市公用事業六大公司</h3>
<p>第六次新敵產州移交縱式，前日（二十九日）下午四時三十分，在禮查飯店舉行，國府敵產管理委員會駐滬辦事處處長張素民氏，日方宇佐美公使曁陸海軍代表，振興公司關係人員，均出席參加，首由日方代表宇佐美公使致詞，並移交敵產目錄，繼由國府代表張處長致謝詞，做式即吿終了、移交儀式完畢後，並縱續舉行敵產移託管理解任式，宇佐美公使鑿詞後，傳達解任指令書，由肥後海軍中佐代讀陸海眾最高指揮官致詞，最後管理者代表華中水電公司副董事長靑木節致答詞。茲錄中日雙方代表致詞原文如次：</p>
<h3>宇佐美公使詞</h3>
<p>日本政府前曾生民，將在華敵產移交國民政府，嗣即根據此項聲明·逐次將敵產移交，此次以上海電話公司，上海電力公司，滬西電力公司，上海電車公司，上海自來永公司，上海煤氣公司等六家新敵產公司之移交準備事宜，業已吿竣。今受上海方面國海軍最高指揮官委託，將此項敵產移交國民政府。故今日本官以帝國代表資格，以敵產目錄以驕傲貴國政府代表，衷心深感榮幸。敵國政府以敵產移交國府，目的當然在強化歸國政府之政治力，以及期望歸國政府及民眾，利州此項敵產，以貢獻於大東亞戰爭之完成。時懇中曰希望酌國政幟，協力帝國政府之旨，充份善為利用此等移交敵產，尤以此次移交之走業，均屬公用事業性質，比較過去數次移交者不同，其運營之適當與否，於一段民衆福祉頗有影響，故國民政府於接收後，宜努丈妥善加以經營，以裨益於民生之安定，與買獻於大東亞戰爭之完成。</p>
<h3>張處長致謝詞</h3>
<p>今天友邦當局，將六家華中地區之公用事業敵產公司，移交國民政府，本人代表中央當局，致深切謝忱。此次交還之敵產，均馬公用事業，爲對於社會一般民衆有重要關係之企業自交還我國後，當加以謹慎經營，此項敵產在軍管時代，已有顯著成績，今後擬對於經營上，再加用心，俾使上海至公用事業，視盟邦日本之大都是無遜色·今天在此歷史性的移交儀式上，除友邦當局誠意深表謝忱外，病決心努力，以不辜負盟邦當局之期望。</p>
<h3>各方代表致詞</h3>
<p>上海方面陸海軍最高指揮官致詞云：日軍管理中之公用事業關係新敵產六件，今日移交國民政府，上海爲百年來英美　制東亞之最大據點，上海之電力煤氣等公用事業，實為彼等侵略東亞經濟之動脈·自大東亞戰爭發生後，即爲日軍接受，置於軍管理夏，其性各完全一變，完成增強戰力，確保治安之重任。在此時期中，受軍方委託之經營者，能克服一切困難，對於管理聯營當上，盡心竭力，於此表示謝意。此次新敵產移交國府後，國民政府當將比項敵產對各關於中日合辦公司，作為現物出資云。</p>
<p>管理人代表華中水電公司華中水電公司副董事長靑木氏答詞，此次新敵產，根據日本對華新政策之大精神，及調整中日合辦公司之基本方針，移交國民政府，將來國府將以交通敵產，作為對中日合辦公司之現物出資。但當局之意旨，使中日雙方協力營上海公用事業，向完成公用事業之使命邁進，深感今後責任，益為重大，切望中國方面人材協力，實施改組機構，俾求企業之合理化。</p>
<h3>松島部長談　塞班島戰况　登陸美軍損失重大</h3>
<p>盟邦駐華艦隊報道部松島部長，於昨（三十）日下午二時循例會見本巿中國新聞記者團，就本平洋及緬甸歐洲方面作戰情况，發表談話：松島部長言對太平洋戰局情况詳加闡明謂：</p>
<h3>無法進展</h3>
<p>塞班島綫正在猛烈激戰中，敵美妄稱美軍在該島方逐進抵東部之泰保齊山及西部之加拉邦，此項虛偽宣傳，毫無事實根據。蓋一泰保齊山及加拉邦尙在激烈作戰中。泰保齊山日軍在崎嶇高山已築成堅固陣地，居高臨下，以重砲及其他火器詛劍敵軍，其損失之重大，不可言喩，故敵軍實無法進展。加拉邦日軍在郊外對來犯之敵軍勇加殲滅，旦當地日本國民數萬人，不分男女，均一致協助日軍一作戰，所以塞班島方面作戰之日軍，對敵軍已逐步加以撲滅。由戰略上觀之，敵軍遭受空前慘重損失，其作戰可稱為一出血作戰」，日軍作戰則可稱「漸减作戰」。</p>
<h3>敵方狼狽</h3>
<p>又近該島附近海面，敵方已無主丈艦隊綜跡，僅有少數之小型巡洋緻，可見敵方狼狽之竺斑。敵方空軍活動，更不堪言，僅一二架飛機而已。敵軍在塞紙島旣有二師團，實際日軍巧妙戰略以粥魚上钩，對接濟敵軍之敵艦，可一一予以擊滅。敵方太平洋縱隊司令尼米資曾於廿六日對太平洋戰局發表談話稱：美軍在塞班島若物量豐容則可獲勝利，換言之，美眾舟物量，補給如遭斷絕，則美革即不能乍戰，現美職物量補給已發生嚴重問題，比對美軍作戰前途，不言可知。但日軍任可時間主重精神力，隨時可勇敢乍</p>
<h3>虛偽宣傳</h3>
<p>現對敵美虛偽宣傳，再加駁斥，藍敵方宣傳是實，則鑿方軍隊無庸爭奪區區之塞班島，敵軍何不直接進攻日本國土，尤可進攻中國大陸。更可笑者，敵美軍尃家不明近代海戰術，塞班島四周各島之日軍基地航空隊，隨時可出東殲滅艦隊，又日聯合艦隊隨時　謂上動此乃孫子兵法所　謂上之上作戰」敵海軍目與西班牙海戰以後，未遇海戰，　日海眾自日俄海戰後，無日不在訓練中，隨時準備作戰。照塞班島之形勢蘸言，敵軍進攻該島純為失策，而在日機基地重圍中，已深陷日軍作戰計劃。</p>
<h3>緬甸戰况</h3>
<p>繼報告緬甸方面作戰情况稱：因適逢雨季·故無仔何重大進展，但日軍仍在逐步進攻，擊滅美方開闢萊衹公路，由印度經緬甸至昆明，接濟重慶之企圖。最棧對歐洲戰况謂：過去歐洲戰局中心在賺堡，最近英美軍事毫無進展，由英美蘇三國對此戰局關係之微妙，以及蘇聯對戰局不加重視，及不承認開闢第二戰綫，如英美希望蘇聯在東部攻德。惟蘇　並不實行，因此英美蘇三國同盟關係，可稱州同床異夢」或一奏越同舟」，實為非常明顯之事實。</p>
<h3>第一警局司法處　調整機構</h3>
<p>本市第一警察局為促進司法事業，對內部機構予以强化，將針劑寒訊兩科，合併改為偵訊科，科長一職，由前偵緝科科長劉紹奎擔任，並增設烟毒晝緝科，及防犯科，科畏人選亦經發表，烟毒查緝科科長島承諾，防犯科科長石玉祥，上該各科均於今（一）日起正式成立，開始辦公。至於各科各股長人選，日內亦當正式發表。</p>

<p>又該州法處對各分局司法股主任，亦予調整，計老閘分局司法股主任劉俊卿，關任紫熟分局司法股主任，遺缺由前審訊科科長鄧壯金接任，江寗路分局司法股主任尙武，調任華山路分局司法股主任，寨山分局司法股探長黃英保，調任該分局副主任，普陀路分局司法股主任李時中，調任江寗路分局司法股主任，遺缺由楊樹浦分局司法股副主任葉毓泗調任，前偵緝科探長王潤和，調任楊樹浦分局司法股副主任，尙有探目探員，亦有調動，上該各員，均須於今（一）日到局辦公。</p>

<p>「在潛水艇上服務。那很適合的性情。我在江田島時代，曾有過一個「海龜」的綽號，所真人笑著，救開始講「海龜」的意思，以及潛水艇的特性。</p>

<h3>After the Reorganization of the Commercial Control Association</h3>
<p>The National Commercial Control Association has reorganized its structure and personnel. The new chairman, Mr. Wen Lanting, and all directors and supervisors will officially assume their positions today. According to reports, the new and former directors and supervisors of the association held a joint provisional meeting the day before yesterday and mutually elected Lin Kanghou, Yuan Ludeng, Sun Zhongli, Chen Ziyi, and Luo Naqi as executive directors. Lin Kanghou was also appointed as Secretary-General of the Association. In effect, the executive directors of the Commercial Control Association are also the executive directors of the various control committees for rice, cotton, flour and wheat, oil, and daily necessities. In other words, the executive directors of the Commercial Control Association are the highest responsible persons of the various control committees and the actual responsible persons of the Association. This personnel arrangement objectively aligns with the ideal of unified authority.</p>
<p>The Commercial Control Association was established on March 15th of last year. In our editorial on April 14th of last year, on the occasion of the Association's one-month anniversary, we made six expectations for the Association, especially emphasizing the four words "integrity and honesty." We said, "In today's degenerate world, people mistakenly believe that 'control' is a 'way to make money.' This is of course the petty mentality of the general public, but precisely because of this, those in charge should be extra careful, prudent in recruitment, and strict in investigation to set an example. Those who have used control opportunities for personal gain in the past must not be allowed to set foot in the organization to maintain the advantages of refreshing personnel."</p>
<p>This time, the government decided to reorganize the structure, and we also raised four points of hope in our editorial on June 16th. We said, "Personnel issues are the most important issue in any organization. The reason why the various control agencies in the past could not avoid social criticism is largely due to personnel problems. Therefore, the various control agencies should pay special attention to integrity in addition to talent in the future when employing people... We sincerely hope that the industrial and commercial circles will recognize that the current wartime situation is by no means comparable to peacetime. Those who have previously prioritized their own interests should abandon them immediately, and 'reducing self-interest and serving the public' should be the spirit adopted jointly by the authorities and all industries in the future."</p>
<p>We believe that the two paragraphs quoted above are still worth the attention of the General Commercial Association in the future. Today, we again offer the four words "serving the public and abiding by the law" to the Commercial Control Association and its affiliated responsible authorities and all staff. The most unreasonable habit of Chinese people is to only care about private interests and not public interests, to only seek private gain and not abide by the law, and to favor personal connections over legal principles. The lack of law enforcers has led to a lack of law abiders, which has become a widespread phenomenon. Especially in wartime, the general environment is special, and those who violate public interests and the law achieve windfall profits, while those who serve the public and abide by the law lead a difficult life. Therefore, the former regards the latter as being unpromising and useless, and gradually the general social concept also considers illegal profiteering as talented and capable, thus blurring right and wrong. The main reason for the failure of control work in the past lies in this.</p>
<p>Although the Commercial Control Association will now be a comprehensive supervisory and guiding agency, and the various control committees will handle the implementation of control work, the working pace of the various control committees should naturally tend to be consistent, and the personnel selection should naturally tend to be sound. If there is any impropriety, the Commercial Control Association has the absolute responsibility to correct it at any time. As for the current important issues: (1) The cotton cloth purchase work should be concluded as soon as possible, and a special cotton industry management office management committee should be established to be responsible for it. The temporary allocation is chaotic and complex and should be adjusted as soon as possible. (2) The reorganization of the rice control association's structure and personnel adjustment should be realized as soon as possible, especially before the autumn harvest of rice, all methods and procedures for procurement should be reasonably determined and properly arranged as soon as possible. The methods and regulations announced by the Rice Control Association in the past were generally felt to be inconsistent with the actual environment and unreasonable, thus often leading to adverse consequences. (3) Control work values ​​agility in handling affairs and must first take into account the importance of the wartime economy in order to enhance combat effectiveness. Secondly, for legitimate requests, treat everyone equally, regardless of whether they are known or unknown, and handle them quickly in accordance with the prescribed procedures and formalities, and show sympathy for the difficulties of merchants. Moreover, the Commercial Control Association is an organization with the spirit of merchant autonomy and is by no means a bureaucratic organization. It should especially eliminate the sluggish bureaucratic habits. On the day of the inauguration of the new personnel of the Commercial Control Association, we briefly presented our views on the principles as a humble offering.</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Raid Saipan Island at Night, Bombing Enemy Remnant Troops; Enemy Cruisers Heavily Damaged in the Mariana Sea</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Japanese Military Base, 30th - On the 29th, the Japanese Air Force launched a sudden attack on enemy planes cruising in the waters of the Mariana Islands, hitting and heavily damaging a large enemy cruiser with a torpedo. The Japanese planes returned safely to base.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 30th - Pearl Harbor reports that the US Pacific Fleet Command announced on the 29th that Japanese planes bombed enemy troop concentration points on Saipan Island on the evening of the 27th.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 30th - US troops landing on Saipan Island suffered great losses in the longitudinal mountain range and the Garapan city streets. On the 27th, Nimitz Headquarters prohibited the publication of all news about the Saipan battle, which surprised domestic news agencies. On the night of the 28th, American news agencies reported in unison that the resistance of the Japanese troops on Saipan Island had been strengthened. On the same day, the Associated Press Pearl Harbor reported that the resistance of the Japanese garrison on Saipan Island was still fierce, and the advance of the American troops was stopped on the 28th. The San Francisco radio station also broadcast that the battle of Saipan was one of the fierce battles in the Pacific, all acknowledging that the American troops were fighting hard. The Associated Press reported that the US Marines and infantry troops arriving in southern Saipan were divided into four groups due to the fierce attacks of the Japanese troops and were fighting hard.</p>
<h3>The Third War Area Launches an Offensive, Japanese Elite Occupies Quzhou</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 30th - The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on the 30th that Japanese troops in the Shanghai area, in response to the Hunan operation, launched an offensive against the Third War Area troops of Chongqing on the 10th of this month, and captured Quzhou, an important stronghold of the Chongqing troops in that area, on the 26th, and are continuing to fight fiercely. The main results achieved since the start of this operation until the 26th are as follows: 3,591 enemy bodies were recovered, 589 prisoners were captured, and 24 artillery pieces and approximately 900 firearms were seized.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Japanese Military Base on the Zhejiang Front Line, 30th - Japanese aircraft, in order to cover the Japanese ground troops, advanced westward along the old Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Line, hoping to destroy the Chongqing troops in that area, and are constantly actively engaged on the Zhejiang Front Line. On the 24th, they launched a sudden attack on Quzhou, a strategic location of the Chongqing troops in Zhejiang Province, and heavily bombed the Chongqing troops' positions and military facilities, inflicting heavy losses on the Chongqing troops. Another unit of the Japanese army discovered approximately 1,000 Chongqing troops crossing the Qujiang River northwest of Quzhou to rescue Quzhou. Japanese aircraft strafed them with machine guns, causing the corpses of Chongqing troops to be scattered on the Lijiang River (a tributary of the Qujiang River), creating a chaotic situation. The Japanese aircraft safely returned to their original defense after completing their mission.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Japanese Military Base on the Front Line, 30th - The Chongqing military stronghold of Quzhou City in western Zhejiang Province was captured by the Japanese army on the morning of the 26th. Elite Japanese troops, which were advancing along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Line, in order to destroy the enemy troops in the Third War Area, broke through the encirclement formation of the Third War Area under Gu Shitong's command on the Quzhou Plain on the 23rd and launched annihilation battles everywhere. The main force of the Japanese army, under the environment of being attacked from the front and rear, launched an attack operation on Quzhou City with strategically rare tactics. Each unit aimed for the dawn of the 20th and rushed to the southeast corner and east gate of the enemy city. In addition, the Japanese Air Force also coordinated with the elite troops on the ground and launched fierce bombing. At 5:00 AM, they broke into the south gate from the southeast corner of the city and immediately launched a street battle, forcing the enemy to retreat to the northwest corner of the city, and then completely annihilated them. At 7:00 AM, the entire city was occupied. Currently, the Japanese army is carrying out mopping-up operations in the vicinity of the city to expand the results of the battle.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Japanese Military Base on the Front Line, 30th - Quzhou has fallen. The following is a description of the process of its fall: The main force of the Chongqing army and a part of the 145th Division were in Quzhou County. On the 21st of this month, the 49th Army was stationed there, and enemy aircraft harassed the rear of the Japanese army. In addition to the field army, the Japanese army also used a part of its powerful troops to attack Quzhou from the north and south. On the 19th, they secretly advanced and arrived near the county seat. After launching a fierce battle on the front of Quzhou, the Chongqing army mistakenly believed that it had surrounded the Japanese army and did not realize the Japanese ambush. After the Japanese army defeated most of the Chongqing army, it used a part of its troops to monitor the enemy southwest of Quzhou and urgently mobilized its main force to move to the front of Quzhou. From the 25th to the 26th, they took advantage of the enemy's weakness and launched a surprise attack. At this time, the morale of the Chongqing army was quite strong, and the military ships in the river west of the city were moved to the opposite bank, forming a defensive formation with their backs to the river. However, contact within the city was cut off, and they were not even aware of the whereabouts of the main force of the Japanese army. On the 25th, Japanese aircraft scattered surrender leaflets over the city, and the Chongqing army mistakenly believed that the Japanese offensive power had weakened. Under these circumstances, the Japanese army advanced to the outside of the city under the cover of darkness and launched a simultaneous attack when it was barely light. The air force also dropped bombs from the air to assist the ground troops, completely annihilating more than 2,000 Chongqing troops. The capture of Quzhou this time can be said to be a surprise annihilation battle.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting in the Suburbs of Hengyang</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Japanese Military Base in Hunan, 30th - Japanese troops in Hunan, advancing south along the Yuehan Railway Line, captured the Hengyang Airport on the east bank of the Xiangjiang River on the dawn of the 26th, from three sides, and the powerful base of the Chongqing-American Air Force fell into the hands of the Japanese army. Another unit of the Japanese army advanced south on the west bank of the Xiangjiang River and also surrounded Hengyang City, opposite the Hengyang Airport, from the north, west, and south. The main force of the Chongqing Reserve 10th Division and the 196th Division in the city relied on their bunkers and hidden gun emplacements to put up a stubborn resistance. Therefore, fierce fighting is currently underway in that area.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 30th - According to a Chongqing report, the Chongqing military authorities announced the Hengyang battle situation on the night of the 29th as follows: The Hengyang offensive and defensive battle has become even more fierce. The Japanese army is approaching the outer perimeter of Hengyang and has increased its troop strength and a large number of light and heavy weapons. On the night of the 27th, they launched a full-scale attack on the Chongqing army's positions and engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the Chongqing army's garrison until the night of the 20th, and fierce fighting was still underway. Moreover, Hengyang is currently in the hands of the Chongqing army.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 30th - According to a Chongqing report, the Chongqing military authorities announced on the 27th that fierce fighting continued in the northeast area of Hengyang. The area between the Sanmei River and the Xiangjiang River east of Hengyang was in fierce battle all day on the 26th, and both sides suffered casualties. The battle lasted until night. According to reports, after the Japanese army occupied Hengshan on the Xiang-Gan Railway Line, they divided their forces into several teams and went south, attempting to jointly attack Hengyang. The Chongqing army intercepted them at a location 20 kilometers northwest of Hengyang. Although Hengyang City has become the center of the war, the city is still as calm as ever. According to the Associated Press Chongqing correspondent, the Chongqing military authorities said that the Japanese army's attempt to encircle Hengyang from the east may be to cut off the Yuehan Railway Line on the direct side of Hengyang. The Japanese army is now advancing to Ren'an.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 30th - According to the Associated Press correspondent in Chongqing, the situation in Hunan is as follows: The Chongqing military authorities announced that a unit of the Japanese army has occupied the eastern suburbs of Hengyang City, three kilometers away, and other Japanese army units are pressing hard from the north and northwest and have now arrived at a location eight kilometers away from Hengyang. The Japanese army attacking the south of Hengyang has cut off the Yuehan Railway Line at a location nine and a half kilometers south of the city. The Japanese army in the west is cutting off the Xiang-Gui Railway (between Hengyang and Guilin) at Xitang, 20 kilometers away from Hengyang. The Japanese troops advancing to Sitang are attacking other locations on the Xiang-Gui Railway Line from Xiangxiang.</p>
<h3>People's Hearts Wavering in Guilin and Other Places</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 30th - As the Southwest War situation is gradually unfolding, the turmoil in the southwest region of Chongqing is also intensifying as a result. According to an Associated Press report from Chongqing, Guilin, the capital of Guangxi Province, has felt the threat of a Japanese offensive. Banks have closed one after another, and pawnshops have fled to the interior one after another. The wavering of the people's hearts has fallen into an unmanageable state. Li Jishen, director of the Guilin Office of the Chongqing Military Commission, even broadcast that the six southwestern provinces are the most densely populated and fertile areas in the country. A quarter of China's 400 million people live here. The leaders of China's modern revolution were all born here. The essence of the Chinese nation is concentrated here. The people of the abundant six provinces should not flee, but stay here. Those who evade danger are criminals who destroy the people's awareness of resistance.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Troops in Shaoguan Attempt to Breach the Beijiang River</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 30th - After the Japanese troops in Hunan attacked Changsha, they continued to advance south and recently captured the Hengyang Airport and surrounded Hengyang City, causing the Chongqing troops to be extremely embarrassed. The Chongqing military authorities in Shaoguan are also trembling with fear and spreading rumors, expanding the use of the flood season to breach the Beijiang River dam, attempting to hinder the development of the peaceful area. It was found that during the Hunan operation five years ago, the Chongqing army once breached the Yellow River levee in an attempt to hinder the Japanese army's actions, but the result had no effect on the Japanese army's operations. The sufferers were the people in the vicinity, and now the Chongqing army is attempting to breach the Beijiang River again, which will only put the people of Guangdong Province in misery.</p>
<h3>Under This Major Situation, Japan and Germany Decide to Closely Cooperate: Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Meets with Reporters to Talk</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 30th - Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu met with reporters from the Allied News Agency on the afternoon of the 30th and spoke about the relationship between Japan and Germany, saying: German Ambassador to Japan Stahmer paid a visit to Prime Minister Tojo on the 28th and held talks for about three hours. I also participated. Our Ambassador to Germany, Oshima, has repeatedly visited Führer Hitler and exchanged responsible opinions. This time, the German Ambassador in Tokyo visited Prime Minister Tojo, which has been realized. Prime Minister Tojo spread out a map and explained the current war in detail. Ambassador Stahmer also stated the current military and political situation in Germany. Japan and Germany, under this major international situation, have such opinions, which can express the determination of Japan and Germany to closely cooperate and complete the holy war. The meeting between the Prime Minister and the German Ambassador is scheduled to be held in the future.</p>
<h3>County Administrative Organization Reform Plan Approved by the Supreme National Defense Council</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th - In order to further adapt to the decisive battle system and strengthen administrative efficiency, the authorities have repeatedly reformed the centralization of power and the simplification of institutions in local administration, which has been quite effective in strengthening administrative efficiency. The reform plan for the county administrative organization was previously passed by the 213th regular meeting of the Executive Yuan and was presented to the 50th Supreme National Defense Council for approval. The plan has made epoch-making improvements and enhancements to the unification of county administration, the strengthening of the status and treatment of county magistrates and county assistants, the unification of county finances, the strengthening of township and bao institutions, and the organization of baojia. In particular, the document system of the county has been clearly stipulated, and the foundation of county finance has been established. The implementation of this plan will bring about an epoch-making leap forward in the penetration of the National Government's local political power. The plan is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Unification and Strengthening of County Administration (A) The power of the county is completely concentrated in the county magistrate. The county magistrate only receives orders from the provincial government and the administrative inspector's office. Other agencies must not issue orders to the county government. However, senior military agencies (such as the pacification director's office and the garrison headquarters, etc. should be stipulated separately). (B) The county government should be based on the principle of setting up departments to handle affairs, and the regulations for setting up bureaus should be strict. For those who must set up bureaus (police bureau), the director should be absolutely under the command and supervision of the county magistrate. The appointment of the director should be recommended by the county magistrate. (C) The number of staff in the county government should be increased according to actual needs. (1) The county government should set up two to three secretaries to handle daily affairs under the order of the county magistrate. (2) The county government's field staff should account for at least two-tenths in order to promote the work of various districts, townships, and towns. (3) The positions concurrently held by the county magistrate should be merged into the county government and handled by the department, or concurrently handled by the relevant department, based on the principle of not establishing sporadic institutions. (D): The county government should set up district offices in districts, and the principles are as follows: (1) The division of districts is temporarily based on the current autonomous regions. (2) The district office is regarded as the office of the county government, and its functions are to promote the autonomous work of townships and towns and handle affairs within the jurisdiction independently according to the orders of the county government. (E) The county government should formulate central work, based on the four standards of time, manpower, and financial resources, which should be formulated by the county and approved by the province for effective implementation. The provincial government should take this as the county magistrate's performance evaluation.</p>
<p>(2) Improving the Status and Treatment of County Magistrates and County Assistants, (A) The county magistrate should be a senior or recommended appointment, and the county government secretary, bureau chief, department chief, and district chief should be a recommended appointment or delegated appointment. (B) The above official ranks should be based on the level of the county district and the qualifications of the individual. (C) Establish a county personnel system. (1) The county magistrate should be examined, identified, and trained by the central government to create a candidate list for county magistrates and distribute them to various provinces. The designation of an acting county magistrate and the presentation of a request for a senior or recommended county magistrate should be limited to the personnel on the list. (2) The county bureau chief, department chief, district chief, and other assistants should be examined, screened, and trained by the provincial government to create a candidate list for county assistants and distribute them to various counties. The designation of an acting county assistant and the presentation of a request for a recommended county assistant should be limited to the personnel on the list. (3) County assistants who are appointed by the provincial government in accordance with the above do not advance or retreat with the county magistrate. (4) The provincial governor has the right to state reasons and choose another person at any time for the county magistrate, and the county magistrate has the right to state reasons and choose another person at any time for his subordinates. (D) The salary of the county magistrate and county assistants should be increased as much as possible, and the county magistrate should have sufficient special office expenses.</p>
<p>(3) Unifying and Enriching County Finance (A) County finance should be independent, and county taxes and provincial taxes should have a reasonable division, and must be approved by the central government. (B) Of the income from taxes (including all surtaxes), 60% to 80% should be county income. (C) The county's expenditure should be notified by the county magistrate to allocate the budget, and the provincial government should approve it with reference to its central work plan. The provincial government should compile the budgets of each county separately and report them to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Finance for record. (D) The provincial government must not extract county funds for provincial use, nor may it designate certain income for special purposes.

<h3>Third Anniversary of the Rural Pacification Campaign: Premier of the Executive Yuan's Letter to Comrades: Cooperate to Strive for the Permanent Security of Greater East Asia</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report: For the third anniversary of the Rural Pacification Campaign, the Premier of the Executive Yuan respectfully addressed a letter to the comrades in the Rural Pacification work and compatriots from all walks of life, saying:</p>
<p>The Rural Pacification work began in July of the 30th year, and was presided over by the Rural Pacification Committee established by the National Government. In May of last year, the central government decided to dissolve the Rural Pacification Committee and transfer its powers to the Executive Yuan, thereby simplifying the organization and making progress more active. In the past three years, witnessing the unremitting struggle of the comrades in the Rural Pacification work and the unity of the compatriots from all walks of life in the Rural Pacification areas, the entire Rural Pacification plan has been implemented step by step, which is truly admirable, and the various cooperation from the allied countries has made the Rural Pacification work progress smoothly, which is deeply appreciated. Taking advantage of this anniversary of the Rural Pacification Campaign, I would like to briefly state my thoughts to my comrades in the Rural Pacification work and the people from all walks of life:</p>
<p>First, we should seek unlimited development with a non-complacent attitude. Complacency is the evil cause of failure. The main purposes of the Rural Pacification work are: first, to correct ideology; second, to eliminate bandits and communists; third, to ensure social order; and fourth, to increase production. Although this kind of work has been successful in the past three years, it is not allowed to be complacent. Correcting ideology focuses on depth; eliminating bandits and communists focuses on thoroughness; ensuring social order focuses on strength; and increasing production focuses on density. How to eradicate feudal consciousness and Anglo-American thoughts; how to prevent the recurrence of bandits coming and going after bandits are eliminated; how to enable the people in various places to have the ability to self-govern and self-defend; how to enable compatriots to live and work in peace, and rural areas to have abundant harvests; the smooth exchange of materials between urban and rural areas; there are many things that need to be worked hard on in the future, and we can only move forward if we want to seek unlimited development in the future.</p>
<h3>Never Compromise</h3>
<p>Second, we should fight against evil and corrupt forces with a non-compromising spirit. Compromise is a poisonous vegetable that hinders the revolution. The Chongqing puppet bandits and communists, who are harming the country and the people, must be thoroughly eliminated, which goes without saying. In addition, bad troops, unworthy officials, and illegal merchants, who only extort and exploit, engage in fraud for personal gain, and hoard and speculate, using the blood and sweat of agricultural and industrial producers to fatten their pockets, are all thieves who harm the people's livelihood. They are also the enemies of the Rural Pacification work comrades and the people from all walks of life. They must be crushed and eliminated, and there must be no compromise. If they are allowed to be a scourge, it will only lead to regret in the future. If this is the case, then even if the evil and corrupt forces have many tricks and tricks, they will eventually be defeated and destroyed.</p>
<h3>Unceasing Effort</h3>
<p>Third, we must have the determination not to be discouraged and make unceasing efforts. Self-discouragement is a bad habit of defeatists. The pacification campaign is not only limited to weaving security in one province or one county, but also bears the mission of a new era. What is the mission of the new era? It is to revive China and defend East Asia. Since the mission is so important, the arduousness of the task is self-evident. However, if we can grasp the correct path and make unremitting efforts to overcome the obstacles on the way, then everything in the course and environment will not be obstacles to us. The significance of the pacification campaign lies in guaranteeing peace and expanding peace. It aims to eradicate Anglo-American opium and restore China and East Asia. From a domestic perspective, it is to revive China and lay an unshakable foundation. From a foreign perspective, it is to cooperate in completing the Greater East Asia War and achieve permanent security in East Asia. Therefore, every achievement of the pacification campaign brings the mission of the new era one step closer to completion. Our responsibility lies in seeking gradual progress through persistent efforts. If we can make efforts, we will surely make progress. If there is progress, there will be achievements. Everything else is not worth considering. As the fourth year of the pacification campaign begins, it is a new and decisive stage in the Greater East Asia War and even the world war. As fierce battles unfold and victory is in sight, this is the most difficult time. Our survival and security depend on it. We must have the determination not to be discouraged and make unceasing efforts, so that the past efforts can be completed with the final and most difficult struggle. Saving China and protecting East Asia, this is the way.</p>
<p>The above three points have been stated many times before, but today they seem even more urgent. I do not hesitate to repeat them, and I hope we can encourage each other.</p>
<h3>Governor Su Chen Issues Statement</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Suzhou, 30th – July 1st is the third anniversary of the pacification campaign. This reporter recently visited Governor Chen to inquire about his thoughts. He kindly issued the following statement: "Regarding the importance of the pacification campaign, I would like to tell my fellow compatriots my personal thoughts: I recall that in the 30th year of the Republic [1941], the Pacification Committee of the National Government established a military office in Jiangsu. At that time, I was the Minister of War and Interior and was ordered to represent the central government in assisting with the supervision. Later, I also came to Jiangsu to inspect the party affairs work in the pacification zone. I deeply felt that before and after the pacification campaign, Jiangsu Province had made significant progress in people's livelihood and security. It was not only the efforts and dedication of the authorities, but also the guidance and assistance of the compatriots and the unity and support of the people that made it possible. Now, I am responsible for the political affairs, and all administrative matters are inevitably difficult, but it is also due to human effort. Now, I can only do my best, but it is still far from ideal. This is not only a matter of shame in my heart. The pacification campaign and provincial administration are even more integrated and inseparable. The Greater East Asia War has now entered a decisive stage, and the promotion of the pacification campaign brooks no delay. We are particularly inspired by the spirit of unity, hard work, and perseverance of the Allied nations in striving for victory. Today, we should be more proactive, strive harder, and complete the pacification mission to fulfill China's commitment to participate in the war, and faithfully follow Chairman Wang's instructions to share weal and woe, and live and die together with the Allied nations, to complete the revival of China and the construction of East Asia. All officials and people of Jiangsu Province should carry out their duties diligently in their respective positions. I offer these three points to encourage my fellow compatriots."</p>
<h3>Japanese Contributors to Savings Recognized by Government</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 30th – Since the start of the Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese national savings campaign has exceeded the huge sum of 100 billion yen by March of this year. To encourage savings, the Japanese government specifically announced the names of those recognized on the 29th. According to reports, the Japanese people's savings campaign began in the early Meiji era. Before the Sino-Japanese War, the total savings in the 70 years reached 44.6 billion yen. However, from the start of the war to March of this year, the period was only six years and nine months, about one-tenth of the former, but the increase in savings reached more than 100 billion yen, about twice as much as the former. This time, 35 groups and 25 individuals were recognized by the Prime Minister, 285 groups and 234 individuals were recognized by the Minister of Finance, and 1,095 groups and 904 individuals were recognized by the National Savings Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, totaling 2,578 cases.</p>
<h3>Enemy Forces Besiege Caen, Tank Battle Unfolds</h3>
<p>Rommel Ordered to Transfer Reinforcements to the Front</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Supreme Headquarters of Marshal Montgomery, 30th – Reuters war correspondent Bo reports: The fierce tank battle between German and British forces southwest of Caen continued unabated yesterday. The British offensive against the city was halted by a German counterattack on the Caen-Viller Bocage line. However, the British are poised to attempt another attack on Caen from the southwest. According to informed sources, the German counterattack southwest of Caen was the most powerful operation by German tank forces. The British attempted to defend their narrow positions with the help of Avenger anti-tank guns. However, German Tiger and Panther tanks broke into the center of the British lines, destroying their defensive tank fortifications. In the past twelve hours, the Germans destroyed more than twenty British defensive tank fortifications. The British used Savoy cannons for the first time on the Caen front.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 30th – Reuters reports: General Rommel has transferred reinforcements to the Northern France theater in preparation for an emergency. The armored forces are commanded by General Heinrich Eberbach. Eberbach was formerly the military attaché at the German embassy in London. General Hans Speidel is also in the Northern France theater.</p>
<h3>Allied Ships Shell Cherbourg Harbor</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 30th – A naval correspondent for the German News Agency reported that Allied landing craft entered Cherbourg harbor last night, but heavy warships were prevented from approaching by German artillery.</p>
<h3>German Predictions of New Landing Sites</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin – Reuters reports: Major General Goettau, a military commentator for the Berliner Börsen-Zeitung, said that the Allied forces may use Sardinia and Corsica as bases for a second landing in the Mediterranean region. However, the mountainous west coast of Italy is not conducive to airborne troops, and a landing in northern Italy is more convenient. The German army is prepared. The Montpelier area in southern France is also suitable for landing.</p>
<h3>French Cabinet Holds Emergency Meeting in Paris</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Paris, 30th – The French government held an emergency cabinet meeting here yesterday morning, presided over by Prime Minister Laval. All cabinet members and officials attended to discuss various policies.</p>
<h3>Roundtable Discussion with Japanese Press Corps at Military Headquarters</h3>
<p>Farmers Express Gratitude</p>
<p>Oshima: I departed from a certain place by plane on the 21st and passed over Yuezhou. Because the plane was flying very low, the ground conditions were clearly visible. I saw many Chinese people working with the Japanese army. I heard that they voluntarily came out to help the Japanese army. Now is the time when peaches and apricots are ripe in the Hunan area. Everywhere we passed, peaches and apricots were abundant. Local farmers picked these fruits and sent them to Japanese soldiers, so we are also grateful to the Chinese people. In the past, there were rumors that the Japanese army committed atrocities in the occupied areas, so this time, the North China Front issued the Three Nos policy, which is "No burning, no violation, no killing." This order was thoroughly conveyed to every soldier, so no matter where they are stationed, military discipline is strict and orderly. Therefore, after the fall of Zhengzhou, within four or five days, the number of returning residents reached two to three thousand every day, and now it has completely returned to its original state. The military vehicles used by the Japanese army also hire Chinese drivers, and their treatment is exactly the same as that of soldiers, without any distinction.</p>
<p>Nishijima: Since the Japanese army has so carefully considered the safety of the Chinese people and their property, its actions must be subject to considerable restrictions. Will this not affect the combat operations?</p>
<p>Umino: If there are fields or other agricultural products in the front where the unit is conducting operations, regardless of the disadvantages to the operation, it will detour elsewhere to avoid damaging the villages. The unit is willing to accept a 2% loss in combat effectiveness due to taking such detours, and will certainly work harder in combat to compensate for this 2% loss.</p>
<p>Nishijima: Has the message from the Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army in Henan, the "Message to the Soldiers of the Japanese Army," been thoroughly conveyed to every soldier?</p>
<p>Umino: Most of it has been thoroughly conveyed, but there is still a small portion who do not know.</p>
<h3>Proclamation of the Japanese Army</h3>
<p>Nishijima: There is also the proclamation of the Japanese Army Commander to the Chinese people. May I ask the military officer to express some opinions.</p>
<p>Military Officer: Any war should have a righteous cause. If this point is not clear, the war will continue for a long time, and it will inevitably lose its tension. From the China Incident until the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the righteous cause of the war was clearly revealed. Until the time of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese Expeditionary Force was conducting the war under various adverse conditions. However, this time the operation is very different. If we look at the fundamental spirit of the Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China, we will understand it even more clearly. If we look at the "Message to the Soldiers of the Japanese Army" issued by the Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army this time, we will understand its spirit.</p>
<p>(The military officer then presented the "Message to the Soldiers of the Japanese Army" and the proclamation to the Chinese people. The "Message to the Soldiers of the Japanese Army" roughly stated:</p>
<p>"The purpose of this operation is to destroy the United Kingdom and the United States and to strike at the anti-Japanese regime in Chongqing, which is willing to be a running dog of the United Kingdom and the United States, and to save the Chinese people from the scourge of war. Soldiers on the front line should treat the Chinese people with the greatest compassion, and all actions should be worthy of heaven and earth.</p>
<p>It is forbidden to harm or commit violence against the Chinese people. It is forbidden to burn down residents' houses. Unless there is official business, it is forbidden to enter the homes of ordinary people at will, and it is forbidden to loot or destroy furniture. All purchases of Chinese goods must be paid for. It is forbidden to forcibly recruit laborers. When hiring Chinese coolies, the necessary procedures must be carried out, and Chinese people should be asked to introduce the coolies. All hired coolies must be paid wages."</p>
<p>Another proclamation was to the Chinese people, the text of which is as follows:</p>
<p>"For the purpose of proclamation, the purpose of the Japanese army's attack and stationing in this area is to break the traditional ambition of the United Kingdom and the United States to sacrifice China and invade East Asia, to assist China in establishing sovereignty and achieving freedom, and to promote the promotion and realization of friendly relations between China and Japan. The righteous army is invincible and will defeat the United Kingdom and the United States and its vassals, and implement the policy of protecting the territory and the people. Residents are requested to live and work in peace and contentment, and do not believe in rumors and disturb each other. The following points should be made known to all, so that the great righteousness of our army may be understood: The Japanese army will temporarily station troops until the complete realization of the protection of the territory and the people. The Japanese army solemnly guarantees the lives, property, and all other natural and human rights of the people in the garrison area. There will be no collection of taxes or conscription of soldiers in the Japanese army's garrison area. All people in the area who cooperate with our army in providing materials or labor will be paid full compensation. The Japanese army recognizes the current new currency and the Central Reserve Certificates in circulation at the same time. The Japanese army respects rural customs and assists the people in implementing the system of self-government, but the military administration will be temporarily implemented until the security is determined." A certain official continued to speak and said:</p>
<p>We know from these two documents that the war consciousness of this attack on Changsha does not lie in the three previous captures of Changsha, but in the war to destroy the United Kingdom and the United States. When soldiers on the front line see American planes such as the (B24) type, they cannot help but gnash their teeth, and the Japanese army believes that the Chongqing army in front of them are brothers, because their leaders have gone the wrong way and driven them to the battlefield. This war is indeed a war with a great righteous cause. Another thing I want to tell you is that His Imperial Highness Prince Mikasa of Japan has served in important positions in the Chinese army from January of the year before last to January of this year. He often taught his staff members, "The fundamental purpose of the Japanese Expeditionary Force to China is to enable the 400 million Chinese people to live and work in peace and contentment, and to enable China to realize unification and establish a modern country as soon as possible." When His Imperial Highness Mikasa inspects various places, he often approaches the Chinese people when there is an opportunity, and shows compassion. The Japanese Imperial Family takes the lead in practicing the example of loving the Chinese people, and this fact is the fundamental reason why the Chinese army everywhere shows an attitude of benevolence and love towards the Chinese people in this operation. Therefore, whether in Henan or Hunan, the most important thing is the affairs of the Chinese people. In order to avoid the Chinese people suffering from the scourge of war, although a part of the Japanese army's operations is hindered, it is still endured.</p>
<p>Umino: The Zhengzhou area</p>
<p>There are more than 300 large and small rivers. In previous operations, the doors of the people's houses were dismantled and erected on the river to cross over. If we crossed over 300 rivers, I don't know how many doors of the people's houses would be dismantled. But this time, such a situation will never happen. It can be seen that it is very different from before.</p>
<p>Nishijima: Today, listening to the discussions of the reporters and military officers who went to the army, we all know how kind and protective the Japanese army is to the Chinese people in the occupied areas, and it is also very pleasant for us people in the rear to hear about the lives of Chinese farmers. If the Chinese people can all understand this fact, then the goal of China and Japan jointly destroying the United Kingdom and the United States will surely be achieved. (End)</p>
<h3>German Army Adopts Mobile Defense in Central Eastern Front</h3>
<p>Soviet Forces Announce Capture of Two Important Cities</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 30th – Reuters reports: There are fierce battles day and night in the central part of the Eastern Front. The enemy's deployed forces and materials are very large. Stalin's purpose in attacking with this large army is obviously to seize Minsk, the capital of Belarus. In order to achieve this goal, the Soviet army is now advancing from Vitebsk, Mogilev, and Rogachev in three directions. After being encircled by the enemy from the direction of Vitebsk and Orsha, the German defenders, except for a few remnants, were safely able to retreat into the main defensive positions. The German army is currently fighting for control of the outskirts of Mogilev and Bobruisk. The German army is adopting a mobile strategy to avoid the Soviet offensive. The battle between Vitebsk and Orsha has now shifted to the forests and lakes south of Lepel, that is, the center of the battle is now in the central and upper reaches of the Berezina.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Ankara, 30th – Reuters reports that it is learned here that the Soviet authorities stated in a document on Thursday that the Soviet army had captured Bobruisk, 87 miles southeast of Minsk. Another Soviet document stated that the Soviet army had captured Petrozavodsk, the capital of the "Finnish Karelia Republic," located west of Lake Onega, 300 miles northeast of Leningrad, and 200 miles northeast of Vyborg.</p>
<h3>German Troops Arrive at Finnish Front</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 30th – The German Foreign Ministry announced on the 29th that, according to the German-Finnish agreement and at the request of the Finnish government, the German army has begun to provide assistance to the Allied nations. The rescue force has passed through Helsinki and is now deployed on the Karelian front.</p>
<h3>Germany is at a Critical Juncture, Hoping the People Will Strive Hard – Goebbels Publishes an Article</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 30th – Reuters reports: German Propaganda Minister Goebbels recently published an article in the "Germany Magazine" stating that the more we work hard today, the greater the harvest will be tomorrow. Therefore, I hope that all people in the province will work hard for the country. The enemy is now attacking Germany with all its strength, attempting to fundamentally destroy Germany and solve the German problem in one fell swoop. A part of the German people is now making great sacrifices, and another part of the people can still work hard for the country. Every German should remember that helping in the war is to preserve his life and the survival of the country, which is the meaning of a war of life and death. Every citizen should bear difficult responsibilities and fulfill their obligations. If we do not do our best, the war will be prolonged. The enemy's material situation may be better than Germany's, but if everyone in our country can do their best, we can also offset it. I hope that the people of the whole country can show their patriotism and be loyal to the country.</p>

<h3>Sixth New Enemy Assets Transfer Ceremony Held, Including Six Major Public Utility Companies in the City</h3>
<p>The transfer ceremony of the sixth batch of new enemy assets was held at the Astor House Hotel at 4:30 pm the day before yesterday (the 29th). Mr. Zhang Sumin, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Enemy Assets Management Committee of the National Government, Japanese Minister Usami, representatives of the Army and Navy, and personnel from the Zhenxing Company attended. First, Japanese representative Minister Usami delivered a speech and handed over the list of enemy assets. Then, Director Zhang, the representative of the National Government, gave a thank-you speech, and the ceremony ended. After the transfer ceremony, the ceremony for the release of the entrustment management of enemy assets was continued. After Minister Usami's speech, he conveyed the release instruction. Lieutenant Commander Higo of the Navy read the speech of the Supreme Commander of the Army and Navy. Finally, Aoki Setsu, Vice Chairman of the Huazhong Water and Electricity Company and representative of the managers, gave a reply. The original texts of the speeches of the Chinese and Japanese representatives are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Speech by Minister Usami</h3>
<p>The Japanese government previously issued a statement to the people that it would transfer enemy assets in China to the National Government. Since then, based on this statement, the enemy assets have been transferred step by step. This time, the preparations for the transfer of six new enemy assets companies, including Shanghai Telephone Company, Shanghai Electric Power Company, Huxi Electric Power Company, Shanghai Tram Company, Shanghai Water Company, and Shanghai Gas Company, have been completed. Today, entrusted by the Supreme Commander of the Army and Navy in Shanghai, I will transfer these enemy assets to the National Government. Therefore, today, as a representative of the Empire, I am very honored to hand over the list of enemy assets to the representative of your government. The purpose of the enemy government in transferring enemy assets to the National Government is, of course, to strengthen the political power of the returning government, and to hope that the returning government and the people will benefit from these enemy assets and contribute to the completion of the Greater East Asia War. I sincerely hope that China will consider the purpose of Japan's policies and cooperate with the Empire's government to make full use of these transferred enemy assets. In particular, the industries transferred this time are all public utilities, which are different from the previous transfers. Whether their operation is appropriate or not has a great impact on the well-being of the people. Therefore, after the National Government takes over, it should strive to manage them properly, so as to contribute to the stability of people's livelihood and the completion of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<h3>Thank-you Speech by Director Zhang</h3>
<p>Today, the friendly authorities are transferring six public utility enemy assets companies in the Huazhong area to the National Government. On behalf of the Central Authorities, I express my sincere gratitude. The enemy assets handed over this time are all public utilities, which are enterprises that have an important relationship with the general public. After being handed over to our country, they should be carefully managed. These enemy assets have already achieved remarkable results during the military control era. In the future, we plan to put more effort into the management, so that the public utilities in Shanghai will be no less inferior than the major cities of our ally, Japan. Today, at this historic transfer ceremony, in addition to expressing my sincere gratitude to the friendly authorities, I am also determined to work hard so as not to disappoint the expectations of the allied authorities.</p>
<h3>Speeches by Representatives from Various Parties</h3>
<p>The Supreme Commander of the Army and Navy in Shanghai said: The six new enemy assets related to public utilities under the management of the Japanese army are transferred to the National Government today. Shanghai has been the largest base for the United Kingdom and the United States to control East Asia for a hundred years. Public utilities such as electricity and gas in Shanghai are actually the arteries of their economic aggression in East Asia. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, they have been taken over by the Japanese army and placed under military management, and their nature has completely changed, completing the important task of enhancing combat power and ensuring security. During this period, the managers entrusted by the military have been able to overcome all difficulties and have devoted themselves to management and joint operations, and I express my gratitude for this. After the new enemy assets are transferred to the National Government, the National Government will contribute these enemy assets to the Sino-Japanese joint venture companies as in-kind investment.</p>
<p>Aoki, Vice Chairman of the Huazhong Water and Electricity Company and representative of the managers, replied that this time the new enemy assets are transferred to the National Government based on the great spirit of Japan's new policy towards China and the basic principles of adjusting Sino-Japanese joint venture companies, and in the future, the National Government will use the transportation enemy assets as in-kind investment in the Sino-Japanese joint venture companies. However, the intention of the authorities is to enable China and Japan to cooperate in operating Shanghai's public utilities and to move towards the mission of completing public utilities. I feel that the responsibility in the future will be even greater, and I sincerely hope that Chinese talents will cooperate to implement the reorganization of the organization in order to rationalize the enterprise.</p>
<h3>Minister Matsushima Discusses the Situation on Saipan Island - Landing US Forces Suffer Heavy Losses</h3>
<p>Minister Matsushima of the Allied Forces in China Reporting Department met with the Shanghai Chinese press corps as usual yesterday (30th) afternoon to discuss the war situation in the Pacific, Burma, and Europe. Minister Matsushima gave a detailed explanation of the situation in the Pacific theater, saying:</p>
<h3>Unable to Advance</h3>
<p>The Saipan Island line is in the midst of a fierce battle. The enemy Americans falsely claimed that the American army had gradually advanced to Mount Tapochau in the east and Garapan in the west of the island. This false propaganda has no factual basis. Mount Tapochau and Garapan are still in fierce fighting. The Japanese army on Mount Tapochau has built solid positions in the rugged high mountains, commanding a view from above, and cursing at the enemy army with heavy artillery and other firearms. The heavy losses of the enemy army are beyond words, so the enemy army is really unable to advance. In Garapan, the Japanese army is bravely annihilating the invading enemy army in the suburbs. However, tens of thousands of local Japanese people, regardless of gender, are unanimously assisting the Japanese army in fighting, so the Japanese army fighting on Saipan Island has gradually wiped out the enemy army. From a strategic point of view, the enemy army has suffered unprecedented heavy losses, and its operations can be called a "bleeding operation," while the Japanese army's operations can be called a "gradual reduction operation."</p>
<h3>Enemy in Disarray</h3>
<p>Also, near the sea near the island, the enemy has no trace of the main fleet, only a few small cruisers, which shows that the enemy is in a panic. The enemy's air force activity is even worse, with only one or two planes. The enemy army has two divisions on Saipan Island. In fact, the Japanese army's clever strategy is to lure the enemy fish to take the bait, and the enemy ships supplying the enemy army can be destroyed one by one. Nimitz, the commander of the enemy's Pacific column, said on the 26th in a statement on the Pacific war situation that the US army can win on Saipan Island if the supplies are abundant. In other words, if the US army's supplies are cut off, then the US army will not be able to fight. Now the US army's supplies have a serious problem, which is self-evident for the future of the US army's operations. However, the Japanese army is always able to maintain its fighting spirit and can be brave at any time.</p>
<h3>False Propaganda</h3>
<p>Now, I will refute the enemy Americans' false propaganda again. If the enemy's propaganda is true, then the enemy army will not need to fight for the mere Saipan Island. Why does the enemy army not directly attack the Japanese mainland, and can even attack the Chinese mainland? What is even more ridiculous is that the enemy's American experts do not understand modern naval tactics. The Japanese army base air force on the islands around Saipan Island can destroy the fleet at any time, and the Japanese combined fleet is always ready to move. This is what Sun Tzu's Art of War calls the "superior strategy." The enemy navy has not encountered a naval battle since the Spanish-American War. The Japanese navy has been training at any time since the Russo-Japanese Naval Battle, and is always ready for battle. According to the situation on Saipan Island, it is purely a miscalculation for the enemy army to attack the island, and in the Japanese air base encirclement, it has deeply fallen into the Japanese army's operational plan.</p>
<h3>Burma War Situation</h3>
<p>Following the report on the Burmese war situation, it stated: Due to the rainy season, there has been no significant progress. However, the Japanese army is still gradually advancing, aiming to thwart the American attempt to open the Ledo Road from India through Burma to Kunming, supplying Chongqing. Regarding the European war, it was mentioned that the center of the European war situation in the past was at [?]. Recently, there has been no progress in the Anglo-American military efforts. The subtle relationship between the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union regarding this war situation, as well as the Soviet Union's lack of emphasis on the war and its refusal to acknowledge the opening of a second front, as hoped for by the United Kingdom and the United States for the Soviet Union to attack Germany in the east, while the Soviet Union does not implement it, indicates that the alliance between the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union can be described as "sharing the same bed but dreaming different dreams" or "sailing in the same boat but with different purposes," which is a very obvious fact.</p>
<h3>First Police Bureau Judicial Office - Adjustment of Organization</h3>
<p>In order to promote judicial affairs, the First Police Bureau of this city has strengthened its internal organization, merging the Needle and Cold Interrogation Sections into a single Investigation Section. The position of Section Chief will be held by Liu Shao-kui, the former Chief of the Detective Section. In addition, a Narcotics Investigation Section and a Crime Prevention Section have been established. The personnel for the heads of these sections have also been announced: Narcotic Investigation Section Chief Dao Cheng-nuo, Crime Prevention Section Chief Shi Yu-xiang. The aforementioned sections will be officially established and begin operations today (the 1st). As for the personnel for each section and division chief, they will also be formally announced within the next few days.</p>
<h3>Adjustment of Division Chiefs in Various Branch Bureaus</h3>

<h3>Naval Painter – The Navy</h3>
<p>— By Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>Although the hour of Chen Guangrong had reached midnight, the two of them were still talking.</p>
<p>"I stayed in Xiapu for a short time, but I was told I couldn't fly."</p>
<p>Makoto didn't seem particularly upset, and said this with a smile.</p>
<p>"Before becoming a Lieutenant, the Aviation, Gunnery, and Naval Mine Warfare schools must be entered in order. Only after specialized research and determination can one become an advanced science student."</p>
<p>"Then, what is Makoto's specialty?"</p>
<p>"It hasn't reached that stage yet."</p>
<p>"There must be a department you like?"</p>
<p>"Hmm?..."</p>
<p>Makoto seemed shy and smiled. "What?"</p>
<p>"Serving on submarines. That suits your temperament. I had the nickname 'Sea Turtle' during my time at Etajima." Makoto laughed and began to explain the meaning of "Sea Turtle" and the characteristics of submarines.</p>
<p>According to him, the mission on a submarine is the most monotonous in the world, and the hardship is not much. It's also not a glamorous job. If the aviation officer is the protagonist on the stage, then the submarine officer is the supporting actor. Concealment is the only life-saver for submarines. This warrior of endurance requires great patience and sacrifice before launching a torpedo. But the submarines of the Japanese Empire have not yet fired a torpedo at the enemy. The result of forty years of accumulated strength is that no one has seen it. There are even extremists who believe that submarines are useless.</p>
<p>"But, in any case, I like submarines. I'm not very smart, and I don't have any special courage, but in terms of tenacity, I always feel that I will never lose to others even if I serve on submarines."</p>
<p>Makoto revealed his inner secrets without much excitement. Ryuufu, who had known Makoto's monotonous personality since childhood, felt that Makoto's temperament was closely aligned with his submarine aspirations.</p>
<p>When the clock struck once, the two of them were a little tired of talking. Just as they were about to go to sleep, Ryuufu suddenly tapped his forehead and said:</p>
<p>"Oh dear, that's terrible! There's only one quilt."</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter. Didn't we sleep under one quilt when we traveled in the Second Middle School?"</p>
<p>Makoto smiled as he began to take off his suit. (109)</p>
