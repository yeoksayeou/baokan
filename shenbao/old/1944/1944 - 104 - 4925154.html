<h3>歡迎小倉顧問</h3>
<p>國民政府新任最高經濟顧問小倉正　先生，昨日自東京來滬，即將赴京履任。我們謹以最大的誠意表示歡迎。</p>
<p>去年七月初旬，盟邦派遣經濟使節團聘問我邦，當時小倉先生擔任使節團團長，與我邦朝野，歷次懇談。彼時經濟使節團發表訪問主旨：「與中國經濟界及國府方面，對兩國經濟提攜作具體懇談，充分接受中國人士之意見，不僅採取團體行動，並作私人懇談，交換意見，對於中國經濟問題，如物價，金融，貿易及糧食等，均應作充分研究之問題，期對兩國產業經濟之共存共榮，有所際，曾數度爲文貢獻管見，距今雖已閱九月，而目前中國經濟上的病態，不但未有轉機，抑且增加嚴重，所以，我們從前提供的意見，仍有甲乙複述的意義。</p>
<p>中國經濟的病態，已經很深，中日兩國朝野如不及早妥謀補救之策，則危機嚴重，對於中國，對於日本，對於整個大東亞，都有嚴重的不良後果。至於中國經濟的病根所在，是與政治不可分離的，政治的病是因，經濟的病是果，因此，要救經濟的病，就必須首先－至少須同時救治政治的病，否則，終不免徒勞無功。</p>
<p>增加生產，在戰時爲半抑物價，安定民生的根本辦法，也是施行物資統制的先決條件；假使增加生產做不到，即物價無由平抑，統制無從進行，亦即民生無法安定。然而增加生產的實效，絕不足道，相反　，生產率祗見萎縮。以上海而言，爲中國工業之中心，但各項重要民生工業的開工率，都見减低（依照去年調查，紡縱業四成，榨油業五成，染織業三成，事實上目前尙不及此數。）其原因當在　原料缺乏，　原動力不足，　工人食糧問題發生困難。因此，生產萎縮，已成為今日中國最嚴重的經濟病態了。</p>
<p>其次，物價高漲，當然也是最嚴重的經濟病態。遠的不說，就以去年九月至今年二月爲例，則去年十月比九月漲百分之三·六，十一月比十月漲百分之八·八，十二月比十一月漲百分之二七·九，今年一月比去年十二月漲百分之三六·四，今年二月適值舊歷新年以後，比一月份漲百分之五十以上。物價高漲這樣的漫無止境，民生受到莫大的威脅與痛苦，不待解說了。</p>
<p>我們誠懇期待醫治中國經濟病態的好醫生，其殷切之情，猶之大早中望甘霖。有了名醫，可以準確的診斷病態，對症發藥，藥到病除。固然，經濟病態的主因，在於政治不良，而亟謀革新。但經濟措施的技術方面，也很重要。尤其經濟措施的原則與制度雖經確定，而實踐時必須顧到適應中國國情民情的環境，在不背戰時經濟原則之下，措施之間並非一成不變。譬如統制經濟之制度及原則，固然是戰時國家所必須採取者，但在中國實施以來，就但見其弊，未見共利，中國資施統制，不但未能刺激生產，甚至妨碍生產。其原因但知囫圇吞棗引用原則，不知在實施技術上適應特有環境。所以，統制經濟在戰時需要以外，技術上予以放鬆一點，大可考慮。</p>
<p>小倉先生，是日本經濟界權威，經騐宏富，三十年前曾來中國，對中國頗具好感，此番就任國府最高經濟顧問，我們認爲得到一位醫治中國經濟病態的名醫，必能診斷準確，藥到病除，不勝寄以深切之期待。</p>
<h3>日印軍迭佔要塞向伊姆法爾推進　英第四軍主力已陷於困境</h3>
<p>東京十八日中央社電據緬甸前綫電：日印同盟軍刻由東南北三方面向伊姆法爾推進，隨地與敵軍激戰，逐次奪取其前衛陣地，現向巴列爾之敵軍突出陣地猛擊，完全控制伊姆法爾四周各主要陣地，及伊姆法爾盆地各道路之隘路口，節節縮小包圍網。敵於此種情勢下，企圖最後頑强抵抗，雙方於伊姆法爾北方十公里之軍事要點三八三三高地之爭奪戳中；兩軍僅距五十米對峙，數日不斷肉搏激鬥。又日印軍之占領伊姆法爾前衛要塞之堪古拉頓基，實費時三十七小時，防衛伊姆法爾之敵主要陣地，業已逐次崩潰，敵第四軍主力數萬人之運命巳臨最沒途。又日軍北上部隊急追敗敵，向阿薩密至孟加拉鐵路之要衝迪馬普爾進擊，刻沿公路疾進中，十二日晚已進抵布拉爲普得拉平原，占領顚拿巴爾東南十公里之尼齊猶亞德四周各高地，直撲該市，確保各軍事上要點。</p>
<p>森林化為火海到處展開激戰</p>
<p>敵軍以尼齊猶亞德即將陷落，甚感狼狽，除由西倫方面調動機械化第四師及英印軍一師外，更以運輸機運輸三個旅之衆，以防衛迪馬普爾。伊姆法爾北部日軍部隊刻正制壓該方面戰略要點之某高地及該高地西方森古麥等地之敵軍陣地，到處展開激戰。巴列爾方面日軍對巴列爾要塞之攻擊，愈益積極，敵軍於迪馬普爾南北戰綫廣闊陣地中，繼續作殊死之防禦戰，因敵軍爲阻止日軍，乃縱火焚燒該地附近之大森林，刻該地已化爲火海，日軍正在烈火中猛政英印軍殘部。又伊姆法爾南方隘路口之日軍，正與敵强力部隊展開激戰，另一方面日軍挺進隊正進攻梅朗西方之萊馬奈附近，謀切斷比先波爾至西爾其亞之公路，刻該公路之切斷已迫眉睫。</p>
<p>敵降落傘部隊處於日軍包圍</p>
<p>伊姆法爾遭逢如此危險，故敵人又調動其空軍兵力，助援於該方面。但北部富貢地區，加薩附近之敵降落傘挺身隊因無援軍，唯有於日軍之包坐以待斃，此與布其頓，孟多方面英印軍之敗退彼此相映，蜿蜒一千公里，印緬戰線敵軍反攻緬甸之戰略態勢，由於日印同盟軍之攻擊遂潰亂不堪。敵司令官蒙特巴頓鑒於事態重大，乃携同參謀長，親赴伊姆法爾前線激勵將士整頓陣線，但東部印度，愈瀕危殆之消息早已傳遍全印，印度民眾之反英獨立氣氛，愈行昂　，敵陣營正處於　　　　　　　　　　。</p>
<h3>日坪上大使　談泰國近況　與日協力戰意昂揚</h3>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　日駐泰大使坪上，爲與日政府協商要務，前於月之十二日返抵東京，茲國近況如次：泰國根據日泰同盟，無論於軍事經濟乃至文化各方面，均與日本作密切之提携，期早日完遂共同戰爭。泰國對建設亞洲人之亞洲，其情緒愈僞昻揚，且其態度甚爲積極，早已充分發揮大東亞宣言之偉大作用。泰國以此宣言之五原則爲根據，已認淸其國家存立之基礎，及其於共榮圈內之地位。泰國朝野之積極協力態度，茲舉例以言之，如最近泰學士院舉行年會時，該院總裁溫華氏曾謂，研討與共榮圈內各國同志機關間相互提携，究討將來各種方策，乃學土院之一大任務，此足表明泰學界正積極協力完遂戰爭，亦爲潔可注目者。他如泰國對建築飛機塲鐵這公路。及軍事基地·兵站基地等基本事項，亦完全保持與日協力，加緊相互間聯擊。泰政府現正力謀確立戰時體制，關於防空對策，業由國防部移交首相直轄，又爲統一國民意識起見，靑少年運動亦由敎育部移交首相直轄。目前國民之戰爭意識倍極昻揚，本年一月曾舉辦女子士官學校，女子聯隊則將於六月二十四日革命耙念日成立，隊長一職，預定由現任砲兵中佐之畢本首相夫人担任，故婦女戰意亦極旺盛。</p>
<h3>孟買大火損失奇重</h3>
<p>里斯本十六日中央社電　據孟買電：十四日下午孟貿港灣發生火災，雖經軍隊出動撲救，然火勢仍極猛烈，燃燒達十二小時之久，故孟買中心區頓成廢墟，迄十五日上午六時大火始熄。事後據市當局發表：至現在止，醫院收容負傷者已達千餘名，其中已有七名因傷重身死，房產被焚毀之居民約達數千名。</p>
<h3>日學生參加　生產陣營</h3>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　日政府爲動員全國學生，參加生產陣營，前曾根機決戰非常措置，飭令全國學生投身生產陣營期問爲一年。茲以第一期動員準備完善，並於日前着手實施第二期動員。現查第二期東京都整年勤務學生，業已預定十八日僅住友通信等各工塲服務，參加者有男子中等學校七十二校之最高學年學生若干人，至女子學校學生之動員措置，則俟都敎育局及警視廳連絡後着手進行，目下正在進行調查中。此外其他女校刻正與飛機工塲逋絡，並預定四月份內完成大部份之動員，學校工塲實習人員在工作時問及種種之環境上，均與投身其他工塲之服務人員受同樣待遇，又衣工於文部省未通吿前暫不舉行。</p>
<h3>葡派員視察　的摩爾島　日予以便利</h3>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　日外務省當局十六日下午二時發表：葡萄牙政府爲視察葡領的摩爾島（即帝汶島）之葡人生活狀况，前擬派遣該國官憲赴該島視察，當時日本政府鑒於日葡兩國之友好關係，已對葡國此抓希望表示同意，並會予該國視察官憲以旅行上之種種便利。因此葡政府自經日方同意後，即曾派遣澳門總督秘書長哥斯達上尉爲視察員，哥氏於奉命後，即曾於三月上旬由澳門出發行抵的摩爾，於視察任務完畢後，該氏已於本月中旬取道東京返抵澳門。</p>
<h3>歐戰本年內　恐難結束</h3>
<p>里斯本十六日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：據華盛頓消息，美海軍副參謀長霍恩中將在衆院預算委員會宣稱，歐戰本年不能結束。美海軍總司令金格上將亦在該委員會陳述，預言未來六個月間美軍之損失，將大有增加，並將於戰爭期內維持其高率。</p>
<h3>國府局部調整後　經濟行政統一　經濟復興前途可期</h3>
<p>南京十六日中央社電　本月十三日最高國防會議第四十五次會議決議，將糧食部裁撤，原有該部主管事務，移歸實業部管理，又於本月十四日國府明令發表建設部長陳春圃氏調任廣東省長，至遞遺建設部長一職，則特任實業部長陳君　氏兼署。此次國府經濟行政機構之局部調整，與主管人事之更迭，此在國府戰時經濟復興建設前途，實具有劃期之意義。蓋我戰時經濟建設工作之推進，不能牧獲預期成效之原因，固屬甚多，但經濟行政機構之不能統一，職權之不能集中，亦爲不可否認之事實，即以農業增產工作而言，如糧食增產之　於糧食部，水利增產之隸於建設部，棉麻增產及林墾工作等則又隸之於實業部，於是非僅人力資力分散，且計劃方案更有繁複分歧之弊。際此全面增產聲中，確有重加調整之必要。此次國府爲革除上述弊病，毅然將糧食部裁撤，事權集中於實業部，同時更因陳春圃氏之繼長粵政·而將建設部長道缺決定由陳君　氏兼署，使今後經濟行政工作極重於統一運　之下，期能有更長足之進展，完成經濟建設大業，潔信經此調整後，我國戰時經濟建設行政，在職權上已吿完全築中，在機構上亦可統一，今後祇須本諸旣定國策，竭力推進，則經濟復興前途，以至於大東亞戰爭之完遂，大東亞共榮建設之　　　　　收指臂之效。</p>

<h3>華萊士　赴渝任務</h3>
<p>里斯本十五日中央社電　美國副總統華萊士此次之決定訪問重慶，各方對之頗多揣測，渝中央社駐華盛頓特派員對此於十三日曾稱，最近美國高級軍人訪渝者雖多，但高級文官訪渝者尙不多見，故華萊士之訪渝，頗爲各方注目，由華之訪渝，今後美渝關係將益緊密，將與渝府內政不無關聯云，蓋當今美國內高唱對渝府再認識之時，華萊士之訪渝，頗堪注意也。據另息，羅斯福特使華萊士訪渝，乃爲調解最近之惡化之國共關係者。按現渝府對外國駐渝記者之通訊，均嚴加限制，但關於國共相尅，通貨膨脹，肅正留學生思想等問題，仍不免傳入美國，因之已引起美洲各國之不安。</p>
<h3>英美對土耳其　提出要求</h3>
<p>安加拉十六日中央社電　海通社訊：土京昨有非常之外父活動。伊斯美總統與總理薩拉卓格魯舉行長時問之談話，外長曼里卓格魯則與美大使斯坦哈特密談甚久，其談話之內容，係關於英美對土耳其以原料供應德國之外交步驟。蘇聯大使維諾格　　未負有外交特殊使命，自安加拉起程經開羅返莫斯科，何時可以返任，現尙未悉。</p>

<h3>東綫德軍攻守兼施　克島展開消耗戰</h3>
<p>柏林十六日中央社電　海通社訊：東綫南北兩路之局勢，於週末略有變化。北路之蘇軍調到更多之生力軍，集國進攻浦斯柯夫，迄木能突破德軍防地，南路克里米亞之局勢極爲緊張，蘇機械部隊與坦克車隊分兩路進攻，貝萊柯浦與寇許蘇軍之壓力，與側面進攻之威脅，使辛費羅波爾之防軍不得不從事撤退，蘇聯海軍陸戰隊與紅軍主力自北聯合進犯，以圖包圍克里米亞東南部之全部山區。德軍在東錢北路與克里米亞區採取守勢，德羅洪軍隊在兩路之攻勢益趨活躍，蘇軍似等待生力軍之抵達，同時更利用此時問部署軍隊。聶斯特下游之戰綫，已移至該河南岸，聶斯特河與寒萊河間之陣地，亦　　　　　　　　　　　至巴斯卡尼（Pasconi）以禦蘇軍向基希納夫方面之進攻。普魯斯河迤西德軍發動堅强之反攻，台拉頓（Deladyn）柯維爾區之德軍亦有攻勢活動，德洪聯軍在該區除建立堅强之防綫外，更將利用該地爲發動攻勢之根據地。</p>

<h3>確立計劃經濟　建設健全的印度　鮑斯主席對記者團談話</h3>
<p>由於印度人民的意志而成立的自由印度臨時政府，當進駐祖國時。江特拉飽斯主席於四日正午發表第一次聲明後，立即與記者團會見，在問答中闡明目由印度臨時政府的行政方針，消除以前英國所設立的一切榨取機關，確立計劃經濟，建設健全的印度國。以下爲其問答：</p>
<p>（問）　發表第二次聲明的理由是：</p>
<p>（答）　使印度民衆更明瞭自由印度臨時政府的全貌，　逐敵方的　宣傳，獲得全印度民衆的協力，建設印度人的印度。</p>
<p>建高的理念</p>
<p>（問）　建設工作的進展情形加何？</p>
<p>（答）　根據已經決定的具體方案，必要人員已經到達當地，開始建設工作，建設的第一步，首先在於再建業已破壊的經濟。</p>
<p>（問）　對於重建自由地域經濟的根本理念呢？</p>
<p>（答）　在現在的印度，在自由經濟機構之下，少數人擁有巨大的私利，我們的根本理念，即在於消滅這情形，樹立强固的計劃經濟，努力增進民衆的福利。</p>
<p>（問）　政治的新秩序之根本理念呢？</p>
<p>（答）　我們要消滅擁護少數人的利益，向民眾榨取的一切英國人的榨取機關，以確保民衆的最低生活。此次革命不單是政洽革命，也是社會革命。且對此新秩序的確立，預料不會有一點困難，我們以爲富裕階級的人們也會欣然參加我們這方面的。前天有一個資產家，送來一張空着金額的支票，希望我們隨意塡上數自應用。</p>
<p>（問）　關於民族問題呢？</p>
<p>（答）　印度國內有許多種族，所以是一個很複雜的問題。這本來是英國狡猾的政策。如其特別提出這問題，也不免蹈英國人的覆轍，所以臨時政府對此不加干涉，全部印度人一律平等處理。</p>
<p>英美的反響</p>
<p>（問）　對第一次聲明的反響如何？</p>
<p>（答）　第一，先說敵方的反響，英人當局最高幹部對此非常恐怖，印度的敵軍最高幹部，在此以前，對印度國民軍的活躍，從不有一言提及，但中立國方面及美國則對此大爲關心</p>
<p>美國非常担心此次協力日本軍作戰的印度國民軍之大活躍。從軍事上看來，重慶亦然，蓋恐怕對重慶的惟一運輸路被截斷。中立國方而亦重視此次作戰，而預言必將產生重大的結果。至於印度國內，美國系的宣傳機關稱日本軍的進入印度不過是威嚇性的進擊，以前從印度向國外廣播，宣傳說印度國民軍完全是日本軍的虧來部隊，日本軍決不進入印度境內，然而自從此次日印軍駢肩踏進印境後，乃廣播說「國民軍的裝配，兵器實極粗劣」，作虛偽宣傳。</p>
<p>再看印度國內民衆的反嚮。反英運動日趨計劃，這在前次在印度中央議會中提出的政府預算案遭否決一本就可以明自。印度議會是少數的民選議員與多數的官選議員所組成的。然而這少數議員中的會議派議員的領袖們雖被投獄，但預算案卒遭否決，可見多數議員中的親英份子，也被印度國民軍的進舉祖國所刺激轉而反英。這是全印度充溢者反英機運的證據。</p>
<p>這裏可注目者，印度靑年層之活潑的行動。表面上，因英當局的強壓，以國民會議派爲中心的反英運動，似頗平靜，但以印度靑年層爲中心的秘密運動擇日趨擴大。道些靑年層，早已有了準備，祗要我，立刻就可以起事。</p>
<p>其次，再想指摘英國的戰意非常軟弱。一九四二年日均進駐緬甸時，英國已秘密潑出撤退的指令。以此看來，可知現在的英國是怎樣的　法。總之，印度一激化，印度的革命，釀成秘密運動，對此次我國民軍作戰的結果，致極大的期待。（翔譯自四月六日東京讀賣報知</p>

<p>第一區（新併區除外）各警察分署保甲辦事處，自於上月下旬開始辦理換發居住證之準備工作以來，迄今各保甲居民，尚在陸續呈繳甲諸書，據記者向各辦事處探悉：居住證之換發，須俟警署當局將居民所呈繳之申請書全部審閱完畢，始可依次規定保各領取日期時間，故此項正式換發工作之開始，當在五月一日以後。同時又悉西區居住證之換發，並未於四月十日開始，蓋該區申請手續迄今猶未着子辦理。</p>

<h3>提高公用事業之效率</h3>
<p>— 聶士</p>
<p>近代都市建設有待於公用事業之服務效率者甚大，上海爲我國最大都市，素以公用事業之發達著稱。惟事變以來由於戰事之影響，環境之變遷，公用事業之服務效率遂日漸降低，而於今爲烈。就我人所目濡耳染者，約有下列數端現象：</p>
<p>有因戰時環境而影響效率者　如燃料之恐慌而限制用電，因防空而滅弱路燈光度，因限制用電及汽油缺乏而影響公用車輛之行駛皆是。又有因軍事行動阻碍郵路及電路之暢通以致延擱郵件電信者，然此等皆爲戰時條件下不可避免之現象，姑暫弗論。</p>
<p>有故意懈怠於服務者　我人可舉一般市民共所詬病者以例之，公用軍輛藉口乘客擁擠而故意過站不停，即在不擁擠之情况下亦然；水電公司假借限制用電對用水亦加限制，如法商水電公司即是；負責投遞郵件電信者以私務忙碌藉端戰時條件而故意延擱等皆是。</p>
<p>有利用職務地們以舞弊者　如所週知，今日公用車輛售票員之揩汕問題已引起大衆之注意，而其嚴重性決不亞於揩汕問題者，即為今日水電公司職員特別是抄表員遇有超過限制以偽造紀錄而受賄者，今日大量郵件之遺失或缺少特別是書籍包裹重件，殊足令人懷疑。</p>
<p>我人如一究上述現象產生之原因，則除戰時條件非輕易所得解決者外，則最大者厥爲公用事業之服務人員生活太淸苦，待遇太菲薄是也。就我人所知，彼等普通每月待遇恒僅千餘元之譜，以此待過，欲求解決平均一家五六口之生活，安可得乎？無怪乎舞弊之象百出。日　苦思何以舞弊，　論提高服務效率，無怪乎車站輪埠儘多見彼等穿有制服者營彼單帮生涯，彼等或告假而爲或抽暇而爲，則影鄉於服務效率者不言而喻更無怪乎因生活不能解決，不能安心服務，以致懈於服務者。</p>
<p>為此，我人不得不認為調整公用事業服務人員之待遇爲提高服務效率之先決條件，否則長此以往，彼等或另有生路，紛紛星散；或勉强敷衍，每祝愈下；或以副業爲重，如有若無，則上海公用事業之前途，直不堪設相也。他方面，各該公司常局或可仿第一警察局組織消費合作社以減輕同人負担，如能由各該當局主動發起組織，社會有力機關及人士定能協力合作，正如協力警察合作社然。以上而點深望各該常局詳加考慮</p>
<p>再者，我人亦希望市政及各該公用事業當局在可能範圍內以市民便利爲前提，盡力解決困難所在。如疏通煤源，以期增加電力供給市民正當之需用，夜間路燈於不妨害防空條件之下增加光度以改善治安情祝，新郵路及新電路之開闢以期加速寄遞放送。同時嚴格告誠服務人員不得藉端留難，懈於服務，及舞弊情事，否則從嚴依法處罰。如此公用事業之前途，方有可期也。</p>

        <h1>1944 - n104</h1>
<h3>Welcome Consultant Ogura</h3>
<p>Mr. Tadashi Ogura, the newly appointed Supreme Economic Consultant of the National Government, arrived in Shanghai yesterday from Tokyo and will soon go to Nanjing to take office. We would like to express our warmest welcome.</p>
<p>In early July of last year, the Allied nations sent an economic mission to consult with our country. At that time, Mr. Ogura served as the head of the mission and held numerous sincere talks with various sectors of our society. The economic mission issued a statement on its purpose of the visit: "To engage in concrete discussions with the Chinese economic community and the National Government on economic cooperation between the two countries, to fully accept the opinions of Chinese people, to take collective action as well as private consultations to exchange views, and to conduct thorough research on Chinese economic issues such as prices, finance, trade, and food." In order to contribute to the co-existence and co-prosperity of the industries and economies of the two countries, we have repeatedly contributed articles offering our humble opinions. Although nine months have passed since then, not only has there been no turnaround in the current morbid state of the Chinese economy, but it has also become more serious. Therefore, the opinions we provided in the past still have meaning to be reiterated.</p>
<p>The morbid state of the Chinese economy is already very deep. If the governments and people of China and Japan do not devise remedial measures as soon as possible, the crisis will be severe, with serious adverse consequences for China, for Japan, and for the entire Greater East Asia. As for the root cause of China's economic ills, it is inseparable from politics. Political illness is the cause, and economic illness is the result. Therefore, to cure the economic illness, we must first—or at least simultaneously—cure the political illness; otherwise, it will inevitably be in vain.</p>
<p>Increasing production is a fundamental way to suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihoods during wartime, and it is also a prerequisite for implementing material control. If increasing production cannot be achieved, there will be no way to stabilize prices, control cannot be carried out, and people's livelihoods cannot be stabilized. However, the actual effect of increasing production is hardly worth mentioning. On the contrary, the productivity rate has shrunk. Taking Shanghai as an example, as the center of Chinese industry, the operating rates of various important people's livelihood industries have decreased (according to last year's survey, the textile industry was 40%, the oil pressing industry was 50%, and the dyeing and weaving industry was 30%, but in fact, it is currently even less than these numbers). The reasons for this are the lack of raw materials, insufficient power, and difficulties in workers' food supply. Therefore, the shrinkage of production has become the most serious economic morbidity in China today.</p>
<p>Secondly, soaring prices are certainly the most serious economic morbidity. Not to mention the distant past, taking the period from September of last year to February of this year as an example, October was 3.6% higher than September, November was 8.8% higher than October, December was 27.9% higher than November, January of this year was 36.4% higher than December of last year, and February of this year, which coincided with the Lunar New Year, was more than 50% higher than January. The endless rise in prices has caused great threats and pain to people's livelihoods, which goes without saying.</p>
<p>We sincerely look forward to a good doctor who can cure China's economic morbidity, with a feeling of eager anticipation like waiting for sweet rain in a severe drought. With a famous doctor, we can accurately diagnose the morbidity and prescribe the right medicine to cure the disease. Of course, the main cause of economic morbidity lies in political defects, and we urgently seek innovation. However, the technical aspects of economic measures are also very important. In particular, although the principles and systems of economic measures have been determined, the environment of adapting to China's national conditions and people's sentiments must be taken into account during implementation. Under the premise of not violating the principles of wartime economy, the measures should not be invariable. For example, the system and principles of controlled economy are certainly necessary for countries in wartime, but since their implementation in China, we have only seen their drawbacks and not their common benefits. China's implementation of control has not only failed to stimulate production, but has even hindered production. The reason for this is that we only know how to swallow principles whole without knowing how to adapt to the unique environment in the implementation technology. Therefore, it is worth considering to relax the control economy a little in terms of technology, in addition to the needs of wartime.</p>
<p>Mr. Ogura is an authority in the Japanese economic community with extensive experience. He came to China 30 years ago and has a good impression of China. This time, he is taking office as the Supreme Economic Consultant of the National Government. We believe that we have found a famous doctor who can cure China's economic morbidity. He will surely be able to diagnose accurately and cure the disease, and we cannot help but place deep expectations on him.</p>
<h3>Japanese-Indian Troops Repeatedly Occupy Fortresses and Advance Towards Imphal; Main Force of British Fourth Army Trapped in Difficult Situation</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency Telegram)—According to a dispatch from the Burmese front: The Japanese-Indian allied forces are advancing towards Imphal from the east, west, south, and north, engaging in fierce battles with enemy troops along the way, gradually seizing their forward positions. They are currently fiercely attacking the enemy's salient position in Pailel, completely controlling the main positions around Imphal and the narrow entrances to the roads in the Imphal basin, gradually shrinking the encirclement. Under these circumstances, the enemy is attempting a final tenacious resistance. The two sides are fighting fiercely for Hill 3833, a military stronghold ten kilometers north of Imphal; the two armies are facing each other only fifty meters apart, engaging in continuous hand-to-hand combat for several days. Furthermore, the Japanese-Indian forces spent 37 hours occupying Kanglatongbi, a key forward fortress of Imphal. The enemy's main defense positions in Imphal have gradually collapsed, and the fate of the main force of the enemy's Fourth Army, numbering tens of thousands, is at its most precarious. In addition, the Japanese army's northward unit is rapidly pursuing the defeated enemy, advancing towards Dimapur, a key point on the Assam-Bengal railway, and is currently advancing rapidly along the road. On the evening of the 12th, it had advanced to the plains of Brahmaputra, occupying the highlands around Nicima, ten kilometers southeast of Tenaphal, directly attacking the city and securing key military points.</p>
<p>Forests Turn into Seas of Fire as Fierce Battles Unfold Everywhere</p>
<p>The enemy troops are extremely embarrassed by the impending fall of Nicima and, in addition to mobilizing the 4th Mechanized Division and an Anglo-Indian division from the Shillong area, are also transporting three brigades by transport aircraft to defend Dimapur. The Japanese army units north of Imphal are currently suppressing enemy positions at a certain highland, a strategic point in that area, and at Sengumai and other places west of that highland, engaging in fierce battles everywhere. On the Pailel front, the Japanese army's attacks on the Pailel fortress are becoming increasingly active. The enemy army continues to fight a desperate defensive battle in the vast positions north and south of Dimapur. In order to stop the Japanese army, the enemy set fire to the large forests near the area, and the area has now turned into a sea of fire. The Japanese army is fiercely attacking the remnants of the British-Indian army in the fire. In addition, the Japanese army at the narrow entrances south of Imphal is engaged in fierce battles with strong enemy units. On the other hand, the Japanese army's assault team is attacking near Laimanai, west of Melaung, in an attempt to cut off the highway from Bishnupur to Silchar. The cutting off of this highway is imminent.</p>
<p>Enemy Parachute Troops Surrounded by Japanese Army</p>
<p>Imphal is facing such danger that the enemy has also mobilized its air force to assist in that area. However, the enemy parachute commando team near Fougakhong and Karsa in the north has no reinforcements and can only sit and wait to be annihilated by the Japanese army. This is in stark contrast to the defeats of the British-Indian army in the Bukhtan and Maungdaw areas. The enemy's strategic posture of counter-attacking Burma on the Indo-Burmese front, stretching for a thousand kilometers, has been disrupted by the attacks of the Japanese-Indian allied forces. In view of the seriousness of the situation, the enemy commander, Mountbatten, personally went to the Imphal front with his chief of staff to encourage the soldiers to reorganize their lines. However, the news that eastern India is becoming increasingly precarious has spread throughout India, and the anti-British independence sentiment of the Indian people is rising. The enemy camp is in a state of ____.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ambassador Tsubogami Discusses the Current Situation in Thailand; Cooperation with Japan Filled with Fighting Spirit</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency Telegram)—Japanese Ambassador to Thailand, Tsubogami, returned to Tokyo on the 12th of the month to discuss important matters with the Japanese government. He described the current situation in Thailand as follows: Thailand, based on the Japan-Thailand alliance, is cooperating closely with Japan in all aspects, including military, economic, and cultural, in order to complete the joint war as soon as possible. Thailand's enthusiasm for building Asia for Asians is becoming increasingly fervent, and its attitude is very active, having already fully demonstrated the great role of the Greater East Asia Declaration. Thailand has recognized the foundation of its national existence and its position within the Co-Prosperity Sphere based on the five principles of this declaration. To illustrate the active cooperative attitude of the Thai government and people, for example, at the recent annual meeting of the Thai Academy, the president of the Academy, Wan Waithayakon, stated that studying mutual cooperation with comrades in the Co-Prosperity Sphere and exploring various future strategies is a major task of the Academy. This shows that the Thai academic community is actively cooperating to complete the war and is worthy of attention. In other aspects, Thailand is also fully maintaining cooperation with Japan in basic matters such as building airfields, railways, highways, and military and logistics bases, and is strengthening mutual contact. The Thai government is currently striving to establish a wartime system. Regarding air defense measures, it has been transferred from the Ministry of National Defense to the direct jurisdiction of the Prime Minister. In addition, in order to unify national consciousness, youth movements have also been transferred from the Ministry of Education to the direct jurisdiction of the Prime Minister. At present, the national war consciousness is extremely high. A women's officer school was held in January of this year, and a women's regiment will be established on the 24th of June, the anniversary of the revolution. The position of regimental commander is expected to be held by Mrs. Phibun, the Prime Minister, who is currently a lieutenant colonel in the artillery. Therefore, the fighting spirit of women is also very strong.</p>
<h3>Serious Losses in Bombay Fire</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 16th (Central News Agency Telegram)—According to a dispatch from Bombay: A fire broke out in Bombay harbor on the afternoon of the 14th. Although troops were dispatched to put out the fire, the fire was still extremely fierce and burned for twelve hours. As a result, the central area of Bombay became a ruin. According to the city authorities, as of now, hospitals have admitted more than a thousand injured people, of whom seven have died from their injuries, and the homes of about several thousand residents have been destroyed by the fire.</p>
<h3>Japanese Students Participate in Production Corps</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency Telegram)—In order to mobilize students across the country to participate in the production corps, the Japanese government previously decided on emergency measures for the decisive battle, ordering students across the country to devote themselves to the production corps for a period of one year. Now that the preparations for the first phase of mobilization have been completed, the second phase of mobilization has been started in recent days. It has now been found that students in Tokyo who will be working full-time throughout the year in the second phase have already been scheduled to work at various factories such as Sumitomo Communications from the 18th onwards. The participants include a number of students in their final year from 72 male secondary schools. As for the mobilization measures for female school students, they will be initiated after communication between the Metropolitan Education Bureau and the Metropolitan Police Department, and a survey is currently underway. In addition, other female schools are currently contacting aircraft factories, and most of the mobilization is expected to be completed by April. Personnel undergoing school factory internships will receive the same treatment in terms of working hours and various conditions as personnel serving in other factories. In addition, clothing labor will not be held temporarily until the Ministry of Education issues a notice.</p>
<h3>Portugal Sends Personnel to Inspect Timor Island; Japan Facilitates</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency Telegram)—The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced at 2:00 PM on the 16th: In order to inspect the living conditions of Portuguese people in Portuguese Timor (i.e., Timor Island), the Portuguese government previously intended to send officials from the country to inspect the island. At that time, the Japanese government, in view of the friendly relations between Japan and Portugal, expressed its agreement with Portugal's hope and would provide the Portuguese inspection officials with various conveniences for travel. Therefore, after obtaining Japan's consent, the Portuguese government dispatched Captain Costa, the secretary-general of the Governor of Macau, as an inspector. After being ordered, Captain Costa departed from Macau in early March and arrived in Timor. After completing the inspection mission, he returned to Macau via Tokyo in the middle of this month.</p>
<h3>European War Unlikely to End This Year</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 16th (Central News Agency Telegram)—German News Agency: According to a Washington dispatch, U.S. Deputy Chief of Naval Operations, Vice Admiral Horne, stated in the House Appropriations Committee that the European War cannot end this year. U.S. Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral King, also stated in the committee, predicting that the losses of the U.S. military will increase greatly in the next six months and will maintain their high rate during the war.</p>
<h3>Economic Administration Unified After Partial Adjustment by National Government; Economic Revival Prospects Promising</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency Telegram)—The 45th meeting of the Supreme National Defense Council on the 13th of this month resolved to abolish the Ministry of Food and transfer the original affairs under the Ministry's jurisdiction to the Ministry of Industry. On the 14th of this month, the National Government issued a decree announcing the transfer of Chen Chunpu, the Minister of Construction, to the post of Governor of Guangdong Province. The vacant post of Minister of Construction was specially appointed to be concurrently held by Chen Kung-po, the Minister of Industry. This partial adjustment of the National Government's economic administrative institutions and the change of personnel in charge has epoch-making significance for the future of economic revival and construction by the National Government during wartime. The reasons why the promotion of our wartime economic construction work has not achieved the expected results are certainly numerous, but the inability to unify economic administrative institutions and the inability to concentrate powers are undeniable facts. Taking the work of increasing agricultural production as an example, such as the increase in food production being under the Ministry of Food, the increase in water conservancy being under the Ministry of Construction, and the increase in cotton and hemp production and land reclamation work being under the Ministry of Industry, not only are human and financial resources dispersed, but the plans and programs also have the disadvantages of being complicated and divergent. In the midst of the current nationwide call for increased production, there is a definite need for readjustment. In order to eliminate the above-mentioned drawbacks, the National Government resolutely abolished the Ministry of Food and concentrated powers in the Ministry of Industry. At the same time, because of Chen Chunpu's succession to the governorship of Guangdong and the decision to have Chen Kung-po concurrently hold the vacant post of Minister of Construction, the economic administrative work will be carried out under a highly unified operation, with the hope that it can make greater progress and complete the great cause of economic construction. It is believed that after this adjustment, the administration of our country's wartime economic construction has been completely consolidated in terms of powers and unified in terms of institutions. In the future, as long as we proceed with our established national policies and strive to promote them, the prospects for economic revival, the completion of the Greater East Asia War, and the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere will be as easy as moving our fingers and arms.</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Bomb Nanxiong and Jian'ou</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 16th (Central News Agency Telegram)—Eight Japanese fighter-bombers bombed Nanxiong airfield in northern Guangdong Province at noon on the 14th. Braving heavy enemy fire, they destroyed enemy camouflage areas and ancillary facilities, and destroyed a small aircraft parked on the ground by the enemy. The Japanese aircraft have now safely returned to base.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency Telegram)—On the 15th, a new Japanese air unit made a surprise attack on the Neixiang Yuzhong airfield in southwestern Henan Province, with bombs hitting the airfield's runways. Another team of Japanese aircraft also attacked the Jian'ou airfield on the same day in adverse weather conditions. Braving intense anti-aircraft fire from the ground, they made accurate strikes, with bombs hitting runways and other locations. The airfield was temporarily unusable.</p>
<h3>Ochiai Concurrently Serves as Advisor to Wuhan Headquarters</h3>
<p>Hankou, 16th (Central News Agency Telegram)—The position of advisor to the Wuhan Headquarters of the Military Affairs Commission, previously held by Mr. Imai, is now concurrently held by Mr. Ochiai, the head of the Allied Liaison Department stationed in Hankou. The Headquarters specially issued a notice to its subordinates yesterday to inform them of this.</p>
<h3>Wallace's Mission to Chongqing</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency Telegram)—There has been much speculation about Vice President Wallace's decision to visit Chongqing this time. The Chongqing Central News Agency correspondent in Washington stated on the 13th that although many senior U.S. military officials have visited Chongqing recently, senior civilian officials have not visited as often. Therefore, Wallace's visit to Chongqing is attracting much attention. Wallace's visit will further strengthen U.S.-Chongqing relations and will be related to the internal affairs of the Chongqing government. At a time when the U.S. is advocating a re-recognition of the Chongqing government, Wallace's visit to Chongqing is noteworthy. According to another report, Roosevelt's envoy, Wallace's visit to Chongqing, is to mediate the recently deteriorating relations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. Currently, the Chongqing government has strictly restricted communications from foreign correspondents stationed in Chongqing, but issues such as the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, currency inflation, and the rectification of the thoughts of students studying abroad still inevitably spread to the United States, which has caused anxiety in the Americas.</p>
<h3>Britain and the United States Make Demands on Turkey</h3>
<p>Ankara, 16th (Central News Agency Telegram)—Reuters: There was extraordinary diplomatic activity in Ankara yesterday. President Ismet Inönü and Prime Minister Saraçoğlu held lengthy talks, while Foreign Minister Menemencioğlu had a long secret meeting with U.S. Ambassador Steinhardt. The content of the talks concerned the diplomatic steps taken by Britain and the United States regarding Turkey's supply of raw materials to Germany. Soviet Ambassador Vinogradov, who was not carrying any special diplomatic mission, departed from Ankara for Cairo and returned to Moscow. When he will return to his post is still unknown.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 16th (Central News Agency Telegram)—According to a dispatch from Ankara, Turkish Foreign Minister Menemencioğlu met with reporters on the 16th and spoke about the Allied policy towards Turkey, saying that the Turkish government has received documents from the British and American governments demanding that Turkey sever relations with the Axis powers, and the Turkish government is currently considering this.</p>
<h3>British Experts Leave Turkey and Return Home</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 16th (Central News Agency Telegram)—German News Agency: According to a report from London, 340 British technical personnel have left Turkey since the breakdown of talks between Britain and Turkey in Ankara in February.</p>
<h3>German Troops on Eastern Front Adopt Offensive and Defensive Tactics; Attrition Warfare Unfolds on Crimean Peninsula</h3>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency Telegram)—Reuters: The situation on the Eastern Front has changed slightly at the weekend in both the northern and southern sectors. In the northern sector, Soviet forces have deployed more reinforcements and concentrated their attacks on Pskov, but have so far been unable to break through the German defenses. The situation in Crimea in the southern sector is extremely tense. Soviet mechanized units and tank columns are attacking in two directions. The pressure from the Soviets on Perekop and Kerch, and the threat of flanking attacks, have forced the defenders of Simferopol to withdraw. Soviet naval infantry and the main force of the Red Army are jointly attacking from the north, attempting to encircle the entire mountainous area in southeastern Crimea. The German army is adopting a defensive posture in the northern sector of the Eastern Front and in the Crimean area. The Romanian army is becoming more active in both offensives. The Soviet forces seem to be waiting for the arrival of reinforcements, and are also using this time to deploy troops. The front line downstream of the Dniester River has shifted to the south bank of the river. The positions between the Dniester and the Southern Bug River are also being extended to Pascani to defend against Soviet advances towards Chisinau. German troops west of the Prut River have launched a strong counter-offensive. German troops in the Delatyn-Kovel area are also engaged in offensive activities. In addition to establishing strong defense lines in the area, the German-Romanian Allied forces will use the area as a base for launching offensives.</p>
<h3>German Preparedness on Mediterranean Coast; Active Submarines in the Adriatic Sea</h3>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency Telegram)—Recently, the anti-Axis forces have been clamoring for the launch of an offensive operation in Europe, but the German army's state of preparedness has also been completed. Field Marshal Rundstedt recently inspected the defenses of the Mediterranean coast in southern France, met with the commanders of the coastal defense forces in the area, and reviewed the standby reserve units. It has now been confirmed that the German defense positions are extremely strong.</p>
<p>Agram, 16th (Central News Agency Telegram)—Reuters: Official sources state that enemy submarines attempting to approach the Dalmatian coast were repelled near Šibenik harbor and Hvar Island, between Split and Zadar.</p>

The work has now begun.</p>
<h3>Establishing a Planned Economy, Building a Sound India: Chairman Bose's Speech to the Press Corps</h3>
<p>When the Provisional Government of Free India, established by the will of the Indian people, advances into the motherland, Chairman Jiangtela Bose, after issuing his first statement at noon on the 4th, immediately met with the press corps. In the question-and-answer session, he clarified the administrative guidelines of the Provisional Government of Free India, eliminating all the exploitative mechanisms previously established by the British, establishing a planned economy, and building a sound India. The following is the question-and-answer session:</p>
<p>(Question) What is the reason for issuing the second statement?</p>
<p>(Answer) To make the Indian people more aware of the whole picture of the Provisional Government of Free India, to counteract enemy propaganda, to obtain the cooperation of all the Indian people, and to build an India for the Indians.</p>
<p>Lofty Ideals</p>
<p>(Question) How is the progress of construction work?</p>
<p>(Answer) According to the concrete plan that has been decided, the necessary personnel have already arrived at the location and started construction work. The first step of construction lies in rebuilding the already destroyed economy.</p>
<p>(Question) What is the fundamental concept for rebuilding the economy of the free region?</p>
<p>(Answer) In today's India, under the free economic system, a few people possess huge private interests. Our fundamental concept lies in eliminating this situation, establishing a strong planned economy, and striving to improve the welfare of the people.</p>
<p>(Question) What is the fundamental concept of the new political order?</p>
<p>(Answer) We want to eliminate all the British exploitative mechanisms that protect the interests of the few and exploit the people, to ensure the minimum living standards of the people. This revolution is not only a political revolution but also a social revolution. And for the establishment of this new order, we do not expect any difficulties. We believe that the wealthy class will also gladly participate in our cause. The day before yesterday, a capitalist sent a blank check with the amount left empty, hoping that we would fill in the number as we wished.</p>
<p>(Question) What about the national question?</p>
<p>(Answer) India has many ethnic groups, so it is a very complicated issue. This was originally a cunning policy of the British. If we specifically raise this issue, we will inevitably follow in the footsteps of the British, so the Provisional Government will not interfere in this matter, and all Indians will be treated equally.</p>
<p>Reactions from Britain and the United States</p>
<p>(Question) What is the reaction to the first statement?</p>
<p>(Answer) First, let's talk about the enemy's reaction. The highest-ranking British authorities are very terrified of this. Before this, the highest-ranking enemy officers in India never mentioned the activities of the Indian National Army. However, the neutral countries and the United States are very concerned about this.</p>
<p>The United States is very worried about the great success of the Indian National Army, which is cooperating with the Japanese army in this campaign. From a military point of view, so is Chongqing, because they are afraid that the only transport route to Chongqing will be cut off. The neutral countries also attach importance to this campaign and predict that it will produce significant results. As for India, the American propaganda organs claim that the entry of the Japanese army into India is only a threatening attack. Previously, they broadcast from India to foreign countries, propagating that the Indian National Army was completely a puppet force of the Japanese army, and that the Japanese army would never enter Indian territory. However, since the Japanese and Indian armies marched side by side into India, they have been broadcasting that "the equipment and weapons of the National Army are extremely crude," making false propaganda.</p>
<p>Let's look at the reaction of the Indian people. The anti-British movement is becoming increasingly planned. This can be clearly seen from the fact that the government budget proposal was rejected in the Indian Central Assembly. The Indian Assembly is composed of a small number of elected members and a large number of officially appointed members. However, even though the leaders of the Congress Party members among these few elected members were imprisoned, the budget proposal was eventually rejected. This shows that the pro-British elements among the majority of members were also stimulated by the advance of the Indian National Army into their motherland and turned against the British. This is evidence that all of India is filled with anti-British sentiment.</p>
<p>What is noteworthy here is the active actions of the Indian youth. On the surface, due to the strong suppression by the British authorities, the anti-British movement centered on the National Congress Party seems to be quite calm, but the secret movements centered on the Indian youth are expanding day by day. These young people have already made preparations, and as long as I give the order, they can start an uprising immediately.</p>
<p>Secondly, I want to point out that Britain's fighting spirit is very weak. When the Japanese army advanced into Myanmar in 1942, the British had secretly issued a retreat order. From this, you can see how the current Britain is. In short, once India intensifies, the Indian revolution will lead to secret movements, and great expectations are placed on the results of our National Army's campaign.

<p>Brief Biography of Mr. Ogura</p>
<p>Masatsune Ogura was born in Ishikawa Prefecture in March of the eighth year of the Meiji era.

<h3>Re-issuance of Residence Permits in District One Must Begin Next Month. Re-issuance Applications Are Being Submitted One After Another.</h3>
<p>Since the police substations and Baojia offices in District One (excluding the newly merged districts) began preparing for the re-issuance of residence permits in late last month, residents of various Baojia have been continuously submitting applications. According to reporters' inquiries from various offices, the re-issuance of residence permits must wait until the police authorities have completed the review of all the applications submitted by the residents before they can sequentially specify the dates and times for each Bao to collect them. Therefore, the official start of the re-issuance work should be after May 1st. At the same time, it was also learned that the re-issuance of residence permits in the West District did not start on April 10th, because the application procedures in that district have not yet started.</p>
<h3>Rice for Non-Local Residents in District One Will Be Sold Before the 20th</h3>
<p>The 38th term of grain rations for non-local residents in District One has been approved by the Municipal Food Bureau and has been fully allocated. It has been ordered that the public rice shops in each district under its jurisdiction must pay for the rice and take it out of the warehouse by next Monday at the latest. The public sales can be generally opened before the 20th. The 33rd term of flour rations will also be generally sold within days.</p>
<h3>Land Office Rectifies the Storage of Stolen Goods</h3>
<p>Shen Wenjie, the Chief Prosecutor of the Shanghai Local Procuratorate, received an order from the Ministry to rectify the stolen goods stored in the office's warehouse. Yesterday, he ordered the personnel of the stolen goods warehouse to strictly manage the stored stolen goods from now on. If there is any discrepancy in the quantity, it should be investigated and reported immediately. If there is any theft or shortage, severe punishment will be imposed according to the law.</p>
<h3>Two Police Stations Handle Coffin Transport Passports</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Government has stipulated that the First and Second Police Stations should handle the issuance of coffin transport passports after a person's death in the same way, and designated that the fee for each passport should be ten yuan, and should not exceed the regulation. Yesterday, it specifically ordered the two police stations to strictly comply with and handle the matter.</p>
<h3>Children Should Not Be Allowed to Go Out on Their Own to Avoid Being Abducted by Thugs</h3>
<p>Recently, the number of missing children in the city has been increasing. The Administrative Office of the First Police Station and the Children's Protection Section of the First District Office are very concerned about this, fearing that unscrupulous people may be acting up and abducting children to sell in other areas. Therefore, the Administrative Office of the First Bureau has ordered each substation to pay close attention, intensify inspections of hotels and land and water transportation stations, and strictly interrogate those with suspicious behavior. If any cases of abduction and sale of children are arrested, they will be severely punished. The Children's Protection Section of the District Office hopes that citizens will pay attention and not allow children to go out on their own to avoid being abducted by thugs. If a child is missing, they should report to the police substation in charge, and fill in the missing time, appearance, and clothing in detail to facilitate the search.</p>

<h3>Improving the Efficiency of Public Utilities</h3>
<p>— Nie Shi</p>
<p>The construction of modern cities depends heavily on the service efficiency of public utilities. Shanghai, as the largest city in China, has always been known for its developed public utilities. However, since the incident, due to the impact of the war and changes in the environment, the service efficiency of public utilities has gradually declined, and it is particularly severe today. What we have seen and heard can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Some are due to the wartime environment affecting efficiency, such as the panic of fuel and restricting electricity consumption, weakening the brightness of street lights for air defense, and affecting the operation of public vehicles due to restrictions on electricity and gasoline. There are also those who delay mail and telegrams due to military actions hindering the smooth flow of postal and electrical routes. However, these are all inevitable phenomena under wartime conditions, so let's not discuss them for now.</p>
<p>Some are deliberately neglecting service. We can cite examples that are commonly criticized by the general public: public military vehicles deliberately skip stops on the pretext of crowded passengers, even in non-crowded situations; water and electricity companies use the pretext of limiting electricity consumption to also limit water use, such as the French Water and Electricity Company; those responsible for delivering mail and telegrams use the excuse of being busy with private affairs and wartime conditions to deliberately delay, etc.</p>
<p>Some are using their positions to engage in malpractice. As is well known, the problem of ticket sellers on public vehicles skimming money has attracted public attention, and what is even more serious than the skimming problem is that today, employees of water and electricity companies, especially meter readers, accept bribes by falsifying records when consumption exceeds the limit. Today, the loss or shortage of a large number of mails, especially books and heavy parcels, is highly suspicious.</p>
<p>If we investigate the reasons for the above phenomena, in addition to wartime conditions that cannot be easily resolved, the biggest reason is that the living conditions of public utility service personnel are too difficult and their salaries are too meager. As far as we know, their average monthly salary is only a little over a thousand yuan. How can they solve the problem of supporting an average family of five or six people with this salary? No wonder there are various forms of malpractice. They spend their days racking their brains on how to engage in malpractice, not thinking about how to improve service efficiency. No wonder you can see many people wearing uniforms at stations and ports engaging in their own side businesses. They either take leave to do so or do it in their spare time, so the impact on service efficiency is self-evident. It is even less surprising that they cannot solve their living problems, cannot focus on service, and thus neglect service.</p>
<p>Therefore, we have to believe that adjusting the salaries of public utility service personnel is a prerequisite for improving service efficiency. Otherwise, if this continues, they may find other ways to make a living and scatter; or they may just barely cope, and things will get worse; or they may focus on their side business and be there only in name. Then the future of Shanghai's public utilities is simply unimaginable. On the other hand, the companies or bureaus concerned can imitate the First Police Station in organizing consumer cooperatives to reduce the burden on their colleagues. If the authorities concerned can take the initiative to launch and organize, powerful social organizations and people will be able to cooperate, just like the auxiliary police cooperative. We deeply hope that the bureaus concerned will consider the above points carefully.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we also hope that the municipal government and the authorities concerned of various public utilities will, within the possible scope, take the convenience of citizens as the premise and try their best to solve the difficulties. Such as dredging coal sources, in order to increase the electricity supply to meet the legitimate needs of citizens, increasing the brightness of street lights at night under the condition of not hindering air defense to improve the public security situation, and opening new postal and electrical routes in order to accelerate the delivery and transmission. At the same time, strictly warn service personnel not to make things difficult, neglect service, and engage in malpractice. Otherwise, they will be severely punished according to the law. Only in this way can the future of public utilities be promising.</p>
<h3>Sugar Allocation Institutions are Divided into Three Levels, Guided and Supervised by the Sugar Industry Association</h3>
<p>The Sugar Industry Professional Committee has now decided to divide the sugar allocation into three levels of institutions. Below the local sugar industry trade associations, the first level is the joint venture office, the second level is the wholesaler, which serves as the intermediary between the joint venture office and the retail stores, and the third level is the retail store that directly distributes to the residents. As for the sugar merchants' cooperative business office in Shanghai, in order to enhance the efficiency of allocation affairs, the Shanghai District Sugar Industry Association is responsible for guidance and supervision. At present, the allocation is divided into two types: ordinary (general public) and special allocation (for industrial and commercial use).</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Industry Sends Personnel to Shanghai to Supervise Industrial Production Increase, Starting with Match and Soap Factories</h3>
<p>In order to actively increase industrial production, stabilize people's livelihoods, and assist in the Greater East Asia War, the Ministry of Industry has specially dispatched five personnel, including Technical Supervisor You Yizhao, Counselor Hu Yu Shang, and Technical Officers Ren Letian, Wu Zhongda, and Qiu Jinyi, to Shanghai to handle the supervision of factories and make further efforts to increase industrial production. According to Technical Supervisor You's statement to reporters, "This time, we have been ordered to come to Shanghai, and we deeply feel that the task is heavy. We found that the current factory operations in this city are not on the right track. Large-scale manufacturers are unwilling to strengthen production due to the control of raw material consumption and strict price restrictions, while small factories have achieved abnormal prosperity because their manufactured goods can be supplied to the black market. It is necessary to make every effort to adjust this phenomenon. Minister Chen, in view of this, has specially dispatched us to be responsible for handling the supervision affairs, and plans to proceed gradually according to the established plan, starting with the match and soap manufacturing factories that are daily necessities. We have contacted the main personnel of the industry to supervise and strive to increase production to stabilize people's livelihoods," and so on.</p>
<h3>Financial, Industrial, and Commercial Market Conditions Last Week</h3>
<p>The financial, industrial, and commercial market conditions in Shanghai last week generally showed a trend towards a proper and stable state. Because the Ministry of Finance strictly prohibited the black market trading of financial instruments of enemy origin, the flow of proper capital became more lively, so the "redness" remained unchanged. The ratio of joint ventures, stock prices insisted on stability, monetary conditions remained as usual, and there was ample demand for proper funds. In industry and commerce, because the government strictly cracked down on hoarding and actively carried out agricultural and industrial production increase work, commodity prices seemed to have a lasting stability.</p>
<h3>Illegally Pledged Articles in District One are Suppressed by the Articles Valuation Association</h3>
<p>Illegally pledged articles in the South City have now unanimously stopped pledging and are waiting for redemption. Business is declining every day. It can be cleaned up in the short term. The illegally pledged articles in Taishan Road and other places in District One have recently become more rampant. Because they do not have a business license, they attempt to use the name of the "Articles Valuation Association" to obtain the approval of the authorities and continue to operate. It is heard that the company has applied to organize the Municipal Economic Bureau, and the Municipal Economic Bureau has paid strict attention to it. If what is said is indeed true, then this kind of disguised illegal pledge will never be allowed to open, in order to protect the livelihood of the poor and not be exploited by these people.</p>
<h3>Company Registration for Various Industries Ends at the End of April</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Industry previously stipulated that the re-registration of companies would end at the end of last November. Various companies have not been able to comply with the deadline to submit their requests, and have directly submitted their requests to the Ministry for re-registration. The Ministry, in consideration of the commercial situation, has made appropriate changes. Those who have been approved and registered by the former Ministry of Industry or the relevant competent authorities and issued licenses will still follow the procedures for company establishment registration and extend the deadline to the end of April in order to restrict them. Those who still fail to register before the end of April will be subject to appropriate penalties. Recently, in the past one or two months, seven companies have been established and opened in this city.</p>
<h3>Industry Associations Charge Fees for Handling the Movement of Materials</h3>
<p>Industry trade associations often feel that the income from membership fees is insufficient to cover expenses, and they have repeatedly requested to levy handling fees and administrative fees to make up for this. However, the various associations have limited income from fixed membership fees, and the handling of materials control affairs has increased and expenses have occasionally increased. For the sake of investigating the facts, the Business Consolidation Association has approved that the industry associations can charge 0.2% of the value of the controlled materials when handling the certification procedures for the movement of controlled materials in and out of the industry. Before the collection, each association should prepare a budget of income and expenditure and submit it for detailed review.</p>
