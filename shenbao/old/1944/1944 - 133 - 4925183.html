<p>社評</p>
<h3>論縣政</h3>
<p>中央政治是點，省區政治是綫，縣區政治是面。加强了點和錢，而忽略了面，那末，這個點和綫的力量，就不足以控制面的主宰而使之亦步亦趨。所以，我們全張强化縣區政治，應與强化中央及省區政治等量齊親，不可偏忽。</p>
<p>目前和平區內，縣區政治的現狀如何，縱不能概括謂爲「滿目瘡痍」，雖或有若干縣政「差強人意」，但利民不足而病民有餘者，實佔多數。這種既成現象，在熱　期待革新之際，不可　言的。我們知道，當國府還都之初，各地由「抗戰」區變為和平區，承地方戰亂之餘，過渡時期出而掌握地方政冶者，大多數非爲土豪劣紳，即係地痞流氓，而其目的原在趁火打劫，混水撈魚·其爲地方政治之士，挺身而出維持秩序者，誠是鳳毛麟角·常時上級政府以至中央政府，對於本身之組織，善後之處理，正感千頭萬緒，忙於應符，未　顧及縣區政治，而掌握縣區政治者天率擴張勢力，暢所欲爲。其間復有豪劣與痞流之火併鬥爭，攘奪地盤，結果此去彼來，老百姓遭盡池魚之殃·這些經過事實，久居都市者或未親身歷見，但原籍在和平區內之縣區者，必能知其概略。</p>
<p>其次，江北各縣，復有「新四軍」之蔓延，運用策略，以「小惠」爲爭取人民之工具，人民正處於水深火熱之中，驚魂甫定，睹此「小惠」，不免心旌搖動。况且，鄉區農民根本對於主義與信仰，不感興趣，惟求安居樂業，孰厭孰從，選擇之問，頗爲簡單，因之「新四軍」得以乘隙蔓延，而地方糜爛臼甚，人民痛苦亦日甚·</p>
<p>可是，國府還都，迄今己逾四年，巾央與省區政治，雖己逐漸確立戰時體制，逐漸向革新之途邁進，而對於縣區政治，尙未能平衡推進。我們認爲，欲求政治澈底革新，眞心革新，則對於縣區政治過去環境，必須透澈檢討　既不必　言弊病，更母須掩飾缺點，惟有坦白研究禍患之焦點，排除萬難，掃除阻礙。</p>
<p>縣區政治之革新，既與中央及省區同樣重要，而縣區政治之不良原因，復如上述。因此，我們主張革新縣政以人事爲先，次及制度，不　調整人事，縱有優良制度，也將成爲無靈魂的軀兗而己。縣政人事及制度加己健全，則於中央政令推行，自可收指臂之效·醫如收買軍米一事，不但不成問題，日亦不致病民了·</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭逐漸接近决勝階段，在此千鈞一髪之際，中國所處之地位。所應担當之任務，無疑是極關重要。換句話說，就是國民政府的領導責任愈益重要·近頃當局對於中樞及省市政治正圖革新，己有事實表現，我們猶感不足，必須全面革新，尤以縣政革新爲基礎，今天先就縣政之重要性及其竅敗癥結略買　見，至於調整人事及改革制度，容再申論之。</p>
<h3>對比先波爾猛攻　日印軍節節進展　馬猶河左岸滅戰激烈化</h3>
<p>東京十五日中央社電　據印緬前綫日軍某基地電：日。印同盟軍對比先波爾展開之攻勢，自得新銳部隊之增援後，全力愈益加强。該方面敵軍約二萬餘人，利用附近一帶之地形，從事構築陣地，連日正以所有之戰車，重砲，飛機等，作必死之防黎。日·印同盟軍則不分盡夜節節進展，其中由梅朗方面殺至通向比先波爾公路上之日軍，十日下午八時許與自鮑薩姆（比先波爾南方五公里）北方魁吉曼附近來襲之敵軍遭遇，當以至短距離互相對峙，是晚以戰車砲，擊毁敵P22型戰車兩輛，使之起火，更對自東北侵入之敵戰車，作肉搏攻擊，使之不能動轉，收獲赫赫戰果。</p>
<p>仰光十五日中央社電　印緬國境戰綫日軍，對於存馬猶河左岸地區蠢動中之英西非軍第八十一師第六旅所展開之殲減戰，自十日以來頓形激化。自塔溫丹其亞（達布爾岡北五里）附近開始行動之日軍有力部隊，擊潰該地敵軍，於十日夜半佔領塔溫丹其亞柬南方敵據點秦拉，刻仍繼續進行中。又於金旦地區追擊敗敵之日軍，已於十二日佔領金其安其亞（金旦北三公里），更與進至賓其安與賓拉附近之日軍相呼應，向某地進擊中。敵軍因自十日來失去空中補給，乃狼狽潰走，於半月前已完成包圍圈之臼軍各精銳，爲遮斷敵之退路，一舉將之殲減，正向密林地帶進擊中。</p>
<p>里斯本十五臼中央社電　據康堤來電，東南亞細亞軍司令部十四日發表謂：日軍已再度開始攻擊巴列爾東南方之震要丘陵。</p>
<h3>日大本營發表　轟炸遂川戰果　擊落敵戰鬥機七架</h3>
<p>東京十五日中央社電　巳大本營十五日發表（五月十五日下午二時四十分）：中國方面日空軍，以戰鬥轟炸機聯合編隊，迎續三次，轟炸在華美空軍前進基地遂川飛機塲，使敵主力潰滅，所獲戰果如下：擊落戰鬥機七架（三架未證實），擊毀及擊破大型機十二架以上，小型二十六架，共計四十五架以上。臼方損害自炸及米歸返者五架。</p>
<p>廈門十五日中央社電　日航空部隊轟炸機隊，十四日午前襲擊玉山及建　兩敵機場，冒敵方熾烈砲火，實行反覆轟炸，破壞其滑走路及其他軍事設施。日機於完成任務後，全部歸返。</p>
<p>漢口十五日中央社電　十一日下午，有敵北美式P51戰鬥機四架，襲擊揚子江岸湖北石首地方，日軍與之交戰，擊落其一架，其餘敗去，日方無損害。</p>
<p>漢口十五臼中央社電　活躍於洞庭湖一帶之駐渝美空軍，十四日九時十分，以戰鬥轟炸機聯合編隊，計北美B45型機二一架，P51型P40理機七架，來襲岳州北方二十餘公里處。日軍戰鬥機隊當對之迎擊，擊落B45型機二架，擊毁P40型機二架，使其潰走，日機安返基地</p>
<h3>緬甸調查團　參拜明治神宮</h3>
<p>東京十五日中央社電　緬甸特別調查團長巴亨博士一行，十五日午前赴明治神宮，　國神社參拜後，一時半赴首相官邸訪問，作抵京後之初次酬　。</p>
<h3>滿實施煤炭　緊急增產</h3>
<p>新京十五日中央社電　去年度滿洲國之煤炭生產，上半期雖有不振傾向，但七八兩月展開夏期增產運動後，已將所有一切夏季减產額補足，出煤量以月份計，增產比率較之過去三年已獲良好成績。及至九月，因大自然條件不佳，不能開採，或因工員不足等關係，故產量一時減少，縱以夏期增產實績補救，仍不能達於所定目標，結果上期終至全體不振，而下期因勞工遲延一時，增產仍屬用難，因此滿政府乃於十二月中句召開全滿煤礦長會議，並發出緊急增產非常命令，規定自十二月起，以一個月問爲冬季用煤緊急增產。增送期間當展開大增產運動，並派遣冬季煤礦激勵班予以激勵，一面講求生活必需物資等對策，結果該期間收獲驚人成續，今後之發展，尤堪期待</p>
<h3>菲律賓　服務團改組　阿齊諾任副總裁</h3>
<p>馬尼刺十五日中央社電　洛勒爾總統爲使菲律賓服務團負起一國一黨之重大使命，自純精神團體轉而爲政黨，以推進菲律賓之政治，前曾着手改組該團之機構，總統於十五日特任命前訪臼特使菲國會議長阿齊諾氏爲服務團副總裁兼事務總長，該團前副總裁奧西亞斯則專任敎育部長之職。按阿齊務副總裁自菲律賓服務團誕生後，即自內政部長轉任該團之副總裁，於最困難之時期，指導菲律賓之精神運動，築成該團之今日基礎，故阿氏實爲該團之保姆。今阿氏重返舊任，再就該團副總裁之職，以其東亞之政治思想及運用手腕，其對將來之成果，當可定評矣。菲律賓服務團乃菲律賓政治之核心，此次阿氏就任新職，實爲最得當者，又新敎育部迎。前以答禮使節訪問日滿之阿齊諾氏，奧西亞斯氏，分就重任，實爲菲律賓政府又進一步之强化也</p>
<p>伐爾　斯返國述職</p>
<p>馬尼刺十五日中央社電　菲駐日大使伐爾加斯，爲返國述職，十五日下午二時半偕女公子飛抵馬尼刺。菲財長阿拉斯隨行，阿氏前隨阿基諾特派大使抵日，於阿基諾大使返國後，曾繼續與日關係當局協商要務。</p>
<h3>河南渝軍戰敗　英美無法援助　英批評家論國共問題</h3>
<p>里斯本十五日中央社電　河南渝軍之慘敗對英美言論界最近所唱之「重慶再認識論」更予以最大刺激。十二日紐約泰晤士報，曾以「苦悶之重慶」爲題，特就此事論謂，若以現狀觀之，全面援蔣實不可能。其大意如次：渝府以河南之戰况有利爲理由，復行藉口要請英美援助，吾等對渝援助，固爲切要，然若以現狀觀之，則其援助實不得不受極度限制。渝府目前除作自力抗戰外，實無他策。渝府爲行自力抗戰，首應解除國共之鬥爭，此洵爲有效辦法，故願忠吿渝方，於戰爭總結前，亟應停止抗爭云。他方英軍事評論家魯爾運卡，亦就國共問題論述如次：渝軍因封鎖中共軍，致使自方抗戰力微弱，渝軍之不加力抗職，即於雲南國境方面情形而論，雲南省境五十萬大軍，對斯蒂維爾軍之緬甸作戰，竟行袖手傍觀，不予協力·際此不再開闢緬甸公路，即無法對渝補給之今日，渝軍雖啓口泣求美英援助，然對再開緬甸公路之美英軍，並不加以協力云。</p>
<p>各地民眾與日協力</p>
<p>東京十五日中央社電　日軍此次於河南平原展開之進攻作戰，其規模之宏大，與夫作戰之巧妙，於戰史上復添一劃期之一頁。此大陸職塲從來似僅限制於中日事變之範閣內，然現下大陸方面之臼軍，認淸孰爲東亞同胞，而崛起擊減英美。目下湯恩伯軍僅不過爲育目忠誠渝方之一集團，實則眞正之敵人乃爲英美。日軍在此種決意下，遂謀在河南平原展開進攻作戰，此際爲中國之命遝設想，渝方亦應醒悟前非，更應深自撿討，抗戰七年迄今之新事態。渝方雖勸告鄉州以次，京漢鐵路沿綫各領地民衆撤退，但彼等迄未首肯，而日軍軍紀復極嚴整，各該地屬民乃不惜與臼軍協力。及日軍佔領後，各地民衆自治自衛組織，即以當地有力者爲中心，順利推行一切事宜。並未與日軍發生何等糜擦。日軍非僅不以民衆無商，且更予以種種優待，因此一般民衆皆爭先恐後，與臼軍緊密提携，此實可謂此次作戰之最大收獲。日軍能於此次作戰中，把掃中國民衆心理，實與南方戰塲解放原居民之情形，如出一轍。此次作戰絕非破壞，乃係建設，並非排擊，乃屬擁護，此等事實若與現下混亂之渝方情形比較，即不難　知渝方軍事當局對此次日軍之作戰，並未測悉日軍之企圖，僅依揣測而行。並因指揮系統　亂，致使湯恩伯直系八個軍二十三個師團，完全陷於潰減，更於民國　七年，黃河爲渝潰决，屢與民眾以生死痛否。凡此種種事實，渝方雖似遺忘，然一般民衆始終牢記於心。黃河建設計劃最近即將由日軍協力實施，一般民眾皆大歡喜，日後必將與日軍同心協力，完成此偉大事業。</p>
<h3>襲拉巴爾敵機　墜毀二十架　日機炸荷蘭地亞敵陣</h3>
<p>拉巴爾十五日中央社電　敵戰鬥轟炸聯合編隊百七十六架，十二日來發拉巴爾，經駐在部隊迎擊後，敵機七架被擊落，五架被擊毁。日方損醫極爲輕微。又十三日，敵戰鬥轟炸聯合編隊約九十架，復來襲該地，經駐在部隊舉之空戰後，擊落其四架，擎毁四架，日方無損害。</p>
<p>東京十五日中央社電　日軍機隊曾於十二日拂曉，强襲新幾內亞島荷閑地亞，轟炸敵陣地後，全隊安返基地。</p>
<p>香港十五日中央社電　日軍艦艇隊，十二日午後於香港海面攻擊敵北美B25型轟炸機二架，襲落其一架。</p>
<h3>日駐華谷大使　昨飛抵東京　協商目前有關各問題</h3>
<p>東京十五日中央社電　日駐華大使谷正之，十五日下午搭機飛抵此間羽田機場，立即訪靑木大東亞相於官邸，旋廠自宅。谷大使此行將留東京約二週，就目前各有關問題與當局協商，預定於十六日下午二時，於大東亞省與青木東亞相，山本次官等首要進行協議。</p>
<h3>京各界追悼　島顧問</h3>
<p>南京十五日中央社電　全國即將委員會　島千春氏，於本月十日在京逝世後，各界聞訊，均同申哀悼，特組織治喪委員會，辦理　島氏之善後事宜，並於十五日下午五時，在西本願寺進行追悼會。到有中·日長官，我行政院院長汪兆銘（周隆　代）·溫宗　·周佛海（陳之碩代）·褚民　·陳君慧·張　·梅思平（袁愈佺代）·鄒敬芳·李謳一·姜佐宣·　盟邦谷大使代表小倉最高即將顧問，總軍司令部淵總參謀長，及　島氏生前友好等數日儈唱經禮懺，香烟繚　，至爲肅穆。次由我行政院秘書長周祥　，代表汪云張宣讀祭文。繼由盟邦谷大使小倉最高顧問宣請祭問，並由溫宗　開始以次　香致敬。最後由治喪委員會代表喪屬答謝，至六時許始畢。</p>
<h3>日強化國內體制　各區實施重點策　使綜合總力得儘量發揮</h3>
<p>東京十五日中央社電　爲支特長期作戰，强化國內體制起見，日本之「北海道」·「東北」·「關東」·「東海」·「北陸」·「近　」·「中國」·「四國」·「九州」等九地方，各有所謂地方行政協議會之組織，遞來迭次舉行會議，並召開中央協議會，巳將具體施政方針正式决定，刻已各就地方之特殊性，以中央移護之權限逐次推進實行。其强化國內體制之方策，在使綜合之總力得盡量發揮，使次戰施策圓滑推進，使防空以及其他直接影響戰爭遂行不可或非之各種施策，臻至完備，使之生產增多，使陸·海·空三方面之軍力增强。總之，在使國內一億氏衆精誠團結，以完遂戰爭。就各地區分別而觀，北海道地區與柬北地區，在增加農產。關東地區（包括東京）在加强農工商一切部門之生產。北陸地區，因該區爲重要港灣，特置重點於海上運輸及增加農產·近　地區以大阪·神戶爲中心，置重點於擴充軍需工業。中園·四　方面，置重點於增强海運·九州置重點於採礦製鐵等，均負有偉大之任務。</p>

<h3>妨害航運各措置　政院令一律取消　並飭屬防止各種不法私運</h3>
<p>南京十五日中央社電　華中方面一般船舶航行統制規稈實施以來，于整個之航運運營。收效硃宏。茲者我國政府當局爲期進一步確立戰時體制，改善航行，圓滑運輸，經與盟邦當局竭該協商，加以修正，自本月十五日起實行。行政院周副院長昨日發表談話，闡遠修正各要點，茲行政院現己通令所屬各省市政府，建設部，曁咨請軍專委員會查照，幷轉飭所屬一體遵照，明定凡足以妨害航運之各重措置，如未經呈准之各種捐稅等，應即一律取消，幷隨時嚴加取締。同時對于不合法令規定之各種私運，以及妨碍治安之各種航行，仍慼竭力防止，一體查照，從嚴懲處。</p>
<h3>渝空訓所學生　不滿美籍教官　帥生感情如同冰炭</h3>
<p>中央社訊　美在渝空軍爲補充軍力起見，特在民明·桂林兩地設立空軍訓練所，專事徵募渝方民衆，佯以受訓爲名，實則徒作犧牲。頃據由內地來人吿，對美在逾空軍所設之訓練所內容，侃述頗詳。且內部學生都不滿美籍敎官，雙方惑情如同冰炭。查該訓練所主特者，爲美在渝空軍第十四航空部隊琴諾德負責，去年九月間首在昆明設立，同時十二月間則在桂林設立。該來人對訓練所學生不滿敎官情形，特指出理由，計有五點：　美籍敎官對渝學生之態度頗爲高傲，且渺視異常。　訓練之標準較高，不適合渝學生程度。　訓練過於嚴格，在受訓時恒有受傷，甚致不幸跌斃。　訓練時間首期定爲六星期，終了後第二期繼續受訓，鴛駛訓練等各項拔術。惟因汽油缺乏關係，迄今不予新的訓練。同時受訓學生的粤桂籍實者爲最多，且彼輩對家鄉觀念頗深，氣量尤爲狹隘，如一旦感覺不滿時，敎官日常生活奢侈過甚，平日生活及行動，尤令人神秘莫測，對外則毫無交際，並秘密在桂林設立俱樂部，禁止華人參加更嚴禁學生入內。在昆明之俱樂部較小，如咖啡室類相同，該所學生對此等俱樂部之開設，亦難以滿意。詎美籍敎官因鑒於與學生之感情不良，乃要求渝方嚴禁學生此類行爲。結果渝方竟授種美人，如有違抗命令破壞紀律者，則予槍殺勿論。所方獲得此許可後，即佈吿學生週知云云。足見美人壓迫華人少行爲，及渝方之與敵美狼狽爲奸，令人齒恨。</p>
<h3>渝美幣行情　逐日昂騰</h3>
<p>中央社訊　據最近到達當地情報稱，重慶地區美幣之行情，逐日騰昂，渝方現正謀求對策，但其效果仍屬疑問。綠本年三月，孔祥熙視察昆明各地後，與記者會見時，曾聲明根絕外國紙幣暗盤交易，然而美幣之暗盤，仍然暴騰。依公定兌換率美一元兌廿元，然現在之暗盤，竟騰至二百卅兀。法幣之濫發亦甚驚人，法幣發行額，民國廿九年十二月爲卅億六千二百萬元，卅一年約爲二百十億至二百八十億元，卅二年四月爲五百四十億元，去年約爲七百億元，現在約可達一千億元。此種法幣之濫發，惟使民衆炭煤米之價格，約爲去年之六百倍，火柴爲戰前之六百倍，棉布爲三百四十倍，食油騰至一百七十倍。僑渝之外國人因物價之昂騰，亦受甚大影響。最近之外國記者常高呼生活之受威脅，於美國以美元可購之物品，於震慶地區即須法幣二百五十元。桂林之廣西日報，最近曾以外貨流通之市塲問題爲題，論述美幣流入之惡影響如下：現在之外賢，其猛如虎，各地之物費，全被壟斷。去年年末之美幣暗盤爲一比八十，兩閱月後爲一比一百六十元，現在爲一比二百二三十元，而且繼續昂騰不已。美幣之暗盤徒使法幣績落，美幣之流入，使中國永久立於殖民地之地位。關於此項問題，湖南日報亦論述如次：現在渝方治下之嶄新生活者，最希望就業於美國系之機關，亦即作買辨階級。例如在美系機關之寫鋼版者，每月亦可獲得一百美元，若以暗盤兌換可得二萬三千元，此項收入，較渝方之特任官吏尤多·而幣制之管理本不由中央直轄，不宜由奸商着手，政府負有責任，美人亦須負責。美幣之不絕流入，愈使重慶經濟混亂，且無收入之可能。</p>
<h3>華北組織　食糧公社</h3>
<p>北平十五日中央社電　華北政務委員會爲圓滑推進食糧政策，前會　設食糧之綜合統制機關，頃業經常務委員會通過華北食糧公社暫行規程。政委會情報局，以即將着手組織該公社，特於十五日發表如次：該公社爲置於農務總署監督下之特殊法人組織，分中央食糧公社，及地方食糧公社，中央食糧公社之資金爲一億圓，同時爲籌備運用資金，得發行食糧償券，此外，並於華北各省及北京·天津。靑島等地，設立地方食糧公社，其資金均各爲一千萬元。</p>
<h3>春圃任　粤新運會主委</h3>
<p>南京十五日中央社電　國府令，三十三年五月十五日，特派陳春圃爲新國民運動促進委員會廣東省分會主任委員，此令。主席汪兆銘。</p>
<p>中樞舉行週會週會，文官參軍兩處戰員，全體參加，彭參贊主席，行禮如儀，報吿國民黨創辦社會事業及其方法，十時四十分散會。</p>
<p>南京十五日中央社電　中央黨部十五日上午，舉行二〇一次紀念週，到六百餘人，諸秘書長民誼主席，行禮如儀，報告「東亞醫學會第三屆大會之經過」，十時餘散會。</p>
<h3>海部考試　十一期練兵</h3>
<p>南京十五日中央社電　海軍部爲造成海軍幹部人材，此次特招老第十一期練兵，及第一屆商船普通船負。招募以來，報名者極爲踴躍，已達數百名。茲悉該部定明（十七）臼上午八時，開始老試。地點南京方面在海軍部，各地區在原報名處。老試科目分　體格檢查，　；試，　筆試，國文測騐</p>
<h3>東南歐軸心盟邦　注視戰局推移　決與德攜手作戰到底</h3>
<p>布達佩斯十五日中央社電　關於義大利方面戰事，反軸心軍自十一日夜開始反攻後，德軍當即整備攻擊陣勢，巴爾幹方面各國亦認爲此或係英美登陸作戰之序冪，對其推移頗爲注視。關於英美企圖在東南歐作戰說，因斯達林艾登之會見，土耳其方面頗多留言，其所根據者約有下列數點：　地中海東部英美海軍之移動，　英美對東南歐各地之反覆轟炸，　英美對蒂托（南斯拉夫遊擊領袖）軍援助之增加，蒂托軍事使節及美國派訪蒂托使節團長馬克　兩人之赴倫敦，尤其最近美國又派軍事使節團駐蒂托軍本部。德軍自塞伐斯托波爾撤退後，關於蘇軍黑海作戰，亦發生種種流言，蘇軍大規換作戰準備尙夫完成，德軍亦增援新銳，防備蘇軍之進攻。又德軍對協力英美登陸作戰之蒂托軍，已於木月上旬開始大進攻，於波斯尼亞地方包國匪黨，現仍繼續掃蕩作戰，且蒂托軍之進攻亞得里亞海岸已被阻止，兵力亦漸減弱。現阿爾巴尼亞政府亦與德軍取得緊密協力，組織警備隊，協助德軍警備海峽，故東歐登陸之舉決非簡單事件也。且東南歐各國政府雖在反軸心軍之百般謀略及奇製轟炸下，仍願與德軍同生共死緊密協力，倘英美企圖登陸，彼等必能與德車共同展開攻防戰也。</p>
<p>德元首希特勒喚起國民注意</p>
<p>柏林十五日中央社電　就亞歷山大對全軍將士發出之激勵文觀之，知南義戰錢之大反攻，似即將展開，因此次攻勢爲攻歐第一步，頗引起世人注目。德元首行營以反軸心開始轟炸德佔領區，認係「登陸作戰之準備」而加以說明，　圖喚起國民注意。德當局自上月初旬復活節，即確認境內西方轟炸爲戰略轟炸，有戲更證明戰局之急迫。而德軍歷經四年完成之大西洋要塞綫，杷非一經轟炸即能摧毁消滅者。</p>
<h3>洪牙利軍　據險固守</h3>
<p>柏林十五日中央社電　在　巴　山前方陣地，紅軍一聯隊在古蒂（Kuty）對近進攻數次，均被擊退。台拉頓柯洛米亞（Deladyn-Kolomear）鐵路綫之南與北洪軍與蘇軍輸流互攻，直至最後洪軍將其陣地擴展至戰略上重要之一帶山脈，然後堅守此改善之陣地，而擊退蘇軍猛烈之反攻。</p>
<h3>克島軍完成撤退</h3>
<p>柏五日中央社電　克里米亞最後一批德軍之退至大陸，可視為德航運及空運隊之偉大成功，且德羅在黑海之船艦噸位爲數極少，在另一方面蘇海軍威力依然可畏，自四月起德軍戰具及平民之撤退即開始，蘇黑海艦隊及空軍迄未能予已嚴重之阻擾。</p>
<h3>瑞士決以武力　維護中立</h3>
<p>沮列克十五日中央社電　海通社訊：瑞士聯邦司法兼警務部長施達格昨稱，吾人今日問題，非助何方作戰，其唯一目標乃以武力維護中立，每一國民應準備不懈，拱衛國家嚴守中立，此乃自由國民之天責。</p>
<h3>歐陸大戰序幕　義南戰事增劇　卡西諾區德抵抗甚力</h3>
<p>柏林十五日中央社電　義境戰事自反軸心軍發動新攻勢以來已歷三日，除第勒尼安海沿岸地區，敵方出動兵力達十師之衆，規模較大外，其餘如納吐　等處，戰况雖亦劇烈，不出局部性質，且遭德軍堅强抗　，均無進展，刻下雙方空軍極度活躍，及海上交　　　，足爲大戰將臨之騷　。</p>
<p>柏林十五日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：第勒尼安海岸與卡西諾間戰鬥劇烈已達極度，亞歷山大將軍現以美第五軍與英第八軍共約十師團之衆大舉進攻，企圓向德軍主要陣地推進，德軍現按預定計劃，迫使英美聯軍主力陷入最大消耗戰中。由明土諾公路直達卡斯蒂爾福特之第勒尼安沿海區，德軍之抵抗更見緊張。</p>

<h3>日軍威脅下的　印渝補給路綫</h3>
<p>日軍的壓制場尼普爾平原，完全閉鎖了東亞大陸戰錢上英美的反攻。英美所企圖的第一，再侵略緬甸，逐漸向主要戰場移到中國的作戰。第二，在緬甸北部的一角確立補給綫，最短期間在中國出以攻勢，，都因此而全成泡影了。</p>
<p>先說第一項，再侵略緬甸的戰役，已脆弱地挫折了。再看第二項，敵人最近急於開　從印度阿薩密州東北部的萊杜經緬甸的新印渝公路，幷强化從頓斯基亞越喜馬拉耶山的空路。這無非表示阿薩密州這地域，對中國戰綫的補充上，占極重要的地位。且東亞大睦上敵方最大的補給地帶，是阿薩密州南隣的孟加拉州，其中心基地是加爾各答。這捕給地帶與阿薩密州東北部之問，沿阿薩密溪谷開闢了下面的四條聯絡綫：</p>
<p>鐵道</p>
<p>以加爾各答爲起點的東部印度鐵道之一支綫，從比哈爾州東行，在勃拉瑪普脫拉河南岸果哈獎接連阿薩密，孟加拉鐵道之支綫，這支綫在魯姆定運結從吉大港北上達頓斯基亞的本綫，並在頓斯基亞連結薩地亞·第普爾伽爾鐵道。第普爾伽爾是勃拉瑪普脫拉河上流最大的河港，萊杜就在這鐵道支線的終點。美陸軍鐵道技術部隊自三月一日起即啓理比哈爾州加奇哈爾與第普爾伽爾間七五〇哩的鐵道及二支線，隊長維爾遜少將並接管加爾各答的港務。從這些事實看來，阿薩密州東北部鐵道運輸的重點，在於以加爾各答爲起點北上，與勃拉瑪普脫拉河並行的一線。</p>
<p>水</p>
<p>阿薩密的水道，向恃勃拉瑪普脫拉河與蘇爾瑪河。現在補充運輸上可注意的是勃拉瑪普脫拉河。該河在上游第普爾伽爾與下游恒河交叉點的爪蘭特之間，內河汽船來往頻　，大型汽船則可通航至瓜蘭特。所以該河當然像戰前緬甸的伊拉瓦底河一樣，形成補充運輸上的重要路線。加爾各答港與上游的第普爾伽爾港同被美軍管理的原因，即在於此。</p>
<p>道路</p>
<p>除印緬國境附近迅急開闢的戰略道路外，以中央丘陵地帶的州應所在地希</p>
<p>倫爲中心的公路，向西方伸展。可注視的是沿勃拉瑪普脫拉南北岸的二條公路</p>
<p>空路</p>
<p>從加爾各谷飛機塲，經蘇爾瑪溪谷，中央丘陵地帶，而飛越阿薩密溪谷東北部，達頓斯基亞飛機塲。</p>
<p>以上四條路線中，鐵道·水道·公路均與嘉馬拉耶山南麗並行，距瑪尼普爾極近。日軍於四月六日佔領的哥希馬，距鐵道不過五〇公里，距勃拉馬普脫拉河不過一二〇公里。佔領哥希馬後向勃拉馬普脫啦溪進擊的日軍，使敵人感到直接的威脅。至於空路，祗要阿薩密東方富原馬尼普爾許多飛機場一歸日軍佔領，從其地裡的關係看來，當然也在日空軍的威脅之下。英美接通中國的國際路線，除此以外別無他路，而最精的將來亦沒有發現另外路線的可能。中國的反攻上所需要的物資，都不能不經過這地域。阿薩密溪谷一帶實可說是反軸心軍東亞大陸戰線上戰略的隘路口。對此，在北部緬甸的日軍曾履從空陸二方面甲乙激烈攻擊，大勢所趨，上述補給中心地帶及中途基地，即將頻於毀滅，而使敵人不能不爲之焦慮。（翔：譯自四月二十六日東京每日新聞）</p>

<h3>重視與輕視</h3>
<p>— 李允湛</p>
<p>讀「告大學應屆畢業生」後</p>
<p>讀五月十一日社評「告大學應屆畢業生」後，不禁使我茫然若失。雖然所提及的「敬。」「怨。」「勸」處世三階段，無非老生常談，但是詞顯意切，在昏天黑地荊棘遍地的人生歷程之初，得此良箴，末始不是本屆別野生的一個福音。更足以證明社會人士對於行將完成高等敎育的青年學生，並未忘懷。筆者現在某國立大學攻讀電機科，在未畢業之前，見到這份熱忱的精神上得重禮，感到無窮的愧恨與驚喜，因此不揣冒昧，就我在近兩年內所體會到的實際生活中，約略寫兩句。</p>
<p>無客諱言，一年一批大學畢業生由學校而進入社會，不能與社會上所得到的效果成正比例。但這是否即大學生被人輕視的主要原因？現在社會人士所重視的是什麽？却是一個疑問。記得在高中二的那年，同學史君，因不及格學科過多而未能升級，結果反以同等學力轉入某大學，讀經濟科，現在畢業已近兩年，肩上所在職務除銀號囊理，保險公司囊理以外，還做了某企業公司的負責人。所可怪的，不知那裏來許多空功夫，跳舞，又麻雀，吊　，亨京腔，差不多是日常功課。兩星期前在他的訂婚筵上，能不誇獎他年少英俊，才高八斗呢！他已博得社會人士的讚揚和青睞，追源溯本那某大學也就賴這後起之秀而增光不少。但是我私心忖度倒地社會人士尊重他的是那一部份呢？人品嗎？才幹嗎？學識嗎？……繼續的推想結果還是下意識地歸納到「金錢萬能」。這四個字包括整個的人生哲學，吃的是金錢，社會上重視的更是金錢。但是我敢斷言，小樓燈青，三年來埋頭苦讀，祗有指導我怎樣工作，沒有指導我怎樣做造鈔票機器。而且受過的敎育愈進深，對於金錢的慾望也愈湊薄，發財的機會愈不欲找尋，離開社會的現實也愈隔膜。假使社會的視點一天不轉變，我就一天不營營擾擾而要求社會重視。再進一層，甯願為社會輕視所窒息而死，切不可隨波逐流，因爭取重視而為金錢鷹犬。</p>
<p>在這個時代，敎育事業破產的程度，令人咋舌，戰前敎授，每星期授課十餘小時，月薪四五百元，生活優裕，因此可坐在實騐室圖館龍中，與學生孜孜不倦的討論。現在改觀了，敎授中有路的，合資經商，以敎書為副業，無路的每星期兼課達五十小時之多，東奔西跑，在生活的鞭策下喘息揮汗，試問還有多少時間預備明天的敎材，進修討論更不必談了。數十年前，他們不也是大學畢業生，或者還費了上萬的金錢，二三年的精力，得了一個博士學位，但是這空頭技能為他做些什麽呢。俗云「赫死　　餓死妻子」。年　啼飢，冬暖號寒，倒是一幅逼眞的寫照。社會上有議之士，雖然一再呼籲改善敎師待遇，但是這種近於憐憫的同情，沒有恢復大敎授已失的尊嚴，同時也鼓舞不起大衆的興趣。改善待遇，還是一段懸案。記得有一天，在某先生家中間談近况，那位先生深悔沒有把求學所費的錢財，收買金子，儲藏到現在，足衣足食那是毫無問題，弄得巧，坐上客常滿，　中　不空也並非不可能。唉！師道如此，學生的地位，更不必問，不堪問了。</p>
<p>講到大學平時敎育的情形，畢業程度的水準，我不敢武斷。因為以學校為比較的單位，已有寬嚴不等的情形：以學生為比較的單位，更上良莠不齊。但是詳細情形雖難下定論，至少缺乏向學興趣，忽略這德修養，那是事實。本來我們有龐大的校舍，精美的圖書館，完善的實驗室，遼闊的運動塲，一切都令人醉心和懷念，結果奇人　下，租了一座房子，勉强開課。學生除固定的聚散以外，討論·研究·參攷·咨詢·集會·聯誼等等，都成了過去名詞。每天　在書本上　營，得些不求甚解的死知識，這種生活，那得不索然無味呢？上海一隅，類似的學校，決不止我們一個，我所認識的同學，總算都肯聽受敎授的指導，在死書本中討生活；萬一有連書本都不惜一頭的同學，那末他們所受的四年大學敎育，將得到些什麽呢？再就出路問題而論，去年的畢業生中，祗有兩個被派到適宜的位置，其餘不是當敎員，便是做行員，推第員，學非所用，出非所學，國家化了大量的經費，培植專門人材，結果不能利用，甯不可惜。回想戰前每到畢業期近，三十個畢業生倒有六七十個位置待選，不覺令人寒心。社會輕視大學生，國家遺棄大學生，難道這是大學生的過失嗎？</p>
<p>不平則鳴，一鳴不覺言之過意，把「敬·怨·勸」處世三要者忘懷了，總之，社會輕視我們；我們輕視社會；那是已成的事實。往後的工作，並不是盲目地企求社會重視，而是打起全付精神，分析是否善惡，把我們參加後的社會，不再被下屆畢業生輕視。這樣大學畢業生才能被眞正德重視，才能被有意義的重視。</p>
<h3>松平部長發表感想</h3>
<p>臺中一帶本路交通。中　當局　與盟邦陸。海軍當局協商。多承竭力誠意協助，將華中方面一般船舶航行統制規程加以修正，業於昨（十五）日起正式實行，以是揚子江及內河之輪船。乃告自由通航。今後華中各地物資輸送，交流更為圓滑，日駐華大使館上海事務所松平情報部長，昨日下午三時在　例報道會席上，就此次華中水路自由通航事，向中國記者團發表感謝兩點：　强化物資交流，民生益為安定，今後糧食。麵貨以及農產物等執運輸，均得自由通暢。　華中各地之物資交流，今後益趨平衡，是以裨益民生良非淺詳。</p>
<h3>郭次長招待記者　談訪日感想　所見所聞印象殊深刻</h3>
<p>國府宣傳部次部長兼中央電訊社長郭峯氏，訪日任務完成返回，昨（十五）下午二時假　　飯店九樓舉行茶會，招待本市各報社以及同盟社，海通社，　國新聞社等記者五十餘人。郭次長偕中央電訊長副社長胡　洲，電務處長張昭銘，上海分設主任褐保衡等殷殷招待，首　上海分設主任褐保衡致詞介紹，當由郭次長發表此次訪日感想，幷介紹中央電訊社胡副社長與各報社記者會見，　答覆各報社記者提出之各項問題，旋共進茶點，迄四時始散。茲誌郭氏談話如此：</p>
<p>本人承蒙盟邦同盟通信社古野社長邀約，本月四日啟程赴日，七日抵東京，勾留四天，在日期間備蒙同盟通信社及各關係當局熱誠款待，實深感荷，所見所聞，印象尤為深刻，約言之如左：</p>
<p>盟邦國民信念堅決</p>
<p>盟邦國民義爭持神之强盛及必勝信念之堅決，殊非敵人之所能想及。余由福岡乘車東上時。從車窗遠望，看見盟邦國民不論男女長幼，各安本位，勤勞牽公，一切社會秩序，井井有條，　然見之，宛如平昔，而其情緒之熱烈，態度之嚴肅，工作之發展，則遍非平日之可比擬，可見盟邦國民對於完遂戰爭，具有充分之決心。</p>
<p>生產力量日益增强</p>
<p>盟邦軍需民需之生產力量，已隨戰爭之發展日益增强，當此決戰階段，就一般人之想像及敵人之慮為宣傳，每以為盟邦國民生活，或不免感受相當困難，其實情適與相反，盟邦實行記給制，統制周密，盟民日用所密，無不按其需要充分供給，生活至為安慰。</p>
<p>東亞前途充滿光明</p>
<p>盟邦實施封華新政策，改訂條約以來。積極援助我國完成獨立解放，此種政策，係經　議決定，已成為中日關係之最高準則，始終不渝。盟邦之以希望於中國者，為本於東亞人之立場，協力戰爭，早日完成獨立解放。此外，一無所求，期望之殷，談吐中歷歷可見，封重　自棄東亞立場，甘為英、美作倀，固不勝痛恨，亦深為惋惜。余此次訪日，期間甚短，所見難　有限，然所得印象殊為深刻，對於盟邦戰時各種設施，莫不深致敬佩，對盟邦國民決戰精神，日協力，完遂戰爭，必操左券，東亞前途，充滿無限光明。</p>

<h3>海軍</h3>
<p>— 岩田豐雄著　洪洋譯</p>
<p>一個最大的疑難，像畫畫一樣，在隆夫的心板上展開了。</p>
<p>取材華北和上海戰場的畫，充斥於展覽會裹，全都是合乎時代的作品，然而隆夫却毫無惑動於心。</p>
<p>（那樣畫，不行。）</p>
<p>雖然他這樣想，但他看到近處在有人畫一個大的盤子盛着水果這類作品，就會生氣的。</p>
<p>（這樣畫，也不行。）</p>
<p>日本無敵皇軍開始進攻廣東，新體制這一名詞，開始打入國民耳鼓時，而年靑且易受衝動的隆夫，前此的決心，就不能無所動搖於心。</p>
<p>於是他就不知道究竟畫好了。只是大大不滿於自己和周圍的現狀。</p>
<p>（究竟畫是什麼？美術是什麼？）</p>
<p>想到這一點時，就不想作文展出品了。</p>
<p>於是在他的鬱積糾結上，而又加上了根本的懊疑。所謂新愁舊恨，便交作起來。</p>
<p>（我想當畫家的動機，或許是不對的。）</p>
<p>所有的盡家因喜歡畫，而才成爲畫家。隆夫固然並不討厭畫，然而想當畫家，還是在兩次考試軍校不及格前，從未想過的事。</p>
<p>（我是打算反抗「海軍」，才想當賽家的）</p>
<p>聯想到了這個動機，結果就認爲自己太近於自暴自棄了。起碼可以說，並不是愛美而才當畫家的，這是很顯然的事。</p>
<p>（動機是不純潔的。所以現在才在受罰）。他這樣解　自己。</p>
<p>於是，一切都深深地沉入絕望的萬丈深淵了。自己發現了常畫家的前途，和晋京來的拼命努力，全都成了空。一切的顏面和希望，完全棄如敝　。</p>
<p>（眞人，的確令人羨慕！）</p>
<p>從來沒有　近來這樣羨慕眞人。他像自己的事情一樣，很準確地知道，眞人還有一年就要畢業了。既然是眞人的事情，所以他在心裏鼓舞着眞人在江田島的生活。他在等待着，不久後眞人取得榮耀的海軍士官階級。與此相對照，而自巳却成了一飼失敗者。是二十歲的失敗者，這是如何可惜！</p>

<h3>On County Administration</h3>
<p>Central politics is a point, provincial politics is a line, and county politics is a surface. If the point and the line are strengthened while the surface is neglected, then the power of the point and the line will not be sufficient to control the surface and make it follow suit. Therefore, we advocate strengthening county politics to the same degree as strengthening central and provincial politics, without neglecting either.</p>
<p>What is the current state of county politics in the peaceful areas? Although it cannot be generally described as "a scene of devastation," and some county administrations may be "passable," the majority are more harmful than beneficial to the people. This established phenomenon is undeniably lamentable at a time when reform is eagerly anticipated. We know that when the National Government returned to its capital, various areas transformed from "war zones" to peaceful areas. After the local war, those who emerged to control local politics during the transitional period were mostly either local tyrants and evil gentry or local ruffians, and their purpose was to take advantage of the chaos and muddy the waters. Those who stood up to maintain order as local political figures were truly rare. At that time, the higher-level governments and even the central government were overwhelmed with countless issues regarding their own organizations and post-war arrangements, and were too busy to attend to county politics. Those who controlled county politics naturally expanded their power and did as they pleased. In the meantime, there were also struggles and infighting between tyrants and ruffians, vying for territory. As a result, the common people suffered the consequences. Those who have lived in the city for a long time may not have personally experienced these events, but those whose ancestral home is in a county within the peaceful areas will surely know the general picture.</p>
<p>Secondly, in various counties north of the Yangtze River, there was the spread of the "New Fourth Army," which used tactics of "small favors" as a tool to win over the people. The people were in dire straits and their minds had barely settled. Seeing these "small favors," they could not help but waver. Moreover, rural farmers are fundamentally uninterested in doctrines and beliefs, only seeking to live and work in peace. Which to dislike and which to follow? The question of choice is quite simple, so the "New Fourth Army" was able to take advantage of the opportunity to spread, and the local situation became increasingly corrupt, and the people's suffering also increased day by day.</p>
<p>However, more than four years have passed since the National Government returned to its capital. Although the central and provincial politics have gradually established a wartime system and are gradually moving towards reform, county politics has not been able to advance in a balanced manner. We believe that if we want to thoroughly reform politics, to truly reform, then we must thoroughly review the past environment of county politics. There is no need to mince words about the ills, nor is there any need to conceal shortcomings. We must honestly study the focus of the troubles, overcome all difficulties, and eliminate obstacles.</p>
<p>The reform of county politics is as important as that of the central and provincial areas, and the reasons for the shortcomings of county politics are as described above. Therefore, we advocate that personnel should be the first priority in reforming county administration, followed by the system. Without adjusting personnel, even if there is an excellent system, it will become a soulless husk. If county administration personnel and systems are sound, then the implementation of central government orders will naturally achieve the effect of fingers and arms. For example, the issue of purchasing military rice will not only not be a problem, but it will also not harm the people.</p>
<p>As the Greater East Asia War gradually approaches the decisive stage, China's position and the tasks it should undertake at this critical moment are undoubtedly extremely important. In other words, the leadership responsibility of the National Government is becoming increasingly important. Recently, the authorities have been planning to reform the central and provincial politics, and there have been concrete manifestations, but we still feel that it is not enough, and that comprehensive reform is necessary, especially county administration reform as the foundation. Today, we will first briefly discuss the importance of county administration and its key problems. As for adjusting personnel and reforming the system, we will discuss them later.</p>
<h3>Comparing the Fierce Attack on Bishenpur, Japanese and Indian Troops Advance Steadily, Fighting Intensifies on the Left Bank of the Mayu River</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from a certain base of the Japanese army on the Indo-Burmese front: The offensive launched by the Japanese and Indian allied forces against Bishenpur has become increasingly strengthened with the reinforcement of new troops. The enemy forces in that area, numbering more than 20,000, are making use of the surrounding terrain to construct fortifications and are making a desperate defense day after day with all their tanks, heavy artillery, and aircraft. The Japanese and Indian allied forces are advancing steadily day and night. Among them, the Japanese army that advanced from Meilang to the highway leading to Bishenpur encountered enemy forces coming from the vicinity of Kegeiman (five kilometers south of Bishenpur) north of Bausam on the afternoon of the 10th at about 8:00 pm. They engaged each other at close range. That night, they used tank guns to destroy two enemy P22 tanks, setting them on fire. They also launched a close-quarters combat attack on enemy tanks that invaded from the northeast, immobilizing them and achieving remarkable results.</p>
<p>Rangoon, 15th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese army on the Indo-Burmese border front has intensified its annihilation campaign against the British-West African Army's 81st Division's 6th Brigade, which is moving in the area on the left bank of the Mayu River, since the 10th. A strong Japanese force that began operations near Tawondan Kethia (five miles north of Thabulgon) defeated the enemy forces in that area and occupied the enemy stronghold of Qinla south of Tawondan Kethia on the night of the 10th, and is still continuing its operations. In addition, the Japanese army, which pursued the defeated enemy in the Jintan area, occupied Jin Kian Kethia (three kilometers north of Jintan) on the 12th, and is coordinating with the Japanese army that advanced to the vicinity of Bin Kian and Bin La to attack a certain place. The enemy forces, having lost air supply since the 10th, are fleeing in disarray. The elite Japanese troops, who had completed the encirclement circle half a month ago, are cutting off the enemy's retreat and annihilating them in one fell swoop, and are advancing into the dense forest area.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from Conti, the Southeast Asia Military Headquarters announced on the 14th that the Japanese army had again begun attacking the vital hills southeast of Ba Lieer.</p>
<h3>Announcement by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters: Results of the Bombing of Suichuan, Seven Enemy Fighters Shot Down</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - The Imperial Headquarters announced on the 15th (May 15th, 2:40 pm): The Japanese Air Force on the China front, using joint formations of fighter-bombers, bombed the forward base of the U.S. Air Force in China, the Suichuan airfield, for three consecutive waves, annihilating the enemy's main force. The results achieved are as follows: Seven fighter planes shot down (three unconfirmed), more than twelve large planes destroyed and damaged, and twenty-six small planes, totaling more than forty-five planes. The Japanese side lost five planes that exploded and did not return.</p>
<p>Xiamen, 15th (Central News Agency) - A Japanese Air Force bomber squadron attacked the enemy airfields of Yushan and Jian'ou on the morning of the 14th, carrying out repeated bombings despite the enemy's fierce artillery fire, destroying their runways and other military facilities. The Japanese planes returned safely after completing their mission.</p>
<p>Hankou, 15th (Central News Agency) - On the afternoon of the 11th, four enemy North American P51 fighter planes attacked the area of Shishou, Hubei, on the bank of the Yangtze River. The Japanese army engaged them, shooting down one plane, and the rest fled. The Japanese side suffered no damage.</p>
<p>Hankou, 15th (Central News Agency) - The U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing, active in the Dongting Lake area, attacked more than twenty kilometers north of Yuezhou at 9:10 am on the 14th with a joint formation of fighter-bombers, totaling twenty-one North American B45 planes and seven P51 and P40 fighter planes. The Japanese fighter squadron engaged them and shot down two B45 planes and destroyed two P40 planes, causing them to flee in disarray. The Japanese planes returned safely to base.</p>
<h3>Burmese Investigation Team Visits Meiji Shrine</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - Dr. Ba Heng, head of the Burmese Special Investigation Team, and his entourage visited the Meiji Shrine and Yasukuni Shrine on the morning of the 15th. At 1:30 pm, they visited the Prime Minister's official residence for the first courtesy visit after arriving in Tokyo.</p>
<h3>Manchukuo Implements Emergency Coal Production Increase</h3>
<p>Xinjing, 15th (Central News Agency) - Although coal production in Manchukuo last year showed a declining trend in the first half of the year, after the summer production increase campaign was launched in July and August, all the summer production reduction was made up for. The increase in coal output, calculated by month, has achieved good results compared to the past three years. By September, due to unfavorable natural conditions, mining was not possible, or due to insufficient workers, etc., the output temporarily decreased. Even with the summer production increase performance, the set target could not be reached. As a result, the first half ended up being generally sluggish, and the increase in production in the second half was still difficult due to the delay of labor. Therefore, the Manchukuo government convened a full Manchukuo coal mine director meeting in mid-December and issued an emergency production increase order, stipulating that from December onwards, one month would be used for the winter coal emergency production increase. A large-scale production increase movement was launched during the increased delivery period, and winter coal mine encouragement teams were dispatched to provide encouragement. At the same time, countermeasures such as providing essential living materials were discussed. As a result, the period yielded amazing results, and future development is even more anticipated.</p>
<h3>Philippines Service Corps Reorganized, Aquino Appointed Vice President</h3>
<p>Manila, 15th (Central News Agency) - President Laurel, in order to make the Philippine Service Corps shoulder the important mission of one country and one party, transforming it from a purely spiritual organization into a political party to promote Philippine politics, had previously begun reorganizing the organization of the corps. On the 15th, the President specially appointed former special envoy to the United States and Speaker of the Philippine Congress, Aquino, as Vice President and Secretary-General of the Service Corps. The former Vice President of the Corps, Osias, will now serve exclusively as the Minister of Education. According to reports, Vice President Aquino, since the birth of the Philippine Service Corps, has transferred from Minister of the Interior to Vice President of the Corps, guiding the spiritual movement of the Philippines during the most difficult period and building the foundation of the corps today. Therefore, Aquino is truly the "nanny" of the corps. Now that Aquino has returned to his old post and re-assumed the post of Vice President of the Corps, with his East Asian political thought and operational skills, his future achievements can be definitively evaluated. The Philippine Service Corps is the core of Philippine politics. This time, Aquino's assumption of his new position is the most appropriate. In addition, the new Minister of Education, Mr. Osias, who previously visited Japan and Manchukuo as a delegation, and Mr. Aquino, who assumed important positions, are further strengthening the Philippine government.</p>
<p>Vargas Returns Home to Report on His Duties</p>
<p>Manila, 15th (Central News Agency) - The Philippine Ambassador to Japan, Vargas, returned to the country to report on his duties, arriving in Manila at 2:30 pm on the 15th with his daughter. Philippine Finance Minister Aralas accompanied him. Mr. Aralas had previously accompanied Special Envoy Aquino to Japan. After Ambassador Aquino returned to the country, he continued to negotiate important matters with the relevant Japanese authorities.</p>
<h3>Defeat of the Chongqing Army in Henan, Britain and the United States Unable to Provide Assistance, British Critic Discusses the Kuomintang-Communist Problem</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency) - The disastrous defeat of the Chongqing army in Henan has given the greatest stimulus to the "rethinking of Chongqing" recently advocated by British and American commentators. On the 12th, the New York Times published an article entitled "Distressed Chongqing," specifically discussing the matter, saying that given the current situation, full-scale aid to Chiang Kai-shek is impossible. The gist is as follows: The Chongqing government is using the situation in Henan as a reason to request aid from Britain and the United States, and we are, of course, essential to aid Chongqing, but given the current situation, aid must be extremely limited. The Chongqing government currently has no other option but to resist on its own. To conduct self-reliant resistance, the first thing is to resolve the struggle between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. This is an effective way, so I would like to faithfully advise Chongqing to stop the resistance before the end of the war. The British military commentator Roel Unca also discussed the Kuomintang-Communist problem as follows: The Chongqing army's blockade of the Communist army has weakened its own resistance. The Chongqing army's failure to increase its resistance force is evident from the situation on the Yunnan border. The 500,000 troops in Yunnan Province are standing by and watching the Stilwell army's operations in Burma, without providing assistance. At a time when the Burma Road cannot be reopened, and it is impossible to supply Chongqing, even though the Chongqing army is crying out for aid from the United States and Britain, it is not cooperating with the American and British forces to reopen the Burma Road.</p>
<p>Local People Cooperate with the Japanese Army</p>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - The large scale and skillful operation of the Japanese army's offensive in the Henan Plain has added another landmark page to the history of war. The mainland theater has always seemed to be limited to the scope of the Sino-Japanese Incident, but now the Japanese army on the mainland is clearly recognizing who are East Asian compatriots and rising up to strike down Britain and the United States. At present, the Tang Enbo army is only a group loyal to Chongqing, but the real enemy is Britain and the United States. Under this determination, the Japanese army is planning to launch an offensive in the Henan Plain. At this time, thinking about the fate of China, Chongqing should also wake up to its past mistakes and deeply examine the new situation after seven years of resistance. Although Chongqing advised the people of the townships and villages along the Beijing-Hankou Railway to evacuate, they have not yet agreed. The Japanese army has extremely strict discipline, and the local people are willing to cooperate with the Japanese army. After the Japanese army occupied the area, the local people's autonomous self-defense organizations smoothly promoted all matters with local influential people as the center. No friction occurred with the Japanese army. The Japanese army not only did not despise the people, but also gave them all kinds of preferential treatment. Therefore, the general people scrambled to cooperate closely with the Japanese army. This can be said to be the biggest gain of this operation. The Japanese army's ability to sweep through the minds of the Chinese people in this operation is exactly the same as the situation of liberating the original residents in the southern theater. This operation is not destruction, but construction; it is not rejection, but support. If these facts are compared with the current chaotic situation in Chongqing, it is not difficult to know that the military authorities in Chongqing did not understand the intentions of the Japanese army in this operation, and only acted based on speculation. Due to the chaotic command system, Tang Enbo's eight divisions and twenty-three divisions were completely wiped out. In the Republic of China Year _, the Yellow River was breached by Chongqing, causing repeated pain and suffering to the people. Although Chongqing seems to have forgotten all these facts, the general people always remember them in their hearts. The Yellow River construction plan will soon be implemented with the cooperation of the Japanese army, and the general people are very happy. In the future, they will surely work together with the Japanese army to complete this great undertaking.</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Attacking Rabaul Shot Down Twenty, Japanese Planes Bomb Enemy Positions in Hollandia</h3>

On the 13th, an enemy joint formation of fighter-bombers numbering about ninety attacked the area again. After an aerial battle by the stationed troops, four were shot down and four were destroyed. The Japanese side suffered no damage.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - Japanese air squadrons attacked Hollandia in New Guinea Island at dawn on the 12th, bombing enemy positions. The entire squadron returned safely to base.</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 15th (Central News Agency) - A Japanese warship squadron attacked two enemy North American B25 bombers in the waters off Hong Kong on the afternoon of the 12th, shooting down one.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ambassador to China, Mr. Tani, Arrived in Tokyo Yesterday to Discuss Current Relevant Issues</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Ambassador to China, Tani Masayuki, arrived at Haneda Airport by plane on the afternoon of the 15th.

<h3>Memorial Service for Advisor Shima Held by Various Circles in Nanjing</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency) - After Mr. Shima Chiharu of the National Preparatory Committee passed away in Beijing on the 10th of this month, all circles were saddened to hear the news. A funeral committee was specially organized to handle Mr. Shima's funeral arrangements, and a memorial service was held at Nishi Honganji Temple at 5:00 pm on the 15th.

Next, Zhou Xiang _, Secretary-General of our Executive Yuan, read the eulogy on behalf of Wang Yunzhang. Then, Allied Chief Advisor Ogura of the Gu Zuigao Committee recited a memorial speech, and Wen Zong _ started to offer incense and pay respects in order. Finally, the representative of the funeral committee thanked the bereaved family, and it ended at about 6:00 pm.</p>
<h3>Japan Strengthens Domestic System, Each Region Implements Key Policies to Maximize Comprehensive Strength</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - In order to support long-term operations and strengthen the domestic system, the nine regions of Japan, including "Hokkaido," "Tohoku," "Kanto," "Tokai," "Hokuriku," "Kinki," "Chugoku," "Shikoku," and "Kyushu," each have an organization called the Regional Administrative Council, which has held repeated meetings and convened a central conference. Specific policy guidelines have been officially decided and are being gradually promoted and implemented in each region, based on its specific characteristics and with the powers delegated by the central government. The strategy to strengthen the domestic system is to maximize comprehensive strength, smoothly promote secondary warfare policies, perfect air defense and other measures that directly affect the execution of the war, increase production, and enhance the military strength of the land, sea, and air forces. In short, it is to unite the 100 million people of the country in sincerity to complete the war. Looking at each region separately, the Hokkaido and Tohoku regions are focused on increasing agricultural production. The Kanto region (including Tokyo) is focused on strengthening production in all sectors of agriculture, industry, and commerce. The Hokuriku region, because it is an important port, places emphasis on maritime transport and increasing agricultural production. The Kinki region, with Osaka and Kobe as its centers, places emphasis on expanding the munitions industry. The Chugoku and Shikoku regions place emphasis on strengthening maritime transport. Kyushu places emphasis on mining and iron production. They all bear great responsibilities.</p>

<h3>All Measures Impeding Shipping are Cancelled by Order of the Executive Yuan, and Subordinates are Instructed to Prevent Various Illegal Smuggling Activities</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency) - Since the implementation of the General Regulations for the Control of Navigation of Ships in the Central China region, they have had a significant effect on the overall navigation and operation of ships. Now, in order to further establish a wartime system, improve navigation, and streamline transportation, our government has discussed and revised them with the relevant allied authorities. They will be implemented from the 15th of this month. Deputy President Zhou of the Executive Yuan issued a statement yesterday, elucidating the main points of the revision. The Executive Yuan has now issued a general order to the provincial and municipal governments under its jurisdiction, the Ministry of Construction, and requested the Military Affairs Committee to take note, and instructed its subordinates to abide by it. It is clearly stipulated that all measures that impede navigation, such as various taxes that have not been approved, should be cancelled immediately, and strict measures should be taken at any time to crack down on them. At the same time, all illegal smuggling activities and various navigation activities that hinder public order, which are not in accordance with legal regulations, should still be vigorously prevented and strictly punished in accordance with the law.</p>
<h3>Students at the Chongqing Air Force Training School Dissatisfied with American Instructors, Relationship Between Instructors and Students is Like Ice and Charcoal</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report - In order to replenish its military strength, the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing has specially established air force training schools in Kunming and Guilin, specializing in recruiting people from Chongqing, ostensibly for training, but in reality only to make sacrifices. According to a person who recently arrived from the mainland, the contents of the training schools established by the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing are described in detail. Moreover, the students inside are dissatisfied with the American instructors, and the relationship between the two sides is like ice and charcoal. It has been found that the person in charge of the training school is Chinode, who is responsible for the 14th Air Force Unit of the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing. It was first established in Kunming in September last year, and in Guilin in December of the same year. The person pointed out the reasons for the students' dissatisfaction with the instructors, including five points: 1. The American instructors' attitude towards the students from Chongqing is very arrogant and exceptionally dismissive. 2. The training standards are relatively high and not suitable for the level of the students from Chongqing. 3. The training is too strict, and injuries often occur during training, even fatal falls. 4. The first phase of training is scheduled for six weeks, and after the end, the second phase continues to receive training, including various driving training techniques. However, due to the lack of gasoline, no new training has been given so far. At the same time, most of the trainees are from Guangdong and Guangxi, and they have a deep sense of their hometown and are particularly narrow-minded. Once they feel dissatisfied, the instructors' daily life is too extravagant, and their daily life and actions are particularly mysterious, with no communication with the outside world, and they secretly set up clubs in Guilin, prohibiting Chinese from participating and even strictly prohibiting students from entering. The club in Kunming is smaller, like a coffee room. The students at the school are also dissatisfied with the establishment of such clubs. It is said that the American instructors, seeing the poor relationship with the students, asked Chongqing to strictly prohibit students from this type of behavior. As a result, Chongqing granted the Americans the right to shoot and kill anyone who violated orders and broke the rules, regardless of whether they were guilty or not. After the school obtained this permission, it was announced to the students. This shows the Americans' oppression of the Chinese people and the collusion between Chongqing and the enemy Americans, which is hateful.</p>
<h3>Chongqing's US Currency Exchange Rate Rises Daily</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report - According to recent information arriving from the area, the exchange rate of US currency in the Chongqing area is rising daily. Chongqing is currently seeking countermeasures, but the effectiveness is still questionable. As early as March of this year, after Kong Xiangxi inspected various places in Kunming, he stated at a meeting with reporters that he would eradicate the black market trading of foreign paper currency. However, the black market for US currency is still skyrocketing. According to the official exchange rate, one US dollar is exchanged for 20 yuan, but the current black market rate has soared to 230 yuan. The excessive issuance of legal currency is also very alarming. The amount of legal currency issued was 3.062 billion yuan in December 1940, approximately 21 billion to 28 billion yuan in 1942, 54 billion yuan in April 1943, approximately 70 billion yuan last year, and is now estimated to reach 100 billion yuan. This excessive issuance of legal currency has caused the prices of coal, rice, and other commodities to be approximately 600 times that of last year, matches to be 600 times that of before the war, cotton cloth to be 340 times, and edible oil to soar to 170 times. Foreigners in Chongqing are also greatly affected by the rising prices. Recently, foreign reporters have often cried out that their lives are threatened. Items that can be purchased for one US dollar in the United States require 250 yuan in legal currency in the Chongqing area. The Guangxi Daily in Guilin recently published an article entitled "The Problem of the Foreign Goods Circulation Market," discussing the adverse effects of the inflow of US currency as follows: The current foreigners are as fierce as tigers, and the prices of goods everywhere are completely monopolized. At the end of last year, the black market rate for US currency was 1 to 80, two months later it was 1 to 160 yuan, and now it is 1 to 220 or 230 yuan, and it continues to rise. The black market for US currency only makes the legal currency continue to fall. The inflow of US currency makes China permanently stand in the position of a colony. Regarding this issue, the Hunan Daily also discussed as follows: The new livers under Chongqing's rule are most hopeful of being employed in American-related organizations, that is, working as compradors. For example, a person who writes steel plates in an American-related organization can also earn 100 US dollars per month. If exchanged at the black market rate, this can be 23,000 yuan, which is more than that of a specially appointed official in Chongqing. The management of the currency system is not directly under the central government, and should not be handled by unscrupulous merchants. The government has a responsibility, and the Americans must also be responsible. The constant inflow of US currency is making the Chongqing economy more chaotic, and there is no possibility of revenue.</p>
<h3>North China Organization: Food Corporation</h3>
<p>Peiping, 15th (Central News Agency) – In order to smoothly promote the food policy, the North China Political Affairs Commission previously decided to establish a comprehensive control organization for food. Recently, the interim regulations for the North China Food Corporation were passed by the Standing Committee. The Information Bureau of the Political Affairs Commission announced on the 15th that it would immediately begin organizing the corporation, stating the following: The corporation is a special legal entity under the supervision of the Agricultural Affairs Department, divided into the Central Food Corporation and local food corporations. The capital of the Central Food Corporation is 100 million yuan. At the same time, in order to raise and manage funds, it may issue food bonds. In addition, local food corporations will be established in various provinces of North China and in Beijing, Tianjin, Qingdao, and other places, each with a capital of 10 million yuan.</p>

<h3>Axis Allies in Southeastern Europe Monitor the Transition of the War Situation; Determined to Fight to the End Hand in Hand with Germany</h3>
<p>Budapest, 15th (Central News Agency) – Regarding the war in Italy, after the anti-Axis forces launched a counteroffensive on the night of the 11th, the German army immediately prepared for attack. The countries of the Balkans also believe that this may be the prelude to the Anglo-American landing operation and are paying close attention to its development. Regarding the Anglo-American attempt to wage war in Southeastern Europe, many rumors are circulating in Turkey following the meeting between Stalin and Eden. The rumors are based on the following points: 1. The movement of Anglo-American naval forces in the eastern Mediterranean; 2. The repeated Anglo-American bombing of various parts of Southeastern Europe; 3. The increased Anglo-American aid to Tito's (Yugoslav guerrilla leader) forces; and the visits to London by Tito's military envoys and Mark, the head of the American delegation to Tito. In particular, the United States has recently sent a military mission to Tito's headquarters. Since the German army withdrew from Sevastopol, various rumors have also arisen regarding the Soviet army's Black Sea operations. The Soviet army's large-scale war preparations have not yet been completed, and the German army has also reinforced with fresh troops to prepare for the Soviet offensive. Furthermore, the German army launched a large-scale offensive against Tito's forces, which are cooperating with the Anglo-American landing operation, in early May, surrounding the bandits in the Bosnia region. The mop-up operation is continuing, and Tito's army's advance to the Adriatic coast has been blocked, and its strength is gradually weakening. Currently, the Albanian government is also closely cooperating with the German army, organizing a security force to assist the German army in guarding the straits. Therefore, a landing in Eastern Europe is by no means a simple matter. Moreover, although the governments of Southeastern European countries are subject to all kinds of schemes and strange bombings by the anti-Axis forces, they are still willing to closely cooperate with the German army in life and death. If the Anglo-Americans attempt to land, they will certainly be able to launch an offensive and defensive war together with the German army.</p>
<p>German Leader Hitler Calls for National Attention</p>
<p>Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) – Judging from the exhortation issued by Alexander to all officers and soldiers, it is known that the great counteroffensive on the southern Italian front seems about to begin. Since this offensive is the first step in attacking Europe, it has attracted worldwide attention. The German leader's headquarters explained that the anti-Axis bombing of German-occupied territories is considered a "preparation for a landing operation," in order to call for national attention. Since the beginning of Easter in early May, the German authorities have confirmed that the bombing in the western part of the country is a strategic bombing, which further proves the urgency of the war situation. However, the Atlantic Wall, which the German army spent four years completing, cannot be destroyed and eliminated by bombing alone.</p>
<h3>Hungarian Army Holds Firm in Dangerous Terrain</h3>
<p>Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) – On the Carpathian front, a regiment of the Red Army attacked Kuty several times but was repelled. South and north of the Deladyn-Kolomear railway line, the Hungarian and Soviet armies attacked each other in rotation until the Hungarian army finally extended its position to a strategically important mountain range, then held firm in this improved position and repelled the fierce Soviet counteroffensive.</p>
<h3>Crimean Forces Complete Retreat</h3>
<p>Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) – The retreat of the last German troops from Crimea to the mainland can be regarded as a great success for the German shipping and air transport units. Moreover, the German tonnage of ships in the Black Sea is extremely small, while the power of the Soviet Navy remains formidable. The withdrawal of German war materials and civilians began in April, and the Soviet Black Sea Fleet and Air Force have so far failed to seriously obstruct it.</p>
<h3>Switzerland Determined to Maintain Neutrality by Force</h3>
<p>Zurich, 15th (Central News Agency) – The Swiss Federal Minister of Justice and Police, Stager, said yesterday that the question for us today is not which side to help fight, but our only goal is to maintain neutrality by force. Every citizen should be prepared to defend the country and strictly maintain neutrality, which is the duty of free citizens.</p>
<h3>Prelude to the Great European War: Intensified Fighting in Southern Italy; German Resistance in the Cassino Area is Strong</h3>
<p>Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) – Three days have passed since the anti-Axis forces launched a new offensive in the Italian theater. Except for the Tyrrhenian coast, where the enemy deployed a force of ten divisions, the situation in other places such as Naturno, although also fierce, is not of a local nature. Moreover, the German army is resisting strongly, and there is no progress. At the moment, the air forces of both sides are extremely active, and naval exchanges are also frequent, serving as an ominous sign that a major war is about to break out.</p>
<p>Berlin, 15th (German News Agency) – According to German news agencies, the fighting between the Tyrrhenian coast and Cassino has reached an extreme level. General Alexander is now launching a large-scale offensive with the US Fifth Army and the British Eighth Army, totaling about ten divisions, in an attempt to advance towards the main German positions. The German army is now forcing the main forces of the Anglo-American coalition into a war of attrition according to a pre-determined plan. German resistance is even more intense in the Tyrrhenian coastal area, which extends from the Minturno highway to Castelforte.</p>
<p>Berlin, 15th (German News Agency) – According to German authorities, the anti-Axis forces in southern Italy resumed their offensive yesterday with maximum strength. After fierce fighting, the enemy lost 50 tanks in just one location south of Cassino. Most of the German troops moved west a few kilometers and retreated to pre-arranged positions.</p>
<p>Naples Suffers Heavy Air Raids</p>
<p>Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) – German heavy bombers launched a large-scale air raid on the port of Naples yesterday morning. The German planes attacked in several waves, starting at 3:20 AM, dropping bombs on ships and docks in the port. Five minutes later, two major fires broke out, accompanied by violent explosions. Another transport port was hit and exploded, and the fire illuminated the entire city.</p>
<p>Naval Battle in the English Channel</p>
<p>Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) – On the eve of the previous day, several engagements occurred between German and British light fleets in the English Channel. Around midnight, several German torpedo boats sailed towards the British coast and shelled British destroyers, hitting their targets. The British ships returned fire ineffectively. At the same time, a British torpedo boat was attacked by the German navy off the Dutch coast, one British boat caught fire, and several boats were heavily damaged. At around 3:00 AM on Sunday morning, a British torpedo boat attacked a German patrol fleet with torpedoes off Dieppe but missed. Soon after, another British torpedo boat team appeared off Cape Hague but released a smokescreen and fled without engaging.</p>
<h3>Attlee Hints at Imminent Major War; British King Inspects Fleet</h3>
<p>Swiss Capital, 15th (Anglo-Chinese News Agency) – Labor Minister Attlee said in a speech to a public gathering in Birmingham yesterday that the British Empire will experience its greatest battles in the coming months.</p>
<p>Swedish Police, 15th (Central News Agency) – It was announced in London last night that the British King's four-day inspection of the domestic fleet along the northern coast of the British Isles has been completed.</p>
<h3>Ambassador to Manchukuo Chen Jicheng Returns to Post</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency) – Our Ambassador to Manchukuo, Chen Jicheng, has completed his report to the country and will return to his post at 4:00 PM this afternoon with his entourage. Many people saw him off.</p>
<h3>Costa Rica Resumes Relations with the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency) – According to a report from Mexico, Soviet Ambassador to Mexico, Umansky, declared that the Soviet Union has restored diplomatic relations with Costa Rica.</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Sends Congratulatory Telegram on the Inauguration of the New Croatian Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency) – Alabinović, the newly appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Independent State of Croatia, took office. Today (the 15th), he sent a special telegram to our Foreign Minister Chu Minyi to express his regards. Minister Chu immediately sent a telegram of congratulations.</p>
<h3>The India-Burma Supply Route Under Japanese Threat</h3>
<p>The Japanese army's suppression of the Imphal Plain has completely closed off the Anglo-American counteroffensive on the East Asian mainland front. The Anglo-American attempts to first, re-invade Burma and gradually shift the main battlefield to China, and second, to establish a supply line in a corner of northern Burma and launch an offensive in China in the shortest possible time, have all been shattered.</p>
<p>First, the re-invasion of Burma has been weakly thwarted. Looking at the second point, the enemy is recently eager to open the new India-Burma Road, which runs from Ledo in northeastern Assam, India, through Burma, and to strengthen the air route from Tinsukia over the Himalayas. This undoubtedly indicates that the Assam region plays an extremely important role in supplementing the Chinese front. Moreover, the largest enemy supply zone on the East Asian mainland is Bengal, south of Assam, and its central base is Calcutta. This supply zone and northeastern Assam are connected by the following four communication lines along the Assam Valley:</p>
<p>Railway</p>
<p>One branch line of the Eastern Indian Railway, which starts in Calcutta, runs eastward from Bihar and connects Assam on the south bank of the Brahmaputra. A branch line of the Bengal Railway connects this branch line in Lumding, running north from Chittagong to Tinsukia, and connects the Saikhoa-Dibrugarh railway in Tinsukia. Dibrugarh is the largest river port on the upper reaches of the Brahmaputra, and Ledo is at the end of this railway branch line. Since March 1, the US Army Railway Technical Corps has been repairing 750 miles of railway and two branch lines between Katihar in Bihar and Dibrugarh. Major General Wilson, the corps commander, has also taken over the port operations in Calcutta. From these facts, the focus of railway transportation in northeastern Assam is on the line starting from Calcutta and heading north, running parallel to the Brahmaputra.</p>
<p>Waterways</p>
<p>Assam's waterways rely on the Brahmaputra and Surma rivers. Currently, the Brahmaputra is noteworthy for its supply transport. Inland steamers frequently travel between Dibrugarh in the upper reaches and Goalundo, where it intersects the Ganges River in the lower reaches, and large steamers can navigate to Goalundo. Therefore, this river naturally forms an important route for supply transport, just like the Irrawaddy River in Burma before the war. The reason why Calcutta Port and Dibrugarh Port in the upper reaches are both managed by the US military lies in this.</p>
<p>Roads</p>
<p>In addition to the strategic roads that have been rapidly opened near the India-Burma border, the highway centered on Shillong, the state capital of the central hilly area, extends westward. Of note are the two highways along the north and south banks of the Brahmaputra.</p>
<p>Air Routes</p>
<p>From the Calcutta airport, passing through the Surma Valley and the central hilly area, and flying over the northeastern part of the Assam Valley, reaching the Dibrugarh airport.</p>
<p>Among the four routes above, the railway, waterway, and highway all run parallel to the southern edge of the Himalayas, very close to Manipur. Kohima, which was occupied by the Japanese army on April 6, is only 50 kilometers from the railway and 120 kilometers from the Brahmaputra River. The Japanese army's advance towards the Brahmaputra Valley after occupying Kohima posed a direct threat to the enemy. As for the air route, as long as the many airports in Manipur, east of Assam, are occupied by the Japanese army, it will naturally be under the threat of the Japanese air force given their geographical relationship. The Anglo-Americans have no other international routes to connect with China besides this, and there is no possibility of discovering other routes in the best of times. The materials needed for China's counteroffensive must all pass through this area. The Assam Valley area can be said to be the strategic bottleneck on the anti-Axis forces' East Asian mainland front. In response, the Japanese army in northern Burma has launched fierce attacks from both the air and land. The trend is that the aforementioned supply centers and midway bases will soon be destroyed, causing the enemy to be anxious. (Translation by Xiang from the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun, April 26th)</p>

<h3>Emphasis and Neglect</h3>
<p>— Li Yunzhan</p>
<p>After Reading "A Message to University Graduates"</p>
<p>After reading the May 11th editorial "A Message to University Graduates," I couldn't help but feel lost. Although the mentioned three stages of dealing with the world – "respect," "resentment," and "persuasion" – are nothing more than clichés, the words are clear and the meaning is earnest. At the beginning of life's journey, which is full of darkness and thorns, receiving such good advice can be considered a blessing for this year's graduates. It further proves that society has not forgotten young students who are about to complete higher education. I am currently studying electrical engineering at a national university. Before graduating, I feel immensely ashamed and surprised to receive such respect. Therefore, I dare to share my experiences from the past two years.</p>
<p>Without mincing words, each year, a batch of university graduates enters society, but the results achieved are not directly proportional to the efforts put in. Is this the main reason why university students are looked down upon? What does society value now? That is the question. I remember in my second year of high school, a classmate, Mr. Shi, failed too many subjects to be promoted. As a result, he transferred to a university with equivalent qualifications to study economics. Now, almost two years after graduation, besides being a manager at a bank and an insurance company, he has also become the head of a certain enterprise. Strangely, he seems to have a lot of free time for dancing, mahjong, opera, and speaking in a Beijing accent, which are almost daily activities. Two weeks ago, at his engagement banquet, everyone praised him for being young, handsome, and talented! He has won the praise and favor of society, and the university he attended has gained some glory from this rising star. But I wonder, which part of him does society respect? His character? His talent? His knowledge? Continuing my train of thought, I subconsciously concluded that "money is omnipotent." These four words encompass the entire philosophy of life. Money is what people eat, and it is what society values. But I dare say that these past three years of burning the midnight oil have only taught me how to work, not how to create a money-making machine. Moreover, the deeper the education received, the weaker the desire for money, the less willing one is to seek opportunities to get rich, and the more isolated one becomes from social realities. If society's perspective does not change, I will not seek society's respect through petty gains. Furthermore, I would rather be suffocated to death by society's neglect than follow the crowd and become a money-grubbing lackey in order to gain respect.</p>
<p>In this era, the bankruptcy of the education system is shocking. Before the war, professors taught more than ten hours a week and earned four to five hundred yuan a month, which allowed them to live comfortably. Therefore, they could sit in the laboratory or library and discuss diligently with students. Now, the situation has changed. Professors with connections invest in business and treat teaching as a side job. Those without connections teach up to fifty hours a week, running around and panting for breath under the whip of life. How much time do they have to prepare for tomorrow's teaching materials, let alone further study and discussion? Decades ago, they were also university graduates, or even spent tens of thousands of yuan and two or three years of effort to obtain a doctorate degree. But what does this empty skill get them? As the saying goes, "A scarecrow dies of fear, and his wife starves to death." The year-end cries of hunger and the winter roars of cold are a true depiction. Although enlightened people in society have repeatedly called for improving the treatment of teachers, this kind of pitying sympathy has not restored the lost dignity of professors, nor has it inspired the public's interest. Improving treatment is still a pending issue. I remember one day, while chatting with a certain gentleman about recent events, he deeply regretted not using the money spent on his education to buy gold and store it until now. He would have no problem with food and clothing, and if he played his cards right, it would not be impossible to have a constant stream of guests and a never-empty wine cup. Alas! If the way of teachers is like this, then the status of students need not be asked, it is unbearable to ask.</p>
<p>Speaking of the state of education at universities and the level of graduates, I dare not make a definitive judgment. Because when comparing schools, there are different levels of strictness; when comparing students, there is even more uneven quality. But although it is difficult to draw a conclusion on the specific situation, the lack of interest in learning and the neglect of moral cultivation are facts. Originally, we had large school buildings, beautiful libraries, perfect laboratories, and vast sports fields, all of which were intoxicating and memorable. As a result, someone pulled strings and rented a house to barely start classes. Besides the fixed gatherings and dispersals, discussions, research, reference, consultation, meetings, and gatherings have all become terms of the past. Every day, they slave away over books, gaining some poorly understood dead knowledge. How can this kind of life not be boring? In Shanghai, there is definitely more than one school like this. The classmates I know are willing to listen to the professor's guidance and make a living from dead books; if there are classmates who do not even bother with books, then what will they gain from their four years of university education? Furthermore, concerning the issue of career prospects, among last year's graduates, only two were assigned to suitable positions. The rest were either teachers or clerks, working in positions unrelated to their studies. The country spent a lot of money to cultivate specialized talents, but in the end, they cannot be utilized, which is a pity. Thinking back to the time before the war, when graduation was approaching, there were sixty or seventy positions waiting to be chosen by thirty graduates, which is disheartening. Society despises university students, and the country abandons university students. Is this the fault of the university students?</p>
<p>Unable to bear the injustice, I cannot help but speak out. I forgot the three essential aspects of dealing with the world: "respect, resentment, and persuasion." In short, society despises us, and we despise society. That is an established fact. The work ahead is not to blindly seek society's respect, but to muster all our energy to analyze whether things are good or evil, so that the society we participate in will no longer be despised by the next generation of graduates. Only then can university graduates be truly respected, and meaningfully respected.</p>
<h3>Minister Matsudaira Expresses His Thoughts</h3>
<p>Regarding traffic on this route in the Taichung area, the authorities in Chongqing consulted with the Allied land and naval authorities. With their utmost sincerity and assistance, the general regulations for ship navigation in Central China have been revised and officially implemented yesterday (the 15th). As a result, ships on the Yangtze River and inland rivers can now navigate freely. This will make the transportation and exchange of materials in various parts of Central China smoother. Minister Matsudaira of the Information Department of the Japanese Embassy in China's Shanghai Office expressed two points of gratitude to the Chinese press corps at a regular press conference at 3 PM yesterday regarding the free navigation of waterways in Central China: 1. Strengthening the exchange of materials will further stabilize people's livelihoods. In the future, the transportation of food, flour, agricultural products, and other essential goods will be free and unobstructed. 2. The exchange of materials in various parts of Central China will become more balanced, which will greatly benefit people's livelihoods.</p>
<h3>Vice Minister Guo Receives Reporters and Discusses His Impressions of His Visit to Japan: What He Saw and Heard Left a Deep Impression</h3>
<p>Guo Feng, Vice Minister of the Department of Propaganda of the National Government and President of the Central Telegraph Agency, returned after completing his visit to Japan. Yesterday (the 15th) at 2 PM, he held a tea party on the ninth floor of the hotel to receive more than fifty reporters from various newspapers in the city, as well as from the Allied News Agency, Haitong News Agency, and the Chinese News Agency. Vice Minister Guo, accompanied by Deputy President Hu of the Central Telegraph Agency, Director of the Telegraph Department Zhang Zhaoming, and Director of the Shanghai Branch He Baoheng, warmly greeted the guests. First, Director He Baoheng of the Shanghai Branch delivered an introductory speech, followed by Vice Minister Guo's speech about his impressions of his visit to Japan. He also introduced Deputy President Hu of the Central Telegraph Agency to the newspaper reporters and answered various questions raised by the reporters. Afterwards, tea and snacks were served, and the event ended at 4 PM. The content of Mr. Guo's speech is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>I was invited by Mr. Furuno, President of the Allied News Agency, and set off for Japan on the 4th of this month. I arrived in Tokyo on the 7th and stayed for four days. During my stay in Japan, I was warmly received by the Allied News Agency and relevant authorities, which I am deeply grateful for. What I saw and heard left a particularly deep impression on me, which can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>The Allied People's Belief is Firm</p>
<p>The Allied people's unwavering faith in maintaining the strength of the divine and their determination to win is something that the enemy cannot imagine. When I was traveling east from Fukuoka by train, I looked out the window and saw the Allied people, regardless of gender or age, faithfully performing their duties. All aspects of social order were well-organized. Seeing this, it was just like normal times, but the enthusiasm of their emotions, the seriousness of their attitude, and the development of their work were far beyond what they were like in peacetime. It is evident that the Allied people have full determination to complete the war.</p>
<p>Production Capacity is Increasing</p>
<p>The Allied military and civilian production capacity has been increasing with the development of the war. At this crucial stage of the decisive battle, based on general imagination and enemy propaganda, it is often thought that the Allied people's lives may be experiencing considerable difficulties. However, the reality is the opposite. The Allied countries have implemented a rationing system with thorough controls. The daily necessities of the people are fully supplied according to their needs, and their lives are very comfortable.</p>
<p>The Future of East Asia is Full of Light</p>
<p>Since the Allied countries implemented the new policy towards China and revised the treaties, they have been actively assisting our country in completing its independence and liberation. This policy was decided by the cabinet and has become the highest principle of Sino-Japanese relations, which will not change. What the Allied countries hope from China is that, based on the position of East Asians, we will cooperate in the war and achieve independence and liberation as soon as possible. Beyond that, there is nothing else they seek. Their earnest expectations are evident in their words. As for the Chongqing government abandoning the East Asian position and willingly acting as a henchman for Britain and the United States, we cannot help but feel hatred and deep regret. My visit to Japan was very short, and what I saw was limited, but the impressions I gained were very deep. I deeply admired the Allied countries' various wartime measures. I believe that with the Allied people's spirit of decisive battle and our daily cooperation, we will surely win the war, and the future of East Asia is full of unlimited light.</p>
<h3>City Public Bonds: Redemption Lottery Held Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Public Bond redemption lottery was held for the second time at 10 AM yesterday on the fifth floor of the Banking Association. It was conducted by the Municipal Finance Bureau in conjunction with the Fund Custody Committee. Representatives from the Central Reserve Bank, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Banking Associations, the Fuxing Bank, and others were present to supervise the execution of the lottery. The five winning numbers drawn were 10, 22, 25, 53, and 78. The total amount of principal and interest to be paid in this period is 785,000 yuan. It is scheduled to be paid by the Central Reserve Bank or the Fuxing Bank starting at the end of this month.</p>
<h3>Police Consumer Cooperative: Promoting Cooperative Affairs</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the First Police Bureau Police Consumer Cooperative in this city, it has received assistance from various sectors in terms of funding, reaching more than 20 million yuan. The cooperative affairs are being actively promoted by specialists assigned by the bureau. They have now begun to conduct surveys of cooperative members' families, printing forms that have been distributed to all police officers, who are required to fill them out truthfully within a specified period for review. This is to accurately calculate the number of dependents, so that the evaluation, purchase, and distribution of daily necessities can be carried out as soon as possible, improving the lives of police officers and promoting the efficiency of police work.</p>
<h3>Report on Donations to Subsidize Teachers and Staff</h3>
<p>Mr. Bao Guochang donated 20,000 yuan. President of the Shenzhong Foreign Hospital, Tang Xinghai, Chi Xijia, Huang Zhendong, Yang Runlin, Yang Huazhai (jointly), Huang Yuyi, Ding Fangyuan, all teachers and staff of the private Yanghua Elementary School, Shao Baosheng, Rong Hongyuan, and Rong Hongsan (jointly) each donated 12,000 yuan. Huang Daoguo, Xu Jianping, and Pu Peiting submitted donations of 4,000 yuan each from the gentlemen of Beigongji.

Hu Jiageng and Xu Yongzuo each donated 1,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The above totaled 178,000 yuan, bringing the total received to 767,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Iron Gates on North Sichuan Road and Other Roads Have Been Completely Removed</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Japanese-language "Continental News" reported: The twenty-seven iron gates on North Sichuan Road, Wujin Road (Jizi Road), and other sections have been completely removed as of yesterday (the 14th). Each iron gate was compensated at the current price, totaling around 100,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Municipal Education Association Distributes Rubber Shoes to Teachers and Staff</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Education Association has been distributing rubber shoes to teachers and students of member schools for several days now. Most of the distribution has been completed. However, the original number of small-sized rubber shoes from various factories is not enough to distribute, and they are currently rushing to produce more, which will be completed and delivered to the schools soon. Staff will be sent to various schools starting today to conduct surveys.</p>

<h3>Assisting Impoverished Mothers: Launching an Obstetric Aid Movement; Hoping for Generous Donations from Enthusiastic Individuals</h3>
<p>Given the current high cost of living, most poor women cannot afford proper and reasonable midwifery when they are about to give birth. This often leads to dangers for both the mother and the child, which has a significant impact on national fertility. Therefore, we are launching a movement to assist impoverished mothers. Poor pregnant women can apply for registration with our office one month before their due date. If the investigation confirms their eligibility, approval will be granted. If it is a normal delivery, a midwife doctor will be sent to the mother's home to assist with the delivery, with the expenses borne by our office. If there are complications during delivery, hospitalization will be approved, and the hospitalization and medical expenses will be borne by our office. At the same time, the midwife doctor will provide guidance on the mother's pre- and post-natal hygiene, as well as infant care. We have also contacted various hospitals, who have agreed to cooperate.</p>
<p>This initiative is not only charitable in nature but also related to the nation and the people. We earnestly hope that enthusiastic individuals in society will generously donate to support this cause.</p>

<h3>Navy</h3>
<p>— By Iwata Toyoo, translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>A major doubt, like a painting, unfolded on Ryufo's mind.</p>
<p>Paintings depicting the North China and Shanghai battlefields filled the exhibition, all of which were works in keeping with the times, but Ryufo was unmoved.</p>
<p>(That way of painting is no good.)</p>
<p>Although he thought so, he would get angry when he saw someone nearby painting works like a large plate filled with fruit.</p>
<p>(This way of painting is also no good.)</p>
<p>When the invincible Imperial Japanese Army began its offensive in Guangdong, and the term "new system" began to enter the ears of the people, Ryufo, who was young and easily impulsive, could not remain unmoved.</p>
<p>So he didn't know what was good to paint. He was simply very dissatisfied with himself and the surrounding situation.</p>
<p>(What exactly is painting? What is art?)</p>
<p>When he thought of this, he didn't want to submit anything to the Art Exhibition.</p>
<p>Thus, on top of his accumulated frustration, he added fundamental doubt. So-called new sorrows and old hatreds intertwined.</p>
<p>(Perhaps my motivation for wanting to be a painter is wrong.)</p>
<p>All painters became painters because they liked painting. Ryufo certainly didn't dislike painting, but the thought of becoming a painter never occurred to him until after he failed the military academy entrance exams twice.</p>
<p>(I wanted to rebel against the "Navy," that's why I wanted to become a painter.)</p>
<p>Associating this motive, he came to think that he was too close to self-abandonment. At least it could be said that it was clearly not out of a love for beauty that he became a painter.</p>
<p>(The motive is impure. That's why I'm being punished now.) He explained it to himself this way.</p>
<p>Thus, everything sank deeply into the abyss of despair. He realized that his future as a painter and the desperate efforts he had made since coming to Beijing had all been in vain. All the face and hope had been discarded like worn-out shoes.</p>
<p>(Makoto is truly enviable!)</p>
<p>He had never envied Makoto as much as he had lately. He knew as accurately as if it were his own affair that Makoto was about to graduate in a year. Because it was Makoto's affair, he encouraged Makoto's life at Etajima in his heart. He was waiting for Makoto to obtain the glorious rank of naval officer soon. In contrast, he had become a failure. A twenty-year-old failure, how regrettable!</p>
