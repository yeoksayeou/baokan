<p>社評</p>
<h3>樹立文官制度</h3>
<p>我們主張澄淸吏治，建議考選和銓叙，更主張樹立文官制度。在一般人看來似乎都是些責生之見，迂闊之論。可是，這些都是平時早就應當做到的，因爲平時未曾做到，所以戰時大受影響。假如戰時還躊躇滿志而不勇往直前去做到，那末，戰爭的勝利是無從獲取的。我們所以時時不憚詞費，不避忌諱，危言直陳，根木的原因就在於此。</p>
<p>文官制度就是事務官制度，是現代政治上最好的結晶。事務官是整個政治中最基本的部份，一切日常行政事務可說完全由事務官執行。政務領袖決定大政方針之後，其餘可不必顧問，而全部委託事務官去執行，所以事務官是直接執行政事的人，他們對於國民或許還比政務官更為重要。文官制度的建立，目的在選拔優秀人材，執行事務，保障其生活安定，職們穩固，其要點有三：　文官任用，必經考試。　文官生活，必須安定。　文官去留，不受政潮影響。文官必經考試，可使任何人不能够援用私人，位置私黨。公開的競爭考試，更可以選拔賢才，使有才學的人都有自進的機會。文官必須經過考試，嚴格考試及格的必定是優秀份子。就以中國論，公務人員數量至少進步。</p>
<p>要使文官廉潔，先要使文官生活安定，所謂「衣食足而後知禮義」，是人類共通的道理。文官是直接和國民發生關係的人，如果他們因爲生活不安定而貪汚，則受害的自然是直接的老百姓，但是這個「任用非人」的責任是應當由政府來負，而不容推諉的。關於保障公務人員生活的問題，我們已經說過很多，最近對於上海市的警察生活，我們更建義政府不能立刻有辦去之前，先由民間竭力協助。如合作社的設立，民間應當盡力墊款，促其成功，政府應　先籌款，歸還民間，而警察本身，應十分廉正，替老百姓服務，這才是「官民合作」的表率。</p>
<p>文官是終身職業，所以應當不受政潮影響。文官制度的樹立可以打破「一朝天子一朝臣」的風氣，使優秀人才不用鑽謀，不必請託，而把本身的才能，本身的道德，本身服務的成績，做他終身的保障。這一點在現前政務官員去留不定的時候，更是重要。政務官隨本身道德才具和民衆情調而變更，是當然的事。假如事務官亦是去留無定，整個政家必定大亂，老百姓更是受害不淺。所以文官不受政潮所左右，是保障優秀文官終身服務。</p>
<p>我們中國數十年來，一般人大都注意於政務方面，而很少注意於事務，更有人認為事務是書記胥吏的工作而不屑為。至於怎樣培植事務人才，怎樣保障，當然也談不到。我們必須認淸，文官制度不樹立，平時的政治不能上軌道，那未，應付戰時，比較共他國家，自然亦「相形見絀」了。我們希望政府應加以嚴切注意。</p>
<h3>日印軍繼續猛攻　梅朗敵向北撤退　前綫印兵投國民軍者日衆</h3>
<p>仰光十八日中央社電　梅朗西南方隘路口周圍之攻防戰，自十四日夜半至十五日黎明，戰况已益趨激烈，敵軍因受日印軍各部隊之猛攻，已將特爾本西南方丘陵地區之陣地放棄，並已由第一陣綫向後撤退，現正與戰車爲主力之應援部隊，據守第二陣綫，繼續抵抗中。一方於十，四日黎明，敵軍曾以重砲野砲對日軍行猛烈之盲目砲擊，計一晝夜中發射砲彈竟達一萬發之多，日軍對此亦曾以砲火向敵軍陣地行進備之砲擊，故於狹窄之梅朗綫陣地，一時曾充滿雙方悽壯之砲聲。又敵軍於自第一綫退却之同時，曾於附近村落放火焚燒，以阻止日印軍之追擊，待至十五日夜半，敵重砲陣地終不堪日軍之猛攻，而開始向後移動，並於十六日黎明以飛機掩護，使殘餘之砲兵及戰車隊向梅朋北方逃遁，日印軍各部隊此時認爲時機已至，遂一舉向已動搖之敵地殺入，於是數日來敵軍始終堅持之梅朗，即於日印軍各部隊之猛攻下，歸人日印軍之掌握中　　緬甸前綫基地十八日中央社電　日印軍在加拉頓方面開始總攻擊後，承地擊潰英國非軍，刻已繼續向巴雷特瓦堤壩中。現判明日印軍由三月二十一日迄四月十日，在南部印緬邊境方面所擭戰果如次：敵軍棄屍一二〇〇具，遺棄軍馬一百匹，　獲或破壞敵戰車十輛，輕裝甲車二七輛，卡車百十一輛，迫擊砲四，欃關砲一，重輕機關槍三十七，自動步槍三十四，步槍三二二，降落傘二百，舟艇十一，幕舍一，其他糧秣被服彈藥極夥。</p>
<p>仰光十八日中央社電　印度國民軍各部隊與日軍共同進擊，致使敵軍已陷於無力應戰之狀態，因此乃對印度國民軍之活動極力採取防衛措置，即防衛伊姆法爾周圍之敵軍，乃不得已變更英軍所堅持之印兵第一綫主義之傳統方針，而行古爾加第一綫，英人第二錢，印兵第三綫之新配置。然英印軍內部之印兵已呈動搖，全軍士氣沮喪，命令系統已形混亂，相繼參加國民軍者與日俱增。十四日上午於摩巴竇高地之敵軍Ｋ中尉以下三十二名印兵，因不堪英人壓迫，向日軍前綫部隊請求參加國民軍陣營，自此即可窺知敵陣營之混亂情形。</p>
<h3>反英運動熾烈　印局勢混亂　會議派開積極活動</h3>
<p>盤谷十八日中央社電　日印同盟軍自以破竹之勢攻入馬尼布爾後，印度之政治已受極大之影響，最近更因以會義派爲中心之中央機會，回敎聯盟等之反英運動日趨積極化，故現時印度已呈從未曾有之大混亂。會議派之活動於東部及西北部之地下組織，現已日趨活躍，阿薩密，孟加拉各鐵路車站已到處貼有「歡迎獨立軍一·「驅逐英人」。「鮑壓，但此等會議派之勢力，早己漫這各鐵道職員之全體。此外，會議派於聯合國更高唱不納租稅運動及組織罷工，怠工等遝動，英印當局今雖已限制印人之移動及出動秘密警察，對民衆實行彈壓，並於孟加拉省政府成立保安委員會，對此强行壓制，但阿薩密東部孟加拉省之印人官吏，認為實踐獨立之良欃已至，已皆紛紛放棄職守，參加地下活動。又素稱爲印度獨立運動回敎徒聯盟巴勒斯坦之一部，最近亦首先要求阿薩密，孟加拉之獨立，致使現下稱爲與會議派立於同一立塲之赤社黨，於最近數週以來，已展開積極活動，瓦基立斯坦（西北國境省南部地方）暴動之民衆，近更到處襲擊警署，當局雖已派遣大批軍隊，警察實行彈壓，但結果反爲火上加油，暴動之事件日趨熾烈。又據八日德里電台廣播：南印馬都拉各工塲，因工人罷工關係，現已不得不停止工作，可見罷工風潮範圍已相當廣大，反映此種情勢，代表西部資本家利益之孟買工塲要求改組，行政參事會於十日孟買市會並選舉現於獄中之會議派那金得拉氏爲市長，由此亦可見印度民衆對英印當局展開猛別政治鬥爭之一斑矣。</p>

<h3>德對戰局變化　有萬全準備　荷蘭沿海岸防務堅強</h3>
<p>柏林十八日中央社電　德國通信社記者十七日曾報稱，德軍當局於戰情紛繁中所坂之臨機應變體制如次：本週伊始，東綫曾發生多種變化，惟全今後數日間似無激戰，反軸心軍侵入歐洲之準備，刻仍孜孜進展，其攻擊計劃似將逐次就緒，德軍當局亦有萬全之對策。據德軍當局稱：東部戰綫之德軍，在接到展開大規模攻擊命令之前，均沉着準備作戰，東綫變化之結果，已在德軍最高司令部之計劃中。德軍所取之「遲延戰術」，乃德軍最高司令部常局於愼重檢討後而實施者，對於蘇軍暫時之成功，自不能予過小評價，然而到達一定地點，德軍將取斷然之手段予以重創。對於克里米亞半島西南部下角地帶之軍事情形，應依全盤之軍事形勢觀察</p>
<p>柏林十八日中央社電　據海通社訊，軍事記者克勞斯於視察西歐防務後發表感想稱。敵軍如欲在西爾特·馬斯·萊茵等河口攻歐，必須先佔得阿之重要城鎭亦均加以佈防。此外更劃出水淹陣地，以保衛要塞，即使敵以飛機遝兵降於內地，亦不能有活動之自由。如敵兵侵人萊茵。馬斯。或西爾特河口，則該處陸地可立即爲水淹沒，無從建立橋頭堡壘。德軍爲測騐水淹區域，是否有利於敵方起見，曾以各種不同之方法，不時　行演習。</p>
<h3>法再成戰塲　期不在遠　賴代爾警告民家</h3>
<p>巴黎十八日中央社電　據海通社訊：法國「晨報」今晨刋載賴伐爾向里昻區內高級官員發表之演說。賴伐爾提及反軸心軍在西歐登陸之可能，據稱，法國再成戰塲之期或者不遠，希望人民瞭解政府之意旨，萬一反軸心軍與德軍在法國境內開火，政府將採取設施，協助槍林彈雨區丙之人民脫離危境，究竟日後反軸心軍登陸時保護法國人之生命者，維希政府歟，阿爾及爾政府歟，諸君拭目以觀其後可也。</p>
<h3>德軍進駐洪牙利後　巴爾幹軍政局面改觀</h3>
<p>蘇聯軍隊節節向羅馬尼亞與洪牙利邊境方面推進以來，巴爾幹半島東北部邊境的形勢，愈加緊迫，達於極點。東南歐戰綫的推移，現爲全歐洲所密切注視。蘇軍的推進，究將持續至何時何處爲止？德軍對付的戰略又如何？以下就各種情勢作一綜合的檢討。</p>
<p>一千公里鐵血戰綫槪觀現在的戰綫，德軍南方戰區的最右翼爲自尼柯拉埃夫西面起至貝爾羅亞馬斯克至，長二百五十公里。中央戰區自貝爾維亞馬斯克地區起，折而向西，自巴爾達方面，越聶斯特河，更通至羅馬尼亞國貝薩拉尼亞省的巴爾基，其後再沿布爾特河，經契埃爾諾雜茲，柯洛米亞，史丹尼斯洛夫地區，而至達諾波里地區，蜿蜒五百公里。左翼則自達諾波里起，至柯維埃利止，長三百公里。</p>
<p>蘇軍自尼柯拉埃夫至巴爾達方面，爲莫里諾夫斯基的第三島克闌軍，中央部份爲柯奈夫的第二烏克蘭軍，北布古羅諾方面以北，爲契柯夫第一島克蘭軍，各自向前進擊。</p>
<p>但此三戰綫中，以中央戰區的聶斯特與布格河的中間地帶，最爲重要，該區戰事富於機動性，蘇軍業已攻陷巴爾基而達波爾特河，一部份已渡河向羅馬尼亞平原進擊，與德軍展開大戰。</p>
<p>同時德軍已聲明放棄北布兄維諾的要衝契埃爾諾維茲，喀爾巴阡山麓的要衝柯洛米亞史丹尼斯拉奧斯地區亦在激戰中。克洛米亞乃貫通偷倍克，達諾波里，契埃爾諾利茲，布達倍斯特四幹綫的交叉點，在軍事上，意裏我自屬重大。</p>
<p>蘇聯進攻目標蘇軍大規模進攻的目標，在軍事方面有三：　攻略羅馬尼亞油田地帶　包圍島克蘭戰綫德軍。藉此搖撼東部全綫的德軍防禦力量，而奪取德軍的抗戰力量。</p>
<p>不過穌軍實力無論如何强大，到底不能席卷巴爾幹全境，故蘇軍的軍事攻勢，毋寗說是對於收獲政治的效果，期望較大，即乘　軍接近巴爾幹諸國時，進行赤化的政治工作。蘇聯自去年起，繼續對全歐進行政治攻勢，不容英美置隊，此爲周知的事實。最近對於巴爾幹，接觸更其積極化，捷克逃亡政客貝奈斯的利用，對舊南斯拉夫基特巴爾蒂孫政權的直接軍事援助，中立關係方面，利用保加利亞，强化駐保國的蘇聯公使館武官室人員，加强文化宣傳工作的活動，以及前「第三國際」議長米特洛夫之到達保國京城蘇斐亞等，都可證明其策動。</p>
<p>最近蘇聯報紙論及巴爾幹政策，主張塞爾維亞，兄羅地亞，保加利亞，羅馬尼亞，瑪蓋特尼亞，希臘等打成一片，組成巴爾幹聯邦，成立親蘇人民政府。蘇聯的企圖若何，已昭然若揭。</p>
<p>德軍閃電對策德軍為應付重大局面，以疾雷之勢，進駐洪牙利以來，飛躍的強化，巴爾幹全境的軍政局面，有劃時期的改觀。德軍新銳部隊的喀爾巴阡佈防，保加利亞與羅馬尼亞的進一層積極對得協力，巴爾幹橫斷鐵道及道路河流連絡的確保圓滑化等，從德國本土延展幾條强烈的「綫」，成為扣扣住巴爾幹的鐵筋。</p>
<p>德軍爲確保巴爾幹而斷然作軍事上的措置，同時對於巴爾幹全境所與政治上的影響極爲重大的事實，也不忽視。在這種意義上，故在洪牙利分駐若干德軍，以備英美開闢第二戰綫時，而節約預備兵力，自能收十分效果。</p>
<p>至於羅馬尼亞，尤其是貝薩拉比亞方面，遭受直接威脅，已與德國進一步協力，內政方面，在安多奈斯哥將軍統治下，團結堅固，而德軍進駐洪牙利以來，對却特的巴爾基遜，斷然加以掃蕩，故克羅地亞邦的地位，又更見强化。</p>
<p>現在蘇聯在巴爾幹政治活動唯一的立足點爲保加利亞。該國的親蘇派和非法的共產黨、最近活動頗劇，但現任攝政及政府堅決支持軸心的政策策，親蘇分子的策動不足以成爲政治上的大患。保加利亞與土耳其關係良好，反軸心方面無論如何煽動，兩國決不致參戰。英美最近對保京實施恐怖空襲後，使該國人民異常憤慨，而詛咒英美　。</p>
<p>所以德國今後的第二戰綫對策，當在該方面加緊增强兵力，至少憑藉現在的一錢，反攻蘇軍，使其崩潰，並非不可能，故以前的消極作戰，至此將吿一段落。一方面，着着推進巴爾幹內部的强化工作。成爲歐洲軸心的重要兵站部的巴爾幹在現在的軍事與政治狀况下，萬不容蘇聯進行搗亂。（譯自四月三日讀賣報知）</p>
<h3>各國使領人員　英禁止離境　美政府亦採同樣樣措置</h3>
<p>日內瓦十八日中央社電　據倫敦來訊：英外部本日發表公吿：自今日夜半起，各國外交官及迎務員均禁離英境，而各國使節之公文袋亦須受檢查，其不受此項限制者爲美國·蘇聯。及各自治領（愛爾蘭除外）。此項公吿全文如次：「本政府曾通知各國駐英外交使節，自四月十七至十八日夜半起至再行通吿時止，實施下列禁條：　外交使節不得在英境收發密碼電報。　非經檢查不得遞送外交文件袋，又在上述時日後，亦非經檢查不得收受公件袋。　公務連絡員外交及領事人員及其公務及私用人員，均不得離境。該公吿繼稱，本政府鑒於今年內即將發動空前軍事行動，凡情報洩濔足以資敵，或使本國及其友邦人士之生命遭遇不必要之損失　不僅對此種軍事行動幷對本國及任何有關國家問之關係，均足招致嚴重後　。茲迫不獲已，採取此項非常安全措施，此項限制在與安全措施相應之條件下，自當於可能時期內　速予以撤銷，同時在可能範圍內，於各國外交及領事人員與本國政府間之通訊儘量予以便利。</p>
<p>里斯本十八日中央社電　美政府已與英政府一致行動，對外國外交人員施行同樣之限制，自昨日夜半起，此輩外交人員不准傳遞或收受未經檢查之任何外交文件袋·亦不得派遣　員或使　人員　其家屬　去美國。據示此項對於外交人員之限　，其嚴厲爲空　未有。</p>

<h3>中日當前急務　加緊經濟關係　松平部發表談話</h3>
<p>因新任國府最高經濟顧問小倉正恒氏之抵任，各方面咸深切期待決戰下中日經濟關係更將推進，上海日大使館事務所松平情報部長，昨日下午五時在匯中飯店會見外人記者時，曾發衣談話，力言密切加緊中日經濟關係，爲當前急務。</p>
<p>極大期待松平部長稱：小倉國府經濟顧問，業於十七日自滬晉京，較預定日程遲一天，該氏即日發表就任抱負，其中有言云：「中日兩國欲言經濟提攜，必先謀使爾國經濟界人士理念之融合，換言之，不僅中國經濟界人士宜對日本之國情及軍事力，經濟力，以及科學技術等有深切之認識，同時日本方面，尤須深切理解，中國文化經濟之實况以及國民之傳統習慣，此則余所認爲最要者也」。小倉顧問曾於去夏以經濟視察團團長之資格，率同經濟界代表來華，在上海與中國經濟界人士懇談，又於南京與國府耍員開誠布公，交換意見，故該氏對於中國經濟狀况，早已瞭如指掌，我日本方面固勿諭，即中國方面亦以極大期待，寄於小倉顧問。</p>
<p>携手同進去歲來華之際，余在南京得有機會，向經濟視察團團長該氏及團員一行叩詢寫見。今日余腦際猶能憶及，一行等曾申述如次見解，略謂：過去日本之實業家；並未在中國十分活動，何以言之，蓋在中國之經濟活動，除紡織業等以外，主要老以貿易及其附屬之金融船舶業爲中心，但因中國國內政情不安，如事變前之排日風潮，使日本實業家各有恐慌心理，對投資咸裹足不前，且將業已投資者，亦紛紛收回，然今日情形轉變，中國第一流實業家均願與日本實業家携手同進，故日本實業家亦希望與中國有力實業家提携。</p>
<p>共同戰綫在事變前，誠如上述情形，中日兩國間處處對時抗爭，即經濟上亦有背道而馳之處，然現在中日雙方已臨到不得不合作一致的命運，所謂「中國爲農業國，日本爲工業國」之成見，亦吿　除，雙方處於長短相補，有無相通之關係，成爲共同戰綫之戰友，保持同生共死之關係。</p>
<p>援華決心日本於去歲以來，實施各項新政策，以經濟關係而言，例如廢止軍票，緩和物資移動限制，調整合辦公司等，如有經濟上困難時，互相協助，前此日本政府表明始終援助中國通貨之決意，此亦基於上述關係之措置，由此更可明示兩國經濟方針，是始終不渝的，今次吾人在此種確乎不動之方針下，歡迎新顧問，日前曾聞中國方面經濟界意見，渴望首先使上海經濟趨於正常，尤其是振興各種工業，但吾人亦抱着同樣的希望。</p>

        <h1>1944 - n106</h1>
<h3>Establishing a Civil Service System</h3>
<p>We advocate for clearing up official corruption, propose examinations and personnel assessments, and further advocate for establishing a civil service system. To many, these may seem like overly critical views and impractical theories. However, these are things that should have been done long ago. Because they weren't done in peacetime, they have greatly impacted wartime efforts. If we are still complacent and not moving forward to implement these measures during wartime, then victory in the war is unattainable. This is the fundamental reason why we repeatedly, without fear of verbose language or taboo, offer candid and direct advice.</p>
<p>The civil service system is the merit system, the best crystallization of modern politics. Civil servants are the most fundamental part of the entire political system. All daily administrative affairs are executed by civil servants. After political leaders decide on major policies, they need not consult further and can entrust all execution to civil servants. Therefore, civil servants are the ones directly implementing government affairs, and they may be even more important to the people than political officials. The establishment of a civil service system aims to select outstanding talent to execute affairs, ensure their livelihood security, and solidify their positions. The key points are threefold: Civil service appointments must be based on examinations. Civil servants' livelihoods must be secure. Civil servants' tenure should not be affected by political tides. Requiring civil servants to pass examinations prevents anyone from using personal connections or placing their own party members in positions. Open competitive examinations can further select virtuous and talented individuals, giving those with ability and learning opportunities for self-advancement. Civil servants must pass strict examinations, and those who pass are undoubtedly outstanding individuals. Looking at China, the quality of public officials would at least improve.</p>
<p>To ensure civil servants are incorruptible, we must first secure their livelihoods. The saying "Only when clothing and food are sufficient will people know propriety and righteousness" is a universal truth. Civil servants are the ones who directly interact with the people. If they become corrupt due to financial insecurity, it is the ordinary people who suffer directly. However, the responsibility for "appointing the wrong people" should be borne by the government and cannot be shirked. We have already spoken extensively about the issue of securing public officials' livelihoods. Recently, regarding the livelihood of Shanghai's police officers, we further suggested that the government cannot immediately handle the problem so the people should do everything possible to assist first. For example, with the establishment of cooperatives, the people should do their best to provide loans to promote their success, and the government should first raise funds to repay the people. The police themselves should be very honest and serve the people. This is the model of "government-people cooperation."</p>
<p>Civil service is a lifelong career, so it should not be affected by political tides. Establishing a civil service system can break the "a new emperor, a new court" mentality, allowing outstanding talent to avoid scheming and currying favor, and instead use their own abilities, their own morality, and their own service performance as a lifelong guarantee. This point is even more important at a time when the tenure of current political officials is uncertain. It is natural for political officials to change with their own moral character, abilities, and the sentiments of the people. If civil servants also have uncertain tenure, the entire political system will inevitably be in chaos, and the people will suffer even more. Therefore, ensuring that civil servants are not swayed by political tides protects the lifelong service of outstanding civil servants.</p>
<p>For decades, most people in our China have focused on political affairs and rarely paid attention to administrative affairs. Some even consider administrative affairs to be the work of clerks and petty officials and disdain them. As for how to cultivate administrative talent and how to provide security, of course, there is no discussion. We must recognize that if a civil service system is not established, peacetime politics cannot get on the right track. Then, when dealing with wartime, compared to other countries, we will naturally "pale in comparison." We hope the government will pay close attention to this.</p>
<h3>Intense Attacks by Japanese and Indian Troops; Enemy Retreats North from Maungdaw; Increasing Numbers of Indian Soldiers on the Front Lines Defect to the National Army</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Rangoon, 18th – The fighting around the pass southwest of Maungdaw has intensified since midnight on the 14th until dawn on the 15th. The enemy forces, under intense attacks from various Japanese and Indian units, have abandoned their positions in the hilly areas southwest of Taung Bazar and have retreated from the first line of defense. They are now holding the second line of defense with armored vehicles as the main support, continuing to resist. On the other hand, at dawn on the 14th, the enemy forces launched a fierce and indiscriminate artillery bombardment against the Japanese army with heavy artillery and field guns, firing as many as 10,000 shells in one day and night. The Japanese army also responded with artillery fire towards the enemy positions, so the narrow Maungdaw line was filled with the intense sound of artillery fire from both sides. Furthermore, as the enemy forces retreated from the first line, they set fire to nearby villages to prevent the Japanese and Indian troops from pursuing. By midnight on the 15th, the enemy's heavy artillery positions finally succumbed to the Japanese army's intense attacks and began to move backwards. At dawn on the 16th, under the cover of aircraft, the remaining artillery and armored vehicle units fled north of Maungdaw. The Japanese and Indian troops, recognizing that the time had come, launched an attack on the already wavering enemy positions. As a result, Maungdaw, which the enemy had been stubbornly holding for several days, fell into the hands of the Japanese and Indian troops under their fierce attacks.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Burmese Front Base, 18th – After the Japanese and Indian troops launched a general offensive in the Kaladan area, they defeated the British non-military forces and are now continuing towards the Paletwa Dam. It is now judged that the Japanese and Indian troops achieved the following results in the southern India-Burma border area from March 21st to April 10th: 1,200 enemy corpses were abandoned, 100 military horses were abandoned, 10 enemy tanks were captured or destroyed, 27 light armored vehicles, 111 trucks, 4 mortars, 1 cannon, 37 heavy and light machine guns, 34 automatic rifles, 322 rifles, 200 parachutes, 11 boats, 1 barrack, and a large amount of other grain, clothing, and ammunition were captured.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Rangoon, 18th – The Indian National Army units are advancing together with the Japanese army, causing the enemy forces to be in a state of being unable to resist. Therefore, they are taking extremely defensive measures against the activities of the Indian National Army. That is, the enemy forces defending Imphal are forced to change the traditional policy of the British army insisting on the first line being composed of Indian troops and instead implement a new deployment of Gurkha troops in the first line, British troops in the second line, and Indian troops in the third line. However, the Indian troops within the British and Indian armies are showing signs of wavering, the morale of the entire army is low, the command system is in disarray, and the number of those joining the National Army is increasing daily. On the morning of the 14th, Lieutenant K and 32 Indian soldiers from the enemy forces at the Mopaung Heights, unable to bear the pressure from the British, requested to join the National Army camp from the Japanese army front-line units. From this, one can glimpse the chaotic situation within the enemy camp.</p>
<h3>Intense Anti-British Movement; Chaotic Situation in India; Congress Party Initiates Active Campaign</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Bangkok, 18th – Since the Japanese-Indian Allied Forces entered Manipur with a sweeping momentum, Indian politics have been greatly affected. Recently, the anti-British movement, centered on the Congress Party, the Central Committee, and the Muslim League, has become increasingly active. Therefore, India is currently in an unprecedented state of great chaos. The activities of the Congress Party's underground organizations in the eastern and northwestern regions are becoming increasingly active. Railway stations in Assam and Bengal are plastered with slogans such as "Welcome the Independence Army," "Expel the British," and "Down with [unclear]" These forces of the Congress Party have already permeated all railway employees. In addition, the Congress Party is advocating a no-tax movement and organizing strikes and slowdowns to the United Nations. Although the British-Indian authorities have now restricted the movement of Indians and deployed secret police to suppress the people, and have established a security committee in the Bengal Provincial Government to forcibly suppress them, Indian officials in eastern Assam and Bengal Province, believing that the opportune time to achieve independence has arrived, are abandoning their posts and joining underground activities. Furthermore, the Muslim League, which has a reputation for being an Indian independence movement, and a part of Palestine, has recently been the first to demand the independence of Assam and Bengal. As a result, the Red Shirt Party, which is now said to stand on the same position as the Congress Party, has launched an active campaign in recent weeks. The rioting people of Waziristan (southern part of the Northwest Frontier Province) have recently been attacking police stations everywhere. Although the authorities have dispatched a large number of troops and police to suppress them, the result has been to add fuel to the fire, and the incidents of rioting are becoming increasingly intense. Furthermore, according to a broadcast from Delhi Radio on the 8th, all factories in Madurai, southern India, have had to stop work due to worker strikes, which shows that the scope of the strike wave is quite extensive. Reflecting this situation, the Bombay factory, which represents the interests of western capitalists, demanded reorganization. The Bombay Municipal Council elected Mr. Narendra, a Congress Party member currently in prison, as mayor on the 10th, from which one can also see a glimpse of the fierce political struggle launched by the Indian people against the British-Indian authorities.</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Attack the Marshall Islands; Bomb Enemy Base</h3>

<h3>Germany Fully Prepared for Changes in the War Situation; Strong Coastal Defenses in the Netherlands</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 18th – A German News Agency reporter reported on the 17th that the German military authorities' contingency response system in the midst of complex war situations is as follows: At the beginning of this week, various changes occurred on the Eastern Front, but it seems that there will be no fierce battles in the next few days. The Axis powers' preparations for invading Europe are still progressing diligently. Their attack plan seems to be gradually getting ready, and the German military authorities also have comprehensive countermeasures. According to the German military authorities, the German troops on the Eastern Front are calmly preparing for combat before receiving orders to launch a large-scale attack. The results of the changes on the Eastern Front are already in the German High Command's plan. The "delaying tactics" adopted by the German army are implemented after careful review by the German High Command. The temporary success of the Soviet army should not be underestimated, but when they reach a certain point, the German army will take decisive measures to inflict heavy damage. The military situation in the southwestern corner of the Crimean Peninsula should be observed in the context of the overall military situation.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 18th – According to the Maritime News Agency, military reporter Klaus, after inspecting the defenses of Western Europe, expressed his impressions, saying that if the enemy wants to attack Europe at the mouths of the Scheldt, Maas, and Rhine rivers, they must first occupy important towns, which are all fortified. In addition, waterlogged areas have been designated to protect fortresses. Even if the enemy air drops troops into the interior, they will not have freedom of movement. If enemy troops invade the mouths of the Rhine, Maas, or Scheldt rivers, the land there can be immediately flooded, making it impossible to establish bridgeheads. The German army has conducted regular exercises using various methods to test whether the waterlogged areas are beneficial to the enemy.</p>
<h3>France to Become a Battlefield Again; The Date is Not Far Off; Laval Warns the People</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Paris, 18th – According to the Maritime News Agency, the French "Le Matin" published this morning an address by Laval to senior officials in the Lyon region. Laval mentioned the possibility of an Allied landing in Western Europe. It is said that the date for France to become a battlefield again may not be far off. He hopes the people understand the government's intentions. In the event that the Allies and the German army open fire in France, the government will take measures to help the people in the gun-filled and bullet-riddled areas escape danger. Ultimately, when the Allies land, will it be the Vichy government or the Algiers government that protects the lives of the French people? Gentlemen, wait and see what happens.</p>
<h3>After German Troops Entered Hungary, the Military and Political Situation in the Balkans Changed</h3>
<p>Since Soviet troops have been advancing towards the Romanian and Hungarian borders, the situation on the northeastern border of the Balkan Peninsula has become increasingly urgent, reaching its peak. The movement of the Southeastern European front is now being closely watched by all of Europe. How long and where will the Soviet advance continue? What is Germany's counter strategy? The following is a comprehensive review of various situations.</p>
<p>A panoramic view of the 1,000-kilometer Iron and Blood Front The current front line, the southernmost wing of the German Southern War Zone, extends from the west of Nikolaev to Belloya Mask, a length of 250 kilometers. The central war zone starts from the Belloya Mask area, turns west, crosses the Dniester River from the Barda area, and then leads to Balki in Bessarabia Province, Romania. Then, along the Prut River, it passes through Chernivtsi, Kolomyia, and Stanislaviv areas to the Danupoli area, winding for 500 kilometers. The left wing extends from Danupoli to Kovel, a length of 300 kilometers.</p>
<p>From Nikolaev to the Barda area, the Soviet forces are Molinovsky's 3rd Ukrainian Front; the central part is Konev's 2nd Ukrainian Front; and north of the North Bukovina area is Chekhov's 1st Ukrainian Front, each attacking forward.</p>
<p>However, among these three front lines, the middle zone of the Dniester and Bug rivers in the central war zone is the most important. The battle in this area is highly mobile. The Soviet army has already captured Balki and reached the Prut River, and part of it has crossed the river to attack the Romanian plains, launching a major battle with the German army.</p>
<p>At the same time, the German army has declared its abandonment of Chernivtsi, a key point in North Bukovina, and the key areas of Kolomyia and Stanislaviv at the foot of the Carpathian Mountains are also in fierce fighting. Kolomyia is the intersection of the four trunk lines connecting Stupek, Danupoli, Chernivtsi, and Budapest, and is militarily very important.</p>
<p>Soviet Attack Objectives The objectives of the Soviet army's large-scale offensive are threefold in the military aspect: Conquer the Romanian oil field area Surround the German army on the Ukrainian front. Use this to shake the defensive strength of the German army on the entire Eastern Front and seize the German army's resistance strength.</p>
<p>However, no matter how strong the Soviet army's strength is, it cannot sweep the entire Balkans. Therefore, the Soviet army's military offensive is more likely to achieve political effects, with greater expectations, that is, to carry out red political work when the Soviet army approaches the Balkan countries. It is a well-known fact that the Soviet Union has continued to launch political offensives throughout Europe since last year, not allowing the United States and Britain to stand in the way. Recently, contact with the Balkans has become more active. The use of Czech fugitive politician Benes, direct military assistance to the Kitte Barticoun regime in the former Yugoslavia, the use of Bulgaria in neutral relations, the strengthening of the Soviet embassy military attaché in Bulgaria, the strengthening of cultural propaganda activities, and the arrival of the former "Third International" chairman Dmitrov in Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, all prove its strategy.</p>
<p>Recently, Soviet newspapers discussed Balkan policy, advocating that Serbia, Croatia, Bulgaria, Romania, Macedonia, Greece, etc., should be united to form a Balkan Federation and establish a pro-Soviet People's Government. The Soviet Union's attempt is already clear.</p>
<p>German Blitz Countermeasures Since the German army entered Hungary with lightning speed to deal with the major situation, the military and political situation in the entire Balkan region has undergone epoch-making changes due to the rapid strengthening. The deployment of new German troops in the Carpathians, Bulgaria and Romania's further active cooperation with Germany, and the smooth and secure connection of Balkan cross-border railways, roads, and rivers, etc., extend several strong "lines" from the German mainland, becoming iron bars holding the Balkans.</p>
<p>The German army took decisive military measures to ensure the Balkans, and at the same time, it did not neglect the extremely important fact of the political impact on the entire Balkan region. In this sense, stationing some German troops in Hungary in order to save reserve forces when Britain and the United States open up a second front can achieve full effect.</p>
<p>As for Romania, especially Bessarabia, which is under direct threat, it has further cooperated with Germany. In terms of internal affairs, under the rule of General Antonescu, it is firmly united. Since the German army entered Hungary, the Balkisson of Chette has been resolutely swept away, so the status of the State of Croatia has been further strengthened.</p>
<p>At present, the only foothold for Soviet political activities in the Balkans is Bulgaria. The pro-Soviet faction and the illegal Communist Party in the country have been very active recently, but the current regents and government firmly support the Axis policy, and the pro-Soviet elements' activities are not enough to become a major political problem. Bulgaria has good relations with Turkey. No matter how the anti-Axis side instigates, the two countries will never participate in the war. After Britain and the United States recently carried out terrorist air raids on the capital of Bulgaria, it aroused the people of the country to be extremely indignant and curse Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>Therefore, Germany's future countermeasures for the second front will be to step up the reinforcement of troops in that area. At least, relying on the current front line, it is not impossible to counterattack the Soviet army and cause it to collapse. Therefore, the previous passive combat will come to an end at this point. On the one hand, it is steadily advancing the strengthening work inside the Balkans. The Balkans, which have become an important supply depot for the European Axis, cannot allow the Soviet Union to disrupt the current military and political situation.

<h3>Personnel of Various Countries’ Embassies and Consulates - Britain Forbids Departure - The US Government Also Adopts Similar Measures</h3>
<p>Geneva, 18th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a dispatch from London: The British Foreign Office issued a public notice today stating that, effective from midnight tonight, diplomats and consular officials of all countries are forbidden from leaving British territory, and the diplomatic pouches of the heads of missions of all countries must also be subject to inspection. The United States, the Soviet Union, and the self-governing dominions (excluding Ireland) are not subject to this restriction. The full text of the notice is as follows: "This Government has notified the diplomatic representatives of all countries stationed in Britain that, from midnight on April 17th to 18th until further notice, the following prohibitions will be implemented: Diplomatic representatives may not send or receive coded telegrams in British territory. Diplomatic pouches may not be delivered without inspection, nor may official pouches be received after the aforementioned date without inspection. Official liaison officers, diplomatic and consular personnel, and their official and private staff may not leave the country." The notice continued, stating that "In view of the unprecedented military operations to be launched this year, any leakage of information sufficient to aid the enemy, or to subject the lives of our country and its allies to unnecessary loss, would not only seriously prejudice these military operations but also seriously damage the relations between our country and any relevant countries. We are therefore compelled to take these extraordinary security measures. These restrictions, subject to conditions commensurate with security measures, will be lifted as soon as possible and, to the extent possible, communication between diplomatic and consular personnel of various countries and our government will be facilitated as much as possible."</p>
<p>Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The US government has acted in concert with the British government, imposing similar restrictions on foreign diplomats. Since midnight yesterday, these diplomats are not allowed to transmit or receive any diplomatic pouches without inspection, nor are they allowed to dispatch staff or send family members to the United States. It is reported that the severity of this restriction on diplomatic personnel is unprecedented.</p>

<h3>Residence Permits Can Be Renewed Without Photos - Explanation of Renewal Method by the Head of the Baojia Office</h3>
<p>The Baojia Office of the First Police Bureau has already formulated and announced the measures for renewing residence permits. However, some Baojia sections of some sub-bureaus often demand photos or require personal seals when residents apply for renewal, creating difficulties. Yesterday, a reporter from the Central News Agency made a special visit to the head of the Baojia Office, Mr. 　　Wu, 　　who explained as follows: "Our Bureau has made every effort to save materials in the renewal method, so the issue of photos has been carefully considered. It has been decided that those who have already obtained a citizen permit from the sub-bureau are allowed to be exempted from submitting photos, except for those whose photos are damaged or unclear. They can use the photos left with the sub-bureau when applying for the citizen permit. Although the processing procedures are somewhat troublesome, public officials must serve the people as a principle and think of the people. This point has already been announced, so we regret the difficulties caused by the Baojia sections of the sub-bureaus and will order them to follow the rules."</p>
<p>Seal Not Required</p>
<p>"Also, although the application form has the words 'seal' under the applicant's name, the filling instructions state that 'the application must be signed and sealed by the head of the household and the head of the Jia to be valid.' Therefore, those who do not have a personal seal do not need to affix a seal, and fingerprints have already been affixed. All the heads of the Jia and households have seals, but not all residents have them, so those who have seals should affix them, and those who do not have seals can be exempted. This is also a point of saving materials and simplifying procedures. Our office will order the Baojia sections of the sub-bureaus to follow the rules to facilitate the people."</p>
<h3>Preparatory Meeting for the Chamber of Commerce Association Representative Assembly to be Held Today</h3>

<h3>Commemorative Tickets for Airplane Contributions - Solicited by Baojia Heads</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal People's Committee for Aircraft Contributions has printed the Baojia commemorative tickets for airplane contributions, and the purchase campaign will be launched soon. The detailed measures are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>In order to give people at all levels the opportunity to donate money for aircraft, "Baojia Commemorative Tickets for Airplane Contributions" are specially printed, divided into two types: five yuan and ten yuan.</p>
<h3>67th Period Household Rice - Rice Shops Can Pick Up Rice Today - The City's Food Supply is Still Abundant</h3>
<p>The allocation of household rice has been slightly delayed due to the transfer of the Director of the Food Bureau and the handover. According to reporters, Shanghai's food supply is still abundant. The 67th period household rice, each rice shop has paid the money to the Material Procurement and Allocation Section yesterday to exchange for the warehouse receipt, and can pick up rice from Zhejiang Xingye, Taikoo, China and other warehouses today. It can be sold in the near future, so the unreasonable rise in the black market price of rice can be brought under control.</p>
<p>The Baojia commemorative tickets for airplane contributions are distributed by the committee to the district offices, which are then distributed to each household by the Baojia heads, who are responsible for publicizing and encouraging each household to purchase them voluntarily in order to prevent abuses.</p>
<p>After receiving the commemorative tickets, each Baojia head must consider the economic situation of each household and encourage them to purchase ten-yuan or five-yuan tickets. If any household has any questions, the Baojia head should explain and guide them at any time.</p>
<p>The amount of tickets purchased by each household should be voluntarily sent by each household to the district office to which they belong for collection. The district office should stamp the ticket after receiving the money from each household and quickly transfer it to the bank designated by the committee.</p>
<p>Baojia heads must not force households that cannot afford to purchase tickets, but the tickets issued must be returned to the distributing agency.</p>
<p>These measures will be implemented after being approved by the municipal government.</p>
<h3>Impersonating Investigators to Extort Business Firms - The Economic Department of the First District Strictly Prohibits</h3>
<p>The price of goods in the city has fluctuated at the end of the year and the beginning of the year, which is a serious harm to the people's livelihood. After the economic and administrative authorities of the city sent personnel to investigate and strictly enforce, the price of goods has gradually stabilized. However, recently, unscrupulous people have taken the opportunity to impersonate investigators to defraud and extort money. The reporter made a special visit to the Economic Department of the First District Office to inquire, and Director Feng received and expressed the following opinions:</p>
<p>"Recently, there have been people who have falsely borrowed the name of investigators to defraud and extort money from various business firms, which is very hateful. I have repeatedly received reports from various reports, and after detailed investigation, the defrauded business firms cannot clearly identify which agency's investigators they are, which I deeply regret. Although there is more than one agency in the city that manages materials and prices, the investigators sent by our office have been strictly regulated in the investigation procedures. Each investigator carries an investigation form and a dispatch form. The dispatch form specifies the names of the business firms to be investigated and the time of the investigation. After the investigation is completed, the dispatch form should be handed over to the person in charge of the investigated business firm for seal verification and brought back to the reporting office, and the head of the competent section will collect the investigation certificates and attendance forms of each investigator on the same day to prevent abuses. This procedure can be said to be tightly knit. Now, there are often cases of investigators extorting money outside, which should be unscrupulous people borrowing names. We hope that when there are investigators going to investigate in the future, each business firm must ask to see the investigator's investigation certificate and dispatch form. If the incoming person claims to be an investigator from our office verbally without showing various certificates, they can call 17200 to inquire with our office and severely punish them. Also, the Economic Security Department has announced its establishment, but before the department has officially started working, our office's investigation work will still continue according to the original policy."</p>

This specially sends a letter to the Nanshi Police Bureau to earnestly investigate and prohibit them.</p>

<h3>Chambers of Commerce Should Transfer Materials - Strive for Fairness - Strictly Prohibit Resale for Profit, Otherwise They Will Be Prosecuted</h3>
<p>Recently, in order to simplify the procedures, various unified allocation authorities have authorized the chambers of commerce of each industry to transfer the materials allocated to them to their member companies. It is learned that the chambers of commerce must strive for fairness when transferring the materials allocated by the authorities and must not favor one over the other or have ulterior motives. Chamber of commerce members who obtain these materials must limit themselves to using them for their own purposes if they are raw materials and must not resell them for profit. If they are manufactured products, they should be sold at the market price and strictly prohibit hoarding and speculation. Chambers of commerce should send personnel to investigate at any time. Once illegal incidents occur, the persons in charge of the chambers of commerce will be punished. It is reported that a few chambers of commerce have charged illegal handling fees from member companies when transferring materials, which is illegal and increases the burden on member companies. However, if chambers of commerce want to charge this fee, they should apply to the authorities for approval in advance.</p>
<h3>High Standing Supervision Committees in Various Industry Markets</h3>
<p>Recently, various industry markets in the city have found that members in the market often fail to abide by the rules in transactions, or even non-industry people mix into the market to engage in black market transactions. This situation has a great impact on prices. In order to thoroughly clarify the order in the market, the various industry markets have separately established supervision committees. The directors and supervisors of the chamber of commerce are ex officio members and take turns to station themselves in the market to supervise everything. At the same time, in order to restrict people from entering the market, each market specially stipulates that members must wear badges, otherwise they will be driven out of the market.</p>

<h3>The Current Urgent Task for China and Japan is to Strengthen Economic Relations - Matsudaira Department Issues Statement</h3>
<p>Due to the appointment of Mr. Ogura Masatsune, the new Supreme Economic Advisor to the National Government, all parties deeply expect that the economic relationship between China and Japan under the decisive battle will be further promoted. Matsudaira, the Minister of Information of the Shanghai Japanese Embassy Office, met with foreign reporters at the Huizhong Hotel at 5 pm yesterday. In his speech, he strongly stated that it is an urgent task to closely strengthen the economic relationship between China and Japan.</p>
<p>Great Expectations Minister Matsudaira said: Mr. Ogura, the Economic Advisor to the National Government, arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai on the 17th, one day later than the scheduled date. He issued a statement on the day of his appointment, saying: "If China and Japan want to talk about economic cooperation, they must first seek to integrate the ideas of economic people in your country. In other words, not only should economic people in China have a deep understanding of Japan's national conditions, military power, economic power, and science and technology, but also Japan should deeply understand the actual situation of Chinese culture and economy, as well as the traditional habits of the people. This is what I think is most important." Last summer, Mr. Ogura came to China as the head of the Economic Observation Group and led representatives of the economic community to have cordial talks with economic people in China in Shanghai, and exchanged views frankly with officials of the National Government in Nanjing. Therefore, he has already understood the economic situation in China. Not only is Japan needless to say, but also China has great expectations for Mr. Ogura.</p>
<p>Join Hands In the past year when I came to China, I had the opportunity to ask Mr. Ogura, the head of the Economic Observation Group, and his members for their opinions in Nanjing. Today, I can still remember in my mind that a group of people stated the following views, which roughly stated: In the past, Japanese industrialists did not have enough activities in China. Why? Because economic activities in China, except for the textile industry, mainly revolved around trade and its affiliated financial shipping industry. However, due to the unstable political situation in China, such as the anti-Japanese wave before the incident, Japanese industrialists had panic and were hesitant to invest, and even withdrew their investments. However, the situation has changed today. The first-class industrialists in China are willing to join hands with Japanese industrialists, so Japanese industrialists also hope to cooperate with powerful industrialists in China.</p>
<p>Common Front Before the incident, as mentioned above, China and Japan were in constant conflict everywhere, and even economically they were going in opposite directions. However, now China and Japan have reached the fate of having to cooperate and be consistent. The stereotype that "China is an agricultural country and Japan is an industrial country" has also been eliminated. Both sides are in a relationship of complementing each other's strengths and communicating with each other's needs, and become comrades in arms on the common front, maintaining a relationship of living and dying together.</p>
<p>Determination to Aid China Since last year, Japan has implemented various new policies. In terms of economic relations, such as the abolition of military tickets, the relaxation of restrictions on the movement of materials, and the adjustment of joint-venture companies, mutual assistance will be provided in case of economic difficulties. Previously, the Japanese government stated its determination to aid Chinese currency from beginning to end, which was also a measure based on the above relationship. This can further clarify that the economic policies of the two countries are consistent. This time, we welcome the new advisor under this firm and immovable policy. A few days ago, we heard the opinions of the economic community in China, who longed to first normalize the economy of Shanghai, especially to revitalize various industries, but we also have the same hope.</p>
