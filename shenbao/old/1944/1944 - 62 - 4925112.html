<h3>日軍迫印度邊境緬戰局入心階段　印國民軍步步向祖國挺進</h3>
<p>東京五日中央社電緬甸前綫某基地五日電：南部緬印邊境日軍，業將英第七師殱減，目前已逼近印度國境，故緬甸戰局已步人一新階段。蒙特巴頓自就仟東南亚反軸心軍司令以來，即運續召開軍事會議，並赴重慶與蔣介石何應欽陳誠等協議反攻緬旬之作戰計劃，是故開春後，緬甸戰局何更形繁迫。然於日軍之巧妙戰衛下，從怒江一戰，即將北方之渝軍擊破，蒙特巴頓經怒江之敗戰後，遂採取漸進主義，期　先廣得全緬之制空櫂，即奪回緬甸，然後再進政南方日軍占領區。然經日軍開始先制作　後，被等即於威烈之砲火下　滅，且為解放祖國而奮起之印國民軍，刻與投降日軍之印兵聯合一起，步步向祖國進攻中，英國之東亞唯一寶庫印度現巳瀕於政治之危機，英東南亞聯軍司令蒙特巴頓見情勢不佳，即倉皇增調兵力，與阻止日軍之進擊吉大港方面，及價舉全力以防衛印度聯境某面，此事足證頓印邊境　局，現已進入深刻之階段，日軍一旦向印度國內進攻，印度果成何狀態，即此次日軍對阿拉坎採取攻勢作戰後，戰局情勢巳經一愛，敵宣傳反攻續甸之舉，現已完全成空想，而反惴　於防止印度之危機。</p>
<p>昭南五日中央社電　自印度國民軍進擊阿拉坎以來，居住南方各地之印度人士均　激昂，茲印獨立聯朋　關報阿儼為辛筆報四日著論，題為「印印度國民軍，均為反抗英美帝國主義求祖國之解放及獨立之張大勢力·自由印度臨時政府係中日德等九國所承認者，此不僅等　印度之存在，而且承認彼此間協力，例如日本支持印度之獨立起見，舉其權利積極予以援助，且為履行此項　言，更進一步對敵人英美進行作戰。緬甸今正竭其權利援助且由印臨時政府國民軍，同時編甸國民刻正與印國民軍携手進羣，最近日緬印三軍為加強其共同作戰，設置速絡　關，此種措置實使印度國民軍獨立存在之威信為之增加。蓋印兵係受英人而作戰·反之印國民軍則係受日人之指揮命令者作戰。同時英軍所指揮之印兵，在薪俸乃至糧食服裝上，均受差別待遇，且英軍指揮下之印兵，係被迫而戰，國民軍係以解放祖國為正義而戰。有血性之印人决不願為奴化祖國而犧牲，吾人確信印度全體國民軍及其間盟軍，齊一步伐，進擊德里，澈底消減英帝國主義</p>
<h3>德海軍專家評論　太平要你管戰局　美軍戰略危險性極大</h3>
<p>柏林五日中央社電　海　社海軍特派員　爾華特著稱：馬里亞納群島施東至戰事，　示美軍方之戰略，乃欲加強海陸軍方面之攻勢，進而在日本外國防綫一帶奪取航空及海軍根據地。此一戰略進行以來已有數月，其危險性極大，蓋美芳自以為較日方有更大至海軍，能負擔重大損失。美方每次使用航空母艦十艘及戰艦八艘，此即知有與日本海軍決戰之意。美芳計　似欲義各根據地，因日木海軍不，及日軍在馬力壓納其他各根據地，因日本海軍不軍並不出現作戰，但所取出現也。但美方此一目的　未實現，日本大部份海軍並不出現作戰，但所取之適應措施，已使美以航空母艦為根據地之空軍無法活動，如美機之轟炸馬里亞納各島及關鳥，僅能出動二百架而已，美艦隊寶力亦日受損折，而日木海軍則始終保全實力，可以靜待時機出擊，此乃日海軍所佔之優勢。</p>
<h3>日極轟炸　遂川及衡陽</h3>
<p>漢口五日中央社電日陸軍機隊，四日夜以目的厚，即安返原防。緣此次轟炸，係於下午十時先　遂川，與敵戰門機交戰後，即猛炸敝饑場，炸毀敵大型及小型機各一架，重創其二架，炸毀其中型機以架及小型機四架至五架，並於是夜十時，　惡劣天氣，空襲衡陽，機場潛走路。日機於收　莫大戰果後即安然返防。</p>
<h3>日岸國務相　防新野書籍長</h3>
<p>東京五日中央社電　日岸國務相五日上午訪問星野書記官長於首相官邸，舉行要談歴時約三十分鐘。</p>
<h3>日大元帥臨幸　大本營海軍部　與島田軍令部長午餐</h3>
<p>東京五日中央社電　日大元　繼下午　為　軍大學舉行　判　　聯　，特於十時　分由蓮沼侍從武官長陪乘松平宮相等供奉下，乘汽車由宮中啟節，行幸品川區海軍大學，親臨甲利學生及　關學生畢業典禮，儀式極為隆重。禮成後，即於上午十一時十五分由該校啟節，順邀親臨大木營海軍部，與島田軍令部德長及各幕僚同進午餐，高松宮殿下亦出席，下午一時五分還宮。</p>
<h3>華北政委會　澈查囤積</h3>
<p>北平五日中央社電　北方各地自薪年以後，物復奭然看漲，甚至有增至若千惜者，按之常理，對此情形　有少數人從中牟和，以致影響民衆生活。平市當局實施檢舉以後價格巳逐漸下落，政委已派專員分赴天津靑島唐一山石門各地，將京市獵　面告當地行政長官，國家施行，各地均確有大量　績情事，已先行予以查對。從，不問其惟純商人活有究以　敵奸頑而平物價。</p>
<h3>北京學生　要求取締無傷</h3>
<p>北平五日中央社電　昨午靑少年團北京市各見慨慨陳詞，非常激烈，能有具體之事實答覆。</p>
<h3>美國野心畢露渝方劑度悲觀</h3>
<p>廣州五日中央社電　美國之對華侵略政策，綫當渝方呻吟苦境之國，即趨露骨化，際始則以廢棄不平等條約條正中國人移民法案播弄　言，或則以武力要　渝方等類施各種衆謀煽稱遲延反攻緬甸，應　咎於英國，而煽動淪方之對英國之下滿心理，暗中漸次衆露美國欲獨佔中國野心。美國究對中國游合居心，就政治軍事經濟各項略舉其活動之一班。如次：</p>
<p>併吞空軍</p>
<p>美國對華君事行動之最　著一　即去年十二月間　成美駐渝聯合空軍以來，美國併吞渝方空軍之陰謀，已為世所　知，一方面容納及養成渝方空軍人員，期擴從美國駐渝空軍之勢力，籍以減輕其空軍幹部之補充困難。又自年之愛過熟心，實為渝方各地少年受美國情報局派出機關之　　所致，彼靠在團內受若于基礎調　後，即被編入緬甸方面美隊伍，供其智慧，從事於無，此種侵犯渝方統師櫃少舉動，使渝方亦抱不滿，由於此舉，故方方之自主　併軍事上之指雖權，亦為美方柑制，渝方已夷為美殖民地軍之地位，當可見矣。此外美軍最近之伸張勢力至渝方西南各省，及緬甸方面與美軍之活動情况，益證實此事之不虛。據重慶電傳，史蒂威爾最近在緬甸方面成立（K）國作戰本部由佛蘭克頓所指揮，該部實即該方面渝軍之作戰指導木部，該方面渝軍集合絢甸作戰之敗殘隊，　在印度由美　將校指遵受美國　之訓練，故新設此項組織，該方面渝軍之統師欄，已為史蒂國爾所掌握，美國不但　張其軍事上實力，　且運用其黃金魔手，誘惑渝方對美借款之五　元中有二　元金　，其旨並非而欲藉此以京　渝方而已</p>
<p>美元充斥</p>
<p>又最近電　　　之　元充斥，使金融市場極旱混亂，可見此為美國國美領化重　市場之最惡策謀也。蓋此項美金本規定除用做義捐金外，不準運往重　，但因中　物價高昂，美駐渝空軍及美僑生水，决定以美金對法幣之換算率公定美元一元値法幣二十元，但照去年之黑市，美金一可換得　幣入士元坂近則以昂至法幣百八十元矣。且此種傾一回美人及其關係業者周極希望，即華人亦為講美元景，狀沉機表悲觀，均攻產，對於此種狀況自不容忽視，但美方則毫不關心，惟恐渝方部迅速　為其經濟上之殖民地者，渝方之完全喪失自主性，甘為美國之附屬，亦屬　　也。</p>
<h3>緬印戰綫日軍　長驅經擊吉大港</h3>
<p>蒙特巴頓的動南亞州聯合軍，自取年十月以來，開始　動，呼號自西部奪還緬甸。其第五。第七兩師瞞，企圖侵入阿拉千方面，被日軍戰略的撤退所誘，一部份侵入孟多地區。但自二攻勢後，者者獲得始大攻勢後，着着獲得戰果，敵方二師　已完全被包國在阿拉千瞰綫的鐵環內，殱減之期，即在不遠，（按之本月四日日大本營發表戰果，印英軍第七師已池州殱減）。同時並表示不長驅直入轟取吉大港之勢，敝方大　恐怖。</p>
<p>被包　在布其頓北方十公　星　阿盆地的敵第七師團，主力約五千，携有戰車百　，卡車五百　，形成直徑一里的重陳，從事抵抗，十三·十四二日，因日軍地上部隊的在襲及空中攻擊，敵陷於完全被　的侖運，而另一方面，使用戰車，携有中口徑砲企圖侵入孟多的第五軍，與第七師團的聯絡亦已被戳斷，通至吉大　的退路亦已中斷，遼在孟多北方熱於本力面分佈中口徑砲，死守陣地。敵的一部巳急從印度南部乘舟艇開始退却。</p>
<p>但日軍航空部隊向之開始轟炸，鄧扣克悲劇將再現於　阿拉干。堪注目者，敵空軍的記錄　急降種炸機中隊在一月內出擎約二百七十次，但最近大為減低，　伺隙向包國際內的敵地上部隊投下食糊。據敵方情報，敵方被迫出動空軍救助部隊所屬盤艇，赴孟加拉灣及阿拉干海岸敎助隨時降落的飛行員。阿拉千悲劇的重演，似無可避免。倫敦每日鄧報稱：</p>
<p>「阿拉千戰爭是世界各地戰爭中最激烈的戰爭。反動心國尚未集中足以在亞洲取大攻勢的兵力。英印軍總司命官歐慶萊克相信日軍終將進入印度，為　制對細甸戰綫英軍的壓迫，今後將訴之一切方策云。」</p>
<p>對日軍作戰極表恐懼。總督華雜爾說：</p>
<p>「余之第一任務，在援助稟南亞洲軍司令，從印度門戶騷逐敵人。不粉碎日本的野心，印度沒有和平，也沒有　榮。」</p>
<p>力竭　地　赶日度協力遂行戰爭。但印度國內的反英運動，正跟着江特拉，鮑斯司令官應下的印度國民軍之進擎阿拉干，而日趨激烈。（翔：歸自二月二十二日西部朝日新聞）</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>不做「美國的同志」</h3>
<p>我們提倡節約快將一年了。起先大家不過在報端發表首論，隨後由新聞聯合會聯絡其他國體，共同發起，組織節約協會，規定節約規程，作進一步的實踐。可是我們所能盡的，不過是勸導的責任，我們希望大家在享受的時候，替國家費源的消耗想想，格沒有享受的同胞想想，因此减少一切無謂的浪費。一年來我們說了許多話，寫了許多文章，但是，提起成績，言之殊覺慚愧。</p>
<p>對於一般中下　的同胞，他們對付日常的生活巳經是勉強得很，當然談不到無謂的浪費。可是一般中上層同胞，他們生活的糜費和奢侈，依然表現在一般人的耳目之中。節約的言論敝不過享樂的心理，道德上的動吿是無用的，一切節省國家資源的空話也毫無用處。浪費的風氣，對社會言，深刻的顯出貧富的不均，無形中使人們生出怨恨的心理，無形中導引人們走上從貪汚而發財的路。對國家言，則是無數的賣源，，無數人的精神與時間，毫無月的地浪費。在戰爭時期，自己多消耗一分力量，便是替敵人多增加一分力量，眞是莫大的报失。社會的制栽力量旣然不能够使人們節約，那來只有政府強迫的力量為可發生效力。</p>
<p>最近二月二十五日日本閣議，決定停止高級享樂具體要剛，內容已見三月一日日本報東京中央社電，而其最值得注意的有二點：一是政府劃的，二是立刻執行的。（全國於三月五日起開始實施）在戰時體制之下，日本政府說到做到的精神，眞是値得欽佩，我們因此希望我們的政府要有決心，同樣的下一個停止高級享樂的命令。</p>
<p>當然，高級享樂塲所的存在，對於戰時國家民族毫無益處的。如果說為了稅收，那未，請把稅收的數宇和物資消耗的數字相比較，究竟那一個合算。如果說為了從美人員的生計，那末，請把從業人員的生計和人們因享樂而發生的墮落和頹廢等等精神上物　上的擴失相比較，究竟那一個重要。享樂塲所和附屬的從業人員是社會上的一種職業，我們自然不應該反對，可是現在是什麼時候，國民是不是應該作洛意志的享樂。戰爭是一個大時代，是一個最大的轉愛　代。應該淘汰的自然應該無所顧惜的　汰，應該改革的自然應該立時立刻的改革。</p>
<p>昨天本報　　日本朝日新聞「檢討必勝生活」一文，其中一段說：生了一點小病，就不到工廠做工。因為收入多而過著遊閑的生活。白天向國民高呼「改革生活，拚命增產」的指導者，到了晚間，却奢　地　肆宴客。」以這種人視為「美國的間志」，還句話是多麼深刻的諷刺·我們期望我國同胞，尤其是中人士，凜乎　美國的同志」這一句話的諷刺，而實踐節約消費。</p>

<h3>舊波瀾邊境　蘇集結重兵　戰事復趨白熱化</h3>
<p>柏林五日中央肚電　海通社訉：東綫各焦點之戰事已趨鬆弛，不久即可知　弛之原因，係泥濘時期之來臨，抑係欲暫停藉以調遣新後備隊。新近比較強烈之攻擊，為在那爾伐之南，蘇軍向南北及西三方推進。向南推進之敵軍僅進二百公尺，其餘二絡則被阻。尼維爾區蘇軍向林那堡城進攻，亦無何成功。中北爾路交接處之饑事　漸　沉　　夫諾之凸出部份，蘇軍已　中火軍，預料不久將加緊進攻。南路克里伏洛格及基洛伏格勒蘇軍，雖集有大隊坦克車，但為泥薄所阻，迄未見活動。</p>

<h3>每日新聞高石社長　返抵東京發表談話　視察　南方過滬印象良好</h3>
<p>東京五日中央社電　此間每日新開社會長高石眞五郎，月前會赴南方考察罵尼拉，美那多，罵加撒，　水，瓜加爾達，　南等前綫各地之建設狀况，並與當地軍官民　談。茲巳畫畢，己於一日下午取道上海乘機返抵東京·據高石談此行印象稱，南方實為得天　厚岸之地城，余等於一月十九日赴南方時，天氣已極溫暖，原住民之住房多為竹製，普通住宅則以磚瓦製成，空內極為凉爽，吾等一行於馬加撤會與西里伯新聞社幹部聚餐火鍋，當時並未感覺炎熱。該地氣侯最　居住，决無　冷驟戰　之變。各地報館無不勵精國治，埋頭苦幹。報紙亦有存貸貯存，最多者可供一年使用，現尚計劃在當地製紙，且已有着手製造者。再余　會見南方佔領區之陸海軍百　，彼等雖為軍目前南方各地均已整備自給自足體制，積極開墾荒地，俾期增產食糧。當地日陸海軍軍人悉充滿必勝信念，並不因些微之障碍而動搖。常地報紙設有日文片假名欄，原住民莫不熱望　習日語，且彼等五無共同語言，故日語頗有普及可能，今能謮日文日語者巳屢見不鮮。又印度那西亞人及華僑之協力亦頗可觀，彼等需要自日木輸入之裙，（爪哇及為來羣烏土人所着之裙）及汗衣等織絲品。此次在上海僅逗留三日，備受該地新聞聯合會歡迎，其中由華日報中報兩社長前會來日本出席大東亞新聞會議，余亦邀請中國新聞界人士舉行座談會，出席者極為踴躍。又彼等灼頗留意日木報章，並各就本位努力，以求復覆典中華保衛東亞之偉業早日完成。</p>

<h3>松島報到部長談　英美利害衝突　戰略上一件絕不一致</h3>
<p>中央社訊　英美聯合軍前會大事宣傳，謂緬甸反攻作戰，為决定反攻東亞作戰，成功與否之重要關鐵，但自展開後，一無進展，彼等之野心，原在企圖奪回亞基耶蒲，但結果及被日木陸軍部隊痛烈打擊，如日大木營四日公佈，敵方喪失兵員七千六百大，此爭不但暴露美國企圖與重慶保持聯絡，以及英國欲保全彼等榨取源泉之印度，雙方意見發生龜裂，且可明顯表示，因一阿拉坎悲劇，」蒙特巴頓東南反軸心軍司令官，與斯蒂維爾之在渝美軍司令官間，戰略上意見之不一致。英美復在東亞之統一戰綫將引起崩潰危機，是以東南亞洲軍參謀長美亞立即返華盛頓，要求羅斯福總統對斯蒂維爾與蒙特巳頓間予以調停，關於此事，美國合衆社曾作詳細報道。過去英美問因利害衝突，而戰略不一致，贗見不鮮，但此次意見紛歧，使統一戰綫瀕於被裂，故問題頗大，尤使重慶徘徊於去就之迷途。日駐華艦隊報道部長松島　三大佐，五日就此事，會對記者圑發表談話如次：</p>
<p>終於造成一次悲劇　　略謂自此次世界大戰勃發以來，英美在戰略上之不一致，迭經暴露無遺，祇圖私利之聯合軍內慕，醜態畢露，但英美為掩飾比　　態，不惜數度為召軍政目腦部會議一，惟每次會議，紙足以俞益表現英美兩國間利害之衝突，所謂戰後問題云云，徒使識者齒冷。此次蒙特巴頓司令部與斯蒂維爾司令部間之作戰意見，發生紛歧，東南亞洲反軸心軍參謀長美亞，遽然返華佔頓，要求羅斯福裁定，此於吾人見之，於魁見克會的結果而已。於魁貝克會砍中决定設置之東南亞洲軍司令部，最初未能作大規模反攻作戰，行動殊為消極，屢受日軍先發制人，終於造成第二次阿拉坎悲劇。但英方為瞞過世人耳目，公布虎偽戰况，如邱士爾竟致電祝賀蒙特巴頓，誠是一幕滑稽劇，然洞悉眞相之美國人民，對美國在太平洋上付莫大犧牲，熱中於反攻作戰，而英國電不饗應之事，認為不足驚奇。前次麥克沃塞曾力言為謀　被日本，必須擊潰中國大陸之日本兵力，此言或係針對蒙特巴頓而發者，麥克沃塞之意見，與驅使渝軍以中國大陸為根據地對日反攻之斯蒂維爾如出一轍，故囑渝方重開　緬公路。但此種希望，因蒙特巴頓之消極作戰，未能實現，致斯蒂維爾顔面全失，對蒙特巴頓大表憤慨，此亦為英美變方固執意見之直接原因，固可斷言者。</p>
<p>利害衝突暗　日深</p>
<p>英美哉戰略上，所以引起對立者，根木因英美兩國各為將來利益一，各自行動，蓋美國之戰略，係根據霸制世界之野心，處處可見其　極態度，謀乘戰爭機會，　奪英國權益·美國所以援助英國者。亦　眼於此。茲舉一例，可證明之，去秋美國上院議員却特拉會稱，美國援助英國，英國當然應付相當代價云云，尤其美國存心以確保航空路綫，因之英美間為此問題，暗關日深。據最近華盛頓電報，美國務　會向英蘇提議，召開非公式會議，以使商討戰後航空政策云，美國在淪設置空軍，其目的之一，亦在謀將來獨佔中國大陸之航空路。又美國對西亞油田地帶，虎視耽耽，計　在阿拉伯敷設輸油管，這英人猛烈反對，甚至連美國報紙及石油財閥，亦抨　木國政府之不富。且美國為　絡金融財閥，擬在巴勒斯坦建造猶太國，因之問題亦引起與英國間之衝突。然而英國為求美國援助軍火，亦不能不順從美國意思，甚至對美國之向英帝國最大財源之印度發展，亦抱客忍態度，而美國乘英國之弱點，以租軍法案為耳，使英國入其　中，三日之美下院外交委員會席上美陸長史汀生，要求將租軍法案限期延長一事，其用意即在於此</p>
<p>美國野心不一而足</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Pressing Towards Indian Border, Burma Battle Enters Critical Phase: Indian National Army Advances Step by Step Towards the Motherland</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) - A dispatch from a certain base on the Burmese front, dated the 5th, states: Japanese forces on the southern Burma-India border have decimated the British 7th Division and are now approaching the Indian border, indicating that the Burmese battle situation has entered a new phase. Since assuming command of the Southeast Asia anti-Axis forces, Mountbatten has continuously convened military conferences and traveled to Chongqing to discuss counter-offensive plans in Burma with Chiang Kai-shek, He Yingqin, Chen Cheng, and others, suggesting that the Burmese battle situation will become even more pressing after the Lunar New Year. However, with the Japanese forces' skillful defense, they defeated the Chongqing forces in the northern battle of the Nu River. Following the defeat at the Nu River, Mountbatten adopted a gradualist approach, hoping to first secure control of the airspace over all of Burma, then retake Burma, and finally advance into the southern Japanese-occupied areas. However, after the Japanese forces initiated preemptive strikes, they were annihilated under fierce artillery fire. Furthermore, the Indian National Army, rising up to liberate their motherland, is now uniting with Indian soldiers who surrendered to the Japanese and advancing step by step towards their homeland. India, Britain's only treasure trove in East Asia, is now facing a political crisis. Seeing the unfavorable situation, the British Southeast Asia Allied Forces Commander, Mountbatten, hastily reinforced troops to obstruct the Japanese advance towards Chittagong and exerted all efforts to defend a certain point on the Indian border. This demonstrates that the situation on the Indo-Burmese border has entered a critical phase. Once the Japanese forces advance into India, the state of India will be uncertain. After the Japanese forces launched an offensive operation against Arakan, the battle situation has changed dramatically. The enemy's propaganda about counter-attacking Burma has now become a complete fantasy, and they are instead preoccupied with preventing a crisis in India.</p>
<p>Shonan, 5th (Central News Agency) - Since the Indian National Army launched an offensive in Arakan, Indian residents in various southern regions have become highly excited. The Indian Independence League-related newspaper, "Azad Hind," published an editorial on the 4th, titled: "The Indian National Army are all striving to oppose Anglo-American imperialism, seek the liberation and independence of the motherland, and expand their strength. The Provisional Government of Free India is recognized by nine countries, including Japan, China, and Germany, which not only acknowledges the existence of India but also recognizes mutual cooperation. For example, Japan supports India's independence and actively provides assistance in exercising its rights. Furthermore, to fulfill this commitment, it is engaging in warfare against the enemy, Britain and America. Burma is now exerting all its efforts to provide assistance, and the Burmese people, along with the National Army of the Provisional Government of India, are joining hands with the Indian National Army. Recently, the three armies of Japan, Burma, and India established a rapid communication channel to strengthen their joint operations. This measure has increased the credibility of the Indian National Army's independent existence. Indian soldiers are fighting under British orders, while the Indian National Army is fighting under the command and orders of the Japanese. At the same time, Indian soldiers under British command are subjected to discriminatory treatment in terms of salaries, food, and clothing. Moreover, Indian soldiers under British command are forced to fight, while the National Army is fighting for the liberation of their motherland as a matter of justice. Indians with spirit will never sacrifice themselves for the enslavement of their motherland. We firmly believe that the entire Indian National Army and its allied forces will march in unison, attack Delhi, and thoroughly eliminate British imperialism."</p>
<h3>German Naval Expert Comments: American Military Strategy in the Pacific War is Extremely Dangerous</h3>
<p>Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) - The naval correspondent of the "Marine-Rundschau," Erlwatt, wrote: "The battles in the Mariana Islands indicate that the American military strategy is to strengthen its offensive on both the naval and land fronts, and then seize air and naval bases along Japan's outer defense line. This strategy has been in progress for several months and is extremely dangerous because the Americans believe they have a larger navy than the Japanese and can afford significant losses. The Americans use ten aircraft carriers and eight battleships each time, indicating their intention to engage in a decisive battle with the Japanese navy. The American plan seems to be to seize various bases because the Japanese navy does not… and the Japanese military does not appear for combat at other bases in the Mariana Islands. But this objective of the Americans has not been achieved. Most of the Japanese navy does not appear for combat, but the adaptive measures taken have made it impossible for the American air force, based on aircraft carriers, to operate. For example, only 200 American planes can be dispatched to bomb the Mariana Islands and Guam. The strength of the American fleet is also being diminished daily, while the Japanese navy is preserving its strength and can wait for an opportunity to strike. This is the advantage held by the Japanese navy."</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Heavily Bomb Suichuan and Hengyang</h3>
<p>Hankou, 5th (Central News Agency) - Japanese army air units heavily bombed Suichuan on the night of the 4th and returned safely to their base. The bombing took place at 10 PM, first in Suichuan, where they engaged in combat with enemy fighter planes, then heavily bombed our airfield, destroying one enemy large aircraft and one small aircraft, severely damaging two others, destroying one medium aircraft and four to five small aircraft. That same night, despite adverse weather conditions, they raided Hengyang, targeting the airfield and its runways. After achieving great results, the Japanese planes returned safely to their base.</p>
<h3>Japanese State Minister Kishi Visits Chief Secretary Hoshino</h3>

<h3>Japanese Emperor Visits Naval Headquarters, Lunches with Chief of Naval General Staff Shimada</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) - Following an appearance at the Naval War College in the afternoon, the Japanese Emperor, accompanied by Grand Chamberlain Admiral Hasunuma and Prince Matsudaira, departed from the Imperial Palace by automobile at 10:20 AM and proceeded to the Naval War College in Shinagawa Ward to personally attend the graduation ceremony for students of Class A and related students. The ceremony was extremely grand. After the ceremony, he departed from the school at 11:15 AM and proceeded to the Naval Headquarters, where he lunched with Chief of Naval General Staff Shimada and other staff officers. Prince Takamatsu also attended. He returned to the palace at 1:05 PM.</p>
<h3>North China Political Affairs Commission Thoroughly Investigates Hoarding</h3>
<p>Beijing, 5th (Central News Agency) - Since the Lunar New Year, prices in Northern China have been rising again, even doubling or tripling in some cases. According to common sense, this situation is due to a few people profiting from it, which affects the lives of the people. After the authorities in Beijing implemented investigations, prices have gradually fallen. The Political Affairs Commission has dispatched special commissioners to Tianjin, Qingdao, Tangshan, Shijiazhuang, and other places, informing the local administrative officials of the investigation in Beijing. It has been confirmed that there is large-scale hoarding in various places, which is being investigated. Regardless of whether they are pure merchants or colluding with the enemy, the goal is to stabilize prices.</p>
<h3>Beijing Students Demand Suppression of Harmful Entertainment</h3>
<p>Beijing, 5th (Central News Agency) - Yesterday afternoon, the Beijing Youth League expressed their opinions vehemently, hoping for concrete answers based on factual evidence.</p>
<h3>American Ambitions Fully Exposed, Chongqing Side Feels Pessimistic</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 5th (Central News Agency) - America's policy of aggression towards China is becoming blatant, while the Chongqing side is groaning in distress. Initially, they used the abandonment of unequal treaties and the amendment of Chinese immigration laws to deceive people, or used force to coerce the Chongqing side, etc., using various conspiracies to incite delayed counter-attacks in Burma, blaming Britain, and inciting resentment in the Chongqing side towards Britain, secretly and gradually revealing America's ambition to exclusively occupy China. America's true intentions towards China can be briefly summarized from the following political, military, and economic activities:</p>
<p>Annexing the Air Force</p>
<p>The most obvious of America's military actions towards China is the formation of the U.S. Joint Air Force in Chongqing last December. America's plot to annex the Chongqing Air Force is well known. On the one hand, they accommodate and train Chongqing Air Force personnel, intending to expand the power of the American Air Force stationed in Chongqing, thereby reducing the difficulty of replenishing its air force officers. Since the beginning of the year, the patriotic fervor has been deliberately stirred up by American intelligence agencies. After receiving some basic training within the group, they are incorporated into American teams in Burma, providing their wisdom for nothing. Such actions, which infringe upon the command authority of Chongqing, have also aroused dissatisfaction in Chongqing. Due to this, Chongqing's autonomy and military command are restricted by the Americans. Chongqing has already been reduced to a military colony of the United States, which is obvious. In addition, the recent expansion of American forces to the southwestern provinces of Chongqing and the situation of American military activities in Burma further confirm that this is not false. According to a Chongqing dispatch, Stilwell recently established a (K) Country Operations Headquarters in Burma, commanded by Frankton. This headquarters is actually the operations guidance headquarters for the Chongqing army in that area. The remnants of the Chongqing army that were defeated in Burma are being trained in India by American officers under American command. Therefore, this new organization has been established, and Stilwell has taken control of the command of the Chongqing army in that area. America is not only expanding its military power but also using its golden hands to entice the Chongqing side to borrow 500 million U.S. dollars, of which 200 million are in gold, intending to control the Chongqing side.</p>
<p>U.S. Dollars Flood the Market</p>
<p>Furthermore, the recent influx of U.S. dollars has caused extreme chaos in the financial market, which shows that this is the most sinister scheme of the Americans to colonize Chongqing's economy. According to regulations, these U.S. dollars, except for charitable donations, are not allowed to be transported to Chongqing. However, because prices in China are high, the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing and American expatriates decided to fix the exchange rate between U.S. dollars and Chinese currency at one U.S. dollar to twenty Chinese currency units. But according to last year's black market, one U.S. dollar could be exchanged for eighty Chinese currency units, and recently it has risen to one hundred and eighty Chinese currency units. Moreover, this situation is greatly desired by Americans and related businesses, and even the Chinese are talking about U.S. dollars, expressing a pessimistic outlook. Everyone is competing to produce goods. This situation cannot be ignored, but the American side does not care at all, fearing that the Chongqing side will not quickly be colonized economically. The complete loss of autonomy by the Chongqing side and its willingness to be an appendage of the United States are foreseeable.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops on the Burma-India Front Drive Straight to Chittagong</h3>
<p>Since last October, Mountbatten's Southeast Asian Allied Forces have begun to move, calling for the recapture of Burma from the west. Their Fifth and Seventh Divisions attempted to invade the Arakan region but were lured by the Japanese army's strategic retreat. A portion invaded the Maungdaw area. However, since the second offensive, they have achieved results, and the enemy's two divisions have been completely encircled within the iron ring of the Arakan front. Their annihilation is imminent. (According to the war results announced by the Japanese Headquarters on the 4th of this month, the Indian-British 7th Division has been largely annihilated.) At the same time, they have indicated that they will drive straight in and seize Chittagong, causing great terror on our side.</p>
<p>The enemy's 7th Division, encircled in the Akyab Basin, ten kilometers north of Buthidaung, has a force of approximately 5,000 men, carrying 100 tanks and 500 trucks, forming a solid defense in a one-mile radius and resisting. On the 13th and 14th, due to the Japanese army's ground and air attacks, the enemy was completely surrounded. On the other hand, the Fifth Army, using tanks and carrying medium-caliber artillery, attempted to invade Maungdaw, but its connection with the 7th Division had been severed, and its retreat route to Chittagong had been cut off. It is heavily deploying medium-caliber artillery north of Maungdaw and defending its position. A portion of the enemy has urgently begun to retreat by boat from southern India.</p>
<p>However, the Japanese air force has begun bombing them, and the Dunkirk tragedy will be repeated in Arakan. It is worth noting that the enemy air force's records show a sharp decline. The dive bomber squadron flew approximately 270 sorties in January, but has recently greatly reduced its activity, taking the opportunity to drop food to the enemy ground troops within the encirclement. According to enemy intelligence, the enemy has been forced to dispatch air force rescue units to the Bay of Bengal and the Arakan coast to rescue pilots who have landed. A repetition of the Arakan tragedy seems unavoidable. The London Daily Telegraph reported:</p>
<p>"The Arakan war is the most intense war in the world. The Allied nations have not yet concentrated enough forces to launch a major offensive in Asia. British-Indian Army Commander-in-Chief Auchinleck believes that the Japanese army will eventually enter India and will use all means to contain the pressure on the British army on the Burma front."</p>
<p>He expressed great fear of the Japanese army's operations. Governor-General Wavell said:</p>
<p>"My first task is to assist the commander of the Southeast Asian Army to drive the enemy out of the gateway to India. Without crushing Japan's ambitions, India will have no peace or glory."</p>
<p>He is exerting all his efforts to cooperate with Britain in carrying out the war. However, the anti-British movement within India is becoming increasingly intense, following the advance of the Indian National Army under the command of Subhas Chandra Bose in Arakan. (Report from the Western Asahi Shimbun, February 22)</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Not Being an "American Comrade"</h3>
<p>We have been advocating frugality for almost a year. At first, everyone merely published editorials in the newspapers, and then the Newspaper Federation contacted other organizations to jointly initiate the establishment of a Frugality Association, stipulating frugality regulations for further practical implementation. However, all we can do is to fulfill our responsibility of persuasion. We hope that everyone, while enjoying themselves, will think about the consumption of national resources and think about those compatriots who have no enjoyment, and therefore reduce all unnecessary waste. Over the past year, we have said many things and written many articles, but when it comes to achievements, we feel very ashamed.</p>
<p>For ordinary middle and lower-class compatriots, coping with daily life is already very difficult, so there is naturally no question of unnecessary waste. However, the extravagance and luxury of ordinary middle and upper-class compatriots are still apparent to everyone. The talk of frugality cannot defeat the psychology of enjoyment, moral exhortations are useless, and all the empty talk of saving national resources is useless. The atmosphere of waste, in terms of society, profoundly reveals the inequality between rich and poor, unconsciously causing people to develop resentment, and unconsciously guiding people to take the road of making money through corruption. In terms of the country, it is the countless waste of resources, and the waste of countless people's energy and time for no purpose. During wartime, consuming even a little more energy yourself is increasing the strength of the enemy, which is a great loss. Since the forces of social control cannot make people frugal, only the coercive power of the government can be effective.</p>
<p>Recently, on February 25, the Japanese cabinet decided to suspend specific requirements for luxury enjoyment, the contents of which were seen in the March 1 Tokyo Central News Agency dispatch in Japanese newspapers. The two most noteworthy points are: one is that it was planned by the government, and the other is that it was implemented immediately. (Implementation began nationwide on March 5) Under the wartime system, the Japanese government's spirit of saying and doing is truly admirable. Therefore, we hope that our government will have the determination to issue the same order to suspend luxury enjoyment.</p>
<p>Of course, the existence of luxury entertainment venues is of no benefit to the nation and its people during wartime. If it is said to be for tax revenue, then please compare the tax revenue figures with the figures for the consumption of materials to see which is more cost-effective. If it is said to be for the livelihood of the employees, then please compare the livelihood of the employees with the degradation and decadence of people caused by enjoyment, etc. Which is more important in terms of spiritual and material losses? Entertainment venues and their affiliated employees are a type of occupation in society, and we naturally should not oppose them. But what time is it now? Should the people be indulging in enjoyment? War is a great era, a major turning point in an era. What should be eliminated should naturally be eliminated without hesitation, and what should be reformed should naturally be reformed immediately.</p>
<p>Yesterday, this newspaper published an article from the Japanese Asahi Shimbun titled "Reviewing the Must-Win Life," in which it said: "People do not go to work in factories even with a slight illness because they earn so much and live a leisurely life. Those who call on the people to 'reform their lives and desperately increase production' during the day, luxuriously host banquets at night." To regard such people as "American Comrades" is such a profound irony. We hope that our compatriots, especially the middle class, will take heed of the irony of the phrase "American Comrades" and practice frugal consumption.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry Plans to Revitalize Light Industry</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency) - In order to revitalize light industry, promote increased production, and adapt to the wartime economic system, thereby balancing people's livelihoods and ensuring stability, the Ministry of Industry previously sent personnel to Shanghai, Hangzhou, Wuxi, and other places to inspect the actual production of various cotton mills and their difficulties. The adjustment work was completed at the beginning of last month. Currently, emergency relief measures are being studied with relevant parties based on the actual situation, and they will be implemented as soon as a concrete decision is made.</p>
<h3>Agricultural Production Increase Conference Prepares Work Plan</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency) - The Agricultural Production Increase Promotion Committee of the Executive Yuan has scheduled the following work promotion plan for early this month: The Executive Yuan will promulgate agricultural production increase project plans for each province and city. The Ministry of Food will transfer agricultural production agencies to train technical personnel. Each province and city will be designated to convene meetings of agricultural agencies and related personnel, as well as individual talks in each county and district. Specialists will be appointed to promote agricultural production increase and revitalization in each province and city. Cooperative societies for agricultural production and sales will be promoted in each area. Seedlings in each province, city, and county should also be repaired in the spring.</p>
<p>Domestic Briefs</p>
<p>Hebei designates counties for increased production: Baoding, 5th (Central News Agency) - The Hebei Provincial Government has recently designated 54 counties as key areas for increased production based on natural factors such as soil and climate, as well as other necessary conditions, to implement increased production of wheat, coarse grains, cotton, aquatic products, and sugar beets.</p>
<p>Wuxi registers stored rice</p>
<p>Wuxi, 5th (Central News Agency) - The Suhu District Office of the Rice Management Association originally planned to purchase 0 packages of rice in the near future, but the amount purchased so far is far from the original standard. To investigate the exact number of rice in storage for merchants who have not paid the purchase amount, personnel were dispatched to various collection commercial firms yesterday. In addition, in order to understand the truth about the depletion of crowd sources, the association will also fully register the rice stored by rice merchants throughout the county.</p>
<h3>On the Former Polish Border, the Soviets Mass Heavy Troops: The War Tends to Become White-Hot Again</h3>
<p>Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) - Transocean News Agency: The battles at various focal points on the Eastern Front have tended to slacken. Before long, it will be known whether the reason for the slackening is the arrival of the muddy season, or whether it is intended to pause to transfer new reserves. A recent, comparatively strong attack was south of Narva, with the Soviet forces advancing to the north, south, and west. The enemy advancing south only advanced 200 meters, while the other two routes were blocked. In the Nevel area, the Soviet forces attacked Linna Fortress, but without much success. The fighting at the junction of the central and northern fronts is gradually becoming a stalemate. In the salient of Velikiye Luki, the Soviet forces are using heavy artillery fire and are expected to intensify their attack soon. On the southern front, the Soviet forces at Krivoi Rog and Kirovograd, although massing large numbers of tanks, are being hindered by the mud and have not yet been active.</p>
<p>Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) - The German military authorities discussed the Eastern Front situation on the 4th: In the area between Shpetovka and Lutsk, there was active local fighting. German grenadier units occupied several important locations.</p>
<h3>The United States Announces Severance of Relations with Argentina</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency) - According to a Washington report, Undersecretary of State Welles announced at a press conference on Friday that the United States and Argentina have severed relations, and the U.S. Ambassador to Argentina has been instructed to cease diplomatic activities.</p>
<h3>Only Artillery Fire on Anzio Beachhead</h3>
<p>Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) - The German High Command reports that the battle at the Anzio beachhead was relatively calm on Friday, not as intense as in recent days, but artillery fire continued.</p>
<p>Rome Suffers Bombing, 600 Killed</p>
<p>Rome, 5th (Central News Agency) - Reuter reports that Rome was bombed by Allied aircraft on the 3rd in an unprecedented major air raid, killing more than 600 people. More than 350 bodies have been excavated from one air raid shelter, and the rescue work has not yet been completed. Another air raid shelter contains approximately 150 bodies.

<p>Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency) - According to a Washington report, U.S. President Roosevelt explained the issue of the disposition of Italian warships when receiving reporters, stating that the Allied powers had previously negotiated to transfer one-third of the Italian warships that surrendered to the Allied forces, as well as other warships of equal quantity, to the Soviet Navy. This has now been agreed upon. Furthermore, Britain and the United States will control the majority of the remaining warships. Regarding the disposal of the Italian fleet, Roosevelt previously instructed the Soviet ambassador to the United States that "this decision is not merely temporary and may become permanent." There is no need to specify the number of Soviet warships or their establishment, but it can be stated that some of the crew members of the Italian surrender fleet were Italian soldiers, but some were formed by Allied soldiers. A member of Congress questioned whether the disposition also applied to the Italian warships that had fled to the Spanish-controlled Balearic Islands. Roosevelt replied that this was another issue and would be decided by Spain.</p>
<h3>President Takaishi of the Mainichi Shimbun Returns to Tokyo, Delivers Speech: Impressions of Surveying the South and Passing Through Shanghai Are Good</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) - President Shin-Goro Takaishi of the Mainichi Shimbun recently visited the South to survey the construction situation in various front-line locations such as Manila, Menado, Makassar, Palau, Guadalcanal, and Shonan, and also spoke with local military officials and civilians. Having completed his trip, he took a plane via Shanghai on the afternoon of the 1st and returned to Tokyo. According to Takaishi, his impressions of this trip were: The South is truly a land blessed by nature. When we went to the South on January 19, the weather was already extremely warm. The homes of the natives are mostly made of bamboo, while ordinary residences are made of brick and tile. The interior is extremely cool. Our group had a hot pot dinner with executives from the Celebes News Agency in Makassar, and we did not feel hot at the time. The climate in that area is very suitable for living, and there are no sudden changes from cold to hot. Newspaper offices in various locations are diligently governing the country and working hard. Newspapers also have reserves, with some having enough for a year. There are plans to manufacture paper locally, and some have already started manufacturing. Furthermore, I met with hundreds of army and navy officers in the Southern occupied areas. Although they are military personnel, the Southern areas have already established a self-sufficient system, actively reclaiming wasteland to increase food production. The Japanese army and navy personnel there are all full of confidence in victory and do not waver in the face of minor obstacles. Local newspapers have a Japanese katakana column, and the natives are eager to learn Japanese. Furthermore, they have no common language, so Japanese is likely to become widespread. It is not uncommon to see people who can now read Japanese and speak Japanese. The cooperation of Indonesians and overseas Chinese is also quite admirable. They need woven silk products such as skirts (worn by the natives of Java and the Moluccas) and undershirts, which are imported from Japan. I only stayed in Shanghai for three days this time and was warmly welcomed by the local Newspaper Federation. Among them, the presidents of the Chinese-Japanese Daily and the Central China Daily came to Japan to attend the Greater East Asia Newspaper Conference. I also invited Chinese journalists to hold a symposium, which was very well attended. They are also paying close attention to Japanese newspapers and are striving in their respective positions to complete the great undertaking of restoring China and protecting East Asia as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>The Authorities Actively Proceed to Thoroughly Stabilize Prices by Starting to Assist Production, Management and Consumption</h3>
<p>Various authorities in this city, in order to fully suppress and stabilize prices and adequately allocate major commodities, have now obtained close cooperation with the highest authorities of both China and Japan. Concrete measures have been successively formulated, deciding to assist production and manage consumption, so that production and consumption can be balanced. Furthermore, in order to address both symptoms and root causes, strictly monitor merchants' buying and selling, and guide the commercial market onto the right track, it has been decided to manage the entire price level according to new countermeasures. All retailers in various industries must not raise prices privately, change grades of goods, use inferior or mixed goods, or engage in other improper behaviors. If a business has a real need to change the selling price due to cost reasons, it must submit the reasons to the authorities through the relevant trade association and request a change in the price limit; otherwise, it will be considered an illegal price increase.</p>
<p>The Grain Bureau Summoned Trade Associations for Talks</p>
<p>In order to maintain Shanghai's food supply and stabilize prices, the Grain Bureau specifically scheduled a discussion meeting with the chairpersons of the Grain Trade Association at 10:30 AM on the 7th of this month at the bureau. The Bureau Chief, Ji Hua, attended and sought cooperation from various parties. In addition, in order to distinguish between the Grain Trade Association and the grain merchants participating in the association, the Ministry of Food has specifically formulated "A Categorized Table of Elite Business of Various Grain Trade Associations," and issued it to food bureaus in various provinces and cities, instructing local grain trade associations to comply. The Grain Bureau of this city has already notified the various associations accordingly.</p>
<h3>Matsushima, Reporting Minister, Discusses the Conflict of Interests Between Britain and the United States, A Strategic Inconsistency</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch: The former Anglo-American allied forces made extensive propaganda, claiming that the counter-offensive in Burma was a crucial key to determining the success or failure of the counter-offensive in East Asia. However, since its launch, there has been no progress. Their ambition was originally to attempt to recapture Akyab, but the result was severely attacked by the Japanese army. As announced by the Japanese Army Headquarters on the 4th, the enemy lost 7,600 personnel. This struggle not only exposed the US attempt to maintain contact with Chongqing and the British desire to preserve their source of exploitation, India, causing a rift between the two sides, but also clearly indicated a strategic inconsistency between Mountbatten, Commander of the Southeast Anti-Axis Forces, and Stilwell, Commander of the US Forces in Chongqing, due to the "Arakan tragedy." The unified front between Britain and the United States in East Asia will trigger a crisis of collapse. Therefore, the Chief of Staff of the Southeast Asian Army, Meyer, immediately returned to Washington to request President Roosevelt to mediate between Stilwell and Mountbatten. The United Press of America has provided detailed coverage of this matter. In the past, strategic inconsistencies due to conflicts of interest between Britain and the United States were not uncommon, but this time the disagreement is so severe that the unified front is on the verge of splitting, so the problem is quite significant, especially causing Chongqing to hesitate about its future course. Matsushima, a Navy Reporting Minister stationed in China with the rank of Major, gave a speech to reporters on the 5th regarding this matter as follows:</p>
<p>Finally Causing a Tragedy. He stated that since the outbreak of this World War, the strategic inconsistencies between Britain and the United States have been repeatedly exposed without exception. The internal affairs of the Allied Forces, who only seek private interests, have been fully exposed. However, in order to cover up these shortcomings, Britain and the United States have spared no effort to convene military and political leaders' meetings multiple times. However, each meeting only served to further demonstrate the conflict of interest between Britain and the United States. The so-called post-war issues only made those in the know sneer. This time, the operational opinions between Mountbatten's headquarters and Stilwell's headquarters have diverged. The Chief of Staff of the Southeast Asian Anti-Axis Forces, Meyer, suddenly returned to Washington to request a ruling from Roosevelt. From our perspective, this is merely the result of the Quebec Conference. The Southeast Asian Army headquarters, which was decided to be established during the Quebec Conference, initially failed to conduct large-scale counter-offensive operations, and its actions were very passive, repeatedly suffering from Japanese preemptive strikes, finally causing the Second Arakan Tragedy. However, in order to deceive the eyes and ears of the world, the British side announced false battle situations. Churchill even sent a telegram congratulating Mountbatten, which was truly a farce. However, the American people, who know the truth, are not surprised that Britain is not responding to the great sacrifices made by the United States in the Pacific and its enthusiasm for the counter-offensive. Previously, McWhorter had strongly stated that in order to defeat Japan, it was necessary to defeat the Japanese forces on the Chinese mainland. This statement may have been aimed at Mountbatten. McWhorter's opinion is the same as that of Stilwell, who drove the Chongqing forces to launch a counter-offensive against Japan based on the Chinese mainland. Therefore, he urged the Chongqing side to reopen the Burma Road. However, this hope was not realized due to Mountbatten's passive operations, causing Stilwell to lose face and express great anger at Mountbatten. This is also a direct reason for the rigid opinions of the British and American sides. It can be asserted that</p>
<p>The Conflict of Interest is Deepening</p>
<p>The reason why Britain and the United States have caused opposition in strategy is fundamentally because the two countries act independently for their future interests. America's strategy is based on the ambition to dominate the world, and its aggressive attitude is evident everywhere, taking advantage of the war to seize Britain's interests. The reason why the United States is helping Britain is also for this purpose. To cite an example, Senator Khattala of the United States said last autumn that the United States is helping Britain, and Britain should of course pay a corresponding price. In particular, the United States intends to ensure air routes, and therefore the secret relationship between Britain and the United States on this issue is deepening. According to a recent Washington telegram, the US State Department has proposed to Britain and the Soviet Union to convene an informal meeting to discuss post-war aviation policies. One of the purposes of setting up the Air Force in the United States is to monopolize the air routes of the Chinese mainland in the future. In addition, the United States is eyeing the oil fields in West Asia, planning to lay oil pipelines in Arabia, which has been fiercely opposed by the British, and even American newspapers and oil tycoons have criticized the government's lack of wealth. Moreover, in order to win over financial tycoons, the United States plans to build a Jewish state in Palestine, which has also caused conflicts with Britain. However, in order to seek US assistance in armaments, Britain has to obey the US will, and even adopts a tolerant attitude towards the US development of India, the largest source of wealth for the British Empire. The United States takes advantage of Britain's weakness and uses the Rent-Lease Act to trap Britain. The intention of US Secretary of War Stimson on the US House Foreign Affairs Committee three days ago to request an extension of the Rent-Lease Act is precisely for this purpose.</p>
<p>American Ambitions are Countless</p>
<p>America's various ambitions are endless, and a part of its own troops landed on New Britain Island, advocating for ownership, while Britain currently has no strength to carry out counter-offensive operations in East Asia. When the United States assists in the counter-offensive in the Pacific, it secretly hopes that the US advance speed will be slower, otherwise the merits will be completely seized by the United States. Mountbatten's lack of cooperation in the Burmese counter-offensive is also due to fear of this point. The British and American system is wide. It is heard that the Burmese counter-offensive will put Longzhong on the list. On the Indian side, a large-scale naval force is concentrated to obtain control of the Bay of Bengal, which was also stated by Mountbatten. However, why is this extremely sensible strategy not adopted by the United States? This is probably because the United States is paying a huge price for the Pacific counter-offensive and neglecting the East Asian counter-offensive plan. The most important purpose is to break into Burma and Malaysia. Therefore, it only lends weapons and drives Britain and the Chongqing side to fight, while it stays behind. However, the Japanese navy calmly responds and fights more bravely. The battle situation is as solid as a rock, and the enemy has no real strength to actively attack Burma. Therefore, Japan's war of righteousness will undoubtedly be under control.</p>

<p>Economic Sector</p>
<h3>Jiaotong Bank Negotiates to Invest in Agricultural Loans</h3>
<p>Planned to Issue Agricultural Financial Bonds</p>
<p>The Agricultural Economics Department of Jiaotong Bank is recently working to expand agricultural loan services and indirectly promote high production increases. It is secretly planning on the misappropriation of the loan fund. It plans to successfully obtain a RMB 10 million overdraft loan from the Central Reserve Bank, and after the funds are lent out successively, it will immediately study and issue agricultural financial bonds. The funds obtained from the sale of the bonds will be used to assist in the establishment of agricultural warehouses, reclamation, water conservancy, and agricultural cooperative credit unions for fruit-period loans, in order to complete the mission of handling agricultural gold journal services.</p>
<p>In view of the recent abundance of idle funds in the Shanghai market, the legitimate industrial and commercial sectors have not been able to fully accommodate them. Rather than allowing them to engage in hoarding and speculation, it is better to guide them to increase production in rural areas. Based on this point, it has successively conducted earnest consultations with the Shanghai financial community. As a result, those who are willing to cooperate with the bank to invest in agricultural loans include the China Agricultural Salt Storage Bank and the Li Min Bank. The two banks have decided to invest 2 million yuan each, and the bank itself will allocate 3 million yuan each. Other silver and money industry peers who are willing to conduct consultations with the bank include the Songjiang Silver and Money Industry Federation, the Shanghai Zhongxu Bank, and the Nanjing Huinong Bank. Therefore, the bank's future loan business is truly promising.</p>
<h3>Exchange Economists Should Settle Accounts Daily</h3>
<p>Otherwise, They Will Not Be Allowed to Enter the Market</p>
<p>In order to promote business and prevent abuses by brokers, the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange requires that all transactions made by brokers be settled clearly on a daily basis. It is hereby re-announced that all brokers must settle accounts clearly on a daily basis from March 7th. If any broker is unable to settle accounts clearly on the same day, they will be suspended from trading on the next day. All outstanding procedures from the past must be completed before March 7th, otherwise they will not be allowed to enter the market.</p>
<h3>Weekly Financial, Industrial, and Commercial Market Conditions</h3>
<p>The financial, industrial, and commercial market conditions in Shanghai last week have improved. Equity stocks and various commodity prices have turned from rising to falling starting from Friday. The Central Reserve Bank is preventing the movement of reclamation funds and gradually tightening the circulation of loans. Various banks are tightening their loan business, making it impossible for speculators to operate. Hoarders are forced to sell due to urgent cash flow. The authorities' measures to crack down on hoarding and stabilize prices have been effective.</p>
