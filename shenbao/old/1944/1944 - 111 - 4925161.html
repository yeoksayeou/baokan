<p>社評</p>
<h3>公務員的進修</h3>
<p>我們以往建議公務員的任用，應當取考試制度，公務員的生活，必須竭力設法使之安定，公務員的執行職務，必須廉潔認眞。此外我們更希望公務人員耍時時進修，刻刻進步。</p>
<p>「學而優則仕，仕而優則學」，是一句老話，可是中國人往往只做上半句，而忘了下半句。一般人「一行作吏」，即使原來有點學問，大概亦日就荒疏，更談不到進步。好像做官之後，就與學問脫離關係，公務人員懶於求知的情形，巳經成爲普遍的現象。要知道現在的世界，是一個日新月異的前進社會，做一個現代的人，若不能够與時俱進，立刻就要落倍。公務人員爲一國政治所　，比一般人更爲重要，落伍的公務人員，那裏能够做出前進的事務。所以公務人員缺乏進修糙神，可使他個人和國家都不能够進步。</p>
<p>這個風氣的造成，由來已久。造成這個風氣的原因，不外二點：一是職務內事務的不緊張，二是職務外娛樂的不正當。上衙門悠悠忽忽，出衙門沉溺邪侈，過去的人是這樣，現在新進的人自然模倣，多數的人是這樣，少數的人自然追隨。大家無形中都傳染着這個毛病，而病人本身，彼此司空見慣，反而不覺得這是病。在這種環境下，那裏談得到學問，那裏談得到進修。這種現象不僅見於公務機關，即在共他私人企業機關裹，近年來亦有很多發現。</p>
<p>要改造這個不良風氣，就需要有極的革新決心。耍使一般人有上進的精神，更需要有相當的督促力量。因爲「惡勞好逸」，人之常情，習慣自然，更是事實。自動既不可能，那末只有强迫的一法。主持的人應當以身作則，把事務緊張起來，他可以就現在的許多問題，敎他的屬員研究，耍脚踏實地的研究，不是「等因奉此」的官樣文章。從這裏，至持的人可以得到許多人的意見，可收集思廣益的效果。做事的人可以切切實實地做些學問功夫，强迫地要奮勉上進，要認眞讀書，要切實調查。他因此可以知道知識技能的需要，急切地要補充，方才能够應付。懶惰的變爲勤勉，虛浮的變爲樸實，散漫的變爲嚴肅，然後方能一新風氣。</p>
<p>公務人員業徐的補習敎育，更要普遍推行，認眞辦理，定出獎懲辦法，鼓勵進修人員。規定學程，定期考試，以作官職升降的標準。這樣，至少可以減少職務外不正當的娛樂時間，使從事於進修，至少可以使平時醉生夢死的人員，爲他的前程着想，不得不努力增加知識，至少可以使整個機關裏面的學術空氣，慢慢地濃厚起來，多有切磋觀糜的機會。</p>
<p>公務人員是一個國家政治的推動者，他的知識技能愈提高，政治推進的力量愈大。我們希望公務人員的知識，永遠能够隨時代的進展而提高，那末國家政治亦永遠能够隨時代而進步。所以公務人員的進修，是對國家對自己最最迫切的一件事。</p>
<h3>印境戰事與　萊杜公路的危機</h3>
<p>日軍以破竹之勢進擊，英印軍誇爲防衛印度之大本營伊姆怯爾，指顧可下，印度國民軍協力日軍，浩浩蕩蕩開入祖國大地。此次日印同盟軍的閃電作戰，顯然爲對反軸心陣綫的一個大」　，由於伊姆怯爾的必將失陷，重慶政權將感受無限的痛苦。</p>
<p>公路價值重大</p>
<p>伊姆發爾的陷落，已經成爲時間問題，這是直接對重慶所恃爲輸血路的萊社公路加以決定的打擊。萊杜公路的價值，因爲有阿薩姆，孟加拉鐵道的存在，伊姆法爾，哥希馬間道路被日軍遮斷之後，接連伊姆法爾公路的阿薩姆·孟加拉鐵道將大感威脅，這事實，可說是與鐵道有內外一體關係的萊杜公路，其危機一天天緊迫起來。過去半載以來，駐渝美空軍以英印軍不足　，自行在北緬富賀區械出擎，以及前次溫開特少將指揮的空中挺進隊之降落作戰，都是爲了確保萊杜公路的反攻。</p>
<p>萊杜公路本來是從阿薩姆·孟加拉鐵道的終點　地亞起，經萊杜·在密芝那入雲南省騰越，出保山而接通舊細甸路的第二緬甸路。乃該方面駐印渝軍及美陸軍部隊唯一的補充路。第一次歐洲大戰後，英國所計劃的萊杜·莫伽希爾間之預定鐵道綫，該公路即依該綫建築。由於該公路的完成，企鬧打開援蔣及補充駐渝美空軍之隘路，而積極從中國大陸侵攻日本。工事在阿拉斯加公路的建設者阿爾·翁薩史密斯的指導之下，動員駐印渝軍及從重慶空輸的許多勞力，畫夜趕築，敵方宣傳該公路爲「到東京去的路」，可見敵方對該公路致極大的期待。</p>
<p>空中運輸無濟</p>
<p>現在對重慶及駐渝美空軍的運輸，是從頓斯基亞越喜馬拉耶高峰經北部緬甸而達昆明，即所謂「空中援渝路」。祇因是空中運輪，其運輪力極小，且因日空軍的邀擊，最多祇能補充駐淪美空軍，而對於增强渝軍戰力，殊覺無補。所以確保萊杜公路是當前防止重慶脫離反軸心陣綫，實現駐淪美空軍空襲日本野心的唯一路　。因此，此次萊杜公路的陷於危機，對重廢的物質與精神兩方面的打擊，不言可喻。</p>
<p>三月二十七日，日軍戰鬥轟炸機聯隊曾矗炸萊杜，頓斯基亞間的笛克浦鍊油所（萊杜油田）。該油田爲印度唯一生產高燃燒價石油的地方，爲補充駐淪美空軍及重慶需要的油田。最近且計劃從笛克浦到〇〇敷輸油管，該鍊油所的破壞，給與重慶極深刻的影響，愈加强重慶的焦燥與苦悶。</p>
<p>對印態度如何</p>
<p>更可注目者，駐印渝軍以何爲抗戰理由，而對標榜解放祖國的印度國民軍交戰呢？對印度的獨立，今後將處以同種態度呢？重慶內部的混亂，跟着印度獨立運動的進展而愈趨深刻。本月四日鮑斯氏所發表關於建設自由印度的第二次聲明，更加甚重慶內部的動搖。這樣，日印同盟軍的進擊印度，對反軸心陣線，尤以重慶政權，給與決定的影響。印度與重慶，現在正顯出了建設與崩潰的一明一暗二種狀態。（翔：譯自四月九日東京讀賣報知）</p>
<h3>沿加拉頓河北上　日軍佔巴雷特瓦　伊姆法爾盆地展開奪戰</h3>
<p>東京二十三日中央社電　據加拉頓前綫日軍某基地二十三日電：日印同盟軍迫擊敗敵，進略加拉頓北方之陣綫後，更自此河盆地北上，十七日夜突破米薩瓦及比譬瓦，以破竹之勢進迫該方面之最大要衝巴雷特瓦。（Paletwa）二十日傍晚終於突破巴雷特瓦而將之佔領。加拉頓河右岸北上之日印同盟軍分成兩縱隊，繼續前進，十五日奪取加拉頓北方九公里之五二四高地，十六日奪取那喀恩爾，進至巴雷特瓦，日印同盟　隔河相呼應之地點，敵軍之力已瀕混亂。</p>
<p>東京二十三日中央社電　印緬前綫某基地廿二日電：日軍精銳部隊突入伊姆法爾盆地之一角後，敵軍之抵抗亦行頑强，刻日軍爲粉碎伊姆怯爾之圓形要塞防禦綫，正以極精妙之步兵戰怯，集世界之視聽，展開鍛壯烈之攻奪戰。此南北卅公里許東西十公里許防衛伊姆法爾之圓形陣地，與夫敵以步砲聯合步隊守禦之一大野戰陣地究爲何耶。蓋英印軍第四軍自夢想奪回緬甸以來，乃於去年雨期過後，構築印緬國境山脈要塞，更在圍繞伊姆法爾之丘陵地帶，作一弧形防禦錢，造成以戰車大砲爲中心之輸型陣地，以之爲在戰略上對日本步兵攻擊之反攻據點。</p>
<h3>敵佈置輪型陣不堪日軍一擊</h3>
<p>伊姆法爾附近岡陵綿旦，但僅高數百米，密林亦多，以故自伊姆法爾外視作戰陣勢，建造比陸上輪型陣地，謀阻口軍之猛攻，實會就伊姆法爾盆地四周地形及印細國境獨特地形之特點加以考察。所謂輸型陣地者，乃集中野砲山砲速射砲機關砲及重機關槍等一切火器，配備於陣地之中心，外環戰車，更外側則以部隊配置於放射狀之數縱陣中，構成一圓陣般之陣地，即以火砲羣與步兵羣編成之輸型陣，此一輸型陣與其他輪型相連絡，更作一大輸集合此輸型陣，使伊姆法爾盆地成爲一大圓型要塞，而輸型陣在道路及三叉路口等要衝，更特作聯珠狀，以備即使被日軍切斷各個輸型陣，亦得藉空中之接濟而支持相當期聞。輸型陣並非所謂永久要塞，現在已逐次爲日軍砲火之威力與巧妙戰術攻陷，尤其因守禦輪型陣者有英人與印人之差別，故軍力不齊，殊使敵軍深感苦惱。最近輪型陣地僅由印兵兵守禦，愈不堪一擊。</p>
<h3>日山本次官視察　華北蒙疆各地　對增强生產指示甚詳</h3>
<p>北京二十三日中央社電　日山本大東亞次官一行，於本月七日抵此以來，即赴華北蒙疆各地視察。對各地重要產業之改善，作種種之指示，視察完畢，返抵北京。二十一日下午五時半，假北京飯店接見記者，發表談話，大意謂余於視察華北蒙疆各地，深感各地在增強戰力及安定民生上，必能獲致所預期之成績。此次視視察時會詳細檢討增強生產上之種種困難，並就其應改善各點，分別加以指示。相信今後各地當能按照所指示者，作種種改善。華北輕金屬生產，如　土等，亦極堪期待，蓋華北　土實可冠絕世界。今後爲期其更進一步之發展，巾央與地方當局更應作密切聯絡。又訊，日山本次官等一行，於視察各地達業完畢後，巳於廿三日返抵東京云。</p>

<h3>會長林春雄氏抵滬</h3>

<h3>歐陸大戰將臨　德具必勝信念　西歐防軍正嚴陣以待</h3>
<p>柏林二十三日中央社電　值茲反軸心歐洲登陸空氣正濃之際，德「人民觀察報」特於二十二日評述第二戰綫與東綫之關聯·並披瀝必勝之信念如次：東綫平靜狀態，非永遠繼續，不日或又將展閉大戰，三四兩月中一再　步於蘇軍，此在襯軍固不無打擊，但戰綫則無寗謂已對德軍有利。德軍司令部刻正對一切事態，作萬全之準備，東線德軍士氣更非常激昻。關於第二戰綫如今春或今夏開始登陸作戰，而蘇軍亦開始攻擊，則必是雙方空前未有之大軍遭遇一起，演出慘絕人寰之激戰，斯時世界大戰當達極峯，並可決定歐洲民衆之命運，德國民正以確信等待該時期之到來</p>
<p>柏林二十三日中央社電　海通社訊：怯境德軍上目將領下至士卒，莫不深知難關在前準備克服之。西歐大軍遍布各省及集中於沿岸各區，大砲位及機關槍巢莫不準備就緒，軍事警報亦已演習多次，每一砲手均熟習應敵之方，訓練工作亦未嘗中輟。在長久之期待中，多數兵士不特成爲特種兵器之熟手，且練就各種作戰方法。各處戰場之經驗，尤以義戰線之經驗均加採用防衛力。吾人對一切難關均已準備妥善，沿岸各點哨兵隨時偵察船隻行動，並立即報吿。吾人深知前途事態，敵人將竭其威力傾莫物力，以求於此決一雌雄，但吾人已準備萬全</p>
<h3>義境或將發動　牽掣攻勢</h3>
<p>瑞典京城二十三日中央社電　據斯堪的那維亞通信社訊：德軍當局方面關於反軸心軍之西歐登歐方面之反軸心軍登陸作戰已極迫切，德軍司令部曾預測反軸心軍於西歐登陸作戰之同時，於意大利方面亦必將展開新攻勢，意大利戰線納吐諾橋頭堡之美軍，現正陸續增加新銳部隊，此或系預備於義北部登陸之象徵。</p>
<h3>在英美軍演習　登陸作戰</h3>
<p>瑞典京城二十三日中央社電　海通社訊：駐英之攻歐美軍，於周初舉行演習，如登陸戰事撤退傷兵等。英美高級將領及駐英之美軍副總司令李約翰中將均在塲參觀。</p>

<h3>傳蘇聯軍隊　將開義戰綫</h3>
<p>米蘭廿三日中央社電　德國新聞社訊，南義若干報紙昨日述及鍛近巴里之無綫電消息，力言以前所傳蘇軍將開赴南義前綫一節，在不久之將來將見諸實行。蘇軍開赴義大利一事，乃根據海軍部長特科爾頓與空軍部長賽達利所提出之建議，關於此事有一點頗堪玩味者，即莫斯科方面要求此等軍隊須由獨立之蘇聯司令指揮，而不願處於英軍領導之下。</p>
<h3>暴風雨前夕東綫暫寗靜　雙方軍隊調動頻繁</h3>
<p>柏林　三日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：蘇軍攻勢現陷於停頓狀態，在另一方面德軍之攻勢亦屬局部性質，其目的僅在改養陣地，此爲東綫數月來比較平靜之時期。自下德軍斥埃隊正忙於偵察在未來之進攻中，蘇軍司令部將在何處並以多少實力展開其師團，現已獲得相當完備之意象。蘇軍除在南路之北部與中路集中其部隊外，並在聶斯特下游集合生力軍，蘇軍後方亦有頻繁之軍隊調動，但此項調動因天氣不佳而受阻碍，此即東綫目下平靜之原因，在此平靜之幕後，現正進行未來大規模戰爭之種種準備。至於德軍方面在前綫各平行區，亦有軍隊不斷之調動，但其目標尙不可知，但由其師團之人數，可知此等分隊並非屬於西歐北歐或南歐各戰綫者，此等强大而配備元善之分隊似屬於東綫之後備隊。柏林軍界人土對於此項軍隊所負之任務，不肯透露任何消息，但預料德軍正在作一切準備之措施。蓋蘇軍司令部似正在進行準備，以便在英美軍侵犯歐陸時，在東綫同時發動大規模之攻勢。德軍界人士認爲東綫目下之局勢，係「暴風雨前夕之平靜一。</p>
<h3>泰諾波爾區德軍突圍戰</h3>
<p>柏林二十三日中央社電　海通社訊：德軍在達諾波爾白盡則與敵軍苦戰，夜則進行避離行動，幾無片刻睡眠，以便突破敵軍之包圍綫，蘇軍在該處之兵力約有十一師之衆，並有堅强之坦克車隊爲助，直欲擊減該城之德守軍，但其中九師交戰迄今，受創其重，今已調至後方整理。蘇軍在白盡不斷猛攻德軍陣地，並縮緊包圍錢，德軍既須與之周旋，是以祗能在夜間將陣地後移，平均每夜可後移十二公里，即每一小時一公里，故無睡眠之時間也，士兵作戰極爲英勇。</p>
<h3>芬蘭拒絕　休戰條件</h3>
<p>莫斯科二十三日中央社電　蘇聯政府二十三日晨命塔斯發表：芬蘇政府間之和平交涉業已決裂瑞典京城二十三日中央社電海通社訊，莫斯科息，蘇外交副委長維辛斯基昨公佈芬蘭已拒絕蘇聯休戰條件。維氏在草斯科無綫電台報吿此項談判之詳細經過，謂過去數週間蘇芬進行談判，討論停戰之可能性，並稱芬蘭曾派代表團前來莫斯科，聆取蘇聯要求之正確意旨。據其報吿蘇聯堅持下列數端，　駐芬德軍予以圈禁，或於四月底以前驅逐出境。　佩查莫區與其港口割讓與蘇。　讓與芬蘭之礦區。　賠款六萬萬美元，惟蘇聯願放棄割讓漢哥地方之要求。而芬蘭政府之答覆則稱，僅爲技術上之原因，芬蘭不能接受此項要求，否則芬蘭將喪失獨立地位，此項要求所予芬人民之負担，將遠過其勝任能力，芬政府雖願與其東隣敦睦邦交，惟蘇聯之建議使之無法實現此種願望。蘇政府認爲芬政府已拒絕其休戰條件。</p>
<h3>挪威海港　發生爆炸</h3>
<p>奧斯陸二十三日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：據此間消息，卑爾根海港於星期四發生猛烈爆炸，死多人，損害頗重。爆炸發生於一停泊之駁船中，全市房屋皆被震動，海港地區受重大毁損，死亡確數現尚未悉，當局現正澈查爆炸之原因。</p>

<p>報告籌備經過</p>
<p>委員李祖　報告棉花增產協議總會籌備經過：「本年三月下句承實業部長派員頒示農業業進會議決通過之本年度棉花緊急增產補充計劃一件，　令在上海之各有關棉花機關團體負責人員，從速遵照計劃內開各節，籌備組織棉花增產協議總會，並江北鹽墾地區及其他地區協議會，以便協定棉花緊急增產之適當方策，並促進其實施。當經棉花統制委員會，蘇浙皖紗廠業同業公會，在華日本紡績業同業會上海支部，華中棉產改進會，江北綜合硏究所各機關團體，推出代表，互選籌備委員，迭開籌備會議，蒙實業部農林署署長陳燕山先生，全國經濟委員會顧問黑河山　先生，在上海盟邦大使館調查官森日出哉先生在塲指導。即由籌備會議所推之起草員，起草總會章程及江北鹽墾地區棉花開會協議會規程，及地區棉花增產協議會通則，當經籌備會議分別議决通過，並依據總會　程，預選總會委員。更由總會委員互選聞蘭亭先生為副會長，　侶靑堤孝兩先生為常務委員。嗣在籌備會議中有人提議主張組成份子內應加入棉花業公會及日商棉花同業會兩團體，當經議决通過，並預選曹啓明馮　生前田保男上松　先生為總會委員，惟依總會章程第四條之規定，該兩團體之加入，須俟本會成立後，方可承認，故議定俟成立大會通過總會章程時，倂請追認。計籌備會　共開八次之多，通過規章凡三件，理合連同並預選之總會副會長委員名單，請大會議决通過。」</p>
<p>陳部長致調詞</p>
<p>實業部陳部長致調詞略謂：「國民政府近年來對於農業增產策劃，非常重視，與積極推進除食糧之外，尤其棉花增產關係工業發展更為重大。如研究棉花增產收獲良好成績，對於棉花價格之調整與技術上之改良，必需集中有關棉業方而，共同協力，硏究推進不可。故棉花增產協議總會組成之意義，即在於此。目大東亞戰爭以來，國府戰時經濟政策在安定民生，確保軍需為目的，為達到此自的，必需緊急增加生產，是以棉花增產協議總會的使命，非常重大，希望在會各委員在聞副會長領導之下，協同研究棉花增產推進工作，把這目的達到。」</p>

<p>棉花增產協議總會於今日成立，為建設新中國前途計，誠不勝慶賀之至。自大東亞戰爭勃發後，華中棉花與華北棉花同為大東亞共榮圈內之棉在資源，其地位極為重要。查華中方面棉花以往原由華中棉產改進會就品種之改良及耕種法之改善等，從事增產，在目前情勢之下，尚感難以滿足，實有急謀量的增大之必要。故此次由棉花　制委員會等華中方面棉業各團體共同組織本會，由質量雙方謀棉花之積極改良增產。就現下切迫之東亞情勢而觀，誠係適合時宜之舉措。今後對於棉花增產工作，具有最重大關係者，為棉花收買價格問題，希望各位對於此點加以愼重檢討，在不肯保護棉農利益及振奮棉作意義之原則下，樹立適切價格政策，並考慮採取賢明而具機動性之收買方策，實為必要云。</p>

        <h1>1944 - n111</h1>
<h3>Advancement for Civil Servants</h3>
<p>We have previously suggested that the appointment of civil servants should be based on an examination system, that their livelihoods must be secured by all means, and that their performance of duties must be honest and diligent. Furthermore, we hope that civil servants will constantly learn and improve themselves.</p>
<p>"He who excels in learning can become an official, and he who excels as an official should learn," is an old saying, but Chinese people often only do the first half and forget the second. Generally, once someone "enters officialdom," even if they originally had some knowledge, it would likely become rusty over time, let alone improve. It seems that after becoming an official, one becomes disconnected from learning, and the lack of a desire for knowledge among civil servants has become a widespread phenomenon. It should be understood that the world today is a rapidly changing and advancing society. A modern person who cannot keep up with the times will immediately fall behind. Civil servants are crucial to the politics of a country, more so than the average person. How can outdated civil servants accomplish progressive tasks? Therefore, the lack of a spirit of continuous learning among civil servants can hinder the progress of both the individual and the nation.</p>
<p>This trend has been established for a long time. The reasons for this trend are no more than two: one is the lack of urgency in the work within their duties, and the other is the impropriety of entertainment outside of their duties. In the past, people idled in government offices and indulged in extravagance outside of them. Newcomers naturally imitate this, and the minority naturally follow the majority. Everyone unconsciously catches this habit, and the patients themselves, accustomed to it, do not even realize it is a disease. In such an environment, how can one talk about learning, how can one talk about advancement? This phenomenon is not only seen in government agencies but also increasingly found in other private enterprises in recent years.</p>
<p>To transform this undesirable trend, an extremely reformative determination is needed. To instill a spirit of progress in people, there needs to be considerable encouragement. "Disliking labor and liking leisure" is human nature, and habit is indeed a fact. Since self-motivation is impossible, the only solution is compulsion. Those in charge should lead by example and make the work more urgent. They can assign current problems to their subordinates for research, requiring grounded and practical research, not mere bureaucratic formalities. From this, those in charge can obtain many people's opinions and gather ideas for mutual benefit. Those doing the work can truly learn something, be forced to strive for advancement, read diligently, and conduct thorough investigations. As a result, they can recognize the need for knowledge and skills and eagerly replenish them to cope with the demands. The lazy will become diligent, the superficial will become practical, and the undisciplined will become serious, only then can a new atmosphere be created.</p>
<p>Supplementary education for civil servants after work should be widely promoted and seriously implemented, with rewards and punishments to encourage those who pursue further learning. Study programs should be established, and regular examinations should be conducted as criteria for promotion and demotion. In this way, at least the amount of improper entertainment outside of duties can be reduced, and people will engage in continuing education. At least, those who usually live in a drunken stupor will have to work hard to increase their knowledge for the sake of their future. At least, the academic atmosphere throughout the entire organization can gradually become more intense, with more opportunities for mutual learning and observation.</p>
<p>Civil servants are the drivers of a nation's politics. The more their knowledge and skills improve, the greater the power of political advancement. We hope that the knowledge of civil servants can always improve with the progress of the times, so that the politics of the nation can always progress with the times. Therefore, advancement for civil servants is the most urgent matter for both the nation and themselves.</p>
<h3>The India-Burma War and the Crisis of the Ledo Road</h3>
<p>The Japanese army is advancing with unstoppable momentum. The British Indian Army, which boasted that Imphal was the main base for defending India, is about to be taken. The Indian National Army, in cooperation with the Japanese army, is marching triumphantly into their homeland. This blitzkrieg operation by the Japan-India Allied Forces is clearly a major blow to the anti-Axis front. With the inevitable fall of Imphal, the Chongqing government will suffer immeasurable pain.</p>
<p>Great Value of the Road</p>
<p>The fall of Imphal, which is only a matter of time, is a direct and decisive blow to the Ledo Road, on which Chongqing relies for its lifeline. The value of the Ledo Road is compounded by the existence of the Assam-Bengal Railway. Once the road between Imphal and Kohima is cut off by the Japanese army, the Assam-Bengal Railway, which connects to the Imphal Road, will be greatly threatened. This fact means that the crisis of the Ledo Road, which is intrinsically linked to the railway, is becoming more pressing every day. For the past six months, the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing, due to the inadequacy of the British Indian Army, has been secretly equipping itself in the Fort Hertz area of northern Burma. The previous airborne assault operation commanded by Major General Wingate was also aimed at securing the Ledo Road for the counteroffensive.</p>
<p>The Ledo Road originally started from Ledo, the terminus of the Assam-Bengal Railway, passed through Ledo, entered Tengchong in Yunnan Province via Myitkyina, and connected to the old Burma Road through Baoshan, forming the Second Burma Road. It was the only supply route for the Chongqing army stationed in India and the US Army units. After the First World War, the British planned a railway line between Ledo and Mogok, and the road was built along that line. The completion of this road was intended to open a path for aiding Chiang Kai-shek and replenishing the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing, and to actively invade Japan from mainland China. Under the guidance of Al. H. Smith, the builder of the Alaska Highway, the construction mobilized the Chongqing army stationed in India and many laborers transported from Chongqing by air, working day and night. The enemy propaganda called the road "the road to Tokyo," showing the extreme expectation of the enemy for the road.</p>
<p>Air Transport Ineffective</p>
<p>Currently, transportation to Chongqing and the US Air Force stationed there is via the so-called "air supply route to Chongqing" from Dinjan over the Himalayas and through northern Burma to Kunming. However, because it is air transport, its capacity is extremely small. Moreover, due to interception by the Japanese Air Force, it can only replenish the US Air Force stationed in the besieged city at most, and it is of little help in enhancing the fighting power of the Chongqing army. Therefore, securing the Ledo Road is currently the only way to prevent Chongqing from breaking away from the anti-Axis front and to realize the ambition of the US Air Force stationed in the besieged city to bomb Japan. Therefore, the crisis of the Ledo Road will inevitably have a significant impact on Chongqing in both material and spiritual terms.</p>
<p>On March 27, a Japanese fighter-bomber squadron bombed the Digboi refinery (Ledo oilfield) between Ledo and Dinjan. This oilfield is the only place in India that produces high-combustion-value oil and is used to replenish the US Air Force stationed in the besieged city and meet Chongqing's needs. Recently, there have been plans to lay an oil pipeline from Digboi. The destruction of the refinery has had a profound impact on Chongqing, further intensifying its anxiety and depression.</p>
<p>What is the Attitude Toward India?</p>
<p>What is more noteworthy is why the Chongqing army stationed in India is fighting the Indian National Army, which is advocating the liberation of its homeland? What attitude will they adopt toward India's independence in the future? The internal chaos in Chongqing is becoming increasingly severe with the progress of the Indian independence movement. Bose's second statement on the construction of a free India, issued on the 4th of this month, has further intensified the internal turmoil in Chongqing. In this way, the Japanese-Indian Allied Forces' attack on India is having a decisive impact on the anti-Axis front, especially the Chongqing government. India and Chongqing are now exhibiting two states, one bright and one dark, of construction and collapse. (Xiang: Translated from the Tokyo Yomiuri Hochi, April 9th)</p>
<h3>Advancing North along the Kaladan River: Japanese Army Occupies Paletwa; Battle for Imphal Plain Unfolds</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) — A dispatch from a Japanese army base on the Kaladan front on the 23rd states: After the Japan-India Allied Forces decisively defeated the enemy and advanced on the line north of the Kaladan, they moved north from the river basin, broke through Misaung and Pipiwa on the night of the 17th, and advanced on Paletwa (Paletwa), the most important strategic point in the area, with unstoppable momentum. On the evening of the 20th, they finally broke through and occupied Paletwa. The Japan-India Allied Forces, advancing north on the right bank of the Kaladan River, divided into two columns and continued to advance. On the 15th, they captured Hill 524, nine kilometers north of the Kaladan, and on the 16th, they captured Nakakneil, advancing to Paletwa. The Japanese-Indian Allied Forces, responding to each other across the river, have thrown the enemy forces into chaos.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) — A dispatch from a base on the India-Burma front on the 22nd states: After elite Japanese troops penetrated a corner of the Imphal Plain, the enemy's resistance became fierce. Currently, the Japanese army is engaged in a magnificent and fierce battle to crush Imphal's circular fortress defense line, employing extremely subtle infantry tactics, and drawing worldwide attention. What exactly is this circular defense line, approximately 30 kilometers north-south and 10 kilometers east-west, which defends Imphal, and what is the large field position defended by the enemy's combined infantry and artillery? Since the Fourth British Indian Army dreamed of retaking Burma, it built a fortress on the India-Burma border mountains after the rainy season last year. Furthermore, it constructed an arc-shaped defense line on the hills surrounding Imphal, creating a radial-type position centered on tanks and artillery, which served as a counteroffensive base against Japanese infantry attacks from a strategic perspective.</p>
<h3>Enemy's Radial-Type Position Cannot Withstand a Single Blow from the Japanese Army</h3>
<p>The hills around Imphal are continuous but only a few hundred meters high, and there are many dense forests. Therefore, the operational posture viewed from outside Imphal is constructed as a land-based radial-type position to block the fierce attacks of the Japanese army, which is actually based on the unique terrain of the Imphal Plain and the India-Burma border. The so-called radial-type position concentrates all firearms, such as field guns, mountain guns, rapid-firing guns, machine guns, and heavy machine guns, in the center of the position. Tanks form the outer ring, and troops are deployed in several radial formations on the outermost side, forming a circular-like position. That is, the radial-type position is composed of artillery groups and infantry groups. This radial-type position is linked to other circular-type positions, forming a large radial-type complex, making the Imphal Plain a large circular fortress. The radial-type positions are specially constructed in a chain-like manner at key points such as roads and intersections, so that even if the Japanese army cuts off the individual radial-type positions, they can be supported by air supply for a considerable period. The radial-type position is not a so-called permanent fortress. It is now being gradually captured by the power of Japanese artillery fire and ingenious tactics. In particular, because there are differences between the British and Indian soldiers defending the radial-type position, the military strength is uneven, which has caused the enemy army deep distress. Recently, the radial-type positions are only defended by Indian soldiers, making them even more vulnerable.</p>
<h3>Japanese Vice-Minister Yamamoto Inspects North China and Mengjiang; Provides Detailed Instructions on Enhancing Production</h3>

<h3>Imminent War in Europe; Germany Has Confidence in Victory; Western European Defense Forces Stand Ready</h3>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) — As the atmosphere for an Allied landing in Europe intensifies, the German "Völkischer Beobachter" commented on the connection between the Second Front and the Eastern Front on the 22nd and revealed its belief in victory as follows: The calm state on the Eastern Front will not continue forever. War will break out again soon. The repeated setbacks in March and April against the Soviet army, although undoubtedly a blow to the Soviet army, have actually benefited the German army, as the front line is considered stable. The German High Command is currently making all-out preparations for all eventualities, and the morale of the German army on the Eastern Front is extremely high. Regarding the Second Front, if the Allied forces launch a landing operation this spring or summer, and the Soviet army also begins its attack, it will inevitably be an unprecedented encounter between the forces of both sides, resulting in a horrific and fierce battle. At that time, the world war will reach its peak and can determine the fate of the European people. The German people are awaiting the arrival of that period with confidence.</p>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) — Huitong News Agency reports: German generals down to the soldiers in the occupied territories know that difficulties lie ahead and are prepared to overcome them. The Western European army is deployed throughout the provinces and concentrated in coastal areas. Gun emplacements and machine-gun nests are ready. Military alerts have also been practiced many times. Every gunner is familiar with how to respond to the enemy. Training has never ceased. In the long period of waiting, many soldiers have not only become skilled in special weapons but also trained in various combat methods. The experience of various battlefields, especially the experience of the Italian front, has been adopted to enhance defense capabilities. We are well prepared for all difficulties. Sentries at various coastal points are constantly monitoring ship movements and reporting them immediately. We know the situation ahead. The enemy will exert its power and resources to the utmost to determine the outcome here, but we are fully prepared.</p>
<h3>Italy May Launch a Diversionary Offensive</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 23rd (Central News Agency) — According to the Scandinavian News Agency: As the Allied landing operation in Western Europe becomes extremely imminent, the German High Command has predicted that the Allies will also launch a new offensive in Italy at the same time as the Allied landing operation in Western Europe. The US forces at the Anzio bridgehead on the Italian front are continuously increasing new elite troops, which may be a symbol of preparing to land in northern Italy.</p>
<h3>US Forces in England Practice Landing Operations</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 23rd (Central News Agency) — Huitong News Agency reports: The US forces stationed in England who will attack Europe held exercises at the beginning of the week, such as landing operations and evacuating the wounded. Senior British and American generals and Lieutenant General Lee, Deputy Commander of the US Forces in England, were present to observe.</p>
<h3>British and American Planes Attack Germany; Over a Hundred Aircraft Shot Down</h3>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) — Military sources report: Last night, British and American bomber squadrons in several batches bombed the occupied areas of Western Europe and western and central Germany. A total of 122 aircraft were shot down, including 100 four-engine planes.</p>
<h3>Rumor that Soviet Troops Will Open an Italian Front</h3>
<p>Milan, 23rd (Central News Agency) — The German News Agency reports that some newspapers in southern Italy mentioned yesterday a radio message near Bari, strongly asserting that the previously rumored dispatch of Soviet troops to the southern Italian front would be realized in the near future. The dispatch of Soviet troops to Italy is based on the suggestion made by Navy Minister Teckelton and Air Force Minister Saidali. One point that is quite noteworthy in this matter is that Moscow requires that these troops be commanded by an independent Soviet commander and not be under British leadership.</p>
<h3>Temporary Calm on the Eastern Front Before the Storm; Frequent Troop Movements on Both Sides</h3>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) — The German News Agency reports: The Soviet offensive has now stalled. On the other hand, the German offensive is also of a limited nature, its purpose being only to improve positions. This is the most peaceful period on the Eastern Front in months. German reconnaissance teams are busy exploring where and with what strength the Soviet High Command will deploy its divisions in the future offensive, and a fairly complete picture has now been obtained. In addition to concentrating its forces in the north and central sectors of the southern route, the Soviet army is also assembling fresh troops in the lower reaches of the Dniester. There are also frequent troop movements in the Soviet rear, but these movements are hampered by bad weather. This is the reason for the current calm on the Eastern Front. Behind the calm, preparations are underway for a large-scale war in the future. As for the German army, there are constant troop movements in the parallel zones in front of the front line, but their objectives are still unknown. However, from the number of their divisions, it can be seen that these units do not belong to the Western European, Northern European, or Southern European fronts. These powerful and well-equipped units appear to belong to the Eastern Front's reserve force. Military figures in Berlin are unwilling to disclose any information about the tasks assigned to these troops but expect that the German army is taking all possible preparatory measures. It seems that the Soviet High Command is preparing to launch a large-scale offensive on the Eastern Front at the same time as the British and American armies invade Europe. German military figures believe that the current situation on the Eastern Front is "the calm before the storm."</p>
<h3>German Breakthrough Battle in the Ternopil Area</h3>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) — Huitong News Agency reports: German troops in Tarnopol fought bitterly with the enemy during the day and carried out evasive actions at night, with almost no sleep, to break through the enemy's encirclement. The Soviet army in that area numbered about eleven divisions, with strong tank forces to assist, aiming to reduce the German garrison in the city, but nine of the divisions that have fought so far have suffered heavy losses and have now been transferred to the rear for reorganization. The Soviet army is constantly attacking German positions in Tarnopol and tightening the encirclement. Since the German army must deal with them, it can only move its positions backward at night, averaging 12 kilometers per night, or one kilometer per hour, so there is no time for sleep. The soldiers fought extremely bravely.</p>
<h3>Finland Rejects Armistice Conditions</h3>
<p>Moscow, Central News Agency dispatch of the 23rd: The Soviet government issued a TASS statement on the morning of the 23rd stating: Peace negotiations between the Finnish and Soviet governments have broken down. Stockholm, Central News Agency dispatch of the 23rd, Huitong News Agency reports: Moscow news, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky announced yesterday that Finland had rejected the Soviet armistice conditions. Vyshinsky reported the detailed process of the negotiations on the Moscow radio station, stating that Finland and the Soviet Union had conducted negotiations in the past few weeks to discuss the possibility of a ceasefire, and that Finland had sent a delegation to Moscow to listen to the true intent of the Soviet demands. According to his report, the Soviet Union insisted on the following points: The German troops stationed in Finland should be confined, or expelled before the end of April; the Petsamo area and its port should be ceded to the Soviet Union; the mining area should be ceded to Finland; reparations of 600 million US dollars should be paid, but the Soviet Union is willing to give up the demand for the cession of the Hango area. The Finnish government replied that Finland could not accept this request for technical reasons, otherwise Finland would lose its independence, and the burden on the Finnish people would far exceed their ability. The Finnish government is willing to maintain good relations with its eastern neighbor, but the Soviet proposals make it impossible to realize this wish. The Soviet government believes that the Finnish government has rejected its armistice conditions.</p>
<h3>Explosion at Norwegian Seaport</h3>
<p>Oslo, Central News Agency dispatch of the 23rd: German News Agency reports: According to news from here, a violent explosion occurred in the port of Bergen on Thursday, killing many people and causing considerable damage. The explosion occurred in a parked barge, and the entire city's houses were shaken. The port area suffered heavy damage. The exact number of deaths is not yet known, and the authorities are investigating the cause of the explosion.</p>

<h3>Cotton Production Increase Agreement Association Established Yesterday - Constitution and Committee Member List Approved</h3>
<p>In order to promote the emergency increase in cotton production in Central China, the Ministry of Industry ordered relevant cotton organizations in Shanghai to form a Cotton Production Increase Agreement Association, and appointed Wen Guanting, chairman of the Cotton Control Committee, as the preparatory committee chairman to convene representatives from various organizations and institutions such as the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Cotton Yarn Factory Industry Association, the Japanese Textile Industry Association in China, the Central China Cotton Improvement Association, and the Jiangbei Comprehensive Research Institute to prepare for the meeting. The inaugural meeting was held yesterday (23rd) at 2:30 pm in the Xingya Building on the Bund in Shanghai. Attendees included Mr. Jun Hui, Director of the East Department of the Ministry of Industry and President of the Association, Vice President Wen Lanting, and all members. Officials from Chinese and Japanese institutions included Chen Yanyi from the Agricultural and Forestry Department of the Ministry of Industry, Liu Weijun, Director of the Insurance Appraisal Bureau, Huang Zhao from the Vocational Promotion Committee, Huang Bingxiang from the Trademark Bureau, Li Cheng, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Finance, and Zhang Feng from the Central Reserve Bank. From the Allied side were Minister Usami, Tatsichiro Funatsu of the Cotton Improvement Association, and over one hundred leaders from the Chinese and Japanese cotton yarn industries. After the ceremony, preparatory committee chairman Wen Lanting was elected as the temporary chairman of the meeting. After the opening speech and the report on the preparatory process by committee member and Secretary-General Li Zuchu, the constitution was approved and the list of committee members was selected, and the president and vice president took office. Then, Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry gave a speech, Minister Usami gave a speech, and guest Tatsichiro Funatsu gave a congratulatory speech. Finally, the vice president gave a thank-you speech, and the ceremony concluded with refreshments.</p>
<p>Chairman Wen's Opening Speech</p>
<p>In his opening speech, Chairman Wen Lanting said: "The emergency increase in cotton production in Central China is one of the most important administrative policies this year. Our National Government believes that this urgent task must bring together responsible persons from relevant cotton organizations to jointly discuss and decide on economically appropriate strategies and promote their implementation in order to achieve results. Therefore, Lanting and others were elected to prepare for the organization of the Cotton Production Increase Agreement Association. According to the constitution, the Minister of Industry is elected as the president, and the vice president and committee members have also been pre-selected at the preparatory meeting and should be approved by the general assembly. Lanting is the oldest member of the preparatory committee, so he has been elected as the temporary chairman of the general assembly. I would like to say a few words here. I believe that the decline in cotton production in various parts of China in recent years is due to various man-made reasons such as the excessively low price of cotton. This year, the government has decided to protect cotton farmers, and it is believed that the price of cotton this autumn will not be lower than the price of other crops. After the establishment of this association, we should request various effective strategies and promote their implementation in order to comfort cotton farmers and achieve the goal of emergency production increase. We are very pleased that Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry of the National Government, Minister Usami of the Allied Powers, and all Chinese and Japanese guests have taken the time to attend. We sincerely request detailed guidance so that we may follow it, and we are extremely grateful."</p>
<p>Report on Preparatory Process</p>
<p>Committee member Li Zuchu reported on the preparatory process of the Cotton Production Increase Agreement Association: "In the latter part of March of this year, the Ministry of Industry sent personnel to announce a supplementary plan for the emergency increase in cotton production for this year, which was approved by the agricultural industry advancement conference. The relevant cotton organizations in Shanghai were ordered to quickly prepare for the organization of the Cotton Production Increase Agreement Association and the Jiangbei Salt Reclamation Area and other regional agreement associations in accordance with the provisions of the plan in order to coordinate appropriate strategies for the emergency increase in cotton production and promote their implementation. Representatives from various organizations and institutions such as the Cotton Control Committee, the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Cotton Yarn Factory Industry Association, the Shanghai Branch of the Japanese Spinning Industry Association in China, the Central China Cotton Improvement Association, and the Jiangbei Comprehensive Research Institute were elected to form a preparatory committee and hold preparatory meetings. Mr. Chen Yanshan, Director of the Agricultural and Forestry Department of the Ministry of Industry, Mr. Kurokawayama, advisor to the National Economic Council, and Mr. Morihide Izukai, investigator at the Shanghai Embassy of the Allied Powers, provided guidance on the spot. The drafters elected by the preparatory meeting drafted the constitution of the general association, the rules of procedure for the Jiangbei Salt Reclamation Area Cotton Opening Conference Agreement Association, and the general rules for the regional cotton production increase agreement association, which were separately discussed and approved by the preparatory meeting. The general association committee members were pre-selected according to the general association regulations. Mr. Wen Lanting was elected as the vice president and Mr. To Qingdi and Mr. Takashi were elected as executive committee members by the general association committee members. Later, at the preparatory meeting, someone proposed that the Cotton Industry Association and the Japanese Cotton Traders Association should be added to the constituent members, which was approved by resolution, and Cao Qiming, Feng, Maeda Yasuo, and Kamimatsu were pre-selected as members of the general association committee. However, according to the provisions of Article 4 of the general association regulations, the accession of the two groups shall be recognized only after the establishment of this association. Therefore, it was decided to ask for retroactive recognition when the general association constitution is passed at the inaugural meeting. The preparatory meeting has been held a total of eight times, and three regulations have been passed, which should be submitted to the general assembly for deliberation and approval together with the pre-selected list of vice presidents and committee members of the general association."</p>
<p>Minister Chen's Keynote Address</p>
<p>Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry said in his keynote address: "In recent years, the National Government has attached great importance to and actively promoted agricultural production planning. In addition to food, the increase in cotton production is even more important for industrial development. If research on cotton production achieves good results, the adjustment of cotton prices and technical improvements must focus on all aspects of the cotton industry, and joint efforts must be made to research and promote them. Therefore, the significance of the establishment of the Cotton Production Increase Agreement Association lies in this. Since the Great East Asia War, the wartime economic policy of the National Government has been aimed at stabilizing people's livelihoods and ensuring military needs. In order to achieve this goal, it is necessary to urgently increase production. Therefore, the mission of the Cotton Production Increase Agreement Association is very important. I hope that all committee members in the association will work together under the leadership of Vice President Wen to study and promote cotton production increase work and achieve this goal."</p>
<p>Minister Usami's Speech</p>
<p>The establishment of the Cotton Production Increase Agreement Association today is a matter of great celebration for the future construction of a new China. Since the outbreak of the Great East Asia War, cotton in Central China and cotton in North China have become cotton resources in the Great East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and their status is extremely important. In the past, cotton in Central China was increased by the Central China Cotton Improvement Association through the improvement of varieties and cultivation methods. Under the current situation, it is still difficult to meet the demand, and there is an urgent need to seek an increase in quantity. Therefore, this association is jointly organized by the Cotton Control Committee and other cotton industry groups in Central China to seek the active improvement and increase of cotton production in terms of both quality and quantity. From the perspective of the current pressing East Asian situation, it is indeed a timely measure. In the future, the most important issue for cotton production increase work is the issue of cotton purchase prices. I hope that you will carefully review this point and establish an appropriate price policy under the principle of protecting the interests of cotton farmers and encouraging the significance of cotton production, and consider adopting wise and flexible purchase strategies. This is indeed necessary."</p>
<p>List of President and Members</p>

<h3>Economic Bureau Orders District Offices to Collect Cloth Purchase Certificates for Distribution to Citizens in Each District</h3>
<p>For the temporary allocation of cotton cloth in the city, the Municipal Economic Bureau has recently ordered each district office to quickly send personnel to the Fourth Section of the bureau to collect cloth purchase certificates. The order states: "Regarding the case of the city implementing the allocation of household cotton cloth, this bureau has obtained cloth purchase certificates from the Commercial Control Association according to the population within the blockade line of each district. It is hereby ordered that the district offices comply and quickly send personnel to the bureau to collect and distribute them to citizens in each district for purchase. This matter concerns population-based allocation and should not be falsified in any way. The handling situation should be reported for record-keeping." It is expected that the temporary allocation of cotton cloth in this city can be transferred to citizens by the district offices within days, who can then go to designated retailers to purchase it. According to reporters, the total population reported by each district office to the Economic Bureau is 3,452,227, including 2,372,500 in the first district, 71,750 in the second district, 147,000 in the third district, 55,987 in Xuhui Town in the fourth district, 21,906 in the fifth district, 173,552 in the sixth district, and 400,9532 in the seventh district. Compared with the 3,090,000 cloth purchase certificates issued by the Commercial Control Association, there is still a shortage of 362,227 certificates. It is currently reported that the authorities are rushing to make up the difference.</p>
<h3>Authorities Pay Attention to the Quality of Coal Briquettes</h3>
<p>In order to strengthen the allocation mechanism of designated retailers in each district, the Municipal Economic Bureau recently issued an investigation form for designated retailers. The bureau has collected more than 120 copies of the investigation form for designated retailers of matches, soap, and coal briquettes in Nanshi and Zhabei. It is learned that the bureau is cooperating with relevant authorities to pay attention to whether the goods distributed by each retailer are adulterated or replaced, and whether the weight is reduced. Once the facts are verified, they will be severely punished according to law, and citizens are also encouraged to report any violations. As for the recent discovery by citizens that the household coal briquettes purchased are adulterated, or mostly broken, and difficult to burn, when asking the coal briquette retailers, they said that they were directly sent from the factory and there was no adulteration. The reporter specifically visited the person in charge of the Economic Bureau about this, who said that the authorities are currently sending personnel to pay attention to the quality of the goods distributed by each retailer at any time, and ordered each coal retailer to pay attention to the quality of the coal briquettes delivered by each manufacturer. If the weight is insufficient or the quality does not meet the standards set by the authorities, they can refuse to accept them, and order each manufacturer to submit the sample of the coal briquettes to the authorities for review at any time. Therefore, the quality of household coal briquette allocation will be improved in the future.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry Sends Personnel to Shanghai to Inspect Various Factories</h3>
<p>In order to actively promote industrial recovery and prosperity, the Ministry of Industry has specially sent the ministry's technicians You Yizhao, Counselor Hu Qiao, An Zhengren, Wu Zhongda, and Qiu Jinyi to Shanghai to guide the city's workers to strive to increase production. The supervision includes the improvement of factory equipment and technology, the control of raw materials and electricity, and the adjustment of production prices. It is learned that after the personnel arrived in Shanghai, in order to understand the actual situation of each factory, they went to the Daming Match Factory, the China Match Factory, the Shanghai Match Raw Material Factory, the China Chemical Industry Factory, the Wuzhou Guben Soap Factory, and the Star Soap Factory on that day, inquired in detail about the business conditions of each factory, the production and sales situation, and the key points of the current demand for raw materials and fuel, and instructed the current maintenance of business and promotion steps. These personnel will draft a specific plan to supervise production based on their observations and impressions, and prepare to submit it to the Ministry of Industry for approval and implementation. It is heard that the mission of these personnel to Shanghai to supervise industry is first the match and soap factories, which are daily necessities, followed by the paper, glass, and textile industries, and other major factory supervision tasks.</p>
<h3>Sales Products Must Not Stop Wholesale</h3>
<p>The Western industry has a great relationship with the health of the citizens. Recently, it has been heard that various medicine merchants have requested the authorities to adjust the price of certain medicines for various reasons such as cost relations. During this period, the pharmaceutical factory stopped the wholesale of the marked medicines, and the pharmacies actually had the situation of hiding goods and refusing to sell them. According to this situation, it not only violates the original intention of the authorities to suppress and stabilize prices, but also indirectly endangers the health of the people, and should be stopped as soon as possible. It is now learned that the authorities concerned will conduct strict investigations if the above situation is discovered again in the future. At the same time, a small number of pharmacies have not strictly abided by the authorities' regulations that various medicines must have clear markings. The authorities will also take appropriate measures against these pharmacies.</p>
<h3>Epidemic Prevention Committee Holds Inaugural Meeting - Promoting Comprehensive Epidemic Prevention Work</h3>
<p>The Municipal Epidemic Prevention Committee is the general hub for coordinating the implementation of epidemic prevention work in the city. After the Epidemic Prevention Committee returned to the capital, it was presided over by the Allied Powers. Since the establishment of the Central Health Department last year, the Allied Powers have handed over epidemic prevention matters to China in order to respect our country's sovereignty. The Central Epidemic Prevention Committee was established last month. In order to ensure the smooth implementation of epidemic prevention work, the Tai Municipal Government, in accordance with the provisions of Article 12 of the organizational regulations of the Central Epidemic Prevention Committee, formulated the organizational regulations of the Shanghai Special Municipal Epidemic Prevention Committee and submitted them to the Municipal Government for approval. The position of Chairman is concurrently held by Mayor Chen, and the position of Vice Chairman is concurrently held by Director Yuan of the Health Bureau. Chen Yidao, Zhu Yanggao, Su Jizhi, Xie Jieyang, Chen Yeqin, Zou Yihe, Shen Jinxin, Toshio Shibata, Kiyoshi Matsuba, Saemon, Yoshiaki Tashiro, Isamu Nagai, Ichiichi Kon Lieutenant, Shigeo Taishan Lieutenant, and Wataru Shigeru have been appointed as executive committee members, and Fu Ying, Sun Lifu, Su Chengde, Liu Yangshan, Naka Torasaburo, Liang Xiuyu, Lin An, and others have been appointed as committee members.</p>
<p>The meeting was held at 4:00 p.m. at the Rihua Club at 30 Xianyang Road in the city. The meeting was held in accordance with the procedure. First, the Secretary-General gave a speech on behalf of Mayor Chen, and then Director Yuan gave his opinions, urging everyone to work hard to promote comprehensive epidemic prevention work in order to prevent the occurrence of immunity and seek social welfare. Then, Committee Member and Secretary Chen Yidao reported on the preparatory process, and the draft organizational charter and the cholera epidemic prevention implementation regulations were discussed on the spot, which ended at 9:00 p.m.</p>
<h3>Universal Injection Starts Next Month</h3>
<p>The Health and Cleaning Movement Committee, jointly formed by the Public Works Department and the Health Department of the First District Office, has prepared a detailed plan for street cleaning and resident sanitation in the city, which will be implemented one by one. At the same time, the committee has formulated epidemic prevention and cleaning measures in order to prevent the spread of epidemics in the upcoming summer. Starting from the first day of next month, a city-wide universal epidemic prevention injection will be launched. At that time, all special vehicles, patrol troops, and injection personnel of the Health Department, as well as all major hospitals in the city, will be fully mobilized. This kind of situation not only violates the original intention of the authorities to suppress and stabilize prices, but also indirectly endangers the health of the people, and should be stopped as soon as possible. It is now learned that the authorities concerned will conduct strict investigations if the above situation is discovered again in the future. At the same time, a small number of pharmacies have not strictly abided by the authorities' regulations that various medicines must have clear markings. The authorities will also take appropriate measures against these pharmacies.</p>
<h3>Personal Enthusiasm - Subsidized Loan Funds</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Mr. Luo Hongyi, Chairman of Tailai Money Bank, sent a personal subsidized loan of 300,000 yuan to the police consumer cooperative, and Mr. Luo introduced Mr. Xu Changchun and Mr. Zhang Shishu to each subsidize loans of 100,000 yuan. I deeply admire the enthusiasm for public welfare and the importance attached to social security. The subsidized funds have been transferred by this newspaper to the Sino-Japanese Industrial Bank for collection and storage.</p>
<h3>Yoshida Dong Concerned about Salt Famine in This City</h3>
<p>In order to solve the problem of salt scarcity, the salt industry in this city recently petitioned the authorities and appealed to various legal entities for assistance, making every effort. Yesterday, the person in charge of the industry specially visited the famous political commentator Mr. Yoshida Dong. He was received and asked in detail about the current difficulties in the salt market, and promised to present all the situations in person and convey them to the relevant authorities of the Allied Powers for consideration and improvement of the methods so that the daily life needs of the citizens can be rescued.</p>
