<h3>星期評論決戰議會</h3>
<p>— 闞光澤</p>
<p>日本第八十五屆臨時議會，於九月七日開會，會期凡五日，會議經過，已見各報。我認爲這次日本議會的舉行，出席的議員與政府官吏，在一個共同的中心目標之下，推誠商討，如何加強團結民力，如何盡量發揮總力，如何確保必勝態勢，完成最終目的？這一個共同的中心目標，就是在此大東亞戰爭已入最後決戰階段，必須使用最大最高的力量，爭取最後勝利。所以，我們對於這次議會，可以稱之謂[決戰議會]。　　其次，這次議會是小磯內閣成立以後的首次議會，自小磯首相以次各閣僚，更共同感覺受命於重大時局之中，責任綦重，對此加強全國團結總力的議會，自然更加寄以熱烈的要求。同時，各議員也感於時局日益嚴重，對此政府熱烈要求的議會，自然更願貢獻最大的助力。所以，這次議會的舉行，在政府與議員相互的熱情之下，必定充滿着緊張的熱情與諒解的摯誠，懇切商討，其收獲之偉大，自非偶致了。　　這次日本議會中，特別感到深刻印象的，第一就是日本政府在此決戰階段對於民衆力量之重視。第二是對於與論的尊重。因而結果在議會中也獲得一致的擁護與協力，使其一切政策得以貫澈。九月九日的[每日新聞]就特別指出，[小磯內閣之尊重議會，傾聽其言論的熱意，可謂凌駕從來諸內閣]。在政府方面，於瞻顧當前時局及四周情勢之餘，對於議會及其言論，絕無絲毫諱忌與規避的心理。這正是本身健全的政府所應有的表現。政府與議會都能捨棄主觀觀念，共起而謀保衛祖國維持三千年來的立國精神，集中全民力量，以戰鬥迎接未來的決戰勝利。　　小磯內閣關於尊重輿論一點，尤有具體的表現，首相在議會中率直宣示，政府[深刻信賴國民之忠誠心，暢達輿論，無蔽國民之耳目]。這一宣示更給議會以好感。松村議員譽之爲[循此大道，爲政之根本存焉]。安藤正純氏在議會中更暢談[言論暢達之道]，指出尊重輿論，暢達民意，則全國人民將油然而興其自發的戰意。他引證古諺所謂：[夫國有三不祥，野有賢而不知，一不祥也；知而不用，二不祥也；用而不任，三不祥也]，因而呼籲當局進一步改善輿論對策，尊重民意，信賴國民，結果終爲政府所採擇。我們在這裹欽佩日本有這樣忠諫的民間領袖，更欽佩日本有這樣虛心傾聽民意而眞誠尊重的當局。我們從這裹可以斷言，只有在這種人民敢諫和政府納言的朝野協力之下，只有如日本這次決戰議會所表現的官民密切合作態勢之下，國家政治才會上軌道，國家的政策才會澈底實現。我們於論述日本這次決戰議會之成功，並樂觀東亞戰局前途之餘，對於中國朝野各方面，不能不作更熱誠的期待！</p>
<h3>洛勒爾總統布告對美英兩國宣戰菲律賓全土劃分九戒嚴區</h3>
<p>馬尼刺二十三日中央社電　菲律賓大總統洛勒爾氏，二十三日上午十時，於官邸宣言，菲律賓共和國自二十三日上午十時起，與美·英兩國入於交戰狀態，茲錄其宣戰布告文如次：[菲律賓國民，於過去受外國支配下之期間中，爲獲得自由與獨立，會繼續努力，爲達成此目的，並會戰爭兩次，不斷發起革命，至一九四三年十月十四日，菲律賓多年宿願之自由與獨立遂得達成。其後菲律賓共和國大總統，會廣對全世界呼籲親睦與和平，尤對美國，要請不可於菲律賓作軍事行動，使炎害波及菲島，美·英國國雖受此請，但仍由高空侵入菲律賓若干地域，侵害共和國之領土保全，並殺傷菲律賓人民，破壞菲律賓人民財產，現在菲律賓共和國已不得不奮起衛護其獨立與領土之完整。菲律賓共和國爲保持其獨立與領土，已與日本締結相互尊重主權與領土之日·菲同盟條約，因此，今次菲律賓共和國大總統洛勒爾於一九四四年九月二十三日上午十時，已與美·英兩國入於交戰狀態，際此戰局緊迫之際，余於此歷史的瞬間，特由衷志，要求全國民支持政府，盡國民之最大忠誠，吾等之經騐或於最近之將來受有辛酸，然吾等必須於鞏固團結下，擁護菲律賓之自由與獨立]。　　馬尼刺二十三日中央社電　菲律賓總統洛勒爾氏，爲防衛國土，維持治安，乃根據菲國憲法第二條第二項之規定，令全國自九月二十二日上午九時起施行戒嚴，於戒嚴令施行之同時，大總統即得掌握重要之政治權，限將菲律賓全土立即分爲九戒嚴地區，其中七區任命當地行政長官爲戒嚴司令官，並任命其隷下之市長，縣長代理地方戒嚴司令，其他二區爲馬尼刺市長，任第八地區，內務次官任第九地區之戒嚴司令官，各戒嚴司令官得依刑法鎭壓區內之叛逆變亂暴動之徒，以維持一般之安寗。</p>

<p>中政府聲明　　南京二十三日中央社電　菲律賓共和國爲防衛國土，維持獨立，毅然奮起，對美英宣戰。國民政府特發表聲明，表明協力菲國完遂戰爭之意，原文如下：菲律賓共和國政府，最近因敵美橫施轟炸，態勢日趨嚴重，爲保衛國土，及維持治安，特於本月廿二日，發出全國戒嚴令，並於翌日布告參戰聲明，與大東亞各國家各民族互相提携，切望予以協力，一致共向擊滅美英之途邁進。國民政府獲悉之餘，深爲欣快。我大東亞戰爭，又加添一支生力軍，是最後勝利定屬我人，可以預卜。菲律賓原爲大東亞之一員，過去因受敵美之侵略壓迫，不能自拔，幸逢盟邦日本，發動大東亞戰爭，始得脫離英美之桎梏，而獲得解放。乃於去年十月十四日宣布獨立，成立共和國政府。我國民政府即予正式承認。大總統洛勒爾承戰亂之後，一面與日本講信修睦，一面致力於內政之整理，以期完成獨立之宿願。此次爲防衛祖國，擁獲獨立，毅然參戰，以必勝之信念，立於第一陣綫，俾大東亞戰爭之本質，愈爲明瞭有力。我國民政府對此，決本過去友好之精神，予以全面之協力，共同擊滅英美，使世界正義及永久和平早日實現，特此聲明。</p>
<h3>日政府聲明</h3>
<p>東京二十三日中央社電　菲律賓共和國，對美·英宣戰後，日政府二十三日下午一時十五分，由情報局發表聲明如次：菲律賓政府，九月二十三日業已對美·英宣戰，值此大東亞戰局日益緊急，步入決戰之際，一千八百萬菲律賓國民，爲防衛國土，擁獲共榮之獨立，毅然興起，對其宣戰，理由於該國政府之宣戰布告中，亦充分言明，日本對此洵爲同情。菲律賓國自去秋獲得光榮之獨立以來，洛勒爾大總統即躬親領導全國民衆，內則着着整備內政，對外與日本及大東亞圈內各友邦講求緊密協力，此次毅然立於擊滅英美之第一綫，正與大東亞各國家，各民族團結一致，爲解放東亞而奮鬥，實爲有史以來之盛事，東亞之復興，洵屬可期，日本帝國對維持菲律賓之名譽獨立，完成菲律賓防衛國土，衷心冀念，今後將更堅固與該國提携，基於日·菲兩國同盟條約，對菲律賓國不惜盡最大協力，進而協力完遂戰爭，擊滅英·美，以來實現建設大東亞目的，爲此，日本政府對內外發表所信。</p>
<h3>意義極重大</h3>
<p>南京二十三日中央社電　菲律賓共和國向英美宣戰，消息傳出後，吾國上下，無不榮幸。國府最高當局，及日本政府，均發表聲明，表明與菲國全面協力，完遂戰爭。菲島至去年十月，始在日本熱誠援助下，償其獨立之夙願。敵美企圖積極反攻，逞其侵略東亞野心，因此東亞各國奮起防衛東亞，打擊英美島急要應盡之義務。吾國與泰國亦先後參戰，緬甸於去年八月對英美宣戰，印度亦已向盤踞祖國之敵人進擊，今菲律賓直接參加擊滅英美之戰，大東亞各國家民族全面奮起，完成東亞十億總進軍決勝體制。吾人對迷夢未醒依賴英美之渝方，實不能不作嚴正警告，應深自反省，毅然掙脫英美桎梏，與全東亞人協力驅逐東亞英美勢力。吾人當在國府最高當局領導下，對戰爭作高度協力，獲致東亞永久和平。</p>
<h3>菲日軍指揮官昨發表觀感</h3>
<p>馬尼刺二十三日中央社電　駐菲日本陸海軍最高指揮官，二十三日發表觀感如次：菲律賓共和國本日對美·英布告宣戰，立即入於交戰狀態，其意義蓋在摧毀英美侵略東亞之野心，解放東亞各民族，保持東亞永久之和平，溯自去歲十月菲律賓獨立以來，根據日·菲同盟條約，依奉共同防衛本義，貢獻戰爭，英·美暴戾不達夢想再度隸屬菲律賓，用作侵略東亞根據地，竟殘殺其民衆，傷害其廬舍，是以菲政府與全國民衆一致奮起，應此挑戰，而宣告決對此東亞共同之敵人入於交戰狀態。日軍今欲以鐵壁之布陣，擁獲菲律賓獨立政府，刻正滿持待發準備，毫不留情，摧毀敵軍之一切，乃最後之勝利者，望菲國民信賴日軍之武威，作全面之協力，並鼓起不屈不撓，擊破暴敵之鬥志，以完成確立東亞和平之大業。</p>
<h3>大本營昨發表日軍佔領梧州精銳部隊並已攻入南</h3>

<h3>渝方承認梧州失陷</h3>
<p>里斯本二十三日中央社電　據美聯社駐渝訪員二十二二日訊，兩廣省境方面戰況如次：重慶軍委會發言人，會於二十二日承認日軍已將西江右岸之梧州佔領，現日軍正向西方繼續前進，此可看做對柳州方面開始之進攻。又日軍別動部隊自雷州半島向東北方進攻，已突入廣西省內，佔領容縣（梧州西南九十五公里）。據有識者談稱，假如梧州與容縣之間隙，一旦對閉，則日軍可把握自海南島經梧州至香港之一道弧形陣綫，如此則廣東將一變而爲日軍對抗美軍，在中國沿岸登陸計劃之一大攻防地區云。</p>
<h3>溫州南方日軍戰果</h3>
<p>日軍前綫某基地廿三日中央社電　浙江省日軍，十九日夜以來，對溫州南方渝第三十三師第一團，及浙江保安隊第四團約二千人，加以攻擊，將之擊潰。此役日軍收獲戰果，計渝軍遺屍一一五具，被俘十二名，日方損失僅戰死一名。</p>

<h3>葉局長報告本市公用行政記者例會昨日舉行</h3>
<p>市宣傳處於昨日舉行第二十次記者例會，出席各報社通訊社記者十餘人，由梁處長主持，並請公用局葉局長賴科長出席，解答各報社記者提出各項有關本市公用行政之問題，及先由葉局長報告公用局過去及最近之工作情形，致詞如下：</p>
<h3>接收辦理車輛事務</h3>
<p>一查本局奉令統一管理全市公用行政，時間爲今年二月，最先接管者爲陸上交通事項，其他碼頭廣告等項，亦先從舊八區方面着手，次第接收，嗣後一八兩區合併，本局事務亦隨之日見進展，統一工作乃告完成。其中陸上交通事項，最爲複雜，分述如下：○接收警察局辦理車輛事務，及中區辦事處成立經過，與改變，本年二月十六日，本局奉令接收前第一警察局辦理車輛事務後，經即成立中區辦事處於馬當路，內設三組辦理總務，水電，車輛事宜，前一八區原有公平路江寗路（即戈登路）長興路（即盧家灣）照會間，改設車輛登記所，並將第一警察局一部份之辦理車輛人員九十餘人，暫行借用，藉資熟手。嗣於八月一日全市統一後，本局乃將中區辦事處撤銷，另設車輛登記所於該處，專事登記自用人力車及三輸車，連同以上三處登記所，統屬於科，直接管理，所有借用警察局人員，巳於六月底以前，分批由第一警察局調回，另由局委任正副主任負責辦理之]。</p>
<h3>統一牌照整理車軸</h3>
<p>○辦理方針，當本局於二月十六日接收後，會定有方針三，一爲整理統一全市車輛牌照，擬以二月至五月三個月爲期，二爲整理各種車輛，以五月至十一月六個月爲期，三爲整理全市交通標誌，以十一月至三十四年一月三個月爲期。乃本局於接收後第一步之統一，各種車輛牌照，因前第一區財政處與廣大鐵工廠所訂承製磁牌之合同，受原料及燃煤之影響，未能如期交貨，幾經交涉，延至六月間始將各種車牌交齊，已逾本局規定之日期，現已分令各登記所趕緊掉換或登記，以期一車一牌之原則，早日實現。至第二步之整理車輛，現正辦理中，年來車商因物科價昂，因循不予修理，以致破舊不堪，爲觀瞻及維護安全計，自應切實整理，本局前以前座雙人三輪車因重心在前，轉灣不靈，容易發生意外，業已停止發給牌照營業，對於單人前座三輪車，亦擬於整理後，加以改善或淘汰，現正訂期檢騐中。至營業人力車，前第一區登記之九千一百餘輛，憶漸次檢騐完畢，進而檢騐舊市區所登記人力車，此後當不致再有破敗車輛行駛於途。第三步整理全市交通標誌，擬俟各項整理完畢後，即予着手辦理。○改善現況，本局對於各車輛登記所辦理登記車輛人員，會一再嚴令服務務求簡速化，對於額外需索，尤在禁止之列，數月來因額外需索而被查獲撤職者計有二十餘人，是以各車輛登記所主任，時有更動，如三輪車夫駕駛執照，駕駛人往往因不明手續之繁，以爲辦理人員故意延挨，至有賄賂情事，被本局查明後，職員固然撤職，而駕駛人亦取銷考騐資格，以示儆懲。</p>
<h3>法商電車加價問題</h3>
<p>最後順便報告最近法商電車加價事，法商電車公司之電車，槪由法商電力公司供給，該電力公司對電力收費未增收之前，電車公司似無增價之必要，此次該電車公司未呈准增價前，擅自增加車資，殊屬不合，本局已予禁止，並責令恢復原價，而該公司負責人，會來本局請求，謂前一區方面電車公司電力公司，雖未加價，而該電車公司亦擅自加價，且法商電車公司所用油煤等物，均無配給，全購自黑市，成本增漲，遂不得不略加車資，本局答以須調查該公司實際情形後方准予加價，並須定一較爲合理標準，不得任意招高價格，現此事仍在商討中，日內即可將結果公布]。</p>

<h3>華北經濟生活的支配者——合作社</h3>
<p>— 武公</p>
<p>華北是被目爲大東亞戰爭的兵站基地，所以關於物資的統制是愈顯其重要。在這個意義上，今日支配華北經濟生活的制度，較諸中國其它各地是有顯著的不同。所謂這裹的決戰體制，乃在軍政會社一體合作之中，作精進的推行的。軍與政是我們一目了然的，但會與社是什麼呢？會就是指新民會，社就是指合作社。這四個機關在一體合作之下，對於決戰施政的強化確有相當的成功。　　含有兩種特徵　　新民會是相同於過去的黨部，是地方上一種督察與民運的機關，但是這裹的合作社卻與南方的完全不同。今日華北的合作社不但具有合作社共同的性格，同時在其發生動機上卻又負有國策機關的任務，所以乃含有一種國家機關的性質，且基此特性充分地得發揮其產業經濟團體的機能，而與各關係各機關保持有機的連絡。其最大的理想，乃在於使華北漫無統制的經濟加以糾正，藉此變成有組織的經濟，根據全體利益，以公益爲前提，企求達成經濟與倫理的合一。故今日華北的合作社有兩種特徵：第一，把合作社作爲統制經濟的道路；第二，把國家本身設施由合作社來代行。對於前者不外指價格統制，收買與配給統制，生產統制等重要事項；而後者更是指合作社代行國家事業，是以國家也担負合作社所需用的一切經費。以目前情況而論，華北合作社的事業，可以包括信用，購買，販賣與利用四項，且如以農民爲對象，即不分孰經孰重，四者皆有聯帶關係。舉例來說，譬如指導督勵其春耕的時節，由合作社通融資金，對農民配給物資，然後由合作社收買其農產品，此可謂信用與購買事業之經營。隨此二種事業之後，更由合作社促進農業增產，使其生產物趨向集散於合作社，同時按其必要施以加工，此即爲販賣與利用之事業。這樣，讀者可以明瞭今日華北合作社對其民生經濟重要的一斑了。　　合作事業總會的產生　　華北的合作社在民國三十年十二月十六日結成大聯合，從那時起，就產生了華北合作事業總會。其特別會員有二，即華北政務委員會與中國聯合準備銀行是。兩者各出資二百二十五萬元，此外五十萬元則由五省市各別以普通會員資格擔任，計河北爲十萬五千元，山東爲三萬五千五百元，山西爲七萬六千八百五十元，河南爲二萬四千四百元，淮海省爲五千元，青島爲二千五百元，以及各縣擔任之總數爲二十五萬七百五十元。聞今日以淮海建省之故，有將合作社權益讓歸國府處理之說。是以總計華北合作事業總會之資金共有聯銀五百萬元，分爲十萬股，每股五十元，各會員於創立時各繳半數，後於民國三十二年六月十日完全繳足。當初成立之時，本由中日兩系職員所共同辦事，是以理事長爲中籍之王蔭泰，副會長即由日籍之山根譓擔任，此外常務理事，理事，監事，及各局科長等，莫不以中日兩系分任。及民國三十二年三月三十一日革退日系理監事之後，所有總會及各省縣合作社之日系職員乃悉數歸併於顧問室。今日任理事長者爲湯薌銘氏，副理事長暫缺。常務理事爲雷壽榮與張志遠二人，理事爲王永宗陳錦文萬兆芝周道會李鵬翔等八人，監事爲金少偉王守善等二人，在理事會之下，直辖人事與監查工室。此外分局辦事者，計有總務·指導·金融·事業與增產等五局。局之下爲各科，至於省縣合作事業聯合會，則也有理監事會，惟省聯設總務·指導·金融·事業與生產指導等五科，而縣聯則僅有庶務·指導·金融·事業與生產指導等五條，係設係主任一人。　　農耕貸金爲主要任務　　該會業務的進行，其重要者即在於農耕貸金，農產收買與增產實施。因爲華北合作事業總會，旣握有華北物資統制之大權，又有華北惟一之農業經營機關，故際此增產年頭，資金所需竟達一萬五千五百五十萬元之鉅。其中計春耕貸金爲一千二百萬元，鑿井資金四千萬元，水車資金五百萬元，　集葦蓆資金五百萬元，供給農業倉庫建設等固定設備之長期資金七百五十萬元，供運銷及收買農產品，同時購買農民必需物資以求分別配給等短期資金六千八百萬元，以及農農小額貸款資金一千八百萬元。至於收買工作，以小麥爲主，其它農產品如棉花，雜糧，大麥以及副農業生產呂如葦蓆，土布等亦經分別代爲斡旋。計三十一年度該總會爲各省縣聯斡旋者總值聯銀一萬萬七千九百九十二萬八千餘元。在增產方面，該總會會依照華北食糧增產計劃在河北省良鄉曁山東省歷城滋陽等三縣分別設立粟採種圃，以華北農事試騐塲育成之優秀粟種華農一號二號爲原種，計在民國三十一年度會收獲種子計一八○五七三市斤。去年即將該項種子，參酌其性質分別選定重點縣十五縣，播種一○四一五○官畝。同時爲謀增產工作益臻圖滑起見，復增設採種圃八處，其播種面積共討二○三○○官畝。　　組織運營的八大原則　　最後，我們且再一談華北合作社組織運營的八大原則。所謂八大原則，第一種視合作教育，第二財政獨立自營，第三全戶加入，使合作社全面普及華北各地，第四不分公積金，第五交易額採取比例的攤還原則，第六配給價格採取市價主義，第七限制出資金之利息，第八結成合作社的總力。這樣看起來，以國策機關的形態而產生了這樣的道德或經濟的團體，於完成大東亞建設基地（華北）的使命上確有極大的貢獻。本來這八大原則，原是前該會副理事長山根謾所確定，今已成爲華北合作事業總會的會務進行基策了。自從山根副理事長辭職後，現在的顧問一職即由千阪高興担任。預料今後以該總會人事的一新，其前途的發展當益有可觀。</p>

<h3>菲島台灣的鐵壁防衛態勢</h3>
<p>英美對日反攻作戰益形激烈，尼米資的中太平洋突破作戰與大陸天空的席諸特攻勢，也更加活潑，以巴時海峽爲中心，菲島台灣於是成爲其劍鋒所指的焦點，處於大東亞戰域的中央。美作戰本部顯然已將台灣菲島作爲其作戰指標之一。菲島台灣所負的重責，便是斷然粉碎其野心，通繫日本本部和中國大陸及南方共榮圈。爲了防備急求短期決戰之敵的侵攻，菲島台灣現已全島武裝起來，成爲大東亞的城砦，確立擊破驕敵的防衛態勢。下面是關於菲島台灣近況的現地報告。</p>
<h3>菲島</h3>
<p>過去，羅斯福會揚言未來的太平洋作戰便是尼米資從馬里亞納襲呂宋島，以及麥克活塞軍的進攻民大峨島。對於這個不遜巳極的挑戰，菲島的答覆就是將一切化爲戰力，決意擊潰　美。洛勒爾大總統爲求決戰勢態之完備，近已頒布菲島警察判罪法，厲行肅正菲島警察的綱紀，下令凡對兵器及其他軍需呂作虛僞報告者，處以十二年以下的徵投，喪失武器彈藥者則處死刑。決戰階段中的菲島情況，由此可見一斑。</p>
<h3>日僑的奮起</h3>
<p>再則，居留馬尼刺的日僑，也已決心全體武裝起來。過去，日僑早有鄰組的組織以圖配給等日常生活的簡易化及便於統制，並從事建設防空壕，及求食糧之自給自足等，近已收到相當效果。但今日這種消極的守勢的戰力化，已不能滿足，所以在每一職域成立職域報國會，速日抽出十分之一的人員從事軍隊的作業及建設，流汗健門。在鄉軍人之未教育者，亦已完成基本訓練，進而學習劈刺術，在[衝][殺]聲中，拚命猛烈訓練。這樣，在[敵人如果來]已變成[敵人必定來]的今日，日本僑民已團結一致，必滅驕敵的意，直沖斗牛。八月三日，在鄉軍人中部呂宋分會長兼警防團長會發出指令：[應儘速成立[戰友組]。[不論鄰組或警防團，悉已敵前配置化。在非常的時候，非常的對策是必要的。戰友組就是非常的對策。此即鄰組精神及行動之戰門化，使其組員化爲戰友。　　[敵機哪，不要到東京去，要來就到馬尼刺來罷！]這是當地日人眞誠無僞的希望。此即所謂吸敵擊敵的意氣。　　又，關於居留馬尼刺日僑的蹶起，鹽谷總領事會說：[關於在留邦人的組織臨戰化，今春以來正銳意努力研究中，現已實行改組日本人會，並以警防團爲中心，武裝在留日本人。我們已徹底覺悟常在戰塲之意。今日，決戰勢態化可視爲巳臻完善之境。]</p>
<h3>台灣</h3>
<p>在敵美打算突破中太平洋而打通往中國去的路綫的侵攻作戰之下，台灣也由從來的補給兵站基地漸漸暴露在第一綫上了。號稱[不沉航空母艦]的台灣，正負着粉碎敵美這個野心的重任。爲次期決戰塲而臨重大關頭的台灣，早就先於日本本部而斷然實行敵前總改變，強化防衛力，整備戰塲產業經濟勢態，確立即應作戰的一元化戰塲行政，全島武裝而起。此即爲期台灣本身防衛的完璧，充分完遂台灣所負戰略的使命起見。業已設立防衛本部及經濟動員本部，至其具體施策，則爲：　　一，充實警備力，徹底防空。　　二，技術·勞務及設備·資材之戰塲的轉換。　　三，增強戰塲必需物資之自給力，維持經濟秩序。　　四，全島民之戰塲的組織。　　五，確立戰塲行政勢態。</p>
<h3>全島的要塞化</h3>
<p>以此五點爲中心而圖全島要塞化，集結全島所有物心雙方的總力，確立必勝不動的勢態。更由長谷川總督，安藤台灣軍司令官，福田高雄警備府司令長官等隨時會談——此可稱爲台灣的最高戰爭指導會議——即應今後的戰局，決定戰塲施策。呼應當局的指導與要求，全島民衆的決戰意慾求甚旺盛，根據戰塲勢態整備要綱，全島中堅的青壯年層巳打成一片。[義勇報國隊]亦已結成，作爲鄉土防衛的中核，挺身從事非常警備，並爲車需生產，食糧增產起見，從九月一日起，已實行徵用全島青年男女。　　再則，與全島要塞化同時，台灣自九月一日起亦施行徵兵制，因受高砂義勇隊那種可歌可泣的愛國行動之刺激，全島適齡者皆決心一死報國，在設於島上各地的青訓特別鍊成所受嚴格的訓練，以備將來的檢查。台灣由於實施注種光榮的徵兵制，全島已武裝完畢，軍官民渾然成爲一體，以備未來的戰爭，確立發揮[不沈航空母艦]之威力的鐵桶似的陣容。（譯自八月三十日讀賣報知）</p>
<h3>大陸決戰前途</h3>
<p>美國欲利用中國爲對日攻擊主要戰塲的傾向，日益激化。美國爲何不從太平洋方面用其自誇的龐大的海軍力，空軍力堂堂進攻日本，而要繞道從中國攻擊日本呢？這不必說，即因從太平洋攻擊日本是絕對不可能的。這點美軍首腦部自己亦會予以承認。自從所羅門海戰以來，迄至最近，西南太平洋的基地爭奪戰，美軍在地理上雖已稍有進展，但這是用兵員與物址的大量消耗購得的。如將兩者比較一下，誰能夠說美軍是成功的呢？而況太平洋大部主要據點至今猶在日軍掌握之中。若從地理與時間兩觀點看，不得不指出美軍的失敗。　　美國企圖犧牲中國　　這種戰略的失敗，結果，在美國內部，由於戰爭資源的缺乏，特別是橡膠的不足，生產出質量上均告激降，而人員的補充也非常困難，因而使民間的壓戰氣氛更加濃厚。所以美國爲了打開這個困　，除出利用中國以外，再無別法。這就是利用　國戰略的地理條件，犧牲中國的人力物力，夢　完成對日戰爭。因此之故，美國最怕的是重慶中途轉向。此在美國本身，即爲他們非欺哄籠　重慶不可的理由。所以他們無論如何困苦，仍　得不將物資送去。過去華萊斯的赴渝，以及最近威爾遜·赫萊等的來華，都是爲了這個緣故，這若認爲是商量美國援助物資等事宜，是不行的。　　渝美空軍的脆弱　　然則這樣以中國爲基地的對日攻擊是否如預定一樣進展呢？自從日軍在河南發動攻勢以來，旋即攻陷洛陽·長沙·衡陽·展開擊滅美軍麾下渝軍的作戰，現在已從北方突破廣西省境，桂林·柳州等皆在嚴重的威脅之下，而美機之對日空襲，雖會數次進擾北九州及滿洲地區，但每次被擊墜的飛機都佔來襲總數的二三成，尤其是八日的空襲鞍山，喪失更多，約達五成。世界航空史上有這樣的例嗎？這點足以證明渝美空軍的脆弱及日軍的強靱。　　美國作戰的失敗與侵略中國的野心之暴露，已使中國民衆懷疑美國的眞意。衡陽攻防戰中，方軍長以下之停止抗戰，即爲一例。　　渝美合作前途堪慮　　美國對日攻略如果絕對不可能，那末，與美國合作的重慶，其前途將是怎樣呢？今日的舉動果可報答道破[無日本即無中國]，指明祗有和日本合作才可爭取中國之自主獨立的總理在天之靈嗎？日本對於重慶的這種吳，以東亞之友的立塲，予以無限的同情。日軍在七月五日聲明：[渝軍若停止抗戰，即非我人之敵。]即爲一種表示。重應爲了自主獨立，應該向左向右，業已明明白白。日本的航空生產力已急速上昇，正在摩拳擦掌，等待時機一熟，即將重重打擊美軍，使其不能再起。日本的飛機主產額，巳躍居世界第二位。美國雖說是第一位，但大半須分派到歐洲去，所以在質量上都非日本的對手。行將來臨的決戰，將是宣揚日本眞威風於全世界的時機吧。（山本海軍報道班員自某某基地發）（吉譯）白茅</p>
<h3>九年忌</h3>
<p>— 明烟</p>
<p>九年了，父親！我總沒有忘懷過你底一切，我記得你的笑容也更記得你的悉眉；悉，是的，自從母親離開了我們，你就沒有一天展眉。在黯淡的燈光下，寂寥的星月夜，就祗有幾個失去慈母的孩子伴着你，你不但不能向孩子們傾訴你的悲哀，你還得抑制住淚水撫慰嚷着要媽的不懂事的孩子和失去愛女的老母親，可是，我們已聽得你在哀泣地低吟：　　[寂寞空房夕照微，淒涼寒月上孤幃，傷心最是疾兒女，猶自燈前望母歸。]　　[阿母愴懷不勝悲，何期爲汝淚雙垂，等常小別猶依　，況是黃泉永訣時！]　　永訣！父親，誰意想到五年之後的一天，你也和我們實踐了這可怕的[永訣]！　　在生之征程僅及開始的時候，你就被迫離開我們而去了！雖然你是多麼地不願和不忍。病榻上拱着一雙顫抖的手，指指繞床的孩子求醫生：　　[你救救我，我不能死！]雖然醫生竭力說不妨事，然而你對生是萬分留　了，同時又恐懼着死神的脅迫會使你離開這一羣丟不開手，放不下心的孩庭！你要求生，並非怕死，爲的你知道，這一個家序，頃刻就會破碎，分離，流散!祗要你透不過最後的一口氣！　　我憤怒！我畏懼！我不敢想到死是什麼一回事。我嫉惡[死]，因爲它奪去了我所愛的一切；天地間惟一的眞愛，在我匆匆的來時，已被它迅速的奪去，它的手照顧着我底一生，令我陷入孤獨，單調，在茫茫的暗路上作漠然的摸索。任我呼號，哀求，它竟無絲毫憐憫或同情！　　回憶像一根針似的刺，戳着我底心，—我想起九年前的今天來了；那是多可怕的一晚，春風吹得使人有點煩燥，在寶隆醫院三樓的呻吟着，一切全是那麼的靜，但是在靜中卻蟄伏着急燥。當我跨進病房時，我的心弦在開始顫震，我瞧見父親痛苦地平躺在床上，眼睛半開的微閉着。房中每個人都帶着緊張的焦態，望着父親，我設想着連續的幻影，我想到過去，想到現在，想到將來。想到父親健康地生活時的每一個可愛的動作，他底笑容是仁慈的，但是仁慈中卻夾着嚴肅，我希望他能平安地出院，恢復我們原有的快樂底生活。突然，我底幻念給一種外來的騷動所截斷了，我所聽見的是繼母驚恐的低呌，她以顫抖的口音輕呼着父親底名字，七叔帶着恐慌的面色望着父親的臉，我挨進了床，看見父親肺部在急促的起伏着，喉管在　動著濕滑的痰，面上漸漸地紅了，然而又慢慢地灰白下去。空氣中交換着靜的寒流，每一個人靜聽着另一個脈膊的跳動，父親的呼吸變得更粗更急促了，而我的心弦也隨之更激烈地震蕩起來，在這[生]與一死]的茍延底一剎那的空間裹，我在痛苦地體騐着：人生的結束眞太慘了！　　遠處一輛汽降濺着雨水成了尾聲消失在黑暗裹，載着的父親已經成了另外的一個物體，他巳不再屬於這世界的了：是世界摒棄了他還是他拋棄了世界？總之他是脫離了痛苦的[生]而轉入了[死]的靜地了。他卸下的責任就這樣分担在我們的身上，他開始永久的休息，已不再作任何人的牛馬了！　　九年，父親！你去的太遠！呌我們無從告訴你這九年我們怎樣在人海中漂泊，在淒風苦雨中度過，九年不能算短，可是也就這麼電閃般的溜去，我們都已由一個孩子踏上了成年，父親！假使你能再張開眼一看，你一定會驚異：你的孩子們已經高得多了！……</p>
<h3>畢業</h3>
<p>— 小驚</p>
<p>○畢業了，整整的九年，到今日才告了個段落，這是該慶幸的，落筆寫此文的目的也就是爲了紀念它，因爲我和學校從此告別了啊！　　○九年的歲月，悠久地過去，一切老師們的臉，同學們的臉，我見過的眞是太多，卻總是一樣的平凡和淡漠，一切教本，一切的教導，我也接觸得很多，也總是一樣的死板和枯澀，我沒有這感情去親近它們，因爲我們之間，似乎相隔着一條江水，而互爲彼岸地對立着，九年的功夫，江水把我們愈沖愈遠了，但這關係卻還存在，還聯合着，一直到今天而止。　　○九年中，我也會飽嚐過生命的甜與苦，但這甜與苦，也像是太淡，幾乎失去了味道，九年前我帶了[漠然無所知]的心進了學校，九年後帶了更是[漠然無知]的心出了學校，但是，當初的情緒是天眞的純潔的，而現在的卻感染了些世界的澹漠，和生命的頑唐的氣息。　　○我失望，厭倦，憎恨，在平庸的臉，死板的書和淡漠的人味中，把光陰浪費了！　　○但是，我要紀念它，和那些零亂的回憶，因爲間接的，我也發現了自已的力量，什麼是正義，什麼是邪說，而掙扎着衝破這個羅綱。　　○我願意忘掉過去的一切，像一塲春夢讓它自生而又自滅罷，生命太可貴了，我要利用它，在大時代中出一分力，不讓它浪費消沈而歸於毀滅，因此跨過了學校的生活，我重新又開始自己的長途跋涉開創自己的新天地了！　　○畢業了，我擺脫過去一切，一切無知的對生命的浪費。　　○畢業後，我武裝自已一切，一切對前程的開墾。　　○江水的彼岸，永別了！但是，學習是永不止息的！</p>
<h3>夜</h3>

<p>隔壁人家有劃破寂靜的嘩拉嘩拉的牌聲。電燈輝煌着人們該不會知道夜已深深。門外，起了賣餛飩底敲竹筒的聲音，我彷彿看見那支孤獨的路燈下的孤獨的黑影……</p>
<h3>影</h3>
<p>— 江水</p>
<p>在悄悄的陋巷裹，在靜靜的斗室裹，有你始終守在我底身旁，我不會感到寂寞。是黃昏，你悄然來到我知道當我熄了燈你，孤獨的朋友　！就會離我而去可是我等着等着，等你和明天一齊來到</p>

<p>秋天是音樂的季節。無論是[以虫鳴秋]也好，無論是[聲在樹間]也好，這都是自然的巧設，借着吟蟄寒螀，蟲斯絡緯，白楊青桐，蘆葦芭蕉，在月夜，在疏雨輕陶冶性情，　貼靈魂，消袪從盛夏深署裹遺留下來的重濁困怠的感覺。　　秋天是音樂的季節。　　然而我們使一反顧，所處的是都市，所見的是高樓大廈，二十世紀的建築。即使眼前有一片草地，幾棵街樹，棲止着一二秋蟲，然而那又多麼貧乏！嘆息着時代的苦悶，生活的窒息，人們從心底裹需要發洩，需要寄託，不能不於自然的音律以外，企求更高更大的安慰，這時候就自然而然的記起伯牙，記起裴洛兒，記起蕭邦，記起李史特；設想古昔風流，六代豪華，吳王宮裹的響　廊，台城路邊的臨春閣，妙舞翩　，急管繁絃中聽一曲婉轉，縱不顚倒也令人心醉！更設想蓬府郊外，幽僻的秋徑中緩緩地來了那個音樂的英雄彼多芬，他走近一家矮屋，夜風吹滅燭火，月光從窗中侵入，溶溶地照着那正在奏彈的肓女照，着鋼琴的鍵盤，清幽，潔白，閑靜，長髮蓬鬆的音樂家情不自禁地奏下了那卓絕千古的[月光曲]（Moonlight　Sonata）。　　秋天是音樂的季節。　　可是就別一方面說，在秋天裹我們也很容易想到春天，而且這名詞又往往是象徵的，有時候是人生的春天——童年；有時候是人類的春天——孩子。從人生的春天到人類的春天，也就是從自己的童年聯想到所有正在童年裹的孩子，油然起同情之感。如果說人生的意義不僅在[取得]，一面也在[給與]，那末對着那些天眞無邪，不能不因困窮的煎逼而輟止求學的孩子，誰都願意伸出援助的手來。這就是音樂會所以舉行，同時又在此時此地舉行的原因。　　以音樂助學，在秋天裹挽住春天了。　　（編者按：助學金中西音樂大會由聯華銀行申報新聞報主辦，以國樂研究會及國立音樂院兩團體爲主體，另請名音樂家名歌唱家參加，將於十月二，三，五，六日在鬧心大戲院公開演奏。）</p>

<h3>中俄排球對抗賽華隊陣容支配問題</h3>
<p>本屆男女排球聯賽，早已過去，記者會在本刋談及女子方面，較前確有進境。男子方面，則未見顯著之成績。逎者有俄僑體育會，鑒於歷屆參加本市排球聯賽，因不慣遠東規則，終致功虧一簣，尤有不甘，最近乃向中青體育部主任梁兆安君下挑戰書，經數度商議，華隊決組織中青隊與之對抗，採用美國制遠東制各三塲。地點亦中青三塲，俄體三塲三塲，以資平均，決定究屬誰強，則在此六塲大戰之中，我人當可鑒及男子排球水準之提高也必無疑義，誠本屆排球壇之盛事。　　按中青隊集華人強隊粵華白隊華影三隊之精銳，及乙組中出類拔萃永三之郭斗照頤中之張瑞，名單早見各報，無異爲中華隊代表，故此番對抗，顯然含有國際性競爭，當爲球迷所矚目也。　　查俄隊對於美國規則，確屬造詣極深，而於遠東規則，似見生疎。然旣有雄心同華隊挑戰，當有所準備，豈可輕易視之。記者觀乎來者不善，敢作中青隊陣容支配之我見，所謂知已知彼，始能百戰百勝也。</p>
<h3>遠東陣容可臻想當之境</h3>
<p>遠東規則即中青比賽之九人制。我中華健兒，素習於此，自然輕駕熟路，然此番名單中俱屬上　之材，支配或艱。在鄙意以爲頭排應用左陳學崇中譚永湛右李賓中。其理由三人俱能得分，巳佔先着，而三人俱有相當高度，鎖綱又屬有利。進而言之，潭過去會與學崇合作，本屆又與賓中合手，自能左右逢源，何懼不水到渠成哉？二排左用汪德元可無問題，用候若愚，蓋候守攻之全材，右方一人，頗費研究，源秉球是否能勝任右路，乃一問題。程世寗守則有餘，攻嫌不足，郭斗照經騐尚差，難當大任，在無可如何中，鄙意唯有看當時情形而用車輛術耳。三排則可用粵華原班人馬，須注意者，廣東人之三排打法，總有過前之缺點，似有歷史之襲性。如然，則三排不妨可起用一較爲靜止之他將，以補此不足，照如此陣容出迎，可稱理想，痛飲黃龍，勢所必然。</p>
<h3>美國規則支配須經縝密考慮</h3>
<p>美國規則用六人制，其一人發球後，地位均隨之更動。反輪至頭排時，始有劈擊機會，輪至二排時，僅有守而不能攻也。故此項陣容之調度，先應作對方上塲時之陣容如何，調動後之變更若何，然後作自己陣容與之對抗，始克事半功倍。俄將陣綫，我方尚未能有深切之認識，在如是情形之下，則我人顧用美國規則唯一之要素，即[一托一擊制]兩人更須有相當默契，當然此決非最上之策，目下亦不得不然耳。好在一局可以調人，當可視當時戰況而隨機應變也。至華隊此番能搭配者，記者心目中之三對爲○汪德元程世寗，二人久隸一隊，且每屆西青必加入，經騐已具，當能勝任。○麥炳堯譚永湛，麥之一托，譚之快叩，球迷無不知之，所擔心者譚是否習於綱較高之叩殺，想譚之經騐老到，出奇制勝，可新我耳目。○陳學崇與侯若愚或張瑞，侯能力經騐固較張爲上，然事實上美國制時以張之步步留神，可以超出侯之上。況張對於美國制，過去作戰甚多，故當捨侯而用張也。觀上述六人，每人皆有托擊叩之能力。是則臨陣能應付裕如，勝利固無把握，演出自必精彩。</p>
<h3>討論主要之點指導以爲何如</h3>
<p>上述鄙見中必成疑問者，當爲採用遠東規則時，當局對於頭排陣綫，大致用左陳學崇中譚永湛右麥炳堯，以麥托球之妙，理當任用。然麥習於居中，一旦調右，必難發展，若使其居中，而譚右之，則譚亦未必習此。而記者觀乎李寶中在右方而用左手扯叩，與陳學崇在左方用右手叩殺，遙遙相對，而中央有老譚之或托或叩，始能盡善盡美。質之指導戚公，以爲如何？緣戚公久居香島，主輯體育報，對於各項球類，均有卓見，尤以排球爲最有研究，記者之陋見，敬待指教焉？</p>
<h3>葡紅蟬聯錦標</h3>
<p>— 苗山</p>
<p>本年度全滬壘球聯賽，已於上週日圓滿結束。冠軍仍爲葡商紅（Lusitan　Ｒeds）所保持。該隊於去年亦與西青決賽獲得錦標。今年西青，倖勝華人勁旅熊貓而獲決賽權，奈枝不如人，臨陣失常，以二比六敗於葡紅。</p>
<h3>冠軍葡紅進攻力強</h3>
<p>此次西青敗戰，與熊貓敗於葡隊如出一轍。緣西青在第一局中被葡紅三人連續安打上壘，而成滿壘危局。此時恰逢胖子湯拔拉出擊，西青知此君之危險妙擊，故送其[自由一壘]，葡隊白得一分。但輪至福恩揮捧，此君如有神助，只見球沿一壘綫直穿外翼，在壘三人相繼歸壘。厥後Ｖ蘇若一擊又將福恩帶歸，西青此局連失致命之五分，實無可挽救。葡隊之能獲勝，實賴其進攻力之堅強，爲他隊所莫及也。</p>
<h3>西青諸將表演平庸</h3>
<p>西青球藝遠不及熊貓，惟因裁判偏袒此獲勝。該隊日籍植島及岩達君，均會留學美國，球藝優良。但在決賽中，植島表演大失常態，屢次漏球，故反不如熊貓之留日名手梁友聲之穩健。且西青之投手凱捷密洛夫亦不及熊貓之李啓騰，李君投球，急而有曲綫，姿勢美妙，其前程實無可限量。西青會昨用唯一制葡隊死命之短擊奪回二分，但其進攻力量仍覺太弱，而致無法扳回敗局。　　又今日（二十四日）上午十時及下星期日，將有二幕表演賽於膠州公園，乃混合戰冠軍。熊貓亦有四將被選，此亦爲本年壘球季結束前之精彩點綴也。</p>
<h3>珍聞</h3>
<p>本屆足球賽，參加甲組隊者，目下內中極可能有為化。據確籺，義軍及俄將均將有新姿態出現　　陳效平經一夏季之苦練，各方面有顯著進境，有試華通前鋒之可能。　　華影籃球隊隊長舒適，球事興趣甚濃，對於工作，更爲努力。最近其一手編導之新片，[苦兒天堂]，記者在試映時，得先諸後，認爲滿意，注重兒童教育，實新題材，阿舒誠不媿能者。　　滬上盟主華聯籃球隊馬華聯藥廠總經理張　祥所領導，隊員技術優良，宛如華聯廠之出品。最近消息，該廠爲增加生廠，微求技佐十名，高中程度，不論性別，實習三個月內，供膳宿有津貼。期滿薪給可增至五千元。求職業者可向桂林路三六五號該廠報名。吾人爲健康而練習運動，然職業更爲重要，特誌之以告讀者。　　鐵夫足籃球遠征蘇北軍，轉戰六縣，大小共十餘戰，戰無不克，攻無不勝，全隊已於昨日下午由陳中率領班師返滬。　　振源錢莊經理翁士熒熱心體育，組織振源足籃球等隊，成績斐然，翁君亦出任爲隊員，每賽應戰，從不誤卬，誠熱心人也。　　籃球名將馮念華陳祥龍二人息影已久，茲者在申報盃籃球聯賽中，二人決參加大華隊，念華之地板功夫，我人又可有美妙之演出欣賞。　　同仁隊蔣叔良已返滬，仍爲該隊效勞，則同仁隊之演出，又將刮目相視。（奮）</p>

<h3>Weekly Review: Decisive Battle in the Diet</h3>
<p>— Kan Kwong-chak</p>
<p>The 85th extraordinary session of the Japanese Diet convened on September 7th, lasting for five days. The proceedings have been reported in various newspapers. I believe that the participating Diet members and government officials, under a common central goal, discussed with sincerity how to strengthen the unity of the people's power, how to maximize the overall strength, and how to ensure a winning posture to achieve the final objective. This common central goal is that as the Greater East Asia War has entered its final decisive stage, it is necessary to use the greatest and highest power to strive for final victory. Therefore, we can call this Diet session the "Decisive Battle Diet." Secondly, this Diet session is the first since the formation of the Koiso Cabinet. From Prime Minister Koiso to each cabinet member, there is a shared feeling of being entrusted with a major situation, with heavy responsibilities. They naturally place more enthusiastic demands on this Diet to strengthen national unity and overall strength. At the same time, the Diet members also feel that the situation is becoming increasingly serious and are naturally more willing to contribute the greatest assistance to this Diet, which the government is enthusiastically requesting. Therefore, the holding of this Diet session, under the mutual enthusiasm of the government and the Diet members, must be filled with intense passion and sincere understanding, and earnest discussions. Its great achievements will not be accidental. In this Japanese Diet session, what is particularly impressive is, first, the Japanese government's emphasis on the power of the people at this decisive stage. Second, respect for public opinion. As a result, it has also gained unanimous support and cooperation in the Diet, enabling all its policies to be implemented. The [Mainichi Shimbun] of September 9th specifically pointed out that [the Koiso Cabinet's respect for the Diet and its eagerness to listen to its opinions can be said to surpass all previous cabinets]. On the government side, after considering the current situation and the surrounding circumstances, there is absolutely no psychology of evasion or avoidance towards the Diet and its opinions. This is precisely the performance that a healthy government should have. The government and the Diet can both abandon subjective ideas, rise together to protect the motherland, maintain the national spirit of three thousand years, and concentrate the power of the whole people to meet the future decisive victory with battle. The Koiso Cabinet's emphasis on public opinion is particularly concrete. The Prime Minister frankly declared in the Diet that the government [deeply trusts the loyalty of the people, communicates public opinion freely, and does not obscure the ears and eyes of the people]. This declaration further gave the Diet a good impression. Diet member Matsumura praised it as [following this great path, the foundation of governance lies herein]. Ando Masazumi further discussed [the way to free communication of opinions] in the Diet, pointing out that respecting public opinion and communicating the will of the people will spontaneously arouse the people's fighting spirit. He cited the ancient proverb: [A country has three misfortunes: having talented people in the countryside and not knowing them is one misfortune; knowing them and not using them is the second misfortune; using them and not entrusting them is the third misfortune]. Therefore, he called on the authorities to further improve public opinion countermeasures, respect public opinion, and trust the people, which was ultimately adopted by the government. Here, we admire Japan for having such loyal and outspoken civilian leaders, and even more admire Japan for having such humble authorities who listen to public opinion and sincerely respect it. From this, we can assert that only under such cooperation between the government and the people, where the people dare to speak out and the government accepts their advice, and only under the close cooperation between officials and civilians as demonstrated by this Decisive Battle Diet in Japan, can the national politics be on the right track and the national policies be thoroughly implemented. While discussing the success of this Decisive Battle Diet in Japan and being optimistic about the future of the East Asian war situation, we cannot but make more sincere expectations for all aspects of the Chinese government and people!</p>
<h3>President Laurel Proclaims War on the United States and Great Britain; The Entire Philippine Territory Divided into Nine Martial Law Zones</h3>
<p>Manila, 23rd (Central News Agency): Philippine President Laurel declared at his official residence at 10:00 AM on the 23rd that the Philippine Republic, from 10:00 AM on the 23rd, has entered a state of war with the United States and Great Britain. The text of his declaration of war is as follows: [Filipino people, during the period of foreign domination in the past, have continued to strive to gain freedom and independence. To achieve this goal, they have fought two wars and constantly launched revolutions. On October 14, 1943, the long-cherished freedom and independence of the Philippines was finally achieved. Afterwards, the President of the Philippine Republic broadly appealed to the world for friendship and peace, especially to the United States, requesting that no military action be taken in the Philippines, so that the calamity would not spread to the Philippine Islands. The United States and Great Britain, despite this request, still intruded into some areas of the Philippines from the air, infringing upon the territorial integrity of the Republic, killing and injuring the Philippine people, and destroying the property of the Philippine people. Now, the Philippine Republic has no choice but to rise up to defend its independence and territorial integrity. The Philippine Republic, in order to maintain its independence and territory, has concluded a treaty of mutual respect for sovereignty and territory with Japan. Therefore, today, the 23rd of September, 1944, at 10:00 AM, Philippine President Laurel has entered a state of war with the United States and Great Britain. At this critical moment of the war, I sincerely appeal to all citizens to support the government, fulfill their greatest national loyalty, and hope that our experience may suffer bitterness in the near future. However, we must, under consolidated unity, uphold the freedom and independence of the Philippines.] Manila, 23rd (Central News Agency): Philippine President Laurel, in order to defend the country and maintain public order, in accordance with the provisions of Article II, Section 2 of the Philippine Constitution, ordered that martial law be implemented throughout the country from 9:00 AM on September 22nd. At the same time as the implementation of martial law, the President immediately gained control of important political power, limiting the immediate division of the entire Philippine territory into nine martial law zones. Among them, seven zones appointed the local administrative chiefs as martial law commanders, and appointed mayors and county chiefs under their command as deputy local martial law commanders. The other two zones were the Mayor of Manila, who was appointed as the martial law commander of the eighth zone, and the Undersecretary of the Interior, who was appointed as the martial law commander of the ninth zone. Each martial law commander may, in accordance with the criminal law, suppress those who rebel, mutiny, or riot within their zone, in order to maintain general peace.</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Intercept Enemy Fleet in Philippine Waters; Manila Again Attacked by Enemy Aircraft</h3>
<p>A certain Japanese base in the southwestern Pacific, 23rd (Central News Agency): A Japanese aircraft squadron discovered the Philippines on the morning of the 22nd and immediately attacked it, inflicting heavy damage. It also strafed several enemy large aircraft carriers with machine guns, causing their flight decks to catch fire. Manila, 23rd (Central News Agency): Enemy carrier-based aircraft again launched a large-scale attack on the Manila area on the 22nd. From 7:30 AM to 10:00 AM, a total of 200 aircraft bombed port facilities and airfields in four waves. Some enemy aircraft strafed the city, and dropped bombs on the area near the Bilibid Church and the Japanese Embassy. As a result, the Bilibid Church was ultimately destroyed, and the residences of Filipino civilians and overseas Chinese in the vicinity of the church were also heavily bombed. The damage to the Japanese Embassy was very minor. According to subsequent investigations, the enemy aircraft that attacked on the 22nd suffered a total of 19 aircraft shot down or destroyed, including 15 shot down by ground fire, 2 destroyed, and 2 shot down in aerial combat. Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency): An enemy large-scale mobile unit in the Mariana and West Caroline Seas appeared east of the Philippines on the 21st. At the same time, 500 enemy carrier-based aircraft attacked the areas around Manila twice, in the morning and afternoon of that day. As a result, 30 were shot down by the Japanese side, and 6 were destroyed, totaling 36. The enemy aircraft's attack on Manila was an attempt to alienate the feelings between the Japanese military and the Filipino people, and to disrupt public morale. This time, the enemy aircraft's bombing was indiscriminate, so the Japanese side's losses on the ground and on ships were very minor.</p>
<h3>Air Raids on Nauru and Wotje Islands</h3>

<h3>Chinese and Japanese Governments Declare Cooperation in Philippine War</h3>
<p>Chinese Government Statement Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency): The Philippine Republic resolutely rose up to defend its country and maintain its independence and declared war on the United States and Great Britain. The National Government issued a statement, expressing its intention to cooperate with the Philippines in completing the war. The original text is as follows: The Philippine Republic government, recently due to the enemy's US indiscriminate bombing, the situation is becoming more and more serious, in order to protect the territory and maintain public order, especially on the 22nd of this month, issued a national martial law order, and on the next day issued a declaration of war statement, and the Greater East Asia countries and nationalities to support each other, hope to give cooperation, and move towards the path of destroying the United States and Great Britain. The National Government, upon learning of this, was deeply pleased. Our Greater East Asia War has added a new force. The final victory will belong to us, which can be predicted. The Philippines was originally a member of Greater East Asia. In the past, it was unable to extricate itself due to the enemy's US aggression and oppression. Fortunately, the allied nation Japan launched the Greater East Asia War, and was able to get rid of the shackles of the United States and Great Britain and obtain liberation. It then announced its independence on October 14 of last year, and established a republican government. Our National Government immediately gave formal recognition. President Laurel, after the war, on the one hand, maintained good faith with Japan, and on the other hand, devoted himself to the reorganization of internal affairs, in order to complete the long-cherished wish of independence. This time, in order to defend the motherland, uphold independence, resolutely participate in the war, and stand on the front line with the belief of sure victory, the nature of the Greater East Asia War is becoming more and more clear and powerful. The National Government of China, in this regard, is determined to cooperate fully in the spirit of past friendship, jointly destroy the United States and Great Britain, and realize world justice and permanent peace as soon as possible. This statement is especially made.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency): After the Philippine Republic declared war on the United States and Great Britain, the Japanese government issued a statement at 1:15 PM on the 23rd through the Information Bureau, as follows: The Philippine government has already declared war on the United States and Great Britain on September 23rd. At this time, the Greater East Asia war situation is becoming more and more urgent, and entering the decisive battle. Eighteen million Filipino citizens, in order to defend the country and uphold the independence of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, have resolutely risen up to declare war. The reasons for this have been fully stated in the Philippine government's declaration of war. Japan sympathizes with this. Since gaining glorious independence last autumn, the Philippines has been personally led by President Laurel, internally striving to prepare internal affairs, and externally seeking close cooperation with Japan and friendly countries in the Greater East Asia Sphere. This time, it has resolutely stood on the front line of destroying the United States and Great Britain, and is uniting with all the countries and nationalities of Greater East Asia to fight for the liberation of East Asia. This is a great event in history, and the revival of East Asia can be expected. The Japanese Empire sincerely hopes to maintain the honored independence of the Philippines and to complete the defense of the Philippine territory. From now on, it will strengthen its cooperation with the country, and based on the Japan-Philippines alliance treaty, will spare no effort to provide the greatest assistance to the Philippines. Further, it will cooperate in completing the war, destroy the United States and Great Britain, and realize the goal of building Greater East Asia. To this end, the Japanese government expresses its beliefs internally and externally.</p>
<h3>Extremely Significant</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency): After the news that the Philippine Republic had declared war on the United States and Great Britain spread, all of China, from top to bottom, felt honored. The highest authorities of the National Government and the Japanese government have both issued statements, expressing full cooperation with the Philippines to complete the war. The Philippines only achieved its long-cherished wish of independence in October of last year, with the enthusiastic assistance of Japan. The enemy, the United States, is attempting to actively counterattack and realize its ambition to invade East Asia. Therefore, it is the urgent and incumbent duty of the East Asian countries to rise up to defend East Asia and strike at the United States and Great Britain. Our country and Thailand have also successively joined the war. Burma declared war on the United States and Great Britain in August of last year, and India has also launched an attack against the enemy entrenched in the motherland. Now that the Philippines is directly participating in the battle to destroy the United States and Great Britain, all the countries and nationalities of Greater East Asia are rising up to complete the decisive system of the total advance of one billion East Asians. We must issue a solemn warning to the Chongqing side, which has not awakened from its dream of relying on the United States and Great Britain, and should deeply reflect, resolutely break free from the shackles of the United States and Great Britain, and cooperate with all East Asians to expel the forces of the United States and Great Britain in East Asia. We should, under the leadership of the highest authorities of the National Government, highly cooperate in the war and achieve permanent peace in East Asia.</p>
<h3>Comments Released Yesterday by Japanese Military Commander in the Philippines</h3>
<p>Manila, 23rd (Central News Agency): The supreme commanders of the Japanese Army and Navy stationed in the Philippines released their views on the 23rd as follows: The significance of the Philippine Republic's declaration of war on the United States and Great Britain today and its immediate entry into a state of war lies in destroying the ambition of the United States and Great Britain to invade East Asia, liberating the East Asian nations, and maintaining the permanent peace of East Asia. Since the independence of the Philippines in October last year, based on the Japan-Philippines alliance treaty, and in accordance with the spirit of common defense, it has contributed to the war. The violent and unreasonable United States and Great Britain dream of subordinating the Philippines again, using it as a base for invading East Asia, and even killing its people and damaging its dwellings. Therefore, the Philippine government and the entire nation have risen up together to respond to this challenge and declare that they have entered a state of war with this common enemy of East Asia. The Japanese army now intends to protect the independent government of the Philippines with an iron wall, and is fully prepared and ready to destroy everything of the enemy without mercy. The final victory will belong to those who trust the military prowess of the Japanese army, give full cooperation, and rouse the indomitable fighting spirit to defeat the violent enemy, in order to complete the great task of establishing peace in East Asia.</p>
<h3>The Imperial Headquarters Announced Yesterday that Japanese Forces Occupied Wuzhou and Elite Troops Have Already Invaded Southern Areas</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:20 PM on the 23rd: Since the beginning of September, Japanese forces in the Southern China region have engaged in battles on both sides of the West River and launched attacks on the Seventh War Area of Chongqing from the Leizhou Peninsula. On September 22nd, they occupied Wuzhou.</p>
<p>Southern China Front, 23rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - Japanese forces advancing westward from the south bank of the West River occupied Southern Areas (approximately 25 kilometers southwest of Deqing) on the morning of the 22nd. Another powerful Japanese force has occupied Liantan (20 kilometers south of Deqing), it is reported.</p>
<p>Japanese Forces Forward Base, 23rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - After occupying the base of the 58th Division of the Chongqing Army in Yunfu on the night of the 19th, a powerful Japanese force advanced fiercely westward along the south bank of the West River. At 17:00 on the 20th, they reached Fodong (15 kilometers west of Yunfu), overcame the natural barrier of Dayun Mountain, and continued to advance, making a surprise attack on the Luoding River at the foot of the mountain. After successfully crossing the river, at 20:00 on the afternoon of the 20th, they broke into Liantan (20 kilometers south of Deqing). Furthermore, according to aerial reconnaissance, another powerful Japanese force on the ground had invaded Southern Areas by 7:30 AM on the 22nd. Therefore, the base of the 35th Army Group of the Chongqing Army in Deqing and the area on the opposite bank are now completely threatened by Japanese forces, it is said.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Confirms the Fall of Wuzhou</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a report from an Associated Press correspondent in Chongqing on the 22nd, the situation in the Guangdong and Guangxi provinces is as follows: A spokesperson for the Chongqing Military Affairs Commission admitted on the 22nd that Japanese forces had occupied Wuzhou on the right bank of the West River, and that Japanese forces are now continuing to advance westward, which can be seen as the beginning of an offensive towards Liuzhou. In addition, a separate Japanese force has launched an offensive northeastward from the Leizhou Peninsula, penetrating into Guangxi Province and occupying Rong County (95 kilometers southwest of Wuzhou). According to informed sources, if the gap between Wuzhou and Rong County is closed, the Japanese forces can secure an arc-shaped line of defense from Hainan Island through Wuzhou to Hong Kong. In this way, Guangdong will become a major offensive and defensive area for Japanese forces against American forces landing on the Chinese coast.</p>

<h3>Director Ye Reports on Municipal Public Utilities Administration, Press Conference Held Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Municipal Propaganda Department held its twentieth press conference yesterday. More than ten reporters from various newspapers and news agencies attended. Director Liang presided over the meeting, and Director Ye of the Public Utilities Bureau and Section Chief Lai were invited to answer questions from reporters regarding municipal public utilities administration. Director Ye first reported on the past and recent work of the Public Utilities Bureau, stating as follows:</p>
<h3>Handover and Management of Vehicle Affairs</h3>
<p>First, the Bureau was ordered to uniformly manage all municipal public utilities administration in February of this year. The first matters taken over were land transportation matters. Other matters, such as docks and advertising, were also initially started in the old eight districts, and were gradually taken over. Later, after the merger of the one and eight districts, the Bureau's affairs also progressed daily, and the unification work was completed. Among them, land transportation matters were the most complex, as described below: ○ Handover of vehicle affairs handled by the Police Bureau, and the establishment and changes of the Central District Office. On February 16th of this year, after the Bureau was ordered to take over the vehicle affairs handled by the former First Police Bureau, it immediately established the Central District Office on Madang Road, with three sections to handle general affairs, water and electricity, and vehicle matters. The former registration stations of the one and eight districts on Gongping Road, Jiangning Road (i.e., Gordon Road), and Changxing Road (i.e., Loujiawan) were changed to vehicle registration offices, and more than ninety vehicle handling personnel from part of the First Police Bureau were temporarily borrowed to gain experience. Later, after the unification of the city on August 1st, the Bureau abolished the Central District Office and established a vehicle registration office there, specializing in the registration of self-owned rickshaws and tricycles, which, together with the above three registration offices, were all under the direct management of the section. All borrowed personnel from the Police Bureau had been transferred back to the First Police Bureau in batches before the end of June, and the Bureau appointed directors and deputy directors to be responsible for handling them].</p>
<h3>Unifying Licenses and Reorganizing Axles</h3>
<p>○ Guiding principles for handling: When the Bureau took over on February 16th, it formulated three guiding principles: first, to reorganize and unify vehicle licenses throughout the city, with a planned period of three months from February to May; second, to reorganize various vehicles, with a period of six months from May to November; and third, to reorganize traffic signs throughout the city, with a period of three months from November to January of the 34th year. However, in the first step of unification after the Bureau took over, the contract between the former First District Finance Office and the Guangda Iron Factory for the production of magnetic license plates was affected by raw materials and coal, and the delivery could not be made on schedule. After several negotiations, the various license plates were not delivered until June, which was beyond the date specified by the Bureau. The Bureau has now ordered the registration offices to expedite the replacement or registration in order to realize the principle of one vehicle, one license as soon as possible. The second step of reorganizing vehicles is currently underway. In recent years, vehicle dealers have been delaying repairs due to high material costs, resulting in dilapidated conditions. For the sake of appearance and safety, it is necessary to carry out thorough reorganization. The Bureau previously stopped issuing licenses for front-seat double tricycles because the center of gravity was in the front, the turning was not flexible, and accidents could easily occur. For single-person front-seat tricycles, it is also planned to improve or eliminate them after reorganization, and a date for inspection is currently being set. As for business rickshaws, more than 9,100 vehicles registered in the former First District have gradually been inspected. Next, the registered rickshaws in the old urban area will be inspected. After this, there should no longer be dilapidated vehicles running on the road. The third step of reorganizing traffic signs throughout the city is planned to be carried out after the various reorganizations are completed. ○ Improving the current situation: The Bureau has repeatedly ordered the personnel in the vehicle registration offices to simplify and speed up the handling of vehicle registration, and extra solicitations are especially prohibited. In the past few months, more than twenty people have been investigated and dismissed for extra solicitations. Therefore, the directors of the vehicle registration offices have often been changed. For example, rickshaw drivers often do not understand the complexity of the procedures for driver's licenses and believe that the handling personnel are deliberately delaying them, which leads to bribery. After the Bureau found out, the officials were dismissed, and the drivers were also disqualified from examinations to serve as a warning.</p>
<h3>Price Increase Issue of French Tram</h3>
<p>Finally, I would like to report on the recent price increase of French trams. The trams of the French Tram Company are supplied by the French Electric Power Company. Before the Electric Power Company increases the electricity fee, it seems that there is no need for the Tram Company to increase the price. This time, the Tram Company increased the fares without prior approval, which is inappropriate. The Bureau has prohibited it and ordered it to restore the original price. However, the person in charge of the company came to the Bureau to request, saying that the Tram Company and the Electric Power Company in the former First District had not increased the price, but the Tram Company had also increased the price without authorization, and the oil and coal used by the French Tram Company were not allocated, but were all purchased from the black market, which increased the cost. Therefore, it was necessary to slightly increase the fares. The Bureau replied that it would allow the price increase after investigating the actual situation of the company, and a more reasonable standard must be set, and the price must not be arbitrarily increased. This matter is still under discussion, and the results will be announced in the next few days].</p>
<h3>Tricycle Prices Being Negotiated</h3>
<p>Then, Director Ye answered the questions from the reporters as follows: ○ National News asked: What is the working policy of the Municipal Transportation Improvement Committee? (Answer) It was decided at a meeting the day before yesterday that the name of the committee would be slightly changed to the Transportation Promotion Committee. The work of the committee is advisory in nature. The members provide opinions at any time during the meeting. After the resolution, it is sent to the municipal government for approval and handed over to the relevant authorities for handling. ○ Central News Agency Shanghai Branch asked: It is hoped that there will be a standard price for tricycles in the city. (Answer) The price of tricycles in the city was previously stipulated, but due to rising prices, the previously stipulated price is no longer applicable. The new price standard is being submitted for approval. However, before approval, prices have risen again. Therefore, at 3:00 PM today, the Bureau will convene the persons in charge of various tricycle companies to discuss a proper solution as a standard for marking prices in the future. ○ Shen Bao and Central News Agency Shanghai Branch asked: The price regulations for tricycles should be based on the rise and fall of general prices and approved by the competent authority, because the time for submission to the municipal government for approval is too long, and general prices fluctuate again, which affects the regulated price. (Answer) In the past, the Public Utilities Bureau was responsible for stipulating and then submitting it to the municipal government for approval, but because the official documents submitted by the Bureau to the government took a long time to return, a proper solution is being discussed. ○ China Daily asked: Can the water and electricity consumption in the city be further adjusted? (Answer) According to the company authorities, whether the water and electricity consumption can be adjusted depends on the amount of coal available. If coal can be continuously transported to Shanghai, then it can be considered to increase the consumption. ○ New China Daily asked: It is said that the Shanghai Tram Company will increase prices next month. What is the authorities' position on this? (Answer) It is said that the Ministry of Construction has not yet approved it.</p>
<h3>Comprehensive Rationing Certificates Issued in Nanshi</h3>
<p>Regarding the implementation of the comprehensive rationing certificate system in the entire Nanshi area, the Municipal Goods Rationing Office yesterday issued a formal announcement, stating: From the 30th of this month to the 18th of October, comprehensive rationing certificates numbered 16 to 30 will be issued. All residents in the area should immediately have the head of each household bring the rationing certificate, the household head's residence certificate, and the yellow household registration form, and go directly to the Nanshi Issuing Office of the Goods Rationing Office (at the original site of the former Grain Bureau) to collect the rationing certificates for all residents living in the household on the collection date indicated on the previous rationing certificate. It is also reported that the Goods Rationing Office has established three sub-issuing offices in the entire area of Nanshi to facilitate the issuance of certificates to citizens of Nanshi: the 17th sub-issuing office is located in the former Grain Bureau on Penglai Road, the 18th sub-issuing office is located in the Yimiao Inner Picture, and the 19th sub-issuing office is located on Nanzhan Road.</p>
<h3>Juvenile Protection Section Implements Reformatory Education for Juvenile Offenders, Agreement Reached with the District Procuratorate, Implementation Begins Today</h3>
<p>The Juvenile Protection Section of the Longyi District, which originally belonged to the Industrial Investigation Office, was merged into the Health Bureau after the district government was abolished. Its usual work is to handle matters such as lost, deceived, and abandoned children, as well as the management and education of general child laborers. It has achieved great success in the past. Recently, the Bureau, in view of the increasing number of juvenile offenders in the city, in order to reduce recidivism and enable those who have committed crimes to start anew, has consulted with the Shanghai Procuratorate. In the future, for juvenile offenders under the age of sixteen, after judgment, the Bureau's Juvenile Protection Section will be informed together with the judgment, and personnel will be sent to the detention center to conduct individual investigations. When necessary, they may also be taken out and placed in orphanages, or sent back to their families, assisted by the Bureau's social workers, to provide individual reformatory education, so that generally young and ignorant juvenile offenders may know how to correct their mistakes and start anew. This work has been coordinated with the District Procuratorate and will be implemented immediately.</p>
<h3>Municipal Education Funds to be Released Starting Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The teachers and staff of the schools in the city are eagerly hoping to receive their September education funds in advance because the Mid-Autumn Festival is approaching.

<h3>The Dominator of Economic Life in North China - Cooperative Societies</h3>
<p>— Wu Gong</p>
<p>North China is regarded as the supply base for the Greater East Asia War, so the control of materials is becoming increasingly important. In this sense, the system that dominates economic life in North China today is significantly different from other parts of China. The so-called decisive battle system here is being promoted vigorously through the unified cooperation of the military, government, companies, and societies. The military and government are clear to us, but what are companies and societies? Companies refer to the New People's Society, and societies refer to cooperative societies. Under the unified cooperation of these four organizations, there has been considerable success in strengthening the implementation of policies for the decisive battle. Has Two Characteristics</p>
<p>The New People's Society is similar to the party departments of the past, and is an organization for supervision and civil movement in the local area, but the cooperative societies here are completely different from those in the south. Today, cooperative societies in North China not only have the common characteristics of cooperative societies, but also bear the task of national policy organs in their motives for establishment. Therefore, they contain the nature of a state organ, and based on this characteristic, they fully develop the functions of an industrial economic organization and maintain organic contact with various related organizations. Their greatest ideal is to correct the unorganized economy of North China, thereby transforming it into an organized economy, based on the overall interests, taking public welfare as the premise, and striving to achieve the unity of economy and ethics. Therefore, today's cooperative societies in North China have two characteristics: first, using cooperative societies as a means to control the economy; second, having the state itself delegate facilities to cooperative societies for implementation. The former mainly refers to important matters such as price control, procurement and distribution control, and production control; while the latter refers to cooperative societies acting on behalf of state undertakings, so the state also bears all the expenses required by the cooperative societies. In the current situation, the undertakings of cooperative societies in North China can include credit, purchasing, sales, and utilization, and if farmers are the target, the four are all related, regardless of which is more or less important. For example, during the spring plowing season, the cooperative society provides funding, distributes materials to farmers, and then the cooperative society purchases their agricultural products. This can be said to be the operation of credit and purchasing undertakings. Following these two undertakings, the cooperative society promotes increased agricultural production, so that its products tend to be concentrated and distributed in the cooperative society, and processing is carried out as necessary. This is the sales and utilization undertaking. In this way, readers can understand a glimpse of the importance of today's cooperative societies in North China to their people's economic life. The Emergence of the General Federation of Cooperative Enterprises</p>
<p>Cooperative societies in North China formed a grand union on December 16th, 1941. From that time on, the General Federation of Cooperative Enterprises of North China was established. There were two special members, namely the North China Political Affairs Committee and the United Reserve Bank of China. Each contributed 2.25 million yuan. In addition, 500,000 yuan was borne by five provinces and cities in separate ordinary member qualifications, namely Hebei with 105,000 yuan, Shandong with 35,500 yuan, Shanxi with 76,850 yuan, Henan with 24,400 yuan, Huaihai Province with 5,000 yuan, Qingdao with 2,500 yuan, and the total amount borne by the counties was 250,750 yuan. It is said that due to the establishment of Huaihai Province, there is a saying that the rights and interests of the cooperative society will be transferred to the national government for disposal. Therefore, the total funds of the General Federation of Cooperative Enterprises of North China are 5 million yuan from the United Reserve Bank, divided into 100,000 shares, each share being 50 yuan. Each member paid half of the amount at the time of establishment, and the full amount was paid on June 10th, 1943. At the time of its initial establishment, it was jointly managed by Chinese and Japanese staff, so the chairman of the board of directors was Wang Yintai, a Chinese national, and the vice-chairman was Yamane Ei, a Japanese national. In addition, standing directors, directors, supervisors, and section chiefs of various bureaus were all appointed by Chinese and Japanese nationals. After the dismissal of Japanese directors and supervisors on March 31st, 1943, all Japanese staff of the General Federation and cooperative societies in various provinces and counties were all merged into the consultant's office. Today, the chairman of the board of directors is Tang Xiangming, and the vice-chairman is temporarily vacant. The standing directors are Lei Shourong and Zhang Zhiyuan, and the directors are Wang Yongzong, Chen Jinwen, Wan Zhaozhi, Zhou Daohui, and Li Pengxiang, eight people. The supervisors are Jin Shaowei and Wang Shoushan, two people. Under the board of directors, there are personnel and audit work offices directly under its jurisdiction. In addition, there are five bureaus for branch affairs, namely the General Affairs, Guidance, Finance, Undertakings, and Increased Production Bureaus. Under the bureaus are various sections. As for the provincial and county cooperative enterprise federations, there are also boards of directors and supervisors, but the provincial federation has five sections, namely the General Affairs, Guidance, Finance, Undertakings, and Production Guidance Sections, while the county federation only has five articles, namely General Affairs, Guidance, Finance, Undertakings, and Production Guidance, and there is one director in charge.</p>
<p>Agricultural Loan is the Main Task</p>
<p>The important work of the association lies in agricultural loans, agricultural product purchases, and increased production implementation. Because the General Federation of Cooperative Enterprises of North China has the power to control materials in North China and is also the only agricultural management organization in North China, during this year of increased production, the required funds have reached a huge amount of 15.55 million yuan. Among them, 12 million yuan is for spring plowing loans, 4 million yuan is for well drilling funds, 500,000 yuan is for waterwheel funds, 500,000 yuan is for collecting reed mats, 7.5 million yuan is for long-term funds for the construction of fixed facilities such as agricultural warehouses, 6.8 million yuan is for short-term funds for transportation and sales, purchasing agricultural products, and purchasing farmers' necessary materials for separate distribution, and 1.8 million yuan is for small agricultural loans. As for purchasing work, wheat is the main item, and other agricultural products such as cotton, miscellaneous grains, barley, and by-products such as reed mats and coarse cloth are also being brokered separately. In the 31st year, the total value of the brokering by the General Federation for various provinces and counties was more than 179.928 million yuan from the United Reserve Bank. In terms of increased production, the General Federation will establish millet seed nurseries in Liangxiang County in Hebei Province and Licheng Ziyang County in Shandong Province in accordance with the North China Food Increase Production Plan, using the excellent millet varieties Huabei Nong 1 and 2 cultivated at the North China Agricultural Experiment Field as the original seeds. It is estimated that the total amount of seeds harvested in the 31st year was 180,573 market catties. Last year, the seeds were selected in 15 key counties based on their characteristics, and 104,150 official mu were sown. At the same time, in order to make the increased production work more smooth, eight additional seed nurseries were established, with a total sowing area of 20,300 official mu.</p>
<p>Eight Principles of Organization and Operation</p>
<p>Finally, let's talk about the eight principles of the organization and operation of cooperative societies in North China. The so-called eight principles are: first, focusing on cooperative education; second, financial independence and self-management; third, joining by all households, so that cooperative societies are fully popularized in North China; fourth, non-distribution of public accumulation funds; fifth, the principle of proportional amortization of transaction amounts; sixth, adopting market price principles for distribution prices; seventh, limiting the interest on invested capital; and eighth, forming the total strength of cooperative societies. In this way, it seems that a moral or economic organization of this kind, generated in the form of a national policy organ, has made great contributions to the completion of the mission of the Greater East Asia construction base (North China). Originally, these eight principles were determined by Yamane Ei, the former vice-chairman of the association, and have now become the basic strategy for the General Federation of Cooperative Enterprises of North China's association affairs. Since the resignation of Vice-Chairman Yamane, the current position of consultant is held by Chisaka Takahiro. It is expected that the development of the General Federation's prospects will be more considerable in the future due to the renewal of its personnel.</p>

<h3>Iron Wall Defense Posture in the Philippines and Taiwan</h3>
<p>The Anglo-American counter-offensive operations against Japan are becoming more intense. Nimitz's Central Pacific breakthrough operations and the rampant special attack operations in the continental skies are also becoming more active. With the Bashi Channel as the center, the Philippines and Taiwan have become the focus of their spearhead, located in the center of the Greater East Asia war zone. The US Operations Headquarters has clearly designated Taiwan and the Philippines as one of its operational targets. The heavy responsibility borne by the Philippines and Taiwan is to resolutely crush its ambitions and connect the Japanese mainland with mainland China and the Southern Co-Prosperity Sphere. In order to prepare for the invasion of the enemy who is eager for a short-term decisive battle, the Philippines and Taiwan have now armed the entire island and become the fortress of Greater East Asia, establishing a defensive posture to defeat the arrogant enemy. The following is a local report on the recent situation in the Philippines and Taiwan.</p>
<h3>Philippines</h3>
<p>In the past, Roosevelt threatened that the future Pacific operations would be Nimitz's attack from the Marianas to Luzon Island and MacArthur's army's invasion of Mindanao.  In response to this extremely arrogant challenge, the Philippines transformed everything into combat power, determined to crush the United States.  President Laurel, in order to perfect the decisive battle situation, recently promulgated the Philippine Police Sentencing Law, strictly enforcing the discipline of the Philippine police, and ordered that anyone who makes false reports about weapons and other military supplies will be sentenced to imprisonment for up to twelve years, and those who lose weapons and ammunition will be sentenced to death.  The state of the Philippines in the decisive battle phase can be seen from this.</p>
<h3>The Rise of Japanese Residents</h3>
<p>Furthermore, the Japanese residents in Manila have also decided to arm themselves entirely.  In the past, Japanese residents already had neighborhood groups to simplify daily life such as distribution and to facilitate control, and engaged in building air-raid shelters and seeking self-sufficiency in food, etc., which has recently achieved considerable results.  However, today, this kind of passive defensive transformation into combat power is no longer satisfactory, so regional patriotic associations have been established in each workplace, quickly extracting one-tenth of the personnel to engage in military operations and construction, sweating profusely.  Uneducated reservists have also completed basic training and are learning bayonet techniques, training desperately amidst shouts of [charge][kill].  In this way, in today's situation where [if the enemy comes] has become [the enemy will definitely come], the Japanese residents have united as one, and their intention to destroy the arrogant enemy surges straight to the heavens.  On August 3rd, the chairman of the Central Luzon Branch of the Reservists and the head of the air defense unit issued an instruction: [The "Warriors' Group" should be established as soon as possible.]  [Whether neighborhood groups or air defense units, all have been deployed to the front lines.  In extraordinary times, extraordinary measures are necessary.  The Warriors' Group is an extraordinary measure.  This is the combat transformation of the spirit and actions of the neighborhood groups, turning its members into comrades-in-arms.]  [Enemy planes, don't go to Tokyo, come to Manila!] This is the sincere and genuine hope of the local Japanese.  This is the so-called intention to absorb and destroy the enemy.  In addition, regarding the uprising of Japanese residents in Manila, Consul General Shioya said: [Regarding the mobilization of resident Japanese for imminent war, we have been diligently studying and striving for it since this spring, and now we have implemented the reorganization of the Japanese Association and are arming the resident Japanese, centering on the air defense unit.  We have thoroughly realized the meaning of being constantly on the battlefield.  Today, the transformation into a decisive battle situation can be regarded as having reached a perfect state.]</p>
<h3>Taiwan</h3>
<p>Under the invasion operations of the enemy United States intending to break through the Central Pacific and open a route to China, Taiwan has gradually been exposed on the front line from its previous role as a supply base. Taiwan, known as an [unsinkable aircraft carrier], is bearing the heavy responsibility of crushing the enemy United States' ambition. Taiwan, facing a major juncture as the next decisive battleground, had already decisively implemented a total pre-emptive transformation, strengthening its defense capabilities, preparing the battlefield's industrial and economic situation, establishing a unified battlefield administration for immediate operations, and arming the entire island. This is for the perfection of Taiwan's own defense and to fully accomplish Taiwan's strategic mission. The Defense Headquarters and the Economic Mobilization Headquarters have been established, and their specific measures are:</p>
<p>1. Enhancing security forces and thoroughly implementing air defense.</p>
<p>2. Transforming technology, labor, and equipment and materials to the battlefield.</p>
<p>3. Increasing the self-sufficiency of battlefield necessities and maintaining economic order.</p>
<p>4. Organizing the entire island's population for the battlefield.</p>
<p>5. Establishing a battlefield administrative situation.</p>
<h3>Fortification of the Entire Island</h3>
<p>With these five points as the center, the entire island will be fortified, gathering all the mental and physical strength of the entire island, and establishing an invincible situation. Furthermore, Governor-General Hasegawa, Taiwan Army Commander Ando, ​​and Commander of the Kaohsiung Naval Defense District Fukuda will hold talks at any time—this can be called Taiwan's highest war guidance conference—to determine battlefield measures in response to the future war situation. Responding to the guidance and demands of the authorities, the entire island's population's determination for a decisive battle is very strong, and according to the guidelines for preparing the battlefield situation, the entire island's core of young and middle-aged people has united as one. The [Volunteer Patriotic Corps] has also been formed, serving as the core of local defense, stepping forward to engage in extraordinary security, and for the sake of vehicle demand production and food production increase, the conscription of young men and women throughout the island has been implemented since September 1. Furthermore, simultaneously with the fortification of the entire island, Taiwan also implemented a conscription system from September 1. Stimulated by the moving patriotic actions of the Takasago Volunteer Corps, all eligible persons on the island are determined to die for their country, and they receive rigorous training at special training centers for youth training established throughout the island in preparation for future inspections. With the implementation of this glorious conscription system, Taiwan has completed arming the entire island, and military officers and civilians have become a unified whole, in preparation for future wars, establishing an ironclad formation that exerts the power of an [unsinkable aircraft carrier]. (Translated from the Yomiuri Hochi, August 30)</p>
<h3>Prospects for the Decisive Battle on the Continent</h3>
<p>The United States' tendency to use China as the main battlefield for attacks against Japan is intensifying. Why doesn't the United States use its self-proclaimed massive naval and air power to attack Japan directly from the Pacific, but instead detours to attack Japan from China? This is, needless to say, because attacking Japan from the Pacific is absolutely impossible. The US military leadership themselves would admit this point. Since the Battle of the Solomon Islands until recently, in the battle for bases in the Southwest Pacific, the US military has made slight progress geographically, but this was purchased with a large consumption of personnel and supplies. If the two are compared, who can say that the US military has been successful? Moreover, most of the major strongholds in the Pacific are still in the hands of the Japanese army. Looking at it from both geographical and temporal perspectives, one must point out the failure of the US military.</p>
<h3>US Attempts to Sacrifice China</h3>
<p>This strategic failure has resulted in a lack of war resources within the United States, especially a shortage of rubber, leading to a sharp decline in both production quality and quantity, and the replenishment of personnel is also very difficult, thus intensifying the anti-war atmosphere among the people. Therefore, in order to break this predicament, the United States has no choice but to utilize China. This is to utilize China's strategic geographical conditions, sacrifice Chinese manpower and material resources, and dream of completing the war against Japan. For this reason, what the United States fears most is Chongqing's mid-way defection. This, for the United States itself, is the reason why they must deceive and cajole Chongqing. Therefore, no matter how difficult it is, they still have to send supplies. The visits of Wallace to Chongqing in the past, and the recent visits of Will Clayton and others to China, were all for this reason. It is not right to think of this as discussing matters such as US aid supplies.</p>
<h3>The Weakness of the US-Chongqing Air Force</h3>
<p>However, will this attack on Japan, based in China, progress as planned? Since the Japanese army launched an offensive in Henan, they quickly captured Luoyang, Changsha, and Hengyang, and launched operations to destroy the Chongqing army under the command of the US military. Now they have broken through the border of Guangxi Province from the north, and Guilin and Liuzhou are under serious threat. Although US aircraft have made several incursions into North Kyushu and the Manchurian region for air raids against Japan, the number of aircraft shot down each time accounted for 20% to 30% of the total number of aircraft attacking. In particular, the air raid on Anshan on the 8th resulted in even greater losses, reaching about 50%. Is there such an example in the history of world aviation? This is enough to prove the weakness of the US-Chongqing Air Force and the strength of the Japanese army. The failure of US operations and the exposure of its ambition to invade China have made the Chinese people suspicious of the true intentions of the United States. The cessation of resistance by Commander Fang and others in the Hengyang defense battle is one example.</p>
<h3>The Future of US-Chongqing Cooperation is Worrisome</h3>
<p>If the US strategy for Japan is absolutely impossible, then what will be the future of Chongqing, which is cooperating with the United States? Can today's actions repay the spirit of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen who revealed [Without Japan, there is no China] and pointed out that only by cooperating with Japan can China strive for its own independence? Japan has unlimited sympathy for Chongqing's mistake, from the standpoint of a friend of East Asia. The Japanese army declared on July 5: [If the Chongqing army ceases resistance, they are no longer our enemy.] This is a kind of expression. Whether Chongqing should turn left or right for the sake of its own independence has already been made clear. Japan's aviation production capacity has risen rapidly and is eager to deal a heavy blow to the US military as soon as the opportunity ripens, so that it cannot rise again. Japan's aircraft production has already jumped to second place in the world. Although the United States is said to be in first place, most of it must be allocated to Europe, so in terms of quality, it is no match for Japan. The impending decisive battle will be an opportunity to proclaim Japan's true power to the world. (By Yamamoto Naval Press Corps Member from a certain base) (Translated by Yoshi) Bai Mao</p>
<h3>Ninth Anniversary of Death</h3>
<p>— Ming Yan</p>
<p>Nine years, Father! I have never forgotten everything about you. I remember your smile and even more your furrowed brows; yes, ever since Mother left us, you haven't had a day without furrowed brows. Under the dim lamplight, in the lonely starry and moonlit nights, there were only a few children who had lost their loving mother accompanying you. Not only could you not pour out your sorrow to the children, but you also had to suppress your tears and comfort the ignorant children who were clamoring for their mother and the old grandmother who had lost her beloved daughter. However, we could already hear you murmuring in sorrow:</p>
<p>[Lonely empty room, setting sun's faint ray, /  Bleak cold moon ascends the solitary curtain, /  Most heartbreaking, the sick children, /  Still hoping for Mother's return before the lamp.]</p>
<p>[Grandmother's sorrow unbearable, /  Never expected to shed tears for you, /  Even a small parting usually clinging, /  How much more, an eternal farewell in the Yellow Springs!]</p>
<p>Eternal farewell! Father, who would have thought that one day five years later, you would also fulfill this terrible [eternal farewell] with us!</p>
<p>You were forced to leave us when your life's journey had only just begun! Even though you were so unwilling and unbearable. Huddling on the sickbed, holding out a pair of trembling hands, pointing to the children around the bed, begging the doctor:</p>
<p>[Save me, I can't die!] Although the doctor tried his best to say it was alright, you were extremely reluctant to part with life, and at the same time, you feared that the coercion of death would make you leave this group of children that you couldn't let go of, that you couldn't put your heart down! You wanted to live, not because you were afraid of death, but because you knew that this family would be broken, separated, and scattered in an instant! As long as you couldn't take that last breath!</p>
<p>I am angry! I am afraid! I dare not think about what death is. I hate [death] because it has taken away everything I love; the only true love in the world, in my hurried arrival, has been quickly taken away by it. Its hand cares for my entire life, causing me to fall into loneliness, monotony, and groping indifferently on the vast dark road. No matter how much I shout and beg, it has no pity or sympathy!</p>
<p>Memories are like a needle pricking my heart – I remember this day nine years ago; what a terrible night it was. The spring breeze was a bit irritating, and there were groans on the third floor of Baolong Hospital. Everything was so quiet, but in the quietness, there was a simmering anxiety. When I stepped into the ward, the strings of my heart began to tremble. I saw Father lying painfully on the bed, his eyes half-open and slightly closed. Everyone in the room had a tense and anxious expression, looking at Father. I imagined a series of illusions, I thought of the past, I thought of the present, I thought of the future. I thought of every lovely gesture when Father was living healthily, his smile was kind, but with a sternness in his kindness. I hoped that he could be safely discharged from the hospital and restore our original happy life. Suddenly, my illusion was interrupted by an external commotion. What I heard was my stepmother's frightened low cry, she softly calling Father's name with a trembling voice, and my seventh uncle looking at Father's face with a panicked expression. I leaned closer to the bed and saw Father's chest rising and falling rapidly, his throat gurgling with wet phlegm, his face gradually reddening, but then slowly turning ashen. A stream of cold silence was exchanged in the air, everyone quietly listening to the beating of another's pulse. Father's breathing became rougher and more rapid, and the strings of my heart vibrated more violently. In that instant of struggling between [life] and [death], I was painfully experiencing: The end of life is truly too tragic!</p>
<p>In the distance, a car splashing rain became the coda and disappeared into the darkness. The father who had been carried away had become another object, he no longer belonged to this world: did the world abandon him or did he abandon the world? In short, he had escaped from the painful [life] and entered the quiet land of [death]. The responsibility he unloaded was thus shared by us, he began his eternal rest and would no longer be anyone's ox or horse!</p>
<p>Nine years, Father! You went too far away! How can we tell you how we have drifted in the sea of ​​people, how we have spent these nine years in the bleak wind and bitter rain? Nine years is not a short time, but it has slipped away like a flash of lightning. We have all stepped from children to adults, Father! If you could open your eyes and take another look, you would surely be amazed: Your children have grown much taller!...</p>
<h3>Graduation</h3>
<p>— Xiao Jing</p>
<p>○ Graduated, a full nine years, only now has it come to a conclusion. This is something to be happy about. The purpose of writing this article is to commemorate it, because I am saying goodbye to the school from now on!</p>
<p>○ Nine years have passed leisurely. The faces of all the teachers and students, I have seen so many, but they are always the same ordinary and indifferent. All the textbooks and all the teachings, I have also been exposed to a lot, and they are always the same rigid and dry. I don't have the emotion to get close to them, because it seems that there is a river between us, and we are opposing each other as the other shore. After nine years of effort, the river has washed us further and further away, but this relationship still exists and is still united, until today.</p>
<p>○ In the past nine years, I have also tasted the sweetness and bitterness of life, but this sweetness and bitterness also seems to be too light, almost losing its taste. Nine years ago, I entered school with a [indifferent and ignorant] heart, and nine years later, I left school with an even more [indifferent and ignorant] heart, but the initial emotion was innocent and pure, while the current one has been infected with some of the indifference of the world and the stubborn breath of life.</p>
<p>○ I am disappointed, tired, and hateful, wasting my time in mediocre faces, rigid books, and indifferent human taste!</p>
<p>○ But I want to commemorate it, and those scattered memories, because indirectly, I also discovered my own strength, what is justice, what is heresy, and struggling to break through this net.</p>
<p>○ I am willing to forget everything in the past, like a spring dream, let it arise and perish on its own. Life is too precious, I want to use it to make a contribution in the great era, not let it be wasted, decadent, and return to destruction. Therefore, crossing over the life of the school, I have restarted my own long journey and created my own new world!</p>
<p>○ Graduated, I get rid of everything in the past, all the ignorant waste of life.</p>
<p>○ After graduating, I arm myself with everything, everything to cultivate the future.</p>
<p>○ Farewell to the other side of the river! But learning is never-ending!</p>
<h3>Night</h3>
<p>— Jiang Shui</p>
<p>The neighbors next door have the sound of Mahjong tiles, breaking the silence. The electric lights are shining brightly; people probably don't know that the night is deep. Outside the door, there is the sound of knocking bamboo tubes selling wontons. I seem to see the lonely black shadow under that lonely street lamp...</p>
<h3>Shadow</h3>
<p>— Jiang Shui</p>
<p>In a quiet and humble alley, in a silent small room, you are always guarding by my side, I will not feel lonely. It is dusk, you come quietly, I know that when I turn off the light, you, lonely friend! will leave me. But I wait and wait, waiting for you to come with tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Dedication – For the Student Aid Fund Chinese and Western Music Concert –</h3>
<p>— Tang Tao</p>
<p>Autumn is the season of music. Whether it is [listening to autumn through the chirping of insects], or [the sound is among the trees], this is a clever design of nature, using the singing of hibernating cold cicadas, crickets weaving, white poplars and green paulownias, reeds and plantains, in the moonlit night, in the sparse rain, to lightly cultivate temperament, comfort the soul, and eliminate the heavy, turbid, and tired feeling left over from the deep heat of summer.</p>
<p>Autumn is the season of music.</p>
<p>However, when we turn around and look, what we are in is the city, what we see are tall buildings, the architecture of the twentieth century. Even if there is a patch of grass in front of us, a few street trees, with one or two autumn insects perched on them, how poor that is! Sighing at the bitterness of the times, the suffocation of life, people need to vent from the bottom of their hearts, need to entrust themselves, and cannot but seek higher and greater comfort beyond the rhythms of nature. At this time, they naturally remember Boya, remember Pei Luoer, remember Chopin, remember Liszt; imagine the romantic figures of ancient times, the extravagance of the Six Dynasties, the echoing corridors in the palace of the King of Wu, the Linchun Pavilion by the roadside in Taicheng, the wonderful dances, and the fast flutes and complicated strings, listening to a melodious tune, even if it doesn't cause a complete downfall, it is still intoxicating! Even more, imagine the musical hero Beethoven slowly coming along a secluded autumn path outside the Pengfu suburbs. He approaches a small house, the night wind blows out the candle, and moonlight intrudes through the window, meltingly shining on the blind girl who is playing the piano, on the keyboard of the piano, clear, serene, pure, white, quiet. The musician with disheveled long hair couldn't help but play that eternally outstanding [Moonlight Sonata].</p>
<p>Autumn is the season of music.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, in autumn, it is also easy for us to think of spring, and this term is often symbolic, sometimes it is the spring of life – childhood; sometimes it is the spring of mankind – children. From the spring of life to the spring of mankind, that is, from one's own childhood to all the children who are currently in their childhood, a feeling of sympathy arises spontaneously. If the meaning of life is not only in [acquiring], but also in [giving], then facing those innocent children who have to stop their studies due to the pressure of poverty, everyone is willing to extend a helping hand. This is the reason why the concert is held, and also why it is held at this time and in this place.</p>
<p>Using music to help education, holding onto spring in autumn.</p>
<p>(Editor's Note: The Student Aid Fund Chinese and Western Music Concert is sponsored by Lianhua Bank and Shenbao News, with the National Music Research Association and the National Conservatory of Music as the main bodies, and other famous musicians and singers are invited to participate. It will be performed publicly at the Da Xin Grand Theater on October 2, 3, 5, and 6.)</p>

<h3>The Issue of the Chinese Team's Lineup for the China-Russia Volleyball Match</h3>
<p>This year's men's and women's volleyball league has long passed. At the press conference, this publication mentioned that the women's side has indeed made progress compared to before. On the men's side, there have been no significant achievements. Recently, the Russian Emigrant Sports Association, in view of its participation in the city's volleyball league in the past, and due to unfamiliarity with the Far Eastern rules, ultimately failing, felt particularly unwilling. Recently, it sent a letter of challenge to Liang Zhaoan, director of the China Youth Sports Department. After several discussions, the Chinese team decided to organize a China Youth team to compete against them, using American system and Far Eastern system three games each. The venue is also three games at China Youth and three games at Russian Sports Association, in order to average it out. Deciding who is stronger in these six major battles, we can undoubtedly appreciate the improvement of the level of men's volleyball. It is truly a grand event in this year's volleyball scene.</p>
<p>The China Youth team gathers the elite of the Chinese strong teams, Yuehua White Team, and Huaying Team, as well as Guo Douzhao of Yongsheng and Zhang Rui of Yizhong, who are outstanding in the B group. The list has already been seen in various newspapers and is no different from the Chinese team representative, so this match obviously contains international competition and will be watched by fans.</p>
<p>It is found that the Russian team has indeed made deep achievements in the American rules, but seems unfamiliar with the Far Eastern rules. However, since they have the ambition to challenge the Chinese team, they should be prepared. How can we easily despise them? Seeing that the visitors are unkind, the reporter dares to make my own suggestion on the lineup distribution of the China Youth team, so-called knowing oneself and knowing the enemy, so that one can win every battle.</p>
<h3>Far Eastern Lineup Can Reach an Ideal State</h3>
<p>The Far Eastern rules are the nine-person system used in the China Youth competition. Our Chinese athletes are accustomed to this, and naturally drive on a familiar road, but the materials in this list are all superior, and it may be difficult to distribute them. In my opinion, the front row should use Chen Xuechong on the left, Tan Yongzhan in the middle, and Li Binzhong on the right. The reason is that all three can score points, taking the lead, and all three have considerable height, which is also beneficial for the net. Furthermore, Tan has cooperated with Xuechong in the past, and has joined forces with Binzhong this year, so he can be resourceful, so what fear is there of things not naturally falling into place? There is no problem in using Wang Deyuan on the second row on the left. Use Hou Ruoyu, because Hou is a all-around player in defense and attack. The right-hand man is quite costly to study. Whether Yuan Bingqiu can be competent on the right is a question. Cheng Shining has more than enough defense, but his attack is insufficient. Guo Douzhao lacks experience and is difficult to take on the big task. In desperation, I think that we can only use vehicle tactics depending on the situation at the time. The third row can use the original team from Yuehua. What must be noted is that the three-row play of the Cantonese always has the shortcoming of going too far forward, which seems to have a historical heredity. If so, the three rows may be able to employ another general who is more static to make up for this deficiency. If this lineup is used to meet the enemy, it can be called ideal, and it is inevitable to drink to celebrate the victory.</p>
<h3>The Distribution of American Rules Must Be Carefully Considered</h3>
<p>The American rules use a six-person system, in which each person's position changes after serving. Only when rotating to the front row does one have a chance to spike, and when rotating to the second row, one can only defend and not attack. Therefore, the deployment of this lineup should first consider what the opponent's lineup will be when they take the field, and how the changes will be made after the rotation, and then make your own lineup to compete with it, so that you can achieve twice the result with half the effort. I don't have a deep understanding of the Russian generals' front lines, and under such circumstances, the only element of the American rules that we need to consider is the [one-set-one-hit system]. The two must have considerable tacit understanding, of course, this is definitely not the best policy, and it is currently unavoidable. Fortunately, people can be adjusted in one game, so you can adapt to the changing circumstances according to the battle situation at the time. As for the three pairs that the Chinese team can match this time, the three pairs in the reporter's mind are: ○ Wang Deyuan and Cheng Shining. The two have been in the same team for a long time, and they must join the Xiqing every year. They have accumulated experience and should be able to handle it. ○ Mai Bingyao and Tan Yongzhan. Fans know Mai's set and Tan's quick hit. What I am worried about is whether Tan is accustomed to spiking with a higher net. I think Tan's experience is old and sophisticated, and he can win with surprise, and he can refresh our ears and eyes. ○ Chen Xuechong and Hou Ruoyu or Zhang Rui. Hou's ability and experience are better than Zhang's, but in fact, Zhang's caution in the American system can surpass Hou's. Moreover, Zhang has fought a lot in the American system in the past, so he should abandon Hou and use Zhang. Looking at the above six people, each has the ability to set, hit, and spike. In this case, they can cope with it easily in the face of battle, and although victory is not guaranteed, the performance will definitely be wonderful.</p>
<h3>Discussion on the Main Points of Guidance</h3>
<p>Regarding the aforementioned humble opinions, a certain question that will arise is that when adopting the Far Eastern rules, the authorities should generally use Chen Xuechong on the left, Tan Yongzhan in the center, and Mai Bingyao on the right for the front line, utilizing Mai's skill in setting the ball. However, Mai is accustomed to playing in the center, and if he is suddenly moved to the right, it will be difficult for him to develop his skills. If he is placed in the center and Tan is moved to the right, then Tan may not be accustomed to this either. However, this reporter observes that with Li Baozhong on the right using his left hand to pull and spike, and Chen Xuechong on the left using his right hand to spike, they complement each other from afar, and with Lao Tan in the center either setting or spiking, only then can perfection be achieved. What does the coach, Mr. Qi, think? Mr. Qi has lived in Hong Kong for a long time and is the editor of a sports newspaper. He has unique insights on various ball games, especially volleyball, which he has studied the most. This reporter's humble opinions await his guidance.</p>
<h3>Portuguese Reds Retain Championship Title</h3>
<p>— Miao Shan</p>
<p>This year's Shanghai Baseball League concluded successfully last Sunday. The championship was retained by the Portuguese Reds (Lusitan Reds). They also won the championship last year in the final against the Western Youth team. This year, the Western Youth team narrowly defeated the strong Chinese team, the Pandas, to win the right to the final, but unfortunately, they were not as good as their opponents and performed poorly, losing to the Portuguese Reds by a score of two to six.</p>
<h3>Championship-Winning Portuguese Reds Have Strong Offense</h3>
<p>The defeat of the Western Youth team was just like the Pandas' defeat to the Portuguese team. In the first inning, three consecutive hits by the Portuguese Reds put runners on all bases, creating a dangerous situation with the bases loaded. At this time, Fat Tang was at bat, and the Western Youth team, knowing the danger of his skillful hits, gave him a [walk to first base], and the Portuguese team gained a point for nothing. But when Fortune swung his bat, he seemed to be divinely assisted, and the ball flew straight through the outfield along the first base line, and the three runners on base returned home one after another. Later, V. Su hit the ball again and brought Fortune home, and the Western Youth team lost a fatal five points in this inning, making it impossible to recover. The Portuguese team's ability to win really relied on their strong offensive power, which was unmatched by other teams.</p>
<h3>Western Youth Players Perform Mediocrely</h3>
<p>The Western Youth team's ball skills are far inferior to those of the Pandas, but they won because the referee favored them. The team's Japanese players, Mr. Ueshima and Mr. Iwata, both studied in the United States and have excellent ball skills. However, in the final, Ueshima's performance was very abnormal, repeatedly missing the ball, so he was not as steady as Liang Yousheng, the famous player of the Pandas who studied in Japan. Moreover, the Western Youth team's pitcher, Kejimilov, was not as good as Li Qiteng of the Pandas. Li's pitches are fast and have curves, and his posture is beautiful. His future is truly limitless. The Western Youth team used a bunt, the only way to kill the Portuguese team, to regain two points, but their offensive power was still too weak, which led to their inability to reverse the defeat. Also, today (the 24th) at 10 am and next Sunday, there will be two exhibition games at Jiaozhou Park, which is the mixed-team championship. Four players from the Pandas have also been selected, which is also a wonderful embellishment before the end of this year's baseball season.</p>
<h3>News Items</h3>
