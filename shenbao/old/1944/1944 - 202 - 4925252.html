<p>代論</p>
<h3>日本新內閣成立</h3>
<p>— 陳彬</p>
<p>問：日本此次內閣改組，外間傳說紛紜，願　真實？</p>
<p>答：外間關於日本群組內閣的浮言，不外三種：</p>
<p>第一種誤認日本此次改組內閣，由於最近塞班島之陷落。其實此說僅為時間上之巧合，因塞島之失，在軍事上意義不大，若為一小島而致改組內閣，不免過甚其詞，</p>
<p>第二種浮言，誤認日本內部發生意見，此說尤屬不顧事實。因為最近陸軍在大陸作戰之順利，對於太平洋上海軍作戰　力極大，同時，塞班島壯烈抵禦之事　，更為日本海陸軍人忠勇愛國之結晶。今日小磯陸軍大將米內海軍大將組成協力內閣，更足以粉碎此種流言。</p>
<p>第三浮言，誤認為日本此次改組內閣，在軍政外交政策三面或有所改變，然而請續日本背後內閣之就職廣播，更可完全瞭解此種浮言之無稽。</p>
<p>問：然則，請問日本此次內閣改組之真實意義如何？</p>
<p>答：簡單的說，就只是為了適應國際及東亞戰局決戰階段的需要。</p>
<p>大東西戰爭迄今二年有半，在東條內閣領導之下，軍事上　古禾有的勝利，為世人所共知，下海雞皮疙瘩的收　，尤其是對華新政策之實踐，大東亞省之成立，大東亞共同宣言之發表，於團結東亞十億民話建立大東亞新秩序，尤為不可否認的功績。</p>
<p>最近敵美　　挽救已失的民心，維斯福並作競選四屆總統的張本，　　民心，不惜傾舉全力，企圖冒險進　日本本土，由馬紹而　島之偷襲，至塞班島之登陸，尤足見敵方操心急切。所以時至今日，戰爭實已進入決戰階段。東條內閣為使人心一新，適應時局，毅然初等總　職，避讓賢路，乃有陸海軍民協力內閣的組成，擔負起決定大東亞全民命運的歷史使命。</p>
<p>問：日本新內閣為據負此歷史的使命，將修東條內閣的政綱政策否？</p>
<p>答：道德我們得認清，基於日本基本國策「八　一字」精神而發動的大東亞戰爭，必將堅持完　勝利，因此，新內閣也必將合軍民衝力而擴張東修內閣之戰果。最主要的，自然將是陸海軍更緊密的配合，尤其是財界與民間卓越人才之合作，為新內稅最大的特點。同時，重光外相之兼任大東東亞亞相，對東條內閣之外交政策，必將繼續推進，去掉的「大東亞共同宣言」，更將有貫徹實現的期待。</p>
<p>問：日本新閣與中日關係前途如何？</p>
<p>答：此次日本新內閣成立，最使我國朝野感覺非常感奮者，就是新閣員，者為我國朝野所期待的人物，期間尤熟悉中國了解中國的軍·政·經濟·文化界名人，過去對中國會表現其異常的熱情。</p>
<p>我們始終誰，大東亞戰爭是全東亞民族解放的戰爭，必須以東亞全民族團結的力量，貫徹戰爭，才能確保勝利，尤以中日兩大民族的團結，更為重要。簡言之，日本無對華政策之　功，即無大東亞戰爭之最後勝利。因此，我們深信，日本新內閣必將以更大之努力，貫徹東條內閣時代之對華政策，扶助我完全實現自由獨立與復興建設。不過，這一偉大事業，最主要的是我們自主的奮發，有待於我國政府之徹底革新。</p>
<p>因此，我們對於日本這次改組內閣，除了特別感到在此決戰階段我國應負起參戰國家所應負的使命之外，尤其竭誠盼望國民政府有更進一步和更徹底的革新，和日本一樣更健全人事，軍·政·官·民密切合作，成為強有力的國民政府，協力完　大東亞戰爭勝利解放東亞民族的總目標。</p>
<h3>軍政謀澈底強化完遂大東亞戰爭　日新任閣員披瀝重大信念</h3>
<p>東京二十三日中央社電　小　新首相二十二日下午七時半於首相官邸，初次會見內閣記者團，席間就記者所問詳作解答。對下列兩點闡述尤詳，明示新內閣今後處理各項政務之方針。　為獲得戰爭最後勝利，使全國民精神明朗闊達，最為緊要，故大和民族之「大和一致」絕對必要，如是始克最　　意，如能增加戰意。　於戰時下統帥與國務緊密協力必要，蓋無統帥即無國務，因之遂行國務時，應明確統帥之方向，把握國策。</p>
<h3>首相闡明施政要點</h3>
<p>茲再志與記者問答如次：（問）處於此決戰階段，對國政運營之根本方針為何？（答）昂揚戰意與與增加生產，即為本論之結論，亦即所謂兼備灶神的與物質的兩面。吾等日本人民莫不深體神意，故每於國難之時，鹹能拾棄私怨，強力團結，此實為我日本人之美點。然於強力團結時，首先昂揚國民之明朗闊達精神，於和　之氣氛內增強戰力，此即精神之基本。對於物質方面，當確保最低限度之國民生活，同時更須官民共同協力，因而昂揚國民之和　精神，除去舊日之惰性，使透徹明　國　本　，此勿僅在教育　　，即社會機關亦擔當其才華之實，如大政　贊會竺，即為達成此種目的之最好機關。確保國民生活之具體政策，為物的生產，增產目的達成後，以其收穫初等適當配給。（問）新幾閣之統帥與國務之具體方式如何？（答）日本現已處於苛烈之戰爭狀態下同，幫國務不能不歸於統帥，換言之，統帥包括國務及中銀狀態之形式，欲推行國務，則不能不認識此點之所在。為達此目的，必須強化從來之政府統帥連絡會議，具更須使之實質化，其戰爭之指導性，以及戰爭與國務連成一致。（問）為應付世界戰局，如何推進對　蘇之外交？（答）善於對德蘇外交，　　　堅持從來之緊密敦睦盟邦關係，凝視戰局，向完遂戰爭推進，此點勿須本人　言。善於對辦外交，將維持迄今之敦睦關係，今後仍相互排除兩者間一切不喜悅。　　之發生。至中立國方面，亦始終於物質精神兩方面，維持友好關係，尤其對大東亞各國家及各民族，更欲期親密關係無所遺憾。</p>
<h3>推進善鄰外交　實現共同宣言　重光外相發表抱負</h3>
<p>東京二十三日中央社電，日重光外相兼大東亞相，二十三日下午於外想官邸撞見記者，就新內閣之對外政策發表談話，其大意謂：新內閣這對外政策已由首相說明，今繼續過去決不變更，本人留任外相兼大東亞相，將要方針向邁進。第一，與同盟國緊密協力完成戰爭，尤注重日德之協力關係。第二，澈底實現帝國之大東亞政策。大東亞宣言。中日同盟條約，以謀東亞解放復興，此乃國際之正義亦即日本戰爭之目的。第三，日本將與中立國及隣接各國推行善隣友好關係。因此次大戰實係為自存自衛不得已之戰爭，及受敵人挑撥而致，與之干戈相見。日本帝國之目的，在分佈國際正義於世界，以期與各國樹立善隣友好關係，以上各點乃經議會通過，並經屢次向世界　明之我國基本外交政策，新內閣仍將繼續　力強力推進，本人決與外務。大東亞兩省，國內外之同僚同志共同努力，嚴加初等。善於大東亞政策，最重要者乃在團結大東亞和民族之　心，使其均能發揮力全協力戰爭，集結物資，固亦完成戰爭不可或缺者，倘有民族趕忙團結後，物資之集結，當須在大東亞各國之相互利益及全體利益下推行。善於對外問題，總理大臣及陸海兩相於　重商討後，意見已　一致，今後對外政策將與軍事表　一體，而強力推行之也。</p>
<h3>發揚傳統精神　爭取最後勝利　陸海兩相剴切訓示</h3>
<p>東京二十三日中央社電　　日　相杉山元帥廿三日上午初臨陸軍省，二時廿分於該大禮堂召集省內全體將校捌切訓示，披　决戰信念。十一時於會見東條前陸相辦理事務移交後，接見記者團發表談话如次：戰局已入重大之階段，余任為陸軍大臣，深感責任重大，除感激外，並不勝恐懼。於克服目前難局，軍心應再强力團結，發揚鬥志，勇進奮戰下應緊密與海軍協力，粉碎敵人，故一億國民應渾然一體，向必勝之途邁進，實為最要。為達成必勝信念，雖粉身碎骨，在所不辭，今後唯有奮力突破一切障礙，以獲最後勝利。</p>
<p>東京二十三日中央社電　日新海軍大臣米內光政大將，廿二日下午十時於海相官邸，首次會見海軍記者團，披瀝日政府對完遂戰爭之決心。其大旨如次：余深　戰爭　在勝利，除勝利外別無他策。戰爭之要諦，在於毅然行其所信，余深感當務之急，　為滿足前綫将兵之需要，如前線需要飛機一千梁，即應照數供給之，譬如承包工作，資材缺乏時可以撤手，戰爭則决不然，近代戰即係總力戰，總力必須全員出力工作，擔任指導者尤應身體力行，分頭指揮工作。又戰爭如求取勝，端在人和，故全國民必須一致密切合作，以來發揮總力戰。所謂協力，並非一個意見盲從其他之意見，要在某過程中兩者相互切磋，各發揮其堅强所信，此次小磯大將舆余拜受組閣大命，即係協力之意，此後　望朝野下吝教言以捕不足，為期完遂任務，將始終協力，　全力以　聖慮也。</p>

<h3>金融工商巿况　上週穩定</h3>
<p>滬市上週問金融與工商各業巿况，穩定如恒，烚赤漲後見平，紋銀盤旋不動，公定市價均無樊化，銀根因地內需要收買農產物品之資金殷切而趨緊。錢業拆息，掛升四角三分，旋以中儲儘量供給正當需要頭寸，始轉寬鬆，拆息回至四角，股票市况則因當局嚴密注意投機之取締，空頭交易斂跡，股市稍見轉機，人心均看好，此於企業前途，進展有望，各業食用物品因金融之嚴厲，故物價已見回跌，尤其米糧市價，輸運來源見暢，征購米糧限度，寬放十石以上征收，並有恢復戶口米之消息，是以民食日形安定，米價黑巿已向跌大關內，恐慌情形，漸見消減。</p>
<h3>各地米糧問題的檢討</h3>
<p>內地的米價，向爲上海的米價所左右。此次新措置發表以後的啼形環境，又僅使上海與內地的米價同趨激漲。但在新措置發表以前，內地米價已在激漲中。例如松江，自四月底迄五月上旬止的十日間，己高漲了百分之九十，某人曾對記者談其眞相如次：</p>
<p>米統會向農民和米商收買，於四月底截止。此後即以市價自由收買。是以大家都相信，祗要有米，就可以高偎出賣。米商亦預料市價即將激漲，決不吐出所囤之米，觀望形勢。是以自四月底起，激漲極厲。這次激漲中，一定有上海方面腐敗民族資本的策動。</p>
<p>這樣開始趨漲的內地米價，被後來因發表米糧新措置而上海發生糾紛與不安所刺激。態漲愈高，並也因上海米便的漸告安定而同趨穩定。</p>
<p>上海與各地間米價的相差，令人難於嚴信記者歷訪的四地區，從上海乘火車出發，均在一二小時內可到達，然米價的相差每石遠四千元。在松江某一時與上海市價的相差爲達六千元之鉅。各地物資因地域的不同而有價格差別的畸形狀况。本爲統制上的癌，堪予憂慮，但上海松江間，上海蘇州問如上述每石相差遠四千元，誠爲決戰下的奇觀。且在最近，上海配給米的價格，比農村的市價還廉，彼此對照起來，米糧問題的前途，愈感困難重重。</p>
<p>上述不能置信的價格差別之存在，究竟怎樣造成的呢？搬入上海米糧的絕對量之不足，亦爲其重要原因之一。但上海一夜中有一二千元的漲落，這不能一定說是絕對量之不是所致。現在的搬入量，比以前一點也不減少，甚至多少增加了一些，可是竟有米價暴漲的現象。先前在棉紗棉布，黃金，股藥方面的囤積投機，現在集中於米糧了，何況在這嚴重的靑黃不接時期呢？</p>
<p>囤積對策要諦</p>
<p>去年四月以來，會大聲疾呼消減投機囤積，爲謀其實現，雖採用了各種施策，依然猖獗如故。且民心也因強制收買紗有，槍殺貪污分子等後，並不積施有力施策的緣故，以爲取締囤積投機是不可能的。一部有識之士的中間，亦有以爲彈壓囤積的施策有背於經濟法則者。然而對於在四萬五千萬民衆面前，不在東亞十億民族的眼前，公然如此猖獗的反常形想，不發動一切有力手段，眞能確立這一國參戰體制嗎？對於輕視囤積對策的人們，記者想告訴他們在蘇州與無錫所聽到的后大椿與胡政槍決後的反響：</p>
<p>后大椿，胡政處刑的處置，對江蘇省民衆給與前所未有的好影饗。甚至於對國府向來不表好意的人們，也開始相信國府的今後將有改善了。民衆看見二氏槍決照相時的震動，幾可與大東亞戰爭勃發時相比擬。在日本人自然不能贊同以爲后胡的搶決比大東亞戰爭的　震動還要厲害，但祗因後者是直接有關中國民衆生活的問題，故民衆的歡呼，極爲深刻。物價也因這事件的結果而安定了相當期間。把握民心的要諦，不是複雜寫遠理論與方針，而是使工人，農民舉起雙手贊成的簡單而決斷的一，二個字。現在龍够見到在靑黃不接期的米每天有二，三千元上落的純經濟現象之綠由者，百不得一，而如囤積貪污分子的別抉，正如最簡明的決斷之一。在這新階段，不待說，祇有這種形式才是唯一的打開的方策。然而無論何種施策，或方策，實行時，寶須還都以夾所未有的重大決心以處之。（譯自六月二十八日大陸新報）</p>

<h3>Establishment of the New Japanese Cabinet</h3>
<p>— Chen Bin</p>
<p>Q: There are many rumors circulating about the recent cabinet reshuffle in Japan. What is the truth?</p>
<p>A: There are mainly three kinds of rumors circulating about the Japanese cabinet reshuffle:</p>
<p>The first is the mistaken belief that the current cabinet reshuffle in Japan is due to the recent fall of Saipan. In fact, this is just a coincidence in timing, because the loss of Saipan is not of great military significance. It would be an exaggeration to reshuffle the cabinet because of a small island.</p>
<p>The second rumor is the mistaken belief that internal conflicts have arisen within Japan. This is even more inconsistent with the facts. Because of the recent success of the army's operations on the mainland, the naval operations in the Pacific have been greatly strengthened. At the same time, the heroic defense of Saipan is a crystallization of the loyalty and patriotism of the Japanese army and navy. Today, the formation of a cooperative cabinet by General Koiso of the Army and Admiral Yonai of the Navy is enough to shatter this kind of rumor.</p>
<p>The third rumor is the mistaken belief that the current cabinet reshuffle in Japan will bring about changes in military, political, and diplomatic policies. However, please listen to the inaugural broadcast of the Japanese behind-the-scenes cabinet, and you can fully understand the absurdity of this rumor.</p>
<p>Q: Then, what is the real significance of the Japanese cabinet reshuffle?</p>
<p>A: Simply put, it is just to meet the needs of the decisive stage of the international and East Asian war situation.</p>
<p>It has been two and a half years since the Greater East Asia War began. Under the leadership of the Tojo cabinet, the unprecedented military victories have been known to the world. The gains are particularly evident in the implementation of the new policy toward China, the establishment of the Greater East Asia Ministry, and the issuance of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, which are undeniable achievements in uniting the 1 billion people of East Asia and establishing a new order in Greater East Asia.</p>
<p>Recently, the enemy America is trying to salvage its lost popular support. Roosevelt is also preparing for his fourth presidential election. In order to win popular support, they are sparing no effort to take risks and invade the Japanese mainland, from the sneak attack on the Marshall Islands to the landing on Saipan, which shows the enemy's anxiety. Therefore, the war has now entered a decisive stage. In order to refresh people's minds and adapt to the situation, the Tojo cabinet resolutely resigned from the position of Prime Minister and made way for capable people. Therefore, a cooperative cabinet of the army, navy, and people was formed to shoulder the historical mission of determining the fate of all people in Greater East Asia.</p>
<p>Q: Will the new Japanese cabinet revise the policy platform of the Tojo cabinet in order to shoulder this historical mission?</p>
<p>A: We must recognize that the Greater East Asia War, which was launched based on the spirit of Japan's basic national policy of "Hakko Ichiu," will certainly be insisted upon until complete victory. Therefore, the new cabinet will also combine the strength of the military and the people to expand the achievements of the Tojo cabinet. The most important thing, of course, will be the closer cooperation between the army and the navy, especially the cooperation between the financial community and outstanding talents from the private sector, which is the biggest feature of the new cabinet. At the same time, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu's concurrent position as Minister of Greater East Asia will certainly continue to promote the diplomatic policy of the Tojo cabinet, and there will be an expectation to thoroughly realize the "Greater East Asia Joint Declaration."</p>
<p>Q: What is the prospect of the relationship between the new Japanese cabinet and China?</p>
<p>A: The most encouraging thing for our country, both in the government and among the public, about the establishment of the new Japanese cabinet is that the new cabinet members are figures expected by our country, both in the government and among the public, and many of them are celebrities in the military, political, economic, and cultural circles who are familiar with China and understand China and have shown extraordinary enthusiasm for China in the past.</p>
<p>We have always believed that the Greater East Asia War is a war of liberation for all East Asian nations. We must use the power of unity of all East Asian nations to carry out the war in order to ensure victory. In particular, the unity of the two major nations of China and Japan is even more important. In short, without Japan's success in its policy toward China, there will be no final victory in the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, we firmly believe that the new Japanese cabinet will make greater efforts to implement the policy toward China during the Tojo cabinet era and help us fully realize freedom, independence, and reconstruction. However, the most important thing for this great cause is our independent efforts, which depend on the thorough reform of our government.</p>
<p>Therefore, in addition to feeling particularly that our country should assume the mission that a participating country should bear at this decisive stage, we sincerely hope that the National Government will have further and more thorough reforms, and like Japan, have a more sound personnel system and close cooperation between the military, government, officials, and people to become a strong national government, working together to achieve the overall goal of winning the Greater East Asia War and liberating the East Asian nations.</p>
<h3>Thoroughly Strengthen Military and Political Affairs to Complete the Greater East Asia War: New Japanese Cabinet Members Express Important Beliefs</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – New Prime Minister Koiso met with the cabinet press corps for the first time at the Prime Minister's official residence at 7:30 p.m. on the 22nd, and answered the reporters' questions in detail. He elaborated on the following two points in particular, indicating the new cabinet's future policy in handling various government affairs. In order to win the final victory of the war, it is most important to make the spirit of the whole nation clear and broad-minded. Therefore, the "Great Harmony and Unity" of the Yamato race is absolutely necessary. Only in this way can we achieve the most and increase our will to fight. It is necessary for the commander and the government to cooperate closely during wartime. Without the commander, there is no government. Therefore, when carrying out government affairs, we should clarify the direction of the commander and grasp the national policy.</p>
<h3>Prime Minister Explains Key Points of Administration</h3>
<p>The following is a record of the Q&amp;A with reporters: (Q) What is the fundamental policy for national administration in this decisive stage? (A) Enhancing the will to fight and increasing production are the conclusions of this discussion, which means combining both the spiritual and material aspects. We, the Japanese people, all deeply understand the will of God. Therefore, whenever the country is in trouble, we can all abandon our personal grievances and unite strongly. This is truly a good point of us Japanese people. However, when uniting strongly, we must first enhance the nation's clear and broad-minded spirit and increase our combat power in an atmosphere of harmony. This is the basis of the spirit. In terms of material aspects, we must ensure the minimum level of national life. At the same time, government officials and the people must cooperate to enhance the nation's spirit of harmony and eliminate the inertia of the past, so that we can thoroughly understand the foundation of the nation. This should not only be done in education, but also in social organizations such as the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, which is the best organization to achieve this goal. The concrete policy to ensure the national life is the production of goods. After the goal of increasing production is achieved, the harvest should be distributed appropriately. (Q) What is the specific method of command and national administration for the new cabinet? (A) Japan is now in a harsh state of war, so government affairs cannot but belong to the command. In other words, the command includes the form of national administration and the Bank of Japan. To promote government affairs, we must recognize this point. To achieve this goal, we must strengthen the existing Government-Command Liaison Conference and make it more substantial, so that the leadership of the war and the war and national administration are united. (Q) In order to cope with the world war situation, how will you promote diplomacy with the Soviet Union? (A) We will be good at diplomacy with Germany and the Soviet Union, and insist on the close and friendly alliance relationship as always, observe the war situation, and promote the completion of the war. This does not need to be said by me. We will be good at diplomacy, maintain the friendly relationship that has been maintained so far, and continue to eliminate all unpleasantness between the two sides, to prevent it from happening. As for neutral countries, we will also maintain friendly relations in both material and spiritual aspects from beginning to end. Especially for the countries and nations of Greater East Asia, we want to have a close relationship without any regrets.</p>
<h3>Promoting Good Neighborly Diplomacy, Realizing the Joint Declaration: Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Expresses His Aspirations</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – Japanese Foreign Minister and Minister of Greater East Asia Shigemitsu met with reporters at the Foreign Minister's official residence on the 23rd and made a statement on the new cabinet's foreign policy. The gist of his statement was: The new cabinet's foreign policy has been explained by the Prime Minister, and it will continue the past policy without any change. My continued appointment as Foreign Minister and Minister of Greater East Asia will move towards the direction. First, we will work closely with the Allied countries to complete the war, especially focusing on the cooperative relationship between Japan and Germany. Second, we will thoroughly implement the Empire's Greater East Asia policy, the Greater East Asia Declaration, and the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty to seek the liberation and reconstruction of East Asia. This is the international justice and the purpose of Japan's war. Third, Japan will promote good neighborly and friendly relations with neutral countries and neighboring countries. Therefore, this war is an unavoidable war for self-preservation and self-defense, and it was caused by the enemy's provocation, which led to the conflict. The purpose of the Japanese Empire is to distribute international justice to the world and establish good neighborly and friendly relations with all countries. The above points have been approved by the Diet and have been repeatedly declared to the world as our country's basic foreign policy. The new cabinet will continue to strongly promote it, and I am determined to work together with my colleagues in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Greater East Asia, both at home and abroad, to strictly implement it. The most important thing to do well in the Greater East Asia policy is to unite the hearts of the nations of Greater East Asia so that they can all exert their full strength to cooperate in the war. The collection of materials is also indispensable to the completion of the war. If the nations are united, the collection of materials must be carried out under the mutual interests and overall interests of the countries of Greater East Asia. As for foreign affairs, the Prime Minister and the Army and Navy Ministers have consulted thoroughly, and their opinions have been consistent. In the future, foreign policy will be integrated with the military and will be strongly promoted.</p>
<h3>Promoting the Traditional Spirit, Striving for the Final Victory: Sincere Instructions from the Army and Navy Ministers</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – Japanese Army Minister and General Sugiyama visited the Ministry of the Army for the first time on the morning of the 23rd. At 2:20 p.m., he gathered all the officers in the main hall of the Ministry and gave sincere instructions, expressing his determination to fight the decisive battle. After meeting with former Army Minister Tojo to hand over his duties at 11:00 a.m., he met with the press corps and made a statement as follows: The war situation has entered a critical stage. As the Army Minister, I feel a deep sense of responsibility. In addition to gratitude, I am also filled with fear. To overcome the current difficult situation, the military must be more strongly united, promote fighting spirit, and bravely advance. We must closely cooperate with the Navy to crush the enemy. Therefore, it is most important that 100 million people be united as one and move towards the path of certain victory. To achieve the belief of certain victory, I will not hesitate to sacrifice myself. In the future, I will only strive to overcome all obstacles to achieve the final victory.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – Japanese Navy Minister and Admiral Mitsumasa Yonai met with the Navy press corps for the first time at the Navy Minister's official residence at 10:00 p.m. on the 22nd, expressing the Japanese government's determination to complete the war. The gist of his statement was as follows: I firmly believe that the essence of war lies in victory. There is no other way but victory. The essence of war lies in resolutely doing what you believe in. I feel that the urgent task is to meet the needs of the soldiers on the front lines. If the front lines need 1,000 aircraft, they should be supplied accordingly. For example, in contracting work, you can withdraw if there is a shortage of materials, but this is not the case in war. Modern war is a total war, and total strength must be exerted by all. Those who are in charge of guidance should also lead by example and direct the work separately. Also, if you want to win a war, the key lies in people. Therefore, the whole nation must cooperate closely to exert the total strength war. Cooperation does not mean that one opinion blindly follows other opinions, but that the two sides should learn from each other in a certain process and each exert their firm beliefs. The fact that General Koiso and I were ordered to form a cabinet is the meaning of cooperation. In the future, I hope that both the government and the public will not hesitate to give advice to make up for the shortcomings. In order to complete the mission, we will always cooperate and do our best to serve the Emperor's wishes.</p>
<h3>Various Measures to Enhance Combat Power</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – The new Japanese Minister of Agriculture and Commerce Shimada, Minister of Munitions Fujiwara, and Minister of Finance Ishiwatari all met with the press corps after the appointment ceremony and made statements. The following is a separate record: Shimada said, "In this era, all plans and affairs must be centered on the war. If the people's food is really insufficient, I will definitely take various measures to procure it. Otherwise, there is no way to win the people's trust. It is a mistake to say that farmers lack patriotism because they are often dissatisfied due to compensation or delays in receiving grain payments. The officials in charge must be fully aware of their responsibilities and be vigilant. Therefore, in the future, we must start from the actual situation to review various policies on food and other matters." Minister of Munitions Fujiwara said, "This time, I am shouldering the important task of munitions production. I will only devote myself to my duties with my usual beliefs, without being extravagant, and strive to make munitions production reach the level of winning the war." Ishiwatari said, "With the new progress of the cabinet's policies, many things have to be re-created, but fiscal and financial matters will still follow their basic policies and will not change. The key point of financial issues is to avoid inflation, and we will definitely make more efforts in this regard in the future. In addition, it is also essential to enhance the strength of the material aspects to seek the smooth financing of munitions. In terms of funds, we must remove the obstacles to production and, on the one hand, seek the effectiveness of funds, but we must not be too demanding. Also, we must change the past policies on savings and promote new plans."</p>
<h3>Intelligence Work Becomes More Important</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – The new Director-General of the Japanese Information Bureau, Kakuji Takeo, met with the cabinet press corps after the first cabinet meeting of the new cabinet at 7:00 p.m. on the 22nd and expressed his aspirations as follows: "Under the current state of the war situation, ideological warfare is also becoming more important. Therefore, the cabinet will also decide on fundamental policies on policy theories. Based on this fundamental policy, we will use the functions of the Information Bureau to establish a system of officials. In the future, we will report the truth to the people as much as possible about the war situation and other matters in order to promote the rise of the whole nation."</p>
<h3>Formation of the New Allied Cabinet: Minister Lin Xuan Speaks</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – After the formation of the new Allied cabinet, we are welcomed by the government and the public. The Axis countries are also pleased.

At the same time, he clarified to the world that our country will work together with its Allied partners with the greatest determination and courage to advance towards the path of victory.</p>

<p>China Front (A) "Ground Operations": In order to fully ensure Hengyang, the enemy attempted to send troops from the 5th and 7th war zones to reinforce it. The Japanese army has surrounded it everywhere and is opening up a war of annihilation.

In addition, the Japanese army unit that moved north from the east side of the Guangdong-Hankou railway captured Lingshan, where the main force of the enemy's 153rd Division was entrenched, 130 kilometers north of Guangzhou on the 16th. From the evening of the 12th to the 17th, the unit's battle record was as follows: The enemy abandoned 2,351 bodies, captured 744 prisoners, and seized 12 cannons, 15 heavy machine guns, and 473 other guns.

<p>Burma Front (A) "Ground Operations": The enemy forces in the Imphal area are gradually increasing their strength. Relying on air supply, they are pursuing the Japanese army. Especially in the Bishenpur area, the enemy is becoming more active under the cover of artillery fire. The war results of the Japanese army in the Nujiang, Myitkyina, and Mongao areas from February to July 11 are as follows: The enemy left 39,880 bodies, captured 1,333 prisoners (excluding those who surrendered), destroyed 419 enemy tanks and armored vehicles, captured 20 cannons, captured 283 cannons, destroyed 110 cannons, and captured 5,530 heavy and light machine guns and other firearms. (B) "Air Force Operations": This area is now difficult to enter the rainy season, but enemy planes still take off from time to time. Especially the aerial combat on the front line is more intense. Since the start of the operation in February this year, the Japanese Air Force and ground units have inflicted the following damage to the enemy by mid-July: 609 enemy planes were shot down and destroyed, 24 gliders were destroyed, and 82 Japanese planes were damaged from self-destruction and did not return.</p>
<p>Central Pacific The naval units fighting on Saipan launched a final surprise attack on the enemy with all their strength on the morning of the 17th. It has now been determined that all members were killed in action by the 16th. Also, the men and women on the island all cooperated with the Japanese army from beginning to end. Those who could fight resolutely joined the battle and suffered the same fate as the Japanese army. Since the enemy's mobile unit appeared on the Mariana Sea on June 11, the battle results of the Japanese air force and naval units are as follows: Two aircraft carriers were sunk. One battleship. Three cruisers and destroyers. One unknown type. Seven transport ships. Over 863 enemy planes were shot down. Since landing on Saipan, the enemy mobile unit has been cruising off the coasts of Saipan, Tinian, and Omiya Islands, attacking the Japanese army's positions day after day. 200 enemy planes have been attacking Tinian Island and Omiya Island day after day. On the morning of July 21, the enemy began landing on Omiya Island. The Japanese army is currently fighting fiercely with them. Also, the enemy attacks Ya Island, Truk, and Saipan Island. Also, 3 enemy planes attacked Chichijima on the 19th, and 3 enemy planes attacked Chichijima on the 20th. Thus, the war on the Saipan front came to an end, and as a result, the enemy's combat power on the island and the Mariana Sea has been strengthened. Also, about 1,449 enemy planes attacked the Central Pacific region in mid-June. As a result, 897 were shot down and 40 were destroyed by the Japanese army.</p>

<h3>Financial, Industrial, and Commercial Market Conditions Stable Last Week</h3>
<p>Financial, industrial, and commercial market conditions in Shanghai last week remained stable. After a sharp rise, prices leveled off, and the spot silver market remained unchanged. The official market prices did not fluctuate. The money market tightened due to the urgent need for funds to purchase agricultural products locally. Interbank lending rates rose by 4.3%, but then eased as the Central Bank of China supplied funds for legitimate needs as much as possible, and the interbank lending rate returned to 4%. The stock market situation improved slightly as the authorities strictly monitored speculation and short selling disappeared. People are generally optimistic, and the prospects for enterprise development are promising. The prices of various food items have fallen due to the strictness of finance, especially the price of rice. The source of transportation is smooth, the limit for rice purchases has been relaxed to over ten dan, and there is news of restoring household rice, so people's food is becoming more stable, and the black market price of rice has fallen below the big mark. The panic is gradually diminishing.</p>
<h3>Examination of Rice and Grain Problems in Various Regions</h3>
<p>The price of rice in the interior has always been controlled by the price of rice in Shanghai. The situation after the publication of the new measures has only caused the prices of rice in Shanghai and the interior to rise sharply together. However, before the publication of the new measures, the price of rice in the interior was already rising sharply. For example, in Songjiang, the price increased by 90% in the ten days from the end of April to the beginning of May. Someone once told the reporter the truth as follows:</p>
<p>The Rice Control Association buys from farmers and rice merchants until the end of April. After that, they can buy freely at market prices. Therefore, everyone believes that as long as they have rice, they can sell it at a high price. Rice merchants also predict that market prices will rise sharply, so they will not release the rice they have hoarded and wait and see the situation. Therefore, since the end of April, the price has risen extremely sharply. In this sharp rise, there must be agitation from corrupt national capital in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The price of rice in the interior, which started to rise in this way, was stimulated by the disputes and unrest in Shanghai caused by the publication of new rice and grain measures. The price rose higher and higher, and also tended to stabilize as the rice situation in Shanghai gradually stabilized.</p>
<p>The difference between the price of rice in Shanghai and various regions is difficult to believe. The four regions that reporters visited are all within one or two hours by train from Shanghai, but the difference in rice price is as high as 4,000 yuan per dan. The abnormal situation of price differences in various regions due to different regions is originally a cancer in the system and is worrying. However, the difference of 4,000 yuan per dan between Shanghai and Songjiang, and between Shanghai and Suzhou, as mentioned above, is truly a spectacle under the decisive battle. Moreover, recently, the price of rationed rice in Shanghai is cheaper than the market price in rural areas. In comparison, the future of the rice and grain problem feels increasingly difficult.</p>
<p>How is the existence of the unbelievable price difference mentioned above created? The insufficient absolute amount of rice entering Shanghai is also one of the important reasons. However, the price fluctuations of one or two thousand yuan in Shanghai overnight cannot be said to be caused by the absolute amount. The amount of imports now is not reduced at all compared to before, and has even increased somewhat, but there is a phenomenon of soaring rice prices. The hoarding and speculation in cotton yarn, cotton cloth, gold, and stocks in the past is now concentrated in rice and grain, especially during this severe lean season?</p>
<p>Key Points of Anti-Hoarding Measures</p>
<p>Since April last year, we have loudly called for reducing speculation and hoarding. Although various measures have been adopted to achieve this, they are still rampant. Moreover, the people's hearts also believe that it is impossible to eliminate hoarding and speculation because there are no strong measures after the forced purchase of yarn and the shooting of corrupt elements. Among some enlightened people, there are also those who believe that measures to suppress hoarding violate economic laws. However, can a national war system really be established if all powerful means are not launched against such an abnormal situation rampant in front of 450 million people, not to mention the eyes of 1 billion East Asian people? For those who despise anti-hoarding measures, the reporter wants to tell them the reactions heard in Suzhou and Wuxi after the execution of Hou Dachun and Hu Zheng:</p>
<p>The handling of the execution of Hou Dachun and Hu Zheng gave the people of Jiangsu Province an unprecedented good impression. Even those who had never expressed goodwill towards the national government began to believe that the national government would improve in the future. The shock of the people seeing the photographs of the execution of the two was comparable to the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. The Japanese naturally cannot agree that the execution of Hou and Hu was more shocking than the Greater East Asia War, but because the latter is directly related to the lives of the Chinese people, the people's cheers are extremely profound. Prices also stabilized for a considerable period of time as a result of this incident. The key to grasping the people's hearts is not complex and distant theories and policies, but simple and decisive words that workers and farmers will raise their hands to support. Now, there are few who can see the purely economic reasons for the fact that the price of rice in the lean season fluctuates by two or three thousand yuan every day, and the execution of hoarders and corrupt elements is precisely one of the simplest and most decisive ones. In this new stage, it goes without saying that only this form is the only way to open up. However, no matter what measures or policies are implemented, they must be handled with unprecedented determination. (Translated from the June 28th Continental New Daily)</p>
