<h3>希望於中國新聞協會</h3>
<p>中國新聞協會今天正式成立，我們也是會員之一，所以，站在本位的立塲，不必致其客套的祝詞，願掬至誠，貢獻若干管見。　　去年一月間，上海新聞界各報社爲宣揚大東亞主義和中日兩國國策，研究新聞事業之發展及發揮其性能，達成新聞事業爲時代先驅的使命起見，共同發起組織上海新聞聯合會，當時我們指出，這是上海新聞界自動的組織，團結的新紀元，也是中國以至中日兩國新聞界自動團結的第一聲。我們在有了這共同組織以後，自然更團結在一起，爲政府良善的法令和國策，而盡宣揚的責任。同時，我們更希望兩國當局充分扶助新聞事業。因爲一個國家一方面必須有基礎健全的民營報紙，一方面政府加以合理的領導，只有扶助重於領導，領導重於統製；只有使扶助領導，與統制這當的兼籌並顧，方能發揮戰時新聞的效力。例如日本的朝日，每日，讀賣等均爲最完善的民營報紙，因爲戰前的日本政府能加以充分的扶助，戰後的日本政府能加以合理的統制，所以，今日才能使報紙發揮其宣揚國策，指導人民，和發揚戰時文化的偉大使命。若是所有報紙都成爲政府的喉舌，那末只要公文告示和命令就夠了，爲什麼還要報紙？正因爲政府必須經過報紙，採納輿論，接受民意，才能決定良善和萬全的政策。同時，也只有經過報紙，闡揚政策，指導人民，才能期待政策之貫澈。　　上海新聞聯合會成立，已經一年八個月了，我們當時所陳述的意思，對於今天成立的全國性的中國新聞協會，覺得仍有重復提供的意義。所以，我們不憚煩瑣複引如上。其次，我們希望中國新聞協會成立以後，督導新聞界發揮應有的使命之外，並應切切實實的辦理幾件事：　　第一，充分認識目前時局情勢。大東亞戰爭已屆最後決戰階段，生死存亡決於俄頃，今日新聞界的使命，應以宣揚和鼓勵一般人堅定必勝信念爲第一。　　第二，研究改進宣傳技術。宣傳技術的的優良與否，影響於宣傳戰的成敗，決戰愈近，敵人的宣傳攻勢亦愈烈，如何針對敵人的宣傳攻勢，予以反擊攻破，自須在技術上不斷求取進步，適應隨時隨地的環境。　　第三，目前新聞從業人員，尤其是內外勤記者人村，特別感覺缺乏，欲求事業與舉，培養人材實爲急要，應即注意於青年記者的訓練工作。　　第四，工欲善其事，必先利其器，新聞事業所必要的報紙及一切器材，均感貧乏，這是基本的缺點，無論如何，器材與用紙，應即妥善計劃，逐漸達到自給自足的目的。</p>
<h3>菲律濱東方海面日空軍收獲戰果敵航空母艦四艘中彈受創</h3>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　據西南太平洋電：日機隊二十二日晨於菲律賓東方海面，對敵有力機動隊作包勦攻擊，予以重創，此事業經發表。此後更判明詳細戰果如次：（Ａ）敵方損失，○大型航空母艦二艘中彈受創。○中型航空母艦一艘中彈，甲板上之飛機約二十架均起火焚毀。○中型航空母艦一艘遭逢掃射，有艦載機數架中彈燃燒。○巡洋艦一艘中彈受創。（Ｂ）日方損失，飛機五架未歸還。</p>
<h3>敵機襲馬尼刺被擊落十七架</h3>
<p>馬尼刺二十四日中央社電　敵二十二日以P61與P62型艦載機一百三十架，分三次襲擊馬尼刺地區，又以P65及P62型機五十架來襲庫拉克地區，分別向各該地之地上設施及港灣設施，加以轟炸。但敵空軍技術非常抽劣，故日方損害極微，僅有停於港灣內之小型船舶一艘被炸沉沒，一艘被炸受傷。反之，敵機則被日方擊落達十七架之多，計空戰擊落二架，地上砲火擊落十五架，是役日機亦有一架自炸。</p>
<h3>全東亞民族奮起擊滅敵殘暴武力菲國參戰後林部長發表談話</h3>
<p>中央社訊　菲律賓共和國於廿三日對美英宣戰後，林部長物在滬發表談話，大要如左：自從美國掠奪菲律賓之後，其始則以窮兇極惡之殘暴武力，歷迫菲律賓之革命運動，其後則以欺驅延宕之懷柔手段，軟化菲律賓之革命運動，今則又復肆其暴虐，以飛機大砲摧殘在大東亞戰事中方已獲得獨立自由之菲律賓共和國，從可在其所謂[世界安全原則]，[世界安全機構]，無非爲保障其厲行侵略之安全，而危害他民族獨立自由之安全，此種宰割世界歧視人種之妄念與暴行，一日不改變或遏目，則東亞之和平，世界之安定，將永久無確保之一日。吾人對於菲律賓共和國爲准持其獨立與領土，爲保障其人民生命財產，爲答復美國之侵略，毅然決然實行參戰，寄予無限之同情。即凡我東亞人民，茍稍具愛國家之一念者，對於美國空軍所至，濫施轟炸，對於美國陸軍所至，人無噍類，對於美國海軍所至，血滿江河，亦終必有奮起而抗爭之一日。如美國欲以所謂爲世界安全爲民主政治之招牌，掩飾其暴行，則吾人當反問彼受安全愛民主之美國人民，今果有何人以一槍一砲侵入美國本土，危及美國國家及人民之安全乎？彼貪婪嗜殺之軍火商，非日在吸吮美國勞動大衆之鮮血，爲其製造殺人工具之原料，復以之流他人之鮮血乎？彼以愛護民主保障安全自稱者，非日在假藉戰爭，剝削其人民之自由，葬送其國家之民主，且在此次大戰未了之頃，即已播下第三次大戰之惡種予？吾不問此槍此砲，其質量如何，然此槍此砲，由榨取自國人民之鮮血而成，爲流盡他國之鮮血而用，其必不足以敵人類求生存求共存之自衛力，而自取敗亡，可斷言也。</p>
<h3>日駐菲大使發表聲明</h3>
<p>馬尼刺二十四日中央社電　菲律賓共和國於二十三日正午發表參戰宣言後，日本駐菲大使杭田氏亦發表聲明如次：美國企圖制覇世界，永久制壓東亞民族，再度侵寇菲律賓，遂使菲律賓蹶起參戰。駐菲日軍基於日菲同盟條約之義務，巳聲明舉全力擔任防衛菲律賓之大任。大東亞各民族之戰爭目的，已明示於大東亞共同宣言，此次菲律賓之參戰，亦屬於完成五大原則之強力支柱。帝國與菲律賓共同作光榮之戰爭，援助其獨立，衷心期其興隆，迄今日軍依據同盟條約，保衛菲律賓，並在菲律賓官民之協力下，逐步完成防衛態勢，此均菲律賓官民過去努力之賜物，於茲謹申深切之感謝。時至今日，菲律賓全體國民由於此次參戰，將相與奮起一致團結，在菲總統洛勒爾之指揮下，發揮其傳統之精神，使菲律賓成爲東亞之偉大國家，此爲吾人所深信而無疑者。同時吾人更切盼果敢之菲律賓國民，爲擊滅共同敵人，充分發揚戰意，以與日本軍隊作更進一步之協力。</p>
<h3>京市實施節電</h3>
<p>南京二十四日中央社電　華中水電公司實施電流節約，二十二日起，派員赴京市各工廠調查電力電熱使用狀況，指示節電依法。中央憲兵司令陳　，曁首都警察總監李謳一，特發表談話，勗勉京市民衆勉力撙節電流，對大東亞戰爭貢獻一分之力量。</p>
<h3>鎭江見聞</h3>
<p>— 閔賢</p>
<p>鎭江爲通江北及京滬水陸交通要道，一下火車，即有一特色現於眼廉，蓋車站附近各茶館及各小飯館爲適應過路客人起見，多兼營旅館業務，記者出站僱一人力車至伯先路某旅社，以該處較爲適中。</p>
<h3>斯文乞丐各地皆然</h3>
<p>乃沿途追隨人力車求乞者，五人中竟有四人穿着長衫，記者爲好奇心所驅使，下車與最後一位相談，據稱原爲小學教員，並會充過家庭教師，年來生活飛漲，求業不易，經商不能，淪而出此，實非得已，並言類乎彼者甚多！並取出一二證明文件，絕非江湖者流，文人末路，一至於斯，記者略有贈與，僅表示同情而巳。此種情形，不僅鎭江如是，幾乎各地皆然，雖然百無一用是書生，終是智識份子，似有待於政府與社會相當救濟也。</p>
<h3>人口統計與物價一斑</h3>
<p>鎭江市面事變後恢復甚速，除燬於兵變之房屋，早巳建築復原外，其人口據鎭江縣第一模範區截至本年九月十日之最近調查，市區及附近各鄉鎭共有一六五三五八人，內男九零四一九人，女七四九三九人，比較事變前不相上下。　　鎭江商業中心區之大西路，依然商店櫛比，不減當年，不過五洋店舖林立，觸目皆是，今昔不同耳此種日用品之店舖畸形發達亦足以反映物價直綫高漲之道矣，最近物價，最上陳米每石四千八百元，最上新米每石約四千四百元，麥每石約二千餘元，食用油每斤一百三十元，豬肉每斤八十元，牛肉每斤七十六元，柴草每擔六百四五十元，白糖每斤二百八十元，赤糖每斤二百七十元，鎭江馳名遐邇之出產品醋，最高者每斤四十八元，其他日用品如毛巾牙粉等物，均較上海物價約諯地分之五十。</p>
<h3>教育情形逐漸改良</h3>
<p>鎭江教育素來相當發達，兵囊後現巳逐漸恢復奮觀，如中學除仍有一縣立完全中學外，並有私立中學五所，大多男女生兼敢，如女生較多之校，則另開女生班，小學則有六七十所，並有代用小學十四所。所謂代用小學即改良之私塾也，此種代用小學所採課程以實用爲主，如特別注重寫帳珠算習字寫信等事，來就學者多半不打算升學，純作就業之最低準備，以是代用小學之學生較其他小學爲多。記者會往石浮橋下新河街參觀一代用小學，校長兼教員係孫子壽君，學生七十餘人，學生一般程度似較普通小學爲高，問其家庭情形，大多薪水階級及工人之家，並都說出畢業後即找事做，現在生活日高，中上教育，非富家子弟不能享受，故此種學校應時而起，且來此種學校就學亦須繳納學費每學期千餘元，並非易事，不過爲期較短切於實用而已。鎭江縣立圖書館所藏普通書籍，相當豐富，爲他縣所不及也，民衆教育設備亦尚佳善。</p>
<h3>鄉邨社會的魚鱗爪</h3>
<p>鎭江人素來愛講塲面，無論上館子，進澡堂，或買物件，熟人多半記帳，三節付款，乃目前物價一日千里，若仍照舊例，出入太大，以是許多菜館店舖多貼有原諒付現字條，而以各該業同業公會出面。又鎭江各街市之戒烟所，仍有癮君子在那裹大戒其烟，較之首都實行對開者，似有遜色矣。又在上午上館子，若思飲酒，祇要拿出錢來呌堂倌用玻璃杯沽來，就算不建功令了。總而言之，中國人遇事總有辦法。記者白天須出外工作，晚上想寫點稿子，總是被間壁房間響導歇女覺得頭昏腦漲，早晨尚未起牀，又爲歌女吊嗓子所驚醒，恨記者缺乏鄭康成先生之鎭靜功夫，總覺不大舒服，此種糜爛生活，各地皆然，誰言中國現在戰時體制下哉。　　記者對於甘露鎭象山鄉京峴鄉虎踞鎭登鎭鎭牌灣鄉新河鎭等處鄉村，均已巡禮過，大多均種稻田，麥田甚少，稻田每畝約收三石上下，因此間土質不甚佳善，不過如是也。因農人多半兼有副業，如養家畜及小販等，生活尚不甚困苦，高利貸有不多見，惟政府於田賦即將實物征收，農民似乎又添一層焦慮，此事辦理伊始，難免種種困難，似有待於當局妥善處置預防一切可能之弊端也。　　記者到鎭江後，即發現各大街均縣有紅布標語，原來鎭江第一區區長已決定實行民選，現在辦理初選手續，果能認眞民選，未始不是革除土皇帝之前奏曲也。又記者會聞農人談及本年冬季須要掘焚稻根，淹沒水田，以除蝗害，聞係縣府所通令，勢在必行，此尚實事求是，似較僅在都市開會發議論爲高也。</p>
<h3>東亞各地日軍一週間戰況</h3>
<p>英印度洋艦隊司令易人　　東京二十四日中央社電　週間戰況如次：北太平洋　十四日十五日十八日三日間來襲敵機，約在二十架以上，擊毀其四架。中國方面　（陸戰）中國南部日軍繼續追擊敵軍，一路猛進，十四日佔領道縣，十四日攻取全縣，十八日突破道縣南方之江華，及全縣南方之京亭地區。向桂林急進，二十二日佔領梧州。（空戰）日機隊協力陸軍作戰，空襲西安·丹竹·柳州·贛州等敵空軍基地，於一日至二十一日間擊落擊毀來襲敵機達九十四架。緬甸方面　日軍對包圍龍陵之渝第十一集團八個師，開始猛攻，渝軍受重創後，向該地北方敗走，於是記陵包圍綱乃於九月十日完全突破。兩個月來斷絕連絡之該地日軍，刻獲得增援，正向該地雲南遠征軍猛加反攻。中太平洋　方面敵軍十五日在帛琉島培里琉登陸，十七日在安格維爾島登陸，且於墨爾加諸島之摩羅泰島登陸，顯係欲踏入菲律賓作戰之階段。此種登陸作戰之意義，在距菲律賓民那峨島約六百里之摩羅泰島建設陸上空軍基地，作爲對抗菲律賓日空軍兵力之一翼。誇稱擁有空母勢力百艘以上之敵軍艦隊，集合海空兩軍實力，向日軍有力之空軍基地作正面攻擊，敵軍避免長時間之作戰，此可證之最近復以小型機迭襲肥紹爾羣島之洞賻島。菲律賓方面二十一日敵有力機動部隊會以艦載機五百架，二度空襲馬尼刺周圍地區，但經日軍邀擊，損失頗重。南太平洋　東南太平洋方面自空軍決戰塲漸向西移，東南方面各基地來襲之敵機已漸趨減少，最近惟拉巴爾方面來襲之敵機相當增加，實係奇特現象。西南太平洋方面與帛琉吸摩羅泰島作戰後，敵機對菲律賓哈爾馬耶拉·西里伯·斯安波那阿拉夫拉海等各基地之奉制轟炸亦與日俱增，（B24）（B25）（P38）（P40）巨人等型艦載戰門機·以及陶格拉斯急降轟炸機大型飛艇等紛至沓來，此實新幾內亞沿岸敵陸上基地漸次西移之明徵，并可表示出敵有力機動部隊正以西加羅林爲中心，展開活動，對此，各處日軍於每次敵機來襲時，咸予以重創，而令敵空軍兵力喪失。印度洋方面　該方面雖無大規模行動，然英國印度洋艦隊長官之更迭，實堪注目。</p>
<h3>梧州城內大火延燒中美空軍轟炸汽油庫</h3>
<p>廣州二十四日中央社電　日華南精銳部隊，二十一日夜至二十二日黎明，突入梧州縣城，守備該縣渝軍，即先退走。在日軍突入前，駐渝美軍將市內曁油積重要設施炸毀，目前延燒中。</p>
<h3>烈燄蔽空景象淒慘</h3>
<p>華南前綫二十四日中央社電　日軍佔領後之梧州市，至今仍黑烟烈火蔽空，露呈淒慘景象。據當地民衆談稱，此乃駐渝美空軍於日軍入城前，二十一日上下午，兩度轟炸梧州市內美國所經營汽油公司之汽油倉庫，使其燃燒所致。美空軍此種虐殺民衆惡行，已見諸衡陽長沙，頗使該地民衆憤慨</p>
<h3>敵機夜襲武昌地區</h3>
<p>漢口二十四日中央社電　渝美空軍二十二日晚十時以後，三度以兩三架編隊，盲炸武昌地區後遁走，日陸上設施略有損失。</p>
<h3>南北鐵道可望貫通</h3>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　日軍接連展開河南湖南華南及浙江作戰後，渝軍漸次向內地退卻，因日軍紀律嚴整，新和平區城內之中國人民均漸漸明瞭中日協力及亞洲民族共榮之偉大理想。日軍正集中全力，從事建設鐵路，由以上四大戰綫之進展，浙贛綫·粵漢綫·京漢綫等實有貫通之可能性。蓋就華南湖南兩戰區而觀，渝第三戰區已與內地斷絕聯絡，故今後以杭州爲起點，經金華玉山·南昌至長沙之貫通浙贛路工作，實不難實現，而由漢口起經長沙·衡陽·韶關至廣州之貫通粵漢綫工作，亦屬易舉。最後就貫通京漢綫而觀，北京新鄉間之北段成爲和平地區，對增強民衆福利貢獻顯大。自過去河南作戰起，日軍一過黃河時，鐵路隊即完成架橋工事，繼更積極敷設由黃河南岸至鄭州間之路綫將其完成，又由鄭州經信陽連結漢口之路綫，亦自五月以來即開始建設。故爲中國交通重脈之京漢綫，較前更趨健全，不久即可完成其安定中國民生，及強化中國南北交通之使命。如鐵道路綫逐項完成時，不但加強對渝方及駐渝美軍之壓力·且於日軍作戰上亦有重大之意義</p>
<h3>帛琉島日軍繼續奮戰中</h3>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　帛琉方面二十二日戰況：○培里琉島日軍依然確保飛機塲高地及該島南端陣地，予敵損失甚大。敵軍之砲擊至廿二日已漸微弱，料係砲彈不足所致。敵軍自登陸一週以來，因遭日軍晝信猛襲，已極疲勞，故攻勢亦極消極，似待精銳部隊增援中，廿二日下午敵軍會砲擊日軍陣地，企圖掩護步兵進攻，旋被日軍阻止，當晚日軍更以肉彈果敢突入敵陣與敵以重創。自十六至廿二日止八日間日軍所獲戰果，計敵遺屍處達五千餘具，擊毀戰車百二十餘輛，破壞火砲十數門，擊沉掃海艦一艘，炸沉潛艇一艘，擊毀大型運輸船三艘，並擊沉五十噸級登陸用舟艇一艘，擊毀二艘，此外並於敵軍登陸之當日，即十五日擊沉滿載敵兵之登陸用舟艇六十餘艘。○安格維爾島日軍自敵國登陸以來，六日間激戰結果，雖受害頗大，但至今仍以寡兵於敵軍砲擊下繼續果敢作戰中，廿一日夜敵軍會於該島各地集中投下照明彈，日軍正於全綫突入敵陣，實行肉彈攻擊，致使敵蒙受重創。</p>
<h3>日本芬蘭斷絕邦交</h3>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　日駐芬公使昌谷，二十二日下午二時半應芬外長之邀，訪問芬外部，芬外交次長代理外長手交外長加名之日斷絕國交文書，昌谷公使於二十三日電呈本國外務省。日松本外務次官，於二十四日下午十時招請芬蘭駐日公使至外務省，通告照樣斷絕國交。茲誌芬對日斷交文書內容如次：[芬政府鑒電呈本國外務省。日松本外務次官，於二十四日下午十時招請芬蘭駐日公使至外務省，通告照樣斷絕國交。茲誌芬對日斷交文書內容如次：[芬政府鑒於目下事態，與日本斷絕外交關係，大日本駐芬公使及館員即當撤退，同時滯芬之日本國民亦當於最近期內回國]。</p>
<h3>史末資赴開羅迎接英要人</h3>
<p>瑞典京城二十四日是中央社電　海通社訊：卡爾杜姆消息：南非總理史末資將軍親自前往開羅，迎接英國貴賓二人赴開浦鎭，倫敦人士以爲史末資作五千英里之旅行，親自迎接之人物，當係高級長官，反軸心國政治家將在南非開會。</p>
<h3>義北反軸心軍進抵平原門戶</h3>
<p>柏林二十四日中央社電　海通社訊：亞得里亞海岸之反軸心軍，已抵義國北部平原之門戶利米尼，反軸心軍必須通過　平寗山與礁湖區域間四五十公里之窄狹地帶，始能到達波倫亞，然後進攻波河流域。</p>
<h3>波海區德軍退出勒佛爾</h3>
<p>柏林二十四日中央社電　海通社訊：德軍退出愛沙尼亞京城勒佛爾，並於撤退前，炸毀軍事建築物，破壞海港。德軍由海道運輸，蘇軍未能作有效之擾亂。波羅的海區域之決戰，在華爾克一帶，蘇軍集中進攻發生劇戰，德軍反攻，已將缺口塡平</p>
<h3>荷蘭境內德軍抵抗力增強亞琛區敵東進被遏阻</h3>
<p>柏林二十四日中央社電　海通社訊，德國軍事發言人稱：西綫戰事焦點在荷蘭，目前正猛攻安亨與尼美根之反軸心軍空輸部隊，敵軍對於空輪部隊之成敗，已發生懷疑矣。德軍已俘獲空輸部隊四，二○○人。亞琛區域反軸心軍運用鉅量之物力與人力，企圖突破史托爾堡一帶，但未獲逞。反軸心軍企圖於九月突破內綫，目前尚無決定之戰果，而德軍之抵抗益趨堅強，且已建立防綫。</p>
<h3>魯納維爾坦克大戰</h3>
<p>柏林二十四日中央社電　海通社訊：二十四小時內，魯納維爾區內展開德美坦克車大戰，美軍入魯納維爾城後，德軍抗戰甚烈，敵蒙重損，又調來生力軍向魯納維爾兩邊進攻，企圖奪佔城東之地，並施放烟幕彈掩護軍事行動，於是德美坦克車相撞，美軍輛雖多，仍被德軍擊毀多輛。</p>

<h3>華中水電公司調整節電辦法</h3>

        <h1>1944 - n265</h1>
<h3>Hope for the China News Association</h3>
<p>The China News Association is formally established today, and we are also one of its members. Therefore, standing from our own position, we need not offer formal congratulatory remarks. We wish to offer our utmost sincerity and contribute some of our humble views.</p>
<p>Last January, various newspaper publishers in Shanghai, in order to promote Greater East Asianism and the national policies of China and Japan, to study the development of the news industry, and to fulfill its mission as a pioneer of the times, jointly initiated the organization of the Shanghai News Federation. At that time, we pointed out that this was an autonomous organization of the Shanghai news industry, a new era of unity, and the first voice of autonomous unity for the news industries of China and even China and Japan. After having this common organization, we naturally became more united, fulfilling our responsibility to promote the government's sound laws and national policies. At the same time, we also hope that the authorities of both countries will fully support the news industry. Because a country must have fundamentally sound private newspapers on one hand, and the government must provide reasonable leadership on the other. Only with support being more important than leadership, and leadership being more important than control; only by comprehensively considering and addressing support, leadership, and control appropriately, can the effectiveness of wartime news be brought into full play. For example, Japan's Asahi, Mainichi, and Yomiuri are all the most complete private newspapers, because the pre-war Japanese government was able to provide full support, and the post-war Japanese government was able to apply reasonable control. Therefore, today, newspapers can fulfill their great mission of promoting national policy, guiding the people, and developing wartime culture. If all newspapers become government mouthpieces, then official announcements and orders would be sufficient. Why would we need newspapers? It is precisely because the government must go through newspapers, adopt public opinion, and accept the will of the people in order to determine sound and comprehensive policies. At the same time, only by going through newspapers to explain policies and guide the people can we expect the policies to be implemented thoroughly.</p>
<p>The Shanghai News Federation has been established for one year and eight months. The meaning we stated at that time still has significance for repeated presentation to the national China News Association established today. Therefore, we do not hesitate to repeat the above in detail. Secondly, we hope that after the China News Association is established, in addition to supervising the news industry to fulfill its due mission, it should also handle the following matters practically:</p>
<p>First, fully recognize the current situation. The Greater East Asia War has reached the final decisive stage, and life and death are determined in an instant. The mission of the news industry today should be to promote and encourage a firm belief in victory among the general public as its primary goal.</p>
<p>Second, study and improve propaganda techniques. The quality of propaganda techniques affects the success or failure of the propaganda war. As the final battle draws nearer, the enemy's propaganda offensive becomes more intense. How to counter and break through the enemy's propaganda offensive requires continuous improvement in technology and adaptation to the ever-changing environment.</p>
<p>Third, there is currently a particular shortage of news practitioners, especially reporters both in and out of the field. To seek career advancement, cultivating talent is essential. Attention should be paid to the training of young reporters immediately.</p>
<p>Fourth, a craftsman must first sharpen his tools to do his job well. Newspapers and all the necessary equipment for the news industry are scarce. This is a fundamental shortcoming. In any case, equipment and paper should be properly planned immediately and gradually achieve self-sufficiency.</p>
<h3>Japanese Air Force Achieves War Results in the Eastern Sea of the Philippines, Four Enemy Aircraft Carriers Hit and Damaged</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to reports from the Southwest Pacific: On the morning of the 22nd, Japanese aircraft squadrons launched a mop-up attack on powerful enemy mobile units in the eastern sea of the Philippines, inflicting heavy damage. This operation has been announced. Further clarification of the detailed war results are as follows: (A) Enemy losses: ○ Two large aircraft carriers hit and damaged. ○ One medium-sized aircraft carrier hit, with about 20 aircraft on deck catching fire and being destroyed. ○ One medium-sized aircraft carrier strafed, with several carrier-based aircraft hit and burning. ○ One cruiser hit and damaged. (B) Japanese losses: Five aircraft did not return.</p>
<h3>Seventeen Enemy Aircraft Shot Down in Attack on Manila</h3>
<p>Manila, 24th (Central News Agency) - On the 22nd, the enemy used 130 P61 and P62 carrier-based aircraft in three waves to attack the Manila area, and 50 P65 and P62 aircraft to attack the Kurak area, bombing ground and port facilities in the respective areas. However, the enemy air force's technology was extremely poor, so Japanese damage was minimal, with only one small ship sunk and one damaged in the harbor. Conversely, the Japanese shot down as many as 17 enemy aircraft, including two shot down in air combat and 15 shot down by ground fire. One Japanese aircraft self-destructed in the operation.</p>
<h3>All East Asian Peoples Rise Up to Destroy Enemy Brutal Force, Minister Lin Issues Statement After Philippine Participation</h3>
<p>Central News Agency News - After the Republic of the Philippines declared war on the United States and Britain on the 23rd, Minister Lin issued a statement in Shanghai, the main points of which are as follows: Since the United States plundered the Philippines, it first used extremely brutal force to suppress the Philippine revolutionary movement, then used deceptive and delaying appeasement tactics to soften the Philippine revolutionary movement, and now it has resumed its tyranny, using aircraft and artillery to destroy the Republic of the Philippines, which had already gained independence and freedom in the Greater East Asia War. It can be seen that its so-called "world security principles" and "world security mechanism" are nothing more than ensuring the security of its aggression and endangering the security of the independence and freedom of other nations. If this kind of delusion and violence of dividing the world and discriminating against races is not changed or curbed one day, then the peace of East Asia and the stability of the world will never be ensured. We express our infinite sympathy for the Republic of the Philippines' resolute decision to participate in the war to maintain its independence and territory, to protect the lives and property of its people, and to respond to the aggression of the United States. All of us East Asian people, if we have even a slight sense of love for our country, will eventually rise up and resist the indiscriminate bombing by the US Air Force, the massacre by the US Army, and the blood-filled rivers caused by the US Navy. If the United States wants to use the banner of so-called world security and democracy to cover up its brutality, then we should ask the American people who enjoy security and love democracy, who is invading American soil with a gun and a cannon, endangering the safety of the American country and people? Are not the greedy and bloodthirsty arms dealers sucking the blood of the American working masses every day, using it as raw materials for manufacturing killing tools, and then using it to shed the blood of others? Are not those who claim to love democracy and protect security exploiting the freedom of their people and burying the democracy of their country in the name of war, and sowing the seeds of a third world war before the current war is over? I do not ask how good the quality of these guns and cannons is, but these guns and cannons, made from the blood of their own people and used to shed the blood of other countries, will surely not be able to resist the self-defense power of mankind seeking survival and coexistence, and will bring about their own defeat.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ambassador to the Philippines Issues Statement</h3>
<p>Manila, 24th (Central News Agency) - After the Republic of the Philippines issued a declaration of war at noon on the 23rd, the Japanese Ambassador to the Philippines, Mr. Hangtian, also issued a statement as follows: The United States attempted to dominate the world and permanently suppress the East Asian nations, and once again invaded the Philippines, which led the Philippines to rise up and participate in the war. Based on the obligations of the Japan-Philippines Alliance Treaty, the Japanese army stationed in the Philippines has declared that it will do its utmost to take on the important task of defending the Philippines. The war aims of the East Asian nations have been clearly stated in the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. The participation of the Philippines in this war is also a strong pillar for the completion of the five major principles. The Empire and the Philippines will jointly wage a glorious war, assist in its independence, and sincerely hope for its prosperity. To this day, the Japanese army has been protecting the Philippines based on the alliance treaty, and with the cooperation of the Philippine officials and people, has gradually completed the defense posture. This is all thanks to the past efforts of the Philippine officials and people. Hereby, I express my deep gratitude. As of today, all the people of the Philippines, due to this participation in the war, will rise up together in unity, and under the command of President Laurel of the Philippines, will display their traditional spirit and make the Philippines a great country in East Asia. This is what we deeply believe and have no doubt about. At the same time, we also sincerely hope that the brave Philippine people will fully promote their fighting spirit in order to destroy the common enemy and cooperate further with the Japanese army.</p>
<h3>Electricity Conservation Implemented in Nanjing</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency) - Huazhong Water and Electricity Company implemented electricity conservation. Starting on the 22nd, it sent personnel to factories in Nanjing to investigate the use of electrical power and heat, and to instruct on electricity conservation in accordance with the law. Central Military Police Commander Chen, and Capital Police Chief Inspector Li Ouyi, issued statements, encouraging the people of Nanjing to make every effort to conserve electricity and contribute to the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<h3>Observations in Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>— Min Xian</p>
<p>Zhenjiang is a key transportation route for water and land between northern Jiangsu and Shanghai-Nanjing. Upon exiting the train station, a distinctive feature immediately catches the eye: the tea houses and small restaurants near the station mostly offer lodging services to accommodate passing travelers. I hired a rickshaw to a hotel on Boxian Road, as it seemed a suitable location.</p>
<h3>Begging Scholars Common Everywhere</h3>
<p>Along the way, five beggars followed the rickshaw, four of whom were wearing long gowns. Driven by curiosity, I got off the rickshaw and spoke with the last one. He claimed to be a former elementary school teacher and tutor. In recent years, with soaring living costs and difficulty finding employment or starting a business, he had no choice but to resort to begging, stating that many others were in similar situations. He even produced some identification documents, proving he was not a mere vagabond. The plight of scholars had reached such a state. I offered some assistance, expressing only my sympathy. This situation is not unique to Zhenjiang, but common almost everywhere. Though scholars may be useless in many ways, they are still intellectuals and seem to require significant relief from the government and society.</p>
<h3>Population Statistics and Price Indicators</h3>
<p>Zhenjiang's urban area has recovered quickly after the incident. The houses destroyed in the mutiny have long been rebuilt. According to the latest survey conducted by the First Model District of Zhenjiang County as of September 10th of this year, the urban area and surrounding towns have a total population of 165,358, with 90,419 males and 74,939 females, roughly the same as before the incident. Daxi Road, the commercial center of Zhenjiang, still has rows of shops, not as busy as it used to be. However, stores selling foreign goods are now everywhere, a stark contrast to the past. The abnormal development of these stores selling daily necessities also reflects the sharp rise in prices. Recent prices include: top-quality aged rice at 4,800 yuan per stone, top-quality new rice at about 4,400 yuan per stone, wheat at about 2,000 yuan per stone, cooking oil at 130 yuan per catty, pork at 80 yuan per catty, beef at 76 yuan per catty, firewood at 645 yuan per load, white sugar at 280 yuan per catty, and brown sugar at 270 yuan per catty. Zhenjiang's renowned vinegar sells for up to 48 yuan per catty. Other daily necessities such as towels and toothpaste are about 50% cheaper than in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Education Gradually Improving</h3>
<p>Education in Zhenjiang has always been relatively developed, and is now gradually recovering after the chaos of war. In addition to the existing county-run full secondary school, there are also five private secondary schools, mostly co-educational. Schools with more female students have separate classes for girls. There are also sixty to seventy elementary schools and fourteen substitute elementary schools. These substitute elementary schools are improved private schools. The curriculum in these substitute elementary schools focuses on practical skills, such as bookkeeping, abacus, writing, and letter writing. Most students here do not plan to continue their education, but rather to prepare for immediate employment. As a result, these substitute elementary schools have more students than regular elementary schools. I visited a substitute elementary school on Xinhe Street under Shifu Bridge. The principal and teacher is Mr. Sun Zishou, with over seventy students. The general level of students seems to be higher than that of ordinary elementary schools. When asked about their family situations, most came from salaried and working-class families, and all said they would look for work after graduation. With the rising cost of living, middle and upper-level education is only accessible to wealthy families, so these schools have emerged in response to the times. Tuition is still required at over a thousand yuan per semester, making it not easy, but the duration is shorter and more practical. Zhenjiang County Library has a rich collection of general books, unmatched by other counties. Public education facilities are also relatively good.</p>
<h3>Glimpses of Rural Society</h3>
<p>Zhenjiang people have always valued appearances. Whether going to restaurants, bathhouses, or buying goods, acquaintances often settle accounts on credit, payable on the three major holidays. However, with prices rising rapidly, adhering to the old practices would lead to significant discrepancies. Therefore, many restaurants and shops have posted signs requesting payment in cash, with the endorsement of the industry association. The opium dens in Zhenjiang's streets still have addicts trying to quit, which is less impressive compared to the capital's open approach. Also, when eating at a restaurant in the morning, one can simply offer money and have the waiter fetch wine in a glass, bypassing formal drinking rituals. In short, the Chinese always find a way. I need to work during the day and want to write at night, but the noisy sounds of prostitutes from the neighboring rooms give me a headache. Before I get out of bed in the morning, I am awakened by singers practicing their vocals. I envy Mr. Zheng Kangcheng's calmness and feel uncomfortable. Such decadent living is common everywhere. Who can say that China is currently under a wartime regime? I have visited the villages of Ganlu Town, Xiangshan Township, Jingxian Township, Huju Town, Deng Town, Paiwan Township, and Xinhe Town. Most of them grow rice paddies, with few wheat fields. Each mu (unit of land) of rice paddy yields about three stone, which is only possible because the soil quality is not very good. However, because most farmers also have side occupations, such as raising livestock and petty trading, their lives are not too difficult. High-interest loans are rarely seen, but with the government about to implement the collection of land taxes in kind, farmers seem to be facing another layer of anxiety. As this matter is just beginning, there are bound to be various difficulties, and it seems necessary for the authorities to properly address and prevent all possible malpractices. After arriving in Zhenjiang, I noticed red banners on the main streets. It turns out that the chief of the First District of Zhenjiang has decided to implement popular elections and is currently carrying out the preliminary procedures. If a genuine popular election can be held, it may be the prelude to abolishing local despots. I also heard farmers talking about the need to dig up and burn rice roots and flood rice paddies this winter to eliminate locusts, as ordered by the county government. This seems to be based on practical realities, which is better than just holding meetings and making discussions in the city.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army's War Situation in East Asia for One Week</h3>
<p>British Indian Ocean Fleet Commander Replaced</p>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) - The weekly war situation is as follows: North Pacific - Enemy aircraft attacked on the 14th, 15th, and 18th for three days, with over twenty aircraft each time, destroying four of them. China Front - (Land Battle) The Japanese army in southern China continues to pursue the enemy, advancing rapidly. On the 14th, they occupied Daoxian, and on the 14th they captured the entire county. On the 18th, they broke through Jianghua, south of Daoxian, and the Jingting area, south of the county. They are rapidly advancing towards Guilin and occupied Wuzhou on the 22nd. (Air Battle) Japanese aircraft squadrons cooperated with the army in combat, attacking enemy air force bases in Xi'an, Danzhu, Liuzhou, and Ganzhou. From the 1st to the 21st, they shot down and destroyed 94 enemy aircraft. Burma Front - The Japanese army launched a fierce attack on eight divisions of the Chongqing 11th Group Army surrounding Longling. After suffering heavy casualties, the Chongqing army retreated north of the area, and the Longling siege line was completely broken on September 10th. The Japanese army in the area, which had been cut off from communication for two months, has now received reinforcements and is fiercely counterattacking the Yunnan Expeditionary Force in the area. Central Pacific - The enemy forces landed on Peleliu Island in Palau on the 15th, landed on Angaur Island on the 17th, and also landed on Morotai Island in the Moluccas Islands, apparently intending to enter the Philippines for combat. The significance of this landing operation lies in building a land air base on Morotai Island, about 600 miles from Mindanao Island in the Philippines, as one wing to counter the Japanese air force in the Philippines. The enemy fleet, boasting more than 100 aircraft carrier forces, gathered the strength of both the sea and air forces to launch a frontal attack on the powerful Japanese air force base. The enemy avoided prolonged operations, as evidenced by the recent repeated attacks on Dongbi Island in the Feysaul Islands with small aircraft. Philippine Front - On the 21st, enemy powerful mobile units used 500 carrier-based aircraft to bomb the surrounding areas of Manila for the second time, but suffered heavy losses after being intercepted by the Japanese army. South Pacific - The Southeast Pacific area has gradually shifted west from the air force decisive battle field. The enemy aircraft attacking various bases in the southeast have gradually decreased. Recently, the enemy aircraft attacking Rabaul have increased significantly, which is a peculiar phenomenon. Southwest Pacific - After the battles on Palau and Morotai Islands, the enemy aircraft's bombing of various bases in the Philippines, Halmahera, Celebes, Ambon, and the Arafura Sea has also increased daily. (B24), (B25), (P38), (P40) giant and other types of carrier-based fighter planes and Douglas dive bombers and large airships have arrived one after another. This is a clear sign that the enemy's land bases along the coast of New Guinea are gradually shifting westward, and it can also indicate that the enemy's powerful mobile units are deploying operations centered on the West Carolines. In response, the Japanese army at various locations inflicted heavy damage each time enemy aircraft attacked, causing the enemy air force to lose its strength. Indian Ocean - Although there were no large-scale operations in the area, the change of commander of the British Indian Ocean Fleet is noteworthy.</p>
<h3>Fire in Wuzhou City Spreads, US-China Air Force Bombs Gasoline Depot</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 24th (Central News Agency) - The elite troops of the Japanese South China Army suddenly entered Wuzhou County on the night of the 21st to the dawn of the 22nd, and the Chongqing army guarding the county retreated first. Before the Japanese army entered, the US military stationed in Chongqing destroyed important facilities including the gasoline depot in the city, and it is currently burning.</p>
<h3>Flames Fill the Sky, A Tragic Sight</h3>
<p>South China Front, 24th (Central News Agency) - Wuzhou City, after being occupied by the Japanese army, is still covered in black smoke and flames, revealing a tragic sight. According to local residents, this was caused by the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing bombing the gasoline depot of the gasoline company operated by the United States in Wuzhou City twice in the morning and afternoon of the 21st before the Japanese army entered the city, causing it to burn. This kind of atrocity of massacring the people by the US Air Force has been seen in Hengyang and Changsha, which has aroused the indignation of the local people.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Night Attack on Wuchang Area</h3>
<p>Hankou, 24th (Central News Agency) - After 10 PM on the 22nd, the Chongqing-US Air Force made three blind bombing raids on the Wuchang area in formations of two or three aircraft and then fled. The Japanese land facilities suffered slight damage.</p>
<h3>North-South Railways Expected to Be Connected</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) - After the Japanese army launched successive operations in Henan, Hunan, South China, and Zhejiang, the Chongqing army gradually retreated inland. Because the Japanese army is strictly disciplined, the Chinese people in the new peaceful areas have gradually understood the great ideals of Sino-Japanese cooperation and the co-prosperity of Asian nations. The Japanese army is concentrating its efforts on building railways. From the progress of the above four major battle lines, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Line, the Guangdong-Hankou Line, and the Beijing-Hankou Line are likely to be connected. Judging from the Hunan and South China war zones, Chongqing's Third War Zone has been cut off from contact with the inland. Therefore, it is not difficult to realize the work of connecting the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Road starting from Hangzhou, passing through Jinhua Yushan, Nanchang to Changsha. It is also easy to connect the Guangdong-Hankou Line from Hankou via Changsha, Hengyang, Shaoguan to Guangzhou. Finally, judging from the connection of the Beijing-Hankou Line, the northern section between Beijing and Xinxiang has become a peaceful area, making a significant contribution to enhancing the welfare of the people. Since the past Henan operation, when the Japanese army crossed the Yellow River, the railway team completed the bridge construction, and then actively laid the route between the south bank of the Yellow River and Zhengzhou and completed it. The route from Zhengzhou to Hankou via Xinyang has also been under construction since May. Therefore, the Beijing-Hankou Line, the main artery of China's transportation, is more sound than before, and will soon complete its mission of stabilizing China's livelihood and strengthening China's north-south transportation. When the railway routes are completed one by one, it will not only increase the pressure on Chongqing and the US military stationed in Chongqing, but also have significant implications for the Japanese army's operations.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army in Palau Islands Continues to Fight Valiantly</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) - War situation in the Palau area on the 22nd: ○ The Japanese army on Peleliu Island still secures the airfield highlands and the southern end of the island, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. The enemy's artillery fire had gradually weakened by the 22nd, presumably due to insufficient shells. Since the enemy landed a week ago, they have been extremely tired due to the Japanese army's fierce attacks during the day and night, so the offensive is also very passive, and it seems that they are waiting for reinforcements from elite troops. On the afternoon of the 22nd, the enemy shelled the Japanese army's position in an attempt to cover the infantry's attack, but was stopped by the Japanese army. That night, the Japanese army boldly broke into the enemy's position with human bombs and inflicted heavy damage on the enemy. From the 16th to the 22nd, the Japanese army achieved the following results in eight days: the enemy left over 5,000 corpses, destroyed over 120 tanks, damaged more than a dozen artillery pieces, sank one minesweeper, sank one submarine, destroyed three large transport ships, and sank one 50-ton landing craft, destroying two. In addition, on the day of the enemy's landing, the 15th, they sank more than 60 landing craft full of enemy soldiers. ○ The Japanese army on Angaur Island has been fighting fiercely for six days since the enemy landed. Although they have suffered considerable damage, they are still bravely fighting with a small number of soldiers under the enemy's artillery fire. On the night of the 21st, the enemy concentrated on dropping flares in various parts of the island. The Japanese army is breaking into the enemy's position along the entire line, carrying out human bomb attacks, causing the enemy to suffer heavy losses.</p>
<h3>Japan and Finland Sever Diplomatic Relations</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Minister to Finland, Masaya, visited the Finnish Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 2:30 PM on the 22nd at the invitation of the Finnish Foreign Minister.

<h3>German Resistance Strengthens in the Netherlands, Enemy Advance Eastward in Aachen Area Checked</h3>
<p>Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency telegram) - Haishen News Agency: A German military spokesman stated that the focus of the Western Front is in the Netherlands, where they are currently fiercely attacking the anti-Axis airborne troops in Arnhem and Nijmegen. The enemy is already doubtful about the success or failure of the airborne troops. The German army has captured 4,200 airborne troops. In the Aachen area, the anti-Axis forces used a large amount of material and manpower in an attempt to break through the Stolberg area, but were unsuccessful. The anti-Axis forces attempted to break through the inner line in September, but there are still no decisive results, and German resistance is becoming stronger and stronger, and defenses have been established.</p>
<h3>Tank Battle in Lunéville</h3>
<p>Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency telegram) - Haishen News Agency: Within 24 hours, a large-scale tank battle between German and American forces unfolded in the Lunéville area. After the American army entered the city of Lunéville, the German army resisted fiercely, causing heavy losses to the enemy. They also deployed reinforcements to attack on both sides of Lunéville, attempting to seize the eastern part of the city, and released smoke screens to cover their military operations. As a result, German and American tanks clashed. Although the American army had more vehicles, many were still destroyed by the German army.</p>

<h3>China Hydropower Company Adjusts Electricity Saving Measures</h3>
<p>Electricity Light Surveys Have Begun</p>
<p>Regarding wartime electricity conservation, the China Hydropower Company has adopted extraordinary measures since December of last year. Recently, due to the large-scale production of military supplies, it is necessary to further strengthen electricity conservation. It is estimated that military demand accounts for 60% of electricity consumption, while civilian demand accounts for 40%. The Shanghai headquarters of the company has now begun surveying electric lights, determining electricity consumption based on the building, number of residents, and number of rooms. The supply of electric heating will be suspended in consideration of the use of gas. In Nanjing, efforts to rationalize electricity consumption will soon begin.</p>
<h3>Police Bureau Cracks Down on Opium Dens</h3>
<p>The city police bureau recently cracked down on three opium dens at 54 Changchun Lane, Changan Road, Zhabei, No. 22, and 50 Changchun Road, and arrested a total of thirty-six drug addicts, seizing a large number of opium-smoking paraphernalia, which were all confiscated. In accordance with anti-drug laws, no bail is allowed. After the investigation is completed, they will be handed over to the district prosecutor's office for strict legal action. Citizens are encouraged to assist in reporting and arresting offenders at any time.</p>
<h3>Quality of Rationed Coal Briquettes Needs Improvement</h3>
<p>Regarding the quality of rationed coal briquettes, residents throughout the city have expressed dissatisfaction. The coal briquettes sold by various retailers repeatedly contain 40-50% coal dust. However, whether this responsibility lies with the factory or the retailer needs to be thoroughly investigated by the authorities, as the coal briquettes shipped out by the factory each time also contain a large amount of coal dust.</p>
<h3>Factory Management Matters Handled by Two Bureaus</h3>
<p>The inspection of factories and the issuance of licenses in the city have been transferred to the Boiler Section of the Second Division of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau for continued handling since August 1st of this year. Other matters relating to factories are handled by the Review Section and the Factory Section of the Fourth Division of the Municipal Public Works Bureau. Factories in the urban area that have not yet obtained licenses should apply to the Second Division of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau on Changning Road and Room 346 and 350 of the Third and Fourth Divisions of the Municipal Public Works Bureau at 180 Fuzhou Road, starting immediately.</p>
<h3>Materials Allocation Office Promotes New Measurement System</h3>
<p>The national standard of weights and measures has long been unified and implemented. In the new system of weights and measures, the use or adoption of the old system is prohibited. Recently, the city's Materials Allocation Office noted that stores selling rationed goods often still use illegal British and American pound names, which is inconsistent with the law. It is necessary to find ways to change to the use of [city jin] or [kilogram] as the unit. Yesterday, relevant branches of each Jin institute were assigned to draft reform measures for approval.</p>
<h3>Health Commissioner Lu Inspects Smoking Cessation Hospital</h3>
<p>Health Commissioner Lu visited the Shanghai Smoking Cessation Hospital under his jurisdiction on the morning of the 24th to understand the recent situation of the hospital. He spent more than an hour inspecting the internal wards, patient rooms, and medical and health facilities, and was quite satisfied. He also spoke with patients undergoing smoking cessation treatment, inquiring about their current condition and the treatment process. According to the director of the hospital, all those who have undergone smoking cessation treatment at the hospital will be issued a smoking cessation certificate upon discharge. One month later, after the hospital's review, those who have confirmed that they have quit or abstained from the habit can submit the certificate to the Health Department for the issuance of a certificate of abstinence.</p>

<h3>Store Awnings Must Be Removed Within a Month</h3>
<p>As the weather has become cooler, the permits for shops, residences and factories to erect awnings that were approved by the authorities will expire at the end of this month. It is reported that in order to prevent fires and ensure public safety, the authorities have issued a notice to all businesses to dismantle them voluntarily before the end of this month, otherwise personnel will be sent to forcibly dismantle them. These types of awnings are particularly numerous in areas such as Hudong, Huxi, and Hubei.</p>
<h3>Registration of Owner-Absent Houses to be Handled Next Month</h3>
<p>Simultaneously Held in Hubei and Huxi Districts</p>
<p>The Land and Housing Management Committee for Owner-Absent Houses in Shanghai stated that since the incident (presumably the outbreak of war with Japan), most of the house owners in Shanghai have moved elsewhere. While many have returned, a significant number have not yet returned to Shanghai, resulting in the lack of management of all owner-absent houses. This has often led to situations such as being occupied, demolished, or damaged.</p>
<p>In order to safeguard private houses of those who have left Shanghai and protect the property rights of the people, the Committee has decided to start conducting housing registration in the entire Hubei district starting from September 1st of this year, and this has been approved by the Municipal Government. All house owners in the district, excluding enemy property, who are currently in Shanghai, are required to bring their valid property ownership documents to the Committee's Hubei office (27 Fusheng Road, 4th floor) to apply for registration within three months, from September 1st to November 30th. After verification, a registration certificate will be issued to the owner. Registration fees will be charged according to the type of housing, divided into four categories: A, B, C, and D, with fees of 40 yuan, 30 yuan, 20 yuan, and 10 yuan respectively. Failure to register within the specified period will be deemed as owner-absent, and the Committee will take over the management, assess the rental value, and rent it out on their behalf until the owner returns to Shanghai, presents sufficient property ownership documents, applies for verification, and it is verified as true, after which it will be returned.</p>
<p>Those currently occupying owner-absent houses in the district must truthfully report to the office and must not conceal the fact. They must also sign a lease agreement with the office within two months, from September 1st to October 31st, otherwise they will be ordered to move out. Those who know about the occupation but do not report it, intending to continue occupying it, will, upon discovery or report by others, be ordered to move out and be fined ten months of the current rental value of the occupied house, with 50% of the fine used as a reward for the informant. The Hubei district includes the areas under the jurisdiction of the Xihongkou, Hongkou, North Sichuan Road, Tilanqiao, Yangshupu, Yulin Road, and Zhabei police stations.</p>
<h3>Housing Registration Also Held in Huxi at the Same Time</h3>
<p>The Committee's Huxi office is also conducting housing registration in the entire Huxi district at the same time. The district includes the areas under the jurisdiction of the Huashan Road, Changning Road, and Xuhui police stations. As for the Committee's Nanshi office, the housing registration has been completed. There are still a small number of owners who have not received their registration certificates. The Committee has ordered the owners to bring their supporting documents to the Committee's Second Section at 367 Jiangxi Road, Municipal Government, to collect their certificates.</p>
<h3>Shandong Native Place Association to Solemnly Worship Confucius</h3>
<p>The Shandong Native Place Association on Ximen Road in Shanghai, in order to promote culture and advocate Confucianism, raised funds this spring to renovate the Dacheng Pavilion and Confucius Temple of the association. The project has now been partially completed. The carved beams and painted pillars have an antique charm, making it a unique historical site in Southeast China. The 28th of this month is Confucius's birthday, and it also coincides with the first anniversary of the association's establishment. It is planned to hold a grand ceremony combining both events. At that time (2:00 PM), Honorary Chairman Su Chengde and Chairman Cui Jingsan will personally preside over the ceremony. The Confucius worship ceremony will be extremely solemn. Members of the association and students from Qilu primary and secondary schools will participate together. After the Confucius worship, a memorial meeting will be held, with wonderful entertainment programs to add to the festivities.</p>
<h3>Weekly Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Financial and Industrial Conditions in Shanghai This Week</p>
<p>Compared with the previous week, the financial and industrial conditions in Shanghai have changed slightly this week. However, the situation is complex and intertwined. Amidst tightening credit conditions, Shanghai gold rallied after falling. Chinese stocks were sluggish, while the prices of various rice grains, miscellaneous grains, and foodstuffs all increased. Due to the Mid-Autumn Festival period, various industries were busy collecting payments, requiring funds to cover debts, and the demand for funds on the market was high. In view of the recent rise in prices, most of which is still due to speculative funds, the Central Reserve Bank has taken further steps to tighten interbank lending in order to prevent speculation and hoarding. As a result, the market prices of various investments have fallen and stocks have been released. However, there are still some investors with capital who are taking this opportunity to purchase and hoard materials, which has led to a continued rise in prices. It is reported that the city's economic authorities are closely monitoring and cracking down on these activities.</p>

<h3>Mr. Miyamoto Morio Gave a Second Speech Yesterday, Indicating the Path for Chinese Students</h3>
<p>The Third Wartime Academic Lecture jointly organized by this newspaper and the Xinwen Bao invited Mr. Miyamoto Morio to speak. He spoke to primary and secondary school teachers at Yucai Middle School the day before yesterday. Yesterday (24th) at 3:00 PM, he spoke to more than 150 university and middle school students in this city at the Industry and Commerce Association Friendship Hall. First, Mr. Huang Jingwan, director of the Social Service Department of this newspaper, gave an introductory speech, followed by Mr. Miyamoto's speech, entitled "The Path for Chinese Students." The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>Schools are Not Myopia Training Centers</p>
<p>After meeting with you today, I immediately noticed that many of you wear glasses. This is the same as in Japan. I have studied this and believe that it is related to the structural form of Chinese and Japanese characters. Since the development of printing technology, the miniaturization of fonts has led to an increasing number of people suffering from myopia. Although our knowledge is greater than that of the average person, is our personality also higher than that of the average person? This is worth examining.</p>
<p>When I was studying in Japan, I had a regret, feeling that schools only created learned people, and then failed to combine them with personality. Whether this knowledge that is inconsistent with personality is usable is really worth reflecting on.</p>
<p>A person is formed by both spirit and body. Wearing glasses means that you have a defect compared to ordinary people. If the blood in the body stops in a certain part and cannot circulate, then health problems will occur, so activity is very important.</p>
<p>You should reflect on whether schools are myopia training centers, whether putting knowledge into your brains is all that matters. You need to pay attention to this yourself. We should understand that schools are not just places to sell knowledge, nor are we entering schools to earn money in order to obtain a job. Schools are places to cultivate outstanding talents for the country, and that is the meaning of the scholarship system.</p>
<p>Cultivating the Nation's Outstanding Talents</p>
<p>The life of an individual is limited, but the life of a country is infinite. The nation is eternal, and the individual is temporary, but the source of the nation is people, and the spirit of the nation is expressed by each individual. In order to continue the life of the nation, it is necessary to cultivate outstanding talents to succeed the nation. You all have a very important mission. You must not think of yourselves as conservatives of knowledge, but as outstanding successors of the country, and even leaders among the successors of the country and nation.</p>
<p>You all have the potential to become leaders in the future, but you should also think about whether you have the conditions to be leaders. There may not be a lesson on learning to be a leader in school, but you can learn leadership while studying. This is the meaning of the current youth organization composition. I hope you can start by leading small youth groups in your own schools, and then become leaders of the country in the future.</p>
<p>After the speech, the students raised several questions, which Mr. Miyamoto answered one by one. Finally, the national anthem was sung, and the meeting adjourned in a solemn and harmonious atmosphere.</p>
