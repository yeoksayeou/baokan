<h3>社評　一個建議</h3>
<p>昨天本市陳市長，實業部陳部長，暨日大使館當局分別發表談話，盼望市民協助當局，撿舉不良份子操縱米市。同時，聲明第二警察局已經緝獲案犯多人，正在研訊。第一警察局亦已獲得綫案，正在查緝。足見上海米市確有不良份子投機操縱。我們曾在五月十九日社評中，卽已指出本市米價黑市波動之烈，實有若干不肯份子，在幕後投機操縱所致，這般投機操縱者，常然又是追求暴利主義者。又在上週末，當米市閃電波動之時，卽指陳重慶特務人員正在利用時機掀風作浪，完成其擾亂人心的目標。其次，奸商正狼狽爲奸，操縱黑市，遂其暴利企圖。我們並非毫無根據，危詞聳聽。我們認爲米價閃電波動，固然具有種種內在外在的客觀原因，可是這些原丙，決不是發於一旦，決不會促使閃電波動至如此程度。而人爲的操縱，才是促使閃電波動的主因。現在讀了當局的談話，對於我們先前的指陳，證實了確有操縱黑市的不良份子。我們主張對這輩只知追求私利，而不顧大衆的暴利主義者，經嚴密偵訊，判明確實後，應即處以戰時犯罪極刑，懲一儆百，以爲不肖者戒。</p>
<p>其次，我們也不能忽略操縱以外的原因，譬如來源疏通問題，自然極關重要。當局雖已聲明國「汪經中央命令米統會及各地政府獎勵採辦，疏通來源，以期獲得充分之供給數量。」可是，「疏通來源」，重在實踐，尤共對於過去辦理疏通來源成績不佳的原因，必須先加避免，例如採辦價格的合理，運輸工具的增加，沿途勒索的取締等等。</p>
<p>自從公布自由運米辦法以後，本市若干規模較大的工商企業機關。團體，單獨或聯合直接向各地採辦米糧，確是很好的辦法。又如富有人家存米較多，對於配給需要比較緩和。惟有一般勞動者與微薪階級，家無三日積糧之輩，對於配給米的需要最爲殷切。進一步分析，有時配給米較爲粗糙，富有人家根本不以爲食，而貧苦之輩視同性命。所以，我們建講於市政當局，即山市府籌集款項，或向國家銀行借貸現金，往產地採辦米糧，配給或平　。配給或平　的對象，先就勞動者及微薪階級，醫如工廠工人，交通公一用事業之職工－電車公司，郵政職工等。採辦時並不限於米穀，同時兼辦雜糧。江北各地新麥已經登塲，舊存之苞米豆麥，價値較米低廉二三倍，均可採辦，運滬配給。如能切實採辦疏運，對於木市民食實際上有所調節，則米價趨平，較有實效。</p>
<p>總之，米價問題，非有緊急處理，不易紋平。日前一度回平後，近兩日間再度高翔，固然是不正常的波動，希望大家不必爭購，反予操縱者以機會。可是，不加有效抑制，則不正常的波動，也不免形成自然靜止狀態，視爲正常。所以，一面希望當局對於投機操縱者嚴厲處刑，以遏亂剪。一面必須籌款採辦米穀及雜糧，先配給於勞動階曆及微薪階級，以收切實抑平之效。</p>

<h3>全部大西洋鋼　壁德宣布緊急狀態　猛將如雲信必能應付戰局</h3>
<p>柏林九日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：德當局因鑒於英美軍對瑟堡哈佛區之攻勢，故大西洋鋼堡德軍防綫其餘各地區，均已宣布緊急狀態。侵犯軍於六月六日上午所採用之戰術，未能產生任何驚人之事。該日之戰事行動，德軍高級司令部稱，德海陸空軍有良好之合作，沿海區不少鐵絲網障物與閂形陣地，以及各大防禦壘，均已完成其任務。不斷在比斯開灣與海峽中巡邏之德海空軍，對於阻止敵之實行襲擊，貢獻甚大。</p>
<p>柏林九日中央社電　據哥本哈根來電：北法方而已開始登陸作戰，丹麥方面亦頗有此種危險，但反軸心軍迄今尙無對該方面開始行動之趨勢，因丹麥西岸一帶沙灘甚多，無論使用任何新式水陸兩用戰車，亦須以連日天氣良好爲先決條件。茍反軸心軍漠視天氣前來攻擊，當不免受莫大犧牲。刻德軍炮兵隊正日夜戒備，以待其前來。</p>
<p>柏林九日中央社電　美英圖謀已久之歐洲登陸戰終於開始，最近將來德軍在歐洲要塞之強韌，以及國防軍之眞價，行將畢現於大西洋岸。西歐德軍總局司令倫台特元帥，不僅爲德國防軍最高之戰略家，又爲實戰塲之名將。其轉戰於西部戰綫時，曾被稱爲「電擊作戰之華」，　諸於塞當突破馬奇諾防綫之功勳，即可得知。當前年春季，蘇聯向美英要求成立第二戰綫之際，元帥更感到防衛西歐之重要，於是乃奉希特勒元首之命，自烏克蘭戰綫轉任法佔領地駐軍總司令。是年十一月進駐法國非佔領地帶，完成大西洋岸至地中海沿岸之鐵石防衛陣。元帥在第二戰綫論初倡時，即　邀擊軍總司令之重任，元帥之背後尙有「機甲部隊智將」之羅美爾元帥，故此次之西歐作戰，德軍行將發揮其邀擊隊敏捷之機動性。現在羅美爾身任西歐德軍監察官，以豐富之經騐，竭力調查歐洲要塞之防備，以及駐守軍之訓練狀況。羅元帥本爲機甲戰大家，於北非戰前，業於西部戰綫曾以「骷髏師團」之威名震撼英軍，由其經歷之戰史觀之，此次亦必立於殲滅敵軍主力之陣頭。據情報稱，羅元帥已就任倫台特元帥麾下之陸軍總司令，又西歐地區之荷蘭有庫里斯塡散元帥，比利時有法堪豪散，丹麥駐有哈奈坎堅爾大將兩名，擔當司今之職。挪威有法堪豪斯特將軍，芬蘭有狄特爾大將。德軍在大西洋岸之防衛嚴如鐵壁，而歐洲大陸腹部之地中海方面，在義戰綫有凱賽林元帥，東南歐地區之巴爾幹有維克斯元帥坐鎭中。凱賽林元帥曾歷任空軍要職，其於義戰綫所發揮之智謀雄略已充分表現。維克斯元帥亦必能以歷戰之經騐，防備山岳地帶之馬爾幹。</p>
<h3>侵歐戰事　入第二階段　柯坦汀半島敵續登陸</h3>
<p>里斯本九日中央社電　據倫敦電：反軸心歐洲總局司令部八日發表：反軸心軍在法國海岸設立橋頭堡後，侵攻作戰之第一階毅即吿終結，於此戰局巳突入第二階段。刻已在登陸地點附近加強橋頭堡與德守備軍交戰。至第三階段則在於吸引德預備軍並力向與之交戰，因爲不能擊潰德預備軍之主力，則反軸心軍將不能推進作戰，一如初期戰爭之順利</p>
<p>柏林九日中央社電　海通社訊，軍界息：反軸心軍繼續在卡倫坦·克恩·及巴猶等海濱據點登陸，發動第三次進攻。</p>
<p>柏林九日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：侵犯戰之第二日傍晚，敵軍之登陸中心，係在堡基特及阿羅曼煦斯之間，敵方大量空輸部隊降落於柯坦汀半島之東邊，德軍在此區之攻擊巳發生效果，在星期三之作戰，顯示敵軍企圖衝出柯坦汀半島及瑟堡港，且將來戰事之性質及範圍，亦將視此半島之戰事而定。星期三晨敵以轟炸機及雙引擎戰鬥機約六百架，出動於各戰區，以支援其登陸之部隊，但遭德高射炮及大炮之有效攻擊，敵滑翔機及運輸機數百架整日運輸軍隊降陸，而登陸之焦點係在格朗維爾。該地於登陸時前即受轟炸。戰區向北延至柯坦汀半島西面之柯本斯地方，猛烈戰事正在此各點進行中。</p>
<p>奧納河岸擴大橋頭</p>
<p>柏林九日中央社電　據前綫消息：關於北法戰況之推移，自七日晚至八日晨，德軍已使強大之戰略預備兵，出勤參加反攻作戰，同時敵軍亦繼續增援新銳登陸部隊，繼續拼力擴大橋頭堡，因之全綫戰事益趨激烈。　戰事中心地仍在奧納及維爾兩河中間，該處敵軍橋頭堡，截至八日上午已長達六十公里，敵軍在克恩及巴　兩地形成兩大突出口，自德軍撤出巴猶市後，敵之突出口最深處即達於該市南方，克恩市目下兩軍亦展開熾烈巷觀。敵軍</p>
<p>在該地帶之塞納灣之格蘭坎及阿羅曼煦等地，已有具備重武器之兩師團登陸，同時該地上空亦有敵滑翔機數百架往來頻繁，其空軍部隊似亦增加相當兵力矣。自巴猶市南下之敵軍，目下與德軍在距城七八公里之處展開激戰，巴猶市東方斯爾河地方亦繼續激戰中。該地敵軍主力爲蒙高茂萊軍，其全力約有十師團，內中含有戰車師三師團。　柯坦汀車島地方美國空軍部隊，自降落於卡倫坦北部後，因得援軍戰車部隊開到，遂轉取攻勢，德軍目下暫取守勢。</p>
<p>巴猶古鎭德軍撤退</p>
<p>柏林九日中央社電　德軍當局八日宣稱：英軍戰車隊，八日上午侵入馬猶市（Bayeux），刻更向西南方進攻，數量上佔劣勢之德軍已自巴猶市撤退，該市就大西洋要塞全體而論，無何等重要意義。</p>
<p>柏林九日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：美麗之巴猶古鎮，經侵犯軍闖入後。已成廢墟，同時威廉大帝遺骸所在之克恩市鎮，亦在一片火焰中，該市鎭現仍在德軍手中。</p>
<p>柏林九日中央社電　據八日北法前綫消息：克恩正展開熾烈巷戰，自七日下午起，該市已化爲雙方戰車部隊混戰之所。</p>
<p>大批敵艦升火待發</p>
<p>柏林九日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：據精密之估計，艾森霍華將軍僅以其十分一之兵力參加作戰，故可推想其必有更多之登陸行動。德海空軍之偵察報吿，在英南岸之英美軍正在移動中，在英國海峽及愛爾蘭海大量登陸艦隊，已升火待發。故德軍司令倫台特元帥有鑒及此，明令預備軍之主力取待機形勢，尤其德空軍主力似尚未出動於北法戰綫防戰，僅不過爲登陸作戰之初步，至於正式大戰將於今後展開。</p>
<h3>反軸心警吿沿海漁民</h3>
<p>日內瓦九日中央壯電　德國新聞社訊：反軸心軍最高當局今日向挪·荷·丹·比·法·諸國之漁民發出警吿如下：茲規定於七日以內（即自六月八日晚九時至十五日晚九時）所有一切捕魚工作須停止，漁民目下居於港口者不可遷移，但其工作於海面者，須即刻返家，其不聽警吿者將發生危險而阻碍反軸心軍之作戰。</p>
<p>德空軍發揮威力沉毀敵船艦多艘</p>
<p>柏林九日中央社電　海通社訊：星期四夜德戰鬥機在奧納河口炸沉登陸船五艘共三一〇〇〇噸，此外運輸船及軍艦亦有中彈者，其中受創者有輕巡洋艦二艘·軍隊運輸艦一艘·及貨船二艘·共二六〇〇〇噸。另有重巡洋艦一艘受重創，恐已喪失，船上發生極大混亂，英美兵士死於起火之船上或跳入海中者爲數甚多，大批軍火坦克東軍需亦沉入海底。</p>
<p>柏林九日中央社電　德軍當局發表：反軸心侵歐作戰自開始迄今，德軍曾擊落其飛機百九十三架，又擊落或鹵獲其輸送滑空機千三百架以上。</p>
<p>英美傘兵配備一斑</p>
<p>柏林九日中央社電　海通社戰地記者韋勃稱：此次在法降陸之反軸心國傘兵及空軍部隊，其配備與一年前余在西西里所見者相同。彼等携有半自動來復槍或手槍及大量炸藥，身穿短統靴·巨袋制服·鋼盔·紅皮帶·所携糧食若麥片湯茶巧格力等，均係固體狀，足供兩三日之食用，每兵配備連兵器在內，約重八十公斤。此次降陸之兵士復携小袋一只，內藏地圖，入夜頸間圍發光之圍巾，以便於黑暗中互相識別，此等兵士中有技術專家，大份部兵士之任務，僅在修理奪獲之德軍汽車而已。</p>
<h3>侵歐作戰計劃　蒙特巴頓所擬</h3>
<p>瑞典京城九日中央社電　海通社倫敦息：反軸心軍進攻諾曼第之計劃，最初係由蒙特巴頓擬就，後即經蒙高茂萊將軍採納，現即根據此項計劃而實施。</p>
<p>東京九日中央社電　反軸心軍英軍司令蒙高茂萊大將，現年五十四歲，民三十一八月反軸心軍侵入北非時，氏普任埃及方面英第八軍司令，繼任突尼斯方面英軍司令，直屬於當時之北非反軸心軍總司令艾森霍華部下，是年九月三日突破墨西拿海峽，率英兵於義本土登陸。自去年底以來即任進攻歐洲反軸心軍英軍總司令。渠曾謂戰勝之秘訣，在於空陸緊密協力作戰，無制空權即無勝利，此即爲近代戰之至上原則。北非作戰以來，渠之作戰方針，始終在忠實愼重履行此至上原則，故凡　所指揮之處，必須有大批之軍需物資及充分之準備時間。觀此次登陸作戰前後情形，即可知反軸心軍之侵歐戰法，乃全根據蒙高茂萊之愼重原則而實行者也。</p>

<h3>爪哇動員學生　參加勞動服務</h3>
<p>爪加爾達九日中央社電　軍政監部教育局，爲使全爪哇數百萬學生直接奉加各種產業建設工作等，藉以涵養靑年學生之勤勞服務精神，並鍛鍊體格，近乃決定學童動員計劃，指示各州民即日實施。此動員學生爲國民學校四年級生以上者，包括中學·大學·專門學校等學校，幷根據各州長所指示之計劃，動員從事增產戰力上所必耍之各種勞勸服務。</p>
<h3>太平洋戰局的現階段</h3>
<p>敵方機動部隊頻頻出沒於中部太平洋，近又反復空襲南鳥島，太平洋戰局日趨緊張。敵方最近高唱一有機會即轟炸日本本土，尼米資艦隊此後的動向，亦抱着空襲日本本土的野心，亟須警戒。日本聯合艦隊在豐田司令長官統率之下，對敵太平洋艦隊的蠢動，嚴加監視。太平洋現正在暴風雨的前夕，前途如何；實難逆覩。太平洋的敵方反攻，大槪可分爲四部：</p>
<p>第一是緊縮拉巴爾包團綫的作戰。第二，以新幾尼亞戰綫上的霍蘭第耶登陸爲重要契機的敵基地之西進及陸戰的新展開。第三，敵方向馬紹爾羣島或阿杜米拉地諸島推進航空基地的結果，對中部太平洋諸島的空襲激化。第四，敵機動部隊反覆來襲中部太平洋方面，展開機動作戰。</p>
<p>去年此日，所羅門方面，從瓜達爾加納爾的轉進作戰方才吿終，敵方專念於向所羅門的新登陸作戰的準備。在新幾尼亞方面，從布那轉進後，敵人當企圖西進，被日軍對該方面的敵船團反覆轟炸，而挫折其企圖。在中部太平洋，敵人攻略吉爾伯特的態勢尙未準備完成，而波汲於維持澳洲—夏威夷的補充綫。這一年間，敵人一意着手增產飛機，而從以重整的機動部隊爲主的太平洋總反攻。在所羅門一帶，用跳島作戰方法經由蒙達，特洛基那，格林島到達阿杜米拉地諸島。在新幾尼亞一帶，經薩拉摩河，拉愛，芬希哈罕的血戰，而至霍蘭第耶。在中部太平洋從吉爾伯特推進基地至奎塞林，羅奧脫等。在此期間，敵人侵攻的速度，不可謂不速，是以太平洋戰局愈趨深刻。</p>
<p>上述四部分的太平洋戰局，不用說，各以其有機的密切關係而進展，尤以新幾尼亞戰綫與中部太平洋之戰，更堪注意。新幾尼亞戰，一意從北岸西進，其目標顯然逐漸推進基地侵攻菲列濱。敵機動部隊的襲擊中部太平洋，轟炸對新幾尼亞側面有重大威脅的日軍諸基地，顯然也有牽制作用。三月末，尼米資與麥克沃塞會議之後，因所羅門方面戰況的轉變而解放哈爾塞艦隊，並討論此後戰略，這事實，暗示擔任新幾尼亞作戰的麥克沃塞與統率太平洋艦隊的尼米資之間，在攻略菲島上，已有聯絡。</p>
<p>尼米資的野心</p>
<p>尼米資艦隊除援助麥克沃塞作戰的側面以外，更抱着想完成侵攻日本本土的野心。以大機動部隊，出動十數艘或二十餘艘的航空母艦，飛出數百架艦載機，用局地絕對優勢主義，在局部集中壓倒的航空兵力，在局地確保制空權，恃其數量的龐大而欲來攻襲日本本土，這企圖是很明顯的，假使他們企圖從海上空襲日本本土，恐怕不像前次一樣，將出動大部隊。但日本早已有備無患。</p>
<p>然這種襲擊，其轟炸是一時的，在時間上有所限制，故空襲吿終，正如暴風雨已經過去，亦即恢復常態。宣傳的效果或許是很大的，但戰略的效果並不希奇，且敵太平洋艦隊的頻頻出動，其目的無非想誘出日軍聯合艦隊要求決戰。敵方的意見，與聯合艦隊決戰，抱着奪回太平洋制海權的野心；或由於此次會戰，自身雖也受到相當損害，但能靠其生產力立即補充，因而多少可抵消日本艦隊的勢力。四月初旬，敵無綫電軍事評論家說：</p>
<p>「美國的攻擊特魯克島，乃在挑撥日本，挑動艦隊決戰。……在美國看來，不知道日本艦隊的所在，是最感困苦的一件事。所以要求日本艦決戰，一舉而擊滅之，是絕必要的。因此，美國乃集結歷史上空前的勢力，攻擊派拉俄諸島。」</p>
<p>紐約泰晤士報也說：</p>
<p>「美國機動部隊攻擊特魯克的主要目的，乃在擊滅日本艦隊。」</p>
<p>敵方的畏懼</p>
<p>上述言詞，顯然對聯合艦隊的勢力頗表畏懼。日本聯合艦隊保持緘默，秘其所在，在敵人實以爲是神秘的東西。因此，敵人乃亟欲誘出日本艦隊決一雌雄。尼米資艦隊就負着這困難的任務而在太平洋海面蠢動。對此，日本聯合艦隊在豐田大將的作戰指導下，已完成其作戰準備而保護太平洋。在近代海戰中，所謂艦隊決戰，並不是像日本海海戰中所見的艦隊遭　戰，那是陸上基地航空兵力與艦隊航空兵力之有機的聯繋作戰，帶着複雜的狀態。滿佈着這種基地的中部太平洋，於是遂成爲展開近代海戰的絕好海域。太平洋戰局正在日趨緊張中。當此開戰後第三次海軍紀念日，我們對豐田司令長官，寄着極大的依賴。（翔譯自五月二十五日東京朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>英美侵歐戰　終必遭擊潰　松島報部長發表談話</h3>
<p>盟邦日本在滬艦隊報道部長松島大佐，於昨（九）日下午三時，在循例報道常會席上，就英美今次之侵歐作戰及南太平洋必阿克島作戰，發表談話如次：</p>
<p>日軍猛攻必島美軍</p>
<p>松島部長首對南太平洋必阿克島之攻防戰發言，謂敵美海軍已遭受日本海軍强烈之打擊，並言英美發表如開始侵歐作戰行動時，同時在太平洋方面亦趨一致行動，然至今敵美方面則一無所逞，又謂敵美於最近會誇大宣傳，佯稱佔領必阿克島之據點，松島部長特對此加以駁斥，並謂與事實適得其反，蓋必阿克島之美軍，經日軍猛烈之攻擊後，巳逃遁至必島之南部，目前已瀕潰滅，即以美軍之隨軍記者，對此亦曾發表謂美軍在必島之挺進，在日軍嚴密攻擊下，頗爲困難云云。故在此次之作戰結果，美已遭受意料不及之打擊，日對日軍之英屬果敢精神，深爲畏　，經此强烈之作戰後，敵突已被迫逐漸向後　　狀態中。</p>
<p>鄧克扣之重演預料</p>
<p>松島部長　就敵英美侵歐作戰發言，關於敵在歐洲侵略作戰之戰局，迄至昨日止，敵軍在法之北部諸曼第之登陸，刻經德軍之强大攻擊，敵軍大部已遭殲滅。頃據本月八日華盛頓電，美陸軍部長史汀生所發表之談話，對於英美目前之情形，暴蠶無遺，謂形成　頭堡陣綫之聯合軍，業已侵入法北，在初期雖有遭受猛烈反攻之危機，應忍耐靜待戰局之變化，是以我人測視史之所言，足以證明英美在目前之困難情形，蓋過去敵美自作戰以來，從未有如上之談話發表，此外如在滬之德國情報部，對今次英美之侵歐作戰，並不重視，日頗悠然，我人當可想及不久之英美，將再遭受鄧扣克重演之覆轍。</p>
<p>二三日內將有發展</p>
<p>關於侵歐作戰之敵兵力，有美總指揮艾森　華部下　高茂萊所率領計爲五十師團，飛機九千架，其首次登陸軍力爲十師團，空中輸送有四師團，再以敵方所言在侵歐登陸時所用飛機爲一萬一千架，艦艇爲四千轉，基此上述而觀，純爲虛談誑語，絕難成爲事實，而我人以觀德軍寸備之陣容，在德最高指揮官倫合德將軍部下，羅美爾元帥統率下抵禦，而羅在北非戰塲，棄負盛名，稱爲猛將，查德目前在第一綫之準備軍力，達六十師以上，且後方更有大量預備軍，預計此次德軍之作戰，在此二三日內，尙有最重要之發展。</p>
<p>美澳恐慌人的資源</p>
<p>部長復詳述美國及漢大利亞人的資源之缺乏，謂最近之美國對人力之缺乏，發生嚴重之恐慌，他如駐國外之使館職員，亦經政府下令征用服役，並對本國及澳洲之國民服役年齡，亦已修改，前定征役十九歲以上之靑年，今已改爲自十八歲六個月起，强制入役，因此遭受澳洲國民之不滿，曾在無綫電台中廣播，謂澳洲之末日即將降臨云云，並如目前在澳洲牧塲中，牧羊人已大感缺乏，所謂迷途之羔羊，今在澳洲已屬遍見云云。</p>
<h3>體育　助學金足球義賽　東華勝僑聯　三比一保持常勝</h3>
<p>本報寗募讀者助學金，舉辦足球義賽，特邀常勝軍東華隊對壘西人勁旅僑聯隊，於昨日下午五時三刻，在跑馬廳舉行，東華繼續保持勝利紀錄，結果三比一勝僑聯，上半時二比一佔先。昨賽爲表示隆重起見，特請林康侯氏行開球禮，影星李香闌李麗華兩女士給獎。各界熱心仕女踴躍購券，紛紛查來，總數不下兩萬餘人，盛况空前，因得警務當局之協助，故昨日球塲秩序井然。僑聯邀得津聯四將參加，實力大增，東華攻勢雖勢，屢攻不入，比賽全程，緊張精彩，茲記大戰祥情如次：</p>
<p>二比一球東華佔先</p>
<p>裁判玄谷正柱，五時三刻球賽開始，由林康侯氏開球。兩軍交鋒，戴統帥率領三軍，浩蕩前進，羅旭萊救駕心切，阻成角球，幼良開來，落點極佳，張林根衝前頭頂，被麥尼蒂躍起接住。五分鎖時，奧托尼洛單騎直入，至二十碼處傳球飽傑，飽傑按住一脚，峻急非常，幸張邦綸眼明手快，接個正着。廿分鐘時，孫錦順戴麟經，一唱一和，盤過西拉蒂，遙送幼良，買凌空一脚，正中麥尼蒂身，僑聯勿失此球，亦云幸矣。三十五分時戴麟經過五關斬六將，羅旭萊救駕心切，猛撞阿戴，被判罰十二碼球，由孫錦順執法，球刁而急，中門柱彈入，東華首開紀錄。旋賈幼良開角球，張林根趨前一頂，被麥尼蒂撲出，李垚於人羣中竄出再頂，膽而快，美妙無比，距獲第一球僅差二分鐘耳。僑聯諸將復仇心切，攻勢頓盛，前鋒綫連絡極佳，上半時終塲前二分鐘，奧托尼洛猛力衝刺，張邦綸急忙價出，誤撞奧托尼洛，被　十二碼球，鮑傑操刀，張邦綸接而復失。僑聯板回一城，上半時終了，東華二此一佔先。</p>
<p>東華保持常勝榮譽</p>
<p>休息時間由李香問李麗華兩女土給獎，分贈東華僑聯大銀杯各一座，再戰聲中，迪盤那進調出巴瑪，麥尼蒂則易台杜卡，如此攻守咸形增加，球屢盤旋於東華門前，幸李寗莊友仁迎敵有方，未爲所逞，四分鐘時，奧托尼洛於混亂中攻入一球，但因亞托馬利之越位，被判作廢。一刻鐘時，賈幼良邊綫切中，戴麟經輕傳，孫錦順　子翻身，一勾而入，三比一東華佔絕對優勢，未幾阿戴啣枚疾進，至離門十餘碼處派司韓龍海，未能成功，旋阿戴又得幼良妙傳，台社卡衝出，頓成空門，然孫錦順建功心切，用力太猛，竟吿飛逸。僑聯傾師反攻，維拉攻門李寗一碰，險成倒戈。幸張邦綸輕舒猿臂，未有差池。雙方互有攻門機會，均因功虧一簣，未克奏功。法定時間吿終，東華以三比一凱旋，保持常勝榮譽。</p>
<p>東華　張邦綸，李寗，莊友仁，梁樹某，　福楨，張林根，李垚，孫錦順，戴麟經，韓龍海，買幼良。</p>

<h3>國民論壇　讀消滅暴利主義文有感</h3>
<p>— 明遠</p>
<p>讀五月三十一日中報社評「消減暴利主義」文中，謂當此戰時有兩大敵人，其一是暴利主義，其二是共產主義·詞意警惕·可謂一針見血之讜論，殊堪欽佩。暴利主義固爲造成共產主義之主因，然暴利主義何以日見抬頭，其勢何以若是之猖獗，必有致此之厲階，爰爲分析如左：</p>
<p>戰爭矚日持久，商塲一切經營失去常軌，循規蹈距者遭遇失敗，而不肖之徒，往往利用機會，不擇手段，到處鑽營，推波助浪，無所不用其極，一朝得利，窮措大驟成富家翁，社會對之不但不加制裁，反有艷羨之聲。因是人人均認此爲千載一時之良機，爭起效尤，而國積投機之風，遂如火之燎原不可撲滅。富者愈富，窮者愈窮，哀鴻遍野，餓莩載道，而此悲慘境界，方且爲一般舉利主義者悖入悖出盡情享受之塲所，言之痛心。</p>
<p>因囤積投機之風旣盛，政府當局勢難坐視，不得不籌措防止之對策，於是種種統制管理辦法，先後頒發，無數類似統制管理之機構，應運而生，其系統旣不分明，辦理復不一致，狡黠之輩花樣百出，甚至官商勾結，狼狽爲奸，不惜利用統制管理等辦法，明目張膽，巧取豪奪，以求塡其無壓之慾麼，遂致造成今日暴利主義不可遏止的局面。</p>
<p>因有官民交爭利之事實，物價不僅無法跌落，且有日益高漲之勢，家家戶戶，唯恐將來無力購物，故購之者愈多，而物價愈高漲，奸商之追求暴利。亦愈亟矣。加以通貨膨賬不已，人多重物而輕幣，所謂存幣不如存物，彼等購物之目的，並非囤積，實爲儲藏，物價無論漲至如何程度，非萬不得已絕不出售其儲藏之物，此亦無形中助長暴利主義之氣燄者者。</p>
<p>近年來商塲中所設之企業公司或實業公司百貨公司等，有如雨後春筍，雖無一非經核准註冊，然究其實際，其能以正當企業爲營業範圍者，爲數殊詳。大都從事國積投機，以獲取非分之利，爲唯一出路，設之年來增資之風起雲湧，即知其梗槪，此又假借工商名義獲取舉利者也。</p>
<p>最可慨者，辦理統制不言增產，牧購物資定價不合實際，方法不求妥善，交通運輸不能暢達，農村社會不能安定，在在助長暴利主義，人謀不臧，此中關係固不待智者而喩。</p>
<p>暴利生養之成因固多然上述各端，若能一一設法加以澈底剷除，則暴利主養者自無容身之餘地，共產主養亦不致發生，所謂戰時大敵不難消滅矣。</p>

<h3>給妹妹的信（十）海軍</h3>
<p>— 岩田豐雄著　洪洋譯</p>
<p>過了不幾天，　夫收到了一個枝抹來的句裹。包裹中不僅有想念的「海軍」雜誌和軍艦照片簿，而且還有一件　摩綢的冬衣，線背心，好吃的點心等。這種掌掛，枝妹作得眞有點過份。他身受到慈母無言之愛，而情不自禁地熟涙迸流了。</p>
<p>包裹雖然來了，但信始終不來。他十二分地苦心思索對親的態度。枝妹回信遺樣晚，或許就是雙親不允許自己請求的證據。</p>
<p>又過了十天左右的星其六，比平常回到公寓去都晚的他。看到了未在家時送來的一封快信明片。是市來德次郎畫家寫來的一封簡單信，說明天星期日請來一談。</p>
<p>隆夫本打算在星期天去畫海而到房州去，但因爲有多蒙關照的書家來了一個命令，所以無法去只好走一趟。</p>
<p>第二天上午，他來訪久別的市來家。</p>
<p>「喂，聽說你是脫藩人，是吧？」</p>
<p>畫家故意說着古色古香的字眼，而向隆夫笑了。</p>
<p>「呵？」</p>
<p>「隱瞞我也無用了。我收到了這樣一封信。」</p>
<p>市來把一封厚厚的信，原對不動地拋到棹子上，隆夫一看到筆蹟，却大吃一驚。用濃濃的的墨筆所演出的　颯的字，顯然是父親的親筆字。</p>
<p>「脫藩之罪，是很嚴重的呀！如果在古來，那就是死罪。然而近來鹿克島也似乎大形減輕這樣罪名了。你念這封信吧！」</p>
<p>畫家佯作不知的樣子這樣說。隆夫就展開了父親的信。</p>
<p>父親作夢也未曾想到，隆夫是常來市來畫家處的，而父親只是因市來爲家鄕出身的著名畫家，便託朋友介紹，而寫的這封信。在那封介紹信中，曾原原委委寫着隆夫的失踪以及未來的志向。同時還寫着，希望市來對於這個擅離家鄉的兒子，加以管敎，如張允諾，則每月可審學費來，如兒子成爲一個畫家時，再面謝，－請將此意轉達自己的兒子，並且介紹出隆夫的姓名住址來。</p>
<p>「明白事理的父親，在鹿兒島地方眞是難得</p>
<p>「呵！」</p>
<p>隆夫因慚愧和感謝，而低下頭去。</p>
<p>「據說你願常　海洋畫家，是麼？」</p>
<p>「呵！」</p>
<p>「山岳畫家訓練一個海洋畫家，這有點不大妥當，但在日本，並沒有一個海洋門畫家，所以只好將就。」</p>

        <h1>1944 - n158</h1>
<h3>Editorial: A Suggestion</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Mayor Chen of our city, Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry, and the Japanese Embassy authorities each issued statements hoping that citizens would assist the authorities in exposing unscrupulous individuals manipulating the rice market. At the same time, they declared that the Second Police Bureau had already arrested several suspects and was interrogating them, and that the First Police Bureau had also obtained leads and was investigating. This shows that there are indeed unscrupulous individuals speculating and manipulating the Shanghai rice market. In our May 19th editorial, we already pointed out that the severe black market fluctuations in the city's rice prices were caused by some unwilling individuals speculating and manipulating behind the scenes. These speculators are, of course, pursuing profit at all costs. Furthermore, last weekend, when the rice market experienced flash fluctuations, we pointed out that Chen Chongqing's special agents were taking advantage of the opportunity to stir up trouble, with the aim of disturbing the public. Secondly, unscrupulous merchants are colluding to manipulate the black market, pursuing their own profiteering schemes. We are not making baseless claims or exaggerating to create alarm. We believe that while the flash fluctuations in rice prices do have various internal and external objective reasons, these reasons did not arise overnight and would not cause such extreme flash fluctuations. Artificial manipulation is the main cause of the flash fluctuations. Now, after reading the authorities' statements, our previous accusations have been confirmed to be true that there are indeed unscrupulous individuals manipulating the black market. We propose that these profiteers, who only care about their own interests and disregard the public, should be thoroughly investigated, and after their guilt is confirmed, they should be immediately sentenced to the harshest wartime punishment as a warning to others.</p>
<p>Secondly, we cannot ignore the reasons beyond manipulation. For example, the smooth flow of supplies is of utmost importance. Although the authorities have declared that "the Wang Jingwei central government has ordered the Rice Control Council and local governments to encourage purchasing and facilitate supply flow, in order to obtain a sufficient supply quantity," the "facilitation of supply flow" depends on practical action. In particular, the reasons for the poor performance of past efforts to facilitate supply flow must be avoided, such as reasonable purchase prices, increased transportation capacity, and the elimination of extortion along the way.</p>
<p>Since the announcement of the free rice transportation policy, some larger industrial and commercial enterprises and organizations in the city have independently or jointly purchased rice from various regions, which is a good approach. Also, wealthy families have more rice in storage, so their need for rationed rice is relatively less urgent. However, ordinary laborers and those with low salaries, who have no more than three days' worth of food at home, are most in need of rationed rice. Further analysis reveals that sometimes the rationed rice is of poor quality, which wealthy families do not even consider eating, while poor people regard it as their lifeblood. Therefore, we suggest that the municipal authorities, namely the Shanghai Municipal Government, raise funds or borrow cash from national banks to purchase rice from production areas and distribute it through rations or at a set price. The target of rations or fixed prices should first be laborers and low-wage earners, such as factory workers and employees of public utilities, such as tram companies and postal workers. When purchasing, they should not be limited to rice but should also purchase coarse grains. New wheat from Jiangbei has already entered the market, and stored corn, soybeans, and wheat are two to three times cheaper than rice, all of which can be purchased and transported to Shanghai for distribution. If they can earnestly purchase, facilitate transportation, and make practical adjustments to the food supply of the city's residents, then rice prices will tend to stabilize and be more effective.</p>
<p>In short, the rice price problem requires urgent handling to stabilize it. After briefly returning to normal recently, it has soared again in the past two days. This is certainly an abnormal fluctuation, and we hope that everyone will not rush to buy, which would give speculators an opportunity. However, without effective suppression, abnormal fluctuations may become a natural, static state and be regarded as normal. Therefore, on the one hand, we hope that the authorities will severely punish speculators to curb the chaos. On the other hand, they must raise funds to purchase rice and coarse grains and distribute them to laborers and low-wage earners first, in order to achieve a real effect of suppressing prices.</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Arrive Six Kilometers North of Changsha: Chongqing Military Headquarters Announces on the 8th</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 9th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from Chongqing, the Chongqing Military Headquarters announced on the 8th that Japanese troops, with Changsha as their target, are currently advancing from the north.

<h3>Captured Chongqing Soldiers Deeply Feel that Resistance is Not the Way</h3>
<p>Luoyang, 9th (Central News Agency) - Chongqing soldiers captured by the Japanese army have now realized the wrongfulness of past resistance under the protection of the Japanese army and are willing to be fighters for a new China in the future. The following is the memoir written by Qiu Xixian (24 years old), a lieutenant and military doctor belonging to the Ninth Army. The main points are as follows: "Although we were constantly incited to fight in the rear, we knew about the strength of the Japanese army. We deeply know the danger of fighting with the Japanese army. In the daily newspapers, we learn that the Japanese army is stubborn and brutal, but judging from what has happened, it is not so. Although we are captured, we have three meals a day, and except for weapons, all the items we own are returned to us. The so-called brutal looting is the behavior of our soldiers. After being captured, I heard that the 15th Army and the 64th Division, which retreated from the Shangqinggao Highlands, fled to Luoyang City, but the 14th Army in the city not only refused them entry but also took actions similar to supervising the battle. How they are against resistance is incomprehensible."</p>
<h3>Shaoxing Cao'e Highway Can be Completed at the End of the Month</h3>

After communication between the two sides, it will soon be returned and managed by the department. The Construction Department has drafted an organizational budget and submitted it to the provincial government for approval. Once approved, it can be taken over.</p>
<h3>Philippine Administrative Officials Prohibited from Exercising Police Power</h3>

<h3>Ministry of Industry's Agriculture and Forestry Department Holds Symposium</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) - The Agriculture and Forestry Department of the Ministry of Industry held a symposium for the persons in charge of various farms and districts.

<h3>Han Wenbing Appointed Director of Air Force</h3>

<h3>Party Worker Training Corps Holds Graduation Ceremony</h3>

<h3>Agriculture Promotion Council Formulates Reward Work Methods</h3>

<h3>Entire Atlantic Steel Wall; Birdt Declares State of Emergency; Confident that Talented Generals Will be Able to Cope with the Situation</h3>
<p>Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports: In view of the Anglo-American offensive against the Cherbourg-Le Havre area, the German defense line on the Atlantic Steel Wall in other areas has been declared to be in a state of emergency. The tactics used by the invading forces on the morning of June 6th did not produce anything surprising. The German High Command said that the German army, navy, and air force cooperated well in the military actions that day. Many barbed wire obstacles, gate-shaped formations, and major defensive fortifications along the coastal area have completed their tasks. The German navy and air force, which are constantly patrolling the Bay of Biscay and the English Channel, have made great contributions to preventing the enemy from carrying out attacks.</p>
<p>Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from Copenhagen: Landing operations have already begun in northern France, and there is also a considerable risk of this kind in Denmark. However, the anti-Axis forces have not yet shown any signs of starting operations in that area. This is because there are many beaches along the west coast of Denmark, and good weather for several consecutive days is a prerequisite for using any new amphibious vehicles. If the anti-Axis forces ignore the weather and attack, they will inevitably suffer great sacrifices. The German artillery corps is now on alert day and night, waiting for them to come.</p>
<p>Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - The Anglo-American long-planned landing war in Europe has finally begun. In the near future, the strength of the German army in the European fortress and the true value of the National Defense Army will be fully revealed on the Atlantic coast. Field Marshal Lundstedt, commander-in-chief of the German army in Western Europe, is not only the highest strategist of the German Defense Army but also a famous general on the battlefield. When he fought on the Western Front, he was called the "Flower of Blitzkrieg." From his exploits in breaking through the Maginot Line at Sedan, we can know about that. When the Soviet Union asked the United States and Britain to establish a second front in the spring of the year before last, the Marshal felt the importance of defending Western Europe. He was ordered by Führer Hitler to transfer from the Ukrainian front to serve as the commander-in-chief of the garrison in the occupied territories of France. In November of that year, he entered the non-occupied areas of France and completed the impregnable defense line from the Atlantic coast to the Mediterranean coast. When the theory of the second front was first proposed, the Marshal was assigned the important task of [illegible] commander-in-chief of the counterattack army. Behind the Marshal is also Field Marshal Rommel, the "Intellectual General of the Armored Forces." Therefore, in this Western European operation, the German army will bring out the agility and maneuverability of its counterattack team. Rommel is now serving as an inspector of the German army in Western Europe, using his rich experience to investigate the defenses of the European fortress and the training of the garrison. Marshal Rommel is a master of armored warfare. Before the North African War, he had already shaken the British army with the fame of the "Skull Division" on the Western Front. From the perspective of his war history, he will surely stand at the forefront of annihilating the main force of the enemy in this operation. According to intelligence, Marshal Rommel has assumed the post of Commander-in-Chief of the Army under Marshal Lundstedt. In addition, the Netherlands in Western Europe has Marshal Kulitscher, Belgium has Falkanhausen, and Denmark has General Hanekenel, who hold the positions of commanders. General Falkanhorst is stationed in Norway, and General Dietl is stationed in Finland. The German army's defense on the Atlantic coast is as strong as an iron wall. In the Mediterranean region of the European mainland, Marshal Kesselring is in charge of the Italian front, and Marshal Weichs is in charge of the Balkans in Southeastern Europe. Marshal Kesselring has held important positions in the Air Force. His wisdom and strategy in the Italian front have been fully demonstrated. Marshal Weichs will also be able to use his experienced combat skills to defend the mountainous Balkans.</p>
<h3>Invasion of Europe Enters Second Stage: Enemy Continues Landing on Cotentin Peninsula</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 9th (Central News Agency) - London reports: The Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force announced on the 8th that the first stage of the invasion operation had concluded after the Allied forces established a beachhead on the French coast, and the battle had entered the second stage. They are currently strengthening the beachhead near the landing site and engaging with German defense forces. The third stage involves attracting German reserve forces and engaging them in battle. If the main force of the German reserve forces cannot be defeated, the Allied forces will not be able to advance the operation as smoothly as in the initial stages of the war.</p>
<p>Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency reports, according to military sources: Allied forces are continuing to land at coastal strongholds such as Carentan, Caen, and Bayeux, launching a third offensive.</p>
<p>Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports: On the evening of the second day of the invasion, the enemy's landing center was between Burgquet and Arromanches. A large number of enemy airborne troops landed on the eastern side of the Cotentin Peninsula. German attacks in this area have been effective. The operation on Wednesday showed that the enemy was attempting to break out of the Cotentin Peninsula and Cherbourg port. The nature and scope of future battles will depend on the fighting on this peninsula. On Wednesday morning, the enemy dispatched approximately 600 bombers and twin-engine fighters to various war zones to support their landing troops, but they were met with effective attacks from German anti-aircraft guns and artillery. Hundreds of enemy gliders and transport planes transported troops to land throughout the day. The focus of the landing was Granville, which was bombed prior to the landing. The war zone extends north to Cobenz on the west side of the Cotentin Peninsula, and intense battles are taking place at these points.</p>
<p>Expanding Bridgehead on the Banks of the Orne River</p>
<p>Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - According to frontline reports: Regarding the progress of the battle in Northern France, from the evening of the 7th to the morning of the 8th, the German army mobilized strong strategic reserve forces to participate in counter-offensive operations. At the same time, the enemy continued to reinforce new landing troops, continuing to strive to expand the bridgehead, thus intensifying the battles along the entire front. The center of the battle remains between the Orne and Vire rivers. The enemy bridgehead in that area had reached a length of 60 kilometers by the morning of the 8th. The enemy formed two major salient points in Caen and Bayeux. After the German army withdrew from the city of Bayeux, the deepest point of the enemy's salient extended to the south of the city. Intense street fighting is also underway in Caen. The enemy has landed two divisions equipped with heavy weapons in areas such as Grandcamp and Arromanches on the Seine Bay in that area. At the same time, hundreds of enemy gliders are frequently traveling over that area, and their air force seems to have increased its strength considerably. The enemy troops advancing south from Bayeux are currently engaged in fierce fighting with the German army about 7-8 kilometers from the city. Fierce fighting also continues in the areas of the Sierre River east of Bayeux. The main force of the enemy in that area is the Montgomery army, with a total strength of approximately ten divisions, including three tank divisions. In the Cotentin Peninsula, the U.S. Air Force units, after landing north of Carentan, took the offensive after receiving reinforcements from tank units. The German army is currently taking a defensive position.</p>
<p>German Troops Withdraw from Ancient Town of Bayeux</p>
<p>Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - German authorities announced on the 8th that British tank units invaded the city of Bayeux on the morning of the 8th and are currently advancing southwest. The German forces, which are outnumbered, have withdrawn from the city of Bayeux, which has no significant importance in terms of the entire Atlantic fortress.</p>
<p>Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports: The beautiful ancient town of Bayeux has become ruins after being invaded by the invading army. At the same time, the town of Caen, where the remains of William the Conqueror are located, is also in flames. The town is currently still in the hands of the German army.</p>
<p>Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - According to frontline reports from Northern France on the 8th: Intense street fighting is taking place in Caen. Since the afternoon of the 7th, the city has become a battleground for tank units from both sides.</p>
<p>Large Numbers of Enemy Ships Raise Steam, Awaiting Departure</p>
<p>Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports: According to precise estimates, General Eisenhower is only participating in the operation with one-tenth of his forces, so it can be assumed that he will have more landing operations. German naval and air force reconnaissance reports indicate that British and American forces are moving on the southern coast of England. A large number of landing fleets in the English Channel and the Irish Sea have raised steam and are awaiting departure. Therefore, German Commander Field Marshal Rundstedt, in view of this, ordered the main force of the reserve forces to take a standby posture. In particular, the main force of the German air force does not seem to have yet been deployed on the Northern French front, and this is only the preliminary stage of the landing operation. The formal battle will unfold in the future.</p>
<h3>Allied Warning to Coastal Fishermen</h3>
<p>Geneva, 9th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports: The Allied High Command today issued the following warning to fishermen in Norway, the Netherlands, Denmark, Belgium, and France: It is hereby stipulated that all fishing activities must cease within seven days (i.e., from 9:00 PM on June 8th to 9:00 PM on June 15th). Fishermen currently residing in ports must not move, but those working on the sea must return home immediately. Those who do not heed the warning will face danger and obstruct the Allied operations.</p>
<p>German Air Force Unleashes Power, Sinks Many Enemy Ships</p>
<p>Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency reports: On Thursday night, German fighter planes sank five landing ships totaling 31,000 tons at the mouth of the Orne River. In addition, transport ships and warships were also hit, including two light cruisers, one troop transport ship, and two cargo ships, totaling 26,000 tons. Another heavy cruiser was severely damaged and is feared lost. Great chaos occurred on the ship, and many British and American soldiers died on the burning ship or jumped into the sea. A large amount of ammunition, tanks, and army supplies also sank to the bottom of the sea.</p>
<p>Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - German authorities announced that since the beginning of the Allied invasion of Europe, the German army has shot down 193 enemy planes and shot down or captured more than 1,300 transport gliders.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of British and American Paratrooper Equipment</p>
<p>Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency war correspondent Webb stated: The equipment of the Allied paratroopers and air force units that landed in France this time is the same as what I saw in Sicily a year ago. They carry semi-automatic rifles or pistols and a large amount of explosives, wear short boots, large-pocket uniforms, steel helmets, and red belts. The food they carry, such as oatmeal, tea, and chocolate, is all solid and sufficient for two or three days of consumption. Each soldier is equipped with weapons weighing about 80 kilograms. The soldiers who landed this time also carried a small bag containing a map. At night, they wore luminous scarves around their necks to identify each other in the dark. Among these soldiers are technical experts. The task of most of the soldiers is only to repair captured German vehicles.</p>
<h3>Invasion of Europe Plan Devised by Mountbatten</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 9th (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency, London: The plan for the Allied invasion of Normandy was initially devised by Mountbatten, and then adopted by General Montgomery and is now being implemented based on this plan.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) - Allied British Commander General Montgomery is 54 years old. When the Allied forces invaded North Africa in August 1931, he was appointed as the commander of the British Eighth Army in Egypt, and then as the commander of the British forces in Tunisia, directly under the command of General Eisenhower, the then Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in North Africa. On September 3rd of that year, he broke through the Strait of Messina and led British troops to land on the Italian mainland. Since the end of last year, he has served as the Supreme Commander of the Allied British Forces invading Europe. He once said that the secret to victory lies in close cooperation between air and land operations. Without air supremacy, there is no victory. This is the supreme principle of modern warfare. Since the North African campaign, his operational policy has always been to faithfully and carefully implement this supreme principle. Therefore, wherever he commands, there must be a large number of military supplies and sufficient preparation time. Observing the situation before and after this landing operation, it can be seen that the Allied invasion of Europe is entirely based on Montgomery's cautious principles.</p>

<h3>Javanese Students Mobilized to Participate in Labor Service</h3>
<p>Jakarta, 9th (Central News Agency) - In order to enable millions of students throughout Java to directly participate in various industrial construction works, cultivate the spirit of diligence and service among young students, and strengthen their physique, the Education Bureau of the Military Administration Department recently decided on a student mobilization plan, instructing the states to implement it immediately. This mobilization of students includes students from the fourth grade of national schools and above, including middle schools, universities, and specialized schools. According to the plans instructed by the state governors, they will be mobilized to engage in various labor services essential for increasing production and war effort.</p>
<h3>The Current Stage of the Pacific War</h3>
<p>Enemy mobile units are frequently appearing in the Central Pacific, and have recently repeatedly bombed Minamitori Island. The Pacific war is becoming increasingly tense. The enemy has recently been loudly proclaiming that they will bomb the Japanese mainland as soon as they have the opportunity. The subsequent movements of the Nimitz Fleet, also harboring the ambition to bomb the Japanese mainland, require urgent vigilance. Under the command of Commander-in-Chief Toyoda, the Japanese Combined Fleet is closely monitoring the movements of the enemy Pacific Fleet. The Pacific is currently on the eve of a storm, and it is difficult to foresee the future. The enemy's counter-offensive in the Pacific can be roughly divided into four parts:</p>
<p>First, the operation to tighten the encirclement line of Rabaul. Second, the westward advance of enemy bases and the new deployment of land battles, with the landing at Hollandia on the New Guinea front as an important opportunity. Third, the intensification of air raids on the islands of the Central Pacific as a result of the enemy's advancement of air bases to the Marshall Islands or the Admiralty Islands. Fourth, the enemy's mobile units repeatedly attacking the Central Pacific area,展开机动作战。</p>
<p>On this day last year, in the Solomon Islands, the withdrawal operation from Guadalcanal had just ended, and the enemy was focused on preparing for a new landing operation in the Solomon Islands. In New Guinea, after the withdrawal from Buna, the enemy attempted to advance westward, but their attempts were frustrated by repeated bombings of enemy convoys in that area by the Japanese army. In the Central Pacific, the enemy's efforts to capture Gilbert had not yet been completed, and they were preoccupied with maintaining the supply line between Australia and Hawaii. During this year, the enemy focused on increasing the production of aircraft, and launched a general counter-offensive in the Pacific, mainly with reorganized mobile units. In the Solomon Islands, they used an island-hopping strategy to reach the Admiralty Islands via Munda, Torokina, and Green Island. In New Guinea, they advanced through the bloody battles of Salamaua, Lae, and Finschhafen to Hollandia. In the Central Pacific, they advanced bases from Gilbert to Kwajalein, Roi-Namur, etc. During this period, the speed of the enemy's invasion cannot be said to be slow, and the Pacific war has become increasingly profound.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the above four parts of the Pacific war are progressing with organically close relations, and the New Guinea front and the Central Pacific war are particularly noteworthy. The New Guinea war is focused on advancing westward from the north coast, and its goal is clearly to gradually advance bases and invade the Philippines. The enemy's mobile unit's attacks on the Central Pacific, bombing Japanese bases that pose a significant threat to the side of New Guinea, also clearly have a restraining effect. After the meeting between Nimitz and MacArthur at the end of March, the Halsey Fleet was released due to the change in the situation in the Solomon Islands, and the subsequent strategy was discussed. This fact suggests that there is already contact between MacArthur, who is in charge of the New Guinea operation, and Nimitz, who commands the Pacific Fleet, on the capture of the Philippine Islands.</p>
<p>Nimitz's Ambition</p>
<p>In addition to assisting MacArthur's operations, the Nimitz Fleet also harbors the ambition to complete the invasion of the Japanese mainland. With a large mobile unit, deploying more than a dozen or twenty aircraft carriers, flying hundreds of carrier-based aircraft, using the principle of local absolute superiority, concentrating overwhelming air power in a localized area, ensuring air supremacy in a localized area, and relying on its sheer size to attack the Japanese mainland, this attempt is very obvious. If they attempt to attack the Japanese mainland from the sea, it is unlikely that they will deploy a large force like last time. However, Japan is already prepared for any eventuality.</p>
<p>However, such an attack, the bombing is temporary, and there are time constraints, so when the air raid ends, just as the storm has passed, it will return to normal. The publicity effect may be great, but the strategic effect is not remarkable. Moreover, the frequent deployment of the enemy's Pacific Fleet is nothing more than an attempt to lure out the Japanese Combined Fleet and demand a decisive battle. The enemy's opinion is that a decisive battle with the Combined Fleet, harboring the ambition to regain control of the Pacific; or because of this battle, although they themselves will also suffer considerable damage, they can immediately replenish their forces due to their productivity, thereby somewhat offsetting the power of the Japanese fleet. At the beginning of April, an enemy wireless military commentator said:</p>
<p>"The American attack on Truk is to provoke Japan, to provoke a decisive battle of fleets... In America's view, not knowing the whereabouts of the Japanese fleet is the most difficult thing. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to demand that the Japanese resolve the battle and destroy it in one fell swoop. Therefore, America has gathered an unprecedented force in history to attack the Palau Islands."</p>
<p>The New York Times also said:</p>
<p>"The main purpose of the American mobile unit's attack on Truk is to destroy the Japanese fleet."</p>
<p>The Enemy's Fear</p>
<p>The above words clearly express considerable fear of the power of the Combined Fleet. The Japanese Combined Fleet remains silent, keeping its whereabouts secret, which is regarded as something mysterious by the enemy. Therefore, the enemy is eager to lure out the Japanese fleet to fight a decisive battle. The Nimitz Fleet is carrying out this difficult task and moving around in the Pacific Ocean. In response, the Japanese Combined Fleet, under the operational guidance of General Toyoda, has completed its operational preparations to protect the Pacific. In modern naval warfare, the so-called fleet decisive battle is not a fleet encounter battle as seen in the Battle of the Sea of Japan, but an organic and interconnected operation of land-based air power and fleet air power, with a complex state. The Central Pacific, which is full of such bases, has thus become an excellent sea area for deploying modern naval warfare. The Pacific war is becoming increasingly tense. On this, the third Navy Day since the start of the war, we place great reliance on Commander-in-Chief Toyoda. (Translated from the May 25th Tokyo Asahi Shimbun by Xiang)</p>

<p>Implementation of Air Raid Blackout</p>
<p>From 9:00 PM to 10:00 PM, an air raid blackout was implemented, but no alarms were sounded. At 9:00 PM sharp, the Baojia reporters transmitted air raid warnings to residents within their respective jurisdictions by ringing bells and hammers. All vehicles began driving on the left side of the road, and the lights inside the vehicles were turned off. Pedestrians also walked to the left. All street lights were turned off, and the lights in shops and households were completely shielded with curtains and door drapes to prevent light from leaking out. The entire city entered a black market state. Japanese planes took off to patrol and search the sky with searchlights. Emotions were extremely tense. Military police and personnel from the Air Defense Headquarters patrolled various places. At 10:00 PM, the air raid blackout was lifted and a vigilance blackout was entered. Normal lighting was not restored until 10:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Preparatory Office of the Vagrant Labor Camp Receives Business Leaders, Hoping for Enthusiastic Sponsorship from All Sectors</h3>
<p>The Municipal Vagrant Labor Camp, since its preparation by the Ministry of Social Welfare in conjunction with the municipal government, and with the cooperation of leaders from all sectors of the city, has been actively proceeding under the united efforts of officials and civilians. However, due to the high start-up costs, it has been decided to solicit donations from all sectors of the city. Therefore, at 5:00 PM yesterday (9th), a tea party was held at the meeting hall of the Industry and Commerce Association to receive representatives from the city's industry and commerce sectors. Minister of Social Welfare Ding Mocun attended on time. Mayor Chen, due to official business in Beijing, specially sent Secretary-General Wu to attend on his behalf. Directors Li Sihao and Xiang Kangyuan, as well as Director of the Social Welfare Bureau Sun Mingqi, Director of the Social Problems Research Institute Wu Wenwei, Director of the International Labor Affairs Office Chen Jingbai, and Director of the Camp Preparatory Office Zhou Yuying also attended. The Economic Bureau also sent Section Chief Wu to participate. More than 100 representatives from various industry associations in the city, including Zhu Boquan, Shen Weiting, Shen Jinzhou, Ding Fangyuan, Zhao Rutiao, and Chen Fukang, attended. First, Minister Ding reported on the purpose of establishing the camp, hoping for enthusiastic sponsorship and active donations from all parties. Then, Wu Songgao delivered a speech on behalf of Mayor Chen, elaborating on the relationship between providing work training for vagrants and beggars and the overall social livelihood and public security, hoping to lay the foundation for the initial work. He also hoped that all sectors would assist in promoting the early establishment of the camp with the enthusiasm of benefiting oneself and the country. Finally, Director Li Sihao delivered a speech, hoping that the representatives from all sectors would provide strong assistance. The event ended at 6:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Health Week Invites Chen, President of This Newspaper, to Give a Lecture at 5:00 PM Today</h3>
<p>Since the opening of the Shanghai YMCA National Health Movement on the 3rd of this month, many people have visited the exhibition, watched the sports performances, and listened to the lectures. This association not only focuses on physical health, but also on the gradual progress of psychological and mental health, which is particularly important. At 5:00 PM today, Chen, the president of this newspaper, will be invited to give a lecture on national health and the construction of a new China.</p>
<p>Male Bodybuilding Competition Tonight</p>
<p>The Shanghai Male Bodybuilding Competition will be held at 8:00 PM tonight. This event can be called a pioneering event in our country and has never happened before.

<h3>Daily Necessities Rationing Begins Today in the Nanshi District</h3>
<p>The third phase of household coal briquettes and matches, soap, in the entire Nanshi district has been widely distributed by designated retail stores. However, it has been found that the matches and soap purchased by citizens in the district have been replaced with inferior miscellaneous brands, and the coal briquettes are mostly mud rather than coal dust, with numerous drawbacks, which is truly regrettable. It is hoped that the authorities will investigate and stop this, and it is hoped that citizens in the district will cooperate in reporting any violations at any time. It is best to bring your own municipal scales to weigh the coal briquettes to prevent shortages in weight.</p>
<h3>Health Exhibition Closes</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Health Movement Exhibition, which opened on the 1st of this month, has concluded all its activities, with satisfactory results. The authorities are currently evaluating and rewarding them separately. The health exhibition has been exceptionally popular with the public. The association originally scheduled it from June 1st to 7th, but due to the repeated ball games and races of the Sports Association, which affected public visits, the authorities extended the exhibition to the 15th in order to allow the public to visit. However, on the 10th and 11th, due to the Sports Association's races, it will be open as usual in the morning and closed in the afternoon. On the 12th, 13th, 14th, and 15th, it will be open all day for anyone to visit. Various manufacturers will also continue to sell goods at a 10% discount to show their preferential treatment.</p>

<h3>Reader Scholarship News: Application Forms to Be Issued Starting on the 12th</h3>
<p>The application procedures and instructions for the seventh session of the reader scholarships sponsored by this newspaper have been announced in the newspaper three times and sent to major primary and secondary schools. In recent days, schools have sent letters with lists of impoverished students applying, but a small number of schools have over-reported the number of applicants, which this newspaper cannot accommodate. According to the regulations, the number of applicants per school is limited to 5%. Only if the number approved in the previous session exceeded the limit will a concession be made.

<h3>Anglo-American Invasion of Europe Will Inevitably Be Defeated: Statement by Director of the Matsushima News Agency</h3>
<p>Colonel Matsushima, the press director of the Allied Japanese fleet in Shanghai, made the following statement at the regular press conference yesterday (9th) at 3 pm regarding the Anglo-American invasion of Europe and the Battle of Biak Island in the South Pacific:</p>
<p>Japanese Forces Fiercely Attack American Forces on Biak Island</p>
<p>Director Matsushima first spoke about the offensive and defensive battles on Biak Island in the South Pacific, stating that the enemy American Navy had suffered a strong blow from the Japanese Navy. He also said that when the British and Americans announced the start of the invasion of Europe, they also took consistent action in the Pacific, but so far the enemy Americans have achieved nothing. He also said that the enemy Americans recently exaggerated their propaganda, falsely claiming to have occupied a stronghold on Biak Island. Director Matsushima specifically refuted this, saying that it was the opposite of the truth. The American forces on Biak Island, after a fierce attack by the Japanese army, had fled to the southern part of Biak Island and were now on the verge of collapse. Even the American military reporters had stated that the American advance on Biak Island was quite difficult under the intense attack of the Japanese army. Therefore, as a result of this battle, the United States suffered an unexpected blow. Japan deeply admired the courageous spirit of the Japanese army, and after this intense battle, the enemy suddenly was forced to gradually retreat.</p>
<p>Dunkirk to Be Repeated, Expected</p>
<p>Director Matsushima then spoke about the British and American invasion of Europe. Regarding the war situation of the enemy's invasion in Europe, as of yesterday, the enemy forces landing in Normandy in northern France were under strong attack by the German army, and most of the enemy forces have been annihilated. According to a Washington dispatch on the 8th of this month, the statement issued by US Secretary of the Army Stimson revealed the current situation of the British and Americans without reservation, saying that the joint forces forming the beachhead had invaded northern France. Although there was a crisis of suffering a fierce counterattack in the initial stage, they should patiently wait for changes in the war situation. Therefore, the words of Stimson can prove the difficult situation of the British and Americans at present. The enemy Americans have never made such a statement since the war began. In addition, the German intelligence department in Shanghai does not pay attention to this British and American invasion of Europe and is quite leisurely. It can be expected that the British and Americans will soon suffer a repeat of the Dunkirk debacle.</p>
<p>Developments in the Next Two or Three Days</p>
<p>Regarding the enemy's troop strength in the invasion of Europe, it is said that the total commander of the Americans, Eisenhower, had 50 divisions under the command of High Commander Gaumolly, with 9,000 aircraft. The initial landing force was 10 divisions, and the airborne transportation was 4 divisions. Furthermore, according to the enemy's claims, the number of aircraft used in the invasion of Europe was 11,000, and the number of ships was 4,000. Based on the above, these are purely empty words and lies, and it is impossible for them to become reality. As for the German army's preparations, under the command of General Lunstedt, the supreme commander of Germany, and Marshal Rommel, who was famous for his defeats in the North African theater and was known as a fierce general, defended. It is estimated that the current German military force on the front line has reached more than 60 divisions, and there are also a large number of reserve troops in the rear. It is expected that the German army's operations will have the most important development in the next two or three days.</p>
<p>American and Australian Panic About Human Resources</p>
<p>The director further elaborated on the lack of human resources in the United States and Australia, saying that the United States recently faced a serious panic over the lack of manpower. For example, the staff of embassies abroad have been ordered by the government to be drafted for service. The age of national service for nationals of the United States and Australia has also been revised. The previously set drafting age for young people over the age of 19 has now been changed to compulsory service from the age of 18 and a half, which has caused dissatisfaction among Australian nationals, who broadcast on the radio that the end of Australia is coming. Currently, there is a great lack of shepherds in Australian pastures, and the so-called lost sheep are now common in Australia.</p>
<h3>Sports: Scholarship Fundraising Soccer Charity Match: Donghua Wins Over Overseas Chinese 3-1, Maintaining Unbeaten Record</h3>
<p>This newspaper specially invited the ever-victorious Donghua team to compete against the Western team, Overseas Chinese, for a soccer charity match to raise reader scholarships. The match was held at the Racecourse yesterday at 5:45 PM. Donghua continued to maintain its winning record, defeating Overseas Chinese 3-1. Donghua was ahead 2-1 in the first half. To show the importance of the event, Mr. Lin Kanghou was specially invited to perform the opening kick, and movie stars Li Xianglan and Li Lihua presented the awards. Enthusiastic ladies from all walks of life purchased tickets in large numbers, totaling no less than 20,000 people, making it an unprecedented spectacle. Thanks to the assistance of the police authorities, the order at the stadium yesterday was well maintained. Overseas Chinese invited four generals from Tianjin to participate, greatly increasing their strength. Although Donghua's offensive was strong, they repeatedly failed to score. The entire game was tense and exciting. The details of the battle are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Donghua Leads 2-1</p>
<p>Referee Xuan Gu Zhengzhu started the game at 5:45 PM with the opening kick by Lin Kanghou. The two armies faced off, and Dai commanded the three armies and marched forward vigorously. Luo Xulai was eager to rescue and blocked a corner kick. Youliang opened it, and the landing point was excellent. Zhang Lingen rushed forward to head it, but was caught by McNity, who jumped up. At five minutes, Otoniel dribbled straight in and passed the ball to Baojie at 20 yards. Baojie held it and kicked it very quickly. Fortunately, Zhang Banglun was quick to catch it. At 20 minutes, Sun Jinshun and Dai Linjing sang in harmony, dribbled past Sirati, and sent it to Youliang from afar. Mai made a volley, hitting McNity squarely on the body. Overseas Chinese did not lose this ball, which was fortunate. At 35 minutes, Dai Linjing passed five levels and killed six generals. Luo Xulai was eager to rescue and slammed into A Dai, which was judged as a 12-yard penalty. Sun Jinshun enforced the penalty. The ball was tricky and rapid, hit the goalpost, and bounced in. Donghua scored first. Then Jia Youliang kicked a corner kick, Zhang Lingen stepped forward and headed it, but was pushed out by McNity. Li Yao emerged from the crowd and headed it again, boldly and quickly, incomparably wonderful, only two minutes away from getting the first goal. Overseas Chinese was eager to take revenge, and the offensive suddenly increased. The connection between the forward lines was excellent. Two minutes before the end of the first half, Otoniel rushed violently, and Zhang Banglun hurriedly priced out, accidentally hitting Otoniel, which was judged as a 12-yard penalty. Baojie operated, Zhang Banglun caught and lost again. Overseas Chinese took back a city. At the end of the first half, Donghua took the lead with two to one.</p>
<p>Donghua Maintains Unbeaten Honor</p>
<p>During the break, Li Xianglan and Li Lihua, two female students, gave awards, each presenting a large silver cup to Donghua and Overseas Chinese. In the sound of the battle, Di Pan Na entered and transferred Bama out, while McNity changed to Taiduka, so the offense and defense were increased. The ball repeatedly swirled in front of the Donghua goal, but fortunately, Li Ning and Zhuang Youren resisted effectively. At four minutes, Otoniel scored a goal in the chaos, but it was ruled invalid due to Yatomari's offside. At a quarter of an hour, Jia Youliang cut in from the sideline, Dai Linjing passed lightly, Sun Jinshun turned over, hooked and entered, three to one, Donghua had an absolute advantage. Not long after, A Dai marched forward with a bit in his mouth and passed to Han Longhai more than ten yards away from the door, but he failed. Then A Dai got a wonderful pass from Youliang, and Taisha Ka rushed out, forming an empty door, but Sun Jinshun was too eager to make contributions and used too much force, so he flew away. Overseas Chinese launched a counter-attack. Vera's shot was touched by Li Ning, which almost became an own goal. Fortunately, Zhang Banglun stretched his ape arms lightly and there was no mistake. Both sides had opportunities to attack, but both failed due to lack of success. The statutory time ended, and Donghua returned in triumph with three to one, maintaining the honor of being unbeaten.</p>
<p>Donghua: Zhang Banglun, Li Ning, Zhuang Youren, Liang Shumu, Lu Fuzhen, Zhang Lingen, Li Yao, Sun Jinshun, Dai Linjing, Han Longhai, Mai Youliang.</p>

<h3>National Forum: Thoughts on Reading "Eliminating Profiteering"</h3>
<p>— Mingyuan</p>
<p>Reading the Zhong Bao editorial "Eliminating Profiteering" on May 31st, it stated that there are two major enemies in wartime, one is profiteering and the other is communism. The wording is alert and can be described as a sharp and candid discussion, which is admirable. Profiteering is indeed the main cause of communism, but why is profiteering becoming more and more prominent, and why is its momentum so rampant? There must be severe steps to this, so I will analyze it as follows:</p>
<p>The war has lasted for a long time, and all operations in the business arena have lost their normal track. Those who follow the rules encounter failure, while unscrupulous people often take advantage of opportunities, use unscrupulous means, drill everywhere, push the waves, and do everything possible. Once they make a profit, poor scholars suddenly become wealthy. Society not only does not punish them, but also envies them. Because of this, everyone recognizes this as a good opportunity that comes once in a thousand years, and strives to emulate it, and the speculative wind in the country is like a prairie fire that cannot be extinguished. The rich get richer, the poor get poorer, and wailing is heard everywhere. This tragic situation is also the place for general profiteers to indulge in extravagance, which is heartbreaking to say.</p>
<p>Because the wind of hoarding and speculation is so prevalent, the government authorities cannot sit idly by and have to devise countermeasures to prevent it. Therefore, various control and management measures have been issued one after another, and countless similar control and management institutions have emerged. Their systems are not clear, and the handling is inconsistent. Cunning people come up with various tricks, and even collude with officials and do evil together, not hesitating to use control and management methods to openly and brazenly seize and plunder in order to fill their unbridled desires, which has led to the current situation where profiteering cannot be curbed.</p>
<p>Because there is a fact of competition between officials and the people for profit, prices cannot only fall, but also have a tendency to rise day by day. Every household is afraid that they will not be able to afford to buy things in the future, so the more people buy, the higher the prices rise, and the more eager unscrupulous merchants are to pursue profiteering. In addition, the inflation of currency continues, and people value goods more than currency. The so-called hoarding currency is not as good as hoarding goods. The purpose of their buying goods is not hoarding, but storage. No matter how much prices rise, they will never sell their stored goods unless absolutely necessary. This also invisibly contributes to the arrogance of profiteering.</p>
<p>In recent years, the number of companies, industrial companies, department stores, etc. established in the business arena is like bamboo shoots after a rain. Although none of them has been approved and registered, in fact, the number of those who can use legitimate enterprises as their business scope is very detailed. Most of them are engaged in speculation in the country to obtain unjust profits as the only way out. The wind of increased capital in recent years shows their essence. This is also a person who obtains benefits under the guise of industry and commerce.</p>
<p>What is most regrettable is that the handling of control does not mention increasing production, the pricing of materials does not match the actual situation, the method is not seeking properness, transportation cannot be smooth, and the rural society cannot be stable, which are all helping profiteering. The inadequacy of human efforts is not to be expressed by the wise.</p>
<p>There are many reasons for the birth and development of profiteering, but if the above points can be thoroughly eradicated one by one, then profiteers will have no place to stand, and communism will not occur. The so-called major enemies in wartime will not be difficult to eliminate.</p>
<p>Social services</p>
<h3>This Location Organizes Volunteer Rehabilitation for Opium Addiction</h3>
<p>In response to the Municipal Bureau's anti-drug efforts, this location has specially engaged with the China Moral Improvement Association to organize volunteer rehabilitation for opium addiction. The initial work will focus on rescuing young professionals, gradually expanding to all levels of society. Any employee with a low salary, certified by their service unit's supervisor, can register with this location first. Once a sufficient number of people is gathered, they will be sent to a rehabilitation center for group detoxification. After escaping the sea of suffering, they will be further subjected to moral rehabilitation to prevent relapse. This is to uphold the government's earnest intention to ban opium and to save young people addicted to opium. However, the initial phase of mobilization requires significant expenses, relying on the enthusiasm of society to generously donate funds and jointly support this righteous cause. We eagerly anticipate this.</p>
<p>Moral Lecture: The 17th session of Sacred Learning lectures will be held from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM on the 11th. Mr. Sun Xiangzhong will speak on "The Three Cardinal Virtues of Wisdom, Benevolence, and Courage," Mr. Zhang Gongsu will speak on "The Way of Learning," and Mr. Yang Zhongyi will speak on "New Interpretations of the Book of Changes." All are welcome to attend. The address is Cangzhou Shuchang, No. 470 Chengdu Road.</p>
<p>Dr. Huang Zhenmin Offers Free Treatment: In order to benefit elementary school teachers and impoverished children, Dr. Huang Zhenmin will waive consultation fees for all those certified by the school or introduced by this location. The cost of acupuncture and medicine will be charged at cost. The clinic is located at No. 9, Lane 14, at the intersection of Yongtai Road and Greater Shanghai Road. The daily limit is 20 patients, from 3:00 PM to 7:00 PM.</p>
<p>Puhui Hall Provides Medical Treatment and Medicine: Puhui Hall will provide relief for the poor and sick on the 2nd of this month at Anlu Road.</p>

<h3>Letter to My Sister (10) Navy</h3>
<p>— Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>A few days later, Takashi received a package from his sister. The package not only contained the "Navy" magazine and warship photo album he had longed for but also a satin winter coat, a knitted vest, and delicious snacks. This kind of care from his sister was a bit excessive. He deeply felt his mother's unspoken love and couldn't help but burst into tears.</p>
<p>Although the package arrived, the letter never came. He pondered his parents' attitude with great anxiety. The sister's late reply might be evidence that his parents did not approve of his request.</p>
<p>About ten days later, on a Saturday, he returned to the apartment later than usual. He saw a express postcard that had been delivered in his absence. It was a simple letter from the painter Ichiki Tokujiro, saying that he would like to have a talk with him on Sunday.</p>
<p>Takashi had planned to go to Boso to paint the sea on Sunday, but because he received an order from the calligrapher who had taken care of him, he had no choice but to go.</p>
<p>The next morning, he visited the Ichiki's home after a long time.</p>
<p>"Hey, I heard you are a defector, right?"</p>
<p>The painter deliberately used an archaic expression and smiled at Takashi.</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"It's no use hiding it from me. I received such a letter."</p>
<p>Ichiki threw a thick letter onto the table without touching it. Takashi was shocked when he saw the handwriting. The bold and forceful characters written with thick ink were clearly his father's handwriting.</p>
<p>"The crime of desertion is very serious! In the past, it would have been a capital crime. However, recently, the island of deer seems to have greatly reduced such crimes. Read this letter!"</p>
<p>The painter pretended not to know and said this. Takashi unfolded his father's letter.</p>
<p>His father never dreamed that Takashi often visited the painter Ichiki. His father only knew that Ichiki was a famous painter from his hometown, so he asked a friend to introduce him and wrote this letter. In that letter of introduction, he wrote in detail about Takashi's disappearance and future aspirations. At the same time, he wrote that he hoped Ichiki would discipline this son who had left home without permission. If Ichiki agreed, he could send tuition fees every month. When his son became a painter, he would thank him in person—please convey this intention to his son and introduce Takashi's name and address.</p>
<p>"A sensible father is rare in the Kagoshima area."</p>
<p>"Ah!"</p>
<p>Takashi lowered his head in shame and gratitude.</p>
<p>"I hear you want to be a marine painter, is that right?"</p>
<p>"Ah!"</p>
<p>"It's a bit inappropriate for a mountain painter to train a marine painter, but in Japan, there is no marine painter, so we have to make do."</p>
