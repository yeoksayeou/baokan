<h3>日本的必勝議會</h3>
<p>日本第八十四屆議會自上月二十一日復會以來，連日展開熱烈的議事，以凝結一億日本國民的總力，完成决戰必勝的使命。現在保障「决戰必勝」的預算案以及有關爭取勝利所必需的各種重要法案，大部份都已經議會通過了。預料經過這次議會之後，循着「凝集皇國必勝信念决戰案」的啟示，必能進一步國結日本全國乃至東亞各國的總力，爭取大東亞戰爭園滿的勝利。</p>
<p>這次日本議會中的重要論點，除了預算案，外交問題以外，最値得東亞各國尤其是參戰第二年之中國加以重視的，首先是關於增加軍需生產的問題。東條首相在其施政增加演說中闡明：　航空戰力之增强，較諸去年已達兩倍以上，今後更將增產數倍；　將日本織維工業最高的技術與效牽，轉換於飛機工業。這完全是適應大東亞戰爭决戰階段所急切的需要，因爲今後要完遂戰爭，首先必須取得制空權，給敵人以無情的殲滅。這次議會，就增强戰略物資及整備生產體制進行議事，决定本年度物資計劃。我們中國預定今年是增產年，其目標自然也要配合八東亞戰爭的需要，如何使我國工業在國防要求之下向增加效牽與合理化計劃化之途前進，應該是朝野所急須注意的。</p>
<p>確保主要食糧，安定國民生活，是增强戰力方策的基礎，所以這也成爲此次日本議會的中心議題。本年度日本對於主要食糧，已可確保無缺，而山崎農商相更宣佈食糧增產計劃，即至昭和二十一年度（民國三十五年）合日本本部及朝鮮台灣等在內，米穀產是可較以往增加九百萬石。此外，議會議專中透示滿洲國去年異常盟收，而收買目標，迄一月五日止已超過預定額，故日滿兩國主要食糧已可達成自給勢態。我國一向是以農立國，但是東南諸省魚米之鄉，過去尙須仰給於洋米，自然更談不到以食糧協助盟邦。但是今後如何完成自給自足，應該是我國今日首要的課題。</p>
<p>對於動勞動員，使國民勤勞以完成戰鬥配置，增强戰力，與食糧問題同爲本年日本施政的重心所在，東條首相在議會中明示政府對此具有充分信念，指出本年度勤勞動員的方策，並統一軍事動員與產業動員的關係。我國當局正在高唱「增產」，究將如何動員國民總力，如何實現新國民戰時生活與產業動員等問題，這又是朝野所急須注意的。</p>
<p>從這次日木必勝議會的成就，諸議員以一億國民之代表的重任，熱烈地提出方案，推誠商討，而政府當局也坦白堆指示大局，闡明政策，接納民意，充分表現日本朝野一致向決戰勝利之途挺進的總力。然而，回顧我們中國，民意機關，迄未正式建立，人民意見，無以直接溝通，對於動員民衆，協同决戰，對於團結一致，發揮總力，以與盟邦比較，均感瞠乎其後，我們爲實踐參戰義務，爲適應決戰需要，如何從速設立民實機關，使官民打成一片，尤爲朝野所應猛加反省者。</p>

<h3>美空軍傲慢無狀渝軍民憤慨　渝空軍上尉談渝方近况</h3>
<p>中央社訊渝方空軍某上尉對於駐渝　美空軍之目空一切，傍若無人之傲慢態度，極表情慨，特於去年十二月底脫離昆明，參加和運，日前在上海談渝方近况如次：</p>
<p>渝方目下元全成爲美國之屬下，有心人對此極表憂盧，如參政員張某曾向蔣介石提出抗議，實難美空軍之盲目轟炸，尤當常德作戰之際，濫炸渝方陣地，致遭受莫大打擎，張某要求當局立即處罰美空軍，並彈劾渝方之軟弱態度，渝國防最高會議深恐消息透漏，而將張某加以扣留。渝方當去年十月在莫斯科召開英美蘇三國外長會談發表共同宣言時，見己名亦高列榜上，頗感欣喜，然不旋踵此項宣言即歸於有名無實，而渝方之戰後地位自受東縛，淪方之親德派早已指摘莫斯科會談爲美國發動之謀略，蓋美國目下除此以外。無可驅使渝方反抗日本也。陳誠之辭職說，傳佈甚盛，聞爲不滿於英美之橫暴，及其對渝方之輕視能度。緬甸戰綫渝軍對抗日軍，遭受莫大損耗。余所認爲最這德者，乃渝方空軍已隸屬於駐渝美空電，幾與解散相同。余所屬之飛虎隊分隊，於去年十一月上旬爲美國主體之混合大隊所吸收，歸聖諾德指揮，完全失去自主地位。</p>
<p>目下美國輪往渝方之飛機及軍需品幾均供給史蒂威爾統率之美空軍及聖諾德統奉之美空軍所用，個就有以供給爲名，則其目的在於企圖强迫驅使渝方作戰。最近渝方以古服緬甸爲名，徵發數萬兵員，至印度方面，此亦爲美國陰謀之一，在桂林時據中國銀行高級行員告稱，常地兵士時常醉後逞兇，有時甚至衝入民家，對婦女小孩有所非禮，致民衆無不怨恨徹骨。其次吾人所不滿者，乃靈南方面之軍隊，彼等唯知算官發財，舉凡販貿鴉片，詐取錢財學，無惡不作，恬不爲恥。渝方軍官之辦公費時告不足，致士官之抗戰意織極爲低下，加之武器不足，及受日軍猛攻，對於作戰早已極感恐怖，故有一軍官竟臨陣畏縮，自己用搶擊塲臂腿等部，以冀得能離開戰塲，至後方療養。目前將兵對於抗戰前途均抱懷疑，至下級幹部均無作戰經騐，臨陣逃亡者屢見不鮮。當余脫離重農時。始聞實施學生微兵計劃，淪方之兵役制度，其實施方法向極不良，士兵逃亡後竟無法再行捕獲，若將逃亡人數據寫報告司令部後，則須賠償服裝，故目下車事當局已採用諜報手段，即一聞將兵有逃亡消息時，立即將其上官加以監禁。渝方市民對於大東亞戰學偵相，以消息進受封鎖，難以十分明瞭，惟一般知識份子，均知此次戰爭會爲英美所驅使，結果必爲其所犧牲云。</p>
<h3>華北文化團體　籌組聯合會</h3>
<p>北京三日中央社電　華北中國文化建設協會，華北作家協會，中國文化協會，中國記者會，華北沒　協會，華北音樂協會等六文化國體，爲謀中國文化之復與起見，擬籌組文化圑體聯合會，三日午後六時，由各國體代表於留日同學會召開籌備會議。經協議結果，决完許可中國新劇協會及中國新與美術會參加。文化團體聯合之組織章視內容，係以大東亞共同宣言爲基礎，而於統一之理念下，謀中國文化界之團結，而爲文化界創造新途徑。該會總侖設於北京，此外並於主要各地設置分會·總會設理事長及副理事長各一人·其下又設總務企劃出版等三組，並定每年召開全體大會一次。</p>
<h3>日海軍機隊轟炸敵船團　大型運輸船一艘擊沉</h3>
<p>南太平洋日軍某基地三日中天社　電日海軍機隊，一月三十一日於新幾內亞芬希哈罕附近海面，發見敵連輪船團，當聞對之加以猛炸，擊况其大型運轍般一艘，日機全部安返。</p>
<p>西南太平洋日軍某基地三日中央社電一月三十一日下午，敵統一式B24機五架，來裝阿拉夫拉海達寗巴爾羣島之　姆拉幾方面，日海軍戰鬭機當即邀戰，擊落其二架，日方無損害。</p>
<p>里斯本三日中央社電據新金山來電稱，西南太平洋反軸心軍司令部發表：三十一日日機曾對新不列顚島之阿羅埃及格羅斯特角之美軍陣地加之轟炸。</p>

<h3>經濟動態</h3>
<p>— 逸明</p>
<p>煤的配給</p>
<p>煤價已是一噸漲至二百六十元了·而且還不容易貿到。當局會用極大的努力實施配給。但是辦理配給的是四郊的四個煤棧，以三百萬的居民到四個煤棧去購買煤，其擁擠的情形也就可想而知了。然而這四　煤棧販買配給煤的時間還是有限制的，每天只販賣三小時。結果是特別出了城，往往是空手而回，煤確是底了問題。這種情形是當局所知道的。所以當局也就以不眠不休之精神，進行　種協議。除對一部不良販賣商社加以肅正外，並由政委會王委員長，工務總署羅署長，門頭淸煤礦公司軍管理人白島氏問縝密研究結果，旣已得有解决辦法，……門頭溝礦山上一部分個人販賣業者已捨却個人悄感，並發牲們人礦山利益，全部加入統制組合，如果這組合能够順利選行，市民都能够以公定價格置到煤，則煤的問題總可以親是相當解决了。</p>
<p>獻納故宮舊銅器</p>
<p>獻銅運動已經達到最後的階段了。已經獻過二斤半的每一戶最近又須獻納二斤半，於是街頭廢銅的價格又大昂特易了。用七入塊錢只能買到舊日的銅子五六十個，而住家的銅門環也多半被摘下來凑凑數·最有趣的是博物院祝院長也督飭員工收集院存廢銅二千零九十五斤，浩浩蕩蕩的派員獻納當局，據報袛上所戰的，這些銅類乃是院內各處所存未編號的廢銅片和銅器，對於歷史文物沒有什麼關係。</p>
<p>戰時書施統制經濟，是最自然不過的事·然而因爲我國人向來是散浸無組縱的，對於經濟的統制很不習慣，所以實行起來沒有那樣順利。總算是事實的趨勢，近來北京的人士已經漸漸的習慣了，所以各種統制的實施也就相繼而來。前些日子是棉的統制　開始組機，近來又有化學製品統制機關成立。曾在北京飯店召開華北化學製品統制協會創立總會，從此之後，化學製造品也將正式的國入統制的範圍了。</p>
<p>十年樹木，百年樹人，這本是我國的古訓。櫥不確是不容易，然而誰也沒有想到十年前用幾分錢種的一棵樹，現在是値多少錢·華北的木材一向是來自菲島，福建，江西和滿洲各地。近年來因爲交通綫已給戰爭之神打斷了，外來的木材極不容易，只有滿洲方面還可以接濟一些。然而這幾年華北的建築增加得很多，而一般富豪之家也不知道什麼綠故總是寧可把存款化作四合大院，結果需要增高，來路缺乏，而一些先前所存的木材也就隨之大形增價了。現在是連一塊玻璃框所用的紅木也已貴到聯鈔四十元。還有一個有趣的情形，就是年來因爲食糧價格的猛漲，一般直接間接餓死的人也算不少。死亡率的增加又反映在壽木的價格上，結果就通最最低等的壽木也得化上四五百元聯鈔。昨日記者坐在洋車上和洋軍夫談天，他就說了一句有趣的話：「　先生以爲咱們沒有飯吃餓死就得了嗎？死還死不起哩。最便宜的棺材板也得四五百塊，這可從那兒來？」（一月二十二日寄）</p>

<h3>中日應推誠提携促進大東亞興隆山　本次官答赤松議員質問</h3>
<p>東京三日中央社電日貴族院本日未召開全體會議，上午十時召開預算總會，育英法院安委員會，十一時舉行所得稅法案委員會，下午一時召開决算委員會，一時半召開赤字法案委員會。衆議院本日下午一時召開全體會議，通過訴訟費用及朝鮮私鐵等七件。華北開發及預備金支出承諾案等及特別建設案，確保水產物之增產，確立海外同晌補助資金制度，治安及確立有利之國策等三件。</p>
<p>東京三日中央社電日大東亞省山木次官，於三日之衆院决算委員會席問，答覆議員田中伊丁郎所問「大東亞縱實鐵道數設計劃」一點，其大意如次：大東亞之經營上强化交通機關，造成一大東亞之大動脈，實屬必耍，政府基地此點，早有計劃，並實施充分之調查，尤其對於海運方面，更爲各方所痛感切要者。試觀關係各國家爲期振興產業之開發，或運輸力之增强，亦正作與日本相同之考慮，日政府爲與各方面作緊密聯絡，現正本此目的推進諸施策。至其具體情形，尙難奉告，但現較去年已有所進展，實可欣慰者。</p>
<p>東京三日中央社電</p>
<p>日衆院决算委員會，於三日開會時，議負赤松寅七質問：　日對華新政策，對中國一般人民及旅華日僑有何影饗？　華北治安，糧食及物價問題如何？當由大東亞省山本次官答以中國一般民衆，今對日本對華新政策，已完全理解，並各就本位與日木協力，治安之維持及糧食問題，自安定民生上觀之，均爲當前之急務，國民政府對此已作莫大之努力，至解决物價問題之關鍵，厥在發展輕工業，謀都會與農存物資交流之圓滑。山本次官答復誌後：</p>
<p>中日關係　更　明確</p>
<p>去年一月對華實施新政策以來，日本方面即逐次實行交還租界，撤廢治外法權，故中國一般民衆已次第明瞭日方之道義立場。按中國政府當局及知識偕級，漸次已澈底明瞭日本本意，至一般民衆，因處戰時下，在生活之安定上或受有威脅及制約一，但尙未遭受直接影響，且日本對於條約上所約定者，如租界交還，廢除治外法權等均着着付諸實行，日方此種誠意，中國方面已漸次明暸，最近中國民衆信賴日木價意之情禇更高。自去年十月底中·日同盟條約締結以後，日本對華關係，更趨明確，自大東亞共同宜言發表後，日木之　意，已表明於大東亞各國乃至世界，今後對一般民衆之影饗極大。治外法　之撤廢及租界之交還，實使中國民衆受相當之影饗，已自上述，又在華日人，其將已徹底明瞭日本對華新政策之意養，及至今日，更澈底暸解，中·日兩國尤應推誠提撓，以期促進中日關係及大東亞之興隆，此非與過去英·美之欺騙政策同，更非日本謀獨佔任何利益者，係處於平等之立塲，互相尊敬，以增進雙方友情也。</p>
<p>雙方努力　確立治安</p>
<p>中日兩國當局，刻正致最大之努力，從事洽安之確立，尤以日軍方面，對此倍加努力。食糧問題，由安定民生，維持治安，增强戰力，開發資源問題，解决食糧問題，實爲最重要者，故現在正盡量以食糧之自給自足爲目標，實施各種增產計劃，並澈底辦理收買等具體辦一法。同時，盡量由滿洲或南方各地輸入食糧，至華北農業實况，如農田水利之設施優良，種子之普及，耕種方法之改善，虫病害之防禦及技術人員之培養等，均作相當之努力。其中成績最著者，爲鑒井蓋該項方法自二三年前即獎勵鑒井，同時並推進改良土質，至最近雖有肥料種子缺乏現象，但其大部仍能足用。此外如運河之開濬，植木事業之興建等，亦均爲增產食糧而着手者，國民政府本此食糧增產要綱，更發起增產運動，最近並由日本敦聖那須博士等專門人才研究一切實際上之諸問題。其他如湖沿之開拓，鹹性地之開墾等，亦均當以確立治安爲其主張。</p>
<p>輸入食糧　抑平物價</p>
<p>以言由滿洲國輸入食糧問題，今年巳樹立較去年增加相當數量之計劃，即由南方各地輸入之食糧，亦有相當計劃，至（物價問題」，自戰爭發生後，由於外來物　輸入之杜絕及受世界經濟之影響，故物價有顯著之高漲，然國民政府正傾其全力，施行各種方策，抑止物價之昂騰，努力確立公正價格。至增加生產方面，其主要者在求使輕工業等盛量交由中國方面經營，又物資之收買，由於物資之一不足，實難順利進行，但見及物資之重要性，自去年實行棉紗，棉布之收買，輕工業品之火柴，　　等日用必需品，乃鄉問所不可缺者，故必須實施增產，以期鄉村與都市物資交流之圓滑。且此尙爲解决物價問題之一重要關鍵，中國方面現亦本此方針，繼續努力中。總之善於目下時局，增强戰力厥在中日兩國之積極協力也。</p>
<h3>緬甸北部日軍屢施反攻　斯蒂威爾承認作戰困難</h3>
<p>里斯本三日中央社電駐印渝軍受美軍之驅使，刻正建設代替細甸公路之新公路，企圖開往夫先地帶，但時遭日軍攻擊，受創甚重，美駐印軍司令斯蒂威爾亦承認日軍之反攻頑强，一日指出該方作戰之困難稱；夫公溪谷淪軍企岡開往緬甸北部，日軍則力阻淪軍建設新公路，其反擊頗爲熾烈·作戰次數雖不及歐洲之多，但若以地形與密林之困難而觀，則該地之作戰可謂極其熾烈。</p>
<h3>日本決戰下人口問題　小泉厚相答議員質詞</h3>
<p>東京三日中央社電　日衆院勞動者年金保險委員會，於三日下午開會，議員山崎常吉質問决戰下之人口問題如何？常由小泉厚相答覆如次二日本人口之增殖，殊爲迅速，刻已引起世界人士之注視。戰爭開始以來，在第四年，第五年問，人口減少，此爲外國人所深信者，但日木在中。日事變發生以後之第四年及第五年，出生率約有二百二十萬，自然增加超過一百萬，至今日木方而有二次係超過一百萬者，但一百萬以上之內然增加，宮爲他國所莫及者，誠覺告慰。今日之人口趨勢，大體如此，若將人口之搆成分男女年齡之種別圖，則構金字塔聖人口圖可以示之。反之，美國（述同黑人）其人口增殖之基礎，極爲焦急，由前年起，其基礎已每况愈下，白人人口方而尤爲顯著，英人身體不逞，呈現小中部肥胖成一酒壺形。德國人口之基礎，亦受世界大戰之影饗，然自國社黨秉政之十三年以來一，由於極力推進人口政策，其資勢已有相當改善，但在此次大戰中，德人自去年以來，即與蘇聯人具有回樣之缺點。惟日本則並未受此種影響，但中。日事變以來，靑壯年出征之影嚮，不僅現在，即將來亦將成極大問題，此尤　從各方面　求對策也。</p>
<h3>對在華帝敵國人日待遇優厚</h3>
<p>東京三日中央社電日衆議院一日舉行决算委員會席間，議員出中藤作氏會質問日本在中國扣留之敵國人待遇。（按田一中氏去秋會赴華視察各敵國人收容所，較之敵國對被扣留日人之待遇是否優善）常由山本次官答覆謂，對在中國所扣留之敵國人待過，最初未採取集團生活方式，但自去年一月起亦漸漸　施集團生活方式，關於敵國待過被扣日僑之具體辦法尙未調查，在某一部門方面，我方待遇在華被扣敵國人或較優於敵國待遇被扣日僑者、然今日政府鑒於當前之時局，對於待遇敵國人正加以愼重考盧、傳不致影饗在外被扣日僑，使敵方知我日木乃一正義我之國際也。</p>

<h3>印獨立氣暈高張英焦急不安　謀略宣傳徒見心勞日拙</h3>
<p>中央社滬訊反軸心方面自去年以來，不時宣傳戰後經營問題，其目的乃在企圖誘致歐洲方面之中立國，為英美獨擅之陰險謀略，尤其此項戰後經營，以反軸心之戰勝為前提，任意作利已宣傳，使　　真實內容者，為止匿笑不已。英美具有誘致弱小中立國拉入自己陣營之野心，企圖不流血而減輕對軸心國之戰鬥負擔，此觀於前此之莫斯科三國外長會議，高列渝方之名以福使其從事對日抗戰，即可明瞭。最近英又對外宣傳戰後印度問題益為明顯，蓋據二十七日華盛頓電，該日駐美英大使哈里法克斯在美國地理協會演說稱。英國對於戰後印度，希學能與英帝國絕綠一節，决不加以妨害云云·常茲緬甸戰事一蹶不振，　印度獨立政府已告樹立之際，哈里法克斯之此項發表，决不能予印度以任何反巒。且印度久受英國壓迫，目前又發生向所未有之飢荒，英國仍未能採取任何具體有效措置，故印度人民鑒於其柔弱無倫狀態，早已不能加以置信，此項言論在主觀方面不外自認絕無救濟印度能力，企圖逃避實任。客觀方面實爲鑒於印度獨立氣運極爲澎湃，無法抑制，深恐將來報仇，乃預作及早退避。在印度風雲日緊之目前，英國之焦急更甚，為防範一起見，特派英屬西非洲之國境兵一隊進駐印度。據其宜傳，非洲國境兵爲世界第一之森林戰土，英國特對此項國境兵施以數個月之義林生活，以證明其優秀性，然此項類似禽獸之非洲兵，今後果能發揮如何戰果，誠可拭目以待·惟所不容忽視者，乃英國常進行種種謀略與宜傳，驅使有色人種以與日軍對抗，自身則企圖避免戰爭也。</p>
<h3>邱吉爾警告國人</h3>
<p>里斯木三日中央社電據倫敦訊：英首相邱吉爾於致柏萊頓選區之候選人函中，對國人警告，勿抱毫無根據之樂觀，並對英各方所恃之處浮不實信念，以爲戰爭結東之旦已在目前，加以警惕·消息靈通人士認此爲極合時機之醫告，設一旦第二戰綫發動劇烈大戰，自在意料中，英人應更爲善自準備，以應付在歷史上最大最險戰爭中之　撼犧牲及死傷。</p>

<h3>德軍抵抗猛烈羅馬可聞炮聲　雙方兵力達廿五萬人</h3>
<p>羅馬三日中央社電　海通社特派員維爾墨倫本日稱：羅馬所聞之砲聲愈響，可見戰綫業巳不遠，自星期二起，即反軸心軍在納吐諾登陸後之第十一日，在戶內亦可聞德軍及反軸心軍雙方之砲聲隆隆，但戰事雖巳迫近，但羅馬之外狀無甚變動。</p>
<p>里斯本三日中央社電　反軸心軍在納吐諾登陸迄今已十日，戰事似益　於激烈，據德軍前綫報道稱，反軸心軍會動員七十五萬噸船舶，集結兵員·坦克車·火砲·子彈·燃料·食糧等於納吐諾橋頭堡，德軍亦同時陸續增强，現在兩軍對峙之總合兵力約達二十五萬人。德軍當局亦承認此地正面之反軸心軍實力優厚，凱塞林元帥亦以可驚之敏捷，增強納吐諾之包　　環，大戰刻下在安奇奧至羅馬之最短路上，進　之主要兵力為美軍部隊。據路透社稱，其先鋒已抵距羅馬僅十二哩之堪依　奈，德軍正痛烈襲擊中。在齊斯迭那南方戰鬥亦甚熾烈有力之德坦克車隊頗為活　。反軸心軍之艦炮射擊，據稱業有停止之勢，由此可知登陸工作似已完畢，戰場已移至艦炮射擊圈外。據美聯社宣稱：卡西諾戰區之美第五軍部隊，在數哩之斯塔夫綫上正行突破進攻，而德軍則仍據卡西諾市北方數哩之山岳陣地勇猛抵抗。</p>
<h3>義波倫亞城遭恐怖空襲</h3>
<p>柏林三日中央社電據羅馬來電稱：反軸心空軍一日又對波倫亞市施恐怖轟炸，市民死傷頗衆，住宅區大受損書，波倫亞大學前校舍·布爾卡里敎會均遭破壞，聖鳩宛尼教會圣彼得羅寺院等亦遭大損害。</p>
<h3>西班牙表示決維護中立　英美擬續施壓迫</h3>
<p>瑪德里三日中央社電　據海通社訊：法倫琪黨機關一阿里巴報」昨力言西班牙抱有「以任何代價一嚴守中立之決心。略謂，反軸心圖所施之經濟壓力，如禁運油類至西班牙等，決不能使西班牙放棄其嚴守中立之政策。西國已準備應付新局面，並謀征服禁運油類所起之難題。西班牙人民或願以任何代價，保持國家之完整，故皆能忍受加於彼等之限制。吾人深信西班牙與交戰國之間，尙無不能遵循正常外交途徑解決之問題。該報未謂，倔強如西班牙之友誼，決非以成　手段所能獲得。</p>
<p>里斯本散日中央社電據美國合衆社倫教消息：倫敦負責方面頗相信謠傳西班牙即將與軸心絕交，但亦相信弗朗哥將軍或因遭英美之以停供食糧及煤油為威爾而被迫辭職。英外交人員預期外相艾登不久將在下議院陳述英美是否將繼續壓迫，以使弗朗哥放棄其中立政策而興反軸心聯合，或另組英美可以操縱之政府</p>
<h3>蘇聯國防外交採地方權制　此舉實具有兩大意義</h3>
<p>莫斯科三日中央社電　蘇聯外交人民委員會委員莫洛托夫，一日出席第十屆最高會議，詳細說明聯邦加盟各共和國中創設國防外務委員會一案之理由，請求通過，經大會討論歷四小時始一致通過。從此聯邦各共和國均有獨立之外交委員會，有自作主張與各外國樹立外交關係締結條約之權限，且有獨立建軍及退出蘇聯聯邦之自由，此舉頗有將一九三六年十二月制定之斯達林憲法中第十四·十七·十八各條加以修正之意</p>
<p>柏林三日中央社電蘇聯外務人民委員莫洛托夫，一日於最高會議席上，闡明賦與聯邦共和國國防　外交權之新方針，至說明蘇軍正為解放玻羅的海三國（愛沙尼亞·拉脫維亞·立陶宛）及蒙特維亞共和國而戰，蘇聯此舉具有兩大意義，一表示聯邦之結構發生劃期變化二，顯露蘇聯有將波羅的海三國以及具奈斯亡命政權之捷克斯拉伐克（該政權曾與蘇聯締結二十年相互援助條約）亦行編入領內之企圖，從此聯邦各共和國得有較　日遠為廣泛之權限，從此更可洞悉蘇聯政府之所以向社會主義色彩之國家聯合熊勢力求發展，實別有野心。莫洛托夫演說中，即顯露蘇聯有將波羅的海三國編入蘇領地之意，蓋該三國曾一度併入蘇聯。至所云蒙特維亞共和國，不外即指貝奈斯爲首領之捷克斯洛伐克，蘇聯欲將從不加入聯邦之捷克斯洛伐克亦行編入北起波羅的海沿岸之波蘭，至捷克斯洛伐克蘇聯亦欲吞併，英美兩國對蘇感情，早因蘇波國境問題而尖銳化，而蘇聯此舉對於英美對蘇感情，當又有相當影響，莫洛托夫氏演說中所言之蘇聯聯邦走向新國家聯合制，實藏有與英美討論之戰後新國際組織作正面衝突之可能，預料英美之對蘇關係，由於蘇聯此舉將益形複雜。</p>
<p>莫洛托夫　演辭要旨</p>
<p>瑞典京城三日中央社電蘇聯官方通訊社機關塔斯社訊：蘇外交人民委員長莫洛托夫在最高會議席上，發表關於改相國防及外交兩委員會之演說，其要旨如次：蘇外長稱，紅軍昔爲蘇聯全國之軍隊，幷非由蘇維埃各共和邦之各別部隊所組成，蘇政府現提議建立蘇聯各共和國之軍隊，以爲紅軍之一部份，故蘇維埃聯邦應設立國防委員會，以適應新組織。在紅軍中雖早已有各民族之部隊之存在，即立陶宛·拉特維亞·愛沙尼亞。喬治亞·亞曼尼亞·及其他之軍隊是也。自今日始，蘇聯之一切人民於紅軍中有其適當之地位，而蘇維埃之立法，早已對徽集各邦籍之軍隊服役幷無限制，但於實行於蘇聯全國徽兵之前，仍有若干時問之躭擱，而蘇人民對紅軍之愛護，在此次戰爭進程中逐漸生長，每人均知紅軍現爲解放立陶宛·拉特維亞·愛沙尼亞·慕爾達維亞·及加萊羅芬蘭共和國而作戰。且紅軍不獨解放本國各民族數百萬人，亦爲民主國家之自由而戰也，憲法之改變，已表示蘇維埃人民之友愛日增，此在東西各國間均視爲蘇聯權威之加强。蘇聯之國際政府關係，向係集中於聯邦之委員會處理，而政府現提議授權於各共和國，使其與外國開闢直接關係，且商訂條約，故蘇維埃各邦均須各自設立外交委員會，而自聯邦委員會改爲各別之外交委員會，蘇聯向以泛斯交關係之意願日漸增長，此不獨蘇聯與歐洲之間有良好之關係，且與美國亦保持良好友誼。論及蘇捷公約時，蘇外長謂，此爲蘇聯與歐洲各國關係總續增進之證明，而爲蘇聯與民主國之間樹立戰後合作及保持和平之基礎，論及蘇各邦之國際政治關係之擴展稱，因各邦之經濟及文化之需要，僅泛蘇維埃之海外代表未能使此項需要滿足，而以各邦與外國　立直接關係而為滿足之途徑，而使蘇聯與外國之關係更强。</p>
<p>戰後外交　地位加強</p>
<p>里斯本三日中央社電蘇聯賦與十六共和國外交權後，美國內似亦已起頗大之反響，而竟有主張賦與各洲外交權，俾與蘇聯對抗者。據美聯社莫斯科電稱，蘇聯採此次之措置後，其在歐洲外交之地位將顯著强化，董蘇聯此後不僅能派遺十六代表加入國際聯盟，且於反軸心國召開各　會議時，亦能派遺同數之代表參加，故其影饗極大云。又據美聯社華盛頓電稱，蘇聯此次之措置，主要以英國爲對象。</p>
<h3>愛沙尼亞國境　坦克大會戰　德軍避離戰略成功</h3>
<p>瑞典京城三日中央社電綜合東綫北部戰綫之前綫消息：德軍自肯基塞普市撇退後，尾追德軍進抵盧加河西岸之蘇軍，二日經克羅威　已到達愛沙尼亞國境，刻正沿塔林鐵路之南北，欲一鼓進抵那爾瓦，然德軍正據守蓋基諾市，努力阻止蘇軍，兩軍於愛沙尼亞國境綫上，展開激烈之機械化血戰，該方面戰綫詳細戰况，殆尙未判明·然據合衆社莫期科電稱，於二十四小時內，將有一大事件發生。又以　加為目標，進抵列寗格勒至博斯柯夫公路之蘇軍，於盧加北方四十公里之地芬斯卡亞，已被德軍阻止其前進。又蘇軍自諾伏格勒西方六十公里巴迭卡亞方面之進擊，雖強化對　加之壓迫，然德軍以退避戰法，已避開蘇軍之銳鋒。又蘇軍於伊爾門湖四北地區，欲包圍殲減德軍之企圖似未成功。</p>
<p>時論選擇</p>
<h3>解決中日問題的基礎</h3>
<p>迎接一九四四年爲决戰年的大東亞戰爭，目的在於驅逐百年來桎梏東亞的歐美侵略勢力，奠定各盟邦的眞正獨立自主，以求解放大東亞，然而去年十一月，在各盟邦代表出席參加之下，所發表的大東亞共同宣言，更充分表現了這一戰爭目的的最高原則。與發表這一宣言同時，而父締結了中日同盟條約，即堪稱為大東亞解放關鍵的中日問題處理方案，更明確地加以規定了。</p>
<p>中日的糾葛，遼始於一八七一年的中日條約，和一八七六年的江華條約前後，經甲午中日之　戰，義和團事件，日我戰爭而　　大，竟發展成爲間島問題，法庫門問題，安奉綫問題，南京事件，二十條問題，五四運動等，其間曾反復重演過無數的激烈鬥爭，終於經五　事件和濟南事件，而成爲九一八事變，一二八事變，七七事變，八一三事變。由共對立的鬥學舞台塲而來看，由朝鮮轉到滿洲，再而華北，終於擴展到全中國的領士，所以兩國對立的性質，愈趨激烈。</p>
<p>正如英國藉砲火而强制中國開放門戶一樣，一八四五年，荷蘭的國書，曾預示着日木迫近同樣的危險。明治時代的日本外交重心，就在於如何解除歐美的壓迫，而建設近代化的國家。業已遭受英國的砲火洗禮，而締結了屈辱條約的中國，也在自發地發展着這種要求，太平天國的起義，即是一個最好的例瞪。中日間悠久而可悲的對立，是在歐美先進國的壓迫下，而企岡各自擺脫其壓迫的鬥爭中產生的。中日的對立，其所以成爲內訌，其所以尖銳化者，就是在遠東根深蒂固的歐美特殊權利作祟使然。對於一八七一年的中日交涉，聲稱需要歐美各國的調停，而欲加以千涉。在朝鮮的中日對立，完全是由於英韓，德韓兩項條約非法承認朝鮮爲中國屬地所造成，後來莎皇俄國的南下，更使中日的對立尖銳化了。卡契尼條約，三國干涉，四國借款團陰謀，美國千涉滿洲問題，華盛頓條約，九國公約，國際聯盟，英美經濟援助中國，幣制改革，白銀協定，國共合作等，這一聯事的事件背後，都有干涉遠東的歐美在搗鬼，終於把中日兩大民族，導引到非戰不可的境地。</p>
<p>從這種歷史上的事實看來，中日兩國單純在亞洲內部，相互砍殺撕鬭，是絕對不能解消兩國間的對立的。如不解决操縱亞洲內部的外在勢力，是不可能解决複雜化了的中日對立的。爲了達到這一目的，則非聯合外在勢力所壓迫下的一切東方國家，共同舊鬥不可。</p>
<p>按大東亞宣言所結成的同盟國家，正在進行着的大東亞戰爭，就具有這樣的歷史任務。所以中國問題的解决，以及遠東各國的獨立自主，全都靠這次戰爭的勝利來决定，否則亳無辦法。在迎接這一决戰年的時際，這一點是每個東亞人民應有的覺悟。（大魯譯自一月六日續賣報知）</p>
<h3>國府物價政策的前進</h3>
<p>物個之合理的抑制，係安定民心之要諦，戰時經濟建設的最大課題。另一方面，在促進大束亞交易上，影響於日本决戰經濟者亦不少，是以對其成就，懷有莫大的關心。</p>
<p>國民政府早已企圖從物賣。通貨兩方面推進强力的物價政策，於十三日的中央政治會議上可决戰時物價管理暫行條例案，不日付之實施。該條例係即　情勢之變佔，改訂現行臨時措置，在主要都市設立物價評議委員食，各照當地實情，將自治的權限付諸各地同業公會，使其適常地决定物價，以圖偏處一地的物資圓滑交流，庶可抑制物價。此對安定民心，復興經濟，可望有極大的裨益。</p>
<p>今日華中物價的腦貴，未必由於通貨膨眼所致。事變前，流通於現在儲備券區域的通貨，推定約有七億元。目前，儲備券的發行額，與物價騰貴的比例相較，數額極少。因此，華中的物價騰貴，並不出於通貨的過剩，毋寗可視爲由於物資的不均衡及心理的影響。物資偏在，交流阻　，物價富然膽貴，通貨從而膨眼。此即華中物價騰賣的特質。所以若謂華中物價膽貴係因通貨膨脹，實屬以因爲果。</p>
<p>因是，物價問題的解决，須在物資方面努力。大東亞戰爭勃發前後，上海工部局實施的物價政策，在以米麥等主要食品爲對象的分野，固然奏效，然在一般物價的統制上，仍無多大成就，其主要原因厥在僅僅指定公定價格，而未調節供求關係，即對於抑制物價未行釜底抽新的方法。如今從外部輸入移入物資益告困難之時，偏處各地的物資，更須求莫交流圓滑。物資的交流如果圓滑，同時可以刺激生產，間接增大通貨的力量，新中國的經濟顯然可以回復其安定。</p>
<p>物價政策祇有從物資與通貨兩方面綜合地普滬地推進，始能產生效果。但此事非政府獨力所能做到，必須民問密切協力。這次公佈的條例，給與各地同業公會以自治的權限，俾令傾其創意與熱悄，實爲物價政策已前進一步的表現，諒必可有莫大的期待。（吉：譯自一月十六日朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>熟水業公會呈請寬限用水量　請予轉飭水廠以維營業</h3>
<p>自法商水電公司於一月份起實施水電用量後，該區內全體熟水店，均因超越自來水用量，以致都被處罰。上海特別市熟水　同業公會，　根據同業會員呈請，擬於今日呈轉上海特別市糧食局，社會福利局，暨第一區公署經濟處，要求轉飭法商自來水公司於本月份起取銷熟水店自來水用量，以便繼績營業。茲將原文錄誌如次：</p>
<p>水店用量　向較浩繁</p>
<p>一案據興　。一樂　等會員同業聯名函稱，竊查同業商號素以經售熱水爲主要營業，平日所需原料，則爲自來水與烟煤　，煤渣三種。滬因受時局影　煤斤來源欠暢，同業處境巳感極度困難，不意法商自來水公司復於本年一月份起，限制水常用量，同業開訊，無異晴天霹露。查熟水店平日用水量，向較各用戶浩繁。</p>
<p>應予特別　寬限用量</p>
<p>際斯煤荒木　，市民需用熟水激增之時，倘熟水店按月用水量與屆民同等待遇，全體同榮，勢將被迫停業，屆時四大社會問題，必將接踵發生，影響社會民生至鉅且大。素仰鈞會痛壞在抱，對同業困難，迭經設法解除，爲特聯名呈請，准予轉呈主管常局，體念下情，寬限問業用水量，藉蘇困楚，而維營業等情前來。</p>
<p>轉飭水廠　酌情寬限</p>
<p>據此，查同業等所稱各爵，確屬實情，設或不予救濟，前途詎堪設想，理合具呈鈞局（署）准予顧念商艱，即日轉飭法商自來水公司，酌情寬限熟水店用水量，仰祈鑒核，實爲公德兩便。」昨據上海社記者分向各該熟水店店主方面探悉，據云，本業皆係小本經營，向來頗守法紀，此次奉諭核減售價，雖平價煤未會車到，均唯命是從，但希望當局予以赤誠救濟。</p>

<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>振興輕工業</h3>
<p>東京二日中央社電稱，日靑木大東亞相，二日於貴院預算總會席上，答覆議員坂谷希子　　問時稱：一振與輕工業，亦爲當前急務，蓋欲安定民生，除食糧以外，尙須確保生活必需品，對此日本方面亦决盡最大之努力，協助中國振與輕工業。」</p>
<p>在今年的增產年中而言坩加農工生產，除推進農產物而外，自以振典輕工　爲增產程序中之要國，即以中國的上海而論，雖　稱中國工業活動的中心，可是，由於原料缺乏，動力限制，以及工人食糧問　的種種原因，上海多數廠家，不是停工，便是減工，形成工業萎縮的狀態，以致輕工業日用品之缺乏，乃成爲當然現象；其尤爲嚴重的，則爲失業問題之難於解决，造成祇消費不生產的過剩人口，愈益加重目前的經濟危機。</p>
<p>自生活必需品之缺乏，與無業游民之增加兩點而言，振興輕工業，實爲當前急要的施策，尤其是在今年的增產年中，盟邦日本交還工廠已屆遂步完成的地步，正宜加倍努力於各種輕工業之恢復。至其解救方策，自須仰賴於日方技術上之協力，可是在原料，動力，與工人食糧等等方面，亦同須有賴於盟邦的協力，以賽圓滑推進各種輕工業的復興工作，這也是無可諱言的。</p>
<h3>各商運貨關稅應憑海關估價　商統會通適所屬會員</h3>
<p>全國商業統制總會，特分函日華商各同業聯合會，爲各商運貨報關納稅，應聽憑海關估價，不得以與該會估價不同，發生爭執。查商統會所發許可證上塡寫之貨物價値，常與海關估價不同，以致商人時起爭執，按海關對於持有商統會許可證之貨物，向不問其證上所塡貨値，與海關估價有無高低，祇須查明貨名商標及數量，確與證內所塡相符，即予騐放，故該會所發許可證上塡寫之貨價，有與海關估價不同，各商報稅應　憑海關估價，不得再以與該會塡寫貨價不同，發生爭執。各聯合會奉命後，已通知所屬會員，一體遵照。</p>
<h3>油糧協議會滬會昨成立　目的促進中央集貨</h3>

<h3>海軍</h3>
<p>— 岩田豐雄著洪　羊譯</p>
<p>軍人班（十）</p>
<p>這次騷動，終於傳到了在京　摩長老們的耳中。而長老們巳經向東京當局開始交涉的風說，業傳來了。</p>
<p>眞人終於忍無可忍地寫了一封寄給校長的信。全文現在仍然存留着。總而言之，不過是一封悲憤慷概的信，只有一點，不同其他的請願書的地方，就是向已經失去了校長的一中學生，也表示着同情之意的。我們自己的志願固然一定耍實澈到底，但是失去了「爸爸」的一中學生，也是値得同情的。希望早來一位好的校長—大意是這樣的。</p>
<p>對這一方面用自書包，一方面用黑醫包，隨時隨地要對抗起來的學校，不惜表示同情，這便是眞人是個「好孩子」的證據。他從小學時代，就是這樣的，就是後來他成人之後，仍然是一個大的「好孩子」。可是，他雖然是一個可佩的靑年，却一點沒有所謂偉大的英俊的風度。至少，一直到後來决行大事之前，是誰也沒有注目到他的——</p>
<p>事熊緊急的校長轉任問題，不久也解决了。由於縣知事適宜的措置，而得以留任在二中。全校高揚着歡呼之聲，從那天以後軍人班的人們，又在天高氣爽的秋夜燈火之下，開始他們的用功了。</p>
<p>（十一）</p>
<p>最後的難關，終於迫近了。在健兒舍輪講義士傳的時候，鹿兒島地方也是非常的寒冷。從那天晚上，到海軍兵學校的學科考試，只剩不到十天的工夫了。</p>
<p>佩人在那二樓像堆房似的小屋中，用功到深夜裹。　淡的電燈，書桌上雖是亮的，但是，眞一郞兄在家時掛在壁上的，西鄉南洲肖像的額面，連眉目也辨不淸楚。唯有用白紙寫的一必勝」兩個字，還模糊地可以看得出來。</p>
<p>十點過後，姊姊松子拿來了火燄熊熊的火盆和粗茶。「謝謝您，用不着火盆。」他只留下了一杯熱茶。這地方的風習，男孩子本來是不烤火盆的，可是近來也漸漸地廢掉了。</p>
<p>體格檢查的時候，已竟淘汰了一半，學科考試時大部分的人都要落選的。無論怎樣的秀才，對這考試，也沒有自信。眞人唯有徬徨於「盡人事而待天命」的大西鄉主義。和「斷而行之，鬼神避之」的菊池少佐主義之間，結局，還得坐在書桌面前去用功。</p>
<p>十二月二十日那天，終於到了。試塲是在偵人母校的購堂。</p>
<p>第一日；代數，英語。第二日：幾何，物理，化學。第三日：日本歷史，日文，漢文，作文。第四日：口試。</p>
<p>第一日的前夜，故意地不用功而早睡了。第二天早最，心裏倒覺着很安靜的，趕到學校一看，群集如山的應試者，個個都像是俊秀天才，心裹漸漸地感到了不安。不久，依者試官的命令，進考試塲，找到在自己的號碼的書桌上，有自己的半身照片，和覆着的考試問題的紙張。待大家都坐下，塲內沉靜的時候。</p>
<p>「開始！」下了這樣一個大聲的號令。這個聲音在佩人的心中，碎然一聲的反響着，他的脈搏也亂跳着，一邊聰着自己的心臟的跳動的聲晋，將者試問題的紙翻過來了。</p>
<p>午前的英語，午後的代數—都是自己得意的學科，但是到現在也不得意了。他唯有專心一志地寫着答案。</p>
<p>「考試成績特別不良時，停止今後的應試。」志願者須知裏，這樣寫着。每天的成績，就在當天發表。</p>
<p>眞人同軍人班的朋友們，那天傍晚，都到揚示板去看了。唯有眞人同熊澤的號碼，沒被紅綫劃去。</p>
<p>第二日·也安然地過去了。第三日，也好容易地過去了。第四日，是口試，這倒很容易。那天晚上眞人好像吃醉酒的人似的，倒在床上就入了夢鄉。</p>

<h3>整頓保甲自警制</h3>
<p>— 東來</p>
<p>所謂保甲自警團，本為民衆自治自衛的一種良好辦法，辦理而得其當，則政府民衆，兩得其利；辦理而不得其當，則便　發生流弊，這當然不是政府辦保甲自警團之初衷了。</p>
<p>上海辦理保甲自警團，也巳有兩年了。雖然不能說有偉大的表現，但帮助警力不足之處，却也隨處可以到見。不過。對於自警團之站崗問題，却也有着不少的怨聲。這不能不責之一部保甲長之缺乏知識，狐假虎威，所以對於現在的保甲長，還得加以嚴格的甄別一下，去其腐化份子，與以精密的訓練，則怨聲可息，而自警團力量之發展，自然益加偉大，這點，執政當局，宜當加以注意的。</p>
<p>現在百物飛漲的時候，除了投機的暴發戶之外，誰不感受痛苦。民衆為了生活的掙扎，不得不努力於自身的工作，以冀獲得生活的維持。可是，為了站崗問題，强迫其暫時的輟業，使其收入上受到相當的影響，這决不是一種政府的良好制度。古者春蒐夏苗秋　冬狩，皆於農　以講事，此種用意甚佳，就是使民衆不妨礙其生產也。現在强迫民衆於聯業時間去作自警團之服務，已經違反了先王的古訓。民衆因了不得巳之苦衷而商之於保甲長，而保甲長之腐化者，並不遵照政府之意旨，　情度理紛呈予民衆以一種相當的便利。比方，有人日　間在外服務的，硬派其在日間値崗，有人在晚間有工作者，又硬派其在晚間値崗，一若彼之命令，絕無相商之餘地者。他們所以如此，目的是在乘機敲詐，迫出錢僱人代崗而巳。根據政府之規定，凡公務員醫生敎員學生，可以免除自警團之服役，可是遵令而行者果亦有人，藐視功令者實亦不少。凡此均望負責當局加以切實整頓，則民幸甚！</p>

<h3>Japan's Inevitable Victory Parliament</h3>
<p>Since the resumption of the 84th Japanese Parliament on the 21st of last month, heated deliberations have been underway to consolidate the total power of 100 million Japanese citizens and fulfill the mission of a decisive victory. Currently, the budget for ensuring "decisive victory" and various important bills necessary for achieving victory have largely been passed by the parliament. It is expected that after this parliamentary session, following the guidance of the "Resolution to Decisively Win with Consolidated Imperial Belief," it will be possible to further unite the total power of Japan and other East Asian nations to achieve a complete victory in the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>In this Japanese Parliament, apart from the budget and diplomatic issues, the most noteworthy points for East Asian nations, especially China in its second year of participation in the war, are primarily related to increasing military production. Prime Minister Tojo stated in his policy address that the strengthening of air power has already reached more than double that of last year, and further production increases are planned; the highest technology and efficiency of Japan's textile industry will be transferred to the aircraft industry. This is entirely in response to the urgent needs of the decisive phase of the Greater East Asia War, as achieving air supremacy is essential to complete the war, allowing for the relentless annihilation of the enemy. This parliamentary session will deliberate on enhancing strategic materials and improving the production system, determining the materials plan for this year. Our China has designated this year as a year of increased production, and its goals should naturally align with the needs of the Greater East Asia War. How to advance our country's industry towards increased efficiency and rational planning under the demands of national defense should be a matter of urgent attention for both the government and the public.</p>
<p>Ensuring the supply of essential food and stabilizing the lives of the people are the foundation of strengthening combat capabilities, making it a central issue of this Japanese Parliament. This year, Japan can ensure an adequate supply of essential food, and Minister of Agriculture and Commerce Yamazaki has announced a food production increase plan, which by the year Showa 21 (Republic of China year 35), including Japan proper, Korea, and Taiwan, rice production will increase by nine million koku compared to the past. Furthermore, the parliamentary report revealed that Manchuria had an exceptionally abundant harvest last year, and the procurement target, as of January 5th, had exceeded the planned amount, so Japan and Manchuria can achieve self-sufficiency in essential food. Our country has always relied on agriculture, but the fish and rice lands of the southeastern provinces have in the past still relied on imported rice, not to mention assisting allied nations with food. However, how to achieve self-sufficiency should be our country's primary task today.</p>
<p>Regarding labor mobilization, encouraging the people to work diligently to complete combat deployment and enhance combat capabilities is, along with the food issue, the focus of Japan's administration this year. Prime Minister Tojo stated clearly in the parliament that the government has full confidence in this, outlining the labor mobilization strategy for this year and unifying the relationship between military and industrial mobilization. Our authorities are vigorously promoting "increased production," but how to mobilize the total power of the people and how to realize a new national wartime life and industrial mobilization are again issues that urgently require the attention of both the government and the public.</p>
<p>From the achievements of this Japanese inevitable victory parliament, we can see that the parliamentarians, bearing the heavy responsibility as representatives of 100 million citizens, enthusiastically put forward proposals and sincerely discussed them, while the government authorities frankly indicated the overall situation, clarified policies, and accepted public opinion, fully demonstrating Japan's concerted effort to advance towards decisive victory. However, looking back at our China, representative bodies have not yet been formally established, and the people's opinions cannot be directly communicated. Compared to our allied nations, we lag behind in mobilizing the masses to cooperate in the decisive battle and in uniting to exert total power. To fulfill our obligations as a participating nation and to adapt to the needs of the decisive battle, how to establish representative bodies as soon as possible, so that officials and the people can work together as one, is something that the government and the public should seriously reflect upon.</p>

<h3>Prices of Major Materials to be Reported Weekly to the Ministry of Industry, Ministry of Industry Orders Various Economic Bureaus to Comply</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Since the promulgation and implementation of the Provisional Regulations for Wartime Price Control, the Ministry of Industry has already instructed various economic bureaus to assess prices for daily necessities and other major materials in accordance with the regulations and strictly comply. In order to supervise its subordinates to actively promote the price policy, it has again telegraphed to the economic bureaus of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hubei, Guangdong, Jiangsu-Huai, and the Jiangxi Construction Office, instructing them to explain the categories and qualities of the assessed prices and market prices of major materials for the previous week each week and submit them by telegram for reference, and to compile and distribute them as reference materials for various places.</p>
<h3>Cultural Circles in the Capital Organize a Cultural Association</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 3rd (Central News Agency) - In order to promote the total cultural power for the decisive battle, the cultural circles in Nanjing have combined various influential cultural organizations to form the Nanjing Cultural Council, which is currently intensifying negotiations to prepare for its establishment. The national bodies participating in this Cultural Council include the Nanjing Literary Research Association, the Jiangnan History and Geography Society, the Zishui Society, the Nanjing Music Association, the Economic Research Association, the Nanjing Broadcasting Drama Troupe, and the recently established Natural Science Research Association, totaling seven national bodies. The Council will be organized by representatives from each association, aiming to establish a powerful force for cultural advancement. The greatest purpose of this Council is to establish close contact with various residents to promote the local decisive battle culture. The individual journals and magazines originally published by various groups will be integrated. The Council will also handle the work of promoting Sino-Japanese cultural exchange with China, and it is expected that various activities after the establishment of the Council will be very active, and its contribution to culture is deeply anticipated.</p>
<h3>US Air Force Arrogance Outrages Chongqing's Military and Civilians, Chongqing Air Force Captain Discusses Recent Developments in Chongqing</h3>
<p>Central News Agency report - A certain captain of the Chongqing Air Force expressed great indignation at the arrogant attitude of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing, which is overbearing and disregards others. He left Kunming at the end of last December to participate in the peace movement. He recently discussed the recent developments in Chongqing in Shanghai as follows:</p>
<p>Chongqing is now completely under the control of the United States, and concerned people are deeply worried about this. For example, a certain Senator Zhang protested to Chiang Kai-shek, finding it difficult to endure the indiscriminate bombing of the US Air Force, especially during the Changde campaign, which caused enormous losses to the Chongqing side. Zhang demanded that the authorities immediately punish the US Air Force and impeach Chongqing's weak attitude. The Chongqing National Defense Supreme Council, fearing the leak of information, detained Zhang. When Chongqing saw its name listed high on the list when the foreign ministers of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union convened a joint declaration in Moscow last October, they were quite pleased. However, this declaration soon became a dead letter, and Chongqing's post-war status was restricted. The pro-German faction in Chongqing had already accused the Moscow conference as a strategy launched by the United States, as the United States has no other way to force Chongqing to resist Japan. Chen Cheng's resignation is widely rumored to be due to dissatisfaction with the tyranny of Britain and the United States, and their contempt for Chongqing. The Chongqing army suffered enormous losses against the Japanese army on the Burmese front. What I consider most virtuous is that the Chongqing Air Force has been subordinated to the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing, almost equivalent to disbanding. The Flying Tigers squadron to which I belonged was absorbed by the mixed brigade led by the United States in early November last year, under the command of Saint Nod, completely losing its autonomy.</p>
<p>Currently, the aircraft and military supplies shipped by the United States to Chongqing are almost entirely used by the US Air Force led by Stilwell and the US Air Force led by Saint Nod. Some are supplied in name only, and their purpose is to attempt to force Chongqing to fight. Recently, Chongqing, under the pretext of recovering Burma, recruited tens of thousands of soldiers to India, which is also one of the American conspiracies. According to senior employees of the Bank of China in Guilin, the soldiers in Changde often behaved fiercely after getting drunk, sometimes even breaking into people's homes and committing indecent acts against women and children, causing the people to hate them to the core. Secondly, what we are dissatisfied with is that the troops in the Lingnan area only know how to be officials and get rich, and they do everything from trafficking opium to defrauding money, without any sense of shame. Chongqing officials often do not have enough office expenses, which makes the soldiers' will to resist the war extremely low. In addition, due to insufficient weapons and the fierce attack by the Japanese army, they are already very afraid of fighting. Therefore, one officer even shrank back from the battle, shooting himself in the arms and legs in an attempt to leave the battlefield and go to the rear for recuperation. Currently, soldiers and officers are skeptical about the future of the war, and lower-level cadres have no combat experience. Desertions are common. When I left Chongqing, I heard that the student conscription plan was being implemented. The Chongqing military service system is very poor in its implementation. Soldiers who desert cannot be recaptured. If the number of deserters is reported to the headquarters, the uniforms must be compensated. Therefore, the current military authorities have adopted espionage methods, that is, as soon as they hear that soldiers have deserted, they immediately imprison their superiors. The citizens of Chongqing are not fully aware of the Greater East Asia War because news is blocked. However, intellectuals generally know that this war will be driven by Britain and the United States, and the result will be their sacrifice.</p>
<h3>Cultural Organizations in North China Preparing to Form a Federation</h3>
<p>Beijing, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The North China Chinese Cultural Construction Association, the North China Writers Association, the Chinese Cultural Association, the Chinese Journalists Association, the North China Fine Arts Association, and the North China Music Association, six cultural national bodies, are preparing to form a cultural organization federation in order to restore and revive Chinese culture. Representatives from various national bodies held a preparatory meeting at the Japanese Alumni Association at 6:00 PM on the 3rd. After consultation, it was decided to invite the China New Drama Association and the China New Fine Arts Association to participate. The organizational rules and content of the cultural organization federation are based on the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, and under the unified ideology, they aim to unite the Chinese cultural circles and create a new path for the cultural circles. The federation's headquarters will be located in Beijing, with branches set up in major cities. The headquarters will have one chairman and one vice-chairman, and three groups will be set up under them: general affairs, planning, and publishing. A general assembly will be held once a year.</p>
<h3>Japanese Naval Air Force Bombards Enemy Convoy, One Large Transport Ship Sunk</h3>
<p>A certain Japanese base in the South Pacific, 3rd (Central Sky News Agency) - On January 31st, the Japanese Naval Air Force discovered an enemy convoy near Finschhafen in New Guinea. They immediately launched a fierce bombing attack, sinking one large transport ship. All Japanese aircraft returned safely.</p>
<p>A certain Japanese base in the Southwest Pacific, 3rd (Central News Agency) - At noon on January 31st, five enemy unified B24 aircraft came to attack Murazaki in the Arafura Sea near the Tanimbar Islands. Japanese naval fighters immediately engaged in combat, shooting down two of them. There were no losses on the Japanese side.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency) - According to reports from San Francisco, the Allied Headquarters in the Southwest Pacific announced that on January 31st, Japanese aircraft bombed US positions at Aro and Gloucester Point in New Britain.</p>

<h3>Economic Trends</h3>
<p>— Yi Ming</p>
<p>Coal Rationing</p>
<p>The price of coal has risen to 260 yuan per ton, and it is still not easy to buy. The authorities are making great efforts to implement rationing. However, the rationing is handled by four coal depots in the suburbs. With three million residents going to four coal depots to buy coal, the congestion is imaginable. However, the time for these four coal depots to sell rationed coal is also limited, only three hours a day. As a result, people make a special trip out of the city, often returning empty-handed. Coal is indeed a problem. The authorities are aware of this situation. Therefore, the authorities are working tirelessly to reach an agreement. In addition to rectifying some unscrupulous merchants, Committee Chairman Wang of the Political Committee, Director Luo of the Public Works Bureau, and Mr. Shirashima, the military administrator of the Mentougou Coal Mine Company, have conducted thorough research and have come up with a solution... Some individual vendors in the Mentougou mine have abandoned their personal sentiments and sacrificed their personal mine interests, joining the unified control association. If this association can operate smoothly and citizens can buy coal at the official price, then the coal problem can be considered to be substantially resolved.</p>
<p>Donation of Old Bronze Ware from the Palace Museum</p>
<p>The copper donation movement has reached its final stage. Each household that has already donated two and a half catties must donate another two and a half catties, and the price of scrap copper on the street has soared. Seven or eight yuan can only buy fifty or sixty old copper coins, and most of the copper door knockers in homes have also been removed to make up the number. The most interesting thing is that Director Zhu of the Palace Museum also ordered employees to collect 2,095 catties of scrap copper stored in the museum and sent personnel to donate it to the authorities in a grand manner. According to reports, the copper is unnumbered scrap copper pieces and copperware stored in various places in the museum, which have nothing to do with historical relics.</p>
<p>In wartime, the implementation of controlled economy is the most natural thing. However, because Chinese people have always been scattered and unorganized, they are very unaccustomed to economic control, so it is not implemented so smoothly. It can be said that it is the trend of events, and recently the people of Beijing have gradually become accustomed to it, so the implementation of various controls has followed one after another. Some time ago, cotton was controlled, and the organization began. Recently, a chemical product control agency has been established. The founding meeting of the North China Chemical Products Control Association was held at the Beijing Hotel. From then on, chemical manufactured products will also be officially included in the scope of control.</p>
<p>It takes ten years to grow trees, but a hundred years to nurture people, which is our country's ancient motto. Growing trees is indeed not easy, but no one thought that a tree planted for a few cents ten years ago is now worth so much money. The timber in North China has always come from the Philippines, Fujian, Jiangxi, and Manchuria. In recent years, because the transportation lines have been cut off by the god of war, it is extremely difficult to get timber from abroad, and only Manchuria can provide some assistance. However, the construction in North China has increased a lot in recent years, and wealthy families always prefer to turn their savings into courtyards for some reason. As a result, demand has increased, the supply route is lacking, and some of the timber previously stored has greatly increased in price. Now, even the mahogany used for a piece of glass frame costs forty yuan. There is also an interesting situation, that is, in recent years, due to the sharp rise in food prices, quite a few people have died directly or indirectly from starvation. The increase in the mortality rate is also reflected in the price of coffins, and even the lowest-grade coffin must cost four to five hundred yuan. Yesterday, the reporter was sitting in a rickshaw and talking to a foreign soldier, who said an interesting thing: "Sir, do you think we can just starve to death if we don't have food to eat? We can't even afford to die. The cheapest coffin board costs four or five hundred yuan. Where can we get that from?" (Sent on January 22)</p>

<h3>China and Japan Should Sincerely Cooperate to Promote the Prosperity of Greater East Asia, Vice Minister Answers Question from Representative Akamatsu</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The Japanese House of Peers did not hold a plenary session today. The Budget General Meeting and the Yuiku Houin Security Committee were held at 10:00 AM, the Income Tax Law Bill Committee was held at 11:00 AM, the Settlement Committee was held at 1:00 PM in the afternoon, and the Deficit Bill Committee was held at 1:30 PM. The House of Representatives held a plenary session at 1:00 PM this afternoon, passing seven items including litigation costs and Korean private railways. The North China Development and Reserve Fund Expenditure Commitment Case, etc., and the Special Construction Case, ensuring the increase in aquatic products, establishing the overseas fellowship subsidy fund system, security, and establishing three favorable national policies, etc.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Vice Minister Yamaki of the Japanese Ministry of Greater East Asia answered the question of Representative Tanaka Itoichiro regarding the "Greater East Asia Vertical Railway Construction Plan" at the House of Representatives Settlement Committee on the 3rd. The gist is as follows: Strengthening transportation facilities in the management of Greater East Asia and creating a great artery for Greater East Asia is essential. The government has had a plan for this point for a long time and has implemented sufficient investigations. Especially in the field of maritime transport, it is more urgently felt by all parties. Looking at the countries concerned, in order to promote industrial development or increase transportation capacity, they are also considering the same as Japan. The Japanese government is currently promoting various measures to this end in close liaison with all parties. As for the specific situation, it is difficult to report, but it has made more progress this year than last year, which is gratifying.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>When the Japanese House of Representatives Settlement Committee met on the 3rd, it discussed the question of Akamatsu Torashichi: What impact does Japan's new policy toward China have on the general public of China and Japanese residents in China? What about the security, food, and price issues in North China? Vice Minister Yamaki of the Greater East Asia Ministry answered that the general public of China now fully understands Japan's new policy toward China and is cooperating with Japan in their respective positions. The maintenance of security and the food problem are both urgent tasks from the perspective of stabilizing people's livelihoods. The National Government has made great efforts in this regard. The key to solving the price problem lies in the development of light industry and the smooth exchange of materials between cities and agricultural areas. Vice Minister Yamaki answered as follows:</p>
<p>China-Japan Relations Are Clearer</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the new policy toward China last January, Japan has gradually implemented the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritoriality, so the general public of China has gradually understood Japan's position of righteousness. According to the Chinese government authorities and intellectuals, they have gradually thoroughly understood Japan's true intentions. As for the general public, because they are in wartime, their lives may be threatened and restricted to a certain extent, but they have not been directly affected. Moreover, Japan has been implementing what is agreed upon in the treaties, such as the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritoriality. The Chinese side has gradually understood Japan's sincerity in this regard. Recently, the Chinese people's trust in Japan's intentions has increased even more. Since the conclusion of the China-Japan Alliance Treaty at the end of last October, Japan's relations with China have become clearer. Since the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration was issued, Japan's intentions have been expressed to the countries of Greater East Asia and the world. In the future, the impact on the general public will be great. The abolition of extraterritoriality and the return of concessions have had a considerable impact on the Chinese people. The Japanese in China have also thoroughly understood the significance of Japan's new policy toward China, and to this day, they have a more thorough understanding. China and Japan should sincerely cooperate to promote the relationship between China and Japan and the prosperity of Greater East Asia. This is not the same as the deceptive policies of Britain and the United States in the past, nor is it Japan's intention to monopolize any benefits. It is a matter of being on an equal footing and respecting each other to enhance friendship.</p>
<p>Joint Efforts to Establish Security</p>
<p>The Chinese and Japanese authorities are currently making the greatest efforts to establish security. The Japanese military is making even greater efforts in this regard. From the perspective of stabilizing people's livelihoods, maintaining security, enhancing combat capabilities, and developing resources, solving the food problem is the most important thing. Therefore, we are now aiming to achieve self-sufficiency in food as much as possible and are implementing various production increase plans, as well as thoroughly handling specific purchase methods. At the same time, we are importing as much food as possible from Manchuria or various southern regions. Regarding the actual situation of agriculture in North China, considerable efforts are being made in areas such as the improvement of farmland water conservancy facilities, the popularization of seeds, the improvement of cultivation methods, the prevention of insect pests, and the training of technical personnel. The most successful of these is the well-digging method. This method has been encouraged since two or three years ago, and at the same time, the improvement of soil quality has been promoted. Although there has recently been a shortage of fertilizers and seeds, most of them are still sufficient. In addition, the dredging of canals and the construction of tree planting projects are also being started to increase food production. Based on this food production increase outline, the National Government has launched a production increase movement. Recently, Japanese experts such as Dr. Nasu have been studying all practical problems. Other measures such as the development of lake shores and the reclamation of saline land are also being advocated to establish security.</p>
<p>Importing Food to Suppress Prices</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of importing food from Manchuria, a plan has been established this year to increase the amount considerably compared to last year. There are also considerable plans for importing food from various southern regions. Regarding the "price problem," since the outbreak of the war, due to the cessation of imports from abroad and the influence of the world economy, prices have risen significantly. However, the National Government is making every effort to implement various policies to suppress price increases and striving to establish fair prices. Regarding increasing production, the main thing is to seek to have light industries and other industries largely operated by China. Also, regarding the purchase of materials, due to the shortage of materials, it is difficult to proceed smoothly. However, recognizing the importance of materials, the purchase of cotton yarn and cotton cloth was implemented last year. Light industrial products, such as matches, which are daily necessities, are indispensable for rural areas, so production must be increased in order to smooth the exchange of materials between rural and urban areas. This is also an important key to solving the price problem, and the Chinese side is continuing to work hard in this direction. In short, in order to be good at the current situation, increasing combat capabilities lies in the active cooperation between China and Japan.</p>
<h3>Japanese Forces in Northern Burma Repeatedly Launch Counterattacks, Stilwell Admits that Operations are Difficult</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The Chongqing army stationed in India, driven by the US military, is currently building a new highway to replace the Burma Road, attempting to advance to the Fuhsien area, but it is often attacked by the Japanese army and has suffered heavy losses. Stilwell, the commander of the US army stationed in India, also admitted that the Japanese army's counterattacks are tenacious. One day, he pointed out the difficulty of operations in that area, saying: "The Chinese army in the Hukawng Valley is attempting to advance to northern Burma, while the Japanese army is trying to prevent the Chinese army from building a new highway. Their counterattacks are quite fierce. Although the number of operations is not as high as in Europe, considering the difficulties of the terrain and dense forests, the operations in that area can be said to be extremely fierce."</p>
<h3>Japan's Population Problem Under the Decisive Battle: Minister Koizumi's Answer to Congressional Inquiries</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Labor and Pension Insurance Committee of the Japanese House of Representatives held a meeting on the afternoon of the 3rd. Representative Tsunekichi Yamazaki questioned how the population problem would be addressed under the decisive battle. Minister Koizumi replied as follows: The increase in Japan's population is extremely rapid and has already attracted the attention of people around the world. It is widely believed by foreigners that the population will decrease during the fourth and fifth years of the war. However, in Japan, during the fourth and fifth years after the start of the Sino-Japanese Incident, the birth rate was approximately 2.2 million, with a natural increase of over one million. To this day, Japan has exceeded one million in natural increase twice, a feat that is unmatched by other countries, which is truly gratifying. The population trend today is generally like this. If we create a population structure chart based on gender and age, it can be shown as a pyramid-shaped population diagram. Conversely, the foundation of population growth in the United States (including blacks) is extremely alarming. Since the year before last, its foundation has been deteriorating, and this is especially evident among the white population. The English have poor physical condition, appearing as a small, obese middle section, shaped like a wine bottle. The foundation of the German population also suffered from the impact of the World War. However, since the Nazi Party took power thirteen years ago, due to vigorously promoting population policies, the situation has improved considerably. However, during this war, the Germans, since last year, have had the same shortcomings as the Soviets. Only Japan has not been affected by this. However, since the Sino-Japanese Incident, the impact of the youth and prime-age men going to war will not only be a problem now but will also become a major problem in the future. Therefore, we must seek countermeasures from all aspects.</p>
<h3>Generous Treatment of Enemy Nationals in China by Japan</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - During a session of the Budget Committee of the Japanese House of Representatives on the 1st, Representative Sakuzo Ide asked about the treatment of enemy nationals detained by Japan in China. (According to Mr. Ide, who visited various enemy national detention camps in China last autumn, he inquired whether the treatment was more favorable than the treatment of detained Japanese by enemy countries.) Vice-Minister Yamamoto replied that the treatment of enemy nationals detained in China initially did not adopt a group living approach, but since January of last year, a group living approach has gradually been implemented. The specific measures for the treatment of detained Japanese expatriates by enemy countries have not yet been investigated. In some aspects, our treatment of detained enemy nationals in China may be more favorable than the treatment of detained Japanese expatriates by enemy countries. However, the current government, in light of the current situation, is carefully considering the treatment of enemy nationals to avoid affecting Japanese expatriates detained abroad, so that the enemy can know that Japan is a righteous and moral international nation.</p>
<h3>Japanese Government Decides to Establish an Embassy in Croatia</h3>
<p>Zagreb, 3rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - Havas News Agency reports: The Japanese government has decided to establish an embassy in Croatia. The Croatian people expressed their welcome, considering it a new development in Japanese-Croatian relations.</p>
<h3>Head of Overseas Chinese Association Pays Respects to Philippine President</h3>
<p>Manila, 3rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - Since the independence of the Philippines, the Overseas Chinese in Manila, in the name of the Overseas Chinese community, have fully cooperated in the construction of the new Philippine islands. Now, Mr. Xunlai Wu, head of the Philippine Overseas Chinese Association, specially paid respects to Philippine President Laurel on the morning of the 3rd and expressed the determination of the Overseas Chinese to fully cooperate with the Philippine government in all aspects of security, economy, and society in the future.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Cai Pei Makes a Statement</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - Our Ambassador to Japan, Mr. Cai Pei, visited His Imperial Highness Prince Mikasa at his residence at 4:00 PM on the 3rd to express his gratitude. They spoke for a long time before he took his leave. Afterwards, Ambassador Cai Pei made the following statement: When His Imperial Highness Prince Mikasa was serving in the headquarters of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China, he devoted himself to promoting Sino-Japanese friendship and showed the greatest sympathy for our people. Therefore, our government and the public deeply appreciate His Highness's enthusiasm. We are extremely pleased that His Highness has been honorably transferred to become a staff officer in the General Staff Office of the Army. We firmly believe that Sino-Japanese relations will be further promoted in the future, and the Greater East Asia War can be completed at an early date.</p>
<h3>Agricultural Production Increase Conference Scheduled to Be Held</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 3rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Ministry of Food, the Ministry of Construction, and the Ministry of Industry will jointly convene an agricultural production increase conference for various provinces and cities, scheduled to be held at the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association on February 9th and 10th. As the conference is approaching, the three ministries held the first preparatory meeting at the Nanjing Chamber of Commerce on Baixia Road on the afternoon of February 2nd at 3:00 PM. Attendees included Mr. Xiaobiao Yin and Mr. Shian Zhou, Department Directors from the Ministry of Food, Mr. Fusheng Wang, a Technical Supervisor, Mr. Yumin Tong and Mr. Youyi Zhong, Counselors, and Mr. Shouqian Shen, Mr. Qianyuan Guo, and Mr. Zongwen Zou, Section Chiefs. The meeting discussed all preparatory matters and resolved that the opening ceremony would be held on the morning of February 9th, followed by a general meeting from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM. On the morning of February 10th, a review meeting will be held from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM, followed by another general meeting from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM. Representatives from various provinces and cities should report to the preparatory office at the Ministry of Food one day in advance. At that time, the heads of various ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan and senior officials and advisors from allied nations will be invited to provide guidance. This conference will make a significant contribution to the future of agricultural production increase.</p>
<h3>India's Independence Sentiment is Rising, and Britain is Anxious and Uneasy; Strategic Propaganda Only Leads to Mental Fatigue and Ineffectiveness</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Shanghai - Since last year, the anti-Axis powers have been constantly propagating post-war management issues, with the aim of attempting to lure neutral countries in Europe as an insidious strategy solely for the benefit of Britain and the United States. In particular, this post-war management is premised on the victory of the anti-Axis powers, arbitrarily engaging in self-serving propaganda, causing those who understand the true content to secretly laugh. Britain and the United States harbor the ambition to lure weak neutral countries into their own camp, attempting to reduce the burden of fighting against the Axis powers without bloodshed. This can be clearly seen from the previous Moscow Three-Power Foreign Ministers Conference, where the name of Korea was listed to urge it to engage in resistance against Japan. Recently, Britain has been increasingly explicit in its external propaganda regarding the Indian issue after the war. According to a Washington telegram on the 27th, the British Ambassador to the United States, Halifax, stated in a speech at the American Geographical Society that Britain would not interfere with India's desire to sever ties with the British Empire after the war. However, as the situation in the Burma war is deteriorating, and the Provisional Government of Free India has already been established, Halifax's statement cannot provide any reversal for India. Furthermore, India has long suffered from British oppression, and an unprecedented famine is currently occurring. Britain has still failed to take any concrete and effective measures. Therefore, the Indian people, seeing their weak and unparalleled state, have long been unable to trust them. Subjectively, this statement is nothing more than an admission that they have no ability to assist India, attempting to escape their responsibility. Objectively, it is because they recognize that India's independence sentiment is extremely surging and cannot be suppressed, fearing revenge in the future, and thus preparing to retreat early. As the situation in India becomes increasingly tense, Britain's anxiety is even greater. To prevent any uprising, they have specially dispatched a unit of British West African border troops to India. According to their propaganda, the African border troops are the world's best forest warriors. Britain has specially subjected these border troops to several months of jungle living to prove their excellence. However, it remains to be seen how these animal-like African soldiers will perform in the future. What cannot be ignored is that Britain is constantly carrying out various strategies and propaganda, driving people of color to confront the Japanese army, while attempting to avoid war themselves.</p>
<h3>Churchill Warns the Nation</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a report from London: In a letter to the candidate for the Brighton constituency, British Prime Minister Churchill warned the nation not to harbor unfounded optimism and cautioned against unrealistic beliefs in various aspects of Britain's strength, assuming that the end of the war is imminent. Informed sources believe that this is a timely warning. Once the second front launches a fierce battle, it is expected that the British people should better prepare themselves to cope with the shocks, sacrifices, and casualties in the largest and most dangerous war in history.</p>

<h3>Fierce German Resistance, Cannon Fire Heard in Rome; Strength of Both Sides Reaches 250,000</h3>
<p>Rome, 3rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - Havas News Agency Special Correspondent Vilmeron stated today: The sound of cannon fire heard in Rome is getting louder, indicating that the front line is not far away. Since Tuesday, the eleventh day after the anti-Axis forces landed in Anzio, the sound of cannon fire from both the German and anti-Axis forces can be heard indoors. However, although the war has approached, there has not been much change in the external appearance of Rome.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - It has been ten days since the anti-Axis forces landed in Anzio, and the war seems to be intensifying. According to reports from the German front line, the anti-Axis forces have mobilized 750,000 tons of ships, gathering troops, tanks, artillery, bullets, fuel, and food at the Anzio beachhead. The German forces are also continuously reinforcing, and the combined strength of the two armies now facing each other is approximately 250,000. The German authorities also acknowledge that the strength of the anti-Axis forces on this front is substantial. Marshal Kesselring has also reinforced the Anzio encirclement with astonishing agility. The main force advancing on the shortest route between Anzio and Rome is the American troops. According to Reuters, their vanguard has reached Campoleone, only twelve miles from Rome, and is under heavy attack by the German forces. The fighting south of Cisterna is also very fierce, with powerful German tank units being quite active. The naval gun fire from the anti-Axis forces is said to have stopped, indicating that the landing operation seems to have been completed and the battlefield has moved outside the range of naval gun fire. According to the Associated Press: The US Fifth Army units in the Cassino sector are launching a breakthrough attack on the Gustav Line over several miles, while the German forces are still bravely resisting from their mountain positions a few miles north of the city of Cassino.</p>
<h3>Italian City of Bologna Suffers a Horrific Air Raid</h3>
<p>Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a report from Rome: The anti-Axis air force once again carried out a horrific bombing of the city of Bologna on the 1st, causing numerous civilian casualties and extensive damage to residential areas. The former buildings of the University of Bologna and the Burcarli Church were destroyed, and the Church of San Giovanni and the Basilica of San Petronio were also heavily damaged.</p>
<h3>Spain Expresses Determination to Maintain Neutrality; Britain and the United States Plan to Continue Applying Pressure</h3>
<p>Madrid, 3rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to Havas News Agency: The Falangist Party organ "Arriba" forcefully stated yesterday that Spain is determined to strictly adhere to neutrality "at any cost." It stated that the economic pressure exerted by the anti-Axis powers, such as the embargo on oil to Spain, will not cause Spain to abandon its policy of strict neutrality. Spain is prepared to cope with the new situation and is seeking to overcome the difficulties caused by the oil embargo. The Spanish people are willing to maintain the integrity of the country at any cost and can therefore endure the restrictions imposed on them. We firmly believe that there are no problems between Spain and the belligerent nations that cannot be resolved through normal diplomatic channels. The newspaper stated that friendship as strong as Spain's cannot be obtained by coercive means.</p>
<p>Lisbon, Central News Agency, 3rd - According to a United Press International report from London: Responsible circles in London believe in the rumors that Spain is about to sever ties with the Axis powers, but also believe that General Franco may be forced to resign due to the threat of Britain and the United States suspending the supply of food and kerosene. British diplomatic personnel expect Foreign Secretary Eden to soon state in the House of Commons whether Britain and the United States will continue to exert pressure to force Franco to abandon his neutral policy and join the anti-Axis alliance, or form a government that Britain and the United States can control.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Adopts a Local System for National Defense and Foreign Affairs; This Move Has Two Major Implications</h3>
<p>Moscow, 3rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov attended the tenth session of the Supreme Soviet on the 1st, explaining in detail the reasons for creating National Defense and Foreign Affairs Committees in the constituent republics of the Union and requesting its passage. After four hours of discussion, the assembly unanimously passed the resolution. From now on, each republic of the Union will have an independent Foreign Affairs Committee, with the authority to independently establish diplomatic relations with foreign countries and conclude treaties. They will also have the freedom to independently build their armed forces and secede from the Soviet Union. This move seems to revise Articles 14, 17, and 18 of the Stalin Constitution, which was enacted in December 1936.</p>
<p>Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov clarified the new policy of granting defense and diplomatic rights to the federal republics at the Supreme Soviet on the 1st. He explained that the Soviet army is fighting to liberate the three Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania) and the Montville Republic. This move by the Soviet Union has two major implications: first, it indicates a significant change in the structure of the Union; second, it reveals the Soviet Union's intention to incorporate the three Baltic states and Czechoslovakia (whose exiled government had concluded a 20-year mutual assistance treaty with the Soviet Union) into its territory. From now on, the federal republics will have much broader powers than ever before. From this, it can be further discerned that the Soviet government is seeking to develop a coalition with countries with socialist leanings, harboring ulterior motives. In his speech, Molotov revealed the Soviet Union's intention to incorporate the three Baltic states into Soviet territory, as the three countries had once been annexed by the Soviet Union. As for the so-called Montville Republic, it undoubtedly refers to Czechoslovakia, led by Benes. The Soviet Union wants to incorporate even Czechoslovakia, which has never joined the Union, extending from Poland along the Baltic coast to Czechoslovakia. The Soviet Union also wants to annex it. Relations between Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union have already been strained due to the Soviet-Polish border issue, and this move by the Soviet Union will undoubtedly have a considerable impact on British and American feelings towards the Soviet Union. Molotov's speech about the Soviet Union heading towards a new national union system contains the possibility of a head-on collision with the new international organization discussed by Britain and the United States after the war. It is expected that the relations between Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union will become more complicated due to this move by the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Summary of Molotov's Speech</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 3rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - TASS, the official Soviet news agency, reports: Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov delivered a speech on the reorganization of the National Defense and Foreign Affairs Committees at the Supreme Soviet. The main points are as follows: The Soviet Foreign Minister stated that the Red Army was previously the army of the entire Soviet Union and was not composed of separate units from the Soviet republics. The Soviet government now proposes to establish armies for each republic of the Soviet Union as part of the Red Army. Therefore, the Soviet Federation should establish a National Defense Committee to adapt to the new organization. Although there have long been units of various nationalities in the Red Army, such as the Lithuanian, Latvian, Estonian, Georgian, Armenian, and other armies, from today onwards, all people of the Soviet Union have their appropriate place in the Red Army, and Soviet legislation has long imposed no restrictions on the conscription of troops from various states. However, there is still some time before conscription is implemented throughout the Soviet Union. The Soviet people's love for the Red Army has gradually grown during the course of this war, and everyone knows that the Red Army is now fighting to liberate Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Moldova, and the Karelian-Finnish Republic. Furthermore, the Red Army is not only liberating millions of people of its own nationalities but is also fighting for the freedom of democratic countries. The change in the constitution has shown that the friendship of the Soviet people is increasing, which is seen as strengthening the authority of the Soviet Union in both the East and the West. The Soviet Union's international government relations have always been handled centrally by the Federation's committees, and the government now proposes to authorize the republics to open up direct relations with foreign countries and negotiate treaties. Therefore, each Soviet state must establish its own Foreign Affairs Committee, and from the Federation's committees to separate Foreign Affairs Committees, the Soviet Union's desire for Pan-Slavic relations is gradually increasing. Not only does the Soviet Union have good relations with Europe, but it also maintains good friendship with the United States. Discussing the Soviet-Czech Pact, the Soviet Foreign Minister stated that this is proof of the continued improvement of relations between the Soviet Union and European countries and establishes the foundation for post-war cooperation and the maintenance of peace between the Soviet Union and democratic countries. Discussing the expansion of the international political relations of the Soviet states, he stated that due to the economic and cultural needs of each state, the existing Pan-Soviet overseas representatives could not meet these needs. The way to meet them is to establish direct relations between each state and foreign countries, which will strengthen the Soviet Union's relations with foreign countries.</p>
<p>Strengthening the Post-War Diplomatic Position</p>
<p>Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - After the Soviet Union granted diplomatic powers to its sixteen republics, a considerable reaction seems to have arisen within the United States, and some are even advocating granting diplomatic powers to each continent to counter the Soviet Union. According to an Associated Press report from Moscow, after the Soviet Union took this measure, its diplomatic position in Europe will be significantly strengthened. It is believed that the Soviet Union will not only be able to send sixteen representatives to join the League of Nations, but also be able to send the same number of representatives to participate in various anti-Axis conferences, so its impact is extremely great. According to an Associated Press report from Washington, this move by the Soviet Union is mainly aimed at Britain.</p>
<h3>Tank Battle on the Estonian Border; German Army Successfully Avoids Engagement Strategically</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 3rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - Combined front-line news from the northern front of the Eastern Front: After the German army retreated from the city of Kingisepp, the Soviet army, pursuing the German army, arrived at the western bank of the Luga River on the 2nd. Via Klooga, they have reached the Estonian border and are currently attempting to advance to Narva in one fell swoop along the north and south of the Tallinn railway. However, the German army is holding the city of Kehra, making efforts to stop the Soviet army. A fierce mechanized battle is unfolding on the Estonian border. Detailed battle conditions on that front have not yet been determined. However, according to an Associated Press report from Moscow, a major event will occur within 24 hours. Furthermore, the Soviet army, aiming for Luga, has reached the Luga-Pskov highway 40 kilometers north of Luga. They have been stopped by the German army at Finskaya. Furthermore, although the Soviet army's attack from the Padereka area, 60 kilometers west of Novgorod, has strengthened the pressure on Luga, the German army has avoided the sharp edge of the Soviet army by using retreat tactics. Furthermore, the Soviet army's attempt to encircle and annihilate the German army in the area north of Lake Ilmen seems to have failed.</p>

<h3>The Foundation for Resolving the Sino-Japanese Problem</h3>
<p>The Greater East Asia War, welcoming 1944 as the year of the decisive battle, aims to expel the European and American aggression forces that have shackled East Asia for a century and lay the foundation for the true independence and autonomy of each allied nation in order to liberate Greater East Asia. However, the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, which was issued last November with the participation of representatives from each allied nation, more fully expressed the highest principle of this war objective. Simultaneously with the issuance of this declaration, the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty was concluded, which can be regarded as the key to the liberation of Greater East Asia. The solution to the Sino-Japanese problem was more clearly defined.</p>
<p>The entanglement between China and Japan began around the Sino-Japanese Treaty of 1871 and the Ganghwa Treaty of 1876. It grew through the Sino-Japanese War of Jiawu, the Boxer Rebellion, and the Russo-Japanese War, and eventually developed into the Jian Island issue, the Fakumen incident, the Anfeng Railway issue, the Nanjing Incident, the Twenty-One Demands, the May Fourth Movement, etc. Numerous fierce struggles were repeatedly re-enacted. Finally, through the May 30th Incident and the Jinan Incident, it developed into the September 18th Incident, the January 28th Incident, the July 7th Incident, and the August 13th Incident. From the perspective of the stage of mutual opposition and struggle, it shifted from Korea to Manchuria, then to North China, and finally expanded to the entire territory of China, so the nature of the opposition between the two countries became increasingly fierce.</p>
<p>Just as Britain used cannon fire to force China to open its doors, in 1845, the Dutch letter foreshadowed the same impending danger for Japan. The focus of Japanese diplomacy during the Meiji era was on how to lift the oppression of Europe and the United States and build a modernized nation. China, having already suffered from British cannon fire and concluded humiliating treaties, was also spontaneously developing this demand. The Taiping Rebellion is the best example. The long and tragic conflict between China and Japan arose from the struggle of both countries to escape the oppression of advanced European and American countries. The reason why the conflict between China and Japan became infighting and became so acute was the deeply rooted special rights of Europe and the United States in the Far East. For the Sino-Japanese negotiations in 1871, it was claimed that the mediation of European and American countries was needed, and attempts were made to interfere. The Sino-Japanese opposition in Korea was entirely caused by the illegal recognition of Korea as a Chinese territory by the Anglo-Korean and German-Korean treaties. Later, the southward expansion of Tsarist Russia further sharpened the Sino-Japanese opposition. The Kachin Treaty, the Triple Intervention, the conspiracy of the Four-Power Loan Group, the US intervention in the Manchurian issue, the Washington Treaty, the Nine-Power Treaty, the League of Nations, British and American economic aid to China, currency reform, the Silver Agreement, and the Kuomintang-Communist cooperation all had the European and American powers interfering in the Far East behind the scenes, and finally led the two major nations of China and Japan to a point where war was inevitable.</p>
<p>From this historical perspective, it is absolutely impossible for China and Japan to resolve their conflict by simply engaging in mutual killing and fighting within Asia. Unless the external forces manipulating the interior of Asia are resolved, it will not be possible to resolve the complicated Sino-Japanese opposition. In order to achieve this goal, it is necessary to unite all the Eastern countries oppressed by external forces and engage in a common struggle.</p>
<p>The Allied nations formed by the Greater East Asia Declaration are engaged in the Greater East Asia War, which has such a historical mission. Therefore, the resolution of the China issue and the independence and autonomy of the Far Eastern countries all depend on the victory of this war, otherwise there is no solution. On the occasion of welcoming this year of the decisive battle, this is the realization that every East Asian person should have. (Translated by Da Lu from the January 6th sequel to the Yomiuri Hochi)</p>
<h3>The National Government's Price Control Policy Moves Forward</h3>
<p>The reasonable suppression of prices is the key to stabilizing public sentiment and the biggest issue in wartime economic construction. On the other hand, it also significantly affects Japan's war economy in promoting Greater East Asia trade, and great concern is held for its success.</p>
<p>The National Government has long attempted to promote a vigorous price control policy from both the commodity and currency aspects. At the Central Political Conference on the 13th, the "Temporary Regulations for Wartime Price Management" were approved, to be implemented shortly. These regulations are designed to adapt to changing circumstances, revising existing temporary measures, and establishing price review committees in major cities. Each committee will decide prices appropriately based on local conditions, granting autonomous powers to local trade associations to ensure smooth exchange of goods across regions, thereby suppressing prices. This is expected to be of great benefit to stabilizing public sentiment and restoring the economy.</p>
<p>The high prices in Central China today are not necessarily due to currency inflation. Before the war, the currency circulating in the current Reserve Note area was estimated at about 700 million yuan. Currently, the amount of Reserve Notes issued is extremely small compared to the rate of price increases. Therefore, the price increases in Central China are not due to excess currency, but rather can be seen as due to the imbalance of goods and psychological effects. When goods are unevenly distributed and exchanges are obstructed, prices naturally rise, and currency inflates accordingly. This is the characteristic of price increases in Central China. Therefore, to say that price increases in Central China are due to currency inflation is to mistake the cause for the effect.</p>
<p>Therefore, the solution to the price problem requires efforts on the commodity side. Around the time of the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the price control policy implemented by the Shanghai Municipal Council was effective in the area of major foods such as rice and wheat. However, it did not achieve much in the control of general prices. The main reason was that it only specified official prices without regulating supply and demand relationships, that is, it did not take radical measures to suppress prices. Now that it is increasingly difficult to import goods from the outside, the smooth exchange of goods located in various places is even more necessary. If the exchange of goods is smooth, it can also stimulate production and indirectly increase the power of currency. The economy of the New China can obviously return to stability.</p>
<p>Price control policies can only produce effects if they are comprehensively and universally promoted from both the commodity and currency aspects. However, this is not something that the government can do alone. Close cooperation with the people is necessary. The regulations announced this time give local trade associations autonomous powers, allowing them to pour out their creativity and enthusiasm, which is a sign that the price control policy has taken a step forward, and great expectations are likely to be held. (Translated from the Asahi Shimbun, January 16)</p>

<h3>Transport of Rice Flour and Rice Products Limited to Eight Kilograms; Otherwise, Treated as Smuggling of Grain</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports: The Rice and Grain Control Committee believes that rice and grain control is originally intended to regulate the people's food supply. The collection, transportation, and supply should be handled in accordance with the "Provisional Regulations for the Management of Rice Transportation and Sales in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui" promulgated by the central government to maintain the people's food supply and respect the law. It has been found that some merchants and people are manufacturing and transporting large quantities of rice flour and rice products (such as New Year cakes and zongzi) in order to avoid the crackdown on the aforementioned regulations, which has a significant indirect impact on rice and grain control. The matter has been resolved by the third meeting of the committee. In the future, all transports of rice flour and products, regardless of name or purpose, shall be subject to the aforementioned regulations, with a limit of eight kilograms. Exceeding this limit shall be treated as smuggling of grain and shall be cracked down on in accordance with the law. In addition to reporting to the Executive Yuan for record, a letter has also been sent to the municipal government to notify and implement it. The municipal government has approved the letter and notified its subordinates to implement it accordingly.</p>
<p>Meeting Postponed</p>
<p>The Rice and Grain Control Committee, in order to review the past and promote future work, originally scheduled to hold a joint meeting starting on the 7th of this month, with the date scheduled for three days, and the attendees were department heads and above of the committee and the directors of offices in various regions. As the inspection teams dispatched by the committee to various regions recently will not be able to complete their tasks until after one week, and the inspection situation must also be reported in detail before the meeting for reference, the committee has decided to postpone the meeting to February 15. A telegram has been sent to the offices in various regions and a letter has been sent to each attendee.</p>
<h3>Various Tasks in the Eighth District Temporarily Handled by the Original Offices; Announcement to Be Made Separately After Completion of Takeover</h3>
<p>The First and Eighth District Public Offices of this city were formally merged on the 1st of this month. However, various takeover matters still need to be carried out step by step. Therefore, the original tasks of the Eighth District are still temporarily handled by the respective departments of the original office. That is, the issuance of various licenses and the payment of taxes in the Eighth District are currently still handled by the former Finance Office. Merchants and people in the district can still go to the offices that previously handled these matters to apply for tax payment. Once the First District Public Office has completed the takeover, a separate announcement will be made regarding the various methods.</p>
<h3>Fire Departments of Two Districts Merged into One Bureau</h3>
<p>The First and Eighth District Public Offices of this city were formally merged on the 1st of this month. The original fire departments of the two districts have also been merged and renamed the "Fire Department of the First Police Bureau of the Shanghai Special Municipality," under the jurisdiction of the First Police Bureau. The director of the department is Ite Kiyomi, and the deputy directors are Guan Guoliang and Chen Longquan. The director and deputy directors paid a visit to Deputy Director Su yesterday (the 3rd) to inquire about everything.</p>

<h3>January 15 Designated as Shanghai South Recovery Festival</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports: The entire Nanshi area has always been a prosperous commercial area. After the war, the market situation was extremely desolate. The Municipal Administration Bureau comforted the refugees, and eight or nine out of ten civilians returned. In recent years, the commercial market has improved daily, and industry and commerce have become particularly prosperous. The Shanghai South Citizens' Welfare Association is responsible for promoting the social welfare of the district. It is reported that the association has unanimously resolved to designate January 15 of each year as the Shanghai South Citizens' Recovery Festival to commemorate it. Yesterday, a special report was filed with the Seventh District Public Office and the Bureau of Social Welfare for record. Citizens will automatically celebrate at that time.</p>
<h3>26th Period Cigarette Ration Reduced</h3>
<p>Although the rationing association has repeatedly tried to reform the method of cigarette distribution, it has still not been able to get on the right track. Cigarette scalpers continue to be active, and the number of cigarette vendors is increasing daily. Legitimate smokers cannot buy cigarettes, and they all deeply hope that the Bureau can implement proper methods and severely crack down on cigarette vendors. It is reported that the China Tobacco Rationing Association has now started the 26th period cigarette rationing. The rationing quantity of each grade in this period has been reduced. Grade A is 13,671 yuan, 1 jiao and 3 fen; Grade B is 7,165 yuan, 9 jiao and 8 fen; Grade C is 34,241 yuan, 1 jiao and 5 fen; and Grade D is 1,884 yuan, 5 jiao and 5 fen. The price remains unchanged. However, the rationing quantity of cigarettes produced by Yizhong Tobacco Company is small. Grade D can only sell five each of Ying, Wu, and Pinhai per day.</p>
<h3>Assemblies in Urban Areas Must Be Reported in Advance</h3>
<p>The Second Police Bureau of this city, in order to ensure security in the territory, local security, and promote the universal recovery of various industries, yesterday issued a special order to its subordinate branch bureaus and district police bureaus, etc., that in the future, all groups, schools, etc. in each territory should report in advance for record all gatherings, meetings, and sports events. Otherwise, strict crackdowns should be carried out to prevent unscrupulous elements from taking the opportunity to disturb the locality and ensure safety.</p>
<h3>The Boiled Water Industry Association Requests an Extension of Water Usage Limit; Please Forward Instructions to the Water Plant to Maintain Business</h3>
<p>Since the French Concession Water and Electricity Company implemented water and electricity usage limits in January, all boiled water shops in the area have been penalized for exceeding the tap water usage limit. The Shanghai Special Municipality Boiled Water Industry Association, according to the request of its members, plans to forward a report to the Shanghai Special Municipality Food Bureau, Social Welfare Bureau, and Economic Section of the First District Public Office today, requesting that the French Concession Water Company cancel the tap water usage limit for boiled water shops from this month onwards, in order to continue business. The original text is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Water Shop Usage Has Always Been High</p>
<p>According to letters from members such as Xingfa and Yile, "We have found that our businesses primarily sell hot water. The raw materials needed on weekdays are tap water, coal, and coal slag. Shanghai has been affected by the current situation. The source of coal is not smooth, and our situation is extremely difficult. Unexpectedly, the French Concession Water Company has again limited tap water usage starting in January of this year, which is like a bolt from the blue. We have found that the daily water usage of boiled water shops has always been higher than that of other users.</p>
<p>Special Extension of Water Usage Limit Should Be Granted</p>
<p>At a time when there is a coal shortage and the public's need for boiled water is increasing sharply, if the monthly water usage of boiled water shops is treated the same as that of residents, all businesses will be forced to close. At that time, four major social problems will follow, affecting society and the people's livelihood greatly. We have always admired your association for your pain and have repeatedly tried to solve our difficulties. Therefore, we have jointly requested that you forward a report to the competent authorities to understand our situation and extend our water usage limit to alleviate our difficulties and maintain our business."</p>
<p>Forward Instructions to the Water Plant to Consider Granting an Extension</p>
<p>"Based on this, we have found that the claims of the industry are indeed true. If relief is not given, the future is unimaginable. Therefore, we have submitted this report to your bureau (office) to ask you to consider the difficulties of the industry and immediately forward instructions to the French Concession Water Company to consider extending the water usage limit for boiled water shops. We hope that you will approve it, as it will benefit both the public and the industry." Yesterday, a reporter from Shanghai News Agency learned from the owners of the boiled water shops that they are all small businesses that have always abided by the law. Although flat-price coal has not yet arrived, they are following orders. However, they hope that the authorities will provide sincere relief.</p>
<h3>Exhibition of Ancient Porcelain from Past Dynasties to Open Tomorrow Morning</h3>

<h3>Remembering Mr. Shen Meisou's Calligraphy</h3>
<p>— Cai Chengsheng</p>
<p>Mr. Shen Zipei of Jiaxing, also known as Meisou, was well-versed in various books and had a noble character. He was a scholar of the Qing Dynasty. His calligraphy is purely in the square-pen style, strange and unrestrained, like dragons soaring and phoenixes dancing, with thousands of changes, indescribable. Every stroke is a wonderful truth. In one piece, the characters are different in shape and the lines are different in state. They lean left and look up right, bend right and extend left, each to the extreme. He created a strange style that no ancient calligrapher had, and he can be said to surpass the ancients by far, not to mention those who come after. It can be said that his art has reached the point of transformation. Mr. Shen loved to read ancient steles, and he read all the stones with words in history. With extensive research and deep brewing, he was able to gather thousands of changes at the tip of his wrist for his use. In his later years, his calligraphy started with Huang Shizhai, traced back to Zhong Yao and Suo Jing, and incorporated the cursive script of Zhang Zhi, melting them into one furnace, vigorously correcting the rounded, weak, and stereotyped habits of calligraphers in the past. Mr. Shen was a learned man who deeply understood the meaning of "calligraphy values change, not similarity," and he valued individuality and feared dependence, so he was able to form his own style. When he studied Bao Anwu in his middle age, although he got both form and spirit, he was ashamed to be a slave to others, so he only wrote in ordinary letters and colophons, and never made large-scale works. The screens and couplets of Mr. Shen that we usually see almost never have the appearance of Anwu, which is clear evidence. Mr. Shen knew that he would not be able to excel if he did not break through the model of Anwu. Commentators say that Mr. Shen studied Anwu in his middle age and Shizhai in his later years, as if Mr. Shen only learned from one school before reaching this superb level. In fact, Anwu is nothing. In his later years, his learning from Shizhai was only to learn his method, and it cannot be said that he imitated his style. Sha Wenruo Meng Hai, in his "On Calligraphy in the Past Three Hundred Years," said: "... and it is impossible to talk about promoting and expanding it. It was not until the late Qing Dynasty that a master came out, that is, Shen Huizhi... Later, I don't know how he suddenly understood the secret of calligraphy like a Buddhist disciple, and he took Huang Daozhou and Ni Yuanlu as his models in his later years. He did not use the dead ink method of others, but used the skills of these two schools on Zhong Yao and Suo Jing's lifetime, so there were more changes, twists and turns, and strange interests. ..." This is a true statement. To say that Mr. Shen only studied Shizhai is still too shallow to understand Mr. Shen completely. After the change of dynasties, Mr. Shen avoided Shanghai and began to set his price for calligraphy. After only a few years, he passed away, so there are fewer of his works handed down. Now, even a piece of paper or a single word is as precious as a treasure. At the same time as Mr. Shen, there were some who were famous for their calligraphy, and there were many who sought it, but their names disappeared after their death. This is because they were purely stealing fame and had no real learning to last for thousands of years. Only Mr. Shen, in a short period of time, revealed his brilliance and enjoyed his fame alone. It is known that the fame before death is not reliable, and it is by no means a fluke that Mr. Shen enjoys his fame after death. Mr. Shen was ill for more than two months. Ten hours before his death, he was still lucid and wrote several pairs of couplets. His brush was full of ink, and his spirit was full of energy. It was not like the writing of a sick person. His endowment was so great that ordinary people could not reach it. Today, this couplet is still kept by his son, Ci Hu Jun. Famous figures such as Zheng Haizang, Zhu Guwei, and Kang Nanhai, more than thirty people in total, inscribed on the four edges of the couplet, which is truly precious. I love Mr. Shen's calligraphy as much as my life. I have seen a lot of it in the past twenty years, so I will record one or two to tell those who love Mr. Shen's calligraphy.</p>

<h3>Fee Collection Method for Applying for Residence Permits</h3>
<p>There has always been a fee collection method for residents of this city applying for residence permits. It is heard that the Baojia Bureau, in view of the soaring prices and in order to limit re-applications and avoid wasting paper, has submitted a request to the authorities for a slight increase in the amount of fees. The regulations are as follows: Each new residence permit costs 5 yuan in national currency. Each migration and death report costs 5 yuan in national currency. Re-application for a residence permit costs 10 yuan in national currency per card. No other fees will be collected. This method has been implemented since this month.</p>
<h3>Residence Permits for Naturalized Foreigners Issued by the Foreign Affairs Section</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of residence permits for naturalized foreigners, according to news from the Baojia authorities to the Central News Agency reporter, it has been found that naturalized foreigners have obtained Chinese nationality and should be issued the same residence permits as Chinese people to fulfill the reality of naturalization. The Baojia authorities found that the investigation of naturalized foreigners' Baojia affairs has always been handled by the Foreign Affairs Section of the Special Higher Police Department of the First Police Bureau. In order to facilitate the work, in the future, the issuance of residence permits for naturalized foreigners will also be issued by the Foreign Affairs Section of the Special Higher Police Department.</p>

<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3>Revitalizing Light Industry</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency) - It is reported that Japanese Minister for Greater East Asia, Aoki, stated on the 2nd, during the budget meeting of the House of Peers, in response to questions from Assemblyman Sakatani Yuko: "Revitalizing light industry is also an urgent task at present. To stabilize the people's livelihood, in addition to food, it is also necessary to ensure daily necessities. Japan is determined to make its utmost efforts to assist China in revitalizing light industry."</p>
<p>In this year of increased production, in addition to promoting agricultural products, revitalizing light industry is a key step in the increased production process. Taking Shanghai, China, as an example, although it is known as the center of China's industrial activity, many factories in Shanghai have either suspended or reduced production due to a lack of raw materials, power restrictions, and issues with workers' food supplies, resulting in a state of industrial decline. Consequently, the shortage of light industrial daily necessities has become a natural phenomenon. Even more serious is the difficulty in solving the unemployment problem, which creates an overpopulation that only consumes but does not produce, further exacerbating the current economic crisis.</p>
<p>From the perspectives of the shortage of daily necessities and the increase in unemployed vagrants, revitalizing light industry is indeed an urgent policy measure. Especially in this year of increased production, now that the Allied country Japan has begun to return factories in stages, it is appropriate to redouble efforts to restore various light industries. As for the solution, it is necessary to rely on Japan's technical cooperation. However, in terms of raw materials, power, and workers' food supplies, it is also necessary to rely on the cooperation of the Allied countries to smoothly promote the revitalization of various light industries. This is undeniable.</p>
<h3>Customs Duties on Goods Transported by Merchants Should Be Based on Customs Valuation; Business Control Committee Notifies Its Members</h3>
<p>The National Commercial Control General Assembly has specifically written to the Joint Association of Japanese and Chinese Merchants, stating that customs duties on goods transported by merchants should be based on customs valuation and that disputes should not arise due to differences with the Association's valuation. It has been found that the value of goods written on the permits issued by the Business Control Committee often differs from the customs valuation, leading to frequent disputes among merchants. According to customs regulations, for goods with permits from the Business Control Committee, customs officials do not inquire about the value written on the permit, regardless of whether it is higher or lower than the customs valuation. As long as the name, trademark, and quantity of the goods are consistent with what is written on the permit, the goods are released. Therefore, even if the value of goods written on the permits issued by the Association differs from the customs valuation, merchants should pay taxes based on the customs valuation and should not dispute the matter due to differences with the value written by the Association. After receiving the order, the Joint Associations have notified their members to comply accordingly.</p>

<h3>Navy</h3>
<p>—Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>Military Class (10)</p>
<p>This disturbance finally reached the ears of the senior elders in the capital. It is said that the elders have already begun negotiations with the Tokyo authorities.</p>
<p>Zhenren finally couldn't bear it anymore and wrote a letter to the principal. The full text is still preserved. In short, it is a passionate letter, with only one difference from other petitions: it also expresses sympathy for the students of Yizhong who have lost their principal. While our own aspirations must be thoroughly realized, the students of Yizhong who have lost their "father" also deserve sympathy. We hope that a good principal will come soon—that's the gist of it.</p>
<p>Expressing sympathy to a school that is constantly fighting with satchels on one side and black medical bags on the other is proof that Zhenren is a "good boy." He was like this since elementary school, and even after he became an adult, he was still a big "good boy." However, although he is an admirable young man, he does not have the so-called great heroic demeanor. At least, until he decided to take action, no one paid attention to him—</p>
<p>The urgent issue of the principal's transfer was soon resolved. Thanks to the appropriate measures taken by the prefectural governor, he was able to remain in Nichu. Cheers resounded throughout the school. From that day on, the people of the military class began their hard work again under the lights of the high and clear autumn night.</p>
<p>(11)</p>
<p>The final hurdle is finally approaching. It was very cold in Kagoshima when they were giving lectures on the biographies of righteous people at Jian'ershe. From that night until the naval academy's academic examination, there were less than ten days left.</p>
<p>Peiren studied late into the night in that small, attic-like room on the second floor. Although the dim light was bright on the desk, the portrait of Saigo Nanshu that Zhen'ichiro-niisan hung on the wall was so dim that even his eyebrows could not be distinguished. Only the two words "必勝" (certain victory) written on white paper could still be vaguely seen.</p>
<p>After ten o'clock, his sister, Matsuko, brought a brazier with burning flames and coarse tea. "Thank you, I don't need the brazier." He only left a cup of hot tea. In this place, boys originally didn't use braziers, but that custom has gradually been abolished recently.</p>
<p>Half of the candidates had already been eliminated during the physical examination, and most of the people would fail the academic examination. No matter how talented, no one had confidence in this examination. Zhenren could only waver between the Greater Saigo's doctrine of "doing one's best and waiting for destiny" and Major Kikuchi's doctrine of "decide and act, and even ghosts and gods will avoid you." In the end, he still had to sit at his desk and work hard.</p>
<p>December 20th finally arrived. The examination hall was in the auditorium of Zhenren's alma mater.</p>
<p>Day 1: Algebra, English. Day 2: Geometry, Physics, Chemistry. Day 3: Japanese History, Japanese, Classical Chinese, Composition. Day 4: Oral examination.</p>
<p>On the night before the first day, he deliberately didn't study and went to bed early. The next morning, he felt very calm. When he arrived at school, he saw a mountain of candidates, each looking like a talented genius. He gradually felt uneasy. Soon, according to the examiner's instructions, he entered the examination hall. He found his semi-body photo and the covered examination paper on the desk with his number. When everyone was seated, the hall became silent.</p>
<p>"Start!" Such a loud command was issued. This voice echoed in Peiren's heart, his pulse beat erratically, and while listening to the sound of his own heartbeat, he turned over the exam paper.</p>
<p>English in the morning and algebra in the afternoon—both were his favorite subjects, but now he was no longer confident. He could only concentrate on writing the answers.</p>
<p>"If the examination results are particularly poor, further participation in the examination will be suspended." This was written in the applicant's guide. The results of each day were announced on the same day.</p>
<p>That evening, Zhenren and his friends from the military class went to see the notice board. Only Zhenren and Kumazawa's numbers were not crossed out with red lines.</p>
<p>The second day also passed safely. The third day also passed easily. The fourth day was the oral examination, which was easy. That night, Zhenren fell into a dream as if he were drunk.</p>

<h3>Reorganizing the Baojia Self-Defense System</h3>
<p>— Donglai</p>
<p>The so-called Baojia Self-Defense Corps was originally a good method for the public to govern and defend themselves. If it is managed properly, both the government and the people will benefit. If it is not managed properly, problems will arise. This is certainly not the original intention of the government in establishing the Baojia Self-Defense Corps.</p>
<p>Shanghai has been running the Baojia Self-Defense Corps for two years now. Although it cannot be said to have made great achievements, it does help to make up for the inadequacy of the police force, which can be seen everywhere. However, there are also many complaints about the guard duty of the Self-Defense Corps. This cannot but be blamed on the lack of knowledge of some Baojia chiefs and their abuse of power. Therefore, the current Baojia chiefs must be strictly screened to remove corrupt elements and given rigorous training. Then the complaints can be silenced, and the development of the Self-Defense Corps will naturally become even greater. This point should be paid attention to by the governing authorities.</p>
<p>Now that the prices of everything are soaring, who does not feel the pain except for the speculative nouveau riche? The people, in order to struggle for a living, have to work hard to maintain their livelihoods. However, because of the guard duty issue, they are forced to temporarily suspend their work, which has a considerable impact on their income. This is by no means a good government system. In ancient times, spring hunting, summer plowing, autumn gathering, and winter hunting were all used to teach the people during agricultural work. This kind of intention was very good, that is, to prevent the people from hindering their production. Now, forcing the people to serve in the Self-Defense Corps during their work hours has already violated the ancient precepts of the former kings. Because the people have no choice but to suffer, they discuss it with the Baojia chiefs, and the corrupt Baojia chiefs do not follow the government's intentions, but offer various pretexts to provide the people with considerable convenience. For example, some people who work outside during the day are forced to stand guard during the day, and some people who work at night are forced to stand guard at night, as if their orders are absolute and there is no room for negotiation. Their purpose in doing so is to take the opportunity to extort money and force people to hire someone to take their place. According to the government's regulations, all civil servants, doctors, teachers, and students can be exempted from service in the Self-Defense Corps, but some people follow the orders, and many people disregard the orders. All this is hoped that the responsible authorities will make earnest rectification, then the people will be very fortunate!</p>

<h3>Fuxing Hospital Specially Establishes Economic Wards</h3>
<p>Fuxing Hospital, located at 536 Chang Le Road (formerly Rue Bourgeat), spares no effort in its work to help the poor and sick. In addition to continuing to provide charitable outpatient services and dispensing medicine, it has recently, in view of the rising prices, found that ordinary poor patients often suffer from disease because they are limited by their finances and have no ability to seek medical treatment, thus delaying treatment. Therefore, in accordance with the principle of "from the society, for the society," the surplus of the hospital's business income is allocated to help poor patients with hospitalization and medical expenses, and special civilian wards are established. Only fifty yuan is charged per day, including meals and medical expenses. All poor patients who wish to receive economic hospitalization and treatment can go to the hospital for treatment. If they are indeed poor, they can also apply to the hospital for completely free treatment. In addition, the hospital's charitable outpatient internal medicine (no smoking cessation department) is open every Tuesday and Thursday from 10:00 am to 11:30 am; surgery, trauma, orthopedics, ENT, and dermatology (no venereal disease department) are open every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 2:00 pm to 4:00 pm; obstetrics examination is open every Saturday from 10:00 am to 12:00 pm. The registration fee and medicine fee are completely waived.</p>

It is also stipulated that teachers of all grades must conduct home visits after completing their lessons so that students' families can understand the school's educational policies at any time.
