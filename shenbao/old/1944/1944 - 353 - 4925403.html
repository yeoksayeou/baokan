<h3>雷伊泰島陸上戰況</h3>
<p>自從十月二十日敵美軍在雷伊泰島强行登陸以來，雙方當即在該島展開劇烈血戰。下面所記，就是新近從雷伊泰島最前綫回來的某參謀所講該處日軍奮戰的狀况，以及雷伊泰島戰事的特色。某參謀自最初起即在該方面指揮作戰。</p>
<p>戰事特徵</p>
<p>從雷伊泰島歸來，第一件想到的事，便是想使國民知道我軍如何在雷伊泰奮戰的情形。本人所說，雖然是片斷的，但亦下難窺知一斑。</p>
<p>雷伊泰島作戰的特色，第一就是敵方的運輸綫甚長，且在其尖端作戰，而其尖端所恃的飛行塲至今尙不完全，但敵軍正圖運用物量補救這個弱點。與此相對，我方則是自己勢力範圍內的作戰，後方相近之處擁有不少飛行塲。</p>
<p>第二，敵軍圖在琉球羣島，台灣洋面及菲律賓羣島東方海面憑藉機動部隊的優勢，壓倒我方航空陣，而在雷伊泰島登陸，但因我方數次航空作戰，其企圖遭受挫折，不得不實行非常冒險的上陸作戰。</p>
<p>第三，與新幾內亞。塞班等地孤立無援的作戰不同，日軍的偉大戰力可以出動於戰鬥的正面。</p>
<p>敢死肉搏</p>
<p>關於戰鬥的情況，最具體最扼要的事例，便是肉搏衝鋒隊的戰法。衝鋒隊的捨身戰法，起自將校以至下士官兵，都能實踐這點，決不是輕易做得到的。培里琉島日軍衝鋒隊的偉勳，當然是再尊貴也沒有了。但雷伊泰島並不像那些島嶼一樣孤立無援，援軍正源源而來，友機也非常活躍，海軍的出擊也是料想得的的，所以雷伊泰島上到衝鋒隊一定有些不同。本來，在這樣的情形下，當然用不着想到敢死衝殺，可是，事實上正有許多壯士志願參加，爭先恐後地請纓殺敵。</p>
<p>下面所講的便是我自已親身經騐的一件事。那是十一月八日訪問〇〇先遺隊的基地時的事情。從朝上起，就有大暴風。這時，〇〇隊有一個報吿來，略謂「今日爲紀念大詔奉戴日，茲以〇〇時期，派出最初的衝鋒隊。現已部署一切，舉行簡單的餞別宴，各人皆甚激昻，請部隊長亦來致訓訣別。一部隊長剛於二日前從前綫歸來，得訊後，便冒着大雨，翻山越嶺地趕去鼓勵部下。途中相當危險，費時甚久，再加大雨大風，困難可想而知。但部隊長仍能準時趕到，向敢死隊員說道：好好兒幹，我和軍旗一直在山上望你們奮戰！」並將帶去的御酒分賜各人。看到大家用飯盒蓋喝御酒時的光景，使人感慨莫名。</p>
<p>這批敢死隊員的戰果，其後想必發表。或許有人以爲這樣的敢死衝鋒隊相繼出現，乃是理所應有的，可是，如此平淡地做着應做的事，在敵軍方面卻是絕對不可能的。</p>
<p>說到這裏，且將敵軍作戰的方式提出來講一講，以見一斑。憑恃物量的敵　　他們是如何作戰的呢？在開始的時期，敵軍的步兵是完全看不到的，祇是不恤工本地大防其迫擊砲機關槍，等到他們認爲足够時，步兵方隨在戰車後面偸偸摸摸爬遠來。這期間，我們不放一槍，等在戰壕襄，一待敵兵衝近，便老實不客氣地猛擊。於是，敵方歩兵旋轉身就逃。有趣的是：步兵一逃，戰車也必跟着逃。而且，他們的衝鋒必在認爲此方兵力單薄或火力減弱時，所以對於這些傢伙，肉搏攻擊隊的衝殺是不能和他同日論的。</p>
<p>陸海恊同</p>
<p>其次，關於陸海的協同作戰，從來陸海合作的事情，屢屢被人提到，一到前綫去，便可知道陸海兩軍是渾然一體，完全沒有差別的。其次，因爲海軍的某飛行塲無論如何必須馬上使用，所以跑去視察。踏勘之後，心想要完全使用的話，至少要十天才修得好，不過仍要他們在三天內趕修完工。海軍的工程隊立刻畫夜兼工，果然如期修好。又，近處的橋樑被炸毀壞以後〇〇參謀長下令速修，連夜動工，等到淸晨三時，居然完工。眞沒想到會如此快。海軍方面獻身似地協力，固是當然的事情，可也値得感謝。</p>
<p>敵感窮困</p>
<p>要之，雷伊泰島上戰事正在進行中。敵軍是有錢人的戰法，但我們第一綫的士兵是勇敢的。衝入敵陣以後，勇士們常常帶回美國香烟等物送給部隊長。</p>
<p>十一月十五日，瑪拿軋斯那斯方面，敵軍由空中擲下給養品，不料全港在我方陣地裏，士兵們大喜，稱它爲羅斯福的禮物。敵軍前綫的補給如何困難，由此可知。再則，塔克羅班及其他敵軍飛行塲，因怕我軍攻擊，正在設法將飛機藏起來。今日，雷伊泰灣內有許多敵船，其中有的觸了礁，有的橫倒一面。在今日以前，他們所侵攻的地方都是孤立無援的島嶼。美軍將飛機隱藏起來而作戰的事情，在今日以前有嗎？他們　在何處被逼實行空山補　呢？望着己方運輸船殘骸而戰鬥的事情，他們在今日以前有過一次嗎？這就是敵軍今日已經騐到過去所無的決戰。敵軍也感到棘手了。我方固然苦，但敵軍也是嚐到預想不到的苦戰況味了。奮鬥不屈者最後必勝。必勝的信念即由此而生。（譯自十二月一日每日新聞）</p>
<h3>日內閣局部改組將斷行強力政治　小林氏具有副總理性格</h3>
<p>東京二十二日中央社電　日政府此次改組內閣之一部，確立遂行決戰政治之强力姿態，尤以小林氏就任翼政會總裁後，其政治意義極爲重大，其在內閣的地位之實質，帶有副總理性格，豫期將出席戰爭最高指導會議，担任國內政治運行之主軸，同時，翼政會之活動態勢及政治體系，或將出現更大之變化，日本戰爭政治之運行態勢，亦將因戰局之推移，而步入最後階段，小林國務相當入閣之時，所表示誠意如次：（一）確立更强軔之重官民一體之國內態勢。（二）強化團結民間政治力之翼政會，積極善用之。（三）反映民意之翼政會戰時施策，由政府採用實行。（四）爲適應戰局之決戰階段，必須强化政治，因之更應增加速度，勇斷實行。以上四項決意，爲內閣推進力，乃當前之急務，同時翼政會全體作爲總裁之後盾，担任活潑之政治活動，因之，小磯首相將以此政治的後盾，强化軍官民一體之態勢，斷行强力政治，確立必勝之國民組織，强化翼政會本身等。其他政策方面，將謀軍需食糧之增產，增强運輸力，動員勞務，迅速斷行，確保最低國民生活等戰時施策，此次議會必將以此種問題爲中心，展開活潑之意見，集中推進的議論，故頗堪期待。</p>
<h3>褚外長昨晚　歡宴日外相</h3>
<p>東京二十二日中央社電　國府外交部長褚民誼，二十二日下午六時，假中國大使館宴請重光外相，作種種懇談。</p>
<h3>日戰時資源　研究會成立</h3>
<p>東京二十二日中央社電　日本爲調査及硏究大東亞之天然資源，特設立戰時資源研究會，二十一日下午三時，假此間大東亞會館舉行成立典禮，參加者有日本技術院總裁藤山，商工經濟會會長，陸海軍及其他各官廳代表與學界各專門人員約百餘名，首由該研究會會長田中長三郞說明創立旨趣，繼由來賓等致祝詞，至五時半始散會。</p>
<h3>大陸縱貫綫打通運輸力將益增強</h3>
<p>東京二十二日中央社電　日軍縱斷中國大陸之作戰，因十月南寗方面日軍與越南方面日部隊之連繫完成，故已完全打通矣。即連結釜山，奉天，北平，鄭州，漢口，衡陽，桂林，南寗，河內之縱貫中國大陸之大鐵路，業因此次作戰而行將實現，幷將湘桂鐵路之柳州與中法邊境鎭南關間，約四百五十五公里之鐵路綫互相連接，同時，復將此次作戰戰塲之粵漢湘桂加以修整，平漢路旣可恢復舊觀，縱貫中國大陸連接法屬越南之大鐵路，即因此次作戰，趨於成功。如再將法屬越南與泰國問之鐵路連絡，自建設上最有望之河內南方，經過塔開庫至泰國鐵路之北方綫昆巴比之長約四百公里之路綫加以建設，即可直通昭南島，雖將法翼越南與泰國之連結放置不論，連結中國與法屬越南之鐵路建設及一部作戰地區仍有殘餘，至廣州之粵漢鐵路恢復工作，不得不加緊建設，因如此可完成西貢，河內，廣州等地物資之運輸。又欲完成此大陸縱貫鐵路，須首先實施運輸材料以及鐵路建設之動員，其次動員於此次作戰中鹵獲之車輛及大批之資材，同時，由滿鐵方面出以援助等問題，均應詳爲考慮。此外，和平地區不必要車輛之調用，似亦有必要，又以漢口，武昌間揚子江上之連絡甚爲重要，蓋由此當更可完成釜山，河內每月數萬噸之運輸力。又如將通達廣州之粵漢路打通，則大陸方面運輸力將益爲强化，而縱貫中國大陸，連結廣州，北平約二千公里之長途，即將源源運送戰時物資也。</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>治安與節約</h3>
<p>語云：「家有常業，雖飢不餓；國有常法，雖危不亡。」</p>
<p>日前本市警察當局爲適用戰時特別刑法，發表談話，提示它的重要性，一方面警局將實施冬防，市府冬賑會已商定具體施賑計劃，這些措置，足以測知當局對於上海治安的維持具有決心。當茲戰爭步入決戰階段，需要有安定的後方來支特前方，所以，維持上海的治安，非常重要，至於如何確立上海治安，我們希望政府急速健全政治，使「國有常怯」來貫澈政令，使人民「雖飢不餓」之外，再提出一點意見，申述確立治安的重要，和節約與治安的關係。</p>
<p>上海是全國政治文化的領導核心，所以上海社會秩序的安定與否，足以影響到全國的城市和鄕村。自從國府還都以來，和平地區的治安，至今還成問題，內地人民，都以上海爲安樂土，　集上海。這樣，使上海的治安，也不能理想的確立。</p>
<p>現在的上海怎樣呢？是全國最奢侈最糜費的都市了，一切想得出的舒適和享受，祗要有錢，不愁沒有辦法。奢糜之風，遠超過戰前，一點不像戰時後方重要基地，戰時經濟的領導中樞，相反的，一切的一切是在領導整個中國社會走上海淫誨盜之路。爲了滿足個人的慾望，無錢的想弄到有錢，有錢的則想弄到更多的錢，因而囤積投機，爲非作惡，不擇手段的弄錢，不顧戰爭的勝利，不念民族的利益，不管社會基礎要動搖。在上海的人如此想，如此做，在內地的人亦如此想，如此做，這種風氣流行至今，已成爲政治上的癌。弄到錢的人，則到上海來揮霍，眞如化子拾到的黃金，不知艱難，越益造成上海奢糜之風，增加社會的恐慌與不安，治安問題，因之日見嚴重。</p>
<p>上海是遠東的大商業都市，戰爭之後，國際貿易大部份停頓，某些商業，因戰時經濟統制，而變更經營的性質和方式了。但是，它的商業化並不因此受影響，而且某種商業受到更自由的發展餘地，囤積投機是一種方式，它的爲害民生，擾亂經濟，是比較明顯的，還有一種是不易感覺到的屬於享樂性的商業經營。譬如一家比一家高貴的咖啡館，一家比一家富麗的食府，以電影名星做廣吿，以廣招徠。固然，他們是將本求利，無可厚非。但是，爲了投合上海人的優越享受，勢必竭盡智能，爲顧客設想。那末，促成上海奢糜之風，雖非主因，實也有火上加油之嫌。再爲了追求更多的利潤，不受物價高漲的損失，那末，又勢必囤積大批原料。這些原料，大都是與民生有關的必需品，居民存糧只能足三月之用，這些商店，可以營業爲名，大量購存，在物價起漲時，爭相購囤，益加刺激物價。其結果，以有用有限之物資，用之於奢侈的消耗，則與爲害民生，擾亂經濟，沒有很大的差別。</p>
<p>所謂「朱門酒肉臭，路有餓死骨。」今天的節約，不在一般人民方面，他們已節到無可再節的程度。要節約的是中產階級以上的人民，尤其是那些奸商，他們非法的弄到了錢，還允許地們盡情的亨受，我們還是不能眞正確立治安，安定民生。必須嚴格執行戰時刑事特別法，同時也須股格管理物資消耗用途，有計劃的發給各種商業登記證，澈底遵行節約生活，也只有眞正的節約來配合政治的健全，法律的制裁，才能使社會趨於安定。</p>

<h3>國府特任陳公博　兼中央軍校長　陸軍將校團昨舉行畢業禮</h3>
<p>南京二十二日中央社電　國府令民國三十三年十二月六日特任陳公博兼中央陸軍軍官學校校長，此令，特任陳公博兼中央陸軍將校訓練團團長，此令。</p>
<p>南京二十二日中央社電　中央陸軍將校訓練團將校隊第六期幹部總隊第九期，業已訓練期滿，全體學員於本日上午十時舉行畢業典禮，同時教導隊亦舉行入伍式，軍委會委員長兼該團團長陳代主席及教育長簫叔宣氏，均親蒞參加主持一切。計到該團兼團附軍委會總參謀長鮑文樾·陸軍部部長葉蓬·及來資李警察總監·陳憲兵司令·鄭參贊武官長·凌代海軍部長·劉師長·鍾師長·秦師長·曁盟邦矢崎最高顧問·淺海少將等數十人。行禮如儀後，由陳兼團長領導，向汪故團長靜默致悼，旋即由全禮學員向陳兼團長行最敬禮，向團附教育長曁全體官佐敬禮，向最高顧問暨來賓敬禮各一鞠躬，復由陳兼團長致訓，（詞另錄）學員代表趙玉華致答詞，詞畢由陳兼團長親自頒發畢業證書及獎品贈品等，最後陳兼團長宣讀陸海空軍軍人調條，全體合唱團歌，於高呼口號聲中宣告禮成。</p>
<p>陳兼團長親致訓辭</p>
<p>陳兼團長訓詞如下：這次將校隊召集各團長受訓，意義非常重大，最近注故團畏逝世以後，本人事務冗繁，無機會與各位見面，很是抱歉。今天要告訴各位的是：我們今後的工作，一定要完成汪故團畏未竟的遺志，目前最大的任務是，如何完成參戰。我們參戰是自動的，上自國府下至人民，一致希望完成的。本人今天要簡單說明中國爲何要參戰，我們知道中國成爲半殖民地的國家，是鴉片戰爭後造成的，何謂半殖民地，其意義則等於殖民地而未至殖民地之地步，但比普通殖民地更慘。普通殖民地爲一帝國主義所宰割，半殖民地爲幾個帝國主義所分割，所以中國百年以來不能解放，完全由於英帝國主義造成今日悲慘的地位。辛亥革命的表面，雖爲一個內政問題，實際是受帝國主義壓迫，政府無能而促成的，辛亥革命雖未明白表示實由於反帝國主義運動所造成，由反帝國主義而影響到內政，凡研究革命史者要明白此曆。辛亥革命成功，隨即失敗，因大家對革命之觀念糢糊，民國十三年國民黨的改組，至此始明白表示反帝國主義運動，檢討中國革命失敗之因子，即爲帝國主義之作祟，在第二次全國代表大會中，即明白表示對內打倒軍閥，對外打倒帝國主義，自從國民黨改組後，人民才明自反帝國主義的意義，而一般靑年心中在斯時反帝國主義之聲浪爲最高，而帝國主義憑藉其百年來之力量，仍舊根深蒂固，因此中國內亂始終不止，這是歷史上告訴我們之事實。（未完）</p>

<h3>祝六漫遊</h3>
<p>— 逸飛</p>
<p>祝橋六灶亦爲南匯之大鎭，自有觀光之必要。記者自大田出發，抵護塘港碼頭，舟子蝟集，爭攬生意，以天氣惡劣，故索價竟達千金，令人咋舌，奈以行程已定，且有友人相候於祝橋，兼以捨舟外並無他法可圖，致今番不得不一破慳囊，重渡片舟生涯矣。</p>
<p>濃霧迷漫景物模糊</p>
<p>是晨迷霧頗重，百步之外，景物糢糊，此景此情，不覺令人想及三國時，孔明草船借篆之故事，與　昔負笈英倫時，所遇之漫天大霧，其色如雲，而氣息則如燻烟，如此小霧，與之相較，實不啻小巫之見大巫耳，猶憶及最嚴重之一次，爲一九三六年之元旦日，是晚出門時，着實一驚，（因室內有燈故不覺）伸手不見五指，街頭車輛，皆開黃色燈，（燈上罩黃色玻璃）緩步如蝸牛，當時爲安全起見，捨車步行，沿途摸索前進，否則定與路人碰個滿懷。</p>
<p>風塵僕僕話祝橋</p>
<p>記者午前十時半到達此間，隨友前往預定之住所，略事休息後，旋往街頭巡禮一番。按祝橋又名竹橋，相傳昔鎭中築有竹建之橋，故名。市橋錯綜複雜，有棋盤街之名，街道狹小，市客雖勝南匯，但與周浦大團兩鎭相較，似輸一籌。其調濟金融之機關，除獨一無二之典當一家外，尚無銀號錢莊之設立，故流通本鎭市面上之支票，種類至多，共計有上海川沙周浦南匯各地者，蔚爲大觀。居民對此實覺頭痛。據云，已有人正在籌劃開設一錢莊，以應需要，未知確否。</p>
<p>全區分十七鄉鎭，一七九保，一九二〇甲，一九九四四戶，人口總計八四五五六人，（本年十月調查統計）內男子三九八四四人，女子四四七一二人，居民以務農爲最多，經營小本商業者，次之。全鎭人口約萬餘人。</p>
<p>農產物以黃豆，小麥，棉花，爲輸出上之大宗，全區共有農田約二十二萬畝，內除有白塗萬餘畝，已圍蘆課三萬七千畝，未圍一萬三千畝外，實際上可種之田畝，亦僅約一五七六七三畝，計豆田一三〇七八畝，花生田一〇三九六畝，稻麥田五三六五五畝，棉花田二一八五八畝，蕃薯四三五九五畝，雜糧八三八四畝，其他六七〇七畝（本年六月調查統計）。</p>
<p>祝橋鎭附近農民，泰半爲小自耕農，其數約佔農民總數百分之九十，故一般晨民於勤勞耕作之下，頗多餘利，生活亦較他處安定。但有不少靑年，爲環境所誘惑，耽於逸樂者，頗不乏人，智識份子中，則又有熱心公益者甚多。</p>
<p>本鎭治安上，尚屬穩定，駐軍除盟軍外，並有保安隊一中隊，區長喬望雲兼任警察所長，對政令推行，尚屬順利。</p>
<p>事變後之兩大損失</p>
<p>（一）祝橋事變前，爲上川鐵路之終點，本擬定擴展至南匯。不意事變驟起，工作停頓，而江鎭至祝橋一段鐵軌計長十二里，曾被不法者拆毀，橋樑亦被破壞，現雖沿途橋樑全部修復，然鐵軌早被盜賣一空，當此戰事物資缺乏之秋，事實上無法重建，今路基雖在，汽車自江鎮可通至南匯，然無車稱，致不能應用，惜哉！惜哉！</p>
<p>（二）鎭西有完全小學一所，以地名之，校舍係神廟改建，狹溢異常，然其佈置楚楚可觀。今春本地商紳捐資，建屋五間，較爲寬敞，計有學生五百餘人，分九教室上課。校長黃晋，深得學生家屬之信仰。據聞該校經濟絕對公開，教員均供膳宿，即本鎭教員亦須完全住校，所以同事間宛如一家人，和衷共濟，生活雖淸苦，而工作精神，並未因是稍懈，實屬難能可貴。該校在廿六年時，由本鎭市紳捐建新厦一所，在現校址之址側，佔地十餘畝，計樓房十二幢，平房八間，中間設備極爲完善，惜事變發生時，地方負責乏人，校舍被燬夷爲平地，令人爲之悼惜不止。</p>
<p>夕陽斜映吊骨塔</p>
<p>午後記者雇嚮導捨舟陸行，隨同步往六灶，進發途中，遇一小塔，高祇丈餘，四周下景色，疏影橫斜，楓葉凝丹，倍添秋色，不竟憶及前人有「楓葉紅於二月花」之句，當時導遊者，曾吿記者一齣可泣可歌的故事。</p>
<p>據謂當洪楊之亂，浦東地方，也曾受到極大的蹂躪，事平之後，繼之大疫，致當時白骨辨野，慘不忍諸。時有一高僧，日夜辛勤，從斷垣殘　中，揀出完整磚瓦，建立此塔，同時收集荒野中，無人收殮之白骨，貯入塔中，以慰寃魂。故時人稱之爲「積骨塔」。如是儈者，實亦有心人也。記者同時憶及巴黎市中有一地區名「地獄」者，上爲車站，下有地窖，旣深且廣，欲入內參觀者，須先購門券，並備有洋燭，人各一枝，魚貫而入，祇覺陰氣沉沉，令人不寒而慄，尸骨滿坑滿谷，堆積如山，名之爲「地獄」，實甚確當。但利用尸骨，招攬生意，供諸私囊，則令人不齒也。</p>
<p>沿途道路頗寬，具有公路模型，絕不類記者事前想像中之鄕間羊腸小道。然其橋樑，却甚仄狹，當質之於嚮導，據謂去年春，周浦至祝橋之公路，一度興築，旬日之間，路基初步完工，惜因橋樑材料缺乏，因之延擱至今，任其坍毀，近又有重建之說，未卜能賞現否。</p>
<p>荒涼滿目話鹿溪</p>
<p>六灶又名鹿溪，鎭爲一字形，東西長約三里，東隣祝橋，西接周浦，三十年前此間商業極盛，邇來市面日衰，推其原因，不外治安不能確立，民生毫無保障，鄉民相率離去，而另一原因，則爲交通工具，至爲落伍，以是市面目難興旺耳戰後的六灶，除掉一泓淸水，尚無發生變化外，其餘一切，面目全非。又比間有一點頗令人引以爲奇者，即無軍隊駐防，而僅有等於徒手之警察十數名，因槍械旣老且蒼，有若無耳，然盜刧案件，則又少見。</p>
<p>此間因市面蕭條，商店類皆半掩其門，似有難言之隱，頗似滬市新年中，商店接財神日之狀態，故謔者云，六灶商店，無異「天天候財神，不見財神臨」，再觀肆中商品，十櫥九空，雖鬧市之中，亦時有空屋發現，而西段冷落街市，門竟「此戶而封」，斷坦殘壁之處，更無人遠問，實滿目瘡夷，凄慘之情形，不類一區之首鎭，較諸周浦大團不啻有天壞之別。</p>
<p>差強人意的教育</p>
<p>該鎭有六灶小學一所，却仍不改戰前模樣，校舍會毀於兵　，民國二十九廿曾價修理，雖僅三埭平房，但頗爲壯麗，計有學生四百餘人，分八教室上課，並有初中一級，教員均由本鎭靑年担任，男女各半，男教員均住舍校中，不用校工，親司炊事灑掃，並植蔬工作，以供己用，其苦幹精神，實足令人欽佩。</p>
<p>據調查所得，該區中有鄉村小學念餘所，均係私立，實以縣政府經費支絀，無力顧及，故祗得由當地區公所，就地等欵，加以救濟，並另聘專員，負責指導，其法至善。但於教育行上演來，頗不合法，深望當局注意之，加以改善。</p>
<p>十畝三間天下難揀</p>
<p>按六灶係南匯之第三區，位處南匯縣之中心，照例一切宜較他區良好。但迄今市容冷落，交通落伍，不僅汽車未通，而人力車亦未之見。除有一二定期腳划船，逐日往來於周浦外，居民旅行均賴徒步。又該區港汶紛岐，故農民均採小舟爲運輸工具。</p>
<p>全區共分十一鄉鎭，一〇四保，一〇五二甲，一〇但三七戶，人口總計三九四五五人（本年十月份調查統計），內中男子一七一七八人，女子二二二七七人。居民泰半務農，然因農田過少（全區不足十一萬畝），農田分配上形成僧多粥少之現象。據田五十畝者，堪稱首富。平均一般農民，僅有田約五六畝耳，故此間有「十畝三間天下難揀」之俗諺。蓋意指有十畝沃田，及三間瓦房者，不易多見也。以是六灶農村中，其經濟情況之枯竭，不難由此窺得一二。</p>
<p>農產物以棉，麥，稻，大豆，花生，爲大宗，計花田有四二二九一畝，麥稻田有四九六九二畝，大豆五，二八七〇畝，花生田有二一一五畝，雜糧二六四三畝，其他計有三七〇〇畝，今歲雨水不調，晚稻歉收，故農民所收穫之米糧，僅足供年內所需。至棉花收成雖較佳，但因成本高昂，而售價只抵米價之一半，兼以目前租價以米爲標準，故如是自耕農僅能糊口，佃農生活堪慮，幸該區人士，頗能刻苦，民風之　樸，全縣，全縣八區中以爲最。（南匯寄）</p>

<h3>松島部長　談菲島戰局　並譴責敵機盲目轟炸</h3>
<p>日駐華艦隊報道部昨日下午二時循例舉行報道當會，由松島部長報告電伊泰島及明多羅島作戰情形。茲誌于左：</p>
<p>敵方宣傳完全虛偽</p>
<p>雷伊泰島方面戰鬥，日美兩軍在繼續激戰中，敵方由麥克沃塞司令部發出消息稱：雷伊泰島作戰，對彼有利，甚至謂己經結束云云，此種宣傳，實虛偽之至。明多羅島敵方有一部軍隊登陸，經日精銳部隊攻擊，已使敵方後續部隊不能繼績，已陷于苦戰狀態。日陸海兩軍之航空部隊如神風隊及其他部隊與均在勇猛作戰，現在敵人似在沉在袋子底下去，日方誘敵作戰，可謂已告成功。</p>
<p>敵機盲炸怨聲載道</p>
<p>關於華中敵人空襲情形，最近敵方在華中空襲，極爲平凡，其對武漢地區較爲激烈，民衆損失，亦較重大。自十一月廿四日以來，過去一般認爲安全地帶之舊法租界，敵方亦開始轟炸，故中國人在該處之避難處所，亦不復存在。一般民衆對渝政權及美政府，怨聲載道，反感日深，茲舉數例，可以證明：（一）據一因這空襲，財產全部損失者言，大東亞建設，除中日兩國互相提携邁進外，無他路可走，而障碍此種建設者，即爲在華搗亂之美國軍隊，故非予以澈底擊滅不可。（二）另據一被害之中國婦女談，商業繁榮及財產均無用處，鬼機（指美機）把小孩都殺了，還能說和平的漢口嗎？我們除返鄉外別無辦法，究竟鬼機爲什麼和小孩過不去，非殺掉不可呢？（三）又有被害者稱，渝政權果非中國人嗎？如何與英美合作行動呢？關於被害同胞的遭受就不知道嗎？此次轟炸，囤積商人，頗受損害，對中國一般民衆影響甚大。最近敵方又採取威嚇手段，對南京，上海，漢口，杭州等重要都市民衆，勸告其避難，此係威嚇行爲，亦係敵方謀略，無關緊要。關於敵方盲炸，中日　兩航空部隊，當然極力設法擊滅之，而在民衆方面對防空事項，亦應加以注意，使被書程度減至最小限度。</p>
<p>艱苦忍耐克服苦難</p>
<p>現在戰爭已至決戰狀態，交戰國國民的忍耐如何，實可影響勝敗，關係極爲重要，如此次德國在西部戰綫發動反攻，出乎英美人意料之外，此舉實爲德國一般國民堅忍不拔的力量，充分的發揮出來。現在中日兩國人民一定要忍耐，克復艱難困苦，準備下一次的反攻，這是一個重大的時期。</p>
<p>轟炸氣球在美發現</p>
<p>據美國報紙發表，日本製造的氣球，載的炸彈在美國內地發現，此自爲極堪愉快之事，但本人對此，尚不能說明。美國關於航空及兵器的發達，宣傳甚烈，但科學發明，各國均有，幷非敵美專利，如德國在西綫所有戰車，均有招越世界的效力。</p>
<h3>艦隊報道部　今日放映會</h3>

<h3>保甲自警團本部　分發新臂章</h3>

<p>短評</p>
<h3>節約！節約！</h3>
<p>一年一度的聖誕節又到了，一般習於嬉戲的人更視爲窮奢極慾的機會到了，正準備怎樣消磨這狂歡之夜。一般娛樂塲所更迎合狂歡者的心理，正準備怎樣擴大娛樂節目。記得去年聖誕節前夕，本報調查各大舞塲等娛樂塲所，舞與菜的消耗，統計在五千萬元以上。今年物價十數倍於去年，消耗的數目也將較去年更爲驚人。</p>
<p>但是，我們須得睜眼環顧現賞環境，天寒地凍，冬賑殷切。前綫將士，浴血奮戰。貧苦大衆，生活艱難。一切社會公益事業均感經費拮据，維特爲難。在這樣的環境中，節衣縮食，協助社會事業，增强總力參戰，尚且不遑，焉有心情度此醉生夢死的奢糜生活呢？</p>
<p>我們希望準備消磨狂歡之夜的人們，節約金錢，節約精力，貢獻於國家社會，獨繁何如衆樂。如能節約糜費捐助本報助學金特別勸募，嘉惠清寒學子，其意義尤深。</p>

<p>讀者助學消息</p>
<h3>靑年學生界　紛起勸募「助學金」</h3>
<p>前幾天，本報曾爲文喚起各學校師生發動「集體」的力量，贊助「特別勸募」，向校內或校外有力的人，努力推動，並希望初中以上每校能組成一隊。果然各學校已起而響應，有的義演話劇，有的代爲勸募，有的儲蓄助學，雖方式不一，而熱情則同。昨天正行女中特派某教師先送二萬元一隊，據說絡續有好幾隊將組織成立；復旦大學受助學生徵得上海釘廠及丁社第一二兩隊，約翰大學亦將組成五六隊，日內亦可繳來。其餘同德醫學院，震旦女子文理學院，準備演劇，以所得辦理本校淸寒學生助學金。凡上所云，足見各校靑年學生朝氣蓬勃，見義勇爲的精神，使人佩服！不過我以爲敎師生活最爲清苦，學生正在孜孜爲學得時期；目前只是分利，而不能生利，我們尤其希望能生利的工商界人士，念茲在茲。也鼓起同情的心理，多多爲淸寒學子效勞，多多爲助學金勸募；於己於人，爲國爲民，何樂不爲？</p>
<p>正行女中集體助學</p>
<p>正行女子中學函云：「敬啓者，在本月初貴報公佈「特別勸募隊」辦法後，敝校受助學生，即自動發起合力勸募，第一批業已募集二萬元正，先行如數塞上，定名爲「正行女中第一隊」，並再繼績積極推動，聊盡綿力。查本市學校林立，歷屆受助於貴報助金者，數以萬計，如能全體發動合力勸募，羣策羣力，則聚沙成塔，預定目標，不難如期達到，區區微意，尚祈鑒察」。</p>
<p>又環球信託銀行王海波君兩云：「貴報爲救濟失學靑年，組織助學金特別勸募隊，於困苦艱難之境，作百年樹人偉舉，熱心毅力，曷勝欽佩。茲組成環球銀行隊，將所募得助學金二萬元，隨函附奉，即希　收掣給收絛爲荷。」</p>
<p>大觀園移賀儀助學</p>
<p>靜安寺路三五四號大觀圍董事長袁屨登氏兩云；「逕啓者，敝公司現定十二月二十四日上午十時舉行開幕典禮，因時間倉卒，並爲節省物力起見，除登報公告外，各親友槪不發東，所收賀儀，悉數充作貴報及新聞報貸助學金，藉資貧寒學子膏火，爲諸親友造福，敬希賜予刋布，以示提倡爲荷。</p>
<p>啓明日記義賣助學</p>
<p>本報讀者助學金特別勸募隊，各界響應日多，昨日又得四馬路啓明書局熟誠參加，即以該局新出版之啓明日記二十部提供義賣，每部一千元，售得之欵，全部捐充助學金。按啓明書局爲本市新書業巨擘之一，所出啓明日記，每年刋行，印製最精，銷售最廣，此次慨捐多部，義賣助學，益見出版家愛護讀書靑年之熟忱，令人感奮。</p>
<p>昨收助金　中國國貨公司一萬元，伍麟趾一萬元，吳微蘭二千五百元，曹振甫·振遠·（賀鍾一桂君令郎訂婚禮）合二千元，王惠房一千元，周君，蔡景　（祝祖母健康）各五百元，銘記三白五十元，鮑眉　三百元，應永玉（送　仰　君尊翁逝世十周紀念禮）一百元，共收儲券二萬七千二百五十元，結存六百九十八萬五千一百二十三元。</p>

<h3>Japanese Air Force Attacks Enemy Ships Near San Jose Day and Night, Shooting Down Five Enemy Planes in Air Combat</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Philippines Base, 22nd – A Japanese air squadron mixed with special attack units attacked enemy ships near San Jose, Mindoro Island, during the day on the 20th, sinking one medium-sized transport ship.

It sank into the water after a second explosion.</p>
<h3>Situation of Land Battles on Leyte Island</h3>
<p>Since the enemy American forces forcibly landed on Leyte Island on October 20th, both sides have engaged in fierce and bloody battles on the island. What follows is an account of the Japanese army's courageous fighting there and the characteristics of the Leyte Island battle, as told by a staff officer who recently returned from the front lines of Leyte Island. The staff officer has been directing operations in that area since the beginning.</p>
<p>Characteristics of the Battle</p>
<p>The first thing that comes to mind upon returning from Leyte Island is the desire to inform the nation about how our troops fought bravely on Leyte. What I say may be fragmented, but it will give a glimpse into the situation.</p>
<p>The first characteristic of the Leyte Island operation is that the enemy's supply line is very long and they are fighting at its tip, and the airfield on which that tip relies is still not complete. However, the enemy is trying to remedy this weakness by using a large amount of supplies. In contrast, we are operating within our sphere of influence, with many airfields close to the rear.</p>
<p>Second, the enemy attempted to overwhelm our air power by relying on the superiority of their mobile units in the Ryukyu Islands, the Taiwan sea area, and the sea east of the Philippine Islands, and then land on Leyte Island. However, due to our repeated air operations, their attempt was thwarted, and they had to carry out a very risky landing operation.</p>
<p>Third, unlike the isolated and helpless operations in New Guinea, Saipan, and other places, the great fighting power of the Japanese army can be deployed on the front lines of the battle.</p>
<p>Suicide Charge</p>
<p>Regarding the battle situation, the most concrete and concise example is the tactic of the suicide charge. The selfless tactic of the charge team, from officers to non-commissioned officers and soldiers, can be practiced, which is not easily done. The heroic deeds of the Japanese army's charge team on Peleliu Island are certainly most honorable. However, Leyte Island is not as isolated and helpless as those islands; reinforcements are coming steadily, friendly aircraft are also very active, and naval attacks are also expected. Therefore, there must be some differences in the charge team on Leyte Island. Originally, under such circumstances, there is naturally no need to think about suicide attacks. However, in fact, many brave men volunteered to participate and eagerly requested to fight the enemy.</p>
<p>What I am going to talk about below is something I experienced myself. It was when I visited the base of the advance party of the 〇〇 team on November 8th. From morning on, there was a big storm. At this time, a report came from the 〇〇 team, roughly stating that "Today, to commemorate the Great Imperial Rescript Observance Day, the first suicide charge team is being dispatched during the 〇〇 period. All preparations have been made, and a simple farewell banquet is being held. Everyone is very excited, and we request that the unit commander also come to deliver a farewell speech." A unit commander had just returned from the front line two days ago. Upon receiving the news, he braved the heavy rain and crossed mountains to encourage his subordinates. The journey was quite dangerous and took a long time. The difficulties caused by the heavy rain and wind can be imagined. However, the unit commander still arrived on time and said to the suicide squad members: "Do a good job, I and the military flag will always be watching you fight on the mountain!" He also distributed the imperial sake he had brought with him to everyone. The sight of everyone drinking imperial sake with rice bowl lids filled me with indescribable emotions.</p>
<p>The results of this suicide squad will surely be announced later. Perhaps some people think that the successive appearance of such suicide charge teams is only natural. However, doing what should be done so plainly is absolutely impossible for the enemy.</p>
<p>Speaking of this, let's talk about the enemy's way of fighting to see a glimpse. How do the enemies who rely on material resources fight? In the beginning, the enemy infantry could not be seen at all; they only used a large number of mortars and machine guns without caring about the cost. When they thought it was enough, the infantry followed behind the tanks and secretly crept up. During this time, we did not fire a single shot, waiting in the trenches. As soon as the enemy soldiers approached, we frankly and unceremoniously launched a fierce attack. As a result, the enemy infantry turned around and fled. Interestingly, when the infantry fled, the tanks would also flee. Moreover, their charge must be when they think our forces are weak or firepower is reduced. Therefore, the attacks of the suicide attack team cannot be compared to them.</p>
<p>Land-Sea Cooperation</p>
<p>Next, regarding land-sea cooperation, the matter of land-sea cooperation has always been mentioned repeatedly. Once you go to the front line, you can know that the land and sea armies are completely integrated and there is no difference at all. Secondly, because a certain airfield of the navy had to be used immediately, I went to inspect it. After surveying it, I thought that it would take at least ten days to repair it completely for it to be fully usable, but I still asked them to rush to complete the repairs within three days. The navy's engineering team immediately worked day and night and completed the repairs as scheduled. Also, after a nearby bridge was bombed and destroyed, Chief of Staff 〇〇 ordered it to be repaired quickly. Work began overnight, and it was actually completed by 3:00 AM. I really didn't expect it to be so fast. It is, of course, a matter of course that the navy cooperated sacrificially, but it is also worth thanking them for.</p>
<p>Enemy Feels Impoverished</p>
<p>In short, the battle on Leyte Island is ongoing. The enemy's fighting style is that of rich people, but our first-line soldiers are brave. After rushing into the enemy's阵营, the brave soldiers often bring back American cigarettes and other items to give to the unit commander.</p>
<p>On November 15th, in the Managasta area, the enemy dropped supplies from the air, but unexpectedly, the entire area was within our positions. The soldiers were overjoyed and called it Roosevelt's gift. This shows how difficult the enemy's frontline supply is. Furthermore, the enemy's airfields in Tacloban and other places are trying to hide their aircraft for fear of our attacks. Before today, the places they invaded were all isolated and helpless islands. Has the American military ever hidden its aircraft to fight before today? Where have they been forced to carry out supply補　in empty mountains? Have they ever fought while looking at the wreckage of their own transport ships before today? This is the decisive battle that the enemy has already experienced for the first time. The enemy also feels棘手. We are certainly suffering, but the enemy is also tasting an unexpected bitter battle. Those who struggle unyieldingly will eventually win. The belief in victory arises from this. (Translated from the December 1st Mainichi Shimbun)</p>
<h3>Partial Cabinet Reshuffle Will Enforce Strong Politics; Mr. Kobayashi Has the Character of a Deputy Prime Minister</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd – The Japanese government's partial reshuffle of the cabinet this time establishes a strong stance to carry out decisive war politics. In particular, Mr. Kobayashi's assumption of the presidency of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association (翼政會) is of great political significance. His position in the cabinet has the essence of a deputy prime minister, and he is expected to attend the Supreme War Guidance Council and serve as the main axis of domestic political operations. At the same time, the activities and political system of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association may undergo greater changes, and the operational state of Japanese war politics will also enter the final stage due to the shift in the war situation. Mr. Kobayashi's expression of sincerity when he entered the cabinet as a state minister was as follows: (1) To establish a stronger domestic situation of unity between government officials and civilians. (2) To strengthen the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, which unites civilian political forces, and actively utilize it. (3) To have the government adopt and implement wartime measures of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association that reflect public opinion. (4) To strengthen politics in order to adapt to the decisive stage of the war, and therefore to increase speed and courageously implement measures. The above four resolutions are the driving force of the cabinet and are urgent at present. At the same time, the entire Imperial Rule Assistance Association serves as the president's support and carries out active political activities. Therefore, Prime Minister Koiso will use this political backing to strengthen the unity of military officers and civilians, enforce strong politics, establish a national organization for certain victory, and strengthen the Imperial Rule Assistance Association itself, etc. In other policy areas, efforts will be made to increase the production of military supplies and food, enhance transportation capacity, mobilize labor, and promptly implement measures to ensure the minimum national livelihood and other wartime measures. This parliamentary session will undoubtedly focus on these issues, launching lively opinions and focused discussions, which is quite expected.</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Chu Hosted a Banquet for Japanese Foreign Minister Last Night</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd – Foreign Minister Chu Minyi of the National Government hosted a banquet for Foreign Minister Shigemitsu at the Chinese Embassy at 6:00 PM on the 22nd for various earnest discussions.</p>
<h3>Japanese Wartime Resources Research Association Established</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd – Japan established the Wartime Resources Research Association to investigate and research natural resources in Greater East Asia. The inauguration ceremony was held at the Greater East Asia Hall here at 3:00 PM on the 21st. Participants included Mr. Fujiyama, President of the Japanese Technology Institute, the President of the Association of Commerce and Industry and Economics, representatives from the Army, Navy, and other government agencies, and approximately one hundred experts from the academic community. First, the President of the Research Association, Tanaka Chozaburo, explained the purpose of the founding. Then, guests delivered congratulatory speeches. The meeting adjourned at 5:30 PM.</p>
<h3>The Opening of the Continental Trunk Line Will Increase Transportation Capacity</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd – The Japanese army's operation to bisect mainland China has been fully opened due to the completion of the connection between the Japanese army in the Nanning area and the units in the Vietnam area in October. That is, the great railway that connects Busan, Fengtian, Beiping, Zhengzhou, Hankou, Hengyang, Guilin, Nanning, and Hanoi, which runs through mainland China, is about to be realized due to this operation, and the railway line of about 455 kilometers between Liuzhou on the Hunan-Guangxi Railway and Zhennanguan on the Sino-French border will be connected to each other. At the same time, the Guangdong-Hankou and Hunan-Guangxi lines, which were the battlefields of this operation, will be repaired. The Pinghan Railway can be restored to its former appearance. The great railway that runs through mainland China and connects French Indochina will be successful due to this operation. If the railway between French Indochina and Thailand is connected, the approximately 400-kilometer route from the south of Hanoi, which is most promising for construction, through Takhek to the northern line of the Thai railway, Khun Phapphap, will be constructed, allowing direct access to Shonan Island. Even if the connection between French Indochina and Thailand is left aside, there are still remnants of railway construction and a partial operation area connecting China and French Indochina. The restoration work of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway to Guangzhou must be accelerated, so that the transportation of materials from Saigon, Hanoi, Guangzhou, and other places can be completed. In order to complete this continental trunk railway, it is necessary to first implement the mobilization of transportation materials and railway construction, and secondly to mobilize the vehicles and large quantities of materials captured in this operation. At the same time, problems such as assistance from the South Manchuria Railway Company should be carefully considered. In addition, it seems necessary to transfer unnecessary vehicles in peaceful areas. Also, the connection on the Yangtze River between Hankou and Wuchang is very important, because this will further complete the transportation capacity of tens of thousands of tons per month from Busan to Hanoi. If the Guangdong-Hankou Railway to Guangzhou is opened, the transportation capacity on the mainland will be further strengthened, and the long distance of approximately 2,000 kilometers that runs through mainland China and connects Guangzhou and Beiping will continuously transport wartime materials.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Public Security and Thrift</h3>
<p>As the saying goes: "A family with regular work will not starve even in famine; a country with consistent laws will not perish even in danger."</p>
<p>Recently, the city's police authorities issued a statement regarding the application of the Special Criminal Law during wartime, highlighting its importance. On the one hand, the police局局 will implement winter defense, and the city government's winter disaster relief committee has agreed on a specific disaster relief plan. These measures are enough to indicate that the authorities are determined to maintain public security in Shanghai. As the war enters its decisive stage, a stable rear is needed to support the front. Therefore, maintaining public security in Shanghai is very important. As for how to establish public security in Shanghai, we hope that the government will quickly improve politics so that "a country with consistent laws" can implement government orders, and that the people can "not starve even in famine." In addition, we will put forward a point of view and elaborate on the importance of establishing public security and the relationship between thrift and public security.</p>
<p>Shanghai is the leading center of national politics and culture. Therefore, the stability of Shanghai's social order is enough to affect cities and villages across the country. Since the National Government returned to the capital, public security in peaceful areas has still been a problem, and people in the interior consider Shanghai to be a land of peace and happiness, flocking to Shanghai. In this way, the establishment of public security in Shanghai cannot be ideally established.</p>
<p>What is Shanghai like now? It is the most luxurious and wasteful city in the country. Everything comfortable and enjoyable that can be imagined, as long as you have money, you don't have to worry about finding a way. The extravagance and wastefulness far exceed that before the war. It is not at all like an important wartime rear base or the leading center of the wartime economy. On the contrary, everything is leading the entire Chinese society onto the path of licentiousness, obscenity, and theft. In order to satisfy personal desires, those without money want to get money, and those with money want to get more money. As a result, they hoard and speculate, do evil, and use any means to make money, regardless of the victory of the war, the interests of the nation, or the foundations of society being shaken. People in Shanghai think this way and do this way, and people in the interior also think this way and do this way. This trend has been popular until today and has become a political cancer. Those who make money come to Shanghai to squander it, like a beggar who picks up gold, unaware of the difficulties, which further creates a wasteful atmosphere in Shanghai, increases social panic and unrest, and makes the public security problem increasingly serious.</p>
<p>Shanghai is a large commercial city in the Far East. After the war, most of the international trade was suspended, and certain businesses changed the nature and manner of their operations due to wartime economic controls. However, its commercialization was not affected by this. Moreover, certain businesses were given more room for free development. Hoarding and speculation are one way, and their harm to people's livelihoods and disruption of the economy are relatively obvious. There is also a kind of pleasure-oriented business operation that is not easily perceived. For example, coffee shops are more luxurious than each other, and restaurants are more magnificent than each other, using movie stars for advertising to attract customers. Of course, they are trying to make a profit, which is understandable. However, in order to cater to Shanghai people's superior enjoyment, they will inevitably exhaust their intelligence to think for their customers. Then, while it is not the main cause, it also adds fuel to the fire in promoting Shanghai's wasteful atmosphere. Furthermore, in order to pursue more profits and not be affected by rising prices, they will inevitably hoard large quantities of raw materials. Most of these raw materials are necessities related to people's livelihoods. Residents' food storage can only last for three months, but these shops can purchase and store large quantities in the name of business, and rush to purchase and hoard when prices rise, which further stimulates prices. As a result, using useful and limited materials for extravagant consumption is not very different from harming people's livelihoods and disrupting the economy.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "Behind the vermillion gates, meat and wine go to waste, while on the roads lie the bones of those who have frozen to death." Today's thrift is not on the part of the general public, who have already economized to the point where they can no longer economize. Those who need to economize are the middle class and above, especially those unscrupulous merchants. If they have illegally made money and are still allowed to enjoy themselves to their heart's content, we will still not be able to truly establish public security and stabilize people's livelihoods. We must strictly enforce the Special Criminal Law during wartime, and also strictly manage the use of material consumption, issue various business registration certificates in a planned manner, and thoroughly adhere to a thrifty life. Only genuine thrift combined with sound politics and legal sanctions can make society tend toward stability.</p>

<h3>The National Government Specially Appoints Chen Gongbo Concurrently as Principal of the Central Military Academy; Army Officer Corps Holds Graduation Ceremony Yesterday</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency) – The National Government issued an order on December 6th of the 33rd year of the Republic (1944), specially appointing Chen Gongbo concurrently as Principal of the Central Army Military Academy. In addition to this order, Chen Gongbo was also specially appointed as Commander of the Central Army Officer Training Corps.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency) – The 6th term of the officer corps and the 9th term of the cadre contingent of the Central Army Officer Training Corps have completed their training. All students held a graduation ceremony at 10:00 AM today. At the same time, the training squadron also held an enlistment ceremony. Chairman Chen, also Acting Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission and Commander of the Corps, and Director of Education Xiao Shuxuan, personally attended to preside over the entire event. Those in attendance included Military Affairs Commission Chief of General Staff Bao Wenwei, who was also an additional staff member of the Corps; Minister of the Army Ye Peng; Police Commissioner Lai Zi Li; Commander of the Gendarmerie Chen; Military Attaché Zheng; Acting Minister of the Navy Ling; Division Commander Liu; Division Commander Zhong; Division Commander Qin; as well as Supreme Advisor of the Allied Nations, Major General Yazaki, and several dozen others. After the ceremony was conducted according to protocol, Commander Chen led a moment of silence in mourning for the late Commander Wang. Immediately afterward, all graduating students paid their highest respects to Commander Chen, saluted the adjunct staff members, the Director of Education, and all officers, and bowed to the Supreme Advisor and honored guests. Subsequently, Commander Chen delivered an address (the speech will be recorded separately). Student representative Zhao Yuhua delivered a response. After the speech, Commander Chen personally presented graduation certificates, awards, and gifts. Finally, Commander Chen announced the regulations for the transfer of military personnel in the Army, Navy, and Air Force. The entire group sang the Corps song in unison, and the ceremony concluded with the shouting of slogans.</p>
<p>Commander Chen Delivers a Personal Address</p>
<p>Commander Chen's address is as follows: This time, summoning the various regimental commanders for training is of great significance. Recently, after the passing of the esteemed Commander Wang, I have been occupied with numerous affairs and have not had the opportunity to meet with everyone. I apologize for this. What I want to tell everyone today is: in our future work, we must fulfill the unfinished aspirations of the late Commander Wang. Our greatest task at present is how to complete our participation in the war. Our participation is voluntary, and it is the unanimous hope of everyone from the National Government down to the people. Today, I want to briefly explain why China must participate in the war. We know that China became a semi-colonial nation after the Opium War. What is a semi-colony? Its meaning is equivalent to a colony but not quite reaching the level of a colony, but it is even more tragic than an ordinary colony. Ordinary colonies are dominated by one imperialist power, while semi-colonies are divided by several imperialist powers. Therefore, China has been unable to liberate itself for a century, entirely due to the creation of this tragic position by British imperialism. The surface of the Xinhai Revolution, although it was a domestic political issue, was actually caused by the oppression of imperialism and the incompetence of the government. Although the Xinhai Revolution did not explicitly state that it was due to an anti-imperialist movement, it was influenced by anti-imperialism in domestic politics. Those who study the history of the revolution must understand this historical fact. The Xinhai Revolution succeeded but then failed because everyone's concept of revolution was vague. The reorganization of the Kuomintang in the 13th year of the Republic (1924) clearly stated that it was an anti-imperialist movement. Examining the factors of China's revolutionary failure, it was the machinations of imperialism. In the Second National Congress, it was clearly stated that internally we would overthrow the warlords and externally we would overthrow imperialism. Since the reorganization of the Kuomintang, the people have understood the meaning of anti-imperialism, and the anti-imperialist wave in the hearts of young people at that time was at its highest. However, imperialism, relying on its strength of a hundred years, is still deeply rooted. Therefore, China's internal strife has never stopped. This is a historical fact that tells us this.

<p>Travel Communications</p>
<h3>Wandering in Zhu Liu</h3>
<p>— Yifei</p>
<p>Zhuqiao and Liuzhao are also major towns in Nanhui, making a visit worthwhile. The reporter departed from Datian and arrived at the Hutanggang pier. Boatmen swarmed, vying for business. Due to the bad weather, they demanded an exorbitant price, leaving one speechless. However, since the itinerary was set and friends were waiting in Zhuqiao, and with no other way to travel besides by boat, I had no choice but to break my frugal ways and embark on another boat journey.</p>
<p>Dense Fog Obscures the Scenery</p>
<p>The fog was quite heavy this morning, obscuring the scenery beyond a hundred paces. This scene and feeling involuntarily reminded me of the story of Kongming borrowing arrows with straw boats during the Three Kingdoms period, and also of the heavy fog I encountered when I was studying in England. Its color was like clouds, and its breath was like smoke. This small fog was like a small witch compared to a great witch. I still remember the most serious incident, which was on New Year's Day in 1936. I was shocked when I went out that night (because I didn't notice it indoors with the lights on). I couldn't see my fingers. Vehicles on the street all turned on yellow lights (with yellow glass covers) and moved slowly like snails. For safety's sake, I abandoned the car and walked, groping my way along the road, otherwise I would have bumped into passersby.</p>
<p>Dust-Covered Talk of Zhuqiao</p>
<p>The reporter arrived here at 10:30 AM. I went to the pre-arranged residence with a friend. After resting briefly, I went to the street for a stroll. Zhuqiao is also known as Zhuqiao, and it is said that there was a bridge built of bamboo in the town in the past, hence the name. The city bridges are intricate and complex, giving it the name "chessboard street". The streets are narrow. Although there are more merchants than in Nanhui, it seems inferior compared to the two towns of Zhoupu and Dantuan. In terms of financial institutions, in addition to the unique pawnshop, there are no silver shops or money houses. Therefore, the types of checks circulating in the town's market are numerous, including those from Shanghai, Chuansha, Zhoupu, and Nanhui, which is quite a sight. Residents find this very troublesome. It is said that some people are planning to open a money house to meet the needs. I don't know if this is true.</p>
<p>The entire area is divided into seventeen townships, one hundred and seventy-nine baos, one thousand nine hundred and twenty jias, one thousand nine hundred and ninety-four households, with a total population of eighty-four thousand five hundred and fifty-six people (statistics from the October survey). Among them, thirty-nine thousand eight hundred and forty-four are men and forty-four thousand seven hundred and twelve are women. Most residents are farmers, followed by those who run small businesses. The town has a population of about ten thousand people.</p>
<p>Agricultural products, with soybeans, wheat, and cotton as the main exports. The entire area has about 220,000 mu of farmland, of which over 10,000 mu have white mud, 37,000 mu have been enclosed as reed fields, and 13,000 mu have not been enclosed. In reality, only about 157,673 mu of land can be cultivated, including 13,078 mu of soybean fields, 10,396 mu of peanut fields, 53,655 mu of rice and wheat fields, 21,858 mu of cotton fields, 43,595 mu of sweet potato fields, 8,384 mu of miscellaneous grain fields, and 6,707 mu of other fields (statistics from the June survey).</p>
<p>Most of the farmers near Zhuqiao town are small owner-cultivators, accounting for about 90% of the total number of farmers. Therefore, most farmers have considerable surplus after diligent cultivation, and their lives are more stable than in other places. However, many young people are tempted by the environment and indulge in pleasure. There are quite a few. Among the intellectuals, there are many who are enthusiastic about public welfare.</p>
<p>The security in the town is relatively stable. In addition to the Allied forces, there is also a security team of one company. District Chief Qiao Wangyun concurrently serves as the police chief, and the implementation of government orders is relatively smooth.</p>
<p>Two Major Losses After the Incident</p>
<p>(1) Before the incident, Zhuqiao was the terminus of the Shangchuan Railway. It was originally planned to extend to Nanhui. Unexpectedly, the incident suddenly occurred, and work was stopped. The railway tracks from Jiangzhen to Zhuqiao, totaling twelve li in length, were dismantled by lawless elements, and the bridges were also destroyed. Although all the bridges along the way have been repaired, the railway tracks have long been stolen and sold. In this autumn of war material shortages, it is impossible to rebuild in reality. Although the roadbed is still there, cars can travel from Jiangzhen to Nanhui, but there are no cars available, so it cannot be used. What a pity! What a pity!</p>
<p>(2) There is a complete elementary school west of the town. Named after the place, the school building was converted from a temple, which is extremely narrow and overflowing, but its layout is quite impressive. This spring, local merchants and gentry donated funds to build five rooms, which are relatively spacious. There are more than 500 students, divided into nine classrooms. The principal, Huang Jin, is deeply trusted by the students' families. It is said that the school's finances are absolutely transparent, and all teachers are provided with board and lodging. Even the teachers in the town must live in the school, so colleagues are like a family, working together in harmony. Although life is simple, the spirit of work has not slackened because of this, which is truly commendable. In the 26th year of the Republic (1937), the city gentry of the town donated funds to build a new building for the school, on the side of the current school site, covering an area of more than ten mu, including twelve buildings with floors and eight flat houses. The intermediate equipment was very complete. Unfortunately, when the incident occurred, there was a lack of responsible people in the area, and the school building was destroyed and razed to the ground, causing people to mourn endlessly.</p>
<p>The Setting Sun Shines on the Bone Tower</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the reporter hired a guide and abandoned the boat for land travel. Following him to Liuzhao, on the way, we encountered a small tower, only a little over ten feet high. The scenery around it, with sparse shadows and slanting branches, and maple leaves coagulating into red, added to the autumnal colors. I couldn't help but recall the saying of the ancients, "Maple leaves are redder than flowers in the second month." At that time, the guide told the reporter a touching and heroic story.</p>
<p>It is said that during the Taiping Rebellion, Pudong was also subjected to great devastation. After the war, a great plague followed, resulting in white bones scattered across the fields, a tragic sight. At that time, there was a high-ranking monk who worked diligently day and night, picking out complete bricks and tiles from the broken walls to build this tower, while collecting the white bones in the wilderness that no one had collected and stored them in the tower to comfort the wronged souls. Therefore, people at the time called it the "Accumulated Bone Tower." Such a monk is truly a person with a heart. The reporter also remembered that there is an area in Paris called "Hell", with a station above and a cellar below, both deep and wide. Those who want to enter for a visit must first purchase a ticket and prepare candles, one for each person, and enter in single file. One only feels the yin atmosphere sinking, making people shiver. Corpses are piled up like mountains in pits and valleys. Calling it "Hell" is indeed very apt. However, using corpses to attract business and profit for oneself is disgusting.</p>
<p>The roads along the way are quite wide, with the model of a highway, completely unlike the narrow country roads that the reporter had imagined in advance. However, the bridges are very narrow. When I questioned the guide, he said that last spring, the highway from Zhoupu to Zhuqiao was once built. Within ten days, the roadbed was initially completed, but due to the lack of bridge materials, it was delayed until now, allowing it to collapse. Recently, there has been talk of rebuilding, but I don't know if it can be realized.</p>
<p>A Desolate Scene Talk of Luxe</p>
<p>Liuzhao is also known as Luxe. The town is in a one-character shape, about three li long from east to west. It borders Zhuqiao to the east and Zhoupu to the west. Thirty years ago, commerce was extremely prosperous here. In recent years, the market has declined day by day. The reason for this is nothing more than the inability to establish security, the lack of guarantee for people's livelihoods, and the villagers leaving together. Another reason is that the means of transportation are extremely backward, so the market is difficult to prosper. The Liuzhao after the war, in addition to a clear water, has not changed. Everything else is unrecognizable. One point that is quite surprising is that there are no troops stationed here, only a dozen police officers, with weapons so old and useless that they are as good as nothing. However, robbery cases are rare.</p>
<p>Because the market is sluggish, most of the shops here are half-closed, as if they have unspeakable secrets, much like the state of shops in Shanghai during the New Year when they are waiting for the god of wealth. Therefore, jokers say that the shops in Liuzhao are "waiting for the god of wealth every day, but the god of wealth does not come." Looking at the goods in the shops, nine out of ten cabinets are empty. Even in the bustling market, empty houses are occasionally found, and the western section of the deserted street is even "sealed off". In places with broken walls and ruins, no one cares about them. The desolate and miserable situation is unlike the main town of an area, and is completely different from Zhoupu and Dantuan.</p>
<p>Education That Is Barely Satisfactory</p>
<p>There is one elementary school in the town, Liuzhao Elementary School, which still retains its pre-war appearance. The school building was destroyed in the war. It was repaired in the 29th and 30th years of the Republic (1940-1941). Although there are only three flat buildings, they are quite magnificent. There are more than 400 students, divided into eight classrooms, and there is also a junior high school level. The teachers are all young people from the town, half male and half female. Male teachers live in the school dormitory, without using school workers, personally taking charge of cooking, sweeping, and planting vegetables for their own use. Their hardworking spirit is truly admirable.</p>
<p>According to the investigation, there are more than a dozen rural elementary schools in the area, all of which are private. This is because the county government's funding is insufficient and it cannot take care of them. Therefore, it can only be subsidized by the local district office, and a specialist is hired to be responsible for guidance. The method is excellent. However, it is quite illegal in terms of educational administration, and it is hoped that the authorities will pay attention to it and improve it.</p>
<p>Ten Mu of Land and Three Rooms Are Hard to Find in the World</p>
<p>Liuzhao is the third district of Nanhui, located in the center of Nanhui County. In principle, everything should be better than in other districts. However, to this day, the city is deserted, and the transportation is backward. Not only are there no cars, but there are also no rickshaws. In addition to one or two regular foot-operated boats that travel between Zhoupu every day, residents rely on walking for travel. Moreover, the area is full of ports and rivers, so farmers use small boats as transportation tools.</p>
<p>The entire area is divided into eleven townships, one hundred and four baos, one thousand and fifty-two jias, and one thousand and three hundred and seven households, with a total population of thirty-nine thousand four hundred and fifty-five people (statistics from the October survey), of which seventeen thousand one hundred and seventy-eight are men and twenty-two thousand two hundred and seventy-seven are women. Most of the residents are farmers, but because there is too little farmland (less than 110,000 mu in the entire area), there are too many monks and too little porridge in the distribution of farmland. Those with fifty mu of land can be called the richest. On average, ordinary farmers have only about five or six mu of land. Therefore, there is a saying in this area, "Ten mu of land and three rooms are hard to find in the world." It means that it is not easy to find someone who has ten mu of fertile land and three tile-roofed rooms. Therefore, it is not difficult to get a glimpse of the economic situation of the villages in Liuzhao from this.</p>
<p>The main agricultural products are cotton, wheat, rice, soybeans, and peanuts. There are 42,291 mu of cotton fields, 49,692 mu of wheat and rice fields, 5,287 mu of soybean fields, 2,115 mu of peanut fields, 2,643 mu of miscellaneous grain fields, and 3,700 mu of others. This year, the rainfall was uneven, and the late rice harvest was poor, so the rice harvested by farmers is only enough for their needs within the year. Although the cotton harvest is better, the cost is high, and the selling price is only half the price of rice. Moreover, the current rental price is based on rice, so owner-cultivators can only barely make ends meet, and the lives of tenant farmers are worrying. Fortunately, the people in the area are quite hardworking, and the folk customs are simple, the best among the eight districts in the entire county. (Nanhui Correspondent)</p>

<h3>Minister Matsushima Discusses the Philippine Island Battle Situation and Condemns Enemy Aircraft for Indiscriminate Bombing</h3>
<p>The Japan Fleet Press Department in China held a regular press conference at 2:00 PM yesterday. Minister Matsushima reported on the operations on Leyte Island and Mindoro Island. The following is a record:</p>
<p>Enemy Propaganda is Completely False</p>
<p>Regarding the battle on Leyte Island, Japanese and American forces are continuing to engage in fierce fighting. The enemy issued a message from the headquarters of General MacArthur, claiming that the Leyte Island operation was favorable to them, and even that it had already ended. This kind of propaganda is extremely false. A unit of enemy troops landed on Mindoro Island. After being attacked by the elite Japanese forces, the enemy's follow-up troops could not continue, and they are now in a difficult situation. The aviation units of the Japanese Army and Navy, such as the Kamikaze teams and other units, are fighting bravely. Now the enemy seems to be sinking to the bottom of the bag. It can be said that the Japanese side's strategy of luring the enemy in has been successful.</p>
<p>Complaints About Enemy Aircraft's Indiscriminate Bombing are Widespread</p>
<p>Regarding the enemy's air raids in Central China, the enemy's air raids in Central China recently have been extremely frequent. They are more intense in the Wuhan area, and civilian losses are also more significant. Since November 24th, the old French Concession, which was generally considered a safe zone in the past, has also been bombed by the enemy. Therefore, the refuge places for Chinese people there no longer exist. The general public is complaining about the Yu (Chongqing) regime and the American government, and their resentment is deepening. Here are a few examples to prove this: (1) According to someone whose property was completely lost in the air raid, there is no other way for the construction of Greater East Asia than for China and Japan to cooperate and move forward together. The obstacle to this construction is the American army disturbing China, so it must be completely destroyed. (2) According to another Chinese woman who was victimized, commercial prosperity and property are useless. The ghost planes (referring to American planes) killed the children. Can you still call Hankou peaceful? We have no choice but to return to our hometown. Why do the ghost planes have a problem with the children and have to kill them? (3) Some victims claim, is the Yu regime not Chinese? How can they cooperate with the British and Americans? Are they not aware of the suffering of the victimized compatriots? This bombing has greatly affected hoarding merchants and has a great impact on the general public in China. Recently, the enemy has adopted intimidation tactics, advising the people of important cities such as Nanjing, Shanghai, Hankou, and Hangzhou to take refuge. This is an act of intimidation and a trick of the enemy, which is not important. Regarding the enemy's indiscriminate bombing, the Chinese and Japanese air forces are of course doing their best to destroy them, and the public should also pay attention to air defense matters, so that the degree of book damage can be reduced to the minimum.</p>
<p>Endure Hardship and Overcome Difficulties</p>
<p>Now the war has reached a decisive stage. How the people of the belligerent countries endure it can affect the victory or defeat and is extremely important. For example, the recent German counter-offensive on the Western Front was unexpected by the British and Americans. This move is a full display of the perseverance of the general German population. Now, the people of China and Japan must endure, overcome difficulties, and prepare for the next counter-offensive. This is a major period.</p>
<p>Bombing Balloons Discovered in the US</p>
<p>According to American newspapers, balloons made in Japan carrying bombs have been discovered in the interior of the United States. This is naturally extremely gratifying, but I cannot comment on this yet. The United States has been heavily promoting its aviation and weapons development, but scientific inventions are available in all countries, not just the monopoly of the United States. For example, the tanks used by Germany on the Western Front all have the effect of inviting the world.</p>
<h3>Fleet Press Department Movie Screening Today</h3>
<p>The Japanese army's commando team is active in the Pacific Ocean, repeatedly annihilating the remaining enemies, and its heroic battles have established great achievements. The Allied Fleet Press Department, in order to make the press relations aspects of the city deeply aware, specially scheduled to screen a news film at 4:00 PM today (23rd) at the China Mao Hotel on the Bund of Nanjing Road to invite viewers.</p>
<h3>Discussion of Winter Relief and Porridge Distribution Plans</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government's Relief Committee convened the first meeting of the directors of the porridge distribution centers at 3:00 PM yesterday (22nd) in the No. 22 Hall of the Municipal Government, discussing porridge distribution and various plans. The meeting was attended by Huang Jingwan, deputy director of the relief group; Sun Guangdi, director of the general affairs group; and Master Fan Cheng, Feng Shiguang, Shi Tidu, Bai Guifen, Chen Zhiqing, Yang Yiqing, Master Zhenhua, Chen Xiuan, and Zhang Huien, directors of the first to ninth porridge distribution centers. It was decided to establish a ninth porridge distribution center at the Zhongjiao Daoyi Society at 1275 Changshou Road (formerly Route Say Zoong), which can provide porridge for 500 people. As for the addresses of the shelters, in addition to 180 Xiamen Road, where An Ziying, district chief of the Salvation Army Shanghai District, personally took office as director, the remaining two planned original sites were insufficient due to the equipment of the porridge distribution centers, and suitable locations are being selected.

Starting today (23rd), the porridge distribution centers will post announcements. All those who are truly impoverished can register at the nearest porridge distribution center. Porridge will be distributed every morning upon presentation of the certificate. Please do not miss this opportunity.</p>

The General Joint Bao Chief and Joint Bao Chief, who also serve as Baojia Committee members, will not be issued separate committee armbands.

<p>Short Commentary</p>
<h3>Economy! Economy!</h3>
<p>The annual Christmas is approaching, and those accustomed to revelry see it as an opportunity for extravagance, preparing to spend this night of celebration. Entertainment venues are catering to the psychology of revelers, preparing to expand their entertainment programs. I remember last year, on the eve of Christmas, this newspaper investigated major dance halls and other entertainment venues, and the consumption of dances and dishes was estimated to be over 50 million yuan. This year, prices are more than ten times higher than last year, and the amount of consumption will be even more astonishing than last year.</p>
<p>However, we must open our eyes and look around at the current environment. The weather is cold, and winter relief is urgently needed. Soldiers on the front lines are fighting bloody battles. The poor are struggling to survive. All social welfare undertakings are feeling financially strained and struggling to maintain themselves. In such an environment, economizing on food and clothing to assist social undertakings and enhance overall strength to participate in the war is hardly enough. How can we have the heart to live such a drunken and dreamy extravagant life?</p>
<p>We hope that those preparing to spend the night in revelry will save money and energy and contribute to the country and society. How much better is collective happiness than individual extravagance. If they can save on wasteful spending and donate to this newspaper's special fundraising for student aid, benefiting poor students, the meaning would be even more profound.</p>

<p>Reader's Student Aid News</p>
<h3>Young Students Actively Raising Funds for "Student Aid"</h3>
<p>A few days ago, this newspaper published an article calling on teachers and students of various schools to mobilize the power of "collective" to support the "special fundraising," to actively promote it to influential people within and outside the school, and hoping that each school above the junior high level could form a team. Sure enough, various schools have responded, some performing drama for charity, some collecting donations, and some saving for student aid. Although the methods are different, the enthusiasm is the same. Yesterday, Zhengxing Girls' High School sent a teacher to send 20,000 yuan as a first team. It is said that several teams will be organized in succession; Fudan University students benefiting from the program raised funds and formed the Shanghai Nail Factory and Dingshe First and Second Teams. St. John's University will also form five or six teams, which can also be submitted in the next few days. The remaining Tongde Medical College and Aurora Women's College of Arts and Sciences are preparing to perform plays to use the proceeds to run student aid funds for poor students in their schools. All of the above shows the vigorous spirit of the young students of various schools, who are admirable for their courage in doing what is right! However, I believe that teachers have the hardest life, and students are in a period of diligent learning. At present, they are only sharing benefits, but cannot generate benefits. We especially hope that business and industrial people who can generate profits will keep this in mind. Also, arouse compassionate psychology, do more to serve poor students, and do more to raise funds for student aid; what could be better for oneself, for others, for the country, and for the people?</p>
<p>Zhengxing Girls' High School Collective Student Aid</p>
<p>Zhengxing Girls' High School wrote in a letter: "Dear Sir, after your newspaper announced the 'Special Fundraising Team' method earlier this month, the students in our school who are benefiting from the program automatically initiated a joint fundraising effort. The first batch of 20,000 yuan has been collected and will be sent in full first, named 'Zhengxing Girls' High School First Team,' and will continue to actively promote it to do our best. There are many schools in this city, and tens of thousands of students have benefited from your newspaper's student aid in the past. If all of them can launch a joint fundraising effort and pool their efforts, then accumulating bit by bit, the predetermined goal will be easily achieved. We hope you will take note of our humble intentions."</p>
<p>Also, Mr. Wang Haibo of Universal Trust Bank wrote: "Your newspaper is organizing a special fundraising team for student aid to help out-of-school youth in difficult circumstances, and is undertaking the great cause of cultivating talents for a hundred years. Your enthusiasm and perseverance are admirable. Now, the Universal Bank team has been formed and will send the 20,000 yuan raised for student aid along with this letter. We hope you will acknowledge receipt and issue a receipt."</p>
<p>Daguan Garden Transfers Congratulatory Gifts for Student Aid</p>
<p>Mr. Yuan Ludeng, Chairman of Daguan Garden at 354 Jing'an Temple Road, wrote: "Dear Sir, our company is scheduled to hold an opening ceremony at 10:00 AM on December 24. Due to the urgency of time and in order to save material resources, we will not be sending announcements to our relatives and friends, except for publishing a notice in the newspaper. All congratulatory gifts received will be used for your newspaper's and the Xinwenbao's student aid loans to provide school expenses for poor students and benefit all relatives and friends. Please publish this to promote the cause.</p>
<p>Qiming Diary Charity Sale for Student Aid</p>
<p>The special fundraising team for student aid for readers of this newspaper has received an increasing number of responses from all walks of life. Yesterday, the Qiming Bookstore on Sima Road also enthusiastically participated, providing 20 copies of the newly published Qiming Diary for charity sale, each priced at 1,000 yuan, and all the proceeds will be donated to student aid. The Qiming Bookstore is one of the leading new bookstores in this city, and its Qiming Diary is published annually, with the finest printing and the widest sales. This generous donation of many copies for charity sale and student aid shows the enthusiasm of publishers in caring for young readers, which is inspiring.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Student Aid Receipts: China National Goods Company 10,000 yuan, Wu Linzhi 10,000 yuan, Wu Weilan 2,500 yuan, Cao Zhenfu, Zhenyuan, (congratulatory gift for the engagement of Mr. He Zhongyi's son) 2,000 yuan, Wang Huifang 1,000 yuan, Mr. Zhou, Cai Jing (wishing grandmother good health) 500 yuan each, Mingji 350 yuan, Bao Mei 300 yuan, Ying Yongyu (sending memorial gift for the tenth anniversary of Mr. Yang's father's death) 100 yuan, totaling 27,250 yuan in stored coupons, leaving a balance of 6,985,123 yuan.</p>

<p>Ninety-Eighth Team: Lin Kanghou Team 40,000 yuan</p>
<p>The above totals 426,000 yuan, with a total balance of 3,658,025 yuan.</p>
<p>We sincerely thank Mr. Lin Kanghou for his generous donation to two teams. Mr. Lan, Mr. Kang, and Mr. Ludeng (Mr. Yuan Ludeng donated the other day) are respected senior members of Shanghai. This time, they are exceptionally concerned about the "special fundraising" of this newspaper, lead by example, and are the first to recognize the teams. The enthusiasm of the three elders for caring for poor students is evident. We hope that business and industrial circles will take the lead bravely, act as pioneers, and quickly donate funds, which can break our predetermined record, which is a supreme honor for the poor students. Also, "Dingshe" is a ticket booth, and all the ticket friends, entertaining do not forget to help students, which makes people very grateful. There are many ticket booths in Shanghai, and I think there are not a few people who like to do good deeds!</p>

<h3>Benevolence Widely Bestowed, Benefiting the Poor and Needy</h3>
<p>Mr. Chuan Zhongwen is usually enthusiastic about public welfare and spares no effort. This time, our office initiated winter relief, and Mr. Chuan did not hesitate to work hard, running around to solicit donations, and his support was especially great. We have now raised 147,200 yuan, all of which will be used for winter relief expenses. Among them, 30,000 yuan was donated by Bi Donghui for his fiftieth birthday, at the request of Mr. Fu, to save and move the funds to help. The original letter is as follows: "Dear Sir, on a certain day of this month, it is my fiftieth birthday. I am disheartened by the difficulties of the times and dare not make any extravagance. Fortunately, your newspaper is holding winter relief, so at the request of Mr. Chuan Zhongwen, I have saved the money to be spent and transferred it to the winter relief fund. Please have the money delivered to Mr. Fu for transfer. Please check and accept."</p>
<h3>Boundless Grace</h3>
<p>Mr. Huang Zi'an wrote in a letter: "Dear Sir, I am not talented, but I have vowed to raise some student aid funds and winter clothes this winter to fulfill my duty. Yesterday, I first solicited donations from fellow Henan merchants in Shanghai, and within half a day, I received 40,000 yuan, which is enough to show that doing good is the greatest pleasure, and people share the same heart. I already have five children in school, so I also managed to raise 4,000 yuan to express my feelings. Together, the total is 44,000 yuan. Now, I will send the money along with the list of donors to your organization for verification, with half of the funds for student aid and half for winter clothes donations. In addition, most of the donors are friends from Henan, so please name it the Yuyou Team. The amounts are as follows: Zhu Yaoting 6,000 yuan, Wang Zidong, Zhang Xiuwu 5,000 yuan each, Zhang Dianqing 4,000 yuan, Miao Yasong, Zhang Yaotang, Pang Jingya, Yu Nianci, Wu Lechang, Cai Xinpi, Wang Liangcheng, Wei Wenqing, Wang Zuosheng, Zhang Yunzhong 2,000 yuan each, Huang Zi'an 4,000 yuan."</p>
<h3>Donating Small-Capital Loan Funds Is an Urgent Matter</h3>

After approval, the loan will be provided interest-free, with monthly repayments of the principal once a month, repaid in full in ten installments.</p>
<p>Donating small-capital loan funds can give poor people the opportunity to make a living and embodies the ultimate meaning of relieving unemployment. Recently, companies have been laying off employees, and unemployment has increased sharply, so donating small-capital loan funds is an even more urgent matter.</p>
<h3>Free Hospital Beds</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Health Experimental Zone Maternity Hospital has, through the solicitation of Dr. Su Ji Zhi, a member of the zone, received donations from two great philanthropists, Ms. Mo Pei'an and Mr. Wang Zhenhuan, for one permanent free maternity bed each, creating immeasurable blessings for poor pregnant women.

<h3>Child Welfare Association's Educational Work: Welcome to All for Visitation</h3>
<p>The China Child Welfare Association currently continues to be responsible for educating over three hundred children, all of whom are orphans, without parents, or homeless. The association has two institutions for the education of children, one being the Shanghai Child Welfare Institute and the other the Shanghai Refugee Child Welfare Center. According to Mr. Ding Bingnan, an officer of the association, the Child Welfare Institute was established ten years ago and is now located at 1231 Daxing Road (formerly Route Lafayette). The institute accepts orphaned children between the ages of six and twelve. If there is a good opportunity, they are properly placed, either adopted as sons or daughters, apprenticed, or matched for marriage, etc. There are currently 120 children in the institute. The Refugee Child Welfare Center was established after the outbreak of the war and is now located at 639 Manufacturing Bureau Road in Nanshi, inside the Bethel Hospital. It accepts children between the ages of four and fourteen. The plight of these children is most pitiable. Their parents and guardians were lost or sacrificed during the war and cannot resume caring for their children. The center currently houses 200 children, providing them with food, clothing, and appropriate education. Mr. Ding continued, stating that during the association's fundraising campaign, from December 24th to the 31st of this month, both of the aforementioned educational institutions welcome people from all walks of life to visit freely and kindly request guidance.</p>
<p>Also, the annual Christmas is approaching again. Among the children in the care institutions, Children's Day and Christmas are the most interesting and joyful. The association will hold Christmas celebrations at both institutions separately, with children performing various entertainment programs, and has invited standing committee members Lin Kanghou, Zhao Jinqing, Sun Ruihuang, Ding Boxiong, Wu Weide, etc., to give speeches. The association's Refugee Child Welfare Center is scheduled to hold a celebration this month on the 24th (tomorrow) at 2:30 pm, and the Child Welfare Institute is scheduled to hold it this month on the 25th at 2:30 pm. At that time, it is hoped that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will invite their relatives and children to participate.</p>
