<p>社評</p>
<h3>糧食問題的側面對策</h3>
<p>據一般估計，上海市有五百萬人口，尤以第一區更爲稠密。上海是都市，不是農村，粒穀不產。換言之，上海五百萬人都是米糧的消耗者，而不是米糧的生產者。所以，米糧成爲問題時，上海尤其感覺嚴重。目前上海面臨的米糧問題，就是具體的說明。</p>
<p>最近一周間，米價再度上漲後，已呈自然靜止狀態。各有關當局正在積極設法採辦與疏通來源，並取締囤積操縱，但在未得實際有效的調節辦法以前，與其空言希望米價下回，不如切切實實的做幾件足以促使	下跌的事，做一件是一件，做一分是一分。</p>
<p>我們在本月十日社評中，提出一個建議，希望市敢當局籌集款項，或向國家銀行借貸現金，採辦米穀及雜糧，專配給於勞動者及徵薪階級。現在我們更補充建議數點如次：</p>
<p>（一）在上海無正當職業，或並無職業而企圖投機營生者，或雖有職業而收入微薄無法維持生活者，應從速疏散回鄉。數年以來，各地來滬避居人數極多，彼輩在原籍均有住所財產，來滬僑居原一時趨避，在滬本無正當職業，惟略籌資本，初做棉紗外匯烚赤，其後囤貨投機，更後買賣股票，甚至出入於南市　博塲中，視此等事爲「職業」而維持僑寓生活者。現在環境，已非昔比，過去視爲黃金時代者，現在已無機可投，正應及時還鄉。其次，在上海無正當職業或雖有職業不足維持生活者，與其在滬日坐愁城，餐餐挨餓，不如挈眷還鄉，至少對於吃食問題容易解決。我們希望市機關設立協助回鄉登記處對於請求資助回鄉者予以登記，並資助回鄉旅費，一方面由政府與華中鐵道當局及各輪船公司船公司接洽，指定交通工具，搭載回鄉人民。更進一步，依據保甲調查，對無正當職業者，縱可自力維持生活，亦促令回鄉，以減少上海食糧消耗，維持一般必須留滬工作者的食糧問題。</p>
<p>（二）提倡搭食雜糧。原來食糧中除米以外，尚有苞米，麥類荳類，山芋等等，均可果腹。在江北各地不產米而只產雜糧地域，原以雜糧爲經常食糧。在營養價值上言，雜糧絕不下於米穀。上海人士每有一種錯覺，以爲雜糧是下等人所吃，甚至是畜類所吃。可是，目前的事實，能有雜糧可吃，已屬不易。希望市民，認清現實，矯正重米而輕視雜糧的錯覺，在平日膳食中搭用雜糧，以期減少米糧需要的嚴重性。</p>
<p>最後，希望市府當局趕速採辦米穀及雜糧，辦理米糧，平　對象，先爲勞動者及微薪階級。冷天的民食問題，米價高漲問題，非從積極消極，治本治標各方面施以對策，未易獲得實際成效，願當局督導於上，市民遵從於下，共同亟起圖之。</p>
<h3>日軍已佔領撒特比先波爾圍攻中　哥希馬方面戰鬥將益猛烈</h3>
<p>仰光十三日中央社電　進攻比先波爾之日軍部隊，其後陸續增强新兵力，六日晨對該地周圍之敵軍輸型防衛陣展開攻勢，由於步兵·砲兵及工兵等之勇敢奮鬥，是日夕刻佔領撒特（比先波爾西南十公里），並同庫維莫爾（比先波爾西南八公里）急追敗敵。該方面日軍精銳更猛攻波薩哈附近，復與比先波爾西北育羅克附近之友軍取得連絡，刻正增强進攻比先波爾之攻勢中。</p>
<p>仰光十三日中央社電　敵軍日前往狂奔於伊姆法爾至比先波爾間，盡全力企圖阻止日軍進擊，連日因日軍猛攻，終歸屈服，並已放棄該方面之活動。巴列爾方面之部隊，亦轉往哥希馬，以全力打開血路，向東方脫退，即於七日以戰車二十餘輛，兵力千餘，開始向日軍五點五二一高地（伊姆法爾北方二十公里）突入·經當地日軍擊後，於七日已被擊毀戰車十數輛，敵方喪失大半　力。於人日敵軍似仍作無謂之攻擊，前於該方面之戰鬥，必將益趨猛烈。</p>
<h3>長沙外轉綫戰事極猛烈　豫嵩縣周圍亦激戰中</h3>
<p>里斯本十三日中央社電　重慶來電稱：刻下日軍正對長沙城壁加以砲擊中。</p>
<p>廣州十三日中央社電　據渝方中央社消息，渝軍事委員會十二日發表，長沙郊外之激戰，至十一日愈加猛烈，日軍畫夜於熾烈砲擊掩護下，舉全力前來攻擊，激戰終日，雙方損害甚大。日軍於長沙東方約二十公里之地點企圖渡過瀏陽河，又於長沙東北四公里地點擬渡過撈刀河，長沙東方六十公里劉陽方面之作戰，刻正激烈進行中。又日軍於洞庭湖南岸益陽方面，已進至益陽東南方面蘭溪南方十公里之地點，一方日機十二日晨協力前綫日軍作戰，十一日下午空襲　鄉，曾使數處起火。</p>
<p>里斯本十三日中央據重慶來電，渝軍當局十二日發表湖南及河南之戰況如次：（一）湖南戰綫日軍，自十一日晨至深夜，由長沙四周尚長沙市勇猛追擊，該市外圍防禦綫之戰事，已達最激烈階段，自東方進擊中之日軍部隊，業已佔據距長沙九公里半之，企圖進渡最後防禦綫之瀏陽河。（一）河南戰綫在隴海沿綫靈賓南方地區之戰事，依然繼續，洛陽南方嵩縣周圍亦正激戰中，日軍待戰車隊抵達後，即將進擊，嵩縣方面目下戰事，已移轉至該市之東方。</p>
<p>洛陽十三日中央社電　日軍攻陷洛陽後，已打通直衝西方之路，使渝方深爲狼狽，胡宗南正積極防備西安，調集部隊，嚴守潼關，湯恩伯殘部，則重整旗鼓，在嵩縣附近，使副參謀長劉展緒激勵部下，並要求蔣介石派空軍轟炸嵩縣，而企圖反攻。第一戰區司令蔣鼎文，仍與湯恩伯協力，以受日軍挺進隊猛攻，刻正以盧氏方面爲根據，努力整頓陣容，河南戰綫之日軍，以洛陽陷落爲一轉機，刻正嚴爲監視敵軍之反攻企圖，而亦在整頓戰綫中。</p>
<p>廣州十三日中央社電　據渝方中央社消息，渝方十二日發表，河南省方面之戰鬥刻已於該省西部繼續進行中，尤以靈賓（隴海綫要圖）附近最爲激烈。</p>
<p>「河南作戰意義」日本大本營陸軍部廣播</p>
<p>東京十二日中央社電　日大本營陸軍部特以「河南作戰意義」爲題，廣播如次：重慶中央社會於五月二十九日發表，洛陽陷落後，在軍事上，政治上予重慶以重大打擊，觀此，當可明瞭洛陽陷落之意義如何重大。按渝第一戰區雖由蔣鼎文任總司令官，然實權則操諸請司令湯恩伯手中，湯頗得蔣介石之信賴，渠自本年二月以來，即爲加强河南地區之防備而奔走，且更大事宣傳，所謂六月總反攻，然此渝方直系精銳部隊，於短時期內實行總反攻，結果不但未奏何等效果，反而四散潰逃，此不僅渝方，即利用渝方對日實施反攻之英·美·亦爲之而大失所望，美國所築之空軍根據地，決非爲渝方着想，乃爲彼等自身利益打算，企圖空襲日本土，此次由於日軍先發制人，使駐渝美空軍無從活動，實令人爲之欣快，今美國爲從整旗鼓，特經由印度向渝方實施空中運輸，然每月不足一萬噸之援渝物資中，渝美空軍所使用者竟占七八成之多。又國府發言人亦曾對渝方廣播，其大意謂，今渝方利用其盲目之抗戰心理，而將廣大之土地任英美侵略，此實叛逆者之行爲，今日本實施對華新政策，實不啻爲中國開一光明之途。此次日軍之作戰，乃對英·美所實行之一種軍事行動云云，如上所述，減爲一針見備之快論。河南一帶之穀倉地帶，今日已得免於渝軍之榨取與兵災之禍，且今年河南米麥豐收，其收穫量幾可供三年之用，因平漢綫之打通，華北·華中方面中國民眾已抱有極明朗之希望，當鄭州失守，洛陽淪落時，北平方面物價已降低十分之一至十分之五，北平市民所配給之小麥粉，已增配二成，於是市民對日軍此次佔領非常欣快，是故此次作戰裨益中國民生，誠非淺鮮，該作戰之意義，實即在此云云。</p>
<h3>侵歐作戰聲中　巴爾幹動態　德軍政施策頗見功效</h3>
<p>布達俾斯十三日中央社電　自軸心軍退出羅馬·反軸心軍開始歐洲登陸作戰以來，巴爾幹各國情勢，驟形緊張，但對於德軍之充實準備，却增增依賴，故不見有任何險惡徵兆。無寗謂巴爾幹各國關心之重點有二：（一）爲蘇軍對喀爾巴阡山脈洪牙利方面，及多瑙河三角洲方面，方面之攻勢，其次則爲反軸心軍進駐羅馬後，或在亞特里亞海對岸登陸，或在希臘方面登陸，且嚴開巴爾幹作戰之可能性，并其對於蘇軍攻擊之關心，實可謂達於極點。土耳其方面頻頻傳稱之東地中海反軸心軍行動活潑化等消息，亦深惹人注目。至此種情勢下，最堪尋味之事有三：其（一）洪牙利首相新參謀總長，訪問德元首行營，被認爲含有洪牙利對德軍盡量協力之韻味。（二）保加利亞軍精銳亦担當洪牙利第一綫之防備，傳已擬妥新動員預定計劃，一部已行動員，此兩國之新動向，已顯示羅馬尼亞全國抗蘇態勢之强化，及德國把握巴爾幹之力量。（三）克羅地亞亦正協力德軍，掃蕩蒂托殘部。又土耳其進攻作戰，亦使人深爲關心，土政界一部英美派，已有活躍之概，不論將來釀成何等事態，今日之土耳其自有較從來加倍警戒之價值。總之，德國對於此兩綫正面作戰所苦心經營之軍政各種施策，至今已頗見功效。</p>
<h3>義境德軍右翼　主力北撤</h3>
<p>柏林十三日中央社電　海通社訊：義境德軍之避難行動，仍照原定計劃進行，因地勢關係，德軍右翼之撤退極爲迅速，亞特里亞海岸之德軍因亞平寗山地險阻，故行動較爲遲緩，羅馬以北德軍主力則已撤至蒙帝伏爾西尼</p>
<h3>北法戰事重心　移維爾河上游　卡倫坦東南大戰方酣</h3>
<p>柏林十三日中央社電　德軍當局十二日發表：美軍戰軍隊於蒙受極大犧牲後，得突入卡倫坦市內。</p>
<p>柏林十三日中央社電　德軍當局十二日發表：反軸心軍已在維爾河登陸。</p>
<p>柏林十三日中央社電　德軍當局十二日發表：維爾河上游附近之桑洛外側，已成反軸心軍之新攻擊目標。</p>
<p>柏林十三日中央社電　海通計訊：據可靠消息，美軍在卡倫坦與茜格尼間進攻，圖切斷諾曼第半島，於昨晨佔領卡倫坦，在維爾河東岸建立橋　頭堡後，已陷膠着狀態，此次進攻並未能切斷瑟半島。美軍坦克車隊北攻瑟堡者，已調至維爾河方面。反軸心軍現移目標於維爾河中部之桑洛（St.Lo），澈軍企圖由此西進至諾曼第半島西岸，德軍扼守桑洛外萊勒要隘（Lele　pass），可以寡擊眾，故大戰尚未展開。英軍於昨日在塞灣南面克恩與勃萊特維爾間，以坦克車應戰，以圖擴展其橋頭堡，並仍由軍艦砲火掩護。</p>
<p>要塞守軍寗死不降</p>
<p>柏林十三日中央社電　據前綫消息：在反軸心軍包圍中之一沿岸要塞司令　爾柯上校，向下歐軍　　司令部報告稱：職等決　　希特勒元首之命令，　與敵軍奮戰到底。</p>
<p>虎型坦克參加反攻</p>
<p>瑞典京城十三日中央社電海通社訊·美合眾社　員消息稱：德軍瑞以六十噸之虎型坦克車，在卡倫坦東南約三十哩之蒂——蘇勒前方發動反攻，企圖　形突入敵海濱一帶陣地以達於海·英國軍隊現正死戰，扼守該處陣地。并稱德空軍抵抗力增强，但究屬局部性質，抑係大空戰之開端，則尚難確定。</p>
<p>敵橋頭堡範圍擴大</p>
<p>柏林十三日中央社電　據軍當憶發表稱：自登陸作戰開始以來，至第七日反軸心軍之橋頭堡，橫達八十公里，從達十六公里。</p>
<p>哈密爾機擊落七架</p>
<p>柏林十三日中央社電　德軍夜間戰鬥機隊，十一日夜擊潰有力英夜間戰鬥機隊，猛擊反軸心空輸部隊，擊落英哈密爾登型大型滑翔機七架，按哈密爾滑翔機，全長較四引擎轟炸機尤大能搭載中型戰車，可容兵員百二十名。</p>
<h3>邱吉爾等　視察前綫</h3>
<p>里斯本十三日中央社電　英首相邱吉爾曾於十二日偕南非首相斯末資，視察北法前綫及美軍僅保之橋頭堡。</p>
<h3>羅斯福廣播　闡述戰局</h3>
<p>里斯本十三日中央社電　據華盛頓電：羅斯福昨日廣播，其大旨謂：反軸心軍刻分三條戰綫攻擊德國，法北部登陸作戰中，反軸心軍於人力上物力上之消耗非常鉅大，但仍較預期者爲少。現集結於英本土之武器軍需品數百萬噸及兵員數十萬，業已陸續運抵歐洲戰塲，此種狀態今後仍須繼續維時。今登陸作戰正在熾烈進行中，但吾人並不能因此次發動法北部登陸戰而不關心世界各地戰綫，良以吾人苟未能認識一切戰綫之相互關係，則對於每一戰綫之重要性，亦不能作正當之估計也。</p>
<h3>日前駐義大使　堀切氏返國</h3>
<p>東京十三日中央社電　日前駐義特命全權大使堀切善岳衛氏·十三日下午經西伯利亞歸返東京，該大使于昭和十五年（民國二十九年）十二月赴羅馬，盡瘁敦　日·義邦交，昭和十八年日高大使抵羅馬後，氏即以特命令權大使資格，歷訪歐洲各地，對於日戰時外交貢獻甚大。</p>
<p>德空軍主力出動法沿岸空戰猛烈</p>
<p>予侵歐軍以嚴重打擊</p>
<p>柏林十三日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：較大之德戰鬥機編　，十二日與數量優越之敵機發生多次空戰，並在諾曼第沿岸上空作巡羅之飛行。當德機實行空製時，與英美戰鬥轟炸兩用機發生猛烈空戰，克恩附近更覺劇烈，敵機在數量上雖佔優勢，但結果均被擊退。在空戰進行中，德主力機與戰鬥轟炸兩用機，向敵坦克車縱隊與後方之供應庫，實行低飛襲擊，引起多處大火與爆炸，並以機槍掃射，予英　美步兵嚴重之死傷，敵軍若干　中彈起火。</p>
<p>里斯本十三日中央社電　北法戰爭自開始以來，反軸心軍已出動有力空軍，協助陸軍作戰，因之德空軍勢力較呈微弱，此爲北法戰局最堪注目之特異現象。迨十二日天氣恢復，爲空軍活動之最好機會，故待機中之德空軍主力亦即時出動。據倫敦來電，敵方亦予承認，路透記者亦報稱，德空　軍已決與反軸心空軍決一雌雄，十二日德軍戰鬥機隊已開始活動於北法各戰綫。同時反軸心空軍亦繼續向北法派遣，於北法上空最近似將展開激烈空戰。</p>
<h3>特魯克島上空　曾展開激戰</h3>
<p>襲馬諾卡利敵機受挫</p>
<p>東京十三日中央社電　敵B38型機十三架，十日來襲特魯克島，十一日上午復以該型機二十六架來襲，日軍所有戰鬥機隊當即與之展開激戰，於十日擊落其二架，十一日擊落其一架，日方無損失。又十日上午敵B24型機十八架，P38型機十五架，來襲西部新幾內亞之馬諾卡利，經日機邀擊，擊落其四架後，餘均遁走。</p>
<h3>平心靜氣論中國  湯澤三千男</h3>
<p>日本一萬萬國民，一時一刻都不能忘記：大東亞戰爭，是對於援助重慶殘餘政權，挑撥東亞混亂，以和平為名思得東亞領導權為實的英美，予一當頭棒喝，粉碎其伸入東亞的魔掌，以奠定東亞永的和平。</p>
<p>我和中國過去是沒有很多緣份的。然於一九三八年春，曾受聘華北派遺軍及臨時政府的行政顧問約二年，其間曾在戰火彌漫中，協助各種建設事業，於是我漸漸對中國發生了深切的關心和親愛的感情。凡與中國多少發生過關係的人，中有八九全與人拖着同樣的感想，縱令同一東亞，但他國所無者，而中國全有。這是證明中國是地大　　人家的國家。</p>
<p>中國問題，凡留華一月者，或五六的日本老僑民，甚至從未見過中國人者，都能加以頭頭是道的批評。歐美人中。完全不懂中文和漢字者，也有成為世界着名的中國問題研究專家者。我對於中國的感想，當然也不外乎人云的膚綫之論。我希望日本同胞特別應當注意者，是近代中國人的愛國精神。</p>
<p>一談到中國人，說會聯想到猶太人那麼自私自利，或損人利已，缺乏國家觀念，毫無民族意議的。但近代的中國階層，中國知識份子，決不見這類被人嗤之以鼻的人了。</p>
<p>七七事變之初，我們日本人都沒有看到這一點。大家都曾臆測：攻克南京，則蔣氏政權即將屈服吧！此次大東亞戰爭爆發，大家都曾過高估計了英美蔣氏政權即將土崩瓦解等。然而，臆測目臆測，而未能實現，同時，反乎我們臆測的這般事實，如最近美國駐華空軍的加强，以及緬印和中緬國境綫上有力蠢動的渝軍情形，都日益加多。蔣氏政權雖然決不會鞏固起來，然而民眾的抗日意識，却不會那樣衰頹下去的。</p>
<p>這空間是怎一回事呢？我們日本國民業已曉得，這是因為中國中堅階層的知識份子，有一種如火如荼的强烈愛國精神所致。</p>
<p>其根本精神，就是一致對外的思想，尤其是與共產黨結成一氣的所謂抗戰意識。這種反日情緒，業已根深蒂固，見者還和深入於民間。不要忽略，領導中國政治的人物，國民政府方面的也好，蔣氏政權方面的也好，其精神都非自私自利的，而是很有捨已救人的愛國至情。不要逃避現實，而要正視中國有力指導者間。澎湃洶涌的這種保衛祖國和解放民族的崇高精神。</p>
<p>中國的人民大眾，不待言，八九成為農民，他們是昏昏堊堊，無知無職，都抱有　　上給誰納糧的思想。但統率和領導這一階級的知識份子，却是滿腔熱血，而誓死保衛中華民族的愛國者。</p>
<p>他們的祖先，過去為了拯救祖國的危難，而曾參加鴉片戰爭，太平天國起義，廣東政變，義和國事件等，是以英勇精神，自我犧牲，想驅逐歐美帝國主義的思想。這樣具有傳統性的中堅階層，如大學生和小學敎師，心原上都熊熊燃燒着抗日烈火，源源不斷地達到他們認為負　頑抗的重慶政權是盡忠報國的所在去。假如使這樣具有强烈愛國熱情的中國青年中堅份子，相信日本帝國的最高理想，於是中國民眾才能覺悟抗戰之非，進而籠罩全中國的戰爭火焰，自形消滅，而即產生中國人所最愛好的和平，但爭取這批中國知識份子的信服，誠是一件艱苦的工作。就是說，七七事變以來，日本究竟獲得中國民心到何種程度，這是必很深加反省的。</p>
<p>關於這一點，我記得不久前（今年二月五日），陸軍大佐　政信氏於上海，曾發表過「我以前曾辦轉變各地·最初在江　　和豪廷楷的十九路軍會作戰過，後來在山西與重慶中央軍也曾作戰過，在諾門坎與蘇聯軍也曾作戰過，在馬萊與英印軍也曾作戰過，在雁打與美菲軍也曾作戰過，在所羅門與美澳軍也曾作戰過，但軍隊之强，第一應數中國」假如以同樣配備而在同樣戰塲上作戰的話，則中國的中央軍是首屈一指的。其次就是蘇聯的軍隊，這因為有東方人的血液。再其次就是美國·英國·澳洲。假如這個强而有力的中國，和更强一籌的我們日本，二者全面合作的話，我堅信，全世界各國縱來反對我們這樣世界第一的最强五萬之人民，也是不足權的。中國强勝吧一努力强勝吧！同時我們更强一步。</p>
<p>迂大佐又說：「一百萬駐華的日本軍政民三界，如每人都獲得一位中國同志，即以一百萬中國人為眞正的知已同志，則事變理應迎刃而解。重慶在注視着上海的現狀。重慶在靜靜的注視着，日本的新政策究竟是眞的呢？抑是假的呢？在上海這一新方針如能不折不扣而十足兌現時，事變則立刻解決」。</p>
<p>迂大佐當知道奉化的蔣介石先母墳，無人修葺時，即發軍令舉辦七天的慰靈法會道塲，而向世人表示薄厚道義的日本武士之「眞心實意」。在敵我最前綫而等於敵地的所在，竟舉行這樣事懷，那末除日本人外，還有那國人肯作呢？解決大東亞戰爭，在於處理中國問題上。想念及此，則令人討厭的中國抗戰意識，也是出於愛護祖國的眞誠至情，同時對於日本說，這一點　也是可能構成强而有力的同志條件。每個日本同胞，都能爭取到中國人心的向往，而使政府能有效地實現言行一致的對羣政策。只有這樣才早擊潰英美的康莊大道。（魯譯自五月二十八日讀賣報知星期評議）</p>

<h3>Countermeasures to the Food Problem</h3>
<p>According to general estimates, Shanghai has a population of five million, with the First District being particularly densely populated. Shanghai is a city, not a rural area, and does not produce grain. In other words, the five million people in Shanghai are all consumers of rice and grain, not producers. Therefore, when rice and grain become a problem, Shanghai feels it especially acutely. The current rice and grain problem facing Shanghai is a concrete illustration of this.</p>
<p>After rice prices rose again in the past week, they have now reached a natural standstill. The relevant authorities are actively trying to procure supplies and unblock sources, as well as crack down on hoarding and manipulation. However, before effective regulatory measures are obtained, rather than simply hoping that rice prices will fall, it is better to earnestly do a few things that can promote a decline in prices, doing one thing at a time, even if it's only a small step.</p>
<p>In our editorial on the tenth of this month, we made a suggestion that the municipal authorities should raise funds, or borrow cash from national banks, to purchase rice and grains and distribute them specifically to laborers and wage earners. Now we further supplement this with the following suggestions:</p>
<p>(1) Those in Shanghai who have no legitimate occupation, or who have no occupation and attempt to engage in speculative business, or who have an occupation but whose income is too meager to maintain a living, should be promptly dispersed back to their hometowns. In recent years, a large number of people from various places have come to Shanghai to seek refuge. These people all have residences and property in their hometowns. Coming to Shanghai for temporary refuge was originally a temporary expedient. They have no legitimate occupation in Shanghai, but only raise a small amount of capital and initially speculate in cotton yarn and foreign exchange. Later, they hoard goods for speculation, and even later buy and sell stocks, and even frequent the gambling dens in the South City, regarding such things as "occupations" to maintain their expatriate lives. The current environment is not what it used to be. What was once considered a golden age now offers no opportunities for speculation. They should return to their hometowns in a timely manner. Secondly, those in Shanghai who have no legitimate occupation or whose occupation is insufficient to maintain a living, rather than sitting in Shanghai worrying and starving every meal, should take their families back to their hometowns, at least making it easier to solve the problem of food. We hope that the municipal authorities will set up a registration office to assist in returning to hometowns, register those who request assistance in returning to their hometowns, and provide subsidies for travel expenses. On the one hand, the government should contact the China Central Railway Authority and various shipping companies to designate means of transportation to carry people back to their hometowns. Furthermore, according to the 保甲 (bao jia) system, those without legitimate occupations, even if they can maintain a living on their own, should also be urged to return to their hometowns in order to reduce Shanghai's food consumption and maintain the food supply for those who must stay in Shanghai to work.</p>
<p>(2) Promote the consumption of mixed grains. Originally, in addition to rice, there are also corn, wheat, beans, sweet potatoes, etc., that can fill the stomach. In the Jiangbei areas that do not produce rice but only produce miscellaneous grains, miscellaneous grains are the regular food. In terms of nutritional value, miscellaneous grains are by no means inferior to rice. People in Shanghai often have a misconception that miscellaneous grains are eaten by the lower classes, or even by livestock. However, the current reality is that it is not easy to have miscellaneous grains to eat. We hope that citizens will recognize the reality, correct the misconception of valuing rice and despising miscellaneous grains, and use miscellaneous grains in their daily meals in order to reduce the seriousness of the need for rice.</p>
<p>Finally, we hope that the municipal authorities will quickly procure rice and grains, manage the rice and grain supply, and offer fair prices, first to laborers and low-wage earners. The problem of food for the people in cold weather and the problem of high rice prices cannot be effectively resolved without taking active and passive countermeasures from all aspects, both fundamental and symptomatic. We hope that the authorities will supervise from above and the citizens will comply from below, and together strive to solve the problem.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Army Has Occupied Sattibi Near Bixianpol and Is Besieging It; Fighting Near Kohima Will Intensify</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Rangoon, 13th – The Japanese army units attacking Bixianpol have been continuously reinforced with new troops. On the morning of the 6th, they launched an offensive against the enemy's strong defensive positions around the area. Due to the brave fighting of the infantry, artillery, and engineers, they occupied Sattibi (ten kilometers southwest of Bixianpol) by evening and rapidly pursued the defeated enemy along with Kubimore (eight kilometers southwest of Bixianpol). The elite Japanese troops in that area are fiercely attacking near Posaha and have re-established contact with friendly forces near Yurok, northwest of Bixianpol, and are currently intensifying their offensive against Bixianpol.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Rangoon, 13th – The enemy army rushed madly between Imphal and Bixianpol, doing its best to stop the Japanese army's advance. After days of fierce attacks by the Japanese army, they finally succumbed and have abandoned their activities in that area. The troops in the Parrel area have also moved to Kohima to open a path of escape eastward with all their strength. On the 7th, with more than 20 tanks and over 1,000 troops, they began to break into Japanese-held Hill 5.521 (20 kilometers north of Imphal). After being attacked by the local Japanese troops, more than a dozen tanks were destroyed on the 7th, and the enemy lost most of its strength. On the 8th, the enemy seemed to be making futile attacks. The fighting in that area will inevitably become more intense.</p>
<h3>The Battle Outside Changsha Is Extremely Fierce; Heavy Fighting Is Also Taking Place Around Songxian County in Henan Province</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 13th – A dispatch from Chongqing states that the Japanese army is currently bombarding the walls of Changsha.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 13th – According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Chongqing, the Chongqing Military Affairs Commission announced on the 12th that the fierce fighting outside Changsha intensified on the 11th. Under the cover of intense bombardment day and night, the Japanese army launched an all-out attack. After a day of intense fighting, both sides suffered heavy losses. The Japanese army attempted to cross the Liuyang River about 20 kilometers east of Changsha, and also attempted to cross the Laodao River four kilometers northeast of Changsha. The fighting in Liuyang, 60 kilometers east of Changsha, is currently raging. In addition, the Japanese army in Yiyang on the south bank of Dongting Lake has advanced to a point ten kilometers south of Lanxi, southeast of Yiyang. Japanese aircraft cooperated with the frontline Japanese army on the morning of the 12th and bombed Xiangxiang in the afternoon, causing several fires.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 13th – According to a dispatch from Chongqing, the Chongqing military authorities announced the battle situation in Hunan and Henan on the 12th as follows: (1) On the Hunan front, from the morning to late at night of the 11th, the Japanese army around Changsha fiercely pursued Changsha City. The fighting on the outer defensive line of the city has reached its most intense stage. The Japanese troops advancing from the east have occupied a position nine and a half kilometers from Changsha, attempting to cross the last defensive line, the Liuyang River. (2) On the Henan front, the fighting in the Lingbao area south of the Longhai Railway line continues. Heavy fighting is also taking place around Songxian County south of Luoyang. The Japanese army will advance after the tank units arrive. The fighting in Songxian is now shifting to the east of the city.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Luoyang, 13th – After the Japanese army captured Luoyang, it opened a direct path to the west, causing great embarrassment to Chongqing. Hu Zongnan is actively defending Xi'an, gathering troops, and strictly guarding Tongguan. The remnants of Tang Enbo's army are reorganizing their forces near Songxian, with Deputy Chief of Staff Liu Zhanxu encouraging his subordinates and requesting Chiang Kai-shek to send air force to bomb Songxian in an attempt to counterattack. Jiang Dingwen, commander of the First War Zone, is still working with Tang Enbo. Under fierce attacks by Japanese commandoes, they are now using Lushi as their base and working hard to reorganize their formation. The Japanese army on the Henan front is taking the fall of Luoyang as a turning point and is closely monitoring the enemy's counterattack attempts while also reorganizing its front lines.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 13th – According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Chongqing, Chongqing announced on the 12th that the fighting in Henan Province is continuing in the western part of the province, especially fierce near Lingbao (a key point on the Longhai Railway line).</p>
<p>"Significance of the Henan Operation" Broadcast by the Japanese Army Headquarters</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 12th – The Japanese Army Headquarters broadcast the following under the title "Significance of the Henan Operation": The Chongqing Central Society announced on May 29 that the fall of Luoyang has dealt a major blow to Chongqing militarily and politically. From this, it is clear how significant the fall of Luoyang is. Although Jiang Dingwen is the commander-in-chief of the First War Zone in Chongqing, the real power is in the hands of Commander Tang Enbo. Tang enjoys Chiang Kai-shek's trust and has been working to strengthen the defenses of the Henan area since February of this year, and has also promoted the so-called general counteroffensive in June. However, this elite direct-line troop of Chongqing not only failed to achieve any results in carrying out the general counteroffensive in a short period of time, but also collapsed and fled in all directions. This is not only true for Chongqing, but also for Britain and the United States, which used Chongqing to launch a counteroffensive against Japan. The air bases built by the United States were not built for Chongqing's sake, but for their own interests, in an attempt to bomb Japan. This time, the Japanese army took preemptive action, preventing the U.S. air force stationed in Chongqing from operating, which is gratifying. Now, the United States is reorganizing its forces and conducting aerial transport to Chongqing via India. However, of the less than 10,000 tons of aid materials transported to Chongqing each month, 70-80% is used by the Chongqing-U.S. air force. In addition, the spokesperson of the National Government also broadcast to Chongqing, saying that Chongqing is now using its blind resistance mentality to allow Britain and the United States to invade its vast territory, which is the act of a traitor. Now Japan is implementing a new policy towards China, which is no less than opening a bright path for China. This Japanese military operation is a military action against Britain and the United States, as mentioned above, which is a quick and insightful comment. The granary area in Henan has now been spared the exploitation and war disasters of the Chongqing army, and this year Henan has a bumper harvest of rice and wheat, with a harvest that can last for almost three years. Because of the opening of the Pinghan Railway, the Chinese people in North China and Central China have very bright hopes. When Zhengzhou fell and Luoyang fell, prices in Beiping fell by 10% to 50%. The allocation of wheat flour to Beiping citizens has increased by 20%. Therefore, the citizens are very happy about the Japanese army's occupation this time. Therefore, this operation is of great benefit to the livelihood of the Chinese people, which is by no means insignificant. The significance of this operation lies in this.</p>
<h3>Amidst the Sounds of the Invasion of Europe: The Situation in the Balkans; Germany's Military and Political Measures Are Quite Effective</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Budapest, 13th – Since the Axis forces withdrew from Rome and the anti-Axis forces began landing operations in Europe, the situation in the Balkan countries has suddenly become tense. However, they are increasingly relying on the German army's full preparations, so there are no signs of any dangerous omens. It is said that the focus of attention of the Balkan countries is twofold: (1) The offensive of the Soviet army against the Carpathian Mountains in Hungary and the Danube Delta; secondly, the possibility of the anti-Axis forces entering Rome, landing on the other side of the Adriatic Sea, or landing in Greece, and launching a Balkan operation, and their concern about the Soviet army's attack is said to be at its peak. The news frequently transmitted from Turkey that the anti-Axis forces' activities in the eastern Mediterranean are becoming more active is also attracting attention. Under this situation, the most thought-provoking things are three: First, the new Chief of Staff of the Hungarian Prime Minister visited the German leader's headquarters, which is considered to imply Hungary's full cooperation with the German army. (2) The elite troops of the Bulgarian army are also responsible for the defense of Hungary's front line, and it is said that a new mobilization plan has been prepared, and part of it has already been mobilized. These new trends in the two countries have shown the strengthening of Romania's anti-Soviet posture and Germany's ability to control the Balkans. (3) Croatia is also cooperating with the German army to wipe out Tito's remnants. In addition, Turkey's offensive operation is also of great concern. Some pro-British and American factions in the Turkish political circles have become active. No matter what kind of situation will develop in the future, today's Turkey has more value for vigilance than ever before. In short, Germany's military and political measures, which have been painstakingly managed for these two fronts, have been quite effective so far.</p>
<h3>The Main Force of the German Army on the Right Wing in Italy Is Withdrawing Northward</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 13th – Huitong News Agency reports: The German army's evacuation operation in Italy is still proceeding according to the original plan. Due to the terrain, the withdrawal of the German army on the right wing is very rapid. The German army on the Adriatic coast is moving more slowly due to the obstacles of the Apennine Mountains. The main force of the German army north of Rome has withdrawn to Monte Vercino.</p>
<h3>The Focus of the Battle in Northern France Shifts to the Upper Reaches of the Vire River; A Fierce Battle Is Underway Southeast of Carentan</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 13th – The German military authorities announced on the 12th that the U.S. military troops, after suffering heavy casualties, managed to break into the city of Carentan.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 13th – The German military authorities announced on the 12th that the anti-Axis forces have landed on the Vire River.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 13th – The German military authorities announced on the 12th that the area outside Saint-Lo near the upper reaches of the Vire River has become a new target of the anti-Axis forces' attacks.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 13th – Huitong News reports: According to reliable sources, the U.S. military attacked between Carentan and Seigny in an attempt to cut off the Normandy Peninsula. They occupied Carentan yesterday morning and established a bridgehead on the east bank of the Vire River, which has fallen into a stalemate. This attack failed to cut off the Cherbourg Peninsula. The U.S. tank units that attacked Cherbourg to the north have been transferred to the Vire River area. The anti-Axis forces are now shifting their target to Saint-Lo in the middle of the Vire River. The Cher army is attempting to advance westward from here to the west coast of the Normandy Peninsula. The German army is guarding the Lele pass outside Saint-Lo, which can defeat the many with the few, so the great battle has not yet begun. Yesterday, the British army fought with tanks between Caen and Bretteville south of the Seine Bay in an attempt to expand its bridgehead and is still protected by naval gunfire.</p>
<p>The Garrison Is Determined to Die Rather Than Surrender</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 13th – According to front-line news: Colonel Erke, the commander of a coastal fortress surrounded by anti-Axis forces, reported to the command of the Lower Army: We are determined to follow the orders of the Führer Hitler and fight the enemy to the end.</p>
<p>Tiger Tanks Participate in the Counterattack</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Stockholm, 13th – Huitong News Agency reports: According to a United Press staff member, the German army launched a counterattack with sixty-ton Tiger tanks in front of Thierville, about thirty miles southeast of Carentan, in an attempt to break through the enemy's coastal positions and reach the sea. The British army is currently fighting to the death to hold the position. It is also said that the German air force's resistance has increased, but it is difficult to determine whether it is local in nature or the beginning of a major air battle.</p>
<p>The Enemy's Bridgehead Expands</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 13th – According to the military, the anti-Axis forces' bridgehead, from the start of the landing operation to the seventh day, stretched 80 kilometers horizontally and 16 kilometers vertically.</p>
<p>Hamilton Aircraft Shot Down Seven</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 13th – The German night fighter squadron crushed a powerful British night fighter squadron on the night of the 11th, violently attacking the anti-Axis airborne troops and shooting down seven large British Hamilton gliders. The Hamilton glider is longer than a four-engine bomber and can carry medium-sized tanks and 120 soldiers.</p>
<h3>Churchill and Others Inspect the Front Line</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 13th – British Prime Minister Churchill, accompanied by South African Prime Minister Smuts, inspected the northern French front line and the American-held bridgehead on the 12th.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Broadcasts, Explaining the Battle Situation</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 13th – According to a dispatch from Washington: Roosevelt broadcast yesterday, saying in essence: The anti-Axis forces are currently attacking Germany on three fronts. In the landing operation in northern France, the consumption of the anti-Axis forces in terms of manpower and material resources is very large, but still less than expected. Millions of tons of weapons and military supplies and hundreds of thousands of soldiers gathered in the British mainland have been successively transported to the European theater, and this situation must continue to be maintained in the future. The landing operation is currently in full swing, but we cannot ignore the battle lines around the world because of this landing operation in northern France. If we fail to recognize the interrelationship of all the battle lines, we cannot properly estimate the importance of each battle line.</p>
<h3>Former Ambassador to Italy, Mr. Horikiri, Returns Home</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 13th – Mr. Horikiri Zen'ei, former Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to Italy, returned to Tokyo via Siberia on the afternoon of the 13th. The ambassador went to Rome in December of Showa 15 (1940) and devoted himself to strengthening the relationship between Japan and Italy. After Ambassador Nichitaka arrived in Rome in Showa 18, Mr. Horikiri visited various parts of Europe as an Ambassador Extraordinary and contributed greatly to Japan's wartime diplomacy.</p>
<p>The Main Force of the German Air Force Is Dispatched: Fierce Air Battle on the French Coast</p>
<p>Inflicting Serious Damage on the Invading European Army</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 13th – German News Agency reports: A larger formation of German fighters engaged in multiple air battles with superior numbers of enemy aircraft on the 12th, and patrolled over the Normandy coast. When the German aircraft implemented air control, fierce air battles broke out with British and American fighter-bombers. The area near Caen was even more intense. Although the enemy aircraft were superior in number, they were eventually repelled. During the air battle, German main force aircraft and fighter-bombers carried out low-altitude attacks on enemy tank columns and rear supply depots, causing multiple fires and explosions, and used machine guns to strafe, inflicting serious casualties on British and American infantry. Some enemy tanks caught fire after being hit.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 13th – Since the beginning of the war in northern France, the anti-Axis forces have dispatched a powerful air force to assist the army in combat. As a result, the German air force's strength has been relatively weak, which is the most noteworthy special phenomenon in the northern French war situation. On the 12th, the weather recovered, providing the best opportunity for air force activity, so the main force of the German air force that was waiting for an opportunity was dispatched immediately. According to a dispatch from London, the enemy also admitted that a Reuters reporter reported that the German air force had decided to compete with the anti-Axis air force. On the 12th, the German fighter squadron had begun to operate on all fronts in northern France. At the same time, the anti-Axis air force continued to send troops to northern France, and a fierce air battle is likely to unfold in the skies of northern France recently.</p>
<h3>A Fierce Battle Unfolded Over Truk Island</h3>
<p>Enemy Aircraft Repelled Attacking Manokwari</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 13th – Thirteen enemy B38 aircraft attacked Truk Island on the 10th. On the morning of the 11th, 26 aircraft of the same type attacked again. All Japanese fighter squadrons immediately engaged them in a fierce battle, shooting down two on the 10th and one on the 11th. There were no losses on the Japanese side. In addition, on the morning of the 10th, 18 enemy B24 aircraft and 15 P38 aircraft attacked Manokwari in western New Guinea. After being intercepted by Japanese aircraft, four were shot down and the rest fled.</p>
<h3>Impartial and Calm Discussion of China by Mikio Yuzawa</h3>
<p>The 100 million Japanese citizens cannot forget for even a moment: The Greater East Asia War was a head-on blow to England and America, who were aiding the remaining Chongqing regime, stirring up chaos in East Asia, and seeking to gain leadership of East Asia in the name of peace but in reality. It shattered their grasping hands reaching into East Asia and laid the foundation for lasting peace in East Asia.</p>
<p>I didn’t have much connection with China in the past. However, in the spring of 1938, I was hired as an administrative advisor to the North China Dispatch Army and the Provisional Government for about two years. During that time, I assisted in various construction projects amidst the flames of war, and I gradually developed a deep concern and affection for China. Anyone who has had any dealings with China shares the same feelings in eight or nine out of ten cases. Even though it's the same East Asia, China has everything that other countries don’t. This proves that China is a large and populous country.</p>
<p>Regarding the China problem, anyone who has stayed in China for a month, or five or six old Japanese residents, or even those who have never seen a Chinese person, can offer insightful criticism. Among Europeans and Americans, there are those who do not understand Chinese or Chinese characters at all but have become world-renowned experts on Chinese issues. My impressions of China are, of course, nothing more than superficial common opinions. What I hope Japanese compatriots should pay special attention to is the patriotic spirit of modern Chinese people.</p>
<p>Whenever Chinese people are mentioned, people often associate them with Jews, thinking them selfish and self-serving, harming others for their own benefit, lacking a sense of national identity, and devoid of national consciousness. But modern Chinese people, Chinese intellectuals, are definitely not the kind of people who are scorned in this way.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the July 7th Incident, we Japanese did not see this point. Everyone speculated: If we conquer Nanjing, the Chiang regime will surrender! When the Greater East Asia War broke out, everyone overestimated that the English, American, and Chiang regimes would collapse. However, speculation is speculation, and it has not been realized. At the same time, facts contrary to our speculation, such as the recent strengthening of the US Air Force stationed in China, and the active movements of the Chongqing army on the border between Burma, India, and China, are increasing day by day. Although the Chiang regime will never become consolidated, the people's anti-Japanese consciousness will not decline that much.</p>
<p>What is going on? We Japanese citizens already know that this is due to the strong patriotic spirit of the intellectuals in the middle class of China.</p>
<p>The fundamental spirit is the idea of unanimous resistance against foreign enemies, especially the so-called resistance consciousness that has joined forces with the Communist Party. This anti-Japanese sentiment is already deeply rooted and pervasive among the people. Do not ignore that the figures who lead Chinese politics, whether on the side of the National Government or the Chiang regime, are not selfish and self-serving, but have a great patriotic spirit of sacrificing themselves to save others. Do not escape reality, but face squarely the surging spirit of these powerful leaders in China, the noble spirit of defending their homeland and liberating their nation.</p>
<p>The Chinese masses, needless to say, are eighty or ninety percent farmers. They are ignorant and uneducated and only have the thought of paying taxes to whoever is in charge. But the intellectuals who command and lead this class are full of enthusiasm and are patriots who swear to defend the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>Their ancestors, in the past, in order to save the country from danger, participated in the Opium War, the Taiping Rebellion, the Guangdong Coup, and the Boxer Rebellion, etc., with a heroic spirit and self-sacrifice, wanting to expel the imperialism of Europe and America. Such a middle class with tradition, such as university students and elementary school teachers, have a burning anti-Japanese fire in their hearts and constantly reach out to the Chongqing regime, which they believe is the place to be loyal to the country. If these Chinese youth, the mainstay with a strong patriotic enthusiasm, believe in the supreme ideals of the Japanese Empire, then the Chinese people will be able to realize that resistance is wrong, and then the flames of war that engulf the whole of China will disappear on their own, and the peace that the Chinese people love most will be produced. But winning the confidence of this group of Chinese intellectuals is indeed a difficult task. That is to say, since the July 7th Incident, to what extent has Japan gained the hearts of the Chinese people? This is something that must be deeply reflected upon.</p>
<p>Regarding this point, I remember not long ago (February 5th of this year), Army Colonel Masanobu Tsuji, in Shanghai, made a statement: "I have been in charge of turning things around in various places before. At first, I fought against the 19th Route Army of Jiang Guangnai and Cai Tingkai, then I fought against the Central Army of Chongqing in Shanxi, then I fought against the Soviet army in Nomonhan, then I fought against the British and Indian army in Malaya, then I fought against the American and Filipino army in Bataan, and then I fought against the American and Australian army in the Solomon Islands. But the strongest army should be counted as the Chinese." If they fought with the same equipment and on the same battlefield, then the Central Army of China would be second to none. The next is the Soviet army, because they have Eastern blood. Next are the United States, England, and Australia. If this strong and powerful China and our even stronger Japan fully cooperate, I firmly believe that even if all the countries in the world come to oppose our world's strongest five million people, it would not be enough to weigh against us. China, be strong! Strive to be strong! At the same time, we are even stronger.</p>
<p>Colonel Tsuji also said: "If one million Japanese military, government, and civilians stationed in China each gain a Chinese comrade, that is, have one million Chinese people as true intimate comrades, then the incident should be solved easily. Chongqing is watching the current situation in Shanghai. Chongqing is quietly watching: Is Japan's new policy real? Or is it fake? When this new policy in Shanghai can be fully implemented without any discount, the incident will be resolved immediately."</p>
<p>Colonel Tsuji also knew that when Chiang Kai-shek's late mother's tomb in Fenghua was unattended, he issued a military order to hold a seven-day memorial service to show the world the "sincerity" of a Japanese samurai who values morality and righteousness. In the front line of the enemy, which is equal to the enemy's land, such a thing is done. What other country besides Japan would be willing to do this? The solution to the Greater East Asia War lies in dealing with the China problem. Thinking of this, the annoying Chinese resistance consciousness is also out of the sincere feelings of loving the motherland. At the same time, for Japan, this point can also constitute a condition for a strong and powerful comrade. Every Japanese compatriot can win the hearts of the Chinese people, and enable the government to effectively implement a consistent policy towards the masses. Only in this way can we defeat England and America on the broad road. (Translated by Lu from the Yomiuri Hochi Weekly Review, May 28)</p>

<h3>Arrest of Rice Profiteers Under Strict Interrogation</h3>
<p>The Economic Security Division of the First Police Bureau of this city, in view of the recent soaring rice prices, which have seriously affected the people's livelihood, received a secret report on the 11th that a large number of rice merchants were gathering at the Gongping Tea House at 3 Chongqing Road and the Tea House at 7 Shandong Road, suspected of manipulating and hoarding rice. A large number of economic police were immediately dispatched to the above two locations to arrest more than two hundred rice merchants and bring them to the division for investigation. According to reporters, the division is planning to strictly interrogate these rice profiteers separately. Once the investigation is completed, the illegal rice merchants will be transferred to the District Procuratorate and submitted to the court for strict handling in accordance with the law. It is also heard that among these rice profiteers, if it is verified that there are criminals who have committed hoarding and manipulation, they will be sentenced to the extreme penalty to serve as a warning to others, to appease the people's livelihood, which is tantamount to giving the profiteers a head-on blow.</p>

<h3>Closure of Opium Sales and Smoking Dens, Announcement of Handling Measures, Registration of Smokers in Each District</h3>
<p>Regarding the handling of opium sales and smoking dens in this city and the registration of smokers, citizens have been very concerned recently. A reporter from the Central News Agency specially inquired about the details from the Anti-Smoking Bureau of the Ministry of Interior yesterday, which are listed below: There were originally 197 opium sales and smoking dens in Shanghai, of which 100 were registered and approved to be licensed. The remaining 97 must be closed by May 31. The Anti-Smoking Bureau has notified the Preparatory Committee of the Special Industry General Association to inform the merchants with the license and requested the cooperation of the Second Police Bureau to ban them and order them to stop operations. It is now heard that the opium sales and smoking dens that have been licensed will also be completely closed by the end of June. This time, the Anti-Smoking Bureau is purely implementing Article 1, Item 2 of the Central Government's measures to prohibit opium sales and smoking dens within a limited time, and Article 2, Item 2 of the measures to ban opium sales and smoking dens. The registration of smokers in this city in the first to seventh districts is entrusted to the smoker registration offices established by the police bureaus in each district. In addition, the seven districts of Nanhui, Jiading, Chongming, Baoshan, Beiqiao, Fengxian, and Chuansha are handled by the directly affiliated offices of the Anti-Smoking Bureau, with the assistance of the local police authorities at any time. It is now heard that the registration in the area under the jurisdiction of the Second Police Bureau started in March of this month, and the registration in the area under the jurisdiction of the First Police Bureau started on the 10th of this month. It is heard that smokers are still enthusiastically applying for registration because the period within June is a free application registration period. After June 30, it will be the verification registration period. After registering and receiving a license, each smoker can purchase official-priced opium with the license. Otherwise, it is prohibited to purchase opium privately and smoke opium privately. The special industry association organized by the opium sales and smoking dens mentioned in yesterday's newspaper is an office established by members of Group C in the special industry association during the former Anti-Smoking Bureau era, not the special industry association.</p>
<h3>Chinese Rural Construction Association Welcomes Two Professors from Allied Nations</h3>
<p>In order to welcome Professors Shigeji Ito and Kiyoshi Sasaki, two agronomists from the Allied nations who recently came to China, the Chinese Rural Construction Association held a tea party at the Japanese-Chinese Club at 3:00 p.m. yesterday (the 13th). In addition to Professors Ito and Sasaki, the Allied side included Assistant Professor Koyama, General Manager Yamada of the Koda Yarn Factory, Section Chief Sekiya, etc., as well as Committee Member Zhang Guoyuan, Committee Member Zhao Zhengping, Yan Qingxiang, Wang Jingyu, Lu Shuchen, He Weiling, Wang Zhaoji, Fu Dichen, Wu Yechang, and President Chen of this newspaper, and dozens of others. The chairman of the association, Jia Jianan, delivered a welcoming speech first.</p>
<p>Professor Ito's Speech</p>
<p>Professor Ito then delivered a speech, stating: I have not been here for long and do not have a deep understanding of your country's agriculture, but in order to develop China's agriculture, I cannot but pay attention to agricultural economics. However, China's agricultural economics cannot copy the interpretations of Europe and the United States. It must improve China's inherent agricultural economics. To revive China's rural areas, I am confident that the efforts of the agricultural experts present and the members of the Chinese Rural Construction Association will ensure the success of China's agriculture.</p>
<p>Professor Sasaki's Speech</p>
<p>Professor Sasaki then delivered a speech, stating that he was very happy to meet with everyone here after coming to China and was delighted to be able to gather here again. He had recently been to Nanjing, Suzhou, Hangzhou, and other places and learned about the current situation of Chinese agriculture, the policies taken, and the general situation of rural areas. In his personal opinion, the agricultural situation in Central China is very similar to that of Japan, such as the small size of farmland, the main crop being rice, and the livestock being mostly sheep, which are all points common to the two countries. Recently, China has a production increase campaign, and Japan also has a production increase campaign, but the effect of China's production increase campaign is not as significant as that of Japan. For example, the rice production volume is only one-tenth of Japan's, and the livestock production volume is only one-half. Therefore, he firmly believes that if Japan's agricultural technology is imported into China, it will definitely help to complete a part of the production increase work, and the cooperation between China and Japan in agriculture is especially necessary.</p>
<h3>Adjustment of the Administrative Division of the First Bureau, Section Chiefs of Branch Bureaus</h3>
<p>In order to strengthen the administration of each branch bureau, the Administrative Division of the First Police Bureau of this city has specially adjusted the section chiefs of the administrative sections of each branch bureau.
