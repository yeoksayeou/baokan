<p>社評</p>
<h3>實騐縣</h3>
<p>「寶騐」二字本為科學上之一種名詞，</p>
<p>其含義有二：（甲）有理論而無具體施策者</p>
<p>，須先加以小規模之實駝，然後擴而大之以</p>
<p>宏共用。例如一切天然產物之代替品，無論</p>
<p>人造牛油，人造橡皮等，必先確定其化學上</p>
<p>之理論，再經「實駝室」之研討，確定其實</p>
<p>施之方式，使適合於大規模之設廠製造而不</p>
<p>致虧損失敗。（乙）有新穎之方法，而無效</p>
<p>果上確變之把握者，須先在某特種外界條件</p>
<p>之下加以小範圍之實騐，視其成績之優劣而</p>
<p>定其是否值得就同樣之外界條件中普遍推行</p>
<p>。例如新穎之鐵道舖設方法，必先指定一「</p>
<p>實騐段」，在某種機車以某種行駛速率之下</p>
<p>試行採用，若所得經騐誠能與預期之效果相</p>
<p>符，然後改建所有以同樣機車及同樣速率行</p>
<p>駛之路綫，而增進交通工具一般之功能。</p>
<p>最近國防會議重視鄉村建設。而定「實</p>
<p>騐縣」之名稱，更規定共當選之標準，足徵</p>
<p>當局以科學頭腦處理國政，誠無可非議。但</p>
<p>按上述二實豔」之含義，將鄕村建設中之「</p>
<p>實驗縣」加以分析，似有未盡妥吾之處，爰</p>
<p>申說如次，以供有關方面之參考。</p>
<p>一，根據（甲）項而言，按鄉村建設計</p>
<p>劃大綱　第二所載已標明為具體施策，則對</p>
<p>於鄕村建設已獲得相當於「實騐室」中研討</p>
<p>之結果，而並非空洞之理論。理應集中力量</p>
<p>努力推行，似無再言「實騐」之必要。</p>
<p>二，再根據（甲）項而言，實騐工作應</p>
<p>行之於「實騐室」，所以防實外之失敗，而</p>
<p>使全廠蒙重大之損害。姑假定計劃大綱所載</p>
<p>之具體施東盡展理論，似亦不宜以縣為實齡</p>
<p>之工具，而使之冒成敗鈍利之危險。但另組</p>
<p>織縣之雛形作為「鄕村建設之實驗室」，又</p>
<p>非事實所許，故率直言之竟無「實騐」之可</p>
<p>能。</p>
<p>三，根據（乙項）而言，再按鄕村建設</p>
<p>計劃大綱　第二之內容，綜括之約可分為三</p>
<p>要目：（于）訓練靑年提高其精神上體格上</p>
<p>以及技術上之修養，是為教；（丑）改革稅</p>
<p>制，增進生產，使鄉民不受剝削而生活豐裕</p>
<p>，是為養；（實）組織護鄕模範隊，使其本</p>
<p>身能負起治安之責任，是為衛。教養衛三者</p>
<p>合為一體，以之治國國必强，以之治省省必</p>
<p>與，以之建設鄉村鄉村焉有不蓬勃繁榮之理</p>
<p>，此匪特非新穎之方法，且幾成為老生常談</p>
<p>，至少可認為政治上初步之常議。其尚待「</p>
<p>實騐」何？</p>
<p>四，再根據（乙）項而言，實駿工作須</p>
<p>以外界條件為前提，然後方能以所得之經騐</p>
<p>推行於同樣外界條件之共他方面。今計劃大</p>
<p>綱中所規定「實馳縣」選定之標準雖僅寥寨</p>
<p>五點，然確乎能合此標準之縣治百不得一，</p>
<p>縱使能於三省一市之中選出四縣以供「實齡</p>
<p>」，則所得之經駝必過於樂觀，而難於推行</p>
<p>至等而下之之各縣。且各地民情良窳之不同</p>
<p>，土地肥瘠之不等，種種天然之差別更無以</p>
<p>强同，勢必逐一加以「實齡了」。</p>
<p>綜上以觀，縣名「實騐」，無此需要，</p>
<p>無此可能，且「實騐」果有結果，仍未足以</p>
<p>推廣應用。然則如之何而可？曰實施全面鄕</p>
<p>村建設，而其步驟如下：（子）確定鄕村建</p>
<p>設之原則與目標；（丑）確定超度高度及初</p>
<p>步鄉村建設之細目及進度表；（寅）將三省</p>
<p>一市所有各縣按其天然的及人為的實况分為</p>
<p>超級高級初級三等，（一切建設條件具備者</p>
<p>，列為超級縣，積極施以超度純粹建設工作</p>
<p>，其次列為高級縣，一面排除迎設上之障碍</p>
<p>，同時施以高度之雜設工作，再共次列為初</p>
<p>級縣，用全力掃蕩一切組力，而作初步建設</p>
<p>之準備。）同時並進，隨時檢討糾正，以冀</p>
<p>逐步收效按期完成。此外對於人事方面，尤</p>
<p>宜有瓣當之布置，更不能以現有縣長之品學</p>
<p>，為選定實騐縣之標準。應以長於政治軍事</p>
<p>者長初級縣，長於建設技術者長超級縣，兩</p>
<p>者兼長者長高級縣，不學無術貪汚腐敗者應</p>
<p>即分別撤職懲戒。使烏烟療氣一掃而空。</p>
<p>整理縣治建設鄕村，猶醫療疾病處方用</p>
<p>藥，察其病理投以藥石，萬不可以病人為試</p>
<p>騐品，更不可以甲病之經駝用之於乙病。病</p>
<p>情重者宜急治，體質虧者宜扶持，豈可以避</p>
<p>重就輕，忽視病人之生命而謂已盡鬱治之道</p>
<p>。醫人如此，醫國何獨不然！</p>

<h3>日防空綱　佈置周密　美機犧牲重大</h3>
<p>里斯木二十二日中</p>
<p>央社電　關於美空軍二十</p>
<p>日晚間空襲日本北九州及</p>
<p>中國地方西部事，美巒社</p>
<p>駐B29型機載地記者二十</p>
<p>一日晨間，曾通過美軍當</p>
<p>局之檢查，發出一消息，</p>
<p>陳述此次空襲，乃美軍第</p>

<p>而來，一一對我機後方之</p>
<p>轟炸機敢然據撞，轟然齊</p>
<p>毀，同時俱墜。日本迎擊</p>
<p>之機數多出意外，第二十</p>
<p>航空部隊是役犧牲甚大，</p>
<p>吾等乃知日本航空部隊如</p>
<p>何防衛本土矣。</p>

<p>該會提案內容與小林氏之</p>
<p>答覆如次：該會決議案內</p>
<p>容　前內閣為期人心一致</p>
<p>，使政府表裹一體，翼政</p>

<h3>諾曼第德軍　突破袋形包圍　爭奪土倫展開激戰</h3>
<p>柏林二十日中央社</p>
<p>電　德國社訊：諾曼第一</p>
<p>役中最重要之事件，為德</p>
<p>坦克軍與糜托化編隊，自</p>
<p>法萊斯·阿根坦區英美軍</p>
<p>之袋內，完成突破，己能</p>
<p>與在談區迤西之德軍部隊</p>
<p>保持接觸。經整日之激戰</p>
<p>後，美加軍隊被殲減，殘</p>
<p>部則亦均被擊退，但機軍</p>
<p>之損失亦重，德傘兵於此</p>
<p>役貢獻頗大。被包圍在阿</p>
<p>根坦與法萊斯之德軍大隊</p>
<p>，現已搬至塞納河西面，</p>
<p>且在該處參加熾烈之拉鋸</p>
<p>戰。向塞納河前進之美坦</p>
<p>克車與機械化部隊，在凡</p>
<p>爾農與曼特區作戰，企圖</p>
<p>在塞納河北岸建立橋頭堡</p>
<p>，但已被擊退，無法進入</p>
<p>凡爾農。美軍增調現正在</p>
<p>奧爾良與特魯間作戰之强</p>
<p>大摩托化編隊，以抵抗德</p>
<p>方援軍，故其自西南方進</p>
<p>抵巴黎之企圖再度被挫。</p>
<p>洛爾河前綫除斥　攻勢外</p>
<p>，美軍與德後防隊之間僅</p>
<p>有小接觸。美軍在布列塔</p>

<h3>中野氏談　振興輕工業</h3>
<p>北京二十二日中央</p>
<p>社電　北平日商工會議所</p>
<p>中野氏，對當地輕工業之</p>
<p>振興方策，及其可能性談</p>
<p>述如次。振興當地工業及</p>
<p>確保生活必需品，乃華北</p>
<p>之最重要者，不論自其側</p>
<p>面促進重要物資之供給，</p>
<p>及防止通貨膨脹，促進生</p>
<p>產品收買，由任何方面觀</p>
<p>之，亦鑿必要，華北輕工</p>
<p>業發展，越出於預想以上</p>
<p>，其資金方面亦隨重要產</p>
<p>業資金之需要增加，金融</p>
<p>難免相當窮乏，然華北民</p>
<p>間資本尙有餘裕，倘能導</p>
<p>入正軌，則亦可防止過去</p>
<p>之物資昂騰，實一舉兩得</p>
<p>之施策。</p>
<h3>德軍增援轉守為攻東綫戰局漸趨穩定</h3>
<p>柏林二十二日中央</p>
<p>社電　海通社訊：當茲東</p>
<p>綫大戰業已抵達最高峯，</p>
<p>而迅速接近最後決定階段</p>
<p>時。局勢已有重要變化。</p>
<p>此項變化發生於七月底與</p>
<p>八月初之問，當夏季戰事</p>
<p>初期，德軍地位甚為嚴重</p>
<p>，中路之沼浮地區無路可</p>
<p>通，德軍之聯絡各處都被</p>
<p>切斷，而薩軍機機化部織</p>
<p>則長驅西進。德國兵士在</p>
<p>困難時，常依績於統兵將</p>
<p>官之能力，淮至八月初旬</p>
<p>戰事開始進入新階段，德</p>
<p>軍組織成為有力之部隊，</p>
<p>集中力量改守為攻，在戰</p>
<p>綫較危急之區，從事大規</p>
<p>模之部署，且調到生力軍</p>
<p>增援，於是局勢遂告穩全</p>
<p>，使髒軍夏季攻勢計劃遂</p>
<p>告擱淺。</p>

<p>及軍崙補給問題，兩人最</p>
<p>近將由華盛頓出發，預定</p>
<p>於重慶逗翎數月間。又據</p>
<p>華盛頓政界方面消息，因</p>
<p>日軍之大陸作戰，重慶抗</p>

<h3>越督德古掌攬全權　對日協力益增强</h3>
<p>西冀廿二日中央社</p>
<p>電　法國政府聲明將一切</p>
<p>權限授予德古總督後，越</p>
<p>南當地各報一齊揭載政府</p>
<p>之鑿明，但未加解釋，</p>
<p>因此項措置乃意料中事。</p>
<p>緣德古總督從來即為越南</p>
<p>之政治最高主宰者，於該</p>
<p>地常　與元首相同　限，</p>
<p>由現下之法本關情形觀之</p>
<p>，此舉乃當然之歸趨，由</p>
<p>此亦可見漲國之外交，內</p>
<p>政等絕無任何變化，一般</p>
<p>法國民衆之反響，亦復如</p>
<p>斯。其對於日木之信賴，</p>
<p>更為堅固，一般與論皆訓</p>
<p>，越南總督指導之下，為</p>
<p>求平靜繁榮，而一致團</p>
<p>結之法國人民，今後更當</p>
<p>鞏固協力，為建設大東亞</p>
<p>及協助日本而壽鬥。此中</p>
<p>尤堪注目者，越南此後回</p>
<p>復其完全之東亞性格，在</p>
<p>日本保護下，為建設世界</p>
<p>和平而協力，法本國之此</p>
<p>種措置，由日本觀之，越</p>
<p>南對於日本之友好關係與</p>
<p>協力，根本無何變化，從</p>
<p>來務須在維希與災京間折</p>
<p>衝之問題，今後當可於現</p>
<p>地直接交涉，兩國劉之共</p>
<p>同防衛恊守及經濟協定，</p>
<p>將得早日迅速實施。對於</p>
<p>經濟協力中週週不通之諸</p>
<p>問題，由此次德古總督掌</p>
<p>攬全種後，劉於日本戰力</p>
<p>之增强貢獻上，更將增大</p>
<p>巴莫代表就任緬甸聯盟總裁</p>
<p>仰光二十二中央</p>
<p>社電　緬甸國家代表已莫</p>
<p>，二十日接見記者，正式</p>
<p>發表設置大緬甸聯盟，並</p>
<p>陳述就任首屆總裁後之抱</p>
<p>負，期各方予以恊力，其</p>
<p>大意謂：大緬甸聯盟之性</p>
<p>格，組織，目的及實踐方</p>
<p>法，可分下列數點說明：</p>
<p>性格</p>
<p>該聯盟與緬甸</p>
<p>之一切組織相</p>
<p>異，不含有政治性或黨派</p>
<p>性，乃緬甸國民之共同組</p>
<p>織，吾人不應由政治上，</p>
<p>社會上或宗教上之異點，</p>
<p>而觀察一國民之目的，要</p>
<p>之，此乃團結緬甸國民之</p>
<p>國民組織，故該聯盟於聯</p>
<p>合緬甸各民族之大前提下</p>
<p>而產生，因此為緬甸國民</p>
<p>歷史上劃一新階段。</p>
<p>組織</p>
<p>大緬甸聯盟係</p>
<p>活用現存之國</p>
<p>家服務國，民衆防衛組織</p>
<p>等團體，並加以修正，而</p>
<p>以全國國民為聯盟會員之</p>
<p>組識。其組織機構係以十</p>
<p>戶為最下部單位，此外，</p>
<p>更按都巿委員會及地方委</p>
<p>員會之次序，集合下部組</p>
<p>織於最高部，設全緬飼中</p>
<p>央事務局，由事務總長管</p>
<p>轄之。至總裁一職，由國</p>
<p>家代表担任，事務總長由</p>
<p>不管部大雜就任，以期政</p>
<p>府與國家間關係之緊密，</p>
<p>然此種政府與聯盟之一體</p>
<p>化，基於戰時之需要，乃</p>
<p>作一時之措置。職後之大</p>
<p>緬甸聯盟，仍恢復為純粹</p>
<p>之國民團體，關於聯盟組</p>
<p>織之指導者，即刻自曾從</p>
<p>事緬甸獨立之運動者國家</p>
<p>服務國指導者等團體內選</p>
<p>一萬人，實施三個月之訓</p>
<p>練，以充當指導者。</p>
<p>目的</p>
<p>大緬甸聯盟之</p>
<p>目的，乃為緬</p>
<p>甸之自由而戰，一般國民</p>
<p>堅持必勝信念，捨此不含</p>
<p>有任何之政治的，聯盟之</p>
<p>機龍集中於後方，活動方</p>
<p>面以國民防衛努力實現戰</p>
<p>爭及戰時則民福祉為主眼</p>
<p>，展開聯盟之一切活動，</p>
<p>然動員國民總力，昂掦國</p>
<p>民戰意，發揮最高能力之</p>
<p>點，乃為聯盟直接担當之</p>
<p>任務。</p>
<p>方針</p>
<p>實踐方針為實</p>
<p>施國民總動員</p>
<p>，先和用全國十戶制之組</p>
<p>織，實施國民登記制度，</p>
<p>發揮國民全力，使人盡其</p>
<p>用，以實現眞正之大衆防</p>
<p>衛及大衆實傳等。</p>
<p>緬新外長聲明外交政策不變</p>

<p>十一日發表聲明謂，緬甸</p>
<p>外交政策並無變化，更將</p>

<p>各國友好關係，其大意如</p>
<p>次：本人就任外長，首先</p>
<p>聲明緬甸外交方針並無變</p>
<p>化，更顯附言對過去之外</p>
<p>交方針，更將以熱憲遂行</p>
<p>之，增進緬甸與大東亞共</p>
<p>榮團各國之友好關係，以</p>

<h3>油糧會接辦　移動許可事宜　商統會將於日內移交</h3>
<p>商統會油糧統制委員會，此次奉令改組，決依據政府頒布統制法令</p>
<p>，實施管理油糧營運，增加生產，疏通來源，以期供求平衡，抑平市價</p>

<p>旨在統一管理油糧自由營運。關於油糧移動事宜，前原由商統會物資移</p>
<p>動許可事務所辦理，現擬將移動許可事務，統歸由油糧統制委員會辦理</p>

<p>：上海慈善獎券舉辦方案</p>
<p>，　上海公益慈善界呈經</p>
<p>財政部核准，社會福利部</p>
<p>上海市政府備案，特發行</p>
<p>上海慈善獎券（以下簡稱</p>
<p>本獎券）。　本獎券以籌</p>
<p>募公益慈善經費，補助公</p>

<p>獎券由上海公益慈善界及</p>

<p>織委員會負責辦理。　本</p>
<p>委員會設主任委員一人，</p>

<h3>稅務署　稅收激增</h3>
<p>財政都說務署近年來</p>
<p>對於統稅特稅，積極調整</p>
<p>，以致稅收激增兩倍以上</p>
<p>，尤其本年舉辦戰時消費</p>
<p>特稅，稅款增加更鉅。據</p>
<p>悉該署全部說收之中，以</p>
<p>消費特稅佔百分之六十以</p>
<p>上，統稅稅收，因政府實</p>
<p>施物資統制政策後，工廠</p>
<p>出產之物品移動稍受限制</p>
<p>，而目前電力之限制，工</p>
<p>業生產量不無減少，故而</p>
<p>稅收未見起色，惟當局緝</p>
<p>私工作嚴密，漏稅情事，</p>
<p>亦漸絕跡，是以整個稅政</p>
<p>，可望日趨正軌。</p>

<p>七日</p>
<p>發表了一封「一個洛選學</p>
<p>生的來信」，引起社會各</p>
<p>方的同情，可見「助學最</p>
<p>善，為善最樂」，已成為</p>
<p>一般的心理。運日承海棠</p>

<p>讀者，張景呂·鄭毓芳·</p>
<p>潘爵銘·朱聯保·一讀者</p>
<p>，延齡。諸君紛紛捐款，</p>
<p>指定捐給這位苦學生領取</p>
<p>，這位苦學生（本人不願</p>
<p>發表姓名），是南通路聖</p>
<p>德中小學初中二年級學生</p>
<p>，昨天到館，作了一席談</p>
<p>話，看他眉淸目秀，頗有</p>
<p>英銳之氣，確是後生可畏</p>
<p>的少年。他知道幾位熟心</p>
<p>人土捐款助學，表示非常</p>
<p>感激！除收領葉竹靑君所</p>
<p>捐學雜書籍各費五千三百</p>
<p>元外，其餘各位的捐欵，</p>
<p>他請求作為一般的助學金</p>
<p>，當時他又寫了一封感謝</p>
<p>信，請予發表，函云：</p>
<p>「自從貴報發表了我</p>
<p>前次懇求援助的信後，承</p>
<p>蒙好幾位慈善家肯幫助我</p>
<p>現在，我下學期可以沒有</p>
<p>問題的繼續上學了。對於</p>
<p>諸公援助我的美意。眞是</p>
<p>說不出的感謝，而且永遠</p>
<p>不會忘記惠恩的。但我同</p>
<p>時想起：像我這樣困難的</p>
<p>苦學生，何止萬千，我是</p>
<p>繳倖能够繼續讀書了，和</p>
<p>我境遇相似而還沒有得到</p>
<p>助學金的學生，當然很多</p>
<p>很多，因此，我希望再有</p>
<p>千百個像援助我的這幾位</p>
<p>先生一樣的仁人，康慨地</p>
<p>多多地捐助，使和一樣迫</p>
<p>切地需要幫助而還不能領</p>
<p>受助學金的淸寒學生，也</p>
<p>能不失所望，繼續求學，</p>
<p>那麽，他們的心裏，一定</p>
<p>也會和我的心裏一樣，非</p>
<p>常的感激呢。至於其他諸</p>
<p>位專定捐給我的助金，不</p>
<p>敢多受，請分配給一般的</p>
<p>苦學生，俗語說：「有飯</p>
<p>大家吃」，我得加上一句</p>
<p>：「有書大家讀」不知先</p>
<p>生以為如何？「助學最善</p>
<p>，為善最樂」，敬祝為善</p>

<h3>Experiment County</h3>
<p>The two characters "Experiment" (實騐) are originally a scientific term.</p>
<p>Its meaning has two aspects: (A) For those with a theory but lacking concrete implementation measures, a small-scale experiment must first be conducted, and then expanded to a large scale for common use. For example, for all substitutes of natural products, whether artificial butter or artificial rubber, their chemical theories must first be determined, and then studied by the "Experiment Room" to determine the methods of implementation, so that they are suitable for large-scale factory production without suffering losses or failure. (B) For novel methods without a sure grasp of effectiveness, a small-scale experiment must first be conducted under certain external conditions to determine whether it is worthwhile to promote it universally under the same external conditions based on the merits of its results. For example, for a novel method of railway construction, an "Experiment Section" must first be designated to test its adoption under a certain type of locomotive at a certain speed. If the experience gained truly matches the expected effect, then all lines traveled by the same type of locomotive at the same speed can be rebuilt, thereby improving the general function of transportation.</p>
<p>Recently, the National Defense Council has attached importance to rural construction and designated the name "Experiment County," and further stipulated the standards for its election. This is enough to show that the authorities are handling national affairs with a scientific mindset, which is indeed beyond reproach. However, according to the above two meanings of "Experiment," analyzing the "Experiment County" in rural construction seems to have some imperfections. Therefore, I hereby offer my opinions for the reference of relevant parties.</p>
<p>1. Based on item (A), according to the "Outline of Rural Construction Plan," the second item already indicates concrete implementation measures. This means that rural construction has already obtained results equivalent to those studied in the "Experiment Room," and it is not just an empty theory. Efforts should be concentrated to vigorously promote it, and there seems to be no need to mention "Experiment" again.</p>
<p>2. Also based on item (A), the experimental work should be carried out in the "Experiment Room" to prevent external failures and prevent the entire factory from suffering significant damage. Suppose that the concrete implementation mentioned in the "Outline of Rural Construction Plan" fully demonstrates the theory, it is still not appropriate to use the county as a tool for experimentation, and make it risk the danger of success or failure. However, forming a prototype of a county as a "Rural Construction Laboratory" is not permitted by reality. Therefore, to put it bluntly, there is no possibility of "Experiment."</p>
<p>3. Based on item (B), according to the content of the "Outline of Rural Construction Plan," the second item, it can be roughly divided into three main objectives: (A) Training young people to improve their spiritual, physical, and technical qualities is education. (B) Reforming the tax system, increasing production, and making the villagers free from exploitation and living a prosperous life is sustenance. (C) Organizing a model homeland defense team so that they can take responsibility for public security themselves is defense. Education, sustenance, and defense combined as one. Using them to govern the country will make the country strong. Using them to govern the province will make the province prosperous. Using them to build the countryside, how can the countryside not flourish and prosper? This is not only not a novel method, but it has almost become an old saying, or at least it can be considered a preliminary common topic in politics. What still needs to be "Experimented" on?</p>
<p>4. Also based on item (B), the experimental work must be based on external conditions, and then the experience gained can be promoted to other aspects under the same external conditions. Although the "Experiment County" selection criteria stipulated in the "Outline of Rural Construction Plan" are only five points, it is certain that few counties can meet these criteria. Even if four counties can be selected from three provinces and one city for "Experimentation," the experience gained will inevitably be overly optimistic and difficult to promote to counties of a lower level. Moreover, the differences in local customs, the inequality of land fertility, and various natural differences cannot be forced to be the same, and it is inevitable that "Experimentation" will have to be carried out one by one.</p>
<p>In summary, the name "Experiment County" is unnecessary, impossible, and even if the "Experiment" has results, it is still not enough to promote its application. So what can be done? It is to implement comprehensive rural construction, and the steps are as follows: (A) Determine the principles and goals of rural construction. (B) Determine the details and schedules of advanced and preliminary rural construction. (C) Divide all counties in the three provinces and one city into three levels, super, advanced, and preliminary, according to their natural and man-made conditions. (Those with all the necessary construction conditions are classified as super counties, and actively implement advanced construction work. The next level is advanced counties, which eliminate obstacles to construction on the one hand, and implement advanced construction work at the same time. The next level is preliminary counties, which use all their strength to sweep away all resistance and prepare for preliminary construction.) Proceed simultaneously, review and correct at any time, in order to gradually achieve results and complete them on schedule. In addition, there should be proper arrangements for personnel, and the existing magistrate's character and learning should not be used as the standard for selecting an experiment county. Those who are good at politics and military affairs should be in charge of preliminary counties, those who are good at construction technology should be in charge of super counties, and those who are good at both should be in charge of advanced counties. Those who are uneducated, incompetent, corrupt, and degenerate should be dismissed and punished separately to eliminate all darkness.</p>
<p>Organizing county administration and building the countryside is like prescribing medicine to treat diseases. Observe the pathology and administer medicine accordingly. One should never use the patient as an experimental product, let alone use the experience of treating disease A to treat disease B. Those with serious illnesses should be treated urgently, and those with weak constitutions should be supported. How can one avoid the serious and focus on the easy, ignoring the patient's life and claiming to have done everything possible to treat the disease? This is how to treat people, and how can treating the country be any different!</p>
<h3>Wu Song to Dinghai Sea Area Our Fleet Exercise Completed Navy Minister Ren Talks About Significant Progress</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency) – The increasingly serious Pacific war situation at the present stage has been unanimously recognized by the people of the country. There is no doubt that the active development of the Great East Asian War will be carried out in the future. The Chinese Navy has a responsibility to have a strong voice based on the responsibility of the Great East Asian War. The Ministry of the Navy, with this in mind, gathered warships such as Hai Xing, Hai Xiang, Hai Sui, and Hai 于 from August 1st to form a fleet, and carried out combat technical training exercises in the Wu Song to Dinghai Sea area. The results have been very good in recent days, and the allied naval officers have expressed their appreciation. It is learned that our Navy Minister Ren Yuandao, accompanied by Allied Navy Lieutenant General Maeda yesterday, inspected the live ammunition shooting of the four warships. The Chief of Staff of the Port Headquarters, Major General Cao Nantian, served as the temporary team commander. According to Navy Minister Ren's remarks to reporters, the results of this fleet professional exercise have made significant progress compared to the past, and unlimited expectations can be placed on the future advancement of our country's navy. In addition, Navy Minister Ren, after inspecting the live ammunition exercise, visited the sea areas of Bianlinsha and Putuoshan with his entourage, and was very satisfied with the efforts of the navy in these areas. Ren's official inspection has been completed, and he returned to Nanjing on the 22nd. At the same time, the four warships participating in the exercise returned to their original defenses on the same day.</p>
<h3>Japanese Local Governor Conference Held in Tokyo Today Government Clearly States Determination and Policy Direction</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – The Japanese government will hold a local governor conference at the Prime Minister's official residence on the 23rd to clearly state the government's determination and policy direction, in order to thoroughly inspire local frontline administration. The focus of this conference is to discuss key proposals to accelerate the enhancement of combat power against the background of the current stage of the war, especially awaiting the upsurge of local governors across the country. Therefore, the conference schedule is extremely tight, and all important matters will be decided in just one day on the 23rd. At that time, the governors of one capital, two prefectures, two offices, and forty-three prefectures, including Governor Nishio of Tokyo, Governor Saka of Hokkaido, and Governor Osawa of Guntai, as well as Prime Minister Koiso and all cabinet ministers and the three chief cabinet secretaries on the government side, will attend.</p>
<p>Conference Procedure</p>
<p>The conference procedure is scheduled as follows:</p>
<p>First, Prime Minister Koiso will report on the government's determination under this major professional situation and the efforts expected from the local governors, and will give instructions to the governors separately. Next, the Foreign Minister and Greater East Asia Minister, Army Minister Sugiyama, and Navy Minister Yonai will speak in turn. After that, at 9:30, they will jointly pay a visit to the Imperial Palace. At 10:30, they will return to the Prime Minister's official residence to continue the conference. The Minister of Agriculture and Commerce Shimada, the Minister of Munitions Fujiwara, the Minister of Health and Welfare Hirose, the Minister of Transport and Communications Maeda, and the Minister of Finance Ishiwatari will explain the policies to enhance combat power and exchange opinions with each other, focusing on this. There will be a break at noon, and the discussion will continue from 1:00 PM to the evening. At 5:00 PM, the governors will participate in the National Branch Chiefs Conference hosted by the Kizan Society branch chief. After speeches by President Kobayashi and Vice President Chu Fang, a confidential discussion will be held. At 6:00 PM, they will go to the Minister of Interior's official residence to attend a dinner party hosted by the Minister of Interior to discuss the policy of internal affairs authorities and a unified local administrative operation. At the same time, the government will take this opportunity to hold a local administrative coordination meeting at the Prime Minister's official residence on the 24th to conduct careful discussions on the administrative measures to rapidly enhance combat power.</p>
<h3>Japanese Air Defense System Well-Organized Heavy Sacrifices for American Planes</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Regarding the American Air Force's air raid on Kitakyushu and western Chugoku on the evening of the 20th, an American journalist stationed at a B-29 base, on the morning of the 21st, after passing the inspection of the American military authorities, issued a message stating that the air raid was conducted by the 20th Air Force of the American military on the largest possible scale at present, and admitted that the bomber squadron suffered great damage. The general idea is that the 20th Air Force launched a major attack on the Japanese mainland on the 20th, which the Asian Air Force had once performed, using all its strength in day and night attacks. This was the fourth time since the air unit began attacking the Japanese mainland. The 20th Air Force's first daytime air raid, aimed at challenging the Japanese air force's reserve forces for defending the homeland, was actually the Yahata spirit factory area. The B-29 aircraft bombed with all their might according to this purpose. On the afternoon of the 20th, the B-29 aircraft attacking team flew to the sky over Kyushu and suddenly entered an extremely fierce anti-aircraft barrage. Suddenly, the Japanese fighter squadron came from a very high distance, diagonally piercing through the black cloud-like barrage, and each dared to hit the bomber behind our plane, collapsing and destroying them all at the same time. The number of Japanese interceptors was unexpectedly large. The 20th Air Force made great sacrifices in this battle. We now know how the Japanese Air Force defends its homeland.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army in Henan Establishes Traffic Monitoring Stations</h3>
<p>Zhengzhou, 22nd (Central News Agency) – The Japanese military authorities, in view of the special political and economic situation in the newly occupied areas of Henan, have severely cracked down on the exchange of materials and the entry and exit of people between North China and Central China. This time, in order to further thoroughly crack down, they announced on the 21st that they would temporarily establish six traffic monitoring stations for the exchange of materials. Regarding the entry and exit of people, a permit system is also adopted at the monitoring stations.</p>
<h3>Japanese Wing Political Association to Refresh Personnel Temporary Suspension of Organization and General Affairs Committee</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Since Mr. Kobayashi took office as the president of the Japanese Wing Political Association, he has repeatedly studied various situations and personnel organizations within the association, and a plan can be decided before the extraordinary Diet session. At the Standing General Affairs Committee meeting at noon on the 21st, President Kobayashi explained his belief in changing personnel organizations as follows: The selection of new personnel will be made after listening to opinions from all parties, and there is already a plan in mind, which can be announced on the 22nd. The organization and the General Affairs Committee will not be changed for the time being. It is planned to select a small number of consultative personnel as the central mechanism for advancing the meeting. The liaison plan with the government is entrusted to the former Minister of Transport and Communications Maeda. The term of office for staff is one year, and elections will be held in mid-April after each regular Diet session. From next year, appointments will be made in mid-April. From next year, half or one-third of the general affairs staff will be replaced. This method can ensure consistency within the association.</p>
<p>Two Proposals Submitted by Diet Members</p>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Diet Members' Comrades Association held a general meeting on the afternoon of the 21st. After exchanging opinions on the current situation and the extraordinary Diet, it made a resolution and met with President Kobayashi at the Wing Political Headquarters at 5 o'clock, submitting the resolution and requesting a method of implementation. President Kobayashi also responded to this. The contents of the association's proposal and Mr. Kobayashi's reply are recorded as follows: The contents of the association's resolution: In order to unify the hearts of the people and make the government consistent, the old cadres of the Wing Political Association should bear clear responsibility. Based on the above principles, the old cadres should be decisively swept away when the new cadres are elected. Regarding the operation of the Diet, the previous attitude often improperly trampled on the power of deliberation. In the future, the operation of the Diet will clearly correct the above errors. Mr. Kobayashi replied: It is still difficult to comprehensively refresh the cadres, and we will wait until the expiration of the term to gradually plan for it. Regarding the operation of the Diet, I have the same feeling in terms of intent.</p>
<h3>Japanese House of Representatives Holds Diet Consultative Council</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – The Japanese government and Diet, in view of the upcoming 85th extraordinary session, are currently urgently seeking all-out preparations. Prime Minister Koiso has already met with President Kobayashi of the Wing Political Association, and at 2:00 PM on the 21st, he met with Chief Cabinet Secretary Tanaka, Director-General of the Legislative Bureau Miura, and Secretaries-General of the House of Peers Kobayashi and the House of Representatives Oki at the Prime Minister's official residence to hold extremely important consultations. The House of Representatives decided to hold a "Diet Consultative Council" at 10:00 AM on the 23rd to discuss the policy for the extraordinary session.</p>
<h3>Anti-Bandit Operations in North China Half-Year War Results</h3>
<p>Beijing, 22nd (Central News Agency) – The North China Pacification Army, under the goal of anti-banditry and national construction, has exerted its full strength to cooperate with the Japanese army and continue to eliminate communist bandits.

<h3>Japanese Minister Horinouchi Gives a Speech at a Life Camp</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Japanese Minister Horinouchi, on the afternoon of the 22nd, at the invitation of the New National Movement Youth Summer Labor Life Camp, came to the camp to give a special speech. The topic of the speech was "The Great East Asia War and Chinese Youth," and he pointed out in detail the causes of the Great East Asia War and its relationship with Chinese youth. After an hour, all the students listened and expressed their joy and excitement.</p>
<h3>German Troops Break Through Normandy Pocket Fierce Battle Unfolds for Toulon</h3>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency: The most important event in the Normandy campaign was the completion of the breakthrough by German tank forces and the Meitok Brigade from the British and American forces in the Falaise-Argentan area. They have been able to maintain contact with the German forces west of the Tar area. After a day of fierce fighting, the US and Canadian troops were annihilated, and the remnants were also repelled. However, the losses of the air force were also heavy. The German paratroopers made great contributions to this battle. The German troops besieged in Argentan and Falaise have now moved to the west side of the Seine River and are participating in fierce tug-of-war battles there. The American tank and mechanized units advancing towards the Seine River are fighting in the Vernon and Mantes areas, attempting to establish a bridgehead on the north bank of the Seine, but have been repelled and unable to enter Vernon. The US military has increased the deployment of strong motorized brigades that are currently fighting between Orleans and Tours to resist German reinforcements. Therefore, their attempt to reach Paris from the southwest was once again frustrated. On the Loire River front, there was only minor contact between the US military and the German rear guard team, except for artillery offensives. The US military shelled Lorient in Brittany.</p>
<p>Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency) – German News Agency Frontline News: Reconnaissance troops of the Anti-Axis forces have approached the outskirts of Paris. Because the situation is uncertain, the future is difficult to predict.</p>
<p>Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency) – German News Agency News, according to German official announcement: Between the southern coast of France and the Durance River, German troops are disengaging from the enemy to the west. The enemy's pursuit is unrelenting. A fierce offensive and defensive battle is unfolding in Toulon. The enemy attacked in Aix (north of Marseille), and the German counterattack drove the enemy back.</p>
<p>Fleet Bombards Southern French Fortress</p>
<p>Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency) – According to frontline news: The Anti-Axis fleet began shelling La Ciotat, a port between Toulon and Marseille, on the evening of the 20th. It is generally believed that this was because the Anti-Axis troops suffered setbacks in Hyeres, so they attempted to carry out another landing in La Ciotat to complete the encirclement of the port of Toulon.</p>
<h3>Key French Government Figures Gather in Belfort</h3>
<p>Zurich, 22nd (Central News Agency) – According to the Doramen Social Democratic newspaper, French Prime Minister Laval and key government figures arrived in Belfort (Belfort, on the northwestern border of Switzerland) on the afternoon of the 19th. Part of them had already arrived in Mulhouse (in Alsace). Chairman Petain also planned to arrive in Belfort on the evening of the 19th.</p>
<h3>Mr. Nakano Discusses Promoting Light Industry</h3>
<p>Beijing, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Mr. Nakano of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Beijing discussed the policies and possibilities for promoting local light industry as follows: Promoting local industry and ensuring daily necessities are the most important things in North China. Whether it is promoting the supply of important materials from its side, preventing inflation, or promoting the purchase of production products, it is necessary from any aspect. The development of light industry in North China has exceeded expectations. The financial aspect has also become quite poor with the increasing demand for funds for important industries. However, private capital in North China still has a surplus. If it can be brought into the right track, it can also prevent the past rise in material prices. It is a policy that achieves two goals with one action.</p>
<h3>German Reinforcements Shift from Defense to Offense The Eastern Front Situation Gradually Stabilizes</h3>
<p>Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Haisong News Agency: When the Great Eastern War has reached its peak and is rapidly approaching the final decision stage, there has been an important change in the situation. This change occurred between the end of July and the beginning of August. At the beginning of the summer war, the German position was very serious. There was no way through the marshy area in the center, and the German lines of communication were cut off everywhere. The Soviet mechanized units drove west. In times of difficulty, German soldiers often relied on the ability of their commanders. The battle began to enter a new stage in early August. The German army organized into a powerful force, concentrated its forces to change from defense to offense, engaged in large-scale deployments in areas where the battle lines were more critical, and transferred fresh troops to reinforce them. As a result, the situation became stable, and the Soviet summer offensive plan was shelved.</p>
<h3>Indian Gathering Makes Every Effort to Fight for Liberation</h3>
<p>A Certain Base in Burma, 22nd (Central News Agency) – The Sixth Anniversary of the Establishment of the Indian Provisional Government was held solemnly in Chhatgaon, Burma, on the 21st. At the meeting, Mr. Bawi strongly stated that the people of East India should gather all their manpower and material resources today to reserve combat power for the next war, and strive for the uprising and unity of the people. The meeting also passed a resolution based on the general will of the Indians present, resolving to work with Japan and other allied countries to grasp all circumstances, and even if they encounter difficulties and hardships, they must persist to the end until they achieve common victory, liberate India from foreign oppression, and achieve liberation.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Sends Representatives to Chongqing</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency) – According to a Washington dispatch: Roosevelt announced on the night of the 19th that War Production Board Director Nelson and Army Major General Harry will go to Chongqing as representatives of the German system. Among them, Major General Harry is in Chongqing to coordinate military vehicle and military logistics supply issues. The two will depart from Washington soon and are scheduled to stay in Chongqing for several months. According to news from political circles in Washington, the Anti-Japanese War capability of Chongqing has been on the verge of collapse due to the Japanese army's continental operations. The United States has considered this result and decided to take this action.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Continues to Fight in Tinian Heavy Losses for the Enemy in New Guinea</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – An electric dispatch from a Japanese army base in the Central Pacific stated that after the Japanese army in Tinian severely damaged the US army, they are still utilizing the terrain in various places to continue fierce fighting. On the night of the 20th, several US planes bombed the southern area of the island and shelled the sea on the same night, which was extremely fierce. Hundreds of illuminating bombs were mixed and intertwined. The Japanese army is currently engaging in strong night raids to continue the fight.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from San Francisco, the Southwest Pacific Anti-Axis military authorities announced on the 15th that the Anti-Axis forces near Aitape in New Guinea have lost 1,307 people.</p>
<h3>Vietnam Governor-General Decoux Assumes Full Power; Cooperation with Japan Further Strengthened</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Xiji, 22nd</p>
<p>Telegram: After the French government declared that all authority would be granted to Governor-General Decoux, all newspapers in Vietnam published the government's clarification simultaneously, without further explanation. This measure was expected.</p>
<p>From the beginning, Governor-General Decoux has been the supreme political ruler of Vietnam, often enjoying authority equivalent to that of the head of state. Judging from the current situation of the French mainland, this move is a natural progression. This also shows that there will be no changes in the diplomacy or internal affairs of France. The reaction of the general French public is also the same. Their trust in Japan is even more solid. General opinion instructs that the French people, united under the guidance of the Governor-General of Vietnam for peace and prosperity, should further consolidate cooperation and devote themselves to building the Greater East Asia and assisting Japan. What is particularly noteworthy is that Vietnam will henceforth restore its full East Asian character and cooperate under Japanese protection to build world peace. From Japan's perspective, this measure taken by France has not changed the friendly relations and cooperation between Vietnam and Japan. The problem of having to mediate between Vichy and Nanjing in the past can now be directly negotiated on the spot. The joint defense treaty and economic agreement between the two countries will be implemented quickly. Regarding the various unresolved issues in economic cooperation, after Governor-General Decoux assumes full power, the contribution to the enhancement of Japan's war power will be even greater.</p>
<p>Bhamo Appointed President of the Union of Burma</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Yangon, 22nd</p>
<p>Telegram: Bhamo, the representative of the State of Burma, met with reporters on the 20th and formally announced the establishment of the Greater Burma Union, outlining his ambitions after taking office as the first president. He hopes for cooperation from all parties. The main idea is as follows: The nature, organization, purpose, and practical methods of the Greater Burma Union can be explained in the following points:</p>
<p>Nature</p>
<p>The League differs from all organizations in Burma</p>
<p>and does not contain political or partisan nature.</p>
<p>It is a joint organization of the Burmese people. We should not observe the purpose of a nation from political, social, or religious differences. In short, this is a national organization to unite the Burmese people. Therefore, the League is produced under the great premise of uniting all ethnic groups in Burma, thus marking a new stage in the history of the Burmese people.</p>
<p>Organization</p>
<p>The Great Burmese Alliance is</p>
<p>to use existing national</p>
<p>service organizations, people's defense organizations</p>
<p>and other groups, amend them, and</p>
<p>take the whole nation as members of the alliance.</p>
<p>organization. Its organizational structure is based on ten</p>
<p>households as the lowest unit. In addition,</p>
<p>In the order of the City Council and the Local Committee, the lower organizations are assembled at the highest level, and the Central Office of the whole Burmese is set up, and the Director-General of Affairs is in charge. The post of President is held by the National Representative, and the Director-General of Affairs is held by</p>
<p>Irrespective of the Ministry, so as to strengthen the relationship between the government and the country,</p>
<p>However, this integration of the government and the alliance is based on the needs of wartime, and it is</p>
<p>temporary measure. After his tenure, the Great</p>
<p>The Burmese League will return to pure</p>
<p>National Groups. On the leaders of the League Organization, it is decided to select</p>
<p>10,000 people from organizations such as the National Service Corps leaders who have been engaged in the Burmese independence movement to carry out three-month training</p>
<p>practice to act as instructors.</p>
<p>Purpose</p>
<p>The Great Burmese Alliance</p>
<p>The purpose is to</p>
<p>Fight for Burmese freedom, the general public</p>
<p>Persist in the belief of victory, and this does not include</p>
<p>Anything political, the League</p>
<p>The machine concentrates on the rear, the activity</p>
<p>In terms of national defense, we strive to realize war</p>
<p>and the people's well-being in wartime as the main concern</p>
<p>, develop all activities of the alliance,</p>
<p>However, mobilizing the overall national strength and raising the country</p>
<p>The point of people's will to fight and exerting the highest ability</p>
<p>, is the task directly undertaken by the alliance</p>
<p>Task.</p>
<p>Policy</p>
<p>The practical policy is to</p>
<p>Implement national mobilization</p>
<p>First, we will use the national ten-household system to</p>
<p>organization, implement national registration system,</p>
<p>to give full play to the national power, to make the best use of people,</p>
<p>To realize genuine mass defense</p>
<p>and mass practice.</p>
<p>Burmese Foreign Minister Declares No Change in Foreign Policy</p>

<h3>Oil and Grain Association to Take Over Mobile Permit Matters; Business Coordination Association to Transfer Within Days</h3>
<p>The Oil and Grain Control Committee of the Business Coordination Association was ordered to reorganize this time. It decided to implement the management of oil and grain operations in accordance with the control laws and regulations promulgated by the government, increase production, and dredge sources in order to balance supply and demand and suppress market prices, especially to strictly prevent private trading among the industry.

Now it is planned to transfer the transportation permit affairs to the Oil and Grain Control Committee for handling. It is heard that the Business Coordination Association will transfer it to the Oil and Grain Control Association within days.</p>
