<p>社評</p>
<h3>實業家的覺悟</h3>
<p>最近半年來股票市塲的衰落，充分表現出過去上海實業界經營方針的錯誤。用投機，取巧，操縱等等手段，謀一個人的暴利，歸根結底，害了大衆，害了國家，使國民資本不能夠築中成為國家資本，使中國實業的進行又倒退了數百步，使上海僅有的一些些實業基礎，無形中叉摧殘了大半。這些，都值得現在一般實業家的反省。</p>
<p>吉田東祐先生說過：「假如一九四四年是股票投機年，是「實業公司」時代，那末，一九四四年正如肺病的第三期，必須下決心治療，否則病家決不可救藥了」。半年來的經過，病象完全暴露，已經用不到檢查和診斷了，目前的問題就在趕快治療，而實業界本身必須覺悟，這是病態，立即澈底的改變方針，然後方能挽救。</p>
<p>實業界第一應當覺悟，此後必須從正當的腳踏實地的農工業人手。凡是沒有農工業做基礎的企業，不是眞正的實業。離開了農工業，或是掛了農工業的牌子而做股票的買賣，是虛業，不是實業。就拿商業原則來說，亦不能說是正當商業。這種不正當的商業，對於農工業非惟無益，反而有害，對於國民生計，更使不安定的因素增加，而有害民生。國家左戰爭時期，國民生活左忍受痛苦時期，農工業在力圖增產時期，斷不能容這種搗亂，取巧，害國害民的行為存在。政府雖不測立刻制裁，民意決不容忍，而民意的向背，更足以決定某一個人，某一個機關在社會上有否存在的價值。「十目所視，十手所指」，雖是無形的力量，卻有最大的權威，希望大家要注意。</p>
<p>實業家第二應當覺悟，此後只圖一己私利的事是不能再做了。一切的實業都需要社會的扶助，實業的資本需要社會大衆的投資，實業的出品需要社會大衆的購用。大實業一家先耍樹立社會上的信用，他要使投資的人獲得投資的利益，要使購用的人有使用上的便利，這樣，他的實業才能擴充，才能進步。只有從大衆的利益裹，然後可以獲得個人的利益，亦惟有在社會大衆都有利益的時候，個人的利益然後有保障，然後能享受。大衆需要的實業，大衆擁護的實業是永久的實業。只替私大造成發財機會的實業，雖然可以欺騙於一時，決不能維持於，永久。</p>
<p>實業家第三應當覺悟，現在正是替國家樹立復興基礎的機會，戰爭是破壞，同時也是建設。在這個戰爭時期，看看其他國家，新發明有多少，新建設有多少，再看看我們中國，新的可說一件都沒有，可是現在卻運最小的一點舊基礎也將摧殘殆盡了。以上海而認，以往苦心孤詣所經營的，不毀於戰爭而毀於投機，主持的人，淸夜捫心，這個良心上的責備是罪不容恕的。息樣利用這點基礎，在戰時求進步和革新，在戰後求復興和擴充，這種對自己對國家都有利的事情，是值得一般的深思考慮的。</p>
<p>諸位實業家們，這幾年來，諸位本身和諸位所主持的事業，物質上的損益怎樣？名譽上的損益怎樣？這本損益計算表，不必我們來做，諸位都是清清楚楚明明白白的了。此後應當走那一條路，諸位當然都應當自己決定。社會上的大衆正張着眼看諸位的轉變，要做大衆的擁護者，或是做大衆的反對者，都在於諸　將來成續的表現。</p>

<p>東京二十一日中央社電日翼政會前日總務部長於東條內閣總辭職後，二十日下午特發表談話，謂一億國民之戰意，決不因內閣更迭而有任何動搖，使一億國民及大東亞各地人士之人心為之一新，成立強而有力之戰時內閣，向完遂戰爭之途邁進一。氏並力謂後繼內閣當勇猛決斷，集中國民總力，將付當前之非常決戰局面</p>

<p>里斯本二十一日中央社電　據華盛頓電，美政界對於日東條內閣總辭職，似極重視，國務卿赫爾，陸次巴德森，於二十日會見記者時，會提及此事，如前任駐日大使現任國務院東亞局長格魯，亦特發表聲明，彼等認日本之戰時體制，由於更迭內開，必將愈形強化。並驚吿美國國民，於對日作戰前途，不得抱樂觀論，例如國務卿赫爾曾稱：日本更迭內閣後，吾等必須充分覺悟，日本已重新樹立改善之作戰計劃，陸次巴德森亦謂：日本內閣之更迭，對於陸海軍要衡，將必任命最剛強且最勇敢之司令官，茲錄格　聲明大意如次。日內閣雖已更迭，然日本戰鬥到底之戰爭方針，並無變化，日本民族不懼生死之傳統精神，已根深蒂固，美國民由於日內閣之更迭，即對前途感覺樂觀，或作希望觀測，實為危險。</p>

<p>柏林二十一日中央社電海通社訊：據有資格方面今晨稱，謀刺德元首之各王謀者皆已自殺或被槍決，放置炸彈之史都芬堡上校亦已被處決，其他與此事有牽涉之人，將被控同謀罪。據云他處並無意外事件發生，此次陰謀已完全失敗。</p>
<p>陰謀主動者與軍隊無關</p>
<p>柏林二十一日中央社電　德元首希特勒今日淸農向全國廣播，聲明　昨日雖曾遇刺，但未受傷，仍甚安好。渠言炸彈係史都芬堡上校所置，在距離數公尺處爆發，渠之最親信幕僚多人受傷，其中一人殞命。渠認為此次遇刺未遂，實屬上蒼所示之佳兆，此次　謀之主動者與軍隊并無關係，故毫不損及軍隊之榮譽，渠已委任為姆拉為國內防軍司令。希氏之演詞稱：「余向全國演說之目的有二，一則使民衆得聆余之聲音而知余無恙，二則使民衆得知此次德國史上空前罪行詳情。專緣有一小部份毫無良心而有野心之愚蠢罪犯，與一部無知之軍官會謀，欲將余及德軍最高指揮之全體幕僚殺害，史都芬堡上校所放置之炸彈，在距余二公尺爆發，余之幕僚多人受傷，其中一人已殞命，余則并未受傷，僅略有不重要之擦損及灼傷而已。余認為此乃天意欲余繼續追求余之目的，余可對全國隆重宣言，全自加入政府之後，其唯一之心志，即竭余之智能與良心，以盡余之職責，余已獻身為民衆兩晝夜努力，際此德軍方作最困苦戰鬥之時，竟有一極小部份人欲蹈義大利之覆轍，以為可師一九一八年之故智，暗刺德國之背，不知此次實屬絕大錯誤。此輩價篡之徒謂余已不復生存，已因余此次廣播而不攻自破，此輩僭纂份子為數極少，且與德國之　　　無關係，乃極少數之犯罪份子而已，對此輩將毫不留情加以撲滅。余現宣告任何軍隊任何組織之領袖及任何軍人皆不可率行此輩僭纂者之命令。任何人皆應檢舉為此輩傳達命令者如遇抵抗，即加以格殺。</p>
<p>軍事首腦表示効</p>
<p>柏林二十一日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：德空軍部長弋林上將曁海軍總司令　尼資海軍上將，均已向部下廣播命令，據稱，各該部下唯渠等之命是從，其有傳達偽令或勸誘服從偽令者，應即刻被捕而處死。兩上將對上蒼庛護元首，表示欣感，而對不逞之徒表示痛恨。竇上且將謂謀刺元首不靑將德人交付敵手。</p>
<p>上蒼默佑全民歡慰</p>
<p>柏林二十一日中央社電　海通社訊：德全國人民昨聞希特勒元遇刺未中之訊後，深為歡慰，關於犯罪之情形除透露以炸彈為武器外，其他詳情均未宣布，並預料警署於初步調查未完成前，不致有所發表。回憶德元首於一九三九年十一月八日在慕尼黑酒害第一次遇刺時，於出事十三日後始透露該案之詳情。德元首昨日再度遇刺，又幸得不受重傷，各方咸認得自天佑。德國副情報處長宋特曼稱：「德國之敵人企圖行刺希特勒元首，　等再度籍犯罪之手段，以助戰爭之進行，惟上蒼之決定適得其反，此次德元首遇刺未中，足證元有將在上蒼保護之下，必能完成其使命焉。</p>

<p>里斯本二十一日中央社電　據消息：羅斯福總統昨晚在太平洋海岸某海軍基地，自專車中廣播，接受為民主黨之總統候選人。渠稱，「際此愁苦之時期中，余不能依照向例，舉行競選運動，因余實無時間為此」。</p>

<h3>克恩區英軍南推遭堅强抵抗美軍向萊賽發動攻勢</h3>
<p>柏林二十一日中央社電德國新聞社訊：奧納河以東之大戰，星期三日仍在繼續進行，劇烈之狀況不減於前。由於英第二軍所受之巨大損失，英軍高級司令部不得不由後方急調後備兵以資整頓，並補充其破殘之編隊，但此等增援部隊亦不能獲得勝利。英軍與加拿大軍編隊由庫隆具兩·都弗萊離爾·與桑納維爾等區，沿展闊前綫發動新攻勢，但向前進行不滿二公里即被阻。位於該區內之埃米維爾·佛蘭奴維爾·沙里埃與蒲爾圭勃等地方均吿失守。同時由克恩前進之英軍抵達聖安特迤北之六七高地以及伊甫與朗勃特福里等地。向特洛恩猛攻之英坦克車編隊被擊退至原陣地，克恩之西南並無重要變化之消息。在桑洛區美軍大砲於星期三及星期四上午猛轟該處之德軍新陣地，維爾河之西德軍擊退美軍之一切進攻，德軍陣機中缺口一處，在反攻中加以堵合。維爾與杜特河間之美軍企圖驅逐德軍於高陣地之外，但其一切進攻均告勞而無功，敵對洛斯克。墨斯尼爾維高公路之冒險進攻亦吿失敗。星期四淸晨美軍向萊賽區發動新攻勢，但詳情尚未獲悉。</p>
<p>侵歐兵力四十師團</p>
<p>目下駐於諾曼第狹隘登陸岸頭之英美軍共有四十師團，其中至少有半數從事於現在之攻勢，此外登陸岸頭區內尚有不少砲兵分隊·先鋒編隊·以及其他特別分隊，雖有此強大軍隊與物質之集中，但蒙高茂萊將軍終未能擴大其作戰區域，英美軍之登陸岸頭其關度無一處在二十公里以上者。</p>
<h3>受飛彈襲擊英傷亡統計</h3>
<p>里斯本二十一日中央社電　據倫敦電：英內政當局頃發表六月間英本國人民遭空襲被害者，計　死者包括確認死亡及行踪不明者一九三五名，內男七一六名，女九八八名，兒童二三一各。　負傷及八院者計五·九〇六名，內男二。一五一名，女三·二六二名，兒童四九三各。其死傷者大半係由於流星彈於半月間之擊炸之所致。七月中之死者計六十八名，男二十六名，女三十二各，兒童十名。負傷者七十五名，男三十六名，女三十八各，兒童一名。兩月相較所差殊甚，由此可知流星炸彈具有如何巨大之威力。</p>
<p>瑞典京城二十一日中央社電　海通社訊：英公共衛生部大臣韋林克昨日在下院聲稱，自七月二日以還，倫敦疏散之婦孺已達十七萬名，內相莫理遜吿下院，渠將於下週報吿防禦流星彈之新警報制</p>
<h3>東綫中部蘇軍　展開全面攻勢　林堡爭奪戰尤為劇烈</h3>
<p>柏林二十一日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：最近二日間，東綫中部及南部之戰鬥，業已擴大至北部，蘇軍不得阻碍德軍行動，該方面刻正展開激戰中。南自勒伏甫（即林堡）北至庇斯柯夫南方之間，終日酣戰，其焦點現為勒伏甫東北。柯維爾西方·維爾那西北。特文斯克南方·及奧波齋加（Opochka）等區。南部地區勃洛第西方德軍，曾與有力之蘇軍戰車及狙擊兵師團展開激戰，柯維爾西方蘇軍雖曾以布格河上流為目標，向德軍追擊，但德軍安然渡過布格河。蘇軍刻開始大規模攻勢，企圖渡越尼門河，蘇軍現已到達尼門河西岸，且有二地點正展開激戰，經數小時戰鬥後，蘇軍被擊退。東綫北部戰鬥重點，為奧波齊加地區，蘇軍突破德軍陣地數處，但經德軍側面反攻，其突破口業被對鎖。</p>
<h3>馬利亞納海戰記　近代海戰的新姿態</h3>
<p>日美兩國艦隊在馬利亞納西方海面的會戰，日方取隨機應變的態勢，對敵方的來襲加以先制攻擊，獲得擊沈航空母艦五艘，戰艦一艘以上的大戰果，但敵的殘存部隊尚有相當數目。</p>
<p>敵方立在可以自由選擇攻擊目標的有科立塲，於六月十一日，前來攻擊馬利亞納羣島，先計劃破壞航空基地，使不能使用，敵飛機的速續轟炸與水上艦艇的艦砲射繫，畫夜無間，基地不免受相當損書。敵方的空母羣是愛塞克斯級（二萬六千噸）型及哥本斯與其他重巡洋艦改造的特設空母？護衛艦隊中的戰艦，是稱為量新的四萬五千噸的阿伊華型，三萬五千噸的南達柯泰型等。並使用相當多數的驅逐艦以供運輸，似有利用其速力以謀高速運輸之狀。</p>
<p>日艦載機先發制敵</p>
<p>至十五日在塞班島登陸後，重又增援航空母艦，補充飛機，以謀擴大登陸地點。此時，基地守備隊堅守陣地，陸上砲隊砲擊敵戰艦，命中艦尾的砲塔，引起大火災，或由潛水艦擊沈敵新型戰艦，基地航空部隊的新锐轟炸機，並重傷敵空母三艘以上，使之起火。</p>
<p>至十八日，敵對我聯合艦隊之一部秘密行動，似有急起擴大索敵綫模樣。然卒不能發見，十九日晨，乃受我母艦艦機的先制攻擊。</p>
<p>大艦隊與大艦隊的搏鬥，必須想像以外的準備，並須莫大的補給。記者對於我作戰的周到緻密，瞭如指掌，不勝驚嘆。戰機微妙，完全不能預料。在那確實把握先制攻擊機會的裊面，有着我索敵機（包括艦載水上偵察機）的偉功。</p>
<p>最近的敵機動部隊，以空母與新型戰艦互相組合，用戰艦的有力的對空砲火以補空母的弱點，在其外周，配置許多巡洋艦，驅逐艦，輪型陣有愈趨擴大之傾向。這大輪型陣與別的空母羣取得有機的聯絡，加以因電波探知器等的發達，奇襲完全不可能了。我攻擊機隊犧牲了五十架飛機，始突破這輸型陣，冒對空砲火攻擊敵空母，可見是一件如何困難的工作。</p>
<p>肉搏夜襲卒未實現</p>
<p>而在另一方面，乘先制攻擊的便利，再三　試的肉搏夜襲，卒未實現。絕對有利於我的水上艦艇之砲戰，一次也未曾發生，其原因在於機動部隊的戰鬥，因艦載機性能的向上而航速力增加，寶行遠距離空襲戰，加以敵的遁走極迅速的緣故。而且當時月色昏閽，加以彼戰的機動部隊以高速繼續移動，索敵工作遭過空前的困難。</p>
<p>來襲敵機擊落八成</p>
<p>說到飛機，日母艦艦載機羣絕對優秀，在俯衝轟炸中，雷整中，屢次戰了巨彈反復加以攻擊。敵方的反攻，僅有急降轟炸機，雷擊機反攻一次，且敵的急降轟炸機技術極拙劣，一機撤下許多小型炸彈，希望擲中。立於道種絕對條件之下，令艦隊的得以健在，並有敵的殘存者，完全因為在洋面上遠距離的作戰。而敵方絡續而來的母艦羣的「數」與補給的「量」乃發生差別。敵的基地攻擊極拙劣，膽小如鼠，在一千米上空用機槍掃射。來襲敵機五十架中，一舉擊落其四十架。駕駛技術不純熱，僅靠着亂擲定時炸彈，母子炸彈企圖獲得幾許效果。因這基地攻繫繼續不斷，致我基地航空部隊的活躍，被相富妨害。</p>
<p>敵來襲馬利亞納以來的綜合戰果，軍艦的擊沉擊毀，飛機的擊落，為數極鉅。但對敵的數量，尙不能說已給與決定的打擊，我方亦祇有用「量」來對抗「量」的攻擊。</p>
<p>不僅是飛機的量，水上艦艇，補給艦船，也都須「量」，而且基地的迅速整備修理，也須極力動員機械力，資源力。這祇有賴於各方面的飛躍的增強戰力。（翔：譯自七月八日朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>松島部長闡述　新閣成立意義　並報吿太平洋戰况</h3>
<p>盟邦日本駐華艦隊報道部松島部長，於昨（二十二）日午後在該部循例會見本市中國新聞記者團，就日新內閣成立與中太平洋最近戰况等，闡述頗詳。特誌其談話如左：</p>
<p>新閣產生爭取勝利</p>
<p>茲時機日趨嚴重之秋，自新內閣應命產生，本人身為日本軍人，對政治雖不容有所批評，但關於此事之見解，正如內閣情報局所發表：「與塞班島無絲毫之關連，絕不以該處戰局為標準，而為爭取最後勝利，而作之政治體系之調整。」開於其他種種，無庸本人　述，但深信塞班戰局，給予整個日本國民極大之覺悟，而更促進應意之激昻。自上次海軍大臣更換後，敵方即作如下論調，如由於瑪利亞納作戰失利而言等稱種無謂宣傳，企圖擾亂視聽，實則原因決不亦此。按海軍大臣之更迭，乃視整個戰局而定者，本人可進一步為諸位解釋，似此種，非但不是日本喘不能繼之拈置，反屬打開今後整個戰局之工作。</p>
<p>塞島經濟上無價値</p>
<p>其次關於中太平洋最近戰况，松島部長闡述如後：最近塞班為附近敵方若干潛艇，時向大宮島小島方面　動，曾數度施行轟炸·在吾方視地利亞納附近為一「養猪一塲」，其意即「俟其肥後即施屠宰」之謂，至於塞班島就經濟情形而論，除了能產極少數之砂糖而外，餘無甚價値可言。在軍本上言，雖有若干地點，可作機塲，但若欲供艦隊停舶之用，則絕不可能。所以吾人深信敵方今後定將移其主力，圖奪特魯克島，蓋彼處可作艦隊根據地故也。所以敵方若在「不敗勢態」上再繼續作戰，進犯特魯克，勢所必然，否則敵軍西進，須費相當時間。現在觀米內海軍大將任艦隊司令長官時英俊之風姿，吾人益覺有充分之把握，「不動經」中有「心住不動定，」吾人深信米內大將心中正與者人心境一樣。關於此事與最近留滬日僑之影響以言，可謂民氣極為激昻。本月二十日一天中，海軍武官府收到人民獻金竟超過七百六十萬元之鉅，以此可購十架以上之飛機。</p>
<p>塞島美軍損失重大</p>
<p>關於塞班島作戰，美太平洋艦隊司令長官尼米資會稱為美國有史以來之大損害，自六月十一日以迄七月十六日止，該艦隊在眾班附近所蒙損失，計佔該隊所有戰艦之百分之五十，航空母艦百分之六十，飛機百分之八十七，六月十九日尼米資在火奴魯魯廣播稱：「日木艦隊全部覆沒」，而在本月十八日之廣播中，却向國內發表「日艦隊之飛機尙屬健在，美國民須更努力增產」。似此於同一廣播電台，不逾月中，竟作相反之言論，實將敵美發表之不確程度，暴露無遺。同時尼米資更稱：「塞班雖經攻克，但今後戰爭之進展，將更形困難」。根據其所謂，吾人即可想像在塞班附近敵美所受損失之一般矣。又據本月二十日重慶廣播稱：美在緬句軍隊為作紀念起見，曾搜羅日本國旗，測其用途，不外預備於遭日軍攻學時作為掩護，或於對日投降時用。</p>
<p>剌德元首計劃失敗本月日倫敦路透社電云：「暗殺德元首希特勒之計劃失敗，希氏於僅受輕徵灼傷之餘，仍與　棄里尼會見」，由此我人更想起基督遭其門徒猶太之出賣，孔子去宋於樹下講禮樂時，桓　伐木，圖害孔子，與釋迦人忌其名而欲加害等事蹟，計劃暗殺希特勒之目的，吾人雖不能知，但須知凡一偉人之後，必有凡人惡人之作崇。若以暗殺希氏一節編為戲劇，將更有趣味。若於百年之後，史學者續至斯處，將作何感想。則日：「為眞義，吾人應奮鬥到底」。</p>
<p>漢口中日軍民團結</p>
<p>最後松島報道部長又謂，本人據最近由漢來滬之海軍武官稱，最近美機無分日夜至漢空製，漢市中日兩國軍民之團結精神，發揮無遺，當時本人曾詰以美機空襲漢口，華人受投之餘，定將謂由於日人之在漢口，所以美機來襲，使中國人民蒙受損失，但答覆適得其反，據稱：「於慘烈情况之下，中日兩國人民巳眞正發揮同生共死之精神。」最近中國方面對獻機運動，熱心異常，漢口市一月可獻機三架之多。本人逖聽之餘，非常感激，吾人於過去雖有許多問題，但與其說過去，不如說當前，吾人應如何消滅英美。</p>
<h3>百年前今日　德商禮和洋行　創辦人初次到滬之回憶</h3>
<p>距今百年前之七月十日，為德商禮和洋行創辦人卡羅威次君R．von　Carlowitz坷次劃滬之期：卡君於前清這光廿四年十一月二日：由德國白萊門港附船東行，船名「阿娜」及「愛禮柴」，係德商組織遠征隊之帆船，翌年三月二十九日抵新加坡，留駐一月，設立售曾處後，即賃兩桅船名「橫葛而』者赴澳門，復由澳門抵舟山甯波，時為同年六月二十一日，卡君在甬，聯絡當地華商，進行業務，備見順利，其經過情形，以及遊覽普陀等名聯，所得印象，最為美滿，曾在其家信中一一縷述，揄揚備至，聞者為之神往，繼於七月八日離甬，至十日而携其所售餘之商貨，登臨滬埠，亦即此築成德商東方之路綫者第一次蒞臨上海之日也，時上海已R.von　Carlowitz君次威羅卡於數年前根據南京條約開闢為通商口岸，各國商人紛集，學　在華發展其本國商業，卡君居滬製星期，攷察風土人情，商家需求，至為詳盡，嗣於八月一日重赴舟山，越香港，經廣州，歷印度爪圭諸商業地區而回國，因是見聞愈廣，情勢洞明，結果認為欲在華發展商業，應光在廣州設立商行，由此發軔，可推及全國各地，遂將其建議陳諸於德國遠征商隊之組織者，即德來比錫城巨商一喜察究』與『哈科特」C　Hirzel　　Co.,Carl及Gustao　Harkort等諸大公司是也，竟獲一致贊助，諸公司於一八四五年十月卅一日為之遍發通告，表示願為卡君新事業作有力之後盾，於是卡君與『哈特』君二人於一八四六年一月一日在廣州正式宣佈成立德商禮和洋行，開始營業，其後業務日見發達，迄今凡屬中國著名之城市，果皆有禮和洋行之分設，規模宏大，時人推為德商之首席，但追源溯始，要皆由卡君在百年前運用遠大之眼光，艱難締造之功焉。</p>

<h3>交大學費如何收法？</h3>
<p>— 翔駿</p>
<p>大攷還沒有完畢，同學之間已起了一陣騷動，“學費要增加了”，但是大家還多少帶著打趣與詼諧的成份，情形自然不見得怎樣嚴重，顯然地每個人似乎有些“漠不關心”，不過要說這個“漠不關心”是我們這批大學生的疏忽，卻又未必盡然。有人說工科學生善於分析事理，我們確實也會照常情加以推測，斷定決不致有怎樣劇變，其理由有十：</p>
<p>原收學費僅十元，即使漲上一百倍也只一千元，但決無突漲一百倍之理。　戰後各院校例有貸金助金之舉，原爲救濟戰區學生，並維護戰時教育。今　取消，但終不至反其道而加收學費。　政府歲收如何，同非吾人所知，但近年來顯有增加，況教育經費，向有的款，增加學費，自屬無需。　物價激漲，教授生活清苦—非但清苦，簡直不能生活，確屬實情；但觀其對於國家所負責任之艱鉅，使命之重大，應負救濟解決之賣者，自爲政府。　戰時教育自應適應戰時環境，造就專門人才，殆　當務之急中之尤急者，大學生多受特殊教育，即可供諸社會造福人羣，自若坐令失學，致功虧一簣，決非賢明政府所樂爲。　國家之強弱，端唯教育是賴，我國教育之不普遍，不發達，全世界幾可首屈一指，大學教育，尤幼稚得可憐，如今縱不思力謀改進與擴充，但現有嚴施，似應竭力維持，增收學費，增加學生負擔，　自理想。　政府威望爲立國之本，國立院校教授生活所需，亦須求之　生，其影響國民心理，殊匪淺鮮。　問題之解決，治本重於治標，教授之生活，爲全國國民生活之一　，自應予以通盤解決，方爲澈底，救了教授，苦了學生，挖肉補瘡，焉是辦法？　以交大言，自有其輝煌之歷史，崇高之地位，要非吾人　言，而全體教授才學出衆，埋頭苦幹之精神，尤其可嘉，論功行賞，政府似應特予青睞，額外爲之設法。　交大同學，多屬清寒，寒爲有目共睹，但其苦學精神，初未稍餒，政府自將特予體恤，決不致加深其苦痛。</p>
<p>種種因素，但不以爲將有若何嚴重難關，加諸吾人，但據消息靈通方面傳出，下學期之學費將爲三千至五千元，諦聽之下，不得不爲之駭異，而有些驚惶失措了。在目前這個數目，自不能謂鉅，殊不知苦讀學生，囊空如洗，書籍文具，已難於措辦，在“無事不要錢”之局面下，膳宿早成問題，平空增此鉅額支出，其雖堪情狀，不難想像。</p>
<p>際此決戰方　，同舟共濟，殆爲國民應有之道養責任，吾人自極體諒政府之苦處，不願有所苛求或奢望，但窮教授之生活必得解決，而苦學生之負擔尤不能令其加重，惟　政府慎重將事，予以圓滿之處置。</p>
<p>加費如是之鉅，但願其所傳不確，不幸而已爲當局所決定，則唯有希望重加改　，社會人士自亦不應坐視，吾人有待於同情者之援手也。</p>
<h3>預防上川路肇禍市公用局的答復</h3>
<p>上海特別市公用局昨來函雲：“閱十五日貴報國民論壇　內，程瑛明君所撰之“預防上川鐵路肇禍向公用局提出建議”一文，對於上川路之損壞情形，以及行車困難，管理　易，方簡意賅，判制允當，所提出之建議二則，亦屬不刊之論，良深佩韋。本處爲預防肇禍計，對於車輛載重，早在極力減低中，寧可犧牲收入，對於大宗貨物，尤其是食鹽，拒絕裝運，最近數月中，列車出軌事件，並未發生，已收實效。一方面儘力籌款，添購枕木，以備局部修換，而保交通安全，程君所提議之就地徵購民間樹木辦法，今年三月間，本處曾經草擬辦法，呈請市府核准，嗣因辦理手續繁複，徵購價格，甚難公允，後更因市府鑒於民間樹木，斫伐過多，明令禁止，本處不得不將該項計劃中止進行，另行委託商人，向浙東採購枕木五千根，於本年五月十七日，訂定合同，現在該項枕木均已集中寧波，待船運滬，最短期內即可擇尤更換，興修路面。際茲戰時物資缺乏，採辦匪易，即使財力不生問題，亦難達到平時建設目的，故發行公　，及附加車票等籌欵辦法，目前尚無必要。上海特別市公用局上川上南兩路管理處啓。”</p>
<h3>市民消費合作社的答復</h3>
<p>市民消費合作社來函雲：“閱本月二十日貴報國民論壇“市民消費合作社何時可以配貨”一文，不得不聲明一二，以明真相。查本社於去年六月間成立時，原擬向各業聯合會接洽多量配給物資，以求解決市民生活壓迫，不料成立後，環境日非，而各業聯合會均自顧不暇，無法取得物資，此爲共見之事實。故本社僅能以黑市購入，以黑市配給，試辦三次，終感不能滿意。至去年十一月間，物資更形缺乏，乃召開第二屆理監事會議，決定再將配給剩餘之物資，盡量配給社員，收回社證，以謀結束。當將此項消息宣布各報，並通知社員在卷，惟一部份社員並不來社領取配給物資，亦不來社辦理退社手續，以致本社未能結束，爲節省開支起見，範圍不得不加縮小。惟本社無論如何總不使社員之利益有所損害，現正準備最後一次之配給，以資結束，俟定有期日，再行通告。上海市民消費合作社啓。”</p>

<h3>海軍</h3>
<p>— 岩田豐雄著　羊譯</p>
<p>血與淚（一）</p>
<p>山崖下麵的小道上，汽車奔馳著，眨眼間到校門。在門前，真人付了車資。</p>
<p>一進門口，細砂道非常的清潔，中間作成庭園式，而擺列著石頭，開放著杜鵑花。在中心的台子上，陳列著兩艘小潛水艇，這是稱潛航艇時代的艦體。用白字寫著“六”的字樣的一艘前面，祭祀著一個小廟。這就是潛水艇神社。</p>
<p>真人站在廟的前面，唯恭唯謹地實行敬禮說：</p>
<p>“這就是佐久間上尉的六號艇。這個廟是祭祀一切爲國犧牲者。這些烈士，與其說是潛水學校的守護神，而倒莫如說是帝國潛水艇的守護神。…喂，在這個地稍微等一下。我把新田招呼來。”</p>
<p>說完就跑到下正面的樓房裏去了。</p>
<p>隆夫也知道佐久間上尉的壯烈殉國事迹，所以在心裏偷偷地加以禮拜，然後對於這個樹葉式的六號艇，仔細加以觀察。隆夫因爲讀過海軍文　，所以明白初期潛航艇是荷蘭型，抑還是單　式。不久後，其人就拖著新田少尉出現了。</p>
<p>“隆夫，你這個傢夥真有運氣。星期天教務長還在，一會兒要來看你的。這是因爲新田介紹給他，說你是一位海軍畫家。”</p>
<p>真人像自己的事情一樣，非常高興。隆夫也向新田少尉道了謝。</p>
<p>“不值一謝。那末我就領導諸位參觀校舍吧！今天是休息天，沒有課……”</p>
<p>少尉說著，開始搖擺著大屁股向前走了。</p>
<p>作業室是另外築成的，到處都有。有操舵，機關，水雷等各種作業室，但因是休息天，全上著鎖，所以只好站在窗外看看。</p>
<p>“將來會給你看實在東西的，此處這樣看看也就可以了。”</p>
<p>後來新田少尉，領到校舍去。那個地方有練習生的水兵起居和學習學科的所在，但多半都因星期天而出校了，現在顯得格外　靜。</p>
<p>須臾間，又跑到練習生的寢室去。有數根大棟柱，在支持著這個大廈，下面有很多長棹和長凳在排列著。並且步槍架，皮鞋架，也全都井然有序地擺列著，但都很緊地放在一起。</p>

        <h1>1944 - n200</h1>
<h3>The Enlightenment of Industrialists</h3>
<p>The recent six-month decline in the stock market fully demonstrates the errors in the past operational policies of Shanghai industrialists. Seeking individual exorbitant profits through speculation, trickery, manipulation, and other means ultimately harms the public and the nation. It prevents national capital from being accumulated into state capital, causing Chinese industry to regress hundreds of steps. It also invisibly destroys most of Shanghai's already limited industrial foundation. All of these are worthy of reflection by industrialists today.</p>
<p>Mr. Tosuke Yoshida once said: "If 1944 is the year of stock speculation and the era of 'industrial companies,' then 1944 is like the third stage of tuberculosis, requiring a determined treatment; otherwise, the patient is incurable." The past six months have fully exposed the symptoms, eliminating the need for examination and diagnosis. The current problem is to quickly seek treatment, and the industrialists themselves must realize that this is a pathological condition. They must immediately and thoroughly change their policies, only then can they be saved.</p>
<p>Firstly, industrialists should realize that they must henceforth start with honest, down-to-earth agriculture and industry. Any enterprise that does not have agriculture and industry as its foundation is not a true industry. To be separate from agriculture and industry, or to use the guise of agriculture and industry while trading stocks, is a sham industry, not a real industry. Even from a commercial perspective, it cannot be considered legitimate commerce. This kind of illegitimate commerce is not only unhelpful to agriculture and industry, but harmful. It adds to the instability of the national livelihood and harms the people's welfare. During times of national war and when the people are enduring suffering, when agriculture and industry are striving to increase production, we cannot tolerate such disruptive, opportunistic, and harmful behavior. Even if the government does not immediately punish it, public opinion will not tolerate it, and public opinion will determine whether an individual or an organization has any value in society. "What ten eyes see and ten fingers point at" may be an invisible force, but it has the greatest authority, and we hope everyone pays attention.</p>
<p>Secondly, industrialists should realize that they can no longer only seek their own selfish interests. All industries need social support. The capital of industry requires investment from the public, and the products of industry require purchase by the public. A large enterprise must first establish credibility in society. It must ensure that investors receive the benefits of their investment and that consumers have convenience in using its products. Only in this way can its industry expand and progress. Only by pursuing the interests of the masses can individual interests be obtained. Only when the masses have interests can individual interests be guaranteed and enjoyed. An industry needed by the masses and supported by the masses is a permanent industry. An industry that only creates opportunities for private wealth may deceive for a time, but it cannot be sustained permanently.</p>
<p>Thirdly, industrialists should realize that now is the opportunity to establish a foundation for national revival. War is destruction, but it is also construction. During this war period, look at other countries and see how many new inventions and new constructions there are. Then look at China; there is practically nothing new. Yet, now we are about to destroy even the smallest bit of the old foundation. Taking Shanghai as an example, what has been painstakingly managed in the past is being destroyed not by war, but by speculation. Those in charge, when they reflect in the quiet of the night, the reproach of their conscience is unforgivable. Taking advantage of this little foundation, seeking progress and innovation during wartime, and seeking revival and expansion after the war are all things that benefit oneself and the country, and are worthy of deep thought and consideration by everyone.</p>
<p>Dear industrialists, over the past few years, what has been the material gain or loss of yourselves and the enterprises you manage? What has been the gain or loss in reputation? We don't need to make this profit and loss statement; you are all perfectly clear about it. Which path you should take from now on, you should all of course decide for yourselves. The public is watching your transformation with anticipation. Whether you become supporters of the masses or opponents of the masses depends on the performance you show in the future.</p>
<h3>Smooth Progress in Forming Japanese Cabinet; Powerful Government to Be Established Soon; List of Cabinet Members Completed Last Night</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) Lieutenant General Heita Fujii of the Cabinet Formation Headquarters announced at 8:30 PM on the 21st, stating: "The cabinet formation work is proceeding very smoothly. A powerful cabinet will be established immediately. The selection of cabinet ministers and the three top officials of the cabinet can be completed tonight. The list of cabinet members is scheduled to be presented to the palace on the morning of the 22nd."</p>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) The Cabinet Formation Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on the 21st, stating that Generals Koiso and Yonai are working tirelessly through the night, separately conducting cabinet formation. After 1:00 PM today, visitors to the Cabinet Formation Headquarters included General Nobuyuki Abe, Supreme Commander of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, State Minister Fujiwara, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, Finance Minister Ishiwatari, President of the Japan Distribution Corporation, and Viscount Keizo Shibusawa.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) Lieutenant General Saito met with a group of reporters at 1:00 PM today and issued the following statement: General Koiso visited President Abe of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association and returned to the Cabinet Formation Headquarters at 11:30 AM. As of now, visitors to the Cabinet Formation Headquarters include General Jiro Minami of the Army and Vice Admiral Seizo Sakonji of the Navy.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) Lieutenant General Saito met with a group of reporters at 9:00 AM on the 21st and issued the following statement: After General Koiso of the Army and Admiral Yonai of the Navy received the imperial order to form a cabinet on the 20th and left the Imperial Palace, General Koiso immediately went to the Prime Minister's official residence to visit Prime Minister Tojo. He then went to the General Staff Headquarters to visit Chief of Staff Yoshijiro Umezu for various consultations before returning to the Cabinet Formation Headquarters at 8:00 PM. Admiral Yonai visited Naval Minister Nomura and arrived at the Cabinet Formation Headquarters at 8:10 PM to hold various discussions with General Koiso. Subsequently, General Koiso departed from the Cabinet Formation Headquarters at 9:30 PM to visit Minister of the Imperial Household Kido, Chief of the Naval General Staff Shimada, and Naval Minister Nomura, only returning at 12:50 AM. He then held discussions with Admiral Yonai until 4:22 AM on the 21st. Generals Koiso and Yonai continued their discussions in a spirit of sincerity and cooperation, and the progress was very smooth. According to reports, Lieutenant General Heita Saito of the Army (Advisor to the Governor-General of Korea) and Lieutenant General Haruji Ninomiya of the Army, President of Mantetsu, accompanied Governor-General Koiso to Haneda at 2:58 PM on the 20th and immediately went to the Cabinet Formation Headquarters at the Office of the Governor-General of Korea in Tamura-cho, Shiba Ward.</p>
<h3>Key Task of New Cabinet Is to Vigorously Complete the War; Imperial Rule Assistance Association Decides to Provide Full Assistance</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) After General Koiso of the Army and Admiral Yonai of the Navy received the imperial order to form a cabinet, they worked tirelessly day and night. They worked continuously from 8:00 PM on the 20th until dawn at 4:00 AM on the 21st before resting. At 8:00 AM, they returned to the Cabinet Formation Headquarters and consulted with their aides to continue the cabinet formation work. At 10:30 AM, General Koiso left the Cabinet Formation Headquarters and visited General Nobuyuki Abe, President of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, at the Association's headquarters for about 40 minutes before departing and returning to the Cabinet Formation Headquarters. It is reported that the Cabinet Formation Headquarters, recognizing the gravity of the situation, is placing special emphasis on completing the war in its cabinet formation policy. The aim is to form a powerful cabinet, and key tasks are underway to realize the cabinet formation plans of Koiso and Yonai. The two generals are also proceeding with great enthusiasm and cooperation, carefully handling matters in order to form a cabinet as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) General Koiso and Admiral Yonai have received the imperial order to form a cabinet. The previous instance of such a joint cabinet formation was on June 27, 1898, when Count Shigenobu Okuma and Count Taisuke Itagaki formed a cabinet, exactly 46 years ago. The emergence of this joint cabinet in Japan this time is different from the previous situation. The two generals, elders of the Army and Navy responsible for the decisive battle in the Greater East Asia War and enjoying popular support, are now cooperating happily, standing at the forefront of 100 million soldiers and civilians. The significance is very profound. The more severe the war situation, the closer the cooperation between the Army and Navy. The expectations for the new cabinet are based on this point. At the time of the Okuma-Itagaki cabinet, Count Okuma served as Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, while Count Itagaki served as Interior Minister, and it was created by enlisting powerful figures from political parties. This time, the new cabinet is also composed of people who are sincerely shouldering the heavy responsibility of the nation, needless to say. The formation of the cabinet by the two generals is to respond to the intensifying war situation and to succeed the heroic battle spirit of Vice Admiral Nagumo of the Navy and Lieutenant General Saito of the Army, who died in battle at Saipan. In terms of establishing a domestic system, it is to strengthen the war system of unity between the Army and Navy, gather the total strength of the nation, and advance towards the path of destroying the United States and Great Britain. The future is worthy of great anticipation.</p>
<p>Imperial Rule Assistance Association Holds Extraordinary General Affairs Meeting</p>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) After General Koiso was ordered to organize a successor cabinet, he visited President Abe of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association at the Association's headquarters at 10:30 AM on the 21st to explain the intention of jointly forming a cabinet with Admiral Yonai this time. In this critical situation, he requested the full cooperation and assistance of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association and exchanged opinions frankly. The President agreed to consult with various organizations in the Association and then respond. Therefore, the Imperial Rule Assistance Association held an extraordinary standing general affairs meeting at 12:30 PM this afternoon, followed by an extraordinary general affairs meeting from 2:00 PM. First, President Abe reported on the purpose of this meeting and then began various discussions. During the meeting, Advisor Rentaro Mizuno presented his views, stating that in view of the urgency of the current situation, the Imperial Rule Assistance Association should provide full cooperation and support for various policies that have already been finalized. He hoped that the new cabinet would implement these policies and requested the President to consult with them. This was unanimously approved, and a decision was made to fully assist. The President was given full discretion. Abe then went to the Cabinet Formation Headquarters at 2:55 PM to meet with Koiso and Yonai and formally conveyed the intention of cooperation and held various discussions.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) After the Tojo cabinet resigned en masse the day before yesterday, the Director-General of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association issued a special statement on the 20th, stating that the war will of 100 million people will not be shaken by any change in the cabinet. Let the hearts of the 100 million people and people throughout Greater East Asia be refreshed, and establish a strong and powerful wartime cabinet to advance towards the path of completing the war. He also emphasized that the successor cabinet should be bold and decisive, gather the total strength of the nation, and address the current extraordinary decisive battle situation.</p>
<h3>Fifth Cooperation Conference</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) The first day of the fifth Central Cooperation Conference of Japan is scheduled to be held at 1:30 PM in the Grand Conference Hall of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association Headquarters. After the formalities are completed, the first and second departments will begin discussions at 9:00 AM, focusing on the written opinions submitted by 35 council members to discuss raising the spirit of decisive battle. The first department will focus on ideological decisive battle and national guidance, while the second department will focus on the basics of guidance personnel, organization, and empowering the people to express their opinions. Each of the 226 cooperation council members will have the right to speak for one day. This conference is more practical than in the past, and each department member will express their opinions based on their experience and boldly raise discussions. It is expected that the effectiveness of the National Assembly will be further strengthened.</p>
<h3>German Government Welcomes the Formation of a New Cabinet in Japan; United States Recognizes That Japan Is Strengthening Its Wartime System</h3>
<p>Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency) The German government is very concerned about the fact that Generals Koiso and Yonai have been ordered to organize a new cabinet under this decisive battle situation. The German Foreign Ministry met with reporters on the 20th and stated: "When new events occur, new figures are put in charge of the situation. This is a frequent occurrence in Japan. The emergence of such new events in Japan, with the allied nation of Japan forming a government on a very broad foundation, is something that the government welcomes most. During this great war, it is difficult for belligerent countries to avoid difficulties in the war situation. Germany deeply understands that under such circumstances, the entire country must unite and devote all its efforts. The change of cabinet in Japan is not only a manifestation of Japan's political normality, but also a factual expression of Japan's determination to strengthen the war effort with new people."</p>
<p>Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency) According to a Washington dispatch, American political circles seem to attach great importance to the mass resignation of the Tojo cabinet in Japan. Secretary of State Hull and Undersecretary Patterson mentioned this matter when they met with reporters on the 20th. Grew, the former ambassador to Japan and the current Director of the East Asian Bureau of the State Department, also issued a statement, stating that Japan's wartime system will inevitably be further strengthened as a result of the cabinet change. He warned the American people not to be optimistic about the future of the war against Japan. For example, Secretary of State Hull stated: "After Japan's cabinet change, we must fully realize that Japan has re-established and improved its war plans." Undersecretary Patterson also stated: "The change of cabinet in Japan will inevitably appoint the strongest and bravest commanders to the key positions in the Army and Navy." The following is the gist of Grew's statement: "Although the Japanese cabinet has changed, Japan's war policy of fighting to the end has not changed. The traditional spirit of the Japanese people, who are not afraid of life and death, is deeply rooted. It is dangerous for the American people to feel optimistic about the future or make hopeful observations simply because of the Japanese cabinet change."</p>
<p>Great Expectations</p>
<p>Hsinking, 21st (Central News Agency) The Manchukuo government is deeply grateful that Generals Koiso and Yonai have been ordered to jointly form a cabinet and has great expectations for the future of the new cabinet. It is believed that the new cabinet will be more resolute and have a greater determination to fight, and will be able to refresh domestic affairs and increase production. On this day of the decisive battle in the Greater East Asia War, this new cabinet will be stronger and more powerful in building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, so that the peoples of Greater East Asia can unite as one and launch a general offensive against the enemy. Manchukuo has particularly high expectations for this. No matter how the Japanese cabinet changes, Manchukuo's important mission as a joint base for Greater East Asia remains the same. Based on the spirit of the inseparable foundation of Japan and Manchukuo, it will gather the total strength of the nation and advance together towards the path of destroying the United States and Great Britain and completing the Greater East Asia War.</p>

<h3>Interview with New Minister of Justice Chen Enpu</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 21st (Central News Agency) The National Defense Council approved on the 20th the special appointment of Chen Enpu as Minister of Judicial Administration.

<h3>National Government Awards Medals to Italian Envoys</h3>

<h3>Pillar of the Japanese Navy; Admiral Yonai Is Most Trusted; Admiral Fujita Discusses His Achievements</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) Admiral Takanori Fujita, a friend of Admiral Yonai for 40 years, spoke about Admiral Yonai as follows: "There are many admirals in the Navy, but the most trusted is Admiral Yonai. Although the Admiral is not particularly talented, he is honest and trustworthy, which can be said to be his greatest characteristic. Thanks to his strong cooperation with the late Marshal Yamamoto, the Japanese Navy was not even slightly shaken, and he was always responsible for carrying out all duties. When he was appointed Commander of the Chinkai Naval Base, he suddenly received an order to return to Tokyo from Chinkai, at which time he thought he was being placed in the reserve. After that, he was out of the public eye for a long period, before successively serving as Commander of the Combined Fleet, Minister of the Navy, and Prime Minister. He also served as Minister of the Navy in the Yonai cabinet. After the Hiranuma cabinet resigned en masse, when he served as a military councilor, although he claimed to be free, the Navy, which had great trust in him, did not allow him to retire in this way. He received the imperial order to form a cabinet in January of the 15th year of Showa (1940). At that time, the Navy, in addition to saying goodbye, even advocated that he should remain in active service, but the Admiral resigned on the grounds of following precedent. As these facts show, the Admiral is still in a key position in the Navy. Although he is in the reserve, he is still the pillar of the Navy."</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Specifically Clarifies Recent Important Measures; Standards for Tuition Fees to Be Submitted to the Ministry for Approval</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 21st (Central News Agency) The Ministry of Education met with Chinese and foreign journalists on the 21st and issued the following statement: There are some recent important measures of the Ministry that need to be specifically clarified: Tuition fees: 1. After local authorities formulate standards for collecting tuition fees, they must submit a special report to the Ministry for approval before the start of the school year. 2. Tuition fees must be collected in cash and not in kind. 3. Schools at all levels must earnestly set up free tuition quotas to avoid students dropping out of school due to financial difficulties. 4. Local educational administrative authorities are responsible for supervising the collection of tuition fees by private schools. 5. Any acts of fraud that occur in connection with the collection of tuition fees will be severely punished. 6. All points stipulated by the Ministry must be strictly observed. School system and curriculum: Regarding the question of whether the current school system and curriculum standards in our country should be changed, the National Education Administration Conference previously resolved to organize a committee to conduct in-depth research. This work is currently underway and is expected to be completed as soon as possible. Before they have been approved and promulgated, no unauthorized changes are permitted. Registration of private schools: On the one hand, the Ministry has formulated regulations to encourage private donations for education. On the other hand, it has promulgated regulations for the registration of private schools as a means of supervision and guidance. Private schools that have not been registered have been ordered by local education authorities to urge them to complete the registration procedures, otherwise they will be banned. Scientific terminology: The Ministry plans to review scientific terminology in detail in the near future to seek uniformity and lay the foundation for scientific education. Promotion of the national standard pronunciation: The Ministry has repeatedly ordered schools in various places to pay attention to the national standard pronunciation in the national language course. It has also stipulated that the subject should be included as a compulsory course in summer training courses held in various places. The Ministry is also planning to establish a National Standard Pronunciation Training Institute, and the planning and preparation are currently underway.</p>
<h3>Yu Army in Southern China Surrounded; Japanese Army Occupies Lingshan; Attacks Enemy's Flank to Cut Off Their Retreat Route</h3>
<p>A Former Red Base of the Japanese Army in Southern China, 21st (Central News Agency) The Japanese Army's Southern China troops pursued the Yu Army of the 7th War Area in a dragon and phoenix configuration, trapping them in a dilemma. In the past twenty days, they captured Longmen, about 100 kilometers north of Guangzhou. The elite troops of the Japanese flanking unit, with Lingshan, about 24 kilometers north of Longtan Market in Zengcheng, as their base, aimed to annihilate the enemy's 153rd Division, which was about 32 kilometers north of Zengcheng. At midnight on the 13th, they began a surprise attack, advancing north to the right bank of the Zengjiang River. A flanking unit, from the direction of Fuluo Market (about 20 kilometers northeast of Zengcheng), stormed into the enemy's flank and cut off their retreat route. By the evening of the 14th, they successively occupied the key enemy strongholds of Zhuling (8 kilometers north of Zengcheng), Kengkoushi (14 kilometers north of Zengcheng), and Daloushan (16 kilometers north of Zengcheng). Under the cover of Japanese artillery fire from Daloushan, they pursued the fleeing Yu enemy across the Zengjiang River. At about 5:00 PM, they broke into Zhongyue Village. At dawn on the 15th, enemy troops from Baojiao Hill resisted from Fukuzhou Hill in three directions towards Longtan Market. The Japanese army shelled them simultaneously in three directions, launching a mountain battle. At that time, the Japanese flag on the right side was raised, and the enemy troops fled to the Paitan Market plain before noon. The enemy's entire main force fled rapidly towards Lingshan. The Japanese army launched a surprise attack on Lingshan from dawn on the 16th in a melee battle, defeating the counterattacking enemy. By 10:00 AM, they had completely occupied Lingshan, and the Japanese troops are continuing to mop up the remaining enemies.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Front Line in Southern China, 21st (Central News Agency) The Japanese Army launched a major encirclement and annihilation battle centered on Fenshuihuan Mountain and Dadong Market. The 3,300 Yu enemy troops fled left and right within the Japanese iron ring. On the 16th and 17th, some fled north to Yuexu, and others fled west.

The Japanese troops, consisting of about 1,000 men, attacked the stubborn enemy from the north and west around Fenshuihuan Mountain starting on the evening of the 13th. They fiercely engaged in close combat north of Fenshuihuan Mountain, killing about 600 enemies and causing them to flee north. After cutting off the retreat route of the enemy's large flanking unit west of Fenshuihuan Mountain, the Japanese unit, passing through Miaoping and Dafutian, surrounded about 2,000 enemy troops fleeing west near Fushiping, inflicting a serious blow on them. The enemy fleeing north with no way to retreat was surrounded by the Japanese army near Huangdongping, becoming rats in a sack. A thorough blow was given from the west, resulting in about 1,300 killed or wounded.

<h3>Successful River Crossing Operation – Japanese Troops Capture Chaling – Fierce Battles Unfold in the Urban Area of Hengyang</h3>
<p>Hunan Front Line of the Japanese Army, 21st (Central News Agency) – The battle to capture Chaling, a stronghold of the Chongqing Ninth War Area forces, is currently underway. The area is a steep mountain range with an elevation of 900 meters and a major strategic point. The enemy has deployed a portion of the 44th Army north of Chaling and the main force of the 20th Army in Chaling, coordinating with the 6th and 58th Armies in Lingling in an attempt to prevent the Japanese army from advancing. Japanese advancing units continued their attack on the enemy north of Chaling and launched a general offensive on Chaling at dawn on the 14th, forcibly crossing the Mo River. The enemy constructed defensive positions along the Mo River, putting up fierce resistance, and the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing provided air support in an attempt to stop the Japanese forces from crossing the river. After eight hours of intense fighting, the Japanese left-wing forces broke through on the eastern side of the city and engaged in street fighting. They continued to pursue the defeated enemy, and by 4:00 PM on the 14th, they had completely occupied the city. On the same day, they linked up with Japanese troops crossing the Mo River from the north. The enemy, due to the speed of the Japanese advancing forces, collapsed and fled in panic, leaving behind years of accumulated military supplies, which were all seized by the Japanese army.</p>
<p>Hunan Front Line of the Japanese Army, 21st (Central News Agency) – Hengyang has been under tight siege by Japanese forces since the beginning of this month and has fallen into a state of despair. With the arrival of strong reinforcements, the occupation of the airport on the east bank of the Xiang River, and a portion of the city, as well as securing river crossing points, the Japanese army has now established a complete line of attack. Since the 12th, they have launched a fierce offensive on Hengyang City, and Japanese units are currently engaged in a large-scale annihilation operation. The Japanese vanguard, on June 26th, with only a small number of troops, launched a surprise attack on the airport, seized military facilities, and captured a large amount of military supplies, inflicting a fatal blow on the enemy. A portion of the force crossed the Xiang River to coordinate with the attacking forces in the southeast. At the same time, a powerful force continuing to conduct a roundabout attack appeared in the Pei River area west of Hengyang City on the 28th, thereby completing a large horseshoe-shaped encirclement from the north, southwest, and west. The enemy, relying on numerous trenches scattered around the perimeter of Hengyang, resisted in layers, suppressing the enemy to the city center. The enemy's 10th Army, consisting of the 2nd and 48th Divisions, and a portion of the 151st Division, totaling approximately 20,000 men, although fighting back, have been forced to retreat to the southwest. Relying on the abundant resources of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing, aircraft flew over Hengyang to counterattack, but the Japanese forces, in addition to guarding the city's perimeter to prevent enemy soldiers from escaping, also distributed leaflets urging surrender to the enemy, whose morale was rapidly declining. However, the repeatedly defeated enemy did not cease resistance, so the Japanese army launched a spirited general offensive from all directions outside the city, initiating a grand and heroic annihilation operation.</p>
<p>Air Force in Fierce Battle Shoots Down Chongqing Aircraft</p>
<p>A Certain Japanese Army Air Base, 21st (Central News Agency) – On the mainland battlefield, on the 19th, a Japanese fighter squadron engaged in a fierce battle with thirteen P-40 type aircraft attempting to disrupt the Japanese supply depot over a certain area, shooting down five of them (two unconfirmed) and destroying one. The Japanese aircraft safely returned to their base. Also, on the same day, a Japanese fighter squadron attacked Hengyang. When the squadron arrived over a certain area, it suddenly encountered more than ten Chongqing P-40 fighter aircraft. The Japanese squadron immediately took up battle positions and engaged in a minor skirmish. After a fierce attack, they destroyed two Chongqing aircraft, causing them to crash.</p>
<p>Chongqing and US Aircraft Bombing Changsha - Hunan Daily Frontline Report, 20th (Central News Agency) – The Chongqing and US Air Forces blindly bombed Changsha on the 10th of this month. Japanese ground troops bravely fought back, and no military facilities or supplies in the city were lost. However, 250 ordinary citizens were killed, and 800 houses were destroyed or burned. For days, enemy aircraft continuously dropped 50 kg to 100 kg bombs on the city, instantly turning it into a dragon of black smoke with flames soaring into the sky. Citizens fled in a panic, and Japanese troops rushed to the rescue, saving more than half of the refugees. At the same time, the Japanese army also dispatched medical teams, with significant results. However, the refugees' homes were destroyed by fire, and wives and children were separated, wandering the streets everywhere, all deeply resenting the brutality of the Americans. The enemy aircraft's indiscriminate bombing undoubtedly adopted a scorched-earth tactic, completely disregarding the lives of the citizens, and this kind of atrocity only aroused anti-American sentiment among the populace.</p>
<h3>Intense Fighting on Both the East and West Coasts of Italy</h3>
<p>Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency) – The German News Agency reports: The focus of the Italian campaign remains on the coastal regions on both sides and the Montelupone area. In general, the German rearguard (some of which have been reinforced) has been able to repel all attacks by British and American forces. In the Livorno coastal area, American forces continue to exert pressure north of the town. In the evening, the invading forces engaged in fierce street fighting with the German rearguard, and the German forces inflicted serious losses on the American forces. Afterward, the German rearguard followed orders to withdraw along the road leading north from Pisa to Livorno. In the Montelupone area, American forces launched six attacks, but when they realized they could not advance, they ceased their attacks. The British Eighth Army launched smaller pushes in the nearby eastern area, but their offensive was halted before it reached the German lines. On the Adriatic flank, British tank units, followed by infantry composed of Polish mercenaries, crossed the Esino River after fierce fighting. Prior to this, the German forces had withdrawn to the high ground behind the river, unhindered by the enemy.</p>

<h3>Assassination Plot Ultimately Fails - German Leader Safe and Sound - Broadly Broadcasts to the Public Afterwards Denouncing the Crime</h3>
<p>Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency) – The German Leader's Headquarters announced on the 20th: As a result of an attempt to assassinate Leader Hitler with explosives, several members of the staff were seriously or lightly injured, but Leader Hitler only suffered burns and bruises. After being injured, he continued to work and met with Commander Mussolini at the scheduled time. After the incident, General Göring had already arrived at the Leader's Headquarters.</p>
<p>Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency) – The German News Agency reports, according to official announcements: Those seriously injured in the explosion include General Schmundt and Colonel Brandt; those lightly injured include General Heusinger, General Korten, General Buhle, General Bodenschatz, and General Hausinger. The so-called Leader's Headquarters is where Leader Hitler and his staff oversee military and state affairs, but the exact location has not been determined.</p>
<p>Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency) – Reuter reports: According to sources in charge, General Jodl, Chief of the German Armed Forces, was not injured, but Leader's Secretary Scherff died from his injuries.</p>
<p>Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency) – Reuter reports: According to qualified sources this morning, all the conspirators who plotted to assassinate the German Leader have either committed suicide or been executed. Colonel Stauffenberg, who planted the bomb, has also been executed, and others involved in the matter will be charged with conspiracy. It is said that no other incidents have occurred elsewhere, and this conspiracy has completely failed.</p>
<p>The Initiator of the Conspiracy Is Not Related to the Military</p>
<p>Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency) – German Leader Hitler broadcast to the nation this morning, stating that although he was assassinated yesterday, he was not injured and is still very well. He said that the bomb was planted by Colonel Stauffenberg and exploded a few meters away. Many of his closest staff members were injured, and one died. He believes that this failed assassination attempt is a good omen from heaven. The initiator of this conspiracy has no relation to the military, so it does not damage the honor of the military in any way. He has appointed Himmler as Commander of the Domestic Defense Forces. Hitler's speech stated: "The purpose of my address to the nation is twofold: first, to let the people hear my voice and know that I am well, and second, to let the people know the details of this unprecedented crime in German history. Due to a small number of unconscionable and ambitious stupid criminals, colluding with some ignorant military officers, wanting to kill me and the entire staff of the German High Command, the bomb planted by Colonel Stauffenberg exploded two meters away from me. Many of my staff were injured, and one has died, but I was not injured, only slightly bruised and burned. I believe this is Heaven's will for me to continue pursuing my goals. I can solemnly declare to the nation that since joining the government, my only ambition has been to dedicate my intelligence and conscience to fulfilling my responsibilities. I have dedicated myself to working for the people day and night. At this time when the German army is fighting its most difficult battles, a very small group of people wants to repeat Italy's mistakes, thinking they can imitate the old trick of 1918, stabbing Germany in the back, not knowing that this is a huge mistake. These usurpers claim that I am no longer alive, which is refuted by my broadcast. These usurpers are very few in number and have nothing to do with Germany’s, they are just a small number of criminals who will be ruthlessly eliminated. I now declare that no leader of any army or organization and no soldier shall follow the orders of these usurpers. Anyone should report those who convey orders for these people, and if they resist, they should be killed on the spot."</p>
<p>Military Leaders Express Loyalty</p>
<p>Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency) – The German News Agency reports: German Air Force Minister Göring and Navy Commander-in-Chief Dönitz have both broadcast orders to their subordinates, stating that their subordinates should only follow their orders, and anyone who conveys false orders or induces obedience to false orders should be immediately arrested and executed. The two admirals expressed their gratitude for Heaven's protection of the Leader and their hatred for the rebels. Dönitz also said that the assassination of the Leader would hand the German people over to the enemy.</p>
<p>Heaven's Blessing, National Joy</p>
<p>Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency) – Reuter reports: After the people of Germany heard the news yesterday that the assassination attempt on Hitler had failed, they were deeply relieved and joyful. Apart from revealing that the weapon used was a bomb, no other details of the crime were announced, and it is expected that the police will not release any information until the preliminary investigation is complete. It is recalled that when the German Leader was first assassinated on November 8, 1939, in a beer hall in Munich, the details of the case were not revealed until thirteen days after the incident. The German Leader was assassinated again yesterday, and fortunately, he was not seriously injured. All sides believe that this was a blessing from Heaven. German Deputy Intelligence Chief Sontheimer said: "Germany's enemies attempted to assassinate Leader Hitler, and they are once again using criminal means to assist the progress of the war, but Heaven's decision has backfired. The failure of this assassination attempt on the German Leader proves that the Leader will complete his mission under the protection of Heaven."</p>

<h3>British Advance South in the Caen Area Meets Strong Resistance - American Forces Launch Offensive Towards La Haye</h3>
<p>Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency) – The German News Agency reports: The major battle east of the Orne River continued on Wednesday, with undiminished intensity. Due to the heavy losses suffered by the British Second Army, the British High Command had to urgently transfer reserves from the rear to reorganize and replenish its battered formations, but even these reinforcements could not achieve victory. British and Canadian units launched new offensives along a broad front from the areas of Colombelles, Douvres-la-Délivrande, and Sannerville, but were stopped after advancing less than two kilometers. The localities of Hérouvillette, Franqueville, Cuverville, and Bourguébus in this area were reported lost. At the same time, British troops advancing from Caen reached Hill 67 north of St. André, as well as Ifs and Hubert-Folie. British tank units attacking Troarn were driven back to their original positions. There were no reports of significant changes southwest of Caen. In the Caumont area, American artillery heavily bombarded the new German positions there on Wednesday and Thursday mornings. West of the Vire River, German forces repelled all American attacks, and a gap in the German line was closed during a counterattack. American forces between the Vire and Drôme rivers attempted to dislodge German forces from the high ground, but all their attacks were unsuccessful. The enemy's reckless advance on the Losque-Mesnil-Véneron road also failed. On Thursday morning, American forces launched a new offensive towards the La Haye area, but details are not yet known.</p>
<p>Invasion Force of Forty Divisions</p>
<p>The British and American forces currently stationed on the narrow Normandy landing beach number forty divisions, at least half of which are engaged in the current offensive. In addition, there are many artillery units, engineer units, and other special units in the landing area. Despite this concentration of powerful forces and materiel, General Montgomery has ultimately failed to expand his operational area. The depth of the British and American landing area does not exceed twenty kilometers at any point.</p>
<h3>British Casualty Statistics from Flying Bomb Attacks</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency) – According to a London dispatch: The British Home Office has recently announced that in June, the number of British citizens killed in air raids totaled 1,935, including confirmed deaths and those missing, including 716 men, 988 women, and 231 children. The number of wounded and hospitalized totaled 5,906, including 2,151 men, 3,262 women, and 493 children. Most of these deaths and injuries were caused by flying bombs during the half-month period of attacks. The number of deaths in July totaled 68, including 26 men, 32 women, and 10 children. The number of wounded was 75, including 36 men, 38 women, and 1 child. The difference between the two months is significant, demonstrating the enormous power of flying bombs.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 21st (Central News Agency) – Reuter reports: British Minister of Public Health Willink stated in the House of Commons yesterday that 170,000 women and children have been evacuated from London since July 2nd. Home Secretary Morrison informed the House of Commons that he will report on the new warning system for defending against flying bombs next week.</p>
<h3>Soviet Forces Launch Full-Scale Offensive on the Central Sector of the Eastern Front - The Battle for Lviv is Particularly Intense</h3>
<p>Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency) – The German News Agency reports: In the past two days, the fighting in the central and southern sectors of the Eastern Front has expanded to the north. Soviet forces are hindering German operations, and fierce fighting is currently underway on that front. From Lviv (i.e., Lemberg) in the south to south of Pskov in the north, there has been continuous fighting throughout the day, with the focus currently being northeast of Lviv, west of Kovel, northwest of Velikiye Luki, south of Tver, and in the Opochka area. In the southern sector, German forces west of Brody engaged in fierce battles with powerful Soviet tank and sniper divisions. Although Soviet forces west of Kovel attempted to pursue the German forces with the upper reaches of the Bug River as their target, the German forces safely crossed the Bug River. Soviet forces have now begun a large-scale offensive in an attempt to cross the Neman River. Soviet forces have now reached the west bank of the Neman River, and fierce fighting is underway in two locations. After several hours of fighting, the Soviet forces were repelled. The focus of the fighting in the northern sector of the Eastern Front is the Opochka area. Soviet forces broke through the German lines in several places, but the breakthroughs were blocked by German counterattacks from the flanks.</p>
<h3>Record of the Battle of the Mariana Sea - A New Form of Modern Naval Warfare</h3>
<p>In the battle between the Japanese and US fleets in the waters west of the Mariana Islands, the Japanese side adopted a flexible and adaptive stance, launching a preemptive attack on the enemy's incoming forces, and achieving a great victory by sinking five aircraft carriers and at least one battleship. However, the enemy's remaining forces still number considerably.</p>
<p>The enemy, taking a stand on Koror, where they could freely choose their targets, attacked the Mariana Islands on June 11th, planning to destroy the air bases first to make them unusable. The enemy aircraft's continuous bombing and the naval guns' bombardment from surface warships continued day and night, inevitably causing considerable damage to the bases. The enemy's carrier groups were of the Essex-class (26,000 tons) and converted special carriers from Copan and other heavy cruisers. The battleships in the escort fleet were the newly-built 45,000-ton Iowa-class and the 35,000-ton South Dakota-class, etc. They also used a considerable number of destroyers for transport, seemingly using their speed to achieve high-speed transport.</p>
<p>Japanese Carrier Aircraft Preemptively Attack</p>
<p>After landing on Saipan Island on the 15th, they reinforced with additional aircraft carriers and replenished their aircraft in order to expand their landing area. At this time, the base garrison resolutely defended its positions, and the land artillery shelled the enemy battleships, hitting the turret at the stern of a ship, causing a major fire, or submarines sank the enemy's new-type battleships. The base air force's new bomber aircraft also seriously damaged at least three enemy aircraft carriers, causing them to catch fire.</p>
<p>By the 18th, the enemy seemed to be secretly expanding their search line against a portion of our Combined Fleet. However, they ultimately failed to discover it. On the morning of the 19th, they were subjected to a preemptive attack by our mother ship's aircraft.</p>
<p>A battle between large fleets requires unimaginable preparation and enormous supplies. The reporter is thoroughly familiar with and amazed by the thoroughness and meticulousness of our operations. The timing of the battle was subtle and completely unpredictable. Behind that firm grasp of the opportunity for a preemptive strike was the great merit of our search aircraft (including carrier-based seaplane reconnaissance aircraft).</p>
<p>Recently, the enemy's mobile task force has combined aircraft carriers and new-type battleships, using the battleship's powerful anti-aircraft firepower to compensate for the carrier's weaknesses. Many cruisers and destroyers are arranged around its outer perimeter, and the wheel-shaped formation tends to expand. This large wheel-shaped formation maintains organic contact with other carrier groups, and with the development of radar and other detection devices, surprise attacks are completely impossible. Our attack aircraft squadron sacrificed fifty aircraft to break through this wheel-shaped formation and attack the enemy carrier in the face of anti-aircraft fire, which shows how difficult the task was.</p>
<p>Close-Quarters Night Attack Ultimately Not Realized</p>
<p>On the other hand, repeated attempts at close-quarters night attacks, taking advantage of the convenience of a preemptive strike, were ultimately not realized. A gun battle with surface warships, which would have been absolutely advantageous to us, never occurred, because the performance of carrier-based aircraft has improved, increasing their speed and enabling long-range air strikes, and because the enemy's escape was extremely rapid. Moreover, the moonlight at the time was dim, and the enemy's mobile task force continued to move at high speed, making the search work unprecedentedly difficult.</p>
<p>Eighty Percent of Attacking Enemy Aircraft Shot Down</p>
<p>Speaking of aircraft, the Japanese carrier-based aircraft squadrons are absolutely superior, repeatedly attacking with giant bombs in dive bombing and torpedo attacks. The enemy's counterattack consisted of only one wave of dive bombers and torpedo bombers, and the enemy's dive bomber techniques were extremely crude, dropping many small bombs in the hope of hitting something. Under these absolute conditions, the fact that the fleet was able to remain intact, and that there were surviving enemy forces, was entirely due to the long-range nature of the battle on the open ocean. The difference lay in the "number" of enemy carrier groups arriving in succession and the "quantity" of supplies. The enemy's base attacks were extremely crude and cowardly, strafing from an altitude of 1,000 meters. Of the fifty attacking enemy aircraft, forty were shot down in one fell swoop. The pilots' technical skills were immature, and they only relied on randomly dropping timed bombs and cluster bombs in an attempt to achieve some effect. Because these base attacks continued without interruption, the activity of our base air force was significantly hampered.</p>
<p>The overall results of the battle since the enemy's attack on the Mariana Islands have been enormous in terms of warships sunk and damaged, and aircraft shot down. However, it cannot be said that a decisive blow has been dealt to the enemy's numbers, and our side can only use "quantity" to counter the "quantity" of the attack.</p>
<p>Not only the quantity of aircraft, but also surface warships, supply ships, all require "quantity", and the rapid preparation and repair of bases also require the utmost mobilization of mechanical power and resources. This depends solely on a dramatic increase in combat power in all areas. (Shō: Translated from the Asahi Shimbun, July 8th)</p>

<h3>Department Head Matsushima Elaborates: Significance of the New Cabinet's Formation and Reports on the Pacific War Situation</h3>
<p>Department Head Matsushima of the Allied Japan Naval Fleet Press Department stationed in China, met with the local Chinese press corps yesterday (the 22nd) afternoon at his department as a routine meeting. He elaborated in detail on the formation of the new Japanese cabinet, the recent situation in the Central Pacific, etc. A record of his speech is as follows:</p>
<p>New Cabinet Formed to Strive for Victory</p>
<p>Now is a time when the situation is becoming increasingly critical. As the new cabinet has been formed by command, I, as a Japanese military man, am not allowed to criticize politics. However, my views on this matter are the same as those published by the Cabinet Information Bureau: "It is not related in the slightest to Saipan Island, and it will never take the battle situation there as a standard, but is an adjustment of the political system to strive for final victory." There is no need for me to elaborate on other aspects, but I firmly believe that the Saipan battle has given the entire Japanese nation a great awakening and further promoted a surge of enthusiasm. Since the last change of Naval Minister, the enemy has made the following arguments, such as claiming it was due to the defeat in the Mariana Islands operation, etc., attempting to confuse the public. In fact, the reason is definitely not this. The change of Naval Minister is determined by the overall war situation. I can further explain to you that this is not only not a sign of Japan being unable to continue, but rather a task to open up the entire war situation in the future.</p>
<p>Saipan Has No Economic Value</p>
<p>Next, regarding the recent situation in the Central Pacific, Department Head Matsushima elaborated as follows: Recently, some enemy submarines near Saipan have occasionally moved toward Omiya Island and small islands, carrying out bombing several times. We regard the area near the Mariana Islands as a "pig farm," meaning "slaughtering them after they are fattened." As for Saipan Island, economically speaking, it has little value other than producing a very small amount of sugar. In military terms, although there are some locations that can be used as airfields, it is absolutely impossible to use them for naval fleets to moor. Therefore, we firmly believe that the enemy will definitely shift its main force in the future to try to seize Truk Island, because that place can be used as a naval base. Therefore, if the enemy continues to fight in a "not defeated posture" and invades Truk, it is inevitable. Otherwise, it will take a considerable amount of time for the enemy to advance westward. Now, looking at the heroic demeanor of Grand Admiral Minei when he was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Fleet, we feel more confident. The "Fudōkyō" [Immovable Scripture] has the phrase "The heart dwells in immovability," and we firmly believe that Grand Admiral Minei's heart is in the same state. Regarding this matter and the recent impact on Japanese residents in Shanghai, it can be said that the people's spirit is extremely high. On the 20th of this month alone, the Naval Attaché's Office received more than 7.6 million yuan in donations from the people, which can purchase more than ten aircraft.</p>
<p>Significant American Losses on Saipan</p>
<p>Regarding the Saipan Island operation, American Pacific Fleet Commander-in-Chief Nimitz called it the biggest loss in American history. From June 11th to July 16th, the losses suffered by the fleet near Saipan accounted for 50% of all battleships, 60% of aircraft carriers, and 87% of aircraft. On June 19th, Nimitz broadcast on Honolulu that "the entire Japanese fleet has been annihilated," but in a broadcast on the 18th of this month, he announced to the country that "the aircraft of the Japanese fleet are still intact, and the American people must work harder to increase production." Making contradictory remarks on the same radio station in less than a month reveals the inaccuracy of enemy American announcements. At the same time, Nimitz further stated, "Although Saipan has been captured, the progress of the war in the future will be more difficult." Based on his so-called words, we can imagine the general losses suffered by the enemy Americans near Saipan. According to a broadcast from Chongqing on the 20th of this month, the American troops in Burma collected Japanese national flags to commemorate their operations. Its use is nothing more than preparing to use them as cover when attacked by the Japanese army, or when surrendering to Japan.</p>
<p>Failed Plot to Assassinate German Leader</p>
<p>Reuters reported from London this month that "the plot to assassinate German leader Hitler failed. Herr Hitler, after suffering only minor burns, met with Mussolini." This reminds us of Christ being betrayed by his disciple Judas, Confucius going to Song to lecture on rites and music under a tree when Huan attacked and felled trees to harm Confucius, and Shakyamuni people being jealous of his name and wanting to harm him. Although we cannot know the purpose of the plan to assassinate Hitler, we must know that after every great man, there must be the actions of ordinary people and villains. If the assassination of Herr Hitler is made into a drama, it will be even more interesting. If historians continue to this point in a hundred years, what will they think? It will be said: "For true righteousness, we should fight to the end."</p>
<p>Unity Between Chinese and Japanese Military and Civilians in Hankou</p>
<p>Finally, Department Head Matsushima also said that according to the Naval Attaché who recently came to Shanghai from Hankou, American planes recently bombed Hankou day and night. The spirit of unity between the Chinese and Japanese military and civilians in Hankou was fully demonstrated. At that time, I questioned that if American planes bombed Hankou, the Chinese people would definitely say that because the Japanese were in Hankou, the American planes came to attack, causing the Chinese people to suffer losses. But the answer was the opposite. It was said that "under the tragic circumstances, the Chinese and Japanese people have truly demonstrated the spirit of living and dying together." Recently, the Chinese side has been extremely enthusiastic about the aircraft donation campaign. Hankou City can donate as many as three aircraft in a month. I am very grateful after hearing this. Although we have had many problems in the past, it is better to talk about the present than the past. How should we eliminate Britain and the United States?</p>
<h3>Today a Century Ago: Founder of German Trading Company, Melchers &amp; Co., Recalls His First Visit to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The 10th of July, a century ago, was the date when Mr. R. von Carlowitz, the founder of the German trading company Melchers &amp; Co., first visited Shanghai. Mr. Carlowitz embarked on a ship from Bremen, Germany, on November 2nd of the 24th year of Daoguang in the Qing Dynasty. The ships were named "Anna" and "Aretsai," sailing ships of a German expedition team. They arrived in Singapore on March 29th of the following year, stayed for a month, set up a sales office, and then chartered a brig named "Henggeer" to Macau. They arrived in Zhoushan and Ningbo from Macau on June 21st of the same year. Mr. Carlowitz contacted local Chinese businessmen in Ningbo and conducted business smoothly. The process and impressions gained from visiting Putuo and other famous places were very beautiful. He described them in detail in his family letters, praising them to the extreme, which made the listeners fascinated. He left Ningbo on July 8th, and on the 10th, he brought the remaining goods he sold and arrived in Shanghai. This was the first time that the person who built the eastern route for German merchants visited Shanghai. At that time, Shanghai had been opened as a trading port by the Treaty of Nanjing several years earlier by R. von Carlowitz. Merchants from various countries gathered to develop their country's commerce in China. Mr. Carlowitz stayed in Shanghai for a week, examining the local customs, and merchants' needs in detail. Afterwards, he went to Zhoushan again on August 1st, passed through Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and the commercial areas of India and Java before returning to his country. As a result, he gained more experience and understood the situation clearly. He concluded that if he wanted to develop commerce in China, he should first establish a trading company in Guangzhou. From there, he could extend it to all parts of the country. He presented his suggestion to the organizers of the German expedition, namely the giant merchants C. Hirzel &amp; Co., Carl and Gustao Harkort, from the city of Leipzig. He won unanimous support. The companies widely issued announcements for him on October 31st, 1845, expressing their willingness to provide strong support for Mr. Carlowitz's new business. So on January 1st, 1846, Mr. Carlowitz and Mr. Hart officially announced the establishment of the German trading company Melchers &amp; Co. in Guangzhou and started business. Later, the business became increasingly developed. Up to now, all well-known cities in China have branches of Melchers &amp; Co., with a grand scale. People regard it as the leader of German merchants, but tracing the origin, all of it is due to Mr. Carlowitz's long-term vision and the hard work of creating it a century ago.</p>

<h3>How Should Jiaotong University Charge Tuition Fees?</h3>
<p>— Xiang Jun</p>
<p>The university entrance exam has not yet finished, and there is already a stir among the students, "Tuition fees are going to increase." But everyone still has a bit of joking and humorous tone, so the situation is naturally not very serious. Obviously, everyone seems a bit "indifferent," but to say that this "indifference" is a negligence of us university students is not necessarily the case. Some people say that engineering students are good at analyzing things, and we will indeed use common sense to speculate and conclude that there will definitely not be any drastic changes. There are ten reasons:</p>
<p>The original tuition fee was only ten yuan. Even if it increased a hundredfold, it would only be a thousand yuan, but there is absolutely no reason to suddenly increase a hundredfold. After the war, various colleges and universities usually have loans and grants to help students in war zones and maintain wartime education. Now it is cancelled, but it will not reverse the situation and increase tuition fees. The government's annual income is not known to us, but it has obviously increased in recent years. In addition, there are always special funds for education expenditures, so it is not necessary to increase tuition fees. The prices are soaring, and the lives of professors are difficult - not only difficult, but simply impossible to live on, which is indeed the case. However, considering the arduous responsibilities and important missions they bear for the country, the government should be responsible for providing relief and solutions. Wartime education should adapt to the wartime environment and cultivate specialized talents, which is the most urgent of the urgent tasks. University students receive special education and can contribute to society and benefit the people. If they are allowed to drop out of school, all previous efforts will be wasted, which is definitely not what a wise government would like to do. The strength of a country depends on education. The lack of universal and developed education in our country is almost the best in the world. University education is especially pitifully young. Even if we don't think about improving and expanding it now, we should try our best to maintain the existing rigorousness. Increasing tuition fees and increasing the burden on students is not ideal. The government's prestige is the foundation of the country. The living needs of professors in national colleges and universities must also be sought from the students, which has a profound impact on the national psychology. The solution to the problem is to treat the root cause rather than the symptoms. The lives of professors are one part of the lives of the national people, so a comprehensive solution should be given to thoroughly solve it. Saving the professors and hurting the students is like cutting flesh to heal sores, how is that a solution? As for Jiaotong University, it has its own glorious history and lofty status, which we cannot fully express. The talents of all the professors are outstanding, and their spirit of burying their heads in hard work is especially commendable. In terms of meritorious service, the government should especially favor them and find extra ways for them. Most of the students at Jiaotong University are poor, which is obvious to all, but their spirit of hard study has not been weakened. The government will definitely give special consideration and will not deepen their pain.</p>
<p>Various factors, but I don't think there will be any serious difficulties imposed on us. But according to news from well-informed sources, the tuition fee for the next semester will be 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. After listening to it, I can't help but be shocked and a little panicked. This amount is not huge at present, but it is not known that the hardworking students have empty pockets, and it is already difficult to handle books and stationery. In a situation where "money is not needed unless there is something," food and accommodation have long become a problem. To increase this huge expenditure out of thin air, it is not difficult to imagine the situation, although it is understandable.</p>
<p>At this time of decisive battle, it is the responsibility of the people to help each other in the same boat. We are extremely considerate of the government's difficulties and are unwilling to make any harsh demands or extravagant hopes. However, the lives of poor professors must be resolved, and the burden of hardworking students must not be increased. I hope the government will carefully handle things and give a satisfactory solution.</p>
<p>The fee increase is so huge, I hope it is not true. Unfortunately, it has been decided by the authorities, so I only hope to make changes again. People in society should not sit idly by, and we are waiting for the help of sympathizers.</p>
<h3>Public Works Bureau's Reply on Preventing Accidents on Shangchuan Road</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Public Works Bureau sent a letter yesterday saying: "I read Mr. Cheng Yingming's article 'Suggestions to the Public Works Bureau to Prevent Accidents on Shangchuan Railway' in the National Forum of your newspaper on the 15th. The damage to Shangchuan Road, the difficulty of driving, and the difficulty of management are concise and appropriate, and the two suggestions are also unquestionable. I deeply admire him. In order to prevent accidents, this office has been trying its best to reduce the load of vehicles. It would rather sacrifice income and refuse to transport large quantities of goods, especially salt. In recent months, train derailment incidents have not occurred, and it has achieved practical results. On the one hand, we are trying our best to raise funds to purchase sleepers for local repairs and to ensure traffic safety. Mr. Cheng's proposal to purchase trees from the people on the spot was drafted by this office in March this year and submitted to the city government for approval. Later, due to the complexity of the procedures and the difficulty in ensuring fair prices for the purchase, and later because the city government considered that too many trees had been felled by the people, it expressly prohibited it. This office had to suspend the plan and commission merchants to purchase 5,000 sleepers from eastern Zhejiang. On May 17 this year, a contract was signed. Now the sleepers have been concentrated in Ningbo, waiting for shipment to Shanghai. In the shortest possible time, we can choose the best ones to replace and repair the road surface. In the current wartime when materials are scarce and it is difficult to purchase, even if there is no problem with financial resources, it is difficult to achieve the construction goals of peacetime. Therefore, there is no need to issue public bonds or add surcharges to tickets to raise funds at present. Shanghai Special City Public Works Bureau, Shangchuan and Shangnan Roads Management Office."</p>
<h3>Citizen Consumer Cooperative's Reply</h3>
<p>The Citizen Consumer Cooperative sent a letter saying: "I read the article 'When Can the Citizen Consumer Cooperative Distribute Goods?' in the National Forum of your newspaper on the 20th of this month. I have to state a thing or two to clarify the truth. When the cooperative was established in June last year, it originally planned to contact various industry federations to obtain a large number of allocated materials in order to solve the pressure of citizens' lives. Unexpectedly, after its establishment, the environment became more and more difficult, and the industry federations were unable to take care of themselves, and it was impossible to obtain materials. This is a common fact. Therefore, the cooperative can only purchase on the black market and distribute it on the black market. After trying it three times, it was finally felt that it could not be satisfactory. In November last year, when materials were even more scarce, the second meeting of the directors and supervisors was held, and it was decided to distribute the remaining materials as much as possible to the members, recover the cooperative certificates, and seek to end the cooperative. When this news was announced in the newspapers, and the members were notified in the files, a part of the members did not come to the cooperative to receive the allocated materials, nor did they come to the cooperative to go through the withdrawal procedures, so the cooperative could not be ended. In order to save expenses, the scope had to be reduced. However, the cooperative will never harm the interests of its members in any way. It is now preparing for the last distribution to end the cooperative. When the date is set, it will be announced. Shanghai Citizen Consumer Cooperative."</p>

<h3>Members of Huai'en Church Establish Educational Grants</h3>
<p>Hoping that all churches will start advocating</p>
<p>Recently, five enthusiastic church members of Huai'en Church in Menlu, in view of the soaring prices and the steep increase in tuition and miscellaneous fees of various schools, most parents are unable to bear the burden, and young children are inevitably suffering from dropping out of school. Shen Xin Two Newspapers have been handling student aid funds for many years with remarkable results. Although they have loudly called for donations from all parties, there are still more monks than porridge, and there are inevitably pearls left in the sea. Some fellow villagers' associations and charities occasionally respond to the call, but their strength is limited, and how can they provide assistance to thousands of poor students? After consulting with the Deacon Board of the church, the Huai'en Church Education Group was formally established, with the purpose of raising educational grants to help poor church members' children go to school. It is reported that the group has now raised 100,000 yuan, and will make every effort to raise more funds. It is hoped that enthusiastic church members and people from all walks of life will embrace the heart of helping the hungry and drowning, and promote the righteousness of helping others as they would themselves, and donate as much as they can to jointly support this righteous cause.</p>
<p>As for the scope of assistance, due to funding reasons, it is temporarily limited to the children of church members. However, if the results are good and a large sum of money is collected, it will be extended to the children of poor church members in other churches. As the autumn school season is approaching, the responsible personnel of the group are working hard every day to actively handle the matter. Now the first application form and registration form have been compiled and printed. All church members who are poor and whose children cannot afford to go to school can go to the Education Group of the church to apply from now on. Also, the colleagues of the group feel that the loss of young people dropping out of school is a great loss to the country and society. They earnestly hope that enthusiastic church members in this city will uphold the purpose of student aid and advocate for it in groups. Then the children of poor church members will all be able to continue to attend school and will not wander astray. Their merits are truly indescribable.</p>
<h3>Student Aid News</h3>
<p>Mr. Tang Weizhi and others from Taicang County have initiated a university loan for poor children in Taicang County. Since its implementation, donations from all walks of life have been very enthusiastic. In the second half of this year, six university students are approved. All poor university students from Taicang County can apply for registration to Mr. Lu Boquan at 7 Xinkaihe, Taicang City, or Mr. Gu Zhongchao at 14 Puja Lane, Taicang City.</p>
<p>Taizhou Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai</p>
<p>In view of the increase in tuition fees in various schools, there will inevitably be more young people dropping out of school. In order to rescue them, we are gathering the strength of fellow villagers to promote the student loan movement. We have now raised 10,000 yuan. Also, the third membership recruitment movement of the association is very enthusiastic, and the results of the second recruitment will be announced on August 15.</p>
<h3>Donate Small Loan Fund</h3>
<p>The small loan fund is the service of this office six. All those who run a small business and feel short of capital can apply for registration to this office. Repay the principal once a month, in ten installments, without interest.</p>
<p>Donating a small loan fund can give poor people the opportunity to make a living, and it implies the ultimate meaning of helping the unemployed.</p>
<h3>Are There Any Flexible Measures for Reporting and Cancelling Household Registration When Returning to Hometown?</h3>
<p>My friend Mr. Zhang returned to his hometown two months ago because his father was ill. Now he has received a letter saying that his father has passed away, and there is no one to take care of his family, so he cannot come to Shanghai. He sent back his Shanghai citizen certificate and entrusted it to the Baojia Office to cancel it on his behalf. After submitting it to the Baojia Office for cancellation, it was said that he must return it in person and cannot be represented. However, now that transportation is inconvenient and the travel expenses are huge, I am still entrusted to inquire by letter. I don't know if the Baojia authorities can understand the people's difficulties and provide flexible measures for this type of situation. (Sincerely, 　Zhen)</p>

<h3>Navy</h3>
<p>— Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Yang</p>
<p>Blood and Tears (1)</p>
<p>The car sped along the path below the cliff, arriving at the school gate in the blink of an eye. At the gate, Masato paid the fare.</p>
<p>Upon entering the gate, the fine gravel path was very clean, with a garden-style arrangement in the middle, with stones and blooming azaleas. On the central platform, two small submarines were displayed, remnants of the era known as the submersible boat era. In front of one with the number "Six" written in white letters, a small shrine was enshrined. This was the Submarine Shrine.</p>
<p>Masato stood in front of the shrine, respectfully bowing and saying:</p>
<p>"This is Lieutenant Sakuma's No. 6 boat. This shrine is dedicated to all those who sacrificed themselves for the country. These martyrs are more like the guardian deities of the Imperial submarine, rather than just the guardian deities of the submarine school... Wait here for a moment. I'll go get Nitta."</p>
<p>Having said that, he ran into the building directly ahead.</p>
<p>Takao also knew about Lieutenant Sakuma's heroic martyrdom, so he secretly paid his respects in his heart, and then carefully observed this leaf-shaped No. 6 boat. Because Takao had read naval literature, he understood whether the early submersibles were Dutch-type or single-hull type. Soon after, that person appeared, dragging Lieutenant Nitta along.</p>
<p>"Takao, you're really lucky. The dean is still here on Sunday and will come to see you in a while. This is because Nitta introduced you to him, saying you are a naval painter."</p>
<p>Masato was very happy, as if it were his own affair. Takao also thanked Lieutenant Nitta.</p>
<p>"Don't mention it. Well, let me lead you on a tour of the school buildings! Today is a day off, there are no classes..."</p>
<p>The lieutenant said, waddling forward with his large buttocks.</p>
<p>The workshops were built separately and were located everywhere. There were various workshops for steering, machinery, torpedoes, etc., but since it was a day off, they were all locked, so we could only stand outside the windows and take a look.</p>
<p>"You'll see the real thing in the future, so this is enough for now."</p>
<p>Later, Lieutenant Nitta led them to the school building. That was where the trainees lived and studied academic subjects, but most of them had left the school on Sunday, so it seemed particularly quiet now.</p>
<p>In a moment, they ran to the trainees' dormitory. There were several large pillars supporting the building, with many long tables and benches arranged below. Furthermore, the rifle racks and shoe racks were all neatly arranged, but they were all placed very close together.</p>
<p>"The Imperial Navy doesn't pay much attention to dormitories, especially in submarines. But the trainees' dormitory also imitates this point, so this room serves as a dormitory, dining hall, and study. Look, there are hooks hanging on the beams! They put up a rope frame and sleep on it... (12.1)"</p>
