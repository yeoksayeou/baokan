<h3>社評　教育界應有之反省</h3>
<p>光陰荏苒，本學年又屆結束。雖然寒來暑往，歲月不居，若能把握現實充分利用，崗位工作努力推進，則一月有一月之成績，一歲有一歲之功效。如虛度牝擲一無成就，甚或在目前可實貴之時間中，撒下將來惡果之種子，則豈徒辜負大好時光，抑且爲後世子孫之罪人。是以可懼者在此而不在彼，况敎育事業之本身正具有程先啟後之功能，其責任之重，影響之遠，尤非其他事業所可比倫，爰在學年結束之時，敦促敎育界全體各自作一番深切之反省。</p>
<p>敎育當局　國家之所以設敎育主管機關者，非所以安插冗員聯備一格，良以敎育須有政策，須有制度，須有目標，不容散處各地之各校各自爲政，因而設有機構專司統籌之職。試反省一年之中：是否已確定適應目前針對將來之敎育原則；是否按此原則逐步推行；是否各學校能禀承此旨實地推進；是否對於目前學校與學生所感覺之困難事實，籌擬具體解決方案，如戰時敎育問題，敎職員生活問題，學生學費問題；是否各學校之敎學程度及畢業水準與所規定相符。凡此種種反省之答案，不特足以判巳往之功過，亦即爲下學年工作內容及進度之張本。</p>
<p>當局　學校固有公立私立之分，但主持校務者之責任，則無非奉行敎育主管機關之法令，而直接發揮學校之功能。一方面對政府負責，一方面督導師生。試反省一年之中：是否無愧於國家，無負於學生；是否以辦理學校之精神辦理學校，而不染市儈謀利之氣味；是否能取之於政府，或取之於學生者，皆用之於學校；是否在可能範圍之內將學校之精神（訓育方面）及物質（設備方面）上，均加以改進與補充；是否已竭其所能，使敎員安心於授課，而所選聘之師資，確乎在品學上足爲師表；是否已洞悉學生內心之苦悶，而予以合理之解說；是否覺察到學生心理上之危機，而予以有效之糾正；是否能採取公開之態度，接受校內校外之批評與指摘。凡此種種反省之答案，必各各不同，如自認有缺陷之處，務須衝破難關達成日的，怨天尤人，非直接負敎育使命之學校當局所應出此。</p>
<p>各級敎師（甲）小學敎師所應反省者：是否明瞭小學生之心理及生理；是否注意小學生之課業與健康之配合；是否察冀小學生時代足以影響其一生之微言微行，而予以正當之啓導；是否東西各小學生之個性，而於一班施敎之外予以個別指導。（乙）中學敎師所應反省者：是否本身對於所授之科目澈底明瞭而純熟；是否對於講授之方法隨時加以研究改進，以期能引起學生之與趣；是否對於紀律訓練隨時隨地加以注意，而本身確有律已之修養；是否在「學以理明」本原則下，隨時隨地灌輸思想上及操行上之要素，是否顧到戰時敎育之使命。（丙）大學敎師所應反省者：是否本身學力與品格承當「敎授」名義而無愧；是否本身對於學問有研究之門徑與興趣，而足以引起學生之風從；是否能在專門學術或技能上有所貢獻，並顧到戰時敎育之使命，以增進中國大學在國際上之地位；是否能在文化事業上建立一些基礎而爲後輩努力之階梯。凡此種種之答案叉必各各不同，但無論如何須求良心上之所安，自問不適於任教師者，理應改就他業，而免誤已誤人。至若目前生活之艱苦，未得各自發揚其本身之能力，未始不言之成理，果有過人之學識與人格，則環境愈惡劣愈易收感召之效力。</p>
<p>各級學生　年齡幼稚之小學生尙不足以與言反省，而中學以上之學生不應依然渾渾噩噩不識不知。試反省一年之中：是否埋頭窗下，而與「學生」頭銜名符其實；是否因求知而入學；是否能充分承受師傳，而充分利用設備；是否能消化所習之課本，而致於活用；是否能藉已有之基礎，而自動進展；是否瞭解戰時環境，而努力於學行之砥勵；是否所選擇之科目舉本身天賦相近，而感覺趣；是否已立定志向，而具有修道苦行之精神。凡此種種反省之答案，可使人寒流浹背，亦可使人怨憤塡膺，欲求推諉何患無辭。然靑可藤籃，弟子不必不如師長，點石成金，有志者不患無成。負薪掛角，萃爲大儒，校僕小工，可成宗師，而衣冠楚楚，名鬥後裔，終於不　不莠，其將何以自圓其說？</p>
<p>此外，更須綜合上述各方面反省之結果，聯合社會上真正有心之士，共加探討，集羣力而耕耘敎育之田，則所得之收穫庶可有明年勝此年之望。往者巳矣，來者可進，若長此蹉跎，必俟其敎育全部破產而謀匡復，則事倍功半或竟不可能！敎育界以及社會人士當愚不致此，願早加反省而亟起圖之！</p>
<p>塞班島西方海面日機隊果敢作戰硫磺島東南敵機受重創</p>
<p>東京二十五日中央社電　據中部太平洋日軍某基地電，塞班島方面之日機，爲協力於陸地作戰之日軍，二十四日夜曾轟炸該島西南方之敵陣地，並猛攻敵登陸地點及其舟艇羣。</p>
<p>太平洋日軍某基地二十五日中央社電　日軍航空部隊，二十五日黎明於塞班島西方海面，發現一萬噸級之敵軍大型運輪船一艘，常對之猛攻，將其擊沉。二十四日夜，更對敵軍陣地作果敢轟炸，投彈悉中目標。</p>
<p>中部太平洋日軍基地二十五日中央社電　日機隊二十四日上午曾在硫磺島東南方海面邀擊敵機動部隊，反覆施以雷擊轟炸，卒擊毀敵航空母艦二艘，刻仍繼續攻擊中，預料該方面之戰果將更見擴大。</p>
<p>中部太平洋日軍某基地二十五日中央社電　小笠原羣島之硫磺島方面，二十四日晨間有敵艦載轟炸機戰鬥機約六十餘架來襲，爲日戰鬥機隊擊落三十七架以上。</p>
<h3>東亞一週間戰况</h3>
<p>— （續完）</p>
<p>十七日，敵軍得後續部隊之增援及航空部隊之掩護，進出於阿斯利特飛機塲，迭尼安日軍，隔塞班海峽猛加反擎，砲火甚爲熾烈。十九日，日軍聯合艦隊之一部，在馬利亞納羣島西方海面，將敵之羣機動部隊加以先制攻擊，至二十日擊沉繫傷之敵艦，計航空母艦五艘，戰艦一艘，擊落機百架以上，日方有航艦一艘及油槽船二艘沉沒，喪失飛機五十架。塞班島自出現敵軍以來，經日軍連日攻擎，十二日至二十日間，除日軍聯合艦隊之一部在馬利亞納島西方海面所舉之戰果外，計擊沉敵戰艦一艘，巡洋艦二艘，騙逐艦一艘，潛水艇一艘，擊毀敵航空母艦四艘，戰船二艘，騙逐艦四艘，運輸船六艘及艦型不明者一艘。二十一日夜，日機猛炸塞班海峽之敵登陸地點，重創敵舟艇羣，日機已全部安返基地。當茲塞班島攻防戰熾烈之時，特魯克島十三日下午亦有敵B24型機二十一架來襲，十四日上午復有敵B24型機二十七架襲，當爲日軍擊落六架。　南太平洋必阿克島方面，敵正逐次增強兵力，擴張地盤，現有兵力爲一師半，該島南側之一機塲，似已入敵手，日軍與敵近相對峙，正繼續血戰中。迄十四日判明之戰果，計敵軍棄屍約千具，擊毀敵戰車十五輛，擊沉滿載兵員之舟艇九艘，鹵獲火砲二門，又敵似在登陸地點對岸渥伊島建築機塲中。（薩密方面）（特爾河河口），因日軍奮戰結果，於海岸附近，殆將敵軍繫潰，敵自五日左右增强兵力，日軍則繼攻擊特爾河左岸敵軍，同時，對特姆阿拉東方面敵軍，亦連日加以猛攻，使受重創，日軍從事防衛薩爾密，荷闌地亞，威瓦克附近海岸，以大砲及重火器，勇猛射擊，破壞敵魚雷艇之行動，已確保海岸附近之制海權。六月上旬，敵機來襲新幾內亞百二十二次，累計千三百六十五機，爲日軍擊落二十八架（內一架木證實），擊毀十架。（玻根維爾島），該方面日震於特洛基納附近敵橋頭堡周圍，以寡兵確保陣地，美軍約二百，曾於五·六兩日進攻泰實（特洛基納東北二十公里柯羅基左岸），已被日軍擊退，又一部有力敵軍，曾於三·四兩日，在塔貝拉（特洛基納東南二十五公里）登陸，日軍當將之擊潰。自三日至六日之戰果，計敵棄屍百九十一具，破壞迫擊砲二門，鹵獲輕重機槍九，步槍十七，敵魚雷艇二艘中彈起火，日方傷亡五名。拉巴爾十五·六兩日，曾有敵B24型機二十八架，B26型機三十一架，戰鬥機二十架，來襲馬諾卡利，爲日方擊落五架。　印度方面，二十日曾有敵戰鬥轟炸機三十五架，來襲安撻曼羣島布雷爾港，爲日軍擊落六架·擊毀四架，日軍僅有小艇一艘中彈起火。按是項敵機乃自敵機動部隊中飛來者，故極須警戒敵機動部隊之蠢動。　北方，六月十五日查，有敵機數機兩次來襲北千島，日機及高射砲隊擊洛敵機兩架，十七·十八·十九三日之夜間，曾有敵機數架來襲，然遭日防空陣營擊，未能達到目的，即行逃走，投彈均落海中，十四日，敵艦艇曾砲擊北千島，繼於十五日畫前來轟炸，料此或即中太平洋方面尼米資攻勢之牽制行動，然仍有嚴重警戒之必要。</p>
<h3>擊滅英美畫展　在京舉行</h3>
<p>南京二十五日中央社電　首都日本繪盡俱樂部，紫水舍主辦「擊滅英美獻機畫展」，於昨（二十五）日上午起，假大行宮森永茶室公開展覽。各家之傑作全部五十三輻中，計有油畫水彩風景素描等，備極精彩，參觀者甚爲踴躍。</p>
<h3>怒江西岸日軍　繼續進擊中</h3>
<p>仰光二十五日中央社電日軍對怒江西岸渝雲南遠征軍，仍繼續進繫中，十九日，渝軍曾來襲龍陵北側高地，經日軍反擊，渝軍棄屍二百以上，重機槍五，彈藥甚多而潰走，日軍刻正追擊其殘部。又于拉孟周圍欲行蠢動之渝軍，亦遭日軍擊潰，十八·十九兩日，渝軍棄屍可以百七十具，日軍鹵獲迫繫砲三，經機槍入。又來襲平台附近之渝軍，亦蒙重創而退，因此怒江之六萬渝軍，於開始反攻以來，僅月餘已頻于潰滅之狀態矣。</p>
<h3>湖南前綫　日军佔萍鄉　山岳地帶展開激戰</h3>
<p>湖南前綫廿五日中央社電　湖南前錢日軍，突破鄂贛省境之萬洋山山脈後，於廿二日晨以來，在萍鄕附近，與由第三戰區來犯之渝軍第廿六軍遭遇，遂展開激戰。至昨日下午三時，即將來犯之渝軍擎潰，而佔領萍鄕。緣第三戰區司令顧祝同，方接獲日軍突破省境之消息後，即飭令所轄第二十六軍，急赴萍鄕担任防務，以期確保該地之煤田。於是二十六軍長丁治盤，乃率四十四及四十一兩師，於廿一日傍晚，抵達英鄔附近，在該處已設立防衛陣地前面之山岳中，更構築野戰陣地據守，以謀阻止日軍之進擊。但卒因旦軍由三方面推進保衛作戰，及由背面突入渝軍陣地日軍之猛攻，遂吿敗退。已將萍鄕附近之煤田地帶佔領，並另以一部日軍更急追殘敗渝軍，目下在山岳地帶，展開殲滅戰中。</p>
<p>里期本廿五日中央社電　據重慶電，渝方廿四日發表湖南戰况如次：日軍自衡山迂迥前進，其中一部已進至衡陽東南，湘江沿岸地區戰事已更激烈。日軍刻已開始攻擊雷溪（據江東岸衡山南七公里）及呂集（衡山東南廿公里，）該方面今激戰中</p>
<h3>日機偵察衡陽機塲</h3>
<p>日軍某基地二十五日中央社電　日軍自攻陷長沙體陵後，曾重創薛岳所部渝直系軍，現仍繼續迅速進攻中。茲據渝方消息稱，衡陽乃華中方面渝美空軍前進基地，因畏日軍進攻，刻正疏散人口。並云將誓死準備防禦抵抗。但據日機偵察所知，渝美空軍早己聞聲遠揚，該機塲己不見渝機踪跡，整個機場，幾等於虛設。設備雖大致如舊，但其中一部似已被破壞，滑行路似正準備破壞。衡陽爲中國西南渝美兩空軍前進基地羣之中心，曾誇爲航空要塞，該地距桂林三百公里，其附近有體陵（西南百三十公里），賓慶（西南百公里），（川）東南二百公里）等靈要基地。但此次日軍進攻湖南，已對各該地予以重創，中國西南各基地，因遭日機制壓，故渝美空軍極感狼狽。於連結衡陽廣東之綫以東地域，有渝美空軍建設之對日攻擊第一綫基地遂川·建甌·韓州·等各地塲。同時更於遂川南方約百公里之山中新域附近，新築較遂川規模更大之機塲，以爲對日攻擊之池備，但渝軍此等部逞企圖，進遂全成泡影</p>
<h3>日科學家發明　飛機新製法　出產不久將翱翔天空</h3>
<p>東京二十五日中央社電　飛機增產，因航空戰之白熱化，亦隨而益趨樻極，同時爲代替南方礬土礦，故對日本國內輕金屬之生產，亦急需求增加。茲悉日本國產輕金工塲，對於輕金屬之特殊製法，已有新發明，此誠係旦本科學戰上之大戰果。按過去日本國曾經研究代巷南方礬土礦製作飛機用之輕金屬之製法，但尚未有良好之成績出現，今公學博士田中弘氏所發明之新製法，誠係世界科學陣營中最大成功。該新製法不但刻節省大量原土及材料，且其生產額亦較舊製法高出四倍，今該工塲已將自本年四月一日至九月三十日間，輕金屬增產期間所生產之一部粗製品，再度從事精製，故由此資料所製成純日本產飛機，不久即將翔翔於碧空矣。</p>
<h3>泰駐日大使館舉行慶祝會</h3>
<p>東京二十五日中央社電　泰駐日大使館以本月二十四日爲泰國國民紀念日，特於是日舉行盛大慶祝會。是日下午四時，泰國特命全權大使夫婦，曾親自邀請各國外交關係者蒞會，出席者有中國駐日大使蔡培氏，日靑木大東亞相，坪上大使夫婦，菲律賓代理大使拉繼得斯，緬甸大使載門暨西班牙公使，保加利亞公使等。會塲內並奏演泰國古典音榮，情緖極爲融洽。又日本重光外相夫婦，松平宮相及岡部文相夫婦，入田嘉明，前任欽相佐藤，軍務局長櫻川兵五郞氏等亦列席，當日來賓出席者計三百人，末由靑木大東亞相，泰國大使華德揚發起，共同祈祝軸心國之勝利，至六時許始散會。</p>
<h3>華萊士在渝會談告畢</h3>
<p>里斯本二十五日中央社電　據重慶電，美副大總統華萊士，自於本月二十日抵達重慶後，即與蔣介石氏以次渝方首腦進行會議。至二十四日會議已大致吿終。</p>
<h3>日琦玉小麥品種優良</h3>
<p>東京二十五日中央社電　據波和電稱：日本之琦玉小麥二十七號種子，自前年于南方各地試種以來，結果巴判明如于一定標高之地域種植，則其產量並不遜于日本內地，故各地皆紛紛來信，向琦玉縣定購此項品種，聞定量購己達一萬石。茲該縣府爲協力共榮圈之食糧增產，巴決定由目下之小麥精品中選出一千石（琦玉二十七號種子），決不劣于美澳之小麥種，且極適于在南方各地栽培，故相信將來出產量當遠駕澳洲小麥之上。</p>
<h3>土避免參戰</h3>
<p>布達佩斯二十五日中央社電據安加拉斯丹埠消息，傳土耳其政府要人，駐安加拉各國外交官及德大巴使本以次，均已中止赴斯丹埠避暑，安加拉政界頓形緊張。據現在土國軍部及政界當局推測，土耳其將依最少之犧牲，避免與三蘇三國決裂，而迴避參戰，</p>
<p>斯單埠二十五日中央社電海通社訊：此問正式公布，斯丹埠與特拉斯兩地所宣佈之戎嚴狀態，再予廷長六月。</p>
<h3>北法瑟堡要塞　展開市街戰　德防衛軍精銳奮抗中</h3>
<p>柏林二十五日中央社電　據北法前綫訊：瑟堡市街及防禦陣地之間，刻正展開激戰。</p>
<p>柏林二十五日中央社電　德軍當局二十四日公布，瑟堡大攻防戰，日下已達極點，美軍司令官勃拉德萊以步兵入師，機甲部隊二師，對瑟堡作總攻擊，敵砲兵隊及艦隊，亦不斷對德軍轟擊，其空軍亦時來轟炸德軍要塞之內部。陸上美軍更不顯切損失，三面夾攻，自南方及東南方來攻之敵軍，經激戰後，悉被擊潰，西南方來攻之美軍，則已突入要塞前方。</p>
<p>柏林二十五日中央社電　據德國新聞社訊：諾曼第方面除瑟堡戰綫外，反軸心軍僅於科倫比等地有局部之反攻，反軸心軍現正重整其殘部，柯坦汀半島之美軍拚死奪取瑟堡，但瑟堡要塞之德軍乃久經戰鬥之精銳，加之德軍復使港灣陷於不能使用之狀態，故美軍雖犧牲最大代價，仍不達其目的，刻美軍第四，第九，第十七，第九十師及戰車部險，已進至瑟堡要塞之外廓陣地，總防衛軍正英勇抵抗。二十五日日反軸心空軍曾對瑟堡要塞作猛烈轟炸，但被德軍擊落二十一架，德軍復曾於去該市約八公里之地點迎擊美戰車隊，擊毀其十三輛。又由要塞南方來攻之美軍，已近至距要塞約二公里之地方，該外廓陣地之德軍，正據守陣地猛烈反擊。</p>
<p>柏林二十五日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：聖羅以北之美軍，因遭德方砲火有效轟擊，巳避離約一公里，二十三日放棄維普拉基，是日聖羅之東北亦發生激戰，美軍戰死及被俘者甚衆。</p>
<p>緬甸戰綫即將完全進入雨季了。瑪尼普爾高原，緬甸北部，富貢地區，日軍將士仍冒雨進擊，但在空軍方面，爲豪雨濃雲所阻，不能出擊了。然而在乾季期間，緬甸的日本空軍，在數量上或素質上，雖較遜於敵軍，可是每月平均當擊落敵機百架。自去年雨季吿終的十月起，迄現在止，僅八個月的期間，共計擊滅敵機約達八百架，這眞是値得驚異的技能·而在這戰果的背後，日空軍勇士八月來的死戰，演出了極激烈的航空決戰。下面是朝日新聞特派員從軍報告中描述空戰是一段：</p>
<p>來襲緬甸的敵轟炸機，備有十生的厚的裝甲，七十五米厘的巨砲，飛行在一萬米的高空以上。這種重裝甲，重裝備的敵機，並不是一擊即落的，必須要準確擊中致命彈。被構爲擊落王黑澤少佐有句口頭禪說：「與轟炸機戰鬥即是肉薄攻擊」，實際上緬甸戰鬥隊勇士們的信條，都抱着「必殺捨身」的信條·我曾目觀有五卞架左右的統一式B24型機來襲仰光，那次激烈的空戰，永不能忘却。</p>
<p>是日起飛應戰的勇士，幾乎沒有一個不受傷，少年飛行兵出身的上口伍長，初次臨陣的那天，即從背後向那巨大的統一式　曹長一單機突入敵機十二架的編隊，擊落其五架，面最後復以機相拼擊落一架·這不是一件一件的武勇傳，凡是緬甸的陸軍機，都抱着這種旺盛的戰門精神·</p>
<p>緬甸反攻的主體美重轟炸機B24型，自去年歲暮以來，就這樣被日軍精銳戰鬥機所驅逐的。敵戰鬥機的擊落，也是很困難的。兩軍交戰的數量，常是一對西或五的戰鬥。而近來要擎落一架敵機，與諸戰時大不相同。在初期的激烈戰鬥中，絕對沒有勝算的敵人，以具有速度，高空性能，及上昇性的優秀戰鬥機來襲，彼我相遇時，立即遠颺。然而現在則想祗用一次的攻擊來決定勝敗，因而備砲旣多，口徑亦從十三公分級次第擴大到二十三十七公分級。</p>
<h3>高空性能敵機</h3>
<p>P38，P40,P47,P51，噴火式等，都是這種戰鬥機，有一萬米以上的高空性能。空戰中，能購飛的比對手更高，是勝利的要訣。他們大抵都比我方的進攻高度及邀卽高度來得更高。</p>
<p>日本戰鬥機過道遭種塲合，常設策破　敵的有利態勢，而攻起弱點。以前敵人每處於低位，或不利態勢時，即籍其速度遁去，規則從更高的高度來反攻。</p>
<h3>神乎其技</h3>
<p>五月十八日，有P51型機二十餘架來襲我緬甸中部基地，起飛邀擊的永島中尉所率領的四機，高度不過四百米，敵機以十二架上前利襲擊，待其開始上昇時，其餘八架另從反對的方向同樣來襲。</p>
<p>見對方處於不利態勢而戰意旺盛的敵人，幾次從高俯射。始終處於絕對不利態勢，並爲敵集中攻擊之焦點的永島中尉等，巧妙地廻避敵的射擊，且能擊落敵機二架，　眞是神跡。假使此事勇士門中間有人受敵以靈，則我方或許要有　中損害。故旁觀者都就爲擔心。（泰特</p>
<h3>蘇全綫進攻</h3>
<p>柏林二十五日中央社電　海通社稱：東綫戰事已延至南路，蘇軍自南動攻勢，但除維特勃斯克與奧爾夏附近外，其他各處之戰事，皆不能稱爲攻勢，該兩地爲進入波羅的海各國與白俄羅斯之門戶，故蘇軍集中兵力，以圖一逞，敵軍每於進攻之初，較佔優勢，一待德援軍到達，即被擊退，蘇軍司令部有鑒於此，故在全綫各點均發動攻勢，以阻德軍自一區調軍增援他區。卡萊里亞戰綫，蘇軍攻勢重心，已向北移至奧魯斯與碼頭爾地峽。</p>
<p>斯本二十五日中央社電　每通社訊：斯達林頒布三令，宣吿蘇軍深入維特勃斯克區三十五呷，他處有深入達五十呷者。蘇軍衡入拉爾加湖與阿尼加湖間之芬軍防綫，三日之內圖入市鎭二百餘處，蘇軍之目的似爲一舉擊潰白俄羅斯之防綫，打開通達波羅的海沿岸諸國及東普魯士之道路。</p>

<h3>電車罷工問題　警局發表談話　盼善良職工早日復工</h3>
<p>本市舊一區電車職工罷工問題，經第一警察局於二十三日晚召集公司負責人及職工代表，磋商調停，結果職工原允於二十四日晨復工，乃因其中一部不良份十，從中阻碍，致延解決，一警當局爲維持社會治安計，故對從中阻碍之一部不良份子，現正嚴密調查中，並發表談話如次：</p>
<p>「關於此次上海電事公司發生罷工後，警察當局即從中調停，極力使公司方面依職工要求提高待遇，但職工中有一部不良份子，從中煽動，並對善白職工加以威脅與嗾使，致陷於復工因難之狀態，且有一部不良份子對於欲復工之善良職工，施以妨害行爲。爰本局負有維持治安責任對此等不穩份子言應加以斷然檢舉，現正嚴密調查中，經調停成立後，本應早期復工，但仍陷於罷工狀態，由此可明證爲一部不　份子之煽動所致，望　農職工早日復工，以剷隊市民之障碍。本警局對善良戰工，決予生當保障，務使其萬全，如上澤電車公司職工中有意復工者，希於明（二十六日）照常復歸各自之原職爲盼。」</p>
<h3>工務處將　取締攤販</h3>
<p>本市第一區公署工務處負責人昨語記者稱：　本市滬西閘北及市中心一部份區域，自併入第一區公署管轄範國後，各該區域內之工務行政，如道路淸潔等項，均已由市工務局，先後移交本處接辦，最近市工務局又將建築行政劃歸本處辦理，嗣後關於新併區內建築事項，槪由本處統一辦理，俾申請發給營造執照者，有所便利。</p>
<p>來本市時有不良份子，冒充工務處查勘員，在外招搖，殊爲市民之害，本處刻已密切注意此事。查本處所派之查勘人員，向不穿着制服，但均携有工務處職員證，凡本區內營造場所，遇有查勘人員調查時，可向索閱職員證，如無是項證件者，即係冒充份子，深望市民嚴加注意，以免受欺。</p>
<p>本市各里街居民密集，其出入口之交通，自應保持暢利，不容有任何障礙物之存在，近查各處</p>
<h3>徐天深氏倡導獻鐵</h3>
<p>日前本市經濟局爲督促各界自動繳納廢金屬特召集全市各業同業公會代表舉行座談，盼各會員盡量獻納。茲悉該局局長徐天深爲倡導起見，已自動將寓所所有之積存廢金屬全數獻納，以爲表率。弄口攤肆林立，尤以熱鬧區域內，幾成普遍現象，一旦發生火警，必使全弄人民，擁塞傾軋，危險何堪設想，本處對於此項攤肆，本不發給執照，最短期內，即將嚴予取締，以維里弄市民之安全。</p>
<p>市民往往任意搭建　蓆棚，事前未向工務處請領執照，旣妨火政，又損市容，該處亦將限令拆除，蓋本處對於搭建蘆蓆棚，原有規定，計分夏季執照（四月至九日）臨時執照（每六個月請求展期）二種，市民儘可按照手續，前往申請，固不必貿然從事，而遭拆除之處分及損失也。</p>
<p>人行道上之攤販，最足妨礙交通，且使工務處無法維持街道之整潔，聞工務處亦在着手整頓，以利交通，而整市容。</p>
<h3>短評　强化市商會</h3>
<p>上海特別市商會今天舉行本屈會員大會，將改選理監事牛數。最近一年來，市商會工作比較趨於靜止。推測原因，似在市商會主要人物，兼任了米統會工作，不免分神，顧此失彼。同時，成立了商統會，似乎減少了市商會的工作。可是，市商會的使命與任務，關係整個商業繁榮，客觀上決不能偏忽的。我們希望在這次改選以後，健全組織，重振使命。</p>
<p>减少商人的痛苦，是商會的主要任務。目前有許多不合理現象，正當商人感覺痛苦，而不正常商人則畸形發展，因此工商業不上軌道。今後希望商會負起矯正不合理現象的任務，導使工商業趨於正軌。</p>
<p>市商會是代表商人的發言機構，本身健全以後，對於當局與商人間的隔閡，一面可以代言解除痛苦。對於物價等問題，也可協助當局推行平衡方策。一面對於商人道德，尤須培植，而取締不道德行爲。例如稅收人員往往與若于商人通同作弊，征收所得稅消費特稅等，彼此利用企圖逃避，减少政府稅收。希望商會强化職權，一面解除商人痛苦，一面矯正商人道德。協助政府，奉行戰時法令。</p>

<h3>節約會理事長　張一鵬氏廣播　闡明節約的精義</h3>
<p>上海時別市節約協會理事長張一鵬氏，昨日廣播，題爲「節約的不節約與不節約的節約」，茲錄講詞要旨如下：</p>
<h3>節約的不節約</h3>
<p>本人所欲言者即爲題目上所說節約的不節約與不節約的節約，先舉其例言之，譬如父母對其子女之敎育費，設爲節約而不令上學，則兒女必難求取學問，日後豈有收獲，此誠節約的不節約。再如購買一雙襪子，一種高等品質者爲一百元，而次貨則爲五十元，但質地堅固者，能經久耐用，而劣質者在極短時期即破，如果祗知節約不分其品質優劣，結果亦爲節約的不節約。</p>
<h3>不節約的節約</h3>
<p>其次，目前正在節電時期，當然任何人都應節電，但應先從　戲塲所等不正當消耗方而着手，必須節之又節，省之又省，相反的凡是一種正當工業生產則應儘量去扶助它，使其有充分之電力，能作充分之生產，不能僅從節約電力的觀點上去限制其用電，所以，對一般生產事業方面的用電，如果以不節約的方法去做，才能收得節約的效果，再諭社會人士對慈益公益之捐欵，亦應不節約。譬如去年捐一萬元，而現在爲節約起見，改捐五千元，表百上少出錢，似爲節約，然而現在的社會問題，比去年更嚴重，正賴各界熱心份子，比去年更多的輸將，才能解除這嚴重的社會問題，此所謂不節約的節約。</p>
<h3>節約會的工作</h3>
<p>以上爲本人對於講題的以簡單解釋，最後本人須聲明者，即上海特別市節約協會成立迄今，已整一年，余能於今日　廣播發表所感，尤覺慶幸。按本會自成立後上半期多爲宣傳，及草擬計劃方案等等工作，迨下半期即獲得社會大衆之同情與擁護，人多了解其意義而厲行節約。最近復又得到政府當局之同情與贊意，其現於形者，即爲戰時國民宴會限制條例，以及限制「公務人員送禮辦法」等，確信今後將更有積極展開，而本會在此一年中得能略盡職員，亦感萬分欣幸。願各界在今後多方協力，共同努力，推行此一節約運動，得使其普遍展開而爲社會放一異彩</p>
<h3>普慧大藏經刊行會　積極推行編印工作　盛文頤氏致力文化偉業</h3>
<p>普慧大歲經刋行會，日前（二十四日）召開理事會，到有會長盛文頤·理事李思浩·丁福保·吳蘊齊·陶希泉·陳彬龢等。盛氏聆工作報吿畢，當即決定一年工作計畫，約需費二千六百萬元，日內先撥一千萬元，交存金城銀行，以供積極進行編纂排印之用。</p>
<p>該會校勘工作，甚爲精密。據負責人談，國內歷代各藏，除嘉興藏略有校勘記外，餘向無校勘記。日木弘敎藏取麗宋元淸四藏對校，至昭和再訂一次。大正藏則於各藏外，又取日本所搜得之本均加對校，其校勘本最多。但未用淸龍藏，而中國各處刻本亦未參校。現該會取日本各藏及國內各種刻本如磺砂越城淸藏及一般流通本合校，儘量列出各本異同，實爲歷代以來藏經校勘最詳之本。至校對工作，向以日本卍字正藏爲最精，初二三校各易一人擔任，今亦仿其法。有時並作四校。往往經四五人之手，以求無誤云云。該會工作精神於此可見一斑，而盛氏於佛敎文化上之貢獻，誠爲不朽</p>

<h3>Editorial: Reflections the Education Sector Should Have</h3>
<p>Time flies, and this academic year is drawing to a close. Although the seasons change and time does not stay, if we can grasp the present and make full use of it, and diligently advance our work, then each month will have its achievements, and each year will have its effects. If we waste our time and accomplish nothing, or even sow the seeds of future evil in the precious time we have, then wouldn't we be not only failing the great times but also becoming sinners to future generations? Therefore, what is frightening lies here and not elsewhere. Moreover, the education sector itself has the function of passing on the past and ushering in the future. The weight of its responsibility and the distance of its influence are unmatched by other sectors. Therefore, at the end of the academic year, we urge everyone in the education sector to deeply reflect on themselves.</p>
<p>Education Authorities: The reason why the country establishes education authorities is not to accommodate redundant personnel or create a formality, but because education must have policies, systems, and goals. It cannot allow schools in various regions to act independently. Therefore, an organization is established to specialize in overall planning. Try reflecting on the past year: Have we determined educational principles that are suitable for the present and targeted at the future? Have we gradually implemented these principles? Have the schools been able to follow this purpose and advance it practically? Have we developed concrete solutions to address the difficulties and realities that schools and students are currently experiencing, such as wartime education issues, the living problems of teachers and staff, and students' tuition problems? Do the teaching standards and graduation levels of each school meet the requirements? The answers to these reflections will not only judge the merits and demerits of the past, but also serve as the basis for the work content and progress of the next academic year.</p>
<p>Authorities: Schools are divided into public and private, but the responsibility of those in charge of school affairs is simply to implement the laws and regulations of the education authorities and directly exert the function of the school. On the one hand, they are responsible to the government, and on the other hand, they supervise teachers and students. Try reflecting on the past year: Have we been worthy of the country and responsible to the students? Have we managed the school with the spirit of running a school, without being tainted by the atmosphere of profiteering? Have we used what we have taken from the government or the students for the school? Have we, within the possible range, improved and supplemented both the spirit (in terms of moral education) and the material (in terms of equipment) of the school? Have we done our best to make teachers feel at ease in teaching, and are the teachers we have hired truly role models in terms of character and learning? Have we understood the inner distress of the students and provided them with reasonable explanations? Have we noticed the psychological crises of the students and corrected them effectively? Have we adopted an open attitude and accepted criticism and accusations from within and outside the school? The answers to these reflections will inevitably be different for each person. If you recognize that there are shortcomings, you must overcome the difficulties to achieve the goal. Complaining about heaven and blaming others is not something that the school authorities, who are directly responsible for the mission of education, should do.</p>
<p>Teachers at All Levels: (A) Elementary School Teachers: Should reflect on whether they understand the psychology and physiology of elementary school students; whether they pay attention to the coordination of elementary school students' studies and health; whether they observe the subtle words and actions of elementary school students that may affect their entire lives and provide them with proper guidance; and whether they respect the personality of each elementary school student and provide individual guidance in addition to classroom teaching. (B) Secondary School Teachers: Should reflect on whether they thoroughly understand and master the subjects they teach; whether they constantly research and improve their teaching methods in order to arouse students' interest; whether they pay attention to discipline training at all times and places, and whether they themselves have the cultivation to discipline themselves; whether, under the principle of "learning to understand reason," they constantly instill elements of thought and conduct at all times and places; and whether they take into account the mission of wartime education. (C) University Teachers: Should reflect on whether their own academic ability and character are worthy of the title of "professor"; whether they have the path and interest in researching knowledge that can inspire students to follow; whether they can contribute to specialized academics or skills, and take into account the mission of wartime education, in order to enhance the status of Chinese universities internationally; and whether they can establish some foundations in cultural undertakings as a ladder for future generations to strive for. The answers to these reflections will also be different for each person, but in any case, you must seek peace of mind. Those who feel that they are not suitable to be teachers should change to other professions to avoid misleading themselves and others. As for the current hardships of life, it may not be unreasonable to say that they have not been able to develop their own abilities. If they have extraordinary knowledge and personality, the worse the environment, the easier it is to receive the effect of inspiration.</p>
<p>Students at All Levels: Elementary school students who are too young are not able to reflect on themselves, but students above middle school should not continue to be ignorant and unaware. Try reflecting on the past year: Have we buried ourselves in our studies and lived up to the title of "student"? Did we enter school to seek knowledge? Have we been able to fully receive the teacher's transmission and make full use of the facilities? Have we been able to digest the textbooks we have learned and apply them effectively? Have we been able to use our existing foundation to progress automatically? Have we understood the wartime environment and strived to improve our learning and conduct? Is the subject we have chosen close to our own talents and do we feel interested? Have we established our ambitions and have the spirit of asceticism? The answers to these reflections can make people feel cold or angry. There is no shortage of excuses for wanting to shirk responsibility. However, blue can be extracted from indigo, and disciples do not necessarily have to be inferior to their teachers. Turning stone into gold, those with ambition do not need to worry about failing. Carrying firewood and hanging horns, they gathered to become great Confucian scholars. School servants and small workers can become masters, while those who are well-dressed and from famous families end up being worthless. How will they justify themselves?</p>
<p>In addition, we must comprehensively analyze the results of the reflections of the above aspects, unite with the truly concerned people in society, and jointly explore and cultivate the field of education with collective efforts. Then, the harvest we get can hopefully be better next year than this year. The past is gone, and the future can be advanced. If we continue to procrastinate, we must wait for the entire education system to go bankrupt before seeking restoration. Then, the effort will be doubled and the result will be halved, or it may even be impossible! The education sector and people in society should not be so foolish as to let this happen. We hope that they will reflect early and take action quickly!</p>
<p>Japanese Aircraft Squadrons Bravely Fight West of Saipan Island, Enemy Aircraft Heavily Damaged Southeast of Iwo Jima</p>
<p>Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) – According to a report from a Japanese military base in the central Pacific, Japanese aircraft in the Saipan area bombed enemy positions southwest of the island on the night of the 24th to assist Japanese troops in land operations, and fiercely attacked enemy landing points and their boat groups.</p>
<p>Japanese military base in the Pacific, 25th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese air force discovered an enemy large transport ship of 10,000 tons in the waters west of Saipan Island at dawn on the 25th, and launched a fierce attack on it, sinking it. On the night of the 24th, they also bravely bombed enemy positions, and all bombs hit their targets.</p>
<p>Japanese military base in the central Pacific, 25th (Central News Agency) – On the morning of the 24th, Japanese aircraft squadrons intercepted enemy mobile units in the waters southeast of Iwo Jima, repeatedly launching torpedo and bombing attacks, and finally destroyed two enemy aircraft carriers. They are still continuing their attacks, and it is expected that the results of the battle in that area will be further expanded.</p>
<p>Japanese military base in the central Pacific, 25th (Central News Agency) – In the Iwo Jima area of the Ogasawara Islands, about 60 enemy carrier-based bombers and fighters attacked on the morning of the 24th, and the Japanese fighter squadrons shot down more than 37 of them.</p>
<h3>A Week of War in East Asia</h3>
<p>— (Continued from previous)</p>
<p>On the 17th, the enemy received reinforcements from follow-up units and cover from air units, advancing towards the Aslito airfield. Japanese troops in Tinian fiercely counterattacked across the Saipan Strait, with intense artillery fire. On the 19th, part of the Japanese Combined Fleet launched a preemptive attack on the enemy's mobile fleet in the waters west of the Mariana Islands. By the 20th, they had sunk and damaged enemy ships, including five aircraft carriers and one battleship, and shot down over a hundred aircraft. The Japanese side lost one aircraft carrier and two oil tankers, and lost fifty aircraft. Since the enemy appeared on Saipan Island, the Japanese army has launched continuous attacks. From the 12th to the 20th, in addition to the results achieved by part of the Japanese Combined Fleet in the waters west of the Mariana Islands, they sank one enemy battleship, two cruisers, one destroyer, and one submarine; destroyed four enemy aircraft carriers, two battleships, four destroyers, six transport ships, and one unidentified warship. On the night of the 21st, Japanese aircraft fiercely bombed the enemy landing points in the Saipan Strait, heavily damaging the enemy boat groups. All Japanese aircraft have safely returned to base. While the battle for Saipan Island is fierce, 21 enemy B24 aircraft attacked Truk Island on the afternoon of the 13th, and 27 enemy B24 aircraft attacked again on the morning of the 14th, of which six were shot down by the Japanese army. In the Biak Island area of the South Pacific, the enemy is gradually increasing its forces and expanding its territory. The current strength is one and a half divisions. One airfield on the south side of the island seems to have fallen into enemy hands. The Japanese army and the enemy are facing each other closely, and are continuing to fight fiercely. The results of the battle confirmed up to the 14th include approximately 1,000 enemy bodies abandoned, 15 enemy tanks destroyed, 9 boats full of soldiers sunk, 2 artillery pieces captured, and the enemy appears to be building an airfield on Woendi Island, opposite the landing point. (Sarmi Area) (Ter River Estuary), due to the valiant fighting of the Japanese army, the enemy forces were almost completely destroyed near the coast. The enemy reinforced its forces from around the 5th. The Japanese army continued to attack the enemy on the left bank of the Ter River, and at the same time, launched fierce attacks on the enemy on the Tem Alala East side, inflicting heavy damage. The Japanese army defended the Sarmi, Hollandia, and Wewak nearby coastlines, using cannons and heavy weapons to bravely shoot and destroy enemy torpedo boats, and has secured control of the sea near the coastline. In early June, enemy aircraft attacked New Guinea 122 times, totaling 1,365 aircraft. The Japanese army shot down 28 aircraft (one unconfirmed) and destroyed 10 aircraft. (Bougainville Island), the Japanese army in that area secured positions around the enemy bridgehead near Torokina with a small number of troops. Approximately 200 US troops attacked Taisi (20 kilometers northeast of Torokina on the left bank of the Koroki River) on the 5th and 6th, but were repelled by the Japanese army. Also, a strong enemy force landed in Tabera (25 kilometers southeast of Torokina) on the 3rd and 4th, and the Japanese army destroyed them. From the 3rd to the 6th, the results of the battle included 191 enemy bodies abandoned, 2 mortars destroyed, 9 light and heavy machine guns captured, and 17 rifles. Two enemy torpedo boats were hit and caught fire. The Japanese side suffered 5 casualties. On the 15th and 16th, 28 enemy B24 aircraft, 31 B26 aircraft, and 20 fighters attacked Manokwari from Rabaul, and the Japanese side shot down 5 aircraft. In India, 35 enemy fighter-bombers attacked Port Blair in the Andaman Islands on the 20th. The Japanese army shot down 6 aircraft and destroyed 4 aircraft. The Japanese army had only one small boat hit and caught fire. According to reports, these enemy aircraft flew in from the enemy mobile unit, so it is necessary to be extremely vigilant about the movement of the enemy mobile unit. In the north, as of June 15th, several enemy aircraft attacked the North Kuril Islands twice. Japanese aircraft and anti-aircraft artillery shot down two enemy aircraft. On the nights of the 17th, 18th, and 19th, several enemy aircraft attacked, but they were repelled by the Japanese air defense forces and failed to achieve their purpose. All bombs fell into the sea. On the 14th, enemy ships shelled the North Kuril Islands, followed by bombing on the morning of the 15th. It is believed that this may be a containment action of the Nimitz offensive in the central Pacific, but serious vigilance is still necessary.</p>
<h3>Exhibition to Eradicate British and American Paintings Held in Nanjing</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency) – The "Exhibition to Eradicate British and American Paintings and Dedicate Aircraft," organized by the Capital Japanese Painting Club and Suishisha, opened at the Morinaga Tea Room in Daxing Palace yesterday (25th) morning. All 53 works by various artists, including oil paintings, watercolors, landscapes, and sketches, were extremely exquisite, and visitors were very enthusiastic.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army on the West Bank of the Nu River Continues to Advance</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 25th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese army continues to advance against the Yunnan Expeditionary Force of the Chongqing government on the west bank of the Nu River. On the 19th, the Chongqing army attacked the highlands north of Longling. After a counterattack by the Japanese army, the Chongqing army abandoned more than 200 bodies and many heavy machine guns and ammunition and fled. The Japanese army is currently pursuing the remnants. Also, the Chongqing army that tried to move around Lameng was also defeated by the Japanese army. On the 18th and 19th, the Chongqing army abandoned 170 bodies. The Japanese army captured 3 mortars and machine guns. In addition, the Chongqing army that attacked near the platform was also heavily damaged and retreated. Therefore, the 60,000 Chongqing troops on the Nu River have been collapsing frequently in just over a month since the start of the counteroffensive.</p>
<h3>Hunan Front: Japanese Army Occupies Pingxiang, Fierce Battles Unfold in the Mountainous Area</h3>
<p>Hunan Front, 25th (Central News Agency) – After breaking through the Wanyang Mountains on the border of the Hubei and Jiangxi provinces, the Japanese army on the Hunan front encountered the 26th Army of the Chongqing army, which came from the Third War Zone, near Pingxiang on the morning of the 22nd, and launched a fierce battle. By 3:00 PM yesterday, the invading Chongqing army had been defeated and Pingxiang was occupied. After Gu Zhutong, commander of the Third War Zone, received the news that the Japanese army had broken through the provincial border, he immediately ordered the 26th Army under his command to rush to Pingxiang to take charge of defense, in order to secure the coalfields in the area. As a result, Ding Zhipan, commander of the 26th Army, led the 44th and 41st Divisions to arrive near Yingwu on the evening of the 21st. He built field fortifications in the mountains in front of the defense line already established there to prevent the Japanese army from advancing. However, due to the Japanese army's three-pronged defense operations and the fierce attack by the Japanese army that broke into the Chongqing army's position from the rear, they were defeated and retreated. They have occupied the coalfield area near Pingxiang, and another part of the Japanese army is rapidly pursuing the defeated Chongqing army. At present, an annihilation battle is unfolding in the mountainous area.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 25th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from Chongqing, the Chongqing government announced the situation of the Hunan war on the 24th as follows: The Japanese army advanced circuitously from Hengshan, and one part of it had advanced to the southeast of Hengyang, and the fighting along the Xiang River was even more intense. The Japanese army has now begun to attack Leixi (7 kilometers south of Hengshan on the east bank of the Xiang River) and Lyuji (20 kilometers southeast of Hengshan). The fighting in that area is intense.</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Reconnoiter Hengyang Airfield</h3>
<p>Japanese military base, 25th (Central News Agency) – After capturing Changsha and Liling, the Japanese army heavily damaged the direct army of Xue Yue of the Chongqing government and is still continuing its rapid advance. According to Chongqing sources, Hengyang is the advanced base of the Chongqing-US air force in central China. Fearing the Japanese army's attack, it is currently evacuating the population. It is also said that they are determined to prepare for defense and resistance. However, according to reconnaissance by Japanese aircraft, the Chongqing-US air force had long heard the news and fled far away. No traces of Chongqing aircraft were seen at the airfield. The entire airfield is almost like a dummy. Although the facilities are largely as before, some of them seem to have been destroyed, and the runways seem to be being prepared for destruction. Hengyang is the center of the advanced base group of the Chongqing-US air forces in southwest China and was once boasted as an aviation fortress. It is 300 kilometers away from Guilin, and there are other important bases nearby, such as Liling (130 kilometers southwest), Binqing (100 kilometers southwest), and (Chuan) Southeast 200 kilometers). However, the Japanese army's attack on Hunan this time has heavily damaged each of these places. Because the Chongqing-US air force in the southwest bases has been suppressed by the Japanese army, they feel extremely embarrassed. In the area east of the line connecting Hengyang and Guangdong, the Chongqing-US air force built the first-line bases for attacking Japan, such as Suichuan, Jian'ou, and Hanzhou. At the same time, a new airfield, larger in scale than Suichuan, was newly built in the mountainous area about 100 kilometers south of Suichuan, as a pool for attacking Japan, but these attempts by the Chongqing army completely failed.</p>
<h3>Japanese Scientists Invent a New Method for Manufacturing Aircraft, Which Will Soar Into the Sky Soon</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) – The production of aircraft is increasing, and as the aerial warfare intensifies, it is also becoming more and more urgent. At the same time, in order to replace the bauxite mines in the south, the production of light metals in Japan is also in urgent demand for increase. It is learned that a Japanese domestic light metal factory has made a new invention for the special manufacturing method of light metals, which is truly a great achievement in Japan's scientific war. In the past, Japan had researched the method of using materials other than southern bauxite mines to make light metals for aircraft, but no good results had appeared. The new manufacturing method invented by Dr. Hiroshi Tanaka is the greatest success in the world of science. The new manufacturing method not only saves a large amount of raw materials and materials, but its production volume is also four times higher than the old manufacturing method. Now, the factory has refined some of the crude products produced during the period of increased production of light metals from April 1st to September 30th this year. Therefore, aircraft made from these materials, made entirely in Japan, will soon soar into the blue sky.</p>
<h3>Thai Embassy in Japan Holds Celebration</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) – The Thai Embassy in Japan held a grand celebration on the 24th of this month to commemorate Thailand's National Day. At 4:00 PM that afternoon, the Thai Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary and his wife personally invited diplomatic representatives from various countries to attend. Those present included Cai Pei, the Chinese Ambassador to Japan, Aokida, the Japanese Minister of Greater East Asia, Ambassador and Mrs. Tsubakami, the Philippine Chargé d'Affaires, Rakides, the Burmese Ambassador, Zai Mung, and the Spanish Minister, the Bulgarian Minister, etc. Thai classical music was played in the hall, and the atmosphere was very harmonious. In addition, Japanese Foreign Minister and Mrs. Shigemitsu, Palace Minister Matsudaira, and Education Minister and Mrs. Okabe, Nitta Yoshiaki, former Imperial Household Minister Sato, Military Affairs Bureau Chief Sakurakawa Hyogoro, and others were also present. A total of 300 guests attended that day. Finally, Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki and Thai Ambassador Wattayangkul initiated a joint prayer for the victory of the Axis powers, and the meeting adjourned at about 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Wallace Concludes Talks in Chongqing</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 25th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from Chongqing, US Vice President Wallace held meetings with Chiang Kai-shek and other Chongqing leaders after arriving in Chongqing on the 20th of this month. The meeting largely concluded on the 24th.</p>
<h3>Saitama Wheat Variety Excellent</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) – According to a report from Wawa, since the Saitama wheat No. 27 seeds were trial-planted in various places in the south two years ago, the results have shown that if they are planted in areas with a certain elevation, their yield is not inferior to that of mainland Japan. Therefore, various places have sent letters to Saitama Prefecture to order this variety, and the quantitative order has reached 10,000 shi. In order to cooperate with the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere's food production increase, the prefectural government has decided to select 1,000 shi (Saitama No. 27 seeds) from the current high-quality wheat. It is determined that it will not be inferior to American and Australian wheat varieties, and it is very suitable for cultivation in various places in the south. Therefore, it is believed that the future production volume will far surpass Australian wheat.</p>
<h3>Turkey Avoids War</h3>
<p>Budapest, 25th (Central News Agency) – According to news from Ankara, it is said that Turkish government officials, diplomatic envoys from various countries stationed in Ankara, and the German ambassador, etc., have all stopped going to Istanbul for summer vacation, and the political circles in Ankara have become tense. According to the current Turkish military and political authorities, Turkey will avoid breaking with the three Soviet countries at the least sacrifice and avoid participating in the war.</p>
<p>Istanbul, 25th (Central News Agency) – Reuters reports: It is officially announced here that the state of emergency declared in Istanbul and Trass will be extended for another six months.</p>
<h3>北法瑟堡要塞　展開市街戰　德防衛軍精銳奮抗中</h3>
<p>Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency) - According to reports from the Northern France front: Fierce battles are currently taking place between the streets of Cherbourg and its defensive positions.</p>
<p>Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency) - German military authorities announced on the 24th that the great offensive and defensive battle of Cherbourg has reached its climax. American commander Bradley has deployed infantry and two armored divisions in a general assault on Cherbourg. Enemy artillery and fleets are also constantly bombarding German forces, and their air force is bombing the interior of German fortresses from time to time. American ground forces are disregarding losses, attacking from three sides. Enemy forces attacking from the south and southeast have been completely defeated after fierce fighting. American forces attacking from the southwest have broken into the front of the fortress.</p>
<p>Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency) - According to the German News Agency: Apart from the Cherbourg front in Normandy, the anti-Axis forces have only launched local counterattacks in areas such as Coulombs. The anti-Axis forces are currently reorganizing their remnants. American forces on the Cotentin Peninsula are desperately trying to seize Cherbourg, but the German forces in the Cherbourg fortress are elite troops with extensive combat experience. In addition, the German forces have rendered the harbor unusable. Therefore, although the American forces have sacrificed the greatest price, they have still not achieved their objective. Currently, the American 4th, 9th, 17th, and 90th Divisions, as well as tank units, have advanced to the outer defensive positions of the Cherbourg fortress. The general defense forces are bravely resisting. On the 25th, the anti-Axis air force launched a fierce bombing raid on the Cherbourg fortress but was shot down 21 aircraft by the German forces. German forces also intercepted an American tank force about eight kilometers from the city, destroying thirteen of them. Also, American forces attacking from the south of the fortress have approached to within about two kilometers of the fortress. The German forces in the outer defensive positions are holding their ground and fiercely counterattacking.</p>
<p>Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports: American forces north of Saint-Lô have withdrawn about one kilometer due to effective bombardment by German artillery fire and abandoned Vipparaki on the 23rd. On that day, fierce battles also occurred northeast of Saint-Lô, with numerous American soldiers killed and captured.</p>
<p>The Burma front is about to fully enter the rainy season. In the Manipur Plateau, northern Burma, and the Fukung area, Japanese soldiers are still advancing in the rain, but in the air force, they are hindered by heavy rain and thick clouds and cannot launch attacks. However, during the dry season, the Japanese air force in Burma, although inferior to the enemy in quantity or quality, shot down an average of 100 enemy aircraft per month. Since October, when last year's rainy season ended, up to the present, in just eight months, they have destroyed approximately 800 enemy aircraft, which is truly an astonishing skill. Behind this achievement, the eight months of desperate fighting by Japanese air force warriors has produced extremely fierce aerial decisive battles. The following is an excerpt from a military report by an Asahi Shimbun correspondent describing an air battle:</p>
<p>The enemy bombers attacking Burma are equipped with thick armor, 75 mm cannons, and fly at altitudes above 10,000 meters. These heavily armored and equipped enemy aircraft are not easily shot down with a single hit; a fatal shot must be accurately aimed. Major Kurosawa, known as the "Ace of Aces," often said, "Fighting bombers is like a close-quarters attack." In fact, the creed of the Burmese combat team warriors is to embrace the belief of "certain kill, self-sacrifice." I once witnessed about fifty B-24 type aircraft attacking Rangoon, and that fierce air battle will never be forgotten.</p>
<p>Almost every warrior who took off to meet the enemy that day was injured. Sergeant Kamiguchi, a former youth pilot, on his first combat mission, attacked a formation of twelve enemy aircraft from behind, shooting down five of them. Finally, he crashed his plane into another, shooting it down. These are not isolated tales of bravery; all army aircraft in Burma hold this vigorous fighting spirit.</p>
<p>The main force of the Burmese counteroffensive, the American heavy bomber B-24, has been driven away by elite Japanese fighter planes since the end of last year. Shooting down enemy fighters is also very difficult. The ratio of engagements is often one to four or five. Recently, shooting down an enemy aircraft is very different from in previous battles. In the initial fierce battles, the enemy, who had no chance of winning, attacked with excellent fighters that had speed, high-altitude performance, and climb rate, and would immediately flee when they met us. However, now they want to decide victory or defeat with a single attack, so they have more cannons, and the caliber has gradually increased from 13 cm class to 20 or 37 cm class.</p>
<h3>High-Altitude Performance Enemy Aircraft</h3>
<p>P-38, P-40, P-47, P-51, Spitfire, etc., are all fighters of this type, with high-altitude performance above 10,000 meters. In aerial combat, being able to fly higher than your opponent is the key to victory. They are generally higher than our attacking or intercepting altitudes.</p>
<p>When Japanese fighters encounter such situations, they often devise ways to break the enemy's advantageous position and attack their weaknesses. Previously, when the enemy was in a low position or disadvantageous situation, they would use their speed to escape and counterattack from a higher altitude.</p>
<h3>Divine Skill</h3>
<p>On May 18, more than twenty P-51 type aircraft attacked our central Burma base. The four aircraft led by Lieutenant Nagashima, who took off to intercept them, were only 400 meters high. Twelve enemy aircraft attacked them from above. When they began to climb, the remaining eight aircraft attacked from the opposite direction.</p>
<p>The enemy, seeing their opponent in a disadvantageous position, had a strong fighting spirit and fired from high above several times. Lieutenant Nagashima, who was always in an absolutely disadvantageous position and the focus of enemy attacks, skillfully evaded the enemy's gunfire and was able to shoot down two enemy aircraft. It was truly a miracle. If one of these brave warriors had been hit by the enemy with a bullet, we might have suffered heavy losses. Therefore, onlookers were all worried. (Teit)</p>
<h3>Soviet Full-Line Offensive</h3>
<p>Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency reported: The Eastern Front has extended to the southern route. Soviet forces have launched offensives from the south, but apart from the areas near Vitebsk and Orsha, the battles in other locations cannot be called offensives. These two places are the gateways to the Baltic countries and Belarus, so the Soviet forces have concentrated their forces in an attempt to succeed. The enemy often has the upper hand at the beginning of an attack, but once German reinforcements arrive, they are repelled. The Soviet command, aware of this, has launched offensives along the entire line to prevent German forces from transferring troops from one area to reinforce another. On the Karelian front, the focus of the Soviet offensive has shifted north to Olus and the Molotkov Isthmus.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 25th (Central News Agency) - United Press reports: Stalin issued three orders, announcing that Soviet forces had penetrated 35 versts into the Vitebsk region and up to 50 versts in other areas. Soviet forces have penetrated the Finnish defense line between Lake Lalga and Lake Aniega, capturing more than 200 towns in three days. The Soviet objective appears to be to crush the Belarusian defense line in one fell swoop, opening the road to the Baltic coast and East Prussia.</p>

<h3>Budget</h3>
<p>Regarding the budget, according to the constitution, it should be submitted to the general meeting for resolution and reported to the competent authorities for record. However, due to the recent surge in prices of various goods, which has deviated from the norm, preparing a budget has become difficult. In order to suit the actual situation, after the end of the fiscal year, the budget and final accounts will be prepared simultaneously, submitted to the board of directors for approval, sent to the board of supervisors for review, and then submitted to the general meeting for ratification and reporting. Discussion will be postponed at the general meeting. Regarding membership dues that have yet to be paid, members who have not paid their dues have been notified by letter to pay as soon as possible before the meeting to facilitate attendance at the general meeting.</p>

<h3>Tram Strike Problem Police Bureau Issues Statement Hoping Good Employees Will Return to Work Soon</h3>
<p>Regarding the tram employee strike in the former First District of this city, the First Police Bureau summoned company leaders and employee representatives on the evening of the 23rd to discuss mediation. As a result, the employees originally agreed to return to work on the morning of the 24th, but because of the obstruction of some bad elements, the resolution was delayed. The police authorities, in order to maintain social order, are now closely investigating these bad elements who are obstructing the process, and issued the following statement:</p>
<p>"Regarding the strike at the Shanghai Electric Tram Company, the police authorities immediately intervened to mediate and tried their best to make the company increase wages according to the demands of the employees, but some bad elements among the employees incited the strike and threatened and instigated good employees, resulting in a difficult return to work. Some bad elements have also committed acts of obstructing good employees who want to return to work. Therefore, this bureau, which is responsible for maintaining public order, should resolutely report these unstable elements and is currently conducting a close investigation. After the mediation was successful, work should have resumed early, but the strike is still ongoing, which clearly demonstrates that it is due to the incitement of some bad elements. We hope that the farmer employees will return to work as soon as possible to eliminate obstacles for citizens. This police bureau will provide appropriate protection to good battle workers to ensure their safety. If any employees of the Uesawa Tram Company intend to return to work, it is hoped that they will return to their original positions as usual tomorrow (the 26th)."</p>
<h3>Public Works Department Will Ban Street Vendors</h3>
<p>The person in charge of the Public Works Department of the First District Office told reporters yesterday: After the areas of Zhabei and western Shanghai were incorporated into the jurisdiction of the First District Office, the public works administration in these areas, such as road cleaning, have been transferred to this office by the Municipal Public Works Bureau. Recently, the Municipal Public Works Bureau also transferred architectural administration to this office. From now on, all architectural matters in the newly incorporated areas will be handled uniformly by this office to facilitate those who apply for construction permits.</p>
<p>Recently, some bad elements in this city have impersonated surveyors from the Public Works Department, which is harmful to citizens. This office is paying close attention to this matter. The surveyors dispatched by this office never wear uniforms, but they all carry Public Works Department employee identification cards. When surveyors investigate construction sites in this district, they can ask to see the employee identification card. If they do not have such a card, they are impersonators. We hope that citizens will pay close attention to avoid being deceived.</p>
<p>The residents of various neighborhoods and streets in this city are densely populated, and the traffic at the entrances and exits should be kept clear and unobstructed. According to recent investigations,</p>
<h3>Mr. Xu Tianshen Advocates Donating Iron</h3>
<p>The other day, the Municipal Economic Bureau specially convened representatives from various trade associations in the city to hold a forum to urge all sectors to voluntarily pay waste metal. It is learned that the Bureau Chief Xu Tianshen has voluntarily donated all the accumulated waste metal in his residence as an example. There are many stalls lining the alleys, especially in busy areas, which has become a widespread phenomenon. Once a fire breaks out, it will inevitably cause all the people in the alley to be crowded and crushed, and the danger is unimaginable. This office does not issue licenses for these stalls, and will strictly ban them in the shortest possible time to maintain the safety of the residents in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>Citizens often arbitrarily build reed sheds without applying for a permit from the Public Works Department in advance, which obstructs fire prevention and damages the city's appearance. The office will also order their demolition. There are original regulations for the construction of reed sheds, which are divided into summer licenses (April to September) and temporary licenses (requesting renewal every six months). Citizens can apply according to the procedures, so there is no need to act rashly and suffer demolition and losses.</p>
<p>Vendors on the sidewalks are most likely to obstruct traffic and make it impossible for the Public Works Department to maintain the cleanliness of the streets. It is heard that the Public Works Department is also working to rectify this to facilitate traffic and beautify the city.</p>
<h3>Short Commentary Strengthen the City Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Chamber of Commerce is holding its general meeting today and will re-elect half of the directors and supervisors. In the past year, the work of the City Chamber of Commerce has been relatively stagnant. The reason for this is speculated to be that the key figures in the City Chamber of Commerce also hold positions in the Rice Control Committee, which inevitably distracts them and causes them to neglect one thing or another. At the same time, the establishment of the Business Control Committee seems to have reduced the work of the City Chamber of Commerce. However, the mission and tasks of the City Chamber of Commerce are related to the prosperity of the entire business sector, and objectively, they cannot be ignored. We hope that after this re-election, the organization will be strengthened and the mission will be revitalized.</p>
<p>Reducing the suffering of businessmen is the main task of the Chamber of Commerce. There are many unreasonable phenomena at present, and legitimate businessmen are feeling pain, while illegitimate businessmen are developing abnormally, so industry and commerce are not on track. In the future, it is hoped that the Chamber of Commerce will take on the task of correcting unreasonable phenomena and guiding industry and commerce back to the right track.</p>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce is the voice of businessmen. After its own health, it can act as a voice to relieve pain for the gap between the authorities and businessmen. It can also assist the authorities in implementing balancing strategies on issues such as prices. On the one hand, the morality of businessmen must be cultivated, and immoral acts must be curbed. For example, tax collectors often collude with some businessmen to cheat and evade taxes such as income tax and consumption tax, thereby reducing government tax revenue. It is hoped that the Chamber of Commerce will strengthen its powers, on the one hand, to alleviate the suffering of businessmen, and on the other hand, to correct the morality of businessmen. Assist the government in implementing wartime laws.</p>

<h3>President of the Thrift Association, Zhang Yipeng, Broadcasts Elucidating the Essence of Thrift</h3>
<p>Zhang Yipeng, president of the Shanghai Special City Thrift Association, broadcasted yesterday on the topic of "Thrift That Isn't Thrift and Non-Thrift That Is Thrift." The main points of the speech are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Thrift That Isn't Thrift</h3>
<p>What I want to say is thrift that isn't thrift and non-thrift that is thrift, as stated in the title. First, let me give an example. For example, if parents are frugal with their children's education expenses and do not let them go to school, then the children will inevitably have difficulty acquiring knowledge, and how can they reap the benefits in the future? This is truly thrift that isn't thrift. Another example is buying a pair of socks. A high-quality pair costs 100 yuan, while a second-rate pair costs 50 yuan, but the durable pair will last longer, while the inferior pair will break in a very short period. If you only know how to be thrifty and do not distinguish between quality, the result is also thrift that isn't thrift.</p>
<h3>Non-Thrift That Is Thrift</h3>
<p>Secondly, we are currently in a period of power conservation. Of course, everyone should conserve power, but we should start with improper consumption in places such as theaters. We must conserve as much as possible. Conversely, we should help any legitimate industrial production as much as possible, so that it has sufficient power to produce sufficiently. We cannot limit its electricity use solely from the perspective of conserving electricity. Therefore, if we use non-thrifty methods for electricity use in general production, we can achieve the effect of thrift. Furthermore, we should also not be thrifty when it comes to donations to charitable and public welfare causes. For example, if you donated 10,000 yuan last year, and now you donate 5,000 yuan in the name of thrift, it seems like you are spending less money, but the social problems now are more serious than last year, and we rely on enthusiastic people from all walks of life to contribute more than last year to solve these serious social problems. This is what is called non-thrift that is thrift.</p>
<h3>Work of the Thrift Association</h3>
<p>The above is my simple explanation of the topic. Finally, I must declare that the Shanghai Special City Thrift Association has been established for a whole year. I am especially fortunate to be able to broadcast my feelings today. Since its establishment, the Association has spent most of the first half of the year on publicity and drafting plans. In the second half of the year, it gained the sympathy and support of the general public. People generally understood its meaning and practiced thrift. Recently, it has also gained the sympathy and approval of the government. What is currently visible is the "Wartime National Banquet Restriction Ordinance" and the "Measures for Restricting Gifts by Public Officials," etc. I am confident that there will be more active developments in the future, and the Association is very pleased to be able to do its best in this year. I hope that all sectors will cooperate in the future to jointly promote this thrift movement, so that it can be widely carried out and add a unique color to society.</p>
<h3>Universal Wisdom Great Canon Publishing Association Actively Promotes Compilation and Printing Mr. Sheng Wenyi Devotes Himself to Great Cultural Undertakings</h3>
<p>The Universal Wisdom Great Canon Publishing Association held a board meeting recently (24th). Those in attendance included Chairman Sheng Wenyi and directors Li Sihao, Ding Fubao, Wu Yunqi, Tao Xiquan, and Chen Binhe. After Sheng heard the work report, he immediately decided on a one-year work plan, which would cost approximately 26 million yuan. He immediately allocated 10 million yuan to deposit at the Jin Cheng Bank for active compilation and printing.</p>
<p>The Association's collation work is very meticulous. According to the person in charge, apart from the Jiaxing Canon, which has some collation notes, the other canons of past dynasties in China have no collation notes. The Japanese Hongjiao Canon takes the Li, Song, Yuan, and Qing Canons for comparison and collates them once again in the Showa era. The Taisho Canon, in addition to the various canons, also adds the books collected in Japan for comparison, so its collation is the most. However, the Qinglong Canon was not used, and the engraved editions in various parts of China were also not consulted. Now, the Association takes the Japanese canons and various domestic engraved editions, such as the Kuangsha Yuecheng Qing Canon and general circulating editions, for combined comparison, and lists the differences between the various editions as much as possible, which is the most detailed collation of the canon since past dynasties. As for the proofreading work, the Japanese Manji Canon has always been the most refined. Initially, two or three proofs were done by different people. Now, it also imitates this method. Sometimes, four proofs are done. It often goes through the hands of four or five people to ensure that there are no errors. The Association's work spirit can be seen from this, and Mr. Sheng's contribution to Buddhist culture is truly immortal.</p>
<h3>Sports Friendly Soccer Match: Hualian vs. First Police to be Held at the Racecourse Tomorrow</h3>
<p>An exciting friendly soccer match between Hualian and the First Police is scheduled to take place at the racecourse tomorrow (Tuesday) at 5:30 PM. Tickets are uniformly 100 yuan. The First Police has just won the runner-up in the Group A league. Although they lost to the ever-victorious Donghua twice, both scores were 3 to 2, which shows their strength. They have famous generals such as Robert Stov, Corlett, Mai Qichang, Savin, and Chinese players Yu Liming and his brother, Yuan Kuntian, who are all famous generals on the battlefield, and their combat power can be called strong. Hualian is a mixed team of Donghua and Lianyi, so their strength is not weak. The match between the two teams will be a fierce battle.</p>
<h3>Two Charities Jointly Hold a Charity Soccer Match</h3>
<p>The Nanshi Xin Puyu Hall and the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital, two charitable organizations, are jointly holding a charity soccer match, inviting the Hualian team and a Western team to compete. The match is scheduled to be held at the Yiyuan Stadium on Xianyang Road at 5:30 PM on the 30th of this month. Tickets are divided into two types: 200 yuan and 400 yuan. All proceeds will be used to fund the two charitable organizations. Hualian is based on the Donghua team, with other outstanding Chinese players added. The Ciyou Society band will also come to the scene to play music to add to the fun.</p>
<h3>Youth Sports Department Holds Opening Ceremony</h3>
<p>The former Western Youth Association at 150 Jing'an Temple Road has now been converted into an army dormitory. The Youth Sports Department was established inside, and the opening ceremony was held at 2 PM on (24th). More than a hundred people attended, including representatives from the Xingya Baoguo Society, the Huazhong Zhenxing Society, the Army Deng Corps, and guests from various fields. First, Chida delivered the opening speech, followed by a speech by guest Yabuki Atsushi. Then, swimming performances and guest competitions began. The sports department's swimming pool is now open to new members, and those interested can apply to the department.</p>
<p>Shucheng Cup Small Ball Tournament Results Yesterday, six Shucheng Cup small soccer league matches were held at the Jiangning Road Stadium.

<p>First Small Ball League News The registration for the first small ball league organized by the Shanghai Small Ball Federation closed yesterday. There are as many as 180 participating teams. The league is scheduled to open next month. The league committee will be convened soon to discuss the competition matters and group arrangements.</p>
