<p>社評</p>
<h3>戰時敎育</h3>
<p>戰時教育，就是應付目前戰時必需的特殊教靑。戰時教育的原則就在竭力擴充一切直接與戰爭有關的學科，同時儘量減少一切與戰爭無關或間接有關的科目。這樣，使學校的助力人力集中，使學生們的精力集中，使國家在戰爭時期能夠大量的增加人才。戰時教育實施的方法就在一方面增加理工科學程和學校，一方面減少文法科學程和學校，槃邦日本所計劃的文三理七的比例，以及遂漸改進的方法，更足我們倣效。</p>
<p>從平時教育轉變到戰時教育，需要詳細的研究，鄭重的考慮，必須先定整個計劃，然後規定時期，促其實現。在這整個計劃內，有乞點應當特別注意：　規定重點，不要在一個地方有重複的設施，　充實試騐室，不要把教育限於課堂裹面的講授。</p>
<p>第一點所說的就是希望充分利用環境，戰時教育以理工科為先，理工科處處和全國的農工業有關。農業發達的地方方才可以辦農業事校，同時在這個農業發達的區域內的農業舉校應當集中起來，共同訓練學生，而不應當重複而分散，浪費精力。就上海而言，上海可算得全國輕工業的重心，輕工業的種類很多，我們就可依照各門，分設各種專業學校。現在上海各大學的工科很多，學生人數亦很多，可是造就出來的人才怎樣，是否能夠供給國家社會需要，上海教育界和工業界大士都可以很坦白地說一個「不」字。最大的原因就在重複，因為重複，人力財力都分散了，教育的效果亦自然減少目。前最要複的合併起來，醫如普通工程學科，某一校專辦機械工程科，某一校專辦電氣工程科，某一校專辦土木平程科，某一校專辦化學工業的奪科，某一校專辦紡織工業的專科等等。我們不希望大家辦「包羅世象，大而無當」的大學，我們只希望大家實事求是的辦一二所專科學校，這樣集中起來，一切都經濟，敎學的效果自然增高。最近中央毅然的停辦杭州浙江大學，更值得贊許。</p>
<p>第二點所說的，在平時已經很重要，在戰時更須立即實行。因爲理工科是實騐的學問，決不能只靠幾本教科書。中國經戰亂之後，軍校實騐室的設備有的已經燬壞了，有的因陋就簡的敷衍門面。我們主張集中，而集中之後就要充實設備。譬如辦電氣工程學校，先把各校個別的設備集中起來，可以利用的儘量利用，不足的就得立刻補充，補充設備的經費萬萬不能夠節省，所謂「工欲善其事，必先利其器」，沒有敎育的工具，一定敎不出優秀的人才，今天在實騐設備上多化一些錢，日後在應用人才上多得一分益。戰時不辦學校則已，如果要辦，必得要辦一個像樣的學校。</p>
<p>集中學校，充實設備，二者有連帶關係，要同時實行，我們願意把這個意見貢獻給當局，做草立整個計劃時的參考。</p>
<h3>日五島大臣廣播增強海上運輸力　並集中全力從事軍需生產</h3>
<p>東京一日中央社電　日運輸通信省大臣五島氏，一日夜廣播，說明運輸通信事業之全貌，就中對造船問題及海運事業，曾說明如次：海運乃現時重要產業之一，故當力圖其建造之圓滑，因之各重要港澤工事之建築，船舶運輸能率之提高，船員之確保，均為常局苦心經營者。船舶之建設，無論鋼鐵船或木造船，均當置重點，油糟船之建造，由最近之造船成績觀之，實有龐進之良好現象，更有遠鴛於德·英造船率之趨勢，此實為力量雄摩所致者。去年度之運輸實績，因有種種條件限制，給果較既定之運輸計劃量減少若干，但至去年末以後，由於講求機器帆船之非常動員，船舶謎衛之強化及航海日數之縮短，碼頭工人勞力之加強等各種方策，故至今年大體可按所計劃實施之。再者，關於海運力之充實問題，建造船舶因為根本條件，但船員之確保亦與船舶之建造同為增強海運力所不可或缺者，故船員待遇之改善及其家族之補助，常為先決問題，倘如此，則船員得以充實，服務精神得以昻揚，當可收獲增強海上運輸力之結果也。</p>
<p>東京一日中央社電　日本為集全力於軍需生產方面，前曾數次轉用纖維工業之工廠設備，現對殘存工廠勵行日夜交班工作，延長作業時間，確保勞務資材之供給，藉以增進工作效能及生產量。又棉織工業此次有七千工廠澈底合併，以確立棉織工業之生產責任體制，中小工廠之生產健全，一方飛機生產材料巴鋁及礬地，目下在朝鮮開採，已有顯著成績，此等資源如加以確實之活用，則足以供給一切輕金屬之需要，朝鮮總營府正舉全力從事此種事業。</p>
<h3>日空軍　襲衡陽梁山　擊毀敵機六十餘架</h3>
<p>東京一日中央社電日大本營六月一日下午二時半發表，中國方面日航空部隊，於五月二十九日三十日兩日，曾襲擊衡陽，及梁山兩敵飛機場。計擊毀及炸毀敵大型機二十架，小型機四十二架，以上日機全隊安然飛返。（又電）日軍精銳轟作機隊五月卅深夜，對梁山敵機塲連續襲擊，計擊毀及炸毀敵大小型機達四十三架，日軍轟炸機隊精銳，利用夜間明月飛抵該機場後，即將該機場滑走路首先炸毀。冒敵之對空砲火，對地上之敵機羣，實行轟炸，當即使其大型機四架，小型機九架起火，更學毀大型機十架，小型機二十架以上，合計擊毆敵機總數達四十三架，日機全隊安然飛返。又同時於二十九日夜出發之另一隊，飛抵衡陽上空後，即將敵機場滑走路周邊地帶炸毀，並擊毀小型機二架後，安然返防。又於二卞九日夜間之轟炸衡陽戰果，於事後偵察結果，已判明學毀其大型機五架，小型機十一架，擊毀大型機一架，合計擊毀敵機十七架。</p>
<p>收獲戰果安返基地</p>
<p>漢口一日中央社電日軍精銳部隊於二十五日廳襲渝軍根據地第九區戰區長沙，更於廿七日及廿九日夜間，分別急襲老河口渝軍陣地及衡陽機塲，當炸毀渝機十七架。又卅日夜日轟炸機隊復轟炸川省梁山機塲，猛炸歷一小時之久，炸毀大型機十架，小型機二十餘架，並使其大型機四架小型機九架起火燃燒。同時該轟炸機隊復空襲衡陽，當轟毀停置機塲之小型機二架，於此美空軍由桂朴及其他方面所結集之前進基地飛機，巳因日軍之猛轟而亦潰減。渝軍之企圖亦已被完全粉碎，現計駐渝美空軍之被擊毀者已達百分之十強，今日轟炸機隊更相繼飛臨梁山機鑷，對其滑走路投下巨彈，並以機場為中心，縱橫活躍，於東側。東北。西北及北方各地，對敵軍之機場霉作俯面轟炸，投娜必中巨彈，故敵機場已化為火海，此時僅有敵戰鬥機一架騰起，然瞬即倉惶遁去。其陸上防空砲火亦僅有機關砲一門，尚在射擊，但後由於日機之急襲，亦似沉默。日機炸毀敵機四十三架以上，收獲輝煌戰果，一並全部安返基地云。</p>
<h3>本報在京　舉行觀宴　介紹佐佐木博士</h3>
<p>南京一日中央社電上海申報·新聞報··主辦之戰時學術講座，請講師佐佐木博士舉行學術演講。申報為將博士介見於首都盤業學專家與新聞界，舉行歡宴，到十餘人。首由中報劉漢儒代表該報致詞，繼由佐佐木致詞，午後開始座談，由佐佐木博士與各濃業專家參加。博士報告日本現行濃業增產，及各校農學院教學近況，彼此交換意見，七時始散。（又訊）佐佐木博士定二日往農場參觀，於三日赴蘇。</p>
<h3>油化橡膠人造牛乳日科學家研究成功</h3>
<p>東京一日中央社電東亞燃料研究所，最鍬研究以生橡膠製造飛機燃料及飛機用發揮汕又告成功。據稱：喪失南方橡膠責源後之敵美，刻正研究人造橡膠，日本之橡膠資源豐富，除利用其本來之特質外，並將之化成汕質，以供科學戰爭之需要。東亞燃料研究所之汕化橡膠，全部由於日人研究所得。據外國研究之結果，此種獨創之汕術精神，寶乃日木科學實力之表現也。</p>
<h3>必阿克島美軍　被迫近海岸　達姆方面敵亦遭急襲</h3>
<p>東京一日中央社電必阿克島之日軍精說，目上月二十七日晨起，即痛烈邀擊於該島登陸之美軍，因之連日展開激戰。魯斯內克方面，敵軍主力部隊登陸地點之海岸地帶，乃長約七哩至入哩之絕崖，敵軍等即在此絕應斷璧與駭浪驚濤相挾之地膩中蠢動。日軍始終利用有利地形，連日夜襲敵軍，卒將敵軍迫向近岸之處，自五月三十日至現在止，收容之敵屍體已越二千具之多，日軍傷亡者僅三十人。敵軍曾企圖奪取摩伊克梅爾方面日軍機場，由於日軍之攻擊，已開始退卻，蓋欲集給於摩伊克梅爾之東方。</p>
<p>瑞典京城一日中央社電西南太平洋反軸心軍司令部發表：美軍於新幾內亞之北必阿克鳥登陸。據路透電：美軍於該鳥登陸前，曾以砲射擊該烏東南岸，並曾以轟炸機大編隊，猛炸該島東南岸，但當美軍在該蠢登陸時，裝戰登陸美軍艦艇，曾遭日軍沿怯砲火之猛烈轟擊。受創簽重。美軍在該島登陸後，復因日守軍之強烈抵抗，死傷甚眾。</p>
<p>東京一日中央社電　南太平洋某基地電，新幾內亞惟藤爾密方面日軍，二十七日曾急襲達姆方面之敵軍，敵軍棄屍三百。又該方面敵軍約八百人，因不堪日軍之猛攻，遂於是日下午分乘舟艇十隻，向對岸逃去。</p>
<h3>農業增產會　推進工作</h3>
<p>南京一日中央社電邇來食糧問題頗為各方所　祕，記者為明瞭本年度濃業增產情形起見，特走訪行政院農業增產策進委員會負責人，承談如下：本年食糧增產業經本會訂定各項具體辦怯，積極推進。現各有關機關及各地方政府，均在同一步調下，共策進行，以期增產工作能達到預定之收效。現在各項辦法推行均極為順利，尤其各省市縣區等下層增產團體，能體察政府增產意旨，努力負責實際增產任務，成績非常圓滿。目前本會對於增產工作，洽重於指導及獎屬之種選擇指導，合式秧田之提倡，耕作技術施肥存積治螟等之指導，及農具之改善，與辦理示範農場，及特約濃家等事項。關於獎勵方面，如荒田開墾，閒地利用，稻作栽培，選種秧田，品評除螟除稗除荒，及硫安配給等之獎勵事項，均在分別積極推進。深信木年度食糧增產成績，定有飛躍之發展。現關於食糧收買工作，有關當局已表示，對於收買方法，予以適當之調整，今年食糧增產工作，自常更趨圓滑。</p>
<h3>華北日人　參加重點產業</h3>
<p>北方一日中央社電北平日本大使館事務所常局，爲謀重要產業方面人員之充足，藉謀戰力增強起見，曾於三月一日，制定「勞力等臨時調整規則」，公布施行。此次依該規則第四條之規定，特指定日歡百人，參加重點產業方面。此次人員選定，完全由各總領事館領事館，由各志願者中選出，事前均經本人同意，與已往之微用則完全不同。</p>

<h3>印兵萬餘名　歸向日軍</h3>
<p>東京一日中央社電德國新聞社訊，據仰光消息：受英人強迫招募之印度兵土，巳有一萬五千人歸向日軍，此等印兵以及大學生等，均即望加人江特拉鮑斯所領導之印度國民軍。</p>
<h3>甘地仍堅主　逐出英國</h3>
<p>里期本一日中央社電據孟買電，甘地五月三十日曾致面印度政界權威資亞加爾，內容如次：印度國民會議派，一九四二年八月曾決議將英國逐出印度，余至今仍無拋棄此種決意之意向，蓋此項決議猶如吾之生命故也。余今雖被釋放，但余毫無快慰之感，反覺為恥辱，印度國民雖對余寄有莫大期待，但英當局或將於余健康恢復時，再度將余拘入獄內。</p>
<h3>義大利中路　後衛戰激烈</h3>
<p>柏林一日中央社電海通社軍事訪員塞托留斯稱：義錢西翼戰事，愈那發展為爭奪阿爾巴尼山之苦戰，該山現仍由德軍掌握，予反軸心軍進攻羅馬以極大阻碍。自星期一以來，敵軍自南方睛東雨方，正面進攻德軍山地陣綫。同時，並於阿爾巴尼山與海岸間地區迅急進軍，冀得包抄該地，結果餘遭遇重大人力犧牲外，一無所獲。英軍在沿海區進攻阿地亞兩側，亦無如何成就。內地方面，反軸心軍以大軍進攻康坡萊奧奈與拉魯維奧綫，被阻於阿爾巴尼山脈之南麓。星期二日反軸心軍共出動坦克車二百輛，損失七十入輛。中路新戰綫，近日僅有後衛活動，德軍依照預定計劃，從事撤退，因敵軍自東追踪進逼，並迭圖自南面包抄德軍斷後行動，後衛戰遂時趨激烈。萊匹尼山脈方面，敵軍利用山谷公路，進攻該南脊，德軍後衛部隊節節抵抗，屢阻進攻之魔洛薔軍，該軍最後雖得抵達卡匹秦死，但只及全程之半，再北，英第八軍之前鋒，在佛洛西洛奈區被娘軍保安隊所阻，邁爾法河發源處與里利河上游中間地區，亦有劇戰，德軍後衛且戰且却，予紐西蘭軍及波蘭軍以重大損失。至於前在亞平寗中部作戰之德軍，其避離行動亦得達成。據印緬前綫傳來的消息，最近緬前綫傳來的消息，最近阿拉千山岳地帶的戰塲，連日有　雨和雷雨，濡濕了征士的戎衣，不禁令人發印緬的雨季即將降臨之感。雨中作戰的困難，自不待覓。不過現在的驟雨和曾雨，是因為南西季節風遝來多量雨水所致，所謂雨季，乃另有所指。南方特有的季節，——雨季，在印緬方面，自六月底七月初開始，在說明以前，必先知道印緬一般的氫象。</p>
<h3>印緬作戰與雨季</h3>
<p>乾燥季的吿終</p>
<p>冬季時候，亞洲大陸所發生高氣壓，不斷向氣壓低的南部流動。這種北風，在日本國內東北，北陸方面降雪，關東方面起風，在印緬方面，則以孟德蘭為中心的伊拉瓦底河流域的平原，送來一碧無雲，淸涼純凈的空氣。這種所謂緬甸的秋季氣候，自十一，十二月起，繼媲至一月，此後溫度逐漸增高，到了二月三月間，有日陰處，也有超過四十度炎熱，長時期的乾燥繼續着。使平原化為沙漢的狀態’空氣混濁。這十一，十二，一月的冷涼期，和二月，三月的酷署期，都算為乾燥季。待三月終了，阿蘸姆北部方面，　霧閉給之日居多，不久阿拉干，巴特卡，瓊等山岳地帶，開始發生雷雲，雷雲化為雷雨，自南部順序往北部降落。此種雷雨，助最近印緬前綫所報告的雨，次數雖多，自午後落至傍晚，約一兩小時即止。初期雨量稀少，但伴有疾風，二十公尺的風速，數見不鮮。比及五月，風勢減弱，反之雨量增加起來，每天有三十公分乃至五十公分的豪雨，使溪流上所架的小橋，都被沖倒。</p>
<p>眞正的雨季</p>
<p>印緬入於此種狀態時，氣象即變為夏天光景。是即冬季逆性的氣壓使印度洋方面高的，大陸內部低的一切季節風，實行交替。正在這交替前，印緬方面頻頻受起自孟拉灣，北上的旋風的襲擊。此種旋風在內南洋發生颶風，在墨西哥灣，澳洲北海也發生颶風，同樣是在南北風系變紀不定時所發生的。這是南西季飾風的預告，自此而後，印緬進入眞止的雨季。南西季節風自六月底經七月八月九月，從印度洋向西南方吹去，故此期關，印度洋多風雨，加以風在前進中捲去此種海面的濕氣，故阿薩姆，阿拉干，台那養姆的高地，受豪雨的發襲，雨勢之猛烈，非日木等地所可想像。阿薩姆南面的邱拉蓬基，降雨量居世界第一，一天降雨二百公分的紀錄，絕木稀罕。據向來的觀測，海岸地帶，七，入月的雨鍬，每月平均超過一千公分，現在戰場的巴特下出脈，阿拉千山脈等雨量多的山岳地帶，其雨季狀態，絕非可以想像者。南西季節風人九月漸次減弱，不久南北風系再度交替，乾燥李開始，十月間又發生與六月同樣的旋風，共次數寗較六月為多。</p>
<p>印緬氣象一覽</p>
<p>以上為印緬方面氣象的概觀，速日豪雨結果，地面泥濘，河川大多泛濫，地上的機動戰遭受妨害，戰局是否將陷於膠着狀態，尚難　料。</p>
<p>作戰的困難</p>
<p>至於飛機欲飛越積亂雲連綿的高山祟嶺，非常困難，轟炸機到達日的地上空，因雲層遮掩，絕難準確轟炸，戰果亦不易辨認。所以敵我雙方，必須在雨季降臨前，出死力以爭，這是該戰綫的特質。但雨季也並非使戰爭全部停止。戰事沉寂期間，可以充實守備，而施設部鰍及輸送部隊仍不斷活躍。從事補給戰。大隊飛機雖不能出動，但少數飛機可以出動作游擊戰。與此游擊戰相關的，即積極利用此一季節，乘敵之慮，出奇制勝，亦在考慮之中。（譯自每日新聞）</p>
<h3>保加利亞德軍　迅速進展中　傳蘇將開始軍事行動</h3>
<p>沮利克一日中央社電安加拉來電稱：土悄息靈通者謂，蘇聯當局鑒於保加利亞德軍隊迅速進展，保軍亦隨之傾向反蘇，故蘇軍或將於六月二十五日前開始軍事行動。</p>
<p>沮利克一日中央社保加利亞政情似仍極不安，雖無可靠情報，但據德方消息，新保加利亞國民同盟已與當局協力，編組武裝部隊，討伐反對份子。同時奪謀總長魯加西已就任教育總監，其繼任參謀總長特琉奧諾已就職。又據安加拉電稱：國會議長卡爾法夫，前曾着手籌組親德內閣，但因蘇聯之威嚇，深恐保。蘇國交斷絕，遂作罷論，德方亦因保國內亂頻仍，兼之士耳其接近反軸心陣營關係，對其實力之行使，頗有裹足不前之勢。</p>
<p>柏林一日中央社電德外交當局就保加利亞政情，仍抱冷靜熊度，蘇聯對保國之嘔迫雖極顯著，但素持沉着態度之保加利亞國民，絕不致放棄其既定方針。德外交當局對記者團之質問，僅調保加利亞要人既無訪德之預定，故最近數週內，絕無該事賞。</p>
<h3>土外長　返安加拉</h3>
<p>安加拉一日中央社電土耳其外長曼里卓格魯，週三返抵安加拉，氏前赴斯丹埠小作勾留，土總統伊斯美現尙留該地。</p>
<p>安加拉一日中央社電塞特爾氏在唐報以「英人對土之要求爲何」爲題，對英報所發表之論文有所指摘，丘吉爾首相係要求土國完全停止對德輸出，供給反軸心以軍事基地及土國儘速念戰。該文作家稱：彼熟知英國避免流血之傳統希望，士國雖希望戰爭　速結束，但不能以土人之血換得之，英報之言論，絕對不能改　土國之觀點，而土耳其亦不能　應丘吉爾之要求。</p>

<h3>衛生運動大會　昨隆重開幕　民衆熱烈參加盛況空前</h3>
<p>本市衛生運動大會及衛生展覽會，前經主管衛生常局積極籌備，於昨日上午九時，假座本市靜安寺路大光明大戲院舉行開幕典禮，牌況空前，茲將昨日大會情形，分述如下：上午十時青少年團保甲長，以及各長官等皆准時出席，開冪後，由主席陳市長代表領導行禮如儀，即席報告籌備經過，並說明七天內之各種活動，勗勉各保甲長努力督促實行，以維公眾健康，旋由梁處長等相繼演說，闡明衛生與國家社會關係之密切，希望市民切實注意，演說畢即由各長官領導於靜安寺路一帶舉行大描除，至跑馬應內攝影後，參觀衛生展覽會，盛況實為空前所未有。晚八時廿五分該會為噢起市民普遍重視公北衛生起見，由陳市長假座大上海電羣廣播演講。茲將市長演詞照錄如下。。</p>
<p>陳市長廣播詞</p>
<p>今天是本市衛生運動大會開始展開活動的一天，關於衛生運動的意義，今天在開會的時候，有許多專家撰稿，對於衛生運動的軍要，已經銳得穠明暸，大槪都能明白了，用不着吾再我說了，不過吾覺得有一點大家要注意的，彭是淸潔衛生，一般人都知道它的重要，而不去實行，這賞在缺乏素養的綠故，吾們不但耍知道並且要有恒心地實行，等到養成習慣以後，就自然而然的賓踐了。舉一個例子來說：吾們每每到了乾凈的地方，就會乾凈起來，到了骯　的地方，也就骯　起來’就拿吐痰這件事來說吧，有些人在外國的時候，是不會隨地吐痰，可是回到中國來，就隨地亂吐，這就是缺乏素養的緣故，衛生要從家庭方面開始，所以希望做父母的要使嬰兒自小就養成淸潔的習慣，長大以後身體才能強健。痰裏面含有許多細菌，能夠由灰塵或蒼娜傳染，而使市民患着肺癆病，這個原理明白的人也不見得少，然而還有許多人好像只要把痰不吐在室內，不吐在地板上就好了，至於吐在大門外，好像不要緊的，其實吐在大門外一樣的嬰傳染，所以吾們不僅要注意們人衛生，同時還要顧到公眾衛生，那就非有素養和習慣不可了，做父母的，應當知道的。有了健全的體格，比錢還要好，尤其是在這大東亞戰爭的階段，國家須要增加生產，如果國民體格不健全，增加生產無從談起，再進一步而言，國民都有常兵的義務，沒有強健的身體，是不行的，吾國的壯了，經過體格檢杳的統計，只有百分之六及格，這傎是國家重大的損失，有人批評中國的軍隊卽不能打勝仗，又不能打敗仗，這話什公解釋呢？因爲打了勝仗，須向前跑，但由於體格不強健，往往把飯襄背袋都丟了，打敗使的話，那更不得了，簡直把槍都拋掉了，這到並不是戰們知識和作成力的不夠，實在是體力的不夠。所以不健康的人，不但不能享禮利也不能盡義務，所以大家要知道衛生的重要，並且要切實術生習慣，不要違反衛生道德，尤共是做父母的人，要密切注意嬰兒健康，教養衛生習慣，這是本人十二萬熱忱，盼望全體市民切實實行。</p>
<p>廣播演講節目</p>
<p>上海特別市衛生局，爲衛生運動大會，特自昨（一日）晚起舉行隔行運動廣播演講。昨日晚八時二十五分，由袁衛生局長代表陳市長演講「大上海的衛生建設」，今晚同時仍由袁局長廣播「衛生運動之意義」，其他廣撚演講節目，業已排定，探誌如下：三日晚由宜傳處梁處長演講「夏令衛生的重要」，四日晚由中國紅十字會顏福慶博士講「預防疾病與治療疾病之價值，五日由醫師公會顧南羣，六日由法語醫學會楊士達擔任，七日由方侃廣播上海肺結核猖獗情形及其預妨方案，時間均為晚八時二十五分至三十五分，命市市民注意收聽。</p>
<h3>一區工務處　注意公共淸潔　取締違章建築</h3>
<p>本市第一區轄境內各項淸潔工作，如洗掃道路，疎導陰溝，出除垃披，及糞便等，均由工務處負責主持，並列為該處最重要之工作，其專司是項工作之職工迷數千餘人，俱朋經騐豐富，且能克苦耐勞，誠以此項淸潔工作，有關公眾衛生，故不論天時業境，從未一日間斷，最近對於滬西閘北等新併區域內淸潔工作，正在積極整頓，前八區淸潔工作，亦正辦理接收，行見行政統一，效率增強，造福市民，當非淺妙。</p>
<p>區內公私建築，工務處向有規定，限制頗巖，事鏘以來，，行政組織幾經變遷，新舊交替之際，管理容有駑弛，遂致違章建築，乘機勃興，殊與市民安全衛生及市容方面，發生莫大影響，此種現象，尤以滬西區發現最多，甚致浜溝淤塞，造成滬西積水之最大原因，刻工務處對於是項連章建築，已在嚴厲取締，並設派減除滬西水患。</p>
<p>設意見箱</p>

<h3>迅籌救急之方</h3>
<p>日來本市沐價黑市，批搖直上，日前公佈「上海市民食米管理暫行辦怯」以後，一般人更憂疑揣測，米價黑市送益形紊亂。現距新米登場，尚有三個月時間，亟盼關係各方迅籌救念之方，以安人心。我們再作獻議如次：</p>
<p>從速公佈搬運護照請領手續，力求簡單。目前一般運輸頗為困難，如領照手續複雜遲綏，則益難濟急。</p>
<p>儲米倉庫力求普過指定，人庫出庫手續力求簡捷。或在入庫磅騐時即將征購數量扣除，另行堆存，不相混雜，較為便利。</p>
<p>儘早公布征購價格，及合法市價，俾商民知所遵循，頭躍採運，以暢來源。</p>
<p>各米糧搬入口，檢問人員及護照處職員，嚴格選用，絕對公正廉潔。</p>
<p>不須護照及不征購之最低數量，至少規定為一石以內，以利自由搬運。</p>
<p>最後，願當局嚴切注意，米價黑市之紊亂，足以影響一般物便，重苦大衆。在此安定民生之要求中，務必有效遏制米價，穩定一般物價。</p>

<h3>南太平洋前綫　補給部隊殲敵記</h3>
<p>以大內少尉為艇除長的二艘發動艇與一艘武裝小發動艇，筆直向着摩茲比那岬航行。晴期的天空，沒有月亮，星兒在閃閃地眨着眼。爪哇灣的波浪是平靜的。他們一路向着基地念駛，從〇〇到〇〇共經六十五哩，在秘密航行中盡着運輸的任務。那時候，突然有二聲長長的呌笛聲。那是知道有魚恰艇出現的呌悄聲。武裝艇艇長大塚　長，在右舷四十度，約六百公尺的前方，發見敵影了。一艘，兩艘，三艘……五艘的敵魚雷艇，在黑夜裹，蹴浪而來。招呼「準備交戰」的大塚艇，向右大轉灣。砲長平江兵長靜靜地瞄準着敵第二艇。一步一步近前，「發射」的號令一下，同時，速射砲彈拖簽紅色的尾巴飛向敵絡二艇去。第一彈就打中腹部，火焰映紅了關爿海。</p>
<p>拚死先制攻擊</p>
<p>敵第四艇用快速力衝來爲其友艇復仇。機槍手淵上被敵彈擊中倒下了。高橋軍曹奪過了槍柄，噠噠……發出了比前更密的子彈。敵第四艇負傷欲掉頭而逃，敵野村一等兵射中了一彈，在百五十公尺的前面，沈沒下去了。</p>
<p>已經打沈了二艘敵魚雷艇的大塚艇之士氣，愈加振奮。大內少尉的一艘，護武裝艇去戰鬥，自己祇顧繼續向基地　進。此時，大塚艇的右舷，有一艘敵指揮艇模樣的，左舷，有一艘敵三號艇，冒着強烈砲火衝來。可惜，右舷尾部中了二彈，左舷首部中了一彈，穿成大空。海水汩汩地浸入。但浸水算得了什麼，水雖已齊胸，還是向敵五號艇迫近前去。</p>
<p>正在這千鈞一髪的　間。兩舷相距僅十五公尺，突然大塚艇長手裏所握的手槍發令了。全體打成一片，躍向敵魚雷艇去。五號艇趁勢逃走，三號艇也放起彈慕，向海岸遁去</p>
<p>可是大塚艇已有了三個砲彈皮，幾支重機槍，浸水一刻一刻地增加。以前，遇到這種事情，大塚艇長也是命令拋錨登陸，火砲雖然悄滿了戰士的鮮血，但全部無損。立誓欲在明天的戰鬥中復仇的大塚艇長，一定欲火砲都搬到岸上。就在那時候，迫近頭上的是敵機的轟聲。接牆，投下二發照明彈，四周照得竟如白畫。在明晰的天空下，大塚艇浮上米了。武遝在於我方，投下的三發炸蟬，都無大礙，全體不由得大呼萬歲，不久，火砲安全上陸了。</p>
<p>但戰鬥並未終止。不到一星期，敵又出動了魚雷十五艘以上，飛機五艘以上，黑夜出擊，來遮斷我補給路。那天的戰鬥下干五時發生在加塞列灣。</p>
<p>進藤隊以北澤少尉為艇長的四艘潑動艇與一艘武裝小發動艇，為坦任〇〇運輸工作，等待黑夜裹向〇〇妯發。</p>
<p>出發後不久，塌田艇的機械部發生障礙，立那投繫繩住西崎艇，一面曳行而航，一面修理。但這時候有二艘敵魚雷艇前來出擊。北澤艇的隊長立即命令開砲。交戰約十分鐘，敵人被擎退。第二次的出擊是七時二十分。敵魚雷艇二艇向曳航着堀田艇的武裝小發動艇挑戰。我武裝艇切斷了曳航索，準備應戰，先制攻擊為戰勝之鍵，我武裝艇首先開火，向敵魚雷艇肉搏。敵人望風而遁。最後，祗像放屁般放了一排機槍，有一彈命中我武裝艇的腹部。</p>
<p>北澤艇隊長不得巳將武裝艇與崛田艇留在後面，腦着三艘發動艇向〇〇急駛，然而那裹正在火燒，加以風大浪狂，登陸是木可能的。</p>
<p>悽慘的白刃戰</p>
<p>掉轉艦首一看，敵魚當艇二艘不是正向我開火嗎？更於我們不利者，愈接近〇〇河岸，愈成為敵轟炸機的目的物，不住的在頭上打旋。北澤艇隊長隱忍不動，覷機來減敵人。照明彈照耀得如同白　，仔訓看時，有幾艘魚雷艘扼守簽我去路。敵轟炸機開始用機槍掃射，武裝艇亦發出了對空戰鬥的第一彈，同時，向前面最右翼的魚雷艇舉三艘突擊。海的白刃戰以重心向着敵第一艇，砲火向該艦集中，將其擊沈（翔譯自五月十七日西部朝日新聞）</p>
<h3>地圖說明</h3>
<p>軸心陣綫，反軸必陣綫在亞歐兩大淵上的戰塲中，戰雲密佈，大有山雨欲來風滿樓之勢。印細戰綫的伊姆法爾包圍圈，使英美所希望的奪還緬甸以造成對日攻勢的野心，遭受挫折。英國被迫從攻勢改取守勢。美國在中南太平洋的攻勢，雖遇日軍在內南洋的堅固防衛，亦冀用空炸來遂其侵攻的野心。而在歐洲方面，德軍嚴陣以待的歐洲要塞，英美即獎對之展開第二戰綫。是經亞歐主要戰塲的動向，頗堪注意（圖見下方）</p>

<h3>三年</h3>
<p>— 夢泓</p>
<p>時間像巨輪樣地輾轉，但決不是循環，它只是向前，轉過了暑夏，轉過了嚴冬，又帶來了春底溫暖，人們都跌進在初春的暖意里，笑着，狂　　。。</p>
<p>懷了顆酸辛的心，忍受着生活的艱困，痛苦地挨過了這悠長的歲月，已經整整的三年，生活的創痛把我的知覺都麻木了，　噬着剩下的靑春底殘渣，再沒有勇氣與生活搏鬥，一個昔日命運的叛逆者現在竟順受着命運的支配，一切在我的面前都顯得那樣地平淡，煩俗，瑣碎，無聊……</p>
<p>近鄉新墓前留下的錫錠遣跡，殯儀館門口那些穿着素衣，手携祭物的人們提醒我已經是淸明掃墓的季節。素衣，白帶，紙錠……這一切都促我揭開了回憶的帷幕。</p>
<p>三年前戰爭的火焰蔓延到近海的N縣，那時我正在N縣中里唸書，琳本是在S城的省中高二，進學期也移到N縣中來唸，因為志趣相投，所以平時接觸的機會很多，當N縣戰雲密集的時候，我正患傷飄症臥倒在床上，縣中準備遷移，同學們都已回家的回家，跟着學校走的走了，留下的只是幾個沒家可回，沒地方可去的同學，於是我和侍候我病的琳也移到離城二十餘里的鄉下睦村去住。</p>
<p>在極度堅苦的生活下，我們每天二餐粥湯。二人袋裏所剩的總共只有二百元零幾個角子。</p>
<p>生活把我們融化了困苦，緊張，忿怒，思想……把我們連結成一個整體，我並不囚戰爭和病廣受到絲毫的苦惱，祟高的友情和偉大的希親就足以安慰我這點，每次看到琳無休止的工作，會使我感到不安與感激，對於一個同學她是夠辛苦的了。</p>
<p>她是憫外形矮小而結實皮膚呈淺褐色的南方姑娘，短到耳根的頭髮和二只大而靈活的眼顯示了她底聽　，徽眸的臉兒有薔二顆恰好大小的眉窩，並不算很美，但使人在她身上感覺到的是另一種親切地，和諧地，自然地氣息，尤其是那副挺好的嗓子，使同學都擁在她的周圍，她的名字因她的嗓子而響遍了全校，甚至別的學校也流傳着她的名字，當她被包國的時候，解救的辦法只有唱支歌兒。</p>
<p>偶然在她空閒的時候便會坐在我的床頭談關於將來的希望以安慰我這個高度的思鄉病患者，或者唱起她那夜鶯樣的歌曲，來轉換我愁　的心情，我愛着這些，並且是感激着她了給我這些。</p>
<p>沒有藥石醫治的倪寒症使我的病勢加重了，琳勸我立刻離開N縣到上海來，N縣因戰爭而成了非常不安寗，同時琳也太累了，所以我決定到上海來，然而琳仍留在N縣，為了兩個人的來往費用會更大，待病愈後我還是須回到N縣，來實現我們共同的希望。</p>
<p>一月底末稍，一個和暖的早晨，我預備動身了，前夜琳已替我的行李整理好了，叮囑了許多話，我知道牠道晚上沒有睡蒲，但又不敢驚醒我，恐怕疲乏，每次釀來總聽到她咳嗽和嘆息的聲音，心里感到有些難受，早晨配來時琳已把事情弄得很妥貼，此刻正坐在床邊呆茄，我想地也一定非常難受。</p>
<p>陽光很好，宇宙顯得那麼地充滿着生氣，呌了只船把我們送到E鉗去搭N縣城的小輪，再趁車到上海，E鎭的市面受了戰爭的影響很覺凄涼，我們在一個麵舖里吃了點束西，時間尚早，就坐在那里等小輪，因為要說的話太多，反而一句都說不出，大家默默地坐着，各人的心里都蘊藏着複雜的情感，直到船將開的時候，她才送我上船：「途中為心，別忘了時常來信，回來時帶點巧克力給我。騙她帶着笑臉說了這麼一句，聲音已有些哽咽，雖然我知道她的確很歡喜巧克力，但此刻她說這話的意思並不在那些，而是想使我忘卻分離的痛苦，我點點頭眼淚已經流在面傾上了，整整的一們冬月我感謝她這一個長時期底看護，五們月的柑處使我們變成像自家人一樣。</p>
<p>船老大在解　伸手給琳握了一下，鄱慶地緊但終於還是放鬆了，分手了：「安心吧！決不會忘了你的。」僅僅是幾們字但要我說出來是如何地困難，這聲音幾乎連自已都聽不見，然而琳鉛了解我的，小輸向河心移動，我站在甲板上向她行了個敬禮，噯，她笑了呢？這是應該的，幾天來牠一直沉驚臉沒有笑過，手里那方藍色底絹帕儘是舉在空中向我搖蕩，直到小輸轉彎時我還看見那個影子——那個永遠不能磨減的影子，我倒在艙房里哭了，痛快地哭，船上的人們都莫名其妙地投給我同情地眼光，我成了坡注意的中心。</p>
<p>到了上海，一連的給子琳六封信，但沒見有回音，二個月的修養恢復了健康，立刻買子一大盒巧克力和別的她需要的東西到鄉下去，在車上我幻想見而時的情絡，應該怎樣嚇地一嚇才有趣，我們將要來實現我們共同的希望。</p>
<p>陸村沒有琳在，村民告訴我的只是那麼一點點，但就這麼一點，宅已使我非常地哀慟。戰後的鄉村到處都是土匪，琳就是不接受土匪的要求而被暴徒以一柄利刃結束了她短短的靑春底生命。</p>
<p>我說不出琳是什麼日子死的，只知道她在三年前的也是現在時候死了，我更不知道她的尸體埋在什麼地方，只是在陸利我們住過的屋邊園地上我挖了一個窿窟，放進了那盒巧克力和琳需要底東西，用自己底手寫了塊木板——迫憶的所在：趙琳同學的紀念地——緊在　窟邊的土底下，如今已整整三週年了，安知這塊木扳是否還在原來的　窟邊？</p>
<p>三年來，在外邊流浪的生活，已把往事漸漸地沖淡了，但每次聽到別人的歌聲和哭聲，或其他白色底飄帶，紙錠以及足使感觸底物事的時候，我又常常會想起已往的事，一次，二次，三次……已經</p>
<p>回憶是甜密的，但回億過後的痛苦卻是難受的啊！</p>

<h3>「天從人願」觀後</h3>
<p>— 古辛</p>
<p>……一個女學生，在偶然的機會中認識了一位「英俊」的「作家」，種下了愛苗。可是女學生底父親是典型的老頑固，對他們底交往無意有意地作了種種阻碍，「好事多磨」。但最後終于給他們設法團圓了，雙隻脫離魔掌。額外的收擭，他們還成全了另外一對鴛鴦。——依然是這一類的故事。全片浪漫的氣息　過了寫實，除略對封建餘孽給予了一點　刺，無非　觀眾發洩幾聲極短暫極短暫的　笑。</p>
<p>……導演底靈感似乎不夠充汕，處理塲合靈巧的少，不足道的多。暈大的失收是剪　。情節缺乏合理的聯貫，此其一。剪輯對時間底支配不得富，此其二。提示火車前進的輪子轉動底鏡頭，每次　現得總嫌太久，太累　。湊出　人中問的暗場，一方而表示劇情底一個段落，一方面也讓觀眾成眼光轉移一下，沖淡渦丟的印象，再待專心接受新的畫面，，可以，而且很需要時間稍長一點。然而本片底導演似乎以為這是浪費，沒等前一景剛淡去，便忙不迭把下一塲跳進觀眾底眼簾了，他不知道這樣反足以促使觀眾底疲倦。至于悄節不迎貫，那是山于各節間少了幾個不必有的　頭的原故。</p>
<p>……按說，女學生陳明珠底心理該是相當複雜矛盾的，她有憂患，但仍不失大眞。胡楓沒有把她好好地刻劃出來，而導演也沒有給她定夠表露的鏡頭。巖俊的余方是一泣十足的牛奶作家，火東裊和陳明珠相識一場，那種兜搭挨近的動作，不但牛奶氣洋溢，簡直更摻有抖亂氣了。</p>
<p>……值得推許的，却是美明和殷秀岑分飾的兩個假迫學的親家翁。常兩下覓面時一陣鍬動的「君子式」的外交對話，風趣裏極盡了嘲弄。</p>

<h3>慶祝日海軍節　運動大會盛況總述靜端</h3>
<p>上海新開聯合會為慶祝日木海軍紀念節，特舉行盛大運動會，計有田徑賽及各項球類表演，於上月廿五日分別在三處舉行。各場觀衆均逾理想，盛況空前、迫記各場簡情。</p>
<p>第一運動塲田徑賽表演</p>
<p>第一運動場假跑馬廳舉行田祕賽表演，自下午二時起，觀眾達五萬人之多，儀式隆重，首由該會主席許力致開會詞。次由海軍武官近藤少將致詞，最後由李思浩給獎，直至暮色蒼茫始閉幕。</p>
<p>徑賽節目精彩百出</p>
<p>徑賽中以四百米最為引人入勝，十二人出發，前一百米時，不辨先後，百米後始見邱振富，獨佔鱉頭，談智能吳華年緊追於後，以達於終點。而徑賽中之萬米長跑，突破全國紀錄，實霹得意收穫，創紀錄者為啞吧樓文敖，成續卅三分五十六秒（全國紀錄保持者為孫澈，成績卅四分〇一，）觀樓文敖脚步輕鬆，姿勢亦稱優美，再努力前程，啞吧實無可限量。</p>
<p>田賽成績平平而已</p>
<p>各項田賽成績平平而巳，如李震中之跳高，王學武之標槍，均以無人競爭，不免稍見減色，否則或能有較好之成續覽生也。</p>
<p>第二運動塲聯誼勝三省</p>
<p>第二運動會假逸園於下午五時起舉行足球對抗，由三省出戰聯誼，准時交綏。上半時聯誼稍存輕敵之意，以蔣益門任後衛，陳效平任中衛，乃覺聯給方面，吃虧不少，然效平之個人表演極佳，腳頭淸脆，氣力亦充沛，大將之材也。三省乘人之危，上牛時竟以三對二勝聯誼，使聯誼諸將篷心吊胆。下牛時聯誼不得不調整陣容，竭力進攻，始見進退有序，述獲三球，以五對三克服三省。唯三省是役之表演，頗合初生之犢不畏虎之表演。上牛時之覓隙深入，威脅聯誼之鏡頭，誠有顯着之進境。三省隊經此聯賽後，確非季初時所可比擬矣。來日正長，尚願繼續努力。</p>
<p>第三運動塲華影最出色</p>
<p>第三運動場假西靑健身房於下午五時起，有乓乒女排球，男籃球三次表演。首為乓乒由聯誼戰坪琊，兩隊均披乓乒界第一流選手，結果聯誼以四對一大勝，節緒初表演最爲出神人化。繼為女子排球，華達出戰三省，論人材華達勝，然結果三省輕以二對零吿捷者，聯絡較勝也。最後爲籃球，首塲明星以四十一對四十勝白隊。最後中北華影對壘。華娜在此役中，表演非常優美，舒適高茫生均有意想不到之出色。中北乃滬上盟主，幾遭其毒手，結果三十七對三十五，中北倖勝一球而巳。</p>
<h3>津聯足球隊　初賽後觀感</h3>
<p>天津津聯足球隊，此次南來遠征，本定於上月十七日抵滬，後因西僑出境問題，致遭阻延。後經各方面之周旋，海上潘三省氏亦有助力。該隊終得於上月二十三日離津，二十四日晚上抵滬。一行十八人寓外難匯中飯店，在滬定比賽四場，首戰業己在前日三十一日與滬聯比賽，津聯隊戰績尚可，各一媾和，茲略作賽前戰後觀感如后。</p>
<p>賽前之估計</p>
<p>賽前一般球迷對津聯之估計甚低，有謂其來滬四戰，必成全車覆沒。蓋鑒於其究屬天時地利吃虧外，又為烏合之眾，豈能有所成就。待該隊蒞滬後，在跑馬廳試練時及與槍國隊作友誼賽。記者均往參觀，頗覺該隊對基木動作仍在注意中。其試練時仍用練跑，煞車，比快等。此傎為足球運動中之基本條件，照理凡球員確應始終加以此種練習，庶幾有充分發揮。（觀乎滬上各隊，極少此種練習。）自觀該鰍試練後，鄙人即斷其為足力充足，力求上進，而隊員除一二老將外，胥場後起之秀，故必有二番意外之收穫。記者亦尊專訪聯誼許文奎君，對該隊之估計。許君表示，滬聯之陣容，須鄭重考虛，否則不足以言勝利也。總之，賽前之估計津聯，實力中平，守門特佳，奈隊能奮勇到底，勝負則在絕對同守巾，似偶面進攻中之幸運如何而定。</p>
<p>初戰之印象</p>
<p>前日（三十一日）津聯　第一砲戰滬聯隊，一比一和局，津　隊不無略有偉運性及滬聯之反常，茲姑不作細論。且就津聯在此戰中予我之印象，約略紀述，一戰之談，當未能為定論也。</p>
<p>守衛力足變幻極少</p>
<p>其守門之技術，確屬上乘，毋容贅述。其五守衛取區域防衛術變幻極少以中堅之左右為進退，似甚機械化。唯五衛氣力極足，竭能盡力纏住敵鋒，似甚可取。如遇敵五鋒挺進，聯絡而入，略作小傳遞，則必將現顧此失彼之狀。其兩前衛雖前後兼顧，接濟前鋒，尚不能盡如人意，退後助守，更茫無所知。故該隊守衛係一種型式的區域固守法，（與籃球術中「Zone」守黎法相彷彿）。</p>
<p>攻取W式聯絡未熟</p>
<p>該隊進攻方法，完全想採用切膩。俟中鋒一得球，左右翼即及時猛奔，兩內鋒為助守及應用W式，當退後。唯該兩內鋒之奔波雖見賣力，惜乎在進攻時，退得略嫌稍遠。故要中鋒與兩翼問有最佳之聯絡而進製，實不可得。表面上翼鋒雖見銳利，終因缺少契默，未見有如何強旺之攻勢。</p>
<p>今後之預測</p>
<p>今日下午該隊戰東華，有謂東華士氣正旺，聲勢殊壯。然津聯隊第一砲即有優美收獲，其士氣聲勢，亦未必弱於東華也。故欲研究共勝敗者，應戰術方而耳。錄束華合作功夫，較津聯勝一籌，守衛方法，比較有變化。唯氣力似不盆遠茲。更足以顧忌者，那對方守門之佳。故我言，東華應勝，其唯一須考究者即如何破台而竇卡之門。余頗覺徒恃韓龍海一人之猛　，難奏成效。因津聯後衛動作極快，故應先由幼良衝上先作阻擋掩護，然後由籠海猛竄，易收破門也。</p>
<p>津聯與聯誼之戰，未敢加以臆斷，蓋雙方俱屬守優於攻，作風極有相似之點。最近聯誼遠征華北時，成績尚佳。對此守門，阿奎曾兩頂打破。故怪腳在此戰中如不失當態，必能顯出怪腿，一展我人耳目。況懶牛李義臣近況彌好，代表中華出席國際盃之梅開二度，麥尼蒂相警失色。綜此而觀，聯誼前鋒漸入蔗境，則聯誼似正常以往，亦可取得勝利</p>
<p>致津聯戰滬西聯，我謂津聯吃虧處極多。蓋是時津聯已連戰三仗，，難免不露疲態。而西聯以逸待勞，且賴觀察數戰之後，其球路漸能稔熟。管理馬山兒又善用智。是則復可以已長攻彼短。故西聯取勝，亦極有希望。</p>
<p>綜此三戰，津聯均有失敗之可能。所賴以挽回頹勢者，僅為守門之特佳及後衛中堅之夠得到，或能造威出奇制勝之局面。</p>

<h3>Wartime Education</h3>
<p>Wartime education refers to special education programs necessary for coping with the current wartime situation. The principle of wartime education lies in vigorously expanding all subjects directly related to warfare, while minimizing all subjects unrelated or indirectly related to warfare. This allows the concentration of assistance and manpower from schools and the concentration of students' energy, enabling the nation to increase talent significantly during wartime. The method of implementing wartime education involves increasing science and engineering programs and schools while decreasing arts and law programs and schools. Japan's planned ratio of three arts to seven science programs, along with its gradual improvement methods, is worthy of our emulation.</p>
<p>The transition from peacetime education to wartime education requires detailed research and careful consideration. An overall plan must be established first, followed by a specific timeframe for its implementation. Within this overall plan, several points deserve special attention: defining key areas to avoid redundant facilities in one location and enriching laboratories to avoid limiting education to classroom lectures.</p>
<p>The first point emphasizes fully utilizing the environment. Wartime education prioritizes science and engineering, which are closely related to the nation's agriculture and industry. Agricultural schools should be established where agriculture is developed, and these schools within the developed agricultural area should be centralized to train students collectively, avoiding redundant and dispersed efforts that waste energy. In Shanghai, for example, considered the light industry center of the country with numerous types of light industry, we can establish various specialized schools based on each field. Currently, many universities in Shanghai have engineering departments with a large number of students. However, whether the talent produced meets the needs of the nation and society is something that educational and industrial leaders in Shanghai can frankly answer with a "no." The main reason is duplication, which disperses human and financial resources, naturally diminishing the effectiveness of education. The most important thing is to merge what is duplicated. For example, instead of having general engineering departments, one school should specialize in mechanical engineering, another in electrical engineering, another in civil engineering, another in chemical engineering, and another in textile engineering, and so on. We do not want universities that are "all-encompassing and superficial;" we only want everyone to establish one or two specialized schools practically. This centralization would be economical, and the teaching effect would naturally increase. The recent resolute suspension of Hangzhou Zhejiang University by the central government is commendable.</p>
<p>The second point, already important in peacetime, needs to be implemented immediately in wartime. Science and engineering are experimental disciplines, and relying solely on textbooks is insufficient. After China's wars, the equipment in military school laboratories has either been destroyed or superficially maintained. We advocate centralization, and once centralized, the equipment must be enriched. For example, when establishing an electrical engineering school, the individual equipment of each school should be centralized first. Usable equipment should be utilized as much as possible, and deficiencies must be immediately supplemented. The funding for supplementing equipment must not be economized on. As the saying goes, "To do a good job, one must first sharpen one's tools." Without the tools of education, excellent talent cannot be cultivated. Investing more money in experimental equipment today will yield more benefits in the application of talent in the future. It is better not to run schools during wartime, but if schools are to be run, they must be run properly.</p>
<p>Centralizing schools and enriching equipment are interrelated and must be implemented simultaneously. We are willing to offer this advice to the authorities as a reference for drafting an overall plan.</p>
<h3>Minister Gotō Broadcasts on Strengthening Maritime Transportation Capacity and Concentrating All Efforts on Military Production</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) - Minister Gotō of the Ministry of Transportation and Communications broadcasted on the evening of the 1st, explaining the overall picture of the transportation and communications business. He specifically addressed the shipbuilding problem and the maritime transportation industry, stating the following: Maritime transportation is currently one of the most important industries, so we must strive for its smooth construction. Therefore, the construction of important port facilities, the improvement of ship transportation efficiency, and the securing of crew members are all issues that the authorities are diligently managing. Whether it is steel ships or wooden ships, the construction of ships must be given priority. Judging from recent shipbuilding achievements, the construction of oil tankers has shown a good phenomenon of rapid progress and is even trending towards surpassing the shipbuilding rate of Germany and England. This is due to our strong strength. Due to various restrictions, last year's transportation performance was slightly less than the planned transportation volume. However, since the end of last year, due to various strategies such as emphasizing the emergency mobilization of motorized sailing ships, strengthening ship escorts, shortening navigation days, and increasing the labor of dockworkers, this year's implementation can generally be carried out as planned. Furthermore, regarding the issue of enriching maritime transportation capacity, building ships is a fundamental condition, but securing crew members is equally indispensable to enhancing maritime transportation capacity as building ships. Therefore, improving the treatment of crew members and subsidizing their families are always the prerequisite issues. If so, the crew members can be enriched, the spirit of service can be uplifted, and the result of strengthening maritime transportation capacity can be harvested.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) - In order to concentrate all efforts on military production, Japan has repeatedly converted factory equipment in the textile industry. Currently, factories that remain are encouraged to work day and night shifts, extend working hours, and ensure the supply of labor and materials in order to improve work efficiency and production volume. In addition, 7,000 cotton textile factories have been thoroughly merged this time to establish a production responsibility system for the cotton textile industry and to ensure the healthy production of small and medium-sized factories. On the other hand, bauxite and vanadium, materials for aircraft production, are currently being mined in Korea, with significant results. If these resources are effectively utilized, they will be sufficient to meet all light metal needs, and the Korean Governor-General's Office is making every effort to engage in this undertaking.</p>
<h3>Japanese Air Force Attacks Hengyang and Liangshan, Destroying More Than 60 Enemy Aircraft</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) - Imperial Headquarters announced at 2:30 PM on June 1st that the Japanese air force in China attacked the enemy airfields in Hengyang and Liangshan on May 29th and 30th. A total of 20 enemy large aircraft and 42 small aircraft were destroyed or bombed. All Japanese aircraft returned safely. (Further report) A Japanese elite bomber squadron continuously attacked the enemy airfield in Liangshan late on May 30th, destroying and bombing as many as 43 enemy large and small aircraft. The elite Japanese bomber squadron used the bright moonlight at night to reach the airfield and first bombed the airfield's runway. Braving enemy anti-aircraft fire, they bombed the enemy aircraft groups on the ground, immediately causing four large aircraft and nine small aircraft to catch fire, and further destroying more than ten large aircraft and twenty small aircraft, totaling 43 enemy aircraft destroyed. All Japanese aircraft returned safely. At the same time, another squadron that departed on the night of the 29th reached the skies over Hengyang and bombed the area around the enemy airfield's runway, destroying two small aircraft before returning safely. In addition, as a result of a post-attack reconnaissance of the bombing of Hengyang on the night of the 29th, it has been determined that five large aircraft and eleven small aircraft were destroyed, and one large aircraft was damaged, totaling 17 enemy aircraft destroyed.</p>
<p>Achieving War Gains and Returning Safely to Base</p>
<p>Hankou, 1st (Central News Agency) - The elite Japanese troops raided Changsha, the base of the Ninth War Area of the Chongqing army, on the 25th. On the nights of the 27th and 29th, they raided the Chongqing army positions in Laohekou and the Hengyang airfield, respectively, destroying 17 Chongqing aircraft. On the night of the 30th, a Japanese bomber squadron bombed the Liangshan airfield in Sichuan Province, fiercely bombing for an hour, destroying ten large aircraft and more than twenty small aircraft, and causing four large aircraft and nine small aircraft to catch fire and burn. At the same time, the bomber squadron also raided Hengyang, destroying two small aircraft parked at the airfield. The forward base aircraft of the U.S. Air Force, gathered from Guilin and other areas, have also been decimated by the fierce Japanese bombing. The Chongqing army's attempt has also been completely shattered. It is now estimated that more than 10% of the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing has been destroyed. Today, bomber squadrons successively flew to the Liangshan airfield, dropping giant bombs on its runway and, with the airfield as the center, moving back and forth, bombing the enemy's airfield on the east side, northeast, northwest, and north. The giant bombs were sure to hit, so the enemy airfield has turned into a sea of fire. At this time, only one enemy fighter plane took off, but it immediately fled in a panic. Only one anti-aircraft gun was still firing, but it seemed to fall silent after the sudden attack by Japanese aircraft. Japanese aircraft destroyed more than 43 enemy aircraft, achieving brilliant war gains, and all returned safely to base.</p>
<h3>This Newspaper Holds a Banquet in Nanjing to Introduce Dr. Sasaki</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 1st (Central News Agency) - The Shanghai Shen Bao and Xinwen Bao, co-sponsored a wartime academic lecture and invited Dr. Sasaki as the lecturer. To introduce Dr. Sasaki to the industrial and academic experts and the press in the capital, the Shen Bao held a banquet, with over ten people attending. First, Liu Hanru, representing the Shen Bao, gave a speech. Then, Dr. Sasaki gave a speech. A symposium began in the afternoon, with Dr. Sasaki and various agricultural experts participating. Dr. Sasaki reported on the current agricultural production increase in Japan and the recent situation of agricultural college education. They exchanged opinions and dispersed at 7 PM. (Another report) Dr. Sasaki is scheduled to visit a farm on the 2nd and go to Jiangsu on the 3rd.</p>
<h3>Japanese Scientists Successfully Research Oil-Based Rubber and Artificial Milk</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) - The East Asia Fuel Research Institute has successfully researched and manufactured aircraft fuel and aviation oil from raw rubber. It is said that the enemy, the United States, which lost its rubber resources in the South, is currently researching synthetic rubber. Japan has abundant rubber resources. In addition to utilizing its inherent characteristics, it will also be converted into oil for the needs of scientific warfare. The oil-based rubber of the East Asia Fuel Research Institute is entirely the result of Japanese research. According to foreign research results, this original spirit of oil technology is a manifestation of Japan's scientific strength.</p>
<h3>U.S. Troops on Biak Island Forced Near the Coast; Enemy Also Ambushed in the Dam Area</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) - The elite Japanese troops on Biak Island have been fiercely intercepting the U.S. troops landing on the island since the morning of the 27th of last month, resulting in fierce battles in recent days. On the Russneck side, the coastline where the main enemy force landed is a sheer cliff about seven to eight miles long. The enemy troops are squirming in the narrow space between the precipice and the terrifying waves. The Japanese army has consistently used the favorable terrain to ambush the enemy troops day and night, finally forcing the enemy troops near the shore. From May 30th to the present, the enemy corpses recovered have exceeded 2,000, while the Japanese army's casualties are only 30. The enemy troops attempted to seize the Japanese airfield in Moikmer, but due to the Japanese army's attack, they have begun to retreat, intending to assemble to the east of Moikmer.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 1st (Central News Agency) - The Southwestern Pacific Anti-Axis Command announced that U.S. troops landed on Biak Island, north of New Guinea. According to Reuters, U.S. troops bombarded the southeast coast of the island before landing and bombed the southeast coast of the island with large bomber formations. However, when the U.S. troops landed, the U.S. landing craft were fiercely bombarded by Japanese coastal artillery, suffering heavy damage. After the U.S. troops landed on the island, they suffered heavy casualties due to the strong resistance of the Japanese defenders.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) - A dispatch from a certain base in the South Pacific states that Japanese troops in the Wewak area of New Guinea ambushed enemy troops in the Dam area on the 27th, leaving 300 enemy corpses behind. In addition, about 800 enemy troops in the area, unable to withstand the fierce attacks of the Japanese army, boarded ten boats in the afternoon and fled to the opposite shore.</p>
<h3>Agricultural Production Increase Association Promotes Work</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 1st (Central News Agency) - Recently, the food problem has been a major concern for all parties. To understand the agricultural production increase situation this year, a reporter visited the person in charge of the Agricultural Production Increase Promotion Committee of the Executive Yuan and received the following information: This year, the food production increase has been actively promoted by the Association with the establishment of various concrete methods. Now, all relevant agencies and local governments are proceeding under the same pace to jointly plan the progress to ensure the increase in production work to achieve the desired effect. The implementation of various methods is very smooth now, especially the lower level production increase groups such as provinces, cities, counties, and districts can understand the government's intention to increase production and make efforts to be responsible for the actual production increase task. The results are very satisfactory. At present, the Association is focusing on the selection of guidance methods such as instruction and rewards, the promotion of suitable seedling fields, the guidance of cultivation techniques such as fertilization and storage, and insect pest control, the improvement of agricultural tools, and the management of demonstration farms and special farms. With regard to incentives, such as the reclamation of wasteland, the utilization of vacant land, rice cultivation, seed selection for seedling fields, appraisal of pest and weed removal, and the distribution of ammonium sulfate, all of these incentive matters are being actively promoted separately. It is firmly believed that the achievements of this year's food production increase will have a leapfrog development. Regarding the food purchasing work, the relevant authorities have expressed that they will make appropriate adjustments to the purchasing methods. The food production increase work this year will naturally be smoother.</p>
<h3>Japanese People in North China Participate in Key Industries</h3>
<p>North China, 1st (Central News Agency) - The office of the Japanese Embassy in Beijing established and implemented the "Temporary Adjustment Rules for Labor Force, etc." on March 1st in order to ensure the adequacy of personnel in important industries and to increase combat power. This time, in accordance with Article 4 of the rules, a special designation was made for 100 Japanese to participate in key industries. The selection of personnel this time was entirely by the consulates of each consulate general from the volunteers. Prior consent was obtained in advance. It is completely different from the previous recruitment.</p>
<h3>Four Quatrains from a Northern Tour</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yipeng</p>
<p>Traveling by plane from Nanjing, a distance of two thousand miles, took only four hours to reach Beijing, which can be called extremely fast.</p>
<p>For a long time, the art of the celestial horse galloping through the air has been passed down. Today, I ascend, my mind is open, and I look down upon the mortal world as too ethereal. Why bother to learn the immortals to ascend?</p>
<p>Touring the Summer Palace for a week, the scenery is no different from twenty years ago. Revisiting the old place makes one endlessly lost in thought.</p>
<p>Visiting this old place twenty years ago, the scenery is still magnificent. The mountain spirits still welcome and send off guests, not asking about rosy faces or white hair.</p>
<p>On the way back, I changed to a car to inspect the courts along the route, refusing to accept supplies. Shandong has a long-standing Chen as a bodyguard, but I feel that I am not free.</p>
<p>Red tape is deleted in one fell swoop. Traveling through Yan and Qi, I do not refuse hardship. A scholar has not learned the ways of an official. The protection of clouds is already embarrassing.</p>
<p>From Jinan to Bengbu, it was almost noon at night. The whole city had no electricity. I groped my way to the High Court to rest, and was frantically bitten by bedbugs all night, unable to sleep.</p>
<p>The city is deep in the evening haze, people are tired, and the car stops on the road. In the deep of night in a traveler's inn, I can't sleep, waiting for dawn with a lamp as small as a bean.</p>
<h3>More Than 10,000 Indian Soldiers Defect to the Japanese Army</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reported from Rangoon: Fifteen thousand Indian soldiers who were forcibly recruited by the British have defected to the Japanese army. These Indian soldiers and university students are all part of the Indian National Army led by Jangtra Bause.</p>
<h3>Gandhi Still Firmly Advocates Expelling the British</h3>
<p>Lishi Ben, 1st (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Mumbai, Gandhi sent a letter to Indian political authority Ziyagar on May 30, which read as follows: The Indian National Congress passed a resolution in August 1942 to expel the British from India. I still have no intention of abandoning this resolution, as this resolution is like my life. Although I have been released, I have no sense of happiness, but rather feel ashamed. Although the Indian people have great expectations for me, the British authorities may imprison me again when my health recovers.</p>
<h3>Fierce Rearguard Battles on the Italian Central Front</h3>
<p>Berlin, 1st (Central News Agency) - Haituong News Agency military reporter Setorius stated: The battle on the Italian front is increasingly developing into a bitter battle for the Albanian Mountains. The mountains are still controlled by the German army, which greatly hinders the anti-Axis advance on Rome. Since Monday, the enemy army has launched a frontal attack on the German mountain defense line from the southeast and northeast. At the same time, it has also advanced rapidly in the area between the Albanian Mountains and the coast, hoping to encircle the area. As a result, it has gained nothing but heavy casualties. The British army has also made no progress in attacking Adia on both sides of the coastal area. Inland, the anti-Axis army attacked the Camponaione and Laluvio lines with a large army, but was blocked at the southern foot of the Albanian Mountains. On Tuesday, the anti-Axis army dispatched a total of 200 tanks, losing 70. The new front line in the central area has only had rearguard activity in recent days. The German army is retreating according to plan, because the enemy army is closely pressing from the east and repeatedly trying to outflank the German army's rearguard action from the south. The rearguard battle is becoming increasingly fierce. In the Lepini Mountains, the enemy army used the mountain valley highway to attack the southern ridge. The German rearguard troops resisted section by section, repeatedly preventing the attack of the Moroqiang army. Although the army finally reached Capizinci, it was only half of the entire journey. Further north, the vanguard of the British Eighth Army was blocked by the Niang army security team in the Flosina area. There were also fierce battles in the area between the source of the Meierfa River and the upper reaches of the Lilie River. The German rearguard fought and retreated, inflicting heavy losses on the New Zealand and Polish armies. As for the German army that was previously fighting in central Apennines, its avoidance action was also achieved. According to news from the India-Burma front, the recent battlefields in the Arakan Mountains have had continuous rain and thunderstorms, wetting the soldiers' uniforms, which makes one feel that the rainy season in India-Burma is about to arrive. The difficulty of fighting in the rain goes without saying. However, the current showers and storms are caused by the Southwest monsoon bringing a large amount of rain. The so-called rainy season is another matter. The unique season of the South, the rainy season, begins in India-Burma from the end of June to the beginning of July. Before explaining this, it is necessary to know the general meteorological conditions of India-Burma.</p>
<h3>India-Burma Operations and the Rainy Season</h3>
<p>The End of the Dry Season</p>
<p>During the winter, the high pressure that occurs in the Asian continent continuously flows southward to areas of low pressure. This northerly wind brings snowfall in the northeast and Hokuriku areas of Japan, wind in the Kanto area, and in India-Burma, it brings clear, cool, and pure air to the plains of the Irrawaddy River basin, centered on Mandalay. This so-called autumn climate of Burma begins in November and December, continuing until January. After that, the temperature gradually increases, and by February and March, there are also hot days exceeding forty degrees in shaded areas, and a long period of dryness continues, causing the plains to turn into a desert-like state, and the air becomes turbid. This cold period in November, December, and January, and the hot summer period in February and March, are both considered the dry season. At the end of March, there are many days of closed fog in northern Assam, and soon thunderclouds begin to occur in the Arakan, Patka, Qin, and other mountainous areas. The thunderclouds turn into thunderstorms, and the rain falls in order from south to north. These thunderstorms, as reported in the recent India-Burma front, occur frequently, but fall from afternoon to dusk, and last for about one or two hours. The initial rainfall is sparse, but it is accompanied by strong winds, with wind speeds of twenty meters not uncommon. By May, the wind force weakens, and conversely, the rainfall increases, with heavy rains of thirty to fifty centimeters per day, causing small bridges built over streams to be washed away.</p>
<p>The Real Rainy Season</p>
<p>When India-Burma enters this state, the weather turns into a summer scene. That is, the pressure, which is the opposite of the winter, causes the high pressure on the Indian Ocean side and the low pressure inside the continent, and all seasonal winds alternate. Right before this alternation, India-Burma is frequently attacked by cyclones rising from the Bay of Bengal, moving northward. These cyclones occur in the South Seas, hurricanes occur in the Gulf of Mexico, and cyclones also occur in the North Sea of Australia. This is also when the north-south wind system changes and is uncertain. This is a precursor to the Southwest monsoon, and from then on, India-Burma enters the real rainy season. The Southwest monsoon blows from the Indian Ocean to the southwest from the end of June through July, August, and September. Therefore, during this period, there is much wind and rain in the Indian Ocean. In addition, the wind rolls up the moisture from this sea surface as it advances, so the highlands of Assam, Arakan, and Tanintharyi are hit by heavy rains. The intensity of the rain cannot be imagined in Japan and other places. Cherrapunji, south of Assam, has the highest rainfall in the world, and a record of 200 centimeters of rainfall in a day is not uncommon. According to past observations, the rainfall in the coastal area in July averages more than 1,000 centimeters per month. The rainy season conditions in the mountainous areas with heavy rainfall, such as the Patkai Range and the Arakan Mountains, which are now battlefields, cannot be imagined. The Southwest monsoon gradually weakens in September. Soon, the north-south wind system alternates again, the dry season begins, and in October, the same cyclones occur as in June, but the frequency is greater than in June.</p>
<p>A Overview of India-Burma Weather</p>
<p>The above is an overview of the weather in India-Burma. As a result of the heavy rains, the ground is muddy, and most of the rivers are flooded. Land mobile warfare is hampered, and it is difficult to predict whether the war situation will be deadlocked.</p>
<p>The Difficulty of Operations</p>
<p>As for aircraft, it is very difficult to fly over high mountains and ridges covered with cumulus clouds. When bombers reach the airspace over the target, it is difficult to accurately bomb due to cloud cover, and the results of the battle are not easy to identify. Therefore, both the enemy and we must do our utmost to fight before the rainy season arrives. This is the characteristic of this front line. However, the rainy season does not completely stop the war. During the period of war subsidence, preparations can be enriched, and the maintenance unit and the transportation unit continue to be active, engaging in a war of attrition. Although large aircraft cannot be dispatched, a small number of aircraft can be dispatched to conduct guerrilla warfare. Related to this guerrilla warfare is the active utilization of this season, taking advantage of the enemy's concerns, and winning by surprise, which is also under consideration.

<h3>Bulgarian and German Troops Rapidly Advancing; Rumor of Soviet Military Action Imminent</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Zurich, dated the 1st: A dispatch from Ankara states that well-informed sources in Turkey claim the Soviet authorities, in light of the rapid advance of German troops in Bulgaria and the pro-German leanings of the Bulgarian forces, may commence military action before June 25th.</p>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Zurich, dated the 1st: The political situation in Bulgaria seems highly unstable. Although there is no reliable information, German sources report that the new Bulgarian National Alliance has joined forces with the authorities to organize armed units to suppress dissidents. Meanwhile, Chief of the General Staff Rugaši has been appointed Director-General of Education, and his successor as Chief of the General Staff, Telyuono, has assumed office. Furthermore, a dispatch from Ankara states that Speaker of Parliament Karfaff, who had previously begun forming a pro-German cabinet, abandoned the idea due to Soviet threats, fearing a severance of relations between Bulgaria and the Soviet Union. The German side, due to frequent domestic unrest in Bulgaria and Turkey's growing closeness to the anti-Axis powers, is hesitant to exert its power there.</p>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Berlin, dated the 1st: German diplomatic authorities maintain a calm attitude regarding the political situation in Bulgaria. Although Soviet pressure on Bulgaria is evident, the Bulgarian people, known for their composure, will not abandon their established policy. German diplomatic authorities, when questioned by the press, only stated that no Bulgarian dignitaries are scheduled to visit Germany, so no such event is planned in the coming weeks.</p>
<h3>Turkish Foreign Minister Returns to Ankara</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Ankara, dated the 1st: Turkish Foreign Minister Menemencioğlu returned to Ankara on Wednesday. He had briefly stayed in Istanbul, where President İsmet İnönü is currently residing.</p>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Ankara, dated the 1st: Mr. Setter, in the "Morning Post," criticized an article published in the British press entitled "What Does Britain Demand of Turkey?". The writer stated that Prime Minister Churchill is demanding that Turkey completely cease exports to Germany, provide the anti-Axis powers with military bases, and promptly declare war. The author of the article stated that he is well aware of Britain's traditional desire to avoid bloodshed, but that Turkey, while hoping for a swift end to the war, cannot achieve it at the cost of Turkish blood. The British press's comments will absolutely not change Turkey's views, and Turkey cannot comply with Churchill's demands.</p>

<h3>Grand Opening of the Health Campaign Conference Yesterday, Unprecedented Public Participation</h3>
<p>The Municipal Health Campaign Conference and Health Exhibition, actively prepared by the Municipal Health Bureau, held its opening ceremony at the Paramount Theatre on Jing'an Temple Road at 9 a.m. yesterday. The event was unprecedented. The proceedings of yesterday's conference are detailed below: At 10 a.m., youth groups, Pao Chia leaders, and officials were present on time. After the opening, Mayor Chen, as chairman, led the attendees in performing the required rituals. He then reported on the preparations and explained the various activities planned for the next seven days, urging the Pao Chia leaders to diligently supervise the implementation to maintain public health. Subsequently, Director Liang and others delivered speeches, elucidating the close relationship between hygiene and the nation and society, hoping that citizens would pay close attention. After the speeches, the officials led a large cleaning campaign along Jing'an Temple Road. After taking photographs at the racecourse, they visited the health exhibition. The scale was truly unprecedented. At 8:25 p.m., in order to encourage public awareness of public health, Mayor Chen gave a broadcast speech at the Grand Shanghai Radio Station. The text of the Mayor's speech is recorded below.</p>
<p>Mayor Chen's Radio Address</p>
<p>Today marks the commencement of the activities of the Municipal Health Campaign Conference. Regarding the significance of the health campaign, many experts have contributed articles during the opening ceremony, clearly explaining the importance of the health campaign, which everyone should generally understand. I don't need to repeat it. However, I feel there is one point that everyone should pay attention to, which is cleanliness and hygiene. Everyone knows its importance, but they don't put it into practice. This is due to a lack of cultivation. We must not only know but also practice it with perseverance. Once it becomes a habit, it will naturally be put into practice. To give an example: we tend to become clean in clean places and dirty in dirty places. Take spitting, for instance. Some people do not spit indiscriminately when they are abroad, but when they return to China, they spit everywhere. This is due to a lack of cultivation. Hygiene should start at home, so I hope parents will instill clean habits in their infants from a young age, so that they can grow up with strong bodies. Sputum contains many bacteria that can be transmitted by dust or flies, causing citizens to suffer from tuberculosis. Many people understand this principle, but there are still many who seem to think that as long as they don't spit indoors or on the floor, it's okay to spit outside the door. In fact, spitting outside the door is just as infectious, so we must not only pay attention to personal hygiene but also public hygiene, which requires cultivation and habit. Parents should be aware of this. Having a healthy physique is better than money, especially during this Greater East Asia War. The nation needs to increase production, but if the people's physique is not healthy, there is no way to increase production. Furthermore, citizens have the obligation to serve as soldiers, which is impossible without a strong body. According to statistics from physical examinations of young men in our country, only 6% pass. This is a significant loss for the nation. Some criticize the Chinese army as being unable to win or lose decisively. How do you explain this? Because after winning, they have to run forward, but due to their weak physique, they often lose their food bags. If they lose, it's even worse; they simply throw away their guns. This is not due to a lack of combat knowledge or combat strength, but rather a lack of physical strength. Therefore, unhealthy people cannot enjoy rights or fulfill obligations, so everyone must know the importance of hygiene and practice good hygiene habits, and not violate hygiene ethics. Especially parents, should pay close attention to infant health and cultivate hygiene habits. This is my sincere hope that all citizens will put into practice.</p>
<p>Radio Broadcast Schedule</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Health Bureau, for the Health Campaign Conference, will conduct alternating health movement radio broadcasts starting last night (the 1st). At 8:25 p.m. yesterday, Director Yuan of the Health Bureau gave a speech on behalf of Mayor Chen entitled "The Health Construction of Greater Shanghai." Tonight, Director Yuan will broadcast "The Significance of the Health Campaign." Other radio broadcast programs have already been scheduled and are listed below: On the 3rd, Director Liang of the Propaganda Department will speak on "The Importance of Summer Hygiene." On the 4th, Dr. Yen Fu-ching of the Chinese Red Cross Society will speak on "The Value of Disease Prevention and Treatment." On the 5th, Gu Nanqun of the Physicians' Association, on the 6th, Yang Shih-ta of the French Medical Association, and on the 7th, Fang Kan will broadcast on the prevalence of pulmonary tuberculosis in Shanghai and its prevention measures. The time is from 8:25 p.m. to 8:35 p.m. nightly. Citizens are urged to listen.</p>
<h3>First District Public Works Office Pays Attention to Public Cleanliness, Cracks Down on Illegal Construction</h3>
<p>The First District of the city is responsible for all cleaning work, such as sweeping roads, dredging sewers, removing garbage, and waste, etc., and the Public Works Office is responsible for presiding over it, and it is listed as the most important work of the office. The number of employees who specialize in this work is more than several thousand people, all of whom have rich experience and can endure hardship and stand hard work. Sincerely, this cleaning work is related to public health, so no matter the weather or the industry, it has never been interrupted for a day. Recently, cleaning work in the newly merged areas of Hongkou and Zhabei is being actively rectified, and the cleaning work in the former Eighth District is also being taken over. Administrative unification will increase efficiency and benefit the citizens.</p>
<p>The Public Works Office has regulations on public and private buildings in the district, and the restrictions are quite strict. Since the incident, the administrative organization has undergone several changes, and during the transition between the old and the new, management has been lax, which has led to the rise of illegal construction. This has had a great impact on citizen safety, hygiene, and the appearance of the city. This phenomenon is most evident in the Hongkou District, and even the canals are blocked, causing the greatest cause of flooding in Hongkou. The Public Works Office is strictly cracking down on this illegal construction and has set up a flood mitigation plan.</p>
<p>Suggestion Box Established</p>
<p>Since taking office, Director Wu Songgao has paid attention to the reorganization of municipal administration, especially the cleanliness of the city and the safety of buildings. He is concerned about the people's livelihood and is pragmatic. I hope that citizens will cooperate with him at any time. In order to eliminate the gap between the citizens and the Public Works Bureau, he has ordered the Public Works Bureau to set up a suggestion box (No. 193 Hankou Road). The person in charge will open it every day. If citizens have any comments on the Public Works Bureau, they can submit them in writing to the suggestion box at any time. The Bureau always takes the welfare of the citizens as its premise and is always happy to adopt them.</p>

<h3>Youth Association Health Movement Scheduled to Open Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Youth Association holds a health movement every summer to deepen public awareness of hygiene, nutrition, health, and disease prevention, and to pay attention to them.

<h3>French Tram Company Increases Fares</h3>

Therefore, the company increased prices yesterday (the 1st). The fare for first-class trams ranges from three yuan to eight yuan, with a total of six types, and the fare for third-class trams ranges from two yuan to five yuan, with a total of four types.

<p>Short Comment</p>
<h3>Quickly Raising Emergency Relief Funds</h3>
<p>In recent days, the Municipal price black market has skyrocketed. After the "Shanghai Citizens' Food Rice Management Provisional Measures" was announced a few days ago, the general public became even more suspicious and speculated, and the rice price black market became even more chaotic. There are still three months before the new rice harvest. We urgently hope that all relevant parties will quickly raise emergency relief funds to calm people's hearts. We make the following suggestions:</p>
<p>Announce the application procedures for transportation permits as soon as possible, and strive to simplify them. At present, general transportation is quite difficult. If the permit application procedures are complicated and slow, it will be even more difficult to provide emergency relief.</p>
<p>Strive to designate rice storage warehouses universally, and strive to simplify the procedures for entering and leaving the warehouse. Or, the quantity purchased can be deducted during the warehouse verification and stored separately, without mixing them together, which is more convenient.</p>
<p>Announce the purchase price and the legal market price as soon as possible, so that merchants and people know what to follow, and are enthusiastic about mining and transportation, so as to ensure the smooth flow of sources.</p>
<p>Strictly select and employ the inspectors and passport office staff at each rice entry port, and ensure absolute fairness and integrity.</p>
<p>The minimum quantity that does not require a passport and is not subject to purchase should be at least one dan, so as to facilitate free transportation.</p>
<p>Finally, we hope that the authorities will pay close attention to the chaos of the rice price black market, which is enough to affect general prices and make the public suffer greatly. In this demand to stabilize people's livelihood, it is necessary to effectively curb rice prices and stabilize general prices.</p>

<h3>South Pacific Front Line: A Record of Enemy Annihilation by Supply Troops</h3>
<p>Two motorized boats, with Lieutenant Ōuchi as captain, and one armed small motorized boat were heading straight for Cape Moresby. The sky was clear, there was no moon, and the stars were twinkling. The waves in the Java Sea were calm. They were steadily sailing toward the base, covering a total of sixty-five miles from 〇〇 to 〇〇, fulfilling their transportation mission in secret. At that time, suddenly there were two long whistle sounds. It was a cautious whistle sound, indicating the appearance of enemy submarines. Armed boat captain Ōtsuka discovered the enemy silhouette at a 40-degree angle to the right, approximately 600 meters ahead. One, two, three... five enemy torpedo boats were churning through the waves in the darkness. The Ōtsuka boat, signaling "Prepare for battle," made a sharp turn to the right. Gunner Corporal Hirai quietly aimed at the second enemy boat. Step by step, closer and closer, the command "Fire" was given, and simultaneously, rapid-fire shells, trailing red tails, flew towards the second enemy boat. The first shot hit the hull, and flames lit up the surrounding sea.</p>
<p>Desperate Preemptive Strike</p>
<p>The fourth enemy boat rushed in with rapid speed to avenge its comrades. Machine gunner Fuchigami was hit by enemy fire and fell. Sergeant Takahashi seized the gun handle, firing bullets even more densely than before. The fourth enemy boat was wounded and tried to turn away to escape. Private Nomura shot one bullet, and it sank 150 meters ahead.</p>
<p>The morale of the Ōtsuka boat, which had already sunk two enemy torpedo boats, was further boosted. Lieutenant Ōuchi's boat escorted the armed boat to battle, while he himself continued towards the base. At this time, on the starboard side of the Ōtsuka boat was what appeared to be an enemy command boat, and on the port side, the enemy's third boat, charging in amidst heavy gunfire. Unfortunately, two bullets hit the stern on the starboard side, and one bullet hit the bow on the port side, creating a large hole. Seawater gurgled in. But what did the flooding matter? Even though the water was up to their chests, they still pressed forward towards the fifth enemy boat.</p>
<p>It was at this critical moment, with the two sides only fifteen meters apart, that Captain Ōtsuka fired his pistol. The entire crew charged together, leaping onto the enemy torpedo boat. The fifth boat took the opportunity to escape, and the third boat also launched a smokescreen and fled towards the coast.</p>
<p>However, the Ōtsuka boat had already sustained three shell hits and several heavy machine-gun hits, and the flooding was increasing every moment. In the past, in such situations, Captain Ōtsuka would order anchoring and landing. Although the artillery was stained with the blood of the soldiers, it was all undamaged. Vowing to avenge themselves in tomorrow's battle, Captain Ōtsuka was determined to move all the artillery ashore. Just then, the sound of enemy planes bombing grew closer overhead. Following this, two flares were dropped, illuminating the surroundings as bright as day. In the clear sky, the Ōtsuka boat floated on the water. Armed and unafraid, the three bombs that were dropped caused no major damage, and the entire crew couldn't help but shout "Banzai!" Soon, the artillery was safely landed.</p>
<p>But the battle was not over. In less than a week, the enemy sent out more than fifteen torpedo boats and more than five aircraft, launching a nighttime attack to cut off our supply route. That day's battle occurred at Kasserine Bay at five o'clock.</p>
<p>The Kondo unit, with Lieutenant Kitazawa as captain, consisting of four motorboats and one armed small motorboat, was responsible for the 〇〇 transport mission, waiting in the darkness to set out for 〇〇.</p>
<p>Shortly after departure, the Horita boat's machinery malfunctioned. It immediately attached a tow rope to the Nishizaki boat, towing it while making repairs. But at this time, two enemy torpedo boats came to attack. Captain Kitazawa immediately ordered to open fire. After about ten minutes of battle, the enemy was repelled. The second attack was at 7:20. Two enemy torpedo boats challenged the armed small motorboat towing the Horita boat. Our armed boat cut the tow rope and prepared to fight. A preemptive attack was the key to victory. Our armed boat opened fire first, engaging the enemy torpedo boats in close combat. The enemy fled in fear. Finally, they fired a row of machine guns as if farting, and one bullet hit the hull of our armed boat.</p>
<p>Captain Kitazawa had no choice but to leave the armed boat and the Horita boat behind, and rushed to 〇〇 with three motorboats. However, that place was on fire, and with the strong wind and waves, landing was impossible.</p>
<p>Tragic Bayonet Fight</p>
<p>Turning the bow of the ship, weren't two enemy torpedo boats firing at us? What made it even worse for us was that the closer we got to the 〇〇 River bank, the more we became the target of enemy bombers, which kept circling overhead. Captain Kitazawa endured patiently, seizing the opportunity to reduce the enemy's numbers. The flares illuminated everything as white as day. After careful observation, there were several torpedo boats guarding our route. The enemy bombers began strafing with machine guns, and the armed boat also fired the first shot in an anti-aircraft battle. At the same time, they launched a three-boat assault on the rightmost torpedo boat in front. In a bayonet fight at sea, with the center of gravity towards the first enemy boat, they concentrated their firepower on that ship and sank it (Translated by Sho from the May 17th Western Asahi Shimbun)</p>
<h3>Map Explanation</h3>
<p>In the major battlefields of Asia and Europe, where the Axis and Anti-Axis forces are engaged, storm clouds are gathering, portending a major conflict. The Imphal encirclement on the India-Burma front has frustrated the Anglo-American ambition to recapture Burma and launch an offensive against Japan. Britain has been forced to switch from offense to defense. In the Central and South Pacific, although the US offensive has encountered the solid defenses of the Japanese forces in the Inner South Seas, it still hopes to achieve its invasion ambitions through aerial bombardment. And in Europe, the Anglo-Americans are about to launch a second front against the German forces' heavily fortified European fortress. The movements of these major battlefields in Asia and Europe are noteworthy (See map below).</p>

<h3>Three Years</h3>
<p>— Meng Hong</p>
<p>Time rolls on like a giant wheel, but it's not a cycle. It only moves forward, passing through hot summers, passing through harsh winters, and bringing the warmth of early spring again. People all stumble into the warmth of early spring, smiling, laughing…</p>
<p>With a bitter heart, enduring the hardships of life, painfully dragging through these long years, it has been a full three years. The traumas of life have numbed my senses, devouring the remnants of my remaining youth. I no longer have the courage to fight against life. A former rebel against fate is now passively accepting fate's dominion. Everything in front of me seems so ordinary, mundane, trivial, and boring...</p>
<p>The traces of tin foil left in front of new graves in my hometown, the people wearing plain clothes and carrying offerings at the entrance of the funeral parlor, remind me that it is already the season for Qingming tomb sweeping. Plain clothes, white ribbons, paper ingots... all this prompts me to unveil the curtain of memory.</p>
<p>Three years ago, the flames of war spread to N County near the sea. At that time, I was studying at N County Middle School. Lin was originally a sophomore at the Provincial Middle School in S City, but she also transferred to N County Middle School for the semester. Because we shared common interests, we had many opportunities to interact. When war clouds gathered over N County, I was bedridden with typhoid fever. The county middle school was preparing to relocate. Students who had homes went home, and those who were following the school went with them. Only a few students were left behind who had no home to return to and nowhere to go. So Lin, who was taking care of me, and I moved to live in Mu Village, a rural village more than twenty miles from the city.</p>
<p>Under extremely difficult living conditions, we had only two meals of rice porridge every day. In total, we had only two hundred yuan and a few jiao left in our pockets.</p>
<p>Life melted us with hardship, tension, anger, thoughts... connecting us into a whole. I did not suffer the slightest distress from the war or my illness. The noble friendship and great hope were enough to comfort me. Every time I saw Lin working tirelessly, I felt uneasy and grateful. She was working hard enough for any classmate.</p>
<p>She was a southern girl, small and sturdy in stature, with light brown skin, hair cut short to the ears, and two large, lively eyes that revealed her intelligence. Her slightly dark face had two dimples just the right size. She wasn't very beautiful, but she gave people another kind of friendly, harmonious, and natural aura. Especially her excellent voice, which made students gather around her. Her name resounded throughout the school because of her voice, and even other schools had heard of her name. When she was surrounded, the only way to get out was to sing a song.</p>
<p>Occasionally, when she was free, she would sit by my bedside and talk about future hopes to comfort me, who was suffering from severe homesickness, or sing her nightingale-like songs to change my melancholy mood. I loved these things and was grateful to her for giving them to me.</p>
<p>The incurable typhoid fever made my illness worse. Lin advised me to leave N County immediately and come to Shanghai. N County had become very unstable because of the war. At the same time, Lin was too tired. So I decided to come to Shanghai. However, Lin remained in N County, because the cost of travel for two people would be even greater. After I recovered from my illness, I would still have to return to N County to realize our common hopes.</p>
<p>In the late January, on a warm morning, I prepared to set off. The night before, Lin had packed my luggage and told me many things. I knew she hadn't slept all night, but she didn't dare to wake me, fearing I would be tired. Every time I woke up, I heard her coughing and sighing, and I felt a little uncomfortable in my heart. When she woke up early in the morning, Lin had arranged everything very well. At this moment, she was sitting by the bed in a daze. I thought she must be feeling very sad too.</p>
<p>The sun was very good, and the universe seemed so full of vitality. I hailed a boat to take us to E Town to catch the small ferry to N County City, and then take a car to Shanghai. The market in E Town was very desolate due to the impact of the war. We ate something in a noodle shop and sat there waiting for the small ferry, because there were too many things to say, we couldn't say a single word. Everyone sat silently, each with complex emotions hidden in their hearts, until she sent me on board when the boat was about to leave: "Take care on the way, don't forget to write often, bring me some chocolate when you come back." She said this with a smile on her face, her voice already a little choked. Although I knew she really liked chocolate, at this moment, the meaning of her words was not about those things, but to make me forget the pain of separation. I nodded, tears already streaming down my face. For the entire month of winter, I thanked her for her long-term care. The five months we spent together made us like family.</p>
<p>The boatman untied the rope and reached out to shake Lin's hand, reluctant to let go but finally released it. We parted: "Don't worry! I will never forget you." Just a few words, but how difficult it was for me to say them. This voice was almost inaudible even to myself. However, Lin understood me. The small boat moved towards the center of the river. I stood on the deck and saluted her. Ah, she smiled! This was as it should be. For the past few days, she had been in a solemn face and hadn't smiled. She was waving the blue silk handkerchief in her hand in the air, until I could still see that shadow when the small boat turned - that shadow that could never be erased. I fell into the cabin and cried, crying heartily. The people on the boat looked at me with sympathy, confused. I became the center of attention.</p>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai, I sent six consecutive letters to Lin, but there was no reply. After two months of recuperation, I recovered my health and immediately bought a large box of chocolate and other things she needed to go to the countryside. On the car, I imagined the scene when we met again. It would be fun to startle her. We were about to realize our common hopes.</p>
<p>Lin was not in Lu Village. The villagers only told me a little bit, but that little bit already made me very sad. After the war, the countryside was full of bandits. Lin was killed by thugs with a sharp blade because she refused the bandits' demands, ending her short youthful life.</p>
<p>I can't say what day Lin died, I only know that she died three years ago at this time. I don't even know where her body is buried. I just dug a hole in the garden next to the house we lived in in Lu Village, and put in that box of chocolate and the things Lin needed, and wrote a piece of wood with my own hand - the place of memory: Zhao Lin's memorial site - and stuck it under the soil next to the hole. Now it has been a full three years. Who knows if this wooden board is still next to the original hole?</p>
<p>Over the past three years, the life of wandering outside has gradually diluted the past, but every time I hear other people's songs and cries, or other white ribbons, paper ingots, and things that make me feel emotional, I often think of the past again, once, twice, three times... already</p>
<p>Memories are sweet, but the pain after recalling is unbearable!</p>

<p>Movie Review</p>
<h3>After Watching "Heaven Can Wait"</h3>
<p>— Gu Xin</p>
<p>...A female student, through a chance encounter, meets a "handsome" "writer" and plants the seeds of love. But the female student's father is a typical old stubborn, intentionally and unintentionally creating various obstacles to their interactions, "good things are many times disrupted." But in the end, they finally manage to reunite, and both escape from the clutches of evil. As an extra reward, they also brought another pair of lovers together. -- It's still this kind of story. The romantic atmosphere of the whole film surpasses realism. Apart from giving a little satire to the remnants of feudalism, it's nothing more than letting the audience vent a few extremely short, extremely fleeting laughs.</p>
<p>...The director's inspiration seems insufficient. There are few clever treatments of the scenes, and many shortcomings. The greatest failure is the editing. The plot lacks reasonable continuity, that is the first point. The editing fails to control time well, that is the second point. The shots showing the turning wheels of the train moving forward always seem too long and too tiring each time they appear. Creating a dark scene in the middle of the people, on the one hand, indicates a section of the plot, and on the other hand, allows the audience to shift their gaze for a moment, diluting the boring impression, and then waiting to focus on accepting the new picture, is possible, and needs a little longer time. However, the director of this film seems to think this is a waste, and before the previous scene has just faded away, he hurriedly jumps the next scene into the audience's eyes. He doesn't know that this can actually promote the audience's fatigue. As for the incoherence of the details, that is because there are a few unnecessary transitions between the sections.</p>
<p>...In theory, the psychology of the female student Chen Mingzhu should be quite complex and contradictory. She has worries, but still retains her great innocence. Hu Feng did not portray her well, and the director did not give her enough shots to express herself. Yu Fang, played by Yan Jun, is a completely milk-fed writer. The way Huo Dongmiao and Chen Mingzhu meet, that kind of flirting and approaching movement, is not only full of milk-fed energy, but also mixed with frivolity.</p>
<p>...What is commendable, however, are the two fake senior scholars and in-laws played by Mei Ming and Yin Xiucen. The "gentlemanly" diplomatic dialogues full of shyness when the two meet are full of humor and mockery.</p>

<h3>Celebration of Navy Day: A Comprehensive Report on the Grand Sports Meet, Jing Duan</h3>
<p>The Shanghai New Opened Joint Association, in celebration of the Japanese Navy Memorial Day, specially held a grand sports meet, including track and field events and various ball game performances, which were held on the 25th of last month at three different locations. The audience at each venue exceeded expectations, creating an unprecedented spectacle. A brief account of each event is provided below.</p>
<p>First Sports Ground Track and Field Performance</p>
<p>The track and field performance at the First Sports Ground, held at the racecourse, began at 2:00 PM. The audience reached over 50,000 people. The ceremony was grand. First, the chairman of the association, Xu Li, delivered the opening speech. Then, the naval attaché, Rear Admiral Kondo, gave a speech. Finally, Li Sihao presented the awards. The event concluded as dusk fell.</p>
<p>Exciting Track Events</p>
<p>Among the track events, the 400-meter race was the most captivating. Twelve runners started, and for the first 100 meters, it was impossible to tell who was in the lead. After 100 meters, Qiu Zhenfu took the lead, followed closely by Tan Zhineng and Wu Huanian, who reached the finish line. The 10,000-meter long-distance race broke the national record, truly a gratifying achievement. The record-breaker was the deaf-mute Lou Wen'ao, with a time of 33 minutes and 56 seconds (the national record holder was Sun Che, with a time of 34 minutes and 01 second). Lou Wen'ao's strides were light, and his posture was excellent. With continued effort, the deaf-mute's potential is limitless.</p>
<p>Field Event Results Were Just Average</p>
<p>The results of various field events were just average. Li Zhenzhong's high jump and Wang Xuewu's javelin throw lacked competition, which somewhat diminished the excitement. Otherwise, better results might have been achieved.</p>
<p>Second Sports Ground: Joint Friendship Excels Over Three Provinces</p>
<p>The second sports meet, held at Yiyuan, began at 5:00 PM with a football match between the Three Provinces team and the Joint Friendship team. The game started on time. In the first half, the Joint Friendship team seemed to underestimate their opponents, with Jiang Yimen as the defender and Chen Xiaoping as the center back. This proved to be a disadvantage for the Joint Friendship team. However, Chen Xiaoping's individual performance was excellent, his footwork crisp, and his strength abundant – truly a general's material. The Three Provinces team took advantage of the situation, winning the first half 3-2, causing anxiety among the Joint Friendship players. In the second half, the Joint Friendship team had to adjust their lineup and attack vigorously, scoring three goals and defeating the Three Provinces team 5-3. However, the Three Provinces team's performance was reminiscent of the saying "a newborn calf is not afraid of a tiger." Their penetrations during the first half, threatening the Joint Friendship goal, showed significant progress. After this friendly match, the Three Provinces team was undoubtedly much improved compared to the beginning of the season. The future is bright, and continued effort is encouraged.</p>
<p>Third Sports Ground: China Film Was The Most Outstanding</p>
<p>The third sports ground, located at the Xiqing Gymnasium, featured table tennis, women's volleyball, and men's basketball performances, starting at 5:00 PM. First was table tennis, with the Joint Friendship team playing against Pingya. Both teams had first-class players in the table tennis world. The result was a decisive victory for the Joint Friendship team, 4-1, with exceptional serving skills on display. Next was women's volleyball, with Huada facing the Three Provinces team. Huada had superior talent, but the Three Provinces team won easily 2-0 due to better coordination. Finally, in basketball, the All-Star team defeated the White team 41-40 in the first match. In the last game, Zhongbei faced China Film. Huada's performance in this game was extremely elegant, with Shu Shi, Gao Mang, and Sheng Jun all showing unexpected brilliance. Zhongbei, the Shanghai champion, was nearly defeated. In the end, Zhongbei narrowly won 37-35.</p>
<h3>Impressions After the Preliminary Match of the Tianjin United Football Team</h3>
<p>The Tianjin United Football Team, on this long-distance southern expedition, was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 17th of last month. However, due to the issue of Western expatriates leaving the country, it was delayed. After coordination from various parties, including Mr. Pan Sanxing at sea, the team finally left Tianjin on the 23rd of last month and arrived in Shanghai on the evening of the 24th. The group of eighteen stayed at the Wai Nan Hui Central Hotel. They were scheduled to play four matches in Shanghai. The first match was against the Shanghai United team on the 31st. The Tianjin United team performed reasonably well, drawing the game. Here are some pre-match and post-match impressions.</p>
<p>Pre-Match Estimates</p>
<p>Before the match, most fans had a low opinion of the Tianjin United team, with some saying that their four matches in Shanghai would be a complete failure. This was based on the fact that they were at a disadvantage due to the unfamiliar environment and were also a hastily assembled team. After the team arrived in Shanghai and practiced at the racecourse and played a friendly match with the British Country team, reporters observed that the team was still focused on basic movements. During their practice, they still practiced running, braking, and speed. These are the basic conditions for football, and ideally, all players should always engage in this type of practice to fully develop their abilities (very few teams in Shanghai do this type of practice). After watching the team's practice, I concluded that they had sufficient stamina, were striving for improvement, and that the players, except for a few veterans, were all rising stars. Therefore, there would be unexpected gains. I also interviewed Mr. Xu Wenkui of the Joint Friendship team to get his assessment of the team. Mr. Xu said that the lineup of the Shanghai United team must be carefully considered, otherwise victory could not be guaranteed. In short, the pre-match estimate of the Tianjin United team was that their strength was average, their goalkeeper was particularly good, and that the team could fight to the end. The outcome would depend on the defense, and perhaps on some luck in the attack.</p>
<p>First Match Impressions</p>
<p>The day before yesterday (the 31st), Tianjin United played their first match against Shanghai United, resulting in a 1-1 draw. Tianjin United team displayed some luck, and Shanghai United's performance was somewhat abnormal, so I will not go into detail. I will just briefly describe the impressions that the Tianjin United team gave me in this match. One match is not enough to draw definite conclusions.</p>
<p>Solid Defense with Limited Variation</p>
<p>Their goalkeeping skills were undoubtedly excellent. Their five defenders employed a zone defense with limited variation, with the center backs moving forward and backward. This seemed somewhat mechanical. However, the five defenders were very strong and tried their best to contain the opposing forwards, which was commendable. If the opposing five forwards pushed forward with coordinated passes, they would likely show signs of being overwhelmed. Their two midfielders, although they covered both offense and defense and supported the forwards, were not entirely satisfactory. They seemed completely unaware of how to retreat and assist in defense. Therefore, the team's defense was a type of formal zone defense (similar to the "zone" defense in basketball).</p>
<p>Unskilled W-Formation Attack</p>
<p>The team's attacking method was entirely based on penetrating passes. Once the center forward got the ball, the left and right wings would sprint forward, and the two inside forwards would retreat to assist in defense and use the W-formation. However, the two inside forwards retreated too far during the attack. Therefore, it was impossible to establish the best connection between the center forward and the two wings for coordinated attacks. On the surface, the wingers looked sharp, but due to a lack of coordination, they did not create any strong attacking moves.</p>
<p>Future Predictions</p>
<p>Today afternoon, the team will play against Donghua. It is said that Donghua's morale is high and their momentum is strong. However, the Tianjin United team already achieved a good result in their first match, so their morale and momentum may not be weaker than Donghua's. Therefore, to study who will win or lose, we should look at their tactical approach. Donghua's teamwork is better than Tianjin United's, and their defense is more varied. However, their stamina does not seem as great. More importantly, their goalkeeper is excellent. Therefore, I say that Donghua should win, but the only thing they need to consider is how to break through Du Carter's goal. I feel that relying solely on Han Longhai's fierce attack will be difficult to achieve. Because the Tianjin United defenders are very fast, You Liang should first rush forward to block and cover, and then Longhai can sprint to break through, which would be more effective.</p>
<p>I dare not speculate on the outcome of the match between Tianjin United and the Joint Friendship team, because both teams are better at defense than offense, and their styles are very similar. Recently, the Joint Friendship team performed well during their expedition to North China. Their goalkeeper, A Kui, has twice broken through the opposing defense. Therefore, if Strange Foot does not lose his touch in this match, he will surely show his strange leg and impress us all. Moreover, Lazy Cow Li Yichen's recent form has been improving. He scored twice representing China at the International Cup, causing Mctiernan to look pale with alarm. Considering all this, the Joint Friendship forwards are gradually improving, so if Joint Friendship plays as usual, they can also achieve victory.</p>
<p>Regarding Tianjin United's match against the Shanghai West United team, I say that Tianjin United will be at a disadvantage in many ways. By that time, Tianjin United will have already played three consecutive matches, and they will inevitably show signs of fatigue. Shanghai West United will be well-rested, and after observing several matches, they will gradually become familiar with their playing style. Manager Ma Shan'er is also good at using his intelligence. Therefore, they can use their strengths to attack their weaknesses. Thus, Shanghai West United is also very likely to win.</p>
<p>In summary, Tianjin United has a chance of losing all three matches. Their only hope of reversing the trend is their excellent goalkeeper and their solid center backs, which might allow them to create an unexpected victory.</p>
<h3>Simple Fitness Training Method (10)(8)</h3>
<p>— Translated from German by Tom</p>
<p>No exercise is more suitable than the three: bending, twisting, and turning.</p>
<p>The teaching and practice of these three exercises have been around for years, but due to the lack of a specific purpose, they have not produced the desired results. These three are of paramount importance for maintaining health, so they should be practiced before and after all other exercises. They are far more important than all other exercises. This practice pays attention to the part that is almost completely ignored by physical education teachers, namely the health of the vital center.</p>
<p>If the use of muscles consumes more than it supplies, then no matter how strong they are, health will inevitably be damaged.</p>
<p>Before starting this practice, a brief description of its benefits should be given to encourage students.</p>
<p>Its special benefits are as follows:</p>
<p>First, it creates a connection between the heart, stomach, and liver.</p>
<p>Second, even as one ages, one maintains a graceful posture and does not lose the spirit of youth.</p>
<p>Third, even at the age of sixty or seventy, one does not lose one's vigor.</p>
<p>Fourth, it prevents the hunchback and stiffness common in old age.</p>
<p>Fifth, it prevents and treats obesity; it burns fat tissue and replaces it with strong and firm muscles.</p>
<p>Sixth, it increases the years of life, and it increases the life of years; that is, the so-called "the older the stronger."</p>
