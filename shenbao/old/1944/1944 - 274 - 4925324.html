<h3>一封公開信</h3>
<p>宇垣先生：　　聽說閣下近從華北轉道來滬，考察敝國民間實況，以爲進一步促進中日關係的參攷，不辭辛苦，長途跋涉，曷騰欽仰。又讀到視察各地的感想，更佩抱負的遠大。我站在民間報人的立塲，作此公開信件，說出我所想說的話，同時，也可說是一部分敝國人所想說的話，尚祈不吝指教，幸甚。　　近兩年餘來，大東亞戰爭發生以後，日本對華新政策實施以後，貴國朝野人士蒞臨敝國訪問者頗多。這是極可欣喜的現象。可是，不無遺憾的，貴國來華的朋友，能夠深入中國民間考察實況，能有幾人？能夠聽取民間意見的，又有幾人？假如只在上海看看，或是幾個大都市裹盤桓幾天，酬酢上番，那是得不到什麼實況的。進一步說，如果促進中日關係，寄托於這一類所看到的實況上面，那末，所得的結果與所懸的目標之間，還有很差很遠的距離的。這些都是事實，我們一加覆按思考，就不難證明的。我在去年冬天觀光貴國時，當時覺得貴國朝野瞭解敝國情形者太少了，所以，我更加深切的感到惶恐。　　另一方面，兩年餘　，敝　人士到　國觀光的實在太少。交通不便，當然是一個原因。但是另一個原因，許多人還有成見，不願去。不肯去。因此，貴國所倡導的大東亞主義，所高唱的對華新政策，究竟還距離一條海面，在貴國國內的認識，固然已經形成熱烈，普遍，深刻，眞切的現象，而在敝國民間能夠深切瞭解者還是很少。所以，我得鄭重與誠摯地指出：在這樣塲合之下，如果貴國要使中國民間瞭解，要同貴國國內一樣的熱烈，普遍，深刻，眞切的認識，那末，非在中國地面上以事實表現不可。　　我認爲如何促進中日協力爭取大東亞戰爭勝利，是目前一個最重要的課題，同時，更是我們一種最大的責任。在過去兩年餘間，貴國朝野爲爭取大東亞戰爭勝利，爲解放大東亞民族的桎梏，盡了很多熱血的貢獻。同時，貴國一億人民隨時在埋頭奮鬬中，我們很佩服。可是，敝國方面，自從參戰以後，究竟盡了什麼力量，說出來很惶恐與慚愧。然而，英美敵人的野心未戢，大東亞戰爭是長期戰爭，前途的艱苦正多，是可想而知的。如果敝國在戰爭中未能盡相當力量，則　　　責任不更艱鉅，更重大了。　　當前的問題，中國對大東亞戰爭，過去會盡了什麼力量，固成疑問；而以中國目前的現狀而言，則今後能盡多少力，更是疑問。爲什麼這樣說呢？我認爲有生產才能戰爭，這是不移的原則。而人民必須得到最低限度的生活安定，才能從事生產，才能從事戰爭。但是，從生產方面的現實講，雖則提出了增加生產的口號和計劃，而事實上隨時產生減產的因素，譬如工業方面減產原因，如原料缺乏，電力遞減，物資收買辦法不良，物資搬運不自由，成品限價不合理等等。其次，經濟上地域分割性的存在，在一國之內，幣制不同，統制各異，彼此杅格，使物資交換不能圓滑，國民經濟不能均衡統一的發展，在在爲促成減產的因素。所有一切減產的因素，都是人事上未能盡職，所謂[人謀不臧]。譬如華中華北的物資不能圓滑交流，煤斤，原料，運輸等等，中國人均無法處理，中國人縱願生產，縱願協力，也是無從做起的。　　至於人民最低限度的生活安定問題，因爲物價高漲漫無上境，生活困難，痛苦不已，遑談安定。目前物價較之七年以前，高至三百倍以至一二千倍以上，生活必需品均在七百倍以上，中國人民一般的生活程度，向來是低儉的，要求也並不奢大。而目前生活困難，大都是人爲的原因，不必要的痛苦。可是，人民生活日益痛苦的結果，實予共產主義蔓延的機會，這尤其是東亞的心腹大患，不可不嚴切注意。　　總之，過去一切問題的形成，由於政治不上軌道，認識不足，信念不夠。中國朝野當然應負重大責任。可是，日本當局也有一部分責任，僅僅物資交流不能圓滑的一點，已足使生產減少物價步漲了。所以，我認爲有幾點原則應該提出的：　　第一，在中國的一切事業，能交中國人自己辦理者由中國人自辦，貴國應居於協助指導的地位。　　第二，一件事業，各部門的職權必須統一，職權如不一致，則統制經濟必致紊亂無效。　　第三，貴國人參加中國事業者，應以第一流人才爲主。　　近與貴國友人自廣州來此者晤談，知廣州電燈廠在貴國人管理時，常有斷電缺電之事發生，後由中國人管理時就無此現象。廣州某糖廠由貴國人經營時常常虧本，由中國人經營時就不虧本。又如京滬鐵路的秩序管理，在事變前本有模範鐵路之稱，現在則車票黑市，弊寶叢生。這些例子，當然不是說貴國人沒有能力，不會管理。實因貴國人尚未深刻瞭解中國國情與民情，以及當前的環境，所以每有自以爲是而行之非是的辦法，得不到結果的。　　素諗閣下抱具改善中日關係的熱忱，此來又有很誠摯的願望，多得到一些中國的實況，所以，不辭譾陋，率直獻言。敬祝健康　　　　陳彬龢　三十三年十月三日</p>
<h3>日陸海兩軍協力在福州東北登陸溫州方面日陸海軍獲聯絡</h3>
<p>東京三日中央社電　日大本營三日下午三時發表：日軍爲攻略中國東海沿岸要衝福州附近地區，於陸·海軍緊密協同下，九月二十七日地曉，於該市東北方海岸奇襲登陸，刻向廣州進擊中。　　東京三日中央社電　中國東南沿海海港中之厦門·汕頭，於事變初期相繼入於日軍掌握，九月九日溫州再度被日軍攻陷，目下所殘留者僅爲福建之福州而已。日陸·海軍精銳，於九月二十七日相互協力，復展開福州攻略作戰，陸海軍混合編成之日軍船團，於海軍艦艇掩護下，漸次接近福州沿海，二十七日黎明岱池河口（福州東北約四十公里）附近登陸上路，繼續進攻，到處粉碎渝軍抵抗。二十八日通過連池要衝後，繼續向福州前進。福州附近地守衛責任，乃由兼任省長劉建緒指揮之第七十軍担任，然於日軍電擊作戰下，唯有狼狽逃散，如福州一經日軍攻略成功，東南中國沿海之要衝，則全入日軍掌握，美軍企圖遮斷中國沿海至日本本土之連絡，此種企圖，因日軍此次先發制人之作戰而全被粉碎。又福州於民國三十年四月會一度被日軍攻陷，然於是年九月，日軍因已完成作戰目的，乃行自主撤退。　　日軍前綫三日中央社電　日陸軍精銳自九月七日佔領溫州後，渝第三戰區司令官顧祝同企圖奪回，日海軍察知此情，即於某日晚，由一部陸戰隊於溫州東方七里地帶登陸，其後渝軍奪回溫州之企圖愈漸暴露，故日陸·海軍部隊之聯絡亦積極進行，海軍部隊敢然打通該水路，終於一日完成，由是乃與溫州方面所在之日陸軍取得聯絡，而制壓渝軍之蠢動。</p>
<h3>桂林附近戰門激烈</h3>
<p>里斯本三日中央社電　據路愛社重慶訊：桂林東北方湘桂鐵道沿綫之戰鬥忽又激烈，其情形如次：渝軍司令部二日發表：興安（桂林東北五十公里）東南方於一日激烈忽又勃發，寶慶附近尚在戰鬥中。渝軍刻正開始向寶慶反擊，又於廣東省東部西江流域平南（梧州西方百零四公里）西關西北及丹竹附近繼續戰鬥中。又據合衆社訊，關於興安方面據渝軍司令部發表，桂林附近刻發生最激烈之戰鬥。其戰塲爲興安東南方七公里與十九公里之地點。又陷落之丹竹市及其附近及平南西南·西北地區，現亦繼續戰鬥中。　　廣州三日中央社電湘桂省境日軍精銳，刻於桂林東北之界首附近，整備攻略桂林態勢，將對桂林開始本格攻擊，渝方已傳桂林前哨據點之興安危機已迫。據渝方中央社三日桂林前綫消息，由界首附近沿桂林鐵路分二隊南下之日軍，業已開抵興安南方八公里之黎頭圩及九塊田，兩部隊於該地取得連絡後，渡越興安河，刻正激戰中。</p>
<h3>襲柳州等基地戰果</h3>
<p>廣州三日中央社電　據日軍前綫基地訊：日軍航空部隊，近呼應陸上部隊之進攻，空襲渝美空軍據點，已達最高潮，自九月二十三日以來，連夜猛炸柳州，計八日內所獲戰果，擊毀五十四架，再加入其間轟炸南寗，芷江等敵僅存機動基地之戰果，合計達七十六架，並炸毀陸上設施五處，破壞滑走路等，已予敵重創。茲誌九月下旬八日內日夜間轟炸機隊之戰果如下：柳州方面空襲六次，敵機三十二架中彈起火，二十二架被炸毀。南寗方面二架中彈起火，十一架被炸毀。芷江方面六架中彈起火，三架被炸毀，合計七十六架。又其間日方損失自炸一架，未返防一架。</p>
<h3>帛琉中央高地仍在激戰中</h3>
<p>其他諸島空襲趨頻繁　　東京三日中央社電帛琉島中央高地一帶，仍在激戰，一日晨敵軍來襲水府山日軍陣地，日軍當誘至陣前，予以重創，將其擊退，日將士之肉搏白刃戰，日來特在兩軍陣地中間地帶，張設鐵絲綱。又帛琉島北方之格亞特布斯島，亦仍在激戰，帛琉島之飛機塲，經敵軍連夜趕修，似已粗告平復，自二日起，敵軍小型機即開始使用該機塲。又安格維爾島戰況，日來無大變化，日守軍正繼續奮戰中　　東京三日中央社電西南太平洋日軍某基地二日電，敵機動部隊之進攻日軍西南太平洋方面諸基地，自馬尼刺空襲以來，稍趨緩和，但敵B２４B２５　P38　P40等機，由陸上基地空襲則趨頻繁，九月三十日之敵機空襲情況如下；凱衣羣島托阿羅方面，有敵中型小型機約六十架來襲，被擊落一架，西里伯並鍋著方面，有敵中型機四十餘架來襲，被擊落三架，肯達里方面，有敵戰鬥機轟炸機約四十架來襲，被擊落一架，安決方面有敵小型機十餘架來襲，新幾內亞西部巴金方面，有敵中型，小型機約計六十五架來襲，被擊落一架。</p>
<h3>田尻公使談菲律賓現狀</h3>
<p>東京三日中央社電日駐菲公使田尻愛義返東京後，二日就菲律賓現狀談稱：○菲律賓政府以九月二十一·二十二兩日之美機盲炸馬尼刺爲機，於全國宣布戒嚴令，繼之對美·英宣戰，因此菲律賓已直接担當起完遂大東亞戰爭，建設大東亞之光榮責務。○菲律賓頒布戒嚴令後，國家之一切權力，即統歸於戒嚴司令官之大總統，使大總統於非常時得有獨裁權，此乃菲律賓憲法第二條第九節之規定，菲律賓雖實施此獨裁體制，但毫未毀損獨立國家之實質。因公布戒嚴，故易於誤會菲律賓政治復歸日軍之手，置菲律賓於日本軍政下者，此乃完全誤解。由於戒嚴，菲律賓完遂戰爭，對日軍之協力體制，益爲完璧。○綜觀菲律賓情勢，國內非常時體制整備已畢，他方另由國民精神觀之，已走向戰時生活。</p>
<h3>美在太平洋補給益困難福萊斯特談作戰前途</h3>
<p>里斯本三日中央社電　據舊金山電，美海長福萊斯特，三十日說明太平洋作戰之前途稱：日主力艦隊依在健存，即陸軍亦仍擁有極大力量，而太平洋戰事之最大困難，係在於補給其所需要之補給力，將爲歐洲戰所需者之三倍，故其補給之困難，將隨美軍之前進而增大，且困難之增大率，與距離之境大，並不能成正比例，實遠超過補給綫之延長率也。</p>
<h3>美機襲琉黃島墜毀各一架</h3>
<p>東京三日中央社電據中部太平洋基地電，一日下午有美B24型機十架，來襲小笠原羣島之琉黃島，爲日軍擊落一架，擊毀一架，是日敵機遭日方猛烈攻擊，未能侵入該島上空，所投炸彈，均落於海中。</p>

<h3>亞琛前綫陸空大戰</h3>
<p>里斯本三日中央社電　西綫亞琛地區之戰機漸熟，企圖突破齊格斐綫之美第一軍之猛攻，遭遇德軍猛烈抵抗，德美空軍數百架各呼應地上部隊，展開壯烈之激戰。據美聯社關綫消息，反軸心軍自諾曼第半島登陸以來，此役爲最大之攻擊。反軸心傘兵在荷蘭安亭區慘遭殲滅，侵入德北部之企圖遂告失敗，現復由比領安特衛普，透恩擅特北面調遣加拿大軍，發動大攻勢，該方面戰況極應重視，認此乃西綫攻防戰中最有意義者。</p>
<h3>南段德軍頻施反攻</h3>
<p>南段貝爾福戰綫德軍刻正頻行反擊，在貝爾福東北十五里之倫向附近激戰後，美軍向貝爾福前進十里。　　里斯本三日中央社電　據路透社從軍記者訊：德軍已於安亨特里安中間之普倫西南開始反攻，美軍被迫放棄相當地區，斯特拉期堡附近德軍似有反攻之勢，自安亨至盧森堡東方德軍亦極爲活躍·</p>

<p>柏林三日中央社電德國社訊：昨日強大之蘇軍忽於愛沙尼亞西岸附近之達哥島北部登陸·（按該島在波羅的海內）德軍立刻迎擊，德艦隊亦阻擾蘇軍渡海交通。　　柏林三日中央社電海通社訊：現蘇軍攻擊之焦點爲在東南歐，蘇軍竭力鞏固其在羅保二國之地位，及開始大舉進攻南斯拉夫及洪牙利。數日來波羅的海蘇軍之攻擊已稍懈，德軍雖能由沃斯特蘭撤退至波海中區，但最重要者，爲蘇軍之佔領阿蘭羣島之芬蘭各機塲，並擬佔領里加灣之沃塞爾島·達哥島·及蒙島，現蒙鳥已被蘇軍佔領。蘇軍顯欲擴充其在波海區之勢力範圍。</p>
<h3>華沙波叛軍無條件投降</h3>
<p>柏林三日中央社電德國社訊：據此間官方今晨宣稱，華沙市內之波叛軍，頃已無條件投降，衣食不足之叛軍排成長隊而離開廢墟，狀至悽慘，叛軍餓斃於地窖中者極衆，叛軍中亦有婦孺。</p>

<h3>難民集渝人口激增</h3>
<p>中央社訊　日本空軍屢次不斷空襲成都，致重慶方面人心亦惴惴不安，自長沙·衡陽陷落以來，渝軍屢戰皆北，該處居民相率逃往重慶避難，一時人口激增，達二十萬人之衆，前經強制疏散人口之重慶，今又見行人充塞於途。即以九月份言，人口增加憶達四萬人，其主要理由，乃因渝方早已預料日軍必將進擊，故將桂林自行破壞所致，在美國指揮下，中國人民之家，爲本國軍隊所破壞，職業說喪失，致無家可歸之男女爲求生存，紛向重慶聚集。重慶人口增多後，房租物價無一不高漲，而避難者對於高局之措置，頗多責難，官方刻正感得難以應付。</p>
<h3>吞敵的氣魄</h3>
<p>— 德富蘇峰</p>
<p>又於私安三年十二月的教書中有如下的話：　　[速向彼處，嚴密注意：近年聞守護武臣，或因事務之爭論，或因訴訟之判決，多有不和，而不同心。只尋私隙，而不顧天下大難，何其不忠也。武臣以下軍兵等，從守護命，盡防戰之忠節。守護亦不以親疏論忠奸，行賞罰，凡叛命者，科　　忠之重刑。]　　由此觀之，可知他們之中很多是自己中心主義者，而並非是國家中心主義者。換言之，試觀時宗嚴責尋私隙而不顧天下大難之不忠，我們也可以知道當時決不全是忠義的。然而不管這些弱點，時宗竟拜受罰山太上皇及後宇多天皇之聖旨，終於拒敵國土之外。敵寇侵對馬，佔臺岐，進窺博多灣，任性殺掠。然而結果能驅逐一清的原因，決非單靠物量。當時我們日本軍隊，充其量不過五六萬人。敵方則有十五萬大軍，足有我方之三倍。何況他們還有火炮之武器，軍隊之編制。無論從那一點來看，敵方都佔優勢。然而我們日本，上則有龜山太上皇爲國難而祈禱之誠，下則有時宗獅子一吼，百獸驚服的偉大氣魄，於是將士用命，民心大振。最後幸因神風幫助，竟使敵寇葬身魚腹。　　我們再講一下第一次世界大戰的實例。當戰爭後半期時，在法國上無指導國論的政治家，下無陶冶兵士的將帥，敗戰論公然有人倡導，而失敗情緒充斥於全國。然克雷孟校一經就任內閣總理後，法國立刻像通上電流一樣，而復活了。主張敗戰論的功利主義政治家，不斷拘留起來。不管長官的命令，任意歸家，而鼓動工人罷工的軍隊，也成爲紀律嚴明的隊伍了。但與此相反，當時的德國雖然尚有奮鬥一年有半的力量，但德國本身的士氣自行頹廢，前此吞敵的氣魄，而現在爲敵人氣魄所吞，壓爲恐懼，終於驚慌失措而崩潰，因此而產生求僥倖的談判派。根據這一點來看，也可以知道戰爭勝改不單純決定於物量，而主要是有吞敵氣魄方始有物量。　　現在我們應當說者，即我們的盟邦德國，目前和東綫蘇聯死拚着，在法國南北和義大利北部，同盎格魯撒遜交綏着，去年有巴特里奧的義大利背叛於前，今年有皇黨的羅馬尼亞叛變於後，芬蘭與保加利亞由同盟國而變爲仇敵。此外土耳其放棄中立，而與德國斷交，西班牙和瑞典等中立國家，也一致發表停止向德輸出鋼鐵。過去以歐洲爲一個大堡壘的德國，現在只好以德國本身作爲堡壘了。如是，只要希特勒元首不氣餧而有吞敵的氣魄，則我們敢斷言，德國是一定會勝利的。今日的德國問題，是決定於希特勒及希特勒影響下的德國人民尚有否吞敵氣魄。　　日前地方長官會議時，天皇陛下會破例下賜御言：　　[戰局危急，關係皇國興替，今日汝曹地方長官，宜加倍激勵奮發，領導庶衆，使官民一體，向物心兩面充實，以扶佐皇運。]　　這並非單純賜予地方長官的御言，同時也是經過他們而賜予我們一億皇國民的御言，所以我們應當感激自勉。這就是我們履踐臣道的理由。正如天皇所說，今日的戰局，誠可謂危急了。然則我們用什麼來處理這一危急的戰局呢？所謂物心兩面的御言，下一註解，則就是食糧問題。食糧中，有物質食糧和精神食糧，物質食糧是充飢果腹的，精神食糧是充實吞敵氣魄的。無論在什麼時候，　肚皮是不能勞動的，所以充飢果腹是最要緊的。然而單純肚皮膨脹，而精神空空如也，則毫無用處，於是吞敵的氣魄，就非常需要。</p>

<h3>東亞民族重大關頭一致協力奮起</h3>
<p>宇垣大將來滬發表視察發表視察感想　　視察華北後，於本月一日來滬之日宇垣一成大將，三日下午六時，於其下榻之山下公館，會見記者團，發表其此行視察各地之感想，同時並謂據理如今其雖無須以老邁之身軀，奮勉努力，然因覺於現今之時局下，不可有一人遊手好閒，故勉力前至大陸方面，而思用功研究等，坦白發表其來滬後之談話如次：</p>
<h3>東亞民族一致協力</h3>
<p>鄙人本應退隱田舍，撫衛孫兒，以叙天倫之樂唯以現時局之情況，頗爲重大，余不耐久坐而袖手旁觀，覺此行或可成就，若何裨益國家之事實，而前來努力研究者也。觀今日情勢，日本正面臨興廢浮沉之關頭，固屬事實，然吾人須審察，今日日本之興廢浮沉，乃足以直接影響東亞全民族之興廢浮沉者也。僅將此視爲日本之問題，此點似終不足一提，滿洲國或中國各地民衆，不分老幼貴賤，由此觀點，究作若何設想，而於吾人宜作何感想，關於如何能打開此東亞危局之問題，余願公然毫無隱瞞彼此盡量交換意見。先就由自己會會見之人們所作之感想而述之，不論中國人或滿洲人，皆頗瞭解今日之時局，究屬日本單方面者，抑屬於全東亞者，殆均有異常堅強之感覺，而悉謂吾人相互之間，應各盡一臂之力不可。</p>
<h3>今後局勢更趨嚴重</h3>
<p>不論於國府或渝方之要人中，與余均相識者爲數不少，蔣介石於其第一次革命失敗而下野，逃亡至日本時，會前來訪余，而與余相識。故關於目前之情勢，亦當加以深思，縱將日本之勝敗，視作另一問題，而中國處於中國之地位觀察，今後之時代與今日之實情，亦屬當然。聞美軍現正開入重慶治下，目前一二萬人之程度，無論如何，今後將繼續有美軍之開入，則以後之情勢，顯然將趨於嚴重，大東亞之民族，惟目前始爲四百餘萬人一致擊潰英美之時代。</p>
<h3>滿洲方面活躍發展</h3>
<p>關於滿洲國方面，自滿洲建國以來，日本供給大批之人力與物質，努力於其活躍之發展—當時深恐果能善加將事，或無濟於事，但所獲之發展，乃全出乎預料之外，上下官民之秩序，至爲整然，並正在協力，大東亞戰爭之完成，可見本人之思慮，不過杞憂，且滿洲國頗可依賴，此爲日本最偉大之精神。在東京會聞華北尚有若干地方治安，未告恢復，事實誠屬如此，但此亦與今日之滿洲國在其成長以前之時期相同，不得不認爲係一種過程，當地華方軍官民，關於此點，均似在從事種種計劃，故最近之將來，當有如何之辦法。　　又宇垣大將預定於九日左右，由滬啓程赴蘇州，留宿一宵，翌日赴南京，或留二三日，再行返滬，約至十四五日在滬與各界要人，舉行懇談云。</p>
<h3>青少年團舉行國慶露營表演</h3>

<h3>地院奉令迅速辦案</h3>
<p>司法行政部鑒於法院辦理案件，每因各種手續關係，致多延擱，因此民衆所受痛苦，不可勝言，茲特訓令地檢署，以後凡由警察局解交該署案件，如案情判刑在五年以下者，當由地檢署立即加以偵查，如偵有確實證據者，翌日即行解送法院，當庭判決後，即送監獄執行，聞此項新辦法，業於昨日衆所受痛苦，不可勝言，茲特訓令地檢署，以後凡由警察局解交該署案件，如案情判刑在五年以下者，當由地檢署立即加以偵查，如偵有確實證據者，翌日即行解送法院，當庭判決後，即送監獄執行，聞此項新辦法，業於昨日起正式實行。</p>

<h3>警局計劃改善員警待遇加薪百分之一百</h3>
<p>本市警察局對於警政亟辦推進，同時對員警待遇，亦予設法改善，如消費合作社之設，採配各項必需品物資，實施配給，但尚不敷安定員警生活，茲據記者探悉，該局對員警之改善待遇問題，頗爲關注，幾經籌劃，將於最近期內予以增加，照原薪增百分之一百，惟須與財政當局商酌決定後，方可實施。</p>
<h3>公用局檢驗全市三輛車</h3>
<p>市公用局近以三輪車輛常有覆車情事，乘者受害非鮮，遂將全滬三輪車輛集中檢騐，凡○車身不潔有碍衛生者，○車胎及機件有損壞者，○有失觀膽者，均着即修理，否則將考慮禁止行駛，以保乘客安全。</p>

        <h1>1944 - n274</h1>
<h3>An Open Letter</h3>
<p>Mr. Ugaki: I have heard that you recently traveled from North China to Shanghai to examine the real conditions of our people, intending to use this as reference for further promoting Sino-Japanese relations. I deeply admire your diligence and arduous journey. Furthermore, after reading your impressions of your inspections in various places, I admire your grand aspirations even more. Standing as a person in the press in the private sector, I write this open letter to express what I want to say, which can also be said to be what some of our countrymen want to say. I hope you will not hesitate to give your guidance; it would be my great fortune. In the past two years or so, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War and the implementation of Japan's new policy towards China, many people from the government and public of your country have visited our country. This is a very gratifying phenomenon. However, it is regrettable that how many of your country's friends who come to China are able to delve deep into the Chinese private sector to examine the real conditions? And how many are able to listen to the opinions of the private sector? If one only looks around in Shanghai or lingers in a few large cities for a few days, engaging in social gatherings, one will not obtain any real information. Furthermore, if the promotion of Sino-Japanese relations is entrusted to the real conditions seen in this way, then the distance between the results obtained and the goals set will be very far. These are all facts, and we can easily prove them with a little review and reflection. When I visited your country last winter, I felt that too few people in the government and public of your country understood our country's situation, so I felt even more deeply apprehensive. On the other hand, in the past two years or so, too few people from our country have visited your country. Inconvenient transportation is certainly one reason. But another reason is that many people still have prejudices and are unwilling to go, unwilling to go. Therefore, the Greater East Asia Doctrine advocated by your country and the new policy towards China loudly proclaimed are still separated by a sea. The recognition within your country has certainly formed a passionate, widespread, profound, and genuine phenomenon, but very few people in our country can deeply understand it. Therefore, I must solemnly and sincerely point out: Under such circumstances, if your country wants to make the Chinese private sector understand, to have the same passionate, widespread, profound, and genuine understanding as within your country, then it must be demonstrated with facts on Chinese soil. I believe that how to promote Sino-Japanese cooperation to win the Greater East Asia War is currently the most important topic, and at the same time, it is our greatest responsibility. In the past two years or so, the government and public of your country have made many passionate contributions to winning the Greater East Asia War and liberating the shackles of the East Asian nations. At the same time, we greatly admire the fact that 100 million people in your country are constantly burying themselves in hard work. However, speaking of what efforts our country has made since participating in the war, I am very apprehensive and ashamed. However, the ambition of the British and American enemies has not been quelled, the Greater East Asia War is a long-term war, and the hardships ahead are foreseeable. If our country fails to contribute adequate strength in the war, then the responsibility will be even more arduous and significant. The current question is: What strength has China contributed to the Greater East Asia War in the past is questionable; and in terms of China's current situation, how much strength can it contribute in the future is even more questionable. Why do I say this? I believe that one can only wage war with production capacity, which is an unshakeable principle. And the people must obtain a minimum level of stable living before they can engage in production and wage war. However, from the reality of production, although slogans and plans for increasing production have been put forward, in fact, factors that reduce production arise at any time. For example, the reasons for reduced production in the industrial sector include a lack of raw materials, declining electricity, poor methods of purchasing materials, unrestricted transportation of materials, unreasonable price limits on finished products, etc. Secondly, the existence of economic regional division, with different currencies and different controls within the same country, hinders each other, making it impossible for material exchange to be smooth and for the national economy to develop in a balanced and unified manner. All factors that contribute to reduced production are due to the failure to fulfill one's duties in personnel matters, what is called [poor human planning]. For example, the materials of Central China and North China cannot be exchanged smoothly, coal, raw materials, transportation, etc., the Chinese are unable to handle them. Even if the Chinese are willing to produce and cooperate, they have no way to start. As for the issue of the people's minimum level of stable living, because prices are soaring without limit, life is difficult and painful, let alone stable. Currently, prices are 300 to 1200 times higher than seven years ago, and daily necessities are all more than 700 times higher. The general standard of living of the Chinese people has always been low and frugal, and the requirements are not extravagant. However, the current difficulties in life are mostly caused by man-made reasons, unnecessary suffering. However, the result of the people's increasingly painful life is giving an opportunity for the spread of communism, which is especially a major hidden danger in East Asia and must be given close attention. In short, the formation of all past problems is due to politics not being on the right track, insufficient understanding, and lack of conviction. The Chinese government and public should of course bear a major responsibility. However, the Japanese authorities also have a part of the responsibility. The single point that material exchanges cannot be smooth is enough to reduce production and increase prices. Therefore, I believe that several principles should be put forward: First, all undertakings in China that can be handled by the Chinese themselves should be handled by the Chinese themselves, and your country should be in a position to assist and guide. Second, the authority of each department in an undertaking must be unified. If the authority is not consistent, then the controlled economy will inevitably become chaotic and ineffective. Third, those from your country who participate in Chinese undertakings should be primarily first-class talents. Recently, I met with friends from your country who came here from Guangzhou and learned that when the Guangzhou Electric Lamp Factory was managed by people from your country, power outages and shortages often occurred, but when it was managed by the Chinese, this phenomenon disappeared. A certain sugar factory in Guangzhou often lost money when operated by people from your country, but it did not lose money when operated by the Chinese. Furthermore, the order management of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway was known as a model railway before the incident, but now there is a black market for tickets and many malpractices. These examples, of course, are not to say that people from your country do not have the ability and cannot manage. It is really because people from your country have not deeply understood the Chinese national conditions and people's sentiments, as well as the current environment, so they often have ways of doing things that they think are right but are not, and they do not get results. I have always known that you have a passion for improving Sino-Japanese relations, and this time you have a very sincere desire to obtain more real information about China, so I do not hesitate to be simple and straightforward in offering my advice. I respectfully wish you good health. Chen Binhe, October 3, Year 33</p>
<h3>Japanese Army and Navy Cooperate in Landing Northeast of Fuzhou, Japanese Army and Navy Obtain Contact in Wenzhou Area</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency telegram) The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:00 PM on the 3rd: The Japanese army, in order to capture the important area near Fuzhou on the coast of the East China Sea in China, under the close cooperation of the army and navy, landed in a surprise attack on the coast northeast of the city at dawn on September 27, and is currently attacking Guangzhou.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency telegram) Xiamen and Shantou, seaports on the southeastern coast of China, were successively brought under the control of the Japanese army in the early stages of the incident. Wenzhou was once again captured by the Japanese army on September 9. At present, only Fuzhou in Fujian remains. The elite of the Japanese army and navy, cooperating with each other on September 27, once again launched the Fuzhou capture operation. The Japanese fleet, a mixed formation of the army and navy, gradually approached the coast of Fuzhou under the cover of naval vessels and landed at the mouth of the Daichi River (approximately 40 kilometers northeast of Fuzhou) at dawn on the 27th, continuing to attack and crushing the resistance of the Chongqing army everywhere. On the 28th, after passing through the important Lianchi point, they continued to advance towards Fuzhou. The responsibility for defending the area near Fuzhou was borne by the 70th Army, commanded by Liu Jianxu, who also served as the provincial governor. However, under the Japanese army's blitzkrieg tactics, they could only flee in a state of disarray. Once Fuzhou is successfully captured by the Japanese army, all the important points on the southeastern coast of China will be under the control of the Japanese army. The American attempt to cut off the connection between the Chinese coast and the Japanese mainland has been completely crushed by the Japanese army's preemptive operation this time. Furthermore, Fuzhou was once captured by the Japanese army in April of the 30th year of the Republic of China, but in September of that year, the Japanese army carried out a voluntary withdrawal after completing its operational objectives.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Frontline, 3rd (Central News Agency telegram) After the elite of the Japanese army occupied Wenzhou on September 7, Gu Zhutong, commander of the Chongqing Third War Zone, attempted to retake it. The Japanese navy, aware of this situation, landed a unit of marines in the Qili area east of Wenzhou one night. After that, the Chongqing army's attempt to retake Wenzhou became increasingly exposed, so the Japanese army and navy units actively carried out contact. The navy units boldly opened up the waterway, finally completing it one day, thereby establishing contact with the Japanese army stationed in the Wenzhou area and suppressing the Chongqing army's recklessness.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting Near Guilin</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency telegram) According to Reuters' Chongqing dispatch: The fighting along the Xiang-Gui Railway northeast of Guilin suddenly intensified again, with the situation as follows: The Chongqing military headquarters announced on the 2nd: Fierce fighting suddenly broke out again on the 1st southeast of Xing'an (50 kilometers northeast of Guilin), and fighting is still ongoing near Baoqing. The Chongqing army is currently launching a counterattack towards Baoqing, and fighting continues in the Xiguan northwest and Danzhu vicinity of Pingnan (104 kilometers west of Wuzhou) in the eastern part of Guangdong Province. According to the Associated Press, regarding the Xing'an area, the Chongqing military headquarters announced that the fiercest fighting is currently taking place near Guilin. The battlefield is located 7 kilometers and 19 kilometers southeast of Xing'an. Furthermore, fighting is also continuing in and around the fallen city of Danzhu and in the southwest and northwest areas of Pingnan. Guangzhou, 3rd (Central News Agency telegram) The elite of the Japanese army in the Xiang-Gui provincial border is currently preparing to capture Guilin near Jieshou, northeast of Guilin, and will launch a full-scale attack on Guilin. The Chongqing side has reported that the crisis at Xing'an, the outpost of Guilin, is imminent. According to a Central News Agency Guilin front-line dispatch on the 3rd from the Chongqing side, the Japanese army, which had divided into two teams near Jieshou and moved south along the Guilin Railway, has already arrived at Litouwei and Jiukuaida, 8 kilometers and 9 kilometers south of Xing'an, respectively. After the two units established contact at that location, they crossed the Xing'an River and are currently engaged in fierce fighting.</p>
<h3>Results of Raids on Liuzhou and Other Bases</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 3rd (Central News Agency telegram) According to a dispatch from the Japanese army's front-line base: The Japanese air force, recently echoing the advance of ground troops, has reached its climax in air raids on Chongqing-American air force bases. Since September 23, it has been bombing Liuzhou fiercely night after night. The results achieved in eight days include the destruction of 54 aircraft. Adding to this the results of bombing Nanning, Zhijiang, and other enemy mobile bases, the total reaches 76 aircraft. In addition, five ground facilities were destroyed and runways were damaged, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. The results of the bomber squadrons' day and night bombing in the last eight days of September are recorded as follows: Air raids on the Liuzhou area were carried out six times, with 32 enemy aircraft being hit and catching fire, and 22 being destroyed. In the Nanning area, two aircraft were hit and caught fire, and eleven were destroyed. In the Zhijiang area, six aircraft were hit and caught fire, and three were destroyed, totaling 76 aircraft. In addition, the Japanese side lost one aircraft due to self-destruction and one aircraft failed to return.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting Continues in the Central Highlands of Palau</h3>
<p>Air Raids on Other Islands Becoming More Frequent</p>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency telegram) Fierce fighting is still ongoing in the central highlands of Palau Island. On the morning of the 1st, enemy troops attacked the Japanese army's position on Mount Suifu. The Japanese army lured them to the front of the position and inflicted heavy damage, repelling them. The Japanese soldiers' melee combat with bayonets has been particularly intense in the area between the two armies' positions, where barbed wire has been erected. Furthermore, fierce fighting is also still ongoing on Geatrubs Island, north of Palau Island. The airfield on Palau Island has been roughly restored after the enemy army rushed repairs at night, and enemy small aircraft have begun using the airfield since the 2nd. Furthermore, the battle situation on Angaur Island has not changed much in recent days, and the Japanese garrison is continuing to fight bravely. Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency telegram) A dispatch from a certain Japanese base in the Southwest Pacific on the 2nd states that the enemy mobile unit's attacks on Japanese bases in the Southwest Pacific have eased slightly since the air raids on Manila, but enemy B24, B25, P38, P40, etc., aircraft have been conducting increasingly frequent air raids from land bases. The enemy aircraft air raid situation on September 30 was as follows: In the Toaroe area of the Kai Islands, approximately 60 enemy medium and small aircraft attacked, one of which was shot down. In the Siri Bo and Guo Zhu areas, approximately 40 enemy medium aircraft attacked, three of which were shot down. In the Kendari area, approximately 40 enemy fighter-bombers attacked, one of which was shot down. In the Anjue area, more than ten enemy small aircraft attacked. In the Bajjin area of western New Guinea, approximately 65 enemy medium and small aircraft attacked, one of which was shot down.</p>
<h3>Minister Tajiri Discusses the Current Situation in the Philippines</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency telegram) Japanese Minister to the Philippines, Aiyi Tajiri, after returning to Tokyo, discussed the current situation in the Philippines on the 2nd, stating: ○ The Philippine government, taking advantage of the blind bombing of Manila by American aircraft on September 21 and 22, declared martial law throughout the country, followed by a declaration of war on the United States and Britain. Therefore, the Philippines has directly undertaken the glorious responsibility of completing the Greater East Asia War and building Greater East Asia. ○ After the Philippines promulgated martial law, all powers of the country were统统归于the President, who is the martial law commander, giving the President dictatorial powers in times of emergency. This is stipulated in Section 9 of Article 2 of the Philippine Constitution. Although the Philippines has implemented this dictatorial system, it has not damaged the essence of an independent country. Because of the announcement of martial law, it is easy to misunderstand that Philippine politics have reverted to the hands of the Japanese army, placing the Philippines under Japanese military administration. This is a complete misunderstanding. Due to martial law, the Philippines' completion of the war and the cooperation system with the Japanese army have become more perfect. ○ Looking at the overall situation in the Philippines, the emergency system in the country has been completed, and on the other hand, from the perspective of the national spirit, it has moved towards wartime life.</p>
<h3>America's Supply in the Pacific Becomes More Difficult, Forrestal Discusses the Future of the War</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency telegram) According to a San Francisco dispatch, American Secretary of the Navy Forrestal explained the future of the Pacific War on the 30th, stating: The Japanese main fleet is still intact, and the army still possesses great strength. The greatest difficulty in the Pacific War is in supplying its needs. The required supply capacity will be three times that required for the European War. Therefore, the difficulty of its supply will increase with the advance of the American army, and the rate of increase in difficulty is far beyond the rate of extension of the supply line, not directly proportional to it.</p>
<h3>One American Aircraft Crashes and One Is Destroyed off Iwo Jima</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency telegram) According to a dispatch from a base in the Central Pacific, on the afternoon of the 1st, ten American B24 aircraft attacked Iwo Jima in the Ogasawara Islands, one of which was shot down and one was destroyed by the Japanese army. On that day, the enemy aircraft were subjected to fierce attacks by the Japanese side and failed to enter the airspace of the island. All the bombs dropped fell into the sea.</p>
<h3>Japan Dispatches Mr. Yamashita as Administrative Inspector</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency telegram) In order to strengthen the maritime transport capacity of the Seto Inland Sea, the Japanese government has decided to dispatch Cabinet Advisor Saburo Yamashita as Administrative Inspector, implementing administrative inspection from the 4th. It is understood that Administrative Inspector Yamashita, with the qualifications of the 7th Inspector, inspected the matter of strengthening transportation between mainland China and inland Japan this April.</p>
<h3>Germany Fully Defends Its Territory, Great Decisive Battle Imminent, Anti-Axis Offensive Focuses on Both Wings</h3>
<p>Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency telegram) German News from the Frontline: The American Third Army in the Metz area is continuing to gather troops and heavy weapons, and at the same time actively preparing supply lines. The battle opportunity for the anti-Axis forces to begin attacking the Siegfried Line is imminent. The German authorities are also fully aware of this tense situation, so they first used a fierce counterattack to close the breakthrough point of the American army east of Metz, and immediately blew up all the large bridges of a certain canal, preparing countermeasures for the great decisive battle.</p>
<h3>Large-Scale Land and Air Battle on the Aachen Frontline</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency telegram) The battle opportunity in the Aachen area of the Western Front is gradually ripening. The fierce attack by the American First Army, attempting to break through the Siegfried Line, has encountered fierce resistance from the German army. Hundreds of German and American aircraft are responding to the ground troops, unfolding a magnificent and fierce battle. According to Associated Press frontline news, this battle is the largest attack since the anti-Axis forces landed on the Normandy Peninsula. Anti-Axis paratroopers were annihilated in the Anting area of the Netherlands, and the attempt to invade northern Germany failed. Now, Canadian troops are being transferred from Antwerp, Belgium, to the north of Teunant, launching a major offensive. The situation in that area is extremely important and is considered the most meaningful in the defensive-offensive battle on the Western Front.</p>
<h3>German Forces in the South Frequent Counterattacks</h3>
<p>German forces in the Belfort frontline in the south are currently conducting frequent counterattacks. After fierce fighting near Lun, fifteen miles northeast of Belfort, the American army advanced ten miles towards Belfort. Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency telegram) According to a dispatch from a Reuters war correspondent: The German army has begun a counterattack southwest of Pluen, between Anhun and Telian. The American army was forced to abandon a considerable area. Near Strasbourg, the German army seems to have a tendency to counterattack. The German army is also extremely active from Anhun to east of Luxembourg.</p>
<h3>Soviet Troops Land on Dago Island in the Baltic Sea</h3>
<p>Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency telegram) German News Agency dispatch: Yesterday, strong Soviet troops suddenly landed on the northern part of Dago Island, near the west coast of Estonia. (Note: The island is in the Baltic Sea.) The German army immediately counterattacked, and the German fleet also blocked the Soviet army's sea transportation. Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency telegram) Haitian News Agency dispatch: Currently, the focus of the Soviet army's attack is in Southeast Europe. The Soviet army is trying to consolidate its position in Romania and Bulgaria and has begun a major offensive against Yugoslavia and Hungary. In recent days, the Soviet army's attacks in the Baltic Sea have eased slightly. Although the German army was able to withdraw from Worcesterland to the central area of the Baltic Sea, the most important thing is that the Soviet army's occupation of Finnish airfields on the Aland Islands and its intention to occupy the Worcester Island, Dago Island, and Monk Island in the Gulf of Riga. Currently, Monk Island has been occupied by the Soviet army. The Soviet army clearly wants to expand its sphere of influence in the Baltic Sea.</p>

<h3>Chongqing Political Council Dispatches Investigation Team to Yan'an</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency telegram) The Chongqing-Yan'an reconciliation negotiations, based on the report of the representatives in the National Political Council meeting on September 5, after open discussion, it was decided that the Political Council would dispatch a four- or five-person investigation team to investigate the real situation in the Yan'an area and then submit necessary recommendations to the Chongqing side. However, according to a Chongqing dispatch, Lin Zuhan, the Yan'an representative who did not compromise with the Chongqing side, and Dong Biwu, the permanent representative in Chongqing, are scheduled to leave Chongqing this week. The five members of the National Political Council investigation team will also travel to Yan'an on the same route.</p>
<h3>Refugees Gather in Chongqing, Population Increases Sharply</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch: The Japanese air force has repeatedly and continuously raided Chengdu, causing unease in Chongqing. Since the fall of Changsha and Hengyang, the Chongqing army has been repeatedly defeated, and the residents there have flocked to Chongqing to seek refuge, causing a sudden surge in population, reaching 200,000 people. Chongqing, which had previously forcibly dispersed the population, is now seeing pedestrians filling the streets again. Taking September as an example, the population has increased by 40,000 people. The main reason is that the Chongqing side had long anticipated that the Japanese army would definitely advance, so they destroyed Guilin themselves. Under the command of the United States, the homes of the Chinese people are destroyed by their own army, and occupations are lost, causing homeless men and women to gather in Chongqing in order to survive. After the population of Chongqing increased, rents and prices have risen without exception, and the refugees have criticized the government's measures to deal with the high prices. Officials are currently feeling overwhelmed.</p>
<h3>The Spirit of Devouring the Enemy</h3>
<p>— Tokutomi Sohō</p>
<p>Furthermore, in a teaching from December of the third year of Shian (1270), there were the following words: [Quickly go there and pay close attention: In recent years, I have heard that the warrior vassals responsible for defense are often discordant and disunited due to disputes over affairs or judgments in lawsuits. They only seek private grievances and do not care about the great calamities facing the nation. How disloyal they are! Military personnel and soldiers below them should obey the orders of their lords and wholeheartedly defend the nation. Lords should not judge loyalty based on personal relationships but reward and punish fairly. Those who disobey orders should be severely punished.] From this, it can be seen that many of them were ego-centric rather than nation-centric. In other words, observing Tokimune's stern condemnation of those who sought private grievances and disregarded the great calamities facing the nation, we can also know that not everyone at that time was loyal and righteous. However, regardless of these weaknesses, Tokimune received the imperial decrees of the retired Emperor Kameyama and Emperor Go-Uda and ultimately repelled the enemy from the nation's territory. The enemy invaded Tsushima, occupied Tagi, and threatened Hakata Bay, indulging in wanton killing and plunder. However, the reason they were eventually driven out completely was not solely due to material resources. At that time, the Japanese army numbered at most only fifty or sixty thousand. The enemy, on the other hand, had an army of one hundred and fifty thousand, three times the size of ours. Moreover, they had firearms and a well-organized military structure. From any perspective, the enemy held the advantage. However, Japan, with the sincerity of the retired Emperor Kameyama praying for the nation's plight from above, and Tokimune's great spirit that made all beasts tremble with a lion's roar from below, inspired the soldiers to fight bravely and boosted the morale of the people. Finally, thanks to the divine wind, the enemy was buried in the bellies of fish. Let us discuss an example from World War I. During the latter half of the war, France had no political leaders with a guiding national ideology and no generals capable of cultivating soldiers. Talk of defeat was openly advocated, and a sense of failure permeated the entire country. However, once Clemenceau became Prime Minister, France was revitalized as if electrified. Utilitarian politicians who advocated defeat were constantly detained. Soldiers who ignored their superiors' orders, arbitrarily returned home, and incited workers to strike became disciplined troops. In contrast, Germany at that time, although still had the strength to fight for another year and a half, its own morale declined spontaneously. The spirit of devouring the enemy was replaced by being devoured by the enemy's spirit, overwhelmed by fear, and ultimately collapsed in panic, leading to the emergence of a negotiation faction seeking to escape through luck. From this, we can also know that victory in war is not solely determined by material resources but primarily by having the spirit to devour the enemy, which then leads to the acquisition of material resources. What we should say now is that our ally, Germany, is currently fighting to the death with the Soviet Union on the Eastern Front and engaging in skirmishes with the Anglo-Saxons in France and Northern Italy. Last year, Italy, led by Badoglio, betrayed them, and this year, Romania, with its royalist party, defected. Finland and Bulgaria have changed from allies to enemies. Furthermore, Turkey abandoned its neutrality and severed diplomatic relations with Germany, and neutral countries such as Spain and Sweden have unanimously announced the cessation of steel exports to Germany. Germany, which used to be a large fortress in Europe, now has to rely on Germany itself as a fortress. If only Führer Hitler does not lose heart and has the spirit to devour the enemy, then we dare to assert that Germany will definitely win. The problem with Germany today lies in whether Hitler and the German people under Hitler's influence still have the spirit to devour the enemy. At the recent conference of local officials, His Majesty the Emperor exceptionally bestowed imperial words: [The war situation is critical, concerning the rise and fall of the imperial nation. Today, you local officials should redouble your efforts to inspire and lead the common people, so that officials and civilians are united in replenishing both material and spiritual resources to support the imperial destiny.] These are not merely imperial words bestowed upon local officials, but also imperial words bestowed upon our one hundred million imperial subjects through them, so we should be grateful and encourage ourselves. This is the reason why we fulfill our duties as subjects. As the Emperor said, today's war situation can truly be called critical. So, what should we use to handle this critical war situation? The so-called imperial words of "both material and spiritual resources," when annotated, refer to the food problem. Among food, there is material food and spiritual food. Material food fills the stomach, while spiritual food fills the spirit of devouring the enemy. At any time, the stomach cannot be idle, so filling the stomach is the most important thing. However, simply having an inflated stomach while the spirit is empty is useless, so the spirit of devouring the enemy is very necessary.</p>

<h3>East Asian Nations Must Unite and Rise Up at This Critical Juncture</h3>
<p>General Ueki's Impressions After Inspecting North China</p>
<p>General Kazushige Ugaki, who arrived in Shanghai on the first of this month after inspecting North China, met with a group of reporters at his residence, the Yamashita Mansion, at 6:00 PM on the third. He shared his thoughts after inspecting various places and stated that, although he did not need to exert himself due to his age, he felt that no one should be idle in the current situation. Therefore, he had ventured to the mainland to study the situation diligently. He frankly shared his views after arriving in Shanghai as follows:</p>
<h3>East Asian Nations Must Unite</h3>
<p>I should have retired to the countryside to play with my grandchildren and enjoy family life. However, the current situation is very critical, and I could not bear to sit idly by. I felt that this trip might lead to something that could benefit the nation, so I came to study the situation diligently. It is a fact that Japan is facing a critical juncture of rise and fall. However, we must understand that Japan's rise and fall directly affects the rise and fall of all East Asian nations. Considering this only as Japan's problem is not worth mentioning. People in Manchuria and various parts of China, regardless of age or social status, should consider this from this perspective and think about what they should think of us. Regarding the issue of how to break through this East Asian crisis, I am willing to openly and without any concealment exchange opinions as much as possible. First, I will share the thoughts of the people I have met. Whether Chinese or Manchurian, they all understand the current situation. Whether it belongs to Japan alone or to all of East Asia, they all have an unusually strong feeling and say that we should each do our part.</p>
<h3>The Future Situation Will Become More Severe</h3>
<p>Many of the important figures in both the National Government and the Chongqing faction are acquainted with me. Chiang Kai-shek came to visit me and became acquainted with me when he fled to Japan after his first revolution failed and he went into hiding. Therefore, we should also think deeply about the current situation. Even if Japan's victory or defeat is seen as another issue, and China observes from China's position, the future era will naturally be different from today's reality. I heard that American troops are currently entering the area under Chongqing's control. No matter how many, even if it is only one or two thousand, more American troops will continue to enter in the future. Then, the future situation will obviously become more severe. The nations of Greater East Asia, only now, are four hundred million people united to defeat Britain and the United States.</p>
<h3>Active Development in Manchuria</h3>
<p>Regarding Manchuria, since the establishment of Manchuria, Japan has provided a large amount of manpower and material resources and has been working hard for its active development. At that time, I was deeply afraid that even if we did our best, it would be useless. However, the development that has been achieved has exceeded all expectations. The order of officials and civilians, both high and low, is very orderly, and they are working together to complete the Greater East Asia War. It can be seen that my concerns were just unnecessary worries, and Manchuria is quite reliable. This is Japan's greatest spirit. In Tokyo, I heard that the security of some areas in North China has not yet been restored. This is indeed the case, but this is also the same as the period before the growth of Manchuria today. We have to recognize it as a process. Local Chinese military officers and civilians seem to be engaged in various plans regarding this point. Therefore, in the near future, there will be some way to deal with it. Furthermore, General Ugaki is scheduled to leave Shanghai for Suzhou around the ninth, stay there overnight, and go to Nanjing the next day. He may stay there for two or three days before returning to Shanghai. He is expected to hold a cordial discussion with key figures from all walks of life in Shanghai around the fourteenth or fifteenth.</p>
<h3>Youth Corps Holds National Day Camping Performance</h3>
<p>Forty-Nine Battalions from Fifteen Schools Participate</p>
<p>To celebrate the 33rd National Day Commemorative Festival, the city's Bureau of Education and the city headquarters of the Youth Corps decided to hold a camping performance for the Youth Corps. The date is from 2:00 PM on September 9th to 5:00 PM on September 10th, and the camp is the Racecourse on Jing'an Temple Road. It has been learned that at 5:00 PM on September 30th, the city's Bureau of Education and the city headquarters of the Youth Corps will jointly hold a preparatory meeting for the camping performance. More than 20 instructors from the headquarters of each school district will attend. First, Deputy Commander Xi will report the purpose of the meeting, and then Director Dai of the Education Bureau will give instructions. Then, the discussion will begin. The following important items have been decided: ○ The commander of the camping performance is Mayor Chen, and the deputy commanders are Director Dai and Deputy Commander Xi. ○ The camp directors are Shen Zhaofeng, Wu Pengfei, and Qian Boping. ○ The participating units in the camping include 15 schools and 49 battalions. ○ The performance programs will be proposed by each unit and then scheduled. The headquarters of the third district (Nanshi) of the China Youth Corps Shanghai Special City Headquarters has been ordered to adjust the position of commander of the district headquarters and appoint Mr. Cheng Hanqing as the successor. The deputy commanders will be Shen Shijing and Cheng Deliang.</p>
<h3>District Court Ordered to Expedite Cases</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Justice Administration, in light of the fact that court cases are often delayed due to various procedural matters, causing unspeakable suffering to the people, has specifically instructed the District Prosecutor's Office that, in the future, for all cases handed over to the office by the police station, if the sentence is five years or less, the District Prosecutor's Office should immediately investigate. If there is solid evidence, the case should be sent to the court for judgment the next day, and after the judgment, it should be sent to the prison for execution. It is heard that this new measure was formally implemented yesterday.</p>
<h3>Transfer of District Baojia Completed</h3>
<p>The affairs of the Nanshi, Pudong, Zhabei, and Xujiahui baojia districts in this city, after being transferred from the Municipal Baojia Committee to the Baojia Department of the Municipal Police Bureau, have been taken over by the department's selected personnel on the 29th and 30th of last month. Except for the Xujiahui district, which is taken over by the Western District Office of the Baojia Department, the Nanshi, Pudong, and Zhabei three district offices are established separately. Director Gu personally serves as the director of the three offices and appoints Section Chief Xiao Gang as the deputy director of the Nanshi District Office, Section Chief Chen Jiufeng as the deputy director of the Zhabei District Office, and Huang Xiaoping as the deputy director of the Pudong District Office. Each office will begin operations today.</p>
<h3>Police Bureau Plans to Improve Police Treatment and Increase Salaries by 100%</h3>
<p>The Municipal Police Bureau is eager to promote police administration and is also working to improve the treatment of police officers. For example, the establishment of consumer cooperatives and the distribution of various necessities and supplies have been implemented, but it is still not enough to stabilize the lives of police officers. According to a reporter's investigation, the bureau is very concerned about the issue of improving the treatment of police officers and, after several plans, will increase salaries by 100% of the original salary in the near future. However, this must be discussed and decided with the financial authorities before it can be implemented.</p>
<h3>Public Utilities Bureau Inspects All Rickshaws in the City</h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau has recently been focusing on the frequent overturning of rickshaws, which has caused harm to passengers. Therefore, it will concentrate on inspecting all rickshaws in Shanghai. Those whose ○ body is unclean and affects hygiene, ○ tires and parts are damaged, and ○ are unsightly will be ordered to repair them immediately. Otherwise, it will consider prohibiting them from operating to protect passenger safety.</p>
<h3>Health Authorities Prepare for Vaccination</h3>
<p>The municipal health authorities, in view of the fact that the weather is turning cooler and a few infants have been infected with smallpox, have decided to end the second phase of cholera prevention injections early as a precautionary measure. They are now actively preparing to start vaccination work in mid-month.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Sets Office Hours</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government believes that the summer vacation has passed and the summer office hours should be abolished. However, to adapt to the current environment, the office hours of its affiliated bureaus, departments, committees, and offices are set from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 1:00 PM to 4:30 PM daily.</p>
<h3>Motor Vehicle Permits Begin to Be Issued</h3>
<p>Since the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau closed the receipt of applications for the 15th period of continued operation permits for motor vehicles on the 25th of last month, it has been actively sorting out and reviewing the reasons for each application. It was completed on the 1st of this month and has now begun to issue the 15th period of operation permits. The permit is a blue diamond shape, slightly different from the round shape of the 14th period. Vehicle owners in the city can go to the third section of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau on Changning Road from now until the 9th, from 9:30 AM to 12:00 PM and from 1:30 PM to 4:30 PM, with their seal to collect the permit. The validity period of the 14th period operation permit expires on the 9th and will be invalid after the deadline. ○ Nanjing Xingye Bank Shanghai Branch Opens Today Nanjing Xingye Bank was founded in June 1940 as the first bank established after the National Government returned to the capital. It has the first license issued by the Ministry of Finance. It built a new building in Nanjing, which is magnificent and beautiful. For five years, under the proper management of Mr. Jin Xiongbo, Chairman and General Manager of the bank, it has enjoyed an outstanding reputation and is one of the leading banks in the capital. The Shanghai branch originally had an office at 2 Avenue Albert, which opened for business at the same time as the Nanjing branch. Recently, due to the development of its business, it has been approved by the Ministry of Finance to establish a Shanghai branch. Mr. Jin also holds the position of manager. It is scheduled to officially open today (4th). With Mr. Jin's wide network of contacts and the solid foundation of the bank in the past, it is expected that the large number of deposits from all parties will make a unique contribution to the financial community. ○ Central Insurance Company Opens Central Insurance Co., Ltd. held its opening ceremony yesterday (3rd) at 10:00 AM at its new address at 74 Dianchi Road. More than 1,000 Chinese and foreign guests went to congratulate them, including Li Sihao, Wen Lanting, Lin Kanghou, Ye Fuxiao, and others, as well as Counselor Nakada, representative of Minister Usami of the friendly nation. Chairman Zhou Fohai delivered the opening speech, stating that the government established the Central Insurance Company to maintain the stability of industrial and commercial assets and stabilize the domestic economy, and did not compete with ordinary commercial companies for profits. He hoped that commercial colleagues would cooperate closely with the company to form a united front so that the entire insurance industry could develop in a regular manner.

It has taken in orphans and provided them with work-study programs, creating benefits for the community and the nation. At a time when prices are rising sharply, the home's educational expenses are limited. Therefore, it has launched the fifth fundraising campaign to raise 10 million yuan from enthusiastic philanthropists from all walks of life in the city and to establish a farm in Anting and other places in Shanghai. It is hoped that enthusiastic people will show compassion and help the children. At 3:00 PM yesterday (3rd), the home specially invited news reporters from the city. The director of the home, Lin Kanghou, the director of education, Zheng Peng, and staff members provided the utmost hospitality and reported on the recent educational situation and the fundraising process on the spot.

<h3>The Educational Character of the Old Shanghai Municipal Council Chinese Children's Schools</h3>
<p>— —Yatai Tada</p>
<p>○Science Equipment: Most schools have quite abundant natural science experimental equipment. When secondary school students conduct experiments, each group has its own set of equipment, allowing them to see and touch them easily. Currently, the central science laboratory's various instruments are based on the science equipment of Yucai Public School. The adequacy of the school's equipment in this department is evident. In summary, the most noteworthy aspect is that most of the schools' equipment was acquired at the time of the schools' establishment. Subsequent additions or new acquisitions were extremely difficult because the budget for the municipal schools only included an item for experimental [materials] and not for [equipment]. Before the incident, this was limited to just over a hundred yuan per year, mostly restricted to the needs of experimental consumables. It was exceedingly difficult to obtain new [equipment]. To add [equipment], regardless of price, it had to be included in the temporary budget the previous year. After approval by the finance department, the principal would solicit bids (at least three bids) the following year. These bids would then be submitted to the education department for approval before an order could be placed. This cumbersome process often meant that nothing could be added for a year and a half. During times of unrest and fluctuating prices, the Chinese Education Department would advocate for the self-manufacture of simple school equipment and teaching aids. While this served as an educational exercise, it also tended to make the self-manufacture of teaching aids an educational goal in itself. This may have also been due to the aforementioned reasons. (Eight) Conclusion: The former Shanghai Municipal Council's Chinese children's primary and secondary schools have a relatively long history in the vertical dimension and a relatively high social status in the horizontal dimension. Adopting strengths and discarding weaknesses, selecting the essence and applying it broadly, and adapting to the times to meet the needs of the era are what the education sector must understand deeply. Furthermore, it is crucial not to overlook the educational characteristics of Chinese children's schools to improve or maintain Shanghai's cultural standards. Despite my limited knowledge, I have drafted this article. Omissions and errors are inevitable. I hope that knowledgeable gentlemen will provide guidance. Note 1: Chinese children's schools refer to four boys' secondary schools, one girls' secondary school, and seven primary schools. The boys' secondary schools are all called "Public Schools." The Nie Zhongcheng, Gezhi, Yucai, and Huatong schools are collectively referred to as Chinese Children's Secondary Schools. The other four night schools, one people's school, and one workers' technical school are not included in this discussion. Note 2: The education authorities made the following remarks regarding the old Chinese children's schools from February 20th to 25th: ○ All personnel matters regarding the old principals and affiliated institutions' teachers and staff will remain unchanged, and their treatment will be maintained as before. ○ The existing excellent systems will be preserved and will not be changed arbitrarily. ○ Other Notes 3: In 1930 (the 19th year of the Republic of China), the Shanghai Municipal Council's Education Committee resolved on an "Eight-Year Education Plan." Its main points are as follows: ○ The purpose of the Shanghai Municipal Council's education plan is to provide appropriate schools and educational opportunities to the children of citizens who directly or indirectly pay taxes in the concession, regardless of nationality. However, the Shanghai Municipal Council does not solely bear the responsibility for educating citizens. All government agencies, public and private organizations, and religious groups, or legal individuals, are welcome to establish schools in the Public Concession. ○ The Bureau will provide assistance when appropriate to the aforementioned schools that have been established and meet the standards to strengthen their effectiveness and work together for citizen education. ○ The Shanghai Municipal Council will continue to maintain and add to the Western children's schools and Chinese children's schools it has established. ○ From 1931 to 1936, two primary schools capable of accommodating 600 children will be opened each year. By the end of 1938, including the original three primary schools, there will be a total of seventeen Shanghai Municipal Council primary schools. ○ In addition, the Shanghai Municipal Council must open two girls' secondary schools. The first will open in 1931, and the second must be established before 1934. ○ The existing four Chinese Children's Public Schools should be gradually adjusted according to secondary school standards to become standard secondary schools. At least one of them should have the basic conditions of a vocational or technical school. ○ By the end of 1938, the Shanghai Municipal Council should have a total of twenty-three Chinese primary and secondary schools. The students enrolled will account for 7.5% of the total number of school-age Chinese children in the entire concession. ○ Regarding subsidies for private schools, the Shanghai Municipal Council provides financial assistance to private schools within the concession that meet the prescribed standards for educational level, equipment, and management, and are in need of financial assistance. All subsidized schools must be located within the Public Concession or pay taxes to the Shanghai Municipal Council. The amount of the subsidy is determined by the school's performance, financial needs, and the number of students enrolled. Note 4: See the Shanghai Municipal Council's General Office Circular (with revisions made after the Incident), the Shanghai Municipal Council's Provisional Regulations for Primary Schools, and its supplementary compilation. Note 5: See the Shanghai Municipal Council Gazette of 1935. Notes 6 and 7: See the Shanghai Municipal Council General Office Circular and Annual Report. (End of Full Text)</p>
