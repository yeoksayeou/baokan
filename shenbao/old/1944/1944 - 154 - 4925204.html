<h3>社評　上海人的覺悟　先公後私？先私後公？只私無公？</h3>
<p>昨天市諮詢委員會曁各公園招待陳市長以次各長官，席間由主席季思浩氏致次，略謂上海市政進展，在平時已經要共同努力，在此戰時，更須共同努力，才能克服一切困難。我們很同意這一見解。　　　　我們會經說過，凡是居住於上海市者，都是上海市民，廣義的範圍，應該包括朝野中外人士。如果說上海市一切問題的解決，是上海市民全體的責任，有賴於上海市民的共同努力者，那未，朝野中外人士都有其應有的責任，都應該努力盡其應盡的責任。怎樣盡其應盡的責任呢？首先應有「先公後私」的精神。譬如公務人員忠動職守，絕不利用職權營私作弊。經營稅收人員，對於捐稅款項涓滴歸公。警察爲治安服務，不藉職務向人民索詐。人民對於納稅義務，忠實履行。朝野中外人士，共同有「先公」的精神，於是一切市政咸上軌道。所以，能夠「先公」，然後「後私」，就不成問題。</p>
<p>可是，在目前的社會環境中，全體市民中能有一先公後私」的精神者，事實上誠是風毛麟角。所以上海市政府問題，至於今日仍無軌道可循，甚且危機四伏，隱憂方興，市民缺乏先公後私精神，實爲主因。退一步說，不能先後私，至少「先私後公」，因爲限私後公者，至少「綫私後公」，因則絕對不可。戰時與乎時，處境絕不相同，戰時是與敵人暗爭國運，戰爭而勝，國家生存，戰爭而敗，國家滅亡。所以，戰時應以爭取國家生存為第一義，在爭取勝利的要求下，個人一切均可犧牲，惟有公家利益不可稍損。目前是大東亞戰爭決戰階段，正與敵人搏鬥中如欲保證爭取國家生存，必須放棄先私後公，必須實錢先公後私。</p>
<p>更就上海市民一般風氣觀察，質直的設，「先公後私」精神，上面已經說過。鳳毛鱗角，卽能「先私後公」者，亦屬不多，而最普遍者，就是「只私無公」。一般人只知私事私利，不願公事公利。醫如追求暴利主義者，不擇手段，不顧大衆，損人利己，惟圖四利。這是十足一只四無公」的代表。又如前幾天的黑市米價，在上海近郊食米入口表。因為只私無公的風氣滋蔓，致使國家社皮之不存，毛將焉附，私人何責乎財產，也必遭遇猶太人之命運而己。</p>
<p>在此戰時，「先私後公「已屬不可，而「只私無公」更為危險。我們為爭取國家生存，為建設新上海，必須消滅「只私無公」，糾正風氣。在積極方面，推動社會公益事業，如警察消費合作社，遊民勞動服務營，教職員生活補助，這是有開治安，生活，教育的市政問題。消極方面，提倡節約，减少私人享受慾望。</p>
<p>先公後私？先私後公？只私無公？孰去孰取？願上海市民同人，共同覺悟眞決選擇之這？</p>

<h3>艱難因苦舊門精神　悉在日軍隊中養成　蔣介石對從軍學生訓誥</h3>
<p>廣東五日中央社電　據重慶大公報載稱，蔣介石前此對第一次教導團第一團，約四千名從軍學生之訓話中，會語及三十餘年前，渠於日本高田聯隊，充當見習士官時，身受之堅苦生活，茲誌其大意如次：本人於高田部隊之軍隊生活，其艱苦具非我國靑年所能想像者。日本新兵入營期，大抵為孟冬，高田部隊又係於日本北部最寒冷多雪之新瀉縣內，但不論天氣如何寒冷，我等每日必須於晨五時起床，親至井台汲水。洗漱完畢后，又須將馬產出餐。日本軍隊伙食，無論餐。日本軍隊伙食，無論飯菜均有定飮，非如現在爾等可以隨意增减。蔬菜僅為魚鹹菜等淸淡食品，每星期食肉〇次，內中雖亦有多數貴族富家子弟，但均一律看待。本人於入營前半月間，因不習慣，每次就食，只好甘忍挨餓。待至晚間，始能到營內販賣店購買點心充饑。點心並不許可多買，每人只浪制兩三塊，且時間稍遲，即不易購。但為充饑，亦只好忍耐。直至兩星期後，伙食始漸習慣。此外，新兵又須為舊兵洗衣擦皮鞋，有時甚至為老兵縫補衣服。於此期間，實為本八畢生中最値得懷念之勞作時期。本人不畏艱難困苦之奮鬥精神，實皆係於此期中養成者。</p>

<h3>義大利戰綫的展望　歐洲決戰的序幕</h3>
<p>自五月十二日晨敵軍亞歷山大部下第五及第八軍向卡西諾，伽愛特灣的德防綫開始總以擊以來，南部義大利戰綫重見活躍。三月十五日起以數倍勢力拚命攻略卡西諾而失敗的英美軍，究以何種勝算計劃再度攻擊呢？戰幕方才揭開，自不容過早先下判斷。茲歸納到現在為止的狀况及今後的預測如次：</p>
<p>全綫激戰</p>
<p>此次攻勢以激烈的砲擊與空炸為序曲，織出動大批裝甲車，展開立體攻勢，其攻防之熾烈，為義大利戲綫展開以來所僅見。</p>
<p>目前的主要戰塲在山岳地帶的南方山岳一帶，即明吐諾，卡司推爾福特，桑安社萊阿等區域，及以卡西諾為中心的南部及北部地區。十二日，美軍在明吐諾攻擊西方海岸方面的德防綫，以防備鞏固米逞，乃攻略北方瑪利阿。印法恩德山，數小時候即遭反攻，未見何種變化。十三日，若干巡洋艦。　逐耀從海上攻擊威脅明吐諾背後的德補給綫，亦遭反攻。在卡司推爾福特，戰鬥相當激烈，北方的發伊特山，會數次展開白刃戰，結果如何尙未明瞭，但左右該山的麥伊奧山，則在德軍手中。至其北方，即卡西諾附近地點從桑安杜萊方面的利里溪谷，對列陳於該溪谷之西的德軍，開始猛攻，在溪流彼方確保橋頭堡，試欲向密那泰洛方面進出。</p>
<p>另一方面，從卡西諾南方九公里的桑安齊洛開始攻勢的英軍，與守備該地的胡降落傘部隊激戰，第一日以後，英軍勢力漸見衰弱。</p>
<p>又集結於西部地區烏隆基南方山麓地帶的英美第五軍，全綫約有四師至五師兵力，反之，在東部地區，即配置於卡西諾南方利里溪谷至平原地帶的英第八軍，約三師有獨立的織車旅團之兵力。推進至前綫。</p>
<p>英美空軍亦跟着陸上攻勢而盲炸義關全境。十四日最以來，往來羅馬上空的敵機大見增加。</p>
<p>英美轉變作戰方針</p>
<p>敵攻勢的目標，在開拓「向羅馬的通路」。前在卡西諾失敗的敵人，放棄集中攻勢於一點的方策，試從全綫的某一地點侵人，另求發展。但這種方法自然需要很大的兵力與時間，且在德軍的防綫前，殆為不可能者。</p>
<p>於是德義軍首腦部均一致以為英美軍或將在全綫展開攻勢，以眩惑並牽制德軍，而開始從納吐諾的攻勢，或將在齊列尼亞海及阿德里亞海尋求新的登陸點。</p>
<p>但一向不見敵人動靜的阿德里亞海北方，最近敵軍對該地匪賊的呼應，則頗須警戒。當此歐洲第二戰綫甚囂　上的時候，這戰綫的重開實有極深刻的意織。</p>
<p>第二戰綫的關聯性</p>
<p>邇二三個月來，第二戰綫不實行與必將實行的爾說，成為一般人相，第二戰綫除非在五的話頭。任何人都這樣月內開始，否則是不可能的。那麼，現在南部戰綫開始活動，究竟是對第二戰綫的一種牽制要塞的英美，想用攻略義大利半島來敷衍了事，或者是未來的第二戰綫之序幕，尋求從此地向法國南部攻擊及向巴爾幹展開的立脚點，而爲戰略之一端。這些都是耐人尋思而堪予注目的問題·（翔：譯自五月十七時期日讀賣報知）</p>

<h3>渝十二中全會　召開之內幕</h3>
<p>中央社訊　渝政權為綫和英美之不滿及避免其他政黨之次擊，乃召開十二中全會，決議改革檢查制度及實施憲政方案，表面上似為維護民主國家之地位，以圖消除各方之懷疑，其實仍一本過去之獨裁政策。頃擄可靠方面消息，對渝政權之欲蓋彌彩，及其內都恐慌狼狽之情形，暴露無遺，茲分誌如次：</p>
<p>緩和空氣　關於渝政權於上月杪所舉行之十二中全會之決議　改革檢察報章雜誌制度，　憲政實施方案，此爾問題，前者之決議　殊令人呌奇，查渝政權以民主國家為幌子，平素渝政權之態度懷疑更甚。其次爲憲政實施問題，去年九月在十一中全會時，各方議論分歧，尤以共黨責雜為甚，渝蔣被迫聲明於戰爭結束後之一年內，召開國民代表大會，以圖緩和空氣，但觀諸渝政權以往之事實，如民二十六之六中全會及二十九年十一月十二日等之國民大會之決定，事實上根本未予實行，是爲公黨之首次不滿，目對渝政權如實行憲政時，應覆行之三項條件　保障人民民主自由，　開放黨禁，　實行地方自治，該項主張，不但渝內部有表同情者，即英美亦深以為然，是以淪政權大為恐懼，為防止失去民衆之信仰，於今特提出實施憲政，以期待明年底召集國民大會，決議後實行之，斷緩和各方空氣而巳。</p>
<p>狼狽異常　查過去渝政權召開中央執行委員會議時，事前必先舉行國民參政，方為合法，詎該次之十二中全會，事先旣米有參政會之舉行，竟斷然單獨召開十而中全會，此足證渝政權之未放棄獨裁。一面佯作應付當前時局，而以改革檢查制度及宣行憲政之方案朦蔽之，又在此十二中全會舉行後，復召開所謂行政會議，各該省「省長」均應召赴淪參加，討論所謂建設各省效率之增進。當獲悉日軍攻繫洞庭湖渝「第六戰區」時，諸「省長」莫不焦急異常，紛紛震歸所屬防地，其狼狽原因，不外因次日軍進攻河甫，一舉攻佔洛陽。彼業對日軍之出奇制勝，殊出意料之外，且今後對日軍之動向，又未能明測，於如渝胡宗南軍與蔣鼎文軍之感情不睦，當部嚴重磨擦下，又可見渝方此次行政會議之中止舉恐行慌耳足證淪方本身實異常恐慌耳。</p>
<p>物價暴漲　此外如渝方之通貨膨脹，物價暴漲，人民生活痛苦不堪，怨恨　道。查復物騰貴原因，不外　通貨膨脹，　物資缺乏，　投機活動所造成，故渝方法幣之膨脹，即信用破產之明說，且渝方法幣之數額猛增，無異財政虧損，致造成投機活躍。一面在增加通貨時，物資乃益為缺乏，如今渝通貨之發行額究竟多少，自民國二十九年九月以來，迄未發表，蓋在當年六月底，發行額為三十九萬萬六千萬元，往後即濫行發行，數目頗巨，而渝之經濟家會予佔計，近年內發行達一千萬萬元之多，均由美國製造，從印度北方輪運赴渝。去年九月二十七日，大公報曾於披露，美從印飛渝之飛機，所載物資中，渝法幣佔百分之四十，同時並指賣當今問題需耍者乃為軍需品及軍火，如長此輸送法幣，今後渝財政有崩潰之虞，但渝方置若罔聞。同時黃埔系軍人及地方民間資本家亦戰如攻擊，關於渝物價暴貴，指數預算頗難。前有渝名經濟家予以測定，爲民國二十六年上半年度之指數，假定爲一百分，在民國三十一年底即爲七千分，本年一月中為三萬分，今已四萬五千分，由此以觀，渝方物價指數已超國通貨數倍以上，是爲渝方面惡性之通貨膨脹矣。</p>
<h3>德方正是宣布　退出羅馬城　抗戰決心仍堅不動搖</h3>
<p>柏林五日中央社急電　海通社訊：德軍司令部已宣布德軍退出羅馬。</p>
<p>柏林五日中央社電　海通社訊：德軍為免羅馬這戰事之茶毒，業已退出羅馬。德最高統帥公殺稱：「因戰塲已愈益迫近羅馬，此世界最古文化中心有問接被牽人戰爭之危檢，為避免此項危險起見，元首已令德軍退至該城之西北。義境戰事仍將以不搖動之決心繼續進行，以達到最后擊破敵人之功擊，而與即盟國共同獲得勝利，其先決條件為與義國及其他盟國密切合作。侵歐之年，將為敵人遭遇慘敗之時。」</p>
<p>米蘭五日中央社電德國社訊：反軸心軍佔領羅馬後，義法西斯共和致府本日宣佈義境內之一切娛樂場所皆將停閉，在該時期中所有運動競技亦皆取消。</p>
<p>德軍後衛戰成功　柏林五日中央社電　海通社訊：希特戰為不欲羅馬古城受戰爭之蹂躪起見，已令德軍退出羅馬，德軍絕司令部，固始終未有死守羅馬之意，德後衛部隊在過去數日中，在城南阻止敵軍迅速進進，使主力部隊得以撤至更有利之新陳地，而敵方之包圍計劃逐全部失敗。今後羅馬一百四十萬居民之糧食，當由敵方設法供給，此固非輕而易舉之事也。自東及東南向羅馬推進之反軸心軍，在阿爾巴山麓及岡巴格那受創頗重。德軍一小隊堅守卡伏山，直至彈藥用聲為止，始行引退。敵方之法軍坦克車隊在薩加羅洛——巴萊斯特里那——卡夫區被創至重。第勒尼安海岸德軍撤至蒂柏河下游，幾未受敵軍之阻撓。</p>
<p>羅馬不設防建議　瑞典京城五日中央社電海通社訊，倫敦訊：英報謂反軸心軍克望接受凱塞林元帥之建議，承認羅馬為不設防城市。英報暗示反軸心軍將充分利用羅馬使成為交通中心。</p>
<p>義遵守盟約不渝　米蘭五日中央社電海通社訊：羅馬廣播報告透露，縱然羅馬失陷，義大利法西斯共和國仍決心繼續抗戰。</p>
<p>羅邱江報告戰局　里斯本五日中央社宣布羅斯福總統對於德軍撤離羅馬一事，將向美全國演講。</p>
<p>瑞典京城五日中央社電　海通社訊。倫敦消息：唐甯街方面探悉，英首相邱士。爾將於本週內向下議院報告戰局。</p>
<p>英民衆不感與舊　瑞典京城五日中央社電　海通社訊：路透社訪員稱，英報雖以大標題刊載羅馬即將陷落之消息，然並未足以充分激發人民勝利之熱忱，黨人早義境戰事進展過，今後即使有何發展，亦難以產生重大反響。目前能使英人感覺興趣之消息，惟進攻西歐一事而已，然而大部份之英國羣衆業於此項工作之艱鉅，均以為極感困難，且自德黑蘭會議後，英人情緒一時頗見緊張，然以久無動靜，神經亦不免已鬆弛，因而覺前此之猜測與期望未免錯誤。</p>
<h3>保國新內閣成立後　加強對德協力體制　對蘇關係趨緊張</h3>
<p>里斯本五日中央社電　歐洲戰局除激烈之羅馬攻防戰外，最値得注意者，常推以保加利亞為中心之德蘇兩國外交戰。蓋目南美厄瓜多革命勃發新政權成立後，美國於南美勢力遂有轉弱之傾向已愈顯著，同時背後之蘇聯勢力漸已抬頭，極堪注目，保加利亞隨東部戰綫之移動，一方與德國結成三國同盟，而對蘇聯則向保持徽妙之中立國立塲。即巴爾幹情勢緊泊後，德國會極力要求保國與德加强協力體制，而保加利亞於國內緒成人民戰綫，於國外則向英美兩國發出脫離保加利亞戰綫之勸告。一方蘇聯則於保加利亞增設領事館，並提出其他各項耍求，而此種要求又適與德之同盟關係爾相抵觸。於是進退兩難之巴伊洛夫內閣終因政局不安，不得不行總辭。至五月三十一日前農長巴格亞諸夫之新閣成立，政局始較為安定，同時由新內閣之性格判斷之，可知今後保加利亞之對德協力體制更將加强，同時對蘇關係之緊張恐亦終難避免。</p>
<h3>東線沉寂　德工作隊長陣亡</h3>
<p>柏林五日中央社電　海通社訊負賣方面息：東綫戰事昨稍形沉寂，雅賽以北及西北之山頭，仍在德軍之手，羅軍步兵第十一師厥功甚偉。柏林五日中央社電東部戰綫之社特工作隊隊長布盡庫滿敎授，於四日戰死，該教授為戰時生產部長施別爾之協力者，一九四〇年會任空軍擴張計劃建築部監督，東亞地方建築部長，一九四二年以來，根任東部發綫杜特工作隊長。</p>
<h3>防禦西歐　德準備周密</h3>
<p>沮里希五日中央社電　英每日郵報馬德里時派員曾報稱，德國倫台特元帥會指令西歐德軍「準備戰鬥」，各飛機塲·要塞。戰車基地之士卒，徹夜實行監視工作。又瑞典報柏林特派員訊，德外交部表示見解如下：反軸心軍之侵入作戰延期，與美國大總統之選舉頗有關聯，羅斯福不顧依艾森雷華計劃之成敗，而決定其政治出路，此種國內政治理由，業使羅斯福不得不取消與斯達林譏長之約會。關此，眞理報復刊載如次：義大利戰綫業使反軸心軍之西歐侵入作戰時期繼續遲延，然常局方面却進會侵入作戰廷期迄至何日為止。德軍當局承認反軸心之宣傳與煽動殊屬巧妙，然不問時期如何，德軍之防衛準備並無變化。</p>
<h3>瑞典武裝　維護中立</h3>
<p>瑞典京城五日中央社電　海通社訊：瑞典軍總司令容格將軍，於馬爾漠營房成立時演說謂，瑞典隨時有以戰爭姿態之行動，保衛中立之可能，吾但仍雖有有被保迫守而中武立決心，坑內，故吾人當利用每一機會從事備戰。</p>
<h3>日本海軍的成生活</h3>
<p>直此總力戰色彩，愈形深刻化之秋，日本海軍於優秀裝備與光輝傅統轄，其訓練之猛烈，誠無可比擬，百經磨練的這種海軍精神，爲此參加佐加保鎭守指導的海軍軍事講習會凡三天，目睹海軍精說的搖籃地某海兵圑的　成生活，接觸了報緊英美的決意愈益固的決戰日海軍眞姿，報告於次：</p>
<p>練皆期間中宿泊練習艦某號，此艦為前次歐洲大戰時的新銳驅逐艦，會衝破萬力破浪，建立勳功，最初的號令是：「德員起牀的五分開前」這是一日總洗員的起牀」的命令以下，一，然後上了板整隊排列</p>
<p>六點，由當值敎官的引牽，參觀朝裡，黎潮濕的小丘上，瀰浸着樹木流露出來的翠綠精氣，不央緊高張台起為來中練，白一色的男子，作着整然的隊伍，成為很大的集圑。朝輝如儀，遙拜宮城，默禱奉唱明治天皇御歌，完畢一部份</p>
<p>即從事淸掃工作。其餘開始海軍體操，參觀朝禮之後返到艦內，以小臉盆的水刷牙洗臉。</p>
<p>七點半鐘，準備早餐，由班長的號令吃飯，吃的東西雖然樸素，但有充分的榮養。</p>
<p>衛兵隊準備</p>
<p>八點，掦起軍艦旗及朝會，軍艦旗為軍艦的生命，揭豎軍艦旗十分前，有「衛兵隊準備」的號令，對於最虔誠的實施檢點服裝及動作，術兵司令即引率衛兵驟，而對後方甲板旗杆，整備隊伍，全員侍立。準時由當値將校下令之中，並在吹在奏嘹亮的國歌聲中，豎起崇嚴的軍艦旗，繼而實施朝禮</p>
<p>九點一刻，由敎官的指導，實施短艇的訓練，短艇為軍艦的一部份。離開了軍艦一尺，在光耀的軍艦旗招議下，便要決意在洋上孤立，短艇的訓練，乃表現不屈不撓的海軍傳統精神，分乘十二丁權，九尺小艇兩艘，各艘搭有指揮，艇長及十二名的撥船手。小艇離開母艦，短艇便上了碧波跳躍的海原去。</p>
<p>十一點三刻，用午膳。</p>
<p>午後一點一刻，在酒肆樓上聽敎頭市川上校的講話，市川上校曾任兵學校教官，教授統帥學，以統帥之本義為「着限，判斷，決心，處置之高邁，此本質非有正確的見透不可。」並說：「山本元帥為統帥者優秀，其見解實在正確。」警戒後來者不能鬢懈，最後强調皇國不敗的信念。繼即由海兵團長伊澤上校以下各雄佐官，教官等開座談會，海軍的訓練早就不分星期日或星期六，沒有一天的休息。指導官對於新兵教育的態度，表示崇高的熱情，那是如父母親對兒子一般的，强烈而不能形容的愛的感情。</p>
<p>午後四點三刻發，用晚飯。</p>
<p>午後五點二十九分鐘，降下軍艦旗。　　午後六點半鐘，洗澡，艦內的洗澡極其爽快，但很短促，因為顧慮着後來的人，浴槍內絕對不能使用毛巾，所以熟水至全部洗完仍很澄淸。表示了海軍的教義。午後七點鐘，結索訓練，這是海軍生活重要訓練之一，海軍使用有鋼索與麻索兩種，為着防止危險，由一切的角度有科學的分析，其，</p>
<p>短艇訓練</p>
<p>午後七點二十分鐘，在白畫的短艇訓練，得到自信的一行，勇躍出了黑暗的海上去。衝破海波疾駛的短艇，有夜光虫的明滅，空中佈滿着星光，心胸舒適得連手掌的痛都完全忘却了。</p>
<p>午後八點，放下吊牀，吊牀在戰鬥中，可被利用遙開子彈，這是護也知道的。不但如此，若把吊牀緊緊紮住，抱着在海中可以浮上海面二十四小時之久。軍艦搖動，吊牀並不怎樣搖動，可說最舒適的牀。吊牀的裝備及收拾工作，務須確實，迅速，靜肅三者並顧。於是下了「巡檢之五分前」的命令，一天的訓練便告結束。</p>
<p>午後九點鐘，即巡檢的時間，當値士官負着軍艦保安上的全責。巡檢士官對每一個經過猛訓練的兵士都投射着慈愛的眼光，把握着海眾精神的健康兵士的呼吸，在靜夜的艦內，隱約可開。</p>
<p>由上而的體騐，深覺一般所謂的「隘路」·而視為不可能的事情·在海軍即以澈底的決戰方策斷然加以打破，收到更大的成果。</p>
<p>講習告終之後，記者參觀了海軍某航空隊，該航空隊的靑年鬥士悠然稱道：「倘使敵機突破我制空陣，侵犯我上空來，無論我方是練習飛機，一定五十架要抵住敵機五十架，一百架可對付敵機一百架。把敵機擊落。」經過猛訓練的日本海軍所達到的死生觀，眞是崇高可敬。（戶島記者）（弘譯自朝日新）</p>

<h3>市政諮詢委員會　昨招待陳市長　陳市長發表「米的問題」意見</h3>
<p>本市市政諮詢委員會於昨（五）日午後四時假工商聯誼會會議廳，舉行茶會，招待陳市長吳秘書長曁市府所屬各局局長熊劍東等，曁市商會，市民福利協會，國民外交促進會，工商聯誼會，新聞聯合會五團體理監事及會員一百餘人，由市政諮詢會常務委員李思浩陳日平林康侯項康原等殷勤招待，情況備極熟烈。茲分誌詳情如次：</p>
<p>李思浩詞</p>
<p>首由市政諮詢常委主席李思浩氏致詞稱：「在日前時局環境中，無論就中國以至大東亞範圍而言，上海所處之地位，極爲重要，所以上海的一切問題，都須得到合理的解決。從另一方面觀察，上海需要解決的問題很多，就大者而官，例如治安民生生產財政敎育等等，這些問題的解決，一定要官民共同協力，才能得到順利的成效。我們相信陳市長以次各長官，對於上海一切問題的解決，有理想的宏願，有遠大的抱負。最近設價市政諮詢委員會，足見當局虛心求治之處，諮詢委員會雖非正式民意機關，但我們在市民立場，表示非常感舊。市政常局以及市民大衆對於市政進展，在平時巳經要共同努力，在此戰時更需共同努力，才能克服一切困難。市政諮詢委員會的宗皆，一方面備市政常局諮詢，一方面博採市民輿情，向市政當局建議。我們站在諮詢委員會立場，自應勉力做到所懸的宗旨。今天的茶會，對於陳市畏曁各長官表示敬意外，特地邀請上每各公團各界主要人士出席相緊，表示官民的大團結，共同爲解决上海一切問題而努力，完成建設新上海的目的。」詞畢並代馮炳南委員宣讀意見書，略謂：「　配給制度之實行，一定要做到權利義務同時並重，同時付諸實現，纔能成功。所謂權利就是配給物品由政府的採購機構單獨採購，只有採購機關纔有採購的權利，什麽呌做義務呢，所謂義務就是保證人民對於配給物品獲得最低的需要數量，同時使配給不脫期。其次人事問題也很重要，因爲辦事人員之誠實，廉潔，工作有效率，這也是使配給制度成功的一個必要條件。　中央政府或地方政府最重要的任務，是如何使行政費用的負担公平分配，使各階層的納稅人平均負担租稅的責任。　鄙人參加諮詢委會的工作，希望本會最低限度先解決：　食糧，　敎育，　醫藥三個問題，　廉潔，不但應用於政治，而且也應該用於各種職業，官吏人民面面　到，廉潔政治纔能實現，　官民應打成一片，其終極的目的，就是「福國利民」，如何能使官民打成一片呢？鄙人以爲袛有實行「誠意坦白」四字。</p>
<p>陳市長詞</p>
<p>末由陳市長超立致辭，略謂：「今天承蒙舉行盛大茶會歡迎，非常感謝。現在諸位最關心的是米的問題，今暫價於後，先來談一談這幾年來市政府所做的事情，市府同人對過去上海的市政，可謂「心有餘而力不足」，想在座各位，一定能諒解。自市政諮詢委員會成立後，覺得責任較輕，現在共聚一堂，有事可以共商，各位不使處於諮詢的地位，隨時提出各項建議，並且親自奔走接洽，本人一方面雖感覺輕鬆，但不覺將自己的責任交與各位分勞，殊覺不安。</p>
<p>此外談到米的問題，在上海無一問題，較此更爲嚴重。本人初來時巳覺嚴重，當民國二十一年本人在實業部時，巳感嚴重，檢閱過去發表之文章即見一斑。中國雖以農立國，但食糧不足，由來已久，硏究結果，洋米入口，始於遜淸同治六年，至今已有七八十年歷史。據民國二十五六年平均統訂，我國無論豐收與否，均有洋米輸入，且豐收之年入口更多，更請專家研究，五年中平均每年洋米進口約一千六百萬担，其中百分之八十銷於華南，百分之二十運至北方，上海佔一千六百萬担中之百分之三十，即二十五萬担，究其原因，或以　太平天國之亂，內地交通阻塞，不得不求給於外洋，於是遂向緬甸·西貢·等地購訂食米。　一般商人均貪便利，向外洋訂購食米，較內地便利，故洋米輸入增多。　湖南等地米質不一，且無洋米之用機器輾軋，較易收藏。中國米的問題不能解決的話，簡直不能立國，當時在京成立農業試騐所，聘請專家硏究改良稱，麥種，並在崑山試騐一畝地可增產百分之十九，迨事變後即全功盡棄。民國廿九年來滬後，更知其嚴重，目前洋米又不能輸入。不久以前本人曾說過，上海米的問題不能解決，市長便一日不能做。</p>
<p>現在米的問題，巳至緊要關頭，本人每次赴京與各方連絡，希望改善統黔收買制度，同時商談農業增產計劃。關於購買是米統會的事，而統制市府不能做主。至於增會並非單是一個試騐所可以促成。於是本人常與各方談及如何加强農業試騐所，與各省市主管常局及各大學農業專科連絡，至少應恢復民國二十三年時代的情形，這好像太慢，決非一年收效，但「急治標」「慢治本」，若治本不談而徒求治標必不行，即本不改，標亦不能治，故應積極設法改良，能改良一縣，即改良一縣，逐漸椎廣，以達全面增產。如今米的問題我也知道，而且很關心。米的問題解決的話，上海的問題百分之八十可以解決。本人頃以市府立塲，將米的問題提出，希望各位加以注意，努力如何解決，則本人及市府全人極爲感謝。</p>
<h3>米商採辦食米請領護照踴躍　應徵米價格正核示中</h3>
<p>自本市當局通吿米糧搬入滬市護照之申請及頒發辦法，並在有關本辦法之各種手續未經辦妥及佈吿以前，由上海周圍搬入市內之米糧，不論數量多寡，均得自由運入，並不，採辦地點以蕪湖爲最，而松江，吳江，常州，常熱，無錫，楓涇，崑山，嘉與，嘉善等處次之，統計字數巳在十萬石以上，聞大批米糧正在途次，不日即可到滬，預料今後米價將更趨下跌。又關於應微米糧價格之議訂，聞米統會已草擬就緒，正呈謂行政院核示中。</p>
<p>糧局開公糶會議</p>
<p>本市食米奉令緩和限制後，市糧食局爲增裕民食起見，特於昨日午後四時在該局會議室內召集所屬各區公耀聯會辦事處負責人，舉行築議，飭令各該區米商迅速籌組食米採辦組，以便分別進行採購事宜，由該局秘書主任孫敦民主席，指示籌組機宜。</p>
<p>黑市米價日趨下跌</p>
<p>本市米糧問題，經當局採取必要措置，特准暫行自由搬運入口，無庸申請領取執照，幷不徽購，且數量亦不限制，因之來源暢旺，故人心鎭定，黑市米價日來步趨下跌，昨日市售巳入八關，米販呌賣街巷，乏人問津，嚴重之食米問題，巳漸見鬆懈，今後更可轉入佳境，市民可無庸杞憂矣。惟市民食米存量，以三個月爲限，逾限作囤積論。</p>
<p>運輸公司儘先運米</p>
<p>滬市擁有龐大人口，民食問題，向較各地嚴重，近頃米價又吿猛漲，影響民生至巨，陳兼建設部長有鑒于此，為緊要疏通來源起見，巳令飭華中鐵道公司，華中運輸公司，及中華輪船公司，上海內河輪船公司等水陸運輸機構，自即日起，凡米糧統制委員會通知各該公司，將米糧運滬時，各該公司應將其他貨運，概行暫緩，儘先運米，以濟民食，此學對于協助抑平米價，當有相當效果。</p>

<h3>「足食」第一</h3>
<p>— 黃曉舟</p>
<p>「國以民為本，民以食為天」。民食一日不能解決，民生一日不獲安定，影響國本，莫此為甚。邇來滬巿巿民以戶口米一再脫期，日常食糧不得不求諸黑市，而黑市米復以來源不暢，以致價格空前暴漲，殊引為隱憂。日前當局頒佑「京滬民食米臨時措置綱要」，緩和限制，圓滑供給，藉以抑平滬仰黑市米價。但往後之戶口米配給制度之是否能獲改進，實為市民日夜所望望者也。</p>
<p>按「京滬民食米臨時措置綱要」之頒施，原為和緩限制，以期均衡各地米價，消滅地域分配之不均。似此自由賣買之結果，若無特殊勢力從中作梗，自不失為良好之權宜措置。第以此項新措施，其當前功効所及，僅止于充裕來源，使黑市米價稍形低落而已，而市民仍須仰給于黑市者則如故。仰有進者，米糧搬運銷售旣自由矣，揆情度理，其售價當應與原產地之採辦成本，不致過殊；然而實際搬運途中之橫征苛索，或有難免，則轉嫁所及，仍非市民所能負担。至于奸商操縱圖利，富戶搜購貯臟等，是否能予絕對制止，實為最重要之問題。否則，雖自由運銷，來源通暢，而米價堅挺如故甚或反見踴躍，于細民何益？</p>
<p>當前之民食新措施，方在其實行之初，成就若何，固難逆料。惟仍令市民之食糧仰賴于黑市以補戶口米之不足，乃為不容掩飾之事實，且黑市價格又因種種人為原因漲跌不時，安定民生，猶屬空談。目今有望于政府當局者，無非切實改進採辦機構，健全配給制度，務期戶口之糧足資「糊口」，黑市消滅。誠然，扶擇手段，固應因時因地而制宜，而最終目的總求「足食」（戶口米之足食）。</p>
<p>雖然，揆度當局之用心，此次新措施之實行，不外　平衡各地米價——使不患「不均」，　提高產地米價，促進農民努力于米穀之生產——使不患「寡」。所以切盼當局于完成「均而不寡」之後，能有健全配給制度之樹立，能有足量戶口食米之配給，則小民幸甚，國家幸甚。</p>
<h3>給妹妹的信　（八）</h3>
<p>— 岩田豐雄著　洪洋譯</p>
<p>（呵，我想賽畫！）</p>
<p>在隆夫的心坎上，是想不到的渴想畫畫。在心板上浮現出，賽筆所感覺到的畫布彈力，以及調色板之類的畫具味道，是具有無限的誘惑力。</p>
<p>（如不畫那個，去畫什麽去呢？那樣美麗的東西！）</p>
<p>沒有帶來畫具箱，眞有點鐘胸頓足的後悔。</p>
<p>他對着艦影業巳消迤的海面，只有縱　無盡地，任情恣意地揮動着幻想的晝筆，在從事畫畫。沒有輪廓的畫，一頁一頁也出現於碧波之上。</p>
<p>當興奮稍微一鎭靜，他自己就驚訝起來。</p>
<p>（這究竟是怎麽一回事？打算投筆而來這個地方，目前不來又想畫畫，這究竟是怎麽一回事？）</p>
<p>他又聯想到，昨夜要給妹妹一封怎樣的信。是那樣討厭了的學畫，只在三十分鐘內，竟發生了這樣劇烈的，從未體騐過的劇烈的，熱烈要求畫畫，實使他驚訝不置。</p>
<p>不要急，我或許沒有必要丟掉畫筆，而又願意畫畫了。不是看到了不能畫的美麼？）</p>
<p>他窮途末路的錢門，突然覺着開了，而豁然開朗。</p>
<p>無論怎樣瞧一棵蘋果都不感覺美的畫家，或許不是一位眞正的畫家。然而，這是什麼意思呢？單單畫軍艦的畫家，或許是幼稚而低級的畫家，是以兒童為對象的藝術家。但，這豈不是也好麼？縱或不能担當畫家之名，縱令不能進入藝術家之行列，只要畫自已所感覺美麗東西，就可以無愧於天。——</p>
<h3>衛生之重要與傳染病之預防</h3>
<p>— 顧南羣</p>
<p>今天是衛生運動的第五天，關於衛生的必要和衛生的常識，以前幾位先生都巳經說過了。南羣在上海辦理醫院，巳經二十七年是一個實際上服務社會衛生事業的人，所以想補充說幾句普遍的實際的話。</p>
<p>現在米價這樣高，百物的價銀這樣大，醫藥的價錢又這樣隨着物價上漲，中產人家，實在巳經生不起病了，薪水階級的人，平常生活，還不易維持，一生到病，眞是無法解决，但是病生起來，不問生得起生不起，總是要生的，那末，怎樣辦呢？惟有使他不要生病，平日講求衛生，硏討種種預防計劃，所以生活程度愈高，我們愈要富心身體，因為健康就是財富。</p>
<p>以上的話，是為個人或一家經濟上打算盤。論起事業來，論起國家民族來，那衛生更値得重視。一個人成年以後，替社會服務，講求衛生的，精力充沛，可以做到七八十歲，不講求衛生的精力萎頓，做到五十歲以上，精神便不濟了，要養老了。</p>
<p>這是依據一般沒有特殊病狀而說，要知道忽視衛生，短命而死的，不知凡幾。攷世界衛生學發達的國家，其人民壽命的統計，確是比衆不同，像新西蘭人民平均可活到六十七歲，像歐俄人民壽命平均祗四十六七歲，這並不是某種民族壽命特別長，或特別短實在因為講求衛生和不講求衛生的緣故。做父母的體格固宜健全，就是哺乳時代兒童時代，直到壯年中年老年各時代倘使都在適合衛生的條件下生活，他的壽例子自然長</p>
<p>趨起一般患　病以傳染病為多，講起傳染病的來源，當然是微生物的作祟，據細菌學專家研究所得，一個細菌，如果在適宜的環境裏，繼續生長二十四小時，可以繁殖到環繞地球三周那麼長的一排，可見細菌繁殖的厲害，這樣，細菌傳染之可怕，要不加以預防，危及人類健康，何堪設想。</p>
<p>人類因傳染病而致死的，實較其他原因為多，尤其是在中國的死亡率中，所佔部份簡直有三份之二，以我們南洋醫院內科病的紀錄來說，接連一百四十個病人之中，有一百十一個人是傳染病，足證傳染病之多，實在太可怕</p>
<p>攷傳染病雖從微生物而發生，有的為急性病，有的為慢性病，論到上海呢，為東亞一大都市，五方雜處，人民往來頻繁，任何細菌都得附着人和物而帶來。現在簡單的說幾種傳染病，在寒天有麻疹，百日咳，白喉，肺炎，天花，腦膜炎等，在春天有斑疹傷寒，回歸熱等，在熱天有胃腸傳染病，傷寒，痢疾，霍亂等，至於結核病，梅毒，淋病，傳染力亦相當强大，但不分季節，終年有的，傳染病的一部份，在小兒特別容易感受，所以為父母的更</p>
<p>至於預防方法，衛生學發達的國家，非常重視，因之，傳染病比較稀少，就是醫學校為敎材關係而去找一個傳染病人，做實習指示也不易找到。試看東西洋衛生發達的國民，天花傳染很少，所以麻面的並不慣見，反之，在我國則隨處可以見到，從這一點看來就可證明預防效力的偉大，我國人民對於傳染病的預防，大多忽略，近幾年來衛生當局積極播種牛痘注射預防疫苗，人民視為畏途，不肯樂意接受，不願受微細痛苦而得到生命的安全，這眞太不注意衛生了。從現在起，從今天起，南羣懇切的希望我們全市同胞，共同致力，推動重視日常一切的衛生運動，這樣方能使我們中華民國的人民和世界最健康的民族並駕齊驅。</p>

        <h1>1944 - n154</h1>
<h3>Editorial: The Awakening of the People of Shanghai: Public Before Private? Private Before Public? Only Private, No Public?</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Municipal Advisory Committee and various parks hosted Mayor Chen and other officials. During the meeting, Chairman Ji Sihao gave a speech, stating that the progress of Shanghai's municipal administration requires joint efforts in normal times, and even more so during wartime, in order to overcome all difficulties. We strongly agree with this view.</p>
<p>We have said before that all those who reside in Shanghai are citizens of Shanghai, and in a broad sense, this should include people from both the government and the public, both Chinese and foreign. If the resolution of all issues in Shanghai depends on the joint efforts of all Shanghai citizens, then people from both the government and the public, both Chinese and foreign, all have their due responsibilities and should strive to fulfill them. How should they fulfill their responsibilities? First and foremost, they should have a spirit of "public before private." For example, public officials should be loyal to their duties and never use their authority for personal gain or engage in corruption. Those in charge of tax collection should ensure that every drop of tax revenue goes to the public coffers. Police officers should serve the public order and not use their positions to extort from the people. The people should faithfully fulfill their tax obligations. If people from both the government and the public, both Chinese and foreign, share a spirit of "public first," then all municipal administration will be on the right track. Therefore, if one can put "public first," then putting "private after" will not be a problem.</p>
<p>However, in the current social environment, those among the entire citizenry who can truly embody the spirit of "public before private" are as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. Therefore, the problem of Shanghai's municipal administration remains without a proper path to follow, and is even fraught with crises and hidden worries. The main reason for this is the citizens' lack of a spirit of "public before private." Taking a step back, if one cannot put "public before private," then at least put "private before public," because to limit the "private after the public" then at least put "private before public" is absolutely impermissible. The circumstances of wartime are completely different from those of peacetime. In wartime, we are secretly competing with the enemy for the fate of the nation. If we win the war, the nation survives; if we lose, the nation perishes. Therefore, in wartime, the primary goal should be to strive for the survival of the nation. Under the demand for victory, everything personal can be sacrificed, but the public interest must not be harmed in the slightest. Currently, we are in the decisive stage of the Greater East Asia War, fighting with the enemy. If we want to guarantee the survival of the nation, we must abandon "private before public" and truly practice "public before private."</p>
<p>Looking at the general atmosphere of the people of Shanghai, frankly speaking, the spirit of "public before private," as mentioned above, is as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. Even those who can put "private before public" are not many, and the most common are those who are "only private, no public." Most people only care about their own affairs and interests and are unwilling to consider public affairs and interests. For example, those who pursue profiteering at all costs, disregarding the public and harming others to benefit themselves, are solely focused on personal gain. This is a perfect example of someone who is "only private, no public." Another example is the black market rice prices of the past few days, in the import forms of rice near Shanghai. Because the atmosphere of "only private, no public" is spreading, if the nation and society cease to exist, where can the individual attach himself? Private property will inevitably meet the fate of the Jews.</p>
<p>In this time of war, "private before public" is already impermissible, and "only private, no public" is even more dangerous. In order to strive for the survival of the nation and build a new Shanghai, we must eliminate "only private, no public" and correct the prevailing atmosphere. On the positive side, we should promote social welfare undertakings, such as police consumer cooperatives, labor service camps for vagrants, and living subsidies for teachers and staff. These address municipal issues related to public order, livelihood, and education. On the negative side, we should advocate thrift and reduce personal desires for enjoyment.</p>
<p>Public before private? Private before public? Only private, no public? Which to discard, which to choose? May all the people of Shanghai awaken together and truly decide which to choose?</p>

<h3>West Borneo Authorities Adapt to Wartime System</h3>
<p>Yangon, 5th (Central News Agency) – The authorities in West Borneo, in order to adapt to the wartime system, are making significant progress in all their work through the active efforts of military, government, and civilian personnel, with the assistance of the indigenous people. They are striving to overcome manpower shortages and transportation difficulties in shipbuilding, lumbering, mining, and forestry production and development, in order to enhance war capabilities, and have achieved great results. In terms of shipbuilding, despite difficulties in materials and labor, they were able to achieve the planned output of tens of thousands of tons last year. This year, they are also planning to build several tens of thousands of tons of naval-type sailing ships and tugboats, a fourfold increase over last year. With the cooperation of all parties, this goal should be easily achieved. Lumber production is three times higher than the previous year, and the development of various local mineral resources has reached the planned targets for Showa 18 (1943).

<h3>The Spirit of Hardship and Endurance is Cultivated in the Japanese Army: Chiang Kai-shek's Admonition to Military Students</h3>
<p>Guangdong, 5th (Central News Agency) – According to the Chongqing Dagongbao, Chiang Kai-shek, in his previous speech to the first regiment of the first training group, approximately 4,000 military students, mentioned the difficult life he experienced more than 30 years ago when he served as an apprentice officer in the Takada Regiment in Japan. The gist of his speech is as follows: The military life that I had in the Takada unit, its hardship it is not what our Chinese youths could imagine. Japanese new recruits usually enter the camp during the depths of winter, and the Takada unit was located in Niigata Prefecture, the coldest and snowiest part of northern Japan. However, no matter how cold the weather was, we had to get up at 5 a.m. every day and personally fetch water from the well. After washing up, we had to take care of the horses. The food in the Japanese army, whether it was rice or dishes, was fixed and could not be increased or decreased at will, unlike you who can now increase or decrease as you please. Vegetables were only bland foods such as salted fish and pickles, and meat was eaten only once a week. Although there were many nobles and wealthy children among us, everyone was treated the same. During the first half month after entering the camp, because I was not used to it, I could only endure hunger every time I ate. It was not until the evening that I could go to the store in the camp to buy snacks to fill my stomach. Snacks were not allowed to be bought in large quantities, only two or three pieces per person, and it was not easy to buy them if it was a little late. But in order to fill my stomach, I had to endure it. It was not until two weeks later that I gradually got used to the food. In addition, new recruits had to wash clothes and polish shoes for the old soldiers, and sometimes even sew clothes for the old soldiers. This period was actually the most memorable period of hard work in my life. The fighting spirit of not fearing difficulties and hardships was cultivated during this period.</p>
<h3>Central News Agency Convenes Cadre Meeting</h3>

Finally, in addition to emphasizing the inevitable victory of the Greater East Asia War and the importance of the ideological struggle to eliminate the oppression of East Asian nations by Britain and the United States, he pointed out that the Central News Agency of China and the Allied News Agency of Japan should work together to engage in this sacred ideological struggle in order to complete the Greater East Asia War and establish a new order in Greater East Asia. After Minister Anishi finished his speech, Minister Lin of the Propaganda Department gave a speech. Minister Lin first described the current situation and then gave three instructions on the future development of the Central News Agency's work: the selection of dispatches, the working principles of editing and interviewing, and how to make the connection between the head office and branch offices closer.

<h3>Prospects for the Italian Front: Prelude to the Decisive Battle in Europe</h3>
<p>Since the enemy's 5th and 8th Armies under General Alexander began their general attack on the German defense lines at Cassino and Gaeta Bay on the morning of May 12, the southern Italian front has become active again. Having failed in their desperate attempt to capture Cassino, which they attacked with many times their strength from March 15, what winning strategy are the British and American forces planning for their renewed attack? The curtain has only just been raised on the battle, so it is too early to make a judgment. The current situation and future predictions are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting on All Fronts</p>
<p>This offensive began with intense artillery and air bombardment, deploying large numbers of armored vehicles and launching a three-dimensional offensive. The intensity of the attack and defense is unprecedented since the start of the Italian theater.</p>
<p>The main battlefields are currently in the mountainous areas of the southern mountains, namely the areas around Minturno, Castelforte, San Elia, and the southern and northern areas centered on Cassino. On the 12th, the American forces attacked the German defense line on the western coast of Minturno, in order to prevent the consolidation of Mittum, and captured northern Maria. Mount Inde in France was counterattacked a few hours later, with no changes. On the 13th, several cruisers attacked and threatened the German supply line behind Minturno from the sea, but were also counterattacked. The fighting was quite fierce in Castelforte. On Mount Fait to the north, there were several bayonet fights, and the outcome is not yet clear, but Mount Maiola, which controls the mountain, is in the hands of the German army. To the north of that, in the area near Cassino, they launched a fierce attack from the Liri Valley on the San Andulese side against the German army stationed to the west of the valley. They secured a bridgehead on the other side of the stream and attempted to advance towards Minataello.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the British army, which launched an offensive from San Angelo, nine kilometers south of Cassino, engaged in fierce fighting with the Hu parachute units defending the area. After the first day, the strength of the British army gradually weakened.</p>
<p>In addition, the British and American Fifth Army, which is assembled in the foothills south of Ulronge in the western region, has a total strength of about four to five divisions. On the other hand, in the eastern region, the British Eighth Army, which is stationed from the Liri Valley south of Cassino to the plain, has a strength of about three divisions with independent armored brigades. Advance to the front.</p>
<p>The British and American air forces are also blindly bombing the entire Italian border following the ground offensive. The number of enemy planes coming and going over Rome has increased significantly since the 14th.</p>
<p>British and Americans Change Operational Policies</p>
<p>The goal of the enemy's offensive is to open up the "road to Rome." Having failed at Cassino, the enemy abandoned the tactic of concentrating their offensive on one point and tried to break through from somewhere along the entire line and seek further development. But this method naturally requires a great deal of manpower and time, and is virtually impossible in front of the German defense lines.</p>
<p>Therefore, the German and Italian military leaders all agreed that the British and American forces might launch an offensive along the entire line in order to confuse and restrain the German army, and begin an offensive from Natuno, or seek new landing points in the Tyrrhenian Sea and the Adriatic Sea.</p>
<p>However, the recent response of the enemy forces to the bandits in the northern Adriatic Sea, where the enemy has not been seen in action, requires considerable vigilance. At a time when the second front in Europe is making a lot of noise, the reopening of this front has a very profound meaning.</p>
<p>The Correlation of the Second Front</p>
<p>For the past two or three months, the question of whether the second front will be implemented or not has become a common topic of conversation. Everyone says that the second front is impossible unless it starts within May. So, is the current activity on the southern front a diversionary tactic or a prelude to the future second front, with the British and Americans trying to get away with capturing the Italian peninsula, or are they seeking a foothold from which to attack southern France and the Balkans, and as part of their strategy? These are all thought-provoking and noteworthy questions. (Sho: Translated from the May 17th issue of the Japanese Yomiuri Hochi)</p>

<h3>Regarding the Yudu 12th Plenary Session: Inside Story of its Convocation</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch: The Yudu regime, dissatisfied with the United States and Britain, and to avoid attacks from other political parties, convened the 12th Plenary Session, resolving to reform the censorship system and implement a constitutional program. On the surface, it seems to be maintaining the status of a democratic country in an attempt to dispel doubts from all parties, but in reality, it still adheres to its past dictatorial policies. Recently, reliable sources have revealed the Yudu regime's attempts to conceal the truth and its internal panic and embarrassment. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Easing the Atmosphere: Regarding the resolutions of the 12th Plenary Session held by the Yudu regime at the end of last month, the reform of the censorship system for newspapers and magazines, and the constitutional implementation program, the former resolution is particularly surprising. The Yudu regime uses democratic countries as a facade, and its usual attitude is even more suspicious. Secondly, regarding the issue of constitutional implementation, during the 11th Plenary Session last September, opinions differed greatly, especially with strong criticism from the Communist Party. Jiang of Yudu was forced to declare that a National Assembly would be convened within one year after the end of the war to ease the atmosphere. However, judging from the past facts of the Yudu regime, such as the decisions of the 6th Plenary Session in the 26th year of the Republic of China and the National Assembly on November 12th of the 29th year, they were never actually implemented. This was the first dissatisfaction of the Communist Party. Currently, the Communist Party has three conditions for the Yudu regime to fulfill when implementing constitutionalism: Guarantee the people's democratic freedom, lift the ban on political parties, and implement local autonomy. Not only are there those within the Yudu regime who express sympathy for these demands, but even the United States and Britain deeply agree. Therefore, the Yudu regime is greatly frightened. In order to prevent losing the faith of the people, they are now proposing to implement constitutionalism, hoping to convene the National Assembly at the end of next year and implement it after the decision, solely to ease the atmosphere from all parties.</p>
<p>Extreme Embarrassment: In the past, when the Yudu regime convened a meeting of the Central Executive Committee, it was necessary to first hold a National Political Council meeting to be considered legitimate. However, this time, the 12th Plenary Session was convened unilaterally without a prior National Political Council meeting, which proves that the Yudu regime has not abandoned its dictatorship. On the one hand, they pretend to cope with the current situation, and on the other hand, they conceal it with reforms to the censorship system and the proclamation of a constitutional program. After the 12th Plenary Session, they convened a so-called administrative meeting, and the "governors" of various provinces were summoned to participate in the Yudu, discussing the so-called improvement of efficiency in the construction of various provinces. When it was learned that the Japanese army was attacking the Dongting Lake Yudu "Sixth War Zone," all the "governors" were extremely anxious and rushed back to their respective defense areas. The reason for their embarrassment was none other than the Japanese army's attack on Henao the next day and their capture of Luoyang in one fell swoop. They were completely taken by surprise by the Japanese army's unexpected victory, and they could not clearly predict the future movements of the Japanese army. Furthermore, the discord between Hu Zongnan's army and Jiang Dingwen's army in Yudu, under the serious friction between the two, further shows that the suspension of this administrative meeting in Yudu was due to panic. This proves that the Yudu side itself is extremely panic-stricken.</p>
<p>Soaring Prices: In addition, in Yudu, inflation is rampant, prices are soaring, and people's lives are miserable, causing resentment everywhere. The reasons for the high cost of living are nothing more than inflation, shortage of materials, and speculation. Therefore, the inflation of Yudu's legal tender is a clear indication of the bankruptcy of credit. Moreover, the sharp increase in the amount of Yudu's legal tender is tantamount to financial losses, leading to active speculation. While increasing the currency supply, materials become even more scarce. As of now, the amount of Yudu's currency in circulation has not been announced since September of the 29th year of the Republic of China. It is estimated that by the end of June of that year, the amount in circulation was 39.6 billion yuan, and since then, it has been issued recklessly in large quantities. Yudu's economists have estimated that the amount issued in recent years has reached more than 10 trillion yuan, all manufactured in the United States and transported by air from northern India to Yudu. On September 27th of last year, Ta Kung Pao revealed that Yudu's legal tender accounted for 40% of the materials carried by American planes flying from India to Yudu. At the same time, it pointed out that what is needed most now are military supplies and ammunition. If legal tender continues to be transported in this way, Yudu's finances may collapse in the future, but the Yudu side turns a deaf ear. At the same time, Huangpu military personnel and local private capitalists are also launching attacks. Regarding the exorbitant prices in Yudu, it is quite difficult to estimate the index. A famous economist in Yudu estimated that if the index for the first half of the 26th year of the Republic of China was assumed to be 100 points, it would be 7,000 points at the end of the 31st year of the Republic of China, 30,000 points in January of this year, and now it is 45,000 points. From this, it can be seen that the price index in Yudu has exceeded the amount of currency in circulation by several times, which is a vicious inflation in Yudu.</p>
<h3>Germany Officially Announces Withdrawal from Rome; Determination to Resist Remains Unshaken</h3>
<p>Central News Agency rapid dispatch from Berlin, 5th: Huitong News Agency dispatch: The German High Command has announced the withdrawal of German troops from Rome.</p>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Berlin, 5th: Huitong News Agency dispatch: To avoid the poison of war in Rome, German troops have withdrawn from Rome. The German Supreme Commander publicly stated: "Because the battlefield is increasingly approaching Rome, this oldest cultural center in the world is in danger of being indirectly involved in the war. To avoid this danger, the Führer has ordered German troops to retreat to the northwest of the city. The war in Italy will continue with unwavering determination to achieve the final defeat of the enemy, and to jointly achieve victory with the Allied nations. The prerequisite is close cooperation with Italy and other allied countries. The year of invasion of Europe will be the time when the enemy encounters a disastrous defeat."</p>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Milan, 5th: German News Agency dispatch: After the anti-Axis forces occupied Rome, the Italian Fascist Republic announced today that all entertainment venues in Italy will be closed, and all sports competitions will also be canceled during this period.</p>
<p>Successful German Rearguard Action: Central News Agency dispatch from Berlin, 5th: Huitong News Agency dispatch: Hitler, in order to prevent the ancient city of Rome from being ravaged by war, has ordered German troops to withdraw from Rome. The German High Command has never intended to defend Rome to the death. In the past few days, the German rearguard units have prevented the enemy from advancing rapidly in the south of the city, allowing the main forces to withdraw to more advantageous new positions, and the enemy's encirclement plan has completely failed. In the future, the food for the 1.4 million residents of Rome will be provided by the enemy, which is not an easy task. The anti-Axis forces advancing towards Rome from the east and southeast have suffered heavy losses in the Alban Hills and the Campagna. A small German unit held Mount Cavour until its ammunition was exhausted before withdrawing. The enemy's French tank columns suffered heavy losses in the Zagarolo-Palestrina-Cave area. On the Tyrrhenian coast, German troops withdrew to the lower reaches of the Tiber River, with almost no hindrance from the enemy.</p>
<p>Proposal to Demilitarize Rome: Central News Agency dispatch from Stockholm, 5th: Huitong News Agency dispatch, London dispatch: British newspapers said that the anti-Axis forces are expected to accept Marshal Kesselring's proposal to recognize Rome as a demilitarized city. British newspapers hinted that the anti-Axis forces will make full use of Rome as a transportation hub.</p>
<p>Italy Upholds Alliance Unwaveringly: Central News Agency dispatch from Milan, 5th: Huitong News Agency dispatch: Rome radio reports revealed that even if Rome falls, the Italian Fascist Republic is determined to continue the war.</p>
<p>Luo Qiu Jiang Reports on the War Situation: Central News Agency dispatch from Lisbon, 5th: President Roosevelt will address the nation on the German withdrawal from Rome.</p>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Stockholm, 5th: Huitong News Agency dispatch. London news: Downing Street has learned that British Prime Minister Churchill will report on the war situation to the House of Commons this week.</p>
<p>British Public Unmoved by Old News: Central News Agency dispatch from Stockholm, 5th: Huitong News Agency dispatch: Reuters reporters said that although British newspapers published the news of Rome's imminent fall under large headlines, it was not enough to fully stimulate the people's enthusiasm for victory. People have long anticipated the progress of the war in Italy, and even if there are any developments in the future, it will be difficult to generate a major reaction. Currently, the only news that can interest the British people is the invasion of Western Europe. However, most of the British public are aware of the arduousness of this task and believe that it is extremely difficult. Moreover, after the Tehran Conference, the emotions of the British people were quite tense for a while, but since there has been no movement for a long time, their nerves have inevitably relaxed, and they feel that their previous speculations and expectations were somewhat wrong.</p>
<h3>After the Establishment of Bulgaria's New Cabinet, Cooperation with Germany Strengthens; Relations with the Soviet Union Become Tense</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Lisbon, 5th: In addition to the fierce battle for Rome in the European theater, the most noteworthy event is the diplomatic war between Germany and the Soviet Union, centered on Bulgaria. Since the outbreak of the revolution in Ecuador in South America and the establishment of a new regime, the weakening of the United States' influence in South America has become increasingly obvious. At the same time, the Soviet Union's influence behind the scenes has gradually risen, which is extremely noteworthy. Following the movement of the Eastern Front, Bulgaria formed a tripartite alliance with Germany on the one hand, and maintained a delicate neutral stance towards the Soviet Union on the other hand. After the situation in the Balkans became tense, Germany strongly demanded that Bulgaria strengthen its cooperation with Germany. Bulgaria formed a people's front at home, and issued appeals to Britain and the United States to withdraw from the Bulgarian front abroad. On the other hand, the Soviet Union increased the number of consulates in Bulgaria and made other demands, which contradicted the alliance relationship with Germany. As a result, the Baivlov cabinet, which was in a dilemma, had no choice but to resign en masse due to political instability. The new cabinet of former Minister of Agriculture Bagjanov was established on May 31, and the political situation has become more stable. At the same time, judging from the nature of the new cabinet, it can be seen that Bulgaria's cooperation with Germany will be strengthened in the future, and the tension in relations with the Soviet Union will inevitably be unavoidable.</p>
<h3>Eastern Front Quiet; German Labor Corps Leader Killed in Action</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Berlin, 5th: Huitong News Agency dispatch: According to reliable sources, the Eastern Front was slightly quiet yesterday. The mountains north and northwest of Yassi are still in the hands of the German army, and the 11th Romanian Infantry Division has made great contributions. Central News Agency dispatch from Berlin, 5th: Professor Buden Kuman, the leader of the Shete Labor Corps on the Eastern Front, was killed in action on the 4th. The professor was a collaborator of War Production Minister Speer. In 1940, he served as the supervisor of the construction department of the Air Force expansion plan and the Minister of Construction in East Asia. Since 1942, he has served as the leader of the Dutet Labor Corps on the Eastern Front.</p>
<h3>Meticulous German Preparations to Defend Western Europe</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Zurich, 5th: The Madrid correspondent of the British Daily Mail reported that German Marshal Lundstedt had instructed the German troops in Western Europe to "prepare for battle." Soldiers at various airfields, fortresses, and tank bases were carrying out surveillance work all night long. A special correspondent of the Swedish newspaper in Berlin reported that the German Foreign Ministry expressed the following views: The postponement of the anti-Axis invasion operation is closely related to the US presidential election. Roosevelt, regardless of the success or failure of the Eisenhower plan, decided his political future, and this domestic political reason has forced Roosevelt to cancel his meeting with Stalin. In this regard, the Pravda reprinted as follows: The Italian front has continued to delay the anti-Axis invasion operation in Western Europe, but the regular authorities have yet to determine how long the invasion operation will be postponed. The German authorities acknowledge that the anti-Axis propaganda and incitement are quite clever, but regardless of the timing, there is no change in the German defense preparations.</p>
<h3>Swedish Armed Forces Maintain Neutrality</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Stockholm, 5th: Huitong News Agency dispatch: General Younger, Commander-in-Chief of the Swedish Army, said at the establishment of the Malmö Barracks that Sweden has the possibility of defending its neutrality at any time with a war-like posture. "We still have the determination to be forced to maintain neutrality by force. Therefore, we must use every opportunity to engage in preparations for war."</p>
<h3>The Daily Life of the Japanese Navy</h3>
<p>Now that the colors of total war are becoming increasingly profound, the Japanese Navy, with its excellent equipment and glorious traditions, is undergoing training that is truly unparalleled. This Navy spirit, honed through countless trials, was the reason for attending the Navy Military Training Seminar held for three days under the guidance of Sasebo Naval Base. I witnessed the daily life of a naval recruit, the cradle of the Navy's elite, and came into contact with the unwavering determination to fight to the death against Britain and the United States. The true image of the Navy on the day of the decisive battle is reported as follows:</p>
<p>During the training period, we stayed on the training ship, a former state-of-the-art destroyer that had broken through countless waves and established meritorious service in the previous European War. The first order was: "Crew, five minutes before reveille!" This was the order for the entire crew to wake up for the day. Then, they boarded the deck and lined up in formation.</p>
<p>At 6:00 AM, led by the duty instructor, we observed the morning rituals. The lush green essence emanating from the trees permeated the damp hills of the dawn. The white-clad men stood tall and tense, forming an orderly and massive group for training. In accordance with the morning ceremonies, we reverently bowed towards the Imperial Palace, offered silent prayers, and chanted Emperor Meiji's imperial poem. After completing a part of the ceremony,</p>
<p>we immediately engaged in cleaning duties. The rest began naval exercises. After observing the morning rituals, we returned to the ship and brushed our teeth and washed our faces with water from small washbasins.</p>
<p>At 7:30 AM, we prepared breakfast. Following the squad leader's orders, we ate. The food was simple, but it provided sufficient nutrition.</p>
<p>Preparation of the Guard Detail</p>
<p>At 8:00 AM, we raised the naval ensign and held the morning assembly. The naval ensign is the life of the warship. "Preparation of the guard detail" was ordered ten minutes before raising the ensign. We meticulously inspected our uniforms and movements with the utmost reverence. The warrant officer led the guard detail to the stern deck flagstaff and prepared the formation. On time, under the order of the duty officer, and amidst the blaring sound of the national anthem, the solemn naval ensign was raised. Then, the morning assembly was carried out.</p>
<p>At 9:15 AM, under the guidance of the instructors, we conducted short boat training. The short boat is a part of the warship. Once it leaves the warship by one foot, under the beckoning of the glorious naval ensign, we must resolve to be isolated on the ocean. Short boat training expresses the indomitable spirit of the naval tradition. We boarded two nine-foot boats, each equipped with a commander, a coxswain, and twelve rowers. The short boats left the mother ship and went out onto the shimmering sea.</p>
<p>At 11:45 AM, we had lunch.</p>
<p>At 1:15 PM, we listened to a lecture by Chief Instructor Colonel Ichikawa in the officers' mess. Colonel Ichikawa had served as an instructor at the Naval Academy and taught the art of command. He defined the essence of command as "lofty insights, judgment, determination, and disposition." He stated, "Admiral Yamamoto was an excellent commander because his insights were truly accurate." He warned those who came later not to become complacent and finally emphasized the belief that the Imperial Land would never be defeated. Following this, Naval Academy Commandant Colonel Izawa and other officers and instructors held a panel discussion. The Navy's training had long ceased to distinguish between Sundays and Saturdays, with no days of rest. The instructors expressed a sublime passion for educating the new recruits, a feeling of love that was as strong and indescribable as that of parents for their sons.</p>
<p>At 4:45 PM, we had dinner.</p>
<p>At 5:29 PM, the naval ensign was lowered. At 6:30 PM, we took a bath. Bathing inside the ship was extremely refreshing, but very brief, because we were considerate of the people who came later. Towels could not be used in the bathtubs, so the bathwater remained clear even after everyone had finished bathing. This expressed the Navy's teachings. At 7:00 PM, we conducted rope training. This is one of the most important training exercises in naval life. The Navy uses both steel and hemp ropes. In order to prevent danger, there is a scientific analysis from every angle. That is,</p>
<p>Short Boat Training</p>
<p>At 7:20 PM, having gained confidence from the short boat training during the day, we bravely went out to sea in the darkness. The short boat rushed through the waves, with the flickering of noctiluca. The air was filled with starlight. The heart and mind felt so comfortable that even the pain in the palms of our hands was completely forgotten.</p>
<p>At 8:00 PM, we hung up our hammocks. Hammocks can be used to stop bullets in battle, as everyone knows. Not only that, but if the hammock is tied tightly and held in the sea, it can float on the surface of the sea for up to 24 hours. Even when the warship rocks, the hammock does not rock much, making it the most comfortable bed. The preparation and cleaning of the hammock must be done reliably, quickly, and quietly. Then, the order "Five minutes before inspection" was given, and the day's training came to an end.</p>
<p>At 9:00 PM, it was time for inspection. The duty officer was fully responsible for the security of the warship. The inspecting officer cast a loving eye on each soldier who had undergone rigorous training, grasping the breath of the healthy soldiers who embodied the naval spirit. Within the quiet warship at night, it could be faintly heard.</p>
<p>From the above experiences, I deeply felt that what is generally regarded as a "narrow path" and considered impossible, the Navy resolutely breaks through with a thorough decisive battle plan, achieving even greater results.</p>
<p>After the seminar ended, the reporter visited a certain naval air corps. The young fighters of the air corps boasted leisurely: "If the enemy planes break through our air defense array and invade our airspace, whether our planes are training planes or not, we will definitely use fifty planes to stop fifty enemy planes, and one hundred planes to deal with one hundred enemy planes. We will shoot down the enemy planes." The view of life and death achieved by the Japanese Navy through rigorous training is truly sublime and admirable.

<h3>Municipal Administration Consultative Committee Hosts Mayor Chen Yesterday; Mayor Chen Expresses Views on the "Rice Problem"</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 5th), the Municipal Administration Consultative Committee of this city held a tea party at 4:00 PM in the meeting hall of the Industrial and Commercial Association to host Mayor Chen, Secretary-General Wu, the heads of various bureaus under the Municipal Government, including Xiong Jiandong, and over a hundred directors, supervisors, and members from five groups: the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Citizens Welfare Association, the National Diplomacy Promotion Association, the Industrial and Commercial Association, and the News Federation. The event was warmly hosted by the standing committee members of the Municipal Administration Consultative Committee, including Li Sihao, Chen Riping, Lin Kanghou, and Xiang Kangyuan, creating a very warm atmosphere. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Speech by Li Sihao</p>
<p>First, Li Sihao, chairman of the Standing Committee of the Municipal Administration Consultative Committee, delivered a speech stating: "In the current environment, both within China and in the Greater East Asia region, Shanghai's position is extremely important. Therefore, all of Shanghai's problems must be rationally resolved. On the other hand, Shanghai needs to solve many problems. In broader terms, these include issues of public security, people's livelihood, production, finance, and education. The solution of these problems must rely on the joint efforts of officials and the people to achieve smooth results. We believe that Mayor Chen and other officials have ideal ambitions and far-reaching aspirations for solving all of Shanghai's problems. The recent establishment of the Municipal Administration Consultative Committee demonstrates the authorities' eagerness to seek governance advice. Although the Consultative Committee is not a formal public opinion body, we, standing from the perspective of the citizens, express our deep appreciation. The Municipal Government and the general public should work together for municipal progress in normal times, and even more so during wartime, to overcome all difficulties. The purpose of the Municipal Administration Consultative Committee is to provide consultation to the Municipal Government and to collect public opinion from the citizens to make suggestions to the Municipal Government. Standing in the position of the Consultative Committee, we should strive to achieve the objectives we have set. Today's tea party, in addition to expressing respect to Mayor Chen and other officials, specially invites major figures from various public organizations and sectors in Shanghai to attend, representing the great unity of officials and the people, working together to solve all of Shanghai's problems and complete the goal of building a new Shanghai." After the speech, he also read out a written opinion on behalf of Committee Member Feng Bingnan, which briefly stated: "The implementation of the rationing system must ensure that rights and obligations are given equal emphasis and implemented simultaneously for it to succeed. The so-called right is that the procurement of rationed goods is solely the responsibility of the government's purchasing agency; only the purchasing agency has the right to procure. What is called the obligation? The so-called obligation is to guarantee that the people obtain the minimum required quantity of rationed goods and that the rationing is not delayed. Secondly, personnel issues are also very important, because the honesty, integrity, and efficiency of the staff are also necessary conditions for the success of the rationing system. The most important task of the central government or local government is how to fairly distribute the burden of administrative expenses so that taxpayers at all levels bear the responsibility of taxes equally. I participate in the work of the Consultative Committee, hoping that the committee will first solve at least three problems: food, education, and medicine. Integrity should not only be applied to politics, but also to all kinds of occupations, and should be faced by officials and the people. Only then can a clean government be realized. Officials and the people should be united, and the ultimate goal is to 'benefit the country and the people.' How can officials and the people be united? I think only by practicing the four words 'sincerity and frankness.'"</p>
<p>Speech by Mayor Chen</p>
<p>Finally, Mayor Chen Chaoli delivered a speech, briefly saying: "I am very grateful for this grand tea party held to welcome me today. What everyone is most concerned about now is the rice problem. Let's put this aside for a moment and talk about what the Municipal Government has done in recent years. My colleagues in the Municipal Government can be said to have 'more than enough heart but not enough strength' regarding Shanghai's municipal administration in the past, and I hope everyone present can understand this. Since the establishment of the Municipal Administration Consultative Committee, I feel that the responsibility is lighter. Now that we are gathered together, we can discuss things together. Everyone is not only in a consultative position, but also puts forward various suggestions at any time and personally runs around to make contacts. On the one hand, I feel relaxed, but on the other hand, I feel uneasy about handing over my responsibilities to everyone to share the burden.</p>
<p>In addition, when it comes to the rice problem, no problem in Shanghai is more serious than this. When I first came, I already felt it was serious. When I was in the Ministry of Industry in the 21st year of the Republic of China, I already felt it was serious. You can see it in the articles I published in the past. Although China is a country based on agriculture, it has a long history of insufficient food supply. According to research, the import of foreign rice began in the sixth year of the Tongzhi reign of the late Qing Dynasty, and it has been 70 or 80 years since then. According to the average statistics of the 25th and 26th years of the Republic of China, whether there was a bumper harvest or not, foreign rice was imported into our country, and even more was imported in years of bumper harvest. Experts were asked to study it, and the average annual import of foreign rice was about 16 million dan in five years, of which 80% was sold in South China and 20% was transported to the north. Shanghai accounted for 30% of the 16 million dan, which is 250,000 dan. The reason for this is perhaps the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Rebellion, which blocked inland transportation, so we had to seek supply from overseas, and then we ordered rice from Myanmar, Saigon, and other places. In general, merchants are greedy for convenience and order rice from overseas, which is more convenient than from the mainland, so the import of foreign rice has increased. The quality of rice in Hunan and other places is uneven, and there are no machines for milling like those used for foreign rice, which makes it easier to store. If the rice problem in China cannot be solved, it is simply impossible to establish the country. At that time, an agricultural experiment station was established in Beijing, and experts were hired to study and improve wheat varieties. Experiments in Kunshan showed that the yield per mu could be increased by 19%, but after the Incident, all efforts were wasted. After coming to Shanghai in the 29th year of the Republic of China, I knew it was even more serious. Currently, foreign rice cannot be imported. Not long ago, I said that if the rice problem in Shanghai cannot be solved, I cannot be the mayor for a day.</p>
<p>Now the rice problem has reached a critical juncture. Every time I go to Beijing, I contact all parties, hoping to improve the system for buying rice, and at the same time discuss plans to increase agricultural production. The matter of purchasing is under the control of the Rice Association, and the Municipal Government cannot make decisions. As for increasing production, it cannot be achieved by a single experiment station. Therefore, I often talk to various parties about how to strengthen agricultural experiment stations and contact the competent authorities in various provinces and cities and agricultural colleges, at least to restore the situation in the 23rd year of the Republic of China. This seems too slow and will definitely not produce results in one year, but "urgent treatment addresses the symptoms, slow treatment addresses the root cause." If we only talk about treating the symptoms without addressing the root cause, it will not work. If the root cause is not changed, the symptoms cannot be treated either. Therefore, we should actively find ways to improve, improve one county, then improve one county, and gradually promote it to achieve comprehensive production increase. I also know about the rice problem now, and I am very concerned about it. If the rice problem is solved, 80% of Shanghai's problems can be solved. I have just raised the rice problem from the perspective of the Municipal Government, hoping that everyone will pay attention to it and work hard to solve it, and the whole people of the Municipal Government and I will be very grateful."</p>
<h3>Rice Merchants Eagerly Apply for Passports to Purchase Rice; Price of Requisitioned Rice Being Approved</h3>
<p>Since the authorities of this city announced the application and issuance procedures for passports for transporting rice into Shanghai, and before the various procedures related to these measures have been completed and announced, rice transported into the city from the surrounding areas of Shanghai, regardless of quantity, can be freely transported in without [taxation?]. Wuhu is the most popular procurement location, followed by Songjiang, Wujiang, Changzhou, Changshu, Wuxi, Fengjing, Kunshan, Jiaxing, Jiashan, and other places. The total number of characters has already exceeded 100,000 shi. It is reported that a large amount of rice is on its way and will arrive in Shanghai soon. It is expected that rice prices will continue to fall in the future. Regarding the discussion of the price of requisitioned rice, it is reported that the Rice Association has drafted it and is submitting it to the Executive Yuan for approval.</p>
<p>Grain Bureau Holds Public Rice Sale Meeting</p>
<p>After the restrictions on rice in this city were eased, the Municipal Grain Bureau, in order to increase the people's food supply, specially convened a meeting of the heads of the public rice sale liaison offices in various districts at the bureau's conference room yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM to discuss the matter, ordering rice merchants in each district to quickly form rice procurement groups to carry out procurement matters separately. The meeting was chaired by Sun Dunmin, secretary director of the bureau, who instructed on the organization of the group.</p>
<p>Black Market Rice Prices Continue to Fall</p>
<p>The rice problem in this city has been addressed by the authorities taking necessary measures, specifically allowing temporary free transport of rice into the city without the need to apply for a license or tax collection, and without limiting the quantity. As a result, the source is unblocked, so people's hearts are calm. Black market rice prices have been falling steadily in recent days. Yesterday, the selling price on the market had already fallen below eight yuan. Rice vendors were selling in the streets and alleys, but few people were interested. The serious rice problem has gradually eased, and it can be expected to turn into a better situation in the future, and the citizens need not worry unnecessarily. However, the amount of rice stored by citizens is limited to three months; exceeding the limit will be considered hoarding.</p>
<p>Transportation Company Prioritizes Rice Transportation</p>
<p>Shanghai has a large population, and the people's food problem is more serious than in other places. Recently, rice prices have risen sharply again, which has greatly affected people's livelihoods. Chen, the Minister of Construction, in view of this, in order to urgently dredge the source of supply, has ordered the China Railway Company, the China Transportation Company, and the China Steamship Company, Shanghai Inland River Steamship Company, and other land and water transportation agencies that from now on, when the rice control committee notifies these companies to transport rice to Shanghai, the companies should suspend other cargo transport and prioritize rice transport to help the people's food supply. This measure will have a considerable effect in helping to suppress rice prices.</p>
<h3>Yangzi Company Donates a Motorboat</h3>
<p>Kondo Yoshimi, representative of Yangzi Company at 10 North Suzhou Road, visited the Japanese Naval Attaché's Office at 3 PM on the 5th to donate a high-speed motorboat.</p>
<h3>Nanshi to Ration Coal Balls, Firewood, and Soap Starting Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Regarding the third-term rationed household coal balls and matches and the second-term soap for the seventh district (Nanshi) of this city, it is reported that the Municipal Economic Bureau has set the period from the 7th to the 17th of this month as the sales period. Each person can purchase 10 catties of coal balls per ticket at a price of 1 yuan and 8 jiao per catty, a small box of matches at a price of 3 yuan, and a bar of soap. Each bar, including the separately sold donation, costs 34 yuan and 2 jiao for Cow Brand, 35 yuan and 6 jiao for Henry, and 36 yuan and 4 jiao for Guben, Central, and Nanyang, 34 yuan for Mingxing, and 35 yuan and 7 jiao for Arrow. (The soap rationed by the bureau this time is all newly produced by various factories. Due to the rising cost of raw materials, the retail prices are slightly different.) However, both soap and matches must be purchased at the same time; one cannot choose to buy only one. Residents of Nanshi must hold their certificates and purchase from designated retailers within the above-mentioned period; it will be invalid if they purchase after the deadline.</p>
<h3>Sino-Japanese Cultural Association Holds Sketching Event</h3>
<p>In order to promote art, the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association of this city has specifically scheduled the first sketching event at 9:00 AM on June 11th at Hardoon Garden. All Chinese and Japanese painters or those interested in art can apply to participate from now on. If it rains on that day, the event will be postponed to the morning of the 18th of this month.</p>
<h3>Reportedly Nanshi Opium Dens to Close at End of Month</h3>
<p>After the gambling dens in Nanshi were ordered to close, the atmosphere of opium has not yet been eradicated. Old opium dens line the streets, openly allowing people to smoke opium, and the harm is getting worse, seriously undermining the foundation of the country. It is now learned that these old opium dens will be closed separately at the end of this month. The Smoke Prohibition Bureau has now stopped issuing licenses for opium dens. At that time, the opium atmosphere in Nanshi will often be completely eradicated. At the same time, the police stations in Nanshi have been ordered to set up opium user registration offices to handle the issuance of opium user licenses in order to allow all opium users in the district to quit within a time limit.</p>
<h3>Fisheries Administration Implements Fish Protection</h3>
<p>The Fisheries Administration of the Ministry of Industry is actively promoting the training of fishery police for fish protection work. It has established a preparatory office for the Fishery Police Training Institute on the Republic of China Road and decided to recruit 50 fishery police officers for short-term training, and purchased two 40-ton fish protection boats. Therefore, fish protection work will be implemented soon.</p>
<h3>Reader Aid to Education News</h3>
<p>Since the start of the seventh session of our newspaper's reader aid to education fund on June 1st, we are deeply concerned that the existing funds are limited and the budget is severely inadequate. We are appealing to all parties to raise donations. Fortunately, people from all walks of life have enthusiastically supported us, generously donating money, and gradually accumulating enough to reach the expected goal. Regarding application procedures, schools at all levels have successively reported lists of poor and outstanding students. This office will review them one by one. Application forms are being printed urgently. From the 15th onwards, schools can send staff to the office to collect them and distribute them for filling out. However, in recent days, there have still been some students who do not understand the application procedures and come to the office to collect forms. We hope that students will report to their class teachers or principals and avoid making unnecessary trips.</p>

<h3>French Concession Tramway Plans Improvement Measures</h3>
<p>Since the French Concession Tramway Company of this city implemented its driving time measures last winter, in general, the ticket sellers and drivers, restricted by the company's regulations, often do not stop at stations or stop only briefly before starting again, and even refuse passengers from getting off, resulting in repeated tragedies. This measure has already aroused deep concern in all walks of life. On April 7th of this year, Ms. Wang Feng from Shangyu was severely injured and lost both legs after being pushed off the bus, resulting in disability. The Shangyu and Shaoxing native associations organized a support association. In addition to requesting the judicial authorities to severely punish the perpetrators of the accident for the injuries caused to Wang Feng, in order to prevent similar tragedies from happening again in the future, they have submitted a proposal to the municipal government for approval, ordering the Transportation Improvement Committee to review the improvement plan and ordering the company to abolish the driving time restriction measures and improve them in order to maintain traffic safety.</p>

<h3>"Sufficient Food" First</h3>
<p>— Huang Xiao Zhou</p>
<p>"The people are the foundation of the nation, and food is the people's heaven." If the people's food problem is not resolved for even a day, the people's livelihood will not be stable for a day, and the impact on the foundation of the nation will be extremely significant. Recently, Shanghai citizens have repeatedly experienced delays in the distribution of household rice rations, forcing them to rely on the black market for daily food. The black market rice supply has also been unstable, leading to unprecedented price surges, causing great concern. The authorities recently promulgated the "Temporary Measures Outline for Grain Supply to the People of Beijing and Shanghai," easing restrictions and providing supplies in a flexible manner, in order to suppress the price of black market rice in Shanghai. However, whether the household rice ration distribution system can be improved in the future is what the citizens hope for day and night.</p>
<p>The promulgation of the "Temporary Measures Outline for Grain Supply to the People of Beijing and Shanghai" was originally intended to ease restrictions in order to balance rice prices in various regions and eliminate uneven regional distribution. If there are no special forces interfering with the results of such free buying and selling, it would be a good expedient measure. However, the current effect of this new measure is limited to enriching the supply and slightly lowering the price of black market rice, while citizens still have to rely on the black market as before. Moreover, now that the transportation and sale of rice are free, it is reasonable to expect that the selling price should not be too different from the purchase cost in the place of origin. However, excessive taxation and levies during transportation are unavoidable, and the burden will still fall on the citizens. As for whether profiteering by unscrupulous merchants and hoarding by wealthy households can be absolutely prevented, this is the most important issue. Otherwise, even if transportation and sales are free and the supply is smooth, if the price of rice remains firm or even increases, what benefit will it bring to the poor?</p>
<p>The current new measures for the people's food are still in their initial stages of implementation, and it is difficult to predict what the achievements will be. However, it is an undeniable fact that citizens still rely on the black market to supplement their household rice rations, and the black market price fluctuates from time to time due to various artificial reasons, making talk of stabilizing people's livelihood just empty words. What people hope for from the government authorities now is nothing more than to effectively improve procurement agencies, improve the distribution system, and ensure that the household rations are sufficient to "make a living" and eliminate the black market. Indeed, the means of assistance should be adapted to the time and place, but the ultimate goal is to achieve "sufficient food" (sufficient food from household rice rations).</p>
<p>However, judging from the authorities' intentions, the implementation of this new measure is nothing more than to 1) balance rice prices in various regions—so that there is no worry about "unevenness," and 2) increase rice prices in the producing areas, encouraging farmers to work hard in rice production—so that there is no worry about "scarcity." Therefore, we earnestly hope that after completing "evenness without scarcity," the authorities will be able to establish a sound distribution system and provide sufficient household rice rations, which would be a great blessing for the common people and a great blessing for the nation.</p>
<h3>Letter to My Sister (8)</h3>
<p>— Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>(Ah, I want to draw!)</p>
<p>In Takao's heart, there was an unexpected desire to draw. The feel of the canvas's elasticity that one feels while sketching, the smell of painting materials like palettes, these things are infinitely alluring to him.</p>
<p>(If I don't draw that, what am I going to draw? Such beautiful things!)</p>
<p>He somewhat regretted not bringing his art supplies box.</p>
<p>Facing the sea where the ship's shadow had already faded, he could only wield his imaginary brush endlessly, doing as he pleased and engaging in painting. Paintings without outlines appeared one after another on the green waves.</p>
<p>When the excitement calmed down a bit, he was surprised himself.</p>
<p>(What exactly is going on? I intended to abandon the brush and come to this place, but now that I'm here, I want to draw again. What exactly is going on?)</p>
<p>He was reminded of the kind of letter he wanted to write to his sister last night. Having hated painting so much, he had suddenly experienced, within just thirty minutes, such a drastic, unprecedented, and intense desire to paint, which really surprised him.</p>
<p>(Don't rush. Perhaps it's not necessary for me to throw away the brush, and I'm willing to paint again. Isn't it because I've seen beauty that cannot be painted?)</p>
<p>He suddenly felt that a dead end had opened up, and everything had become clear.</p>
<p>A painter who doesn't feel the beauty of an apple, no matter how he looks at it, is perhaps not a true painter. However, what does this mean? A painter who only paints warships is perhaps a naive and low-level painter, an artist who caters to children. But, isn't that also good? Even if he can't bear the name of a painter, even if he can't enter the ranks of artists, as long as he paints what he feels is beautiful, he can be worthy of heaven.——</p>
<h3>The Importance of Hygiene and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases</h3>
<p>— Gu Nan Qun</p>
<p>Today is the fifth day of the health campaign. Several gentlemen have already spoken about the necessity of hygiene and common hygiene knowledge. I, Nan Qun, have been running a hospital in Shanghai for twenty-seven years and am someone who actually serves the public health cause, so I would like to add a few practical words that apply to everyone.</p>
<p>Now that rice prices are so high and the prices of all goods are so great, and the prices of medicine are also rising along with commodity prices, middle-class families really cannot afford to get sick anymore. People on salaries find it difficult to maintain their normal lives, and when they get sick, it is truly impossible to solve. But illnesses arise whether one can afford them or not, so what should be done? The only thing to do is to prevent them from arising. Emphasize hygiene on a daily basis and study various preventive measures. Therefore, the higher the standard of living, the more we must focus on our bodies, because health is wealth.</p>
<p>The above words are intended to calculate the economic benefits for individuals or families. When it comes to careers, when it comes to the nation and the people, hygiene is even more worthy of attention. A person who emphasizes hygiene and has abundant energy can serve society until the age of seventy or eighty. A person who neglects hygiene will have weakened energy, and by the age of fifty or more, his spirit will be lacking and he will need to retire.</p>
<p>This is based on the general situation without special diseases. One must know that there are countless people who die young due to neglecting hygiene. According to statistics on the lifespan of people in countries with developed hygiene, they are indeed different from the masses. For example, the average lifespan of people in New Zealand can reach sixty-seven years, while the average lifespan of people in Europe and Russia is only forty-six or forty-seven years. This is not because a certain ethnic group has a particularly long or particularly short lifespan, but because of the emphasis on hygiene and the lack of emphasis on hygiene. Parents should have sound bodies, and children should live under hygienic conditions from infancy to childhood to adulthood to middle age to old age, and their lifespan will naturally be long.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, infectious diseases account for the majority of illnesses. Speaking of the sources of infectious diseases, of course, it is the work of microorganisms. According to research by bacteriologists, if a bacterium continues to grow for twenty-four hours in a suitable environment, it can reproduce to a line long enough to encircle the earth three times. It can be seen how formidable bacterial reproduction is. In this way, the horror of bacterial infection, if not prevented, will endanger human health, which is unbearable to contemplate.</p>
<p>The number of human deaths due to infectious diseases is actually more than deaths from other causes, especially in China's mortality rate, which accounts for almost two-thirds. According to the records of internal medicine patients in our Nanyang Hospital, among one hundred and forty consecutive patients, one hundred and eleven were infectious diseases, which proves that infectious diseases are too numerous and too terrible.</p>
<p>Although infectious diseases originate from microorganisms, some are acute and some are chronic. Speaking of Shanghai, it is a large metropolis in East Asia where people from all directions gather and travel frequently, and any bacteria can be brought in by attaching to people and objects. Now, let me briefly mention a few infectious diseases. In cold weather, there are measles, whooping cough, diphtheria, pneumonia, smallpox, meningitis, etc. In spring, there are typhus, relapsing fever, etc. In hot weather, there are gastrointestinal infections, typhoid fever, dysentery, cholera, etc. As for tuberculosis, syphilis, gonorrhea, the transmission power is also quite strong, but they do not distinguish seasons and exist all year round. Some infectious diseases are particularly easy to contract in children, so parents are more</p>
<p>As for prevention methods, countries with developed hygiene attach great importance to them. As a result, infectious diseases are relatively rare. Even medical schools find it difficult to find an infectious patient for teaching purposes. Looking at the people of the East and West who have developed hygiene, smallpox transmission is rare, so people with pockmarked faces are not commonly seen. On the contrary, in our country, they can be seen everywhere. From this point of view, we can prove the greatness of the preventive effect. The people of our country mostly ignore the prevention of infectious diseases. In recent years, the health authorities have actively planted smallpox vaccines and injected preventive vaccines, but the people regard it as a difficult road and are unwilling to accept it. They are unwilling to endure minor pain to obtain the safety of life, which is too careless about hygiene. From now on, from today on, I, Nan Qun, sincerely hope that all our fellow citizens in the city will work together to promote and pay attention to all daily hygiene activities, so that the people of our Republic of China can keep pace with the healthiest people in the world.</p>
