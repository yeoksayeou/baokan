<p>社評</p>
<h3>助學於興學</h3>
<p>助學運動近年來經各界提倡之後，氣象頗爲蓬勃，捐輪之人數與金額均逐漸增加，而本屆申請助學金之學生尤見擁擠。就此種現象加以觀察，可以得到種種事實上之認識：　社會上一般人士，漸能了解國家需要人材之急迫，與夫人材對於國家前途之重要，所以推其幼吾幼之心，傾義以助貧寒之子弟。　社會上一班人士，亦漸知敎育之重要性，尤知敎育應具有之普　性，故用集　成　之方法，而減少貧寒子弟對於求學上向　之撼。　一般家長無不願送其子弟入學，小言之希望其子弟在品學上有相當之修養，將來能自食其力，大言之希望其子弟成人立業，旣可報効國家，亦足以光耀門楣，故在　　不繼之時，猶　助學金之　注，以完成其子弟之學業。　一般靑年無不純　可愛，求知之慾勝於飲食，在家庭經濟壓追之下，不得不先謀糊口之計，以減其父母之擔負，但其內心所受失學之苦痛，往往非孝思所能抑制，而淸夜平旦難免不自悲而淚下。故遇有助學金之機會，必憑其成績之優秀，立旣申請，以期完成其理相之目的。</p>
<p>就　項而言，欲酬答社會人士之熱忱，其責任在中等以上之學校，務求以實際上所需要之質量為標準，造就人材以供國家社會之用。就　項而言，屬於普及敎育性質，其責任在中等以下之學校，務求學費低廉，水準相當，尤其應注意學生體格上思想上之健全，以副社會人士之期望。就　　兩項而言，雖其對象爲家長或爲靑年學子之本身，然學校方面應員之責任正與　　兩項相同，且更當警惕而免「誤人子弟」之　。</p>
<p>整個敎育問題，本是政府應辦事業之一端，若上海私立學校如斯之多，已是一種畸形狀態，姑不在此詳論。當此戰時，政府未能兼籌。因此社會人士鼓其「匹夫有責」之精神，自願爲政府分勞。不過事有表理，名有虛實，務其表不求其裏，見其虛而勿其實，則熱忱之代價或有不足以達成所期許者。故資力更較雄厚之社會先進，已有推動興學之措施，或醵資設立理想的中學，或計劃創辦切實的職業學校，此皆興學精神之表現，以挽　風爲職志，與助學運動相得益彰。苟能先在滬地一　，各級學校皆有一切切實實之模範，則人皆有是非之心而判其優劣，人皆有差惡之心而知所取捨，相習相競而後能整飭學風，並所以副上述四點之期望，創辦新校所需之人力物力必多，故亦可取執中辦法，就原有之學校加以整理與資助，似較輕而易舉，去年七月二十九日本報國民論壇中會披露陳紹　先生所發表之「從助」學」運動談到助「校」運動」，意似在此。其中論列頗詳，多足發人猛省面供吾人參考者。當時惜已近各校學年開始之際，或未及爲社會所注意與採納，茲特及早提出，以備有心人士之　討。</p>
<p>吾人對於教育事業之一貫主張，爲求達到普及教育與夫培養人村之目的，故於呼籲助學金之餘，更論興學之義。</p>

<p>濟南十七日中央社電　吳化文將軍參加和渾以來，於茲已一週年。吳將軍所部國軍第三方面軍，其精誠團結之毅志，與建國剿共之决意，益形堅强。吳將軍自客歲一月，率部四萬餘，參加和運後，對共匪渝軍，即積極剿討。五月初旬，於魯南對渝軍于學忠部第百十三師百十四師，予以璣滅打擊，釀成于學忠由山東撤退之一大因素。此外注力剿擊共匪，警備正面敵軍，片刻不息，連續鬥爭，予渝共以極重損失。茲誌第三方面軍參加和運以來一年間，所獲綜合戰果如次：交戰次數二八四入，渝共軍交戰兵力五一八四○○，收容渝共軍棄屍六六八四，判明渝共軍負傷者一一五四三人，俘虜渝共軍二八八五外，鹵獲品計重機槍十二，輕機槍九六，平射砲一，投彈簡三四，步槍三九其三，手槍五五，手溜彈八三九七，無綫電機三。又覆滅渝共軍設施，計兵營，兵工廠，糧秣廠，及其他共四二二所，收獲煊赫戰果。同時吳將軍對文化之振興，經濟之建設，民生之救濟等設施，均積極進行，以圖民衆之更生。故吳將軍防地民衆，對之無不崇敬也。</p>

<h3>太平洋戰局的展望（一）</h3>
<p>大東亞戰爭的决戰情勢，在東西兩方均愈趨激烈。尤其在新不列頤島，敵人的反攻，雖然付出了很大的犧牲，消耗，迄無何等重大的戰果可舉。然而敵方為消弭彌漫的厭戰氣氛，更為布置本年秋的大總統改選，今後繼續猛烈進攻，自在意料之中，而印度洋及北太平洋的阿留申羣島亦　成為大規模反攻的出發點。關於作戰的推移，固然，我們絕對信賴前綫無敵的陸海軍將士，毫無不安，但國家總力的發揮，為戰事勝利的不可缺的要素。在近代戰中，正確地把握戰局的眞相，舉國完成戰鬥配置的國民，可以戴上勝利的榮冠，反之者失敗，還在歷史上常有明證。際此轉變世界歷史，决日本三千年命運的决戰年，後方一億人民，對於在日本四周海域展開中的戰局，自應有透徹的認識。戰史這樣吿訴我們：「敵傾全力前來挑戰時，予敵人以猛烈打擊，使飽嘗戰爭的慘禍，就是進一步接近勝利的時候一。現在正是决勝　，勝利的機會即將到來，抓住呢，放走呢；這一個關鍵，不但在前綫將士的手裏、而且也在後方民衆的手裏。</p>
<p>北太平洋</p>
<p>海洋作戰的耍諦之一，為如何利用氣象。所以此方面現在沒有大規模的戰事者，乃因大艦隊的出動及向前進基地的兵站補元，被阻於流冰的狂瀾怒濤，不能如意的緣故。但自日軍從阿留申撤退後，敵方即動員建設飛機塲部隊，整備最前進基地阿圖島，基斯加島。例如在阿圖島，已經完成了二所飛機塲，長距離的大型轟炸機巳可自由升降，向北千島，幌筵等地試行威力偵察的攻擊。</p>
<p>寬七十呎，每月有數萬噸運輸力的阿拉斯加公路，正在最大限度上加以利用。敵北洋作戰的據點達奇哈巴，軍需品堆如山積，漸次運向前進基地。在達奇哈巴，科却克，諾姆，阿姆蒂托加克爾茨克，加羅洛，阿開茲，基斯加，阿圖島等地，以重轟炸機爲主力的飛機已有約一千架，陸軍部隊包括阿拉斯加在內約六個師團，更配有戰車，裝甲車，降落傘部隊等。至海上的艦艇勢力，據北方前基地來的報道，有特設航空母艦二艘，巡洋艦二艘，驅逐艦及其他若干。去年十二月二十一日，美海軍部發表，任命法蘭克·弗烈樞中將為北太平洋水域海軍司令官，從這裏也可推測該區域已配置了相當程度的艦隊。</p>
<p>這阿留申一條路，本來是美國的空軍第一論者亞力山大，P，塞威爾斯基所說：，徹底的轟炸日本本土的作戰基地，非阿拉斯加，或阿留申不可。」著名的軍事評論家也贊同塞威爾斯基的意見說：」太平洋戰爭勝利之鍵在於北方」，主張從中南太平洋跳島進攻奢對這路綫亦以為是「對日跳板」，而致絕大的期待。現在正是暴風雨前夕的準備期。第八十四屆已會中，島田海相說：「北太平洋的防衛愈固，攻擊準備亦已就緒」，日本也以此路作為進向美洲大陸的跳板，取待機跳躍的姿勢。</p>
<p>中太平洋</p>
<p>柴崎少將以下四千五白將士，盡忠的血潮，染紅了達拉瓦，瑪金島的珊瑚礁，自殉國之日起，一個多月來，敵方在達拉瓦，瑪金島消耗了二千九百噸的鋼鐵量，犧牲登陸部隊一萬數千，聲沈艦船二十餘艘，編成「海底大空母集團」，使吉爾伯特後方，馬紹爾諸島的日軍海空基地，獲得內綫作戰的有利態勢，佈置了有力的陣綫。這由於馬紹爾島的空戰及接踵而至的敵機來襲米萊島，瑪洛愛刺普礁島，泰洛阿島等，受到猛烈打擊的事實，也可以明瞭。</p>
<p>可是我們不能不注意者，此方面的敵空軍也已整備完成。在十二月五日的馬紹爾羣島空戰中，敵方以航空母艦二艘為主力的機動部隊前來出擊，用艦上轟炸機，艦上戰鬥機約百架來攻擊日本基地。航空母艦突入陸上基地航空部隊勢力圈中心的不利，乃是大東亞戰爭開戰以來的戰訓，尤其在吉爾伯特，波根維爾島周圍的空戰中，更得了深刻的敎訓；但是敵人還是用航空母艦前來出擊，這說明了當時此方面的敵陸上基地還沒有供給有力航空部隊使用的能力，有長距離航續力的大型機沒有結果。</p>
<p>然而十日以後，敵空軍的出擊馬紹爾羣島，每次均為四引擎，載有乘員七·八名的大型轟炸機康素里台德型，廿架卅架編隊來炸，這種參數大型機同時作戰的態勢，就是敵方陸上基地航空部隊已吿强化的證明。不過現在敵方的出擊馬紹爾羣島，與其說是真正的攻擊，倒不如說是爲防禦日機的轟炸敵方增援補充。關於敵方中央侵攻路的目的，敵方報道也說是「經由南洋而直指日本本土的作戰一，但其實際，吉爾伯特強化之後，敵方以日本戰略圈內南洋為目標，將試行第三次出擊，與南太平洋形成鉗形攻勢，所以此方面的戰事，應嚴予警戒。（翔：譯自一月一日續資報知）</p>

<h3>三省兩市同義區域內　米穀自由移動　米統會函三省兩市當局</h3>
<p>中央社訊　米糧統制委員會爲蘇浙皖米穀運銷管理暫行條例，業經行政院於去年十一月二十五日修正通過，公佈實施在案，茲聞該會爲求調劑鄕村與城市之民食恐慌起見，依據該條文第五條之規定，昨特分函三省政府，曁南京上海兩特別市政府，予以解釋，並請其通飭所屬佈吿人民一體遵照、大意略謂：凡屬蒼民，將其收穫之米穀，在同一鄕村或從鄕村運至縣城以內，准許自由移動。若非自已所收獲之米穀，而在同一管理區內僅為其自已消費之用，則限定在八公斤以內，亦得自由搬運，但關於上海統制綫以內移動米穀，另有規定，所有在統制綫以外之人民，均准按此辦理。</p>
<h3>防空訓練　成績尚稱美滿　日陸海軍防空司令部談話</h3>
<p>為中央社訊　十三日至十五日之防空訓練期問，業巳終了，成績尙稱美滿，日陸海軍防空司令部當局特發表談話如次：</p>
<p>此次訓練時期，雖僅二日，但本市各方面能認淸目前戰局，始終熱心努力，完成預期目的，本當局極感滿意，在近代作戰都巿，必有遭受空襲之處，為最近歐洲之空戰，其廣範團之轟炸，雖為後方都市，全市市民亦被捲入戰爭旋過，本市巿民，無論中日外人，必須軍官民一體，使防空陣容更加强化，以備敵人來襲，確立憑付對策。</p>
<p>今次訓練成績，較去年更使人滿意，但徵諸近代的空襲都市實情，尙有不少缺點，今再列舉各注意事項，列舉各事項前，榮經再三警吿，但應加改善之處猶多，此點殊表遣憾，希望各市民再加注意，不待下次之訓練，立即加以改善，俾隨時均能應付空襲，最後對市民諸位之努力，深表感謝。</p>
<h3>注意事項　各國人民之協力</h3>
<p>經數次訓練，成績頗佳，惟以各國人民語言隔膜，意思不能互達，致有合作不能徹底等事，今後對防空用語及各種章程信號等，加以研究。</p>
<p>各種管制之徹底</p>
<p>燈火管制一，燈火管制，此次尙未見良好，從地上觀察，雖未見燈光外洩，但自飛機或自高層建築物而觀，仍時有燈光　露，尤以蘇州河以南地區更甚，大部因鬧巿街之側背部窗門及住宅天窗，遮光之不完全所致。二，第一日侵農，開始訓練時，警戒管制狀况，極不良好，今後須有準備管制發令時間內，即應準備警報之隨時發令。三，燈火管制時，因不加遮蔽，仍有洩光，又警戒管制時，尙有汽車完全無燈行駛，或有汽車開强烈光度之電燈，今後須加改善。</p>
<p>音響交通管制　音響交通管制，大體尙稱良好，但空襲警報時，華人行人依然不絕，警戒警報命令發生後，無緊急事故者，應停止外出，靜候家中。</p>
<p>多數塲所同時受炸及高處受炸時之處理法寫字間區域一般人，均表不熱心，實施被害及避難訓練者極少，殊屬遺憾。</p>
<p>訓練水準向上</p>
<p>比上次進步極速，但尙有發生人聲太雜，每一訓練處人員過多，反使工作效率滅低、指導人員須指揮部下，俾工作進行順利。　與隣近自　團合作不密切，借用各種用具時，有被拒絕者，因此發生不便，今後保甲須有互助精神，作更進一步的合作。　除防空工作人員以外之一般人對防空漠不關心，頗有人對於防空工作視為一種戲劇，旁觀欣賞者，殊屬不當。</p>
<p>各種綜合訓練</p>
<p>各種訓練時，指導人員指揮尙有不徹底，致引起混亂，故班長須考慮班員人數，作適切的指揮。　對於一假想受害地點，工作進行，每多與其他工作相混雜，使其他工作進行受到障碍，指導人員須權衡工作輕重緩急，立加判斷，作適切之措置。</p>
<p>受傷者救護法</p>
<p>治創傷方法，各部均能迅速運用，綳帶術成　已良好，但對止血處置，未曾實習。　受傷者之搬運法，各部均能迅速處理，但對下列事項，須加硏究實習。</p>
<p>一·救護指揮人員對指揮工作未能徹底，因此發生混亂影響防火防毒工作。二·在出事地點之救急工作位置，以不受烟火或毒瓦斯，並不妨碍其他工作為原則。三·担架法以迅速為要，對於受傷者綁　過於粗暴，又上海地域之演習，成績殊佳。</p>

<h3>評言　生產者之保護</h3>
<p>今年是增產的一年，也就是增加大東亞戰爭力量的一年，所以我們不憚煩覆，凡認為與生產問題相關聯者，言之惟恐不盡。此次全國經濟委員會在京召開第三次全體委員會議：主席親書訓詞，略謂今年經濟建設，置重點於增產，所謂增產，以糧食增產棉花增產二者為先，且農業之外，尤須注意於輕工業，如紗布麵粉諸工業皆是。足見不言增產則已，否則無論為農業生產，工業生產，耍管以人民之衣食兩項，為增犛的唯一對象，因為「安內」方可以「攘外」，這是一個制勝的原則。</p>
<p>回到增產的本題上，我們感覺主席訓詞中有一句話是時別値得我們擁護的，就是：「政府方面應注全力於生產者之保獲，務使生產者能享受生產所得。」何為生產者之保護？一切對於生產者之外來滋擾，如匪共之刦奪，不宵官吏之中鉋，不良軍隊之敲剝，務必禁絕，這當然是其一種解釋；其另一種解釋，就是去年國慶紀念日，本欄於論「增加農工生產」中所說的，國家對於農工增產，須寓保護於獎勵之中，其辦法有如　特別注重保障農民生產者之收益，以獎勵其再生產，　特別注重勞動福利事業之推進，以保障工人的生活，　扶植民間正當企業團體，以策勵其對於民生日用必需品的生產。</p>

<h3>日大使館事務所舉行　官民懇談會　谷大使臨致訓</h3>

<p>談內容</p>
<p>加强官民聯絡，使處在指導地位之大使館與擔任實際業務之業商間關係更加密切，在事務上或其他等點，大使館方面有欠周密之處，業商則　最言獻意見，大使館方面亦盡最大努力，迅速處理事務。　各業負責者親自指揮，爲增強生產·促進收買，各業負責者應率先親自指揮，以中日新關係透澈至下屬機構。　重點配置人力資源，健量使人力資源配置重要部門。　活用物力資源，爲謀活用原料資材，各業應加強　的連絡，互通有無，以有限之資材，舉十分之效果，技術問題亦宜如此。</p>
<p>谷大使詞　總力戰爭勇往直前</p>
<p>略謂：此次世界大戰，其範圍之廣大，戰况之凄烈，為有史以來得未曾有，地球上各主要國家，分成兩個陣營，不是己方，便是敵方，正進行大决戰。在此次戰爭中，决不容許妥協而絕國家之命運，唯有獲勝或是滅亡，我日本作戰之大東亞戰爭亦如是，正是决定我大和民族命運之大血戰，徵諸過去戰局，英美野心益露，然我大和民族在旣往每逢國難，均賴發揚團體之精華，克服萬難，使國運之與隆，此為肇國以來歷史所昭示者，故舉國人民，無輪前綫後方，應舉其總力，使敵人屈膝為止。吾人需前之戰爭，為舉國家全力之戰爭，雖前綫將士善謀勇戰，但萬一後方有一人不　職守，則大東亞戰爭不能勝利，尤其本年是大東亞戰爭决戰之第三年，乃最重要之一年，或勝或敗，胥在此一年，若國民認情時局，勇往直前，則光榮之勝利，必在於我固不容疑義。</p>
<p>中日關係入新階段</p>
<p>去歲一月九日，國民政府宣吿參戰，中日兩國之關係，進入同生共死的密切階段。日本政府為適應此新關係，乃决定對華新政策之根本方針，邇來根據新方針付諸實施，所謂新政策乃是尊重國民政府自全與責任，極力促進其自動性的活動，並加强國民政府之指導力量，例如交還租界，交還北京使館區域，撤廢課稅權，處理敵產，調整中日合辦公司，强化商統會，及其下部機構，凡此種種，均為新政策之具體表現。所謂新政策並非新的政策，即為將日本在歷年來因受外來阻碍欲行而不能實行之政策，此次付諸實行而已。新政策爲中日間本來關係之　現，亦為日本應當如是的措置，日本對華根本方針之推進，更進一步締結同盟條約，以代舊基本條約，又有大東亞共同宣言之發表。此於中國自發生中日事變以來，已歷六年，該時期內為遂行戰爭行為，引起各種事態，故目前之現狀，與日本目標之事態，尙有相當距離，但使中日兩國關係恢復，如同盟條約及大東亞共同宣言所揭示之正常關係，此為决戰第三年之吾人重大使命，中日正常關係確立，始有大東亞新秩序，東亞新秩序完成，帝國始能自存自衛。</p>
<p>努力樹立友好關係</p>
<p>同時東亞亦能安定，决非過甚其詞。徵諸莫斯科會談，開羅會談之純過，中日事變完全是世界戰爭之一　，吾人之對手决非重慶之一軍閥或一政客，乃是中國四萬萬民心，重慶之軍閥政客，不顧日本公正之政策，而追隨英美之後，則被與衷心存念中國之中國人間，隔膜更遠。大東亞戰爭已進入第三年，日本國內各股體制益加完備，國民士氣愈加昻楊，吾等在華同胞，宜加反省，對於職業之配置，商行之業務，固能合乎國內體制乎？檢討能達到中日共存共榮之地步乎？願我在華同胞，儘量以工作事務，委諸與中國人士，以合國內勞務動員計劃。今日在座諸位均為盡力於實業界等各方面之先進，如容余率直申　意見，將為諸位所首肯，即由來上海為英美色彩最濃厚之地方，上海租界雖已收回，敵產亦逐步加以處理，然欲排除中國人心中之英美，誠非易事，余嘗聞中國某要人言，上海人是異於中國人的一種獨特的人種，諸君在獨特的氣氛中，日常與中國人接觸，諒諸位極費苦心，諸位為樹立中日友好關係而努力，其努力可謂必有效果，余乘今日此一機會，希望諸位對下列三點，切實實行：（一）積極協力增强戰力，（二）以互惠為基礎實行中日經濟提携，（三）實踐道義精神。</p>

<h3>北站秩序有待撤底改善</h3>
<p>— 山錯</p>
<p>困累行旅巳久之北站秩序，自經中日當局議决於一月一日起廢止普遍檢查旅客後·進出站門，固已稍便，但因站內外旅客衆多，擁擴之狀，仍不少襄，婦孺衰老；時聞軋傷。加之車票不易購得，諸如此類，仍朱能澈底解除旅客痛苦。一方面由於單帮販尸之大量活動；而另一方面鐵道制度之有待改善，亦無可諱。竊願華中鐵道公司當局，能進一步實行改善，其辦法實簡便可行，而造福嘉恵於旅客者實大，爰就管窺，曥列如左：</p>
<p>（一）恢復南站，改南下海杭車由南站開行，使往沿海杭綫之旅客，改由南站進出，則北站旅客之擁擠程度，至少可減少三分一之一以上，否則或在就近如天通庵站等另闢一站進</p>
<p>（二）旅客進入北站後，仍須等待至開車前一刻鐘方始軋票上車，使旅客排列等候，以致站內仍躋軋不堪，買票爲難，當局有擬拆除站內售票房以容納之議。實則祗須將軋票制恢復戰前辦法，改爲隨到隨軋，使旅客逕至月台登車，容納於火車上·蓋火車由北站開出，車輛固早已在站，並無不便，一方面則站內旅客自不致再形擁擠，而秩序井然矣。</p>
<p>（三）增加班次及車輛，現在每班客車開出，擁擠異常，毫無秩序與衛生可言。亟望華中鐵道當局能增加班次，例如自午時十二時車開出後，直至午後四時，方有軍開出，其間四小時中，儘可增加班次，再不然，則先行增加拖車，其辦法可逐站解脫。例如最末二節，開至蘇州站開脫留蘇，次二節開至無錫站開脫留錫等，開回時再逐站加上，如此則旣可使旅客便利舒適，同時又可達到用煤經濟之目的也。（移酬助學）</p>
<h3>海軍　立志（七）</h3>
<p>— 岩田豐雄著洪羊譯</p>
<p>實際說起來，匯英戰爭，雖然是一個激烈戰爭，同時還不免有疏忽的地方。譬如像西瓜船的計畫，就是一個好例。這是由斬殺英人的奈良原發起的組織八十餘名的敢死隊，分乘於七艘西瓜船上，俱各化作商人模樣，懷中藏刀一口，登上英艦，斬殺英八－同時由隘上放砲，彼我俱沉於海底的計晝。猛然一聽，好像是一個名案，但是一般歐美人並不很喜歡西瓜，所以他們也沒有買這麼多的西瓜的理由。而且，敢死隊的人們，雖然自已以爲是變作商人模樣，然而目光烱烱，腰藏大刀，英艦自然是要作警戒的。這倘計畫，雖然終歸失敗了，但那隊員中，有後來的大山元帥，尤其是有同日本海軍關係極深的西鄕從道元帥，和仁禮景範大將，亦在其內，是不可或忘的。而且，東鄕元帥，年方十七，也在此役中，初次出征，在砲台上從事奮鬥，使他　從海上來的敵人，必須在海上防禦！的堅固信念，成了一句名言。</p>
<p>正式的開戰，是在七月二日的正午，一個暴風雨的當中。從來，鹿兒島這地方，每逢外國船來的時候，總是要起暴風雨的，這回也不例外，在狂風暴雨中，將兵們赤着身體先從南端的天保山砲台，放了第一砲。這就是開戰的號砲，各砲台也繼續的開砲了。正同那忘却不了的十二月八日黎明，向在上海的英船「彼得勒爾」號發放的巨砲一樣。</p>
<p>還有一點和今次戰爭相似的地方，就是在英國方面，誤認日本沒有職意的。不過是爲威嚇而採取的攻勢，而並非實際在準備戰爭。在這個時候，從各砲台發出必死的射擊，所以一時不知如何處置。像巴沙斯號，竟慌忙的割棄了船鏵，而逃遁了。在任何國家的海軍棄錨而逃，這是一種奇恥大辱。旗艦「猶利亞斯」，念遽駛至離海岸約有一里半遠的地點，開始了砲擊，但那兒正有練習用的標的的地方，所以從薩摩的砲台發出了正確無此的砲彈。雖然是舊式的圓彈，而三彈正中英艦上，甲板破毀，艦長和副艦長當塲受傷。</p>
<p>薩摩方面損害，也相當重大。薩摩的大砲，射程不過二里，而對方的艦砲可達七里之遙。而且薩摩的總砲數是八十九門，而英艦方面是一百令一門。祗園洲的砲台，損害最大，大砲好像軟糖似的彎曲着，砲合巳經被擊毀，不堪使用了。然而，士氣絲毫朱爲所挫，在風雨之中，號令的大鼓，震天的响着。那時的少年鼓手，就是後來的伊東元帥。（二）（十）（七）</p>

<h3>Assisting Education Through Promoting Schools</h3>
<p>In recent years, the movement to assist education has gained momentum through the promotion of various sectors, with a vigorous atmosphere. The number of donors and the amount of donations have gradually increased, and the number of students applying for scholarships in this session is particularly crowded. Observing this phenomenon, we can gain various factual understandings: People in the general public are gradually realizing the urgency of the country's need for talent and the importance of talent to the country's future. Therefore, they extend their love for their own children to assist children from poor families. People in the general public are also gradually recognizing the importance of education, especially the universality that education should possess. Therefore, they use collective methods to reduce the anxieties of poor children in seeking education. All parents wish to send their children to school. In the small sense, they hope that their children will have considerable cultivation in character and academics and will be able to support themselves in the future. In the broad sense, they hope that their children will become adults and establish careers, not only to serve the country but also to bring honor to their families. Therefore, even when their resources are insufficient, they still pay attention to scholarships to complete their children's education. All young people are pure and lovely, and their desire for knowledge surpasses their desire for food and drink. Under the pressure of family finances, they have to seek ways to make a living first to reduce the burden on their parents, but the pain of being deprived of education in their hearts is often unbearable, and they cannot help but feel sad and shed tears in the quiet nights. Therefore, when there is an opportunity for scholarships, they must apply based on their excellent grades, hoping to achieve their ideal goals.</p>
<p>From this perspective, to repay the enthusiasm of people in society, the responsibility lies with schools at the secondary level and above, striving to cultivate talent based on the actual needs of quantity and quality for the use of the country and society. From this perspective, belonging to the nature of universal education, the responsibility lies with schools at the secondary level and below, striving for low tuition fees and reasonable standards, especially paying attention to the physical and mental well-being of students to meet the expectations of people in society. Regarding both of these perspectives, although the targets are parents or the young students themselves, the responsibilities of the schools are the same as in both of those mentioned before, and they should be even more vigilant to avoid "misleading young people."</p>
<p>The entire education problem is originally one aspect of the undertakings that the government should handle. The fact that there are so many private schools in Shanghai is already an abnormal state, which will not be discussed in detail here. During this wartime, the government has been unable to plan for everything. Therefore, people in society are encouraging their spirit of "everyone has a responsibility" and are voluntarily sharing the government's burden. However, things have appearances and realities, and names have emptiness and substance. If we only pursue the appearance without seeking the reality, and only see the emptiness without actualizing it, then the price of enthusiasm may not be enough to achieve what is expected. Therefore, social pioneers with more abundant resources have already taken measures to promote schools, either by contributing funds to establish ideal middle schools or by planning to establish practical vocational schools. These are all expressions of the spirit of promoting schools, taking it as their mission to reverse the prevailing trends and complementing the movement to assist education. If we can first establish a model in Shanghai where all levels of schools are practical and realistic, then people will have a sense of right and wrong and judge their merits and demerits, and people will have a sense of love and hate and know what to choose and discard. By learning from each other and competing with each other, we can rectify the atmosphere of learning and thus meet the expectations of the above four points. The human and material resources required to establish new schools must be large, so we can also take a moderate approach by reorganizing and assisting existing schools, which seems lighter and easier to do. In the National Forum of this newspaper on July 29 last year, Mr. Chen Shao  revealed his "From the Movement of Assisting 'Scholarships' to the Movement of Assisting 'Schools'", which seems to be the meaning of this. The discussion is quite detailed, and much is enough to inspire people to wake up and provide us with reference. At that time, it was a pity that it was near the beginning of the school year in various schools, and it may not have been noticed and adopted by society. Now, it is brought up early for discussion by those who are interested.</p>
<p>Our consistent advocacy for the education cause is to achieve the goals of universal education and cultivating talent, so in addition to calling for scholarships, we also discuss the meaning of promoting schools.</p>
<h3>Aviation Industry Association Established - Japanese Prime Minister Personally Sends Congratulatory Message - Encouraging Close Cooperation to Increase Aircraft Production</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Minister of Munitions Tojo, who also serves as the military minister, delivered a congratulatory speech at the establishment ceremony of the Aviation Industry Association. The main points are as follows: What Japan needs most in military terms now is to increase the production of aircraft to be used in combat. This matter is already unnecessary to repeat. Here, aviation industry personnel are gathered together to hold the establishment ceremony of the Aviation Industry Association. With close cooperation between the government and the people, we will jointly promote the production of aviation weapons and related materials. I am sincerely happy for the country. I deeply hope that this association will immediately launch active activities to contribute to the aircraft production planned by the Ministry of Munitions. Rapidly producing a large number of aircraft has become the focus of Japan's munitions industry today. All government officials and civilians are the backbone of Japanese aircraft production and have close ties with aircraft production. I hope that everyone will cooperate closely, using their abundant experience to make up for the shortcomings of the government's power, and work together to advance aircraft production. The government believes that the purpose of establishing the Aviation Industry Association is in line with the country's major expectations, so it expresses its infinite respect.</p>
<h3>Japanese Government Selects - First Batch of Munitions Companies</h3>

The designation decree awarding ceremony was held at the Prime Minister's official residence on the 17th. This law, which is being implemented in conjunction with the streamlining of unified production administration, is of great significance in enhancing military strength. It is expected to begin practical activities soon, and the prospects for actively enhancing military strength, centered on aircraft, are even more promising. On the one hand, since the establishment of the Japanese Ministry of Munitions, it has begun to adjust the ordering of important munitions materials and handle the affairs or maintenance of the Aviation Weapons Bureau. The Munitions Control Department is striving to increase production in terms of equipment, machinery, materials, labor, and electricity. The above streamlining and strengthening of production administration have made considerable progress. Japanese civilians are also calling on the government to actively promote various maintenance tasks. Today, a situation in which military officials and civilians are working together to increase aircraft production several times has been completed.</p>
<h3>Awarding of Designation Decrees - Ceremony Held at the Prime Minister's Residence</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - In order to strive for victory in the third year of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese government is actively increasing aircraft production and vigorously producing other munitions. Success is being achieved. The Japanese government, based on the Munitions Company Ordinance, is designating various munitions companies responsible for this production, to establish a production responsibility system with a clear national character for the enterprise, in order to achieve the production increase target in both quality and quantity of munitions production. Various preparations are now underway. The first batch of designated munitions companies has been decided to be 150 companies related to the four ministries of the Army, Navy, Munitions, Transportation, and Communications. The designation decree awarding ceremony was held at the Prime Minister's official residence at 10:00 a.m. on the 17th. Those present on the government side were Prime Minister Tojo, who is also the Minister of the Army, the Minister of Munitions, Navy Minister Shimada, Transportation and Communications Minister Hatta, State Minister Kishi, and various related officials. On the company side, there were more than 150 people, including Mr. Uryu, the manager of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. After the ceremony, the four ministers of Munitions, Army, Navy, Transportation, and Communications presented the designation decrees to the representatives of the munitions companies. At 10:10, Prime Minister Tojo, who is also the Minister of Munitions, delivered a speech. Then, Mr. Toyota, the president of Nippon Steel Corporation, delivered a reply on behalf of the companies. The awarding ceremony was completed at 10:30. It is reported that the 150 companies designated this time are producers of aircraft and aircraft-related military equipment, general military equipment, shipbuilding, steel, iron, light metals, mechanized chemistry, oil, grease, mineral oil, and vehicle industries. In addition, each of these companies, after receiving the designation decree, will select a person in charge of production within two weeks, and after obtaining the permission of the competent minister, will begin to be active. It is worth looking forward to. Moreover, the companies designated this time are the most important and essential for munitions production, and they were designated after careful selection. The second batch of designated companies will reach a considerable number.</p>

<h3>Dr. Okada Invents - New Method for Treating Cancer</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - According to a Nagoya telephone report: The treatment of cancer has been a long-standing problem that has not been resolved despite the painstaking research of the medical community in the past. Now, Dr. Kiyosaburo Okada of the Faculty of Medicine at Nagoya University has invented a treatment method. The method was announced in 1940, but this treatment involves injecting cancer essence extracted from 20-day rat cancer into the static group to destroy cancer cells and cause them to die. The results of animal experiments are used in the human body. According to recent clinical trials, the treatment of stomach cancer, esophageal cancer, breast cancer, uterine cancer, liver cancer, etc., has achieved good results, and there have been no recurrences for two and a half years after treatment. Many patients have returned to their original health before treatment, which has attracted the attention of the academic community. The following is a statement by Dr. Okada: Whether cancer can be completely cured requires long-term observation. In general, cancer is easier to treat in the early stages, and it is difficult to treat when the symptoms worsen and the cancer grows. Sometimes, complications such as stenosis and perforation often lead to deterioration. My treatment method recognizes that cancer patients, after being cured, should be able to work the same as healthy people. There are also many who can work for two and a half years from the start of treatment. Leaving aside the technical clinical treatment for the time being, I have particular confidence in the possibility of a cure.</p>

<h3>Zhang Yipeng - Addresses Staff</h3>

Fortunately, he succeeded Luo Gong, and the wealth will not be lost. The Ministry of Justice and the Judicial Organization must be as the body that uses the arm, and the arm that uses the finger. The various institutions within the Ministry are also like this. From an objective point of view, the position of the Minister is the highest, but in fact, each department has its own special responsibilities and its own communication relationships. Internally and externally, successively and horizontally, the expression of political power lies entirely in this. Although the official ranks are of different sizes, the efforts of each person to fulfill their own responsibilities are the same. Life should be stable, and body and mind work should also be stable. All members of the department must work together and be responsible for their own duties. Yipeng is willing to take full responsibility and will never make things difficult for his colleagues. Former Minister Luo is now the Governor of Anhui Province and has agreed to continue to assist in the affairs of the Ministry. This is especially gratifying to Yipeng. A reporter from the Central News Agency went to interview the Minister in order to understand his policy direction and was granted an audience. He briefly stated that he has not yet fully reviewed all the files. The current plan is to first select talents to strengthen the promotion of judicial administration, and then adjust the judicial personnel in various places. The future policy direction and the points that should be promoted or reformed can only be told after reviewing all the files.</p>

In order to inquire about Luo's policy direction after taking office, a reporter went to interview him yesterday (the 17th) at 4:00 p.m. Luo personally granted an audience and spoke about the key points of governance in the future, saying, "I have not yet taken office, so I do not yet fully understand the situation in Anhui Province. However, the focus of future promotion will not be beyond three aspects, namely:  The work of Qingxiang in Anhui Province, which was in the preparatory stage in the past, will now enter the practical stage.  The training of security teams and police, etc., has achieved considerable results in the past. In order to ensure security in the future, it should be further strengthened.  Anhui is an important transportation hub connecting the north and south, and a distribution area for materials. In order to make the flow more smooth in the future, it is particularly hoped that we will focus on increasing production and stabilizing people's livelihood in order to work together to complete the Greater East Asia War.</p>

It is scheduled to be exhibited at the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association in Nanjing for four days from January 17th to 20th, and then in Shanghai from January 23rd to 30th, in Suzhou from February 5th to 7th, and in Xuzhou and other places from February 13th to 15th.</p>
<h3>Prospects for the Pacific War (1)</h3>
<p>The decisive battle situation of the Greater East Asia War is becoming increasingly fierce in both the East and the West. Especially on New Britain Island, the enemy's counterattacks, although entailing great sacrifices and attrition, have not yielded any major victories. However, in order to eliminate the pervasive war-weariness and to prepare for the presidential election this autumn, the enemy is expected to continue its fierce offensive. The Indian Ocean and the Aleutian Islands in the North Pacific have also become starting points for large-scale counterattacks. Regarding the progress of the war, we have absolute faith in the invincible soldiers of the land and sea forces on the front lines and have no anxiety. However, the full exertion of national strength is an indispensable element for victory in war. In modern warfare, a nation that accurately grasps the truth of the war situation and completes its combat deployment can wear the crown of victory, while the opposite is true for failure, as history has often demonstrated. At this juncture of transforming world history and deciding the three thousand-year fate of Japan, the one hundred million people in the rear should have a thorough understanding of the war situation unfolding in the waters surrounding Japan. War history tells us: "When the enemy challenges us with all their might, we must inflict a fierce blow on them and make them suffer the horrors of war, which is a step closer to victory." Now is the time for decisive victory, and the opportunity for victory is about to arrive. Whether we seize it or let it go, this key lies not only in the hands of the soldiers on the front lines but also in the hands of the people in the rear.</p>
<p>North Pacific</p>
<p>One of the key points of naval warfare is how to utilize the weather. The reason why there are no large-scale battles in this area now is that the movement of large fleets and the replenishment of forward bases are hindered by the raging waves of drifting ice and cannot proceed as desired. However, since the Japanese army withdrew from the Aleutians, the enemy has mobilized construction of airfields and troops to prepare the forward bases of Attu Island and Kiska Island. For example, on Attu Island, two airfields have been completed, and long-range large bombers can freely take off and land, conducting reconnaissance attacks on the northern Kuril Islands and Paramushiro Island.</p>
<p>The Alaska Highway, which is seventy feet wide and has a transportation capacity of tens of thousands of tons per month, is being utilized to the maximum extent. The enemy's base for operations in the North Pacific, Dutch Harbor, has stockpiles of military supplies piled up like mountains, which are gradually being transported to forward bases. In Dutch Harbor, Kodiak, Nome, Amchitka, Adak, Kiska, Attu, and other places, there are about one thousand aircraft, mainly heavy bombers, and the army includes about six divisions, including those in Alaska, and is also equipped with tanks, armored vehicles, parachute troops, etc. As for naval forces, according to reports from northern forward bases, there are two special-purpose aircraft carriers, two cruisers, and several destroyers and other vessels. On December 21st of last year, the U.S. Navy Department announced the appointment of Vice Admiral Frank Fletcher as the naval commander of the North Pacific area, from which it can also be inferred that a considerable fleet has been deployed in that area.</p>
<p>This route through the Aleutians was originally the operational base for the thorough bombing of the Japanese mainland, as stated by Alexander P. de Seversky, the leading American air power theorist: "Only Alaska or the Aleutians will do." Renowned military commentators also agreed with Seversky's opinion, saying: "The key to victory in the Pacific War lies in the North," advocating that jumping from island to island in the Central and South Pacific was extravagant, and they believed that this route was a "stepping stone to Japan" and had great expectations. Now is the preparatory period before the storm. In the 84th Diet session, Navy Minister Shimada said: "The defense of the North Pacific is becoming increasingly solid, and preparations for attack are also ready." Japan is also using this route as a stepping stone to the American continent, adopting a waiting and leaping posture.</p>
<p>Central Pacific</p>
<p>The four thousand five hundred soldiers under Major General Shibasaki, with their loyal blood, reddened the coral reefs of Tarawa and Makin Islands. More than a month after their heroic sacrifice, the enemy consumed two thousand nine hundred tons of steel and sacrificed tens of thousands of landing troops and more than twenty ships sunk at Tarawa and Makin Islands, forming an "undersea aircraft carrier fleet," giving the Japanese naval and air bases in the Marshall Islands, behind the Gilberts, an advantageous position for interior operations, and deploying a strong defensive line. This is also evident from the fact that the air battles over the Marshall Islands and the subsequent attacks by enemy aircraft on Mili Island, Maloelap Atoll, and Taroa Island were fiercely struck.</p>
<p>However, we cannot fail to note that the enemy's air force in this area has also completed its preparations. In the air battle over the Marshall Islands on December 5th, the enemy launched an attack with a mobile force mainly consisting of two aircraft carriers, using about one hundred carrier-based bombers and fighters to attack Japanese bases. The disadvantage of aircraft carriers intruding into the center of land-based air force spheres of influence has been a lesson learned since the start of the Greater East Asia War, especially in the air battles around the Gilbert and Bougainville Islands. However, the enemy still used aircraft carriers to launch attacks, which shows that the enemy's land-based bases in this area at that time did not have the ability to provide powerful air forces, and large aircraft with long-range endurance did not materialize.</p>
<p>However, ten days later, the enemy's attacks on the Marshall Islands were carried out by formations of twenty to thirty large Consolidated B-24 Liberator bombers, each with seven or eight crew members. This simultaneous operation of multiple large aircraft proves that the enemy's land-based air force has been strengthened. However, the enemy's current attacks on the Marshall Islands are less of a genuine offensive and more of a means to defend against Japanese bombing and replenish enemy forces. Regarding the enemy's objective in the central invasion route, enemy reports also say that it is "an operation to strike directly at the Japanese mainland via the South Seas," but in reality, after the Gilbert Islands are strengthened, the enemy will target the South Seas within Japan's strategic sphere and attempt a third offensive, forming a pincer attack with the South Pacific, so the war in this area should be closely guarded.

<h3>Free Movement of Rice Permitted Within the Joint Defense Area of Three Provinces and Two Cities: Rice Control Association Sends Letter to Authorities of Three Provinces and Two Cities</h3>
<p>Central News Agency: The Provisional Regulations for the Management of Rice Transportation and Sales in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui have been amended and passed by the Executive Yuan on November 25th of last year and promulgated for implementation. It is now heard that in order to alleviate the panic among the people regarding food supplies in rural and urban areas, the Association, based on the provisions of Article 5 of the regulations, yesterday sent separate letters to the governments of the three provinces, as well as the special municipalities of Nanjing and Shanghai, providing explanations and requesting them to notify their subordinates to inform the people to comply with the regulations. The gist is as follows: All citizens are allowed to freely move their harvested rice within the same village or from the village to the county seat. If the rice is not harvested by themselves, but is only for their own consumption within the same administrative area, then it is limited to within eight kilograms and can also be freely transported. However, there are separate regulations regarding the movement of rice within the Shanghai control line. All people outside the control line are allowed to handle it according to this.</p>
<h3>Air Defense Training Results Are Generally Satisfactory: Statement by the Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Headquarters</h3>
<p>Central News Agency: The air defense training period from the 13th to the 15th has ended, and the results are generally satisfactory. The authorities of the Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Headquarters have issued the following statement:</p>
<p>Although the training period was only two days, all sectors of the city were able to clearly recognize the current war situation and worked diligently throughout to achieve the expected objectives. The authorities are extremely satisfied. In modern warfare, cities are bound to be subjected to air raids. Recent air battles in Europe have shown that the extensive bombing has drawn the entire city's citizens into the vortex of war, even in rear areas. The citizens of this city, whether Chinese, Japanese, or foreigners, must unite as one, military, government, and civilians, to further strengthen the air defense posture in preparation for enemy attacks and to establish reliable countermeasures.</p>
<p>The results of this training are more satisfactory than last year, but judging from the actual situation of air-raided cities in modern times, there are still many shortcomings. We will now list the matters that require attention and have repeatedly warned about in the past, but there are still many areas that need to be improved. We express our regret on this point and hope that all citizens will pay more attention and immediately improve them without waiting for the next training session, so that they can cope with air raids at any time. Finally, we express our deep gratitude to all the citizens for their efforts.</p>
<h3>Matters Requiring Attention: Cooperation Among People of All Nationalities</h3>
<p>The results of several training sessions have been quite good, but due to language barriers among people of various nationalities, communication of meaning is difficult, resulting in incomplete cooperation. In the future, air defense terminology and various regulations and signals will be studied.</p>
<p>Thorough Implementation of Various Controls</p>
<p>Lighting Control: 1. Lighting control has not been good this time. Although no light leakage was seen from the ground, light leakage was still visible from aircraft or high-rise buildings, especially in the area south of the Suzhou Creek. This was mostly due to incomplete light shielding of windows and skylights on the back sides of bustling street-side buildings and residences. 2. On the first day of the invasion, the state of alert control at the start of training was extremely poor. In the future, preparations must be made within the time period for issuing control orders, and alerts should be issued at any time. 3. During lighting control, there was still light leakage due to lack of shielding, and during alert control, some cars were still driving without lights or with excessively bright lights. Improvements must be made in the future.</p>
<p>Sound and Traffic Control: Sound and traffic control were generally satisfactory, but Chinese pedestrians still continued to move about during air raid alarms. After the issuance of alert alarm orders, those without urgent matters should stop going out and wait quietly at home.</p>
<p>Handling of Multiple Places Bombed Simultaneously and High-Altitude Bombing: People in general, especially in office areas, are not enthusiastic. Very few people implement damage and evacuation drills, which is regrettable.</p>
<p>Raising Training Standards</p>
<p>There has been rapid progress compared to the last time, but there is still excessive noise and too many people at each training location, which reduces work efficiency. Instructors must direct subordinates to ensure smooth progress of work. Cooperation with neighboring autonomous groups is not close. There have been refusals to lend various tools, causing inconvenience. In the future, Baojia must have a spirit of mutual assistance and engage in more cooperation. In general, people other than air defense personnel are indifferent to air defense. Many people regard air defense work as a kind of drama and watch from the sidelines, which is inappropriate.</p>
<p>Various Comprehensive Training Exercises</p>
<p>During various training exercises, the command of the instructors is still not thorough enough, causing confusion. Therefore, the squad leader must consider the number of squad members and make appropriate commands. The progress of work at a simulated damage location is often mixed with other work, hindering the progress of other work. Instructors must weigh the importance and urgency of work, make judgments promptly, and take appropriate measures.</p>
<p>Wounded First Aid Method</p>
<p>Each unit can quickly use wound treatment methods, and bandaging techniques have been improved. However, no practical training has been conducted on hemostasis. Each unit can quickly handle the transportation of the injured, but the following matters require further study and practice:</p>
<p>1. Rescue commanders failed to thoroughly command the work, causing confusion and affecting fire and gas defense work. 2. The location for first aid work at the incident site should be based on the principle of not being affected by smoke, fire, or poisonous gas and not hindering other work. 3. The stretcher method should be rapid, and the injured should not be tied too roughly. The performance of the exercises in the Shanghai area was particularly good.</p>
<h3>High School Second-Year Students Applying for Scholarships to Register Today: Mr. Yang Fusheng Generously Donates 20,000 Yuan Yesterday</h3>

<h3>New Director of the Health Bureau, Yuan Junchang, Takes Office: Striving to Improve Future Health Administration</h3>
<p>The new Director of the Shanghai Special Municipality Health Bureau, Yuan Junchang, arrived at the Bureau to take office at 11:00 am yesterday (the 17th). Mr. Yuan is a native of Shangyu, Zhejiang. He holds a Doctorate in Medicine from the University of Paris, France, and has received a silver medal from the French Academy of Medical Research. He graduated from the Higher Institute of Hygiene of the University of Paris and the Faculty of Tropical Diseases of the University of Paris. He was a researcher at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. In 1929, he represented the Chinese Ministry of Education and the National Central Research Institute at the 13th International Congress of Physiology held in the United States. Upon returning to China in 1929, he was appointed as a technical expert and section chief at the Central Epidemic Prevention Office in Peiping, and as the director of the Nanjing Municipal Infectious Disease Hospital, concurrently serving as a lecturer at the Army Medical School of the Ministry of Military Administration. In 1935, he was appointed as a technical expert and section chief at the Forensic Research Institute of the Ministry of Judicial Administration, as well as a consultant physician at the Sacred Heart Hospital in Shanghai. He then served as the superintendent of the Shanghai Puci Sanatorium, concurrently serving as the director of the Department of Mental and Neurological Diseases. When the concessions were taken over last year, he served as the deputy director of the First and Eighth District Health Offices of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Issuing a Statement</p>
<p>After taking office, Director Yuan issued a statement to reporters, saying: "Health administration is closely related to public health and social welfare. The city has a vast area and a dense population, making public health particularly important. The city is currently divided into eight districts, and due to different historical backgrounds, there are variations in various health facilities, allowing for comparisons of advantages and disadvantages to improve. Due to funding and other reasons, it may not be possible to achieve our ideal goals at once, but within the realm of possibility, we will do our best to meet the expectations of the public. This is also our responsibility. Politics is not about talking too much, but about being realistic, seeking truth, and striving forward. We hope for the assistance of the press and the public, which would be very fortunate."</p>
<p>Yesterday's Publication Time: 7:05 PM</p>
<p>Economic Sector</p>
<h3>Commentary: Protection of Producers</h3>
<p>This year is a year of increased production, which is also a year of increasing the power of the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, we are not afraid of being repetitive and will say everything we believe is related to the issue of production. The National Economic Commission recently convened its third plenary committee meeting in Nanjing. The chairman personally wrote an instruction, stating that this year's economic construction should focus on increased production, with increased production of food and cotton being the priorities. In addition to agriculture, attention must also be paid to light industry, such as yarn and flour industries. This shows that if we do not talk about increased production, then the only targets for increased production are the people's clothing and food, because "securing the home front" is the only way to "repel foreign enemies," which is a winning principle.</p>
<p>Returning to the topic of increased production, we feel that one sentence in the chairman's instruction is particularly worthy of our support, which is: "The government should devote its full efforts to the protection of producers, ensuring that producers can enjoy the fruits of their production." What is the protection of producers? Everything that disturbs producers from the outside, such as the looting by the Communist bandits, the extortion by corrupt officials, and the exploitation by unscrupulous troops, must be prohibited. This is certainly one explanation. Another explanation is what this column said on the National Day last year in the discussion "Increasing Agricultural and Industrial Production," that the state must embody protection within its rewards for increased agricultural and industrial production. The methods are as follows: 1. Pay special attention to guaranteeing the income of agricultural producers to encourage their reproduction. 2. Pay special attention to the advancement of labor welfare undertakings to ensure the livelihood of workers. 3. Support legitimate private business organizations to encourage their production of daily necessities for the people.</p>

<h3>Japanese Embassy Office Holds　Government-Private Discussion Meeting　Ambassador Tani Delivers Instructions</h3>
<p>Central News Agency: The Greater East Asia War has entered its third year. In order to strengthen the promotion and procurement of important materials production in Central China, the Shanghai Japanese Embassy Office took advantage of Ambassador Tani's visit to Shanghai and held a government-private discussion meeting at the Japan Club yesterday (17th) afternoon at 2:00 PM. Attendees from the Japanese military included Army Minister Nagatsu, Naval Attaché Kondo, Head of the Military Police Kinoshita. From the Nanjing Embassy, there were Ambassador Tani, Counselor Kishi, Secretary O, Investigator Honda, and Military Attachés Ozawa and Koshiba. From the Shanghai Embassy Office, there were Minister Tajiri, Counselors Okuda and Okazaki, Investigators Mifune and Yamada, and Secretaries Okumura, Masuda, and Hirota.

The content of the discussion and a summary of Ambassador Tani's instructions are as follows:</p>
<p>Discussion Content</p>
<p>Strengthen government-private liaison to make the relationship between the embassy, which is in a guiding position, and the business community, which is responsible for actual operations, closer. If the embassy has any shortcomings in its affairs or other aspects, the business community should actively offer opinions. The embassy will also make its best efforts to handle matters quickly. Those in charge of each industry should personally direct and enhance production and promote procurement. Those in charge of each industry should take the lead in personally directing to thoroughly convey the new Sino-Japanese relationship to subordinate organizations. Prioritize the allocation of human resources and make efforts to allocate human resources to important departments. Utilize material resources. In order to utilize raw materials, each industry should strengthen coordination, share resources, and use limited materials to achieve maximum results. This should also apply to technical issues.</p>
<p>Ambassador Tani's Speech: Total War, Forge Ahead Courageously</p>
<p>In brief: The scope of this world war and the intensity of the fighting are unprecedented in history. The world's major countries are divided into two camps: either ours or the enemy's, and a decisive battle is underway. In this war, there is no room for compromise to decide the fate of the nation. There is only victory or annihilation. The Greater East Asia War waged by Japan is also such a decisive battle to determine the fate of our Yamato people. Judging from past battles, the ambitions of Britain and the United States are increasingly exposed. However, whenever our Yamato people encountered national crises in the past, they relied on promoting the essence of unity to overcome all difficulties and prosper the nation. This is what history has shown since the founding of the country. Therefore, the people of the whole country, whether on the front lines or in the rear, should exert their total strength until the enemy kneels down. The war we need ahead is a war in which the whole country exerts its strength. Although the soldiers on the front lines are good at planning and fighting bravely, if even one person in the rear does not perform their duties, the Greater East Asia War cannot be won. In particular, this year is the third year of the decisive battle of the Greater East Asia War, which is the most important year. Victory or defeat depends on this year. If the people recognize the situation and bravely forge ahead, then a glorious victory will undoubtedly be ours.</p>
<p>Sino-Japanese Relations Enter a New Stage</p>
<p>On January 9th of last year, the National Government announced its participation in the war, and the relationship between China and Japan entered a close stage of shared life and death. In order to adapt to this new relationship, the Japanese government decided on a fundamental policy of a new policy towards China. Recently, it has been implemented based on the new policy. The so-called new policy is to respect the self-determination and responsibility of the National Government, vigorously promote its autonomous activities, and strengthen the guiding force of the National Government. For example, returning concessions, returning the Beijing Embassy area, abolishing taxation rights, handling enemy property, adjusting Sino-Japanese joint venture companies, and strengthening the Commercial Control Association and its subordinate institutions are all concrete manifestations of the new policy. The so-called new policy is not a new policy. It is to implement the policies that Japan has wanted to implement for many years but could not due to external obstacles. The new policy is a manifestation of the original relationship between China and Japan, and it is also a measure that Japan should take. The promotion of Japan's fundamental policy towards China has further led to the conclusion of a treaty of alliance to replace the old basic treaty, and the announcement of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese Incident in China, six years have passed. During this period, various incidents have been caused in order to carry out war actions. Therefore, the current situation is still quite different from Japan's goals. However, restoring the relationship between China and Japan to the normal relationship revealed by the treaty of alliance and the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration is our major mission in the third year of the decisive battle. The establishment of a normal Sino-Japanese relationship is the beginning of a new order in Greater East Asia. The completion of the new order in East Asia will enable the empire to survive and defend itself.</p>
<p>Work Hard to Establish Friendly Relations</p>
<p>At the same time, East Asia will also be stable, which is by no means an exaggeration. Judging from the pure mistakes of the Moscow Conference and the Cairo Conference, the Sino-Japanese Incident is entirely a link in the world war. Our opponent is by no means a warlord or politician in Chongqing, but the hearts of 400 million Chinese people. The warlords and politicians in Chongqing ignore Japan's fair policies and follow Britain and the United States, and the distance between them and the Chinese people who wholeheartedly remember China is even greater. The Greater East Asia War has entered its third year, and the domestic systems in Japan are becoming more complete, and the morale of the people is rising. We, the compatriots in China, should reflect on whether the allocation of our occupations and the business of our businesses can conform to the domestic system? Can we reach the point of Sino-Japanese co-existence and co-prosperity? I hope that my compatriots in China will entrust as much work and affairs as possible to Chinese people in order to conform to the domestic labor mobilization plan. Today, all of you present are advanced people who are working hard in various aspects of the business community. If you allow me to express my opinions frankly, you will all agree that Shanghai has always been the place with the strongest British and American influence. Although the Shanghai concessions have been recovered and enemy property is being gradually disposed of, it is not easy to eliminate the British and Americans in the hearts of the Chinese people. I have heard a certain important person in China say that Shanghai people are a unique race different from Chinese people. You are in contact with Chinese people in a unique atmosphere every day, and I believe you are working very hard. Your efforts to establish friendly Sino-Japanese relations can be said to be effective. I would like to take this opportunity to hope that you will earnestly implement the following three points: (1) Actively cooperate to enhance combat power; (2) Implement Sino-Japanese economic cooperation based on mutual benefit; (3) Practice the spirit of morality.</p>
<p>Certificates for inoculation used in this city can be obtained from any health sub-office mentioned above. Certificates for inoculation required for leaving Shanghai are only issued by the health sub-office at 340 Hankou Road. Business firms, factories or other organizations that want to request personnel to go to the firms or organizations to inoculate their employees can submit a written request to the director of the health department of this office. However, all the said firms or organizations must be located within this district and must have 100 or more employees inoculated at the same time. In addition, a fee of two yuan per person must be paid, plus the round-trip fare of the inoculation vehicle dispatched by this office, calculated at 20 yuan per mile. The total amount used will be invoiced by this office to the firms after the event. Groups that want to apply for vaccine seedlings and ask their own doctors to inoculate can apply to the nearest health sub-office in writing through the registered doctor. This is hereby announced for general information. October 2, 32nd year of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Special Municipality Grain Bureau　Notice　Grain Secret No. 232</h3>

<h3>Order at the North Station Needs Thorough Improvement</h3>
<p>-- Shan Cuo</p>
<p>The long-troubled order at the North Station, since the Chinese and Japanese authorities decided to abolish the universal inspection of passengers from January 1st, the entrance and exit gates have been slightly more convenient. However, due to the large number of passengers inside and outside the station, the crowded situation is still common, and there are frequent reports of injuries to women, children, the elderly. In addition, train tickets are not easy to obtain, and such things still cannot thoroughly relieve the suffering of passengers. On the one hand, it is due to the large-scale activities of unlicensed vendors; on the other hand, the railway system needs to be improved, which is undeniable. I secretly hope that the Huazhong Railway Company authorities can further implement improvements. The methods are simple and feasible, and the benefits to passengers are great. Therefore, I will list them as follows based on my limited observations:</p>
<p>(1) Restore the South Station and change the South-bound Shanghai-Hangzhou trains to depart from the South Station, so that passengers traveling along the coastal Hangzhou line can enter and exit from the South Station, which can reduce the congestion at the North Station by at least one-third or more. Otherwise, another station can be opened nearby, such as Tiantong'an Station.</p>
<p>(2) After passengers enter the North Station, they still have to wait until one quarter of an hour before departure before checking their tickets and boarding the train, causing passengers to line up and wait, resulting in the station still being crowded and difficult to buy tickets. The authorities are considering removing the ticket office in the station to accommodate it. In fact, it is only necessary to restore the ticket checking system to the pre-war method, changing it to check the tickets as soon as they arrive, so that passengers can go directly to the platform to board the train and accommodate it on the train. Since the train has already been at the station when it departs from the North Station, there is no inconvenience. On the one hand, the passengers in the station will no longer be crowded, and the order will be well-maintained.</p>
<p>(3) Increase the number of trains and vehicles. The current passenger trains are extremely crowded and lack order and hygiene. It is hoped that the Huazhong Railway authorities can increase the number of trains. For example, after the train departs at 12:00 noon, there is no military departure until 4:00 PM in the afternoon. In the four hours in between, the number of trains can be increased. If not, then first increase the number of trailers. The method is to detach them station by station. For example, the last two carriages are detached at Suzhou Station to stay in Suzhou, and the next two carriages are detached at Wuxi Station to stay in Wuxi, etc. When returning, they are added station by station. In this way, it can not only make passengers convenient and comfortable, but also achieve the goal of coal economy. (Moved to help students)</p>
<h3>Navy: Ambition (7)</h3>
<p>-- Written by Iwata Toyoo, translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>Actually speaking, the Sino-British War, although it was a fierce war, was still inevitable to have negligence. For example, the watermelon boat plan is a good example. This was an organization of more than eighty daredevils initiated by Narahara, who killed the British. They were divided into seven watermelon boats, all disguised as merchants, with a knife hidden in their breasts. They boarded the British warship and killed the British. At the same time, they fired artillery from the straits, and both sides sank to the bottom of the sea. At first glance, it seems like a famous case, but most Europeans and Americans do not like watermelons very much, so they have no reason to buy so many watermelons. Moreover, although the daredevils thought they were disguised as merchants, their eyes were piercing and they had knives hidden in their waists. The British warships would naturally be on guard. Although this plan ultimately failed, among the team members were the later Marshal Oyama, and especially Marshal Saigo Tsugumichi and General Nirei Kagenori, who had a very deep relationship with the Japanese Navy, which cannot be forgotten. Moreover, Marshal Togo, who was only seventeen years old, also went on his first expedition in this battle, and his firm belief that he must defend against the enemy from the sea on the sea became a famous saying.</p>
<p>The formal start of the war was at noon on July 2nd, in the midst of a rainstorm. From the beginning, whenever a foreign ship came to Kagoshima, there was always a rainstorm. This time was no exception. In the wind and rain, the soldiers took off their clothes and fired the first shot from the Tenpozan battery in the south. This was the signal gun for the start of the war, and each battery continued to fire. It was just like the unforgettable dawn of December 8th, when the giant guns were fired at the British ship "Petrel" in Shanghai.</p>
<p>There is also one thing similar to this war, that is, the British side mistakenly believed that Japan had no intention of fighting. It was just an offensive taken for intimidation, and not actually preparing for war. At this time, the batteries fired deadly shots, so they did not know what to do for a while. The Basas even hurriedly cut off the anchor cable and fled. It is a great shame for the navy of any country to abandon its anchor and flee. The flagship "Julius" hurriedly sailed to a location about half a mile away from the coast and began shelling, but there was a place for practice targets, so accurate shells were fired from the Satsuma battery. Although it was an old-fashioned round shell, three shells hit the British warship directly, and the deck was destroyed, and the captain and vice-captain were injured on the spot.</p>
<p>The damage to the Satsuma side was also considerable. The range of the Satsuma cannons was only two miles, while the range of the enemy's naval guns could reach seven miles. Moreover, the total number of Satsuma cannons was eighty-nine, while the British warships had one hundred and one. The Gionzhou battery was the most damaged. The cannons were bent like soft candy, and the cannon mounts had been destroyed and were unusable. However, the morale was not diminished at all. In the wind and rain, the command drum rang through the sky. The young drummer at that time was the later Marshal Ito. (2) (10) (7)</p>

<h3>Beware of New-Style Pickpockets</h3>
<p>Recently, there has been a group of new pickpockets, about fourteen or fifteen years old, disguised as garbage collectors. Their clothes are not too shabby, so they are not noticed even if they get close to pedestrians. They mix among the crowds at tram stations and other places with many pedestrians, using garbage tongs made of lead money to pick up handkerchiefs, gloves, etc. that are exposed in the pockets of pedestrians' coats or long gowns, and the victims are completely unaware. I would like to advise people from all walks of life to be careful to avoid losses. (Hong)</p>
