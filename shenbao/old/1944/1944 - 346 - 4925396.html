<h3>縱貫鐵道實現　已指日可待　未敷軌區僅八百公里</h3>
<p>東京十五日中央社電　由東京經大陸直達安南·泰國·緬甸·馬來之陸上連絡路途，以性質言之，本早應實現，如在帝俄以迄蘇聯赤軍之過程中，曾設一大橫斷鐵路，以聯絡荒蕪寂寞之西伯利亞及不見人之土耳其斯坦，而今日人口稠密，物資流動之東亞各國間，獨無一條縱貫鐵路，實係奇事。而此奇事促成之重要理由，大體可分以下三項：第一，亞細亞未能大問題結，亞細亞迄今曾因非亞細亞勢力，而分成數勢力圈或殖民地，此種性質各異之地繋·組織，全係彼此排斥互相出入之地區，無論安南·馬來以及緬甸，決不令他國資本輸人自國，而中國大陸縱貫鐵路，又皆爲非亞細亞勢力之吸血管。蓋斯乃由非亞細亞勢力所敷設者，故雖表面屬於中國，而實非中國自身所有，鐵路之監理運營，亦受非亞細亞勢力之支配，因此，有關於亞細亞自身之連絡事項等，均不得如意實施。第二，今亞洲民族中爲謀各族繁榮，而且在資本技術各方面，能有自力建設能力者，惟日本一國而已。第三，當舉英美法等利益之獨占事業，其中尤以英國之海運野慾爲甚，如「怡和洋行」乃係代表英國於東亞統理海運業者，彼欲以海路獨占東亞物資之運輸，故曾以全力阻止大陸縱貫榆途路途之實現，然而中國腹地至海港之大陸橫斷鐵路，固與彼等之利益一致，故乃猛力援助建設。因有以上之主要原因，故亞細亞大陸之縱貫鐵路，自無實現之可能，因之日本特舉全力，以謀此種不合理情勢之解決，自大東亞戰爭以來，因日軍軍事上之成功，於大陸縱貫鐵道之實現，巳指日可待。現在東京·昭南間鐵道之未敷設地區，係桂林與柳州及西貢與布裕塞二區，其間之距離，僅八百三十公里，日軍若掃除漢口·長沙·桂林間之鐵道沿綫殘餘的渝軍，則殘留者僅資本·資材·拔術問題而巳，至此完成亞細亞縱貫鐵道之難題，當迎刃而解矣。</p>
<h3>日閣議決定　明年度預算</h3>
<p>東京十五日中央社電　日政府十五日下午三時在首相官邸舉行臨時閣議，小磯首相以下各閣僚均出席，議決昭和二十年度歲出追加概算，及　昔決定之基準概算，并決定昭和二十年度歲入歲出概算，四時許散會。</p>
<h3>日收回白金　成績極佳</h3>
<p>東京十五日中央社電　日本全國各地，過去三日間曾展開新兵器必需之白金收回運動，得國民熱誠協力，至本月十二日，全國收回之實數，竟達目標量百分之二百三十以上，且此項白金已製成新兵器，輸往前綫。</p>
<h3>東京特約通信之三　雷伊泰攻防戰</h3>
<p>— 俊之</p>
<p>十月十八日美運輸船團侵入雷伊泰灣，砲擊沿岸，至同月二十日，麥克沃塞麾下的陸軍，即在海空雙方的掩護下，以塔克羅班及特勒格爲中心，開始在雷伊泰島强行登陸。其上陸部隊的主力，似爲瑪志齊少將的騎兵第一師團及巴恩莫狄思少將的第二十四師團。他們從塔克羅班在雷伊泰峽谷的右面沿卡里加拉灣西進；同時，以第七師團及第九十六師團等爲中心的一隊，則在雷伊泰峽谷左面由特勒格向奧爾莫克挺進。其作戰計畫顯然企圖迴避密林和峽谷，由南北二路夾擊，以期將日軍驅入奧爾莫克海中。</p>
<p>爭奪制空權</p>
<p>上陸當初，美軍憑恃巨砲和炸彈的威力，起卸了不少戰車和重砲等，奪得塔克羅班和特勒格附近的飛行塲，加緊修復後，即以該處爲基地，力圖增加航空兵力，以謀取得制空權。但該島守軍以寡敵衆，巧妙整理戰綫，固守達加米高地及其他沿峽谷的主要高地，踞高臨下，俯擊美軍，不時派遣肉搏衝鋒隊奇襲，衝入敵軍背後，使其大軍混亂。因此，自卡里加拉至奧爾莫克的一帶高地，悉在日軍手中，而美軍所保有的陣地，不過沿海岸一帶的狹小平地而已。</p>
<p>雷伊泰島攻防戰的作戰方略，日美雙方大致相同，即第一步在於爭奪該方面的制空權，然後切斷對方的海上補給綫，使其地上部隊無法取得給養，並阻其增援。因此，自從美軍開始雷伊泰島登陸戰以來，該方面的空戰戰况，即日益劇烈，雙方都不肯放鬆，頗有相持不下的形勢。在這一月餘的期間內，日軍本其卓越的傳統精神，陸續派遣舉世無雙的神風特別攻擊隊，猛攻美方的艦隊及運輸船團，樹下不少光榮的戰績。可是，美軍雖然連連受到嚴重的打擊，却也不肯甘休，不斷從新幾內亞方面抽調生力空軍，以期和日本航空部隊爭一日之長；同時，其運輸船團和海上部隊，也冒着日方的猛烈反攻，拚死掙扎，設法將增援的軍隊及武器起卸上岸。</p>
<p>實行果敢奇襲</p>
<p>正如日本小磯首相所說，雷伊泰島攻防戰是太平洋上決戰的關鍵，美軍既不惜鉅大犧牲圖謀一逞，日軍當然也本所謂必死必殺的神風精神，誓必擊潰敵人，所以一方面源源派遣大軍增援，另一方面又在前綫實行果敢的奇襲，除出派遣敢死隊衝鋒肉搏以外，復於十一月二十六日夜由陸軍中尉中重男率領陸軍特別攻擊隊黨空挺隊，分乘運輸機四架，在特勒格及布羅音美軍飛行塲附近降落，御入兩飛行塲的要部，予以嚴重的破壞。其後，布羅音西方地區的日軍於十二月六日晨攻入美軍陣綫，向飛行塲挺進。同日夜，高千穗降下部隊分頭在布羅音·聖巴布羅·特勒格·塔克羅班各美軍手中的飛行塲降陸。奇襲布羅音的支隊與進攻該處的地上部隊取得連絡後，當即佔領機塲，而其他各處的高千穗部隊，也建立偉勳，美軍費了九牛二虎之力建立起來的橋頭堡，因而全部陷於混亂狀態中。爲了挽回頹勢，振作士氣，七日晨美軍又在雷伊泰島奧爾莫克東南約八公里的阿爾別拉附近地點上陸約一個師團的援軍，日軍一面在地上迎頭邀擊，到處攔截，予以重大損害，一面又出動空軍，猛烈轟炸其上陸地點及後續船團，擊沉擊毀其艦船多艘·十日，在雷伊泰島東南斯利加渥海峽方面，日丹心特攻隊冒着强烈的防禦砲火，炸沉大型運輸船二艘·巡洋艦或大型驅逐艦一艘·大型上陸用舟艇二艘，擊毀大型運輸船一艘，並使巡洋艦或大型驅逐艦一艘起火。</p>
<p>美方損失重大</p>
<p>自從　空挺隊及高千穗部隊奇襲雷伊泰島美軍機塲，及日軍地上部隊展開攻勢以來，該方面的均衡狀態即告打破，雷伊泰島美軍的基地航空兵力，頓形弱化，現在該島美軍所能應用的飛行塲，僅有塔克羅班·特勒格及最近新設的塔瑙溫三處，而這些飛行塲也因日軍的强行降陸及日機的連續轟炸，弄得千瘡百孔，除供少數小型飛機昇降以外，大型飛機是無法使用的。關於這種情形，甚至美方自己的無綫電廣播也承認：「最近菲島的日本空軍勢力非常强化，由於日本特攻隊的攻擊，我方的損害亦甚重大」（寄自東京）</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>論食米對策</h3>
<p>昨天本市市政諮詢委員會，市商會，以及商統會等數機關主腦人物，招待前此本市新聞記者產米區視察團諸君，一方面表示慰勞，一方面根據該團發表的報告書中關於農村經濟，農作生產，以及收買米糧工作諸問題，交換意見，並商討更完善的建議方案。可是，恰巧在招待之時，本市米價正瘋狂暴漲。因爲招待席上，同座有市政當局，商統會當局，米統會當局，米業領袖，也可以說對於米糧都有相當責任，所以討論上海民食問題，格外顯得深切的關心。</p>
<p>我們始終認爲上海米價（指配給米公定價以外）的暴漲是不合理的，是人爲的。換句話說，因爲政府對於米價的管理不嚴密，一般奸商趁火打刧的行爲所造成的。我們根據昨天招待席上諸位的意見，綜合本報一貫的主張，貢獻意見如次：</p>
<p>第一，我們早已指出過，上海是謠言的製造地，無中生有以及捕風捉影的謠言特別的多。奸商市儈製造謠言，以追求暴利爲目的。所以，每次物價漲風的前夕，必有謠言；反之，謠言謠起之後，就是物價暴漲。謠言是因，漲風是果。例如最近黃金的暴漲，股票的驟起驟落，莫不是奸商的作祟。這次米價的瘋狂，同此一例，而結果謠言畢竟是謠言，不攻自破，可是，物價却漲後不回，充其量也不過大漲小回。而一般人輕信謠言，吃了謠言的虧，仍不覺悟，下次的謠言仍然信以爲眞，這是很遺憾的。這次米價暴漲，由於米販隨口亂喊亂抬的結果，米販背後當然有奸商背景作支持，奸商就是囤米的蠢虫。我們主張一方面市民應鎭靜，一方面當局應嚴密管理配給米以外的米價。同時查究凡是造謠企圖暴利，造謠抬高米價者，應處以最嚴厲的罪刑。並以獎勵方法鼓勵市民檢舉。</p>
<p>第二，目前緊急處理的對策，爲制止奸商謠言起見，（一）戶口米提前配給一次或兩次，譬如應該十日配給的，提前於五日配給。（二）對於軍警公敎人員，勞動者，薪水階級等，特別增加一次雜糧配給。本來我們主張配給制度應採取重點主義，這是在重點配給制度未實施前的補救辦法，也即是使薪水階級及勞動者不致受奸商抬高米價的影響。因爲薪水階級及勞動者不受奸商抬價的影響，黑市就不會發生社會不安寗的作用了。</p>
<p>第三，上述的緊急對策是治標，至於治本辦法，（一）我們必須强調從速實施重點主義的配給制度。（二）軍警公敎人員，勞動者，薪水階級等，配給量必須足額。但不一定純米，雜糧也可。因爲戰時產米有限，大家應打破非吃米不可的觀念，提倡搭吃雜糧。（三）富有者，暴利者，不但不必收受配給來，而必須担負爲彼工作的人給養的義務。舉例言之，富有者雇用的秘書書記帳房工役等，或私人商店工廠有盈利者，所雇用的夥計工人，都須爲之担負一部分食米。實施時根據保甲調查，期達嚴密準確。同時，嚴格規定，凡在決定重點配給時，保甲作弊故作不準確調查者，或公務人員作弊者，都應受社會輿論的制裁，及國家法律的懲罰。（四）切實增加農作物增產，過去的增產運動徒有其表，動用了很鉅的經費，都是白費的，農民本身受不到實惠。即宣傳工作也不過在城市中鼓吹，農村農民根本不知其事。我們希望今後增產經費能給予農民實惠，譬如肥料農具貨欵等等，不被合作社或鄉保甲長中飽吞沒。例如上海有咨力者或銀行等不以囤貨投機爲業務，直接貸欵農民，使不受高利貨的痛苦。總之，應由政府與民間推行切實可行的增產計劃，使下年度確保增產的實績。</p>
<p>第四，疏通米源，不論治標治本都有迫切需要。這個責任，米統會當然是責無旁貨。現在米統會當局對於過去失敗經騐，固然認清，一切在逐步改進，對於不稱職的職員，也在逐漸淘汰中，同時，對於民間輿論也能接受，即如招待本市記者視察產米區，更爲一種具體表示。我們希望更進一步，民間必須認清大局，目前正在戰時。同時，米統會更應充分接受民間輿論，在雙方兼顧之下，使米源一天天的增加。</p>
<p>最後，米糧問題在目前固極嚴重，可是，決不是徒喚奈何或離開現實可期解決的。我們盼望有關當局，社會領袖，開誠研討實施實事求是的切實對策，俾逐漸減少其嚴重性。</p>
<p>浚懇尹山湖　展開初步工作　決在蘇成立辦事處</p>
<p>南京十五日中央社電　前建設部水利增產設計委員會，於去歲曾　定四項水利增產計劃：（一）東太湖浚懇計劃，（二）尹山湖浚懇計劃，（三）芙蓉圩挑水及灌溉工程，（四）完成華陽閘工程。爲期次第興辦，於本年先成立東太湖浚懇工程局。嗣因該局人事未臻建全，施工措置失當，至於工程進行，遭受重大損失，現巳陷於停頓狀態。茲前建部以水利建設乃屬當前急需，故利用目前適合於尹山湖浚懇工程進行之良好時機，開始該方面之浚懇工程。建部爲此早經着手各項施工準備，刻下所需經費，與工人食糧，經建部與關係方面之連絡，業已粗有眉目。決定於期內在蘇州成立尹山湖浚懇工程施工辦事處，聞處長人選，將由傅部長自兼，並即日召租抽水機船四十艘。同時水利處之全體技術人員，亦將前往工地，展開初步工作。</p>

<p>北平十五日中央社電　綏靖總署宣導局長趙晋三少將，爲加强駐各地華北綏靖軍之宣撫工作，特於昨晨重赴永靖，視察綏靖軍第七集團軍。</p>
<h3>大東亞博物館　設準備委會</h3>
<p>東京十五日中央社電　日文部省決定設置大東亞博物館設立準備委員會，十五日公布內部綱要，大東亞博物館爲達到此次戰爭之目的，實現大東亞宣言，以最有效而切實之方途蒐　有關大東亞諸地域之天然資源，政治，經濟，文化，民族，產業等各種資料，加以調查研究收集其結果以綜合展覽，此項建設，在朝野權威慎重商榷之企劃下，有實現整備充實之必要，故此次綱羅各關係官及各界權威者，成立準備委員會，該會設會長一名，文部大臣兼任，委員五十名以內，幹事若干名。</p>
<h3>「泥濘與高空」　美雜誌論雷伊泰戰局　到處遭日軍意外反擊</h3>
<p>瑞典京城十五日中央社電　美國泰晤士雜誌十二月四日載太平洋戰况，以「泥濘與高空」爲題，論雷伊泰島作戰如次：雷伊泰島作戰至少仍須兩月以上之時，自入熱帶雨季後，戰局已完全陷入泥濘中之膠着狀態。美軍目下之作戰，較雷伊泰登陸時，其進展已遲緩，故進攻呂宋已成夢想。雷伊泰距離馬尼刺雖僅三百哩，但美軍企圖除夕以前至馬尼刺之希望，巳早化爲泡影。麥克沃塞麾下之幕僚毫無常識，入於十二月後，雷伊泰泥渣中困難之作戰，彼等毫不考慮，菲律賓島道路已爲困難，新兵器之重壓下，必將完全毀壞，美軍繪製之雷伊泰島地圖，更出乎意料之簡單，故到處遭受日軍意外之反擊，因之日軍仍於菲律賓集結相當多數空軍，美海軍不得不予以警戒。</p>

<h3>華北資源與華北開發　（一）</h3>
<p>— 武公</p>
<p>（一）續言</p>
<p>記者此次奉派赴華北考察經濟，前後在故都滯留有二月餘，此行所獲印象殊深，尤其使我感到者就是立國於這個時代，如會經濟即毫無政治可言。過去所重視的領土完整，行政完整，這只是說出了主權在政治的一面。此外如資源的完整，物資管理的完整，則可說是一國主權在經濟的一面。由於戰爭的啓示，毫無疑義地，後者將尤重於前者。兩國的關係不論怎樣講得好聽，單是注重在政治上之互尊其主權，終不敵在經濟上互尊其主權之爲愈。一個國家如果在經濟上失去了它的主權，這個國家便興亡國無異。同時一個强國，也決不至愚蠢到只想佔領他國的土地，而不思　斷其物資。爲調和强國與弱國的關係起見，因此在國際上有所謂經濟合作一辭產生。然而國際的經濟合作，如果應當完全捐棄一切侵略的企圖，它必須是以平等爲基礎的互助與協力。</p>
<p>我國現在與盟邦日本是處於同生共死的戰友關係中，自然歷來所講的經濟合作應將顯見其重要。由於這一層關係，爲確立建設共榮戰力基礎起見，盟邦遂呼續着以中日滿爲一體的綜合計劃經濟。這種綜合計劃經濟，顯然已越過了經濟合作原有的姿態，其唯一主要的目標乃在完成勝利與建設。在這個情况中，記者此次北行視察經濟，當然首應重視的便是華北現有的資源與負責開發此種資源的機關。我國自兵　以還，首圖政治的復興，其中限於人力已稱不易，因此對經濟的復興乃大部依賴盟邦之協力。雖然在這種協力姿態上，緣於一時特殊的發展，未能盡合理想，然由是得以使國人認識其國防資源之重要，亦未始非一絕好的敎訓</p>
<p>講到華北經濟開發，我們首應注意的便是在中日滿構成一體的綜合計劃中，華北蒙疆與日滿兩國之一體化，實爲東亞防衛力之根幹。換言之，華北對於今後決戰最後階段中所負結成此項一體化作戰主力的經濟使命是極其重大的。在這個地域之內，構成國防資源的有五項：即煤，鐵，　，　土頁岩與棉花是。可以照盟邦人士的說法，華北經濟建設之成敗，即大東亞戰爭之勝敗！</p>
<p>（二）華北的國防資源</p>
<p>現在讓記者先來把華北五項國防資源的現况約略地說一說。第一是構成國力標準的煤，在華北的埋藏量，約當全中國埋藏量之80％，約佔一千三百億噸。據最近數字來看，恐還要增加。就是拿民國二十三年全中國煤的生產量來看，也佔着83％。而且華北的煤，一方面固然有優惠的自然環境，另一方面又因有盟邦優秀的機械設備與技術指導，此後的生產率必當有飛躍的進展。所謂優惠的自然環境，即炭層極厚，距離地表近，坑內煤氣很少，雖裸火亦能作業，且湧水量極少，而地盤强固，坑木之使用量亦微。因之，開發所需的資金與資材，只要有他處三分之一即可足用。同時炭質由褐炭到高度瀝清炭，其式樣不一，利用範圍極廣。尤其是製鐵用原料炭所不可缺的强粘結性瀝青炭，華北蘊藏極富。再者華北的煤，拿它來做人造石油的原料炭也具有適當的條件，於此可知對今後建設的重要了。</p>
<p>再說鐵，華北的埋藏量，可推定在三億噸以上。其中尤以蒙疆的龍烟最爲豐富，其埋藏量佔華北總數三分之二。其次山東的金嶺鎭，亦極有關，據說可採量達六百萬噸至一億噸以上。此外山西全省，尙有所謂芋狀等埋藏，但迄今尙未能成爲計劃的大量採掘。在製鐵之時，大概生產鐵銅一瓦噸，約需三瓦噸煤，故華北既富有藏煤量，對其今後重工業的發展性，實有莫大的期待。</p>
<p>鹽的重要，不在用做食料，而是因爲不論對曹達工業，染料工業及其它所謂鹽基性化學工業之原料，它都成爲必需的物件。尤其是化學兵器的資材，其需要鹽的程度更屬驚人。因此，鹽也成爲華北重要的國防資源之一。華北本有池鹽，并鹽以及岩鹽，不過目前當做工業鹽所開發的是海鹽。渤海沿岸的長蘆及山東一帶便是主要的產地。從來製鹽法有二：（一）煎熬法，如日本，（二）天日製鹽法，便是華北今日的現狀。這後者最優的條件，乃在於實際蒸發量非常大。所以今日華北長蘆鹽田廣達一六〇〇糎，青島鹽場亦達八一六糎，如與日本廣島鹽田（三一三糎）或華中的海州（四〇〇糎）相較，實不啻小巫見大巫。</p>
<p>礬土頁岩，每爲一般人所忽視，實乃近代軍需原料極重要之一環。因爲礬土頁岩含有鋁質，是以在製鋁工業之上負有異常重大的使命。華北所發見的鋁原鑛之礬土頁岩，據說冀東之開　煤鑛地區，其埋藏量就可推定爲四億噸。尤其含有鋁質在百分之六十以上者最多，此外山東之淄川·博山·章邱等各煤鑛地區，其埋藏量亦有十四億噸。</p>
<p>最後一項國防資源，便是棉花。本來棉花是熱帶性產物，不過溫帶的華北也含有許多好條件。華北在春季後氣溫立即上升，夏季特別具有尙溫，此是棉作的第一條件，其次晴多雨少，且在六七八三個月中較多降水量，也是好條件。雖然華北的黃土缺乏　素分，但只要加上水與硫安肥料，棉產較食糧亦更爲有　。因此，棉產將成爲今後華北農產之大宗，目前常以一千萬担之產量爲目標而邁進。（未完）</p>

<h3>英艦隊實力脆弱　將蹈美軍覆轍　松島部長發表談話</h3>
<p>盟邦駐華艦隊報道部，昨日下午二時，循例舉行報道常會，接見中國新聞記者，由松島部長報告太平洋菲島戰局，雷伊泰島爭奪戰情形。茲分誌於左：</p>
<p>菲島戰局</p>
<p>太平洋方面雷伊泰島之爭奪戰，日見緊張，敵美在雷伊泰島增援，擬進攻奧爾莫克，我方陸軍部隊予以極大打擊，雷伊泰島沿岸已有相當激戰。敵美以補給路綫過長，對物資供給，深感困難，尤其在雷島東岸所有飛機塲，均遭我方陸軍飛機之重大打擊。據最近確息，敵美對兵力之補給頗爲亟切且更重要，當運輸船冒險運送時，在旁竟不遣航空母艦護送，其損害顯見慘重。又英國弗拉塞提督所指揮之艦隊，現已變成太平洋艦隊，其原因：一因美國太平洋艦隊在菲島遭受極大損害，兵力薄弱。二因英國擬爭取戰後之發言　，但英羣毫無實力，不足一擊。觀於英艦隊於擊沉德國特比茨戰艦後，始能開到太平洋，德國以一隻戰艦，即可牽制英國之艦隊，足徵英國艦隊脆弱無力矣。結果美海軍失敗後，由英海軍繼續，但英國航空力量薄弱，無力作戰，仍不免蹈失敗覆轍。將來英美合作，困難甚多，在太平洋方面對日作戰，必失敗無疑，尤其彼等補給基地尤爲困難。英國雖宣稱有澳洲之雪梨與墨爾缽二處爲補給基地，但該二處距作戰區極遠，而農產物之運輸困難尤甚。故此次英國組織太平洋艦隊，造成英美兩國之複雜情形，對於英美有害無利，可說英國無非爲保護其過去現在及將來在太平洋上之權利而巳。</p>
<p>京行觀感</p>
<p>本人此次到南京，見一般青年對愛國極具熱誠，殊堪欽佩，倘有良好指導者及保護者，彼等對改變中國之命運，當有極大之貢獻。過鎭江時黃秀谷縣長率領幹部人員來聽余對時局之講演，可見彼等對於時局之關切。近聞有中國要人將獻機數架之說。對空襲情形中國人之思想，近亦有改變，已認識非重慶之飛機，乃爲美國之飛機，故對之均抱極大反感。尤其最近對於漢口之轟炸，完全破壞中國人民之生命財產，美國制　東亞之野心，顯然可見。尤其對於長沙之轟炸，本人至爲憤慨，對被害中國無辜民衆不勝悲痛。余在京時與褚部長民誼林部長柏生等諸要人，於十二日觀轟炸長沙之影片，其景况慘忍，全塲均極憤慨，於日軍開進長沙，市民返歸後，敵美機即大肆轟炸，致使長沙市炸成廢墟。渝軍於撤退長沙時限令市民兩天撤凈，所有物件均不能携帶，致使數十萬人民，均身無長物，長沙本爲文化都市，政治中心，遭此浩刧，可見敵美之慘無人道矣。</p>
<h3>讀者助學消息　銀錢界昨熱烈響應　昨收助金達四十萬元</h3>
<p>本報讀者助學金「特別勸募」事，昨承各方熱烈贊助，尤以銀行界踴躍捐輸，殊堪欽佩。如交通銀行唐壽民，聯易銀行潘三省，永祥錢莊馮紹舟諸氏，先後來函，表示贊助，並各認隊慨捐助金，預料今後銀行界將竭力推動，則本報勸募工作，可以順利進行，引領盼望之四千餘學子，不勝馨香禱祝。慈　馮受之先生，爲本市錢業先進，曾任錢業董事有年，生前熱心公益，對於敎育事業，尤爲注意，去世後其哲嗣馮作舟馮邁羣二君，現均服務金融事業，秉承其先君子遺志，設有馮受之公貨學義金，本報歷届助學金，每有捐助。今屆特別勸募隊，又荷其慨允一隊，自捐及代募共計十萬元，仍以馮受之公貨學基金紀念隊爲名，孝思義舉，嘉惠後學，殊堪欽佩。願各界熱心人士，慨解仁囊，達成二千萬元目標，則四千餘清寒子弟幸甚，本報幸甚。</p>
<p>郎氏影展各界好評</p>
<p>新聞報及本報聯合主辦之郎靜山夫婦攝影國畫義展，假大新畫廳開幕，已歷六日，各界人士每日到會參觀者，戶限爲穿。今日爲星期六，預料來賓更爲踴躍，惟明日星期，大新公司例假，暫停一天。昨據郎氏表示獻給新申兩報助貨學金之十幅，係本人最得意且曾在國際影展獲獎者，希望熱心人士如數認購，以盡救濟清寒學子之微意。</p>
<p>許氏義展最後三天</p>
<p>許氏道藝室主人假成都路中國畫苑義賣畫　文玩，以紀念其收藏廿周之紀念，兩項各百餘件，畫有沈石田·徐天池·曾波臣·王廉州·石濤·吳梅卿·以至近代之廉夫伯年等，古玩有圖韋·硯石·印匣·陳墨·漢玉·竹刻·瑪瑙·紫砂·茄瓢等。義賣全部所得，除會塲租費雇員工飯外，完全捐助申新兩報助貨學金及其所辦各項慈善事業，連日雖陰雨風雪，承樂善諸君子不棄，踴躍惠臨，文玩部份泰半巳經定購，書畫部份亦售去相當數量，惟會期短促，祗餘三日，樂畫諸公，弗失交臂。</p>
<p>銀行行員極表同情</p>
<p>上海實業銀行韓慈生函云：「敬啓者，貴報熱心公益，辦理助學金，嘉惠清塞，莫名欽敬，竊思今日之華華學子，悉　年社會之中堅，晚迫於經濟，早歲輟學就商，深感才識疏淺，謹竭棉力，奉上儘備三千元，祈收入助金項下，　　之數，以冀拋磚引玉。深願我職業青年，羣起響應，各就能力，踴躍輸將。」</p>
<p>又該行劉知止君函云：「逕啓者：貴報資助清塞學子，爲國備才，無任欽佩！鄙人亦係失學之一，深感學無一成之苦，今差幸恭爲銀行一小職員，雖在此物價瘋狂高漲之時，入不敷出，惟爲響應貴報　請銀錢業同仁發動集體捐助起見，特爲節衣縮食，奉上本月份　津之一部份。明知杯水車薪，無濟於事，但望銀錢業有力者之繼起也」。</p>
<p>昨收助金　韓慈生三千元，芻知止一千元，陶君五百元，浦緝庭（祝善士康樂）一百元，共收儲券四千六百元，結存六百八十四萬三千六百四十八元。</p>
<p>第八屆申報讀者助學金特別勸募隊</p>
<p>以上共計四十萬元　總計一百九十六萬元</p>
<p>（三十六至三十九四隊爲馮受之公紀念隊）</p>
<p>昨承交通銀行，聯易銀行，永祥錢莊共認六隊，已如前文所述外，又蒙泰和祥，黃振東，豐記，裕華烟廠，新亞印刷廠，華昌化學廠，（以上三隊係大陸廣告公司劉鏡川君經募）各認一隊，熱忱助學，不勝感謝。甚望海上工商各業，一致響應，多方推動，慷慨解囊，使四千餘清寒優秀青年，均有繼續求學之機會，社會國家，實蒙其利。</p>

<h3>改進國醫藥　維持民族康健芻議</h3>
<p>— 仁</p>
<p>自戰爭以來，醫藥一項，幾爲貴族式之專利品；中下階級，一且選疾，初起每　延以希僥倖自愈，坐使可治之症，而病入膏盲者實數　不　。或則以有害無益之仙方作生命孤注之　，嗚呼！此輩枉死之貧黎，着我人加以詳細統計，共數字定使我人該嘆！</p>
<p>我人試再瞻視有救人職志之國醫藥界，除一部分因歷史或資本關係爲貴族式　　役使外，鄉郊地區之醫界從業員苦况，與小學敎員不相上下，而藥店之清淡，亦非局外人所能洞悉，此畸形矛盾之慘局，緣何若此？　結何在？姑　申述如下：</p>
<p>（一）貧苦民衆患病後既失生產能力，而家庭之開支伙食仍不可少，若再延醫服藥勢在不能。</p>
<p>（二）醫界從業員生涯鼎盛者則高抬診例，以顯身分，籍此限止，緣此貧病猛將望而却走，其次業務清淡者，則幾成隱貧狀態，脫有求治者則用江湖方式詐欺行爲，以補其業務收入之缺憾，於是貧病即能羅掘以應，亦祗能一而不能再。</p>
<p>以上二項實一部分國醫界之趨勢，雖亦有名符其「仁心仁　」者，但終屬少數。</p>
<p>（三）國藥號業之生涯，本較其他國業之盈利高昂，其資本豪大歷史攸久者，目標專爲當　段使，故價格即使十分高昂，而不慮營業低落。（然此爲都市所特有，總屬少數。）多半則因貨料較次，或其門面無宏峻之壯觀，專營中下級之主顧，在戰前大藥店與小藥店之售價相差幾逾半數以上，至今則郊區恐仍有此項現象，以上海而論，則大藥店操縱同業公會，標價概須一律，是以貧病更不克負擔，試觀今日各慈善團辦施診給藥者，內科外科求治之統計可以相等，倘單施診而不給藥者，則祗有外症求治，（因外症普通皆備有專藥）內科則極屬少數，蓋皆藥價過高所致，此非我　　之　，實有例可舉！</p>
<p>有此三者則貧病呻吟呌號，無復　類，或則帶病延年，而民族健康更無起色之一天，國醫藥界亦無全面發展入正軌光明之境，然我人既知其慘酷之成因，將無法樞轉乎？曰：否，亦對弊從治可也！芻議如下，以待社會人士及當局有所參酌：</p>
<p>須知病家無力延醫，並非無醫生；醫生無人求治，並非無病人。病人無力服藥，非無藥店；藥店營業清淡，亦非無病人，扼要在此擬法，曰施醫，曰平價配藥。</p>
<p>施醫　調查醫學從業人員人數，作比例分派，如一鎭有住家千戶，醫者五人，則每一醫者負有診治二二百戶中間病人之職，（規定一定時間）倘其中有自顧延醫，不必施治隨便，或則此一鎭上之醫士可業一處合作施診者，亦可，因時因地，以求捷便益宏，隨事制宜，　者之診金希市政當局或地方紳士負職，務求適應，當地生活程度，否則弊端定不能免。</p>
<p>平價配藥　國藥最近漲價與前月相較，亦在百分之三百左右，我人欲求平價配藥，不必仰求藥儈，但希社會人士，熱心公益者創立平價國藥號，售價須照普通國藥低廉半數（實洋）以上，蓋今之藥店其進本每斤百元者，每兩出售亦近百元左右，即使加工切製加上開支等費，如用人得當，尙可獲利，且藥價既廉，平民求配者必多，以此卜知勞而不費，抑平藥價左券可操。</p>

<h3>Minister Chen of the Executive Yuan Visits Japan: Cordial Talks with Key Figures of the Central Government; Both Nations to Further Cooperate in Completing the War</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency Telegram) The Propaganda Department released a public announcement at 12:00 noon on December 15th, as follows: Minister Chen of the Executive Yuan of the National Government departed from Nanjing on the 14th to visit Japan. Prior to his departure, he led all accompanying personnel to Zhongshan Mausoleum and Plum Blossom Hill to pay their respects, informing the spirit of the Father of the Nation and Chairman Wang in heaven.</p>
<p>This trip is to personally express gratitude for the courtesy extended by the Japanese Imperial Family and the kindness of the Japanese Imperial Government and the goodwill of the Japanese people during Chairman Wang's treatment period, as well as condolences upon Chairman Wang's passing. It also serves to declare to the Japanese government and public that the National Government, leading the people, will not shy away from difficulties and dangers, inherit Chairman Wang's legacy, thoroughly implement established policies, and remain steadfast in its determination. It aims to further strengthen Sino-Japanese cooperation, redouble efforts in completing the war, and spare no effort in upholding the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty of the Liu era and the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, striving to ensure that every word and sentence is realized.</p>
<p>Accompanying Minister Chen are Minister of Foreign Affairs Chu Minyi, General of the Army and President of the Military Advisory Council Xiao Shuxuan, Minister of Propaganda Lin Baisheng, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan Zhou Longxiang, and Zhong Renshou, Lin Ji, Zhu Xu, Liu Zhuozhang, and others.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency Telegram) Chen Gongbo, Minister of the Executive Yuan of the National Government, arrived here by plane on the 15th with his entourage to express gratitude to the Japanese government and public for their kindness towards Chairman Wang during his treatment and passing, and to declare the determination of the National Government. The Japanese Information Bureau released a public announcement at 12:00 noon on the 15th, as follows: Minister Chen of the Executive Yuan of the National Government arrived in Tokyo by plane on the 15th to express gratitude to the Japanese government and public for their kindness during the late Chairman Wang's treatment and death, to offer greetings following his new appointment, and to hold important cordial talks with key figures of the Imperial Government.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency Telegram) Chen Gongbo, Minister of the Executive Yuan of the National Government, arrived in Japan at noon on the 15th. After a short rest, he entered the Imperial Palace at 1:30 PM to leave a card of respect. At 2:00 PM, he visited Prime Minister Koiso at the Prime Minister's official residence. At 2:30 PM, he visited Naval Minister Yonai and Chief of Naval Operations Kawa separately at the Ministry of the Navy. At around 3:00 PM, he held cordial talks with Foreign Minister and Minister of Greater East Asia Affairs Shigemitsu at the Foreign Minister's official residence.</p>
<p>The Japanese Minister of Greater East Asia Affairs Hosts Minister Chen of the Executive Yuan</p>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency Telegram) To entertain Minister Chen of the Executive Yuan, Japanese Minister of Greater East Asia Affairs Shigemitsu hosted a dinner party at the Foreign Minister's official residence starting at 6:00 PM on the 15th. In addition to the guest of honor, Minister Chen, accompanying personnel including Minister of Foreign Affairs Chu, Minister of Propaganda Lin, President of the Military Advisory Council Xiao, and Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan Zhou all attended. On the Japanese side, many prominent figures from the government and public, including Baron Kiichiro Hiranuma and Minister of Finance Ishiwata, were present. The party concluded joyfully at around 8:00 PM. During the dinner, Minister Shigemitsu delivered a welcome speech, the gist of which is as follows: Your Excellency, Minister Chen, like the late Chairman Wang, is a comrade advocating peace and national construction in China, and has made great contributions to the prosperity of the Shanghai Special Municipality in particular. Today, you are inheriting Chairman Wang's legacy and overseeing the political situation in the new China. We would like to express our respect to the leader of China upon your esteemed visit to the Imperial Capital, and are very fortunate to be able to directly hear your great theories on the construction of China's revival and East Asia. The construction of China and the revival of East Asia are by no means easy tasks. Moreover, the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States have invaded China and are now attacking East Asia with all their strength. However, during this decisive battle, they have fully understood the true nature of the decisive battle, and the decisive battle will certainly not deviate from our expectations. Thanks to the attacking spirit of the brave warriors on the Philippine front today, we firmly believe that the front and rear will fight to the end with this spirit and achieve victory. At the same time, we also firmly believe that the great cause of China's construction and the revival of East Asia are our common goals, and the future is very bright. Furthermore, Sino-Japanese relations have long been established, as clearly stipulated in the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, swearing eternal friendship and cooperation under the principle of equality and mutual benefit to defend East Asia and serve as the foundation for world peace. This common goal of ours is well known to all people, including the leaders of China, and we are convinced of the success of China's construction.</p>

<h3>Realization of the Transcontinental Railway is Imminent: Only 800 Kilometers of Track Remaining to be Laid</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency Telegram) A land route from Tokyo, through the mainland, directly to Annam, Thailand, Burma, and Malaya should, in its essence, have been realized long ago. For example, during the era of Imperial Russia and up to the Soviet Red Army, a great transcontinental railway was established to connect the barren and desolate Siberia and the unpopulated Turkestan. However, it is strange that among the densely populated and materially flowing countries of East Asia today, there is not a single transcontinental railway. The main reasons for this strange situation can be roughly divided into the following three points: First, Asia has not been able to solve major issues. Asia has been divided into several spheres of influence or colonies by non-Asian forces. These lands and organizations with different natures are all areas that repel each other and mutually exclude entry. Whether it is Annam, Malaya, or Burma, they will definitely not allow the capital of other countries to enter their countries. Furthermore, the transcontinental railways in mainland China have all been blood vessels for non-Asian forces. They were built by non-Asian forces, so although they ostensibly belong to China, they are not actually owned by China itself. The supervision and operation of the railways are also controlled by non-Asian forces. Therefore, matters related to the contact between Asia itself cannot be implemented as desired. Second, among the Asian nations today, only Japan has the ability to independently construct in terms of capital and technology in order to promote the prosperity of all ethnic groups. Third, there are the monopolistic undertakings of countries such as Britain, the United States, and France, especially the maritime ambition of Britain. For example, Jardine Matheson is the company that represents Britain in managing maritime transport in East Asia. They want to monopolize the transportation of East Asian materials by sea, so they have used all their power to prevent the realization of a transcontinental route on the mainland. However, the continental transcontinental railway from the hinterland of China to the seaports is in line with their interests, so they have strongly supported its construction. Due to the above main reasons, the transcontinental railway on the Asian continent has had no possibility of being realized. Therefore, Japan has made a special effort to resolve this unreasonable situation. Since the Greater East Asia War, due to the military success of the Japanese army, the realization of the transcontinental railway on the mainland is imminent. Currently, the areas between Tokyo and Shonan where railways have not been laid are the areas between Guilin and Liuzhou and between Saigon and Bu Yuse, with a distance of only 830 kilometers. If the Japanese army clears the remnants of the Chongqing army along the railway lines between Hankou, Changsha, and Guilin, then only the problems of capital, materials, and technology will remain. By then, the difficulty of completing the Asian transcontinental railway will be easily solved.</p>
<h3>Japanese Cabinet Decides on Next Year's Budget</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency Telegram) The Japanese government held an extraordinary cabinet meeting at the Prime Minister's official residence at 3:00 PM on the 15th.

They resolved on the supplementary general budget for expenditures for the Showa 20th fiscal year and the previously decided baseline budget, and decided on the general budget for revenues and expenditures for the Showa 20th fiscal year. The meeting adjourned at around 4:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Japan's Recovery of Platinum Achieves Excellent Results</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency Telegram) A platinum recovery campaign, which is essential for new weapons, has been launched throughout Japan in the past three days. Thanks to the enthusiastic cooperation of the people, the actual number of platinum recovered nationwide by the 12th of this month has reached more than 230% of the target amount. This platinum has already been made into new weapons and sent to the front lines.</p>
<h3>Tokyo Special Correspondence No. 3: The Battle for Leyte</h3>
<p>— Toshiyuki</p>
<p>On October 18th, an American transport convoy invaded Leyte Gulf and bombarded the coastline. By October 20th, the army under MacArthur, under the cover of both sea and air forces, began to forcibly land on Leyte Island, centered on Tacloban and Dulag. The main force of their landing troops seemed to be Major General Magee's 1st Cavalry Division and Major General Barnwell's 24th Infantry Division. They advanced west from Tacloban along the right side of the Leyte Valley towards Carigara Bay; at the same time, a team centered on the 7th Infantry Division and the 96th Infantry Division advanced towards Ormoc from Dulag on the left side of the Leyte Valley. Their operational plan clearly attempted to bypass the dense forests and valleys, attacking from the north and south in order to drive the Japanese army into Ormoc Bay.</p>
<p>Contending for Air Supremacy</p>
<p>At the beginning of the landing, the American army, relying on the power of heavy cannons and bombs, unloaded many tanks and heavy artillery, captured the airfields near Tacloban and Dulag, and accelerated repairs, using them as bases to increase their air power in an attempt to gain air supremacy. However, the defending troops on the island, fighting against overwhelming odds, skillfully reorganized their lines, firmly defended Dagami Heights and other key high grounds along the valley, and launched surprise attacks by sending suicide squads, plunging into the enemy's rear and causing chaos in their large army. Therefore, the highlands from Carigara to Ormoc are all in the hands of the Japanese army, while the positions held by the American army are only narrow plains along the coast.</p>
<p>The operational strategies for the Battle of Leyte are roughly the same for both Japan and the United States: the first step is to compete for air supremacy in the area, and then cut off the opponent's maritime supply lines, preventing their ground troops from obtaining supplies and reinforcements. Therefore, since the American army began the landing battle on Leyte Island, the air combat situation in the area has become increasingly fierce. Neither side is willing to give up, and there is a stalemate. During this period of over a month, the Japanese army, based on its outstanding traditional spirit, successively dispatched the unparalleled Kamikaze Special Attack Corps to attack the American fleet and transport convoys, achieving many glorious battle results. However, although the American army has suffered serious blows repeatedly, it is unwilling to give up and is constantly drawing fresh air forces from New Guinea to compete with the Japanese air force; at the same time, its transport convoys and naval forces are also braving fierce counterattacks from the Japanese side, struggling desperately to unload reinforcements and weapons ashore.</p>
<p>Implementing Daring Surprise Attacks</p>
<p>As Japanese Prime Minister Koiso said, the Battle of Leyte is the key to the decisive battle in the Pacific. The American army is attempting to succeed at the cost of huge sacrifices, and the Japanese army, based on the so-called Kamikaze spirit of certain death, is determined to defeat the enemy. Therefore, on the one hand, they are sending large armies to reinforce the area, and on the other hand, they are implementing daring surprise attacks on the front lines. In addition to sending suicide squads to launch melee attacks, on the night of November 26th, Army Lieutenant Nakae led the Army Special Attack Corps airborne unit, aboard four transport planes, to land near the American airfields at Dulag and Buroen, and broke into the key parts of the two airfields, inflicting serious damage. Later, on the morning of December 6th, the Japanese army in the western area of Buroen broke into the American lines and advanced towards the airfield. On the same night, the Takachiho parachute unit landed separately at the American-held airfields in Buroen, San Pablo, Dulag, and Tacloban. After the branch attacking Buroen made contact with the ground troops attacking the area, they immediately occupied the airfield, while the Takachiho units in other locations also established great achievements. The bridgehead that the American army had painstakingly built was thus thrown into a state of chaos. In order to reverse the decline and boost morale, the American army landed about one division of reinforcements near Alvera, about eight kilometers southeast of Ormoc on Leyte Island, on the morning of the 7th. The Japanese army intercepted and attacked head-on on the ground, inflicting heavy damage, while also dispatching air force to bombard its landing site and subsequent convoys, sinking and destroying many of its ships. On the 10th, in the Surigao Strait southeast of Leyte Island, the Japanese Danxin Special Attack Corps, braving intense defensive fire, sank two large transport ships, a cruiser or large destroyer, and two large landing craft, destroyed a large transport ship, and set a cruiser or large destroyer on fire.</p>
<p>Heavy Losses for the Americans</p>
<p>Since the airborne units and the Takachiho unit launched surprise attacks on the American airfields on Leyte Island, and the Japanese ground troops launched an offensive, the balance in the area has been broken. The base air power of the American army on Leyte Island has weakened significantly. Currently, the airfields on the island that the American army can use are only Tacloban, Dulag, and the recently established Tanauan. These airfields have been riddled with holes due to the Japanese army's forced landings and continuous bombing. Except for the take-off and landing of a few small aircraft, large aircraft cannot use them. Regarding this situation, even the American radio broadcasts admitted: "Recently, the Japanese air force in the Philippines has greatly strengthened, and due to the attacks of the Japanese Special Attack Corps, our losses have also been very heavy."

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>On Rice Policy</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the leading figures of the Municipal Advisory Committee, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the Commercial Control Committee of this city hosted the members of the press rice-producing area inspection team of this city. On one hand, they expressed their appreciation for their hard work, and on the other hand, based on the report released by the team regarding rural economy, agricultural production, and the purchase of rice, they exchanged opinions and discussed more comprehensive proposals. However, coincidentally at the time of the reception, the rice price in this city was rising madly. Because the reception included municipal authorities, commercial control authorities, rice control authorities, and rice industry leaders, it can be said that they all have considerable responsibility for rice. Therefore, the discussion of the Shanghai food problem appeared particularly deeply concerned.</p>
<p>We have always believed that the soaring rice price in Shanghai (referring to the price outside the rationed rice fixed price) is unreasonable and artificial. In other words, it is caused by the government's lax management of rice prices and the opportunistic behavior of general profiteers. Based on the opinions of the gentlemen at yesterday's reception, and combined with the consistent advocacy of this newspaper, we offer the following suggestions:</p>
<p>First, we have pointed out before that Shanghai is a place for manufacturing rumors, especially groundless and unfounded rumors. Profiteering merchants create rumors to pursue exorbitant profits. Therefore, there are always rumors before each wave of price increases; conversely, after rumors arise, prices skyrocket. Rumors are the cause, and rising prices are the effect. For example, the recent soaring price of gold and the sudden rise and fall of stocks are all caused by the mischief of profiteering merchants. The madness of the current rice price is the same example, and the result is that rumors are after all rumors, and they collapse by themselves. However, prices do not fall back after rising, and at most, they only fall back a little after rising greatly. It is regrettable that people who easily believe in rumors suffer from them, but they are still not aware of it, and they still believe in the next rumors as the truth. The current skyrocketing rice price is due to the rice dealers shouting and raising prices at will. Of course, there are profiteering merchants behind the rice dealers to support them. Profiteering merchants are the termites hoarding rice. We advocate that on the one hand, the public should remain calm, and on the other hand, the authorities should strictly manage the rice prices outside of the rationed rice. At the same time, those who create rumors to seek exorbitant profits and those who create rumors to raise rice prices should be subject to the most severe criminal penalties. And encourage the public to report by means of incentives.</p>
<p>Second, the current emergency countermeasures to stop profiteering merchants from creating rumors include: (1) Distributing household rice in advance once or twice, for example, distributing it on the 5th instead of the 10th. (2) Especially increase the allocation of miscellaneous grains once for military police, public teachers, laborers, salaried classes, etc. Originally, we advocated that the rationing system should adopt the principle of focusing on key points. This is a remedy before the implementation of the key rationing system, that is, to prevent salaried classes and laborers from being affected by profiteering merchants raising rice prices. Because salaried classes and laborers are not affected by profiteering merchants raising prices, the black market will not have a socially unsettling effect.</p>
<p>Third, the above emergency countermeasures are temporary solutions. As for the fundamental solutions, (1) we must emphasize the rapid implementation of a key rationing system. (2) The ration amount for military police, public teachers, laborers, salaried classes, etc. must be sufficient. But it does not have to be pure rice, miscellaneous grains are also acceptable. Because rice production is limited in wartime, everyone should break the concept that they must eat rice and advocate eating miscellaneous grains. (3) The wealthy and those who make exorbitant profits should not only not receive rations, but must also bear the obligation of providing food for the people working for them. For example, the secretaries, clerks, accountants, laborers, etc. employed by the wealthy, or the partners and workers employed by profitable private stores and factories, must all bear a portion of the rice. During implementation, surveys should be conducted according to the Baojia system to achieve accuracy. At the same time, it should be strictly stipulated that anyone who commits fraud in the Baojia during the decision of key rationing, making inaccurate surveys, or any public official who commits fraud, should be subject to the condemnation of public opinion and the punishment of national law. (4) Effectively increase agricultural production. The previous production increase movement was only superficial, and a large amount of funding was spent in vain. The farmers themselves did not receive any real benefits. Even the publicity work was only promoted in the cities, and the farmers in the countryside did not know about it at all. We hope that in the future, production increase funds can give real benefits to farmers, such as fertilizers, agricultural tools, and loans, etc., and not be embezzled by cooperatives or Xiang Baojia chiefs. For example, those in Shanghai with capital or banks should not use hoarding goods for speculation as their business, but directly lend to farmers so that they do not suffer from high-interest loans. In short, the government and the people should promote practical and feasible production increase plans to ensure the actual results of production increase in the next year.</p>
<p>Fourth, unblocking rice sources is urgently needed, regardless of temporary or fundamental solutions. This responsibility, of course, lies with the Rice Control Committee. Now the Rice Control Committee authorities have recognized the past failures, and everything is gradually being improved. Incompetent employees are also gradually being eliminated. At the same time, they can accept public opinion, such as inviting reporters from this city to inspect the rice-producing areas, which is a concrete manifestation. We hope to go a step further, and the people must recognize the overall situation, that we are currently at war. At the same time, the Rice Control Committee should fully accept public opinion, and under the consideration of both parties, make the rice sources increase day by day.</p>
<p>Finally, the rice problem is extremely serious at present, but it is definitely not something that can be solved by simply sighing helplessly or by detaching from reality. We hope that the relevant authorities and social leaders will openly discuss and implement practical and realistic countermeasures to gradually reduce its severity.</p>
<p>Dredging of Lake Yinhu to Commence Preliminary Work; Decision to Establish an Office in Suzhou</p>
<p>Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency Telegram) The former Water Conservancy and Production Increase Design Committee of the Ministry of Construction had determined four water conservancy and production increase plans last year: (1) Dongtai Lake Dredging Plan, (2) Yinhu Lake Dredging Plan, (3) Furong Dike Water Lifting and Irrigation Project, and (4) Completion of the Huayang Sluice Project. In order to carry them out in sequence, the Dongtai Lake Dredging Engineering Bureau was first established this year. Later, because the personnel of the bureau were not fully established and the construction measures were improper, the progress of the project suffered heavy losses and has now come to a standstill. Now, the former Ministry of Construction believes that water conservancy construction is an urgent need at present, so it is taking advantage of the current favorable opportunity for the Yinhu Lake dredging project to commence dredging work in that area. For this purpose, the Ministry of Construction has long begun various construction preparations, and the required funds and food for workers have already been roughly settled through communication between the Ministry of Construction and relevant parties. It has been decided to establish a Yinhu Lake Dredging Engineering Construction Office in Suzhou within a certain period. It is heard that the candidate for the director of the office will be concurrently held by Minister Fu, and 40 pumping machine boats will be rented immediately. At the same time, all the technical personnel of the Water Conservancy Department will also go to the construction site to start preliminary work.</p>

<h3>"Mud and High Altitude": American Magazine Discusses the Leyte Battle Situation, Encountering Unexpected Counterattacks by the Japanese Army Everywhere</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 15th (Central News Agency Telegram) The American magazine Time published a report on the Pacific War on December 4th, entitled "Mud and High Altitude," discussing the Leyte Island operation as follows: The Leyte Island operation will take at least two more months. Since the beginning of the tropical rainy season, the battle has completely fallen into a stalemate in the mud. The current operations of the American army are progressing more slowly than when they landed on Leyte, so attacking Luzon has become a dream. Although Leyte is only 300 miles away from Manila, the American army's hope of reaching Manila before New Year's Eve has long vanished. The staff of MacArthur's army have no common sense and have not considered the difficult operations in the Leyte mud after entering December. The roads on the Philippine Islands have been difficult, and under the heavy pressure of new weapons, they will be completely destroyed. The maps of Leyte Island drawn by the American army are unexpectedly simple, so they are encountering unexpected counterattacks by the Japanese army everywhere. Therefore, the Japanese army is still gathering a considerable number of air forces in the Philippines, and the American Navy has to be vigilant.</p>

<p>Travel Correspondence</p>
<h3>North China Resources and North China Development (1)</h3>
<p>— Wu Gong</p>
<p>(1) Continued</p>
<p>This reporter was dispatched to North China to investigate the economy. I stayed in the old capital for more than two months. The impression I got from this trip was very deep. Especially what I felt was that in this era, if you have no economy, you have no politics. The territorial integrity and administrative integrity that were valued in the past only stated the political side of sovereignty. In addition, resource integrity and material management integrity can be said to be the economic side of a country's sovereignty. Due to the enlightenment of the war, there is no doubt that the latter will be more important than the former. No matter how good the relationship between the two countries is, simply focusing on mutual respect for their sovereignty in politics is no match for mutual respect for their sovereignty in economics. If a country loses its sovereignty in economics, this country is no different from a country about to perish. At the same time, a strong country will never be so foolish as to only want to occupy the land of other countries without thinking about seizing its resources. In order to reconcile the relationship between strong and weak countries, the term economic cooperation has emerged internationally. However, international economic cooperation, if it should completely abandon all aggressive intentions, must be mutual assistance and cooperation based on equality.</p>
<p>Our country and our ally Japan are now in a comrade-in-arms relationship of shared existence and death. Naturally, the economic cooperation that has always been talked about should show its importance. Due to this relationship, in order to establish a foundation for building co-prosperity and war power, our allies have continued to call for a comprehensive planned economy with China, Japan, and Manchuria as one. This comprehensive planned economy has obviously gone beyond the original form of economic cooperation. Its only major goal is to complete victory and construction. In this situation, when this reporter traveled north to inspect the economy, the first thing that should be valued is the existing resources of North China and the agencies responsible for developing these resources. Since the Incident, our country has first sought political revival, which is already difficult due to limited manpower. Therefore, the economic revival largely depends on the cooperation of our allies. Although in this cooperative posture, due to a special development at the time, it has not been as ideal as it should be, it has made the people of the country realize the importance of their national defense resources, which is not necessarily a good lesson.</p>
<p>Speaking of economic development in North China, we should first pay attention to the fact that in the comprehensive plan with China, Japan, and Manchuria as one, the integration of North China, Inner Mongolia, and the three countries of Japan and Manchuria is the root of East Asia's defense power. In other words, North China bears an extremely important economic mission in the final stage of the decisive battle: to form the main force for this integrated operation. Within this region, there are five components of national defense resources: namely coal, iron, salt, alum shale, and cotton. According to our allies, the success or failure of North China's economic construction is the victory or defeat of the Greater East Asia War!</p>
<p>(2) North China's National Defense Resources</p>
<p>Now let me briefly describe the current situation of North China's five national defense resources. The first is coal, which constitutes the standard of national power. The amount of coal buried in North China accounts for about 80% of the total amount buried in China, accounting for about 130 billion tons. According to recent figures, I am afraid that it will increase further. Even taking the total coal production in China in the 23rd year of the Republic of China, it accounted for 83%. Moreover, North China's coal not only has a favorable natural environment, but also has excellent mechanical equipment and technical guidance from our allies, so the future productivity must have a quantum leap. The so-called favorable natural environment means that the coal seam is very thick, the distance from the surface is short, there is very little gas in the pit, and it can be operated even with naked fire, and the amount of water gushing is very small, and the ground is strong, and the amount of pit wood used is also small. Therefore, only one-third of the funds and materials required for development are sufficient. At the same time, the coal quality ranges from lignite to highly bituminous coal, and the styles are different, and the scope of utilization is extremely wide. Especially the strong coking bituminous coal that is indispensable for iron-making raw material charcoal, North China is extremely rich in reserves. Furthermore, North China's coal also has suitable conditions for being used as raw material charcoal for making synthetic petroleum. From this, we can know the importance of future construction.</p>
<p>Speaking of iron, the amount buried in North China can be estimated to be more than 300 million tons. Among them, the Longyan in Inner Mongolia is the most abundant, and its reserves account for two-thirds of the total in North China. Secondly, the Jinling Town in Shandong is also extremely important. It is said that the minable amount reaches 6 million to 100 million tons or more. In addition, there are so-called taro-shaped deposits throughout Shanxi Province, but they have not yet become planned mass mining. During iron-making, about three tons of coal are required to produce one ton of iron. Therefore, since North China is rich in coal reserves, there are great expectations for its future heavy industry development.</p>
<p>The importance of salt is not just for food, but because it has become a necessary material for both soda industry, dye industry, and other so-called salt-based chemical industries. Especially the materials for chemical weapons, the extent to which salt is needed is even more astonishing. Therefore, salt has also become one of North China's important national defense resources. North China has both pond salt, well salt, and rock salt, but what is currently being developed as industrial salt is sea salt. The coast of Bohai Sea and Shandong area are the main producing areas. There have always been two salt-making methods: (1) Boiling method, such as Japan, (2) Solar salt-making method, which is the current situation in North China today. The most superior condition for the latter is that the actual evaporation is very large. Therefore, today the Changlu salt fields in North China are as wide as 1,600 ch, and the Qingdao salt fields are also as wide as 816 ch. Compared with the Hiroshima salt fields in Japan (313 ch) or the Haizhou in Central China (400 ch), it is really a small witch seeing a great witch.</p>
<p>Alum shale is often neglected by the general public, but it is actually an extremely important part of modern military raw materials. Because alum shale contains aluminum, it has an unusually important mission in the aluminum manufacturing industry. It is said that the reserves of alum shale found in North China, which is the aluminum original ore, can be estimated at 400 million tons in the Kailuan coal mining area of eastern Hebei. In particular, there are the most that contain more than 60% aluminum. In addition, the reserves in the coal mining areas of Zichuan, Boshan, and Zhangqiu in Shandong Province are also 1.4 billion tons.</p>
<p>The last national defense resource is cotton. Originally, cotton is a tropical product, but temperate North China also contains many good conditions. In North China, the temperature rises immediately after spring, and the summer has a particularly high temperature. This is the first condition for cotton cultivation. Secondly, there are many sunny days and little rain, and more precipitation in the three months of June, July, and August is also a good condition. Although the loess in North China lacks nitrogen, as long as water and ammonium sulfate fertilizer are added, cotton production is more profitable than food. Therefore, cotton production will become the main agricultural product in North China in the future. At present, it is moving towards a target of 10 million dan of production. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Economic Bureau Discusses Electricity Allocation Methods: Scheduled to Convene a Manufacturers Meeting on the 18th</h3>
<p>The Economic Bureau of this city previously conducted a survey of electricity consumption and production measurement in various factories. Except for factories related to military needs and manufacturing daily necessities, which are still allowed to register before the end of this month, the bureau has scheduled to convene the chairmen of the industry associations of various major factories and enterprises in this city, and the representatives of 57 industries including food, clothing, machinery, chemical daily necessities, culture, paper, cigarette factories, and pharmaceuticals, at the conference room of the bureau at 3:00 PM on the 18th of this month to hold a joint meeting to discuss the future electricity allocation methods.

<p>Installation of Engines Requires Re-inspection</p>
<p>Since the restriction of electricity supply in this city, the number of factories that set up their own steam engines or internal combustion engines to generate electricity has been increasing. However, if the installation and use of these engines are slightly careless, there is a risk of endangering life. The Municipal Public Works Bureau, as the department in charge, should ban these engines to ensure safety. According to Article 12 of the Factory License Rules, if there are any changes or additions to the factory site, whether or not it is a construction project, a permit must first be obtained from the bureau. (1) All factories in this city that have steam engines or internal combustion engines installed (including charcoal, firewood, and diesel engines) should apply for re-inspection at the Public Works Section of the bureau at Room 346, 180 Fuzhou Road before the 31st of this month. If they are overdue, they will be punished according to regulations for privately using machinery that has not been inspected. (2) In the future, factories that newly install steam engines or internal combustion engines or renovate existing machinery and equipment must first apply to the bureau for re-inspection and approval before they can be used. In addition, it is stipulated that factories in the southern district (former eight districts) should apply to the factory section of the bureau for a factory license before the 31st of this month. If they are overdue, they will be punished according to regulations for setting up a factory and working without a license. In the future, new factories in the district must obtain a factory license from the bureau before they are allowed to start construction.</p>

The citizens of this city have been enthusiastically visiting the exhibition, so it has been decided to extend the exhibition by five days until the 20th.</p>
<h3>Education Bureau Sets Up Special Committee to Review the Registration of Private Schools</h3>
<p>In view of the fact that many private schools at all levels in this city have applied for registration in recent months, (all schools that have not been registered must apply for registration in accordance with the law, and those that have been registered before the incident only need to submit their registration documents and complete the registration), the Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, Dai, has set up a Private School Registration Review Committee out of caution, and has appointed senior officials of the bureau to serve as members, responsible for handling the above matters, which was established yesterday.</p>
<h3>Materials Movement Control: Application to Define Scope</h3>
<p>Regarding the registration of the movement of major items, the Economic Bureau of Shanghai Special City previously sent a letter to the Commercial Control Committee and the Grain, Flour, Oil, Cotton, Daily Necessities and other control committees, requesting that they be transferred to the jurisdiction of the bureau. The Commercial Control Committee convened a meeting of the Standing Committee a few days ago and specially discussed this issue. As a result, the various control committees stated that the Materials Movement Control Regulations promulgated by the Executive Yuan stipulated that since various major materials were controlled by the various control committees, the tasks of purchasing, allocating, and controlling the movement of materials were all the responsibility of the respective control committees. If the materials are controlled, the application for movement should be handled by the Materials Movement Permit Office of the Commercial Control Committee. Therefore, it was unanimously resolved to submit a request to the Executive Yuan to define the scope of movement control in accordance with the provisions of the Materials Movement Control Regulations.</p>

The current minimum valuation is 1,000 yuan per mu, and the maximum is 500,000 yuan, all taxed at 6%. However, when land prices rise, the municipal government can be petitioned to increase the valuation at any time to emphasize land administration.</p>
<p>Housing Issues</p>
<p>(1) (Central News Agency asked) How many absentee-owned houses and land are there in this city? (Answer) The statistics on absentee-owned houses in this city can only be obtained after the registration is completed. The current number under the management of this committee is 119 buildings in the southern city and 247 buildings in northern Shanghai. Land that has not been registered is difficult to count temporarily. (2) (Central News Agency asked) If the original owner submits proof of ownership, what procedures should be followed for claiming it? (Answer) It has already been answered in the first item of the inquiry from the China Daily. (3) (Central News Agency asked) How will the Housing Management Committee handle unclaimed houses in the future? (Answer) Regarding the houses under the management of this committee, if no owner submits a property certificate to apply for return after a long period of time, how to deal with it will be submitted to the municipal government for approval of the method. (4) (Central News Agency asked) How is the rent received by the Housing Management Committee for the houses under its management handled? (Answer) The rent collected by this committee for the houses under its management has been resolved by the committee meeting of this committee and approved by the municipal government. In addition to returning 50% to the owner, the remaining 50%, in northern Shanghai, 10% is used for the residency fee of the Resident Group, 20% is used for the committee's expenses, and 20% is used for the committee's staff bonuses. In the southern city, 30% is used for the committee's expenses and 20% is used for the committee's staff bonuses. (5) (Central News Agency asked) How does the Housing Management Committee determine the ownership of houses with lost certificates? (Answer) If the owner loses the property certificate, they should apply to the Land Administration Bureau in accordance with the law, and this committee can obtain the certificate from the Land Administration Bureau before the ownership can be determined. (6) (China Daily asked) After the absentee owners' land and houses are registered, what are the disposal methods? (Answer) Although the committee has investigated the houses of absentee owners before, there may be omissions. Therefore, this registration is held so that the houses of owners who are not in Shanghai can be managed and rented by the committee to ensure that they are not occupied or damaged. If the owner returns to Shanghai and submits accurate property documents, they will be returned. In addition, it should be explained that in order to investigate whether the owner is present or absent, a comprehensive registration must be carried out, and then it can be known which owners are present and which are absent. Therefore, owners in Shanghai must register uniformly. (7) (China Daily asked) It is rumored that when applying for land registration for absentee owners, it is said that the registration has been stopped. Will it continue to be handled in the future? (Answer) This committee only handles house registration. Land registration has not been held. The rumor about land registration is probably a rumor.</p>

<h3>British Fleet's Strength is Weak; Will Follow in the Footsteps of the US Military; Minister Matsushima Delivers Speech</h3>
<p>The Allied Forces' China Fleet Press Department held its regular press conference at 2:00 PM yesterday, receiving Chinese news reporters. Minister Matsushima reported on the battle situation on Leyte Island in the Philippines in the Pacific, and the situation of the battle for Leyte Island. The details are recorded on the left:</p>
<p>Philippine Battle Situation</p>
<p>The battle for Leyte Island in the Pacific is becoming increasingly tense. The enemy US is reinforcing Leyte Island, intending to attack Ormoc. Our army units are inflicting great blows on them. There has been considerable fierce fighting along the coast of Leyte Island. The enemy US is experiencing difficulties in supplying materials due to the excessive length of the supply line, especially all the airfields on the east coast of Leyte Island have been severely attacked by our army aircraft. According to the latest accurate news, the enemy US is extremely urgent and important for the replenishment of troops. When transport ships risk delivering them, they do not even send aircraft carriers to escort them, and the damage is obviously severe. In addition, the fleet commanded by British Admiral Fraser has now become the Pacific Fleet, the reasons for which are: first, the US Pacific Fleet has suffered great damage in the Philippines, and its strength is weak; second, the UK intends to fight for the right to speak after the war, but the British group has no strength and is not worth mentioning. Considering that the British fleet was only able to open to the Pacific after sinking the German battleship Tirpitz, Germany can contain the British fleet with one battleship, which is enough to show that the British fleet is weak and powerless. As a result, after the US Navy failed, the British Navy continued, but the British air power is weak and unable to fight, and it is inevitable to follow in the footsteps of failure. In the future, there will be many difficulties in the cooperation between the UK and the US, and they will undoubtedly fail in the war against Japan in the Pacific, especially their supply bases are very difficult. Although the UK claims to have two supply bases in Australia, Sydney and Melbourne, these two places are extremely far from the war zone, and the transportation of agricultural products is even more difficult. Therefore, this time the UK organized the Pacific Fleet, creating a complicated situation between the UK and the US, which is harmful and not beneficial to both the UK and the US. It can be said that the UK is only protecting its past, present and future rights in the Pacific.</p>
<p>Impressions of Nanjing</p>
<p>I saw that the general youth in Nanjing are extremely enthusiastic about patriotism, which is very admirable. If there are good guides and protectors, they will make a great contribution to changing the fate of China. When passing through Zhenjiang, County Magistrate Huang Xiugu led cadres to listen to my speech on the current situation, which shows their concern for the current situation. Recently, I heard that some important Chinese figures will donate several aircraft. The Chinese people's thinking on air raids has also changed recently. They have realized that the aircraft are not from Chongqing, but from the United States, so they have a great aversion to them. Especially for the recent bombing of Hankou, which completely destroyed the lives and property of the Chinese people, the United States' ambition to control East Asia is clearly visible. Especially for the bombing of Changsha, I am extremely angry, and I am extremely sad for the innocent Chinese people who were victimized. When I was in Beijing, I watched the film of the bombing of Changsha with Minister Chu Minyi, Minister Lin Baisheng, and other important figures on the 12th. The scene was cruel, and the whole scene was extremely angry. After the Japanese army entered Changsha and the citizens returned, the enemy US planes bombed indiscriminately, causing Changsha city to be bombed into ruins. When the Chongqing army retreated from Changsha, it ordered the citizens to evacuate within two days, and all items could not be taken away, causing hundreds of thousands of people to have nothing on their bodies. Changsha was originally a cultural city and a political center, and this catastrophe shows the inhumanity of the enemy US.</p>
<h3>Readers' Scholarship News; Silver and Banking Circles Responded Enthusiastically Yesterday; 400,000 Yuan in Aid Received Yesterday</h3>
<p>The "Special Fundraiser" for the Readers' Scholarship of this newspaper was enthusiastically supported by all parties yesterday, especially the banking circle, which donated generously, which is very admirable. For example, Tang Shoumin of Bank of Communications, Pan Sansheng of Lianyi Bank, and Feng Shaozhou of Yongxiang Money Shop sent letters one after another, expressing their support and donating generously to each team. It is expected that the banking circle will do its best to promote it in the future, so the fundraising work of this newspaper can proceed smoothly, and the more than 4,000 students who are eagerly awaited will be sincerely blessed. Mr. Feng Shouzhi, a pioneer in the money industry in this city, served as a director of the money industry for many years. He was enthusiastic about public welfare during his lifetime and paid special attention to education. After his death, his sons Feng Zuozhou and Feng Maiqun, who are now serving in the financial industry, inherited his father's will and established the Feng Shouzhi Public Goods Scholarship. This newspaper has received donations for each scholarship. In this special fundraising team, He He generously approved a team, donating and soliciting a total of 100,000 yuan, still in the name of the Feng Shouzhi Public Goods Scholarship Memorial Team. Filial piety and righteousness benefit future students, which is very admirable. I hope that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will generously donate to achieve the goal of 20 million yuan, then the more than 4,000 poor students will be very fortunate, and this newspaper will be very fortunate.</p>
<p>Lang's Photo Exhibition Receives Favorable Reviews from All Walks of Life</p>
<p>The Lang Jingshan couple's photography and Chinese painting charity exhibition jointly organized by the News Daily and this newspaper has been open for six days in the Daxin Painting Hall. People from all walks of life come to visit every day, and the threshold is broken. Today is Saturday, and it is expected that there will be more guests. However, tomorrow is Sunday, and Daxin Company will be closed for a day as usual. According to Lang, the ten works dedicated to the Xin Shen Daily to help with the goods scholarship are the most proud of him and have won awards in international photography exhibitions. He hopes that enthusiastic people will purchase them in full to do their best to help poor students.</p>
<p>Xu's Charity Exhibition Last Three Days</p>
<p>The owner of Xu's Dao Yi Studio is selling paintings and cultural relics at the China Painting Academy on Chengdu Road to commemorate the 20th anniversary of his collection. There are more than 100 items each. The paintings include Shen Shitian, Xu Tianchi, Zeng Bochen, Wang Lianzhou, Shi Tao, Wu Meiqing, and even Lianfu Bonian in modern times. The antiques include Tu Wei, Inkstone, Seal Box, Chen Ink, Han Jade, Bamboo Carving, Agate, Purple Clay, and Eggplant Shell. All proceeds from the charity sale, except for the rent of the venue and the meals for the employees, are completely donated to the Shen Xin Daily to help with the goods scholarship and the various charitable causes it undertakes. Although it has been raining and snowing for days, gentlemen who are happy to do good have not abandoned it and have come to visit enthusiastically. Most of the cultural relics have been ordered, and a considerable number of paintings and calligraphy have also been sold. However, the exhibition period is short, and only three days are left. Gentlemen who love painting, do not miss it.</p>
<p>Bank Employees Express Great Sympathy</p>
<p>Han Cisheng of Shanghai Industrial Bank wrote: "Respected Editor, your newspaper is enthusiastic about public welfare and runs scholarships to benefit the Qing Sai, which is indescribably admirable. I think that today's Chinese students are all the backbone of society in their youth, and they are forced by the economy to drop out of school early to do business. I deeply feel that my talent and knowledge are shallow. I will do my best and offer a spare of 3,000 yuan, which I hope will be included in the scholarship item to encourage others to donate. I deeply hope that our vocational youth will respond enthusiastically, and each will donate as much as they can."</p>
<p>Also, Mr. Liu Zhizhi of the bank wrote: "Dear Editor: Your newspaper subsidizes Qing Sai students and prepares talents for the country, which is extremely admirable! I am also one of those who dropped out of school, and I deeply feel the pain of having no accomplishments in learning. Now I am fortunately a small employee of a bank. Although the price of goods is rising madly, my income is not enough to cover my expenses. However, in order to respond to your newspaper's request to start a collective donation by colleagues in the silver and money industry, I specially saved food and clothing and offered a portion of my salary for this month. I know that a drop in the bucket will not help, but I hope that those who have the power in the silver and money industry will continue."</p>
<p>Aid received yesterday Han Cisheng 3,000 yuan, Chu Zhizhi 1,000 yuan, Mr. Tao 500 yuan, Pu Qiting (Zhu Shanshi Kang Le) 100 yuan, a total of 4,600 yuan in savings certificates were received, and a balance of 6,843,648 yuan was saved.</p>
<p>Special Fundraising Team for the Eighth Shenbao Readers' Scholarship</p>
<p>The above totals 400,000 yuan Total of 1,960,000 yuan</p>
<p>(Teams 36 to 394 are the Feng Shouzhi Public Memorial Team)</p>
<p>Yesterday, Bank of Communications, Lianyi Bank, and Yongxiang Money Shop approved a total of six teams, as described in the previous article. In addition, Taihexiang, Huang Zhendong, Fengji, Yuhua Tobacco Factory, New Asia Printing Factory, and Huachang Chemical Factory (the above three teams were solicited by Mr. Liu Jingchuan of Continental Advertising Company) each approved one team. The enthusiasm for helping students cannot be overstated. I hope that all industries in Shanghai will respond in unison, promote it in many ways, and donate generously, so that the more than 4,000 poor and outstanding young people will have the opportunity to continue their studies, and the society and country will benefit from it.</p>

<h3>China Youth Basketball Team Hosts Four-Team Showdown</h3>

<p>National Forum</p>
<h3>Preliminary Discussion on Improving National Medicine and Maintaining National Health</h3>
<p>— Ren</p>
<p>Since the war, medicine has almost become a privileged monopoly; the lower and middle classes, once selected for disease, initially delay in the hope of self-healing by chance, causing treatable diseases to become incurable. Or they use harmful and useless elixirs as a life bet, alas! If we were to statistically account the number of poverty-stricken citizens dying in vain, the figure would be certain to make one sigh!</p>
<p>If we look again at the national medicine community, which has the vocation of saving people, in addition to a portion being exploited by privileged groups due to historical or capital reasons, the plight of medical practitioners in rural areas is no better than that of elementary school teachers, and the sluggishness of pharmacies is beyond the understanding of outsiders. Why is this tragic situation of deformity and contradiction like this? Where does the crux lie? Let us briefly state the following:</p>
<p>(1) Poor people lose their productive capacity after falling ill, and the family's expenses and food are still indispensable. If they delay seeking medical treatment and taking medicine, it is impossible.</p>
<p>(2) Those medical practitioners who are at the peak of their careers raise their consultation fees to show their status, thereby limiting access. Therefore, the poor and sick will retreat in the face of such circumstances. Those with sluggish business are almost in a state of hidden poverty. If there are people seeking treatment, they will use quackery methods to defraud, in order to make up for the shortcomings in their business income. Thus, even if the poor and sick can raise money to respond, they can only do it once and not again.</p>
<p>The above two items are indeed the trend of a part of the national medical community, although there are also those who live up to their "benevolent heart and benevolent art," but they are ultimately a minority.</p>
<p>(3) The business of national pharmacies is originally more profitable than other national businesses. Those with large capital and long history are dedicated to serving the upper class, so they do not worry about declining business even if the prices are very high. (However, this is unique to cities and is ultimately a minority.) Most of them use inferior materials, or their facades are not magnificent, and they specialize in serving lower-class customers. Before the war, the price difference between large pharmacies and small pharmacies was more than half. To this day, there may still be this phenomenon in suburban areas. Taking Shanghai as an example, large pharmacies manipulate the industry association, and the marked prices must be uniform, so the poor and sick cannot afford it even more. If you look at the statistics of internal medicine and surgery seeking treatment from various charity groups that provide free diagnosis and medicine today, they can be equal. If only diagnosis is provided without medicine, only external diseases will be treated (because there are usually special medicines for external diseases), and internal medicine will be extremely few, all because the price of medicine is too high. This is not a rumor, but there is an example to cite!</p>
<p>With these three, the poor and sick groan and cry out, no longer like human beings, or they live for many years with illness, and there is no day for the nation's health to improve. The national medicine community also has no comprehensive development into a proper and bright state. But now that we know the cruel cause, is there no way to reverse it? Saying: No, we can treat the abuses! Preliminary discussions are as follows, for the reference of people from all walks of life and the authorities:</p>
<p>It must be known that sick families cannot afford medical treatment, but it is not that there are no doctors; doctors have no one seeking treatment, but it is not that there are no patients. Patients cannot afford medicine, but it is not that there are no pharmacies; pharmacies have sluggish business, but it is not that there are no patients. The key is to propose methods, namely free medical treatment and affordable dispensing of medicine.</p>
<p>Free medical treatment Investigate the number of medical practitioners, and assign them in proportion. For example, if a town has 1,000 households and 5 doctors, each doctor is responsible for treating the patients in 200 households (specify a certain time). If some of them can afford medical treatment on their own, they do not need to be treated at will. Or the doctors in this town can cooperate in one place for free diagnosis. It can also be done. Adapt to the time and place to seek convenience and benefits, and adapt to the situation. The consultation fee for doctors is hoped that the municipal authorities or local gentry will be responsible for it, and strive to adapt to the local living standards, otherwise abuses will definitely not be avoided.</p>
<p>Affordable dispensing of medicine The price of national medicine has recently increased by about 300% compared with the previous month. If we want to seek affordable dispensing of medicine, we do not need to rely on medicine dealers, but we hope that people from all walks of life and those who are enthusiastic about public welfare will establish affordable national medicine shops. The selling price must be more than half lower than ordinary national medicine (real money). Now, the cost of each catty of medicine in pharmacies is 100 yuan, and the selling price of each tael is also close to 100 yuan. Even if the processing, cutting, and other expenses are added, if people are used properly, there is still profit to be made. Since the price of medicine is cheap, there must be many civilians seeking dispensing. From this, we can predict that it will be easy to labor without spending, and the price of medicine can be controlled.</p>
<p>Social Services</p>
<h3>Enthusiastically Respond to Winter Relief</h3>
<p>(1) Mr. Lin Ruiting wrote in a letter: "Dear Editor, I previously handled the clearing of the accounts of Tongqing Money Shop, which has been closed after each shareholder paid up according to their shares. Now, Mr. Yu Zhendong, a shareholder, has handed over National Currency 50,000 yuan to Mr. Zhang Rongchu as my remuneration. I am afraid of offending his kindness, so I dare not refuse it firmly. I specially transferred this amount in Mr. Yu's name to assist your newspaper and the five religious groups in jointly organizing winter relief funds, so as to create blessings for Mr. Yu. This amount is entrusted to Mr. Wang Boyuan for transfer. Please collect it."</p>
<p>(2) Mr. Ying Yongyu, in order to support the winter relief in this newspaper, in addition to soliciting 20,000 yuan from Mr. Fang Zijun of Fuzhong Company, and other donations, he and his son, etc., saved money to assist in response, and the enthusiasm is admirable. He wrote in a letter: "I recently heard that your newspaper launched a campaign to provide porridge and clothes. Although I am a salary earner with not much income, I have a compassionate heart. I specially saved the cost of vegetables and meals, etc., and obtained 600 yuan in two days, and raised 2,400 yuan, totaling 3,000 yuan, which I will send to your office as winter relief funds, to fulfill the obligation of mutual assistance between human beings. I hope everyone will respond, gather a little to make a lot, and accumulate sand to form a tower, then the effect will be great. I especially hope that the wealthy and large merchants will save on medical expenses when they encounter birthdays, weddings, and festivals, and help the poor, then the merit of benefiting people and helping things will be small."</p>
<h3>Distribution of Food Certificates at Various Porridge Distribution Points</h3>
<p>In addition to entrusting various charities to distribute porridge at (1) World Military Porridge Factory, No. 180 Xiamen Road, (2) China Education Righteousness Association, No. 98 Fengyu Lane, Nantong Road, (3) Si Men Guandi Temple, (4) CaJiadu Bailinan Road Liuliu Lane No. 6 since the 10th of this month, we have recently added Pudong Dongchang Road District, Yangshupu Meizhou Roadkou Hudong Commune, and Huai'an Road Wuding Road Chengping Lane No. 25 Mingde Righteousness Association to distribute porridge, biscuits, and sweet potatoes and miscellaneous grains, etc. All are handled by the respective places for registration, distribution of food certificates, and queuing for food on a daily basis, and the order is quite good.</p>
<h3>Respond to Good Deeds</h3>
<p>(1) Funeral Expenses to Help Good Deeds Mr. Peng Zifeng, with morality and literature, was respected by the world. He was enthusiastic about public welfare and loved to do good throughout his life. Unfortunately, he passed away far away, and the old man passed away, which was a pity for those who heard about it. His son, Mr. Yousheng, collected 120,000 yuan in funeral expenses from relatives and friends and transferred it to charity. In addition to donating 10,000 yuan to this office's medical assistance fund for elementary school teachers, he also donated 100,000 yuan to the Nantong Road China Education Righteousness Association for porridge distribution, and 10,000 yuan to An Yang Nian Fo Tang, adding up to the above number. Mr. Zifeng's legacy is in the hearts of the people, and we are extremely admired.</p>
<p>(2) Pray for Blessings for Parents Mr. and Mrs. Gao Yi wrote in a letter: "Dear Editor, the 15th of the month is my son's first birthday. For the past year, due to the love of my son, I have experienced the kindness of my parents in raising and nurturing me. Therefore, I specially donated National Currency 10,000 yuan to your office's medical assistance fund to pray for blessings for my parents. Although the amount is small, it expresses my heart." Mr. and Mrs. Gao Yi, because of their love for their son and their thoughts of filial piety, are admirable.</p>
