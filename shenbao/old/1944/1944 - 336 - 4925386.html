<h3>日海空兩軍出動　撃沉敵驅艦兩艘　卡麥泰斯海附近詳細戰果</h3>
<p>菲島前綫日軍基地五日中央社電　日空海軍自十二月二日起，歷三日間，於卡麥泰斯海附近，擊沉敵驅逐艦二艘，詳細戰果如次：日航空部隊二日下午十一時餘，於卡麥泰斯海卡米　奧海峽附近，發見敵驅逐艦五艘正在北上，常即加以攻擊，其一艘並中彈發生大火，該驅逐艦其後即失航跡，故證實擊沉。據哨戒機之偵察，另一驅遂艦亦停止於波羅島東岸，實僅餘二艘北上，三日零時餘，日航空部隊及艦艇又出動攻擊，航空部隊之戰果雖未證實，然日軍驅逐艦已與敵艦交戰，擊毀其一艘，航空部隊更繼續攻擊殘餘之敵驅逐艦，遙見敵艦高吐白烟。</p>
<p>菲律賓五日中央社常敵魚雷艇及運輸船，爲擾亂日方補給綫，曾出現於菲律賓西方海面，故日空軍速日來特對之反復進攻，獲重大戰果，茲分誌於次：（一）日機二日夜會於卡麥泰斯海掃射敵小型運輸船，使之起火。（二）日機三日黎明曾於呂宋島附近擊沉敵小型運輸船一隻，嗣更發現大型魚雷艇一艘，即對之投彈，該艇因後部中彈，續行遁逃，但遭日機反復掃射，卒於波羅島附近沉沒。（三）日機一日夜曾攻擊卡里加拉灣之敵魚雷艇羣，擊沉撃毀其三艘。此外，更投彈命中其小型運輸船一艘，使之起炸。</p>
<h3>防衛東京上空　衝撞撃落敵機　日大本營發表殉職勇士</h3>
<p>東京五日中央社電　日大本營五日下午四時發表：十一月二十四日於東京附近，以衝撞擊落敵B29型機而壯烈戰死之陸軍伍長見田義雄及十二月三日衝撞敵機之陸軍中尉四之宮徹，陸軍軍曹澤本政美，陸軍伍長板坥政雄，均爲特別攻擊隊震天制空隊隊員。</p>
<h3>敵機襲日損失一百七十餘架</h3>
<p>東京五日中央社電　大東亞戰爭已滿三年，回顧此第三年之戰爭特色，爲敵軍於日方戰略圈中心之菲律賓島雷伊泰之登陸及本格空襲九州及東亞，自本年六月十六日轟炸九州以來，由成都飛出之B29型機隊，前後空製日本本土西部。十一月二十四日由馬里亞納方面而來之B29型機，自襲東京地區以來，迄今已歷四次，敵B29型機雖誇稱爲對日攻擊之新兵器，然成都。福岡間之二千二百公里，塞班·東京間之二千二百八十公里之距離，空襲日本實非易事，且成都與馬里亞納基地之地理條件，均已限制敵方所期者。中國方面因其空軍基地網設立之結果，成都已爲日軍機攻擊之目標。九月四日以來，已遭日機五次之製撃，毀敵大型機一百三十放架之多，敵機由成都轟炸九州，往復均須翔破日軍佔領下之中國上空，故常遭日機之遷擊及追擊，故敵機攻擊日本領土，其因難性實多。至於馬利亞納敵基地儘爲大小島嶼之集合，雖有收容B29型機二百架之能力，然其規模終不及中國方面者，且因相接小笠原列島之尖端，一故十一月三日以來，已受日機之五次攻擊，其四十架以上或被擊落，以上各種惡條件，而攻擊日本本土時，因地理關係，其情報常先達於日軍防衛中樞，完壁之邀擊態勢，瞬刻即可確立，故敵機損失率極大，且日本之損失，因軍官民一體之奮鬥，被害常常止於最小限度。檢討過去九州八次，東京四次之空襲，來襲敵機全數約達六百二十架，竟被日機整落其八十七架，擊毀八十五架以上，故敵機損失計被擊落者一成四，被擊毀者一成四，且此被擊毀之八十五架以上之敵機，絕難悉數安然突破二千餘公里之歸路，飛抵基地，擊滅B29型機一架，即可使其損失六十五萬美元生產費，與七萬工作時間，同時，最少亦可使其喪失十二名航空員。</p>
<h3>日陸省發表　人事更動</h3>
<p>東京五日中央社電　日陸軍省五日發表：陸軍少佐西尾常三部升陸軍大佐，陸軍少尉米澤芳太郎，柴田禎男升任陸軍大尉，陸軍准尉國重武夫，島村信夫升任陸軍中尉。</p>
<h3>日空挺隊突撃　收獲大戰果　以傳統精神衝殺敵陣</h3>
<p>東京五日中央社電　雷伊泰之日美決戰，在伯伊間戰局日趨激烈，敵美恃龐大之物量，日軍已予阻止。前有日軍神風特別攻擊隊必殺之衝撞，嗣又有陸軍特別攻擊隊必殺必死之攻擊，今又有中尉隊長率領之空挺隊，作空前未有之突擊壯舉。該空挺隊繼巴隣傍陸軍降落傘部隊之傳統精神，分乘運輸機於敵基地强行着陸，將飛機燒毀，駕駛負等一同殺抵敵陣，身懷炸彈，以傳統之突擊戰術擾亂敵陣，使其驚駭，冀隊旣出動，即不復返，向敵陣衝殺，即完全皇民化之台灣，朝鮮人，亦報皇恩，踴躍突人敵陣，舉全力打倒敵美，以求雷伊泰決勝之强力，已見於此矣。</p>
<p>菲律賓前綫日軍某基地五日中央社電　日薰空挺隊自勇敢突擊敵機塲後，即着着收獲相當之戰果，二日據日偵察機之偵察，布羅音機塲附近至此巳無敵機蹤跡，即塔拉克附近機塲數量亦見激減，可知　空挺隊所獲戰果之偉。惟敵小部隊的五十人離布羅音後，即竄攪塔加米南方，謀直迫日軍陣地，然日軍於二十八日獲悉此種情形後，即行先發制人，迂迥敵後，實施奇製，卒將其殲滅。另有　空隊勇士，亦曾於畫間潛身密林，並到處出擊奇襲敵軍，收獲戰果，似已使敵不寒而慄。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>電力合理分配</h3>
<p>上月二十三日，華中水電公司發表用電緊急辦法以後，聞已根據辦法第三項：「工廠用電力，一應全部停止供給，而考慮其軍需及民生安定上之重要程度，順次恢復供給。　逐漸將工廠用電，先行停止供給。</p>
<p>我們對於華中水電公司這一措置，爲適應決戰環境，自非得已，因此，在原則上無須再加批評。但在實施上就不能不希望得到最合理的分配，以期無礙於軍需及民生必需品工業生產。</p>
<p>怎樣才是最合理的分配呢？原則上就是嚴格規定軍需及民生必需品的項目，然後依照生產能率，緩急先後，順序規定供電數量。除此規定以外，一律停止供給，各工廠申請恢復供電時，水電公司當局自應依照規定項目，接受申請，如未在規定範圍內之工廠，根本不予接受申請，省却轉輾手續。同時，規定申請期間，逾期不再通融，在申請期間內，將應應予接受申請的工廠，對於生產能率，生產種類，作一通盤統計，然後估計發電能力，再作適當的分配此例。當然，這個分配比例的決定，完全基於客觀的需要，絕對公平，而毫不參以情感作用。因爲凡是徇情或者有了特殊的例外後，就不能達到絕對公平的目的。</p>
<p>其决，我們檢討過去的供電實况，雖則經過數次的減少與限制，但都是普遍的比例的減少，因此，分配興用途均不合理，分配方面，輕重之間不能適應，用途方面，則不免仍多浪費，譬如軍需及民生必需品的工業，因爲普遍減電以後，生產大受影響。而消耗品奢侈品的生產，如捲烟廠，玩具廠，化妝品廠，糖果廠等，縱已減電，減少生產，但生產成品，還是浪費消耗的。因爲目前是在大東亞戰爭決戰時期，國家興亡，民族生死，繫此緊要關頭，中國是參戰國家的一員，旣然不能參加前綫作戰，自應對於增强戰力的生產工作，特別有所貢獻。所以，第一是軍需生產，所有工廠，一半應轉變方向，改爲軍需品生產，電力當然照常供給。一半應爲民生必需品生產，所謂民生必需品自應限於戰時生活最低限度的需要而定。如果超越戰時生活的最低需要，而是滿足生活上高貴的享受，雖爲民生所需要，但並非必需品，也不在保留之列。</p>
<p>就是民生必需品工廠，而其生產品生產以後，並不立即以之應巿，作爲囤積待善價而沽者，這種工廠不能視作民生必需品工廠，也應停止供電，因爲電力供給愈多，愈是造成囤積居奇追求利的機會。所以，不得不予以制裁</p>
<p>最後，我們期望從這次供電辦法中，對於工廠供電，澈底調整，第一軍需，其决爲民生必需，其餘一律停止。雖爲民生必需而有囤積居奇者，亦隨時停電。這樣，不僅對於大東亞戰爭有所貢獻，同時，並可矯正社會奢靡風尚，防止囤積居奇，端在有關當局之善於運用機會而已。</p>
<h3>國民黨改組與國共合作（一）</h3>
<p>— 吉田東祐</p>
<p>問：你上月發表的「再論重慶政權」，一開頭就說過：「按最近形勢言，重慶大行改組的可能性非常濃厚」。老實說，當斯蒂威爾撤職時，尚認爲你的話是無的放矢，但今日國民黨的改組消息，業已發表，才覺得你的估計很正確。</p>
<p>答：你佩服這個地方，倒使我慚愧萬分！重慶政權將行改組，甚至英文晚報早已預言過了。然而多少可以讓你佩服的地方，就是我所指出的「重慶政權改組」的內容。我曾說過，未來重慶政權的改組，決不說是由於美國方面那樣「民主主義者的壓迫，而國粹派就沒落下去」的意思。試觀此次改組的內容，正如我所料，國粹派不僅沒有沒落，甚至反而可以說，國粹派的陣營更加充實和鞏固了。最主要的，就是何應欽仍然盤據着參謀總長的老巢。何應欽只把軍政部長的位置禪讓於陳誠，而自已仍保留着參謀總長的位置，這一事實，是頗令人玩味的。大家都曉得，去年蔣介石曾修改軍事委員會的軍程，而廢除副委員長制了。當然這不能單純着作是改變制度。因爲軍事委一員長蔣介石，萬一不幸一命嗚呼，則按章程，代理軍事委員長者，自然是副委員長。副委員長，是馮玉祥。如讓馮玉代理蔣介石，蔣介石也不高興，因爲不是嫡系。但按資格，又不能罷免馮玉祥，而讓何應欽當副委員長。於是煞費躊躇，而就決定腹一除副委員長制了。這樣一來，假如有一天軍事委員長蔣介石壽終正寢，自然參謀總長何應欽，就可名正言順地取蔣介石而代之。因此，何應欽此次沒有失掉參謀總長的位置，就是向美國表示，代理蔣介石者仍將是何應欽。</p>
<p>同時，如果把新任軍政部長陳誠，當作非國粹派，這也是不可否認的錯誤。陳誠這個人，應當以漢口陷落前後爲分水嶺，劃分着截然不同的兩個時期。他的抗日言論，曾被中共的「黨外政策」所利用，而成爲抗日宣傳的好資料。於是，他本身就被看作是國共合作的擁護者。他也曾利用這一廣大羣衆的愛戴，而造成了自己的勢力，甚至一個時期，都認爲蔣介石的繼承人將是陳誠。但自從漢口陷落前後起，國民黨就開始担憂如不改變局勢，則抗日戰爭的領導權就會落於中國共產黨之手。而自從CC團組織三民主義靑年團以來，國民黨就向中國共產黨宣佈「戰爭中的戰爭」了。該時期的陳誠，當然就被蔣介石和何應欽强迫，而對自巴前此的傾向作一淸算了。從此以後，陳誠又完全回到自己的老巢國粹派的反共陣營裏去了。然而他現在仍然和何應欽，張治中，顧祝同等輩，有大同小異之點。如果說中共賜與何應欽輩的稱號「頑固派」和國粹派是正確的，那末陳誠和胡宗南之流，就可以稱爲開明的國粹派了。小異，只有這一點。蔣介石任他爲軍政部長，固然一方面是重慶敷衍美國及中共而作的政府改組姿態，但另一方面也不過是蔣介石利用他的開明傾向，而對國粹派政府加一點新鮮味而已。提昇兪鴻鈞爲財政部長，多半也是同樣意義。兪鴻鈞是孔祥熙的部下，而兪鴻鈞的背後旣有自巴的「老頭子」孔祥機，自然此次改組，是否可以稱作改組，實大成問題。只是兪鴻鈞比孔祥熈稍有點新鮮味而已。蔣介石就是想利用這種新鮮味，來敷衍美國的改組要求，來加强國粹派政府，這就是蔣介石在政治上的「一箭雙鷗」政策。</p>
<p>陳立夫與朱家驊的對調，正如右眼球與左眼球的對調。這兩位仁兄，始終幹着CC團的合夥事業。CC團這一名詞的來源，本來是陳果夫和陳立夫兩個人姓Chen的頭一個字姆C的排列，但最近陳果夫因肺病不能起床，CC團的實際工作，全由陳立夫和朱家驊來擔任。所以現在一般人所說的CC團，已經是陳立夫的C和朱（Chu）家驊的C了。</p>
<p>我在一再論重慶政權」一文裏，曾說過國民黨或將改組，但「這決不長國粹派即將完全一　不振的意思。請不要忘記，蔣介石本人就是國粹派人物」。一般說來，此次改組正是證明我平常所說，重慶的國粹派勢力非常堅强，這是正確的，而他人認爲「重慶政權的外交，唯美京華盛頓的馬首是膽」，道是荒謬絕倫的。</p>
<p>間：不要自誇！不要目誇！</p>
<p>答：這並不是自誇。我認爲關於重慶政權的估計，日本的評論界水準，遠較現在的英美爲高。大東亞戰爭以前，日本有很多人五體投地地佩服賽眞珠的小說，斯諾，安德萊，根塞等人的論中國文章。不能不承認，他們的確克服了言語和文字的不通，而詳細地觀察了中國問題。然而他們還長沒脫了用「藍眼睛」觀察中國。「藍眼睛」，就是民主主義革命已經成功的國家之人民眼睛。這樣是不能理解目前中國細小瑣碎政治苦悶的。能理解中國的眞正苦悶者，只有曉得明治維新時代的苦悲之日本人。</p>
<p>：請暫且不談這個問題，至於重慶此次改組，美國和中國共產黨會因此而滿足麼？按新聞報道，美國好像還要求罷免何應欽的參謀總長官聯。</p>
<h3>貴州日軍　佔領八寨</h3>
<p>廣西前綫五日中央社電　進攻貴州之日軍，攻陷三合之快速部隊，二日下午四時，佔領八寨（都嶧東方三十公里，）刻賡續進抵寨厘叟。突入獨山中日軍，于荔波（獨山）東方五十公里）附近，大舉搜索渝十七集團軍之殘敗部隊中。</p>
<p>渝方大受威脅　里斯本五日中央社電　據美聯社駐重慶訪員訊，刻日軍已進至獨山，直綫距離去黔省首府貴最僅百二十餘公里，因之重慶政權在軍事上政治上，已感到作戰以來未曾有之重大威脅。衆認重慶是否崩潰，在今後兩月間當可決定。重慶軍在滇緬公路開通前，如不死守貴陽，則重慶勢必瀕於危殆。</p>
<p>日軍佔領獨山經過　獨山五日中央社電日軍快速部隊攻略南丹後，陸續急進，復將貴州省要衝獨山，完全佔據，茲誌其戰鬥經過如决：日軍攻略南丹後，即日指貴州而北進，上月三十日晨，衝破省境關口之六塞墟，突向貴州省城，迅速將獨山佔領。此期間渝軍兵力自桂林·柳州·敗退之第九十三軍第七十九軍，及第四十七軍與胡宗南麾下之第四十二師，總計的五萬。日軍在雲貴高原之重曡峯巒中，不眠不息，果敢前進，時自側面肉搏渝軍陣地，獲得莫大戰績。按獨山爲貴州全省最有力之據點，日軍佔領此地後，使渝美空軍之補給基地，又失一處。重慶及美軍因失却此地而受之打擊與威脅，實可謂大。</p>
<h3>日機猛襲各地機塲</h3>

<h3>蘇崑虞產米區視察記　（一）</h3>
<p>上海新聞記者鑒於目前亙古未有之高價的糧食問題，乃爲我國與我民所切身有關，且成爲戰爭決勝中重要因素之一，特組織產米區視察團，於上月廿五日啓程，赴江蘇省產米地帶，實地視察，歷經蘇州，崑山，常熟各地，費時一周，於本月一日返滬。</p>
<p>記者視察團於行前，曾提出四大問題：一，本年度糧食生產狀况？二，米糧收買進行如何？三，省府田賦實物徵收制予農民之影響？四，蘇省四大城市糧食配給制何日確立？於視察時期，深感所負責任之重大，無時無刻，無不以有謁首都中山陵上的指示：——「國以民爲本，民以食爲天」爲念，沿途不辭辛勞，冒雨深入農村，調查產米情况，即於趁船時間，亦邀請農民參加，舉行談話會，以不曠廢時間，儘量體騐農民之真實處境，以翔實報道於讀者之前。</p>
<p>記者團於視察告一段落間，國於蘇州，舉行座談會，就各團員考察所得，互相交換意見，現將此項紀錄加以補充，作爲視察團共同提供的報告書，分爲糧食收買·田賦·田租·配給·收成·合作社·農民生活·貪官汚吏諸綱領，分錄於後。</p>
<p>因時間短暫，地域不能遍及各處，視察或有不到之處，恐將使期待此文之官民，有所失望，不過，記者團撰文時，不過，記者團撰文時，以心胸所欲吐露之意見，盡量披局能根據此種意見，加以採納而改善，則記者團誠感無上的榮幸。</p>
<p>此行，承蒙中日地方長官以及與米糧收買有關之機構，懇切指示，特此誌謝。</p>
<p>一　米糧收買情况</p>
<p>（一）本年收買米糧特殊性格。</p>
<p>記者團於出發前，承米統會總部植田副主任委員，曾表示本年度米糧收買的特性，謂：「本年度米糧蒐買大綱。一·對特需與民需食米最爲重親，決維持最低量的戶口米配給制，同時維持配給之最低價格，業與國府市府共同協力。二·本年謶鋻於去年經騐，採用內地重點主義，特於江蘇省機構實踐蒐買方針，此點可實地視察者。三·本年席由軍連絡部爲主體，得各軍關係方面之協力，與省府極力支持。」</p>
<p>據視察所得，本年度米糧收買，在本質與前不同，有二點告訴牘者的：</p>
<p>第一：辦米的性質，正如米統會江蘇分辦事處貫操副主任所說：「過去米糧是商品，可是在大東亞戰爭後，米已不得再是單純的商品，而是完成大東亞戰爭，確保後方軍需民需的重要資源。」</p>
<p>第二：收質，據視察所得，此次收買進行，國府已動員軍，官·商·民·一致協力，不像去年似乎單純是米統會的職務，所以這次成功與否職務，所以這次成功與否，是官·民·上·下·共同的責任。</p>
<p>（二）收買米糧的機構</p>
<p>本年度收買機構，因爲採取內地重點主義，所以有新的改進，新的系統例表爲：</p>
<p>行政院，商統會，米統會，辦事處（如江蘇辦事處）地區辦事處，分辦事處，中日米糧公會。米商收買班，農民。</p>
<p>例如江蘇辦事處，是米統會以內地重點主義出發底強大實踐機構，於九月十日成立下區轄四地區辦事（蘇州·鎮江·松江·無錫）十六分辦事處（呈縣等十六縣）。</p>
<p>收買機構的人事方面，去年所有對米業外行者參加，這次是動員了優秀米業巨商擔任，像江蘇辦事處顧問陸季常（吳縣大米商）主任李仲臣（無錫老米商）副主任陳新傳（米統會的特派員）筧操（三夔洋行次長）常熟分辦事處主任狄格（大米行益興號店主）副主任山下部（增幸洋行）崑山分辦事處主任唐欽如（崑山老米商）副主任若林基一（迫田洋行）負責者無一不是對米糧採購具有經驗者，而足以領導中日各採買團體的。</p>
<p>職員的信仰，是根據米統會的誓文：一·我儕在此戰時負採辦糧食之任務，以貢獻大東亞戰爭之完成。二·我儕們農民辛苦所獲之結晶，應抱敬愛感謝之心，以謀最善之服務。三·我儕鑒於米糧爲一切之原動力，應覺以所負職責之重大，與名譽之崇高。四·我儕棄私心，戳力從公，使中日提携之真姿充分暴露。</p>
<p>米統會下層機構的一個職員，向記者團發表心境：「從事收買貪米工作，我日夜的記着總會的四條誓文，依靠着這信念，挺身服務，等於參加戰爭的戰士，我不曾忘記九月十日軍發局的訓詞中，說起今年收買米就是作戰，在這大前提下，我也是無時無刻忘不了農民的辛苦。」</p>
<p>（三）實地收買食米工作</p>
<p>這次米統會的收買食米進行，在治安良好的地方採取「分擔制」（利用團府保甲機構，登記存儲食米，以便供給），以其他地方是採取收買制；關於各地的收怒頓個，在崑山是採取分擔制的，採辦的，有採商，有合作社；在常熟進行收買工作擔當的，有採辦商公會，有米業公會，有合作社，有新成立的田業公會。</p>
<p>進行的情况，據江蘇辦事處發表：「江蘇地區於十月下旬開始收買，預定於明年一月爲收買最旺成盛期，十月底至十一月初，天氣陰霾，微雨綿綿妨礙晨作物，使蓮斜倒，根部纖維腐化，認近數日，天氣明朗，一百七十餘米商，進行如火如荼的收買工作。」</p>

<h3>The Japanese Navy and Air Force Mobilize: Two Enemy Destroyer Vessels Sunk; Detailed Battle Results Near Camotes Sea</h3>
<p>Central News Agency report from the Japanese army base on the front lines of the Philippines, dated the 5th: The Japanese Navy and Air Force, over the course of three days starting December 2nd, sank two enemy destroyer vessels near the Camotes Sea. The detailed battle results are as follows: On the afternoon of December 2nd, at around 11:00 PM, Japanese air units discovered five enemy destroyer vessels heading north near the Camotes Sea's Camiguin Channel. They immediately attacked, and one vessel was hit and caught fire. That destroyer subsequently disappeared from radar, thus confirming its sinking. According to reconnaissance by patrol planes, another destroyer was also stopped on the eastern shore of Polillo Island, leaving only two vessels heading north. At around 0:00 AM on the 3rd, Japanese air units and naval vessels again mobilized to attack. While the results of the air units' attacks were not confirmed, Japanese destroyers engaged the enemy vessels, destroying one of them. The air units continued to attack the remaining enemy destroyers, remotely witnessing one of the enemy vessels emitting white smoke.</p>
<p>Central News Agency report from the Philippines, dated the 5th: Enemy torpedo boats and transport ships have been appearing in the western sea areas of the Philippines, disturbing Japanese supply lines. Therefore, the Japanese Air Force has been repeatedly attacking them, achieving significant battle results, which are detailed as follows: (1) On the night of the 2nd, Japanese aircraft strafed enemy small transport ships in the Camotes Sea, causing them to catch fire. (2) At dawn on the 3rd, Japanese aircraft sank an enemy small transport ship near Luzon Island. Subsequently, a large torpedo boat was discovered, and bombs were dropped on it. The torpedo boat's rear was hit, and it attempted to escape, but it was repeatedly strafed by Japanese aircraft and eventually sank near Polillo Island. (3) On the night of the 1st, Japanese aircraft attacked a group of enemy torpedo boats in Carigara Bay, sinking and destroying three of them. In addition, bombs hit one of their small transport ships, causing it to explode.</p>
<h3>Defending Tokyo's Skies: Ramming and Shooting Down Enemy Aircraft; Japanese Imperial Headquarters Announces Sacrificed Heroes</h3>
<p>Central News Agency report from Tokyo, dated the 5th: The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on the 5th: On November 24th, near Tokyo, Army Corporal Yoshio Mita heroically sacrificed himself by ramming and shooting down an enemy B-29 aircraft. On December 3rd, Army Lieutenant Toru Shinomiya, Army Sergeant Masami Sawamoto, and Army Corporal Masao Itabaki also rammed enemy aircraft. All were members of the Special Attack Force "Shinten Seiku-tai" (Earth-Shaking Sky Control Unit).</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Attacking Japan Suffer Losses of Over 170 Planes</h3>
<p>Central News Agency report from Tokyo, dated the 5th: Three years have passed since the start of the Greater East Asia War. Looking back at the characteristics of this third year, the enemy army landed on Leyte Island in the Philippines, the center of the Japanese strategic circle, and launched full-scale air raids on Kyushu and East Asia. Since the bombing of Kyushu on June 16th of this year, B-29 aircraft squadrons flying from Chengdu have repeatedly attacked western Japan. Since November 24th, B-29 aircraft coming from the Mariana Islands have attacked the Tokyo area four times so far. Although the enemy B-29 aircraft are touted as a new weapon for attacking Japan, the distances of 2,200 kilometers between Chengdu and Fukuoka, and 2,280 kilometers between Saipan and Tokyo, make air raids on Japan no easy task. Furthermore, the geographical conditions of both Chengdu and the Mariana bases have limited what the enemy can achieve. As a result of the establishment of their air base network in China, Chengdu has become a target for Japanese aircraft. Since September 4th, it has been attacked by Japanese aircraft five times, destroying as many as 130 enemy large aircraft. Enemy aircraft bombing Kyushu from Chengdu must travel over Chinese territory occupied by the Japanese army on their round trips, and therefore are often subjected to attacks and pursuits by Japanese aircraft. Thus, there are many difficulties involved in enemy aircraft attacking Japanese territory. As for the enemy base in the Mariana Islands, it is merely a collection of small islands. Although it has the capacity to accommodate 200 B-29 aircraft, its scale is ultimately not as large as the base in China. Furthermore, because it is adjacent to the tip of the Ogasawara Islands, it has been attacked by Japanese aircraft five times since November 3rd, with 40 or more aircraft having been shot down. Due to these various unfavorable conditions, the Japanese military's defense center often receives advance information about attacks on the Japanese mainland due to geographical relations, and a perfect interception posture can be established instantly. Therefore, the enemy aircraft's loss rate is extremely high. Furthermore, due to the united efforts of Japanese military personnel and civilians, the damage is often kept to a minimum. Reviewing the eight air raids on Kyushu and four air raids on Tokyo in the past, approximately 620 enemy aircraft came, and 87 were shot down by Japanese aircraft, and over 85 were destroyed. Therefore, enemy aircraft losses are calculated as 14% shot down and 14% destroyed. It is extremely difficult for those 85 or more destroyed enemy aircraft to safely navigate the 2,000+ kilometer return journey and reach their base. Destroying one B-29 aircraft means making the enemy lose $650,000 in production costs and 70,000 man hours of work. At the same time, it also means losing at least twelve airmen.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Ministry Announces Personnel Changes</h3>
<p>Central News Agency report from Tokyo, dated the 5th: The Japanese Army Ministry announced on the 5th: Army Major Tsunasaburo Nishio promoted to Army Colonel, Army Second Lieutenant Yoshitaro Yonezawa and Sadao Shibata promoted to Army Captain, Army Warrant Officer Takeo Kunishige and Nobuo Shimamura promoted to Army Lieutenant.</p>
<h3>Japanese Paratroopers Launch Surprise Attack, Achieving Great Battle Results; Charging into Enemy Lines with Traditional Spirit</h3>
<p>Central News Agency report from Tokyo, dated the 5th: The decisive battle between Japan and the United States on Leyte, in the area between Burauen, is becoming increasingly fierce. The enemy is relying on its massive material strength, which the Japanese army is preventing. First, there was the suicide ramming of the Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Force. Then, there was the must-win, must-die attack of the Army Special Attack Force. Now, there is the unprecedented, surprise attack feat of a paratrooper unit led by a lieutenant. This paratrooper unit, inheriting the traditional spirit of the Palembang Army Parachute Brigade, forcibly landed transport aircraft at enemy airfields, burned the aircraft, and charged into enemy lines along with the pilots, etc. Carrying bombs and using traditional surprise attack tactics, they disrupted the enemy lines, causing them to be terrified. Once the unit mobilized, they did not return, but charged into enemy lines. Even completely Japanized Taiwanese and Koreans repaid the Emperor's grace, eagerly rushing into enemy lines and doing their utmost to defeat the enemy Americans in order to strengthen the decisive battle on Leyte. This can already be seen.</p>
<p>Central News Agency report from a certain Japanese army base on the front lines of the Philippines, dated the 5th: Since the brave surprise attack on enemy airfields by the Japanese Kaoru Paratrooper Unit, they have steadily achieved considerable battle results. On the 2nd, according to reconnaissance by Japanese aircraft, there were no enemy aircraft traces near the Burauen airfield, and the number of aircraft at airfields near Tacloban had also drastically decreased. This demonstrates the greatness of the battle results achieved by the paratrooper unit. However, a small enemy unit of 50 men left Burauen and scurried south of Tagami, plotting to directly approach the Japanese army's positions. However, after the Japanese army learned of this situation on the 28th, they took pre-emptive action, circumventing the enemy's rear and implementing a surprise attack, eventually annihilating them. Furthermore, brave soldiers of the Kaoru Paratrooper Unit also concealed themselves in dense forests during the daytime, and launched surprise attacks on enemy troops everywhere, achieving battle results that seem to have caused the enemy to tremble with fear.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Rational Distribution of Electricity</h3>
<p>Last month, on the 23rd, the Central China Hydroelectric Company announced emergency measures for electricity usage. It is said that, according to Item 3 of the measures: "The electricity supply to all factories will be completely stopped. Supply will be restored sequentially, considering the importance of factories to military needs and the stability of people's livelihood." The electricity supply to factories will be gradually stopped first.</p>
<p>We believe that this measure by the Central China Hydroelectric Company is unavoidable in order to adapt to the decisive battle environment. Therefore, in principle, there is no need to criticize it further. However, in implementation, we cannot help but hope for the most rational distribution, so as not to hinder the production of military supplies and daily necessities.</p>
<p>What is the most rational distribution? In principle, it is to strictly define the items of military supplies and daily necessities, and then, according to production efficiency, urgency, and priority, sequentially stipulate the amount of electricity to be supplied. Supply should be stopped to all other items. When factories apply to restore electricity supply, the authorities of the hydroelectric company should accept applications in accordance with the specified items. Factories not within the specified scope should not be accepted at all, saving tedious procedures. At the same time, a deadline should be set for applications, and no further consideration should be given after the deadline. During the application period, a comprehensive statistical survey should be conducted on the production efficiency and types of products of the factories that should be accepted. Then, the power generation capacity should be estimated, and an appropriate distribution ratio should be made. Of course, the decision on this distribution ratio should be based entirely on objective needs, be absolutely fair, and not be influenced by emotion. Because any favoritism or special exceptions will prevent the achievement of absolute fairness.</p>
<p>In the past, when we reviewed the actual situation of electricity supply, although there have been several reductions and restrictions, they have all been universal proportional reductions. Therefore, the distribution and use are unreasonable. In terms of distribution, the balance between importance and unimportance cannot be adapted. In terms of use, there is still much waste. For example, the production of military supplies and daily necessities has been greatly affected because of the universal power reduction. The production of consumables and luxury goods, such as cigarette factories, toy factories, cosmetic factories, candy factories, etc., although their electricity has been reduced and production decreased, the production of finished products is still wasteful. Because we are currently in the decisive period of the Greater East Asia War, the rise and fall of the nation and the life and death of the people are tied to this critical juncture. China is a member of the participating countries, and since it cannot participate in frontline combat, it should make special contributions to strengthening war production. Therefore, the first priority is military supply production. Half of all factories should change direction and switch to military supply production, and electricity should of course be supplied as usual. Half should be for the production of daily necessities. The so-called daily necessities should be limited to the minimum needs of wartime life. If it exceeds the minimum needs of wartime life, and instead satisfies noble enjoyment in life, although it is needed by the people's livelihood, it is not a necessity, and is not in the list of things to be preserved.</p>
<p>Even for daily necessities factories, if their products are not immediately sold on the market after production, but are hoarded to wait for a good price, such factories cannot be regarded as daily necessities factories and should also have their electricity supply stopped. Because the more electricity supplied, the more opportunities there are to create hoarding and seek profits. Therefore, it is necessary to sanction them.</p>
<p>Finally, we hope that this electricity supply measure will thoroughly adjust the electricity supply to factories. First, military supplies; second, daily necessities; and all others should have their electricity stopped. Even those that produce daily necessities but engage in hoarding should have their electricity cut off at any time. In this way, not only will it contribute to the Greater East Asia War, but it can also correct social extravagance and prevent hoarding. It all depends on the authorities' ability to seize the opportunity.</p>
<h3>Reorganization of the Kuomintang and Cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party (I)</h3>
<p>— Toshio Yoshida</p>
<p>Question: At the beginning of your "Revisiting the Chongqing Regime" published last month, you said, "According to the latest situation, the possibility of a major reorganization of the Chongqing regime is very high." To be honest, when Stilwell was dismissed, I still thought your words were nonsense, but now that the news of the Kuomintang's reorganization has been announced, I feel that your assessment was very accurate.</p>
<p>Answer: Your admiration makes me feel ashamed! The Chongqing regime's upcoming reorganization, and even the English evening paper had already predicted it. However, what may be worth admiring is the content of the "Chongqing regime reorganization" that I pointed out. I said that the future reorganization of the Chongqing regime will definitely not be due to the "oppression of democrats from the American side, causing the decline of the national essence faction." Looking at the content of this reorganization, just as I expected, the national essence faction not only has not declined, but it can even be said that the national essence faction's camp has become more substantial and consolidated. The most important thing is that He Yingqin still occupies the old nest of the Chief of Staff. He Yingqin only ceded the position of Minister of Military Affairs to Chen Cheng, but retained the position of Chief of Staff himself. This fact is quite intriguing. Everyone knows that Chiang Kai-shek modified the regulations of the Military Commission last year and abolished the position of Deputy Chairman. Of course, this cannot be simply regarded as a change in the system. Because if Chiang Kai-shek, the chairman of the Military Commission, were to unfortunately die, according to the regulations, the person who would act as the chairman of the Military Commission would naturally be the deputy chairman. The deputy chairman was Feng Yuxiang. If Feng Yuxiang were allowed to act as Chiang Kai-shek's replacement, Chiang Kai-shek would not be happy, because he was not a direct descendant. But according to qualifications, he could not dismiss Feng Yuxiang and let He Yingqin be the deputy chairman. So, after much hesitation, he decided to abolish the deputy chairman system. In this way, if one day Chairman of the Military Commission Chiang Kai-shek were to pass away, naturally Chief of Staff He Yingqin could rightfully replace Chiang Kai-shek. Therefore, He Yingqin's failure to lose the position of Chief of Staff this time is to show the United States that the person who will act as Chiang Kai-shek's replacement will still be He Yingqin.</p>
<p>At the same time, if the newly appointed Minister of Military Affairs Chen Cheng is regarded as a non-national essence faction, this is also an undeniable mistake. Chen Cheng should be divided into two distinct periods, with the fall of Hankou as the dividing line. His anti-Japanese remarks were used by the Chinese Communist Party's "non-Party policy" and became good material for anti-Japanese propaganda. As a result, he himself was seen as a supporter of Kuomintang-Communist cooperation. He also used this widespread support to create his own power, and for a time, it was thought that Chiang Kai-shek's successor would be Chen Cheng. But since around the fall of Hankou, the Kuomintang began to worry that if the situation was not changed, the leadership of the anti-Japanese war would fall into the hands of the Chinese Communist Party. And since the CC Clique organized the Three People's Principles Youth League, the Kuomintang declared a "war within a war" against the Chinese Communist Party. During that period, Chen Cheng was of course forced by Chiang Kai-shek and He Yingqin to make a clear break with his previous tendencies. From then on, Chen Cheng completely returned to his old nest, the anti-communist camp of the national essence faction. However, he now still has similarities and differences with He Yingqin, Zhang Zhizhong, Gu Zhutong, and others. If the title of "stubborn faction" and national essence faction bestowed upon He Yingqin and his cohorts by the CCP is correct, then Chen Cheng and Hu Zongnan can be called the enlightened national essence faction. The difference is only this point. Chiang Kai-shek's appointment of him as Minister of Military Affairs is of course partly a government reorganization gesture made by Chongqing to appease the United States and the CCP, but on the other hand, it is only Chiang Kai-shek using his enlightened tendencies to add a bit of freshness to the national essence faction government. The promotion of Yu Hongjun to Minister of Finance is mostly the same meaning. Yu Hongjun is a subordinate of Kong Xiangxi, and Yu Hongjun's backer is the "old man" Kong Xiangxi. Naturally, whether this reorganization can be called a reorganization is highly questionable. It's just that Yu Hongjun is slightly fresher than Kong Xiangxi. Chiang Kai-shek wants to use this freshness to appease the American reorganization requirements and strengthen the national essence faction government. This is Chiang Kai-shek's "one arrow, two eagles" policy in politics.</p>
<p>The exchange between Chen Lifu and Zhu Jiahua is like the exchange between the right eyeball and the left eyeball. These two brothers have always been engaged in the joint business of the CC Clique. The source of the term CC Clique was originally the arrangement of the initial letter C of the surname Chen of Chen Guofu and Chen Lifu, but recently Chen Guofu has been unable to get out of bed due to lung disease, and the actual work of the CC Clique is entirely undertaken by Chen Lifu and Zhu Jiahua. So, the CC Clique that people generally refer to now is already the C of Chen Lifu and the C of Zhu Jiahua.</p>
<p>In my article "Revisiting the Chongqing Regime" repeatedly, I said that the Kuomintang may be reorganized, but "this will definitely not mean that the national essence faction will completely collapse." Please do not forget that Chiang Kai-shek himself is a national essence faction figure." Generally speaking, this reorganization proves that what I usually say is correct, that the strength of the Chongqing's national essence faction is very strong, and that others believe that "Chongqing regime's diplomacy obeys the United States of Washington" is absurd.</p>
<p>Question: Don't boast! Don't boast!</p>
<p>Answer: This is not boasting. I believe that the Japanese commentary circle's level of assessment of the Chongqing regime is far higher than that of the current British and American circles. Before the Greater East Asia War, many Japanese people admired Snow, Andre Malraux, Agnes Smedley and others' essays on China. It must be admitted that they did overcome the barrier of language and script, and observed the Chinese problem in detail. However, they have not yet shed the "blue eyes" observation of China. "Blue eyes" are the eyes of the people of countries where the democratic revolution has already succeeded. This cannot understand the petty and trivial political distress of China today. The only ones who can understand China's true distress are the Japanese who know the bitterness of the Meiji Restoration era.</p>
<p>Question: Please don't talk about this problem for now. Will the United States and the Chinese Communist Party be satisfied with this Chongqing reorganization? According to news reports, the United States seems to be demanding the dismissal of He Yingqin's position as Chief of Staff.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Occupies Bazhai in Guizhou</h3>
<p>Central News Agency report from the Guangxi front lines, dated the 5th: The Japanese army advancing into Guizhou, the rapid unit that captured Sanhe, occupied Bazhai (30 kilometers east of Duyun) at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd and is continuing to advance to Zhaisou. The Japanese army that broke into Dushan is conducting large-scale searches for the remnants of the 17th Army Group in the vicinity of Libo (50 kilometers east of Dushan).</p>
<p>Chongqing Greatly Threatened: Central News Agency report from Lisbon, dated the 5th: According to the Associated Press correspondent in Chongqing, the Japanese army has advanced to Dushan, only 120 kilometers in a straight line from Guiyang, the capital of Guizhou Province. As a result, the Chongqing regime has felt an unprecedentedly serious military and political threat since the start of the war. It is widely believed that whether Chongqing will collapse will be determined in the next two months. If the Chongqing army does not defend Guiyang to the death before the opening of the Burma Road, Chongqing will inevitably be in dire straits.</p>
<p>The Process of the Japanese Army Occupying Dushan: Central News Agency report from Dushan, dated the 5th: After capturing Nandan, the rapid units of the Japanese army advanced rapidly and successively, and completely occupied Dushan, a key point in Guizhou Province. The battle process is described as follows: After capturing Nandan, the Japanese army immediately pointed toward Guizhou and advanced north. On the morning of the 30th of last month, they broke through the Liusai Market, the gateway to the provincial border, and suddenly occupied Dushan, the provincial capital of Guizhou. During this period, the Chongqing army's troop strength consisted of the 93rd Army and 79th Army retreating from Guilin and Liuzhou, and the 47th Army and the 42nd Division under Hu Zongnan, totaling 50,000 troops. The Japanese army, without rest, advanced bravely in the overlapping mountains of the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, and often engaged in close-quarters combat on the flanks of the Chongqing army's positions, achieving great battle results. Dushan is the most powerful stronghold in Guizhou Province. After the Japanese army occupied this place, they lost another supply base for the Chongqing-American air force. The blow and threat suffered by Chongqing and the American army due to the loss of this place can be described as great.</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Fiercely Attack Airfields in Various Locations</h3>
<p>Central News Agency report from the mainland base, dated the 4th: Japanese bomber squadrons fiercely attacked airfields in Ganzhou, Laohekou, Suichuan, and other places on the evening of the 3rd, and all returned safely to base. The battle results are recorded as follows: Three locations in Ganzhou caught fire and burned (two of which seemed to be airfields). The battle results in Laohekou could not be confirmed due to poor communication lines.</p>
<h3>Japanese Greater East Asia General Headquarters Decides on Movement Policies</h3>
<p>Central News Agency report from Tokyo, dated the 5th: The Greater East Asia General Headquarters of the Japanese Imperial Rule Assistance Association held a Greater East Asia Cooperation Conference in Tokyo on the 4th and decided on the following movement policies: (1) Temporarily focus on China. (2) Thoroughly spread the spirit of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. (3) Strengthen the cooperative situation of various Greater East Asian peoples in their efforts in the Greater East Asia War. Liaison agencies will be established in three key areas within the Greater East Asia region and in various parts of Japan that have close ties with the Greater East Asia region. Furthermore, Japanese expatriates and indigenous people in various parts of Greater East Asia who have experience and enthusiasm for the movement to promote the army, or intellectuals, must actively cooperate in the implementation of the Greater East Asia movement.</p>

They immediately embarked on a do-or-die journey and approached the target airspace near dusk. Despite the enemy's rain of bullets, they dared to ram the enemy fleet and immediately sank an enemy warship. Their brilliant achievements will be celebrated for all ages. These members were incomparably loyal and brave, demonstrating their thorough devotion to the great cause. They are worthy of being models for the entire army. A citation is specially awarded to demonstrate our encouragement."</p>
<h3>Inspector Commissioners' Meeting Held Yesterday in Beijing; Attendees Report on Work Overview</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency) – The inaugural meeting of the First Session of Provincial and Municipal Inspector Commissioners convened by the Ministry of Interior was held in the auditorium of the Ministry of Interior. It was personally presided over by Minister of Interior Mei Siping. Attendees included the heads of the political affairs departments of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Huai provinces, the secretaries-general of the Shanghai and Beijing municipal governments, inspector commissioners from various districts, as well as heads of various divisions and sections of the Ministry of Interior, secretaries, counselors, inspectors, representatives from relevant agencies, Chen Che, secretary of the Ministry of Finance, Xue Yinzen, director of the Ministry of Education, Liang Pingyuan, counselor of the Ministry of Industry, Bu Yu, director of the Ministry of Construction, and Tong Yumin, director of the Rural Construction Committee, totaling over fifty people. Vice President Zhou of the Executive Yuan made a special visit to deliver instructions.</p>
<p>At precisely 9:00 AM, the opening ceremony of the conference began, with formalities observed. After paying silent tribute to the portrait of the late Chairman, Chairman Mei, the Minister of Interior, reported on the significance of the meeting. Following the report, Vice President Zhou was respectfully invited to deliver instructions, speaking with utmost sincerity for twenty minutes. A group photo was then taken to mark the occasion.</p>
<p>After the opening ceremony, the first meeting was convened at precisely 10:00 AM, still presided over by Minister Mei. Those present included Secretary-General Cai Bingxiang of the assembly, Deputy Secretary-General Zhong Wensuo, and over forty others. First, Secretary-General Cai Bingxiang reported that the assembly had received 125 proposals, with 45 attendees and those excused from attending. Following the report, Du Zheshu, Xiang Xun, Xie Shenfu, Wang Tianmu, Shi Linsen, Yan Degui, Ye Zhendong, Zhang Beisheng, and Mao Pufan, commissioners from various districts of Jiangsu Province, successively stood up to report on the general situation of work in their respective districts, providing very detailed reports. Subsequently, Zhou Huaru and Kuang Yunwen, commissioners of the first and second districts of Shanghai Special Municipality, reported on the general situation of work in their respective districts, concluding at 12:00 PM. At this point, the first meeting came to a close, with all attendees taking a break for lunch.</p>
<p>Minister of Interior Reports on the Significance of the Meeting Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency) – Minister Mei reported, in brief, that the significance of this meeting could be summarized in two points: The first point could be considered an expanded briefing. In the past, although the central government received reports from the commissioner's offices of various provinces and cities, as well as reports from the governments of various provinces and cities, the commissioners or heads of political affairs in various provinces and cities may not have fully understood each other. This meeting provides an opportunity for the central government to understand the situation in various regions, and for the commissioners of various regions to understand the situation in other regions, to help each other, and to discuss matters together. This is the first significance of this meeting. The second point is self-examination. The current system of inspector commissioners is different from the Daoyin system in the early Republic, and also different from the commissioner system before the Incident (likely refers to the Marco Polo Bridge Incident). The inspector commissioner system has been implemented for nearly half a year. The experience gained by each commissioner in the past six months can be reviewed at this meeting. The central government and the governments of various provinces and cities can also take this opportunity to review whether the inspector system is perfect and discuss how to strengthen the inspector system in the future. This is the second significance of the meeting, and so on.</p>
<p>Key Points of Vice President Zhou's Instructions Vice President Zhou's instructions stated, in brief, that the central government has high expectations for this meeting, hoping that all commissioners, based on past experience, can report truthfully and learn from each other. On the one hand, discuss practical solutions, and on the other hand, discuss how to promote the commissioner system. In my opinion, the quality of the inspector system depends entirely on how it is used. Therefore, today I have a few suggestions on how to use it: First, the system itself must be sound. Second, when commissioners inspect various places, they should observe with a fair and objective attitude. Third, if the funding of the commissioner's office is insufficient or there are other difficulties, they can request the central government to resolve them and must never solicit funds from the local area.</p>
<p>Afternoon Meeting Continues Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency) – The inaugural meeting of the Provincial and Municipal Inspector Commissioners convened by the Ministry of Interior concluded its morning session. After lunch, the meeting continued at 2:00 PM in the same venue, presided over by Minister Mei. The inspector commissioners from various districts of Huaihai Province reported on the general situation of important work in their respective districts and the counties under their jurisdiction. Subsequently, the inspector commissioners from various districts of Zhejiang Province reported on the general situation of important work in their respective districts and the counties under their jurisdiction. Subsequently, the inspector commissioners from various districts of Anhui Province reported on the general situation of important work in their respective districts and the counties under their jurisdiction.</p>
<p>At this point, the reports from the commissioners of all provinces and cities were completed. Chairman Mei Siping of the assembly stood up to report that, regarding the issue of public security, one must not be afraid of small local areas or financial difficulties, and that the personnel and other aspects must be sound, expanding from two or three counties to the entire region, and then to the entire province. He expressed the hope that good solutions could be discussed and offered to the central government for reference. Subsequently, Secretary-General Cai Bingxiang of the assembly reported on the matters needing attention for the proposal review meetings of each group tomorrow (the 6th) and the informal talks in the afternoon, with the closing ceremony scheduled for the 7th. The meeting concluded at around 6:00 PM. Furthermore, the assembly is scheduled to hold proposal review meetings for each group on the morning of the 6th and informal talks in the afternoon, with the closing ceremony scheduled for the 7th.</p>

<h3>Record of Su Kunyu's Inspection of Rice-Producing Areas (1)</h3>
<p>Shanghai news reporters, recognizing that the current unprecedented high price of food is closely related to our country and our people and has become an important factor in determining the outcome of the war, organized an inspection team for rice-producing areas. On the 25th of last month, they set off for the rice-producing areas of Jiangsu Province to conduct on-the-ground inspections. They traveled through Suzhou, Kunshan, Changshu, and other places, spending a week, and returned to Shanghai on the 1st of this month.</p>
<p>Before the reporters' inspection team set off, they raised four major questions: 1. What is the status of grain production this year? 2. How is the rice purchase proceeding? 3. What is the impact of the provincial government's in-kind grain tax collection system on farmers? 4. When will the grain rationing system be established in the four major cities of Jiangsu Province? During the inspection period, they deeply felt the weight of their responsibilities. At every moment, they kept in mind the instructions from their visit to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's mausoleum in the capital: "The people are the foundation of the country, and food is the people's heaven." Along the way, they did not hesitate to work hard, braving the rain to go deep into the countryside to investigate the rice production situation. Even during their time on the boat, they invited farmers to participate in discussion sessions, in order to not waste time and to experience the farmers' real situation as much as possible, so as to report truthfully to the readers.</p>
<p>When the reporters' team reached a break in the inspection, they held a symposium in Suzhou to exchange opinions on the findings of each team member's investigation. Now, this record is supplemented and used as a joint report provided by the inspection team, divided into the following categories: grain purchase, land tax, land rent, rationing, harvest, cooperative, farmer life, and corrupt officials.</p>
<p>Due to the short time and the inability to cover all areas, there may be inadequacies in the inspection, which may disappoint officials and citizens who expect this article. However, when the reporters' team wrote the article, they tried to express their opinions as much as possible, hoping that the authorities could adopt and improve based on these opinions. If so, the reporters' team would feel extremely honored.</p>
<p>During this trip, we received sincere guidance from local Chinese and Japanese officials and institutions related to rice purchases. We would like to express our gratitude here.</p>
<p>1. Rice Purchase Situation</p>
<p>(1) Special Characteristics of This Year's Rice Purchase.</p>
<p>Before the reporters' team set off, Deputy Director Ueda of the Rice Control Association headquarters stated the characteristics of this year's rice purchase, saying: "This year's rice purchase outline: 1. The most important thing is to meet the special needs and the people's need for food rice. We are determined to maintain the minimum amount of household rice rationing system and at the same time maintain the minimum price of rationing. We are working together with the national government and municipal government. 2. This year, based on last year's experience, we adopted the inland focus policy, especially implementing the purchase policy in Jiangsu Province. This point can be inspected on the ground. 3. This year, the military liaison department is the main body, with the cooperation of various military-related parties and the strong support of the provincial government."</p>
<p>According to the inspection, this year's rice purchase is different in nature from the past. There are two points to tell the readers:</p>
<p>First: The nature of rice handling, as Deputy Director Guan Cao of the Jiangsu office of the Rice Control Association said: "In the past, rice was a commodity, but after the Greater East Asia War, rice can no longer be a simple commodity, but an important resource for completing the Greater East Asia War and ensuring military and civilian needs in the rear."</p>
<p>Second: The purchase quality, according to the inspection, this purchase is being carried out with the joint efforts of the government, military, officials, merchants, and people. Unlike last year, when it seemed to be simply the duty of the Rice Control Association, the success or failure this time is the common responsibility of officials, people, superiors, and subordinates.</p>
<p>(2) Rice Purchase Organizations</p>
<p>This year's purchasing organizations have been newly improved and have a new system example table because they adopted the inland focus policy:</p>
<p>Executive Yuan, Commercial Control Association, Rice Control Association, offices (such as the Jiangsu office), regional offices, branch offices, China-Japan Rice Association. Rice merchant purchase team, farmers.</p>
<p>For example, the Jiangsu Office is a powerful implementation organization of the Rice Control Association starting from the inland focus policy. It was established on September 10 and has jurisdiction over four regional offices (Suzhou, Zhenjiang, Songjiang, Wuxi) and sixteen branch offices (Cheng County and sixteen other counties).</p>
<p>In terms of personnel in purchasing organizations, those who were unfamiliar with the rice industry in the past participated. This time, outstanding giant rice merchants were mobilized to take on the roles, such as Jiangsu Office Advisor Lu Jichang (a large rice merchant in Wuxian), Director Li Zhongchen (an old rice merchant in Wuxi), Deputy Director Chen Xinchuan (a special commissioner of the Rice Control Association), Jian Cao (deputy manager of Sankui Foreign Firm), Changshu Branch Director Di Ge (owner of the large rice firm Yixing), Deputy Director Yamashita Bu (Zengxing Foreign Firm), Kunshan Branch Director Tang Qinru (an old rice merchant in Kunshan), and Deputy Director Wakabayashi Kiichi (Sakota Foreign Firm). All those in charge are experienced in rice procurement and are sufficient to lead Chinese and Japanese procurement teams.</p>
<p>The faith of the staff is based on the Rice Control Association's oath: 1. We are here in wartime, shouldering the task of procuring grain, to contribute to the completion of the Greater East Asia War. 2. We should cherish and be grateful for the crystallization of farmers' hard work and strive for the best service. 3. We are aware that rice is the driving force of everything and should feel the importance and nobility of our responsibilities. 4. We abandon selfishness, work hard for the public, and fully expose the true face of Sino-Japanese cooperation.</p>
<p>A staff member of the Rice Control Association's lower-level organization expressed his state of mind to the reporters' team: "When engaged in the work of buying rice, I keep the four oaths of the General Association in mind day and night. Relying on this belief, I stand up to serve, equal to a soldier participating in the war. I have never forgotten the instructions of the Military Affairs Bureau on September 10, which said that this year's rice purchase is combat. Under this major premise, I also never forget the hard work of the farmers."</p>
<p>(3) On-site Purchase of Food Rice</p>
<p>This time, the Rice Control Association's purchase of food rice is carried out using the "allocation system" in areas with good public security (using the group, government, and baojia organization to register and store food rice for supply), and the purchase system is used in other areas. Regarding the amount of grain collected in various places, Kunshan adopts the allocation system. Those responsible for procurement include procurement merchants and cooperatives. In Changshu, those responsible for carrying out the procurement work include the Procurement Merchant Association, the Rice Industry Association, the cooperatives, and the newly established Field Industry Association.</p>
<p>According to the Jiangsu Office's announcement regarding the progress of the situation: "The Jiangsu region began purchasing in late October and is expected to reach the peak of purchasing in January next year. From the end of October to the beginning of November, the weather was cloudy and drizzly, hindering morning crops, causing lotus to collapse and root fibers to rot. It is recognized that in recent days, the weather has been clear and more than 170 rice merchants have been carrying out the purchase work in full swing."</p>
