<p>社評</p>
<h3>貢獻於日語敎師</h3>
<p>民廿六年以後，大家開始着重日語敎育。木東亞戰爭以後，大家更注意日語敎育。只要看現在書店裹所出資的所謂「百日通」「速成法一「自學法」等等，和報紙上所登載的日語學校的廣告，所調「個別敎授」「三月成功」等等，研究日語已經成為社會上的一種風氣。但是民廿六年到現在已經七年，大東亞戰爭亦已二年多了，日語敎育的成績怎樣？我們固然不敢說一點沒有，可是成績的不好也是事實。</p>
<p>最近日木大東亞省，為溝通中日文化起見，特別派遣來華日語講師二十四名，分配華中各大都市。講師都經過嚴格的考試和選擇，講科自然亦可歸於一律。這是有計劃的日語敎育的開始，對於中日文化的溝通上　實有重大意義，我們更願意提出三點憲見，貢獻於講師諸君。</p>
<p>這六七年來社會上無計劃的造就日語人材，有一個最壞的結果，就是使一般人對於日語人材的憎惡，最顯明的例就是所謂「通譯人員」。他們讀了不多時的日語，學會了極膚淺簡單的會話，對於日本國民，對於日本文化，根本沒有認識。可是速成之後，自命不凡，到各處區當通譯，滿面孔日本通。狐假虎威，魚肉人民，他們不但不能宜達日本的眞心誠意，更足以引起中國人民對於日本的反感。在這樣情况之下，多一個日語人材，中日邦交就多一層障碍。我們希望來華的講師諸君，對於中國學生，這是開宗明義第一課所應該說明的。</p>
<p>過去中國學校，從小學起到大學止，大都以英語為第一外國語，其他作為第二外國語。這是英美文化侵時政策的結果，可是因此國人對於學習英語的方法，研究得很有進步，尤其是對於初學者，很覺便利，更能够適合中國人的性情，提起中國人學習的興味。現在日語的重要已為一般人所明白，日語的成為第一外國語，也是當然的事。可是，怎樣編成一部適合中國人性情的敎科書？怎樣計劃一套鼓起中國人學習與味的敎授法？怎樣編著許多便利中國人的工具害？一切都有待於日語講師的埋頭苦幹。這是中日文化交流中的奠基石，是我們希望於講師諸君的第二點。</p>
<p>文化交流是相互的，講師諸君在造個非常時期到中國來傳播日本文化，就同時負一個回日本後傳播中國文化的使命。中國最尊重師道，中國社會裹師生的關係，最尊嚴，最親愛，所謂「一日之師，終身之父」，最足以表示中國精神。從老百姓的口裹，最聽得見一個民族的老實話，從學生們的談話裹，更可看出中國民族的眞心，更可看出中國文化將來的趨勢。介紹中國文化到日本去，固然不是講師諸君的任務，可是「近水樓台」，講師諸君為中。兩國的國運起見，應當十二分努力的。這是我們希望於講師諸君的第三點。</p>
<p>今天本報發表一篇「大東亞與日本語」的座談紀錄，是從日本評論上節譯的，討論日本語在大束亞的重要性。我們以此歡迎諸位講師，我們更希望諸位努力。</p>

<h3>郭培爾氏著文　論歐洲形勢　德準備應付任何事變</h3>
<p>柏林十日中央社電　徳宣傳部長郭培爾，在徳意志雜誌發表論文稱：共產主義在東西歐均已獲得地位，而西方之第一個犧牲者，將為英國。英人所希望於繼續作戰者果為何物乎？豈英人仍眞以為戰後仍能恢復歐陸之均勢乎？德人並不重視敵人以誇大之態度以宣佈具政治上及軍事上之計劃，敵人之所為者，僅為軟弱之表示。敵人倘能於可能之被會中，即能實現其企圖，則毋庸專事多言，茍不然者，則其多言乃英美保圖以宣傳欺人而已，茍英美以欺人為能事，則將盡喪其聲勢，其所以虛張聲勢第三種可能性，或因英美以政治上及心理上之理由，不得不作誇大宣傳亦未可知，但反軸心同盟之結稱，其中實存有不自然之　結。徳黑籣會鐵之結果，僅斯達林一人獲得滿意，因彼自知其本身之價值，故不肯以歐洲寸土讓子其盟國，一九三九年英人之所以參戰者，因係企圖阻止總國東部疆界之無關重要之修改，以為此種變更將失去歐洲之均勢，而有利於徳國，但自此以後，歐洲各國疆界之變更，使倫敦亦不得不承認歐陸永不能恢復一九三九年之情境之事實，此可見英國戰爭目的之錯誤。而英人之所欲阻止者，將以倍徒之物以形成之，今之形勢非利於德，即利於蘇，倫敦各報之評論，似亦能體騐此種事實，僅有英美方面之猶人以為，彼等仍處優勞，而事態有不可否認者，即局勢之發展，正如猶太人之所欲，共產主義已於東西歐獲得前進，英人將首當其衝，故英人突有為暫時防止不幸之來臨計，將利用柏林所宣布之政治休戰，但亦將遭遇同樣之命運。英人將信任何人以恢復歐洲之均勢乎，英人茍以為受到德人之威　，故欲整潰德國軍事力量，以消除其所受之危險，倘英人能達到成功，則蘇聯未始不能構成英國之更大威脅。今為討諭上之目的，假使英人之迷夢得以實現，而徳國陷於崩潰，則倫敦慶祝勝利之狂歡中，將因共黨之示威而中斷，英人造成一種合英美之力亦不能控制之局勢，而德人則以此為戰爭中最做要之間題，不久英人將　侵歐之大冒險，吾人相信英美必將受創而退，則其結果將如何？而英人之所能希望者，僅為共黨之征服徳國而己·是否共黨之勝利，即為英美之勝利？而現在之象徵已　示，吾人所述者乃根據事實之推論，並無絲毫之錯誤者。倫敦方面之民衆，亦有能預見此種悲劇者，但並不能於此尋一出路現已不復為英國之戰爭，英人曾欲使其盟國為英人火中取栗，而英人現己發覺其有必須為其盟國以冒此危險之工作之情勢矣·而在德國方面，則準備自動發生之危機之發展。當戰事達於高潮時，即有解决之辦法，而德指揮部得神環境之情勢，而作最有利之行動之絕對自白，而徳人則以堅忍之信心，决以任何代價以獲得勝利？德軍事上之成功，此為歷史上必須之結果，故無論何事發生，亦不足使吾人驚異，因吾人已决心應付任何事變也。</p>
<h3>緬甸日軍當局　發表談話共同防衛態勢益強化</h3>
<p>東京十日中央社電據緬甸日軍前綫某基地電，緬甸方面日本陸軍當局，於十日發表談話如次：敵方呼號奪回緬甸之手段，為先進兵印緬南部邊境，奪取日溪，於日軍因戰略關係自動撤退後，得以侵人孟多，於是向全世界大肆宜傳謂，反攻有成，其實該方面日陸軍部喙已先發制人，於空軍及印度國民軍緊密協力之下，一舉將自詡為最精銳之英第五師至少殲滅大半。日軍密林作戰隊，更由各方面猛攻殘存之英第五師，到處擊潰其主力，並擊退侵入加拉頓方面之敵，敵在該方面之反攻企圖完全受挫·富貢方面日陸軍各部隊之精銳，亦會重創渝軍，澈底粉碎其戰力，怒江方面之日軍，對該方面渝軍最近之蠢動，刻正强化怒江方面最前棧之防衛。中部邊境之緬甸國軍，亦曾於加富瓦西方，阿拉坎蓋金地區迭在優勢之空軍及砲隊之掩護下收獲光輝之戰果。日前會在更的宛河下流附近，充分發揮其新銳國軍之精神，負起其防衛國士之重責。日軍為實行共同防衛之任務，更曾學潰福特瓦特前面景里方面常來侵犯緬甸邊境，擾亂人民安寗之敵軍，緬甸邊境共同防衛之態勢，更趨强化。十日前後為澈底擊潰敵軍，更開始攻擊，確信不久敵軍之妄動即可為日軍　平。</p>

<p>日陸紀念節三品部長演詞</p>
<p>南京十日中央社電</p>
<p>昨（十日）為日本第三十九次陸軍紀念節，本京日僑並於晚七時，在東和劇塲舉行演講電影音樂大會。三品報道部長親臨演講，對日俄戰爭之敎訓，與大東亞戰爭之必勝信念，闡述極詳，茲錄講詞如下：</p>
<p>「植茲我人檢討當時世界列强，認為係三流國家之日本，花以世界至强至大之俄羅斯為對手，為團運之與亡，實行决戰。克服寡弱，制勝大敵，宣楊　威，以挽救此帝國自存·與東亞危急之戰役之時，吾人應處理正行作戰中大東亞戰爭之完遂，而决其若干嚴重之敎訓。日亞和平與獨立，對帝俄之東亞侵略，即西力之東漸，毅然蹶起，與之抗衡，民治三十七年二月一日，當我人拜受「對俄宜戰詔書」之際，即已大義昭然，吾人再就此與大東亞戰爭比較，其戰爭目的，純然一致。就中國而言，為英美大侵略東亞之對象，為資木主義榨取之市塲，然此對於東亞，尤其中晶兩民族，實為一生死存亡之問題。而中日事變以來，日本力謀解决此問題，竟尤於英美之野心與壓迫，而遭妄害與漠視，此實為吾人所小能容忍者。然而無論對日俄戰爭，對英美戰爭，悉先以外交折衝，而求達到和平解决。大東亞戰爭開戰前，交涉前途瀕於危殆之際，敵美方面哈斯特系之報紙，亦承認日木言論正當之事實，警告美國政府當局。因此羅期福所提出之對日宦戰决議案，曾遭反對。</p>
<p>於此，吾人試行觀察日俄戰爭當時，兩國國力戰力之數字比較，人口日本四千七百萬（約四倍）男子總數，日本二千四百萬。俄七千四百五十萬（約三倍）平時兵力，日本十七萬，俄百二十四萬（約八倍）砲日本六百九十門，俄四千二百門（約七倍。）（戰爭末期）戰場師團數，日本廿五個師團，俄四十五個師團。戰塲軍馬，日本十七萬二千頭，俄約四十萬頭。（損失）死傷數，日本廿萬，俄十四萬。俘虜數，日本二千，俄八萬（約十倍。）合計日本二十萬二千，俄二十二萬，此外若較敵我之編成于裝飾時，則俄軍較日軍為優之證例，誠不遑枚舉。要之，檢討晶俄戰爭當時敵方戰力，實具絕對之優勢，故現在英美之物質力，實不足畏。然對此優勢敵人，何以能得此大捷，其勝利原因如下：</p>
<p>日俄開戰前，日本政府派遺金子堅太郎子爵赴美，曾向美國民宜稱，一此次之開戰，係為帝國之存亡，除戰爭外，別無自衛之手段，」因此獲得彼等之諒解。孩子爵出發前，曾預聞我方陸海軍戰爭勝敗之推測，蓋子爵曾面謁寺內陸相，詢問推測如何。陸相答稱，毫無優劣，詳情當詢諸兒玉參謀次長。詢問兒玉次　時，同樣答稱，毫無優劣。其次海相答稱，預料毫無優劣，君在美國演說時，　聆悉日本軍　半數沉落之惡耗，也未可知，此乃日俄戰爭將開始時，中央統帥部之推測。（未完）</p>
<p>美國務副卿訪英任務</p>
<p>柏林十日中央社電</p>
<p>據此問政界表示：美國務副卿斯蒂了尼斯不日訪英之目的，在為美戰後帝國主義計劃開拓涂徑。據稱，斯氏將提出長篇累牘之美方願望，而使英方政策還遇大量之煩難。其將討論者大約不外此後以軍需品供給蘇聯石油分配非洲殖民葉政策，及地中海方面直接與英有關，一面美似以願對蘇聯讓步之利權等問題。至於反軸心在太平洋方面所遭各項困難，亦將佔斯氏談話之大部，　本年將舉行總統選舉，此次問題必須予以解决</p>
<h3>泰爾諾波爾展開激烈巷戰德軍自猶曼要城撤退</h3>
<p>瑞典京城十日中央社電　據莫斯科電：蘇聯情報局發表公報稱：傳巨哥夫元帥廳下第一烏克蘭戰綫軍，九日於勒伏夫（一名勒姆堡）奧迪薩鐵路綫要衝舊波領東南　泰爾諾波爾市（Tarnopol）郊外，與德軍正展開悽慘之巷戰。</p>
<p>柏林十日中央社電</p>
<p>德國新聞社，據德官方發表：克里伏洛格之西南敵仍猛施壓力，徳軍於反攻時曾將蘇軍由數處逐退，大隊敵軍多被殲滅或被驅散。基　伏格勒之西齊文尼哥洛加之西南，希佩托夫加之南，及揚彼爾（Jampol）之西南攻防戰，己增加其激烈性，蘇軍以優勢之部隊攻於多處而受挫，但於其他數處則已擭進展、德軍於激戰中退出猶員（Uman烏克蘭工業區）。中路僅有局部戰事，諾伏索科爾尼基及貝里斯哥湖之聞，敵以坦一克車及飛機大舉來攻，德軍於激戰中將其擊退。</p>
<p>德一九二六級</p>
<p>柏林十日中央社電</p>
<p>據海通社訊：德國一九一六年級靑年已奉召入伍，檢查　格結果，僅百分之一·五不含　　　　　徳國人民中　　　　　　年靑之一級</p>
<p>戰事迫近羅馬市民仍鎭靜</p>
<p>羅馬十日中央社電</p>
<p>據海通社訊：連週陰雨，納吐諾·安齊奧一帶，己成　國，初僅橋頭堡之東部為大水所淹　　則全部盡成池沼，砲彈落下，泥水四濺，士兵全身盡為泥污，在此情形下戰事已無法進行，僅斥堠隊及砲隊仍然活躍。羅馬每日均司問砲聲，夜間尤為淸晰，門窗亦為震動，羅馬市民仍極鎭靜，即反軸心軍有不久將發動大攻分，亦漠然置之。反之，對於保衛羅馬，均極信任，近以復活節轉瞬即屆，居民多紛紛準備度此佳節，似未覺戰爭之迫近羅馬。</p>

<p>出席者　長谷川如是　泉井久之助時枝誠記神保光大郎中島健藏</p>
<p>記者：今天座談會要討論的主題，是「大東亞舉日本語」，謂各位發揮　見……</p>
<p>諸君都知道，戰爭是愈演愈烈了。同時我們日本國的戚力，業巳在軍事上政治上，文化上，經濟上，伸入十萬萬大東亞的每個角蔣。成為皇戚普照的有力媒介者，總得算日本話吧！在南洋方面學習日語的風氣業已盛行起來·聽設政府當局以及各機關都非常努力於研究日語，關於日本語和大東亞共榮圈的關係，我想是有很多問題可以討論的。仔細想一下，造並非單純是語言問題，而在語言中尚含有重大的意義，想到這一點，關於現在的日木語晋及於大東亞各魔的這一形勞，是有很多間題可以商談的。看到日語能像今日如此的普及，實在是一件可喜可賀的事，然而要估計到前此大東亞各區內，是有着極某不同的五花入門語言系統的。因而談到調整，就必須按現實的政治和文化情形而加以解决。進而實行大東亞的語言政策。常然這絕不是單單把日語普及於大東亞全區就够了。而根據偉大的語言政策立塲來說，我想一定有很多的問題，今天就在這一方面，請大家多多發揮高見，以開鄙人茅塞。</p>
<p>日本語在大東亞各地的現狀</p>
<p>中島：我們曾在馬來等地，直接擔任過普及敎授日語的任務，一般地說來，當地居民的學習日語，可分為－灌輸才波勤的接受，與自動的要求學習兩種，而我們這批推行日文工作者，也必須顧到授受者雙方面的需求關係，方可達到順利推行的目的。所謂「大東亞建設與日文」這一問題，絕不單純是當地的問題，一方面最基本的日文研究和建立，即對日本本國也是必要的；另一方面從學問以外的觀點來看，欲使各地居民衷心顧學或必需學日文，則乾腕就需要戰學取得勝利，方可合理想地順利進行。</p>
<p>長谷川：對於大東亞的語言問題，其推行的現狀是怎樣的呢？而現在怎樣才能使對方接受呢？</p>
<p>中島：從當地敎授日文方面來說，其進行之方針，必須盡量求普遍化與能深入民間。現南洋方面已訓練有日文敎員幹部，派遺到各地去工作了！至於工作之成績，其一，就日方接收的學校，按步就班敎授靑年學生。其二，推動對方設立補習班及夜校自動學習日文·再說到普及的速度，遍翻過去歷史，或與戰時各國對殖民地之話言政策比較，速度　可說是驚人的了。</p>
<p>日文為大東亞共同語言</p>
<p>關於南洋各地區，己宣告獨立的各國，敎育文化方面，亦自有其自主性，雖不拒絕日文，然對方亦是有語言的，且因宗敎信仰的問題，語言更形複雜，欲求其統一化，勢必不能不有一種佔優勢的共同的語言，而日文即應運代與佔有了這席地位，成為大東亞的共同語了！不過，倘使同化政策行之過火，或反成為普及日語的阻礙，而又不能取放任政策，只好強迫學習日文了！這就是目前的問題中心，足以影響政治而應予以密切注視的。</p>
<p>長谷川：以日文為共同語怎樣呢？在大東亞所能接受的程度來說，日文比英文的荷蘭文又怎樣呢？</p>
<p>中島：在過渡時期來設，總還是用英文更方便些，但現在由於民族主義的覺醒，還有一個亞洲問題在內，我雖不敢斷定是普遍的人民，抑是國內的先知先覺者，而站　亞洲內的民族主義立塲上，仍然還是想接受日文的。成許，在語言構成方面說，也不無難於接受的地方，但我認為政治力如加强，則對戰爭有利，如統治之方針不錯誤，則日文是很可能成為共同語言的。</p>
<p>神保：而且，徵諸客觀之事實，日語並不難學，當地的居民頗易接受，且成績極其圓滿呢！在馬來方面，無論是校內或校外，對於學習日語及漢字都頗感興趣聖。</p>
<p>求普及上的困難性</p>
<p>長谷用：語言一物，在國外普及的程度是與國家的勢力一致的。所以所謂語言的困難，是用不着當作根本問題來看的，假使日木的國威宣楊於四方，則對方自會發展其木身接受日文的天才，而來克服一切學習的困難了。</p>
<p>再者，認文字為最雖的，往往就是該國的本身，如英國人認英文最難，中國人認中文最難，日本人也和他們一樣，認為日文最難，這是因為本國人在語用字每每精益求精，所以感覺難，但外國人學日語時不必求深造，只要到相當程　就知足了。</p>
<p>泉井：所以，普及這二間題，並不與語言本身的難易有何關聯，現在是建設大束亞的時期，必須考慮到日文的普及是和積極擴展國威有關，我們亦需加些助力，不容對於日文的接受與否任其自然的</p>
<p>泉井：所謂語言政策？也是和民族政策問題有密切關係的，而且，語言是表現民族精神中的一種，形成民族特質的方面很多，但我認為這都是由各民族間相互綜合起來的，所以，只要言語一通，而伴隨着言語的東西也就自然相通了，因此只要學好日本話，便會和日本人發生拔觸的，於是也會把話寫成文章，或是讀日本的刋物，還樣即會發且崇拜日本精神的心理，因此，縱或在實用意義上目前並不急需，但向遠處看，是必須使日文普及的。</p>
<p>神保：最初日文是自動展開的，進而成為現在的需言政策問題，竟達到必須普及日本話的地步，我認為單純為了實用，或當作非常手段，而立刻通行日文，這是不妥富的，應該說是由於來日方長，為了傳達日本的心，而不能不　播日文的。轉人第三版</p>

<p>以取締囤積為中心</p>
<p>今日的經濟問題，集中於物價問題，而物價對策，又以取締囤積為中心。日駐華谷大使此次視察華北時所發表的談話中·有一余確信整頓物價對策之中心，必須抑止投機國積而造成之畸形漲價一一語，可謂一針見血了。前日木報社評論「物價問題的核心」，以東京朝日新聞二月二十五日社評為張本，特別提出物價檢題的核心，在於革新政治；發揮政治力量，配合經濟措施，才能澈底挽救危機。</p>
<p>一為政不在多言，而在力行，一是古今中外淸明政治的圭臬，如今，物價對策是要為民衆解倒應的，其重要與急切性，恐怕是在目前任何一切經濟問題之上；解决物價問題的核心，既然在於取締囤積，那末，此次華中五省一市物價連絡會議的决定，就應當嚴格執行，羣不願忌，這個决定。就是今後對於不正當業者從事投機囤積，而觸犯經濟法規者，處以嚴刑。</p>
<p>近幾日來一般機資商人投機囤積，及一部份金融機關利用存戶資金暗中囤貨者，已覺大起恐慌，以是貶價出籠，日有所聞，而最近兩三日來的跌風，仍有每况愈下之勢，當局實宜乘此時期，大刀闊斧·斬草除根，勿失時機，勿願情面，務期囤積以圖暴利者，從此死灰不能復燃，那末，人民生活的前途，亦庶幾不至於萬劫不復了。</p>
<p>大東亞與日本語（自第二版轉來）</p>
<p>日本話的特性</p>
<p>長谷川：以日本話作共同語，這是既定方針，用不着我們再加伸說的。</p>
<p>神保：所謂共同語，是自然成長的結果，既然構作共同語，那末東亞各國語言中最好的就是日本語了！</p>
<p>時枝：而且無論在政治意義上，在經濟方面，或是文化方面，日本都是核心中的領導者，由於這　自然的趨勢，才被當作共同語的啊！</p>
<p>神保：我還想，籍國家的威力使日文成為共同語，這雖是一件好事，但在語言學方面研究，實在也可證明日文是最美善的語言呢！</p>
<p>泉井：那麼，美在什麽地方呢？</p>
<p>時枝：日語美的所在，我以為就是模稜兩可和模糊雙關的地方……（笑聲）</p>
<p>中島：日文的優秀性，在語言學上也得公認的，如詞彙的豐富，表現方式的五花入門奧妙無窮，這都是它的特性。</p>
<p>長谷川：我認為這一問題，與其稱作日文的特性，莫如稱作日人生活的特性之為妥，因為日木語是從生活中產生出來，而又用以表現生活態度的，所以日本的藝衛家流頗能懂得日語濃重的特性，這不是言傳的學同，而是意會的心得，故日木的語言藝術，並不能單純以語言形式來研究，而是匯在整個方面才能研究出來的</p>
<p>時枝：我所認為的特性，是日文歷史的特性，這與歐　語言的歷史特性是相差很遠的，一般說來，日本的原有語言，即大和語，是吸收着中國的語言成份，這一點的確使現在的日文非常複雜化了！我認為談到語言政策和國語問題的時候，這一種特性是很重要的·有極不相同的因素在集合着，混雜着，如想簡單的一下來解决它是不可能的。</p>
<p>泉井：以前稱入日本的是漢字，所以對於漢文是能任意使用盡情發揮的，然而近來，對於歐洲交字也採取為同樣消化吸取的態度，那末將來估量日本語時，就具有了兩種歷史特性，如忽略了此點，就不能研究日文的，如果說漢字太難，即不顧過去之歷史而欲取消漢字，恐怕也是不行的。</p>
<p>長谷川：假使一般人都認為使用困難，自然而然就會漸被淘汰的，任其自行海汰，而敎者只管敎下去，就讓自然淘汰與主觀的努力二老自然交錯好」了！縱或用不着提出漢字限制和不准用漢文的問題，但能够廢除者任其廢除好了！</p>
<p>漢文問題</p>
<p>時枝：所以談到日文美的時侯，就會同時感到日文和漢文二者的美。但站在語學家的立塲上，在意識方而技巧方而看來，二者似很調和，而實際上在普通的言語裹，是平行著完全不相同的東西。</p>
<p>泉井：從一般人的立塲上來說，將來倘把漢字去掉，日文反會不完全了，這一點暫且不談，那未日文中夾雜着漢字，將來又會發生什麼結果呢？我認為·關於漢文問題，將來是會自歸淘汰的，無論從文字方面說，也無論從語言法上講，日文會慢慢領單化的，一般地說來，所謂偉大語言，乃是機能大，而構成反趨向簡單的。再按理想說，構造比較商單，文字也自覺容易，表現力反血豐富，且能在　大的領域內通用，這才合理想，我認為明治以後的日文就具有這種傾向的。</p>
<p>長谷川：我們並不喜歡盡量製造漢字，可是事實上是仍然增添着的。</p>
<p>泉并：現因特殊技術方而的話，不斷湧現於社會裏在形式上看，好係非常勉强；不合道理的新造字，但實際上也許不是什麽新浩字，而是該社會裏原有的字。如果把漢字認作是日文中的骨幹之，其使用的方法必不相同，而整個的日文也會前單化了！</p>
<p>中島：但使用漢文的一成語過多持，道在語言學上講，就是用外國語，在　樣關係上分析語言而作各種的研究之外，就需要某種的整理，並不是任意想使它簡易的問題，也並不是造字的問題，而是需要在某種意義上適應現實的整理，現在縱或不寫漢字，但大和語有許多話早已和漢字的音謂相近了，而且巳認為是成熟的通用的話了！</p>
<p>長谷川：假使不用假借字，而把漢文用字母寫出來，不是也很可能麽？……我認為那是日文的一種特性，與其呌作難懂的漢文，倒莫如稱為外國文，而經常使用外國文，這是日人自古以來就有的天性。中世紀漢文輸入，也就是一個例證。在日常的話語中，喜用着難懂的字句與典故，日文中為什麽會發展了這種特性呢？我敢斷言，這是由於日人敎養的均等性所致。下曆人對於上曆人的話，並不以為是另外一個世界的話，而只要是日本話，則不論上下階曆的人　　自由使用的，這的確是一種特性，也是一種超越善惡的語言的態度呢。</p>
<p>調查研究的急務</p>
<p>中島：雖然站在指導的立塲上說好與壞都可以，但實際上日文究竟處於調種狀熊裏？這種見體的何查還非常欠缺，我希　能有政策，　術，或論鉀等方面的大作問世。同時我很盼望作一個最基本的埋頭研究。</p>
<p>泉并：關於道一點，我也會對日語詞　作過一個計劃，首先將其分為許多部門而加以整理，編排成功的話，不僅可便利於日人的理解與學習。且對大東亞各地的民族話，這種詞彙簡單明暸，也不失為可遵循的標準呢！同時關於詞彙單純大綱和體系亦曾有專書出版過，然而想完成一部更詐盡更具體的著作，却是需要許多人力和許多費用的艱困工作呢。時枝：政府目前從事研究的國語問題，如不充分進行某本調查，而想立即規定通行，也是不可能的，必須首先廣為搜集資料，再加以系統化的整鉀，才能便於選擇標準的。</p>
<p>神保：展以，我　希望政府對於統一語言，更要採取精細一點的政策才好，中島：為了將來普及發展日文起見，我認為根據文獻　社會史的材料，而研究過去的歷史是必要的。同時對於現時不斷變動着的語營也有研究的必要。再者，關於構成語言骨幹的基本文化也有　看它相互關聯的必要。現在正是整個語言學問的一大轉機，這是　無疑問的，今大我們所講的話，由別人看來或許是好奇的淸談。然而，實際上却是極端緊急的問題，又是有關於國運盛衰的間題。這就是以為目前語言間題，不僅是理想上的間題，同時也是現實上的治安問題，現」在也是戰爭的問題，所以必須瞭解到這種地步，而使其能够發展到這一地步。歸根結底來說地句，語言木身是整個文化的反映，於是就可以明白，日文好，就是日本好！益且不要單純說好，而就鬆懈起來，所以必須也當作一個實際的問題來加以努力不可！</p>
<p>神保：在道種嚴重的意義上，我盼望語言學家，能從象牙之塔，藝術之宮裹，大踏步走出來才好</p>
<p>記者：再談一下最近對敵性語言的排斥，這是單單因為是敵國的語言而徘斥的呢？還是欲使日文純化，使日文復歸於純正姿態，而具有歷史意義的呢？中為，因為目前在戰爭時期，從整體卜看還是排斥敵性國語為對，所謂排斥敵性話，最低限度從心鉀問題上說，從作戰間題上設，我認為是必要的，我想這個問題是早己明白的常識，這勿寗設是一個常識問題吧！</p>
<p>時枝：所常識問題，即對於說外國誤那種極端好奇的心鉀，或那種近乎崇拜的神情，加以撲滅就可以了！</p>
<p>長谷川：有日本現成的話，反而故意眞說外國話，這眞是一件怪串，但因此把今日業已日木化了的家也完全取消，也是事實上辦不到的事，這紙情形還會繼續下去的。但我想，最低限度不要再像明治年代所採取的積極態度就好了！（節譯二月號日木評論）</p>

<h3>海軍</h3>
<p>— 岩田豐雄著羊譯</p>
<p>九月的一天，擊將白帶子的眞人。滿身是汗的，完了功課，從道塲出來的時侯。</p>
<p>「谷學員……你這裹來了一封電報？」從分隊監事的S少佐，特意地將這電報親手交來，在眞人實在是一件不敢當的事情。</p>
<p>眞人在敎官的面前，將電報打開一看：</p>
<p>隆夫失踪若到貴處時請告知－－從隆夫的父親那裹來的電報·</p>
<p>失踪道兩個字，很激烈地擊着眞人的胸膛。恐怕顏色也要改變了罷－－</p>
<p>「是怎麼一回事情？一S少佐這樣的問着。分隊監事，好像陸軍的中隊長似的，對部下的私事也要詢問的。</p>
<p>眞人一點也沒掩飾，完全都向敎官說了。親友的隆夫，從少年時代就怎樣的憧憬着海軍，在這年夏天檢騐體格沒及格的時候，怎樣地陷於失望，並且－－</p>
<p>「是麽，－－可憐的孩子！」聽完了的少佐的話·雖然很短，但是充滿着感情的。</p>
<p>經過了三天，等到一個星期，也沒見着　夫到江田島來，</p>
<p>眞人並非不理解失踪的好友的心境。並且同情那只此一個男孩的牢口田的雙親心中的難過是要在想像以上的。所以倘然隆夫來訪的時候，一定要在村中找一家旅館給他住着，儘量的安慰他中告他，但是怎樣等着，也沒有信息。</p>
<p>他實在等不得了，終於給隆夫的父親打了一個電報。</p>
<p>——隆夫朱來一切詳示</p>
<p>回音來了一對書信。</p>
<p>據說這不過造他父親的想像，隆夫也許到眞人那裹去的。隆夫是滯在霧島溫泉的期間裏，失踪了的。在那以前曾向他父銳法信，說是付旅館的房錢，索去了很多的金錢。他雖是帶將這許多金錢失踪了的，但那並非失踪的主要原因，那證據就是他往霧島去以前，將自已的蓄金，全都領出來了，並且衣服如冬天的襯衣等都帶去了。這都是以後　明白了的。</p>
<p>－國民報效國家，並不只入海軍一途而已，</p>
<p>中學將畢業前·而離家逃亡，其不敏亦實堪憐。然老身只此一子，賤荊不勝悲歡，若未至責處，其將彷徨於何方，老身亦不勝聯念之至－</p>
<p>隆夭父親的書信，切切動人肺腑。和眞人的家庭不同，有很多的收入和財產，無論異甚麼學校，都是不成間題的，中學還沒畢業就出奔了，這實在是一種無理的行為，有時候也想着申斥他一下，同時又對　像那樣憧憬着的海軍，終於失敗而自甘暴棄的好友隆夫的心中，泛起一種同情之惑的——</p>
<p>（那個家伙，是一個周執不通的東西，…）</p>
<p>一個神經質的，好注意到瑣層的問題，然而一旦　氣起來，便一切都不顧慮的隆夫的性質，是和眞人相反的，却反因為這個二人之間是特別地親密的。從進入　小學以前，在天保山海滨同遊玩的老朋友，所以隆夫現在的心境，也可以明白地了解。想到他這種心情，可以推想那對「海軍」失敗了隆夫，是不會潛進兵學校的校門來會自己的。</p>
<p>「有一天來電報的那個孩子，以後怎麼樣了？」想不到有一天S少佐這樣的問，眞人帶着眼淚的回答着。</p>
<p>「中，大概不能來了吧」。</p>
<p>秋也深了。</p>
<p>學生們通稱的橘子山上，橘子和柚子，都變黃色了。江田烏是柑橘類和蕃薯的名產地，所以圓大的赤薯，也時常到兵學校的食桌上的。</p>
<p>「谷！在你的故鄉　薩摩薯，也呌　摩薯麽」？同級的明友這樣地向眞人問着。</p>
<p>「不，呌唐薯」。</p>
<p>「唐薯，可是個好名子，那麼若唐國去，呌甚麽哪」？</p>
<p>「不，那就　天　薯了。」</p>
<p>另外一個學友，這樣地學着眞人的口吻，都鬨堂大笑起來了。</p>
<p>眞人唯有嘻嘻地笑着，忍受他們的椰掄，但是心中感到無限的寂聊。學友們笑話自己的故鄉的方言與否，那都不成甚麽間題。薩摩薯－見到唐薯就想起冬日在天保山海濱，和隆夫燒唐薯吃的往事來了。將沙土掘成洞點上火，在那裹燒着蕃薯，外皮都焦了，而中心却是蒼白色。——</p>
<p>（究竟到甚麼地方去了，隆夫這個東西…）</p>
<p>眞人近來在自選時間或　燈後，時常這樣地想着。每當想起的時侯，都要起一種有不可言喻的。</p>

        <h1>1944 - n67</h1>
<h3>Contributing to Japanese Language Teachers</h3>
<p>After the 26th year of the Republic (1937), everyone began to focus on Japanese language education. After the Greater East Asia War, everyone paid even more attention to Japanese language education. Just look at the so-called "100-Day Mastery," "Rapid Success Method," "Self-Study Method," etc., published by bookstores now, and the advertisements for Japanese language schools in newspapers, such as "Individual Instruction," "Success in Three Months," etc. Studying Japanese has become a social trend. However, it has been seven years since the 26th year of the Republic, and more than two years since the Greater East Asia War. What are the results of Japanese language education? We certainly wouldn't dare say there are none, but the poor results are also a fact.</p>
<p>Recently, the Japanese Greater East Asia Ministry, in order to promote Sino-Japanese cultural exchange, specially dispatched twenty-four Japanese language instructors to China, distributed to major cities in Central China. The instructors have all undergone rigorous examinations and selection, and the teaching subjects can naturally be unified. This is the beginning of planned Japanese language education, which has great significance for the communication of Sino-Japanese culture. We would also like to offer three points as humble opinions, contributed to the instructors.</p>
<p>In the past six or seven years, the unplanned cultivation of Japanese language talents in society has had a worst outcome, which is to make the general public detest Japanese language talents. The most obvious example is the so-called "interpreters." They studied Japanese for a short time, learned very superficial and simple conversation, and had no understanding of the Japanese people or Japanese culture at all. However, after rapid success, they became self-important and acted as interpreters everywhere, with faces full of Japanese knowledge. They acted as a fox exploiting the tiger’s might, oppressing the people. Not only could they not convey Japan's sincerity, but they could also arouse the Chinese people's aversion to Japan. In this situation, the more Japanese language talents there are, the more obstacles there are to Sino-Japanese relations. We hope that the instructors coming to China should explain this to Chinese students in the very first lesson.</p>
<p>In the past, Chinese schools, from elementary school to university, mostly used English as the first foreign language, with others as the second foreign language. This was the result of the cultural invasion policy of Britain and the United States, but as a result, Chinese people have made great progress in researching methods of learning English. It is especially convenient for beginners and can better suit the Chinese people's temperament, arousing their interest in learning. Now, the importance of Japanese has been understood by the general public, and it is natural for Japanese to become the first foreign language. However, how to compile a textbook that suits the temperament of the Chinese people? How to plan a set of teaching methods that arouse the Chinese people's interest in learning? How to compile many tools that are convenient for Chinese people? Everything depends on the hard work of the Japanese language instructors. This is the cornerstone of Sino-Japanese cultural exchange, which is our second point of hope for the instructors.</p>
<p>Cultural exchange is mutual. The instructors have come to China during this extraordinary period to spread Japanese culture, and they also have the mission of spreading Chinese culture after returning to Japan. China respects teachers the most. The relationship between teachers and students in Chinese society is the most solemn and affectionate. The saying "A teacher for one day, a father for life" best expresses the Chinese spirit. From the mouths of ordinary people, one can hear the most honest words of a nation. From the conversations of students, one can see the true heart of the Chinese people and the future trends of Chinese culture. Introducing Chinese culture to Japan is certainly not the task of the instructors, but being in a favorable position, the instructors should make twelve points of effort for the sake of the national fortunes of China and Japan. This is our third point of hope for the instructors.</p>
<p>Today, this newspaper publishes a record of a symposium on "The Greater East Asia and the Japanese Language," which is an abridged translation from a Japanese commentary, discussing the importance of the Japanese language in Greater East Asia. We welcome all the instructors with this, and we hope that you will all work hard.</p>

<h3>Mr. Guo Pei'er Writes an Article on the European Situation; Germany Prepares to Deal with Any Eventuality</h3>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency) German Propaganda Minister Guo Pei'er published an article in the German magazine, stating: Communism has gained a foothold in both Eastern and Western Europe, and the first victim in the West will be Britain. What do the British hope to achieve by continuing the war? Do the British still really believe that they can restore the balance of power in Europe after the war? The Germans do not attach importance to the exaggerated announcements of political and military plans by the enemy. What the enemy is doing is only a sign of weakness. If the enemy could realize its intentions in the possible meetings, it would not need to speak more. If not, then its more speech is only a propaganda deception by Britain and the United States. If Britain and the United States are capable of deceiving people, they will lose their prestige. A third possibility of exaggerating their strength may be because Britain and the United States have to make exaggerated propaganda for political and psychological reasons, but the alliance of the anti-Axis alliance has unnatural conclusions. As a result of the Tehran Conference, only Stalin was satisfied, because he knew his own value and refused to let his allies give up an inch of European land. In 1939, the British participated in the war because they attempted to prevent the unimportant modification of the eastern borders of the General State, believing that this change would lose the balance of power in Europe and benefit Germany. But since then, the changes in the borders of European countries have made London have to admit the fact that the European continent can never restore the situation of 1939. This shows the error of Britain's war aims. And what the British want to prevent will be formed with double the material. The current situation is either favorable to Germany or to the Soviet Union. The comments of London newspapers seem to be able to understand this fact. Only the Jews in Britain and the United States think that they are still in a superior position, and the development of the situation is undeniable, that is, the development of the situation is just as the Jews want, and communism has gained progress in Eastern and Western Europe. The British will be the first to bear the brunt, so the British suddenly have to take advantage of the political truce announced by Berlin to temporarily prevent the misfortune from coming, but they will also encounter the same fate. Who will the British believe to restore the balance of power in Europe? If the British think that they are threatened by the Germans, they want to defeat the German military forces to eliminate the danger they have suffered. If the British can achieve success, then the Soviet Union may not be able to constitute a greater threat to Britain. Now, for the purpose of discussion, if the British dream can be realized and Germany collapses, then London's celebration of victory will be interrupted by the communist demonstration. The British have created a situation that even the combined forces of Britain and the United States cannot control, and the Germans regard this as the most important issue in the war. Soon the British will invade Europe in a great adventure. We believe that Britain and the United States will be injured and retreat. Then what will be the result? And what the British can hope for is only the communist conquest of Germany. Is the communist victory the victory of Britain and the United States? And the current symbols have shown that what we have described is a deduction based on facts, without the slightest error. There are also people in London who can foresee this tragedy, but they cannot find a way out. It is no longer a British war. The British once wanted to make their allies take chestnuts from the fire for the British, but the British have now discovered that they have the task of taking this risk for their allies. And in Germany, preparations are being made for the development of the crisis that will occur automatically. When the war reaches its climax, there will be a solution. The German command can know the situation of the environment and make the most favorable action with absolute self-confidence. The Germans are determined to achieve victory at any cost with enduring confidence. The military success of the Germans is the inevitable result in history, so no matter what happens, it is not enough to surprise us, because we have decided to deal with any eventuality.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Authorities in Myanmar Issue a Statement: The Common Defense Posture is Increasingly Strengthened</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese military front-line base in Myanmar, the Japanese army authorities in Myanmar issued a statement on the 10th as follows: The enemy's means of calling for the recapture of Myanmar are to advance troops to the southern border of India and Myanmar, capture Rijie, and after the Japanese army voluntarily withdrew due to strategic relations, they were able to invade Mengduo. Thus, the world was greatly publicized that the counterattack was successful. In fact, the Japanese army in that area had preemptively, with the close cooperation of the air force and the Indian National Army, annihilated at least most of the British Fifth Division, which was touted as the most elite. The Japanese army's jungle combat team, with more fierce attacks from all sides on the surviving British Fifth Division, repeatedly defeated its main force, and repelled the enemy who invaded the Kaladan area. The enemy's counterattack attempt in that area was completely frustrated. The elite of the Japanese army units in the Fugong area also heavily damaged the Chongqing army and thoroughly shattered its combat power. The Japanese army on the Nujiang River is currently strengthening the defense of the forefront of the Nujiang River against the recent movements of the Chongqing army in that area. The Myanmar National Army in the central border area has also repeatedly achieved brilliant results in the Jiahua West and Alakangaijin areas under the cover of a superior air force and artillery team. A few days ago, in the vicinity of the lower reaches of the Gengdiwan River, they fully demonstrated the spirit of their new national army and took on the important responsibility of defending their country. In order to carry out the task of common defense, the Japanese army also learned to defeat the enemy forces that often invaded the Myanmar border in the area in front of Fort Wat and disrupted the people's peace. The situation of common defense on the Myanmar border is becoming more and more strengthened. Around the 10th, in order to thoroughly defeat the enemy forces, the attack was started, and it is believed that the enemy's reckless actions will soon be put down by the Japanese army.</p>

<p>Minister Sampu's Speech on Japanese Army Memorial Day</p>
<p>Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 10th) was the 39th Japanese Army Memorial Day. The Japanese residents in Nanjing held a large gathering in the evening at the Donghe Theater with speeches, movies, and music. Minister Sampu of the Information Department personally delivered a speech, explaining in detail the lessons of the Russo-Japanese War and the belief in the inevitable victory of the Greater East Asia War. The text of the speech is as follows:</p>
<p>"As we examine the world powers of that time, Japan, considered a third-rate country, faced Russia, the strongest and largest in the world, in a decisive battle for the fate of the nation. Overcoming weakness and defeating a formidable enemy, it promoted its prestige and saved the Empire and East Asia from crisis. At this time, we should handle the completion of the Greater East Asia War, which is currently in progress, and resolve its several serious lessons. The purpose of the Russo-Japanese War was to secure peace and independence for Asia and to resist the eastward aggression of Imperial Russia, the eastward expansion of Western powers. On February 1, the 37th year of the Meiji era, when we received the 'Imperial Rescript Declaring War on Russia,' the great cause was already clear. If we compare this with the Greater East Asia War, the war aims are purely consistent. In the case of China, it was the target of Anglo-American aggression in East Asia and a market for capitalist exploitation. This was a matter of life and death for East Asia, especially for the two nations of China and Japan. Since the China Incident, Japan has been striving to resolve this problem, but it has been met with the ambition and oppression of Britain and America, and has been disregarded. This is something we cannot tolerate. However, in both the Russo-Japanese War and the war against Britain and America, we first sought peaceful solutions through diplomatic negotiations. Before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, when negotiations were on the verge of collapse, even the Hearst newspapers in the enemy American camp acknowledged the legitimacy of Japanese arguments and warned the U.S. government authorities. As a result, Roosevelt's resolution for war against Japan met with opposition.</p>
<p>Here, let us compare the national strength and military strength of the two countries at the time of the Russo-Japanese War. The population of Japan was 47 million (about four times less), and the total number of men was 24 million. Russia's population was 74.5 million (about three times more). Japan's peacetime military strength was 170,000, while Russia's was 1.24 million (about eight times more). Japan had 690 cannons, while Russia had 4,200 (about seven times more). (At the end of the war) The number of divisions on the battlefield was 25 for Japan and 45 for Russia. The number of military horses on the battlefield was 172,000 for Japan and about 400,000 for Russia. (Losses) The number of deaths and injuries was 200,000 for Japan and 140,000 for Russia. The number of prisoners of war was 2,000 for Japan and 80,000 for Russia (about ten times more). In total, Japan had 202,000 casualties, and Russia had 220,000. Furthermore, if we compare the organization and equipment of the enemy and ourselves, the examples of the Russian army being superior to the Japanese army are too numerous to mention. In short, an examination of the enemy's military strength at the time of the Russo-Japanese War reveals an absolute advantage. Therefore, the material power of Britain and America today is not to be feared. However, how did we achieve such a great victory against this superior enemy? The reasons for the victory are as follows:</p>
<p>Before the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War, the Japanese government sent Viscount Kaneko Kentaro to the United States, where he told the American people that 'this war is for the survival of the Empire, and there is no means of self-defense other than war.' As a result, they gained their understanding. Before departing, Viscount Kaneko had inquired about our army and navy's predictions of success or failure in the war. He had personally asked Army Minister Terauchi about his predictions. The Army Minister replied that there was no clear advantage or disadvantage and that details should be sought from Vice Chief of Staff Kodama. When asked, Vice Chief of Staff Kodama gave the same answer, saying that there was no clear advantage or disadvantage. Next, the Navy Minister replied that he anticipated no clear advantage or disadvantage and that Viscount Kaneko might hear the bad news that half of the Japanese fleet had sunk during his speeches in America. This was the prediction of the central command at the beginning of the Russo-Japanese War." (To be continued)</p>
<p>U.S. Under Secretary of State's Mission to Britain</p>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>According to informed political circles: The purpose of U.S. Under Secretary of State Stettinius's visit to Britain in the near future is to pave the way for the post-war imperialist plans of the United States. It is said that Stettinius will present a lengthy list of U.S. desires, creating many difficulties for British policy. The topics to be discussed will likely include the supply of military supplies to the Soviet Union, the distribution of oil, colonial policies in Africa, and issues directly related to Britain in the Mediterranean. The U.S. seems willing to make concessions to the Soviet Union on certain rights. The various difficulties encountered by the anti-Axis powers in the Pacific will also occupy a large part of Stettinius's talks. The presidential election will be held this year, and these issues must be resolved.</p>
<h3>Fierce Street Fighting Breaks Out in Tarnopol; German Forces Retreat from Key City of Uman</h3>

<p>Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>According to the German News Agency, citing official German sources: The enemy to the southwest of Krivoy Rog is still applying fierce pressure. During counterattacks, German forces drove the Soviet troops back from several locations, and large numbers of enemy troops were annihilated or dispersed. The defensive battles to the west of Kirovograd, southwest of Zvenigorodka, south of Shepetovka, and southwest of Jampol have intensified. Soviet forces attacked in multiple locations with superior forces but were repulsed. However, in other locations, they have made progress. German forces withdrew from Uman (Ukrainian industrial area) during fierce fighting. Only localized battles occurred in the central sector. Between Novosokolniki and the Beloye Lake, the enemy launched a large-scale attack with tanks and aircraft, but German forces repelled them in fierce fighting.</p>

<p>Situation Tense Near Rome, but Citizens Remain Calm</p>
<p>Rome, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>According to the Huitong News Agency: Continuous weeks of rain have turned the area around Nettuno and Anzio into a quagmire. Initially, only the eastern part of the bridgehead was flooded, but now the entire area has become a swamp. Shells falling cause mud and water to splatter, and soldiers are covered in mud. Under these conditions, combat is impossible, and only reconnaissance patrols and artillery units remain active. The sound of artillery can be heard in Rome every day, especially clearly at night, and windows shake. However, the citizens of Rome remain extremely calm and indifferent to the impending major offensive by the anti-Axis forces. On the contrary, they have great faith in the defense of Rome. As Easter approaches, residents are busily preparing to celebrate the holiday, seemingly unaware of the proximity of the war to Rome.</p>
<h3>German Aircraft Recently Used Gas-Based Self-Igniting Bombs in Raids on London; U.S. Air Force Again Attacks Berlin in Daylight</h3>
<p>Zurich, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Swiss newspapers on the 7th commented on the new tactics used by German aircraft in bombing London: In recent air raids on London, the German air force used stratospheric bombers, which ascended to an altitude of 6,000 meters above London and then dropped bombs. The bombs were made of flammable gas and ignited automatically after being dropped, making them more effective than the stick-shaped incendiary bombs used by the U.S. Air Force.</p>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to military sources: On the afternoon of the 9th, residential areas of Berlin were again bombed by U.S. aircraft. The U.S. Air Force used dense cloud cover to carry out terror attacks, causing casualties among civilians in the city. Despite the unfavorable weather, anti-aircraft guns put up strong resistance, destroying several four-engine bombers and fighter aircraft. The heavy cloud cover prevented enemy aircraft from identifying targets, and they dropped bombs blindly and aimlessly. During the previous daylight raid, the U.S. suffered losses of over 250 aircraft and over 2,000 aircrew. They now seem to have changed their tactics and are coming in cloudy weather.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a London dispatch, the U.S. Air Force Command announced that seven bombers and one fighter aircraft were lost during the bombing of Berlin on the 9th.</p>

<p>Reporter: The topic of today's discussion is "Greater East Asia and the Japanese Language". I hope everyone will share their views...</p>
<p>As you all know, the war is intensifying. At the same time, the strength of our Japanese nation has extended militarily, politically, culturally, and economically into every corner of the vast Greater East Asia. The most effective medium for the Emperor's benevolence to shine upon these areas is undoubtedly the Japanese language! The trend of learning Japanese has become prevalent in the South Seas. I have heard that government authorities and various organizations are working very hard to study Japanese. I believe there are many issues to discuss regarding the relationship between the Japanese language and the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. If you think about it carefully, it is not just a simple language problem, but the language also contains significant meaning. With this in mind, there are many issues to discuss regarding the current spread of the Japanese language throughout Greater East Asia. It is indeed a joyful and commendable thing to see the Japanese language becoming so popular today. However, we must consider that there are extremely diverse and complex language systems within Greater East Asia. Therefore, when it comes to coordination, we must resolve it based on the actual political and cultural situation, and then implement a language policy for Greater East Asia. Of course, this is not simply about popularizing the Japanese language throughout Greater East Asia. Based on a grand language policy, I believe there are many issues. Today, in this regard, I would like to ask everyone to share their insightful views to enlighten me.</p>
<p>The Current Situation of the Japanese Language in Various Regions of Greater East Asia</p>
<p>Nakajima: We have directly undertaken the task of promoting and teaching Japanese in places like Malaya. Generally speaking, the local residents' learning of Japanese can be divided into two types: passive acceptance and active demand for learning. Our group of Japanese language promoters must also consider the needs of both the givers and the receivers in order to achieve successful promotion. The issue of "Greater East Asia Construction and the Japanese Language" is not simply a local issue. On the one hand, basic Japanese language research and establishment are also necessary for Japan itself. On the other hand, from a non-academic perspective, if we want to make local residents sincerely like or need to learn Japanese, we need to win the war in order to proceed smoothly in an ideal manner.</p>
<p>Hasegawa: What is the current status of the promotion of the language issue in Greater East Asia? And how can we get the other party to accept it now?</p>
<p>Nakajima: From the perspective of teaching Japanese locally, the direction of progress must be to seek as much universality as possible and to penetrate deeply into the people. Japanese language teacher cadres have been trained in the South Seas and dispatched to work in various places! As for the results of the work, firstly, the schools received by the Japanese side teach young students step by step. Secondly, we promote the establishment of cram schools and night schools for the other party to learn Japanese on their own initiative. Speaking of the speed of popularization, compared with the language policies of various countries towards their colonies in the past, the speed can be said to be astonishing.</p>
<p>Japanese as a Common Language in Greater East Asia</p>
<p>Regarding the countries in various regions of the South Seas that have declared independence, their education and culture also have their autonomy. Although they do not reject Japanese, the other party also has a language, and the language is even more complicated due to religious beliefs. If we want to unify them, we must have a dominant common language, and the Japanese language should emerge and occupy this position, becoming the common language of Greater East Asia! However, if the assimilation policy goes too far, it may become an obstacle to the popularization of Japanese. However, we cannot adopt a laissez-faire policy and have to force people to learn Japanese! This is the current focus of the problem, which is enough to affect politics and should be closely watched.</p>
<p>Hasegawa: How about using Japanese as a common language? In terms of the extent to which it can be accepted in Greater East Asia, how does Japanese compare to English and Dutch?</p>
<p>Nakajima: In the transitional period, it is still more convenient to use English, but now, due to the awakening of nationalism, and also because of the Asian problem, although I dare not say it is the general public or the insightful people in the country, they still want to accept Japanese from the perspective of nationalism within Asia. Perhaps, in terms of language structure, there are also places that are difficult to accept, but I think that if political power is strengthened, it will be beneficial to the war. If the policy of governance is not mistaken, then Japanese is very likely to become a common language.</p>
<p>Jinbo: Moreover, based on objective facts, Japanese is not difficult to learn. The local residents accept it quite easily, and the results are very satisfactory! In Malaya, whether inside or outside the school, they are quite interested in learning Japanese and Chinese characters.</p>
<p>Difficulties in Seeking Popularization</p>
<p>Hasegawa: The extent to which a language is popularized abroad is consistent with the strength of the country. Therefore, the so-called difficulty of the language is not something that needs to be seen as a fundamental problem. If Japan's national prestige is promoted in all directions, then the other party will naturally develop their own genius for accepting Japanese and overcome all learning difficulties.</p>
<p>Furthermore, those who consider the writing system to be the most difficult are often the countries themselves. For example, the British think English is the most difficult, the Chinese think Chinese is the most difficult, and the Japanese are the same, thinking Japanese is the most difficult. This is because the people of the country are always striving for perfection in the use of words, so they feel it is difficult. However, foreigners do not need to pursue in-depth study when learning Japanese. They only need to be satisfied with reaching a certain level.</p>
<p>Izui: Therefore, the issue of popularization has nothing to do with the difficulty of the language itself. Now is the time to build Greater East Asia. We must consider that the popularization of Japanese is related to the active expansion of national prestige. We also need to add some help and not allow the acceptance or rejection of Japanese to be left to nature.</p>
<p>Izui: The so-called language policy is also closely related to the issue of ethnic policy. Moreover, language is a manifestation of the spirit of the nation. There are many aspects that form the characteristics of a nation, but I think these are all mutually integrated among the various ethnic groups. Therefore, as long as the language is understood, the things that accompany the language will naturally be understood. Therefore, as long as you learn Japanese well, you will come into contact with Japanese people. You will also write words into articles or read Japanese publications. In this way, you will also develop a psychology of admiring the Japanese spirit. Therefore, even if it is not urgently needed in a practical sense at present, we must popularize Japanese in the long run.</p>
<p>Jinbo: Initially, Japanese was developed automatically, and then it became a matter of current language policy, and it has reached the point where Japanese must be popularized. I think it is inappropriate to immediately pass Japanese for the simple purpose of practical use or as an extraordinary means. It should be said that it is because the future is long, and in order to convey the heart of Japan, we cannot help but spread Japanese. Continued on page three.</p>

<p>Focusing on Curbing Hoarding</p>
<p>Today's economic problems are concentrated on the issue of prices, and the price policy is focused on curbing hoarding. In his remarks during his recent inspection of North China, the Japanese Ambassador to China Gu stated that he firmly believes that the core of the price stabilization policy must be to suppress the abnormal price increases caused by speculative hoarding, which can be described as hitting the nail on the head. The commentary in yesterday's newspaper, "The Core of the Price Problem," based on the editorial of the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun on February 25th, specifically pointed out that the core of the price issue lies in reforming politics; only by exerting political power and coordinating economic measures can the crisis be thoroughly resolved.</p>
<p>One is that good governance lies not in many words but in vigorous action, which is the guiding principle of clear governance throughout history and in China and abroad. Today, price control is to relieve the people's suffering, and its importance and urgency are probably above any other economic issue at present. Since the core of solving the price problem lies in curbing hoarding, the decision of the recent price coordination conference of five provinces and one city in Central China should be strictly enforced, without fearing resentment. This decision is that in the future, those who engage in speculative hoarding and violate economic regulations will be severely punished.</p>
<p>In recent days, the general investment merchants engaged in speculative hoarding, and some financial institutions that secretly hoard goods using depositors' funds, have felt great panic, and there are daily reports of price reductions. The downward trend in the past two or three days still shows a tendency to worsen. The authorities should take advantage of this period to take decisive action, cut the weeds and eliminate the roots, not miss the opportunity, and not yield to sentiment, so that those who hoard for exorbitant profits will never be able to recover, so that the future of the people's lives will not be in irreversible crisis.</p>
<p>Greater East Asia and Japanese (Continued from Page 2)</p>
<p>Characteristics of the Japanese Language</p>
<p>Hasegawa: Using Japanese as a common language is a set policy, and there is no need for us to elaborate.</p>
<p>Jimbo: The so-called common language is the result of natural growth. Since we are constructing a common language, then the best language among the languages of East Asian countries is Japanese!</p>
<p>Tokieda: Moreover, whether in political significance, economic aspects, or cultural aspects, Japan is the leader in the core. It is because of this natural trend that it is regarded as the common language!</p>
<p>Jimbo: I also think that it is a good thing to use the power of the state to make Japanese the common language, but in terms of linguistic research, it can also prove that Japanese is the most beautiful and good language!</p>
<p>Izumi: Then, where is the beauty?</p>
<p>Tokieda: The beauty of the Japanese language, I think, lies in its ambiguity and double entendre... (laughter)</p>
<p>Nakajima: The excellence of Japanese is also recognized in linguistics, such as the richness of vocabulary and the infinite mystery of expression. These are its characteristics.</p>
<p>Hasegawa: I think this problem is better called the characteristics of Japanese life than the characteristics of Japanese, because Japanese is produced from life and used to express attitudes to life. Therefore, Japanese artists can understand the strong characteristics of Japanese, which is not the same as learning through oral transmission, but the result of tacit understanding. Therefore, the language art of Japanese cannot be studied simply in terms of language form, but can only be studied by combining the whole aspect.</p>
<p>Tokieda: The characteristic that I think of is the historical characteristic of Japanese, which is very different from the historical characteristics of European languages. Generally speaking, the original Japanese language, that is, the Yamato language, absorbs the Chinese language components, which does make the current Japanese language very complicated! I think this kind of characteristic is very important when talking about language policy and the national language problem. There are very different factors gathering and mixing together. It is impossible to solve it simply.</p>
<p>Izumi: What was imported into Japan in the past was Chinese characters, so it can be used freely and fully exerted for Chinese. However, recently, the same attitude of digestion and absorption has been adopted for European writing. Then, when evaluating Japanese in the future, it will have two historical characteristics. If this point is ignored, Japanese cannot be studied. If it is said that Chinese characters are too difficult, and one wants to abolish Chinese characters without considering the past history, I am afraid it will not work.</p>
<p>Hasegawa: If people generally think it is difficult to use, it will naturally be gradually eliminated. Let it be eliminated by itself, and the teachers will just teach, so that natural elimination and subjective efforts will naturally intersect! Even if there is no need to propose restrictions on Chinese characters or not allowing the use of Chinese, those who can be abolished should be allowed to be abolished!</p>
<p>The Problem of Chinese Characters</p>
<p>Tokieda: Therefore, when talking about the beauty of Japanese, one will also feel the beauty of both Japanese and Chinese. However, from the standpoint of a linguist, from the perspective of consciousness and technique, the two seem to be very harmonious, but in fact, in ordinary language, they are parallel and completely different things.</p>
<p>Izumi: From the standpoint of ordinary people, if Chinese characters are removed in the future, Japanese will be incomplete. Let's not talk about this for the time being. Then, what will happen in the future if Chinese characters are mixed in Japanese? I think that the problem of Chinese characters will be eliminated by itself in the future. Whether from the aspect of writing or from the aspect of grammar, Japanese will slowly simplify. Generally speaking, the so-called great language is one that has a large function and a tendency to simplify the structure. Furthermore, according to the ideal, the structure is relatively simple, the writing is also easier, the expressive force is richer, and it can be used in a larger field. This is ideal. I think the Japanese after the Meiji period has this tendency.</p>
<p>Hasegawa: We don't like to create Chinese characters as much as possible, but in fact, they are still being added.</p>
<p>Izumi: Now, because special technical terms are constantly emerging in society, in terms of form, it seems very far-fetched and unreasonable to create new characters, but in fact, it may not be new words at all, but the original words in that society. If Chinese characters are regarded as the backbone of Japanese, the way to use them must be different, and the entire Japanese will also be simplified!</p>
<p>Nakajima: However, if too many Chinese idioms are used, in terms of linguistics, it is using a foreign language. In addition to analyzing language and conducting various researches in the same relationship, some kind of sorting is needed. It is not a question of arbitrarily wanting to make it simple, nor is it a question of creating words, but a need for a sorting that adapts to reality in some sense. Even if Chinese characters are not written now, many words in Yamato language have long been similar to the sound of Chinese characters and have already been considered mature and commonly used words!</p>
<p>Hasegawa: If we don't use borrowed words and write Chinese in letters, wouldn't that be possible too?...I think that is a characteristic of Japanese. Instead of calling it difficult Chinese, it is better to call it a foreign language, and constantly using foreign languages is a natural habit of Japanese people since ancient times. The import of Chinese during the Middle Ages is also an example. In daily speech, we like to use difficult words and allusions. Why has this characteristic developed in Japanese? I dare to say that this is due to the equality of education of the Japanese. The people in the lower classes do not think that the words of the people in the upper classes are words of another world, but as long as it is Japanese, people of all classes can use them freely. This is indeed a characteristic, and it is also a linguistic attitude that transcends good and evil.</p>
<p>The Urgent Task of Investigation and Research</p>
<p>Nakajima: Although it is good or bad to say it from a guiding standpoint, what kind of condition is Japanese actually in? There is still a great lack of specific research on this. I hope that there will be great works on policy, technique, or logic. At the same time, I am very much looking forward to doing a most basic in-depth research.</p>
<p>Izumi: Regarding this point, I also had a plan to sort out the Japanese vocabulary and divide it into many departments. If it is arranged successfully, it will not only be convenient for Japanese people to understand and learn, but also for the ethnic languages ​​of Greater East Asia, this simple and clear vocabulary can also be a standard to follow! At the same time, there have also been special books published on the outline and system of vocabulary simplification. However, to complete a more detailed and concrete work requires a lot of manpower and a lot of costly work.</p>
<p>Tokieda: The national language problem that the government is currently engaged in research on will not be possible to stipulate immediately without fully carrying out a certain investigation. First of all, it is necessary to widely collect data and then systematically sort out it to facilitate the selection of standards.</p>
<p>Jimbo: Therefore, I hope that the government will adopt a more detailed policy for unifying the language. Nakajima: In order to popularize and develop Japanese in the future, I think it is necessary to study the past history based on literary and social historical materials. At the same time, it is also necessary to study the constantly changing vocabulary at the present time. Furthermore, it is necessary to see how the basic culture that constitutes the backbone of language is related to each other. Now is a major turning point in the entire linguistic knowledge, and there is no doubt about it. The words we are talking about today may seem to be curious Qing talks to others. However, in fact, it is an extremely urgent issue, and it is also an issue related to the prosperity and decline of the country. This is because the current language problem is not only an ideal problem, but also a realistic security problem, and it is also a war problem now, so it must be understood to this extent and be able to develop to this extent. In the final analysis, language itself is a reflection of the entire culture, so it can be understood that good Japanese is good Japan! And do not simply say good and relax, so it must also be treated as a practical problem and worked hard!</p>
<p>Jimbo: In this serious sense, I hope that linguists can step out of the ivory tower and the palace of art.</p>
<p>Reporter: Let's talk about the recent rejection of enemy languages. Is this simply because they are the languages ​​of enemy countries? Or is it to purify Japanese, to restore Japanese to its pure state, and to have historical significance? Nakajima: Because we are currently in wartime, from an overall point of view, it is still right to reject enemy national languages. The so-called rejection of enemy languages, at a minimum, from the mental problem, from the operational problem, I think it is necessary. I think this problem is a well-understood common sense, this can be regarded as a common sense problem!</p>
<p>Tokieda: The common sense problem is to eliminate that extremely curious state of mind or that almost worshipful expression for speaking foreign languages!</p>
<p>Hasegawa: It's really strange to deliberately speak foreign languages ​​when there are ready-made Japanese words, but it is also impossible to completely cancel the families that have been Japanese-ized today. This situation will continue to exist. But I think, at a minimum, don't adopt the active attitude that was adopted in the Meiji era! (Excerpted from the February issue of Japanese Review)</p>

<h3>Registration Required for Major Commodities; Non-Compliance Will Be Prosecuted</h3>
<p>In order to stabilize the market conditions of various industries and alleviate the suffering of the people, the authorities are paying close attention to the buying, selling, and pricing of major commodities. To prevent illegal hoarding and to ensure an adequate supply on the market, all parties storing, buying, and manufacturing major commodities (including raw materials and finished products) must register in accordance with regulations. (A) Individual applicants can apply to the local competent authority. (B) Applicants who are members of trade associations should have their applications compiled and forwarded by their respective trade associations to the local competent authority. The items to be filled in are as follows:</p>
<p>Type and name of the commodity; Quantity of the commodity; Source of the commodity and the time and value of its acquisition; Packaging method; Location of storage; Brand name, business location, and the name and address of the responsible person of the commodity owner; Brand name, business location, and the name and address of the responsible person of the applicant; Date of application.  However, each trade association should report the registration matters of its members, together with the compiled forms, to the respective trade union federation. The trade union federations should forward the reports of the respective trade associations, together with the compiled forms, to the National Federation of Commerce Control. When there are changes or terminations of registration items, the applicant should submit a monthly report to the local competent authority in accordance with the regulations. However, in order to understand the actual situation of major commodity storage, the competent authority will send personnel to inspect warehouses and companies at any time. If the report and the actual storage quantity, address, type, etc. do not match, they will be prosecuted in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>China Film Shareholders Meeting</p>
<p>The China Film Company convened its 32nd annual shareholders meeting yesterday. Chairman Lin Baisheng was in Beijing on official business. Vice Chairman Kawakita Nagamasa, as well as over a thousand directors, supervisors, and shareholders attended. The Vice Chairman proposed that Executive Director Feng Jie be the chairman of the meeting. The chairman first reported on the legality of the meeting quorum and the company's operating status, asset liabilities, and profit surplus for the 32nd year. All present approved without objection. During the general discussion on the re-election of directors, Wu Tong'an (China-Japan Industrial Bank) was unanimously elected. Furthermore, as the term of the supervisors had expired, a re-election was necessary. Wei Nailun, Tang Chengbo, Uemura Taiji, Kitamura Saburo, and Yan Chuntang were unanimously elected as the second term supervisors. Finally, the chairman announced that the proposed capital increase, which was originally planned for discussion at this meeting, had been carefully considered by the joint meeting of directors and supervisors. It was believed that the economic situation had changed drastically in the two months since the call for the meeting, and that it was more appropriate for the company to maintain its original capital and develop gradually, rather than expand and risk potential dangers, which would also be in line with government policy. Therefore, the original proposal for a capital increase would be shelved and not discussed. All present agreed unanimously, and the meeting was adjourned.</p>

<h3>Navy</h3>
<p>— By Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Yang Yi</p>
<p>One day in September, the sound of swords clashing against each other reached Masato. Covered in sweat, he had just finished his exercises and was coming out of the dojo.</p>
<p>"Cadet Tani…there's a telegram for you here?" The adjutant of the company, Major S, personally handed him the telegram, which was something Masato felt unworthy of.</p>
<p>Masato opened the telegram in front of the instructor and saw:</p>
<p>"Takao is missing. If he comes to your place, please let us know – From Takao's Father."</p>
<p>The word "missing" struck Masato's chest with force. He must have changed color--</p>
<p>"What's the matter?" Major S asked. The company adjutant, like an army company commander, also inquired about the private affairs of his subordinates.</p>
<p>Masato did not hide anything and told the instructor everything. Takao, his close friend, had admired the navy since he was a boy. When he failed the physical examination this summer, he was deeply disappointed, and--</p>
<p>"I see…poor child!" After listening, the major said, his words short but filled with emotion.</p>
<p>Three days passed, then a week, but Takao did not come to Etajima.</p>
<p>Masato understood the feelings of his missing friend. He also sympathized with the parents, who only had one son, and imagined the sadness they must be feeling. So, if Takao came to visit, he would definitely find him a hotel in the village and comfort him as much as possible. But no news came, no matter how much he waited.</p>
<p>He could no longer wait and finally sent a telegram to Takao's father.</p>
<p>——Takao hasn't come please provide details</p>
<p>A reply came along with a letter.</p>
<p>According to his father's imagination, Takao may have gone to Masato's place. Takao had disappeared while staying at Kirishima Onsen. Before that, he had sent a letter to his father asking for a lot of money to pay for the hotel room. Although he disappeared with a lot of money, that was not the main reason for his disappearance. The evidence was that before going to Kirishima, he had withdrawn all his savings and taken clothes such as winter underwear. This was all discovered later.</p>
<p>"Serving the country as a citizen is not limited to joining the navy.</p>
<p>Before graduating from middle school, he ran away from home. His stupidity is truly pathetic. But the old man only has one son, and my wife is overcome with grief. If he doesn't go to your place, where will he wander? I am also deeply concerned."</p>
<p>Takao's father's letter was deeply moving. Unlike Masato's family, they had plenty of income and property. No matter what school he attended, it wouldn't be a problem. But running away before graduating from middle school was truly irrational behavior. Sometimes he thought about scolding him, but at the same time, he felt a sense of sympathy for his friend Takao, who had yearned for the navy but ultimately failed and gave up on himself—</p>
<p>(That guy is stubborn...)</p>
<p>Takao, who was nervous and paid attention to trivial matters, but who disregarded everything once he got angry, had a personality opposite to Masato's. Yet, the two of them were particularly close because of this. They were old friends who had played together on the coast of Tenpozan before entering elementary school, so Masato could clearly understand Takao's current feelings. Thinking about his feelings, he could guess that Takao, who had failed the "navy," would not sneak into the gates of the military academy to see him.</p>
<p>"What happened to that child who sent the telegram the other day?" One day, Major S unexpectedly asked this. Masato replied with tears in his eyes.</p>
<p>"I don't think he'll come."</p>
<p>Autumn deepened.</p>
<p>On the orange mountain, as the students called it, oranges and grapefruits were turning yellow. Etajima was famous for its citrus fruits and sweet potatoes, so large red sweet potatoes were often served on the dining tables of the military academy.</p>
<p>"Tani! In your hometown, are Satsuma potatoes also called Satsuma potatoes?" A classmate asked Masato.</p>
<p>"No, we call them Tang potatoes."</p>
<p>"Tang potatoes is a good name. So, what do you call them if you go to Tang (China)?"</p>
<p>"No, then they're Ten (Heavenly) potatoes."</p>
<p>Another classmate imitated Masato's accent, and everyone burst into laughter.</p>
<p>Masato could only smile and endure their teasing, but he felt an infinite sense of loneliness in his heart. It didn't matter whether his classmates laughed at his hometown dialect or not. Satsuma potatoes—seeing Tang potatoes reminded him of the past when he and Takao would roast Tang potatoes on the beach of Tenpozan in winter. They would dig a hole in the sand, light a fire, and roast the sweet potatoes there. The outer skin would be charred, but the center would be pale white--</p>
<p>(Where on earth did you go, Takao...)</p>
<p>Recently, Masato often thought this during his free time or after lights out. Whenever he thought of it, he felt an indescribable emotion.</p>

<h3>Preventing Meningitis Transmission Requires Emphasis on Cleanliness; Nanjing's Garbage Is Fundamentally Unclean</h3>
<p>Recently, there have been cases of infectious meningitis in this city. Although health authorities are making efforts to prevent and control the disease, many people in the vicinity of Nan Shi Li Bin Road have contracted it, and citizens seem to be overlooking this. It is thought that the fundamental way to prevent the epidemic is to emphasize cleanliness, but when looking at Nan Shi, even just speaking of Min Yi Road where I live, the sewers in areas like Gu Jia Heng Kou are blocked, and the filthy water has become stagnant. In the Guang Yi Street Bei Duan area, garbage piles up, almost forming hills. In this early spring, the foul odors are already difficult to bear, and passersby cover their noses. In the coming warmer months, when the scorching sun is burning, what will it be like? I urge the authorities to supervise the residents to thoroughly dredge and manage the area as soon as possible to eliminate hidden dangers. (Sun Yuan)</p>
<p>Reports say that local lockdowns are being implemented separately in the meningitis-affected areas of Nanshi. It is said that "as long as the accumulated filth in Nanshi is not cleared, the source of the chaos will be difficult to eradicate." This sentiment is deeply felt. Upon inspection, garbage mountains accumulate on all streets in Yushi, such as Chenghuang Temple and Houjia Road. Even on the extremely bustling and prosperous Fangbin Road and Fuyou Road, there are piles of garbage. Even behind North King Hospital and Xiaoshijie, the piles are so high that it is impossible to pass, and one must go around them. In this cold weather, meningitis has already become prevalent because of this. If it is summer, the epidemic will inevitably be even worse. The people's livelihood is of utmost importance. The cause of this is partly due to residents' lack of attention to hygiene and dumping of garbage everywhere. And when a garbage pile starts, more follows. Over time, it accumulates into mountains. The other part is the lack of attention from health authorities and the lack of trash bins. Garbage trucks are too few and are not used effectively. They are often only seen on the main streets and not in the small alleys. As a result, all the small streets are even more difficult to navigate due to the filth and dirt. Consequently, the accumulation of filth in Nanshi is increasing, and the epidemic is even worse. It is hoped that the health authorities will thoroughly eliminate this filth. (Yu Naihong)</p>
<p>Treatment for Meningitis</p>
<p>Recently, there has been an epidemic of epidemic meningitis in this city, and people are talking about it with fear. Even mild colds and fevers are mistaken for this disease, causing unwarranted panic. Its main symptoms are fever, vomiting, headache, stiffness in the neck, and impaired consciousness. It is necessary to recognize the two prescriptions of Nie’s, Kuyeqiu and Wenbi, but it is feared that it is not that simple. The Annao Pill formulated by my former teacher, Yun Tieqiao, has a miraculous effect. He advocates that if there is fever, headache, and soreness in the back of the head, and abnormal colors in the eyes, use a combination of Xinliang Jiebao and Longdancao Kujiang, which is really able to eliminate hidden dangers before they happen. It is a good method created by the sages, but the Chinese people often ignore it, which is regrettable. (Zhang Jucai)</p>
<p>Preparation method of "Zao Fan", a special medicine for treating meningitis. Zao Fan is the green alum used in the ancient method of dyeing bright blue, also known as black alum. During the roasting process, select the crystals, remove the gravel, put them in a tile container, and roast them on a charcoal fire. At first, it will turn into a liquid, and when it dries, its color will turn red. Grind it into a fine powder and sift it. Leave it on the ground overnight to remove the fire, and store it in a glass bottle for future use. Patients should not underestimate it simply because it is a simple method. (Liang Yihui)</p>
