<h3>決戰日本的剖視</h3>
<p>問：前幾天我們談過太平洋戰局的問題，但是戰略與政略是一而二二而一，不可分離的。我們旣已檢討日本在戰略上的形勢，而日本國內的政治動態又是怎樣？　　答：關於最近日本國內政治的動態，有兩件事很可以值得注意的。第一件縱政府方面來講，是最高戰爭指導會議的設立；第二件從人民方面來講，是國民運動的一元化。關於前者最高戰爭指導會　的任務，乃是決定指導戰爭的最高根本方針，同時使軍事上的統帥，與政治上的國務，不但能夠得到密切的聯絡，並且更更得以綜合一元化。這是軍事政治的一元化，同時也是表示政戰兩略的一致。關於後者國民運動一元化，自從近衛公提倡新體制以來，即有大政翼贊會的組織；政友會民政黨兩大政黨解散後，也有大政翼贊政治會的組織；此外，同時更有翼贊壯年團的組織，其表面上雖同爲一翼贊會，但實際上卻是多元化的組織，未能達到眞正一元國民運動的理想。所以怎樣使多元爲一元，乃是今後翼政會亦即國民運動的最大任務。總之，政府方面，是力謀軍政上的統一，人民方面，是力謀國民組織的統一，結果上下渾然一體，舉國團結一致，這是小磯內閣成立以來國內政治的特徵。　　問：在今日[增強生產][飛機增產]的聲中，戰時企業所負的任務更大。試問最近日本企業發展的情形如何？　　答：在今日增產運動的聲中，企業所負任務的重大，自不待言。日本整理企業的工作，並不始終今日，不過大規模的整理和改造，還是最近的事。譬如日本最發達的纖維工業，自從經過[企業整備]後，其十分之六以上的工廠，大抵都停工，轉業。至於軍需工業的工廠，則加緊生產，擴大範圍，並且自從軍需省以及軍需公司成立以來，軍需工業的生產，因行政職權之一元化，全部力量之得以集中，所以生產量的增加，是突飛猛進。現　就飛機一項的生產量來講，據日本航空兵器總局長遠藤氏的談話，可以知道日本飛機的生產量，已達到世界第二位，所以國內企業的趨於重點化，正足以表明戰時企業的性格。　　問：軍需工業固有鷺人的進步，但是民間企業和人民生活上最有密切的物價，日本政府是採取何種政策？　　答：軍需工業的發達，固然就是民需工業的減退，可是爲獲取最後的勝利，日本國民是絕對忍受的。不過因整理企業，增強軍需生產時所發生的資金過剩的現象，因而引起物價的上漲時，影響於民生者至大。所以政府所採取的防止對策，並不在如何節省資金，乃在發佈後的流動資金，如何予以收回，如何防止購買力過剩，如何使資金流通圓滑化，使之不失平衡。其最大的方策有二：一是增加租稅，二是發行公債。關於前者，自從大東亞戰爭以來，已經實行數次大增稅案，不論間接稅（如奢侈品稅，消費品稅等）或直接稅（如所得稅），都較前增加數倍之多。關於後者，公債的發行額雖多，但是公債消化問題卻很重要。所以一方面使人民直接認購，一方面極力獎勵人民儲蓄，以圖使全國大小銀行能夠間接消化公債，同時防止浮動購買力的發生，藉以抑制物價的上漲。日本政府自從施行以上種種方策後，國內物價問題毫不嚴重，人民因物價之保持平衡，所以仍能安居樂業，從事生產了。　　問：戰時下最重要的問題，當推民食問題，試問日本國內食糧增產的情形怎樣！　　答：日本政府對於人民的食糧問題，是非常注意的。在過去數次會議之中，也非常注重這個問題。這次舉行的臨時議會，又通過食糧增產所需要的資金十萬萬一千萬圓，與前次議會通過的十七萬萬圓合計共達二十七萬萬圓之多，政府對食糧增產的決心，由此可見。同時日本的配給制度，在組織上非常嚴密，實施上非常合理，加以絕無舞弊等情，所以人民雖處戰時，但對於食糧問題卻毫不感覺到嚴重。　　所以戰時下的日本，無論在政治上，企業上，金融物價上以及在食糧上，都已趨於戰時體製；而政治得到統一，經濟得到統一，同時政戰兩略又得到統一，一切問題自然可迎刃而解了。</p>
<h3>日潛艇在太平洋奇襲敵機動部隊培里琉島日軍深入美陣地</h3>
<p>東京五日中央社電　據中部太平洋日軍某基地電，日潛艇隊四日於摩羅泰島東北海域奇襲敵機動部隊，至其戰果，俟判明後再行發表。　　東京五日中央社電　據中部太平洋日軍某基地電，培里琉島日軍連日夜襲，深入美軍陣地，以肉搏手溜彈炸碎其陣地，予美軍以重創，自九月十三日至十月三日，美軍傷亡不下一萬，按美軍自登陸開始至九月十五日之損失，計達三萬以上。　　東京五日中央社電　據太平洋二日電，培里琉島戰況依然無大變化，日軍確保中央高地一帶，最近敵軍因日軍之反擊，蒙大損失，其作戰亦漸趨愼重。加多普斯島方面，依然繼續激戰。日軍航空部隊一日晚奇襲該島敵軍機塲，該機塲之敵機四十五架，有二十餘架被擊毀，並擊毀運輸艦一艘，此外並轟炸該機塲東北端及南方之軍需品堆積塲，日機全部安返。　　東京五日中央社電　據中部太平洋日軍某基地電，一日下午航行於培里琉島海面之敵驅逐艦一艘，忽發生大火，旋即沉沒。</p>
<h3>日軍使美將兵發生[恐怖感]</h3>
<p>東京五日中央社電　培里琉島日軍作戰之勇猛，極爲世人所稱讚而驚奇，此間軍事消息靈通者，特就此發表談話謂，日軍已使美將兵腦海中樹有[恐怖感]，其言如次：太平洋戰爭現似已集中於培里琉孤島，據當地通訊，敵軍對此環形小島，雖不惜出以龐大兵力及物量，然日軍對敵之抵抗依然熾烈，日軍之英勇抵抗，使敵軍甚感束手。敵軍於塞班島損失之大及大宮·迭尼安兩島所蒙之重創，使敵軍已深知日軍之精強，此事於敵方傳出之消息中，以及敵之官之談話中，已十分明顯，如敵方所言，敵軍尚未與日軍陸上軍精銳部隊正式交綏，艦隊方面亦未作本格之接觸，截至現在，所有之戰爭，僅爲孤島守備隊戰爭或機動艦艇戰爭而已。彼等所企圖染指之菲律賓日軍，正靜待良機中，健在之日軍聯合艦隊，亦在穩重窺時中，[恐怖感]無形中變爲彼等隨身裝飾品，美軍此次蒙受損失，即爲彼等發生[恐怖感]之原因，僅此一點，菲律賓將如何作戰，頗值注目。</p>
<h3>日本元老頭山滿翁逝世生前援助我國革命最力</h3>
<p>東京五日中央社電　據御殿塲電話，久在御殿塲別野靜養中之頭山滿翁，四日下午十一時半逝世，亨年九十，遺骸不日運返東京塋葬。　　東京五日中央社電　頭山滿翁乃爲當代之世界名士，安政二年四月生於福岡縣，三十一歲與峯尾夫人結婚，明治十四年召集鄉土同志，設立育英團體玄洋社，發行福頌新報，主唱大亞洲主義，從事實踐指導，九十年間奔走國事，慶功甚偉，大東亞戰爭爆發後，翁即主張實現東亞人之東亞，並遷居殿塲別墅，遺旗有峯尾夫人（七十五歲）偕秀三等三男，度其一家團聚生活。　　南京五日中央社電　頭山滿翁生於一八八五年，福岡縣人，爲日本在野之有力份子，日本國家主義運動之鼻祖，名滿三島婦孺皆知，人多以頭山翁稱之。早歲於其故鄉福岡糾合同志組織玄洋社，以修習知識，鍛鍊身體爲宗皆，期能於有事之秋獻身國家，在其門下人材輩出，當甲午日俄兩戰役時，活動甚力，後在東京創立浪人會，此爲玄洋社社員中非福岡出身者，氏體　魁偉，性情慷慨，會賢其在北海道之煤礦，得款八十萬元，除一部份清理債務，餘悉分與左右親近之人，其在今日所以集有多數門徒，而得爲各方崇敬之在野名流者，蓋職此之故。一九二四年，嘗奉旨入宮，特賜御前侍宴，以一布衣獲此恩寵，談者每謂開未有之先例，氏與我國　國父及革命先友頗多往還，時來我國，間亦於報章雜誌發表論著。</p>
<h3>陳代主席發表感想</h3>
<p>（中央社滬訊）日元老頭山滿翁於昨日六時逝世消息傳至我國後，全國朝野一致表示驚悼，國府陳代主席以頭山滿翁生前爰助我國革命，慶功甚偉，爲追念其一生精神道德，特發表感想如次：　　今日倏聞山滿老溘然逝世，殊令吾人痛悼與追思不已，頭山先生不祗日本民間領導人之元老，亦爲參與中國革命之元老，中國辛亥革命肇造民國，頭山先生援助之功實多，孫先生與汪先生同視頭山先生爲革命上之摯友，而吾人更視先生爲革命之先輩，余於二十九年及三十二年赴日答禮，均赴先生之居致敬，并領其教益，初不料今日遂以高齡而與世長辭也。中日本爲兄弟之國，事變起後，先生無日不在懸憂之中，亦無日不以中日早日能復和平爲念，今日雖國府還都四年，中日同盟條約亦在於去年締結，已奠中日兩國永久和平之基，然而全面和平迄未實現，余知先生必引爲遺憾，而未能瞑目者，仰望頭山先生之後人及吾輩革命後進，當以先生之志爲志，而努力於兩國人民之了解及合作與和平，庶乎無負此革命元老之初衷，而貫澈兩國同志之抱負也。</p>
<h3>王克敏氏發表談話</h3>
<p>北平五日中央社電日頭山滿翁逝世後，噩耗傳來，華北官民莫不深爲痛惜，國府華北政務委員長王克敏氏五日特發表談話，其大意謂：當茲大東亞戰爭將欲完成及中國方見復興曙光之際，盟邦巨人頭山滿翁突然逝世，聞訃之餘，不勝痛惜，翁實爲吾人銘記難忘之偉人，且爲襄助中國革命運動之最有力者，昔國父孫先生亡命日本時，翁會極力爲之庇護，中國革命之指導者，幾無未受翁之恩惠者，昨年余訪日時，會獲交於先生，故對先生於中國革命史上之豐功偉績，至爲感謝云。</p>
<h3>我革命先進談話</h3>
<p>南京五日中央社電據東京來電，日頭山翁已於四日下午作古，吾國朝野各方聞訊後，無不深爲悼惜，記者以頭山翁與吾國革命有極深關係，因走訪革命先進及熟曉革命史料人士，叩詢頭山翁與國父及中國革命之關係，茲綜合摘記如次：　　頭山翁爲日本在野名流，爲　國父生前好友，他會經到中國來過，帮忙國父策劃中國革命，那時到上海去迎接頭山翁的便是今日繼續　國父遺忘與日本携手，共謀大東亞解放的國府主席　汪先生，因此當民國三十年夏主席訪問日本之際，特往東就澀谷區常盤松一丁目二番地頭山翁私宅，作久別重逢的談話，當頭山翁與　汪主席在中日携手求共存共榮時局下握手之際，想起當年協助中國革命，帮忙　國父策劃革命的情形，兩人都不勝感慨，從而愈信中日之應相互提携，以共謀發展。　　翁爲日本民間須袖不僅爲日本之志士，實亦爲中國革命之友，與中國諸革命人士相往還，且協力頗多，當　國父初時革命失敗，亡命海外，不幸有（倫敦蒙難）幾罹不測，，遂東赴日本，重建革命策源地，國父在其所著孫文學識第八童，有志竟成文中有稱：[不欲久處歐洲曠廢革命時日，藉經日本，以其地與中國接近消息，便於籌劃，也隨而識在野志士如頭山各志士，對中國革命事業先後都有賴助，此爲國父識頭山翁之始。後同盟會成立於東京，日本遂成爲中國革命本部所在地，多方得日本朝野人士之贊助，予以便利，或代爲奔走，頭山翁爲其中有力份子，當辛亥革命武昌起義成功時，國父尚尚留海外，萱野長知自漢口電頭山翁·轉請　國父歸國並請寺尾博士來華協助，起革憲法。　國父於歸國途中歷防英法等國，各國以我國革命大勢已成，不得不表示相當同情之意。國父歸國抵滬之前，盛傳國父携帶鉅款歸國，故中外新聞界特以此事相詢，國父莞爾答曰：[余未帶一文，帶回者惟革命精神而已。革命之目的不達，絕不議和。]國父抵滬上陸時歡迎者如潮沸，其中頭山翁即於數日前自日來滬，挿於人叢中，表示熱烈之歡迎，其後　國父於二次革命失敗後，復赴日本。萱野長知氏獲　國父自船中來電，即轉告翁，翁謂君可速往，使孫先生安心，前次孫先生來日，備受日本朝野熱誠歡迎，尤以實業家爭先歡迎之，今孫君受窘，並無一人願助之故，但對實業家極其厭惡，爲協助中國革命，吾等正應於此時極力歡迎，孫先生向無私蓄，故此來身邊恐無一文，請會晤時詢之，並轉告彼余將設法帮助]由此數語足見頭山翁對於中國革命贊助之熱情亦可想而知。</p>
<h3>日軍距福州僅九公里</h3>
<p>廣州五日中央社電據重慶電，渝軍委會四日夜之發表中，已承認日軍自九月廿七日於福建沿岸登陸後，於三日已進至距福州九公里之地點。對此四日之重慶各外電，會發表消息如次：日軍自本年四月來展開之新作戰，其目的與企圖現已愈趨顯明，即一方爲剿滅渝美空軍基地，同時並強化對太平洋方面尼米茲攻勢之防備，實足駭嘆。又渝軍委會同時並發表，湘桂鐵路之要衝興安，已被日軍攻陷云。</p>
<h3>西江擊落美機多架</h3>

<h3>太平洋戰局有利於日本</h3>
<p>松島部長在京談話　　南京五日中央社電　日本海軍報道部長松島大佐，日前來京，於五日三時半，　海軍武官府，接見中國記者團，對最近之戰局方面，闡述至爲詳盡，茲誌其談話如後：現在美國的攻勢，在帛琉羣島及菲島的近海，這次美國在帛琉羣島戰爭中，蒙受重大之損害以後，在菲島方面，想亦將蒙受同樣之打擊。美國在帛琉羣島之培里琉島之損失，依面積計算之，平均每一平方哩約損失四百十七人，爲前塞班島損失之七倍。今後美軍在菲律賓作戰，當將更感困難。此後之美國戰略，似在突過菲律賓而入中國大陸，利用中國大陸之人力·物力，以與日本決戰。因欲達此目的，乃一方面在印度增強空輸，一方面在渝美空軍發動游擊戰，以爲響應。在長江流域及華南方面，不時發動空襲，在日本北方（阿留地安羣島一帶），亦當有敵機來襲，天時即將入多，想當亦不至有若何戰爭。　　在太平洋方面，美海軍會襲西蘭島，其目的在與尼米資所統率之美海軍太平洋艦隊，協力作戰，予日本側面以一威脅。但至現在爲止，尚無任何積極表示。在　北克會談時，羅邱會有所決定，在歐戰結束後，將歐戰塲之陸海空軍全部移到太平洋方面之談話，似屬可能。但縱觀邇來英美蘇間之自相磨擦情形，而似又不可能。英美攻擊日本之戰局，似以其最後之兵力來決戰，今日之決戰飛機佔最重要之地位，故日本對飛機增產，在積極進行中。日本最近之</p>
<h3>飛機生產</h3>
<p>與美國能用在太平洋前綫之機數多出數倍。以前美國飛機基地爲夏威夷及馬紹爾，今再向西移，其補給綫當益長，帛琉羣島方面，美國之補給力，抵帛里琉島止，已達最高點，倘再延長下去，即不可能。同時在美國補給綫日益增長，日本飛機生產增強之時，故今後戰爭，日本實有充分之把握。現在太平洋戰爭，此實爲有利於日本作戰者。再者關於英美軍在中國大陸登陸問題，在美國感到最困難者，爲人力不足，所以美國希望利用</p>
<h3>中國大陸</h3>
<p>的根據地，以中國之人力，自己之武器，來與日本決戰。日本海軍現在從事防止美國此項企圖。英美在華登陸，且有增加中國人民痛苦，即能實現，中國之人力物力將先受嚴重損害，然後中日兩國均將蒙受深刻打擊。因此吾人站在東亞民族之立塲上說，重慶實非日本的敵人，日本的敵人是在渝方後方操縱者的美國。日艦隊現仍保持有開戰以來強大之實力，並爲避以來強大之實力，並爲避以來強大之實力，並爲避免無謂犧牲計，現正在等待最好的時機出動，以期予敵人以潰滅打擊。羅斯福與尼米資對日本艦隊。</p>
<h3>未受損害</h3>
<p>頗爲擔心，現在之日本艦隊，正抱必勝決心，等待時機。塞班島大宮島迭尼安島之戰爭，對整個戰爭，決無影響。現在日海軍正以擊滅英美實力爲目標，在積極待機中。爲防止中國淪爲戰塲，爲防止中國墜入義國之悲慘之命運，在海上積極準備中。日陸軍在溫州福州登陸，亦爲協力日本海軍之保衛中國大陸作戰。今日美國在太平洋上</p>
<h3>海軍勢力</h3>
<p>據美國軍事家發表，約數爲制式航空母艦十艘，商船改造之航空母艦卅艘，可能在第一綫之戰艦八艘，舊式戰艦四艘或五艘。在活動之潛水艇約五十艘，巡洋艦三十及驅逐艦。但自培里琉附近戰況看來，其戰鬥力已達最高度，再事增加，已不可能。況今日之海戰，已與過去之以戰艦多數爲中心之海戰，同樣必須與大陸各航空基地保持</p>
<h3>密切連絡</h3>
<p>，始克有必勝之把握。而日本在海戰上確已把握此點，故日本海軍早已集中兵力，等待適當之機會，一舉而擊滅之。關於美軍登陸問題，在其攻擊　班島時，已受極大損失，故其果若在菲律賓登陸，必須出動百萬兵力，如其果眞出動百萬美兵，前必須出動一千五百萬噸船舶力，如以一小時行十四海里計算，則從夏威夷運輸至菲律賓，須一月之長時間，始能往還，況其途中無良好軍港停泊，更缺較佳之修理船廠，故其運輸補給問題，實有</p>
<h3>極大困難</h3>
<p>反之·日本之補給綫旣短，而大陸航空基地，均在我掌握之中，故我人深信，太平洋戰局無論從何方面言，均有利於我也。惟有一點，國民必須注意者，即我日本海軍，正傾全力防止美海軍在中國登陸，蓋其人力不足，欲以中國人力作戰，欲以中國土地作爲戰塲，而其在中國登陸後，中國人民必將更加深痛苦，一切貴國國民，深爲認識此點，予以協力，而爲大東亞整個民族幸福計，吾人亦深信貴國國民，能傾全力協助也。</p>

<h3>會談一小時與王克敏氏</h3>
<p>— 武公</p>
<p>九月二十五日在北京巳充滿了秋意，記者就在那天下午晉謁華北政務委員會委員長王克敏先生。記者准三時半到了以前的外交大樓，這就是現在華北政務委員會的官署所在。這裹的建築是造得十分華麗的，原是當年北京政府時代招待外寶的所在，所以當記者踏進委員長的會客室時，覩其內部裝璜就深深地浮起一層歐洲宮殿的印象　　在會客室從沒多久，我已聽到一種信步而來的足聲，一位精神瞿鑠的老練政治家的側影已出現我的眼前。　　[我們已有一年多沒有見面了，]一種帶着廣東口音的官話聲調，巳從這位老練政治家口中發出了。我當時就默想着這位我國的頭號要人，畢竟他的記憶力很強吧，雖然因了他盲一目的緣故，終年迫着他戴一付黑色眼鏡。　　[正因爲我是想來看看華北方面的經濟情形的，所以很希望能夠曉得一些這兒的實情。]</p>
<h3>統制經濟問題</h3>
<p>[說到經濟，]王氏咬着牙齒說：[今日正復何從談起，不過能夠去除一些人爲的障礙總是好的。在這裹我不是反對統制經濁，不過在經濟落後的中國，鄉材旣和城市隔閣，人口又無法清查，所謂統制便不能不作有因地制宜人考慮吧。否則如果硬在實行和先進國一般無二的統制，實有和統制的始意背道而馳的危險。]　　[本年夏天起]，我接着說：[華中方面對於食糧統制已首先緩和，不過結果也並不能使米價回跌。]　　[所謂緩和統制，這不能單指米糧而言的，]王氏想了一想說：[抽意以爲在米糧之外各物都不必有人爲的統制，至於米價的調節又端賴所有如我國古　時的所謂社倉與平羅的制度。]　　[現在北方的食糧問題，似乎較前進步了一些吧？]我問。　　[是的，]他劃着火柴一面在吸雪茄烟：[一年以前這裹配給混合粉的故事今已成爲過去了。]　　[那末，]我追問：[這裹的鄉村情形怎樣？]</p>
<h3>鄉村情形一斑</h3>
<p>[誠然如外面所說，]王氏回答：[道裹的鄉村難免有八路軍的蹤跡，但一般老百姓只知道誰眞愛民不擾民便可與誰合作的。]　　[這裹公務員的待遇，最近也改善了一些嗎？]記者又換了一個話題。　　[是的，]王氏緊接着說：[去年十二月與本年四月都已有過兩次的改善，現在我們正在商討再度的增加津貼。去年的官俸已達二千萬元，本年四月後便境加到三千多萬元，最近我們已製定了兩個方案：一個方案規定爲一萬萬元，另一個方案則規定爲六千多萬元。]　　[你是在說，增加官俸嗎？]我又問了。　　[不是官俸，]他明白地告訴我：[我們這兒的文武官員俸給還是依照事變前所規定的章程辦理，現在增加的是指生活津貼而言，因爲後者可依時而遞增的。]　　[委員長，你也關心我國的全面和平嗎？]我看他很健談，於是提出了一個新鮮的題目。　　[能和平當然是好的，]他說：[但現在這巳顯然越出了中日兩國的事了！]　　[這次宇垣大將來華，想來你也見過了，]我再問。　　[是的，]他答：[但我們並沒有談到什麼具體的話，只是來華看一回吧！]　　[可是最近渝方的國際地位日益低落確是不能否認的事，]王氏毫沒有倦容娓娓而談：[就是美國最近也毫無忌憚地在發動對渝的攻訏輿論了，不過政府方面卻還在裝做疾聾。]　　[當然，]我說：[這一次日軍的大陸進攻對渝方是一個慘重的打擊。]　　[可是，]他繼續下去：[這個慘重打擊還不如他們在國際地位所受到的影響來得厲害。]　　[那末，]我問：[我國的前途在這種國際演變中豈非很苦悶嗎？]　　[抗戰沒有絕對的希望，]王氏坦白地說：[和平也難道很容易有進展嗎？這確是一種絕大的苦悶。我們如果不協助盟邦完成決戰的最後勝利，則前途益發難以設想。]　　[是的，]我說：[昨天在決戰文學者大會席上，竹田報道部長也會說過：如果我們萬一失敗則蘇軍必然會到滿洲來謀發展的。這是一個眞實的危險吧！]　　[聽說汪主席的病況有些起色吧，]我終於轉入另一話題。</p>
<h3>關心主席病況</h3>
<p>[是的，]他說：[我們這裹也會派人去探視，當主席看到他時，會和他緊緊地握着手，且殷勤地問着華北方面的政情。主席的聲調很清楚，我們都希望他早日健康返國親理政事。]　　[我們在去年十一月二十日召開宣傳會議的時候，汪主席會親臨致辭，]我帶着傷感情調說：[萬不料到一月後他就不能在短期內重和我們相叙了！]　　[這實在不勝今昔之感，]王氏也感傷地嘆息着。　　[我和主席小時都每天見面，後來因爲政治路綫不同所以例疏遠了。]　　[難道委員長那時也在廣東嗎？]我問。　　[我是在廣東生長的，]他說：[那時主席大槪九歲，我是十六歲，他在他的哥哥伯新處就讀，我在一位姓趙的先生處就讀，我們在路上是每天逢到的！]　　[委員長高壽多少？]我問。　　[虛度六十有九了！]他笑着說。　　[你的精神還是那麼壯健，]我也笑著說：[看來比年餘前我們見面時倒還要覺得容光煥發。]　　[人事那裹有一定，]王氏似乎最初感到有些消極，[你去年十一月裹不是還見到汪主席的麼？你那時也何嘗會料到一月以後的變化呢？]　　說到這裹，我深感到時間憶經過長，於是再略談些無關重要的事和王氏握別。</p>

        <h1>1944 - n276</h1>
<h3>An Analysis of the Decisive Battle with Japan</h3>
<p>Q: The other day we discussed the situation in the Pacific War, but strategy and politics are two sides of the same coin and cannot be separated. Now that we have examined Japan's strategic situation, what is the political situation within Japan?</p>
<p>A: Regarding recent political developments in Japan, two things are noteworthy. First, from the government's perspective, is the establishment of the Supreme War Leadership Council; second, from the people's perspective, is the unification of the national movement. Concerning the former, the mission of the Supreme War Leadership Council is to determine the highest fundamental policy for guiding the war, and at the same time, to ensure that military command and political affairs are not only closely linked, but also integrated and unified. This is the unification of military and political affairs, and also represents the consistency of political and military strategies. Regarding the latter, the unification of the national movement, since Prince Konoe advocated the New Order, there has been the organization of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association; after the dissolution of the two major political parties, the Seiyukai and the Minseito, there has also been the organization of the Imperial Rule Assistance Political Association; in addition, there is also the organization of the Imperial Rule Assistance Youth Corps. Although they appear to be the same Imperial Rule Assistance Association on the surface, they are actually pluralistic organizations that have failed to achieve the ideal of a truly unified national movement. Therefore, how to unify the plural into the singular is the greatest task of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, that is, the national movement, from now on. In short, the government is striving for the unification of military and political affairs, and the people are striving for the unification of national organizations. As a result, the upper and lower levels are completely integrated, and the whole country is united. This is a characteristic of the domestic politics since the establishment of the Koiso Cabinet.</p>
<p>Q: Today, amid the calls for [increased production] and [increased aircraft production], wartime enterprises bear an even greater responsibility. What is the recent development of Japanese enterprises?</p>
<p>A: Today, amid the calls for increased production, the importance of the tasks undertaken by enterprises goes without saying. Japan's work to reorganize enterprises did not begin today, but the large-scale reorganization and transformation are still recent events. For example, Japan's most developed textile industry, after [enterprise consolidation], has largely shut down or converted more than six-tenths of its factories. As for the factories of the munitions industry, they are stepping up production and expanding their scope. Since the establishment of the Ministry of Munitions and munitions companies, the production of the munitions industry has increased rapidly due to the unification of administrative powers and the concentration of all forces. Regarding the production volume of aircraft alone, according to the remarks of Mr. Endo, Director-General of the Japanese Aviation Weapons Bureau, it can be known that Japan's aircraft production volume has reached the second place in the world. Therefore, the tendency of domestic enterprises to focus on key points is sufficient to show the characteristics of wartime enterprises.</p>
<p>Q: The munitions industry has indeed made progress, but what policies does the Japanese government adopt regarding prices, which are most closely related to private enterprises and people's lives?</p>
<p>A: The development of the munitions industry naturally means the decline of the civilian goods industry, but to win the final victory, the Japanese people are absolutely enduring. However, when the surplus of funds generated during the reorganization of enterprises and the increase in munitions production causes prices to rise, the impact on people's livelihoods is significant. Therefore, the government's countermeasures are not aimed at saving funds, but at how to recover the released circulating funds, how to prevent excess purchasing power, and how to smooth the flow of funds so as not to lose balance. The two largest policies are: first, to increase taxes; and second, to issue public bonds. Regarding the former, since the Greater East Asia War, several major tax increase plans have been implemented, and both indirect taxes (such as luxury taxes, consumer goods taxes, etc.) and direct taxes (such as income taxes) have increased several times more than before. Regarding the latter, although the amount of public bonds issued is large, the issue of public bond digestion is very important. Therefore, on the one hand, the people are directly encouraged to purchase them, and on the other hand, the people are vigorously encouraged to save, so that large and small banks across the country can indirectly digest public bonds, while preventing the occurrence of floating purchasing power, thereby suppressing the rise in prices. Since the Japanese government implemented the above measures, the domestic price problem has not been serious, and the people are still able to live and work in peace and contentment because of the balance of prices.</p>
<p>Q: The most important issue in wartime is the people's food supply. What is the situation of food production increase in Japan?</p>
<p>A: The Japanese government pays great attention to the people's food problem. It has also paid great attention to this issue in several past meetings. The temporary parliament held this time also passed 1.1 billion yen needed for food production increase. Together with the 1.7 billion yen passed by the previous parliament, the total amount reached 2.7 billion yen, which shows the government's determination to increase food production. At the same time, Japan's rationing system is very strict in organization and very rational in implementation, and there is no corruption or other circumstances at all, so the people do not feel the food problem is serious even in wartime.</p>
<p>Therefore, Japan in wartime, whether in politics, business, finance, prices, or food, has moved towards a wartime system; and politics has been unified, the economy has been unified, and at the same time, political and military strategies have been unified, and all problems can naturally be solved easily.</p>
<h3>Japanese Submarines Surprise Enemy Task Force in the Pacific, Japanese Troops on Peleliu Island Penetrate American Positions</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a Japanese base in the central Pacific, Japanese submarines ambushed an enemy task force on the 4th in the sea northeast of Morotai Island. The results of the battle will be announced after confirmation.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a Japanese base in the central Pacific, Japanese troops on Peleliu Island have been launching night attacks for days, penetrating American positions, destroying them with hand-to-hand combat and hand grenades, inflicting heavy losses on the American forces. From September 13th to October 3rd, American casualties were no less than 10,000. It is estimated that American losses from the start of the landing to September 15th reached over 30,000.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from the Pacific on the 2nd, the battle situation on Peleliu Island remains largely unchanged. Japanese troops are securing the central highlands area. Recently, enemy troops have suffered heavy losses due to Japanese counterattacks, and their operations have gradually become more cautious. On the Guadalcanal Island front, fierce fighting continues. On the evening of the 1st, Japanese air units ambushed the enemy airfield on the island. Of the 45 enemy aircraft at the airfield, more than 20 were destroyed. A transport ship was also destroyed. In addition, the northeast end and southern military supplies depots of the airfield were bombed. All Japanese aircraft returned safely.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a Japanese base in the central Pacific, an enemy destroyer sailing off Peleliu Island caught fire suddenly on the afternoon of the 1st and soon sank.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Cause [Terror] Among American Soldiers</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) - The bravery of Japanese troops in combat on Peleliu Island has been praised and surprised by the world. A well-informed military source here made the following comments, saying that Japanese troops have instilled a sense of [terror] in the minds of American soldiers: The Pacific War now seems to be concentrated on the isolated island of Peleliu. According to local reports, although the enemy is sparing no effort in terms of manpower and material resources on this ring-shaped island, Japanese resistance remains fierce. The heroic resistance of the Japanese troops has left the enemy feeling very helpless. The enemy's large losses on Saipan Island and the heavy damage suffered on Tinian and Guam islands have made the enemy deeply aware of the strength of the Japanese troops. This is evident in the enemy's news reports and the enemy officers' conversations. As the enemy says, the enemy has not yet formally engaged the elite troops of the Japanese army on land, and the fleet has not made any full-scale contact. Until now, all the wars have been only wars of isolated island garrisons or wars of mobile warships. The Japanese troops in the Philippines, which they are trying to get their hands on, are waiting for a good opportunity, and the surviving Japanese Combined Fleet is also steadily watching for an opportunity. [Terror] has invisibly become an accessory they carry with them. The losses suffered by the American army this time are the reason why they are experiencing [terror]. Given this, how the Philippines will be fought deserves attention.</p>
<h3>Japanese Elder Toyama Mitsuru Passes Away, Aided Our Country's Revolution Most Vigorously During His Lifetime</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) - According to a telephone call from Gotemba, Toyama Mitsuru, who had been recuperating at his villa in Gotemba for a long time, passed away at 11:30 p.m. on the 4th. He was 90 years old. His remains will be transported back to Tokyo for burial in the near future.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) - Toyama Mitsuru was a world-renowned figure of the contemporary era. He was born in Fukuoka Prefecture in April of the second year of the Ansei era. At the age of 31, he married Mrs. Mineo. In the 14th year of the Meiji era, he gathered his hometown comrades and established the Genyosha, an educational organization, and published the Fukusho Shinpo, advocating Pan-Asianism and engaging in practical guidance. For 90 years, he devoted himself to national affairs, and his achievements were very great. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the elder advocated the realization of East Asia for East Asians and moved to a villa in Tenba. He lived a family life with his wife Mineo (75 years old) and three sons, including Shuzo.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency) - Toyama Mitsuru was born in 1885 in Fukuoka Prefecture. He was a powerful figure outside the Japanese government, the founder of the Japanese nationalist movement, and his name was known to women and children on the three islands. People often refer to him as Elder Toyama. Early in his career, he organized the Genyosha with like-minded people in his hometown of Fukuoka, with the aim of studying knowledge and exercising to dedicate themselves to the country in times of emergency. Many talented people emerged from his ranks. During the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese Wars, he was very active. Later, he founded the Ronin Association in Tokyo, which was composed of members of the Genyosha who were not from Fukuoka. He had a tall figure and a generous personality. He acquired 800,000 yen from his coal mine in Hokkaido. After clearing some of his debts, he distributed the rest to his close associates. This is why he has gathered a large number of disciples today and has become a respected non-governmental celebrity from all walks of life. In 1924, he was once summoned to the palace by imperial order and was specially granted an audience with the emperor. Observers often said that this unprecedented favor was unprecedented for a commoner. He had a lot of contact with our country's Father of the Nation and revolutionary comrades. He came to our country from time to time and also published articles in newspapers and magazines.</p>
<h3>Acting Chairman Chen Expresses His Sentiments</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Shanghai) After the news of the death of Japanese elder Toyama Mitsuru at 6 p.m. yesterday reached our country, the whole country, both government and public, expressed their shock and condolences. Acting Chairman Chen of the National Government, in order to commemorate his lifelong spirit and morality, as Toyama Mitsuru had assisted our country's revolution and his achievements were very great during his lifetime, especially issued the following sentiments: Today, I suddenly heard that Elder Toyama has passed away, which makes us extremely saddened and nostalgic. Mr. Toyama is not only a veteran leader of the Japanese people, but also a veteran who participated in the Chinese revolution. The Chinese Revolution of 1911 created the Republic of China, and Mr. Toyama's assistance was very great. Mr. Sun and Mr. Wang both regarded Mr. Toyama as a close friend of the revolution, and we regard Mr. Toyama as a senior of the revolution. I went to Japan in the 29th and 32nd years to pay my respects and received his teachings. I never expected that he would pass away at such an old age today. China and Japan are brotherly countries. Since the Incident, the elder has been worried every day and has been thinking about the early restoration of peace between China and Japan. Although the National Government returned to the capital four years ago, and the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty was also concluded last year, laying the foundation for permanent peace between China and Japan, full peace has not yet been realized. I know that the elder must regret this and will not be able to rest in peace. I hope that the descendants of Mr. Toyama and we revolutionary juniors will take the elder's will as our own and strive for the understanding, cooperation, and peace of the people of the two countries, so that we will not fail the original intention of this revolutionary elder and implement the aspirations of the comrades of the two countries.</p>
<h3>Wang Kemin Speaks</h3>
<p>Beiping, 5th (Central News Agency) After the news of the death of Japanese elder Toyama Mitsuru was received, officials and civilians in North China deeply regretted it. Wang Kemin, Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Committee of the National Government, issued a statement on the 5th, the gist of which was: At a time when the Greater East Asia War is about to be completed and the dawn of China's revival is in sight, the sudden death of the Allied giant Toyama Mitsuru is deeply regrettable. The elder is a great man that we will never forget, and he was the most powerful supporter of the Chinese revolutionary movement. In the past, when the Father of the Nation, Mr. Sun, was in exile in Japan, the elder did his best to protect him. Almost all the leaders of the Chinese revolution have benefited from the elder's favor. When I visited Japan last year, I had the opportunity to meet with the elder, so I am very grateful for the elder's great achievements in the history of the Chinese revolution.</p>
<h3>Our Revolutionary Forerunners Speak</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency) According to a dispatch from Tokyo, the Japanese Elder Toyama passed away on the afternoon of the 4th. After hearing the news, all parties in our country deeply mourned him. As the reporter had a very deep relationship with the Chinese revolution, he visited revolutionary forerunners and people familiar with revolutionary historical materials to inquire about the relationship between Elder Toyama and the Father of the Nation and the Chinese revolution. The following is a summary of the notes: Elder Toyama was a well-known figure outside the Japanese government and a close friend of the Father of the Nation during his lifetime. He had been to China to help the Father of the Nation plan the Chinese revolution. It was Mr. Wang, the current Chairman of the National Government, who continued the Father of the Nation's legacy and joined hands with Japan to seek the liberation of Greater East Asia, who went to Shanghai to welcome Elder Toyama at that time. Therefore, when the Chairman visited Japan in the summer of the 30th year of the Republic of China, he specially went to the private residence of Elder Toyama at No. 2, 1-chome, Tokiwamatsu, Shibuya Ward, to have a long-awaited reunion. When Elder Toyama and Chairman Wang shook hands in the situation of Sino-Japanese cooperation for co-existence and co-prosperity, they recalled the situation of assisting the Chinese revolution and helping the Father of the Nation plan the revolution in those years. They were both filled with emotion and became more convinced that China and Japan should support each other to seek common development. The elder is not only a Japanese patriot, but also a friend of the Chinese revolution. He had contacts with many Chinese revolutionaries and cooperated a lot. When the Father of the Nation initially failed in the revolution and went into exile overseas, unfortunately, he almost suffered an accident (the London incident). Therefore, he went east to Japan to rebuild the base of the revolution. The Father of the Nation mentioned in the article "Where There is a Will, There is a Way" in the eighth part of Sun Wenxue Shishi: "[I did not want to stay in Europe for a long time and waste the days of the revolution. I passed through Japan, because the location was close to China and news was easy to plan. I also got to know patriots in the opposition, such as Toyama and other patriots, who had helped the Chinese revolution one after another.] This was the beginning of the Father of the Nation's knowledge of Elder Toyama. Later, the Tongmenghui was established in Tokyo, and Japan became the headquarters of the Chinese revolution. It received the support and convenience of people from all walks of life in Japan, or helped to run around on their behalf. Elder Toyama was a powerful figure among them. When the Wuchang Uprising of the Xinhai Revolution was successful, the Father of the Nation was still overseas. Kayano Nagachika telegraphed Elder Toyama from Hankou to ask the Father of the Nation to return to China and to ask Dr. Terao to come to China to assist in drafting the constitution. On his way home, the Father of the Nation passed through England, France, and other countries. All countries expressed considerable sympathy because they believed that the trend of the Chinese revolution had been established. Before the Father of the Nation arrived in Shanghai, it was rumored that the Father of the Nation had brought a large sum of money back to the country, so the Chinese and foreign press specifically inquired about this matter. The Father of the Nation smiled and replied: [I did not bring a penny, I only brought back the spirit of the revolution. If the purpose of the revolution is not achieved, I will never negotiate peace.] When the Father of the Nation landed in Shanghai, he was welcomed by a crowd of people. Among them, Elder Toyama came to Shanghai from Japan a few days ago and mingled in the crowd, expressing his warm welcome. Later, after the Father of the Nation failed in the Second Revolution, he went to Japan again. Kayano Nagachika received a telegram from the Father of the Nation from the ship and told the elder. The elder said, 'You can go quickly and reassure Mr. Sun. The last time Mr. Sun came to Japan, he received a warm welcome from all walks of life in Japan, especially the industrialists competed to welcome him. Now that Mr. Sun is in trouble, no one is willing to help him. Therefore, I am extremely disgusted with the industrialists. In order to assist the Chinese revolution, we should do our best to welcome him at this time. Mr. Sun has never had any private savings, so I am afraid he does not have a penny with him this time. Please ask him when you meet him, and tell him that I will find a way to help him.] These few words are enough to show Elder Toyama's enthusiasm for supporting the Chinese revolution.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Only Nine Kilometers from Fuzhou</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 5th (Central News Agency) According to a Chongqing telegram, the Chongqing Military Commission announced on the night of the 4th that Japanese troops, after landing on the coast of Fujian on September 27th, had advanced to a point only nine kilometers from Fuzhou on the 3rd. Regarding this, various foreign telegrams in Chongqing published the following news on the 4th: The purpose and intention of the new offensive launched by the Japanese army since April of this year have become increasingly clear, that is, on the one hand, to eliminate the US Air Force bases in Chongqing, and at the same time to strengthen the defense against Nimitz's offensive in the Pacific, which is truly alarming.

<h3>The Pacific War Situation is Favorable to Japan</h3>
<p>Director Matsushima Speaks in Nanjing</p>
<p>Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency) Colonel Matsushima, Director of the Japanese Naval Press Department, came to Nanjing a few days ago. At 3:30 on the 5th, at the Japanese Naval Attaché's Office, he received the Chinese press corps and explained the recent war situation in great detail. The following is a record of his remarks: The current American offensive is in the vicinity of the Palau Islands and the Philippine Islands. After suffering heavy damage in the war in the Palau Islands, the United States is likely to suffer the same setbacks in the Philippines. According to area calculations, the American losses on Peleliu Island in the Palau Islands averaged about 417 people per square mile, which is seven times the losses on Saipan Island. It will be even more difficult for the U.S. military to fight in the Philippines in the future. The future American strategy seems to be to break through the Philippines and enter the Chinese mainland, using the manpower and material resources of the Chinese mainland to fight a decisive battle with Japan. In order to achieve this goal, they are increasing air transport in India on the one hand, and launching guerrilla warfare with the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing on the other hand, in order to respond. Air raids are launched from time to time in the Yangtze River basin and South China. There will also be enemy aircraft attacking in the north of Japan (the Aleutian Islands area). As the weather is about to turn bad, it is unlikely that there will be much warfare. In the Pacific, the U.S. Navy will attack Zealand, with the aim of cooperating with the U.S. Navy's Pacific Fleet, commanded by Nimitz, to pose a threat to Japan's flank. But so far, there has been no active indication. At the Quebec Conference, there was a decision by Luo Qiu to move all the land, sea, and air forces from the European battlefield to the Pacific after the end of the European war, which seems possible. But judging from the recent friction between the UK, the US, and the Soviet Union, it seems impossible again. The UK and the US seem to be using their last forces to fight a decisive battle to attack Japan. Today, the decisive battle for aircraft occupies the most important position, so Japan is actively increasing aircraft production.</p>
<h3>Aircraft Production</h3>
<p>is several times higher than the number of aircraft that the United States can use on the Pacific front. In the past, the U.S. aircraft bases were Hawaii and the Marshall Islands. Now they are moving further west, and their supply lines will become longer. In the Palau Islands, the U.S. supply capacity has reached its peak at Peleliu Island. If it is extended further, it will be impossible. At the same time, when the U.S. supply lines are growing longer and longer and Japan's aircraft production is increasing, Japan is fully confident in the war in the future. The Pacific War is now advantageous for Japan. Furthermore, regarding the issue of British and American forces landing on the Chinese mainland, the most difficult thing for the United States is the shortage of manpower, so the United States hopes to use</p>
<h3>Chinese Mainland</h3>
<p>as a base, using Chinese manpower and their own weapons to fight a decisive battle with Japan. The Japanese Navy is now preventing the United States from this attempt. If the British and Americans land in China, it will increase the suffering of the Chinese people. Even if it is realized, China's manpower and material resources will first suffer serious damage, and then both China and Japan will suffer profound blows. Therefore, standing on the position of the East Asian nation, Chongqing is not Japan's enemy, Japan's enemy is the United States, which is manipulating behind the Chongqing side. The Japanese fleet still maintains the strong strength it has had since the beginning of the war, and in order to avoid unnecessary sacrifices, it is now waiting for the best opportunity to move out and give the enemy a crushing blow. Roosevelt and Nimitz are targeting the Japanese fleet.</p>
<h3>Undamaged</h3>
<p>It is quite worrying that the current Japanese fleet, holding a determination to win, awaits its opportunity. The battles of Saipan, Guam, and Tinian islands will have no impact on the overall war. Currently, the Japanese navy is actively waiting for an opportunity, aiming to destroy British and American forces. To prevent China from becoming a battlefield and to prevent China from falling into the tragic fate of Italy, preparations are being actively made at sea. The Japanese army's landing in Wenzhou and Fuzhou is also to assist the Japanese navy in protecting the Chinese mainland. Today, America is on the Pacific</p>
<h3>Naval Power</h3>
<p>According to American military experts, there are approximately ten standard aircraft carriers, thirty converted merchant ship aircraft carriers, possibly eight battleships in the front line, and four or five older battleships. There are approximately fifty submarines, thirty cruisers, and destroyers in operation. However, judging from the battles near Peleliu, its combat power has reached its maximum, and further increases are impossible. Moreover, today's naval battles, like past naval battles centered on a majority of battleships, must maintain</p>
<h3>Close Contact</h3>
<p>with mainland air bases to have a sure grasp of victory. Japan has indeed grasped this point in naval warfare, so the Japanese navy has long concentrated its forces, waiting for a suitable opportunity to destroy them in one fell swoop. Regarding the issue of American troops landing, they suffered significant losses during their attack on Saipan. Therefore, if they were to land in the Philippines, they would have to deploy a million troops. If they were to deploy a million American soldiers, they would first need to deploy 15 million tons of shipping capacity. If calculated at a speed of fourteen nautical miles per hour, it would take a month to transport them from Hawaii to the Philippines and back. Moreover, there are no good military ports to dock along the way, and there is a lack of better repair shipyards. Therefore, their transportation and supply problems are</p>
<h3>Extremely Difficult</h3>
<p>Conversely, Japan's supply lines are short, and mainland air bases are all under our control. Therefore, we deeply believe that the Pacific war situation, from whatever aspect one looks at it, is advantageous to us. However, there is one point that the people must pay attention to, which is that the Japanese navy is doing everything possible to prevent the American navy from landing in China, because they lack manpower and want to use Chinese manpower to fight and use Chinese land as a battlefield. After they land in China, the Chinese people will inevitably suffer even more. All the people of your country should deeply recognize this point and cooperate with us. For the sake of the happiness of the entire Greater East Asia nation, we also deeply believe that the people of your country can do their utmost to assist us.</p>

<h3>Central Agricultural Inspection Group Arrives in Shanghai from Nanjing Yesterday to Inspect Agricultural Production Increase in Shanghai and Zhejiang</h3>
<p>This year is designated as the year of increased production by the National Government.

<h3>Mission of This Trip</h3>
<p>According to Zhou's statement, [In order for the central government to understand the actual situation of agricultural production increase in various provinces and cities and to supervise and strengthen the effectiveness of agricultural production increase, the Ministries of Industry, Construction, and Social Welfare, the Executive Yuan's Agricultural Production Increase Promotion Committee, the Cooperative Enterprise Committee, and the New Life Movement Association jointly organized a production increase inspection group to inspect the regions of Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces in groups.

I sincerely hope that all sectors of Shanghai will provide in-depth guidance.]</p>
<h3>Inspection in Shanghai</h3>
<p>It is heard that the group is scheduled to first visit the municipal government and relevant agencies tomorrow, and then depart to inspect the counties in the four suburbs of Shanghai. The Municipal Agricultural Production Increase Promotion Committee, recognizing the importance of the group's mission, is preparing to welcome them and will send personnel to accompany them in inspecting the agriculture in the four suburbs.

I hope that all of you will pay close attention to various rural production increase undertakings during this trip, so as not to betray the good intentions of this inspection. Also yesterday (the 5th) morning, the three groups departed separately, the first group to Jiangning, the second group to Suzhou, and the third group to Shanghai, to conduct inspections according to the original itinerary.</p>

<p>Regarding the special rice allocation for teachers and staff in the city's primary and secondary schools, the Municipal Education Bureau issued orders to the school authorities last month to go for registration and stipulated that the end of last month was the deadline. Because there are still a few private schools that have not yet completed the procedures, the Education Bureau is now urging the principals of the schools to complete the procedures immediately, otherwise, they will not be tolerated and will be regarded as abandoning their rights, in order to consider the lives of teachers and staff of each school.</p>

<h3>Grand Occasion of Western Music Performance at the Chinese-Western Music Concert</h3>
<p>-- Hai Yan</p>
<p>Sitting quietly in the Lyceum Theatre for two hours, my whole body and mind were immersed in the atmosphere of music and singing. Time slowly slipped by, and the audience's hearts were filled with tension, excitement, and then with amazement and joy! The entire Western music performed this time includes two major parts: the performance of world-famous songs and the introduction of famous modern Chinese songs. It is divided into eight programs, with choirs accounting for three and soloists accounting for five. The large chorus program was sung by nearly a hundred top students from the National Conservatory of Music, which was truly a magnificent sight! However, although the number of people was large, it was not chaotic at all. The first two rows were occupied by female students, all in blue clothes, and the last two rows were occupied by male students, all in black suits, giving the audience the impression of being solemn and solemn. In addition, the harmony and unity of the singing can truly show the strict organization and well-trained nature of the conductor, Mr. Huang Yongxi. Mr. Ji Hanwen was the cello soloist. Mr. Ji is a musician in the Lih Zhi Social Symphony Orchestra and the Conservatory Orchestra. This time, the performance was wonderful and won a lot of applause. Mr. Ge Chaozhi performed the baritone solo. Mr. Ge is a proud student of the famous musician Zhao Meibo and the most reputable baritone singer in Shanghai. His vocal cords are wide and his singing is loud, powerful, and vigorous. After listening, people feel that [the reputation is well-deserved]. Miss Pan Meibo, known as the [Liszt Expert], performed a piano solo, playing two famous Liszt pieces. Her fingering was skilled, and her technique was her strength. When Miss Pan played, her posture was graceful, and her piano music was light, melodious, and melodious. After the two pieces were finished, there was thunderous applause. This time, she was a blockbuster, all thanks to her usual rigorous training and hard work, which was by no means accidental. Mr. Ma Sihong's violin is well-known in the music world and has been highly praised. He soloed his brother Si Ting's masterpieces, "Nostalgia" and "Dance Beyond the Great Wall," which was light, smooth, and perfect. After he left, the audience enthusiastically requested a encore. Amidst the applause, there were shouts of "Encore." Finally, under the warm welcome of [a thousand calls and ten thousand welcomes], Mr. Ma came out and played another piece to thank the audience. Mr. Huang Yuanyin was the tenor soloist. The four songs [Thunder Peak Pagoda], [Accidentally], [How Can I Not Think of Him], and [Remembering My Hometown] were sung with a sweet and emotional tone. His singing was emotional and expressive, and his pronunciation was extremely clear and correct. He is truly a rare tenor singer in Shanghai. The final chorus was still conducted by Huang Yongxi. The first song, [Sea Rhyme], is a song full of poetry and painting. The beautiful melody and poignant lyrics are truly a famous song among modern Chinese chorus songs that you will never tire of hearing! The final song, [Youth March], was chosen to be majestic and magnificent. This is very meaningful. The powerful singing and powerful words touched the heartstrings of every listener and made people's blood boil and dance. The [Chinese-Western Music Concert] sponsored by the Lianhua Bank and Shen Xin Newspapers to promote the moving learning campaign is on its last day today! Those who have heard the Chinese music performance are encouraged to come and listen to Western music so that music lovers can make a comparative study. Those who have not heard Chinese and Western music are even more eager to come and get to know and appreciate the greatness and moving power of music. Listening to noble music can help loan learning and charity, which is a win-win situation. Why not do it?</p>
<h3>Conversation with Mr. Wang Kemin for One Hour</h3>
<p>-- Wu Gong</p>
<p>Beijing on September 25th was full of autumn. On that afternoon, the reporter paid a visit to Mr. Wang Kemin, Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Commission. The reporter arrived at the former Foreign Ministry building at 3:30 p.m. This is where the North China Political Affairs Commission is now located. The building here is very magnificent. It was originally the place to entertain foreign treasures during the Beijing government era, so when the reporter stepped into the chairman's reception room, he was deeply impressed by the internal decoration, which gave him the impression of a European palace. Not long after the reception room, I heard the sound of footsteps coming at a leisurely pace, and the profile of a seasoned politician with a spirited spirit appeared before my eyes. [We haven't seen each other for more than a year,] a Mandarin voice with a Cantonese accent came from the mouth of this seasoned politician. At the time, I was thinking to myself that this leading figure in our country must have a very strong memory, even though the loss of one of his eyes forced him to wear black glasses all year round. [Because I wanted to see the economic situation in North China, I really hope to know some of the real situation here.]</p>
<h3>Problems with Controlled Economy</h3>
<p>[Speaking of the economy,] Wang said, gritting his teeth, [There's really nothing to talk about today, but it's always good to remove some man-made obstacles. Here, I'm not opposed to the controlled economy, but in economically backward China, where the countryside is isolated from the cities and the population cannot be accurately surveyed, so-called control must be considered in light of local conditions. Otherwise, if we insist on implementing the same kind of control as in advanced countries, there is a real danger of going against the original intention of control.] [Starting this summer,] I continued, [Central China has first eased the food control, but the result has not been able to bring the rice price back down.] [The so-called easing of control cannot be limited to food,] Wang thought for a while and said, [I think that there is no need for artificial control over things other than rice and grain, and the adjustment of rice prices depends on the so-called social granaries and Pingluo systems in ancient times in our country.] [Now, the food problem in the north seems to be a little better than before, right?] I asked. [Yes,] he said, striking a match to light a cigar, [The story of the mixed powder distribution here a year ago is now a thing of the past.] [Then,] I asked, following up, [What is the situation in the countryside here?]</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Situation in the Countryside</h3>
<p>[It is true, as the outside world says,] Wang replied, [It is inevitable that there are traces of the Eighth Route Army in the countryside, but the general public only knows that whoever truly loves the people and does not disturb the people can cooperate with them.] [Has the treatment of civil servants here recently improved somewhat?] The reporter changed the subject again. [Yes,] Wang immediately said, [There have been two improvements, last December and this April, and now we are discussing another increase in subsidies. Last year's official salaries reached 20 million yuan, and after this April, it increased to more than 30 million yuan. Recently, we have formulated two plans: one plan stipulates 100 million yuan, and the other stipulates more than 60 million yuan.] [Are you talking about increasing official salaries?] I asked again. [Not official salaries,] he told me clearly, [The salaries of civil and military officials here are still handled in accordance with the regulations stipulated before the incident, and what is now increasing refers to living subsidies, because the latter can be increased from time to time.] [Chairman, are you also concerned about the overall peace of our country?] Seeing that he was very talkative, I raised a new topic. [Of course, it is good to have peace,] he said, [But now this has obviously gone beyond the affairs of China and Japan!] [You must have seen General Ugaki when he came to China this time,] I asked again. [Yes,] he replied, [But we didn't talk about anything specific, just came to China for a visit!] [However, the recent decline in the international status of the Chongqing side is undeniable,] Wang said eloquently without any fatigue, [Even the United States has recently launched an unrestrained public opinion attack on Chongqing, but the government is still pretending to be deaf.] [Of course,] I said, [This time, the Japanese army's offensive on the mainland was a heavy blow to the Chongqing side.] [However,] he continued, [This heavy blow is not as severe as the impact they have suffered on their international status.] [Then,] I asked, [Isn't the future of our country very depressed in this kind of international evolution?] [There is no absolute hope for the War of Resistance,] Wang said frankly, [Is it easy to make progress in peace? This is indeed a great depression. If we do not assist the Allied forces in completing the final victory of the decisive battle, the future will be even more difficult to imagine.] [Yes,] I said, [At the decisive battle literary conference yesterday, Director Takeda of the Press Department also said: If we fail, the Soviet army will inevitably come to Manchuria to seek development. This is a real danger, right!] [I heard that Chairman Wang's condition has improved somewhat,] I finally switched to another topic.</p>
<h3>Concern for the Chairman's Condition</h3>
<p>[Yes,] he said, [We here will also send people to visit him. When the chairman sees him, he will shake his hand tightly and ask cordially about the political situation in North China. The chairman's tone is very clear, and we all hope that he will return to the country soon in good health to personally handle political affairs.] [When we held the propaganda conference on November 20th last year, Chairman Wang came in person to address us,] I said with a sentimental tone, [We never expected that after January, he would not be able to meet us again in the short term!] [This is really a sense of the past and present,] Wang also sighed sadly. [I and the chairman saw each other every day when we were young, but later we became estranged due to different political paths.] [Was the chairman also in Guangdong at that time?] I asked. [I grew up in Guangdong,] he said, [At that time, the chairman was probably nine years old, and I was sixteen. He was studying at his brother Boxin's place, and I was studying at Mr. Zhao's place. We met every day on the road!] [How old is the chairman?] I asked. [I'm sixty-nine years old!] he said with a smile. [You are still so strong,] I also said with a smile, [It seems that you are more radiant than when we met more than a year ago.] [There is no certainty about personnel matters,] Wang seemed a little pessimistic at first, [Didn't you see Chairman Wang in November last year? At that time, how could you have expected the changes after January?] At this point, I deeply felt that the time had passed too long, so I talked about some unimportant things and bid farewell to Wang.</p>
