<p>社評</p>
<h3>配給增加</h3>
<p>擁確責消息，盟邦在滬當局對於本市民生問題，非常關切，尤以最近米與煤球，黑市跳羅，市民生活感受嚴重　脅，密切注意，並决定協力中國主管當局，以切實有效方法，澈底調整從米與煤球增加配給數量開始，逐漸擴展至足够需要　並推及別種生活必需品。這消息絕不是從這聽塗說得來的，好在不久即有事實證明，所以，我們希望市民大衆以及關係商人注意幾點，同時，盼望有關當局竭力整飭，這是改普民生，與民更始的一個絕好的轉振點。</p>
<p>第一，希望市民對於黑市米煤，不必爭相購買，大量儲備。因為配給數量增加以後。黑市也必回低，那末，後日的便宜尙未見到，而不久的吃虧却先挨着，這種為了便宜友吃虧的打算，必為大家所不願做的。况且，大家爭購黑市，黑市就愈益居奇抬高，吃虧也就愈大。我們需要鎭靜的要求當局從配給方面改善，纔是根本目的，纔能改善生活。</p>
<p>第二，希望主管配給當局，嚴密監督經辦配給事務的機構，愼防作弊，革新方法。醫如經辦配給米的米店，有無攙雜短斤情事，一經發現作弊，立即撤銷其營業權利。同時，市民應竭力協助當局整頓舞弊，隨時依實檢舉，使中間剝削者知所炯戒，亦所以維繫人心道德。</p>
<p>第三，希望米統會全面革新，從機構組織，人事廉潔以至於辦事敏捷。我們會一再主張過，米統會的職掌是包括採辦儲運與配給三項，就應該負起這三大使命，雖運輸方面不能兼顧，而採辦與配給，必須有充分職權。將來如將配給事務合併於米統會時，則米統會即有採辦與配給兩項購權。該會當局應即注意全面革新，準備負起重大責任。</p>
<p>第四，希望主辦煤球配給機構，以及經辦配給煤球商人，同樣的整飭，為市民大衆服務，我們聽到的關於一部分煤球商作弊情形，尤共是最近一個時期，也是深惡痛絕，因為煤球問題在過去總算有長時期的平靜，並未施行戶口配給，大家的注意力就未如糧食問題的集中，現在實施配給，數百萬人視綫集中，自然不能任令作弊了。</p>
<p>最後，我們相信當局對於反映民意的與論，很有誠意加以考慮的。尤其是盟邦當局協力促成民生問題的調整改善，是値得欣幸的事。我們在十三日社評中主張消滅黑市，捨配給足量以外，任何嚴厲方法必無成效。配給足量是本，嚴禁黑市是末，捨本逐末，自非得計，今當局決定從增如米煤配給入手，自是治本之道。因此，我們希望市民對於配給上見到的弊實，以及一切改善民生的意見，切切實實的記出，加具眞實姓名，表示負責·在民意機關未經正式成立以前，我們顧以民間輿論的地位，代為轉請中日當局參考和採納，使政府與人民從此而益趨接近，做到打成一片的地步。</p>

<h3>列寗格勒前綫　戰事轉熾烈　南路各處亦在激戰</h3>
<p>柏林十六日中央社電海通社訊：星期六午接到東錢戰訊，過去二十四小時內，東錢北路敵軍開始向伊爾門湖以北及列寗格勒前綫進攻，伊爾門以北，係向諾夫高洛方面進攻，列寗格勒則在奧蘭運包姆區發動，預料即　延至其他區域，但敵軍尙無大軍參戰，除若干點被突破外，餘均加以擊退。</p>
<p>柏林十六日中央社電海通社軍事特派員塞托留斯稱：東綫北路自去夏沉寂迄今，突於星期五又有堅强敵軍猛攻多次，卒未能突人德軍陣綫。維持勃斯克區機軍亦於週五再度來犯，僅突入一小部份，但迅即被堵截。華獎特薩之西，德軍反攻，擊退蘇軍之先鋒，在蘇波舊界附近，　　　·諸伏格勒，伏林斯克一錢，敵軍無甚進展。貝迪契夫區德軍加緊壓迫敵軍，週四德軍會　滅突入後方之坦克車一隊，週五又殲滅敵軍兩聯隊。波格里希斯西南及夏許柯失之束及其南，德反攻續有進展，基洛伏格勒之西，德反攻順利，尼柯波爾橋頭堡敵　動不果，寇爾許東北，敵進攻亦無結果。</p>

<h3>倫敦落下　神秘炸彈　傅德使用無音飛機</h3>
<p>柏林十六日中央社訊海通社訊，路透社曾謂，星期五之夜，有炸彈兩枚洛於倫敦，惟當時並未注意，有敵機飛臨云云。德軍界方面對此說尙無表示，記者詢以此等神秘之業機是否德國新式之「閃營轟炸機」·軍事發言人　聳肩而已。</p>

<p>顧南羣　張一鵬　陳彬龢　同啓一月十七日</p>
<h3>第二戰綫的特徵　德國方面的觀測</h3>
<p>英美軍究將在幾時展開其所呼號的西歐第二戰綫呢？現在所知道的，均屬於臆測，不能說是正確的情報。但我們姑撇開時間問題不談，在進攻大陸戰中，觀測他們將採用何種戰術，或許不是無意義的事。</p>
<p>英美的戰術</p>
<p>不用說，英美軍戰術的特徵，是從「物量的優勢」這戰略的基礎上產生的。那戰術的實行者，就是前英第八軍司令官，最近被任為侵歐反軸心軍總司令官埃森霍華指揮下的英軍總司令官蒙高茂萊。現任印度總督的敗將華維爾，是步兵第一論者，蒙高茂萊則是機械化者的代表者，這眞是有興味的對照。華維爾的戰塲訓是「勇氣與决斷」，而蒙高茂萊則以「愼重」為第一標語。那就是說，前者主張英美軍應直接從北非攻克利特島及義大利本土，後者則主張北非戰事吿終後先占領班泰雷利亞島，在西西里島登陸。</p>
<p>蒙高茂萊主張祇在友方的空軍，尤其是戰關機的行動半徑以內，實施作戰。因這戰術，英美的戰蘭行動，被地理條件限制，遲遲不進。這作戰的遲滯，政治的考慮姑作別論，但可成為純軍事問題上的研究對象。我們硏究歡洲戰爭進展後的情形，可知英美軍忠實地遵守這蒙高茂萊的原則，逐漸建立反攻默洲的據點。第一是在英國本土與歐陸距離最近的英法海峽，第二是在歐洲大陸的南方側面，反軸心軍已經設定了幾個攻擊據點。那就是窺伺法國南部的科西嘉和用以進攻義國北部及南國的義國南部。第三是在成為問題的土耳其，在地理上，從這裏直衝巴爾幹是可能的。這此地方，都已經成為反軸心軍進攻德國內外兩廓防禦綫的基地。蒙特茂萊的戰術，必須鉅額的軍需資材，要設定這許多基地，不能不分散資材，恐怕反軸心軍的企圖同時進攻歐洲，比建立這許多基地更急吧！</p>
<p>集中主力西部</p>
<p>當然，我們可以想像，英美軍的主力，始終集合於西部，而在巴爾幹方面設第二陣地，以分散德軍的預備兵力。英國的報紙最近都在估計德軍在戰略上的預備軍之實數，這德軍在戰略上的預備·與空軍同為决定能否展開第二戰綫的分歧點。</p>
<p>中立國方面的觀察，侵人軍與防衛軍的兵力·雙方均在逐漸增加兵力·所成為問題者，是「幾時？」關於此，還有別的要素，那就是與紅軍的冬季攻勢作戰之調整問題。紅軍的冬季作戰，向例一人三月的泥濘期就成膠着狀態，因此，其時期無論如何須在芷月或二月。另一英國某有力報紙稱。</p>
<p>「這二個月，專事强化對歐洲大陸的「空中攻勢」，企圖從空中攪亂德軍的運輸組織。」</p>
<p>此報的論調，依然祗賴空軍。所以隨着春的降臨，歐洲侵攻問題也遂漸帶來了現實性。沮利希某報報道柏林當局的見解說：預料「一月二月有侵攻的可能性」，這是現在最可注目的。因為這二個月間，政治的要素，與蘇聯的攻勢相呼應，演出主要任務的可能性頗多的緣故。（翔：譚自一月五日西部朝日新聞）</p>
<h3>市宣傅處召開　七次記者例會</h3>
<p>中央社訊市宣傳處於前日（一月十五日）下午二時，在市府二樓會議室召開第七次記者例會，計到各報社各通訊社記者，各機關代表三十餘人，由宜傳處梁處長（潘秘書代）主持，茲將各報記者提出問題，及各機關代表解答，分誌如下：</p>
<p>棉布配給問題</p>
<p>國民新聞社問：棉布配給，前次經濟局說明本年二月間可實行，現市面零售布商，實際已開始出售，每人憑市民證得購一丈五尺，此種售布是否從前所謂保留額，與將來眞正實施配給用戶之棉布尙有差別，尤以目前市民撓證，前往購置時，布商均以每尺價四五十元花色布應市，欲求限價，藍白布咸稱售罄，市民仍無法獲到需要布料，當局對此售布方式是否當需改進，或另謀更妥善辦法？</p>
<p>經濟回答：棉布配給基準方案，商統會棉業管理處正在積極研究中，俟方案决定後，當可實施配給。現在每人憑市民證得向零售商購買一丈五尺之布，係指保留之半數而言，與將來正式配給之棉布，根本不同。至於零售商號如有抬價或其他不法行為，一經察覺，必予嚴處。</p>
<p>各區配給問題</p>
<p>平報社問：本市配給物品之實施，總以一八兩區佔先，如火柴肥皂之配給，一八兩區已實施兩次，其他各區迄今未見實行，究竟今後配給物資，各區能否一律，敢請詳為釋示，以砝羣疑？</p>
<p>經濟局答：本市配給物品之實施，自一入兩區實行後，本局亦即積極籌備，現已决定本男二十日開始配給火柴·肥皂·煤球·三種，至於四郊各區因物資搬出基準數量關關係，巳提出物資統制審議會，一俟審核决定，亦當實施</p>
<p>繳送廢鐵問題</p>
<p>平報社問：傳七區方面住戶曾接通吿，每家須獻廢鐵二斤，並有限於一月十日繳送，如不貢獻，即將停配戶口米之說，此項命令獻鐵，是否有强制性質，如無廢鐵繳送，是否將停止米糧之配給，應請將關於此一問題之原委詳示，俾刋諸報端，藉便週知。</p>
<p>市保甲委員會：本會與第二警察局徵集廢金屬問題，純出居民自由輸捐，並無量數規定，不涉及戶口米糧之配給，各區居民獻鐵運動，有鐵繳納者，無掣付收據之手續，無鐵繳納者，不作任何之記載，即此可知一般保甲長愛國心熱，間或以激勸鼓勵語氣，督促居民，踴躍輸將，亦係志在容易收集，早完獻鐵使命，熱心報國，未可厚非也。</p>

<h3>復刋第十八號無人島漂流六日記</h3>
<p>為了擊潰敵寇，我們飛行員的驚天地泣鬼神之英勇作戰精神，無論在冰天雪地的北方，或是汗流浹背的南方，都曾痛快淋漓地發揮盡致，然而在這樣可歌可泣的殺敵戰果裹，在這樣出類拔萃的巧妙作戰裏，隱蔽着無數難於想像的壯烈犧牲，以及崇高的沉着精神力。〇〇部隊長隨帶十一名部下的奇續般的生還，這不僅是隊伍中的奇談，而且也如實地表現着飛行員的戰鬥本能。</p>
<p>在戰雲密佈的〇〇方面，敵寇取得先發制人的反攻，而展開了〇〇地的作戰。就在這個時機，遇着重要使命的〇〇部隊長，率領着部下，駕駛着飛機，竟自向次一個飛機基地前進。飛機起飛後，一直向目的地前進，經過〇小時，不知為什麼右面發動機突然停止了。駕駛員曾是平安駕駛過十五年的〇〇中尉。以最大的沉着心，而努力從事修理工作，然而就在這個期，左方的發動機也突然停止了。這時是在〇千公尺的天空中，下面就是風濤大作的海洋，中尉雖然費盡了九平二虎之力，但這是毫不容一刹那的猶預和躊躇。距離〇〇羣島尙遙遠之至，然而這時業已無能為力了。除了降落到水面上，是別無他法的。可是中尉，仍然拚命地東轉西繞發動機，正在這個當兒，在天空上發見了兩個無人島。但飛機慢慢地降低高度，終於被迫落在海面上了。部下在這個時候，只關懷着部隊長，把早已準備一就緒的浮　舟，放在水面上，再把重要文件及軍刀裝運上，然後又讓部隊長坐上，於是大家一同替部隊長祈禱祝福。</p>
<p>最後，飛機終於降落一到水面上，但一刹那間，一竟沉入海底了。大家都追隨着部隊長，急速開始避難。一切的一切，完全都是瞬息間的事，的確是說時遲，那時快，而大家保護着部隊長所坐着的浮囊，便開始向遙遠渺茫的無人島前游。雖然距離無人島只有六公里，但其附近帶，都有進退甚急的潮流和浪濤，致使靠岸非常不容易，弄得筋疲力竭，經過三小時的艱苦奮鬥，而費了九牛二虎之力，方都無法躺一下。大家雖然都高興得救了，但都在非常關心，怎樣可以把部隊長救回去。某上尉把過於疲勞的身體振奮一下，便開始尋找入海島的地方了。在南海的孤島上，將至黃昏時節、上尉在水邊上發現了一處狹窄的砂灘。所有的東西，只是身邊二瓶汽水和一粒椰子殼，此外便是葱鬱的樹林和海島了。在砂灘上一徘徊，脚便陷入一個洞穴裏，一挖掘，就發現裘邊埋着死人骨髏。上對便又靜靜地把白骨埋好，即把所有的人員都呌到砂灘上來，於是大家坐以待且渡過這個蒙難的第一夜。</p>
<p>第一夜</p>
<p>在砂攤上集攏着的大家，被飢寒與疲勞所交迫着，於是大家便决定烈火取暖，但在游泳期間，上身的衣裳與鞋襪都被水冲去，點火物Ligliter只有兩個，把乾柴拾來，但是很不容易着火。頭一個點火物沒有發生效力，最後一個，好反夢是把火點起來了。於是大家都覺得溫暖起來，寒氣被打退了。然而却找不到食物和水。起初雖然不管三七二十一，跑到海濱去喝海水，但是愈喝愈喝。從夜光里隱約所照耀的樹林裏拾撮乾枝來生火，然而從樹林裏爬出無數蛇蜴，都向疲倦的我們身邊集合，從砂堆中鑽出許多從未見過和從未聽過的毒虫來，刺和螫得我們，無法入夢。而由樹林裏不斷傳來，不知名的怪鳥聲音，响徹雲霄，眞覺得悽凉萬分！在深更時分，因有經不起疲倦而入睡者，但因為怕洪水猛獸突然來養，所以就沒了崗。就是這樣過了一夜。</p>
<p>第二日</p>
<p>天色未亮，就急忙起來去找食物者有之。但該處旣無椰子，又無香蕉，又加上無水可喝，眞够得上一塊窮地。立刻我們分成搜索班和設營班。搜索班就立刻就職履新，開始搜索水和食物，然而結果只是把樹林中酸澀不能食的樹子拾來，仍然還是不能用。後來便想到在砂石中捉蛤蜊，或捕蝦蟹，但因疲憊的身體，動轉不靈，只是望影興嘆而巳！</p>
<p>整整的一晝夜，沒有吃沒有喝，到了下午越過森林後，就發見了水。是岩石的陰面所債存的雨水，發見者情不自禁地就不管三七二十一地唱了　頓，然而仔細一看，原來裏面有無數孑　在上下翻着觔斗。另外的人，便少微濾淸一下就暍了，由於這些水的味道好，大家竟都忘記所以。到了黃昏時節，有的人打算在森地中捕捉鳥獸，但終於一無所獲。雖然曾看見約有兩公尺長的大竭蜥和伊索寓言中所謂的怪烏，但只好望而興歡。魚也是看見好多，要想捉到手，眞是談何容易。於是這一長又白白地過去了。飛機在非常高的空中飛翔，但我們看來，只好像在遙遠的水平錢上的一葉扁舟，在我們的祗終裏一幌，就消逝於無形了。我們只是長吁短歎，望着天水一色的世界，呆呆地凝視。在極度的飢餓與渡勞裏，又來迎接夜神的降臨。</p>
<p>第三日</p>
<p>整個上午，也像昨天一樣，授尋食物了·結果只得到一些樹葉和海水，甚至岩石陰面的續水也沒有了，所以下午就决定脫離這個留之無用素之可惜的孤島。在其北方三百公尺地方，有一個大島。兩島之間，有險急的浪潮在動蕩不定着。同時還有四公尺多長的大鯊魚羣，在虎視耽耽地來往游着。是再沒有比這更危險的潮流了。設營班備嘗辛苦所營造的不筏，坐上三個人，不幸而沉入海底，眞是白費了無數心血。大家都在萬分失望之際，而終於發見了流失的那個浮囊舟，下午便開始向彼岸移動。雖然從這一島到那一島，只有三　公尺，但這個移動却是然費苦心的大事。是要運賴以活命的「火種」過去的。幾乎費了一小時，好容易平安渡過。這個周回六公里的孤島，仍然還意沒有食物，只是發見了平地湧出的淸水泉，這眞是一處謝天謝地的事。</p>
<p>第四日</p>
<p>從深夜二時左右至七時，曾有極凶的暴風島費盡九半二虎之力搬運過來的生命火種，大家都在夢中，而被捕滅了。但這樣常此以往的下去，只有坐以待斃。必須再接再厲，拼命脫出危險境地。設營班修理好浮囊舟後，將近中午的時候，〇〇中尉和〇〇曹長，便開始划行了。大家交喝着水杯，作痛苦苦的離別。這以前，雖然約地曾看見過兩次飛機，和兩三次打魚船，但眨眼間就消逝了，這只有給我們一些失望的因素。留在島上的人們，對於這兩位冒險家，寄與無限的期待，都在獸獸中祈禱其一帆風順，馬到成功。</p>
<p>第五日</p>
<p>飢餓，在生理上是難於忍受的，年靑者，想講一些山珍海味的膳食，以上飢，於是便把食譜在腦海中翻出來，品洋大魚麵，肉絲麵等的食物，然而愈講反來愈餓。</p>
<p>部下想要上司不必關心自己，然而部隊長對部下懷念的心緒却愈益堅固，總是像自已的事情一樣來看待。尤其古來的武士故事，如石田三成，常被判决罪刑的前一天，因部下平常過於愛戴三成，所以就獻柿子給三成吃，然而三成說杮子中有毒，對於自己的社皮是不合適的，就這樣謝絕了他的部下，這種感激，終成為現代人的一個善談·担受祖國重任的武人，把自己的事情傳留給部下，希望在最後一個人中能完成任務。還有，有的部下接受部隊長的命令，到森林去調查。當他　利完成任務，回來報吿長官時，總像平常那樣嚴肅的報吿一樣，說「無變化」，然而疲憊不堪的地，報吿完畢，逃開長官的視綫後，就暈倒了·這種部下不願把自己的倦態，讓長官看見的這一軍人精神，就使大家熱淚橫流。</p>
<p>第六日</p>
<p>去進行連絡在務的〇〇中對，在出發的那一天夜裏，就遇見了南洋特有的那種狂風暴雨，但拼命地支掌着福囊，而在海洋上一直地向東進發。而在第六天頭上，經過了筆墨難以形容的絕大困難役，才喜出望外地碰到了當地士著的捕魚船。信賴皇軍的土著，就給疲勞過度的中對們吃飯和暍水。然而兩個人並不先吃，立刻就去和友軍連絡。然而他們的目的地，是距離該地有一盡夜的路程，兩個人就劃駛着浮囊舟。按照漁夫的話，一直向南下去了。然後劃駛了四小時，上天終於有眼，派來救星了。這一天，特別在這一帶航行中的〇〇部隊運輸船，就發見了這兩位勇士。運輸船聽到了兩位勇士的話，立刻就向蒙難島急速前進。太陽將落的時候，在無人島岬上的一位曹長，突然高聲吶喊：「船，船來了：」〇〇上尉爬到岬上一看，的確像是一隻船，且好像是逐漸迫近。十分看淸楚後的上尉，就去報告部隊長。船原來不是別的，就是一艘運輸船·距離島岸五百公尺的地方　泊下，吐著白烟，小汽艇的汽笛就響了，出於大家的努力幫助，部隊長及所有的人就得救了。在遇難後的第七號頭上，就回到〇〇基地了，（大魯譯自十二月二十八日每日新聞）</p>

<h3>伊拉瓦底河的渡船</h3>
<p>我們所屬目的阿拉實山，在河的對面，遙遠的彼方。從仰光出發的汽車，到伊拉瓦底河是終點·從此地出發，除了渡船和卡車外，沒有別的。</p>
<p>雨季的伊拉瓦底河，眞所謂濁流滔滔，水流五六米，要橫渡這濁流，那船的苦勞可想而知。到對岸計一五〇〇米，碧綠的丘陵綿延着，汽船拖曳的船結連起來的軍隊的渡河船，描成一道大的弧綫，橫宣在棧橋上。似乎絡繹歸來的一團兵士，和馬及汽車從船上起岸，岸邊等待着的一羣便交替着上船。不知道敵機什麼時候要來，都隨時很緊張地，誰也不說一句話。（柏原覺太郞畫）（根據朝日新聞製）</p>

<h3>寂寞的故事（二）</h3>
<p>— 虹影</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>猛的一聲口哨，將我從沈思中驚醒，我奇怪，我納悶、我不知道現在要跟着發中什麽不幸，接着我更聽見了踏踏的馬蹄聲，和嘈雜的私語聲，我簡直抖動了，我知道這是强盜的來臨。</p>
<p>果然，進來了，是十幾個滿臉積肉的人，就只看見那樣粗壯的身軀，也已經够使人害怕了。</p>
<p>在二十歲的時候，不是吿訴你了嗎？我本是年富力强的一個，我的主人也時常在他的客人面前，誇讀我身體强壯的事情，可是比起他們來，我瘦小得是冬麼的可憐呵！</p>
<p>他們站在我的面前，那個身體最長的一個，翻轉了眼睛，為我說：</p>
<p>「喂！識相一點，拿出所有的東西來！」</p>
<p>「大王，大王，我是個送公文的，我沒有什麽東西！」我嚇得連看也不敢看他一下。「胡說，快點拿出來，否則看這是什麼？」說着說着他抽出一把亮晶晶的刀，我低着頭，拿出了我的公文，也拿出了我身邊所有的錢。</p>
<p>「大王，東西都在這的？」</p>
<p>「放屁，東西總在這裏了嗎？好的，公文不要你的，弟兄們，把錢拿起來，我們再到第二個房間去！」</p>
<p>他們走了，我總算放了心，雖然錢是丟了，可是公文還在這裏，總算不幸中的大幸，於是我關了房門。</p>
<p>可是，又來了，這回進來的是一偭人，是剛才把錢從桌上拿走的一個人，可是，因為是一個人，我也放心了不少。</p>
<p>「喂，把公文拿出來，快點！」「剛才，大王不是看過了嗎？」</p>
<p>「胡說，快點，拿出來！」</p>
<p>「可是，公文，我不能。」</p>
<p>「他媽的，你不拿嗎；」接着就是一棍子，對我的頭打下來。我用膀子迎了上去，結果，我被打倒在地上，我的膀子，好像斷了一樣的在痛。他拿了公文，他要放進他的懷內，可是，我又站起來了，我要將他奪回來，因為我又想起在早晨主人關照我要塡重的話。</p>
<p>我們打了起來，誰知他竟打不過我，沒有三下，巳被我打倒在地上。接着我又用雙手，對準了他的咽喉，猛壓下去，結果他死了，放了一個屁，嘴上也消了一點血。這滴血，慢慢的從他的嘴角上，流到我的手上，就這樣的我結東了一條生命。</p>
<p>他們要走了，我聽見他們嚷着說少了一個伙伴，我又聽見他們又走回來的脚步聲，我知道他們在找尋他了。</p>
<p>接着我聽見一個人的脚步聲，在向我的房內走米。這時，我焦急了，在焦急的心緒之下，我用力打破了木板做的窗士，我跳了出去。</p>
<p>我聽見在房內有人駡了一聲「他媽的」，我知道這個就是那個被我稱着大王的人。</p>
<p>可是，我不管了，我以知道背起了我的公文，跨上了銷在後院裏的馬，在呼呼的大風裏，在漆黑的一片裏，我又望前奔去，在後面我更聽見踏踏的馬蹄聲，和深深的歎惜聲這時、我忘記了怕，</p>
<p>也忘記了冷，我只管打着我的馬，在黑暗中望前奔。</p>
<p>到了天微明的時候，我到了我要到的地方，從此，我也辭去了這件差使，雖然，主人極端的挽留我。</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>在淡黃的光下，老王又打開了胸膛。雖然，外面是呼呼的大風。可是老王卻興奮的感到火一樣的在燒。</p>
<p>突然，「嘩啦」一聲，我以為又走進了十幾個身驅强大的人，可是，沒有，什麼也沒有，這不過是一匹很大的老鼠，打翻了一僩油瓶，接着他又才從我身邊跑過去。我總算放下了心，於是我駡了一聲「很惡的畜牲」，老王一笑了，並且拍拍我的肩膀，向我說：「小孩子，不要怕，這裏是不會有强盜的。」</p>
<p>說完了，他又繼續的吸她的烟去了，眼睛閉了起來，像是又在想著什麽的一樣。</p>
<p>屋外仍是怒吼的風，於是我又寂寞了起來，不過，在寂寞之中我更在記憶着一個寂寞的故事。</p>
<p>不久，淡黃色的燈，漸漸的暗了下去，這是沒有油的原故吧；然而我也懶得去看了。</p>
<p>不知在什麽時候，老王又裏起了他胸膛口的散開的衣服，而白鬍子呢，也漸漸的看不淸了。〔完〕</p>

<p>— 蕭夢</p>
<p>黃昏，誰家的兒郞在歌唱，醖釀在靜止汚濁的太空裏，是主的禮讃呢！「吉布賽」型流浪海涯的我，又難能不神往。</p>
<p>雖然我還年靑，但逝去了童年回憶的細　，是酸，是苦，抑或是……苦咖啡般的領略哪！徒的引起的是悵惘。面頰上的熊覺是　濕，是血啊？淚？</p>
<p>臨窗的角隅，從這輝黃的太空裏看出許多沒有闐息，浮雕的記錄，可是洗燙天涯的我，免不了激泛起心底漪滴，人家說母親的心像三春的和風，我底想像呵！却不那樣，心，母親一顆心，是冷酷，猙獰。世上又那有不愛見子的母親？問輝黃的天，我問。</p>
<p>伊的私奔，使我很早五歲起就脫離母枝的拂護，　，飄。飄在黑的色彩裏，乾燥的心一碰就染上了。飄在海裏，隨浪逐去了，是母親的罪？是現實的罪？</p>
<p>呵！是血啊？淚？濕透了面頰。這崎嶇的「生之旅程」。</p>
<p>臨窗的角隅，黃昏的將斷，更深的黑暗，我知，最先遭受到夜的蹂躪的是我，曙光的再現時，接受到愛底恩賜的也是我。</p>
<p>管牠是血啊？淚？黃昏啓示了我。</p>

<h3>國際杯足球賽即將舉行　中華陣綫支配的研究　擬定對葡萄牙義聯兩戰陣綫</h3>
<p>國際盃足球賽，即將開始。中華隊已攜選正式代表，並且有過兩次試賽。然而兩次試賽的成績，都未能有理想中的美妙。將來正式作戰，照目下情形而論，凶多吉少，這簡直可說是陳容支配的關係。本刋對於中華隊陣綫，曾有硏討。現筆者敢獻一得之見，俾資硏究。</p>
<p>我先想說的：便是這福楨右前衛吳祺祥，左前的支配，五鋒中一定有人次所選的代表，在技術上的，乃是「一口氣」的是否趕得上，我們許多時間在球塲上，看到一個球員明明可以趕過去得到傳來</p>
<p>其次我欲說的，便是球路，俗所謂「尅星」，我們可以想到的，在若干年前的報上有過一段說；「英國“Arsnel”隊是英國最上等的球隊，但是在聯賽中，却敗給一庸弱的隊伍，完全是「球路」的失敗」。這在上海也可以看到。中華隊屢遭葡萄牙的毒手，像賈幼良逢馬山兒，熟麟經碰考司坦，便所謂「剋星」，就會變去本來的面目。</p>
<p>最後，當然是觀察各球員近况，作一决定。茲擬貢獻兩個陣容。</p>
<p>對葡萄牙戰之陣綫</p>
<p>對葡萄牙之戰應該是這樣。守門劉顯漢，右內衛張林根，左內衛李寗，中堅譚衛宋靈　，前勢用東華之戴，韓，孫，賈，李五虎。我的理由很簡單。此陣容祗有李寗戴麟經，有趕不及一步的缺點，但是李寗能夠站立到最好的位置來　補。　　經的傅　是相當的好，而且五錄聯絡，巳有相當的契默。在東華本屆迭次的攻勢中可以看到。現在再有吳祺祥，宋靈聖能帶球的前衛，更將增加其不少攻勢的·至於中衛綫上為何不想到鄭英權和　永福，我肯電的說，因為近况不佳，鄭少細膩，瞿則拖泥帶水，這也許誰也不能否認的事實。右翼一職，要是馬山兒出塲，或許有人以為應該起用費春華，我以為這是絕對要不得。因為馬山兒已在每况愈下的情形下，而賈的近狀，是正常的進展中。目下滬上最理想的人物了，其盤馳之快，勾中之適當，年衰的馬山兒，無論如何，不能像過去的阻止得他。</p>
<p>對義聯隊戰之陣線</p>
<p>對義聯之戰應該是這樣。守門劉顯漢，右內衛張林根左內衛吳祺祥，中堅鐸福禎，右前衛鄭英權，左前衛宋靈聖，前鋒還是東華五將。這很顯明的守衛方面，對義聯應該用淸爽的脚頭來抵止。所以我這樣要疑問，最少可以把許文　　出戴麟經或　龍海。表以為不然。因為戴有一配供給右鋒急撥進德絕號傅進，以前有陳　　有時趕得上，如今韓　海亦已領會到，所以韓每　當能有紀錄。然而他的脚頭並不見得好，他每多試用這一記。</p>
<p>我的見解如上，匆匆的寫來，不週之處當然很多，但正希望各界予以參考而已。必須聲明的，絕非故弄　頭，幸閱者垂鑒！</p>

<p>上週西靑籃球，少强隊對抗，精彩不多，調五更以汕隊對蒙納克，當局臨時改期，而遭無數觀衆耍求退票。當時情形·其見擾雜。按本屆西靑主辦當局，確屬臺無管理。小焉者，如球票問題·遇右強隊比賽時·看客　難購得球票，非購黑市門票，不得其門而入，其次為坐位問題。按樓下照章分二十六元十三元兩種，二十六元者依號入座，然事實上，有十三元票者，儘可高坐二十六元內，而二十六元票者，祗能屆坐十三元座，無人干涉。又如記者座內，難有我人踪跡·忝立一隅，記述殊苦。此番汕隊蒙納克之改期，據汕隊幹事云：早於二日前要求照准，而當局不通知報館，據某記者謂曾於前一日與西靑通電話，亦未見其提及，其辦事之草率如此，以至當日各報照舊登載，造成吵鬧情形。幸劉荷生急中生智，以汕隊凑　仁餘隊員對蒙納克作友誼賽，觀衆乃吿無事。然記者深願西靑當局，得此次敎訓，嗣後在各方面力求改進，則幸矣，茲評上週戰事。</p>
<p>評述上週戰況</p>
<p>東方與汕隊之戰，東方是日僅到五將，且幸有樊慶咸助陣，否則祇有四人，難免敗績，汕隊此戰，甚為努力，一洗上週與同仁時之傲態，恢復以前有為之風格，全隊採五人聯防術，極甚緊凑，進攻時又有美妙迎絡，及利用其體力之勝人，　捷異常。東方採人釘人·然力有未足，樊　咸久疏於此，不免惶張，幸賴許文奎張少卿射籃有靈，得以吿捷一，誠倖哉！</p>
<p>華影自錢旭滄歸來後，軍心自振，與華南戰，固未曾無勝利希望。錄羅南三敗之後，漸見氣餒，兩隊均採用地位防　，此攻彼守，倐來倐去，極盡戰力，華南之勝，胡金桂在邊綫鑽中，躍起投籃。以及劉福善中路隻手推進，均多功成。華影投籃方面，少有把握，高茫生不能時來蓬來，輪贏之分，即在於斯。</p>
<p>同仁　餘相逢，前者年靑有爲，後者老氣橫秋。斯役，老將竟詎以半球之瑩得勝，則全侍乎陳祥龍隻手成功。　祥龍身　高大，同仁莫能有人阻得住其跟進，乃吿慘敗。同仁亦由五人聯　術而演進有時應用二人注意一人。祥能跟　時，必須二人看牢，同　不知利用，乃戰術失敗！而　俊球遲不通，　通多浪　，否則勝數球，易如反掌。</p>
<p>聯繫大敗大華，宛如以石擊卵，華聯繫尙未用正式陣容，主人張港祥亦戎裝出塲，不事多求。然究以實力之懸殊，勝者能攻能守，戰術多變化。敗者雖欲盡力禦防不可得也，結果分數相差太大。</p>
<p>仁餘三輪，乃補　隊蒙納克之賽，與　一戰相同，觀仁餘攻術，銳利非凡，其唯一缺點，爲射籃前鋒無人，反恃兩後衛之遠射，以故得分乃少，三輪精神頗好，氣力不足，後勁缺乏，在籃球賽中最大之缺　，不得不見屈。仁餘戰况，已在頂高峯狀能下，　求射籃之準確，乃　有作爲。</p>
<p>本週秩序大有可觀</p>
<p>本週秩序：週一華影對東方，三輪對巨人，首塲尙有可看。週三·同仁對仁餘，業餘對華南。首塲必有劇烈爭鬥。而週五有東方對華聯藥，及華影對蒙納克，勢可轟動一時，東方希望，在此一舉，華聯藥更不能輕易放過，東方官力·不逮華聯藥。而陸鐘恩能用腦筋，其對於華聯樂之個人優點劣處及全隊攻守路徑，洞見無　、將攻其短處，華聯棄須注意戰術上取勝，此服役之吸引力，必破紀錄。記者願在此戰中看到水準之提高，更切盼西靑及早注意秩序之維持問題。</p>

        <h1>1944 - n17</h1>
<h3>Increased Rationing</h3>
<p>According to reliable sources, Allied authorities in Shanghai are deeply concerned about the livelihood of the local citizens, particularly regarding the recent soaring black market prices of rice and coal briquettes, which severely threaten the citizens' well-being. They are closely monitoring the situation and have decided to collaborate with the responsible Chinese authorities to thoroughly adjust the supply system with practical and effective measures, starting with increasing the ration quantities of rice and coal briquettes, gradually expanding to meet sufficient needs, and extending to other essential commodities. This news is not merely hearsay, as it will soon be proven by facts. Therefore, we hope that the citizens and related merchants will pay attention to a few points. At the same time, we hope that the relevant authorities will do their utmost to rectify the situation, as this is an excellent turning point to improve the people's livelihood and start anew with the people.</p>
<p>Firstly, we hope that citizens will not rush to buy and hoard rice and coal briquettes from the black market. Because after the ration quantities increase, the black market prices will inevitably fall. The benefit of lower prices in the future has not yet been seen, but the loss of higher prices now will be incurred first. Such a plan of incurring losses for the sake of future benefits is something that everyone would be unwilling to do. Moreover, when everyone competes to buy from the black market, the black market will become even more opportunistic and raise prices, resulting in even greater losses. We need to calmly demand that the authorities improve the rationing system, as this is the fundamental goal and the only way to improve our lives.</p>
<p>Secondly, we hope that the authorities in charge of rationing will strictly supervise the organizations handling rationing affairs, carefully prevent fraud, and innovate methods. For example, in the case of rice shops handling the rationing of rice, whether there is any adulteration or short weighing. Once fraud is discovered, the business license should be revoked immediately. At the same time, citizens should do their utmost to assist the authorities in rectifying corruption, report truthfully at any time, so that the middlemen who exploit the situation will know to restrain themselves, which is also a way to maintain public morale and ethics.</p>
<p>Thirdly, we hope that the Rice Control Association will undergo a comprehensive reform, from organizational structure, personnel integrity to efficient handling of affairs. We have repeatedly argued that the responsibilities of the Rice Control Association include procurement, storage, transportation, and distribution. It should take on these three major missions. Although it cannot take care of the transportation aspect, it must have full authority over procurement and distribution. In the future, if the distribution affairs are merged into the Rice Control Association, then the Rice Control Association will have the authority to both procure and distribute. The authorities of the association should immediately pay attention to comprehensive reform and prepare to take on major responsibilities.</p>
<p>Fourthly, we hope that the organizations in charge of coal briquette rationing, as well as the merchants handling the rationing of coal briquettes, will be similarly rectified to serve the public. We have heard about the fraudulent practices of some coal briquette merchants, especially in recent times, which is also deeply abhorrent. Because the coal briquette problem has generally been calm for a long period of time, and household rationing has not been implemented, everyone's attention has not been as focused as on the food problem. Now that rationing is implemented, the eyes of millions of people are focused, so fraud cannot be allowed.</p>
<p>Finally, we believe that the authorities are sincere in considering public opinion that reflects the people's will. It is especially gratifying that the Allied authorities are helping to promote the adjustment and improvement of the people's livelihood. In our editorial on the 13th, we advocated eliminating the black market. Apart from sufficient rationing, any strict measures will be ineffective. Sufficient rationing is the root, and strictly prohibiting the black market is the branch. Abandoning the root and pursuing the branch is certainly not a good plan. Now that the authorities have decided to start by increasing the ration of rice and coal, this is naturally the way to address the root cause. Therefore, we hope that citizens will carefully record the malpractices seen in rationing, as well as all opinions on improving the people's livelihood, and provide their real names to indicate responsibility. Before the formal establishment of people's representative bodies, we, in our position as public opinion of the people, will forward them to the Chinese and Japanese authorities for reference and adoption, so that the government and the people will become closer from now on, and achieve a harmonious relationship.</p>
<h3>Urging Chiang in Chongqing to Reflect, Broadcast by Persia in Japan</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - The Supreme Advisor of the Provisional Government of India, Biharis, broadcast to Chiang in Chongqing at 4:00 PM today from the Central Broadcasting Station here, urging him to reflect so that the overall peace of China can be realized as soon as possible. The gist is as follows:</p>
<p>I had a close relationship with your country's founding father, Mr. Sun Yat-sen, during the difficult times of nation-building in your country. We discussed the issue of Indian independence. Mr. Sun devoted his life to realizing Pan-Asianism and worked hard for it. Now, Your Excellency is violating Mr. Sun's ideals and engaging in internecine warfare, which is truly distressing. Today, only Your Excellency has not yet joined the war to liberate East Asia and is willing to maintain the Anglo-Saxon oppression of Asia, sacrificing the Chinese people. This is truly a tragic event. The independence of our two countries is closely related, so I care about the independence of your country as much as I care about the enemy's country. After the British oppressed India into submission, they turned their attention to your country in the 19th century. They invaded your country with opium produced in India and their military force, leading to the Opium War, which was the beginning of many unequal treaties in China. Now, there are a few things I would like to ask Your Excellency: For what exactly are you fighting? Why are you supporting the British and Americans in suppressing China, plundering Chinese resources, and enslaving the Chinese people, making Asia their dependency? What is the purpose of the British and Americans in fighting the war? It is extremely clear that their victory is unfavorable to China and India, and means the demise of Asian nations. Now, Your Excellency is even fighting against the Indian people for the British. This is truly a great insult to the Indian people. India has been invaded and plundered by Britain and has been plunged into the abyss of starvation and destruction for the past two centuries. Yet, Your Excellency is asking to work with the British to oppose the Indian people. Your Excellency is asking the Indian people to cooperate with Britain and is also asking Britain to recapture Burma and reopen the Burma Road. Your Excellency is truly not thinking of the Burmese people. To aid the British army, Your Excellency sent troops to Burma. The Burmese people, who are neither friendly nor fierce, will eventually drive out the British army with the support of Japan. The newly emerging nations of free Asia will shatter the illegal attempts of the Anglo-Saxons with firm and unwavering determination. The late Mr. Sun Yat-sen once said in a speech in Kobe on November 28, 1924, that if Asian nations could unite and build a common front to oppose the Westerners, they would achieve final victory. Today, the newly emerging nations of Asia, which have secured their positions, will shatter the Anglo-Saxon attempts with a determination to sever their heads. Mr. Sun's prediction has already been realized step by step. Therefore, it is Your Excellency's duty to cooperate with the Asian nations to strive for final victory. I would like to advise Your Excellency with this.</p>

<h3>Satisfactory Results of the National Economic Conference, Statements by Zou Jingfang and Others</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency) - The plenary session of the National Economic Conference was successfully held in Nanjing on the 15th. Yesterday, the Central News Agency reporters specially visited the Secretary-General of the Conference, Zou Jingfang, and others, to inquire about their impressions of attending the conference. They were kind enough to make statements, which are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Zou Jingfang said: "On New Year's Day this year, the Chairman instructed us that the work policy for the future is 'Rectifying Thoughts,' 'Ensuring Security,' and 'Increasing Production.' This convocation of the Third Plenary Session of the National Economic Conference is to meet the needs of the current environment. Therefore, the focus of the conference is on increasing production. There are a total of three proposals focused on increasing production, including agricultural and industrial production. Our country is an agricultural country. This time, there is a resolution to adjust the outline of rural finance, to absorb rural crops and distribute them reasonably, based on the principle of exchanging crops and other items. In the past, we have established many experimental areas and demonstration fields in various places to increase agricultural production. In the future, we will seek their development, and at the same time, we plan to establish state-owned farms and promote rural sideline occupations. Regarding industrial production, we should start with light industry, and request assistance from the Allied countries in terms of raw materials, power, and technology. As for the capital problem, we will absorb floating capital as much as possible, and give support and promotion to the inherent handicrafts of the people. Our country is currently experiencing great difficulties in the exchange of goods, and the crux of the problem is the lack of transportation means. The current session also has concrete countermeasures and resolutions on this point. Pei Fuheng said: "During this meeting, the Chairman's earnest instructions were most inspiring. Increasing production is the most urgent task for our country at the moment, especially food and cotton. If the problems of clothing and food can be solved, then the people's livelihood will not be difficult to stabilize, and social order can also be relied upon to be secure. Furthermore, increasing production and ensuring security are inextricably linked. Because only when the local area is peaceful can the people engage in production work with peace of mind, and only then can production increase, and supply and demand be balanced."</p>
<h3>New Minister of Justice, Zhang Yipeng, Takes Office</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency) - The newly appointed Minister of Justice, Zhang Yipeng, arrived at the Ministry at 11:00 AM on the 16th to take office. The former Minister of Justice, Luo Junqiang, personally handed over the office and held a simple handover ceremony. The two new and old ministers then convened all the staff and gave simple speeches, which were quite earnest. The handover and inventory were completed at around 11:00 AM.</p>
<h3>American Airmen Captured in Guangdong</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 16th (Central News Agency) - During the bombing of Guangzhou by the American Air Force on December 24th last year, several aircraft were shot down by Japanese aircraft. Several of these enemy airmen attempted to escape by parachuting down in the suburbs of Guangzhou. However, the local villagers deeply resented the enemy aircraft's bombing and actively searched for and arrested them. Using various methods, they eventually captured all of them. The circumstances of the arrests are briefly recorded below:</p>
<p>A farmer named Chen from a certain village was returning home from plowing when he witnessed a large American aircraft falling while emitting fire. After arriving home, he suddenly saw several American airmen hiding in his house. He immediately reported to the nearby Japanese army. At the same time, a member of the joint defense team who was patrolling nearby also discovered American airmen hiding in the mulberry fields. He then gathered the team members who were on guard and surrounded the mulberry fields to search for them. They were arrested and handed over to the Japanese army. Furthermore, a member of a certain special task force also encountered two Americans wearing flight suits while patrolling. At that time, they asked the team member for directions and complained about being hungry. Therefore, the team member had them rest at the headquarters of the defense team and provided them with food. After the military police team arrived, they were arrested.</p>

<p>Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) - DNB's military correspondent, Setorius, stated: Since the summer, the northern sector of the Eastern Front has been quiet, but on Friday, strong enemy forces launched fierce attacks several times, but ultimately failed to break into the German lines.

Near the old Soviet-Polish border, the fighting continued, and the enemy made little progress in the areas of Velikiye Luki, Velizh, and Volynsk. In the Berdichev area, the German forces intensified their pressure on the enemy. On Thursday, the German forces annihilated a unit of tanks that had broken through to the rear, and on Friday, they annihilated two regiments of enemy forces.

<h3>Poland Declares Rejection of the Curzon Line Boundary</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 10th (Central News Agency) - The Polish government-in-exile issued a statement on the afternoon of the 14th, rejecting the Soviet proposal to use the Curzon Line as the Soviet-Polish border, and advocating the convening of a Western country conference, with Britain and the United States mediating the Soviet-Polish border issue. The anti-Axis countries avoided discussion at the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference and the Tehran Conference. Whether the British and American governments will accept the Polish government-in-exile's request for mediation is noteworthy. According to a report by the United Press on the 15th, British diplomatic authorities believe that the proposal of the Polish government-in-exile will transform the Soviet-Polish issue into a common issue of the anti-Axis countries, providing a glimmer of hope to the issue. However, well-informed sources acknowledge that British and American involvement in the issue will be fraught with difficulties. Hours after the US State Department received the request from the Polish government-in-exile, it announced only that the State Department had accepted the request document and was currently reviewing it, without expressing any other opinions. Some people believe that the Soviet Union's attitude towards Poland's demands will become a touchstone for the unity of the anti-Axis countries.</p>

<p>The price control authorities have recently been inviting leaders from various industries to hold symposiums and immediately seek evaluation data, including: 1. The highest and lowest amount of total capital. 2. The nature of the business: wholesale or retail. 3. Monthly business status: profit or loss. 4. Where the goods come from, whether they are purchased directly or allocated by the bureau, and the name of the allocation agency. 5. Total inventory of existing goods. 6.

<h3>Municipal Area's 32nd Ration of Rice to be Distributed in Advance</h3>
<p>Recently, the supply of rice in the city has improved significantly, and the black market price of rice has fallen sharply. The supply of public rationed rice was most difficult in the second half of last year. Thanks to the joint efforts of various relevant food agencies and the assistance of friendly countries in allocation, the serious threat of food shortage has gradually been alleviated. In the urban area, since the Food Bureau changed to full allocation from the 28th period, and the 29th and 30th periods were combined and issued together, the 31st period was changed to allocate 2 sheng per person, and the 32nd period was increased to 2.5 sheng per person. Moreover, the quality of the rice in this period is excellent, all of which is refined white rice. However, the rice distribution date may be delayed until after the Lunar New Year. Therefore, Ji Hua, director of the Municipal Food Bureau, in order to allow civilians to obtain better food during the Spring Festival, decided to distribute it in advance, swapping it with the 31st period. At that time, all public offices will be strictly prohibited from engaging in corruption. Citizens of all districts are encouraged to report any corruption at any time, so as to be severely punished, and thus ensure proper food administration.</p>
<p>Two Periods of Flour for Households to be Sold Starting Yesterday. The public ration offices in various districts, including Nanshi, Huxi, Xuhua Town, Hubei, the Sixth Naval District, Pubei, Punan, the city center, and Longcao Town, have already drawn 款 from the Shanghai District Flour Bran Central Allocation Office for the 25th and 26th periods of household flour on the 13th and 14th of this month. The 25th and 26th periods of household flour will be sold from yesterday until the 23rd, with each person purchasing 2 jin of first-class flour at 8 yuan per jin.</p>
<p>Mr. Wen Lanting is dedicated to serving society and has a passion for public welfare. However, he is advanced in age and his energy cannot withstand the繁劇. For the sake of his leisure and to reduce his workload, colleagues have previously requested on his behalf from all sectors not to invite him to banquets. For half a year, Old Lan has been delighted. Recently, Old Lan has found the matter of officiating weddings particularly painful, as it requires him to attend several ceremonies every auspicious day, which is time-consuming and laborious. Therefore, colleagues respectfully inform Old Lan's relatives and friends not to invite him to officiate weddings. We hope that you will understand.</p>

<h3>Characteristics of the Second Front: Observations from the German Side</h3>
<p>When will the Anglo-American forces launch their so-called Western European Second Front? What is known now is all speculation and cannot be said to be accurate information. But setting aside the question of time, it might not be meaningless to observe what kind of tactics they will adopt in the invasion of the continent.</p>
<p>Anglo-American Tactics</p>
<p>Needless to say, the characteristic of Anglo-American tactics is that they arise from the strategic foundation of "superiority in material resources." The implementer of that tactic is General Montgomery, the former commander of the British Eighth Army, and recently appointed commander of the Anglo-American anti-Axis forces in Europe. It is an interesting contrast that Wavell, the current Governor-General of India, is a proponent of infantry first, while Montgomery is a representative of mechanization. Wavell's battleground motto is "courage and decisiveness," while Montgomery's first slogan is "caution." That is to say, the former advocated that the Anglo-American forces should directly conquer Crete and the Italian mainland from North Africa, while the latter advocated that after the end of the North African campaign, the island of Pantelleria should be occupied first, and then land on Sicily.</p>
<p>Montgomery argues that operations should only be carried out within the radius of action of friendly air forces, especially fighter planes. Because of this tactic, the Anglo-American war action has been limited by geographical conditions and has been slow to progress. Setting aside political considerations, this delay in operations can be the subject of purely military study. After studying the progress of the European war, we can see that the Anglo-American forces have faithfully adhered to Montgomery's principle, gradually establishing strongholds for counterattacking Europe. The first is the English Channel, the closest distance between the British mainland and continental Europe. The second is on the southern side of the European continent, where the anti-Axis forces have already established several attack bases. That is, Corsica, which is peering at southern France, and southern Italy, which is used to attack northern Italy and southern Italy. The third is Turkey, which is becoming a problem. Geographically, it is possible to directly attack the Balkans from here. These places have already become bases for the anti-Axis forces to attack the inner and outer defense lines of Germany. Montgomery's tactics require huge amounts of military materials. Setting up so many bases inevitably disperses resources. I am afraid that the anti-Axis forces' attempt to attack Europe simultaneously is more urgent than establishing so many bases!</p>
<p>Concentrate Main Force in the West</p>
<p>Of course, we can imagine that the main force of the Anglo-American forces is always concentrated in the west, and a second position is set up in the Balkans to disperse the German reserve forces. British newspapers have recently been estimating the actual number of German strategic reserves, and these German strategic reserves, like the air force, are the dividing point for determining whether the Second Front can be launched.</p>
<p>Neutral countries observe that the invading army and the defending army are gradually increasing their forces on both sides. The question is "when?" There are other factors, namely the adjustment problem with the Red Army's winter offensive. The Red Army's winter operations are usually stuck in a quagmire period of one to three months. Therefore, the period must be in 芷月 or February. Another powerful British newspaper said.</p>
<p>"These two months will be devoted to strengthening the 'air offensive' against continental Europe, attempting to disrupt the German transportation organization from the air."</p>
<p>The tone of this newspaper still relies on the air force. Therefore, with the coming of spring, the issue of invading Europe is gradually becoming a reality. A Zurich newspaper reported the views of the Berlin authorities, saying: It is expected that "there is a possibility of invasion in January and February," which is now the most noteworthy. Because during these two months, the political elements may correspond to the Soviet offensive and play a major role. (Xiang: Tan from the January 5 Western Asahi Shimbun)</p>
<h3>Municipal Propaganda Office Holds Seventh Press Conference</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report: The Municipal Propaganda Office held its seventh press conference in the conference room on the second floor of the Municipal Government at 2:00 PM the day before yesterday (January 15). More than 30 reporters from various newspapers and news agencies and representatives from various agencies attended. The meeting was presided over by Liang, the head of the Propaganda Office (Secretary Pan 代). The questions raised by the newspaper reporters and the answers from the representatives of various agencies are recorded below:</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth Rationing Issues</p>
<p>National News Agency asked: The Economic Bureau previously stated that cotton cloth rationing would be implemented in February of this year. Retail cloth merchants in the market have actually started selling cloth, with each person being able to purchase 1.5 zhang with their citizen card. Is this sale of cloth from the so-called reserve, and is there still a difference from the cotton cloth that will be truly distributed to users in the future? In particular, when citizens currently go to purchase cloth with their citizen cards, cloth merchants offer fabrics with patterns at a price of 40 to 50 yuan per chi, and claim that the limited-price blue and white cloth is sold out. Citizens are still unable to obtain the necessary fabrics. Should the authorities improve this method of selling cloth, or find a better solution?</p>
<p>Economic Bureau responded: The basic plan for cotton cloth rationing is being actively researched by the Cotton Industry Management Office of the Commercial Association. After the plan is decided, rationing can be implemented. The current purchase of 1.5 zhang of cloth from retailers with a citizen card refers to half of the reserve, which is fundamentally different from the cotton cloth that will be officially rationed in the future. As for retail stores that raise prices or engage in other illegal activities, they will be severely punished once detected.</p>
<p>Allocation Issues in Each District</p>
<p>Ping Bao asked: The implementation of allocated items in this city always prioritizes the first and eighth districts. For example, the allocation of matches and soap has been implemented twice in the first and eighth districts, but other districts have not yet implemented it. Can the allocation of materials be consistent in all districts in the future? Please explain in detail to address public concerns.</p>
<p>Economic Bureau answered: After the implementation of allocated items in the first and second districts, this bureau is also actively preparing. It has now been decided to start allocating three items, namely matches, soap, and coal briquettes, on the 20th of this month. As for the four suburban districts, due to the relationship between the standard quantity of materials being moved out, it has been submitted to the Materials Control Review Committee. Once the review is approved, it will also be implemented</p>
<p>Issue of Submitting Scrap Iron</p>
<p>Ping Bao asked: It is said that households in the Seventh District have received a notice that each household must donate 2 jin of scrap iron and submit it by January 10. If they do not donate, the household's rice allocation will be suspended. Is this order to donate iron mandatory? If there is no scrap iron to donate, will the allocation of rice be suspended? Please provide detailed information on the cause of this issue, so that it can be published in the newspaper for public awareness.</p>
<p>Municipal baojia Committee: The issue of collecting scrap metal between this committee and the Second Police Bureau is purely a matter of residents freely donating. There is no quantity requirement and it does not involve the allocation of rice. For the scrap iron donation campaign in each district, residents who donate iron will receive a receipt. Those who do not donate iron will not be recorded in any way. From this, it can be seen that some baojia heads are enthusiastic about patriotism and occasionally use encouraging language to urge residents to donate actively. They are also aiming to collect easily and complete the mission of donating iron early to serve the country with enthusiasm, which should not be criticized.</p>

<h3>Western Youth Basketball Tonight: Huaying vs. Dongfang, Giant vs. Sanlun</h3>
<p>There are four Western Youth Basketball League games tonight, starting at 6:15 PM in the association's gymnasium. In Group B, Tongyi will play against the Japanese Association, and Maoling will play against Lianqing. In Group A, Dongfang and Huaying will meet at 8:00 PM. Dongfang has Bao Songyuan, Xu Wenkui, Zhang Shaoqing, Lu Zhongen, and has also invited Wang Jinghu and Du Bensheng from Suzhou, and Zhang Jia was invited from 锡. In the game against Tongren, the absence of Bao Songyuan led to a Waterloo, which is a pity. Tonight, they should be confident of victory against Huaying. However, under the guidance of Qian Xucang, Huaying's basketball skills are improving daily. If Shu Zhou and Liu Qiong can all be present, they will pose a considerable threat to Dongfang. The final game is another Group A game where the Western Youth local team Giant will face Sanlun. Although Sanlun has two veteran generals, Chuan Xiangrui and Zou Ziren, it may be difficult to blunt their edge. The schedule for tonight is as follows:</p>
<p>Tongyi - Japan (B1) 6:15 PM, Maoling - Lianqing (B2) 7:10 PM, Huaying - Dongfang (Group A) 8:00 PM, Sanlun - Giant (Group A) 9:00 PM.</p>

<h3>Reissued Number 18: Six Days of Drifting on a Deserted Island</h3>
<p>In order to defeat the enemy, the earth-shattering and awe-inspiring courageous fighting spirit of our pilots has been brought into full play, whether in the icy and snowy north or the sweltering south. However, hidden within such admirable and tear-jerking war results, and within such outstanding and ingenious operations, are countless unimaginable heroic sacrifices and sublime mental fortitude. The miraculous survival of Captain 〇〇 and his eleven subordinates is not only a legend within the unit, but also a true reflection of the pilot's fighting instincts.</p>
<p>In the 〇〇 area, thick with the clouds of war, the enemy launched a preemptive counterattack, initiating operations in the 〇〇 area. It was at this moment that Captain 〇〇, entrusted with an important mission, led his subordinates, piloting their aircraft, towards the next airbase. After taking off, the aircraft proceeded towards its destination. After 〇 hours, for some unknown reason, the engine on the right suddenly stopped. The pilot was Lieutenant 〇〇, who had been safely flying for fifteen years. With the utmost composure, he diligently engaged in repairs. However, during this period, the engine on the left also suddenly stopped. At this time, they were in the sky at an altitude of 〇 thousand meters, with the turbulent ocean below. Although the lieutenant exerted all his strength, there was no room for hesitation or indecision. The 〇〇 archipelago was still very far away, and at this point, they were powerless. The only option was to land on the water. However, the lieutenant continued to frantically tinker with the engine. It was then that he spotted two uninhabited islands in the sky. But the plane slowly lost altitude and was eventually forced to land on the sea. At this moment, the subordinates only cared about the captain. They placed the life raft, which had been prepared long ago, on the water, loaded important documents and swords onto it, and then helped the captain aboard. They all prayed and blessed the captain.</p>
<p>Finally, the plane landed on the water, but in an instant, it sank to the bottom of the sea. Everyone followed the captain and quickly began to evacuate. Everything happened in a flash. Indeed, no sooner said than done. Protecting the life raft carrying the captain, they began to swim towards the distant and faint deserted island. Although the deserted island was only six kilometers away, the area around it had rapidly changing currents and waves, making it very difficult to reach the shore. Exhausted, after three hours of arduous struggle, and expending tremendous effort, they still could not lie down for a moment. Although everyone was happy to be saved, they were very concerned about how to get the captain back. A certain captain invigorated his overly tired body and began to look for a place to land on the island. On the isolated island in the South Sea, as dusk approached, the captain discovered a narrow sandy beach by the water's edge. All they had were two bottles of soda and a coconut shell. Besides that, there were lush forests and the sea island. While wandering on the sandy beach, his foot fell into a hole. Upon digging, he discovered human bones buried inside. The captain quietly reburied the bones and called all the personnel to the sandy beach. They sat and waited, spending the first night of their ordeal.</p>
<p>The First Night</p>
<p>Gathered on the sandy beach, everyone was overwhelmed by hunger, cold, and fatigue. They decided to make a fire to keep warm, but during the swim, their upper clothing and shoes were washed away. They only had two lighters to start a fire. They gathered dry firewood, but it was difficult to ignite. The first lighter did not work. Finally, the last one managed to start a fire. Everyone felt warmer, and the cold was driven back. However, they could not find food or water. At first, they didn't care and ran to the seashore to drink seawater, but the more they drank, the thirstier they became. They gathered dry branches from the forest, dimly illuminated by the moonlight, to make a fire. However, countless snakes and lizards crawled out of the forest and gathered around us, who were exhausted. Many unseen and unheard-of poisonous insects crawled out of the sand, stinging and biting us, making it impossible to sleep. The sounds of unknown strange birds constantly echoed from the forest, piercing the sky, making us feel extremely desolate! In the middle of the night, some people fell asleep because they could not bear the fatigue, but fearing sudden attacks from floods and wild beasts, they kept watch. That's how they spent the night.</p>
<p>The Second Day</p>
<p>Before dawn, they hurriedly got up to look for food. But there were no coconuts, no bananas, and no water to drink. It was truly a barren land. Immediately, they divided into search teams and camp construction teams. The search teams immediately took office and began searching for water and food. However, the only result was gathering sour and inedible tree fruits from the forest, which were still unusable. Later, they thought of catching clams or crabs in the sand, but their tired bodies were not agile, so they could only sigh in vain!</p>
<p>For an entire day and night, without food or drink, they crossed the forest in the afternoon and discovered water. It was rainwater stored on the shaded side of the rocks. The discoverer could not help but drink heartily. However, upon closer inspection, they found countless mosquito larvae tumbling up and down inside. Others filtered it slightly and drank it. Because the water tasted good, everyone forgot themselves. At dusk, some people planned to catch birds and beasts in the forest, but they returned empty-handed. Although they had seen large lizards about two meters long and the strange birds mentioned in Aesop's fables, they could only sigh in joy. There were also many fish, but it was too difficult to catch them. Thus, another long day passed in vain. Planes flew very high in the sky, but to us, they looked like small boats on the distant horizon, disappearing without a trace in a blink of an eye. We just sighed deeply, staring blankly at the world where the sky and water merged into one. In extreme hunger and fatigue, we welcomed the arrival of the god of night.</p>
<p>The Third Day</p>
<p>The entire morning was spent searching for food, just like yesterday. The result was only some leaves and seawater. Even the rainwater stored on the shaded side of the rocks was gone. Therefore, in the afternoon, they decided to leave this deserted island, which was useless to keep and a pity to abandon. There was a large island three hundred meters to the north. Between the two islands, dangerous and rapid waves were surging. At the same time, there were schools of large sharks, more than four meters long, lurking back and forth. There was no more dangerous current than this. The raft built by the camp construction team at great cost sank to the bottom of the sea with three people on board. It was truly a waste of countless efforts. Just as everyone was in great disappointment, they finally discovered the lost life raft. In the afternoon, they began to move to the other shore. Although it was only three meters from one island to the other, this movement was a very painstaking task. They had to transport the "seed of fire" that they depended on for survival. It took almost an hour to cross safely. This isolated island with a circumference of six kilometers still had no food, but they found a clear spring of water gushing from the ground, which was truly something to thank heaven and earth for.</p>
<p>The Fourth Day</p>
<p>From about two o'clock in the middle of the night to seven o'clock, there was an extremely fierce storm. The seed of life that they had carried with great effort was extinguished while everyone was dreaming. But if they continued like this, they would only be waiting for death. They had to continue their efforts and desperately escape from the dangerous situation. After the camp construction team repaired the life raft, Lieutenant 〇〇 and Sergeant 〇〇 began rowing around noon. Everyone exchanged water cups and bid a painful farewell. Before this, they had seen planes twice and fishing boats two or three times, but they had disappeared in the blink of an eye, only giving us some disappointment. The people left on the island placed infinite expectations on these two adventurers and prayed in their hearts for a smooth journey and success.</p>
<p>The Fifth Day</p>
<p>Hunger is physiologically unbearable. The young people wanted to talk about delicacies, to overcome their hunger, so they turned over the recipes in their minds, talking about "品洋大魚麵" (a type of fish noodle) and shredded pork noodles, etc. But the more they talked, the hungrier they became.</p>
<p>The subordinates wanted their superiors not to worry about them, but the captain's concern for his subordinates grew stronger and stronger, always treating their affairs as his own. Especially the ancient samurai stories, such as Ishida Mitsunari, the day before he was sentenced, because his subordinates usually loved him so much, they offered him persimmons to eat. However, Mitsunari said that the persimmons were poisonous and not suitable for his skin, so he declined his subordinates. This kind of gratitude eventually became a good story for modern people. A warrior who shoulders the heavy responsibility of the motherland passes on his affairs to his subordinates, hoping that the last person can complete the task. Also, some subordinates received orders from the captain to investigate the forest. When he successfully completed the task and returned to report to the officer, he reported as solemnly as usual, saying "no change," but exhausted, after reporting, he fainted after escaping the officer's sight. This military spirit of not wanting the superiors to see their fatigue brought tears to everyone's eyes.</p>
<p>The Sixth Day</p>
<p>Lieutenant 〇〇, who was on a liaison mission, encountered the typical torrential rain of the South Seas on the night of his departure, but desperately propped up the life raft and headed east in the ocean. On the sixth day, after indescribable difficulties, he was overjoyed to encounter a local fishing boat. The indigenous people, trusting the Imperial Army, gave the overly tired lieutenants food and water. However, the two of them did not eat first, but immediately went to contact friendly forces. However, their destination was a night's journey away. The two rowed the life raft. According to the fisherman, they went south. After rowing for four hours, Heaven finally had eyes and sent a savior. On this day, a transport ship of the 〇〇 unit, which was specially sailing in this area, discovered these two warriors. The transport ship heard the words of the two warriors and immediately rushed to the distressed island. As the sun was setting, a sergeant on the cape of the deserted island suddenly shouted loudly: "Ship, a ship is coming!" Captain 〇〇 climbed to the cape and saw that it was indeed a ship, and it seemed to be gradually approaching. After seeing clearly, the captain went to report to the captain. The ship was none other than a transport ship. Anchoring five hundred meters from the shore, emitting white smoke, the whistle of the small speedboat sounded. Thanks to everyone's efforts and help, the captain and all the people were saved. On the seventh day after the disaster, they returned to the 〇〇 base.

<h3>Ferry on the Irrawaddy River</h3>
<p>Our target, the Arakan Mountains, is on the opposite bank of the river, far away. The car from Yangon ends at the Irrawaddy River. From here, there is nothing but ferries and trucks.</p>
<p>The Irrawaddy River in the rainy season is truly a torrent of muddy water, with a flow of five or six meters. One can imagine the hardship of the boats crossing this torrent. The opposite bank is 1,500 meters away, with green hills stretching endlessly. The military ferry, with steamers towing boats connected together, forms a large arc, lying horizontally on the pier. A group of soldiers seemingly returning one after another, and horses and cars disembarking from the ship, and the group waiting on the shore alternately boarded the ship. Not knowing when enemy planes would come, everyone was nervous and no one spoke. (Drawn by Kashiwabara Kakutaro) (Based on the Asahi Shimbun)</p>

<h3>A Lonely Story (Two)</h3>
<p>— Hong Ying</p>
<p>(Three)</p>
<p>A sudden whistle startled me from my thoughts. I was surprised, puzzled, and didn't know what misfortune was about to follow. Then I heard the sound of galloping hooves and noisy whispers. I was shaking. I knew the robbers had come.</p>
<p>Sure enough, they came in. There were a dozen people with fleshy faces. Just seeing those sturdy bodies was frightening enough.</p>
<p>When I was twenty years old, didn't I tell you? I was originally a strong and wealthy man, and my master often boasted about my strong body in front of his guests, but compared to them, I was so small and pitiful!</p>
<p>They stood in front of me, the tallest one rolled his eyes and said to me:</p>
<p>"Hey! Be sensible, take out everything you have!"</p>
<p>"King, King, I am a courier delivering official documents. I don't have anything!" I was so scared that I didn't dare to look at him. "Nonsense, take it out quickly, or see what this is?" As he spoke, he drew out a shining knife. I lowered my head, took out my official documents, and took out all the money I had on me.</p>
<p>"King, is this all there is?"</p>
<p>"Bullshit, is this all there is? Okay, we don't want your official documents, brothers, take the money, let's go to the second room!"</p>
<p>They left, and I was finally relieved. Although I lost the money, the official documents were still here, which was a great fortune in misfortune, so I closed the door.</p>
<p>But, here they come again. This time it was a man, the one who took the money from the table just now, but because it was only one person, I felt much more relieved.</p>
<p>"Hey, take out the official documents, quickly!" "Didn't the king see them just now?"</p>
<p>"Nonsense, quickly, take them out!"</p>
<p>"But, the official documents, I can't."</p>
<p>"Damn it, you won't take them out?" Then came a stick, hitting my head. I raised my arm to meet it, and as a result, I was knocked to the ground. My arm felt like it was broken and was in pain. He took the official documents. He wanted to put them in his arms, but I stood up again. I wanted to snatch them back, because I remembered the important words my master had told me in the morning.</p>
<p>We fought, but who knew he couldn't beat me. After only three blows, I knocked him to the ground. Then I used both hands and pressed down hard on his throat. As a result, he died, farted, and a little blood appeared on his mouth. This drop of blood slowly flowed from the corner of his mouth to my hand. That's how I ended a life.</p>
<p>They were about to leave. I heard them shouting that one of their partners was missing. I heard them walking back. I knew they were looking for him.</p>
<p>Then I heard someone walking towards my room. At this time, I was anxious. Under the anxious mood, I broke the wooden window with force and jumped out.</p>
<p>I heard someone curse "Damn it" in the room. I knew this was the person I called the king.</p>
<p>But, I didn't care anymore. I knew I had to carry my official documents on my back, get on the horse tied in the backyard, and rush forward again in the whistling wind and pitch-black darkness. Behind me, I heard the sound of galloping hooves and deep sighs. At this time, I forgot my fear, and I also forgot the cold. I just beat my horse and rushed forward in the dark.</p>
<p>When it was dawn, I arrived at the place I wanted to go to. From then on, I quit this job, although my master extremely wanted me to stay.</p>
<p>(Four)</p>
<p>In the pale yellow light, old Wang opened his chest again. Although the wind was howling outside, old Wang was excited and felt like he was burning.</p>
<p>Suddenly, with a "crash," I thought a dozen strong people had walked in again, but no, there was nothing. It was just a large rat that overturned a bottle of oil. Then it ran past me. I was finally relieved, so I scolded "evil beast." Old Wang smiled and patted me on the shoulder and said to me: "Child, don't be afraid, there will be no robbers here."</p>
<p>After he finished speaking, he continued to smoke his pipe, closing his eyes, as if he was thinking about something.</p>
<p>The wind was still roaring outside, so I felt lonely again, but in my loneliness, I was remembering a lonely story.</p>
<p>Soon, the pale yellow light gradually dimmed. This was probably because there was no oil. However, I was too lazy to look.</p>
<p>I don't know when, old Wang closed the open clothes on his chest, and his white beard gradually became invisible. [End]</p>

<p>Black eyes—like sparkling star stones inlaid in green stone, but emitting a faint and melancholic light, as if they were delicate little lambs. Living under the whip of a shrew, the black gemstones lost their luster. Red silk was also etched on the green stone—the erosion of work! The black gemstones became even dimmer and more lifeless, the green stone was covered with red silk, and finally the black gemstones and green stone were embedded in the eyes. Silent victims.</p>

<h3>Year-End Thoughts</h3>
<p>— Chai Yanheng</p>
<p>The setting sun shines on the snowy branches, how can my ambition fade? The years pass by, and the sense of righteousness grows day and night. There is only worry and suffering in the world, I hate the hearts of the people in the world. When will I rest? I have seen the faces of all the people in the world. I have pawned my clothes to barely make a living year after year. My clothes are thin, and I suffer from cold and hunger. My face is covered in dust and dirt.</p>

<h3>Revelation at Dusk</h3>
<p>— Xiao Meng</p>
<p>At dusk, whose son is singing, brewing in the static and turbid sky, is it a hymn to the Lord! I, a "Gypsy" type wanderer on the edge of the sea, cannot help but yearn for it.</p>
<p>Although I am still young, the details of childhood memories have passed away, is it sour, is it bitter, or... is it like tasting bitter coffee! What it evokes is disappointment. Is the stinging on my cheek sweat, blood, or tears?</p>
<p>From the corner by the window, I see many unfulfilled things from this golden sky, records of reliefs, but I, who have washed and ironed the ends of the earth, cannot help but stir up ripples in my heart. People say that a mother's heart is like the gentle breeze of spring, but my imagination is not like that. The heart, a mother's heart, is cold and ferocious. Is there no mother in the world who does not love her child? I ask the golden sky.</p>
<p>Her elopement made me leave my mother's care as early as five years old, drifting, drifting in the black color, and my dry heart was stained as soon as I touched it. Drifting in the sea, chasing after the waves, is it my mother's sin? Is it the sin of reality?</p>
<p>Ah! Is it blood, or tears? Soaking my cheeks. This rugged "journey of life".</p>
<p>In the corner by the window, dusk is about to end, and it is getting darker. I know that I am the first to be ravaged by the night, and I am also the one who receives the gift of love when dawn reappears.</p>
<p>I don't care if it's blood or tears? Dusk has enlightened me.</p>

<h3>International Cup Football Tournament is About to Begin Research on the Distribution of Chinese Lineup Proposed Lineup for Two Battles Against Portugal and Yi Lian</h3>
<p>The International Cup Football Tournament is about to begin. The Chinese team has selected formal representatives and has had two trial matches. However, the results of both trial matches have not been as ideal as hoped. In the future, in a formal war, judging from the current situation, there will be more bad luck than good. This can simply be said to be a matter of Chen Rong's distribution. This magazine has researched the Chinese team's lineup. Now the writer dares to offer a suggestion for research.</p>
<p>What I want to say first: is the distribution of Wu Qixiang on the right forward and the left forward of Fu Zhen. One of the five forwards must be a representative selected second. What we have to do technically is whether we can catch up "in one breath". We have spent a lot of time on the field and seen a player who can obviously catch up to get the pass.</p>
<p>Secondly, what I want to say is the "ball route". As we can think of, in some years ago there was a saying in the newspaper, "The 'Arsenal' team is the best team in England, but in the league, it lost to a mediocre team, which was completely a failure of the 'ball route'". This can also be seen in Shanghai. The Chinese team has repeatedly suffered from the Portuguese, like Jia Youliang meeting Ma Shan'er, and Shu Linjing encountering Kao Sitan, which is the so-called "nemesis", which will change the original appearance.</p>
<p>Finally, of course, it is to observe the recent situation of each player and make a decision. I would like to contribute two lineups.</p>
<p>Lineup for the Battle Against Portugal</p>
<p>The battle against Portugal should be like this. Goalkeeper Liu Xianhan, right inside defender Zhang Lin'gen, left inside defender Li Ning, center defender Tan Wei. The forwards will use Donghua's Dai, Han, Sun, Jia, and Li five tigers. My reason is very simple. The only disadvantage of this lineup is that Li Ning and Dai Linjing cannot catch up in one step, but Li Ning can stand in the best position to make up for it. Fu's pass is quite good, and the five forwards have a considerable understanding. This can be seen in Donghua's successive offensives in this session. Now with Wu Qixiang and Song Lingsheng as dribbling forwards, it will increase their offensive firepower considerably. As for why Zheng Yingquan and Chu Yongfu are not considered on the center defender line, I can say for sure that it is because their recent situation is not good. Zheng lacks finesse, and Chu is too draggy, which is a fact that perhaps no one can deny. For the right wing position, if Ma Shan'er plays, some people may think that Fei Chunhua should be used, but I think this is absolutely not desirable. Because Ma Shan'er is in a situation of declining every day, while Jia's recent situation is in normal progress. He is currently the most ideal person in Shanghai. His fast dribbling and appropriate hooking in the middle, the aging Ma Shan'er, no matter what, cannot stop him as he did in the past.</p>
<p>Lineup for the Battle Against Yi Lian Team</p>
<p>The battle against Yi Lian should be like this. Goalkeeper Liu Xianhan, right inside defender Zhang Lin'gen, left inside defender Wu Qixiang, center defender Duo Fuzhen, right forward Zheng Yingquan, left forward Song Lingsheng, and the forwards are still the Donghua five generals. It is very obvious that in terms of defense, a crisp kick should be used to resist Yi Lian. That's why I have this question. At least Xu Wen should replace Dai Linjing or Chu Longhai. The watch thinks not. Because Dai has a good pass that can be distributed to the right forward, and Chen used to be able to catch up. Now Han Longhai has also understood this, so Han can often have records. However, his kick is not necessarily good. He often tries this trick.</p>
<p>My views are as above. I wrote them in a hurry, so there are many shortcomings, of course, but I just hope that all sectors will refer to them. It must be stated that it is by no means deliberately mystifying, I hope readers will appreciate it!</p>
<h3>The Western Youth Basketball Tournament Organizers Should Pay Attention to Order - Last Friday's Incident Led to Ticket Refunds</h3>
<p>Last week's Western Youth basketball game, the contest between the Shaoqiang team wasn't particularly exciting. The shift to the Shantou team versus the Monacos team, the organizers' last-minute rescheduling, led numerous spectators to demand ticket refunds. The situation at the time was quite chaotic. It's clear that the current Western Youth organizers lack managerial competence. In minor matters, such as ticket issues, when strong teams play, spectators struggle to purchase tickets and are forced to buy black market tickets to gain entry. Another issue is seating. Downstairs seats are officially divided into 26-yuan and 13-yuan categories. Those with 26-yuan tickets are supposed to be seated by number, but in reality, those with 13-yuan tickets can easily sit in the 26-yuan seats, while those with 26-yuan tickets can only sit in the 13-yuan seats, with no one intervening. Furthermore, it's difficult to find our reporters in the press box, leaving them standing awkwardly in a corner, making reporting difficult. Regarding the rescheduling of the Shantou team versus the Monacos team, according to the Shantou team's representative, they had requested approval two days in advance, but the organizers didn't inform the newspapers. According to one reporter, they had spoken with Western Youth by telephone the day before, but the rescheduling wasn't mentioned, showing how careless their handling was. As a result, all the newspapers printed the original schedule as usual, causing a disturbance. Fortunately, Liu Hesheng, in a moment of quick thinking, had the Shantou team gather remaining players to form a friendly match against the Monacos team, placating the audience. However, this reporter sincerely hopes that the Western Youth organizers will learn from this incident and strive for improvement in all aspects in the future, which would be fortunate. The following is a review of last week's matches.</p>
<p>Review of Last Week's Matches</p>
<p>In the match between Eastern and Shantou, Eastern only had five players available that day, and they were fortunate to have Fan Qingxian assisting, otherwise they would have only had four players, making defeat inevitable. The Shantou team played very hard in this match, shedding their arrogant attitude from last week's game against Tongren, and restoring their previous proactive style. The entire team adopted a five-man zone defense, which was very tight, and their offense featured beautiful passing and made use of their superior physical strength, resulting in unusually swift attacks. Eastern adopted a man-to-man defense, but their strength was insufficient. Fan Qingxian has been away from the game for a long time and was understandably flustered. Fortunately, Xu Wenkui and Zhang Shaoqing's shooting accuracy allowed them to win by a narrow margin.</p>
<p>After Qian Xucang's return, the morale of the Huaying team was boosted, and they certainly had hopes of victory against Huainan. After Luo Nansan's defeat, he gradually became disheartened. Both teams adopted a zone defense, attacking and defending in turns, exerting their utmost strength. Huainan's victory was due to Hu Jingui's successful shot from the sideline, and Liu Fushan's one-handed drive down the middle. Huaying's shooting accuracy was lacking, and Gao Mangsheng couldn't always come through. The difference between winning and losing lay in this.</p>
<p>Tongren versus Yuren. The former is young and promising, while the latter is old and sluggish. In this game, the veteran team actually managed to win by half a point, entirely due to Chen Xianglong's individual success. Chen Xianglong is tall and strong, and no one on the Tongren team could stop him from following up his shots, leading to a miserable defeat. Tongren evolved from using a five-man zone defense to sometimes using two players to guard one. When Xianglong followed up, they should have assigned two players to guard him closely, but Tongren didn't know how to take advantage of this, resulting in a tactical failure! Furthermore, Qian Junqiu was late in making passes, and his passes were often wasteful, otherwise they could have won by several points easily.</p>
<p>Lianxi's crushing defeat of Dahua was like using a rock to break an egg. Lianxi hasn't even used its formal lineup yet, and team captain Zhang Gangxiang even made an appearance in uniform, not seeking much. However, due to the disparity in strength, the winners were able to attack and defend effectively, with a variety of tactics. The losers tried their best to defend, but to no avail. The resulting score difference was too large.</p>
<p>Yuren's third match, which was a makeup game against the Monacos team, was the same as their match against Tongren. Observing Yuren's offensive tactics, they were exceptionally sharp. Their only weakness was the lack of a shooting forward, relying instead on long-range shots from their two guards, which limited their scoring. Sanlun had good spirit, but insufficient stamina and a lack of staying power, which is a major weakness in basketball, inevitably led to their defeat. Yuren's performance was already at its peak, so they need to focus on improving their shooting accuracy to make a difference.</p>
<p>This Week's Schedule is Highly Anticipated</p>
<p>This week's schedule: Monday, Huaying vs. Eastern, Sanlun vs. Giants, the first game is worth watching. Wednesday, Tongren vs. Yuren, Amateur vs. Huainan. The first game is sure to be fiercely contested. And on Friday, Eastern vs. Hualian Pharmacy, and Huaying vs. Monacos, which promises to be a sensation. Eastern's hopes rest on this game, and Hualian Pharmacy can't afford to let it go easily. Eastern's official strength is no match for Hualian Pharmacy. However, Lu Zhongen can use his brain, having a clear understanding of Hualian Pharmacy's individual strengths and weaknesses, as well as the team's offensive and defensive strategies, allowing him to attack their weaknesses. Hualian must pay attention to winning tactically. The attractiveness of this match is sure to break records. This reporter hopes to see an improvement in the level of play in this game and also earnestly hopes that Western Youth will pay attention to the issue of maintaining order as soon as possible.</p>
