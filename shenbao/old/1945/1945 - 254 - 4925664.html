<h3>Most Japanese Textile Factories to be Transferred to China, Temporary Disposal Plan Decided</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, New York, 8th Dispatch – A temporary plan for the disposal of the Japanese textile industry has been decided. According to the established policy, the Japanese textile industry will manufacture goods for a certain period to meet the relief needs in the Far East. Afterwards, most Japanese textile factories will be transferred to China as part of the reparations. The transferred Japanese textile factories will increase China's cotton planting production to 600 million yards. China's current productivity is approximately 400 million yards. China's rayon production will soon be able to compete with the United Kingdom for the leading position as the largest manufacturer of rayon. According to the plan, Japanese textile production will be greatly reduced, with only 100 million yards of cotton cloth and 35 million yards of rayon produced to meet the urgent textile needs of various countries and territories in the Far East. Once the Far East's needs are met, China will receive most of Japan's textile factories. Only 40% of the cotton weaving factory and 20% of the rayon production capacity will be used for the needs of Japan itself. In this way, before 1949, Japan will fall from the second largest textile exporting country to a consumer country.</p>

<h3>Representative Chiang Issues Statement: Representative Office to Be Abolished; Local Military and Administrative Heads Arrive One After Another; Task of the Office Completed; Request to Close</h3>
<p>Chiang Bo-cheng, Chairman Chiang's representative stationed in Shanghai, recently issued a statement saying: "I was previously appointed as representative stationed in Shanghai by the Chairman's telegram. At that time, the Japanese troops had just announced their surrender, and the local military and administrative organs had not yet arrived. In order to maintain order and stabilize the people's hearts, the Representative Office was established to guide and handle everything. Relying on the Chairman's virtue and power, we safely overcame this difficult situation, and I am very gratified. Now that the large army has successively arrived in Shanghai, and the local military and administrative officials have also arrived one after another, from now on, the local military and political security will be the responsibility of others. The Representative Office was originally of a temporary transitional nature, and there is no need for it to continue to exist. Therefore, I have reported to the Chairman and will close it down and abolish it immediately. All unfinished matters will be transferred to the respective competent authorities for handling. As for matters assigned or designated for liaison by the Chairman, I will naturally continue to handle them under the name of the representative. In the past twenty days, I have deeply felt that all sectors have been able to work together to maintain local order. I hope that they will continue to make greater efforts in the future to restore normalcy as soon as possible."</p>
