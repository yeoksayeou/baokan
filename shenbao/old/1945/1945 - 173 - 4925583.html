<h3>八重岳繼續激鬥　小祿地區混戰中　日航空隊反復猛攻敵艦隊</h3>
<p>東京二十一日中央社電　冲繩本島南部地區，十七日以來，全綫仍繼續激戰，迄二十日激圖並未稍減，尤以戰綫中央部八重瀨岳方面，敵軍曾對日軍陣地展開熾烈猛攻，日軍頃　追邀擊，現正激戰中。</p>
<p>琉球羣島基地二十一日中央社電冲繩本島南端地區敵軍，逐次由東海岸綫向八重瀕岳南側日軍陣地侵入，日軍部隊則對之展開白刃戰，予敵慘重損失，現正繼續奮戰中。又小祿地區之戰况，現已演成混戰狀態，日海軍部隊十八日下午七時三十分，會對敵陣敢行總突擊，該方面戰况似已步入最後階段。</p>
<p>琉球羣島基地二十一日中央社電日航空部數二十日夜曾對冲繩本局周　之敵艦船加以反覆猛攻，歷數小時之久。又二十日本島南部地區沿岸，有敵水上艦艇羣砲擊岸上，該地日軍曾與之交戰。</p>
<h3>皖飭屬協助糧運蘇集團採購雜糧</h3>
<p>蚌埠二十一日中央社電　國府當局對米糧採取緊急措置後，各地民金題已趨安定，茲皖省府已奉行政院所頒之實施方案，並已轉電　各專署等切實運辦。</p>
<p>蘇州二十一日中央社電　蘇省府爲解決民食間題，除巳分期配給麵粉幷抑平米價及作各項有效準備外，復於昨日召集全省雜糧麵粉各業公會理事長三十餘人，舉行懇談會，由孫建廳長主席，代表任省長諄諄訓勉，當即議決：　繼續麵粉配給，　　團採辦雜糧，　開始雜　配給，　管理麵粉廠，　舉辦小麥及麵粉搬運登記等各要案，結果至爲圓滿。</p>
<h3>艦載機三百架　空襲大鳥島</h3>
<p>中部太平洋基地二十一日中央社電敵艦上機於二十日拂曉來襲大島易，綜計先後來襲之機數有三百架，日駐屯部隊　戰，將其擊退。</p>
<h3>蘇聯被救船員　感謝日優待</h3>
<p>札幌二十一日中央社電　蘇聯貨船特關斯波羅的號（一萬噸），本月十三日，向海參威歸航中，於　太近海，會遭美潛水艦之攻擊，該船搭乘船員中九十四名，已爲日海被收容於樺太西海岸本斗町之旅館內。該船之搭乘員等，異常應謝此次被救悅中，當前後被救之遭難者抵本斗町時，猶在夕刻，相互擁抱，熱狂已極，蓋被救之搭乘員九十四名，其中行踪不明之五名，似已被難。被救者中，復有女子搭乘員五名，全體竟無一人負傷，均極健壯，寓居現地旅館，對日方之保護頗爲感謝，當地記者往訪時，彼等連稱感謝不止，船長葛巴里羅夫氏，代表全體向記者語謂：自　救以來，受日本官憲倍極優待，我等惟有感謝而已。</p>
<h3>渝軍總反攻　尚在準備中</h3>
<p>中央社訊　重慶軍事當局，最近盛稱總反攻態勢已到達某種階段，並謂已在全戰綫發動總反攻云云，惟重　軍車情勢，實際上未能如重慶意料之好轉，以公正之目光判斷，猶未脫離局部反攻之階段。重慶方面軍事措置，日來各方面多有從事改編者，但其兵力配置，仍以中央直系軍配置於昆明，重慶以及受中共包圍之陝西地區，前統僅調派雜軍或傍系軍，惟揚于江以南與日軍間之作戰正面，將以往之戰區　分制改變，創設中國陸軍總司令部，何應欽担任總司令，屬其指揮下之湖南·貴州·雲南等地域，劃分四個方面軍，糾合去年至今春湖南·廣西作戰之殘部，加以改編。此外，又期待於利用史蒂威爾公路接濟，急於美式配備，據傳現已完成十師以上軍事措置，即重慶所誇示之總反攻。然日軍突然對河南北部及江西南部採取攻勢作戰，使該兩地區之重慶野戰軍受慘重打擊·河南北部方面，日軍在　氏四周，江西南部在龍南·定南·虔南。所謂三南地區深入，經數日戰鬥，已完全攻陷，該兩地區日軍今後作戰，循如何途徑而進雖不可知，然日軍先發制人的攻勢已達到目的，於此次作戰，亦可見重慶之總反攻態勢極爲脆弱，尚在初期階段。據美國著名軍事評論家史文格於最近出版之雜誌上　，「重慶軍事行動尚未達到反攻地步」，且重慶以中央直糸軍配置於後方，是爲避免日軍直接强大壓力，又以雜軍及份系軍調前機作戰，乃企圖使其自然淘汰，此種用意不難想見。現重　努力加強戰力準備反攻，此固不容否認，然各戰綫之軍事活動，今日尚不出局部的　動。</p>
<h3>陳憲兵司令　赴蕪視察</h3>
<p>蕪湖二十一日中央社電　中央憲兵司令陳　，爲視察駐蕪憲兵勤務及本區一般軍政情沉，日前由京乘車蒞蕪，下軍後，即赴憲兵隊本部視察，幷對所屬官兵訓話，旋接見記者，發表談，闡述此行任務。</p>
<h3>京市昨空襲</h3>
<p>南京二十一日中央社電二十一日二時零五分及四時十七分，敵機一架二次侵人京市上空，於地上防空砲火猛射下，即倉皇向東南方面遁走。</p>
<h3>各地土布增產　運銷滬市</h3>
<p>棉紗布收買後·各地以衣著當要，乃紛紛興起手工業紡織土紗布土，謀自給自足，生產多餘部份，亦供應市面。頃據工業界消息，滬市各工廠交織之布類，以原料成本基重，售價步趨高昂，市民購買力，甚爲薄弱，故邇來各地商人，以土紗土布製品由木機逐步改良，紡織煉染，亦較以前略有進步，花色品質，漸見優良，生產數呈頻增，乃紛將此項出品大量遝滬分別應市，市民多以價廉關係遂均購製衣着，銷路之廣，已打破以前記錄。另悉各地土布製造業營業鼎盛，由上海運往外埠之染料數量，業已與日俱增。</p>
<p>日根道廣吉氏任駐華參事官</p>
<p>東京二十一日中央社電　日大東亞省大臣官房會計課長根道廣吉氏，調任駐中華民國大使館參事官，已於二十日正式任命。</p>
<p>魯撤銷四縣治</p>
<p>濟南二十一日中央社電山東省臨沂·日照。諸城·莒縣等縣縣治，實行撤銷，改設辦事處，以節經費。至辦事處主任一職，刻正由楊省長銓衡中，不久即可發表。</p>
<p>美在華府舉行陸軍航空會議</p>
<p>里斯本二十一日中央社電　據華盛頓電稱，馬利亞納基地美第二十一轟炸隊司令官落梅少將，十七日乘　型機由夏威夷返抵華盛頓，出席最近於華盛頓舉行之陸軍航空本部會議。</p>
<h3>冲繩作戰　敵美戰略失敗　軍事評論家談國際情勢</h3>
<p>某軍事評論家，頃對冲繩戰况及國際情勢，發表談話如次：</p>
<p>沖繩敵軍戰略失敗</p>
<p>來襲沖繩之敵軍航空隊，以敵機甚少，毫無活躍現象，日特攻隊對從南部地區移動集中之敵戰艦，巡洋艦，　逐艦掩　陸上部隊之敵艦羣，依然繼續猛烈攻擊。日軍獲得堅强之南方機點，繼續猛烈堅强戰關。關於敵在冲　戰略失敗，敵軍評論家漢蓀。包爾溫曾嚴　抨擊，勞倫斯亦對尼米資加以非難。從牧港·嘉敷，津　戰關開始以來，已經三個月之久，現在到眞壁綫，南北十四公里，每日前　僅一七五米，從收港經嘉敷到　壁七公里，敵兵力有八萬之多。（六個師團全部）。</p>
<p>克那論作戰困難</p>
<p>巴克那中將未死前，曾在司令部會見記者，關於沖繩島作戰困難有所批評云：「日在　里一帶防禦綫，使美軍在太平洋上所遭遇之最堅強據點，除硫磺島外，以此爲最。美軍復以大雨，機械部隊行動困難，陷於苦戰。」美軍以沖繩島南部海濱暗礁，及攻防戰初期戰術展開，故在冲島登陸作戰較少，以保持機械性有利點，遂集中在一個戰綫上。敵軍起而初在冲繩南部湊川期圖登陸，數次均遭失敗，後調第一第六海兵團無效，遂又加入南下陸軍部隊內，故美評論家對此次作戰大肆抨擊：美軍失敗將兵力集中一條戰綫上</p>
<p>敵美所受損害加倍</p>
<p>在首里日軍予敵以相當損拼，其主要原因巴克那中將曾對記者談稱：「假如美軍在沖島能使用所有登陸部隊，上陸的海軍及道路，定極繁雜，同時因兵數加倍，可對日軍加以不斷壓迫，結果美軍所受損書，亦將加倍。」美軍之失敗因用一面攻擊，故使地上部隊損害有八萬之衆，並經過入十日之長久時間，而英美機械部隊整日暴露在日特攻隊之下，而遭劇烈攻擊，故漢蓀包爾溫批評敵損失，最低估計三十四萬以上。勞倫斯之非難，亦極得當。其他太平洋戰綫上呂宋，婆羅洲，新幾內亞等處，日軍依然展開激戰，而予敵以相當損拼。</p>
<p>舊金山會議之收獲</p>
<p>國際悄勢，從四月廿五日開會，經過二個月的舊金山會　，造成法律式世界安全機構，至六月廿三日閉會。在未開會前，極盡宣傳之能事，而所得結果，僅一條約而已。究在世界上有何價値，只待歷史之證明耳。據最近舊金山廣播，關於委任統制制意見已一致，至從屬民族目的宣言，以及委任統制範圍內與以外之領域，聯合國目的及概念亦一致。在第一次大戰後，關於委任統制亦曾成問題。茲縱使會讓上告一段落，實際上能否解決，尚成問題。據路透社十九日華盛頓電，特魯曼十九日乘飛機由華盛頓向西海岸旅行，準備參加廿三日閉幕之舊金山會議，但據傳該會議又將延期開幕。渝方參加會議之宋子文，於廿晨偕隨員蔣夢麟等十三名，乘特別飛機返渝。</p>
<p>又據報告美駐渝大使哈來及最高指揮官威特麥爾共同聲名稱：吾人及僚屬外傳公私兩方均有對立意見，完全無稽　官吾等意見，雖傳有不同，但總可圓滿解決。駐渝美外交人員及軍事代表現亳無意見，努力工作，想將來亦如此云云。觀此聲明，即可見其反目情形。據廿日合衆社電，蘇聯廿日廣播，對渝國民黨非民主主義之獨裁，加以誹謗。</p>
<p>蘇聯動向頗堪注視</p>
<p>世界將來展望·曾事擴大宣傳之舊金山會議，已告一段落，波蘭，及中亞黎巴嫩等問題，亦告結束，此僅爲暫時結東，未可謂爲眞正解決。今後蘇聯動向，對世界局勢頗堪重視。三巨頭會于　擴在英總　後七月上旬於柏林郊外某處舉行，屆時史太林採取如何態度，為一極有興味之問題。</p>
<p>美軍並無實際行動</p>
<p>一方面太平洋職局以美軍在冲總失敗，美軍士氣不振，而對日本士作戰，僅口呼喊，並無實際行動。麥克沃塞組織西太平洋後方司令部，為將來對日作戰運輸，補充，建設，衛生之準備，委任威廉斯太爾中將爲司令官，此表示美軍有由尼米資短期作戰戰法轉變為麥克沃塞長期作戰之趨向。究竟敵美今後能繼續　年，當拭目以待。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>注視大陸戰局動向</h3>
<p>自歐戰結束以來，敵方誇大宣傳對日本的移兵總攻計劃。但是，實際上自五月八日德國屈服以來，將近一個半月，敵方對東亞的軍事，始終沒有重大的變動，甚至在冲繩島的戰役中，犧牲了敵方的總司令官，而仍未能戰勝盟邦的特攻精神。今後不問敵方的戰略如何轉變，盟邦自經這次八十七屆臨時議會以後，已逐步完成本土全域戰塲化的堅强防衛能　。所以，至目前爲止，敵人對日本本土速戰速決的戰略，顯然無法實現了。</p>
<p>敵人今後戰略目標的動向，固然很難推斷，大致在三頭會議未護結論以前，不會有什麽決定性的行動。但是這並不能爲我們鬆懈對敵訪衛的理由。特別是對於中國大陸作戰，無論今後的國際局勢如何演變，敵人這種戰略不會設變，而且只會强加的。同時，重慶陣營的兩大勢力，不管他們今後是合作抑是火併，他們都沒有反對中國大陸戰塲化的覺悟，他們都有利用大陸作戰而擴張自己勢力的金圖，因此，中國大陸戰塲的前途，是値得隨警惕的。</p>
<p>近來敵人英美封於大陸沿海岸各地的登陸企圖，似有逐漸準備的傾向　同特，重慶和延安，也正穴傳在各地進行所謂「　反攻」的部署。從全中國的命運來　，顯然是非常不幸的。</p>
<p>現在盟邦在華部隊，在大陸各綫發動新攻勢，在中原及東南各地區，部以閃擊的姿　，獲得決定性的勝利，尤其是廣東及江西地區，把盤據於華南區要之地的渝軍主力六萬之　州，予以打擊，造成江西三南之捷。道次盟軍在中國大陸的攻勢，一方而粉碎了最近一二個月間關於中國戰塲的一切謠言和猜測，另方面更表現了盟軍的實力，足以使重慶及延安軍隊最後考慮，究克歸返東亞與日本共同保衛東亞人之東亞呢，還是繼續　從歐美而陷國家於危亡之局？第三，最重要的是盟軍在粵贛兩省的勝利，把正在敵美指　部署的渝方反攻陣勢，加以摧毀，小而　，是給和平區的外圍造成一道新的防綫，大而　之，是替中國沿海岸加强了對敵防衛力。此外，重慶與延安雙方最近打通華中華南反攻路綫的計劃，也因此擊破了。</p>
<p>盟軍這次戰果的意義，已如上述。隨着內外特局的發展，今後大陸戰塲在大東亞戰爭決戰中的重耍性，有增無減，我們自當以這次戰役爲起點，提高應有的警惕，大家更密切的協力（，以共同保衛中國，保衛東亞。</p>
<h3>舊金山會議　定明日閉幕　宋子文前日返抵重慶</h3>
<p>東京二十一日中央社電本年四月二十五日開始舉行之舊金山會議，迄今將達兩月，業定於本月二十三日會議終了。按此次會議結果，會制定國際安全保障憲章（通稱爲舊金山憲章），極不合現實世界悄勢，故又可謂再蹈前國際聯盟之覆　，且此次舊金山會議，形式上雖告終了，然實際上波蘭問題，托里埃斯德問題，奧地利亞問題與處理德國國境問題等，極需國際安全保障機講實際處理之軍要問題，反而未加討論，而草擬新國際安全保障憲章之英·美·蘇代表，更以舊國際聯盟無武力背景，致處理國際糾紛時，無實行能力，結果遵告失敗爲理由，規定紛爭國拒絕安全保障理事會　告時，共同發動武力解決紛爭，且更制定　發動武力時，由英·美·蘇三國獨裁之安全保障理事會決定，　常任理事國之英·美。蘇·渝。法五大國中，有某一國發生國際紛爭時，該國有拒絕發動武力權利，此點當對會議席上提出時，雖經澳洲及其他各中小國反對，然常任理事會童强制通過。按此，不外理事會無權阻止五大國攻繫或侵略其他小國，因之舊金山會　乃實施地區制度，承認各地區加盟國有締結地區安全保障條約權利，換言之，亦即美·蘇兩國各於其自國所在半球上，確立木國絕到安全體制，而美。蘇兩國之激烈競爭，亦引起其他現象。吾人由舊金山俞議席上所討論國際信託問題，亦可窺知，蓋美國堅持主張此次由戰敗國奪取之各地域及上次大戰後委託國際聯盟各統治領，全爲信託地域，其佔領國於施政時，絕對由德會任命之「信託委員會」負完全責任。並聲明謂，美國於太平洋以軍力佔領之各戰略島嶼，應不受此信託委員會監督，而蘇聯亦深知美國所以提議此案，乃爲獲得太平洋上之戰略島嶼，以阻止蘇聯勢力向太平洋方面進出，故舊金山會議之蘇聯代表，乃於六月十四日之投票委員會席上突然提議，應於憲章上制定「各加盟國不論理由如何，隨時皆可退出會議」項目，反駁美國，使舊金山會議引起最後之大波瀾。</p>
<p>里斯本二十一日中央社電　據重慶電稱，宋子文已於二十日自舊金山　抵重慶。</p>
<h3>平將開始施行血型鑑定檢查</h3>
<p>北平二十一日中央社電　北平警防團救護部專門委員會，作空襲下失血後輸血之準備，需與關係機關聯絡，結果需用血淸材料及經費，在請領中，預定第一次在平市舉行　防風可少年一萬名血型鑑定檢査，日期俟材料經費領到後，即開始實施。</p>
<h3>美在太平洋設補給司令部</h3>
<p>里斯本十九日中央社電　據馬尼刺來電，麥克沃塞司令部十九日公布構，由斯　雅中將指揮之補給司令部，已設置於太平洋，該新司令部將担任將來對日總攻擊時彈藥，裝備，食糧及兵員之運輸工作。</p>
<h3>華維爾拒絕印領袖要求</h3>
<p>巴斯本二十一日中央社電　印度回教聯盟總裁　那向華維爾要求將西姆拉會議延期，業遭拒絕，又新德裡來電稱，甘地翁亦曾向華維爾耍求將二十五日舉行之西姆拉會議延期一週，改爲七月二日，然傳聞華維爾對此曾表示反對。</p>
<h3>瑞士總司令　寇松辭職</h3>
<p>百倫二十一日中央社電據此問接獲消息，瑞士國軍總司令，年邁七十一齡之寇松老將，昨日向議院呈請辭職，蓋瑞士國之軍事服役已於本年八月二十日業告終止。</p>
<h3>比國將實行　全民投票制</h3>
<p>瑞典京城二十日中央社電據英方於昨夜接護布魯塞爾之電訊稱，比利時共產黨因反對國王里奧保特之決定返國號召民衆，實行全國示威運動，茲有在阿干所率之政府內天主教徒，政黨黨員華納夫，突於昨日提出建議，將採取「全民投票」政制，以解比利時政治之危局。按華氏現任司決部長，渠提出此項建議，無非欲求國王被逼退位之問題得一解決，布魯塞爾右　政黨機關報，曾對華氏之建議評述如次，「全民選舉之政制，實爲眞正推行國內民意之唯一方策，然該項政制須在鎭靜自由，穩定管制之下漸漸推行」。</p>
<h3>法前反共聯盟總裁被判死刑</h3>
<p>里斯本二十一日中央社電據巴黎來電稱，巴黎法院十九日晨對賴伐爾部下曾對德軍協力之反共聯盟總裁曼塞爾塔，以缺席裁　，宣告死刑。</p>
<h3>英美蘇外交人員續協商波瀾問題</h3>
<p>—波政治領袖不致判死刑—</p>
<p>瑞典京城二十一日中央社電莫斯科來電，英駐莫斯科大使寇爾，十九日夜於英國大使館舉行晚餐會，招待蘇聯副外交人民委員長維辛斯基及美駐莫斯科大使哈里曼，席間就樹立新波蘭聯合政府問題加以協議。又十九日波蘭民主主義各派會議並未舉行，預定最近再行召開，討論各派具體提案。又因倫數波蘭流亡政府反蘇分子已交軍事裁判，故會議空氣漸呈緩和狀態。</p>
<p>瑞典京城二十一日中央社電據莫斯科報告稱，莫斯科法庭內昨繼續審訊十六波　政治罪犯時，檢察長阿芬西奈夫曾指稱：渠對於波蘭之四大罪魁頗無意加以死刑，然被等均應被判「終身　奪自由」之罪云。渠繼稱，大部波蘭民衆均欲在聯合國間散布離間不陸之種子，且欲使蘇聯與波蘭之人民永不能達到一互相瞭解之地步，雖奧古立基及其他被告多人均未曾親身殺戮我蘇聯軍將，然彼等應對此項殺戮我軍將情事負起全責，蓋彼等曾爲頒發訓令之教唆人。關於此點，我人已獲得明證，但目前雖稱彼等之罪應使彼等陷於死刑，然我人適屆戰爭勝利之期，彼等雖不死，亦不能加害我如是强盛少蘇維埃聯邦，故現在我　不欲將死刑加於彼等之身上。至於四波瀾罪魁中之兩主要罪魁，乃爲　奧古立基陸軍少將—波蘭國民軍總司令，　琴古斯基—倫教波流亡政府代理首相及波蘭秘密政府會議之主席，然四大罪魁已犯罪證實，彼等會為波瀾秘密政府對我蘇聯實施搗亂破壞之組織人及領袖人員，而其餘十二罪犯均將以邦犯裁決之。</p>
<h3>叙利亞境內　又起衝突</h3>
<p>甲斯本二十一日中央社電　據貝魯特昨日發出報告稱，叙利亞西北部土耳其國境綫附近之亞拉布魯斯地區，於週二又有法叙兩軍衝突之舉。傳聞法軍數隊突起向該地國民軍施以攻擊，同時在安夫拉特斯地區，亦有衝突事件發生。</p>
<h3>希特勒之死　傳係服毒　女星勃朗同時殞命</h3>
<p>瑞典京城二十一日中央社電據路透社特派訪員報告，關於德國希特勒元首在柏林總指揮署與勃朗女明星同時殉國之軼聞，於昨夜由英軍第二土一軍司令部內遭拘禁之希特勒親衛隊寇諾詳細吐露如下：余在一九四五年二月中句抵達貝許特斯加登（即希特勒別　），於該處曾親見伊伐·勃朗與希特勒元首兩人之臥室，在該兩臥室之間，　有一「關聯轉節之門」，在別墅中無人敢呼勃朗爲勃朗小姐，僅開以「伊伐·勃朗」之簡稱「E·B」喚之。當余返抵柏林，在親衛隊內相互傳聞，希特勒曾與勃朋女士在四月底舉行結婚，四月三十日我在某地下室內，突單獨遇見勃朗女士，伊頗露挹　之狀，謂：「我寗願死於此間，不欲離開再往他處」，言時聲極悲慘，其時余只得設法將伊安慰，而呼「勃朗小姐」，豈料伊急稱：「今後汝等應喚我希特勒夫人」，在柏林被圍攻之末日，總指揮署內所有親衛隊，均奉命祗能在深六十公尺之地道中通過，蓋其特蘇聯之砲火猛烈已極，希特勒元首每晚睡在營床上，但自四月十八日起，渠亦赴地道處，晝夜居留於該處。在五月一日，當余走過地道送早餐時，見希特勒靜坐於搖椅中，不斷以左手手指輕拍該椅，頗露神經過敏之態，該時適有曼古哈隊長進內，希特勒急起立與渠握手，一面追問「消息如何」？此實爲余最後一次聽聞希時勒元首之說話。在同日下午五時許通過地道時，然地道上已空無一人，四週顧望始見希特勒之親身參謀兩人沙爾，其中一人態度似極憤怨，渠見我不禁高呼「元首死矣，且爲火焰酌斃」！余折轉至該地道處，發現希特勒元百與勃朗女士之屍體、躺在距離太平門約三碼之沙地上，希特勒背向下，足膝微屈，勃朗女士貼近其身傍，面向下，兩具屍體雖均爲火所酌焦，然猶依　可辨，更能以勃朗女士所素穿之夏服及黑皮鞋，希特勒之綜色軍服認辨無誤。屍體之近旁停有四輛　托車，現在據余私人之觀察，希特勒元首與勃朗女士，均爲斯登普佛干教授所藥死，該教授為總指揮署內之最高軍醫，余發現兩具屍體後，未幾即見斯登普佛干忽忽通過地道，所以疑心彼等爲渠所藥死者，實因余會見渠於該日前夜，將希特勒元首之愛犬「波浪地」藥死，同時，所有一般親衛隊均深信，希特勒必定服毒而死，蓋渠於生前曾立誓，寧可服毒而死，不爲蘇軍所擄，當時希特勒與勃朗女士之屍體靜　於四週沉寂之中，亦無　禮，亦未送喪，及至該日夜，親衛隊均聚集於隊長克洛克斯之一旁，聽渠沉痛之宣詞，略謂：我德國將官中無人悲痛元首之殉國，實爲大憾事，余能親眼目睹元首之遺容，亦足驕傲。</p>
<h3>巴本自殺</h3>
<p>里斯本二十一日中央社電　據美軍前綫本部之消息稱，前德駐士大使巴本，業於捷克國境地帶之收容所內自殺。</p>
<h3>英海軍部發表　掃海艇損失</h3>
<p>瑞典京城二十一日中央社電據倫敦電，英海軍部十入日發表，自開戰以來，英海軍掃海艇一千五三十三艘中，業已喪失二百六十三艘，且此外並有七十八艘受重創。</p>
<h3>艾森霍華談話</h3>
<p>員斯本二十一日中央社電據紐約來電，侵攻歐洲反軸心軍總司令官艾森霍華，十九日由華盛頓循空路抵達紐約。</p>
<p>里斯本二十一日中央社電華盛頓來電，目下歸國之歐洲遠征軍總司令官艾森霍華，十九日會見新聞記者時，說明須澈底破毀德軍實力，談話如次：吾人須澈底破毀舊德軍參謀部，因自一七○六年起，德軍參謀部曾　意支配歐洲，故爲應付將來和平計，必須使德軍關係者互相隔離，使彼等不能合作，並須澈底使德軍幕機構消滅。</p>

<h3>江陰今日</h3>
<p>— 藍或</p>
<p>現有人口</p>
<p>成爲長江要塞的—江陰，濱大江南岸，北興靖江遙遙相對，東磷常熟，西連武進，南接無錫，城北有黃山，鵝嘴鼻，小角山，陸立江岸，勢極險峻。全縣面積計三千六百平方里，現有人口七十九萬七千四百餘名。</p>
<p>在明時，江陰稱爲「連洋州」，明以前，數經興革，名稱亦異，至洪武二年，方改江陰州爲縣。當地人民性情比較强悍，風俗尚稱撲實，宗教的信仰以佛教爲多。</p>
<p>鄰縣交通</p>
<p>由無錫至江陰，搭錫澄長途汽車，每日兩班，約二小時半可以抵達。除公共汽車之外，尚有聯合車行的小汽車，優格比較高，但不限定時間。江陰至常熟，趁內河倫船，惟最近鄕區鬧大刀隊，間或有游擊隊出沒，故　不多都由無錫繞道，趁火車至蘇，再出　搭長途汽車至處。江陰至武進間，有公路可通。</p>

<p>由於地處偏僻，交通不便，事變以來，商業異常蕭條。熱鬧的街市·僅城北及西大街，但比起上海來，還抵不上梵皇渡以西的小市鎭。那裏沒有大店，能够有雙開問門面，兩三隻橱窗，放一些日用品，已經是很像樣了。一方面是物價高漲，人民購買力薄弱，一方面據說那裏商民的負担特大，有什麽軍警供應費，並且細目繁多，合起來數目很是可觀，因此資本較大的商民，鑒於開門無利可獲，關門早夜猛漲，都不願意將貨應市。。見當地所　縣政概沉，提到商業近情，內有一節：「本縣商業近受物價高漲影響，各業異常蕭條，縣商會自三月十五日召開會員大會，改選現監事理事長，當選人章滌樓，辭不就職，兩月以來，負責無人，現縣府令飭負責人，尚在辦理中，」在各大都市，對被選爲理事長，引爲榮事，有拿金錢活動者，而在該縣，當選竟反辭去，此中實沉，可見一斑。</p>
<p>現鈔恐慌</p>
<p>工業方面，有大型紗廠一家，小型紗廠五家，年可產棉紗三千餘件，棉布以土布出產爲昨多，每年約可出四十萬疋，運銷隣縣，其他手工業之設施，尚屬寥寥。金融業因商業影響，故不甚發達，現有銀行四家，錢莊七家，近來也發生現鈔恐慌，週轉不靈，籌碼供不　求，呈不安現象。</p>
<p>勸民完糧</p>
<p>全縣農田計有一百十入萬八千三百三十餘畝，三，四，五，七區爲產米區，六區以棉及豆爲大宗，一，八區兼而有之，年可產米一百零二萬四千一百餘石，麥與棉亦相常可觀·水利通暢，南接太湖，北繞長江，幹流有運河，應天河等，港汶縱橫，灌溉尚得天然利便。惜以去年秋蝗爲災，農物歉收，因之徵收田賦，也受影　，時至今日，已收到半數，現當地縣府，積極勸民完納糧賦，散發告糧戶書，及張貼完賦官傳標語，自七月一日起，以每月二十日米價作標準，加徽遲納罰金，七月二成，八月四成，九月六成，十月八成。十一月一倍，譽如六月二十日，米價是二十萬元，則七月份去完糧，加上滯納罰金二成，須二十四萬元。</p>
<p>教員怠教</p>
<p>學產在江陰相當富裕，有房地產·漕田，沙田等項，但教育的設備，並不良好，而且敎職員的待退，也比他地爲低。不久之前，曾有怠敎情事。一個中學教員，月薪四五千元，加上戰時生活津貼，不過一萬之數，以言小學教員，當然更是可憐，雖然另有作米三斗，可是巳有五個月沒有發放了，而且那戰時生活津貼，也並不按月發給，自意教情事發生之後，聽設巳有一些消息，那消息是所欠的俸米，以二萬元一石折價計算，合計每人可得三萬元正，江陰現在的米價是四十多萬元，然而那五個月所折的錢，—三萬元，到現在還沒有領到。按全縣計有縣立中學一所，私立中學九所，公私立小學（連各鄕鎭）八十餘所，全縣教職員，中小學校，合計在九百人以上。</p>
<p>茲善事業</p>
<p>衛生設施，格於經費，現能敵到的，僅注射防疫及播種牛痘等工作。城區現有私人診所四處，私立醫院七所，公立一所，開業醫十二人，內合格登記奢四人。慈善事業，比較有成績的，計普濟堂及育嬰孤兒所，孤見所現收養男女嬰見一○五名，普濟　收養孤兒老弱男婦，三所共有三十餘人。</p>
<p>先天道案</p>
<p>先天道在讀縣會　狂一時，嗣經所謂「金光法」姜明波等數人，在無錫當衆試驗無效後，農民已大都覺　，雖然現下尚未完全平　，但亦不復有前時的猖獗。先天道在該縣的產生，是來自無錫三·四兩區，由於農民智識之淺薄，受愚者甚衆，所以蔓延極速，久即普及各區，會徒之數，達二萬餘人。彼等所張的目標，是不完糧賦，抗拒不法軍警，打倒地痞流氓，稅吏。自他們勢力膨脹後，不幸的事件迭有發生，最慘的是周莊事件，有巡警五十餘名，慘遭格殺，其中有四名警長身份，並梟首示衆。</p>
<p>園林勝地</p>
<p>近來煤斤缺乏，城區已有二月沒有電燈，一過晚夜，商號打烊，景　並發顯得冷落。娛樂方面，只有一家彈詞聊資點綴。風景最好的是　山，離城六里，惟該山現爲軍事耍塞，　禁止遊人上山。在城內有一個公園，範聞相當大，山坡人滿是高大的樹本，在林子　可以聽到谷鳥的鳴聲，置身其間，幽靜愉快，另有一種天然的風味。</p>

<h3>各慈善團體　實施強制疏散　疏散會決定先從婦孺團體著手</h3>
<p>本市人口疏散委員會，積極進行疏散工作至今，對於唯一交通工具之舟車業已辦妥。該會爲加强工作，並迅速推進疏散人口起見，特於昨日下午三時在市府二樓舉行各組二次聯席會議，四時繼續召集全市各慈善團體代表會議，決定除市民欲離滬歸鄉各自願疏散者外，進一步對慈善團體實施强制疏散，並決定七月一日起實行。兩次會議情形如次：</p>
<h3>各組二次聯絡會議</h3>
<p>疏散委員會各組二次聯席會議，出席者有市福利局及該會總務，調査設計，迎絡，執行四組，與航陸路兩委員工作人員曹今港·陳彬龢·項康原·顧繼武·周毓英，黃敬齋·凌大　等二十餘人。開會後，由陳彬龢主席，首先說明該會自成立以來，假申報社辦公之一部份情形，對疏散工作中之接洽與租用舟車之經過其詳。</p>
<p>議決要案</p>
<p>報告畢，開　討論，即席決議議案多件，擇要錄下：</p>
<p>關於各慈善團體之疏散案，決議自本年七月一日起，開始實行强制疏散，先從其中婦孺團體著手，但疏散時，其出發之先後程序，則由慈善團自行決定。凡被疏散者至目的地後之經常費用，由上海社會公益團體負責統　撥給。</p>
<p>關於疏散擊北旅滬市民案，決議從速與華中鐵道公司聯絡洽商，指定車輛，凡南京以上與華北各地市民需要離滬者，得按照定　向本會執行</p>
<h3>慈善團體代表會議</h3>
<p>疏散委會各組二次會議告畢後，繼續召開本市各慈善團體會議，到有市社會福利局局長周毓英·疏散委會曹今港（劉翰　代）·陳彬龢·項康原·　繼武·黃敬　·凌大珽及各善團方面中國救濟會·峻化聚善堂·上海福幼院·上海濟良所·上海慈聯救災會·新聞報社會服務部·殘廢養老堂·愛育堂·太平寺·救世軍·蘇北孤老院·仁慈善會·上海難童教義院·上海慈善團·平江兒童教養院代表等五十餘人。由周局長毓英王席，首由周氏說明疏散慈善團體決採取强制疏散之意義。繼則由顧繼武陳彬龢致詞，次爲項康原對疏散目的地西山之組申請登記，或由各同鄉會自辦登記後，轉呈執行組辦理發給疏散移動手續。</p>
<p>會議至四時許完畢，聞疏散委會日內將召集筆北等地人民旅滬各同鄕會，開始初步工作。</p>
<p>親察報告。至五時許始散會。茲將各演詞及報告錄左；</p>
<p>周局長詞</p>
<p>疏散會委員周社會福利局長致詞云：「查本會奉上海特別市政府令，辦理本市人口疏散事宜以來，已有三月餘，至今對於疏散上一切條件，如舟車等問題，都已解決，正式進行疏散。表疏散人口，乃爲政府一種適應戰時體制之政策，疏散如能成功，可以減少政府困難，在這戰時疏散，更可以減少人口因空襲而犧牲。况且現在本市米糧昂貴，疏散人口，更可以使本市減少消費。所以根據以上種種，疏散本市人口，實在巳是勢在必行，今日本會召集各慈善團體，就是準備强制疏散，首先疏散婦孺團體，因婦女兒團體，今實在不必要再逗留上海，忍受敵機空襲之威脅與生活高壓下之痛苦。」</p>
<p>顧處長詞</p>
<p>疏散委會就行組主任顧保甲處長致詞云：「方才周局長對於疏散本市各慈善團體的意思，已經說過，本人茲再補充數點。査關於疏散本市人口之步驟，常從不必要留居於本市的人口首先着手，然後逐步展開。査凡屬慈善團體，當此戰時都是不必要留在上海的，所以本會定下月一日起，先從慈善團中婦孺團體先實行强制疏散，目的地已定為江蘇洞庭西山。」</p>
<p>陳彬　詞調查設計組主任陳彬　致詞云：「慈善團體的疏散是必要的，目前更非强制不可的。現在本會對交通工具之籌備，告一段落，萬萬不能再延遲下去，如空襲危險，糧價暴漲，都是早日疏散爲上策。關於疏散經費與疏散後費用，均有統　計劃。査各慈善機關的經費，向來得諸本市社會上公益團體或私人負擔的，將來疏散後，一切費用，均應繼續。今實行强制後，倘有慈善體仍不遵辦，其將來費用，則社會上亦將不再擔負。且我們在疏散目的地有生產計劃，現在請一度實地視察歸來的項康原先生報告西山情形。」</p>
<p>項康原詞</p>
<p>連絡組主任項康原報告：「於西山情形，簡單的可以報告：土地肥沃，空地很多，湖永很淺。普通說來，西山可種的田祗有八千畝，每年收入只够完稅，其實好田何止三四萬畝，因居民不種而不够。常地客民種麥量每年約可得一萬五千石，自用一萬石，以五千石出口，糧食足以自給。現在慈善團體疏散前往，如果耕種稻田，半年以後，就可自給。當地除日用品須外埠運入外，其他一切肉類蔬菜，至少較滬爲賤。且魚產特多，蘆柴遍地，空　寺院，別野祠堂，均可借住。總之，西山只要有人去開發，其前途發展無可限量。西山實在是一個好地方，望慈善團體從速遷往。」</p>
<h3>商號代徵特稅　遵章填用發票　違者財局查出處罰</h3>
<p>市財政局前制定各商號代徵消費特稅塡用發票規則，於本年四月十四日公布週知，幷經刋登各報，查該規則內所定，凡各代徵消費特稅之商號（旅餐館等一體適用）應一律購領塡用，如向用自備聯號發票者，應呈請財政局許可加蓋局章，又規模特小之零售商確無能力塡用發票者，須先呈請財政局核准免用，財政局得查核其營業收入，以估計方法令其繳稅。以上各規定，如有違反者，得處以五萬元以下之罰金，其情節重大者，幷得處以停止營業或其他處分。公布以來，已閱兩月，近聞各商號對於是項特稅發票，遵章購用者固多，而迄未購領或購領而不遵章塡給納稅人以及向用自備發票而未呈請許可蓋章，又或無能力塡用發票之商店，亦未呈請准予免用，現經財政局派員分頭調査，已查出違章商號多家，業經酌予處罰，其餘正在繼續調查處罰中。</p>
<p>逃避特稅整頓辦法</p>
<p>又財局前以本市旅餐館咖啡館茶室，以及各種娛樂塲所賣茶部份，恒將正價抑低，於正賬之外加收附加費雜費之類，藉以逃避特稅，爲整頓稅收計，經規定數項辦法：　禁止旅餐館收取附加費雜費，否則應一幷列人賬單以內照微特稅，費茶永部分亦同。　代微特稅數額應在發槳上單獨開明，不得與其他小賬等混合。　已經開出之發票，如顧客未取去者，應即銷燬不得重複使用。　小賬不得超過應微特稅數額，即本超過正賬百分之二十。　違背上開規定辦法者，應即處罰。業於本年五月二十八日布告週知，幷刊登本市各報，現財政局正在派人密査，各旅館菜館等是否遵行，甚望各商號及筵席旅館等之經營者，對於上述辦法，密切注意　，免受嚴厲處分。</p>
<p>限領照處罰辦法</p>
<p>市財政局營業執照逾限換照處罰暫行規則，業經呈奉市府核准公布實施，惟因該局開徵本年春夏兩季營業執照費時問較遲，爲體恤商艱起見，故予變通辦理，不論月照季照半年照換照期限，一律展限至六月底爲止，如逾期不繳者，照章概須處以應納每期執照費百分之五十之罰金。現距六月底爲日無多，本市各商民，應速遵限前往繳費換照，以免受罰。</p>
<h3>第二期金證劵　今起兌現</h3>
<p>中央儲備銀行於本年五月二十一日至二十三日發行之第二期金證券，現已屆一月期滿，定今（廿二）日起開始兌付黃金，爲維持兌付秩序，以免擁擠起見，特排定兌付號數，計一兩券六月廿二日，由一一○八至一六○○號，廿三日由一六○一至二○五二號，五兩券廿二日，由五○五五三至五○六四四號，十兩券六月廿二日，由一○一○一○至一○一五一○號，廿三日由一○一五一一至一○二○一○號，廿五日由一○二○一一至一○二五三三號，倘特券人因事不能按照規定日期兌取者，廿五日以後，仍得隨時兌領，並無限期。</p>
<p>財局開徵黃金特稅</p>
<p>財政局為充裕市庫開微黃金特現，已薄組代征黃金特稅委員會，派孫曜東·楊季堂·王伯元·沈長　·謝秉泉·潘炳臣。康學源。張園柏。陳愷等爲該會委員，並指定孫曜東爲主任委員，即日成立開始籌備代微事宜。</p>
<h3>警局配發　平價雜糧</h3>
<p>市警察局周兼局長，爲改善員警生活，除調整薪津免費配發食米外，並對各種日用必需品着警察福利社負責採配。茲悉最近採辦得各種雜糧二千餘包，將於今日起平價酊給員警，計每人二十斤，由各處·局·隊·所·院各主管長官負責辦理，向該社繳款領取配發事宜。</p>

<p>本市雜糧業同業公會為繼護本市民食，以七種雜糧呈準當局平價著各會員行號普遍出售，警察局經濟保安科暨經濟警察總隊，爲防止不法雜糧行號，有藉故拒售，或超越平價情事，動員全體經濟警察嚴密調査，如有上項情事，當予罰辦。茲悉前日査有妻定路七○六號七事雜糧號，及淮安路三一三號僑豐雜糧號，於出售赤豆時，平價為每斤二千三百元，而前者以四千元，後者以三千二百元黑市出售，查有實據，當召店主練元卿，張子甫到局依法罰辦，同時繼續派員調查，如有貨拒售者，則予沒收並望市民檢舉。</p>
<p>貼水罪犯依法嚴辦</p>

<h3>佛教名流舉辦　放生事業</h3>

<h3>Fierce Fighting Continues on Yae Take; Bitter Fighting in the Ozato Area; Japanese Air Force Repeatedly Attacks Enemy Fleet</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency dispatch) – In the southern part of Okinawa Island, fierce fighting has continued along the entire front since the 17th. As of the 20th, the intensity of the fighting had not diminished. Especially in the Yaese-dake area in the central part of the battle line, enemy forces launched a fierce attack on Japanese positions. Japanese forces counterattacked fiercely, and fierce fighting is currently underway.</p>
<p>Ryukyu Islands Base, 21st (Central News Agency dispatch) – Enemy forces in the southern end of Okinawa Island are gradually infiltrating the Japanese positions south of Yae Take from the east coastline.

<h3>Soviet Sailors Rescued Express Gratitude for Japanese Hospitality</h3>
<p>Sapporo, 21st (Central News Agency dispatch) – On the 13th of this month, the Soviet freighter "Transbalt" (10,000 tons) was attacked by a U.S. submarine near Sakhalin while returning to Vladivostok. Ninety-four crew members were rescued by the Japanese navy and accommodated in a hotel in Honto-cho on the west coast of Sakhalin. The crew members were extremely grateful for the rescue. When the rescued survivors arrived in Honto-cho, still in the evening light, they embraced each other with extreme excitement. Of the 94 rescued crew members, five are still missing and presumed dead. Among the rescued, there were five female crew members. None of them were injured and all are in good health. They are residing in a local hotel and are very grateful for the protection provided by the Japanese side. When local reporters visited, they repeatedly expressed their gratitude. Captain Gabalilov, representing the entire crew, told reporters: "Since our rescue, we have received the utmost hospitality from Japanese officials. We can only express our gratitude."</p>
<h3>Chongqing Army's General Counteroffensive Still in Preparation</h3>
<p>Central News Agency report – Chongqing military authorities have recently claimed that the situation for a general counteroffensive has reached a certain stage and stated that a general counteroffensive has been launched on the entire front. However, the actual military situation of the Chongqing army has not improved as much as Chongqing had anticipated. Judged from an objective perspective, it has not yet emerged from the stage of a local counteroffensive. In recent days, Chongqing has been reorganizing its military arrangements in various aspects. However, its troop deployment still places the Central clique's direct line troops in Kunming, Chongqing, and the Shaanxi area surrounded by the CCP. Previously, only miscellaneous troops or peripheral troops were dispatched. However, the war zone south of the Yangtze River facing the Japanese army has undergone a change in the division of war zones, and the General Headquarters of the Chinese Army was established, with He Yingqin as the Commander-in-Chief. The Hunan, Guizhou, and Yunnan regions under its command were divided into four army groups, incorporating and reorganizing the remnants of the Hunan and Guangxi campaigns from last year to this spring. In addition, they are looking forward to using the Stilwell Road for supplies and are eager for American-style equipment. It is said that military arrangements for more than ten divisions have been completed, which is the general counteroffensive boasted by Chongqing. However, the Japanese army suddenly launched offensive operations in northern Henan and southern Jiangxi, causing the Chongqing field armies in those two regions to suffer heavy blows. In northern Henan, the Japanese army is around Xushi, and in southern Jiangxi, they are deep in the Longnan, Dingnan, and Qiannan, the so-called "Three Southern Regions." After several days of fighting, they have been completely captured. Although it is unknown how the Japanese army will advance in these two regions in the future, the Japanese army's preemptive offensive has achieved its purpose. From this operation, it can also be seen that Chongqing's general counteroffensive posture is extremely fragile and still in its initial stage. According to the American famous military commentator Swinger in a recently published magazine, "Chongqing's military operations have not yet reached the stage of a counteroffensive." Moreover, Chongqing's deployment of the Central clique's direct line troops in the rear is to avoid direct and strong pressure from the Japanese army, and the dispatch of miscellaneous troops and peripheral troops to the front lines is an attempt to eliminate them naturally. This intention is not difficult to imagine. Currently, Chongqing is striving to strengthen its combat readiness for a counteroffensive, which cannot be denied. However, the military activities on each front today are still limited to local actions.</p>
<h3>Chief of Military Police Chen Visits Wuhu</h3>
<p>Wuhu, 21st (Central News Agency dispatch) – Chen [name missing], Chief of the Central Military Police, arrived in Wuhu by car from Nanjing in recent days to inspect the duties of the military police stationed in Wuhu and the general military and political situation in the area. After arriving, he immediately went to the headquarters of the military police corps for inspection and gave instructions to the officers and soldiers under his command. He then met with reporters and gave a speech outlining the purpose of his trip.</p>
<h3>Nanjing Attacked by Air Yesterday</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 21st (Central News Agency dispatch) – At 2:05 AM and 4:17 AM on the 21st, an enemy aircraft twice intruded into the airspace over Nanjing. Under the intense anti-aircraft fire from the ground, it hastily fled to the southeast.</p>
<h3>Increased Production of Native Cloth in Various Regions; Shipped to Shanghai for Sale</h3>
<p>After the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth, various regions, considering clothing as essential, have successively developed the handicraft industry of spinning native yarn and weaving native cloth to achieve self-sufficiency. The surplus production is also supplied to the market. According to industrial sources, the cloth woven by factories in Shanghai is becoming increasingly expensive due to the high cost of raw materials. The purchasing power of the citizens is very weak. Therefore, in recent times, merchants from various regions have gradually improved the wooden looms for making native yarn and native cloth products. The spinning, weaving, dyeing, and finishing have also improved slightly compared to before. The designs, colors, and quality are gradually becoming excellent, and the production volume is increasing frequently. They are shipping these products to Shanghai in large quantities to be sold separately in the market. Because of the low price, citizens are mostly purchasing them for clothing. The breadth of sales has broken previous records. It is also learned that the native cloth manufacturing industry in various regions is booming, and the amount of dyes shipped from Shanghai to other places is increasing daily.</p>
<p>Nenendo Hirokichi Appointed Counselor to China</p>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency dispatch) – Nenendo Hirokichi, Chief of the Accounting Section of the Minister's Secretariat of the Greater East Asia Ministry, has been transferred to the position of Counselor to the Embassy of the Republic of China and was officially appointed on the 20th.</p>
<p>Shandong Abolishes Four County Governments</p>
<p>Jinan, 21st (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Shandong Provincial Government has abolished the county governments of Linqu, Rizhao, Zhucheng, and Juxian and replaced them with offices to save expenses. The position of director of the offices is currently being assessed by Governor Yang and will be announced soon.</p>
<p>U.S. Army Air Conference Held in Washington</p>
<p>Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a Washington dispatch, Major General LeMay, commander of the U.S. 21st Bomber Squadron at the Mariana base, returned to Washington from Hawaii on the 17th aboard a B-29 aircraft to attend the Army Air Headquarters conference recently held in Washington.</p>
<h3>The Enemy's U.S. Strategy Fails in Okinawa Operation; Military Commentator Discusses the International Situation</h3>
<p>A certain military commentator recently made the following remarks regarding the Okinawa battle situation and the international situation:</p>
<p>Enemy's Military Strategy Fails in Okinawa</p>
<p>The enemy air force attacking Okinawa has very few aircraft and shows no activity. The Japanese special attack force continues its fierce attacks on enemy warships, cruisers, and destroyers escorting ground troops concentrated from the southern region. The Japanese army has obtained a strong southern air base and continues its fierce and strong battles. Regarding the enemy's strategic failure in Okinawa, enemy military commentator Hanson Baldwin severely criticized it, and Laurence also criticized Nimitz. Since the battles of Makiminato, Kadena, and Gushikawa began, it has been three months. Now, reaching the Makabe Line, it is fourteen kilometers north to south, with a daily advance of only 175 meters. From the capture of Makiminato through Kadena to [Mak]abe, it is seven kilometers, with an enemy force of 80,000 (all six divisions).</p>
<p>Buckner Discusses Operational Difficulties</p>
<p>Before Lieutenant General Buckner died, he met with reporters at headquarters and criticized the difficulties in the Okinawa Island operation, saying: "The Japanese defense line in the Shuri area is the strongest stronghold the U.S. military has encountered in the Pacific, second only to Iwo Jima. The U.S. military is also facing difficulties due to heavy rain, which makes it difficult for mechanical units to maneuver, and is engaged in a bitter struggle." The U.S. military used coral reefs and initial offensive-defensive tactics on the southern coast of Okinawa Island, so there were fewer landing operations on Okinawa Island to maintain a mechanically advantageous position, thus concentrating on one battle line. The enemy initially attempted to land at Minatogawa in southern Okinawa, but failed several times. Later, the 1st and 6th Marine Regiments were ineffective, so they joined the army units going south. Therefore, American commentators have harshly criticized this operation: The U.S. military's failure is due to concentrating its forces on one battle line.</p>
<p>Enemy/U.S. Losses are Doubled</p>
<p>The Japanese army in Shuri inflicted considerable losses on the enemy. The main reason is that Lieutenant General Buckner told reporters: "If the U.S. military could use all landing forces on Okinawa Island, the navy and roads for landing would be extremely crowded. At the same time, because the number of troops would be doubled, the U.S. military could constantly pressure the Japanese army. As a result, the losses suffered by the U.S. military would also be doubled." The U.S. military's failure is because it used a one-sided attack, which caused the ground troops to suffer 80,000 casualties over a long period of ten days. The British and American mechanical units were exposed to Japanese special attack units all day long and were subjected to fierce attacks. Therefore, Hanson Baldwin criticizes that the enemy's losses are estimated to be at least 340,000 or more. Laurence's criticism is also very appropriate. On other Pacific battle lines, such as Luzon, Borneo, and New Guinea, the Japanese army is still engaged in fierce battles and inflicting considerable losses on the enemy.</p>
<p>Harvest of San Francisco Conference</p>
<p>Internationally, the San Francisco Conference, which began on April 25th and lasted for two months, created a legalistic world security organization and closed on June 23rd. Before the conference, it was promoted with all possible means, but the result was only a treaty. Its value in the world remains to be proven by history. According to recent San Francisco broadcasts, there is agreement on the trusteeship system, the declaration of the purpose of dependent peoples, and the objectives and concepts of the United Nations in and out of the scope of trusteeship. After the First World War, the issue of trusteeship also became a problem. Even if the conference comes to an end, whether it can actually be resolved remains a question. According to a Reuters dispatch from Washington on the 19th, Truman traveled by plane from Washington to the West Coast on the 19th to attend the closing of the San Francisco Conference on the 23rd, but it is rumored that the conference will be postponed again. Song Ziwen, who participated in the conference on behalf of Chongqing, returned to Chongqing by special plane on the morning of the 20th with 13 staff members, including Jiang Menglin.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the U.S. Ambassador to Chongqing, Hurley, and the Supreme Commander, Wedemeyer, jointly declared: "The rumors that we and our colleagues have conflicting opinions in both public and private matters are completely unfounded. Although our opinions may differ, they can always be resolved satisfactorily. U.S. diplomatic personnel and military representatives in Chongqing currently have no differences of opinion and are working hard, and we expect this to continue in the future." From this statement, we can see their animosity. According to a United Press dispatch on the 20th, the Soviet Union broadcasted on the 20th, slandering the Chongqing Kuomintang's undemocratic dictatorship.</p>
<p>Soviet Trends Deserve Attention</p>
<p>Looking ahead to the world, the San Francisco Conference, which was widely publicized, has come to an end. The issues of Poland and Central Asia and Lebanon have also ended. However, this is only a temporary end and cannot be said to be a real solution. The future direction of the Soviet Union deserves considerable attention in the world situation. The Three Great Powers will meet sometime in early July after Churchill's defeat at the polls, near Berlin. What attitude Stalin will take at that time is a matter of great interest.</p>
<p>U.S. Military Has No Practical Action</p>
<p>On the one hand, the Pacific Theater is suffering from the failure of the U.S. military in Okinawa, and the morale of the U.S. military is low. The fighting spirit against Japan is only verbal and there is no practical action. Admiral Nimitz organization of the Western Pacific Rear Area Command for future war against Japan, the command is given to Lieutenant General Williams Tyree, in preparations for war, transport, supplies, construction, and health preparations. This indicates that the U.S. military is shifting from Nimitz's short-term operational tactics to Admiral Nimitz Mccallum's long-term operational approach. Whether the enemy and the United States can continue [the war for many] years remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Watching the Trends of the Mainland Battlefield</h3>
<p>Since the end of the European war, the enemy has exaggeratedly publicized the plan for a general offensive against Japan with transferred troops. However, in reality, since Germany's surrender on May 8th, almost a month and a half has passed, and the enemy's military actions in East Asia have not undergone any major changes. Even in the Battle of Okinawa Island, the enemy's commander-in-chief was sacrificed, but they still failed to overcome the special attack spirit of the allied nation. Regardless of how the enemy's strategic changes in the future, after this 87th extraordinary session of the Diet, the allied nation has gradually completed the strong defense capability to turn the entire homeland into a battlefield. Therefore, so far, the enemy's strategy of quick decision and quick victory against the Japanese mainland has clearly failed to materialize.</p>
<p>It is difficult to predict the future direction of the enemy's strategic goals. However, there will probably be no decisive action taken before the Three Powers Conference reaches a conclusion. But that is no reason for us to relax our defenses against the enemy. In particular, regarding the mainland China operation, no matter how the international situation may evolve in the future, the enemy's strategy will not change and will only be intensified. At the same time, the two major forces in the Chongqing camp, regardless of whether they will cooperate or fight each other in the future, do not have the awareness to oppose the mainland becoming a battlefield. They all have the intention to use the mainland operation to expand their own power. Therefore, the future of the battlefield in mainland China is worthy of constant vigilance.</p>
<p>Recently, the enemy's attempts to land on the mainland coast at various places guarded by British and Americans, seem to have a gradually improving tendency. At the same time, Chongqing and Yan'an are also rumored to be carrying out so-called "counter-offensive" deployments in various places. From the perspective of the fate of the entire China, this is obviously very unfortunate.</p>
<p>Currently, the Allied forces in China are launching new offensives on various lines in the mainland. In the Central Plains and southeastern regions, they are gaining decisive victories with lightning tactics. In particular, in the Guangdong and Jiangxi regions, they dealt a blow to the main force of the Chongqing army, 60,000 men of the Yu army, who were entrenched in the key areas of South China, and achieved the victory of the Three Souths in Jiangxi. This time, the Allied forces' offensive in mainland China, on the one hand, shattered all the rumors and speculations about the China battlefield in the past one or two months. On the other hand, it also demonstrated the strength of the Allied forces, which is enough to make the Chongqing and Yan'an armies finally consider whether to return to East Asia and jointly defend the East Asia people's East Asia with Japan, or to continue to follow Europe and the United States and plunge the country into a state of crisis. Third, and most importantly, the victory of the Allied forces in Guangdong and Jiangxi provinces has destroyed the Chongqing's counter-offensive posture that was being deployed under the direction of the enemy Americans. Locally, it has created a new defense line around the peace zone, and broadly, it has strengthened the defensive capabilities against the enemy along the Chinese coast. In addition, the recent plan of Chongqing and Yan'an to open up the route for counter-offensive in Central and South China has also been thwarted.</p>
<p>The significance of this victory by the Allied forces has been described above. With the development of the internal and external situations, the importance of the mainland battlefield in the decisive battle of the Greater East Asia War will increase rather than decrease. We should take this battle as a starting point, increase our vigilance, and cooperate more closely to jointly defend China and defend East Asia.</p>
<h3>San Francisco Conference Scheduled to Close Tomorrow; Song Ziwen Returned to Chongqing the Day Before Yesterday</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency dispatch) – The San Francisco Conference, which began on April 25th of this year, will have lasted for nearly two months and is scheduled to conclude on the 23rd of this month. As a result of this conference, the International Security Charter (commonly known as the San Francisco Charter) will be established, which is extremely incompatible with the current world situation. Therefore, it can be said to be repeating the mistakes of the former League of Nations. Although the San Francisco Conference has formally concluded, in reality, major issues that require the actual handling of the International Security Mechanism, such as the Polish issue, the Trieste issue, the Austrian issue, and the handling of the German border issue, have not been discussed. Moreover, the British, American, and Soviet representatives who drafted the new International Security Charter further stated that the reason why the former League of Nations had no military background and therefore had no ability to implement when dealing with international disputes, resulting in failure, was that they stipulated that when a country in dispute refuses the advice of the Security Council, they will jointly initiate military force to resolve the dispute. Moreover, they further stipulated that when military force is initiated, it will be decided by the Security Council, which is dictated by the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Among the five permanent members of the Security Council, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, Chongqing, and France, if a country experiences an international dispute, that country has the right to refuse to initiate military force. When this point was brought up on the conference floor, although it was opposed by Australia and other small and medium-sized countries, it was forcibly passed by the Permanent Council. According to this, the Council has no power to prevent the five major powers from attacking or invading other small countries. Therefore, the San Francisco Conference implemented a regional system, recognizing the right of member countries in each region to conclude regional security treaties. In other words, the United States and the Soviet Union have each established a national security system in their respective hemispheres. The fierce competition between the United States and the Soviet Union has also given rise to other phenomena. We can also get a glimpse of this from the international trust issue discussed on the conference floor in San Francisco. The United States insisted that all regions seized from defeated countries in this war and all territories entrusted to the League of Nations after the last war should be trust territories. When the occupying country administers, the "Trust Committee" appointed by the Dehui shall bear complete responsibility. It also stated that the strategic islands in the Pacific occupied by the United States by military force should not be subject to the supervision of this Trust Committee. The Soviet Union also knew very well that the reason why the United States proposed this plan was to obtain strategic islands in the Pacific in order to prevent Soviet forces from advancing into the Pacific. Therefore, the Soviet representative at the San Francisco Conference suddenly proposed on the floor of the Voting Committee on June 14 that the charter should stipulate "any member country may withdraw from the conference at any time, regardless of the reason," in order to refute the United States, causing the last major turmoil at the San Francisco Conference.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a dispatch from Chongqing, Song Ziwen returned to Chongqing on the 20th from San Francisco.</p>
<h3>Blood Type Identification Tests to Begin in Peiping</h3>
<p>Peiping, 21st (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Special Committee of the Rescue Department of the Peiping Police Defense Corps is preparing for blood transfusions after blood loss during air raids and needs to contact related agencies. As a result, blood serum materials and funds are needed and are being requested. It is planned to conduct blood type identification tests on 10,000 youth corps members in Peiping City for the first time. The date will be implemented after the materials and funds are received.</p>
<h3>U.S. Establishes Supply Command in the Pacific</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a dispatch from Manila, the headquarters of Admiral Nimitz McCalum announced on the 19th that a supply command, commanded by Lieutenant General Spruance, has been established in the Pacific. The new command will be responsible for the transportation of ammunition, equipment, food, and personnel for the general offensive against Japan in the future.</p>
<h3>Wavell Rejects Request from Indian Leaders</h3>
<p>Basbon, 21st (Central News Agency dispatch) – Jinnah, President of the All-India Muslim League, requested Wavell to postpone the Simla Conference, but it was rejected. A dispatch from New Delhi also stated that Gandhi also requested Wavell to postpone the Simla Conference, which was to be held on the 25th, by one week to July 2nd. However, it is rumored that Wavell expressed opposition to this.</p>
<h3>Swiss Commander-in-Chief Kourson Resigns</h3>
<p>Bailen, 21st (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to news received from this question, the Swiss National Army Commander-in-Chief, aged seventy-one, General Kourson, submitted his resignation to the parliament yesterday, because the military service of the Swiss state ended on August 20 of this year.</p>
<h3>Belgium to Implement National Referendum System</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 20th (Central News Agency) – According to a British dispatch received last night from Brussels, the Belgian Communist Party, in opposition to King Leopold's decision to return, is calling on the public to launch a nationwide demonstration movement. A Catholic member of the government led by Achille Van Acker, named Van Cauwelaert, suddenly proposed yesterday the adoption of a "national referendum" system to resolve Belgium's political crisis. Van Cauwelaert is currently the Minister of Justice. His proposal aims to resolve the issue of the King's forced abdication. A right-wing political organ in Brussels commented on Van Cauwelaert's proposal as follows: "The national referendum system is the only genuine way to promote public opinion in the country. However, this system must be gradually implemented under calm, free, and stable control."</p>
<h3>Former Head of French Anti-Communist League Sentenced to Death</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from Paris, the Paris court sentenced Marcel Déat, the head of the anti-Communist league under Laval who had collaborated with the German army, to death in absentia on the morning of the 19th.</p>
<h3>British, American, and Soviet Diplomats Continue Negotiations on Polish Issue</h3>
<p>—Polish Political Leaders Unlikely to Face Death Penalty—</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 21st (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from Moscow, the British Ambassador to Moscow, Kerr, hosted a dinner party at the British Embassy on the night of the 19th, inviting Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Vyshinsky and US Ambassador to Moscow Harriman. They discussed the establishment of a new Polish coalition government. Furthermore, the conference of Polish democratic factions scheduled for the 19th did not take place and is expected to be reconvened soon to discuss specific proposals from various factions. The atmosphere of the conference has gradually eased due to the fact that anti-Soviet elements from the Polish government-in-exile in London have been handed over to military tribunals.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 21st (Central News Agency) – According to a report from Moscow, during the continued trial of sixteen Polish political prisoners in the Moscow court yesterday, Prosecutor General Afanasyev stated that he had no intention of imposing the death penalty on the four major culprits of Poland. However, they should all be sentenced to "lifelong deprivation of freedom." He continued, stating that most Polish people wanted to sow seeds of discord among the United Nations and prevent the people of the Soviet Union and Poland from ever reaching mutual understanding. Although August Emil Fieldorf and many other defendants did not personally kill Soviet generals, they should bear full responsibility for the killings, as they were instigators who issued orders. Evidence of this has been obtained. Although it could be argued that their crimes warrant the death penalty, we are at the stage of victory in the war. Even if they do not die, they cannot harm our strong Soviet Union. Therefore, we do not wish to impose the death penalty on them. The two main culprits among the four Polish culprits are General August Emil Fieldorf, the Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Home Army, and Jan Jankowski, the Acting Prime Minister of the Polish government-in-exile in London and Chairman of the Council of the Polish Underground State. The guilt of the four major culprits has been proven. They were the organizers and leaders of the Polish Underground State's sabotage activities against the Soviet Union. The remaining twelve defendants will be judged as accomplices.</p>
<h3>Conflicts Erupt Again Within Syria</h3>
<p>Casablanca, 21st (Central News Agency) – According to a report from Beirut yesterday, clashes between French and Syrian forces occurred again on Tuesday in the Arab Punar region near the Turkish border in northwestern Syria. It is reported that several units of the French army suddenly attacked the National Army in the area. Conflicts also occurred in the Anfrates region.</p>
<h3>Hitler's Death Reportedly Due to Poisoning; Actress Braun Dies Simultaneously</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 21st (Central News Agency) – According to a report from a Reuters special correspondent, details about the simultaneous deaths of German leader Adolf Hitler and actress Eva Braun in the Berlin Führerbunker were revealed last night by Hitler's SS guard, Kunno, who was detained at the headquarters of the British Second Army in Germany. Kunno stated: "I arrived at Berchtesgaden (Hitler's villa) in mid-February 1945, where I personally saw the bedrooms of Eva Braun and Adolf Hitler. There was a 'connecting door' between the two bedrooms. No one in the villa dared to call Braun 'Miss Braun,' only referring to her by the abbreviation of 'Eva Braun,' 'E.B.' When I returned to Berlin, rumors spread within the SS that Hitler and Miss Braun had married at the end of April. On April 30th, I suddenly met Miss Braun alone in a basement. She looked depressed and said, 'I would rather die here than leave and go elsewhere.' Her voice was very sad. At that time, I could only try to comfort her and call her 'Miss Braun.' Unexpectedly, she urgently said, 'From now on, you should call me Mrs. Hitler.' During the final days of the siege of Berlin, all SS guards in the Führerbunker were ordered to only pass through a tunnel sixty meters deep because the Soviet artillery fire was extremely intense. Hitler slept on a camp bed every night, but from April 18th, he also went to the tunnel and stayed there day and night. On May 1st, when I passed through the tunnel to deliver breakfast, I saw Hitler sitting quietly in a rocking chair, lightly tapping the chair with his left fingers, showing signs of nervousness. At that moment, Captain Manguha entered. Hitler immediately stood up and shook hands with him, repeatedly asking 'What's the news?' This was the last time I heard Hitler speak. At around 5 PM on the same day, while passing through the tunnel, the tunnel was empty. Looking around, I saw two of Hitler's personal staff, including Schaar. One of them looked very resentful. Seeing me, he couldn't help but shout, 'The Führer is dead and burned to death!' I turned back to the tunnel and found the bodies of Hitler and Miss Braun lying on the sandy ground about three yards from the fire exit. Hitler was lying face down with his knees slightly bent. Miss Braun was close beside him, face down. Although both bodies were charred by fire, they were still identifiable. Miss Braun's usual summer clothes and black leather shoes and Hitler's khaki military uniform were unmistakable. Four motorcycles were parked near the bodies. Based on my personal observation, Hitler and Miss Braun were poisoned by Professor Stumpfegger, the chief medical officer in the Führerbunker. I suspect they were poisoned by him because I saw him poison Hitler's beloved dog 'Blondi' the night before. At the same time, all the SS guards deeply believed that Hitler must have taken poison, as he had sworn before his death that he would rather die by poison than be captured by the Soviet army. At that time, the bodies of Hitler and Miss Braun lay quietly in the silence, without any ceremonies or funerals. That night, the SS guards gathered beside Captain Crookes, listening to his solemn declaration, which roughly stated: 'It is a great pity that none of the German generals mourned the death of the Führer. I am proud to have witnessed the Führer's last remains with my own eyes.'"</p>

<p>Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from Washington, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the current Supreme Commander of the European Expeditionary Force who has returned home, stated while meeting with reporters on the 19th that the strength of the German military must be completely destroyed. His remarks were as follows: "We must completely destroy the old German General Staff. Because since 1706, the German General Staff has intentionally dominated Europe. Therefore, for the sake of future peace, those related to the German military must be isolated from each other so that they cannot cooperate, and the German military staff system must be completely eliminated."</p>

<h3>Jiangyin Today</h3>
<p>—Lan Huo</p>
<p>Current Population</p>
<p>Becoming a vital Yangtze River fortress, Jiangyin is located on the south bank of the Yangtze River, facing Jingjiang to the north, bordering Changshu to the east, Wujin to the west, and Wuxi to the south. To the north of the city are Huangshan, E'zuibi, and Xiaojiaoshan mountains, standing on the riverbank, forming a very strategic terrain. The county covers an area of 3,600 square li and has a current population of over 797,400.</p>
<p>During the Ming Dynasty, Jiangyin was called "Lianyang Prefecture." Before the Ming Dynasty, it underwent several reforms and had different names. It was officially changed from Jiangyin Prefecture to Jiangyin County in the second year of the Hongwu era. The local people are relatively strong-willed, and their customs are still quite simple. The religious faith is mainly Buddhism.</p>
<p>Transportation to Neighboring Counties</p>
<p>From Wuxi to Jiangyin, take the Xicheng long-distance bus, which runs twice daily and takes about two and a half hours to arrive. In addition to public buses, there are also private cars from United Motor Transport, which are more expensive but do not have fixed schedules. To get from Jiangyin to Changshu, take an inland river steamboat. However, due to recent activity by the "Big Knife Society" in the rural areas and the occasional presence of guerrillas, most people detour through Wuxi, take a train to Suzhou, and then take a long-distance bus to their destination. There is a road connecting Jiangyin and Wujin.</p>
<p>Burden on Merchants and Residents</p>
<p>Due to its remote location and inconvenient transportation, commerce has been exceptionally depressed since the war. The bustling streets are only in the northern and western parts of the city, but even these are not as good as the small towns west of the Fanhangdu area in Shanghai. There are no large stores there. Having a double-door storefront with two or three display windows to sell some daily necessities is considered quite impressive. On the one hand, prices are high and the people's purchasing power is weak. On the other hand, it is said that the burden on merchants and residents there is particularly heavy, with various military and police supply fees and many detailed items, adding up to a considerable amount. Therefore, merchants with larger capital, seeing no profit in opening their doors and prices rising sharply day and night, are unwilling to put their goods on the market. The "Jiangyin County Administrative Overview" mentions the recent situation of commerce, including a section stating: "The county's commerce has recently been affected by rising prices, and all industries are exceptionally depressed. The County Chamber of Commerce convened a membership meeting on March 15 to re-elect the current supervisors, directors, and chairman. The elected chairman, Zhang Dilou, declined the position. For two months, no one has been responsible. The County Government has ordered the person in charge to be dealt with, but it is still in progress." In major cities, being elected as chairman is considered an honor, and some even spend money to campaign for it. However, in Jiangyin County, the elected person actually declines the position, which shows the reality of the situation.</p>
<p>Currency Panic</p>
<p>In terms of industry, there is one large-scale yarn factory and five small-scale yarn factories, which can produce 3,000 pieces of cotton yarn annually. Cotton cloth production is mainly local cloth, with an annual output of approximately 400,000 bolts, which are sold to neighboring counties. Other handicraft facilities are still scarce. The financial industry is not very developed due to the impact of commerce. There are currently four banks and seven money shops. Recently, there has also been a currency panic, with tight cash flow, insufficient funds, and an unstable situation.</p>
<p>Urging People to Pay Grain</p>
<p>The county has a total of 1,183,300 mu of farmland. Districts 3, 4, 5, and 7 are rice-producing areas, District 6 mainly produces cotton and beans, and Districts 1 and 8 have both. The annual rice production is over 1,024,100 shi. Wheat and cotton production are also considerable. The irrigation system is smooth, with Taihu Lake to the south, the Yangtze River to the north, and the Grand Canal and Yingtian River as main waterways. The crisscrossing harbors and rivers provide natural convenience for irrigation. However, due to a locust plague last autumn, the harvest was poor, which has affected the collection of land taxes. To date, only half has been collected. The local county government is actively urging people to pay their grain taxes, distributing notices to grain households, and posting slogans promoting tax payment. Starting from July 1, a late payment penalty will be added based on the average rice price of each month, with a 20% increase in July, 40% in August, 60% in September, 80% in October, and 100% in November. For example, if the rice price on June 20 is 200,000 yuan, then completing the grain payment in July, plus the 20% late payment penalty, will require 240,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Teachers' Strikes</p>
<p>The educational assets in Jiangyin are quite abundant, including real estate, grain fields, and sand fields. However, the educational facilities are not good, and the treatment of teachers is lower than in other places. Not long ago, there was a teachers' strike. A middle school teacher's monthly salary is 4,000 to 5,000 yuan, plus a wartime living allowance, totaling only about 10,000 yuan. Primary school teachers are, of course, even more pitiful. Although they also receive three dou of rice, it has not been distributed for five months. Moreover, the wartime living allowance is not paid monthly. Since the teachers' strike, there has been some news that the owed rice will be calculated at a discounted price of 20,000 yuan per shi, totaling 30,000 yuan per person. The current rice price in Jiangyin is over 400,000 yuan, but the 30,000 yuan converted from the five months' worth of rice has not yet been received. There is one county-run middle school, nine private middle schools, and over eighty public and private primary schools (including those in various townships), with a total of over 900 teachers and staff in the county's middle and primary schools.</p>
<p>Charitable Undertakings</p>
<p>Due to limited funds, the health facilities currently available are only epidemic prevention injections and smallpox vaccinations. The urban area currently has four private clinics, seven private hospitals, and one public hospital, with twelve practicing doctors, including four qualified and registered doctors. The more successful charitable undertakings include the Pujitang and the Infant and Orphanage. The orphanage currently houses 105 boys and girls, while the Pujitang houses a total of over 30 elderly, weak, and orphaned men and women.</p>
<p>The Native Religion Case</p>
<p>The Native Religion was rampant in the county for a while. After several people, including Jiang Mingbo of the so-called "Golden Light Method," publicly failed in their experiments in Wuxi, most farmers have awakened. Although it has not been completely quelled, it is no longer as rampant as before. The Native Religion in the county originated from districts 3 and 4 of Wuxi. Due to the farmers' ignorance, many were deceived, so it spread rapidly and soon became widespread in various districts, with over 20,000 members. Their stated goals were to refuse to pay grain taxes, resist illegal military and police, and overthrow local bullies, rascals, and tax collectors. After their power expanded, unfortunate incidents occurred repeatedly. The most tragic was the Zhouzhuang incident, in which over 50 patrol officers were brutally killed, including four police chiefs, who were beheaded and their heads displayed to the public.</p>
<p>Gardens and Scenic Spots</p>
<p>Recently, coal has been scarce, and the urban area has been without electric lights for two months. After nightfall, the shops close, and the scenery appears desolate. For entertainment, there is only one storytelling performance to add some color. The best scenery is at Yushan Mountain, six li from the city. However, the mountain is currently a military fortress, and tourists are prohibited from climbing it. There is a park in the city, with a large area and hillsides full of tall trees. One can hear the singing of valley birds in the forest, and being there is peaceful and enjoyable, with a unique natural flavor.</p>

<h3>Various Charitable Organizations to Implement Forced Evacuation; Evacuation Committee Decides to Start with Women and Children's Groups First</h3>
<p>The city's Population Evacuation Committee has been actively carrying out evacuation work to this day, and arrangements have been made for the only means of transportation, boats and vehicles. In order to strengthen the work and quickly promote the evacuation of the population, the committee held a second joint meeting of various groups on the second floor of the City Hall at 3 PM yesterday and continued to convene a meeting of representatives of various charitable organizations in the city at 4 PM, deciding to implement forced evacuation of charitable organizations in addition to citizens who wish to leave Shanghai and return to their hometowns voluntarily, and decided to implement it from July 1. The circumstances of the two meetings are as follows:</p>
<h3>Second Liaison Meeting of Various Groups</h3>
<p>The second joint meeting of various groups of the Evacuation Committee was attended by the City Welfare Bureau and the committee's general affairs, survey design, liaison, and execution groups, as well as staff members Cao Jingang, Chen Binhe, Xiang Kangyuan, Gu Jiwu, Zhou Yuying, Huang Jingzhai, and Ling Dade from the shipping and land transport committees, totaling over 20 people. After the meeting was convened, Chairman Chen Binhe first explained the situation of the committee's office in the Shen Bao newspaper office since its establishment, detailing the process of contacting and renting boats and vehicles in the evacuation work.</p>
<h3>Resolution of Important Cases</h3>
<p>After the report, discussions were held, and several proposals were resolved on the spot, with the following being selected and recorded:</p>
<p>Regarding the evacuation of various charitable organizations, it was resolved that forced evacuation would be implemented from July 1 of this year, starting with women and children's groups, but the order of departure would be decided by the charitable organizations themselves. The regular expenses of those evacuated to their destination will be uniformly allocated by the Shanghai social welfare organizations.</p>
<p>Regarding the evacuation of citizens from northern provinces living in Shanghai, it was resolved to contact and negotiate with the China Central Railway Company as soon as possible to designate vehicles. Citizens from Nanjing and above and from various parts of North China who need to leave Shanghai can apply to the committee for execution according to the schedule.</p>
<h3>Charity Organization Representatives Meeting</h3>
<p>Following the conclusion of the second meetings of various groups under the Evacuation Committee, a meeting of various charity organizations in the city was convened. In attendance were Director Zhou Yuying of the Municipal Social Welfare Bureau, Cao Jingang of the Evacuation Committee (representing Liu Han), Chen Binhe, Xiang Kangyuan, Gu Jiwu, Huang Jing, Ling Dading, and representatives from various charity organizations, including the China Relief Society, Junhua Jushantang, Shanghai Fuyouyuan, Shanghai Jiliangsuo, Shanghai Cilian Relief Association, the Social Service Department of the Xinwen Bao Newspaper, Canfei Yanglaotang, Ai Yu Tang, Taiping Temple, the Salvation Army, Subei Orphanage, Ren Ci Charity Association, Shanghai Orphanage for Children, Shanghai Charity Group, and the Pingjiang Children's Education Institute, totaling over fifty people. Director Zhou Yuying presided over the meeting. First, Director Zhou explained the significance of the compulsory evacuation of charity organizations. Subsequently, Gu Jiwu and Chen Binhe delivered speeches. Next, Xiang Kangyuan discussed the registration application for Xishan as the evacuation destination, suggesting that various hometown associations could handle the registration themselves and then submit it to the executive group for processing evacuation travel documents.</p>
<p>The meeting concluded around 4 PM. It was reported that the Evacuation Committee would soon convene meetings with various Shanghai-based hometown associations from northern Jiangsu and other areas to begin preliminary work.</p>
<p>Personal inspection report. The meeting adjourned around 5 PM. The speeches and reports are recorded below:</p>
<p>Director Zhou's Speech</p>
<p>Director Zhou of the Social Welfare Bureau, a member of the Evacuation Committee, stated, "Since this committee was ordered by the Shanghai Special Municipal Government to handle the population evacuation of this city, it has been over three months. To date, all conditions for evacuation, such as boats and vehicles, have been resolved, and evacuation is officially underway. Evacuating the population is a policy implemented by the government to adapt to the wartime system. If evacuation is successful, it can reduce the government's difficulties. During wartime evacuation, it can further reduce the number of casualties from air raids. Moreover, the price of rice is currently high in this city. Evacuating the population can further reduce consumption in the city. Therefore, based on the above, evacuating the city's population is imperative. Today, this committee is convening various charity organizations to prepare for compulsory evacuation, starting with women and children groups. There is truly no need for women and children groups to remain in Shanghai, enduring the threat of enemy air raids and the suffering under high living costs."</p>
<p>Director Gu's Speech</p>
<p>Director Gu of the Evacuation Committee's Executive Group stated, "Director Zhou has already explained the meaning of evacuating the city's charity organizations. I will add a few points. The steps for evacuating the city's population will begin with those who do not need to reside in the city, and then gradually expand. All charity organizations are unnecessary to remain in Shanghai during this time of war. Therefore, this committee has decided to begin compulsory evacuation of women and children groups from charity organizations starting from the first day of next month. The destination has been set as Xishan in Dongting, Jiangsu."</p>
<p>Chen Binhe's Speech</p>
<p>Director Chen Binhe of the Investigation and Design Group stated, "The evacuation of charity organizations is necessary, and it is now compulsory. The committee has completed the preparation of transportation, and we can no longer delay. The danger of air raids and the soaring price of food make early evacuation the best course of action. The expenses for evacuation and the costs after evacuation are all unified in the plan. The expenses of various charitable organizations have always been borne by social welfare organizations or individuals in this city. All expenses after evacuation should continue to be covered. If any charitable organization still does not comply after the implementation of compulsion, society will no longer bear its expenses in the future. Moreover, we have a production plan at the evacuation destination. Now, please listen to Mr. Xiang Kangyuan's report on the situation in Xishan, who has returned from an on-site inspection."</p>
<p>Xiang Kangyuan's Speech</p>
<p>Xiang Kangyuan, Director of the Liaison Group, reported: "Regarding the situation in Xishan, I can report simply: the land is fertile, there is a lot of open space, and the lakes are very shallow. Generally speaking, there are only 8,000 mu of arable land in Xishan, and the annual income is only enough to pay taxes. In fact, there are more than 30,000 to 40,000 mu of good land, but the residents do not cultivate enough. Local guest farmers can harvest about 15,000 shi of wheat each year, using 10,000 shi for their own consumption and exporting 5,000 shi, which is enough for self-sufficiency. Now that charity organizations are evacuating there, if they cultivate rice paddies, they can be self-sufficient in half a year. Except for daily necessities that need to be transported from other places, all other meats and vegetables are at least cheaper than in Shanghai. Moreover, there is a lot of fish production, reeds are everywhere, and vacant temples, villas, and ancestral halls can be borrowed for accommodation. In short, Xishan has unlimited development potential as long as people go there to develop it. Xishan is indeed a good place, and I hope that charity organizations will move there as soon as possible."</p>
<h3>Business Firms Collect Special Tax as Agents; Issue Invoices According to Regulations; Violators Will Be Investigated and Penalized by the Finance Bureau</h3>
<p>The Municipal Finance Bureau previously formulated rules for business firms to collect special consumption tax as agents and issue invoices, which were announced on April 14 of this year and published in various newspapers. According to the rules, all business firms collecting special consumption tax as agents (including hotels and restaurants) should uniformly purchase and issue the invoices. If they use self-prepared invoices with serial numbers, they should apply to the Finance Bureau for permission to affix the bureau's seal. Retailers with a very small scale who are truly unable to issue invoices must first apply to the Finance Bureau for approval to be exempted. The Finance Bureau may verify their business income and order them to pay taxes using estimation methods. Violations of the above regulations may be subject to a fine of up to 50,000 yuan. In severe cases, they may also be subject to suspension of business or other penalties. It has been two months since the announcement. It has recently been reported that many business firms are complying with the regulations by purchasing and using the special tax invoices, but some have not yet purchased them or have purchased them but are not issuing them to taxpayers according to regulations. Others are using self-prepared invoices without applying for permission to affix the seal, or they are stores that are unable to issue invoices but have not applied for exemption. The Finance Bureau has dispatched personnel to investigate, and many business firms have been found to be in violation and have been penalized. The investigation and penalties are continuing.</p>
<p>Measures to Rectify Tax Evasion of Special Taxes</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Finance Bureau previously found that hotels, restaurants, cafes, tea rooms, and various entertainment venues in the city were deliberately lowering the price of tea and collecting surcharges and miscellaneous fees outside of the official accounts in order to evade special taxes. To rectify tax collection, several measures have been stipulated: Hotels and restaurants are prohibited from collecting surcharges and miscellaneous fees; otherwise, they should be included in the bill and subject to special tax. The same applies to the tea fee portion. The amount of special tax collected as an agent should be separately stated on the invoice and should not be mixed with other small amounts. Issued invoices should be destroyed immediately if customers do not take them and should not be reused. Small accounts should not exceed the amount of special tax due, that is, not exceed 20% of the official account. Violations of the above regulations will be penalized immediately. This was announced on May 28 of this year and published in various newspapers in the city. The Finance Bureau is currently sending people to secretly investigate whether various hotels and restaurants are complying. It is hoped that business firms and operators of banquets and hotels will pay close attention to the above measures to avoid severe penalties.</p>
<p>Deadline for License Renewal and Penalties</p>
<p>The temporary rules for penalties for overdue renewal of business licenses by the Municipal Finance Bureau have been submitted to the Municipal Government for approval and implementation. However, due to the Finance Bureau's late collection of business license fees for the spring and summer seasons of this year, a flexible approach is being taken to ease the difficulties of businesses. Regardless of whether the license is monthly, quarterly, or semi-annual, the renewal deadline is extended to the end of June. Those who fail to pay by the deadline will be penalized with 50% of the license fee due for each period. There are few days left until the end of June. Business people in the city should quickly pay the fees and renew their licenses before the deadline to avoid penalties.</p>
<h3>Second Phase of Gold Certificates Redeemed Starting Today</h3>
<p>The second phase of gold certificates issued by the Central Reserve Bank from May 21 to 23 of this year has reached its one-month maturity. Gold redemption will begin today (the 22nd). To maintain redemption order and avoid congestion, redemption numbers have been scheduled. For one-tael certificates, redemption will be from numbers 1108 to 1600 on June 22, and from numbers 1601 to 2052 on June 23. For five-tael certificates, redemption will be from numbers 50553 to 50644 on June 22. For ten-tael certificates, redemption will be from numbers 101010 to 101510 on June 22, from numbers 101511 to 102010 on June 23, and from numbers 102011 to 102533 on June 25. If certificate holders cannot redeem on the scheduled dates due to circumstances, they can redeem at any time after June 25 without any time limit.</p>
<p>Finance Bureau Imposes Special Tax on Gold</p>
<p>The Finance Bureau has formed a special tax committee on gold to enrich the municipal treasury by collecting special taxes on gold. Sun Yaodong, Yang Jitang, Wang Boyuan, Shen Chang, Xie Bingquan, Pan Bingchen, Kang Xueyuan, Zhang Yuanbai, and Chen Kai have been appointed as members of the committee, with Sun Yaodong designated as the chairman. The committee will be established immediately to prepare for the collection of special taxes on gold.</p>
<h3>Police Bureau Distributes Affordable Miscellaneous Grains</h3>
<p>Chief Zhou, also the director of the Municipal Police Bureau, is improving the lives of police officers. In addition to adjusting salaries and providing free rice, he has also tasked the Police Welfare Society with purchasing and distributing various daily necessities. It is reported that the recent purchase of more than 2,000 bags of various miscellaneous grains will be sold to police officers at affordable prices starting today. Each person will receive 20 jin, and the responsible officers from various departments, bureaus, teams, stations, and institutes will handle the payment and distribution matters to the society.</p>
<p>Two Miscellaneous Grain Stores Penalized for Raising Prices</p>
<p>The Shanghai Miscellaneous Grain Industry Association, to protect the city's food supply, submitted a plan to the authorities to sell seven types of miscellaneous grains at fair prices through its member stores. The Economic Security Section of the Police Bureau and the Economic Police Corps, to prevent illegal miscellaneous grain stores from refusing to sell or exceeding the fair prices, mobilized the entire economic police force to conduct strict investigations. If such situations were found, penalties would be imposed. It is reported that yesterday, Qishi Miscellaneous Grain Store at 706 Qiding Road and Qiaofeng Miscellaneous Grain Store at 313 Huaian Road were found to be selling red beans at black market prices of 4,000 yuan and 3,200 yuan per jin, respectively, while the fair price was 2,300 yuan per jin. After investigation, the store owners Lian Yuanqing and Zhang Zipu were summoned to the bureau and penalized according to the law. At the same time, personnel are continuing to investigate, and those who refuse to sell goods will have their goods confiscated. Citizens are encouraged to report violations.</p>
<p>Dealing Strictly with Profiteers on Discounted Vouchers</p>
<p>The economic police authorities continue to mobilize and conduct secret investigations into illegal activities such as discounting payment vouchers for high profits. In particular, the First Team of the Economic Police Corps dispatched its entire staff yesterday afternoon to conduct a major secret investigation in the financial district. Dozens of illegal economic criminals have been arrested and detained. They will be charged with disrupting the financial order and will be handed over to the Third Division for transfer to the court for strict punishment according to judicial procedures to curb the bad trend.</p>
<h3>Zhang Dasan Executed by Firing Squad This Morning for Forcibly Extorting Civilian Property; Verdict by Special Court Branch</h3>
<p>To rectify the conduct of civil servants in the city and promote clean politics, the highest government authority has established a branch of the Special Court in the city to punish corrupt officials and illegal merchants in a serious manner. The court received approval from the National Government yesterday (the 21st) for the verdict on the Zhang Dasan case of forcibly extorting civilian property. The main culprit, Zhang Dasan, was sentenced to death and was executed by firing squad at 10:00 AM this morning (the 22nd) at the Guanghua University old site square on Zhongshan Road.

The respective heads will preside over the meetings to report on and review the police situation of the week. They will also hold inspections of internal affairs, firearms, and uniforms according to the police inspection rules issued by the Ministry of Interior. Furthermore, before the collection and dispatch of duties every night, each branch should assign patrol officers to give spiritual speeches, elaborating on the general principles of police service.

<h3>Factories to Complete Registration by Deadline</h3>
<p>The Municipal Economic Bureau has set a deadline of the end of March in the 34th year for unregistered factories to complete their registration.

Newly established factories and businesses should promptly apply for registration in accordance with the Provisional Regulations for the Registration of Managed Factories and the Commercial Registration Rules.</p>
<h3>Edible Oil Association Handles Registration of Incoming Goods</h3>

<p>Social Service: Home Tutors; Training Begins Tomorrow; Several Teachers Have Already Been Hired</p>
<p>To meet the needs of society, the newspaper's Obligatory Education Committee has established a "Home Tutor Training Class." The entrance examination was held on the [blank] day, and 40 out of more than 70 people were admitted, with 14 on the waiting list. The admitted students have mostly received higher education and have many years of experience as teachers in primary and secondary schools. Their knowledge and experience are very good. It is now scheduled to train them for one week starting tomorrow (the 23rd) at the Qunhua Elementary School on West Changxing Road. Education experts will lecture on how to help children prepare for exams, individual teaching methods for each subject, guidance methods for problem children, and other major courses. Once the training is completed, they will be introduced separately to serve as summer home tutors. Several letters have been received from various circles requesting to hire them. The committee will carefully select them to meet the good intentions of enthusiastic people. The committee sincerely welcomes letters or introductions from all walks of life requesting to hire them.</p>

<h3>Buddhist Celebrities Organize Releasing Lives</h3>
<p>Li Sihao, Wen Lantao, Yu Zhijing, Nie Yuntai, Tao Xiquan, Ding Fubao, Li Yuanjing, and other famous Buddhists in Shanghai recently initiated the Yiyou Releasing Lives Association, electing Elder Master Xingci as the president and Fan Gunong and Wu Yunzhai as the vice presidents. Starting from the fifth month of the lunar calendar, one session of releasing lives will be held every month. Each session will begin with Elder Master Xingci leading the congregation in practicing the Dharma at the Fazang Temple, followed by releasing lives. Basic members must commit to at least one vow per month, with each vow being 10,000 yuan. Ordinary members may contribute any amount. The collection point is at the Kongming Electrical Material Store at 359 Guangdong Road, at the intersection of Shandong Road. The purpose is briefly stated as follows: "Do no evil, make abstaining from killing the priority, practice all good deeds, make releasing lives the first priority. Today, with vast tribulations filling the sky and war raging everywhere, to lighten the turbidity of the tribulations, we rely on kindness. We hope all circles will actively participate and widely solicit like-minded people."</p>
<h3>Unable to Endure Economic Pressure, Fishmonger Hangs Himself; Fishmongers' Association Raises Funds for Relief</h3>
<p>The "Li Bao" newspaper reported on the 20th of this month that a fishmonger, unable to endure economic pressure, hanged himself. Upon hearing this news, the Fishmongers' Association immediately sent representatives, and Mr. Chen initiated a fundraising campaign to provide relief to the deceased's family and to find solutions for fishmongers lacking capital. After contacting a small loan department of a certain bank to provide assistance to impoverished fishmongers, those fishmongers who genuinely need loans for their businesses can contact Mr. Chen He of the association. Furthermore, given that recently various fish businesses have been using the excuse of cash transactions to refuse fishmongers' payment slips, or otherwise requiring a discount of about 20 cents per dollar, which is quite unreasonable, the association has published an advertisement to oppose this practice. Relevant authorities have summoned the person in charge of the association for questioning, and it is expected that this evil trend of discounts can be eliminated soon.</p>

<h3>China Children's Welfare Association This Year's Fundraising Target: 50 Million Yuan for One Month</h3>
<p>The China Children's Welfare Association in this city has been dedicated to rescuing orphaned and impoverished children for over a decade. Since the outbreak of the war, the association has successively sheltered a cumulative total of 10,000 refugee children and currently cares for more than 300. The usual expenses for education and care rely on donations from all sectors of society. In November of last year, the association raised over 10 million yuan in donations and purchased grain, which was exhausted by the end of April this year. Currently, in addition to loans of 3 million yuan from the Xinhua Bank obtained successively by the standing committee members Lin Kanghou and Zhao Jinqing, Mr. Wu Yunzhai, Mr. Chen Bin, Mr. Ding Boxiong, and Mr. Yang Pengnian have each advanced 1 million yuan to cover recurring expenses, allowing the association to continue operating until now. At a time when resources are becoming increasingly scarce and expenses are soaring, it is felt that it is increasingly difficult to maintain operations. If it were not for a broad appeal to benefactors, it would be truly unsustainable. Therefore, it has been decided to launch a fundraising campaign for this year's refugee children's education and care expenses, starting on the 25th of this month, for a period of one month, with a target of 50 million yuan. It is sincerely hoped that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will, at that time, still hold the spirit of "loving other children as we love our own" and contribute generously, so that the association's educational work will not be terminated due to the exhaustion of funds. The benefits to the refugee children will be immeasurable.</p>
