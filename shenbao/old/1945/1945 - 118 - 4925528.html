<h3>日特攻隊繼續猛攻　轟沉敵艦船三艘　冲繩島陸上戰鬥激烈展開</h3>
<p>東京二十七日中央社電　冲繩本為南部地區之敵軍，二十六日上午六時許，與艦砲射擊相呼應，向中央高地方面集中砲擊後，十時許出動有力戰車部隊，向中央正面之仲間（佐敷西南一公里），前田（嘉敷南方一公里半）及幸地（我各古南方三十公里）各方面逐步迫近，與該地日軍展開繳戰。其他各戰錢敵軍行動沉寂，似在作戰攻擊中，同時日特攻隊繼續猛攻敵艦船羣，轟沉其艦型不詳者三艘，二時二十分於慶良間列島四周可見熾烈之對空砲火，下午四時餘，北·中兩機塲方面亦有高射砲火炸裂，由此可見日軍猛攻之一斑。</p>
<h3>日下村總裁廣播　冲繩島戰爭必勝　勉一億國民奮起總攻擊</h3>
<p>東京二十七日中央社電　日情報局總裁下村宏，二十七日下午七時，由電台廣播，題為「勝過冲繩」，以闡明政府情報宣傳方針，同時說明日本國民應付現在戰局之途，而要求全國人民奮起，其要點如下：現在各方面對於政府有種種意見及希望，其最多者為如下兩項：　吾等國民已有覺悟，不論發生任何事件，決不教驚狂，故希當局闡明事實真相。　吾人不知更如何處置，希政府發下大令，指導國民應進途徑。關於第一點，余亦有同感，在今日情形下，不論如何辯解，形勢之不利，確係事實。自塞班島失陷後，硫黃島亦繼入敵手，口日本土亦頓受敵機之襲擊，如此現狀，實未許樂觀，因此，凡有事實必要公開發表，否則惹起種稱謠言，因此最近關於空襲之被害情形，在可能範圍內，均詳細發表。至於第二點，即昂揚士氣，增產兵器，確保食糧，防衛國土等，均已積極提倡，今後重在如何强力實行耳。鈴木首相曾謂：「本內閣無需主張新標語，祗有戰爭一事而巳，且在戰爭祗有勝利而已」。目前迫近吾人眉睫者，乃冲繩之戰，當然，冲繩之戰，不能決定日美之最後勝敗，然塞班·硫黃島失陷後，其結果如何，如今冲繩陷入敵軍手中，不但敵軍獲取攻擊日本之有力基地，且日本與大陸之海上交通受其威脅，吾人想及於此，必須保守冲繩，截至今日止之戰蹟，美國亦承認日本之有利。日本雖不免發生相當犧牲，然關於敵方飛機與艦船之損失，較日方頗大，因此吾人應多製一架飛機，對於前方送多一架，然關於增產飛機，僅憑工廠如何努力，尚鮮效果，必由各方面供給多數材料，則效宏矣。茲舉其一例如暨，鹽為製造炸彈之必要原料，此監須由滿洲及華北方面　船運來，然在今日，船隻既少，且須避免空襲與機雷，致船舶行動意外緩慢。即使船舶抵港，但卸貨亦需相當時間，在南方頻受敵方襲擊，無綸船上之人，陸上之人，將校或兵士，全體一致努力搬運貨物，普通如需二日或三日者，必須在數小時內究成。彼等搬運之人，未知彼等所搬運之監，對於冲繩作戰有如何密切關係，是以恐未能將各目力量發揮至最高度，如果互相間能獲得連絡，各能了解實際情形，則搬運方面當將更見迅速，陸運方面情形亦然，如此將資材運往工廠，如鐵路等能儘可能發揮力量·不使稍有遲延，則對冲繩作戰添上不少力量。今日已非空辯之時代，絕對不容再有批評，或推卸責任，或互相爭綸，凡我國民皆應捨棄一切私心，躬自反省，和衷協力，以決死之覺悟，致奉公之忱。今日前綫後方必須一致，以決死之覺悟，舉總力應付冲繩作戰，響應海陸總特攻之將士以及當地島民諸君之奮鬥，一億國民各起總攻擊，則神州必不滅，大東亞戰爭完成可期。</p>
<h3>接見外記者</h3>
<p>東京二十七日中央社電　日情報局下村總裁，二十六日下午接見外籍記者時，曾答質問如下：</p>
<p>問，日本國民對敵機空襲之反響如何？</p>
<p>答，罹災者之情緒與平時無異，精神與肉體亦甚輕爽，翹首企望他日捲土重來，敵之轟炸神社佛閣，由當時情勢推測及親自視察被焚舊跡，皆可斷言為有計劃的轟炸，敵會轟炸東京明治神宮，淺草觀音，神戶凑川神社及其他日人認為聖地之各處，此等事實，反是以繳揚日人敵愾心理。</p>
<p>問，各報皆稱冲繩作戰為決戰，未識日人是否認識此項事實？</p>
<p>答，全日本國民皆完全認識冲繩作戰之重要性，且深知在硫黃島為敵幕握之後，若再進攻冲繩必受威脅。</p>
<p>問，日人對德軍之抗戰作何感想？</p>
<p>答，日人與世界各國國民感想相同，認為德軍抗戰洵值驚艦，蓋德國國民皆具敢鬥精神，相信德軍此種敢鬥精神，今後尚能繼續發揮。</p>
<h3>日陸軍省發表　勇士授感狀　平井中尉等共十六名</h3>
<p>東京二十七日中央社電　日陸軍省頃發表，特別攻擊飛行隊陸軍中尉平井俊光，陸軍少尉高祖一·宮水卓·吉本勝吉·兒子國高·西尾卓三等十六名勇士，參加南西羣島方面作戰，對敵艦船作壯烈之衝撞，建樹殊動，特授予感狀，並奏呈日皇聞達。</p>
<h3>敵機分批襲九州台灣</h3>
<p>福岡二十七日中央社電　敵方因受日軍特攻隊之痛擊，乃出動馬時亞納基地之B29型機，施行戰略轟炸，二十六日曾來襲九州山口地區，復於二十七日上午八時許，分二批來襲南九州地區，主力B29型機約一百架，自薩應及大隅兩半島侵人。又一部份約五十架左右，自豐後水道侵入，以泉都城，鹿屋四周飛機塲為主要目標投彈，十時過後，向東南方海面逸去，日方損害輕微。</p>

<h3>蘇垣籌組難民救濟會</h3>
<p>蘇州二十七日中央社電　蘇省府以省會地區人烟稠密，際此戰時茍發生空襲等災難，影響治安極鉅，為防患未然，特籌組省會難民救濟協會，已函聘當地士神為籌備員，現正積極籌備中。</p>
<p>徐州通信</p>
<h3>新淮海一瞥（下）</h3>
<p>— 逸飛</p>
<p>敎育文化事業</p>
<p>淮海省教育實距理想尚遠，就省會所在地徐州市而言，目前僅有中學三處，完全小學十七處，初小十處，私立小學六處，民教館一處·共有中小學生一萬四千多人。以教室之不敷，學生每日分兩班，是間午後，輪流入學。又全市學齡完童，約計四萬四千餘人，兩者相較，故現下大學兒童，約有三萬餘人。情形實屬嚴重，茲郝省長除着手先於上月在徐州市成立「地方教育事業委員會」。邀當地紳商名流，共裹是舉外，又為統盤籌劃，及聽取各縣教育工作人員之報告起見，曾於三月十四日在省府大禮堂，召開淮海教育會議，計到有二十個單位，代表兩百餘人，薈聚一堂，相互研討。開會期間，郝氏親臨訓話，除說明今後准海教育推行主旨，對目前重際問題，亦多所指示，並啓示諸代表「以樸實精誠來完成救國救民之偉業，正已而後正人，作今後師資規範，剋苦耐勞，開暢胸襟，加强志量，為今後訓練靑年之鵠的。」</p>
<p>以淮海當局之重視教育與文化事業，故來自京滬各地之文化人，在此頗呈活躍，曾由中日文化協會淮海分會主辦，於月之九日舉行「戰時文化座談會」，到有各文化機關人員五十餘人，情形至為熱烈。會中開誠討綸一切戰時文化有關問題，並於事後發表「戰時文化建設宣言」，以期喚起各方之協力。</p>
<p>省府為適應決戰體制，推行戰時文化宣傳基本政策，力求出版檢在機構一元化起見，曾於月之十日召集有關機關代表多人，對省會出版檢查辦法，加以檢討，事後議決由省府設立出版檢查室，統辦今後對出版物檢查指導事宜，以期促進該省文化事業之發展。</p>
<p>建設工業運動</p>
<p>盟邦協力委員會：淮海省政府為積極推進該省之建設運動，曾成立「淮海省建設委員會」，以期羅致官民間熟情之士，集中黨政軍民各階層之力量，推行是項運動。並於月之三日在省府召開百次建設會議，在郝省長領導下，作初步工作之檢討。事後徐州市盟邦僑民之有力份子，羣起響應，踴躍輪將，紛捐巨款，以期共同協力究成新淮海之建設。捐款最多者，為「華北烟葉統制組合」之小宮新一氏，獨捐百萬元，又川部靜一氏捐五十萬元，金城電影院主人進信三郎亦捐三百萬元。現日僑方面，已成立「盟邦協力委員會」，以資對僑民作全面之鼓吹。</p>
<p>準備輕工業之建設：淮海省輕工業之建設，現亦趨白熱化，除熱烈期待京滬各地之大資本家，來淮投資興辦，與工廠搬移來此，並組有負有專責之機關「工業開發協會」外，復鑒於水源對發展工業之重要性，曾成立「淮海省　井公司」從事開發水源，以為興展輕工業計劃之初步準備，前此因無良好之探試機，難知水源所在，工作不能如預期之順利，茲已由省府之小川經濟顧問，與「華北開發公司」而妥，由北平這該公司所有之電波探察機來徐，從事工作，除已完成之十餘眼外，照每月六眼之計算，原有計劃開掘之預期數目五十眼，當可於年內全部完成，今後水源問題自可迎刃而解。</p>
<p>又淮海省為適應當前環境之需要，並謀將來工業發展後貨物間題之解決起見，於最近成立「淮海省運輸管理避」，强化省境運輸機構。</p>
<p>農業增產改良</p>
<p>按淮海省地當蘇豫皖三省要衝，介乎華中華北之間，握津浦隴海兩綫之交點，為軍事，政治，經濟之重鎭，土地肥沃，出產豐富，棄有「中國倉庫」之稱。農產物以小麥為大宗，產額第年除本省消耗外，年可餘存五十萬噸，向供給華北。茲淮海當局，為提倡小麥之增產，擬作進一步之努力，改良小麥種子，迭經試騐結果，證明「華家六號種子」最適宜淮海之土質，現已由本省「採種動」負責繁殖此項種子，事後轉發各縣家家採用，開展全面小麥之增產，想日後定有驚人之成績。至於關於施肥，除轟等工作，亦在籌劃中，不日作有效推行實施之辦法。</p>
<p>至甘肅之繁殖，亦在積極提倡中，現已採用日本良種，從事增產，其獻數將擴充至兩百萬畝，其預期之收義量，將較土報超越兩倍以上，此舉對本省民食與軍需原料，皆有莫大之貢獻也。</p>
<p>淮海當局對開懇荒田之工作，進行不遣餘力，目前第一步將木省沿津浦路綫兩側之荒地，從事調查，茲已查得約一萬畝，現正研究長體開懇辦法。</p>
<p>合作社之擴展</p>
<p>淮海居民，大半為農夫，該省合作社之常務理事任洪顯氏，於三月下旬分別派員前往各縣視察，並催促成立各縣這互助社，俾對農民生活，有所改善。</p>
<p>該社為對無產農民及小本經紀人，進行春耕，辦理小規模營業便利起見，特舉辦短期信用借款，凡屬社員，皆能實得其惠。其辦法由社內特設之放款處，負責處理，採分期歸還法。即借款限期共五十日，分十次拔還，五日一次。至放款數額則分四種：甲種為五千圓，乙種四千元，丙種三千元，丁種二千元，其利息為每百元五元。</p>
<p>又過去配給手櫝，係由省合作社分發與縣合作社，再由其轉至鄉村合作社，經鄉保長之手轉給農夫，手續繁複，流弊難免，故事變前鄉間農民，十九未測收到社方之配給物，茲已由該社職員負責直接交與農民，故無前此中飽剝削之事發生。此舉深得農民擁戴，並測增加其對合作社之信仰。茲悉該社已進一步辦理消費合作，現籌得巨款，購辦農民所需之日和品，運至各縣，直接以低價售給農民，同時為減除農民出售其所有農作物時運輸，作價等困難手續，亦由該社代為統運出售，以輕其負担。（完）</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>舉辦農貸的具體問題</h3>
<p>我們對於導引游資，挽救上海社會經濟危機，前曾就恢復工業生產，在內地建立小型日用品工廠及舉辦農村貸款等，分別加以論列，尤其是關於舉辦農貴，認為最有提前促成的必要。因為如能有計劃有步驟的辦理成功，既可以解決本市日趨嚴重的游資問題，有裨於社會經濟的安定，而且使游資導入生產農民之手以後，又可以挽救目前農　於野的危機，促進農業增產，解決了今日都市和農村最嚴重的經濟問題，同時也就解決了日趨嚴重的社會與政治問題，使在旁窺何的共產黨無法乘機活動。本月二十五日大陸新報論「農村貸款與盤業組織」，列舉農村貸款幾個具體問題，極中肯聚。我們認為今日最光決的問題，就是怎樣迅速籌款成功？</p>
<p>在原則上，舉辦農　既經市政詻詢委員會一致通過，事在必行，自無疑義。因為此舉既可表示上海市民對戰爭之協力，援助農村增加生產；又可救濟農村而防止共黨的煽惑；而有經濟上及政治上的重要意義。將來農產增加，對於本市最嚴重的民食問題也可因此疏解。我們今日所急需做到的是；　集款必求迅速，　市民澈底瞭解自動籌　，　確定貸款本息的辦法。</p>
<p>關於農貸的具體辦法，為迅奏事功起見，必須分工合作將農貸工作，劃分三大步驟，即集資貸放和還本。關於集資方面，我們認為這是上海人士的基本責任。這一步驟迅速成功。上海人士的任務便已完成，集資的時間如感迫促，可分期籌集。籌募對象，以有錢出錢有力出力為原則，各大公司各大商號及現仍開工的工廠，乃至熱心於社會公益人土，自常義不容辭，率先倡導。</p>
<p>關於貸放方面，如果自行設立機構，延聘專家調查研究以至實施，費時較久，為適應農村迫切需要，直接由江蘇省政府辦理，比較駕輕就熟。其次，關於貸放方法，農民生產所需，不必盡為現金，如肥料農具種籽等等亦頗需要。至於貸放的對象，自以直接入於生產農民之手為基本原則。如以農民團體（如合作社）為對象，自無不可，但合作社是否真為農民本身組織，則為前提問題，必須當地地方政府就實際情形加以抉擇。</p>
<p>關於還本一點，原則上必須做到：　還本之時期不能過短、至早在新穀登塲以後，因為這次貧款並非純經濟性，而含有政治意義。　保木保息，雖屬需要，但同時顧到上海舉辦農貸主要目的，在解除江蘇產米區農民苦痛，增加生產，因而調節滬市民食，因此，貸款條件，不必斤斤計較，但希望江蘇省府能就各地餘糧酌量商借運滬，平優發售，達到互助互利的原意，則尤為兩便。光陰易逝，時機迫促，希望有關方面暨熟心人士迅起推動，早觀厥成。</p>
<p>譯論</p>
<h3>農村貸款與農業組織</h3>
<p>上海游資導入農村，促進農業增產，挽救上海經濟脫離游資蠢動的危機，因而解決農村與都市的經濟問題，確為一舉二得的措置。這種嘗試，即將逐步實現，洵為可喜的現象。</p>
<p>將上海游資五十萬萬元導入農村，決非易事。五十萬萬元數目，縱然在通貨膨脹的現在，仍不失為巨額資金。因此，貸款計劃者與賣金放出者皆須異常的努力，并抱犧性精神。我們希望兩者能够克服困難，達到所期的目的。農村貸款成功之途，先須上海工作成功，兀成籌集資金，同時地方亦整備容納的勢態，使該項資金確實轉入農民之手。</p>
<p>農民如何缺少生產資金，已無須再論。他們因為缺乏生產與生活的資金，不得已向地主與高利貸者以可驚的高利借入款項，或則出賣靑苗，以渡目前的難關。倘若放任不顧，則不僅農民經濟瀕於破產，農業生產亦將急激減少，是以農村貸款實為同時匡救農民經濟與農業生產的方法。為往速完成起見，使農貸資金究全而且低利的流入農民手中的良好指導，實屬必要。</p>
<p>過去辦理農業貸款者，有中國銀行，交通銀行，上海商業儲蓄銀行及事變前的合作社等，由事變前的經騐而論，他們辦理的農貸，尚不能認為成功。蓋利用農貸　金者幾乎全係地主，高利貸者及合作社的幹部等，他們將此轉貸農民，獲取利息，而農民成為負債奴隸的條件，却絲亳未見改善。</p>
<p>使農業貸款能有完美的成效起見，必須將此類中間榨取者從貸付的實施過程排除出去。至其方法，我們以為，不外是農民組織的擴充與利用。農村貸款如以個人為對象，必成為高利貸的借款，祗有以組織為對象時，才可克服這種弊病，此點有過去的經騐可以證實。因此，謂農民組織的擴充與活用為完成農貸唯一無二的方法，並非過甚其詞。</p>
<p>事變後的農民組織，最可注意的是合作社，尤其是淸鄉地區合作社，不妨視之為普遍的農民組機。倘若强化淸鄉地區合作社的組織，使為其下部機構的生產互助社等活動更趨活潑，與上海的農貸運動呼應，則農貸即可順利實現。當然，規在的合作社如欲總括的容受農貸資金，在組織上尚有不充分之點。因此，上海農貸富事者及地方合作社關係者均有共同考慮的必要。（譯自四月廿五日大陸新報）</p>

<h3>滿特派大使張景惠廣播表明不動決意</h3>
<p>東京二十七日中央社電　滿洲國特派大使張景惠氏，二十六日下午七時二十分廣播，略謂，此次戰爭實決定全亞洲隆替之大戰，決非一國之戰爭，故本人深信唯由大東亞各國緊密團結，集中戰力，舉其一切於完遂戰爭，始能爭取勝利。滿洲國在地理上言，處於與日本協力發揮戰力之適當位置，自皇帝陛下第一次訪日以來，即與日本皇室結以深交，以一德一心，奠定兩國永久關係，已十年於茲。今逢大東亞戰爭決戰階段，已臨發揮一體戰力之秋，本人藉此機會，特表明滿洲國上下舉國不動之決意。</p>

<h3>舊金山會議　空氣緊張　廠結在波蘭問題</h3>
<p>里斯本二十七日中央社電　據華盛頓電：蘇外委長莫洛托夫二十六日已接獲關於波蘭問題決定蘇聯最後態度之史太林訓令，並決定與艾登·斯蒂丁紐斯會風時羽明該項訓令，至於其內容尙不得明獻。惟英美早已表示不讓步之堅强態度，舊金山會議將來成敗，胥視二十六日之三國外長會議結果如何而定，舊金山現已籠單於緊張空氣之下。據合衆社記者威爾遜報吿稱，三大國問之關係，因波蘭問題而有一觸即發之勢，舊金山會議中全體代表究全為堅强空氣所支配，總之，波蘭問題之命遝，當已經三國外長會談時決定，莫洛托夫在會議席上之演說中，恐亦曾表示蘇方最後之態度，惟此係最危急之問題，蘇聯或不致在公開席上表明其態度。</p>

<h3>華中水電公司上海電氣支店</h3>
<p>— 家熙</p>
<p>——本市公用事業解剖之一</p>
<p>華中水電股份有限公司上海電氣支店，為軍管理上海電力公司於去年七月改組而成。上海電力公司之前身，為上海工部局電氣處，成立於一八九○年，當時發電在斐倫路裹虹橋畔，原動力爲內燃機，營範關僅供給用戶電光，後以上海工商業日趨繁榮，工廠以電力為原動力者亦漸多，於是在一九一二年乃另擇他地建防新廠，佔地三百餘畝，並裝置鍋爐及汽輸發電機，燃燒蒸汽為發電之原動力，發電量亦增加，時廠中共有鍋爐約八隻，發電機二部，後又陸續增加，斐倫路老廠至是乃停止發電。至一九二八年九月，上海公共租界工部局以籌募收回公債為由，以八千一百萬元之代價，出售予美商電力公司，乃更名為上海電力公司。其中八千萬為工部局所得，一百萬為西人職員之養老金及備蓄金與華人職工之養老金。楊樹浦新廠有鍋爐三十隻，汽輪發電機十五部，發電量約十九萬餘基羅瓦特，目下又店長為鍋島卬八。</p>
<p>組織機構</p>
<p>上海電氣支店的行政管理，和從前的電力公司大同小異，從前負指揮裁決之賣者為總裁一人及副總裁一人，其下則總副經理各一人。工程處及秘書處（即總務）直屬之。工程部設總工程師一及副總工程師二，輸電及饋電用戶工程及發電等三部直隸其下，購料委員會亦屬之。發電工程部及發電廠在新廠，輸電與饋電工程總辦事處在口口路大厦，舉凡高壓綫（分三種：22000V由發電廠至分站，6600V由分站至方棚間）之裝置，修理，維持設計及低壓綫之配備，敷設，修理，維持等工程，皆由制負責。所轄部門有大綫班，高頭班，馬達間，電灶間，火表間。大綫班為敷設地下電續工程之執行部；高頭班係架空電綫之執行者；馬達間為修理檢查用戶工廠馬達之達施及保管與整理馬達之部；電灶間爲設計裝置及修理用戶電熱用具之部；火表間係修理，管理，裝置及檢驗公司自用或用戶之量電表之部，而檢查用戶偷電，斷絕用戶電源及接用電源等工作亦由之負責；打樣間（即設計問）亦直覺輸電與饋電工程部，購料委員會除小件物品由棧房直接購置，煤炭由總工程師發電廠廠長燃料化騐師等負責外，其他絕緣物，電氣用具，建築材料等皆直接由其購買。用戶工程部所直轄之部門，為用戶工程部，用戶關室，樣子間及用戶付賬處。用戶工程係代用戶設計，預計各區用電之數量，解決用戶之困難及調查業務之機關。</p>
<p>發電程序</p>
<p>發電廠工程之最重要奢為帮沛間，車間，爐子間，電氣開關問，方棚，配電間等，其次要者為吊煤間及煤曆間，油帮浦問，皮帶間。</p>
<p>發電工作過程：自帮浦間吸水供給爐十間，並由吊煤車間自躉船上運煤至皮帶間，轉運至爐子間作燃料，高熱及高壓之蒸汽遂由管導至車間推動汽輪及發電機，電流乃由是而發生，經配電間整理電壓，以電力開啓電氣開關後，電流乃經方棚與開關而至滙電桿，再經配電室以電力開啓饋電分站之電氣開關，電流乃可輸送至饋電分站發電之任務於此完成。</p>
<p>蒸氣經汽輪機後，廢氣必需以冷水擬結使化為水，再以水帮浦抽至爐子間，因水之溫度尚高，用煤量可節省，方棚以油為絕繳物，但以方棚內熱度頗高，恐失絕緣之效，故設袖帮浦間，使油循環流行，並用水冷却之。（未完）</p>

<p>敵美業巳在冲繩本島登陸了。在這戰爭形勢下曾去視察防衛在冲繩本島登陸了。在這戰爭形勢是銅墻鐵壁的「九州要塞」。</p>
<p>訪部隊長</p>
<p>進竹桿所掩護的衛兵所，在洞口上掛着和塞班島勇士熱血所寫成的「誓死成為太平洋的防波堤」牌匾一樣，「誓死殺敵」的字這就是某樣。戰鬥指揮所。小的森林就是天孫降臨的聖地，是某王家的舊城古跡。現在這塊聖地是策調殺敵的「大本營」。全都古城都利用作近代戰的堡壘，往昔的壕溝便作成作戰通路，此外現在鎭日在掘挖橫穴壕和連絡壕。</p>
<p>地下兵營裏業已按上了電燈，年靑的兵士在惚忙地勞動着。情戰室滿裝着電話機，通信兵在手裏把着電話，時時刻刻在準備着傳達消息。</p>
<p>爬到了最上層，此處是部隊本部，亦是半地下式的兵營。一位部隊長精神奕奕地說：</p>
<p>「愛國只有一條道路。際此期間，必須絕對保護鄕土。如敵敢大膽來犯，則只有不分男女老幼，共同起來以敢死隊精神與敵拚命。」</p>
<p>九州最南端的○○灣，寗靜而沉默。像穿插着海岸綫一樣的鎭西，有睥睨着太平洋而難攻易守的要塞在護衛着。K部隊長表示着堅決的同仇敵愾心說：</p>
<p>「這方面是敵人最喜歡的砂灘，洋鬼子想來，無諭從什麼地方都是可以來的。所以不能按照普通戰法作戰，建立據點，據守戰壕和工事或城池。按照我們犧牲最少的神經戰，乘夜偷營，大膽實行突擊，必須消滅其最後之一兵一將。我們的將士都非常的勇敢，且非常的機警。這樣的將士如實行敢死隊式的突擊，我認為決有把握。」</p>
<p>最後又有力地加上一句說：</p>
<p>「日本人是性急的。現在的戰爭，這樣是不行的，必須要沉着才有辦法。」</p>
<p>能收容全部市民的橫穴　，在山腰中挖着無數。就是敵機來侵，這便成為最好的空中防波堤。如由陸地來，所有這些壕便成為發火點，能配合某要塞與敵人以常頭痛擊，於是○○灣口將成爲美國鬼子的墳墓。</p>
<p>航空要塞　穿過高原的茶園，去訪問九州南部的航空要塞。「在地面上豎立着的建築物，已經逐漸失去了現代的面目，而成為前世紀的古董了。基地附屬的工塲設施全部，都　到地下去工作了。一部份　已完成了。」這是H部隊長在新幾內亞所得到的寳貴經騐。</p>
<p>在基地的周圍，由旅部隊長的領導和設計，以後老百姓熟忱地帮忙，不停地建築○公里的地下城市。勤勞奉公隊，學童，近鄕的普通老百姓一，都表示着「要保衛我們的基地！」拚命參加工作，眞是所謂披星戴月地工作着。甚至女工也來參加工作，並且組織敢死隊，不分晝夜地工作，和每日滿頭大汗地訓練着。記者隨着部隊長的指引，踏着火山灰的山道，巡視地下　的建築工程。這一個高壕也是古來的舊城遺跡。這一個只有空名的壕，業巳成為汽車公路了。在白灰色的山　中，有一個很大的洞穴，裏面雖陰沉和黑暗，但有人在不斷工作着。部隊長對於這批人，一一地道謝「辛苦！辛苦！」。</p>
<p>「這眞是上天給與我們一個絕好試煉的機會。我們日本人縱令使一草一木不存，也必須爭取勝利」。部隊長這樣堅決地表示着。</p>
<p>山上據點　順便又去訪問某據點。這個山最高，一個峯脈像波浪起伏一樣遠遠地伸出海面，該峯　的所有山腰，完全作成了砲台。順着小路，踏着雜草，走向梅林而發現了陣地。這就是○○砲，鑽進溝這，才看見○○砲。這個時候，有兩個兵士抬着笨重的資材箱，上山來了。一物不拿的我們都感覺這條山路非常危險，看到士兵這樣辛苦，眞使我感奮起來。勇士們不僅作這樣辛苦的工作，而且在夜裏，在白犬工作過度疲倦不堪的身體，還要拚命受肉搏攻擊的訓練。永邊上有一塊人所看不見的平地，這就是等待敵人登陸而作殊死戰的陣地。敵人要來就來吧！這是勇士們全體所有的表示。（譯自四月六日讀賣報知）</p>
<h3>特攻隊養成所</h3>
<p>零式戰鬥機的編隊漫天飛舞，彷彿亂絲，忽而直線，忽而曲線。銀翼閃閃，反射着春天的陽光，各機用異常高的速度，亂舞空中。這是某海軍航空隊的空戰訓練。空巾的格鬥如果是這樣的美麗，那末戰爭該是很好玩的了。</p>
<p>轟隆轟隆—一架又一架，向着戰鬥指揮所。高度×千，一瞬間即到。這是俯衝轟炸訓練。鳴—飛機俯衝到頭上，相差只有五十米，突又抬起了機首。在防風玻璃後面，都有一張笑臉。他們都是預備學生出身的年靑士官。</p>
<p>道個戰鬥機隊充滿了殺氣。在這盡量使用國內無數飛行基地以殲滅敵軍的今日，正是發揮本土航空要塞强點的基地作戰的良機，這個戰鬥基地的充溢緊張氣氛，是當然的。</p>
<p>敵軍已開始應用硫黃島飛行塲。在馬里亞納集結相當架數的B20型。而且更在冲繩島上了陸。戰况是愈加淒烈了，其慘烈悲壯，正可說生死在此一戰。在以速度和機動力為主的航空作戰中，這個基地也參加殺戮南西能島敵軍的征伐，迄今已派出如干次特攻隊。</p>
<p>空中的格鬥，需要高性能的飛機，與變化多端的巧妙空戰技術。由於這個要求，因而不斷砥礪，在嚴格的訓練下養成精良的空中戰士。預備學生出身的士官宿舍，本來掛着一塊「學生舍」的牌子，近來不知在什麼時候已改為「神風舍」了。並且有人作了一首雄壯的神風歌。在這充滿全體特攻的熱誠的「神風舍」中，起居動作比以前更為沉着安靜，舍內的軍紀嚴肅整齊，形成一種優良的風氣。在神風舍裏面的航空隊神社，學員們必定一天去禮拜數回，這已成為一種新的習慣了。</p>
<p>「我們不久也要去拼命了。我們得用功學習　何死法。」輕輕的一句話，像春風掠過了柳絲。神風舍裏的人，在神宮外苑和上野的神社等受到同胞熱烈的歡送，以學生的資格踏上前線，現在已經都是中尉和少尉，担任指揮的職務，成為道地的武人了。</p>
<p>從早長七時起，到午後二時止，實行儀器飛行訓練。遛一日，天氣晴朗，春日照在身上，懶洋洋地。學員們帶着黑黑的眼鏡，單靠着儀器，實行肓目飛行。所駕的零式戰鬥機，是一種小型高速的優秀飛機。他們緊緊握住操縱桿，戰戰兢兢地，一心一意駕駛着它，因為操縱零式戰鬥機在他們還是第一次哩。</p>
<p>在塵砂瀰漫的戰鬥指揮所前面，　集了一羣人。其中有淸瘦精悍的司令，在拉巴爾當過航空參謀的剛强飛行長，有非使敵機敵艦化為報粉不可的飛行隊長。他們任視着在上空飛行的各架飛機。前幾天，敵小型機來製時，這一隊零式戰鬥機隊，在其光榮的傳統下，曾駕駛訓練用零式戰鬥機——它們是因為稍有瑕疵才撥到這裘來專供訓練用的——從雲上奇襲格拉曼四架的編隊，一舉而毀其三架，建立這個功勳的，就是此隊的敎官A兵曹長。在這樣的師長薰陶之下，學員們不但學得了最高的戰鬥技術，並且養成了無畏的精神。</p>
<p>特攻隊的武器就是百煉千錘的訊練！訓練就是戰鬥，戰鬥就是全體飛機實行特別攻擊！這一個專門養成特攻人才的基地，正在蓄積着堅强無畏的戰力。（三上特派員，譯自四月五日朝日新聞）</p>
<h3>近距離戰鬭用　爆炸兵器</h3>
<p>白刃戰。肉搏戰，疋是一死報國的日軍特擅的決戰之法。在這隨地展開肉搏衝鋒的血戰時，不禁使人要間：現代戰爭中，近距離戰鬥用的兵器有幾種？　　除刺刀，手槍，步槍，軍刀一　以外，其他還有手溜彈，手投　雷等，以及對戰事兵器，擲彈筒，火焰瓶等，而其中以炸藥所負的使命最為重要。茲將日軍近距離戰鬥時所用的幾件兵器略述於後，以供一般的參考。</p>
<p>手榴彈　這是很容易用手丟出去的炸彈，也稱手投彈。所裝的炸藥，用黃色藥。炸藥量約五十瓦，彈體重約三百瓦。彈長約十　，徑五　。其威力，經過一定時間（約四秒），即會炸裂，其破片效力足以殺傷人馬，範圍的大小為半徑五公尺。</p>
<p>投擲時，經過普通的練習，約可擲到三十公尺左右。投擲以前，取去安全裝置，完成發火準備，時機一到，就使其信管發火，確定已經發火之後，立刻將它丟出去。但須注意：其爆發時間如前所述，約為四秒鐘，所以手脚稍慢一點，頗有在手中爆炸的危險。另一方面，丟得太早，則有被敵人在其尙未爆發時拾起來倒擲過來之懼。再則，其威力半徑有五公尺，如果敵人的距離很近，弄得不好連自己也一同炸在裏面，所以必須小心。</p>
<p>擲彈筒　是步兵携着走的有柄筒，附有調節發火裝置及擲射距離的轉輪，口徑五十耗，全長約六百耗，重量五公斤，最大射程七百公尺。至於使用法，就是扶住擲彈筒，臥伏地上，將手溜彈及其他炸藥裝置筒內，一撥機括即會發射出去。擲射距離由筒身的傾斜角度和火藥量等而定。普通由兩個兵使用之，一個是射手，一個是彈藥手。</p>
<p>手投爆雷　這是保持炸藥的持久性，直到碰撞戰車等物時才起爆炸的對戰車兵器。為保持持久性起見，炸藥也用特殊形狀的。而且，因為塡量有限制，所以必須分量少而炸力大的炸藥。此種手投爆雷，對於輕的車輛有充分的破壞力，其投擲距離約二十公尺。對抗戰車的兵器，除出爆雷和對戰車砲以外，在近距離戰鬥時，並用火焰瓶和吸着式爆雷。</p>
<p>火焰瓶　玻璃球內裝入炸藥，外面塗以粘着液，使它粘附戰車而爆</p>
<p>吸着式爆雷　此為利用磁力吸着戰軍而炸裂的裝置，普通所裝的炸藥量在一公斤以下，所以非投到五公尺至十公尺的近距離內，其效果便不大。而且不能狙擊戰車裝甲車較薄的後部及上部等處，破壞力殊欠充分。總之，此等爆雷必須接近戰車。最近德蘇使用火箭式的，可稱為投擲作用的動力化。伊萱</p>
<h3>本市衛生設施近况</h3>
<p>— 袁濬昌</p>
<p>——昨在上海電台廣播演詞——</p>
<p>各位聽衆：本人忝任本市衛生局長，今晚趁這個機會，在這裏報告關於最近本市衛生行政上的幾件事，同時也希望我們全體市民加以注意和協助，因為這幾件事有關民族健康，也是每個市民都有切身利害關係的事。</p>
<p>第一，今年霍亂預防注射，已把全體工作人員組成中央隊，滬東隊，滬南隊，滬西隊，滬北隊和高橋隊六個大隊。自從本月二十日起，開始全面實施注射工作，預計兩期注射的人數約六百萬人，希望市民就近前往各注射站接受注射，切勿規避。要知道規避注射，不但害了自己，並且還要害着別人。因為你假如規避着注射，將來得到了霍亂病症，就會傳染到還沒有注射的別人，這不是一件很危險的事嗎？所以希望各位市民務須踴躍地就近前往接受注射，去年因為注射的人數多，預防得好，所以沒有　性霍亂發現；今年或許是霍亂年，本人期望今年注射的人數更加多，那末霍亂仍不致發生。</p>
<p>第二，最近本年發現着白　的病症，這病症學齡兒童最易傳染，尤以學齡兒童過着團體生活，更易傳染，所以本局已從學校兒童着手注射白喉類　素，以免蔓延，希望市民凡有兒女的都注意到這一點。</p>
<p>第三，最近市上發現非法商人貪圖厚利，把病死猪隻，逃避本局肉品檢查人員檢騐工作，來混充食肉出售的事情。本人非常重視，因為病死猪隻全體已滿佈着病菌，假如把它充作食肉，不是人們簡直就在吃猪身上的病菌嗎？你們試想一想害怕不書怕？所以這些非法商人的不道德行為，也可說在滅絕人類，本人已嚴勵督促全體肉檢工作人員和環境衛生檢查員，今後加緊努力工作，並在通衢要道隨時巡查，從嚴取締，必須把病死猪隻混充食肉的一回事，今後絕對絕跡，同時希望市民各自注意，凡是猪肉上沒有蓋着本局肉品檢騐迄的圖章或是已檢騐過而認為不合人類食用蓋着斥品圖章的肉品，切不可購食，切不可食圖一時的價錢便宜，來以身嘗試猪身上的病菌，給病菌得到機會來潛伏在人體裏邊；另一方面還希望市民協助政府來切實嚴厲取統，遇有不合食用的肉品混充食肉買賣時，立即報告本局從嚴取締。</p>
<p>第四，天氣將漸漸地熱了，馬路旁的冷飲攤就要漸漸地多着。這種冷飲攤大多不合衛生的，即使沒有蒼蠅躲着，但這種冷飲品的成份裏邊，或是原料並不淸潔，或是有着生冷的水在裏邊，有些水菓，甘蔗，荸齊，藕，靑菱，洒着不淸潔的冷水，也不合衛生的。本來本局對品，是隨時隨地在取締的，現在將要到夏令的時候，霍亂最容易發生，這種冷飲品更加應該從嚴取締，希望市民對於不合衛生的冷飲品，切勿輕易嘗試。</p>
<p>第五，關於各馬路過去時常有堆積垃圾事情發生，非但不合衛生，並且有碍市容觀瞻，本人異常注意。垃圾是每家每天會產生出來的，如果不去情除，當然會越積越多，這事是任何人會見到的。本人自任衛生局長，職責攸關，當然更決不會漠不關心地任它堆積，徒然給市民見了厭惡，也時時刻刻要設法淸除；可是有時候也會有着不得巳的實際難題，擺在面前，以致一時不能依着原定辦法淸除，譬如工人的待遇本來很低薄的，現在雖然已經增加了，可是原有的搓運坎圾的車輛，一天天用得舊了壞了，以致能使用的車輛一天減少一天，那末不及淸除而堆積的垃圾，會成比例的一天多着一天，這是一個不容忽視的嚴重間題。現在對於修理車輛應用的材料，已經購買，並且已經呈請上峯馬上派員騐收，以便動用興修，那時候垃圾車輛，就可一天多着一天，市內垃圾如果市民們能够不再隨地拋棄傾倒的話，那末就可不致再有堆積的事情發生。現在天氣將要熱了，更希望市民不要隨地傾倒，免得繁殖着蒼蠅傳播病菌。同時希望保甲人員，密切地協助合作，隨時阻止市民不要再把垃圾隨地傾倒。因爲垃圾是家家戶戶每天曾產生出來的，注重衛生也是家家戶戶應該注意的，如果有着一家人家不注意衛生，因而生着時疫疾病，馬上會傳染到旁人，所以由保甲人員協助本局阻止市民隨地傾倒垃圾是最好的一個辦法，希望保甲人員和市民們密切地來合作。</p>
<p>第六，現在的生活程度，一天天的高漲着，貧苦產婦生產費用也成了嚴重的問題，所以本局正在計劃在市區內設立一所平民產科醫院，呈請市政府核准後就可成立。但是在沒有成立以前，本局已經向本市廣慈醫院特約，暫且在這個醫院裏邊附設着免費產科病床幾十只，凡是本市貧苦的產婦，確實是沒有力量繳納費用的話，那末可以向本局申請，經本局核准以後，送到這個醫院裏去住院生產，給她一概免費。另外還向各公私立產婦科醫院，接洽收受免費或者減費貧苦產婦，希望聽衆們碰到貧苦的產婦，把這個消息轉告給她。</p>
<p>第七，我國一向有一句話，「民為邦本」，但是我國同胞的死亡率是很高的，這是一件很可慮的事。考查它的原因，不外乎因為國人衛生敎育的水準太低，所以對於衛生敎育的推進，是不容或緩。本局曾經向上海電台和法國電台洽定，經常由本局派員播講衛生常識，更想同保甲當局聯絡，定期召集保甲長舉行衛生敎育懇談會，並且打算定期舉行衛生運動大會，等到市政府把經費核准後，就可以舉行。去年衛生運動大會參觀的民衆很多，今年如果事實上可能舉行的話，請各位聽衆前往參觀參觀，是很有意義的。</p>
<p>第八，本人兼着遍市民防空本部救護處處長的職務，救護處工作人負是從衛生局調派職員兼充的，因為看到木市空襲漸漸地多了，所以已經準備被襲底時候救護工作的辦法。大要是：依照警察分局區域，除掉海軍保甲區以外，在蘇州河以南和浦東設立救護隊，共十三個單位，以便空襲的時候，馬上施行救護，每一個單位也就是每一個區域，設救護隊長一人，由本地有名醫院院長擔任，負責支配他本區裏邊各項救護事情，就在各區內把所有的醫院和醫師分別組成重傷醫院，輕傷醫院，救護站。凡是人民受到重傷必須施行大手術的時候，那末送重傷醫院去醫治，凡是人民受到輕傷，必須施行小手術的時候，那末送輕傷醫院去醫治，凡是受傷的人民祇要搽藥包紮的話，那末由救護站辦理之。至於防空本部防空訓練所所辦的救護班，也是由本局派人擔任敎練，本局並且在局子裏在各級公務員裏邊遴選人員，組織特別救護隊，施行嚴格的防空救護訓練，和普通的軍事知識，以便將來派到各救護區裏邊擔任指導救護底工作，現在正在趕緊訓練中。所以對於本市以後被襲的時候救護事情，已有相當辦法。但是仍希望市民在空襲的時候，趕快的設法避免危險，這是很要緊的</p>
<p>其他關於本局勵行醫藥管理，整頓市立醫院和診療所，擴展學校衛生，普及衛生敎育，推廣婦要衛生，實施勞工衛生和監獄衛生等等問題，有些已經發表過了，其餘以後有機會的時候再談。</p>
<h3>取締黃色新聞</h3>
<p>— 姚炯</p>
<p>不久前發生的詹周氏斬殺親夫案，經各報揭載後，立刻傳遍了全上海，成為各種人茶餘酒後的閒談資料了。甚至竟有不肖之徒從中造謠，引得滿街滿弄人山人海似的立在街頭，希望一看兇手遊街的情形。於此可推測報紙揭新聞對於社會上大多數人民影響的巨大了。如果在這時候，被有組織的不肖份子利用爲擾亂地方治安的工具，誠為不堪設想。照筆者的意見，報紙殊不宜發表此類案件，希望新聞檢查當局加以取締。</p>
<p>這種案件確是殘酷而非人道的，亟應加以嚴厲懲罰，但是，在初發生時候，如貿然發表，徒被一部份人利用爲牟利的機會，若干報章爲之攝影製版，甚至有若千小劇塲為之排演戲劇，非但浪費物資時間，最嚴重的後果，莫如給予無智識的人以不良的暗示—雖然犯了殺人罪還可出風頭，其影響是非常惡劣的。</p>
<p>筆者以為，這一類新聞如能在偵查完畢，經司法當局宣判定罪後，根據事實發表，那末不但不會給社會上如此不良的衝動，並且可使作惡的人知所警戒。其效果定比未經宣判前所發表的來得更大些</p>
<h3>本市縣政槪況</h3>
<p>— 譚庶潛</p>
<p>一·縣政管理處之組織</p>
<p>本市行政區域，在事變以前，僅有市區（包括今之郊區）；自事變以後，即將環繞市區之寶山·嘉定·崇明·申江（昔屬上海縣）·川沙·南匯·奉賢等七縣，由蘇省劃歸本市管轄。是以本市市政府，一面主管市政，同時又兼管縣政。惟在此二重任務之上，市府對於縣政部門，迄無專管機構存在，往往不無顧此失彼之處，且又各局處一律對縣行文，往往同一事件，有兩三局處主管，非但手續煩瑣，耗費時日，且亦管理分歧，事權不能集中，影響行政效率至鉅。以是市政府於本年三月一日成立縣政管理處，專司集中管理本市縣政之責。</p>
<p>縣政管理處之組織，除處長副處長外·設有秘書二人，助理秘書一人至二人，及四科。第二科主管文書·人事·事務；第二科主管民政·經濟·警政；第三科主管財政·建設·地政；第四科主管文化·敎育·社會福利·宣傳。此外幷設有專員視察及技術人員。</p>
<p>縣政管理處成立後之施政，除指導各縣推進各項行政外，幷擬具强化縣政實施綱要，呈經市政府核准施行。此外幷接管各縣警務行政，更於本月二十日召集各縣警察局長開警政談話會一次。要之，以增進各縣行政效率，改進各縣警政，督導各縣田賦征收實物，促進增產，推進敎育，提高縣政工作人員待遇，整飭官紀等，為施政重點。</p>
<p>二·「强化縣政實施綱要」</p>
<p>縣政管理處所擬几之「强化縣政實施綱耍」，業經呈由市政府核准實施。內容分為八部份；一為機構之强化，重在裁併不必要之附屬機構，及加强區長鄕鎭長之櫂責；二為人事之强化，重在訓練·考績·獎懲·以及盡忠職守；三為行文之强化，重在迅速與效果；四為民政之强化，重在官民合作，確實推進行政，整飭官紀、推廣民間事業，解除人民痛苦，（如肅淸烟毒及賭博之類），整飭兼理司法，五為財政之強化，重在確立縣財政基礎，實行田賦徵收實物，整理地方公款公產，安定農村金融，六爲建設之强化，重在修建公路橋樑，實行增產墾荒，以及提倡造林，推廣手工業，奠定農村經濟基礎；七為敎育之强化，重在加强學校敎育，增設鄕村小學，推廣普及敎育工作，培養師資，增進學生程度；八為治安之强化，重在整飭縣保安隊及警察風紀，肅淸地方隱匿匪類，確保地方治安，强化保甲及自醫團工作，保障良民安全。</p>
<p>三·各縣治安狀况</p>
<p>本市各縣，前以治安欠佳，曾經先後實行淸鄉，現淸鄉工作早經結東，治安情形尙屬良好。惟遠僻鄕村，仍不免有少數匪類隱匿，然在目前警備體制之下，無礙整個治安。</p>
<p>四·各縣財政狀况</p>
<p>本市各縣財政，在三十三年度田賦收入項下·經市政府規定，以百分之四十解市庫，百分之六十留縣充地方款。除行政費由市府發給外，警務及建設敎育事業，均在地方款內開支。此在大縣，較有餘裕，但在小縣，則感不足。是以本年度（三十四年度）市政府決定田賦改徵實物後，所有各縣財政，將悉由市府統收統支，（即各縣賦稅收入掃數解繳市庫，而各縣所有經臨兩費槪算。悉由市庫發給。）故各縣財政困難，自可迎刃而解。</p>
<p>本市各縣經濟生產，以農業生產為主。大約言之，其比率為棉七稻三，以是各縣產米大都不足，地方民食，除仰給蘇省食米供給外，尙需輔以麵粉及雜糧。目前各縣正加緊實施增產中，蔬菜增產，亦已列為增產之一部門，除以獎勵方法促進外，幷以時約農田增產方法辦理。</p>
<p>又各縣區在淸鄕時期所設置之封鎖棧，現以淸鄕工作完了，現正連絡撤除中，一俟準備竣事，即可正式廢除。</p>
<p>六·各縣警察待遇</p>
<p>各縣警察待遇，過去有數縣極低，如南匯川沙，每名警士月僅九十元左右。縣政管理處，於羅前兼處長時已考慮提高，與保安隊相等，即每一名警十除月給警米三斗外，幷有餉給四千餘元，此次警政談話會，亦已有所商定，現正呈請市府核示中，一俟核准，立即實施。</p>
<p>七·各縣與鄰近蘇省各縣間</p>
<p>之行政關係</p>
<p>本市各縣雖與蘇省相隣，然各縣實施各自法令，故在直接行政上與蘇省隣近各縣，無若何關係，惟在間接行政上，如有關交通之公路修建，有關治安之聯防會剿，仍相互間時有連絡。（編者按：作者為上海特別市縣政管理處副處長）</p>
<h3>模範保甲建設運動</h3>
<p>— 羅定</p>
<p>海軍警備區保甲事務所，爲謀民衆自治組織之模範化與健全化，特計劃推行「校範保甲建設實騐運動」，擬以局部實騐之所得成效，普遍推及全區，使之成為建設新中國·實施憲政之健全的基本組織。</p>
<p>該區現包括九區，每區多者有七·八十保，少者不足十保，全海軍保甲區共有人口七十餘萬。現擬於每區中指定三保作為模範保，現正在進行調查工作中，五月初常可實行，其期限以三個月為限。</p>
<p>組織方面設立「模範保甲建設實騐運動本部」為最高指導機構，採取委員制，由所長。主任秘書·各區長·課長·各區指導官·秘書爲委員，組織委員會，以所長爲委員長，主任秘書為副委員長。又為加强該運動之實踐，特在本部設立督導處，以主任秘書為責任者，下設處員，負責辦理。其事務有：　調查戶口；　主持尸長會議甲長會議；　徵收保甲費；　從事防空自警；　推進宣傳啓蒙相互扶助等工作。設立模範保甲建設實騐運動區部，作為各區執行機構。區委員會以區長為委員長，總務為副委員長，區職員為委員，由區長指導官秉承該部督導處之指示，指揮區職員分別處理督導處所掌管之各事項。</p>
<p>實騐區之工作如下：　確實召開戶長會議及甲長會議，並充分聽取及採納民衆意見；　作詳細之戶口調查，並切實徵收保甲費；　展開相互扶助之活動如消費合作，共同炊事，保甲農園及托兒所等；　注重實際工作及成效以求防空自警活動之理想化；　擴展宣傳·啓蒙·民衆敎育等運動之實際工作；　實行選舉甲長及保長。</p>
<p>其工作開展順序首先為指定各區之實騐保，調查實騐保之現况，指派祖任實騐工作者，樹立工作計劃，進行程序及方法等，於工作開始後並注重實際推動，以收實效。</p>
<p>海軍保甲區，其現有組織甚為完密，居民與當局之協力亦頗切實，所負之義務較多，保障亦多。保甲費自四月份起已重新規定：三房客每月一百元，二房東每月二百元，商店其門面一間者四百元，二間者六百元，三間者八百元，四間者一千元，工廠亦依其規模之大小分等級。防空工作居民亦頗努力，防空壕之挖掘已順利完成，自警團員之獻身於救援工作，尤起模範及領導作用，今後更可樹立學習榜樣。同時下情上達和上意下宣也是今後工作的重點，其餘互助工作，加强民衆敎育等，也都是將來施行憲政必不可少的初步工作，都非切實推進不可。</p>
<p>地理形勢</p>
<p>至於沖繩島全島的地理形勢，略如下述：</p>
<p>沖繩本島位於琉球羣島中央，為羣島中最大之島嶼亦為沖繩縣主要部分，長約一三五公里，寬最廣處約為三五公里，最狹處為五公里，島形狹長，周圍約四〇〇公里，面積一·二一一平方公里（包括小屬島）。島之北部（圓頭部），以古成層為主而構成山岳地帶，脊梁山脈自東北走向西南，格樹等亞熱帶植物繁茂，島上因少平地，人口聚集地點祗以狹隘之海岸及灣頭為限，主要道路沿東亞海岸而築。</p>
<p>島之南部（那霸·首里二市及中頭郡。島　郡大部分）為高度二百公尺以下之沼地，地質屬第三紀層，上或戴珊瑚石灰岩。河流短小，水量於降雨之際急增，平時極少。本島人口大部分集中此處，鐵路亦以此區為限。舊都首里市及那　市，位於此區中央。後者為縣政中心地，是為唯一港市，市面繁榮。其南之系滿町，漁業特盛。</p>
<p>前島沖繩縣島　郡慶良間列島之一，自東北至西南，狹長。周圍約八公里。東北有哈得（譯音）島，仲島等。全島叢生灌木。住民聚居東岸，幾全部從事漁業。</p>
<p>神山島位於那霸港北方約十一公里，為慶伊灝島（亦稱慶伊三嶼）最東之最爾小島。全島由石灰質砂礫而成，地勢平坦，阿旦樹茂盛。高潮時低處為海水淹沒，乃分為二島。（譯自四月四日每日新聞）</p>

<h3>遙祭</h3>
<p>— 伊萱</p>
<p>多少年來我都沒有想家了！我不敢想，我更怕於想，想起了家，我就不能不想起童年澀暖的家庭；我就不能不追悼愛我最深壯年死於斷病的父親；我就不能不　念白變蒼蒼倚閭切望的老母；我就不能不遙掛困在窮鄉掙扎的你們；我也不能不想起荒蕪的田園以及流離顛沛糊口四方的叔伯弟兄。想起了家我就有無限的凄凉！我不敢想，我怕於想，我巳有好久沒有想家了，</p>
<p>然而，這種强自壓制而內伏潛在的情感，一旦猝然爆發於一時，其為悲，為痛又往往超越於常情。</p>
<p>一年來，我知道你們病，我怕於接讓家書，我又盼望於接到家書，每次每次我反覆地看着家書，每次每次我都不禁淚之漕澘自下，因為我又想起了家，因為我更思念着你們。</p>
<p>大前年，我吐着盈盆的鮮血，前年我在一次痢疾一次斑疹傷寒後，又得肺炎侵潤症，不得已，我離開了友人，我拖着貧病之軀隻身跑到泳天雪地的北國調治，那時，我誠恐一旦客死，會留母親以「喪明之痛」會遺你們以「拆翼之悲」；誰知當我病體逐漸見好時竟聽到你們臥病經年的消息，誰知留母親以「喪明之痛」者是你們，遺我以「折翼之悲」者反是你們，誠誰知我回南來，反以病餘之身日日夜夜來哀思你們！</p>
<p>寬弟，在北國接到家書，知道你得喉T．B症，我曾大哭，我怕尼不能長留這世上，我怕此生我們已是長別，但沒有想到，在我返滬的第二天竟在流叔處得知你早已病逝半年，那時家裏猶在瞞我，我哭，但有何用？</p>
<p>一月前，胞弟來信才吿你逝訊，又述他自己病狀竟與你同，那時我在流落處捧書揮淚不能卒讀，書雖當塲我流叔焚却，然而。流叔業沒法減却我心頭的悲苦，我哭，我怕胞我胞弟病逝！我哭，但又何用！</p>
<p>八九年來，我們通着信，我們互相給與鼓勵，我們互相給與慰安，我們蘊存着萬干別情離緒，我們期待着浪跡四方的姐弟們有天能在家園團聚；而今我仍有萬語千言，却敎我何從向你們傾訴！</p>
<p>八九年來，我們都已長大成人，我思念你們，我沒法想像你們已長得怎樣高大，夢裏我見到的你們仍是十多歲蹦蹦跳跳的孩子。彷彿間我已忘了你們死去的這回事，我們仍和從前一樣談笑，不久，鷄鳴夢碎，天將曉的時候，却沒有了你們，這世界上是永遠也不會再有你們了！</p>
<p>寬弟，朐弟，在童年跟着父母，我們的足跡幾曾踏遍這古老的國度；在童年我們曾經合作過不少頑皮的故事；現在縱我跑遍天涯海角，又有誰能和我追證前塵，我只能在任何天眞頑皮孩子的稚氣裏我看到你們童年已逝的影子，每次我看到友人的弟弟，每次我却想起你們，甚至天天我對着街頭巷尾，弄堂裏的孩子，也都會勾起對你們的思念。</p>
<p>祖母死於肺病，父親死於肺病，十叔死於肺病，你們又相繼死於肺病。在這古老的國度裏體內潛有肺病菌者百之九十，而死於肺病者比比皆是。多少人掙扎在鐵寒陣綫上，因營養不足，疲勞過度，都望肺病道上走，多少人不知已得肺病任其蔓延傳染，多少人沒力量醫治而日迫近於死亡的邊緣，在這古老的國度，它是肺病菌撤遍的工作國地！</p>
<p>當我把凡生肺病者都想像作你們時，我的心，眞不能負載我的哀楚了！</p>
<p>我將怎樣用我滿懷的哀楚來遙祭遠方病逝的你們？</p>
<h3>別後</h3>
<p>— 史蒂</p>
<p>欲渾然忘去一切，我揮手於七弦琴底戰慄；別後的三個月。乃不留痕跡如自紙一頁。無人島非復人境。如今的世上也不再有樂土；欲渾忘一切是不可能的，林泉的幽語常賣我以往昔。虛驚於松濤十里，遂不再怪自已的緻細，旣如今沒一塊樂土，我也搗曁我經營的情會。三徑荒矣！　培的花草。沒等上今年的春風。却還待再過一冬。縱時兮不返。我也無所憾而生心，惟一切溫情是可感的，我將擁以　明春的雷。請再一返　塲鞭的騎士，這裏有我有我在向你們，這前途珍重！</p>
<h3>傷逝</h3>
<p>— 方正</p>
<p>牆角的虫嗚，代巷了稍頭的蟬噪；昨兒仿佛還是「赤日炎炎似火燒」，南了」！但貶眨眼又是「獨吊寒江雪」的時候；再待一忽兒竟到了「十里鶯啼綠映紅」的春天。時間的巨輪，總是這樣不停地旋轉着！</p>
<p>歲月催人老，是世間最最不能挽回的恨事。雖不工愁善感，但每對於季節的更易也免不了要黯然神傷。希望「春光長駐」「紅顏不老」，雖是人之恒情，但我們只能在書本上讀到霍桑博士的理想長生術「青春之液」，却不能喝到一滴不老之藥。那書中主角海德裘醫師說得好：「諸位老友！我一向在這醫室裏做實騐以自娛，現在很想請諸君帮助我做一個小小的實騐」。這無異告訴我們，返老還童那回事，僅不過在「實騐」罷了。假如我們眞去忘想喝「青春之液」，結果必是像被做實騐的四個老頭兒一般的失望與悲傷。否則「一世之雄」的曹孟德和「世界怪傑」的拿破崙，也不會讓人興「而今安在哉」之歡了！陸游詩：「百計不能逃白髮。」杜工部詩：「人生七十古來稀。」劉長卿詩：「顧影無如白髪何？」這種消極的詠吟，也無非是昔人感喟歲月匆匆的表示。本來在如此短促的人生裏，誰不有「浮生若夢，為權幾何」的感覺？只要瞧你對於已逝的韶光是否抓得住，「不負少年頭」纔好</p>
<p>由於季節的轉變，自己常相聯的　起疑問：「人生究竟是什麽？一當我讀到徐志摩氏的「契詢夫的墓國」，似乎得着一部份的解。他說：「人生究竟是什麽？你得加下你的按語，你得表示你的「觀」。陶淵明說：「大家在這一條水裏浮沉，總有一天浸沒在裏面，讓我今天趁南山風色好，多種一顆菊花，多喝一盃甜釀吧。」李太白，蘇東坡，陸放翁都回響說不錯。他們的「觀」就在酒盃裏的。古詩十九首中也常表示：一生一扯就過，不過也得過，想長生是傻子，抓住這現在盡量的享福尋快樂是眞。</p>
<p>嚴格地說，人們在世上都是無　伴的獨客，各個在他覺悟時，都是寂寞的靈魂。莊子也沒奈何這悠悠的光陰，他借重一筒枯髏，設想另一個宇宙，那邊生的進行不再受時間的制限了。古羅馬詩人霍雷士亦曾說：「人生者，自觀之者言之，則為一喜劇；自感之者言之，則又爲一悲劇也。」</p>
<p>有一天在路上遇着二年不晤的友人C君，從他舊衣敝履上瞧去，定是草草勞人，依然故我。我們歡然叙闊後，他告訴我最近有一樣很得意的事，原來他的尊夫人死了。悼亡不悲哀，反謂得意，我疑心他或許悲慟過度，得了神經病。正在懷疑，友人却大加解釋。說是在這活受罪的時代裏，一瞑不視，豈非也是幸福。這一番怪僻的言論，牢騷，驟聆之下，確是荒誕之極，但細細玩味，倒是有感而發；他可謂是陶靖節的忠實信徒。</p>
<p>這篇文章，拉雜寫到這裘，也該結束了，憶起千家詩裏，崔塗的一首「旅情」詩，那起句是「水流花謝兩無情」。可不是嗎？流水落花是無情的，別讓您的靑春，白白的消逝哪！您說是不？</p>
<h3>小卒</h3>
<p>— 白帆</p>
<p>甘心把隱忍當作一層糖衣，</p>
<p>包裏起過剩的感情。</p>
<p>濃膩的依戀原是可鄙的；</p>
<p>愛情——那多事的細腰蜂，</p>
<p>就讓它刺烈馬如刺素闌的心？</p>
<p>宇宙有無垠的遼闊，</p>
<p>辛酸是一滴露；</p>
<p>如果我已被命爲一名小卒，</p>
<p>斷臂折腿都不應一蹙眉；</p>
<p>失落盡的滿握溫柔，</p>
<p>又何必再回顧呢？</p>
<p>當默負起懷念如一粒灰塵，</p>
<p>踏上萬萬里不追悔的路程；</p>
<p>任泰山劈面崩摧，</p>
<p>啊，我沒有權利頓慄！</p>
<h3>感情的舒展</h3>
<p>— 蕭毅</p>
<p>近來我常常喜歡獨自倚在後門口，對着天邊凝望，轉些莫名其妙的念頭，不知為了甚麼緣故，就祇這樣覺得比較舒暢一些。</p>
<p>世上存在着很多痛苦的人們，他們往往把情感拘束怩忸起來，他們為了格於一種「世故」的假面具，他們不能任性地做自已喜歡做的事情，他們的理智和情感相互限制束縛起來而陷於痛苦的深淵，對於快樂的事情不能直率地笑，面對着悲哀的事情不能直率地哭，這是苦惱的悲哀。當我受到了委屈和痛苦的時候，我眞想獨自躲在一間屋子里痛痛快快地哭一場，讓憂悶隨着淚水淌去，尙去，我寗可明天帶着紅腫的眼睛讓人們去訕笑，我不願做一個痛苦內疚勉强的英雄。懂得找取適切的場合，讓情感天眞地舒展，一定能有着愉快的人生。正如我的凝望藍天暇思，雖然不含着任何目的，然而讓情感靈感縱橫聘馳會得到愉快。有時更會得到偉大的啓示，很多的事情的成功常啓端於悠閒中。我又常常感覺到過於忙碌格於事業規律的人生是痛古的負担，應該有着一些閒暇或者從忙裏抽出一些閒暇來悠閒地生活，護自已的情感滋育着，使自己的人性更趨於眞善美，這不是奢華的享樂和時間的浪費。記得高爾基在老年時在公園里對着一羣天眞的小孩他笑了，他慈藹地撫摩着他們，發自內心的高級的對人類的愛，試想陶醉於這樣愛情的橫溢中是件多麽崇高的舒適的事呀！</p>
<p>要得到情感舒展的享受，必需　意的是要求着絕對的天眞，一切矯揉造作或勉强模倣完全是束縛的工具，也就是說「美」的領域里需要「眞」。最後，聽音樂也是很能帮助情感舒展人性培養的好工具。</p>
<h3>斷篇</h3>
<p>— 胡生權</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>窗外是風，是雨，是雪；在屋內伴着我的，僅有自已的影子和一支搖的燭光。我靜靜地數着自已心房的跳動，似乎忘記了一切的情緒，歡笑不一定為了快活，悲泣何嘗是為了痛苦的綠故呢？</p>
<p>忽然，隔室傳來了孩子的哭聲，為什麼呢，這麽厲聲的銳叫？我立起身來，喊人抱過來，誰知道他圓睜着兩眼，面對着燭光笑了。</p>
<p>——哭笑無常的東西呵！我也禁不住笑了。</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>近來似乎生活得很悠閒，又似乎生活得很緊張；這惹起我許多友人的羨慕，惋惜和責難了。可是在自己呢，什麽也沒有計劃，做一日和尙撞一日鐘，在現在，有多少事可以由自己決定的？我不過在空閒的時候想忙些，在忙的時候想偷偷懶罷了。</p>
<p>有許多日子，眞是活得太無聊了。不想讀書，不想寫字，不想……，什麼都不想！於是把身子投到街上的人堆裏去，跟着人們慌慌張張的跑來跑去，偶然自己的脚跟別人的跛上了一下，就面紅氣緊地把事情弄得很「緊張」了。</p>
<p>「你是去搶火的？」</p>
<p>「你是去搶火的！」</p>
<p>「你是去報喪的？」</p>
<p>「你是去報喪的！」</p>
<p>如果每天沒有這樣吵吵鬧鬧，在人間的生活中，不是更顯出沒有生氣了麽？</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>好久好久日子以來，我學會了嘆氣。「為什麽要這樣長吁短嘆呢？」當有人問我的時候，我只能含糊地搖搖頭，我回答不出理由來，我覺得要「唉」一下，便不由自主地「唉」出來了。</p>
<p>有許多好心眼的朋友都關心着我的健康，說老是這樣嘆氣，對於我的身體是很不利的。我的母親也為這件事担起憂來了，說是老是長吁短嘆和家運的興衰也是有關的。於是我常常下意識的把在喉頭的「唉」噎到肚皮裏去了</p>
<p>然而我却一天一天消瘦起來了。對着鏡子我流下淚來，——這世界是適宜於嘆氣的，而偏不能嘆氣，我是多麼渺小的一個呵！</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>隨着風雪，春天畢竟來了。在去年，也是這麽一個月夜裏，我喝醉了酒。坐在我傍邊的一位友人，忽然雅興勃發，要寫起詩來了。我是一個俗人，對於琴棋書畫以及詩詞之類都是外行，但是經過他一再催促，再仗着一些　力，居然也完成了一篇匿名其妙的七古。其中有四句：「愁緒亦如萬綠濃，潦倒有何好朋從，醒來舞劍醉來睡，我是南陽一臥龍。」誰知竟使他生起氣來了，說我「不自嗚謙，妄擬昔賢」，從他一封滿是「之乎老也」的信中看來，我眞成了一個罪大不赦的人了。這使我感到好笑，固然我是太輕狂了，但是一個雅人僅有這樣的器量，還成一種樣子麽？</p>
<p>現在，春天又來了。我還是從前的我，除了多嘆氣外，迎牢騷都不敢濫發了。</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>我不諱言自己的驕傲，眞懶得把靑眼轉到那些浮囂的俗子身上。然而，在失眠的夜裏，我忽然估計起自已來了，「我是什麽東西？」我從床上跳了起來，我是比別人缺點更多，我是更要不得的一個</p>
<p>——去吧，你這無用的東西！</p>
<p>我對自已叱駡着。但是有什麽用呢，另一個「我」在冷笑着：「你罵我，我——就是你呀！」</p>
<p>、最近，我連自己都看不上眼了。我覺得我沒有理由來寬恕自已，而可責別人。</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>一問很喜歡多事的我，突然像哲人似的寗靜下來，引起許多友人的驚奇。「××變了，消沉得有些落伍了。」我聽見他們這樣暗中嘆息着，我的心隱隱地感到痛起來了。</p>
<p>我還不是很年靑麽，我的品管裏流動着的還不是跟別人一樣年靑的鮮紅的血液麽？然而為什麽我的心靈會這樣衰老呢？我也曾好幾次詰問着自已，在我的心裏喊出那樣呼聲</p>
<p>——饒饒我吧，我不能回答你！</p>
<p>我記得有一個醫師曾經替一個病入膏盲的病人開過這樣的一張藥方：Fresh　air　and　sunlight我也許需要一張同樣適一宜我病症的藥方，現在，我期待着，期待着那張回復我靑春活力的藥方！沖繩本島南部形勢圖</p>
<p>敵美自三月二十五日開始在沖繩本島南部　　以來，瞬已月餘。經日軍奮勇迎擊後，敵軍始終侷促於上陸地點，如嘉手納·北谷·泡　·那　·首里·系滿·漢川等地區，無法進展。據日本大本營發表，自本月十九日敵軍開始總攻以迄二十三日止之五日間，判明敵軍損失如下：殺傷兵員六千餘人，擊毀鐵車八十輛，大砲十一門，此外擄獲軍需口無算。日軍此次所獲戰果，對於今後在沖強作戰之勝利，更能增強信念。</p>

<h3>排球季節將開始各路雄師積極備戰</h3>
<p>前奏曲三省友戰白隊</p>
<p>籃球季節已逝，精彩球賽，由三場慈善賽後消聲匿跡。足球聯賽亦已成尾聲，雖尙有幾塲精彩賽，終覺不得其時矣。適應時令之排球賽，勢將乘時而起。聞排球委員會定今日下午四時召開會議，商討進行辦法。唯本屆西靑中靑兩健身房之同時不能地用，則當局必轉向戶外塲地謀發展。茲探悉各路雄師，正在積極準備中，以圖屆時有良佳之表演。</p>
<p>回　上屆稱霸者，甲組為粵華，乙組為永三，女子為綠隊。以上三隊，均有最佳之成績。茲聞永三隊有再接再厲之決心參加甲組以謀深造外，粵華則待主持人着錫庚之決定。女子組綠隊有退隱之說。蓋該隊有隊員數人，結婚後不再顯身手。且亦有退讓後起之意。待聯賽冠軍產生後，乃與之作一表演賽。目下正在操練之隊，介紹於下：</p>
<p>中北隊</p>
<p>中北隊自汪仲陶主持以來，生氣勃勃。唯僅有籃球隊組織而已。本屆公開籃球該隊獲甲組及乙組兩項冠軍，以是汪氏對球類運動之興趣更濃，遂右組織排球隊之意。共籃球隊中有排球身手者，有李震中·李寳中·陳學崇。卓國榮等。又以寳中與學崇之左右相殺，允稱海上兩絕。查其隊員，終覺力有不足。乃聞粵華不繼續舉辦，則球員有歸隸中北之可能，頃聞已在進行接洽，大致可望成為事實。果爾，則該隊實力雄厚，可稱霸本屆聯賽。</p>
<p>三省隊</p>
<p>三省男子排球隊成立消息，上期本刋已披露。茲悉該隊已正式成立，組織嚴密。所延指導戚公，為排球界先輩，經騐與學識俱佳。其隊員大部為上屆乙組總亞軍頤中隊之人馬。查頤中上屆在乙組中屢克强旅，直至最後總決賽時，以極近之比數，敗於永三，屈居人後。但觀其演出，殊稱上乘。此番旣得名師指導，定能更上一層。聞該隊決加入甲組，雖並無雄心，但予人滿意，自在意中。該隊名單，抄錄如後：</p>
<p>（領隊）潘三省，（指導）戚公，（管理）鄧效良，（隊長）張四維，（隊員）程義鴻·陳效平·林申·謝富能·黃宏道·熊大續·張伯柔·唐亮孫·陳嘉猷·陳澤東·姚文彝。</p>
<p>白隊</p>
<p>白隊在排球壇上有十年以上之歷史。其戰績始終維持在水平綫上。蓋該隊素具藉運動以消遺及鍛鍊體格為主，初無任何雄心。其不能登峯造極，亦以此故。本届該隊際此季初，又現活躍，開始練習。隊長汪德元表示，仍召集全班舊部參加聯賽，以顯白隊在排球賽中之無上精神。</p>
<p>冬靑隊</p>
<p>查女子隊，綠隊旣有退隱之說，志騫亦有渙散情形，西靑紅難望成軍，則上屆名單中，將僅有三省華嚴兩隊，不免冷落。但望新興後起，踴躍參加，共襄盛舉，不負當局之苦心。茲消息傳來，有冬靑女子排球隊崛起。其中有張璧如·王金鳳·劉祖信等知名之士。張豐如為前務本台柱，曾出席遠東，與黃杏芬等當年威風，猶在我人腦際。唯年來張小姐專心教育，不彈此調已久。此番東山再起，不識究屬如何。劉祖信係兩江名將，固亦十餘年前之老將也。劉小姐向為體育指導，門牆桃李，已遍各地。對排球始終興趣不滅，故球藝仍不减當年。尙有王金鳳，自在薇薇女排中顯頭角後，不見其芳躍久矣。王小姐三排托球之佳，素為筆者最折服。可謂至目下為止，尙無新將能與之比擬。此番再顯身手，必可使球迷得到最佳之印象。該隊有此三老將，益以劉祖信之高足，成績當可不弱。唯筆者曾與上列三位晤談，據悉該隊純為强身目的，或不預備參加聯賽。筆者鑒於木屆女子排球隊之冷落，故竭力促該隊參加。聞該隊正在考慮中。</p>
<p>下週一聯賽前奏曲三省戰白隊</p>
<p>三省隊為試探實力起見，特約白隊於下週一（四月三十日）假安福路省廳球塲作友誼賽。兩隊實力，前文中已略為介紹。在本季兩隊處女賽，自能受人歡迎。况省廳環境幽美，球塲四週，樹木成蔭，値此春日，球迷旣有球看，且能享受遊園之樂，誠實惠事也。想省廬主人，當能公開歡迎參觀，以示提倡。（貝）</p>
<h3>足籃球尾聲中聯會與裁判比賽</h3>
<p>足球聯賽，以明日東華棄權，甲組賽將僅有聯誼與葡商之一塲決鬥矣。上届在結束時有足聯會與裁判隊之聯歡賽，以示封廂大吉。一年一度，本届之聯歡賽，已決定於明日下午三時在膠州公園舉行。比賽着重興趣，球藝尙屬其次也。兩軍正式陣容，業經公佈。　　足聯會</p>
<p>周家騏　李寗　莊友仁　高山忠雄　馬山兒　蔣益門　蒙諾　玄正杜　沈嗣良　史的根　程貽澤　　裁判隊　　何春暉　鄂森　吳守衡　金家標　王守方　胡承銓　呂菖馥　張樂　黃逢佳　李關雄　王文義</p>
<p>足球　明日膠園兩隊角逐</p>
<p>觀上列名單，兩隊但屬知名之士，但類多垂老之年，恐無支持全賽之能力，故兩隊預備員極多。裁判隊有二十人以上，可謂洋洋乎大觀。上屆裁判以二對一小勝，此番足聯會復仇心切，且有李甯·莊友仁·馬山兒之助陣，後防可稱鞏固，紙須視前綫之努力而收勝利。裁判隊南得新人黃逢佳等，　能抵抗，否則必敗無疑。總之，此賽有聯歡之意，在球迷則趨重興味，熱鬧盛况，定可預卜。</p>
<p>籃球　乙組總決加入表演</p>
<p>籃球聯賽，目下僅有乙組各部正在進行中，且亦將於最近緖東。將來各部冠軍產生後，尙須作循環決賽。茲悉於最後總決賽時，聯賽當局，亦預備以籃球聯會與裁判會作一塲插曲。</p>
<p>本籃聯老爺軍名單，有注仲陶·戴昌齡·周家騏·張　祥·錢旭滄·鳥承　·沈昆南·凌希陶·林作時等。其中汪仲陶張　祥錢旭滄，素來馳駒球塲，老將風度典型尙存，實力未可小覷。裁判隊名單中，有王守方·兪菊　·金家標·陳寳琳·楊烈誠·鄭志芳·金伯陶·周懷邦·王立舞·黃存瑞等。較　聯老爺軍似為有為。周懷邦係上海銀行籃球隊全盛時代之行代表。金家標此中好手，金伯陶黃存瑞身手不凡。諭實力，與籃聯老爺堪稱相彷，論氣，充沛得多。日後相逢時，獲勝亦全賴乎此。（望端）</p>
<h3>籃球裁判者宿張國勳</h3>
<p>籃球名裁判張國勳君在十數年前的籃球界中曾煊赫過一時，他對於足球裁判也有相當的造詣。因為在一次震旦對樂羣足球賽中，稍起衝突，以後就專任籃球裁判，戰後脫離籃球界。他執法裁判，不偏心不失察，因此觀衆球員變方對他都有好感。張君現年四十九歲，係滬江大學出身，英文程度極佳。營商之暇，兼英文報體育編輯，後主編本埠新聞。三年餘來，絕少與體育界往來。近悉渠在投範中學執敎。（祚祚）</p>
<h3>明日東聯大戰東華宣吿棄權</h3>
<p>足球聯賽，明日本有甲組一幕，東華與聯誼對壘。按兩隊為華隊兩巨頭，自可有一番吸引力，　兩隊極鮮相逢機會。猶　上屆東聯大戰，膠州園內造成空前盛況。茲者旣有此良緣，球迷自必樂於欣賞。惟觀目下形勢表，東華遭三敗。對於錦標，已告絕望。而聯誼則以一和德商，再和滬警。兩和之戰績與葡商一敗（敗於僑聯）並列首應。而聯葡雖曾相逢，以秩序關係，未得圓滿結果。現當局准予重賽，故聯誼尙有希望。雖以吳瞿之被黜，但該隊人材濟濟，調整有方，未必稍減實力。益以邇來練習甚殷，定必大有可為。在如是情形之下，東華當局以鑒於本屆各項錦標，盡成夷人天下，惟此聯賽之中，我華隊聯誼隊有此一綫希望。再在東華地位，確可情讓於聯誼作最後之努力，以為我華人爭光。而事實上，東華勝聯誼，固無多大裨益。設若失敗，更屬多此一舉。雖然，球賽目的，並不在此。但以情理而言，稍北運動宗旨，亦無不可。故　華　權之說，由傳說而已成事實。</p>
<p>昨日東華書記莊友仁有正式函件致足聯會當局，表示明日東華已決定　權，使聯誼坐獲其成，乃與葡商作最後之爭鬥。惟望聯誼益加努力，不負東華此番好意。</p>
<h3>白馬杯賽延期</h3>

<h3>籃球學理述要（十七）</h3>
<p>— 梁兆安</p>
<p>查五人分區聯防法，有其利亦有其弊。其有利方面，為節省氣力，使敵不易深入，減少敵近籃投進機會，可以抵抗敵人用阻擋法進攻，可居間奪球較多，而又可迅速反攻，尤其是在遮板彈回之球。然其弊處亦復不少：　一人在一區內，難籃守二敵人，若敵同時有三人衝進，則陣綫易陷混亂。　不能强迫對方進攻。若在對方獲分較高，比賽時間無幾時，敵可在外圈傳球，不再進攻，以待時問告終，獲取數分勝利，在此情形，即觀衆亦大感乏味。　遇場地太大則不易退守，易被對方急行快攻。遇塲地過小，則不易防止敵方遠投。</p>
<p>故採用五人分區聯防法，必要先明其利弊之處，然後善為運用之，方始生效。對於個防守技術，為配合此種防守法起見，不能不加以注意下列各點。　在失球時，五人即須迅速退守，不能稍有疏忽意慢之處，免為敵方所乘。　防守時，看球不看人，適與「人釘人」防守法相反。　視球來之方向，預為移轉陣綫，幷互相呼應，以免誤會職責，錯亂陣綫，或行三重聯防，以制敵之集中猛擊。</p>

<h3>Japanese Special Attack Units Continue Fierce Attacks; Sink Three Enemy Warships; Fierce Land Battles Unfold on Okinawa Island</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Enemy forces in the southern region of Okinawa, in coordination with naval gunfire, concentrated artillery fire on the central highlands area from around 6:00 AM on the 26th. Around 10:00 AM, they deployed powerful tank units, gradually advancing on various fronts including Nakama (1 kilometer southwest of Sashiki), Maeda (1.5 kilometers south of Gushikawa), and Kouchi (30 kilometers south of Gokokufu), engaging Japanese forces in the area. Enemy activity was subdued on other battle lines, seemingly in preparation for further attacks. Simultaneously, Japanese special attack units continued fierce attacks on enemy warship groups, sinking three vessels of unspecified type. At 2:20 PM, intense anti-aircraft fire was visible around the Kerama Islands. After 4:00 PM, heavy anti-aircraft fire also erupted around the northern and central airfields, providing a glimpse of the ferocity of the Japanese attacks.</p>
<h3>Director-General Shimomura Broadcasts: Victory in the Battle of Okinawa Is Certain; Urges One Hundred Million Citizens to Rise Up in a General Offensive</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Director-General of the Japanese Information Bureau, Hiroshi Shimomura, broadcast on the radio at 7:00 PM on the 27th, under the title "Surpassing Okinawa," to clarify the government's information propaganda policy. He also explained how the Japanese people should respond to the current war situation, calling on the entire nation to rise up. The key points are as follows: Currently, there are various opinions and hopes regarding the government, the most common of which are the following two: We, the people, are prepared and will not panic no matter what happens. Therefore, we hope the authorities will clarify the true facts. We do not know what else to do. We hope the government will issue clear directives to guide the people's path. Regarding the first point, I also agree. Under the current circumstances, no matter how one argues, the unfavorable situation is indeed a fact. Since the fall of Saipan, Iwo Jima has also fallen into enemy hands. The Japanese mainland has also been subjected to enemy air raids. This current state is not optimistic. Therefore, all facts must be made public. Otherwise, rumors will spread. Therefore, the extent of damage from recent air raids has been published in detail to the extent possible. As for the second point, encouraging morale, increasing production of weapons, securing food supplies, and defending the homeland are all being actively promoted. From now on, the emphasis will be on how to implement these measures vigorously. Prime Minister Suzuki once said, "This cabinet does not need to advocate new slogans. There is only one thing: war. And in war, there is only victory." Currently, the battle of Okinawa is imminent. Of course, the battle of Okinawa cannot determine the final victory or defeat between Japan and the United States. However, after the fall of Saipan and Iwo Jima, what will be the result? Now that Okinawa has fallen into enemy hands, the enemy has not only acquired a powerful base to attack Japan, but also threatens Japan's maritime communications with the mainland. Thinking about this, we must defend Okinawa. Up to today's battle records, the United States also admits that Japan has the advantage. Although Japan will inevitably suffer considerable sacrifices, the losses of enemy aircraft and warships are significantly greater than those of Japan. Therefore, we should produce one more aircraft and send one more aircraft to the front lines. However, increasing aircraft production cannot be achieved solely through the efforts of factories. It requires the supply of a large number of materials from all aspects to be effective. To give one example, salt is a necessary raw material for manufacturing bombs. This salt must be shipped from Manchuria and North China. However, today, ships are scarce, and they must avoid air raids and mines, resulting in unexpectedly slow ship movements. Even if ships arrive in port, unloading cargo also takes a considerable amount of time. In the south, where enemy attacks are frequent, everyone on board, on land, officers or soldiers, must work together to transport goods. What normally takes two or three days must be completed in a few hours. Those who transport these goods may not know how closely related the salt they are carrying is to the Okinawa campaign. Therefore, they may not be able to maximize their efforts. If they could communicate with each other and understand the actual situation, the transportation would be even faster. The same is true for land transportation. If materials are transported to factories, and railways can exert their maximum effort and not delay in any way, it will add significant strength to the Okinawa campaign. Today is not the time for empty debates. There should be absolutely no more criticism, or shirking responsibility, or mutual arguments. All our citizens should abandon all selfish thoughts, reflect on themselves, cooperate sincerely, and dedicate themselves with a sense of determination. Today, the front lines and the rear must be united. With a sense of determination, bring together all our strength to respond to the Okinawa campaign. Responding to the struggle of the soldiers and officers of the general special attack forces, as well as the islanders there, one hundred million citizens should rise up in a general offensive. Then the divine land will not perish, and the completion of the Greater East Asia War can be expected.</p>
<h3>Interview with Foreign Correspondents</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Director-General of the Japanese Information Bureau, Shimomura, met with foreign correspondents on the afternoon of the 26th and answered the following questions:</p>
<p>Question: What is the reaction of the Japanese people to enemy air raids?</p>
<p>Answer: The emotions of the victims are no different from usual. Their spirits and bodies are also very refreshed, and they look forward to a comeback in the future. From the circumstances at the time and personal inspections of the burnt ruins, it can be asserted that the enemy's bombing of shrines and temples was planned. The enemy will bomb Tokyo's Meiji Shrine, Asakusa Kannon, Kobe's Minatogawa Shrine, and other places that the Japanese consider sacred. These facts, on the contrary, are intended to stir up the Japanese people's hostility towards the enemy.</p>
<p>Question: All newspapers say that the Okinawa operation is a decisive battle. Do the Japanese people recognize this fact?</p>
<p>Answer: All Japanese citizens fully recognize the importance of the Okinawa operation and are well aware that if Okinawa is attacked after Iwo Jima is seized by the enemy, it will be threatened.</p>
<p>Question: What do the Japanese people think of the German resistance?</p>
<p>Answer: The Japanese people have the same feelings as the people of all countries in the world. They believe that the German resistance is truly amazing. The German people all have a fighting spirit, and we believe that this fighting spirit of the German army will continue to be displayed in the future.</p>
<h3>Army Ministry Announces: Awarding of Letters of Commendation to Brave Soldiers; Lieutenant Hirai and 15 Others</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Japanese Army Ministry recently announced that sixteen brave soldiers, including Lieutenant Toshimitsu Hirai of the Special Attack Flying Corps, Second Lieutenants Hajime Takasu, Taku Miyamizu, Katsuyoshi Yoshimoto, Kunitaka Musukoda, and Takuzo Nishio, participated in the battle in the Nansei Islands area, carried out heroic ramming attacks on enemy warships, and established special achievements. They were awarded letters of commendation, and it was reported to the Emperor.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Attack Kyushu and Taiwan in Batches</h3>
<p>Fukuoka, 27th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Because of the severe attacks by the Japanese special attack units, the enemy dispatched B-29 aircraft from the Mariana Islands base to carry out strategic bombing. On the 26th, they attacked the Kyushu and Yamaguchi areas, and again on the morning of the 27th around 8:00 AM, they attacked the southern Kyushu area in two batches. The main force of about 100 B-29 aircraft invaded from the Satsuma and Osumi peninsulas. Another part, about 50 aircraft, invaded from the Bungo Channel, targeting the airfields around Izumi, Miyakonojo, and Kanoya as the main targets for bombing. After 10:00 AM, they fled towards the southeastern sea. Japanese damage was minor.</p>
<p>Taipei, 27th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - About 50 enemy bombers and more than 10 fighters from the Philippine Islands base attacked the Kaohsiung and Tainan areas on the 26th, strafing cities and villages with machine guns. Around 3:00 PM that afternoon, they fled to the south. Around 2:00 PM that day, one or two large aircraft dropped bombs on the area and fled.</p>
<p>Southwest Pacific Base, 27th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - In the Makassar area, more than 30 enemy aircraft attacked during the daytime on the 25th. More than 30 aircraft continued to attack during the daytime on the 26th. On the morning of the 25th, more than 10 B-24 aircraft attacked Pomala, Celebes Island. Japanese troops there shot down two of them.</p>
<h3>Japanese Air Force Active in Burma, Sorties Day and Night to Strike Enemy Forces</h3>
<p>Burma Front, 27th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Japanese Air Force in Burma, in cooperation with ground forces, cooperated daily to deal a major blow to enemy air forces advancing south along the Mandalay road. On the 22nd, a night bombing squadron was dispatched to urgently attack an enemy vehicle column advancing south northeast of Pyinmana, with three vehicles hit and set on fire. On the morning of the 23rd, a Japanese fighter squadron strafed the Pyinmana South airfield and the surrounding vehicle column with machine guns, setting two gliders on fire and destroying five. In addition, about 60 vehicles were destroyed. On the morning of the 24th, the fighter squadron attacked the enemy armor unit in the Toungoo area, destroying 120 vehicles and shooting down a Spitfire fighter. One place at the Toungoo North airfield caught fire. Japanese losses were only one aircraft that did not return.</p>
<h3>Saigon Under Air Raids for Consecutive Days</h3>
<p>Saigon, 26th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Since eight B-24 bombers from the Philippine Islands Southwest base attacked Saigon on the 19th, they have flown to southern Vietnam for air raids for consecutive days, namely about 30 B-24 and P-38 fighters on the 20th, 10 B-24s on the 22nd, 30 fighter-bombers on the 23rd, 40 on the 24th, and 52 on the 26th, all dropping bombs in the Saigon and Cho Lon areas.</p>
<h3>Su Yuan Organizes Refugee Relief Association</h3>
<p>Suzhou, 27th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Considering that the provincial capital area of Suzhou is densely populated, and if disasters such as air raids occur during wartime, they will have a huge impact on public security, the Jiangsu Provincial Government has organized the Provincial Capital Refugee Relief Association as a preventative measure. They have already sent letters to local gentry to serve as preparatory members and are actively preparing.</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of New Huaihai (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Yi Fei</p>
<p>Educational and Cultural Undertakings</p>
<p>Education in Huaihai Province is still far from ideal. Taking Xuzhou City, the provincial capital, as an example, there are currently only three middle schools, seventeen complete primary schools, ten junior primary schools, six private primary schools, and one people's education center, with a total of more than 14,000 primary and middle school students. Due to the shortage of classrooms, students are divided into two shifts each day, attending school in turn in the afternoon. Furthermore, there are an estimated 44,000 school-age children in the city. In comparison, the current number of university children is about 30,000. The situation is indeed serious. Governor Hao, in addition to starting last month to establish a "Local Education Business Committee" in Xuzhou City, inviting local gentry and prominent merchants to jointly support the endeavor, also convened a Huaihai Education Conference on March 14 in the provincial government auditorium to comprehensively plan and listen to reports from education workers in various counties. A total of twenty units, representing more than two hundred people, gathered together to discuss and study. During the conference, Hao himself delivered a speech, explaining the main purpose of Huaihai's future education promotion, and providing many instructions on current important issues. He also inspired the representatives to "complete the great cause of saving the country and the people with simplicity and sincerity, correct oneself before correcting others, set an example for future teachers, endure hardship and work hard, broaden their minds, strengthen their aspirations, and set the goal of training young people for the future."</p>
<p>Because the Huaihai authorities attach great importance to education and cultural undertakings, cultural figures from Beijing, Shanghai, and other places are quite active here. The Huaihai branch of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association held a "Wartime Culture Symposium" on the 9th of the month, attended by more than fifty people from various cultural institutions, and the atmosphere was very enthusiastic. The meeting openly discussed all issues related to wartime culture and subsequently issued a "Wartime Cultural Construction Declaration" in order to arouse the cooperation of all parties.</p>
<p>In order to adapt to the decisive battle system and promote the basic policy of wartime cultural propaganda, the provincial government, in order to strive for the unification of publishing censorship agencies, convened representatives from relevant agencies on the 10th of the month to review the publishing censorship methods in the provincial capital. Afterwards, it was decided that the provincial government would establish a publishing censorship office to handle all matters related to the censorship and guidance of publications in the future, in order to promote the development of cultural undertakings in the province.</p>
<p>Construction and Industrial Movement</p>
<p>Allied Nation Cooperation Committee: In order to actively promote the province's construction movement, the Huaihai Provincial Government established the "Huaihai Provincial Construction Committee" in order to enlist knowledgeable people from official and civilian circles, concentrate the power of all levels of the party, government, military, and people, and promote this movement. A hundredth construction meeting was held in the provincial government on the 3rd of the month. Under the leadership of Governor Hao, a preliminary review of the work was carried out. Afterwards, powerful figures among the allied nation expatriates in Xuzhou City responded and enthusiastically donated large sums of money in order to jointly complete the construction of New Huaihai. The largest donation was from Mr. Shinichi Komiya of the "North China Tobacco Control Association," who donated one million yuan alone. Mr. Seiichi Kawabe donated 500,000 yuan, and Kinjo Movie Theater owner Shin Saburo also donated 3 million yuan. Currently, the Japanese expatriate side has established the "Allied Nation Cooperation Committee" to comprehensively promote this to expatriates.</p>
<p>Preparing for the Construction of Light Industry: The construction of light industry in Huaihai Province is also becoming increasingly intense. In addition to eagerly expecting large capitalists from Beijing, Shanghai, and other places to come to Huaihai to invest and establish factories, and relocate factories here, there is also an organization with special responsibilities, the "Industrial Development Association." Furthermore, in view of the importance of water sources for industrial development, the "Huaihai Provincial Well Company" was established to develop water sources as a preliminary preparation for plans to expand light industry. Previously, due to the lack of good prospecting machines, it was difficult to know the location of water sources, and the work could not proceed as smoothly as expected. Now, it has been properly arranged by the provincial government's economic advisor, Ogawa, and the "North China Development Company" to have the company's radio prospecting machine in Peiping come to Xuzhou to carry out the work. In addition to the more than ten wells that have already been completed, at a rate of six wells per month, the original plan to excavate the expected number of fifty wells should be completed entirely within the year. In the future, the water source problem can be easily solved.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in order to adapt to the needs of the current environment and to solve the problem of goods after the future industrial development, Huaihai Province recently established the "Huaihai Provincial Transportation Management Bureau" to strengthen the transportation organization in the province.</p>
<p>Agricultural Production Increase and Improvement</p>
<p>Huaihai Province is located at the intersection of the three provinces of Jiangsu, Henan, and Anhui, between central and northern China, and at the intersection of the Jinpu and Longhai lines. It is an important military, political, and economic town, with fertile land and abundant production. It is known as the "Chinese warehouse." Wheat is the main agricultural product. In addition to domestic consumption in the province, 500,000 tons can be surplus and supplied to North China annually. The Huaihai authorities are planning to make further efforts to promote increased wheat production. After repeated experiments, it has been proven that the "Huajia No. 6 seed" is most suitable for the soil quality of Huaihai. The province's "Seed Collection Station" is now responsible for breeding this seed, which will then be distributed to families in various counties for adoption, expanding the overall increase in wheat production. It is expected that there will be amazing results in the future. As for fertilization and other tasks, they are also being planned, and effective implementation measures will be taken soon.</p>
<p>The breeding of sweet potatoes is also being actively promoted. Japanese improved varieties are now being used to increase production. The cultivated area will be expanded to two million mu. The expected yield will exceed the local report by more than two times. This move will make a great contribution to the province's people's food and military raw materials.</p>
<p>The Huaihai authorities are sparing no effort in their work to reclaim wasteland. Currently, the first step is to investigate the wasteland on both sides of the Jinpu Railway line in the province. Approximately 10,000 mu have already been found, and methods for long-term reclamation are currently being studied.</p>
<p>Expansion of Cooperatives</p>
<p>Most of the residents of Huaihai are farmers. The managing director of the province's cooperative, Mr. Hongxian Ren, dispatched personnel to various counties in late March to inspect and urge the establishment of mutual aid societies in various counties in order to improve the lives of farmers.</p>
<p>In order to facilitate spring cultivation and small-scale business operations for landless farmers and small business people, the cooperative has launched short-term credit loans. All members can benefit from this. The method is handled by the loan department specially established within the cooperative, and the installment repayment method is adopted. The loan term is fifty days, and it is repaid in ten installments, once every five days. The loan amount is divided into four types: Type A is 5,000 yuan, Type B is 4,000 yuan, Type C is 3,000 yuan, and Type D is 2,000 yuan. The interest rate is five yuan per hundred yuan.</p>
<p>In the past, ration handbooks were distributed by the provincial cooperative to the county cooperative, and then from there to the village cooperative, and then to the farmer by the hand of the township chief. The procedures were complicated and abuses were inevitable. Therefore, before the incident, farmers in the countryside had not received the supplies distributed by the cooperative. Now, the staff of the cooperative is responsible for directly delivering them to the farmers, so there is no more exploitation and embezzlement as before. This move has won the support of the farmers and increased their faith in the cooperative. It is learned that the cooperative has further developed consumer cooperation. It has now raised a large sum of money to purchase daily necessities needed by farmers and transported them to various counties to sell them directly to farmers at low prices. At the same time, in order to reduce the difficulties for farmers in transporting and pricing their agricultural products for sale, the cooperative also handles the unified transportation and sale on their behalf, in order to lighten their burden. (The End)</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Specific Issues in Implementing Agricultural Loans</h3>
<p>Regarding guiding idle capital and salvaging Shanghai's socioeconomic crisis, we previously discussed restoring industrial production, establishing small daily-use goods factories in the interior, and implementing rural loans, respectively, especially regarding implementing agricultural loans, believing that it is most necessary to promote it in advance. Because if it can be successfully implemented in a planned and step-by-step manner, it can not only solve the increasingly serious problem of idle capital in the city, which is beneficial to the stability of the socioeconomic situation, but also, after idle capital is introduced into the hands of production farmers, it can also salvage the current crisis of agriculture being abandoned in the wild, promote increased agricultural production, and solve the most serious economic problems in urban and rural areas today. At the same time, it will also solve the increasingly serious social and political problems, making it impossible for the Communist Party, which is watching from the sidelines, to take the opportunity to act. On the 25th of this month, the Continental New Paper discussed "Rural Loans and Business Organizations," listing several specific issues of rural loans, which were extremely pertinent and focused. We believe that today's most urgent problem is how to quickly raise funds successfully?</p>
<p>In principle, since the implementation of agricultural loans has been unanimously approved by the Municipal Consultative Committee, it is imperative and there is no doubt. Because this move can not only show the Shanghai citizens' cooperation in the war and help rural areas increase production; but also provide relief to rural areas and prevent Communist incitement; and has important economic and political significance. In the future, increased agricultural production will also alleviate the city's most serious food problem. What we urgently need to do today is: Raise funds quickly, ensure that citizens thoroughly understand and automatically raise funds, and determine the method of loan principal and interest.</p>
<p>Regarding the specific method of agricultural loans, in order to achieve quick results, it is necessary to divide the labor and cooperate to divide the agricultural loan work into three major steps, namely, fundraising, lending, and repayment. Regarding fundraising, we believe that this is the basic responsibility of the people of Shanghai. For this step to be quickly successful, the mission of the people of Shanghai will be completed. If the time for fundraising feels pressing, it can be raised in phases. The target of fundraising should be based on the principle of those with money contributing money and those with strength contributing strength. Major companies, major firms, and factories that are still operating, as well as enthusiastic people who are devoted to social welfare, naturally cannot shirk their responsibility and should take the lead in advocating.</p>
<p>Regarding lending, if we set up our own institutions, hire experts to investigate and study, and implement it, it will take a long time. In order to meet the urgent needs of rural areas, it is more effective for the Jiangsu Provincial Government to handle it directly. Secondly, regarding the lending method, what farmers need for production does not necessarily have to be cash. Fertilizers, agricultural tools, seeds, etc. are also quite necessary. As for the target of lending, the basic principle is to directly enter the hands of production farmers. It is certainly permissible to target farmer groups (such as cooperatives), but whether cooperatives are truly organized by the farmers themselves is a prerequisite question, and the local government must choose based on the actual situation.</p>
<p>Regarding the repayment point, in principle, the following must be achieved: The repayment period cannot be too short, at the earliest after the new grain is harvested, because this poverty alleviation loan is not purely economic, but contains political significance. Although ensuring principal and interest is necessary, we also need to consider that the main purpose of Shanghai's implementation of agricultural loans is to alleviate the suffering of farmers in the Jiangsu rice-producing area and increase production, thereby regulating the food supply for Shanghai citizens. Therefore, the loan conditions do not need to be calculated in detail, but it is hoped that the Jiangsu Provincial Government can discuss with us the appropriate amount of surplus grain from various places to be borrowed and transported to Shanghai for fair and preferential sales, in order to achieve the original intention of mutual assistance and mutual benefit, which would be even more convenient for both parties. Time flies and the opportunity is pressing. It is hoped that the relevant parties and caring people will quickly take action to promote it and see its success as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Translated Article</p>
<h3>Rural Loans and Agricultural Organizations</h3>
<p>Introducing Shanghai's idle capital into rural areas, promoting increased agricultural production, and salvaging the Shanghai economy from the crisis of idle capital's wild movements is indeed a measure that achieves two goals with one action. This attempt will be gradually realized, which is indeed a gratifying phenomenon.</p>
<p>Introducing Shanghai's 500 million yuan of idle capital into rural areas is by no means an easy task. Even with the current inflation, the amount of 500 million yuan is still a huge sum of money. Therefore, both the loan planners and the money lenders must make extraordinary efforts and have a spirit of sacrifice. We hope that both sides can overcome difficulties and achieve the desired goals. The path to success for rural loans requires success in Shanghai first, raising funds, and at the same time, the local area also prepares the environment to accommodate it, so that the funds can be truly transferred to the hands of farmers.</p>
<p>There is no need to discuss again how farmers lack production funds. Because they lack production and living funds, they have no choice but to borrow money from landlords and usurers at alarmingly high interest rates, or sell green seedlings to overcome the current difficulties. If we let it go unchecked, not only will the farmers' economy be on the verge of bankruptcy, but agricultural production will also decrease sharply. Therefore, rural loans are indeed a method that simultaneously saves the farmers' economy and agricultural production. In order to speed up the completion, it is necessary to have good guidance that allows loan funds to flow into the hands of farmers completely and at low interest.</p>
<p>In the past, the China Bank, the Bank of Communications, the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, and the cooperatives before the incident handled agricultural loans. Judging from the experience before the incident, the agricultural loans they handled cannot be considered successful. Almost all of those who used agricultural loans were landlords, usurers, and cooperative cadres, who relended them to farmers to earn interest, while the conditions for farmers to become debt slaves were not improved in the slightest.</p>
<p>In order for agricultural loans to be perfectly effective, these middle-class exploiters must be excluded from the implementation process of lending. As for its method, we believe that it is nothing more than the expansion and use of farmer organizations. If rural loans are targeted at individuals, they will inevitably become high-interest loans. Only when organizations are targeted can this malpractice be overcome. This point can be confirmed by past experience. Therefore, it is no exaggeration to say that the expansion and utilization of farmer organizations is the only way to complete agricultural loans.</p>
<p>Among the farmer organizations after the incident, the most noteworthy are the cooperatives, especially the cooperatives in the "cleansing the villages" districts, which may be regarded as universal farmer organizations. If the organization of cooperatives in the "cleansing the villages" districts is strengthened, and the activities of production mutual aid societies and other lower-level organizations become more active, echoing Shanghai's agricultural loan movement, then agricultural loans can be smoothly realized. Of course, if the existing cooperatives want to comprehensively accept agricultural loan funds, there are still insufficient points in the organization. Therefore, both Shanghai's agricultural loan activists and those related to local cooperatives need to consider this together. (Translated from the Continental New Paper, April 25)</p>

<h3>Newly Appointed Governor Bao Discusses Governance Aspirations</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) - General Bao Wen-yue, Chief of Staff of the Military Affairs Commission, has been specially appointed as the Governor of Henan Province through the sixth National Defense Conference.

This has been approved by the Municipal Government and ordered to be implemented accordingly.</p>
<h3>Illegal Gold Transactions to be Reported to Ministry of Finance for Severe Punishment; Inspection of Stock Exchange Account Books Completed</h3>
<p>In view of the recent financial turbulence in the city, the financial authorities, suspecting that speculative merchants may be manipulating and profiting from the situation, ordered the Financial Affairs Inspection Office to conduct a thorough investigation in conjunction with the Economic Bureau.

<h3>Oil Merchants Selling Account Oil</h3>
<p>In order to meet the needs of the city's residents, the Unified Oil and Grain Distribution Office is actively preparing to distribute rationed oil as usual. However, the quantity of rationed oil needed is very large. It has been discussed with members of the Oil and Grain Trade Association to separately apportion the supply of registered stock oil. It is understood that a satisfactory result has been achieved, so the amount and price of this period's distribution can still be maintained at the original standard.</p>
<h3>Huazhong Hydropower Company Shanghai Electrical Branch</h3>
<p>— Jia Xi</p>
<p>—— One of the Analyses of Municipal Public Utilities in This City</p>
<p>Huazhong Hydropower Co., Ltd., Shanghai Electrical Branch, was reorganized from the military-managed Shanghai Electric Power Company in July of last year. The predecessor of the Shanghai Electric Power Company was the Shanghai Municipal Council Electricity Department, established in 1890. At that time, power was generated at the Feilen Road embankment near the Hongqiao area. The original power source was internal combustion engines, and the business scope was limited to supplying electric lights to users. Later, as Shanghai's industry and commerce became increasingly prosperous, and more factories used electricity as their power source, a new plant was built elsewhere in 1912, covering more than 300 acres, and equipped with boilers and steam turbine generators, burning steam as the power source for electricity generation. The amount of electricity generated also increased. At that time, there were about eight boilers and two generators in the plant. Later, they were gradually added, and the old plant on Feilen Road stopped generating electricity. In September 1928, the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council sold it to the American Electric Power Company for a price of 81 million yuan in order to raise funds for the redemption of public bonds, and it was renamed the Shanghai Electric Power Company. Among them, 80 million was obtained by the Municipal Council, and 1 million was for the pension and reserve funds of Western employees and the pension funds of Chinese employees. The Yangshupu New Plant has 30 boilers and 15 steam turbine generators, with a power generation capacity of over 190,000 kilowatts. Currently, the branch manager is Koshima Akira.</p>
<p>Organizational Structure</p>
<p>The administrative management of the Shanghai Electrical Branch is largely the same as that of the former Electric Power Company. Previously, the one who was in charge of command and decision-making was one President and one Vice President, followed by a General Manager and a Deputy General Manager. The Engineering Department and the Secretariat (i.e., General Affairs) are directly subordinate to them. The Engineering Department has one Chief Engineer and two Deputy Chief Engineers, and the three departments of Transmission, Feeder User Engineering, and Power Generation are directly under it, and the Purchasing Committee also belongs to it. The Power Generation Engineering Department and the Power Plant are in the New Plant, and the General Office of Transmission and Feeder Engineering is in the building on □□ Road. All installations, repairs, maintenance designs of high-voltage lines (divided into three types: 22000V from the power plant to the substation, 6600V from the substation to the distribution panel), and the distribution, laying, repair, maintenance, and other projects of low-voltage lines are all their responsibility. The departments under its jurisdiction include the Main Line Team, the Overhead Line Team, the Motor Room, the Electric Stove Room, and the Meter Room. The Main Line Team is the executive department for laying underground cable projects; the Overhead Line Team is the executor of overhead wires; the Motor Room is the department that repairs and inspects the motors in user factories, and manages and organizes the motors; the Electric Stove Room is the department that designs, installs, and repairs users' electric heating appliances; the Meter Room is the department that repairs, manages, installs, and inspects the electricity meters for the company's own use or for users, and is also responsible for inspecting users for stealing electricity, cutting off users' power supply, and connecting to the power supply; the Drafting Room (i.e., the Design Room) also directly reports to the Transmission and Feeder Engineering Department. The Purchasing Committee purchases small items directly from the warehouse, coal is the responsibility of the Chief Engineer, Power Plant Manager, and Fuel Chemist, and other insulating materials, electrical appliances, building materials, etc. are purchased directly by it. The departments directly under the User Engineering Department are the User Engineering Department, the User Relations Office, the Sample Room, and the User Payment Office. User Engineering is an organization that designs for users, estimates the amount of electricity used in various areas, solves users' difficulties, and investigates business.</p>
<p>Power Generation Procedure</p>
<p>The most important luxury items of the power plant project are the pump room, workshop, furnace room, electrical switch room, distribution panel, distribution room, etc., and the secondary items are the coal hoisting room and coal grinding room, oil pump room, and belt room.</p>
<p>Power generation work process: water is drawn from the pump room to supply the furnace room, and coal is transported from the lighter by the coal hoisting workshop to the belt room, and transferred to the furnace room as fuel. The high-heat and high-pressure steam is then guided to the workshop to drive the turbine and generator, and electricity is generated. After the voltage is regulated by the distribution room and the electrical switch is opened with electricity, the current passes through the distribution panel and switch to the busbar, and then opens the electrical switch of the feeder substation with electricity through the distribution room, and the task of transmitting electricity to the feeder substation is completed.</p>
<p>After the steam passes through the turbine, the exhaust gas must be condensed with cold water to turn it into water, and then pumped to the furnace room with a water pump. Because the temperature of the water is still high, the amount of coal used can be saved. Oil is used as an insulating material for the distribution panel, but because the temperature inside the distribution panel is quite high, for fear of losing the insulation effect, an oil pump room is set up to circulate the oil and cool it with water.

It is now learned that the Donghua Association notified the Football League in writing yesterday, through Secretary Zhuang Youren, declaring its automatic forfeiture of the match. Therefore, Friendly can win without effort. According to the current situation, Friendly and Portuguese Merchants are tied for first place, so the future Portuguese-Lian Great War is tantamount to fighting for the championship. The East-Lian Great War has become a mirage, and the future Portuguese-Lian match will surely satisfy the fans' viewing pleasure.</p>

<h3>Recent Work Overview of the Municipal Propaganda Office: Director Liu Reports at Press Conference</h3>
<p>The 14th press conference hosted by the Municipal Propaganda Office was held in the auditorium of the office at 10:30 AM on the 27th. Director Liu attended in person and answered the questions raised by reporters from various newspapers in detail. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Propaganda Work Actively Promoted</p>
<p>(Question) Since you took office, what has been the progress of the Propaganda Office's work? (Answer) It has been more than three months since I took office. After rectification, the internal work has become more standardized, and close contact has been established externally. As for the routine work, it is the guidance of large and small newspapers and the review of various dramas. The inspection of newspapers and magazines is jointly handled by our office and the Shanghai News Inspection Office, which belongs to the Propaganda Department. Films and radio broadcasts are also handled by the Film Inspection Committee and the Broadcasting Association, which belong to the Propaganda Department. Our office is only in a guiding position. In order to promote propaganda work, a dinner party is held once a week with the press department of the Japanese Embassy, and the press directors of both the Mingbang Army and Navy are invited to participate. At the same time, a Chinese press conference is held every week, and the directors of various bureaus of the Municipal Government are invited to attend to answer the questions raised by various newspapers in order to strengthen wartime propaganda. Today is the 14th time. In order to ensure the accuracy of the release of municipal news, our office previously drafted unified news release measures, which were approved by the Municipal Government. All municipal news will be released uniformly by our office. Regarding the guidance of newspapers, we have convened small newspaper managers to talk, instructing them to publish wartime news and municipal news, education ethics, strictly prohibit decadent and pornographic text, and urge them to organize a small newspaper federation, which will be formally established soon.</p>
<p>Handling of Key Supplies</p>
<p>(Question) How is the handling of key supplies for Chinese, Japanese, and third-country journalists in Shanghai? (Answer) According to regulations, key supplies for Chinese journalists are limited to editors, but I believe that the employees of the business department are also part of the newspaper and should enjoy this treatment. After consultation with the relevant parties, it has been changed to all newspaper employees, and all can apply for key supplies. Large newspapers will be reviewed by the Shanghai Branch of the News Association, and the number of employees of each newspaper will be reviewed by the preparatory personnel of the Small Newspaper Federation, and then sent to our office for verification and transfer to the Materials Allocation Office. Three periods have already been received. Chinese employees of third-country newspapers will also be verified and transferred by our office. Foreign employees can receive half a bag of flour per period, and Japanese employees of friendly newspapers will be allocated by the embassy.</p>
<p>(Question) What is the propaganda situation in various counties and districts? (Answer) Our office has recently sent a letter to the County Administration to order the counties and districts under its jurisdiction to report the recent propaganda situation for verification, so as to provide guidance separately based on the propaganda points issued by the Propaganda Department.</p>
<p>Eliminating Malpractices in Drama Review (Question) Can you tell us something about the work of drama review? (Answer) In order to eliminate various malpractices in the past in drama review, we have twice convened the persons in charge of Peking opera, spoken drama, Yue opera, Shen opera, and miscellaneous drama theaters to talk to us about complying with the inspection rules. Those who violate the rules will be warned, given a short-term suspension of performances, fined, or have their licenses revoked. The deadline for spoken dramas to be submitted for review is 20 days before the performance, and for others, it is one week. Our office will never make things difficult. In order to unify the authority to review dramas, we submitted a request to the Municipal Government for approval, and our office will handle it. The police department will assist. Since March, past accumulated coins have been eliminated, which has won some praise from the outside world. Regarding the review of foreign dramas and music, we have also submitted a request to the Municipal Government to order the police department to transfer it to our office for handling. In order to ensure accurate review of the content of dramas in the future, we have submitted a request for the establishment of a Drama Review Committee, with me serving as the chairman concurrently, the head of the Enterprise Section serving as the deputy chairman concurrently, senior staff members of our office as ex officio members, and people with experience in Chinese and foreign dramas as specially invited members.</p>
<p>Special Propaganda Activities to be Held One After Another (Question) How is your office implementing special propaganda? (Answer) Since I took office, special propaganda activities have been carried out, including the National Father's Death Anniversary and Afforestation Movement Conference, the celebration of the fifth anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital, and the United National Salvation Movement Mass Meeting. All of these were handled by our office. In the future, we plan to organize touring lectures and symposiums, celebrity broadcasts, and convene a Shanghai Municipality-affiliated counties and districts propaganda conference next month.</p>
<p>(Question) Regarding the case of Jiao Boquan's compliance with the law, the Shanghai branch of the Special Court has begun the investigation procedure. Can you tell us about the facts of the crime? (Answer) Before the verdict, it is not convenient to tell you.</p>
<p>(Question) The authorities have issued a strict ban on military police officers and civil servants who do not purchase tickets and force their way into theaters. However, the fundamental solution is to follow the example of the capital city and formulate preferential treatment measures, or add Sunday morning performances and provide free invitations, so that bad phenomena can be reduced. (Answer) Regarding the preferential treatment measures for theater viewing, our office will provide opinions within the possible scope and submit them to the Municipal Government for approval and then order them to be followed.</p>
<p>Bad Publications Included in the Review (Question) What is the situation of the review of comic books and serial pictures on the market? (Answer) This case is being handled. The Education Bureau has a review committee for cracking down on bad public reading materials. These comic books and novels are also included in the review department. In the future, we will review them together with the Education Bureau.</p>
<p>(Question) Music tea houses and Peking opera ticket offices are springing up like mushrooms after rain, which is an abnormal development in wartime Shanghai. What are your opinions on this from your office, which is in charge of cultural propaganda work? (Answer) Music tea houses and Peking opera ticket offices are indeed springing up like mushrooms after rain, as you all said. We are now registering them separately, and then submitting the adjustment measures to the Municipal Government for approval before implementing them in stages.</p>

<h3>Relief for Baoli and Jiao Ji Hospitals: Regular Charity Performance to Raise Funds</h3>
<p>Jiao Ji Hospital, located at 100 Wanzhufang Road, Nanshi, has been providing free medical treatment and medicine for eight years. It was originally established to treat residents of the refugee area in Nanshi. Now, all poor patients living in Nanshi can receive free treatment, and a small amount of supplies can be provided, or they can apply to charitable organizations for drug expenses. The necessary expenses in the past have been painstakingly maintained by the French charitable lottery and church organizations. In recent months, the charitable lottery has been announced to be suspended, and church organizations have stopped providing funds. The hospital's economic sources have been cut off, and the necessary expenses have increased with prices, so the expenses are insufficient and it is difficult to maintain. According to statistics, there are hundreds of thousands of residents in Nanshi, but there are very few well-equipped public and private hospitals. Especially in the Dadongmen area, which is east of the Huangpu River, south to Dongjiadu, and northwest to the Central Market, there is an urgent need for a public hospital. Therefore, the Baoli Hospital was initiated, and the address has already been determined, but the opening still depends on the fund. Both of these are urgent priorities.</p>
<p>After consulting with the drama community, it was decided to hold a charity performance of "Home" at the Jincheng Grand Theater at 4:00 PM on May 3rd and 4th, and the proceeds from the ticket sales will be used as operating expenses and fund. We hope that people from all walks of life will generously contribute their kindness and participate in the charity event. The sick and poor will be relieved of their suffering, and the healthy will benefit from physical and mental health. The merit is immeasurable. Ticket prices are divided into: honorary tickets of 50,000 yuan and 20,000 yuan. Ordinary tickets are divided into four types: 10,000 yuan, 5,000 yuan, 2,000 yuan, and 1,000 yuan. In addition to the honorary tickets being sold by the Social Service Department of the Shen Xin News, the remaining tickets can be pre-purchased at the Guotai Pharmacy in Baxianqiao.</p>

<h3>Record of Inspecting the Kyushu Fortress</h3>
<p>The enemy American forces have already landed on Okinawa Island. Under these war circumstances, I went to inspect the "Kyushu Fortress," a seemingly impenetrable defense against the landing on Okinawa Island.</p>
<p>Visiting the Unit Commander</p>
<p>Entering the guard post shielded by bamboo poles, a plaque hung at the entrance, bearing the words "Sworn to Be a Breakwater for the Pacific" written in the blood of the warriors of Saipan, similar to the words "Sworn to Kill the Enemy." This is a certain combat command post. The small forest is the sacred site of the descent of the heavenly grandson and the ancient ruins of a certain royal family's old city. Now, this sacred site is the "General Headquarters" for planning the killing of the enemy. The entire old city has been used as a fortress for modern warfare, with the old moats serving as operational routes. In addition, underground tunnel fortifications and connecting trenches are being dug day and night.</p>
<p>Electric lights have been installed in the underground barracks, and young soldiers are busily working. The intelligence room is filled with telephones, and signalmen are holding telephones, constantly prepared to relay messages.</p>
<p>Climbing to the uppermost level, this is the unit headquarters, also a semi-underground barracks. A unit commander said spiritedly:</p>
<p>"There is only one path to patriotism. During this period, we must absolutely protect our homeland. If the enemy dares to invade boldly, then we must all, men, women, young, and old, rise up together with the spirit of a suicide squad and fight the enemy to the death."</p>
<p>○○ Bay, at the southernmost tip of Kyushu, is serene and silent. Like a coastline interspersed with fortresses, the Chinzei area, overlooking the Pacific Ocean, is guarded by seemingly impregnable fortresses. Commander K of the unit expressed a firm sense of shared hatred for the enemy, saying:</p>
<p>"This area is the enemy's favorite sandy beach. The foreign devils can come from anywhere, no matter what. Therefore, we cannot fight according to ordinary tactics, establishing strongholds, defending trenches, fortifications, or castles. According to our neural warfare tactic that minimizes our own losses, we will carry out sneak attacks at night, boldly execute assaults, and must annihilate the last soldier of the enemy. Our soldiers are all very brave and very vigilant. If such soldiers carry out suicide squad-style assaults, I believe we are absolutely confident of success."</p>
<p>Finally, he added forcefully:</p>
<p>"The Japanese are impatient. This will not work in the current war; we must be calm to find a solution."</p>
<p>Countless horizontal tunnels that can accommodate all citizens are being dug into the mountainside. If enemy planes come to invade, these will become the best aerial breakwaters. If they come by land, all these trenches will become firing points, which can cooperate with certain fortresses to inflict painful blows on the enemy, so that the mouth of ○○ Bay will become the graveyard of the American devils.</p>
<p>Air Fortress: Passing through the tea plantations of the plateau, I went to visit the air fortress in southern Kyushu. "The buildings standing on the ground have gradually lost their modern appearance and have become antiques from the previous century. All the factory facilities attached to the base have been moved underground to work. A part of it has been completed." This is the valuable experience that Commander H gained in New Guinea.</p>
<p>Around the base, under the leadership and design of the brigade commander, and with the enthusiastic help of the local people, a 0-kilometer underground city is being built non-stop. The Labor Service Corps, schoolchildren, and ordinary people from nearby villages all expressed, "We must defend our base!" working desperately, truly working under the stars and moonlight. Even female workers came to participate in the work, and organized suicide squads, working day and night, and training hard every day. Following the guidance of the unit commander, the reporter walked along the mountain path of volcanic ash and inspected the construction project of the underground fortifications. This high trench is also the remains of an ancient castle. This trench, only in name, has already become a motor road. In the white and gray mountain, there is a large cave. Although it is gloomy and dark inside, people are constantly working. The unit commander thanked each of these people, saying, "Thank you for your hard work! Thank you for your hard work!"</p>
<p>"This is truly a great opportunity for Heaven to test us. We Japanese must strive for victory, even if we leave not a single blade of grass or tree." The unit commander expressed this resolutely.</p>
<p>Mountain Stronghold: I also went to visit a certain stronghold. This mountain is the highest, with a ridge extending far into the sea like undulating waves. All the mountainsides of this peak have been completely transformed into gun emplacements. Following a small path, treading on weeds, and walking toward a plum grove, I discovered the position. This is the ○○ cannon. Crawling into the ditch, I saw the ○○ cannon. At this time, two soldiers were carrying heavy material boxes up the mountain. We, who were not carrying anything, felt that this mountain road was very dangerous. Seeing the soldiers working so hard, I was truly moved. Not only did the brave soldiers do such hard work, but also at night, after the bodies exhausted from working overtime in the white daylight, they had to desperately undergo melee combat training. At the edge of the cliff, there is a flat ground that people cannot see. This is the position where they await the enemy's landing and fight to the death. Let the enemy come if they want! This is what all the brave soldiers are saying. (Translated from the Yomiuri Hochi, April 6th)</p>
<h3>Special Attack Force Training Center</h3>
<p>Formations of Zero fighters flew across the sky, like tangled silk, sometimes in straight lines, sometimes in curves. The silver wings flashed, reflecting the spring sunshine, and each aircraft danced wildly in the air at an unusually high speed. This is aerial combat training by a certain naval air corps. If aerial combat is so beautiful, then war must be a lot of fun.</p>
<p>Rumbling, one after another, they head towards the battle command post. Altitude × thousand, arriving in an instant. This is dive bombing training. Whining—the aircraft dives overhead, only fifty meters away, then suddenly lifts its nose again. Behind the windshield, there is a smiling face. They are all young officers who came from reserve student training.</p>
<p>This fighter squadron is filled with murderous intent. Today, when domestic air bases are being used as much as possible to annihilate the enemy, it is a good opportunity to leverage the strengths of the homeland air fortress in base operations, and it is natural that this combat base is filled with tension.</p>
<p>The enemy has begun to use the Iwo Jima airfield. A considerable number of B29s are gathering in the Mariana Islands. Moreover, they have landed on Okinawa Island. The war situation is becoming increasingly fierce, and its tragic and heroic nature can be described as a do-or-die battle. In aerial warfare that emphasizes speed and maneuverability, this base also participates in the conquest of the enemy forces on Nansei Islands, and to date, it has dispatched many special attack forces.</p>
<p>Aerial combat requires high-performance aircraft and highly adaptable and skillful aerial combat techniques. Because of this requirement, they are constantly sharpening their skills and training elite aerial warriors under rigorous training. The dormitory for officers who came from reserve student training originally had a sign that said "Student Dormitory," but recently, at some point, it has been changed to "Kamikaze Dormitory." Someone has even composed a magnificent Kamikaze song. In this "Kamikaze Dormitory," filled with the enthusiasm of the entire special attack force, their movements are more calm and quiet than before, and the military discipline within the dormitory is strict and orderly, forming an excellent atmosphere. In the Kamikaze Dormitory's air corps shrine, trainees are sure to worship several times a day, and this has become a new habit.</p>
<p>"We will soon be going to fight to the death. We have to study hard how to die." This lighthearted remark passed like a spring breeze through the willow branches. The people in the Kamikaze Dormitory, having received enthusiastic farewells from their compatriots at the Meiji Jingu Gaien and Ueno shrines, went to the front lines as students. Now, they are all lieutenants and second lieutenants, holding command positions and becoming authentic warriors.</p>
<p>From 7:00 AM to 2:00 PM, they conduct instrument flight training. On a certain day, the weather was clear, and the spring sun shone on them, making them feel languid. Wearing dark glasses, the trainees perform blind flight, relying solely on instruments. The Zero fighter they are piloting is a small, high-speed, and excellent aircraft. They grip the control stick tightly, cautiously and wholeheartedly piloting it, as this is their first time piloting a Zero fighter.</p>
<p>In front of the battle command post, filled with dust and sand, a group of people gathered. Among them were a lean and capable commander, a tough flight commander who had served as an air staff officer in Rabaul, and a flight squadron leader who was determined to turn enemy aircraft and warships into powder. They intently watched the aircraft flying overhead. A few days ago, when enemy small aircraft came to attack, this squadron of Zero fighters, under its glorious tradition, had piloted training Zero fighters—which had been allocated here specifically for training due to minor flaws—to launch a surprise attack from above the clouds on a formation of four Grumman aircraft, destroying three of them in one fell swoop. The instructor, Staff Sergeant A, was the one who established this feat. Under the influence of such a mentor, the trainees not only learned the highest combat techniques, but also cultivated a fearless spirit.</p>
<p>The weapon of the special attack force is training refined a hundred times! Training is combat, and combat is the entire aircraft carrying out special attacks! This base, which specializes in training special attack talent, is accumulating strong and fearless combat power. (Special Correspondent Mikami, translated from the Asahi Shimbun, April 5th)</p>
<h3>Explosive Weapons for Close-Range Combat</h3>
<p>Bayonet fighting, melee combat, is a method of decisive battle that the Japanese army, ready to die for their country, excels at. In this bloody battle where melee charges are launched everywhere, one cannot help but ask: What types of weapons are used in modern warfare for close-range combat? In addition to bayonets, pistols, rifles, and military swords, there are also hand grenades, hand-thrown explosive mines, and anti-tank weapons, grenade launchers, and flame bottles. Among these, explosives play the most important role. The following is a brief description of several weapons used by the Japanese army in close-range combat, for general reference.</p>
<p>Hand Grenade: This is a bomb that can be easily thrown by hand, also known as a hand-thrown bomb. The explosive used is picric acid. The explosive charge is about 50 watts, and the weight of the grenade is about 300 watts. The length of the grenade is about 10 cm, and the diameter is 5 cm. Its power, after a certain period of time (about four seconds), will cause it to explode, and the fragmentation is effective enough to kill or wound people and horses, with a range of 5 meters in radius.</p>
<p>With ordinary practice, it can be thrown about 30 meters. Before throwing, the safety device is removed, preparing for ignition. When the time comes, the fuse is ignited, and after confirming that it has been ignited, it is thrown immediately. However, it must be noted that its explosion time, as mentioned earlier, is about four seconds, so if one is a little slow, there is a risk of it exploding in one's hand. On the other hand, if it is thrown too early, there is fear that the enemy may pick it up and throw it back before it explodes. Furthermore, its effective radius is 5 meters. If the enemy is very close, one may end up getting blown up along with them, so caution is necessary.</p>
<p>Grenade Launcher: This is a handled tube carried by infantry, with a device for adjusting ignition and a dial for adjusting the throwing distance. The caliber is 50 mm, the total length is about 600 mm, the weight is 5 kg, and the maximum range is 700 meters. As for its use, one holds the grenade launcher, lies prone on the ground, places the hand grenade or other explosives inside the tube, and pulls the trigger to launch it. The throwing distance is determined by the angle of inclination of the tube and the amount of gunpowder. It is usually used by two soldiers, one is the shooter, and the other is the ammunition handler.</p>
<p>Hand-Thrown Anti-Tank Mine: This is an anti-tank weapon that maintains the durability of the explosive until it collides with tanks or other objects, at which point it explodes. To maintain durability, the explosive is also used in a special shape. Moreover, because the filling amount is limited, the explosive must be small in quantity but have a large explosive force. This type of hand-thrown anti-tank mine has sufficient destructive power against light vehicles, and its throwing distance is about 20 meters. In addition to anti-tank mines and anti-tank guns, flame bottles and adhesive explosive mines are also used in close-range combat against tanks.</p>
<p>Flame Bottle: A glass ball filled with explosives, with the outside coated with adhesive liquid, to make it adhere to the tank and explode.</p>
<p>Adhesive Explosive Mine: This is a device that uses magnetism to adhere to the tank and explode. The amount of explosive used is usually less than one kilogram, so its effect is not very great unless it is thrown within a close range of 5 meters to 10 meters. Moreover, it cannot target the thinner rear and upper parts of the tank and armored vehicle, so its destructive power is insufficient. In short, these explosive mines must approach the tank. Recently, the Germans and Soviets used rocket-style mines, which can be called the motorization of throwing. Izen</p>
<h3>Recent Conditions of Hygiene Facilities in This City</h3>
<p>— Yuan Junchang</p>
<p>——Speech Broadcasted on Shanghai Radio Yesterday——</p>
<p>Listeners, I am Yuan Junchang, the Director of the Bureau of Health of this city. Tonight, I would like to take this opportunity to report on several recent health administration matters in this city, and I hope that all our citizens will pay attention and assist, because these matters are related to national health and are also matters of vital interest to every citizen.</p>
<p>First, for this year's cholera prevention injections, the entire staff has been organized into six large teams: the Central Team, the Pudong Team, the Punan Team, the Puxi Team, the Pubei Team, and the Gaoqiao Team. Since the 20th of this month, we have begun to implement the injection work comprehensively. The estimated number of people to be injected in two phases is approximately six million. I hope that citizens will go to the nearest injection station to receive the injection and do not evade it. You must know that evading the injection will not only harm yourself, but also harm others. Because if you evade the injection and later get cholera, you will spread it to others who have not been injected. Isn't this a very dangerous thing? Therefore, I hope that all citizens will enthusiastically go to the nearest injection station to receive the injection. Last year, because the number of people injected was high and prevention was good, no epidemic cholera was discovered. This year may be a cholera year, and I hope that the number of people injected this year will be even higher, so that cholera will still not occur.</p>
<p>Second, recently, cases of diphtheria have been discovered this year. This disease is most easily transmitted to school-age children, especially because school-age children live a collective life, which makes it even easier to transmit. Therefore, this Bureau has started injecting diphtheria toxoid into school children to prevent it from spreading. I hope that citizens with children will pay attention to this.</p>
<p>Third, recently, it has been discovered that illegal merchants in the market are greedy for profit and are selling dead pigs, evading the inspection work of the Bureau's meat inspectors, and passing them off as edible meat. I attach great importance to this, because the entire body of a dead pig is full of bacteria. If it is used as edible meat, aren't people simply eating the bacteria on the pig's body? When you think about it, aren't you afraid? Therefore, the immoral behavior of these illegal merchants can also be said to be exterminating humanity. I have strictly urged all meat inspectors and environmental health inspectors to work harder in the future and to patrol the main roads at any time and crack down severely. We must absolutely eliminate the mixing of dead pigs with edible meat in the future. At the same time, I hope that citizens will pay attention to themselves. Any pork that does not have the Bureau's meat inspection seal or has been inspected and deemed unsuitable for human consumption with a rejection stamp must not be purchased or eaten. Do not try to save money for a moment and test the bacteria on the pig's body, giving the bacteria a chance to lurk inside the human body. On the other hand, I also hope that citizens will assist the government to take strict control and, if there is any sale of meat that is not suitable for consumption being passed off as edible meat, report it to the Bureau immediately for strict crackdown.</p>
<p>Fourth, the weather will gradually get hotter, and the number of cold drink stalls by the roadside will gradually increase. Most of these cold drink stalls are unhygienic. Even if there are no flies hiding, the ingredients in these cold drinks may not be clean, or there may be raw, cold water in them. Some fruits, sugar cane, water chestnuts, lotus roots, and water caltrops are sprinkled with unclean cold water, which is also unhygienic. Originally, this Bureau has been cracking down on food at any time and anywhere. Now that the summer season is approaching, cholera is most likely to occur, and these cold drinks should be cracked down on even more strictly. I hope that citizens will not easily try unhygienic cold drinks.</p>
<p>Fifth, regarding the accumulation of garbage that often occurs on various roads in the past, which is not only unhygienic, but also unsightly, I pay special attention to it. Garbage is generated by every household every day. If it is not removed, it will of course accumulate more and more. This is something that anyone can see. Since I am the Director of the Bureau of Health, my duty is concerned, and I will of course never be indifferent and allow it to accumulate, merely causing disgust to the citizens, and I must try to remove it at all times. However, sometimes there are inevitable practical difficulties that stand in the way, so that it cannot be removed according to the original plan for a while. For example, the wages of workers were originally very low. Although they have now been increased, the original vehicles used to transport garbage have become old and damaged day by day, so that the number of vehicles that can be used is decreasing day by day. Then, the garbage that cannot be removed and accumulates will proportionally increase day by day. This is a serious issue that cannot be ignored. Now, the materials needed to repair the vehicles have been purchased, and I have already submitted a request to the superiors to send someone to inspect and accept them immediately, so that they can be used for repair. At that time, the number of garbage trucks will increase day by day. If the citizens can no longer discard or dump garbage everywhere in the city, then there will be no more accumulation. Now that the weather is about to get hot, I hope that citizens will not dump garbage everywhere, so as not to breed flies and spread germs. At the same time, I hope that the Baojia personnel will closely assist and cooperate to prevent citizens from dumping garbage everywhere. Because garbage is generated by every household every day, and paying attention to hygiene is also something that every household should pay attention to. If one household does not pay attention to hygiene and gets an epidemic disease, it will immediately spread to others. Therefore, it is best for the Baojia personnel to assist this Bureau in preventing citizens from dumping garbage everywhere. I hope that the Baojia personnel and the citizens will cooperate closely.</p>
<p>Sixth, the cost of living is increasing day by day, and the cost of childbirth for poor pregnant women has also become a serious problem. Therefore, this Bureau is planning to establish a public maternity hospital in the urban area, which can be established after it is approved by the municipal government. However, before it is established, this Bureau has already made a special agreement with the Guangci Hospital in this city to temporarily attach dozens of free maternity beds in this hospital. Any poor pregnant woman in this city who truly does not have the ability to pay the expenses can apply to this Bureau. After being approved by this Bureau, they will be sent to this hospital for hospitalization and childbirth, and she will be provided with free services. In addition, we have also contacted various public and private maternity hospitals to accept free or reduced-fee poor pregnant women. I hope that listeners will pass this message on to poor pregnant women if they encounter them.</p>
<p>Seventh, our country has always had a saying, "The people are the foundation of the nation," but the mortality rate of our Chinese compatriots is very high, which is a very worrying matter. Examining its causes, it is nothing more than the fact that the level of hygiene education among the people is too low. Therefore, the promotion of hygiene education is not to be delayed. This Bureau has contacted Shanghai Radio and French Radio to regularly send personnel from this Bureau to broadcast common sense about hygiene, and also wants to contact the Baojia authorities to periodically convene Baojia chiefs to hold hygiene education symposiums, and plans to hold hygiene sports meetings regularly. Once the municipal government approves the funding, it can be held. Last year, many people visited the hygiene sports meeting. If it is actually possible to hold it this year, please visit it, listeners. It is very meaningful.</p>
<p>Eighth, I also hold the position of Director of the Rescue Department of the Civilian Air Defense Headquarters of the city. The personnel of the Rescue Department are staff members seconded from the Bureau of Health. Because I saw that the number of air raids in Mushi is gradually increasing, I have already prepared measures for rescue work when the city is attacked. The general idea is: according to the police precinct area, except for the naval Baojia area, rescue teams will be established in the south of the Suzhou River and in Pudong, with a total of thirteen units, so as to immediately implement rescue during air raids. Each unit is also each area, with one rescue team leader, who is the president of a local famous hospital, responsible for directing various rescue matters in his area, and all hospitals and doctors in each area will be organized into major injury hospitals, minor injury hospitals, and rescue stations. Whenever people suffer major injuries that require major surgery, they will be sent to major injury hospitals for treatment. Whenever people suffer minor injuries that require minor surgery, they will be sent to minor injury hospitals for treatment. Whenever injured people only need to have medicine applied and bandages, it will be handled by the rescue station. As for the rescue classes run by the Air Defense Training Institute of the Air Defense Headquarters, the Bureau also sends people to serve as instructors. The Bureau also selects personnel from the Bureau's civil servants at all levels to organize special rescue teams to carry out strict air defense rescue training and general military knowledge, so as to be sent to various rescue areas in the future to guide rescue work, and is currently rushing to train. Therefore, there are considerable measures in place for rescue matters when the city is attacked in the future. However, I still hope that citizens will try to avoid danger quickly during air raids. This is very important.</p>
<p>Other issues such as the Bureau's promotion of medicine management, rectification of municipal hospitals and clinics, expansion of school hygiene, popularization of hygiene education, promotion of women's hygiene, implementation of labor hygiene and prison hygiene, etc., have already been published. I will talk about the rest when I have the opportunity in the future.</p>
<h3>Banning Sensational News</h3>
<p>— Yao Jiong</p>
<p>The case of Zhan Zhou's murder of her husband, which occurred not long ago, immediately spread throughout Shanghai after being published in various newspapers, becoming the subject of idle chatter for people of all kinds after tea and dinner. Some unscrupulous people even fabricated rumors from it, attracting crowds of people in the streets and alleys, hoping to see the scene of the murderer parading the streets. From this, it can be inferred that the impact of newspapers' revealing news on the majority of people in society is huge. If, at this time, it were to be used as a tool to disturb local public order by organized unscrupulous elements, it would be unimaginable. In my opinion, newspapers should not publish such cases, and I hope that the news censorship authorities will ban them.</p>
<p>This type of case is indeed cruel and inhumane and should be severely punished. However, if it is published rashly at the time of its initial occurrence, it will only be used by a part of the population to make profits, and some newspapers will photograph and print it, and even some small theaters will stage dramas, which not only wastes materials and time, but also, most seriously, gives uninformed people a bad suggestion—that even if you commit murder, you can still be in the limelight, and its impact is very bad.</p>
<p>I believe that if this type of news can be published based on the facts after the investigation is completed and the judicial authorities have pronounced the sentence, it will not only avoid such a bad impulse on society, but also allow those who do evil to know what to be wary of. Its effect will definitely be greater than publishing it before the sentence is pronounced.</p>
<h3>General Overview of Municipal and County Affairs</h3>
<p>— Tan Shuzhan</p>
<p>1.  Organization of the County Administration Office</p>
<p>Before the Incident (referring to war), the administrative area of this city only included the urban area (including what is now the suburban area). After the Incident, seven counties surrounding the urban area, namely Baoshan, Jiading, Chongming, Shenjiang (formerly under Shanghai County), Chuansha, Nanhui, and Fengxian, were transferred from Jiangsu Province to the jurisdiction of this city. Therefore, the Municipal Government of this city is responsible for both municipal affairs and county affairs. However, despite these dual responsibilities, the Municipal Government has not established a dedicated agency for the county affairs department. This often leads to neglecting one aspect for another. Furthermore, each bureau and office independently corresponds with the counties, resulting in two or three bureaus handling the same matter. This not only makes the procedures cumbersome and time-consuming but also leads to inconsistencies in management and a lack of centralized authority, significantly affecting administrative efficiency. Therefore, the Municipal Government established the County Administration Office on March 1st of this year, specifically to centrally manage the county affairs of this city.</p>
<p>The organization of the County Administration Office, in addition to the Director and Deputy Director, includes two secretaries, one or two assistant secretaries, and four sections. The First Section is in charge of documents, personnel, and general affairs; the Second Section is in charge of civil affairs, economy, and police administration; the Third Section is in charge of finance, construction, and land administration; and the Fourth Section is in charge of culture, education, social welfare, and propaganda. In addition, there are also commissioners, inspectors, and technical personnel.</p>
<p>After the establishment of the County Administration Office, its policies, in addition to guiding various counties to promote various administrative tasks, also include drafting an outline for strengthening the implementation of county administration, which has been submitted to the Municipal Government for approval. In addition, it has also taken over the police administration of various counties and convened a police administration discussion meeting with the heads of the police bureaus of various counties on the 20th of this month. In short, the policy focuses on increasing the administrative efficiency of various counties, improving the police administration of various counties, supervising the collection of land taxes in kind in various counties, promoting increased production, advancing education, improving the treatment of county government staff, and rectifying official discipline.</p>
<p>2.  "Outline for Strengthening the Implementation of County Administration"</p>
<p>The "Outline for Strengthening the Implementation of County Administration" drafted by the County Administration Office has been submitted to the Municipal Government for approval and implementation. The content is divided into eight parts: First, strengthening the organization, focusing on streamlining unnecessary subsidiary institutions and strengthening the responsibilities of district chiefs and township leaders; Second, strengthening personnel, focusing on training, performance evaluation, rewards, and punishments, as well as loyalty to duty; Third, strengthening official correspondence, focusing on speed and effectiveness; Fourth, strengthening civil affairs, focusing on cooperation between officials and the people, effectively promoting administration, rectifying official discipline, promoting private enterprises, and alleviating people's suffering (such as eliminating opium and gambling), and rectifying concurrent judicial administration; Fifth, strengthening finance, focusing on establishing the foundation of county finance, implementing the collection of land taxes in kind, consolidating local public funds and properties, and stabilizing rural finance; Sixth, strengthening construction, focusing on building roads and bridges, implementing increased production and reclamation, as well as promoting afforestation and promoting handicrafts, and laying the foundation for rural economic development; Seventh, strengthening education, focusing on strengthening school education, increasing the number of rural primary schools, promoting universal education, training teachers, and improving student achievement; Eighth, strengthening public security, focusing on rectifying county security teams and police discipline, eliminating local hidden bandits, ensuring local security, strengthening the baojia (household registration) and self-defense corps system, and protecting the safety of law-abiding citizens.</p>
<p>3.  Public Security Situation in Various Counties</p>
<p>The public security in various counties of this city was previously poor, and clearing campaigns were implemented one after another. Now that the clearing work has long been completed, the public security situation is still good. However, there are still some bandits hiding in remote rural areas, but under the current police system, it does not hinder the overall public security.</p>
<p>4.  Financial Situation in Various Counties</p>
<p>Regarding the financial situation of various counties in this city, according to the Municipal Government's regulations for the land tax revenue in the 33rd year of the Republic, 40% is to be handed over to the municipal treasury, and 60% is to be retained by the county to fund local expenses. In addition to administrative expenses being issued by the Municipal Government, police and construction education undertakings are all paid from local funds. This is more than enough for large counties, but it is insufficient for small counties. Therefore, in the current year (34th year of the Republic), the Municipal Government has decided that after the land tax is changed to collection in kind, all the finances of the counties will be centrally collected and disbursed by the Municipal Government (that is, all county tax revenues will be handed over to the municipal treasury, and all county expenses will be estimated and issued by the municipal treasury). Therefore, the financial difficulties of various counties can be easily solved.</p>
<p>5.  Economic Production in Various Counties</p>
<p>The economic production in various counties of this city is mainly agricultural production. Generally speaking, the ratio is 70% cotton and 30% rice. Therefore, the rice production in various counties is mostly insufficient. In addition to relying on the supply of rice from Jiangsu Province, the local people's food also needs to be supplemented by flour and miscellaneous grains. Currently, various counties are stepping up the implementation of increased production, and vegetable production has also been listed as one of the departments for increased production. In addition to promoting it through incentive methods, the method of increasing production in agricultural land from time to time is also adopted.</p>
<p>In addition, the blockade checkpoints set up in various counties during the clearing campaign period are now being contacted and removed as the clearing work has been completed. Once the preparations are completed, they can be officially abolished.</p>
<p>6.  Treatment of Police in Various Counties</p>
<p>The treatment of police in various counties was extremely low in the past in several counties, such as Nanhui and Chuansha, where each police officer only received about 90 yuan per month. The County Administration Office considered raising it when Luo Qian was the concurrently Director, to be equal to the Security Team. That is, in addition to giving each police officer three dou of rice per month, there will also be a salary of more than 4,000 yuan. This has also been agreed upon at the recent police administration discussion meeting and is now being submitted to the Municipal Government for approval. Once approved, it will be implemented immediately.</p>
<p>7.  Administrative Relations Between Various Counties</p>
<p>of This City and Neighboring Counties in Jiangsu Province</p>
<p>Although the counties of this city are adjacent to Jiangsu Province, each county implements its own laws and regulations. Therefore, there is no direct administrative relationship with the neighboring counties in Jiangsu Province. However, in indirect administration, such as road construction related to transportation and joint defense and suppression related to public security, there are still occasional contacts between each other. (Editor's Note: The author is the Deputy Director of the Shanghai Special Municipal County Administration Office)</p>
<h3>Model Baojia Construction Movement</h3>
<p>— Luo Ding</p>
<p>The Baojia Office of the Naval Garrison District, in order to promote the standardization and sound development of civil autonomous organizations, has specifically planned to promote the "Model Baojia Construction Experiment Movement." The goal is to universally extend the effective results gained from local experiments to the entire district so that it becomes a sound fundamental organization for building a new China and implementing constitutional government.</p>
<p>The district currently includes nine subdistricts. Most of these subdistricts have seventy to eighty bao (groups of households), while some have less than ten. In total, the Naval Baojia District has a population of over 700,000. It is currently planned to designate three bao in each district as model bao. Investigations are currently underway, and implementation is expected to begin in early May. The time frame is limited to three months.</p>
<p>In terms of organization, a "Model Baojia Construction Experiment Movement Headquarters" will be established as the highest guidance institution. It will adopt a committee system, with the Director, Chief Secretary, District Chiefs, Section Chiefs, District Guidance Officers, and Secretaries as members of the committee. The Director will serve as the Chairman of the Committee, and the Chief Secretary will serve as the Vice Chairman. In order to strengthen the implementation of the movement, a Supervision Department will be established within the headquarters, with the Chief Secretary as the person in charge, and staff members will be assigned to handle the following matters: Conducting household registration surveys; Presiding over meetings of the Head of Ten Households and Bao Chiefs; Collecting Baojia fees; Engaging in air defense and self-defense; Promoting propaganda and enlightenment, and mutual assistance. A Model Baojia Construction Experiment Movement District Office will be established as the executing agency in each district. The District Committee will consist of the District Chief as the Chairman, the Head of General Affairs as the Vice Chairman, and district staff members as committee members. The District Chief Guidance Officer will, based on the instructions of the Supervision Department of the Headquarters, direct district staff members to handle the various matters under the jurisdiction of the Supervision Department.</p>
<p>The work in the experimental districts is as follows: Conscientiously convene meetings of the Head of Ten Households and Bao Chiefs, and fully listen to and adopt public opinions; Conduct detailed household registration surveys and conscientiously collect Baojia fees; Launch mutual assistance activities such as consumer cooperatives, communal kitchens, baojia farms, and nurseries; Emphasize practical work and effectiveness to idealize air defense and self-defense activities; Expand the practical work of propaganda, enlightenment, and public education movements; Implement the election of Head of Ten Households and Bao Chiefs.</p>
<p>The sequence of work development is as follows: First, designate the experimental bao in each district, investigate the current situation of the experimental bao, assign responsible experiment workers, establish work plans, procedures, and methods, and pay attention to practical promotion after the work begins in order to achieve practical results.</p>
<p>The existing organization of the Naval Baojia District is very complete, and the cooperation between residents and the authorities is quite earnest. They bear more obligations and have more guarantees. The Baojia fees have been re-regulated since April: 100 yuan per month for a tenant of a three-room house, 200 yuan per month for a landlord of a two-room house, 400 yuan for a store with one storefront, 600 yuan for two storefronts, 800 yuan for three storefronts, 1,000 yuan for four storefronts, and factories are also graded according to their scale. The residents are also working hard on air defense. The excavation of air-raid shelters has been successfully completed. The members of the self-defense corps have devoted themselves to rescue work, which has played a exemplary and leading role. In the future, they can set up learning role models. At the same time, conveying lower-level information to higher-level and higher-level intentions to lower-level will also be the focus of future work. Other mutual assistance work and strengthening public education are also necessary preliminary work for the future implementation of constitutional government, and must be resolutely promoted.</p>
<p>Geographical Situation</p>
<p>As for the geographical situation of Okinawa Island, it is briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>Okinawa Island is located in the center of the Ryukyu Islands. It is the largest island in the archipelago and the main part of Okinawa Prefecture. It is about 135 kilometers long and 35 kilometers wide at its widest point and 5 kilometers at its narrowest. The island is narrow and long, with a perimeter of about 400 kilometers and an area of 1,211 square kilometers (including small affiliated islands). The northern part of the island (the rounded head) is mainly composed of ancient formations, forming a mountainous area. The spinal mountain range runs from northeast to southwest, and subtropical plants such as gel tree are luxuriant. Due to the lack of flat land on the island, the gathering places of the population are limited to narrow coasts and bay heads, and the main roads are built along the East Asian coast.</p>
<p>The southern part of the island (Naha City, Shuri City, and most of Nakagami District and Shimajiri District) is a swamp with an altitude of less than 200 meters. The geology belongs to the Tertiary strata, with coral limestone on top. The rivers are short and small, and the water volume increases sharply during rainfall, but is very low at other times. Most of the island's population is concentrated here, and railways are also limited to this area. The old capital Shuri City and Naha City are located in the center of this area. The latter is the center of the prefectural government and the only port city, with a prosperous city. Itoman Town in the south is particularly prosperous in fishing.</p>
<p>Maejima Island is one of the Kerama Islands in Shimajiri District, Okinawa Prefecture, and is narrow and long from northeast to southwest. The perimeter is about eight kilometers. There are islands such as Hader (transliteration) Island and Naka Island to the northeast. The whole island is overgrown with shrubs. The residents live on the east coast, almost all engaged in fishing.</p>
<p>Kamiyama Island is located about eleven kilometers north of Naha Port and is the easternmost and smallest island of the Kei Islands (also known as the Kei San Islands). The entire island is made of calcareous gravel and is flat, with lush Atan trees. The low-lying areas are submerged by seawater at high tide, dividing it into two islands.

<h3>Distant Memorial</h3>
<p>— Yi Xuan</p>
<p>I haven't thought about home for many years! I don't dare to think about it, and I'm even more afraid of thinking about it. If I think about home, I can't help but think about the bittersweet family of my childhood; I can't help but mourn my father, who loved me the most and died of illness in his prime; I can't help but miss my aging mother leaning on the door, yearning for me; I can't help but remotely worry about you struggling in our poor hometown; I can't help but think about the desolate fields and the displaced uncles and brothers struggling to make a living in all directions. Thinking about home fills me with endless sorrow! I don't dare to think about it, I'm afraid of thinking about it, I haven't thought about home for a long time.</p>
<p>However, this kind of suppressed and latently present emotion, once suddenly bursts out, its sadness and pain often surpass normal emotions.</p>
<p>For the past year, I knew you were sick. I was afraid to receive letters from home, but I also looked forward to receiving letters from home. Every time, every time I repeatedly looked at the letters from home, every time, every time I couldn't help but shed tears, because I thought about home again, because I missed you even more.</p>
<p>The year before last, I vomited a basin full of fresh blood. The year before that, after suffering from dysentery and typhus, I also contracted pneumonia. I had no choice but to leave my friends and drag my sick body to the snowy north to recuperate. At that time, I was afraid that if I died far from home, I would leave my mother with the "pain of losing her sight" and leave you with the "sorrow of broken wings"; who knew that just as my health was gradually improving, I heard the news that you had been bedridden for years; who knew that it was you who left my mother with the "pain of losing her sight," and it was you who left me with the "sorrow of broken wings." Truly, who knew that after I returned south, I would spend day and night grieving for you with my remaining illness!</p>
<p>Brother Kuan, I cried loudly when I received the letter from home in the north, knowing that you had throat TB. I was afraid that you could not stay in this world for long, and I was afraid that this life would be a long farewell for us, but I did not expect that on the second day of my return to Shanghai, I learned from Uncle Liu that you had already passed away for half a year. At that time, my family was still hiding it from me. I cried, but to what avail?</p>
<p>It was not until a month ago that my younger brother wrote to tell me the news of your death, and also described his own symptoms as the same as yours. At that time, I was wandering around, holding the book, wiping away tears, unable to finish reading. Although the book was burned by my Uncle Liu on the spot, however, Uncle Liu's actions could not reduce the sorrow in my heart. I cried, I was afraid that my younger brother would die of illness! I cried, but to what avail!</p>
<p>For the past eight or nine years, we have been communicating, we have been encouraging each other, we have been comforting each other, we have stored up thousands of feelings of separation, we have been looking forward to the day when the wandering siblings can reunite in our homeland; but now I still have thousands of words, but how can I confide them to you!</p>
<p>For the past eight or nine years, we have all grown up. I miss you, I can't imagine how tall you have grown. In my dreams, I see you as children in your teens, bouncing around. It seems that I have forgotten that you have died. We are still talking and laughing as before. Soon, the rooster crows and the dream breaks. When dawn is approaching, you are gone. You will never be in this world again!</p>
<p>Brother Kuan, Brother Jun, in childhood, following our parents, our footsteps have almost traversed this ancient country; in childhood, we have cooperated in many mischievous stories; now, even if I run all over the world, who can join me in tracing the past? I can only see the shadow of your lost childhood in the childishness of any innocent and mischievous child. Every time I see a friend's younger brother, every time I think of you, and even every day I face the children in the streets and alleys, I will be reminded of you.</p>
<p>Grandmother died of lung disease, father died of lung disease, tenth uncle died of lung disease, and you also died of lung disease one after another. In this ancient country, 90% of people have latent tuberculosis germs in their bodies, and those who die of tuberculosis are everywhere. Many people struggling on the iron cold front lines are walking the path of lung disease due to malnutrition and overwork. Many people do not know that they have lung disease and let it spread, and many people do not have the strength to treat it and are approaching the edge of death. In this ancient country, it is the working country where tuberculosis germs spread!</p>
<p>When I imagine all those who suffer from lung disease as you, my heart can't bear my sorrow!</p>
<p>How will I use my full of sorrow to remotely mourn you who died of illness in the distance?</p>
<h3>After Separation</h3>
<p>— Steve</p>
<p>Wanting to completely forget everything, I wave my hand tremblingly at the bottom of the seven-stringed zither; the three months after separation have left no trace, like a blank page of paper. The deserted island is no longer a human realm. There is no longer a paradise in this world; wanting to completely forget everything is impossible. The quiet words of the forests and springs often sell me to the past. Falsely alarmed by the ten-mile pine waves, I no longer blame myself for being so meticulous. Since there is no piece of paradise now, I will destroy the love I have built. The three paths are overgrown with weeds! The flowers and plants I cultivated have not waited for this year's spring breeze, but still have to wait another winter. Even if time cannot be turned back, I have no regrets, only that all warmth is palpable. I will embrace the thunder of next spring. Please return to the scene of the whipping knight. I am here, and I am conveying to you, this future is precious!</p>
<h3>Lamenting the Passing</h3>
<p>— Fang Zheng</p>
<p>The chirping of insects in the corner replaces the cicada's noise at the treetop; yesterday it seemed to be "the scorching sun blazing like fire," but blink of an eye it is the season of "fishing alone in the cold river snow"; and waiting just a moment longer, it will be the spring of "ten miles of orioles singing, green reflecting red." The giant wheel of time is always spinning non-stop!</p>
<p>Time makes people old, which is the most irrecoverable regret in the world. Although not prone to melancholy, I cannot help but feel sad and distraught every time the seasons change. Hoping for "eternal spring" and "eternal youth" is a constant human emotion, but we can only read about Dr. Hawthorne's ideal elixir of life, "The Elixir of Youth," in books, but cannot drink a drop of the elixir of immortality. As the protagonist, Dr. Heidegger, said well: "My old friends! I have always been experimenting in this laboratory to amuse myself. Now I would like to ask you to help me with a small experiment." This is tantamount to telling us that the matter of returning to youth is just an "experiment." If we really go to fantasize about drinking "The Elixir of Youth," the result will be as disappointing and sad as the four old men who were experimented on. Otherwise, Cao Mengde, the "hero of the world," and Napoleon, the "eccentric genius of the world," would not have aroused people's sigh of "Where are they now?" Lu You's poem: "A hundred plans cannot escape gray hair." Du Gongbu's poem: "It is rare for a man to live to seventy in ancient times." Liu Changqing's poem: "Looking at my shadow, what can I do with my white hair?" This kind of passive chanting is nothing more than an expression of the ancients' lament for the fleeting passage of time. Originally, in such a short life, who does not have the feeling of "life is like a dream, what is the purpose of power?" As long as you see whether you can grasp the passing time, it is good to "not let your youth down."</p>
<p>Due to the change of seasons, I often ask myself the related question: "What is life after all?" When I read Xu Zhimo's "Keats' Grave," I seemed to get a partial solution. He said: "What is life after all? You have to add your annotations, you have to express your 'view.'" Tao Yuanming said: "Everyone is floating in this river, and one day they will be submerged in it. Let me take advantage of the good scenery of Nanshan today, plant a chrysanthemum and drink a cup of sweet wine." Li Taibai, Su Dongpo, and Lu Fangweng all echoed that was right. Their "view" is in the wine glass. The ancient poem Nineteen Poems often expresses: life passes in a flash, but you have to live it. Thinking of immortality is foolish, grasping the present and enjoying happiness as much as possible is true.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, people are all unaccompanied lone travelers in the world. Each individual is a lonely soul when they become aware. Zhuangzi also had no way to deal with this long time. He borrowed a dry skull to imagine another universe, where the process of birth is no longer subject to the limitations of time. The ancient Roman poet Horace also said: "Life is a comedy from the point of view of those who observe it, but it is a tragedy from the point of view of those who feel it."</p>
<p>One day on the road, I met a friend, Mr. C, whom I had not seen for two years. Judging from his old clothes and broken shoes, he must have been working hard. He was still the same as before. After we happily exchanged greetings, he told me that he had something very proud of recently. It turned out that his wife had died. He did not grieve for his wife's death, but said he was proud. I suspected that he might have been too sad and developed a mental illness. While I was suspicious, my friend explained in great detail, saying that in this era of living in suffering, not seeing with a glance, isn't that also happiness? This eccentric remark, a complaint, was certainly extremely absurd upon first hearing, but after careful consideration, it was a sentiment from the heart; he can be said to be a faithful believer of Tao Jingjie.</p>
<p>This article, hastily written to this point, should also come to an end. Recalling the Qianjia Poetry, Cui Tu's "Travel Feelings" poem, the opening sentence is "The flowing water and falling flowers are both merciless." Isn't that so? Flowing water and falling flowers are merciless. Don't let your youth pass in vain! Don't you think so?</p>
<h3>Pawn</h3>
<p>— Bai Fan</p>
<p>Willing to treat forbearance as a layer of sugar coating,</p>
<p>To wrap up the excess emotions.</p>
<p>Thick affection is originally despicable;</p>
<p>Love—that meddlesome wasp,</p>
<p>Let it sting fierce horses as it stings a Su Lan's heart?</p>
<p>The universe has boundless vastness,</p>
<p>Heartache is a drop of dew;</p>
<p>If I have been destined to be a pawn,</p>
<p>I shouldn't even frown if my arm or leg is broken;</p>
<p>The warmth lost in my full grasp,</p>
<p>Why look back again?</p>
<p>When silently carrying the memory like a grain of dust,</p>
<p>Embark on the road of ten thousand miles without regret;</p>
<p>Let Mount Tai collapse in front of me,</p>
<p>Ah, I have no right to tremble!</p>
<h3>The Unfolding of Emotion</h3>
<p>— Xiao Yi</p>
<p>Lately, I often like to lean alone at the back doorway, gazing at the horizon, turning some inexplicable thoughts. I don't know why, I just feel more comfortable like this.</p>
<p>There are many suffering people in the world, who often restrain their emotions and become coy. For the sake of a kind of "worldly" mask, they cannot willfully do what they like to do. Their reason and emotion restrict and bind each other, falling into the abyss of pain. They cannot laugh frankly at happy things, and they cannot cry frankly when facing sad things. This is the sorrow of distress. When I have been wronged and in pain, I really want to hide alone in a room and cry heartily, letting the depression flow away with the tears. I would rather have swollen eyes tomorrow and let people laugh at me, than be a painful, guilty, reluctant hero. Knowing how to find an appropriate occasion to let emotions unfold innocently will surely lead to a happy life. Just like my gazing at the blue sky and thinking freely, although it does not contain any purpose, allowing emotions and inspiration to gallop freely will bring pleasure. Sometimes, you can even get great enlightenment. The success of many things often starts in leisure. I also often feel that a life that is too busy and bound by the rules of work is a painful burden. There should be some leisure, or some leisure should be extracted from being busy to live leisurely, to protect and nurture one's emotions, to make one's humanity more true, good, and beautiful. This is not extravagant enjoyment and waste of time. I remember when Gorky was old, he smiled at a group of innocent children in the park. He kindly stroked them, the advanced love for mankind from the bottom of his heart. Just imagine how sublime and comfortable it is to be intoxicated by such overflowing love!</p>
<p>To get the enjoyment of emotional unfolding, what must be paid attention to is the demand for absolute innocence. Any affectation or forced imitation is completely a tool of bondage, that is to say, "truth" is needed in the realm of "beauty." Finally, listening to music is also a good tool to help emotional unfolding and human nature cultivation.</p>
<h3>Snippets</h3>
<p>— Hu Shengquan</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Outside the window is wind, is rain, is snow; inside the room, accompanying me, are only my own shadow and a flickering candlelight. I quietly count the beating of my heart, seemingly forgetting all emotions. Laughter is not necessarily for joy, and tears are not necessarily for the sake of pain.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a child's crying came from the next room. Why such a sharp scream? I stood up and asked someone to bring him over, but who knew he opened his eyes wide, faced the candlelight, and smiled.</p>
<p>--Ah, how fickle are the things that cry and laugh! I couldn't help but smile too.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Lately, it seems I live very leisurely, and also that I live very tensely; this has aroused envy, regret, and blame from many of my friends. But as for myself, I haven't planned anything, just living day by day like a monk ringing the bell. In this day and age, how many things can one decide for oneself? I just want to be busy when I'm free, and secretly laze when I'm busy.</p>
<p>There are many days when life is truly too boring. I don't want to read, don't want to write, don't want to... don't want anything! So I throw myself into the crowds on the street, following people running around in a panic. Occasionally, my heel bumps into someone else's, and I blush and get flustered, making things very "tense."</p>
<p>"Are you rushing to put out a fire?"</p>
<p>"Are you rushing to put out a fire!"</p>
<p>"Are you rushing to report a death?"</p>
<p>"Are you rushing to report a death!"</p>
<p>If there weren't such noisy commotion every day, wouldn't life in this world seem even more lifeless?</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>For a long, long time, I've learned to sigh. "Why do you sigh so deeply?" When someone asks me, I can only vaguely shake my head. I can't answer the reason. I just feel that I have to "sigh," and I involuntarily "sigh" it out.</p>
<p>Many kind-hearted friends are concerned about my health, saying that constantly sighing like this is very bad for my body. My mother is also worried about this, saying that constant sighing is also related to the rise and fall of the family's fortune. So I often subconsciously suppress the "sigh" that's in my throat and swallow it into my stomach.</p>
<p>However, I become thinner day by day. Facing the mirror, I shed tears - this world is suitable for sighing, but I can't sigh. How insignificant am I!</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>With the wind and snow, spring has finally arrived. Last year, on a moonlit night like this, I got drunk. A friend sitting next to me suddenly had a burst of artistic inspiration and wanted to write poetry. I am a vulgar person and an amateur when it comes to music, chess, calligraphy, painting, and poetry. But after his repeated prodding, and relying on some drunken strength, I actually completed a vaguely wonderful ancient-style poem of seven characters per line. Among them were four lines: "Sorrowful thoughts are as lush as the dense green, what good do down-and-out friends bring? When awake, I dance with my sword; when drunk, I sleep, I am a sleeping dragon in Nanyang." Who knew that it would make him angry, saying that I was "not self-deprecating and presumptuously comparing myself to the sages of the past." From his letter full of "zhī hū zhě yě" (classical Chinese particles), I had truly become a heinous person. This made me laugh. Of course, I was too frivolous, but if an elegant person has only such a measure of tolerance, how can he be considered someone of standing?</p>
<p>Now, spring has come again. I am still the same as before, except that I sigh more, and I dare not arbitrarily express my complaints.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>I don't hide my pride. I'm too lazy to turn my eyes to those shallow vulgar people. However, on sleepless nights, I suddenly re-evaluated myself. "What am I?" I jumped out of bed. I have more shortcomings than others. I am the most unworthy one.</p>
<p>--Go away, you useless thing!</p>
<p>I scolded myself. But what's the use? Another "me" is laughing coldly: "You scold me, but I am you!"</p>
<p>Recently, I can't even stand myself. I feel that I have no reason to forgive myself, but I can blame others.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>My sudden silence, like a philosopher, surprised many friends who were used to my meddlesome nature. "So-and-so has changed, becoming a bit outdated and depressed." I heard them sighing secretly like this, and my heart felt a hidden pain.</p>
<p>Am I not still very young? Is the blood flowing in my veins not the same fresh, red blood as everyone else's? But why is my soul so old? I have questioned myself several times, shouting out such a voice in my heart</p>
<p>--Forgive me, I can't answer you!</p>
<p>I remember that a doctor once prescribed such a prescription for a patient who was terminally ill: Fresh air and sunlight. Perhaps I also need a prescription that is equally suitable for my condition. Now, I am waiting, waiting for that prescription that will restore my youthful vitality!</p>
<p>Map of the Southern Part of Okinawa Island</p>
<p>Since the enemy Americans began landing on the southern part of Okinawa Island on March 25, more than a month has passed in an instant. After the Japanese army bravely fought back, the enemy army has remained confined to the landing points, such as Kadena, Chatan, Awase, Naha, Shuri, Itoman, and Hanakawa, unable to advance. According to the announcement of the Japanese General Headquarters, from the 19th of this month when the enemy army began its general offensive until the 23rd, the enemy army's losses were determined to be as follows: More than 6,000 personnel killed or wounded, 80 armored vehicles destroyed, 11 artillery pieces, and countless military supplies captured. The Japanese army's achievements in this battle will further strengthen its belief in the victory of future operations in Okinawa.</p>

<h3>Volleyball Season is About to Begin, All the Mighty Armies are Actively Preparing</h3>
<p>Prelude: Three Provinces Friendship Match Against the White Team</p>
<p>The basketball season has passed, and exciting games have disappeared from the scene after three charity matches. The football league is also coming to an end, and although there are still a few exciting games left, it ultimately feels untimely. The volleyball season, which suits the season, is poised to rise in popularity. It is reported that the Volleyball Committee is scheduled to hold a meeting at 4:00 PM today to discuss the implementation plan. However, since both the Western Youth and Central Youth gymnasiums cannot be used simultaneously, the authorities must turn to outdoor venues for development. It is learned that all the mighty armies are actively preparing, aiming to have a good performance when the time comes.</p>
<p>Looking back at the last tournament, the champions were Guangdong Chinese School in Group A, Yongsan in Group B, and the Green Team in the women's division. The above three teams all had the best results. It is now heard that the Yongsan team is determined to continue its efforts and participate in Group A for further development. As for Guangdong Chinese School, it is awaiting the decision of the host Zhuo Xigeng. There is talk that the Green Team in the women's division may retire. This is because several members of the team have gotten married and will no longer show their skills. They also have the intention of making way for newcomers. After the league champion is produced, they will have an exhibition match with them. The teams currently practicing are introduced below:</p>
<p>Central Northern Team</p>
<p>Since Wang Zhongtao took charge of the Central Northern Team, it has been full of vigor. However, it only had a basketball team organization. In this year's open basketball tournament, the team won both the Group A and Group B championships. Because of this, Wang's interest in ball sports has become even stronger, and he has the intention of organizing a volleyball team. Among the basketball team members, there are volleyball skills, including Li Zhenzhong, Li Baozhong, Chen Xuechong, and Zhuo Guorong. Moreover, Baozhong and Xuechong's left-right attack and defense can be said to be the two best at sea. Checking their team members, it is ultimately felt that their strength is insufficient. It is then heard that Guangdong Chinese School will not continue to host, so the players may belong to the Central Northern Team. It is recently heard that negotiations are underway, and it is generally hoped that it will become a reality. If so, then the team will be very strong and can dominate this year's league.</p>
<p>Three Provinces Team</p>
<p>The news of the establishment of the Three Provinces Men's Volleyball Team was disclosed in the last issue of this publication. It is now learned that the team has been formally established and has a tight organization. The coach, Qi Gong, is a senior in the volleyball world, with excellent experience and knowledge. Most of its members are from the Yizhong Team, the runner-up in Group B last year. Checking Yizhong's performance last year, they repeatedly defeated strong teams in Group B. Until the final championship game, they lost to Yongsan by a very close score and were ranked second. But watching their performance, it was considered to be excellent. This time, with the guidance of a famous coach, they will definitely be able to go to the next level. It is heard that the team has decided to join Group A. Although they have no great ambitions, giving people satisfaction is naturally expected. The team's roster is copied below:</p>
<p>(Team Leader) Pan Sansheng, (Coach) Qi Gong, (Manager) Deng Xiaoliang, (Captain) Zhang Siwei, (Members) Cheng Yihong, Chen Xiaoping, Lin Shen, Xie Funeng, Huang Hongdao, Xiong Daxu, Zhang Borou, Tang Liangsun, Chen Jiayou, Chen Zedong, Yao Weny, and Yi.</p>
<p>White Team</p>
<p>The White Team has more than ten years of history in the volleyball world. Its record has always been maintained at a horizontal line. This is because the team has always focused on using sports for leisure and physical exercise, and initially had no ambitions. This is also why it cannot reach the peak. This year, at the beginning of the season, the team is active again and has started practicing. Captain Wang Deyuan said that he will still gather all the old members to participate in the league, to show the supreme spirit of the White Team in volleyball.</p>
<p>Winter Green Team</p>
<p>Checking the women's teams, since the Green Team has the saying that it may retire, Zhi Qian also has the situation of disintegration, and Western Youth Red is unlikely to form a team, then among the list of last year, there will only be the Three Provinces and Huayan teams, which will inevitably be deserted. But hopefully, emerging newcomers will actively participate, to make a success together, not to let down the good intentions of the authorities. Now news has come that the Winter Green Women's Volleyball Team has risen. Among them are well-known people such as Zhang Biru, Wang Jinfeng, and Liu Zuxin. Zhang Fengru was the pillar of the former Wuben Team and attended the Far East Games. The grandeur of her and Huang Xingfen in those years is still in our minds. However, in recent years, Miss Zhang has focused on education and has not played this tune for a long time. This time, she has made a comeback. It is not known what the result will be. Liu Zuxin is a famous general from Liangjiang and also a veteran of more than ten years ago. Miss Liu has always been a sports instructor, and her students are all over the place. Her interest in volleyball has never faded, so her skills are still as good as ever. There is also Wang Jinfeng, who has not been seen for a long time since she showed her talent in the Weiwei Women's Volleyball Team. The excellence of Miss Wang's three-pass set is what the author admires the most. It can be said that until now, no new general can compare with her. This time, she is showing her skills again, which will surely give fans the best impression. The team has these three veterans, plus Liu Zuxin's talented students, and the results should not be weak. However, the author has met with the above three, and it is learned that the team is purely for the purpose of strengthening the body and may not be preparing to participate in the league. The author, in view of the loneliness of this year's women's volleyball team, is doing his best to urge the team to participate. It is heard that the team is considering it.</p>
<p>Three Provinces to Play the White Team in the League Prelude Next Monday</p>
<p>In order to test their strength, the Three Provinces Team has specially invited the White Team to a friendly match next Monday (April 30) at the Provincial Office Stadium on Anfu Road. The strength of the two teams has been briefly introduced in the previous article. In the first game of the season, the two teams will naturally be welcomed. Moreover, the environment of the Provincial Office is beautiful, and the stadium is surrounded by trees. At this spring day, fans can watch the game and enjoy the pleasure of the park, which is a truly good deal. It is thought that the owner of the Provincial Residence will be able to openly welcome visitors, to show promotion. (Bei)</p>
<h3>As Football and Basketball End, the League Federation Competes with the Referees</h3>
<p>In the football league, with the abandonment of the game by the Donghua team tomorrow, the Group A competition will only have a duel between the League and the Portuguese. At the end of the last tournament, there was a friendly match between the Football Federation and the referee team, to show a great conclusion. Once a year, this year's friendly match has been decided to be held tomorrow afternoon at 3:00 PM in Jiaozhou Park. The competition focuses on fun, and ball skills are secondary. The official lineup of the two armies has been announced.</p>
<p>Football League</p>
<p>Zhou Jiaqi, Li Ning, Zhuang Youren, Takashi Takayama, Ma Shan'er, Jiang Yimen, Meng Nuo, Xuan Zhengdu, Shen Siliang, Shi Digen, Cheng Yize</p>
<p>Referee Team</p>
<p>He Chunhui, E Sen, Wu Shouheng, Jin Jiabiao, Wang Shoufang, Hu Chengquan, Lv Changfu, Zhang Le, Huang Fengjia, Li Guanxiong, Wang Wenyi</p>
<p>Football: Two Teams Compete in Jiaoyuan Tomorrow</p>
<p>Looking at the above list, both teams are all well-known people, but most are in their twilight years and may not have the ability to support the entire game, so both teams have a large number of reserves. The referee team has more than 20 people, which can be said to be a grand sight. Last time, the referee team won by a narrow margin of two to one. This time, the Football League is eager to take revenge and has the help of Li Ning, Zhuang Youren, and Ma Shan'er, so the back line can be said to be solid. All that is needed is to see the efforts of the front line to win the victory. The referee team has new people such as Huang Fengjia, and it is not known whether they can resist, otherwise, they will definitely lose. In short, this game has the meaning of a get-together, and fans are tending towards fun. The lively and grand occasion can definitely be predicted.</p>
<p>Basketball: The Group B Finals Will Include a Performance</p>
<p>The basketball league is currently only underway in various divisions of Group B, and it will also be completed soon. In the future, after the champions of each division are produced, a round-robin final will still be held. It is learned that at the final championship, the league authorities are also preparing to have a short performance of the Basketball League and the Referee Association.</p>
<p>The list of the old gentlemen's army of the Basketball League includes Zhu Zhongtao, Dai Changling, Zhou Jiaqi, Zhang Xiang, Qian Xucang, Niao Cheng, Shen Kunnan, Ling Xitao, and Lin Zuoshi. Among them, Wang Zhongtao, Zhang Xiang, and Qian Xucang have always been known on the court. The model of veteran style is still there, and their strength should not be underestimated. The referee team's list includes Wang Shoufang, Yu Ju, Jin Jiabiao, Chen Baolin, Yang Liecheng, Zheng Zhifang, Jin Botao, Zhou Huaibang, Wang Liwu, and Huang Cunrui. It seems that the old gentlemen's army of the League has potential. Zhou Huaibang is a representative of the Shanghai Bank basketball team's heyday. Jin Jiabiao is a good player in this area, and Jin Botao and Huang Cunrui have extraordinary skills. In terms of strength, they can be said to be comparable to the old men of the Basketball League, and in terms of energy, they are much more abundant. When they meet in the future, the victory will depend entirely on this. (Wang Duan)</p>
<h3>Basketball Referee Zhang Guoxun</h3>
<p>The famous basketball referee Zhang Guoxun was once prominent in the basketball world more than ten years ago. He also had considerable attainments in football refereeing. Because of a slight conflict in a Zhendan vs. Lequn football match, he later specialized in basketball refereeing and left the basketball world after the war. He was impartial and fair in his judgments, so the audience and players all had a good impression of him. Mr. Zhang is now 49 years old and graduated from Shanghai University. He is excellent in English. In his spare time from business, he was also a sports editor for an English newspaper and later editor-in-chief of a local newspaper. In the past three years, he has rarely interacted with the sports world. It is recently learned that he is teaching at Toufan Middle School. (Zuo Zuo)</p>
<h3>The Eastern League vs. Donghua Game Tomorrow: Donghua Announces Forfeiture</h3>
<p>In the football league, there will be a Group A match tomorrow between Donghua and the League. According to the two teams, the two giants of the Chinese team, can have a certain appeal, and the two teams have very few opportunities to meet. Just like the Donghua War last time, the Jiaozhou Garden created an unprecedented grand occasion. Now that there is such a good relationship, fans will naturally be happy to appreciate it. However, looking at the current situation form, Donghua has suffered three defeats. For the championship, it is hopeless. However, the League and the German Chamber of Commerce drew, and then drew with the Shanghai Police. The two draws are listed at the top with the Portuguese's one defeat (lost to the Overseas Chinese League). Although the Portuguese and the League have met, the result was not satisfactory due to the order relationship. Now the authorities have approved a rematch, so the League still has hope. Although Wu Qu has been expelled, the team has many talents and is well-adjusted, so its strength may not be slightly reduced. In addition, it has been practicing very hard recently, so it will definitely be able to do a lot. Under such circumstances, the Donghua authorities, in view of the fact that all the championships in this session have become the world of foreigners, only the League team in our Chinese team has this line of hope in this league. In the position of Donghua, it is indeed possible to allow the League to make the final effort to win glory for our Chinese people. In fact, Donghua's victory over the League would not be of much benefit. If it fails, it would be superfluous. Although the purpose of the ball game is not here. But in terms of reason, it is not impossible to violate the purpose of the sport. Therefore, the saying of Donghua is not just a rumor, but has become a reality.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Zhuang Youren, the secretary of Donghua, sent an official letter to the authorities of the Football League, stating that Donghua had decided to abandon the game tomorrow, making the League a success, and then fighting the Portuguese for the final. I hope that the League will work harder and not live up to Donghua's kindness.</p>
<h3>White Horse Cup Postponed</h3>
<p>The White Horse Cup Football Tournament, sponsored by Cheng Bo'an, the general manager of China Tobacco Company, has been approved by the Football League, but it must be held after the league is over, so it will be postponed to mid-May.</p>
<h3>China Table Tennis Room Opens Yesterday: Exciting Singles and Doubles Performances, Enthusiastic Audience of More Than a Thousand</h3>
<p>The China Table Tennis Room held its opening ceremony on the third floor of the New World on Nanjing Road at 7:00 PM yesterday and invited the best table tennis players in Shanghai to participate in performance competitions. More than a thousand people from all walks of life came to watch, which was very popular for a time. Zhou Daoqian and Wang Yi, directors of the Shanghai Table Tennis Federation, attended the ceremony, and famous sports figures, stadium celebrities, and famous players also came to watch the battle. As the ceremony began, Chen Linsheng was first invited to unveil the opening and deliver a speech, and guests Qu Zhaokang, Chen Tianjue, and Chen Zhong delivered speeches. Then, the entire female staff of the room cut the ribbon, and the performance began immediately, with Ding Du and Chen Jimao serving as referees. At the sound of the silver horn, the all-around famous player Lu Hanjun played against Zhang Ying, a good player who had not shown his face for a long time. The two generals came out to play in the warm applause of more than a thousand spectators. Lu drew and Zhang cut, and the opponents met. Lu lifted up one move and finally won three to one. The second group, short blocker Li Zongpei, cleverly met Fu Qifang. Xiao Fu was originally a good hard drawer, but he has been working hard to practice cutting recently and has also been successful. Therefore, during the competition process, drawing and cutting were used together. Although Li resisted desperately, he was exhausted by his lack of strength and lost to three to one. In the third group, Huang Zhijun faced Fang Keping. The two fought fiercely, and Keping had been practicing for a long time, and his hitting seemed to be unable to do what he wanted, so he was defeated by a score of one to three. The fourth group was played by the main players of the Shanghai Young and Strong faction, Xue Xuchu and Wang Youxin. Xue won the Shanghai Individual Table Tennis Championship in the last Jingwu Cup. His fierce attacking style can be called unique in the table tennis world. Youxin is also known for his hard pumping and has recently defeated several famous players, shocking fans, so the tension of this battle is unprecedented. Both sides used long pumping and fierce attacks, and the ball seemed to be a meteor, and its speed was unparalleled. Youxin was eventually defeated by the strong enemy with a score of three to two, which can be said to be not easy. After the singles match, Dianyi fought a show, with Xue Xuchu partnering with Li Zongpei against Chuan Qifang and Lu Hanjun. The battle was wonderful, and the audience applauded and was amazed. As a result, Xue Li won with two to one. Finally, Lu Hanjun, the main force of the room, delivered a thank-you speech.</p>
<p>Singles Matchups: Lu Hanjun Defeats Zhang Ying Three -- One Fu Qifang Defeats Li Zongpei Three -- One Huang Zhijun Defeats Fang Keping Three -- One Wang Youxin Defeats Xue Xuchu Three -- Two</p>
<p>Doubles Performance: Xue Xuchu Defeats Lu Hanjun Li Zongpei Defeats Qifang Two -- One</p>
<p>Sports Miscellany</p>
<p>Circular door ball has been silent for a long time. It is heard that the foreign team is very interested in this and asked the inventor Qian Xucang to launch a league and negotiated with Qian to rent the Guoqiang Middle School Stadium for practice. Qian Jun has allowed the borrowing of the stadium, and the league is under consideration.</p>
<p>Since the Central Youth Gymnasium has stopped opening, the Nanshi Puyi Society's gymnasium has been rented by many teams and is practicing in shifts. This afternoon, there will be basketball and silk teams practicing basketball. Teams that want to borrow can contact them.</p>
<p>The Chemical Industry Sports Association is hosted by Qu Yaokang and has a small team, a table tennis team, a tennis team, etc. It has been receiving invitations from various teams recently, and it is very busy to deal with them, because the spirit of the association is better than others, and the ball skills are impressive. It is heard that the table tennis team will compete with the All-Star team at 3:00 PM this afternoon, and the Xiao Zhun team will compete with the Shell team at 5:30.</p>
<p>The 12th China-France Cup Basketball Tournament will be announced at the end of the next weekend. This Sunday (29th), Xinhua will play against Tianyi to decide the group champion. It is found that Xinhua is one of the best in the small football team and has fierce generals such as Wang Jiagu under his command.</p>
<h3>Essentials of Basketball Theory (17)</h3>
<p>— Liang Zhaoan</p>
<p>Checking the five-person zone defense method has its advantages and disadvantages. Its advantages are that it saves energy, makes it difficult for the enemy to go deep, reduces the enemy's chance of shooting near the basket, can resist the enemy's use of blocking methods to attack, can win more balls in the middle, and can quickly counterattack, especially in the ball rebounded by the baffle. However, its disadvantages are also numerous: If one person is in a zone, it is difficult to defend two enemies. If three enemies rush in at the same time, the front line will easily fall into chaos. It cannot force the other party to attack. If the other party gets a higher score and there is little time left in the game, the enemy can pass the ball in the outer circle without attacking to wait for the time to end and gain a few points of victory. In this case, even the audience feels bored. If the field is too large, it is not easy to retreat and defend, and it is easy to be attacked by the other party's rapid attack. If the field is too small, it is not easy to prevent the opponent's long-range shooting.</p>
<p>Therefore, when using the five-person zone defense method, it is necessary to understand its advantages and disadvantages before using it well to be effective. For individual defensive skills, in order to cooperate with this defensive method, the following points must be paid attention to. When the ball is lost, five people must quickly retreat and defend, and there must be no carelessness or slow intention to avoid being taken advantage of by the other party. When defending, look at the ball and not the person, which is the opposite of the "man-to-man" defense method. Depending on the direction of the ball, the front line should be shifted in advance and echo each other to avoid misunderstanding of duties, confusing the front line, or triple-teaming to control the enemy's concentrated attack.</p>
