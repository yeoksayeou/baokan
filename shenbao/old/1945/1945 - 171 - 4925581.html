<h3>冲繩南部日軍反擊　展開高地爭奪戰　航空部隊猛襲四周敵艦船</h3>
<p>東京十九日中央社電　冲繩本島南部島民地區敵軍，機續藉猛烈砲火掩護，企圖侵入日軍防禦陣地，日軍當起邀擊，展開壯烈血戰。現在敵軍進犯錢自西海岸系滿附近，經與座岳·八重瀨岳·以迄更海岸，尤以與座岳·入重瀨岳以東敵攻勢尤烈。與座岳位處系滿東方三公里，八重瀨岳連接與座岳東方，爲標高一百五十公尺之丘陸，日軍利用該兩丘陵地形，予敵重創。小祿地區戰綫在錯綜複雜之戰綫上發生混戰，日軍部隊勇戰善鬥，惟終以敵勢太盛，遂被壓縮至島尻地區及小祿地區，戰局益困難。</p>
<p>東京十九日中央社電　冲繩本島南部地區中之敵，企岡陸續南下。十六日侵入入重　岳東西之日軍陣地，深達一千五百米而寛至東海岸之仲座部落，南至入重瀨岳一帶。該地之日軍部隊刻正猛烈反攻。與敵軍激戰二晝夜，於十八日奪回入重瀨岳西南之五七高地及其南方地區，目下繼續反擊，因此東海岸方而之戰終已告安定。而中部及西海岸之戰綫無大變化，因爭奪大里南方五百米附近之高地，刻正展開局部之激戰。</p>
<p>琉球基地十九日中央社電　琉球羣島方面十八日氣侯仍惡劣，來襲之敵機約計百架，地上方面八重瀨岳方面之敵軍稍獲前進，該山頂終落入敵軍手中。日航空隊由十八日夜迄十九日晨進攻四周之敵艦船及本島之敵機塲，戰果尚未判明。</p>
<h3>日鈴木首相　闡明决勝信念　地方總監舉行首次會議</h3>
<p>東京十九日中央社電　首次地方總監會議，於十九日下午一時在首相官邸舉行，鈴木首相以次全體閣僚，及西尾關東信越總監以次八總監均行出席。首由鈴本首相訓示後，外務陸軍大藏各大臣就所管事項有所指示，最後各總監就各地域之整頓自立自戰態勢，組織國民義男隊等諸問題加以商討，曾議畢後，並赴內務省與內務當局懇談。</p>
<p>東京十九日中央社電　日鈴本首相於最近會見記者團時，曾聞明決勝之信念謂，「余對述黃島及冲繩作戰，絕無悲觀之念。換首之，土地被佔，決不能謂戰爭敗北，藍如思及較我尤甚之敵精神上所受打擊時，則此等戰役決非敗北，今後將於本州九州或其他地域決戰，而於此本土決戰集結五倍十倍於敵之軍隊，與之角逐，確信必獲勝利」。蓋首相所曾者，即土地之得失與戰果之大小，決非決定勝敗之要素，而決最後勝利者，却在國家國民之戰鬥精神也。所謂戰略要地之爭奪，固然與戰意之高低不無關係，即如歐洲柏林附近之攻防戰，因喪失該地，終致國家戰意崩壞，然如戰意頑强之得失，並非致命之處也。第一次世界大戰之末年，因魯登道夫攻勢，致巴黎於危機時，法首相克里蒙梭曾作宣傳謂，「余在巴黎前方戰鬥，且在巴黎中部戰鬥，萬一巴黎失守，則余將於巴黎之彼方作戰，於比利牛斯山亦能戰鬥而無濟於事，則於海上戰鬥」。該首相心中充滿滅敵之氣與强烈之鬥志，常時之法軍於戰鬥上雖敗北，惟此項精神與此項鬥志却未敗北。今日之冲繩戰局確告危急，然於冲繩決戰中，日軍陸海空之精銳曾予敵登陸八師中之三師以殲滅之打擊，　半減其他四師之作戰能力，敵有鬥爭能力者僅一師，敵兵死傷之數違七萬三千餘名，至力艦隊被毀五成，然陸海上之戰果雖甚擴大，尚不能謂至此而止。蓋敵於歐戰曾忍受五千萬損署，於太平洋方面亦有犧牲百萬大軍之決心也。冲繩戰繼續一刻，即可多生產擊沉敵艦於本土海面之我機一架，多築堡壘一所，冲繩方面勇士雖有力竭之一日，然共拼命精神，於來日之本土決戰時，當可化爲無形之戰也。第二，冲繩之戰所予敵精神上之打擊，實難計量，特攻隊之威力尚作別論，如以相同之兵力與之對抗，則日軍決不致成今日之戰局。敵在冲繩之兵力在質上遠不及日軍，惟在數量上優於日軍而已。但本土決戰，敵將如何彌補其質上之缺陷，於茲敵之物量戰術即有限制，此則冲繩作戰對於我人之明確教訓也。</p>
<h3>泰拉干日軍　施果敢突擊</h3>
<p>西南太平洋基地十九日中央社電　泰拉干島万面敵軍，仍繼續增援，企圖强行突破日軍第一防綫，然日軍部隊仍堅守該綫，對來攻敵軍施以猛烈反擊，並於夜問全員敢行壯烈之肉搏攻擊，予敵以甚大損害。迄今已經五十餘日，苛烈苦鬥，日守備隊已充分發揮壯烈精神。入日以來，日軍復對於婆羅乃灣拉巴安島及婆羅乃半島登陸之澳洲軍，加以果敢反擊，阻止敵軍前進，現正　戰中。</p>
<h3>美陸軍最高指揮　巴克那陣亡　美將戰死此為第十七人</h3>
<p>東京十九日中央社電　冲繩本島之敵登陸軍最高指揮官第十軍司令官巴克那中將，十七日上午於前錢指揮戰鬥中，遭受日軍砲擊，因而陣亡。此事業由關島尼米茲司令部發表。查美軍將官之戰死，此爲第十七人，在太平洋戰區中，則尚爲第四人</p>
<p>據十九日上午八時三十分夏威夷無綫電台廣播尼米茲司令部十八日下午十一時二十分之公報，巴克那於指揮海軍第八戰鬥聯隊作戰中，突於十八日下午一時十五分命中日軍之砲彈陣亡，其後任人選已定爲蓋格云。按侵寇冲繩之美陸軍，為霍奇統率之陸軍第二十四軍團及蓋格統率之第三軍團，其最高指揮官為巴克那，此後海軍第三軍團長將由蓋格指揮之。冲繩本島敵登陸以來，因日軍勇戰猛鬥，已犧牲兵力七萬三千五百名，故美國內輿論對於最高指揮字巴克那之指導作戰，極表非難。美軍事評論家洛倫斯更指責巴克那作戰之　誤，致美國民亦不愛戴之，而巴克那竟於此際以戰死聞矣。巴克那之指導作戰方式，於美軍將校中爲稀見之穩健主義者，此次於冲繩作戰時，亦採取愼重之漸進主義。四月一日美軍於冲繩登陸之際，美國內均抱樂觀見解，認爲於一二週內即可破壞日軍組織的反抗，但實際則因遭過日軍之猛烈反擊，致美軍進展阿緩，迨登陸三週後，美國內已開始批評巴克那。彼於四月二十一日會藉前綫記者向國民表明稱，美軍於三週間對日軍防禦陳地，由陸海空三方面加以鐵量攻擊，但不能效果的破壞日軍陣地，欲於堅固之防禦陣地驅出日軍，除採取拔栓式或將其逐一殲滅外，別無他法，　此爲犧牲最少而效果的戰法云。又於五月十三日重向美國民辯明稱，冲繩作戰不能期待如歐洲戰綫之顯著進擊，蓋冲繩之日軍係精神的軍隊，與此項日軍戰闘，決非容易之戰鬭云。但鑒於國內輿論極表不滿，渠於焦躁之餘，乃赴第一綫督戰，不謂竟致陳亡。</p>
<h3>敵美B29型飛機一年來之戰果與損害</h3>
<p>— 漆蠡甫</p>
<p>據美國軍事當局說明·造成總國失敗之一價直接大原因，爲前後二百七十次，總計十數萬噸，對德方煉製石汕設備實施戰略轟炸所致。至最近自歐洲戰爭結束後，B29型機空襲日本本土漸形額繁，去年六月十六日敵方自大陸對日本土空襲後，迄今已屆一載，B29型機之戰略轟炸，其成績果如何？</p>
<p>敵機損失數目</p>
<p>據大本營及其他方面發表：自去年六月十六日至本年六月三日，B29型機來襲次數共計七十一次，其中約四分之一係空襲東京附近一帶，有七百十五架爲日方制空部隊及地上部隊擊落，一千一百八十九架被擊毀，合計損害一千九百十四架。然此項數字中猶未將不能飛返基地之機數計算在內，例如自硫黃島日軍將士全體玉碎後，參加空襲本土之B29型機，時有被迫降落於硫黃島，未能飛返塞班島基地者，亦有因日方陸海軍機將敵基地炸燬，或因機件戰生陣碍而被降落於海上或大陸某處，推測亦有相當多數。</p>
<p>敵人最怕流血</p>
<p>敵美所最認爲可怖者爲疏血，如果以擊毀之機數三分之一，即一百九十二架結果被擊落計算，則連擊落之七百二十五架，共計一千一百十七架。而B29型機每架載人員計正副駕駛員二名，航空士一名，通信兼射擊手一名，轟炸兼射繫手一名，攝影兼射擊手一名，以及射堅手五名，共計十二名。如再載乘指據官編隊長則爲十三名，吾人以每架十二人計算，則已有約一萬四千名搭乘員喪失。</p>
<p>飛機補充困難</p>
<p>關於B29型之生產額，據美國戰時生產局長稱：去年十二月底，每月產　一百三十五架。嗣據舊金山廣播：今年五月德國戰敗後，每月可生產二百架以上，由此可明瞭B29型機生產未能如當初計劃時之大量。在過去一年問至多製造二千餘架而已。依照日方統計，其損失已達一千一百十七架，則其差惡僅餘八百八十三架。再每次來襲，以每月平均喪失一百三十架計算，尤以五月三日迄本月一日止，B29型機來製日本本土頻緊，綜計擊落一百五十三架，擊毀一百八十架，照上述方法計算，擊毀機數中假定約三分之一不能飛返，則在此一個月內，敵機損失約達二百十三架，其餘之一百二十架必須加以修理始可出動。去年美戰時生產局長納爾遜稱：「每次轟炸如喪失飛機二十架，則為補充計，須有工人一千人以上每星期工作四十餘小時，繼績一年之久，始可補充。」</p>
<p>龐大的製造費</p>
<p>按每架B29型機製造費需六十五萬美元，所需材料八十噸，工人約三十萬人，地上整備兵每架四十名，自馬里亞納往返東京，每具發動機以二千匹馬力，續航十五小時計算，則每架需汽汕二萬公升，三百架則需六百萬公升。普通之汽汕　約三萬罐運轍時需三噸載黨之卡車三百六十輛。再每架携帶炸彈約計七噸，三百架出動十次須帶炸彈二萬一千噸，此外並須携帶槍彈，氧氣管，糧食，被服等，假如以大批B29型機利用艦隊橫斷太平洋運至爲里亞納各基地，則更屬費事。</p>
<p>據三月二十三日路透社引第二十空軍副司令諸司泰特之誇語曰：「過去超空堡壘對日空襲所受損失極爲少數，將來對日空襲，恐益　迅速加强，B29型機之作戰，今日尚屆初期，將來必將出動一千架，實行大規模空襲」。誠然，彼稱損失極少，乃因尚在初期之故，蓋決無十架來　而擊落其十五架者。入四月以後，敵機空襲漸次熾烈，而日方地上制空兩部隊邀繫亦極猛烈，本月一日B29型機約四百架來襲大阪，日方將其擊落毀共一百三十架，已超過美國生產力以上。如諾斯泰特所稱：「何日方能出動一千架。」</p>
<p>轟炸不必驚懼</p>
<p>最近敵B29型機空襲日本土頻繁，此並不能表示馬里亞納基地已漸告準備完全，機數益見增加，其目的乃在摧毀日本國民戰意，雖然如何熾烈之轟炸，晋人亦無庸驚懼，轟炸受損害，猶如拳擊比賽時選手全身涂滿血漬之外傷而已。</p>
<h3>松平部長痛斥　敵美盲炸暴行　日舉國民衆信念益堅</h3>
<p>日本大使館上海事務所松平情報部長，於昨（十九）日下午三時，循例會見新聞記者，就敵美機之盲炸暴行，特發表談話如次：</p>
<p>盲目轟炸濫殺平民</p>
<p>最近美空軍總司令官阿諾德訪馬尼刺時，曾對今後之作戰計劃，發表若干意見，竟稱於今後之一年半間，將繼續轟炸日本，務使日本舉國人民物資及其他一切無存在之餘地云云。此種表示，實屬毫無人道之暴行。査過去美軍曾在歐戰亦實施盲目轟炸，尤其對漢堡實行所謂地毯轟炸，其第一步爲投擲巨到炸彈，使人民發生恐怖之心理，繼而在空中散佈汽油，復又投擲燒夷彈，陷成火災，當人民消防滅火活躍時，竟再投擲無數小型炸彈，濫殺平民。吾人回顧蘇聯對德國之轟炸，終不出戰術範圍，以交通綫戰略地帶爲目的，然美空軍之轟炸，則盡其野蠻殘酷之能事，若將蘇美兩國空軍相較之下，其居心與行爲如何，至爲明顯。</p>
<p>美人性格暴虐殘忍</p>
<p>關於美國人之暴虐性，從歷史上所見，已一目瞭然，如其遠代祖宗印地安人時代，早具有所謂決滅政策，以及對黑人之奴隸待遇等之行爲，可資證明，足見彼輩之性格殘忍。此次敵美機之對日本土盲炸，充滿暴露彼輩之摧殘性，如五月二十五日敵之轟炸東京，而尼米茲司令部竟公開發表美軍轟炸東京之山岳地帶，及住宅區，於此可見敵方明知該區地帶，加以盲炸，實爲有計劃之濫殺無辜民衆。在戰時法規及戰時道德上，悍然不加顧慮，故此次阿諾爾之野蠻厥詞，或許含有對日本之威嚇用意，同時又可窺見彼輩之殘虐性格。惟在日本舉國民衆益增仇恨美開，及昂揚戰意之堅强信念，誓死將英美驅逐於東亞之外。</p>
<h3>三井會社擴充　飛機生產</h3>
<p>東京十九日中央社電　日本三井株式會社總社爲費擴充飛機戰力起見，此次特積極經營該社唯一飛機生產部門之昭和飛行機公司，（資本金六千萬團，其十分之四爲三井所有）由三井派社長及董監數人，幷決定由三井造船·三幷精機·三井木材工業等關係公司，集中人物兩力予以經營。</p>
<h3>贛南地區日軍　發動急襲作戰　第七戰區渝軍基地喪失</h3>
<p>九江十九日中央社電　日華南軍十八日下午七時發表：日軍對龍南，定南，虔南地區呼號反攻之渝第七戰區軍之主力，發動急襲作戰，予以甚大打擊。按日軍於六月初即採取秘密行動，而以數縱隊由各方面開始進攻，敵軍深知此情，曾企圖退走，爲日軍之急襲所阻，予以莫大損傷，而逃向腹地深處。至此，第七戰區軍反攻之基地已完全被覆滅</p>
<p>第七戰區渝軍受挫</p>
<p>東京十九日中央社電　前於日軍打通南部粵漢綫作戰時，遭受痛擊之余漢謀麾下第七戰區軍主史，其後集結廣東省東北部及江西省南端之山岳地帶，增强陣容，同時策應最近美軍企圖大陸登陸作戰，有所蠢動。日華南軍爲先發制人，以期將之殲滅，於六月初開始新行動，由南北數方面，包圍攻擊渝軍，六日完全制壓敵據守之龍南，定南，虔南，（江西有西南部）通稱三南地區，予敵甚大打擊。同時澈底擊摧其食庫及後方戰力，更繼續迫擊向東方安遠方面潰走之渝軍，龐天戰果中。</p>
<h3>美在滇設立陸軍通訊學校</h3>
<p>中央社訊　滬市方面消息，據渝方電稱：最近駐渝美軍在雲南設立陸軍通訊學校。該校教官悉爲美國人担任，其目的以養成中國人之通信技術，並聞此類學校已分設六處</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>米糧緊急措置以後</h3>
<p>自從國府採取米糧緊急措置後，本市米價已趨穩定，並見回抵。如霉雨稍止，則來源可暢，米價下跌，自極可能。可是，我們並不能坐待米價自然下跌，可能下跌的環境雖已造成，可能下跌的條件雖已具備，然而，怎樣利用環境？怎樣把握條件？使可能下跌從速實現，則還待我們進一步的努力，也就是在當局緊急措置以後，第二步的主要工作。</p>
<p>什麽是第二步的主要工作呢？我們認爲下列數事，亟需注意：</p>
<p>疏暢米糧來源，使供應充裕，當然最關切要。首先在運輸方面，增加交通工具，對米糧優先　運，給予充分便利，都有賴於運輸機關的努力協助。盟邦當局已經懇切聲明盡力協助運數，對於運輸歡量希望及早放寬。</p>
<p>嚴禁沿途關卡需索與疏通來源最有連帶關係，如果沿途需索重重，剝削層層，則縱有大量運輸工具，販運者也必視爲畏途。同時，販運者雖能恐痛應付沿途需索，而必將沿途支出完全加之於成本，所謂「羊毛出在羊身上」，產地與市塲米價形成高度差額，這是過去的普遍情形。不過，過去因爲米糧移動限制，沿途關卡軍警人員乃有需索的藉口，現在移動限制旣經撤銷，則自由阪運，完全是合法行爲，關卡軍警當然再無需索藉口，絕對不能利用職權，要挾需索。我們希望各有關當局對於此事，出示布告，從嚴禁止。販運米糧者如遇不法需索，儘可拒絕並檢舉告發，俾予嚴懲。</p>
<p>防止囤積操縱，也須隨時嚴密注意。收買機關停止收買，撤銷移動限制，無非是疏通來源。增加運輸數量，嚴禁沿途需索，又無非是便利販運，以期疏通來源，而疏通來源之目的，常然是充裕供應，抑低米價。可是，來源疏通的員的誠然達到了，却被不法商人大部分蒐購囤積，則將畫虎不成反類犬了。換言之，不法商人對於疏通來源的目的，非爲供應民食，而爲便利囤積居奇；這樣，疏通來源的結果，民食未得開節，却多了幾價團戶。這種可能的弊寳，足使當局苦心的措置，未能獲致成效，而民生的痛苦未能得到解除。因此，防止大戶囤積，實爲不可忽視而必須隨時嚴防的要着。前天周兼總裁發表談話，已令金融檢查處檢査各銀行供給採米資金，是否用途正當，這也是預防囤積的一端。</p>
<p>限制過量存糧，亦極重要，一般當戶及工商團體，乘米價下回，大量購存，縱其目的與囤積居奇有別，但使米糧偏集失却調節性能則一。因此，對於米源疏通後，大戶競購一點，自當設法防止。在積極方面，應由市府重申前令，存糧不得超過三月所需，查出逾量，即以充公平　。同時盼市民檢舉，政府執行，以儆效尤。消極方面，深盼富有人士稍明大義，少數人飽而多數人餓，絕非社會安定現象。况且，富人囤糧，除怕糧荒外，無非免吃高價之虧，則試問一旦果眞高價，富人固有存糧，可以置身事外，而窮人又怎樣應付呢？我們相信唯富人最聰明，但也應設身處地爲大衆設想，不要一味爲自已打算盤，才是眞正聰明。</p>
<p>總之，在此米糧問題嚴重之際，差幸當局重視民生，已有緊急對策，凡我朝野人士，均當一本天良，共同協力以期整個解決。一般市民雖無從校極協力，但應從消極方面解除恐慌心理。軍警及公務人員，應從旁協力，絕對不應利用職機，作庇袒及索詐行爲。而有力商人，尤須自捫天良，運用資力，正當販運，祗取合法利酒，不　居奇暴利，大家以挽救民食恐慌爲己任。如在這次緊急措置中，仍有不法暴利舉動，一經査實，尤當爲衆所唾棄，並處以戰時極刑，藉爲無心肝味天良者知所烟戒！</p>
<p>譯論</p>
<h3>米糧緊急措置的效果</h3>
<p>最近，國民政府施行米糧緊急措置，停止米統會及其他機關的米糧收買工作，並撤廢米糧移動限制，此事早有報道。上述施策，各方面頗表好感，一致歡迎。上海及他處的食糧不安，由此將可完全消弭。</p>
<p>以前已屢次論列，現在的米價高漲，一半出於心理的條件，實際上，米糧及其來源，未必已告無望。因此，若能取消心理上的條件，米價必可低落，恐慌和競購的現象，亦可減少，縱然米糧的運入量不曾急激增大，米價也可抑低到某種程度。米糧緊急措置公布以後，由於降雨及其他條件，運入上海的米糧，團然未必增加，唯米價已相當回落，此點正可證實上述的情形，而緊急措置今後的作用，由此亦足想像得之。</p>
<p>米糧緊急措置，一方面減低上海的米價，一方面也將提高產地米價業某種程度。上海與產地的米價如得平街，則其結果，農民必增加其增產的意圖，此事殆無疑義。然而，雖云能得均衡，實際上自亦有其限度。諸如米商籌集資金的限度，其所付高利息，以及米糧通路的苛捐雜稅，米商貪婪的厚利等，均可使產地和上海的市價，依然懸殊。但國府的施策苟得其宜，則此問題亦司相當糾正。繼緊急措置之後，國府的施策，當然應向上述方面推進。</p>
<p>緊急措置的實施，將促進一般米商廣汎的自由活動。他們將積極深入內地，從事購米，並與上海的市價比較，合算則採運來滬，不合算則囤積起來，這種結果的產生，自屬預料中的事情。過去的囤積，行於上海或其附近，今後的囤積，則將發生於米產地，此點亦須攷慮。因此，國府須以華中全體爲對象，覓取防止囤積的方策。否則，即不能取締奸商，同時緊急措置亦難見其美滿之結果。</p>
<p>米糧緊急措置，結果就是放棄對於米糧的一般統制。至其本質，我們希望純屬緊急措置，即是暫時的方策。此點申報社諭亦嘗言及之，並强調米糧統制是必要的，唯院制的內容須適合中國的國情民情，這是可以傾聽的話。率直言之，過去的米糧統制，犯有不少錯誤。而今日的米糧狀况，亦可視爲乃其錯誤　積而成的結果。總之，統制的方式首須變革。</p>
<p>社會對於此次的緊急措置，一般的印象極爲良好。米價暴騰的心理條件取消時，國府進而覓取有關下列各點的積極方策，實有必要。即：立刻禁止軍警及公務員的不法徵稅，並澈廢取締奸商的暴利行為與囤積等。為使緊急措置的效果臻於完美起見，此非斷然實現不可。（譯自六月十八日大陸新報）</p>

<h3>十六名波領袖　在莫斯科受審　均被控危害蘇軍罪</h3>
<p>瑞典京城十九日中央社電　據莫斯科電訊稱：在燈燭輝煌之莫斯科商業公會大禮堂上，十六名波蘭領袖在陸軍少將奧古立基引領之下，開始受審，彼等均彼控為犯怠工恐　蘇軍官員，使用不法無機電作傳訊工作，及作種種反蘇宣傳運動等罪名，奧古立基陸軍少將亦被控爲問諜罪犯。然出席受訊之彼被告者僅有十五名·其中一名貝達克（波社會主義黨黨員）因病缺席。農民黨執行部要員斯蒂普洛斯基在被審訊時開始激烈抗辯，同時奧古立基陸軍少將亦於罪狀寫供時，怒聲抗駁謂，「我實無罪，然僅在供詞之內被認爲有罪耳。」渠言罷急起立，聲稱欲呼出渠之見證人，一時喊出一串軍人之名字。刑庭首席審判官烏里赫將軍因鑒於此，乃急問「此項設人何在，」渠答謂，「我不知彼等確實之所在地，彼等或在蘇軍之集中營內或在獄中。」除烏里赫將軍之外，尚有陸單官三人，檢察官爲阿芬奈西夫，渠曾爲穌軍軍法處長，同時被告等之辯護律師七名，在勃洛特領率之下，亦同時出席。其時被告之罪狀由檢察官朗朗宣讀，略謂，「奧古立基等各被告均已承認渠等曾領導在波蘭國內組織一秘密政府，然該政府之組織，實受倫敦波流亡政府所指使也。且奧古立基曾受倫敦波流亡政府之教唆，將波蘭國軍解散，同時擄獲一般波軍官員及奪得大批東械及無綫電等，藉此項利器而想嚇蘇軍，或對蘇聯作種種反官傳運動。奧古立基實係前波蘭秘書政府總司令高莫洛斯基將軍之私人代表。按高氏曾於去年率領組織未成之華沙政府，企圖攫取政權，同時奧古立基亦曾領導一般恐怖份子，在一九四四年七月二十八日至一九四五年五月三十一日間，殺　蘇軍將校五百九十四名，擊傷二百四十九名，且渠復承認曾於愛沙尼亞組織秘密機關，對蘇聯作各種有害之舉動。」同時該罪狀復宣佈稱，「此項被控吿之波蘭罪犯，確已承認渠等之不法舉動，例如受倫敦波流亡政府之敎唆，而領導民衆組織不法之秘密機關，且渠等亦曾承認，對一切過去不法行為俱負責」云云。</p>

<h3>英美謀略戰的分析——利用電波擾亂德國民心</h3>
<p>為理解這次歐洲大戰起見，須知促成戰事結束的，不但是表面上可見的武力戰·經濟戰，就是在其背面的宣傳謀略戰，也是奮力的武器。德皇威廉二世曾經說過，前次大戰德國所以失敗，原因在於英國的官傳戰。今日，以擅於宣傳戰見稱的納粹德國，又爲英美的宣傳所乘。這個事實，對於指望完遂大東亞戰爭的我們，不是他山之石嗎？現在，且把歐戰內面所有種種複雜的悄形，摭述其片段於后。</p>
<p>英美的宣傳戰</p>
<p>英美知道納粹德國的國民組織非帶嚴密，沒有間諜活動的餘地，所以一待第二戰綫開關成功，紅軍的攻勢劇烈起來的時候，即刻展開白熱化的電波戰，圖謀喚起德國國內的失敗主義思想，使其內部自起分化作用。他們在倫敦截收德國的廣播，巧妙地加以改變，再用同一周波轉播德國，使德國的無綫電收聽者無從明白它是德國的新聞，抑是英國的播音，而在其間巧妙地實行反德宜傳。對於供給新聞的短波無綫電，也用同樣的方法，從中搗亂，以致德國的報紙往往上了他們的當，登出不確的消息。英美宣傳方法的巧妙毒辣，由此可知。</p>
<p>一月十八日，邱吉爾在下院中演說，提及無條件投降的方式。自此以後，英美就置重點於此事，反復廣播，不斷向德國人說：「我們是深信和平及自由的人。我們要從今日混亂。飢餓和血腥的糾紛中，建立和平自由的機構。」並用種種甜言蜜語，暗示他們有休戰的意思。因此，對於高喊嚴守國際法的英美，德國國民在蘇聯的猛攻之下，認爲他們仍是德國的朋友，將來一定可以聯合起來打倒蘇聯。這種美好的觀測，到了大戰的末期，和新兵器的出現同樣成爲德國民衆牢固的希望。這種傾向，後來終於波及德國政府內部。希特勒歿後，希姆萊。杜尼資等在外交上所犯的錯誤——即對英美停戰，對蘇抗戰——就是出於這種緣故。</p>
<p>而且，英美的謀略官傳，直到最後還不放鬆一步。例如紅軍開始對柏林實行總攻時，艾森霍華司令部就反復用德語俄語廣播道：「蘇聯士兵，停止東綫的暴行掠奪吧！那會使德國國民加强鬥志的。」聽起來彷彿英美倒是同悄德人捍衛國土，不滿意於紅軍暴虐行爲似的。於是德國民衆間，有許多中了他們的奸計，紛紛逃到英美軍隊佔領下的地方去。這件事實，也可證明在精神上，德國國民是敗於英美宣傳戰的。</p>
<p>德國的新兵器</p>
<p>德國的民衆，一直到最後，始終堅信新兵器的出現定可挽回敗局。然則，德國究竟有沒有兵器呢？據情新報稱，德國確有新的兵器，只要稍稍假以時日，即可出現。</p>
<p>第一項可以舉出來的，是電波放射器。這是一種殺人光綫，它的放射範國，在地上和空中，可及一千二百公尺之處。據說：「飛機遭此光綫，立即焚毀，戰車遇此光綫，內部也會發生爆炸。」德國正在研究擴大其勢力圈，使它的有效距離能够達到七千公尺，可惜各種工廠受到轟炸而破壞，以致未能及時大量生產。</p>
<p>第二種是高速度飛機。德國因爲缺乏汽汕，所以竭力想發明一種不用汽油的發動機，據說「由氧氣爆發而推進的噴射戰鬥機，已經硏究成功。」它的速度，據說比音響的傳播更快。本年春季以降，業已實際應用，活躍於柏林東方，可惜也不能够大量生產。大體上，它是一種子母飛機，即在大的飛機上帶着小的飛機，飛到適當的地方，將小飛機放出來，用無綫電操縱它，從事邀擊敵方轟炸機或轟炸敵方都市。然而，這並不能左右戰局的大勢。</p>
<p>總之，新兵器並不是奇蹟，它是高度的科學水準和不斷和努力結晶而成的。其性能縱然非常優秀，若不大量生產，也是無從發揮其威力的。這點就是歐洲大戰給我們的敎訓。</p>
<p>英美軍的殘暴</p>
<p>英美軍戰鬥時，做他們的擋箭牌者，便是黑人兵。美軍的指揮將校，稱黑人兵爲活動障礙物。對於黑人兵的死傷，無論怎樣衆多，也和彈藥的消耗一般，在他們是亳不介意的。這一點，正足暴露滿口人道自由的英美非人道主義的本質。然而，黑人兵也是血迷了心的，只要給他們片刻的享樂，即肯忍受困苦的戰綫生活。英芙看準了黑人這種弱點，爲驅使他們起見，默許搶刦德國民衆，甚至密令准許黑人兵暴行。司是，美軍當局事後又照軍法處死遵令而行的黑人，因而不知其內幕的人，往往以爲美軍的軍紀確實嚴肅整飭。其實呢，却是犧牲黑人來達到其目的。至於美兵本身，其行爲如何呢？別的不要設，單就美眾駐在倫敦時的行徑而觀，不也爲了風化案子而幾乎鬧出嚴重的外交問題嗎？</p>
<p>英美機羣實行空襲時，往往在燒夷彈之外，再撒下大量的生硫黃，使地上發生毒瓦斯。又在轟炸而引起火災時，傾下許多汽汕，以圖將地上的老百姓完全燒死，因此而犧牲的，單在特勒斯登一市，即達四萬人。（譯自每日新聞）</p>

<h3>Japanese Counterattack in Southern Okinawa: Fierce Battle for High Ground, Air Force Strikes Enemy Ships Nearby</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) - In the southern part of Okinawa Island, enemy forces continue to attempt to infiltrate Japanese defense lines under the cover of intense artillery fire. Japanese forces are engaging in a counterattack, resulting in fierce and bloody battles. The enemy's advance is focused on the area near Itoman on the west coast, stretching through Mount Yaeza, Mount Yaeze, and as far as the coast. The enemy's offensive is particularly fierce east of Mount Yaeza and Mount Yaeze. Mount Yaeza is located three kilometers east of Itoman, and Mount Yaeze, connected to the east of Mount Yaeza, is a hill with an elevation of 150 meters. Japanese forces are using the terrain of these two hills to inflict heavy damage on the enemy. On the Oroku front, fierce fighting is occurring amidst complex battle lines. Japanese units are fighting bravely and skillfully, but they are being pushed back towards the Shimajiri and Oroku areas due to the overwhelming enemy forces, making the situation increasingly difficult.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) - The enemy in the southern part of Okinawa Island continues to land reinforcements. On the 16th, they infiltrated Japanese positions east and west of Mount Yaeze, penetrating 1,500 meters deep and stretching from the Nakaza village on the east coast to the Mount Yaeze area in the south. Japanese units in the area are currently engaged in a fierce counterattack. After two days and nights of intense fighting, they recaptured Hill 57 southwest of Mount Yaeze and the area south of it on the 18th. The counterattack continues, and the battle on the eastern coast has stabilized. There have been no major changes on the central and west coast fronts, but local fierce fighting is underway for the high ground about 500 meters south of Ozato.</p>
<p>Ryukyu Base, 19th (Central News Agency) - The weather in the Ryukyu Islands remained poor on the 18th. Approximately 100 enemy aircraft attacked. On the ground, enemy forces on Mount Yaeze gained some ground, and the summit of the mountain eventually fell into enemy hands. From the night of the 18th to the morning of the 19th, the Japanese Air Force attacked enemy ships in the surrounding area and enemy airfields on the island. The results of the battle are not yet clear.</p>
<h3>Prime Minister Suzuki Clarifies Determination to Win, Prefectural Governors Hold First Meeting</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) - The first meeting of prefectural governors was held at the Prime Minister's official residence at 1:00 PM on the 19th. Prime Minister Suzuki, all cabinet members, and the eight governors, including Nishio, Governor of Kanto-Shinetsu, attended. Prime Minister Suzuki first gave instructions, followed by instructions from the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Army, and Finance on matters under their jurisdiction. Finally, the governors discussed issues such as reorganizing each region, establishing self-sufficiency and self-defense capabilities, and organizing national volunteer corps. After the meeting, they went to the Ministry of Home Affairs for discussions with the relevant authorities.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) - Prime Minister Suzuki recently stated his determination to win when meeting with a group of reporters: "I have absolutely no pessimistic thoughts regarding the battles of Iwo Jima and Okinawa. In other words, the occupation of territory does not necessarily mean defeat in war. When considering the psychological impact on the enemy, who is even more distressed than us, these battles are by no means defeats. We will fight the decisive battle on the mainland, Kyushu, or other regions, concentrating five or ten times the enemy's forces for this homeland defense, and I am confident that we will achieve victory." What the Prime Minister meant is that the gain or loss of territory and the scale of the battle results are not decisive factors in determining victory or defeat, but that the fighting spirit of the nation and its people will determine the final victory. While the struggle for strategic locations is undoubtedly related to the level of fighting spirit, as seen in the battle near Berlin in Europe, the loss of that city ultimately led to the collapse of the nation's fighting spirit. However, a tenacious fighting spirit means that gains and losses are not fatal. At the end of World War I, when the Ludendorff Offensive brought Paris to the brink of crisis, French Prime Minister Clemenceau proclaimed, "I will fight in front of Paris, and I will fight in the center of Paris. If Paris falls, I will fight beyond Paris, and if fighting in the Pyrenees Mountains is useless, then I will fight at sea." The Prime Minister's heart was filled with the desire to destroy the enemy and a strong fighting spirit. Although the French army often suffered defeats in battle, this spirit and this fighting spirit never failed. Today, the situation in the Battle of Okinawa is undoubtedly critical, but in the decisive battle on Okinawa, the elite of the Japanese army, navy, and air force have inflicted a devastating blow on three of the eight enemy divisions that landed, reducing the combat capabilities of the other four divisions by half. The enemy has suffered over 73,000 casualties, and five-tenths of their fleet has been destroyed. However, even with the expansion of land and sea victories, this cannot be considered the end. The enemy endured 50 million casualties in the European war and is prepared to sacrifice millions of soldiers in the Pacific. Every moment that the Battle of Okinawa continues allows us to produce one more aircraft to sink enemy ships in our home waters and build one more fortress. Although the brave warriors on Okinawa may reach their limits one day, their spirit of fighting to the death will be transformed into an intangible force in the decisive battle on the mainland in the future. Secondly, the psychological impact of the Battle of Okinawa on the enemy is immeasurable. Leaving aside the power of the Special Attack Units (Kamikaze), if we were to confront them with the same forces, the Japanese army would not have reached the current situation. The quality of the enemy's forces on Okinawa is far inferior to that of the Japanese army, but they are superior in quantity. However, in the decisive battle on the mainland, how will the enemy compensate for their qualitative deficiencies? This is where the enemy's material warfare tactics are limited. This is a clear lesson for us from the Battle of Okinawa.</p>
<h3>Japanese Forces in Tarakan Launch Daring Raids</h3>
<p>Southwest Pacific Base, 19th (Central News Agency) - Enemy forces on Tarakan Island continue to reinforce their troops, attempting to forcibly break through the Japanese army's first line of defense. However, Japanese units are steadfastly holding the line, launching fierce counterattacks against the attacking enemy forces. At night, they are carrying out daring and heroic close-quarters combat attacks, inflicting significant damage on the enemy. For over fifty days, the arduous and difficult struggle has continued, and the Japanese garrison has fully demonstrated its heroic spirit. Since entering the region, Japanese forces have also launched daring counterattacks against the Australian forces that landed on Labuan Island in Brunei Bay and the Brunei Peninsula, preventing the enemy's advance and currently engaging in fierce fighting.</p>
<h3>U.S. Army's Top Commander, Buckner, Killed in Action; This is the 17th U.S. General to Die</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) - Lieutenant General Buckner, commander of the Tenth Army and the highest commander of the enemy landing forces on Okinawa Island, was killed in action on the morning of the 17th while commanding combat operations at the front line, after being hit by Japanese artillery fire. This was announced by Nimitz Headquarters in Guam. Buckner's death marks the seventeenth U.S. general to be killed in action, and the fourth in the Pacific Theater.</p>
<p>According to an announcement from Nimitz Headquarters broadcast by Hawaiian Radio Station at 8:30 AM on the 19th, Buckner was killed at 1:15 PM on the 18th when a Japanese artillery shell hit him while he was commanding the Navy's Eighth Combat Regiment. It has been decided that Geiger will be his successor. The U.S. Army forces invading Okinawa are the 24th Army Corps led by Hodge and the 3rd Marine Amphibious Corps led by Geiger, with Buckner as the supreme commander. Since the enemy landed on Okinawa Island, the Japanese army's brave and fierce fighting has resulted in 73,500 enemy casualties. As a result, public opinion in the United States has been highly critical of Buckner's leadership in combat operations. U.S. military commentator Lawrence has even criticized Buckner's operational errors, leading to a lack of affection for him among the American people. Buckner's death in battle occurred at this juncture. Buckner's operational style was seen as unusually conservative among U.S. military officers. He adopted a cautious, gradualist approach during the Okinawa operation. When U.S. forces landed on Okinawa on April 1st, there was optimism in the United States, with the belief that the Japanese army's organized resistance could be broken within one or two weeks. However, the fierce resistance from the Japanese army slowed the U.S. advance, and criticism of Buckner began in the United States after three weeks of landings. On April 21st, he addressed the nation through frontline reporters, stating that the U.S. military had launched ironclad attacks on the Japanese defensive positions from land, sea, and air for three weeks, but had not been able to effectively break through the Japanese positions. He said that to drive the Japanese army out of their fortified defensive positions, there was no other way but to adopt a corkscrew method or annihilate them one by one, which was the most effective tactic with the least amount of sacrifice. On May 13th, he reiterated to the American people that they should not expect the Okinawa operation to progress as significantly as the European front, as the Japanese army on Okinawa was a "spiritual army," and fighting this kind of Japanese army was not an easy battle. However, in light of the great dissatisfaction in domestic public opinion, he became impatient and went to the front line to supervise the battle, leading to his death.</p>
<h3>The Results and Damage of Enemy U.S. B-29 Aircraft in the Past Year</h3>
<p>— Qi Li-fu</p>
<p>According to the U.S. military authorities, one of the most direct and significant causes of Germany's failure was the strategic bombing of German oil refining facilities, which totaled over 270 raids and tens of thousands of tons of bombs. Recently, since the end of the war in Europe, B-29 aircraft air raids on the Japanese mainland have gradually increased in frequency. It has been a year since the enemy's air raids on the Japanese mainland from the continent on June 16th of last year. What has been the result of the strategic bombing by B-29 aircraft?</p>
<p>Number of Enemy Aircraft Lost</p>
<p>According to announcements from the Imperial Headquarters and other sources, from June 16th of last year to June 3rd of this year, B-29 aircraft have attacked a total of 71 times, of which about a quarter were air raids on the Tokyo area. 715 aircraft were shot down by Japanese air defense forces and ground units, and 1,189 were destroyed. The total damage is 1,914 aircraft. However, this number does not include the number of aircraft that could not return to base. For example, after the Japanese soldiers on Iwo Jima were all killed in action, B-29 aircraft participating in air raids on the mainland were sometimes forced to land on Iwo Jima and could not return to their bases on Saipan. Also, some enemy bases were destroyed by Japanese army and navy aircraft, or aircraft were forced to land at sea or somewhere on the continent due to mechanical failures or combat damage. It is estimated that there were quite a few of these as well.</p>
<p>The Enemy Fears Bloodshed Most</p>
<p>What the enemy Americans fear most is bloodshed. If we calculate that one-third of the destroyed aircraft, i.e., 192 aircraft, were shot down, then the total number of aircraft shot down is 1,117 (725 + 192). Each B-29 aircraft carries two pilots, one flight engineer, one communications and gunner, one bombardier and gunner, one photographer and gunner, and five gunners, for a total of twelve people. If a squadron leader or formation leader is also on board, then there are thirteen people. If we calculate twelve people per aircraft, then approximately 14,000 crew members have been lost.</p>
<p>Aircraft Replacements Are Difficult</p>
<p>Regarding the production volume of the B-29, the director of the U.S. War Production Board stated that at the end of December last year, the monthly production was 135 aircraft. Later, San Francisco radio broadcasted that after Germany's defeat in May of this year, monthly production could exceed 200 aircraft. This shows that the production of B-29 aircraft did not reach the originally planned large scale. In the past year, at most a little over 2,000 aircraft have been manufactured. According to Japanese statistics, 1,117 have already been lost, leaving a difference of only 883 aircraft. Furthermore, if we calculate an average loss of 130 aircraft per month, especially from May 3rd to June 1st, the frequency of B-29 aircraft attacks on the Japanese mainland has been very high. A total of 153 aircraft were shot down and 180 were destroyed. Using the above method of calculation, assuming that about one-third of the destroyed aircraft could not return, then the enemy lost about 213 aircraft in this one month. The remaining 120 aircraft must be repaired before they can be used again. Nelson, the director of the U.S. War Production Board, stated last year, "If 20 aircraft are lost in each bombing raid, then to replenish them, it would require over 1,000 workers working 40 or more hours per week for a year."</p>
<p>Huge Manufacturing Costs</p>
<p>The manufacturing cost of each B-29 aircraft is $650,000, requiring 80 tons of materials and about 300,000 workers. Each aircraft requires 40 ground maintenance personnel. For a round trip from the Marianas to Tokyo, each engine, with 2,000 horsepower, requires 20,000 liters of gasoline if it continues for 15 hours. 300 aircraft require 6 million liters. Ordinary gasoline requires about 30,000 cans, and transporting them requires 360 trucks with a load capacity of three tons. In addition, each aircraft carries about seven tons of bombs, and 300 aircraft carrying out ten sorties require 21,000 tons of bombs. In addition, they must also carry ammunition, oxygen tanks, food, clothing, etc. If a large number of B-29 aircraft are transported across the Pacific Ocean to the bases in the Marianas using a fleet, it is even more troublesome.</p>
<p>On March 23rd, Reuters quoted Second Air Force Deputy Commander General Streit as boasting, "The Superfortress has suffered extremely few losses in past air raids on Japan, and future air raids on Japan will probably be even more rapid and intensified. The B-29's operation is still in its early stages, and in the future, 1,000 aircraft will be dispatched to carry out large-scale air raids." Indeed, he said that the losses were extremely few because it was still in the early stages, as it is impossible to have ten raids and have fifteen aircraft shot down. After April, the enemy's air raids gradually intensified, and the Japanese ground and air defense units' interception was also extremely fierce. On the first of this month, about 400 B-29 aircraft attacked Osaka, and the Japanese shot down and destroyed a total of 130 aircraft, exceeding the U.S. production capacity. As Norstedt said, "How will we be able to dispatch 1,000 aircraft one day?"</p>
<p>No Need to Panic About Bombing</p>
<p>Recently, enemy B-29 aircraft have been frequently attacking the Japanese mainland. This does not mean that the bases in the Marianas have been fully prepared or that the number of aircraft has increased. Their purpose is to destroy the Japanese people's will to fight. However, no matter how fierce the bombing is, people do not need to panic. The damage from bombing is like the superficial wounds of a boxer covered in blood during a boxing match.</p>
<h3>Minister Matsudaira Denounces Enemy American Indiscriminate Bombing Atrocities, Japanese National Belief Strengthened</h3>
<p>Matsudaira, Information Minister of the Japanese Embassy's Shanghai Office, met with newspaper reporters yesterday (the 19th) at 3:00 PM, as usual, and issued the following statement regarding the enemy American aircraft's indiscriminate bombing atrocities:</p>
<p>Indiscriminate Bombing and Slaughter of Civilians</p>
<p>Recently, U.S. Air Force Commander General Arnold, during a visit to Manila, made some remarks about future operational plans, stating that they would continue to bomb Japan for the next year and a half, making it so that the Japanese people, materials, and everything else would have no room to exist. This kind of statement is truly an inhumane atrocity. In the past, the U.S. military also carried out indiscriminate bombing in the European war, especially the so-called carpet bombing of Hamburg. The first step was to drop huge bombs to cause psychological terror to the people, then gasoline was spread in the air, and incendiary bombs were dropped to cause fires. When the people were actively fighting the fires, countless small bombs were dropped again to indiscriminately kill civilians. When we look back at the Soviet Union's bombing of Germany, it never went beyond the scope of tactics, targeting transportation lines and strategic areas. However, the U.S. Air Force's bombing exhausted all its barbaric and cruel abilities. Comparing the Soviet and American air forces, their intentions and actions are very clear.</p>
<p>Americans' Brutal and Cruel Nature</p>
<p>Regarding the American people's brutality, it is clear from history. As seen in the era of their distant ancestors, the Native Americans, they already had the so-called extermination policy, as well as the treatment of black slaves, which can be used as proof, showing that these people are cruel in nature. This time, the enemy American aircraft's indiscriminate bombing of the Japanese mainland fully exposes their destructive nature. For example, on May 25th, the enemy bombed Tokyo, and Nimitz Headquarters openly announced that the U.S. military bombed the mountainous areas and residential areas of Tokyo. From this, it can be seen that the enemy clearly knew these areas and carried out indiscriminate bombing with the planned slaughter of innocent civilians. They brazenly disregarded wartime regulations and wartime ethics. Therefore, Arnold's barbaric remarks may contain the intention of threatening Japan, and at the same time, they reveal their cruel nature. However, the Japanese people are increasingly increasing their hatred of the United States and Great Britain, and their strong belief in raising their fighting spirit, vowing to expel the British and Americans from East Asia.</p>
<h3>Mitsui Company Expands Aircraft Production</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) - In order to expand aircraft war capabilities, Mitsui &amp; Co., Ltd. has decided to actively manage Showa Aircraft Company, its sole aircraft production division (capital of 60 million yen, of which four-tenths is owned by Mitsui). Mitsui is dispatching several directors and supervisors, and has decided to concentrate personnel and resources from related companies such as Mitsui Shipbuilding, Mitsui Seiki, and Mitsui Lumber Industries to manage it.</p>
<h3>Japanese Forces in Southern Jiangxi Launch Surprise Attack, 7th War Area Base Lost</h3>
<p>Jiujiang, 19th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Southern China Army announced at 7:00 PM on the 18th that the Japanese army launched a surprise attack on the main force of the Chongqing 7th War Area Army, which was calling for a counterattack in the Longnan, Dingnan, and Qiannan areas, inflicting significant damage. The Japanese army took secret action in early June and began advancing from various directions with several columns. The enemy forces were well aware of this and attempted to retreat, but were obstructed by the Japanese army's surprise attack, suffering great losses and fleeing deep into the interior. As a result, the base of the Chongqing 7th War Area Army's counterattack has been completely destroyed.</p>
<p>Chongqing 7th War Area Army Suffers Setback</p>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) - The main force of the 7th War Area Army under the command of Yu Hanmou, which suffered heavy blows during the Japanese army's operation to open the southern Guangzhou-Hankou Railway line, later gathered in the mountainous areas of northeastern Guangdong Province and the southern tip of Jiangxi Province, strengthening its ranks and conspiring with the recent U.S. military's attempt to land on the mainland, showing signs of activity. The Japanese Southern China Army launched a new operation in early June to preemptively strike and annihilate them. The Japanese army surrounded and attacked the Chongqing army from several directions, completely suppressing Longnan, Dingnan, and Qiannan (the southwestern part of Jiangxi), commonly known as the "Three Southern Areas," inflicting significant damage on the enemy. At the same time, they thoroughly destroyed their food depots and rear echelon capabilities, and continued to pursue the Chongqing army that was fleeing eastward towards Anyuan, achieving vast battlefield results.</p>
<h3>U.S. Establishes Army Communications School in Yunnan</h3>
<p>Central News Agency - Shanghai news reports, according to telegrams from Chongqing: Recently, the U.S. military stationed in Chongqing established an Army Communications School in Yunnan. All instructors at the school are Americans, and its purpose is to train Chinese communications technicians. It is reported that six such schools have been established in different locations.</p>

<h3>After the Emergency Rice and Grain Measures</h3>
<p>Since the National Government adopted emergency rice and grain measures, the price of rice in this city has tended to stabilize and has seen a rebound. If the mold rain stops slightly, the source can be smooth, and the rice price falls, which is very likely. However, we cannot sit and wait for the price of rice to fall naturally. Although the environment that may fall has been created, and the conditions that may fall have been met, how to use the environment? How to grasp the conditions? To realize the possible fall as soon as possible still requires our further efforts, which is the second main task after the emergency measures of the authorities.</p>
<p>What is the main task of the second step? We believe that the following matters need to be paid close attention to:</p>
<p>It is of course most important to dredge the source of rice and grain and make the supply abundant. First of all, in terms of transportation, increasing transportation vehicles, giving priority to the transportation of rice and grain, and giving full convenience all depend on the efforts and assistance of the transportation authorities. Allied authorities have earnestly stated that they will do their best to assist in the number of transports, and hope to relax the amount of transport as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Strictly prohibiting extortion at checkpoints along the way is most closely related to dredging the source. If there are heavy demands along the way and layers of exploitation, even if there are a large number of transportation vehicles, traffickers will regard it as a daunting task. At the same time, although traffickers can painfully cope with the demands along the way, they will inevitably add all the expenses along the way to the cost. As the saying goes, "the wool comes from the sheep." The high price difference between the place of origin and the market is a common situation in the past. However, in the past, due to restrictions on the movement of rice and grain, military and police personnel at checkpoints along the way had an excuse to demand extortion. Now that the restrictions on movement have been lifted, free trafficking is completely legal. Of course, military and police at checkpoints have no excuse to demand extortion, and absolutely cannot use their powers to coerce and demand extortion. We hope that the relevant authorities will issue a notice on this matter and strictly prohibit it. Traffickers of rice and grain may refuse and report any illegal demands and report them for severe punishment.</p>
<p>Preventing hoarding and manipulation must also be closely monitored at all times. The suspension of purchases by purchasing agencies and the cancellation of restrictions on movement are nothing more than dredging the source. Increasing the amount of transportation, strictly prohibiting extortion along the way, and nothing more than facilitating trafficking, in order to dredge the source, and the purpose of dredging the source is of course to enrich the supply and suppress the price of rice. However, if the purpose of dredging the source is indeed achieved, but most of it is collected and hoarded by illegal merchants, then it will be like drawing a tiger that does not look like a dog. In other words, the purpose of illegal merchants for dredging the source is not to supply people with food, but to facilitate hoarding and speculating. In this way, as a result of dredging the source, the people have not been able to open their savings, but there are more than a few price groups. This possible drawback can make the authorities' painstaking measures fail to achieve results, and the people's suffering cannot be alleviated. Therefore, preventing large households from hoarding is an important task that cannot be ignored and must be strictly prevented at all times. The day before yesterday, President Zhou also made a speech and ordered the Financial Inspection Office to inspect whether the funds provided by the banks for purchasing rice were used properly, which is also one end of preventing hoarding.</p>
<p>Limiting excessive grain storage is also extremely important. Ordinary households and industrial and commercial groups take advantage of the return of rice prices and purchase and store a large amount. Even if the purpose is different from hoarding and speculation, the concentration of rice and grain and the loss of regulatory performance are the same. Therefore, after the source of rice is dredged, the rush to purchase by large households should be prevented. On the active side, the municipal government should reiterate the previous order that the amount of grain stored should not exceed the needs of three months, and if the excess is found, it will be filled with fairness. At the same time, I hope that the citizens will report it, the government will enforce it, and warn others. On the passive side, I sincerely hope that the wealthy people will understand the righteousness, and it is by no means a phenomenon of social stability for a few people to be full and most people to be hungry. Moreover, the wealthy people hoard grain, except for fear of grain shortage, nothing more than to avoid the loss of eating high prices, then ask how the poor should cope once the prices are really high? We believe that only the rich are the smartest, but they should also put themselves in the shoes of the public and think about themselves, and not just think about their own calculations, which is really smart.</p>
<p>In short, at this critical moment of the rice and grain problem, it is fortunate that the authorities attach importance to people's livelihood and have emergency countermeasures. All of us in the government and the public should act in good conscience and cooperate to solve the problem as a whole. Although the general public has no way to actively cooperate, they should relieve the panic from the passive side. Military police and civil servants should assist from the sidelines and should never use their positions to engage in favoritism and extortion. And powerful merchants must especially examine their conscience, use their capital, conduct legitimate trafficking, only take legal profits, and do not hoard and speculate for exorbitant profits. Everyone should take it as their responsibility to save the panic of people's food. If there are still illegal and exorbitant profit actions in this emergency measure, once verified, they should be spurned by the public and punished with wartime extreme punishment, so that those who have no heart and no conscience know what to quit!</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Effect of Emergency Rice and Grain Measures</h3>
<p>Recently, the National Government implemented emergency rice and grain measures, stopped the rice and grain purchasing work of the Rice Control Association and other agencies, and abolished the restrictions on the movement of rice and grain. This matter has been reported earlier. The above-mentioned policies have been well received in all aspects and are unanimously welcomed. The food insecurity in Shanghai and other places will be completely eliminated.</p>
<p>As has been repeatedly discussed before, the current high price of rice is half due to psychological conditions. In fact, rice and its sources may not have been hopeless. Therefore, if the psychological conditions can be eliminated, the price of rice will inevitably fall, and the phenomenon of panic and rush to purchase can also be reduced. Even if the amount of rice entering the country has not increased sharply, the price of rice can be suppressed to a certain extent. After the promulgation of the emergency rice and grain measures, due to rainfall and other conditions, the amount of rice entering Shanghai may not have increased sharply, but the price of rice has fallen considerably, which can prove the above-mentioned situation, and the future role of emergency measures can be imagined.</p>
<p>Emergency rice and grain measures, on the one hand, reduce the price of rice in Shanghai, and on the other hand, will also increase the price of rice in the place of origin to a certain extent. If the price of rice in Shanghai and the place of origin is balanced, the result will inevitably increase the intention of farmers to increase production, which is beyond doubt. However, although it is said that a balance can be achieved, there are actually limits to it. Such as the limit of rice merchants to raise funds, the high interest they pay, as well as the heavy taxes and miscellaneous taxes on rice channels, and the greedy profits of rice merchants, can all make the market prices in the place of origin and Shanghai still disparate. However, if the National Government's policies are appropriate, this problem can also be corrected considerably. After the emergency measures, the National Government's policies should of course be advanced in the above-mentioned aspects.</p>
<p>The implementation of emergency measures will promote the broad and free activities of general rice merchants. They will actively penetrate into the interior to purchase rice, and compare it with the market price in Shanghai. If it is cost-effective, they will collect and transport it to Shanghai. If it is not cost-effective, they will hoard it. The emergence of this result is expected. Past hoarding occurred in Shanghai or its vicinity, and future hoarding will occur in rice-producing areas, which must also be considered. Therefore, the National Government must take the entire Central China as the object and find ways to prevent hoarding. Otherwise, it will not be possible to eliminate unscrupulous merchants, and at the same time, it will be difficult to see the satisfactory results of emergency measures.</p>
<p>The result of emergency rice and grain measures is to give up general control over rice and grain. In essence, we hope that it is purely an emergency measure, that is, a temporary policy. This point has also been mentioned in the Shen Bao editorial, and it is emphasized that rice and grain control is necessary, but the content of the control must be suitable for China's national conditions and public sentiment, which is worth listening to. To put it bluntly, the past rice and grain control has made many mistakes. And today's rice and grain situation can also be regarded as the result of the accumulation of its mistakes. In short, the way of control must be changed first.</p>
<p>The general impression of the society on this emergency measure is extremely good. When the psychological conditions for the soaring price of rice are eliminated, it is necessary for the National Government to further seek active policies related to the following points. That is: immediately prohibit the illegal taxation of military police and civil servants, and thoroughly abolish the profiteering and hoarding of unscrupulous merchants. In order to make the effect of the emergency measures perfect, this must be resolutely realized. (Translated from the Mainland News on June 18)</p>

<h3>Sixteen Polish Leaders Tried in Moscow All Charged with Endangering Soviet Troops</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 19th Central News Agency Electric: According to Moscow telecommunications: In the brightly lit Moscow Commercial Association Auditorium, sixteen Polish leaders, led by Army Major General Okulicki, began to be tried. They were all charged with sabotage, intimidation of Soviet officers, using illegal radios for communication, and conducting various anti-Soviet propaganda campaigns. Army Major General Okulicki was also charged with espionage. However, only fifteen of the defendants attended the trial, one of whom, Bedak (a member of the Polish Socialist Party), was absent due to illness. Stipulowski, a key member of the executive department of the Peasant Party, began to vigorously defend himself during the interrogation, and Army Major General Okulicki also angrily retorted when writing his confession, saying, "I am innocent, but I am only considered guilty in the confession." After he finished speaking, he stood up suddenly and claimed that he wanted to call out his witnesses, and shouted out a series of military names. General Ulrich, the chief judge of the criminal court, asked urgently in view of this, "Where are these people?" He replied, "I don't know their exact whereabouts. They may be in the Soviet army's concentration camps or in prison." In addition to General Ulrich, there were also three army officers, the prosecutor was Afanasyev, who had served as the chief of the Soviet army's military law department, and seven defense lawyers for the defendants, led by Blot, also attended at the same time. At that time, the prosecutor read out the charges against the defendant, which stated that "All the defendants, including Okulicki, have admitted that they led the organization of a secret government in Poland, but the organization of this government was instructed by the London Polish government in exile. And Okulicki was instigated by the London Polish government in exile to disband the Polish National Army, and at the same time seized a general Polish military officer and seized a large number of East Weapons and radios, using this tool to scare the Soviet army, or to carry out various anti-official propaganda campaigns against the Soviet Union. Okulicki is actually the personal representative of General Gomorowski, the commander-in-chief of the former Polish secret government. According to Kao, he led the organization of the unfinished Warsaw government last year in an attempt to seize power, and at the same time, Okulicki also led a group of terrorists to kill 594 Soviet officers and injure 249 between July 28, 1944 and May 31, 1945, and he also admitted to organizing secret agencies in Estonia to carry out various harmful acts against the Soviet Union." At the same time, the charge also announced that "The Polish criminals who have been accused have indeed admitted their illegal actions, such as being instigated by the London Polish government in exile to lead the people to organize illegal secret agencies, and they have also admitted that they are responsible for all past illegal actions," etc.</p>

<h3>An Analysis of British and American Psychological Warfare: Using Radio Waves to Disrupt German Morale</h3>
<p>To understand this European war, one must know that what contributed to its end was not only the visible military and economic warfare, but also the vigorous propaganda and psychological warfare behind it. Kaiser Wilhelm II once said that Germany's defeat in the previous World War was due to British propaganda. Today, Nazi Germany, known for its propaganda warfare, has been taken advantage of by British and American propaganda. Isn't this a lesson for us who hope to complete the Greater East Asia War? Now, let's gather fragments of the complex situation within the European war.</p>
<p>British and American Propaganda Warfare</p>
<p>The British and Americans knew that the Nazi German national organization was very tight, leaving no room for espionage. Therefore, once the second front was successfully opened and the Red Army's offensive intensified, they immediately launched a white-hot radio wave war, attempting to awaken defeatist ideas within Germany and cause internal division. They intercepted German broadcasts in London, skillfully altered them, and retransmitted them on the same frequencies, so that German radio listeners could not tell whether it was German news or British broadcasts, and subtly carried out anti-German propaganda in between. They used the same method to disrupt shortwave radio providing news, so that German newspapers were often fooled into publishing inaccurate information. This shows how clever and insidious British and American propaganda methods were.</p>
<p>On January 18, Churchill gave a speech in the House of Commons, mentioning the unconditional surrender approach. Since then, the British and Americans have focused on this matter, repeatedly broadcasting it and constantly telling the Germans: "We are people who deeply believe in peace and freedom. We want to build peaceful and free institutions from today's chaos, hunger, and bloody disputes." They used all sorts of sweet words to imply that they were willing to negotiate an armistice. Therefore, despite the Soviet Union's fierce attacks, the German people considered the British and Americans, who loudly proclaimed adherence to international law, to still be Germany's friends, and that they would surely be able to unite to defeat the Soviet Union in the future. This optimistic view, towards the end of the war, became a firm hope for the German public, just like the appearance of new weapons. This tendency eventually affected the German government. The diplomatic errors committed by Himmler, Dönitz, etc., after Hitler's death—namely, seeking an armistice with the British and Americans and resisting the Soviets—stemmed from this reason.</p>
<p>Moreover, British and American psychological propaganda did not let up even until the very end. For example, when the Red Army began its general offensive against Berlin, Eisenhower's headquarters repeatedly broadcast in German and Russian: "Soviet soldiers, stop the atrocities and looting on the Eastern Front! That will only strengthen the German people's will to fight." It sounded as if the British and Americans were defending their homeland alongside the Germans, and were dissatisfied with the Red Army's tyrannical behavior. As a result, many Germans fell for their tricks and fled to areas occupied by British and American troops. This fact also proves that, in spirit, the German people were defeated by British and American propaganda warfare.</p>
<p>German New Weapons</p>
<p>The German people, until the very end, firmly believed that the appearance of new weapons would surely reverse the defeat. But did Germany actually have new weapons? According to the Qingxin News, Germany did have new weapons, and they would have appeared if they had been given a little more time.</p>
<p>The first item that can be mentioned is the radio wave emitter. This is a kind of death ray, and its range of emission can reach 1,200 meters on the ground and in the air. It is said that "airplanes are burned immediately when they encounter this ray, and tanks will explode internally." Germany is studying how to expand its sphere of influence so that its effective distance can reach 7,000 meters, but unfortunately various factories have been bombed and destroyed, so mass production could not be achieved in time.</p>
<p>The second type is high-speed aircraft. Because Germany lacked gasoline, it tried its best to invent an engine that did not use gasoline. It is said that "a jet fighter propelled by oxygen explosion has been successfully developed." Its speed is said to be faster than the speed of sound. It has been practically applied since the spring of this year, and is active east of Berlin, but mass production is also not possible. Generally speaking, it is a mother-child aircraft, that is, carrying a small aircraft on a large aircraft, releasing the small aircraft at an appropriate place, and using radio to control it to intercept enemy bombers or bomb enemy cities. However, this cannot sway the overall trend of the war.</p>
<p>In short, new weapons are not miracles. They are the result of a high level of science and constant effort. Even if their performance is very excellent, they cannot exert their power without mass production. This is the lesson that the European War gives us.</p>
<p>The Brutality of the British and American Armies</p>
<p>When the British and American armies fight, the black soldiers are used as their shields. The American commanding officers call the black soldiers mobile obstacles. No matter how many black soldiers are killed or wounded, they do not care about it any more than they care about the consumption of ammunition. This fully exposes the inhuman essence of the British and Americans, who are full of talk about humanitarianism and freedom. However, black soldiers are also bloodthirsty. As long as they are given a moment of pleasure, they are willing to endure the difficult life on the front lines. The British and Americans have seen through this weakness of the black people, and in order to drive them, they tacitly allow them to rob the German people, and even secretly order them to commit atrocities. However, the American authorities later executed the black soldiers who followed the orders according to military law, so those who do not know the inside story often think that the American army's military discipline is indeed strict and orderly. In fact, they are sacrificing black people to achieve their goals. As for the behavior of the American soldiers themselves, what is it like? Let's not talk about anything else. Just look at the behavior of the American soldiers when they were stationed in London, didn't they almost cause a serious diplomatic problem because of morality cases?</p>
<p>When British and American aircraft groups carry out air raids, they often scatter a large amount of raw sulfur in addition to incendiary bombs, causing poisonous gas to appear on the ground. They also pour a lot of gasoline when bombings cause fires, in order to completely burn the people on the ground to death. As a result, 40,000 people were sacrificed in the city of Treusden alone.

<h3>Municipal Ordinance: Protecting Grain Transport. Severe Punishment for Anyone Found Obstructing or Extorting</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government of this city received an order from the Executive Yuan, stating that the recent abnormal fluctuations in rice prices have greatly affected people's livelihoods. Therefore, emergency measures will be implemented, as follows: "The procurement work of the Rice Grain Control Committee and all other organizations will be temporarily suspended. The current restrictions on the movement of rice grain will be lifted. This measure is intended to open up sources so that, during the lean season, supplies can continue to flow, enriching the people. Upon receipt of this order, cooperation and promotion are essential to achieve practical results. Anyone who violates government policies, extorts, obstructs, or speculates and hoards will be severely punished. We sincerely hope that the military, police, officials, and the people will share this understanding, each fulfilling their duties to achieve the goal of stabilizing people's livelihoods. This order is issued for compliance and to instruct subordinates to comply." After receiving the order, the Municipal Government immediately instructed the relevant subordinate agencies, and the Municipal Security Command transferred the instructions to its subordinate teams, requiring them to provide effective protection to grain transport passing through their areas, allowing free passage without any obstruction. Any obstruction or extortion, once verified, will be severely punished. If there are unscrupulous merchants engaging in speculative hoarding, they should be reported at any time for legal action. Officials will be dispatched to conduct secret investigations along different routes to protect the people's food supply.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Invites Industry Leaders to Discuss Suppressing Prices. Hopes Industry Associations Will Take More Responsibility</h3>
<p>In light of the serious economic problems currently facing the city, the Municipal Government held a discussion meeting at 4:00 PM on June 19th, inviting over thirty people, including standing committee members of the Advisory Committee, directors of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and directors of various industry associations. Secretary-General Luo personally presided over the meeting and explained the significance of revising important commodity prices to adopt agreed-upon prices. He expressed the hope that various industry associations would take on the task of suppressing prices. After pricing is put on a reasonable path, the following points are crucial: The Grain Association must carefully calculate the prices applied for by its members. After prices are assessed, all members must strictly adhere to them to prevent the recurrence of black market activity. The associations are expected to impose sanctions on members who do not comply with the price limits. In addition, issues such as how to prevent hoarding after the removal of restrictions on rice sales and how to crack down on the practice of discounting banknotes along the way were discussed in detail by the attending committee members and industry representatives.</p>
<h3>Second Round of Affordable Coarse Grains Widely Available for Sale</h3>
<p>Recognizing that the rising prices of coarse grains are affecting people's livelihoods, the responsible persons of the Coarse Grain Industry Association of this city have decided to offer eight types of coarse grains, including adzuki beans and mung beans, at affordable prices. This plan has been approved and is being implemented on a trial basis by the Municipal Bureau of Economic Affairs, and has been on sale since the 17th of this month. It is learned that the responsible person of the Bureau of Economic Affairs has instructed the association to promptly notify all members to comply, mark the prices of the affordable coarse grains, and sell them widely. Anyone who does not follow the affordable pricing scheme should be reported to the nearest official for handling. The second round of the affordable price list has been submitted by the association and approved for publication by the Bureau. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Second Phase (June 20th to 22nd): Chongming adzuki beans: 1,500 yuan; Benniu adzuki beans: 9,500 yuan; Nanjing adzuki beans: 9,500 yuan; Benniu red beans: 16,500 yuan; Nanjing red beans: 9,500 yuan; Powdered mung beans: 9,500 yuan; Ordinary aged broad beans: 6,000 yuan; Corn: 8,000 yuan.

<h3>Economic Police Secretly Investigate Discounted Bank Drafts</h3>
<p>Severe punishment for disturbing financial order after verification</p>
<p>The Economic Police Corps of the Fourth Division of the Municipal Police Bureau, due to the current shortage of cash in the market, the Central Reserve Bank's drafts, the Bank Union Preparatory Committee's, the Money Industry Preparatory Treasury's drafts, and the discounting of bills of exchange from various banks and merchants are becoming more and more rampant. Some unscrupulous financial institutions, money changers, vendors, and illegal merchants are collecting cash and secretly exchanging drafts, charging a discount of about two jiao per yuan. Moreover, some illegal shops are refusing to accept drafts and are charging a discount when purchasing goods. Profiteering is rampant, affecting rising prices, and the people's livelihood is under severe threat. This is disrupting the financial order, which is very wrong. Therefore, in addition to ordering banks, money changers, and other financial institutions not to engage in this evil practice of high interest discounts, the police have been mobilized to conduct strict investigations in the markets and shops in all districts of the city. Whether it is a bank, money changer, vendor, or shop, if there is any discounting of drafts, it will be regarded as disrupting the financial order and violating the wartime economic regulations, and they will be arrested. The public is also encouraged to report any illegal merchants engaging in such activities to the Corps on the fourth floor of the Southern Building of the Fuzhou Road Police Bureau. The police will be dispatched to arrest them to eliminate this evil practice and protect the financial order.</p>
<p>It is learned that yesterday (the 19th), all small banks and merchants in the city stopped the exchange of drafts at a discount. At the same time, various banks and merchants have become more lenient in providing cash withdrawals to customers than before.</p>

<h3>Lao Zha Police Station Cracks Major Case: Soldiers Collude with Gangsters to Rob Fabric Factory</h3>
<p>The Lao Zha Police Branch previously arrested suspects in a military robbery of a hotel on April 5th of this year. After investigation by the Security Command, the suspects were found guilty and executed according to law. On the 11th of this month, soldiers colluded with gangsters to rob the Xin Guang Fabric Factory of registered cotton fabrics worth tens of millions of yuan. Xu, the head of the branch, and Song Bingzheng, the director of the third section, summoned all judicial personnel, including plainclothes officer Song Shaomei, to discuss countermeasures in detail. Director Song instructed the course of action, and Officer Song, along with other officers, solved the case after several days of careful investigation. The suspects and stolen goods were arrested and recovered. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Unlawful Soldiers Rob Fabric</p>
<p>On the morning of the 11th of this month, at around 5:00 AM, two soldiers and five men in plain clothes,  from the Business Coordination Association, moved 633 registered multicolored cotton fabrics and 120 bales of cotton yarn onto a pre-arranged truck. Because the personnel intimidated and beat anyone, and did not allow anyone to go outside to report the matter, Jiang Zuqin, an apprentice at Da Long Fabric Store inside, became suspicious. He secretly went outside and witnessed a truck loaded with yarn and cloth speeding away. Afterwards, the factory owner Ma Yaoting reported the facts to the Lao Zha Branch. Xu, the head of the branch, and Song Bingzheng, the director of the third section, gathered all officers on duty, including plainclothes officer Song Shaomei, to discuss the case. Based on the truck's color sample provided by Jiang, they investigated at various truck companies and the Traffic Section of the General Bureau. They found that the truck belonged to Yi You Truck Company at 267 Anhui Road, number  "27169", driven by driver Xia Jingen. They summoned Xia to the bureau for investigation.</p>
<p>Investigating All Night, Suspects Arrested</p>
<p>Xia claimed that at around 4:00 AM that morning, six or seven soldiers ordered him to drive the truck to 756 Jiujiang Road to load fabric, then drive to Shunchang Road to park. After the fabric was transferred to handcarts, it was moved away. Director Song immediately ordered officers to investigate handcarts at various locations on Shunchang Road based on  Xia's statement. As a result, the handcart driver Gu Lao San, who had transported the fabric, was arrested and brought to the bureau. He stated: "The fabric was moved to a house at 120 Ximen Road." That night, they went to the aforementioned location and arrested the suspect Zhang Gendi and recovered part of the stolen goods. The case began to take shape. Based on Zhang's statement,  it was the work of demobilized soldiers. They notified the commander of the soldiers' service unit to detain the unlawful soldiers while continuing the investigation. They arrested the director Ma Weixiang at the China Operations Company at 334 Nanjing Road. Based on Ma's statement, they arrested another principal offender, Li Yu, and Shi Shichun and Tang Yaoxing at the Grand China Hotel. Based on the confessions of the suspects, most of the stolen goods were recovered one after another. More than twenty people were involved in receiving the stolen goods, and they will be investigated and prosecuted by the District Prosecutor's Office.</p>
<p>Huge Fraud Case Worth 200 Million Yuan</p>
<p>On the 6th of this month, Wang Zhuliang and other businessmen reported to the third section of the branch that Hong Kang Securities, located in the Securities Building at 426 Hankou Road, was opened by partners Pan Hongliang and Jiang Shanhua, who engaged in stock trading on behalf of customers. Wang and fifteen others sold stocks and entrusted the company to buy stocks with mortgaged gold, totaling 200 million yuan. On June 6th, the company stopped operating, and Pan and Jiang disappeared. It was clearly a case of fraudulent acquisition of property. Plainclothes officer Feng Xiushan, who was on duty, took charge of the case. After investigating, they discovered that Pan and Jiang were hiding in Room 505 of the Jinmen Hotel. They went to the address, but Pan and Jiang had already fled upon hearing the news. They only arrested the accountant Tang Yu and brought him to the bureau for investigation. Because Tang had brought the account books to his residence, he was suspected of being an accomplice in the fraud and was detained for investigation. They are currently pursuing Jiang and Pan to bring them to justice.</p>
<h3>Home Tutor Training Class to Hold Entrance Exam Today</h3>
<p>Engaging Home Tutors, Please Come to Discuss</p>
<p>The newspaper's Compulsory Education Committee has established a "Home Tutor Training Class" to meet social needs. It has been observed that the academic performance of children from wealthy families in Shanghai is often substandard and they even fail to advance to the next grade. During summer vacation, parents should find ways to help their children catch up on their studies. Otherwise, a long summer spent playing all day will inevitably lead to further neglect. Therefore, summer tutoring is essential. However, home tutoring is not easy to do. Therefore, the committee has recruited qualified primary school teachers and provided them with short-term training in preparation for employment by families. More than seventy people have applied to the committee in recent days, mostly women. The entrance exam will be held today (20th) at 4:30 PM at the Qunhua Primary School on West Changxing Road. Those who pass will begin training the following day.</p>
