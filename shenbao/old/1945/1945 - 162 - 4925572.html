<h3>錫澄虞萬盲從　先天道內幕（二）</h3>
<p>— 余彧</p>
<p>組織內幕</p>
<p>由於農民歷年的積悶，一但有所寄託，雖屬送信，也極崇信，因之聲勢日益擴大。其勢力範圍，也逐漸裹延，起初是只在四區安頓，香堂設在朱家里，也可以說是南方先天過的發源地，後來伸展至三區張涇橋，以穢人力量而定·會員會費，起初每人二百元，後加至二千五百元，所收之款，交徐粹初保管處理，也無報銷，以信用爲憑。因爲農民智識幼稚，平時缺乏訓練。對先天道的信準，又如火如荼，故分會林立，只要有數十人，設一個壇，便可成一個分會，並不向總會連絡，或申請成立，因此缺乏國結。他們的結合，是以一村爲　位，一有事故，便鳴鑼兩下爲號，各村聽到　聲，立刻同時響應，向出事地點迅速集合，拿刀的拿刀，拿槍的拿槍，形形色色，不分男女，有事集合，無事烏散。</p>
<p>先天道之組織，固然毫無秩序，而它釣成長，亦是完全盲從，然而他們的宗旨，却都是一樣，他們的宗旨，便是保義家鄉。因此，他們認爲凡與之作對的，便是他們的敵人，他們爲着保護家鄉起見，只有集結與對方一拚，他們的對象是刦奪他們的遊匪，和　故敲詐的軍警惡吏。他們覺得在此亂世，政府的力量，旣不能保護，只有靠神的力量，和自己的力量來保護。因爲他們覺得只有神是大公無私的，只有神權和自己的奮　，才能解除本身的痛苦。先天道在今日所以能够這樣迅速推廣，也許是建立在這一點上。</p>
<p>成功易失敗亦易</p>
<p>一個團體，如果沒有統盤籌劃，和嚴肅的紀律，自然很容易變質的，先天道本來是一個沒有組織的烏合之衃，而他們却有着一窩風的力量，自然會給一般狡點者覬覦利用，由秘密而至公開後，便逐漸插進了許多居心不良的投機份子，大都是遊匪，地痞，惡棍，及企圖報復私仇者之流，他們的目的也不一致，遊匪是企圖取得他們的勢力，增加自身的力量。地痞包括兩種，一種投機取巧，藉收漁利，一種是平時被農民懷恨的，深恐爲農民所害，乃表示懺悔，以便保留生命。惡棍均爲一般游手好閒之徒，專喜興風作浪，最好小事化大事，藉此可以從中弄權取利。</p>
<p>至於爲報復私仇者，則藉着先天道的勢力，爲私仇報復。其初會員之間，皺講義氣，會員中如有困難，爭相臂助。聽設在一二月前，有夫妻二口，在上海生活困難，疏散回鄉，經過檢問所，遭檢查員扣住，指稱所帶之物，是違禁品，應予扣押，結果男的旣受侮辱，携物又被强取，經此刺激，悶然不業，久之積　成病以至死亡·共妻大爲哀慟，懷恨銜骨，當時聽說鄉間盛行「先天道」，便轉嚴加八。某日，她披頭散髪，說是丈夫的幽靈默告他，要他復仇，衃農民信以爲眞，且大家對於鄉間的檢問所人負，平時受盡剝削，莫不銜恨，於是一唱百和，衃怒難犯，就一窩蜂奔向檢閱所，以女人爲首，推出其殺夫之仇，不由分說，刀槍齊動，死於衆怒之下。</p>
<p>先天道經此動亂，儘管通規怎樣「不准貧非義之財，不准勾結匪類。」但作惡者難保在晴中被壞規則，因之份子一複雜，風耙亦日形敗壞，久乏，雖領袖也無力量控制，命令等於廢紙。現在先天道的份子，大槪可以分威下列五種：純正農民佔百分之五十，遊匪及腐化份子佔百分之十，地痞無賴佔百分之二十，冀圖復仇者佔百分之十，好奇者及無業遊民佔百分之十。在一個團體中有這樣五種不同思想，不同目的的份子，試問風紀如何不致敗壞，先天道如此容易成立，也就是如此容易失敗的主因。（未完待續）</p>

<h3>日本特攻政治的出發　日本第八十七次臨時議會的意義</h3>
<p>太平洋的戰局已逐漸接近決戰的階段，冲繩島的戰况正在邀擊的能勢之下繼續苦鬥，敵美對於日本本土的侵寇仍在不斷窺探之中，在這種形勢嚴重的現狀下，日本第八十七次臨時議會在八日召開，并決定九，十日繼續開會。其意義之重大，不僅日本全國國民必爲之振奮。即我國國民亦必須加以認識注意。</p>
<p>日本鈴木首相的施政演說，率直坦白，自就任時發表的談話以及屢次對國民的廣播，都一貫流露着「鞠躬盡瘁」的忠君愛國的精神。鈴木首相在就任談話中說：「目前挽回狂瀾之大任，唯一億同胞是賴」；在拜受大命的廣播中又說：「頑敵與本土之距離日近一日，而挽救危急之道，除激揚國民之敵愾心，以及集中國家總力，萬衃一心外，別無他途」；今日更申前義，認爲國內情形雖省種種困難，而「全體國民倘能奮發作戰，以決死之努力，守各人之職位，余確信必能克服困難，完成戰爭之目的。』鈴木首相的意志比以前更加堅決，期望更加殷切。而在美機狂炸盲炸下的日本國民更必能以鈴木首相的意志爲意志，副鈴木首相之所期待，團給一起，共同負起解救危局的重任的。</p>
<p>我們在鈴木首相的演說中，有幾點是不能不深切認識注意的，現在分析如下：</p>
<p>第一：鈴木首相對於大東亞戰爭的本質一再闡明，日本究戰之動機，第一爲美英兩國之橫暴態度及非分野望而戰，第二日本爲自存自立而戰，第三爲東亞全體之安全而戰。要而言之，日本之宣戰乃由正義而出發。其次，鈴木首相又鄭重聲明日本皇室建國的木願在『酷愛和平，希求人類福祉」，「使萬邦各得其所，四海同胞瞭解人類之道義，推進文化」之處，更可知日本之究戰原爲不得已而採此舉措的。今日的局勢雖然非常嚴重，可是要推斷戰爭的將來，非從這一點出發不可，就是已經耳熟能詳，亦不能不朮新認識。</p>
<p>第二：關於日本的作戰熊度，鈴木首相在演說中聲明了兩次，旣曰：「聞敵人今要求我人無條件投降，照此爲破壞我國體，滅亡我民族，我人對之，惟有作戰到底」，又日：「靜察敵國國內情勢之動向，觀乎國際情勢之歸趨，莫不使人痛感我人惟有作戰到底，捨此之外，無地途可循。』日本的作戰的趨向非常明顯，一切敵性謠傳將不攻自破。</p>
<p>第三：鈴本首相對於大東亞及世界秩序之禮本原則。聲明「確定不威脅，不侵略之安全保障之途」，此辭句之表現實非常有力。其次即聲明；「對於中華民國統一救國之機運實表支持』，我人對此更不能不加以注意。我國在四月中各地曾開「戰時民衃代表大會」，提出統一救國之主張，此次得鈴木首相呼應支持，統一救國運動必須促使實現。</p>
<p>第四：日本本土今日已成鐵壁的要塞化，日本本土的決戰是今日當前唯一的要着，熟悉戰略的鈴木首相常然深知條件的有利，所以說：「倘若本土化爲戰塲，則地利人和，我均勝敵萬倍，」米內海相於戰况報告中所謂：「戰爭之勝敗，決於最後之五分鐘，」其深意也在此。日本的本土決戰已成爲達到戰爭目的的必然的重要戰略，所以此次臨時議會的使命便在如何完成本土決戰的態勢。</p>
<p>此次臨時議會的重大意義旣如鈴本首相的演說所昭示，討論的目標從議題來推測，可以分做以下兩點：</p>
<p>第一，決戰政治力量的集中　此次最受注目的「戰時緊急措置法案」，其內容雖不以憲法三十一條「非常大權」爲根據，而實際使議會對於政府具有全權委任之性質。這是政府決戰政治實施的先兆，也是日本政治由多元而一元的緊急處置。</p>
<p>第二，決戰軍事力量的普遍　日本政府向臨時議會提出的六項法案中有二項是關於國民義勇軍的。國民義勇軍的組織不但是日本政府的希望，也是日本國民的希望。這次義勇兵役的法案討論的意義，不僅在於國民義勇軍的運動得到法律的基礎。并且是日本一億同胞共同蹶起的動員令。</p>
<p>總之，日本本土全體，無論地的要紮，無論物的要素，無論人的要素，都必須配備在決戰的體制中。日本的强力的政治力必須排除萬難負起這重大的任務。日本的政治，將無分議會，無分政府，而以一億特攻的精神來實施特攻的政治。日本這次臨時議會的空前的意義，便是日本特攻政治的出發。</p>
<h3>日實施决戰行政　設立地方總監部　由西尾大將軍等分任總監</h3>
<p>東京十日中央社電　日政府爲實施決戰地方行政，頃決定於全國一道七地方之行政協議會所在地，各設地方總監部，而由現任地方行政協議會長任地方總監，十日上午，各總監已於鈴木首相侍立之下，舉行親任式，茲誌各總盡姓名如下：北海道總監熊谷　一，東北地方總監丸山鶴去，關東信越地方總監兼東京都長官陸軍大將西尾壽造，東海北陸地方總監小　忠良，近幾地方總監安井英二，中國地方總監大塚惟精，四國地方總監木村正義，九州地方總監戶塚九一郎。</p>
<p>東京十日中央社電　今春一月，小磯首相爲謀防衛與行政之吻合，以及運營施策之迅速化，採取措置，加强協戰會長與軍司令官及鎭守府司令長官間之聯緊。日政府茲爲强化地方行政之綜合運營，解散地方行政協議會，另創以協議會區域爲單位之地方總監府制度，作爲强力行政機關，担任統轄監督各管內地方行政，以確立各地方自立自戰態勢。地方總監府，根據官制規定，爲純粹之行政官廳，對各管內地方廳以及各特別地方廳，均有指揮監督權，至此，日本內政運營機構，分成政府，地方總監府及地方廳三階級，依照協議會區域，計設八處地方總監府。地方總監爲親任官，在其下配置地方副總監六名，爲敕任官，尤有一點更值注目，即過去協議會長兼任該地府縣知事，但今後地方總監與知事分別任命，惟四國地方及北海道地方，因地域上關係，仍予兼任。</p>
<h3>托里埃斯特問題　三國簽訂協定　南國西北分界錢劃定</h3>
<p>瑞典京城十日中央社電　據此間昨夜接獲消息。關於佔領及臨時管理托里埃斯特與斯羅文尼克沿海地區之英美南三國政府協定，已於昨日在貝爾格勒　簽訂以後，此項協定即爲南斯拉夫軍部代表及聯合國方面軍部代表，於將來訂立其他必要協定時之基本原則。據倫敦官方宣稱，自托里埃斯特南部地區北經戈里齊亞，以迄於奧地利邊境之維拉哈（即卡林西亞），巳劃爲聯合國與南斯拉夫之分界綫，在此分界錢之西部，整個文尼齊亞。戈里亞將歸爲聯合國駐地中海軍最高司令亞歷山大將軍屬下之統轄區，在該分界綫之東部，將全歸於南國政府統治之，同時南國軍隊將以一小部（約二千名）留駐於該分界綫之西部，以組成一受亞歷山大總司令直接統轄之共同管理機關</p>
<h3>希特勒　生死未卜</h3>
<p>里斯本十日中央社電　銀路透社特派訪員化貝談稱：巨哥夫將軍今日向聯合國新聞記者發表謂，「在柏林城陷落之前兩日，希特勒元首曾與一電影女明星勃朗舉行結婚禮」。</p>
<p>瑞典京城十日中央社電　據英國駐莫斯科訪員談稱：蘇聯駐柏林衛戍軍總指揮布薩林陸軍中校，於昨日透露渠私人之意見，略謂希特勒元首尙未死亡，後必　置於歐洲某地，或與西班牙領袖弗朗哥將軍同居一處，亦未可知。我等雖屢次發現有酷似希特勒元首之屍體，然我等尙未敢斷言彼一定死亡。同時巨哥夫將軍亦曾聲稱，希特勒元首之與勃朗女明星結婚已爲事實，蓋德參謀總部陷入蘇軍手中時，查出有一部份副官之日計冊中，截有關於希特勒結婚之記事。</p>

<h3>中儲行今日起　發行五千元券　適應市面現鈔需要</h3>
<p>最近一月以來，物價念劇騰漲，通貨籌碼需要益繁，且届新農作物即將次第登塲，春　上市，各絲綢廠商均紛紛向產區收買春　，需要現鈔殷切，市面現鈔益盛缺少。中央儲備銀行爲適應現實需要，據銀錢兩業要求，特呈准財政部，提經最高國防會議通過，修正中儲銀行法，增發五千元券及一萬元券兩種，定於今（十一）日起先行發行三十四年版五千元券。中儲銀行通告云：</p>

<p>滬市金融與工商各業市况，最近一週繼續激變，趨勢益形險惡，因流言浮動，人心志忑不定，投機市僧，活躍市塲，擁資者居奇操縱，炲赤暗市劇漲微跌，迭創新高峯，大戶收進，扳不吐售，雖有金證券第三期發行，但以掛牌增高，暗市高峯，難以遏止，中途僅週三稍見回平，不久又復上升，較前跳起三十大關。紋銀亦績見高升，聯鈔日票步漲，尚稱穩健，敵性通貨當局禁止雖嚴，暗中買賣仍難肅淸，價漲殊烈，惟跌落亦大。華股繼漲，週三因銀根趨緊，一度普遍跌停板，週四下午復起漲風，週五漲勢更厲，週六上午半日市面，漲後旋跌，人心堅挺，買風仍熾，惟其中美亞永安公司及紗廠三熱門股，趨勢疲軟，蓋以拉抬過高，起伏危險性甚大，買戶胃口較淡，中小型股。工商方面，因炲赤股市上漲，且生產原料不易獲得，持貨者不願脫手，加以資產家搜購囤積，釀成一片漲價聲。糧食一週內，漲高十數萬元之鉅，雜糧·油·糖。燃料·煤炭·柴·相繼上漲八成至一倍。日用品中之肥皂，火柴，棉織中之紗布，綢緞，呢絨，市價已超過一倍以上。蔬菜市價漲升，漫無標準，各公司商號門售物品標價，一日數變，較物價評議委員會核定門售限價，已超過三倍至四倍。但未聞當局有何處置，而物價評議委員會對於最近評議物價，迄未見公佈實施，市民認爲如再不採取迅速評議物價，雷厲執行新限價，社會一般平民生計，將不堪設想，影響民生治安，前途實堪憂慮。</p>

<h3>保甲與疏散</h3>
<p>— 金雄白</p>
<p>本市市區保甲宣傳委員會委員平報社長金雄自氏，於十日下午七時在上海電台廣播詞：目從政府實行保甲制度以來，上海的治安與防犯，　因此有了顯著的進步。保甲在平時，旣可以補助軍警力量的不足，確保家室的安寗，一旦有事，可以守望相助，減少不必要的危害，尤其在戰時，如空襲火患等等，更其需要保甲的齊心一致，羣策羣力。過去我們看到一個莫大的缺點，便是認爲保甲的服役，僅僅是一種政府功令，認爲是市民的義務，一切保甲上應做的事都出之數衍塞責的態度，這眞是十二分遺憾的事。因爲家是我們的家，地方是我們共同所有的地方，集合各個人所盡很少的義務，使每一家和整個的地方安如磐石，所收的效果，與所得的福利，還是我們自己的，所以，我們應當共同以最大的努力，使保甲組織嚴密起來，力量發揮出來。如目前敷衍塞責的狀態，徒然消費了人力物力，這種僅是形式的保甲，如逢着有事故發生，便要手忙腳亂，束手待斃了，結果苦還是我們自己吃的，所以我首先籲請全體市民對保甲的注意。</p>
<p>減少損失保存國力</p>
<p>講到疏散問題種種事實上的不能走的很多，上海市民的通病，自已沒有堅定的意旨，都看着人家怎麼辦，自已也跟着怎麼辦，如此因循下去，一旦要走會走不成了，各位，何苦把一家的生命這樣的蹉跎下去！</p>
<p>我們知道在空製的威脅之下疏散人口，便是減少損害，也就是保存國力，在人口密集的大　市，一旦遇到了空襲，死傷終不能免，我們雖然不能完全把空襲的威脅解除，但我們總得想法把損害減低到最小的限度。人力是戰時唯一的懷賽，我們必須寶貴人力，珍重人力，因此就不能不顧到人力可能遭到的危險而竭力的設法，消除其危險，或者減少其危險，所以疏散工作，在目前的上海眞是一件最重要而必須實行的事情。</p>
<p>其次，目前上海民食問題的嚴重，已成無可諱言的事實，米價的激劇增漲，使升斗小民將無法解決其「吃的問題」，這一次米價的上漲，較過去幾次有些不同，因爲各地的米價都在逐步的上漲，即使素稱產米之區，也有了同樣的情形，所以上海米價的增漲，恐怕短時期內不易平復。再則，隨着米價的上漲，雜糧的市價，也在逐步的昂　。這樣，民食問題的恐慌，更日形嚴重了，今日的市民正應該自動的疏傷，鄕下有家的歸家，無家的則就其親友，鄉下米價雖責，總比上海爲低，食糧的供應，總比上海爲易，而且空襲的危機，也比上海好得多，市民又何樂而不疏散呢？</p>
<p>局和民間的領袖早經設立了一個人口疏散委員會，現定十一日起，實行第一次的疏散，疏散專輸將開蘇州，市民要去的可到各區辦事處去登記，似使　豫不決，趔起不前，坐失了疏散的機會，將來或者遭到了損害。那是懊悔也來不及了。</p>
<p>現在，已不是理論的階段，而是澈底實行的時候了，要實行這一重要的工作，必須是全體市民，羣起協力，尤其是保甲方面，更要負起極大的</p>
<p>利用保甲促進疏散</p>
<p>上海保甲的組織雖然只有短短的歷史，可是大體已經具有基礎，怎樣利用保甲機構去促進疏散運動的實踐，這是目前保甲方面一大課題。我們知道：民衆智識的幼稚，認識的淺薄，判斷的不足等等，因而釀成不問事情之重要與否，大多數民衃只是以一種淡漠的態度相視的習慣，疏散工作之未能澈底展開，這也是原因之一。今後保甲人員，必須以誠懇的熊度，向各戶去詳細價釋疏散的必要，同時問明其家庭狀况·職業環境，如無留滬必要的人們，一律勸導其即日統散，如有困難問題，並須代爲解決，對於國家，對於人民，都有很大的裨益，這纔具完成了疏散的使命，達到了疏散的目的。</p>
<p>諸位，戰事已到了決戰的階段，戰事的危害與糧食的恐慌，爲不可避免的事實，鄉村一定比都市好，上海人口的密集，假如遇到大空襲，其結果將不堪設想。在糧食方面現在已到靑黃不接的時候，而且運輸又特別困難，情形一天一天嚴重下去，治安方面也很可慮，現在不是一動不如一靜的時候了，各位不要因爲貪圖上海生活的舒適，以身家性命作兒戲，還是趕快疏散，趁早疏散吧！</p>

<h3>The Speakers of the Japanese House of Peers and House of Representatives Paid Respects at the Imperial Palace Yesterday, Both Houses Held Plenary Sessions Separately</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Speakers of the Japanese House of Peers and House of Representatives, Tokugawa and Shimada respectively, visited the Imperial Palace at 10:30 AM on the 10th to pay respects to His Majesty the Emperor. They presented the Imperial Rescript and a response. His Majesty the Emperor was deeply appreciative and bestowed another gracious Imperial Rescript, commending the respect of both Houses.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The House of Peers held a plenary session at 10:25 AM on the 10th. First, Vice-Speaker Sakai reported that Speaker Tokugawa had carefully expressed concern for the war damage to the Imperial Palace and offered greetings. Afterward, the government's proposed draft of the "Court Organization Law Wartime Special Exceptions Amendment Law" and another item were immediately placed on the agenda and passed unanimously as reported by the committee chairman. Subsequently, Speaker Tokugawa reported that when he presented the Imperial Rescript and Response at the Imperial Palace today, he was again granted a gracious Imperial Rescript. The entire assembly stood in solemn attention to listen to the Imperial Rescript. At 11:35 AM, a recess was taken.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese House of Representatives held a plenary session at 1:18 PM. Speaker Shimada reported on the presentation of the Imperial Rescript and Response and the memorial regarding war damage, and solemnly read the Emperor's second gracious Imperial Rescript. The entire assembly stood in solemn attention to listen. The agenda was then changed to urgently discuss the "Court Organization Law Wartime Special Exceptions Amendment Law" and its attachments, which had been submitted by the government and forwarded by the House of Peers. Minister of Justice Matsusaka explained the reasons for the proposal, which was then referred to a committee for deliberation. The session recessed at 1:30 PM.</p>
<h3>The Ministers of the Army and Navy Report on the War Situation</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - At yesterday's special session of the Diet, Army Minister Anami reported on the war situation, with the following main points: Regarding the situation in Okinawa, seven weeks have passed since enemy forces landed on the main island. During this time, our forces, fighting against numerically superior enemies, have inflicted heavy damage. In late May, our forces withdrew from the Shuri and Naha areas to reorganize the battle lines in the rear. In Burma and the Philippines, our forces are fighting fiercely against superior enemy forces, but morale is extremely high, and they continue to engage the enemy. American-style Chongqing troops from North Burma have been transferred to Kunming and the Yangtze River area. The enemy is also attempting to land and conduct operations from the Pacific side, and we have made thorough preparations. Although the soldiers and officers on each front continue to fight bravely, we must frankly admit that the entire East Asian war situation is currently in a difficult state. We are now standing at an unprecedented national crisis. Now is an excellent opportunity to proclaim to China and foreign nations the true essence of our glorious national polity. Our army and navy are working together as one, and under the single operational concept, we are confident that we will be able to destroy the enemy. We will repay the assistance and trust of our compatriots in the army with the fact of resounding victory and live up to the expectations of the people.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Navy Minister Yonai reported on the war situation at yesterday's special session of the Diet, with the following main points: Frankly speaking, the situation in Okinawa is very unfavorable to us. Although we are currently exerting all our efforts under the cooperation of the army and navy to destroy the enemy forces, we have not yet been able to destroy all of the enemy's warships and mobile units to gain air supremacy, and our ground forces are being suppressed, which is extremely regrettable. However, we have also inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy during this time. The war results that have now been confirmed have reached a considerable amount. As of now, the number of enemy ships that have been bombed and sunk by our forces, compared with the American naval power unique to the Okinawa campaign at the time of its start, accounts for one-half of aircraft carriers and cruisers, and one-fifth of special aircraft carriers and battleships. In addition, there are still many ships of unidentified types. From various points of view, the enemy's operations are actually more difficult than ours. The outcome of the war must be decided in the final five minutes. Therefore, no matter what difficulties we encounter in the future, the Imperial Navy will fight to the end with an indomitable spirit to achieve the objectives of the holy war.</p>
<p>Situation of the House of Representatives Meeting the Day Before Yesterday</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - At the plenary session of the House of Representatives on the 9th, after deciding on the answer to the Imperial Rescript, the entire assembly stood and passed the resolution to present a memorial regarding the previous disaster in the Imperial Palace, and then entered into general reports. In the afternoon, Prime Minister Suzuki delivered a policy speech, followed by Army Minister Anami and Navy Minister Yonai, who gave separate reports on the war situation. The entire assembly then unanimously passed a resolution of gratitude and condolence to the army and navy officers and soldiers, and after offering a silent prayer for the fallen soldiers, the army and navy ministers delivered their thanks. Then, it was the time for representative questioning. Mr. Masataka Ota of the Japan Political Association raised questions regarding the national guidance policy for the war situation, the responsibility for guiding the war situation, and the strengthening of coordination among military officers, and expressed the hope that war disaster countermeasures and price countermeasures would be implemented promptly. Prime Minister Suzuki replied: Regarding the national guidance policy, in order to deal with the decisive battle on the mainland with the unity of the whole country, we plan to prepare and establish a posture, boost the national will to fight, and ensure food and weapons, with the organization of national volunteers as the key points, and give play to its function. Regarding the responsibility for the war, the government and the Supreme Command are cooperating closely, but as the war situation is gradually becoming serious, the close cooperation between state affairs and command should be further enhanced in order to carry out the war. Regarding the adjustment and strengthening of policies between government and civilians, it is gradually being implemented. Regarding the prompt implementation of government policies, I deeply agree. After the Prime Minister finished answering, Minister of the Navy Yonai and Minister of Health Okada provided supplementary explanations. Following the addition of the agenda, four items, including the Wartime Emergency Measures Bill, were submitted in turn. The government side explained the reasons for the proposals and referred them to a committee. The meeting adjourned at 4:25 PM.</p>
<p>Japanese Combat Volunteer Corps Will Be Supplied with Firearms at Any Time</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Director of the Military Affairs Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of the Army, Nasu, stated on the 9th during the Diet’s volunteer military service bill committee, in response to questions, a policy to provide combat volunteers with hand grenades and other weapons. Regarding the status and rank of volunteer corps members when they are transferred to combat units, he elaborated as follows: The actual tasks of the volunteer corps are mainly rear service and other communication and information during combat. However, in urgent situations, combat members must also engage in guerrilla warfare or self-defense combat and, to the extent possible, under the consideration of local troops or divisions, be given hand grenades or other firearms. Second, regarding status and rank, when volunteer corps members are transferred to combat units, the status and rank of the volunteer corps will still apply.</p>
<p>Wartime Emergency Measures Bill</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - In order to adapt to the current difficult situation, the Japanese government has proposed a Wartime Emergency Measures Bill in this Diet session. According to this bill, the Japanese government has specially formulated a legislative bill based on wartime law in order to implement emergency measures and deal with difficult situations. Therefore, its purpose is to take any emergency measures when implementing various measures to enhance combat power, to enhance combat power, and not to be bound by any existing laws. This is what is called the "Parliamentary Bill of Complete Delegation of Authority." In short, this bill has the same effect as invoking Article 31 of the Constitution, the "Emergency Great Power." The full text of the bill has five articles. As for the following matters: Maintaining and enhancing military production, Ensuring food and other daily necessities, Maintaining and enhancing transportation and communication, Strengthening defense and maintaining order, Amending tax rates, Post-war measures for war damage, Other matters necessary for the concentrated exertion of combat power, will be stipulated by imperial ordinance.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Launch Special Attacks, Assault Enemy Warships, Naval Infantry Charge at Night</h3>
<p>Southern West Islands Base, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - A Japanese torpedo squadron discovered traces of enemy battleships and cruisers in the sea area around Okinawa Island on the 9th and launched a daring attack. Other Japanese air units also attacked three large enemy ships and three ships of unknown types in the same area with large direct-hit bombs, causing large fires. Also, on the morning of the 9th, they attacked the enemy airfield on Ie Island, causing continuous explosions in several places, with flames soaring into the sky, visible from afar. From the night of the 9th to the 10th, the Japanese air force continued to repeatedly attack the enemy positions.</p>
<p>Forward Aviation Base, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - It has now been determined that the Japanese Army Special Attack Unit had previously carried out a close-quarters assault on enemy warships around Okinawa, with the entire aircraft crashing into one enemy battleship, one large transport ship, and one ship of unknown type. From the night of the 8th to the morning of the 9th, special attacks were again launched against the enemy.</p>
<p>Southwestern Islands Base, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - For four days in early June, Japanese naval infantry used artillery and explosives to break into enemy positions in the Ozato area, killing and wounding 1,340 enemies and destroying and burning approximately 19 enemy tanks and other vehicles.

<p>All Okinawa Island Residents Help in the War</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Since the enemy landed on Okinawa Island in early April, all the residents of the island have been assisting the military in fighting the enemy, and the spirit of loyalty and patriotism of the Japanese people has been fully demonstrated. The young men of the island go without saying, even women and children all place the country and the home above all else, and life and death as secondary. There are often elementary school students carrying explosives and rushing into enemy positions, causing the enemy to marvel in surprise. Governor of Okinawa Prefecture Shimada and other local officials are currently leading civil and military volunteer corps, urging the army to direct operations on the front lines. On the 14th of last month, when the conference of local leaders was held in Tokyo, a telegram was sent in the name of the conference to encourage Governor Shimada. The governor replied: "I swear to fight to the death on the battlefield and not fail your expectations." By the end of last month, communication between Okinawa and Tokyo had become difficult, but every effort was made to maintain contact. Recently, the Governor's report on the war situation and political affairs has reached the Japanese government. The document details the current situation of the islanders' heroic resistance. Practical measures have been prepared regarding actions after the enemy landing. As for the governor himself, there is not a word of mention, because the governor only knows loyalty and patriotism and has long put his personal affairs out of his mind. In addition, Okinawa's only newspaper, the "Okinawa Shinpo," is still being published as usual, contributing greatly to the war effort.</p>

<h3>The Inner Workings of the Xicheng Yuman Blindly Followed Innate Taoism (2)</h3>
<p>— Yu Yu</p>
<p>Organizational Insider</p>
<p>Due to the accumulated resentment of farmers over the years, once there is something to rely on, even if it is a belief, they are extremely trusting, so the momentum is expanding day by day. Its sphere of influence is also gradually widening. At first, it was only settled in the Fourth District, and the incense hall was set up in Zhujiali, which can also be said to be the birthplace of Southern Innate Taoism. Later, it was extended to Zhangjing Bridge in the Third District, which was determined by the power of the masses. The membership fee was initially 200 yuan per person, and later increased to 2,500 yuan. The money collected was handed over to Xu Cuichu for safekeeping and processing, and there was no reimbursement, relying on credit. Because farmers' knowledge is naive and they lack training on weekdays, their belief in Innate Taoism is like a raging fire, so branch halls are everywhere. As long as there are dozens of people, setting up an altar can form a branch hall without contacting the general hall or applying for establishment, so there is a lack of national unity. Their combination is based on a village as a unit. If there is an accident, they will sound the gong twice as a signal. When each village hears the gong sound, they will respond immediately and gather quickly to the place where the accident occurred, those with knives taking knives, those with guns taking guns, in various forms, regardless of men or women. They gather when something happens, and disperse when nothing happens.</p>
<p>Although the organization of Innate Taoism is completely disorganized, and its growth is also completely blind, their goals are all the same. Their goal is to protect the righteousness of their hometown. Therefore, they believe that anyone who opposes them is their enemy. In order to protect their hometown, they can only gather together and fight the other side. Their targets are bandits who rob them and corrupt military police and evil officials who extort them. They feel that in this chaotic world, the power of the government cannot protect them, so they can only rely on the power of God and their own power to protect themselves. Because they feel that only God is selfless, and only divine power and their own struggle can relieve their own suffering. The reason why Innate Taoism can be promoted so rapidly today may be based on this point.</p>
<p>Success is Easy, Failure is Also Easy</p>
<p>A group, if there is no overall planning and strict discipline, is naturally easy to degenerate. Innate Taoism was originally an unorganized mob, but they have the power of a swarm, which will naturally be coveted and used by general swindlers. After becoming public from secrecy, many unscrupulous speculators, mostly bandits, hooligans, villains, and those who attempt to avenge personal grudges, gradually intervened. Their purposes are also inconsistent. Bandits attempt to gain their power and increase their own strength. Hooligans include two types: one is opportunistic and tries to take advantage, and the other is usually hated by farmers and is afraid of being harmed by farmers, so they express repentance in order to preserve their lives. Villains are generally idle people who specialize in making trouble and prefer to turn small things into big things, so they can seize power and profit from it.</p>
<p>As for those who seek revenge for personal grudges, they use the power of Innate Taoism to avenge personal grudges. At first, there was a sense of loyalty between members, and if a member had difficulties, they would compete to help. I heard that a month or two ago, a couple had difficulty living in Shanghai and evacuated back to their hometown. After passing through a checkpoint, they were detained by an inspector who claimed that the items they were carrying were contraband and should be seized. As a result, the man was insulted and his belongings were forcibly taken. After this stimulus, he was silent and depressed, and over time he became ill and died. The wife was deeply saddened, harboring resentment and hatred. At that time, I heard that "Innate Taoism" was popular in the countryside, so she became even more enthusiastic. One day, she let her hair down and said that her husband's ghost had silently told her to take revenge. The farmers believed it to be true, and everyone hated the people in the checkpoint in the countryside, and they were all resentful. So, with one voice, they swarmed towards the checkpoint, with the woman at the head, pushing out her enemy who killed her husband. Without saying a word, knives and guns moved in unison, and he died under the anger of the crowd.</p>
<p>After this turmoil in Innate Taoism, no matter how much the rules say "No illegal money, no collusion with bandits," it is difficult to guarantee that evildoers will not break the rules in secret. As a result, once the members become complicated, the customs become more and more corrupt. After a long time, even the leaders have no power to control, and orders are equal to waste paper. Now, the members of Innate Taoism can be roughly divided into the following five types: Pure farmers account for 50%, bandits and corrupt members account for 10%, hooligans and ruffians account for 20%, those who attempt revenge account for 10%, and the curious and unemployed idlers account for 10%. In a group with such five different thoughts and different purposes, how can the customs not be corrupted? This is the main reason why Innate Taoism is so easy to establish and so easy to fail.

<h3>The Departure of Japan's Special Attack Politics: The Significance of Japan's 87th Extraordinary Diet Session</h3>
<p>The Pacific war situation has gradually approached the decisive battle stage. The battle on Okinawa Island continues to be a bitter struggle under the defensive tactics being employed. The enemy, the United States, is still constantly probing for an opportunity to invade the Japanese mainland. Under this severe situation, Japan's 87th Extraordinary Diet session convened on the 8th and decided to continue the session on the 9th and 10th. Its significance is such that not only must the entire Japanese nation be inspired by it, but our nation must also recognize and pay attention to it.</p>
<p>Japanese Prime Minister Suzuki's policy speech was straightforward and frank. From the talks he gave when he took office and his repeated broadcasts to the nation, he has consistently conveyed the spirit of "dedicating himself to the utmost" in loyalty to the emperor and love for the country. In his inaugural address, Prime Minister Suzuki said, "The great task of reversing the desperate situation rests solely on the shoulders of one hundred million compatriots." In the broadcast upon receiving the imperial mandate, he also said, "The distance between the stubborn enemy and our homeland is decreasing day by day, and the only way to save the crisis is to arouse the people's animosity towards the enemy and to concentrate the nation's total power with one mind." Today, he further elaborates on the previous meaning, believing that although the domestic situation is fraught with difficulties, "if the entire nation can fight bravely and make desperate efforts to defend their respective positions, I am confident that we will be able to overcome the difficulties and achieve the purpose of the war." Prime Minister Suzuki's will is even more determined than before, and his expectations are even more earnest. Under the indiscriminate bombing raids by American aircraft, the Japanese people will surely take Prime Minister Suzuki's will as their own, live up to Prime Minister Suzuki's expectations, unite together, and jointly shoulder the heavy responsibility of resolving the crisis.</p>
<p>There are several points in Prime Minister Suzuki's speech that we must deeply recognize and pay attention to. The analysis is as follows:</p>
<p>First: Prime Minister Suzuki repeatedly clarified the essence of the Greater East Asia War. Japan's motives for waging war are, first, to fight against the tyrannical attitude and insatiable desires of the United States and Britain; second, to fight for Japan's self-preservation and independence; and third, to fight for the security of the entire East Asia. In short, Japan's declaration of war stemmed from justice. Secondly, Prime Minister Suzuki solemnly stated that the founding aspiration of the Japanese Imperial Family lies in "cherishing peace and seeking the well-being of mankind," and "enabling all nations to find their place, and all people to understand the righteousness of humanity and promote culture." From this, it can be further understood that Japan's pursuit of war was originally a measure taken out of necessity. Although the current situation is extremely serious, the future of the war must be deduced from this point of view. Even if it is already well-known, it must be recognized anew.</p>
<p>Second: Regarding Japan's attitude towards war, Prime Minister Suzuki declared twice in his speech, "Having heard that the enemy is now demanding our unconditional surrender, which would destroy our national polity and exterminate our nation, we have no choice but to fight to the end." He also said, "Observing the trends in the enemy's domestic situation and the direction of international affairs, one cannot help but painfully feel that we have no choice but to fight to the end, and there is no other way to go." Japan's direction of war is very clear, and all enemy rumors will be self-defeating.</p>
<p>Third: Prime Minister Suzuki stated the fundamental principle of Japan's courtesy towards the Greater East Asia and world order: "To establish a path of security that does not threaten or invade." The expression of this sentence is very powerful. Secondly, he declared, "We express our support for the opportunity for the Republic of China to unify and save the country." We must pay attention to this. In mid-April, various regions in our country held "Wartime People's Representative Congresses" and put forward the proposition of unifying and saving the country. Now that it has received Prime Minister Suzuki's response and support, the movement to unify and save the country must be promoted and realized.</p>
<p>Fourth: The Japanese mainland has now become an iron-walled fortress. The decisive battle on the Japanese mainland is the only key point at present. Prime Minister Suzuki, who is familiar with strategy, naturally knows the advantageous conditions, so he said, "If the homeland becomes a battlefield, we will have ten thousand times more advantages than the enemy in terms of geographical advantage and popular support." The so-called "the victory or defeat of the war depends on the last five minutes" in the war situation report by Navy Minister Yonai also lies in this. The decisive battle on the Japanese mainland has become an inevitable and important strategy to achieve the purpose of the war. Therefore, the mission of this extraordinary Diet session is to complete the posture of the decisive battle on the homeland.</p>
<p>The great significance of this extraordinary Diet session is as revealed in Prime Minister Suzuki's speech. Judging from the agenda, the goals of the discussion can be divided into the following two points:</p>
<p>First, the concentration of political power for the decisive battle. The most noteworthy "Wartime Emergency Measures Law" does not base its content on Article 31 of the Constitution, which pertains to "extraordinary powers," but in practice, it grants the government full authority over the Diet. This is a precursor to the government's implementation of decisive battle politics and an emergency measure to transform Japanese politics from pluralistic to monolithic.</p>
<p>Second, the universality of military power for the decisive battle. Two of the six bills submitted by the Japanese government to the extraordinary Diet session concern the National Volunteer Corps. The organization of the National Volunteer Corps is not only the hope of the Japanese government but also the hope of the Japanese people. The significance of the discussion of this volunteer service bill lies not only in providing a legal basis for the National Volunteer Corps movement but also in serving as a mobilization order for the joint uprising of one hundred million Japanese compatriots.</p>
<p>In short, the entire Japanese homeland, regardless of its key areas, material elements, or human elements, must be equipped within the system of the decisive battle. Japan's strong political power must overcome all difficulties to shoulder this major task. Japanese politics will, without distinction between the Diet and the government, implement special attack politics with the spirit of one hundred million special attackers. The unprecedented significance of this extraordinary Diet session in Japan is the departure point for Japan's special attack politics.</p>
<h3>Japan Implements Decisive Battle Administration: Establishes Local General Supervision Departments; Lt. Gen. Nishio and Others to Serve as General Supervisors</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) – In order to implement decisive battle local administration, the Japanese government has decided to establish local general supervision departments in the administrative council locations of one circuit and seven regions nationwide. The current chairmen of the local administrative councils will serve as the local general supervisors. This morning, the general supervisors held an imperial audience ceremony in the presence of Prime Minister Suzuki. The names of the general supervisors are as follows: Hokkaido General Supervisor Kumagai Hajime, Tohoku Regional General Supervisor Maruyama Tsuruyo, Kanto-Shinetsu Regional General Supervisor concurrently Governor of Tokyo, Lt. Gen. Nishio Toshizo, Tokai-Hokuriku Regional General Supervisor Ko Tadaharu, Kinki Regional General Supervisor Yasui Eiji, Chugoku Regional General Supervisor Otsuka Koremasa, Shikoku Regional General Supervisor Kimura Masayoshi, Kyushu Regional General Supervisor Totsuka Kuichiro.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) – This spring, in January, Prime Minister Koiso took measures to promote the coordination of defense and administration and to expedite the operation of policies, strengthening the connection between the chairman of the cooperative council and the commander of the military and the commander of the naval base. In order to strengthen the comprehensive operation of local administration, the Japanese government has now dissolved the local administrative councils and created a local general supervision department system based on the council's area as a unit, serving as a powerful administrative organ responsible for overseeing and supervising the local administration within its jurisdiction, in order to establish a self-reliant and self-sufficient posture in each region. According to the official system regulations, the local general supervision department is a purely administrative agency with the power to direct and supervise the local offices and special local offices within its jurisdiction. Thus, Japan's domestic administration operating mechanism is divided into three levels: the government, the local general supervision department, and the local office. A total of eight local general supervision departments are established according to the council areas. The local general supervisor is an imperial appointment official, and six local deputy general supervisors are appointed below him as imperial appointments officials. What is even more noteworthy is that in the past, the chairman of the council also served as the governor of the prefecture in that area, but in the future, the local general supervisor and the governor will be appointed separately. However, due to regional considerations, the Shikoku region and the Hokkaido region will still be held concurrently.</p>
<h3>Trieste Issue: Three Countries Sign Agreement; Southern and Northwestern Borderline Delineated</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 10th (Central News Agency) – According to news received here last night, the agreement between the British, American, and Yugoslav governments regarding the occupation and provisional administration of Trieste and the Slovenian coastal area was signed yesterday in Belgrade. This agreement will serve as the basic principle for the representatives of the Yugoslav military and the representatives of the United Nations military in establishing other necessary agreements in the future. According to an official announcement from London, the border line between the United Nations and Yugoslavia has been delineated from the southern region of Trieste, north through Gorizia, to Villach (i.e., Carinthia) on the Austrian border. West of this border line, the entire Venezia Giulia area will be under the jurisdiction of General Alexander, the Supreme Commander of the United Nations forces in the Mediterranean. East of this border line, it will all be under the control of the Yugoslav government. At the same time, a small part of the Yugoslav army (approximately 2,000 troops) will remain in the western part of the border line to form a joint administration agency directly under the command of General Alexander.</p>
<h3>Hitler: His Fate Uncertain</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency) – Reuters special correspondent, H. Beattie, stated that General Zhukov told United Nations reporters today, "Two days before the fall of Berlin, Führer Hitler held a wedding ceremony with a movie actress named Braun."</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 10th (Central News Agency) – According to a British correspondent stationed in Moscow, Lieutenant Colonel Bursarin, the commander of the Soviet garrison in Berlin, revealed his personal opinion yesterday, stating that Führer Hitler has not yet died and will inevitably be placed somewhere in Europe in the future, or he may live with Spanish leader General Franco. Although we have repeatedly found corpses that closely resemble Führer Hitler, we have not yet dared to assert that he is definitely dead. At the same time, General Zhukov also stated that Führer Hitler's marriage to the actress Braun is a fact. When the German General Staff headquarters fell into the hands of the Soviet army, it was found in a part of the adjutant's daily record book that there was an entry regarding Hitler's marriage.</p>

The taxable base is based on the actual business volume of each industry in January, February, and March of this year. It is reported that the summer business tax, which the bureau is actively levying, is handled in accordance with the various articles stipulated in the recently revised business tax regulations.

<h3>Financial and Commodity Prices Continued to Rise Sharply Last Week</h3>
<p>The financial and industrial and commercial market conditions in Shanghai continued to change drastically in the past week, and the trend has become increasingly dangerous. Due to rumors and volatility, people's minds are restless, and the speculative market is active. Those who have funds are manipulating the market for profit, and the black market has risen and fallen dramatically, repeatedly hitting new highs. Large households are buying in and refusing to sell. Although the third installment of gold securities has been issued, it is difficult to curb the increase in the official price and the high prices on the black market. Only on Wednesday did it see a slight rebound, but it soon rose again, jumping 30 major points compared to the previous period. Silver also continued to rise. Allied banknotes rose steadily, which is considered stable. Although the authorities strictly prohibit enemy currency, it is still difficult to eliminate secret transactions. The price increase is particularly severe, but the drop is also large. Chinese stocks continued to rise. On Wednesday, due to the tightening of credit, a general limit down was once reached. On Thursday afternoon, the upward trend resumed, and the upward trend was even more severe on Friday. On Saturday morning, the market rose and then fell during the half-day session. People's minds are firm, and the buying wind is still strong. However, the three popular stocks, namely the American-Asian, Wing On, and Yarn Factory companies, are trending weakly, because they have been raised too high, and the volatility is very dangerous. The appetite of buyers is relatively weak. Small and medium-sized stocks. In terms of industry and commerce, due to the rise in the black market, and the difficulty in obtaining production raw materials, holders are reluctant to sell. In addition, asset holders are hoarding, causing a wave of price increases. The price of grain has risen by tens of thousands of yuan in one week. Coarse grains, oil, sugar, fuel, coal, and firewood have successively risen by 80% to 100%. Among daily necessities, the market prices of soap, matches, and cotton fabrics such as gauze, silk, and wool have exceeded 100%. Vegetable market prices have risen without any standards. The marked prices of goods sold by various companies and shops change several times a day, exceeding the door-to-door limited price approved by the Commodity Price Review Committee by three to four times. However, it has not been heard that the authorities have taken any measures. The Commodity Price Review Committee has not yet announced the implementation of the recently reviewed commodity prices. Citizens believe that if swift commodity price reviews and strict implementation of new limited prices are not adopted, the livelihood of ordinary people in society will be unimaginable, and the impact on people's livelihood and public order will be a cause for concern.</p>

<h3>Baobing [Neighborhood Watch] and Evacuation</h3>
<p>— Jin Xiongbai</p>
<p>Mr. Jin Xiongbai, member of the Baobing Publicity Committee of the Shanghai Municipal District and President of the Pingbao Newspaper, broadcast the following speech on Shanghai Radio at 7:00 PM on the 10th: "Since the government implemented the Baobing system, the security and defense of Shanghai have made significant progress. In peacetime, the Baobing can supplement the insufficient strength of the military and police, ensuring the safety of our homes. In times of crisis, they can help each other, reducing unnecessary harm. Especially in wartime, such as air raids and fires, it is even more necessary for the Baobing to be united and work together. In the past, we saw a great shortcoming, which was the belief that serving in the Baobing was merely a government decree, a citizen's obligation. All the things that the Baobing should do were done with a perfunctory attitude. This is truly regrettable. Because our homes are our homes, and this place is a place we all share. By pooling the small amount of effort that each individual makes, we can make every home and the entire place as solid as a rock. The results and benefits we receive are our own. Therefore, we should all make the greatest effort to make the Baobing organization strict and its strength effective. If we continue with the current perfunctory state, we will only waste manpower and resources. Such a formalistic Baobing will be in a panic and helpless when accidents occur. In the end, we will still suffer ourselves. Therefore, I first appeal to all citizens to pay attention to the Baobing.</p>
<p>Reduce Losses and Preserve National Strength</p>
<p>Speaking of the evacuation problem, there are many practical reasons why people cannot leave. The common ailment of Shanghai citizens is that they do not have a firm will of their own. They all look at what others are doing and follow suit. If we continue to procrastinate in this way, we will not be able to leave when the time comes. Everyone, why put your family's life at risk in this way!</p>
<p>We know that evacuating the population under the threat of air control is to reduce damage and preserve national strength. In densely populated large cities, casualties are inevitable in the event of an air raid. Although we cannot completely eliminate the threat of air raids, we must find ways to minimize the damage. Manpower is the only resource in wartime, and we must cherish it, value it, and therefore, we must not ignore the dangers that manpower may encounter and try our best to eliminate or reduce those dangers. Therefore, evacuation work is truly the most important and necessary thing to do in Shanghai at present.</p>
<p>Secondly, the seriousness of the current food problem in Shanghai is an undeniable fact. The sharp increase in rice prices means that the common people will be unable to solve their "eating problem." This time, the rise in rice prices is somewhat different from the past, because rice prices in various places are gradually rising. Even in areas known for rice production, the same situation exists. Therefore, the increase in rice prices in Shanghai is unlikely to be reversed in the short term. Furthermore, along with the rise in rice prices, the market price of miscellaneous grains is also gradually increasing. In this way, the panic over the food problem is becoming more and more serious. Today's citizens should voluntarily evacuate. Those who have homes in the countryside should return home, and those who do not should go to their relatives and friends. Although rice prices in the countryside are more expensive, they are still lower than in Shanghai. The supply of food is also easier than in Shanghai, and the risk of air raids is also much better than in Shanghai. Why are the citizens not willing to evacuate?</p>
<p>The Bureau and folk leaders have already established a Population Evacuation Committee, which is scheduled to carry out the first evacuation starting on the 11th. Citizens who want to go can register at the offices in each district. If they hesitate and fail to move forward, missing the opportunity to evacuate, they may suffer damage in the future. Then it will be too late to regret it.</p>
<p>Now is not the time for theory, but the time for thorough implementation. To implement this important work, it must be done with the cooperation of all citizens, especially the Baobing, who must take on a very important role.</p>
<p>Use the Baobing to Promote Evacuation</p>
<p>Although the organization of the Shanghai Baobing has only a short history, it has generally laid a foundation. How to use the Baobing organization to promote the practice of evacuation is a major issue for the Baobing at present. We know that the public's lack of knowledge, superficial understanding, and insufficient judgment have led to the habit of treating most things, regardless of their importance, with indifference. The failure to thoroughly carry out the evacuation work is also one of the reasons. In the future, the Baobing personnel must explain the necessity of evacuation to each household in a sincere manner, and at the same time, inquire about their family situation and work environment. Those who do not need to stay in Shanghai should be persuaded to evacuate immediately. If there are any difficulties, they must also help to solve them, which will be of great benefit to the country and the people. Only in this way can the mission of evacuation be completed and the purpose of evacuation be achieved.</p>
<p>Everyone, the war has reached a decisive stage, and the dangers of war and the panic of food shortages are unavoidable facts. The countryside is definitely better than the city. The density of the population in Shanghai is such that the consequences of a major air raid are unimaginable. In terms of food, we are now in the transition period, and transportation is particularly difficult. The situation is getting more and more serious day by day. The security situation is also worrying. Now is not the time to stand still. Everyone, do not gamble with your life and family because you are greedy for the comfort of life in Shanghai. Evacuate quickly, evacuate as soon as possible!</p>
<h3>Business License: Penalties for Late Renewal</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government promulgated the Provisional Rules on Penalties for Late Renewal of Business Licenses by the Bureau of Finance:</p>
<p>All shops, hotels, apartments, entertainment venues, and market stalls in the city, regardless of whether they hold monthly, quarterly, or semi-annual licenses, must, upon expiration, continue to operate in accordance with the time limit prescribed in these rules for self-payment and renewal of the license. Those who fail to pay beyond the time limit will be penalized separately according to the provisions of these penalty rules.</p>
<p>Those who hold a monthly license should pay and renew the license themselves within the month. Those who fail to pay beyond the time limit will be charged a late payment penalty of one time the amount due. Those who fail to pay for more than two months will be charged a late payment penalty of two times the amount due, and their business may be suspended. The due license fee and late payment penalty will be recovered.</p>
<p>Those who hold a semi-annual license shall, from the date of the prescribed collection, pay and renew the license themselves within two months. Those who fail to pay beyond the time limit will be charged a late payment penalty of 50 percent of the amount due. Those who fail to pay beyond two months will be charged a late payment penalty of one time the amount due. Those who fail to pay beyond two months will be charged a late payment penalty of two times the amount due. Those who fail to pay beyond three months will be charged a late payment penalty of three times the amount due, and their business may be suspended. The due license fee and late payment penalty will be recovered.</p>
<p>The amount of the fine imposed in accordance with these rules shall first be determined and notified to the person being fined, and a receipt for the fine shall be issued when the fine is paid.</p>

<h3>Introduction to Amateur Library</h3>
<p>With soaring prices, books and magazines are no exception, but spiritual food is indispensable, so libraries are particularly needed.</p>
<p>The China Amateur Library was formerly founded by the China Vocational Education Society. It has a collection of more than 20,000 books, with literature and social science books being the most numerous. In recent months, a large number of new books published by Commercial Press and World Book Company have been added, with emphasis on drama, natural sciences, and applied technology.</p>
<p>The original site was on the seventh floor of the Pudong Building. After the elevator stopped running, readers felt very inconvenient. Now it has been moved to the second floor of 80 Yandang Road (formerly Hualong Road). The procedures remain the same as before. Circulation and borrowing have already started at the new location.</p>
<p>In order to cover expenses, the library charges 200 yuan per month, but in order to take care of the poor and needy, there are also "free" quotas. There is no limit to the number of places. A brochure can be obtained from the library. (Chen Wei)</p>
