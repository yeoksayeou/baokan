<h3>相親愛互尊諒建設新東亞陳代主席訓詞原文</h3>
<p>南京五日中央社電　陳代主席對全國青少年團第三次總檢閱大會訓詞原文如下：今天是三十四年的青年節，同時舉行全國青少年團第三次總檢閱，廣塲上集合着數千個生氣蓬勃的全國各地靑少年代表，並得盟邦日本靑少年代表愚臨參加，充分表現出青年中國的中國青年組微與力量，本人至感快慰。在中國革命史上，青年留下光輝燦爛的事蹟，現在革命過程中，正遭遇到空前的難關，祖國的命運有如千鈞繫於一髮，我們要突破難關，把祖國挽救回來，復興起來，進而使東亞得到解放，得到安定，必須全國民眾精誠團結，把全部人力與物力責獻給國家，而靑年是社會的中堅，青年首先要實踐興華保亞的工作，領導民眾，實踐興華保亞的工作。最近全國民眾倡導統一救國遝動，已經蓬蓬勃勃的發展，靑年的統一救國述動，也正在蓬蓬勃勃的發展，全國青年，無論在江浙，在兩廣，在四川，在直冀，在甘陜，都是中華民國的同胞，都是黃帝的子孫，都愛自己的祖國，只有共產黨徒，他們背叛國家，戕殺同胞，騙人民於水深火熱之中，施行赤化政策，我們必須展開反共的鬥爭，把共匪荼　下的青年與同胞搶救回來。汪故主席生前倡這新國民運動，又以靑少年遝動爲新運工作的重點，組織與訓練全國國民與青少年，在三民主義旗幟下，完成國民革命的大業，自從去年汪故主席逝世後，半年以來，國際情勢如此的險惡，國內情勢如此的混亂，希望全國青少年站穩自己的崗位，多多鍛鍊自己，訓練自己，充實自己，了解自身責任的重大，强固自身的組織，完成國父與汪故主席的遺志，建設光明燦爛的中華民國。更希望中·日兩國青少年，全東亞各地青少年，相親相愛，互尊互諒，共同奮鬥，建設自由解放的新東亞。</p>

<h3>渝國民黨召開六全大會</h3>
<p>中央社訊　據重慶情報，渝國民黨於五月五日舉行第六次全國代表大會，此次大會主要議題，爲決定本年十一月十二日召開國民大會及附議憲法草案等。</p>
<h3>鈴木首相素描</h3>
<p>組閣的大命下降於鈴木貫太郎大將時，他正負着樞密院議長的重責。當時，就起來眞是無禮，竟有人發出「以七十九歲的老軀猶站在國民陣頭嗎」的不安之聲。除出道位至誠盡忠的人以外，無人能够擔當日本今日的局而。日本國民知道了鈴木大將是這樣一位人物時，纔放下了心。背負着日本時局的老宰相鈴木貫大郎大將，自從組閣以來，每天是怎樣奮鬥過來的呢？得到日木一億國民衷心的聲援而想引導此戰勝利的，是七十九歲的鈴木貫太郎大將。</p>
<p>首相的風格</p>
<p>不論誰會過鈴木貫太郎大將以後，都會感到他不是大眾的政治家。他旣不是所謂「大眾的」，也不是「政治家」，而是一位眞正的大將。今日就任首相以後，最能得人心的，也就是道一點。過去因爲沒有機會和民眾接觸，所以就任首相以後，如何觸及國民的心底，如何把握國民的呼聲，就成爲鈴木首相最深思苦慮的一點。這是接近鈴木氏的人說的。鈴木首相頗願坦懷聽取國民率直的意見和要求。自從組閣以來，鈴木首相正在不聲不饗中繼續邁進。</p>
<p>鈴木大將任首相以後，第一次出現於街頭是四月十五日的視察東京災區。當時，祗帶了一名秘書。四月十三日夜的空製，小石川的首相私邸附近，化爲一片火海。由於敬慕首相的人們以及警察官決死的消防活動，在廣大的火災區中，保全了相府及其鄰近區域，然而也曾一度極其危險。當時鈴木大將正在大塚某空地，混在一班首都市民中，互相策勵，一同避在防空壕裏。這時燭國燒夷彈紛落如雨，誰也不知道那個老人竟是總理大臣，直到一個國民學校的敎師喊道：「啊呀，那不是鈴木先生嗎！」大家方才認識。</p>
<p>那天晚上，鈴木首相當然整夜未睡，但在十四日上午四時半，他照常到官邸去辦公，而且比往日還要忙一點。那天晚上的廣播，也出於首相自已的意思。廣播以後，他覺得還不夠，因而又有第二天的巡視災區之舉。從官邸出發時，首相說：「眞想送一點什麼禮物給災民呢！」可是平素過着極儉樸的生活的首相家庭，一時實在找不出什麼適當的物品。「那末就把我這個點心送給他們，盡力去安慰一下災民吧？」</p>
<p>秘書官會談</p>
<p>足以表現首相希望實行儂貼民心的政治的，有一個會談。這就是每天下午九時起首相必和鈴木一。鈴木武。西村直己三秘書官會談。在鈴木大將任首相以前，只要沒有特別的事情，凡希望面會者，都可很快的得到會晤的機會；這是鈴木大將家的慣例。就任首相以後，鈴木大將曾對他的秘書們說道：</p>
<p>「我願會見任何人，聽無論那一個的話。」</p>
<p>不過，首相當然沒有接見每一個人的道理，因此有時是由秘書官代爲接見的。這三位秘書官，每夜將日裹所聞見的一切不分巨細的報告老宰相。自從鈴木內閣誕生以來，寄呈首相官邸的信札，條陳，逐日不下百通，首相自然也無這樣多的閒暇一一閱其內容，而由秘書官代拆轉告。每夜的會談，因此總在一小時以上。</p>
<p>必勝之決心</p>
<p>上午五時起床，下午十時就寢，這是鈴木大將的日課，但任首相以來，這個規律是打破了。就職時的第一聲：「願埋老軀於國民諸君的最前列！」這決不是一句形容詞。兩大三天泰然徹夜不睡的那種精神，似已趕走了七十九歲的高齡。側近的人雖勸他「勿過分辛勞」，首相卻仍舊精神嬰鑠，不以爲意。據其側近的一位說，那種勸吿是會玷汚首相決死的心理的</p>
<p>生性至誠，以至誠奉公而相信大東亞戰爭必勝，時而慰藉國民，時而激勵國民，就是這位鈴木老宰相！（譯自四月二十一日朝日新聞）</p>
<p>星期評論</p>
<h3>重慶六全大會評述</h3>
<p>— 朱克家</p>
<p>重慶國民黨於（五月五日）起，召開第六屆全國代表大會，似乎以討論戰爭結束後的政治　領爲中心。就此間所可得見的消息觀察，其主要議題，將集中於　召集國民大會之具體問題，　五五憲章之最後決定問題，　修改國民黨政綱問題案等。從中國國民黨五十年來艱苦當鬥的歷史來看，除了民國十三年在孫中山先生親自領導下的一全大會以外，自以這次「六全大會」意義較爲車大，因爲預定討論的上述三項問題，對內對外各方面，都爲客觀上的重要關係。但是，這是照戯台上標貼的節目單所作的觀察，實際上戯還是戯，但看禍去多少次同樣的連台好戯，台上演唱得儘管精彩百出，台下監管彩聲雷動，結果對於國家民族的利益又有什麼成效可言，老百姓今天對於任何好戲已失去魅力，所期待的不是演唱的動聽，而是拯救國家命脈的實踐！</p>
<p>至於實踐問題，過去使國人失望的舊事不必車提了，就以今日重慶「六全大會」的主題來說：召集國民大會原是二十年來國民所共同盼望著的，但是所得到的只是聽聽黨員朗誦總理遺囑中的動人字句，和當局再三的失信。現在縱然決定舉行，但是國民如何推派眞正的代表？代表如何行使其職權而制定國家基本大法。重慶國民黨政機顯然沒有令人滿意的答覆。誠如重慶的中國民主政團同盟宣言（本年一月三十日）所說：「如僅僅將二十五·六年所選出之一部份代表，再就無法選舉之若干省份指派若干代表，符合一千四百四十名額，更益以數百名國民黨中委及候補中委爲當然委員，以此而欲制定一部全國共遵之憲法，以此而居然言還致於民，並欲以此而成就全國的團結統一，吾人認爲其結果必將廻得其反」。其實，民主政團同盟中人，難道還不知重慶當局的用心所在？實際上，中國人民莫不渴望早日召開眞正的全體的國民代表大會，商決國是，實行憲政，但是必待全國和平統一之後，才有實現可能，否則，就是實現了，也只是全國不足三分之一地域一部份人的意見，將來決不能解決整個的國是，徒增未來的紛歧而已。</p>
<p>持平而論，重慶召集的「六全大會」，實際上未能消除個人及黨派的私心，因此未能獲得國民之擁護與信任，是意想中事。我們必須鄭重指出：「大道之行，天下爲公」，現在重慶國民黨的六全大會，只知巧立名目，實岡保持及擴展個人與私黨的權利，常然不會有何成效的前途。然而縱觀大局，嚴果已極，國人若不迅圖全國和平統一，則內戰外患，兵連禍結，巾華民族，沉淪堪膚。深願全國上下，其速猛省！脚踏實地，統一團結，爲中國爲東亞爭取生存。</p>
<h3>戰巡特設空母等被擊沉毀十六艘琉球周圍日特攻隊戰果</h3>
<p>南西諸島基地五日中央社電　日特攻隊及航空部隊，　續猛攻琉球周國之敵艦船羣，自三日至四日傍晚，所得戰績如次：　三日六時四十分在永良部島鄰近極沉驅逐艦一艘。　自三日晚至四日晨，在名護　方面發見大火柱三條，小火柱三條，又在本島西方海面得見三十處發生大火。　三日上午在嘉手納洋面，得見敵方輕巡洋艦（一萬噸級）發生大火，歷數小時之久，黑姻衝天。　三日在慶良間列島洋面，擊沉艦型不明者一艘。　四日在永良部島西南八十公里之海面，轟沉戰艦二艘，巡洋艦二艘，又攻破其艦型不明者五艘。　破毀巡洋艦或驅逐艦三艘。　四日上午在慶良問列島南方海面破毀特設空母一艘（似已擊沉），　四日上午十時左右，在慶良問列島方面，聽見大爆炸之音饗十三次，該島泰半被白姻所跪罩。又日軍在琉球木島攻擊敵方飛行塲，無稍懈怠，使其處處發生大火。</p>

<p>南北九州擊落敵機</p>
<p>福岡五日中央社電　馬里亞納基地之B29型敵機，連日賡績來襲九州地區，即三日八十餘架，四日六十餘架來製。又五日上午六時半左右，復有B29型敵機二十八架，由足摺岬鄰近飛入，在豐後水道集結後，其中十架經由國本半島來製久留米地區，其餘十八架編成二隊，來炸大分地區，是日，日制空部隊在應豫海峽空中及築後平野勇敢邀擊敵機，敵機忽亂其隊伍，單機經由豐後小道飛逃而去，此役，在久留米平野擊落一架，在阿蘇波野及佐伯鄰近亦各擊落一架。又在佐伯鄰近燒毀一架。此外，在豐豫海峽空中打擊敵機頗多，業已證實，更有兩架敵機似爲哨戒轟炸機PBM型者，諒由慶良間列島起飛，於五日上午九時半左右，由鹿兒島縣西南方面北進，飛至壹岐鄰近，以熣槍掃射航行巾之艦隻，然後由小呂島鄰近轉向西南方飛去，但船隻未受害。</p>
<p>福岡五日巾央社電　敵機B29型於五日上午來炸北九州之後，繼於下午三時左右調動三十八架來炸南九州，以八架至十架編成四隊，由人隅半島侵入在鹿兒島灣周圍之日航空基地擲彈後，至五時半左右始向志布志灣東南方飛去。</p>

<h3>國府明令褒揚朱履龢</h3>
<p>頒給治喪費十萬元</p>
<p>南京五日中央社電　國府三十四年五月四日令，任命彭羲明爲內政部常務次長，此令。兼新運促進會浙江分會主任委員項致莊另有任用，項致莊應免兼職，此令。特派工默邨兼新運促進會浙江分會主任委員，此令。司法院副院長兼中央公務員微戒委員會委員朱履龢，書宿碩望，法學湛深，早歲追隨國父疊任外交司法要職，勤勞卓著，聲績斐然，自還都後，洊任今職，翊贊和軍，建樹尤多，時艱共濟，倚畀方深，詎以積勞，在任溘逝，撫念賢良，彌甚軫悼，特予褒楊，頒給治喪費十萬元，並着交行政院轉飭銓叙部從優哉恤，以彰政府篤念賢勞之至意，此令。</p>
<h3>杜尼資勗勵德軍繼績對蘇抗戰西部孤軍向英美投降</h3>
<p>瑞典京城五日中央社電　據德國電台報告：德國新元首杜尼資將軍今日向德國中部南部及東南部之德軍廣播如次：「目前德軍仍須作戰之唯一目的，爲將德國民眾由「布爾希維克化」及「奴隸化」中搶救出來，此爲汝等最神聖之工作。此項工作必能於將來在故元首之精神中及保衛國民之精神中付諸實現。但是有誰單爲本身之生存打算，非但不能拯救整個社會，抑几爲德國民眾之公敵，我人必採同樣手段對付之。若無條件之順服，與如鐵一般的原有鋼紀以及各方面之合作，此時應較昔日更予重視。又如北方西方南方之德孤軍，已於光榮掙扎之後放下武器，但再欲對西方諸國作奮戰，已成爲毫無意義矣。</p>
<p>瑞典京城五日中央社電　據倫敦消息：眾信杜尼資大將領導下之德政府，已遷往挪威，傳德新元首昨與駐丹麥挪威之德行政要員進行商討。</p>
<p>瑞典京城五日中央社電　據倫敦觀察家稱：荷蘭。德西北部及丹麥之德軍，對蒙高茂萊將軍投降，此與在義大利及西部奧地利境之德軍，對亞歷山大元帥投降之事件兩相合併，於是做成此後不再有德軍對西方反軸心軍抗戰之形勢。在理論上。挪威之德海陸空軍及在法各港口及愛琴海之德軍。仍可繼　抗戰，但德軍現僅對東來之敵人抗戰。</p>
<p>瑞典京城五日中央社電　據丹麥廣播德元首大本營四日公報稱：梅格倫堡區德軍於激戰後。開入易北河西岸之反軸心軍佔領地帶，放下武器投降</p>
<h3>艾森霍華聲明澈底擊毀德軍</h3>
<p>蘇黎世五日中央社電　艾森　華於四日聲明：吾人將於陸海空三方面，澈底擊毀德軍，現在要求投降者，僅爲殘敗之德軍。</p>
<h3>邱吉爾仍留居倫敦靜候事態發展</h3>
<p>瑞典京城五日中央社電　德國投降之講傳滿佈歐陸，倫敦電台以「迫在眉睫」之語氣，加以形容，英首相邱吉爾將親對英人宣佈此項消息。渠今日仍於唐寗街官邸，曾出席於議會，但僅歷二分鐘之時間而已，共辦公室置有播音器，準備該投降消息到達時，即對國會宣佈。自舊金山方面初傳希姆萊議和之消息，自中立國及自戰塲方面傳來集體或零星之投降報告，每分鐘均如雪片飛來，但仍未能證實蒙高茂萊元帥直接與德新元首談判投降之消息，但局勢極具流動性，無論何事均有發生之可能。德軍之零星投降，此爲德軍僅欲網續抵抗數日之顯示，但仍有理由可信戰事未能即日結東者，因仍有德國潛艇百艘作戰於海外，反軸心當候彼等全部歸還，以示眞意。但由於國內安全部之訓令，準備慶祝勝利日之事實，此事爲反軸心不不能等待過久之暗示。</p>
<h3>袋形包圍圈內德軍百五十萬仍繼績從事抵抗</h3>
<p>瑞典京城五日中央社電　常此英美蘇以大軍掃蕩德軍之殘留抵抗據點時，全世界之辦公室正散播德國即將投降之藎言，對反軸心將發出投降最後通牒之可能性，各方面均加以有力之推斷，該牒將使繼續抵抗之德人，不受法律之保護。與渡基爾運河有同樣重要性者，即對自反軸心於易北河橋頭堡突破後所投降之五十萬德軍之處置問題，英軍對此正感棘手。</p>
<p>據反軸心觀察家稱，於歐陸各部之各袋形包團圈內，約有德軍一百五十萬，繼續從事抵抗，茲將其主要區域露布如下：　挪成波美將軍指揮之德第二十軍，約有十五萬至三十萬之眾，擁有潛艇三百艘及小量之飛機。　捷克斯洛伐克·東部奧地利·西北部南斯拉夫·巴伐利亞之一小部，胡勒將軍指揮之第八軍一部，仍在捷克抗戰。　凱塞林元帥指揮之第一及第十九軍之殘餘，及奧地利東部。巴伐利亞區內，仍有少數衝鋒隊，奧境仍有德第六軍及第八軍之一部，第二及第六裝甲軍殘部，或仍在該地。　南斯拉夫境內或仍有六至十師軍隊存在，此袋內之德軍，其力相當强大，約有三十五萬人之眾。　荷蘭西部克里斯得安森將軍所指揮之第二十五軍約有十萬之衆。　拉脫維亞之里巴週圍五千平方里內，約有十五至三十師德軍繼續抵抗。　北方袋形區內，於易北河埃姆斯河間之數師德軍，正在防衛埃姆登。威廉港。　希臘南百愛琴海中羣島，前謂有德軍一萬駐於克里特島，二萬分佈認羅得島上。　在柏格及臺莎之間，於美蘇軍會師之地點，仍有不知確數德軍被圍。　法國港口區共有九萬一千之衆，鄧扣克港有一萬二千名，羅利翁港有二萬五千名，聖最那爾港有三萬五千名，羅許塞勒港有一萬九千名。　　英吉利海峽間之小島上，仍有二萬至三萬一千之德軍，在北海之佛里西安羣島及黑爾鄂蘭島上，有不知確數之德軍及海軍陸戰隊，海拉半島上仿有數千德軍存在</p>
<h3>舊金山會議票決問題</h3>
<p>美蘇意見相左</p>
<p>里斯本四日中央社電　據舊金山電：彼蘭問題仿爲舊金山會議之難關，今則因票決問題，美蘇兩國意見相左。蓋美國主張多數表決主義，而蘇聯則主張三分之二以上之絕對過半數主義，因白俄。烏克蘭兩共和國及阿根廷被招請參加結果，現在出席國總數爲四十九國，如照美國之主張，則會議之票決以二十五票之贊成投　，便可通過，如照蘇聯之主張，則至少需要三十三票。而美國所以主張多數決者，因美洲二十一國，加以美之傀儡國利比亞及菲律賓計有二十三國，故其餘如再獲得二國之支持，則美國可任意操縱該會；但蘇聯澈底主張三分之二之過半數主義，其態度頗强硬云。</p>
<h3>殖民地問題與日本之立塲</h3>
<p>日本大使館上海事務所</p>
<p>— 松平情報部長</p>
<p>中日民族爭取獨立</p>
<p>歐洲各國先後在美洲·菲洲·印度·澳洲旣南洋各地攫得殖民地，凡歐洲以外之地域，一有間隙，即爲彼等染指，之後遂及於日本與中國，或要求闢商埠通商貿易，或要求對基督敎傳敎予以便利，用種種方法日漸侵蝕，因此東亞之獨立國家，次第減亡，或實權操諸他人之手，呻吟於帝國主義各國之支配與榨取下，大東亞民族中半數以上示　處在此種狀態下。唯有日本·中國·泰國勉强維持獨立的名義，但遠在百年之前，已形成半獨立狀態，有將淪爲殖民地之勢，對日本最先覺悟爭取完全獨立，中國亦發起國民革命，　求完全獨立，泰國亦爲此積極努力。</p>
<p>英美採取惡毒政策</p>
<p>盎格魯撤克遜渡往美洲，彼如何處理印第安人？又如何處理澳洲之土著居民？盎格魯撤克遜採取決不與土著居民妥協，將其全部殺盡之惡毒政策。吾人祇須一讀盎格魯撤克遜之美洲開拓史澳洲開拓史，即可明瞭彼等之方法是利己的，不人道的。拉丁民族向南美發展之方法，係採取妥協方式，顧及土著居民利益，或兩族通婚或融合文化。盎格魯撤克遜則不然，實爲世界上最可怖之民族，彼等非但不使各民族各得其所，且用武力攫奪，此種行爲即爲引起戰爭之主要原因。易言之，即戰爭之眞正原因在英美法荷等國擁有廣大且豐饒之領土與殖民地，超過其人口比例，而不加開放所致。如英國有最廣大之殖民地，平均每一英國人可支配十七名異民族，此種不合理狀態，爲造成戰爭之原因。</p>
<p>殖民資源分配問題</p>
<p>距今十二三年前，世界學者爲提倡避免戰爭，殖民地之分配須加調整。一九三五年九月美國霍斯大佐會論及此問題，渠主張將殖民地資源重加分配，頗引起各國注意。翌年十月十七日，在國際職盟總會中通過設立原料資源問題委員會，當時日本雖已退出國際聯盟，但仍被邀請加入，由駐德大使館首滕商務書記官代表日本參加該委員會。至一九三七年三月八日開會，英國代表利斯洛主張如次：　反對領土之再分割，　反對開放殖民地門戶，舊殖民地經濟與本國經濟關係不可分，如開放殖民地，則往往阻碍殖民地之發展，有害居民之福祉。　獲得原料極屬困難。日本首藤書記官，遵照日政府訓令主張：一，勞力，技術，資本可自由移入一切土地，二，撤廢各國輪出原料資源之限制，三，芟除通商障碍，以關於開放殖民地之貢格盆地條約適用於全世界殖民地等三點，關明開放殖民地之主張。然會議之發起人，英國力避解決重要問題，而南菲聯邦，荷蘭，加拿大，法國等代表均支持英國主張，致會議全告失敗。日本之主張並非僅該次會議之首藤氏提案，一九三六年一月，日本開第六十八屆議會，廣田外務大臣演說中，亦主張通商自由，門戶開放，交通自由，資源均霑。翌年在有田外相議會外交方針演說中，更進一步關明日木政府開放殖民地之具儂方針，主張貢格盆地條约適用於全世界各殖民地，關於開放殖民地，日木之主張始終一貫。</p>
<p>此次演說後，經過六年，至一九四三年，大東亞各地殖民地次第宣告獨立解放，大東亞宣言在民族進展上實一劃時代的世紀，大東亞殖民問題漸告解決，常爲戰爭原因之殖民地問題，已告消減。</p>
<p>堅持理想粉碎暴力</p>
<p>然英美企岡將現在已完成獨立之各國家，再用武力使其淪爲殖民地地位，彼等口頭提倡自由領導後進國家，但實際上則剝奪他國自由獨立，榨取利益。此次戰爭爲何而起？吾人爲解放殖民地而戰於太平洋，英美則爲使展放之殖民地再倫爲殖民地而戰，理想勝，抑暴力勝？吾人深信必能粉碎敵人暴力，堅守吾人之理想，此爲唯一使命，亦大意也。（完）</p>

<h3>介紹南市平民醫院</h3>
<p>— 熙</p>
<p>「南市平民醫院」，顧名思義，就可知道它的地點與特質，其實這醫院是緊接市區的，它在民國路七七五號，靠近鄭家木橋，該院房產從前是同義善會大厦，曾一度作爲「綠寶賭塲」，交通很是便利。它不僅是目前南市規模最大設備最完善的醫院，也是黃浦區東南角唯一的大醫院，可惜不大被人們知道罷了！</p>
<h3>創立經過</h3>
<p>該院創自民國三十二年春末，當時一般熱心人士鑒於南市受戰爭之毀損尚末復原，一切設施多因陋就簡，蝸居是區者大都爲經濟力薄弱之人士，而物價日高，一般平民益復難勝醫藥之負擔，故每至炎夏，疫　滋生，即束手無策，乃有創立南市時疫醫院之舉，以補該區醫院之不足。該院初設肇嘉路儀鳳弄三樂應，佈置粗就，即行施診給樂，自夏而秋冬，救活平民達五六千人，嗣以知者日多，病人益衆，院址不敷，且因該區缼少設備完全之醫院，經該院董事會議決擴充爲平民醫院。</p>
<p>於三十四年一月遷入新址以後，即改裝屋宇，全院有房屋八十餘間，空氣流通，光綫充足，頗合醫療之用。董事長爲王永康，院長爲金學高，有醫師十人，護士十六人，練習生六人，院役十二人，醫務部主任爲鄭偉如，其下分：內科·兒科·外科·肺癆科·婦產科·皮花科·眼科·戒烟科·耳鼻喉科·理療·調劑科（雙劑配方）等。總務部主任爲徐渭漁其下分：文書科·事務拉·會計科等。</p>
<h3>設備齊全</h3>
<p>擴充後之病室有四十餘間，計病牀一百二十餘張，並添聘各科專門醫師，且以專家主持，添請護士，購置X光機器，增闢開刀室，亟置有最新式德國貨之手術台，電力·電氣止體器等，其化騐室亦備有極精密之儀器，關於醫院之重要設備，幾應有盡有，實較市區之小型醫院完善多多。</p>
<h3>免費診治</h3>
<p>該院上午九時至十一時半完全免費爲平民醫病，下午二時至五時略收號金，初診一百元，覆診五十元，急診二百元，應診四百元。其病房供膳頭等每日二飯一粥，甲種二千四百元，乙種二千二百元，二等每日二飯一粥一千八百元，三等二粥一飯每日一千元，生產住院一星期醫藥，手術費及房飯食在內共收一萬元。經濟情形困難者，皆可請求免費醫療。故每月支出約四百萬元，以收入相低不敷極钜。盼望各界人士踴躍損款，以便擴充平民醫療基金。</p>

<h3>足球丙組聯賽重決旋廻戰華倫　今晨十時半在膠州公園</h3>
<p>足球聯賽丙組，旋迴對華倫總決賽，上週末一度在膠園展開鬥爭，結果一比一握手言和，而於延長時間內，又各無所獲。現決定於今日上午十時半在膠園重行決奪。查旋迴麾下，泰半以去屆甲組三省人馬爲班底，故戰門力頗爲堅挺，而該隊指導王神父，鑒於上週戰成和局，對於調處陣容，未合理想，故決將麥爾森調回恢復中堅要職，前鋒綫上由顧以撤統率三軍，龐盤芳出任右補，屆時必能克故致果。華倫實力，亦相當精銳，兩組相遇，精彩可期。</p>
<p>旋迴　高致文·汪國光·莊文權·徐國福·麥爾森·曾士傑·陣宇偉·徐德明·顧以撤·龐盤芳·鄭思民。</p>
<p>華倫　顧彪·王春江·文玉麟·安迪生·郎少山·沈龍璋·顧銓泉·劉祖儒·胡斌·林家琤·徐煥明。</p>

<h3>The Third Grand Review of Youth, Chairman Chen Personally Gives Admonition, Thousands of Chinese and Japanese Representatives Display Vigorous Spirit</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency) – The third National Youth Grand Review was solemnly held at the Youth Hall parade ground at 9:00 AM on the 5th, which was Youth Day of the Republic of China. A grand reviewing stand was erected in the center, with a huge portrait of the Founding Father and the national flags of China and Japan hanging above it. The stand's front was filled with third Grand Review emblems and small flags, fluttering in the wind with a vigorous spirit. Starting at 8:00 AM, over three thousand people, including representative teams from various provinces and cities, military training students from Beijing, youth league members, and Japanese youth representatives, entered the field in an orderly fashion and stood in formation.

Acting Chairman Chen personally inspected the review and delivered an admonition. At precisely 9:00 AM, the military band played, respectfully welcoming Acting Chairman Chen. Guided by an usher, all the reviewing officers ascended the platform, marking the beginning of the grand review. After the general commander reported the number of people being reviewed, Acting Chairman Chen and other reviewing officers and guests toured the field for a week. This was followed by a march-past, with each team marching forward in an orderly manner. The order of the procession was led by the Chinese representative team, followed by the Japanese representative team, the Beijing military training student youth band, youth teams from various schools, students from agricultural training institutes, and representative teams from various provinces and cities, including North China, Zhejiang, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Huaihai, Anhui, and Northern Jiangsu. The entire group marched in synchronized steps with high spirits. After the march-past, Chinese youth representatives respectfully presented a flag to Acting Chairman Chen as a tribute. The flag was embroidered with the six characters "Long Live the Supreme Commander." Chairman Lin received the flag and presented it to Acting Chairman Chen, who then delivered a sincere admonition to everyone. His words were full of encouragement, deeply moving all who listened. Finally, the entire group sang the Youth League song and shouted national slogans, concluding the ceremony at around 11:00 AM.</p>
<h3>Love and Respect Each Other, Build a New East Asia, The Original Text of Acting Chairman Chen's Admonition</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency) – The original text of Acting Chairman Chen's admonition at the Third National Youth League Grand Review is as follows: Today is the 34th Youth Day, and we are also holding the Third National Youth League Grand Review. Thousands of energetic youth representatives from all over the country are gathered on this square, and we are also honored to have youth representatives from our allied nation, Japan, participating. This fully demonstrates the organization and strength of Chinese youth in China. I am extremely gratified. In the history of the Chinese revolution, youth have left behind brilliant achievements. Now, in the process of the revolution, we are encountering unprecedented difficulties. The fate of the motherland hangs by a thread. To overcome these difficulties, rescue and revitalize the motherland, and ultimately liberate and stabilize East Asia, we must have the sincere unity of the entire nation, dedicating all our manpower and resources to the country. Youth are the backbone of society, and they must first practice the work of revitalizing China and protecting Asia, leading the people in practicing the work of revitalizing China and protecting Asia. Recently, the national movement to advocate for unity and national salvation has been vigorously developing. The youth's movement for unity and national salvation is also vigorously developing. All youth across the country, whether in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, Zhili, Hebei, Gansu, or Shaanxi, are all compatriots of the Republic of China, all descendants of the Yellow Emperor, and all love their motherland. Only the communists betray the country, kill compatriots, deceive the people into deep suffering, and implement red policies. We must launch a struggle against communism and rescue the youth and compatriots under the tyranny of the communists. The late Chairman Wang advocated for the New National Movement and considered the youth movement as the focus of the New Movement's work, organizing and training the nation's citizens and youth to complete the great cause of the national revolution under the banner of the Three Principles of the People. Since the passing of the late Chairman Wang last year, the international situation has been so treacherous, and the domestic situation has been so chaotic. I hope that the nation's youth will stand firm in their positions, train themselves more, enrich themselves, understand the importance of their responsibilities, strengthen their organizations, and fulfill the legacy of the Founding Father and the late Chairman Wang, building a bright and brilliant Republic of China. I further hope that the youth of China and Japan, and the youth of all parts of East Asia, will love each other, respect and understand each other, and work together to build a free and liberated New East Asia.</p>

<h3>Chongqing Kuomintang Convenes the Sixth National Congress</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report – According to information from Chongqing, the Chongqing Kuomintang convened its Sixth National Congress on May 5th. The main agenda of this congress is to decide on the convocation of the National Assembly on November 12th of this year and to approve the draft constitution.</p>
<h3>Sketch of Prime Minister Suzuki</h3>
<p>When the important task of forming a cabinet fell to General Kantaro Suzuki, he was burdened with the heavy responsibility of the Privy Council President. At the time, there was a real lack of respect, with some people expressing uneasy voices saying, "Is he still standing at the forefront of the nation with his seventy-nine-year-old body?" No one but a man of utmost sincerity and dedication could shoulder the burden of Japan's current predicament. Only when the Japanese people realized that General Suzuki was such a person did they feel relieved. The old prime minister, General Kantaro Suzuki, shouldering the burden of the Japanese situation, how has he been striving since forming the cabinet? What supports him is the heartfelt support of Japan's 100 million people who want to lead this war to victory, the seventy-nine-year-old General Kantaro Suzuki.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister's Style</p>
<p>Anyone who has met General Kantaro Suzuki will feel that he is not a politician for the masses. He is neither so-called "of the masses" nor a "politician," but a true general. What is most endearing about him since taking office as prime minister is this point. In the past, there was no opportunity to connect with the public, so how to touch the hearts of the people and how to grasp the voices of the people after taking office as prime minister has become a point of deep contemplation for Prime Minister Suzuki. This is what people close to Mr. Suzuki say. Prime Minister Suzuki is quite willing to listen frankly to the opinions and requests of the people. Since forming the cabinet, Prime Minister Suzuki has been quietly and steadily moving forward.</p>
<p>The first time General Suzuki appeared on the streets after becoming prime minister was to inspect the disaster area of ​​Tokyo on April 15. At that time, he only brought a secretary. During the air raid on the night of April 13, the area near the prime minister's private residence in Koishikawa was turned into a sea of ​​fire. Thanks to the resolute firefighting activities of people who admired the prime minister and police officers, the prime minister's residence and its surrounding area were preserved in the vast fire zone, but it was once extremely dangerous. At that time, General Suzuki was in an open space in Otsuka, mixed in with a group of citizens of the capital, encouraging each other and sheltering in air-raid shelters. At this time, incendiary bombs were falling like rain, and no one knew that the old man was the prime minister, until a teacher from a national school shouted: "Ah, isn't that Mr. Suzuki!" Everyone then recognized him.</p>
<p>That night, Prime Minister Suzuki certainly did not sleep all night, but at 4:30 AM on the 14th, he went to the official residence as usual to work, and he was even busier than usual. The broadcast that night was also Prime Minister's own idea. After the broadcast, he felt that it was not enough, so there was the tour of the disaster area the next day. When leaving the official residence, the Prime Minister said: "I really want to send some gifts to the disaster victims!" But the prime minister's family, who usually lives a very frugal life, could not find any suitable items for a while. "Then send them my snacks and try to comfort the disaster victims?"</p>
<p>Secretaries' Meeting</p>
<p>A meeting that demonstrates the Prime Minister's hope to implement politics that are close to the hearts of the people is a meeting that the Prime Minister must have with secretaries Suzuki I., Suzuki T., and Nishimura Naomi every night from 9:00 PM. Before General Suzuki became prime minister, as long as there was nothing special, anyone who wanted to meet him could quickly get an opportunity to meet; this was the custom of General Suzuki's family. After becoming prime minister, General Suzuki said to his secretaries:</p>
<p>"I want to meet anyone and listen to anyone's words."</p>
<p>However, the Prime Minister certainly has no reason to receive everyone, so sometimes the secretaries receive them on his behalf. These three secretaries report everything they have seen and heard during the day to the old prime minister every night, no matter how big or small. Since the Suzuki Cabinet was formed, the number of letters and petitions sent to the Prime Minister's official residence has been no less than hundreds every day. The Prime Minister naturally does not have so much leisure time to read their contents one by one, and the secretaries open them and relay them. Therefore, the meeting every night always lasts more than an hour.</p>
<p>Determination to Win</p>
<p>Getting up at 5:00 AM and going to bed at 10:00 PM is General Suzuki's daily routine, but since becoming prime minister, this routine has been broken. The first statement at the inauguration: "I am willing to bury my old body in the front ranks of the people!" This is by no means a rhetorical phrase. The spirit of staying up all night for two or three days seems to have driven away the age of seventy-nine. Although people close to him advise him "not to overwork," the prime minister is still full of energy and does not take it seriously. According to one of his close aides, that kind of advice would tarnish the prime minister's determination to die.</p>
<p>Being inherently sincere, serving the public with sincerity, believing in the victory of the Greater East Asia War, comforting the people from time to time, and inspiring the people from time to time, is this old prime minister, Suzuki! (Translated from the Asahi Shimbun, April 21)</p>
<p>Weekly Commentary</p>
<h3>Commentary on the Chongqing Sixth National Congress</h3>
<p>— Zhu Kejia</p>
<p>The Chongqing Kuomintang convened its Sixth National Congress starting (May 5), seemingly focusing on discussing the political outline after the end of the war. Judging from the information available here, the main agenda will focus on: 1. Concrete issues of convening the National Assembly; 2. Final decision on the May 5th Constitution; 3. Amendment of the Kuomintang's political program. From the perspective of the Kuomintang's fifty years of arduous struggle, apart from the First National Congress in 1924 under the personal leadership of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, this "Sixth National Congress" is more significant, because the above three issues to be discussed have objectively important relationships in various aspects, both internal and external. However, this is an observation based on the program posted on the stage. In reality, the play is still a play. But after watching so many similar continuous dramas, no matter how wonderful the performance on stage and how thunderous the applause from the audience, what effective results have they had for the interests of the country and the nation? Today, the common people have lost their charm for any good play. What they expect is not the beautiful singing, but the practice of saving the lifeblood of the country!</p>
<p>As for the issue of practice, there is no need to mention the old events that have disappointed the Chinese people in the past. Take today's theme of the Chongqing "Sixth National Congress": convening the National Assembly has been the common hope of the people for twenty years, but all they have gotten is listening to party members reciting the moving words in the Premier's will and the repeated breaches of trust by the authorities. Now, even if it is decided to hold it, how will the people elect truly representative representatives? How will the representatives exercise their powers to formulate the basic law of the country? The Chongqing Kuomintang political machine obviously has no satisfactory answer. As the Chongqing China Democratic Political League's declaration (January 30 of this year) said: "If only a part of the representatives elected in the 25th and 26th years are selected, and a number of representatives are assigned from some provinces where elections are impossible, in order to meet the quota of 1,440, and then several hundred Kuomintang Central Committee members and alternate Central Committee members are added as ex officio members, and a constitution that the whole country should abide by is to be formulated with this, and it is still said that it is returned to the people, and it is intended to achieve the national unity, we believe that the result will be counterproductive." In fact, how can the people in the Democratic Political League not know the intentions of the Chongqing authorities? In reality, the Chinese people all long for the early convening of a true National Congress of National Representatives to discuss national affairs and implement constitutional government, but it will only be possible after the national peace and unity is achieved. Otherwise, even if it is achieved, it will only be the opinions of a part of the people in less than one-third of the country, which will not be able to solve the overall national affairs in the future and will only increase future divisions.</p>
<p>Objectively speaking, the Chongqing "Sixth National Congress" has failed to eliminate the selfishness of individuals and factions, so it has failed to gain the support and trust of the people. This is an expected thing. We must solemnly point out: "When the Great Way is practiced, the world is for all." Now, the Chongqing Kuomintang's Sixth National Congress only knows how to create clever names, but in reality, it maintains and expands the rights of individuals and private parties, so it will naturally not have any effective prospects. However, looking at the overall situation, the consequences are extremely serious. If the Chinese people do not quickly plan for national peace and unity, then internal wars and external troubles, and endless wars will connect, and the Chinese nation's sinking will be fearful. I deeply hope that the whole country, from top to bottom, will quickly and fiercely wake up! Be practical, unite and unite, and strive for survival for China and East Asia.</p>

<h3>Dönitz Encourages German Troops to Continue Anti-Soviet Resistance; Western Isolated Troops Surrender to Britain and America</h3>
<p>Stockholm, May 5th, Central News Agency Dispatch - According to a German radio report: German new head of state General Dönitz broadcasted to the German troops in central, southern, and southeastern Germany today as follows: "The only purpose for which the German troops must continue to fight is to rescue the German people from 'Bolshevization' and 'enslavement'. This is your most sacred task. This task will certainly be realized in the future in the spirit of the former head of state and in the spirit of defending the nation. However, anyone who plans for his own survival alone will not only fail to save the entire society but will also be a public enemy of the German people, and we must deal with them in the same way. Unconditional obedience, iron discipline, and cooperation in all aspects should be emphasized now more than ever before. Furthermore, the isolated German troops in the north, west, and south have laid down their arms after glorious struggles, but further fighting against the Western powers has become meaningless."</p>
<p>Stockholm, May 5th, Central News Agency Dispatch - According to news from London: It is widely believed that the German government under the leadership of Admiral Dönitz has moved to Norway. It is reported that the new German head of state discussed with the German administrative officials stationed in Denmark and Norway yesterday.</p>
<p>Stockholm, May 5th, Central News Agency Dispatch - According to the London Observer: The German troops in the Netherlands, northwestern Germany, and Denmark have surrendered to General Montgomery. This, combined with the surrender of the German troops in Italy and western Austria to Marshal Alexander, has created a situation in which there will be no more German resistance to the Western Allied forces. In theory, the German naval, land, and air forces in Norway and the German troops in various ports in France and the Aegean Sea can continue to resist, but the German troops are now only resisting the enemy coming from the east.</p>
<p>Stockholm, May 5th, Central News Agency Dispatch - According to a Danish broadcast of a German Supreme Headquarters communiqué on the 4th: After fierce fighting, the German troops in the Mecklenburg region entered the Allied-occupied zone on the west bank of the Elbe River and laid down their arms and surrendered.</p>
<h3>Eisenhower Declares Thorough Destruction of German Troops</h3>
<p>Zurich, May 5th, Central News Agency Dispatch - Eisenhower declared on the 4th: "We will thoroughly destroy the German troops on land, at sea, and in the air. Those who are now requesting surrender are only the defeated German troops."</p>
<h3>Churchill Remains in London Awaiting Developments</h3>
<p>Stockholm, May 5th, Central News Agency Dispatch - Rumors of Germany's surrender are spreading all over Europe. The London radio station describes it with the phrase "imminent." British Prime Minister Churchill will personally announce this news to the British people. He remained at his official residence on Downing Street today and attended Parliament for only two minutes. A loudspeaker has been placed in his office, ready to announce to Parliament when the surrender news arrives. Since the initial news of Himmler's peace negotiations from San Francisco, reports of collective or individual surrenders have been coming from neutral countries and from the battlefields every minute, but the news that Marshal Montgomery is directly negotiating surrender with the new German head of state has not yet been confirmed. However, the situation is extremely fluid, and anything is possible. The individual surrenders of German troops show that the German troops only want to continue resisting for a few days, but there is still reason to believe that the war may not end immediately, because there are still hundreds of German submarines operating overseas, and the Allies must wait for them all to return to show their sincerity. However, the fact that the Ministry of Domestic Security has issued instructions to prepare for celebrating Victory Day is an indication that the Allies cannot wait too long.</p>
<h3>1.5 Million German Troops in Encirclement Pockets Continue to Resist</h3>
<p>Stockholm, May 5th, Central News Agency Dispatch - While the British, American, and Soviet armies are sweeping away the remaining resistance strongholds of the German troops with large forces, offices all over the world are spreading rumors that Germany is about to surrender. Various parties are making strong inferences about the possibility that the Allies will issue a final surrender ultimatum, which will make the Germans who continue to resist unprotected by law. Just as important as crossing the Kiel Canal is the problem of how to deal with the 500,000 German troops who have surrendered since the Allies broke through the Elbe River bridgehead, which the British army is finding difficult.</p>
<p>According to Allied observers, there are approximately 1.5 million German troops in various encirclement pockets in various parts of Europe who continue to resist. The main areas are listed below: The German 20th Army, commanded by General Boehme, has approximately 150,000 to 300,000 troops, possessing 300 submarines and a small number of aircraft in Norway. In Czechoslovakia, eastern Austria, northwestern Yugoslavia, and a small part of Bavaria, part of the 8th Army, commanded by General Höhne, is still fighting in the Czech Republic. The remnants of the 1st and 19th Armies, commanded by Field Marshal Kesselring, and a small number of stormtroopers in eastern Austria and Bavaria, as well as parts of the German 6th and 8th Armies and the remnants of the 2nd and 6th Panzer Armies, may still be in the area. There may still be six to ten divisions of troops in Yugoslavia, with a considerable strength of approximately 350,000 troops in this pocket. The 25th Army, commanded by General Christiansen in western Netherlands, has approximately 100,000 troops. In the area of 5,000 square kilometers around Liepāja in Latvia, approximately 15 to 30 divisions of German troops continue to resist. In the northern pocket, several divisions of German troops between the Elbe and Ems rivers are defending Emden and Wilhelmshaven.

There are still thousands of German troops on the Hel Peninsula.</p>
<h3>Voting Issues at the San Francisco Conference</h3>
<p>Disagreement Between the United States and the Soviet Union</p>
<p>Lisbon, May 4th, Central News Agency Dispatch - According to a San Francisco dispatch: The Byelorussian issue seems to be a difficulty at the San Francisco Conference, and now the United States and the Soviet Union disagree on the voting issue. The United States advocates a majority voting system, while the Soviet Union advocates an absolute majority system of more than two-thirds. As a result of inviting Byelorussia, Ukraine, and Argentina to participate, the total number of participating countries is now 49. If the United States' proposal is adopted, the conference can pass a resolution with the approval of 25 votes. If the Soviet Union's proposal is adopted, at least 33 votes are required. The reason why the United States advocates majority rule is that the 21 countries in the Americas, plus the American puppet states of Liberia and the Philippines, total 23 countries. Therefore, if it obtains the support of two more countries, the United States can arbitrarily control the conference. However, the Soviet Union thoroughly advocates a two-thirds majority, and its attitude is quite firm.</p>
<h3>Colonial Issues and Japan's Stance</h3>
<p>Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy</p>
<p>— Director of Information Matsudaira</p>
<p>Chinese and Japanese Nations Struggle for Independence</p>
<p>European countries have successively seized colonies in the Americas, Africa, India, Australia, and the South Seas. Any gap in areas outside Europe is immediately exploited by them. Later, they extended their reach to Japan and China, demanding the opening of commercial ports for trade and facilitating Christian missionary work. Through various methods, they gradually eroded the independence of East Asian countries, leading to the gradual decline or control by others, groaning under the domination and exploitation of imperialist countries. More than half of the East Asian nations are in this state. Only Japan, China, and Thailand勉强maintain the nominal status of independence, but as early as a century ago, they had become semi-independent, with the potential of becoming colonies. Japan was the first to awaken and strive for complete independence, and China also launched the National Revolution to seek complete independence. Thailand is also actively working towards this goal.</p>
<p>Britain and America Adopt Malicious Policies</p>
<p>When the Anglo-Saxons crossed over to the Americas, how did they treat the Native Americans? And how did they treat the indigenous people of Australia? The Anglo-Saxons adopted a malicious policy of never compromising with the indigenous people, killing them all. We only need to read the history of Anglo-Saxon development in the Americas and Australia to understand that their methods are selfish and inhumane. The Latin nations' method of developing South America is to adopt a compromising approach, taking into account the interests of the indigenous people, or intermarrying and integrating cultures. The Anglo-Saxons are different, they are the most terrifying nation in the world. Not only do they not allow each nation to find its place, but they also seize it by force. This behavior is the main cause of war. In other words, the real cause of war lies in the fact that countries such as Britain, America, France, and the Netherlands possess vast and fertile territories and colonies that exceed their population proportions and are not open to others. For example, Britain has the largest colonies, and on average, each Briton can control 17 people of different ethnicities. This unreasonable state is the cause of war.</p>
<p>Colonial Resource Allocation Issues</p>
<p>Twelve or thirteen years ago, scholars around the world advocated that in order to avoid war, the distribution of colonies must be adjusted. In September 1935, American Major Howe discussed this issue, and his proposal to redistribute colonial resources attracted attention from various countries. On October 17th of the following year, the International Labor Organization passed a resolution to establish a committee on raw material resources. Although Japan had already withdrawn from the League of Nations at that time, it was still invited to join, and Commercial Secretary Shuto of the embassy in Germany represented Japan in the committee. At the meeting on March 8th, 1937, the British representative Lister proposed the following: Oppose the redistribution of territory, oppose opening the doors of colonies. The economic relationship between old colonies and their home countries is inseparable, and opening colonies often hinders their development and harms the well-being of residents. It is extremely difficult to obtain raw materials. Secretary Shuto, following instructions from the Japanese government, advocated: 1. Labor, technology, and capital can freely enter all lands, 2. Abolish restrictions on the export of raw material resources by various countries, 3. Eliminate trade barriers, and apply the Congo Basin Treaty regarding the opening of colonies to all colonies worldwide. He clarified the proposal for opening colonies. However, the initiator of the meeting, Britain, avoided solving important issues, and representatives from the Union of South Africa, the Netherlands, Canada, and France all supported Britain's proposal, leading to the complete failure of the meeting. Japan's proposal was not only the proposal of Mr. Shuto at that meeting. In January 1936, when the Japanese opened the 68th session of the Diet, Foreign Minister Hirota also advocated free trade, open doors, freedom of communication, and equal access to resources in his speech. The following year, in Foreign Minister Arita's speech on diplomatic policy in the Diet, he further clarified the Japanese government's specific policies for opening colonies, advocating that the Congo Basin Treaty be applied to all colonies worldwide. Regarding the opening of colonies, Japan's proposal has always been consistent.</p>
<p>Six years after this speech, in 1943, colonies in various parts of the Greater East Asia were successively declared independent and liberated. The Greater East Asia Declaration is an epoch-making milestone in national progress, and the colonial issue in Greater East Asia has gradually been resolved. The colonial issue, which has often been the cause of war, has been reduced.</p>
<p>Adhere to Ideals and Shatter Violence</p>
<p>However, Britain and America are attempting to use force to turn the now independent countries back into colonies. They verbally advocate freedom and lead backward countries, but in reality, they deprive other countries of freedom and independence and exploit their interests. Why did this war start? We are fighting in the Pacific to liberate colonies, while Britain and America are fighting to make the liberated colonies become colonies again. Will ideals prevail, or will violence prevail? We firmly believe that we will be able to shatter the enemy's violence and adhere to our ideals. This is our only mission and great intention. (End)</p>

<h3>Central Reserve Bank to Issue Gold Certificates Starting Tomorrow to Tighten Currency and Suppress Prices</h3>
<p>In order to tighten currency, suppress prices, stabilize people's livelihoods, and increase combat power, the National Government's Ministry of Finance has specially approved the Central Reserve Bank to issue gold certificates. These gold certificates are denominated in one tael, five taels, and ten taels. They are scheduled to be issued starting tomorrow (the 7th). At the same time, a Gold Certificate Issuance Reserve Management Committee will be established to be responsible for managing the gold that backs the issuance of gold certificates. Minister of Finance Zhou specially issued a statement, and Vice President Qian of the Central Reserve Bank also met with reporters from the Sino-Japanese News at 3:00 p.m. yesterday (the 5th) to clarify the significance of issuing gold certificates. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Minister of Finance Zhou Issues Statement</h3>
<p>Minister of Finance Zhou Fohai issued a special statement regarding the issuance of gold certificates, saying: "The government, in view of the recent price and currency situation, believes that tightening currency and suppressing prices are indispensable tasks for stabilizing people's livelihoods and increasing combat power. Therefore, it has decided to order the Central Reserve Bank to issue gold certificates. This is a suitable and effective method for the recovery and tightening of currency. Gold certificates are certificates that are periodically redeemable for gold. They have sufficient gold reserves, and influential figures from the government and the public have been recruited to form the Gold Certificate Reserve Management Committee, which is specifically responsible for the issuance of certificates and the management of gold reserves, to guarantee the redemption of gold certificates upon maturity. It is very easy for people to purchase gold certificates, which is more convenient than purchasing cash and can avoid the danger of hoarding. These gold certificates can also be freely traded, providing the public with a good and secure investment channel. The main purpose of issuing gold certificates is to recover and tighten currency. Therefore, the value of the Central Reserve Bank notes will naturally become more stable. However, there will be no changes to the currency system. Therefore, this measure is definitely not creating a new currency, nor is it to link the Central Reserve Bank notes to gold. It is hoped that the public will understand this purpose and actively subscribe to help achieve its success."</p>
<h3>Preparation Committee Officially Established</h3>
<p>In order to manage the gold reserves for the issuance of gold certificates, the Central Reserve Bank has specially established a Gold Certificate Issuance Reserve Management Committee within the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank. Zhou Fohai, President of the Central Reserve Bank, will serve as the Chairman of the Committee, and Qian Daqu, Vice President, will serve as the Vice Chairman. Shao Hongzhu, Director of the Issuance Bureau, Liu Ruxiang, Director of the Business Bureau, and Yuan Fudeng, Chairman of the Shanghai Special City Chamber of Commerce, Wu Zhenxiu, Chairman of the Bank of China, Tang Shoumin, Chairman of the Bank of Communications, Ye Fuxiao, Chairman of the City Bankers' Association, Zhu Boquan, Chairman of the Bank Union Reserve Committee, and Pei Yunqing, Chairman of the City Money Trade Association, have been appointed as members. The establishment ceremony was held at 10:00 a.m. yesterday (the 5th) at the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank.</p>
<h3>Measures for Issuing and Redeeming Gold Certificates</h3>
<p>Measures for the Central Reserve Bank to issue and redeem gold certificates:</p>
<p>(1) This bank is specially authorized by the Ministry of Finance to issue gold certificates, divided into three types: one tael certificates, five tael certificates, and ten tael certificates.</p>
<p>(2) Gold certificates are redeemed for gold on a specified date based on the certificate, recognizing the certificate but not the person.</p>
<p>(3) The issuance date of the gold certificates will be determined and announced by this bank at any time with reference to market conditions.</p>
<p>(4) The sale price and redemption date of the gold certificates will be announced by this bank at the time of issuance.</p>
<p>(5) The sale of gold certificates is based on the principle of collecting cash, but checks or bank notes paid by this bank may also be collected.</p>
<p>(6) Gold certificates may be redeemed for gold bars, but when the weight of the gold bars differs from the face value of the certificate, the difference should be calculated and collected according to the sale price of the gold certificates.</p>
<p>(7) These rules will be implemented after approval, and the same applies to amendments.</p>
<h3>Celebrating Youth Day, Holding a Joint Gathering, Attended by More Than a Thousand Youth Representatives</h3>
<p>In order to celebrate the "May 5th" Youth Day, the city youth league headquarters sent representatives to Beijing to participate in the national youth league member review. In addition, at 9:00 a.m. on the 5th, a youth gathering was held at the Great Light Theater. Gu, the secretary-general of the New Life Movement Shanghai Branch, represented Secretary Li Liuxiao, as well as Yuan Weicun, Shen Zhaofeng, and responsible officials from each district league headquarters, all came to guide the meeting. More than a thousand professional youth students and youth league members attended the meeting. First, Secretary Li gave a speech, elaborating on the meaning of Youth Day and the responsibilities of young people. Then, the Youth Song was sung, and Shen Zhaofeng led the entire group in shouting national slogans, and the music was played to complete the ceremony. Finally, a Youth Theater Troupe performed "Soul of the Party Member," and the meeting ended at 12:00 noon.</p>
<p>In addition, four schools in Zhabei, including the Qunyi, Laian, and Huguang Municipal Elementary Schools, jointly held a joint review at the Zhabei Elementary School playground at 10:00 a.m., with Shi Yun, the principal of Zhabei Elementary School, serving as the reviewing officer. More than 300 young people participated.</p>
<h3>Director of Information Idebuchi Expresses Thoughts on Youth Day</h3>
<p>The information department of the Japanese Army in Shanghai held a regular press conference at 11:30 a.m. on the 5th, as usual. Director Idebuchi arrived on time with Lieutenant Nakagawa, and Director Idebuchi explained the recent war situation on the spot. He also expressed his thoughts on Youth Day for Chinese Youth in the East Asian region as follows: "Youth is the driving force of the country, and its thinking and ability to act contribute greatly to the country and nation. Youth in all countries tend to be the same. Especially in times of national emergency, every country relies more on youth. Japanese youth go to the front lines to serve in the army, and others actively engage in production at home. Therefore, Japanese youth are working hard in every job, just like in China and East Asia. In short, any country takes youth as the center." Finally, Director Idebuchi raised his glass to wish all the youths of the Greater East Asia nations happiness without end, and the meeting ended at 1:30 p.m.</p>
<h3>Citizens Returning to Their Hometowns Should Process Household Registration Changes</h3>
<p>Many residents of Shanghai who have returned to their hometowns have not processed household registration changes and have simply taken their residence permits with them, resulting in a chaotic household registration situation that is prone to corruption. The root cause is that the processing is slow and the application procedures are difficult, so people regard reporting changes as a daunting task. If transportation is convenient, they simply depart without legally processing the change procedures. Household registration and other matters are the basic requirements of government administration. At this time when Shanghai is evacuating its population, the application for changes by idle residents must be simplified as much as possible and processed immediately upon arrival, without delays. The Municipal Government has issued orders to each sub-bureau and Baojia office, instructing each district Baojia general office to comply. It is hoped that citizens who move will be sure to process the declaration according to the procedures and not take their residence permits back to their hometowns to prevent abuses.</p>
<h3>Strict Enforcement of Vehicle Lighting and Sound Control by the Police Bureau; Air Defense Headquarters Inspects All Vehicles in the City</h3>
<p>Due to repeated enemy air raids on Shanghai, the Municipal Police Bureau is strengthening its air defense tasks, especially strictly enforcing lighting control. In addition to indoor lighting control, it is also paying attention to vehicle lighting and has ordered each sub-bureau to strictly enforce it. All vehicles must be equipped with air defense lights in accordance with the regulations of the military and police authorities, and sound control must also be strictly observed. Violators will be arrested, the vehicles will be taken to the bureau, and the owners will be required to improve the vehicle lights and be punished, in order to improve the city's lighting control. It is reported that the Lao Zha Sub-bureau mobilized all the police officers of the second team the night before to thoroughly enforce vehicle lighting control in the district, detaining more than 200 various vehicles in violation of regulations, and they were all punished according to law.</p>
<p>Also, it is reported that the Shanghai Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters is strengthening the implementation of air defense in view of the increasingly tense situation. In order to inspect the lighting and sound control of vehicles throughout the city, the chief of the air defense section, Yamamoto, the deputy chief, Li Zhenhuan, and Kobayashi of the transportation section have been taking turns inspecting designated locations in each district sub-bureau from 8:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. every day since the 3rd of this month. It is scheduled to end on the 8th. However, on the 17th Air Defense Day on the 9th, personnel from the Air Defense and Transportation Sections will conduct inspections throughout the district from 8:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. and from 10:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m.</p>
<h3>Yangtze River Sailing Transport to Expand Routes</h3>
<p>Since the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company added a sailing transport department in the middle of last month to manage the Yangtze River sailing vessel transportation on various lines, the business has been quite developed. It is now known that the company is actively planning to expand the sailing routes. It is reported that the direct sailing routes will include more than ten ports on the Yangtze River, including Renjiagang, Lao Honggang, Yaogang, Tianshenggang, Shierwei Port, New Port, Zhang Huanggang, Chongming, and Hai, with at least one round trip per week. It will greatly help smooth the transportation of materials.</p>
<h3>Silver and Money Industries Change Check Collection Time</h3>
<p>The banks and financial institutions in this city received a notice from the United Reserve Depository yesterday, regarding the change of time for the collection of negotiable instruments among the industry. It is stipulated that exchanges must be completed before 10:00 a.m. every day. Overdue transactions will be exchanged the following day. All banks and financial institutions have been implementing this change since yesterday morning (the 5th).</p>
<h3>19th Period Household Sugar; Deadline for Supplementary Issuance</h3>
<p>During the sale of the 19th period of household sugar, the sugar that retailers received less than the sugar tickets was supplemented by the Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office. The office announced that retailers should issue sugar based on receipts from the 6th to the 10th of this month, and supplementary issues will not be made after the deadline. All citizens who submitted the Y-ticket of the 44th General Ration Certificate to the retailer during the sugar sale period and obtained the store's receipt must take the sugar based on the store's receipt within the deadline, and do not delay themselves.</p>
<h3>Seventeenth Air Defense Day: Training Alert Time - Sirens Will Not Sound Except for Actual Alerts</h3>
<p>The ninth of this month is the seventeenth Air Defense Day. The Civil Air Defense Headquarters of the city will, as usual, launch air defense drills in various districts of the city. This training includes controls on lighting, traffic, and sound. However, on this training day, the sirens will not sound. The time of issuance and cancellation of alerts will be published in advance in various newspapers and broadcast on the radio. If an actual alert is issued during the training alert on this day, the prescribed sirens will still be sounded. A partial drill will be held on this day within the jurisdiction of the Jing'an Temple, Jiangning Road, and Putuo Road Third Police Precincts.

<h3>Ministry of Finance Announces: Gold Certificate Issuance Outline</h3>

<h3>Introducing the Nanshi People's Hospital</h3>
<p>— Xi</p>
<p>The "Nanshi People's Hospital," as the name suggests, reveals its location and characteristics. In fact, this hospital is located close to the city center at 775 Minquan Road, near Zhengjia Wood Bridge. The property of the hospital was formerly the Tongyi Benevolent Association Building, which was once used as the "Green Treasure Gambling Hall." Transportation is very convenient. It is not only the largest and most well-equipped hospital in Nanshi at present, but also the only large hospital in the southeast corner of Huangpu District. It is a pity that it is not well-known.</p>
<h3>Establishment Process</h3>
<p>The hospital was founded in the late spring of the thirty-second year of the Republic [1943]. At that time, public-spirited individuals recognized that Nanshi had not yet recovered from the devastation of the war, and all facilities were mostly rudimentary. The residents of the area were mostly people with weak financial resources, and with the rising prices, ordinary people found it increasingly difficult to bear the burden of medical expenses. Therefore, every summer, epidemics bred, and they were helpless. Thus, the establishment of the Nanshi Epidemic Hospital was proposed to supplement the shortage of hospitals in the area. The hospital was initially set up at Sanle Ying, Yifeng Lane, Zhaojia Road. The layout was roughly arranged, and diagnosis and treatment were immediately provided. From summer to autumn and winter, it saved the lives of five to six thousand civilians. Later, as more people became aware of it and the number of patients increased, the hospital site was insufficient. Furthermore, due to the lack of a fully equipped hospital in the area, the hospital's board of directors resolved to expand it into a people's hospital.</p>
<p>After moving to the new site in January of the thirty-fourth year [1945], the buildings were renovated. The entire hospital has more than eighty rooms, with good air circulation and ample light, which is very suitable for medical use. The chairman of the board is Wang Yongkang, and the president of the hospital is Jin Xuegao. There are ten doctors, sixteen nurses, six interns, and twelve hospital staff. The director of the medical department is Zheng Weiru, under whom are divided: Internal Medicine, Pediatrics, Surgery, Tuberculosis, Obstetrics and Gynecology, Dermatology, Ophthalmology, Addiction Treatment, Otolaryngology, Physical Therapy, and Dispensing (double prescription) departments. The director of the general affairs department is Xu Weiyu, under whom are divided: Document Department, General Affairs Section, and Accounting Section.</p>
<h3>Complete Equipment</h3>
<p>The expanded hospital has more than forty wards, with a total of more than one hundred and twenty beds. Specialized doctors in various departments were also newly hired, with experts in charge. Nurses were added, X-ray machines were purchased, and a surgery room was newly opened, equipped with the latest German-made operating table, electric hemostatic device, etc. The laboratory is also equipped with extremely precise instruments. The important equipment of the hospital is almost all available, which is much more complete than the small hospitals in the city.</p>
<h3>Free Diagnosis and Treatment</h3>
<p>The hospital provides completely free medical treatment for civilians from 9:00 AM to 11:30 AM. From 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM, a small consultation fee is charged: 100 yuan for the first visit, 50 yuan for a follow-up visit, 200 yuan for an emergency visit, and 400 yuan for a house call. For ward meals, first-class is 2,400 yuan per day with two meals and one porridge, second-class is 2,200 yuan per day, second-class is 1,800 yuan per day with two meals and one porridge, and third-class is 1,000 yuan per day with two porridge and one meal. Delivery hospitalization for one week, including medical expenses, surgery fees, and room and board, costs 10,000 yuan. Those with difficult financial situations can request free medical treatment. Therefore, monthly expenses are about 4 million yuan, and the income is far from sufficient. We hope that people from all walks of life will actively donate funds to expand the people's medical fund.</p>

<h3>Soccer Third Division League: Re-Match Decides Championship - Xuan Hui vs. Warren, 10:30 AM This Morning at Jiaozhou Park</h3>
<p>In the final between Xuan Hui and Warren in the Third Division Soccer League, the struggle unfolded at Jiaozhou Park last weekend. The result was a 1-1 draw, and no goals were scored in extra time. It has now been decided to re-match at Jiaozhou Park at 10:30 AM this morning to determine the champion. Most of Xuan Hui's team is based on the players from the Third Provinces team from last year's First Division, so their combat strength is quite strong. The team's coach, Father Wang, considering the draw last week, was not satisfied with the adjustment of the lineup, so he decided to bring back Melson to resume the key position of center back. In the forward line, Gu Yi will lead the three armies, and Pang Panfang will serve as the right substitute. At that time, they will surely be able to overcome difficulties and achieve results. Warren's strength is also quite elite. When the two teams meet, an exciting match is expected.</p>
<p>Xuan Hui: Gao Zhiwen, Wang Guoguang, Zhuang Wenquan, Xu Guofu, Melson, Zeng Shijie, Zhen Yuwei, Xu Deming, Gu Yiche, Pang Panfang, Zheng Simin.</p>
<p>Warren: Gu Biao, Wang Chunjiang, Wen Yulin, Anderson, Lang Shaoshan, Shen Longzhang, Gu Quanquan, Liu Zuru, Hu Bin, Lin Jiacheng, Xu Huanming.</p>

<h3>Registration for Out-of-School Youth</h3>
<p>The Teacher Fellowship of the Chinese YMCA and YWCA, in view of the sharp increase in the number of out-of-school youth, is organizing a registration for these youths in order to assist and guide them in their studies. The registration period is from May 7th to the 21st, from 4:30 PM to 6:00 PM daily (except Sundays). Male and female students who have graduated from high school or are currently studying in high school can go to the YMCA at 638 Weihaiwei Road to complete the registration procedures.</p>
<h3>Poor Woman Searching for Daughter</h3>
<p>A woman named Zheng recently came to this office claiming that she lives at 30 Jiahe Lane, Changde Road (formerly Hart Road). Her husband has been missing for a long time. She is a single mother of a four-year-old daughter named Cui'e, who was wearing a towel shirt, had hair on her head, a fair face, round eyes, and was holding a lucky-shaped vegetable basket. She went missing on May 2nd at the entrance of the alley and could not be found after searching everywhere. It was heard that near the Chongsong Pharmacy opposite the Jimei Village on Jing'an Temple Road, she was taken away by a young man in a gray suit and a young woman in a striped cheongsam and wearing sunglasses, whose names are unknown. Before leaving, they declared to the public that they would send her to the radio station to search for her. Mrs. Zheng rushed to the scene after hearing the news, but it was too late. She then went to various radio stations to inquire, but there was no news. After losing her daughter, Mrs. Zheng spends her days and nights in tears, in unbearable pain. It is hoped that the young couple in the suit will quickly send the girl back to her address, so that the mother and daughter can reunite. The merit would be immeasurable.</p>
