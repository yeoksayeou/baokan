<h3>沖繩島南部全綫决鬥　戰局臨重大關頭　兩月來日軍收獲驚人戰果</h3>
<p>東京三日中央社電　冲繩烏南部地區之地上戰鬥，激烈已達極點，雙方絢傾其主力，巨全綫展開大決戰。敵於三十一日侵入日軍主要陣地之那覇市內及首里城址，更有一部敵軍由與那原附近繼續南下，進抵稻伏（與那原南方約三十公里），隨處與邀擊之日軍展開屍山血河之熾烈戰鬥。敵軍刻在第一綫傾注約七師之全部兵力，企圖强行突破日軍之中心防衛陣地，冲繩方面之戰况，已臨嚴重關頭。</p>
<p>東京三日中央社電　冲繩方面之敵軍，四月一日在本島登陸以來，迄今兩月餘，遭日軍空陸海三方面之特攻攻擊，致犧牲慘重，仍企圖由本島南下，欲突破日軍堅陣，但遭日軍之熾烈反擊。敵僅在本島南部地區之兵員損害，已超過五萬人。敵登陸總兵力八師中之四師，已完全喪失戰鬥之資格。又日航空部隊及特攻隊，對冲繩島北·中兩機塲及伊江島機塲，又冲繩島四周之敵艦船羣及蟠踞柬方海上之敵機動部隊，連續施行猛烈襲擊，迄今已擊沉擊毀包括空母，戰艦，輸送船等主力之敵戰鬥艦艇五百六十六艘。此外，連日炸燬敵機塲設施，使之起火，如是於日航空攻擊之猛攻前，敵爲挽回頹勢，乃動員英機動部隊，同時調用馬里亞納基地之B29型機，施行戰術轟炸，以策應艦載機作戰，歷時月餘，對九州方面之日航空基地施行直接攻擊。一方企圖摧破日方戰意及破壞生產交通，强化戰略轟炸，對東京·橫濱·大阪·神戶等重要都市盲目轟炸，如是冲繩本島之攻防戰日益激烈，今已達頂點，日方收獲戰果實堪驚人、但敵依然憑恃物　，不顧嚴重損耗與犧性，與日軍激戰到底，今冲繩戰局漸告緊迫。</p>
<h3>東亞各地一周戰況</h3>
<p>東京三日中央社電　東亞各地最近一周間戰况如次：</p>
<p>冲繩方面：冲繩本島南部地區繼續激戰，攻擊重點在東海岸，敵軍企圖直衝日軍側背部，逐次侵入與那原南方地區，首里與那　間之興儀，那　市等日軍陣地，兩軍展開決戰。日航空部隊具比呼應，不斷攻擊本島四周敵船船，予以相當損害，敵機動部隊已逃脫琉球海域日特攻隊銳鋒，企圖整頓陣容。陸上敵軍亦受重創，頃努力整頓基地，來襲列島線之敵機，二十七日有三十數架，二十九日九十架左右，三十日約八十架，六月一日約二百架，二十八日敵機約五十架襲九州南部地區。</p>
<p>馬里亞納小笠原方　面：隨沖繩戰局之日趨緊張，力謀消弱日特攻基地力量之馬里亞納基地之敵空軍，對九州方面頻施職術轟炸，經過一個月後，自上周起，再改變方針，對各都市不斷　施轟炸，企圖沮喪日本國民之戰意，且散步傳單，攪亂治安以及被壞工廠，阻礙生　等，而轉變為戰略轟炸。敵軍似為縮短對日作戰期間，減輕負擔起見，行動相當活潑，今後敵軍必備此方途推進其方策。</p>
<p>菲島方面：呂宋島方面之敵軍，努力加強航空要塞，已有相當成就。侵入碧瑤市及其附近之敵軍，為第三十三師，刻下似正整備攻擊態勢，其行動並不活潑。堅守北方及東方山地之日軍部隊，依然繼續實行肉搏攻擊，予敵以重創，巴拉特，薩拉薩克嶺北方陣地，依然展開激戰。該方面之敵軍爲第二十五師，三十二師及三十七師，此外，尚有戰車第十六師待機申。又五月中旬敵第二十五國之副師團長，於巴拉特地區戰死，五月十九日左右，於馬尼刺東方地區，有敵第四十三師團之一部，犯馬尼刺水源地帶伊波隨附近。又有騎兵第一師，經拉克那湖北方地區，於十七日抵達拉孟灣，該方面日軍據守山地，奮勇激戰。於民答那峨島南岸登陸之敵第三師，以及在北海岸登陸之第四十師，曾在麥來巴賴附近會師，　然企圖東進，然該地東方之日軍部隊常即激擊，予以重創。一方面日軍對於侵入納卯周邊，納卯河右岸日軍陣地之敵，誘其深入，刻死繼續於開壯烈血戰。又右岸地區之日軍部隊，於五月中旬以來，迭次擊退反覆來襲之敵軍，截至五月二十六日止，斃敵已達六千以上。</p>
<p>緬甸方面：英第三十六師團侵犯梅克迭拉東方加德附近，然該方面之日軍部隊當即迎擊，阻止其前進力，謀侵入自東瓜經喜丹河至加德莫爾門一帶之敵第十九師，亦遭日軍阻止，刻正展開激戰。日軍對在喜丹河河口附近渡河企圖東進之敵軍，迭次將之擊退，綜觀將入雨季之緬甸戰况，正於喜丹一河東岸地區進人正規化。</p>
<p>西南太平洋方面：泰拉干方面之敵軍，夾攻日第一綫之堅陣，反糧熾烈戰鬥，敵軍出動機甲部隊，試行突破或迂迥作戰，日軍對之施行大規模夜襲，數度殲減敵軍，戰局呈拉鋸狀，無大變化可常</p>
<p>帛琉方面：帛琉方面之日陸海軍部隊，自四月中旬左右至下旬止·施行帛琉及巴拉汪島間之水道掃蕩作戰，歷二旬間，斃敵約千名，擊沉艦艇數艘，奪回島　數個，顯示該方面日軍部隊依然健在。</p>
<h3>美船舶缺乏</h3>
<p>蘇黎世二日中央社電　據交換電訊社華盛頓電，美陸軍少將卡尼，頃就歐戰結束後船舶問題述稱：歐戰結束後，前在歐洲之船舶並不可獲得解放，反之，船舶問題將可逢到新困難。例如美國每日須以九萬噸汽油運往太平洋方面，但此項汽油僅佔大量作戰物資之一部份所已，且戰事日近日本土，即以運輸兵員而言，即需龐大船舶。</p>
<h3>蘇技術專家</h3>
<p>廣州三日中央社電　據到達此間之消息：蘇聯技術專家一行二十五名，業已抵達延安，渠等乃以從事延安軍之技術訓練，及陝西省農工業之組織化為目的。該派遣者中，有擔任延安政府之技術顧問，以便強化延安政府之軍事經濟工作。</p>
<h3>浙省擬組織　民衆諮詢會　負協助政府施策之責</h3>
<p>杭州三日中央社電　本省丁省長接任視事，調整各部組織機構，以期發揮戰時工作之效能，茲爲促使政府與人民打成一片，使上情下達而符施政之方策，俾適應現時環境之亟需起見，擬成立民衆諮詢委員會。其性質與普通民意機關不同。因普通民意機關和政府對立，但諮詢委員會在實質上與政府固為一體，負荷協助並指導政府實施政策之責，各委員係由本省各士紳及各階層推選，刻已將擬具之組織規程等，呈奉國府行政院鑒核，一俟呈准，即可付諸實施。預卜今後浙省施政必瞭如指掌，而諮詢會能貴獻於當局者當亦匪淺。</p>
<p>蔴麥增產推進計劃</p>
<p>杭州三日中央社電　浙省農業策進會以　類爲工業所必需，乃屬軍用品之一，除指定栽蔴區域大量生產外，復在各地增加指定植蔴面積，每畝規定輔助費為三百元，本省補助總額，俟面積確定後，再行申請中央核定補助費額，務使今後蔴產農富，以供路社會之需要。</p>
<p>杭州三日中央社電　小麥爲冬季農作物，亦爲主要糧食之一，與稻作同一重要。浙省農業策進會對於小麥施種·選肥·除草·以及實施新式之播種方法，應由農業協進會及受訓之中堅農民實地指導，其指導獎勵費，俟各省市統艦籌劃後，再行決定。</p>
<h3>蕪青年館　紀念禁煙節</h3>
<p>蕪湖三日中央社電　今日爲六三禁烟節，本縣靑年館除於上午九時舉行紀念儀式外，並發表「告靑少年書」，薪以喚起民衆認職禁煙之意義，協力政府完成拒毒之政策。</p>
<h3>特邱史會議　本月中舉行</h3>
<p>里斯本三日中央社電　據華盛頓消息：特魯曼總統今日確切說明三巨頭會議，將於不久之將來舉行，對集會地點並未披露，但聲明未必在美國舉行。特魯曼總統事前會與邱吉爾首相密切接洽，於會議前預作籌劃。</p>
<p>又電　據舊金山消息靈通方面悉：特魯曼總統與邱吉爾史太林之第一次會議，將於六月半左右舉行，如舊金山會議延期至八月半以後，特魯曼統恐不能照預定計劃，出席最後一次會議發表演說，三巨頭會議當不致因舊金山會議之延期而受影響</p>
<h3>杉山總軍司令官授小林機隊獎狀　日陸軍省昨日已予發表</h3>
<p>東京三日中央社電日　小林戰鬥機部隊，會担任本土制空部隊，饒勇奮戰，半年間擊落，擊毀敵機百七十八架，　成防衛國土之大任·該戰鬥機部隊計擊落B29型機七十三架，F6型機十架，SB2型機一架，擊毀B28型機九十二架，F6型機二架，擊落合計百七十八架，因此於五月十五日由總軍司令官杉山元授與獎狀，今由陸軍省發表其偉功，已奏達上聞。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>近東戰亂餘三巨頭會議</h3>
<p>法國對近東二小國叙利亞和黎巴嫩問的武裝衝突，已使英國外相艾登公開宣稱爲「情勢極度嚴重」，蘇聯外交人民委員會也向英美法渝提出緊急建議，認爲叙利亞和黎巴嫩與法軍　所發生的武裝衝突，違反鄧巴頓橡樹會議所決定的精神原則，違反舊金山聯合果會議討論建立保障民族和平與安全組織之目的。很明顯的，這次近東所發生的戰亂，不僅是法國臨時政府政策荒謬的表現，而且也正是所謂聯合國</p>
<p>叙利亞和黎巴嫩，自第一次世界大戰以來，即在法國帝國主義的軍事控制之下，視同法國的殖民地。但是由於敘利亞和黎巴嫩所處低位的關係，久成為歐洲列強爭奪的對象。第一，這個國家（二次大戰前黎巴嫩為敘利亞之一部份）雖是歷史上的文明古國，但是經濟和政治一直落後腐敗，加以民族及宗教上的紛歧，內部常不統一，致列强視爲俎上之肉；第二，國內物資豐富，尤以石油生產及國際油管所經，握有東地中海主要吞吐港，所以更爲列强所涶涎；第三，在戰略地位上當歐亞交通衝途，向為英法德俄兵家必爭之地。在這種種條件之下，這惆國家久有近東的火藥庫之名。</p>
<p>二次大戰爆發，特戈爾將軍在英國支援下發動叙利亞之戰，結果維希政府派的鄧資將軍屈服，叙利亞入特戈爾之乎。當時特戈爾初出茅蘆，爲收拾人民計，在「自由法國」的旅幟之下，允准叙利亞黎巴嫩獨立建國。叙黎人民及近東各地各族，莫不額手稱慶，使特戈爾將軍在國際間的聲聯日隆。不意最近特戈爾還都巴黎，恢復法國爲世界「五强」之一的虛名以後，又顯露其爲帝國主義制度之保衛者的面目，對叙黎態度突然轉變，不願放棄法國在叙黎二國的特權，使叙黎及近東各族，騷然不安。</p>
<p>法國對叙黎二國態度之所以轉變，其主要原囚，實係鑒於舊金山會議中對於未來國際安全保障機構的討論，依然唯强者爲有理，各大强國占有絕大權力，而對於委任統治權及殖民地問題，英美蘇渝之間，未能獲得眞誠的同意。這一切刺激了特戈爾政府，妄想效法英美，霸佔及恢復其在世界的殖民地，而以叙黎兩國開始，進而恢復二次大戰前法國的殖民地威權，即所謂近東－印度洋－遠東法國殖民地圈，而與英國競爭。</p>
<p>不過，英國爲保障共歐亞戰略及經濟聯絡綫，對於足以威脅此聯絡綫之中心的蘇彝士運河的叙黎二國，也決不允許再爲法國所獨佔，因此，他們對於叙黎二國也有種種活動。同時，叙黎兩國，自去年歐局轉變以來，爲求獲得有力的外援起見，已先後和蘇聯建立外交關係。當蘇聯在東南歐的勢力普遍發展之際，對遠東地中海門戶和近東各國中樞的叙黎二國，自亦樂於援助。在這種複雜的國際關係之下，叙黎二國對法軍的術突事件，當然有轟動國際視聽的力量了。</p>
<p>現在，由於邱吉爾親向特戈爾致書警告，通令停戰收兵，並令英國近東駐兵相機活動，叉有蘇聯的出而干涉，大概叙黎之亂，暫時會平靜下去；但是，上述種種複雜的因素，却只會因此「治絲益棼」。加以最近又有英軍和南斯拉夫軍對的里雅斯德港駐兵問題的衝突，以及伊朗要求英美蘇軍撤退的事件，其間關係之複雜錯粽，也不下於叙黎問題。大概非待特邱史三頭會議不能獲得解决。而在現狀之下，特魯曼旣苦於美國社會及內政問題的日趨嚴重，邱吉爾又臨工保二黨血戰關頭，那麼，三頭會議縱使能在短期內勉强召集，其結果如何，實在也不難預卜的。</p>
<p>地方通訊</p>
<h3>申江縣全貌（下）</h3>
<p>— 余昆</p>
<p>人民自有房屋者，占全縣半數以上，奠壓居住者，爲數較少，租金前曾一度論米計算，今已照現金折算天。普通一上一下，在繁盛區侮月租金約八千元，平房約六千元，在住宅區每月約四千元，但尋常一室需一二千元。人民類能自食其力，故生活狀况，此較尚佳，惟年來物價不斷增高，且受滬市之影響，茍不格外儉約，並勞力增進生產，恐難長此優遊也。</p>
<p>捐稅方面，名目繁夥，除應賦之國稅與市稅外，尚有苛捐雜稅，總共不下二十種之多。大有不勝負擔之概</p>
<p>物價除米略低外，其他物品亦在逐步高昇中。茲將本月二十三日常地各種物價，舉例如後：</p>
<p>來每擔十五萬元（一百五十斤），淸油侮斤一千五百元，菜油每斤一千六百元，棉花每擔五萬餘元，監侮斤一百八十元，大黃豆每斤六百元，赤豆每斤七百元，雞蛋侮只一百十元，肉侮斤一千三百元，豆腐五十元起碼，同本肥皂侮槐七百元，火柴侮盒一百二十元，洋燭侮枝七百元，大餅汕條侮件百元，熟水每勺百元，生水（河水）侮擔七十元至一百元不等，豆箕柴每擔五千元，稻柴每擔三千五百元。</p>
<p>綜觀上列各種物價，除日用品外，其餘均校上海爲廉。昔本縣商業，向冠全國，經屢次劃分後，繁盛之市鄉，俱歸上海市管轄，餘剩者商業均甚清淡，惟閔行鎭比較稍優，其次則爲　橋鎭與馬橋鎭，餘不足論。商業一切市面，均以上海市商悄爲轉移，此後交通便利，運輸迅速，或可望商業之振興也。本縣向爲農業區域，近年頗趨於工業化，烟突高聳，工廠林立，其出品以磚瓦之絲織品，紗布爲最著，固成本低康，製作精良，故能暢銷全國。事變後，以種種原因，停閉者不在少數，現僅存若干小工廠，其產品以棉花</p>
<p>至於金融狀况，均以上海市爲轉移，除閔行設有銀行二家，信託公司一家外，其餘無規模宏大之金融機關。閔行鎭有申江合作支社　社員約一萬六千人　社內資金總共不足一百萬元，因辦理失當，以致虧蝕迨盡，近社方爲發展計劃，議決增資、由侮戶六十元改爲一千元。關於農貸，合作社曾與交通銀行舉辦。起切每人五千元，後增至每戶二萬元，貸出總教約五百餘萬元，月息僅三分。其缺點爲申請以至直接貸與農民，所經時間，往往拖延數月，以致喪失其效用，對於農民未能應其急需，此點甚望當局改業之。貸款用途大都爲用以購肥料種子農具等。</p>
<p>縣民職業，以農居多，其次為商及工，無業遊民，爲數甚少。救濟事業以閔行普安堂爲最著，其次爲閔行施療局，最近類多經費不充，因陋就簡，貧民殊難受其實惠。</p>
<p>本縣各鄉鎭，街道狹窄，汚穢滿地，市商會當局，有鑒於此，特在閔行鎭籌款舉辦公廁，路燈，淸道等，其經常費爲由公廁所得之　穢，售諸農民，以辦地方公共衛生，成績極佳。近市政府認該事應歸衛生局管轄，特指派當地「茂生淸潔所」代辦，自接管以來，僅將糞穢出售，而對於公共衛生殊甚忽視，故市容反不如前。閔行鎭設有私立醫院一所，設備完善，為唯一西　，其他各鎭僅略設私人</p>
<p>全縣僅有中學三所，小學數十所。各校經費，縣立除政府每月津貼三萬零四百四十元外，其於不足之數，均由市商會負責籌補，私校則賴學費收入，及諸校董之負責捐助。</p>
<p>縣立中學學費，每人五千元，但尚覺不能担負，私校略高。以學費昂貴，鄉民大都不能遣其子弟入學，以目前學齡兒童論，入學者僅及十分之二三。至教員待遇，以塘灣鎭慈康中學長佳，每教員平均每月配給食米一石左右，較諸縣立中學，每小時二百元，相差甚遠。因待遇關係，師資亦有差別，慈康中學教員均在高中以上程度，其他較低，甚至有小學畢榮担任小學教師者。至學生程度，大都今昔懸殊。</p>
<p>記者於抵縣之初，曾訪問縣政府揭縣長李光源氏，請發表最近施政方針，闡明　詳，今略誌於后：</p>
<p>一切行政之革新，均建立於張固的治安與經濟基礎上，本縣位居上海之一隅，治安第一，交通便利，紹濟自不難確立，但目前各方尚未臻完善之道，故自接管以來，擬加改革。</p>
<p>本縣經濟，建立於農業生產，欲使人民生活安定，唯有復興農村經濟。主要工作爲改良生產按術，使各農作物順利進行耕耘，以達增產實效，此舉對上海散疏人口工作，亦有裨益。</p>
<p>健全交通構，促進物資流通。滬閔路爲市區與縣治重要交通幹綫，事變以來，路面損毀頗甚，近以公路交通運輸益增重要，故擬於農忙期後，由各區鎭長負責，徽用民伕，修理各區段公路，限期完成之。</p>
<p>組織政工宣傳隊，使一般人民明瞭政治工作之重要與內容，協助政府同向復興之路邁進。</p>
<p>强化保甲，各區鎭雖有保甲組織，惟極幼稚，今後宜加整頓，切實指導，則對當地治安，更能確保。</p>
<p>禁除烟賭，近來各鄉烟賭之風甚盛，尤以閔行爲長，雖未公開唯有關地方風紀，故隆於六月三日禁烟節，舉行禁除烟毒淸潔運動，開演講會，放映「萬世流芳」影片，宣傳烟毒之害，並積極設法取締各烟賭機關與集合地。</p>
<p>提高教育行政及其他公務機關之設備及待過，俾增進地方公益（完）</p>
<h3>舊金山會討論　軍事強制辦法　投保手續問題形成僵局</h3>
<p>里斯本三日中央社電　舊金山電：在否決權與委任統治制度兩問題尚待解決時，聯合國會議茲又討論以五國為領袖之安全理事會所提軍事強制辦注。昨晚實施辦法委員會開會時，會經通過修正案一則，決定在渝·美·英·蘇·舉行會商時，法國亦　出席，並規定在安全理事會之兵力特別協定，開始生效以前之過渡期間內，採取共同行動以維和平。關於上述特別協定其軍事協定，因有人懷疑世界　斗時，始能獲得五國與其他半數會員國必要之批准，是以關於軍事協定之談判，事實上必須遲緩非至彼時不能進行。</p>
<p>里斯本三日中央社電　據舊金山電：關於安全保障理事會投票手續問題，蘇聯政府之回電述至一日夜始送達蘇聯代表之手。英、美、蘇、渝、法五國代表即於是夜舉行會議，英美兩國對於蘇之主張，終於形成正面衝突，會議仍無何等結論，即行終止。五國會議席上仍繼續從事商討，雙方之間俱各執一詞，難驅一致，舊金山會議最後結果，將陷於無可打開之僵局。大多數小國依英美兩國之主張，自不待言，爲絕對反對蘇聯，故此點蘇聯已成弧立之形態，焦慮會議終給之英美兩國，一再按照鄧巴頓奧克斯會議之投票手續，委之今後協議。然小國代表以爲投票手絨，乃爲國際機構案中最重要之規定，如此事米經決定，則機構案之全部早已毫無意義，故表示猛烈反對之意，央美兩國已處於進退兩難之境。</p>
<h3>蘇報暴露　美領土野心</h3>
<p>瑞典京城三日中央社電隨世界戰局之恒移，美蘇對立已臻於激化。茲據二日莫斯科廣播，暴露美對太平洋領土之野心。據穌聯政府機關報「新聞報」舊金山特派員報告要如次：美國太平洋戰爭之主題，似猶英帝國主義要人「基布林克之殖民地英雄主義」一般美國民，其巾以將兵為對象之新聞雜誌傳單等，以至於政治指導者之言論，俱一貫如此等之思想，主張美國必須領有太平洋島嶼，美參院議員及提督或許論家亦取除此之外不得解決太平洋問題之能度。蓋美國索抱在太平洋獲勝之夢想，以爲必須確保大殖民地之資產。</p>
<h3>對法敘紛爭　特戈爾談話</h3>
<p>里斯本三日中央社電據巴黎電：特戈爾將軍昨日會見記者團曾宣稱，現在法國已作參加議和會議之準備，唯該項議和會議之召開，必須不僅爲調解叙黎兩國之問題，並須涉及整個東部阿刺伯處置之問起。</p>
<p>百倫三日中央社電</p>
<p>據貝魯特傳稱：里文達戰爭已告終結，目前現呈舉行會議前之狀態。大馬色之秩序亦已恢復，在貝魯特雖尚有英軍在道上巡邏，一般民衆均極為安靜。出席阿刺伯聯盟會議之黎巴嫩代表團，因　於里文達局勢之轉變，亦於昨日離開開羅。</p>
<p>大馬色城戰後景象</p>
<p>據會至大馬色作巡禮回來者談稱，「叙利亞京城目前之景象，極似遭受空襲後之英國倫敦」。渠会向路透社記者談述謂，該地確有損害及毀壞，街道中猶有火燄，大部份道路仍可修筑，然有一小部非重新建造不可。</p>
<h3>社福部籌劃　救濟空災</h3>
<p>南京三日中央社電　社會福利部以邇來各地頻遭空襲，一般無辜民眾頗多死傷，故該部彭部長自接事後，除一面積極加強部務外，復　籌劃普遍救濟空襲災害辦法，期以救濟被災人民，關於經費，正在竭力設法中。</p>
<h3>美機盲炸下的我國民衆</h3>
<p>敵美企圖以巾國大陸爲戰塲，對中國無辜民衆，監施轟炸，過去如長沙市之被炸，最爲悽慘。上圖爲被炸後之長沙市內，發生大火，消防人員正在烈燄中從事減火及救護工作。左右兩婦人，臉部絢被彈片炸傷，轉輾呻吟，痛苦萬狀。下圖爲扶幼携老，逃避轟炸之民衆，回首故園，已成瓦碟，不勝悲働。</p>

<h3>當局協商民食力方策　嚴禁囤積操縱　劉經濟局長盼全市商民合作</h3>
<p>新任市經濟局局長劉星晨接事後，決依遵中央一切經濟法令，推進戰時經濟施策，對於米價之狂漲，及其他一般物價不會理之滕升，尤爲關心，定予嚴行取締。昨特發表談話，深望全市商民，密切合作，以謀市面之安定。茲誌談話如下：</p>
<p>米價猛漲</p>
<p>嚴重問題目前米價爲本市經濟上之中心間題，近數日來，各項物價無不畸形飛漲，而以食米價格之上漲尤爲狂烈，瞬息數變，殊出情理之常。揆其原因，由於靑黃不接，運輸梗阻，來源不暢，以致市民心理上發生不安狀態，誠恐米之不易得，爭相購買，售米者正利用其心理上之不安，任意報價，以爲居奇。街談巷議，奔走惶惑，沿途所見，時有鳩形鵠面之徒，傷心慘目，無逾於斯。若不亟謀救濟，上海市數百萬人生命，將瀕於危境，此不僅爲經濟問題，抑且爲最嚴重之社會問題，瞻望前途，思之痛心。</p>
<p>當局協商</p>
<p>有效方案本人於上海市經濟，處於混亂狀熊之際，奉命担任經濟局長，職責所在，不容忽視，亦不忍忽視。奉市長曁秘書畏指示，疊經與盟邦有關當局再四研討，咸對於上海市民食問題，認爲事態嚴重，對於疏通來源一端，允作有力之協助，决不置上海市數百萬市民口食於不顧。市府最高當局，亦無日不與盟邦最高常局，協商有效方策。</p>
<p>囤積居奇</p>
<p>依法論罪至於運輸困難，物資缺乏，固非目近日始，市民消費如故，運輸之情形如故，何以數日之間，有米自十萬元一石增達數倍以上，殊屬不鈑悄理，此非有人故意居奇囤積所致而何？社會安寗，須市民共同維持，未有社會不安而個人能獨善其身者。倘發見有囤積操縱居奇情事，政府決毫無顧忌，依法論罪。除與經濟保安處聯絡取締外，希望商民自覺自勉，勿蹈法網，並盼節省不必要之消耗，利用雜糧代替，共度靑黃不接時問，尤勿輕信謠言，自相驚擾。</p>
<p>任意漲價</p>
<p>嚴行取締關於一般物價之上漲，雖各有原因，然利用時機任意增列價格，希圖取巧者，實居多數。無論籍口成本如何，均不合理，必須嚴行取締。本局奉行經濟法令，並以實行爲依歸，値此戰特經濟體制之下，一般價格，尤須合法合理，灤盼全市商民，密切合作，共循正軌，以謀市面之安定，不勝企望。</p>

<h3>財局準備開徵　夏季營業稅　市區各縣同時開徵</h3>
<p>市財政局開徵春季營業稅，係准各業向市商會之請求，僅依本年一二三月份之營業額爲課稅之標準，並因時間關係，經先接受辦理申報及繳納稅款工作，截至目前爲止，該局所收春季營業總額，約計已有十萬萬元左右。至於各業報稅初杳工作，刻正在積極推進中。另悉該局現已進行準備開徵夏季營業稅，實行期間大致在本月上旬左右，一俟市府核復到局，即可正式公布。屆時開徵此稅，市區與市郊各縣區，均將同時開始，且依照本年一二月份各業之實際營業額，作爲夏季四五六月份踝稅之標準，同時仍予繼續派員分向各指定區域調查各商號所報之春季營業稅，是否屬實。</p>
<h3>上週金融市况　波動猛烈</h3>
<p>本市金融市况，在國際風雲變幻聲中，動盪不定，最近一週依然不脫險境，雖由中央儲備銀行發行金證券，企圖抑制高風，但投機市儈，仍利用寬鬆游資，興風作浪，散播流言，煽惑人心，操縱市價，從中撈獲非法暴利。烚赤在一週中，忽漲忽跌，高低相差四十關左右。華股迭見新高舉，三熱門股漲跌活絡，中小型股漲多跌少，週一初見平空，週二午後又見回升，週三更形盤高，週四因某種不利多頭消息，大小型股一致出籠，一片叫賣聲，大有江河日下之勢，不意週五下午突轉回升，週六上午半日依然直綫上升，實出一般所預料。紋銀公債及各種敵性貨幣，莫不　續從上漲。工商各業方面，因貨物成本加高，生產減少，均提高售價，尤以主要商品有關民食之米糧·雜糧·油·糖·柴炭，及肥皂·火柴·洋燭等，售價暴漲漫無止境，社會民生，更趨嚴重。所謂市物價評議委員會核定之限價，無一不暗中擅自抬高二倍以上，社會各界人士，莫不殷盼市政當局，採取强有力手段抑平物價，以蘇民因，勿再因循延遲。</p>

<h3>里弄與馬路不宜視為運動塲所</h3>
<p>— 顧期仲</p>
<p>里弄與馬路，爲公共交通之要道，自應保持秩序，斷不可視爲運動塲所，作種種游戲，致妨公共交通，此盡人皆知也。</p>
<p>然一般無知學童，或係廠工，或係遊手，侮喜就近即在馬路通衢之中，玩踢大小皮球，甚有將堅硬結實之網球，亦對賜於途間，偶一不愼，小則溝泥濺著人衣，大則球力傷及人體。路有出而勸阻者，凡被詬誶，暴者更欲逞兇殺人，此類糾紛之事，固已屢見不鮮。而最不解者崗在警士並不加以干涉。</p>
<p>筆者某日行經馬當路之際，忽迎面一球飛來，幸即速避，未被著身，而著後來行駛一自由車者之眼鏡，鏡應聲碎地，而大哭，婦欲追捕肇禍者，已遠颶矣。又一日在康定路玩球者數人，對足一球，適高墮前餅攤商之油鍋之中，猝不及防，沸油濺及商人面部立即膿泡立起，幾沒於眼，該商人一时呼痛欲捕，玩踢者遂一哄而散，又邇來市上製售鉛絲之彈弓玩具，大都兒童亦在馬路間玩彈，不特自相肇禍，抑亦更易妨害於公衆，蓋或則彈痛人面，或且彈傷人目。一般頑童，輒以車輛爲彈弓之目標。一日大興路至無軌電車，方在疾馳西行，羣童競相玩彈，而彈出之物，多取諸砂石與黃豆之類，是時　果殃及車內一客販商之額，客一時下車不能，徒然探首窗外而大罵。諸如此類之行爲，實不得不謂爲可惡也。</p>
<p>故希望馬路站崗警察遇有涉及妨害公安與秩序者，自當　以利害，加以禁止，勿以事小而不加干涉，致妨秩序，而肇禍端。同時亦深盼各教師戒其生徒各家長規其子弟勿在馬路或里弄，作妨碍交通之遊戲。</p>
<h3>防空訓練所　同學會成立　昨舉行隆重儀式</h3>

<p>會長</p>
<p>致　會長致辭，略謂：「今大舉行成立大會，集防空訓練所三届畢業同學於一堂，精神國　，也互協力，本人衷心欣慰，目今局勢日趨緊張，敵英美欲達到其侵略目的，利用種種手段，侵襲大東亞各地，殘殺無辜，同時大上海亦爲其侵襲之目標；一再加以　炸，故吾人防空任務之重大，無庸　述，但在上海一般市民對防空任務，尚欠認識與期心，各同學爲防空指導人員，是應負起重大之指導責任，務望軍警人民打成一片，完成大上海防空使命，保衛大上海安令。</p>
<p>顧繼</p>
<p>武詞名譽會長顧　武致詞，略謂：「今天舉行同學會成立大會，全體優秀同學，濟濟一堂，此抓團結之精神，　使我有無限感想，深信中日兩國問題在此融洽之空氣中，彼此非常自然，相互恭敬與合作，觀此大可安慰。問顧德法兩國當初受歐美野心國之煽動，而掀起爭鬥，結果雨敗俱傷，遭遇同樣命運。我東亞人自當猛醒，中日兩國同文同種是應站在同一立塲，我中華民國之立塲為求自由獨立生存，更須遵照孫總理遺囑，聯合世界上平等待我之民族，共同奮鬥，則日本即爲以平等待我之民族，英美人對我國之侵略政策，有識之士，均已洞悉，對於東亞並不以黃種人放之於心；故無日本即無東亞，無中國即無日本，無日本亦無中國，中日關係，極度密切，吾人是當同生共死，協力保衛大東亞。敵機一再侵襲滬市殘殺無辜，吾人應堅强防空任務，亦如理智所認淸之使命，同時是項使命之意義　常偉大，吾全體同學均爲義務職，以服務社會入類互助之眞理爲前題，故甚望各位精神團結，勢力防空任務，並祝各位身體健康」。</p>
<p>周部</p>
<p>長詞編爲長官致訓詞，先由周兼部長代表，主任秘書曹今港致訓，略謂：「今天在此舉行防空訓練所同學會成立大會，本人代表周兼部長，向谷位同學簡單說幾句，見到各位精誠團結，精神蓬勃之氣魄，無限欣佩。目今局勢日趨嚴重，空中戰鬥，在科學昌明之今日，日趨進步，敵機狂施轟炸，慘殺無辜百姓，吾人自當强化防禦工作。上海爲中國政治經濟文化之中心，隨時有被空襲之可能，當局已成立市民防空本部，强化市民防空工作，並訓練一般優秀靑年爲指導人員，三届畢業之同學已六百餘人，今天舉行同學會成立大會，即爲今後工作之再出發點。各位將所學到之各種技能與學術，誠懇的指導民衆，並從今開始發揮新的精神，團結一致，相互研究，合作帮助，發揚總的力量，則其功效必更大。同時吾人應認淸大上海是吾人之故鄉，吾人皆爲市民一份子，應合五百萬市民同心協力，保衛大上海，恭祝各位健康，前途光明。」續由警防處長，日海軍防空司令部代表等相繼致訓，語多勗勉，辭畢即宣讀成立宣言。最後放映「爆風與彈片」防空影片，至十二時許始畢</p>
<p>成立</p>
<p>宣言防空訓練所同學會成立宣言，防空訓練所同學會，今在防空本部當局協力贊助之下，幸告成立，吾　畢業同學，從此有團體之組織，則對於大上海之保衛，將以集團之力量，隨時應付突來之恐怖空襲，俾市民所蒙之損害，減至最少限度，亦將藉此發揮我防空指導員之偉力。茲於本會成立之初，謹將組織宗旨，略陳於后：第一，增進防空之效率，提高市民防空常識。在今戰爭已至最後關頭之局勢下，空襲之危機，迫於眉睫，雖當局規定，每月九日爲防空日，普遍施行防空演習，以喚起市民之警惕，完成一切防空必要之準備，俾大衆臨危不亂，然就事實而論，多數市民，或猶不明防空意義，袖坐而作壁上之觀，或以未受充分訓練，雖有志於防空，而苦技術之拙劣，無以發揮其能力，此則有待於我畢業同學之指導，申之以利害，教之以技術，期使全市居民，盡人管知，盡人能行，庶幾不負防空指導員之名義，惟是個人之力量有限，而學識經騐，尤感不足，則實施工作之時，方法不能至於完善，轉生各種障礙，自亦勢所難免，若能羣策羣力，不間始終，可以團體之力量，解決惆人之困難，又有各位長官師長足資諮詢，則不但可以增進個人之學識，即就指導市民之效率而言，亦必提高。換言之，即有更大之力量，以貢獻於社會。第二，聯絡感情，互相砥礪。我　雖爲身強力健之靑年，又曾共同研究，且志皆在服務人羣，在防空之標幟下，步伐一致，但吾人或因受訓之時期不同，或因所居地域互異，彼此不相織者甚多，今得在同學會之組織下，時相集會，砥礪切磋，不惟可以集思廣益，收指臂之助，且可以聯絡感情，增進友誼，本會之宗旨，旣如上述，幸我諸同學能深切瞭解，身體力行，使本會發揚光大，庶領導市民，可以安渡此空襲　仍之大難，跂予望之。</p>

<h3>Decisive Battles on All Fronts in Southern Okinawa Island: The War Situation Nears a Critical Juncture; The Japanese Army Has Reaped Astonishing War Gains in the Past Two Months</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) – The ground battles in the southern Okinawa region have reached a fever pitch. Both sides are pouring in their main forces, and a major decisive battle is unfolding across the entire front. On the 31st, the enemy invaded Naha City and the Shuri Castle ruins, which are major Japanese army strongholds. Furthermore, a portion of the enemy army continued south from the vicinity of Yonabaru, reaching Inafuku (approximately 30 kilometers south of Yonabaru), where fierce battles, a veritable mountain of corpses and river of blood, are being fought with the intercepting Japanese army. The enemy is currently pouring in the full force of approximately seven divisions on the front line, attempting to forcibly break through the central defense lines of the Japanese army. The war situation in Okinawa is approaching a critical juncture.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) – Since landing on the main island of Okinawa on April 1st, the enemy army has been subjected to special attacks from the Japanese army in the air, on land, and at sea for more than two months. Suffering heavy casualties, they are still attempting to advance south on the main island, seeking to break through the Japanese army's strong defenses, but have been met with fierce counterattacks from the Japanese army. The enemy's personnel losses in the southern part of the main island alone have exceeded 50,000 men. Four out of the eight divisions of the enemy's total landing force have completely lost their ability to fight. In addition, the Japanese air force and special attack units have continuously launched fierce attacks on the enemy's fleet and the mobile task force entrenched in the seas to the east of Okinawa, sinking and destroying 566 enemy combat vessels, including aircraft carriers, battleships, and transport ships. Furthermore, enemy airfield facilities are bombed and set on fire daily. Faced with the relentless Japanese air attacks, the enemy, in an attempt to reverse the situation, has mobilized the British mobile task force and simultaneously deployed B-29 aircraft from the Mariana Islands base, conducting tactical bombing raids to support the carrier-based aircraft operations. For more than a month, they have launched direct attacks on Japanese air bases in the Kyushu region. On the other hand, they are attempting to crush the Japanese will to fight and disrupt production and transportation, intensifying strategic bombing, and indiscriminately bombing important cities such as Tokyo, Yokohama, Osaka, and Kobe. As such, the battle for the defense of Okinawa Island is becoming increasingly fierce, and has now reached its peak. The Japanese side has achieved astonishing war gains, but the enemy, still relying on materiel, disregards serious losses and sacrifices and fights the Japanese army to the bitter end. Now the Okinawa war situation is gradually becoming critical.</p>
<h3>Weekly War Situation in Various Parts of East Asia</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) – The war situation in various parts of East Asia during the past week is as follows:</p>
<p>Okinawa Area: Fierce battles continue in the southern part of Okinawa Island. The focus of the attack is on the east coast, where the enemy army is attempting to strike directly at the flanks and rear of the Japanese army, gradually invading the area south of Yonabaru. A decisive battle is unfolding between the two armies at Japanese army positions between Shuri and Yonabaru, such as Kōchi and Naha City. The Japanese air force is coordinating its efforts, constantly attacking enemy ships around the main island, inflicting considerable damage. The enemy mobile task force has escaped the sharp edge of the Japanese special attack units in the Ryukyu waters and is attempting to reorganize its formation. The enemy ground forces have also suffered heavy losses and are currently working to consolidate their bases. Enemy aircraft attacking the Ryukyu Islands numbered about 30 on the 27th, about 90 on the 29th, about 80 on the 30th, and about 200 on June 1st. On the 28th, about 50 enemy aircraft attacked the southern Kyushu region.</p>
<p>Mariana and Ogasawara Areas: As the Okinawa war situation becomes increasingly tense, the enemy air force from the Mariana Islands base, seeking to weaken the strength of Japanese special attack bases, has frequently conducted tactical bombing raids on the Kyushu region. After a month, starting last week, they have changed their strategy again, continuously conducting bombing raids on various cities, attempting to depress the Japanese people's will to fight, and spreading leaflets, disrupting public order, and destroying factories, hindering production, etc., thus transitioning to strategic bombing. The enemy army seems to be quite active in its actions, aiming to shorten the duration of the war against Japan and reduce its burden, and will definitely advance its policies in this direction in the future.</p>
<p>Philippine Islands Area: The enemy army in the Luzon area is working hard to strengthen its air fortresses and has achieved considerable success. The enemy army that has invaded Baguio City and its vicinity belongs to the 33rd Division and seems to be preparing an offensive posture, but its actions are not very active. The Japanese army units defending the northern and eastern mountainous areas continue to carry out close-quarters combat attacks, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. Fierce battles continue at the northern positions of Balete and Salacsac Pass. The enemy forces in that area are the 25th, 32nd, and 37th Divisions, in addition to the 16th Tank Division standing by. Furthermore, in mid-May, the deputy commander of the enemy's 25th Division was killed in action in the Balete area. Around May 19th, a portion of the enemy's 43rd Division attacked the Ipo Dam area, the water source for Manila, to the east of Manila. Also, the 1st Cavalry Division, passing through the area north of Laguna de Bay, reached Lamon Bay on the 17th. The Japanese army in that area is holding the mountainous areas, engaging in fierce battles with great courage. The enemy's 3rd Division, which landed on the southern coast of Mindanao Island, and the 40th Division, which landed on the northern coast, met near Malaybalay, attempting to advance east. However, the Japanese army units to the east of that area immediately engaged them, inflicting heavy casualties. On the other hand, the Japanese army is luring the enemy, which has invaded the periphery of Davao and the right bank of the Davao River, into the depths of Japanese army positions, and is continuing to engage in a fierce and bloody battle. Furthermore, since mid-May, the Japanese army units in the right bank area have repeatedly repelled the enemy army's repeated attacks, killing more than 6,000 enemy soldiers by May 26th.</p>
<p>Burma Area: The British 36th Division invaded the area near Kyaukse, east of Meiktila. However, the Japanese army units in that area immediately engaged them, stopping their advance. The enemy's 19th Division, which attempted to invade the area from Toungoo, via the Sittang River, to Kado and Mawlaik, was also stopped by the Japanese army, and fierce battles are unfolding. The Japanese army has repeatedly repelled the enemy army attempting to cross the river and advance east near the mouth of the Sittang River. Looking at the Burma war situation, which is about to enter the rainy season, it is entering a state of normalization in the area east of the Sittang River.</p>
<p>Southwest Pacific Area: The enemy army in the Tarakan area is attacking the Japanese army's strong first-line positions, engaging in fierce battles. The enemy army has deployed armored units, attempting to break through or conduct flanking maneuvers. The Japanese army is conducting large-scale night attacks against them, repeatedly wiping out enemy forces. The war situation is in a stalemate, with no major changes to note.</p>
<p>Palau Area: From around mid-April to late April, the Japanese army and navy units in the Palau area conducted sweeping operations in the waters between Palau and Babeldaob Island. During the two weeks, they killed approximately 1,000 enemy soldiers, sank several ships, and recaptured several islands, showing that the Japanese army units in that area are still in good shape.</p>
<h3>Shortage of American Ships</h3>
<p>Zurich, 2nd (Central News Agency) – According to a Washington dispatch from the Exchange Telegraph, Major General Kearney of the U.S. Army recently stated regarding the shipping problem after the end of the European war: After the end of the European war, the ships previously in Europe will not be released. On the contrary, the shipping problem will encounter new difficulties. For example, the United States must transport 90,000 tons of gasoline to the Pacific area every day, but this gasoline accounts for only a portion of the vast amount of war materials. Moreover, as the war nears the Japanese mainland, a large number of ships will be needed for transporting personnel alone.</p>
<h3>Soviet Technical Experts</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 3rd (Central News Agency) – According to news arriving here: A group of 25 Soviet technical experts has arrived in Yan'an. Their purpose is to engage in technical training for the Yan'an army and the organization of agriculture and industry in Shaanxi Province. Among those dispatched are technical advisors to the Yan'an government, in order to strengthen the military and economic work of the Yan'an government.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Province Plans to Organize a People's Advisory Council to Be Responsible for Assisting the Government in Implementing Policies</h3>
<p>Hangzhou, 3rd (Central News Agency) – Since Governor Ding of this province took office, he has adjusted the organizational structure of various departments in order to give play to the effectiveness of wartime work. In order to promote the unity of the government and the people, to convey the situation above to those below and conform to the policies, and to meet the urgent needs of the current environment, it is planned to establish a People's Advisory Council. Its nature is different from that of ordinary public opinion organs. Because ordinary public opinion organs are opposed to the government, but the Advisory Council is essentially one with the government, responsible for assisting and guiding the government in implementing policies. The members of the council are selected by various gentry and strata in this province. The drafted organizational regulations, etc., have been submitted to the Executive Yuan of the National Government for review and approval. Once approved, they can be implemented. It is predicted that the implementation of policies in Zhejiang Province in the future will be as clear as pointing at one's palm, and the Advisory Council's contributions to the authorities will not be insignificant.</p>
<p>Flax and Ramie Production Increase Plan</p>
<p>Hangzhou, 3rd (Central News Agency) – The Zhejiang Provincial Agricultural Promotion Association believes that textiles are necessary for industry and are one of the military supplies. In addition to designating flax and ramie growing areas for mass production, the association is also increasing the designated planting area in various places. The subsidy is set at 300 yuan per mu. The total subsidy amount for this province will be determined and applied to the central government for approval after the area is determined. The goal is to make flax and ramie production benefit farmers and meet the needs of society.</p>
<p>Hangzhou, 3rd (Central News Agency) – Wheat is a winter crop and also one of the main food crops, as important as rice cultivation. For wheat planting, fertilizer selection, weeding, and the implementation of new planting methods, the Zhejiang Provincial Agricultural Promotion Association will have the Agricultural Promotion Association and trained backbone farmers provide on-site guidance. The guidance incentive fee will be determined after the provinces and cities plan a unified fleet.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Near East War and Three Giants Conference</h3>
<p>The armed conflicts in the Near Eastern countries of Syria and Lebanon by France have made British Foreign Secretary Eden publicly declare the situation "extremely serious." The Soviet People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs also made an emergency suggestion to the British, American, and French envoys, believing that the armed conflicts between Syria and Lebanon and the French army violated the spirit and principles decided by the Dumbarton Oaks Conference and violated the purpose of the San Francisco United Nations Conference discussing the establishment of an organization to guarantee national peace and security. Obviously, the recent war in the Near East is not only a manifestation of the absurd policies of the French provisional government, but also the so-called United Nations.</p>
<p>Since the First World War, Syria and Lebanon have been under the military control of French imperialism and regarded as French colonies. However, due to the location of Syria and Lebanon, they have long been the objects of contention among European powers. First, this country (before World War II, Lebanon was part of Syria), although a historically ancient civilization, has always been economically and politically backward and corrupt. Coupled with ethnic and religious divisions, the interior is often not unified, causing the great powers to regard it as meat on the chopping board. Second, the country is rich in resources, especially in oil production and the transit of international oil pipelines, holding the main entrepot ports of the eastern Mediterranean, so it is coveted by the great powers. Third, in terms of strategic position, it is the thoroughfare of Eurasian transportation, and has always been a place of contention for British, French, German, and Russian military strategists. Under these conditions, these two countries have long had the name of the gunpowder keg of the Near East.</p>
<p>When World War II broke out, General de Gaulle launched the Syrian War with the support of the United Kingdom. As a result, General Dentz, dispatched by the Vichy government, surrendered, and Syria fell under the control of de Gaulle. At that time, de Gaulle, who was just starting out, in order to appease the people, under the banner of "Free France," allowed Syria and Lebanon to independently establish their own countries. The people of Syria and Lebanon and all ethnic groups in the Near East cheered and celebrated, making General de Gaulle's international reputation grow day by day. Unexpectedly, recently, after de Gaulle returned to Paris, restored France's false name as one of the world's "five powers," he once again revealed his face as a defender of the imperialist system, and his attitude towards Syria and Lebanon suddenly changed. He was unwilling to give up France's special rights in Syria and Lebanon, making the ethnic groups in Syria and Lebanon and the Near East restless.</p>
<p>The main reason for France's change of attitude towards Syria and Lebanon is that, in view of the discussion on the future international security guarantee mechanism in the San Francisco Conference, only the strong are still reasonable, the major powers occupy absolute power, and no sincere agreement has been reached between the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union on the issue of mandated territories and colonies. All of this stimulated the de Gaulle government, which妄想效法英美，霸佔及恢復其在世界的殖民地, and sought to emulate Britain and the United States, occupying and restoring its colonies in the world, starting with Syria and Lebanon, and then restoring France's colonial authority before World War II, that is, the so-called Near East-Indian Ocean-Far East French colonial sphere, and competing with the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>However, in order to protect its Eurasian strategic and economic communication lines, the United Kingdom will never allow France to monopolize Syria and Lebanon, which threaten the center of this communication line, the Suez Canal. Therefore, they also have various activities in Syria and Lebanon. At the same time, Syria and Lebanon, since the transformation of the European situation last year, in order to obtain strong foreign aid, have successively established diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. As the Soviet Union's influence in Southeastern Europe has become widespread, it is happy to provide assistance to Syria and Lebanon, the gateway to the Mediterranean Sea in the Far East and the center of the Near Eastern countries. Under such complex international relations, the sudden incident of the French army on Syria and Lebanon certainly has the power to sensationalize international public opinion.</p>
<p>Now, because Churchill sent a letter of warning to de Gaulle, ordering a ceasefire and troop withdrawal, and ordered the British troops stationed in the Near East to take action as the opportunity arises, and the Soviet Union intervened, the chaos in Syria and Lebanon will probably calm down temporarily; however, the above-mentioned complex factors will only make the situation "more chaotic." In addition, there have recently been conflicts between British troops and Yugoslav troops over the Trieste port garrison issue, as well as Iran's request for the withdrawal of British, American, and Soviet troops. The complexity of the relationships is no less than that of the Syrian and Lebanese issues. Probably the Three Giants Conference cannot resolve it. Under the current situation, Truman is suffering from the increasingly serious social and domestic problems in the United States, and Churchill is facing the critical moment of the Labour Party's bloody battle. Then, even if the Three Giants Conference can be勉强召集 within a short period of time, it is not difficult to predict what the result will be.</p>
<p>Local Correspondence</p>
<h3>A Complete Look at Shenjiang County (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Yu Kun</p>
<p>More than half of the people own their own houses in the county. The number of those who are renting is relatively small. The rent was once calculated in rice, but now it has been converted into cash. In the prosperous areas, the monthly rent for an average two-story house is about 8,000 yuan, and for a bungalow, about 6,000 yuan. In residential areas, the monthly rent is about 4,000 yuan, but a single room costs 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. The people are generally able to support themselves, so the living conditions are still relatively good. However, prices have been rising continuously in recent years, and are affected by the Shanghai market. If people are not exceptionally thrifty and do not work hard to increase production, it will be difficult to maintain this leisurely lifestyle.</p>
<p>In terms of taxes, there are many items. In addition to the national taxes and city taxes that should be levied, there are also exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies, totaling no less than twenty kinds. There is a general feeling that people cannot bear the burden.</p>
<p>Except for rice, which is slightly cheaper, the prices of other goods are also gradually rising. Here are some examples of the prices of various commodities in the local area on the 23rd of this month:</p>
<p>Rice: 150,000 yuan per dan (150 jin); pure oil: 1,500 yuan per jin; vegetable oil: 1,600 yuan per jin; cotton: over 50,000 yuan per dan; salt: 180 yuan per jin; soybeans: 600 yuan per jin; red beans: 700 yuan per jin; chicken eggs: 110 yuan each; meat: 1,300 yuan per jin; tofu: at least 50 yuan; "Tongben" soap: 700 yuan per piece; matches: 120 yuan per box; candles: 700 yuan per stick; large cakes and deep-fried dough sticks: 100 yuan per piece; boiled water: 100 yuan per scoop; raw water (river water): 70 to 100 yuan per dan; bean stalk firewood: 5,000 yuan per dan; rice straw: 3,500 yuan per dan.</p>
<p>Looking at the various prices listed above, except for daily necessities, the rest are cheaper than in Shanghai. In the past, the county's commerce was the best in the country. After several divisions, the prosperous cities and towns were all placed under the jurisdiction of Shanghai. The remaining areas have very quiet commerce. Only Minhang Town is relatively better, followed by Zhuanqiao Town and Maqiao Town. The rest are not worth mentioning. All commercial market conditions are shifted by Shanghai merchants. In the future, with convenient transportation and rapid transport, we can hope for the revitalization of commerce. The county has traditionally been an agricultural area, but in recent years it has become increasingly industrialized. Chimneys stand tall, and factories are everywhere. The most famous products are bricks, tiles, silk fabrics, and yarn, which have low production costs and are well-made, so they sell well throughout the country. After the incident (likely referring to a military or political event), a considerable number of factories have been closed for various reasons. Now only a few small factories remain, and their products primarily are cotton.</p>
<p>As for the financial situation, everything is shifted by Shanghai. Except for two banks and one trust company in Minhang, there are no large-scale financial institutions elsewhere. The Shenjiang Cooperative Branch in Minhang Town has about 16,000 members, but the total funds in the branch are less than one million yuan. Due to improper management, it has suffered losses and is almost exhausted. Recently, the branch decided to increase capital, changing from 60 yuan per household to 1,000 yuan. Regarding agricultural loans, the cooperative has partnered with the Bank of Communications. Initially, the loan was 5,000 yuan per person, but later increased to 20,000 yuan per household. The total loan amount is about 5 million yuan, with a monthly interest rate of only 3%. The drawback is that the time it takes from application to direct lending to farmers is often delayed by several months, which leads to a loss of effectiveness. This fails to meet the urgent needs of farmers. It is hoped that the authorities will improve this situation. The loans are mostly used to purchase fertilizers, seeds, and farm implements.</p>
<p>The main occupation of the county's residents is agriculture, followed by commerce and industry. The number of unemployed vagrants is very small. The most famous relief organization is the Pu'an Hall in Minhang, followed by the Minhang Relief Bureau. Recently, due to a lack of funds, the facilities are crude and simple, so it is difficult for the poor to receive real benefits.</p>
<p>In the county's towns and villages, the streets are narrow and full of dirt. Recognizing this, the city's chamber of commerce and the authorities specifically raised funds in Minhang Town to build public toilets, street lights, and cleaning services. The operating expenses are covered by the sale of excrement from the public toilets to farmers to manage local public health, and the results are excellent. Recently, the municipal government believes that this matter should be under the jurisdiction of the Health Bureau, and specifically appointed the local "Maosheng Cleaning Station" to handle it. Since taking over, it has only sold excrement and has greatly neglected public health, so the appearance of the city is not as good as before. There is a private hospital in Minhang Town with complete facilities, and it is the only Western one. The other towns only have some private</p>
<p>There are only three middle schools and dozens of elementary schools in the county. The county provides a monthly subsidy of 30,440 yuan, any remaining expenses are the city Chamber of Commerce's responsibility to raise and supplement; private schools rely on tuition income, and contributions from the school board.</p>
<p>The tuition fee for a county middle school is 5,000 yuan per person, but it is still felt that they cannot afford it, and private schools are slightly higher. Because tuition fees are expensive, most villagers cannot send their children to school. Based on the current number of school-age children, only 20 to 30% attend school. As for the teachers' salaries, the best is at Cikang Middle School in Tangwan Town, where each teacher receives an average of about one dan of rice per month, which is far different from the county middle school, which pays 200 yuan per hour. Due to the salary differences, the quality of the teachers is also different. The teachers at Cikang Middle School all have at least a high school education, while others are lower. Some even have elementary school graduates working as elementary school teachers. As for the students' level, there is a vast difference between now and then.</p>
<p>When the reporter first arrived in the county, he interviewed the county magistrate, Li Guangyuan, and asked him to announce his recent administrative policies and explain the details. I will briefly record them below:</p>
<p>All administrative reforms are built on a solid foundation of security and economic stability. The county is located in a corner of Shanghai, and security is the top priority. With convenient transportation, economic relief will not be difficult to establish. However, the current situation in all areas is not perfect, so since taking over, I have planned to make reforms.</p>
<p>The county's economy is based on agricultural production. To stabilize people's lives, the only way is to revive the rural economy. The main task is to improve production techniques, so that all crops can be cultivated smoothly to achieve increased production. This measure will also benefit Shanghai's population dispersion efforts.</p>
<p>Improve transportation infrastructure and promote the circulation of goods. The Hu-Min Road is an important transportation artery between the city and the county seat. Since the incident, the road surface has been severely damaged. Recently, with the increasing importance of highway transportation, it is planned that after the busy farming season, the district and town chiefs will be responsible for hiring laborers to repair the road sections in their respective districts within a limited time.</p>
<p>Organize a political work propaganda team to make the general public understand the importance and content of political work and assist the government in moving towards the road to revival together.</p>
<p>Strengthen the Baojia system. Although each district and town has a Baojia organization, it is very rudimentary. In the future, it should be rectified and effectively guided, so that local security can be better ensured.</p>
<p>Prohibit smoking and gambling. Recently, the habit of smoking and gambling has become very prevalent in various villages, especially in Minhang. Although it is not public, it concerns local morality. Therefore, on the June 3rd Anti-Smoking Day, a clean-up campaign to ban smoking was held, including speeches and screenings of the film "Wan Shi Liu Fang" to publicize the harm of smoking, and actively try to suppress various smoking and gambling institutions and gathering places.</p>
<p>Improve the equipment and treatment of educational administration and other public agencies, in order to enhance local public welfare (The End)</p>
<h3>San Francisco Conference Discusses Military Enforcement Measures; Impasse Formed Over Insurance Procedures</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency): San Francisco telegram: With the problems of veto power and the mandate system yet to be resolved, the United Nations Conference is now discussing the military enforcement measures proposed by the Security Council, which is led by five countries. At a meeting of the Implementation Measures Committee last night, an amendment was passed, deciding that France should also attend when Yu, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union hold consultations, and stipulating that during the transition period before the special agreement on the forces of the Security Council comes into effect, joint action should be taken to maintain peace. Regarding the above-mentioned special agreement and its military agreement, some people suspect that only in a world war can the necessary approval of the five countries and the other half of the member states be obtained, so negotiations on the military agreement must actually be delayed until then.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency): According to a San Francisco telegram: The Soviet government's reply on the voting procedure issue of the Security Council did not reach the Soviet representative until the evening of the 1st. Representatives of the five countries, Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, Yu, and France, held a meeting that night. The United States and Britain finally came into direct conflict with the Soviet Union's claims. The meeting ended without any conclusions. The five countries continued to discuss the matter at the meeting, but both sides held their own views and it was difficult to reach an agreement. The final result of the San Francisco Conference will fall into an intractable deadlock. Most small countries follow the claims of Britain and the United States, and needless to say, absolutely oppose the Soviet Union, so the Soviet Union has become isolated. Anxious about the end of the conference, Britain and the United States have repeatedly entrusted future agreements to the voting procedure of the Dumbarton Oaks Conference. However, representatives of small countries believe that voting is the most important provision in the International Organization Act. If this matter is not decided, the entire Organization Act will be meaningless, so they expressed strong opposition, and the United States and Britain are in a dilemma.</p>
<h3>Soviet Newspaper Exposes American Territorial Ambitions</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Swedish Capital, 3rd (Central News Agency): As the world war situation continues to shift, the antagonism between the United States and the Soviet Union has reached a head. According to a Moscow broadcast on the 2nd, American ambitions for Pacific territories were exposed. According to a report from the San Francisco correspondent of the Soviet government's official newspaper "News": The theme of the American Pacific War seems to be like the "colonial heroism" of the British imperialist "Kipling." American citizens, from news magazines and leaflets aimed at soldiers to the statements of political leaders, consistently express such ideas, advocating that the United States must possess Pacific islands. American senators, admirals, or commentators also take the view that the Pacific problem cannot be resolved without this. The United States dreams of winning in the Pacific, believing that it must secure the assets of a large colony.</p>
<h3>Tergol's Speech on the French-Syrian Dispute</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency): According to a Paris telegram: General Tergol announced to a group of reporters yesterday that France is now prepared to participate in the peace conference. However, the convening of this peace conference must not only be to mediate the problems between Syria and Lebanon, but also to involve the entire Eastern Arab disposition.</p>
<p>Bern, 3rd (Central News Agency):</p>
<p>According to reports from Beirut: The Rivanda War has ended, and it is currently in a state before the holding of a conference. Order has also been restored in Damascus. Although there are still British troops patrolling the streets in Beirut, the general public is very quiet. The Lebanese delegation attending the Arab League meeting also left Cairo yesterday due to the change in the Rivanda situation.</p>
<p>Post-War Scene in Damascus City</p>
<p>According to those who have visited Damascus, "The current scene in the Syrian capital is very similar to London, England, after being bombed." He told a Reuters reporter that there was indeed damage and destruction in the area, and there were still flames in the streets. Most of the roads can still be repaired, but a small part must be rebuilt.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Social Welfare Plans to Relieve Air Raid Disasters</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 3rd (Central News Agency): Since taking office, Minister Peng of the Ministry of Social Welfare has been actively strengthening the ministry's affairs, and is planning to universally relieve air raid disasters in order to relieve the victims, because many innocent civilians have been killed and injured in frequent air raids in various places recently. The ministry is trying its best to find ways to cover the expenses.</p>
<h3>Our Chinese People Under American Blind Bombing</h3>
<p>The enemy America attempts to use the Chinese mainland as a battlefield, and indiscriminately bombs innocent Chinese people. In the past, the bombing of Changsha was the most tragic. The picture above shows a major fire in Changsha City after the bombing, and firefighters are working to reduce the fire and rescue people in the flames. The two women on the left and right had their faces injured by shrapnel and moaned in pain. The picture below shows the people who are escaping the bombing with their children and elders. Looking back at their homeland, which has become rubble, they cannot help but feel sad.</p>

<h3>Authorities Negotiate Food Supply Countermeasures; Strictly Prohibit Hoarding and Manipulation; Economic Bureau Director Liu Hopes for Cooperation from All Businessmen and Citizens</h3>
<p>After taking office, the new Director of the Municipal Economic Bureau, Liu Xingchen, decided to follow all central economic laws and promote wartime economic policies. He is particularly concerned about the soaring price of rice and the unreasonable rise in other general prices, and is determined to strictly prohibit them. Yesterday, he specially issued a statement, deeply hoping that all businessmen and citizens in the city will cooperate closely to seek the stability of the market. The statement is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Soaring Rice Prices</p>
<p>A Serious Problem: The current price of rice is a central issue in the city's economy. In recent days, all prices have soared abnormally, especially the price of rice, which has changed several times in an instant, far beyond the usual reason. The reason is that the time between the harvest seasons is too long, transportation is blocked, and the source of supply is not smooth, which has caused anxiety among the citizens. Fearing that rice is not easy to obtain, they rush to buy it. Rice sellers are taking advantage of their psychological anxiety to arbitrarily raise prices, hoping to hoard the commodity. Street talk and alley discussions are full of anxiety. What I see along the way are often people with sunken cheeks and emaciated faces, a heartbreaking sight. If we do not seek relief urgently, the lives of millions of people in Shanghai will be in danger. This is not only an economic problem, but also the most serious social problem. Looking to the future, it is heartbreaking to think about.</p>
<p>Authorities Negotiate</p>
<p>Effective Solutions: I have been ordered to serve as the Director of the Economic Bureau at a time when Shanghai's economy is in a state of chaos. My responsibility is not to be ignored, and I cannot bear to ignore it. Following the instructions of the Mayor and Secretary Wei, I have repeatedly discussed with relevant Allied authorities, and we all believe that the food problem of the citizens of Shanghai is a serious matter. They agreed to provide strong assistance in opening up the source of supply, and will never leave the food supply of millions of citizens in Shanghai unattended. The highest authorities of the municipal government are also negotiating with the highest Allied authorities every day to find effective solutions.</p>
<p>Hoarding for Profit</p>
<p>Punishment According to Law: As for the difficulty of transportation and the lack of materials, this is not just a matter of recent days. Citizens' consumption is the same as before, and the transportation situation is the same as before. Why has the price of rice increased from 100,000 yuan per shi to several times that in just a few days? This is really unreasonable. This must be caused by someone deliberately hoarding for profit. Social stability must be maintained by the common efforts of citizens. No one can be alone in a society where there is unrest. If any hoarding or price manipulation is found, the government will have no hesitation in punishing it according to law. In addition to contacting the Economic Security Office to suppress it, I hope that businessmen and citizens will be self-aware and self-motivated, and not fall into the clutches of the law. I also hope that they will save unnecessary consumption, use miscellaneous grains as substitutes, and get through the time between harvest seasons together. Do not easily believe rumors and frighten each other.</p>
<p>Arbitrary Price Increases</p>
<p>Strict Prohibition: As for the increase in general prices, although there are various reasons, most of them are taking advantage of the opportunity to arbitrarily increase prices, hoping to be opportunistic. No matter what the cost is, it is unreasonable and must be strictly prohibited. Our bureau adheres to economic laws and regulations, and takes implementation as the goal. Under the wartime economic system, general prices must be legal and reasonable. I hope that all businessmen and citizens in the city will cooperate closely and follow the right path together to seek the stability of the market. I cannot help but hope for this.</p>
<h3>Third Phase of Gold Certificates to be Issued Today; 1.25 Million Yuan per Taël</h3>
<p>The third phase of gold certificates issued by the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank will continue to be sold from today (4th) to the 6th. The face value is still divided into three types: one taël, five taëls, and ten taëls. The listed price, after convening various committee members in accordance with recent market conditions, is publicly set at 1.25 million yuan per taël in national currency, which is 420,000 yuan higher than the second phase's selling price of 830,000 yuan. The gold certificates sold in this phase will be redeemed for gold starting on July 5th of this year.</p>

<p>The Municipal Finance Bureau's levy of the spring business tax was approved in response to the requests of various industries to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. The tax is only based on the business volume of January, February, and March of this year, and due to time constraints, it first accepted the work of registration and tax payment. As of now, the bureau has collected a total of about 100 million yuan in spring business tax. As for the preliminary review of the tax declarations of various industries, it is currently being actively promoted. It is also learned that the bureau is now preparing to levy the summer business tax. The implementation period is roughly around the beginning of this month. Once the municipal government's reply is received, it will be officially announced. At that time, the levy of this tax will begin simultaneously in the urban area and the suburban counties. Moreover, the actual business volume of various industries in January and February of this year will be used as the standard for assessing the summer business tax for April, May, and June. At the same time, staff will continue to be sent to various designated areas to investigate whether the spring business tax reported by the various businesses is true.</p>
<h3>Last Week's Financial Market Conditions: Intense Fluctuations</h3>
<p>The city's financial market conditions, amid the changing international situation, have been unstable. The past week has remained fraught with danger. Although the Central Reserve Bank issued gold securities in an attempt to curb high winds, speculative merchants still used loose funds to stir up trouble, spread rumors, incite people's hearts, and manipulate market prices, thereby reaping illegal profits. Raw silk fluctuated sharply within the week, with highs and lows differing by about forty points. Chinese stocks repeatedly saw new highs. The three hottest stocks experienced active ups and downs. Small and medium-sized stocks mostly rose with few declines. Short selling was initially seen on Monday, followed by a rebound on Tuesday afternoon. Wednesday was even higher. On Thursday, due to some unfavorable news for bulls, large and small stocks were sold off together, with cries of selling everywhere, showing a downward trend. Unexpectedly, there was a sudden turnaround on Friday afternoon, and the rise continued in a straight line on Saturday morning, which was beyond general expectations. Silver, public bonds, and various enemy currencies all continued to rise. In terms of industry and commerce, due to increased commodity costs and reduced production, prices have been raised, especially for major commodities related to people's livelihoods, such as rice, miscellaneous grains, oil, sugar, firewood, charcoal, soap, matches, and candles. The price increases were outrageous and endless, and social livelihood became more serious. The price limits approved by the so-called Market Price Evaluation Committee were all secretly raised by more than double, and people from all walks of life eagerly hope that the municipal authorities will take strong measures to suppress prices to alleviate the people's suffering and avoid further delays.</p>
<h3>Academic Association of University Students: Founding Anniversary</h3>
<p>The Academic Research Association of Chinese University Students has been established for one year. Yesterday was the association's first anniversary. All members held a commemorative ceremony at the Majestic Theatre. First, Chairman Wang Qiong delivered the opening speech, followed by a report by the person in charge of the association on the work situation in the past year.

<h3>Naval Baojia 7th District: Air Defense Squad Inspected Yesterday</h3>
<p>The 7th District of the Naval Baojia held a grand inspection of the air defense squad at Kangle Elementary School Plaza on Kangle Road at 10:00 am yesterday. More than 3,000 people attended, including air defense squad members from various groups, female first-aid squad members, and youth corps Baojia teams. Police Inspector Li Hengsheng from the Xihongkou Police Station also attended. Immediately afterwards, an inspection ceremony was held, and District Chief Cai and Police Inspector Li delivered speeches of encouragement.</p>
<p>Letter to the Editor: The Human Rickshaw Pullers' Union wrote to the editor, stating: "We have found that the rickshaw rental was approved by the municipal government on May 29, increasing the original rental price of 950 yuan by 80%, making the daily rental price per vehicle 1,700 yuan. Unexpectedly, your newspaper published on the 2nd of this month: Starting from June 1, the rent will be increased to 4,400 yuan in national currency for a full shift and 2,200 yuan in viewed currency for a half shift, but the car dealers charge 1,700 yuan for a half shift. After reading this, our association immediately inquired with the relevant authorities, and there is no such thing. Therefore, we specially ask your newspaper to grant a correction."</p>

<h3>Alleys and Roads Should Not Be Regarded as Sports Venues</h3>
<p>— Gu Qizhong</p>
<p>Alleys and roads are important passages for public transportation and should maintain order and must not be regarded as sports venues for various games, which hinders public transportation. This is known to everyone.</p>
<p>However, some ignorant students, factory workers, or idlers often play kicking large and small balls on the road. Some even play hard tennis balls on the road. Occasionally, if one is not careful, small amounts of mud will splash on people's clothes, and large amounts of ball force will injure people's bodies. Those who come out to dissuade them are often scolded, and violent people even want to commit murder. Such disputes have been seen repeatedly. The most incomprehensible thing is that the police do not interfere.</p>
<p>One day, when the author was passing Madang Road, a ball suddenly flew towards him. Fortunately, he avoided it quickly and was not hit, but it hit the glasses of a cyclist who was driving behind him. The glasses shattered on the ground, and the woman cried loudly. The woman wanted to chase the perpetrator, but he was already far away. Another day, several people were playing ball on Kangding Road, kicking a ball into a pancake vendor's oil pan. Caught off guard, boiling oil splashed on the vendor's face, and blisters immediately appeared, almost covering his eyes. The vendor screamed in pain and wanted to catch them, but the players scattered. Recently, the city has been manufacturing and selling slingshot toys made of lead wire. Most children also play with slingshots on the road, which not only causes harm to each other but also easily endangers the public. They either shoot people's faces or even injure their eyes. Some naughty children often use vehicles as targets for slingshots. One day, a trolleybus on Daxing Road was speeding westward, and a group of children were playing slingshots, and the things they shot out were mostly sand and soybeans. At that time, it hit the forehead of a traveling vendor in the car, and the passenger was unable to get off the car for a while, and only poked his head out of the window and scolded loudly. Such behaviors have to be said to be hateful.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is hoped that the police stationed on the road will prohibit those who endanger public safety and order, and should not fail to interfere because the matter is small, which will hinder order and cause trouble. At the same time, it is also deeply hoped that teachers will warn their students and parents will discipline their children not to play games on the road or in alleys that obstruct traffic.</p>
<h3>Founding of the Air Defense Training Institute Alumni Association: Grand Ceremony Held Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Air Defense Training Institute Alumni Association of the Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters held its founding meeting at the Dahua Theater on Jing'an Temple Road at 10:00 am yesterday (3rd). Zhou, who is also the Minister (represented by Cao Jingang), representatives from the Shanghai Naval Air Defense Command, the Chief of the Police Defense Department of the Air Defense Headquarters, the Chief of the General Affairs Department, the Deputy Director of the New Chengzhen Branch of the Huangpu Branch, and the honorary presidents of the association Wu and the President Otani Ichisho, as well as more than a thousand members, attended. The police band came to the venue to play music, and the ceremony was grand, and an oath was held.</p>
<p>Presidents</p>
<p>Speech by the President: The President said in his speech, "Today, we are holding the founding meeting, gathering graduates from the three sessions of the Air Defense Training Institute together. The spirit is inspiring, and we are cooperating with each other. I am sincerely gratified. The current situation is becoming increasingly tense. The enemy, Britain and the United States, wants to achieve its aggressive goals and uses various means to attack various parts of Greater East Asia, killing innocent people. At the same time, Greater Shanghai is also the target of its attacks; repeated bombardments have made our air defense mission extremely important. However, the general public in Shanghai still lacks understanding and enthusiasm for air defense. As air defense instructors, all students should assume the important responsibility of guidance and hope that the military, police, and people will work together to complete the air defense mission of Greater Shanghai and protect the safety of Greater Shanghai.</p>
<p>Gu Ji</p>
<p>Wu's Speech Honorary President Gu Wu said in his speech, "Today, we are holding the founding meeting of the alumni association, and all the excellent students are gathered together. This spirit of grasping unity makes me have infinite feelings. I firmly believe that the problems between China and Japan can be very natural, respectful, and cooperative in this harmonious atmosphere. It is comforting to see this. Looking at the fact that Germany and France were incited by ambitious European and American countries and launched struggles, the result was that both were defeated and injured, and they encountered the same fate. We East Asians should wake up. China and Japan are of the same origin and should stand on the same line. The position of our Republic of China is to seek freedom, independence, and survival, and we must follow the will of President Sun and unite with the nations of the world that treat us equally and strive together. Japan is the nation that treats us equally. The invasion policies of Britain and the United States against our country have been thoroughly understood by insightful people. The East does not put the yellow people in their hearts; therefore, without Japan, there is no East Asia, without China, there is no Japan, and without Japan, there is no China. The relationship between China and Japan is extremely close. We should live and die together and cooperate to defend Greater East Asia. Enemy planes have repeatedly attacked Shanghai and killed innocent people. We should strengthen our air defense mission, just like the mission we have rationally recognized. At the same time, the significance of this mission is very great. All our students are voluntary and take the truth of serving society and helping each other as the premise. Therefore, I hope that everyone will unite in spirit and strengthen the air defense mission, and I wish you all good health."</p>
<p>Zhou Bu</p>
<p>Chang's Speech The Chief Secretary Cao Jingang delivered a speech on behalf of Minister Zhou, saying, "Today, we are holding the founding meeting of the Air Defense Training Institute Alumni Association. On behalf of Minister Zhou, I would like to say a few words to the students. Seeing your spirit of unity and vigor, I am infinitely admired. The current situation is becoming increasingly serious. In today's era of scientific advancement, air combat is becoming more and more advanced. Enemy planes are wantonly bombing and killing innocent people. We should strengthen our defense work. Shanghai is the center of China's politics, economy, and culture and is likely to be attacked at any time. The authorities have established the Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters to strengthen the city's air defense work and train outstanding young people as instructors. The graduates of the three sessions are already more than 600 people. Today's founding meeting of the alumni association is the starting point for future work. Please sincerely guide the public with the various skills and academics you have learned, and from now on, develop a new spirit, unite as one, research together, cooperate and help each other, and promote the overall strength, then its effect will be greater. At the same time, we should recognize that Greater Shanghai is our hometown, and we are all members of the city. We should work together with the five million citizens to protect Greater Shanghai. I wish you all good health and a bright future." Subsequently, the Chief of the Police Defense Department, representatives of the Japanese Naval Air Defense Command, and others gave speeches one after another, with many words of encouragement. After the speeches, the founding declaration was read. Finally, the air defense film "Blast and Shrapnel" was shown, which ended at about 12 o'clock.</p>
<p>Founding</p>
<p>Declaration Founding Declaration of the Air Defense Training Institute Alumni Association: The Air Defense Training Institute Alumni Association has been successfully established today with the cooperation and support of the Air Defense Headquarters. From now on, we graduates will have a group organization, and we will use the group's strength to deal with sudden terrorist air raids at any time to minimize the damage suffered by citizens, and we will also use this to exert the great power of our air defense instructors. At the beginning of the establishment of this association, we would like to briefly state the purpose of the organization as follows: First, to improve the efficiency of air defense and increase the public's knowledge of air defense. In the current situation where the war has reached the final stage, the crisis of air raids is imminent. Although the authorities stipulate that the 9th of each month is Air Defense Day, and air defense exercises are widely implemented to arouse the public's vigilance and complete all necessary air defense preparations, so that the public will not panic in times of danger, but in fact, most citizens either do not understand the meaning of air defense and sit idly by, or have not received sufficient training, and although they are determined to defend the air, they suffer from poor skills and cannot exert their abilities. This requires the guidance of our graduates, explaining the advantages and disadvantages, and teaching the skills, so that all residents of the city can know and do everything, so that they will not be unworthy of the name of air defense instructor. However, the strength of individuals is limited, and knowledge and experience are even more insufficient. When implementing work, the methods cannot be perfect, and various obstacles will inevitably arise. If we can work together and consistently, we can solve the difficulties of individuals with the strength of the group, and we have the advice of various leaders, teachers, and elders, which will not only improve personal knowledge but also improve the efficiency of guiding citizens. In other words, there is greater strength to contribute to society. Second, to connect feelings and encourage each other. Although we are strong young people, we have also studied together, and we are all determined to serve the people. Under the banner of air defense, we are united in pace, but we may not be able to work with each other because of the different times of training or the different regions in which we live. There are many people who are not interwoven with each other. Now we can gather together from time to time under the organization of the Alumni Association to encourage and learn from each other, which can not only gather ideas and benefit from each other, but also connect feelings and enhance friendship. The purpose of this association is as described above. Fortunately, all my classmates can deeply understand, practice, and make this association shine, so that leading the citizens can safely survive the great disaster of air raids.</p>
