<p>重慶三日上午一時電　國府九月三日令：抗敵與師，閱時八載，最後勝利，泡非倖致。追維始事以來，我全體將士聞義赴難，朝發夕至，以血肉之驅，當新銳之器，陣地緃成灰燼，軍心仍如金石，前仆後繼，有死無降知有敵則無我，視八年如一日，此種堅毅忠勇之精神，不僅頑敵膽亡，要亦聯盟各國聲應氣求之所自，豐功偉績，永垂不朽。茲者兵氛旣銷，日月重光，湔盡恥辱，還我河山，値此薄海騰歡，舉國同慶之際，緬懷馳驅疆塲，歷年苦戰之勞績，由軍事委員會傳令全體官兵一體優予褒獎，厚爲慰勞，其應如何各按功績分別給賞，以　忠貞而資激　之處，并由該會會同行政院迅爲擬議，詳訂辦法，呈候核奪施行此令。</p>

<h3>國民黨告全國同胞書　盼望一心一德完成建國偉業</h3>
<p>中央社重慶二日電　中國國民黨爲抗戰勝利，吿全國同胞書，全文如次：</p>
<p>全國同胞們！當此抗戰勝利，全國騰歡，想能記憶國父一句名言「夫事有順乎天理，應乎人情，適乎世界之潮流，合乎人　之需要，而爲先知先覺者所決志行之，則斷無不成者，此古今革命維新興邦建國等事業是也」。</p>
<p>國父遺敎如響斯應</p>
<p>這句話在勝利的今日，固覺得如　斯應。論建國的前途，更好是耳提面命，首先是本黨遵照國父遣教，領導國民革命，爭取中國下獲得成功，而在這一成功之中，確巳實現了「日本即欲實行其侵略政策，中國人亦必出而拒絕之，即不幸中國爲日本所佔領，不論何時何處，亦斷非日本所能統治而有利」的遺敎，更實現了「民國以前吾黨本主義以建立民國，民國以後則本主義以捍衛民國」的遺敎。國父曾指出「吾黨實聚中國之存亡，使吾黨弛而不張，則中國或幾乎息」。五十年革命歷史，八年餘抗戰紀錄，都說明了本黨的努力奮鬥，與中國存亡實有不可分亂的關係，但國父也指出國民革命是國民之事，人人應負革命之責，我同胞今後自更當記取國父的敎導，自強不息，爲建國大業成功的保證。</p>
<p>三民五權立國極則</p>
<p>其次，國父創立的三民主義·五權憲法，實爲立國的極則·政制的宏規。今不平等條約取消，日本帝國主義覆滅，民族主義中「中國民族自求解放」一個目的，巳完全達到，其第二個目的「國內各民族一律平等」，亦可遵奉遣敎及六全大會決議促共澈底實現。尙待迅速策進的，即是最進步的民主政治，最適宜的經濟建設，此爲本黨目前最急的任務，亦爲本黨始終一貫的決心，誓當與我同胞一心一德，再接再厲，使民權主義能在最短期間完全實行，民生主義亦能定期成功。五十年來本黨與全國同胞共同奮鬥，雖已推翻了二百數十年滿淸的統治，結束了五千年的專制，掃蕩了大小軍閥的割據，取消了一百年的不平等條約，打敗了侵略世界的日本帝國主義，但本黨決不因此躊躇滿志。相反的，適與同胞和友邦加深其懲前毖後之念，務使世界的永久和平，獲得確實保障。於民權主義民生主義的最大力量之中，使一切爲民所有，爲民所治，爲民所享，內以安慰我革命先烈與抗戰犧牲的軍民，外以鞏固全人類互利互助共存共榮的基礎。</p>
<p>總裁决策挽救危亡</p>
<p>再次，革命維新興邦建國成功的前提，厥在先知先覺者揆情度理，決志進行。國父旣由此倡率同胞，共成開國之功，本黨總　亦將由此輔導同胞，北成建國之機。九一八前，本黨總裁承負重任，宏濟艱難，固巳爲我同胞所熟知。九一八事變旣起，便鄭重決定禦侮救亡的國策，忍受與論的職責，堅拒敵人的誘　，抱最後犧牲的決心，爲和平最大的努力，並爲抗戰最要的準備。及七七事變一起，便認定這本事變的發展，不僅是中國的存亡問題，亦將是世界人類禍福之所　，立即號召全國，抱定犧牲一切的決心，誓與日本抗戰到底，以爭取最後的勝利。其後首都淪陷，即確定抗戰建國同時並進的國策，進行機動的持久的戰略，粉碎了日本速戰速決與速和速結的企圖，其明效大　，一如粉碎了九一八前日本出兵濟南，阻　北伐的陰謀，與九一八後日本反對國聯顧問的毒計。及德國爆發歐戰，國際形勢詭變，全國危疑震撼，又重申一貫不變的抗戰立塲，並斷定最後的勝利，仍必屬於反侵略的國家。及日本侵略海南島，又立即指出「這是太平洋的九一八，促使友邦警戒，日本旣爆發太平洋戰爭，便命將出師，與盟國並肩作戰，並主張建立世界安全機構。（未完待續）</p>

<h3>The Allied Forces' Eight Hundred Aircraft Stage a Final Demonstration: Japan Formally Surrenders Yesterday; Shigemitsu and Umezu, as Plenipotentiary Representatives, Sign the Instrument of Surrender</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd — The signing ceremony for the surrender agreement between the Japanese government and the Allied Powers was held at 9:00 AM on the deck of the American battleship "Missouri," anchored six miles off Yokohama. The signing venue was set up on the starboard upper deck. From around 8:15 AM, representatives from various Allied nations entered the venue one after another. At 8:40 AM, General of the Army Douglas MacArthur, Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers, and Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, representing the United States, entered the venue, and all preparations were completed. In the center of the venue was a rectangular table, eight feet long and two feet wide. Around the table, facing forward, were the plenipotentiary representatives of China, Great Britain, the Soviet Union, Australia, Canada, France, the Netherlands, and New Zealand, standing in order on the left side. On the right side stood General MacArthur, Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers, along with the American representatives and approximately sixty American staff members, lined up in rows. At 8:50 AM, the Japanese plenipotentiary representatives arrived alongside the "Missouri" on a small boat. Subsequently, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu and Chief of the General Staff Umezu, the two Japanese plenipotentiary representatives, along with nine staff members, also arrived. At exactly 9:00 AM, the signing ceremony commenced, presided over by General MacArthur. Two copies of the surrender agreement, each approximately 1.5 feet long and 1 foot wide, were placed in the center of the table. The Japanese government's plenipotentiary representatives then stepped into the venue, with Shigemitsu and the naval representative in the front, arranged in three rows. After exchanging greetings with the representatives of various countries, they followed General MacArthur's instructions. First, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu signed both documents, followed by Chief of the General Staff Umezu. After they finished, the Allied representatives signed, starting with Supreme Commander General MacArthur, then U.S. Representative Admiral Nimitz, followed by Chinese Representative General Xu Yongchang, Minister of Military Operations; British Representative General Bruce Fraser; Soviet Representative Lieutenant General Kuzma Derevyanko; Australian Representative General Thomas Blamey; Canadian Representative Lieutenant General Ernest S. Leese; French Representative General Marie-Pierre Koenig; Dutch Representative Admiral Conrad Helfrich; and New Zealand Representative Air Vice-Marshal Leonard Isitt, in that order. At 9:15 AM, both sides completed signing. The Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces then handed one copy of the surrender agreement to the Japanese side. Shigemitsu, Umezu, and their staff members then departed from the "Missouri." Thus, the signing ceremony of the surrender agreement came to an end.</p>
<p>A Sketch of the Solemn Ceremony in Twenty-Two Minutes</p>
<p>Associated Press dispatch from the American battleship "Missouri" in Tokyo Bay, 2nd — Silent Japanese officials, during a solemn twenty-two-minute ceremony, unconditionally surrendered the Japanese Empire to the Allied Nations. Under the silent guns of the battleship, representatives of the Allied nations quickly signed the Japanese instrument of surrender, with a black cover, and the English instrument of surrender, with a gold and green cover. As the ceremony proceeded smoothly, over eight hundred Allied warplanes soared through the air, demonstrating the Allied air power one last time. General MacArthur calmly and solemnly presided over the opening ceremony, delivering a brief speech. Japanese representative Shigemitsu Kio moved forward with the aid of a wooden leg (his leg was injured in an explosion in Shanghai thirteen years ago during the January 28th Incident). The enemy envoy took a fountain pen from his pocket, looked at one watch, then another, and took out his pen. When he attempted to sign, he discovered it was out of ink. He finally signed with a pen borrowed from the American representative. General MacArthur frowned, while Shigemitsu remained expressionless. Then, Japanese representative Yoshijirō Umezu adjusted his horn-rimmed glasses and quickly signed on behalf of the Imperial Japanese General Headquarters. General MacArthur also signed, still wearing the informal hat with gold braid that he wore when returning across the Pacific and on the beaches. He signed on behalf of all the Allied nations. Representatives from China, Great Britain, the Soviet Union, Australia, Canada, France, the Netherlands, and New Zealand signed in succession. General MacArthur solemnly walked to the microphone and declared, "Let us pray that peace be now restored to the world, and that God will preserve it always. These proceedings are closed."</p>
<p>Japanese Territory to be Reduced to the Four Main Islands as Stipulated</p>
<p>Around 10:00 AM today (Tokyo time), Japanese territory, under the terms of the Potsdam Declaration, has been reduced to the four main islands and a few other small islands that the Allies will permit them to retain. The Japanese government, the Emperor, and industry are now under MacArthur's control until Japan is allowed to join the world organization planned by the San Francisco Conference. Shigemitsu stood leaning on his cane. When the ceremony was completed, he helped receive the surrender documents. The Japanese representatives pointed out an error in the signature of Canadian representative Cosgrave, which was quickly resolved in consultation between MacArthur's chief of staff and the Japanese representatives. Observers of the ceremony included several individuals who had experienced the attack on Pearl Harbor, the battles of Manila, Singapore, and Hong Kong. Following MacArthur was U.S. General Jonathan Wainwright, who had defended the Philippines, British General Percival, who had been in command in Singapore, Halsey of the U.S. Second Fleet, Stilwell, who had fought in Burma, and twenty other officials. When MacArthur went forward to sign, he asked Wainwright and Percival, who had been held prisoner by the Japanese for a long time, "Will you come forward and sign with me?" MacArthur showed a slight hint of excitement, and his hand trembled slightly when he held the first of the five pens he used. However, he steadied himself at the start of the first character and gifted the pen to Wainwright. After using the second pen, he gifted it to Percival. He then took turns using the other three pens, quickly completing the signing. These three pens will be distributed to important figures of the Allied nations. Shigemitsu and Umezu left the Missouri about half an hour after boarding the ship. The two bowed farewell to more than thirty foreign dignitaries, forty senior army officers, fifty naval officers, Allied journalists, photographers, crew members perched high up (some as high as the crow's nest), and 238 liberated prisoners of war.</p>
<p>Key Points of the Japanese Instrument of Surrender</p>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from the USS Missouri, sent by an Associated Press reporter aboard the ship, 2nd — The Japanese instrument of surrender was signed at 10:00 AM on September 2nd. The key points are as follows: We, by command of and in behalf of the Emperor of Japan, the Japanese Government and of the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters, hereby accept the provisions set forth in the declaration issued on July 26, 1945 at Potsdam by the heads of the governments of the United States, China, and Great Britain, which the Soviet Union has subsequently adhered to. We hereby proclaim the unconditional surrender to the Allied Powers of the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters and of all Japanese armed forces and all armed forces under Japanese control wherever situated. We hereby command all Japanese forces wherever situated and the Japanese people to cease hostilities forthwith, to preserve and avoid damage to all ships, aircraft, and military and civil property, and to obey all orders of the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers and all orders issued by or</p>
<h3>Kuomintang's Letter to the Compatriots of the Entire Nation: Hoping for Unity of Purpose to Accomplish the Great Task of National Construction</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd: The Chinese Kuomintang, for the victory of the War of Resistance, issues a letter to the compatriots of the entire nation. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>Compatriots of the entire nation! At this moment of victory in the War of Resistance, when the whole nation is rejoicing, it is hoped that you can recall a famous saying of the Founding Father: "If a matter is in accordance with heavenly principles, accords with human sentiments, fits the trend of the world, meets the needs of the people, and is determined and carried out by those who are wise and perceptive, then there is absolutely no way it will not succeed. This applies to the revolutionary, reformist, nation-building, and state-founding undertakings of all ages."</p>
<p>The Founding Father's Teachings Resoundingly Echo</p>
<p>This saying, in today's victory, is indeed felt to be resoundingly echoed. Speaking of the prospects for national construction, it is even more of an ear-to-ear admonishment. First and foremost, this party, in accordance with the Founding Father's teachings, leads the national revolution, striving for China to achieve success. And within this success, it has indeed realized the Founding Father's teaching that "Even if Japan wants to implement its policy of aggression, the Chinese people must stand up and reject it. Even if China is unfortunately occupied by Japan, no matter when or where, Japan will never be able to rule it for its own benefit." It has also realized the Founding Father's teaching that "Before the Republic, our party based its principles on establishing the Republic; after the Republic, we base our principles on defending the Republic." The Founding Father once pointed out, "Our party truly gathers the life and death of China. If our party is relaxed and not vigilant, then China may almost cease to exist." Fifty years of revolutionary history and more than eight years of War of Resistance records all demonstrate that the party's efforts and struggles are inextricably linked to China's survival. However, the Founding Father also pointed out that the national revolution is the matter of the nation, and everyone should bear the responsibility of revolution. My compatriots, from now on, should even more remember the Founding Father's teachings, constantly strive for self-improvement, and guarantee the success of the great task of national construction.</p>
<p>The Three Principles of the People and Five-Power Constitution are the Ultimate Principles of Nation-Building</p>
<p>Secondly, the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution, created by the Founding Father, are truly the ultimate principles of nation-building and the grand blueprint for the political system. Now that the unequal treaties have been abolished and Japanese imperialism has been destroyed, the first goal of nationalism, "The Chinese nation seeks its own liberation," has been completely achieved. Its second goal, "All ethnic groups within the country are equal," can also be thoroughly realized by following the teachings of the Founding Father and the resolutions of the Sixth National Congress. What remains to be rapidly promoted is the most progressive democratic politics and the most suitable economic construction. This is the party's most urgent task at present, and it is also the party's consistent determination. We vow to work with our compatriots, with one heart and one mind, to make unremitting efforts so that the Principle of Democracy can be fully implemented in the shortest possible time, and the Principle of Livelihood can also be successfully achieved on schedule. Over the past fifty years, this party has struggled together with the compatriots of the entire nation. Although we have overthrown the rule of the Qing Dynasty for over two hundred years, ended the five thousand years of autocracy, swept away the separatist rule of large and small warlords, abolished the hundred years of unequal treaties, and defeated the Japanese imperialists who invaded the world, this party will never become complacent because of this. On the contrary, we will deepen the lessons learned from the past with our compatriots and friendly nations, and ensure that the world's lasting peace is truly guaranteed. Within the greatest strength of the Principle of Democracy and the Principle of Livelihood, we will make everything owned by the people, governed by the people, and enjoyed by the people. Internally, we will console our revolutionary martyrs and the military and civilians who sacrificed themselves in the War of Resistance. Externally, we will consolidate the foundation of mutual benefit, mutual assistance, common existence, and common prosperity for all mankind.</p>
<p>The Commander-in-Chief's Decisions Saved the Nation from Peril</p>
<p>Thirdly, the prerequisite for the success of revolution, reform, nation-building, and state-founding lies in the wise and perceptive assessing the situation, reasoning, and making resolute decisions. The Founding Father already led his compatriots in this way to jointly achieve the founding of the nation. The Party's Commander-in-Chief will also guide his compatriots in this way to complete the opportunity for national construction. Before the September 18th Incident, the Party's Commander-in-Chief shouldered heavy responsibilities and overcame difficulties, which was already well-known to my compatriots. When the September 18th Incident occurred, he solemnly decided on the national policy of resisting aggression and saving the nation, enduring the responsibilities of public opinion, firmly rejecting the enemy's temptations, embracing the determination to make the final sacrifice, making the greatest efforts for peace, and making the most necessary preparations for the War of Resistance. When the July 7th Incident occurred, he recognized that the development of this incident was not only a matter of China's survival but also the fate of the world and mankind. He immediately called on the entire nation to embrace the determination to sacrifice everything and vow to resist Japan to the end to win the final victory. Afterwards, when the capital fell, he determined the national policy of advancing the War of Resistance and national construction simultaneously, carrying out mobile and protracted strategies, and shattering Japan's attempts at a quick war and a quick settlement. Its obvious effect was as great as shattering Japan's conspiracy to send troops to Jinan before the September 18th Incident to obstruct the Northern Expedition and the poison scheme of Japan opposing the League of Nations advisors after the September 18th Incident. When Germany broke out in the European War, the international situation became treacherous, and the whole country was shaken by suspicion and doubt, he reiterated the consistent and unchanging position of resistance and determined that the final victory would still belong to the anti-aggression countries. When Japan invaded Hainan Island, he immediately pointed out, "This is the 'September 18th' of the Pacific," prompting friendly nations to be vigilant. After Japan launched the Pacific War, he ordered his generals to dispatch troops to fight alongside the Allied forces and advocated the establishment of a world security organization.

A representative meeting is held once every day at 11:00 AM, where representatives from various agencies exchange information and discuss important matters. It was resolved yesterday that if there are any illegal actions by military agencies or units, they should be handed over to the respective agencies for handling as a principle. Other units of unknown origin should be handed over to the fifth section (military law) of this office for handling. Major incidents will be assisted by the military police and the Zongjiujun Action Headquarters. Regarding the issuance of gun licenses, all self-defense firearms of the current police station that have been approved by this office will not be issued. The issuance of gun licenses will still be handled by the current police station, but must be approved by this office. The sample of gun licenses from agencies and units that have been registered and permitted by the two public offices has been notified and sent to the office to facilitate reference during dispatch and inspection duties. Regarding the forced occupation of civilian houses, the arrest of criminals, and the extortion of materials by any unit, the people may immediately report to the military police or this office, and they will be investigated and dealt with at any time, and will never be tolerated. At this time when the national army has not yet arrived and local order has not yet been restored, the authorities are determined to do their duty and do their best to maintain order. However, this matter is of great importance and requires all citizens to plan together and exert their strength to assist."</p>

<p>The Shanghai Military Police issued a notice yesterday: "It has been investigated that the mission of our team stationed in Shanghai is to maintain local order and ensure public security. Recently, it has been found that some people have sealed enemy [blank] houses without orders, which is absolutely wrong. The central supreme authorities of our country have appropriate measures for the disposal of enemy and puppet properties. Before orders are received, it is a violation of the meaning of protecting civil rights to act recklessly. Even the houses currently occupied by our team were empty and unoccupied before our team took them over. In addition to assisting various agencies when they request temporary assistance, our team has never sealed any houses outside. If there are any bad elements who falsely use the name of our team to swagger outside and seal houses without authorization, we hope that the citizens will quickly report to our team, and our team will severely punish them according to the law."</p>

<p>You have always been residents of Shanghai and have made great contributions to the prosperity and development of this city. Now that the war has ended, I hope that you will continue to uphold the spirit of assistance and continue to have close and friendly cooperation with the people of this city to build a new and more [blank] and glorious Shanghai for the new and emerging Republic of China.</p>
<p>At present, I will do my best to assist in solving all the difficult problems that you feel, and all matters can be entrusted to the leader of the concentration camp or [blank] Major [blank] for handling.</p>

<h3>Representative Chiang Negotiates Protection for the Institute of Natural Sciences</h3>
<p>The Institute of Natural Sciences, located by Maple Forest Bridge in this city, was jointly operated by China and Japan. Its equipment was considered quite complete. After Shanghai fell and the National Army retreated westward, the institute came under the sole management of the Japanese. However, it was still able to maintain a spirit of scientific independence, free from any political interference. The puppet organization in Nanjing repeatedly hoped to send people to participate, but was rejected by the institute. Since the realization of victory, the Ministry of Education has been extremely concerned about the current situation of the institute and telegraphed Representative Chiang, entrusting him to find ways to maintain it. After receiving the telegram, Representative Chiang sent personnel to contact the institute. According to Director Sato, the person in charge of the institute, the institute is currently still under the protection of the Japanese army. When the Japanese army withdraws, it will contact our government at any time for handover, requesting protection. As for the property, instruments, etc., they will all be maintained in good condition, and there is a property inventory, which can be handed over at any time after the official receiving agency arrives. After receiving the report, Representative Chiang has telegraphed the Ministry of Education for verification.</p>
