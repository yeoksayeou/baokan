<h3>新聞檢查</h3>
<p>— 成</p>
<p>上海市新聞檢查處成立了，對於報紙，今天起開始檢查。</p>
<p>在我們新聞工作者的立塲，很希望有一個合理而優良的檢查制度。因爲新聞工作者對於所發表的文字，有時或許偏於主觀情緒，雖非故意，但難免與當局的方針或有出入。有了檢査機構，經過了客觀的分析，即可指示改正，不致與當局的方針不相符合了。</p>
<p>所以，檢査工作者與新聞工作者，實際上是處於相輔相成的同等地位的。我們只有一點希望，就是担任實際檢査工作者，必須瞭解檢査標準的原則，而能活用，是指正的態度，而不是求疵的態度。那末，我們相信檢査工作者與新聞工作者必能打成一片，而有裨於整個新聞事業。</p>
<h3>「流民」兩年（下）</h3>
<p>— 顏弗</p>
<p>過不盡的冬日，依然很快地消逝，想念起數千里外的家，增加不少悵惘</p>
<p>去年四月間，又得我N弟的死耗，這使我精神上受了莫大苦痛，每想念起他，我眞怎地悔恨不應携他投到這離家千里的都市來，在這驚濤駭浪里爲那點點的生活而被犧牲了喲。</p>
<p>每在獨個兒的時候，幽蘭的夜里，我從記億里諷誦那悲涼的；「祭十二郞文！」或「祭妹文！」這稍能抒我心頭哀恨！</p>
<p>「生而影不與吾形相依，死而魂不與吾夢相接！」</p>
<p>「除吾死外，當無見期，吾又不知何日死，可以見汝，而死後之有知無知，與得見不得見，又卒難明也！……抱此無涯之憾，天手，人乎！……」唸到這幽幽的句子，我辛酸的淚悄悄的流落　畔，這種境况呀，把我整個的生命都萎靡下來啊。</p>
<p>我再希望什麼呢？用我最大的努力能再和N弟重見一面嗎？茍活世上緃使能獲取光明，然而我的光明是有黑點了。</p>
<p>天天繼續劈劈拍拍的織着草包，從春天至冬天，早晨至夕暮，永永遠遠。我覺這些工作太輕了，我憎惡它不够煩重，不够刻苦，我要過比目前還要若干百萬倍的牛馬生活，要給鞭策着使我透不過氣來，使我對人生厭惡—無所留戀，不要給我絲毫的希望，這樣，我的心才覺得輕鬆些吧。</p>
<p>因此我許會忘記一切，會忘去N弟的死，或更會覺他的死是永遠的安息，反而是幸運地擺脫人生的桎梏。</p>
<p>可是，月前所長調我做別的工作，生活比前好些，天天又與這文縐縐的字多接近了，我很感謝所長的提拔，然而心頭的滋味，又向誰訴。</p>
<p>我想我終有一天離開這兒，常我離開這兒的一天呵！我先要上N弟的　前，傾訴我們別後的事物，　世間殘忍的故事，或天堂里也有的悲哀的故事</p>
<p>我　　着跌失的步伐，帶着一個沒靈魂的軀壳，茍活於世上，縱使能得到光明，然而我的光明是有黑點了。（完）</p>
<h3>青天白日</h3>
<p>— 杜塞</p>
<p>戰爭拖延到八年之久，我們試望青天，依然是那麼澄淸；再望白日，也依然是那麽圓圓的一輪，發揮它的光芒，予人們以新生的活力；可是，我們且俯下頭來望望地上，啊！那　滿着的全是忠勇的戰士們底熱血呵！</p>
<p>熱血是紅色的，紅得那麽刺目！令人想起戰爭的殘酷！</p>
<p>然而，沒有我們勇敢的戰士們在大地上染上了熱血，我們還能重看到這靑的天和白的日嗎？不！決不！也許我們早巳被死神　去，或是給侵略者幽閉在地獄里，永遠見不到（靑）天（白）日！</p>
<p>所以，懸掛國旗的意義，在慶祝之外，我們更應該對忠勇地爲祖國大地流過熱血的戰士們遍致最敬禮，以紀念着他們不朽的豐功偉績！因爲國旗的顏色正是靑（天）白（日）（滿地）紅三色的合滙，牠象徽着：自由平等和博愛！</p>

The association's president, Iuesaburo, issued a statement, ordering all members to abide by the consistent spirit of the association for the past thirty years, to stay in their respective positions, and to contribute silently to Japan's reconstruction. Inoue pointed out that the entire Japanese nation must endure any future national difficulties and should prepare to endure what others cannot endure. He also ordered all members not to take reckless actions or make reckless statements.</p>
<h3>German Rocket Weapons Displayed in Coffins</h3>
<p>Washington News Agency, London, August 31st: A military reporter from the Evening Standard telegraphed from Germany that the Germans were hiding a secret conspiracy for rocket weapons. He stated that six coffins had been unearthed, containing diagrams and photographic plates of the new weapons. A priest who presided over the six coffins and a carpenter who delivered wreaths were extremely surprised by this discovery. The conspiracy was designed so meticulously that even minor events during the funeral were taken into account. If Dr. Wassili, who handled the entire incident, had not confessed, it would have been difficult to discover.</p>
<h3>UN Executive Committee Holds Secret Meeting; Gu Weijun Extends Hospitality to Various Representatives</h3>

<h3>Post-War Tokyo Pilgrimage: A Scene of Devastation and Desolation</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 31st – Reuters correspondent Mr. Lutz, dispatched to Tokyo, sent a telegram yesterday describing his first impressions of post-war Tokyo. Mr. Lutz was among the first group of American soldiers and four journalists to arrive in Japan, landing at Atsugi Airfield. He described, "This morning, as I traveled along the roads between Tokyo and Yokohama, I briefly saw the bombed-out Japanese Imperial Palace. The ground in Tokyo and Yokohama is scorched by bomb blasts, but compared to Germany, the horrifying scenes in Berlin are far worse than in these two cities. The right side of the famous Imperial Hotel in Tokyo, which was not toppled by the great earthquake of 1923, has been destroyed by bombs, but the interior of the hotel remains intact and has electricity and water. Such a sight would be considered a miracle in Berlin. Streetcars in various districts of Tokyo are still running, but most of the residential areas are scarred and bridges are generally passable. The damage suffered by Japan is not absolute devastation. Of all the residents in Tokyo, approximately four million have evacuated to other places, and those remaining in the city have become homeless wanderers, most of them poorly clothed. Our super fortresses, bombers, and fighter planes fly frequently overhead, and the general Japanese public looks up at them, some with an expression akin to those in concentration camps. The city has a sense of quiet solitude."</p>
<h3>Hardships of Life: Shortage of Clothing and Food</h3>
<p>A group of seven reporters from the Associated Press arrived here on the 7th, and the scene in the capital of Japan is bleak. American reporters traveled freely today without obstruction. The contrast between the great Chinese city of Shanghai, which the reporter witnessed yesterday, and Tokyo after the bombing is stark. Shanghai was hardly bombed, while Tokyo has become a pile of ruins. Although the destructive power of the U.S. Air Force is a strange monument, the residents of the city do not seem to react to the first American people to arrive. Most Japanese people who met with reporters seem to be weary of the war, and the general public also has no reaction. When asked for help, they come forward with some hesitation. A certain Japanese politician was an exception, rushing to the Imperial Hotel reception room to tell me, "I am very pleased to meet you. I have never expressed support for this war." As the reporter drove out of the suburbs of Tokyo on the first trip on a path soaked with the ashes of the celebration of the ashes, Japanese children waved and cheered at us, but middle-aged people were not so enthusiastic. The food supply here is extremely poor, and the food at the Imperial Hotel, which is supposed to be the best in Japan, is also unpalatable. There are very few streetcars in the city and even fewer buses. Burned vehicles can be seen everywhere. The train between Yokohama and Tokyo is still running, but Tokyo's main eastern station has been destroyed. Pedestrians on the road seem healthy, but their clothing is not adequate. Japanese ladies are no longer as they were before the war, wearing only ordinary clothes.</p>
<h3>A Collection of Brief News</h3>
<p>Chongqing, 31st (Central News Agency) – According to a telegram from the U.S. News Service in Yokosuka on the 31st, citing a report from the Associated Press, the U.S. Navy authorities have warned the Navy and Marines not to insult the Japanese people during the occupation period. The instructions state: "All officers must maintain solemnity and courtesy in their treatment of the Japanese people and in any speech mentioning Japan. To speak of the Japanese people's national customs or individuals with insulting words is unbecoming of a naval officer."</p>
<p>Chongqing, 31st (Central News Agency) – According to a telegram from the U.S. News Service aboard a warship in Tokyo on the 29th, Nimitz said today that the lack of hostile behavior from the Japanese people during the Allied landing is due to the Allied nations retaining the Emperor. The wisdom of the Potsdam Declaration allowing the existence of the Emperor has been proven by the peaceful and smooth landing currently underway.</p>
<p>Atsugi Airfield, 31st (United Press International) – A reporter from the Domei News Agency, Kato, told American reporters that there are still a few Kamikaze attack personnel in Japan, but the memory is about to disappear. Kato, who was a Domei correspondent in Washington D.C. when the war broke out, said that the Japanese Imperial Government has almost completely disarmed all Kamikaze attack teams, and the occupation is not expected to encounter any major difficulties. The main actions that may cause danger have been monitored, and the Japanese secret police have been disbanded. It is true that many officials in the Imperial Palace have committed collective suicide, and hundreds of ordinary people throughout Japan have committed suicide.</p>
<p>Chongqing, 31st – According to a broadcast from Tokyo on the 31st, after the Allied occupation forces entered Yokohama yesterday, they immediately reached an understanding with the Kanagawa Prefecture police authorities and established ten checkpoints around their garrison area, located at the police stations at the foot of ten bridges, with one end guarded by the Allied forces. The Allied forces will inspect all suspicious persons.</p>

As of yesterday, there were still more than 5,000 tons of coal in stock, which can last for about a month. Regarding the registration of employees of the two railways, it is currently being handled in four locations: Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, and Changzhou. Registration offices are attached to the stations. The Changzhou area has completed processing. The Shanghai area is divided into two registration locations: new employees are at the North Railway Station, and old employees are registering at the Jiaotong Bank on Jing'an Temple Road.</p>

<h3>News Censorship</h3>
<p>--- Cheng</p>
<p>The Shanghai News Censorship Office has been established, and censorship of newspapers begins today.</p>
<p>From the perspective of us news workers, we very much hope that there will be a rational and good censorship system. Because news workers may sometimes be biased toward subjective emotions in the articles they publish, and although it is not intentional, it is inevitable that there will be discrepancies with the authorities' policies. With a censorship mechanism, after objective analysis, it can be pointed out for correction so that it does not conflict with the authorities' policies.</p>
<p>Therefore, censors and news workers are actually in an equal position of mutual support. We only have one hope, and that is that those who are actually responsible for censorship must understand the principles of the censorship standards and be able to use them flexibly. It should be an attitude of pointing out errors, not an attitude of fault-finding. Then, we believe that censors and news workers will be able to work together as one and contribute to the entire news industry.</p>
<h3>"Refugees" for Two Years (Part 2)</h3>
<p>--- Yan Fu</p>
<p>The endless winter days still passed quickly, and thinking of home thousands of miles away added to a lot of melancholy.</p>
<p>Last April, I received news of the death of my younger brother N, which caused me great pain in my mind. Every time I think of him, I truly regret that I shouldn't have brought him to this city thousands of miles away from home, to be sacrificed for that bit of life in this turbulent sea.</p>
<p>Whenever I was alone, on quiet nights, I recited from memory the mournful; "Sacrifice to Twelfth Brother Article!" or "Sacrifice to Sister Article!" This can slightly relieve the sorrow in my heart!</p>
<p>"Living, my shadow does not stay by my side, dying, my soul does not meet in my dreams!"</p>
<p>"Apart from my death, there will be no time to meet. I do not know when I will die, that I may see you, and whether I will know or not know after death, and whether I can see you or not see you, is difficult to understand! ... Embracing this boundless regret, Heaven's hand, or man's! ..." Reading these quiet sentences, my bitter tears quietly fell by my side. This situation has made my whole life wither.</p>
<p>What else do I hope for? Can I see my younger brother N again with my best effort? Even if I can gain light by living in this world, my light has a black spot.</p>
<p>I continue to weave straw bags day after day, from spring to winter, from morning to evening, forever and ever. I feel that these tasks are too light, and I hate that they are not troublesome enough, not hard enough. I want to live a life a million times harder than the current life of a beast of burden, to be whipped so that I can't breathe, so that I hate life - with nothing to miss, and don't give me any hope. This way, my heart will feel a little lighter.</p>
<p>Therefore, I will forget everything, forget the death of my younger brother N, or rather feel that his death is eternal rest, and it is fortunate to get rid of the shackles of life.</p>
<p>However, the director transferred me to another job a month ago, and life is better than before. Every day I am getting closer to these complicated words again. I am very grateful for the director's promotion, but who can I tell the taste in my heart to?</p>
<p>I think I will leave here one day. On the day I leave here, I will first go to my younger brother N's grave to tell him about the things after we parted, the cruel story of the world, or the sad story that also exists in heaven.</p>
<p>I stagger with lost steps, carrying a soulless body, living in the world. Even if I can get light, my light has a black spot. (The End)</p>
<h3>Blue Sky White Sun</h3>
<p>--- Du Se</p>
<p>The war has dragged on for eight years. We try to look at the blue sky, and it is still so clear; we look at the white sun again, and it is still so round, shining its light and giving people new vitality; but let's look down at the ground, ah! It's covered with the hot blood of loyal and brave soldiers!</p>
<p>Hot blood is red, so red that it is dazzling! Reminding people of the cruelty of war!</p>
<p>However, without our brave soldiers staining the earth with hot blood, could we see this blue sky and white sun again? No! Never! Perhaps we would have long been robbed by the god of death, or imprisoned by the invaders in hell, never seeing the (blue) sky (white) sun!</p>
<p>Therefore, the meaning of hanging the national flag is that, in addition to celebrating, we should also pay the highest respect to the soldiers who have shed hot blood for the motherland, to commemorate their immortal achievements! Because the color of the national flag is a combination of blue (sky), white (sun), and (red earth), it symbolizes: freedom, equality, and fraternity!</p>
