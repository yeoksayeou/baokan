<h3>日航空部隊攻擊戰果　擊沉敵艦計十艘　敵機被擊落達一百八十架　日大本營發表</h3>
<p>東京二十三日中央社電日大本營二十三日下午四時發表：（一）據其後之調查，三月十八日至二十一日之間，日航空部隊攻擊敵機動部隊之綜合戰果，已確認者如下：擊沉正規航空母艦五艘，戰艦一艘，巡洋艦三艘，艦種不詳者一艘，擊落敵機約百八十架。日方未歸還機百五十架，地上及水上之損害輕微。（二）日攻擊機之大半，均爲特別攻擊隊，此外尙有未得確認之戰果。</p>
<p>東京二十三日中央社電日航空部隊十八日以來，對出現於九州南方海面之敵美機動部隊猛加攻擊，至二十一日敵殘存艦艇始以全速力向南方敗退。日空軍攻擎係以航空母檻爲目標，敵艦潰退後，該地戰况已告終了。敵艦逃出日軍之空襲圈，今後或將重整編隊再度蠢動，日方刻在準備中。</p>
<p>某基地二十三日中央社電日軍航空部隊，十八、十九兩日，于海上邀擊來襲日本土之敵機動部隊後，卒使敵受重創潰去，敵人連續來襲之企圖，遂蒙莫大挫折。在敵機實行無差別之槍擊時，洋上之機動部隊，痛遭日機轟炸，日空軍隊員，二十一日于基地特述出擊後之情形如下：十八日零時，逐次由基地出發，于一千米之低空兵力前進，是時敵艦砲火猛烈異常，因而確悉敵之所在地，日軍投下照明彈後，敵艦羣縱列迂型陣之機動部隊，歷歷在目。此時，敵之空母上飛起夜間戰鬥機，日軍之一號、二號雷擊機乃依次俯衝，二號機將魚雷放出後，飛近敵艦上方，確認魚雷已擎中艦首，噴出火焰，艦體傾斜，其次之三號，亦降至百米高度，而擊傷四萬五千噸之戰艦一艘，傍晚續行第二次攻擊時，又擊沉其艦種不詳者一艘。</p>
<h3>衆院預算會席上　日首相表明决意　本土戰塲化有充分準備</h3>
<p>東京二十三日中央社電日一億人民一致期待速取攻勢，二十三日衆院預算總會席上，田伊三次氏曾質詢政府關於此點之決意，當由小磯首相說明，陸海兩相亦作同樣之答覆，緒方情報局總裁，吉田軍需相，亦分別闡明輿論指導，軍需生產等轉取攻勢之方針。茲分別誌其要旨如次：小磯首相稱，近來所謂國人必須有本土戰塲化之覺悟者，乃完成準備以待機滅敵之謂也。因吾人不僅決意不使敵軍輕易登陸，更須有速取攻勢，奪回硫黃島·塞班，甚至加達卡納爾之決意。衫山陸相談，在當前局面下，關於本土戰塲化，業有充分之準備，同時在廣闊之太平洋·拉巴爾·特魯克·菲律賓及其北方諸島嶼，我軍將士仍在繼續英勇之抵抗，此無非因爲防禦敵軍而戰者，小磯首相說明之寓意，即在此處也。米內海相談，今日之情勢，必須採取攻勢，始克打破。</p>
<p>重光外相答覆質問</p>
<p>東京二十三日中央社電二十三日下午，日衆議院預算總會席上，鶴見　輔氏與重光外相關於刻下之外交問題，作如次之質疑問答：</p>
<p>鶴見祐輔氏：克里米亞會談之結果，已暴露敵陣營戰爭理念之破綻，英·美兩國之此種　　，適爲我方外交攻勢之良機，不知外相之意見若何？</p>
<p>重光外相：戰爭之目的，即自身爲戰爭之魂，無魂之戰爭，決無勝利可言。敵竟欲以便宜主義妥協之，因之其戰爭目的已自相矛盾，而我始終一貫高揭正義之大　，邁向完成目的之途。</p>
<p>鶴見氏：在鄧巴頓奧克斯會談時，對戰後處理案，政府曾向內外發表聲明反駁，依予之見，應將之澈底粉碎，未知閣下意見如何？至四月二十五日提出帝閣戰後世界處理案，以駁斥其法也。</p>
<p>重光外相：敵之戰後國際機構案，其要點有三，第一，政治的，經濟的獨佔世界。第二，大國以威力確立獨裁專制。第三，不顾小国及不民族，于民主主义假面具之下，以干涉他國之內政是也。亦即以威力專制橫行世界，而吾方則於開戰伊始之詔勅，以解放民族，安定民生之基礎，幷以互惠平等之精神爲理念。彼等乃係國際的武裝和平，我方乃以國際正義爲基調。彼等於舊金山會議中，以爲已論及次期作戰準備之結果，此際余亦贊成提示戰後世界機構案，然我方之理念，已包括於大東亞五大原則之內矣。</p>
<h3>出席民衆大會　華北代表赴京</h3>
<p>北平二十三日中央社電　出席全國民衆代表大會之華北代表，已由新民會縝密選定爲十五名，於昨日下午搭車首途赴京，由新民會政治局長張子鈞陪同前往。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>慈善機關疏散本身　注意之點</h3>
<p>本市疏散委員會現正積極展開工作，尤以航路陸路交通問題，列爲重點工作，各組專門委員會專責推動。首先實行疏散者決定爲各慈善機關，已由該會執行組會同社會福利局於本月十九日召集各慈善機關代表談話，宣佈疏散辦法要點，並以一個月爲準備期間，一個月後，由該會斟酌日期，在一星期前通知各疏散慈善機關實行疏散。我們曾在本月二十日社評中加以申述，期供各慈善機關作爲準備遷移的參攷。光陰荏苒，一個月的準備時間，極易過去，各慈善機關應各就本身如何實行疏散的種種問題，迅速處理完竣，一旦接到通知，即可從容遷移。茲更就所見，申述如次：</p>
<p>（一）慈善機關首先疏散，已爲當局所完全決定，且已規定爲一個月爲準備期，所以，各慈善機關當局應以全部力量爲準備遷移打算，諸如遷移以後的房產保管等等問題，當局自有安置辦法，不必多所顯慮，因而忽略眼前的準備工作，結果臨事慌亂，友遭不必要的損失。</p>
<p>（二）凡事求人不如求己，在本身能力可及範圍，應盡量利用自力。疏散工作，雖有疏散委員會充分協助，但究屬一般的。因此，在各慈善機關本身，尤應自動的作種種必要準備，勿存依賴心理。</p>
<p>（三）宗敎相同，性質相類的慈善機關，彼此之間，可能合併者，應坦白裔談，先行合併，至少也應合組聯絡機構，相互協力。在此非常時期，非常環境之中，爲謀事業存在，更須放棄平時的各自爲政分歧意見，只須對共同目標有利，雖犧牲小我成見，亦屬應爲之事。</p>
<p>（四）各慈善機關本身經濟狀况，容有不同，應很忠實的作一報告，提供當局，以爲補助的準確參考。凡自問經濟能力足以負起遷移用度及遷移以後維持若干時間者，就可減輕疏散會的負擔，同時，就是減少其他眞正窮苦機關的困難。慈善機關的目的，原是以救人爲唯一信條，彼此同是救人，更不應有小我之見，斤斤於狹義的界限。</p>
<p>（五）遷移時携帶物件，以絕對必要者爲度，愈簡單愈好。因爲目前交通工具之缺乏，乃爲事實上的困離，運輸能力極爲薄弱，疏散委員會雖有專車專船供給，對象也是一般的，笨重物件，必在限制之列。因此，在準備之際，必須顧到，盡量選擇輕簡行李。</p>
<h3>陳行政院長　巡視浙省政情　並主持政治保衛校畢業禮</h3>
<p>杭州二十三日中央社電　陳行政院長兼軍委會委員長，爲巡視浙省政情，於二十一日下午二時由滬抵杭，隨行者有國防會議秘書長丁默邨·政院秘書長周隆庠·軍事最高顧問矢琦中將等，項省長率省府綏署各廳局處長·及文武高級官員·暨省市黨部委員·政冶保衛部萬局長以次各區長·暨盟邦現地官員等，均到站恭迎。陳院長下車，先赴行轅休息，午餐後，即至省黨部省府綏署巡視，在省府聽取省長暨各廳處局長個別報告，對今後工作方針指示甚詳，旋在省府大禮堂向黨政各機關全體工作人員訓話。當晚由項省長在行轅恭宴，二十二日晨十時蒞政治保衛學校主特畢業典禮並訓話，下午在該校大操塲，冒雨檢閱保衛學校學生隊及綏署特務團，復對全體訓話，參加官兵感於委員長精神偉大，益加振勉。檢閱畢，赴西湖四照閣午餐，旋到後演巡視，晚在行轅宴盟邦官員。二十三日晨八時乘專車啓節返京。</p>
<p>首都通訊</p>
<h3>都下風雲</h3>
<p>— 人平</p>
<p>轉險爲夷的米市</p>
<p>一向成爲京市話題的米市，變幻不可捉摸，價格時上時落，貨物忽有忽無，米離撲朔，迴旋不定。自從首都物資評價維紀委員會列米爲八項生活必需品中最重要的一項，嚴厲執行取締囤積以後，米價一度下瀉，後因來源短絀，價格又見波騰。雖然評紀會當局限價每石不得超過兩萬元，終因黑市囂張，無貨應市，形成交易停頓的狀態。</p>
<p>最近當局爲安定民生，於三月九日起，對食米搬運入城，已予開放，將八公斤的限量，擴展到八十公斤，一方面在中華門外，由市府和米統會，會同設立米糧登記管理聯合辦事處，辦理米商或機關團體搬運一石以上食米的登記發證事宜。米市的價格，也由這個辦事處就產地情形，臨時予以處理。從此全市絕跡狀態中的米市，又見復甦，米舖中也都裝滿了米。解禁以後的米價，曾下降至三萬元，但現在已略升。兩月來的米價，可以列表比較如下：</p>
<p>（一）一月廿七日以前，——每石最高價二萬四千元（統制期中）。</p>
<p>（二）一月廿七日至二月十二日止，每石最高價二萬元，最低價一萬七千元（維紀會成立，自由買賣期中）。</p>
<p>（三）二月十三日至二月二十一日，（廢曆春節期米市停頓）。</p>
<p>（四）二月二十二日至三月八日，每石最高價四萬元，最低價二萬六千元（當局公布新限價每石二萬元，黑市逐漸上昇，無貨應市）。</p>
<p>（五）三月九日迄止現在，每石最高價三萬八千元，最低價三萬四千元。</p>
<p>由此可知京市食米價格的變化狀况。現在因當局的亟力疏導米源，同時對於價格，也一反過去的硬性限價制，於是來源頓見踴躍了。</p>
<p>最近關係方面，爲防止商人利用機會，囤積操縱起見，又在三月十八日規定了新的「計口購米」的辦法，規定每戶以原有的購米證戶口人數計算，大口每人每月可購二斗，小口一斗，由出售店加蓋購訖章，這個辦法，如果能够順利推行，那末米價的波浪，也許可以告一段落。</p>
<p>逮捕華鐵不良員工</p>
<p>自從上海北站華鐵黑帽子蔣士彥毆斃女旅客徐佩文案發生以後，不僅滬市各界深爲憤慨，全國人民均極端注意。建設部當局處於主管的地位，已嚴飭該公司將此案處理情形查報，並且要嚴緝該犯歸案法辦，同時經訂定「取締職員不正行爲辦法」十條，切實施行。</p>
<p>同時有個殊堪欣慰的消息：一部份專竊行李車以及浦口下關車站倉庫貨物行李的惡黨，已經在京落綱了。這等橫行不法之徒，已經積案累累，舉不勝舉，　被衆人所詬病。經當局查究以後，知道是一種有組織的竊黨所爲，全部黨羽達三百人之多，大多數是黑帽子和華鐵的火伕苦力，現在先後逮　的，已有數十名，其中主謀犯九名，決依然軍法重處，還有未經捕獲的餘黨，正在嚴密查緝中。</p>
<p>華鐵不良職員的芟除，該是減除民生痛苦的一　重大事件吧。</p>
<p>節約聲中話節電</p>
<p>京市去年因爲煤斤來源缺乏，水電當局公布每晚十時以前，實施分區節電制，至今已有好幾個月了，除軍事機關外，十時以後，也須一律熄燈不准使用，統計每日能使用電燈的時間，至多二三小時而已。</p>
<p>對於普通用戶用電，現在限制頗嚴，商店機關較寬，住戶較緊，住戶最低的限度是每月十三度，如首次超過，處以罰金，第二次就要剪電。此外又規定一戶一燈的原則。以前商店和住戶，曾遭剪綫處分者有數十家之多，現在都注意起來。所以一到晚間，夫子廟的市面成了黑暗世界。</p>
<p>在本年二月中，京市曾有過一次煤慌，全市電流幾乎斷絕，後來經關係當局設法，始能繼續維持。</p>
<p>最近又因煤斤來源缺少，和成本的加巨，水電公司當局已呈准建設部自三月份起每度電費由三十元增至一百十元，計加三倍有餘。</p>
<h3>平市中日協力會　開首次會議</h3>

<p>柏林二十三日中央社電　海通社訊：萊因河套與曼恩資（Mainz）間以及萊瑪根橋頭堡等處，美軍壓力再見增加，然德軍抵抗堅決，敵人推進仍極遲緩。萊因海森及巴拉丁納一帶美軍，繼續從事流動戰，先鋒向東南推動，有抵萊因河岸者。美軍越那希河（Nahe）後，以扇形姿態向曼恩資·　姆斯（Worms）魯維哈芬挺發。美軍沿凱撒勞頓之兩側南進，經德軍抵抗，不使美軍完成對南巴拉丁納之包圍，奧本赫姆小橋頭堡內之德軍，業已退至萊因東岸，來因西岸　根與魯維哈芬間現正激戰未已。萊因河中游萊瑪根橋頭堡，美軍攻勢亦趨緊</p>
<h3>印督華維爾　返國任務</h3>
<p>里斯本二十二日中央社電華維爾就任印督以來，已歷十八閱月，今已在歸國之途。華維爾歸國目的，似爲在歐戰終了後，成爲對日反攻最大基地之印度之軍事政治經濟諸問題，與英政府舉行全面協議，對此作一報告。</p>
<p>瑞典京城二十三日中央社電　海通社訊，邱吉爾昨在下院透露：英國派赴舊金山會議四主要代表如次，外　艾登·副首相阿特里·自治領大臣格蘭朋·駐美大使哈立法克斯。</p>

<h3>最近國際倩勢展望（三）　—松平部長廣播演說詞—</h3>
<p>（七）克里米亞會談之反響</p>
<p>克里米亞會談對於各國究有如何反響？各國僉以爲英美蘇三國過於自作主張，甚至英美國內亦有表示反對者。</p>
<p>最初反對的是特戈爾，他在二月五日廣播時說：「英美蘇未經法國在塲而討論國際問題，其用意何在實令人不解，法國決不受此種協定約束。」羅邱曾擬與特戈爾會見，俾以克里米亞會談之決定事項，用私人黃格通知特戈爾，並慫恿其參加出席舊金山會議，許以列爲主持國之一。但特戈爾拒絕會見，採取强硬態度，表示克里米亞會談與鄧巴頓奧克斯之決定事項不予修正，則堅決不出席舊金山會議，使美國難於應付。於是立即派總統秘書歐萊赴巴黎，求特戈爾諒解，同時美方批評特戈爾態度過於强硬。</p>
<p>其次表示反對的是波蘭亡命政府，於二月十三日發表聲明，以爲英美等乘人不備，隨便又捧起另一個波蘭，使波蘭輪着第五個國家遭到分裂的慘劇，此爲違反大西洋憲章的行動。即美國共黨參議院議員巴頓勃亦批評此項行動之錯誤，渠並聲明如被派爲舊金山會議美國代表，則將堅決辭退</p>
<p>再被批評的是對於德國條件過於苛刻，據羅斯福說明，迫使德國無條件投降，由英美蘇法四國共同在柏林組織管理委員會，加以統治，此外完全破襲納粹黨，改變法律，破壞軍閥主義，破壞軍事設備及軍火生產機構，並用工廠，機械，車輛，工業原料等賠償一切損失，彼等目的企圖使德國一蹶不振。羅斯福三月一日出席上下院聯合會議時，在其演詞中有稱：「吾人並不欲使德國人民受飢餓；「或稱「此目的並非欲毒害德國人民。」但翌日接見新聞記者時，記者等提出質問說，所謂無條件屈服，非使德國奴隸化乎？使羅斯福辯論得汗流　背。</p>
<p>（八）舊金山會議</p>
<p>所謂舊金山會議定四月二十五日在舊金山舉行時，屆時將討論商定和平機構的具體規定，英美蘇法渝及其他被迫對軸心國宣戰的各小國均將參加。當然，開舊金山會議是美國的主張，並且特地選定四月二十五日一天，地點又在太平洋沿岸的舊金山，意見是在對日示威。美國報紙稱，在日蘇中立條約締結四周年的四月二十五日召開會議，實具有深長意義云。重慶大公報在二月十五日社評中，引用美國的論調，推測蘇聯將對日宣戰云</p>
<p>該次會議將審議鄧巴頓奧克斯所決定之國際機構，但前次會議甫經一個月，而各國問已告鬧翻，上面說過法國已堅決表示反對。即如英國國內自由黨下院議員恩比佛利三月七日在倫敦泰晤士報提出反對意見，指出國際機構的投票　不合理，又如大國與小國間發生紀紛時，大國可不受此機構拘束，結果使小國受虧。三月十五日英國勞工黨議員台維斯及自由黨議員哈利斯，亦以此問題質詢邱吉爾，邱吉爾亦無法答辯，僅稱大致不會完全依照理想進行的。</p>
<p>又叙利亞與黎巴嫩是否參加會議，尙未可知。又外約坦因不邀其參加會議而表憤慨。</p>
<p>華盛頓方面在二三天前廣播中曾聲明，該會議並不討論殖民地居民問題，及歐洲各國國境問題。他們的用意，企圖事先使各國緘口，處處爲着本身打算。</p>
<p>（九）結論</p>
<p>在此次大戰中，可以看到的國際現象，完全是各國民各民族所表現出來的民族主義精神。無論在大東亞方面，在歐洲方面，此種民族主義的氣氛，極爲濃厚，猶如第一次歐戰時民族自決主義的抬頭。</p>
<p>世界政治家如洞察此趨向，推行世界政治，則世界人類可以進步發展，否則將造成弱肉强食的世界。羅斯福與邱吉爾果有促使世界進步之能力乎？觀乎目前的做法，他們早已失去此種資格，所以壓倒他們，也就是貢獻於世界的進步。（續完）</p>

<p>市物品配給處發配戶口粉，市民憑四十二號綜合配證領購，近發現偽造配證，現已派員密查究辦。頃據該處稱綜合配給證第四十二號眞證與偽證之區別：（一）綜合配給證第四十二號，係第二排靠右邊之末張，其右邊之黑綫係一直通至上下兩面，並不分開，但偽證之右邊黑綫，係分開不連一起。（二）偽證紙張較薄，且較光滑。（三）所印英文之版模，眞票比較長而狹，偽票爲短而闊，字體較糢糊，希市民特予注意。</p>

<h3>紙號不遵限價　查獲後行賄</h3>
<p>市經濟局爲抑平物價，自經核定主要商品新限價公布施行後，其遵守限價售貨者固屬多數，但陽奉陰違暗中越限出售者，仍復不少，該局爲執行新限價期收宏效計，除會商經濟有關警察當局協助嚴厲執行取締外，並分派大批調查員，分區暗中嚴密調查，其已查獲越價商號均依法懲處。茲悉該局最近派員調查山東路二二六號立新紙號，向吉祥街吉安里七號文源紙號購進白報紙二十五令，每令實售價三萬五千五百元，又售與正興號價爲四萬元，其超越限價甚鉅，不料該文源號主以超越限價事，被當局查獲，恐受當局懲處，當時即以四萬現鈔行賄該調查員，企圖減跡了事，該調查員當將此賄款携帶返局，據實報告，將人款一併轉送市警察局依法懲究。</p>
<h3>愛克斯光綫發明家　倫脫根百歲誕辰　本市學術界定期舉行紀念會</h3>

<h3>War Results of Japanese Air Force Attacks: Ten Enemy Ships Sunk, 180 Enemy Planes Shot Down - Announcement by Japanese General Headquarters</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – Japanese General Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on the 23rd: (1) According to subsequent investigations, the confirmed combined war results of the Japanese air force's attacks on the enemy mobile task force between March 18th and 21st are as follows: Five regular aircraft carriers, one battleship, three cruisers, and one ship of unknown type were sunk; approximately 180 enemy aircraft were shot down. The Japanese side has not recovered 150 aircraft, and damage on the ground and on the water is minor. (2) The majority of the Japanese attack aircraft were part of special attack units. Furthermore, there are unconfirmed war results.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – Since the 18th, the Japanese air force has been fiercely attacking the enemy American mobile task force that appeared in the sea south of Kyushu. By the 21st, the surviving enemy ships began retreating south at full speed. The goal of the Japanese air force attack was aircraft carriers. After the enemy ships retreated, the battle situation in that area has ended. The enemy ships have escaped the Japanese air raid range and may reorganize and act again in the future. The Japanese side is currently preparing.</p>
<p>A Certain Base, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – On the 18th and 19th, the Japanese military air force intercepted the enemy mobile task force attacking the Japanese mainland at sea, ultimately inflicting heavy damage and causing them to retreat. The enemy's attempt to continuously attack suffered a tremendous setback. Regarding the enemy aircraft carrying out indiscriminate machine-gunning, the mobile task force at sea suffered heavy bombing by Japanese aircraft. Japanese air force personnel described the situation after the sortie at the base on the 21st as follows: On the 18th, at midnight, they departed from the base in succession, advancing at a low altitude of 1,000 meters. At that time, the enemy's naval gunfire was extremely intense, confirming the enemy's location. After the Japanese military dropped flares, the enemy fleet's mobile task force in a column formation was clearly visible. At this time, enemy night fighters took off from the aircraft carriers. Japanese Type 1 and Type 2 torpedo bombers dived in succession. After releasing its torpedo, the Type 2 aircraft flew close to the enemy ship and confirmed that the torpedo had hit the bow, causing flames to erupt and the ship to list. The subsequent Type 3 aircraft also descended to an altitude of 100 meters and damaged a 45,000-ton battleship. When continuing the second attack in the evening, another ship of unknown type was sunk.</p>
<h3>At the House of Representatives Budget Committee Session: The Japanese Prime Minister Expresses Resolve - Full Preparation for the Homeland Becoming a Battlefield</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – With the 100 million Japanese people unanimously hoping for a swift offensive, Mr. Taizo Ide questioned the government about its resolve on this point at the House of Representatives Budget Committee session on the 23rd. Prime Minister Koiso explained, and the Army and Navy Ministers also gave similar replies. Mr. Ogata, Director of the Information Bureau, and Mr. Yoshida, Minister of Munitions, also clarified the policies of shifting to an offensive stance in public opinion guidance and munitions production, respectively. A summary of the main points is as follows: Prime Minister Koiso stated that the recent notion that the people must be prepared for the homeland becoming a battlefield means completing preparations to wait for an opportunity to destroy the enemy. Because we are not only determined not to allow the enemy to land easily, but we must also have the determination to quickly take the offensive and recapture Iwo Jima, Saipan, and even Guadalcanal. Army Minister Sugiyama stated that under the current situation, there is full preparation for the homeland becoming a battlefield. At the same time, in the vast Pacific Ocean, Rabaul, Truk, the Philippines, and the islands north of there, our soldiers are still continuing their heroic resistance. This is simply to fight in defense of the enemy forces, and that is the meaning of Prime Minister Koiso's explanation. Navy Minister Yonai stated that in today's situation, an offensive must be taken to break the deadlock.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Responds to Questions</p>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – On the afternoon of the 23rd, at the House of Representatives Budget Committee session, Mr. Yūsuke Tsurumi engaged in the following question-and-answer session with Foreign Minister Shigemitsu regarding current diplomatic issues:</p>
<p>Mr. Yūsuke Tsurumi: The results of the Crimean Conference have exposed the flaws in the enemy camp's war ideology. Such actions by the British and American governments present a good opportunity for our diplomatic offensive. What are the Foreign Minister's thoughts on this?</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Shigemitsu: The purpose of war is the soul of the war itself. A war without a soul cannot be won. The enemy is trying to compromise with expediency, which contradicts their war goals. We consistently uphold justice and move towards completing our goals.</p>
<p>Mr. Tsurumi: During the Dumbarton Oaks Conference, the government issued statements both domestically and internationally refuting the post-war settlement plan. In my opinion, it should be thoroughly crushed. What are your thoughts on this? Will the Imperial government present its post-war world settlement plan on April 25th to refute their plan?</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Shigemitsu: The key points of the enemy's post-war international organization plan are three: First, political and economic monopolization of the world. Second, great powers establishing dictatorial rule through power. Third, disregarding small countries and nationalities, and interfering in the internal affairs of other countries under the guise of democracy. That is, they use power and dictatorship to run rampant in the world. Our side, from the beginning of the war, proclaimed in the Imperial Rescript the liberation of nations and the foundation of stable people's livelihoods, and the spirit of mutual benefit and equality as our ideals. They are pursuing an international armed peace, while we are based on international justice. They believe that the San Francisco Conference will discuss preparations for the next stage of operations. At this time, I also agree to present a post-war world organization plan. However, our ideals are already included in the Five Great Principles of Greater East Asia.</p>
<h3>North China Representatives Go to Beijing to Attend People's Congress</h3>
<p>Beiping, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – The North China representatives attending the National People's Congress have been carefully selected by the New People's Society to consist of fifteen members. They departed by train yesterday afternoon, accompanied by Zhang Zijun, Director of the Political Bureau of the New People's Society.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Evacuation of Charitable Organizations: Points to Note</h3>
<p>The city's evacuation committee is now actively carrying out its work, with particular emphasis on waterway and land transportation issues. Specialized committees have been formed to promote this work. The first to be evacuated have been determined to be charitable organizations. The executive group of the committee, together with the Social Welfare Bureau, convened a meeting with representatives of various charitable organizations on the 19th of this month, announced the main points of the evacuation measures, and designated a one-month preparation period. After one month, the committee will determine a date and notify the charitable organizations to be evacuated one week in advance. We elaborated on this in the editorial on the 20th of this month, hoping to provide charitable organizations with reference for their relocation preparations. Time flies, and the one-month preparation period will pass quickly. Charitable organizations should quickly handle all the various issues related to how to implement the evacuation themselves. Once notified, they can relocate in an orderly manner. We will further elaborate on our observations as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The authorities have fully decided that charitable organizations will be evacuated first, and a one-month preparation period has been stipulated. Therefore, the authorities of each charitable organization should devote all their efforts to preparing for the relocation. Issues such as the preservation of property after relocation will be handled by the authorities, so there is no need to worry too much, which may lead to neglect of the current preparation work, resulting in chaos and unnecessary losses when the time comes.</p>
<p>(2) It is better to rely on oneself than to rely on others. Within the scope of one's own capabilities, one should make full use of one's own resources. Although the evacuation committee will provide full assistance, it is only general. Therefore, each charitable organization should proactively make all necessary preparations and avoid a dependent mentality.</p>
<p>(3) Charitable organizations of similar religions and natures should openly discuss and merge if possible. At the very least, they should jointly establish a liaison organization to cooperate with each other. In this extraordinary period and environment, in order to ensure the survival of the cause, it is even more necessary to abandon the usual separatist opinions and only consider what is beneficial to the common goal. Even if it means sacrificing personal prejudices, it should be done.</p>
<p>(4) The economic conditions of each charitable organization vary. A faithful report should be made to the authorities to provide an accurate reference for subsidies. Those who believe that their economic capacity is sufficient to cover the cost of relocation and maintenance for a certain period of time can reduce the burden on the evacuation committee and, at the same time, reduce the difficulties for other truly poor organizations. The purpose of charitable organizations is to save people as their only creed. Since we are all saving people, there should be no selfish views and adherence to narrow boundaries.</p>
<p>(5) Only absolutely necessary items should be carried during the relocation. The simpler, the better. Because the lack of transportation is a de facto constraint, and transportation capacity is extremely limited. Although the evacuation committee provides special vehicles and ships, it is also general. Bulky items must be restricted. Therefore, one must consider this during preparation and choose lightweight luggage as much as possible.</p>
<h3>Premier Chen Tours Zhejiang Province to Inspect Political Situation and Presides Over Graduation Ceremony of Political Security School</h3>
<p>Hangzhou, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – Premier Chen of the Executive Yuan and Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission arrived in Hangzhou from Shanghai at 2:00 PM on the 21st to inspect the political situation in Zhejiang Province. Accompanying him were Ding Mocun, Secretary-General of the National Defense Conference; Zhou Longxiang, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan; Lieutenant General Yasaki, Senior Military Advisor; and others.

After lunch, he went to the provincial party headquarters and the provincial government pacification headquarters for inspection.

<h3>Trends in the Capital</h3>
<p>– By Ren Ping</p>
<p>The Rice Market Turns Danger into Safety</p>
<p>The rice market, which has always been a topic of discussion in the capital city, is unpredictable, with prices rising and falling from time to time, and goods appearing and disappearing. Since the Capital City Materials Evaluation and Discipline Committee listed rice as the most important of the eight essential commodities and strictly enforced the crackdown on hoarding, the price of rice once fell. Later, due to a shortage of sources, the price rose again. Although the Evaluation and Discipline Committee authorities limited the price to no more than 20,000 yuan per shih (unit of dry measure, about 100 liters), the rampant black market and lack of goods on the market led to a standstill in transactions.</p>
<p>Recently, in order to stabilize people's livelihoods, the authorities opened up the transport of rice into the city, starting on March 9th, expanding the limit of 8 kilograms to 80 kilograms. On the one hand, outside the Zhonghua Gate, the municipal government and the Rice Control Association jointly established a joint office for rice registration and management to handle the registration and certification of rice merchants or organizations transporting more than one shih of rice. The price of rice on the market is also handled temporarily by this office based on the situation in the production areas. Since then, the rice market, which had disappeared in the city, has seen a revival, and the rice shops have been filled with rice again. After the lifting of the ban, the price of rice once fell to 30,000 yuan, but it has now risen slightly. The price of rice in the past two months can be compared as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Before January 27th – the highest price was 24,000 yuan per shih (during the controlled period).</p>
<p>(2) From January 27th to February 12th – the highest price was 20,000 yuan per shih, the lowest price was 17,000 yuan per shih (during the period of the establishment of the Evaluation and Discipline Committee, free trading).</p>
<p>(3) From February 13th to February 21st (the rice market was suspended during the Lunar New Year period).</p>
<p>(4) From February 22nd to March 8th – the highest price was 40,000 yuan per shih, the lowest price was 26,000 yuan per shih (the authorities announced a new price limit of 20,000 yuan per shih, the black market gradually rose, and there were no goods on the market).</p>
<p>(5) From March 9th to the present – the highest price is 38,000 yuan per shih, the lowest price is 34,000 yuan per shih.</p>
<p>From this, we can see the changing situation of rice prices in the capital city. Now, because the authorities are making great efforts to dredge the rice source, and at the same time, they have reversed the past rigid price limit system, the source of supply has suddenly become more active.</p>
<p>Recently, in order to prevent merchants from taking the opportunity to hoard and manipulate prices, the relevant departments have stipulated a new "purchasing rice based on population" method on March 18th, stipulating that each household is calculated based on the number of people in the original rice purchase certificate, with adults being able to purchase two dou (unit of dry measure, about 10 liters) per month and children one dou, and the selling store stamps the purchase certificate. If this method can be successfully implemented, then the waves of rice prices may come to an end.</p>
<p>Arrest of Corrupt Employees of China Railway</p>
<p>Since the case of Jiang Shiyan, a "black hat" (derogatory term for railway staff) of China Railway at Shanghai North Station, beating female passenger Xu Peiwen to death, not only has all sectors of Shanghai been deeply angered, but the people of the whole country have paid close attention. The Ministry of Construction authorities, in their capacity as the competent authority, have strictly ordered the company to investigate and report on the handling of the case, and to strictly arrest the criminal and bring him to justice. At the same time, ten "Measures to Eliminate Improper Conduct of Employees" have been formulated and strictly implemented.</p>
<p>At the same time, there is a particularly gratifying piece of news: a group of villains who specialized in stealing luggage cars and luggage from warehouses at Pukou and Xiaguan stations have been arrested in Beijing. These rampant lawbreakers have accumulated numerous cases, and are widely criticized by the public. After investigation by the authorities, it was learned that it was the work of an organized theft gang, with a total of 300 members, most of whom were "black hats" and railway stokers and laborers. Dozens of them have been arrested, including nine ringleaders, who will be severely punished by military law. The remaining accomplices who have not been captured are being closely investigated.</p>
<p>Eliminating the corrupt officials of China Railway should be a major event in alleviating the suffering of the people.</p>
<p>Talking about Electricity Conservation Amidst Calls for Economy</p>
<p>Last year, due to the lack of coal in Beijing, the water and electricity authorities announced a zoning electricity conservation system before 10:00 PM every night, which has been in place for several months. Except for military institutions, all lights must be turned off after 10:00 PM. Statistics show that the maximum time electricity can be used per day is only two to three hours.</p>
<p>The restrictions on electricity use for ordinary users are now quite strict. Businesses and institutions are treated more leniently, while households are treated more strictly. The minimum limit for households is 13 degrees per month. If this is exceeded for the first time, a fine will be imposed. The second time, the electricity will be cut off. In addition, the principle of one light per household is stipulated. In the past, dozens of stores and households were cut off. Now everyone is paying attention. Therefore, the market in Confucius Temple becomes a dark world at night.</p>
<p>In mid-February of this year, Beijing experienced a coal shortage, and the city's electricity supply was almost cut off. Later, the relevant authorities managed to maintain it.</p>
<p>Recently, due to the shortage of coal and the increase in costs, the water and electricity company authorities have been approved by the Ministry of Construction to increase the electricity fee from 30 yuan to 110 yuan per degree, starting in March, an increase of more than three times.</p>

<h3>Soviet Troops at Mouth of Warta River Break into Stettin Area</h3>

<p>Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – Huitong News Agency reported that US pressure has increased again between the Rhine curve and Mainz, as well as in the Remagen bridgehead. However, German resistance is determined, and the enemy's advance is still very slow. US troops in the Rhine-Hessen and Palatinate areas continue to engage in mobile warfare, with vanguards pushing southeast, some reaching the banks of the Rhine River. After crossing the Nahe River, US troops launched a fan-shaped offensive towards Mainz, Worms, and Ludwigshafen. US troops advanced south on both sides of Kaiserslautern. Through German resistance, they prevented US troops from completing the encirclement of the southern Palatinate. The German troops in the small Oppenheim bridgehead have retreated to the east bank of the Rhine. Heavy fighting is currently underway on the west bank of the Rhine between Bingen and Ludwigshafen. The US offensive at the Remagen bridgehead in the middle reaches of the Rhine River is also intensifying.</p>
<h3>Indian Viceroy Wavell Returns Home on Mission</h3>

Wavell's purpose in returning home seems to be to hold comprehensive consultations with the British government on the military, political, and economic issues of India, which will become the largest base for the counteroffensive against Japan after the end of the European war, and to report on this.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – Huitong News Agency reported that Churchill revealed in the House of Commons yesterday that the four main British representatives sent to the San Francisco Conference are as follows: Foreign Secretary Eden, Deputy Prime Minister Attlee, Dominions Secretary Cranborne, and Ambassador to the United States Halifax.</p>
<h3>Enemy Ship Attacking Andaman Islands Sunk</h3>

At 3:00 PM, they began shelling the island. After the local Japanese army and navy garrison forces returned fire, one enemy ship was sunk. The rest were heavily damaged and fled.

<h3>Recent International Situation Prospects (3) — Minister Matsudaira's Broadcast Speech —</h3>
<p>(7) Reactions to the Crimea Conference</p>
<p>What kind of reactions did the Crimea Conference evoke in various countries? Many countries believed that the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union were acting too independently, and even within the UK and the US, there were expressions of opposition.</p>
<p>The first to object was de Gaulle, who said in a broadcast on February 5th, "It is incomprehensible why the UK, the US, and the Soviet Union are discussing international issues without France's presence. France will not be bound by this agreement."  Roosevelt intended to meet with de Gaulle to inform him of the decisions made at the Crimea Conference using a private messenger, and to encourage him to attend the San Francisco Conference, promising to include France as one of the presiding nations. However, de Gaulle refused to meet, taking a firm stance, stating that unless the decisions made at the Crimea Conference and Dumbarton Oaks were revised, he would firmly refuse to attend the San Francisco Conference, making it difficult for the US to handle.  As a result, the US immediately dispatched Presidential Secretary O’Leary to Paris to seek de Gaulle's understanding. Simultaneously, the US criticized de Gaulle's attitude as being too rigid.</p>
<p>The next to express opposition was the Polish government-in-exile, which issued a statement on February 13th, believing that the UK and US, taking advantage of others' unpreparedness, casually propped up another Poland, causing Poland to suffer the tragedy of being divided for the fifth time. This was an action that violated the Atlantic Charter. Even US Communist Senator Burton Browne criticized the error of this action, and he stated that if he were appointed as a US representative to the San Francisco Conference, he would firmly resign.</p>
<p>Another point of criticism was that the terms for Germany were too harsh. According to Roosevelt's explanation, Germany was forced to surrender unconditionally, and a joint administrative committee of the UK, the US, the Soviet Union, and France would be organized in Berlin to govern it. Furthermore, the Nazi Party would be completely destroyed, laws changed, militarism dismantled, military equipment and munitions production facilities destroyed, and factories, machinery, vehicles, and industrial raw materials would be used to compensate for all losses. Their objective was to render Germany prostrate. Roosevelt said in his speech at the joint session of the two houses of Congress on March 1st, "We do not want to starve the German people," or "This purpose is not to poison the German people." However, when meeting with journalists the next day, the journalists questioned whether unconditional surrender would not enslave Germany, causing Roosevelt to argue until he was drenched in sweat.</p>
<p>(8) San Francisco Conference</p>
<p>The so-called San Francisco Conference is scheduled to be held in San Francisco on April 25th, at which time the specific provisions of the peace organization will be discussed and agreed upon. The UK, the US, the Soviet Union, France, Chongqing, and other smaller countries that have been forced to declare war on the Axis powers will participate. Of course, the San Francisco Conference is the proposal of the United States, and the date of April 25th was specifically chosen, and the location is San Francisco on the Pacific coast, with the intention of demonstrating against Japan. American newspapers claim that holding the conference on April 25th, the fourth anniversary of the signing of the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact, has profound significance. The Chongqing Ta Kung Pao, in its editorial on February 15th, cited the American argument and speculated that the Soviet Union would declare war on Japan.</p>
<p>The conference will review the international organization determined by Dumbarton Oaks, but the countries have already fallen out within a month of the previous conference. As mentioned above, France has firmly expressed its opposition. Similarly, on March 7th, Mr. Emrys-Evans, a Liberal Party Member of Parliament in the UK, raised objections in The Times of London, pointing out that the voting system of the international organization was unreasonable, and that when disputes arose between large and small countries, large countries would not be bound by this organization, resulting in small countries suffering losses. On March 15th, Labour Party MP David Davies and Liberal Party MP Harris also questioned Churchill on this issue, but Churchill was unable to answer, only saying that things would not proceed entirely according to ideals.</p>
<p>It is also unknown whether Syria and Lebanon will participate in the conference.  Furthermore, Transjordan expressed resentment for not being invited to participate in the conference.</p>
<p>Washington had stated in a broadcast two or three days ago that the conference would not discuss the issues of colonial residents or the national borders of European countries. Their intention was to silence the countries in advance, always thinking of their own interests.</p>
<p>(9) Conclusion</p>
<p>In this war, the international phenomenon that can be seen is entirely the nationalistic spirit expressed by various countries and peoples. Whether in the Greater East Asia region or in Europe, this atmosphere of nationalism is extremely strong, like the rise of national self-determination during the First World War.</p>
<p>If world politicians understand this trend and implement world politics, then world humanity can progress and develop; otherwise, it will create a world of the survival of the fittest. Do Roosevelt and Churchill have the ability to promote world progress? Judging from their current practices, they have already lost this qualification, so overwhelming them would contribute to the progress of the world. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Material Distribution Office Investigates - Forged Household Flour Ration Coupons</h3>
<p>The City Material Distribution Office distributes household flour rations, and citizens can purchase them with the No. 42 Comprehensive Ration Coupon. Recently, forged ration coupons have been discovered, and investigators have been dispatched to secretly investigate. According to the office, the differences between the genuine and forged No. 42 Comprehensive Ration Coupons are: (1) The No. 42 Comprehensive Ration Coupon is the last one on the right in the second row, and the black line on its right side goes straight through to the top and bottom without separation, but the black line on the right side of the forged coupon is separated and not connected.

(3) The printed English font is longer and narrower on the genuine coupon, and shorter and wider on the forged coupon, and the font is more blurred. Citizens are urged to pay special attention.</p>
<h3>Fire Department Deputy Director - Investigated for Neglect of Duty</h3>
<p>In order to rectify police discipline, the City Police Department is punishing unscrupulous police officers. Wei Wuzhiqiang, Deputy Director of the Fire Department's Taishan Road Branch, has violated the law and neglected his duty. It has been ordered that he be dismissed from his post for investigation. In addition, the Inspection Department of the bureau is conducting strict supervision and inspection, and police officers who act improperly will be dismissed in accordance with the Provisional Regulations on Special Rewards and Punishments. Those with more serious circumstances, such as extortion or selling positions, will be dismissed and sent to the Third Division for investigation.</p>
<p>Police Department Held Bureau Affairs Meeting Yesterday</p>

<h3>Chemical Industry Factories Urge - Restoration of Power Supply</h3>
<p>According to news from the City Chemical Industry Guild, the industry currently has over one hundred factories. Since last year, they have been unable to operate due to the suspension of power supply, and production has been interrupted. However, the employee costs of each factory are huge, making it difficult to maintain operations, and they are forced to face the risk of dissolution. Recently, Guild Chairman Xie Xiaochu has appealed to relevant authorities to provide relief and restore power as soon as possible to speed up production.</p>
<h3>Paper Shop Disobeys Price Limits - Investigated and Attempts Bribery</h3>
<p>Since the City Economic Bureau approved and announced the new price limits for major commodities to suppress prices, most merchants have complied with the price limits. However, there are still many who secretly sell above the price limits while pretending to comply. In order to effectively enforce the new price limits, the bureau, in consultation with the police authorities related to economic affairs, has dispatched a large number of investigators to secretly investigate by district. Those merchants found to be selling above the price limits are punished according to law. It is reported that the bureau recently dispatched investigators to investigate Lixin Paper Shop at No. 226 Shandong Road, which purchased 25 reams of newsprint from Wenyuan Paper Shop at No. 7 Jianli, Jixiang Street, at an actual price of 35,500 yuan per ream, and sold it to Zhengxing Shop for 40,000 yuan, which greatly exceeded the price limit. Unexpectedly, the owner of Wenyuan Shop was investigated by the authorities for exceeding the price limit and, fearing punishment, immediately bribed the investigator with 40,000 yuan in cash in an attempt to cover up the matter. The investigator immediately brought the bribe back to the bureau, reported the facts truthfully, and transferred the money and the person to the City Police Department for investigation and punishment according to law.</p>

<h3>Obligatory Elementary School Buildings - School Authorities Generously Agreed to Lend</h3>
<p>In order to save out-of-school children and subsidize the lives of unemployed teachers, our organization plans to run obligatory elementary schools, tentatively starting with ten schools. After half a month of active preparation, everything is basically ready. Issues such as borrowing school buildings, selecting teachers, collecting books, raising funds, and setting the curriculum are being carried out separately and must be completed this month. We can now inform all enthusiastic individuals in the community that the selection of teachers has been carried out by interviewing each of the more than 50 registered teachers individually and carefully selecting them based on their knowledge, experience, physical fitness, and spirit of service, and they will be hired today. The number of books collected is also considerable. The school authorities in each district have enthusiastically supported us by happily lending school buildings and are willing to cooperate. This great spirit of empathy and willingness to do what is right is very admirable. The following eight schools have already been decided to be borrowed:</p>
<p>(1) Chengyu Elementary School, No. 56 Dasheng Lane, Xiaodongmen, Nanshi</p>
<p>(2) Shaoxing Shanghai Third Elementary School, No. 324 Jian Road (Carre Road)</p>
<p>(3) Zhengxing Girls' High School, No. 162 Luoyang Road (Seward Road)</p>
<p>(4) Yuguang Elementary School, No. 153 Lane, Jiading Road (Carter Road)</p>
<p>(5) Wenguang Middle and Elementary School, south of Jiangning Road (Gordon Road) and Huaian Road (Mackinnon Road)</p>
<p>(6) Ganggong Middle and Elementary School, north of Changning Road (Brenan Road) No. 22</p>
<p>(7) Hubei Middle and Elementary School, north of North Shanxi Road and Anqing Road (Arnaud Road)</p>
<p>(8) Shugong Elementary School, No. 94 Wuzhou Road</p>
<p>Several other schools have also sent letters agreeing to lend their buildings, and we will send personnel to contact them today to make a decision.</p>
<h3>Impoverished Students Help Impoverished Students, Donating Money and Books</h3>
<p>(1) The entire student body of Zhaoguang Obligatory Elementary School wrote: "Recently, we read in your newspaper about the launch of obligatory elementary schools to rescue out-of-school children, and we were all deeply moved and expressed our sympathy! We are also students of obligatory elementary schools, and before we came to obligatory elementary schools, we also deeply suffered from the painful taste of being out of school, so we feel more sympathy for the general out-of-school children. However, we are all very poor and have difficulty making a living, so we don't have much ability to help. We can only do our best to first put together the snack money we usually save, totaling 12,850 yuan in savings currency, to be used as 'Obligatory School Funds', and old books: Chinese, arithmetic, and general knowledge, totaling 224 copies, to be used as obligatory school textbooks to express our hundreds of passionate hearts, and we will do our best to donate in the future. However, there are many out-of-school children in Shanghai, and a large amount of funding is needed, so we must mobilize the power of the entire society to achieve satisfactory results; therefore, we hope that people from all walks of life who are enthusiastic about education and all students in Shanghai will respond enthusiastically, accumulating small amounts to make a large amount, and gathering together, so that the general out-of-school children who need to be rescued can enjoy the happiness of reading and become useful talents, which is not only the happiness of out-of-school children, but also the happiness of the society and the country!"</p>
<p>(2) Shen Wenying, Chen Meiyu, Zhang Cuizhen, Zhang Juemin, Wang Cuidi, Wang Shaozhi, Zhou Pixian, and Jue Yuanxi, students of the Second Grade B class of the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association First Elementary School, wrote: "Today, when we went to school, we heard Teacher Zhou Wenbo say that your newspaper is launching the 'Obligatory School Funds' campaign to prepare to open obligatory elementary schools, and he said that there are many people out of school now. We were very moved when we heard this. After school in the afternoon, we asked our mothers to save ten days' worth of snack money, totaling 6,000 yuan, to be used as 'Obligatory School Funds'. In the future, we will donate again, and we hope that your newspaper will tell this method to the children of other schools and have them do the same!"</p>
<p>Donating Books in Response to Obligatory Elementary Schools</p>
<p>Li Yanling wrote: "I am sending 119 copies of national elementary school textbooks and 122 copies of high school textbooks to your organization for the needs of your obligatory school. A few volumes are a small expression of my sympathy for helping education." Li's enthusiasm is extremely appreciated. All national elementary school textbooks, Chinese, general knowledge, and arithmetic, whether new or old, are welcome. We respectfully hope that people from all walks of life will donate.</p>
