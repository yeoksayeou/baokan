<h3>冲繩南部島尻地區　展開全面激戰中　日特攻機隊繼續拼撞作戰</h3>
<p>東京二十三日中央社電冲繩日軍據守於東西兩岸之要衝，對企圖突破冲繩本島南部島尻地區地區中央陣地之敵，果敢猛擊，使受甚大損害。二十一日以還，於南部島尻，展開全面之激戰，兩軍戰鬭之焦土，在東海岸地區之新想眞榮平各北方高地及其東南方之磨文仁等一帶，敵爲企圖完全制壓島尻地區之日軍陣地，反續執抝總攻，因而日軍之作戰環境逐加困難，然日軍之士氣，却甚旺盛。</p>
<p>琉球羣島基地二十三日中央社電　日軍航空部隊，二十二日夜旨惡劣天氣，勇敢攻擊冲繩週邊之敵艦船羣，晚十時許，轟沉敵艦種不詳者一艘，此外並有相當之戰果，刻正調査中。又該夜另一機隊曾攻擊冲繩本島之敵飛機塲。</p>
<p>前綫航空基地二十三日中央社電　持滿待機中之日振武特攻隊，爲策應冲繩本島南部地區之日軍陸上部隊，於天氣晴朗之二十一日傍晚及二十二日拂曉，相繼對冲繩本島南方海上敵艦船隊施行拚擡作戰，迄現在止，經判明之戰果，確認掩中敵戰艦二艘，艦種不詳之艦船十四艘</p>
<p>里斯本二十三日中央社電華盛頓來電，冲繩戰綫美合衆社海軍隨軍記者發表，驅逐艦「阿貝爾」號，於冲繩海面哨戒中，五月二日被日特攻機攻擊，使船體炸分兩段而沉沒。攻擊之日特攻機及海軍之戰鬭機，當時由我方艦艇發射散布之高射砲彈幕中通過，矣入「阿貝爾」號之右舷，貫穿艦底機關室，因機關室積戴之炸彈爆炸，於是「阿貝爾」號爆炸起火而沉沒。</p>
<h3>美隨軍記者報告巡艦被擊毀情形</h3>
<p>里斯本二十三日中央社電　據舊金山來電稱，合衆社海軍隨時記者，於去年曾乘美巡洋艦那什維兩號出發非律賓海戰，日前曾報告該艦於明多羅島海面遭日本特攻隊攻擊之情形，此項消息係於去年十二月十三日所記，然因檢閱關係，迄至本月二十日始告解禁，以下責爲該記者之記述：巡洋艦那什維爾號，十二月十三日這日軍特攻機隊攻擊炸毀，該艦於明多羅島海面擔任護航任務，突然日本特攻機由低空直向那什維爾號飛來，衝入艦橋前方，日機未發一彈，亦未投下炸彈，直衝而來，猛然爆炸，黑烟沖天，負傷者痛苦呻吟之聲滿布，船員等急持救火器具，奔向艦橋方面，開始滅火工作，其間艦內各處連續發生誘導爆炸，各船員富時立即將負傷者運往艦內各室，然室內悶熱異常，幾不能呼吸，於甲板上死者幾無暇搶救，當時吾人皆感於艦內所被救護之負傷者，較之甲板上死亡者尤爲不幸</p>
<h3>日下村國務相　西下視察</h3>
<p>東京二十三日中央社電日下村國務相兼情報局總裁爲參拜伊勢神宮，熱田神宮，二十二日午後九時五十五五分由東京站出發西下，視察大阪，神戶，名古屋之戰災地區，出席官民懇談，預定於二十六日返東京。</p>
<h3>蘇建設應長　赴各縣視察</h3>
<p>蘇州二十三日中央社電蘇省建設廳長孫育才，奉任省長之命，特於月來分赴無錫，江陰·武進·松江·金山·淸浦·常熟等縣，視察各公路橋標修建狀况，人民組職設備情形，戰時軍需物資之管理及一般物價問題等要政，幷將繼續出發各縣視察，俾作成具說報告及推一進計劃，以爲省政建設施政之重要參　。</p>
<h3>陳憲兵司令　抵蚌埠視察</h3>
<p>蚌埠二十三日中央社電　中央憲兵司令陳皋氏，爲視察所屬第一團第二中隊駐蚌憲兵服務狀况，於二十日率同隨員等抵蚌。陳氏當即赴該隊視察，對該隊動務狀況及地方軍紀情形，乘詢頗詳，並召集全體憲兵官佐調話語多勗勉。</p>
<h3>檢閱皖淮豫軍隊　陳代主席訓話　（續昨日未完稿）</h3>
<p>現在英·美對戰後歐洲的處置，手段非常酷辣，將來不久必有第三次世界大戰，况且這次英。美蘇的合作不過是一時利害，蘇聯因獲得了軍事勝利，拼命抓住巴爾幹半搗及歐洲大陸各重要點。另一方面，英·美也在那裏培植西歐與法國的勢力，作自己的壁壘，將來總有一天會衝突起來，遲早總有第二次世界的一天。那時，全世界人類將受到更悽慘的刼運，所以我們爲着中國的自由獨立，東亞的解放，我們惟有貫澈參戰初衷，加緊協力，完遂戰爭，爭取勝利，澈底毀滅英·美侵略東亞的野心。</p>
<p>第二，關於反共問題，大家都知這次中。日事變，是受了共黨的挑撥離問而起的，自事變以來，他們却站在旁觀的地位，投機取巧，擴張他們自己的勢力，所以現在共產黨的勢力一天一天的膨脹，人民的痛苦一天一天的加深，我們爲这國家的前途，爲着民族的生存，決不容許共產黨得逞其狡計。共產黨的目的，不外想建立中國蘇維埃政府，把中國做蘇聯的附庸，中華民國是國父所手創的，每一個國民都有愛護中華民國的天職，共產黨要把中華民國斷送，這種企圖是與中華民國的生存根本不能相容的，所以反共政策國府還都當時同是如此，現在更是如此，將來亦是如此。</p>
<p>第三，關於統一問題，大家亦知道一个國家如果不能統一，組織便無法健全，組織不健全，便是政府沒有力量，所以本人一在就任代理主席的時候，便首先揭藥「黨不可分，國必統一」的口號，事變以來，我們內部有不少的畸形現象，無庸諱言，但我們爲了爭取國家獨立自由，爲了對大東亞戰爭盡更大的協力，我們首先從內部的統一做起，更擴而充之，達到全國的統一，有統一才有力量，惟有力量才能擔負更大的任務。皖·淮·豫三省，地處南北要衡，在軍事。政治上，都負有極大的責任，如果地方工作做得好，國家的統「自然可以早日完成，中國統一之後，自必發生更大的力量，當然對於戰爭亦有更大的貢獻。</p>
<p>現在時局日趨緊迫，我們的國策，不但不因時局的推移而有所變更，反而因時局之緊迫，各位的責任更加重大，所望全體單政長官·士兵·民衆精誠團結，向以上三大目標努力連進。</p>
<h3>軍事特別措置法日宣佈全境適用　政會設戰時綱紀肅正部</h3>
<p>東京二十三日中央社電日政府因戰局急速進展，爲傾注國家總力，急速整頓軍事上之必要施設，以期防衛國土於萬一起見，特於第八十六屆議會中，提出軍事特別措置法案，該法於上月五日施行，適用於情勢緊迫之帝國一部領土，茲鑒於本土決戰緊迫之戰局推移，於二十三日由情報局發表稱；本月十九日起，該法已適用於帝國領土全境，茲錄情報局之發表如次：際茲大東亞戰爭，爲整頓築城，設營暨其他軍事上之必要事項，以期防衛國土之萬全計，首先制定軍事特別措置決案，已於五月五日起施行，適用於帝國領土之一部，茲因鑒於戰局之推移，於二月十九日起，改爲適用於施行帝國全部領土。</p>
<p>東京二十三日中央社電大日本政治會，爲順利推展戰時緊急措置法期具體實現信賞必罰制度，與民間戰力增強體制，二十二日之總務會，曾決定於會內置一「戰時綱紀肅正部」（暫稱），部長一席，起用副總裁階級之人物，以期活潑活動，二十六日之總務會，行將決定具體要綱及部長委員等人事。</p>
<h3>凉台閑話</h3>
<p>— 吉田東祐</p>
<p>美軍是否要在中國登陸？</p>
<p>問：　我有很多問題要等你從日木回來後請敎。現在時局業已到了千鈞一髮的最後關頭。我很想知道鹿死誰手的未來歸宿如何？首光我要知道的問題，就是美國究竟是否會在中國登陸？這個問題，特別是一般巾國人迫切所希望知道的。</p>
<p>答：　這個問題，在美（國開始冲繩島作戰前，曾是非常難於解答的一個謎。現在我光說幾句離題稍遠的話，即我在日本時曾聽到：冲繩島開始作戰前，羅斯福曾擬先在中國登陸，但蔣介石不願把中國大陸供日美作翻天覆地的修羅塲，所以要求美國在日木本土登陸。結果，美國考慮到如能佔領冲繩島，則第二步在日本或在中國登陸，都成爲無往不利的絕好跳板，所以便急忙在冲繩島登陸了。這種傳說，眞假雖然不敢斷定，然而我認冲繩島的登陸作戰本身，總可以證明美國不願從馬利亞納經硫黃島，而逕攻日本本土，冒天下之大險心理，也可以證明蔣介石不願讓他國的砲火來轟燒中國的田園情緒。美國旣然在冲繩島站穩了脚步，主力或許仍然北進，直指日本。原因就是假定美國想在中國與重慶並肩作戰，以與日本決一雌雄，則至少需要派來百萬大軍。結果縱能戰勝大陸上的日本軍隊，這也決不能設太平洋上的一塲閙劇，就因此而宣佈閉幕。旣如此，則認爲勿寗移師北上，直指日木，藉以獲取決定性的結果。美國在日本和在中國，如果雙管齊下，同時展開大規模作戰，這是兵力及運輸力都不能允許的取，因此，便想在中國盡量武裝渝軍，使之與日本拼命。這種想法，起碼在下列兩點上是合乎美國人願望的。第，大批美軍如在中國登陸，則很有可能使抗戰區的中國人民，改變一向對美國的友善態度。第二，爲中國而大量流血，從美國人對亞洲人種的觀念上說，這等於天字第一號的大傻瓜。由此可以知道，美國縱令出兵中國·但目的也只是爲了取得供給重慶軍火的交通綫，或是具有其他政治作用的小規模出兵，而決非爲了展開主力戰。</p>
<p>蘇聯是否將參加太平洋戰爭？</p>
<p>問：　你似乎幾時曾說過，美國對日本的戰法，是在戰塲上光造成絕對的優勢，爲達到此目的，美國則迫切地望蘇聯參加大東亞戰爭（參閱拙著貫文本「中國的重新估計」六一面）。如美軍開始在日本本土登陸時，或美軍在大陸戰塲上一帆順風，迫近滿洲國境時，恐怕蘇聯一定會重演一回進駐波瀾的把戲·由西伯利亞出兵吧！</p>
<p>答：我在「國民黨改組與國共合作」一文上曾談到過蘇聯的態度：「爲免得你性急，我把結論先告訴你吧！我認爲史太林在目前的情况上無意參加反日戰爭，同時蘇聯人民也沒有這種意念。蘇聯在今日最所希望者，是休養生息。蘇聯在抗德戰爭上，國力曾受到極大的損失。人民都在憧憬着，歐戰告一段落後，首先要恢復國家的元氣。史太林並無意驅使這批人民再從事戰爭」。後來形勢雖稍有演變，但我認爲這一看法，在原則上一直到今天始終尚未失其正確性。至於其理由，我們再具體地討論一下：</p>
<p>史太林爲德國無條件投降告蘇聯人民書中曾說：「數百年來，斯拉夫民族爲生存和獨立而作的殊死鬭爭，現在業已取得勝利了。現在業已澈底擊斃德國的侵略者與暴徒了」。「歡洲戰爭的時期業已過去了，而和平發展的時代業巳降臨了」。蘇聯人民最初認爲抗德戰爭是保衞祖國的反侵略戰爭，而現在取得勝利後，便認爲數百年來的騙爭目的，業巳完成了。此種民族的情緒，是不可侮的。像俄國這樣國家組織，就是史太林也難於轉移這種民族情緒，而重新動員人民，參加太平洋戰爭，史太林和蘇聯人民，迫切地希望在本國周圍建立起　固的和平狀態，這從叙利亞問題上，對英美法渝發表聲明書中，也可以看出一個明朗的綫索。現在在地中海岸的這樣一個小國裏，又開始燃燒起星里的戰火。這樣微乎其微，小不能再小的戰爭，蘇聯政府尚且大聲疾呼地說是違反克里米亞會議精神，而提議採取緊急措置，恢復和平，由此可知，蘇聯之耍求和平，且具有極大熱忱的。</p>
<p>二，假如參加太平洋戰爭一事，跟斯拉夫民族的生存與獨立息息相關，自然，或許不惜一戰。然而蘇聯對遠東的利害關係，不僅像莫斯科至東京的距離比莫斯科至柏林那樣的疏遠數倍，且目前日本並未威脅到斯拉夫民放的獨立與生存。尤其重要者，乃蘇聯認爲太平洋戰爭是日美爭奪中國市塲的帝國主義戰爭，當然不會插足於自己認爲不恥之地。許多人認爲駐滿的日軍，當戰局緊張而一部他調時，蘇聯或許會要求前此莎俄時代的利權，乘虛而入。此外還要估計到，美國不斷利誘蘇聯參戰的各種陰謀。但今日的蘇聯，與其說是關心一部利權的獲得，莫如說是關心整個世界利權的獲得，所以恐不至爲美國擺佈。</p>
<p>三，蘇聯對太平洋戰爭採取中立的態度本身，卻對歐洲問題上起著無刑的重大作用。例如關於波瀾問題，蒂托政權佔領特里斯特的問題，奧國倫納政權問題等，欲使英美讓步，蘇聯則不決定對日態度，可作討價還價之計，尤為得策</p>
<p>綜觀上述三點，我認爲聯只要現在不受到桃　行動，則不會參加太平洋戰爭的。（未完）</p>

<h3>寄日本思想</h3>
<p>— 莫文</p>
<p>我在櫻花放未放四月離開了東京，而現在已是江南風雨綿綿的時節。旅日數年問，在學問上思想上受過相當的敎益，有過很多機會按觸的日本思想界諸先生，都在我深深的懷念之中，一方面時時刻刻惦記着諸先生在空襲下的安危，一方面更想像着諸光生在時局艱難的今日，努力奮鬭的情形。</p>
<p>回想起來，事變前，室伏高信先生與胡適之先生的論爭是很有名的，現在至今還留下不可磨滅的印象；事變後，室伏先生也曾屢次寫過告中國知識階級書，幷且還有日本很多的思想家也有過不少類似的文字，而主要的都是指出中日合作的必要，或是希望中國人反省。可惜的，我從沒有爲事俗變後日本思想界發表的這類文字所感動過，我想，也許中國的知識階級的一般感想也不過如此而已。</p>
<p>可是，我曾經從少數的思想家中間，得到過深刻的啓示，那也是不可諱言的事實，也許在發表的文字中德不免有虛飾的成分，沒有個人的談話比較眞率，也許因爲言的趨向，必須加强優越的論調，沒有眞正憂時憂國時，熱誠能够充分的表露。然而因此事變之後，中日間的思想界中仍舊留着不可掩飾的鴻溝，眞是萬分遺憾的事。</p>
<p>而時至今日，已到了不能不互相推心置腹，共謀解決這空前危局的時機，現在大家爲什廢要有虛飾的成分呢？爲什麼要故意裝起優越的論調呢？日本思想界的先生們·友人們，現在已不是以文字求反響，以敎訓得反省的時候·確實到了以正實語正實·以誠意博誠意的時候了。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>上一月，上海各報迎載過中山優氏的隨想錄。當然這不是紙面的浪費，有很多中國的讃者曾經仔細味讀過的，然而這篇文章的反響如何呢？從表面上看，恐怕未能如中山氏所期待的那樣熱烈吧。可是，我相信在凝者的心底的確有着不發表的反響的，不論這反響中，有反感，或是共鳴，總之還可以承認中山氏自身是有正實與誠意的。</p>
<p>然而中山氏的立塲除了個人之外，還有有公務在身，所以就是有充分的正實與誠意，還不能不受種種拘束。然而一般立塲比中山氏更自由的日木思想界中的人物，爲什麽在緊迫如今日的情勢下，對於中日問題反默默無聞了呢？</p>
<p>幾年前，東亞協同體，綜合體的理論，囂然塵上，中國的雜誌報章上也紛紛謂　，可是現在電像過了一個時代，除了戰局的推論而外，沒有理論的建設了。一時在日本目爲協同體論者的加田哲二博士據說最近來過上海，除了論目前的經濟問題，或是寫「近代日本的性格」而外，也不發表其他什麽構想雄大的文字。由此又可以知道日本思想與中人已經不是專說自己要說的話，正在靜觀中日的現狀，正在逐漸轉變，在今日的沈默中，可以看出正預備說正實與誠實的話。我希望這猜測是不錯的，希望日本思想能由沈默的反省而趕快發表正實與誠意的意見。</p>
<p>還有近年以長篇大論活躍於上海輿論界的吉山東佑氏舉說又從日本回到上海。在上海物價高漲，形式複雜的今日，當然吉田氏自有不得不發的言論，而且吉田氏這次體驗了戰時祖國是生活，再回到上海來，其感覺當然更起深刻，希望吉田氏能以他的特有的世界觀，再代表日本的思想界在中國一露頭角。</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>現在正是梅雨時節，日本的思想界或許也都在鬰積之中醞釀着。我希望負着「知幾其神」的日本思想界能够勇敢的負起責任來，消除過去虛飾的成分，優越的論調，以正實與誠意，與中國讀者相見。</p>
<p>我深深的懷念着的日本思想界諸先生，假如能在時局緊迫的今日，寫出字字正實，語語至截的文字，一走能夠爲中日的前途打開新的途徑。</p>
<p>記得岡倉大心在日俄戰爭正　的時候，寫下了「日本的覺醒」。日本現在也應該有天心那樣有氣魄有職見的思想家出現，一方面對於「日本的覺醒」補寫天心未見的現階段，一方面實現天心「東方之理想」的首句」亞細亞者一也」的名訓。</p>

<h3>島田班長揭露　敵美對渝陰謀　竭力擴展勢力圈</h3>
<p>上海日本陸軍部報道班長島田大佐，於昨午在報道常會席上，對美駐渝外交軍事代表所發表之聯合聲明，特發表談話如次：</p>
<p>聯合聲明欲蓋彌彰</p>
<p>據渝方中央社六月二十日電稱：美駐渝大使哈萊與駐渝之美軍總司令韋特曼所發表之聯合聲明，其內容稱：外傳吾人間及所屬部下，甚至公私方面意見紛歧之說，純屬子虛，即使吾人相互問遇有意見時，當必能圓滿解決。在中國之美國外交人員及軍事代表，目前一致協力，努力工作，今後亦始終不懈云云。査此項聯合聲明之突然公開發表，其中情形，姑不予完全判斷，惟因該事而採取聯合聲明之步驟，據其聲明內容所表明者，可謂不但對兩人間之不治，以及部下或公私雙方意見紛歧之　言，加以強烈之否認·更可窺見此項問題，並非如此簡單。查自史蒂成爾調任時起，駐渝之美外交軍事雙方間，已不能完全一致，極爲明瞭。其時史迪威爾曾向渝提出強硬要求，而遭遇渝方及美駐渝外交機關竭力反對，嗣後韋特曼之調任，似乎空氣稍告緩和，其實至今猶未完全解決。</p>
<p>美軍觀戰在渝勢力</p>
<p>當史蒂威爾在任時，美在渝方竭力擴展其勢力圈，在軍事或經濟上，任何人不能不語承認。例如：　駐渝美軍屢爲渝方所憎惡，且在戰區之渝軍，對美國士兵之驕傲成性，及舒適之生活，迭表不滿。紐約泰晤士報駐渝特派員，亦曾明切闡述。但當韋特曼蒞任後，竟不顧各方之指癡，復與五月中旬，將在北緬之美國兩師團移至芷江，而美國陸軍部隊赴渝，則以此爲始。當初美軍至渝，自以為優異之白色人種，驕傲更甚，其時並有精銳軍向其他方面移動，同時爲防範南方，竟向蔣介石提出封鎖共軍六萬人之要求，蔣竟予允許，致在此數月內，造成渝方政治上最大之問題。自美第十軍至渝後，在用兵方面，韋特曼對渝方之直接交涉，當更倔強·過去渝方對史蒂維爾已予以嚴格之批評，詎料繼任之韋特曼，由於日期漸入，竟似逐步重陷史蒂威爾之復徹，可見美國對渝用心之一般。據二十日路透社電，韋特曼決定在中國戰域，設立美國戰術司令部，此足證明美國侵略之證據，他如關於貸渝軍火問題，當與渝方能使用時，韋特曼即有發言之權，而最近延安對渝政權租偕軍火之批評，頗表不滿，而駐渝之美外交機關，則向渝政權聯絡暫予容忍。</p>
<p>敵美陰謀頗爲明顯</p>
<p>根據駐渝美軍協助渝軍重編計劃協定，以強化渝軍，其指揮官爲何應欽，而美方則又委麥克洛伐襄助何氏，惟據紐約報載，史蒂威爾爲防範雲南高原，反對調遣在緬之美國化妝備渝軍，且對內戰至使用問題，亦有所發表。面在哈萊方面，又不得不代渝政權出而灝庭。總之，此項自聯合聲明，美表面上爲協助渝方，惟其視中國爲美國殖民地之陰謀，爲頗顯明，故渝政權有所主張時，決難取得美國之同意。</p>

<h3>銀錢業會議決定　停用發款單　通告各行莊七月三日起實行</h3>
<p>本市銀錢兩業前以現鈔缺乏，曾由各會員行莊分向銀聯錢庫領用撥款單，以資調劑，但多流通於市面，互相授受，迎遲不爲付款之提示·其數額繁鉅。各行莊發之撥款單殊欠　愼，以致市上僞造撥款單　見不鮮，市僧復乘機貼現牟利，賓非所宜。為强固金融共策安全起見，爰於本月二十日召開銀錢業聯席會議，共同決定於七月三日起各業往來戶停止使用撥款單。同時對於今後各行莊至榮務上現鈔需要數額煩多討論，後經該兩公會分別石　理監事會議，　討停止使用墢款單之各項實施細則問題，亦經分別決走，並已由銀　錢庫擬定各同業往來戶停止使用撥款單辦法六項，正式通告各會員行莊，遵照辦理。且銀錢業此種措施，對於各同業往來客戶利害關係至大，亦擬於最近通告各客戶週知，以利業務。</p>

<h3>印花稅局　禁漏貼印花</h3>
<p>江蘇印花菸酒稅局，以市各商號對於日常門市交易不開發還，漏貼印花，甚或開發票而不貼印花，相習成風，比比皆是。前曾一再勸告商民務須遵章實貼印花，不得玩忽，以重國稅而免處罰。惟自本年四月十五日，本市市政府財政局，規定塡用特稅發票以後，各商號每多曲解。以爲塡給顧客特稅發票，可以不貼印花。更有塡用注財政局蓋印之自製雙聯單發票，旣不交給顧客，亦不實貼印花，以爲備作查對特稅之用。種種取巧漏稅，不一而足，殊屬非是，自應亟予糾正，爰特再警告各商號，無論塡用財政局規定之特稅發票，或目製之門售雙聯單發票，均須遵單實貼印花，絕對不得遺漏，如再故違，或故意不開發票，一經査獲，定予移送法院，按照最近國防會議通過之漏稅罰則，科以五百倍之嚴重罰鍰。</p>

<h3>新聞協會昨舉行　時事講演會　松本大尉等出席演講</h3>
<p>中國新聞協會上海區分會，於昨（二十三）日下午五時假華懋飯店舉行時事講演會，敦請盟邦艦隊報道部松本大尉及秋　，宇崎兩囑託　　。松本大尉及秋田宇崎兩囑，準特蒞臨，由區分會理事長陳彬龢，理事兼總幹事陳日平等招待，業到文化敎育界來賓等五百餘人。</p>
<p>主席致詞</p>
<p>首由主席陳日平氏致開會詞：略謂「目前戰局日趨緊迫，尤以冲繩島東方海面之戰爲烈。敵美進犯冲繩，作戰八十餘日，日軍英勇迎擊，使敵美蒙受重大損害。美第十軍司令巴克納及參加冲繩作戰之第九十六師團代理師團長伊士萊等重要長官之陣亡，即可見當時製方攻防戰鬭之激烈。但吾人過去對此但情况僅自報端見之而己，爲使各位詳細明瞭及認識時局起見，特請盟邦報道關係者松本大尉及秋山。宇崎　囑　　　。」</p>
<p>演講情形</p>
<p>出宇崎秋出二氏，就　沖繩戰後趨勢，　大陸作戰之可能性，作　明講演，幷估計敵美在歐軍力移亞之時間，指出其企圖利用中國人力資源對日作戰之詭　。後者並闡述美援渝軍火運輸困難重重，且物址殊　，對敵美大陸作戰企圖，根據其兵力推測　屬當然，但應注意其背後之險謀，而嚴加防範。末請松本大尉演講，題爲「東亞命運和靑年使命」，詞畢，即放映音樂巨片，歷三小時始行散會</p>
<p>松本大尉演詞</p>
<p>應於太平洋戰局之過去及將來之演變，已由秋山宇崎二位闡明，毋庸　言。　就東亞前途與靑年使命，一加檢討。本來亞細亞民族是農村的共同體的社會，隨着大自然而生　。自歐美文化輸人後，才變成英美式的近代生活。當然所謂歐美文化，在販　之餘，尚有很多使東洋文化發展之處，但中日兩國接受歐美文化之方法與途徑不得當，致誤入「在英美文化下討生活」之歧途。</p>
<p>英美勢力促成鬬爭</p>
<p>日木昭和十二年，中日事變之所以發生，推其原因，即由中日兩國不同之英美勢力的鬭爭所造成。中日事變旣經發生，爲解決起見，吾人亟應將遺留於兩國之英美殘餘勢力，根太剷除。於是日本即於此　題之下推移事變，所以發動大東亞戰爭，這也是厯史上必然的現象。日本與英美作戰，最重要目的厥爲擊滅英美及解決中日間題，消滅在日本之英美勢力。但在前期大東亞戰爭中，日軍在太平洋作戰上獲得相當勝利後，國內即因此忘却了「解決中日問題，消滅國內英美勢力」之重要課題。如此，日本對時局之演進，以至於昭和十七廿敵美反攻開始以　於目前的情形。</p>
<p>此地步，日本國民及指導者始重復顧及對中日問題之硏究解決及調整國內情形之必要，而開始努力。語曰：「憂勞可以興國」，日本即如是。</p>
<p>同時，吾人再觀中國，有國民政府及重慶延安兩政權，成鼎立之勢，現在日本正鄭重觀察，設法尋求解決及調整種種問題之適當途徑。吾人本眞誠反省態度，往現代新路綫前進，對中國之努力奮鬭，抱有極大的期待。吾人在此轉換時期，應回想孫文先生之大亞洲主義，勿以區區戰局而錯亂目光，應具實地為將來應循之途徑努力。</p>
<p>中日青年共同努力</p>
<p>將來真正擔負領導大東亞之責任者，爲中國民族大和民族。十七世紀以來，爲支酊世界文化，發生二次大戰，現在正瀕於破壞的時期。德國司蒂鮑拉博士曾說過：「歐洲文化已漸趨沒落，而新的文化將自太平洋上昇起，使整個亞洲有黎明的光輝的是中國與日本，其原動力則爲中日兩國的靑年，具有優秀思想的靑年。」日本有一句話說：「青年學生應好好用功，好好遊玩。」但此外，對中國的現狀及將來，要又抱負，俾今後成為復興東亞建設東亞之共同體。以上吾人認為是中日兩國共同努力的課題。</p>

<h3>私校敎職員工渴望特配米</h3>
<p>敎職員生活的淸苦，是人盡皆知的事實，因此，頗得社會人士的同情，更獲得當局的體面，給予公務員同樣的待遇，享受重點配給，地域私校員工每月可得特配米三斗。</p>
<p>但是，事實上按月三斗，却尚未有過；况且自五月中旬，補發三月份上半月第十三期一斗五升以來，轉瞬一月有餘，尚無續發消息。</p>
<p>際此百物瘋狂飛漲之時，敎職員工一學期的薪給，僅足　米一斗，－或者尚不及一斗－若無特配米之享受，生活將如何維持？</p>
<p>警務員及市校員工，六月份俸米已蒙發給，何以私校員工，三月份下期猶無配給消息，以致一般員工，頗受生活威脅！</p>
<p>目前各校已聞始終了考試，　職員工作比較忙碌，渴望當局俯念生活淸苦，將私校敎職員工的特配米，提前發給，並期望補足四五六月份，以安定一萬餘人的生活，勿使彼等在此學期結束期間，爲愛慮生活而疏怠職務，實是無上的企盼（金　）</p>

<h3>Fierce Fighting Unfolds in the Shimajiri District of Southern Okinawa; Japanese Special Attack Units Continue Kamikaze Tactics</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Japanese forces in Okinawa, holding strategic points on both the east and west coasts, are fiercely striking at the enemy attempting to break through the central position of the Shimajiri district in southern Okinawa Island, inflicting significant damage. Since the 21st, a full-scale battle has unfolded in Shimajiri, with the scorched earth of the two armies fighting around the northern highlands of Shinzae-Haruhira and their southeast, including Mabuni in the eastern coastal area. The enemy continues to launch a general offensive in an attempt to completely suppress the Japanese positions in the Shimajiri district, making the operational environment increasingly difficult for the Japanese forces. However, the morale of the Japanese troops remains very high.</p>
<p>Ryukyu Islands Base, 23rd (Central News Agency) - On the night of the 22nd, despite the adverse weather, Japanese air units bravely attacked enemy ships around Okinawa. Around 10 PM, they sank an enemy ship of unknown type and achieved considerable other results, which are currently under investigation. That same night, another unit attacked enemy airfields on Okinawa Island.</p>
<p>Forward Air Base, 23rd (Central News Agency) - The waiting Japanese "Shinbu" Special Attack Unit, to support the Japanese ground forces in the southern Okinawa Island area, carried out kamikaze attacks on enemy fleets south of Okinawa Island at dusk on the 21st and dawn on the 22nd, when the weather was clear. As of now, confirmed results include the confirmed sinking of two enemy battleships and fourteen ships of unknown types.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency) - A Washington dispatch reports that a U.S. Associated Press naval correspondent on the Okinawa front reported that the destroyer USS "Abel," while on patrol in Okinawan waters, was attacked by a Japanese kamikaze plane on May 2nd, causing the ship to break into two sections and sink. On the day of the attack, the kamikaze plane and naval fighter aircraft passed through the barrage of anti-aircraft shells fired by our ships at the time and crashed into the starboard side of the "Abel," penetrating the bottom of the engine room. The bombs loaded in the engine room exploded, causing the "Abel" to explode, catch fire, and sink.</p>
<h3>U.S. War Correspondent Reports Cruiser Destroyed</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from San Francisco, a U.S. Associated Press naval correspondent, who had sailed on the U.S. cruiser USS "Nashville" during the Philippine Sea battle last year, recently reported on the ship being attacked by a Japanese special attack unit off Mindoro Island. This news was recorded on December 13th last year, but due to censorship, it was only released on the 20th of this month. The following is the correspondent's account: The cruiser USS "Nashville" was destroyed by a Japanese special attack unit on December 13th. The ship was escorting off Mindoro Island when suddenly a Japanese kamikaze plane flew directly at the "Nashville" from low altitude, crashing into the front of the bridge. The Japanese plane did not fire a single shot or drop any bombs, it crashed directly and exploded violently, black smoke filled the sky, and the groans of the wounded spread everywhere. Crew members rushed to the bridge with firefighting equipment and began firefighting operations. During this time, successive induced explosions occurred throughout the ship. Crew members immediately transported the wounded to the interior of the ship, but the rooms were extremely hot and almost unbreathable. There was little time to rescue those who died on the deck. At the time, we all felt that the wounded being rescued inside the ship were even more unfortunate than those who died on the deck.</p>

<h3>Reviewing the Anhui, Huai, and Henan Troops; Chairman Chen's Address (Continued from yesterday's unfinished draft)</h3>
<p>Currently, the methods of England and America in dealing with post-war Europe are extremely harsh. A third world war is inevitable in the near future. Moreover, the cooperation between England, America, and the Soviet Union is only a matter of temporary interests. The Soviet Union, having gained military victory, is desperately seizing the Balkan Peninsula and various important points on the European continent. On the other hand, England and America are also cultivating the forces of Western Europe and France there as their own bulwark. Sooner or later, there will be conflict. Sooner or later, there will be a second world war. At that time, all of humanity will suffer even more tragic misfortunes. Therefore, for the sake of China's freedom and independence, and for the liberation of East Asia, we have only to carry through our original intention of participating in the war, strengthen our cooperation, complete the war, strive for victory, and thoroughly destroy the ambitions of England and America to invade East Asia.</p>
<p>Secondly, regarding the anti-communism issue, everyone knows that this Sino-Japanese Incident was caused by the instigation and alienation of the Communist Party. Since the incident, they have stood by as observers, taking advantage of opportunities to expand their own power. Therefore, the power of the Communist Party is expanding day by day, and the suffering of the people is deepening day by day. For the sake of the future of this country and for the survival of the nation, we will never allow the Communist Party to succeed in its cunning plans. The goal of the Communist Party is nothing more than to establish a Chinese Soviet government and make China a vassal of the Soviet Union. The Republic of China was founded by the Father of the Nation, and every citizen has the natural duty to protect the Republic of China. The Communist Party wants to sacrifice the Republic of China. This attempt is fundamentally incompatible with the survival of the Republic of China. Therefore, the anti-communist policy of the National Government was the same when the capital was restored, it is the same now, and it will be the same in the future.</p>
<p>Thirdly, regarding the unification issue, everyone also knows that if a country cannot be unified, its organization cannot be sound. If the organization is not sound, then the government has no power. Therefore, when I first assumed the post of Acting Chairman, I first raised the slogan "The Party must not be divided, the country must be unified." Since the incident, there have been many abnormal phenomena within us, which is undeniable, but in order to strive for national independence and freedom, and in order to contribute more to the Greater East Asia War, we must first start with internal unification, and then expand it to achieve national unification. Only with unification can there be strength, and only with strength can we undertake greater tasks. Anhui, Huai, and Henan provinces are located in a strategic position in the north and south, and bear great responsibility in military and political affairs. If local work is done well, national unification can naturally be completed sooner. After China is unified, it will naturally generate greater strength and, of course, make a greater contribution to the war.</p>
<p>Now the situation is becoming increasingly urgent. Our national policy will not only not change due to the passage of time, but because of the urgency of the situation, your responsibilities are even greater. It is hoped that all administrative officials, soldiers, and civilians will unite sincerely and work hard towards the above three major goals.</p>
<h3>Military Special Measures Law Announced, Applicable Throughout Japan; Political Association Establishes Wartime Discipline Rectification Department</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Due to the rapid progress of the war situation, in order to concentrate the total strength of the nation, rapidly rectify the necessary military facilities, and prepare for the defense of the country in case of emergency, the Japanese government submitted a Military Special Measures Bill to the 86th Diet. The law, which came into effect on May 5th, applies to parts of the Empire where the situation is urgent. In view of the imminent mainland decisive battle, the Information Bureau announced on the 23rd that: from the 19th of this month, the law has been applied to the entire territory of the Empire. The Information Bureau's announcement is recorded as follows: In light of the Greater East Asia War, in order to rectify the construction of fortresses, camps, and other necessary military matters, and to ensure the complete defense of the country, the Military Special Measures Resolution was first formulated and implemented from May 5th, applying to a part of the territory of the Empire. In view of the development of the war situation, from February 19th, it has been changed to apply to the entire territory of the Empire.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) - In order to smoothly promote the wartime emergency measures law and concretely realize the system of rewards and punishments and enhance the civilian wartime strength system, the Greater Japan Political Association decided at its General Affairs Committee on the 22nd to establish a "Wartime Discipline Rectification Department" (tentative name) within the association. The position of department head will be filled by a figure of the Vice President class in order to activate activities. The specific guidelines and personnel for the department head and committee members will be decided at the General Affairs Committee on the 26th.</p>
<h3>Casual Chat from the Veranda</h3>
<p>— Yoshida Toyu</p>
<p>Will the American Military Land in China?</p>
<p>Question: I have many questions to ask you when you return from Japan. The current situation has reached a critical juncture. I would like to know what the future holds and who will emerge victorious. The first question I want to know is whether the United States will eventually land in China? This question, in particular, is what the general Chinese people urgently want to know.</p>
<p>Answer: This question was very difficult to answer before the United States began its Okinawa operation. Now, let me say a few words that are slightly off-topic: When I was in Japan, I heard that before the Okinawa operation began, Roosevelt had planned to land in China first, but Chiang Kai-shek was unwilling to let the Chinese mainland become a chaotic battlefield for the life-or-death struggle between Japan and the United States, so he requested that the United States land on the Japanese mainland. As a result, the United States considered that if it could occupy Okinawa, the second step of landing in Japan or China would become an excellent springboard for invincibility, so it hurriedly landed on Okinawa. Although I dare not say whether this rumor is true or false, I believe that the Okinawa landing operation itself can prove that the United States is unwilling to attack the Japanese mainland directly from the Mariana Islands via Iwo Jima, risking the world's great danger, and can also prove Chiang Kai-shek's unwillingness to let foreign fire burn down China's fields and gardens. Now that the United States has gained a firm foothold in Okinawa, its main force may still advance north, directly targeting Japan. The reason is that if the United States wants to fight alongside Chongqing in China and compete with Japan for victory, it will need to send at least a million troops. Even if it can defeat the Japanese army on the mainland, it will certainly not be able to declare the end of a drama on the Pacific Ocean because of this. Given this, it is believed that it is better to move the troops north and directly target Japan in order to obtain decisive results. If the United States were to launch large-scale operations in both Japan and China at the same time, this is not an option that its military strength and transportation capacity would allow. Therefore, it wants to arm the Chongqing army as much as possible and make it fight desperately with Japan. This idea, at least, meets the wishes of the Americans in the following two points. First, if a large number of American troops land in China, it is very likely that the Chinese people in the anti-Japanese war zones will change their friendly attitude towards the United States. Second, shedding a lot of blood for China is, in the eyes of Americans, a complete foolishness in their view of the Asian race. From this, it can be seen that even if the United States sends troops to China, its purpose is only to obtain a transportation line to supply Chongqing with military supplies or to have other political effects from a small-scale troop deployment, and not to launch a main battle.</p>
<p>Will the Soviet Union Participate in the Pacific War?</p>
<p>Question: You seem to have said before that the United States' strategy for fighting Japan is to create an absolute advantage on the battlefield. To achieve this goal, the United States urgently hopes that the Soviet Union will participate in the Greater East Asia War (see my book "Reassessment of China," page 61). If the U.S. military begins to land on the Japanese mainland, or if the U.S. military is sailing smoothly on the mainland battlefield and approaching the border of Manchuria, I am afraid that the Soviet Union will replay a scene of entering Poland and send troops from Siberia!</p>
<p>Answer: I have talked about the Soviet Union's attitude in an article on "The Reorganization of the Kuomintang and the Cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party": "To avoid your impatience, let me tell you the conclusion first! I believe that Stalin has no intention of participating in the anti-Japanese war in the current situation, and the Soviet people do not have this intention either. What the Soviet Union hopes for most today is to recuperate. The Soviet Union suffered great losses to its national power in the war against Germany. The people are all looking forward to restoring the country's vitality after the end of the European war. Stalin has no intention of driving these people to engage in war again." Although the situation has changed slightly later, I believe that this view has remained essentially correct until today. As for the reasons, let's discuss them in more detail:</p>
<p>Stalin said in his letter to the Soviet people on Germany's unconditional surrender: "For hundreds of years, the Slavic people's desperate struggle for survival and independence has now been victorious. The German invaders and thugs have now been completely defeated." "The era of the war in Europe has passed, and the era of peaceful development has arrived." The Soviet people initially believed that the war against Germany was a war of defense against aggression to protect their homeland, and now that they have achieved victory, they believe that the purpose of the centuries-old struggle has been accomplished. This national sentiment cannot be insulted. In a country like Russia, even Stalin can hardly shift this national sentiment and remobilize the people to participate in the Pacific War. Stalin and the Soviet people eagerly hope to establish a solid state of peace around their country. This can also be seen from the statement issued to Britain, America, France, and Chongqing on the Syrian issue, which provides a clear clue. Now, in such a small country on the Mediterranean coast, the flames of war are beginning to burn again. The Soviet government is vociferously calling this insignificant war a violation of the spirit of the Crimean Conference and proposing that urgent measures be taken to restore peace. From this, it can be seen that the Soviet Union's desire for peace is extremely fervent.</p>
<p>Second, if participating in the Pacific War is closely related to the survival and independence of the Slavic people, they would naturally be willing to fight at all costs. However, the Soviet Union's interests in the Far East are not only several times more distant than the distance from Moscow to Berlin to Tokyo, but also Japan is not currently threatening the independence and survival of the Slavic people. What is particularly important is that the Soviet Union believes that the Pacific War is an imperialist war between Japan and the United States to seize the Chinese market, and of course it will not set foot in a place it deems shameful. Many people believe that when the Japanese army stationed in Manchuria is partly transferred due to the tense situation, the Soviet Union may demand the rights and interests of the former Tsarist Russia and take advantage of the situation. In addition, we must also consider the various conspiracies of the United States to constantly entice the Soviet Union to participate in the war. However, the Soviet Union today is less concerned with obtaining a part of the rights and interests than with obtaining the rights and interests of the entire world, so it is unlikely to be manipulated by the United States.</p>
<p>Third, the Soviet Union's neutral attitude towards the Pacific War itself plays an incalculably important role in European issues. For example, on the Polish issue, the Tito regime's occupation of Trieste, the Austrian Renner regime issue, etc., in order to make Britain and the United States concede, the Soviet Union can use its undecided attitude towards Japan as a bargaining chip, which is particularly effective.</p>
<p>In summary of the above three points, I believe that the Soviet Union will not participate in the Pacific War as long as it is not subjected to any act of provocation. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Weekly Commentary</p>
<h3>To the Japanese Thought</h3>
<p>— Mo Wen</p>
<p>I left Tokyo in April, when the cherry blossoms were just beginning to bloom, and now it is the season of continuous rain in Jiangnan. During my years in Japan, I received considerable education in scholarship and thought, and I deeply miss all the professors in the Japanese intellectual circle with whom I had many opportunities to contact. On the one hand, I am constantly worried about the safety of the professors under the air raids, and on the other hand, I imagine the situation of the professors striving hard in today's difficult situation.</p>
<p>Looking back, the debate between Mr. Murofushi Takanobu and Mr. Hu Shih before the Incident was very famous, and it still leaves an indelible impression today. After the Incident, Mr. Murofushi also repeatedly wrote letters to the Chinese intellectual class, and many Japanese thinkers also had many similar writings, the main point of which was to point out the necessity of Sino-Japanese cooperation or to hope that the Chinese people would reflect. Unfortunately, I have never been moved by this kind of writing published by the Japanese intellectual circle after the Incident. I think, perhaps the general feeling of the Chinese intellectual class is just like this.</p>
<p>However, I have received profound enlightenment from a few thinkers, which is also an undeniable fact. Perhaps the published writings inevitably have elements of embellishment, and personal conversations are more sincere. Perhaps because of the trend of speech, it is necessary to strengthen the superior tone, and without true concern for the country and the people, the enthusiasm cannot be fully expressed. However, because of this incident, there is still an undeniable gap left in the intellectual circles between China and Japan, which is a great pity.</p>
<p>Today, the time has come when we must sincerely confide in each other and jointly seek to resolve this unprecedented crisis. Why should we have elements of embellishment now? Why should we deliberately put on a superior tone? Japanese intellectuals and friends, now is not the time to seek response with words or to gain reflection with teachings. It is indeed time to speak truthfully and honestly, and to seek sincerity with sincerity.</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>Last month, the Shanghai newspapers reprinted Mr. Nakayama Yu's essays. Of course, this was not a waste of paper. Many Chinese readers had carefully read them, but what was the response to this article? Superficially, it may not have been as enthusiastic as Mr. Nakayama expected. However, I believe that in the bottom of the readers' hearts, there is indeed an unexpressed response. Whether there is disgust or resonance in this response, in short, it can still be admitted that Mr. Nakayama himself is truthful and sincere.</p>
<p>However, Mr. Nakayama's position, in addition to being personal, also has official duties, so even if he has sufficient truthfulness and sincerity, he cannot be free from various constraints. However, why are the figures in the Japanese intellectual circle, whose position is more free than Mr. Nakayama, silent on the Sino-Japanese issue in today's urgent situation?</p>
<p>A few years ago, the theories of East Asian Co-prosperity Sphere and integrated body were widely discussed, and Chinese magazines and newspapers also discussed them. However, now it seems like an era has passed. Apart from the speculation of the war situation, there is no construction of theory. It is said that Dr. Kada Tetsuji, who was temporarily regarded as a theorist of co-prosperity in Japan, recently came to Shanghai. Apart from discussing the current economic problems or writing "The Character of Modern Japan," he did not publish any other grand texts. From this, it can be seen that Japanese thought and the Chinese people are no longer just saying what they want to say. They are quietly observing the current situation between China and Japan, and are gradually changing. In today's silence, it can be seen that they are preparing to speak truthfully and honestly. I hope that this guess is correct, and I hope that Japanese thought can quickly publish truthful and sincere opinions from silent reflection.</p>
<p>Also, it is said that Mr. Yoshiyama Toyu, who has been active in Shanghai's public opinion with long treatises in recent years, has returned to Shanghai from Japan. In Shanghai today, where prices are rising and the situation is complicated, of course, Mr. Yoshiyama has unavoidable remarks to make. Moreover, Mr. Yoshiyama has experienced the wartime homeland this time and has returned to Shanghai again, and his feelings are of course more profound. I hope that Mr. Yoshiyama can use his unique worldview to represent the Japanese intellectual circle and show his face again in China.</p>
<p>Three</p>
<p>Now is the season of plum rain, and the Japanese intellectual circle may also be brewing in depression. I hope that the Japanese intellectual circle, which bears the "knowing the machine is like a god," can bravely take on the responsibility, eliminate the embellishments of the past and the superior tone, and meet with Chinese readers with truthfulness and sincerity.</p>
<p>I deeply miss the Japanese intellectuals. If they can write words that are truthful and every word is to the point in today's urgent situation, they will be able to open a new path for the future of China and Japan.</p>
<p>I remember that Okakura Tenshin wrote "The Awakening of Japan" when the Russo-Japanese War was in full swing. Japan should now also have thinkers with the spirit and vision of Tenshin, who can, on the one hand, add to Tenshin's unseen current stage of "The Awakening of Japan," and on the other hand, realize Tenshin's first sentence of "The Ideal of the Orient," the famous teaching of "Asia is one."</p>

<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency telegram) – The Japanese Kure Naval Base announced at 11:30 AM on the 22nd that approximately 280 enemy B-29 aircraft, in formations of nine to thirty-two planes in nine echelons, invaded the Kure area from an altitude of five to six thousand meters between 9:30 AM and 11:40 AM on the 22nd, dropping bombs on military facilities before retreating southward. During the attack, the Japanese ground anti-aircraft fire fully demonstrated its power, and as of now, the confirmed results are as follows: eight planes shot down and three damaged in the Kure area, and one plane shot down in the Kochi area. Damage to Japanese facilities and naval vessels was slight.</p>
<p>Fukuoka Airfield and Ibaraki Airfield Attacked</p>
<p>Fukuoka, 23rd (Central News Agency telegram) – Approximately twenty enemy F6F fighter planes and seven rocket-powered P-38 fighter planes from the Okinawa base invaded from the direction of Koshiki Island in several formations at 7:40 AM on the 23rd, strafing airfields around Fukuoka and dropping bombs in mountainous areas of Nagasaki Prefecture before retreating southward at 8:30 AM.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency telegram) – At 12:30 PM on the 23rd, approximately seventy-five P-51 fighter planes, led by three B-29 aircraft, moved northward along the Izu Islands. The main force of fifty planes invaded the mainland near Mito and Kujukuri Beach, attacking airfields in Ibaraki Prefecture, and retreated from Kujukuri Beach at around 2:00 PM. There was almost no damage to the Japanese side.</p>
<p>Japanese Small and Medium-Sized Cities Possess Strong Resilience</p>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Correspondent's Telegram) – The American Air Force, which had been indiscriminately bombing large Japanese cities such as Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, Kobe, and Yokohama, has now gradually shifted its focus, successively devastating historically significant small and medium-sized cities such as Shizuoka, Fukuoka, Hamamatsu, and Kagoshima, changing their original appearance. In the future, enemy air raids on these small and medium-sized cities will continue with their characteristic insane and brutal nature. However, when we observe the demeanor of the small and medium-sized cities that have suffered these disasters, they are actually different from the disaster areas of large cities. The result is to inspire the Japanese people to exert their fighting spirit and accelerate production. Taking the emerging Shizuoka as an example, Shizuoka was originally a city with feminine beauty. Although it suffered a major fire in 1940 and an earthquake at the end of last year, it was able to rebuild itself into a magnificent city with a strong fighting spirit. On the 20th, the enemy dropped incendiary bombs on the city, as if raining down. When the alert was lifted at 4:00 AM, the police officers and police training school students waiting in the prefectural office were divided into several teams, one team heading into the city and the other towards the outskirts. The team heading into the city provided comprehensive assistance to the disaster victims. The teams heading towards the outskirts sped off on motorcycles or tricycles to summon the volunteer corps in the nearby towns and villages. The women's volunteer corps, loaded with rice balls, rode in trucks from the outskirts to Shizuoka City. The Shimizu City team was the first to arrive, followed by the fire and defense volunteer corps from Fujieda, Shimada, Numazu, and Mishima, who jointly carried out firefighting work. By around 4:00 PM that afternoon, all roads were cleaned and tidied up. The rice balls made by the women's volunteer corps were exceptionally abundant, and by around 9:00 AM, the disaster victims had each obtained warm rice balls for breakfast. The towns and villages nearby that had not suffered war damage also actively contributed, offering food. Resting places for the disaster victims were designated in the suburbs. As a result, Shizuoka Station was not in a state of chaos, and there were no special restrictions. At certain factories and ironworks of major military-industrial significance, more than 80% of the workers had settled their families with relatives and friends in the suburbs by that evening and returned to the factories, and production began on the 21st without delay. This air raid did cause considerable damage, but the citizens of Shizuoka did not waste a moment. From this, we can see the strong resilience of Japanese small cities.</p>

<h3>Agreement Reached on the Organization of Polish United Government</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency telegram) – According to an official Moscow announcement today: An agreement has been reached on the organization of the Polish United Government. The Polish National United Government will include representatives from the Polish Provisional Government, including Mr. Mikolajczyk, the former Prime Minister of the London Polish government, who will hold a very important seat.

<h3>Section Chief Shimada Reveals Enemy American Conspiracy Against Chongqing - Making Every Effort to Expand Sphere of Influence</h3>
<p>Colonel Shimada, head of the Shanghai Japanese Army Reporting Section, made the following statement at yesterday afternoon's press conference regarding the joint statement issued by the American diplomatic and military representatives stationed in Chongqing:</p>
<p>Joint Statement Desires to Cover Up</p>
<p>According to a Chongqing Central News Agency dispatch on June 20, the content of the joint statement issued by US Ambassador to Chongqing Hurley and US Military Commander in Chongqing Wedemeyer stated that the rumors that there were differences of opinion between ourselves and our subordinates, or even in public and private matters, were pure fabrications and that even if we have differing opinions, we will be able to resolve them satisfactorily. American diplomats and military representatives in China are currently working together diligently and will continue to do so in the future. Upon investigation, the sudden public announcement of this joint statement indicates that its contents are not as simple as they appear. The statement's attempt to strongly deny any discord between the two, or any differences of opinion between subordinates or in public and private matters, only reveals that the issue is not as simple as it seems. It is clear that since the appointment of Stilwell, there has been no complete agreement between the American diplomatic and military sides in Chongqing. At that time, Stilwell made strong demands to Chongqing, which were met with vigorous opposition from Chongqing and the American diplomatic mission. Wedemeyer's appointment seems to have eased the atmosphere slightly, but the issue has not yet been completely resolved.</p>
<p>American Military Observers in Chongqing's Power</p>
<p>When Stilwell was in office, the United States made every effort to expand its sphere of influence in Chongqing, both militarily and economically. For example, the American military stationed in Chongqing was often disliked by Chongqing, and the Chongqing army in the war zone repeatedly expressed dissatisfaction with the American soldiers' arrogance and comfortable lifestyle. The New York Times correspondent in Chongqing also clearly stated this. However, after Wedemeyer's arrival, he ignored the criticisms and, in mid-May, moved two American divisions in North Burma to Zhijiang, which marked the beginning of the American army's presence in Chongqing. Initially, the American army's arrogance in considering themselves superior white people was even greater, and at the same time, in order to defend the South, they even asked Chiang Kai-shek to blockade 60,000 Communist troops, which Chiang agreed to, creating the biggest political problem for Chongqing in recent months. Since the arrival of the US Tenth Army in Chongqing, Wedemeyer's direct negotiations with Chongqing on military matters have become even more stubborn. Chongqing has already severely criticized Stilwell in the past, but Wedemeyer seems to be gradually falling into Stilwell's footsteps, which shows the general intentions of the United States towards Chongqing. According to a Reuters dispatch on the 20th, Wedemeyer decided to establish an American tactical command in the Chinese theater of war, which is proof of American aggression. Regarding the issue of lending military supplies to Chongqing, Wedemeyer has the right to speak when Chongqing can use them, and Yan'an has recently expressed strong dissatisfaction with Chongqing's rent-seeking military supplies. The American diplomatic mission in Chongqing has been contacting the Chongqing government to tolerate it temporarily.</p>
<p>Enemy American Conspiracy is Quite Obvious</p>
<p>According to the agreement on the plan to assist the Chongqing army in reorganization by the American military stationed in Chongqing, the purpose is to strengthen the Chongqing army. He Yingqin is the commander, and the American side has appointed McLoghlin to assist He. However, according to a New York newspaper report, Stilwell opposed the transfer of the American military stationed in Burma to Chongqing to prevent the Yunnan Plateau, and also made statements regarding the use of internal war. Hurley, on the other hand, had to speak out for the Chongqing government. In short, based on this joint statement, the United States is superficially assisting Chongqing, but its conspiracy to regard China as an American colony is quite obvious. Therefore, it is difficult for the Chongqing government to obtain American agreement when it makes a claim.</p>

<h3>Banking and Money Industry Conference Decides to Stop Using Bank Drafts, Notice to All Banks and Firms Effective July 3</h3>
<p>The banking and money industry in this city previously faced a shortage of cash. The member banks and firms have been using bank drafts from the Union Treasury to make adjustments, but these drafts have been circulating in the market, transferred and accepted. There have been delays in presenting them for payment, and the amount is quite large. The bank drafts issued by each bank and firm have been insufficiently prudent, leading to frequent cases of counterfeit bank drafts in the market. Merchants have also taken the opportunity to discount them for profit, which is inappropriate. In order to strengthen the financial system and ensure security, a joint meeting of the banking and money industry was convened on the 20th of this month, jointly deciding to stop using bank drafts for interbank transactions starting from July 3. At the same time, the meeting also discussed the large amount of cash needed by each bank and firm for business operations in the future. After the理事长 and监事会 of the two industry associations discussed the detailed implementation rules for stopping the use of bank drafts, they were separately decided, and the银钱库 formulated six measures for stopping the use of bank drafts for interbank transactions, which were officially notified to all member banks and firms for compliance. Furthermore, this measure by the banking and money industry is of great importance to the interests of the clients of each bank and firm. It is also planned to notify all clients in the near future to facilitate business.</p>
<h3>Chen Shizhang Discusses Food Supply Issues in Shanghai, and Studies Adjustments to the Control System</h3>
<p>In order to strengthen the policy of controlling materials, the National Government decided to make stricter adjustments to the control policies for various major commodities in the second half of this year, so as to balance military and civilian needs and make operations smoother. It is also necessary to adjust the control mechanism. It is learned that Minister of Industry Chen has come to Shanghai recently and once studied the overall issue of adjusting the control mechanism with relevant parties, and made detailed discussions on various serious issues such as疏通 of rice sources and抑平 of commodity prices.</p>
<p>Freight Car Transportation of Rice Reduces Freight Charges</p>
<p>After the National Government implemented emergency rice countermeasures to stop purchasing and revoke shipping restrictions, the supply of civilian rice has become more smoothly, and rice prices have stopped rising and fallen back. The Central China Transportation Group (Central China Railway), in order to assist this countermeasure, decided to reduce freight charges for freight car transportation of rice by 20% starting from June 24, so as to make rice transportation smoother and relieve the Shanghai citizens' food supply panic.</p>
<h3>Stamp Tax Bureau Prohibits Underpayment of Stamp Tax</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Stamp Tax Bureau of Tobacco and Alcohol, because the merchants in the city do not issue receipts for daily door-to-door transactions, underpaying stamp tax, or even issue invoices without affixing stamp tax, has become a common practice. Previously, merchants were repeatedly advised to comply with regulations and affix stamp tax in full, and not to neglect it, so as to重視 national tax and avoid punishment. However, since April 15 of this year, when the Finance Bureau of the Municipal Government stipulated the filling out of special tax invoices, merchants have often misinterpreted this, thinking that filling out special tax invoices for customers exempts them from affixing stamp tax. There are even those who fill out self-made double-form invoices stamped with the Finance Bureau's seal, neither handing them over to customers nor actually affixing stamp tax, thinking that they can be used for checking special taxes. There are many tricks to evade taxes, which is very wrong and should be corrected immediately. Therefore, all merchants are once again warned that whether they fill out special tax invoices stipulated by the Finance Bureau or self-made double-form invoices for door-to-door sales, they must comply with the regulations to affix stamp tax in full, and absolutely must not omit any. If they continue to violate this deliberately, or deliberately do not issue invoices, once discovered, they will be transferred to the court and fined 500 times the amount of tax evaded, according to the recently passed tax evasion penalties of the National Defense Conference.</p>
<h3>Summer Health Movement to Open Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The city's health authorities, in order to ensure the health of citizens in the summer, have decided to hold a health campaign in accordance with the central government's regulations, so as to promote public health. Preparations are actively underway and are now ready. The opening ceremony is scheduled to be held at the Nanjing Grand Theatre at 9:00 AM on the 25th of this month. Leading Baotian personnel and other personnel from various agencies will hold a major cleanup. From the same day to the 30th, the Health Exhibition will be held at the Youth Association on Ningxia Road at the same time, open to the public for visiting. Every night at 8:00 PM, health experts will be invited to give special lectures in the auditorium of the Youth Association. The topics are as follows: Day 1: Leprosy, Day 2: Tuberculosis Prevention, Day 3: Summer Health Knowledge, Day 4: Nutrition, Day 5: Typhoid and Dysentery, Day 6: Rabies. Those who wish to attend the lectures can first obtain admission tickets from the Youth Association Exhibition. Hygiene movies will be shown from 9:00 PM to 10:00 PM.</p>
<h3>City School Staff Salaries to be Changed to One Bag of Flour</h3>
<p>The Economic Bureau has scheduled the distribution of salary rice certificates for the municipal schools,馆 teaching staff, and staff for May and the first half of June from the 23rd of this month to July 6th. The city's education bureau issued all the above salary rice certificates from the 20th to the 23rd. It is learned that the Economic Bureau approved the issuance of one bag of No. 1 flour per person for the salary rice of the staff of each school and馆 in April, and it is also scheduled to be issued at the Qimen Road Public Sales Office from the 23rd of this month to July 6th. The City Education Bureau has scheduled to issue the second batch of salary rice certificates from the 25th to the 27th. Each school and馆 should immediately fill out the sales report and the总收据, each on one sheet, according to the on-duty staff in April, and receive the second batch of salary rice certificates from the Education Bureau, transfer them to each staff member, and take them to the Qimen Road Public Sales Office. Each certificate can be used to get a bag of flour for free.</p>
<h3>Establishment of Consumer Supply Society to Improve the Lives of Civil Servants</h3>
<p>In order to improve the lives of civil servants, the Shanghai Municipal Government, in addition to planning to find ways to increase加　 from July, has also decided to establish a "Civil Servant Consumption Supply Society." The plan is for the municipal government to provide funds to purchase relatively　 affordable daily necessities to distribute to civil servants within the government. It is learned that the municipal government has appointed Deputy Secretary-General Hu Zewu as the director of the society to prepare for everything, with the aim of officially establishing it by the end of June.</p>
<h3>Industrial and Commercial Registration Must Not be Delegated</h3>
<p>The City Economic Bureau has been very strict in handling industrial and commercial registration since it started handling it itself. It has recently been rectified to make it more meticulous. It is heard that all industrial and commercial firms in this city who need to apply for registration must go directly to the bureau to apply, and must not delegate or　辦, so as to 核发 the certificate quickly, and to prevent all kinds of abuses. It has recently been heard that one or two trade associations claim that they can handle the registration on behalf of the firms. This is not true. It is hoped that all industrial and commercial circles in this city will pay attention to this in order to avoid losses.</p>
<h3>China Salt Industry Company to Close at End of Month</h3>
<p>The China Salt Industry Company of this city, which specializes in managing salt collection and transport in the Central China region, has decided to cease all operations by the end of this month due to changes in the financial authorities' management methods for salt transport and sales.</p>
<h3>News Association Held Current Affairs Lecture Yesterday - Captain Matsumoto and Others Gave Speeches</h3>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the China News Association held a current affairs lecture yesterday (the 23rd) at 5:00 PM at the Cathay Hotel. Captain Matsumoto of the Allied Fleet Press Department, as well as Mr. Akiyama and Mr. Uzaki, were invited to speak. Captain Matsumoto, Mr. Akiyama, and Mr. Uzaki were specially invited to attend. They were received by Chen Binhe, Chairman of the Branch Council, and Chen Riping, Director and Secretary-General of the Council. Over 500 guests from the cultural and educational sectors attended.</p>
<p>Chairman's Address</p>
<p>First, Chairman Chen Riping delivered an opening address, stating: "The current war situation is becoming increasingly urgent, especially the battle on the eastern sea of Okinawa. The enemy Americans have invaded Okinawa and have been fighting for over eighty days. The Japanese army is bravely resisting, causing significant damage to the enemy Americans. The deaths of important commanders such as General Buckner, commander of the US Tenth Army, and Acting Division Commander Ishlai of the 96th Division, who participated in the Okinawa campaign, show the fierceness of the offensive and defensive battles at the time. However, in the past, we have only seen this situation in the newspapers. To give everyone a detailed understanding and recognition of the current situation, we have specially invited Captain Matsumoto and Mr. Akiyama and Mr. Uzaki, who are involved in Allied reporting."</p>
<p>Lecture Circumstances</p>
<p>Mr. Uzaki and Mr. Akiyama then delivered clear lectures on the trends after the Okinawa battle and the possibility of mainland China operations. They estimated the time it would take for the enemy's American forces in Europe to move to Asia, pointing out their attempt to use Chinese manpower to fight against Japan. The latter also elaborated on the difficulties of transporting American aid to the Chongqing army, pointing out that the materials were scarce. Based on the enemy Americans' troop strength, he considered their mainland China operations to be a natural course of action, but cautioned that we should pay attention to the dangerous schemes behind it and take strict precautions. Finally, Captain Matsumoto gave a speech entitled "The Destiny of East Asia and the Mission of Youth." After the speech, a musical film was shown, and the meeting adjourned after three hours.</p>
<p>Captain Matsumoto's Speech</p>
<p>The past and future developments of the Pacific war situation have already been clarified by Mr. Akiyama and Mr. Uzaki, so there is no need for further explanation. I will focus on examining the future of East Asia and the mission of youth. Originally, Asian nations were rural communal societies, living in harmony with nature. It was only after the introduction of European and American culture that they became modern, English-American style societies. Of course, in addition to the harm, the so-called European and American culture also has many aspects that can develop Oriental culture. However, the methods and paths by which China and Japan accepted European and American culture were inappropriate, leading them astray into "making a living under English and American culture."</p>
<p>English and American Forces Promoted Conflict</p>
<p>The reason for the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese Incident in 1937 was, in essence, caused by the struggle between the different English and American forces in China and Japan. Now that the Sino-Japanese Incident has occurred, in order to resolve it, we must urgently eradicate the remaining English and American forces in both countries. Therefore, Japan promoted the incident under this subject, so the Greater East Asia War was launched, which is also an inevitable historical phenomenon. Japan's most important objectives in fighting against England and the United States were to destroy England and the United States and to resolve the Sino-Japanese problem, eliminating the English and American forces in Japan. However, in the early stages of the Greater East Asia War, after the Japanese army gained considerable victories in the Pacific, the country forgot the important task of "resolving the Sino-Japanese problem and eliminating the English and American forces in the country." As such, Japan's understanding of the evolution of the situation was lacking, leading to the situation from the start of the American counter-offensive in 1942 to the present.</p>
<p>At this point, the Japanese people and leaders began to repeatedly consider the necessity of researching and solving the Sino-Japanese problem and adjusting the domestic situation, and began to work hard. As the saying goes, "Worry and hard work can revitalize a country," and Japan is just like that.</p>
<p>At the same time, when we look at China again, there is the National Government and the two regimes of Chongqing and Yan'an, forming a tripartite balance of power. Now Japan is seriously observing and trying to find appropriate ways to solve and adjust various problems. With a sincere and introspective attitude, we are moving forward on a new path, and we have great expectations for China's efforts and struggles. At this time of transition, we should recall Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Pan-Asianism, and not let the war situation confuse our vision. We should work realistically for the path that should be followed in the future.</p>
<p>Chinese and Japanese Youth Work Together</p>
<p>In the future, those who will truly bear the responsibility of leading Greater East Asia are the Chinese nation and the Japanese nation. Since the 17th century, in order to support world culture, two world wars have occurred, and now we are on the verge of destruction. German Dr. Stepaula said: "European culture is gradually declining, and a new culture will rise from the Pacific, bringing the light of dawn to the whole of Asia. That is China and Japan, and the driving force is the youth of China and Japan, youth with excellent ideas." There is a Japanese saying: "Young students should study hard and play hard." But in addition, they should have ambitions for the current situation and future of China, so that they can become a community for the revival of East Asia and the construction of East Asia in the future. We believe that the above are common tasks for China and Japan to work together.</p>
<h3>Special Gold Tax to be Levied from July 1st - 0.5% to be Levied on the Actual Transaction Amount</h3>
<p>In order to enrich the city treasury revenue, the Shanghai Special Municipal Government formulated temporary measures for levying a special tax on gold. These measures have been submitted to the Executive Yuan, then to the Supreme National Defense Council for approval, and have been publicly announced by the Yuan and ordered to be implemented by the Municipal Finance Bureau. A gold special tax collection committee has also been established. It is now known that the date for the collection of the gold special tax has been set for July 1st. The tax rate will be 0.5% of the actual transaction amount, with half collected from the buyer and half from the seller. It is also known that gold securities will not be taxed because they are issued by the state.</p>
<p>Registration of Gold Trading Businesses</p>
<p>There is no organization for gold trading businesses in this city, so they should be managed and rectified. The registration of management matters for trading businesses has been ordered by the Municipal Government to be handled separately by the Economic Bureau and the Finance Bureau. Standards for registration and licensing have been drafted in accordance with Article 2 of the published regulations, and registration is required within a limited time for management purposes. In the future, all gold trading businesses operating in the city, whether or not they have been registered in the past, must apply for registration and licensing in accordance with the regulations. However, this is limited to those who have operated gold businesses, and outsiders are not allowed to apply, in order to show restrictions and avoid speculation.</p>
<p>Changning Police Bureau Seizes Black Market Tickets</p>
<p>Yao Benyuan, the head of the Changning District Police Branch in this city, has strictly ordered his subordinates to pay close attention to the police stationed at the four stations in the jurisdiction, and to report any illegal activities of black marketeers and the oppression of the people by black market tickets. At around 4:00 PM on the 23rd of this month, Zhou, a patrolling officer stationed at the station, discovered that Tan Ma, Ma Hu, Han, and Jiang, three female third-class passengers who were going to Jiaxing, were holding tickets purchased from the black market. Upon questioning, it was revealed that they had been purchased from the black marketeer Hu Jinke for 4,000 yuan each, a price clearly from the black market. The criminal Hu was immediately arrested and transferred to the District Procuratorate for handling. The money defrauded from the victims was returned in full by the management bureau.</p>
<p>County Management Office Urges Compilation of County Administration Reports</p>
<p>The County Administration Office previously stated that the content of the work reports sent by the counties and districts was scattered, the descriptions were not detailed enough, and the formats were inconsistent. In order to achieve uniformity, a table of contents for the administration overview was specified, and all were instructed to comply, re-draft, and submit the report for verification within one week of receiving the document. Now, it has been found that the above reports have been overdue for a long time and have not yet been submitted, which is a serious delay. The office is now about to draft a four-month work report since its establishment. All administrative situations in the counties, as well as relevant survey tables, are to be included separately. Therefore, another order is issued urging the detailed drafting of the administration overview report in accordance with the previously received table of contents, and it must be submitted for verification within five days of receiving the document, without delay.</p>

<h3>Private School Teachers and Staff Eagerly Await Special Rice Allocation</h3>
<p>It is a well-known fact that teachers and staff in education lead a hard life. Therefore, they have gained the sympathy of the public, and they have also received decent treatment from the authorities, giving them the same treatment as civil servants, enjoying key allocations. Employees of regional private schools can receive a special allocation of three *dou* of rice per month.</p>
<p>However, in reality, three *dou* per month has never been received. Moreover, since the supplementary issuance of one *dou* and five *sheng* for the first half of March (thirteenth period) in mid-May, more than a month has passed, and there has been no news of continued issuance.</p>
<p>At a time when prices are rising crazily, the salary of teachers and staff for a semester is only enough to buy one *dou* of rice - or even less than one *dou*. Without the enjoyment of special rice allocations, how can they maintain their lives?</p>
<p>Police officers and municipal school employees have already been given their salary rice for June. Why is it that employees of private schools have not yet received the allocation for the second half of March, causing general employees to be greatly threatened by their livelihoods!</p>
<p>Currently, schools have begun final exams, and teachers and staff are relatively busy. They hope that the authorities will consider their hard lives and issue the special rice allocation for private school teachers and staff in advance, and hope to make up for April, May, and June, in order to stabilize the lives of more than 10,000 people, and prevent them from neglecting their duties during this end-of-semester period due to worrying about their lives. This is the utmost hope. (Jin Yuan)</p>
<h3>Commemorating the Seventh-Seventh Memorial Service - Donations to Help the Needy</h3>
<p>Reader Hasegawa Gitaro from Allied Nations writes: "Dear Sir, I am writing to inform you that on the occasion of the seventh-seventh day after my late wife's death, I am sending 50,000 yuan in savings, which I would like you to distribute to your charity funds for poverty relief, small education medical aid, small capital loans, medical aid, and childbirth assistance, 10,000 yuan each, to help the needy and to leave a memorial." Hasegawa's enthusiasm for charitable deeds is worthy of admiration.</p>
<h3>Origins of the Student Mutual Aid Association</h3>
<p>Seeing the increasing number of young people dropping out of school, well-known figures in this city, including Lin Kangyi, Yuan Ludeng, and Shen Siliang, have sponsored the development of welfare programs. The origins of the association are recorded below: "Prices are rising, and life is becoming more difficult, especially for the education sector, which has been greatly affected. As the ancients said, 'Saving the dying leaves no time to govern rites and righteousness.' What the world sees is mostly short-term gains and quick success, while the education that forms the foundation of the country is often ignored. However, there is also the hardship of helplessness. The greatest desire of people is to survive. Only when the conditions for survival are complete can one attend to other things. It has never been heard that starving to death is a small matter, and dropping out of school is a big matter. Moreover, in addition to the tuition and miscellaneous fees collected by schools, the students themselves also have to bear significant expenses. Therefore, the burden on parents is heavier, the number of students dropping out of school is increasing, and the cultural level is declining. Seeing this, we and others have received generous donations from enthusiastic people in this city and enthusiastic support from various organizations, so we have formed this association, contributing our meager efforts, calling for support from all parties, and further expecting our classmates to participate in order to seek mutual assistance. As for the current plans of the association, there are student clubs and student announcements."</p>
