<h3>日各地制空部隊　對敵展開邀繫戰　硫磺島昨晨遭敵艦砲射擊</h3>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　日大本營十六日下午六時三十分發表：有力之敵機動部隊，出現於日本近海，自十六日上午七時左右至下午四時許，以其艦載機主力對關東地方及靜崗縣下之日飛機塲，實施波狀攻繫，日軍制空部隊於各地對此敵展開邀繫戰，收得相當之戰果。　包括戰艦及航空母艦三十餘艘組成之敵艦隊自十六日晨對硫磺島實施艦砲射繫中。</p>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　敵美之機動部隊，目一月末於台灣，菲律實近海出現以來，十六日復出現於日本近海，而以其艦載機對日本本土作最初之大舉轟炸。同時，以包括戰艦及航空母艦三十餘艘組成之敵機動部隊，自十六日晨起對日本太平洋戰綫之前衛據硫磺島，實施艦砲射繫中。按出現於日本近海之敵機動部隊。爲目下敵美在太平洋海域擁有海上勢力之主力，以航空母艦十餘艘爲基幹，來襲日本土，敵艦載機總機數，其達一千架以上。敵美以此大量之量之艦載機來製日本土，同時，對硫磺島實施艦砲射艦砲射繫之事實，證明敵軍將於最近企圖在硫磺島展開登陸者，當不難推測。今敵機動部隊仍避弋於日本近海，其艦載機於十七日或將再度空製日本本土，敵軍企圖制壓硫磺島地區，在戰略上意義有二：　硫磺島日軍攻繫敵美馬利亞納基地之據點，當B29型空製日本本土時，屢遭硫磺島日軍監視綱迅速探悉，損失重大，故有佔領之必要。　敵軍若佔領硫磺島後，可作協助Ｂ29型之戰鬥機之基地，當十六日敵艦載機空襲日本本土時，曾以B29型一架數次來製後，始有大規模之空襲，此次復以艦載戰鬥機爲主力，傾力空襲日空軍基地，並對軍事設施及交通綫，火車，船舶等加以射繫，然由於日空軍完壁之防禦，故各方之損害至爲輕微。</p>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　十五日有B29型敵機約六十架來覆日本名古屋，靜崗及三重縣，日防空部隊當起邀繫，經調查結果，敵機十七架受損害，日機一軻未返。</p>
<h3>菲島作戰　敵美損害慘重　松島部長談太平洋戰局</h3>
<p>邦日本駐華艦隊報道部循例於昨日（十六日）下午三時，會見本市各報新聞記者，由松島部長新自主持，對馬尼剌日軍奮勇作戰及敵美在太平洋方面作戰之困難，有所闡述。誌其談話概要如次：</p>
<p>呂宋敵軍遭受重創</p>
<p>松島部長首談菲律賓戰局略謂：呂宋島馬尼剌，聖白羅斯山脈，及班班等處，均有劇戰，其中尤以馬尼剌市間，戰事最爲劇烈。敵人第三十七師團第一騎兵團撥從北方進攻入市，但此項部隊尙未能與第十一空挺隊及其他部隊取得連絡。日本陸軍及海重陸戰隊在巴西克河南岸邀繫敵人，使敵人出血。關於此方面之苦戰，據敵人發表其作戰上難以進展之理由有三：　由於日軍砲繫之正確，　因市內各處均埋有地雷，　須保護美人及外僑，以致作戰大受牽制。日軍不時渡巴西克河，向敵陣衝鋒，破壞其防禦工事，使遭受巨創，心胆俱寒。目下馬尼刺區最後爭奪戰之塲所爲巴西克河及海岸一帶，日軍之堅强抵抗，使敵美遭受重創，敵人承認菲島作戰所受之損害，實爲前此所未有。由此觀之，敵美在人力及物力上損失，誠有不可計算者矣。</p>
<p>大陸作戰困難重重</p>
<p>太平洋上敵美艦隊之根據地，刻已由尼米資移設關島，今後即以此地爲海上作戰之基地，並已有一部份空軍往炸琉璜島及小笠原羣島等地，敵人對於太平洋之戰局，曾一再透露謂呂宋島之戰事，實殊艱鉅，今後尙須假以時日。觀此則知對於中國之大陸作戰，一時更未能實現，因其物資方面之準備，非倉猝間所能完成者也。據二月十三日紐約泰晤士報載稱，蔣介石已與美國約定在不久之將來，將對中國沿岸地區之日軍，發動大規模之反攻，但因去年日軍之猛烈作戰，此次反攻計劃，已顯然成爲泡影。美軍如欲在中國大陸作戰，實予待機已久之數百萬日軍，以繫滅敵人之良好機會。敵美大陸作戰，實爲非常冒險之舉動，預料美軍於未發動此項計劃之前，必儘先在太平洋攻佔若干小島以爲宣傳大陸作戰之先聲。</p>
<p>日海空軍待機作戰</p>
<p>日本海軍之作戰，不論敵人來自何方面，始終有其一貫之方針。日海軍之精銳艦隊及空軍，均等待機會欲與敵人接近。十五日紐約泰晤士報合衆社電讀云，松島大佐廣播稱，日海軍艦隊决不避免與美軍作正面之衝突戰，日海軍之作戰方針如何，盜可知矣。</p>
<p>關於歐洲戰局蘇年業已渡過沃特河，稍有進展，惟德軍七氣仍極旺盛，勇往作戰，始終不懈，上次英美蘇三國會談終了時，曾涉及處分德國之計劃，此訊發表後，德國人民實無動搖之跡象，蓋其決心奮鬥，實百折而不撓也</p>
<p>中日協力保衛上海</p>
<p>最近滬上因一部份日軍及其家屬等之移動，若干人心理間似有不安之象，實則上海市在中日雙方增强戰力之協力下，已抱一致死守之決心，市民實無須乎有不安之感覺也。我人觀察上海一部份無知識者，正在作等待美人回來之迷夢，此種人實已忘却中華過去之光輝，及其不可慶滅之歷史。菲島戰事發生後，美軍已三次對菲人茶攝毒，發生慘劇，滬人之等待美軍到來者，可以作爲殷鑒。最近中國報紙上載有昂揚民放自決精神及振與國家之論文，殊感欣幸。中日兩國必須協力，成爲一體，防禦侵略，保衛國土，俾民衆在生活上獲得安定，日本對此決盡其全力以完成之。據聞蔣介石現方抱恙休養。希望其在病榻上爲東亞將來及民衆福利多多着想，並對今後中日兩國完全協力，以期東亞新生之實現一點，三致其意。</p>
<p>本人於舊曆歲首見市上中國青年男女愉快之狀，爲過去所未覩，衷心亦覺快慰，而過去三日中，電燈電車電影，又延長供應進間，使大家獲得觀娛。假如美軍侵入，則此類事實，殆成夢想矣。凡一國國民最高之責任。即爲保衛其國家，及維持並增進民衆之福利，滬人茍以爲美軍能於此和平之狀態下到來者，實屬大誤，須知美軍如在大陸作戰，第一步其本身即將遭殃耳。上海爲中日兩國人士心的故鄕，亦鄧重慶或延安方面一班人心的故鄕，因此不能單獨認爲中國一方面的經濟都市，爲保衛此故鄕起見，中日變方必須協力不惜犧甡也。</p>
<h3>日文學報國會　決定本年計劃</h3>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　日文學報國會，最近召開大東亞文學者大會第二次處理委員會，出席者計有委員長與善郞氏，豐島與志雄氏，高見順氏，土屋文明氏及中村事務局長等，就該會基礎，正式决定計劃如左：　爲建設大東亞文化尊重古典，更爲刋行貫通東洋古典，强化道義精神之大東亞古典全書日語譯本及各國語譯本，特於事務局內設立翻譯團。　爲謀充分利用演劇，定本年秋季舉行大東亞演劇者大會。　爲謀大東亞文化之推進，各國互派詩人文學者。　以中日滿親善爲文化交流之適當方法，以漢詩爲中心，組織文化聯盟。　設立大東亞文藝院，以爲樹立大東亞文化活潑且有秩序的推進機關。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>物價的評議與管理</h3>
<p>當前的物價問題，無可諱言的，超越了經濟的範圍，而是政治上重大的難關。物價在戰爭時期雖然不免要時時引起波動，可是在我國因爲統制經濟之未久正軌，形成了空前的暴漲現象。這個原因，當然在物價管理之外，另有其他中因素，但物價迄今仍無合理的管制，實亦毋可諱言。</p>
<p>此次本市政人事的刷新，一般對於決戰關頭後方民生之安定期待甚殷，經濟當局爲達到此一目的起見，一方面旣將物價評議會改組，一方面又修正其組織規程，此種措置固足以一新吾人耳目。然而我們認爲物價的評定，際此非常時期，除了斟酌商情市况，貨物成本以外，如對目前混亂的物價期收澄淸之效，更須用快刀斬亂蔴的精神，以某項主要物品爲基準，或以某日之物價爲基準，作爲限價的根據，規定以後不輕易變更。否則，此項斟酌及評議，恐亦不能避免其重蹈過去的覆轍。</p>
<p>當此非常時期，任何制度或法令，如無强力而簡速之推行，即反足以造成種種舞弊之源。我們不能即謂革新以後，已決無顧此失彼之處。因此欲求物價之穏定，不但求其價格之評定，更須嚴密其物價之管理。換言之，即對於一切任意抬高物價之行爲，必須予以斷然的嚴重處置。本市各物的物價市况，大都操於各物市塲，今後經濟保安當局，對於此種物價提高的發源地，必須力求整飭。尤其各業同業公會的組織及管理，也應從速加以强化。</p>
<p>昨天物價評議會舉行評議員曁專門委員聯席會議，決定將十六種商品審議成本與售價，幷於今日籨具意見，然後由評議委員會作最後決定。不久以後，對於主要商品即將決定新限價，對於穏定物價，自有相當期待。不過，根據過去經騐，評議物價完全是消極工作，如查得不到嚴密監督與嚴格執行，則評定物價　爲形式，因此外問題過去對於主管機構嘖有煩言，今後希望評義與執行監督成爲一元化，評議工作成爲管理物價中的前提工作。這樣，才能促成評議工作爲積極性，而對整個物價收獲穏定實效。</p>

<h3>南滙拾零</h3>
<p>— 逸飛</p>
<p>記者二月前離南匯時，該縣縣政當局正微用民田，建築公路，以期發展交通，繁榮市面，流通都市與農村之物資，此舉對目前之環境，實屬切要，且對戰時防務，貢獻亦大。如從大處着想，雖因田畝微衛上之亮別而使農民遭受若干損失。但亦未可厚非。</p>
<p>公路建設</p>
<p>不圖昔日計劃之六大幹綫，當時雷國風行，限期完工者，至今僅一區黃家路至老港，二區江鎭至陸家路，八區大圍至彭蜞廟數段。其餘諸綫：如祝橋至周浦，御橋至塘橋，北蔡至川沙三幹綫，工程皆吿停頓。完成者亦未見利用通車，任其自然　陷。究其因，實以南匯境內河道縱橫，所需橋梁之建築材料至多，値此非常時期物資遵節之秋，勢有困難，致工程停頓。深盼縣當局予以設法，俾得早竟全工，庶免功虧一簣。</p>
<p>又現下各路線行駛之車輛，除周浦至大團段有滬南長途汽車公司之卡車外，僅有東亞公司之小汽車。前者祗每日一班，且以車輛過少，駛用頻繁，常有拋錨之事，事實上不敷需要甚鉅，而後者票價昂貴，令人咋舌，由東昌路至周浦，已達兩千金，由東昌路直放大團，每人須萬金。如是票價，平民殊無力問津。深望將來公路全部完成，當局能自行組織健全之交通機關，票價務求大衆化，俾使克盡義務之農民，亦能享受一二。</p>
<p>合作事業　南匯合作支社，孫由「行政院合作事業委員會」管理，接受該委員會「上海地區連絡事務所」之支配。成立於三十二年九月一日，目前共有社員四萬一千四百三十人，社內資金四百二十萬元。社員繳納資金，每戶六十元，又儲金二十元。首任社和爲李堯禎，旅即去職，後由曾任當地區長之王秀賢繼任，終以事屬初創，兼以社員十九爲農民，對合作事業缺乏認識，多不感興趣，其所以加入，泰半受鄕鎭長之强制，而事後又對社務概不過問。（一方面亦因智識），又鄕民本希望加入後，可得廉價之配給物品，事實上，則又難以如願，鄕民於是兪感失望。該社以本身開支浩大，又不知利用資金，充作生產費用，致成坐吃山空之勢。記者客歲十月十旬初抵南城，曾往該社考察，已見社務停頓，負責無人，後由鄕紳張世驊氏接事，奈以困難重重，不易着手，僅月餘即行吿退。</p>
<p>茲悉該社已於客歲十一月二十九日，召開社員代表大會，計共到代表三十六名，缺席者僅八名，當時曾由各機關派員列席，實行監督改組，當塲選定鄕紳葉秉衛氏，擔任理事長兼社長，並將支社移往周浦鎭。而南匯城內則設該社「南匯城廂出張所」。今日記者所希望者，爲：</p>
<p>增加資金　該社原有之資金於移交時，幾已消耗殆盡，祗餘五十萬金，僅原數九分之一，區區此數，實難有所作爲，應切實勸導農民，介紹親友入會，俾增實力，一面對舊社員亦訂定獎勵辦法，同時勸其增加原有資金。　努力配給該社之配給，雖開始迄今已經逾年半，而實際配給僅五次，且數量至少，不啻怀水車薪，於事無濟。應增加配量次數及數量，以資鼓勵。　舉辦農貸，目下農村經濟枯竭，合作社努力農貸事務，代與農民以晨具耕牛種子等，其他如創辦實騐進塲，附辦「互助會」，提倡集團生活，如一一舉辦，則過去奄奄一息之南匯合作事業必有復蘇之一日，前途正未可限象也。</p>
<p>年景荒凉</p>
<p>當今農村商人實仍以廢曆年終爲結算之期，往年鎭上，採辦年貨，市面與隆，今年則遠不如昔，除五洋雜貨店門可羅雀我，南貨店亦顧客凋零。從此可反映農村經濟之敝疲，與大衆購買力之薄一斑。</p>

<h3>日軍在呂宋島　實行衝殺戰　馬尼剌南部敵受重創</h3>
<p>呂宋前綫十五日中央社電　呂宋戰綫之敵軍大勢，係側重于馬尼剌之攻陷，蓋麥克沃塞最初之計劃即如是，試觀敵將武器彈藥在仁牙因及薩發昂等地上陸，現馬尼剌戰塲之中心。仍在貫市街中央之巴西克河南側一帶及舊城區域，我此等地區仍在日軍掌握中。又侵入加達培方面之敵軍，嗣漸次增加兵力，十一日曾以戰車與步兵三十名來襲，其中一部直趨貢吉列方面另一部則進攻邳根方面，斯時馬吉列西方及尼科拉斯飛行塲之日本陸海軍精銳當即邀繫，一部敵軍目十一日深夜侵入馬尼剌南部之巴戊後，至翌日晨爲止，曾遭日軍衝鋒隊之衝繫，受損甚重。十二日上午一時前後，敵曾砲繫馬吉列，直至十三日仍未稍息，然守該地之日軍仍未搖動，在邦苛附近屢次展開白刃戰，雙方激戰正酣。又侵入尼科拉斯非飛機塲附近之敵軍亦被繫退，克拉克費特地區之戰事逐汽車激烈，敵軍自九日以來，即先以砲繫掩護，次以戰車十數　爲先鋒，反復進攻日軍冀及中央陣地，因此日軍右冀乃退到第二綫陣地，然中央方面之日軍，仍固守第一綫陣地，該地敵軍受損甚巨，英第三十師團因日軍累次之猛攻，致出血甚多，目前仁牙因正面並甚大變動。敵艦砲射繫時斷時續，僅桑霍塞附近之敵軍比較活躍，日軍乘此敵方攻勢緩慢之際，日夜實行衝殺戰術，即以八日至十一日之戰果而言，已殺傷敵兵一千五百餘名，此外，並破毀敵戰車四輛，火砲八門，迫繫砲三十門，機關槍多數，載重汽車三十餘輛，帳幕三十五處，軍需品倉庫十一處，同時並截獲各種子彈一萬發，迫繫砲十門，速射砲三門，重機五挺，輕機二十五挺，自動步槍及電話機等甚夥。</p>
<h3>爪哇中參院　增加議員額</h3>
<p>爪加爾達十六日中央社電　日軍政監部於本月二十日如開第一次中央參議院會議，開會之前决定將原有之議員二十六名（原額二十八名缺二名）再增加二十名，業於十一日正式發表任命。按此次擋置與過去之增額不同，蓋此次之新議員中包括所有阿拉伯美那多安本等混血種民族，意在團結束印度，一致力謀獨立，使各民族之總力擴充參政之範團。</p>
<h3>渝美機襲京　繫落毀三架</h3>
<p>南京十六日中央社電　渝美空軍P51型三架，十六日下午一時五十三分侵入首都上空，經盟邦防空區部隊猛烈砲輩，擊落二架，隧落地點，尙未判明。其爲避他一架亦被繫毀，我方並無損害。</p>

<h3>太平洋戰綫上　日孤立部隊活躍　堅守崗位不屈不撓　美軍對之深爲恐怖</h3>
<p>關於拉巴爾日本守備部隊的「明朗敢鬥」情况，日本方面早發表，最近瑞典報紙會刋載關於太平洋及歐洲兩戰區日德兩軍「孤立部隊」的紐約特派員電訊，其文幾全部爲關於太平洋日本孤軍的描寫，茲摘要譯述於後：</p>
<p>牽掣美軍　無論在太平洋或歐洲，在反軸心軍戰線的背後，至今猶有日軍或德軍在孤立無援的狀况下，確保重要陣地，採取强力的防禦勢態。這些軍隊，一點沒有降伏的徵兆。雖說是孤立的，但是，他們的友重固不必說，就是他們的敵手也未曾忘記他們的存在。美軍對他們正繼續不斷從海空方面加以攻繫，換一句話說，爲使這些部隊不能參加主要戰塲起見，美國不得不用相當的兵力防範他們。在這個事實中，就可看出這些孤軍的存在價値。直到今日，仍非繼續對他們反復攻繫不可。美軍最近已實際經騐到這一點了。蓋拉巴爾方面日軍，不僅將其炸壞的飛機塲修好，並且將已損壞的飛機也重行修好，對附近的美軍行根據地作報復性質的轟炸。這些日軍守備隊，一直用無線電與東京連絡，有時並用舟艇及其他手段實行突破封鎖線。他們依靠舟艇的補給，可以獲得種種給養品，如醫藥品，壓縮食糧，彈藥等等。他們差不多均能得到充分的彈藥補給。</p>
<p>食糧自給</p>
<p>某島的日本守備隊，食糧頗苦不足，因爲該島幾乎合部是不毛之地，可以耕種的地方極少，所以不能生產足够的食糧。但其他島嶼上的守備隊，特別是布根維爾，新幾內亞的日軍，已本所需糧食自足的信念，開始大規模耕種了。美機時時在此等耕種地帶撤布毒液，用各種方法加以妨害。此等孤軍中，拉巴爾守備隊尤爲優秀，保有許多彈藥。又，新幾內亞沿海一帶，迄今猶在軍手中，而且他們完全沒有情甘降伏的預兆。澳軍幾時敢在那地帶展開掃蕩戰呢？不知道。澳軍說，暫時聽任他們也不至於成爲極大的危險，實際上正足表明澳軍的恐怖。澳軍司令勃萊梅曾述這些孤立的日軍狀况道：「從新幾內亞到所羅門，各地日軍已着手在廣大的地域內種稻，並已開始飼養家畜了。」</p>
<p>反軸心軍對於散布其戰綫背後廣大區域中的日軍部隊，常須嚴加警戒。爲什麼呢？因爲一不留意時，這些孤軍竟完成自給勢態，而逐漸點頭復攻繫力，那就麻煩了。這事反軸心軍在過去已有實際的經騐。如果東印度羣島也孤立起來時，監視問題將更加困難了。（斯德哥爾慶廿八日特電。譯自一月三十日每日新聞）</p>

<h3>華北政會委員長　王蔭泰就職　發表施政方針三點</h3>
<p>北京十五日中社電　華北政務委員會新任委員長王蔭泰氏，特於十五日上午十一時在華北政務委員會外交大樓會議室舉行就職典禮，嗣並發表施政方針如次：　基於國家至上勝利第一之原則，上下一致向建設新國家途徑邁進。　强化官民提携之政治體制，努力保國安民，以促進生產。　强行實施健全政治。</p>
<h3>美積極侵蝕　渝軍事主權</h3>
<p>廣西前綫基地十六日中央社電　美軍對重慶軍事與主權之侵蝕，自湘桂作戰以來愈益露骨。據最近情報稱：美軍刻決定於新設之西南陸空軍總司令部內設置美人官佐總通絡官一名。同時並於緬甸遠征軍第四戰區點桂湘邊區新設總司令湯恩伯，及　越邊區新設總司令盧漢，各司令部及其管下各級司令部，亦同樣配置美人連絡官若干名。此種連絡官之任務，於駐屯時爲敎官，於刷新時從事連絡任務，面重慶方面亦於美軍後方司令部及美空軍司令部派連絡官一名，其業務僅於軍中財務處理。按過去雖亦有美人官佐担任對重慶軍作戰之指導，但從無如此大規模之配置，此雖可稱之爲運絡及敎育指導，互相交換派遺連絡員，實際上乃係美軍侵蝕重慶軍自主權之積極化，皆出於美軍片面之策動。據前次湘桂作戰時被俘之某參謀稱：蔣介石對美軍之侵蝕重慶軍自主權頗具戒心云。</p>

<h3>郭培爾勉德人　爲生存奮鬥　人民襲繫隊踴躍出征</h3>
<p>柏林十六日中央社電　德國社訊：郭培爾傳士在德國週刋發表「吾人之機會」一文，謂「最慘之戰爭，亦較勝於敵人迫使吾人接受之和平，且亦蚊易忍受。戰局之發表仍未確定，須待交戰國之一方放下武器始能確定，至於何方放下武器，則全在乎吾人。敵人今日確擁有較大之作戰潛力，但僅係物質的面非精神的，敵人並無値得奮戰値得效死之作戰目標，而吾人則有之，吾人乃爲保衛生存之權利而戰，决心爲保衛生存而戰之國家，决不能被征服，此即爲吾人獲取勝利之顯著機會。吾人之唯一救星即爲勇敢，勇敢不僅將獲得光榮，且將獲得勝利」。</p>
<p>柏林十六日中央社電　記者昨夜路過奧林匹克競賽塲，見該處集有人甚多，但非運動選手，乃人民襲繫隊也，因黑暗中無從探知，不久奧林匹克鐘樓「和平之鐘」響罷，即見分成數隊之人民襲繫隊，自競賽塲後方踴躍向前綫出發，歡送之聲不亞於一九三六年美法芬及其他世界各國之運動選手入塲之時，昨得見人民襲繫隊之特別隊，乘大型軍用汽車由競賽塲出發，並見人民襲繫隊之攻戰車隊，多携有攻戰車砲，一崗雙責前綫已迫柏林附近，故歡送時已無軍樂隊吹奏，柏林之防衛日漸繫張，市街道路已構築防禦工事。</p>

<p>東京十五日中央社電　據此間「每日新聞」瑞典京城專電：瑞典達開布押迭特報柏林特派員十日撰述「戰雲　戰勃蘭登堡」一文，就日覩之柏林東面戰况，報吿如次吾等獲德軍當局特別之許可，乘汽車抵達距柏林僅十公里之前綫，目親及耳聞之印象，至爲深刻。堅守重要戰略地點橋樑及汽車公路之德軍將校，揭掛赤色信號，命吾等停駛，吾等出示通行證，得其許可，安然前進，沿途見德軍正從事攔戰壕架電綫，設置司令部各項工作，爲阻止蘇軍之攻繫，大部份工兵竭力敷設地雷，公路行駛各式各樣之軍用車，泰半爲大型載重汽車，蜿蜒如長蛇，滿載者徐徐東來，空箱者急急西駛，往返運輸，絡繹不色。手握軍鍫之兵士，埋首建築陣地及堡壘，大批赤軍俘虜，向西整排行列，由舊俘虜收容所移往新地，彼等心境似極舒暢，毫無遲疑不安之象。記者等行至距鐵塲不遠之鎭內，天已大亮，該鎭德國市民尙未撤退，難民以家族爲單位，一批一批通過，以馬車輸送，車上滿嚴飼料等，車側貼有住所姓名，頗可據此推知蘇軍已至何處。彼等雖來途遙遠，然不平者毫無一人。當談及幫鄕足以留蘇之農園時，彼等緘口無言，更不悲泣，僅流露出無家可歸之表情，不亞過去遭受敵機盲炸之境况。某年輕少女，在馬車前進時，毅然道出「遲早必可重返故園」一語。靠近該路一湖傍之小院內，坐有年輕兵士四名，暢談時局，記者爲探聽彼等之討論，亦參加閒談，不加竟見，於彼等會話之口調中，足可代表總意志國民之思想，彼等一致意謂吾等決不放棄戰爭，更無降伏之舉，戰爭縱如何延長，亦決不畏　，敵軍縱以任何方漢攻繫，德國國民決不能步人自殺途徑。其中一人謂假設柏林陷落，吾等尙在柏林背後綱續作戰，吾人唯一之口號，即爲無條件抗戰。</p>
<h3>西綫戰局　無甚變化</h3>
<p>柏林十六日中央社電　海通社自負責方面探悉：西綫戰事前日復極遲鈍，反軸心軍因前數日連受損失，故其進攻力已減退。戰事重心在繆斯與瓦爾之間與沙爾一帶，浦書姆區戰事大見減弱，亞爾薩斯方面亦僅有局部戰事。英加軍在艾默里契與根奈浦之間重施進攻，加軍沿自克萊蕪通至文默里契·戈契·加爾加之公路進攻，英軍則欲在萊伊希華爾特森林與靈斯之間推進，但並無進展。萊伊希華爾特森林東邊與南邊，英軍坦克車先鋒隊所突入之缺口，即被德軍反攻收復，英軍企圖擴大尼爾河之橋頭堡，結果遭受重創而未逞。德軍在羅爾前綫採取放水揩施後，反軸心軍無甚活動，反軸心軍現在該處整理部隊，德砲則向之集中轟繫。美軍在沙爾前綫企圖擴大橋頭堡，亦遭受重創而未逞。德電在浦　姆城羅續從事防繫戰，迎繫重復突入城區之美軍，反軸心軍在艾契特那契畢特堡公路獲進展數百公尺，美軍在下亞爾薩斯進攻哈根那與沃柏　芬兵力甚微，即彼德軍砲火繫潰。</p>
<h3>西里西亞蘇軍　採大包圍戰略　戰事擴至奎斯河區域</h3>
<p>西里西亞前綫十六日中央社電　海通社訊：下西里西亞戰事益趨激烈，蘇軍似有大包圍之企圖，由缺口深入，占領城鎭及據點，組成包圍袋，德軍採取彈性戰術，及時撤退，並重創蘇軍。蘇軍似不惜犧牲，在奎斯Queis區域及布萊斯勞—柏林公路附近進攻，蘇軍先鋒已在紐海瑪及索曼杜夫渡河，斯普羅陶區域亦在劇戰中。薩根仍在德軍手中，薩根以北蘇軍渡波勃河，猛攻松茂斐爾特，蘇軍三路攻入紐薩爾茲，旋被繫退，坦克車損失一半。</p>
<p>柏林十六日中央社電　據前線消息：德軍戰車部隊於薩根地區，曾攻繫哥尼夫軍之側面，又隨機械化部隊企圖向西方進出之蘇軍有力戰率先鋒隊，於索洛地區大部被殲滅。然於西里西亞部之哥尼夫軍，更向北方格備堡進出，以至與蘇柯夫軍之左翼取得連絡，此外於沃特河中流之蘇軍擴大旣得渡河點及新渡河均未成功。自全般之見地觀之，自格倫堡北方至庫斯特林全綫，目下已入於作戰準備階段。</p>
<h3>雅爾及會議　各方面反響</h3>
<p>柏林十六日中央電　據德國政治報吿稱：雅爾太會議之公報發表後，自英美之評論觀之，知英美亦已承認斯達林爲此次會議中之唯一勝利者。美人以公報未曾提及太平洋戰爭，未免感覺失望，特戈爾服因公報中有允許法國參加掃行雅爾太會議決議之規定，竟至受寵若驚，一方面則以受旣成事實之　絆，未免心神難定。波關逃亡政府爲反對最烈之國，面另一犧牲者南斯拉夫竟表示願接受犧甡。以言德國，則耶爾太會議可以證明羅斯福邱吉爾之不敵斯達林，而反軸心國所劍導之新世界亦未見較舊世界爲佳，如果雅爾太之決議付諸施行，則英美兩國之社會制度生活方式，決不能用於歐洲大陸，而盆窮之歐洲亦決非世界和平之保障。</p>
<p>波蘭問題</p>
<p>瑞典京城十六日中央社電　據倫敦來電稱：蘭於克里米亞會談之內幕，嗣後判明羅斯福總統對寇松線劃定蘇波國境線問題，主張最少須將稄堡編入波蘭之新領土內，而斯達林議長則始終堅持應爲蘇聯所有。據發表稱，會談結果預料於寇松線之南部，至少或可有對於波蘭有利之解決，關於積堡因斯達林議長之堅持，已決定劃歸蘇聯。</p>
<p>瑞典就城十六日中央社電　據倫敦電：波蘭流亡總理十五日會見記者團，就克里米亞會談公報表明見解姐次：克里米亞會談之決定，實予波蘭主權一大打繫，波蘭國民對同盟國之重新分割波工蘭領土，及使其奴隸化之舉，確信僑居倫敦之波人，無一人願與盧布林政楹合流。斯達林議長口唱民主主義，實際波蘭人絕不信任蘇聯，蘇聯只有掠奪波蘭而陷入於飢餓。</p>
<h3>美國計劃參加　開發東部蘇聯</h3>
<p>瑞典京城十六日中央社電　德國社訊，斯文斯加報駐倫敦記者稱：華盛頓之有資格方面現方討論美國參加西伯利亞·東俄羅斯·及中亞細亞等地經濟開發之計劃，美國將不僅供給機械，且將購買其物品，蘇聯政府現在與美國行商進行談判，定購値數萬萬元之重工業機械及其他工業設備，某美國造船廠曾與蘇聯討論建造商船一隊，其他美商亦期望承避寒屋。美國方面得悉蘇聯竟欲開發東俄羅斯及西伯利亞，由馬拉爾山直至太平洋，在戰爭期內蘇聯之重之重工業已移至東方，面西伯利亞亦由蘇聯西部逃來之蘇人移殖，此種發展，在戰後亦將繼續。</p>
<h3>英下院辯論　大西洋憲章</h3>
<p>瑞典京城十六日中央社電　海通社訊：英下院昨夜討論大西洋憲章問題，保守黨議員威廉姆斯爵士詢問大西洋憲章是否適用於波羅的海各國，副首相阿特里拒不答覆。工重議吊索索倫森詢問何以大西洋憲章簽字時，未有不適用於某某國家之解釋，阿答里稱，大西洋憲章不能適用於反軸心國之敵人。</p>
<h3>美國陸戰隊眞相</h3>
<p>— 子明</p>
<p>西南太平洋方面，在美國總反攻的呼聲下，戰况愈形慘烈，他們憑恃其龐大的物量，企圖一島又一島的推進丕沉航空母艦，不惜犧牲，焦急產實行上陸戰。在其上陸作戰中，打商陣的就是海軍陸戰隊。以瓜達爾卡拿爾，新喬治亞，布根維爾島上陸作於爲始，以至蒙受空前大損失的　金，泰拉瓦兩島上陸作戰，及最近的雷伊泰，明多羅，呂宋等島上陸作戰，美國海軍陸戰隊總是上陸的先鋒。成爲美帝國主義犧牲品的這種陸戰隊，究竟是怎樣的呢？茲在下面略作叙述。</p>
<p>美國海軍陸戰隊創設及一七九八年七月一日。創辦者傳係「美國海軍之父」約翰·保羅·瓊斯。他在一七七九年獨立戰爭中，嘗垂彭胞姆·李郤特繫毀英艦賽爾必斯。自此以後，美國始有對抗英國的海軍。美國海軍陸職隊本部最初設於菲拉特爾費亞，一八〇〇年遷至華盛頓，以迄今日。</p>
<p>其後，美國陸戰隊曾先後參加一八一二年的英美戰爭及南北戰爭，在美亞戰爭中，爲獲得作爲美艦隊根據地的港灣，於古巴的岡泰拿莫灣登陸，爲海軍獲得了前進根據地，美國海軍由此痛感隨同艦　的軍隊之必要。第一次歐洲大戰時，除擔當確保兵站綫，守備港灣根據地等後方勤務以外，復從事超越陸戰隊本來任務的協同陸軍作戰，但頗能發揮其能力。又，在十九世紀後半及二十世紀中，由於西印象，中美各國及中國等經濟上政治上的不安，因有保護美國市民生命財產的必要，遂派遺陸戰隊至國外，於是海軍陸戰隊屢被當作美帝國主義政策的工具。</p>
<p>美陸戰隊的創設</p>
<p>如一八九五年對於古巴暴動的有組織援助，一八九三年夏威夷暴動之際陸戰隊的應援及其後的合併夏威夷，以及二十世紀初期對於尼加拉瓜的干涉等，即爲很好的實例。</p>
<p>美國的海軍陸戰隊，扼要說，乃是爲侵略主義之故而設立的。美國毫無受別國侵略的威脅，但自美亞戰爭以後，美國曾從事多次的弱肉强食戰爭。而每天次爲其　鋒的，就是海軍陸戰隊。至於編練這種旣非海軍又非陸軍的水陸兩用軍隊，即因上陸作戰時，陸軍部隊旣不慣於上陸作業，而在運輸中且有暈船的可能，以致不能在上陸之後即作劇烈的戰鬥。在這樣的時候，由慣於海洋生活的部隊來担當陸軍的任務，的確比較適宜得多。海軍陸戰隊就是根據如此的觀點而創設的。並且，從作戰指揮之點而言，艦隊換言之即海軍擁有這種直屬的陸上作戰部隊，可說是極有用塲的。</p>
<p>美國海軍陸戰隊的中樞機關規定：「陸戰隊爲海軍一單位，自須遵守海軍法律及條例，唯陸戰隊本部與海軍部其他各局有異，並非海軍部構成分子，係適合海軍狀况之一種陸軍組織，隸屬代行大總統權限之海軍部長。」並定其司令名號爲Major　General　Gommandant，設本部於華盛頓，至於該隊的一般能率與軍規風紀，則對海軍部長負責。</p>
<p>又，陸戰隊司令任期爲四年，由大總統任命。現在的美國陸戰統任命。現在的美國陸戰隊司令爲前年八月以來所羅門方面瓜達爾卡拿爾島上陸作戰，去年六月新喬治亞島上陸作戰及布根維爾島上陸作戰中担任指揮的房達古里夫特中將。由此點推察起來，美國爲有利展開今後的太平洋反攻作戰，將大大活用他在所羅門方面的作戰經騐吧。</p>
<p>吉官補充困難</p>
<p>陸戰隊的兵員數，已根據一九三八年六月二十三日的進級條例而法制化。平時，陸戰隊的下士官兵員數，規定佔正規海軍兵力二〇％，士官員數佔陸戰隊下士官法定員數五·五％，迨第二次歐洲大戰勃發，遂將平時法定員數士官一五二一名，兵員二七四九七名，緊急時三九四〇〇名，增中爲士官二五五二名，兵員四六四〇〇名，緊急時六〇〇〇名，及至大東亞戰爭勃發，再事增加，據美國海軍部長發表，一九四二年二月總兵力達一〇萬人，預定於一九四二年倍增爲二〇萬人，同年未爲四四萬人。</p>
<p>戰隊士官，　　　爲海這軍官學校畢業者及有功績的陸戰隊准士官，或由民間簡拔，資質較佳。但在第二次歐洲大戰爆發以後，因陸戰隊人員的急速擴充，士官的充實殊感困難。</p>
<p>美國陸戰隊兵員，自大東亞戰爭初起，於珍珠海一役敗戰以來，即在「毋忘珍珠灣」的標語下，大事募兵宣傳，且錄用黑人投効者，故至一九四二年十月二日總兵力已達二〇萬人。但其後因擴充軍備，國防產業需人孔殷，而陸軍又實施微兵法，所以當局雖然竭力宣傳，人員的大量募集仍感不易，此事徵諸一九四三年一月十二日美國戰時人力資源委員會聲明海軍亦得適用徵兵法，即可明瞭。</p>
<p>陸戰隊就其所負任務的性質，分爲艦隊陸戰隊，艦艇搭戰部隊及防備部隊三種。其中，艦隊陸戰隊爲遠征部隊，担任占領或防禦空軍或海軍的前進根據地。其開戰時的編制，除克華契可的第一陸戰師團及聖第埃哥的第二陸戰師團外，另有七個防備大隊及兩個航空隊。第一陸戰師團屬大西洋艦隊，第二陸戰師團附屬大西洋艦隊，第二陸戰師團附屬大平洋艦隊。一九四一年九月，活用第二次歐洲大戰的敎訓，爲期海空軍的堅密一體化，創設陸師團，航空隊及陸軍混成的水陸兩用部隊。</p>
<p>登陸用的武器</p>
<p>創設當時的太平洋水陸兩用部隊，司令官爲房達古里夫特中將的前任者西·皮·福蓋爾少將，設司令部於聖第埃哥，由第二陸戰師團，第二陸戰飛行團及陵轂第三師團編成，隷屬太平洋艦隊司令麾下，而其運輸與護衛，亦由太平洋艦隊担任，並包含高速運輸船隊。大西洋水陸兩用部隊的編制，與此相似，指揮係史密斯少將，司令部在克華契可。</p>
<p>茲就此等水陸兩用部隊所用水陸兩用戰車及舟艇，略加敍述。美國的水陸兩用戰車，有希·齊普（小型，載八人），鮑魚（大型，乘六〇人）及鴨型（大型，乘五〇人）等均備七·七糎機槍及一二·七糎機槍，且有裝備口徑更大的機關槍者。</p>
<p>至於上陸用舟艇，有用型舟艇（搭載武裝人員八名至一〇名，速力一四至一五浬），甲型三六呎舟艇（搭載武裝人員四〇名，速力一二浬）乙型四〇呎舟艇（搭載武裝人員五〇名，速力八至一〇浬），乙型七五呎舟艇（搭載武裝人員七五名，速力八至一〇浬）及戰爭搬運船，大砲搬運船等。</p>
<p>以外，此等水陸兩用部隊還有降落傘部隊，阻塞氣球中隊，滑翔機部隊等利用機動力急裝敵方要地，殺傷敵兵，退速而徹底破壞各項設施的廳襲部隊。</p>
<p>其次是　上搭　部隊，此係搭乘於戰艦（七五至八五名）天巡洋艦（五五至六五名）上者，爲艦上衛珍，戰鬥時兼爲舷側五時砲手。</p>
<p>至於防備部隊，則係擔任防衛海軍艦隊及航空根據地者。開戰以來，海軍要根據地的價値增大，並致全力使其近代化，機械化國。包含於備部隊的根據地防禦高射大隊編制，爲：三吋高射砲中隊三中隊（一二門），一二·七糎高射機關槍中隊一中隊（四八架），探照燈及聽音器中隊一中隊（探照燈聽音器各六座）。</p>
<p>美陸戰隊戰法</p>
<p>如上所述，陸戰隊的戰塲旣爲水陸兩戰塲，所以不獨知道各種上陸用舟艇的操作術，並且在登岸以後，牟做步兵，砲兵的工作，携帶機關槍，火焰放射器，戰車和大砲等武器。其中如大砲一項，凡陸軍所有者，陸戰隊亦均有之。他們有各種近氏科學兵器，飛機當然也是陸戰隊所有的，蓋在上陸之際。他們不僅出動所屬的飛機，並使用航空母艦所載的飛機，在空中　　下實行作戰。美國陸戰隊並有跳傘訓練，唯未實行大規模的作戰，僅在新幾內嚴及郤伊塞爾島用過少數降落傘部隊。</p>
<p>他們常立於侵略的尖端，久受水陸雙方的嚴格訓練，其質地與坡術確比陸兵水兵優秀。但他們在爪達爾卡拿爾上附以來，已砲　日軍打繫，知道用對等的兵力到底不能對仗，所以常用數倍至十餘倍的兵力來攻。</p>
<p>至其作戰方式，自從新喬治亞島以來，着重徹底砲繫，甚至將陸上業林完全轟毀，再不然就在沒有日軍的海岸上陸，迅連建築飛行塲，以期取得制空權，至如瑪金，泰拉瓦等不宜築機塲的島嶼，則在投下大影綱鐵之後，實行上附。</p>
<p>他們在登陸之際，有周到的準備與訓練，例如在阿慈島上附的附戰隊，曾受上島戰的訓練，在南方各島登附的附戰隊，則在澳洲業林戰的特殊訓練。</p>
<p>可是，是問這支爲侵略主義之爪的陸戰有如何的訓練，裝備，兵力，精銳無匹的日軍都將徹底打繫之。</p>

<h3>讀者助學消息　商店學校化　義賣市場巡禮</h3>
<p>「救濟失學義賣市塲」的紅橫額，臨風飄展着，距開市還有三刻鐘，興商采烈的觀衆們，已在發動攻勢。門警雖頭强抵抗，但終於屈服。湧，湧得連沿樓（）的別緻廣告也不及欣賞，好容易升上二樓。多炫目的的觀園！多熙攘的城廟！左首書畫廳已一業而爲商塲，交大半壁是兵工廠，程製而成的各式滯翔機，飛行機，軍艦等羅列着，不失機械工程第一的作風。聶中丞規模雖小，店員們的吶喊却大爲生色。滬江的熱忱。早已名聞遐邇，這次除大量義賣ABC糖果和CPC咖啡外，自製墨水，花生糖等。前日他們所主持的和昨日約翰接辦的食堂，可算全市塲最動人的貢獻，每天營業廿餘萬，中午起即吿客滿。漂亮的女生們，活潑地忙着親目下廚和招待。廿幾種中西美點大被誇贊，錦上添花的樂隊陪奏，更令人陶醉。二層上樓處貼着「快！上去看癆蟲打架！」原來三樓設着同德·約翰兩路室，各分標本，檢查·義賣三部。靑年醫師們娓娓講解着，和心肺檢查騐血等服務。再下二樓進圖書館改扮的商塲，滬江附中首相其衝，交易鼎盛，南模貨品精緻，尙有動物陳列。復旦滿貯得烟條，昨晨還在大禮堂舉行音樂會。明德擺設巧妙，大同主售食品，並以留聲機帮助攬客，啓秀自製糕餅多種。禮堂前午上演木偶戲，兩劇含義（）永，引人入勝。前晚表演話劇。啞劇效果優良，昨午更獻演滑稽戲。底層健身房轉變成質大的市塲，放送着興奮的鬧聲。在「天行健君子自强不息」的黑大字下，各商店展開着大競賣。福　和女靑的聯合商店，上工商店買賣忙碌，據云該兩店輕過少數同學的苦鬥，方才成立。育羣，華聯等囤有多量隨身用品，坤範捐得防空用器數十種，正養的貨物總値約兩百萬，媲美梵皇渡，滬江該是廿二隊四出捐募的成果，第一女中獨樹一職，出品可口點心，南屏貯備各式化妝品，滬光響應一人一物運動，學生慨捐物品數百件，大要自製咖啡糖，顧客爭購，華東低價多銷，備中南貨，培成，道中，民立等女校，佈置於步步高升的看台，貨品雖少，因招攬不遺餘力，早已售罄。滬新洽商兩廠，無限止供給金筆，魚油，祇收成本。梵皇渡旣獲銷票冠軍，商店規模亦大，物品列成長行，買客奔趨而至，並義賣顏惠慶氏等珍貴書畫。一圈走遍，老老少少的顧客們，仍是捨不得離開。他們徘徊着，觀賞着，灒美着，爭購着，學生店員似乎都畢業於商業專院，在不辭厭煩地進行持久戰後，終於獲勝。（約大澤萍）</p>

<h3>疏散人口的　幾個實際辦法</h3>
<p>— 育德</p>
<p>疏散人口的必要，各方討論的很多，已經從理論的階段進至實施的階段了。然而疏散一百萬人口到別處去，不是件輕而易舉的事，旣非空洞的勸吿所可奏效，悖逆昌把一百萬人送出市境便算了事。事先必須有周密妥善的計劃，處置尤貴迅速切實的行動，事後也當爲被收散的市民，設身處地想個謀生的久長辦法。筆者茲就管見所及，提出數點，貢獻給主持疏散工作者參考。</p>
<p>首先要解决的是交通問題，目前固然可以利用鐵道和水路，可是僅僅依靠鐵道和有限的船隻，在短期中疏散一百萬人口幾乎是不可能的。就算每天多開一列火車，便能收散三千人，一個月也不過十萬，實在不足以應付實的需要，適應當前緊急的局面。所以如以一個月爲鄭備登記的時期，一個月爲疏散第一個一百萬人口的時期，那麼不僅要靠鐵道和水路，還應當採取步行的方式。</p>
<p>關於步行疏散，近十年來在各地不乏先例，於此不必多說。如採用這辦法，應當：</p>
<p>（一）解决沿途保護問題，應由本市保安司令部組成特別的護送隊，隸屬於疏散委員會下之謹送股，保護幾條指定疏散路綫的安全。</p>
<p>（二）征用全市的搨處車甚至人力車，信照內地的驆運制度，逐段組成運輸站，隸屬於疏散委會的運輸股，搬運疏散市民的行李。</p>
<p>關於這點有比較詳細說明的必要。如以每天步行的速度爲四十華里，那末應將疏散綫每四十華里分爲一段，起訖兩點各設一運輸站，每段派給若干干輛塌車·老虎車·或其他車輛。需要車輛運輸行李的，祗需向運輸站申請繳費，由運輸站按照行李的重量大小，一次收足費用，然後指派輪到的車輛搬運，由起點運輸六發給憑單兩張，一交托運者，一交搬運者，至終點時同時交給終點的運輸站，托運者憑單取物，搬運者憑單取款，庶幾無留難勒索的困難，討價還價的繁瑣。第二天即由第二個第三個運輸段負責，一直送到指定疏散目的地。</p>
<p>爲什麼要每天換車？因爲假定每段指派五百輛車了，那末該段的運輸站必須對這五百輛車子施以業格管理，詳爲登記並取得擔保（或聯保），以免中途偸竊或逃走。運輸站必須對托運者絕對負責。</p>
<p>至於塌虎車或其他車輛之征用，不是全無代價的，一面規定比較公道的搬運費，一面於回程時，應當規定可以合法的販運若干米柴等日用品，供給都市需要，不但載運多少，應當規定，連價格也應規定，以便此一段的搬運夫轉賣給下一段的搬運夫。所得的利潤，作爲搬運者協助疏散的報酬。</p>
<p>（三）疏散的目的地應當指定幾個在軍事上比較無價値的城市，當地的縣政府必須也參加疏散委員會，縣政府應當立即調查當地的房屋，規定每人僅可佔住若干方尺的房屋，超過這數目的，便應該出租，凡是自認爲已無空屋出租的應由保甲方面證明，由縣府發給證明書短途游黏貼門外，無證明書的房屋如拒絕出租，可以呈請政府强制執行，只有如此才能解决收散市民的居住問題。</p>
<p>（四）市民疏散時，政府應規定准許携帶一定數額以下的某幾種貨物，譬如每人可帶五萬元以下的香烟火柴等工業製品之類，大約五口之家能有二十萬左右的貨物帶到內地，便可下愁生產無術，坐吃山空了。在都市存積多量的工業製品，充其量祗能充作囤積的籌碼，同時也違反戰時物資分散的原則，如果運往農村，反有助於金融的流通，可使因爲收買糧食大量流入農村中的現鈔，逐漸回籠。</p>
<p>（五）對於限制人口再自內地回入上海，政府應不憎繁瑣地訂出一個詳細的辦法。我認爲凡回鄕的即應收回居住證，無上海市居住證的不准通過封檢所，鐵路水道的交通機關應當憑上海居住證發售來（）車票（有公務員身份證者除外），這個辦法在有些都市已經實施過，對物資的流動等等，並沒有發生什麼不良影響。（有特別事故自可向上海市府請領「回遷證」）</p>
<p>總之，疏散人口是件複雜繁難的工作，不但事行要詳細規定辦法，要廣爲宣傳指導，執行的時候也應隨時隨地修正。只有這樣才能減少疏散市民的痛苦，（）疏散工作順利進行。</p>

<p>輔導組</p>
<p>說明</p>
<p>秘書處：市府秘書處是市府的神經中樞，凡市府對各局處的重要指示，全由秘書處發令，而各附屬機關日常工作的考核，也由秘書處各組織管。秘書處由市長秘書長直接指揮，不另設處長，各組（不久將改科）設正副組長各一人，助理員十餘人左右。總務·文書·人事三個科各設科長帮辦各一人，科員辦事員若干人。硏究編譯兩室每室設主任一人，助理員若干人。拔正專員咨議都是辦理特交的事項，譬如調查事件，審查工程，硏究敎育，審議未予規等工作。</p>
<p>警察局：警察局範圍之大，甲於市府所屬各局處。一則因爲市區太大，警察局是由前兩租界巡捕房和舊市區察局合併而成，二則現在國府施政綱領確冷冰冰臺安列爲首要，所以警力不能不使其充分。上海警察局異於各地的特色，是中外籍警員會同負責執行勤務，現在警員中除中國外，有日本·法國·俄國·印度等國籍人員，都能發揮所長，互相合作，共同維持大上海的治安。</p>
<p>財政局：本文所列財政局組織系統表，是最近的情形。在實行機構簡素化的原則下，把消費特稅處，總會計處，市金庫三個獨立機關合併吸收，改設爲科，以收辦事迅速，費用節省之功效。財政有了辦法，市政纔能推進，所以財政局對市政是最有貢獻了。</p>
<p>經濟局：經濟局是大東亞戰爭爆發後的產物，而其戰責之看大，在市府各局處中僅次於警察局。不過上海情形特殊，譬如米輒油權煤靑菜水果等等市民日用品，各有專設統制機關，經濟局不能直接管理；但是道許多商品價格的波動，可以影響到一般物價，所以現在上海的經濟局處理事務是相當困難的。</p>
<p>公用局：公用局對於市民發生密切關係的部分，本來是水電電重煤氣等，但是現在市民對公用局的接觸，大都祗限於陸上交通車輛登記與車輛管理一部。事實上公用局也就是第三科工作最繁重，關於其他公用事業的管理，都放在次要地位。</p>
<p>工務局：工務局各科除總務科外，大都是按術方面工作，每科設正副科長。科下還設各股，技術方面，仍有外籍人員服務。</p>
<p>敎育局：敎充局的機構，職掌分明，（）庸解釋。惟有筆六科（）（）（）（）一八區市立學校事務，是因爲舊一八區市立學校的組織制度，全與其他公私立學校不同之故。將來逐漸改變，可期統一。</p>
<p>衛生局：衛生局的工作，也多含校衛生。過去在工部局時代的病理檢查，化學分析兩部分工作是最膾（）人口的。目前各科的工作，以第三科環塲衛生及第七科淸除垃圾（）俾最重要，環境衛生，豐如市面上一切不淸潔的飲食品之取稀，傳染病之預防，都是戰時所必不能忽略的。尤其是第七科淸除垃圾舊便。最近市街上的垃圾堆集，有碍市容，所以該局今後的工作，也是十分艱巨的。</p>
<p>地政局：地政局在市府各局中，與市民接觸最少，其性質又最專門，那些名詞，聽起來令人無法了解。然而此一部門亦不能缺，否則土地的問題不能解决，一切市政從何辦起？</p>
<h3>娛樂塲所　優待軍警問題</h3>
<p>— 馮舒人</p>
<p>年來各娛樂塲所爲了不知優待軍警及公務人員，以致時常發生誤會，筆者以爲上術現象，是地方治安的重大阻礙。用敢以娛樂事業從業員劍及履及的經驗，貢獻幾點。</p>
<p>（一）規定半價優待：這是各國通行的辦法，不論何種娛樂塲所，其座券聽另設一種軍警優待半價劵，凡屬軍警及公務人員，概限本人，並須服裝整齊，能提出證明文件爲享受半價優待的必要條件。</p>
<p>（二）定期公演免費招待：除娛樂塲所日常營業公演時間外，特定某一日或某一塲，專門招待軍警及各機關公務人員，一律免費。當由軍憲或主管機關，指派專員蒞塲負責照料。如當地有一家以上之娛樂塲所者，不妨分期輪値表演。</p>
<p>（三）特設軍警優待座：先田軍警及各機關，合組一軍警娛樂指導管理委員會，負責辦理。按照各娛樂塲所之容座額，及其演藝性質，所在地區，分別指定特設重警優待座之多少，逐日按額核發參觀劵。凡屬軍警及公務員，均須充先領參觀券，然後持向各指定娛樂塲所掉換座券，換券時尤須注意檢查證件，仍以穿着制服，佩帶證章者爲限，以防冒充轉售等流弊。</p>
<p>（四）敎育性娛樂之特別演出：値茲非常時期，僞酬尉軍警及公統一領導人員辛勞，不妨選擇有益敎育，怡情悅性之娛樂，在各該機關內，或公共會塲訂期演奏，如下劇·話劇·電影等均可。</p>
<p>以上所擬，擇一而行，即可避免許多糾紛，對社會秩序之安寗，必大有補益，於娛樂事業之前途關係尤非淺鮮也。</p>
<h3>物價問題座談會（二）　前文見二月　十日第四版</h3>
<p>本報陳社長　船津先生不但是日本在華經濟界的權威，對於上海的經濟現象，尤有深切研究，對此想來必具卓見。</p>
<p>船津辰一郞　第一問題爲物價評定標準是，據本人所知：去年一月十三日實業部公佈之「戰時物價管理暫行條例」第五條：規定價格評定標準，爲除去運費，事務費及一切捐稅後，再加利潤，其利潤批發價最高不超過百分之十，零售價最高不起過百分之二十計算之。</p>
<p>在前局長時代，生產費之計算按照下數項決定之：（一）原料（二）工資（三）電力（動力）（四）運輸費（五）利息（六）生產設備消耗費（七）捐稅（八）營業費。</p>
<p>現在物價評議會之陳秘書，對物價依（一）農產品，（二）工業品，（三）原料品三類分別計算之。其計算票準如下：</p>
<p>（一）農產品：一，產地價格，二，運費，捐稅零售之規定利潤。</p>
<p>（二）工業品：一，原料價格，二，燃料或動力，三，直接生產費用，四，間接生產費用，五，利息及折舊，六，各種指數之變遷（如生活，批發，零售指數等），七，批發及零售利潤。</p>
<p>（三）原料：一，農產品依照第（一）項計算，二，舶來品則照存貨匯兌率，按黑市情形斟酌決定，三，統制品照收買價格及市塲情形斟酌計算，四，工業製品照第（二）項計算。</p>
<p>以上三項，共價格由同業公會申請之。</p>
<p>第二問題爲黑市處置辦法，（一）應與調查及情報綱之組織連絡，（二）規定勵行物資之登記及移動手續，（三）指定交易辦法，—在周家橋及其他地點設立米之默認市塲。</p>
<p>第三問題爲管理物資方法，特別應重視取締業外人之囤積：（一）澈查銀行錢莊之放款，（二）秘密調查：（一）各大行號之進貨及銷貨情形，（二）銀行錢莊之收支情形，（三）存貨，（三）澈查行號之正式登記資本與實際運營資本，（四）對倉庫作不定期之調查，（五）對於假冒公會會員之調查。</p>
<p>第四問題爲公會之整理，應當：（一）人事方面：調查假公會以濟私之理警事，排繫並整理之。（二）組織方面：（一）相似公會之合併（樹柴業公會有五個之多），（二）確立公會內部之保甲組織，必須細胞式的，使上下意見溝通，並澈底發揚守法精神。（三）對公會之監理官，嚴格選任，不再虛設名立，任用私人，（過去監理官實際並不每日到職），（四）目前不加入公會而營業者頗多，對於此事應加取締。（五）訓練會員——用開會方法使會員認識時局，發揚守法精神，擁護市府及與市府合作之精神。</p>
<p>本報陳社長　船津先生說得很週密詳盡。現在請康原先生表意見。</p>
<p>項康原　在戰時經濟各部門中，壓平物價一項，最難順利解决，蓋物資種類繁頣，而每的資中舉凡原料來源，運輸費用，動力供應等，都足以影響其成本而增高物品的售價，且各物間又相互牽連，很難局部予以解决。所以管理物價，欲期全艦壓平，不免事倍功半，吃力不討好。爲切合實際起見，不如採用重點制爲且，例如：選定幾種生活必需物品，如米柴菜蔬綢布食油肥皂火柴等，政府方面，須不顧一切艱困阻碍，用全力予以壓平，俾安定最低限度的民生。其餘物品。凡與民衆無切虜關係者，不妨任其自然漲落，不必做枉勞無功的工作。如果財力優裕的人，即以高價購些非必需品，亦屬滿不在乎，政府又何必力竭嚴嘶去管理一切次要物資，致弄得不好，反鬧成黑市低於限價（例如襯衫）的笑話呢？</p>
<p>依最近三年的情形觀察，一切物價的上漲，似乎都由米糧價格的上漲在領導着，所以米價如能盡力設法抑低，則其他物資的漲勢，也可稍殺。反之，如米價無法抑平，任其節節飛漲，則欲期其他物價之壓低，不啻緣木求魚。</p>
<p>目前欲抑平日用必需品的價格，（甲）消極方面：（一）必須用政治全力嚴禁產地及運輸途中的重重勒索。治亂世用重典正可實施於這種塲合。（二）財政上採用嚴格的收縮通貨及信用政策，以減少囤積力量。（乙）積極方面：（三）由政府協助各公團至產地收購大量物產來滬，沿途由軍警保護，廓除一切剝削，以充裕來源。（四）從速恢復各工廠的電力，因現今各廠因動力缺乏而生產停頓，不特物資供應減少，且仍攞有不少的職工，坐耗物資，不事生產，對於物品存量，不免發生變重的威脅，於是物價更漲無止境了。故恢復工廠電力，實爲物價政策中重要之項目，希望當局加以密切的注意。</p>

<h3>Local Japanese Air Defense Units Launch Interception Battles Against the Enemy; Iwo Jima Subjected to Enemy Naval Bombardment Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) – The Imperial Japanese Headquarters announced at 6:30 PM on the 16th: A powerful enemy mobile force appeared in the vicinity of Japan. From around 7:00 AM to approximately 4:00 PM on the 16th, they carried out wave after wave of attacks on Japanese airfields in the Kanto region and Shizuoka Prefecture using their main force of carrier-based aircraft. Japanese air defense units in various locations launched interception battles against this enemy and achieved considerable results. An enemy fleet consisting of over thirty warships, including battleships and aircraft carriers, has been conducting naval bombardments of Iwo Jima since the morning of the 16th.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) – The enemy American mobile force, which appeared near Taiwan and the Philippines at the end of January, reappeared near Japan on the 16th and launched its first large-scale bombing raid on the Japanese mainland using its carrier-based aircraft. Simultaneously, an enemy mobile force consisting of over thirty warships, including battleships and aircraft carriers, has been conducting naval bombardments of Iwo Jima, the forward defense of Japan's Pacific line, since the morning of the 16th. The enemy mobile force appearing near Japan is the main force of the enemy American naval power in the Pacific Ocean, centered around over ten aircraft carriers. The total number of enemy carrier-based aircraft attacking Japan is over one thousand. The enemy American use of such a large number of carrier-based aircraft to attack Japan, along with the naval bombardment of Iwo Jima, proves that the enemy intends to attempt a landing on Iwo Jima in the near future, which is not difficult to predict. The enemy mobile force continues to maneuver near Japan, and its carrier-based aircraft may attack the Japanese mainland again on the 17th. The enemy's attempt to seize the Iwo Jima area has two strategic implications: Iwo Jima is a base from which the Japanese military attacks enemy American bases in the Mariana Islands. When B-29s bomb the Japanese mainland, they are repeatedly and quickly detected by the Japanese military's surveillance network on Iwo Jima, resulting in significant losses, so there is a need to occupy it. If the enemy occupies Iwo Jima, it can be used as a base for fighter escorts for B-29s. When enemy carrier-based aircraft attacked the Japanese mainland on the 16th, one B-29 appeared several times before the large-scale air raid began. This time, carrier-based fighters were the main force, focusing their efforts on attacking Japanese air force bases, military facilities, and transportation lines, such as trains and ships. However, thanks to the perfect defense of the Japanese air force, the damage on all sides was minimal.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) – On the 15th, approximately sixty B-29 enemy aircraft came to bomb Nagoya, Shizuoka, and Mie prefectures. Japanese air defense units launched interception attacks. Investigation results showed that seventeen enemy aircraft were damaged, and one Japanese aircraft did not return.</p>
<h3>Philippine Operations: Enemy American Losses Heavy; Minister Matsushima Discusses the Pacific War Situation</h3>
<p>The Japan Naval Fleet Press Department stationed in China, as usual, met with news reporters from various newspapers in the city yesterday (the 16th) at 3:00 PM. Minister Matsushima personally presided over the meeting and elaborated on the valiant fighting of the Japanese army in Manila and the difficulties faced by the enemy Americans in Pacific operations. A summary of his remarks is as follows:</p>
<p>Enemy Troops in Luzon Suffer Heavy Losses</p>
<p>Minister Matsushima first discussed the Philippine war situation, stating: Fierce battles are taking place in Manila, the Sierra Madre Mountains, and Banban on Luzon Island, with the most intense fighting occurring within Manila city. The enemy's 37th Division's 1st Cavalry Regiment advanced into the city from the north, but this unit has not been able to establish contact with the 11th Airborne Division and other units. The Japanese army and naval landing forces are intercepting the enemy on the south bank of the Pasig River, causing them to bleed. Regarding this difficult battle, the enemy has stated three reasons why their operations are difficult to progress: Due to the accuracy of Japanese artillery fire, mines are buried everywhere in the city, and they must protect Americans and foreign nationals, which greatly hinders their operations. The Japanese army frequently crosses the Pasig River to charge enemy positions, destroying their defenses and causing them great damage and fear. The current battleground for the final struggle in the Manila area is the Pasig River and the coastal area. The strong resistance of the Japanese army is causing heavy losses to the enemy Americans. The enemy admits that the losses suffered in the Philippine operations are unprecedented. From this, it can be seen that the enemy American losses in manpower and material resources are truly incalculable.</p>
<p>Difficulties Abound in Mainland Operations</p>
<p>The enemy American fleet's base in the Pacific has now been moved from Nimiz to Guam, and this will be used as a base for naval operations from now on. A portion of the air force has already bombed Iwo Jima and the Ogasawara Islands. The enemy has repeatedly revealed that the battle for Luzon Island is particularly difficult and that it will take time. From this, it is known that mainland operations in China cannot be realized for the time being, because their material preparations cannot be completed hastily. According to the New York Times on February 13, Chiang Kai-shek has agreed with the United States to launch a large-scale counterattack against the Japanese army in the coastal areas of China in the near future, but due to the fierce operations of the Japanese army last year, this counterattack plan has clearly become a bubble. If the American army wants to operate on the Chinese mainland, it will give the millions of Japanese troops who have been waiting for a long time a good opportunity to annihilate the enemy. Enemy American mainland operations are a very risky move. It is expected that before launching this plan, the American army will first occupy some small islands in the Pacific as a prelude to publicizing mainland operations.</p>
<p>Japanese Naval and Air Forces Await Opportunities to Fight</p>
<p>The Japanese navy's operations, no matter where the enemy comes from, always have a consistent policy. The Japanese navy's elite fleets and air forces are all waiting for opportunities to get close to the enemy. A United Press dispatch from the New York Times on the 15th quoted Colonel Matsushima as saying that the Japanese naval fleet will never avoid a direct confrontation with the American army. The Japanese navy's operational policy can be known from this.</p>
<p>Regarding the European war situation, the Soviets have already crossed the Warta River and made some progress. However, the German army is still very vigorous, fighting bravely and persistently. At the end of the last tripartite meeting of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, plans to dispose of Germany were discussed. After this news was released, the German people showed no signs of wavering, because their determination to fight is truly unwavering.</p>
<p>Chinese and Japanese Cooperate to Defend Shanghai</p>
<p>Recently, due to the movement of some Japanese soldiers and their families in Shanghai, some people seem to have a sense of unease. In fact, Shanghai is determined to defend itself to the death through the cooperation of both Chinese and Japanese forces to enhance combat power. Citizens really don't need to feel uneasy. We observe that some ignorant people in Shanghai are dreaming of waiting for the Americans to return. These people have forgotten China's past glory and its indelible history. After the Philippine war, the American army has poisoned the Filipinos three times, resulting in tragedies. The people of Shanghai who are waiting for the American army to arrive can take this as a warning. Recently, Chinese newspapers have published articles promoting the spirit of national self-determination and revitalizing the country, which is very gratifying. China and Japan must cooperate and become one to defend against aggression and protect the country, so that the people can obtain stability in their lives. Japan is determined to do its best to achieve this. It is reported that Chiang Kai-shek is currently ill and resting. It is hoped that he will think more about the future of East Asia and the welfare of the people on his sickbed, and express his intentions three times for the complete cooperation between China and Japan in the future, in order to realize the rebirth of East Asia.</p>
<p>I saw the joyful state of the young Chinese men and women in the city during the Lunar New Year, which I had never seen in the past, and I felt happy in my heart. In the past three days, the supply of electric lights, trams, and movies has been extended, allowing everyone to enjoy themselves. If the American army invades, these facts will become a dream. The highest responsibility of the citizens of a country is to protect their country and maintain and promote the welfare of the people. It is a big mistake for the people of Shanghai to think that the American army can come in this peaceful state. It must be known that if the American army operates on the mainland, it will be the first to suffer. Shanghai is the heartland of the Chinese and Japanese people, and it is also the heartland of a group of people from Chongqing or Yan'an. Therefore, it cannot be regarded as just an economic city of China. In order to protect this heartland, the Chinese and Japanese sides must cooperate and not hesitate to sacrifice themselves.</p>
<h3>Japanese Literature Patriotic Association Decides on This Year's Plan</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Literature Patriotic Association recently convened the second executive committee of the Greater East Asia Writers' Conference. Attendees included Chairman Yoshio Yoshimine, Yoshio Toyoshima, Jun Takami, Fumaki Tsuchiya, and Secretary-General Nakamura. Regarding the association's foundation, the following plans were formally decided: In order to build Greater East Asian culture, respect the classics, and further publish Japanese and foreign language translations of the Greater East Asia Classical Series, which penetrate Eastern classics and strengthen the spirit of morality, a translation team will be established within the secretariat. In order to fully utilize drama, a Greater East Asia Dramatists' Conference will be held in the fall of this year. To promote Greater East Asian culture, poets and writers will be exchanged between countries. Taking Sino-Japanese-Manchu friendship as an appropriate method of cultural exchange, a cultural alliance will be organized with Chinese poetry as the center. A Greater East Asia Academy of Arts will be established as a lively and orderly promotion mechanism for establishing Greater East Asian culture.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Deliberation and Management of Prices</h3>
<p>The current price issue has undeniably transcended the economic sphere and become a major political difficulty. Although price fluctuations are inevitable during wartime, the lack of a proper regulated economy in our country has created an unprecedented surge in prices. This is of course due to other factors besides price management, but it is also undeniable that there has been no reasonable control over prices to date.</p>
<p>With this recent renewal of municipal personnel, the general public has high expectations for the stability of people's livelihoods in the rear during this crucial stage of the war. In order to achieve this goal, the economic authorities have not only reorganized the Price Deliberation Council, but have also revised its organizational regulations. This measure is indeed enough to refresh our minds. However, we believe that in this extraordinary period, in addition to considering market conditions and the cost of goods, the price assessment must also use the spirit of cutting through the chaos with a quick knife if it wants to clarify the current chaotic prices. Taking a certain major item as a benchmark, or taking the price on a certain day as a benchmark, as the basis for price limits, and stipulating that it will not be easily changed in the future. Otherwise, this deliberation and assessment may not be able to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past.</p>
<p>In this extraordinary period, any system or law that is not implemented vigorously and quickly will instead create a source of various malpractices. We cannot immediately say that there will be no oversights after the reforms. Therefore, in order to stabilize prices, it is necessary not only to assess their prices, but also to strictly manage them. In other words, any act of arbitrarily raising prices must be resolutely and severely punished. The market conditions of various goods in the city are mostly controlled by the various product markets. In the future, the economic security authorities must strive to rectify these sources of price increases. In particular, the organization and management of various industry associations should also be strengthened as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Price Deliberation Council held a joint meeting of councilors and expert committees to decide on the cost and selling price of sixteen types of goods, and will submit opinions today. The Deliberation Committee will then make a final decision. Before long, new price limits will be decided for major commodities, and there is considerable expectation for stabilizing prices. However, based on past experience, price deliberation is entirely a passive task. If strict supervision and enforcement cannot be found, then price assessment is just a formality. Therefore, in the past, there have been many complaints about the competent authorities. In the future, it is hoped that deliberation, execution, and supervision will become unified, and that deliberation will become a prerequisite for managing prices. In this way, the deliberation work can be made proactive, and the entire price can achieve stable results.</p>

<h3>Gleanings from Nanhui</h3>
<p>— Yifei</p>
<p>When this reporter left Nanhui two months ago, the county government was slightly using the people's land to build roads in order to develop transportation, prosper the market, and circulate materials between urban and rural areas. This measure is essential for the current environment and contributes greatly to wartime defense. From a broad perspective, although farmers will suffer some losses due to the slight separation of land, it is not too critical.</p>
<p>Road Construction</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, of the six major trunk lines planned in the past, which were vigorously promoted at the time with a deadline for completion, only a few sections have been completed to date: the Huangjia Road to Laogang section in the first district, the Jiangzhen to Lujia Road section in the second district, and the Dawei to Pengqi Temple section in the eighth district. The remaining lines, such as the Zhuhqiao to Zhoupu, Yuqiao to Tangqiao, and Beicai to Chuansha trunk lines, have all been suspended. The completed sections have not been used for traffic and have been left to naturally collapse. The reason for this is that the rivers and waterways in Nanhui are crisscrossed, requiring a large amount of bridge construction materials. In this extraordinary period of material conservation, there are difficulties, leading to the suspension of construction. It is deeply hoped that the county authorities will find a way to complete the entire project as soon as possible, so as to avoid wasting previous efforts.</p>
<p>In addition to the trucks of the Shanghai-Nanhui Long-Distance Bus Company on the Zhoupu to Dajuan section, only small cars of the East Asia Company operate on the current routes. The former only has one bus a day, and due to the small number of vehicles and frequent use, there are often breakdowns, which are not enough to meet the huge needs. The latter has expensive fares, which are staggering. From Dongchang Road to Zhoupu, it has reached two thousand gold, and from Dongchang Road directly to Dajuan, it costs ten thousand gold per person. At such fares, ordinary people cannot afford to inquire. It is deeply hoped that when all the roads are completed in the future, the authorities will be able to organize a sound transportation agency on their own, and the fares will be affordable to the public, so that farmers who are fulfilling their obligations can also enjoy a thing or two.</p>
<p>Cooperative Undertakings</p>
<p>The Nanhui Cooperative Branch is managed by the "Cooperative Undertakings Committee of the Executive Yuan" and is subject to the "Shanghai Regional Liaison Office" of the Committee. It was established on September 1, 1943. Currently, there are 41,430 members, and the society's funds are 4.2 million yuan. Members pay a fund of 60 yuan per household, and a deposit of 20 yuan. The first society was He Li Yijhen, who resigned immediately, and was succeeded by Wang Xiuxian, who had previously served as the district chief of the area. However, as things were just starting out, and because 90% of the members were farmers who lacked knowledge of cooperative undertakings and were mostly uninterested, most of them joined under the coercion of township leaders, and after the fact, they did not ask about the society's affairs. (One aspect is also due to intelligence.) Also, the villagers originally hoped that after joining, they could get cheap rationed goods, but in fact, it was difficult to fulfill their wishes, and the villagers felt disappointed. The society's own expenses were huge, and they did not know how to use the funds for production costs, resulting in a situation of sitting and eating empty mountains. When this reporter arrived in Nancheng in early October of last year, I went to the society to investigate and saw that the society's affairs were at a standstill and no one was in charge. Later, the local gentry Zhang Shihua took over, but due to the heavy difficulties, it was not easy to start, and he resigned after only a month or so.</p>
<p>It is learned that the society held a members' representative meeting on November 29 of last year, with a total of 36 representatives present, with only 8 absent. At that time, members were sent by various agencies to attend and supervise the reorganization. The local gentry Ye Bingwei was selected on the spot to serve as the chairman and president, and the branch was moved to Zhoupu Township. The society's "Nanhui City Township Branch Office" was established in Nanhui City. What this reporter hopes for today is:</p>
<p>Increase Capital</p>
<p>The society's original funds were almost exhausted when they were handed over, leaving only 500,000 gold, only 1/9 of the original amount. This meager amount is really difficult to do anything with. Farmers should be earnestly persuaded to introduce friends and relatives to join the society in order to increase its strength. At the same time, incentive measures should also be established for old members, and they should be encouraged to increase their original funds. Strive for Allocations Although the society's allocation has been more than half a year since it began, the actual allocation has only been five times, and the quantity is minimal, which is like a drop in the bucket and does not help. The number and quantity of allocations should be increased to encourage them. Run Agricultural Loans At present, the rural economy is exhausted, and the cooperative strives to handle agricultural loans, providing farmers with plows, cattle, seeds, etc. Other activities such as establishing experimental fields, running "mutual aid societies", and promoting group living, etc. If all these are held one by one, then the Nanhui Cooperative Undertaking, which was on the verge of dying in the past, will surely have a day of revival, and the future cannot be limited.</p>
<p>The Year's Scenery is Desolate</p>
<p>Today's rural merchants still take the end of the lunar year as the settlement period. In previous years, the town purchased New Year's goods, and the market was prosperous. This year, it is far less than in the past. In addition to the five ocean general merchandise stores being sparsely populated, the southern goods stores also have dwindling customers. From this, we can reflect the exhaustion of the rural economy and the thinness of the public's purchasing power.</p>
<p>Japanese Navy's "Moonlight" New Sharp Aircraft</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Implements "Charging" Warfare on Luzon Island; Enemy Heavily Damaged in Southern Manila</h3>
<p>Luzon Front Line, 15th (Central News Agency) – The enemy's overall force on the Luzon war front is focused on the capture of Manila. This was originally MacArthur's plan. Judging by the enemy's landing of weapons and ammunition in Lingayen and San Fabian, the center of the Manila battlefield is still the area on the south side of the Pasig River running through the city center and the old city area. These areas are still under the control of the Japanese army. The enemy troops invading the Katipunan area gradually increased their forces. On the 11th, they attacked with tanks and 30 infantrymen. One part of them went straight to the Kungjili area, and the other part attacked the Pigen area. At that time, the elite Japanese army and navy in the west of Majili and the Nicolas airfield immediately launched interception attacks. A part of the enemy troops invaded the Pa-on in the southern part of Manila late on the 11th and were heavily damaged by the Japanese army's commando attacks until the morning of the next day. Around 1:00 AM on the 12th, the enemy shelled Majili, and it did not stop until the 13th, but the Japanese army defending the area did not waver. Repeated bayonet battles were launched near Bangke, and fierce fighting was in full swing between the two sides. The enemy troops who invaded the vicinity of the Nicholas airfield were also attacked and repelled. The battles in the Clarkfield area were extremely fierce. Since the 9th, the enemy has first used artillery fire to cover, followed by dozens of tanks as the vanguard, and repeatedly attacked the Japanese army's central position. Therefore, the Japanese army's right wing retreated to the second line of defense, but the Japanese army in the center still firmly defended the first line of defense. The enemy troops in this area suffered heavy losses. The British 30th Division suffered heavy casualties due to the repeated fierce attacks of the Japanese army. Currently, there is no major change in the front of Lingayen. The enemy's naval bombardment is intermittent. Only the enemy troops near San Jose are relatively active. Taking advantage of the enemy's slow offensive, the Japanese army has been implementing charging tactics day and night. In terms of the battle results from the 8th to the 11th alone, more than 1,500 enemy soldiers have been killed or wounded. In addition, 4 enemy tanks, 8 artillery pieces, 30 mortars, a large number of machine guns, more than 30 trucks, 35 tents, and 11 military supply warehouses have been destroyed. At the same time, 10,000 rounds of various bullets, 10 mortars, 3 rapid-fire guns, 5 heavy machine guns, 25 light machine guns, automatic rifles, and telephones were intercepted.</p>
<h3>Central Senate of Java Increases Number of Senators</h3>
<p>Jakarta, 16th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese military administration will hold the first meeting of the Central Senate on the 20th of this month. Prior to the meeting, it was decided to increase the existing 26 senators (the original quota was 28, with two vacancies) by 20, and the appointments were officially announced on the 11th. This arrangement is different from the previous increases in that the new senators include all Arab, Minadoan, and Dutch mixed-race ethnic groups, with the intention of uniting Indonesia and striving for independence, so that the total strength of all ethnic groups can expand the scope of participation in government.</p>
<h3>Chongqing American Aircraft Attack Kyoto; Three Shot Down</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency) – Three Chongqing American Air Force P-51 aircraft invaded the capital's airspace at 1:53 PM on the 16th. They were fiercely shelled by the Allied air defense forces, and two were shot down. The location of the crash has not yet been determined. Another aircraft trying to escape was also shot down. There was no damage on our side.</p>
<h3>Hatta and Fujiwara Appointed as Cabinet Advisors; Japanese Information Bureau Officially Announces</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese government, due to the death of Cabinet Advisor General Nobumasa Suetsugu, has decided to appoint former Minister of Transport Yoshio Hatta and former Minister of Military Supplies Ginjiro Fujiwara as Cabinet Advisors to supplement the successors and enhance the Cabinet Advisor lineup. The appointments were presented to the Emperor on the 15th, and the news bureau officially announced them at 6:00 PM that afternoon. As a result, there are a total of fourteen Cabinet Advisors. Yoshio Hatta was also ordered to oversee administrative inspection matters. Ginjiro Fujiwara will also be in charge of matters related to steel production.</p>
<h3>Indian Delegation Arrives in England to Attend Imperial Conference</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 16th (Central News Agency) – The Reuters News Agency reports: A seven-member Indian delegation has arrived in London to attend the Imperial Conference to discuss matters related to India.</p>
<h3>Pacific War Front: Isolated Japanese Units Active, Tenaciously Holding Positions, Causing Deep Terror to American Forces</h3>
<p>Regarding the "clear and courageous fighting" of the Japanese garrison in Rabaul, the Japanese side has long announced it. Recently, a Swedish newspaper published a dispatch from a New York correspondent about the "isolated units" of the Japanese and German armies in the Pacific and European war zones. The article was almost entirely about the Japanese isolated forces in the Pacific. Excerpts are translated below:</p>
<p>Hindering American Forces: Whether in the Pacific or Europe, behind the anti-Axis battle lines, there are still Japanese or German troops in isolated and unsupported situations, securing important positions and adopting strong defensive postures. These troops show no signs of surrender. Although they are isolated, their importance is not only remembered by their comrades but also by their enemies. The American forces continue to attack them from the sea and air. In other words, to prevent these units from participating in major battlefields, the United States must use considerable force to guard against them. This fact shows the value of these isolated units. Even today, it is still necessary to continue to attack them repeatedly. The American forces have recently experienced this. The Japanese troops in Rabaul have not only repaired their bombed airfields but also repaired the damaged aircraft, launching retaliatory bombings against nearby American bases. These Japanese garrisons have been in constant radio contact with Tokyo, and sometimes they use boats and other means to break through the blockade. Relying on boat supplies, they can obtain various supplies, such as medicines, compressed food, ammunition, etc. They can almost all get sufficient ammunition supplies.</p>
<p>Self-Sufficiency in Food</p>
<p>The Japanese garrison on a certain island suffers from a severe shortage of food because the island is almost entirely barren land with very little arable land, so it cannot produce enough food. However, the garrisons on other islands, especially the Japanese troops in Bougainville and New Guinea, have begun large-scale farming with the belief that they can be self-sufficient in food. American planes often spread poison in these cultivated areas, using various methods to hinder them. Among these isolated units, the Rabaul garrison is particularly outstanding, possessing a large amount of ammunition. In addition, the coastal area of New Guinea is still in the hands of the military, and they show no signs of willingly surrendering. When will the Australian army dare to launch a sweeping battle in that area? It is unknown. The Australian army says that temporarily leaving them alone will not pose a great danger, which actually shows the Australian army's terror. Australian Army Commander Blamey described the situation of these isolated Japanese troops: "From New Guinea to the Solomon Islands, Japanese troops in various places have begun to plant rice in a vast area and have begun to raise livestock."</p>
<p>The anti-Axis forces must always be vigilant against the Japanese troops scattered in the vast areas behind their battle lines. Why? Because if they are not careful, these isolated units will complete their self-sufficiency and gradually regain their offensive power, which will be troublesome. The anti-Axis forces have had practical experience in the past. If the East Indies are also isolated, the monitoring problem will be even more difficult. (Special dispatch from Stockholm on the 28th. Translated from the Daily News, January 30th)</p>

<h3>Chairman Wang Yintai of the North China Political Council Takes Office, Announces Three Points of Governance Policy</h3>
<p>Beijing, 15th (Central News Agency) - The newly appointed Chairman of the North China Political Council, Mr. Wang Yintai, held an inauguration ceremony at 11:00 AM on the 15th in the conference room of the Foreign Affairs Building of the North China Political Council, and announced the following governance policies: Based on the principles of national supremacy and victory first, unite from top to bottom and move towards the path of building a new nation. Strengthen the political system of cooperation between officials and civilians, strive to protect the country and the people, and promote production. Implement sound politics vigorously.</p>
<h3>America Actively Erodes Chongqing's Military Sovereignty</h3>
<p>Forward Base in Guangxi, 16th (Central News Agency) - Since the Xianggui Campaign, the American military's erosion of Chongqing's military affairs and sovereignty has become increasingly blatant. According to recent intelligence, the American military has decided to set up a chief liaison officer of American officers in the newly established Southwest Army and Air Force Headquarters. At the same time, several American liaison officers will be stationed in the new headquarters of Tang Enbo, the commander-in-chief of the Fourth War Zone of the Expeditionary Force in Burma in the Guixiang Border Area, and the new headquarters of Lu Han, the commander-in-chief of the Yuebian Border Area, as well as the headquarters at all levels under their jurisdiction. The task of these liaison officers is to serve as instructors during garrison and to engage in liaison tasks during rotations. On the Chongqing side, one liaison officer is also sent to the American Rear Headquarters and the American Air Force Headquarters, whose business is only in the military finance. Although in the past there were American officers who served as instructors for Chongqing's military operations, there has never been such a large-scale deployment. Although this can be called communication and educational guidance, and reciprocal exchange of liaison officers, it is actually an activation of the American military's erosion of Chongqing's autonomous power, all of which is based on the American military's unilateral actions. According to a staff officer captured during the last Xianggui Campaign, Chiang Kai-shek is quite wary of the American military's erosion of Chongqing's autonomous power.</p>
<h3>Zheng Dazhang Goes to Hefei to Review Troops</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency) - Mr. Zheng Dazhang, military attache of the Military Affairs Committee, was ordered to go to various areas in Anhui to review the National Army in stages. The first phase of the review area was the Xuancheng Shuiyang Town area, which was completed at the beginning of this month. It is now known that Mr. Zheng and the review committee members took the Tianjin-Pukou train to Bengbu yesterday and went to the Hefei area to continue the review.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry Formulates Agricultural Trust Measures</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency) - In order to promote private agriculture and encourage farmers to produce, the Ministry of Industry has formulated economic agricultural trust management measures. Anyone with agricultural experience and enthusiasm for farm management can apply for a trust.</p>

<h3>Goebbels Encourages Germans to Fight for Survival, People's Assault Teams Set Out Enthusiastically</h3>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency: Goebbels wrote an article in the German Weekly entitled "Our Opportunities," saying, "The most terrible war is better than the peace that the enemy forces us to accept, and it is easier to endure. The publication of the war situation is still uncertain, and it must wait until one of the belligerent countries puts down its weapons before it can be determined. As for which side puts down its weapons, it all depends on us. The enemy today certainly has greater operational potential, but it is only material, not spiritual. The enemy does not have a combat goal worth fighting for and worth dying for, but we do. We are fighting to protect the right to live. A country that is determined to fight to protect its existence cannot be conquered. This is our clear opportunity to win victory. Our only savior is courage. Courage will not only gain glory, but also gain victory."</p>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) - A reporter passed by the Olympic Games field last night and saw many people gathered there, but they were not athletes, but people's assault teams. Because it was dark, it was impossible to find out. Soon after the "Peace Bell" of the Olympic Bell Tower rang, several teams of people's assault teams were seen setting out enthusiastically from the rear of the competition field to the front line. The cheers were no less than when the athletes from the United States, France, Finland, and other countries entered the field in 1936. Yesterday, I saw a special team of the people's assault team departing from the competition field in a large military vehicle, and saw that the people's assault team's assault vehicle team carried many assault vehicle guns. The front line has been forced near Berlin, so there was no military band playing when cheering. Berlin's defense is becoming more and more tense, and street roads have been built with defensive works.</p>
<h3>Impressions of Wartime Berlin</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to a special dispatch from the Swedish capital of the "Mainichi Shimbun" here: The Swedish reporter of Dagens Nyheter in Berlin wrote an article on the 10th entitled "War Clouds - Brandenburg at War," reporting on the situation of the Berlin eastern front that he witnessed as follows: We obtained special permission from the German military authorities and arrived at the front line only ten kilometers away from Berlin by car. The impression of what we saw and heard was extremely profound. The German officers who guarded the important strategic locations of bridges and highways posted red signals and ordered us to stop. We showed our passes and obtained their permission to move forward safely. Along the way, we saw German troops engaging in various tasks such as setting up trenches, erecting power lines, and setting up headquarters. In order to prevent the Soviet army from attacking, most of the engineers were doing their best to lay landmines. Various kinds of military vehicles were driving on the highway, most of which were large trucks, winding like long snakes. The full loads slowly came from the east, and the empty boxes hurried west, transporting back and forth endlessly. Soldiers holding military shovels were burying themselves in building positions and fortresses. A large number of Red Army prisoners marched westward in rows from the old prisoner of war camp to the new place. Their mood seemed extremely comfortable, and there was no sign of hesitation or anxiety. The reporters waited until the town not far from the iron field, and it was already bright. The German citizens in the town had not yet evacuated, and refugees passed through in batches with their families as units, transported by horse-drawn carts. The carts were full of fodder, etc., and the address and name were posted on the side of the cart. It can be inferred from this where the Soviet army has arrived. Although they came from a long way, no one was unhappy. When talking about the farms that were sufficient to stay in the Soviet Union, they were silent and did not cry, only revealing an expression of homelessness, no less than the situation of being blindly bombed by enemy planes in the past. A certain young girl said resolutely, "Sooner or later, we will be able to return to our homeland," as the carriage moved forward. In a small courtyard beside a lake near the road, there were four young soldiers sitting and talking about the situation. In order to find out their discussion, the reporters also joined the chat. Unexpectedly, from the tone of their conversation, it was enough to represent the general will of the nation's thinking. They unanimously meant that we would never give up the war, nor would we surrender. No matter how long the war is prolonged, we will never be afraid. No matter how the enemy attacks, the German people will never take the path of suicide. One of them said that if Berlin falls, we are still fighting behind Berlin. Our only slogan is unconditional resistance.</p>
<h3>No Significant Changes in the Western Front</h3>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to Huitong News Agency from responsible sources: The Western front was extremely sluggish the day before yesterday. The anti-Axis forces have weakened their offensive power due to the losses they have suffered in the past few days. The focus of the battle is between the Meuse and the Waal and the Saar area. The battle in the Pötschem area has been greatly weakened, and there are only local battles in the Alsace area. The British and Canadian forces launched another offensive between Emerich and Gennep. The Canadian army advanced along the highway from Cleve to Mehrum, Goch, and Calcar. The British army wanted to advance between the Reichswald Forest and Kleve, but made no progress. To the east and south of the Reichswald Forest, the gap broken by the British tank spearhead was recovered by the German counterattack. The British attempt to expand the bridgehead of the Niers River resulted in heavy losses. After the German army took water release measures on the Roer front, the anti-Axis forces were not very active. The anti-Axis forces are now reorganizing their troops there, and German artillery is concentrating on bombing them. The American army's attempt to expand the bridgehead on the Saar front also suffered heavy losses. The German military continued to engage in defensive battles in the city of Pötschem, repeatedly attacking the American troops who had entered the city. The anti-Axis forces made progress of several hundred meters on the Echternach-Bitburg highway. The American army launched a very small force in Lower Alsace to attack Hagenau and Woerth and was defeated by German artillery fire.</p>
<h3>Soviet Army in Silesia Adopts Encirclement Strategy, Fighting Extends to the Queis River Area</h3>
<p>Silesian Front, 16th (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency: The fighting in Lower Silesia is becoming more and more intense. The Soviet army seems to have an encirclement attempt, penetrating deeply through gaps, occupying towns and strongholds, and forming encirclement pockets. The German army adopts elastic tactics, retreating in time and inflicting heavy losses on the Soviet army. The Soviet army seems to be willing to sacrifice, attacking in the Queis area and near the Breslau-Berlin highway. The Soviet vanguard has crossed the river at Neumarkt and Rothflößchen, and the Sprottau area is also in fierce fighting. Sagan is still in German hands. North of Sagan, the Soviet army crossed the Bober River and attacked Schmottseifen fiercely. The Soviet army entered Neusalz in three routes and was repelled, losing half of its tanks.</p>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to front-line news: The German tank units attacked the flank of Konev's army in the Sagan area, and the powerful vanguard of the Soviet army, which attempted to advance westward with mechanized units, was mostly annihilated in the Sorau area. However, Konev's army in the Silesian region advanced further north to Guben, so that it made contact with the left wing of Zhukov's army. In addition, the Soviet army in the middle reaches of the Warta River has not succeeded in expanding its existing crossing points and new crossings. From a general point of view, the entire line from north of Grünberg to Küstrin is now in the preparation stage for battle.</p>
<h3>Reactions to the Yalta Conference from All Sides</h3>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to German political reports: Judging from the comments of Britain and the United States after the publication of the Yalta Conference communiqué, it is known that Britain and the United States have also recognized Stalin as the only winner in this meeting. The Americans felt somewhat disappointed that the communiqué did not mention the Pacific War. de Gaulle was flattered by the provision in the communiqué allowing France to participate in the implementation of the Yalta Conference resolutions, but on the one hand, he was troubled by the fait accompli. The Polish government in exile was the most opposed country, while another victim, Yugoslavia, expressed its willingness to accept the sacrifice. As for Germany, the Yalta Conference can prove that Roosevelt and Churchill were no match for Stalin, and the new world advocated by the anti-Axis countries is not better than the old world. If the Yalta resolutions are implemented, the social system and way of life of Britain and the United States cannot be applied to the European continent, and the impoverished Europe is not a guarantee of world peace.</p>
<p>The Polish Question</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to a London dispatch: It was later clarified on the details of the Crimean talks that President Roosevelt advocated that at least Lviv should be included in the new territory of Poland on the issue of delimiting the Soviet-Polish border line of the Curzon Line, while Chairman Stalin always insisted that it should belong to the Soviet Union. It was announced that the results of the talks were expected to be at least a favorable solution for Poland in the southern part of the Curzon Line. Due to Chairman Stalin's insistence on Lviv, it has been decided to cede it to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to a London dispatch: The Polish Prime Minister in exile met with a group of reporters on the 15th and expressed his views on the Crimean Conference communiqué as follows: The decision of the Crimean Conference was a major blow to Polish sovereignty. The Polish people were convinced that no Pole residing in London would merge with the Lublin government on the issue of the Allies' re-partitioning of Polish territory and enslaving it. Chairman Stalin chanted democracy, but in fact the Polish people did not trust the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union only plundered Poland and fell into starvation.</p>
<h3>The United States Plans to Participate in the Development of the Eastern Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to German News Agency, the Svenska Dagbladet correspondent in London said: Qualified sources in Washington are now discussing the plan for the United States to participate in the economic development of Siberia, Eastern Russia, and Central Asia. The United States will not only supply machinery, but also purchase its goods. The Soviet government is now conducting negotiations with American businessmen to order heavy industrial machinery and other industrial equipment worth hundreds of millions of dollars. A certain American shipyard has discussed with the Soviet Union the construction of a fleet of merchant ships, and other American businessmen also expect to avoid cold houses. The United States learned that the Soviet Union actually wanted to develop Eastern Russia and Siberia, from the Ural Mountains to the Pacific Ocean. During the war, the Soviet Union's heavy industry was moved to the east, and Siberia was also colonized by Soviet people who escaped from western Soviet Union. This development will continue after the war.</p>
<h3>British House of Commons Debates the Atlantic Charter</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 16th (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency: The British House of Commons discussed the Atlantic Charter last night. Sir William Williams, a Conservative MP, asked whether the Atlantic Charter applied to the Baltic countries. Deputy Prime Minister Attlee refused to answer. Labour MP Sorenson asked why there was no explanation that the Atlantic Charter did not apply to certain countries when it was signed. Attlee replied that the Atlantic Charter could not apply to the enemies of the anti-Axis countries.</p>
<h3>The Truth About the U.S. Marine Corps</h3>
<p>— Zi Ming</p>
<p>In the southwestern Pacific, amidst calls for a general counteroffensive by the United States, the battles have become increasingly fierce. Relying on their massive material resources, they attempt to advance island by island. Ignoring the loss of aircraft carriers, they anxiously prepare for amphibious landings. The Marine Corps is at the forefront of these landing operations. From the landings on Guadalcanal, New Georgia, and Bougainville, to the unprecedented losses suffered in the landings on Makin and Tarawa, and the recent landings on Leyte, Mindoro, and Luzon, the U.S. Marine Corps has always been the vanguard. What kind of force is this Marine Corps, which has become a sacrificial lamb of American imperialism? A brief account is provided below.</p>
<p>The U.S. Marine Corps was established on July 1, 1798. It is said that the founder was John Paul Jones, the "Father of the American Navy." During the War of Independence in 1779, he once used the Bonhomme Richard to destroy the British warship Serapis. From then on, the United States began to have a navy to confront Britain. The headquarters of the U.S. Marine Corps was initially located in Philadelphia, and moved to Washington in 1800, where it remains today.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the U.S. Marine Corps participated in the War of 1812 and the Civil War. In the Spanish-American War, to secure a harbor as a base for the U.S. fleet, they landed at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, providing the navy with an advanced base. The U.S. Navy deeply felt the necessity of having troops accompanying the fleet. During World War I, in addition to ensuring supply lines and guarding harbor bases, they also engaged in joint operations with the army, exceeding the original mission of the Marine Corps, but they were able to demonstrate their capabilities. Furthermore, in the latter half of the 19th century and the 20th century, due to economic and political instability in Western and Central America, and China, there was a need to protect the lives and property of American citizens. The Marine Corps was dispatched abroad, and thus the Marine Corps was repeatedly used as a tool of American imperialist policy.</p>
<p>The Establishment of the U.S. Marine Corps</p>
<p>Good examples include the organized assistance to the Cuban revolt in 1895, the Marine Corps' support during the Hawaiian revolt in 1893 and the subsequent annexation of Hawaii, and the intervention in Nicaragua in the early 20th century.</p>
<p>In short, the U.S. Marine Corps was established for the sake of aggression. The United States faces no threat of invasion from other countries, but since the Spanish-American War, the United States has engaged in numerous wars of the strong preying on the weak. And the vanguard in each of these wars has been the Marine Corps. The reason for organizing this amphibious force, which is neither navy nor army, is that during landing operations, army troops are not accustomed to landing operations, and may suffer from seasickness during transport, making it impossible for them to engage in fierce combat immediately after landing. In such cases, it is much more appropriate to have troops accustomed to marine life undertake the tasks of the army. The Marine Corps was established based on this viewpoint. Furthermore, from the point of view of operational command, it can be said that it is extremely useful for a fleet, in other words, the navy, to have such a directly subordinate land combat force.</p>
<p>The central organ of the U.S. Marine Corps stipulates: "The Marine Corps is a unit of the Navy and must abide by naval laws and regulations. However, the Marine Corps Headquarters is different from other bureaus of the Navy Department and is not a component of the Navy Department. It is a type of army organization suitable for naval conditions, and is subordinate to the Secretary of the Navy, who exercises the powers of the President." It also stipulates that the title of its commander is Major General Commandant, with headquarters in Washington. As for the general capabilities and military discipline of the Corps, he is responsible to the Secretary of the Navy.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the term of office of the Marine Corps commander is four years, appointed by the President. The current U.S. Marine Corps Commander is Lieutenant General Vandegrift, who commanded the landings on Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands in August of the previous year, the landings on New Georgia in June of last year, and the landings on Bougainville. From this point, it can be inferred that the United States will greatly utilize his operational experience in the Solomon Islands to facilitate the future counteroffensive operations in the Pacific.</p>
<p>Difficulty in Replenishing Officers</p>
<p>The number of personnel in the Marine Corps has been codified based on the Advancement Regulations of June 23, 1938. In peacetime, the number of non-commissioned officers and enlisted personnel in the Marine Corps is stipulated to be 20% of the regular naval force, and the number of officers is 5.5% of the statutory number of non-commissioned officers in the Marine Corps. When World War II broke out, the peacetime statutory number of 1,521 officers and 27,497 enlisted personnel, or 39,400 in an emergency, was increased to 2,552 officers and 46,400 enlisted personnel, or 60,000 in an emergency. When the Greater East Asia War broke out, it was further increased. According to the U.S. Secretary of the Navy, the total force reached 100,000 in February 1942, and was expected to double to 200,000 in 1942, and 440,000 by the end of the same year.</p>
<p>Marine Corps officers are graduates of naval officer schools, meritorious Marine Corps warrant officers, or are selected from civilians and are of better quality. However, since the outbreak of World War II, due to the rapid expansion of Marine Corps personnel, it has been particularly difficult to replenish officers.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, after the defeat at Pearl Harbor, the U.S. Marine Corps has been conducting large-scale recruitment propaganda under the slogan "Remember Pearl Harbor," and has also recruited black volunteers. Therefore, by October 2, 1942, the total force had reached 200,000. However, due to the subsequent expansion of armaments and the urgent need for personnel in the defense industry, and the army's implementation of conscription, it was still difficult to recruit large numbers of personnel despite the authorities' efforts to promote recruitment. This is evident from the statement by the U.S. War Manpower Commission on January 12, 1943, that the Navy could also apply the conscription law.</p>
<p>Based on the nature of its assigned tasks, the Marine Corps is divided into Fleet Marine Force, shipboard detachments, and defense forces. Among them, the Fleet Marine Force is an expeditionary force, responsible for occupying or defending forward bases for the air force or navy. Its organizational structure at the time of the outbreak of war, in addition to the 1st Marine Division in Quantico and the 2nd Marine Division in San Diego, also includes seven defense battalions and two air wings. The 1st Marine Division belongs to the Atlantic Fleet, and the 2nd Marine Division is attached to the Pacific Fleet. In September 1941, learning from the lessons of World War II, and to ensure close integration of the navy and air force, amphibious units consisting of Marine divisions, air wings, and army units were created.</p>
<p>Weapons for Landing</p>
<p>The commander of the Pacific Amphibious Force at the time of its creation was Major General Clayton B. Vogel, the predecessor of Lieutenant General Vandegrift. Its headquarters was located in San Diego, and it was composed of the 2nd Marine Division, the 2nd Marine Air Wing, and the 3rd Marine Division, under the command of the Commander of the Pacific Fleet. Its transportation and escort were also handled by the Pacific Fleet, and included high-speed transport squadrons. The organizational structure of the Atlantic Amphibious Force was similar, and the commander was Major General Holland Smith, with headquarters in Quantico.</p>
<p>A brief description of the amphibious tanks and boats used by these amphibious forces is provided below. The U.S. amphibious tanks include the Sea Jeep (small, carrying eight people), the Alligator (large, carrying 60 people), and the DUKW (large, carrying 50 people), all equipped with 7.7mm machine guns and 12.7mm machine guns, and some are equipped with larger caliber machine guns.</p>
<p>As for landing boats, there are use-type boats (carrying eight to ten armed personnel, speed 14 to 15 knots), A-type 36-foot boats (carrying 40 armed personnel, speed 12 knots), B-type 40-foot boats (carrying 50 armed personnel, speed 8 to 10 knots), B-type 75-foot boats (carrying 75 armed personnel, speed 8 to 10 knots), and war transport ships, artillery transport ships, etc.</p>
<p>In addition, these amphibious forces also have parachute troops, barrage balloon squadrons, and glider troops, etc., using mobility to rapidly seize enemy strongholds, kill enemy soldiers, and rapidly and thoroughly destroy various facilities in surprise attacks.</p>
<p>Next are the shipboard detachments, which are stationed on battleships (75 to 85 personnel) and light cruisers (55 to 65 personnel), serving as guards on the ship and as gunners on the side of the ship during combat.</p>
<p>As for the defense forces, they are responsible for defending naval fleets and air bases. Since the outbreak of the war, the value of naval bases has increased, and efforts have been made to modernize and mechanize them. The organizational structure of a base defense anti-aircraft battalion included in the defense forces is as follows: three 3-inch anti-aircraft gun companies (12 guns), one 12.7mm anti-aircraft machine gun company (48 guns), and one searchlight and sound detector company (six searchlights and sound detectors each).</p>
<p>U.S. Marine Corps Tactics</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the battlefield of the Marine Corps is both land and sea, so they not only know how to operate various landing boats, but also perform the duties of infantry and artillery after landing, carrying machine guns, flamethrowers, tanks, and artillery. Among them, the Marine Corps has all the artillery that the army has. They have various modern scientific weapons, and of course, the Marine Corps also has airplanes. During landing, they not only deploy their own aircraft, but also use aircraft carriers to carry out operations in the air. The U.S. Marine Corps also has parachute training, but has not carried out large-scale operations, and has only used a small number of parachute troops in New Guinea and Choiseul Island.</p>
<p>They often stand at the forefront of aggression, and have undergone rigorous training on both land and sea for a long time. Their quality and skills are indeed superior to those of land and naval soldiers. However, since landing on Guadalcanal, they have been beaten by the Japanese army and know that they cannot fight with equal forces. Therefore, they often use several to more than ten times the force to attack.</p>
<p>As for their mode of operation, since New Georgia, they have emphasized thorough artillery bombardment, even completely destroying the land's forests. Otherwise, they land on coasts without Japanese troops and quickly build airfields to gain air supremacy. As for islands like Makin and Tarawa that are not suitable for building airfields, they carry out landings after dropping large iron nets.</p>
<p>They have thorough preparation and training when landing. For example, the detachments that landed on Attu Island were trained for island battles, and the detachments that landed on the southern islands received special training in Australian jungle warfare.</p>
<p>However, it is asked how the Japanese army, which is elite and unparalleled, will thoroughly defeat this Marine Corps, which is the claw of aggression, no matter how it is trained, equipped, or how large its forces are.</p>

<h3>Security Command Refuses Anonymous Accusations</h3>
<p>The city's Security Command has recently received a series of anonymous accusations. After thorough investigation, most of them involve fabricating facts to file false charges and achieve personal gain. It has been learned that in the future, anyone who reports or accuses military law cases to the command must provide a formal petition with details such as name, age, place of origin, and address, sign and seal it, and obtain a shop guarantee. Those using group names must affix the group seal, indicate the location of the group, and have the representative sign and seal it, indicating their age, place of origin, and address, before it will be accepted in accordance with the law. The name of the person reporting will be kept strictly confidential. Anonymous accusations will not be accepted. Citizens are requested to take note.</p>
<h3>Police Bureau Punishes Profiteering Merchants</h3>
<p>Since the sudden surge in prices of grain, vegetables, firewood, charcoal, and other items during the Lunar New Year holiday, it has posed a major threat to the lives of citizens. Therefore, it is hoped that the authorities will quickly take effective measures to sell and adjust prices. The Economic Security Section of the Fourth Department of the Municipal Police Bureau and the Economic Police Team have been conducting strict crackdowns on price increases of food-related items since the 7th until the 12th, and have achieved great results in stabilizing prices. The trend of prices is now being closely monitored. The section and team, with about 100 members, formed a special inspection team. With the cooperation of representatives from related agencies and trade associations, they went to small shops and markets until the 12th to conduct strict investigations on all prices. As a result, [blank] reported two stores exceeding the price limit in the fuel sector, one coal briquette store, and one firewood store. In the food sector, a total of 660 merchants who illegally raised prices, including vegetable vendors and meat shops, were found. Since most of the food merchants are small-scale businesses, the violations were relatively minor. Among the profiteering merchants reported, 360 were fined, 269 were detained, and 30 were given verbal warnings. Fuel merchants were actively manipulating and hoarding, which was extremely egregious. The police bureau has decided to impose severe penalties after the investigation is completed. Furthermore, the police bureau reported that nearly 700 violations were reported in just seven days, which proves that profiteering merchants are manipulating and hoarding to an extreme degree. Therefore, great importance is being attached to this issue. It has been made clear that even more severe punishments will be taken against future violators, and strict surveillance will continue.</p>
<h3>Rectification of Changning Road Police Station: Extortion at the Train Station</h3>
<p>Extortion of travelers at the train station and the selling of black market tickets have become widespread, making it difficult to eradicate in a short period. Currently, Yao Benyuan, the chief of the Changning Road Police Station, who has been in office for just over a week, is actively carrying out the rectification of police affairs. It has been learned that the extortion and illicit sales by officials and police officers at the West Train Station have not ceased. Yesterday, an order was issued to withdraw the entire team back to the branch station for investigation. It is heard that, for the sake of caution, the deputy chief of the branch station first selected seven police officers of good character and integrity. All officers and police were gathered, and assignments were determined by public lottery. Furthermore, Mr. Man Xijiu, the chief police officer of the Third Inspectorate District, was invited to the site to oversee the proceedings. Chen Junqing was selected to take over the defense. It is said that he must personally sign a pledge never to [lacuna] violate regulations, and that any insubordination will be punished according to wartime special military law.</p>
<h3>Financial Bureau Penalizes Four Theaters for Violations</h3>
<p>Since Mr. Luo, concurrently the director, took office at the Municipal Finance Bureau, he has vigorously rectified tax collection. In addition to dispatching staff to investigate day and night, it is learned that the chief of the license section and the head of the entertainment tax division also personally visited various entertainment venues on the 13th and 14th of this month. The Shanghai Opera Theater, the International Grand Theater, the Golden Country Grand Theater, and the Hongbin Theater were found to have violated military regulations. Penalties have been imposed based on the severity of the offenses.</p>
<h3>Route 1 Tram Not Yet Restored</h3>
<p>The city's Route 1 tram was originally scheduled to resume service yesterday. The company also posted notices at various stations announcing the resumption of service. However, it is learned that due to certain procedural issues, service could not be restored yesterday.</p>

<h3>Reader Scholarship News: Shops Turn into Schools, Charity Bazaar Tour</h3>
<p>The red banner of the "Relief for Out-of-School Charity Bazaar" fluttered in the wind. A quarter of an hour before the opening, the enthusiastic crowd was already launching an offensive. Although the gate guards put up a strong resistance, they finally yielded. The crowd surged in, so densely packed that even the quaint advertisements along the [lacuna] building could not be appreciated. It was difficult to ascend to the second floor. What a dazzling spectacle! What a bustling city temple! The painting and calligraphy hall on the left had been transformed into a commercial district. Half of Jiaotong University was a munitions factory. Various gliders, airplanes, warships, etc., meticulously crafted, were on display, reflecting the spirit of the premier mechanical engineering department. Although the scale of Nie Zhongcheng was small, the shouts of the shop assistants added much to the atmosphere. The enthusiasm of Hujiang University had long been renowned. This time, in addition to a large-scale charity sale of ABC candies and CPC coffee, they also produced their own ink and peanut candy. The dining hall that they operated the day before and that John took over yesterday can be considered the most moving contribution to the entire city market. Daily turnover exceeded 200,000, and it was fully occupied from noon onwards. Beautiful female students busily prepared food and served customers. Over twenty kinds of Chinese and Western delicacies were highly praised, and the accompaniment of a splendid orchestra added to the enchantment. At the top of the stairs to the third floor, a sign read, "Hurry! Go up and see the tuberculosis germs fight!" It turned out that the third floor housed the clinics of Tongde and John, each with sections for specimens, examinations, and charity sales. Young doctors explained things in detail and provided services such as heart and lung examinations and blood tests. Descending again to the second floor and entering the market transformed from the library, the High School Affiliated to Shanghai University took the lead and trade was booming. The goods from the Southern Model High School were exquisite, and there were also animal displays. Fudan University was filled with tobacco. Yesterday morning, a concert was held in the auditorium. Mingde's displays were ingenious, Datong mainly sold food and used a gramophone to attract customers, and Qixiu made a variety of pastries. Puppet shows were performed in front of the auditorium in the afternoon, with two acts conveying [lacuna] profound meaning and captivating the audience. The night before, a drama and pantomime were performed to excellent effect, and yesterday afternoon, a comedy was also performed. The gymnasium on the ground floor had been transformed into a large-scale market, broadcasting excited noise. Under the large black characters "As Heaven maintains vigor through movement, a gentleman strives for self-improvement," each shop was engaged in fierce competition. The joint store of Fuyu and the YWCA and the Shanggong store were busy with business. It is said that these two stores were established only after a few students' arduous efforts. Yuqun and Hualian stocked a large quantity of personal items, Kunfan donated dozens of air-raid items, and the total value of Zhengyang's goods was approximately two million, comparable to Fanhangdu. The Hujiang team was the result of twenty-two teams going out to solicit donations. The First Girls' High School stood out by offering delicious desserts. Nanping stored all kinds of cosmetics, Huguang responded to the "one item per person" campaign, with students generously donating hundreds of items, mainly homemade coffee candy, which customers competed to buy. Huadong offered low prices and high sales, stocking goods from central and southern China. Peicheng, Daozhong, Minli, and other girls' schools were set up on gradually ascending grandstands. Although the goods were few, they had already sold out due to their tireless efforts to solicit business. Huxin and Qiaoshang Factories provided an unlimited supply of gold pens and cod liver oil, charging only the cost price. Fanhangdu not only won the ticket sales championship, but also had a large store, with items arranged in long rows and customers rushing to buy them. They also sold valuable paintings and calligraphy donated by Yen Hui-ching and others. After walking around the entire market, customers of all ages were still reluctant to leave. They lingered, admired, praised, and competed to buy. The student shop assistants seemed to have all graduated from commercial colleges and, after engaging in a tireless and persistent battle, finally won. (by Yue Dazeping)</p>
<p>Saving on New Year's Banquets to Contribute to Charity</p>
<p>A letter from all the staff of Cambridge Hospital states: "We are writing to inform you that, according to our usual practice, we have a New Year's dinner. However, at a time when life is difficult and the end of the year is approaching, and in view of the many displaced compatriots suffering from hunger and cold, and the excellent children who have lost their schooling and support and are in urgent need of assistance, although we ourselves are also severely threatened by life, we are fortunate to be able to live and work in peace and do not need factory expenses, so we should economize. Therefore, we are willing to transfer the funds for the banquet given by the hospital director to a beneficial purpose. We have calculated the cost of the canceled banquet, totaling 46,000 yuan in savings certificates. After donating 13,000 yuan to the Orphan Relief and Education Institute and 13,000 yuan to the Old People's Home, we are donating 20,000 yuan in savings certificates to your newspaper to be used for scholarships.

<p>Social Services: "Jian Luan Su" Donated to Impoverished Mothers</p>
<p>An anonymous person sent a letter to this office stating: "I am writing to you because I have seen children abandoned by the roadside, which is truly heartbreaking. I am donating 100 boxes of 'Jian Ru Su' (Baby Darling) to your office for distribution to poor mothers. 'Jian Ru Su' is exclusively managed by Shanghai Guotai Enterprise Company and is based on the female physiological structure, using 'Hongluo Ju' from the South Pacific Islands and extracting its essence through scientific methods. It is effective for mothers suffering from irregular or insufficient milk supply. I am now sending the full amount, hoping that you will inspect and distribute it, providing assistance to poor women who lack milk. I trust that your office will be happy to do so."

<h3>Mayor Lin Football Quarterfinals: Donghua and Huatong Clash, Zhongpu Defeats China with Five Goals</h3>
<p>The second act of the Zhong Xiao Huai Football Tournament was held at the racecourse on the first day of the Lunar New Year. The Chinese team defeated Portugal 5-0, with a score of 2-0 at halftime. The Chinese team's lineup was based on friendship, supplemented by the goalkeeper of Zishi Jie, the midfield of Meng Yiliang Yu Lizhao, and the forwards Yu Liming, etc. Members of the Donghua team did not attend.</p>
<p>The International Huai Football Tournament opened at Jiaozhou Park on the 14th, with Italy eliminating Japan 3-1.</p>
<p>In the Mayor Huai Quarterfinals, Donghua and Huatong tied 1-1. Sun Jinshun charged straight in and kicked the ball near the goal seven minutes before the end of the first half. Unexpectedly, Sun had committed a handball, so the goal should not have been counted. However, Fadafu ruled that the goal was valid, leading to a dispute. The Huatong players left the field, and the referee ruled that Huatong had forfeited the match. However, Huatong was persuaded to return to the field and continue playing, but stated that the remainder of the match would be played in a friendly spirit. Therefore, the two teams each scored another goal in the second half, ending the game in a 2-2 draw. The final decision on the outcome of the match is pending the authorities' decision.</p>

<h3>Several Practical Methods for Evacuating the Population</h3>
<p>-- Yu De</p>
<p>The necessity of evacuating the population has been discussed extensively by all parties and has already progressed from the theoretical stage to the implementation stage. However, evacuating one million people to other places is no easy task. Empty exhortations will not work, nor will it suffice to simply send one million people out of the city limits. It is necessary to have a thorough and appropriate plan in advance, and rapid and effective action is especially important. Afterwards, long-term means of livelihood should be considered for the evacuees. I will now present a few points within my limited knowledge for the reference of those in charge of the evacuation work.</p>
<p>The first problem to be solved is the transportation problem. At present, railways and waterways can certainly be used, but relying solely on railways and limited ships to evacuate one million people in a short period of time is almost impossible. Even if one more train is added every day, it can only evacuate 3,000 people, which is only 100,000 a month, which is simply not enough to meet the actual needs and adapt to the current emergency situation. Therefore, if one month is used for the period of preparation and registration, and one month is used for the period of evacuating the first million people, then not only must railways and waterways be relied upon, but also walking should be adopted.</p>
<p>Regarding evacuation by walking, there have been many precedents in various places in the past ten years, so there is no need to say more here. If this method is adopted, the following should be done:</p>
<p>(1) Solve the problem of protection along the way. A special escort team should be formed by the Security Command of this city, under the Jurisdiction of the escort division of the evacuation committee, to protect the safety of several designated evacuation routes.</p>
<p>(2) Requisition all of the city's rickshaws and even handcarts, and in accordance with the transportation system in the interior, form transportation stations section by section, under the Jurisdiction of the transportation division of the evacuation committee, to transport the luggage of the evacuees.</p>
<p>Regarding this point, it is necessary to explain in more detail. If the speed of walking per day is 40 li, then the evacuation line should be divided into sections of 40 li each, and a transportation station should be set up at the beginning and end of each section, and a certain number of rickshaws, handcarts, or other vehicles should be assigned to each section. Those who need vehicles to transport luggage only need to apply to the transportation station and pay a fee. The transportation station will collect the fee in full at one time according to the weight and size of the luggage, and then assign the vehicle in turn to transport it. The transportation station at the starting point will issue two receipts, one to the consignor and one to the carrier. When arriving at the end point, both receipts will be given to the transportation station at the end point at the same time. The consignor will pick up the goods with the receipt, and the carrier will pick up the money with the receipt, so that there will be no difficulties in demanding or extorting, and no complicated bargaining. The next day, the second and third transportation sections will be responsible for sending it to the designated evacuation destination.</p>
<p>Why change vehicles every day? Because assuming that 500 vehicles are assigned to each section, the transportation station in that section must strictly manage these 500 vehicles, register them in detail, and obtain a guarantee (or joint guarantee) to prevent theft or escape along the way. The transportation station must be absolutely responsible to the consignor.</p>
<p>As for the requisition of rickshaws, handcarts, or other vehicles, it is not without cost. On the one hand, a relatively fair transportation fee should be stipulated. On the other hand, it should be stipulated that a certain amount of daily necessities such as rice and firewood can be legally transported on the return journey to supply the needs of the city. Not only the amount to be transported should be stipulated, but even the price should be stipulated, so that the carriers in this section can resell them to the carriers in the next section. The resulting profit will be used as the carrier's reward for assisting in the evacuation.</p>
<p>(3) The evacuation destinations should be designated as several cities that are relatively worthless in military terms. The local county government must also participate in the evacuation committee. The county government should immediately investigate the local housing situation, stipulate that each person can only occupy a certain number of square feet of housing. Those who exceed this number should rent it out. Anyone who believes that there are no vacant houses to rent should obtain a certificate from the Baojia, and the county government will issue a certificate to be posted outside the door. If houses without certificates refuse to rent, the government can be petitioned to enforce it. Only in this way can the housing problem for the evacuees be solved.</p>
<p>(4) When evacuating, the government should stipulate that citizens are allowed to carry certain types of goods below a certain amount. For example, each person can carry industrial products such as cigarettes and matches worth less than 50,000 yuan. If a family of about five can bring about 200,000 yuan worth of goods to the interior, they will not have to worry about having no means of production and sitting idle. A large amount of industrial products accumulated in the city can at most be used as a bargaining chip for hoarding, and it also violates the principle of dispersing wartime materials. If they are transported to the countryside, they will help the circulation of money and gradually recover the cash that has flowed into the countryside in large quantities due to the purchase of food.</p>
<p>(5) Regarding restricting the population from returning to Shanghai from the interior, the government should painstakingly formulate detailed measures. I believe that anyone who returns to their hometown should have their residence permit revoked. Those without a Shanghai residence permit should not be allowed to pass through the inspection station. Railway and waterway transportation agencies should sell [lacuna] tickets based on the Shanghai residence permit (except for those with civil servant identification cards). This method has already been implemented in some cities, and it has not had any adverse effects on the flow of goods, etc. (In case of special circumstances, a "return permit" can be applied for from the Shanghai Municipal Government.)</p>
<p>In short, evacuating the population is a complicated and difficult task. Not only should detailed measures be stipulated in advance, but also extensive publicity and guidance should be carried out. The implementation should also be revised at any time and anywhere. Only in this way can the suffering of the evacuees be reduced and the evacuation work can proceed smoothly.</p>

<p>Explanation</p>
<p>Secretariat: The Municipal Government Secretariat is the nerve center of the Municipal Government. All important instructions from the Municipal Government to various bureaus and offices are issued by the Secretariat, and the daily work performance of all affiliated agencies is also managed by the various organizations of the Secretariat. The Secretariat is directly commanded by the Mayor's Secretary-General, without a separate director. Each group (soon to be changed to section) has one head and one deputy head, with about ten assistants. The three sections of General Affairs, Documents, and Personnel each have a section chief and an assistant, and a number of section members and clerks. Each of the Research and Translation offices has one director and several assistants. Special Commissioners and Counselors are responsible for handling specially assigned matters, such as investigating incidents, reviewing engineering projects, studying education, and reviewing unresolved regulations.</p>
<p>Police Bureau: The scope of the Police Bureau is the largest among all bureaus and offices under the Municipal Government. This is partly because the urban area is too large, and the Police Bureau was formed by the merger of the former patrol houses of the two concessions and the old municipal police bureau. Secondly, the current national government's policy guidelines clearly list security as a priority, so the police force must be fully utilized. The unique feature of the Shanghai Police Bureau compared to other places is that Chinese and foreign police officers are jointly responsible for performing duties. Currently, in addition to Chinese, there are personnel of Japanese, French, Russian, and Indian nationalities in the police force, who can all give full play to their strengths, cooperate with each other, and jointly maintain the security of Greater Shanghai.</p>
<p>Finance Bureau: The organizational system chart of the Finance Bureau listed in this article is the most recent situation. Under the principle of implementing organizational streamlining, the three independent agencies of the Special Consumption Tax Office, the General Accounting Office, and the Municipal Treasury were merged and absorbed, and changed into sections to achieve the effect of rapid handling of affairs and saving expenses. With sound finances, municipal administration can be promoted, so the Finance Bureau makes the greatest contribution to municipal administration.</p>
<p>Economic Bureau: The Economic Bureau is a product of the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, and its wartime responsibilities are considered to be second only to the Police Bureau among the various bureaus and offices of the Municipal Government. However, the situation in Shanghai is special. For example, daily necessities for citizens such as rice, cooking oil, coal, kerosene, vegetables, and fruits each have specially established control agencies, and the Economic Bureau cannot directly manage them. However, fluctuations in the prices of these many commodities can affect general price levels, so the Economic Bureau in Shanghai is currently dealing with considerable difficulty.</p>
<p>Bureau of Public Utilities: The parts of the Bureau of Public Utilities that are closely related to citizens were originally water, electricity, telephones, gas, etc., but now citizens' contact with the Bureau of Public Utilities is mostly limited to land transportation vehicle registration and vehicle management. In fact, the work of the Third Section is the most burdensome, and the management of other public utilities is placed in a secondary position.</p>
<p>Bureau of Public Works: Except for the General Affairs Section, the various sections of the Bureau of Public Works mostly work in technical fields. Each section has a head and a deputy head. Under the sections, there are also various groups. In the technical field, there are still foreign personnel serving.</p>
<p>Bureau of Education: The organization and responsibilities of the Bureau of Education are clearly defined. There is no need for unnecessary explanation. Only the affairs of the municipal schools in the old First to Eighth Districts in the Sixth Section are special because the organizational system of the municipal schools in the old First to Eighth Districts is completely different from other public and private schools. In the future, gradual changes can be expected to unify them.</p>
<p>Bureau of Health: The work of the Bureau of Health also includes much school health. In the past, the pathological examination and chemical analysis work during the era of the Public Works Department were the most well-known. Currently, among the work of the various sections, the most important are the environmental sanitation of the Third Section and the garbage removal of the Seventh Section. Environmental sanitation, such as the sampling of all unclean food and beverages on the market and the prevention of infectious diseases, are all things that cannot be ignored during wartime. In particular, the Seventh Section is responsible for removing garbage and excrement. Recently, the accumulation of garbage on city streets has hindered the city's appearance, so the work of the bureau in the future is also very difficult.</p>
<p>Bureau of Land Administration: Among the various bureaus of the Municipal Government, the Bureau of Land Administration has the least contact with citizens, and its nature is the most specialized. Those terms sound incomprehensible. However, this department is also indispensable, otherwise land problems cannot be solved, and how can any municipal administration begin?</p>
<h3>Issue of Preferential Treatment for Military Police at Entertainment Venues</h3>
<p>— Feng Shuren</p>
<p>In recent years, various entertainment venues have not been aware of providing preferential treatment to military police and public officials, which has often led to misunderstandings. The author believes that the above phenomenon is a major obstacle to local security. I dare to contribute a few points based on the experience of employees in the entertainment industry.</p>
<p>(1) Stipulate half-price preferential treatment: This is a common practice in various countries. Regardless of the type of entertainment venue, a special half-price ticket for military police should be set up. All military police and public officials are limited to themselves and must be neatly dressed and able to present proof documents as a necessary condition for enjoying half-price preferential treatment.</p>
<p>(2) Regularly scheduled free performances: In addition to the daily business performance hours of entertainment venues, a specific day or performance should be specifically to entertain military police and public officials of various agencies, all free of charge. The military or responsible agency should appoint a commissioner to be responsible for taking care of the venue. If there is more than one entertainment venue in the local area, they may as well take turns performing in stages.</p>
<p>(3) Special preferential seats for military police: Xiantian military police and various agencies should jointly form a Military Police Entertainment Guidance and Management Committee to be responsible for handling matters. According to the seating capacity of each entertainment venue, its performance nature, and the area where it is located, specify the number of special heavy police preferential seats separately, and issue admission tickets according to the quota on a daily basis. All military police and public officials must first receive an admission ticket, and then take it to various designated entertainment venues to exchange for seat tickets. When exchanging tickets, special attention must be paid to checking documents, and it is still limited to those who wear uniforms and wear badges to prevent impersonation and resale.</p>
<p>(4) Special performances of educational entertainment: In this extraordinary period, in order to reward the hard work of military police and public unified leaders, it is possible to choose beneficial educational and entertaining entertainment, and arrange for regular performances in various agencies or public venues, such as dramas, plays, and movies.</p>
<p>The above proposals, if implemented one of them, can avoid many disputes, and will greatly benefit the social order and security, and are especially closely related to the future of the entertainment industry.</p>
<h3>Symposium on Price Issues (II) Previous article can be found on page 4 of the February 10th edition</h3>
<p>Mr. Chen, the president of this newspaper: Mr. Funatsu is not only an authority in the Japanese economic community in China, but also has in-depth research on the economic phenomena in Shanghai. I believe he must have unique insights on this.</p>
<p>Funatsu Tatsuichiro: The first question is the standard for price assessment. As far as I know, Article 5 of the "Provisional Regulations on Wartime Price Management" promulgated by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce on January 13 last year stipulates the standard for price assessment, which is to deduct transportation costs, administrative expenses and all donations and taxes, and then add profits. The profit of the wholesale price shall not exceed 10%, and the retail price shall not exceed 20%.</p>
<p>During the tenure of the former director, the calculation of production costs was determined according to the following items: (1) Raw materials (2) Wages (3) Electricity (Power) (4) Transportation costs (5) Interest (6) Production equipment depreciation (7) Donations and taxes (8) Business expenses.</p>
<p>The current Secretary Chen of the Price Evaluation Committee calculates prices according to three categories: (1) Agricultural products, (2) Industrial products, and (3) Raw materials. The calculation standards are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Agricultural products: 1. Place of origin price, 2. Transportation costs, taxes, and regulations on retail profits.</p>
<p>(2) Industrial products: 1. Raw material prices, 2. Fuel or power, 3. Direct production costs, 4. Indirect production costs, 5. Interest and depreciation, 6. Changes in various indexes (such as living, wholesale, and retail indexes), 7. Wholesale and retail profits.</p>
<p>(3) Raw materials: 1. Agricultural products are calculated according to item (1), 2. Imported goods are determined by referring to the exchange rate of inventory in the black market, 3. Controlled goods are calculated by referring to the purchase price and market conditions, 4. Industrial products are calculated according to item (2).</p>
<p>For the above three items, the total price is applied for by the trade association.</p>
<p>The second question is how to deal with the black market: (1) Cooperate with the investigation and information network organization, (2) Stipulate the registration and transfer procedures of resources, and (3) Designate transaction methods, such as establishing a tacit market for rice in Zhoujiaqiao and other locations.</p>
<p>The third question is how to manage resources, and special attention should be paid to cracking down on hoarding by non-industry people: (1) Thoroughly investigate bank and money house loans, (2) Conduct secret investigations: (1) The purchase and sales situation of major firms, (2) The income and expenditure situation of banks and money houses, (3) Inventory, (3) Thoroughly investigate the official registered capital and actual operating capital of firms, (4) Conduct irregular investigations of warehouses, (5) Investigate those who falsely claim to be members of the public association.</p>
<p>The fourth question is how to organize public associations, which should be done: (1) In terms of personnel: investigate false public associations for the sake of private police matters, eliminate and organize them. (2) In terms of organization: (1) Merge similar public associations (there are as many as five firewood industry associations), (2) Establish a Baojia organization within the public association, which must be cell-like, so that opinions can be communicated from top to bottom, and thoroughly promote the spirit of abiding by the law. (3) Strictly select the supervisors of the public association, and no longer set up nominal positions and employ private individuals (in the past, the supervisors did not actually come to work every day), (4) There are many operators who do not join the public association at present, and this matter should be cracked down on. (5) Train members - use meeting methods to make members aware of the current situation, promote the spirit of abiding by the law, and support the spirit of the municipal government and cooperation with the municipal government.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen, the president of this newspaper: Mr. Funatsu spoke very comprehensively and in detail. Now please ask Mr. Xiang Kangyuan to express his opinion.</p>
<p>Xiang Kangyuan: In the wartime economy, leveling prices is the most difficult to solve smoothly, because there are many kinds of materials, and everything about the sources of raw materials, transportation costs, and power supply can affect its costs and increase the selling price of goods, and each item is interconnected, making it difficult to solve them locally. Therefore, in order to manage prices, if you want to level the entire fleet, it is inevitable that you will get half the results with twice the effort, and you will not be rewarded for your efforts. In order to meet the actual situation, it is better to adopt a key system. For example: select a few necessities of life, such as rice, firewood, vegetables, silk cloth, cooking oil, soap, and matches. The government must ignore all the difficulties and obstacles and use its full strength to level them, so as to stabilize the minimum level of people's livelihood. For the rest of the goods, those that have no direct relationship with the public may as well let them rise and fall naturally, and there is no need to do fruitless work. If people with superior financial resources buy some non-essential items at high prices, they do not care, so why should the government work hard to manage all secondary materials, so that if it is not done well, it will turn into a joke that the black market is lower than the limited price (such as shirts)?</p>
<p>According to observations over the past three years, the rise in all prices seems to be led by the rise in rice prices, so if the price of rice can be reduced as much as possible, the rising momentum of other materials can also be slightly reduced. On the contrary, if the price of rice cannot be leveled, and it continues to soar, then trying to reduce the price of other materials is like climbing a tree to catch fish.</p>
<p>At present, in order to suppress the prices of daily necessities, (A) passive aspects: (1) We must use all our political power to strictly prohibit the heavy extortion at the place of origin and during transportation. Using heavy punishment in troubled times can be implemented in this situation. (2) In terms of finance, adopt a strict policy of contracting currency and credit to reduce hoarding power. (B) In active aspects: (3) The government should assist various public organizations to purchase a large amount of products from the place of origin to Shanghai, and the army and police should protect them along the way to eliminate all exploitation, so as to enrich the source. (4) Restore the power supply of various factories as soon as possible, because the production of various factories is now stagnant due to the lack of power, which not only reduces the supply of materials, but also still contains a lot of workers, who consume materials and do not produce, which inevitably poses a threat to the weight of the stock of goods, so the price of goods will rise endlessly. Therefore, restoring factory power is an important item in the price policy, and I hope the authorities will pay close attention to it.</p>
