<h3>仁牙因海岸地帶　日精銳勇猛作戰　斃敵六千鹵獲大量戰利品</h3>
<p>東京二十二日中央社電　日大本營二十二日下午三時發表：（一）仁牙因　沿岸登陸敵軍主力，邇來對達莫爾迭斯附近，至卡巴朗附近一帶之日軍第一綫陣地，續行攻擊，敵軍一部侵入日軍第一綫第二綫陣地中間之波索魯比奧附近，當地日軍部隊勇戰敢鬥，陸續摧毀敵軍之攻擊。（二）自敵軍登陸以來，日軍在該方面陸戰所收獲之戰果，截至十九日業經判明主要者如次：殺傷敵人員六千名以上，鹵獲破壞敵砲五十九門，戰車六十七輛，汽車二十六輛，幕舍四十二座，其他兵器彈藥糧　等多數。</p>
<p>仁牙因前綫二十二日中央社電　呂宋島敵軍企圖以機動部隊，向呂宋平原展進，數日來沿馬尼刺公路南下，但其企圖巳爲日軍所阻止。日軍並由海灣在敵軍後方逆登陸，以挺身隊阻止其前進，故敵軍進展極爲遲緩。其備有戰車之部隊，雖南下若干地點，然其主力仍停滯於仁牙因海岸地帶。十九日敵主力一部向比提東北之日軍基地接近，經日軍猛烈反攻擊退。達莫爾迭斯拉朋方面携有迫撃砲四門之敵軍兩大隊，自海岸作緩慢之砲撃，經日軍猛攻後即吿沉默。又侵入於拉朋東方四公里之美軍，日軍正掃蕩中。敵軍一大隊以戰車數輛爲前導，日來企圖迂迴攻擊侵入波索魯比奧，（聖法比安東方十五公里）日軍精銳予以猛擊，殺減其八名將至擊退。敵自登陸以來瘋狂亂射之重砲，經日軍挺身突擊隊及火燄放射隊晝夜活躍，已趨沉默，然敵之物量及戰意仍未見衰，兩軍主力雖未接觸，然情形極度緊張。</p>
<h3>台灣附近海面　敵艦四艘重創　日神風隊發揮特攻精神</h3>
<p>東京二十二日中央社電　呂宋島戰綫敵軍，自三日以來，於巴士海峽及中國南海方面，再度出動有力機動部隊，以其艦載機分別空襲台灣沖繩及華南各地。二十一日曾以四百五十架艦載機於台灣沖繩方面反覆來襲，是日，日軍神風特別攻擊隊分成二隊，於直掩機護衛下，對此敵機動部隊敢行必中之猛攻，前後將敵空母三艘及艦型不詳者一艘予以重創，並起大火。日軍特攻隊以一機擠一艘之攻擊而發揮偉大之特攻精神，爰二十一日過午，日神風特攻隊之一隊曾於台灣東方若干喱之海面，將敵機動部隊之一羣包圍，當即對之實行猛攻，日軍一機當即命中敵大型空母一艘，使之起大火，又其他一機會命中敵軍一大型空母艦之艦首，而使之重傷。又其他日軍特工隊之一隊，亦於是於台灣近海之敵機動部隊一羣包圍，與敵直衛機展開熾烈之空戰後，即突入敵艦，以飛機一架命中敵航空母艦一艘，其他以機亦命中艦型不詳之敵艦一艘，而使之分別期貨燃燒，此戰果業經日軍直捲機確認。又遭日軍衝撞攻擊而起火之敵空母艦，均受日軍特別攻擊隊猛烈攻擊，所謂重傷起大火者，實與擊沉無異，其損害實甚大。</p>
<h3>襲台灣敵機　毀五十九架</h3>
<p>東京廿二日中央社電　據台北電話，台灣軍廿一日下午五時發表：廿一日八時許迄下午五時敵艦載機累計四百五十架來襲本島及沖繩島，現在正在交戰中，敵機主要投彈於飛機塲外，並對都市及村落數處加以掃射轟炸，日方飛機塲及其他損害輕微。至現在止判明戰果，計擊落敵機三十八架擊毀二十一架。</p>
<h3>日眾院昨舉行　全體會議　石渡藏相說明戰時財政</h3>
<p>東京二十二日中央社電　日眾院二十二日上午時半舉行全體會議，討論要案：　關於爲充實昭和二十年度一般會計歲出財源等所發行之公價法案，　外資金庫法案，十八名委員根據石渡藏相提案理由之說明，詳加討論，最後各委員爲追念各故議員之功績，相互發表追悼演說，至十一時五十七分圓滿散會。</p>
<p>東京二十二日中央社電　二十一日舉行之眾院會議席上，石渡藏相之財政演說要旨如次：昭和二十年度之歲入歲出總預算，歲入歲出均爲二百二十四億餘圓，施策之重點乃置重於增强戰力及確保食糧，而對完遂作戰上特別緊要之項目，當努力使其經費增加，又爲努力使其經費增加，又爲適應戰局之推移，確保預算機動性，決增加國庫預備費。第一預備費二億元，第二期預備費二十億元，如此戰時預算已無遺憾完成。又自中國事變爆發以來，發行之公債總額爲八百四十九億七千餘萬圓，銷出額爲七百六十七億九千餘萬圓，銷出額爲二百五十億一千餘萬圓，是故以公債爲戰費財源活用，及預算之執行等，業無任何障碍，而使公債銷路趨暢。國民儲蓄增加目標額爲四百十億日圓，觀其實際成績，至下半年度上半期銀行貯金約爲百五十四億日圓，郵政儲金約爲七十九億日圓，合計其他各種儲金等，增加額巳達三百四十五億日圓。關於空襲等非當時之經濟對策，前已確立戰時非常金融對策，前，又創設戰時特種損害保險制度，幷講求減負租稅及其他各般措置，曾逐次整備强化，此等制度已漸次澈底化，於非常事態時對於民生之安定上，漸收相當效果。其次對於大東亞共榮圈內之各國家各民族，於財政上經濟上曾予以莫大援助，協力其經濟上至發展，實早爲國人所知，今後雖於苛烈之戰局下排除萬難，今後亦不惜予以全力支援，更傾注全力於建設大東亞經濟。</p>
<h3>日對華將實施　新經濟政策　重光氏答議員問</h3>
<p>東京二十二日中央社電　日眾議員金光庸夫氏，於二十一日曾就對華政策向重光外想提出質問，當答以善隣維持友邦關係，並謂爲改善中國之窮困經濟，刻正考慮新經濟政策。重光外相力言，基於外交五原則，積極協力中日提携之實現，爲期其實現，必先確言善隣友好關係，將英美之侵略勢力，完全自中　驅逐凈盡，及共同努力，以謀中國之全面和平，並依平等互惠之基礎。於目下解決中國急迫之經濟狀態問題，當以對華方經濟政策，與中國方面提携改善。對此新經濟政策，重光外相雖未加具體之說明，然由其積極的誠意觀之，頗堪期待。</p>
<h3>日本作戰目的　子啊建立永久和平　日重光外相關明外交方針</h3>
<p>親和協力　復興東亞　菲律賓之防禦，成爲東亞防禦之焦點，故此次美國開始的侵略後，菲律賓立即毅然對美宣戰，在大總統洛勒爾之指導下與日軍同甘共苦從事酣戰，此事實爲全世界同所注目者。保衛東亞之另一戰爭當推緬甸，緬甸獨立以來巳一年有半，在巴莫國家代表卓越之指導下，立於解放亞細亞戰之最前綫，繼續奮鬥，實爲東亞人揚眉吐氣。印度之解放，乃亞洲解放之關鍵，爲顯揚世界正義之重點，有識之士早有定評，鮑斯主席率領自由印度軍隊爲解放印度致最大之努力，預料其其前途雖有幾許困難，但深信最後必能完成偉業。泰國爲日本之同盟國，新內閣巳組織成立，而與日本協力，互相對復興東亞之偉業致最大之努力，實令人興奮。有構成日本戰力主要背景者厥爲滿洲國，滿洲國與日本一心一德，鞏固盟約於物心兩方面，處在完全之協力關係中，其對貢獻日本戰力者至大至鉅。</p>
<p>對華政策平等互惠</p>
<p>中華民國偉大東亞先覺者，汪故主席於全面和平實現之中道崩殂，不獨在中國，即在東亞亦爲一大損失，日本政府深爲痛惜。惟汪氏雖死，精神猶存，國民政府今則在陳公博氏指導下，繼承汪故主席之遺訓，及國父之遺敎，一致團結，以同生共死之精神，盡瘁於中日之協力。日本之對華政策，於所謂新政策實施以來，巳爲確固不拔者，今後亦將根據此旣定方針，於政治方面經濟方面，排除一切困難，澈底予以實踐，余擬　此次機會，就以中國爲中心之國際問題，略述一言。英國政策在使亞洲人互相戰爭而收漁人之利，美國亦繼承之，此已明顯呈露。彼等明知日</p>
<p>和平實現全面撤兵　其施策實爲破壞東亞安定之大敵，此種破壞政策，終與日本建設政策不能相容。日本對華政策之目的，係基於共同互惠之關係，建立新興中國，中日兩國前曾約定當中而使中國還於中國人之手。吾人所祈念者，厥爲互相隊復興東亞之偉業有所貢獻，時至今日，由於日軍之進攻，巳打開南北通路，餘美軍基地以莫大打擊，於政戰兩略上，收獲完全一致之戰果，此誠堪慶賀者也。</p>
<p>日本作戰目的　在建立永久和平　日重光外相闡明外交方針　（續完）</p>
<p>本到底不能屈伏，故始終　使中國供其利用，以達其非望，使中日相爭，並以甘言及威力，驅使中國於抗日戰綫，彼等以犧牲中國而轉嫁對日戰爭之自己負擔，圖在大陸逞其獨占排他之　野望。</p>
<p>國和平實現之時，日本由中國全面撤兵，大東亞戰爭因中日問題而發生，自應歸還於中日問題，中國恢復正常狀態後，東亞之安定始能確保。日本今使日軍向華南進攻，其目的在於打擊美國軍隊，由中國驅逐美國之擾亂勢力，</p>
<p>日蘇友誼保持不變　日本與中立國之關係，在事實上，除在英美勢力下者以外，均排除戰時之困難，繼續維持友好關係，此與過去並無變化，尤其瑞典瑞士及西班牙各國代管日本在敵國之利益，長久保護日本僑民，日本對此深表感謝。又日本與蘇聯之關係，乃由中立條約而奠定者，兩國政府鑑於日蘇兩國目前在世界政局中之地位，故常保持密切之聯絡，如去年三月締結並發表之利權移讓恊定之實行，及依照漁業條約之漁業權之行使等，均在順利進展中。惟世界之永久和平，以英美之武力政策，終未能達到目的，世界之和平，須俟各國間之親善與協力，方能實現，大東亞宣言之精神，實在於此。</p>
<p>重申外交五大原則　余在日本議會中聲明之日本外交五大原則，亦即以此爲根據之具體國策，第一，國際間以平等互惠爲主旨，使善隣友好之關係充分發展，以開關各民族各國家相互親切之新天地，以期奠定永久之和平。第二，尊重民族主義之政策，使各民族各國家各得其所。第三，依照不干涉內政之主義，不問國之大小，應互相尊重其主權及獨立，其統治之形式及指導理念，爲各國內政問題，各國對比不可干涉。第四在經濟之分野上，以協力爲旨趣，實現互惠之原則，通商交通之自由發達，以及資源之互相解放。第五，促進又文化之國際交流，以貢獻世界之和平與進展。</p>
<p>正義之師終必獲勝　總之，日本之主張在建設不威脅不侵略之世界，日本政策之本意，爲使世界各國充分理解起見，應當採取一切手段，然日本公正之政策，必爲各國所一致稱讚。日本作戰目的，深信必爲世界所承認，正義之戰爭必獲勝利，此即爲吾人所以充滿必勝信念者也。</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>上海市屬七縣應加調整</h3>
<p>上海市屬的南匯·川沙·崇明·奉賢·寶山·嘉定·申江等七縣，與上海市唇齒相輔。從地形上言，這七縣處於外圍，拱衛着上海。再從上海市民生活物資的來源言，這七縣是上海市民的生命綫。在治安上言，這七縣密邇上海，任何一縣的治安發生問題，都足以影響到上海的治安。居於如此重要地位的七縣，當此上海市政正圖踏上軌道之際，除將上海市本身健全之外，還須着限到外圍縣區政治上的調整，使與上海市政同一步調，納入正軌，不致有偏廢而影響到上海市政健全施策的推行，非常必要。所謂照顧全局，大處着眼，小處着手是也。</p>
<p>上海是东亚共荣圈内最重要的都市，它的一動一變，可以牽動全國。敵機幾次來襲，雖是神經戰術作用，但到戰事進到更緊急階段，敵美何嘗無軍事擾亂的妄想，儘管有完全之策，使敵人夢想皆成泡影。然而我們不能不再作精密周詳的防備，寗可備而不用，決不可使敵人有萬一之逞。這個責任，放在新任市政長官的肩上，因時局的緊迫而更加着重，成爲刷新市政工作中重要課題之一。這個課題，不僅要策謀上海市本身的安固，須使外國的七個縣區，能同時同樣的健全安固起來，則上海的安固纔算有了基礎。在決戰關頭，眞正担負起後方基地的使命，協力爭取前方的勝利。從這一點上來計劃建設上海的市政，必須着眼到市屬七縣，與市政連成一體，着手調整，鞏固外圍，此其一。</p>
<p>安定民生，是新任市政長官刷新市政的第一目標，周市長市民書中的主要意旨，是爲市民減少痛苦，羅秘書長就職談話中提出的三點，根本精神，是在保證切實做到減少痛苦，簡單的說，便是安定民生。以目前情形論，物價有平穩的氣象。如果假以時日，整飭風紀，勵行廉潔政治，著有相當成效時，民生可以更見安定。再能配以有計劃的增加生產，民生安定，當更有保障。但我們鑒於「功虧一簣」的古訓，不能無深遠的謀慮。上海民生所以如此嚴重，原因很多，已爲人人熟知的政治常識，當局早已洞悉其病因，準備了藥，正對症下藥，毋須我們再來嘮叨。然而有一點，我們須提醒，過去民生動搖，固由上海市的政治去負責，不過鄰郊縣區以鄰爲壑的政策，並非無影響。譬如上海市民所需的物資，都取給於四鄕，在運輸不暢時，仰給於所屬縣區的供應必繁。而這些縣的縣政設施，各自爲政，貪污勒索，增高物價，直接影響到上海市政，安定民生，同時也須調整市屬七縣的綫政，安定民生，努力增產，此其二。</p>
<p>與民生安定同樣重要的治安問題，上海市的治安，因警衛與保甲組織比較完密的縣區爲巢穴，窺伺上海，乘機而動，同時又以這些縣區爲逃逋藪。所以確立上海治安，不能單以上海市爲本位，必須使　鄰縣區的治安亦能確立。那末，勢必調整市屬七縣的縣政，此其三。</p>
<p>基於上述三點，我們覺得上海市區很重要，外圍縣區也很重要，有與上海市政同時着手調整的必要，不如是，不足以臻完善之境。至於如何調整我們覺得應從人事。財政和治安三方面着手。</p>
<p>人事上的调整，首先要换去以「發財」爲目的的官吏，著有劣蹟者，不僅徹換，而且要按情節輕重，加以懲辦。一般奉公守法，公正康明的官吏，即使資力稍差，應予獎勵，淬發官塲廉明風氣，所謂懲前　後是也。其次，需以建立專家政治爲原則，爲政者存了「五日京兆」的心，而能建樹良好的政績，是不可能的事。上層領導者能埋頭苦幹，以身作則，盼望中下層被領導者能本着苦幹實幹硬幹的精神去做，不敷衍，不因循，不茍安，不辭勞怨，不打官腔，第一要使他們能安於位，肯埋頭苦幹。這樣，始能發揮專長，同時可能培養非專門者成爲善良的專家。人事上能本此方針做去，不愁廉潔政治不能建立。</p>
<p>財政上的調整，是在堵塞一切貪汚的漏洞。統一稅收，剔除中飽，增裕縣政收入，建立獨立的會計制度，統收統支，杜巧絕立名目，苛稅勒索擾嗨民生等事。另一方面，縣政人員的生活有了保障，則他們不敢爲非作惡，以干法紀。外圍縣政一淸明，失去政治愈見淸明。人事財政上有了健全的調整，治安方面的調整，也易於着手。最緊要的是做到能保障縣民的安全，有鎭壓匪賊滋擾的力量，成爲市區的藩籬。如何能够，至低限度，維持治安的武裝力量的餉縉，必須充足，嚴禁擾民勒索之事。同時施以嚴格的訓練，一且有事，皆可勇敢聽命，不致變爲擾民之師，糜爛地方。</p>

<h3>英美軍人槍　渝方志願兵</h3>
<p>（中央社滬訊）據可靠方面消息：重慶軍事委員會去年組織志願兵派遣至緬甸，印度各處，編入英美軍隊服務，担任連絡地方及翻譯工作。查此項志願兵，均自各大學抽調而來，凡大學生服役軍隊滿一學期者（即半年）作爲一學年（一年）學分計算，凡四年級，畢業生則規定服役軍隊半年，始得領取比亞文憑，故去年抽調志願兵總額有一萬五千名。最近此項志願兵，因不堪英美軍人之壓迫，常於行動及言論中表示不合作，而英美軍人則秘密採取斷然卑劣手段，加以槍殺，並毀滅其屍體，近一二月來，重慶已有所聞，然尙未能盡知底蘊。至去年十二月初，槍殺志願兵案件已成爲公開之秘密，即英美駐渝負責人員，亦發表歪曲之半承認之辭，重慶人心激昂，尤以靑年學生爲最。</p>

<p>羅兼局長　整頓稅收</p>
<p>上海市財政局兼局長羅君强自接任後，人事方面除一部份自動辭職外，各科職員均朱更動，以資熟手，現對於財政已着手積極整頓，決以財政統收統支，務求收支平衡爲原則，蓋鑒於過去各種稅收雖稱不少，但支出浩繁，稅收與支出相差百分之六十之鉅，其中難免徵稅人員不力，或不法商民引誘在職公務人員，受賄凟職，企圖中飽或漏稅，此種情形，影響國庫收入重大，故決心以廉潔政策，整頓各種捐稅，督屬厲行催徵，涓滴歸公，不獨確定正當稅源，同時竭力節流支出，以達到收支平衛之目的。</p>
<p>决心解决物價問題</p>
<p>本市物價問題，自周市長羅秘書長視事後，已呈逐漸回跌現象，此實爲全市市民所慶幸。良以物價問題，雖與物資來源通暢與吾，關係至切，然種種人爲事實，造成物價高漲，實屬最大因果。現當局巳決心肅淸不法勒索，則今後物資移入市區，自可圓滑，深盼當局對於物價暴騰之人爲癥結，諸如投機囤積，操縱抬價等等，進一步予以澈底澄淸，斷然採取嚴厲措施，則物價問題可吿解決，一般民生方能安定。</p>

<h3>渝共意見紛歧　敵美乘機而入　松平部長發表談話</h3>
<p>盟邦日本大使館上海事務所昨日下午循例舉行報道會議，松平報道部長發表談話如下：最近美國戰時情報局發表重慶政權方面之報吿書，全文頗爲冗長，綜其要點可分爲三章：（一）渝方政治及抗戰情形，（二）國共交涉之經過及關於各黨各派之問題，（三）渝方經濟情形及美國協助情形。其中關於第二章國共交涉之經過渝方本不予發表，故尤饒興味。據云國共雙方意見分歧之處有三點：（一）渝方允許予陜甘寗邊區政府，於通貨發行權外一切政治權，惟延安方面所要求之地區，除邊區外，華北方面亦須劉入。（二）渝允於實施憲政後，予各黨各派以同等地位，共黨方面則要求立刻實現憲政，並參加聯合政府。（三）渝方內定共軍十師，歸軍委會指揮，與國軍同一待遇。共黨方面則要求擴編十六師。渝方所不予發表者，尙有其他部份，美情報局之報吿，何以竟暴露無餘，其用意頗堪注目。要之，此舉對渝方不無含有贊揚及鼓勵之意味，同時並督促渝方反省，俾取法美國式之民主主義，俾使美國在重慶之活動，更爲便利。</p>

<h3>Fierce Fighting in the Lingayen Coast Area: Japanese Elite Troops Valiantly Battle, Killing 6,000 Enemies and Seizing a Large Number of Spoils</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) – The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 3 PM on the 22nd: (1) The main force of enemy troops that landed along the Lingayen coast has continuously attacked the Japanese first-line positions near Damortis and Cabaruan. A portion of the enemy troops infiltrated the area near Pozorrubio, between the Japanese first and second-line positions. Local Japanese troops fought bravely and continuously destroyed the enemy's attacks. (2) Since the enemy's landing, the main results of the Japanese army's land battles in this area, as determined by the 19th, are as follows: over 6,000 enemy personnel killed or wounded, 59 enemy cannons captured or destroyed, 67 tanks, 26 vehicles, 42 tents, and a large number of other weapons, ammunition, and supplies.</p>
<p>Lingayen Front, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) – The enemy forces in Luzon are attempting to advance towards the Luzon Plain with mobile units, moving south along the Manila Highway for several days, but their attempt has been thwarted by the Japanese army. The Japanese army also landed in the enemy's rear from the bay, using commando units to block their advance, thus the enemy's progress is extremely slow. Although some of their tank-equipped units have moved south to certain locations, their main force remains stalled in the Lingayen coastal area. On the 19th, a portion of the enemy's main force approached the Japanese base northeast of Biti, and was repelled by a fierce Japanese counterattack. Two enemy battalions carrying four mortars in the Damortis-La Union area launched a slow bombardment from the coast, which ceased after a fierce Japanese attack. The American troops who infiltrated 4 kilometers east of La Union are currently being mopped up by the Japanese army. An enemy battalion, led by several tanks, attempted a flanking attack to infiltrate Pozorrubio (15 kilometers east of San Fabian), but was fiercely attacked by Japanese elite troops, killing or wounding eight of them before being repelled. The enemy's heavy artillery, which had been firing wildly since landing, has been silenced by the active daytime and nighttime efforts of Japanese commando and flamethrower units. However, the enemy's resources and will to fight have not diminished. Although the main forces of the two armies have not yet made contact, the situation is extremely tense.</p>
<h3>Heavily Damaged Four Enemy Warships off the Coast of Taiwan: Japanese Kamikaze Units Demonstrate Special Attack Spirit</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) – Since the 3rd, the enemy forces on the Luzon battlefront have once again deployed powerful mobile units in the Bashi Channel and the South China Sea, using their carrier-based aircraft to repeatedly attack Taiwan, Okinawa, and various parts of South China. On the 21st, 450 carrier-based aircraft repeatedly attacked the Taiwan and Okinawa areas. On that day, Japanese Kamikaze special attack units, divided into two groups and escorted by direct support fighters, launched a determined and accurate attack on this enemy mobile unit, severely damaging three enemy aircraft carriers and one warship of unknown type, causing major fires. The Japanese special attack units demonstrated a great special attack spirit by attacking one ship with each aircraft. In the afternoon of the 21st, one group of Japanese Kamikaze special attack units surrounded a group of enemy mobile units in the waters several miles east of Taiwan and immediately launched a fierce attack on them. One Japanese aircraft immediately hit a large enemy aircraft carrier, causing a major fire. Another aircraft hit the bow of a large enemy aircraft carrier, seriously damaging it. Another group of Japanese special attack units also surrounded a group of enemy mobile units near the coast of Taiwan. After a fierce aerial battle with enemy escort fighters, they broke through and attacked the enemy ships, with one aircraft hitting an enemy aircraft carrier and another aircraft hitting an enemy warship of unknown type, causing them to catch fire respectively. These results have been confirmed by Japanese direct support aircraft. Furthermore, the enemy aircraft carriers that caught fire after being attacked by Japanese aircraft were subjected to fierce attacks by the Japanese special attack units. The so-called "heavily damaged and catching fire" is practically equivalent to being sunk, and the damage is very extensive.</p>
<h3>59 Enemy Aircraft Destroyed Attacking Taiwan</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to a telephone report from Taipei, the Taiwan Army announced at 5 PM on the 21st: From around 8 AM to 5 PM on the 21st, a total of 450 enemy carrier-based aircraft attacked the island and Okinawa Island. Fighting is currently underway. The enemy aircraft mainly dropped bombs outside the airfields and strafed and bombed several cities and villages. The damage to Japanese airfields and other facilities is minor. So far, the confirmed results of the battle are: 38 enemy aircraft shot down and 21 destroyed.</p>
<h3>Japanese House of Representatives Held Plenary Session Yesterday: Finance Minister Ishiwata Explains Wartime Finances</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) – The Japanese House of Representatives held a plenary session at 10:30 AM on the 22nd to discuss important bills: the Public Bond Act for supplementing the fiscal resources for the general accounting expenditures of the Showa 20th year, and the Foreign Capital Bank Act. Eighteen committee members thoroughly discussed the bills based on the explanation of the reasons for the proposal by Finance Minister Ishiwata. Finally, each committee member delivered eulogies in memory of the achievements of the deceased Diet members. The session adjourned satisfactorily at 11:57 AM.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) – The main points of Finance Minister Ishiwata's financial address at the House of Representatives meeting held on the 21st are as follows: The total budget for the Showa 20th year, both revenue and expenditure, is over 22.4 billion yen. The focus of the policies is on strengthening war power and securing food supplies. Efforts will be made to increase the expenses for items that are particularly important for completing the operations. In order to adapt to the changes in the war situation and ensure budget flexibility, the national treasury reserve fund will be increased. The first reserve fund is 200 million yen, and the second reserve fund is 2 billion yen. In this way, the wartime budget has been completed without regrets. Since the outbreak of the China Incident, the total amount of public bonds issued is over 84.97 billion yen, the amount sold is over 76.79 billion yen, and the amount sold is over 25.01 billion yen. Therefore, there are no obstacles in using public bonds as a source of funds for war expenses and in the execution of the budget, and the sales of public bonds are trending smoothly. The target amount for increasing national savings is 41 billion yen. In terms of actual performance, bank savings in the first half of the lower fiscal year are approximately 15.4 billion yen, postal savings are approximately 7.9 billion yen, and the increase in the total of other various savings has reached 34.5 billion yen. Regarding economic countermeasures in the event of air raids, a wartime emergency financial countermeasure has already been established. Furthermore, a wartime special damage insurance system has been created, and efforts have been made to reduce tax burdens and other measures, which have been gradually improved and strengthened. These systems are gradually becoming thorough and are having a considerable effect on stabilizing people's livelihood in emergency situations. Secondly, immense financial and economic assistance has been provided to various countries and ethnic groups within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and their economic development has been assisted. This has long been known to the people of the country. Even under severe war conditions, we will overcome all difficulties and spare no effort to provide full support in the future, and devote more efforts to building the Greater East Asia economy.</p>
<h3>Japan Will Implement New Economic Policies Towards China: Mr. Shigemitsu Answers Questions from Diet Members</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) – Japanese Diet member Mr. Kanezaki Tsuneo raised questions to Foreign Minister Shigemitsu on the 21st regarding China policy. He replied that the maintenance of good neighborly relations and friendly ties are paramount, and that new economic policies are under consideration to improve the impoverished economy of China. Foreign Minister Shigemitsu strongly stated that, based on the five principles of diplomacy, actively cooperating in the realization of Sino-Japanese cooperation is essential. To achieve this, it is necessary to first firmly establish good neighborly and friendly relations, completely expel the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States from China, and jointly strive for the comprehensive peace of China based on equality and mutual benefit. Regarding the solution of the urgent economic problems in China at present, the economic policy towards China will be improved in cooperation with China. Although Foreign Minister Shigemitsu did not provide concrete explanations for this new economic policy, it is worthy of anticipation given his active sincerity.</p>
<h3>Japan's War Aim: To Establish Lasting Peace: Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Clarifies Diplomatic Policy</h3>
<p>Close cooperation to Revitalize East Asia: The defense of the Philippines has become the focal point of the defense of East Asia. Therefore, after the United States initiated the invasion, the Philippines immediately and resolutely declared war on the United States. Under the guidance of President Laurel, it is fighting bravely alongside the Japanese army, which has attracted worldwide attention. Another war to defend East Asia is Burma. Since Burma's independence, which occurred a year and a half ago, under the outstanding leadership of Mr. Ba Maw, the country has stood on the front line of the battle to liberate Asia, and continues to struggle, which is truly encouraging for the people of East Asia. The liberation of India is the key to the liberation of Asia and the focus of upholding world justice. Informed people have long recognized this. Chairman Bose leads the Free Indian Army to make the greatest efforts to liberate India. Although it is expected that there will be some difficulties ahead, it is firmly believed that it will eventually complete this great achievement. Thailand, as an ally of Japan, has formed a new cabinet and is cooperating with Japan, making the greatest efforts for the great cause of revitalizing East Asia, which is truly exciting. What constitutes the main background of Japan's war power is Manchuria. Manchuria and Japan are of one heart and one mind, and have consolidated their alliance in both material and spiritual aspects, being in a complete cooperative relationship. Its contribution to Japan's war power is extremely significant.</p>
<p>Policy towards China: Equality and Mutual Benefit</p>
<p>The late Mr. Wang, the great pioneer of East Asia in the Republic of China, passed away in the midst of the realization of comprehensive peace, which was a great loss not only in China but also in East Asia. The Japanese government deeply regrets this. However, although Mr. Wang is dead, his spirit still lives on. The National Government, now under the guidance of Mr. Chen Gongbo, inherits the legacy of the late Mr. Wang and the teachings of the founding father of the country, united in the spirit of shared life and death, and dedicated to Sino-Japanese cooperation. Japan's policy towards China, since the implementation of the so-called new policies, has been unwavering. In the future, it will continue to implement this established policy in political and economic aspects, overcoming all difficulties thoroughly. I would like to take this opportunity to briefly address the international issues centered on China. British policy is to make Asians fight each other in order to reap the benefits, and the United States has inherited this. This has been clearly revealed. They know very well that Japan</p>
<p>Realizing Peace and Completely Withdrawing Troops: Their policy is a major enemy of destroying East Asian stability. This destructive policy is ultimately incompatible with Japan's construction policy. The aim of Japan's policy towards China is to build a new China based on a mutually beneficial relationship. China and Japan have previously agreed to return China to the hands of the Chinese people. What we hope for is to contribute to the great cause of mutually assisting in the revitalization of East Asia. Today, thanks to the advance of the Japanese army, the north-south routes have been opened, and US military bases have been dealt a major blow. Strategically and tactically, completely consistent results have been achieved, which is truly commendable.</p>
<p>Japan's War Aim: To Establish Lasting Peace: Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Clarifies Diplomatic Policy (End)</p>
<p>At the end cannot be subdued, so they have always used China for their own benefit, in order to achieve their unrealistic ambitions, making China and Japan fight each other, and using sweet words and power to drive China to the anti-Japanese front. They sacrifice China and transfer their own burden of war against Japan, attempting to fulfill their monopolistic and exclusive ambitions on the mainland.</p>
<p>When national peace is realized, Japan will completely withdraw its troops from China. The Greater East Asia War arose from Sino-Japanese issues and should return to Sino-Japanese issues. Only after China returns to normal can East Asian stability be ensured. Japan is now advancing its troops into South China in order to strike at the American army and expel the disruptive forces of the United States from China.</p>
<p>Japanese-Soviet Friendship Remains Unchanged: Japan's relations with neutral countries, except those under British and American influence, continue to maintain friendly relations despite the difficulties of wartime, which is no different from the past. In particular, Sweden, Switzerland, and Spain have been acting as proxies for Japan's interests in enemy countries for a long time, protecting Japanese residents, for which Japan expresses its deep gratitude. Furthermore, the relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union is based on the Neutrality Treaty. The two governments, in light of the current position of Japan and the Soviet Union in the world political situation, maintain close contact. The implementation of the transfer of rights agreement concluded and announced last March, and the exercise of fishing rights in accordance with the Fisheries Treaty, are progressing smoothly. However, lasting world peace cannot be achieved by the military policies of Britain and the United States. World peace can only be achieved through the amity and cooperation between all countries. The spirit of the Greater East Asia Declaration lies in this.</p>
<p>Reiterating the Five Major Principles of Diplomacy: The five major principles of Japanese diplomacy that I declared in the Japanese Parliament are also concrete national policies based on this: First, international relations should be based on equality and mutual benefit, to fully develop good neighborly and friendly relations, to open up a new world of mutual affection between all ethnic groups and countries, and to lay the foundation for lasting peace. Second, respect the policy of nationalism, so that each ethnic group and each country can get what it deserves. Third, in accordance with the principle of non-interference in internal affairs, regardless of the size of the country, its sovereignty and independence should be mutually respected. The form of its rule and guiding ideology are internal affairs of each country, and other countries should not interfere. Fourth, in the field of economy, take cooperation as the aim, realize the principle of mutual benefit, and promote the free development of commerce and transportation, and the mutual release of resources. Fifth, promote international cultural exchange to contribute to world peace and progress.</p>
<p>The Army of Justice Will Eventually Win: In short, Japan's claim is to build a world that does not threaten or invade. The essence of Japan's policy is to take all means to make the countries of the world fully understand. However, Japan's just policy will surely be praised by all countries. The purpose of Japan's war is deeply believed to be recognized by the world, and the war of justice will surely win. This is why we are full of confidence in victory.</p>

On the 19th, they occupied Hengli (30 kilometers northeast of Huizhou). The main force of the Yujun Independent Second Division collapsed towards Heyuan (70 kilometers northeast of Huizhou).

<h3>Adjustment Needed for the Seven Counties Under Shanghai's Jurisdiction</h3>
<p>The seven counties under Shanghai's jurisdiction – Nanhui, Chuansha, Chongming, Fengxian, Baoshan, Jiading, and Shenjiang – are as closely related to Shanghai as lips are to teeth. Geographically, these seven counties are located on the periphery, protecting Shanghai. From the perspective of the source of Shanghai citizens' living materials, these seven counties are the lifeline of Shanghai citizens. In terms of public security, these seven counties are close to Shanghai. Any public security problem in any county is enough to affect Shanghai's public security. These seven counties occupy such an important position. Now that Shanghai's municipal administration is trying to get on track, in addition to improving Shanghai itself, it is also necessary to focus on political adjustments in the surrounding counties to bring them in line with Shanghai's municipal administration. Bringing them onto the right track is essential to prevent neglect from affecting the implementation of Shanghai's sound municipal policies. This is what is meant by taking care of the overall situation, focusing on the big picture, and starting with the small things.</p>
<p>Shanghai is the most important metropolis in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Its every move can affect the whole country. Although the enemy planes' several attacks are a psychological warfare tactic, when the war enters a more urgent stage, why wouldn't the American and other enemies have the delusion of military disruption, even if there are complete plans to turn the enemy's dreams into bubbles? However, we must make more precise and detailed preparations. It is better to be prepared and not use it, than to allow the enemy to succeed in any way. This responsibility rests on the shoulders of the newly appointed municipal leaders. Due to the urgency of the situation, it has become one of the important tasks in the renewal of municipal administration. This task requires not only planning for the security of Shanghai itself, but also ensuring that the seven surrounding counties are equally secure. Only then can Shanghai's security have a foundation. At the critical moment of the final battle, they truly assume the mission of the rear base, and work together to win the victory at the front. To plan and build Shanghai's municipal administration from this point of view, we must focus on the seven counties under the city's jurisdiction, integrate them with the municipal administration, and start to adjust and consolidate the periphery. This is the first point.</p>
<p>Stabilizing people's livelihood is the first goal of the newly appointed municipal leader to renew the municipal administration. The main idea in Mayor Zhou's letter to the citizens is to reduce the suffering of citizens. The fundamental spirit of the three points raised by Secretary-General Luo in his inaugural speech is to ensure that the reduction of suffering is effectively achieved. In simple terms, it is to stabilize people's livelihood. Judging from the current situation, commodity prices are showing a stable trend. If given time, rectifying discipline, and implementing honest politics, when considerable results are achieved, people's livelihood can be more stable. Furthermore, if it can be combined with a planned increase in production, the stability of people's livelihood will be even more guaranteed. However, we are mindful of the ancient saying of "failing for lack of one basketful," and cannot but have far-sighted planning. There are many reasons why Shanghai's people's livelihood is so serious. They are already well-known political common sense. The authorities have long understood the cause of the disease, prepared the medicine, and are prescribing the right medicine, so we don't need to nag anymore. However, we must remind that in the past, the instability of people's livelihood was indeed the responsibility of Shanghai's politics, but the policy of the neighboring counties to benefit themselves at the expense of their neighbors was not without influence. For example, the materials needed by Shanghai citizens are all obtained from the surrounding countryside. When transportation is not smooth, reliance on the supply of the affiliated counties must be heavy. The county administration facilities of these counties, each acting on their own, engaging in corruption and extortion, and increasing commodity prices, directly affect Shanghai's municipal administration and the stability of people's livelihood. At the same time, it is also necessary to adjust the county administration of the seven counties under the city's jurisdiction, stabilize people's livelihood, and strive to increase production. This is the second point.</p>
<p>The issue of public security is as important as the stability of people's livelihood. Shanghai's public security is threatened by bandits and fugitives who use the counties with relatively complete police and Baojia (self-policing) organizations as nests to spy on Shanghai and seize opportunities to act. Therefore, to establish Shanghai's public security, we cannot only focus on Shanghai itself, but must also establish the public security of neighboring counties. In that case, it is bound to adjust the county administration of the seven counties under the city's jurisdiction. This is the third point.</p>
<p>Based on the above three points, we feel that the urban area of Shanghai is very important, and the surrounding counties are also very important. It is necessary to start adjusting them at the same time as Shanghai's municipal administration. Otherwise, it will not be perfect. As for how to adjust, we feel that we should start from three aspects: personnel, finance, and public security.</p>
<p>In terms of personnel adjustment, the first thing to do is to replace officials who aim to "get rich." Those with bad records should not only be replaced, but also be punished according to the severity of the circumstances. Generally, officials who are law-abiding, fair, and upright, even if their abilities are slightly lacking, should be rewarded to cultivate a clean and honest atmosphere in the officialdom. This is what is meant by punishing the past to prevent future mistakes. Secondly, the principle of establishing expert politics should be followed. It is impossible for those in power to establish good political achievements with the mentality of "five days as the mayor of the capital." The upper-level leaders should be able to bury themselves in hard work and lead by example, hoping that the middle and lower-level leaders can do things in the spirit of hard work, practical work, and tough work, without perfunctoriness, without following old habits, without being content with the status quo, without complaining about hard work, and without being bureaucratic. The first thing is to make them feel secure in their positions and willing to bury themselves in hard work. In this way, they can give full play to their expertise, and at the same time, it is possible to cultivate non-specialists into good experts. If personnel can be managed according to this policy, there is no need to worry about not being able to establish honest politics.</p>
<p>The financial adjustment is to block all loopholes for corruption, unify tax collection, eliminate embezzlement, increase county revenue, establish an independent accounting system, unify revenue and expenditure, eliminate clever tricks and establish new items, and eliminate harsh taxes and extortion that disturb people's livelihood. On the other hand, with the life of county officials guaranteed, they will not dare to do evil and violate the law. Once the surrounding county administration is clean and clear, the more political will become clean and clear. With a sound adjustment in personnel and finance, the adjustment in public security will also be easier to start. The most important thing is to ensure the safety of county residents and have the power to suppress bandits and disturbances, becoming a barrier to the urban area. How can this be achieved? At a minimum, the military salary and allowance for maintaining public security must be sufficient, and extortion and disturbance of the people must be strictly prohibited. At the same time, strict training should be given, so that in case of an event, everyone can bravely obey orders and will not turn into a master of disturbing the people and wasting resources.</p>

<h3>British and American Soldiers Shoot Chongqing Volunteer Soldiers</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency Shanghai News) According to reliable sources: The Chongqing Military Commission organized volunteer soldiers last year to be sent to Burma, India and other places to be incorporated into the British and American troops, serving as liaison and translation work. It is found that these volunteer soldiers are all drawn from universities. Any university student who serves in the army for one semester (ie, half a year) is counted as one academic year (one year) of credits. All graduating seniors are required to serve in the army for half a year before they can receive a diploma. Therefore, the total number of volunteer soldiers drawn last year was 15,000. Recently, these volunteer soldiers, because they could not bear the oppression of the British and American soldiers, often expressed non-cooperation in their actions and speeches, and the British and American soldiers secretly took resolute and despicable measures to shoot them and destroy their bodies. In the past month or two, Chongqing has heard about this, but it has not been able to fully understand the details. By the beginning of December last year, the case of shooting volunteer soldiers had become an open secret, and even the British and American personnel responsible in Chongqing had issued distorted semi-admissions. The people of Chongqing were excited, especially the young students.</p>

<h3>Fierce Battles Underway on the German-Polish Border, Soviet Troops on the Northern Route Advance to Königsberg</h3>

<h3>Mayor Zhou is Scheduled to Summon Economic and Financial Officials Today to Inquire About Relevant Administrative Policies and Give Instructions</h3>
<p>Mayor Zhou of this city is scheduled to convene senior officials from the Economic Bureau and the Finance Bureau today to give instructions, to inquire about relevant administrative policies and give instructions. On the Economic Bureau side, Director Xu Jiang will lead the team to see and listen to the instructions. On the Finance Bureau side, in addition to the concurrent Director Luo, Advisor Watanabe, Counselor Funatsu, Chief Secretary Xu Songping, and Municipal Government Secretary Liu Mingji will all be present.</p>
<p>Concurrent Director Luo Rectifies Tax Revenue</p>
<p>Since Luo Junqiang, the concurrent Director of the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau, took office, except for a portion who resigned voluntarily, the staff of each section has not changed, in order to be familiar with the work. He is now actively rectifying the finances, and is determined to take the principle of unified revenue and expenditure to achieve a balance between revenue and expenditure. It is because he is aware that although the various tax revenues in the past are said to be not small, the expenditures are huge. The difference between tax revenue and expenditure is as high as 60%. Inevitably, the tax collectors are not effective, or unscrupulous merchants induce on-the-job civil servants to accept bribes and dereliction of duty, attempting to embezzle or evade taxes. This situation has a significant impact on the national treasury revenue, so he is determined to rectify various taxes with a policy of integrity, urging subordinates to vigorously urge collection, and all proceeds will be turned over to the public. Not only will the proper tax sources be determined, but also efforts will be made to reduce expenditure to achieve the goal of balancing revenue and expenditure.</p>
<p>Determined to Solve the Price Problem</p>
<p>Since Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo took office, the price problem in this city has gradually shown a downward trend, which is indeed fortunate for all the citizens of the city. The price problem, although closely related to the smooth flow of material sources, is in fact the greatest cause of high prices caused by various man-made facts. The authorities have now decided to eliminate illegal extortion, and the transfer of materials into the urban area will naturally be smooth in the future. It is hoped that the authorities will further thoroughly clarify the man-made causes of soaring prices, such as speculation, hoarding, and manipulation, and decisively take strict measures, so that the price problem can be resolved and the general people's livelihood can be stabilized.</p>

<h3>Chongqing and Communists Have Different Opinions, American and Other Enemies Take the Opportunity to Enter, Minister Matsudaira Makes a Speech</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Office of the Allied Japanese Embassy held a routine press conference yesterday afternoon. Minister Matsudaira made the following remarks: Recently, the US Wartime Information Bureau published a report on the Chongqing regime. The full text is quite lengthy. The main points can be divided into three chapters: (1) the political and anti-Japanese situation in Chongqing, (2) the process of negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and issues concerning various parties and factions, and (3) the economic situation in Chongqing and the situation of US assistance. Among them, the second chapter on the negotiation process between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party was not to be published by the Chongqing side, so it is especially interesting. It is said that there are three differences of opinion between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party: (1) Chongqing allows the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region government all political powers except the currency issuing power, but the area required by the Yan'an side must also include North China in addition to the Border Region. (2) Chongqing promises to give all parties and factions equal status after the implementation of constitutional government, while the Communist Party requires immediate implementation of constitutional government and participation in the coalition government. (3) Chongqing has internally decided that the ten divisions of the Communist army will be under the command of the Military Commission and will be treated the same as the National Army. The Communist Party requires the expansion of sixteen divisions. There are other parts that Chongqing has not published, but why is the US Intelligence Bureau exposing everything? Its intention is quite noteworthy. In short, this move is not without a meaning of praise and encouragement to Chongqing, and at the same time, it urges Chongqing to reflect, so as to learn from the American style of democracy, so that the activities of the United States in Chongqing will be more convenient.</p>
<h3>Mizuno, a Member of the Rice Promotion Team, Died in Wuxi, Chinese and Japanese Parties Express Grief</h3>
<p>At this decisive stage of the Greater East Asia War, increasing the production and purchasing of rice in the rear has become the most important decisive resource. The Allied Trade Industry Jueqi Team in this city, facing the serious rice problem today, has organized a Rice Promotion Team to go to various rice-producing areas for the second time to work hard to purchase rice, and it is expected that the predetermined goal can be completed by the Lunar New Year. Unexpectedly, recently, Mizuno Sagi (28 years old, an employee of Hengda Foreign Company on Renji Road in this city), a member of the Promotion Team, was surrounded by about 200 Chongqing "Loyal and Patriotic Salvation Army" soldiers while carrying out purchasing work near Zhangxi Town, the third district of Wuxi, on the 18th of this month. Although Mizuno fought bravely, he was outnumbered and died heroically. After hearing the news, Chinese and Japanese parties in this city expressed their deep grief, and due to the spirit of such heroic sacrifice of the Allies, it has aroused the sympathy of Chinese people, and they will give full and active cooperation to the rice purchasing issue in the future as a reward.</p>

<h3>Old Armbands of the Self-Defense Corps Will be Disabled from Next Month</h3>
<p>In the past, the old armbands worn by Baojia and self-defense personnel were all prepared separately, without any connection, which easily caused malpractices.

<h3>The End of the Aid Period is Near; Central Reserve Bank Adjusts Finances; New Loan Requests are Rejected</h3>
<p>With the end of the year rapidly approaching, businesses in this city are rushing to finalize their inter-industry accounts. All debts owed to others must be settled before February 12th. Therefore, businesses are sending people with bills to collect old debts. Currently, all transactions are conducted with cash sales only, and credit has been temporarily suspended. Banks and money shops are also collecting from their clients. Except for trusted clients with good credit, loan extensions are carefully tightened, and new loan requests are rejected. As a result, the money market in the city has become quite tight recently. However, the Central Reserve Bank and the Silver and Money Industry Clearing House are committed to adjusting funds as much as possible to meet the legitimate needs of the industry.</p>

<h3>Ping Pong Friendship Match: Zheng Xing Wins Over Zhe Xing</h3>
<p>The Zheng Xing women's table tennis team responded to the invitation of the Zhejiang Yiye Bank table tennis team yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM and held a friendly match in the Zheng Xing Girls' Middle School gymnasium at 162 Luoyang Road. The former are the top-notch female table tennis players in this city, and the latter are well-known in the banking industry. There were many spectators, and the atmosphere was enthusiastic. Chen Linsheng and Lin Zhishou served as referees and recorders. In the five singles matches, Zhe Xing team had many veteran table tennis players, but due to their daily work, they neglected practice, resulting in their skills not being refined. As a result, Zhe Xing narrowly lost to the Zheng Xing team 2-3, which was a pity. Finally, there was a doubles exhibition match, which was extraordinarily wonderful. It is noted that this was the first time the Zheng Xing team was formed, and the team members' good fighting spirit and strict adherence to team discipline were even more commendable. The full results of yesterday's match are as follows: (Zheng Xing Team) (Zhe Xing Team) Tao Lanying 0-2 Sun Bin, Lin Jinlan 2-0 Wang Ligen, Zhou Ruihua 2-1 Feng Qihong, Xiao Weiqing 2-2 Peng Wangqin, Xu Ruilan 2-1 Wang Xugang.</p>
