<h3>日軍有力挺進隊　突擊敵方砲兵陣　阿古諾河一帶戰鬥漸激烈</h3>
<p>東京十九日中央社電　日大本營十九日下午三時發表：仁牙因方面其後戰况如次：（一）仁牙因及達古旁方而，敵軍概已進出於阿古諾河一帶，聖法比安方面敵軍，槪已進出於海岸四公里之綫上，其一部已侵入日軍第一綫之陣地內，戰鬥逐次激烈。（二）日軍有力挺進部隊，於一月十六日夜已突入聖法此安附近之敵陣，收獲大戰果，該挺進隊之突擊該方面移動中之敵砲兵，至十八日晨仍未開始射擊。</p>
<p>馬尼刺十九日中央社電敵　軍此次於呂宋島，曾企圖實現攻佔馬尼刺，然其畏懼向馬尼刺正面進攻，必遭日軍之準備邀擊，而大流血，故敵軍目下雖未在馬尼刺灣登陸，然今後可以預期，且更可警戒其傘兵降陸之必要，日軍對此，必能發揮得意之戰術，至於馬尼剌之日軍將士，正準備決戰之光臨。</p>
<p>日軍精銳嚴陣以待</p>
<p>東京十九日中央社電　此間朝日　聞，頃就菲律賓美軍之兵力及其損失述稱，敵軍爲逐行菲律賓作戰，現正結合强大兵力，計雷伊泰島七島，明多羅一鳥，仁牙因灣四島。今呂宋島爲開戰以來所遭遇之敵最大陸地兵力。然雷伊泰方面由於日軍特攻隊及陸地部之英勇奮戰，敵損失慘重，據上月二十五日麥克沃塞司令部發表，陣亡負傷行踪不明者合計一萬一千二百十七名，時經月餘，敵軍之損失諒已達數萬之衆，同時，呂宋島方面，日軍精銳嚴陣以待，美軍若再度來犯，必將有更大之犧性。</p>
<p>仁牙因灣敵軍恐懼昌攻奇襲</p>
<p>呂宋島前綫基地十九日中央社電敵軍在仁牙因灣登陸後，經日軍猛攻，顯然未能前進，目下敵軍最受恐怖者，乃日軍自天空降下之特攻隊及黑夜之突擊隊。敵眾於登陸前，爲阻止日軍特攻隊之壯烈拼撞，雖有大船團之掩護，將運諭船爲裝爲空母，或將士兵分乘小舟挺，盡力分散，以避損失等，其目的爲阻止陸地日軍突擊，在雷伊泰戰綫陣地周邊，加强多數機槍陣，並在前方裝有無數之集音機，此次深知防止日軍突擊隊之困難，更在仁牙因灣使用大批軍犬，配置於陣地周圍，然日方果敢之挺身隊，不以此爲意，述夜繼續猛攻，敵軍亡命於禦防。</p>
<p>兩次渡比鑫河均被勇猛擊退</p>
<p>菲律賓前綫基地十八日中央社電　據十七日日軍某基地消息稱，十四日薄暮，仁牙因灣方面之戰鬥，以聖法安東方及其東南方之比提　納奧方面爲中心而展開，進比提南方方面，彼此正對時中，十四日敵軍曾二次渡比多河進擊，均被日軍勇猛擊退，並予莫大損害。敵軍並曾侵入呂宋西方四公里之高地，而續演小規模戰鬥，在納奧正面，敵軍主力謀突破日軍陣綫，卒遭日軍擊退。又敵軍艦上之炮擊及轟炸之重點在攻納奧之間，同時日軍亦集重火器，向敵艦船陣地及物資倉庫等處猛烈炮擊之。</p>
<p>港收容所被炸英人死傷多名</p>
<p>香港十九日中央社電　侵入南海之敵機動部隊，十五·六兩日開始攻擊中，窺向葡萄牙領澳門各地，破壞醫院，殺戮平民及第三國民衆，極盡殘暴之心。又空襲香港時，曾以機槍掃射香港敵性國人民收容所，英國人多數死傷，故英國人對美機之濫炸，痛憤異常。緣十六日下午來襲之敵艦載機，因受日方防空砲火猛射，乃對香港收容所投下十五六顆炸彈，收容所房屋被震破壞，內英國人民死亡者有十五名（內男十女五），重傷四名（男二女二），敵機更不斷以機槍掃射，受重傷者數十名（內英人三十名）。按該收容所戰後即由日方於日內瓦國際紅十字會存案，英美按理常知，且該空襲時之天氣又十分晴朗，即由高空識別亦無訛誤，故收容之人對美機之盲炸十分憤慨。前香港英總督府民政長官基姆遜，十七日以收容所代表資格，向日當局擬呈出書信，堅稱，美機之非人道行爲，表示激切憤感，並感謝日當之善後處置。</p>

<h3>日本海軍待機中　生產力順利推進</h3>
<p>東京十九日中央社電　讀賣新聞頃以「日本海軍待機中」爲題，論述如次：美國機動部隊，於空襲台灣地帶後，其前主力自巴士海峽侵入中國南海，十五·十六兩日，再度攻擊台灣。香港。廣東。汕頭及於中國南海航行中之船舶，妨害日軍之補給戰力，圖使菲律賓孤立。日本海軍自去秋十月於台灣空戰與菲律賓海戰後，立即　備態勢，以空軍爲主之近代海軍，待機擊滅敵美之機動部隊，日方生產雖在敵機轟炸下，仍然順利推進，以一億血汗爲後盾之日本海軍戰力，必將毁滅敵軍機動部隊。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>平抑物價第一</h3>
<p>平抑物價的緊迫性，我們早已再三呼籲過，而如何平抑物價，我們也屢屢貢獻過一得之見；可是儘管各方人士怎樣期待，物價終是有漲無跌，祗騰難平。高物價是市民們當前一切痛苦之源，我們已於日前社評中指出，在茲市政長官更替之際，市民第一擠要　香禱祝的事，就是物價的平定，而新市政常局第一件應該用斷然手段處置的事，也正是平抑物價。所以今天我們要大聲的向市政當局喊出：</p>
<p>「平抑物價第一！」</p>
<p>目前物價所以稍稍平靜，是有若干因素的！</p>
<p>第一，所謂大漲小回（其實是大漲小平），是近年來物價於大漲之後所常有的現象。原來物價大漲之後，一方面由於社會購買力突然的減退，及投機操縱者之需要調養一下，往往會有極短促時期的的靜態。另一方面，物價動盪中銀根轉緊，囤勢減弱，無形中遂略趨平穩。同時，受輿論的督責，當局照例有取締鎭壓之類的聲明或談話，這些雖不一定切實有効，但投機操縱者爲迴避風頭，由觀望一下而使物價漲勢稍戢，也是事實。</p>
<p>第二，目前陰曆年關將屆，各業都忙於準　結帳，或養精蓄銳以圖來年，市面由動而靜，是年年例有的現象。且年關迫近，不僅各業銀根奇緊，私人間也都手頭特別拮据，頭寸旣緊，購買旣縮，因此，所謂物價轉疲，自亦成爲必然。在陰曆年終以前，如果沒有什麼過大的剌激，或不會再有狂跳。</p>
<p>以上所述，都是屬於週期性的短時現象，年關一過，高物價浪潮重復襲來，也是可能的。且物價週期性的上漲，終是一次比一次兇猛，又根据往年經騐，陰曆新年初頭的漲勢當比平時更烈，所以不久以後可能重來的高物價浪潮，其可怕程度也許比從前更高。這不是我們危言聳聽，倘使物資來源依然不能疏暢，抑平物價對策依然不够完善，危機確實很深。</p>
<p>怎樣防範物價週期性上漲的危機？以及怎樣進而消滅它？這是市政當局迫切要做的工作。我們始終認爲上海物價的暴漲，除了物資不足，交通不暢等經濟上原因以外，而最大的原因卻是人爲的操縱，試以一年半來的米價爲例，三十二年七月間米價每石一千八百元，至三十三年十二月，漲至每石四萬餘元，相差二十除倍，暴漲的程度實已超過了經濟原因的可能上漲程度。經濟原因的上漲，自須尋求針對的補救之道，而人爲原因的暴漲，自也必須施以針對的壓平手段。所以，上海的物價抑平之道，除極力設法增加生產，疏通物資來源，及改善配給外，允須用嚴厲手段取締囤積居奇，查辦投機操縱，禁絕且商勾結，都是非常必要的。據傳這幾天物價梢平的另一原因，由於一般投機操縱者震於周羅諸長官的威名，及新舊交替間官商相通的脫節，遂不敢繼續肆無忌憚，當然不無關係。觀此，今後當局如能眞正做到鐵面無私，運用斷然手段，予以嚴峻處置，於平抑物價，必能獲致極大的功効。一治亂世用重典」，「殺一儆百」，我們期待市政當局鐵腕的發揮。周市長在吿市民書中所說的「希望」，市民們的希望並不過大，倘使物價能平，生活稍稍能够安定些，可說希望已實現一大半了。</p>
<h3>呂宋島敵軍　陷入苦戰中　鹽田大尉談菲島戰局</h3>
<p>盟邦日本駐華艦隊報道部，循例於十九日下午二時會見本市中日新聞記者，松島部長因公返日，由鹽田大尉代表，介紹新任海軍囑託秋田正雄與記者相見後，即對戰局現勢，作詳細之闡述，談話如下：</p>
<p>呂宋東部敵軍危機</p>
<p>菲律賓島陸上戰鬥，自十六日晚起，戰機業已成熟，現在敵我兩軍，以仁牙因灣作中心，在五十公哩長的戰綫上展開激戰。敵人自東西及中央三路進攻，其主力部隊在中央方面平奈，（Binmneg）該處位仁牙因灣東方約數里之一村落。據敵方報道，西方部隊前進最深，已渡阿格諾河，按阿格諾河係從南方起向東北方向流之蜿折彎曲河流，敵軍究在何處渡河，現尙未悉。同時敵方報道東方部險陷於苦戰，比較起來，西部比東部略有進展。東部以遭日軍猛攻，僅距海岸綫數里，迄尙不能有所進展。根據此點判斷，日方以呂宋島中央平原爲中心，至仁牙因灣東部一帶，以有力機動部隊邀擊敵人，日軍部隊並在聖法比安登陸，敵東方部隊定遭殲滅打擎。敵人自登陸以後作戰旬日，戰局進行極爲遲緩，尤以自十六日起至現在，敵方遭遇嚴重損害，今後作戰當益感困難。敵方恃物量豐富拼命在仁牙因灣投資，日方對敵物資，常即予以覆減，並在明多羅島及蘇魯海，摩伊泰島以奇襲戰術，予以重大打擊。今後敵方作戰，定遭重大犧牲。現在仁牙因灣之敵，其所遭損害，亦爲極爲重大。日方作戰自無在海岸綫決戰之意，必將誘敵至寬廣平原，然後可伸縮自如，使敵有大量部隊誘進，然後可遭大量消耗及重大打擊。</p>
<p>海上決戰日益迫近</p>
<p>軍方面在該方擔任陸軍最高指揮官之山下大將及海軍最高指揮官大川內中將，均爲名將，對作戰方面，定可獲相當戰果。以上　關於陸上戰鬥，至海軍方面最注意者，爲尼米資艦隊及英國太平洋艦隊之動向。過去在台灣及菲律賓海戰中殲滅殆盡之尼米資艦隊，刻又整理起來，以擔任掩護麥克沃塞部隊之任務。敵人在作戰上，對於日本本土至台灣及菲律賓、與中國至菲律賓之補給路綫，企圖施以破壞，過去已常有此種活動，敵人尙有一慾望，即在可能時希望獲一較菲律賓更進一步之基地。不過其最大任務，仍爲破壞補給路綫。最近時在華南轟炸，亦爲破壞補給路綫之證明。日海軍自合灣菲律賓兩海戰後。對於飛機之補充，業經完備，關於下次大海戰之準備，亦已完成。對於尼米資艦隊之將採如何活動，及如何對付，爲當前最注意之課題。美海軍已感覺自已勢力薄弱，故强求英國太平洋艦隊參加作戰，並要求英國印度洋艦隊在蘇門答臘方面佯爲作戰，以資牽制，海上決戰時期已日見成熟，不久將來，日方獲最後勝利，已操左券，尼米資部隊欲到中國來之夢想，已漸漸成爲不可能的狀能。今後在中國東南海岸上敵潛艇及飛機之活動，或不可避勉，但對於決戰，毫無影響。</p>
<p>美對延安將有策動</p>
<p>最近美軍到菲律賓後，將以政治手腕對於以延安爲中心之共黨，有所策動，美國爲政治問題而拉籠共黨，顯然不相信重慶政權，美國報紙對此亦有擴大記載，渝政權希望美軍到中國，但反予中共以擴大地盤之機會，此實渝方矛盾之希望。</p>
<p>敵美生產供不應求</p>
<p>豐田大尉對於美國國內情勢，亦有申述，據稱，美國以人力物力之豐足而誇耀於世，在此次大顧中自負必勝，但終由日軍猛擊、遭受空前損失，陷於絕境。根據十九日美國舊金山及華盛頓合衆社所發電報，足以暴露其國內之情勢。原電如下：「今日於太平洋戰綫，尤以菲律賓作戰中，美國艦隊補給修理補充問題，已入危急狀態，因目下該方面作戰中之美國艦隊，均有修理之必要，美國生產陣中職工不足，乃使亟須修理之艦船多如山積，而新造船之生產，亦復遲緩不進，於將來作戰中，致有重大影響。又因新兵器等之製造，極形忙碌，更須使設備與勞力增加，單視海軍方面，因對日作戰，艦船遭受損失，共數日增，致船隻修理與新造，顯呈供不應求之現象」。根據美方新聞社此種直率之承認，可知美國作戰之困難及其國內情勢之窘急。</p>
<h3>日壽備創設　儲蓄銀行</h3>
<p>東京十八日中央社電　日大藏省及日銀行兩當局，關於合併東京，名古屋，大阪等三都市之人民儲蓄配行問題，創設儲蓄銀行，於十八日上午十時由儲蓄銀行及大藏省關係人員出席商議此事，結果已決定新儲蓄銀行之名稱爲日本儲蓄銀行，至於資本方面及其詳情等，於十八日開協義會時，再行決定。</p>
<h3>德與英瑳　交換戰俘</h3>
<p>康斯坦斯十九日中央社電　海通社訊：德軍重傷戰俘的四千六百人，與英美軍戰俘二千五百人，昨晨在此間由瑞士紅會監督之下實行交換，此外尙有德國平民八百七十五人與同數之北美及南美人交換。</p>
<h3>英軍進駐　薩朗尼加</h3>
<p>里斯本十九日中央社電　據雅典電：希臘愛拉斯團基於前與英軍司令斯柯比間簽訂之休戰協定，於十八日自希臘之第二大都市薩朗尼加撤退，英軍亦於該夜於未受何等抵抗下，向該市及該市周圍三百二十公里之據點進駐完畢。</p>
<h3>捷克前總統　貝奈斯行動</h3>
<p>柏林類爲注意</p>
<p>柏林十九日中央社電　德國社訊，柏林政界人士對于英方消息所稱捷克前總統貝奈斯擬旅行至喀爾巴阡烏克蘭一節，予以特別注意。貝奈斯預料喀爾巴阡烏克蘭將有類似慮布林之發展，故擬躬自前往，以防避捷克國家機構之崩潰，但莫斯科是否將允許渠前往該處，尙須拭目以待。</p>
<h3>美造船競爭　英方極恐懼</h3>
<p>里斯本十九日中央社電　德國社訊，據紐約消息：美海軍少將藍德穴稱，就目下美方造輪程序而言，美國於戰後將擁有輪舶五千萬噸，共總噸數幾等於全世界商輪噸位三分之二，而較美國戰前所有者大四倍，反之，英方之噸位則减少百分之五十。倫敦報紙謂，英方對此種現象，表示驚異，蓋此爲美對全世界擴大輸出之先聲。</p>
<p>日本空軍勇士準備出發殺敵</p>

<h3>日議會明日再開　將審議決戰施策　眾議院預算總會定期舉行</h3>
<p>東京十九日中央社電　上月二十七日暫告休會之日第八十六屆議會，茲已定於本月二十一日起繼續再開，在此休會期間，東亞之戰局更趨苛烈，故政府當局於十二日之閣議席上，曾公布迅速實踐新規定之緊急決戰施策五項，即對於以翼政會爲中心之新國民組織再檢討，且此次再開議會，對於國內決戰體制最後之完成工作，當作極詳之審議。</p>
<p>小磯首相披瀝決意</p>
<p>二十一日再開議會之際，兩院定時各開本會，貴族院定於上午十時開會，首由小磯首相演說施政方針，披瀝政府對於決戰之決意，并要求一億國民發揮特攻精神，屆時政府並詳細解釋所決定之下列各實踐事項：（一）增强防空體制，（二）澈底增强軍需增產，（三）竭力增產食糧並强自給體制，（四）增强勤勞體制及國民勞動動員，（五）澈底使所有物資化爲戰力</p>
<p>重光外相發表演說</p>
<p>在首相演說之後，重光外相特就外交方針發表演說，而闡明明日本在決戰階段之中之戰時外交。下午眾議院全體會議與貴族院相同，惟在首相，外相之施政演說後，則由石渡藏相發表財政施策，其後即由議會役員會長金光庸夫代表質問，本日復豫定開正式之審議，此次之議會，對於議會決戰性之審議，已特加考慮。貴族院方面，對施政方針演說之代表質問亦中止，至特別委員會之構成，亦求簡素。</p>
<p>臨時軍費即將决定</p>
<p>眾議院方面，亦限定審議重點，對於重核之質問，亦設有即時整理之萬全辦法，以期實現重點之集中審議，政府對於應提出於議會之二百二十二億餘元之明年一般會計預算案及明年十九億餘元之增稅案等三十餘件法律案，已行決定，目前特急於決定追加預算案及臨時軍費等案，對此，貴。眾兩院在休會期中，業將政府之提案完全審查，故行將再開之議會，當爲一堪稱爲戰塲議會之短期議會也。</p>
<p>軍需緊急增產方策</p>
<p>又眾議院之預算總會，特定於二十四日前後舉行，屆時對軍需緊急增產方策，將詳加討論。</p>
<h3>日眾議院舉行調查會</h3>
<p>東京十九日中央社電　日眾議院爲準備二十一日再開之第八十六屆議會，特於十八日下午舉行調查會，大藏部會邀請大藏省小童原政務次官及各關係局長出席，說明今年度一般會計預算案，並作種種質問，至四時許散會。十九日自上午十時舉行內閣及各省部會，聽取各當局者說明關於政府提出諸法案，作質疑檢討後，事前審查即告完畢。</p>
<p>翼政會決定强力新黨案</p>
<p>東京十九日中央社電　日本翼政會十八日於本部舉行政務調查會議，出席有松村會長，木村，木曹，村瀨各副會長，以及各職員，於十七日必勝國內體制確立特別委員會決定之「結成强力新黨案」加以檢討，最後通過一俟該案於十九·二十兩日經常務總會及臨時總務會附議後，決定翼政會之正式態度，即將由山林總裁呈知小磯首相。</p>
<h3>强化防空態勢日决定預算　撥廿億元增置各設施</h3>
<p>東京十九日中央社電　日情報局十九日發表：政府關於五大決戰施策中之第一項，强化防空態勢案，曾經考究其具體方案，刻已付諸實施，並決定預算爲二十億元，此次決定施策中之最堪注目者，乃係隧道或防空設施之增置，且該項設施非限於一般待避所，即官廳及重要設施等，亦同樣實施，以昭永久。</p>
<h3>日閣設戰時物價審議會</h3>
<p>東京十九日中央社電　日政府此次爲强化實行物價政策，特於內閣中新設戰時物價審議會，專司審議戰時物價政策之根本對策及運用大綱。十九日閣議內決定，由情報局發表如次：戰時物價審議時，由內閣總理大臣兼任會長，由民間擢選的價問題之權威十名爲委員，戰時物價審議會設置後，凡過去司審定價格任務之中央委員，會同地方委員會，以及物價協議會名稱，決分別加以調整或改廢。</p>
<h3>德政界批評邱吉爾演辭</h3>
<p>柏林十九日中央社電　德國社訊：此間政界人士批評週四邱吉爾於英下院所發表之演說，據謂，邱氏以僞善之態度而頌揚英之「誠實」政策，而同時對美之實力增大表示嫉妒。又謂，「英應於地中海佔領袖地位，實不啻對英之特別着眼於希臘及虐待義大利波諾米政權加以註釋。其對南斯夫所發表之言論，乃等於承認蘇聯之解決辦法爲旣成事實，南王彼得從此必須接受此項辦法，否則將開罪於英。邱氏重申軸心國無條件投降之請」，然全德民眾刻正以「決不」二字作答，敵對德之殲滅決意，已被一堅決爲前途命運而戰之民族所阻擾矣。</p>
<h3>維斯都拉河套德軍主力西移　克拉科展開激烈巷戰</h3>
<p>柏林十九日中央社電　德國社訊，德軍事發言人十八日在新聞記者會議上鄭重聲稱：東綫德軍主力部隊在良好秩序下，由維斯杜拉河套撤退，已予蘇軍坦克編隊以極度重大損失，此等德軍部隊之行動，現正完全照預定計劃進行。發言人答覆記者之詢問稱，迄今僅蘇軍之坦克車先頭部隊抵達洛茲（Loda）東方。在蘇軍攻勢區之南部戰事，已擴及克拉科北部與西北部郊外</p>
<p>柏林十九日中央社電　德國社訊，軍息：克拉科（Cracow）西北部發生激烈巷戰。東普魯士邊區敵軍企圖突破未逞。</p>
<p>德軍放棄捷吐兩城</p>
<p>柏林十九日中央社電　德元首行營十八日正午發表，捷斯托科發（Czestochowa）及吐瑪查夫市（Tomoshov）經激烈之巷戰後，爲蘇軍攻陷。</p>
<p>蘇軍兵力達百餘師</p>
<p>柏林十九日中央社電　海通社訊：蘇軍冬季攻勢之第六日，進展至戰綫迤西，地名皆爲前所未曾提及者。但德軍在蘇軍坦克車先鋒隊後方，仍在孤軍作戰，利用時機樹立堅强之抵抗。目前德軍司令部正在擇取可以遏阻蘇軍進展之據點，待機而戰，故自後方特調集後備軍，以備及時遏阻蘇軍之進展。德軍現正在貝斯基特及米爾之間，力敵蘇軍之猛攻，該處蘇軍兵力有步兵八十五師及大隊坦克車。維斯拉夫迤北蘇軍二十師新銳，在莫林與捷克哈諾夫之間加入作戰，企圖突入德軍陣綫，並未獲逞，蓋德軍先已退出捷克哈諾夫。蘇軍在東普魯士邊境一帶作戰，並無顯著之進展，蘇軍在德省北疆突破之缺口，即爲德後備軍收復，蘇軍同時進犯斯達魯波寗·肯平寗公路，雖兵力雄厚，但在斯達魯波寗迤西十公里之處，即被擊潰。</p>
<p>政治意義極堪重視</p>
<p>柏林十九日中央社電　蘇軍於十二日自布達佩斯方面至東普魯士之側戰後，展開强力之冬季攻勢。現蘇軍結集之兵力武器等，實爲德蘇開戰四年以來稀有者，其意圖一氣直入德本土展開決戰。德軍最高司令部自去年十一月初，即對東部軍發出警告，靜待蘇軍發動冬季攻勢，然時經兩月，蘇軍始漸活動。查其原因，乃由英美兩國對波蘭之處分尙未發表示態度，而蘇聯欲圖獨自處理，但又不願付高價之犧牲，徒有助西綫之反軸心軍，故由此政治見地，遂遲遲開始攻勢。此間靈通人士一致之見解，亦係以爲因英美兩國所企圖之西部攻勢，遭德軍大反攻歸於失敗，而史羅邱三者會談即將舉行，蘇聯爲圖於會議中在政治上佔有利立塲，故今日突然採取攻勢。又據可靠人士觀察，希臘赤色愛拉斯團突與英國系之希臘政府締結休戰協定，基於英國勢力圈下，蘇聯採取此種態度與冬季攻勢及計劃中之三國會議，俱爲政治上一種對策。另一部分士則認爲反軸心軍若東西呼應，雙方發動大攻勢，則德軍勢難抵抗，然德軍乘此間原，突於西綫轉取攻勢，使反軸心軍退守西綫要塞綫之遙遠後，粉碎其攻勢企圖，使之無力進攻。故德軍對此次蘇軍之冬季攻勢，定可裕餘應戰，此乃希特勒元首作戰指導之成功，頗爲軍事專家敬佩。總之，蘇軍展開之冬季攻勢，含有軍事政治種種意義，與整個歐洲戰局影響甚大，頗堪重視。</p>
<h3>波臨時政府遷入華沙</h3>

<h3>渝共談判破裂經過（二）續第八版十四日</h3>
<p>七　張治中王世杰之再答復</p>
<p>三十三年九月十日</p>
<p>二·伯渠先生勛鑒：接展八月三十日來示，藉悉，弟等前函，本平心靜氣之旨，說明中央政府對於中共要求，何者可以容納，何者可以相當容納，何者可留待將來考慮，何者無從容納。弟等之意，在切切實實的商討，以求問題的解決：來示則故爲誇張抺煞之詞，與弟等之期待，完全相反。弟等循誦來示之餘，雅不欲一一辯正，僅略答一二，尙祈惠察。</p>
<p>（一）中央命弟與先生商談，在求全國之眞正統一，換言之，即在求中共切實履行其四項諾言，切實擁護「全國政權統一」，切實服從國民政府軍事委員會之指揮。先生來函謂「八年來這四項諾言我們早已完全實踐了」，又謂「我們共產黨人始終執行四項諾言」。假使中共在過去曾經切實履行各項諾言，何至中共在各地對國軍有如許侵之事實？假使中共現在尙履行各項諾言，中央何至今日尙須命弟先生商談服從軍令政令等等問題？</p>
<p>（二）中央命弟與先生商討統一，原欲爲未來之憲政與夫整個三民主義的實施，樹立强固的基礎。關於如何實現民主政治問題，以及黨派問題等等，中央提示案中旣有凱切條文，弟等八月十日函中復有詳細的申說。來示則謂中央對於中共所提此類要求，「一字未提」，弟等眞不知先生何故爲此不實之言。尤使弟等惶惑者，來示謂「我們在邊區及各根據地澈底實行三民主義」，並謂在中共的一切地區內，「一切人民和團體，均享有一切自由和權利」。假使事實果如，來示所言，弟等惟有感佩。然而許多事實均迫着弟等否認。即如就民主與自由而言，國父遺敎顯然欲以五權分立爲民主的正軌與人民自由的保障。國民政府不敢自謂，對於此點已經完成一切準備，因此不敢以業經「澈底實行了三民主義」自居，中共區域內果有司法權獨立，監察權獨立等等事實乎？中共區域內之人民乃至共產黨員，果有言論自由身體自由等等保障乎？如其未然，則爲切實實行三民主義計，弟等何能照來示所言，轉請中央政府，將中共的「各項民主設施與民主法令」予以「提倡，推行於全國」？弟等前函曾促請中共諸公，對於民主自由等問題，勿提出毫無邊際的抽象的要求，以增加異日之糾紛，而應隨時與中央政府國民參政會以及憲政實施協進等切切實實的商討各項問題的正當解決辦法。接誦來示後，弟等愈覺弟等前函所言，匪惟至當，且屬必要</p>
<p>對於以上兩點，庶幾今後商談不致徒託空言。至於來示中其他抹煞事實之語，弟等早已一一奉答。關於軍隊編制，軍隊調動等問題，弟等前函及口頭業已有所說明，亦覺無再說之必要。惟尙有一點，弟等不能不鄭重聲明；弟等前函謂中央提示案對於去歲林彪師長曁最近先生在西安所提意見，已「大部容納」云云，係絕對眞實之言，無絲毫誇張之意。竊意任何第三者，如將林彪師長所提出四條，曁先生在西安簽字之件，持與本年六月廿五日中央提示案逐條比照，應以第等「大部容納」之言爲眞實。顧先生來示依然强調「距離太遠」之言。倘中央提示案確與中共要求「距離太遠」，其原因究竟何在？一言以蔽之曰；只因中共方面之要求與時俱增也。先生在西安所表示之意見，較去歲林彪師長所提之要求爲多，六月四日中共所提之十二條，又較先生在西安時所提之要求爲多。此次先生來函，又復於十二條之外，加上所謂「口頭八條」。要求旣與時俱增，距離乃不能不遠。譬如陜北邊區，曁所謂「其他根據地」問題，在林彪師長所提之四條中，定爲「陜北邊區照原地區改爲行政區，其他各地區，另行改組，實行中央法令」。先生在西安簽字文件中，並未列入「其他根據地」問題。在六月四日中共所提十二條件中，則要求承認「陜甘寗邊區及華北根據地民選政府。」在先生此次來示中，則更以「陜甘寗邊區政府及華北，華中，華南各根據地民選政府」的承認爲言。在此種逐漸擴大要求的情形之下，倘商談未能接近，試問其責任究在何方？抗戰建國之工作，急待完成。時至今日，我國家民族，仍未能具備抗建成功之最低條件（即全國的統一），中央政府與國民黨同人，誠不能不深自痛快。尊示謂解決國共關係，應把整個國家民族的利益放在第一，而不把一黨一派的利益放在第一，旨哉斯言，弟等深信中央政府與國民黨決不將一黨一派的利益，置於國家民族的利益之上，因此切望中共諸公同守此言，庶幾商談能獲進展，一切問題，可以得到合理的解決。</p>
<p>至於先生邀約弟　　安一行一節，只要於事有益，弟等亦所樂　，但中共是否能派負責代表來重慶解決本問題，並派何人任代表偕返重慶，尙希見示爲荷。專復，並頌時祺！弟張治中王世杰敬啓。九月十日。</p>
<h3>中共代表林祖涵在渝參政會報告詞</h3>
<p>各位先生！國民參政會主席團要我報告國民政府派張文白王雪艇兩先生與中共中央派本人雙方談判的經過，本人對此感到十分興奮。</p>
<p>國共關係應該公平合理的調整，在現政治情况下爲十分緊要的事情；不僅參政會同人注意這一問題，全國人民也十分關切。我今天要報告的就是我們與張王兩先生四個月來談判的過程。在這過程中，大致有七個重要文件，主席團已印發各位，可請參考。</p>
<p>非難渝方缺乏誠意談判四月毫無結果</p>
<p>這次談判，本人從延安出來，抱着滿腔熱誠，希望能夠解決問題，並很高興在西安，與張王兩先生不期而晤。我們的談判是在很友好的情形下進行的，迄今爲止，我們雙方的談判原則上存在着很大的距離，雖然我們的談判尙未最後帝王，但四個月來，還無結果可以報告。</p>
<p>我們所要求於國民黨中央的，第一個是全國實行民主政治的問題，在今天日軍正深入國土，抗戰尙在艱巨時期，必須全國軍民團結一致，必須全國人民都動員起來，日本是一個工業發達的國家，它是有力量的，它正在我國境內作戰，我們必須重視這一嚴重形勢。中國有四萬萬五千萬人民，不過沒有團結起來，沒有充分的發動起來，今天非常迫切需要將這全部力量團結起來，發動起來。用什麼方法來團結全國力量，來發運全國力量呢？我們認爲應該在戰爭中實行民主政治，只有民主政治才能團結全國一切力量，動員全國一切力量，以拯救我們民族國家的災難。我們主張實行三民主義，嚴爭建國綱領，和中共所提出十大綱領，如這三大綱領眞正實行，就能團結全國力量。蔣委員長在戰事初期曾說過：「地無分南北，民無分老幼，無論何人些有守土抗戰之責」我黨中央在戰爭初期就主張實行民主·動員·人民·實現全面全民的抗戰，不應該是政府與軍隊片面戰爭。我們對立即實施民主以增强全國團結作戰力量的意見，戰爭以來是一貫如此主張，這次談判也是這樣提出來的。</p>
<p>中共要求共計三端擴編共軍承認黨政</p>
<p>其次，我們從國共兩黨關係上說，希望解決一些懸案，這些懸案主要是有關軍隊·政權·與黨三方面問題。我們在前綫作戰八年，軍事政治形勢有很多變化。在戰爭初期，當時有八萬紅軍，政府只承認編了三個師，奉命出動，渡河入晋作戰，並得到最高統帥部的命令，要我們組織一些游擊挺進隊，挺進至前方作戰，我們自己看來，幾年來在前方艱困作戰，做得還好。十八集團軍，新四軍在晋·冀·察·熱·綏·遠遼·魯·豫·蘇·皖·浙·鄂·粵等省作戰，建立了許多民選政權，我們經過七年多的作戰，正規軍已增加到四十七萬七千五百人，並組織了民兵二百二十萬人。我們要求政府先給我們五個軍十六個師的番號。同時，在前方已建立了十五個根據地，人民選舉了自己的政府，管轄了八千八百萬人口，我們希望政府承認這些前方民主政權，管理和指導這些政權。在黨的方面，我們要求政府給中共以公開合法的地位，對其他黨派也是如此。我們希望政府撤銷對陜甘寧邊區政府的軍事封鎖與經濟封鎖，使邊區的人員商旅能夠有行動交通往返上的自由。</p>
<p>我們黨向政府與國民黨中央提出了這樣的意見，國民政府曾有一個提示案給我們，張王兩先生要我們照中央提示案來辦理，但這兩者中間的差別距離很大，以致談判到今毫無結果。本人現在僅略舉幾個較大的分岐之點來加以說明。</p>
<p>首先從軍事問題來說，中共所領導作戰的正規部隊四十七萬七千五百人，八年來在異常艱苦的環境，堅持與發展了北，華中，華同三大戰塲，並成爲將來總反攻的先鋒部隊，爲了準備反攻的需要，政府應當獎勵它，增强它，首先應該全部編成四十七個師才是合理。西安談判時我提出請求政府暫編六軍十八個師，張王兩先生表示困難接受，我黨中央六月四日提案請先給五個軍十六個師的番號，而政府仍不願答應，只答應編四軍十個師。</p>
<p>特別是政府提示案中的編餘部隊「限期取銷，」及已編者「限期集中」二點辦法，未能顧到戰事需要與游擊戰爭的環境。限期取銷，就等於不要人民抗戰，把攻復地區再交給敵人，這自然是不應該的。</p>
<p>再從對民選地方政府的分岐之點來言。前方的各民選政府，全是民權主義性質的。我們要求政府承認這些區域的民選政府爲其所管轄的地方政府，中央提示案則要取銷，這是從抗戰利益上不可理解的。</p>
<p>再次關於黨派的公開合法地位，與人民言論集會結社身體自由的保障等問題，依目前情形而論，并未見有何改善。我們略舉幾例來談判言論自由問題，政府已表示言論尺度放寬，而實際上我們在前方近幾個月來打了不少仗，這戰報每月呈送軍令部，始終未能發璷，送新華日報也是被扣；再如人民身體自由，政府自八月一日宣佈責行保障的規定，但是實際上，我們一再要求釋放葉挺將軍，他旣非共產黨員，去新四軍更爲政府所勸請，不應該拘禁他。我們要求釋放自香港淪陷後返粵被捕的廖仲凱先生公子廖承志。此外還有很多政治犯身囚監中，我們也要求釋放，俱都未能做到。</p>
<p>共方自謂實踐諾言雙方意見相距仍遠</p>
<p>還有，張王兩先生給本人的信中也曾責備我黨不實行四項諾言，這一點也要加以說明。我們去年十二月曾在延安開會認眞檢討，檢討結果，更證明我們四項諾言確實完全做到了，信守不渝。譬如拿第一條：「孫中山先生的三民主義爲中國今日之必需，本黨願爲其澈底實現而奮鬥」來說，我們對民族主義的實行，表現在努力作戰，以及對邊區境內各民族平等地位的尊重上面；我們對民權主義的實行，表現在邊區及前方各根據地民選政府，實行三三制，保障人民言論集會結社身體等一切自由上面；努力生產運動，减輕人民的負担，由前年二十萬担公糧减到今年只徵十六萬担，我們不把公家的負担，全部壓到老百姓頭上。第二條：「取消一切推翻國民黨政權的暴動政策，及赤化運動，停止以暴力沒收地主土地的政策」七年來我們堅守不渝。在農民與地主的關係中，我們是一方面保證交租交息，一方面實行減租減息；我們帮助私人工業的發展，並發展合作社，做到公私兼顧，公私兩利。我們也早已實踐了諾言，從無也從未曾想過要推翻國民黨政權的事情。第三條：「取消現在的蘇維埃政府，實行民權政治，以求全國政權之統一」這在各前方根據地已經切實在實行民權政治，我們並不曾另立中央政府，我們只要求政府承認陜甘寗邊區與前方各民選政府，爲它所管轄的地方政府，我們是贊成統一的，中國也必須統一，但統一必須是民主的統一。第四條：「取消紅軍名義及番號，改編爲國民革命軍，受國民政府軍事委員會之統轄，並待命出動，担任作戰前綫之實」，我們對此也是實行已久，我們的軍隊在前方艱苦作戰的成績就是證明。我們的部隊幾年來從未得料彈一餉之接濟，而仍堅持前方戰爭，擁護國民政府將委員長。凡此事實都足以說明我們已經實踐了諾言。張王兩先生曾指責我們立法監察的不獨立，但是我們在司法方面已做到切實保障各階層人民的人權財權和地權等等，我們完全依靠人民來執行彈劾政府，所以我們那邊絕少貪汚瀆職事件發生。</p>
<p>雖然，雙方的距離還如此遠，可是要珍可以再度聲明，中國共產黨是一貫堅持團結抗戰方針，耐心的期待政府觀點的改變。</p>
<p>敘述談判擱淺經過指摘渝方歪曲事實</p>
<p>現在，本人再來說明一下自西安到重慶與張王兩先生談判的經過。自從國民十一中全會決議對國共關係採取政治解決方針以後，我們在延安聽到了很高興，非常贊成。因爲自民國二十九年新四軍事件以後，兩黨關係很僵，我是參政員，也因封鎖而不能出來，我們請軍事委員駐延聯絡參謀打電報出來，表明我們願來重慶繼續談判，經政府覆電同意後，本人因負邊區政務，尙需佈置春耕關係，直到四月底才能動身。在西安與張王兩先生一共會談五次，本人初見張王兩先生，主要先請示政府的政治解決究竟是如何解決法？以及向他們報告邊區情形。張王兩先生一再要我提出具體問題來談，我當時提出以本年三月十二日國父誕辰周恩來同志的演說作談判基礎，張王兩先生不贊成，他們提議先談軍事，及邊區問題，我認爲也可以，因先報告了中共領導下軍隊的數目，並問中央可以答應給我們編多少？張先生要我講，我說請先給六個軍十八個師，張王兩先生認爲太多，只同意四個軍十二個師，以後會商幾次，到最後一次會面時談話，商定將歷次會談雙方意見整理成記錄，雙方簽字，各報告其中央，由兩黨中央作最後決定，當時我就照我們雙方原先約定的首先在這紀錄上簽字，但張王兩先生朱簽，紀錄係綜合雙方意見而成，張王信裏只是我個人意見，顯然不是事實。</p>
<p>到重慶以後，我黨中央即來電報提出二十項意見，由我於五月二十二日交張王兩先生，請其轉陳國民黨中央，張王兩先生認爲有些條件這樣提法無異宣佈國民黨罪狀，不肯接受。本人爲尊重張王兩先生意見起見，向我黨中央請示，將二十條必爲十二條，其餘八條改爲口頭要求，由本人於六月五日送交張王兩先生，張王兩先生同時將政府提示案交給我，但對我黨中央提案則不允收轉，一直爭執到六月十五日，才覆信稱已轉呈政府，但解決辦法仍照政府提示案不能變更，談判遂呈僵局。</p>
<p>當時國民黨中央宣傳部部長梁寒操先生曾對外國記者發表談話說，談判停頓，中共要覺悟才好。我於七月二日有談話發表在新華日報，表示我黨的態度是只要對於抗戰團結與促進民主有利，我們都可商量。七月二十六日，梁部長又發表不合事實之談話英文稿，我黨周恩來同志於八月十三日曾發表談話，說明談判並無結果，並解釋此事責任並非在我。但我黨中央仍希望談判能有結果，曾來電請張王兩先生赴延安繼續談判。張王兩先生說此事可以商量。兩黨談判的經過情形大致如此。</p>
<p>攻擊渝方政治不良要求組織聯合政府</p>
<p>最後，我應當聲明：中國共產黨很盼望把問題解決，我們所提出的意見都是正確的合理的，希望政府能一切從抗戰民主團結利益出發，接受我們的合理要求。我們中國的抗戰要保持今天的國際光榮地位，要得到永久和平，都不能坐待盟友的奮鬥，需要更靠我們自己的努力，需要團結與動員全國力量，才足以停止敵人的進攻及準備力量配合盟邦的反攻，我們認爲挽救目前軍事危機準備反攻的急救辦法，必須對政府的機構人事政策迅速來一個改弦更張。這幾天參政員諸先生的各項詢問，也正說明了我們政府的機構人事到政策都有很多毛病，不能適合今天戰爭的要求。因此我坦白的提出希望國民黨立即結束一黨統治的局面，由國民政府召開各黨各派，各作戰部隊，各地方政府，各人民團體的代表，開國事會議，組織各黨派聯合政府，一新天下耳目，振奮全國人心，鼓勵前方士氣，以加强全國團結，集中全國人材，集中全國力量。（全文完）</p>

<h3>「秋海棠」公演速寫</h3>
<p>— 公嘉</p>
<p>「秋海棠」是一齣打破歷來賣座記錄的名劇，兩年前在卡爾登戲院公演時，遠近轟傳，萬人空巷，連演數月之久，足見其感人之深矣。此次苦幹劇團爲籌募基金重演是劇，闌心戲院門口車水馬龍，盛况依舊，而演出之佳，更能超越前次之成績，筆者躬與其盛，敢將公演情形拉雜記之，以公同好。</p>
<p>演出陣容中如沈敏之羅湘綺，上官靈珠之梅寳，史原之趙玉崑，白文之季兆雄，劉基之羅少華等，皆屬一時之選，而以石揮，張伐雙演前後秋海棠，尤爲難能可貴。較初演之陣容更爲堅强整齊。</p>
<p>劇情自第四幕起潮入悲境，至第五幕第二塲羅湘綺與梅寳在酒樓母女相會時，沈敏與上官麗珠演來異常動人，觀衆多有哭不能仰者。</p>
<p>前半部秋海棠張伐演得瀟洒可愛，後半部石揮演得蒼凉沉鬱，英雄氣短，兒女情長，令人不禁揮一掬同情之淚。敎戲一塲四座掌聲雷動，周無怪其然也。</p>
<p>史原之趙玉崑乾脆爽利，白文之季兆雄刁滑陰險，王駿之小狗子獃頭獃腦，莊嚴之啞丫頭天眞戀黠，樂遙之袁寳藩粗擴醜憨，辛安之尙老二旣油又酸，以上諸角無不刻劃入微，相得益彰，使全劇生色不少。</p>
<p>劇終時觀衆熟烈鼓掌，甚至有高聲呌好者，必待演員一再謝幕，觀衆始興盡而敵，迨至門口，筆者猶見有以手帕拭淚者，戲劇感人之潔，於此可見一斑。</p>

<h3>如何壓平滬市物價</h3>
<p>— 蔣廉駿</p>
<p>一年來本市物價飛　，生意銳减，運　　滯，百業衰　；民生凋疲，至　已極。民爲邦本，本固邦　，得民者　，古有明訓。上海爲全國物資供應中心，豈可長令惡化，使民力日竭，民生日　。筆者爰就目前癥結所在，略實數點，幸希關注民　之新市政當局　察焉！</p>
<p>（甲）治標方面：　必須澈民底檢查全市倉庫：溯自去年十一月本市經濟局會同經濟保安處實施檢查各大公私倉庫，對主要日用品有一。超越營業範圍之鉅額儲　，二·堆廠年月　久，三·非業中人所儲存，均行取締，執行以來，怱怱二月，此二月間：物價仍作反常　昂，漲勢之盛，爲事變後所稀見，雖曰有種種基本原因，要也投機商對檢查倉庫一節，抱過分之樂觀所致，此中經過及其成效，明眼人當不難洞悉。故今後宜另派幹部人員嚴厲監視外，對檢查人員待遇亦須儘量提高，使能安心職務。以後一經發覺越軌情事，立依戰事刑法處以最嚴厲懲罰。若僅賴一紙文吿，囑商民於檢查員有不法需索時，向當局報吿；須知商民旣巳犯法，始有被敲詐可能，如在報吿，無異自投羅網，雖至愚者亦不致出此。</p>
<p>嚴格評訂及執行限價：關於物價評議會所頒布之限價，事實上過去殊少成效，往往昨日限價，今日黑市即出。今日而欲向全市烟舖購一枝限價洋燭或一塊限價肥皂，恐踏破鐵鞋尙無覓處！一出高價，便予求予取。故現行限價實無益人民，反有助長黑市現象，今後不欲評定限價則巳，果欲限價，如發現超越或拒售等情，切不宜再照去年辦法，閥停業數天了事，此種罰法，反爲狡猾商人所樂受，蓋正可名正言順，閉門拒售，坐待漲價也！故對違犯者，須立予拘傳，依法提起公訴。</p>
<p>（乙）治本方面：　迅速撤消食米運滬限制：食米問題爲今日本市最嚴重之問題，回憶去年全年所配戶口米糧，總數未及三斗半，每月平均不足三升，而秋收登塲後之十，十一，十二，三月，每月所配不過二升，試問區區之數，如不顧黑市供應，民食何以爲繼？迄今一般市民之對戶口米反不存奢望，但希　負之米價格稍廉。是以今後應恢復去年七八月間之憑照搬運辦法。本市米價高漲，影響一般工業品之成本，農村物價隨之，農作物成本亦必提高。此其一·農民目睹上海米加之　昂，心有慾望，必致增加收買工作之困難，此其二·一經自由搬運，米價當可壓低。如爲防止富有者囤儲起見，不妨實施下列三點</p>
<p>第一；申請撥遲運謹照以本市登記米店爲限，每次數量以五百石爲最高額。</p>
<p>第二：米店於搬入食米後，仍須憑配給聯票售予市民，規定每月一次領購，數量不得超過一斗半。少者聽之；價格以成本酌加利潤計算。再爲使商民競賣起見，能憑第×期聯票而不依另賣店號碼，得自由向任何一家購買。</p>
<p>第三：米店須逐旬向糧管當局製表報吿採銷數量並附呈證件。同時繳銷護照。</p>
<p>以上三點如能實行，則民食不致匱乏，米店不致長愁坐吃，至於戶口米，不妨依照重點主義配給。</p>
<p>解救燃料恐慌，宜如何愼重再與華北當局商討煤斤南雲問題，並設法以獎勵躉運，沿途並予便利。則本市裝有木柴引擎工廠，得以繼續生產。市民所需燃料，亦得源源供應</p>
<p>宗旨事在人爲，際茲市政刷新，我人對新市政當局實寄予無窮希望也</p>
<p>本報徵求之「新年市聲依照規定刋至本月十六日爲止，未經刋出各文，移至國民論壇選載，稿酬並依國民論壇標準計算，尙希惠文諸君公鑒。</p>

(2) A powerful Japanese advancing unit broke into the enemy lines near San Fabian on the night of January 16th, achieving great results. The unit's assault targeted enemy artillery moving in that area, and as of the morning of the 18th, they had not yet begun firing.</p>
<p>Manila, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The enemy attempted to occupy Manila during this Luzon Island campaign. However, fearing a frontal assault on Manila, which would inevitably be met with a prepared ambush by Japanese forces and result in heavy bloodshed, the enemy has not yet landed in Manila Bay. However, such landings can be expected in the future, and it is even more necessary to be vigilant against paratrooper landings. The Japanese army will undoubtedly be able to deploy its winning tactics against these. As for the Japanese soldiers in Manila, they are preparing for the coming decisive battle.</p>
<p>Japanese Elite Forces Stand Ready in Strict Formation</p>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Asahi Shimbun here recently reported on the strength and losses of the American forces in the Philippines, stating that the enemy is currently combining strong forces to carry out operations in the Philippines, including Leyte Island, seven islands, Mindoro Island, and Lingayen Bay, four islands. Luzon Island is encountering the largest land force enemy forces have encountered since the start of the war. However, in the Leyte area, due to the heroic fighting of Japanese special attack units and land forces, the enemy suffered heavy losses. According to the headquarters of General MacArthur on the 25th of last month, the total number of killed, wounded, and missing was 11,217. More than a month has passed since then, and the enemy's losses are estimated to have reached tens of thousands. At the same time, on the Luzon Island front, Japanese elite forces are standing ready in strict formation, and if the American forces attack again, they will inevitably suffer even greater sacrifices.</p>
<p>Enemy Forces in Lingayen Gulf Fear Assaults and Raids</p>
<p>Luzon Island Frontline Base, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) – After the enemy landed in Lingayen Gulf, they have clearly failed to advance due to the fierce attacks of the Japanese army. Currently, what the enemy fears most are the special attack units descending from the sky and the assault troops in the night. Before the landing, in order to prevent the valiant collisions of the Japanese special attack units, despite the protection of a large fleet, they disguised transport ships as aircraft carriers or divided soldiers into small boats, doing their best to disperse in order to avoid losses. Their purpose was to prevent attacks from the land-based Japanese forces. In the Leyte battle line, they strengthened numerous machine gun positions around the perimeter of their positions and installed countless sound collectors in front. This time, deeply aware of the difficulty of preventing Japanese assault troops, they used a large number of military dogs in Lingayen Bay, deploying them around the perimeter of their positions. However, the resolute Japanese suicide squads did not take this to heart and continued their fierce attacks through the night, the enemy desperately defending.</p>
<p>Two Attempts to Cross the Bitin River Were Valiantly Repulsed</p>
<p>Philippine Frontline Base, 18th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a report from a certain Japanese base on the 17th, on the evening of the 14th, the battle in the Lingayen Gulf area unfolded with the area east of San Fabian and the Biti-nao area to its southeast as the center. While facing each other in the direction of Biti-nao to the south, the enemy twice attempted to cross the Bito River and attack on the 14th, but both times they were valiantly repulsed by the Japanese army and suffered great damage. The enemy also infiltrated the highlands four kilometers west of Luzon and continued to engage in small-scale battles. On the Nao front, the enemy's main force attempted to break through the Japanese lines but was ultimately repulsed by the Japanese army. In addition, the focus of the enemy's naval shelling and bombing was on attacking Nao. At the same time, the Japanese army also concentrated heavy firepower and fiercely bombarded enemy ships, positions, and supply depots.</p>
<p>Many British Killed and Wounded in Bombing of Hong Kong Internment Camp</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The enemy mobile units that invaded the South China Sea began attacking on the 15th and 16th, aiming at various parts of Portuguese-controlled Macau, destroying hospitals, and massacring civilians and third-country nationals, demonstrating extreme cruelty. During the air raid on Hong Kong, they also strafed the Hong Kong internment camp for people from enemy nations, causing many British casualties. Therefore, the British are extremely angry and indignant at the American planes' indiscriminate bombing. It is reported that the enemy carrier-based planes that attacked on the afternoon of the 16th, due to the fierce fire from Japanese anti-aircraft guns, dropped fifteen or sixteen bombs on the Hong Kong internment camp. The houses in the internment camp were shattered and destroyed. Fifteen British people were killed (ten men and five women), and four were seriously injured (two men and two women). The enemy planes continued to strafe with machine guns, wounding dozens of people severely (including thirty British). According to records, the internment camp was registered by the Japanese with the International Red Cross in Geneva after the start of the war, which the British and Americans should have known. Moreover, the weather was very clear at the time of the air raid, so there was no possibility of error in identification even from high altitude. Therefore, those interned are extremely indignant at the American planes' blind bombing. The former Chief Civil Administrator of the Hong Kong Governor's Office, Gimson, presented a letter to the Japanese authorities on the 17th in his capacity as a representative of the internment camp, strongly condemning the inhumane behavior of the American planes and expressing his intense anger, while also thanking the Japanese authorities for their post-disaster arrangements.</p>

<h3>Air Battle Over Osaka and Kobe: Battle Results Under Investigation, Ten Enemy Planes Shot Down in Sett Area</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 5:40 PM on the 19th: Eighty enemy P-29 type planes attacked Osaka, Kobe, and other places from the Mariana Islands on the afternoon of the 19th. The results of the interception battle are currently under investigation. There has been some slight damage to the ground on the Japanese side.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Thirty-six enemy planes invaded the Sett area on the 16th. The Japanese air force immediately intercepted them, shooting down six (one unconfirmed) and destroying four. Japanese losses were very slight.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) – At approximately 9:20 AM on the 18th, one B-29 type plane from the Mariana base intruded into the Osaka and Kobe areas of Japan for reconnaissance. The Japanese air defense forces immediately intercepted it, and the enemy plane was hit by anti-aircraft fire over Osaka. It attempted to escape, dropping its cargo into the Kumano Sea, but Japanese fighters continued to pursue it, launching a fierce attack and shooting it down.</p>
<h3>North China University Students Inspection Group Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency dispatch) – A group of fifteen students from the North China University Winter Vacation Inspection Group arrived in Shanghai by train early on the 18th.</p>
<h3>Japanese Navy Awaits Action, Production Power Progressing Smoothly</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Yomiuri Shimbun recently published an article titled "Japanese Navy Awaits Action," stating the following: After the American mobile forces carried out air raids in the Taiwan area, their main force invaded the South China Sea from the Bashi Channel. On the 15th and 16th, they attacked Taiwan, Hong Kong, Guangdong, Shantou, and ships sailing in the South China Sea again, hindering the Japanese military's supply capabilities and attempting to isolate the Philippines. The Japanese Navy immediately prepared its stance after the air battle over Taiwan and the naval battle in the Philippines last October. The modern navy, mainly composed of the air force, awaits the opportunity to annihilate the enemy American mobile forces. Although Japanese production is under enemy bombing, it is still progressing smoothly. The Japanese naval power, backed by the blood and sweat of a hundred million people, will surely destroy the enemy mobile forces.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Stabilizing Prices First</h3>
<p>We have repeatedly called for the urgency of stabilizing prices, and we have repeatedly contributed our humble opinions on how to stabilize prices. However, despite the expectations of all parties, prices continue to rise rather than fall, making it difficult to alleviate the situation. High prices are the source of all the suffering of the citizens. As we pointed out in a recent editorial, as the mayoralty changes, the most important thing for the citizens to pray for is the stabilization of prices, and the first thing that the new municipal authorities should do with decisive measures is to stabilize prices. So today we want to shout loudly to the municipal authorities:</p>
<p>"Stabilizing Prices First!"</p>
<p>There are several factors that are currently keeping prices slightly calm!</p>
<p>First, the so-called "big rise, small fall" (actually a big rise, a small leveling) is a common phenomenon after a big rise in prices in recent years. Originally, after a big rise in prices, on the one hand, due to the sudden decline in social purchasing power and the need for speculators to recuperate, there is often a very short period of stagnation. On the other hand, tightening credit and weakening hoarding in the midst of price fluctuations invisibly tend to stabilize prices slightly. At the same time, under the supervision of public opinion, the authorities routinely make statements or talks about cracking down on and suppressing speculation. Although these are not necessarily effective in practice, speculators avoid the limelight by observing and waiting, thus slightly curbing the rising price trend, which is also a fact.</p>
<p>Second, the Lunar New Year is approaching, and all industries are busy preparing for settlement or conserving energy for the coming year. The market changes from activity to stillness, a phenomenon that occurs every year. Moreover, as the Lunar New Year approaches, not only is credit tight in all industries, but individuals are also particularly strapped for cash. With tight funds and reduced purchases, the so-called weakness of prices naturally becomes inevitable. Before the end of the Lunar New Year, if there are no excessive stimuli, prices are unlikely to jump wildly again.</p>
<p>All of the above are cyclical and short-term phenomena. Once the Lunar New Year is over, a wave of high prices may repeat itself. Moreover, cyclical price increases are ultimately fiercer each time. According to past experience, the rising trend at the beginning of the Lunar New Year will be even more intense than usual. Therefore, the terrible degree of the high-price wave that may return soon may be even greater than before. This is not alarmist talk. If the source of supplies still cannot be unblocked and price stabilization measures are still not perfect, the crisis is indeed very deep.</p>
<p>How to prevent the crisis of cyclical price increases? And how to further eliminate it? This is the urgent work that the municipal authorities must do. We have always believed that the sharp rise in prices in Shanghai, in addition to economic reasons such as insufficient supplies and poor transportation, is mainly due to artificial manipulation. Taking the price of rice over the past year and a half as an example, the price of rice was 1,800 yuan per picul in July of the 32nd year. By December of the 33rd year, it had risen to more than 40,000 yuan per picul, a difference of more than 20 times. The degree of skyrocketing has actually exceeded the possible extent of economic reasons. Price increases for economic reasons must be addressed with targeted remedies, while skyrocketing prices for artificial reasons must also be suppressed with targeted measures. Therefore, in addition to making every effort to increase production, unblock the source of supplies, and improve allocation, it is necessary to take severe measures to crack down on hoarding, investigate speculation, and prohibit official-business collusion. It is said that another reason for the slight price leveling these days is that speculators are shaken by the prestige of Chief Zhou and Chief Luo and the disconnection between officials and businessmen during the transition between the old and new administrations, so they dare not continue to be unscrupulous, which is certainly not without some relationship. In view of this, if the authorities can truly be impartial and exercise decisive measures in the future, giving severe punishments, they will certainly achieve great results in stabilizing prices. "In times of chaos, harsh punishments should be used," "Kill one to warn a hundred." We look forward to the exercise of iron-fisted measures by the municipal authorities. The "hope" that Mayor Zhou mentioned in his message to the citizens, the citizens' hopes are not too great. If prices can be stabilized and life can be slightly more stable, it can be said that a large part of their hopes have been realized.</p>
<h3>Enemy Forces on Luzon Island Plunged into Fierce Fighting, Captain Shiota Discusses the Philippine Island Battle Situation</h3>
<p>As usual, the Press Department of the Allied Japanese Fleet in China held a meeting with reporters from local Chinese and Japanese newspapers at 2:00 PM on the 19th. Department Head Matsushima returned to Japan on official business, and Captain Shiota represented him, introducing the newly appointed naval advisor Masao Akita to the reporters. Then, he gave a detailed explanation of the current state of the war:</p>
<p>Crisis for Enemy Forces in Eastern Luzon</p>
<p>The ground battles on the Philippine Islands have matured since the evening of the 16th. Now the enemy and our forces are engaged in fierce fighting on a 50-kilometer-long battle line centered on Lingayen Gulf. The enemy is attacking from three directions: east, west, and center. Their main force is in Pinmneg, a village located several miles east of Lingayen Gulf. According to enemy reports, the western force has advanced the furthest, having crossed the Agno River. However, it is not yet known exactly where the enemy crossed the Agno River, which is a winding river flowing from south to northeast. At the same time, enemy reports indicate that the eastern force is in fierce fighting. Compared to the east, the west has made slightly more progress. The east has been subjected to fierce Japanese attacks and has been unable to make any progress beyond a few miles from the coastline. Based on this, it can be judged that the Japanese are using powerful mobile forces to ambush the enemy in the central plain of Luzon Island to the east of Lingayen Gulf. Japanese troops have also landed in San Fabian, and the enemy's eastern force is bound to be wiped out. The enemy's operations have been extremely slow since the landing ten days ago. Especially from the 16th to the present, the enemy has suffered serious damage, and future operations will become increasingly difficult. The enemy relies on its abundant supplies and is desperately investing in Lingayen Gulf. The Japanese forces often reduce or eliminate enemy supplies and inflict heavy blows in Mindoro Island and Sulu Sea, Moitai Island with surprise tactics. In the future, the enemy's operations will inevitably suffer major sacrifices. The enemy in Lingayen Gulf is now suffering extremely heavy damage. The Japanese have no intention of engaging in a decisive battle on the coastline, and will surely lure the enemy to the wide plains. Then, it will be possible to expand and contract freely, causing the enemy to be lured in with large forces, and then suffer heavy losses and major blows.</p>
<p>Naval Decisive Battle Approaching</p>
<p>General Yamashita, the supreme commander of the army, and Vice Admiral Okawauchi, the supreme commander of the navy, are both famous generals. They will certainly achieve considerable results in terms of operations. Regarding land battles, the most noteworthy aspects for the navy are the movements of the Nimitz Fleet and the British Pacific Fleet. The Nimitz Fleet, which was almost completely wiped out in the naval battles off Taiwan and the Philippines, has been reorganized to serve as a shield for the MacArthur forces. In terms of operations, the enemy is attempting to disrupt the supply routes from the Japanese mainland to Taiwan and the Philippines, and from China to the Philippines. They have often engaged in such activities in the past. The enemy also has a desire to obtain a base even further afield than the Philippines if possible. However, their greatest task is still to disrupt supply routes. The recent bombing in South China is also proof of the disruption of supply routes. The Japanese navy has completed replenishing aircraft after the two naval battles off Taiwan and the Philippines. The preparations for the next great naval battle have also been completed. How to deal with the Nimitz Fleet is the most pressing issue at present. The American navy already feels its own power is weak, so it is strongly urging the British Pacific Fleet to participate in the operation, and it is also asking the British Indian Ocean Fleet to feign operations in the Sumatra area to divert attention. The time for the naval decisive battle is becoming increasingly mature, and in the near future, the Japanese will secure the final victory. The Nimitz forces' dream of coming to China is gradually becoming an impossible situation. In the future, the activities of enemy submarines and aircraft on the southeastern coast of China may be unavoidable, but they will have no impact on the decisive battle.</p>
<p>The US Will Scheme Against Yan'an</p>
<p>Recently, after the American army arrived in the Philippines, it will use political tactics to scheme against the Communist Party centered on Yan'an. The US is roping in the Communist Party for political reasons, which clearly shows that it does not trust the Chongqing regime. American newspapers have also reported on this extensively. The Chongqing regime hopes that the American army will come to China, but instead it is giving the CCP an opportunity to expand its territory. This is truly the contradictory hope of the Chongqing side.</p>
<p>American Production Cannot Meet Demand</p>
<p>Captain Toyota also commented on the domestic situation in the United States. He claimed that the United States boasts of its abundant manpower and resources and is confident of winning this grand war. However, it has ultimately suffered unprecedented losses due to the fierce attacks of the Japanese army and is in a desperate situation. The telegrams issued by the American news agencies in San Francisco and Washington on the 19th are sufficient to expose the situation in the country. The original telegram reads: "Today, on the Pacific front, especially in the operations in the Philippines, the supply, repair, and replenishment problems of the American fleet have entered a critical state. Because the American fleet currently operating in that area all need repair, the lack of workers in the American production line has caused the number of ships in urgent need of repair to pile up like mountains. The production of new ships is also slow and stagnant, which will have a significant impact on future operations. In addition, the manufacturing of new weapons is extremely busy, which requires an increase in equipment and labor. From the naval perspective alone, due to the losses suffered by ships in the war against Japan, the number of ships in need of repair and new construction is increasing daily, resulting in a phenomenon of supply falling short of demand." Based on this frank admission from the American news agency, it can be seen that the American operations are difficult and the domestic situation is dire.</p>
<h3>Nissho Prepares to Establish Savings Bank</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Japanese Ministry of Finance and the Japanese Bank have been discussing the merger of the People's Savings Banks in the three cities of Tokyo, Nagoya, and Osaka to establish a savings bank.

<h3>British Troops Stationed in Thessaloniki</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to an Athens dispatch: Based on the ceasefire agreement previously signed with British Army Commander Scobie, the Greek ELAS group withdrew from Thessaloniki, the second largest city in Greece, on the 18th. British troops also completely moved into the city and its 320-kilometer-radius strongholds that night without encountering any resistance.</p>
<h3>Actions of Former Czech President Beneš</h3>
<p>Berlin Pays Attention</p>
<p>Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) – German News Agency reports that Berlin political circles are paying special attention to the British news that former Czech President Beneš intends to travel to Carpathian Ukraine. Beneš anticipates that Carpathian Ukraine will have a development similar to Lublin, so he intends to go there himself to prevent the collapse of the Czech national structure. However, it remains to be seen whether Moscow will allow him to go there.</p>
<h3>American Shipbuilding Competition: Extreme Fear in Britain</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) – German News Agency reports, according to New York sources: US Navy Rear Admiral Land stated that based on the current American shipbuilding process, the United States will have 50 million tons of shipping after the war, with a total tonnage almost equal to two-thirds of the world's commercial shipping tonnage, and four times greater than what the United States possessed before the war. Conversely, Britain's tonnage will decrease by 50%. London newspapers say that Britain expresses surprise at this phenomenon, because this is a prelude to the expansion of American exports to the world.</p>

<h3>Japanese Parliament to Reconvene Tomorrow: Deliberations on Decisive War Measures; House of Representatives Budget Committee to Hold Regular Meeting</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) – The 86th session of the Japanese Parliament, which adjourned on the 27th of last month, is now scheduled to resume on the 21st of this month. During this recess, the war situation in East Asia has become even more critical. Therefore, the government authorities announced five emergency decisive war measures at the cabinet meeting on the 12th, aimed at swiftly implementing new regulations. These measures include a re-examination of the new national organization centered on the Imperial Rule Assistance Association (翼政會). This reconvened parliament will focus on completing the final stages of the domestic decisive war system, conducting extremely detailed deliberations.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Koiso Vows Determination</p>
<p>Upon the reconvening of Parliament on the 21st, both houses will hold their respective plenary sessions at designated times. The House of Peers is scheduled to convene at 10:00 AM, where Prime Minister Koiso will deliver a policy address, expressing the government's determination for the decisive war and urging the 100 million citizens to demonstrate a spirit of special attack (特攻). At that time, the government will also provide detailed explanations of the following decided implementation items: (1) Strengthening the air defense system, (2) Thoroughly enhancing military production increase, (3) Striving to increase food production and strengthen the self-sufficiency system, (4) Enhancing the labor system and national labor mobilization, (5) Thoroughly converting all resources into war power.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Shigemitsu to Deliver Speech</p>
<p>Following the Prime Minister's address, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu will deliver a speech specifically on diplomatic policy, clarifying Japan's wartime diplomacy during the decisive war phase. The plenary session of the House of Representatives in the afternoon will be similar to that of the House of Peers. However, after the policy speeches by the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Finance Minister Ishiwata will announce financial measures, followed by a representative question from Kanemitsu Tsuneo (金光庸夫), Chairman of the Parliament's Steering Committee. Formal deliberations are scheduled to begin on the same day. The current parliamentary session has given special consideration to the decisive nature of parliamentary deliberations. On the House of Peers side, representative questions on policy speeches have also been suspended, and the composition of special committees has been simplified.</p>
<p>Provisional Military Expenses Soon to be Decided</p>
<p>On the House of Representatives side, the focus of deliberations is also limited, and comprehensive measures are in place to promptly organize crucial questions, with the aim of achieving focused deliberations. The government has already decided on over 30 legislative proposals to be submitted to Parliament, including the general account budget for the next year, amounting to over 22.2 billion yen, and the tax increase plan for the next year, amounting to over 1.9 billion yen. Currently, there is a particular urgency to decide on supplementary budget proposals and provisional military expenses. In response to this, both the House of Peers and the House of Representatives have fully reviewed the government's proposals during the recess. Therefore, the upcoming reconvened parliament will be a short session worthy of being called a battlefield parliament.</p>
<p>Emergency Military Production Increase Measures</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Budget Committee of the House of Representatives is specifically scheduled to convene around the 24th, at which time emergency measures to increase military production will be discussed in detail.</p>
<h3>Japanese House of Representatives Holds Investigative Committee</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) – In preparation for the reconvening of the 86th session of the Japanese Parliament on the 21st, the Japanese House of Representatives held an investigative committee on the afternoon of the 18th. The Ministry of Finance invited Vice-Minister of Finance Kotohara (小童原政務次官) and directors of various related bureaus to attend, explain the general account budget proposal for this year, and answer various questions. The meeting adjourned around 4:00 PM. On the 19th, from 10:00 AM, a cabinet and various ministry committees will convene to hear explanations from the authorities regarding the government's proposed legislative proposals, conduct questioning and review, after which the preliminary review will be completed.</p>
<p>Imperial Rule Assistance Association Decides on Strong New Party Proposal</p>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Rule Assistance Association held a political affairs research meeting at its headquarters on the 18th. Chairman Matsumura (松村會長), Vice-Chairmen Kimura, Kibara, and Murase (木村，木曹，村瀨各副會長), as well as various staff members attended. They reviewed the "Proposal to Form a Strong New Party" decided by the Special Committee for Establishing a Certain Victory Domestic System on the 17th. Finally, it was passed that once the proposal is endorsed by the Standing General Meeting and the Provisional General Affairs Meeting on the 19th and 20th, the formal stance of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association will be decided, and President Yamarin (山林總裁) will inform Prime Minister Koiso.</p>
<h3>Strengthening Air Defense Posture: Japan Decides Budget; Allocates 2 Billion Yen to Increase Facilities</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Information Bureau announced on the 19th that the government, regarding the first item of the five major decisive war measures, the plan to strengthen the air defense posture, has examined its specific plans and is now implementing them, and has decided on a budget of 2 billion yen. The most noteworthy aspect of this decision is the increase in tunnels or air defense facilities. Moreover, these facilities are not limited to general shelters, but are also being implemented in government offices and important facilities to ensure permanence.</p>
<h3>Japanese Cabinet Establishes Wartime Price Deliberation Council</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese government, in order to strengthen the implementation of price policies, has newly established a Wartime Price Deliberation Council within the cabinet, dedicated to deliberating on fundamental countermeasures and operational guidelines for wartime price policies. It was decided at a cabinet meeting on the 19th that the Information Bureau would announce the following: the Wartime Price Deliberation Council will be chaired by the Prime Minister, who will also serve as the chairman. Ten experts on price issues selected from the private sector will serve as members. After the establishment of the Wartime Price Deliberation Council, all central committees, local committees, and price consultation councils that previously had the task of determining prices will be adjusted, abolished, or renamed accordingly.</p>
<h3>German Political Circles Criticize Churchill's Speech</h3>
<p>Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency reports: Political figures here criticized Churchill's speech in the British House of Commons on Thursday. It is said that Churchill praised England's "honest" policy with a hypocritical attitude while expressing jealousy of the increased strength of the United States. It is also said, "England should occupy a leading position in the Mediterranean, which is nothing more than a commentary on England's particular attention to Greece and the abuse of the Italian Bonomi regime. His remarks about Nansfu (南斯夫) are equivalent to acknowledging that the Soviet Union's solution has become a fait accompli, and King Peter must accept this solution from now on, otherwise he will offend England. Churchill reiterated the request for the unconditional surrender of the Axis powers," but the entire German people are currently answering with the words "never," and the enemy's determination to annihilate Germany has been hindered by a nation resolutely fighting for its future destiny.</p>
<h3>German Main Forces West of the Vistula River; Fierce Street Battles in Krakow</h3>
<p>Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency reports: At a press conference on the 18th, a German military spokesman solemnly stated: The main forces of the German army on the Eastern Front have retreated from the Vistula River bend in good order, inflicting extremely heavy losses on Soviet tank formations. The actions of these German forces are now proceeding entirely according to plan. The spokesman replied to reporters' inquiries that only the advance units of Soviet tanks have so far reached the east of Łódź. In the southern sector of the Soviet offensive zone, the fighting has spread to the northern and northwestern suburbs of Krakow.</p>
<p>Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency, military news: Fierce street battles are taking place in the northwestern part of Krakow. Enemy forces attempting to break through in the border area of East Prussia have failed.</p>
<p>German Forces Abandon Czestochowa and Tomaszów</p>
<p>Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency) – German Führer Headquarters announced at noon on the 18th that Czestochowa and Tomaszów had been captured by Soviet forces after fierce street battles.</p>
<p>Soviet Troop Strength Reaches Over 100 Divisions</p>
<p>Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency) – Hai Tong News Agency reports: On the sixth day of the Soviet winter offensive, progress has been made to the west of the battle line, and the place names are all previously unmentioned. However, German forces are still fighting as isolated units behind the Soviet tank vanguard, taking advantage of opportunities to establish strong resistance. Currently, the German High Command is selecting strongholds that can contain the Soviet advance, waiting for an opportunity to fight, so reserve troops have been specially mobilized from the rear to be ready to contain the Soviet advance in time. German forces are currently fiercely resisting the Soviet offensive between Beskids and Mir, where the Soviet force consists of 85 infantry divisions and large numbers of tanks. Twenty new Soviet divisions north of Wisła joined the fighting between Morin and Czech Hanov, attempting to break into the German front line, but were unsuccessful because German forces had already withdrawn from Czech Hanov. The Soviet offensive in the East Prussian border area has not made significant progress. The gap broken through by the Soviet army in the northern border of the German province has been recovered by the German reserve army. The Soviet army simultaneously attacked the Staruboning-Kempinning highway, and although the strength was strong, it was defeated 10 kilometers west of Staruboning.</p>
<p>Political Significance Highly Important</p>
<p>Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency) – The Soviet army launched a strong winter offensive on the 12th, from the area of Budapest to the flank of East Prussia. The strength of the Soviet army's assembled troops and weapons is rare since the beginning of the German-Soviet war four years ago. The intention is to enter the German mainland in one breath and launch a decisive battle. Since the beginning of November last year, the German Supreme Command has issued warnings to the Eastern Army, waiting for the Soviet army to launch a winter offensive, but after two months, the Soviet army gradually began to move. The reason for this is that the British and American countries have not yet expressed their attitude towards the disposal of Poland, and the Soviet Union wants to handle it alone, but is unwilling to pay a high price of sacrifice, only to help the anti-Axis army on the Western Front. Therefore, from this political point of view, the offensive was delayed. The unanimous view of well-informed people here is also that because the Western offensive attempted by Britain and the United States failed due to the German counter-offensive, and the Stalin-Roosevelt-Churchill (史羅邱) meeting is about to be held, the Soviet Union suddenly launched an offensive today in order to occupy a favorable political position at the meeting. According to reliable sources, the Greek Red Elas (愛拉斯) group suddenly concluded a truce agreement with the British-affiliated Greek government. Under the sphere of influence of the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union's adoption of this attitude, along with the winter offensive and the planned three-nation conference, are all political strategies. Another group of scholars believes that if the anti-Axis armies echo each other from east and west and launch a major offensive on both sides, the German army will be difficult to resist. However, the German army took advantage of this opportunity and suddenly switched to offensive operations on the Western Front, forcing the anti-Axis armies to retreat to the remote rear of the Western Front's fortifications, shattering their offensive attempt, making them unable to attack. Therefore, the German army can respond to this Soviet winter offensive with ease. This is the success of Hitler's (希特勒) operational guidance and is greatly admired by military experts. In short, the Soviet winter offensive contains various military and political meanings and has a great impact on the entire European war situation, which is worthy of attention.</p>

<h3>Breakdown of Chongqing-CCP Negotiations (II) Continued from Page 8, 14th</h3>
<p>7. Zhang Zhizhong and Wang Shijie's Further Response</p>
<p>September 10, 1944</p>
<p>To Mr. Zhou Enlai:</p>
<p>Having received and read your letter of August 30th, we note its contents. Our previous letter conveyed the spirit of impartiality and tranquility, explaining which of the CCP's demands the Central Government could accommodate, which it could substantially accommodate, which could be left for future consideration, and which it could not accommodate. Our intention was to engage in sincere and practical discussions in order to resolve the issues. However, your letter resorts to exaggeration and distortion, completely contrary to our expectations. After carefully reading your letter, we do not wish to refute each point, but only offer a brief response on one or two, hoping for your kind consideration.</p>
<p>(1) The Central Government has instructed us to negotiate with you in order to achieve genuine national unity, which means that the CCP must earnestly fulfill its four promises and resolutely support "the unification of national power" and unconditionally obey the command of the Military Commission of the National Government. Your letter states, "We have fully implemented these four promises for the past eight years," and "We Communists have consistently executed the four promises." If the CCP had earnestly fulfilled its promises in the past, why would there be so many instances of the CCP encroaching upon the National Army in various regions? If the CCP is still fulfilling its promises today, why would the Central Government still need to instruct us to discuss issues such as obeying military and political orders?</p>
<p>(2) The Central Government has instructed us to negotiate unity in order to establish a strong foundation for the future constitutional government and the implementation of the entire Three Principles of the People. Regarding how to realize democratic politics and party issues, the Central Government's proposal already contains clear provisions, and our letter of August 10th provided a detailed explanation. However, your letter states that the Central Government "did not mention a single word" about the CCP's demands in this regard. We truly do not know why you made such an untruthful statement. What makes us even more perplexed is that your letter states, "We have thoroughly implemented the Three Principles of the People in the border region and various base areas," and that in all CCP-controlled areas, "all people and organizations enjoy all freedoms and rights." If the facts are as stated in your letter, we can only express our admiration. However, many facts compel us to deny this. Even with regard to democracy and freedom, Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings clearly advocated the separation of the five powers as the correct path to democracy and the guarantee of the people's freedom. The National Government does not dare to claim that it has completed all preparations for this point, and therefore does not dare to claim that it has "thoroughly implemented the Three Principles of the People." Does the CCP area have independent judicial power, independent supervisory power, and so on? Do the people in the CCP area, or even the Communist Party members, have guarantees of freedom of speech, freedom of person, and so on? If not, then for the sake of earnestly implementing the Three Principles of the People, how can we, as your letter suggests, ask the Central Government to "promote and implement throughout the country" the CCP's "various democratic measures and democratic laws"? Our previous letter urged the CCP to refrain from raising boundless abstract demands on issues such as democracy and freedom, which would only increase future disputes, and instead to engage in practical discussions with the Central Government, the National Political Council, and the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association to find proper solutions to various issues. After reading your letter, we feel even more strongly that what we said in our previous letter was not only appropriate but also necessary.</p>
<p>Regarding the above two points, we hope that future discussions will not be merely empty words. As for the other statements in your letter that distort the facts, we have already responded to them one by one. Regarding issues such as troop strength and troop movements, our previous letter and oral explanations have already provided explanations, and we feel there is no need to repeat them. However, there is one point that we must solemnly declare: our previous letter stated that the Central Government's proposal had "largely accommodated" the opinions proposed by Commander Lin Biao (林彪) last year and by you recently in Xi'an. This is an absolutely truthful statement, without the slightest exaggeration. We believe that any third party, if they were to take the four articles proposed by Commander Lin Biao and the document you signed in Xi'an and compare them one by one with the Central Government's proposal of June 25th of this year, would find that our statement of "largely accommodated" is true. However, your letter still emphasizes the words "too far apart." If the Central Government's proposal is indeed "too far apart" from the CCP's demands, what is the reason for this? In a nutshell: it is only because the CCP's demands have increased with time. The opinions you expressed in Xi'an were more than the demands proposed by Commander Lin Biao last year, and the twelve articles proposed by the CCP on June 4th were more than the demands you made in Xi'an. This time, in your letter, you have added the so-called "eight oral articles" to the twelve articles. Since the demands are increasing with time, the distance cannot but be far. For example, the issue of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and the so-called "other base areas," in the four articles proposed by Commander Lin Biao, it was stipulated that "the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region should be changed to an administrative region according to the original area, and other regions should be reorganized separately to implement the Central Government's laws." The issue of "other base areas" was not included in the document you signed in Xi'an. In the twelve conditions proposed by the CCP on June 4th, it was requested that "the elected governments of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and the North China base areas" be recognized. In your letter this time, it is even stated that "the elected governments of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and the North China, Central China, and South China base areas" should be recognized. In this situation of gradually expanding demands, if the negotiations fail to come close, who is responsible for this? The work of resisting Japan and building the nation is urgently awaiting completion. To this day, our country and nation still do not possess the minimum conditions for successful resistance and nation-building (that is, national unity). The Central Government and the Kuomintang comrades cannot but deeply reflect on this. Your letter states that in resolving the relationship between the KMT and the CCP, the interests of the entire country and nation should be placed first, not the interests of one party or faction. These words are excellent. We firmly believe that the Central Government and the Kuomintang will never place the interests of one party or faction above the interests of the country and nation. Therefore, we sincerely hope that the CCP will also abide by these words, so that the negotiations can make progress and all issues can be reasonably resolved.</p>
<p>As for your invitation to us to go to Yan'an, as long as it is beneficial to the matter, we are also happy to go, but it would be appreciated if you could inform us whether the CCP can send a responsible representative to Chongqing to resolve this issue, and who you will send as a representative to return to Chongqing with us. We reply specifically and wish you well!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Zhang Zhizhong, Wang Shijie</p>
<p>September 10th</p>
<h3>Report by CCP Representative Lin Zuhan at the Chongqing参政会 (People's Political Council)</h3>
<p>Gentlemen! The Presidium of the National People's Political Council has asked me to report on the negotiations between the National Government, represented by Mr. Zhang Wenbai and Mr. Wang Xueting, and the Central Committee of the CCP, represented by myself. I am very excited about this.</p>
<p>A fair and reasonable adjustment of the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is a very important matter in the current political situation. Not only is this issue of concern to those in the People's Political Council, but the entire nation is also deeply concerned. What I am going to report today is the process of our negotiations with Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang over the past four months. During this process, there were approximately seven important documents, which the Presidium has already distributed to everyone for reference.</p>
<p>Accusation that Chongqing Lacks Sincerity, Negotiations Yield No Results After Four Months</p>
<p>I came from Yan'an with great enthusiasm for these negotiations, hoping to resolve the problems. I was also very pleased to meet Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang unexpectedly in Xi'an. Our negotiations have been conducted in a very friendly atmosphere. Up to now, there is a large difference in our principles. Although our negotiations have not yet reached a final stage, there are still no results to report after four months.</p>
<p>What we are asking of the Kuomintang Central Committee is, firstly, the issue of implementing democratic politics throughout the country. Today, as the Japanese army is deeply invading our territory and the War of Resistance is still at a difficult stage, it is essential that the entire military and civilians unite as one, and that all the people of the country are mobilized. Japan is an industrially developed country with strength. It is waging war within our borders, and we must take this serious situation seriously. China has 450 million people, but they are not united and have not been fully mobilized. Today, there is a very urgent need to unite and mobilize this entire force. What methods should be used to unite the nation's strength and mobilize the nation's power? We believe that democratic politics should be implemented during the war. Only democratic politics can unite all the nation's forces and mobilize all the nation's power to save our nation from disaster. We advocate implementing the Three Principles of the People, strictly adhere to the Outline of National Reconstruction, and the Ten Major Programs proposed by the CCP. If these three major programs are truly implemented, we can unite the strength of the entire nation. Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek said in the early stages of the war, "Regardless of north or south, old or young, everyone has the responsibility to defend the territory and resist the war." Our Party Central Committee advocated implementing democracy, mobilization, and the people from the beginning of the war, achieving a comprehensive and all-people resistance, not just a one-sided war by the government and the military. Our opinion on immediately implementing democracy to enhance national unity and combat strength has been consistent since the war, and this is what we proposed in these negotiations.</p>
<p>The CCP Demands the Expansion of Communist Forces, Recognition of Party and Government</p>
<p>Secondly, from the perspective of the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, we hope to resolve some outstanding issues. These outstanding issues mainly concern the military, political power, and the party. We have been fighting on the front lines for eight years, and the military and political situation has undergone many changes. At the beginning of the war, there were 80,000 Red Army soldiers, but the government only recognized the formation of three divisions, which were ordered to move out, cross the river, and enter Shanxi to fight. We were also given orders by the Supreme Command to organize some guerrilla advance teams to advance to the front lines to fight. From our own perspective, we have done well in difficult battles on the front lines over the years. The Eighteenth Group Army and the New Fourth Army have fought in the provinces of Jin, Ji, Cha, Re, Sui, Yuan, Liao, Lu, Yu, Su, Wan, Zhe, E, and Yue, establishing many popularly elected governments. After more than seven years of fighting, our regular army has increased to 477,500 people, and we have organized 2.2 million militiamen. We request that the government first grant us the designations of five armies and sixteen divisions. At the same time, we have established fifteen base areas in the front lines, where the people have elected their own governments, governing a population of 88 million. We hope that the government will recognize these democratic regimes in the front lines and manage and guide these regimes. In terms of the party, we demand that the government give the CCP an open and legal status, as well as other parties. We hope that the government will lift the military and economic blockade of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, so that personnel and merchants in the border region can have the freedom to move around and travel.</p>
<p>Our party has presented such views to the government and the Kuomintang Central Committee. The National Government once gave us a proposal, and Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang wanted us to handle it according to the Central proposal, but the difference between the two is very large, so that the negotiations have not yielded any results to this day. I will now briefly mention a few major points of divergence for explanation.</p>
<p>First, from the military issue, the regular troops led by the CCP number 477,500 people. Over the past eight years, in an extremely difficult environment, they have persisted in and developed the three major battlefields of North China, Central China, and East China, and have become the vanguard of the future general counter-offensive. In order to prepare for the needs of the counter-offensive, the government should reward it and strengthen it. First of all, it would be reasonable to fully organize 47 divisions. During the Xi'an negotiations, I requested that the government temporarily organize six armies and eighteen divisions. Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang expressed difficulty in accepting this. The proposal of our Party Central Committee on June 4 requested that the numbers of five armies and sixteen divisions be given first, but the government was still unwilling to agree, and only agreed to organize four armies and ten divisions.</p>
<p>In particular, the two measures in the government's proposal, "the remaining troops after reorganization should be cancelled within a time limit" and "the organized troops should be concentrated within a time limit," failed to take into account the needs of the war and the environment of guerrilla warfare. Cancellation within a time limit is equivalent to not wanting the people to resist the war, and returning the recovered areas to the enemy, which is naturally inappropriate.</p>
<p>Next, let us talk about the point of divergence on the popularly elected local governments. The popularly elected governments in the front lines are all of a democratic nature. We request that the government recognize these elected governments in these areas as local governments under its jurisdiction, but the Central proposal calls for their abolition, which is incomprehensible from the perspective of the interests of the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>Once again, regarding the open and legal status of political parties and the protection of the people's freedom of speech, assembly, association, and personal freedom, there has been no improvement in the current situation. Let us cite a few examples to discuss the issue of freedom of speech. The government has expressed that the scale of speech should be relaxed, but in reality, we have fought many battles in the front lines in recent months. These battle reports are submitted to the Military Affairs Department every month, but they have never been published, and when they are sent to the Xinhua Daily, they are also withheld. As for the people's personal freedom, the government announced on August 1 that it would be responsible for implementing protection regulations, but in fact, we have repeatedly requested the release of General Ye Ting. He is neither a Communist Party member, nor did he go to the New Fourth Army on the advice of the government, so he should not be detained. We request the release of Mr. Liao Chengzhi, the son of Mr. Liao Zhongkai, who was arrested after returning to Guangdong after the fall of Hong Kong. In addition, there are many political prisoners imprisoned, and we also request their release, but none of this has been achieved.</p>
<p>The Communist Side Claims to Have Practiced Promises, But Opinions Are Still Far Apart</p>
<p>In addition, Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang also criticized our party in their letters for not implementing the four promises, which also needs to be explained. We held a meeting in Yan'an last December to seriously review this, and the results of the review further prove that our four promises have indeed been fully fulfilled and kept unchanged. For example, taking the first promise: "Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People are essential for China today, and our Party is willing to strive for their complete realization," our implementation of nationalism is manifested in our efforts to fight and respect the equal status of all ethnic groups within the border region. Our implementation of democracy is manifested in the popularly elected governments in the border region and various base areas in the front lines, implementing the "Three-Thirds System" and guaranteeing the people's freedom of speech, assembly, association, personal freedom, and all other freedoms. We are working hard on the production movement, reducing the burden on the people, reducing the public grain from 200,000 dan in the year before last to only 160,000 dan this year. We do not put the entire burden of the public on the people's heads. The second promise: "Cancel all policies of violent insurrection to overthrow the Kuomintang government and the Red Movement, and stop the policy of forcibly confiscating landlords' land," we have adhered to this unchanged for seven years. In the relationship between peasants and landlords, we guarantee the payment of rent and interest on the one hand, and implement rent and interest reduction on the other. We help the development of private industry and develop cooperatives, achieving mutual benefit between the public and private sectors. We have long practiced our promises and have never thought of overthrowing the Kuomintang government. The third promise: "Cancel the current Soviet government, implement democratic politics to seek the unification of national power," this has been truly implemented in various base areas in the front lines. We have not established a separate central government. We only ask the government to recognize the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and the popularly elected governments in the front lines as local governments under its jurisdiction. We are in favor of unification, and China must be unified, but unification must be democratic unification. The fourth promise: "Cancel the name and designation of the Red Army, reorganize it into the National Revolutionary Army, be under the command of the Military Affairs Commission of the National Government, and await orders to move out and assume the reality of fighting on the front lines," we have been implementing this for a long time, and the achievements of our army in fighting hard on the front lines are proof. Our troops have never received a single penny of supplies in recent years, but they still insist on fighting on the front lines and supporting the National Government and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. All these facts are enough to show that we have fulfilled our promises. Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang have criticized us for the lack of independence in legislation and supervision, but we have effectively guaranteed the human rights, property rights, and land rights of people at all levels in the judicial field. We rely entirely on the people to impeach the government, so there are very few cases of corruption and dereliction of duty on our side.</p>
<p>Although the distance between the two sides is still so great, but I can declare again that the Chinese Communist Party has consistently adhered to the policy of uniting to resist Japan and patiently awaits a change in the government's views.</p>
<p>Narrating the Suspension of Negotiations, Pointing Out the Chongqing Side's Distortion of Facts</p>
<p>Now, let me explain the process of negotiating with Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang in Chongqing since Xi'an. Since the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Kuomintang passed a resolution to adopt a political solution to the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, we were very happy when we heard about it in Yan'an and agreed very much. Because since the New Fourth Army incident in 1940, the relationship between the two parties has been very tense. I am a member of the People's Political Council, but I could not come out due to the blockade. We asked the liaison staff officer stationed in Yan'an by the Military Affairs Commission to send a telegram stating that we were willing to come to Chongqing to continue negotiations. After the government replied with consent, I was in charge of border region administration and still needed to arrange spring plowing, so I could not leave until the end of April. In Xi'an, I met with Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang a total of five times. When I first met Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang, I mainly asked how the government's political solution was to be solved? And report to them on the situation in the border area. Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang repeatedly asked me to raise specific issues for discussion. At that time, I proposed using Comrade Zhou Enlai's speech on the birthday of the Father of the Nation on March 12 of this year as the basis for negotiations. Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang did not agree. They proposed discussing military and border region issues first, and I thought it was okay, because I first reported the number of troops under the leadership of the CCP, and asked how many the Central government could agree to organize for us? Mr. Zhang asked me to speak, and I said please give six armies and eighteen divisions first. Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang thought it was too much and only agreed to four armies and twelve divisions. After several consultations, when talking at the last meeting, it was agreed to organize the opinions of both parties in previous meetings into records. Both parties signed and reported to their respective central governments for final decision by the two parties. At that time, I signed on this record first in accordance with our original agreement, but Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang did not sign. The record was a synthesis of the opinions of both parties, and the letter from Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang was only my personal opinion, which was obviously not the truth.</p>
<p>After arriving in Chongqing, the Central Committee of our Party immediately sent a telegram proposing twenty opinions, which I handed over to Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang on May 22, asking them to forward them to the Kuomintang Central Committee. Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang believed that some conditions in the proposal were tantamount to announcing the crimes of the Kuomintang and refused to accept them. In order to respect the opinions of Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang, I asked my Party Central Committee to change the twenty items to twelve items, and the remaining eight items were changed to oral requests, which I handed over to Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang on June 5. At the same time, Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang handed me the government's proposal, but refused to accept and forward the proposal of our Party Central Committee. The dispute continued until June 15, when they replied that they had forwarded it to the government, but the solution was still based on the government's proposal and could not be changed, and the negotiations reached a deadlock.</p>
<p>At that time, Mr. Liang Hancao, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Kuomintang Central Committee, made a statement to foreign reporters saying that the negotiations had stalled and the CCP should be aware of this. On July 2, I published a statement in the Xinhua Daily, expressing that our party's attitude is that we can discuss anything that is conducive to the War of Resistance, unity, and the promotion of democracy. On July 26, Minister Liang published another statement in English that was not in line with the facts. Comrade Zhou Enlai of our Party published a statement on August 13, explaining that the negotiations had not yielded any results and explaining that the responsibility for this matter was not on us. However, our Party Central Committee still hoped that the negotiations could yield results, and sent a telegram inviting Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang to go to Yan'an to continue negotiations. Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang said that this matter could be discussed. The course of the two parties' negotiations is roughly like this.</p>
<p>Attacking Chongqing for Poor Politics, Demanding the Organization of a Coalition Government</p>
<p>Finally, I must declare: The Chinese Communist Party very much hopes to resolve the problem. The opinions we have put forward are correct and reasonable. We hope that the government can proceed from the interests of the War of Resistance, democracy, and unity and accept our reasonable demands. In order for China's War of Resistance to maintain its current glorious international position and achieve lasting peace, we cannot wait for the struggles of our allies, but need to rely more on our own efforts and need to unite and mobilize the strength of the whole country to stop the enemy's offensive and prepare our forces to cooperate with the Allied counter-offensive. We believe that the urgent remedy to save the current military crisis and prepare for the counter-offensive is to quickly change the government's structure, personnel, and policies. The various inquiries from the gentlemen of the People's Political Council in the past few days have also shown that there are many problems with the structure, personnel, and policies of our government, which are not suitable for the needs of the war today. Therefore, I frankly propose that the Kuomintang immediately end its one-party rule, and that the National Government convene representatives from all parties, factions, combat troops, local governments, and people's organizations to hold a national conference and organize a coalition government of all parties to renew the world's eyes and ears, inspire the hearts of the people, encourage the morale of the front lines, so as to strengthen national unity, concentrate national talents, and concentrate national strength.

<h3>Municipal Authorities Determined to Rectify Station Order, Eliminate Illegal Extortion, Eliminate Black Market for Tickets</h3>
<p>The traffic order at the city's North Railway Station has long been chaotic, the black market for tickets is becoming increasingly serious, and the illegal extortion by general scalpers has caused great threat to legitimate travelers. The relevant authorities have held meetings and exhausted their greatest determination to study good strategies to solve this important traffic problem. The municipal authorities have recently, after long consideration and serious review, clearly ordered the establishment of a station police station, determined to correct various places that make it difficult for travelers. A reporter from the Central News Agency believed that all parties placed the greatest expectations on the establishment of the station police station, so they specially visited the relevant authorities to find out about the situation of improving travel that is about to be implemented as follows:</p>
<p>The personnel who are responsible for the execution and management of station order and traffic, and the elimination of various illegal acts for this station police station establishment, have all been hired after long and cautious assessment. All police officers are single and of good character, and will be treated as high as possible to absolutely ensure that they are sufficient to maintain their lives, so that they can exert their work effectiveness and not be tempted by profit to engage in corruption and extortion. Extremely strict methods will be implemented to manage the executing personnel, first seeking to revitalize the police themselves, and resolutely eliminate the scalper parties and scalpers who are parasitic in the station and do evil in the short term. Black market tickets will be eliminated within one month, and legitimate passengers and public officials will be given the greatest convenience in the future. In addition, opinion boxes will be set up in various places in the station so that passengers can report or make suggestions in writing when they encounter difficulties or discover extortion, and it is hoped that they will be reported directly at any time. In short, we must achieve cooperation between officials and the people, and work together to thoroughly eliminate all difficulties for travelers at the station in the shortest possible time. At the same time, at the various docks on the Bund, when ships are in port, there are also many scalpers and hooligans who extort passengers. It is hoped that the authorities will give them the same treatment.</p>

<h3>Public Works Bureau Official Corruption Case: Director Zhang Talks, Internal Investigation Completed, Truth to be Announced</h3>
<p>Regarding the case of the municipal public works bureau officials cutting down trees and selling them, various newspapers have reported on it in recent days. A reporter from the Central News Agency specially visited Zhang Enlin, director of the Public Works Bureau, who made the following statement: "After investigating the case of corruption by members of this bureau, I received a secret report from an official of the Road Section on January 9. I immediately went to the Jungong Road Hongqiao Road area to conduct an on-the-spot investigation and confirmed that there was indeed evidence of tree cutting. Therefore, I secretly submitted the investigation evidence to the Municipal Government on the 11th, requesting that the relevant personnel be suspended from duty and investigated. The Municipal Government has ordered the police to detain and strictly interrogate the relevant criminals. The Bureau is also conducting a detailed and thorough investigation into the case. After the investigation is completed, the truth will be announced." Regarding the other sections published in the Times, Zhang will publicly reply in the next few days.</p>
<h3>Thugs Impersonate, Extort, Arrested and Severely Punished</h3>
<p>The Judicial Section of the Huashan Road Branch Bureau investigated that thugs Jiang Desheng, Lu Yiping, Luo Qian, Zhang Yuanhua, etc., specialize in impersonating the names of the "Local Administration Publishing House" and the "Guanghua Planning Group" to raise donations in Wuxi, Changzhou, Suzhou, and other places, and forcibly publish advertisements in various shops, falsely printing receipts to defraud money, and falsely using the name of "Enriching the Country and Strengthening the Army" to forcibly sell calendars, which is very illegal. Recently, they have become active in Shanghai, and there are many victims. After strict investigation, the above-mentioned criminals have been arrested one after another and dealt with in accordance with the law. It is hoped that citizens will report to the competent branch bureau and arrest and prosecute them if there are any more thugs who impersonate names and extort money.</p>
<h3>Hubei Compatriot Association Continues to Provide Second Scholarship</h3>

During the current winter vacation, it has been decided to continue to prepare the second scholarship. A scholarship committee has been formed separately, and an office has been set up at No. 1 Huichengli, Qingcheng Road (Medan Road), to actively proceed. The notification is from the 19th to the 25th of this month to handle scholarship registration.</p>

Such behavior not only causes unnecessary losses to the public but also damages the reputation of the postal service. If you encounter such situations, you are advised to refuse them outright to prevent the perpetrators from succeeding in their tricks, or even report them to the nearest police station for legal action."</p>

<h3>"Hard Work" Needs Backing</h3>
<p>Hoping Enthusiastic People from All Circles Eagerly Purchase Tickets</p>
<p>The newspaper and *Xin Bao* newspapers' student aid fund, fervently supported by colleagues of "Hard Work", will stage a charity performance of the famous play "Autumn Begonia" at 7:00 PM on the next two evenings. This event was actively prepared by representatives from "Hard Work" and both newspapers, completing arrangements in just four days. Now, the only hope is to ask enthusiastic people from all circles to distribute tickets and contribute to this charitable endeavor. For example, the public letters jointly issued by the authorities of *Shen Bao* and *Xin Bao* in the past two days, attached with numerous "Honor Tickets" worth 5,000 yuan and 10,000 yuan, totaling only two types worth 40,000 and 50,000 yuan, respectively. We urge everyone to purchase them in full or jointly with several people. The ticket fees should be sent to the social service departments of the two newspapers for publication within a few days to reward your kind intentions. The recipients of these letters have been carefully selected, either being prominent figures in Shanghai or reputable figures in industry and commerce. These meager 40,000 to 50,000 yuan are equivalent to ten yuan before the war, which is just a drop in the bucket for the powerful, but it can save three impoverished students from dropping out of school. By watching a famous play, you can also enjoy the reputation of helping students, achieving two goals with one stone. Why not do it? In addition to being concerned about box office sales, the two branches of the Bank of Communications are also assisting in the sale of ordinary tickets worth 500 yuan and 1,000 yuan. We hope that people from all circles will "not forget to help students while being entertained", purchase more tickets, enjoy them with their families, or invite friends to have fun together. It is anticipated that both charity performances will be full, and the ticket revenue will exceed the budget, so as not to disappoint the sincerity of the colleagues of "Hard Work", and also a beautiful act promoted by the public. We respectfully offer our heartfelt prayers for impoverished students!</p>
<p>(Note) People from all circles are very enthusiastic about purchasing "Honor Tickets". Yesterday, we received ticket funds amounting to hundreds of thousands of yuan. The list will be compiled and published simultaneously in *Shen Bao* and *Xin Bao* to show our gratitude.</p>
<p>Donations are Welcomed for Charity Market</p>
<p>Although the Reader's Student Aid Fund has received enthusiastic donations from all walks of life, the tuition fees for the next semester have increased sharply, resulting in insufficient funds for distribution. Therefore, in addition to continuing to raise donations, we have specially joined forces with the *Xin Bao* and the YMCA and YWCA to launch a charity market to help those who have dropped out of school. The target is tentatively set at 10 million yuan. It is hoped that the goods sold will be donated entirely by major companies and manufacturers in the city to benefit the poor, so as to cultivate social talents, and indirectly help the development of China's industry and commerce in the future. The charity market is scheduled to be held at the YMCA at Eight Immortals Bridge on February 15th and 16th. Starting from today, we will begin soliciting items for charity sale. If you would like to donate, please send them to the YMCA at Eight Immortals Bridge or call 84040 for consultation. At that time, shopping in the market will not use cash, but will use vouchers printed by the four groups. The vouchers are divided into four types: 100 yuan, 500 yuan, 1,000 yuan, and 5,000 yuan, which are now openly sold by the two YMCA and YWCA. In addition, in order to encourage the spirit of self-help and helping others, the four groups hereby invite students from major middle schools to voluntarily participate in the solicitation of goods, promotion of vouchers, and service at the venue for the charity market. Students from all schools who are interested in participating in the service are invited to contact the YMCA and YWCA from today.</p>
<p>Birthday Banquet Funds Transferred to Student Aid Fund</p>
<p>A letter from Mr. You Heling of Asia Bread and Candy Factory states: "I am writing to inform you that the 18th of this month is my father's sixty-sixth birthday. Relatives, friends, and acquaintances in the community have all requested to offer their congratulations at the appropriate time. However, my father believes that this is an extraordinary time and does not want to be extravagant. He will not accept gifts or host a banquet, and will donate the money saved from the banquet to the student aid fund. It is both a blessing for the birthday celebrant and a blessing for relatives, friends, and acquaintances. Heling respectfully complies with his father's wishes. Herewith, I enclose national currency 20,000 yuan to donate to the student aid fund, under the name 'Asia Bread and Food Factory Team'. I hope you will accept it."</p>
<p>Health Association Supports Student Aid</p>
<p>A letter from the Chinese Health Association states: "We believe that education is the foundation of a country, and health is the foundation of a career. In response to your newspaper's special appeal for donations, we have decided that all income from outpatient tuberculosis X-ray examinations from the 22nd to the 29th of this month will be used to subsidize the student aid fund. We hope to use this opportunity to implement checkup and tuberculosis prevention work for residents of the city, so that those who believe they are healthy can obtain powerful proof, prevent disease if they are not ill, and obtain early treatment if they are found to be ill, and thus achieve great results. We are extremely grateful."</p>
<p>Money Exchange Colleagues Enthusiastically Raise Donations</p>
<p>A letter from colleagues at Yongyi Money Exchange states: "We, colleagues, are aware that the tuition fees for the next semester are increasing, and the number of students dropping out of school is increasing. With the start of the semester approaching, we read in your newspaper that you are making a special appeal for donations. Therefore, we have specially launched a colleagues' team to raise 60,000 yuan in legal currency, which will be equally distributed to your newspaper and the *Xin Bao* newspaper's student aid fund. Herewith, we send 30,000 yuan, and we hope you will check and accept it."</p>

<h3>Quick Sketch of the "Autumn Begonia" Performance</h3>
<p>— Gong Jia</p>
<p>"Autumn Begonia" is a famous play that has broken all previous box office records. When it was staged at the Carlton Theatre two years ago, it was widely known and caused a sensation, playing for months, which shows how deeply it touched people. This time, the "Hard Work" Drama Troupe re-staged the play to raise funds, and the scene at the entrance of the Lansin Theatre was still crowded with people and horses. The performance was even better than the previous one. I was fortunate enough to participate in the event, and I dare to record the performance in detail for the public.</p>
<p>The cast includes Shen Minzhi, Luo Xiangqi, Shangguan Lingzhu's Mei Bao, Shi Yuan's Zhao Yukun, Bai Wen's Ji Zhaoxiong, Liu Ji's Luo Shaohua, etc., all of whom are among the best of their time. It is especially commendable that Shi Hui and Zhang Fa both played Qiu Haitang before and after. The cast is stronger and more organized than the original cast.</p>
<p>The plot enters a tragic state from the fourth act. In the second scene of the fifth act, when Luo Xiangqi and Mei Bao meet as mother and daughter in the restaurant, Shen Min and Shangguan Lizhu's performance is extremely moving, and many audience members cry uncontrollably.</p>
<p>In the first half, Zhang Fa's Qiu Haitang is played with elegance and loveliness, and in the second half, Shi Hui's performance is desolate and melancholic. The hero is short of breath, and the children are affectionate, which makes people can't help but shed tears of sympathy. The teaching scene received thunderous applause from the audience, and it is no wonder that Zhou Wu was so strange.</p>
<p>Shi Yuan's Zhao Yukun is straightforward and neat, Bai Wen's Ji Zhaoxiong is cunning and sinister, Wang Jun's Xiaogouzi is stupid and silly, Zhuang Yan's mute maid is innocent and cunning, Le Yao's Yuan Baofan is rough and ugly, and Xin An's Shang Laoer is greasy and sour. All the above roles are incisively portrayed and complement each other, making the whole play more colorful.</p>
<p>At the end of the play, the audience applauded enthusiastically, and even some shouted "Bravo!" The audience did not leave until the actors took a bow again and again. At the entrance, I still saw people wiping away tears with handkerchiefs. The appeal of the drama can be seen from this.</p>
<h3>Middle School Basketball League Opens Today</h3>
<p>The Middle School Basketball League, organized by the Sports Department of the YMCA and YWCA, is scheduled to open grandly at 2:00 PM today in the gymnasium of the association at Eight Immortals Bridge. Nineteen middle schools, five women's teams, and seven junior teams will participate in the competition. Because the number of participants in the middle school group has exceeded the quota, it is divided into two divisions, "Middle" and "School". The Middle Division has ten teams, including Fuqun, Guanghua, Zhongli, Qingnian, Jinmou, Huxin Huang, Nanmo, and Hongyi. The School Division has nine teams, including Huxin Lan, Zhonggong, Fanhuang, Gubai, Zhongli Hei, and Huxin Bai. There will be no tickets sold at the time, and visitors are welcome. Today's schedule is as follows: Huxin Bai vs. Gubai (School Division) 2:00 PM, Zhongli Hei vs. Fanhuang (School Division) 2:30 PM, Guanghua vs. Yan Team (Middle School) 3:30 PM, Leye vs. Black and White (School Division) 4:10 PM, Yongfang vs. Xinqie (Junior) 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Sino-Western Boxing Match to be Held Tomorrow Morning</h3>

<h3>Shanghai Judicial Office's Crime Prevention Section Seeking Lyrics for Crime Prevention Songs</h3>

<h3>How to Stabilize Shanghai's Commodity Prices</h3>
<p>— Jiang Lianjun</p>
<p>Over the past year, commodity prices in this city have skyrocketed, business has sharply declined, transportation has been sluggish, all industries have waned, and the people's livelihood has deteriorated to the extreme. The people are the foundation of the nation, and when the foundation is solid, the nation is secure; those who win the people prosper—ancient wisdom makes this clear. Shanghai is the national supply center for goods; how can we allow the situation to continue to worsen, depleting the people's strength and impoverishing their lives? The author will now present a few key points regarding the current critical issues, hoping that the new municipal authorities, who care about the people's welfare, will take them into consideration!</p>
<p>(A) Short-Term Solutions: Thoroughly Inspect All Warehouses in the City: Since last November, the city's Bureau of Economic Affairs, in conjunction with the Economic Security Bureau, has been inspecting major public and private warehouses, focusing on essential daily necessities. 1. Massive stockpiles exceeding the scope of business operations; 2. Products stored for extended periods; 3. Storage by non-industry individuals—all of these practices should be banned. Two months have passed since enforcement began, but during these two months, commodity prices have continued to rise abnormally. The intensity of the price increases is rarely seen even after the incident. Although there are various underlying reasons, the fact remains that speculators are overly optimistic about the warehouse inspections. Those with discerning eyes should not find it difficult to understand the process and its effectiveness. Therefore, in the future, in addition to assigning more dedicated personnel for strict surveillance, the compensation for the inspection personnel should also be increased as much as possible, so they can focus on their duties. Once any transgressions are discovered, the most severe penalties should be imposed in accordance with wartime criminal law. Relying solely on a written notice asking merchants to report any unlawful demands from inspectors is insufficient. It is essential to understand that merchants are likely to be extorted only after they have violated the law. Reporting such extortion would be tantamount to walking into a trap, something even the most foolish would avoid.</p>
<p>Strictly Evaluate and Enforce Price Limits: The price limits promulgated by the Price Evaluation Committee have, in reality, had very little effect in the past. Often, the price limit set yesterday is exceeded in the black market today. If you try to buy a single candle or a bar of soap at the regulated price from any tobacco shop in the city today, you might wear out your iron shoes without finding one! Offer a higher price, and you'll get what you want. Therefore, the current price limits are of no benefit to the people and, in fact, contribute to the black market. In the future, if no price limits are to be set, then so be it. But if price limits are imposed, any instances of exceeding the limit or refusing to sell should not be handled the same way as last year, with just a few days of business suspension. Such penalties are actually welcomed by cunning merchants, as they provide a legitimate excuse to close their doors and wait for prices to rise! Therefore, violators must be immediately taken into custody and prosecuted according to law.</p>
<p>(B) Long-Term Solutions: Quickly Lift Restrictions on Rice Shipments to Shanghai: The rice issue is currently the most serious problem in this city. Recalling the amount of rice allocated per household last year, the total was less than 3.5 *dou* (approx. 35 liters), averaging less than 3 *sheng* (approx. 3 liters) per month. From October to December, after the autumn harvest, the allocation was only 2 *sheng* per month. How can people survive on such a small amount without resorting to the black market? To this day, the general public no longer has high hopes for household rice allocations but hopes that the price of rice is slightly lower. Therefore, we should restore the permit-based transportation system from July and August of last year. The high price of rice in this city affects the cost of general industrial products, and rural commodity prices follow suit, inevitably increasing the cost of agricultural products. This is one reason. Farmers, seeing the high price of rice in Shanghai, have aspirations, which will inevitably make it more difficult to purchase their crops. This is another. Once free transportation is allowed, rice prices should be reduced. To prevent wealthy individuals from hoarding, the following three points may be implemented:</p>
<p>First: Applications for transport permits should be limited to registered rice shops in this city, with a maximum quantity of 500 *shi* (approx. 50,000 liters) per shipment.</p>
<p>Second: After rice shops import rice, they must still sell it to citizens based on ration coupons, with purchases limited to once a month and not exceeding 1.5 *dou* (approx. 15 liters). Smaller amounts are allowed. The price should be calculated based on cost plus a reasonable profit. Furthermore, to encourage competition among merchants, citizens should be allowed to purchase rice freely from any shop using Coupon No. X, regardless of the shop number.</p>
<p>Third: Rice shops must submit a report to the grain management authorities every ten days, detailing the quantity purchased and sold, along with supporting documents. They must also surrender their transport permits.</p>
<p>If the above three points can be implemented, the people's food supply will not be scarce, and rice shops will not have to worry about sitting idle for long. As for household rice, it may be allocated according to the principle of prioritizing essential needs.</p>
<p>To Alleviate the Fuel Crisis, How to Carefully Re-Discuss the Issue of Coal Shipments from North China and Find Ways to Encourage Wholesale Transportation, Providing Convenience Along the Way. This would allow factories in this city equipped with wood-fired engines to continue production, and the fuel needed by citizens would also be supplied steadily.</p>
<p>Ultimately, success depends on human effort. With the current municipal revitalization, we place boundless hope in the new municipal authorities.</p>
<p>The "New Year's Voices" solicited by this newspaper will be published until the 16th of this month as per the regulations. Articles that have not been published will be moved to the National Forum for selection, and remuneration will be calculated according to the National Forum's standards. We hope our contributors will understand.</p>

<h3>New Star Pharmaceutical Factory Donates Medicines; Applications Can Be Made to Various Hospitals</h3>
<p>New Star Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory launched a medicine donation campaign, donating 3 million yuan worth of New Star pharmaceutical products, as previously reported. These medicines have been delivered to the Red Cross First and Third Hospitals, Hongren Hospital, Tongren Second Hospital, Guangsi Hospital, Shanghai Hospital, Shanghai Local Hospital, Shanghai Children's Hospital, Shanghai Factory Union Hospital, Second Hospital, and Shanghai and Xinzha Health Experiment Zone. Furthermore, the procedures for dispensing the medicines have been agreed upon by the hospitals and are very simple. Wage earners in the industrial and commercial sectors, scientific and technical personnel in academic institutions, teachers at all levels of schools, students on loan from the Shen Xin Two Newspapers, and the direct family members of the above four categories who are in poor financial condition and work diligently can all request from the above hospitals. With a prescription from the attending physician of each hospital, signed by the hospital director or service department, they can receive the medicines at the hospital, saving patients the trouble of traveling back and forth.

<p>Since moving into its new building on Shanxi Road last year, Hua An Bank's business has been thriving. The bank has always been committed to serving society. Considering the general financial difficulties of outstanding male students and impoverished citizens unable to make a living in these extraordinary times, the bank has raised 2 million yuan, half of which will be used for student aid and half for small loans. The student aid is continuous, with the bank allocating 1 million yuan each semester to cover the entire tuition and fees of each student during the semester, but temporarily limited to 30 male high school and junior high school students. The small loans are divided into three categories: 3,000, 6,000, and 9,000, with detailed regulations. Those wishing to apply for the above aid can visit the bank at 54 Shanxi Road, starting Monday, the 22nd of this month, from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM daily, to collect application forms. Applicants for student aid must also bring their most recent academic report cards for review to determine eligibility. Notification will be given within five days, and the procedures are simple. The above two charitable initiatives are entirely borne by the bank and do not involve external fundraising.</p>

<h3>Children's Welfare Association Fundraising Still Short by Two Million</h3>
<p>According to the Chinese Children's Welfare Association, the association recently received continued donations from all walks of life, totaling 283,900 yuan, including 142,000 yuan further raised by Yang Pengnian, General Manager of Datong Enterprise Bank, and 80,000 yuan raised by Song Futing, Manager of Zhengtai Bank. Mr. Yang, an Executive Committee member of the association, has raised a total of 1,123,070 yuan and is still working hard to promote it. His deep concern for association affairs and his care for children are evident. In addition, Ding Boxiong, a standing committee member of the association, has been assisting in the planning of this fundraising campaign and has devoted much effort to it. He had pledged to raise 500,000 yuan, but due to the recent sharp rise in prices, the association's expenses have been enormous, far exceeding the original budget. Therefore, he has increased his pledged amount to 1 million yuan. Currently, the association has received donations exceeding 7 million yuan, plus the 1 million yuan pledged by Standing Committee Member Ding, totaling 8 million yuan. However, it is still 2 million yuan short of the 10 million yuan goal. We still hope that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will continue to generously donate large sums to contribute to this grand cause.</p>
