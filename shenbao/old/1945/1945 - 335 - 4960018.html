<h3>杜魯門期望馬歇爾　促使中國團結合作</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓七日電〕杜魯門總統今日表示，渠希望駐華特使馬歇爾將軍此行，能促使中國政黨團結合作。總統在記者招待會時聲稱：關於給予新任特使之指示，現當無機會與國務卿貝爾納斯商談。詢及赫爾利准將指責副國務卿艾其森曾損害在伊朗之美國外交政策時，杜魯門謂渠認爲案情並非如此。總統並訓渠在最近期內將咨文國會，請求批准貸款與英國四十四萬萬元。杜魯門同時表示蘇聯要求美國貸款六十二萬萬元一事，渠尙未接得此種請求。總統又宣布在最短期內，渠將發表委員，調查巴勒斯坦之局勢。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓七日專電〕馬歇爾元帥仍出席珍珠港事件調查委員會作證，離美日期尙未悉。</p>
<p>〔中央社東京八日專電〕麥克阿瑟總部稱：麥帥昨曾與魏德邁將軍，巴貝將軍，及第五艦隊司令陶威爾斯會談，將向美參謀長聯席會議，提出建議。</p>
<h3>貝爾納斯公開聲明　美對華政策目標　發展一堅强統一民主中國</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓八日電〕美國國務卿貝爾納斯，在外交委員會發表的演說，全文如下：</p>
<p>在戰爭期間，美國對華的主要目標，就是促進各政治團體的軍事統一，因而可以把它們的聯合力量，加諸我們的共同敵人日本。我們較遠的目標，就是發展一個堅强統一民主的中國，這個目標，當時和現在一樣，並且至少有同樣重要性的。</p>
<p>爲了達成這個較還的目標，中國中央政府，以及各黨各派必須開誠佈公，用妥協辦法，來解決各項爭議。我們相信猶如我們一向相信一向堅持的一樣，蔣委員長的政府提供了發展民主最滿意的基礎。但是，我們也相信這個政府必須予以擴充，容納範圍廣大組織良好而至今在中國政府中尙無發言權的一切團體的代表。</p>
<p>問題的解決，主要靠中國領袖們本身的誠心善意。假如把我們的勢力作爲一種因素，那麼成功與否，端視我們怎樣運用這種勢力去鼓勵中央政府，所謂共產黨和其他黨派互作讓步。</p>
<p>我們正式承認的祗有國民政府，我們的大使是駐國民政府的大使。我們的軍用供應品和經濟援助，一向是祗交給國民政府的。在開羅會議中代表中國的是蔣委員長。在舊金山會議中，簽字於聯合國憲章的，是國民政府的外交部長。批准憲章的是國民政府。出席外長會議的是國民政的府外交部長。</p>
<p>在最近幾星期中，我國軍隊之必須留駐中國，已經成爲美國民衆關心的原因，這一點是可以想得到的。因此，這個問題在我和報界的會晤中，時常被提出來。我已經說得極淸楚，就是我國在華軍隊的唯一目的，乃是按照協約國最高總司令的命令，便於使大量日軍向國民政府軍隊投降。</p>
<p>這些是我們承認蔣委員長政府是中國合法政府的許多公開證據中的幾個。</p>
<p>赫爾利將軍在本委員會所說我和總統拒絕答應他發表這樣一個公開聲明的請求，使我不得不補充幾句話。我們可以向各位說，在國務院所保存的一切文件中，我從沒有知道大使曾經提出過這樣的請求。此外，他自從九月間返國後，和總統進行幾次談話時，當時我也在塲，我沒有聽到他提出這個請求。</p>
<p>我與艾其森或謝偉思，並不相知，但因赫爾利大使提出了對於他們二人的特殊批評，我才獲讀了艾其森本年二月廿八日的電文，和謝偉思去年十月十日的備忘錄。這兩種文件，在赫爾利看來，似乎是可以引爲他們阻撓完成美國對華目標之堅强證據的。</p>
<p>艾其森電文是否適當，當視該電文發出以前的中國事態的背景以爲斷。正如前任的高斯大使一樣。赫爾利大使曾致力於促成團結的工作，不僅要使國民政府與所謂共黨，並且要使國民政府與其他反對派促成團結。本年二月十九日，赫爾利大使離偷返美之際，他告訴我說，國共間的談判，差不多已經瀕於決裂。</p>
<p>當赫爾利大使離開重慶後，大使一職，就由艾其森顧問自動代理。二月廿八日，—即赫爾利離渝後九日，抵華府前三日—據國務院的記錄，艾其森發出電文，即在那一天。他在這個電文中，具體地把他對於富時劇變中的中國情勢，作了廣泛而深刻的分析。電文結論中說：爲了適應環境的激變，我們必須把美國當前的策略予以調整。該電文又極明確地申言：本問題的最適宜的討論時機，當俟魏德邁將軍和赫爾利在華盛噸時提出解決。</p>
<p>自從九月份以來，我們一向都依賴駐華大使飽人員的報告，艾其森二月二十八日的一封電報，就是關於目前中國局勢的一個完備而自由的報告。他的建議，的確是一種正直的努力，去帮助國務院規定對華的未來政策，而絕無什麼可以表示他是企圖欺瞞他的上司。相反的，這封電報很着重的提出建議，認爲關於這件事情，應向赫爾利探取意見。謝偉思的行動，是一九四四年十月十日備忘錄的一種準備，關於這點，赫爾利曾在他與本人談話中提及，本人也很謹愼的審閱過這備忘錄。當謝偉思草擬此項備忘錄時，他並未在重慶大使館工作，雖然他依然保持着外交人員的地位。他祗是史迪咸將軍駐延安的政治觀察員。在那時候，他是屬於史迪成而不是大使館。在那時候，赫爾利是以大使的身份担任總統駐華的私人代表，但是他並不是美國的駐華大使，他並不是重慶美國大使館的負責者。在這種情形之下，我們可以說：謝偉思所寫的並不媾成對赫爾利的不服從。這備忘錄的本身建議，根本變更美國對中國中央政府的政策，內容語調强硬，結論也相富激烈。</p>
<p>這建議是寫給史迪威的，同時也送達重慶大使館。大使館把建議送交國務院，而並未贊同它的結論，但加以註解，聲明這種建議，祗代表一個政治觀察家的意見。</p>
<p>當這註解的備忘錄送達國務院的時候，立被轉交中國事務組，在沒有進一步流通以前，中國事務組又附上另一備忘錄，堅決言明許多結論都不確實。這裏面並沒有可以證明艾其森和謝偉思兩人是有些微不忠於他的上司。事實上，他們祗是在正當辦法下，對上司表示若干與量時政府政策不同之意見而已。</p>
<p>赫爾利大使的另一指摘。就是若干官員或僱員，不僅是對上司表示意見，並且曾向某種與共黨有來往的人表示說：大使並未準確的代表美國立塲。這種行爲，當然是罪無可逭，本人將首先處罰及開除犯這種罪的官員。但是赫爾利大使並沒有向本人或本委員會提出任何證據，去指明任何僱員已犯有此罪。凡是對政府忠於服務的人，絕不能因爲某一私人的猜疑而被開除，因而在名譽上蒙受重大損失。本人不願聽見有任何國務院官員，因爲畏懼開罪本院另一人，而避免用正當方法，提出正直的報告和建議。　使有這一天，那末本人將會失去一切足以爲本人順利執行重大職務的協助和引導。</p>

<h3>收復區接收處理情况　翁文灝在參政會駐會委會報吿</h3>
<p>就實際情形互相比較，日本經營規模之大，成功之中，華中尙遠不如華北。華北開發公司資金總額日金五億元，發行債券十五億餘元，准發社債三十餘億元，債券之還本付息，均由日本政府担保，該公司總社在日本東京，分社設北平及張家口，事務所設天津·靑島·濟南·太原等處，其中以北平組織最為完備。華北開發公司投資之重要事業，擇要言之，為華北交通公司，資本僞聯銀券四億元，華北電訊電話公司，資本一億元，華北電業公司，資本三億元，大同煤業公司，資本一億二千萬元，華北製鐵會社，資本一億元。又投資設立山東礦業公司，井陘·磁縣·焦作·中興·大汶口·新泰·柳泉·山西·大靑山各煤業公司或會社，華北石炭販賣公司，華北礬土公司，輕金屬公司，鹽業公司，電化公司，化學　業會社，窒素肥料社，纖維統制總會，山西產業會社，蒙藏電業會社，礦產販賣會社等等事業組織。其已成事業有可注意者，例如電力方面，日人在北平新設發電六萬瓩電廠，在天津新設發電五萬旺電廠，在唐山煤業附近新設發電五萬瓩電廠並已設長途傳電綫路，將此極重要之三處電力，聯成一網，雖設備之一部份尙特繼續完成，但此電力聯貫辦法，增多力量，減少成本，實最合近代電力之原則，爲吾國新式動力之模範。日本方面深認華北資源豐富，有發展大規模電力之需要，故在戰時已由電力專家策劃黃河水力發電廠，自河曲以下至孟津，共設八站，共能發電五百十七萬瓩，滹沱河及永定河亦可水力發電，且以爲惟其上流設壩攔水調節河流，方能使下游河水確循常軌，而免氾濫與　積，可見此項計劃，對於北方民生所關甚鉅。紡織方面，日人對於各項品質試騐頗多，因知煤焦，烟煤，除開灤·井陘·磁縣·博山以外，蕪萊·新泰亦極有價値，大同烟煤，雖須配合，方能煉焦，但質高量豐，極可重視。煉鐵廠日人以北平·靑島及唐山三處爲中心，但煉鋼軌鋼則尙未實行。建設山柬礬土，日人擬用以製成鋁養，在南定設廠，大部告成，以鋁養運往日本製鋁，由此諸例，可見日本方針側重在吾國生產，僅及原料或半製品，而此其最後精製部份，以成實地有用之產品，則留歸日本本土，此種控制殖民地政策，原爲日人所重視。關於交通方面者，天津爲華北要港，而大沽口淤積加多，本年夏間僅深四尺，爲大津前途計，至可憂慮，日人爲改良計，另鑿運河，通至塘沽，使渠水加深，港地加固，實爲創立北方大港之要策，具有繼續完成之價値。綜觀日人在　　華北及華中所用方法，極重採取集中組織與大規模經營，良以集中則力量加大，效率加高，大規模經營，則產量加多，成本减少，此原爲近代化經營事業應有之方向，甚可爲吾國此後推進之借鏡。（續完）</p>

<h3>星期論壇　原子能與中國之前途</h3>
<p>— 趙曾玨</p>
<p>一　原子彈之重要性</p>
<p>原子彈動員了美英加三國最優秀的科學家。兩枚原子彈燬滅了日本廣島和長崎兩倘大城，促成了日本的瓦解。原子彈使蘇聯疑懼不安，使英美領袖僕僕風塵商討不已。原子彈使美國國會要組織特別委員會來研究處置的方法，使聯合國會議要組織專門委員會來處理保管的方式。原子彈改變了以後的戰術，震動到世界每一個角落，開啓了科學的新時代，百年來控制世界動力泉源的石油和煤的地位，很可能被原子能取而代之，而發生動搖。總之，自從第一杪原子彈落到廣島以後，二十世紀已踏進原子新時代的大門，整個世界的政治，軍事，工業和生活方式，也許不久要從比改觀。原子彈不但開闢了世界的新紀元，也可代表世界科學進步的綜合的結晶！</p>
<p>二　原子彈簡史</p>
<p>要談到原子彈的歷史，不得不追溯到放射性原子的發現和研究。地球上放射性原子，已經發現的有鈾（Uranium）釷（Thorium），鏷（Polonium），鐳（Radium），氭（Radon），還有其他的許多種，都自動有連續放射性。事實上其他本來不放射的元素，經放射元素打　　、也可　　　射　　，其中鈾和鐳是最重要的。現在原子彈所用的鈾，發現最早，爲遠在一八九六年一位法國科學家Becquerle所發現。後來因爲大家注意力集中在鐳的研究，以致鈾隱姓埋名了好多年。</p>
<p>各種放射性元子，都不十分穩定，其原子核本來由一定數量的若干陽性質子，陰性電子，和中和性中子所組成。（一般認爲中子即是質子和電子的密切結合體。）但是因爲放射X線（四個質子兩個電子所成的射線）和B線（電子射線），原子核逐漸减輕，便成各種同位素，如鐳有R-226　R-224　R-206等，鈾有U-238　U-235　U-234等。據一般科學家的意見，以爲鐳實從鈾的連續蛻變而成，而鈾亦可蛻變成鋁，一切較重的元素，都可蛻變成較輕的元素。</p>
<p>鈿在放射的時候，四週的溫度每比室溫的高四五度，這是放射能力的一種。大槪一克鈿全部放射可生三十萬加路里（Calorie）的熱量。各種放射性物質都繼續散失能力，分成射綫·熱力和光，每克物質所含能力約有九下加二十個圈安格（ergs）的能力。但放射的時間很長，如鐳要三千二百年，鈾要九十二萬萬年。每一單位時間內所放射的能力不多。但鐳的所以能治癌，便因它的射綫能破壞細胞組織，所以用時必須十分審　　　傷人體，其力量已很可觀。倘使把長　　射的　一且完全發出，其能力便大得驚人，其破壞性也可想而知。</p>
<p>科學家因爲要利用這鉅大的能力，同時想把元素加速蛻變，便設法把原子擊破，使積蓄在原子核內的位能立刻變成動能。其所以採用鈿的原因，因爲中鈿（U-235）是很不穩定比較容易擊破，而鉀的產量也比較豐富，約一百萬倍於鐳。各國對於這種研究已經十年以上，原來的動機當然想利用這元盡藏的動力泉源來代替日漸枯竭的煤和油。不幸大戰爆發，於是原子彈應運而生，先工業應用而出現了。據推算，一磅中鈾可抵TNT炸藥一萬五千噸。問題是要大量提煉中鈿。</p>
<p>當一九四〇年英國風雨飄搖的時候，英國科學家對於原子彈的研究已有相當把握，於是便和美國商量，把這批科學家移到比較安全的美國，利用美國的科學設備和加拿大大熊湖豐富的鈾，繼續研究，結果趕上了軸心國，首先發明原子彈。</p>
<p>據聞原子彈的研究製造，共用去二十萬萬美金，動員工人六萬五千名。其中吾國有一位女科學家吳健雄博士，曾得諾貝爾獎之勞倫斯氏研究，間接有不少貢獻。當第一次試騐時，主持人深恐該項放射能將使空氣中氮和氣大量地結合，而發生世界上氣不足的影響，試騐結果，並不如此，這恐懼也就消失。原子彈的效果，不但發生鉅大的爆炸力，一枚原子彈相當二萬噸的炸藥，使地　建築　　　　　，　使一切生物內部的組鐵破裂。</p>
<p>三　原子　之</p>
<p>原子彈的出現，壓倒了一切其他軍器，整個的戰術將大大改觀。一個國家，祗須有小量的空軍，帶着原子彈，夜襲另一國家，這被襲的便可立刻陷於悲慘絕望之境，一切工廠和動植物都燬了，交通和生產全部停頓，坦克車成爲碎片，大砲化爲灰塵，鋼甲的艦隊也如紙船一般的無用，强大的軍隊立刻孤立無助，一切的一切都完了。總之，先下手爲强，一個原子彈可使敵國陷入萬刼不復之境。</p>
<p>原子彈的破壞性旣如此之大，現在世界上尙未有適當的防禦方法，倘使這原子彈入於侵略者之手，則世界將永無寗日。於是舉世惶惶，或要求宣佈這秘密，或企求適當的保管。我國的立塲，如果這秘密能由美國永遠保守下去，也未嘗不可，因爲她不是用來侵略，而是用來保障和平的。但是能不能永久保守秘密，很成問題。科學的進步，永無止境，有志於科學的國家對於這秘密的發現不過是時間問題。所謂管理，祗能暫時保持先進國對於原子炸彈製造方法的秘密，但是不能阻止科學努力國家之研究與成功！</p>
<p>原子能用於工業，不久當可實現。據說，如果把一小塊中鈾放在盛水的櫃中，便不斷有大量的水蒸氣發生，比用其他燃料所得的要持久而便宜。所未能解決的，僅是如何處理中鈾時不生危險，如何取得像汽油或煤一樣價廉的中鉀，以及是否可以利用其他豐富而賤的原子能而已。我們知道，英國所以有現在的富强，因爲她首先工業化；美國所以有現在的富强，因爲她首先大量生產化。所以任何國家能首先把原子能實用於工業，也就在富强的路上着了先鞭，這也是其他國家要求公開原子　秘密的一個原因吧。　〔下文轉入第二版〕</p>

<h3>侵華禍首　近衛罪不容誅</h3>
<p>曾利用太平洋學會　推行國際宣傳計劃</p>
<p>〔中央社東京七日電〕昨夜麥帥下令逮捕以戰犯待審之近衛文　，據聞曾利用著名之太平洋學會日本分會機構，在九一八事變與太平洋戰爭間一段重要時期中，從事大規模之國際宣傳計劃。近衛以其親信之「智囊團」之人物置於要津，以取得對於太平洋學會日本分會之控制權。所謂智囊團中有鶴見祐輔及牛塲等。在近衛三任首相期中，日本曾有三次最重要之國策決定，以致引起太平洋戰爭之爆發，是時牛塲即任首相之私人秘書及太平洋學會日分會之主任秘書。故在近衛任首相之一段有歷史意義之時期中，太平洋學會日分會與日內閣間，具有極密切之聯繫。太平洋學會日分會之經費，係通過與近衛具有密切關係之西園寺公望（已故元老）由工商界捐款而來。近衛復以西園寺公望之孫西園寺公一，爲太平洋學會日分會之秘書，三菱三井等公司亦均曾捐款。近衛經過太平洋學會之聯繫得與許多具有聲望之訪問日本者接觸。自日本侵略東北開始後，近衛任東京商科大學校長，上田貞次郎氏撰寫篇幅極巨之報告，解釋「日本感受人口壓迫」之理論。一九三六年底世界太平洋學會於加利福尼亞開會時，太平洋學會日分會遂將上田氏之報告，向大會提出，竟使許多世界經濟學家相信日本之對外擴展，爲自然而合理之趨勢。及至「中國事件」開始，演變而走向戰爭之時，近衛又派遣西園寺公一爲其特使前往中國，表面似為試探和平有無可能，實則係又偵察中國領袖對於抗戰之準備，已達何　程度。渠興宋子文會商，返國後，　向政府報告中國已準備長期抗虞，並警告日政府應派遺大批軍隊，始能早日結束中國事件。近衛顯然立即決定派遣大批軍隊，於是戰爭　行爆發。</p>

<h3>星期論壇　原子能與中國之前途</h3>
<p>— 趙會珏</p>
<p>（由第一版轉來）</p>
<p>四　我國應研究原子能</p>
<p>我國是科學落後的國家，國父曾經大聲疾呼，要求國民迎頭趕上；但是到目前爲止，我們究竟趕上了多少？是不是迎頭的趕？要講到趕，今後對於科學就非得多多努力人人努力不可！要謂到迎頭，今後更須對原子能的秘密號召全國優秀科學家去研究！研究放射的物理事如上述的吳女士亦應召回，專設學院作有計劃的研究。這一研究的重要，也可分軍事與工業兩方面　。</p>
<p>我國軍器製造，本來落後，即使急起直追，也不是短期間能與列國並肩的，但是原子彈占着軍器中最重要部份，如能研究自造，則軍器落後的嚴重性也得减轉。今後倘使不能自製原子彈，可以說是沒有國防。在現在世界大同沒有實現的今日，實在是非常危險，而且危險性是與日俱增的。這並不是說除了原子彈以外，其餘不必再求深造。譬如飛機也是投擲原子彈的必需品，而其他軍器也是維持治安，持久作戰所不可缺的。但要列於四强之一，維持世界的和平，舉足輕重，則非對於原子彈有自行製造的能力不爲功。</p>
<p>至於工業方面，我國雖則號稱地大物博，實在是地瘠民貧。動力泉源的煤，雖說徧佈各省，然而分佈之廣未必就是蘊藏之富，據調查所得，貯藏量僅佔世界總額的百分之六。至於石油的儲量，更微不足道，將來是否能有新發現很是問題。這樣貧乏的動力泉源要想發展鉅大工業，比較困難。但是有了價値低廉，取之不盡用之不竭的原子能，則工業的發展大有希望。更有其他各種工業原料，我國生產也並不完全，倘使能用原子能來蛻變物實，則驟料缺乏的問題，也得迎刃而解。</p>
<p>最近美國又發明從氫取得原子能。（或則是含有二個質子的重氫。）又聞正研究利用宇宙光來擊破原子核。總之，現在原子科學也不過方才開始，進步之途尙查無止境，及早趕上，尙不爲遲。這一最重大的問題，希望國家多多培植科學家，而科學家也當孳孳研究，不斷努力，不要故步自封。百尺竿頭，更進一步，使我國在世界原子科學上得占一地位才好。我國經八年苦戰，犧牲了多少生命財產，犧牲了多少人民的幸福，好容易把國際地位提高。現在的地位，倘使科學家不能在原子能研究上迎頭趕上，必不能維持强國的地位。所以我國必須迎頭趕上，研究原子能，以求自强，幷以維持世界和平。願與國人共勉之。</p>

<h3>敎育部長朱家驊報吿　敵修改敎科書　圖施奴化敎育</h3>
<p>中小學生曲予諒宥　甄審着重思　考察</p>
<p>〔本報重慶航訊〕敎育部長朱家驊氏，日前條該部會議室，舉行記者招待會，即席報告其視察收復區敎育觀感稱：</p>
<p>傾向祖國</p>
<p>收復區多數敎職員及學生，在敵寇八年控制之下，身體雖失去自由，精神仍熱烈傾向祖國，敵人雖費盡心機，修改各級敎科書，圖施奴化教育，但結果毫未收效。淪陷區各學校，每晨照例須縣升偽旗，但除受監視迫不得已而奉行者外，多以校旗代替。渠深覺抗戰八年中，國土雖淪陷，精神則未嘗淪陷。且淪陷區大多數知識分子，猶不斷執行心理上之抗戰。</p>
<p>中途折回</p>
<p>惜因事實上亦困難殊多，各地學校，無法內遷，少數專科以上學校於內遷旅途中爲經費所阻，不得不中途折回，精神至堪欽佩。基於上述情形，對收復區敎育之整頓，除依照全國教育善後復員會議決議案外，其如何能使之合理化，尙待詳細研究。對於甘心附逆，出賣祖國之敎授或學生，經有確實證據者，仍常予以嚴厲懲處，渠已於此次視察時，詳細調查，並特別側重敎職員及專科以上學校之敎授及學生。</p>
<p>照常上課</p>
<p>至中學及小學生，則有「曲予諒宥」之必要，蓋現在之中學生，戰時尙爲小學生，現在小學生，則尙在稚齡，根本尙無個人自由。此點亦甚盼能促起各界之注意。南京，上海，杭州，天津，北平等地中小學校，均仍令照常上課。專科以上學校，則均先後設立臨時大學補習班，各理均由敎部特派員主持。敎授方面，暫由特派員臨時徵用，大部係原來任敎淪陷區學校者，惟此僅係臨時性質。</p>
<p>甄審辦法</p>
<p>將來學生之甄審辦法，將特別着重思想之考察，其次補習課程，在七十五分以上者，（包括總理遺敎，黨義，總裁思想，基本課程，必修踝程等）得予分發各公私立大學，六十分以上得自由投考各私立大學，惟學程須降低一年，俾能與內地學生程度，求得平衡。</p>

<p>排球—三時半開始，震旦以兩個十五對一，連勝二局。</p>
<h3>敎育經費</h3>
<p>— 胡先</p>
<p>任何良好之敎育計畫，無經費不能使之實現。在此抗戰之八年中，政府深知敎育之重要，而又困於經費之缺乏，遂師巧婦之故智，而爲無米之炊。以通貨膨脹之故，今日各學校之經費，不及戰前原有經費百分之一，且抱定粗製濫造之宗旨，着手增設大量之新學校，從不計及此種粗製濫造之敎育之貽害至若何程度，名爲給與靑年以敎育機會，實則貽誤靑年不知紀極，此舉辦敎育而不能籌措充分之經費之弊害也。</p>
<p>然在抗戰期中，尙有可說。戰事結束以後，旣昌言建國，則必須儘量寬籌敎育經費，敎育始能漸返正軌，而不至仍蹈粗製濫造之覆轍，須知今日爲達成實業計畫，養成各級幹部人才，及普及國民敎育，與養成所必需之各級學校之敎師與地方自治人員計，學校之增加，必須百倍於今日，而經費尤須千萬倍於今日。</p>
<p>政府當局必須深切認明，在今後建國之過程中，擴充敎育之重要，決不在完成實業計畫之下，而欲擴充敎育，則必須儘量增加敎育經費也。我國俗諺有云：「敎子不留田半畝」，具見國人了知敎育之重要，政府亦須了知爲達成各種國策計，對於擴充敎育，及寬籌教育之經費，必須有類似之決心也。</p>

<h3>第一部印度影片問世</h3>
<p>— 小隼</p>
<p>（成都航訊）：第一部印度影片『達茜』（Dassi），最近已由空運抵達成都，自本月中旬起，在『國民大戲院』獻映。</p>
<p>『達西』（在成都開映時譯名『遙寄相思雁歸來』）是一張十足的印度影片，各項的技術工作，完全由印人担任。這部影片，是最近成立的第一家印度製片公司『台芙影片公司』的處女作，根據近代印度作家潘巧利的小說原作改編而成，由印人希侖蒲斯導演。主演的三大印度明星，是金嗓子女歌星蘭琪妮，小生那傑姆，以及男星琪亞尼。全片穿插着不少的音樂和歌曲，也完全是純粹的印度風味。祇是對白却用的是英語，但在印度本國，另製有印語對白的拷貝。</p>
<p>還有一點特色，那便是故事的奇特與神秘，充滿了東方的哲理氣氛，加上對於那不可捉摸的『命運』之奇幻的觀念，這在看慣了簡潔明朗的美國電影故事的我們，也許會有點『莫名其妙』之感。它描寫一對由愛人而結成夫婦的少年男女，在十餘年中受盡命運的播弄。由突然的懈逅而發生波折，再由波折而結合，由結合而另生不幸，以至勞燕分　，一別十載。最後，更由於另一個突然的機絑而重行聚首。全片自始至終，貫串着一種不可解的神秘意味。</p>
<p>合芙影片公司的成立，還是今年六月間的事。</p>
<h3>彈詞中的付丑</h3>
<p>— 健帆</p>
<p>戲劇中的丑角，發語冷雋，動作趣妙，最易引人發笑。彈詞脫胎崑曲，除唱詞外，描摹書中人物的神情動作，以及對自，完全和演劇無異。所不同的：乃是一人兼去數角，並不化裝扮飾，由說書人參加表白，說明書中故事。至狀書中人出塲，術語呌做：『起脚色』；對於製造笑料的付丑，更爲注重。所謂付角，又稱二面，就是平劇中的方巾丑。大都是居心叵測，爾處我詐的奸徒，趨炎附勢，脅肩謟笑的帮閒門客，以及玩世不恭，別有懷抱的人物。小丑又名小花面，强半描慕下層社會的阪夫走卒，雞鳴狗盜之流。雖是前代故事，可是比照現社會的形形色色，還覺得非常親切，是一種强有力的諷刺。說書人稱插科打諢呌做：「放噱頭』。一個彈詞家須說，噱，彈，唱，四字佔全，才算十全十美。「噱』在『說』之下，足見也很重要。所有噱頭，幾乎全由付丑二角製造出來，因此書壇上的響檔彈詞家，莫不善去付丑。若要吐屬名雋，語氣幽默，就非深研崑曲，巧於變化不可。再加說書人的表白，也須有濃厚的小丑化，方覺滑稽突梯，耐人尋味。一個大時代的轉變，諸色人等儘有許多奇妙的怪事，足供說書人在『將古比今』的噱頭中，作深刻的煊染。舊的戲劇和彈詞，雖說離去時代太遠，但有反映社會的表現。最大的力量，乃是諷世。可惜眞能諷世的彈詞家，確是不可多得啊。</p>

<h3>提高遊藝的水準</h3>
<p>— 張冶兒</p>
<p>前在歡迎張道藩先生的席間，我說過：「我們游藝界同人得不到社會上的重視，爲的是藝術幼稚，學識淺陋，與一般文化和藝術各界的水準不能平衡，這是我們不能否認的！」因此，我代表遊藝界大聲疾呼的要求各界光進來隨時指導和提携！</p>
<p>不過凡事要人家來帮助是不可靠的，還是要靠着自己，游藝界應分別先從自身團結起來，本着學無止境之旨，互相研求藝術的進步，隨着時代的演進，生活須要自肅，而革除一切惡習慣，要知道游藝雖是一種娛樂，並不是專供人們消遣而已！記得抗戰前社會局潘公展局長曾勉勵我們說：「戲劇是通俗敎育的一種，演劇人員是深入民間的社會導師。」我們實在慚愧，常不起這名義；負不起這重任！但又不能不勉力擔負這重大的使命！所以同志們雖不敢目尊自貴；最低限度亦不能自暴自棄！必須爲我們遊藝界爭一口氣，努力向上，修養自已的人格；提高遊藝的水準！</p>

<p>當他走進那美國人睡着的那間房裏去時，他除了理智以外，不許他的心境有其他存在。可是常他開開門來時，他吃驚地看見那年輕的人已經起了床，而且正預備到花園裏去。</p>
<p>他驚呼道：『怎麼！誰允許你離開這間房間的？』</p>

<p>貞雄驚奇地問道：『眞的嗎？』他忘了一切。『我想我好像曾預防過這個現象的，』他喃喃說道。他拉起了這人的衣服，注視着那正在瘉合的創痕。他說：『如果運動不能治好的話，也許可以用按摩。』</p>
<p>那年輕人說：『這樣對我並沒有什麼妨礙。』他那長着粗硬的黃鬍子的年輕的臉是憔悴的。『哦，醫生，我有幾句話要和你講。如果我沒有碰到一個像你這樣的日本人的話——那我是不會活到今天的，我知道。』</p>
<p>貞雄鞠了一躬，沒有講話。</p>
<p>『眞的，我知道，』湯姆繼續熱烈地說。他那抓着一張椅子的大而瘦的手，指節都白了。『我猜如果所有的日本人都像你一樣，這戰爭就不會發生了。』</p>
<p>貞雄艱難地說：『也許是吧。我想你現在可以去睡了。』</p>
<p>他扶那孩子睡下後，鞠躬說：『晚安。』</p>
<p>貞雄這天晚上睡得很不好。他屢次醒來，以爲他聽見了脚步聲，一枝樹枝的折斷聲，或是花園裘一塊石塊的移動聲——都是背着東西的人所能造成的聲音。</p>

<h3>Truman Hopes Marshall Will Facilitate Unity and Cooperation in China</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 7th] President Truman stated today that he hopes General Marshall's mission to China will facilitate unity and cooperation among Chinese political parties. The President stated at a press conference that there would be no opportunity to consult with Secretary of State Byrnes regarding instructions for the newly appointed special envoy. Asked about Brigadier General Hurley's accusation that Undersecretary of State Acheson had undermined American foreign policy in Iran, Truman said he did not believe the case to be so. The President also instructed that he would soon send a message to Congress requesting approval of a loan of $4.4 billion to Britain. Truman also stated that he had not yet received a request from the Soviet Union for a loan of $6.2 billion from the United States. The President also announced that he would appoint a committee in the near future to investigate the situation in Palestine.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 7th Dispatch] Marshal Marshall is still testifying before the Pearl Harbor Incident Investigation Committee and his departure date from the United States is not yet known.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 8th Dispatch] MacArthur's headquarters stated: MacArthur met yesterday with General Wedemeyer, General Baber, and Fifth Fleet Commander Towers to formulate recommendations to the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>
<h3>Byrnes Publicly Declares US Policy Goal: To Develop a Strong, Unified, and Democratic China</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 8th] The full text of U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes's speech to the Foreign Affairs Committee is as follows:</p>
<p>During the war, the primary goal of the United States in China was to promote military unity among all political groups, thereby adding their combined strength to our common enemy, Japan. Our more distant goal was to develop a strong, unified, and democratic China. This goal was, and remains, at least equally important.</p>
<p>To achieve this more distant goal, the Chinese central government and all parties must be open and honest and use compromise to resolve all disputes. We believe, as we have always believed and insisted, that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's government provides the most satisfactory foundation for the development of democracy. However, we also believe that this government must be expanded to include representatives of all groups that are broadly organized and that do not yet have a voice in the Chinese government.</p>
<p>The solution to the problem depends mainly on the sincerity and goodwill of the Chinese leaders themselves. If our influence is a factor, then success or failure depends on how we use that influence to encourage the central government, the so-called Communist Party, and other parties to compromise with each other.</p>
<p>We officially recognize only the National Government, and our ambassador is the ambassador to the National Government. Our military supplies and economic assistance have always been given only to the National Government. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek represented China at the Cairo Conference. The Minister of Foreign Affairs of the National Government signed the United Nations Charter at the San Francisco Conference. The National Government ratified the Charter. The Minister of Foreign Affairs of the National Government attended the Foreign Ministers' Conference.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, the need for our troops to remain in China has become a cause of concern for the American public, which is understandable. Therefore, this issue has often been raised in my meetings with the press. I have made it very clear that the sole purpose of our troops in China is, according to the orders of the Supreme Allied Commander, to facilitate the surrender of large numbers of Japanese troops to the National Government forces.</p>
<p>These are just a few of the many public evidences that we recognize the government of Chiang Kai-shek as the legitimate government of China.</p>
<p>General Hurley's statement to this committee that the President and I refused to grant his request to issue such a public statement compels me to add a few words. We can tell you that in all the documents preserved in the State Department, I have never known the Ambassador to have made such a request. Furthermore, he had several conversations with the President after returning home in September, and I was also present, and I did not hear him make this request.</p>
<p>I do not know Acheson or Service personally, but because Ambassador Hurley made specific criticisms of them, I was able to read Acheson's telegram of February 28 of this year and Service's memorandum of October 10 of last year. These two documents, in Hurley's view, seemed to be strong evidence that they were obstructing the accomplishment of American goals in China.</p>
<p>Whether Acheson's telegram was appropriate must be judged in the context of the situation in China before the telegram was sent. Like his predecessor, Ambassador Gauss, Ambassador Hurley had worked to promote unity, not only between the National Government and the so-called Communist Party, but also between the National Government and other opposition parties. On February 19 of this year, when Ambassador Hurley left for the United States, he told me that negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communists were almost on the verge of breaking down.</p>
<p>After Ambassador Hurley left Chongqing, the post of Ambassador was automatically assumed by Acheson's advisor. On February 28—nine days after Hurley left Chongqing and three days before arriving in Washington—according to State Department records, Acheson sent a telegram on that day. In this telegram, he made a broad and profound analysis of the rapidly changing situation in China. The telegram concluded: "In order to adapt to the drastic changes in the environment, we must adjust America's current strategy." The telegram also explicitly stated: "The most appropriate time for discussing this issue is when General Wedemeyer and Hurley are in Washington to propose a solution."</p>
<p>Since September, we have always relied on the reports of personnel stationed at the Chinese Embassy. Acheson's telegram of February 28 was a complete and free report on the current situation in China. His suggestion was indeed an honest effort to help the State Department formulate future policy toward China, and there was absolutely nothing to indicate that he was trying to deceive his superiors. On the contrary, this telegram strongly suggested that Hurley's opinion should be sought on this matter. Service's action was a preparation for the memorandum of October 10, 1944, which Hurley mentioned in his conversation with me, and which I also carefully reviewed. When Service drafted this memorandum, he was not working at the Chongqing Embassy, although he still held diplomatic status. He was merely a political observer stationed in Yan'an by General Stilwell. At that time, he belonged to Stilwell and not to the Embassy. At that time, Hurley was serving as the President's personal representative to China in the capacity of ambassador, but he was not the American Ambassador to China, nor was he in charge of the American Embassy in Chongqing. Under these circumstances, we can say that what Service wrote did not constitute disobedience to Hurley. The memorandum itself proposed a fundamental change in the United States' policy toward the central government of China. The content was strong in tone, and the conclusion was quite radical.</p>
<p>This recommendation was written for Stilwell and also sent to the Chongqing Embassy. The Embassy sent the recommendation to the State Department without endorsing its conclusions, but added a note stating that this recommendation only represented the opinion of a political observer.</p>
<p>When this annotated memorandum arrived at the State Department, it was immediately forwarded to the China Affairs Group. Before further circulation, the China Affairs Group attached another memorandum, firmly stating that many of the conclusions were incorrect. There is no evidence here that Acheson and Service were in any way disloyal to their superiors. In fact, they were merely expressing opinions to their superiors, in a proper manner, that differed from the current government policy.</p>
<p>Another accusation by Ambassador Hurley is that some officials or employees not only expressed opinions to their superiors, but also told certain people who had contact with the Communist Party that the Ambassador did not accurately represent the American position. This behavior is, of course, unforgivable, and I will be the first to punish and dismiss officials who commit this crime. But Ambassador Hurley has not presented any evidence to me or to this committee to indicate that any employee has committed this crime. Anyone who loyally serves the government must not be dismissed because of someone's private suspicion, thereby suffering a significant loss of reputation. I do not want to hear of any State Department official who, fearing to offend another person in this department, avoids presenting honest reports and suggestions in a proper manner. If that day comes, then I will lose all the assistance and guidance that is sufficient for me to successfully perform my important duties.</p>

<h3>Finance Minister Yu's Statement: US Consulted Me on the Lifting of Capital Controls</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 8th] Regarding the US Treasury Department's announcement of the lifting of the current control regulations on financial and commercial dealings with the United Nations, Finance Minister Yu Hongjun recently issued the following statement: When the US Treasury Department decided to lift capital controls on the funds of the United Nations in the United States, it consulted the opinion of our government. We immediately formally replied to the US Treasury Department, stating that all assets of Chinese citizens already frozen in the United States and their interest should continue to be frozen and not be used without the consent of the Chinese government. However, regular transactions by Chinese citizens with foreign countries in the future should not be restricted. Furthermore, assets and interest obtained by Chinese citizens after the promulgation of the new US Treasury Department decree will also not be frozen. The US Treasury Department has fully agreed with our position, and the new decree will take effect on December 7 of this year.</p>

<h3>Weng Wenhao Reports on the Situation of Recovery and Handling in the Recovered Areas at the Standing Committee of the Political Participation Council</h3>
<p>Comparing the actual situations, the scale and success of Japanese management in Central China are far inferior to those in North China. The total capital of the North China Development Company was 500 million Japanese yen, with over 1.5 billion yen in bonds issued, and approval for the issuance of over 3 billion yen in debentures. The principal and interest of the bonds were guaranteed by the Japanese government. The company's headquarters were in Tokyo, Japan, with branches in Beiping and Zhangjiakou, and offices in Tianjin, Qingdao, Jinan, Taiyuan, and other places. The organization in Beiping was the most complete. The important projects invested in by the North China Development Company, briefly stated, include the North China Transportation Company (capital: 400 million pseudo-Federal Reserve Bank notes), the North China Telecommunications Company (capital: 100 million yen), the North China Electric Power Company (capital: 300 million yen), the Datong Coal Industry Company (capital: 120 million yen), and the North China Iron Manufacturing Company (capital: 100 million yen). It also invested in the establishment of the Shandong Mining Company, and various coal companies or associations in Jingxing, Cixian, Jiaozuo, Zhongxing, Dawenkou, Xintai, Liuquan, Shanxi, and Daqingshan, as well as the North China Coal Sales Company, the North China Alumina Company, the Light Metal Company, the Salt Industry Company, the Electrolysis Company, the Chemical Industry Association, the Nitrogen Fertilizer Company, the Fiber Control Association, the Shanxi Industry Association, the Mongolia-Tibet Electric Power Association, the Mineral Products Sales Association, and other business organizations. Among the established businesses, those worthy of attention include, for example, in the area of electric power, the Japanese newly established a 60,000 kW power plant in Beiping, a 50,000 kW power plant in Tianjin, and a 50,000 kW power plant near the Tangshan coal industry, and they have also established long-distance transmission lines, connecting these three extremely important power sources into a network. Although some of the equipment has yet to be completed, this power interconnection method increases strength, reduces costs, and is truly in line with the principles of modern power, serving as a model for our country's new-style power. The Japanese side deeply believes that North China has abundant resources and the need to develop large-scale electric power, so during the war, power experts planned the Yellow River hydroelectric power plant, setting up eight stations from Hequ to Mengjin, with a total power generation capacity of 5.17 million kW. The Hutuo River and Yongding River can also generate hydroelectric power, and it is believed that only by building dams upstream to regulate the rivers can the downstream rivers follow a normal course and avoid flooding and siltation. It can be seen that this plan is of great importance to the livelihoods of the people of the north. In terms of textiles, the Japanese have conducted many tests on various qualities and have learned that coking coal and bituminous coal, in addition to Kailuan, Jingxing, Cixian, and Boshan, are also extremely valuable in Wulai and Xintai. Datong bituminous coal, although it needs to be blended to produce coke, is of high quality and abundant in quantity, which is extremely important. The Japanese have centered the iron and steel plants in Beiping, Qingdao, and Tangshan, but the production of steel rails has not yet been implemented. In terms of the construction of Shandong alumina, the Japanese planned to use it to make aluminum oxide and built a factory in Nanding, most of which has been completed, transporting the aluminum oxide to Japan for aluminum production. From these examples, it can be seen that the Japanese policy focuses on production in our country, only to the level of raw materials or semi-finished products, while the final refining process, to become practically useful products, is left to the Japanese mainland. This colonial policy of control was originally valued by the Japanese. Regarding transportation, Tianjin is an important port in North China, but the siltation of Dagukou has increased, with a depth of only four feet this summer, which is worrying for the future of Tianjin. For improvement, the Japanese have dug another canal leading to Tanggu, deepening the channel and strengthening the port, which is an essential strategy for creating a large port in the north and is worthy of continued completion. Overall, the methods used by the Japanese in North China and Central China emphasize centralized organization and large-scale operation. Centralization increases strength and efficiency, while large-scale operation increases output and reduces costs. This is the direction that modern business operations should take and can serve as a reference for our country's future development. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Failed Attempts to Attack Guihua and Baotou; He Long Requests Reinforcements from Yan'an; Overseas Chinese Groups in the Provisional Capital Telegraph to Request Curbing Communist Rebellion</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 8th] According to reliable sources, He Long, having failed to attack Guihua and Baotou, telegraphed Yan'an requesting an increase of 300,000 troops. Mao Zedong convened a meeting to discuss the request and decided to send 150,000 reinforcements. However, due to insufficient troop allocation, a large number of elite troops will be transferred from various places in eastern Gansu and northern Shaanxi, while also attempting to open up Yulin to transport troops.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guihua, 6th] Since gathering in the northern mountains of Baotou, the Communist army has been extensively intercepting grain and coal transported by people from Shigou and the back mountains. In addition, He Long personally led two regiments of guards, moving eastward from the northern mountains of Baotou, with unclear intentions. Gunfire has been incessant in the suburbs of Guihua in recent days, especially intense at night.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 8th] Overseas Chinese groups in the provisional capital jointly commemorated the fourth anniversary of the Pacific War on the 8th and resolved to telegraph the government requesting a clear order to curb the Communist rebellion, which is undermining unity.</p>
<h3>Last Supper at Wang Shijing's Residence; Situation of Arresting Traitors in Beiping; Zhou Zuoren Denies Being a Traitor</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Urgent Telegram from Beiping, 8th] On the evening of the 5th, Wang Shijing, a traitor in Beiping, held a lavish dinner party at his residence in Beibingmasi, attended by many major traitors. After the dinner, all the traitors present were arrested. Those who did not attend were arrested by the military police overnight in separate actions. Wang Yintai was arrested at his home. After Japan surrendered, he rushed to print a collection of speeches by Mr. Meng Qun, listing all his statements that could be construed as complicit. When Wang Kemin was arrested, he collapsed and had to be helped onto a reclining chair and into a car by four people. Wang Yitang has been ill since the 6th and is staying in Room 127, a first-class ward, at the Central Hospital, where guards have been assigned. Zhou Zuoren firmly denies being a traitor. The authorities' standard for arresting traitors this time is to only consider their actions. As of now, more than 70 people have been arrested in Beiping and Tianjin. The traitors in Beiping are being held in three locations, including the former residence of Shi Huan and the Yuan Family Garden. It is reported that their living conditions are comfortable, except for the suffering of some addicts. The authorities stated that once the investigation of their rebellious and egregious acts is clear, they will be handed over to the court for trial.</p>

<h3>Sunday Forum: Atomic Energy and China's Future</h3>
<p>— Zhao Zengjue</p>
<p>1.  The Importance of the Atomic Bomb</p>
<p>The atomic bomb mobilized the most outstanding scientists from the United States, Britain, and Canada. Two atomic bombs destroyed the two large cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan, prompting Japan's collapse. The atomic bomb made the Soviet Union suspicious and uneasy, and made British and American leaders travel extensively to discuss it. The atomic bomb caused the U.S. Congress to organize a special committee to study how to deal with it, and the United Nations to organize a special committee to handle its custody. The atomic bomb changed future tactics, shook every corner of the world, and opened a new era of science. The position of oil and coal, which have controlled the world's power source for a hundred years, is likely to be replaced by atomic energy, causing a shake-up. In short, since the first atomic bomb fell on Hiroshima, the 20th century has stepped into the new atomic age. The political, military, industrial, and lifestyle of the entire world may soon undergo significant changes. The atomic bomb not only opened a new era for the world but also represents the comprehensive crystallization of the world's scientific progress!</p>
<p>2.  A Brief History of the Atomic Bomb</p>
<p>To talk about the history of the atomic bomb, one must trace back to the discovery and research of radioactive atoms. Radioactive atoms that have been discovered on Earth include Uranium, Thorium, Polonium, Radium, Radon, and many other types, all of which automatically have continuous radioactivity. In fact, other elements that were not originally radioactive can also become radioactive after being bombarded by radioactive elements. Among them, uranium and radium are the most important. The uranium used in atomic bombs today was discovered earliest, by the French scientist Becquerle in 1896. Later, because everyone's attention was focused on radium research, uranium remained anonymous for many years.</p>
<p>Various radioactive elements are not very stable. Their atomic nuclei are originally composed of a certain number of positive protons, negative electrons, and neutral neutrons. (It is generally believed that a neutron is a close combination of a proton and an electron.) However, because radioactive X-rays (rays composed of four protons and two electrons) and B-rays (electron rays) are emitted, the atomic nucleus gradually becomes lighter, forming various isotopes, such as radium with R-226, R-224, R-206, etc., and uranium with U-238, U-235, U-234, etc. According to the opinion of general scientists, radium is actually formed from the continuous transmutation of uranium, and uranium can also be transmuted into aluminum. All heavier elements can be transmuted into lighter elements.</p>
<p>When radium radiates, the surrounding temperature is four to five degrees higher than room temperature, which is a kind of radiation ability. Roughly, one gram of radium can generate 300,000 calories of heat when completely radiated. Various radioactive substances continue to lose energy, dispersing into radiation, heat, and light. Each gram of substance contains about 9 followed by 20 zeros ergs of energy. However, the radiation time is very long, such as 3,200 years for radium and 920 million years for uranium. The energy radiated in each unit of time is not much. But the reason why radium can treat cancer is because its radiation can destroy cell tissue. Therefore, it must be used very cautiously to avoid harming the human body, its power is already considerable. If the energy accumulated for a long time is completely released at once, its power would be astounding, and its destructiveness can be imagined.</p>
<p>Because scientists wanted to utilize this huge energy and also wanted to accelerate the transmutation of elements, they tried to break the atom, so that the potential energy accumulated in the atomic nucleus would immediately become kinetic energy. The reason for using uranium is that uranium-235 (U-235) is very unstable and relatively easy to break, and the production of potassium is also relatively abundant, about one million times that of radium. Various countries have been conducting research in this area for more than ten years. The original motivation was of course to use this inexhaustible source of power to replace the gradually depleting coal and oil. Unfortunately, the war broke out, and thus the atomic bomb was born, appearing before industrial applications. It is estimated that one pound of uranium-235 is equivalent to 15,000 tons of TNT explosives. The problem is to extract uranium-235 in large quantities.</p>
<p>When Britain was in turmoil in 1940, British scientists were quite confident in the research of the atomic bomb. Therefore, they consulted with the United States and moved this group of scientists to the safer United States, using American scientific equipment and the rich uranium of Great Bear Lake in Canada to continue research. As a result, they caught up with the Axis powers and invented the atomic bomb first.</p>
<p>It is said that the research and manufacture of the atomic bomb cost a total of 200 million US dollars and mobilized 65,000 workers. Among them, our country has a female scientist, Dr. Wu Jianxiong, who was researched by Nobel Prize winner Lawrence and made indirect contributions. During the first test, the organizers were deeply afraid that the radiation would cause nitrogen and gas in the air to combine in large quantities, resulting in a shortage of gas in the world. The test results were not like this, and this fear disappeared. The effect of the atomic bomb is not only to generate huge explosive power, one atomic bomb is equivalent to 20,000 tons of explosives, making the ground architecture, but also rupturing the internal structure of all living things.</p>
<p>3.  The of Atomic</p>
<p>The appearance of the atomic bomb overwhelmed all other weapons, and the entire tactics will be greatly changed. A country only needs to have a small number of air forces, carrying atomic bombs, to launch a night attack on another country. The attacked country can immediately fall into a miserable and desperate situation. All factories and flora and fauna are destroyed, transportation and production are completely stopped, tanks become fragments, cannons turn into dust, and steel-armored fleets are as useless as paper boats. The powerful army is immediately isolated and helpless, everything is over. In short, striking first is the key. One atomic bomb can put the enemy country in a state of eternal destruction.</p>
<p>Since the destructiveness of the atomic bomb is so great, there is currently no appropriate defense method in the world. If this atomic bomb falls into the hands of aggressors, the world will never have peace. Therefore, the world is in panic, either demanding to announce this secret or seeking appropriate custody. Our country's position is that if this secret can be kept by the United States forever, it may not be impossible, because she is not used to invade but to protect peace. But whether the secret can be kept permanently is a problem. Scientific progress is endless, and for countries aspiring to science, the discovery of this secret is only a matter of time. So-called management can only temporarily maintain the secret of the advanced countries' atomic bomb manufacturing methods, but it cannot prevent scientific efforts from countries' research and success!</p>
<p>The use of atomic energy in industry will soon be realized. It is said that if a small piece of uranium-235 is placed in a water-filled container, a large amount of water vapor will be continuously generated, which is more durable and cheaper than using other fuels. The only unresolved issues are how to handle uranium-235 safely, how to obtain uranium-235 as cheap as gasoline or coal, and whether other abundant and cheap atomic energy can be utilized. We know that the reason why Britain is so rich and powerful now is because she was the first to industrialize; the reason why the United States is so rich and powerful now is because she was the first to mass-produce. Therefore, any country that can first apply atomic energy to industry will also take the lead on the road to wealth and strength. This is also one of the reasons why other countries demand the disclosure of atomic secrets. [Continued on Page 2]</p>

<h3>U.S., British, and Soviet Foreign Ministers' Meeting to Be Held in Moscow on the 15th of This Month to Discuss Controlling the Secrets of Atomic Energy</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 8th] The State Department officially announced today that the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union are scheduled to hold a meeting in Moscow on the 15th of this month to exchange views on the management of atomic energy. Secretary of State Byrnes is expected to leave early next week to meet with British Foreign Secretary Bevin and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on the agreed date. The meeting will also discuss other issues, including: (1) the Iranian issue, (2) the United Nations' control of Japan, (3) the Chinese unity issue, and (4) getting the European peace plan on track.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 8th] It was confirmed last night that the foreign ministers of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union are scheduled to meet in Moscow on December 15th. The meeting is expected to discuss the situation in China and the control of Japan, but their main task is to discuss the disclosure and control of atomic secrets and to eliminate Soviet concerns about this. According to Reuters diplomatic correspondent, other issues that are expected to be discussed are: (1) the international repercussions of the situation in China, (2) Far East issues (management of Japan and peaceful settlement), (3) Iran, and (4) general discussions on European peace agreements. The underlying intention of the Moscow meeting is clearly to create the best possible atmosphere between the major powers and to enable the major powers to agree on a common policy on major issues and to participate in the General Assembly of the United Nations. London pointed out that the meeting of the three foreign ministers does not contradict or deviate from the principle of mutual consultation among the five foreign ministers. Reuters diplomatic correspondent said that the meeting should by no means be regarded as a three-nation "collusion" aimed at imposing pre-agreed resolution methods on the rest of the United Nations.</p>
<h3>The Supreme Authority of the British Army Decides to Increase Troops in Java to Help the Netherlands Restore Sovereignty in the Dutch East Indies</h3>
<p>[United Press, Batavia, 8th] The supreme authority here announced today that Britain has decided to continue transferring troops to Java to maintain law and order and restore Dutch sovereignty over the Dutch East Indies. This decision will end Britain's policy of compromise with the leaders of the East Indies independence movement. It is heard that it was decided at a meeting in Singapore this week between Mountbatten and the British, French, and Dutch commanders. Well-informed sources said that the planned plan requires the use of a large number of Dutch troops and British reinforcements.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Batavia, 8th] A hand grenade exploded near the hangar of the airport here yesterday, only 15 yards away from several British officers. The Allied authorities are very concerned about this. Indonesian troops from Semarang are advancing towards the airport there. When an air force personnel flew there yesterday morning, he saw Indonesian artillery shelling an area only one and a half miles from the airport.</p>
<h3>The Indian Political Situation is About to Have a New Development</h3>
<p>Gandhi to Meet with Wavell on Monday</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Calcutta, 7th] British and Indian political figures are currently using Calcutta as a meeting center to seek new developments in the Indian political situation. According to various reports, we can believe that something is brewing. The following matters together are of great importance: (1) Wavell has agreed to meet Gandhi in Calcutta on Monday evening; (2) the Governor of Bengal and Gandhi continued to meet four times, and then met with the leaders of the Indian Congress Party; (3) the Congress Working Committee will actively discuss matters "containing great possibilities" from today.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Calcutta, 7th] Nehru said today that the painful events of the Chinese civil war will delay the work of national construction in China. When asked by reporters whether he intends to visit China again, he replied that he would be prepared to visit if he "could help."</p>
<h3>Pauley Announces: Japanese Industrial Equipment Should Be Dismantled and Transferred as Reparations</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 7th] Pauley, the U.S. representative to the Allied Reparations Committee, said that he advocates transferring a large amount of Japanese industrial equipment to neighboring countries because they have contributed to the war and suffered sacrifices and should be compensated. The surplus industrial equipment that should be removed from Japan is: first, machines, about 350,000 to 400,000 units; second, ordnance factory equipment; third, the equipment and accessories of 20 shipyards; fourth, steel mills, only factories that produce 2.5 million tons of steel annually will be left. Pauley also advocated removing all aluminum manufacturing machines to ensure the complete destruction of the Japanese aviation industry.</p>
<h3>Japanese Crowds Demonstrate Around the Tokyo City Government</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 8th] It was announced here today that 1,000 Japanese people held a mass demonstration because they felt that the distribution of food, clothing, and housing by the Japanese authorities was "unequal," and were eventually dispersed by the U.S. military police stationed in the Matsuyama district. An Allied spokesman said that this demonstration was held around the city government (where military supplies are also stored), so its target was the mayor, not the Allied forces.</p>
<h3>Konoe, the Culprit of the Invasion of China, Has Committed Unforgivable Crimes</h3>
<p>Used the Pacific Society to Promote an International Propaganda Plan</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 7th] It was reported last night that MacArthur ordered the arrest of Konoe Fumimaro, who is to be tried as a war criminal, had used the Japanese branch of the well-known Pacific Society organization to engage in a large-scale international propaganda plan during an important period between the September 18th Incident and the Pacific War. Konoe placed figures from his trusted "think tank" in key positions to gain control of the Japanese branch of the Pacific Society. The so-called think tank included Tsurumi Yusuke and Ushiba, etc. During Konoe's three terms as prime minister, Japan made three of the most important national policy decisions that led to the outbreak of the Pacific War. At that time, Ushiba served as the prime minister's private secretary and the chief secretary of the Japanese branch of the Pacific Society. Therefore, during the historically significant period of Konoe's tenure as prime minister, there was a very close connection between the Japanese branch of the Pacific Society and the Japanese Cabinet. The funds for the Japanese branch of the Pacific Society came from donations from the business community through Saionji Kinmochi (the deceased elder statesman), who had a close relationship with Konoe. Konoe also appointed Saionji Kimikazu, the grandson of Saionji Kinmochi, as the secretary of the Japanese branch of the Pacific Society. Mitsubishi and Mitsui and other companies also made donations. Konoe was able to contact many prestigious visitors to Japan through the Pacific Society's connections. After Japan's invasion of Northeast China began, Konoe, as president of Tokyo University of Commerce, had Sadajiro Ueda write a very lengthy report explaining the theory of "Japan feeling population pressure." At the end of 1936, when the World Pacific Society met in California, the Japanese branch of the Pacific Society presented Ueda's report to the conference, which made many world economists believe that Japan's foreign expansion was a natural and reasonable trend. When the "China Incident" began and evolved into war, Konoe again sent Saionji Kimikazu as his special envoy to China, ostensibly to explore whether peace was possible, but in reality to scout out the Chinese leaders' preparations for resistance and how prepared they were. He consulted with Song Ziwen and reported to the government after returning to Japan that China was prepared for a long-term resistance war, and warned the Japanese government that it should send a large number of troops in order to end the China Incident as soon as possible. Konoe apparently immediately decided to send a large number of troops, and thus the war broke out.</p>
<h3>Trials of Japanese War Criminal Groups to Begin Next January</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 7th, United Press] The chief prosecutor announced that the group trials of suspected Japanese war criminals are scheduled to begin next January. Among the first batch of war criminals to be tried by the Allied court, Tojo is roughly included. He refused to declare whether the Japanese Emperor would be tried.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 8th] Three hundred Japanese war criminals accused of abusing prisoners of war are scheduled to be tried in Yokohama on the 17th.</p>
<h3>Japanese House of Peers Members: 29 War Criminals</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 8th] Twenty-nine members of the Japanese House of Peers have been ordered by MacArthur's headquarters to be considered war criminals and should be imprisoned. Count Sakai Tadamasa, the vice-chairman of the House, has submitted his resignation to Marquis Tokugawa Iesato, the chairman of the House.</p>

<p>Songjiang: Reporting Traitorous Merchants Who Extorted Military Rice</p>
<p>The most cruel period of the enemy's extortion of military rice, killing people, and destroying houses in Songjiang was this spring and summer. The amount of extortion was as high as one stone and eight dou per mu [unit of land area]. Huayangqiao was the peak. The accomplices of the enemy were the Rice Control Association and the general traitorous military rice merchants. Therefore, the farmers rose up to report them. Ye Jiugao, the director of the Rice Control Association, has been arrested by the county and is being strictly guarded, awaiting investigation. As for Gu Yangchu, the military rice merchant in Huayangqiao, he has already fled elsewhere, and the rice shop he set up in the area has been sealed off by personnel.</p>
<h3>Sunday Forum: Atomic Energy and China's Future</h3>
<p>— Zhao Huijue</p>
<p>(Continued from Page 1)</p>
<p>4.  Our Country Should Study Atomic Energy</p>
<p>Our country is a scientifically backward country. The Father of the Nation once loudly called on the people to catch up. But to date, how much have we caught up? Are we catching up head-on? To talk about catching up, we must make more efforts in science from now on, everyone must make efforts! To talk about catching up head-on, we must call on outstanding scientists across the country to study the secrets of atomic energy from now on! The physicist specializing in radioactivity, such as the aforementioned Ms. Wu, should also be recalled, and a special college should be established for planned research. The importance of this research can also be divided into two aspects: military and industrial.</p>
<p>Our country's military equipment manufacturing is originally backward. Even if we make a sudden effort to catch up, we will not be able to stand shoulder to shoulder with other countries in a short period of time. However, the atomic bomb occupies the most important part of military equipment. If we can research and manufacture it ourselves, the seriousness of the backwardness of military equipment can also be reduced. If we cannot manufacture atomic bombs ourselves in the future, it can be said that we have no national defense. In today's world where universal harmony has not been realized, it is really very dangerous, and the danger is increasing day by day. This does not mean that we do not need to study the rest besides the atomic bomb. For example, airplanes are also necessities for dropping atomic bombs, and other military equipment is also indispensable for maintaining law and order and for protracted warfare. But to be listed as one of the four powers, to maintain world peace, and to be decisive, we must have the ability to manufacture atomic bombs ourselves to be successful.</p>
<p>As for the industrial aspect, although our country is known as having a vast territory and abundant resources, it is actually a barren land with poor people. Coal, the source of power, is said to be spread throughout the provinces, but the wide distribution does not necessarily mean abundant reserves. According to investigations, the reserves account for only 6% of the world's total. As for oil reserves, they are even more negligible, and whether there will be new discoveries in the future is a question. It is difficult to develop large-scale industries with such a scarce source of power. But with cheap and inexhaustible atomic energy, the development of industry is very promising. Moreover, our country's production of various other industrial raw materials is not complete. If we can use atomic energy to transmute substances, the problem of lack of raw materials can also be easily solved.</p>
<p>Recently, the United States has also invented the extraction of atomic energy from hydrogen. (Or it is heavy hydrogen containing two protons.) It is also heard that they are studying the use of cosmic rays to break atomic nuclei. In short, atomic science is only just beginning now, and there is no end in sight to the path of progress. It is not too late to catch up as soon as possible. It is hoped that the country will cultivate more scientists on this most important issue, and that scientists will also study diligently and make continuous efforts, without being complacent. Make further progress and enable our country to occupy a position in world atomic science. After eight years of hard fighting, our country has sacrificed countless lives and properties and sacrificed the happiness of countless people. It was easy to raise our international status. With the current status, if scientists cannot catch up head-on in atomic energy research, the status of a strong country will not be maintained. Therefore, our country must catch up head-on and study atomic energy to seek self-improvement and maintain world peace. I would like to encourage all Chinese people to do so.</p>

<h3>Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua Reports: Enemy Revised Textbooks to Implement Enslavement Education</h3>
<p>Middle and Primary School Students to be Treated with Leniency; Emphasis on Thought Examination and Investigation</p>
<p>[Chongqing Airmail Report from Our Newspaper] Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua, at a press conference held in the ministry's conference room a few days ago, reported his impressions of inspecting education in the recovered areas, stating:</p>
<p>Inclined Toward the Motherland</p>
<p>Most of the teachers and students in the recovered areas, under the eight-year control of the enemy, although physically deprived of freedom, still ardently leaned toward the motherland. Although the enemy spared no effort to revise textbooks at all levels to implement enslavement education, the results were nil. In the occupied areas, schools were required to raise the puppet flag every morning as usual, but except for those who were monitored and forced to comply, most used the school flag instead. He deeply felt that during the eight years of the war of resistance, although the land was occupied, the spirit was not. Moreover, most intellectuals in the occupied areas continued to carry out psychological resistance.</p>
<p>Turned Back Midway</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there were also many practical difficulties. Schools in various places could not relocate inland. A small number of colleges and universities were obstructed by funding during the inland relocation, and had to turn back midway, which is truly admirable. Based on the above situation, in addition to the resolutions of the National Education Post-War Rehabilitation Conference, the rationalization of education in the recovered areas still requires detailed research. Those professors or students who willingly betrayed the country and surrendered to the enemy, if there is solid evidence, will still be severely punished. He conducted a detailed investigation during this inspection, with particular emphasis on faculty and professors and students above the college level.</p>
<p>Classes as Usual</p>
<p>As for middle and primary school students, it is necessary to "treat them with leniency," because the current middle school students were still primary school students during the war, and the current primary school students were still in their infancy and had no individual freedom at all. It is hoped that this point will also arouse the attention of all sectors. Middle and primary schools in Nanjing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Tianjin, Beijing and other places are still ordered to hold classes as usual. Colleges and universities have successively established temporary university preparatory classes, all of which are presided over by special commissioners of the Ministry of Education. On the faculty side, the special commissioner temporarily employs faculty, mostly those who originally taught in schools in the occupied areas, but this is only temporary.</p>
<p>Examination Method</p>
<p>The examination method for students in the future will place special emphasis on the examination of thought. Second, those who score above 75 in the remedial courses (including Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, Party doctrine, President Chiang Kai-shek's thought, basic courses, and required courses) will be assigned to various public and private universities. Those who score above 60 will be free to apply to various private universities, but the academic program will be reduced by one year to achieve a balance with the level of students in the inland areas.</p>
<h3>Child Rehabilitation: Reducing Casualties and Damage</h3>

<h3>Friendly Football Match: The Final Act; Donghua vs. Xuhui; Today at 3:00 PM at Xuhui</h3>
<p>The Sino-British Four-Team Friendly Football Tournament, hosted by Xuhui Middle School, with the participation of Donghua, Xuhui, Beifusi, Pan Maoda and other four teams, adopts a single round-robin system. Only the Donghua vs. Xuhui match remains at 3:00 PM this afternoon. Donghua has already defeated the two British military teams one after the other, while Xuhui has lost twice. Donghua's victory is almost certain. However, Donghua will not have the services of two star players, Jia Youliang and Sun Jinshun, today, and will be replaced by Lin Wenhu and Shen Jinda, which will inevitably weaken its strength. On the Xuhui side, although Mailson is absent from Shanghai, Meng Yiliang is resolutely helping, and the strength has increased rather than decreased. Donghua must also be careful. The performance of both sides is expected to be exciting. Tickets are 100 yuan, which is intended as a restriction.</p>

<p>Volleyball: Starting at 3:30 PM, Aurora University won two consecutive games with two scores of 15 to 1.</p>
<h3>Education Funding</h3>
<p>— Hu Xian</p>
<p>Any good education plan cannot be realized without funding. During these eight years of the war of resistance, the government knew the importance of education, but was constrained by the lack of funding, so it followed the wisdom of a clever housewife and cooked without rice. Due to inflation, the funding for various schools today is less than 1% of the original funding before the war. With the aim of producing shoddy goods in large quantities, it began to increase the number of new schools in large numbers, without ever considering the harm that this kind of shoddy education would cause. It is called giving young people educational opportunities, but in fact, it is delaying young people to an unknown degree. This is the harm of running education without raising sufficient funds.</p>
<p>However, it is still understandable during the war of resistance. After the end of the war, since it is advocated to build the country, we must raise as much education funding as possible so that education can gradually return to the right track and not repeat the mistakes of producing shoddy goods in large quantities. It must be known that today, in order to achieve industrial plans, cultivate cadres at all levels, and universalize national education, and to cultivate teachers and local self-government personnel at all levels that are necessary for the above, the increase in schools must be a hundred times that of today, and the funding must be ten million times that of today.</p>
<p>The government authorities must clearly recognize that in the process of building the country in the future, the importance of expanding education is definitely not less than that of completing industrial plans. To expand education, it is necessary to increase education funding as much as possible. There is a common saying in our country: "Don't leave even half a mu of land for teaching your children." This shows that the people of the country know the importance of education, and the government must also know that in order to achieve various national policies, it must have a similar determination to expand education and raise education funding as much as possible.</p>

<h3>Public Works Bureau Drains Ditches Actively to Prevent Floods</h3>
<p>In view of the frequent floods in this city, the Municipal Public Works Bureau regards flood prevention as one of its central tasks. It is currently hiring a large number of workers to actively handle the dredging of ditches and channels by district, with the aim of completing it within two months.

<h3>Wu Shaoshu Talks about Recruiting New Party Members</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency] Wu Shaoshu, Chairman of the Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters, flew to Chongqing some time ago to report on his work, which lasted more than a month. He returned to Shanghai on the 7th after completing his official duties. Yesterday, the reporter visited Wu at the Shanghai City Party Headquarters and first inquired about the working policy of the Shanghai party affairs. He said that in the past party affairs in this city were unable to openly recruit party members under the violent oppression of the enemy and puppets, so the number of party members was relatively small compared to the city's population. In the future, the recruitment of party members will emphasize both quality and quantity. All outstanding individuals will be sought to be recruited into the party. Recently, in addition to registering old party members, it is also planned to recruit a large number of new party members so that the party's organization can penetrate into all levels of the city. At present, the focus of the party's work is to prepare for the implementation of constitutional government and to complete local self-government, and strengthening the grassroots organization is a prerequisite. Shanghai is the largest city in the country with a dense population. The Municipal Party Headquarters will definitely assist the government and engage in this work actively so as to lay the foundation for democratic politics as soon as possible. Then, he asked about the reasons for suddenly developing the intention to resign from the positions of Deputy Mayor and concurrently Director of the Social Affairs Bureau and requesting a resignation from the central government. He replied: "In the past, in Shanghai, in addition to serving as the Chief Posture of the Party Headquarters and the Director of the Corps, I also served as the Jiangsu Inspector, so I felt that I was heavily burdened and often crossed the line. However, it was a time of hardship, so I had to brave the difficulties and take risks without hesitation. Last winter, I received a secret order from the central government to concurrently serve as the Political Commissioner and Military Commissioner of this city, so I came to Shanghai at the beginning of the end of the war to discuss rehabilitation work. Taking care of all parties, the responsibilities were heavy, and I felt exhausted physically and mentally. I originally intended to get rid of all my concurrent positions and take a short break when the underground work was over. Unexpectedly, the central government entrusted me with the two positions of Deputy Mayor and Director of the Social Affairs Bureau. At that time, I thought that it was the beginning of the rehabilitation period, and the military and political leaders had not yet come to Shanghai, so it was difficult to resign. I have been working hard for the past three months and felt very tired. Now that all the work is on the right track, I took advantage of this trip to Chongqing to report on my work and repeatedly asked the central government to allow me to retire, and finally it agreed to let me resign from my administrative duties and continue to be responsible for the Corps work."</p>
<h3>Lu Jingshi Talks About: Relief for Unemployed Workers; A Comprehensive Plan Has Been Drafted</h3>
<p>[Exclusive Report from Our Newspaper] Lu Jingshi, Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Social Affairs for Nanjing and Shanghai, returned to Shanghai from Chongqing a few days ago. According to a reporter's interview, a comprehensive plan for the relief of unemployed workers has been drafted and will be gradually implemented in the short term. This plan includes (1) distributing a large amount of flour, (2) implementing a large-scale work-for-relief program. Lu also said that according to statistics from the Ministry of Social Affairs and the Shanghai Unemployed Workers Relief Committee, there are more than 100,000 unemployed workers in this city. Lu continued: "I have already agreed with the National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration that the association will allocate 9,000 tons of flour, which will be distributed to the workers by the Unemployed Workers Relief Committee. It is now set at 100,000 workers in principle, and each unemployed worker can receive an average of 66 pounds of flour per month. All the flour will be distributed in three months." Lu continued, "Relief for unemployed workers should be promoted simultaneously in both symptomatic and radical ways, so I have consulted with the competent authorities and business leaders in this city on the method of resuming work in various factories so that workers can have suitable jobs as soon as possible. The Ministry of Social Affairs has discussed suitable work-for-relief plans with the Municipal Government, the National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and relevant groups in this city. I hope to be able to mobilize unemployed workers in this city in the short term to assist in various construction works in this city." Lu also said, "Regarding the issue of labor disputes, the Ministry of Social Affairs hopes that workers and industrialists can all appreciate President Chiang Kai-shek's principle of economic nation-building and work together in labor and management to increase production and strive for construction so that this city's industry can restore pre-war productivity in a stable state."</p>

<h3>China's New Invention: Shallow-Draft Gas Steamship; Yamei Ship to Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>In order to adapt to the needs of inland river navigation in our country, Huaxi Xingye Company invented a type of water-gas steamship. It has been actively researching since 1943 and finally succeeded. It has been tested on-site by the Wartime Transportation Bureau, the Navigation Department of the Ministry of Communications, the Production Bureau, the US Army Headquarters, the US Foreign Economic Administration, the Taikoo Shipping Company, etc. There are no difficulties in going up and down the rapids within a hundred miles around Chongqing. It is unanimously believed that it meets the needs of inland river navigation in our country. The advantages of this type of gas steamship are that it uses domestically produced white coal as fuel, which is extremely economical, only one-fourth of the cost of using charcoal, one-sixth of the cost of using steam engines, one-tenth of the cost of using diesel engines, and one-twelfth of the cost of using gasoline or alcohol, but the efficiency is high, the speed is high, the draft is shallow, and the operation is simple. Its benefits to China's social economy are by no means insignificant. It is reported that the gas steamship "Yamei" is undergoing a trial voyage between Chongqing and Shanghai. It has now sailed to Yichang and will arrive in Shanghai soon.</p>
<h3>Commander of the US Pacific Fleet Spruance to Arrive in Shanghai Today</h3>

<h3>Du Gang Children's Education Fund: Solicitations Initiated from All Circles</h3>
<p>The late Martyr Du Gang, former committee member of the Municipal Party Headquarters, also known as Shao Wen, dedicated himself to Party and government work and education, demonstrating diligence. In the autumn of the 32nd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1943], he was ordered to come to Shanghai to engage in underground work. Before two months had passed, the matter was exposed, and he was arrested and ultimately killed. His body was pierced with thirty-two wounds. The tragic nature of his death and the grandeur of his sacrifice are sufficient to leave a legacy of righteousness for the nation. Over a hundred key figures from the central authorities and leaders from all circles in the city, including Zhu Jiahua, Chen Lifu, Zhang Daofan, Pan Gongzhan, Qian Dajun, Wu Shaoshu, and Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, and others, initiated the solicitation of a Du Gang Children's Education Fund due to the destitute circumstances of Martyr Du's family after his death, as his six surviving children are all minors.

<h3>UNRRA Relief Supplies: Flour to be Sold at Discounted Prices Next Week</h3>
<p>The flour transported to China by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) will soon be sold publicly at discounted prices. The proceeds from this sale will be used to fund relief efforts in the recovered areas of our country. All bakeries in the city, as well as Chinese and foreign cooperatives, may apply to the Shanghai Branch of the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration for permission to purchase the flour. However, this application must be approved by the Finance Department of the Administration. The minimum quantity of flour that can be purchased from the Administration is ten bags (48 pounds per bag), and the maximum is twenty bags. Retailers who sell this discounted flour will be able to obtain some legitimate profit. The wholesale and retail prices will be determined by the Administration in consultation with the Shanghai Office of UNRRA and the Ministry of Food. The sale is expected to take place within the next week. A portion of this discounted flour is made from wheat transported to Shanghai by UNRRA. The Fuxin and Fufeng flour mills in the city are actively carrying out this work, so flour retailers can apply to the authorities of these two mills to purchase the flour.</p>

<h3>Wang Jie, a Lackey of the Enemy: Court Files Public Prosecution</h3>
<p>(This Newspaper) Wang Jie, a former secret service agent of the puppet police bureau, was accused two weeks ago of having assisted the enemy in harming patriotic individuals and was detained by the municipal police bureau. Yesterday, he was transferred by the bureau to the High Procuratorate. It is reported that on August 12th, when several members of the Sanqing Corps in the city went to Shanghai's Huangpu Radio Station to broadcast the news of the Japanese surrender on August 10th, they were arrested by the puppet authorities. At that time, Wang Jie also took advantage of his position to do evil and assist the enemy, causing the Sanqing Corps members to be subjected to whipping and torture by the enemy. It is heard that the High Procuratorate will file a public prosecution against him for being a puppet secret agent.</p>
<h3>Traitor Zhou Yiwei: Accused of Luring Workers to the Philippines</h3>
<p>Zhou Yiwei, a native of Guangdong, worked as a translator and instructor at the Shanghai branch of a Japanese-owned oil company, where he lured 83 poor people, falsely claiming that they were going to Taiwan to work, only for them to never return. The workers' families turned Zhou Yiwei over to the police, and the Procuratorate prosecuted him on charges of treason. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, he was tried in the High Court. Judge Liu Yugui first asked the defendant what kind of position he held, to which he replied that he was a translator and had nothing to do with the recruitment of workers, nor did he ever force workers to go to the Philippines. He claimed that he only knew they were going to Taiwan to work and did not know they were going to mine in Manila. The judge then summoned Qiao Changfa and four other family members of the workers for questioning, all of whom unanimously stated that Zhou Yiwei was the foreman. Seven of the workers have now returned to the country and claim that the suffering they endured in the Philippines was unbearable. The judge ordered that the hearing be adjourned until next Monday and that the returned workers be brought to court to testify. The defendant was remanded to the detention center.</p>

<h3>The First Indian Film is Released</h3>
<p>— Xiao Xun</p>
<p>(Chengdu Aviation News): The first Indian film, "Dassi," has recently arrived in Chengdu by air and will be screened at the "National Grand Theater" starting in mid-month.</p>
<p>"Dassi" (titled "Remotely Sent Yearning Geese Return" when released in Chengdu) is a completely Indian film, with all technical work being carried out entirely by Indians. This film is the debut work of "Taifu Film Company," the first Indian film company recently established. It is adapted from the original novel by modern Indian writer Pan Qiaoli and directed by the Indian person Xilun Pusi. The three leading Indian stars are the golden-voiced female singer Lan Qini, the young actor Najiemu, and the male actor Qiyani. The film is interspersed with a lot of music and songs, which are also purely Indian in flavor. However, the dialogue is in English, but copies with Indian dialogue have been produced in India.</p>
<p>Another feature is the strangeness and mystery of the story, which is full of Eastern philosophical atmosphere, coupled with the fantastic concept of the elusive "destiny." This may be a bit "incomprehensible" to us who are used to the simple and clear American film stories. It depicts a young couple who become husband and wife from lovers and suffer the manipulation of fate for more than ten years. It begins with a sudden encounter and leads to twists and turns, and then from twists and turns to combination, from combination to new misfortune, until the husband and wife separate and have been apart for ten years. Finally, they reunite again due to another sudden opportunity. The whole film is permeated with an inexplicable sense of mystery from beginning to end.</p>
<p>Hefu Film Company was only established in June this year.</p>
<h3>The "Fu Chou" in Storytelling</h3>
<p>— Jian Fan</p>
<p>The clown in drama is most likely to make people laugh with his witty remarks and interesting movements. Storytelling evolved from Kunqu Opera. In addition to singing, it depicts the expressions and movements of the characters in the book, as well as their dialogues, just like performing in a play. The difference is that one person plays several roles without makeup or decorations, and the storyteller participates in the narration to explain the story. As for depicting characters appearing on stage, the term is called "Qi Jiao Se"; more attention is paid to "Fu Chou" who create laughter. The so-called "Fu Jiao," also known as "Er Mian," is the equivalent to the "Fang Jin Chou" in Peking Opera. They are mostly treacherous villains with ulterior motives, sycophants who follow trends and flatter, and world-weary characters with other intentions. "Xiao Chou" is also known as "Xiao Hua Mian," mostly depicting lower-class society's coolies and runners, and thieves. Although they are ancient stories, comparing them to the various aspects of modern society still feels very familiar, making it a strong form of satire. Storytellers call inserting jokes "Fang Xue Tou." A storyteller must be proficient in speaking, joking, playing instruments, and singing to be considered perfect. The emphasis on "joking" shows its importance. Almost all jokes are created by the two roles of "Fu Chou," so the popular storytellers on the stage are all good at "Fu Chou." To have elegant speech and humorous tone, one must deeply study Kunqu Opera and be good at making changes. In addition, the storyteller's narration must also have a strong clown-like character to be funny and intriguing. In a major era of change, there are many wonderful and strange things among all kinds of people that storytellers can use in "comparing the past to the present" to deeply render the joke. Although old dramas and storytelling are too far removed from the era, they have a social impact. The greatest power is the satire of the world. Unfortunately, storytellers who can truly satirize the world are indeed rare.</p>

<h3>Hollywood News</h3>
<p>— Ting Fen</p>
<p>Judy Garland Becomes a Mother</p>

<p>Frank Craven Passed Away</p>
<p>Well-known Hollywood director and playwright Frank Craven recently passed away due to a heart attack at the age of 69. In addition to directing and writing scripts, Craven also acted.

<h3>Raising the Standard of Entertainment</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yizhi</p>
<p>At the welcoming party for Mr. Zhang Daofan, I said, "The reason why we in the entertainment industry do not receive the attention of society is because our art is immature, our knowledge is shallow, and our standards cannot be balanced with those of the general cultural and artistic circles! This is something we cannot deny!" Therefore, on behalf of the entertainment industry, I loudly appeal to all circles to come and guide and support us at any time!</p>
<p>However, it is unreliable to rely on others to help with everything. We still have to rely on ourselves. The entertainment industry should first unite from within, uphold the principle of "learning without end," and mutually study the progress of art. With the evolution of the times, life needs self-discipline, and we must eliminate all bad habits. We must know that entertainment, although a kind of entertainment, is not only for people to pass the time! I remember that before the Anti-Japanese War, Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, once encouraged us and said, "Drama is a kind of popular education, and performers are social mentors who go deep into the people." We are really ashamed that we often do not live up to this name, and we cannot bear this heavy responsibility! But we have to strive to bear this heavy mission! Therefore, comrades, although we dare not respect ourselves; at the very least, we must not abandon ourselves! We must fight for the entertainment industry, strive to move upwards, cultivate our own personality, and raise the standard of entertainment!</p>
<p>Short Story</p>
<h3>The Enemy (15)</h3>
<p>— Pearl S. Buck, Translated by Zhu Qi</p>
<p>Then he left the general and went back, thinking about the plan all the way. This way, everything could be unrelated to him. He didn't want to tell Hana at all, afraid that she would be afraid of the assassination at home, and in an autocratic country like Japan, this assassin was necessary. Besides this means, what else can the ruler use to deal with those who oppose him? They are necessary.</p>
<p>When he walked into the room where the American was sleeping, he did not allow his mind to exist other than reason. But when he opened the door, he was surprised to see that the young man had gotten up and was preparing to go into the garden.</p>
<p>He exclaimed, "What! Who allowed you to leave this room?"</p>
<p>Tom happily said, "I am not used to waiting for permission. My God, I feel very healthy again! But I don't know if the muscles on this side will always feel stiff?"</p>
<p>Sadao asked in surprise, "Really?" He forgot everything. "I think I seem to have prevented this phenomenon," he murmured. He pulled up the man's clothes and looked at the healing scar. He said, "If exercise can't cure it, maybe massage can be used."</p>
<p>The young man said, "This doesn't hinder me much." His young face with a thick, tough yellow beard was haggard. "Oh, doctor, I have a few words to say to you. If I hadn't met a Japanese like you—then I wouldn't be alive today, I know that."</p>
<p>Sadao bowed and said nothing.</p>
<p>"Really, I know," Tom continued warmly. The knuckles of his big, skinny hand holding a chair turned white. "I guess if all Japanese were like you, this war wouldn't have happened."</p>
<p>Sadao said with difficulty, "Maybe so. I think you can go to sleep now."</p>
<p>After he helped the child to sleep, he bowed and said, "Good night."</p>
<p>Sadao did not sleep well that night. He woke up repeatedly, thinking he heard footsteps, the sound of a branch breaking, or the movement of a stone in the garden—sounds that could be made by someone carrying something.</p>

<h3>Gold Market Hedging More Common, Bonds Generally Stable</h3>
<p>Rice Prices Continue to Rise</p>
<p>Yesterday's market saw a slight rebound in gold prices due to the situation in the wartime capital, Chongqing, appearing quite stable. Midway through trading, due to the weakening of U.S. dollars, prices once retreated to a low of 666,000. Near noon, a surge in short covering pushed prices back up, finally fluctuating around 685,000. This resulted in a slight increase of 3,000 compared to the previous close. The overall trend was very stable. General sentiment was influenced by the gold and U.S. dollar prices in Chongqing, leading to more hedging (Chongqing gold at 845,000, U.S. dollars at 1,235 yuan, roughly 685 yuan, compared to today's hedging price in this city of 620 yuan per ten taels). Therefore, the local gold market's vitality was further enhanced. However, the upward trend was not extremely intense. Ornament gold was listed at 75,000, silver bullion at 650, and silver dollars still hovered around 450. The unofficial discount rate was even looser. Many bulls in the securities industry closed out their positions, leading to an overabundance of credit. Interest rates were around 10 to 12%, with some even below 10%.</p>
<p>Affected by the market in Chongqing, U.S. dollars saw a constant stream of short selling, resulting in extreme weakness. The lowest price reached 1,083 yuan. Finally, due to the rise in gold prices, there was a slight stabilization, struggling around 1,090 yuan. The result was a further drop of more than 30 yuan compared to the previous close. The difference between it and the price of gold was thus increasingly widened. Hong Kong dollars, old notes, were stable, while new notes fell by two yuan.</p>
<p>Public bonds initially showed strength. Bulls took profits and exited the market, leading to an immediate decline. Type C bonds retreated from 610 yuan to 530 yuan. Retail investors supported them at lower prices, and they finally stabilized somewhat. The result was a drop of 10 to 35 yuan, with a fluctuating trend. Chinese stocks did not fluctuate much, generally following the gold market's movements. Foreign stocks also showed little special change.</p>
<p>Grains: Rice prices in the interior are reported to be high, and local prices have risen accordingly, increasing by about 500-600 yuan to 700-800 yuan. The oil market was tight in the morning but weak in the afternoon, with high prices followed by stagnation. Flour was also high and popular initially, then weakened due to the large amount of mid- and lower-grade flour and the scarcity of high-grade flour. Soybean production and sales were mismatched, but retail sales became active, and prices rose by 200-300 yuan. Corn was sluggish in both arrival and sales, with no significant activity in the market. Sesame was scarce in both supply and demand, with no significant fluctuations. Cowpeas were stable. Soybean cakes were balanced in supply and demand, and there were no significant changes for the time being. Liquor arrivals gradually increased, and the price was slightly less than 500 yuan, with normal digestion. Various goods are temporarily showing a fluctuating trend.</p>
<p>Asphalt: For the past two days, there were no increases or decreases. Yesterday morning, a telegram from Lanxi stated that oil prices there had fallen to 13,000 yuan, with continued weakness expected. In Jiaxing, due to abundant cypress tree sales, credit was tight, and oil prices weakened accordingly. Local merchants brought dozens of carloads of oil from Jiaxing, with prices at 16,000 yuan per picul for immediate delivery, that is, a foreign price. Deliveries were made before the Winter Solstice, with Jiaxing oil being sold at 20,000 to 19,000 yuan, and Lanxi oil at 15,000 to 16,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Gold Prices Ease</h3>
<p>U.S. Dollars Also Weaken</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper in Chongqing, 7th] (Delayed Arrival) On the morning of the 7th, factory-made gold bars were at 846,000 yuan, and cast bars were at 840,000 yuan. In the afternoon, factory-made bars opened at 845,000 yuan and closed at 842,000 yuan. Cast bars opened at 842,000 yuan and closed at 838,000 yuan. U.S. dollars opened in the morning at 1,260 yuan, with the tail end at 1,340 yuan. In the afternoon, the tail end was at 1,320 yuan, and the closing price was 1,285 yuan.</p>
