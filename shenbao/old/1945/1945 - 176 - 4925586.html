<h3>舉全力適應緊迫戰局　日整備必要態勢　國民義勇兵役法公佈實施</h3>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　日政府爲適應戰局之急迫，傾舉全國德力，加緊整備軍事及必要之設施，而期保術國土之完整，曾於五月五日施行軍事特別措置法於情勢緊迫之帝國領土一分，茲又鑑於本地決戰緊迫戰局之推移，乃自本月十九日起，開始將該法實施於帝國領土全域，業於二十三日山情報局發表。按該法擴大適用地域至全部，實爲戰時緊急指置法之必要實施，以應本土決戰及國內必要能勢之整備，意義殊爲重大。</p>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電日第八十七屆議會成立之　勇兵役法案，巳　天皇陛下核准，於二十二公布，即日付諸實施，於是應付木土決戰之國民義勇軍遂告成立。全國民義勇兵，應國家之要求，於護　皇國之神型使命下，從事鐵道，通信及生產，或與日軍一體，參與戰鬭。當本法公布時，阿南陸相拜奉上論，於二十三日夜由無綫電廣播，俾全國民週知。</p>
<h3>日駐華派遣軍　完成防禦陣　美極力迴避大陸央戰</h3>
<p>南京二十四日中央社電　冲島戰局，雖屢經日守軍之勇猛奮戰，然困難狀况仍與日供增，未有稍減，敵美貪心不足之侵攻企圖，已益形露骨，慶良問停泊地運輸船之繁結，機動部隊出現於宮古島近海等，在在顯示準備次期作戰之預兆。担任防衛中國大陸之日駐華派遣軍，對敵美接岸作戰，已完成鐵桶之布陣，如美軍果敢侵犯中國大陸，則日軍已準備予敵痛烈打擊。今春以來，大陸之日軍，對美軍之　岸作戰，即　求萬全措置，對頗頻呼號對日經反攻之渝　，予以先制攻擊。首先，華北派遣軍對蠢動於河南，湖北省之第一，第五戰區軍，予以致命打擊，　減老河口·內鄉·南陽等美軍前進基地。華南日軍亦於廣東，廣西省境內，開始行動，擊潰盤踞隆南，定南，　南地區之第七戰區軍，毫無遣　發揮夜戰軍之戰力，使之潰亂，並注視沖繩鳥戰況之歸趨。昆明之渝軍總司令部，對固若金湯之日軍佈陣，以指揮下之美式化　部隊，準備反攻態勢，並因利用地方雜軍，何應欽更不惜起用龍　爲副總司令，冀遂其苦肉之策。於此，敵美更直接將次期作戰目標指向日本本土，同時並活潑發表虛僞宣傳，極力迴避大陸決戰，期以遮斷日本本土作戰，使中國大陸日軍自形消滅。即最近渝方報紙論調，亦）致謂次期作戰目標將不花中國大陸，或爲法屬　南，其次即濟州島，以此使中國大陸之日軍殲滅，遮斷日本本土及南洋之連絡，而使之獨立化，即可達成其目的。又當麥克沃塞大演大陸接岸作戰時，亦對意料中　待中之珠江，杭州灣，山東半島之登陸問題，毫未言及。然　　　某軍評論：包含沖繩之琉球　島，為進攻日本土根據地稍嫌狹隘，　袒　復由距離太遠之憾，於此點觀之，唯有巾國大陸爲一絕好之跳躍基地。軍事觀察家對此，且一致承認如此中國大陸基地化一事，封敵陣營實爲不可抹殺，且敵美對硫黃島，冲繩島損耗之重大，深知直接實現日本本土作戰，必將遭受更大威脅，故企圖利用重慶人力·物力·以達野望之點，實屬不容懷疑。今後美軍之蠢動，或將於任何地區實行，但無論與此相策應之渝軍企圖作任何攻勢，大陸要塞因日軍將兵之充洋　志，實不得有任何微動，日本之中國派遣軍正靜待敵美之大陸接岸。</p>
<h3>美軍在渝設置　戰術司令部　戰術司令部</h3>
<p>廣州二十四日中央社電　據重慶來電稱：駐渝美軍將在重慶設立美軍戰術司令部，而廢止前在昆明之美電司令部（司令官馬克爾州阿）。又該新設司令部司令官山誰阿多就任。。大陸基地二十四日中央社電渝方刻正竭力宣傳最近即將展開對日總反攻，然其總反攻華確之美式渝軍及其戰略能態勢，仍顯著弱小。例如美式渝軍之編成裝備，火砲依然以迫擊砲爲主力，僅有一部酊置野山砲，與正式美軍師團之火砲裝備，以十生的及十五生的榴彈炮為主力，聯隊亦配由六生的及八生的野山炮等相較，名雖屬美式，實則更遜於第三流之美軍師團，由其量戰法，以之圓滑補給　絕對要件，然渝軍賴渝印空路與緬緬公路，亦終因補給路綫設備不全，　料彈藥儲藏困難，不能從事作長期戰鬪，因此培養三十師之戰力，需要相當準備時期。又渝方去編成靑年學生軍十師以下之美式師團，亦無任何成就，結果美式渝軍之根幹，乃爲由緬甸方面調面之祈　第一第二師與新　第六軍，然其戰力配置亦不統一。由此可窺知策應美國大陸登岸作戰之重慶對日德反攻，其宣傳與實際相距猶谷厘巴板前日空襲</p>
<h3>魯等附近激戰　厘巴板前日空襲</h3>
<p>南方前綫基地二十四日中央社電敵於婆罹灣方而登陸後，復使十餘艘大型艦艇游弋於婆羅洲南方之米里近海，實行砲　及掃海偵察後，二十日以運輸船四艘，大型舟艇十艘及登陸用艇三十艘，於米里北方二十公里魯登附近開始登陸，當地日軍守備部隊刻正與其激戰中。而婆羅灣東岸烏愛斯頓地區之日軍部隊，十八日以來向敵登陸軍陣地果敢肉搏，使敞蒙受甚大之損害。</p>
<p>西南太平洋基地二十四日中央社電　敵小型機P38型　P47型等，綜計二十架，於廿三日來製　厘把板，當地日軍部隊擊落其二架，並與接近該島之敵艦艇交戰將其擊退。</p>
<p>博多灣落機雷</p>
<p>岡二十四日中央社電敵機B29型機十餘架，於二十四日上午零時左右迄二時四十分問，由鹿兒島縣南方海面侵入，於　多　投下　雷後，經大分縣南部逸去。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>堅定國策與民意機關</h3>
<p>國府陳代主席鑒於時局緊張，有如千鈞一髮，故特親自巡視皖淮豫省地方軍政設施，指示一切，以期配合時局需要，並宜示中央政策以求上下一體。我們對這次巡視，更覺有三種意義。</p>
<p>第一，我們能因此更深刻更淸晰了解現時局下中央的施政方針。</p>
<p>第二，我們能因此認識中央對全國時局和對各地民衆負責的精神。</p>
<p>第三，我們能因此認請中央與地方軍政設施的協調一致，足以應付任何環境而貫澈中央的國策。</p>
<p>經過陳代主席這次對皖淮豫三省的巡視，中央對地方當局及各部門工作人員的懇切的關懷，自將激發地方官民擁護中央國策施行而發生更有利的向心作用，足以促進和平區的政治革新，也是全國新一的主要前提條件。</p>
<p>陳代主席檢閱皖淮豫軍隊時所致訓詞，　切闡明：「中央的政策，無論時局如何緊迫，決不變更。」「中央的政策是什麼？簡單的說，是和平反共建國。」這是極簡單明朗的聲明！</p>
<p>在現階段下中央實施「和平反共建國」的國策，陳代主席也明切的指出了三點，就是：第一，「爲着中國的自由獨立，東亞的解放，惟有貫澈參戰的初衷，加緊協力，完遂戰爭」：第二，「是反共政策，國府　都當時，固是如此，現在更是如此，將來亦是如此；」第三，「要從內部的統一做起，更擴而充之，達到全國的統一。祗有統一才有力量，惟有力量才能担負更大的任務。」這三大實施國策的方針，對近來各方面所傳的種種謠言，完全肅淸了，同時指示出官民共同奮鬥的大道，我們惟有團結力量，向共同大逍邁進。</p>
<p>我們擁護中央的國策和實施方針，但是，我們認爲要從速實現這種大政方針，有一個基木的前提條件，就是爲先獲得廣大民衆的眞正擁　，使人民充分了解政府施策，使人民對於政府施策有陳述及提供意見之機會，因此建立民意機關一點，實有從速實現的必要。以上海爲例，自從市政諮詢委員會成立以來，雖未能謂爲眞正民意機關，雖尚有許多地方未能充分發揮民意機關的使命，但是，實際上對於市府施策的協力推行，對於民間疾苦解除的建議，不無相當成就。</p>
<p>而上海市政諮詢委員會之成立，係陳代主席在上海市長任內促成，更可見陳代主席對於民意機關之重視。現在陳代主席主持中樞政務，所以我們今日更希望，中央方面的民意機關，能早日成立；同時，地方的各級民意機關，亦能同時成立。聞浙江省府已在積極籌設民間諮詢機關，希望各省亦能繼起成立。</p>
<h3>凉台閒話</h3>
<p>— 吉田東祐</p>
<p>蘇聯與中國革命</p>
<p>問：　但蘇聯不參加太平洋戰爭而太平洋戰爭宣告結東時，中共在此次戰爭中所建立起來的地位，豈不是亦將隨之面消滅麽？抗日戰爭一結束，重慶則立刻準備發動內戰，以期統一全國，對抗這種危險性，中共在七全大會上也曾　作主要議題來討論。毛澤東曾在大公上聲明過：「重慶國民黨政府靠美國力量擊退日本後，一定會像希臘流亡政府假借有國力量撲滅希臘　擊隊的那樣　醜劇，在東方再重演一番，屠殺我國同胞」。假如蘇聯爲拯救中共的這種厄運，思出兵中國，則蘇聯參加太平洋戰爭本身，豈不是最可能減少國共摩擦的一種方法麽？</p>
<p>答：固然，　聯希望主義相同的中共成為中國的主人翁。但是，蘇聯也很曉得目前中國的公認政府，是東慶而非延安。無論中共怎樣說重慶政府是人所共棄的壞政府，但只要重慶有國民承認其爲政府，則蘇聯援助延安仇視重慶，就會被視為干涉中國的內政。所以無論蘇聯怎樣關懷中國的革命，但史太林却無意武力干涉他國的內政。中國革命，無論從那一個視角來看，都一致公認爲是解放亞洲的最最主導性因素。中國革命，跟印度的獨立解放有密切不可分離的關係。只要中國革命成功，則印度自然就會擺脫英國的極梏。火英帝國如失去印度，實際上則等於貴族失去世襲的采邑，而成爲一個光身漢。所以蘇聯前此尚受托洛斯基「不斷革命論」的支配時，曾把中國革命視爲蘇聯他界革命政策的最重要問題。自從史太林否定了托洛斯基的「不斷革命論」，而高高舉起「一國建設社會主義」的大　後，中國革命便脫離了蘇聯的關懷主要對象，但不待言，中國革命仍不失蘇聯的最重大問題之一。無論史太林如何關心小國革命，但他認爲肩負中國革命責任者仍爲中國人本身。如果像中國共產黨所說，重慶政府是地主軍閥資本家的聯合政府，必須加以推翻，則執行此任務者，是中國人民大衆本身。譬如有人聲明「不承認蔣介石」，但蔣介石只要事實上受到中國人民的擁護，則蔣介石政權仍不失爲中國政府。因此，蘇聯所採取的立塲，就是中國的革命，希望中國人民按照自已的需要，自己來幹。共產主義，這國然可以說是由前此戰敗的俄國變成今日勝利的蘇聯之主義力，然而決不可能把這種共產主義動原封不動，讓中國囫圇吞棗式地接受。雖然在中國有同一名稱的共產主義在法陣，但這必須單招中國得客觀經濟條件，由中國人自己來發揚光大。在歷史上可以看到，縱然進步的卓越的政治思想，在經濟條件尚未充分成熱的一個國家裏，被外國強制地輸入進來時，但該國人民卻不接受，反而拚命排斥。拿破崙之佔領西班牙，即其一例。拿破崙消滅了西班牙的舊政體後，想在西班牙實施法國革命的新制度。然而西班牙的國民却把這位自稱「解放者」的拿破崙，認爲是異族侵略者，於是揭竿而起的武裝暴動，普遍發生，最後的結果，當時堪稱世界第一的法國近代化軍隊，竟被西班牙人的游擊戰術驅逐於國外。其後，這種戰爭方法，愈爲世人所注意。而今日稱遊擊戰為「蓋力拉戰」，實際上這是來同法文的「Cuerilus」字，該字的意思，最初是指當時西班牙作戰而言。這話說得離體太遠了，話再說回來，史太林恐怕不會效法拿破崙，在中國再演一次西班牙歷史劇吧！</p>
<p>日渝可能妥協麽？</p>
<p>問：但你也承認，蘇聯旣然希望中共支配中國，自然對於重慶和日本締結全面和平這件事情，決持反對態度，所以重慶想與日木妥時，蘇聯一定會用某種手段加以阻撓，加以破壞。根據這一點來看，重慶與日本問的全而和平空　　厚起來時，或許蘇聯將以參戰方法來阻　實現吧！</p>
<p>答：蘇聯在目前，記爲重慶政權與日木問的全面和平，是不可能的。因爲第一，按照目前的情况說，決不可能府渝日單獨媾和，而美日仍在交戰的情形；第二，蘇聯知道現在美國的戰指導者和日木的指導者問，絕無妥協的餘地，第一個問題，我們再詳細地探討一下。</p>
<p>一般人都認爲這在兩三年前，重慶政府的外交政策，早已唯華盛頓的馬首是瞻了。我並不因這句話而抹殺現在中國方興未艾的民族主義力量。縱令重慶的兩三個領袖被美國所收買。而重慶的政策被他們所把持，但這種國策如危害中國的獨立自主，則中國人民決不會　爾而息，同時重慶政府也無力撲滅所有國內不滿現狀的份子。重慶政權的外交，縱令在形式上像是追隨華盛頓的決定，然而這只有對於中國的獨立自主有利時，方可推行無阻，如脫離這一路綫，則必引起知識份子的激烈抨擊，使其復歸本來的路綫，這就是重慶現狀的描寫。在這一點上，重慶外交仍然可以說是山重慶自己來決定的。中國的外交政策『只要不是由華盛頓來決定，而是由重慶來決定，那末一定有人認爲渝日單獨媾和，或許可能。我的看法正相反，唯其重慶外交不決定於華盛頓，反而得出一個否定的結論來，即在目前的情况下，全而和平愈不可能。固然，重慶也有人想像得到，日本滅亡後，美國將取下對中國旣往的假仁假義面具，而露出本來的猙獰面目來。這種人還認爲單靠重慶的力量日後對付美國，實不啻螳臂當車，於是便想未雨綢繆，先與日本（在這種塲合上，他們認爲日本是反侵略者）覓取妥協。然而在目前的情况上，日本只想與美國拼個死活，那末重慶就無考慮妥協的餘地。假令重慶當局中現在在某種程度上仍有這類妥協派，但也決不可能使中國的民族政策走上這一方向。</p>
<p>日美可能妥協麽？</p>
<p>現在再談一下第二個問題。然則美國和日本是否有成立妥協的可能呢，有一部份人，把這種希望寄托在蘇聯跟英美解決歐洲問題之矛盾上，和　　山會議的矛盾發展上，自然誰都不能否認蘇聯與英美問的政策，是有矛盾的。一部份英美統治階級，在內心　非常恐懼蘇聯的飛黃勝達，這是事實，這批人感覺到蘇聯富強起來後，就會影響他們自身地盤的逐漸土崩瓦解。然而他們認爲，只要史太林堅持目前的這樣外交政策，蘇聯不會直接威脅到他們的地盤的。與此相反，英美在實際上被日本奪去了上海，香港，菲律賓，荷印群島，以及印度等市塲。在英美的統治者眼光中看來，蘇職的威脅是明日的問題，而日本的威脅却是今日的問題。他們與蘇聯間的矛盾，等到他們與日本間的矛盾解決後，才能辦到議事日程上來，然而他們與日本間的矛盾，卻不能說「慢慢叫」。所以他們與蘇聯間的矛盾，無論怎樣大，但七爆發，卻得結束反日戰爭之後。這一點，在反德戰爭上早已洞若觀火地說明了，希特勒由於過高估計了邱吉爾的反共傾向，以致德國陷於萬刦不復之境。希特勒曾派赫斯飛赴英倫，向邱吉爾提議結成反蘇聯合戰綫。邱吉爾一面立加允諾，而嗾使德國移師北上，反對蘇聯，另一方面則把德國的陰謀統制史太林。這比邱吉爾未耿直的希狀勒，自始至終過份相信了英美同蘇聯間的矛盾，所以甚至在滅亡前德一剎那，→單向英美提出　條件投降的請求。其悲慘結果，業已照吿全世界的人士了。我雖然十分相信，蘇聯與英美間的矛盾，今後將與日但增，但抱必勝決心的日本與英美戰爭指導者間存在着的矛盾，卻達較為大。所以太平洋戰爭業已到達最後決戰階段的今日，日本與英美決不會因蘇聯的未來威脅，而締結妥協。既然日本跟英美渝間的妥協，是不可能的，自然關於蘇聯是否阻　妥協的問題，是根本不會發生的。</p>
<h3>爪哇侯長　日賜贈勳章</h3>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　日天皇下以爪哇，對於日軍政協力有的，特於六月一日賜給二等瑞寶勳章，此事業由賞勳局於二十三日發長。</p>
<h3>美衆院通過　陸軍新預算</h3>
<p>里斯本二十四“中央社電　美衆院預算委員曾，二十二日正式通過陸軍部提出之二百八十五億二十七萬五百九十五美元之新年度預算案。又該會席間，美參謀總長馬歇爾發表謂，重編成對日作戰陸軍部隊，乃當前急務，且爲節省人力及戰爭資材，並副美國民之信賴，我等必須積極對日展開强力攻勢，現陸軍部當局正計劃火規模增强兵力中。</p>
<h3>美軍作戰　損害統計</h3>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　敵於沖繩作戰，流血逐日激增，因此敵陣中之作戰責任論甚囂　上，同時敵高級指揮官之相繼陣亡，在在增多，故敵方苦惱異常，即據敵方之虛偽縮減發表，截止前年末，吉爾伯特作戰約逾一月，計美軍於歐，亞兩戰綫之損害，為十一萬五千名，與是年一月歐洲戰綫突一年間之增加率約為二倍強。去歲初至六月五日開始必阿克島登陸作戰及歐州第二戰綫，當時半年間僅增之十萬八千名，然自寒班島登陸及迭尼安島登陸作戰，雖而敵展開太平洋攻勢之激烈化，至七月七日，計為二十萬七千名。八月六日更增至二十五萬三千名，十月六日即達三十八萬五千名，於此不足三月期間，敵損失已增加三倍以上。十月二十日於雷伊泰島登陸後，約半個月即十一月七日，己爲四十五萬四千名，至十二月十四日已達五十四萬各。今年又於硫黃島登陸作戰，所遭慘重損害，據敵方發表，至三月末爲八十萬九千五百八十七名，四月一日更開始沖繩本島登陸作戰，計敵之損害至六月十五日，達一百另一萬七千九十名，再加截至六月一日止，陣亡二十三萬二千一百四十七名，則自去年六月敵開始塞班島登陸以後，敵之太平洋攻勢以“本土爲目標展開以來，敵方損害，總計其一年間，即增加十倍，陣亡者合計約增八倍，與自前年二月至去年六月，約一年　之總計損害，約達二倍以上。依此即可知最近一年來之敵方損失已急遽上昇，故敵軍愈接近日本本王，則流血愈益增加，因之呼號於日本本土登陸，强行盲目轟炸手段，不過敵軍陣營終亦不能掩飾州此種莫大流血之苦痛敎訓。</p>
<h3>渝靑年軍　編成實況</h3>
<p>中央社訊　渝方鑒於欲達到抗日救國之目的，必有賴於愛國青年之奮起，曾於去年　著手徵券靑年軍，迄今已編成二〇二師，二〇四師，二〇七師，二〇八師，二〇九師等六師，約十萬兵力，調往贛州。漢中，彬縣，昆明等各地。惟此項青年華之實况究如何，最近西安出版之華西日報，曾將此中消息透露，並且延安新華社電曾加以苛刻之批許，茲介紹其大要如次：重慶國民黨於去年十月爲增厚黨軍之勢力起見，以抗日愛國爲號召，吸引一般靑年，曉以靑年不從軍中國即不能冀求新生獨立，動員一切黨機關與宣傳團體，大事活動，迨至年底截止時，人數仍未達預定之半額，送迅速改變原來方針，對於一般超過年齡者及體格不合者，亦予以通融採用，且更延長其限期，抑低從軍之資格，有初級中學程度即可，更散布將停止各學校之空氣，但仍感不足，乃採用强制抽籤及分派等辦法，以編成十萬兵士。故其中不乏十五歲之小學生，甚至編成童子中隊，迨近年又繼續在各地强制徵募。渝方所慣用之徵券優待條件，　一切待遇與駐渝美軍　同，支給其牛汕，麵包，美國烟捲。　招待觀覽美國電影。　入隊時對於其家族支給萬元臨時津貼。　予以將來留學美國之優先權利。　職業界之靑年有志從軍者，按月發給其原服務處之同額薪金。　從軍者之姓各刻碑，保存於其原籍地之禮。　由軍當局保障之等，均屬口惠而實不至之美名。蔣介石躬自表示，視此項靑年軍為子弟，　護如手足云云，以資鼓勵，但實際爲　集此項從軍靑年之家族津貼與優待費，使一般人民負担極大，如陝西省派定爲四億元，每戶須負担二萬元。又靑年軍人方面，於領款時被地方之軍機關不法扣減，致不能領道中央角定之數額，旅費及家族津貼本定為五萬五千元，但一旦出發時，忽被滅低，僅到手三萬元，此蓋被幹部收取手續費，而飽私　矣。各地為此舉出征之青年舉行慰勞壯行會，但縣政府所籌策之壯行會費，悉雲散　消，使用於原來之目的者，不及會費十分之一，又如家族　貼，殆無法人手，故大部士兵大抗不平，粉投函於非渝方所辦之各黨報紙，向政府提抗議。又靑年一經從軍全部那被强制使集團加入重慶國民黨籍，假如拒絕入黨，即以　性惡劣為由，加以懲處，甚至被暗殺，此種事件已在數地暴露，渝方藉暗殺工作，急於「﹢軍」，但真的正之中國青年，決不能被軍，係渝方爲防止靑年離反之苦肉計，但所獲效果則適相反，靑年軍內身能有前綫部隊之資格與否尚成疑問，僅具宣傳性之價値而已，於茲可覩渝方苦悶之一面矣。</p>
<h3>皖省當局　厲行煙禁　辦理述保切結</h3>

<p>蚱埠二十四日巾央社電省立蚌埠醫院爲響應禁烟運動起見，特舉辦免費集團成烟，茲己擬訂章則，即日開始登記。凡所有醫藥住院費完全豁免，赤貧者幷由院方供膳，成除後由院方發給證書。</p>

<h3>比政治領袖　晉謁國王</h3>
<p>政局將由新展開</p>
<p>瑞典京城二十四日中央社電　據此間接獲報告：一周來限於僵局之比利時組織新政府問題，或能於日內獲得解決，蓋日前比國至七名重要政黨領袖，業被召至奧地利之薩爾斯堡，與里奧波國王商討各項嚴重問題。現在白魯塞爾各界一面急待七名政治領袖之返歸，一面猜度彼等與里奧波所討論後帶回之各項消息，不外下列三種：　彼等將帶回里奧彼國王決意退位之消息。　里奧波或將要求現在政府之首相阿干　續握住各種權力，直至選舉之後，再依照民意決定各項措　。　里奧波國王將拒絕退位，並要求天主敎政黨維持現有勢力而組織一臨時政府，直至選舉後，再作處置方法。</p>

<h3>英國近東政策　法表示懷疑　黎巴嫩靑年反法示威</h3>
<p>瑞典京城二十四日中央社電據路透社外交訪員於昨日談稱：雖然英國政府曾於週五發表聲明。略謂，「此次駐於里文達之英軍雖曾出而干涉法叙糾紛，實無意欲排擠法軍」云云。而法國當局對英政府之態度終不免懷疑，尤其最近在法國議會中所討論關於里文達之問題時，火部人員均懷疑英國政府之立塲。法國「康培特」新聞報社之某記者曾對本國政府加以抨擊，略謂，「目前英國政府正書夜不息，欲思在里文達地，今此項陰險之政策，正繼續實施中，然倫敦方面一味假意再三保證渠正當之立場」云。故現在巴黎方面對英政府提出聯合會議之建議，暫置之不理。</p>
<p>里斯本二十四日中央社電據貝魯特訊：於週四夜黎巴嫩國內發生初次反法示威舉動，地點在巴爾貝克歷史古蹟之北部拉薩爾·巴爾貝克。據云，於該日深夜，突有黎國靑年十餘人衝至少數法軍之崗位處舉行示威，結果一旗程被折，其餘一無損害，及後該項實為者業經該地憲兵驅散。</p>

<p>南京二十四日中央社電自國府當局爲使米糧運輸圓滑，安定民食，斷然於本月十六日起，撤消米糧移動限制，並停止米統會及一切國體之收買工作後，京滬兩地之米糧來源，較前充沛，黑市售價亦止　向跌，經過情形尚稱良好，人心亦賴以安定。同時人民對於政府今後米糧行政，關注極深，並因此次措置，係臨時救急對策，新榖登塲時，當局將採取何種方針雖未發表，但人民均盼望常局能洞察過去利弊，予以改革。此次實行米糧緊急措置後，能獲得如是效果，足證以往施策之失常，故望富局於新榖登塲後，除對敵地區予以封鎖外，當　可能緩和平區內之統制限度。同時對當局今後收買方針建議如下：　收買機稱務須統一集中，由統一機構實行統收統配。　軍需米務須減至最低限度，亦應由統一機　買賣收配。　收買價格務須顧及農民血本，並儘可能實行物資交換，勿以大量通貨收買，致引起通貨惡性之膨脹。　新榖登塲之秋，即宜及時收買，切忌因循觀望。</p>

<h3>常熟見聞</h3>
<p>— 香粟</p>
<p>常熟北瀕長江，對南通，鄰界蘇錫澄崑各縣，而又有錫滬公路，橫亘左右，常江湖水陸交通之要衝，素稱文化之邦，魚米之鄉，富饒之區，更以具備優越之地理環境，故目前全境人口，集中至九十萬以上。</p>
<p>事變以還，從未有重大軍事行動，又因對外交通不甚發達，致近代文明，未能普及。本邑向爲文物名邦，弦歌舊里，故思想封建，習　閑散，工作之餘，品茗茶園，每逢佳節，輒有騷人墨客之流，　筵唱和於良景之旁。</p>
<p>風景名勝</p>
<p>名勝古跡甚多，如言子墓，仲雍墓，為先賢子游仲雍埋骨之處，在　山小三台北，其上有亭司供休息。處山在城西北一里，居全境中央，古處仲居此故名，為江南遊　勝地，紀略云：「茲山峻拔，嶙峋之狀，畢呈於西，深岩絕壑之幽，獨　於北，西有山塘圍一繞，尚湖襟帶，遊多蘭盡書舫之觀，北有修竹淸泉，長林絕　，遊者多老邁軸之想」，此言極得處山之大概，。　山之上，有三峯寺，居虞山第三峯故名，爲唐代前古剎，又名淸凉寺　。維摩寺以高勝，邑人屈字助修望海樓，凌晨以觀日出，爲處山十八景之」此外尚有劍門，尚湖，逍遙避等均為具歷史性質古蹟。</p>
<p>今於　山之北麓闢為北新公園，東麓闢爲　山公園，佈置淸秀，風景宜人，自朝至暮，遊　集，一股世家子女，消磨終日於公園茶室，對爲第宣力於烽火連天之塲之勇士，早已忘</p>
<p>市況一斑</p>
<p>城國約九里，凡七門，西北跨廬山，城內以寺前，新縣前，縣前諸位最盛·銀行，旅館，酒樓，茶園叢　於此，旅館以培編吉翠園較好，每逢星期例似，大都均在此闢室聚睹作樂，聲勢頗盛。布商集城東，一般布店之門面裝修，五顏六色，宛如電影院，米商集於城南，居民好品茗，茶園如湖園，望山軒等，無不座客常滿，輸船碼頭多在西南二門。</p>
<p>莫城在昆城湖西，相爲莫祁鑄釗之所。福山距沼三十六里，常福山塘人江之口，爲舟楫所集，人烟稠密，每値魚訊，商販尤多。</p>
<p>教育言論</p>
<p>常熟文化自來發　，而現在小學教育亦頗可觀，惟以全縣所有學齡兒童論，失學煮約占十分之八。過去，中等敎育，只有縣立初級中學一所，自民國三十一年起，常熟刷新教育制度開始，對於中等教育，迭經整飭，已稍具典型，處邑之學校敎育及運動，在蘇錫常三省中，名列第二。</p>
<p>近幾月來，以經濟困苦，環境不安定，家長方面惑於謠言，對於子弟之管家亦差，以致各校學生缺課深度，程度低落，學下當局雖一再防範，惟收效甚微。</p>
<p>敎員待遇，大都菲薄，每月最多一萬七八千，此外尚有俸米三斗，但發放無期。目下敎員大都分三類；一爲敎育而執敎，均爲家境優良，對薪津之多少，　不顧及，一爲生活而執敎，則必斤斤於薪津，每月須按期分發，另一爲學問高深，須校方重金聘請者。</p>
<p>「言論在常熟，頗受桎梏，近有某君，在常熟日報發表語言一則，認輕不法行爲，竟遭對方不滿，某君後被扣留，結果在罰款道歉之下了事，總之「笨稈」不及「槍桿」之硬。</p>

<h3>本市上周間　金融市況平穩　米價跌後又見回升</h3>
<p>滬市金融市况，最近一週，經當局　急管理及中儲方面繼續發行第四期金證券，兌付二期黃金立將過去狂風抑制，投機市僧，咸起　心，故烚赤暗市由漲轉平，步趨穩定，至週六雖見回升，但較週一開市仍小，紋銀亦不很如往前之升漲。公債起伏，相差甚劇，買買交易漸狹，蓋投機商恐蹈危險。華股漲跌互見，因銀錢業六底辦理決算關係，銀根告緊，多空買賣，均呈靜觀態度，散戶交易，亦不敢任意活動。週一至週三均在盤旋中，週四一度普遍高漲後，週五復趨低落，週六收盤略呈升漲。華商證交富局對於經紀人拋空交易，殊爲重視，頗欲糾正股市不法買賣，以達穩健投資之途徑。至最近週內工商方而，似有轉入佳境之望。國府對米糧採取緊急措置，撤銷米糧移動限制，同時盟邦當局停止收買軍米後，米糧價格立轉回風，超過一百大關之自米，曾急劇退落六十大關，週五六又回升至八十大關內，若非米　暗中版賣囤積，米似可不致再漲。雜糧麵粉經雜糧業團體舉辦平價公賣，及額外戶口粉配給開始後，亦見回跌。汕　市價雖跌茶微，惟日用品價格並未隨米價而跌落，反見變相高漲，各公司商號門售標價，仍時常改標提高，此誠有遠當局抑平物價之法令，希市政經濟當局密切注意嚴行取締，尤其一般不法商人，藉口發款單難獲現鈔，相繼暗中附加貼水，市民無形中受損匪鮮。</p>

<h3>常熟見聞</h3>
<p>（自第一版轉來）物產富饒</p>
<p>物產富饒</p>
<p>本邑可耕之田共計一百七十餘萬畝，其中水田占一百十萬畝。故農產物以來爲大宗，年產二百二十萬石以上，東北鄉沙地則盛產棉花，棉田四萬五千餘畝，年產八萬餘担，其中以產於常陰沙者爲最佳，西鄉一帶，略有蠶桑之利，年出約四十餘萬斤。近江多潮蕩，故水產極豐饒，人民有專恃網罟爲生計者甚衆。陽澄湖之蟹，黃衣蕩之菱藕均爲特產。西瓜以產於梅李西塘者爲最有名。更有以桂花搗泥成丸而刻之，有極工細者，名日桂花香珠，爲名貴之物。</p>
<p>其他如東南鄉鄉民，編竹為笠，爲各縣農民所必需，行銷甚廣。綠毛烏　及自楊俱爲處山之特產，產量不多，旱北門大街茶花園所養之綠毛烏龜，毛長寸許如靑苔，品之優者，每只價値五六萬元，謂可作　禮，但其中不乏僞造以售者。</p>
<p>人民痛苦</p>
<p>山前　有一派出所，　榮每月薪金僅幾百元，餉米無，遂四出流動設卡，對行旅客商百般留難，滸浦，福山，劉河等地，尤爲彼等之要口，在魚頒上市期內，關卡更多，對所經各漁船，無論滿載或空船，正式許可或走私，凡過卡必須靠船，達到目的後，方事通過，否則藉口留難，稍有申辯，拳足交加。再如農民在收成之後，常被以收捐爲由，任意攫取辛苦所得，不　農民將來生活，如此行爲，數見不鮮。</p>
<p>更有軍警利用本身地位。在鄉區走私米糧，每月達五六十萬擔，數目至鉅，影響軍米收買，農民不能繳足收買量時，遂向他地購買而繳之，故產米地之米價，往往較城區略高，此亦畸形現象也。</p>
<p>砂田糾紛</p>
<p>由於長江之水流關係。每年搞糟約哩許，常熟江邊每年長出數千畝砂　，該灘土質肥沃，可五年不施肥，故最宜種棉，三年後可產稻。長出砂灘，須　築土堤，方可耕植，目下經營　砂田者，有福利，厚德，　豐三大公司，其餘小公司頗多，曾向財政部領有部照。砂田每畝約値八石黃豆，普通者四五石而已。</p>
<p>沙灘長出後，取巧之徒，可不勞而得圍田，即一面向財政部領執照，同時以耕權利與農民交換圍田工程。俟部照領出時，田亦圍成，一般在山將圍成而照未領出之際，將部照賣絕與農民，其後仍以此田更換名義，再向財部領照，謂此田權利仍屬彼，須再出資買照，是以糾紛遂一起，層出不窮，终年不斷。</p>
<p>如　局加以積極整飭，此實增加農產之一新途徑也。</p>

<h3>如何消滅貼現惡風　緊縮通貨於增發現鈔</h3>
<p>— 穆恭</p>
<p>現在上海正處在矛盾的金融狀態中，如因爲物價高漲而求緊縮通貨，另一面却因現鈔缺乏而要求增發籌碼，在這樣矛盾的環境下的確會感覺到應付爲難吧。</p>
<p>在這裏我們先來硏究通貨或籌碼的種類，廣義的通貨並不是單指現鈔而言，它是包括一切票據如支票滙票本票，而現在通行的撥款　亦是類似的一種，因此，所謂通貨者，要包括現鈔支票滙票本票及撥款單，照此說來第一節所述的金融狀態就並不十分矛盾了，因爲要求緊縮的是指一切通貨，而要求增發的却是通貨中之一種－現鈔，有了這樣的解釋，或則也許可求得二全的對策了：就是緊縮其他通貨而增發現鈔。</p>
<p>物價拼命的高騰下，人民已感到應付爲　，而再遭遇現鈔缺乏因之受貼現的剝削，實在再也喘不過氣來，所以我們　要當局絕　禁止貼現，以減少一部分惡性的現鈔儲藏及大部分善意的儲藏（惡性儲藏指謀貼現求利，善意儲藏為謀自己遭受貼現的損失。）同時請多量增發新鈔，爲了便利甚至於立即發行一萬元鈔，行政院已經通過，</p>
<p>發行現鈔是增加通貨的數量，　緊縮通貨是相對的，所以就需要在共他通貨上設法補救，此項補救辦法可謂簡易，就是請中儲緊縮放款，這種辦法，已　幾次三番實行過，而亦會甚有效果，不過收緊後又放寬，致使　效果見而復隱了。</p>
<p>在上述票據中，有新近發現而極通行之撥款單，其地位頗有疑問。所謂撥款單乃銀錢業向中儲或公會撥移款項之票據，專爲同行間調整差額之用，而今各銀行錢莊竟以之代現鈔作爲客戶支款之用，實超出其本質外，非特有　票據法，（票據法無撥款單之名目）抑且有侵法幣的地位，所以希望加以糾正制止，取締其流行在業外人之手，就近來時常發生撥款單糾紛而言，可知其流弊滋多。非立即予以禁止不了。</p>
<h3>消滅貼現之辦法</h3>
<p>— 雲</p>
<p>閱報較本市經濟驚察近日全體出動，已先後拘獲非法貼現罪犯數十名，一律扣押候示嚴辦，又中儲檢査金融事務處，爲安定金融起見，已查有某某金融機關非法貼現之眞憑實據，即行呈部嚴辦云云，一般市民聞此消息，諒必大為欣幸，今後貼現　風或可稍　，惟現鈔缺乏之現象，恐一時尚難消滅，如何解救當前危機，想當局已有相當具體辦法，及繼續嚴厲取締貼現決心，讀者爲市民一份子，對於取締貼現丞盼富局採取緊急排置，以期收更進一步之效果，茲該就管見所及，提出數點，藉供當局參攷：</p>
<p>徹查各行莊現鈔存底及每日支付實數：如有發現私囤現鈔及非法貼現情事，即應依法嚴辦以儆效尤。</p>
<p>調整各行莊領取現鈔數額：中儲行應根據各行莊之實際需要及市塲情形，統盤籌劃。對各行莊之現鈔供應，儘量寬放限額，作合理之調整，務使各行莊現鈔導碼，足供攴付存戶最低限度之提存。</p>
<p>規定各行莊對存戶提現之最　限額：目前各行莊限制存戶提現額，一般爲每日五千元，即每星期至多三萬元，此數實屬過低。愚見以爲最低附度每戶每星期須寬放至十萬元以上，每次得提取三萬至五萬元，如此，　於小額存戶之現鈔需求，得有合理的供應，而金融機關既有明定的限額，亦不致再有任意限制提現，濫發撥單的流弊了。</p>
<p>嚴格限制開發撥。單：査撥款單之發行，原爲便利行莊間巨額款項之支撥，乃一般金融機關因現鈔缺乏，政對存戶提現多改付撥款單，此實一時權宜之計，不料一部份金融業者更承機混水撈魚，故意隱匿現鈔，而以二角以上的高利經營貼現買賣，一面限制提存，濫發撥單，致釀成今日局面，為今之計，當局丞應重新調差各行莊之內容及業務情形，嚴定準發撥款單之資格，其有挖亂金融嫌疑者，即應取銷其發行撥單資格。其次撥單發行之數額，亦應有所限制，每一行莊每日至多發行若干金額，而每一撥單之票面額亦應有相指限制，規定在萬元或五萬元以上始許發行撥單，如次則小額發單可以減少，不致再有三五千元之　款單在市面上流行，其在一萬元以下之教項，各行莊日不得不以現鈔支付，是亦消滅貼現的有效措置。</p>
<p>以上所述，不過官之見，至緊急　置之如何具體實施，深盼賢明當局，以快刀斬亂麻之手段，切實執行，使整個金融機構得以恢復穩固，平民生活得免加重威脅，不禁企予望之</p>

<h3>Exert All Strength to Adapt to the Urgent War Situation: Japan Prepares Necessary Posture; National Volunteer Soldier Service Law Promulgated and Implemented</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – To adapt to the urgency of the war situation, the Japanese government is mobilizing all its national strength to accelerate the preparation of military and necessary facilities, aiming to ensure the integrity of its national territory. The Special Military Measures Law, implemented on May 5th in parts of the Empire where the situation was urgent, is now, in light of the imminent local decisive battle, being applied to the entire territory of the Empire starting from the 19th of this month. This was announced by the Information Bureau on the 23rd. The expansion of the law’s application to the entire territory is a necessary implementation of emergency wartime measures, with the significant aim of preparing for the decisive battle on the mainland and necessary domestic capabilities.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – The Volunteer Soldier Service Law, established by the 87th Japanese Diet, has been approved by His Majesty the Emperor, announced on the 22nd, and implemented immediately. Consequently, the National Volunteer Corps to respond to the mainland decisive battle has been established. The National Volunteer Soldiers, at the request of the state and under the sacred mission of protecting the Imperial Nation, will engage in railway, communication, and production work, or participate in combat alongside the Japanese army. When the law was promulgated, Minister of the Army Anami respectfully submitted a memorial to the throne and broadcast it nationwide via radio on the night of the 23rd, so that all citizens would be aware.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Dispatch to China Completes Defense Array: The United States Tries to Avoid Mainland Decisive Battle</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency) – Despite the repeated valiant fighting of the Japanese garrison in the Battle of Okinawa, the difficult situation continues to intensify. The insatiable aggressive intentions of the enemy United States are becoming increasingly blatant. The congestion of transport ships at the Kerama anchorage and the appearance of mobile units near Miyako Island all indicate preparations for the next operation. The Japanese Army Dispatch to China, responsible for defending the Chinese mainland, has completed an impenetrable defense array against enemy US landing operations. If the US military dares to invade the Chinese mainland, the Japanese army is prepared to inflict a severe blow. Since this spring, the Japanese army in mainland China has been seeking comprehensive measures against US landing operations, and launching preemptive strikes against the Chongqing regime, which frequently calls for a counteroffensive against Japan. First, the North China Dispatch Army inflicted fatal blows on the First and Fifth War Zone armies operating in Henan and Hubei provinces, reducing the US forward bases at Laohekou, Neixiang, and Nanyang. The South China Japanese army also began operations in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces, defeating the Seventh War Zone armies entrenched in the Longnan, Dingnan, and Xunnan areas, unleashing the power of their night combat troops without restraint, causing them to collapse, and paying close attention to the outcome of the Battle of Okinawa. The Chongqing Military General Headquarters in Kunming, facing the impregnable Japanese defensive array, is preparing a counteroffensive posture with Americanized units under its command. He Yingqin is even employing Long Yun as deputy commander-in-chief, hoping to achieve his self-sacrificing strategy. Here, the enemy US is directly aiming its next operational target at the Japanese mainland, while actively disseminating false propaganda, trying to avoid the mainland decisive battle, with the goal of cutting off the Japanese mainland operations and allowing the Japanese army in mainland China to self-destruct. Recent Chongqing newspaper editorials even claim that the next operational target will not be mainland China, but French Indochina, followed by Jeju Island. By annihilating the Japanese army in mainland China and cutting off the connection between the Japanese mainland and the South Seas, they believe their objective can be achieved. Furthermore, when MacArthur was rehearsing mainland landing operations, he made no mention of the expected landing problems in the Pearl River, Hangzhou Bay, and Shandong Peninsula. However, a certain military commentator stated: "Okinawa, including the Ryukyu Islands, is too narrow as a base for attacking the Japanese mainland, and suffers from the disadvantage of being too far away. From this perspective, mainland China is an excellent springboard." Military observers unanimously acknowledge that this base in mainland China is an undeniable threat to the enemy camp. The enemy US, deeply aware of the heavy losses incurred on Iwo Jima and Okinawa, knows that directly implementing operations on the Japanese mainland will face even greater threats. Therefore, their attempt to use Chongqing's manpower and resources to achieve their ambitions is undoubtedly certain. The future actions of the US military may be carried out in any region, but no matter what offensive the Chongqing army attempts in coordination, the mainland fortress will not be moved even slightly, thanks to the abundant fighting spirit of the Japanese soldiers. The Japanese Dispatch Army to China is quietly awaiting the enemy US mainland landing.</p>
<h3>US Military Establishes Tactical Command in Chongqing</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 24th (Central News Agency) – According to reports from Chongqing, the US military stationed in Chongqing will establish a US Military Tactical Command in Chongqing, abolishing the previous US Military Command in Kunming (Commander General Mark Clark). The new command will be headed by General Alexander Patch. The Chongqing side is currently making strenuous efforts to promote the imminent general counteroffensive against Japan, but the Americanized Chongqing army and its strategic capabilities remain significantly weak. For example, in the formation and equipment of the Americanized Chongqing army, mortars are still the main artillery, with only some field guns deployed. Compared to the artillery equipment of a formal US division, which mainly consists of 105mm and 155mm howitzers, and regiments equipped with 75mm and 85mm field guns, the name may be Americanized, but in reality, it is inferior to even a third-rate US division. Regarding its operational methods, smooth logistics are an absolute requirement. However, the Chongqing army relies on the Chongqing-India airlift and the Burma Road, which ultimately suffer from incomplete supply lines and difficult material and ammunition storage, making it impossible to engage in prolonged combat. Therefore, cultivating the combat power of 30 divisions requires a considerable preparation period. Furthermore, Chongqing's attempt to form ten or more Americanized divisions of youth student soldiers has also yielded no results. As a result, the backbone of the Americanized Chongqing army is the First and Second Divisions and the New Sixth Army, which were transferred from Burma, but their combat deployment is also inconsistent. From this, it can be seen that the gap between the propaganda and the reality of Chongqing's counteroffensive against Japan in support of the US mainland landing operations is still large. Pre-Day Air Raid on Balikpapan</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting Near Ruden, Balikpapan Air Raid Yesterday</h3>
<p>Southern Frontline Base, 24th (Central News Agency) – After landing in Balikpapan Bay, the enemy deployed more than a dozen large warships to patrol the seas off Miri, south of Borneo, conducting shelling and mine sweeping reconnaissance. On the 20th, using four transport ships, ten large boats, and thirty landing craft, they began landing near Ruden, 20 kilometers north of Miri. The local Japanese garrison is currently engaged in fierce fighting with them. Since the 18th, Japanese units in the Uisston area on the east coast of Balikpapan Bay have been boldly engaging in close combat with the enemy landing forces, inflicting significant damage.</p>
<p>Southwest Pacific Base, 24th (Central News Agency) – Twenty enemy small aircraft, including P-38 and P-47 types, attacked Balikpapan on the 23rd. The local Japanese units shot down two of them and engaged with enemy ships approaching the island, repelling them.</p>
<p>Mines Dropped in Hakata Bay</p>
<p>Fukuoka, 24th (Central News Agency) – More than ten enemy B-29 aircraft intruded from the sea south of Kagoshima Prefecture from around midnight to 2:40 AM on the 24th. After dropping mines in Hakata Bay, they fled via southern Oita Prefecture.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Upholding the National Policy and the Organs of Public Opinion</h3>
<p>Chairman Chen Dai of the National Government, recognizing the tense situation as being as precarious as a thread hanging by a hair, personally inspected local military and political facilities in Anhui, Huai, and Henan provinces, giving instructions on everything to meet the needs of the current situation and to demonstrate the central government's policies to achieve unity from top to bottom. We feel that this inspection has three significant meanings.</p>
<p>First, we can understand more deeply and clearly the central government's policies under the current situation.</p>
<p>Second, we can recognize the central government's spirit of responsibility for the national situation and the people in all regions.</p>
<p>Third, we can recognize that the coordinated unity of the central and local military and political facilities is sufficient to cope with any environment and implement the central government's national policy.</p>
<p>Through Chairman Chen Dai's inspection of Anhui, Huai, and Henan provinces, the central government's sincere concern for local authorities and staff in all departments will stimulate local officials and people to support the implementation of the central government's national policy and generate a more favorable centripetal effect, which is sufficient to promote political innovation in the peaceful areas and is a major prerequisite for the reconstruction of the whole country.</p>
<p>In his address during the inspection of the troops in Anhui, Huai, and Henan, Chairman Chen Dai clearly stated: "The central government's policy will not change, no matter how urgent the situation is." "What is the central government's policy? Simply put, it is peace, anti-communism, and national reconstruction." This is an extremely simple and clear statement!</p>
<p>At this stage, the central government is implementing the national policy of "peace, anti-communism, and national reconstruction." Chairman Chen Dai also clearly pointed out three points: First, "For the freedom and independence of China and the liberation of East Asia, we must adhere to the original intention of participating in the war, strengthen cooperation, and complete the war." Second, "The anti-communist policy of the National Government has always been, is, and will always be the case." Third, "We must start with internal unity, expand and enrich it to achieve national unity. Only unity can give us strength, and only strength can shoulder greater tasks." These three major policies for implementing the national policy have completely eliminated the various rumors circulating recently. At the same time, they pointed out the great path for officials and civilians to strive together. We must unite our strength and move forward towards our common great goal.</p>
<p>We support the central government's national policy and implementation guidelines. However, we believe that there is a basic prerequisite for rapidly realizing this major policy, which is to first obtain the genuine support of the broad masses of the people, so that the people can fully understand the government's policies and have the opportunity to express and provide opinions on the government's policies. Therefore, establishing organs of public opinion is a necessity that must be realized as soon as possible. Taking Shanghai as an example, since the establishment of the Municipal Advisory Committee, although it cannot be said to be a genuine organ of public opinion and there are still many areas where it has not been able to fully exert the mission of an organ of public opinion, in practice, it has made considerable achievements in cooperating with the municipal government's policy implementation and in providing suggestions for alleviating the people's hardships.</p>
<p>The establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Advisory Committee was facilitated by Chairman Chen Dai during his tenure as Mayor of Shanghai, which further demonstrates Chairman Chen Dai's emphasis on organs of public opinion. Now that Chairman Chen Dai is in charge of central government affairs, we hope even more that central organs of public opinion can be established as soon as possible. At the same time, local organs of public opinion at all levels can also be established simultaneously. It is reported that the Zhejiang Provincial Government is actively preparing to establish a public consultation mechanism, and it is hoped that other provinces will follow suit.</p>
<h3>Casual Chats from the Veranda</h3>
<p>— Yoshida Toyosuke</p>
<p>The Soviet Union and the Chinese Revolution</p>
<p>Q: But if the Soviet Union does not participate in the Pacific War and the Pacific War is declared over, will the position established by the CCP in this war not also be eliminated? As soon as the War of Resistance Against Japan ends, Chongqing will immediately prepare to launch a civil war in order to unify the country. The CCP also made this a major issue to discuss at the Seventh National Congress. Mao Zedong once stated in Dagongbao: "After the Chongqing Kuomintang government relies on American power to defeat Japan, it will repeat the same ugly drama of the Greek government-in-exile borrowing the strength of the country to eliminate the Greek guerrillas, slaughtering our compatriots." If the Soviet Union were to send troops to China to save the CCP from this misfortune, would not Soviet participation in the Pacific War itself be the most likely way to reduce friction between the Kuomintang and the Communists?</p>
<p>A: Of course, the Soviet Union hopes that the like-minded CCP will become the master of China. However, the Soviet Union also knows that the currently recognized government of China is Chongqing, not Yan'an. No matter how the CCP says that the Chongqing government is a bad government that has been abandoned by the people, as long as Chongqing has the recognition of the people as its government, Soviet aid to Yan'an and hostility towards Chongqing will be regarded as interfering in China's internal affairs. Therefore, no matter how concerned the Soviet Union is about the Chinese revolution, Stalin has no intention of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries by force. The Chinese revolution, viewed from any perspective, is unanimously recognized as the most dominant factor in the liberation of Asia. The Chinese revolution is closely and inseparably related to the independence and liberation of India. As long as the Chinese revolution succeeds, India will naturally get rid of the shackles of Britain. If the British Empire loses India, it will actually be equivalent to the aristocracy losing their hereditary fiefdom and becoming paupers. Therefore, when the Soviet Union was still under the influence of Trotsky's "permanent revolution theory," it regarded the Chinese revolution as the most important issue in the Soviet Union's world revolution policy. Since Stalin negated Trotsky's "permanent revolution theory" and raised the banner of "building socialism in one country," the Chinese revolution has been removed from the Soviet Union's main concern. However, it goes without saying that the Chinese revolution is still one of the Soviet Union's most important issues. No matter how much Stalin cares about the revolutions of small countries, he believes that the responsibility for the Chinese revolution still lies with the Chinese people themselves. If, as the Chinese Communist Party says, the Chongqing government is a coalition government of landlords, warlords, and capitalists and must be overthrown, then the execution of this task lies with the broad masses of the Chinese people themselves. For example, someone declares "not to recognize Chiang Kai-shek," but as long as Chiang Kai-shek is in fact supported by the Chinese people, then Chiang Kai-shek's regime is still the government of China. Therefore, the position taken by the Soviet Union is that the Chinese revolution should be carried out by the Chinese people themselves according to their own needs. Communism can certainly be said to be the doctrine that has transformed previously defeated Russia into today's victorious Soviet Union, but it is absolutely impossible to allow China to accept this communism without any changes. Although there is a faction of communism in China with the same name, it must be specifically adapted to China's objective economic conditions and developed and promoted by the Chinese themselves. Historically, it can be seen that even progressive and outstanding political ideas, when forcibly imported into a country where economic conditions are not yet fully developed, are not accepted by the people of that country, but are instead desperately resisted. Napoleon's occupation of Spain is one example. After Napoleon destroyed the old political system of Spain, he wanted to implement the new system of the French Revolution in Spain. However, the Spanish people regarded Napoleon, who called himself a "liberator," as an invader of another race, and armed uprisings broke out everywhere. As a result, the modern army of France, which was then considered the world's best, was driven out of the country by the guerrillas of the Spanish people. Later, this war method became more and more noticeable to the world. Today, guerrilla warfare is called "Guerilla warfare," which actually comes from the French word "Cuerilus." The initial meaning of the word referred to the war in Spain at that time. This is straying too far from the topic. To return to the topic, Stalin is probably unlikely to imitate Napoleon and repeat the Spanish historical drama in China!</p>
<p>Is a Compromise Possible Between Japan and Chongqing?</p>
<p>Q: But you also admit that since the Soviet Union hopes that the CCP will control China, it will naturally oppose the conclusion of a comprehensive peace between Chongqing and Japan. Therefore, when Chongqing wants to compromise with Japan, the Soviet Union will definitely use some means to prevent and disrupt it. Based on this point, when a comprehensive peace between Chongqing and Japan seems likely, perhaps the Soviet Union will use participation in the war to prevent it from being realized!</p>
<p>A: At present, the Soviet Union believes that a comprehensive peace between the Chongqing regime and Japan is impossible. Because, first of all, according to the current situation, it is impossible for Chongqing and Japan to make peace separately, while the United States and Japan are still at war. Second, the Soviet Union knows that there is no room for compromise between the current war leaders of the United States and the leaders of Japan. We will explore the first issue in more detail.</p>
<p>In general, people believe that the Chongqing government's foreign policy has long been following Washington's lead for the past two or three years. I do not deny the burgeoning nationalist forces in China by saying this. Even if two or three leaders in Chongqing are bought by the United States and the policies of Chongqing are controlled by them, if such a national policy endangers China's independence and autonomy, the Chinese people will never stop there, and at the same time, the Chongqing government will not be able to extinguish all the elements of domestic dissatisfaction. Even if Chongqing's diplomacy formally seems to be following Washington's decision, it can only be implemented without hindrance when it is beneficial to China's independence and autonomy. If it deviates from this line, it will inevitably cause fierce criticism from intellectuals, causing it to return to its original line. This is a depiction of the current situation in Chongqing. On this point, Chongqing's diplomacy can still be said to be determined by Chongqing itself. Someone will definitely think that the Sino-Japanese separate peace may be possible as long as China’s diplomatic policies are determined by Chongqing itself and not by Washington. But my view is just the opposite. Precisely because Chongqing's diplomacy is not determined by Washington, a negative conclusion is reached, that is, under the current situation, a separate peace is more impossible. It is true that some people in Chongqing can imagine that after Japan is destroyed, the United States will take off its mask of hypocrisy towards China in the past and reveal its original ferocious face. These people also believe that it is tantamount to an ant trying to stop a cart if they rely solely on the strength of Chongqing to deal with the United States in the future. So, they want to prepare for a rainy day and seek a compromise with Japan first (in this case, they think that Japan is an anti-aggressor). However, under the current circumstances, Japan only wants to fight to the death with the United States, then Chongqing has no room to consider a compromise. Even if there are still such compromisers in the Chongqing authorities to some extent now, it is impossible to make China's national policy move in this direction.</p>
<p>Is a Compromise Possible Between Japan and the US?</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about the second question. Then, is there any possibility of a compromise between the United States and Japan? Some people place this hope in the contradiction between the Soviet Union and Britain and the United States in solving European problems, and in the development of the Yalta Conference’s contradictions. Of course, no one can deny that there are contradictions between the policies of the Soviet Union and Britain and the United States. Some parts of the British and American ruling class are extremely afraid of the rise of the Soviet Union in their hearts. This is a fact. These people feel that after the Soviet Union becomes strong, it will affect the gradual disintegration of their own territory. In contrast, Britain and the United States have actually had their markets taken away by Japan: Shanghai, Hong Kong, the Philippines, the Dutch East Indies, and even India. In the eyes of British and American rulers, the threat from the Soviet Union is a matter of tomorrow, while the threat from Japan is a matter of today. Their contradictions with the Soviet Union can only be put on the agenda after their contradictions with Japan have been resolved. However, their contradictions with Japan cannot be said to be able to be solved at a leisurely pace. So, no matter how big their contradictions with the Soviet Union are, they have to erupt, but they have to end after the anti-Japanese war. This point has already been clearly explained in the anti-German war. Hitler fell into a point of no return because he overestimated Churchill's anti-communist tendencies. Hitler sent Hess to Britain to propose an anti-Soviet united front to Churchill. Churchill immediately promised to let Germany move north to oppose the Soviet Union. On the other hand, he informed Stalin of Germany's conspiracy. Hitler, who was less direct than Churchill, always overestimated the contradictions between the United States and the Soviet Union. Therefore, even at the last moment before his demise, he only offered unconditional surrender to the United States and Britain. Its tragic outcome has already been told to people all over the world. Although I firmly believe that the contradictions between the Soviet Union and the United States and Britain will only increase day by day, the contradictions between Japan and the war leaders of Britain and the United States, who are determined to win, are greater. Therefore, since the Pacific War has reached the final decisive stage, Japan and Britain and the United States will never conclude a compromise because of the future threat of the Soviet Union. Since the compromise between Japan and the United States and Chongqing is impossible, naturally the question of whether the Soviet Union is preventing the compromise will not arise at all.</p>
<h3>Javanese Marquis Granted Japanese Medal</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – His Majesty the Emperor of Japan has granted the Second Class Order of the Sacred Treasure on June 1 to a Javanese marquis for his cooperation with the Japanese military administration. The award was announced by the Decoration Bureau on the 23rd.</p>
<h3>US House Passes New Army Budget</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency) – The US House Budget Committee formally passed the Army Department's proposed new fiscal year budget of $28.527 billion on the 22nd. During the meeting, US Chief of Staff Marshall stated that reorganizing the Army forces for the war against Japan is an urgent task. To save manpower and war materials and to live up to the trust of the American people, we must actively launch a strong offensive against Japan. The current Army Department authorities are planning to significantly increase troop strength.</p>
<h3>American Military Operations - Damage Statistics</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – The enemy's casualties in the Okinawa operations are increasing daily, leading to widespread debate within their ranks regarding responsibility for the operations. Furthermore, the successive deaths of high-ranking enemy commanders are on the rise, causing exceptional distress to the enemy. Even according to the enemy's false and reduced figures, as of the end of the previous year, the Gilbert Islands operation, which lasted about a month, resulted in the loss of 115,000 American soldiers on both the European and Asian fronts. The increase in casualties on the European front during the following year was roughly twice as high. From the beginning of last year to June 5th, with the commencement of the Biak Island landing operation and the second European front, the increase was only 108,000 in half a year. However, from the Hollandia landing and the Tinian Island landing operations, and with the intensification of the enemy's Pacific offensive, the total reached 207,000 by July 7th. By August 6th, it further increased to 253,000, and by October 6th, it reached 385,000. In this period of less than three months, the enemy's losses more than tripled. After the landing on Leyte Island on October 20th, in about half a month, by November 7th, the figure was already 454,000, and by December 14th, it reached 540,000. This year, the heavy casualties suffered during the Iwo Jima landing operation, according to the enemy's figures, amounted to 809,587 by the end of March. On April 1st, the landing operation on Okinawa Island began, and the enemy's losses reached 1,017,090 by June 15th. Furthermore, with 232,147 deaths as of June 1st, the enemy's total losses during its Pacific offensive, which began with the Saipan landing last June, aimed at the "mainland," increased tenfold in one year, with the number of deaths increasing roughly eightfold. This is more than twice the total losses from February of the previous year to June of last year, covering approximately one year. From this, it is clear that the enemy's losses have been rapidly increasing in the past year. As the enemy army approaches the Japanese mainland, the bloodshed will continue to increase. Therefore, their calls for a landing on the Japanese mainland and their forceful, indiscriminate bombing tactics are merely attempts to conceal the painful lesson of such immense bloodshed from their own camp.</p>
<h3>Actual Situation of the Youth Army in Chongqing</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch: The Chongqing authorities, recognizing that achieving the goals of resisting Japan and saving the nation depends on the rise of patriotic youth, began recruiting a Youth Army last year. To date, six divisions, including the 202nd, 204th, 207th, 208th, and 209th Divisions, totaling approximately 100,000 troops, have been formed and deployed to various locations, including Ganzhou, Hanzhong, Bin County, and Kunming. However, the actual situation of this Youth Army remains a question. Recently, the Huaxi Daily, published in Xi'an, revealed some information, which was also severely criticized by the Yan'an Xinhua News Agency. A summary of the main points is as follows: In October of last year, the Chongqing Kuomintang, seeking to bolster the strength of its party army, used the slogans of resisting Japan and loving the country to attract young people, convincing them that China could not achieve new life and independence unless young people joined the military. They mobilized all party organs and propaganda groups to carry out large-scale activities. By the end of the year, the number of recruits still did not reach half of the projected quota. They quickly changed their original policy, and even those who were overage or physically unqualified were given lenient acceptance, and the deadline was extended. The qualifications for joining the military were lowered to a junior high school education. Rumors were spread that schools would be closed. Still feeling that it was not enough, they resorted to forced lottery and assignment methods to form an army of 100,000 soldiers. Consequently, there were many 15-year-old elementary school students, and even children's platoons were formed. In recent years, forced recruitment has continued in various places. The preferential conditions habitually used by Chongqing for recruitment were: All treatment is the same as that of the US military stationed in Chongqing, with supplies of butter, bread, and American cigarettes. Free admission to American movies. A temporary allowance of ten thousand yuan is given to the family upon enlistment. Priority for future study in the United States. For young people in professional fields who are willing to join the military, their original salary is paid monthly by their former employer. The names of those who join the military are engraved on steles and preserved in their hometown. Guarantees are provided by the military authorities, etc. These are all empty promises and empty reputations. Chiang Kai-shek himself expressed that he regarded this Youth Army as his own children, protecting them as his own hands and feet, to encourage them. But in reality, the family allowances and preferential treatment for this recruited Youth Army placed a huge burden on the general population. For example, Shaanxi Province was assigned a quota of 400 million yuan, with each household having to bear 20,000 yuan. Moreover, Youth Army soldiers had their money illegally deducted by local military authorities when receiving payments, preventing them from receiving the full amount stipulated by the central government. Travel expenses and family allowances were originally set at 55,000 yuan, but suddenly reduced to only 30,000 yuan upon departure. This was apparently due to cadres collecting "handling fees" and enriching themselves. Various places held consolation and send-off rallies for the youth who enlisted in the military, but the funds raised by the county governments for these rallies all vanished, with less than one-tenth of the funds being used for their original purpose. Family allowances were also difficult to obtain. As a result, most soldiers strongly protested and sent letters to non-Chongqing-affiliated newspapers to protest to the government. Once enlisted, young people were forcibly made to join the Chongqing Kuomintang en masse. If they refused to join the party, they would be punished on the grounds of "bad character," and even assassinated. Such incidents have been exposed in several places. Chongqing relies on assassination to urgently "supplement the army," but the truly righteous Chinese youth cannot be deceived. This is a desperate trick by Chongqing to prevent youth from rebelling, but the effect is just the opposite. Whether the Youth Army is qualified for front-line service is still questionable, and it only has propaganda value. From this, one can see the anguish of Chongqing.</p>

<h3>Belgian Political Leaders Meet with the King</h3>
<p>A New Phase of the Political Situation Will Unfold</p>
<p>Stockholm, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to reports received here, the problem of forming a new Belgian government, which has been in a stalemate for a week, may be resolved within days. Seven important political party leaders from Belgium were summoned to Salzburg, Austria, to discuss various serious issues with King Leopold. Now, various sectors in Brussels are eagerly awaiting the return of the seven political leaders, while speculating on the information they will bring back after their discussions with Leopold. There are three possibilities: They will bring back the news of King Leopold's decision to abdicate. Leopold may ask the current Prime Minister, Agan, to continue holding all powers until the election, and then decide on various measures according to public opinion. King Leopold will refuse to abdicate and demand that the Catholic political party maintain its current power and form a provisional government until after the election, and then make a decision.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to the Brussels Gazette, Belgian Ambassador to London, Lord Makin, has just proceeded to meet with King Leopold in Salzburg for talks.

<h3>Britain's Near East Policy - France Expresses Doubt - Lebanese Youth Demonstrate Against France</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to a Reuters diplomatic correspondent yesterday, although the British government issued a statement on Friday, stating that "although the British troops stationed in Lebanon intervened in the French-Syrian dispute, there was no intention to squeeze out the French troops," the French authorities inevitably remain suspicious of the British government's attitude, especially during the recent discussions in the French Parliament regarding the issue of Lebanon, where all officials doubted the British government's position. A journalist from the French "Compeed" newspaper criticized his government, saying, "Currently, the British government is working day and night to try to infiltrate Lebanon, and this insidious policy is continuing to be implemented, but London is insincerely and repeatedly guaranteeing its legitimate position." Therefore, Paris is currently ignoring the British government's proposal for a joint meeting.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to a dispatch from Beirut: On Thursday night, the first anti-French demonstration took place in Lebanon, at Ras Baalbek, north of the historical site of Baalbek. It is said that late that night, more than a dozen Lebanese youths rushed to the posts of a small number of French troops to demonstrate. As a result, one flag was broken, but otherwise there was no damage. Afterwards, the demonstrators were dispersed by the local military police.</p>

<p>The National Government's Reform of Grain Policy Achieves Good Results - Four Suggestions for the Purchase Policy</p>
<p>Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Since the National Government authorities, in order to facilitate smooth grain transportation and stabilize the people's food supply, decisively abolished the restrictions on grain movement from the 16th of this month, and stopped the purchase work of the Rice Management Committee and all state-owned entities, the source of grain in Nanjing and Shanghai has become more abundant than before, and the black market price has also stopped rising and started to fall. The situation is generally good, and people's hearts are also stabilized. At the same time, the people are deeply concerned about the government's future grain administration. Because this measure is a temporary emergency countermeasure, the authorities have not announced what kind of policies will be adopted when the new grain comes on the market, but the people hope that Changju can understand the advantages and disadvantages of the past and reform them. The fact that such effects can be obtained after the implementation of the emergency measures for grain this time proves the abnormality of the previous policies. Therefore, after the new grain comes on the market, it is hoped that the rich bureaus, in addition to blockading the enemy areas, will be able to relax the degree of unified restriction in the peaceful areas. At the same time, the following suggestions are made to the authorities for future purchase policies: The purchase mechanisms must be unified and concentrated, and unified collection and distribution must be implemented by a unified institution. Military grain needs must be reduced to the minimum extent, and it should also be bought, sold, collected and distributed by a unified institution. The purchase price must take into account the cost of farmers, and it should be possible to carry out material exchange as much as possible, and not purchase with a large amount of currency, so as not to cause vicious inflation. In the autumn when the new grain comes on the market, it should be purchased in time, and avoid procrastination and wait-and-see.</p>

<h3>What I Saw and Heard in Changshu</h3>
<p>— Xiang Su</p>
<p>Changshu is located north of the Yangtze River, facing Nantong, and adjacent to the counties of Su, Xi, Cheng, and Kun. The Xi-Hu Highway runs horizontally across it. Changshu is a vital communication hub for both river and land transportation. It has long been known as a land of culture, a land of fish and rice, and a rich area. Furthermore, it has a superior geographical environment, so the current population of the entire territory is concentrated to over 900,000 people.</p>
<p>Since the war, there have been no major military actions. Also, because external transportation is not very developed, modern civilization has not been popularized. This county has always been a famous cultural place, a former home of string music. Therefore, thoughts are feudal, habits are leisurely, and after work, people sip tea in tea gardens. Every festival, there are often scholars and poets who feast and write in harmony beside the beautiful scenery.</p>
<p>Scenery and Historical Sites</p>
<p>There are many famous scenic spots and historical sites, such as the tombs of Yanzi and Zhongyong, which are the burial places of the ancient sages Ziyou and Zhongyong, located on the northern side of Yushan, at Xiaosantai, which have pavilions for rest. Yushan is located one mile northwest of the city, in the center of the entire territory. It is named after Zhongyong, who lived here in ancient times. It is a famous scenic spot for tourism in Jiangnan. Jilue said: "This mountain is steep and towering, and its jagged state is fully displayed in the west. The seclusion of deep cliffs and valleys is unique in the north. To the west, a mountain pond surrounds it, and Shang Lake is like a belt, and tourists mostly enjoy the sight of boats full of books. To the north, there are slender bamboos and clear springs, and long forests and secluded valleys, and tourists mostly imagine old-age retreats." This statement captures the essence of Yushan. On top of Yushan, there is the Sanfeng Temple, named after the third peak of Yushan. It is an ancient temple from the Tang Dynasty, also known as Qingliang Temple. The Weimo Temple is known for its height. A local resident named Qu Zizhu renovated the Wanghai Tower to watch the sunrise at dawn. It is one of the eighteen views of Yushan." In addition, there are also Jianmen, Shang Lake, and Xiaoyao Bi, which are all historical sites.</p>
<p>Today, the northern foot of Yushan has been developed into Beixin Park, and the eastern foot has been developed into Yushan Park. The layout is elegant and the scenery is pleasant. From morning to night, tourists gather. Some wealthy families spend the whole day in the park's tea rooms, and the warriors who are fighting for the country in the war-torn field are long forgotten.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Market</p>
<p>The city is about nine li in circumference, with seven gates. The northwest side crosses Mount Lu. The areas in the city in front of the Temple, in front of the New County, and in front of the County are the most prosperous. Banks, hotels, restaurants, and tea gardens are clustered here. The Peibian Jicui Garden is a relatively good hotel. Every week on their days off, most people gather here to gamble and have fun. The cloth merchants gather in the east of the city. The storefronts of general cloth shops are decorated in various colors, like movie theaters. The rice merchants gather in the south of the city. Residents like to sip tea, and tea gardens such as Lake Garden and Wangshanxuan are always full of customers. Most of the transport docks are in the southwest two gates.</p>
<p>Mocheng is located west of Kuncheng Lake. It is the place where Mo Qi and Zhu Zhao were cast. Fushan is thirty-six li away from the swamp. Changfu Shantangren Jiang's mouth is a gathering place for boats and ships, and the population is dense. Whenever there is fish news, there are even more merchants.</p>
<p>Education and Public Opinion</p>
<p>Changshu's culture has always been well-developed, and the current elementary education is also quite remarkable. However, judging from the total number of school-age children in the county, the number of children who are out of school accounts for about eight-tenths. In the past, there was only one county-run junior high school for secondary education. Since 1942, when Changshu began to reform the education system, secondary education has been reorganized many times and has become slightly typical. The school education and sports in Yi County rank second among the three provinces of Su, Xi, and Chang.</p>
<p>In recent months, due to economic difficulties, unstable environment, and parents being confused by rumors, the family management of children has also been poor, resulting in deep absenteeism and low levels of academic performance among students in various schools. Although the school authorities have repeatedly taken precautions, the effect has been minimal.</p>
<p>The salaries of teachers are generally meager, with a maximum of 17,000 to 18,000 per month, plus three dou of salary rice, but the distribution is indefinite. At present, teachers are generally divided into three categories: one is those who teach for education, who are generally from good families and do not care about the amount of salary; one is those who teach for a living, who must be exacting about their salary and must be paid on time every month; and another is those who are highly educated and must be hired by the school with a large sum of money.</p>
<p>"Freedom of speech in Changshu is quite restricted. Recently, a gentleman published a language in the Changshu Daily, which recognized illegal behavior. The person was dissatisfied, and was subsequently detained. As a result, the matter was settled with a fine and an apology. In short, the "pen" is not as hard as the "gun."</p>

<h3>The Financial Market in the City was Stable Last Week. Rice Prices Rose Again After Falling.</h3>
<p>The financial market in Shanghai, in the past week, under the emergency management of the authorities and the continued issuance of the fourth phase of gold securities by the Central Reserve, and the payment of the second phase of gold was imminent, the previous storm was suppressed, and speculators began to withdraw. Therefore, the private market was changed from rising to leveling off, and moved towards stability. Although it rebounded on Saturday, it was still smaller than the opening on Monday. Silver did not rise as much as it had in the past. The fluctuations of public bonds were very different, and buying and selling transactions gradually narrowed, because speculators were afraid of danger. Hua shares showed mixed gains and losses. Because the silver money industry handled the settlement at the end of June, the money supply was tight, and both long and short sales showed a wait-and-see attitude. Retail transactions also did not dare to move arbitrarily. From Monday to Wednesday, they were all hovering. After a general rise on Thursday, they fell again on Friday, and the closing on Saturday showed a slight rise. The Stock Exchange of the China Merchants Bureau attached great importance to the short selling transactions of brokers, and wanted to correct the illegal buying and selling in the stock market to achieve a sound investment path. In the recent week, the industrial and commercial sectors seem to be turning for the better. After the National Government took emergency measures on rice and abolished the restrictions on rice movement, and at the same time, the Allied forces stopped buying military rice, rice prices immediately turned around. The self-rice that exceeded the 100 mark once fell sharply to the 60 mark. On Friday and Saturday, it rose again to within the 80 mark. If the rice dealers were not secretly selling and hoarding, it seems that the rice would not rise again. After the grain and flour industry groups held public sales at parity prices and the extra household powder allocation began, the prices of miscellaneous grains and flour also fell. Although the price of oil has fallen slightly, the prices of daily necessities have not fallen with the price of rice, but have risen in disguise. The door sale price tags of various companies and shops are still often changed to increase prices. This is indeed a law to suppress and equalize the prices of goods by the authorities. It is hoped that the municipal economic authorities will pay close attention and strictly investigate and deal with it, especially the general illegal merchants, who take the opportunity to issue cash-out orders that are difficult to obtain cash, and secretly add premiums one after another, and the citizens are invisibly damaged.</p>
<h3>Money Industry Revises Check Return Time</h3>
<p>The check return time of the silver money industry in this city was determined in the spring of this year to resume the previous method from Monday to Friday, until 7:00 PM, and until 5:00 PM on Saturday. Now, the industry association, because the business hours of the members of the industry have been changed to 1:00 PM from Monday to Saturday since the 18th of this month, which is two hours earlier than before, and the check return time of the industry has also been advanced to 5:00 PM, but the association believes that the check return time is too late, and it is inevitable to wait for a long time. If it is raised too early, it is inconvenient for the industry. Therefore, it was decided that from the 21st of this month, the check return time of the industry will be changed to 6:00 PM from Monday to Saturday, and all members have been notified to comply.</p>

<h3>News from Changshu</h3>
<p>(Continued from the first page) Rich in Products</p>
<p>Rich in Products</p>
<p>The county has a total of more than 1.7 million mu of arable land, of which 1.1 million mu are paddy fields. Therefore, agricultural products have always been the main products, with an annual output of more than 2.2 million dan. The sandy land in the northeast is rich in cotton, with more than 45,000 mu of cotton fields, with an annual output of more than 80,000 dan. The best is produced in Changyinsha. There are slight sericulture benefits in the western township, with an annual output of about 400,000 catties. The river near the Yangtze River is often flooded, so aquatic products are extremely rich. Many people rely on fishing nets for their livelihoods. Yangcheng Lake crabs and Huangyidang water caltrops are special products. Watermelons produced in Meili Xitang are the most famous. There are also those who pound osmanthus into mud and form pills, which are carved with extremely fine details, called osmanthus fragrant beads, which are precious items.</p>
<p>Other products, such as the villagers in the southeast township, weave bamboo into hats, which are necessary for farmers in various counties, and are sold widely. Green-haired turtles and Ziyang are both special products of Chushan, with low yields. The green-haired turtles raised in the Camellia Garden on Hanbei Men Street have hairs that are an inch long, like green moss. The best ones are worth 50,000 to 60,000 yuan each, and they are said to be used as gifts, but there are many fakes sold.</p>
<p>People's Suffering</p>
<p>There is a police station in Shanqian. The monthly salary of the policeman is only a few hundred yuan, and there is no rice allowance. Therefore, they move around and set up checkpoints, making things difficult for travelers and merchants. Hupu, Fushan, and Liuhe are their main crossings. During the period when fish are listed, there are more checkpoints. All fishing boats passing through the card, whether full or empty, officially licensed or smuggled, must lean on the boat to pass, otherwise they will make excuses to make things difficult. If there is any defense, they will use fists and feet. In addition, after the harvest, farmers are often arbitrarily seized of their hard-earned income in the name of collecting donations, regardless of the future life of the farmers. Such behavior is common.</p>
<p>Some military and police officers use their position to smuggle rice and grain in rural areas, reaching 500,000 to 600,000 dan per month, which is a huge amount, affecting the purchase of military rice. When farmers cannot pay enough for the purchase amount, they buy it from other places and pay it. Therefore, the price of rice in the rice-producing area is often slightly higher than in the urban area, which is also an abnormal phenomenon.</p>
<p>Sand Field Disputes</p>
<p>Due to the relationship between the water flow of the Yangtze River. Every year, about 100 mu of arable land is generated. Several thousand mu of sand beaches grow along the Yangtze River in Changshu every year. The soil of the beach is fertile and can be planted without fertilizer for five years, so it is most suitable for growing cotton, and rice can be produced after three years. After the sand beach grows, it must be built with earth dikes before it can be cultivated. At present, there are three major companies, namely, Welfare, Houde, and Feng, that operate sand fields, and there are many other small companies. They have obtained business licenses from the Ministry of Finance. The value of each mu of sand field is about eight dan of soybeans, and the average is four or five dan.</p>
<p>After the beach grows, those who are tricky can get the enclosed field without any effort, that is, they apply for a license from the Ministry of Finance on one hand, and exchange the enclosed field project with the farmers in the name of the right to cultivate. When the ministry's license is issued, the field is also enclosed. Generally, when the mountain will be enclosed but the license has not been issued, the ministry's license is sold to the farmers. After that, the license is applied to the Ministry of Finance again in the name of replacing the field. It is said that the right to this field still belongs to him, and he must pay for the license again, so disputes arise one after another and continue throughout the year.</p>
<p>If the Land Bureau actively rectifies it, this is indeed a new way to increase agricultural production.</p>

<h3>How to Eliminate the Evil Practice of Discounting: Tighten Currency While Increasing Cash Issuance</h3>
<p>— Mu Gong</p>
<p>Shanghai is now in a contradictory financial state. For example, due to the high price increase, it is necessary to tighten the currency, but on the other hand, due to the lack of cash, it is necessary to increase the issuance of tokens. In such a contradictory environment, it is indeed difficult to cope with.</p>
<p>Here, let us first study the types of currency or tokens. Currency in a broad sense does not only refer to cash. It includes all instruments such as checks, drafts, and promissory notes, and the currently popular allocation is also a similar type. Therefore, the so-called currency includes cash, checks, drafts, promissory notes, and allocation orders. According to this statement, the financial situation described in the first section is not very contradictory, because what is required to be tightened refers to all currencies, and what is required to be increased is one of the currencies - cash. With this explanation, it may be possible to find a two-pronged countermeasure: that is, tighten other currencies and increase cash issuance.</p>
<p>With the skyrocketing prices, people already feel overwhelmed, and encountering a lack of cash and being exploited by discounts is really breathless. Therefore, we hope that the authorities will absolutely prohibit discounting in order to reduce a part of the malicious cash hoarding and most of the well-intentioned hoarding (malicious hoarding refers to seeking profits through discounting, and well-intentioned hoarding is to avoid suffering losses from discounting). At the same time, please issue a large amount of new banknotes. In order to facilitate even the immediate issuance of 10,000 yuan banknotes, the Executive Yuan has already approved it.</p>
<p>The issuance of cash is to increase the amount of currency, and tightening the currency is relative. Therefore, it is necessary to find ways to remedy other currencies. This remedy can be said to be simple, that is, please tighten the lending of the Central Bank. This method has been implemented several times and has been very effective. However, the tightening is loosened again, so that the effect is seen and then disappears.</p>
<p>Among the above-mentioned instruments, there is a newly discovered and very popular allocation order, and its position is quite questionable. The so-called allocation order is a bill for the Yin Qian industry to allocate funds to the Central Bank or the public association, which is specially used to adjust the difference between the same industry. However, now various banks and money houses actually use it instead of cash as a customer's payment, which is beyond its essence, not only violating the bill law (the bill law has no name for allocation order), but also encroaching on the status of the legal currency, so it is hoped that it will be corrected and stopped, and its circulation in the hands of outsiders will be banned. In terms of the frequent occurrence of allocation order disputes recently, it can be seen that its malpractices are numerous. It is impossible to immediately prohibit it.</p>
<h3>Ways to Eliminate Discounting</h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>Reading the newspaper, the city's economic police recently dispatched all of them, and have successively arrested dozens of criminals who illegally discounted, all of whom have been detained pending strict handling. In addition, the Financial Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Bank, in order to stabilize the financial situation, has found the true evidence of illegal discounting in a certain financial institution, and immediately presented it to the ministry for strict handling. The general public must be very happy to hear this news, and the practice of discounting may be slightly reduced in the future, but the phenomenon of cash shortage may be difficult to eliminate for a while. How to solve the current crisis, I think the authorities already have considerable specific methods and a continuous determination to severely crack down on discounting. As a member of the public, the reader is sincerely looking forward to the Bureau to take emergency arrangements for cracking down on discounting, in order to achieve further results. Here are a few points to provide to the authorities for reference:</p>
<p>Thoroughly investigate the cash deposits of each bank and village and the actual number of daily payments: if any private hoarding of cash and illegal discounting are found, they should be severely punished according to law to warn others.</p>
<p>Adjust the amount of cash received by each bank and village: the Central Bank should plan in a holistic manner according to the actual needs of each bank and village and the market conditions. The cash supply to each bank and village should be as lenient as possible to make reasonable adjustments, so that the cash guide code of each bank and village is sufficient to pay the minimum amount of deposits and withdrawals of depositors.</p>
<p>Specify the minimum limit for depositors to withdraw cash from each bank and village: At present, the limit for depositors to withdraw cash from each bank and village is generally 5,000 yuan per day, that is, at most 30,000 yuan per week, which is too low. In my opinion, the minimum amount per household must be widened to more than 100,000 yuan per week, and 30,000 to 50,000 yuan can be withdrawn each time. In this way, there can be a reasonable supply for the cash needs of small depositors, and financial institutions have clearly defined limits, and there will no longer be arbitrary restrictions on withdrawals and the abuse of allocation orders.</p>
<p>Strictly restrict the development of allocation orders: The issuance of allocation orders was originally intended to facilitate the payment of huge amounts of funds between banks and villages, but generally financial institutions have changed to paying allocation orders for depositors' withdrawals due to the lack of cash. This is actually a temporary measure, but unexpectedly, some financial operators took the opportunity to fish in troubled waters, deliberately concealing cash, and operating discounting transactions with high interest rates above 20%. On the one hand, they restricted deposits and withdrawals and abused allocation orders, which led to the current situation. For the present plan, the authorities should re-investigate the content and business conditions of each bank and village, and strictly define the qualifications for issuing allocation orders. Those who are suspected of disturbing the financial situation should have their qualifications for issuing allocation orders cancelled. Secondly, the amount of allocation orders issued should also be restricted. Each bank and village issues at most a certain amount of money per day, and the face value of each allocation order should also be restricted accordingly, stipulating that only allocation orders above 10,000 yuan or 50,000 yuan are allowed to be issued. Such small-amount allocation orders can be reduced, so that there will no longer be 3,000 to 5,000 yuan allocation orders circulating in the market. For payments below 10,000 yuan, each bank and village will have to pay in cash, which is also an effective measure to eliminate discounting.</p>
<p>The above is just my personal opinion. As for how to implement the emergency arrangements specifically, I sincerely hope that the wise authorities will implement them effectively with the means of cutting the Gordian knot, so that the entire financial institution can be restored to stability, and the lives of ordinary people can be spared from further threats. I can't help but look forward to it.</p>

<h3>China Child Welfare Association Appeals to All Sectors for Donations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai China Child Welfare Association, in order to promote the work of rescuing refugee children, will launch this year's expanded fundraising campaign starting today. The target is set at 50 million yuan, for a period of one month, from the 25th of this month to the 24th of July. During the fundraising period, in addition to the association (1231 Daxing Road) directly receiving donations, Jin Cheng Bank and Xinhua also receive donations. The association currently maintains two places, the Shanghai Child Welfare Training Institute and the Upstream Refugee Child Training Institute, with a total of more than 300 orphans. At a time when prices are soaring and expenses are extremely difficult, it is really difficult to continue. I sincerely hope that people from all walks of life will generously donate, so that the association's training work can continue to advance, then benefiting children is really not insignificant.</p>
<h3>Hope to Find a Way to Dispose of Garbage Accumulation</h3>
<p>Recently, many garbage trucks have been carrying garbage from all over the place and accumulating it on Shandong Road Ningbo Road. During this summer, listening to the sun and rain, the odor is overflowing, and mosquitoes and flies are breeding, which is harmful to the health of citizens. I hope that the municipal health authorities will find a way to dispose of it as soon as possible, then the citizens will be very fortunate. (Huang Jiaxu)</p>
