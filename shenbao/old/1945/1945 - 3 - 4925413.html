<h3>陳院長元旦廣播　一秉旣定方針奮勵邁進　不惜犧牲爭取獨立解放</h3>
<p>南京二十日中央社電　元旦晚九時，國府行政院陳院長舉行交歡廣播，其詞如下：</p>
<p>今天是民國三十四年的元旦，回溯大東亞戰爭爆發於民國三十年底，到現在已經跨入第四個年頭了，照目前戰事進行的程序看來，今年將是大東亞戰爭的決勝年，也就是決定整個大東亞民族前途命運的一年。</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭爆發之初，我們即以同甘共苦之決心，協力戰爭，前年一月九日，更進而以同生共死之決心，自動的宣吿參戰。因爲中國受英美帝國主義的壓迫侵害，自鴉片戰爭以來，已歷百年，打倒英美帝國主義的侵略，使中國擺脫次殖民地的地位，本來是中國國民的素志，我們早已認定，英美帝國主義是中國唯一的敵人，同時也就是全東亞民族唯一的敵人。欲求中國之獨立自由，必須打倒英美帝國主義，欲求全東亞的獨立自由，也必須打倒英美帝國主義。中國之命運與東亞的命運爲不可分，其理由即在於此。</p>
<p>現在是後階段決勝的序幕已經展開，敵英美正出其全力以從事於兩洋作戰，敵英美一面在歐洲大陸作戰，蒙受莫大的犧牲，最近德國的反攻，業已使其陣綫零亂，措手不及。一面在太平洋勞師襲遠，盲目嘗試，其將遭遇嚴重的打擊，目必無可倖免，而在中國大陸，連戰皆北之情形日形狼狽，及其假藉中國供其犧牲之陰謀日益窮蹙，尤屬無可掩飾。我們深信爲正義爲生存而戰的大東亞戰爭，必然獲得最後的勝利，毫無疑義。</p>
<p>數月之間，敵美海軍在太平洋損失浩大，正所謂暴虎馮河，其冒險深入，甚或氣援於敵英艦隊以作最後之掙扎，自屬意料中的事。但戰局無論如何推移，我們惟有以一　的決心，最大的努力，以求取戰爭的完遂。本人最近訪問盟邦日本，親見日本朝野決心堅定，精神昻揚，生產銳進，軍需充實，而勞動的勤勉，投軍的踴躍，無一不令人欽佩興奮。我們深信其他如各友邦，亦必能加强協力決戰的態勢，以大東亞十尤尤人誓共生死的決心，必能對於敵人再侵略東亞之勢力一一加以粉碎，還我東亞，復我光榮。</p>
<p>中國現正努力國民政府自身之强化，俾能分担戰爭義務，負荷解決時局的責任。去年元旦在主席曾經以「肅正思想」，「增加生產」，「確立治安」三大方針昭示我們，此皆參戰的中國爲興華爲保亞應盡的努力，我們今日更無他言，惟有一本旣定方針，奮勵邁進。我們更認定，現代的戰爭前方後方其地之重要同，其責任之艱鉅亦同，參戰的中國，自責不可不嚴，自勵允不可不勇，大後方的工作，固屬責無旁貸，即令戰局擴展，惟　期中國之自由平等可以獲致，東亞之獨立解放可以完成，任何犧牲亦在所不惜，謹以滿腔熱誠，祝賀大東亞各國國運昌隆，祝賀大東亞戰爭在今年獲得最後勝利。</p>
<h3>與各國緊密提携　強化決戰態勢　張總理昨晚廣播演說</h3>
<p>滿洲二日中央社電　二日下午七時二十分，大東亞各國首腦交歡廣播，滿洲張國務總理大臣廣播詞如次：今大東亞戰爭步入第四年，本年實爲吾等大東亞民族開戰以來之重大關頭，擊減人類公敵英美，建設大東亞自非易事，今後尙多困難，目前之決戰，以菲律實爲中心，頓趨熾烈，且大決戰行將決定吾等大東亞民族之命運，此決戰之歸趨，對大東亞前途之決定，有重大影響。余確信此精強無比之日軍之勇戰力鬥，更加集結大東亞各國之總力，定能突破難局，使敵不得再起。今者，企圖蹂蹦東亞巳深迫，我國對此驕敵之野心，巳觸發吾人之怒憤，而日軍全體之壯烈特攻精神，乃爲我全東亞精神之表現，吾等大東亞民族，若以日軍之精神爲精神，一致以總拚撞之堅强，決意各盡其力，則過去英美暴虐數百年之東亞，反成其滅亡之地。我滿洲自開戰以來，舉全國總力，一意向完遂戰爭，增强戰力邁進，吾等對此竊喜而引爲榮耀，際此決戰第四年開始，我滿洲益將與大東亞各國緊密提携，強化決戰態勢，吾人此對固決意，誓願表現於光明之前進。</p>
<p>巴莫代表新年演詞</p>
<p>仰光二日順央社電　緬甸國家代表巴莫氏，頃發表新年演詞，闡明緬甸國民之決意如下：大東亞十億民族之命運及幸福，均懸於今後戰局之歸趨，吾人應犧牲一切，展開有利於我方這戰爭局勢，而以百折不撓之精神，獲取大東亞永久之解放，吾人爲完遂勝利，決繼續作必死之鬥爭，旦須模仿日本之愛國精神及特攻隊之精神。</p>
<p>史加爾諾闡明決意</p>
<p>瓜加爾達二日中央社電　爪哇中央參議院議長，爪哇奉公會中央本部史加爾諾氏，一日晨特於此間廣播電台廣播，大意，與日本及大東亞各民族提携，向獲得大東亞戰爭最後勝利之途邁進，與大東亞民族共同敵人英美決一死戰。大東亞戰爭之目的，於日本政府舉行第八十五屆議會時，業巳闡明，同時日本對於緬甸，菲律賓之獨立，與允許印度納西亞民族將來之獨立，亦確切表明。最近吾等於中央參議會席上已決議，爲實現大東亞共同宣言之理念，誓死奮鬥之宣言，其意義即在響應大東亞宣言，披瀝大東亞十億民族爲謀解放而奮起之決意。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>再論怎樣實踐政治競賽</h3>
<p>元旦日我們提出了「政治競賽」的口號，昨天且巳說明了如何實踐競賽。概括的說，我們要以虛心靜氣的態度，與盟邦作學習性的競賽；堅毅果決的氣魄，與渝共作鬥爭性的競賽；相助協力的精神，與自己人作互勵性的競賽。</p>
<p>上述三項競賽，與盟邦學習性的競賽，可說是競賽的參考；與渝共鬥爭性的競賽，可說是競賽的目的；而自己人相互之間的競賽，可說是競賽的手段。即是：我們應採取盟邦的政治優點作爲工作的一部份榜樣，以追過渝共，與渝共爭取政治力量，爭取人民爲目的，大家競做好事情。所以，基本上我們內部自己要首先互助互勵地競賽起來。唯有我們內部自己先競相做好，纔得設法逍過別人。</p>
<p>在競賽當中，我們應把去年所提出的斷然强化政治，革新政治的四個原則—即「强力政治」，「專家政治」，「親民政治」，「廉潔政治」作爲競賽的手段，而以元旦日所指出的今年應做的事情—即「求政治之澈底淸明」，「求治安之眞正確立」，「求生產之切實增加」，「求民生之適當安定」，作爲競賽的目標。</p>
<p>那末，我們怎樣進行競賽呢？</p>
<p>第一，我們要以具體的工作來從事競賽。僅是紙面上的空洞煊染或口頭上的虛偽宣傳，而沒有實在內容，是要不得的。我們要競賽實際，不是競賽表面。報帳主義式的競賽，不但無補於眞實工作，而且反而會耗蝕人力物力。</p>
<p>第二，我們要有切實的計劃來發動競賽。今年上自中央下至各層地方政府，以及各級機關，必須定下整個的及各個的能够相互配合的政治工作計劃，以作競賽的依據。計劃又須切實可行，決定計劃之際，要考慮究竟能做到如何程度，決定之後，一定要求其做得通，做得好。太理想太龐大而事實做不到的計劃，還是少定的好。</p>
<p>第三，我們要下一個公平的標準來甄別競賽的成績。紙面上口頭上的空洞東西，單純會議，宣言，傳單，標語，以及官樣文章的報銷等等，萬不能作爲工作成績的標準。必須從實際上去看具體的工作表現—政事究竟改革了多少？當政者究竟如何廉潔？治安究竟進步得怎樣？生產究竟有沒有增大？民生究竟改善到什麽程度？這些，都應參照工作計劃，加以公平的評定。</p>
<p>第四，政府當局要訂立一種賞罰制度。工作成績做得好，固然是所應該，但如何能對工作努力者才以獎勵，必能鼓勵他們做出更高成績。而對工作不力，競賽落後的地方，機關，或個人，則必須予以嚴正的處分懲辦，對妨碍競賽者，尤應毫不留情，澈底檢舉。</p>
<p>第五，政府當局要多多聽取民衆的意見，以作競賽成績的重要參考。政治工作的成績好不好，民衆是最敏感的，凡是爲民衆歌頌或擁護的政府與官吏，終是好的；反之，就是壞的。看誰最能够得到民衆的擁戴，誰就是做得最好。所以中央政府及地方政府必須給與民衆以表達意見的機會，莫如設立全國性的民意機關。讓民衆來作競賽的評判人。</p>
<p>我們如果能眞正根據上述幾點，來進行競賽，相信成績一定會很好的。不過一切尙有待於政府當局的切實領導，及各級官員的充分努力。願大家重視這側競賽。</p>

<p>瑞典京城二日中央社電　德國社訊，據合衆社消息：盧布林之親蘇波人，昨於成立臨時政府之前，曾舉行辯論會，柏魯特「總統」於該會中指控倫敦之流亡波政府有反動及法西斯之彩色，對流亡波政府前總理米哥拉席克亦加以抨擊，竟謂不歡迎渠返國。聞有農民一千三百名曾具呈要求取消米氏曁其他駐倫敦之波蘭二大政黨領袖之國籍。按盧布林政府爲波蘭全國代表大會之議員一百五十名所選出者，其中包括德軍佔領區之代表，該政府共有閣員十七人，均已向柏氏宣誓就職。又訊，倫敦之流亡波政府「總理」阿克斯才夫斯基於週一晚宣稱，渠之政府爲唯一之合法波政府，其目的在求獨立自由，而使內政不受他國之干涉。</p>

<h3>希姆萊發文告　勗勉國防軍</h3>
<p>柏林二日中央社電　德國社訊：德後備軍總司令希姆萊，頃向該軍發表新年命令云，後備軍不斷增援，對前綫德軍之成就貢獻頗多，國防軍將於一九四五年盡更大努力，以完成元首之意旨，吾人將於新年中對勝利及和平獲決定性之進展，吾人將有超過應盡義務之成就。希氏繼以內長之資格，勗勉德人努力工作。</p>

<h3>展望戰局的階段（三）　上海日本陸海外報道部長座談</h3>
<p>松島：是呀，全是汽油問題。</p>
<p>松平：那末，重慶想必是相當焦慮的吧。關於這一點，沒有什麽說的嗎？</p>
<p>出淵：重慶現在受到美國的壓迫和日本的打擊以外，還受到延安共黨的威脅，非常爲難。不過，困難雖然困難，口頭上仍舊很硬。最近，重慶宣傳部長王世杰在接見記者團時，仍說重慶確信必得最後的勝利。他說，重慶政府當局承認中國的現狀極爲重大，可是關於最後的結果，却具確信。</p>
<p>松島：打敗仗嗎？（大笑）</p>
<p>出淵：所以有這種確信的綠故，即因反軸心國現在對於中國戰區在世界戰中的重要性已有深刻的認識，尤其因爲美國對於中國大陸戰局的推移表示非常關心。因爲美國表示非常關心中國大陸戰局的進展，所以有確信。他知此說。</p>
<p>松平：想靠別人的拳頭來打架哪。</p>
<p>出淵：仍舊是想耀續依賴別人力量的戰爭罷了。</p>
<p>松平：文飾桂林，柳州失陷的口實，也說是因爲美國的補給不够。如此說來，旣然不能立刻要到許多物資，結果重慶是不會打勝的啦。</p>
<p>英美艦隊最近動向</p>
<p>松平：美國的艦隊最近好像不很出動的樣子。</p>
<p>松島：大概沒有了吧。（哄笑）戰艦大的十艘以下；航空母　則如剛才說過一樣，的十艘左右，而且一半是補助航空母艦；巡洋艦簡直沒有啦，不過，能動的驅逐艦還有百數十艘，潛水艇也有七八十艘，這些都是槪數。</p>
<p>松平：英國更少了。</p>
<p>松島：當然還要少一點。祇要看英國議會等的演說就可以知道。海軍力是有用的東西，我想英國在印度洋未必會認眞拼命的。英國把太平洋交給美國，由此消耗美國的海軍兵力，而自己則暗暗打算戰後的事情。</p>
<p>出淵：想確保戰後的發言權哪。這在英國當然是如此的。</p>
<p>松島：華府會議以來，英國海軍最不開心了，因爲他們被美國壓倒啦。</p>
<p>松平：近頃，英團新聞記者宜稱羅斯福抱着想做世界大總統的野心，說他妄想美國擁有比世界各國所有艦隊全部更有力的艦隊，擁有世界最多數的商船，並且統制世界的民用航空。這眞是做了美國總統還不够，更進一步想做世界大總統的人所有的野心了。據測或將有人起來防止此事哩。</p>
<p>出淵：大家想有戰後的發言權。歐戰中的英美蘇關係，正是這個樣子。</p>
<p>松平：是呀。渝蔣也有這樣念頭，所以不願拿出自已的軍隊來</p>
<p>出淵：要之，反軸心各國都是如此的……</p>
<p>松平：目我本位的政策呀。</p>
<p>松島：美國的艦國，在其迄今最稱得意的航空母艦主義上受到重大打擊以後，僅餘相當於人的頭顱的戰艦，以及兩腿的驅逐艦，而最要緊的軀幹却沒有了。因此，今後美國可說不能够再作價正有組織的海戰了。昨日，美國演播盛稱將有新兵器出現，據說羅斯福今後關於戰局的進展希望有優越的科學家出現。要之，新兵器固然是必要的，但是旣有這樣的說話，則迄今以爲物量萬能的美國的作戰，其行不通的情形不是非常明顯了嗎？</p>

<h3>米統會將改善　米糧收買工作　陳主委述本年工作重點</h3>
<p>米糧制委員會，於昨（二）日上午十時，在該會辦公廳內舉行新年團拜儀式，陳主任委員植田副主任委員，分別向全體職員作精神訓話，語多勉勵，聽者感奮。中央社記者就本年度工作方針問題，叩詢陳主任委員，承發表談話如次：過去本會，對於工作情况，槪不輕易向外間發表，尤以關於數字等，有關行政秘密，致外間對本會工作有所懷疑，惟善意之立塲，本人必竭誠接受各界之批評。自本年度起，本會對於收買米糧工作，有重要之革新，査過去米糧統制工作之最大障碍，確以收買過程中走漏太多所致。本會有鑒於此，自本年度起，承友邦當局予以協助，與國內各保安隊及各級官　之後援，決心加强維護農民之利益，務使從收買到配給之階段中，無粒米走漏。同時友邦方面人士，爲協力本會工作，自動組織收買米糧挺身隊，其熱誠殊爲可佩。又過去本會與農民交換米糧之代價，除一部份爲現金外，並憑證配給棉布，肥皂，火柴，砂糖，洋燭等，本年起本會實施直接交換制度，當塲將上述物資直接交與農民，務使絲毫不受中間人之剝削，同時再增配荳餅，硫破等肥料，俾增加生產。至本市一般人民，因不明瞭本會工作之苦心，有時因黑市米來源缺少，及價格高漲關係，引起恐慌，資產階級仰求黑市，購囤大批米糧，使黑市價格愈抬愈高，結果不但威脅民生，抑且間接阻碍本會收買工作，倘全市人民一致協力本會，則收買工作自可順利，換言之，配給之數量當可加增，則黑市米自可趨於消滅，民生即可安定。總之，本人願與全體同人，鑒於以往之經騐，下十二萬分之決心與努力，向改善之途邁進，並盼各界予以援助。</p>
<h3>車站碼頭　嚴禁留難旅客　警局維護交通秩序</h3>

<h3>粉麥會改組後　收買小麥成績</h3>
<p>商統會粉麥統制委員會自去年七月改組成立，對於麥類收買機構予以調整後，收買工作頗爲順利，惟因物價變動甚速，故未能達到預想之目的，其第一期及第二期收買成績一，（包括小麥元麥大麥在內）計南京區二六一·二七五包，丹陽區二六·五六三包，無錫區二三九·六二七包·鎭江區一六〇·六二七包，常州區一九〇·〇二七包，蘇州區一一〇·四三九包，蚌埠區一四三·八二二包，江北區五九〇·三三〇包，統計收買數量達一·九三七·一五六包，第三期收買工作，於去年十二月繼續在各該區進行，迄今一月間，計達一百萬包左右，至於收買小麥委託各粉廠製成麵粉，配給上海，南京，無錫，常州，鎮江，蘇州，揚州，蕪湖，埠蚌等區，達一六三·五七〇袋（此項配給數至十月底）。</p>

<h3>絲業專家　張嫻女士逝世</h3>
<p>張嫻女士爲吾　絲集界儀出專家，自滸野關蠶業專門學校畢集後，曾兩度赴日本高等蠶絲學校，研究蠶業多年，並赴日本各地攷察。回國後會任江蘇實業廳技正及無錫永盛絲廠與隆昌絲廠廠長等職。該兩廠出品之生絲，標準極高，暢銷海外，張女士努力於民族工業之熱忱毅力，二十餘年如一日。戰事發生後，在上海集股創辦上海製絲所，兼任經理，出品之優良，不亞於昔日，因原料等受限制，該廠不得已而停業。張嫻女士復集股在蘇州創辦國華絲織廠，兼任經理，所出絲襪較舶來品尤爲經用美觀。此後張女士正籌劃織綢織緞，發揚民族工業，孰料壯志未酬，因患癌症，痛於一月二日巳時歿於大華醫院，聞擇於一月四日下午二時在中國殯儀館大殮，張女士之逝世豈特女界之損失，絲業界之損失，抑亦整個民族工業之不幸，聞者莫不惋惜。</p>

<h3>President Chen's New Year's Day Broadcast: Advancing Vigorously Following Established Policy; Unafraid to Sacrifice to Achieve Independence and Liberation</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency) – At 9 PM on New Year's Day, President Chen of the Executive Yuan of the National Government gave a congratulatory broadcast, saying the following:</p>
<p>Today is New Year's Day of the 34th year of the Republic of China. Recalling that the Greater East Asia War broke out at the end of the 30th year of the Republic of China, it has now entered its fourth year. Judging from the current progress of the war, this year will be the decisive year of the Greater East Asia War, which will determine the future destiny of the entire Greater East Asian people.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, we cooperated in the war with the determination to share both joys and sorrows. On January 9th of the year before last, we further declared our participation in the war with the determination to live and die together. Because China has suffered from the oppression and infringement of Anglo-American imperialism since the Opium War for a century, it has always been the aspiration of the Chinese people to overthrow the aggression of Anglo-American imperialism and free China from its semi-colonial status. We have long recognized that Anglo-American imperialism is China's only enemy, and also the only enemy of all East Asian peoples. To seek China's independence and freedom, we must overthrow Anglo-American imperialism; to seek the independence and freedom of all East Asia, we must also overthrow Anglo-American imperialism. The fate of China and the fate of East Asia are inseparable, and that is the reason.</p>
<p>Now the prelude to the decisive phase has begun. The enemy, the Anglo-Americans, are using all their strength to engage in warfare in both oceans. On the one hand, the enemy, the Anglo-Americans, are fighting on the European continent and suffering tremendous sacrifices. Recently, the German counter-offensive has already disrupted their lines and caught them off guard. On the other hand, they are blindly trying to attack from afar in the Pacific, and they will inevitably encounter serious blows, which cannot be avoided. On the Chinese mainland, the situation of repeated defeats is becoming increasingly embarrassing, and their conspiracy to use China as a sacrifice is becoming increasingly impoverished, which is especially undeniable. We firmly believe that the Greater East Asia War, fought for justice and survival, will surely achieve final victory without any doubt.</p>
<p>In the past few months, the enemy, the US Navy, has suffered heavy losses in the Pacific. As the saying goes, "a reckless man braves a river barehanded." Their adventurous deep penetration, and even their gas support for the enemy British fleet in a final struggle, is to be expected. But no matter how the war situation changes, we can only strive for the completion of the war with a steadfast determination and our greatest efforts. I recently visited our ally Japan and personally witnessed the firm determination and high spirits of the Japanese government and people, the sharp increase in production, and the abundance of military supplies. The diligence in labor and the enthusiasm for joining the military are all admirable and inspiring. We firmly believe that other friendly nations will also be able to strengthen their posture of resolute cooperation, and with the determination of the Greater East Asian nations to share life and death, they will surely crush all forces that re-invade East Asia and restore our East Asia and our glory.</p>
<p>China is now working hard to strengthen itself and the National Government so that it can share war obligations and shoulder the responsibility of resolving the current situation. On New Year's Day last year, the chairman proclaimed the three major policies of "purifying thought," "increasing production," and "establishing security," all of which are the efforts that a participating China should make to revitalize China and protect Asia. We have nothing else to say today, except to advance vigorously following the established policy. We further recognize that the importance of the front and rear areas in modern warfare is the same, and the difficulty of their responsibilities is also the same. Participating China must be strict with itself and be brave in self-encouragement. The work in the rear is an unshirkable responsibility, and even if the war expands, only if China's freedom and equality can be achieved and East Asia's independence and liberation can be completed, any sacrifice will not be spared. I sincerely wish the Greater East Asian nations prosperity and that the Greater East Asia War will achieve final victory this year.</p>
<h3>Close Cooperation with Various Countries; Strengthening the Resolute Battle Posture; Prime Minister Zhang Gave a Broadcast Speech Last Night</h3>
<p>Manchukuo, 2nd (Central News Agency) – At 7:20 PM on the 2nd, leaders of various Greater East Asian nations gave congratulatory broadcasts. Prime Minister Zhang of Manchukuo gave the following broadcast speech: Now that the Greater East Asia War has entered its fourth year, this year is a major turning point for us, the people of Greater East Asia, since the start of the war. It is no easy task to defeat the common enemy of mankind, the Anglo-Americans, and build Greater East Asia. There will still be many difficulties in the future. The current decisive battle, centered on the Philippines, is becoming increasingly fierce, and the Great Decisive Battle will determine the fate of us, the people of Greater East Asia. The outcome of this decisive battle will have a significant impact on the future of Greater East Asia. I firmly believe that the brave fighting power of the incomparably strong Japanese army, coupled with the combined power of the Greater East Asian nations, will surely overcome the difficulties and prevent the enemy from rising again. Now, the attempt to trample on East Asia has become deeply pressing. Our country's anger has been ignited by the ambition of this arrogant enemy, and the magnificent special attack spirit of the entire Japanese army is a manifestation of the spirit of our entire East Asia. If we, the people of Greater East Asia, take the spirit of the Japanese army as our spirit and work together with a strong determination to do our best, then East Asia, which has suffered from the brutal tyranny of the Anglo-Americans for hundreds of years, will become their place of destruction. Since the start of the war, my Manchukuo has used all its national strength to move forward with the single-minded purpose of completing the war and enhancing our combat power. We are pleased and proud of this. As we begin this fourth year of the decisive battle, my Manchukuo will more closely cooperate with the Greater East Asian nations to strengthen our decisive battle posture. We will express this determination in our bright progress.</p>
<p>Bamao's New Year Address</p>
<p>Yangon, 2nd (Shunyang News Agency) – Mr. Bamao, the representative of Myanmar, recently gave a New Year address, clarifying the determination of the Burmese people as follows: The fate and happiness of the 1 billion people of Greater East Asia depend on the future trend of the war. We should sacrifice everything to develop a war situation that is favorable to our side, and with an indomitable spirit, achieve the permanent liberation of Greater East Asia. In order to complete the victory, we must continue our death struggle and imitate the patriotic spirit and the spirit of the special attack teams of Japan.</p>
<p>Skarno Clarifies Determination</p>
<p>Guajarda, 2nd (Central News Agency) – Mr. Skarno, Chairman of the Central Council of Java and Head of the Central Headquarters of the Java Dedication Association, broadcast from this radio station on the morning of the 1st, with the main point being that he would cooperate with Japan and the people of Greater East Asia to advance towards achieving the final victory in the Greater East Asia War and fight to the death against the common enemies of the people of Greater East Asia, the Anglo-Americans. The purpose of the Greater East Asia War was clarified when the Japanese government held its 85th session of parliament. At the same time, Japan's independence for Burma and the Philippines, and its promise to allow the independence of the Indonesian people in the future, were also clearly stated. Recently, we at the Central Council have resolved to make a declaration to fight to the death to realize the ideals of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. Its significance lies in responding to the Greater East Asia Declaration and expressing the determination of the 1 billion people of Greater East Asia to rise up for liberation.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Re-discussing How to Practice Political Competition</h3>
<p>On New Year's Day, we put forward the slogan of "Political Competition," and yesterday we explained how to practice competition. In general, we should adopt a humble and calm attitude to engage in learning competition with allied countries; a firm and decisive spirit to engage in combative competition with the Communist Party; and a supportive and cooperative spirit to engage in mutually encouraging competition with our own people.</p>
<p>The above three types of competition, the learning competition with allied countries, can be said to be the reference for competition; the combative competition with the Communist Party can be said to be the purpose of competition; and the competition between ourselves can be said to be the means of competition. That is to say, we should adopt the political advantages of allied countries as examples for our work, in order to surpass the Communist Party and compete with the Communist Party for political power and for the people. Therefore, basically, we must first compete with each other internally in a mutually supportive and encouraging way. Only when we first compete with each other internally can we find a way to surpass others.</p>
<p>In the competition, we should take the four principles of resolutely strengthening politics and reforming politics put forward last year—namely "Strong Politics," "Expert Politics," "Pro-People Politics," and "Clean Politics"—as the means of competition, and take the things that should be done this year as pointed out on New Year's Day—namely "seeking thorough clarity in politics," "seeking true establishment of security," "seeking practical increase in production," and "seeking appropriate stability in people's livelihood"—as the goals of the competition.</p>
<p>So, how do we conduct the competition?</p>
<p>First, we must engage in competition with concrete work. It is unacceptable to have only empty rhetoric on paper or false propaganda in words without real content. We want to compete in reality, not on the surface. Accounting-style competition not only does not help real work, but also consumes manpower and material resources.</p>
<p>Second, we must have a practical plan to launch the competition. This year, from the central government to local governments at all levels, and all levels of agencies, must set down a whole set of political work plans and individual political work plans that can be coordinated with each other, as the basis for competition. The plan must also be practical and feasible. When deciding on the plan, we must consider how far we can actually achieve it, and after deciding, we must ensure that it is done smoothly and well. It is better to set fewer plans that are too ideal or too large to be achieved in reality.</p>
<p>Third, we must set a fair standard to distinguish the achievements of the competition. Empty things on paper and in words, simple meetings, declarations, leaflets, slogans, and official-style reports, etc., must not be used as standards for work achievements. We must look at the concrete work performance from a practical perspective—how much has political affairs been reformed? How clean are those in power? How has security improved? Has production increased? To what extent has people's livelihood improved? These should all be fairly evaluated with reference to the work plan.</p>
<p>Fourth, the government authorities should establish a reward and punishment system. It is, of course, what should be done to achieve good work results, but how to reward those who work hard will encourage them to achieve even greater results. And for places, agencies, or individuals that are not working hard and lagging behind in the competition, they must be given serious sanctions and punishments, and those who hinder the competition should be thoroughly reported without any mercy.</p>
<p>Fifth, the government authorities should listen more to the opinions of the public as an important reference for the achievements of the competition. The public is most sensitive to whether the achievements of political work are good or not. Those governments and officials who are praised or supported by the public are always good; on the contrary, they are bad. Whoever is most able to gain the support of the people is the one who does the best. Therefore, the central government and local governments must give the public the opportunity to express their opinions, such as establishing national public opinion organs. Let the public be the judges of the competition.</p>
<p>If we can truly conduct the competition based on the above points, I believe the results will be very good. However, everything still depends on the practical leadership of the government authorities and the full efforts of officials at all levels. I hope everyone will pay attention to this competition.</p>

<h3>Prospects for the War Situation (3): Roundtable Discussion with the Heads of the Shanghai Japanese Army and Navy Press Departments</h3>
<p>Matsushima: Yes, it's all about the gasoline problem.</p>
<p>Matsudaira: Then, Chongqing must be quite anxious. Is there anything to say about that?</p>
<p>Ide: Chongqing is now under pressure from the United States and attacked by Japan. Besides, it is also threatened by the Yan'an Communists, which is very difficult. However, although the difficulties are difficult, they are still very tough in words. Recently, when Chongqing Propaganda Minister Wang Shijie met with reporters, he still said that Chongqing was confident of winning the final victory. He said that the Chongqing government authorities admitted that the current situation in China was extremely serious, but they were confident of the final result.</p>
<p>Matsushima: Losing the battle? (Laughing)</p>
<p>Ide: The reason for this certainty is that the anti-Axis countries now have a deep understanding of the importance of the China war zone in the world war, especially because the United States has expressed great concern about the development of the war in mainland China. Because the United States has expressed great concern about the progress of the war in mainland China, so there is certainty. He knows this saying.</p>
<p>Matsudaira: They want to fight with other people's fists.</p>
<p>Ide: Still want to continue to rely on the power of others to fight the war.</p>
<p>Matsudaira: To embellish the fall of Guilin and Liuzhou, they also said that it was because the US supply was insufficient. In this way, since many materials cannot be obtained immediately, Chongqing will not win.</p>
<p>Recent Trends in the British and American Fleets</p>
<p>Matsudaira: It seems that the US fleet has not been dispatched very much recently.</p>
<p>Matsushima: Probably not. (Laughter) There are less than ten large battleships; as for aircraft carriers, as just mentioned, there are about ten, and half of them are auxiliary aircraft carriers; there are almost no cruisers, but there are still hundreds of operational destroyers, and there are also seventy or eighty submarines. These are all approximate numbers.</p>
<p>Matsudaira: Britain has even fewer.</p>
<p>Matsushima: Of course, it will be a little less. You can know by just looking at the speeches of the British Parliament. Naval power is useful, and I don't think Britain will work hard in the Indian Ocean. Britain handed the Pacific over to the United States, thereby consuming the US naval forces, while secretly planning for post-war events.</p>
<p>Ide: They want to ensure the right to speak after the war. This is of course the case in Britain.</p>
<p>Matsushima: Since the Washington Conference, the British Navy has been most unhappy because they were overwhelmed by the United States.</p>
<p>Matsudaira: Recently, British news reporters declared that Roosevelt harbored the ambition of becoming the president of the world, saying that he fantasized that the United States would have a fleet more powerful than all the fleets of all countries in the world, the largest number of merchant ships in the world, and control the world's civil aviation. This is really not enough to be the president of the United States, and he even has the ambition of becoming the president of the world. It is estimated that someone will rise up to prevent this.</p>
<p>Ide: Everyone wants to have the right to speak after the war. The relationship between Britain, the United States and the Soviet Union in the European War is exactly like this.</p>
<p>Matsudaira: Yes. Yu Jiang also has this idea, so he is unwilling to take out his own army.</p>
<p>Ide: In short, all anti-Axis countries are like this...</p>
<p>Matsudaira: Self-centered policy.</p>
<p>Matsushima: After the American fleet suffered a major blow to its most proud aircraft carrier doctrine, only a battleship equivalent to a human head and destroyers with two legs were left, but the most important torso was gone. Therefore, the United States can no longer be said to be able to carry out a regular organized naval battle in the future. Yesterday, the United States broadcasted that new weapons would appear. It is said that Roosevelt hopes that excellent scientists will appear in the future regarding the development of the war. In short, new weapons are certainly necessary, but since there are such words, isn't it very obvious that the American strategy, which has always believed that material quantity is omnipotent, will not work?</p>

<h3>US Rice Administration Will Improve Rice Purchasing Work: Committee Chairman Chen States Key Points of This Year's Work</h3>
<p>The Rice Grain Control Committee held a New Year group worship ceremony at its office at 10 am yesterday (2nd). Committee Chairman Chen and Deputy Committee Chairman Ueda respectively gave spiritual instructions to all staff, with many encouragements, which moved the listeners. A Central News Agency reporter asked Committee Chairman Chen about the work guidelines for this year, and he kindly made the following remarks: In the past, this committee has never easily released information about its work to the outside world, especially about numbers and other administrative secrets, which caused suspicion about the committee's work. However, with a benevolent standpoint, I will sincerely accept criticisms from all walks of life. Starting this year, this committee will have major innovations in the work of purchasing rice. After investigation, the biggest obstacle to rice control work in the past was indeed caused by too much leakage during the purchasing process. In view of this, this committee, starting this year, will receive assistance from friendly countries and the support of domestic security teams and officials at all levels, and is determined to strengthen the protection of the interests of farmers, so as to ensure that no grain of rice is leaked from the stage of purchasing to allocation. At the same time, people from friendly countries have voluntarily organized rice purchasing commando teams to cooperate with the committee's work, which is admirable. In the past, the price this committee exchanged with farmers for rice, in addition to a portion in cash, was also allocated cotton cloth, soap, matches, sugar, candles, etc. with vouchers. Starting this year, the committee will implement a direct exchange system, delivering the above materials directly to farmers on the spot, so as to ensure that they are not exploited by intermediaries in the slightest. At the same time, soybean cakes, sulfur fertilizer and other fertilizers will be added to increase production. As for the general public in this city, because they do not understand the committee's painstaking efforts, sometimes they panic because of the shortage of rice in the black market and the high prices. The bourgeoisie seeks the black market and hoards large quantities of rice, which makes the black market prices higher and higher. As a result, it not only threatens people's livelihoods, but also indirectly hinders the committee's purchasing work. If all the people in the city cooperate with the committee, the purchasing work can be carried out smoothly. In other words, the quantity of allocation can be increased, and the black market rice can be eliminated, and people's livelihoods can be stabilized. In short, I am willing to work with all my colleagues, learning from past experience, and making a determination and effort of 120,000 points to move towards improvement, and hope that all walks of life will provide assistance.</p>
<h3>Stations and Wharves Strictly Prohibit Making Things Difficult for Passengers: Police Bureau Maintains Traffic Order</h3>
<p>The Municipal Police Bureau is very concerned about the traffic order at railway stations and ship wharves. It has long ordered the police sub-bureaus under its jurisdiction to assign more police officers to effectively maintain order. Recently, the bureau has been informed of acts of making things difficult for passengers and merchants at stations and wharves. Therefore, the Inspection Department has dispatched inspectors to secretly investigate and strictly supervise the attitude of the police officers in directing passenger traffic, and to be more kind and sincere, so as to protect the safety of passengers and merchants.</p>
<h3>After the Reorganization of the Flour and Wheat Committee, Results of Wheat Purchases</h3>
<p>Since the reorganization and establishment of the Flour and Wheat Control Committee of the Commercial Control Association last July, after adjusting the wheat purchasing mechanism, the purchasing work has been quite smooth. However, due to the rapid changes in commodity prices, the intended purpose could not be achieved. The results of the first and second phases of purchases (including wheat, yuan wheat, and barley) are as follows: Nanjing District 261.275 bags, Danyang District 26.563 bags, Wuxi District 239.627 bags, Zhenjiang District 160.627 bags, Changzhou District 190.027 bags, Suzhou District 110.439 bags, Bengbu District 143.822 bags, and Jiangbei District 590.330 bags. The total purchase quantity reached 1.937.156 bags. The third phase of purchasing work continued in the districts last December. As of January, it has reached about one million bags. As for entrusting flour mills to produce wheat flour, it has been distributed to Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuxi, Changzhou, Zhenjiang, Suzhou, Yangzhou, Wuhu, and Bengbu districts, reaching 163.570 bags (this allocation figure is up to the end of October).</p>
<h3>Police Bureau Examination of Scripts: Regulations</h3>
<p>The Municipal Police Bureau, in accordance with Article 17 of the Regulations for the Inspection of Plays: "For any script with an approved performance license, the license shall be submitted to the local police agency for examination before performance, and hung in a conspicuous place at the entrance of the theater for identification," and has been resolved and approved by the Shanghai Special Municipality Script Review Committee. Therefore, any theater should follow the previous regulations, and after obtaining the approved performance license, attach a detailed report and immediately submit it to the Inspection Section of the Special High Section of the bureau for examination, in order to be solemn and comply with the law.</p>
<h3>Deadline for Retail Sugar Merchants to Pay and Deliver Goods</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office recently stated that the 17th round of per capita sugar has been allocated by the office. It is scheduled to issue purchase certificates on January 4th and 5th. All retailers who sell per capita sugar in each district must, within this time limit, stamp the back of the previous red wholesale certificate with the store seal and the seal of the person in charge, and bring the sugar ticket fee (5 jiao per 5 liang) to the office to exchange for a purchase certificate. However, due to the large amount of payment, in consideration of the difficulty for retailers to pay, they are allowed to pay and pick up the goods in two installments. The first payment and pick-up must be completed by the 9th of this month at the designated sugar store, so as not to delay the date of sugar sales. The second payment and pick-up must be completed on the 6th day of the sale. In addition, the warehouse for this period's delivery has been changed to the Zhongfu Warehouse at No. 9, South Bund, A, for centralized distribution. It is hoped that all retailers will pay the sugar store within the time limit and pick up the goods from the warehouse, and do not delay.</p>
<h3>Silk Industry Expert Ms. Zhang Xian Passes Away</h3>
<p>Ms. Zhang Xian was an expert in the silk industry in our country. After graduating from the Huxieguan Sericulture School, she went to the Japanese Higher Sericulture School twice to study sericulture for many years, and went to various places in Japan for investigation. After returning to China, she served as a technician in the Jiangsu Industrial Department and the factory director of Wuxi Yongsheng Silk Factory and Longchang Silk Factory. The raw silk produced by the two factories had extremely high standards and sold well overseas. Ms. Zhang's enthusiasm and perseverance in the national industry have remained the same for more than 20 years. After the outbreak of the war, she raised shares in Shanghai to establish the Shanghai Silk Making Institute and served as the manager. The quality of the products was not inferior to that of the past. Due to restrictions on raw materials, the factory had to close down. Ms. Zhang Xian raised shares again in Suzhou to establish the Guohua Silk Weaving Factory and served as the manager. The silk stockings produced were more durable and beautiful than imported products. After that, Ms. Zhang was planning to weave silk and satin to promote the national industry. Unfortunately, before she could realize her ambitions, she died of cancer at Dahua Hospital at Si Shi on January 2nd. It is said that the funeral will be held at the China Funeral Home at 2 pm on January 4th. The death of Ms. Zhang is not only a loss to the women's community and the silk industry, but also a misfortune for the entire national industry. Everyone who hears it cannot help but regret it.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Orders to Prohibit the Collection of Fishing Industry Donations: Levying Agencies Should Strictly Abide by the Regulations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Government recently stated that the tax rate for fishing industry donations has long been stipulated and announced by the central government. All levying agencies in the city should strictly abide by the regulations and absolutely prohibit extra levies to increase the burden on merchants and people. Yesterday, a special order was issued to all bureaus and departments under its jurisdiction to strictly comply, without delay, so as not to be punished.</p>
<h3>Rural Construction Association Assists in Increasing Production</h3>
<p>Since the Chinese Rural Construction Association moved from Beijing to Shanghai last year, it has been using Shanghai as the center to promote the production increase movement. In addition to establishing the Rural Construction College and operating the Jiafeng and Jialu two farms, and running new villages, it has also gathered local celebrities to establish a Production Increase Design Committee to contribute to the government. In response to the invitation of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, it specifically convened the Fourth Annual Meeting in Suzhou on December 27th and 28th last year to determine the work guidelines for the Republic of China (35th year). Yesterday (2nd), the association convened its first board meeting of this year in Shanghai. Chairman Liao Jianan presided over the meeting and decided that the focus of the association's work this year will shift from Shanghai to Jiangsu. In Shanghai, in addition to the continued operation of the farm, the Rural Construction College has been decided to move to Jiangsu, so that the students of the college can be more practical and integrate textbooks with experience. At the same time, the association will also, with the assistance of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, lead the people of Jiangsu Province and assist the government in promoting the work of increasing production.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the Jiangsu Branch of the Association was also established in Suzhou on December 28th last year. Liao Jianan, the president of the General Assembly, concurrently served as the president, and Sun Yucai, Yuan Shu, and Ren Xiping served as honorary directors.</p>
<h3>Nanshi Self-Defense Corps Positions Will Be Re-adjusted</h3>

In order to ensure that the equipment is carefully arranged, a plan to re-adjust and equip the positions in the entire district will be launched soon. The heads of the three police sub-bureaus in the district are currently discussing and cooperating closely with the Shanghai District Baojia Affairs Office. Once completed, they will start to adjust them separately.</p>

<p>Readers' Scholarship News</p>
<h3>Mr. Lin Hongbin Enthusiastically Responds to Form "Second Beggar Brigade"</h3>
<p>The previous article "The Origin of Organizing the Beggar Brigade" by Mr. Yang Guangzheng expressed deep sympathy. The crisis of our national country is just beginning to rise, and everyone should do their best to save it. Otherwise, like the Jews, even if they are rich, they will be oppressed and ravaged! Educating the outstanding talents of the next generation is to seek the construction of the country and the revival of the nation. This is the responsibility of the public, and no one should shirk it. Seeing Wu Xun begging to run schools really makes us feel grateful! The author's financial resources are weak, but the sense of responsibility does not fall behind others. He raised funds from his friend, Mr. Lin Hongbin, a famous erhu ticket holder in Shanghai. Mr. Lin and ten of his friends (titles listed below) donated 2,000 yuan together, totaling 20,000 yuan, to form the "Second Beggar Brigade". Mr. Lin also hopes that the gentlemen who donated will form a brigade each, and gradually promote it to form a social atmosphere. His enthusiasm is especially admirable. I also hope that all walks of life in Shanghai will follow Wu Xun, the righteous beggar, and unanimously take responsibility, contribute their strength, and donate money to save those who have dropped out of school, revitalize education, revive the nation, and build a group, then this newspaper will be fortunate! Society will be fortunate! (Wang Ruoqi)</p>
