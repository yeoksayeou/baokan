<p>社評</p>
<h3>慘痛的教訓　論聯合國瓜分及管理德國協定</h3>
<p>英美蘇法四國，業於本月五日在柏林簽訂瓜分及管理德國協定，全文已詳載昨日本報。我們耐性地細緻這一所謂「歷史的文件」，所獲得的印　，除了「暴虐」兩個字以外，找不到更適當的形容詞了。很明顯，　是英美帝國主義的又一「傑作」；顧幾年來聯合國以異口同聲，批評德國納粹黨的「暴虐政治」，但是德國幾年米　於佔領區內有沒有　乎這樣的瓜分及管理辦法？英國人自己也有「歷史最頑强」的諺語那麼。這一種暴虐的處分德國方案，對於滿口維持世界和平與安全及以解放者自居的英美人，這一「歷史的文件」又是何等辛辣的諷刺啊！</p>
<p>暴虐和復仇政策，決不能解決國際政治問題，這在幾千年來歷史上已經屢次證明了，不意在這二十世紀，在號稱文明强國的英美蘇法，竟有這種違背人類理性的處分德國方案，令人驚異！聯合國當局這種暴虐的政策，其動機也許有如他們的公報所說，目的在永遠消滅德國軍國主義的復活，達到維持世界永遠和平與安全的理想；但是事實相反，結果不是和平與安全，而是新的戰爭危機！現在德國人民，在敵人的成脅下面，固然不能不暫時低頭忍耐，但是，每一個貫流着他們呱先的忠勇之血的日耳曼人，決不會長期忍辱下去的！</p>
<p>而更加嚴重的，就是在這種只有强權與暴力的處分戰欺國方案，實行之際，就是在這種但知攘奪權利，不惜完全背叛其旦旦之信誓的日子，英美蘇法各國之問本身的衝突，已在波蘭問題，在近東間題和在舊金山會議中開展了！將來自食暴虐報復之惡果的，不僅限於他們施行暴虐的對象，而且還有施行暴虐者本身！雖然，目前特魯曼·邱吉爾·史太林三四會議的呼聲日高一日，極力企圖消泯這種危機，可是，觀乎舊金山會議之僵局，及英美最近反蘇火焰的複燃，這種三頭狐疑縱使舉行了，也不會有什麽結果的。</p>
<p>暴虐的對德處分方案，對於我們東方民族，只能發生一種可能的作用，這作用就是使每一個東方民族認淸，東亞人才長東亞的主人。在這慘痛的教訓之下，將更强力地鼓勵我們東方民族的自尊心，鼓勵我們東方民族以中日兩國爲中心而加强團結，以求貫澈東亞人之東亞的目的。</p>
<h3>沖繩島兩軍激戰　日航空部隊活躍　敵軍似在準備次期攻擊</h3>
<p>琉球羣島基地七日中央社電　日空軍部隊五日夜間曾對冲繩海域敵艦一船加以猛襲，後經判明，始知當時日機曾對敵艦型不詳者三艘實施近距離肉搏戰，並加以猛烈空中雷擊。又日機隊六日復於本島南方海上對敵艦加以猛　。又敵艦船羣數組，逐次接近本島南部地區附近，對日軍陣地實施艦砲射擊，日美兩軍正展開激戰。又六月一日間，敵對全列島戰綫來襲機數，計共一百數十　，　呈活躍狀態。</p>
<p>東京七日中央社電　冲繩本島之戰綫，因逐次移往南面，故地上戰鬥鈕趨劇烈，五日夜於西方海岸登陸之敵軍，其後賡續進犯。又由北南下之敵，亦進抵眞玉橋地區，其行動已稍緩慢，但該方面之敵刻似在準備次期之攻擊。</p>
<p>前　基地七日中央社電　冲理之戰局，現已呈嚴重局面，日空　部隊二十四日於北。中兩機塲降陸作戰以來，雙方花沖島展開之制空權爭奪戰，業經兩週。敵爲挽回制空權之地理的　　起見，似已採用如次方式：　B29型之戰略轟炸：連續三次之轟炸京濱地區，大阪神戶論其次數及規模，均爲前所未有，敵或在企圖動員九百架以上之馬里亞納基地B29型機，以使日本之大都市化成灰燼，此因由上月二十四日迄至該月　之冲繩制空權，遭日義烈空挺隊，神風振武特攻隊之攻擊，而發生頓挫，故企圖藉此作牽制，並切　特攻隊之後繼。　小型機之整頓：敵地上機因北·中兩基地之使用受阻，乃企圖主要由伊江島基地調遣P51·F6F，F4，U等型機，以制壓冲繩天空，幷傾力使北·中兩機塲恢復使用。又出動機動部隊之航空勢力，以確保冲繩之制空權，出動綜計四百架之機數，襲擊日方各基地，其目標在於日基地之航空施設，以期完全控制日特攻隊之活動。　敵機動部隊之動向：沖繩近海之敵機動部隊，均以空母三艘爲主力者，其一羣於三日出現於冲繩東方，又西方之機動部隊，亦逐漸向東北行動中，但均處於日方基地航空隊之威力圈外，而慎重行動中，且迭次於夜間改變方針路，藉隱蔽其目的，此點與前兩月之敵機動部隊行動不同，可知其如何欲迥避日特攻隊之威力矣。</p>
<h3>奧地利亞　仍有戰事</h3>
<p>蘇黎世七日中央社電　據目因斯勃魯克抵達此間之消息稱，在奧地利亞北部仍有德親衛隊約三百名向美軍繼續作戰。</p>
<h3>英美軍損失</h3>

<p>里斯本七日中央社電　莫斯科廣播稱，艾森霍華元帥及蒙高茂萊將軍，業經蘇聯頒贈勝利獎章，聞此係蘇聯最高軍事獎章。</p>
<h3>渝共軍仍摩擦</h3>
<p>里斯本七日中央社電　重慶來電，渝方陳誠將軍昨日承認謂，於過去數月中，時有延安共產黨之衝突，然渝軍曾一再受當局之嚴格訓令，不准向共產黨軍施以攻擊，除非共產黨軍先向渝軍攻擊時，始可還抗。</p>

<h3>浙東觀感（一）</h3>
<p>— 逸飛</p>
<p>杭蕭道上</p>
<p>記者奉派前往浙東考察，所取之路綫乃沿梡　公路，經蕭山紹興抵曹娥江畔，再渡江達對岸之百官，直放寗波，再轉往奉化，以家山爲終點。全程總計三百二十四公星。（滬梡段除外）以戰時交通之不能暢達故沿途候車屢作停留，往返共費時半月。</p>
<p>行路維艱</p>
<p>次行觀感，最堪痛惡者，在途中不時見到大部份關卡軍警對於一般旅客，任意勒索，及財務之損失。此輩軍警每於檢查旅客　時，常將旅客之什物強行納諸已　，佔爲已有，較之索　，更為公開，這種軍警之非法行爲，前此僅屬耳聞，目睹實情，令人深痛絕惡。即以杭州爲例，由市區出發前往對岸西興（蕭山縣屬），僅錢塘一江之隔，由鳳山門起，須連過五關，尤以鳳山門與西興兩關卡，最爲兇很，到旅客百般留難，以各地市民證之不能通行爲藉口，索鉅額之賄賂，其數額視人而異，由數千至數萬元不等。旅客稍有申辯，巨掌立至，且以撕毀其住居證爲恐嚇。纏繞多時，旅客登程心急，終至屈服。據一般估計，每卡每日，非法勒索之收入，其總數約在六七十萬至百萬之譜。最奇者即此等軍警竟公開宣稱，彼輩須每日報效其「上峯」鉅額「開額」，（鳳如山門之警察謂每日須報效十六萬元之鉅）而西興之蕭山縣警察，則謂彼等之職位，皆係用去鉅額賄金買來者，爲求血本之歸還，故不得不仰諸旅客之維特。按浙省新省長丁默邨氏，近方赴任，下車　始，希望對不法軍警之戰外行動，嚴加取締，以便行旅。</p>
<p>五月十四日上午十時由杭市起程，在由三郎廟第一碼頭（浙省建設管轄）買棹渡錢塘江，至義渡碼頭，經「長橋」，橋木泰半燬壞，行經其上，頗感心惴。尤以孩童，如稍一不愼，大有墜江之危。過江後即搭乘華中之公共汽車，於十二時半前往蕭山，兩地相隔僅十一公里，故僅費時約三刻即達，票價計兩千元。</p>
<p>蕭山一</p>
<p>一時許車抵蕭山，旅客至此，前往紹興者，例須換車。車停蕭山西山山腳，時值炎陽施虐，車中悶熱不堪，以尚有兩小時逗留，乘機往街頭巡禮，蕭山縣城已廢，僅有遺址數處，可供遊人之憑弔。城區面積不廣，四境多山，全縣人口約十二萬，農民佔多數。以出產貧乏，故民生極苦。縣城中僅臨近汽車站衹國寺旁之「長街」一條，長約二里，兩旁皆零星小店，全城之房屋於事變時受砲火之洗禮，毀壞過半，殘垣斷璧觸目皆是。於東門外有巨大之烟囱，　然獨立，詢諸鄉人知爲戰前「通和公」紡廠之原址，廠房已蕩然無存，荒凉一片，滿停棺木，鄉人言下頗有不勝今昔之感</p>
<p>蕭山對外之交通，除有公路直達錢塘江邊與紹興外，由杭市出發並有火車可通，至紹興則尚有華中鐵道，（現改稱中支那交通團）所屬之小火輪可乘，惜前者近告停頓，後者則又無定期，兼以沿途治安不靖，中途時受狙擊，故班數至少，客商不能利用，其對交通上之貢獻至微。</p>
<h3>B29型敵機　襲大阪神戶　判明被擊落六十八架</h3>
<p>東京七日中央社電　中部軍管區司令部本月七日下午二時發表：　南方地區之敵B29型機約二百五十架，七日上午十時左右由紀伊水道方面侵入大阪市四周地區，專混合投下燒夷彈及炸彈，十時四十分左右迄下午一時十分間，逐次由熊野灘退去，大阪市北部及棄北部發生之火災，經遂次撲滅。　戰果及被害情形，現正調查中。</p>
<p>東京七日中央社電　敵B29型機約三百五十架，五日晨來襲神戶，日軍猛烈迎擊後，經詳細調查結果，判明確實擊落其六十八架，擊破者亦達一百六十架。又擊落之六十八架內，有由地上砲火擊洛者，其他三十七架，則在空戰時擊落。</p>
<p>福岡六日中央社電　敵小型機約三十架，分成五編隊，在哨戒飛艇二架引導下，六日下午三時許起至四時左右，從志布志灣作多岬附近侵入，在大隅半島，薩摩半島上空行動，過四時後照原路逸去，該批敵機大約在冲繩基地起飛，企圖制壓日軍特攻力量。</p>
<h3>苛待蘇戰時罪犯　蘇聯對英不滿</h3>
<p>里斯本七日中央社電　據倫敦公報宣稱，關於蘇聯遣歸罪犯人民委員會委員高立考夫將軍，對於英政府苛待在英國集中營內之蘇聯戰時罪犯一節，曾向蘇新聞機構提出不滿之表示，幷希望英政府能對此項表示立即置答。</p>
<h3>六國糧食會議</h3>
<p>里斯本七日中央社電　據此間接獲英京消息稱，英政府曾發起召開一六國糧食會議，專爲討論在歐洲之糧食情形，此項被邀請之國家爲荷蘭，比利時，法蘭西，丹麥，挪威五國，彼等均於被解放後，一直由英政府供給糧食。</p>
<h3>希特勒屍體</h3>
<p>瑞典京城七日中央社電　英國某軍事訪員昨日談稱，聯合國統治委員會於週二召開會議時，柏林全城轟傳蘇聯探索家曾在柏林某地發現一酷似希特勒元首之燒焦屍體。</p>
<h3>伊朗新閣總辭</h3>

<p>里斯本七日中央社電　里約熱內盧來電，巴西政府七日宣言，與日本國間處於戰爭狀熊。</p>
<h3>四國行使管理權　願與聯合國諮商　蘇方擬分散英美軍力</h3>
<p>里斯本七日中央社電華盛頓電稱，美·英·蘇·法四國政府，五日發表聲明，其原文如次：美·英·蘇三國政府及法國臨時政府，五月五日於柏林發表聲明後，巳握有管理德國之最高權力，四國政府於茲宣布，四國願與其他聯合國政府就行使管理機上進行諮商。</p>
<p>三國任命政治顧問</p>
<p>里斯本七日中央社電　英·美·蘇三國駐德佔領軍之政治顧問，前曾同時兼任中歐管理委員會民生部代表，茲據倫敦來電稱，英政府亦已任命歐洲諮詢委員曾之英國代表斯特朗爲英軍顧問，美軍顧問由馬非担任，蘇聯恐將任命人民委員曾副議</p>
<p>里斯本七日中央社電　美記者密特爾頓，於某紐約公報上著論稱，四國軍事領袖，各偕最高政治及軍事顧問所舉行之首次聯合國統治委員會會議，於四國簽訂處置戰敗德國之聯合宣言後，草率結來。據稱，巨哥夫將軍僅有權代表莫斯科簽訂此項聯合宣言而巳，故於席間渠不願參與討論統治委員會之組織案及各項程序與方式，靜待其他三國代表解決各項重要問題。該記者復論稱，「現蘇聯當局欲愼重考慮者，爲分解西歐兩主要聯盟國（英·美）之軍力，彼正等待美軍退出一部份之蘇軍佔領區及英軍從易北河西部地區後撤，巨哥夫將軍之不欲參與各項問題，實不外爲此原因，然除非四國政府聯合發表劃定佔領區分界綫，否則英。美軍力將不能完全分散。</p>
<p>蘇報刊登佔領區圖</p>
<p>瑞典京城七日中央社電　倫敦公報稱，蘇聯某新聞報昨刊登一詳細地圖，將第一次四國當局頒文中詳述之德境蘇佔領區域輸廓予以　明，該項地圖一面證實各項有關地域劃分之報告，一面指明蘇聯佔領區將起自魯勃克爲英國佔領區），包括馬格德堡，紹林　亞全區及整個蕯克森地區。此項公開刊登蘇佔領區之詳圖，實有關於蘇當局會提出區域劃分之分配事宜應火速開始及英。美軍應速即自劃定爲蘇聯佔領區內撤退之兩項要求，如美國欲實施撤退之行動，則美國不得不放棄薩克森及紹林結亞兩地區內一百五十公里之地，該地包括來比錫。張尼茲·哈里·德騷·威瑪·基那·埃森那許。同時美國亦須自德國中部退出六十公里，包括馬格德堡。而英國之撤退將使英國放棄一小部份之地區，包括波羅的海上面之威斯瑪市區，一般人相信，英·美當局均深望同時能解決奧地利亞佔領區之劃分事宜，現已抵達維也納之英·美軍事使節團，正從事研究解決此事。</p>

<h3>沖繩敵軍　遭受空前損害　軍事專家評世界局勢</h3>
<p>本市某軍事評論專家，頃就最近戰局及國際形勢發我談話如左：</p>
<p>在冲繩島南方陸上那霸飛機塲港口，以及首里南方，激戰進行中。日軍主力部隊，仍予敵以英大打擊。冲繩周圍海上，日特攻隊冒惡劣天氣，向敵艦隊猛攻，敵受創極重，截至目下，敵損害陸上人數，約八萬名。若以每擊沉一襤，損失百分之七十五，擊破一艦，損失百分之五十計算，其損失數當在三十二萬名以上，兩共四十萬人。以過去雷伊泰·明多羅·伊江及沖繩等地之損害數目計之，每次均見增加。據紐約泰晤士報漢森　特恩氏稱，美軍人員之損失，殊爲嚴重，特發出警吿。又勞倫斯稱：美軍在冲繩作戰，其所受損失，較珍珠港爲尤重，故擬組織調查委會，從事調查。由此可證明美國繼續討日作戰，其人員損書，必更增加無疑。日軍出以以一殺百之特攻隊精神，結果美軍人員之損害，必成一極嚴重間題。據三日會在冲繩島指揮機動部隊之美軍官米却中將，在華或頓對新聞記者稱：日特攻隊所用之戰術，爲急降下式，其犧牲只有一人，而命中之方法，實較普通攻擊式爲優秀，故今後對於此種咸脅，美軍應利用一切措置，以謀應付。同時漢淼鮑特恩亦稱：此次美軍之損失，海上部隊較陸上爲多，可以證明日特攻隊之成功，故今後戰爭之勝利，必屬日本無疑。又呂宋島康加因，聖太非，明多竊，泰拉干，玻根維爾島之布因等處，日本戰意昂揚，仍繼續激戰中。</p>
<p>對德處理問題</p>
<p>據六月七日舊金山廣播稱：美英蘇聯法代表所組織之聯合最高統　委會，曾在柏林協議關於德國無條件降服之項目，已在倫敦·莫斯科·華盛頓·巴黎四處發表。德國境依照一九三七年十二月三十一日所規定者，劃分爲四區，西北歸英，西南歸美，東部屬蘇，法得西之一部，此種措置與若輩所高唱之戰後和平論調，究有何種貢獻，殊屬疑問。更以第一次大戰後二十年中之事實，及最近所謂新的世界組織視之，實覺其渺茫之至。各國擬將奧大利捷克與德分離，此在日耳曼民族，無論其在歐洲或世界，勢必形成痛之存在</p>
<p>近東問題</p>
<p>黎巴嫩各國紛爭，在軍事上雖告一段落，但政治上仍未結束。據舊金山六月六日廣播稱：特戈爾將軍曾要求殊聯中國參加討論協議，即五大國會議，但邱吉爾氏認爲此必需要長的時間，因而加以拒絕。又邱氏在下院表示，美英法三國應即出面調停此料紛問題。我人根據第一次歐戰所引起種種之糾紛，加以最近回教圈之社會問題視之，其情形實極形複雜。</p>
<p>舊金山會議</p>
<p>六月六日舊金山發表倫敦泰晤士報評舊金山會議稱：關於否決權問題，美英蘇法中各國意見極不一致。舊金山路透社特派員司坦萊巴却稱：特魯曼。邱吉爾對史太林曾提出達到妥協點之要求，對此問題，如各國意見不一，再加以委任統制權之糾紛，則舊金山會議結果，勢必成一泡影。在將閉會前竟充滿種種糾紛，可知此會議已成爲虎頭蛇尾，將必以不了了之。現美派往莫斯科之霍布金氏，歸返華盛頓，一再愆期，與此亦實有莫大之關連有在也</p>
<p>國共摩擦</p>
<p>據路透社六日重慶電：渝軍政部長陳誠承認數月來，渝共間有種種摩擦存在。又稱：美貸予之軍火，絕未用於對共戰事。宋子文之訪問莫斯科，此種問題，必更引起因難無疑。陳氏對國共摩擦之責任稱，應由共黨負之。過去此一問題，經許久沉默，而今又暴露其目的，無非有藉此宣傳之意味耳。六中全會開會後，第一次執委會之常務委員名額增加，除去孔祥熙補入吳鐵城。此對民族主義之革新派，不無獻媚之表現存在也。</p>

<h3>Japanese Army Garrison Unit Launches Bayonet Attack; Commander of Tarakan Dies in Battle</h3>
<p>Southern Front Base, 7th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The Japanese garrison unit on Tarakan Island has been engaging the enemy's powerful landing force for days, launching bayonet attacks, increasing the enemy's casualties. On April 25th, when the Japanese army's suicide squad launched a fierce attack on the enemy, the highest commander of the American landing force, Lieutenant General Serisi, was shot in the abdomen and died in battle.</p>
<p>Southern Front Base, 7th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Since the enemy landed on Tarakan, Himaat-kun, a member of the local volunteer force who has been advancing with the Japanese soldiers and fighting actively on the front lines, carried explosives and charged into an enemy machine gun position during a night attack on May 21st, destroying it and fulfilling his final aspiration. On the 3rd, the Supreme Commander of the Southern Navy praised his meritorious deeds and announced them to the entire army.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting Continues in the Davao Area</h3>
<p>Philippine Islands Front, 7th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Fierce fighting continues in the Davao area of Mindanao Island. On the 1st, about two enemy companies, with five armored vehicles, attacked the Monte-gu area under the cover of mortars. On the afternoon of the 2nd, two more armored vehicles were reinforced and attacked east of Monte-gu. The Japanese army immediately launched a counterattack, and a bloody battle is now underway.</p>
<h3>The Tragic Spirit of the Japanese Special Attack Corps</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Oahira Takayoshi, director of the Domei News Agency's editorial department, visited various special attack bases for a week and returned to Tokyo on the 6th. According to his account of the heroic situation at each base, special attack planes that will never return are sent to Okinawa every day. The members of the special attack corps who board the "Shinryu" are calm and composed. These members all firmly believe that air power will win, and that certain death and a certain hit are the foundation of victory. I once heard the commander's instructions before departure, and his tragic spirit was deeply engraved in my heart. We were born in Japan, inheriting 2,600 years of brilliant history, and we must continue this ancestral history forever. The history of tomorrow depends on us to create. We must not disgrace our ancestors, but follow in the footsteps of the loyal Nanmasasue and march forward boldly. The members of the special attack corps have no doubts, only believing that loyalty will win, and persevering to the end. Each base has a self-sufficient system, and everyone from the commander to the military personnel is working hard to fight and produce at the same time.</p>
<h3>The Chongqing Army Newly Establishes the Jiangsu and Zhejiang War Zones</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 7th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The Chongqing army, which is clamoring for a mainland offensive, seems to be preparing on a large scale to establish new war zones to serve as anti-Japanese bases. According to a recent broadcast from Chongqing, the Chongqing army has recently established strategic bases in the Henan strategic area and other places. Because the American army intends to land on the Chinese mainland for operations, it has newly established the Jiangsu and Zhejiang war zones.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Gu Returns to His Post</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Gu Zhengzhi, the Japanese ambassador to China, returned to his country in early April to report on his work, and arrived in Shanghai by plane on the 5th. He returned to Nanjing on the 7th.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Painful Lessons: On the United Nations Agreement on Partitioning and Governing Germany</h3>
<p>The four countries of Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France signed an agreement in Berlin on the 5th of this month on partitioning and governing Germany. The full text has been published in yesterday's newspaper. After patiently and meticulously studying this so-called "historical document," the impression we gained, apart from the word "tyranny," could not find a more appropriate term. It is clear that this is another "masterpiece" of British and American imperialism. Considering that the United Nations has, for several years, unanimously criticized the "tyrannical politics" of the German Nazi Party, is there any difference between this kind of partitioning and governing method and what the Germans did in the occupied territories for several years? The British themselves have the proverb of "history is the most stubborn." What a pungent irony this "historical document" is to the British and Americans, who are full of maintaining world peace and security and posing as liberators!</p>
<p>Policies of tyranny and revenge can never solve international political problems. This has been repeatedly proven throughout thousands of years of history. It is unexpected that in this twentieth century, in the so-called civilized powers of Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France, there is such a German scheme that violates human reason, which is surprising! The motive for this tyrannical policy of the United Nations authorities may be, as their communiqué stated, to permanently eliminate the revival of German militarism and achieve the ideal of maintaining world peace and security; but the opposite is true, and the result is not peace and security, but a new war crisis! Now the German people, under the threat of the enemy, certainly cannot but bow their heads and endure for the time being, but every German who has the courageous blood of their ancestors flowing through them will never endure humiliation for long!</p>
<p>What is even more serious is that at the time of implementing this plan to punish the defeated country, which is based only on power and violence, at the time of knowing only how to seize rights and not hesitating to completely betray its oath, the conflict between Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France themselves has developed in the Polish issue, in the Near East issue, and in the San Francisco Conference! What is in store for those who inflict tyranny is not only the targets of their tyranny, but also the perpetrators themselves! Although the call for a three- or four-way meeting between Truman, Churchill, and Stalin is growing louder and louder, and they are trying to eliminate this crisis, judging from the stalemate at the San Francisco Conference and the recent resurgence of anti-Soviet flames in Britain and the United States, even if such a meeting is held, it will not have any results.</p>
<p>The tyrannical plan for dealing with Germany can only have one possible effect on us Eastern nations, and that is to make every Eastern nation realize that Asians are the masters of Asia. Under this painful lesson, we will more strongly encourage the self-esteem of our Eastern nations, and encourage our Eastern nations to strengthen unity with China and Japan as the center, in order to fulfill the purpose of Asia for Asians.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battles Between the Two Armies on Okinawa Island; Japanese Air Force Active; Enemy Seems to Be Preparing for the Next Attack</h3>
<p>Ryukyu Islands Base, 7th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The Japanese Air Force launched a fierce attack on an enemy ship in the waters off Okinawa on the night of the 5th. After further investigation, it was learned that the Japanese planes carried out close-range bayonet warfare and fierce aerial torpedo attacks on three unidentified enemy ships. On the 6th, Japanese planes again fiercely attacked enemy ships in the sea south of the island. Several groups of enemy ships gradually approached the vicinity of the southern part of the island, carrying out naval gun fire on the Japanese army's positions. Japanese and American forces are engaged in fierce battles. On June 1st, the number of enemy planes attacking the entire island's front line totaled more than one hundred and several dozen, showing an active state.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency Telegram) – As the battle line on Okinawa Island is gradually moving south, the ground fighting is becoming more intense. The enemy forces that landed on the western coast on the night of the 5th continued to advance. The enemy advancing south from the north has also reached the area of Zhenyubi, and its movement has slowed down slightly, but the enemy in that area seems to be preparing for the next attack.</p>
<p>Front Base, 7th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The war situation in Okinawa has now reached a serious stage. Since the Japanese air force units landed at the northern and central airfields on the 24th, the battle for air supremacy over Okinawa Island has been going on for two weeks. In order to regain the geographical advantage of air supremacy, the enemy seems to have adopted the following methods: Strategic Bombing by B29 Type: Continuous three times of bombing the Keihin area, the number and scale of Osaka and Kobe are unprecedented. The enemy may be trying to mobilize more than 900 B29-type aircraft from the Mariana base to turn Japan's major cities into ashes. This is because the Japanese Giretsu Airborne Corps and the Kamikaze Shinbu Special Attack Corps attacked the Okinawan air supremacy from the 24th of last month to the end of that month, which caused a setback, so they tried to use this as a restraint and cut off the succession of the special attack corps. Organization of Small Aircraft: Because the use of the northern and central bases by enemy ground aircraft is obstructed, they are trying to mainly dispatch P51, F6F, F4, U and other types of aircraft from the Ie Island base to suppress the Okinawan sky, and are striving to restore the use of the northern and central airfields. In addition, the air power of the mobile unit was dispatched to ensure the air supremacy of Okinawa, and a total of 400 aircraft were dispatched to attack the Japanese bases, with the aim of the aviation facilities of the Japanese bases, in order to completely control the activities of the Japanese special attack corps. The Movement of Enemy Mobile Units: The enemy mobile units in the vicinity of Okinawa are all based on three aircraft carriers. One group appeared east of Okinawa on the 3rd, and the mobile units in the west are also gradually moving northeast, but they are all in the area outside the range of the Japanese base air force, and are acting cautiously, and have repeatedly changed their course at night to conceal their purpose. This is different from the actions of the enemy mobile units in the previous two months, so it can be seen how they want to avoid the power of the Japanese special attack corps.</p>

<p>Travel Correspondence</p>
<h3>Impressions of Eastern Zhejiang (1)</h3>
<p>– Yifei</p>
<p>On the Hangzhou-Xiaoshan Road</p>
<p>This reporter was dispatched to Eastern Zhejiang for investigation. The route taken was along the Hanyi Highway, passing through Xiaoshan and Shaoxing to the Cao'e River, then crossing the river to Baiguan on the opposite bank, and heading straight to Ningbo, then turning to Fenghua, with the hometown as the end point. The total journey is 324 kilometers. (Excluding the Shanghai-Hangzhou section.) Because wartime transportation is not smooth, stops were made repeatedly along the way to wait for transportation, and it took a total of half a month for the round trip.</p>
<p>Difficulty in Travel</p>
<p>The most detestable aspect of this trip is the frequent sight of checkpoints and military police arbitrarily extorting money from ordinary travelers, resulting in financial losses. These military police often forcibly take travelers' belongings when inspecting them, occupying them as their own. This is more blatant than extortion. These illegal acts of military police were previously only heard of, but witnessing the reality makes one deeply detest and abhor them. Take Hangzhou as an example: to travel from the city to Xixing (belonging to Xiaoshan County) on the opposite bank, separated only by the Qiantang River, you have to pass five checkpoints starting from Fengshanmen. The Fengshanmen and Xixing checkpoints are the most fierce, causing all kinds of difficulties for travelers, using the pretext that citizens' certificates from various places are not valid, and extorting huge amounts of bribes, the amount of which varies from several thousand to tens of thousands of yuan depending on the person. If travelers protest slightly, a large palm will immediately arrive, and they will threaten to tear up their residence permits. After a long time of entanglement, the travelers become impatient to start their journey, and finally give in. According to general estimates, the total amount of illegal extortion income per checkpoint per day is approximately between six or seven hundred thousand to one million yuan. The strangest thing is that these military police openly claim that they have to pay a huge "start-up fee" to their "superiors" every day (the police at Fengshanmen said that they have to pay 160,000 yuan every day), while the Xiaoshan County police in Xixing said that their positions were all bought with huge bribes. In order to recover their capital, they have no choice but to rely on the welfare of travelers. According to Zhejiang Province's new governor, Ding Mocun, who recently took office, and at the beginning of his office, he hopes to strictly prohibit the extra-war actions of illegal military police to facilitate travel.</p>
<p>Starting from Hangzhou City at 10:00 AM on May 14th, I bought a boat at the No. 1 Wharf of Sanlang Temple (under the jurisdiction of Zhejiang Province Construction) to cross the Qiantang River to the Yidu Wharf. We passed the "Long Bridge." Most of the bridge wood was destroyed, and walking on it felt quite uneasy. Especially for children, if they are not careful, there is a great danger of falling into the river. After crossing the river, I took the Huazhong bus to Xiaoshan at 12:30 PM. The two places are only 11 kilometers apart, so it only took about three quarters of an hour to reach, and the fare was 2,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Xiaoshan</p>
<p>When the bus arrived in Xiaoshan around 1:00, travelers who wanted to go to Shaoxing had to change buses. The bus stopped at the foot of Xishan Mountain in Xiaoshan. It was hot and sultry, and the bus was unbearably hot. Since there were still two hours to stay, I took the opportunity to visit the streets. The county seat of Xiaoshan has been abandoned, and there are only a few ruins that can be used for tourists to mourn. The area of the urban area is not large, and there are many mountains in the four borders. The population of the entire county is about 120,000, and most of them are farmers. Because of the lack of production, people's livelihood is extremely difficult. In the county seat, only the "Long Street" next to the Zhiguo Temple near the bus station is about two li long. There are sporadic small shops on both sides. More than half of the houses in the entire city were destroyed by artillery fire during the incident, and broken walls and ruins are everywhere. Outside the east gate, there is a huge chimney standing independently. Asking the villagers, I learned that it was the original site of the "Tonghe Gong" textile factory before the war. The factory buildings have been wiped out, and the area is desolate and full of coffins. The villagers' words are full of feelings about the past and present.</p>
<p>In addition to highways directly to the Qiantang River and Shaoxing, there are also trains from Hangzhou City, and there are also small steamships belonging to the Huazhong Railway (now renamed the Zhongzhina Transportation Group) to Shaoxing. Unfortunately, the former has recently been suspended, and the latter is irregular, and the public security is unstable along the way, and it is often attacked in the middle, so the number of shifts is at least limited, and merchants cannot use it, and its contribution to transportation is minimal.</p>
<h3>B29 Enemy Planes Attack Osaka and Kobe; Confirmed 68 Shot Down</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The Central Military District Headquarters announced at 2:00 PM on the 7th of this month: About 250 B29 type enemy planes from the southern region invaded the surrounding area of Osaka City from the Kii Channel around 10:00 AM on the 7th and exclusively mixedly dropped incendiary bombs and bombs. From around 10:40 AM to 1:10 PM, they gradually retreated from the Kumano Nada. Fires broke out in the northern part of Osaka City, which were gradually extinguished. The results of the battle and the extent of the damage are currently under investigation.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency Telegram) – About 350 B29 type enemy planes attacked Kobe on the morning of the 5th. After the Japanese army fiercely counterattacked, a detailed investigation confirmed that 68 were shot down, and 160 were damaged. Among the 68 shot down, some were shot down by ground fire, and the other 37 were shot down in air combat.</p>
<p>Fukuoka, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) – About 30 enemy small aircraft, divided into five formations and led by two patrol airships, invaded the vicinity of Sata Point from Shibushi Bay from around 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM on the 6th and acted over the Osumi Peninsula and the Satsuma Peninsula. After 4:00 PM, they returned to their original route. The enemy aircraft probably took off from Okinawa Base and tried to suppress the Japanese army's special attack forces.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Expresses Dissatisfaction with Britain for Harshly Treating Soviet Wartime Criminals</h3>

<h3>Six-Nation Food Conference</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 7th (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to information received here from London, the British government has initiated a six-nation food conference specifically to discuss the food situation in Europe.

<h3>Hitler's Body</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 7th (Central News Agency Telegram) – A British military reporter said yesterday that during a meeting of the United Nations Governing Council on Tuesday, the entire city of Berlin was rumored that Soviet explorers had discovered a charred body resembling the head of Hitler in a certain place in Berlin.</p>
<h3>The Iranian Cabinet Resigns</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 7th (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to a telegram from Tehran, the Iranian Cabinet, which was newly formed on the 11th of last month, resigned en masse on the 4th because it failed to obtain the trust of the parliament.</p>
<h3>American Lend-Lease Military Budget</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 7th (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to a telegram from Washington, American President Truman requested Congress on the 4th to increase the total amount of the Lend-Lease military budget for the new fiscal year starting on July 1st to US$1.975 billion.</p>
<h3>Brazil Declares War on Japan</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 7th (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to a telegram from Rio de Janeiro, the Brazilian government declared on the 7th that it is at war with Japan.</p>
<h3>Four Countries Exercise Administrative Power, Willing to Consult with the United Nations, Soviet Side Plans to Disperse British and American Military Strength</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 7th (Central News Agency) – Washington reports that the governments of the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France issued a statement on the 5th, the original text of which is as follows: The governments of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, and the Provisional Government of France, having issued a statement in Berlin on May 5th, have now assumed supreme authority over the administration of Germany. The four governments hereby announce that they are willing to consult with other United Nations governments regarding the exercise of administrative power.</p>
<p>Three Countries Appoint Political Advisors</p>
<p>Lisbon, 7th (Central News Agency) – The political advisors of the British, American, and Soviet occupation forces in Germany, who previously also served as representatives of the Civil Affairs Department of the Central European Management Committee, according to a telegram from London, the British government has also appointed Sir William Strang, the former British representative to the European Advisory Commission, as advisor to the British forces. The American military advisor will be Mr. Murphy. It is feared that the Soviet Union will appoint a Deputy People's Commissar.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 7th (Central News Agency) – American journalist Mr. Middleton, in an article in a New York publication, stated that the first meeting of the Allied Control Council, attended by the military leaders of the four countries, each accompanied by top political and military advisors, concluded hastily after the four countries signed a joint declaration regarding the disposition of defeated Germany. It is reported that General Zhukov was only authorized to sign this joint declaration on behalf of Moscow, and therefore, during the meeting, he was unwilling to participate in discussions regarding the organization of the Control Council and its various procedures and methods, and silently waited for the representatives of the other three countries to resolve various important issues. The journalist further commented, "The Soviet authorities are now cautiously considering dispersing the military strength of the two major Western European allies (Britain and the United States). They are waiting for the American forces to withdraw from a portion of the Soviet occupation zone and for the British forces to withdraw from the western region of the Elbe River. General Zhukov's unwillingness to participate in various issues is nothing more than for this reason. However, unless the four governments jointly issue a demarcation line for the occupation zones, the British and American military strength cannot be completely dispersed."</p>
<p>Soviet Newspaper Publishes Map of Occupation Zone</p>
<p>Stockholm, 7th (Central News Agency) – A London dispatch states that a Soviet newspaper yesterday published a detailed map clearly outlining the Soviet occupation zone in Germany as detailed in the first document issued by the four occupying powers. The map both confirms the reports concerning the division of the territories and indicates that the Soviet occupation zone will start from Lübeck (British occupation zone), including Magdeburg, the entire region of Saxony-Anhalt, and the entire Saxony region. The public publication of this detailed map of the Soviet occupation zone is in fact related to the two demands that the Soviet authorities will propose: that the allocation of zonal division matters should begin immediately, and that the British and American troops should withdraw immediately from the areas designated as the Soviet occupation zone. If the United States wishes to implement the withdrawal, it will have to abandon 150 kilometers of territory in the Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt regions, including Leipzig, Zwickau, Halle, Dessau, Weimar, Jena, and Eisenach. At the same time, the United States must withdraw 60 kilometers from central Germany, including Magdeburg. The British withdrawal will require Britain to abandon a small portion of the area, including the city of Wismar on the Baltic Sea. It is generally believed that the British and American authorities both hope to resolve the division of the Austrian occupation zone at the same time. The British and American military delegations that have arrived in Vienna are currently working on resolving this matter.</p>

<h3>18th Air Defense Day, Implementing Various Training Exercises, Creating a Unified Sino-Japanese Defense Concept</h3>
<p>Tomorrow (the 9th) is the 18th Air Defense Day. The City Air Defense Headquarters will, as usual, expand publicity on the meaning of air defense and implement various air defense training exercises. The timing of the alarm training has been stipulated and detailed in yesterday's newspapers. Citizens should implement various necessary measures in accordance with the stipulated time. However, during the alarm issuance exercises at 4 PM and 9 PM, traffic control, light control, and shelter drills will be implemented throughout the city, but no alarms will be sounded. If there is an actual air raid situation during this alarm issuance exercise, air raid sirens will be sounded in accordance with regulations, and citizens should pay attention to this.</p>
<p>Local Training</p>
<p>Furthermore, this local comprehensive training exercise will be implemented within the jurisdictions of the Hongkou, West Hongkou, and Zhabei sub-bureaus. The sub-bureaus within these jurisdictions should lead police and security personnel, as well as the public, to implement various comprehensive air defense training exercises as before, and allow more Japanese residents to share skills and enthusiastic air defense thinking, thereby creating a fundamental concept of unified Sino-Japanese regional defense and an unshakable foundation.</p>
<p>Other Training</p>
<p>At the same time, each district will designate appropriate locations to implement various air defense training exercises such as bomb extinguishing, firefighting, first aid, and sheltering. Personnel will be dispatched from the Air Defense Headquarters and the respective sub-bureaus to provide guidance. Alarm personnel and local residents must participate in the exercises. The special defense groups of various factories and buildings, and the air defense groups of various schools, will also implement various air defense training exercises to ensure that all citizens are proficient in air defense measures and prepared to cope with emergencies.</p>
<p>Xujiahui District Strengthens Air Defense</p>
<p>The Xujiahui Police Sub-bureau, in view of the fact that this month from the 1st to the 9th is the Civil Air Defense Facilities Strengthening Week, has specifically convened the Chief of the Xujiahui District and the Chief of the Neighborhood Association to supervise the residents within the district to rush to dig individual air defense trenches and prepare household air defense equipment. At the same time, the sub-bureau has formulated various training plans for the 18th Air Defense Day and has scheduled a meeting on the 6th to convene cadres of the air defense district to discuss and guide the implementation methods. At the same time, in order to ensure the security of the district, they are very active in clearing the household registration. The survey and statistics were completed at the end of May, with a total of 3,119 regular households, 3,419 attached households, and a total of 45,055 men and women. There are also 252 foreigners (Catholic Church Aid).</p>
<h3>Evacuation Committee Schedules Regular Sailings, Suzhou Evacuation Ships, Changshu and Songjiang Lines Will Also Be Launched</h3>
<p>Since the Municipal Population Evacuation Committee began its work, it has spared no effort in promoting preparations for evacuating citizens. It is currently scheduled to start the Suzhou evacuation ship on the 11th of this month. The fare is 3,330 yuan per person, and it is free for children under ten years old. The ship departs every morning at 5:00 AM. Evacuees can go to the Executive Group of the committee (attached to the Fourth Section of the Baojia Group of each police sub-bureau) to apply for registration and proceed with the move. In order to facilitate the evacuation of citizens, it is said that the procedures are extremely simple. If there are any doubts, you can go to the Evacuation Committee of this newspaper at Yikou Road to consult everything, or call 93248. Furthermore, the committee stated that the operation of special trains on land, the Changshu and Songjiang lines, will also be launched, and preparations for special lines to other places are also being actively made to achieve the maximum effect of the evacuation work.</p>
<p>Hometown Associations Can Apply for Assistance in Evacuation</p>
<p>Regarding the evacuation of the population of this city, the Municipal Government has organized a Population Evacuation Committee to coordinate and handle it. Various hometown associations affiliated with the Municipal Social Welfare Bureau have repeatedly requested instructions from the bureau on how to handle the evacuation of the population due to unclear procedures. It is now learned that the bureau has been instructed by the Municipal Government to forward the draft of the Population Evacuation Committee on measures to assist various hometown associations in evacuating the population, and provisional rules for handling applications for evacuation flags and evidentiary documents have been approved. In the future, if various hometown associations in this city are handling the evacuation of the population and need the assistance of the committee, they can apply to the committee.</p>
<h3>Police Bureau Encourages Police Officers, Issues Bonuses</h3>
<p>Zhou, the director of the Municipal Police Bureau, in order to encourage police officers, in addition to promoting outstanding personnel, has also specially issued bonuses of 20,000 yuan per person to all police officers below the rank of section chief (including those without confidential expenses) and 10,000 yuan per person to the servants to show encouragement and inspire them. The bonuses will be disbursed starting on the 8th.

<p>Rice for the First Half of the Month Distributed Today</p>
<p>In addition, in order to improve the treatment of police officers, the bureau will distribute free rice to Chinese staff to stabilize their lives. It is learned that the free allocation of rice for the first half of June has been completed by the Police Welfare Society and will be distributed starting today.</p>
<p>Change of Head of Jiangning Road Sub-bureau</p>
<p>Also, the head of the Jiangning Road Sub-bureau, Song Yuan, has submitted his resignation, which has been approved. The vacancy will be filled by Zhu Wenneng, who officially took over the affairs of the bureau yesterday.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Commends Zhao Haiqing</h3>
<p>The Municipal Construction Bureau believes that the road administration of the Shangyong and Shangnan Roads has not been handled well in the past, which has greatly affected the traffic in the suburbs. It has specifically instructed the management offices of the two roads to start improvements. Through the active rectification of Zhao Haiqing, the director of the office, the road administration has been renewed and travel has become convenient. The Municipal Construction Bureau believes that Zhao Haiqing has handled the matter well and has now applied to the Municipal Government to commend him with a formal order.</p>
<h3>Summer Business Tax Scheduled to be Levied</h3>
<p>The Municipal Finance Bureau's collection of business entertainment tax from the old First District and the Eighth District has been carried out since the collection of the spring business tax started this year. The tax amounts due for January, February, and March by various industrial and commercial factories have been mostly reported and paid successively. The business tax collection offices in each district of the bureau have been dispatching personnel to review the work in recent days, which is very tense. It is learned that the summer business tax (April, May, and June) has been scheduled to be levied starting on the 11th of this month. All tax amounts will be levied in proportion to the actual business amount of each manufacturer in January, February, and March.</p>
<p>Special Tea House Tax Not Allowed to Open</p>
<p>The special tax section of the Municipal Finance Bureau only has types such as wood, bamboo, livestock, etc. However, recently someone suggested to the bureau to collect a special business tax for tea houses and water shops, and requested permission to try it out. It is learned that the responsible authorities of the bureau, after considering the matter, believe that if the special tax is implemented, the burden on merchants and the people will be heavy, which will further stimulate prices. Therefore, the proposers were instructed that to open a tea house, they must apply to the bureau for a business license, pay the license business tax, and collect the special consumption tax on behalf of the government. The request to open a special business tax for tea houses and water shops in this city is close to excessive and cannot be approved.</p>
<h3>Education Issues Mayor's Scholarship</h3>
<p>In order to reward outstanding students from poor families, the Municipal Education Bureau has established the Mayor's Scholarship. All forty students who have won the award in the past will be exempted from tuition fees this semester in accordance with regulations, and each will be issued a scholarship of 10,000 yuan as an encouragement. The bureau has ordered all schools to collect and forward the scholarship. It is also heard that the bureau, with the mayor's intention to reward outstanding students and subsidize the poor, will expand the number of awards and increase the scholarship amount starting from the next academic year.</p>
<p>Physical Education Teachers Training Concludes</p>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau's third training class for national simple gymnastics and youth exercises has completed its training period. The graduation ceremony is scheduled to be held at 9:00 AM on the 8th. After the end of this class, the Education Bureau will still periodically select physical education teachers from various suburban schools for training.</p>
<h3>Summer Water Consumption Reduced by 30% of Limit, Adjustments Can Be Applied for if Consumption is Insufficient</h3>
<p>The Municipal Water Company Authority stated that since the summer season has arrived, the water demand of each user will increase accordingly. Starting today, the water consumption can be handled according to the summer limit, but in order to strengthen water conservation, the limit will be reduced by another 30%, which is calculated as 70% of the limit stated in the original notification. According to the business authorities of the company, the reduction of the summer water limit for citizens is actually to strengthen water conservation. It is hoped that all users will cooperate in saving water and ensure that the amount of water used does not exceed the limit. If there is any confusion about the limit, or if the limit is insufficient for use, you can directly negotiate with them, and it is hoped that you will provide a written statement of the number of people and the amount of water required for consideration and adjustment.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry Investigates Electricity Demand of Factories in This City, Prepared for Reference in Adjusting Power Distribution</h3>
<p>In order to maintain the production of major factories in this city, the Ministry of Industry has decided to find ways to adjust the power supply. In order to understand the actual electricity demand of each factory, it has ordered the China National Industries Association to conduct a survey on the current electricity demand of factories with excellent performance and perfect equipment in this city for reference in implementing power distribution adjustment. After receiving the order, the association has now begun planning and implementing it. It is reported that the factories to be surveyed by the ministry include: knitted goods, wool fibers, wool products, silk factories, silk fabrics, commercial products, blended fabrics, Western medicine, pigments, dyes, alcohol, chemical industrial raw materials, and other products, industrial oils, coal balls, cigarettes and tobacco leaves, rubber, hardware, electrical appliances, leather, papermaking, etc. It is also learned that the association is also conducting a survey on the electricity demand of daily necessities factories in this city.</p>
<h3>Reorganization of the Business Control Association Submitted to the Executive Yuan for Approval</h3>
<p>After the reorganization of the National General Chamber of Commerce and Industry, another year has expired. Whether the term of office of all directors and supervisors will be renewed, matters that should be promoted or reformed in the organization, and the future policy of purchasing new agricultural products, the association has submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. At the same time, it also urges the Rice and Grain, Flour and Wheat, Oil Grain, Cotton Industry, Daily Necessities and other control committees to quickly prepare a summary of the implementation of control business over the past year for submission to the Executive Yuan for review.</p>
<h3>Illegal Discounting of Negotiable Instruments Should Be Cracked Down On</h3>
<p>There is a lack of cash in this city, and the practice of discounting crossed checks and fund transfer orders is still rampant. The source of cash for these small money houses deserves attention. The Central Reserve Authorities also clarified their determination to crack down on such illegal discounting. However, according to reporters, the discounting is still being carried out openly and secretly. Not long ago, the discount per yuan was only three or four cents, but it suddenly jumped to seven or eight cents yesterday. The competent authorities should find ways to strictly crack down on it, and the whereabouts of the vouchers received by each bank and bank should also be secretly investigated.</p>

<h3>Enemy Forces in Okinawa Suffer Unprecedented Damage: Military Expert Assesses World Situation</h3>
<p>A certain military commentator in this city recently gave me the following statement regarding the recent war situation and international landscape:</p>
<p>Fierce battles are underway on the ground south of Okinawa Island, at the Naha airfield and port, and south of Shuri. The main Japanese forces continue to inflict significant blows on the enemy. In the seas surrounding Okinawa, Japanese special attack units brave severe weather to launch fierce attacks on the enemy fleet, causing heavy damage. As of now, enemy losses on land are approximately 80,000 personnel. If we calculate based on a loss of 75% for each ship sunk and 50% for each ship damaged, the losses at sea would be over 320,000, totaling 400,000. Considering the losses in previous battles at Leyte, Mindoro, Ie Shima, and Okinawa, the numbers increase with each encounter. According to Hanson W. Baldwin of *The New York Times*, the losses of American personnel are extremely serious, prompting a warning. Lawrence also stated that the losses suffered by the U.S. military in the Okinawa campaign are more severe than those at Pearl Harbor, hence the plan to form a commission of inquiry to investigate. This proves that American continued operations against Japan will undoubtedly lead to even greater personnel losses. The Japanese military, with its spirit of "one kills a hundred" in special attack units, will inevitably make the American personnel losses a severely critical problem. According to Lieutenant General Millard Harmon, the U.S. commander of mobile forces on Okinawa Island, speaking to reporters in Washington on the 3rd, the Japanese special attack units use a dive-bombing tactic. With the sacrifice of only one person, the accuracy is superior to ordinary attacks. Therefore, the U.S. military should utilize all possible measures to deal with this threat. At the same time, Hanson Baldwin also stated that the U.S. losses in this operation are greater at sea than on land, which proves the success of the Japanese special attack units. Therefore, victory in the future war will undoubtedly belong to Japan. Furthermore, in Kangas in Luzon Island, Santa Fe, Mindoro, Tarakan, and Buin in Bougainville Island, Japanese morale is high, and fierce battles continue.</p>
<p>Handling the German Issue</p>
<p>According to a broadcast from San Francisco on June 7, the Allied Supreme Command Committee, consisting of representatives from the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France, reached an agreement in Berlin regarding the terms of Germany's unconditional surrender, which has been announced in London, Moscow, Washington, and Paris. The territory of Germany is divided into four zones as defined on December 31, 1937: the northwest to Britain, the southwest to the United States, the east to the Soviet Union, and a portion of the west to France. It is questionable what contribution this measure will make to the postwar peace advocated by these powers. Considering the events of the twenty years after the First World War and the recent so-called new world organization, it seems extremely vague. The various countries plan to separate Austria and Czechoslovakia from Germany, which will inevitably form a painful existence for the Germanic people, whether in Europe or the world.</p>
<p>Near East Problem</p>
<p>The conflicts among the countries of Lebanon have come to an end militarily, but they are not yet resolved politically. According to a broadcast from San Francisco on June 6, General Spears requested that the Soviet Union and China participate in discussions, namely a meeting of the five major powers, but Churchill rejected this, believing that it would take a long time. Churchill also stated in the House of Commons that the United States, Britain, and France should immediately come forward to mediate this conflict. Based on the various disputes caused by the First World War and the recent social problems in the Islamic world, the situation is extremely complex.</p>
<p>San Francisco Conference</p>
<p>On June 6, London's *The Times* published a commentary on the San Francisco Conference from San Francisco, stating that the opinions of the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, France, and China are extremely divided regarding the veto power. Stanley Babson, a special correspondent for Reuters in San Francisco, stated that Truman and Churchill have requested Stalin to reach a compromise. If the opinions of the various countries differ on this issue, and if the disputes over mandated territories are added, the outcome of the San Francisco Conference will inevitably become a soap bubble. Before the closing of the conference, it is filled with all kinds of disputes, which shows that this conference has become a grand opening but a poor closing, and will inevitably end inconclusively. The repeated delays in the return of Harry Hopkins, the American envoy to Moscow, to Washington are undoubtedly greatly related to this.</p>
<p>Kuomintang-Communist Friction</p>
<p>According to a Reuters dispatch from Chongqing on the 6th, Chen Cheng, Minister of War of the Chongqing government, admitted that there have been various frictions between the Chongqing government and the Communist Party in recent months. He also stated that the munitions loaned by the United States have never been used in the war against the Communists. Song Ziwen's visit to Moscow will undoubtedly create more difficulties on this issue. Chen stated that the responsibility for the Kuomintang-Communist friction should be borne by the Communist Party. This issue has been silent for a long time, and now its exposure is nothing more than a promotional stunt. After the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee, the number of standing committee members of the First Executive Committee was increased, with Wu Tiecheng replacing Kong Xiangxi. This represents a gesture of flattery towards the reform faction of nationalism.</p>

<h3>Wuyi Association Organizes Loans for Impoverished Students</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Fellow Association of Natives from Tong, Ju, Chongming, Hai, and Qidong Counties has always strived to serve its fellow villagers. Recently, it completed the Wuyi Cemetery on Zhenjiang Road in western Shanghai, relocating 600 coffins from the guild hall free of charge, which is particularly commendable. Recognizing the current urgent situation, and thanks to the dedicated efforts of several fellow villagers, it has raised two million yuan to provide loans to impoverished students from the five counties studying in Shanghai (limited to secondary school students for the time being). Registration began yesterday and will close on the 16th of this month. Outstanding and impoverished students from the five counties can apply at the association's office at 429 Yanyedasha. Once approved, each will be granted a loan of 30,000 to 100,000 yuan.</p>

Each experiment will be jointly demonstrated by students from the Chemical Industry Research Society of the YMCA, Tongde Medical College, and St. John's Medical College, and will introduce the properties, efficacy, and usage of the medicines produced. Those interested in participating in the experiment can contact the inquiry office of the YMCA directly.</p>

<p>Free Medical Treatment Donated to Impoverished Children: Reader Jin Quanying wrote: "I was able to receive medical treatment at the Red Cross Hospital, and the hospital, in consideration of my status as a medical student, waived 53,000 yuan of fees. However, with gratitude, I felt that I should not accept it, so I donated the waived medical fees to the Xin Puyu Hall (23,000 yuan) and the Shengmu Yuan Nursery (30,000 yuan) to do my part. I hope your newspaper can convey this."</p>
