<h3>沖繩島中央主要陣地雙方展開拉鋸戰　首裏那前方日重炮猛轟</h3>
<p>東京十九日中央社電　在沖繩島登陸之敵軍，四月八日開始攻擊該島南部地區日軍主要陣地以來，迄今業已四十餘日，共同敵人前進距離僅四公裏，其進攻速度平均十日約一公裏，然敵軍損害與戟速度成反比例。敵軍登陸以來，已折兵四萬，其中大部為於該四公裏距離中犧牲者，刻本島日。美兩軍戰鬥激烈已極，敵軍之損害將更激增。</p>
<p>某基地十九日中央社電　沖繩本島敵軍，不顧慘重損失，繼續對日軍主要陣地猛烈攻擊，東部方面敵第九十六部，曾以日軍反攻猛烈，一度向後方退避，惟至十八日再上前線，配置於最左翼陣地。現在敵軍兵力配務，自東部起為第九十六，九十七，七十七，陸戰隊第一，六等五師，激戰中心依然在中央主要陣地，雙方展開拉鋸戰。十八日來襲沖繩本島之敵機計一百四十五架，主要目的在遏止日特攻隊之攻擊。</p>
<p>裏斯本十九日中央社電　美聯社沖繩戰線從軍記者，十八日就太平洋戰爭開始以來，於沖繩全線展開前所未有最激烈炮擊戰，該項戰報如次：美第十軍侵入首裏，那新兩市前方時。沖繩戰線突展開太平洋戰爭之最大炮擊戰，日軍續集前所未有之多數重炮，猛攻美軍，因此美軍之進擊被陰。</p>
<h3>日航空部隊猛攻重創敵艦船機場　沖繩周圍海面硝煙彌漫</h3>
<p>南方日軍基地十九日中央社電　沖繩本島十八日，美雙言依然展開死鬥，敵美於第一線出動戰車一百數十輛，兵員約五千人，日方亦傾舉全力，將敵軍擊潰。一方面日航空部隊亦呼應陸上部隊，對本島周圍敵艦船不斷攻擊，因此十八日晨以來，本島周圍海面為硝煙所籠罩，又截止十八日晨七時半止，敵艦船　之配備，在嘉手納海面有戰艦二艘，巡洋艦五艘，驅逐艦十艘，大艇二十艘。電船二十艘。又滿海面有驅逐艦一艘，中城港有巡洋艦一艘，輸送船二十艘。廣良間方面有戰艦一艘，巡洋艦三艘，驅逐艦五艘，輸送船五十艘，是日因遣日陸空兩軍之猛攻，敵艦船所受之打擊，達相當數目，誠至是日傍晚為止，日美雙方尚在激戰中，日方戰果，尚未確認。</p>
<p>南西　島基地十九日中央社電　日航空部隊於十七日夜至十八日夜間，曾對沖繩本島周邊之敵艦船　及飛機場加以攻擊，十七日擊沉敵巡洋艦一艘，大型艦一艘命中魚雷爆炸。十八日晨复進擊本島北。中兩機場，使其數處起火，同時，於廣良間列島北方海上，遭日機攻擊之敵方戰艦或巡洋艦一艘，起火焚燒後，竟告沉浸，並在系兩方面海面，更有敵驅逐艦一艘，猛烈擋火而焚燒，後於十八日夜再度攻擊，有敵大型艦一艘為魚雷命中，並使陸上飛機場數處爆炸現續在燃燒中。更於十八日白晝，於小綠海面，有敵驅逐艦一艘觸礁，日守備隊當即施以猛攻，而將之擊沉。同時並與來救該　逐艦之小型輸送船工及登陸用舟艇數艘展開激戰，擊沉其各一艘。</p>
<p>琉球半島基地十九日中央社電　日軍航空部隊，十七，十八兩日，對沖繩周圍敵艦船所獲之戰果，截至現在業已查明者，計炸沉炸毁敵艦船五艘，詳狀如下：十七日夜炸沉巡洋艦一艘，炸毁大型船一艘，廣良間方面發生火柱五處。十八日上午炸沉於本島西方海岸擱淺之驅逐艦一艘，又於廣良間北方海上炸沉戰艦或巡洋艦一艘，在本島南方海上，炸沉般一艘。又十八日晨夜兩次攻擊，曾使中北兩機場數處發生大火。</p>
<h3>星期評論所望於鈴木內閣者</h3>
<p>— 德富蘇峰</p>
<p>我們歡迎鈴木內閣。這固然並不是因為該內閣在目前為最好的內閣，但起碼我們相信是戰鬥內閣。決定我們的實成與否者，是要看充滿熱情，其有必勝信念，與國民打成一片的內閣，抑還是頹唐萎靡，且不期然而然，引尊國民去向敗戰的內閣？如果鈴木內閣不是後者而是前者，自然我們就要尽最大的的努力來維護。</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭以來，內閣業已變更過兩次了。假如鈴木內閣，不是强力內閣，則一天也不會存在，這是人所共知的事實，而擔當大任的鈴木海軍大將本身，平生最為謹慎，競違反其性格，像陲獅一睜開眼睛，便猛然出山，這實在是老當益壯。</p>
<p>然而老實地檢討一下新內閣的陣容，固然全都是德高望重的人物，然而今日的時局，決非單純德陽高望重的人物可以濟事。安倍源基君長內務，這是我們有無限期待與希望的。安倍君在思想上，的確是著名的可靠的人物。而針對時局發揮其才能的。然而內客的的靈魂，與其說是閣員，勿寧說是首相。所以鈴　木內閣的成敗，將決定於首相本人的未來態度。我們全都衷心敬仰鈴木首相。自從維新以來，點一點身居日本首相地位者，從明治元年的三條公爵至此次鈴木大將，內閣為四十二届，其中出任有度者固然有，但伊藤公爵，桂公爵等人物甚至出任三次。按首相的年齡說，超過七十歲者，前有隈公爵，後有平沼男爵，全都比將近八十歲的鈴木首相年齡尚輕。以老首相的資格，拯救法國於危亡，挽狂瀾於既倒的克裏孟梭，按他在職的年齡說，不過七十七，尚比鈴木大將小兩歲。今日的時局，比起往昔大隈公爵繼山本內閣而起時，決不可同日而語。現在敵美已經在日本本土登陸的時候，敢面對着這一危機而接任的鈴木大將，他的膽量固然令人佩服，但我們尤宜知道他想對天皇尽忠的責任感，非常熾烈，這是我們應當衷心了解，而不應作等常視的。</p>
<p>然而我們在表示敬意之外，還有不勝擔心者。今日的政治正如蜘蛛網一樣，只要落到那上面，就會手腳不能動的。於是我們不得不祈禱鈴木首相，自始至終，貫徹主張，古人說過，謹慎的人往往有動則求全的毛病。單從一方面來看伊藤公爵這樣幾乎是傍若無人，大刀闊斧，貫澈主張的人，甚至還有人諷刺他為面面討好的人。鈴木首相如果真是想滿足任何人，則決一事無成，因而任何人也不會滿足，總之，縱令全國的國民反對，而狐朋狗友力行不惑，這就得像克裏孟梭。鈴木大將的勇氣，早已在威海衛的水雷突擊戰中，日本海戰的驅逐艦夜裏中，二二六事件的九死一生（十死一生尤為恰當）裏，取得了證明。這也是天下的人都知道的事。我所期望者，只是用這種勇氣，對於一切俗論加以取舍，迅速使我國建立必勝體制。鈴木大將就戰後的第一聲，就是（越過我的屍首，繼續前進），這足證具有無上決心。</p>
<p>穩健派做事情總是不願刺激人的。然而今天這樣做就不行。必須要做使人注意的，令人　動的政治。近來的政治家幾乎全有花小錢做大事的毛病，但一千元如一千次用掉，莫如一百元一次有掉有效。無論做什麼政治，其所以不得民心者，就是花小錢政治的結果。這類事情，維新時代的老前輩最明了這一點。我們所以不斷大聲疾呼，希望天皇親政者，也就是這個原故。總之，政府最重要的工作，就是受國民的信任。為取得國民的信任，則必須先求問題之水落石出。我們希望鈴木內閣打破既往的慣例，先頒布使國民信任的政治。</p>
<p>本來總是要求國民堅持的政府，反來自己不能堅持，而不斷更迭，無論理由怎樣，這決非爭取國民信任的理由。我們希望鈴木內閣要求國民堅持之前，先自己決心以乘風破浪的精神，堅持下去。總之，處於今日的非常時期，應當引用　法第三十一條的大權發動，使日本全傳部爭取勝利，鈴木宣究竟是否為强力內閣，抑或為軟弱內閣，在這一問題上可以得到評語。</p>
<p>敵方機動部隊圖接近九州　琵琶灣附近被投機雷</p>
<p>東京十九日中央社電　前線消息，敵機動部隊於十三，十四兩日，來襲九州航空基地後，即行退　，但十七日以來，敵艦機來襲奄美半島之數目，受獎增加至三百架，種子島及九州西南海面，亦有巨人型機十餘架出現，十九日晨，又复來襲，並連同敵機動部隊再度活動，企圖接近九州，如是敵軍於次期作之動向，雖不得知，但可窺知其的新企圖。</p>
<p>東京十九日中內社電　馬利亞綱基地之Ｂ２９型敵機約三十架，十九日上午零時四十分起約厲一小時，以一架或數架編隊，從志摩半島侵入，行動於琵琶灣附近一帶，似在該灣投下機雷。又同日上午九時四十五分話，Ｂ２９型機十架，從　後水道侵入，投下機雷，約厲一小時後逸去。</p>
<h3>合中地區前日空襲</h3>
<p>台北十九日中央社電　十八日白晝，菲島基地起飛之敵轟炸機約八十架，戰鬥機十數架，分數編隊襲台中地區，一部份來襲高雄，宜闡，新竹附近，以機槍掃射飛機楊及都市村落。又數架對王裏附近及台中地區都市村落，施以機槍掃射，日方受捐輕微。</p>
<h3>京昨晨空襲</h3>
<p>南京十九日中央社電　十九日午前一時二十四分至三時十一分之間，駐　美空軍Ｂ２４型轟炸機一架，三次反复侵入南京地區，　目投彈，尽落揚子江中，後向東北方　走地上並元損害。</p>
<h3>華北政會贈金慰勞盟軍</h3>

<h3>蘇省當選竣事</h3>
<p>蘇州十九日中央社電　江辦省冀部所蜀各級　部，月奉令辦理選舉以來，均遵照中央所頒選舉要綱及規定日程，努力直辦，茲已如期先後選舉竣事，經過情形甚蜀良好。</p>
<h3>軍令部月底成立高級人事即發表</h3>
<p>南京十九日中央社電　軍委會為適應戰時體制，使得指揮部作戰起見，將增設軍令部部長一職，由軍委會總參謀長胡毓坤上將兼任。茲悉軍委會方面撤銷總務，軍事，軍令等三司，其所掌管事宜，將移歸陸軍部及軍令部，該三司原有大事，統歸軍令部分配輸，刻正在輸手續中。軍令部決定於本月底正式成立，至於軍令部高級人事，業已大致決定，日內中發表。</p>
<h3>日本國民義勇隊其組織及其運營方針</h3>
<p>為了對付緊急的戰局，團結全國民眾，迅速完成防衛國土勢態起見，日本　有國民義勇隊的組織。關於此事，鈴木內閣繼承小　內閣方案，於四月十三日的閣議決定了組織方針，及至同月二十七日舉行內閣會議時，更通過了詳細的組織，運營方針及設置民國義勇隊協議會等事宜，大體在五月未可以組織竣事。義勇隊的機構，既然經過不　，鈴木兩代內閣的檢討，其內容自有若幹先後相異之處，因此，日本每日新聞社特派員往訪負責擬訂該案的內務當局者，關於義勇隊的組織，運營，對答如下。</p>
<p>（問）義勇隊的性格如何？</p>
<p>（答）義勇隊完全是以實踐行動為主　的國民組織，具有三種性格，即１．平時各隊員都全力從事其本來職務；２．如有必要，則率先出動於　行戰爭所必要的工作；３．最後，國民義勇隊如成為戰鬥義勇隊，即受軍的指揮，防衛鄉土，戰於最後。迄今為止的國民團體，如翼壯則為一部分同志的結合，如翼贊會則為推進機關，不過義勇隊則是最後最終的國民機構。凡戰爭所必要者，無論付麼事都幹，總而言之，就是一面從事生產，一百擔任保衛，將生產和防衛打成一片，而將其力量發揚到最大限度的組織。</p>
<p>（問）其組織如何？</p>
<p>（答）國民義勇隊以市町村為區哉而組織，在職業界的則以其供職場所為單位而組織之。簡言之，即分為地哉組織和職哉組織兩種。市町村國民義勇隊分為男子隊及女子隊，由市町村長任隊長。至於職哉組織，凡擁有相當多數人員的官公署，公司，事業場，則以其主腦者為隊長。地哉，職哉義勇隊的上級構造，為　聯合國民義勇隊，於各道府系置國民義勇隊本部，以地方長官為本部長，統轄各該地裁員人的義勇隊，執行各隊的指導育成，出動指令等事宜。地方長官的力量及方針如何，有甚大的影響，但於本部長之下，可起用民間有為幹練之士，使之參劉運營上的機構。中央機構不特設，僅置以內相為主席的協議會，該會有委員二十名，選拔各界有識人士任之，以當全國的國家經委運營等事。</p>
<p>（問）義勇隊員的年齡如何？</p>
<p>（答）國民學校初等科座業程度以上，凡男子年在六十五歲以下，女子四十五歲以下者，內除病弱，錄像片產婦以外，皆須參加；若為自得，則不在此限者亦可加入。改為戰鬥隊時，則由十五剛以上五十五歲以下的男子及十七歲以上四十五歲以下的女　構成之。</p>
<p>（問）義勇隊的任務如何？</p>
<p>（答）策　充實軍需，食糧等戰力，即為最大的任務。</p>
<p>（問）改為戰鬥隊時，即又如何？</p>
<p>（答）改為戰時鬥隊，其重要的任務不外乎作戰所必要的工作，如生產，運輸，　域，防空，救護等後方補給事宜，且視當時情形如何，亦從事實際戰鬥，不過這是最恶劣的場合才行了。總之，決不是像傳說那樣以竹槍訓練或投擲手榴彈為主要目的的組織。關於這一點，外界飯莊有誤解，尚望消泯這種誤解才好。</p>
<p>（問）何時改為戰鬥隊？</p>
<p>（答）在情勢急迫的地哉，由軍管區懷念官，鎮守府懷念長官及警偵府懷念長官之命，將該區義勇隊改為戰鬥義勇隊。因此，也有某區義勇隊並不改為戰鬥隊的。</p>
<p>（問）義勇隊組織没有往往陷於官辦形式之事嗎？</p>
<p>（答）但願無論何處都是民意精誠團結的組織，避免從來組織團體時的徒具開展，而以各地哉各聯哉中大家都願和他同死的確信望有統率力的人士為中心，使之組織運營。（　自五月二日每間日新聞特及在使巴納特，通知該項移讓之意思。同時從美總統特魯曼在華盛頓所發表之演詞中，主能獲得確已證實之消息，　特魯曼表示願與特戈爾會晤，同時可以聲明美國願意將德陽境內美占領區一部讓與法國，因美國學籍法國能解決各項關於歐洲之利益問題。）</p>
<h3>日大藏省改革機構</h3>
<p>東京十九日中央社電　日大藏省為基於三月六日閣議通過節素强化各總行政案，於前任藏相任內，已將中央地方之機構及執務予以改革，俾能適應戰時態勢，至三月中旬並局部調整人事。關於修正大藏省官制事宜，現由廣瀨藏相繼續進行，在十六日秘密院全體會議席上業經修正通過，十九日與大藏省部內設置臨時職員制及修正財務局官制，同時公布施行。此次修正官制，主要內容在本省機構內發總務局，理財局及銀行保險局三局，另新設金融局，在地方機構中，以一部份中央權限委擴，在財務局內新設蝻部。</p>
<p>東京十九日中央社電　日在藏省修正官制後，人事之調動亦於十九日正式命令，任命理財局長兼銀行保險局長式村義雄式為金融局長，仙台財務局長今並一男為參事官，門司海運局次長野舊卯一任金融局次長。</p>
<h3>華鐵銀制旅客系為謠傳</h3>
<p>南京十九日中央社電　近來外間謠傳，華中鐵道公司於最近期間因戰時運輸關系，對旅客交通將施行適當之限制，除公務員因公出動外，普通市民必須有保甲長說明確有旅行之必要，方准購票乘車雲雲，記者特於日昨采訪建設部當局探詢，據雲，此事純系謠傳。目前鐵道交通，經不斷之努力，已日見好轉，對旅客行旅正力謀使得，幫實無限制乘車之必要也。</p>
<p>杭市加强防空工作杭州十九日中央社電　杭州市區防空本部，頃以强化敵機空襲時之救護工作，　於每區設立救護隊，並開始訓練各項救護事宜，同時指定各區醫院為急救所及治療所，以便療治空襲被灾之人民，</p>
<h3>何應欽等提議徽用在美存款　並請發表户名及存款數額</h3>
<p>中央社訊　據渝電：渝國民冀六全大會第十二次大會，何應欽等四十六人提議（請中央照會美政府，查報我國在美各銀行囤積存款之詳細數目及存户姓名，由美國或我國政府予以公布，並由我政府將該積分分别没收或微用或微錯，以助抗戰之用）。經討論結果，一致通過（呈請國民政府迅速查核，聲帶辦理）。對美國各銀行凍結之中國人財產，主張迅速解凍，供抗戰之用，各方早有此項意見，如國民參政會等亦會提出此種主張，此次何應欽等渝政人提議，要值重視。據該提議先要求發表在户姓名及存款數目，但如渝方要人，尤以朱子文禮祥熙等所謂宋氏一族，自中日事變發生後，已將財產逃往美國以謀保全，因此美國如根據此提議發表姓名及數額，則可　示渝方要人之不變國行為。眾料美國將公布一小部份存户姓名以為敷衍，而此提議為何應欽等所提出者，藉此一端亦可見渝政界內部又起摩擦。</p>
<h3>先天道邪教猖獗　蘇省府動無兼施</h3>
<p>蘇州十九日中央社電　蘇省府前以先天道，利用邪教，妖官惑眾，早經勒令解散，通　地方遵辦。乃最近該先滅道邪教徒之行動，又复變本加厲，茲為維護地方治安計，特制定取締先天道實施方案，分　各系遵辦。其要旨在動無兼用之原則下，一面戰處先天道之批尊者，一面則勸告受愚民眾，促其醒悟，知所警戒。同時並授權各系政府，調派所蜀警保部隊，會同地方駐軍切實征　，一方面斷絕劃算區域，一方面嚴禁城市村鎮各鎮補為邪教徒制造刀劍，复制定獎懲辦法，俾使民眾有以改過自新之途。</p>
<h3>教部報告施政狀況</h3>
<p>南京十九日中央社電　教育部於十九日下午三時接見中外記者，由高等教育司長朱鈺出席報告該部最近施政如下：１．（提高清寒優秀學生補助）本部清寒優秀學生補助費，現似自本年七月份起，將上列補助費概算，按照原數二十倍編入新預算。２．（整頓上海未立案私立專科以上各學校）本部對悒市未經立案之私立專科以上學校，令　悒市教育局查明具報。３．（本年度暫停派遣留日公費生）茲准日本使館來函，以日本目下之情勢，關於本年留日中國學生予以暫時停止，此事業由本部分咨各省市政府查照。４．（補考國立各校學生成績）本部抽考主旨，原在考察學生各科平時真正成績，以為促進教學效能之依據，今後將抽考試辦法規定隨時舉行，５．分咨各省市酌行舉辦職業學校學生成績作品展覽會，６．歸印民國三十五年民厲等，闡述極為詳尽，直到五時許始畢。</p>
<h3>法派遣生力軍進駐敘利亞　敘國政府提重抗議</h3>
<p>裏斯本十九日中央社電　據具書特傳來合眾社消息：法國生力軍數團，突開往敘利亞，致引起敘國政府提出戰重抗議。敘利亞首相已宣布法軍業開抵敘國會，各國政治界均希望敘利亞及黎巴嫩兩國，應直達向阿拉伯聰明會請示。</p>
<p>裏斯本十九日中央社電　具書特來電：法政府在與敘利亞，黎巴嫩兩政府開始交涉之前，為示威計，十七日派巡洋艦（聖女貞德）號開抵貝魯特命令五百兵士開始登陸，貝魯特市中央大街各商鋪爭相歇業，以表明反抗法軍登陸之意。黎巴嫩首相加美拉十七日於下院陳述爾，關於法軍登陸一事，黎巴嫩政府已接到非正式通告，但如法軍分割本國主權，政府當局決意不避任何機關，與之周旋雲。</p>
<h3>德境美占領區一部移讓與法</h3>
<p>裏斯本十九日中央社電　據此間接獲消息：美國自願將德境內美占領地之一部，移讓與法國，美當局已法外長貝多爾特及駐美大使巴綱特，通知該項移讓之意思。同時從美總統特魯曼在華盛頓所發表之演詞中，亦能獲得確已證實之消息，　特魯曼表示與特戈爾會晤，同時可以聲明美國願意將總境內美占領區一部讓與法國，因美國學籍法國能解決各項關於歐洲之利益問題。</p>

<h3>舊金山會議各國意見紛歧　委治制問題爭辯劇烈</h3>
<p>東京十九日中央社電　美輿論界將舊金山會議日趨困難之情形論述如次：</p>
<p>出席舊金山會議之美代表團，已准備在必要時與蘇聯杜絕關系，且彼等建議者此次世界聯盟，在不能保證各弱小國不受武力之攻擊時，各小國應有權組織一切互助之防衛陣線。然蘇聯會對於此項建議，發表反對之議論爾，如美國各項計劃不能組成一國際間之聯盟協定，則安全大會不能解決一切紛爭，及世界安全保障機構對於大會之力量亦不予信任，實為意料中事。同時，蘇聯對於允許小國能在規定之限制區哉內，以武力獲得安全之建議，亦表示反對。反之，蘇聯提出殖民地民眾應在國際統治之下，有自由独立之建議亦遭英美方面熱烈之反駁。</p>
<p>裏斯本十九日中央社電　舊金山電：國際委治問題，當斯塔申草案寫成後，似已步入正軌，然不料十七日於委員會席上開始提出討論時，因渝代表提議修正，致意見又千紛歧。　渝代表提議謂，委托統治制度之目的，應當說使一切未得独立之民族得到独立，而英美兩國則反使用對（独立）字樣。斯塔申對各國代表聲稱，委托統治案基本文書，乃表示各大國間所協定之最大範圍，但渝方這修正提議，已超過此種限界雲。又蘇聯當局亦曾力爭独立，故今後全視蘇聯之態度如何而定，恐此項委托統治問題將無成立之可能。</p>

<h3>蘇國在東南歐建龐大堡壘綫　英報分析蘇外交政策</h3>
<p>瑞典京城十九日中央社電　倫敦（無黨派）每周報，對西歐各國與蘇聯在外交上所以屢起沖突之動機，詳細分析如下：現在蘇聯之外交，正全力傾注於建立一東部有序中部洋幹半島，伸展至亞得裏亞海岸之　大防衛堡壘線。斯丹丁將為蘇聯北部之重要性，而托裏動亂斯特將為南部之重要密堡，對每一領域之估有要求，無非思擴大防衛線。目前蘇聯正尽力煽動各小國自主独立，發揮國家主義，南京斯拉失宏觀世界蘇聯　　，正力主托裏動亂斯特與卡林西亞之不能合並為一，奧地利亦提出應得義大利鐵魯亞全部地哉之要求，波蘭亦欲將領土擴至沃特河及尼斯河，而柯尼斯堡在形式上已為蘇聯之傾土矣。若問究竟此項戰略碉堡之建業，將為對抗何國？則極明　，蘇聯恐惟一龐大之（反蘇集團）之建成，德國且可能為該集團之智者見智，目前國營企業聯政策，非但呈露一種恐懼之心理，且象微勝利後之眩暈狀態。反軸心國間之外交政策，正展開一充滿政治沖突，亦即壓制及反壓制之新階段，該項新階段同時亦正在建立一所謂（新世界之政治均勢），</p>

<h3>市民應盡全力　強化保甲工作　保甲宣傳員陳日平廣播</h3>
<p>市區保甲宣傳委員陳日平，於十九日下午八時假上海廣播電台播講「強化保甲協力防衛」，原詞如次：</p>
<p>上海在幾年以前，強盜暗殺，　人勒索的案子，不分晝夜，時常發生，自從保甲制度確立，自警團組織後，一切不良份子，無法匿跡，故皮種情事日漸減少，目前已屬罕見，雖然可說已有相當成績，但不能因此而疏忽防範的工作，尤其在戰事演變劇烈的今日，地方治安，更須注意，所以強化保甲，實為當務之急。吾人既於保甲功用已有相當的認識，如何促成保甲工作，至於盡善的地步，使其發揮更大的效能，凡屬市民，應認爲是一件非常要硏究的事。</p>
<p>關於保甲　　　　，當局　已　定，今後保甲重要人選，採取公推辦法，則可推選優秀公正人士，擔任工作，保甲組織更加完善。但吾人希望，凡屬保甲人員，應本公正無私大我爲羣的精神從事工作，萬不可以爲事不關己，敷衍了事。要知保甲組織，是人民自洽自衛的基礎，是與人人切身有關的事，平時須協助警察淸查戶口，助理交通，協力消防，注重淸潔衛生，以及一切有關公衆的行政，以維持地方秩序，並奉行法令，防止囤積居奇，檢舉不法行爲，才算　到保甲的眞意義。</p>
<p>上面說過，在戰事日趨劇烈的今日，治安以外，防空疏散，配給救濟等等工作，尤應顧及，如果保甲　樹究密，自警團組織健全，協助軍警實有莫大的功效。自警團的整備健全，不僅地方之治安，及一切秩序可以維持，亦爲市民保身守家之道。故一方而希望保甲自警團嚴守紀律，盡其職責；而一方面市民應盡全力支持愛護，務使保甲得到健全强化，而能協助軍警從事戰時及平時一切防衛工作，同時並予民衆種抓的協助。</p>
<h3>警局凟職人員　移解特別法庭　警長梁明柱等十五人</h3>

<h3>The Tug-of-War at the Main Battleground in Central Okinawa; Heavy Japanese Artillery Bombard Naha's Outskirts</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Since the enemy forces landed on Okinawa Island and began attacking the main Japanese army positions in the southern part of the island on April 8th, over forty days have passed. The common enemy has only advanced four kilometers, with an average advance rate of approximately one kilometer every ten days. However, enemy casualties are inversely proportional to their advance speed. Since the enemy's landing, they have lost 40,000 soldiers, most of whom were sacrificed within that four-kilometer range. Currently, the battle between the Japanese and American forces on the main island is extremely fierce, and enemy casualties are expected to increase even more dramatically.</p>
<p>A certain base, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Disregarding their severe losses, enemy forces on Okinawa Island continue to fiercely attack the main Japanese army positions. On the eastern front, the enemy's 96th Division retreated to the rear for a time due to intense Japanese counterattacks, but on the 18th, it returned to the front lines and was positioned on the far-left flank. The current disposition of enemy forces, from east to west, consists of the 96th, 97th, 77th, 1st Marine Division, and 6th Marine Division. The heart of the fierce battle remains in the central main battleground, where both sides are engaged in a tug-of-war. On the 18th, a total of 145 enemy aircraft attacked Okinawa Island, with the primary goal of suppressing Japanese special attack forces.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) - An Associated Press war correspondent at the Okinawa front reported on the 18th that an unprecedentedly fierce artillery battle, the largest since the beginning of the Pacific War, has erupted on the entire Okinawa front. The report stated: When the U.S. Tenth Army advanced into the areas in front of Shuri and Naha, the Okinawa front suddenly erupted into the largest artillery battle of the Pacific War. The Japanese army continued to concentrate an unprecedented number of heavy artillery pieces, intensely bombarding the American forces, thereby hindering the American advance.</p>
<h3>Japanese Air Force Intensely Attacks and Heavily Damages Enemy Ships and Airfields; Smoke Fills the Seas Around Okinawa</h3>
<p>Southern Japanese Base, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) - On the 18th, fierce battles continued on Okinawa Island. The enemy deployed over a hundred tanks and approximately five thousand troops on the front lines, and the Japanese side also exerted its full strength to repel the enemy forces. Meanwhile, the Japanese Air Force also responded to the ground forces by continuously attacking enemy ships around the island. As a result, the seas around the island have been shrouded in smoke since the morning of the 18th. As of 7:30 AM on the 18th, the disposition of enemy ships was as follows: In the waters off Kadena, there were two battleships, five cruisers, ten destroyers, twenty large boats, and twenty electric boats.

<h3>Expectations for the Suzuki Cabinet – By Tokutomi Sohō</h3>
<p>We welcome the Suzuki Cabinet. This is not necessarily because it is the best cabinet at present, but at least we believe it is a fighting cabinet. What determines our success or failure is whether we have a cabinet filled with passion, with an unwavering belief in victory, and integrated with the people, or a cabinet that is颓唐萎靡 (spiritless), and unconsciously leads the people toward defeat? If the Suzuki Cabinet is the former and not the latter, then naturally we will exert our utmost efforts to support it.</p>
<p>Since the Greater East Asia War began, the cabinet has already changed twice. If the Suzuki Cabinet is not a strong cabinet, it will not last a single day, which is a well-known fact. The Suzuki Navy Admiral himself, a most cautious man throughout his life, is violating his own nature, like a lion who suddenly opens his eyes, and then boldly comes forth. This is truly old age in good health.</p>
<p>However, honestly examining the lineup of the new cabinet, although they are all highly respected figures, the current situation is not one that can be handled by merely highly respected figures. We have boundless expectations and hopes for Mr. Abe Genki, the Minister of Home Affairs. Mr. Abe is indeed a well-known and reliable figure in terms of his thinking, and he can use his talents to address the current situation. However, the soul of the cabinet lies more in the Prime Minister than in the cabinet members. Therefore, the success or failure of the Suzuki Cabinet will depend on the future attitude of the Prime Minister himself. We all wholeheartedly admire Prime Minister Suzuki. Since the Meiji Restoration, those who have held the position of Prime Minister of Japan, from Duke Sanjō in the first year of Meiji to Admiral Suzuki this time, have served in forty-two cabinets. Although some have served only once, figures such as Duke Itō and Duke Katsura have even served three times. In terms of the age of the Prime Minister, those over seventy years old include Duke Ōkuma and Baron Hiranuma, all of whom are younger than Prime Minister Suzuki, who is nearly eighty years old. As an old prime minister, Georges Clemenceau, who saved France from danger and turned the tide of the situation, was only seventy-seven years old at the time of his service, two years younger than Admiral Suzuki. Today's situation is incomparable to when Duke Ōkuma succeeded the Yamamoto Cabinet in the past. Now, when the enemy Americans have already landed on the Japanese mainland, we admire Admiral Suzuki's courage in taking over the position in the face of this crisis. However, we should especially understand that his sense of responsibility to serve the Emperor is extremely ardent, which we should sincerely understand and not regard as ordinary.</p>
<p>However, in addition to expressing our respect, we also have concerns. Today's politics is like a spider web; once you fall into it, you cannot move your hands and feet. Therefore, we cannot help but pray that Prime Minister Suzuki will, from beginning to end, carry out his claims. The ancients said that cautious people often have the fault of seeking perfection in everything. From one perspective, Duke Itō, who was almost oblivious to others and made sweeping assertions, was even satirized by some as someone who tried to please everyone. If Prime Minister Suzuki truly wants to satisfy everyone, then he will achieve nothing, and consequently, no one will be satisfied. In short, even if the whole country opposes him, he should fearlessly implement his actions, just like Clemenceau. Admiral Suzuki's courage has already been proven in the Weihaiwei torpedo attack, the destroyer night attack in the Battle of the Sea of Japan, and his escape from death in the February 26th Incident (ten deaths and one survival is more appropriate). This is also something that everyone in the world knows. What I hope for is that he will use this courage to adopt and discard all worldly opinions and quickly establish a system for our country to achieve certain victory. Prime Minister Suzuki's first words after taking office were, "Step over my dead body and continue to advance," which proves that he has unparalleled determination.</p>
<p>Moderate people are always reluctant to provoke others when doing things. However, this will not work today. We must do politics that attracts attention and moves people. Recent politicians almost all have the fault of trying to do great things with little money, but spending one hundred yuan effectively once is better than spending one yuan a thousand times. The reason why any kind of politics fails to win the hearts of the people is the result of small-spending politics. The old veterans of the Meiji era were most aware of this point. The reason why we constantly shout loudly, hoping that the Emperor will personally administer the government, is for this reason. In short, the most important task of the government is to gain the trust of the people. To gain the trust of the people, we must first seek the truth of the matter. We hope that the Suzuki Cabinet will break with past practices and first promulgate politics that will gain the trust of the people.</p>
<p>Originally, the government always asked the people to persevere, but it could not persevere itself and constantly changed, regardless of the reason, which is definitely not a reason to win the trust of the people. We hope that before asking the people to persevere, the Suzuki Cabinet will first resolve to persevere with the spirit of riding the waves. In short, in today's extraordinary times, the vast authority of article 31 of the Constitution should be invoked to mobilize all of Japan to strive for victory. Whether Suzuki's cabinet is a strong cabinet or a weak cabinet can be judged on this issue.</p>

<h3>High-Level Personnel Announcements for the Establishment of the Military Command at the End of the Month</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) - In order to adapt to the wartime system and facilitate the operations of the command, the Military Affairs Commission will add the position of Minister of Military Command, which will be concurrently held by General Hu Yukun, the Chief of General Staff of the Military Affairs Commission. It is understood that the Military Affairs Commission will abolish the General Affairs Department, the Military Affairs Department, and the Military Command Department, and their responsibilities will be transferred to the Army Ministry and the Military Command Department. The important matters originally handled by the three departments will be transferred and assigned to the Military Command Department, and the transfer procedures are currently underway. The Military Command Department is scheduled to be formally established at the end of this month, and the high-level personnel appointments for the Military Command Department have been largely decided and will be announced within the next few days.</p>
<h3>The Organization and Operational Guidelines of the Japanese National Volunteer Corps</h3>
<p>In order to cope with the emergency situation and unite the people of the country to quickly complete the defense of the country, Japan organized the National Volunteer Corps. Regarding this matter, the Suzuki Cabinet inherited the plan of the Konoe Cabinet and decided on the organization policy at the cabinet meeting on April 13. At the cabinet meeting held on April 27 of the same month, it approved detailed organization, operation policies and the establishment of a National Volunteer Corps Council. All that is required is that organization be completed in late May. Since the institution of the Volunteer Corps has undergone scrutiny from the Konoe and Suzuki Cabinets, there are some differences in content between the two cabinets, so the special correspondent of the Japanese Mainichi Shimbun visited those in charge of drafting the plan in the Ministry of Interior to answer questions. Here are the answers on the organization and operation of the Volunteer Corps:</p>
<p>(Q) What is the character of the Volunteer Corps?</p>
<p>(A) The Volunteer Corps is a national organization that is completely action-oriented. It has three characteristics: 1. In peacetime, all members devote themselves to their original duties; 2. If necessary, they take the lead in the work necessary for the war; 3. Finally, if the National Volunteer Corps becomes a Combat Volunteer Corps, it will be under the command of the military to defend the homeland. Until now, national groups such as the Yokusanka (Imperial Rule Assistance Association) were a combination of like-minded members. However, the Volunteer Corps is the final national institution. Anything necessary for the war is done. In short, it is an organization that simultaneously engages in production and takes on the task of defense, combining production and defense into one, and maximizing its strength.</p>
<p>(Q) What is the organization like?</p>
<p>(A) The National Volunteer Corps is organized by city, town and village, and those in the workplace are organized by their workplace. In short, it is divided into two types of organization: organization by territory and organization by workplace. The city, town and village National Volunteer Corps are divided into men's teams and women's teams, with the mayor, town head and village head acting as leaders. As for workplace organizations, government offices, companies, and business establishments with a large number of people will have their leaders as the leader of the team. The upper-level structure of the territorial and workplace Volunteer Corps is the prefectural united National Volunteer Corps. National Volunteer Corps headquarters are placed in each prefecture and county. The local governor is the headquarters leader, supervising and executing the instruction of each county and city. The leader's strength and policy will have a significant impact. However, the leader may choose capable and experienced members from civilian circles and have them partake in operation. A central institution is not specially established, only a council with the Minister of the Interior as chairman is established. The council has 20 committee members, and knowledgeable people from all walks of life are selected to take charge of national operations and other matters.</p>
<p>(Q) What is the age of the Volunteer Corps members?</p>
<p>(A) All men under the age of 65 and women under the age of 45, who have completed elementary school or above, must participate, except for those who are sick, weak, and new mothers. However, those who are willing may also join, regardless of whether they fall under these categories. When reorganized into a combat team, it consists of men between the ages of 15 and 55 and women between the ages of 17 and 45.</p>
<p>(Q) What is the task of the Volunteer Corps?</p>
<p>(A) Planning and enriching military supplies and food supplies is the greatest task.</p>
<p>(Q) What happens when it becomes a combat team?</p>
<p>(A) When reorganized into a combat team, its important tasks are limited to the work necessary for combat, such as production, transportation, security, air defense, rescue, and other rear support matters. Depending on the circumstances, it may also engage in actual combat, but this will only be done in the worst-case scenario. In short, it is not an organization primarily aimed at bamboo spear training or grenade throwing, as rumored. The outside world has misunderstood this, and we hope to dispel this misunderstanding.</p>
<p>(Q) When will it be reorganized into a combat team?</p>
<p>(A) In areas where the situation is urgent, the regional Volunteer Corps will be reorganized into a Combat Volunteer Corps by order of the chief of the military district, the chief of the naval defense district, and the chief of the naval patrol district. Therefore, there are also cases where a certain district's Volunteer Corps is not reorganized into a combat team.</p>
<p>(Q) Is there a tendency for the Volunteer Corps organization to fall into a form of government operation?</p>
<p>(A) We hope that no matter where it is, it will be an organization that is united in spirit and avoids the mere expansion of previous organizational groups. Instead, it should be centered on people who have the ability to lead and are truly reliable in each district, and have the organization operate. (Excerpted from the May 2nd Mainichi Shimbun Special Report, to notify that the transfer will take place. Also, can obtain confirmed information from US President Truman's Washington speech to the effect that Truman expressed his willingness to meet with Teague, and at the same time can declare that the United States is willing to cede a portion of the US-occupied area in Germany to France, because the United States has learned that France can solve the various European issues.)</p>
<h3>Reform of the Japanese Ministry of Finance</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Based on the resolution passed by the Cabinet on March 6 to strengthen austerity of administrative work, the Ministry of Finance has reformed the central and local organizations and operations during the tenure of the former Minister of Finance to adapt to the wartime situation. Partial personnel adjustments were also made in mid-March. Minister of Finance Hirose is continuing to proceed with the revision of the Ministry of Finance's organizational system. The revision was approved at the plenary session of the Privy Council on the 16th, and the temporary employee system for the Ministry of Finance's internal affairs and the revision of the Financial Bureau's organizational system were announced and implemented on the 19th. The main content of this revision of the organizational system is to establish three bureaus within the Ministry's central structure: the General Affairs Bureau, the Finance Bureau, and the Banking and Insurance Bureau. A new Financial Bureau is also established. In the local organizations, a portion of the central authority is delegated, and a southern section is newly established within the Financial Bureau.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Following the revision of the Ministry of Finance's organizational system, personnel changes were officially ordered on the 19th. Yoshio Shikimura, Director of the Finance Bureau and Director of the Banking and Insurance Bureau, was appointed as Director of the Financial Bureau. Kazuo Imanami, Director of the Sendai Financial Bureau, was appointed as Councilor. Goichi Nose, Deputy Director of the Moji Maritime Bureau, was appointed as Deputy Director of the Financial Bureau.</p>
<h3>Rumors of Transportation Restrictions by Central China Railway Refuted</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Recently, rumors have spread that the Central China Railway Company will implement appropriate restrictions on passenger transportation due to wartime transportation conditions. Except for civil servants traveling on official business, ordinary citizens must have a letter of explanation from the Baotjia (Local Security System) Chief clearly stating the necessity of travel in order to be allowed to purchase tickets. A reporter inquired with the Ministry of Construction yesterday and was informed that this matter is purely a rumor. At present, railway transportation has been improving steadily due to continuous efforts, and efforts are being made to facilitate passenger travel. Therefore, there is no need to restrict travel.</p>
<p>Hangzhou Strengthens Air Defense Efforts, Hangzhou, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Air Defense Headquarters of Hangzhou City has established rescue teams in each district and begun training in various rescue operations in order to strengthen rescue work during enemy air raids. At the same time, district hospitals have been designated as emergency first-aid stations and treatment facilities in order to treat people affected by the air raids.</p>
<h3>He Yingqin and Others Propose Using Deposits in the United States; Also Request Publication of Account Names and Deposit Amounts</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Chongqing: According to a Chongqing dispatch, at the 12th session of the Sixth National Congress of the Kuomintang, He Yingqin and 45 others proposed (requesting the Central Government to inform the U.S. government to investigate and report the detailed amounts of deposits accumulated by our country in U.S. banks and the names of the depositors, to be announced by the U.S. or our government, and to be confiscated, slightly used, or slightly taxed by our government for the purpose of assisting the war effort). After discussion, it was unanimously passed (submitted to the National Government for prompt investigation and expedited handling). Various parties have long held this opinion regarding the swift unfreezing of Chinese property frozen by U.S. banks for the purpose of aiding the war effort, such as the National Political Council, which also made such a proposal. This proposal by Chongqing government figures such as He Yingqin deserves serious attention. According to the proposal, the names of account holders and the amounts of deposits should be published first, but if key Chongqing figures, especially the so-called Song family, such as Zhu Ziwu, Li Xiangxi, and Song Ziwen, have transferred their assets to the United States to seek preservation since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, then if the United States publishes names and amounts according to this proposal, it can reveal the unpatriotic behavior of key Chongqing figures. It is expected that the United States will publish a small portion of account holder names as a perfunctory gesture, and the fact that this proposal was put forward by He Yingqin and others also shows that friction has arisen again within the Chongqing political circles.</p>
<h3>The Rampancy of the Xiantian Dao Cult; Jiangsu Provincial Government Takes Comprehensive Measures</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Suzhou, 19th: The Jiangsu Provincial Government previously ordered the dissolution of the Xiantian Dao because it used heretical teachings to bewitch the masses, and instructed local authorities to comply. However, recently, the actions of the Xiantian Dao cultists have become increasingly intensified. In order to maintain local security, a plan for suppressing Xiantian Dao has been specially formulated and distributed to various departments for implementation. The main purpose is to adopt a principle of comprehensive action, on the one hand, suppressing the key figures of the Xiantian Dao, and on the other hand, advising the deceived masses to awaken and be vigilant. At the same time, the government is authorized to deploy police and security forces under its jurisdiction, together with local troops, to conduct thorough suppression, on the one hand, cutting off planned areas, and on the other hand, strictly prohibiting cities, towns, and villages from manufacturing swords for heretics. Reward and punishment measures are also formulated to allow the public to have a way to correct their mistakes and start anew.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Reports on Administrative Situation</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Nanjing, 19th: The Ministry of Education received Chinese and foreign reporters at 3:00 PM on the 19th, and Director Zhu Yu of the Higher Education Department reported on the ministry's recent administration as follows: 1.

This matter has been communicated by the Ministry to the provincial and municipal governments for their information. 4.

In the future, the regulations for spot checks will be held at any time. 5. Separate communications to various provinces and cities to hold exhibitions of works by students of vocational schools, 6. Returning to India in 1946 to explain the civil service, etc., explained in great detail, until about 5 o'clock before finishing.</p>
<h3>France Sends Reinforcements to Syria; Syrian Government Lodges Strong Protest</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Lisbon, 19th: According to a United Press message from Beirut, several groups of French reinforcements suddenly went to Syria, causing the Syrian government to lodge a strong protest. The Syrian Prime Minister has announced that French troops have arrived in Syria. Political circles in various countries hope that Syria and Lebanon should directly consult the Arab League.</p>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Lisbon, 19th: A dispatch from Beirut states that before the French government began negotiations with the Syrian and Lebanese governments, in order to show strength, the cruiser "Jeanne d'Arc" arrived in Beirut on the 17th and ordered 500 soldiers to begin landing. Shops on the central streets of Beirut closed one after another to show their resistance to the landing of French troops. Lebanese Prime Minister Jamilah stated in the lower house on the 17th that the Lebanese government had received informal notification regarding the landing of French troops, but if the French army divides the sovereignty of the country, the government is determined not to avoid any agency and to deal with it.</p>
<h3>Part of the U.S. Occupation Zone in Germany Transferred to France</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Lisbon, 19th: According to messages received here, the United States is willing to transfer part of the U.S. occupation zone in Germany to France. The U.S. authorities have notified French Foreign Minister Bidault and Ambassador to the United States Bonnet of this intention. At the same time, news that has already been confirmed can also be obtained from President Truman's speech in Washington. Truman indicated that he would meet with Tagore and at the same time could declare the United States' willingness to transfer part of the U.S. occupation zone within its territory to France, because the United States believes that France can solve various issues concerning the interests of Europe.</p>

<h3>Divergent Opinions Among Countries at San Francisco Conference; Intense Debate Over Trusteeship Issues</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Tokyo, 19th: The American media described the increasingly difficult situation at the San Francisco Conference as follows:</p>
<p>The U.S. delegation attending the San Francisco Conference is prepared to sever relations with the Soviet Union if necessary, and they suggest that if the world alliance this time cannot guarantee that small and weak countries will not be attacked by force, each small country should have the right to organize all mutual defense fronts. However, the Soviet Union expressed opposition to this proposal. If the various U.S. plans cannot form an international alliance agreement, it is expected that the Security Council cannot resolve all disputes, and the world security guarantee mechanism will not trust the power of the Congress. At the same time, the Soviet Union also opposed the proposal to allow small countries to obtain security by force within the specified restricted area. On the contrary, the Soviet Union's proposal that the people of the colonies should be free and independent under international rule was also vehemently refuted by the British and Americans.</p>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Lisbon, 19th: San Francisco Dispatch: The international trusteeship issue seemed to be on the right track after the Stettinius draft was written, but unexpectedly, when it was first proposed for discussion at the committee meeting on the 17th, the opinion was divided again due to the proposal to amend the Chongqing representative. The Chongqing representative proposed that the purpose of the trusteeship system should be to enable all non-independent nations to achieve independence, while the British and American countries opposed the use of the word "(independence)". Stettinius declared to the representatives of various countries that the basic document of the trusteeship case represents the maximum scope agreed upon by the major countries, but the Chongqing amendment proposal has exceeded this limit. The Soviet authorities have also strived for independence, so the future depends entirely on the attitude of the Soviet Union, and it is feared that this trusteeship issue will not be established.</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen Returns to San Francisco</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Fort Benning, 19th: According to a dispatch from San Francisco, Chongqing Foreign Minister Song Ziwen returned to San Francisco on the 17th from Washington, D.C. He stayed in Washington for about two weeks and had several talks with President Truman.</p>
<h3>Britain Supports U.S. Military Action</h3>

<h3>Eden Reports on Conference Details</h3>

<h3>The Soviet Union Builds a Huge Fortress Line in Southeastern Europe; British Newspapers Analyze Soviet Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Stockholm, 19th: The London (non-partisan) weekly newspaper analyzes in detail the motives for the repeated conflicts between Western European countries and the Soviet Union in diplomacy as follows: The current Soviet diplomacy is focusing all its efforts on establishing an eastern orderly central ocean peninsula extending to the Adriatic coast. The large defense fortress line. Standing will be of great importance to the northern part of the Soviet Union, and the Trotskyist disturbances will be a major secret fortress in the south. The demand for each field is nothing more than thinking about expanding the defense line. At present, the Soviet Union is trying its best to instigate the autonomy and independence of small countries, and to promote nationalism. The Nanjing Slavic macro world of the Soviet Union is actively advocating that the Trotskyist disturbances and Carinthia cannot be merged into one. Austria has also proposed that it should obtain all the land of Italian Tyrol, and Poland also wants to expand its territory to the Warta River and the Neisse River, while Koenigsberg is formally the soil of the Soviet Union. If you ask which country the construction industry of this strategic bunker will resist? It is extremely obvious that the Soviet Union fears the formation of the only large-scale (anti-Soviet group). Germany may be the wise man who sees wisdom in the group. The current policy of state-owned enterprises not only reveals a kind of fear, but also symbolizes the dizziness after victory. The foreign policy between the anti-Axis countries is launching a new stage full of political conflicts, that is, suppression and anti-suppression. This new stage is also establishing a so-called (new world political balance).</p>

<h3>Citizens Should Exert All Efforts to Strengthen Baojia Work; Baojia Propagandist Chen Riping Broadcasts</h3>
<p>Chen Riping, a Baojia propagandist in the urban area, delivered a speech titled "Strengthening Baojia to Cooperatively Defend" at the Shanghai Radio Station at 8:00 PM on the 19th. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>A few years ago in Shanghai, cases of robbery, assassination, and extortion occurred frequently, day and night. Since the establishment of the Baojia system and the organization of self-defense corps, all undesirable elements have had no place to hide, so such incidents have gradually decreased and are now rare. Although it can be said that considerable progress has been made, we cannot therefore neglect preventive measures. Especially in today's rapidly changing war situation, local security must be given more attention, so strengthening Baojia is an urgent matter. Since we already have a considerable understanding of the functions of Baojia, how to promote Baojia work to the point of perfection, so that it can exert greater effectiveness, should be considered a very important matter for all citizens.</p>
<p>Regarding Baojia, the authorities have already decided that in the future, important Baojia personnel will be selected through public recommendation, so that outstanding and impartial individuals can be elected to take on the work, making the Baojia organization even more complete. However, we hope that all Baojia personnel will work with impartiality, selflessness, and a spirit of prioritizing the greater good over individual interests, and not consider the matter unrelated to themselves and do things perfunctorily. It should be known that the Baojia organization is the foundation of people's self-governance and self-defense, and is a matter closely related to everyone. In peacetime, they must assist the police in clearing household registrations, assisting traffic, cooperating in fire prevention, paying attention to cleanliness and hygiene, and all administrative matters related to the public, in order to maintain local order, and enforce laws and regulations, prevent hoarding and speculation, and report illegal activities, so that the true meaning of Baojia can be achieved.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, in today's increasingly severe war situation, in addition to security, work such as air raid evacuation, rationing, and relief should also be taken into consideration. If the Baojia is densely and meticulously organized, and the self-defense corps is well-organized, it will be of great help in assisting the military and police. The complete preparation of the self-defense corps can not only maintain local security and all order, but also serve as a way for citizens to protect themselves and their families. Therefore, on the one hand, we hope that the Baojia and self-defense corps will strictly abide by discipline and fulfill their responsibilities; on the other hand, citizens should do their best to support and care for them, so that the Baojia can be strengthened and assist the military and police in all defense work during wartime and peacetime, while also providing various kinds of assistance to the people.</p>
