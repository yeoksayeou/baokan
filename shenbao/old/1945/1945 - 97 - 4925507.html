<p>東京六日中央社電　蘇聯通吿廢止日，蘇中立條約，日本朝野不以爲奇，微諸斯達林議長去年十一月蘇聯革命紀念日之演說及世界戰况之趨勢，即可洞悉。日·蘇中立倏約廢止，乃勢所必然，亦日本當局之意中事也。按日·蘇中立條約乃於一九四一年四月訂立，規定五年有效，若在滿期前一年條約關係國無廢止意思時，則可再延長五年。</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>社會領導人物的必要條件</h3>
<p>「政治」是管理衆人的事。所以，有關人民福利的一切事情，一定由政府領導辦理。有了好的政府，有了賢明的官吏，人民的態度，一方面應該擁護，一方面應該督促。可是，社會上一切事業，政府在事實上不能包辦無遺，同時，應由社會人土共同協力辦理，所以，社俞領導人物應該負起協助完成的任務。政府一切工作與社會一切工作相互配合以後，才能完成使人民獲得福利的使命。如果僅僅有了好政府，有了賢明的官吏，而沒有好社會，沒有賢明的社會領袖固然不能配合，同樣的，只有好社會而沒有好政府，也不能相得益彰。所以，兩者之問缺一不可。</p>
<p>其次，社會風氣的形成與轉變，社會領導人物的一舉一動足以發生影響作用。所以，社會風氣的轉變，全賴社會領導人物領導的適常與否。我們認爲身爲社會領導人物者，應具有幾個必要條件：　老誠練達。　公正無私。　任勞任怨。</p>
<p>第一，在目前上海社會的領導人物中？足稱老成練達者，雖然不多，可是，還不能說沒有，譬如幾位老前輩，都是老成練達的模範。</p>
<p>第二，做到公正無私，已經不易，可是，僅有公正無私仍是不够，還須具有熱忱。所謂熱忱應包括　不怕開罪於人。　認淸是非，造成社會輿論力量。　對壞人抨擊，使不敢拾頭。</p>
<p>第三，只要爲公衆福利之事，　力以赴，縱有非難，也必以任勞任怨之精神忍受一切。同時，對於自私自利者，輙在暗中佈置障礙，積習頗深，應有打破積習的勇氣，與惡勢力奮鬥的精神。</p>
<p>第四，有了老前輩領導仍是不够，應該隨時培養中堅份子，以爲替代與承繼的準備，老前輩尤須以前輩的地位，鼓勵保護。</p>
<p>有了上述條科具備的社會領袖，這個社會才能健全，才能逐步轉移風氣。</p>
<p>就本市而言，過去市政諮詢委員會市民福利協會等，會領導舉辦有關公衆的數事，如軍警贈金，冬賑，平價米，救濟庫券等等，這幾件事，都是爲市民謀取福利，都是協助政府爲謀市民福利。所以，在正常的目光中，沒有一件是對不起市民的。惟有自私自利之徒，只知有已不知有人之徒，只知權利不知義務之徒，才認爲是多事。然而，上海需要舉辦的社會公衆事業正多，現在不過開端而已。担當這些社會事業的領導責任者，老前輩固然不能退避，而中堅份子實嫌不够，應隨時培養，隨時物色提拔。</p>
<p>不過，一方面不免有一般自私之徒，只知權利之流，擠在社會領導人物中，口是心非，佯作周旋。如果這般人不即轉變自私心理，我們認爲爲使社會事業不受障礙，應予以排除，不使掛羊頭賣狗肉，而爲害羣之馬。因爲這般人混在其間，對於每次與公衆福利有關工作，都在暗中陰謀破壞活動，至少採取怠工態度。試問這般人掛了慈善團體董事的名義，而對於慈善公益，旣不出錢，叉不出力，更有什麼資格站在社會領導人物之列，除了自己認過改非，或自己知趣，退出逃避外，否則，深信社會輿論必不寬縱，總有一旦爲社會鄙棄的，我們願先予以警吿。</p>

<h3>吳江震澤一瞥</h3>
<p>— 劍萍</p>
<p>搭京滬綫的在快車西上，至蘇州已是次晨了，在城外旅館中休息了一會，即雇小汽車離蘇。往昔至平望有蘇嘉鐵路可通，自前歲拆除後，屬於公營的，每天僅一輛華中長途汽車，其他都是商辦的卡車，和小汽車，以及一二隻小輸船。我雇的小汽車，因爲燃燒木炭，機件陳舊的緣故，中途損壞，直到深晚始抵震澤。</p>
<p>震澤位於太湖之南，烏鎭之北，平望之西，南潯之東。距南潯僅十二里，但道短短的距離中，已劃分出江浙不同的地界。水路有運河，汽車路東通蘇州，西達湖州，故交通頗爲便利，屬於吳江縣管轄。鎭上有區長一人，現任區長名王承基，主理稅務及地方政治工作，鎭長　龔同，又兼農民敎育館館長。</p>
<p>物產</p>
<p>全鎭分東，南，西、北四柵，街道湫隘，商店櫛比，幾年來由於四鄰市鎭的衰落，於是形成目下畸形的繁榮。主要會品爲絲·羊毛·米·菜·柴等，全國聞名的「七里絲」即出產於南潯，震澤一帶。由於南潯近年市况的不景氣，震澤便形成絲經的大本營，每屆夏秋之季，絲經的買賣，擠塞得道路水洩不通，一年的興盛時期，也以此二季爲最。年來國外運輸不通，出口停止，更以捐稅重重，絲經業已不如前。</p>
<p>過去震澤有個大規模的絲廠，因兵　關係，早已停閉，所以除少數鄕農以人工木慶織綢外，（也比不上盛澤綢），對於本　的　　，　直可說沒有。</p>
<p>羊毛方面；現在正是春毛興旺的季節，價格變遷很大，因爲是綿羊，品質自較華北的山羊爲佳，日商經營此業的很多，現在上海的一般毛織廠，差不多也用那邊的產品。</p>
<p>民生</p>
<p>米價目下爲二萬左右，但米行沒有米資，其情形與滬相仿，都由鄕人秘密兜販。菜蔬有附近太湖的大靑菜，又鮮又嫩，向來運銷上海。柴有稻柴，桑柴之分，每担也要千餘元。房租數百元至數千兀不等，但到處滿坑滿谷。鷄蛋每只六七十元。豬肉較滬爲昂。菜油每斤一千四百元，因去冬汕菜凍斃，今年菜油的產量，恐也有不數供應之虞。本鎭的榨油事業甚不發達，祇有東柵一個油坊，採用人工及電力二種。除了魚蝦特廉外，其他日用品，均較滬昂貴，通常一個小家庭三四人，也要數萬元的開銷。</p>
<p>敎育</p>
<p>敎育方面極衰落，計小學有斜橋河小學，梅詩塲小學，池塘橋小學三所，都是縣立的。中學方面僅集成中學（私立的）·絲業中學（縣立的）二所，震澤原有聞名的震屬中學及育英中學，後者爲外交家施肇基所辦，大廈巍然，今則斷垣殘壁，景象凄慘。當地雖然沒有一所設備完善的醫院，但中西醫學人才頗多。</p>
<p>地方治安：有警察署·保安隊·濟鄕隊·偵緝隊等，故鎭上頗爲安全。四鄉則有遊匪，綁刧時聞。</p>
<p>震澤賭風盛熾，即三二孩童相賭，輸贏也以萬計，數十萬·百餘萬不足爲奇，或有以米的石數，和飾物作爲輸贏的。因爲富地缺乏娛樂事業，於是學相以轉蒲爲戲。聞某隊長筵間，一夜抵押飾物有兩抽斗之多，這個故事，不論眞假，總之足以形容震澤賭風的猖狂，較之素稱奢廉的上海，也恐有過之無不及吧！</p>
<p>金融</p>
<p>金融方面，僅祗達昌錢莊一家，通常都在蘇州滙劃的，各商號營業都取穩健態度，所以並不感到有調劑不數之虞。</p>
<p>在震澤數天，覺得雖然這樣一個鮮人聽聞小小的市鎭，但其生產的富庶，商業的繁榮，人民的安居樂業，在目下的江蘇省內，已不可多得了，在這疏散人口的當兒，震澤的工商業，正有待於被疏散的上海人去開拓呢。</p>
<h3>新運會修正　國民呼用語</h3>
<p>南京六日中央社電　新運促進會，茲將國民呼用語加以修正如下：　領導人繼承遺志，完成革命，我們全體要繼承遺志，完成革命。　領導人勇猛情進，刻苦耐勞，我們全體要勇猛精進，刻苦耐勞。　領導人興復中華，保衛東亞，全體呼興復中華保衛東亞。　領導人及全體　呼領袖精神不死，民族解放萬歲，中華民國萬歲萬歲萬萬歲。該項修正國民呼用語，即日起由該會公佈，並進飭各地新運分會及靑少年團總團部·靑年模範團團本部·各地靑年幹部學校施行。</p>
<h3>血型檢定　實施辦法</h3>
<p>南京六日中央社電　衛生署血型檢定委員會，為實施血型檢定，特訂定血型檢定實施辦法，並將其分為甲乙丙三種，甲種為食務員軍警學生團體公司工廠等，乙種為一般民衆。各地技術組實施時，應聯合當地公私立醫院檢騐機關醫師公會等，分組血型檢定班，提任檢定工作。該會復為使一般民衆明瞭該項檢定意義，擬繪製巨型漫畫及攝製幻燈片，俾廣宣傳，聞被檢者係在耳部抽取血液，檢騐時毫無痛苦。</p>
<h3>實部姜次長談煤斤運輸問題</h3>
<p>南京六日中央社電　實業部次長姜佐宣，前為煤斤增產問題，曾赴滬與各方接洽，日前返京談，關於運煤　令業已購妥俟督委會成立即開始啓運adt）區域，似欲與越歌法特（Erfurt）東進之中路部隊相連絡。但巴頓將軍是否企圖向哈勒（Halle）來比錫區前進，抑或轉向北以圖蓆捲威塞河之德軍陣該，現仍未能確定。美坦克車隊沿胡茲堡·安斯巴許公路前進，仍未能完全加以阻止。巴樞將軍部隊企圖自海爾勃倫向南西斯都加特前進，其意向已趨明顯。</p>
<h3>斯洛伐克前綫　德轉移陣地　蘇軍猛攻維也納</h3>
<p>柏林六日中央社電　海通社訊：維也納方面戰事，已達是緊張階段，洪國前綫及斯洛伐克中部，德軍採避離行動。</p>

<p>柏林六日中央社電　海通社訊，權威當局稱：德軍自斯洛伐克前綫撤退後，其前綫約由小喀爾巴任山麓之東北小山起，由東轉東北至紐索爾，再向北經羅森堡至賽布熈。</p>
<h3>智利對日宣戰</h3>
<p>里斯東六日中央社電　據聖地哥電：智利上院五日通過智利對日宣戰佈吿案。</p>
<h3>德抗戰決心　堅不動搖</h3>
<p>—郭培爾發表論文—</p>
<p>柏林六日中央社電　德國社訊，德宣長郭培爾在國家雜誌爲文稱：「敵人間對於世界問題意見紛歧，其所能一致同意者，爲毀滅德國及消滅德人，但關於此問題，彼等所用手段亦大不相同，各人皆思從他人手中奪取最大量之贓物，如敵人此種瘋狂得吿實現，則全世界將陷於可怖之慘境，不獨吾人之國家爲然。戰爭之現階段，不能僅從軍事事態判斷之，蓋軍事事態，雖有重要影響於最後決定，但其他民族上政治上社會上經濟上之事態，亦漸形顯露，將與軍事同其重要。吾人應注意此種事態，堅忍不拔，仍爲德人作戰之最高原則，吾人卸去此次戰爭之負担後，將立即致力於和平之任務，但在仍須負作戰之資時，吾人僅有一個口號，即以不可動搖之堅忍，抵抗敵人之進攻，以任何犧牲從事抗戰，勇往直前，幸運與不幸，皆不能使吾人有任何改變。</p>

<h3>羅斯福接受　蘇三票要求</h3>
<p>瑞典京城六日中央社電　德國社訊：英政界方面以爲羅斯福總統接受蘇方於舊金山會議中，擁有三倍代表權，而由美方僅保持一票之權，此種行動已避免外交上最嚴重危機，或即此次大戰中最大之危機。上週羅邱二氏以電話通話之忙碌情形，爲此次大戰中所僅見。</p>

<h3>本市猪肉運銷近況</h3>
<p>— 家熙</p>
<p>「寗可食無肉，不可　無竹」，這是古時雅人們的話；由於營養的關係，近代人早已「寗可居無竹，不可食無肉」了。以五百萬人的大都市，猪肉的消耗量自然很大。爲了明暸內中情形，特走訪猪肉零售商同業公自理事長黃啓動氏，承黃氏詳告蘭於該業情形如次：</p>
<p>猪隻來源</p>
<p>上海消耗的猪肉，主要來源有下列二綫：一爲江北方面，如泰州·泰與·東台·如畢·盟城，以及淮安·淮陰·宿遷·泗陽等地。二爲津浦綫方面，如明光·淮州·徐州·當途·蕪湖等地。戰前以上兩綫猪隻每月運滬數量在十萬頭以上，戰後因生產減少，運輸因難及購買力關係，至今每月運滬猪隻，統扯總數僅只三萬多頭。其中七成由江北裝來，三成由津浦綫號來·此外京滬·滬杭兩綫·如蘇州·嘉興·杭州·　石等地，每月也養來一二千頭，羣中人稱之爲「行猪」；但上述京滬滬杭綫各地，有時反有來滬採辦者。至於所謂「鄉諸」，則指滬市近郊所毫者而言，爲數樣徽，對市價上下，影響很少。</p>
<p>市價形成</p>
<p>查各原產地地猪隻價格，至今還很低廉。如江北猪（平均七十公斤）每頭約值四萬至六萬元，津浦綫因還輪困難，價格更廉，每頭自一萬至三萬元。</p>
<p>上海牲畜市塲及鮮猪販賣所的售價，實一度昂至每担十萬零五千元，黑市據設還賓。照理說眅賣商該獲利頗厚了，實則也不　然。因　進價　低，可是沿途的開銷却很大；加之有病猪死猪及被劫等意外損失，所以眅猪來滬，盈虧也在「未定之歡」的。</p>
<p>猪隻目原產地裝運來鴻，中途所加繳各費，有四十餘項，每次每顯目數十元至數千元本等，連滙水在內，合計每猪所加在三萬元以上。諸隻到滬後，須徑過市塲及經紀人之手，再由批發商批售與各零售商號，價格又要增加一二成，猪肉零售價格因此愈見高昂了。</p>
<p>關於限價</p>
<p>自當局限制肉價以後，有肉舖多家受罰，然而黑市仍未消滅，關於這問題，黃氏除了表示決意以固集公會理事長的立場，協助　府抑平物價；同時也希　當局諒解該　害裏。因爲當局這次限價　於　售商，對販賣商　批發商，並未限　，因此販賣商　批發商等仍　　　出售，批價一度增高至每斤一千二三百元，　　商出入相較，不數甚鉅，於是股實者停寧觀導；實力薄　的店舖，擭戶及非會員等，因開支不能錐持，便冒險耗營黑市，往往受罰，說來實堪解憫。</p>
<p>當周公定肉個，，是切要之　；但如果能從到埠毛猪價格規定起，再定出批發價及零售價，則執行上可以減少許多　　。今日市上的猪肉，原是昨日的毛猪，完全依照供求量而上下其價，分猪肉不超出限量，日應先從限制毛猪價格着手。</p>
<p>按黃氏曾向經濟當局建議設立評議會，經擬其詳細辦法，雖徑核准，終因各方意見粉歧，至今猶未實現。</p>
<h3>今日愛馬節　舉行慶祝儀式</h3>
<p>上海體育會以今（七）日爲愛馬佳節，定於下午一時在該會跑馬聽舉行慶祝儀式，同時並有特賽節目，昨已東邀本市各機關長官蒞臨參加盛典，局時當必有一番盛况。　按日本明治之世，爲振興馬政，特定四月七日爲一愛馬節」。每年此日，必於各地舉行陣亡軍馬慰靈祭，及軍民合作之馬術競賽會，以期養成全國愛馬之風氣。</p>

<h3>滿洲國的靑少年運動</h3>
<p>—昨止懇談會席上滿代表報吿—</p>
<p>滿靑少年訓練目標　　滿洲國代表韓樹棟昨日在懇談會席上發表靑少年運動經過，略謂：「關於滿洲國靑少年運動，在建國後，舉國頗爲注意。爲求建設今後國家，必須看重於第二代靑年，故在建國後，待別進行靑少年遝動。在民國二十六年即康德四年時，由政府軍民規定靑年訓練之規熱，開始進行。鬧又在中央協和會之統一機構下主持，此後靑少年之活動蓬勃。於民國二十九年時，靑年團之奉勞力量至巨，如建設京河綫（新京至哈爾濱），哈大路（哈爾濱至大連）等各方道路建設，均由靑年担當。因此對方對靑年之發展，極爲重視，乃有國民勤勞奉公隊之設設置。</p>
<p>訓練方面，靑年訓練可以縣區爲單位，分　訓練靑年團學員　　學員之再鍊成，　幹部訓練，還及全斷。至團的組織，自十一歲至十六歲爲少年國，十六歲至二十三歲爲靑年團，男女一律。再有靑年行動隊之組織，集優秀組成，其任爲協助治安，述絡情報救火防空等等。此外，如少年機械隊·化工隊·海洋隊等。</p>
<p>活動概况，增產活動包括　荒。</p>
<p>滿洲國的靑少年運動昨日懇談會席上滿代表報告造林·種籽消毒·土糞改造造等等，均俊少年團之工作。又有運輪糧食，禁烟運動以及防範活動，緊急救獲防空等等。至在文化上之活動亦頗多，並有體格檢查，以及發起登山等等。故今後之訓練方針及敎育目標，第一爲增强戰力，增加生產，開發產業。第二為昂揚國家觀念。今後每一滿洲國民，都養成為國家為東亞之大我觀念。」</p>
<p>國民勤勞奉公制度　　滿洲國國民勤勞奉公隊練成處長　　元發表勤勞奉公制度，略謂：「關於滿洲國國民勤勞奉公隊，以靑少所為主體，即以靑少年爲出發點。其編制自二十一歲至二十三歲，不論舉國人民，在此年齡之內，尚未爲國民者，均須參加勤勞奉公制度。故動勞舉公在滿洲國爲國家行政，頒布奉公法，其制度應時局上之需要實施進行，爲團家增加重要產業，每人均書最大之努力奉行，亦即國民應盡之義務。其間雖規定數員公務員以及服務重要生產者，可予豁免，惟須觀其服務此項　業者，必在該適當舉行年齡十所以上者，方可準許，否則半途　業，則仍須服行勞動奉公，以杜流　，故此項制度，以立法之精神，　成國民應進之義務。其服務時間規定每日八小時工作，一切生活，人民莫不　予參與。其編組計分隊小隊中隊以致大　，在每一鄉區展開，養成從鄉士觀念而發展至國家觀念。</p>
<p>至幹部之訓練，每年予以嚴格訓導，以規例行動紀律為中心，期使發揮指導大衆。同時重視干部思想之鞏固，否則必須加以再度訓練，二次三次不等。故目前滿州國對動勞奉公隊之負擔龐大。</p>
<p>關於勤勞奉公隊之編成，第一必須治安鞏固，第二必須政治廉潔，第三必須戶口淸查，第四靑少年幹部訓練，事先必須有嚴密步驟，故滿舟國之忠誠奉公國民，認為第一成功。」</p>

<h3>General Suzuki Receives Imperial Mandate; Begins Organizing New Cabinet; Selections for Army and Navy Ministers Largely Determined</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - General Kantaro Suzuki (pictured), tasked with forming a cabinet, is using his residence in Maruyama-cho, Koishikawa Ward, as his cabinet-building headquarters and began organizing the cabinet on the morning of the 6th. General Keisuke Okada also visited General Suzuki's cabinet-building headquarters at 8:00 AM on the 6th.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - General Kantaro Suzuki, who received the imperial mandate to form a cabinet, visited former Prime Minister Koiso, Reijiro Wakatsuki, Fumimaro Konoe, Kiichiro Hiranuma, and other senior statesmen around 3:00 PM on the 6th to report on receiving the imperial mandate. Afterwards, he returned to his cabinet-building headquarters and summoned Kazue Shida to discuss matters. It is reported that the selections for Army and Navy Ministers are largely determined. Suzuki plans to finalize the entire cabinet on the morning of the 7th, have an audience with the Emperor, and hold the investiture ceremony in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - After the Koiso cabinet resigned en masse, Baron Kantaro Suzuki, the incumbent President of the Privy Council and Admiral of the Navy, was ordered to organize a successor cabinet. On the morning of the 5th at 10:30 AM, Prime Minister Koiso convened an extraordinary cabinet meeting and respectfully presented the letters of resignation of the cabinet members to the Emperor. His Majesty the Emperor then summoned Kido Koichi, the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal, to inquire about the leader of the succeeding cabinet. The Lord Keeper summoned senior statesmen to the Imperial Palace at 6:00 PM to carefully solicit their opinions. It was then decided that Privy Councillor Baron Kantaro Suzuki was the most suitable candidate for the leadership of the succeeding cabinet. After the senior statesmen's meeting concluded at 8:40 PM, they immediately went to the Palace to pay their respects to His Majesty the Emperor and present the proposed plan. Privy Councillor Suzuki then went to the Palace at 10:00 PM, had an audience with the Emperor, received the imperial mandate to form a cabinet, and requested time for consideration before leaving the Emperor's presence.</p>
<p>Brief Biography of General Suzuki</p>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Admiral Kantaro Suzuki, who was ordered to form a cabinet, was born in Sekiyado, Chiba Prefecture, in the third year of the Keio era. He is 79 years old this year and is the elder brother of Lieutenant General Takao Suzuki, the chief priest of Yasukuni Shrine. In Japan, it is extremely rare for two brothers to both be generals. He graduated from the Naval Academy in the 21st year of the Meiji era and was commissioned as a Navy Ensign the following year. In the fourth year of the Showa era, he was personally appointed as Chamberlain by the Chief of the Naval General Staff and served until his retirement. During these 44 years, he served in the Navy Department, holding positions as Director of both the Personnel and Military Affairs Bureaus of the Navy Ministry, Vice Minister of the Navy, Commander-in-Chief of the Second and Third Fleets, Commander-in-Chief of the Kure Naval District, Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, and Military Councilor. In the 14th year of the Taisho era, he assumed the important position of Chief of the Naval General Staff. He retired in January of the 4th year of Showa and succeeded Count Sutemi Chinda as Chamberlain and concurrently Privy Councilor. The Emperor held him in high esteem. He was wounded during the February 26th Incident in the 11th year of Showa. In November of that year, he resigned from the position of Chamberlain and was granted the title of Baron. In June of the 15th year of Showa, after Vice President Yoshimichi Hara was promoted to President, he succeeded him as Vice President. In August of the 19th year of Showa, President Hara passed away, and he was promoted to President of the Privy Council, a position he holds to this day, having served in the Privy Council for 16 years. While serving in the Navy Ministry, he was considered an authority on Japanese naval tactics. As Vice Minister of the Navy, he assisted Navy Minister Yatsushiro, preventing the Navy Minister, who was not well-versed in military administration, from deviating from the norm, and demonstrated extraordinary skill in personnel administration within the ministry. He was regarded as a candidate for Navy Minister, but General Suzuki often said, "I am not a tool for military administration; I am a naval officer. I hope to go to sea," and consistently maintained the original character of a military man, eventually becoming Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, the highest honor, and finally Chief of the Naval General Staff. It is a miracle that the serious injuries General Suzuki sustained in the February 26th Incident were healed. To this day, a bullet remains in his body, and at the age of 79, his spirit is still like that of a young man, maintaining his straightforward military style.</p>
<h3>Lieutenant General Kuribayashi Promoted to General</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Lieutenant General Tadamichi Kuribayashi of the Japanese Army, since assuming the position of supreme commander of the Iwo Jima area, has staunchly defended the key point in the south, repeatedly inflicting heavy damage on the enemy forces. In the past month, he has fought bravely and desperately defended Iwo Jima to the best of his ability, achieving the great victory of annihilating 33,000 enemy soldiers. His efforts have reached the ears of the Emperor, and by imperial order, he has been posthumously promoted to the rank of General.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Notifies Japan of Termination of Neutrality Pact</h3>
<p>Moscow, 6th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov met with Japanese Ambassador Sato on the afternoon of the 5th and stated that the Neutrality Pact concluded between Japan and the Soviet Union on April 13, 1941, has lost its meaning due to the fundamental changes in the situation that have occurred since then. Therefore, based on Article 3 of the treaty, the Soviet government is notifying the Japanese government of its intention to terminate the treaty. Ambassador Sato promised to convey the above notification to his home government before leaving.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Japanese government and public did not find the Soviet Union's notification of the termination of the Japan-Soviet Neutrality Pact surprising. It could be discerned from Chairman Stalin's speech at the Soviet Revolution anniversary last November and the trend of the world war situation. The termination of the Japan-Soviet Neutrality Pact is inevitable and is also what the Japanese authorities expected. The Japan-Soviet Neutrality Pact was established in April 1941 and stipulated a validity period of five years. If neither of the treaty parties expressed an intention to terminate the treaty one year before the expiration date, it could be extended for another five years.</p>
<p>Japanese Foreign Ministry Issues Statement</p>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - After receiving an official telegram regarding the Soviet Union's notification of the termination of the Japan-Soviet Treaty on the 6th, the Japanese Foreign Ministry issued the following statement at 2:00 PM: Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov notified Japanese Ambassador Sato on April 5th that the Japan-Soviet Neutrality Treaty was signed on April 13, 1941, before the outbreak of the German-Soviet War and the Japanese war against Britain and the United States. However, fundamental changes have occurred in the world situation since then. Japan has aided Germany in its war against the Soviet Union and is at war with the Allied powers of Britain and the United States, which are allied with the Soviet Union. Under these circumstances, the Japan-Soviet Neutrality Treaty has lost its meaning. Therefore, based on Article 3 of the treaty, the Soviet government declares that the term of the Japan-Soviet Neutrality Treaty will not be extended after its expiration next April.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - German News Agency report, Washington: Well-informed sources in the US Senate say that the Soviet Union's announcement of the cancellation of the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Treaty is one of the secret agreements of the Yalta Conference. Furthermore, according to the US State Department's recent evaluation of the current situation: "The US government naturally welcomes the Soviet government's cancellation of the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Treaty."</p>
<h3>MacArthur Appointed Commander-in-Chief of Army in Pacific Operations</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 6th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - German News Agency report, the US Army General Staff announced yesterday: General MacArthur will command all anti-Axis army forces in the Pacific Theater, while Admiral Nimitz will command the navy in the same theater.</p>

<p>Fierce Fighting Still Occurring Around Baguio</p>
<p>Luzon Front, 6th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The enemy near Baguio has invaded the mountains and is advancing with all their might, continuing localized engagements with the Japanese army. The enemy advancing east along the Naguilian Road is constructing roads with small units near Alingay, 5 kilometers east of Pugo on the road, and has advanced northeast to a point 15 kilometers east of that location. On the night of the 3rd, they attacked Mount Lombo, east of that location, with a large number of tanks (10), self-propelled guns, mountain guns, and mortars. The Japanese army responded with fierce artillery fire, killing or wounding half of them and repelling them. Near Bugo, the enemy is extending roads in the northern mountains. In the morning, approximately two companies of infantry, under the cover of heavy artillery fire, attacked a point 2 kilometers northeast of Bugo. Fierce fighting continues in the direction of Salaksak Ridge. Approximately 30% of the enemy troops are bandits.</p>
<p>Japanese Army on Cebu Island Reports War Results</p>
<p>Philippines, 6th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The morale of the Japanese garrison troops on Cebu Island is extremely high. They are staunchly defending their defensive positions under intense enemy naval bombardment and are repeatedly counterattacking enemy positions with heroic close-quarters combat units, inflicting great damage on the enemy.

<h3>Battle on Okinawa Island Intensifying</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - After crossing Okinawa Island, the American enemy is rushing south, continuing their southward advance on three fronts with units from the east coast, the central area, and the west coast. On the east coast, the enemy advanced to Kuba on the afternoon of the 3rd, rapidly increasing reinforcements. By the afternoon of the 5th, approximately 5,000 enemy infantry with 200 tanks had invaded the area of Wauge (6 kilometers southwest of Kuba). At noon on the 5th, over 30 enemy vessels, centered around battleships and cruisers, invaded Nakagusuku Bay and began mine-sweeping operations. At the same time, they subjected the Japanese army's positions to intense naval bombardment, covering the enemy ground forces moving south. In the central area, a considerable number of enemy troops, utilizing several tanks, attacked our position at Guku on the morning of the 5th. The Japanese army immediately launched a brave counterattack, stopping the enemy's advance. In the west coast area, the enemy attempted to break through the 385-meter-high hill southeast of Oyama, but were repelled by the Japanese army. The enemy is currently urgently attempting to reinforce their forces and is continuing to transport personnel and supplies ashore with over 300 landing craft in front of Chatan.</p>

<h3>The Necessary Conditions for Social Leaders</h3>
<p>"Politics" is the management of public affairs. Therefore, all matters concerning the welfare of the people must be led and managed by the government. When there is a good government and wise officials, the people should, on the one hand, support it and, on the other hand, supervise it. However, the government cannot, in fact, handle all social affairs single-handedly. Instead, they should be jointly managed by members of society. Therefore, social leaders should take on the task of assisting in completing these tasks. Only when the government's work and the work of society are coordinated can the mission of providing welfare to the people be accomplished. If there is only a good government and wise officials but no good society or wise social leaders, it cannot be coordinated. Similarly, if there is only a good society but no good government, the two cannot complement each other. Therefore, both are indispensable.</p>
<p>Secondly, the formation and transformation of social customs and mores, and the actions of social leaders are enough to have an impact. Therefore, the transformation of social customs depends entirely on whether the leadership of social leaders is appropriate. We believe that a person who is a social leader should have several necessary conditions: old age and experience, integrity and impartiality, and willingness to work hard and endure hardship.</p>
<p>First, among the current social leaders in Shanghai, there are not many who can be called old and experienced, but it cannot be said that there are none. For example, several senior predecessors are models of old age and experience.</p>
<p>Second, it is not easy to achieve integrity and impartiality. However, it is not enough to have only integrity and impartiality; one must also have enthusiasm. The so-called enthusiasm should include: not being afraid of offending people, identifying right and wrong, and creating the power of public opinion in society; and attacking bad people so that they dare not raise their heads.</p>
<p>Third, as long as it is for the benefit of the public, they must do their best, and even if there are criticisms, they must endure everything with the spirit of working hard and enduring hardship. At the same time, there are often those who are selfish and self-serving, secretly setting up obstacles, and this deeply ingrained habit should be broken with the courage to break it, and the spirit to fight against evil forces.</p>
<p>Fourth, it is not enough to have old predecessors leading; middle-level members should be cultivated at any time in preparation for replacement and inheritance, and old predecessors must encourage and protect them in their positions as predecessors.</p>
<p>Only with social leaders who possess the above-mentioned conditions can this society be healthy and gradually transform its customs and mores.</p>
<p>In the case of this city, in the past, the Municipal Advisory Committee, the Citizens' Welfare Association, etc., led the organization of several public affairs, such as donations to the military and police, winter relief, low-priced rice, and relief bonds, etc. These few things were all for the benefit of the citizens and were all assisting the government in seeking the welfare of the citizens. Therefore, from a normal perspective, none of them are letting the citizens down. Only those who are selfish and self-serving, those who only know themselves and not others, and those who only know rights and not obligations, think it is meddling. However, there are many social public undertakings that Shanghai needs to carry out, and now it is only the beginning. Those who shoulder the leadership responsibility for these social undertakings, the old predecessors cannot retreat, and the middle-level members are really not enough, and should be cultivated at any time, and good ones should be sought out and promoted at any time.</p>
<p>However, on the one hand, it is inevitable that there are selfish people who only know their rights, crowding into the ranks of social leaders, saying one thing and meaning another, pretending to mediate. If these people do not change their selfish mentality immediately, we believe that in order to prevent social undertakings from being obstructed, they should be eliminated, so as not to hang a sheep's head and sell dog meat, and harm the herd. Because these people are mixed in, they secretly conspire to sabotage every work related to public welfare, or at least take a passive attitude. May I ask, what qualifications do these people have to stand in the ranks of social leaders, who have the name of directors of charitable organizations, but do not contribute money or effort to charity and public welfare? Unless they recognize their mistakes and change them, or they know better and retreat and escape, otherwise, it is deeply believed that public opinion will not be lenient, and they will be despised by society one day. We are willing to give a warning first.</p>

<h3>A Glimpse of Zhenze, Wujiang</h3>
<p>— Jianping</p>
<p>Taking the Beijing-Shanghai line on the express train west, it is already the next morning when you arrive in Suzhou. After resting for a while in a hotel outside the city, hire a small car to leave Suzhou. In the past, the Sujia Railway could be used to reach Pingwang, but since it was dismantled the year before last, the only public-operated transportation is one China Central long-distance bus per day. The rest are commercially operated trucks, small cars, and one or two small transport ships. The small car I hired broke down halfway due to burning charcoal and its old machinery. It was not until late at night that I arrived in Zhenze.</p>
<p>Zhenze is located south of Taihu Lake, north of Wuzhen, west of Pingwang, and east of Nanxun. It is only twelve li from Nanxun, but in that short distance, the different boundaries of Jiangsu and Zhejiang have already been demarcated. The waterway has a canal, and the road connects Suzhou to the east and Huzhou to the west, so transportation is quite convenient and under the jurisdiction of Wujiang County. The town has a district head, currently Wang Chengji, who is in charge of taxation and local political work, and the town head is Gong Tong, who also serves as the head of the Farmers' Education Center.</p>
<p>Products</p>
<p>The entire town is divided into East, South, West, and North sections. The streets are narrow, and the shops are lined up. In recent years, due to the decline of the surrounding towns, it has formed a distorted prosperity. The main products are silk, wool, rice, vegetables, firewood, etc. The nationally famous "Qili Silk" is produced in the Nanxun and Zhenze area. Due to the economic downturn in Nanxun in recent years, Zhenze has become a major base for the silk trade. During the summer and autumn seasons, the silk trade is so congested that the roads are impassable. These two seasons are also the most prosperous time of the year. In recent years, due to the obstruction of foreign transportation and the cessation of exports, as well as heavy taxes, the silk industry is not as good as before.</p>
<p>In the past, Zhenze had a large-scale silk factory, but it was closed long ago due to the war. Therefore, apart from a few rural farmers weaving silk by hand with wooden looms (which is not as good as Shengze silk), there is almost no manufacturing in this area.</p>
<p>Regarding wool, it is currently the prosperous season for spring wool, and prices fluctuate greatly. Because it is sheep's wool, the quality is better than the goat wool in North China. Many Japanese merchants are engaged in this industry, and most of the wool weaving factories in Shanghai now use their products.</p>
<p>People's Livelihood</p>
<p>The current rice price is around 20,000, but the rice shops do not have rice, similar to the situation in Shanghai, where villagers secretly peddle it. Vegetables include the large green vegetables from nearby Taihu Lake, which are fresh and tender and have always been transported to Shanghai for sale. Firewood is divided into rice straw and mulberry branches, and each load costs more than a thousand yuan. Rents range from several hundred yuan to several thousand yuan, but it is full everywhere. Chicken eggs cost sixty or seventy yuan each. Pork is more expensive than in Shanghai. Vegetable oil costs 1,400 yuan per jin, and due to the freezing of cabbage in the winter, the production of vegetable oil this year is likely to be insufficient. The oil extraction industry in this town is not very developed. Only one oil mill in the East section uses both manual and electric power. Except for fish and shrimp, which are especially cheap, other daily necessities are more expensive than in Shanghai. Usually, a small family of three or four people needs tens of thousands of yuan in expenses.</p>
<p>Education</p>
<p>Education is extremely declining. There are three elementary schools: Xieqiaohe Elementary School, Meishichang Elementary School, and Chitangqiao Elementary School, all of which are county-run. There are only two middle schools: Jicheng Middle School (private) and Silk Industry Middle School (county-run). Zhenze used to have the famous Zhenshu Middle School and Yuying Middle School. The latter was run by diplomat Shi Zhaoji, and the building was magnificent, but now it is a ruined wall and a tragic scene. Although there is no well-equipped hospital in the local area, there are many talented people in Chinese and Western medicine.</p>
<p>Local Security: There are police stations, security teams, Jixiang teams, and detective teams, so the town is quite safe. In the countryside, there are roaming bandits, and kidnappings are sometimes heard.</p>
<p>Gambling is rampant in Zhenze. Even children gamble, and the winnings and losses amount to tens of thousands. Hundreds of thousands or even millions are not uncommon. Some use stones of rice and ornaments as winnings and losses. Because the rich area lacks entertainment, they learn to use gambling as a play. It is said that a certain captain at a banquet mortgaged so many ornaments overnight that there were two drawers full. Whether this story is true or false, it is enough to describe the rampant gambling in Zhenze, which is probably even worse than Shanghai, which is known for its luxury.</p>
<p>Finance</p>
<p>In terms of finance, there is only one Dachang Bank, which usually transfers money in Suzhou. All business firms take a steady attitude, so they do not feel that there is a shortage of regulation.</p>
<p>During my several days in Zhenze, I felt that although it is a small town that few people have heard of, its rich production, commercial prosperity, and the people's peaceful life are rare in Jiangsu Province today. At this time of dispersing the population, Zhenze's industry and commerce are waiting to be developed by Shanghai people who have been dispersed.</p>

<h3>Germany's Determination to Resist Remains Unshaken</h3>
<p>— Goebbels Publishes Article —</p>
<p>Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) - German News Agency reports: German Propaganda Minister Goebbels wrote in the national magazine: "The enemies have divergent opinions on world issues, and the only thing they can unanimously agree on is to destroy Germany and eliminate the German people. However, they use very different means to achieve this goal, and each wants to seize the largest amount of loot from the hands of others. If this madness of the enemy were to be realized, the whole world would fall into a terrible tragedy, not just our country. The current stage of the war cannot be judged solely from the military situation, because although the military situation has an important impact on the final decision, other national, political, social, and economic situations are also gradually becoming apparent and will be as important as the military situation. We should pay attention to these situations. Perseverance is still the highest principle for Germans to fight. After we remove the burden of this war, we will immediately devote ourselves to the task of peace, but while we still have to bear the burden of war, we only have one slogan, that is, to resist the enemy's attack with unshakable perseverance, to fight at any cost, to move forward bravely, and neither good fortune nor misfortune can make us change in any way."</p>

<h3>U.S. Central Army on Western Front Penetrates Thuringia; Northern Army Crosses the Weser River</h3>
<p>Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The northern and central wings of the anti-Axis forces on the Western Front have penetrated deep into German territory and are engaged in street fighting in Osnabruck and Karlsruhe.</p>
<p>Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Havas Agency reports: The anti-Axis forces are increasing pressure on four lines, with the focus of the attack in the area between the Ems and Weser rivers and in Thuringia. After crossing the Ems-Weser Canal, part of the anti-Axis forces advanced along the Ems, while another part attacked towards the Weser. The left wing of the U.S. Third Army is fighting in the Werra River area, and its right-wing tank column has reached Arnstadt, apparently seeking to link up with the central force advancing east from Erfurt. However, it is still uncertain whether General Patton intends to advance towards the Halle-Leipzig area or turn north to sweep away the German defenses on the Weser River. The advance of the U.S. tank column along the Wurzburg-Ansbach highway has not been completely stopped. The intention of General Patton's forces to advance south from Heilbronn to Stuttgart is becoming increasingly clear.</p>

<h3>Chinese and Manchukuo Youth Representatives Held Symposium Yesterday; Manchukuo Consul General Hosts Banquet for Representatives</h3>
<p>Li Shudong (Deputy Chief of the Shuangcheng County Headquarters of the Manchukuo Concordia Association), Cao Jiyuan (Director of the Training and Guidance Department of the National Labor Service Corps Headquarters), Liu Zhongxiu (Official in the General Affairs Office of the National Labor Service Corps), Zhang Wen (Leader of the Youth Class of the Haicheng County Headquarters of the Concordia Association), and Wang Guichun (Official of the Manchukuo Ministry of Foreign Affairs), a group of five representatives from the Youth League and National Labor Service Corps of the Manchukuo Concordia Association, came to China recently to study the situation of youth leagues in our country. The Manchukuo delegation arrived in Shanghai from Beijing a few days ago. Yesterday (6th) afternoon at 4 o'clock, under the auspices of the Manchukuo Consul General, they hosted Shanghai youth representatives and local news reporters at the Bimao Hotel for a symposium to exchange ideas.</p>
<p>Chinese and Manchukuo Representatives Gather Together</p>
<p>The Manchukuo delegation arrived on time under the leadership of Consul General Ye De and Wang Wenjingyi, an official from the consulate. On the Chinese youth side, Gu Senchen, Secretary-General of the Shanghai New Movement Branch, along with secretaries and organization section chief Shen Taiyi, training section chief Wu Tiaofei, Li Liguo of the China Youth Model 4th Regiment, Ding Sheng and Wang Gang of the Youth League Municipal Headquarters 1st District, and over fifty reporters from various newspapers in the city attended. During the meeting, Consul General Ye De first introduced the representatives visiting Shanghai and described the rapid progress of Manchukuo's construction since its founding thirteen years ago. Then, representative Han Shudong reported on the Manchukuo youth movement and its current tasks. Next, representative Cao Jiyuan reported on the National Labor Service Corps system. Afterwards, Shen Jifeng, organization section chief of the Shanghai New Movement Branch, and Wu Duanfeng, training section chief, successively presented the organization and training process of the Chinese New Youth League. Then, Li Liguo of the China Youth Model 4th Regiment and Shao Yugang of the China Youth 1st District successively presented detailed information on the organization of the model team and the general situation of the Youth League in Tai City. During the meeting, Chinese and Manchukuo representatives had in-depth discussions on the situation of youth in their respective countries, and the atmosphere was extremely warm. At 6 p.m., Consul General Ye De hosted a banquet to welcome the representatives of the Chinese and Manchukuo youth leagues and local news reporters. There was lively conversation and toasts, and the guests and hosts parted happily at 8 p.m.</p>
<p>Consul General Ye De Delivered a Speech of Introduction</p>
<p>Consul General Ye De first delivered an introductory speech, stating in brief: "Today, I introduce the youth league and labor service corps representatives dispatched by the Concordia Association of our country to meet with you. I sincerely hope that you will conduct a thorough study and review of the youth and labor service systems of our country. I am particularly pleased that you have taken the time from your busy schedules to attend. Although the founding period of Manchukuo is short, in these thirteen years, all domestic construction has achieved an era-transcending speed. At a time when the world is at war, on the one hand, we are working hard to increase national production, and on the other hand, we are contributing to the world, especially to East Asia. Manchukuo has realized the strengthening of national power under difficult and arduous circumstances and doubled labor. Therefore, Manchukuo is vigorously carrying out the youth movement. It is believed that the spirit of our country's founding, under the auspices of the Concordia Association, enables every youth to obtain effective results. Looking back since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, our country has made the greatest efforts in increasing industry in the rear. In order to strengthen production, it is necessary to gather the strength of the whole country and national mobilization. In order to further enhance it, there is a labor service system that is widely implemented in the country. It is believed that the implementation of labor service increases production and has been very effective since it began two years ago. At this time when the Greater East Asia War is fierce, we must unite and work together to strengthen production and complete the revival of East Asia as soon as possible, and prevent the Anglo-American enemy from invading. Today, we gather together with enthusiasm, and I sincerely hope that we will have a sincere discussion."</p>

<h3>Recent Developments in Pork Sales and Transportation in the City</h3>
<p>— Jiaxi</p>
<p>"Better to eat without meat than to live without bamboo," these were the words of ancient literati. Due to nutritional concerns, modern people have long since adopted "Better to live without bamboo than to eat without meat." As a metropolis with five million people, the consumption of pork is naturally very large. In order to understand the situation, I specifically visited Huang Qidong, chairman of the Pork Retailers' Guild, who kindly provided detailed information on the industry as follows:</p>
<p>Sources of Pigs</p>
<p>The main sources of pork consumed in Shanghai are as follows: one is the Jiangbei area, such as Taizhou, Taiyu, Dongtai, Rubao, Mengcheng, as well as Huaian, Huaiyin, Suqian, and Siyang. The second is the Jinpu Railway line, such as Mingguang, Huaizhou, Xuzhou, Dangtu, and Wuhu. Before the war, the number of pigs transported to Shanghai from these two lines each month was more than 100,000. After the war, due to reduced production, transportation difficulties, and purchasing power, the total number of pigs transported to Shanghai each month is only more than 30,000. Among them, 70% are shipped from Jiangbei and 30% from the Jinpu Railway line. In addition, about 1,000 to 2,000 heads are transported from the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines, such as Suzhou, Jiaxing, and Hangzhou, each month, which people in the industry call "traveling pigs." However, the above-mentioned areas on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines sometimes come to Shanghai to purchase. As for the so-called "country pigs," they refer to those raised in the suburbs of Shanghai. The number is very small, and it has little impact on market prices.</p>
<p>Market Price Formation</p>
<p>The prices of pigs in various places of origin are still very low. For example, a Jiangbei pig (average 70 kilograms) is worth about 40,000 to 60,000 yuan per head. The Jinpu Railway line is even cheaper due to transportation difficulties, with each head ranging from 10,000 to 30,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The selling price at the Shanghai Livestock Market and Fresh Pork Sales Office once soared to 105,000 yuan per dan. It is said that the black market is even more expensive. In theory, the resellers should have made a considerable profit, but this is not the case. Although the purchase price is low, the expenses along the way are very large. In addition, there are unexpected losses such as sick pigs, dead pigs, and robberies. Therefore, the profit or loss of selling pigs to Shanghai is also uncertain.</p>
<p>There are more than 40 types of fees added along the way from the origin of the pigs to Shanghai, ranging from dozens to thousands of yuan each time, including remittance fees, totaling more than 30,000 yuan per pig. After the pigs arrive in Shanghai, they must pass through the market and the hands of brokers, and then be sold wholesale to various retailers, and the price will increase by another 10-20%. Therefore, the retail price of pork is becoming more and more expensive.</p>
<p>Regarding Price Limits</p>
<p>Since the authorities restricted pork prices, many meat shops have been punished, but the black market has not been eliminated. Regarding this issue, Huang expressed his determination to assist the government in suppressing prices as the chairman of the guild, and also hoped that the authorities would understand the difficulties of the industry. Because the authorities' price limit this time only applies to retailers, and there is no limit on sellers and wholesalers, sellers and wholesalers still sell at high prices, and the wholesale price once increased to 1,200 to 1,300 yuan per catty. Compared with the retailers' income and expenses, the difference is very large. Therefore, those with strong capital stop and wait and see; shops with weak capital, squatters, and non-members, because they cannot sustain their expenses, risk operating on the black market and are often punished, which is truly sympathetic.</p>
<p>It is essential to set a fair pork price; but if the price of live pigs arriving at the port can be regulated first, and then the wholesale price and retail price can be set, the execution can be reduced a lot. The pork on the market today is the live pig of yesterday, and the price fluctuates completely according to the supply and demand. To prevent the pork from exceeding the limit, it is necessary to start by restricting the price of live pigs.</p>
<p>Huang once suggested to the economic authorities to establish a review committee, and drafted detailed measures, which were approved, but have not been realized due to divergent opinions from all parties.</p>
<h3>Today is Horse Loving Day; Celebration Ceremony Held</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Sports Association has designated today (7th) as Horse Loving Day and will hold a celebration ceremony at its racecourse at 1 p.m. There will also be special race programs. The association invited the heads of various agencies in the city yesterday to attend the grand ceremony. It will surely be a grand occasion at that time. In the Meiji era of Japan, in order to promote horse administration, April 7th was specifically designated as "Horse Loving Day." Every year on this day, memorial services for fallen military horses and equestrian competitions between the military and civilians must be held in various places in order to cultivate a national atmosphere of horse loving.</p>
<h3>Changning Police Bureau Strictly Prohibits the Sale of Black Market Tickets; Criminals Arrested and Sent to the District Prosecutor's Office for Punishment</h3>
<p>The Changning Road Police Sub-bureau of this city has paid close attention to "black market tickets" and black hats harassing passengers at the West Railway Station and has successively captured more than ten cases of illegal black hats. However, recently, a group of small vendors and women have mixed into the crowd, purchased tickets, and resold them at high prices for profit. When the bureau learned about this, it believed that the evacuation work was in progress and this kind of hindrance could not be allowed. Therefore, it secretly ordered an investigation and cracked down on several cases of Yang Xia, Weng Yingsheng, etc. After interrogation, they confessed to selling black market tickets for profit and were transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for strict handling.</p>
<h3>International Postal Remittances Limited</h3>

<h3>The Youth Movement in Manchukuo</h3>
<p>—Report by the Manchukuo Representative at Yesterday's懇談会 Meeting—</p>
<p>Manchukuo Youth Training Goals: Manchukuo representative Han Shutong yesterday delivered a report on the youth movement at the恳谈会 meeting, stating: "Regarding the youth movement in Manchukuo, the entire nation has paid considerable attention since the establishment of the country. In order to build the nation of the future, we must value the second generation of youth, therefore, special efforts have been made in youth activities since the founding of the country. In the twenty-sixth year of the Republic of China, which is the fourth year of Kangde, the government and the people jointly formulated the rules for youth training and began to implement them. Later, it was presided over by the unified organization of the Central Cooperative Society, and since then, youth activities have flourished. In the twenty-ninth year of the Republic of China, the labor force of the youth league was enormous, such as the construction of the Jinghe Line (Xinjing to Harbin), the Hada Road (Harbin to Dalian) and other road constructions, all of which were undertaken by the youth. Therefore, the other party attached great importance to the development of youth, and the National Labor Service Corps was established.</p>
<p>In terms of training, youth training can be carried out on a county-level basis, divided into training youth league members, re-training of members, cadre training, and even total discontinuity. As for the organization of the league, those from eleven to sixteen years old are the Young Pioneers, and those from sixteen to twenty-three years old are the Youth League, for both men and women. There is also the organization of the Youth Action Team, composed of outstanding members, whose task is to assist in maintaining public order, communicating intelligence, firefighting, air defense, etc. In addition, there are youth mechanical teams, chemical teams, marine teams, etc.</p>
<p>Overview of activities, production increase activities include reclaiming wasteland.</p>
<p>The Manchukuo youth movement was reported by the Manchukuo representative at yesterday's恳谈会 meeting. Afforestation, seed disinfection, soil manure transformation, etc., are all the work of the Junior League. There are also transportation of grain, anti-smoking campaigns and prevention activities, emergency rescue air defense, etc. There are also many cultural activities, as well as physical examinations, and the initiation of mountain climbing, etc. Therefore, the future training policy and educational goals are, first, to strengthen combat power, increase production, and develop industry. The second is to promote the national concept. In the future, every Manchurian citizen should cultivate the concept of the nation as the greater self of East Asia."</p>
<p>National Labor Service System: Yuan, the Director of the Manchukuo National Labor Service Corps Training Office, released the Labor Service System, stating: "Regarding the Manchukuo National Labor Service Corps, it is based on the youth as the main body, that is, starting from the youth. Its organization is from twenty-one to twenty-three years old, regardless of the people of the country, within this age range, those who have not yet become citizens, must participate in the Labor Service System. Therefore, labor service in Manchukuo is a national administration, promulgating the Labor Service Law, its system is implemented according to the needs of the current situation, to increase important industries for the group family, each person must do their best to implement it, which is also the duty that the citizens should fulfill. Although it is stipulated that several civil servants and those who serve important production can be exempted, it is necessary to observe that their service in this industry must be at least ten years above the appropriate age, before they can be allowed, otherwise, if they drop out halfway, they must still perform labor service, in order to prevent loopholes. Therefore, this system is implemented with the spirit of legislation, to make it the duty that citizens should advance. The service time is stipulated as eight hours of work per day, and all aspects of life, people are all willing to participate. Its organization is divided into platoons, squads, companies, and even large groups,展开ing in every township, cultivating from the township concept to the national concept.</p>
<p>As for the training of cadres, strict training is given every year, with the emphasis on regulating action discipline, with the aim of enabling them to exert guidance to the masses. At the same time, the consolidation of the cadres' thinking is emphasized, otherwise they must be re-trained, two or three times. Therefore, the current burden of Manchukuo on the Labor Service Corps is huge.</p>
<p>Regarding the organization of the Labor Service Corps, first, security must be consolidated, second, politics must be clean, third, household registration must be cleared, fourth, youth cadre training must have strict steps in advance, so the loyal and dutiful citizens of Manchukuo believe that this is the first success."</p>
