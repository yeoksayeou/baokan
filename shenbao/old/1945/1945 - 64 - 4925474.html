<h3>萊因羅爾兩河間　戰事達頂點　克萊斐爾熱巷戰中</h3>
<p>柏林四日中央社電　海通社訊：在哥許與烏爾夫特堤間活動之加第一軍。英第二軍及美第九軍合取攻勢，其目的爲截斷萊因左岸之全部領域，美第九軍在孟琛格拉特巴許區，向北及東北進攻，加第一軍向桑坦壓迫，英軍由文羅附近橋頭堡向吉爾登進攻，二十四小待內加第一軍在萊斯華爾特區向哥許桑坦鐵路進攻。總之，萊因爭奪雖未開始，萊因與羅爾間之戰事已達最高點。此一千方公里戰區內，大戰已歷九日，英軍自文羅向尼爾河平原及克萊斐爾特·吉爾登公路方面進攻。尼爾河之渡河戰，正於夜間猛烈進行，爲支援英軍作戰自南面於文羅及杜塞爾多夫之間進抵尼爾河，以堅强坦克隊自南及西進攻克萊斐爾特，該城南部已展開激烈巷戰。美第九軍接近紐斯，在該處正展開爭奪萊因河橋樑之戰，更南克里文布魯許正展開爭奪戰，柏興之東北德軍力阻敵軍之加深其突入點。加第一軍英第二軍及美第一軍與第九軍，在萊因·西法里亞工業區繼續猛攻，使用所有可資調遺之兵士坦克車戰砲及戰鬥機，但仍未能切斷德軍大隊與後方交通之聯絡而包圍之，德軍司令善用戰略，使敵軍雖獲極微之土地，必付重大代價。敵軍如欲渡萊因河，進窺德國魯爾區，非先消滅萊因西岸之德軍不可。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>嚴重的物價問題</h3>
<p>在平抑物價聲中，開春以來，物價的漲勢，似比前一時期更見猛烈。舊曆新正物價的騰貴，雖說與所謂週期性的上漲有關，但今年竟比往年愈甚，這尤爲當局正從事努力於壓低物價之際所不應有的畸形現象。恐怕不僅老百姓要大呌其苦，當局也必感到非常煩惱。</p>
<p>本市市政當局最近對於平抑物價，殫智竭慮，不能不說巳盡了最大的努力，而老百姓期待於當局之第一件迫切的事，也正是物價的低落，至少不要再脫韁似的狂漲上去；可是事實的發展，却跟當局的希望和老百姓的期待，適得其反。民生不得安定，戰力卽無從充分發揮，早爲各方所公認。物價問題的嚴重，其影響之巨，實巳母庸多加間釋了</p>
<p>除物資缺乏及通貨膨脹基本原因外，我們覺得下列三點實足以更加刺激一般物價的騰漲，卽：</p>
<p>（一）奸商不遵守限價，</p>
<p>（二）米價的高漲，</p>
<p>（三）公用事業的漲價。</p>
<p>限價跟黑市有着連鎖性，過去事實已一再有了證明，不幸又重見於今日。最近所定十六種重要物品限價，當局爲了顧全生產者及販賣者的成本和適當利潤，都比較提高，這不能算作不合理。然而限價一提高，黑市也馬上再高上一步，目前一部份限價物品，多無處可買，卽使買得到也非化極大力量不可。暴利者和奸商的藐視法令，自屬破壞限價的要因，不過另一方面新定限價物品，現在尙祇十六種。因此，其他不受新限價拘東的許多重要物品的漲價，也就難免打擊到限價物品的限價。</p>
<p>米價常是一般物價的領導者，所以我們認爲疏暢米糧來源，並作準期的配給，從而平抑米價，還是壓低物價中的最迫切的事。倘使米糧來源不能疏暢，米價仍有漲無跌，則一切所謂物價對策，都將屬於徒然，而隱伏於此的危機之深，也將難以想像。</p>
<p>公用事業的漲價，根據過去歷次經騐，也常爲刺激一般物價上漲的很大動力。三月一日起，本市都市交通公司，法商電車公司及內河輪船公司歌，又宣佈電車公共汽車船票的漲價，多漲上好幾倍。同時，華中電氣通信公司也宣告自三月一日起電話電報各漲價幾倍。華中鐵道公司則宜佈自三月五日起火車客貨票價運費，及所屬各錢長途汽車，都一律漲價，也是好幾倍。公用事業這樣幾倍幾倍的漲勢，其刺激一般物價的騰漲，猛烈程度當在想像之中。公用事業因開支浩大，爲維持事業的運營而漲價，雖屬不得已的事，但政府當局爲避免刺激物價太深，我們覺得由政府另行設法給興公用事業以經濟上的補助及各種助力，也非常必要。</p>
<p>總之，物價問題是整個經濟問題中的問題，枝枝節節的對策，斷難奏效，實非從整個經濟政策上作通盤打算不可。周市長所再三說過的市政府木身沒有物資，祗是「一雙空手」，因而「對於自然不可抗的原因所生的物價上漲，是束手無策」，我們十分了解而同情。我們現在要竭誠祈求不是一雙空手而有調度物資力量的各關係當局，對於當前因物價漫漲而產生的險惡現象，多加注意。</p>
<p>譯論</p>
<h3>中國物價問題　——朝日新聞二月十三日社評——</h3>
<p>在中國，尤其在華中地區，物價繼續飛漲。自去年十月初的中秋節直到年底止，在不足三個月的短期間內，業已暴騰三·四倍。及至今年舊曆年初，物價更起漲風，以致國民政府不得不斷然採取這次限制物價的措置，就此而觀，物價在漲的情形，當不難想像而知。</p>
<p>不問從保持民生安定及維持經濟秩序上言，或由貢獻戰力之觀點言，其對策實不容稍緩。中日有關當局已相繼由物質精神兩面實施物價對策，山强化金融統制。限制放出投機資金，徹底抉剔奸商，由放出回範物資以圖確保大量農產物；但不拘中日官民如何努力，物價依然繼續急騰，究爲何故？對於貨幣的發行，自須適度抑止。試觀華中與華北的物價，實相逕庭，而通貨發行的程度，亦復遲速不同，此足證明抑制的努力，大有關係。</p>
<p>物價因係政治。經濟一切要因集中的表現，所以第一非從政治方面確立强力的對策不可。無論有如何完全的法令，若不强力實行，終難期待事態的改善。今日即在國府方面亦難說巳經完全淘汰貪官污吏吧。在中國，物價問題巳可稱爲不能在經濟分野解決的政治問題，其故即在於此。我們認爲：肅正官邪，一新面目，確立廉潔政治，對使物價暴騰的社會環境，經濟條件加以斧鉞，實比任何事情更爲根本。而絕對强力實行業已決完的施策，尤爲中國物便問題的要諦。（吉譯）</p>
<h3>粤敵產一批　移交國府管理　華南敵產已全部移交</h3>
<p>廣州四日中央社電　廣州及汕頭地區內軍管之英美敵產四十二件，一日已移交國民政府，二十八日已將目錄交與廣東省政府，此事已由日大使館事務所發表：此次移管敵產多爲在廣州之舊英美人住宅地帶之敎會學校住宅等，至此華南日軍所管理之敵產，已完全移交國府管理。</p>
<h3>論三國會議</h3>
<p>英美蘇三頭會議，江表了總括約十項的共同公報。會議發起人，自然是羅斯福和邱吉爾，但這兩位難兄難弟又不得不僕僕風塵，萬里來會史太林，眞是一件滑稽事。三國共同公報，固屬是歐戰最後階段上反軸心國的軍事及政治文件，至於開誠佈公，坦懷相見，尙言之過早，目前因爲日德兩國，處於風雨飄搖之中，自然對於反軸心方面的政略及戰略，不要撲朔迷離，失去正確判斷力，而始終要以冷靜的頭腦，平心靜氣地賬陣以待，這就是我們當前迫切的課題。</p>
<p>在檢討公報時，應從兩個觀點來看。第一，英美蘇在歐洲政策上的尖銳對立，很有可能在三國共同戰綫上發生致命的裂痕。正爲了避免這一危險，才認爲有再來一次三頭會議的必要。第二，雖然三國間存在着政治上的明爭暗鬥，但三國始終堅持共同戰爭的基本立塲，爲貫徹戰爭大計，業已決定了共同的政治網領。</p>
<p>公報中開宗明義第一章，就談到三國對德軍事行動的調整，這是因爲赧顏於蘇軍大攻勢下的英美，很怕在對德戰爭的最後階段上，有不協調的事情發生。一般人認爲是三國眞誠合作與否的試金石之波蘭問題，也由於英美的讓步，而告一段落。關於南斯拉夫政權的解決方式，共產派的蒂托地位，也是毫未動搖。即歐洲問題焦點的處理德國問題，英美爲抑制蘇聯的單獨政治工作，而終於擬就三國共同的處理原則。對於「解放」歐洲的共同宣言，僅僅止於英美所喜數的「民主主義原則」字句，至於戰後歐洲各國國內政權的最後決定，毫無疑問，都將產生不亞於波闌問題的深刻糾紛。一切主要的解決方式，都本着蘇聯政治勢力的加强，和逐漸衰頹的英國之讓步，於是三國在歐洲才能保持暫時勢力的均衡，才能維持反德戰爭的合作。</p>
<p>然而，這種事實決非誇大三頭會談共同決議的意義。起碼可以說，只要三國不放棄反對德國的戰爭，就可以證明他們三國仍在合作着。因此，三國共同一致的對德策略，對於戰爭形勢上說，愈加危險萬分了。三國目前竟把根深蒂固的政治糾紛置於一傍，而想在世界戰爭的重要階段上取得勝利，這是我們軸心國家永矢無忘的一件事。自從戰爭的前半至後半，由於英美蘇不斷的外交努力和政治努力，竟數度古服了三國間的危機，而終於準備好了反軸心國的總攻擊陣勢。日德兩國處於這種形勢之下，應付此類敵人，應當如何努力，這是侮個國民要牢記心頭的。（林譯自二月十四日朝日新聞）。</p>

<h3>中央社改組　首次理事會</h3>
<p>中央電訊社爲國家唯一代表通訊機關，於國府還都時，應環境之需要而誕生，五年以來，在林前宣傳部長之督導及歷任社長之慘淡經營下，對和建國策眞諦曁大東亞戰爭意我之宣傳報道，盡其最大之勢力。際茲最後總力決勝階段，思想戰愈形銳化之時，爲完成其所員之重大使命起見，決定改組爲公益社團法人。發揮其眞正爲國家代表通訊社之性格，網羅中國新開協會會員報社爲社員，使其同負起社務，所有第一届理監事人選，業經宣傳部分別推定，定於今日（三月五日）在上海舉行第一次理事會。經此改組後，該社之立塲爲代表國家民族的，其對象爲全國報業全體的，立塲正確，對象分明，各方對該社今後負担國家通訊社之責任上，寄予最大之期待。</p>
<h3>常熱區舉行　保甲大會</h3>
<p>本市常熟保甲區，於昨日上午十時，在大興路上海大戲院舉行全體保甲大會，計到常熟分局局長于登雲，保甲王任松下實及全區各聯保長，保長，甲長，保甲人員等一千餘人，由保甲處長顧繼武致訓，行禮如儀后，由該區總聯保長姚義璋致開會詞，說明開會意義，繼即請顯處長訓話，大意謂：中國保甲制度，在數千年前即已普遍推行，藉以自治地方。北伐後，政府對於保甲工作曾多方設法推進，無如政局屢次演變，直至民十八年始重行推動，不久復有事變發生，國府還都後，租界收回，上海保甲工作，重起組織，推行以來，成績要然。吾人認爲保甲制度，是推行政治之基本根基，亦爲人民團結之原動力，上能協力政府，下則團結優秀份子，排除惡勢力之唯一機構，已成新興國家之主要工作，定能代表大時代前進之先導者，然保甲人員，應明瞭其本身之作務，努力奉公守法，爲民服務，應犧牲小我而求大我之精神，完成保甲之使命。繼請常熟分局局長于登雲，保甲主任等相繼致訓，當即開始討論對於戶籍登記，自警模範訓練，更換居住證及保甲任務等提案，結果頗爲圓滿，直至中午始行散會。</p>
<h3>本市上週間　工商各業市況　紊亂市情遏止物價平定</h3>
<p>滬市金融與工商各業市况，最近一週已漸見平穩，蓋以過去所傳流言均不足信，人心安定，市府有關當局澈查偵緝造謠份子及拘懲投機市儈後，牽亂市情頓形遏止，物價反見平落。</p>
<p>金融方面</p>
<p>粭赤初尚堅挺，週三以後，即見疲乏無神，價轉穩平，買風消戢，投機者羣以常局偵緝之嚴，不敢繼續蠢動，惟多頭尙不願吐售，致陪市金價未見平落，紋銀亦平淡無色。公債漲風，更難東山再起，華股萎疲不振，成交額減少，爲金融市情中最慘淡者，故一般人對股市均不抱樂觀，銀根似鬆中帶緊，乃銀錢業因農曆年節關係，一切業務尙未展開，故工商放款未發動前，各業需款甚急。</p>
<p>工商各業</p>

<h3>驚風駭浪中　僑聯克東華　三比二東華一球慘敗</h3>
<p>足球聯賽甲組，東華對僑聯之精彩節目，昨長十時起跑馬廳球塲舉行，球迷觀者頗衆。東華在驚風駭浪中，以二對三敗干僑聯，上半時各獲二球，九十分鐘戰程每分重均在搖蕩中，形成拉鋸之勢。東華防守綫顯見軟弱，前鋒有驚人演出，尤以戴麟經孫錦順爲嚴使人滿意，僑聯聯絡默契，頭頭是道，奧托尼洛鮑傑頗有好評。開始角逐，僑聯一鼓作氣，深入腹地，鮑傑近門力射，張邦綸措手不及，球應聲入綱，時離開寒僅十秒鐘，亦東華不祥之預兆。僑聯攻勢頗盛，越廿五分鐘，陳明哲獲球傳中，麥尼蒂躍起搶球，球雖在握，戴麟經乘其不備，將麥撞入球門，球直入網底，東華意外獲比一球，扳成平手。東華再接再厲，孫錦順截得來球，傳遞陳明哲，陳越羅旭萊而人，麥尼蒂情急衝出，陳射中空門，成二對一。距知好景不常，鐔禎福誤絆鮑傑，犯任意球，由西拉蒂操力，一蹴命巾，上半時各獲二球。再戰聲中，僑聯氣燄大熾，實華一度有好轉之勢，而僅曇花一現，後遂一蹶不振。未久泰克尼邊蹶起義，雄拉右降接應，莊友仁張林根漏洞失策，維拉空門得中，成三時二，東華力挽殘局，惜回天乏術，僑聯遂以三對二小敗東華。</p>

<h3>Thoroughly Maintain Military Discipline and Devote All Efforts to Replenishing Military Preparations: Army Minister Xiao Issues Policy Priorities</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 4th (Central News Agency) – The newly appointed Army Minister Xiao Shuyi recently made the following remarks to reporters: "Having been ordered to take up the post of Army Minister, and reflecting on my past service since the return to the capital, including serving as President of the Military Advisory Council and as Educational Director of the Central Army Officer Training Corps, I have fortunately avoided any major mishaps. Going forward, I will continue to uphold the legacy of the late Chairman Wang and work tirelessly under the guidance of Acting Chairman Chen to perfect the art of war. As an ancient Chinese saying goes, those in power should not talk too much. After assuming office, my policy priorities can be broadly divided into four areas: First, to rectify military administration. This point must be strictly enforced, and I hope that officers will closely monitor the discipline of their subordinates and thoroughly maintain military discipline. Second, to implement military education. To build an excellent army, it is necessary to instill excellent education. Military education directly affects the rectification of military discipline, and these two points are what I constantly bear in mind. Third, to replenish military preparations. The replenishment of military preparations has already been undertaken by special commissioners of the Ministry of the Army, and we will continue to strive to replenish military preparations as much as possible. Fourth, to strengthen the personnel of the Ministry. In the future, we will continue to recruit military talent to serve as the cornerstone of the national army."</p>
<h3>Ensuring Security in Jiangxi Province and Promoting the Exchange of Goods: Jiangxi Governor Huang Discusses Policy Guidelines</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 4th (Central News Agency) – The newly appointed Governor of Jiangxi Province and Director of the Jiujiang Pacification Office, Huang Ziqiang, met with reporters from the Central News Agency on the morning of the 4th and outlined his key policies for governing Jiangxi as follows:</p>
<p>"I am deeply honored to have received this important appointment from the Central Government to lead Jiangxi and oversee pacification and security matters. I am aware of my limited abilities and fear failure. I will dedicate myself to uphold the spirit of Acting Chairman Chen and Deputy Premier Zhou in working hard and struggling for the welfare of the people, strive to rectify government affairs, pacify the region, and bravely advance on the path of national revival and the defense of East Asia. Jiangxi is close to the front lines. For several years, banditry has not been quelled, and the wounds of war have not healed. Furthermore, finances and transportation are extremely difficult. These are undeniable facts. Today, when discussing governance and construction, we must prioritize and adopt a focused approach: (1) I plan to devote my full energy to improving the quality of officers and soldiers in the army, police, and security forces. Within the limits of available financial resources, I will do my best to improve their treatment and provide rigorous training, so that they can genuinely care for the people and seek their welfare, and gain the trust and support of the people. Only then can the military and civilians work together to achieve security and pacify the region. (2) Jiangxi is located in the central hub of the Yangtze River. In recent years, due to the lack of ships, transportation has been difficult, hindering the smooth exchange of goods with Wuhan in the upstream and Jiangsu and Anhui in the downstream. Within the financial capacity of the provincial government, I will do my best to facilitate shipping traffic between upstream and downstream and strive to develop transportation lines in the southeast, so that the Xiang-Gan, Yue-Gan, and Zhe-Gan routes can gradually become unimpeded. Land can then be fully utilized, and goods can flow freely, achieving the goals of increased production and stabilized livelihoods. (3) Other construction projects, prison work, and resettlement work will also be actively promoted, so as not to disappoint the central government's trust and the local people's expectations. However, I am aware of my limited talent and knowledge, and I hope that domestic talents and local elders will provide guidance so that all tasks can be completed and the goals of pacifying the region, reviving China, and defending East Asia can be realized. This would be fortunate not only for myself."</p>
<h3>B-29 Enemy Aircraft Attack Tokyo in Broad Daylight</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on the 4th: "From around 8:30 AM to 9:30 AM on the 4th, approximately 150 B-29 aircraft attacked, with Tokyo as their primary target. They indiscriminately bombed from high altitude, causing fires in several parts of the city, which were extinguished by around 10:30 AM."</p>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) – Observations from various sources suggest that the enemy appears to be adopting a new tactic of surprise attacks to achieve victory. The enemy's painstaking efforts are evident. The characteristics are as follows: (1) Exploiting adverse weather conditions; (2) Attempting the first midday bombing; (3) Using a small number of aircraft to cover their movements, hindering Japanese radar detection. Furthermore, attention is also being paid to the increase in the number of enemy aircraft.</p>
<h3>Japanese Forces on Luzon Island Continue to Fight Vigorously</h3>
<p>Luzon Front, 4th (Central News Agency) – Enemy forces repeatedly and stubbornly attacking Japanese strongholds east of Manila have suffered setbacks after being fiercely countered by Japanese forces. However, their fighting spirit seems to remain high, as they continue to reinforce their troops in an attempt to continue the attack. Approximately one division of enemy forces, under the cover of tanks, concentrated their attack near Antipolo since February 26th. Subsequently, after Japanese counterattacks and day-and-night advances, they suffered heavy losses, and their offensive was ultimately thwarted. Enemy forces in the Montalban area, where fierce fighting is ongoing, are currently actively transporting reinforcements, apparently deploying many military vehicles from San Miguel in the north. Another unit of enemy forces is moving south from Calumpang towards Santo Tomas, where Japanese forces are currently engaged in a fierce counterattack. At 9:30 AM on the 1st, enemy forces began landing on Lubang and Ulitico in Nasugbu Bay with over 70 naval transport vessels. Two enemy cruisers, one destroyer, seventeen transport ships, and other small craft are currently patrolling in Manila Bay.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Attack Shonan, Seventeen Shot Down</h3>
<p>Shonan, 4th (Central News Agency) – Fifty-four enemy B-29 aircraft attacked this area on the 2nd. The results of the engagement have now been verified, with seventeen of the aircraft shot down.</p>

<h3>Lady Mountbatten Visits Chongqing</h3>
<p>Macau, 4th (Central News Agency) – Haitong News Agency cites a Chongqing report: Lady Mountbatten, wife of the Supreme Commander of Southeast Asia, Lord Mountbatten, has arrived in Chongqing from India for a visit.</p>
<h3>Japanese Forces Hold Various Strong Fortifications: Fierce Hand-to-Hand Combat Unfolds on Iwo Jima, Enemy Offensive Suffers Major Setbacks</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) – Japanese forces on Iwo Jima have overcome various adverse conditions and are holding Mount Osaka, Mount Tamanawa, and other strong fortifications, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. The results of the battles on March 1st and 2nd are as follows: 1,700 personnel killed or wounded, thirteen tanks disabled or burned, one flamethrower destroyed, and three aircraft shot down.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) – Enemy forces on Iwo Jima have recently advanced from the Motoyama area to near the northwestern part of the North Airfield. On the morning of the 3rd, under the cover of intense artillery fire, they launched another attack on the Japanese forces in the northern sector. Japanese units in that area are currently engaged in fierce combat with them. Furthermore, enemy forces have launched several attacks on the Asa area since the 2nd, but have been repelled by Japanese tank units. On the evening of the same day, enemy forces approached Japanese positions with a dozen tanks, and the two armies engaged in hand-to-hand combat. Three enemy tanks were destroyed in this battle, and a large number of infantry were killed or wounded, causing a major setback to the enemy offensive. The fighting in the Mount Osaka area remains extremely fierce, inflicting heavy damage on the approaching enemy. However, the enemy is continuing to increase its forces and is using flamethrowers, making the situation in that area even more critical. Japanese forces are still holding key positions, and their morale is extremely high. Enemy forces in the Nidankama area have also begun to press on Japanese positions, and fierce fighting has broken out since dawn on the 2nd, finally cutting off contact at noon. Enemy forces have also attacked Japanese strongholds in the southern village with several tanks and flamethrowers, but have been repelled each time, and the Japanese forces are still holding their positions. There has been no significant activity by enemy forces in the Mount Tamanawa area, so the front line remains stable.</p>
<h3>War Situation in Various Parts of Greater East Asia This Past Week</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) – The war situation in various parts of Greater East Asia this past week is as follows:</p>
<p>Iwo Jima, Ogasawara Islands</p>
<p>Since the enemy landed on Iwo Jima on February 19th, they have surrounded the island with 20 to 30 large and medium-sized ships and approximately 100 transport ships, subjecting it to naval bombardment of between 7,000 and 8,000 rounds per day. They have also launched air raids from 200 to 800 carrier-based aircraft, and under this air superiority, enemy forces, with tanks and black troops as their vanguard, are conducting a strong and forceful advance. Japanese forces are fighting bravely everywhere. The Japanese forces on Mount Suribachi, having exhausted their ammunition, are still fighting bravely, forcefully breaking through the enemy lines, joining up with the main Japanese force in the north, and launching suicide attacks in various places, attempting to blow up enemy positions, killing and wounding enemy personnel, and inflicting considerable damage on the enemy. As of the end of this week, the enemy has successfully broken through the center of the Japanese first line in the Motoyama area, penetrating Japanese positions and engaging in fierce combat. On the Ogasawara Islands, the enemy continues to launch air raids on other Japanese bases, using carrier-based aircraft by day and large aircraft by night.</p>
<p>Taiwan and the Philippines</p>
<p>The most intense fighting is taking place in the old city district of Manila. The enemy is conducting artillery and bombing raids day and night, and the city has now been reduced to rubble. Four hundred enemy medium and small aircraft from Lingayen and San Fabian have raided Taiwan's central and southern regions in coordination with B-24 and other large aircraft. A recent characteristic is the carpet bombing of non-military facilities by formations of large aircraft, and persistent raids by a small number of aircraft at night. The submarine units in the Mindanao and Celebes Seas are actively disrupting enemy supply lines. On the morning of the 28th, they torpedoed and sank a large enemy transport ship in the Lingayen Gulf, constantly posing a threat to the enemy. In response, the enemy is carrying out landings on small, seemingly uninhabited islands in various places, frantically securing safe routes within the Philippine Islands. At the end of February, enemy special forces landed on the Kure, Sorsogon, and Toboso areas, and fierce fighting is taking place everywhere. A small number of enemy ships have intruded into Manila Bay.</p>
<p>Burma</p>
<p>"Northern Burma Region": The enemy's 1st Army is gradually advancing from the area northeast of Lashio to the south of Se-U, and the enemy's 50th Division is advancing from the area southwest of Namhpatka, 20 kilometers northwest of Lashio. Japanese forces are consolidating their positions in the area around Lashio. Japanese units in the Nanhpaka area are reorganizing their lines north of Lashio in preparation for defending against the enemy's advance. "Momeik Region": Japanese units in the Momeik area annihilated the British-Indian 36th Division near Myitson, north of Momeik, and are pressing on the Seeli River. "Irrawaddy River Region": Enemy units of the British-Indian 5th Division, under the cover of powerful armored units, invaded the area south of Monte, along the Irrawaddy River near Nyangu, southwest of Pauk, on the 27th, in front of Meiktila, a key point south of Monte. Japanese units are bravely engaging the enemy, and fierce fighting is taking place in the surrounding area. Furthermore, Japanese units south of Pauk are pressing and attacking the enemy's East Asia 11th Division on the west bank of the Irrawaddy River since the 20th. "Arakan Region": The enemy's West Africa 81st Division, advancing south from Kyauktaw, invaded the area 10 kilometers north of Tamaanhta on the 21st. The enemy landing south of Maungdaw is increasing its forces. Japanese forces are resolutely counterattacking the enemy on both fronts.</p>
<p>Southwest Islands</p>
<p>On the 1st, enemy carrier-based aircraft from a mobile task force attacked in waves, with 780 aircraft. It appears that the enemy mobile task force is cruising in nearby waters.</p>
<h3>British Imperial Conference to Be Convened at the Beginning of Next Month</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 4th (Central News Agency) – Haitong News Agency cites news from London that Britain will convene an Imperial "family discussion" at the beginning of April to prepare for the San Francisco Conference.

<p>Stockholm, 4th (Central News Agency) – Haitong News Agency reports: In addition to Foreign Secretary Eden and Deputy Prime Minister Attlee, the list of other British representatives to the San Francisco Conference has not yet been released.

<p>Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) – Haitong News Agency reports: The All-India Committee of Free Nations in the United States is preparing to attend the San Francisco Conference informally. The committee has already sent excerpts to the heads of various delegations and the chairman of the conference.</p>
<h3>Gu Weijun Returns to Chongqing</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from Chongqing: The ambassador to Britain, Gu Weijun, has returned to Chongqing after two years of absence to discuss important matters with the Chongqing government authorities.</p>
<h3>Finnish Government Decides to Declare War on Germany</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 4th (Central News Agency) – According to Haitong News Agency: The "Svenska Dagbladet" correspondent in Helsinki reports that the Finnish government has decided to declare war on Germany.</p>
<h3>Soviet Forces on the Eastern Front Prepare to Launch New Offensive</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 4th (Central News Agency) – Haitong News Agency reports: Reuters correspondent in Moscow, Hugh Baillie, says that after several weeks of deployment, Marshals Zhukov and Konev of the Soviet Eastern Front are about to begin a major offensive between the Warthe River and the Neisse River.</p>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency) – Haitong News Agency reports: The focus of the Eastern Front is still on the northern wing of Stettin. After breaking through near Landsberg and entering Western Pomerania, the Soviet forces are now attempting to advance westward towards Stargard, but their attempts to advance in the past 24 hours have been thwarted.</p>
<h3>Fighting Between the Rhine and Roer Rivers Reaches Its Peak, Street Fighting in Kleve</h3>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency) – Haitong News Agency reports: The Canadian 1st Army, British 2nd Army, and U.S. 9th Army operating between Goch and Xanten are launching an offensive aimed at cutting off the entire territory on the left bank of the Rhine. The U.S. 9th Army is attacking north and northeast in the Mönchengladbach area. The Canadian 1st Army is pressing towards Xanten, and the British Army is advancing from the bridgehead near Venlo towards Geldern. In the past 24 hours, the Canadian 1st Army has advanced towards the Goch-Xanten railway in the Rees-Waal district. In short, although the battle for the Rhine has not yet begun, the fighting between the Rhine and Roer rivers has reached its peak. In this 1,000-square-kilometer war zone, the battle has been going on for nine days. The British Army is advancing from Venlo towards the Niers River plain and the Kleve-Geldern highway. The river crossing battle is raging fiercely at night. To support the British Army's operations, strong tank units have advanced from the south between Venlo and Düsseldorf to reach the Niers River, attacking Kleve from the south and west. Fierce street fighting has broken out in the southern part of the city. The U.S. 9th Army is approaching Neuss, where the battle for the Rhine River bridge is underway. Further south, the battle for Krefeld is raging. Northeast of Beringen, German forces are resisting the enemy's attempts to deepen their penetration. The Canadian 1st Army, British 2nd Army, and U.S. 1st and 9th Armies are continuing their fierce attacks in the Rhine-Westphalia industrial area, using all available soldiers, tanks, artillery, and fighter planes, but have still failed to cut off the communication between the main German force and the rear and encircle it. The German commander is making good use of strategy, forcing the enemy to pay a heavy price for even the smallest piece of land gained. If the enemy wants to cross the Rhine River and invade Germany's Ruhr region, they must first eliminate the German forces on the west bank of the Rhine.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Serious Problem of Prices</h3>
<p>Amidst the calls for stabilizing prices, the rise in prices since the beginning of the spring seems to be even more fierce than in the previous period. Although the price increases during the Lunar New Year are said to be related to the so-called cyclical increases, this year is even worse than in previous years, which is an abnormal phenomenon that should not have occurred when the authorities are working hard to lower prices. I am afraid that not only will the common people be greatly distressed, but the authorities will also feel very troubled.</p>
<p>The municipal authorities in this city have recently been racking their brains to stabilize prices and have to be said to have done their best. The first urgent thing that the common people expect from the authorities is the drop in prices, at least not to rise wildly like a runaway horse. However, the development of the facts is contrary to the hopes of the authorities and the expectations of the people. It has long been recognized by all parties that without stable people's livelihood, combat power cannot be fully exerted. The seriousness of the price problem and its huge impact has already made needless to mention.</p>
<p>In addition to the basic causes of material shortages and currency inflation, we feel that the following three points are sufficient to further stimulate the rise in general prices, namely:</p>
<p>(1) Unscrupulous merchants do not comply with price limits,</p>
<p>(2) High rice prices,</p>
<p>(3) Rising public utility prices.</p>
<p>Price limits are linked to the black market, as past facts have repeatedly proven, and unfortunately it is happening again today. The recently set price limits for sixteen important items have been increased to take into account the costs and appropriate profits of producers and sellers, which cannot be considered unreasonable. However, as soon as the price limit is raised, the black market will immediately take another step higher. Currently, most of the price-limited items cannot be bought anywhere, even if they can be bought, it takes a lot of effort. The disregard for laws by profiteers and unscrupulous merchants is a factor that destroys price limits. However, on the other hand, there are currently only sixteen newly priced items. Therefore, the price increases of many other important items that are not bound by the new price limits are bound to hit the price limits of price-limited items.</p>
<p>Rice prices are often the leaders of general prices, so we believe that dredging the source of rice and grain, and providing punctual distribution, thereby stabilizing rice prices, is still the most urgent thing to lower prices. If the source of rice and grain cannot be dredged and rice prices still rise without falling, then all so-called price countermeasures will be in vain, and the depth of the crisis hidden here will be difficult to imagine.</p>
<p>Based on past experiences, rising public utility prices are often a major driving force for stimulating general price increases. From March 1st, the city's urban transportation company, the French tram company, and the inland river shipping company announced price increases for tram, bus, and boat tickets, many of which increased by several times. At the same time, China Electric Communications Company also announced that telephone and telegram prices would increase several times from March 1st. China Railway Company announced that from March 5th, train passenger and freight ticket prices and the long-distance bus fares of its affiliated bus lines would all increase, also by several times. The surge of public utility prices by several times will be more than enough to stimulate the rise of general prices. Although public utilities are increasing prices due to huge expenses in order to maintain the operation of the business, which is a last resort, we feel that it is also very necessary for the government authorities to find other ways to provide economic subsidies and various assistance to public utilities in order to avoid stimulating prices too deeply.</p>
<p>In short, the price problem is the problem within the entire economic problem, and piecemeal countermeasures will be difficult to be effective. It is really necessary to make an overall plan from the entire economic policy. We fully understand and sympathize with Mayor Zhou's repeated statement that the municipal government itself has no resources, only "a pair of empty hands," and therefore is "helpless in the face of price increases caused by natural and irresistible reasons." We now sincerely pray that the relevant authorities who are not a pair of empty hands but have the power to mobilize resources will pay more attention to the dangerous phenomena caused by the rampant rise in prices.</p>

<h3>The Chinese Price Problem - Asahi Shimbun February 13 Editorial -</h3>
<p>In China, especially in the central China region, prices continue to skyrocket. From the Mid-Autumn Festival in early October of last year until the end of the year, prices have surged three or four times in less than three months. As for the beginning of the Lunar New Year this year, prices have risen even higher, so that the Nationalist government had to resolutely take this measure to limit prices. From this, it is not difficult to imagine the situation of rising prices.</p>
<p>Whether from the point of view of maintaining people's livelihood and stabilizing economic order, or from the point of view of contributing to combat power, countermeasures should not be delayed. The Chinese and Japanese authorities concerned have successively implemented price countermeasures from both material and spiritual aspects, and have strengthened financial controls, restricted the release of speculative funds, thoroughly rooted out unscrupulous merchants, and released recovered materials in order to ensure a large number of agricultural products; but no matter how hard the Chinese and Japanese officials and civilians try, prices continue to rise rapidly, why is this? The issuance of currency must be moderately restrained. Looking at the prices in central China and northern China, they are very different, and the degree of currency issuance is also different in speed. This is enough to prove that the efforts to suppress them are very important.</p>
<p>Because price is the concentrated expression of all political and economic factors, it is imperative to establish a strong countermeasure from the political aspect first. No matter how complete the laws are, if they are not strongly implemented, it will be difficult to expect the situation to improve. Even on the Kuomintang side today, it is difficult to say that corrupt officials have been completely eliminated. In China, the price problem can be said to be a political problem that cannot be solved in the economic field, and this is the reason. We believe that correcting official corruption, making a fresh start, and establishing honest politics are more fundamental than anything else to address the social environment and economic conditions that have caused prices to skyrocket. It is essential to carry out with absolute strength the measures that have already been decided, and this is the key to the Chinese price problem. (Translated by Ji)</p>
<h3>Enemy Assets in Guangdong Transferred to National Government Management; All Enemy Assets in South China Now Transferred</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Forty-two British and American enemy properties under military control in the Guangzhou and Shantou areas were transferred to the National Government on the 1st. The catalog was handed over to the Guangdong Provincial Government on the 28th. This matter has been announced by the Japanese Embassy Office. Most of the enemy assets transferred this time are churches, schools, and residences located in the former British and American residential areas of Guangzhou. With this transfer, all enemy assets managed by the Japanese military in South China have been completely transferred to the National Government.</p>
<h3>On the Three-Power Conference</h3>
<p>The Three-Power Conference of Britain, America, and the Soviet Union concluded with a joint communiqué covering approximately ten items. The initiators of the conference were naturally Roosevelt and Churchill, but these two ill-fated companions had to travel great distances to meet Stalin, which is quite a comical situation. The joint communiqué of the three powers is indeed a military and political document of the anti-Axis powers in the final stage of the European war. However, it is too early to speak of openness and frankness. Currently, with Germany and Japan in a precarious situation, it is natural that the political and strategic approaches of the anti-Axis side must not be confusing and lose their correct judgment. Instead, they must always maintain a calm mind and patiently wait for the opportunity. This is the urgent task before us.</p>
<p>When reviewing the communiqué, it should be viewed from two perspectives. First, the sharp conflict between Britain, America, and the Soviet Union on European policy has the potential to create a fatal rift in the common front of the three powers. It was precisely to avoid this danger that it was deemed necessary to have another Three-Power Conference. Second, although there is open and covert political struggle among the three powers, they have always adhered to the basic position of a joint war. To implement the overall war plan, they have already decided on a common political outline.</p>
<p>The first chapter of the communiqué explicitly addresses the coordination of military actions by the three powers against Germany. This is because Britain and America, embarrassed by the Soviet Union's major offensive, are very afraid of uncoordinated events occurring in the final stage of the war against Germany. The Polish issue, which is generally regarded as the touchstone of whether the three powers are sincerely cooperating, has also come to an end due to concessions by Britain and America. Regarding the solution to the Yugoslav regime, the position of Tito, a communist leader, remains unshaken. Even in dealing with the German question, the focus of European issues, Britain and America, in order to contain the Soviet Union's independent political work, have finally drafted common handling principles for the three powers. The joint declaration on the "liberation" of Europe only extends to the "democratic principles" favored by Britain and America. As for the final decision on the domestic regimes of various European countries after the war, there is no doubt that they will generate profound disputes no less than the Polish issue. All major solutions are based on the strengthening of Soviet political power and the gradual concession of a declining Britain. Thus, the three powers can maintain a temporary balance of power in Europe and maintain cooperation in the anti-German war.</p>
<p>However, this fact does not exaggerate the significance of the joint resolutions of the Three-Power Conference. At least, it can be said that as long as the three powers do not abandon the war against Germany, it can prove that they are still cooperating. Therefore, the three powers' unified strategy against Germany is becoming increasingly dangerous in terms of the war situation. The fact that the three powers are currently putting aside deep-rooted political disputes and seeking to achieve victory in the important stage of the world war is something that our Axis countries will never forget. From the first half to the second half of the war, due to the continuous diplomatic and political efforts of Britain, America, and the Soviet Union, they have repeatedly overcome the crises among the three powers and finally prepared for the overall offensive posture against the Axis powers. Under this situation, how Germany and Japan should deal with such enemies is something that every citizen must keep in mind. (Translated by Lin from the Asahi Shimbun, February 14th).</p>

<h3>News Association and Shanghai Branch Host Ambassador Tsuchida; Guests and Hosts Exchange Cooperative Remarks During the Banquet</h3>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the China News Association, in conjunction with Tongguo on Taishan Road, held a joint banquet yesterday afternoon at 6:00 PM in honor of Ambassador Tsuchida. In addition to Ambassador Tsuchida, the guests included Counselor Okazaki from the Embassy, Counselor Sato, Investigator Ikenaga, Information Department Director Matsudaira, Secretary Nakata, Vice Consul Fukuma, and Vice Consul Maeda. The hosts included Li Sihao, Chen Bin Yan, Chen Ri Ping, Xu Liqiu, Jin Xiong Bai, Osako Yoichi, Huang Jing Fen, Lu Feng, Hidaka, and Zhang Zhao Ming.</p>
<p>Chen Bin He's Speech</p>
<p>During the banquet, Chen Bin He rose to deliver a welcome speech, briefly stating: Since the Shanghai News Federation reorganized and established the Shanghai branch of the China News Association, all work has progressed smoothly. Shanghai's newspapers originally occupied an important position in the Chinese news industry. In recent years, although the newspapers have not achieved much in their business, their spirit of cooperation can be described as unprecedented. Now that the war is becoming increasingly serious, the responsibility of our news industry is becoming even greater. We hope that the Allied authorities will provide more guidance and cooperation in the future.</p>
<p>Tsuchida's Reply</p>
<p>Subsequently, Ambassador Tsuchida delivered a reply speech, briefly stating: The leaders of the Shanghai newspapers that constitute the China News Association are not only leaders in the Chinese news industry, but also influential figures in the economic and cultural circles. Therefore, they have made great contributions to all undertakings in Chinese society. Therefore, Japan is willing to do its utmost to assist the development of the Chinese press in all aspects, and hopes that everyone will work even harder. The guests and hosts parted joyfully at around 9:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Reorganization of Central News Agency; First Board Meeting</h3>
<p>The Central News Agency, as the only national representative news agency, was born in response to the needs of the environment when the National Government returned to the capital. For five years, under the guidance of former Minister of Propaganda Lin and the dedicated management of successive presidents, it has made its greatest efforts to promote and report on the true meaning of the national construction policy and the Greater East Asia War. At this time, when the final decisive battle stage is approaching and the ideological warfare is becoming increasingly acute, in order to fulfill its important mission, it has been decided to reorganize it into a public interest corporation, to exert its true character as a national representative news agency, and to enlist member newspapers of the China News Association as members, so that they can jointly shoulder the affairs of the agency. All the candidates for the first board of directors and supervisors have been separately nominated by the Propaganda Department and are scheduled to hold their first board meeting in Shanghai today (March 5). After this reorganization, the agency's position will be representative of the nation and its target will be the entire national newspaper industry. With a clear position and a clear target, all parties place the greatest expectations on the agency's future responsibility as a national news agency.</p>
<h3>Changshu District Holds Baojia General Assembly</h3>
<p>The Changshu Baojia District of this city held a general assembly of all Baojia yesterday morning at 10:00 AM at the Shanghai Grand Theatre on Daxing Road. Those in attendance included Yu Dengyun, director of the Changshu Branch Bureau, Baojia Wang Renzheng, and more than 1,000 people including the heads of all Lianbao, Bao heads, Jia heads, and Baojia personnel in the district. After Director Gu Jiwu of the Baojia Office gave instructions and the ceremonial rites were performed, Yao Yizhang, the head of the district's General Lianbao, delivered an opening speech, explaining the significance of the meeting. Then, Director Xian was invited to give a speech, the general idea being: The Chinese Baojia system has been widely implemented for thousands of years to govern the local area. After the Northern Expedition, the government tried in many ways to promote the Baojia work. However, the political situation changed repeatedly. It was not until the 18th year of the Republic that it was promoted again. Soon after, incidents occurred again. After the National Government returned to the capital and the concessions were recovered, Shanghai's Baojia work was reorganized. Since its implementation, the results have been obvious. We believe that the Baojia system is the basic foundation for promoting politics and the driving force for people's unity. It is the only organization that can cooperate with the government above and unite outstanding elements and eliminate evil forces below. It has become the main work of the emerging country and will surely represent the pioneer of the great era. However, Baojia personnel should understand their own duties, work diligently and abide by the law, serve the people, sacrifice the small self to seek the big self, and complete the mission of Baojia. Then, Yu Dengyun, director of the Changshu Branch Bureau, and the Baojia director successively gave instructions. Immediately, discussions began on proposals such as household registration, self-defense model training, replacement of residence permits, and Baojia tasks. The results were quite satisfactory. The meeting adjourned at noon.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Market Conditions for Industry and Commerce Last Week: Curbing Market Chaos and Stabilizing Prices</h3>
<p>The market conditions for Shanghai's finance, industry, and commerce have gradually stabilized in the past week. This is because the rumors that have been circulating in the past are not credible, people's minds are at ease, and the relevant authorities of the municipal government have thoroughly investigated and apprehended rumor-mongers and detained and punished speculative merchants. After that, the market chaos has been curbed, and prices have fallen instead.</p>
<p>Financial Aspects</p>
<p>The dollar was initially strong, but after Wednesday, it became weak and listless, and the price became stable and flat. The buying trend disappeared, and speculators did not dare to continue to act recklessly due to the strict investigation by the Standing Bureau. However, the bulls were still unwilling to sell, so the gold price in the escort market did not fall, and silver was also plain and colorless. The wave of rising public debt is even more difficult to make a comeback, and Chinese stocks are sluggish, with a decrease in trading volume, which is the most dismal situation in the financial market. Therefore, the general public is not optimistic about the stock market. Credit seems to be tight in the midst of looseness. This is because the silver and money industries have not yet started all business due to the Lunar New Year holiday. Therefore, before industrial and commercial lending is launched, all industries are in urgent need of funds.</p>
<p>Industry and Commerce</p>
<p>The situation in industry and commerce in the past week has also been unremarkable due to the above reasons. Most factories are suspended due to raw materials and electricity. Commercial stores are idle. The increase in the price of various major items is due to the government's policy of suppressing and stabilizing prices, which is being actively implemented by the relevant economic agencies in accordance with the newly limited prices approved recently, which is quite serious. In particular, the low-priced rice of industrial and commercial groups handled by the Municipal Standing Bureau has begun to be distributed in the first phase, and the second phase has been paid, and it will continue to be distributed soon. Therefore, people's food is gradually stable, and the wave of rising rice prices in the black market has also subsided slightly. And it automatically fell from Thursday last week, and the rise in the market price of food and miscellaneous grains also stopped.</p>
<p>Daily Necessities</p>
<p>Vegetable prices have fallen across the board, which should be attributed to the government's efforts to suppress and stabilize prices. The general public expects the authorities to make unremitting efforts to dredge the source, so that after the supply and demand of materials is fully balanced, there will be no more price increases.</p>
<h3>Municipal Police Bureau Mass Layoffs</h3>
<p>In order to thoroughly strengthen the security forces and increase work efficiency, the Municipal Police Bureau has made major reforms to police administration and adjusted personnel. It is reported that the bureau has improved the treatment and the problem of layoffs has started from the branches, bureaus, and teams. After careful review, redundant personnel who are usually ineffective, have weak abilities, have poor character, and are unqualified in age have been dismissed. A total of more than 2,000 people were announced the day before yesterday, including police officers, detectives, investigators, and police officers. Appropriate severance pay is given based on their length of service. As for the redundant personnel in the head office, the review is also underway.</p>
<h3>Cadre School for Countryside Clearing Enrolling Second Class</h3>

<h3>Amidst Stormy Waves, Qiaolian Defeats Donghua; Donghua Suffers a Miserable 3-2 Defeat by One Goal</h3>
<p>The exciting program of Donghua versus Qiaolian in the First Division of the Football League was held at the Racecourse Field starting at 10:00 AM yesterday. Many fans watched. Donghua lost to Qiaolian 3-2 in the stormy waves. Each team scored two goals in the first half. Every minute of the 90-minute game was spent in turmoil, forming a seesaw battle. Donghua's defense line was obviously weak, and the forwards had amazing performances, especially Dai Linjing and Sun Jinshun, who were very satisfactory. Qiaolian's coordination was tacit and methodical. Ottonilo Baoger was well received. At the start of the competition, Qiaolian took a breath and penetrated deep into the hinterland. Baoger shot near the goal, and Zhang Banglun was caught off guard. The ball went into the net in response, only ten seconds away from the start, which was also an ominous sign for Donghua. Qiaolian's offensive was very strong. After 25 minutes, Chen Mingzhe got the ball and crossed it. McNiti jumped up to grab the ball. Although the ball was in his hands, Dai Linjing took advantage of his unpreparedness and bumped McNiti into the goal. The ball went straight into the net, and Donghua unexpectedly scored a goal to tie the score. Donghua continued to work hard, Sun Jinshun intercepted the ball, passed it to Chen Mingzhe, Chen crossed Luo Xulai, and McNiti rushed out in a hurry, Chen shot into the empty goal, making it 2-1. Not far away, the good times did not last long. Xin Zhenfu accidentally tripped Baoger, committing a free kick. Sirati took the shot with force, hitting the mark in one fell swoop. Each team scored two goals in the first half. In the midst of the second battle, Qiaolian's arrogance was blazing. Shi Hua once had a turnaround, but it was only a flash in the pan, and then it was never the same. Before long, Techney rose up from the sidelines, Xiong pulled down the right to respond, Zhuang Youren and Zhang Lingen made mistakes, and Villa scored in the empty goal, making it 3-2. Donghua tried to save the situation, but unfortunately it was powerless. Qiaolian then narrowly defeated Donghua 3-2.</p>
<p>Qiaolian: McNiti, Luo Xulai, Sirati, Bolini, Ottonilo, Xueweitai, Luokeni, Yatuomali, Bama, Baoger, Villa.</p>
<p>Donghua: Zhang Banglun, Li Ning, Zhuang Youren, Liang Shutang, Xin Fuzhen, Zhang Lingen, Li Yao, Sun Jinshun, Dai Linjing, Jia Youliang, Chen Mingzhe.</p>

<h3>General Office of the Military Commission's Opium Suppression Supervisor - Regulations for the Prohibition of Opium Paste Merchants</h3>
<p>Following the establishment of the General Office of the Military Commission's Opium Suppression Supervisor, the internal adjustments of the subordinate General Opium Suppression Bureau and local opium suppression bureaus have been completed. Continuing the original policy, the three-year plan for complete prohibition from March 30, 1944, to March 29, 1947, will be implemented. This involves strictly enforcing the registration of opium addicts and setting deadlines for gradual abstinence. Morphine, heroin, red pills, and other narcotics are absolutely prohibited. The regulations for the prohibition of opium paste merchants have also been announced and implemented. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
