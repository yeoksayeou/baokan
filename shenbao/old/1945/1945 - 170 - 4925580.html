<h3>冲繩島南部尻地區日軍築縱深陣地　航空部隊再度急襲敵機塲</h3>
<p>東京十八日中央社電　冲繩本島南部島尻地區日軍，於具志頭·富盬·世名城·系滿各地區丘陵地帶構築縱深陣地，士氣激昂，繼續奮戰。敵軍因獲得援軍部隊，陣容一新，第七·第九·十六·海軍第一師等三師團，於最前綫反覆猛攻，更企圖由具志頭·富盛正面攻入日軍防禦陣地，以期一舉而決定大勢，該方面戰鬥熾烈已極，日軍之冲繩本島核心陣地首里至那霸一帶，於五月底發生硬驅綻以來，業經二旬，日守備部隊於整然態勢下，奮戰勇鬥，使敵軍之流血逐日增大。六月初至十日止，業以殺傷敵兵二萬以上，若自敵軍登陸以來計算，已達七萬三千五百餘名，日軍此種不屈不撓之反攻，實出乎敵軍之意外。於是敵海上艦艇乃再開始掩護砲擊及轟炸，日守備軍處此烈巳極之戰况下，益發揮其固有眞髓，抑止敵軍轉移次期作戰。同時，小祿方面之日軍部隊，雖陷入敵海兵六師團重圍，然仍實行挺身肉博，衝入敵陣，使敵兵不寒而慄。</p>
<p>琉球羣島基地十八日中央社電　日航空隊十七日晨急襲冲繩本島之敵機塲，投下必中彈，使其數處爆炸起火，敵於茲數日來，為呼應陸上作戰，乃以巡洋艦及其他小型艦艇，砲擊冲繩本島南端之日軍陣地。又十七日對列島一帶來襲之敵機，約在二百架。</p>
<h3>對空挺部隊戰鬥要領日陸軍當局印就分發</h3>
<p>東京十八日中央社電　日陸軍省敎育總監部，以本土一朝成為決戰塲時，首先可預想者，即敵夫軍之慣技，必先用運輸機裝運兵員及武器之空挺部隊强行降陸，關於此點，日軍與國民義勇隊應如何作戰，茲巳印就對於空挺部隊戰鬥要領之簡明　解傳單，遍分與全國各關係方面。</p>
<p>東京十八日中央社電　敵軍自太平洋開始侵攻作戰，於瓜達加納爾展開登陸作戰後，終至進展至冲繩作戰，其間敵軍損失慘重，創戰史空前紀錄，現敵方因一時達成其作戰目的，似頗對日本土登陸作戰抱有樂觀，然此次冲繩作戰，已使敵方樂觀論調完全破碎，蓋敵方不利各點如次：敵艦船羣損失慘重，其海軍兵力保有量三分之一以上，業彼日軍擊毀，其基礎海軍兵力之二分之一左右，已陷於不能使用之狀態。因之，敵展開慣技之登陸作戰時，欲期於此次冲繩作戰急速獲得局地航空兵力絕對優勢，乃陷入困難狀態，且當下期作戰亦必須大量使用基地空軍以代替空母，航空勢力作戰，亦蒙相當威脅，因是美軍乃實施以基地空軍為主，前未曾見之航空攻擊，採取强烈空戰戰術，而冲繩作戰，同時亦予日本以繼然於本土擊滅敵軍登陸企圖之確信，且敵軍於冲繩作戰中，已飽嘗日軍特攻隊威力，無受有相當打擊，今後相當方策制止日軍此種若特攻戰術，則其機動部隊決無進出可能。冲繩作戰之日軍威力，不僅使敵軍對日本本土登陸作戰極為愼重，吾人愈益深信日方可獲得最後勝利。</p>
<h3>蘇門答臘住民加入特攻隊</h3>
<p>蘇門答臘基地十八日中央社電　日軍特攻隊之壯烈肉搏精神，業巳深印蘇門答臘住民腦中，放映電影時「特攻」之文字一發現，全體觀衆即不期而同，同時起立，表示感　激心理與熱望建設蘇門答臘之當地靑年以莫大感銘，且最近均志願加入蘇門答臘特攻隊，向義勇軍及義勇軍後援隊投送奮勇志願書者，陸續不絕，現巳達一千數百名。</p>
<h3>中央及軍委會舉行紀念週</h3>
<p>南京十八日中央社電　中央黨部十八日上午十時，在該部大禮堂舉行第二五四次總理紀念週，到中央執監委員，各廳部會工作同志，政府機關國民黨黨員六百餘人，由副秘書長戴策主席，行禮如儀後，委員周化人報吿「對共的認識」，歷一小時，至為詳盡，至十一時許禮成散會。</p>
<p>南京十八日中央社電　軍事委員會及軍令部，十八日上午九時舉行總楊振氏任主席，領導全體職員，行禮如儀，歷半小時始散。</p>
<h3>日載仁親王昨舉行國葬</h3>
<p>東京十八日中央社電　故元帥陸軍大將閉院宮載仁親王殿下之國葬，十八日晨於豐島岡葬塲嚴肅舉行，並蒙御差遣散使，皇后宮御史，皇太后宮御使參列葬禮，備極哀榮</p>
<h3>民衆訓練部推進工作</h3>

<h3>日讀賣新聞論渝共磨擦</h3>
<p>東京十八日中央社電　當地讀賣關聞以「激烈益甚之渝共武力衝突」為題，著論如下：重慶地區最近極堪注目之動向，為美式渝軍於雲南及華南方面之蠢動，與全國共產軍對渝軍之武力積極鬥爭。前者之裝備術與指揮等，皆為美式，是故與其謂為渝軍之自主行動，毋寗謂受美國之操縱而活動也。爰當美國發覺延安對重慶採取積極攻勢時，即應渝方之泣訴，而聲明否認延安政權，且中止援助武器，藉以明示單獨支持渝軍之態度。美國如此變更其對華政策，頗令延安及蘇聯大受剌激，因而　罵渝方之辭無微不至。蘇聯最近之論調，與對新　及外蒙古方面之謀略行為，即其明顯表現。至此，渝方以美國為背景，與延安以蘇聯為背之事實，業已暴露無道。是以吾人必須省察，無論渝延任何一方，雖處於東亞域內，然莫不具有藉外力支援之傾向也。</p>
<h3>B29型機昨空襲濱松　四日市附近落燒夷彈</h3>
<p>東京十八日中央社電　東海軍管區司令部十八日下午一時發表：馬里亞納基地B29型　約八十架，十八日零時四十五分左右，由志摩半島南岸附近侵入，逐次在伊勢灣口附近集合，其首批約五十架，經渥美半島東進，在濱松市附近以燒夷彈攻擊歷一小時，約在二時餘由東部建川及駿河灣附近向南方海上逸去。後批約三十架，由伊勢灣經知多半島中部而往西北，以燒夷彈攻擊四日市附近，一部經津及松坂方面，當時敵機始終以一架或極少架數，斷續行動於兩方面，致濱松市，四日市市內各處釀成火災，迄五時左右已行撲滅，此次空襲兩市之蒙害情形，刻在調查中。</p>
<p>九州四國先　被襲</p>
<p>東京十八日中央社電　西部軍管區司令部十八日上午十時發表：　馬里亞納基地之敵B29型機百架，由六月十七日下午十一時迄十八日四時二十分左右，以一部侵入關門地區及鹿兒島市附近，而以主力侵入大牟田市附近，在關門地區曾投下機雷，鹿兒島，大牟田市附近則發生火災，因日軍官民之努力撲救，迨十八日六時左右已經熄滅。　此次敵機來襲，重要設施之蒙害極輕微。</p>
<p>大阪十八日中央社電　十七日下午十時，由紀伊水道侵入之敵B29型機八架，於明石，鳴門海峽投下機雷後逸去，更於同時刻，另有敵機約七架，由四國西南端沿豐後水道北上，於周防灘，關門海峽投下機雷後遁去，此外，於十八日上午十一時，有PB四Y型機二架，侵入四國東南部，行動於阿波灘，和歌山縣沿岸等地，旋即遁去。又由志摩半島侵入之敵B29型機一架，盤旋於紀伊水道後遁去，途中於印南施行機槍掃射，又在箕島似曾投下機雷。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>歐美現勢與三頭會議</h3>
<p>歐戰結束以來，巳一月有餘，而國際形勢之發展，則不若一般觀察者之預測，不僅未呈急轉直下之勢，且迂迴曲折甚至險象環生。最近一個多月以來，舊金山的聯合國會議，波瀾橫生，演成中小國家和所謂强大國家間的樹立，而中小國家之敢於在會塲表現頑强態度，實際又有英國或美國為之支持，所以這種大小國家之間的對立，實際上又是大國即英美蘇法之間的對立。如果這種對立不設法加以解決，則所謂有聯合國世界和平與安全會議，決不會有什麼結果。</p>
<p>在舊金山會議期間，成為大國相互間衝突的最大事件，除了久成懸案的波蘭問題，阿根廷問題，和聯合國會議席上關於殖民地信託委任問題，安全理事會表決權問題，地域安全組織問題，發動軍事制裁「侵略國」問題以及新國聯組織憲章通過手續等等問題這，最近又先後發生英美南斯拉夫間的特里雅斯德港和格拉次市軍政問題，英美法義間的領土要求問題，英法間叙利亞黎巴嫩的武裝衝突問題，英美蘇法對德國佔領區的各種爭執，英美蘇間戰爭俘虜移交及待遇問題，乃至最近又有英法間關於西北非洲丹吉爾地方之爭，所有這一切問題，包含着帝國主義和社會主義間的戰後勢力範圍之爭，包含着帝國主義國家相互間的權利之爭，也包含着帝國主義霸權和殖民地弱小民族解放之爭。內容都非常複雜。但基本因素只在英美法三國間的相互猜欵和仇恨。</p>
<p>最近，英美蘇聯間之猜疑最明顯的，是英美政界反蘇活動的抬頭。特別是英國政界，他們想恢復第一次世界大戰後，以英國為中心的新歐洲均勢制度，但已引起反對黨向邱吉爾政權民開攻勢，結果乃有最近英國的政變，聯合內閣解體，國會亦於本月十五日解散，政潮正隨選舉戰而澎湃着。美國方面，反蘇派和羅斯福派的政爭也已展開，使特魯曼總統深感不安，而不得不局部改組政府。</p>
<p>然而國際局勢之嚴重性有加無巳。於是特魯曼，邱吉爾，史太林三頭會議的呼聲日高一日，企圖由三頭會議來把以上一切國際糾紛作一次總算總解決。為着英美蘇對於三頭會議在原則上都巳贊同，特魯曼曾痛下决心，派遣羅斯福生平最得用的親信，美國進步派政治家的領袖，台維斯和霍浦金，分赴倫敦及莫斯科游說。由於這兩個特魯曼私人代表的活躍，使邱吉爾和史太林在國際政策方面，逐漸表示接近，結果最近以波蘭問題開始，如德國佔領區統治問題，舊金山會議中的爭執問題，都已漸呈轉機，替三頭會議開出一條路來。不過三國間根本的矛盾未見解除，不斷的會議，是否有濟於事，始終是一個欵問。</p>
<h3>陳彬龢氏返滬談懇談糧食呾經過</h3>
<p>本市市政諮詢委員陳彬穌氏，此次應國府陳代主席之召，赴京參與糧食問題之懇談，聞於昨日返滬，記者特趨陳氏，承發表談話如次：</p>
<p>當局關注糧食問題</p>
<p>問：此次赴京，是否專為商討糧食問題？答：本人巳有十五年未到南京，十四日應陳代主席之召，一面感於糧食問題之嚴重性有增無已，極願貢獻一得之見，以作當局參考。周時應召赴京者，尚有蘇省任省長，前駐日蔡大使。據本人觀察，最近兩星期來，國民政府各有關當局，莫不將全部精神，集中注意於糧食問題，而盟邦　政當局，亦極關心。因此，在中日當局共同決心之下，毅然採取對於米糧之緊急措置，吾人站在人民立塲，表示欽佩與感謝。在決定緊急措置辦法發表之日，適逢天雨，農田正以久旱切望甘霖，誠可謂「自助天助」。</p>
<p>統制技術務求合理</p>
<p>問：米糧緊急措置辦法旣經公佈，今後對於米糧統制是否取銷？</p>
<p>答：此次對於米糧之措置，係屬臨時緊急辦法。在此戰時，實施統制經濟政策，在原則上勢所必行，尤其在中國，政治力量薄弱，一部份商人道德墮落，更須合理之經濟統制。本人在京除參加懇談外，復曾與中樞各當局及盟邦陸海軍大使館各當局暨幹部人員個別交換意見兩次，各方面對食糧問題均極關心，一致認為今後在統制之技術方面，務必適合中國國情民情，務求合理而減少人民不必要之痛苦。至於具體辦法，尙在作最後考慮，未至發表時期。目前在緊急措置辦法之後，第二步主要工作即為抑平米價，從疏暢米源，取締囤積，防止居奇，雜糧調節等辦法入手，由中日當局及民間三方面力量，聯合進行。</p>
<p>京市絕無投機現象</p>
<p>問：最近南京米價如何？</p>
<p>答：本人於當時米價每石四十八萬元，十七日夜車離京時，每石二十四萬元，來源暢通後，必將再低。南京周市長對於疏通米糧來源一事，備極努力，一般民生亦較安定，市面頗為平靜。如上海市塲之金價股票等等，投機活動，在南京則無此現象。</p>
<p>放出雜糧調節民食</p>
<p>問：據報載盟邦派遣軍當局允以前次收買之小麥雜糧，在上海盡量放出，配給民需，未知何時實現？</p>
<p>答：十七日下午，本人臨行時，事為此事，訪問盟邦總軍部當局，承表示負責辦理，不久即可源源接濟，本人當即代表滬市市民致謝。目前在需軍迫切之時，盟軍當局為重視民食，不但停止軍需收買，且將已收買之雜糧放出調節，尤堪感佩，希望本市市民對於糧食，不必過份恐慌，米價或可再回。上海雜糧價格隨米暴漲一事，南京中日當局亦認為極不合理，主張嚴厲取締，此次本市雜糧業公會自動通吿會員商平價發售雜糧，用意可佩。惟尙有少數雜糧商及業外人之囤積居奇者，希望市民檢舉，俾請當局取締。</p>
<h3>日軍精銳部隊在豫新作戰　佔領官莊岔道口等地</h3>
<p>河南前綫十八日中央社電　河南方面日軍精銳部隊，五月十三日拂曉對渝第一戰區軍開始猛攻，十八日攻陷偏口·五厚·新店·五厚窑後，十九日攻陷靈寶·廬氏間要衝官莊，岔道口，使無暇整理陣勢，一鼓作氣，沿廬氏街道南下，二十三日佔領官道口北方之石太山·馬家山·百家村西方高地，佔取官道口附近之戰略要衝，渝第四十軍，第三十八軍，於官道口之連絡要衝，因受日軍猛攻，狼狽不堪，第九十軍亦由廬氏急於北上，同時於該地附近集結約五師兵力，準備反攻，日軍於廬氏街道陣地迎戰，更對來襲駱駝坡之第四十軍第二百〇六師一部，予以重創，將其擊潰，至此高呼總反攻之渝第一戰區軍，其中樞已完全陷入混亂狀態，自開始作戰以來至五月底止，已查明之綜合戰果如次：掩埋屍體一〇七四具，俘虜六十二名，鹵獲品甚多</p>
<p>河南前綫十八日中央社電　渝方自稱百攻不克之岔道口，全山皆為近代要塞，然經日軍一度猛攻，業被攻破。該方面地形，築成環狀交通壕與散兵壕，其新編第四十軍，即據守該區，而由槍眼陣地向外射擊，日軍由十七日夜至十八日晨，突行夜襲及拂曉攻擊，敢於寗設五米至十米之掩蔽壕之山釐，强行突破數處，全員肉博進攻，一齊突入敵陣，十九日下午九時，終於城頭高樹日章旗。</p>
<p>河南前綫十八日中央社電　日軍壓制下之廬氏街道，乃靈寶·廬氏·西安等黃河沿岸各地之主要孔道，渝第一戰區最重要之路綫，該地之渝軍深恐喪失，陸續糾集河南東方正面及後方第二基地預備軍，僅此次之作戰地域，渝方已出動兵力三軍九師之衆，用阻日軍南下，復調第四十軍戰時幹部訓練國學生約三百名於岔道口，此外，並令第五十三師集結於樹溝洞方面，第九十軍亦正陸續開向前綫，以期挽回頹勢。</p>
<h3>桂省西北渝軍動靜</h3>
<p>廣州十八日中央社電　桂省西北部方面渝軍，於旬日來有激化之預兆，八日，陸軍總司令何應欽與駐渝美軍戰鬥司令新克爾阿，曾赴該地視察。同時，交通部長愈飛鵬，亦飛赴該方視察沿路狀况，於十一日返渝。據十四日重慶廣播，西南公路管理局長陳亭烱，為視察桂省前綫軍火運輸及各公路之建設狀况，於十三日下午赴桂省河池西北方之南丹。又副局長邱秉敏，被派至百色視察，一方面，駐屯湖南省芷江之戰時運辦理局公路第二總隊，急調至桂省西北部，第一總隊亦奉命隸屬於西南公路，刻正由昆明向貴陽移動中，足證渝軍對該方面已增强兵力，並對桂柳地區準備反攻。</p>
<h3>日寄遞郵件嚴格限制</h3>
<p>東京十八日中央社電　日本寄往朝鮮，關東州及滿國之郵件，明信片及公用者外，悉皆停止辦理。此次定十九日起，寄遞中國之郵件，除信件以外，一般郵件亦停止辦理，十七日業由日遞信院正式發表。</p>
<h3>舊金山會通過五田妥協案　否决權問題解決</h3>
<p>東京十八日中央社電　舊金山會議最後重要問題之否決權問題，業經英美法渝等五大國之妥協而吿解決，雖然澳洲等中小國極力反對，但因十二日之表決該否決權，業依照五大國之妥協案而被採納。按否決權問題，於國際憲章中並未使用否決權之字句，依雅爾達之表決方式，凡安全保　理事會某事項之決定，必須常任理事國全體同意，然其中並未言明必須全員一致之範圍。現實問題言之，如果五次大國中之一國反對安全理事國之決定時，則理事會之決定即不能成立，乃為充分發揮新國際機構之機能。同盟各國尤以五大國，更須一致協力，假如其中之一國加以否決，而其他各國絕不能容認時，國際機構即失去其存在之意義。是以蘇聯要求常任理事國須有否決權之主張，可謂正確，旦復明示國際機構惟有依賴國際信義也，故中小國之反對此案，亦屬當然，蓋中小國如無申言反對，即承認國際憲章不啻根本忍受大國之絕對支配權也。故澳洲代表羅馬特外長提出之未決定行使武力時，不得發動否決權之修正案，曾獲得紐西蘭等中小各國之熱烈支持，然結果終吿失敗。無論戰後出現何種國際機構，不過為一處理戰後各問題及國際事業之各政府連絡機構而已，除為壓迫其範圍內之弱小國之機關外，大國如任所欲為，則定與舊國際聯盟相同，如海市蜃樓，瞬間即逝矣。</p>
<p>大會功能問題各國見解紛岐</p>
<p>里斯本十八日中央社電　據舊金山電：舊金山會議執行委員會於十七日上午舉行會方我，商討處理蘇聯反對未來案全組織大會有廣泛之討論權力一項問題。美參議員威登保十六日下午在處理大會政治與安全功能之委員會中，代表四邀請國發表演說，主張大會之功能，應限於建議而非討論。英國烏克蘭及蘇聯之代表均發言，支持威登保之見解。然委員會之會議仍陷於　持下，次會期尙未決定。十六日上午之五大國會議，蘇代表格羅米柯已表示渠將於上述委員會會議中，重提此一問題，其後四大國仍訂定威登保所提出之妥協案、然小國均反對此一問題，將由下次召開之執行委員討論。</p>
<h3>侵領軍需物次渝槍決罪犯</h3>
<p>廣州十八日中央社電　據重慶廣播稱：渝方於十四日奉蔣介石命，將在昆明後方勤務司令部服務之前調查司長梁林及少將一人，上校一人，以侵領軍需物資罪，處以槍決</p>
<h3>倫敦波政府代表抵蘇京</h3>
<p>瑞典京城十八日中央社電　據倫敦駐莫斯科訪員稱：對聯合國團結一致時予以重大障礙之波蘭問題，最近將有解決之可能。蓋目前之莫斯科會談，實針對波蘭新政府組織問題，採取決定性之步驟，而覓取解決之途。據稱，倫敦波流亡政府首相米柯拉席克及社會黨領袖斯登電克等，均於週六抵莫斯科，其他波蘭要負多人亦均在莫斯科靜修會議之開幕。</p>
<h3>敎部報吿最近施政概况　切實推行戰時社會敎育</h3>
<p>南京十八日中央社電　敎部於十八日會見中外記者團，由普通敎育司任司長代表李部長，報吿最近施政情形如次：　「通行各省市訂定小敎進修及獎勵辦法」本部業經分咨各省市審酌定小學敎育進修及獎勵辦法，報部備核。　「通令各校不得提前放假」各級學校學期起迄，及上課日數，應遵照本部修正學校學車，學期及休假日期規程辦理，不得籍故提前放假，紊亂學制。　「分發國師畢業生服務」本年國師畢業學生五十餘人，依照各生志願，分別發上海、南京、江蘇、安徽及華北等地前往服務　「督促國立兩職校，注重實習及就職指導」職業學校為生產人材訓練之塲所，當特別注意重學重之實習，以期增進學術之技能。　「籌增中大學附屬實騐中學班」中大附屬實騐中學，負實騐敎育上新方法及提供實習之使命，內容辦理自須充實，下學年起，該校擬將初高中班次予擴增，以應需要。　「推進戰時社會敎育」本部曾制定戰時社會敎育實施綱要，茲為切實推進，以收宏效起見，分咨各省市轉飭各級社敎機關，積極進行，並嚴予督促進推考核。　「滙款救助留日被災學生」因於所在地時受空襲災害，頗有生活艱窘者，本部特撥準備金，各予救助以資救濟。</p>
<h3>戰犯執委會英委員赴蘇</h3>
<p>瑞典京城十八日中央社電　據倫敦報吿稱：副檢察長華爾達及其他各英國戰時犯罪執行委員會委員，於今日由空路離英赴莫斯科。</p>
<h3>印大會黨執委全體恢復自由　西姆拉會議下週一舉行</h3>
<p>里斯本十八日中央社電　據倫敦來電：英印度事務大臣阿梅立十五日會見記者時宣稱，英國政府十四日夜釋放印度國民會議派之執行委員八名，其中七名為印度敎徒，一名為回敎徒，乃現任會議派議長之阿柴特。又十五名執行委員中，七名業被釋放，至此會議派之全體執行委員，業已恢復自由矣。</p>
<p>里斯本十八日中央社電　印度總督華維爾，因英政府提出新提案，特發表於二十五日在西姆拉舉行印度各派領袖會議。茲據新德里電，回敎徒聯盟總裁琴那，為圖於事前先作聯絡起見，要求會議延期二星期舉行，然華維爾對此嚴予拒絕，表示會議必須於二十五日舉行，凡於會議前作詳細討論，則非所企望。</p>
<p>里斯本十八日中央社電　據孟買消息：印度議院主席阿柴特，聞已被邀參加於二十五日在西姆拉召開之印度各領袖會議</p>
<p>尼赫魯談話痛斥英政策</p>
<p>里斯本十八日中央社電　據孟買電稱：十四日晚被釋之尼赫魯氏，於十六日發表談話，痛斥英國之羊頭狗肉政策如次：印度不被解放，則世界絕無適當之新秩序，禽議派基本之目標，仍在於「印度之獨立自由」。在一貫强者支配弱者之世界中，印度之獨立不可期，然而四億民族於未獲自由之前，世界當永無安定秩序之出現云。</p>
<p>印度除著名之會議派及回敎徒聯盟外，尙有一負盛名於遐邇之有力黨派「全印黨」，該黨之代表亦未被邀請參加西姆拉會議，難怪該領袖提出抗議，而適在西姆拉會議迫近之今日，則可知印度政界之風雲依然險惡。</p>
<h3>哈哈博士被控通敵罪在倫敦受審</h3>
<p>瑞典京城十八日中央社電　據英京消息：被控為德人廣播演詞之威廉·喬埃斯（一名勞特·哈哈博士），於今日被解至倫敦波爾街刑庭，以通敵大罪傳審之。當首席審判官勃立奇向渠訊問對被控為通敵大罪有何反辯之處，渠答稱「無」。又當渠之罪狀宣讀之時，審判官問渠有無辯論，渠答稱，「余已聽得此罪狀之宣讀，幷將靜候裁判，余亦不欲將在軍部內所提出之供詞有所增滅」。又當審判官問渠有無問題時，渠復答稱「無」。喬埃斯對渠將被押至下週一再傳審一項，亦不表示反抗，故渠備於被吿席上站立數分鐘而已。</p>
<h3>比利時政局嚴重</h3>
<p>瑞典京城十八日中央社電　據白魯塞爾訊：比利時首相阿干，因鑒於里奧波國王近將返國，已實行總辭職，然渠復於昨日宣稱，「余並非離開政府，同時希望能繼續首相之職位」。阿氏此項談話，乃明示在目前暫時放棄其權限，猶希望里奧波國王能退位而不干涉政治。現整個比利時之局勢，已趨嚴重性。</p>

<h3>洞庭西山概觀</h3>
<p>— 藍彧</p>
<p>民風一斑</p>
<p>西山是滬市人口疏散地之一，看着孤峙太湖的西山，四面臨湖，確是頗合理想的戰時桃源。</p>
<p>西山類似　形，周圍約九十餘里，計八鄕二鎭——東河鎭，消夏鎭；匯里，鎭夏，七賢，鹿村，前灣，東園，涵植，梨棠。比較東湖鎭最熱鬧，亦為間業及交通中心。</p>
<p>全山現有人口約三萬四千餘人，農民佔百分之七十，商人佔百分之十，其他如漁牧礦工等，佔百分之二十。由於地處偏僻，近代的文明思潮，未能普及，封建色彩極濃。同時，歷來未受兵燹，出產亦豐，人民足能自耕自給，故成一種傳統的閑散習慣，工作之外，不問世事，閑空的時間，多半消磨在茶肆。但民風敦厚，性質誠篤，稍受波折，輒歸咎於命運，行者讓道，好謙息爭，絕少都市習氣。</p>
<p>風景名勝</p>
<p>名勝古蹟頗多，歷史上亦不乏知名之士，如明嘉靖吏部尙書徐縉，為該地之大族，至今其後裔繁盛，幾佔東河鎭平數。風光旖旎，山巒起伏，飄渺峯最高，天氣陰沉，或風雨之夕，即有浮雲縈迥山巔，極烟霧遠峯之致。飄渺峯山脚下，有玄帝廟，春秋之際，香火很盛。</p>
<p>風景最佳者，推石公山，地臨湖濱，上有古剎，樹本葱鬰，但現時有湖匪出沒，遊者絕足。鎭夏鄕有「天下第九洞」，其沿甚深，黝黑無比，相傳可通杭州靈隱，離奇之神話殊多，但至今未有盡其底者，雖恃好奇者間或有人，引火深入，然均阻於洞內漳氣，半途即返。洞前有岳廟，洞背有草庵寺，在此處看東山，僅一水之隔而已。</p>
<p>鎭夏包山，尙有大雲寺，在東河鎭南除附近，亦即「碧螺春」名茶之所產地。此處寺僧，咸以自製香茗奉客。近傍有古碧螺庵，相傳碧螺春之茶葉所以著名，據云乾隆下江南，曾遊歷於此，尼無以奉客，乃亟採山茶，貼於胸口，乾後製茗供乾隆皇帝，帝飲後，通稱好茶，有乳香，因以得名。語難近幼稚，然亦頗饒風趣。此外，尙有天阜寺，明萬曆時曾重修，現已塌毀。七賢鄕福源寺，內藏古物甚多，如　鐘，石檻，石拂等。</p>
<p>農產收穫</p>
<p>西山出產，除稻麥等農作物以外，當推蠶絲及菓物，此外水產尙亦豐富。農業方面，因平地不多，故米糧產量甚少，僅供全山人口二月之需。耕作及工具，無多改良，一仍襲用舊法。蠶絲之境况，已遠不如前，據該山農民謂，事變之前，一擔　　，可抵二擔半曰主，而現在，僅　時之零數。農民以無利可圖，都砍桑為柴。至菓物為西山之特產，四季不斷，如最近上市之「白少枇杷」。銀杏楊梅，均為該山名產，枇杷在蘇滬等地端節前後，觸目皆是，但在該山現無多見。蓋年來農村凋敝，生計窘困，些微出產，即爭光求售，並換取生活用品及充農事資本之用。</p>
<p>枇杷行情</p>
<p>嘗詢諸當地農民以今年枇杷行市咸搖頭不置，蓋將枇杷把裝運赴蘇，沿途須經關卡二十左右，所耗多寡不定，故當地之賣價如每斤為三百元，到蘇即須達七百元之譜。而彼等裝運至蘇州行家時，行家知農民之境况，利用其弱點，故賤其値。農民雖欲待價而沽，無如限於吃用盤纏，及儲藏等種種關係，又以正在農忙時期，只得忍通出售。所以今年枇杷價格雖高，種者不蝕本已是不幸。</p>
<p>楊梅新價的二萬五千元，今年雨水不多，產量不豐，亦無曩年之甜美及圓大。查子將過市，該冊所產，特別香甜，亦特別大。桃子尙少應市。此外毛栗，石榴，橘子及櫻桃，產量頗豐，以上菓樹，遍植各山，每當春三四月開花之時，睥目四野，紅綠相間，芬芳　麗，身臨其境，頗有世外桃源之感。</p>
<p>煤礦實况</p>
<p>礦產蘊　體富，現有煤礦公司實成實山兩家，每家職工，不上二千餘人，工人分男工，女工，童工，每日三班，每班工作八小時，其開採用土法，實成計有四井，實山井，井深達十餘丈，各洞有隧道可通，井口有車盤，盤上繞長東，礦工下井時，由女工數人，轉動車盤，繩束之一端繫一吊籃，徐徐轉動，徐徐下沉，每井設二車盤，輪流升降，採得之煤，亦用此輪轉之吊籃起出。礦工在礦開煤時，先在礦底打洞，然後實以炸藥，引上火繩，使之爆炸，故所採之煤塊不大。在礦底所採之煤，由童工檢於車內，沿隧道推至就近井底，再將煤塊移放於吊籃，由井上女工起出。兩礦產煤，每日計達百餘噸，所產之煤，多半供給華中水電公司。兩礦工人待遇，以物價計算，最近每工一日約可得五千元左右，女童工以七五折作比例，平時尙有廉價發售，其待遇超過職員之上。</p>
<p>其他鑛產，如白泥（可製火磚磁器），礬石（可供搪瓷原料），黃沙，石料（可製水泥及石灰），梨棠並曾發現錳礦，聞蘊藏量相當豐富，一旦開發，產量定必可觀。</p>
<p>敎育治安</p>
<p>西山之敎育，極為低落，一般農民，咸以為躬耕可以自給，故對於子女敎育，不甚注意。現有完全區立小學二所，鄕立小學八所，另有私塾一二所，設備均甚簡陋，全區入學兒童，約計一千餘名。治安有警察及警備隊。衛生方面極差，以往尙有醫療設備，嗣因經費無着，一為外科金仲康，一為內科決華寺　　和尙。至於交通工具，鎭市僅黃包車，數量亦少，鄕間仍襲用竹轎，板車。無公路，街道最闊者約五尺左右。公產以寺廟最多，次為祠堂。當地房屋，高大寬敞，極其堅固，且有建自明淸者。</p>
<p>區政推進</p>
<p>自新區長金白荻接任後，鑒於西山亟須開發，並為滬市人口疏散地之一，感覺責任重大，乃對政務之推進，不遣餘力，其工作，本身方面：　聯絡有關當局，疏通米糧來源。　勸導農民，加緊增產，利用荒廢山地，播種雜糧。　訓練靑年農民，加强自衛力量，維持地方治安。　舉辦農民識字學校，灌輸農民實用知識。對於疏散方面，協助當地所論之滬市疏散委會分辦事處，調查公產及房屋數量，以供滬慈善團體，學校，及人口移住之用。</p>
<p>疏散工作</p>
<p>滬市人口疏散至西山，就記者觀察，頗為適當。滬上人士曾屢往該地視察，該山不獨可容相當數字人口，並且實藏亦豐，移滬市資金至該地開發建設，至為適當，在此籌備疏散之時，不可不加注意者：即治安，交通，糧食，日用品及傢具之籌集四者。</p>
<p>當地治安力量薄弱，雖已在加强壯丁訓練，但短期內難收效果，且亦缺少槍械，太湖夙為匪徒淵藪，尤以戰時以來，槍械流落甚多，挺而走險者不乏其人，有為生計逼迫者，有退伍軍警及不良份子，太湖廣大，易於逃竄，出沒無常，難於為力，此輩湖匪，若不加以肅淸，疏散工作，不無影響。</p>
<p>其次交通，太湖及西山內河，有數處湖水甚淺，宜用平底船。復次米糧，該山產量，原供該山人口二月之需，其他均仰給外來。滬市人口如疏散至該處，事前須至各地大量採購，至少應有三四月之存量，除米糧以外，油，鹽，菜蔬等，亦須有相當儲藏。再次，日用品及傢具等，應作相當之準備，預為搬運。</p>
<p>以上四點，倘能予以解決，則疏散工作，自可順利行矣。（完）</p>

<h3>各銀行供糧商資金　用途必須正當　檢查金融處嚴格檢查防止囤積</h3>
<p>近來各地米價，逐日狂漲，漫無止境，上海方面尤甚，政府已斷然實施食糧緊急對策，中央儲備銀行總廠兼滬市長周佛海氏，昨爲此車發表談話如次：</p>
<p>周兼總裁發表談話</p>
<p>「國府鑒於最近米價奇昂情况，決完採取緊急措置對策，暫時停止米統會收買工作，撤廢移動限制，並承盟邦方面全面協力，中止軍米收買。此項緊急措置實施後，米糧來源自能充分圓滑，價格當可逐步低落，民貪得以維持。但是移動限制撤廢後，難保不肖商人從事收買囤積　斷，則於米糧恐慌。仍難解除。爲嚴防此項流弊計，本人已飭中央儲備銀行檢査金融車務處，檢查各銀行供給糧商之資金，是否用於正當購運之途，並令經濟警察，隨時密查有無囤積壟斷之糧商，一經查實，定予按律嚴懲，決不寬貸。」</p>
<h3>雜糧平價普售　警局嚴格執行　經濟警察隊派員調查</h3>
<p>本市警察局第四處經濟保安科，暨經濟警察總隊，對經濟保安事宜，積極推進，尤其對物價嚴格管理，依照經濟局曁物價評議委員會等經濟行政機構規定之方案，及許定之物價嚴格執行，對違反經濟條例，或超越限價等各種不法商人，均予取締查辦。關於雜糧一項，雜糧業同業公會爲　及民生而擬定赤豆等價格，旦已呈准經濟局核准公佈施行，已於十七日起由請公會會飭各會員行號，一律遵照普售，唯暫定每人限購五市斤，經濟保安科暨經濟警察隊，已派員至全市各區調查雜糧行號，如有超越上項平價或持貨担絕出售情事，當予查辦，民衆亦可公開檢舉。</p>
<p>雜糧規定標準定價</p>
<p>上海區雜糧業同業公會，以奉市經濟局令爲救濟民食需要，對於雜糧買賣規定標準定價，以每十五日爲一期，不得擅行抬高，俾使米　抑平，而杜舉漲。該會爰於昨日通知所屬會員行號切實遵辦，所有零售商絕對不得拒售或增高價格，以維民食而重公令，該業昨已一體實行。</p>
<p>黑市米價日趨下跌</p>
<p>又政府爲關　民生，並得盟邦諒解，採取抑平米價疏通來源之緊急措置，停止收買軍米，米統會亦停止收買工作，且盟邦駐軍當局將收買之小麥雜糧等在上海出售，故本市民心已定，即經濟警察常局，亦已遭奉政府明令，對米糧之搬邇已不加限制取締，仍出商民自由樣運，四郊經濟監視哨，已停止是項米　搬運限制取締工作，故食米黑市價格，日趨下跌，尤因雜糧價格之合理評價普售，而食米更可望日趨下跌，市民無庸　慮。</p>
<h3>改善市區交通　籌創公共馬車　徐建設局長談話</h3>
<p>滬市市區廣闊，人口衆多，而公共交通工具，日見缺乏，如電車限制行駛時問’法商公共汽車（即紅色汽車）全部停駛，市民出行，　感不便，中央社記者特爲此事，走訪市建設局局長你季敦氏，承告如下：</p>
<p>創辦公共馬車</p>
<p>電車減少，及法商汽車停駛，全因電力及燃料關係，爲戰時不可或免之現象。本局對於最近市區公共交通困難情形，極爲關切，現正鼓勵車商，仿照南京市成例，創辦公共馬車，分站行駛，務使價廉便利，裨益市民。茲據上海公共馬軍行籌備處，擬訂創辦計劃，及預定行駛路綫鬭，曁票價表等項，呈送到局，已轉呈市府核辦，俟奉令核准，即可辦理。</p>
<p>管理三輪車業</p>
<p>三輪車爲事變後新興之交通事業，亦爲現時最重要之交通工具，以前規定營業三輪車，須先有行基，方可領照，以致個人所置之三輸車戰牌營業，流弊甚多。現在本局爲取締戰牌　斷起見，已訂定管理營業三輪車暫行規則，呈奉市府核准公布施行，嗣後不論公司或個人所置之營集三輪車，均可照章申謂牌照。又三輸車夫對於規定車資以外，額外需索，木局照章從嚴取締，希望市民多予協力，隨時檢舉</p>
<p>重視人力車業市區營業人力車，數量甚多，過去勞資雙方，常因車租等問題，發生糾紛。惟際茲戰時非常時期，資方應體卹勞方之困苦，勞方亦應顧全資方之血本，和衷共濟，彼此合作，方可避免糾紛。本局對此項問題，頗爲重視，並與各有關方而，隨時　緊，切實改進。</p>
<h3>戶口粉額外配給　積極籌備中</h3>
<p>遲來本市來價狂　不已，一般平民無力購買白米，大都改食雜糧。關於戶口粉配給，雖能按期配給，但仍屬杯水車薪。上海區粉麩統配處對於市民因食糧而加重負担之痛苦，極表關心。現擬舉辦戶口粉額外配給，稍解民食之恐慌，現正在積極準備中，除經商請粉麥會撥出一部份麵粉，一俟與有關配給機關連絡就緖，而無其他阻碍，則日內常可實現。</p>
<h3>三省市配糖　照常進行</h3>
<p>中日糖業協會自　管食糖統配工作，關於本市食糖已配發四期，茲悉所有蘇浙皖三省市縣之配給糖，經與有關常局協議，決仍照常核配，至以交通問題，未能運達之地區，亦在積極設法輸送中。</p>
<h3>警局錄用職員　規定辦法</h3>
<p>本市警察局周兼局長，因査各分局，隊·所·院，請委職員或扒補長警時，竟有不問索質優劣，逕行呈報，殊屬忽視幣察之眞諦，雖不能苛求極度優良，但亦應求其相常，否則濫竽充數，何堪設想。茲規定投効長　，須由原送同所隊先行老核，若果學術優良身體健全者，再行呈送總局應試，以重公務。又查應試員警，每經一再通知，方來考騐，即來應試，大都仍未揚　照片，往返　　，　延時日，嗣後各分局隊所院，呈請委派職員或抵補長　時，須飭本人携同照片隨文到局應試，以資　捷而免稽　。</p>
<p>兩主任督察長對調</p>
<p>又訊，該局督察處第三督察區主任督察長滿錫九，與第四督察區主任得察長徐　　對調，該兩主任拼察長已於前日分別則區辦公。</p>
<h3>華鐵職員舞弊　盼予檢舉</h3>
<p>華中鐵道公司當局，最近對車站秩序之維持及旅客購票手續之改善，頗爲顯著，而一般公司職員不正當行爲，及無禮舉動之取締，尤爲嚴厲。據該公司上海管理局監察室負責人表示。　鐵職員倘有舞弊情事，如社會人士能與公司合作，盡量檢舉，或提供有關資料，則在制裁及拼察方面，庶可獲事半功倍之效。</p>
<p>國民論壇</p>
<h3>改良大衆讀物的　連環調查</h3>
<p>— 司馬雄</p>
<p>我相信，街頭的連環圖畫，該是擁有最多續者的出版物。連環圖書的讀者，範圍眞廣，自中學生，小學生，學從，小職員，女工，拉軍子的，以至於流浪街頭的拾荒孩子，都　連環圖畫的忠實的讀者，其中最多的是孩子，迎環圖畫所給予他們的影營比學校裏的課本要高出幾萬倍。</p>
<p>然而，連環圖畫給予孩子們是什麼呢？不久以前，徐家滙曾發生過幾個孩子離家到峨眉山訪道的事，推動他們的力量，我想大半該是連環圖畫。</p>
<p>不可否認的，連環岡畫是普遍的大衆讀物，尤其那個一面是圖，一面是簡潔的文字的形式，在我們這文盲遍地的國度裏，確然能增加閱讀的興趣，帮助文字的理解，如果好好地利用，功效是不在民衆教育之下的。</p>
<p>要改良運環圖畫，使成爲眞正的良好的大衆　物，最主要的是改變內容。有人以爲改變內容就會失去讀者，這是錯誤的。如果改得好，不但能抓作原有的讀者，並且能增加讃者，從而達到民衆教育的目的的。首先，我提出下面幾點：</p>
<p>一，當局站在肅正意識的立塲上，嚴厲取締內容荒謬怪　足以妨礙身心戰展的連環圖畫，禁止出版傳閱，而保留其內容純正者。</p>
<p>二，由各文化聯關如書局，報館，雜誌社。出版公司等機關，用新的形式和新的內容，出版新的連環圖畫，同樣地銷給街　小書　，以求普及。</p>
<p>三，迎環圖畫的出版者儘最改革內容，廢除那　神仙飛劍妖怪之類，用新的人物去做故事的主角</p>
<p>在內容方面，代善那些怪異的故事的，應該確是大衆所需要讀的，固然，改良連環圖畫的目的不只是迎合大衆的需要，也還得要想到提高大衆的永准，我們不能讓那一大羣的讀者老是停留在黃天剛，白玉堂的時代裏，深得跟着時代向前走。爲此，我以爲新的連環圖拼的內容，應該包括下面幾種：</p>
<p>時事的演述：如第二次歐戰起末，舊金山會議等。</p>
<p>社會的進化：小而言之，如上海租界的從開鬧到收回……</p>
<p>生活的故事：現實生活下的無數的悲劇……</p>
<p>歷史故事：一些最動人的故事……</p>
<p>世界知識：如北極探險，無綫電的發明，非洲士人……</p>
<p>一時也想不出多少，不過我德以爲該給大衆的知識正各着，不該只是飛劇之類的東西，至於學生，如果能將敎科書加以述　圖書化，或者就以連環　盡（自然是改良的）來代參教科書，我擔保學習的情緒和興趣一定會增加幾千倍。</p>
<p>改良連環圖畫似乎早就有人提過了，然而到現在，充斥在街頭書攤上的，還是那一批貨色，在不知不覺中將毒素播送給最大數的讀者，（而那些讀者們平常只有這唯一讀物的）我希望這回不只是空話，因爲如果連這點也辦不到，那麼一切的教育，尤其是民衆教育，都是白費的。</p>
<h3>第四起金證券　明日起發行　掛牌價格今日商議决定</h3>
<p>中央儲備銀行發行之金證券，第四期定於明（二十）日起發行，出售日期仍爲三天，至二十二日截止，此期金證券掛牌價格，今（十九）日召集會議即可斟酌市情討論決定。關於金證券市塲，現正在裝修中，一俟設備完齊，即可開市。</p>
<p>中儲營業時間照舊</p>
<p>本市各銀行盛莊爲節省人力物力，經銀錢業聯席會議決定，縮短營業時問兩小時，於昨（十八）日起將原定營業時間上午九時至十二時，下午一時至三時，改爲上午九時至下午一時止。茲悉中央儲備銀行鑒於業務繁忙，並爲便利市民起見，共營業時間仍維特原有狀况，爲上午九時至十二時，下午一時至三時，幷不改　。</p>
<h3>學校用水　寬放限量</h3>
<p>本市自來水自實行戰時限止以來，各校川水均超過限量，每月對款驚人，經市教育會與有關當局數度交涉，請求寬放限量，免繳罸款後，業　華中水電公司斟酌各校實際情形，准予寛放，並顧及教育界之淸苔，允緩繳罰款。聞一部份學校已接到該公司通知，其未及由請各校，仍可繼續向市教育會申請。</p>
<h3>僞報營業稅額華龍公司受閥</h3>
<p>本市財政局，爲杜絕漏稅起見，對於各業所報春季營業稅額，是否屬實，經分飭各區稽微處派員調查。茲悉泰山路區　微處組員錘祥生，調查員徐寗生，査得泰山路四八六號華龍公司寄售部帳册有眞僞兩種，方在資爲間，詎料該店負責人趙逸明，竟開具十萬元支票兩紙，意圖行賄。該二員認爲有意侮辱公務人員，即將眞僞帳册運同支票一併呈繳，由稽徵處傳問屬實，並查明該公司應繳春季營業稅爲二十五萬八千二百三十八元，除已據繳二千三百二十四元外，須補繳二十　萬五干九百十四元，處　部份請示後，經局方核定僞造帳目，照應納稅款八倍處罰，計罰金二百零四萬七千三百十二元，行賄部份姑念商民無知，從寛免究，支票發還，鍾徐二員不爲利誘，各給獎金五萬元。</p>
<h3>海員特別黨部舉行代表大會</h3>
<p>中國國民黨特別黨部，十六日下午舉行代表大會，出席各區黨部代表六十餘名，暨有關各機關代表等，由主席李凱臣報告開會宗旨，中央黨部組維部副部長座蘭溪代表呂天放處長監選致訓。當選名單如下：執行委員李凱臣。陳元龍·員變禧。宋筱雲·李烈武，候補執行委員周榮錦·殷勗哉，監察委員謝　城。周虎丞（候補）。</p>
<h3>體育　夏令足球邀請賽　下月初展幕　五路雄師參加逐鹿</h3>
<p>上海足球聯合會，鑒於足球季飾雖已結東，爲不使甲組球員技術生疎，故特發起舉辦夏令足球邀請賽，籌備業已就緖，預定下月之第一週開始比賽。參加者計聯誼·葡商·僑聯·滬警及華倫等五路雄師，東華因球員負傷及離滬關係，不克參加，故亦未曾邀請。五隊中聯誼·葡商·僑聯三隊，仍以參加聯賽之原班人馬參加，滬警勞勃斯托夫及麥其當退出，遞補者有法陸軍諸名將。華倫除劉祖儒郎少山班底外，並拉攏德商全部將士，實力非同小可，沉寂之足球壇，又將有一番熱鬧氣象。</p>

<h3>長寗路萃廉里斷水　籲請寬放限度</h3>
<p>滬西長寗路二百四十弄瘁康里，人口衆多，水量不敷應用，以致超越限度。最近弄內遂吿全部斷水，迄今巳有多日，各戶淘米洗菜，均向土井汲水，然井水混濁，而又發臭，益以天氣漸熱，易生疾病。如無妥善辦法，禍患不堪設想。籲請當局，實際調在，顧念民困，寬放用水限量，以維衛生，不勝切盼。（本里住戶）</p>

<h3>記挽瀾中學音樂會</h3>
<p>挽瀾中學這次用一個盛大的中西音樂會來紀念校慶，來絕念一年來在艱苦生長裏的生命。昨天雖是運天風雨，可是到會的人依然不少，這足見熱心於教育的人士還是非常的多，誰說上海沒有眞正的藝術欣賞者？</p>

<h3>Japanese Forces in Southern Okinawa Dig Deep Defensive Positions in Shiri Area; Air Force Launches Another Surprise Attack on Enemy Airfield</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) – Japanese forces in the Shiri area of southern Okinawa Island are constructing deep defensive positions in the hilly areas of Gushichan, Tomigusuku, Yonagusuku, and Itoman. Morale is high, and they continue to fight valiantly. The enemy forces, having received reinforcements and reorganized, with the 7th, 9th, 16th, and Naval 1st Divisions, repeatedly launch fierce attacks on the front lines, attempting to break through the Japanese defensive positions head-on from Gushichan and Tomigusuku, hoping to decisively determine the outcome of the battle. The fighting in this area is extremely fierce. Since the Japanese forces' core defensive area on Okinawa Island, the area around Shuri and Naha, began to experience fierce battles at the end of May, two weeks have passed. The Japanese garrison, in an orderly state, fights bravely, causing the enemy's casualties to increase daily. From the beginning of June to the 10th, they have inflicted over 20,000 casualties on the enemy. Counting from the enemy's landing, the total number of casualties has reached over 73,500. The Japanese forces' indomitable counter-attacks have truly exceeded the enemy's expectations. As a result, enemy naval vessels have begun to provide covering fire and bombing again. Under these extremely fierce combat conditions, the Japanese garrison is further demonstrating its inherent spirit, preventing the enemy from shifting to the next phase of their operation. At the same time, the Japanese forces in the Oroku area, though surrounded by the enemy's 6th Marine Division, are still engaging in hand-to-hand combat, charging into enemy lines and causing the enemy soldiers to tremble with fear.</p>
<p>Ryukyu Islands Base, 18th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese air force launched a surprise attack on the enemy airfield on Okinawa Island on the morning of the 17th, dropping bombs with precision, causing explosions and fires in several locations. Over the past few days, in support of the land operations, the enemy has been using cruisers and other small vessels to bombard the Japanese positions on the southern tip of Okinawa Island. Also, on the 17th, about 200 enemy aircraft attacked the Ryukyu Islands.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Authorities Print and Distribute Combat Guidelines for Anti-Airborne Units</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Army Ministry's Directorate General of Education, anticipating that if the homeland becomes a decisive battleground, the enemy forces will inevitably use transport planes to forcibly land airborne troops carrying personnel and weapons, has printed and distributed concise pamphlets outlining combat guidelines for anti-airborne units to the Japanese military and national volunteer corps throughout the country.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) – Since the enemy forces began their invasion operations in the Pacific, starting with the landing operations on Guadalcanal and ultimately progressing to the Okinawa operation, they have suffered heavy losses, setting an unprecedented record in military history. Currently, having temporarily achieved their operational objectives, the enemy seems to be optimistic about landing operations on the Japanese mainland. However, the current Okinawa operation has completely shattered the enemy's optimistic views. The enemy's disadvantages are as follows: Their fleet of warships has suffered heavy losses, with over one-third of their naval strength destroyed by Japanese forces, and about one-half of their basic naval strength is in an unusable state. Therefore, when the enemy launches their usual landing operations, it will be difficult for them to quickly gain absolute superiority of local air power in the current Okinawa operation. Furthermore, in the next phase of operations, they will have to rely heavily on base air forces to replace aircraft carriers for air power operations, which will also face considerable threats. As a result, the American military is implementing an unprecedented air attack strategy based on base air forces, adopting strong aerial combat tactics. At the same time, the Okinawa operation has also given Japan the confidence to annihilate the enemy's landing attempts on the mainland. Moreover, the enemy forces in the Okinawa operation have experienced the power of the Japanese special attack units and suffered considerable blows. Unless they can devise effective countermeasures to stop such Japanese special attack tactics, their mobile units will have no possibility of advancing. The power of the Japanese forces in the Okinawa operation has not only made the enemy extremely cautious about landing operations on the Japanese mainland, but also strengthened our belief that Japan can achieve final victory.</p>
<h3>Residents of Sumatra Join Special Attack Units</h3>
<p>Sumatra Base, 18th (Central News Agency) – The magnificent and heroic spirit of the Japanese special attack units has deeply impressed the minds of the residents of Sumatra. Whenever the word "special attack" appears during film screenings, the entire audience spontaneously stands up to express their gratitude and their desire to build Sumatra. The local youth are greatly inspired, and recently, many have volunteered to join the Sumatra special attack units. The number of volunteers submitting applications to the volunteer army and the volunteer army support units continues to increase, now reaching over one thousand.</p>
<h3>Central and Military Affairs Commission Hold Commemorative Week</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency) – The Central Party Headquarters held the 254th Dr. Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week at 10:00 AM in the headquarters' auditorium. Members of the Central Executive and Supervisory Committees, along with working comrades from various departments and bureaus, and Kuomintang members from government agencies, totaling over 600 people, attended. Vice Secretary-General Dai Ze presided over the ceremony. Committee member Zhou Huarin reported on "Understanding Communism," which lasted one hour and was very detailed. The ceremony concluded at approximately 11:00 AM.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency) – The Military Affairs Commission and the General Staff held a commemorative ceremony at 9:00 AM. General Yang Zhen served as chairman, leading all staff members in the ceremony, which lasted half an hour before adjourning.</p>
<h3>Funeral of Japanese Prince Nashimoto-no-miya Yesterday</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) – The state funeral of the late Field Marshal of the Army, Prince Nashimoto-no-miya, was solemnly held at the Toyoshimaoka Cemetery on the morning of the 18th. Imperial envoys were dispatched, and representatives from the Empress Dowager's and Empress's households attended the funeral, adding to the solemnity of the occasion.</p>
<h3>People's Training Department Promotes Work</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency) – The People's Training Department of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang was formally established some time ago. Specific plans for promoting the New Life Movement are now being actively carried out and will soon be launched. Deputy Minister Wang convened a meeting of the directors of various sections on the 18th to discuss the direction of the promotion efforts.</p>
<h3>Yomiuri Shimbun Discusses Chongqing-Communist Friction</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) – The local Yomiuri Shimbun, under the title "Intensifying Chongqing-Communist Armed Conflict," published the following commentary: Recent noteworthy developments in the Chongqing area include the activity of the American-equipped Chongqing troops in Yunnan and South China, and the active armed struggle of the National Communist Army against the Chongqing troops. The equipment and command of the former are all American-style; therefore, rather than considering it an independent action of the Chongqing troops, it is more accurate to say that they are acting under American control. When the United States discovered that Yan'an was taking an aggressive stance against Chongqing, it responded to Chongqing's appeals by declaring non-recognition of the Yan'an regime and suspending arms aid, thereby making clear its attitude of solely supporting the Chongqing troops. This change in American policy towards China greatly irritated Yan'an and the Soviet Union, and they have been unsparing in their criticism of Chongqing. The recent rhetoric of the Soviet Union and its strategic actions regarding Xinjiang and Outer Mongolia are clear manifestations of this. At this point, the fact that Chongqing has the United States as its backing and Yan'an has the Soviet Union as its backing has been undeniably exposed. Therefore, we must recognize that both Chongqing and Yan'an, although situated within the East Asian region, both tend to rely on external support.</p>
<h3>B-29s Bomb Hamamatsu Yesterday; Incendiary Bombs Dropped Near Yokkaichi</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) – The Tokai Military District Headquarters announced at 1:00 PM on the 18th: Approximately 80 B-29s from the Mariana Islands base entered the area around the southern coast of the Shima Peninsula at around 0:45 on the 18th, gradually gathering near the mouth of Ise Bay. The first batch of approximately 50 aircraft advanced east over the Atsumi Peninsula, attacking the vicinity of Hamamatsu City with incendiary bombs for about an hour, and retreated southward over the sea from the vicinity of Tatekawa and Suruga Bay around 2:00 AM. The second batch of approximately 30 aircraft passed through the central part of the Chita Peninsula from Ise Bay towards the northwest, attacking the vicinity of Yokkaichi with incendiary bombs. A portion passed through the areas of Tsu and Matsusaka. During that time, the enemy aircraft acted intermittently in both areas with one or a small number of planes at a time, causing fires in various places within Hamamatsu City and Yokkaichi City, which were extinguished by around 5:00 AM. The extent of the damage caused by the air raid on both cities is currently under investigation.</p>
<p>Kyushu and Shikoku Were Attacked Earlier</p>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) – The Western Military District Headquarters announced at 10:00 AM on the 18th: 100 enemy B-29s from the Mariana Islands base, from 11:00 PM on June 17th to around 4:20 AM on the 18th, entered the Kanmon area and the vicinity of Kagoshima City with a portion of their force, while the main force entered the vicinity of Omuta City. Naval mines were dropped in the Kanmon area, and fires broke out in the vicinity of Kagoshima and Omuta Cities, which were extinguished around 6:00 AM on the 18th due to the efforts of Japanese military and civilian personnel. Damage to important facilities from this enemy air raid was minimal.</p>
<p>Osaka, 18th (Central News Agency) – Eight enemy B-29s, which entered through the Kii Channel at 10:00 PM on the 17th, dropped naval mines in the Akashi and Naruto Straits before retreating. Simultaneously, approximately seven other enemy aircraft, heading north along the Bungo Channel from the southwestern tip of Shikoku, dropped naval mines in the Suo Nada and Kanmon Straits before escaping. Furthermore, at 11:00 AM on the 18th, two PB4Y aircraft entered the southeastern part of Shikoku, operating in the Awa Nada and along the coast of Wakayama Prefecture before quickly retreating. Also, one enemy B-29, which entered from the Shima Peninsula, circled over the Kii Channel before retreating. En route, it conducted machine gun strafing in Inami and appeared to have dropped naval mines in Minoshima.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Current Situation in Europe and America and the Three-Power Conference</h3>
<p>More than a month has passed since the end of the European War, and the development of the international situation is not as predicted by most observers, not only failing to take a rapid turn for the better, but also exhibiting detours, twists, and even dangerous signs. In the past month or so, the San Francisco United Nations Conference has been fraught with conflicts, evolving into a confrontation between small and medium-sized countries and the so-called powerful nations. The fact that small and medium-sized countries dare to express a stubborn attitude at the conference is actually supported by Britain or the United States. Therefore, this opposition between large and small countries is actually an opposition between the major powers, namely Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France. If this opposition is not resolved, the so-called United Nations World Peace and Security Conference will not produce any results.</p>
<p>During the San Francisco Conference, the biggest incidents of conflict between major powers, in addition to the long-standing issues of Poland, Argentina, and the issue of colonial trusteeships at the United Nations Conference, the voting rights of the Security Council, regional security organizations, the issue of launching military sanctions against "aggressor states," and the procedures for passing the new League of Nations organizational charter, etc., recently, there have also been military and political issues between Britain, the United States, and Yugoslavia over the ports of Trieste and Graz, territorial claims between Britain, the United States, France, and Italy, armed conflicts between Britain and France in Syria and Lebanon, various disputes between Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France over the occupied areas of Germany, the issue of the transfer and treatment of prisoners of war between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and even recently, the dispute between Britain and France over Tangier in northwestern Africa. All of these issues involve the post-war struggle for spheres of influence between imperialism and socialism, the struggle for rights between imperialist countries, and the struggle for liberation between imperialist hegemony and small and weak colonial nations. The content is very complex, but the basic factor lies in the mutual suspicion and hatred between Britain, the United States, and France.</p>
<p>Recently, the most obvious suspicion between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union is the rise of anti-Soviet activities in British and American political circles. Particularly in British political circles, they want to restore the new European balance of power system centered on Britain after World War I, but this has provoked open attacks from the opposition party on the Churchill regime, resulting in the recent British political upheaval, the dissolution of the coalition cabinet, and the dissolution of Parliament on the 15th of this month, with political turmoil surging along with the election campaign. In the United States, the political struggle between anti-Soviet factions and Roosevelt factions has also begun, causing President Truman to feel deeply uneasy and forcing him to partially reorganize the government.</p>
<p>However, the severity of the international situation is constantly increasing. As a result, the call for a three-power conference of Truman, Churchill, and Stalin is growing louder and louder, attempting to use the three-power conference to resolve all of the above international disputes in a comprehensive manner. Because Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union have all agreed in principle to the three-power conference, Truman has made a painful decision to send Roosevelt's most trusted confidants, Davis and Hopkins, leaders of the American progressive politicians, to London and Moscow to lobby. Due to the active efforts of these two personal representatives of Truman, Churchill and Stalin have gradually expressed their willingness to cooperate in international policies. As a result, recently, starting with the Polish issue, issues such as the administration of the occupied areas of Germany and the disputes in the San Francisco Conference have gradually turned around, paving the way for the three-power conference. However, the fundamental contradictions between the three countries have not been resolved, and it remains to be seen whether continuous meetings will be of any help.</p>
<h3>Mr. Chen Binhe Returns to Shanghai and Discusses the Food Situation After Participating in the Deliberations</h3>
<p>Mr. Chen Binsu, a municipal advisory committee member of this city, returned to Shanghai yesterday after being summoned to Beijing by acting Chairman Chen of the National Government to participate in deliberations on the food problem. The reporter specially approached Mr. Chen, who was kind enough to make the following statement:</p>
<p>The Authorities Are Concerned About the Food Problem</p>
<p>Q: Was your trip to Beijing specifically to discuss the food problem? A: I have not been to Nanjing for fifteen years. On the 14th, I was summoned by acting Chairman Chen. Recognizing that the seriousness of the food problem has increased, I was very willing to contribute my humble opinion for the authorities to consider. Also summoned to Beijing at that time were Governor Ren of Jiangsu Province and former Ambassador to Japan Cai. According to my observation, in the past two weeks, all relevant authorities of the National Government have focused all their efforts on the food problem, and the Allied authorities are also very concerned. Therefore, with the common determination of the Chinese and Japanese authorities, they resolutely took emergency measures regarding rice and grain. We, standing from the people's perspective, express our admiration and gratitude. On the day the emergency measures were announced, it happened to rain, and the farmland was eagerly hoping for timely rain after a long drought. It can truly be said that "heaven helps those who help themselves."</p>
<p>Strive for Rational Control Techniques</p>
<p>Q: Now that the emergency measures for rice and grain have been announced, will the control of rice and grain be lifted in the future?</p>
<p>A: The current measures for rice and grain are temporary emergency measures. During this time of war, implementing economic control policies is inevitable in principle, especially in China, where political power is weak and the morality of some merchants has declined, requiring more rational economic control. In addition to participating in the deliberations in Beijing, I also exchanged opinions individually with various central authorities, the Allied embassies, and key personnel twice. All parties were extremely concerned about the food problem and unanimously agreed that, in the future, the control techniques must be suitable for China's national conditions and people's sentiments, and strive to be rational and reduce unnecessary suffering for the people. As for the specific measures, they are still under final consideration and have not yet reached the stage of being announced. Currently, after the emergency measures, the second major task is to suppress rice prices, starting with measures such as smoothing the rice supply, cracking down on hoarding, preventing speculation, and adjusting coarse grains, jointly carried out by the Chinese and Japanese authorities and civil forces.</p>
<p>There Is Absolutely No Speculation in the Beijing Market</p>
<p>Q: What are the recent rice prices in Nanjing?</p>
<p>A: When I arrived, the rice price was 480,000 yuan per shi (unit of dry measure). When I left Beijing by night train on the 17th, it was 240,000 yuan per shi. Once the supply source is smooth, it will definitely be lower again. Mayor Zhou of Nanjing has made great efforts to smooth the supply of rice and grain. The general livelihood of the people is also more stable, and the market is quite calm. Speculative activities such as gold prices and stocks in the Shanghai market do not exist in Nanjing.</p>
<p>Releasing Coarse Grains to Adjust the People's Food</p>
<p>Q: According to reports, the Allied military authorities have agreed to release as much of the wheat and coarse grains purchased previously in Shanghai as possible and distribute them to the people. When will this be realized?</p>
<p>A: On the afternoon of the 17th, when I was about to leave, I visited the Allied General Headquarters to inquire about this matter. They expressed their responsibility to handle it, and they will be able to provide a steady supply soon. I immediately expressed my gratitude on behalf of the citizens of Shanghai. At a time when military demand is urgent, the Allied military authorities are emphasizing the people's food. Not only have they stopped military procurement, but they are also releasing the purchased coarse grains for adjustment, which is especially commendable. I hope that the citizens of this city will not panic excessively about food, and rice prices may return to the previous levels. The Nanjing Chinese and Japanese authorities also believe that the surge in coarse grain prices in Shanghai along with rice is extremely unreasonable and advocate for strict crackdowns. This time, the Shanghai Coarse Grain Industry Association voluntarily issued a notice to its members to sell coarse grains at fair prices, which is commendable. However, there are still a few coarse grain merchants and outsiders hoarding and speculating. I hope that citizens will report them so that the authorities can crack down on them.</p>
<h3>Japanese Elite Troops Operate in Henan, Occupying Guanzhuang, Chadaokou, and Other Places</h3>
<p>Henan Front, 18th (Central News Agency) – Japanese elite troops in the Henan area launched a fierce attack on the troops of the First War Area of Chongqing at dawn on May 13th. On the 18th, after capturing Piankou, Wuhou, Xindian, and Wuhouyao, they captured Guanzhuang, a key point between Lingbao and Lushi, and Chadaokou on the 19th, leaving them with no time to reorganize their formations. In one fell swoop, they marched south along Lushi Street. On the 23rd, they occupied Shitai Mountain, Majia Mountain, and the western highlands of Baijiacun, north of Guandaokou, seizing strategic key points near Guandaokou. The Chongqing 40th and 38th Armies, at the key point of contact in Guandaokou, were in a miserable state due to the fierce Japanese attacks. The 90th Army was also rushing north from Lushi. At the same time, they gathered about five divisions of troops in the vicinity, preparing for a counter-attack. The Japanese army fought back at the Lushi Street position and inflicted heavy damage on a part of the 206th Division of the 40th Army that attacked Luotuo Slope, defeating them. At this point, the central axis of the Chongqing First War Area Army, which was calling for a general counter-attack, was completely thrown into chaos. From the beginning of the operation to the end of May, the verified total battle results were as follows: 1,074 bodies buried, 62 prisoners captured, and a large number of supplies seized.</p>
<p>Henan Front, 18th (Central News Agency) – Chadaokou, which the Chongqing side claimed to be unassailable despite repeated attacks, is a modern fortress throughout the mountain. However, after a single fierce attack by the Japanese army, it was breached. The terrain in that area is constructed with circular communication trenches and foxholes. The newly formed 40th Army was guarding the area, firing outward from the gun emplacements. From the night of the 17th to the morning of the 18th, the Japanese army suddenly launched a night attack and a dawn attack, daring to set up five-meter to ten-meter shelter trenches and forcibly broke through several points, with all members engaging in hand-to-hand combat and storming into the enemy's positions. At 9:00 PM on the 19th, the Japanese flag was finally raised high on the city walls.</p>
<p>Henan Front, 18th (Central News Agency) – Lushi Street, which is under Japanese control, is the main thoroughfare connecting Lingbao, Lushi, Xi'an, and other places along the Yellow River. It is the most important route for the Chongqing First War Area. The Chongqing army in that area, fearing its loss, successively gathered the reserve army from the eastern front of Henan and the second base in the rear. In this operation alone, the Chongqing side has deployed a total of three armies and nine divisions, attempting to prevent the Japanese army from advancing south. It also transferred approximately 300 wartime cadre trainees from the 40th Army to Chadaokou. In addition, it ordered the 53rd Division to gather in the Shugou Dong area, and the 90th Army is also gradually advancing to the front lines, hoping to reverse the decline.</p>
<h3>Movements of Chongqing Troops in Northwest Guangxi</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 18th (Central News Agency) – Chongqing troops in the northwest of Guangxi Province have shown signs of intensification in recent days. On the 8th, Commander-in-Chief of the Army He Yingqin and the combat commander of the U.S. Army stationed in Chongqing, Xin Keer A, inspected the area. At the same time, Minister of Transportation Yu Feipeng also flew to the area to inspect the conditions along the road, returning to Chongqing on the 11th. According to Chongqing Broadcasting on the 14th, Chen Tinghong, Director of the Southwest Highway Administration, went to Nandan, northwest of Hechi in Guangxi Province, on the afternoon of the 13th to inspect the transportation of military supplies to the front lines of Guangxi Province and the construction of various highways. Furthermore, Deputy Director Qiu Bingmin was sent to Baise for inspection. On the one hand, the 2nd General Team of the Wartime Transportation Administration Bureau Highway, stationed in Zhijiang, Hunan Province, was urgently transferred to northwest Guangxi Province. The 1st General Team was also ordered to be subordinate to the Southwest Highway and is currently moving from Kunming to Guiyang, indicating that the Chongqing army has strengthened its forces in that area and is preparing to launch a counter-attack on the Guilin-Liuzhou area.</p>
<h3>Strict Restrictions on Japanese Postal Items</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese government has suspended all postal services to Korea, the Kwantung Leased Territory, and Manchuria, except for postcards and official correspondence. Starting on the 19th, postal services to China, with the exception of letters, will also be suspended. The Japanese Ministry of Communications officially announced this on the 17th.</p>
<h3>San Francisco Conference Passes the Five-Power Compromise: Veto Issue Resolved</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) – The veto issue, the last major problem at the San Francisco Conference, has been resolved through a compromise among the five major powers: Britain, the United States, France, and China. Despite strong opposition from small and medium-sized countries such as Australia, the veto power was adopted in accordance with the five-power compromise in the vote on the 12th. The term "veto power" is not used in the International Charter. According to the Yalta voting method, any decision of the Security Council must be agreed upon by all permanent members, but the scope of this unanimity is not specified. In practical terms, if one of the five major powers opposes a decision of the Security Council, the decision cannot be made. To fully realize the function of the new international organization, the Allied nations, especially the five major powers, must cooperate. If one of them vetoes, and the other nations cannot accept it, the international organization will lose its meaning. Therefore, the Soviet Union's demand for the permanent members to have veto power can be said to be correct, but it clearly shows that the international organization relies on international trust. Therefore, the opposition of small and medium-sized countries to this plan is also natural, because if they do not express their opposition, it is tantamount to admitting that the International Charter fundamentally tolerates the absolute dominance of the great powers. Therefore, Australian Foreign Minister Rommel proposed an amendment that the veto power should not be invoked when deciding to use force, which was enthusiastically supported by New Zealand and other small and medium-sized countries, but ultimately failed. No matter what kind of international organization emerges after the war, it will only be a liaison mechanism for various governments to deal with post-war issues and international affairs. Unless it is an organization to oppress the weak within its scope, if the great powers act as they please, it will be the same as the old League of Nations, a mirage that disappears in an instant.</p>
<p>Differing Views Among Nations on the Functions of the General Assembly</p>
<p>Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from San Francisco: The Executive Committee of the San Francisco Conference held a meeting on the morning of the 17th to discuss how to handle the Soviet Union's opposition to granting the General Assembly of the future security organization broad powers of discussion. U.S. Senator Vandenberg, speaking on behalf of the four inviting nations at the Committee on Political and Security Functions of the General Assembly on the afternoon of the 16th, argued that the functions of the General Assembly should be limited to recommendations rather than discussions. Representatives from Britain, Ukraine, and the Soviet Union all spoke in support of Vandenberg's views. However, the committee meeting remained deadlocked, and the next session has not yet been decided. At the five-power conference on the morning of the 16th, Soviet representative Gromyko indicated that he would raise this issue again at the aforementioned committee meeting. Subsequently, the four major powers still approved the compromise proposed by Vandenberg. However, the small countries opposed this issue and will be discussed by the Executive Committee at its next meeting.</p>

<h3>All Members of the Indian Congress Party Executive Committee Regain Freedom: Simla Conference to Be Held Next Monday</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from London: British Secretary of State for India Amery announced to reporters on the 15th that the British government had released eight members of the Executive Committee of the Indian National Congress Party on the night of the 14th, seven of whom were Hindus and one was a Muslim, namely Acharya, the current chairman of the Congress Party. Of the fifteen executive members, seven have been released, and all members of the Executive Committee of the Congress Party have now regained their freedom.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) – Indian Governor-General Wavell, due to new proposals put forward by the British government, announced that a conference of Indian leaders from all factions will be held in Simla on the 25th. According to a dispatch from New Delhi, Jinnah, the president of the Muslim League, requested that the conference be postponed for two weeks in order to make contact beforehand, but Wavell sternly rejected this, stating that the conference must be held on the 25th, and that detailed discussions before the conference are not desired.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) – According to news from Bombay: It is heard that Acharya, the chairman of the Indian Parliament, has been invited to participate in the conference of Indian leaders to be held in Simla on the 25th.</p>
<p>Nehru's Speech Vigorously Criticizes British Policy</p>
<p>Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from Bombay: Nehru, who was released on the evening of the 14th, gave a speech on the 16th, vigorously criticizing Britain's hypocrisy policy as follows: "If India is not liberated, there will be no proper new world order. The basic goal of the Congress Party remains 'India's independence and freedom.' In a world where the strong consistently dominate the weak, India's independence is unattainable, but until four hundred million people gain freedom, there will never be a stable order in the world."</p>
<p>In addition to the famous Congress Party and the Muslim League, there is also a powerful party "All India Party" with a strong reputation. The representatives of this party have not been invited to participate in the Simla Conference. It is no wonder that the leader of this party protested. As the Simla Conference approaches, it can be seen that the political situation in India remains perilous.</p>
<h3>Dr. Haw-Haw Accused of Treason and Tried in London</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 18th (Central News Agency) – According to news from London: William Joyce (also known as Lord Haw-Haw), who is accused of broadcasting speeches for the Germans, was brought to Bow Street Magistrates' Court in London today to be tried for high treason. When Chief Magistrate Bridge asked him if he had any defense against the charge of high treason, he replied "No". When the charges were read, the magistrate asked him if he had any arguments, and he replied, "I have heard the charges read and will await the verdict. I do not want to add to or subtract from the confession I made in the military department." When the magistrate asked if he had any questions, he replied, "No." Joyce did not protest against being remanded for further hearing next Monday, so he stood in the dock for only a few minutes.</p>
<h3>Serious Political Situation in Belgium</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 18th (Central News Agency) – According to news from Brussels: Belgian Prime Minister Achille Van Acker has effectively resigned because he saw that King Leopold was about to return to the country. However, he announced yesterday that "I am not leaving the government and hope to continue as Prime Minister." This statement by Achille Van Acker is a clear indication that he is temporarily abandoning his authority in the hope that King Leopold will abdicate and not interfere in politics. The situation in Belgium has become serious.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from Brussels: The political circles in Belgium are very tense over the issue of King Leopold. It is rumored that if the King returns to the country, the anti-King faction will launch large-scale strikes and demonstrations. The Socialist Party convened a conference on the 17th to decide on reorganizing the government and issuing a notice to laborers across the country, demanding united action.</p>
<h3>Western Foreign Ministry Protests the Attack on the Train</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 18th (Central News Agency) – According to a Paris report received in London last night: Regarding the incident in Hendaye, the Spanish diplomatic authorities yesterday summoned a member of the French diplomatic delegation in Spain to lodge a serious protest. The report also stated that the French Consul General in Geneva, Gore, visited a hospital in Geneva to express his condolences to the Spanish soldiers injured in the incident and apologized for the unfortunate event that occurred. According to semi-official sources, a French newspaper published yesterday stated that it is hard to believe that the train attacked by French people at Hendaye station only carried soldiers of the Spanish "Blue Division" or members of the French Milice of the former Vichy government. The Spanish "Blue Division" in German uniforms has always been regarded by the French authorities as war criminals. The train actually carried Spanish diplomatic and consular personnel, workers serving in Germany, and Spanish residents living in Germany, who were eager to return to Spain via France. According to news received in Paris on the 16th, the demonstrators in Hendaye had issued a warning to the train departing from Switzerland, stating that the returning Spaniards included soldiers of the "Blue Division" and members of the French Milice. According to official news from Madrid, the train carried 448 people, of whom 61 were seriously injured and sent to hospitals, and 100 were slightly injured. A report issued by Spain stated that the train also carried Spanish people and their families who were engaged in commerce in Germany.</p>
<h3>British Aircraft Losses in the European War Exceed 16,000</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 18th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from London, the British Air Ministry announced on the 16th that British Air Force losses since the beginning of the war are as follows: 9,163 bombers, 3,558 fighters, 780 other types of aircraft, 2,111 tactical air force aircraft, and 1,479 coastal defense aircraft.</p>
<h3>Spain Prepares to Hold General Elections</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) – Spanish Head of State Franco recently announced that the Spanish government is actively preparing for general elections. According to a Reuters dispatch from London, the British press is paying close attention to the Spanish government's impending restoration of a republican system. However, Spain has no concrete preparations for a democratic system, so general elections to achieve this goal will not be easy. If the dictatorship of the Falange Party is not abolished and about 300,000 exiled politicians are not allowed to return, the general elections will inevitably be a mere formality.</p>
<h3>Goering Reveals German War Plans</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 18th (Central News Agency) – According to news from New York radio quoting sources from the U.S. military in Germany: Former German Air Force Minister Goering, who was captured by the U.S. Seventh Army in mid-May, said in a statement a few days ago, "Our German authorities originally planned to seize Iceland and the Azores, and also planned to attack Gibraltar from the rear via Spain."</p>

<h3>An Overview of Dongting Xishan</h3>
<p>— Lan Yu</p>
<p>Glimpses of Local Customs</p>
<p>Xishan is one of the areas for dispersing the population of Shanghai. Looking at Xishan, standing alone in Taihu Lake and surrounded by water on all sides, it is indeed a reasonably ideal wartime haven.</p>
<p>Xishan resembles the shape of a dustpan (簸箕). Its circumference is approximately ninety li, comprising eight villages and two towns: Donghe Town and Xiaoxia Town; Huili, Zhenxia, Qixian, Lucun, Qianwan, Dongyuan, Hanzhi, and Litang. Donghe Town is relatively the most bustling and also serves as an intermediary and transportation hub.</p>
<p>Currently, the entire mountain has a population of approximately 34,000 people, with farmers accounting for 70%, merchants accounting for 10%, and others such as fishermen, herders, and miners accounting for 20%. Due to its remote location, modern civilization has not been widely popularized, and feudalistic characteristics are very strong. At the same time, it has historically been spared from war and natural disasters, and its produce is abundant, enabling the people to be self-sufficient. This has led to a traditional habit of leisure and idleness. Outside of work, they pay little attention to worldly affairs, and most of their free time is spent in teahouses. However, the local customs are honest and simple, and the people are sincere and trustworthy. When faced with setbacks, they tend to attribute them to fate. Pedestrians give way to each other, and they value humility and avoid disputes, with very few urban habits.</p>
<p>Scenic Spots and Historical Sites</p>
<p>There are many scenic spots and historical sites, and historically, there have been many well-known figures from this area. For example, Xu Jin, the Minister of Personnel during the Jiajing reign of the Ming Dynasty, was from a prominent family in this area. To this day, his descendants are numerous, accounting for almost all of Donghe Town. The scenery is picturesque, with undulating mountains. Piaomiao Peak is the highest. When the weather is gloomy or on rainy evenings, floating clouds linger around the mountain peaks, creating a misty and distant mountain vista. At the foot of Piaomiao Peak is the Xuan Emperor Temple, which is very popular with pilgrims during the spring and autumn seasons.</p>
<p>The best scenery is said to be at Shigong Mountain, located on the lakeshore, with an ancient temple on top and lush trees. However, at present, bandits frequent the area, and tourists avoid it. In Zhenxia Village is "The Ninth Cave Under Heaven," which is very deep and extremely dark. Legend has it that it connects to Lingyin Temple in Hangzhou, and there are many bizarre myths. However, no one has ever reached the bottom of it. Although there are occasionally curious individuals who venture deep into the cave with torches, they are always deterred by the harmful gas inside and return halfway. In front of the cave is the Yue Temple, and behind the cave is the Cao'an Temple. From this location, one can see Dongshan, separated only by a body of water.</p>
<p>In Zhenxia Baoshan, there is still the Dayun Temple. Near Donghe Town Nan除, this is also the place of origin for the famous "Biluochun" tea. The monks here all serve guests with homemade fragrant tea. Nearby is the ancient Biluo Temple. According to legend, the reason why Biluochun tea is famous is because Emperor Qianlong visited this place during his travels in Jiangnan. The nuns had nothing to offer him, so they hastily picked mountain tea leaves,贴于胸口(directly translated to:贴于胸口), dried them, and made tea for Emperor Qianlong. After drinking it, the emperor praised it as good tea, with a milky fragrance, hence the name. The story is somewhat naive, but it is also quite humorous. In addition, there is also Tianfu Temple, which was renovated during the Wanli reign of the Ming Dynasty but is now in ruins. In Qixian Village's Fuyuan Temple, there are many ancient objects, such as a bronze bell, stone railing, and stone whisk.</p>
<p>Agricultural Production and Harvests</p>
<p>In addition to crops such as rice and wheat, Xishan's main products are silk and fruit. In addition, aquatic products are also abundant. In terms of agriculture, due to the limited amount of flat land, rice production is very low, only enough to meet the needs of the entire mountain population for two months. Cultivation and tools have not been improved much, and old methods are still used. The situation of silk production is far from what it used to be. According to the farmers on the mountain, before the incident, one dan of silk could be worth two and a half dans of 主. Now, it is only 时之零数. Farmers, seeing that there is no profit to be made, are cutting down mulberry trees for firewood. As for fruits, they are Xishan's special products, available year-round. For example, the recently marketed "White Shaobi Pear". Ginkgo and waxberries are famous products of the mountain. Loquats are everywhere in Suzhou and Shanghai around the Dragon Boat Festival, but they are not commonly seen on this mountain. This is because in recent years, the rural areas have been declining, and livelihoods are difficult. People compete to sell any small amount of produce to exchange for daily necessities and to fund agricultural capital.</p>
<p>Loquat Market Conditions</p>
<p>I once inquired with the local farmers about this year's loquat market, and they all shook their heads. Transporting loquats to Suzhou requires passing through about twenty checkpoints along the way, and the amount of expense is uncertain. Therefore, if the selling price locally is 300 yuan per catty, it must reach 700 yuan in Suzhou. When they transport them to the merchants in Suzhou, the merchants are aware of the farmers' situation and exploit their weaknesses, so they undervalue them. Although the farmers want to wait for a better price, they are limited by the need for food, travel expenses, and storage, as well as the fact that it is the busy farming season, so they have no choice but to sell at a loss. Therefore, although the price of loquats is high this year, it is fortunate if the growers do not lose money.</p>
<p>The new price for waxberries is 25,000 yuan. This year, there has not been much rain, and the yield is not abundant, nor are they as sweet and round as in previous years. Chestnuts are about to enter the market. Those produced in this volume are particularly fragrant, sweet, and large. Peaches are still rarely available. In addition, chestnuts, pomegranates, oranges, and cherries are produced in abundance. The above-mentioned fruit trees are planted all over the mountains. Every year in March and April when they bloom, looking out over the fields, the red and green colors are interspersed, and the fragrance is beautiful. Being in such an environment gives one the feeling of being in a paradise.</p>
<p>Coal Mine Conditions</p>
<p>The mineral resources are abundant. There are currently two coal mining companies, Shicheng and Shishan, each with just over two thousand employees. The workers are divided into male workers, female workers, and child workers, with three shifts a day, each working eight hours. The mining method is primitive. Shicheng has four shafts, and Shishan has one shaft, with a depth of more than ten zhang. Each cave has tunnels that connect them. There is a winch at the mouth of the shaft, with a long rope wound around it. When miners go down the shaft, several female workers rotate the winch. One end of the rope is tied to a hanging basket, which slowly rotates and descends. Each shaft is equipped with two winches, which take turns raising and lowering. When miners mine coal at the bottom of the mine, they first drill a hole at the bottom, then fill it with explosives, ignite the fuse, and detonate it. Therefore, the coal blocks that are mined are not large. The coal mined at the bottom of the mine is collected by child workers in carts and pushed along the tunnel to the nearest bottom of the shaft. Then, the coal blocks are transferred to the hanging basket and raised by the female workers above. The two mines produce more than one hundred tons of coal per day. Most of the coal produced is supplied to the Huazhong Electric Power Company. The wages of the workers in the two mines, calculated in terms of commodity prices, are currently around 5,000 yuan per day for each worker. The wages of female and child workers are 75% of that. In normal times, there are also low-priced sales, and their wages are higher than those of the staff.</p>
<p>Other mineral products include white clay (for making fire bricks and porcelain), alum stone (for enamel raw materials), yellow sand, stone materials (for making cement and lime), and manganese mines have also been discovered in Litang. It is said that the reserves are quite abundant, and once developed, the output will definitely be considerable.</p>
<p>Education and Public Security</p>
<p>Education in Xishan is extremely backward. Most farmers believe that farming can provide self-sufficiency, so they do not pay much attention to the education of their children. There are currently two complete district-run primary schools, eight village-run primary schools, and one or two private schools. The facilities are very simple. The total number of children enrolled in the district is approximately over one thousand. Public security is maintained by the police and the security team. The sanitary conditions are extremely poor. In the past, there were medical facilities, but they closed due to lack of funding. One was surgeon Jin Zhongkang, and the other was physician Juehua Temple 和尚. As for transportation, there are only rickshaws in the towns, and the number is small. In the villages, bamboo sedan chairs and flatbed carts are still used. There are no roads, and the widest streets are about five feet wide. Most of the public property consists of temples, followed by ancestral halls. The local houses are tall, spacious, and extremely sturdy, and some were built during the Ming and Qing dynasties.</p>
<p>District Administration Promotion</p>
<p>Since the new District Head Jin Baidi took office, recognizing that Xishan urgently needs development and is one of the areas for dispersing the population of Shanghai, he felt a great responsibility and spared no effort to promote government affairs. His work includes:</p>
<p>1.  Contacting relevant authorities to facilitate the supply of rice.</p>
<p>2.  Encouraging farmers to step up production and plant miscellaneous grains in unused mountainous areas.</p>
<p>3.  Training young farmers to strengthen self-defense capabilities and maintain local public security.</p>
<p>4.  Organizing literacy schools for farmers to instill practical knowledge.</p>
<p>In terms of dispersal, assisting the Shanghai Dispersal Committee branch in the local area, investigating the number of public properties and houses for use by Shanghai charities, schools, and population resettlement.</p>
<p>Dispersal Work</p>
<p>From the reporter's observation, dispersing the population of Shanghai to Xishan is quite appropriate. People from Shanghai have repeatedly visited the area for inspection. The mountain not only can accommodate a considerable number of people, but also has abundant resources. It is very appropriate to transfer Shanghai's capital to the area for development and construction. The following points should be paid attention to when preparing for dispersal here: public security, transportation, food, daily necessities, and the collection of furniture.</p>
<p>The local public security forces are weak. Although they are strengthening the training of strong young men, it is difficult to achieve results in the short term, and they also lack firearms. Taihu Lake has long been a den of bandits, especially since the war, with many firearms scattered around. There are many who take risks. Some are forced by livelihood, some are discharged soldiers and police, and some are bad elements. Taihu Lake is vast and easy to escape into, and their appearances are erratic, making it difficult to control them. If these lake bandits are not eliminated, the dispersal work will be affected.</p>
<p>Secondly, regarding transportation, there are several places in Taihu Lake and the inner rivers of Xishan where the water is very shallow, and flat-bottomed boats should be used. Furthermore, regarding food, the mountain's production originally only meets the needs of the mountain's population for two months, and the rest relies on external supplies. If the population of Shanghai is dispersed to this place, a large amount of procurement must be carried out in advance from various places, with at least three or four months' worth of inventory. In addition to rice, oil, salt, vegetables, etc., there must also be a considerable amount of storage. Again, daily necessities and furniture, etc., should be adequately prepared and transported in advance.</p>
<p>If the above four points can be resolved, then the dispersal work can proceed smoothly. (The End)</p>

<h3>Banks Supply Funds to Grain Merchants - Usage Must Be Proper - Financial Inspection Office Strictly Inspects to Prevent Hoarding</h3>
<p>Recently, rice prices in various places have been rising wildly day by day without any end in sight, especially in Shanghai. The government has decisively implemented emergency food countermeasures. Zhou Fohai, the General Manager of the Central Reserve Bank and Mayor of Shanghai, made the following statement on the matter yesterday:</p>
<p>President Zhou's Statement</p>
<p>"In view of the recent extraordinarily high rice prices, the National Government has decided to take emergency measures, temporarily halting the rice unification committee's purchasing activities, abolishing movement restrictions, and obtaining full cooperation from allied nations to suspend military rice purchases. After the implementation of these emergency measures, the source of rice supply will naturally be fully and smoothly provided, prices will gradually decrease, and people's livelihoods can be maintained. However, after the abolition of movement restrictions, it is difficult to guarantee that unscrupulous merchants will not engage in purchasing and hoarding, which will lead to a rice shortage, which will still be difficult to resolve. In order to strictly prevent these malpractices, I have ordered the Financial Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank to inspect the funds supplied by various banks to grain merchants to determine whether they are used for proper purchasing and transportation, and I have also ordered the economic police to secretly investigate whether there are any grain merchants hoarding and monopolizing. Once verified, they will be severely punished according to the law, without leniency."</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains Sold Universally at Fair Prices - Police Bureau Strictly Enforces - Economic Police Team Dispatches Investigators</h3>
<p>The Economic Security Section of the Fourth Department of the Shanghai Police Bureau and the Economic Police Brigade are actively promoting economic security matters, especially the strict management of prices. In accordance with the plans stipulated by economic administrative agencies such as the Economic Bureau and the Price Review Committee, and the strict enforcement of fixed prices, all illegal merchants who violate economic regulations or exceed the price limit are investigated and dealt with. Regarding miscellaneous grains, the Miscellaneous Grains Industry Association has formulated prices for red beans, etc., for and the people's livelihood, and has submitted them to the Economic Bureau for approval and implementation. Starting from the 17th, the association was instructed to order all member firms to comply with universal sales, with a temporary limit of five catties per person. The Economic Security Section and the Economic Police Brigade have dispatched personnel to investigate miscellaneous grain firms in all districts of the city. If there are any cases of exceeding the above-mentioned fair price or refusing to sell goods, they will be investigated and dealt with. The public can also openly report them.</p>
<p>Standard Pricing for Miscellaneous Grains</p>
<p>The Shanghai District Miscellaneous Grains Industry Association has, in accordance with the order of the Municipal Economic Bureau, stipulated standard pricing for the sale of miscellaneous grains for the needs of relieving the people's food supply. The standard pricing will be for fifteen days at a time, and no unauthorized increase is allowed, so as to make rice stable and suppress rising prices. The association notified its member firms yesterday to strictly comply with this. All retailers must absolutely not refuse to sell or increase prices, in order to maintain the people's food supply and emphasize public orders. The industry has been fully implemented yesterday.</p>
<p>Black Market Rice Prices Are Declining</p>
<p>In addition, in order to be concerned about the people's livelihood and with the understanding of the allied nations, the government has taken emergency measures to suppress rice prices and facilitate supplies, stopping the purchase of military rice, and the Rice Unification Committee has also stopped purchasing activities. Moreover, the allied forces' garrison authorities will sell wheat and miscellaneous grains purchased in Shanghai, so the people's minds have been calmed. The Economic Police Bureau has also received a clear order from the government to no longer restrict or crack down on the transportation of rice, allowing merchants and the people to transport it freely. Economic checkpoints in the suburbs have stopped restricting the transport of rice, so black market prices of rice are declining day by day. Especially due to the reasonable pricing and universal sale of miscellaneous grains, rice prices can be expected to decline day by day, and citizens need not worry.</p>
<h3>Improving Urban Transportation - Planning to Establish Public Horse-Drawn Carriages - Interview with Construction Bureau Director Xu</h3>
<p>Shanghai's urban area is vast and has a large population, but public transportation tools are becoming increasingly scarce. For example, when streetcars are restricted to certain hours and the French Concession public buses (i.e., red buses) are completely suspended, it is extremely inconvenient for citizens to travel. A Central News Agency reporter specially visited Xu Jidun, Director of the Municipal Construction Bureau, who said the following:</p>
<p>Establishing Public Horse-Drawn Carriages</p>
<p>The reduction in streetcars and the suspension of French Concession buses are all due to electricity and fuel shortages, which are unavoidable phenomena during wartime. The bureau is extremely concerned about the recent difficulties in urban public transportation and is currently encouraging car dealers to establish public horse-drawn carriages, following the example of Nanjing, to operate along routes and charge low fares for the convenience of citizens. The Shanghai Public Horse-Drawn Carriage Preparatory Office has drafted an establishment plan, including planned routes and fare tables, which has been submitted to the bureau and forwarded to the municipal government for approval. Once approval is granted, it can be implemented.</p>
<p>Managing Tricycle Industry</p>
<p>Tricycles are a newly emerging transportation business since the Incident and are also the most important transportation tool at present. In the past, it was stipulated that licensed tricycles must first have a fixed route before obtaining a license, which led to many abuses in the operation of tricycles without licenses. Now, in order to crack down on unlicensed monopolies, the bureau has formulated provisional regulations for the management of licensed tricycles, which have been submitted to the municipal government for approval and promulgation. In the future, whether tricycles are owned by companies or individuals, they can apply for licenses in accordance with the regulations. In addition, the bureau will strictly crack down on tricycle drivers who demand extra fees beyond the prescribed fares, and hopes that citizens will cooperate and report them at any time.</p>
<p>Attaching Importance to Rickshaw Industry</p>
<p>There are many rickshaws operating in the urban area. In the past, disputes often arose between labor and management due to rent and other issues. However, during this extraordinary wartime period, management should sympathize with the hardships of labor, and labor should also take into account the capital of management. Mutual understanding and cooperation are the only way to avoid disputes. The bureau attaches great importance to this issue and is constantly tightening and improving it with all relevant parties.</p>
<h3>Extra Distribution of Household Flour - Actively Preparing</h3>
<p>Rice prices in the city have been soaring incessantly, and ordinary people cannot afford to buy white rice, so most have switched to eating miscellaneous grains. Although the distribution of household flour can be carried out on schedule, it is still a drop in the bucket. The Shanghai District Flour Unified Distribution Office is extremely concerned about the pain of citizens due to the increased burden of food. It is now planning to organize an extra distribution of household flour to slightly alleviate the panic about the people's food supply and is currently actively preparing. In addition to requesting the Flour and Wheat Association to allocate a portion of flour, once the liaison with the relevant distribution agencies is completed and there are no other obstacles, it can often be realized within days.</p>
<h3>Sugar Allocation in Three Provinces and Cities - Continuing as Usual</h3>
<p>Since the China-Japan Sugar Industry Association has been in charge of the unified distribution of sugar, four phases of sugar have been distributed in the city. It is learned that all the sugar allocated to the three provinces and cities of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui is still being allocated as usual after consultation with the relevant authorities. As for the areas that cannot be reached due to transportation problems, efforts are being made to transport them.</p>
<h3>Police Bureau's Regulations for Hiring Staff</h3>
<p>Director Zhou of the Shanghai Police Bureau, because he inspected various branches, teams, stations, and institutes, found that when requesting to appoint staff members or fill the vacant positions, they directly submitted reports without considering the quality, which was a disregard for the essence of the police force. Although extremely good quality cannot be demanded, they should still seek reasonable quality, otherwise it is not bearable to make up the numbers with incompetent people. It is now stipulated that those who intend to join the police force must first be examined and approved by their respective units. If they are academically excellent and physically fit, they will be submitted to the General Bureau for examination in order to emphasize official duties. In addition, it was found that police officers who were to be examined only came for the examination after repeated notifications, and even when they came for the examination, most of them still did not bring photos, which delayed the process. In the future, when various branches, teams, stations, and institutes request to appoint staff members or fill vacant positions, they must instruct the persons concerned to bring their photos to the bureau for examination with the documents in order to expedite the process and avoid delays.</p>
<p>Two Chief Inspectors Transferred</p>
<p>It is also reported that Man Xijiu, the Chief Inspector of the Third Inspection District of the bureau's Inspection Department, and Xu 　　, the Chief Inspector of the Fourth Inspection District, have been transferred to each other. The two chief inspectors took office in their respective districts the day before yesterday.</p>
<h3>Hope to Report Malfeasance by China Railway Staff</h3>
<p>Recently, the China Central Railway Company has made significant improvements in maintaining order at stations and improving the ticket purchase procedures for passengers. The crackdown on improper behavior and discourteous actions by general company staff has also been particularly strict. According to the person in charge of the Shanghai Administration Bureau's Inspection Office, if China Railway staff members are found to be involved in malfeasance, if members of the public can cooperate with the company, report them as much as possible, or provide relevant information, then in terms of sanctions and inspection, it can be twice the result with half the effort.</p>

<h3>Improving Popular Reading Material - The Serial Survey</h3>
<p>— Sima Xiong</p>
<p>I believe that the serial comics on the streets are the publications with the most sequel readers. The readers of comic books have a really wide range, from middle school students, elementary school students, apprentices, small clerks, female workers, rickshaw pullers, to even garbage pickers wandering the streets, all are loyal readers of serial comics. Among them, most are children. The influence of the serial comics on them is tens of thousands of times higher than the textbooks in school.</p>
<p>However, what do serial comics give to children? Not long ago, a few children in Xujiahui left home to visit Taoist sites in Mount Emei. I think the force that motivated them was mostly serial comics.</p>
<p>It is undeniable that serial comics are popular reading material, especially the form of one side being a picture and the other side being concise text. In our country where illiteracy is widespread, it can indeed increase interest in reading and help in understanding the text. If used well, its effect is no less than that of popular education.</p>
<p>To improve serial comics and turn them into truly good popular things, the most important thing is to change the content. Some people think that changing the content will lose readers. This is wrong. If the change is good, it will not only attract the original readers, but also increase the number of subscribers, thereby achieving the purpose of popular education. First of all, I propose the following points:</p>
<p>1.  The authorities should take a stand on rectifying awareness, severely crack down on serial comics with absurd and strange content that can hinder physical and mental development, prohibit publication and circulation, and retain those with pure content.</p>
<p>2.  Various cultural associations, such as bookstores, newspapers, magazine publishers, and publishing companies, should use new forms and new content to publish new serial comics and sell them to small bookstores on the streets for the purpose of popularization.</p>
<p>3.  Publishers of serial comics should reform the content as much as possible, abolish gods, flying swords, and monsters, and use new characters as the protagonists of the stories.</p>
<p>In terms of content, what should replace those strange stories should be what the public really needs to read. Of course, the purpose of improving serial comics is not only to cater to the needs of the public, but also to improve the public's long-term standards. We cannot let that large group of readers always stay in the era of Huang Tiangang and Bai Yutang and must keep up with the times. For this reason, I believe that the content of new serial comics should include the following:</p>
<p>Narration of current events: such as the beginning and end of World War II, the San Francisco Conference, etc.</p>
<p>Evolution of society: on a small scale, such as the opening and recovery of the Shanghai Concession...</p>
<p>Life stories: countless tragedies in real life...</p>
<p>Historical stories: some of the most moving stories...</p>
<p>World knowledge: such as Arctic exploration, the invention of radio, African scholars...</p>
<p>I can't think of many at the moment, but I think that the knowledge that should be given to the public is correct, not just flying dramas and the like. As for students, if the textbooks can be visualized and illustrated, or even used for connecting (naturally improved) to replace the reference textbooks, I guarantee that the mood and interest in learning will increase thousands of times.</p>
<p>It seems that someone had already proposed improving serial comics, but until now, the same old stuff is still flooding the street stalls, unconsciously spreading toxins to the largest number of readers (and those readers usually only have this one reading material). I hope this time it's not just empty talk, because if even this cannot be done, then all education, especially popular education, is in vain.</p>
<h3>Fourth Issue of Gold Certificates to Be Released Tomorrow; Listing Price to Be Discussed and Determined Today</h3>

The listing price for this issue of gold certificates will be discussed and determined at a meeting to be convened today, the 19th, taking market conditions into consideration. Regarding the gold certificate market, it is currently under renovation. It will open as soon as the equipment is complete.</p>
<p>Central Reserve Bank Business Hours Remain the Same</p>
<p>To save manpower and resources, banks and large firms in this city, through a joint meeting of the banking and money industries, decided to shorten business hours by two hours. Starting yesterday, the 18th, the original business hours of 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM were changed to 9:00 AM to 1:00 PM only. It is now known that, considering the busy workload of the Central Reserve Bank and for the convenience of citizens, their business hours will remain unchanged, from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM, without alteration.</p>
<h3>School Water Usage; Relaxed Quotas</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of wartime water restrictions in this city, water usage by various schools has exceeded quotas, resulting in alarming monthly bills. After several negotiations between the Municipal Education Association and relevant authorities, requesting relaxed quotas and exemption from fines, the China Water and Electric Company has, after considering the actual situation of each school, approved the relaxation and, taking into account the financial difficulties of the education sector, agreed to postpone the payment of fines. It is reported that some schools have already received notifications from the company. Schools that have not yet applied can still apply to the Municipal Education Association.</p>
<h3>Hua Long Company Penalized for Falsely Reporting Business Tax Amount</h3>
<p>To eliminate tax evasion, the Municipal Finance Bureau has instructed the tax offices in each district to send personnel to investigate whether the declared spring business tax amounts reported by various businesses are accurate. It is now known that Zhong Xiang-sheng, a member of the tax office in the Taishan Road district, and Xu Ning-sheng, an investigator, discovered that the accounting books of the Hua Long Company Consignment Department at 486 Taishan Road were of two types, genuine and false. Just as they were about to interrogate the relevant parties, the person in charge of the shop, Zhao Yi-ming, issued two checks for 100,000 yuan each, intending to offer a bribe. The two officials considered this an intentional insult to public officials and immediately submitted the genuine and false accounting books along with the checks. After investigation by the tax office, it was confirmed that the company should have paid 258,238 yuan in spring business tax. After deducting the 2,324 yuan that had already been paid, they were required to pay an additional 255,914 yuan. After requesting instructions on the penalty portion, the bureau approved the determination of falsified accounts and imposed a penalty of eight times the tax due, totaling 2,047,312 yuan. The bribery portion was leniently waived due to the ignorance of the merchant, and the checks were returned. Zhong and Xu were not tempted by the bribe and were each awarded a bonus of 50,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Sports; Summer Soccer Invitational Tournament to Kick Off Early Next Month; Five Teams to Compete</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Football Association, recognizing that the soccer season has ended, but wanting to prevent the skills of the first-division players from becoming rusty, has initiated the organization of a Summer Soccer Invitational Tournament. Preparations are now complete, and the competition is scheduled to begin in the first week of next month. The participants include five teams: Lianyi, Portuguese Businessmen, Overseas Chinese, Shanghai Police, and Hualun. Donghua was not invited due to player injuries and departures from Shanghai, making participation impossible. Among the five teams, Lianyi, Portuguese Businessmen, and Overseas Chinese will participate with the same lineup as in the league. Roberts Stoff and Mickey Dunn from the Shanghai Police team have withdrawn, and several famous French army generals have been added. In addition to the core players Liu Zu-ru and Lang Shao-shan, Hualun has also recruited all the German businessmen players, making their strength considerable. The quiet soccer scene is about to experience another lively atmosphere.</p>

<h3>Water Cut Off in Cuilian Lane, Changning Road; Appeal for Relaxed Limits</h3>
<p>Cuilian Lane, 240 Changning Road, in western Shanghai, has a large population, but the water supply is insufficient, leading to excessive use. Recently, the entire lane has experienced a complete water cutoff, lasting for several days. Residents are forced to draw water from earthen wells for washing rice and vegetables, but the well water is murky and foul-smelling, and with the weather getting hotter, diseases are likely to spread. If no proper solution is found, the consequences will be dire. We urge the authorities to conduct an on-site investigation, consider the hardships of the people, and relax the water limits to maintain hygiene. We are filled with anticipation. (Residents of this lane)</p>

<h3>Report on Wanlan Middle School Concert</h3>
<p>Wanlan Middle School used a grand concert of Chinese and Western music to commemorate the school anniversary and to remember a year of growth amidst hardship. Despite the wind and rain yesterday, many people still attended, which shows that there are still many people who are enthusiastic about education. Who says Shanghai doesn't have true art appreciation?</p>
<p>The velvet curtain of Lanxin was drawn open amidst the sounds of the piano. The first piece was a solo by Miss He Yu-lin, followed by Miss He Yu-liang's violin and Miss He Yu-zhen's solo singing. The constant applause proved the high level of artistic accomplishment of the three sisters.</p>
<p>Mr. Yang Zhu-lin sang a bass solo, accompanied by Mr. Huang Yong-xi, a famous orchestra conductor, followed by Miss Xu Zeng-sui's soprano solo, which was melodious and lingering. Jin Sangzi Zhou Xuan appeared as a guest performer, accompanied by the famous composer Mr. Chen Ge-xin, complementing each other perfectly. Miss Zhou sang two songs, "Unchanging Heart" and "Phoenix Flying," which greatly excited the audience.</p>
<p>The second part of the performance was Chinese music. The first program of Chinese music was a collective ensemble of "浔阳夜月" (Xunyang Nocturne), followed by Xie Xiao and Sun Yu-de playing "平沙落雁" (Wild Geese Descending on the Sandbank). The highlight was Mr. Sun Yu-de's [missing character] [missing character] solo of "[missing character] Yin Ping Chu".</p>
<p>Everyone who participated in the performance this time was doing it voluntarily and was extremely serious. This kind of enthusiasm for charity is truly admirable. (Huang Ye)</p>
