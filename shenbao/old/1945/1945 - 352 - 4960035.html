<h3>蔚藍中星星黯淡　接收東北尙待連絡　國軍克北鎭續佔黑山</h3>
<p>〔本報北平二十四日電〕聖誕節前夕，遠眺東北，在一片蔚藍中，還有星星的黯淡，這是一個確實的消息：瑪林諾夫斯基表示不能協助國軍接收大連，因爲那不是他所管轄的軍區，所以哈長　市長都飛東北上任了，沈怡市長還在北平害牙疼。安東的接收，蘇方也表示不能派迎絡官協助，因爲那裏根本沒有蘇軍駐守。各省主席本來奉令於元旦前到達東北，目前限於事實，也許會展延到元月初，在國軍還不能大批的運輸分駐在各省之前，每一省主席赴任時，將派往少數軍隊作爲衛隊。上月十七日，東北行營遷平後，事實上他需要在華北的壤土上生根，現在他的轄區，南面擴張到德州，東面擴張到熟河，天津市也包括在內。客居北平的東北行營，不久就要三遷，天津錦州長春都有可能。熊主任說：要聽候主席的命令。主席在平時，東北的耆宿，一度雲集，北平張作相曾和王樹翰，翟文選諸氏，一度晉謁主席，共同談話後，主席曾把張氏留下，作長時間的單獨談話。綏包苦戰，頗著戰績的馬占山，在這裏也受着熊主任的優遇。這些對於將來的東北，也許不會完全無關。附帶應當報吿的，是除了長鐵一條大動脈而外，東北其餘的鐵路交通，差不多全麻痺了，因爲機車車皮奇缺，通常只有向長鐵沿綫運煤的車輛，在鐵路密如蛛網地區中的人民，也只好重新借重驢馬大車了。將來要使東北血脈暢通，機車車皮的需要，會是一個龐大驚人的數字。善後救濟東北分署長劉廣沛，今天怱怱飛長春了，他不去，善救總署分配救濟東北的衣服等物資，不會卸下中國的海岸的。東北武官的薪俸，也規定了，總說上將薪俸是流通券萬元，熊式輝大概也不例外。近來熱河省府人員到平的很多，劉多　主席，也份外忙碌，像頗有辦法。</p>
<p>〔中央社錦州廿五日電〕我軍廿三日克北鎭縣後，迅速前進，廿四日上午四時，佔領打虎山黑山。</p>
<p>〔中央社錦州廿五日電〕出關國軍，於完成第一階段接防任務後，自廿三日起，開始第二次進軍。各路部隊在零下二十度氣候，於一晝夜間，曾進展一百三十華里以上。先頭部隊越溝帮子以北之北鎭縣，進駐黑峙縣，黑山縣，收復打虎山，共產軍不攻自破。我方參謀與新民方面蘇軍接洽，一俟接洽就緒，我軍即可入新民縣，候命入瀋陽。</p>
<p>〔合衆社錦州廿三日電〕杜聿明將軍所部，已開始肅淸熱河之共產軍與雜色部隊。杜將軍之一部份軍隊，仍在等待蘇方之許可，凖備開入潘陽。而另一堅强部隊，則開始自溝帮子向北鎭推進，據稱：該處有共產軍一萬人以上據守。杜將軍擬於數日內佔領北鎭，然後向黑山推進。觀察家指稱：國軍之佔領此等遼熱邊區之城市，可將東北共產軍與其張家口新作戰根據地切斷，而熱河之控制，將使國軍獲得通往東北之許多陸上道路。</p>
<h3>北鎭居民空巷迎國軍　專家本週飛東北　長鐵監事會已舉行首次會</h3>
<p>〔中央社錦州廿五日電〕新民縣距瀋陽百十公里，杜長官抵溝帮子後，即督部前進，所經各村莊，均有民衆走奔來迎。抵北鎭縣時，昨夜隨軍入城之縣長于錦藩，率民衆二萬人，列隊城外歡迎。杜氏下車答禮，並加慰問。北鎭縣有人口七萬人，商店四百餘家，經共產軍三個半月之蹂躪，已十室九空。據鎭長及商會會長向杜氏報吿稱，共軍按戶派餉，每戶須繳五千元，商店繳款八十萬，銀行被派款一百八十萬。此外，北鎭縣煤汕糧食布匹等重要物資，均被刦走，全縣城公私損失，在一千五百萬元以上。</p>
<p>〔中央社錦州二十五日電〕錦州軍民，二十五日晨在運動塲舉行第一次民族復與飾。社聿明將軍主席，報吿民族復與節之意義。又電，今日此間天氣酷寒，雨雪霏霏，爲入冬以來之首次雨雪，豐年佳兆，軍民咸表欣慰。</p>

<p>〔合衆社北平二十五日電〕此間「益世報」暗示：蘇軍將長春移交國民政府代表前，已將大部份車輛運走。該報在一措辭極爲巧妙之論文中稱：東北唯一通車之鐵路僅長春鐵路，即在該綫上，所有之鐵路配備，均屬陳舊不堪者。日本人及僞滿當局所使用之新機車與華麗之車輛，已不見影踪。居住於長春城外之中國重物人物，必須乘馬車來往。</p>
<p>〔聯合社北平廿五日電〕東九雀於十四年來，備受日本壓制，今日慶祝第一個聖誕佳節，不受約束。東北物產富饒，因被日本侵略，致引起第二次世界大戰，迄今究屬蘇聯或中國管理，尙在暖味不明中。長春現有一中國市長，然其統治八十萬華人之權，仍緊於蘇軍，若無蘇軍支持，即不能執行命令。惟長春人民皆知此爲暫時性質，一二星期內即可重覩國軍蒞此。瀋陽。哈爾濱·大連三市長，已率同隨從人員乘飛機北上，籌備就職，僅大迎方面曾發生波折，蘇軍總司令馬林諾夫斯基尙須派一聯絡部隊，以引導國軍入市。據某報稱：馬氏謂大連不屬其管辖，故不能派遣連絡員引導華軍，實則東九省蘇聯當局曾與中國方面作外交接觸者，僅馬氏一人而已。熊式輝將軍於暫設此間之東北行營各主任會議中，通吿所有經濟技術專家，準備於本星期內飛往東北。中央銀行已在長春設立分行，職員三十人於昨日出發赴東北，一二日內，尙有第二批離平。</p>
<p>〔中央社錦州廿四日電〕東北行營參謀長董彥平，由東北保安司令部駐平辦事處李誠毅陪同，由平乘機來錦，代表熊主任向杜長官致慰問之意，並對東北接收事宜，有所商談。</p>
<h3>敎宗任華人爲樞機主敎</h3>
<p>〔合衆社二十三日羅馬電）敎宗庇護十二世今日公布新樞機主敎（俗稱紅衣大主敎）名單三十二人，內有中國主敎一人，亦已新膺樞機主敎之命，此爲天主敎會有史以來第一次以華人爲樞機主敎，各方咸認爲此乃中國國際地位提高之又一明證。</p>
<p>按新任第一華人樞機主敎爲今靑島宗座代收田耕莘主敎現年五十四歲。田樞機以一八九〇年生於山東兗州，一九一八年六月晉升司鐸，一九二九年三月入聖言會（即主辦北平輔仁大學之修會），一九三四年升山東陽榖監牧，一九三九年七月升陽穀宗座代鐸，授主敎銜，同年十月，由教宗庇護十二在羅馬祝聖，一九四三年調靑島宗座代牧。田樞機爲人慈祥雍　，此次膺樞機新命，不特爲我國天主會增光，抑亦爲國增光，各方咸表欣慰。</p>

<p>本約所稱「締約此方或彼方人民」字樣，在中華民國方面，係指依照中國國籍法，爲中國人民者。在荷蘭王國方面，係指依照荷蘭國國籍法，爲荷蘭人民者。</p>
<p>第二條　現行中華民國與荷蘭王國</p>
<p>條約或協定，凡授權荷蘭政府或其代表，實行管轄在中華民國領土內荷蘭人民或公司之一切條款，茲特撤銷作廢。荷蘭人民及公司，在中華民國領土內，應依照國際公司法之原則及國際慣例受中華民國政府之管轄。</p>

<h3>美報論美蘇遠東關係　馬歇爾酬酢頻繁　蘭達爾宴會上曾晤蘇大使</h3>
<p>〔合衆社紐約二十四日電〕霍華德系報紙前駐華特派員拉麼稱：馬歇爾任駐華特使，將成中國局勢之轉捩點，和平已　曙光矣。該特　員首稱：「在戰爭期中，共黨指蔣委員長爲法西斯者，其原因係共黨在渝發行之報紙受檢查之故，但實際上共黨活動並未受明顯之干涉，而國民政府擬在共黨區內發行報紙之請求，則反遭共黨拒絕。共黨終日虛張聲勢，自誇其戰鬬力，此種宣傳，係對美國而發，其目的乃在引誘我人放棄對國民政府之財政及精神上之援助。拉摩又謂：如美國對華已放棄其注意力，則蘇聯必將乘機而入，東北目前之糾紛，即係對美國之試探，但馬歇爾之新任命，已使局勢更變於且夕之間，蓋馬歇爾之任命，已表示美國重視中國方面之局勢也。</p>

<p>〔路透社莫斯科二十五日電〕此間外交界預料於聖誕節後，可有好消息獲得。美方人士昨稱，三强會議已近尾聲，良好之結果在預料中。會議所談若干問題，頗有進展。星期日夜三位外長赴波爾蕭埃劇塲觀劇時，莫洛托夫持貝文及員爾納斯之臂向觀衆示意，觀衆歡呼不已，此等現象，固爲莫斯科所難得一見者。貝文於散劇後赴法國大使館之耶誕招待會，曾領導外交官員高唱「我們聯合一致」之讚美詩，顯見異常愉快。貝爾納斯以略染感冒，未曾赴會。根據此種種現象，蘇京外交界人士對於此次三强會議，感覺甚爲樂觀。會議進展殊速，然一般人士仍切盼保持遞視之目光，對戰後一切間題，仍覓得一劑「萬應良藥」。負責方面曾謂，三强會議即使未有具體之解決辦法，然至少合作之機構，業已開始工作矣。</p>
<h3>克列姆林宮　歡宴嘉賓</h3>
<p>史達林並與貝文長談</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿五日電〕莫斯科電台稱，史達林元帥昨夜宴請貝文與貝爾納斯，其他賓客有莫洛托夫·英美駐蘇大使。紅軍將領若干人，及英外交次官賈德幹爵士。莫斯科電台又曾宣佈史達林在克里姆林宮接見貝文，蘇外委長莫洛托夫。英外次賈德幹。蘇駐英大使古賽夫·英駐蘇大使寇爾均在塲。據莫斯科來訊，英方發言人謂史達林與貝文之談話，「友好而有助力。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿五日電〕此閒外交當局昨日聲稱：據莫斯科最近消息，外長會議中互相折衝，煞費精古。又外交界稱，外長詳細討論之問題範圍廣大，以圖向世界發一文告，以揭開下月間聯合國機構大會之幕。</p>
<h3>麥克納重申　美對菲政策</h3>
<p>〔合衆社馬尼刺廿五日電〕最近訪華之美駐菲專員麥克納宣稱：「外傳本人曾謂菲人不願獨立，不確，此說僅係報道而並非正式·美國對菲列濱之政策異常明　，我人已允在一九四六年七月四日給予菲人以獨立，菲人若不願獲此地位，其主動應屬于菲人，美國絕不採取主動。菲列濱之獨立已不成問題，我人之工作厥爲如何爲菲人準備獨立，我人不能離開此種目標而努力」。</p>
<h3>處菲奸不澈底　美表示不滿</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據舊金山廿五日廣播稱：菲列濱對於懲處菲奸，不甚澈底。菲參議院主席與總統候選人羅薩斯，爲「曾有一時爲日人收買軍米之主腦人物」，在日軍佔領時期，羅氏爲菲列濱經濟委員會主席。而參院議員大多數均曾與日本合作。此間晚報宣稱，美方對於菲當局遲未懲處菲奸，極爲憤怒，目前菲政府與菲人若不立即肅淸「合作份子」，前爲日人奔走之羅萊傀儡政府人員，必將全部恢復其權力矣。菲烏自由派人士指稱，除非美國參加懲處菲奸工作，則菲奸必可逍遙法外，良以目前執政者均係菲奸之友也。</p>
<h3>奧地利總理　發表施政大綱</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿五日電〕奧地利總理費格爾在議會發表施政大綱，力陳使天主敎人民黨及社會黨合作之決意及辦法。費氏認爲第一次奧地利共和國之失敗，即係兩黨不能妥協之故。奧新總統倫納博及副總理夏爾特博士亦均具同感。費格爾謂選民雖願意有自由企業，然而國家控制企業，目前實具必要，而特種企業甚至應由國營，良以奧國之重要工業，多被納粹盜走，故非由國家　制，不能迅速恢復。敎育方面應注重靑年之民主思想訓練。</p>
<h3>日外相吉田施展手腕　陰謀離間各盟國　邀請英籍記者午餐攻擊美方在日施策</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京廿五日電〕日外相吉田茂爲被佔領下日本所推行之新外交政策，即爲離間各盟國使互自爲敵。此無外交手段之老外交家，業展開此陰謀之第一步，企圍以英制美，俾「軟化」盟國之對日政策。吉田初則使情報局官員出名，邀盟國記者中之兩愛爾蘭籍記者午餐，其女旋向此二人即路透社駐東京特派員史密斯及倫敦新聞紀事報記者　安，發出正式請柬邀赴午餐，且附註「其父届時亦在座」。史雷兩人應約前往時，首由吉田之「私人秘書」即與故近衛文麿密切有關之白瀨接迎，渠稱，「倘君之美國同業，日後詢問何以得與吉田外相共午餐，請君可答以此係由吉田之女公子相邀者，而吉田外相亦在座。迨午餐時，向以生性痛恨記者之吉田，居然異常健談，渠稱，天皇近甚憂慮麥帥之批令日見嚴厲，日後定將有事件爆發，而無米可食，即可成爲變亂也」。吉田作此警吿時，席中有雞蛋麵及炸龍蝦，及烤牛肉，以及牛油等，均爲東京兩年來所未見者，且有新鮮蔬菜，及密桔佐餐。吉田旋突以其特有之率直口吻稱，「是等指令，皆出諸毫不明瞭日本情形者之手筆，美國之專家誠如過江之　」。吉田隨詢問英法及歐洲其他各地，是否有反美之言論，渠暗示倘有英人在日，則一切事物當迥然不同，蓋渠等明瞭遠東情形也。吉田旋即吿辭退席，前往參加重要會議。其秘書於散席時稱，「君等俱愛爾蘭人，當深知被佔領國家中人民之情緒也。」孰知吉田女公子所邀之憤怒之貴賓，已將上述經過，報吿麥帥總部。總部之高級人員評論稱，「此項事實，與目前日本內閣之觀念巧合」。日本產業經濟報今晨之社評中稱，日本官員刻誇大日本之種種困難，以及韓國北部及東北之日僑所受種種困難，以設法掩蔽其本身之錯誤及無能。該報並指責前任職於大東亞省現已解散之官員，於投降後之艱難急緊之時忽略其職守，而使日本人民進退維谷，不知所措。渠等刻復企圖曲解事實，以掩蔽其溺職情形，而將韓國及東北各地日僑之困難歸咎於蘇軍。</p>

<h3>蘇聯重視　托管制問題　聯合國機構大會準一月十日開幕</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦二五日電〕莫斯科電台政治評述員勒明廣播稱：聯合國機構籌委會之工作，在良由國家之歷史上，佔有重要之一頁。籌委會最重要之議程，即爲託治問題，此乃戰後最重要之問題。殖民地制度乃國際糾紛之原因，對於聯合國機構之工作，亦必大有阻碍。目前殖民地人民之民族意識，已逐漸滋長，印度，爪哇，越南，及中東等國之人民，固英不舊起作自由之戰。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦二十四日電〕聯合國機構第一次全體大會，定於明年一月十日在倫敦正式開幕。大會將選舉一秘書長，及安全委員會，經濟社會委員會與託管委員會之臨時委員，聯合國機構始能積極進行。第一次會議中棘手之政治問題，原子炸彈即爲其一，並有若干小國已通知將繼續抗爭五强在聯合國機構中佔據優越地位。</p>

<h3>敎皇耶誕獻辭　建立永久和平三項基本條件</h3>
<p>〔合衆社梵蒂岡廿五日電〕敎皇於聖誕前夕，向全世界廣播，略謂，目前世界並無和平，而僅有「戰後」兩字而已。就正　永久和平而言，敎皇提出以下三點：（一）目前需要合作。善意，及各國之互信。（二）一切監導選舉者意志與思想之檢查民意制度，必須予以斥責。（三）世界各界必須促使極權國家立即中止其霸道主義。</p>
<p>國際需善意互信極權民主不兩立</p>
<p>〔路透社電〕敎皇之廣播詞全文如次，「集權主義與眞正而健全之民主制度，不能並立。集權政體已將大地用鮮血染成紅色，國家之生存爲其破壞，而世界永遠離不了戰爭的威脅。今後和平的機構，應以消滅侵略意志，剷除侵略勢力爲目的。不論對內或對外之獨裁行動，應當一律制止。在這紛亂的世界上，祗有一條解決之路，就是回入上帝的懷抱，服從上帝的意志。戰爭雖已結束，可是世界並沒有進入眞正的和平，和平不過尙在準備的階段。從古以來未有較此次担任恢復和平的人所負責任更重大者。人類今已覺悟智慧，忍耐，與善意，對於世界之和平與秩序，具有如何重大的關係」。敎皇繼稱，「敎會之超自然性及不可分性，正如耶穌基督之本身。基督之整個性，意即頭部與軀幹之必不可分離，此乃生命之整個性，不論何時何地，可以適用於任何人類。故如有使敎會成爲任何民族之俘虜者，實爲對整個人類之侮辱。目前之局勢，需要各種密切之合作，减少政治之競爭。欲保全今後之自由，必須增强個人內心之力量。人與人之間，以及國與國之間，均須充分合作。所謂輿論民意，不可爲金錢所操縱，必須尊重眞正而自由之大多數人意志，決不容獨裁與武斷政體之存在。今年吾人於慶祝聖誕之際，已可毋庸恐懼陸上·海上。及空中之威脅，六年來此爲第一次眞正歡樂之聖誕，吾人應當感謝上帝」。</p>

<p>〔路透社巴達維亞廿五日電〕荷蘭通訊社稱：萬隆區之極端派直領哈特傑，業已戰亡。哈特傑常向印度尼西亞人出售神符，以爲備此符可母患一切，哈氏旣死，印度尼西亞人始信神符亦不過如此耳。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴達維亞廿五日電〕英軍空輸部隊昨在本城郊外克賴馬特區搜索時遭印度尼西亞極端份子襲擊，傷十人，英軍俘獲二十五人及軍器軍火若干。惟印度尼西亞人民似已不復恐懼極端份子。萬隆方面印度軍正在肅淸該城東南區，星期日曾俘獲七十人，內有數人係「黑牛」會會負。萬隆與巴達維亞間之布登索難民區內盟軍旅本部，遭手溜彈襲聲，迄週五爲止，盟軍共死一六大人，傷七九五人，失蹤一六三人</p>

<h3>美全國狂歡　在表面欣快中難掩不安情緒</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約廿四日電〕五年來美人首次舉行平時耶誕慶祝，據聞彼等正準備將此次耶誕，作爲珍珠港事變以來最快樂一次之慶祝。百貨商店售賣耶誕禮物之忙碌打破紀錄，郵局所寄之耶誕賀片包裏，亦爲數最多。假期旅行之擁擠，在美國亦爲史無前例。聖誕晚餐時美人可享肉五磅，凡此種種，僅有在此參戰國家中之最幸福者使戰爭影響最小之美國，始有可能。然在表面之欣快中，仍有不安之情諸。今日各報之耶誕頌辭，僉以世界大部份到處　漫悲慘與不幸，喚起美人注意。値此世界幾普被災難之時，美國雖能享受富裕之福，但絕非並無內政外交問題之困難。例如國內勞工之罷工仍在進行，工業之復員特別緩慢，消費品仍然缺乏，尤以衣服一項爲甚。慢性之通貨膨脹仍在繼續，而房屋之缺乏更日趨嚴重。故美人慶此一九四一年以來首次平時之耶誕時，某種種條件雖較世界其他各國爲優越，但亦正如其他各國不能不產或恐懼與希望。</p>
<h3>巴頓長眠地下戰績永垂不朽</h3>
<p>〔路透社林特堡二十五日電〕巴頓將軍遺置昨在莊嚴之儀式中，安葬於慮森堡附近之漢姆美軍公墓，美軍人員參加葬典者千名，居民夾道而觀者不少。</p>
<p>〔聯合社特稿〕巴頓將軍以吉普車失事受傷，上星期卒以傷重不治去世，巴頓將軍爲三十除年之老戰士，治軍以紀律嚴明稱。將軍在職業軍人中，天才奕奕，即同袍往往爲之驚異，一手使坦克戰術造於化境。但有涉及外交之事，則應付無方，時時處於窘境。將軍在第二次世界大戰中，自非洲輾轉法德奧捷諸國，戰無不勝，攻無不克。在菲洲戰役中，將軍已嘖嘖爲人稱道，蓋相傳征服突尼斯時，曾腰懸柄　珍珠之手槍二柄，咆哮如虎，爲坦克車率先衝鋒，將軍履險如夷，時時臨前綫，以爲此係軍官特權。其作戰要訣，有下列警句：「吾人須不斷向敵人進攻至筋疲力盡而後已，於是再行進攻」。第三軍係於侵入歌陸旱成立，戰績彪炳，即係應用上訣之結果。</p>

<h3>耶誕節在柏林　屠刀斫樹枝取火禦寒塗油黑麵包聊充大菜</h3>
<p>〔聯合社柏林二十四日電〕在此間德國某公共建築前，貼有吿示曰：「僅死於傳染病者可得棺木」，其旁則爲一硬紙板製成之大使，上稱「恭祝聖誕，願地上平安，人人樂善」。此即今年柏林耶誕之景象。往年此德國首都亦嘗縱恣狂歡，納粹軍人鵝步遊行，不可一世，但今則觸目凄凉，所見惟敗瓦頹垣眼球深陷之人民，雖感謝和平來臨，但瞻望前途渺茫，又塔然若失。動物園曩爲市中心著名公園，有老年男女以疲憊步伐，牽數車而出，車上滿載樹枝，彼等於道旁小憇時，取出上塗豬油之黑麵包食之，此即彼等之聖誕大菜矣。昔日壯麗之園中，今則見婦女衣貴重皮毛外衣，以屠刀亂斬樹上殘榦，拾取碎木片作禦寒之用，此種景象並不調和。同時在市政大厦內，有衣服單薄面色灰白之兒童，等候舉行聖誕老人大會，內中頗多在戰時因轟炸成爲殘疾者，每人可取得玩具一件，暖衣若干，及略有糖屑之食物一片。市內舉行「救救兒童」運動，至少尙有些須成就。街頭見一虛弱無力之老人，在百葉窗上黏貼布條，並喃喃自語，謂夜來窗上紙板跌落，其　臥牀，以氣喘叫苦。窮苦人家今年大多無聖誕樹，携至市上出售之樹，雖有數千株，價在一至八馬克之譜，但多爲願意出二十倍此價者購去。</p>

<h3>故都的耶誕　八年來第一次沒有威脅屈辱</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿四日電〕八年來這是北平市民第一次在沒有威脅屈辱下面，來迎接聖誕節，但是這裏的聖誕節，並不是皆大歡喜，借用別人一句話，北平至今還是一個龍城，雖然這個　一天天在擴大，　城裏千千萬萬外縣住戶，在勝利之後，依然困居北平，不能返回自己的荘圃，多少多少等待了八年以後，日日倚門而望，還不見流亡子女的歸來。工廠在接收以後，多數停止　烟，失業的工人，不消　，都在　寒　上掙扎，就是各機關留用的人員，在試用時期將滿之後，也都爲吃不飽的飯碗擔憂。美國孩子雖擁北平小姐，啖美肉鍋子而遙念遠隔重洋的妻子，也會悲從中來，但最不愉快的要算鎯鐺獄裏的王蔭泰，王克敏輩了。他們在想着去年此夜，正在通宵豪賭，或者玩女人呢？</p>
<p>主席來得太早一點，不然他要作北平的聖誕老人了，他給故都的人民帶來了公正和溫暖，而且特別給辛辛學子撥了過冬的糧食和煤炭，他給北平人民撒下了永久的懷念。張溥泉。鹿瑞伯兩老適逢其會，作了一九四五年故都的聖誕老人，他兩的背的大口袋裹是肥皂，洗去了淪陷區人民臉上不應當有的汚穢，鹿安慰華北同胞說，除去少數漢奸外，不管是後方或淪陷區，每個人對勝利都有相當貢獻，張說的更得民心，所謂僞字，本人認爲自今日起即應取消，我們只問奸不好，根本談不到偽不僞。這肥皂對淪陷區人民是最貴重的禮物，三個月來不明道理的亂用僞字，己太使人傷心了。聖誕節之夜，除了美軍和少數人士的通宵舞會，時時從高樓裏傳出了樂聲，一般市民早已入睡了，他們也許在夢着善後總署不要稅的麵粉，布疋已經送上家門了。</p>

<h3>光復後的天津　正在走向復興繁榮之途　本報編譯室譯自二十四日大美晚報</h3>
<p>光復後的天津，其面目鮮有變更，根本上和戰前情形差不多。美國海軍陸戰隊的各式車輛，在天津市街上風馳電掣，每輛吉普卡都各有一個心裁別出的車名。</p>
<p>第三水陸兩樓部隊總部，就設在前法租界工　局巨厦內，各團部與各級軍事辦公處，散佈全市，身穿皮領冬季制服和短皮外套的美國軍人，到處異常活躍。天津的英文路名牌，全部被日人拆走，取而代之的，都是些木製的板牌。</p>
<p>物價低廉　仍用僞幣標價</p>
<p>天津的物價，遠較上海便宜，可是在天津人看來，却已經很貴了。舉一個例：猪肉，每磅衹售國幣二百二十元，北方的主要食糧—麵粉—比上海貴一些，每磅約需國幣一百四十元。麪包每磅要國幣一百十六元左右。塊頭煤，約需國幣八九千元一噸。開灤煤礦公司，並不和從前一樣，他們的煤，是並不賣給私人的。　　天津「老鄕」標價，仍在用偽聯銀票。如果用國幣標價，他們也會立刻把它五作一折算過來。街上的兌換商，爲了某種原因，都不大歡迎關金券。</p>
<p>電報交通　尙待積極調整</p>
<p>華北的交通，依然沒有暢通。天津上海間還沒有正式固定的交通辦法，偶或有船只啓航的話，也都由軍事委員會統籌辦理。有三百噸左右的小船若干艘，往來於津靑之間，不過那些船隻之航行，在目前，尙未能絕對保證共安全。</p>
<p>中航公司暫未售票與普通旅客。能允許搭乘中航機的，都是軍政界的人員，電報方面，也還沒有十分可靠，從天津拍一次電報到上海，往往要一天半到兩天才能送到。</p>
<p>美商銀行　准開往來戶頭</p>
<p>在十二月二十號那天，兩家美商銀行天津分行，大通銀行和國營紐約市銀行復業開幕，大通銀行經理費爾特，會計主任史密特，紐約市銀行經理托萊，會計主任亨利，都收到親友和老主顧們不少花籃禮品，登門道賀的人也很多。兩行的儲蓄戶頭還沒有開，祇開國幣或美金的往來戶。以前的老戶頭，需要特別聲請許可證，方可解凍，津滬間國幣滙兌，還沒有開始辦理。據托萊氏宣稱：「我對於將來很樂觀」。</p>
<p>軍刀暢銷　一般市況平平</p>
<p>目前許多在天津復業的老公司，開着等於沒有開，簡直沒有生意可做。華北內地，和平津兩地完全隔絕，所以照種種情形看來，進出口貿易一時都無法恢復。大部份天津八，對於馬歇爾特使來華，寄以滿腔熱望。可是一小部份人，對於將來覺得十分悲觀。</p>
<p>今日的天津，好像是一所酒吧間和古玩舖的城市。他們的貿易對象，便是那些美國兵士們，兌換外幣的買賣很發達，尤其在前英租界內維多利亞咖啡館的四過，最近因爲氣候嚴寒，成交額難免受影饗。街上小阪們所賣的東西中，當以日本軍刀銷路最好，因爲美國士兵是最喜歡獵取各種紀念品的，其實那些日本軍刀是否眞的道地「戰利品，」頗可懷疑，即使是日本的軍刀專家，恐怕也鑒別不出吧。據估計，美國軍人在華北所化去的錢，到目前爲止，大約有美金七百萬元。在天津，北平，靑島，秦皇島，所化去的數且特別多。</p>
<p>天津市政府最近出了一張佈告，禁止男女兩性同坐人力車，這一點，對於軍人們是相當掃興的。假使上海的軍人們聽到了這個消息，一定會有特別的感興，同時希望在上海別也來這一套。</p>
<p>黃金美元　市價低於滬市</p>
<p>津市銀行，無論中外，對於天津上海和華中其他城市間的滙兌，都不經營，因爲這種資金調度的困難，和交通方面的困難，天津黃金美元的市價趨勢，比上海市塲低，所以很可能有不少人在滙劃方法上活動，調濟頭寸。津市美金票現在國幣九百八十元左右，但其漲落的程度，較上海市塲上爲劇烈。</p>
<h3>電梯開到一半路程，頭髮燙到　一半光影——電流突然斷了！　法國今冬渡難關　譯自美新聞週刊社長卡洛爾原文</h3>
<p>法國最近政潮突起，自通過信任政府案後，始吿段落。議會將以七個月的時間來研究制憲。在此期間，政治方面無事可爲，於是法國政府就開始靜下心來，考慮怎樣過冬的問題了。　高樂總統每天辦公，到得很早，走得很遲。唯一可以看得出的變化是他已經脫下軍裝改穿便服了。　高樂和法國民衆本年冬委所遭遇的最嚴重的難關將是煤荒和節電。</p>
<p>一個煤塊　等於一隻金元寶</p>
<p>兩輛木炭卡車，在馬路上互撞了一下，有幾袋煤從車上震落到街邊。一個小孩子發狂似地呌了起來：「媽媽，媽媽，這兒有煤！」於是，一刹那間，就有大羣的人聚集過來。許多人兩手抓滿了煤，連蹦帶跳地逃了一開去。一位尊嚴的老翁，拾起一塊煤來，帶着回憶的神氣，對牠讚美着，好像牠是一只美麗的貝　或是一只金元寳似的。</p>
<p>沒有一個法國人不注意煤。報紙上的大字標題，都是關於煤。英國軍隊裏的一個女兵，發見她的女僕在偸煤，她從煤倉裏把煤一塊一塊地夾帶在手提包裏，陸續偸出去，到後來幾乎被她偸去了半噸之多。目前黑布煤價在美金一百八十元至二百四十元之間，還是不容易買到。</p>
<p>叩門不應　拾起石子打玻窗</p>
<p>爲了煤荒，必須節電，爲了節電，每天要斷電好幾次，每次一小時。電梯開到一半，電流斷了，把乘客吊在不上不下的地方，至一小時之久。理髮店裏，燙髮剛燙到一半，電流斷了，燙髮機把女客的頭髮拉得根根直緊，一動也不能動。電話是更忙了，因爲每天有很長的時閒，沒有表軌聲，電鈴撳不響，叩門的人，只好拾起塊石子來打玻璃窗。法國人每天得記住什麼時候有電，什麼時候沒有電，須處處小心，時時注意，因此，他們一半的時閒與精力，都彼浪費在這上面了。　承平時，遇着天氣久旱不雨，影響到水力發電，以致電流不足旱，足可以用煤來補救的。自從法國得到解放之後，法國的煤業界，立刻就英勇地努力工作，以恢復本國的煤礦，並使薩爾區的煤礦復工。常然，機械的敗製，礦工的衣食不周，和坑穴撑木的缺乏，都是重大的阻礙。然而，煤的產量仍在不斷地增加着，到現在，每天已經能够出煤十四萬七千噸，即每年能够出煤五千三百六十三萬五千噸，超過平時產量，的有六百萬噸之多。</p>
<p>緊急措施　嚴禁商店用電燈</p>
<p>可是，法國在承平時代，每年需輸入二千萬噸煤，而現在却不能輸入這末多，來補足本國所欠缺的數量。例如，九月份從美國輸人的數量是四十萬六千七百噸，到了十月份，由於美國礦工罷工的結果，却低落到三十八萬零二千噸。更糟的是，法國不能從魯爾區獲得預期的煤量。十一月份預期能獲得三十一萬三千噸的，但截至十一月十六日爲止，還祗收得八千七百噸。</p>
<p>巴黎市政當局，在這樣尷尬的局面下，不得不採取新的緊急節電辦法。凡非主要工廠，每星期只許開工三天。家庭和辦事處，除中午二小時外，絕對不准使用任何電流。商店樹窗，禁止使用電燈。一切商店，除伙食店和藥房外，必須在下午五六點鐘打烊。地下電車，也提早一小時進廠。執筆至此，譯者倒有幾句話要附在這裏：</p>
<p>目前巴黎的景况，使我們回憶起勝利以前的上海來。那時，上海也在施行着緊急節電辦法。多數工廠，不得不因電力停止供應而關閉起來，或是設法裝置木炭引擎，作爲替代。同時，日軍的軍需工廠，却在日夜不停地開工。在防空措施之下，馬路上是漆黑的。家庭裏，旅館裏，用着古老的荳油燈和洋燭來替代電燈。最倒　是那班住在高樓大厦裏的。因爲電梯停止使用的緣故，上下都得跑樓梯，跑得述氣都喘不過來。</p>
<p>現在，光明來臨了，仗着政府的努力，和美軍的協助，我們這兒的難關，終算已經獲得了相富的解次。當我們看到今日巴黎的情形時，我們又怎能不爲自己慶幸，而對那不幸的巴黎市民表示深摯的同情呢？</p>
<h3>東北小統計</h3>
<p>東北鋼鐵的產量每年的二百萬噸，這些鍊鋼廠，按美國標凖來看，相當小，但按遠東的標準來看，非常大，它們在協助亞洲工業化的過程中還可以擴大。</p>
<p>化學工業的出產，有工業化酒藉，化學肥料，水泥工業用　等，這些工廠主要原料豐富也可能擴大。</p>
<p>木材廠因東北木料取之不竭，生產大量木材足供中國重建房屋，工廠鐵路及其他爲現代化所需要。</p>
<p>礦塲出產大批煤炭，銅，鉛，鋅，與爲數不少的金。</p>
<p>機器廠能造出火車頭，車皮，裝配汽車，製汽油等機器。</p>
<p>汽油廠從泥板岩中煉汽油以及工對用的燃料油。</p>
<p>其他工廠，也都完整可用，能生產大批不同的貨品，其類別有從簡單的農具，人造橡皮車胎，直到紙，普拉斯蒂克（可塑料），菜油與漆。</p>
<p>因此，中國現在接收到了這筆大　產。它雖有四萬萬五千萬人口，而普遍陷於窮困，有了東北的工業與自然資源，很可以形成一個單一的大工業國。不過中國對於如何經營大實業經騐極少，它怎麼去利用，還得看以後的情形。（美新聞處）</p>
<p>人造假腿</p>
<p>美國軍曹麥金太亞，因戰時受傷，即截去一腿，分在海濱城裝配人造假腿。麥氏偕看護婦與軍中同志一同散步，其輕快之態，在本圖中彷彿是呼之欲出。</p>
<h3>外交三巨人　最近讜論集納</h3>
<p>貝爾納斯是美國的國務鄕，是已故羅斯福總統的親信，曾隨總統出席克里米亞會議，一九四五年四月二日辭去戰時動員及復原局職務，擬從此退休故鄕，但十天之後，羅斯福總統病逝，於是他又復飛返華府襄助杜魯門德統，一九四五年七月二日他被任爲國務卿，今年十月間曾在倫敦參與五國外長會議。這次又出席莫斯科三强外長會議，最近對於國際合作問題有重要的發揮：</p>
<p>貝爾納斯</p>
<p>天下應爲全體國家的家</p>
<p>「我們現在生存於一個世界，在這種原子時代，區域的孤立主義實比一國的孤立主義危險更大。</p>
<p>我們的世界如分成爲勢力範圍與特權區域，那末爲和平所必需的那種合作就不可想望。</p>
<p>一九四三年的莫斯科宣言所以重要就因爲指明了這一點。這些世界最大强岡所作聯合宣言曾保設爭取勝利與維持和平時所需要的互相合作。在我們爲建立國家社會與放棄立基於勢力範圍那種不可信任的國際關係制度所作努力中，它實在是個里程碑。</p>
<p>莫斯科四國宣言發表以後，繼之有頓巴敦橡樹會議，德　　會議，克里米亞會議，舊金山會議與波茨坦會議。而聯合國機構與倫敦外長會議也由於莫斯科宣言的精神建立起來。</p>
<p>我最近在關於倫敦外長會議的報告中曾鄭重指出，國際合作需有明敏的妥協。這原則並不要我們或其他任何興家忽視它和它近鄰的特殊關係，但的確需要所有睦鄰關係與世界性國際關係的有組織系統配合。</p>
<p>我們所力求建立的世界系統統必須遵循於國家主權平等的原則。</p>
<p>這原則並不是說所有國家的力量與權勢相等，因爲它的不能平等猶同各人的力量與權勢。但它的確意味着對大小國家的獨立性與主權應有同等的尊重。國家在法律之前，猶同個人，應一律平等。這原則正是我們泛美系統的奠基石，也應該是聯合國的奠基石。</p>
<p>如果我們要獲得持久和平，那末爲建立和平採行上項原則實爲必要。因爲持久和平不可分割。它不僅是少數大國或幾個大集團所關心的事情，而是全國人民關心的事情。</p>
<p>美國相信這一點，因此認爲國家不論大小，凡擔負作戰責任的都須參與共建和平的工作。</p>
<p>過去幾世紀中，若干强國曾以各種理由分割世界。但，它們終於失敗，而失敗中使歷史上留下了血的軌跡。現在世界各國都已成爲鄰家，要求分割自將更難成功。</p>
<p>今天，世界已必須抉擇。天下應爲全體國家的家，而不應是一國的天下。」</p>
<p>貝文政策</p>
<p>貝文有廣博的知識和偉大的懷抱，他較艾登更有魄力。伸的外交經騐和艾登有極大的不同，即使外交是外相一手包辦的，他的政策也不會和艾登的相同。</p>
<p>他不像面面周到的艾登</p>
<p>貝文絕對不會像面面周到的艾登。我相信他可能獲得極大成就，道不僅是因爲今日的外交政策大部由內閣共同決定。貝文是個民主意識堅强和經騐足而魄力大的人—他可能放開一切不顧陳舊的外交政策和去年十二月工黨大會通過的外交政策而自行其是。我們於檢討工黨對主要外交問題的態度時不應忽路一個最重要的事實，那就是貝文個人的觀點對它很有左右的力量。</p>
<p>舉一個例，波茨坦宜言中關於德國未來的次策就應和貝文平常表示的觀點放在一起看。我們不妨看看本年春間貝文在世界職工會大會各國職工代表宴會席上，工黨布勒克普爾大會和他在議院發表的外交演說。他在在說明了德國人民應認淸他們的責任並以全力賠償歐洲各國的損失。他並說明了使德國陷入大規模失業和人民掙扎於鐵餓綫上的經濟混亂境地是不常的。毫無疑義地，他確曾說明了德國應恢復民主和組織工會等自由。他的話並不是亂人視聽的幌子，他並未聲援那些企圖保持舊有社會秩序的反動份子。</p>
<p>貝文外交演說的關鍵在於它對國際關係富有情感，貝文自工人和平民無家無業處着眼看國際關係，他並不從强權政治和抽象的　情着眼。</p>
<p>貝文所說的話要算他在希勒克普爾說的最有意義的了，他說：「美國是個崇奉私人投資的國家。蘇聯已使它的國內經濟社會化。英國現在正站在兩者間，已有我們所需要的向社會化經濟邁進的機會。』威爾金遜氏在議院演說論及聯合國憲章時也有同樣的話，他說：「舊金山認爲我們是……間於兩大經濟制度極端中的國家。』她和貝文同樣地認爲英國負有在美蘇問斡旋的特殊任務，英國應促使美蘇台作無問。</p>
<p>莫洛托夫</p>
<p>莫洛托夫最近曾綜述國際國內重要情勢，足供人門了解蘇聯動向，一向爲人們所密切注意。際茲三强外畏會議舉行時間，各方特別關懷於蘇聯意態，莫氏最近演說當屬最重要參考文件之一，爲特選譯以前聯合社所作莫氏演說的報道如左：</p>
<p>蘇聯應該鞏固勝利中的合作</p>
<p>莫洛托夫說：「我們希望我們國家蒸蒸日上，有原子能，並有其他許多事物。時至今日，天大的秘密要由一　或幾國組成的小圈子來保守，決不可能。……」因此原子能的發現不應用作顯示國際政策的力的表演，也不容就此對愛好和平國家的將來大感滿意。</p>
<p>他說原子彈巨大的破壞力還沒有爲防患侵略或保護和平而使用，他演說中在提到原子能時始終沒有提到美國或其他國家。</p>
<p>莫氏要求職敗的軸心國家賠償而勿存報復心理，同時警吿國人而今的世界中帝國主義的根源並沒有消除。「聯聯應盡心盡力鞏固於勝利中得來的合作。」</p>
<p>莫氏建議戰勝的盟國對待戰敗的軸心國家不應一切按照自巴的感情，只應按照防止新侵略的需要。</p>
<p>說起來莫洛托夫是唯一談到原子力的蘇聯高級官員，他主張蘇聯必須積極注意工業，並訓練高級的技術人員「我們必須在工業與國民經濟各方面獲有現代世界技術的成就以及使蘇聯科學與技術發揮最大作用的條件。』</p>
<p>社論</p>
<h3>還軍於國還政於民</h3>
<p>中央社重慶電稱：國民大會代表昨於民族復興節發表對時局共同意見，大意謂當前國是之解決途徑，不外兩點，即還軍於國與還政於民。我們雖尙未得讀其意見書之全文，但即據此電傳要旨來看，巳經可以抵得洋洋萬言的政論而有餘。</p>
<p>軍隊應爲國家所編，政權原爲人民所有。民國　造，三十四年今已將臨除夕，而尙有待於還軍於國，還政於民，政府與國民實在已應自慚自責，豈能再容故事阻撓，多所猶豫？目前政府召集政治協商會議的呼聲很高，各黨派連共產黨在內的代表以及所謂社會賢達者流，也都羣集陪都，往還酬酢，喜氣洋溢，似乎中國政局大可樂觀。我們站在國民立塲，深願這光明氣象，不再像前幾次政府與共黨商談時的曇花一現，轉瞬又蓋上了烏雲，乃愈覺得國民大會代表諸君的意見確是値得靈視。無論政府也好，各黨派也好，如果沒有澈底覺悟，共同一致的向「還軍」「還政」這條大路走去，中國政局恐將始終不能走上民主法治的軌道。</p>
<p>馬歇爾特使蒞華，各方對於馬氏將如何促進中國內部之團結統一，寄以深切的期望；可是他竟謙遜未　，不是說對中國認識不多，即是說此來首在聆取各方意見。可見中國內政如何處理方最合理合法，實在不是頃刻可以答復，而我們事專仰賴於盟邦，寄望於外人，不如反求諸己之爲愈。其實，中國事情，中國老百姓最明白，也最公正。故解決中國的國是，說難固難，說容易也眞挺容易。只要各黨各派都能尊重老百姓的意見，聽憑老百姓的判斷，誰也不能欺騙誰，誰也不能嚇唬誰。臨時拉一幫人，寫幾封信，自命爲代表，自詡爲公意，或許可以騙騙洋大人，而未必能欺老百姓！老百姓在今天評論國家大事，自有其極簡單而合理的標凖。誰能把軍隊立刻還給國家，眞受國家最高統帥的指揮，不再與老百姓爲敵，做那不利於老百姓的勾當，誰就可得到老百姓的稱譽。誰能把政權早一天還給人民—眞正的主人，實行人民有權政府有能的憲政，而不再憑藉什麼黨派，阻礙國民大會的召集，誰就能得到老百姓的推戴。所以國民大會代表所提供的「還軍於國」與「還政於民」兩項解決國是的途徑，的確是大多數老百姓的共同意見。國民大會代表能够要言不繁的直說出來，眞不愧爲國民的代表。</p>
<p>目前大家所提心弔膽的，就是：中國是否會分裂，是否將演變而爲割臄偏安之局？就目前的國際環境看；美國旣公認蔣主席所領導之國民政府爲中國唯一合法之政府，繼續予以支持，且又認爲維持一個强大統一之中國爲世界和平之重要因素；蘇聯不但與美國有同感，且中蘇同盟友好條約於此更有明文規定；而英法等等其他盟邦，縱或有如赫爾利將軍所斥責的若干帝國主義殖民地官員企圖阻撓中國之統一，但其政府和有遠見的政治家也無不希望申國成爲一個强大統一的民主國。如此，中國只應統一而不容許再有分裂割據，乃是各大盟邦的共同願望。再就國內的情勢看：國民政府旣早有停止武裝衝突，召開協商會議，和平商談解決國是的主張，共產黨最近也幸已派了代表到達陪都，共他黨派更各自準備參加商議。如果大家具有誠意，誰也不會疑心其中還有人存心要玩武力割據的把戲。按理說，中國的統一不會成爲問題。然而誠如赫爾利將軍所說，「中國一日有武裝之政黨與獨立之軍隊存在，實使中國之政治團結爲不可能者」。故要希望中國眞能成爲一個統一的强大國家，必須首先做到一切軍隊歸還國家的起碼條件。否則儘管口頭說「休戰」，書面提出「休戰建議」，而事實上依然可以天天襲擊，處處打仗。我們只要一翻昨今的報紙，就可看到共軍進犯天津西北郊，共軍在良鄕騷擾，蘇北共軍砍壞郵政機構，定縣共軍索糧徵兵……諸如此類的刺目新聞，即此可知如不立刻辦到還軍於國，中國老百姓即一日不得安枕。何况政黨弄兵的結果，可以形成割據分裂，或甚而至於招致外侮，醞釀戰禍，重使中國陷於萬刧不復之境！</p>
<p>其次，大家所注目的：中國將如何造成一個民主國家？共實這也不難。在各國，民主政制的方式儘有不同，而民主政制的精神則並無二致。這精神沒有別的，就是一國的政制聽由這一國的人民自次。故中國的主權在於中國的老百姓。老百姓有選舉權，有罷免權，就可以選舉那個黨派，罷免那些人物。老百姓有創制權，有　次權，就可以創制那種法律，否決那些條規。老百姓這種政權，沒有任何人，也沒有任何黨，可以否認它或擁奪它，更沒有任何外國可以來左右它。我們縱然希望政治恊商會議可以給各黨各派一個虛懷礎商和衷共濟的機會，可是政府卻不便而亦不能賦予這個沒有法律根據不經人民選舉的什麼會議，另有一種特權，去代表我們國民解決一切國家大事。故中國不要走上民主軌道則已，如要有一個民主的中國，則惟一的正當途徑，祗能希望政府提早由「訓政」而進於「　」，而此由「訓政」進於「憲政」的步驟，亦即杜魯門總統所期望於國民政府的「修改訓政」。如何修改呢？如何進於憲政呢？除了依法如期召集國民大會，俾於明年五月五日可以得見國民大會在首都開會制定憲法，使全國上下一體遵行而外，實無其他捷徑。中國人往往貪圖便宜，好抄小路；其實民主政治乃是歐美幾百年來孕育成長的政治，並無便宜小路可走，我們要學氏主，要眞正成爲民主國家，只有笨做，認眞的笨做，不因任何理由而再延緩國民大會的召開，國家根本大法的制定，更不能因政治恊商會議的召集，而躭誤了國民大會如期開會制憲的凖備工作。至於政治協商會議之必須公開，讓我們老百姓知道他們討論些什麼，這更是天經地義，無待深論。必如此，政府纔可表示誠意還政於民。舍此而談其他，實在都是校節，只有治絲愈紊，並不能澄淸中國政局的。</p>
<h3>廣州　煉氣工廠　翦影　從接收到復工</h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者梁風</p>
<p>「廣州煉氣工廠」這個名稱，連廣州人也還是很生疏，這個工廠究竟是製造些什麼？煉些什麼氣？都未爲外界所知道。他們沒有想到取之不盡用之不竭的空氣，除了維持全宇宙內的生物之生存外，還有着很大的用途，空氣內所包含的炭氣與氧氣，原來都可以利用的，不過這個煉氣工廠，目前　製浩壓縮氧氣，這種氣氣的用途也實在不小，凡燒焊，礦塲，機器廠，潛水艇，醫院等都得採用，並且還可作其他化學原料，所以在建國時期中，它對國防或者經濟等建設，都有莫大的帮助。</p>
<p>記者爲明瞭該廠的組織與製造過程，特去專訪一次，原來它是在廣州淪陷以後敵人所設立的，原本呌「　戶帝國壓縮瓦斯株式會社廣東出張所」，到日本投降以後，經濟部於本年九月間派專員接收後，始改名爲「廣州煉氣工廠」。</p>
<p>該廠自伍朝卓先生接長，與吳耀　工程師兼工務課長主持以來。即將所有日人辭退。經過爾個多月的整理與籌備，於十二月九日正式復工，可說是我當局接收舉南各工廠中第一個復工的工廠。</p>
<p>走進廠房參觀，那裏規模並不大，一間長約三丈丁字形的房間。首先映入眼簾的，是屋邊一個容量八立方公尺的氧氣貯蓄塔，抬頭一看在右角上豎有一根白鐵管，那就是空氣的入口；走進裏間有兩個高約七八尺直徑一尺半的鋼製水塔，塔裏盛有氫氧化納液（哥士的液製劑），空氣由空中吸入，經過這兩個氣氣化納的水塔，吸收了二氧化炭氣體，空氣再流入　　機，將空氣壓縮，壓力達到了二百氣壓，再入乾燦器將空氣中水份吸政後，導入高壓氫氧化納簡內，再將空氣洗滌，後又經過一冷水缸，使入冷却後導入分離器機內，在常　而在高度壓縮下，把空氣壓縮分離，這樣經過六小時的液化，七十九分氣氣上昇排出，所剩廿一分氣氣下沉，遂入貯蓄塔內，等塔內容有六立方尺氧氣後，又將氣氣導入高壓機再次壓縮，壓力達一百五十氣壓，也即使成一百五十公斤純氧氣。最後又導入分水筒將恐有殘餘的氣氣分化後，乃分注入五立方公尺，六立方公尺，七立方公尺三種容量的鐵撙裏，這便是氧氣製成品。鐵　的形式，頗像個兩三百磅重的炸彈，氧氣的力量很大，倘從一個小的孔裏透出，你拿一根火柴，那當你還未挨近那小孔，火柴就已燃燒起來了。</p>
<p>現該廠氧氣，每天產量是九十立方公尺，因爲電力廠供電所限，日間無法開工，紙能在夜閒製造，故產量不多。以目前產量的成本，每大除空氣不用購買以外，其餘需氫氧化納十磅，淸機油五磅，石棉十磅，電力四五〇度，和技術工人三十名就够了。目前該廠因復員伊始，一時未能將其由分離　排出之　氣加以充分利用（　氣可製亞莫尼亞），如電力廠供電時閒延長的話，那末他們工廠的產量就可增加到足以供全市機關工廠的需要</p>
<p>據伍廠長說：這類氣氣工廠，在重　有一個，是資源委員會辦的，規模還沒有這裏大。此外，貴陽也有一個，是航空委員會辦的，產量沒有曉得。他還說：目前値得報吿的，除了本廠是經濟部接收各工廠第一個復工的工廠以外，我們從接收到復工，都沒有用過經濟部的任何費用，而且現在已有相當的盈餘哩。（十二，十六，廣州）。</p>

<h3>本市半年來之煤價</h3>
<p>— 雪鵬</p>
<p>煤大別爲有烟無烟兩種，無烟係供燃料之用，有烟則爲工廠輪舶甩作動力之需，目前市售無烟　，大多爲陽泉塊，焦作塊，陽泉屑，有烟煤以大山屑，大山塊爲多，淮南塊次之。</p>
<p>二十年九一八事變，東北淪陷，敵人即以刦奪撫順本溪湖之煤，大量向各地推銷，當時上海用煤，照煤炭業統計，每年用量須五百萬噸，但百分之八十爲敵煤，所以在此時期可稱爲敵煤傾銷時期，二十二年國營煤業，特組國煤救濟委員會，一面加緊各地煤礦開，採努力擴展航運，一面征收特稅，以謀抵制，大同大興開灤漢冶平長興等煤源源而來，在此一時期，可稱爲國煤抬頭時期，及至抗戰軍興，各路煤礦先後爲敵佔據，敵人對於煤炭又復組織石炭聯合會，嚴厲統制，太平洋戰起，外煤來源告絕，本市用煤全賴存貨維持，此一時期可稱爲煤業恐慌時期，迨敵寇降服，大地回春，工廠輪車紛紛復業，煤需用量與日俱增，但以運輸工具尙未充沛，交通亦未恢復原狀，加以開灤撫順本溪湖等處爲匪所擾，秩序未復，政府雖竭盡全力，向泰皇島等地輸運來滬，終以粥少僧多、僅敷公用，民需燃煤，尙難濟配，無烟煤到貨更少，是以邇來其他物價均在下降，惟獨煤炭仍盤旋未已，茲將半年來煤價上落列表如下：</p>

<p>照上表所列煤價，以八月十五至九月一日一段時間，跌風最烈，一部份原因固由於天日重光，一般人咸以此後煤運可以暢通，囤戶出籠，購客觀望，但最大原因，則爲敵寇將歷年統制搜括之存煤，乘政府接收工作步調不能一致之隙，乘機偷賣所致，現在政府對於燃料已設燃料委會統籌採銷，開灤煤礦正在積極開採，秦皇島航綫亦已暢通，東九省接收工作運日進行順利，撫順本溪湖煤自可繼續開採，接收敵煤亦經開放，此後來源有着，煤價或可逐漸平抑。</p>
<h3>煤荒未易解除　煤業復業未多</h3>
<p>〔本報特訊〕煤價近來漸見平定，然因底盤已高，仍屬貨缺價昂必需品之一，以廠家普通採用之烟煤屑而言，每噸仍在十萬元有餘，較之戰前之僅爲十元至十一二元者，其相差固不可以道里計，即以今夏之常站定於偽幣十餘萬至二十餘萬關口者，其上漲率終未見回復原狀，在此復興生產事菜之際，蓋仍爲一個値得焦慮之問題也，考本市在勝利以前，敵偽政府對於煤斤來源，本已有數月感覺十分困難，及天日重光，敵偽固已屈膝，而其來源之停滯，又延長一二月之久，及盟軍協助政府疏通，燃料委員會極力設法，始逐批自連雲港秦皇島等處，將其積存煤斤輪運來申，其數量累計聞在八萬噸左右，由燃料委員會配給公用事業及國營工廠之需，其中電力公司日需一千噸左右，國營工廠雖有一部份接收煤斤作爲底子，而煤斤究屬燃料品，消耗旣易，維持自屬不久，其向燃委會配到者，聞仍屬不敷應川，觀於接收紡織廠等開工率之低，燃料之缺乏，亦爲其主因之一，至於民營工業，則說來可慘，在敵偽時期，有所謂「大中聯」者，曾以敷衍政策，略有配給，而爲數旣薄，爲期又暫，除有特殊背景外，殆始終藉「私貨」以開工，而當時偽政府又數度舉行存煤之登記與調查，並取締囤積，在馬路上車運煤斤者，其嚴重性僅次於軍火，偽經濟保安隊且藉此百端敲詐，多方羅掘，本市存煤，蓋早已剝削殆盡，自勝利來臨，取締當然已經解除，而地頭不通，運輸工具不足，其由煤商自運來由者，零星不足以供統計，因之工廠用煤，除收括僅有之各處存底外，竟無善策，現開美國柴油將有大批運到，此貨本可代煤斤爲燃料，則煤荒之嚴重性常可减輕，然以煤斤本可自組有餘之我國，若仍須購用進口品之燃料，則未免太不經濟，查本市煤斤來源，向爲開灤淮南楊泉大同諸礦，目下開　已開工出貨，日可得四千噸左右，淮南已有一部份復工，其在戰前本可日出二千噸，據云不久即可全開，前者出貨雖較多，而運輸多阻，接濟不易，後者到貨較易，近月商家已有前去購運者，而貨少且身骨較次，至於山西楊泉大同二礦，一出白煤，一出烟煤，戰前本有大量出產，今則完全停頓，且彼處即有存煤，以政局多故，無法運申，現在本市煤斤之來源，蓋仍有待於當局之疏通也，自煤業巨子謝君自大後方歸來，巳在以自力更生之態度，疏通煤運，本月已有一批自淮南運到矣，本市煤業原有一千家以上，現在正式收歇者雖屬無多，而開門無貨者比比皆是，以其著者而言，華北煤業公司本爲總銷華北諸礦之魁百，自敵軍進佔前租界，即收歇停業，至今其職員多以薄粥度日，元泰亦同時停業，迄今均未有復業消息，大昌與義泰興聞前與大中聯有關，因此亦米復業，次之如湧成·正大·民生·晉昌等第二流煤行，雖已重上市塲，亦因貨無把握，價無定程，未有生氣，本市原爲工業重心，吾人將來可就煤業之盛衰，以覘工廠復工之程度也。</p>

<p>美國學童扮演五十個聯合國代表　參加模倣性世界和平會議</p>
<p>新的國際認識</p>
<p>新的社會研究</p>
<p>新的公民訓練</p>
<p>美國舊金山羅斯福高等學校規定：十餘歲學童參加「模倣性世界和平會議」，作爲現代化民主國的學生們社會研究功課之一部分，由於最近之事實，引起了他們的興趣。因爲一九四五年春天，國際組織之聯合國會議，即在舊金山開會，使此輩學童對於國際間題發生濃重興趣。他們自組「模倣性世界和平會議」，由五十個學童扮演五十個聯合國代表，這對於他們成爲公民後將來活動，實具有極寶貴的意義。（附圖三幅）第一圖：（模倣性世界和平會議開會時，一個女「代表」在黑板上提出當天的議題，交付「代表」五十個聯合國的學童，共同討論。第二圖：一個學童，在這模倣的世界和平會議中，扮演「英國代表」，座前　有被戰爭毀滅的城市小模型一具，其旁則爲重建後的房屋模型，他　述意見，表示戰後建設，實爲迫切需要。這頗引起「中國代表」的注意。第三圖：扮演五十個聯合國「代表」的學童，在開會時，靜心聆聽各國「代表」的建議及反建議，會塲（敎室）牆壁上揭示着故美國總統羅斯福　語：「吾人設欲文明永恆綿延，則必須培　人類關係的科學，和各種族全體人類的能力，共同生活，共同工作。」</p>

<h3>錢市長昨晚廣播　新生活的意義</h3>
<p>上海市錢市長大鈞，於昨（廿五）日下午六時半，向全市市民廣播。題爲「新生活運動的意義」，原詞略謂：上海市政府爲了要奉行蔣主席實行新生活的訓示，特　照中央的規定，聯合本市黨政軍各機關和社會人士共同組織了一個「新生活運動促進會」，由本人担任主任幹事，預備要在上海這個地方切實的和普遍的推行新生活運動，現在這一個運動，開始展開，因此本人今天特地向本市各界同胞播講，說明新生活運動的意義以引起大家的注意。</p>
<p>轉移風氣</p>
<p>新生活運動就是一種「轉移風氣」的運動，在我到上海來的三個多月期中，我曾經幾次三番說到轉移風氣的重要，我曾經舉出建設的兩大類，說明精神建設的重要超過物質建設，所謂精神建設，其意義與所謂轉移風氣並沒有多大區別。</p>
<p>現在要問我們是處在怎樣一個時代，需要怎樣一種風氣，才能適合呢？大家都知道，我們現在是處在一個偉大的建國的時代，我們環顧世界，可以看出我們今日在許多方而都不如人，不論經濟·軍事·政治，以及科學敎育方面，都比人家差得很遠。我們必須切實努力，才能迎頭趕上，這種認識，當然不自今日起，現在我們全國業已統一，强敵業已打倒，而且盟國間的友誼，日見增進，國際上的合作，日見成長，這種局面，正是我們努力建國的黃金時代，以我們目標之偉大，範圍之廣泛，工作的艱鉅，自然是顯而易見的。我們要完成任務，就必須要有一種適應這種要求的良好風氣，如果全國人民的思想行爲，生活習慣，都能適應逍種要求，那麼我們建國的完成一定是事半功倍。</p>
<p>掃除病態</p>
<p>指出國民應當遵循的新途徑，這條新的途徑，就是「提倡體義廉恥的規律生活，以禮議廉恥之素行習之於日常生活——衣食住行四事之中。」因此，蔣主席訓示我們要「明禮義，知廉恥，負責任，守紀律。」對於我們一般生活，並指示六大原則，就是「整齊，淸潔、簡單，樸素，迅速，確實。」同時要求生活上要做到三「化」，就是「軍事化」，「生產化」，「合理化」。這是新生活運動幾點最重要的原則。希望全國國民都能記住，都能省察，都能實行。如果全國國民都能做到，我認爲我們現在在上海最先要推行四種運動。</p>
<p>四種運動</p>
<p>第一：是厲行清潔衛生　上海現在實在不够淸潔，不但於衛生有碍，而且於觀瞻有碍。我們已經舉行過一次淸潔運動週，現在又在舉行大掃除。我們必須繼續努力。</p>
<p>第二：是，遵守規矩秩序，　上海市民衆多，交通擁擠，尤其自明年一月一日起，率馬要改靠右行駛。對於交通規則，要特別注意。同時還委求全市市民遵守秩序，無論是在車站上車，或者在戲院購票，以及其他公共塲所，都要按照次序，不可爭先恐後。</p>
<p>第三：是提倡簡單樸素，　上海是一個商塲，市民　於奢糜繁複，這種習俗，不但易流邪僻，而且是廠糜物力。我們今後應當力矯頒風，提倡簡單樸素，衣食住行，都要節約，所有婚喪喜慶，應酬餽贈，都要遵守簡單樸素的原則。建國時期，尤其要節省物力，以充建設之需。</p>
<p>第四：是提倡正當娛樂，　上海市過去很多市民的生活，實在過於糜爛腐化，以致烟賭　風行全市，大家趨之若驚，削弱人民體格，造成民族頺風。我們除了對於這些不良娛樂，嚴加取締，還要提倡正當娛樂，以爲代替。例如從事體育遊憇公園閱豐圖書，都是有益身心的正當娛樂。我們要力爲市民設法，增加設備和便利。同時要求全市市民，摒除惡習染，養成新習慣，踴躍參加，和從事這種正當娛樂。</p>
<p>以上不過是新生活運動中所要推動的工作的一部份，我們預備儀先推動，然後再及其餘。我所希望大家注意的，第一就是認識新生活運動的重要性，第二，就是要知道新生活運動乃是一種社會遝動，實行和宣傳的任務，還需要全市市民的自覺與自動。同時還要廣勸親友實行，互相策勵，互相督促，如此一人傳十，十人傳百，新生活運動才能在上海切實地普遍地推動起來。造成新上海的條件雖多，但是主要的條件，乃是上海市民能够實行新生活，新生活的實行乃是新中國的建造之必要基礎，也是新中國的成功之可靠的保證，希望全體市民切實實行，努力勸導，以完成這個重要的使命。</p>
<h3>地院首次判決　黃牛黨遭拘禁</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕以擾亂火車乘客購票秩序稱著之飛票黃牛黨，在勝利前曾猖獗一時，正常旅客頭受其累。自交通部接收「華中鐵道公司」後，對取締黃牛黨不遺餘力。本年十月間，鐵逍警務處成立，即開始大捕黃牛黨，曾派出便衣警探多名，佯裝旅客，乘機兜捕。業於上月上旬，將一部份黨徒王小林·高洪泉·李龍文·陳財源等十四人（內有女性四人）相繼拘獲，送解地方法院。經詢問後，於昨日上午十時宜判，車票沒收，拘禁日期自廿五天至五十天不等，並不得交保。按此次爲本市第一次黃牛黨之判決，聞北站鐵道警務處續有黃牛黨多名覊押，尙未解院。</p>
<h3>規定外僑懸旗辦法　中外國旗同時懸掛</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於懸掛外國國旗定例，市政府刻已接奉外交部咨文，茲已轉知各國駐滬領事知照，茲誌其辦法如次：</p>
<p>按國際通例，各外國政府機關可每日懸掛其本國國旗，惟外國居民，商店及普通機關，則僅淮於該國國慶日或其他紀念日懸掛國旗，以示慶祝。並須同時懸掛所居留國之國旗。</p>
<p>如兩國國旗成對角而懸時，則中國國旗應懸於右方，如兩國國旗上下而懸，則中國國旗應懸於上方。</p>
<p>又依國際通例，今本市各租界均已收回，外僑皆享有本市政府保護之權。故必將中國國旗與其本國國旗同時懸掛。</p>

<p>同泰昌被盜羽黨全落網</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕上月卅日下午九時三十分，北站分局巡官高善儉，率同警士及便衣搜查隊，在北浙江路海寗路口，見有行色倉皇之任傳如一名，身携包袱一大包，乃帶局盤詰，據供係自車站旅客竊來，但檢視包袱內衣服零亂，故斷定決非竊得。正偵訊時，適有華興路一一四號同泰昌烟紙店主郭君生來局報告被盜，遂令其細察包裹，確係適所被刧之物，乃嚴加盤詰，任知無可抵賴，當供出餘黨張立生。姜正超等共同行刧不諱，據供按址陸續捕獲羽黨。此案業已全部偵訊完畢，於昨日解送淞滬警備總司令部依法懲辦。</p>
<h3>外商次油公司器材　已尋獲一部份　加油站四十所正恢復中</h3>
<p>美孚·德士古·亞細亞·等火油公司，所有儲油庫，小型油池，帮浦及其他器材，戰時均這日方拆除藏匿，或予被壞，損失重大。其中以亞細亞損失最重，德士古損失較小。現除各公司儲油庫尙可應用外，其他帮浦及小型油池等器材，曾由日方藏匿，經我常局代爲多方尋覓後，已發現一部份，並發還各該公司重新裝置應用。其餘則仍賡續留存倉庫中，其中一部份或則已被破壞失散，不堪再用矣。</p>
<p>小型油池</p>
<p>爲適應滬市正常需要，美孚等三公司，正努力於原有各處之加油站，重新裝置五百至一千加侖之小型油池，及新式自動計算帮浦，供應汽油·火油及機油。各該公司恢復之加油站，全市現有四十站左右，以德士古恢復最早，數量亦較多。各項油類均來自美國德士古州等地，爲美孚·德士古·兩家所有。亞細亞在滬供應之貨，係借自以上兩家，且派有中美籍人員各一名，在亞細亞協助工作。</p>
<p>加油　浦</p>
<p>現市上所有加油站帮浦並非最新式者，而數量甚少，不敷應用，且無法供未來大量需要。美孚·德士古·有鑒及此，特向美國訂購多量帮浦，及其他器材來華，以應需要，該項器村，約於明春一二月即可到達，而與多量之各項油類俱來，定可預卜。加時液體燃料之供應市面，將益屆充沛。</p>

<h3>救濟失業工人　下月起發放麵粉　成年工人每月一袋半童工一袋</h3>
<p>社會部上海市失業工人臨時救濟委員會，辦理本市失業工人救濟以來，截至本月十五日止，申請救濟者，計共四〇四工廠，失業工人一〇五，四六九名。其中除經核與規定辦法不符，不予救濟之五一工廠，八、五六四人，及正在審核中之二四工廠，四、八七一人外，業已獲得救濟者共三二九工廠，九二、〇三四人，按本市失業工人之救濟，原以三個月爲限，現限期已屆，而工廠復工者，爲數尙屬有限，當經該會第十二次會議決定，申請救濟登記應即公告截止，所有登記有案之失業工人，除已復工者外，決予繼續救濟三個月，其救濟辦法，業經該會與行政院善後救濟總署上海分署商定，撥發麵粉，以資救濟，並決定自三十五年一月份起，開始發放。至發放日期，另行分別通知。</p>
<p>其發放麵粉數量，規定如下：</p>
<p>發放辦法業經規定</p>
<p>（一）成年工人每人每月發給六十六市斤（一袋半），（二）童工每人每月發給四十四市斤（一袋），成年工人每二十日發給一袋，童工每月發給一袋，槪以三個月爲限。（二）發放麵粉地點爲：（一）滬東區1滙山路四區捲烟工會華成分會。2虹口吉林路口上海機器洗染廠。（二）滬西區1澳門路小沙渡路工運指導分會。2澳門路小沙渡路水月小學。（三）滬南區蓬萊路清節堂市總工會。（四）滬北區武昌路乍浦路勞動協會。（五）浦東區東昌路五區黨部。（三）發給領粉證及領取麵粉時，以每一工廠爲單位，用連保辦法，定十人爲一組，相互保證，如發現有已復工或冒領情事者，即停發該組全部之麵粉，以資懲戒。</p>
<p>麵粉平賣將再抑低</p>
<p>第二期平價麵粉，定二十八日發售，救濟總署正委託阜豐·福新兩麵粉公司聯合辦事處登記中，此次出售數量，己見大增，最多可購五十包，切麵店·大餅饅首攤，本期起亦可參加購買。此項平粉，聞前往登記購買者，非常踴躍，數量之多，出於意料之外，由於此項平粉之出售，已影響普通市價，趨於低落。據救濟濟總署發言人稱：購買者不免間有企圖囤積之輩，爲澈底消除此種企圖計，除將繼續不斷發售外，對售價亦將逐步壓低，使企圖囤樻者，無利可圖，又如發現此種情事，該署將取消其下期購買之權。</p>

<h3>錢市長親臨證婚　四十二對新人　締結勝利良緣</h3>
<p>— 本報記者惺吾</p>
<p>上海市社會局主辦之勝利紀念集團結婚典禮，昨晨十時，在中正中路浦東大廈舉行。到來賓二千餘人，錢市長親臨證婚，儀式簡單，莊嚴隆重。參加結婚者共四十二對。行禮時由社會局代理局長葛克信（何惕庵代），宣讀證書。錢市長分別發給結婚證書，並各贈將委員長著「中國之命運」一册，以留紀念。除錢市長即席致證婚詞外，來賓袁希洛·丁福保等，均有精闢演說，至十一時三十分　成。</p>
<p>紅燭高燒</p>
<p>社會局的　員差不多出動了大半，都佩上幹事·糾儀·等類的紅緞　，忙忙碌碌的佈置和指揮。禮堂中央舖了紅的一條地毯，到門的　頭左右分成二條。　　上　　大菜　、高　着紅燭，二排來賓席和家屬席，都擠得滿滿的。時間差不多了，四十二對新郞新娘已忙了半天的穿戴和化裝，一切都已準備完畢。</p>
<p>喜氣洋溢</p>
<p>十時一刻，婚禮開始，藍　黑褂的新郎，白　服粉紅色兜紗的新娘，喜氣洋溢，排成二行。在結婚進行曲中緩緩入塲，綿長而整齊，不由得全塲的目光都集中到她們和他們身上。撤花提燈的四位小先鋒，活潑可愛，尤其引起全塲的注意。</p>
<p>市長證婚</p>
<p>證婚人錢市長來得很早，當司儀喊過證婚人入廣，他就穩步登臺，宣讀過結婚證書。行過三鞠躬的結婚禮，便致詞道：結婚不但是人生一件大事，而且也是國家社會一件大事。我人應重視婚禮，却幷不一定要把婚禮弄成繁瑣舖張。舉行婚禮，固然要做到莊嚴肅穆，可是儀式要簡單，用費要節省。集團結婚的制度，正能適合這種要求，實在有提倡搖行的必要。從逍個時候起、各位每一對新人，從前是兩個不相關的個體，現在便成爲一個分不開的家庭了。以互助心和責任感，分別去建立各個美滿的家庭，更共同來建設一個繁榮的上海，一個强盛的中國。」</p>
<p>兩老演說</p>
<p>繼由來資袁希洛·丁福保·二位老先生致賀詞，袁老先生妙語解頤以美。英。蘇。法。四字來恭賀新夫締。丁老先生以一口無錫土白，講解健身之道，博得全塲掌聲。演講完畢後，發給結婚證書，一對又一對，差不多運續到半個鐘頭，累得二十個榮隊滿頭大汗。</p>
<p>連續鞠躬</p>
<p>錢市長還了四十二次鞠躬禮，立了一個多鐘頭，可是仍舊英氣勃勃的站着，畢挺的新洋裝，新剃的平頂頭，在霓虹喜字的紅光下，顯得格外年靑了。錢市長對每對新夫婦還送了一本「中國之命運」，婚禮直到十二點才完畢。</p>
<p>省無可省</p>
<p>社會局這次是第一次舉辦集團集婚，以後還要繼續的辦下去。爲力求簡省，所以不備茶點。每對新人祗收費三千五百元，包括一切禮堂。照相·鮮花·等項。所以聽得有人說，結次婚祗要一雙襪子的錢呢。據說，社會局却貼了十多萬元。</p>
<p>一個統計</p>
<p>八十四位新人，社會局曾做了籍貫和年齡的統計，茲抄錄如下：本市十一人，江蘇省三十九人，浙江省二十六人，廣東省六人，其他二人。年齡十七至二十歲十八人，二十一至二十五歲三十七人，二十六至三十嵗二十一人，三十一至三十五歲六人，三十六至三十九歲二人。</p>

<h3>鄕土的戀</h3>
<p>— 墨羽</p>
<p>今夜鄜州月，</p>
<p>閨中祗獨看；</p>
<p>遙憐小兒女，</p>
<p>未解憶長安。</p>
<p>香霧雲　濕，</p>
<p>淸輝玉臂寒；</p>
<p>何時倚虛幌？</p>
<p>雙照淚痕乾！</p>
<p>杜甫</p>
<p>秋夜長空寂靜而又肅殺，凄厲的凉風帶着遼遠的夢幻，從簷角下輕輕地刷過來。抬起沉重的頭悵惘地向窗外探望，午夜的圓月正高高地嵌在藍色的天幕上，彷彿一張貧血人的臉孔，露着一副可怕的慘曰的顏色，面着疲憊的旅人憂　地苦笑。</p>
<p>是過度的疲憊使旅人邂逅在這樣的一個陌生的寂聊的院落裏，孤獨咬嚙着我的心，胸口便感到有一陣什麼壓迫。呵，田園的毁滅，家人的流離，這一幅血淚和殘酷勾織的圖畫，把我的遐想拉得深長而又遼遠，抖一抖，破碎的心靈，鎖着沉重的眸子，吟起唐代詩人杜甫的這一首詩，我不禁懷　起那一片親切熟請的土地來。</p>
<p>砲火的洗禮，魔鬼帮兇們的一陣吆喝，再一把毒火，毀滅了我的故園。帶着憎恨和懷念，踏上流亡的路，在風沙里顚沛，過去的千百個日子，常圓月在高空掛起的時候，我總會吟讀起杜甫的詩句，一遍，十遍，二十遍，……這寥寥的幾行字句，悄悄地將悵惘和抑鬱在我的心靈上　上一層濃厚的黑銹。</p>
<p>現在，千百個日子了，一串懷想曲使我的記憶深刻，陰影和絕望爬上了心頭，我到現在還沒有能够去重建田園！</p>
<p>經過長期的流亡顚沛，當勝利的消息傳遍每一角落時，誰都感到難言的喜慰，從陰霾的沉淵中掙扎出來，從驚濤駭浪里拯救出來，愉快的心境和表情幾乎要使人瘋狂！因爲道一下不再是流離和愁苦了，換來的該是重逢時的興奪的熟淚，甚至擁抱！隨着凱旋的歌聲，多少男女們踏上了他們的歸途，去重溫舊日的好夢。可是，現在，我還沒能作歸去準備，我沒有堅靱的鞋底去踏那塗上血淚的灰土的荆棘，破碎了的田園上的瓦礫。我也不願在魔鬼的爪牙帮兇們沒有死亡以前就先自向故國移近一步！……何况那一片草原上還正繼續搬演着蟲蝕的故事呢！……</p>
<p>這麼着，讓記憶的火燃燒吧，讓遐思從抑鬱里解脫，向遠天的人們致虔誠的默禱和祝福。當着深藍的夜空，在凄白的月光下，我反覆念誦着杜甫的詩句，雖然我沒有這位老詩人當年在長安時的細緻的幻覺，希望有一天能够「倚虛幌」，在月下「雙照淚痕乾」，但我的悲憤却超過他的想像的意境，尤其覺得「等是有家歸未得，勝利猶作浪遊人」這兩句話，對於我簡直是一種熱辣的諷刺！</p>
<p>今夜，我的眼眶有點潤濕了，我的心跳動的很厲害，一縷辛酸侵入我的情緒里，想起在那一片熟悉的土地上，千萬人們爲毒蝎吮吸着血液，千萬隻眼角邊還掛着淚痕，翹首雲天，我第一次爲着家的毀減和鄕土的荒涼而流淚！</p>
<p>長夜過去便是黎明，一陣急雨之後決不會再有陰霾出現，有着希望的人痛苦是暫時的。但什麼時候可以肅淸全部的毒滓呢？什麼時候可以讓流浪人投入故園的懷抱，獲得一個喘息的機會呢？我仰望着繁星和蒼天。</p>
<p>我相信他們的末日必然會來到，今夜我憤然撕碎杜甫的詩，把白紙片代替長劍向夜空投擲，並爲遠天的人們喊出勇敢地活下去的呼嘯！</p>
<h3>思想漫談</h3>
<p>— 陸丹林</p>
<p>在一個極度前進和極度守舊的社會思想中，便有人想到中庸之道來了。有人以爲「中庸」是圓滑，模稜兩可，沒有是非的代名詞，那是錯誤的。試以圓形來說，中心只有一點。這一點，就是中，絕沒有一些伸縮性。雖然宇宙是進化不息，最適之中，是跟着時間空間而異。但是，他無論怎樣，在剎那間，都有他的一個「鵠的」的。</p>
<p>有些不澈底的人，做一椿事，只做了十分之五，便算了事。什麼「適可而止」，「不爲已甚」，和與其「畫虎不成反類犬」，不如「刻鵠不成還類驚」。他們估量如此，是雙方討好，豆腐刀，兩面光；水晶球，面面俱圓。其實呢，這是拖泥帶水，不澈底的表現。「不求有功，只求無過」，這是不敢有所爲的庸碌行爲。一部分的人，中了逍些毒害，迷焉罔覺，便養成了缺乏創造冒險的精神，埋沒獨往獨來的進取心志了。</p>
<p>曲解中庸的人，以爲做事不要過於澈底，澈底便不是中庸，而且還有些是違背儒家的學說，這也是誤人不淺的。孔仲尼最憎恨的是鄕愿，他說：「鄉愿，德之賊也』。鄉愿的典型，是怎樣的呢？孟子與曾代解答：「非之無舉也，刺之無刺也。同乎流俗，合乎汚世。居之似忠信，行之似廉潔，衆皆悅之，自以爲是，而不可與入堯舜之這。故曰：德之賊也」。當時的所爲鄕愿，和目下所說「好人」，或是「老好人」，有點相像。馮友關說這些人，旣不敢爲大惡，亦不能行大善。不敢爲大惡，所以「居之似忠佰，行之似廉潔」。不能行大善，所以「同乎流俗，合乎汚世」。遇事人云亦云，模棱兩可，所以「衆皆悅之」。惟其衆皆悅之，所以大家都呌他們是「好人」，或「老好人」。這種人，正是儒家所稱爲「德之賊也」。尙論人世，摘奸發伏，眞是一鍼見血的話。</p>
<p>然則什麼纔是眞正的中庸之道呢，太過與不及，都有偏頗。比如走路，不能失之過左，也不能失之過右，否則，便不是當中，容易走人歧途岔路。</p>
<p>亞里士多德，雖是柏拉圖的大弟子，但是亞與柏的學說截然雨樣。柏的學說，是基於主觀的理念；亞呢，却以客觀的事實做據點。其原因，亞出世比柏差不多遲了半世紀，亞所處的時代，已蛟柏進步。社會人事的關係越加複雜，那他研究的資料，越加豐富，研究對象，越加寬闊，這是古今中外的共通性。所以後人們對於柏亞二人約定論，柏是西洋文化史上哲學的始祖，亞是西洋文化史上科學的先驅。亞雖從學於柏，絕不是亦步亦趨一成不易的守成者，他却是一個繼往開來的先鋒，而不是盡守成規的保守者。故亞曾公開的表示說：「我愛我的老師，我更愛眞理。」看亞的這兩句話，知道亞不是一個保守派，而是一個創造家。因此，我們也該認楚我們的時代與環境，而做一個適應時代與環境所需要的人，不要沾沾目喜跼處一隅只做一個保守者，遭受時代與環境的自然遺棄。</p>
<p>康有爲早年的思想銳敏，很有作爲，熱忱地從事維新變法還動，在戊戌政變的前後，可說維新人物，可是過了不久，他不能切實的把握時代，反而給時代與環境所淘汰了，卒之，和張　們挾擁溥儀小醜復辟，完了他一生的回光反照的一幕醜劇，只博得老朽頑固約定論，以終其身，孫中山先生却不然，他認淸楚自己的責任，一生事業，無論勝敗利鈍，絕沒有一些悲觀畏縮，宗旨如一，奮鬥不懈。這種勇往邁前，精誠救國的大無畏精神，崇高偉大的人格，一直到病歿北平，依然是先知先覺的時代前面的領導人。所以分析與歸納起來，康有爲是一個失敗者，孫中山先生是一個成功者，釐毫差別，便成千里之隔了。</p>
<p>「得過且過」的態度與「滿不在乎」的心理，都是玩世不恭，放浪隨便的人們所有。他們抱持着一首古詩所說：『人乞祭餘驕妻妾，士甘焚死不公　；賢愚千載知誰是，滿眼蓬蒿共一丘。』把不言祿的介之推，和孟子輿所引說的無恥「齊人」，相提並論，以作「善惡問夢，智愚一丘」的解釋。所謂『堯舜一枯骨也，桀紂一枯骨也。』人生幾十年，論富貴榮華，壽夭窮通，一旦呼吸斷絕，便成腐屍。所以對着什麼事，都是馬馬虎虎，鬆懈緩弛，不認眞，不起勁，「遇飲酒時須飲酒，得高歌處且高歌」，人生行樂耳，天跌下，當棉被蓋，管他什麼。（最顯著的，如某俳句，「搓搓麻將，國家事，管他娘。」就是一例。）這種人，漢視了自己的責任，喫飽飲醉，對於國事，只有諷刺與慢馬，而沒有貢獻；只有淸談，而缺乏具體的建議。國家與社會在安定的時候，那就謬論滔滔，好像治國平天下的大道理，都在他的滿腹經綸計劃中。但是，事變忽來，則他的胸中實無一策，手足無措地怨天尤人。其甚的，也不過藉着泯棼之會，渾水摸魚，來達到他的利祿目的而已。</p>
<p>歷史上有些是獎勵隱士的，所謂「賢者避世，其次　地……」就是最好的例子。其實這些是國家民族的贅疣，行尸走肉的表現罷了。在大時代的轉輪不歇地推進中，怎能够容許這種自私自利茍安的人存在，天然淘汰，是必然的，只有時候的　　而區分。</p>
<p>如果人人能够抱着「當今之世，舍我其誰」，不肯卸責推諉的心志，那就國家社會上的一切事業都有辦法，又豈獨抗戰已勝，而建國當然也必成的了。</p>
<p>有些人以爲處在白雲蒼狗，變幻無常的社會裏，總是脫不了入主出奴，是丹非素的成見，人世間沒有什麼眞的是非。他們耳聞目擊着那些僥倖的暴發戶與暫時稍可彌縫的貪汚脚色：起居飲食，肆意揮霍，服用奢華，氣使意指；而和其他潛心學術，埋頭著作，或是終日在辦公室裏案牘勞形的苦幹，或者沐雨櫛風手胼足胝的工作，所得的報酬，所享受的衣食住行育樂和瞻養家庭生活，判若天淵；便遽然來下判斷，以爲宇宙間缺乏眞的是非，沒有善惡。一個人在生活惡劣，精神苦悶，環境壓迫的時候，不免容易撩起有此憤恨怨懟。但是，要是我們退一步的想，或是眼光放遠一點來看，那就這些僥倖或貪污的人物，等於曇花一現，悖入悖出，沒有方法延續長久的。而且他們鈎心鬥角的作僞心勞日絀的精神痛苦，絕不能和「知足常樂」的人們同日而語。耶穌曾說到自己的生活：「狐狸是有穴，飛鳥也有巢，可是人子却沒有枕頭的處所。」顏　在陋巷，一　食，一瓢飲，曲肱而枕，樂亦在其中。安貧樂道，　是自樂其樂。迷醉奢華，不特是慢性自殺，實在等於飲酖解渴。生錢納利頂門風」，是浪子妖娃的行爲，稍有點自尊自愛自重自立的人，都不屑去幹。尤其是在國家多難之秋，建國還沒有完成的時候，更該自動的　成節約儉樸的風尚和習慣。俗語說得好：「吃得苦中苦，方爲人上人。」汪信民也有說：「人常咬得菜根，則百事可做。」人生雖然絕對的不是以吃苦爲貴，但是，爲了時代與環境生活，不能够甘於淡泊的人，他必不能够懷抱堅貞，容易給那物慾引誘而變動意志。一般喪名敗節的人們，必定是那些嗜慾深沈的腐（惡）化份子。不信，可以把戰前各地偽組織的沒有脊柱動物蛆轟檢討一下，就是一個實證</p>
<p>做事應該有決斷果敢的精神，不該存着模稜兩可的游移態度。黃遠庸曾經指出國人的公毒，是「籠統」。什麼事多是含混而不徹底正確。是的，如從前機關裏的公文句子，「事出有因，查無實據」，已經傳爲公牘的笑柄了。而有些人談話，什麼「好像」，「也許」，「似乎」，「大致」，「或者」，『不無」，「容許」等一套不負責的空洞話，表示自己是懂得談話藝術，不會給對方拿着他的中心點的技巧。這種八面玲瓏的油腔滑調，實在影響社會人心，至重且大。在現在事事要購科學化的切合實際性，這些空洞沒有肯定，活搖活動，東倒也可，西倒也可，缺乏果斷的話頭，我們應該怎樣的把他徹底掃除呢。最低限度，自己對人講話，要負責任，忠實而明朗點。否則，閃爍其辭，言不由衷，是耶非耶；與君一夕話，對方等於霧裏看花，怎能够觀察得出一些眞實事象。</p>
<p>賈誼的鵬烏賦：「天地爲鐵兮，造化爲工；陰陽爲炭兮，萬物爲銅。」有人把他來比社會是　，社會（國家）的領袖們是工，他們的行爲是炭，而一般羣衆是鋼。個人投身入社會，大槪都給社會所溶化。這種解釋，異常貼切。我們知道社會（國家）的領袖，領導他們的羣衆，他們的羣衆，擁護他們的領袖。這樣互相激勵密切關聯，便能產出一種內力充實的行動，這種行動，是不可容易動搖的呀。</p>
<h3>久客渝州有感</h3>
<p>— 陳三壽</p>
<p>無端作客幾經春，昔日豪情盡化塵，久病怕聞蟬脫噪，長閑更憶海潮音；大河繞郭知魚美，稚子依人覺愛眞，東望家園何處是？白雲飄渺動歸心！</p>

<h3>黑暗裏的明燈</h3>
<p>— 吳仭之</p>
<p>在上海，有不少條柏油馬路，看上去都是平坦而且十分光滑的樣子。可是，其實，不過是看上去如此而已。</p>
<p>當你在下雨天走過這些馬路，泥水濺到了你的身上，或是你的脚下踏着了幾個小水窪，那時候你便會覺得了，原來這些馬路上還有許多的凹凸。</p>
<p>這些馬路上的凹凸，在暗地裏固然看不見，在白天却也不見得顯然。祇有在黑夜裏，汽車頭裏的兩盞燈，明晃晃地迎面照着開過來，這時候會使你立刻看到，原來這些很平坦而且十分光滑的柏油馬路上到處都是凹凸。</p>
<p>於是我恍然大悟。人，不逢困難遭遇是不會覺得世途的不平。</p>
<p>而這世途不平的所在，在黑暗裏固然不能使你看得淸楚，在所謂的天亮之後，却也未必能使你辦得分明。祇有在黑暗裏的明燈之下，才會使你明察秋毫。</p>
<p>不是麼？黑暗裏的明燈方是眞正的光明。到了所謂的光天化日之下，也許就成了粉飾太平的明光了。</p>
<h3>戰士，你幾時歸來？</h3>
<p>— 陳淦閣</p>
<p>戰士：我們自一九四一年九月在靑島分別後，四年來，我始終生活在血和淚的環境中，正如你在大洋中倚在十四吋口徑的大砲的憲擊中一樣。期間我有着無限的話想對你申訴，結果，却沒法足以克服環境，直到現在，我還在受他支配着。所以，我祗有等待，等待你和你同伴的凱旋歸來！可是，你的同伴，如今已衣錦榮歸了，受着人家的歡迎和愛慕，而你呢？</p>
<p>你臨別留下了六十元美鈔，同時也留下了老母，二弟一妹和我母子五人；在漫長的日子中，我們須要生活。我們在最困苦的當兒，從一日三餐减爲二餐，再縮爲一餐。從雪白的米飯改爲薄粥，而山芋，而珍珠米粉；有時候竟效伯夷叔齊而挨着餓。當時，在萬分困苦中，仍不敢申訴，也不敢咒駡。我堅信你有一天會歸來，恢復我們原有的生活的。於是，在無可如何之下，將你遺下的傢具，一件一件地變賣了，爲了活命！</p>
<p>是這麼的一天，一九四三年二月九日，整個南京路遭逢了日軍的封鎖，一日，二日……我們餓着，餓着，在第三日的清晨，終於受不了俄火的打擊了，於是，你的愛兒明，冒着險，企圖偷出這個死圈，我，憑窗下望，心中同他一樣冒着餓火，邊祝福着他的越園成功。</p>
<p>他跨出了大門，剛想跨越鐵絲網，「拍！拍！拍！」眼望着他倒了下去。我彷彿驚呌了一聲，便暈了過去。</p>
<p>等我醒來，面前已立着二個日兵和一個通譯，强調說明兒犯罪被擊，已送入了當地的海軍醫院了。</p>
<p>如是七星期，生活的煎迫和事情的憂慮下，增加了我不少的白髮了，慶幸明兒還有生望，不然到現在我也骨枯了！在第十屋期，他才算連病帶罪，刑罰期滿而出獄。</p>
<p>且聽着！你的老母病了，病了四十九天，我有什麼可以請大夫爲她診治呢？每天她呻吟，每天我們挨餓。變賣盡了，在第四十九天，她就此重歸極樂國，跳出了我們的生活圈。又在無可如何的情形下，賣掉了不少衣服，爲她草草成殮，總算盡了一份爲人媳的責任，在困苦的條件下！</p>
<p>接連着，你的二弟又夭折了，也不知在什麼地方死的，總之是病着離開了家，至今不見他回來！</p>
<p>我把血和淚凝成了黑色的字跡，在人家歌舞昇平的時候，我抽噎着提起筆來，望着家人都倦睡在地下，我還有何面目迎接你呢？——還破碎了的家庭！但在矛盾的心裏，却時時懷念着你，爲國爭光的關士！</p>
<h3>紅樓夢的四個悲劇</h3>
<p>— 趙清閣</p>
<p>（紅樓夢劇本總序）</p>
<p>本劇根據「紅樓夢」原作，本諸研究態度從事改編。每册故事獨立；主題獨立；惟情節和時間還有聯系性。比如我把以寳·黛爲主的「詩魂冷月」排爲第一册；把以二尤爲主的「雪劍鴛鴦」排爲第二册；把以三春爲主的「流水飛花」排爲第三册；把以賈母賈政爲主的「禪林歸鳥」排爲第四册；這個發展程序，也正是「紅樓夢」原作的發展程序。</p>
<p>第一，二，三册我都分別在書首把寫作經過，以及主題的分析詳附序言。只有第四册沒有序，現在我就來補查數語。</p>
<p>「紅」學專家們把「紅樓夢」作了許多「索引」，大家紛紛不一地揣測着這部巨著的影射對象。有人說：「是作者曹雪芹先生自己的傳記」；也有人說：「是寫照滿淸時代的朝政」；我對於這些說法，覺得都有道理。曹雪芹先生如果沒有「紅樓夢」裏面所寫的那些風俗，習慣；人情，世故之生活閱歷；則他絕不可能描繪得那麼眞實。同樣的，因樣的，因爲曹雪芹先生對於他所存在的那個時代觀察得太透澈的原故，就不免感慨萬千，於是，才用他的智慧之筆，刻劃了那個時代的一切罪惡形態。「紅樓夢」的文學價値，便在於這些包含着人生哲理與社會哲理的深度上。如其親曹雪芹先生一傳記」的是他自己；勿寗說曹雪芹先生傳記了和他同時代的所有人。同時，曹雪芹先生豈但僅僅「寫照」的是滿淸時代之朝政；他簡直寫照的是歷代朝政，讀「紅樓夢」，固不可只在故事上着眼，而要去努力瞭解牠所啓示的哲理。研究「紅樓夢」，尤不應輕作狹義的索引，而須向遠處大處透視，這樣，你可以看出牠底遠大方面的反映。</p>
<p>「紅」劇第一册「詩魂冷月」，可謂之爲：個人的悲劇；第二册「雪劍鴛鴦」，可謂之爲：家庭的悲劇；第三册「流水飛花」，可謂之爲：社會的悲劇；第四册「禪林歸鳥」，可謂之爲：政治的悲劇。雖然，這樣區別不無牽强，但事實上也確是循着這四個階段深進的。我希望我這種改編方式，能够給「紅樓夢」的讀者，在理解方面有所帮助。</p>
<p>這些，都是由於時代的腐敗，造成了各種不同型的悲劇。這種時代的腐敗餘毒，至今還潛伏着若千的勢力，而不曾予以澈底的肅淸，撲滅；所以世界迄不太平，人類永無安樂！</p>
<p>「紅樓夢」裏面賈府之崩潰，不正是一個國家崩潰的縮影嗎？賈府爲什麼會到這步田地？其原因爲了家政的不良；家人的不團結；谷具私心；各存己見。乃至於崩潰。同樣的，一個國家會因爲國政的不良；國民的不團結；各自爭權；各自奪利；而至於崩潰。如曹雪芹所描寫的當時貪汚賄賂，營私舞弊之風，直到今天還瀰瀰可見；這證明了曹雪芹先生「透視」之正確。在「紅」劇第四册「禪林歸鳥」裏，我便特別把這點現實的反映正面表現了；同時側面我又把曹雪芹先生的一種超然宇宙觀，加以强調；我願望這能够促成一個時代的覺悟！</p>
<p>信筆淺說，或不免有所謬誤之處，還請高明指正。</p>

<h3>Dim Stars in the Azure Sky: Northeast Takeover Awaits Communication; National Army Captures Beizhen and Continues to Occupy Heishan</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 24th] On Christmas Eve, looking into the distance at the Northeast, there are dim stars in the azure sky. This is a confirmed report: Malinovsky has stated that he cannot assist the National Army in taking over Dalian, as it is not within his military district. Therefore, the Mayor of Harbin has already left for the Northeast to assume his post, while Mayor Shen Yi is still suffering from a toothache in Beiping. Regarding the takeover of Andong, the Soviets have also indicated that they cannot send liaison officers to assist, as there are no Soviet troops stationed there at all. Originally, provincial chairmen were ordered to arrive in the Northeast before New Year's Day, but due to the current circumstances, it may be extended to early January. Before the National Army can transport and station large numbers of troops in each province, a small number of troops will be sent as guards when each provincial chairman assumes office. Since the Northeast Headquarters moved to Beiping on the 17th of last month, it needs to establish itself in North China. Its jurisdiction now extends south to Dezhou and east to Shuhe, including Tianjin. The Northeast Headquarters, temporarily residing in Beiping, will soon relocate for the third time, with Tianjin, Jinzhou, and Changchun being possibilities. Director Xiong stated: "It depends on the Chairman's orders." When the Chairman was in Beiping, the elders of the Northeast gathered. Zhang Zuoxiang, Wang Shuhan, Zhai Wenxuan, and others from Beiping once visited the Chairman and held joint discussions. Afterwards, the Chairman kept Zhang Zuoxiang for a long private conversation. Ma Zhanshan, who fought hard in Suiyuan and Baotou and achieved remarkable results, is also receiving preferential treatment from Director Xiong here. These may not be entirely unrelated to the future of the Northeast. Additionally, it should be reported that, except for the Changchun Railway, the rest of the railway transportation in the Northeast is almost completely paralyzed due to the extreme shortage of locomotives and carriages. Usually, only coal-carrying vehicles are operating along the Changchun Railway. People in areas where the railway network is dense have to rely on donkeys, horses, and carts again. In the future, to ensure smooth transportation in the Northeast, the need for locomotives and carriages will be an enormous and staggering number. Liu Guangpei, the Director of the Northeast Branch of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, hurriedly flew to Changchun today. If he doesn't go, the clothing and other supplies allocated by the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to the Northeast will not be unloaded from the Chinese coast. The salaries of military officers in the Northeast have also been stipulated. It is generally said that a general's salary is 10,000 yuan in circulating currency, and Xiong Shihui is probably no exception. Recently, many personnel from the Rehe provincial government have arrived in Beiping, and Chairman Liu Duoquan is also exceptionally busy, seeming quite capable.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 25th] After our army captured Beizhen County on the 23rd, they advanced rapidly and occupied Dahushan (Tiger Mountain) Heishan at 4:00 AM on the 24th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 25th] After completing the first phase of takeover tasks, the National Army, which entered the Northeast, began its second advance on the 23rd. Troops on all fronts advanced more than 130 li (Chinese miles) in one day and night in temperatures below minus 20 degrees Celsius. The vanguard troops crossed Goubangzi and advanced north to Beizhen County, stationed in Heizhi County and Heishan County, and recovered Dahushan. The Communist army collapsed without being attacked. Our staff is in contact with the Soviet army in the Xinmin area. Once the connection is established, our army can enter Xinmin County and await orders to enter Shenyang.</p>
<p>[United Press, Jinzhou, 23rd] General Du Yuming's troops have begun to clear the Communist forces and miscellaneous troops in Rehe. A portion of General Du's troops is still awaiting Soviet permission to enter Shenyang. Another strong force has begun to advance from Goubangzi towards Beizhen. It is claimed that more than 10,000 Communist troops are garrisoned there. It is estimated that General Du plans to occupy Beizhen within a few days and then advance towards Heishan. Observers point out that the National Army's occupation of these cities in the Liaoning-Rehe border area could cut off the Northeast Communist forces from their new operational base in Zhangjiakou. Control of Rehe will give the National Army access to many land routes to the Northeast.</p>
<h3>Residents of Beizhen Welcome the National Army Empty Streets; Experts to Fly to the Northeast This Week; Supervisory Committee of Changchun Railway Holds First Meeting</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 25th] Xinmin County is about one hundred kilometers from Shenyang. After Chief Du arrived in Goubangzi, he supervised the advance of his troops. In the villages they passed, the residents came running to welcome them. When they arrived in Beizhen County, County Chief Yu Jinfan, who had entered the city with the army last night, led 20,000 residents to welcome them outside the city. Du got out of the car to return the salute and offer his condolences. Beizhen County has a population of 70,000 and more than 400 shops. After being ravaged by the Communist army for three and a half months, almost every household is empty. According to the town mayor and the chairman of the chamber of commerce, the Communist army levied funds on a per-household basis, requiring each household to pay 5,000 yuan. Shops paid 800,000 yuan, and banks were allocated 1.8 million yuan. In addition, important materials such as coal, salt, grain, and cloth in Beizhen County were all looted. The total public and private losses in the entire county exceeded 15 million yuan.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 25th] This morning, soldiers and civilians in Jinzhou held the first National Renaissance Celebration at the sports ground. General Du Yuming presided over the meeting and reported on the significance of the National Renaissance Festival. Another dispatch stated that the weather here today is extremely cold, with sleet and snow, the first rain and snow since winter. It is a good omen for a bumper harvest, and soldiers and civilians are expressing their joy.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 24th] The Supervisory Committee of the Changchun Railway held its first meeting at 11:00 AM today. The Chinese and Soviet chairmen and vice-chairmen, Levashev and Mo Dehui, and Chinese and Soviet supervisors Gao Lunjin, Qiu Weiying, Trupine, and Li Fangnuofu all attended. The meeting held a general discussion on the internal organization of the committee and its affiliated audit bureau, and it was decided to hold another meeting on the 26th.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 25th] The *Yi Shi Bao* here hints that the Soviet army transported away most of the vehicles before handing over Changchun to the representatives of the National Government. In a carefully worded essay, the newspaper stated that the only railway open to traffic in the Northeast is the Changchun Railway. Even on that line, all the railway equipment is old and dilapidated. The new locomotives and luxurious vehicles used by the Japanese and the Puppet Manchukuo authorities are nowhere to be seen. Prominent Chinese figures living outside the city of Changchun must travel by horse-drawn carriage.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Beiping, 25th] For fourteen years, Dong Jiu provinces have suffered under Japanese oppression. Today, they celebrate their first Christmas free from restraint. The Northeast is rich in resources, but the Japanese invasion led to World War II. It remains unclear whether it is under Soviet or Chinese administration. Changchun currently has a Chinese mayor, but his authority over the 800,000 Chinese people is still tightly controlled by the Soviet army. Without the support of the Soviet army, he cannot execute orders. However, the people of Changchun know that this is temporary and that they will see the National Army arrive within a week or two. The mayors of Shenyang, Harbin, and Dalian have led their entourages by plane to the north to prepare for their inaugurations. Only Dalian has experienced complications. Soviet Commander-in-Chief Malinovsky must send a liaison unit to guide the National Army into the city. According to a newspaper report, Malinovsky said that Dalian is not under his jurisdiction, so he cannot send liaison officers to guide the Chinese army. In fact, Malinovsky is the only official of the Soviet authorities in the Nine Provinces of the East who has made diplomatic contact with the Chinese side. General Xiong Shihui announced at a meeting of directors of the Northeast Headquarters, which is temporarily located here, that all economic and technical experts should prepare to fly to the Northeast this week. The Central Bank has established a branch in Changchun, and 30 employees left for the Northeast yesterday. A second batch will leave Beiping in a day or two.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 24th] Dong Yanping, Chief of Staff of the Northeast Headquarters, accompanied by Li Chengyi from the Beiping Office of the Northeast Security Command, arrived in Jinzhou by plane from Beiping to convey Director Xiong's condolences to Chief Du and to discuss matters related to the takeover of the Northeast.</p>
<h3>Pope Appoints Chinese as Cardinal Bishop</h3>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 23rd] Pope Pius XII announced today the list of 32 new cardinals (commonly known as red-robed archbishops), including one Chinese bishop who has also been newly appointed as a cardinal. This is the first time in the history of the Catholic Church that a Chinese person has been appointed as a cardinal. It is widely regarded as another proof of China's rising international status.</p>
<p>The newly appointed first Chinese cardinal is Archbishop Tian Gengxin, the Apostolic Administrator of Qingdao. Cardinal Tian was born in Yanzhou, Shandong in 1890. He was ordained as a priest in June 1918. In March 1929, he joined the Society of the Divine Word (the religious order that runs Fu Jen Catholic University in Beiping). In 1934, he was promoted to Prefect Apostolic of Yanggu, Shandong. In July 1939, he was promoted to Apostolic Vicar of Yanggu, given the title of bishop, and consecrated by Pope Pius XII in Rome in October of the same year. In 1943, he was transferred to Apostolic Vicar of Qingdao. Cardinal Tian is kind and gentle.

<h3>American Newspapers Discuss American-Soviet Relations in the Far East; Marshall Holds Frequent Social Gatherings; Met Soviet Ambassador at Randall's Banquet</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 24th] Howard newspaper's former correspondent in China, Lamo, stated: Marshall's appointment as special envoy to China will be a turning point in the situation in China, and the dawn of peace is breaking. The special correspondent first stated: "During the war, the Communists referred to Chairman Chiang as a fascist because the newspapers published by the Communists in Chongqing were subject to censorship. However, in reality, the Communists' activities were not significantly interfered with, while the National Government's request to publish newspapers in the Communist areas was rejected by the Communists. The Communists exaggerate their fighting power all day long. This propaganda is aimed at the United States, and its purpose is to induce us to abandon our financial and spiritual assistance to the National Government. Lamo also said: If the United States has abandoned its attention to China, the Soviet Union will take the opportunity to enter. The current disputes in the Northeast are a test of the United States, but Marshall's new appointment has changed the situation overnight, because Marshall's appointment has shown that the United States attaches importance to the situation in China.</p>

<h3>Provisional Meeting of the Standing Committee of the People's Political Council; Reviewing the Draft General Budget; Finance Minister Yu Personally Explains the Compilation Situation; Guiding Principle Is to Stabilize People's Livelihoods and Gradually Begin Construction</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Chongqing Dispatch, 25th] After the National Political Council obtained the power to review the government budget, it exercised its authority for the first time today. The standing committee of the council held a provisional meeting at 3:00 PM on the 25th to review the draft national revenue and expenditure budget for the 35th year of the Republic submitted by the government. Present were Chairman Zhang Boling, Wang Yunwu, Jiang Yong, Councilors Wu Zhaoxu, Chen Qitian, Zuo Shunsheng, Chen Shaoxian, Qian Gonglai, Chu Fucheng, Xu Deheng, He Baoren, Chen Bosheng, Hu Jianzhong, Hu Lin, Huang Yanpei, Yin Shuxian, Yu Jitang, Kong Geng, Fan Yushui, Chuan Sinian, Li Zhongxiang, Secretary-General Shao Lizi, and Deputy Secretary-General Lei Zhen. At today's first review meeting, Secretary-General Jiang Menglin of the Executive Yuan and Finance Minister Yu Hongjun were invited to attend and explain. Chairman Zhang Boling presided over the meeting. After a report from the Secretariat, Finance Minister Yu Hongjun explained the compilation of the national general budget for the 35th year of the Republic, giving a concise explanation of the process, guiding principles, and overall situation of revenue and expenditure. He stated that the guiding principle of the national general budget for the coming year is to stabilize people's livelihoods and gradually begin construction work. Wartime budgets required coordination with military affairs, resulting in huge military expenditures. In the draft budget for the coming year, military expenditures have been greatly reduced. In terms of general administrative expenses, the focus for the coming year will be on post-war rehabilitation, with particular emphasis on restoring transportation, managing water conservancy, and protecting agriculture and forestry. All new emerging industries must be coordinated with this guiding principle. In short, after the war, people's livelihoods are in a state of decline. Stabilizing people's livelihoods in the future will depend on price adjustments and financial stability, so that international trade and the domestic economy can be gradually promoted, and efforts will be made to balance revenue and expenditure in the financial sphere. After Yu's report, Jiang Menglin gave a supplementary explanation on the relationship between the budget and prices and the issue of rehabilitation, stating that stabilizing prices depends on adapting the supply and demand of materials. Rapid restoration of transportation will facilitate the flow of goods. At the same time, the materials supplied by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) will gradually lower prices, so that the national finances will gradually stabilize, and the government's revenue and expenditure can be expected to be implemented according to the budget. After the speeches, Councilors Huang Yanpei, Zuo Shunsheng, Xu Deheng, Chen Shaoxian, Yin Shuxian, Li Zhongxiang, and Chu Fucheng raised many questions regarding taxation, agriculture and forestry, military expenditure, and other issues, which Minister Yu answered one by one. Finally, it was decided to continue the meeting at 3:00 PM on the 27th and to invite the ministers of military affairs, transportation, and economic affairs to attend and report.</p>

<p>[Reuters Moscow Dispatch, 25th] Diplomatic circles here expect good news after Christmas. U.S. officials said yesterday that the Three Powers Conference is nearing completion and good results are expected. Some progress has been made on several issues discussed at the conference. When the three foreign ministers attended a play at the Bolshoi Theatre on Sunday night, Molotov held Bevin and Byrnes by the arms and gestured to the audience, who cheered enthusiastically. Such scenes are rare in Moscow. After the play, Bevin attended the French Embassy's Christmas reception and led diplomats in singing the hymn "We Are United," showing unusual delight. Byrnes, suffering from a slight cold, did not attend. Based on these various phenomena, diplomatic circles in Moscow are very optimistic about this Three Powers Conference. The conference is progressing rapidly, but the general public is still keen to keep a close watch, seeking a "panacea" for all post-war issues. Responsible parties have said that even if the Three Powers Conference does not have concrete solutions, at least a mechanism for cooperation has already begun to work.</p>
<h3>Kremlin Banquet for Guests</h3>
<p>Stalin Also Talks at Length with Bevin</p>
<p>[Reuters London Dispatch, 25th] Moscow Radio reported that Marshal Stalin hosted a banquet last night for Bevin and Byrnes. Other guests included Molotov, the British and American ambassadors to the Soviet Union, several Red Army generals, and Sir Jebb, the British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. Moscow Radio also announced that Stalin received Bevin at the Kremlin, along with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, British Under-Secretary of State Jebb, Soviet Ambassador to Britain Gusev, and British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Kerr. According to a dispatch from Moscow, a British spokesman said that Stalin's conversation with Bevin was "friendly and helpful."</p>
<p>[Reuters Washington Dispatch, 25th] Foreign affairs officials here stated yesterday that, according to recent reports from Moscow, mutual compromise at the Foreign Ministers' Conference has been painstakingly achieved. Diplomatic circles also said that the foreign ministers discussed a wide range of issues in detail in an attempt to issue a statement to the world, opening the curtain for the United Nations General Assembly next month.</p>
<h3>McNutt Reaffirms U.S. Policy Toward the Philippines</h3>
<p>[United Press Manila Dispatch, 25th] McNutt, the U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines who recently visited China, declared: "The rumor that I said Filipinos do not want independence is inaccurate. This statement is merely a report and not official. The United States' policy toward the Philippines is extremely clear. We have promised to grant the Filipinos independence on July 4, 1946. If the Filipinos do not want to obtain this status, the initiative should belong to the Filipinos. The United States will never take the initiative. The independence of the Philippines is no longer a question. Our work is how to prepare the Filipinos for independence. We cannot deviate from this goal and work."</p>
<h3>U.S. Expresses Dissatisfaction with Incomplete Prosecution of Philippine Traitors</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] According to a San Francisco broadcast on the 25th, the Philippines is not thoroughly prosecuting Philippine traitors. Senate President and presidential candidate Roxas is "the mastermind behind the purchase of military rice for the Japanese for a time." During the Japanese occupation, Roxas was the chairman of the Philippine Economic Committee. Most of the senators also cooperated with the Japanese. Local evening newspapers claim that the U.S. is extremely angry that the Philippine authorities have been slow to prosecute Philippine traitors. If the current Philippine government and the Philippine people do not immediately purge the "collaborators," the officials of the Laurel puppet government who previously worked for the Japanese will all regain their power. Philippine Liberal Party members point out that unless the U.S. participates in the prosecution of Philippine traitors, the Philippine traitors will be able to escape justice, because the current ruling party members are all friends of the Philippine traitors.</p>
<h3>Austrian Prime Minister Delivers Policy Outline</h3>
<p>[Reuters London Dispatch, 25th] Austrian Prime Minister Figl delivered a policy outline in parliament, forcefully arguing for the determination and methods of cooperation between the Catholic People's Party and the Socialist Party. Figl believes that the failure of the First Austrian Republic was due to the two parties' inability to compromise. Austrian President Renner and Vice-Chancellor Schaerf also share the same view. Figl said that although voters want free enterprise, state control of enterprises is currently necessary, and special enterprises should even be state-owned. This is because Austria's important industries were mostly stolen by the Nazis, so they cannot be quickly restored without state control. In terms of education, emphasis should be placed on training young people in democratic thinking.</p>
<h3>Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshida Deploys Tactics; Conspires to Alienate Allied Nations; Invites British Journalist to Lunch, Attacking U.S. Policies in Japan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Tokyo Dispatch, 25th] Japanese Foreign Minister Shigeru Yoshida's new diplomatic policy for occupied Japan is to alienate the Allied nations and make them enemies of each other. This old diplomat, devoid of diplomatic skill, has launched the first step of this conspiracy, attempting to use Britain to control the United States in order to "soften" the Allied nations' policy towards Japan. Yoshida first had an official from the Information Bureau invite two Irish journalists among the Allied journalists to lunch. His daughter then sent formal invitations to these two, namely Smith, the Reuters correspondent in Tokyo, and Deane, the London News Chronicle reporter, inviting them to lunch and adding a note that "her father will also be present at that time." When Smith and Deane arrived, they were first greeted by Yoshida's "private secretary," Shirase, who was closely related to the late Fumimaro Konoe. Shirase said, "If your American colleagues ask later why you had lunch with Foreign Minister Yoshida, please answer that it was invited by Yoshida's daughter, and Foreign Minister Yoshida was also present." During lunch, Yoshida, who is known for his inherent hatred of journalists, was unusually talkative. He said that the Emperor was very worried that MacArthur's orders were becoming increasingly strict and that an incident would definitely erupt in the future, and that the lack of rice could lead to upheaval. While Yoshida made this warning, the meal included egg noodles, fried lobster, roast beef, and butter, which had not been seen in Tokyo for two years, as well as fresh vegetables and tangerines for dessert. Yoshida then suddenly said in his unique and candid tone, "These orders are all from the hands of those who do not understand the situation in Japan at all. The American experts are like carps crossing the river." Yoshida then asked if there was anti-American sentiment in Britain, France, and other parts of Europe. He implied that if there were British people in Japan, everything would be very different, because they understood the situation in the Far East. Yoshida then excused himself to attend an important meeting. His secretary said at the end of the meal, "You are both Irish, and you should know the emotions of the people in occupied countries." Who knew that the angry guests invited by Yoshida's daughter had reported the above to MacArthur's headquarters. A senior official at headquarters commented, "This fact coincides with the current concepts of the Japanese cabinet." An editorial in the Japanese Sangyo Keizai Shimbun this morning stated that Japanese officials are exaggerating the various difficulties in Japan, as well as the various difficulties faced by Japanese residents in northern Korea and the Northeast, in an attempt to cover up their own mistakes and incompetence. The newspaper also accused officials who previously worked in the now-dissolved Greater East Asia Ministry of neglecting their duties during the difficult and urgent times after the surrender, leaving the Japanese people at a loss.

<p>[Reuters London Dispatch, 25th] Leming, a political commentator for Moscow Radio, broadcast that the work of the Preparatory Committee of the United Nations is an important page in the history of good countries. The most important item on the Preparatory Committee's agenda is the issue of trusteeship, which is the most important issue after the war.

<h3>Papal Christmas Message: Three Basic Conditions for Establishing Lasting Peace</h3>
<p>[United Press Vatican City, 25th] On Christmas Eve, the Pope broadcast to the world, stating that the world is not at peace, but merely in a "post-war" state. Regarding true and lasting peace, the Pope put forward the following three points: (1) Cooperation, goodwill, and mutual trust between nations are currently needed. (2) All systems of checking public opinion that guide the will and thought of the elected must be condemned. (3) All sectors of the world must urge totalitarian countries to immediately cease their hegemonic behavior.</p>
<p>International Need for Goodwill and Mutual Trust, Totalitarianism and Democracy Incompatible</p>
<p>[Reuters] The full text of the Pope's broadcast is as follows: "Totalitarianism and true and sound democratic systems cannot coexist. Totalitarian regimes have stained the earth red with blood, destroying the existence of nations, and the world can never escape the threat of war. The purpose of future peace institutions should be to eliminate the will to aggression and eradicate aggressive forces. Dictatorial actions, whether internal or external, should be stopped uniformly. In this chaotic world, there is only one solution: to return to the embrace of God and obey God's will. Although the war is over, the world has not entered true peace; peace is only in the preparatory stage. Never before have those responsible for restoring peace borne such a heavy responsibility. Humanity has now awakened to the importance of wisdom, patience, and goodwill for world peace and order." The Pope continued, "The supernatural and indivisible nature of the Church is like that of Jesus Christ himself. The wholeness of Christ means that the head and the body must be inseparable; this is the wholeness of life, applicable to all mankind at any time and in any place. Therefore, anyone who makes the Church a captive of any nation insults all of humanity. The current situation requires close cooperation of all kinds and reduction of political competition. To preserve future freedom, the inner strength of individuals must be enhanced. Full cooperation is necessary between people and between nations. So-called public opinion must not be manipulated by money; the true and free will of the majority must be respected, and the existence of dictatorship and arbitrary regimes must never be tolerated. This year, as we celebrate Christmas, we can be free from fear of threats on land, sea, and air. This is the first truly joyful Christmas in six years, and we should thank God."</p>
<p>US President Issues General Amnesty, Four Thousand Prisoners Released</p>

<h3>Japanese Assets in Korea All Taken Over by US Military</h3>
<p>[United Press, Gyeongseong, Korea, 24th] The US military government here has taken over all Japanese property rights and interests in the US-occupied area. This has been announced by Major General Annand, the acting military governor. It is said that this move is to eliminate Japanese control. The assets taken over include all property, whether private or state-owned. The US military will hand over the property immediately after the Korean government finds suitable personnel to take it over.</p>
<h3>Communist Party Gathering in Italy Attacked with Poison Gas Bomb</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 25th] A communiqué from the Italian authorities broadcast by Rome Radio stated that at 5:00 PM yesterday, when Communist leaders were gathering in a large venue in Rome, someone threw a poison gas bomb, which exploded on the spot, shattering glass windows. The poisonous gas entered the meeting room, and some people present showed symptoms of poisoning. First aid was immediately administered to prevent serious harm.

<h3>Santa Claus Descends from the Sky</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Batavia, 25th] Yesterday, the Royal Air Force dropped Santa Claus by parachute to areas where expatriates were concentrated, such as Bandung and Buitenzorg. Santa Claus's belly and the two bags he carried were filled with sweets and other items donated by Air Force personnel.</p>
<h3>East Indian Independence Leader Returns to Batavia After Tour; Heavy Fighting Continues in Bandung Area</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Batavia, 25th] Indonesian President Sukarno, after touring central and eastern Java with Prime Minister Sjahrir and others, stated that the local security forces have agreed to assist in transporting Allied expatriates and Japanese troops to the Allied authorities. The result of his trip has further convinced him that the people have firm support for his government. He also met with many local leaders, some of whom he had never met before. The lack of cooperation in the past was part of the reason for some unfortunate events.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Batavia, 25th] According to the Dutch news agency, the extremist leader Hartje in the Bandung area has been killed in battle. Hartje often sold amulets to Indonesians, claiming that having these amulets would protect them from all harm. After Hartje's death, Indonesians began to believe that amulets were just that.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Batavia, 25th] Yesterday, British airborne troops were attacked by Indonesian extremists while searching the Kramat area outside the city, injuring ten people. The British troops captured 25 people and seized some weapons and ammunition. However, the Indonesian people no longer seem to fear the extremists. In the Bandung area, Indian troops are clearing the southeastern area of the city. On Sunday, they captured 70 people, including several members of the "Black Buffalo" association. The Allied headquarters in the Buitenzorg refugee area between Bandung and Batavia was attacked with hand grenades. As of Friday, the Allies had suffered 16 deaths, 795 injuries, and 163 missing.</p>

The purpose of their sending this telegram is to prepare those who will attend the London conference.</p>
<h3>National Revelry in the United States; Anxious Mood Difficult to Conceal Amidst Superficial Joy</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 24th] For the first time in five years, Americans are holding peacetime Christmas celebrations. It is said that they are preparing to make this Christmas the happiest since the Pearl Harbor incident. The busy sales of Christmas gifts in department stores have broken records, and the number of Christmas cards and packages sent by the post office is also the largest. The congestion of holiday travel is also unprecedented in the United States. Americans can enjoy five pounds of meat for Christmas dinner; only the most fortunate of the countries participating in the war, the United States, where the impact of the war has been minimal, has this possibility. However, amidst the superficial joy, there is still an anxious mood. Today's Christmas messages in various newspapers all remind Americans that most of the world is filled with misery and misfortune. While the United States can enjoy the blessings of prosperity, it is by no means without difficulties in domestic and foreign affairs. For example, labor strikes are still ongoing, industrial recovery is particularly slow, and consumer goods are still lacking, especially clothing. Chronic inflation continues, and the shortage of housing is becoming more serious. Therefore, while Americans celebrate this first peacetime Christmas since 1941, although conditions are superior to those of other countries in the world, they, like other countries, cannot but produce fear and hope.</p>
<h3>Patton Buried Deep Underground; His Military Achievements Will Endure Forever</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lintfort, 25th] General Patton's remains were buried yesterday in a solemn ceremony at the Hamm American Military Cemetery near Luxembourg. Thousands of American military personnel attended the funeral, and many residents lined the streets to watch.</p>
<p>[United Press Special Feature] General Patton was injured in a jeep accident and died of his injuries last week. General Patton was a veteran of over thirty years, known for his strict discipline in commanding troops. The general was a brilliant genius among professional soldiers, often surprising his peers, and single-handedly brought tank warfare to perfection. However, when it came to diplomatic matters, he was unable to cope and was often in an awkward situation. During World War II, the general fought his way from Africa through France, Germany, Austria, and Czechoslovakia, winning every battle and conquering every city. During the African campaign, the general was already widely praised. It is said that when conquering Tunisia, he wore two pearl-handled pistols on his waist, roared like a tiger, and took the lead in charging with tanks. The general was always in danger, always on the front line, believing that this was the privilege of officers. His operational secrets included the following maxim: "We must constantly attack the enemy until we are exhausted, and then attack again." The Third Army, which was established after the invasion of France, achieved brilliant results, which was the result of applying the above maxim.</p>
<h3>Defenders of Mahabad in Northwestern Iran Continue to Resist</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tehran, 25th] The Iranian Army General Headquarters received a telegram stating that the government defense forces in Mahabad in northwestern Iran have not yet surrendered to the communist forces and are continuing to resist. This is the only city in the province that has not surrendered to the communist forces.</p>
<h3>Former Spanish Republican Prime Minister Arrives in London</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 24th, Reuters] Former Spanish Republican Prime Minister Negrín arrived in London on the Queen Mary.</p>
<h3>Christmas in Berlin: Using Cleavers to Chop Branches for Firewood and Filling Up on Greased Black Bread</h3>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 24th] In front of a public building in Berlin, there is a notice that reads, "Only those who die from infectious diseases can get a coffin." Next to it is an ambassador made of cardboard, saying, "Merry Christmas, may there be peace on earth and goodwill to all men." This is the scene of Christmas in Berlin this year. In the past, this German capital also indulged in wild revelry, with Nazi soldiers goose-stepping and marching, invincible, but now it is a bleak sight. All that can be seen are broken tiles, dilapidated walls, and people with sunken eyes. Although they are grateful for the arrival of peace, they look forward to a dim future and are also at a loss. The zoo used to be a famous park in the city center. Elderly men and women with tired steps are pulling several carts, which are full of branches. When they take a short rest on the side of the road, they take out black bread smeared with lard to eat. This is their Christmas feast. In the once magnificent garden, women in expensive fur coats are seen chopping the remaining tree trunks with cleavers, picking up small pieces of wood to keep warm. This scene is not harmonious. At the same time, in the city hall, thin, pale-faced children are waiting for the Santa Claus rally. Many of them were disabled by bombing during the war. Each person can get a toy, some warm clothes, and a piece of food with a little sugar. The "Save the Children" campaign in the city has at least achieved some success. On the street, an old man is seen sticking strips of cloth on the shutters and muttering to himself, saying that the cardboard on the window fell off last night. His wife is lying in bed, gasping for breath. Most poor families have no Christmas tree this year. Although there are thousands of trees brought to the market for sale, priced at one to eight marks, most are bought by those willing to pay twenty times this price.</p>
<h3>Beiping and Tianjin Enthusiastically Comfort Allied Troops; Wang Shuming Represents Chairman Chiang to Present Gifts; Capital Holds First Post-War Christmas Celebration Service</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 25th] When Chairman Chiang left Beiping, he personally instructed Wang Shuming, Deputy Director of the Aviation Committee, to convey to the military and political leaders of Beiping and Tianjin that he would represent Chairman Chiang in comforting the Allied troops on Christmas Day. Representatives from the General Headquarters of the Military Affairs Commission, the Municipal Government, the Air Force Headquarters, the Battlefield Service Corps, and other agencies discussed and determined the method of consolation. On the 25th, 7,000 kilograms of wine and 7,000 kilograms of beef were prepared and distributed to American soldiers in Beiping. In addition, Deputy Director Wang, on behalf of the Chairman, presented precious items such as ancient bottles and paintings to senior American generals, and also distributed enamel toys and more than 500 beautiful silk scarves printed with the characters "Chiang" and "V" and the Allied victory to officers at all levels. A cocktail party was held at the Beijing Hotel on the evening of the 26th to entertain guests. Deputy Director Wang, on the 23rd, returned to Beiping from Chairman Chiang by special plane and immediately contacted Mayor Zhang and Deputy Mayor Du of Tianjin to discuss consolation matters. It is reported that Tianjin's preparations are more enthusiastic and grand than Beiping's. From Christmas Day to the 5th of next year, there will be consolation programs every day.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] Today is the first Christmas after World War II. Churches in Nanjing held a music celebration service at Hanzhong Church on Mochou Road at 2:00 PM. Hang Liwu was invited to give a Christmas speech. In the evening, the Battlefield Service Corps of the Military Affairs Commission and the Allied forces in Nanjing held a grand party at the International Friendship Society, and the Catholic Church also held a Christmas Mass.</p>
<h3>Christmas in the Old Capital: First Time in Eight Years Without Threats and Humiliation</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Beiping, 24th] This is the first time in eight years that the citizens of Beiping have been able to welcome Christmas without threats and humiliation, but Christmas here is not all happy. To borrow someone else's phrase, Beiping is still a Dragon City. Although this refugee population is expanding day by day, hundreds of thousands of out-of-town residents are still trapped in Beiping after the victory and cannot return to their villages. How many people have waited for eight years, looking to the door every day, and still not seeing the return of their exiled children. After the factories were taken over, most of them stopped operating, and unemployed workers were struggling in the cold, let alone starvation. Even the staff retained by various agencies are worried about their insufficient salaries after the probation period is over. Although American children embrace Beiping ladies and enjoy American meat hotpots while remembering their wives across the ocean, they will also feel sad. But the most unhappy people are Wang Yintai, Wang Kemin, and others in prison. Are they thinking about this night last year, when they were gambling all night or playing with women?</p>
<p>The Chairman came a little early, otherwise he would have been Santa Claus for Beiping. He brought justice and warmth to the people of the old capital, and especially allocated food and coal for the winter to hard-working students. He sowed the seeds of permanent remembrance in the hearts of the people of Beiping. Zhang Puquan and Lu Ruibo, two elders who happened to be there, acted as Santa Claus for the old capital in 1945. The large bags they carried were full of soap, washing away the dirt that should not have been on the faces of the people in the occupied areas. Lu comforted the compatriots in North China, saying that except for a few traitors, everyone, whether in the rear or in the occupied areas, has made a considerable contribution to the victory. Zhang said something even more popular: the so-called "pseudo" character, I believe, should be abolished from today. We only ask whether someone is a traitor or not, and there is no question of whether something is "pseudo" or not. This soap is the most precious gift for the people in the occupied areas. The indiscriminate use of the "pseudo" character for the past three months has been too heartbreaking. On Christmas Eve, apart from the all-night dance parties of American soldiers and a few people, music was constantly heard from high-rise buildings, but the general public had already fallen asleep. Perhaps they were dreaming that the flour and cloth from the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, free of tax, had already been delivered to their doorsteps.</p>
<h3>Local Correspondences</h3>
<p>Songjiang</p>
<p>Temporary Issuance of Substitute Coupons for Purchasing Military Grain</p>
<p>This county has repeatedly received orders from the province to purchase 50,000 shi of military grain, priced at 5,000 yuan per shi, with half to be delivered by the 20th of this month and the remainder to be delivered by February 15th of next year. Because the allocated funds are only 35 million yuan, it is difficult to comply with the order to purchase all the grain. In addition, the county treasury is in deficit, and there is no way to raise funds. After discussions among various agencies, legal entities, and gentry, it was decided to temporarily issue military grain substitute coupons as proof of grain purchase, which will not circulate in the market. It is rumored that a public announcement will be made for allocation and payment as soon as the province's funds arrive.</p>
<p>Changshu</p>
<p>Launching County-Wide Pacification Work</p>
<p>The pacification work in the county began with a thorough overnight census of urban households on the 20th and has now been extended to various rural areas. Near Lao Xu Township, the bandit Zhao Zhenhua's force of more than 100 people, with more than 20 rifles and more than 20 pistols, claiming to be the Chang Kun Tai Self-Defense Corps, has been defeated by the National Army. The military and political authorities have recently issued a notice that any bandits or mixed forces who surrender and confess to the garrison and district offices will be treated leniently. Those who surrender their weapons will be rewarded.</p>
<p>Suzhou</p>
<p>Arch-Traitor Zhang Beisheng Sentenced to Death</p>
<p>Arch-traitor Zhang Beisheng, who successively held key military and political positions in the puppet organization Jiangsu Pacification Office Secretary-General, Jiangsu Police Department Chief, and Subei Administrative Inspector, committed heinous crimes. After being arrested, he was handed over to the Jiangsu High Court for investigation and trial. On the morning of the 24th, at 11:00 AM, the verdict was announced. Zhang Beisheng colluded with enemy countries, conspired to resist his own country, and held military positions related to military affairs, and should be sentenced to death, with his property confiscated.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>Organizing Post-War Relief Association</p>
<p>County Magistrate Fan Tinsheng was ordered to organize a Post-War Relief Association to comfort refugees and stabilize people's livelihoods. He has joined forces with the county party headquarters to begin preparations and plans to hire Xin Zenghui, Shen Jizhi, and 34 others as committee members. The first committee meeting is scheduled for the 29th of this month.</p>
<p>Xicheng Long-Distance Bus Service Resumes; Traffic between Wuxi and Jiangyin is available by small steamers on the waterways and by commercial cars on the land routes. However, small cars often suffer illegal extortion during their journeys, and passengers complain endlessly. Xicheng Long-Distance Bus Company plans to start operating four large trucks from the 26th to maintain traffic between Xicheng.</p>
<p>Jiangyin</p>
<p>Continuing Investigation of the Chang Xiao Fortress</p>
<p>General Kong Qinggui, Director of the National Fortress Investigation Team of the Ministry of Military Affairs, inspected the Huangshan Fortress in Cheng and, on the 22nd, continued to set off with his entourage to investigate the Chang Xiao fortresses on both mountains. He also drew detailed diagrams of the artillery positions and various military equipment on the two mountains, which took three hours to complete. It is reported that Director Kong's investigation mission in Cheng has been completed and he will leave Cheng for Beijing within a few days.</p>
<p>Jiaxing</p>
<p>Health Bureau Director Suddenly Shot</p>
<p>Yu Guqiu, Director of the Jiaxing County Health Bureau, because the former Director Yao Erkang had not yet handed over clearly, repeatedly urged him to complete the handover, causing Yao to harbor resentment. Recently, Yao was also under economic pressure. On the afternoon of the 22nd, at around 2:00 PM, he carried a pistol and broke into the bureau. He had a fierce verbal conflict with Director Yu, immediately raised his gun and fired two shots, injuring Director Yu's wife, Ms. Xu, in the arm. Yao, seeing that he had caused trouble, fled outwards. The police bureau learned of the matter and immediately launched an investigation. They first detained Yao's wife, Ms. Wu. After a while, Yao turned himself in to the police bureau to await transfer for investigation.</p>
<p>Bengbu</p>
<p>Building Railways and Repairing Highways</p>
<p>The Hepu (Hefei to Pukou) Railway has long been planned for construction, but the incident was delayed, causing construction to fail. According to reliable information from the Anhui Highway Bureau, the road construction plan is currently being drafted in detail. As for the repair of highways, the Wartime Transportation Administration is actively rushing to repair them. It is reported that the Jingwu section of the Jinggan National Highway is under construction, so that it can run directly from Nanjing to Chongqing, which is expected to be completed within a month. The surface of the roads in northern Anhui, with Hefei as the center, including the Helu, Hebeng, Hean, Hede, Huaihai lines, and in southern Anhui, with Tunxi as the center, including the Tunwu, Tunan, Tunhai lines, are all planned to be repaved with gravel. The total cost of the project is estimated at 200 million yuan, and a request for subsidies is being submitted to the central government. Currently, transportation on various lines is temporarily handled by 40 vehicles allocated by the Tenth War Zone Command, while another request is submitted to the Ministry of Communications for the allocation of new vehicles to enhance transportation capacity.</p>

<h3>Tianjin After Liberation: Heading Towards Revival and Prosperity, Translated by Our Editorial Office from the December 24th *Ta Mei Wan Bao* (North China American Daily)</h3>
<p>Post-liberation Tianjin has seen few changes in its appearance, fundamentally remaining much like it was before the war. American Marine Corps vehicles speed along the streets of Tianjin, each jeep adorned with a uniquely conceived name.</p>
<p>The headquarters of the Third Amphibious Corps is located in the former French Concession's grandiose *gong bu* (municipal council) building. Various regimental headquarters and military offices are scattered throughout the city. American soldiers in leather-collared winter uniforms and short leather jackets are unusually active everywhere. All of Tianjin's English street signs were removed by the Japanese and replaced with wooden boards.</p>
<p>Low Prices, Still Priced in Counterfeit Currency</p>
<p>Prices in Tianjin are much cheaper than in Shanghai, but Tianjin residents still find them very expensive. For example, pork sells for 220 National Currency (Guo Bi) per pound. Wheat flour, the staple food of the North, is slightly more expensive than in Shanghai, costing about 140 National Currency per pound. Bread costs around 116 National Currency per pound. Chunk coal costs about 8,000 to 9,000 National Currency per ton. The Kailan Mining Administration no longer sells coal to private individuals as it once did. Tianjin "locals" still price goods using counterfeit Federal Reserve Bank of China notes. If they are priced in National Currency, they will immediately discount it to one-fifth of its value. For some reason, currency exchange dealers on the streets are not very welcoming of Customs Gold Units.</p>
<p>Telegraph Communications Awaiting Active Adjustment</p>
<p>Transportation in North China remains obstructed. There is still no officially fixed transportation method between Tianjin and Shanghai. Any ships that do set sail are managed by the Military Affairs Commission. A few small ships of about 300 tons travel between Tianjin and Qingdao, but the safety of these ships cannot be absolutely guaranteed at present.</p>
<p>China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) is not yet selling tickets to ordinary passengers. Only military and government personnel are allowed to board CNAC planes. Telegraph communications are also not very reliable; sending a telegram from Tianjin to Shanghai often takes one and a half to two days.</p>
<p>American Banks Permitted to Open Current Accounts</p>
<p>On December 20th, the Tianjin branches of two American banks, Chase Bank and National City Bank of New York, reopened. Chase Bank Manager Mr. Felt and Chief Accountant Mr. Schmidt, and National City Bank of New York Manager Mr. Towle and Chief Accountant Mr. Henry, all received many flower baskets and gifts from friends and old customers, and many people came to offer their congratulations. Neither bank has opened savings accounts yet, only current accounts in National Currency or US dollars. Old accounts from before require special permission to be unfrozen. The remittance of National Currency between Tianjin and Shanghai has not yet begun. According to Mr. Towle, "I am very optimistic about the future."</p>
<p>Swords Selling Well, General Market Conditions Ordinary</p>
<p>Many of the old companies in Tianjin that have resumed operations are open in name only; there is simply no business to be done. The North China interior is completely isolated from Tianjin and Peiping (Beijing), so it seems that import and export trade cannot be restored for the time being. Most Tianjin residents place great hope in Special Envoy Marshall's visit to China. However, a small number of people feel very pessimistic about the future.</p>
<p>Today, Tianjin seems like a city of bars and antique shops. Their trade targets are the American soldiers. The business of exchanging foreign currency is thriving, especially around the Victoria Cafe in the former British Concession. Recently, due to the severe weather, the volume of transactions has inevitably been affected. Among the items sold by street vendors, Japanese military swords sell the best, because American soldiers are most fond of hunting for souvenirs. It is doubtful whether these Japanese military swords are genuine "war trophies." Even Japanese sword experts would probably not be able to tell the difference. It is estimated that American soldiers have spent about seven million US dollars in North China so far, with particularly large sums spent in Tianjin, Peiping, Qingdao, and Qinhuangdao.</p>
<p>The Tianjin Municipal Government recently issued a notice prohibiting men and women from sharing rickshaws, which is quite a disappointment for the soldiers. If the soldiers in Shanghai hear about this news, they will surely have special feelings and hope that Shanghai does not follow suit.</p>
<p>Gold and US Dollars: Market Prices Lower Than in Shanghai</p>
<p>Banks in Tianjin, both Chinese and foreign, do not handle remittances between Tianjin, Shanghai, and other cities in Central China, because of the difficulty of transferring funds and transportation difficulties. The market price of gold and US dollars in Tianjin tends to be lower than in Shanghai, so it is likely that many people are engaging in arbitrage to adjust their positions. US dollar bills in Tianjin are currently around 980 National Currency, but the degree of fluctuation is more severe than in the Shanghai market.</p>
<h3>The Elevator Stops Halfway, Hair is Half-Permed, Light is Half-Shining: France Overcomes Difficulties This Winter, Translated from *Newsweek* President Carroll's Original Article</h3>
<p>The recent political unrest in France, which began after the vote of confidence in the government, has come to an end. The parliament will spend seven months studying the constitution. During this period, there is nothing to be done in politics, so the French government has begun to calm down and consider how to get through the winter. President de Gaulle arrives at the office very early and leaves very late every day. The only visible change is that he has taken off his military uniform and put on civilian clothes. The most serious difficulties faced by de Gaulle and the French people this winter will be coal shortages and electricity conservation.</p>
<p>A Lump of Coal Equals a Golden Ingot</p>
<p>Two charcoal trucks collided on the road, and several bags of coal fell from the trucks to the roadside. A little child cried out frantically: "Mom, Mom, there's coal here!" In an instant, a large crowd gathered. Many people grabbed handfuls of coal and ran away, jumping and skipping. A dignified old man picked up a piece of coal, praised it with a reminiscent look, as if it were a beautiful shell or a golden ingot.</p>
<p>No French person does not pay attention to coal. The headlines in the newspapers are all about coal. A female soldier in the British army discovered that her maid was stealing coal. She smuggled coal out of the coal bin in her handbag, piece by piece, until she had stolen almost half a ton. Currently, black market coal prices are between 180 and 240 US dollars, and it is still not easy to buy.</p>
<p>No Answer at the Door, Pick Up a Pebble and Hit the Window</p>
<p>Because of the coal shortage, electricity must be conserved. To conserve electricity, the power is cut off several times a day, for one hour each time. The elevator stops halfway, cutting off the electricity and suspending passengers halfway up or down for as long as an hour. In the barber shop, the perm is only half-done when the electricity goes out, and the curling iron pulls the customer's hair straight and tight, making it impossible to move. Telephones are even busier, because for a very long time each day, there is no dial tone, the doorbell does not ring, and people knocking on the door have to pick up a pebble and hit the window. The French have to remember every day when there is electricity and when there is no electricity, and they must be careful everywhere and pay attention at all times. Therefore, half of their time and energy is wasted on this. In peacetime, when there is a prolonged drought, affecting hydropower generation, insufficient electricity can be compensated for with coal. Since France was liberated, the French coal industry has immediately worked valiantly to restore domestic coal mines and resume operations in the Saar coal mines. Of course, mechanical failures, miners' lack of food and clothing, and a shortage of pit props are major obstacles. However, coal production is constantly increasing, and now it is able to produce 147,000 tons of coal per day, that is, 53.635 million tons of coal per year, which is more than 6 million tons more than normal production.</p>
<p>Emergency Measures: Shops Strictly Prohibited from Using Electric Lights</p>
<p>However, in peacetime, France needs to import 20 million tons of coal every year, but now it cannot import that much to make up for the amount it lacks. For example, the amount imported from the United States in September was 406,700 tons, but in October, due to the US miners' strike, it dropped to 380,200 tons. What is worse is that France cannot obtain the expected amount of coal from the Ruhr area. It was expected to obtain 313,000 tons in November, but as of November 16, only 8,700 tons had been received.</p>
<p>In such an embarrassing situation, the Paris municipal authorities had to take new emergency electricity-saving measures. All non-essential factories are only allowed to operate three days a week. Families and offices are absolutely prohibited from using any electricity except for two hours at noon. Shop windows are prohibited from using electric lights. All shops, except for food stores and pharmacies, must close at 5 or 6 o'clock in the afternoon. Subways also enter the depot one hour earlier. Writing this, the translator has a few words to add here:</p>
<p>The current situation in Paris reminds us of Shanghai before the victory. At that time, Shanghai was also implementing emergency electricity-saving measures. Most factories had to close due to power outages, or they tried to install charcoal engines as a substitute. At the same time, the Japanese military factories were operating day and night. Under air raid precautions, the streets were dark. Families and hotels used old-fashioned soybean oil lamps and candles to replace electric lights. The worst were those who lived in high-rise buildings, because elevators stopped working, and they had to run up and down the stairs, panting for breath.</p>
<p>Now, the light has come, and thanks to the efforts of the government and the assistance of the American army, the difficulties here have finally been resolved to a considerable extent. When we see the situation in Paris today, how can we not be happy for ourselves and express our heartfelt sympathy to the unfortunate citizens of Paris?</p>
<h3>Northeast Statistics</h3>
<p>Northeast steel production is two million tons per year. These steel mills are quite small by American standards, but very large by Far Eastern standards. They can be expanded to assist in the industrialization of Asia.</p>
<p>Chemical industry production includes industrial alcohol, chemical fertilizers, cement industry raw materials, etc. These factories have abundant raw materials and can also be expanded.</p>
<p>Lumber mills produce large quantities of lumber because the Northeast has an inexhaustible supply of wood, which is sufficient for China to rebuild houses, factories, railways, and other necessities for modernization.</p>
<p>Mines produce large quantities of coal, copper, lead, zinc, and a considerable amount of gold.</p>
<p>Machine factories can manufacture locomotives, railcars, assemble automobiles, and manufacture gasoline engines and other machinery.</p>
<p>Gasoline plants refine gasoline and fuel oil for industrial use from shale.</p>
<p>Other factories are also complete and usable, capable of producing a large number of different goods, ranging from simple agricultural implements and synthetic rubber tires to paper, plastics, vegetable oil, and paint.</p>
<p>Therefore, China has now received this large inheritance. Although it has 450 million people, who are generally impoverished, with the industry and natural resources of the Northeast, it can form a single, large industrial country. However, China has very little experience in operating large enterprises, and how it will utilize them remains to be seen. (US Information Service)</p>

<h3>The Recent Eloquent Discourses of Three Diplomatic Giants</h3>
<p>Byrnes is the United States Secretary of State, a confidant of the late President Roosevelt. He accompanied the President to the Crimea Conference. On April 2, 1945, he resigned from the position of Director of War Mobilization and Reconversion, intending to retire to his hometown. However, ten days later, President Roosevelt died, and he flew back to Washington to assist President Truman. On July 2, 1945, he was appointed Secretary of State. This October, he participated in the Five-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference in London. Recently, he has had important discussions on the issue of international cooperation:</p>
<p>Byrnes</p>
<p>The World Should be the Home of All Nations</p>
<p>"We now live in a world where, in this atomic age, regional isolationism is even more dangerous than national isolationism.</p>
<p>If our world is divided into spheres of influence and privileged areas, then the kind of cooperation necessary for peace is unthinkable.</p>
<p>The Moscow Declaration of 1943 is important because it pointed this out. This joint declaration made by the world's largest and strongest nations promised the mutual cooperation needed to win victory and maintain peace. It is truly a milestone in our efforts to establish a national society and abandon the untrustworthy international relations system based on spheres of influence.</p>
<p>After the Moscow Four-Power Declaration, there followed the Dumbarton Oaks Conference, the Yalta Conference, the Crimea Conference, the San Francisco Conference, and the Potsdam Conference. The United Nations organization and the London Foreign Ministers' Conference were also established in the spirit of the Moscow Declaration.</p>
<p>In my recent report on the London Foreign Ministers' Conference, I solemnly pointed out that international cooperation requires intelligent compromise. This principle does not require us or any other country to ignore its special relationship with its neighbors, but it does require that all good neighborly relations be coordinated with an organized system of global international relations.</p>
<p>The world system we are striving to build must adhere to the principle of equal national sovereignty.</p>
<p>This principle does not mean that all countries are equal in strength and power, because their inequality is like the strength and power of individuals. But it does mean that the independence and sovereignty of large and small countries should be equally respected. Nations, like individuals, should be equal before the law. This principle is the cornerstone of our Pan-American system and should also be the cornerstone of the United Nations.</p>
<p>If we are to achieve lasting peace, it is necessary to adopt the above-mentioned principles for the establishment of peace. Because lasting peace is indivisible. It is not only a matter of concern to a few great powers or a few large groups, but a matter of concern to the people of the whole country.</p>
<p>The United States believes in this, and therefore believes that all countries, large and small, that bear the responsibility of combat must participate in the work of building peace.</p>
<p>Over the past centuries, some strong nations have divided the world for various reasons. But they have all failed, and their failures have left a bloody trail in history. Now that all the countries of the world have become neighbors, it will be even more difficult to succeed in dividing them.</p>
<p>Today, the world must choose. The world should be the home of all nations, not the world of one nation."</p>
<p>Bevin's Policies</p>
<p>Bevin has broad knowledge and great ambitions. He has more boldness than Eden. Bevin's diplomatic experience is very different from Eden's, and even if diplomacy is handled entirely by the foreign minister, his policies will not be the same as Eden's.</p>
<p>He is Not Like the Thorough Eden</p>
<p>Bevin will absolutely not be like the thorough Eden. I believe he may achieve great success, not only because today's foreign policy is largely decided jointly by the cabinet. Bevin is a man with a strong democratic consciousness, sufficient experience, and great boldness—he may ignore all outdated foreign policies and the foreign policy passed by the Labour Party Congress last December and go his own way. When reviewing the Labour Party's attitude towards major foreign policy issues, we should not ignore the most important fact that Bevin's personal views have a great influence on it.</p>
<p>For example, the Potsdam Declaration on the future of Germany should be viewed together with Bevin's usual views. We may wish to look at Bevin's speech at the banquet for representatives of workers from various countries at the World Federation of Trade Unions this spring, the Labour Party's Blackpool Congress, and his foreign policy speech in Parliament. He explained that the German people should recognize their responsibilities and do their utmost to compensate for the losses of European countries. He also explained that it is unusual to plunge Germany into large-scale unemployment and an economic mess in which people struggle on the starvation line. Undoubtedly, he did explain that Germany should restore democracy and the freedom to organize trade unions. His words were not a smokescreen to mislead people, and he did not support those reactionary elements who tried to maintain the old social order.</p>
<p>The key to Bevin's diplomatic speech lies in its emotional richness in international relations. Bevin looks at international relations from the perspective of workers and ordinary people without homes or jobs, not from the perspective of power politics and abstract emotions.</p>
<p>What Bevin said at Blackpool was the most meaningful. He said: "America is a country that advocates private investment. The Soviet Union has socialized its domestic economy. Britain is now standing between the two and has the opportunity to move towards a socialized economy, which we need." Ms. Wilkinson also said the same thing in her speech in Parliament when discussing the United Nations Charter. She said: "San Francisco believes that we are... a country between the extremes of two major economic systems." She and Bevin similarly believe that Britain has a special mission to mediate between the United States and the Soviet Union. Britain should promote the cooperation of the United States and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Molotov</p>
<p>Molotov recently summarized important international and domestic situations, which provides people with an understanding of the Soviet Union's direction and has always been closely watched by people. As the Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference is about to be held, all parties are particularly concerned about the Soviet Union's intentions. Mr. Molotov's recent speech should be one of the most important reference documents, and the Associated Press's report on Mr. Molotov's speech is translated below:</p>
<p>The Soviet Union Should Consolidate Cooperation in Victory</p>
<p>Molotov said: "We hope that our country will flourish and have atomic energy, as well as many other things. Today, it is impossible for great secrets to be kept by a small circle composed of one or a few countries..." Therefore, the discovery of atomic energy should not be used as a display of force in international policy, nor should we be complacent about the future of peace-loving countries.</p>
<p>He said that the great destructive power of the atomic bomb has not yet been used to prevent aggression or protect peace. He did not mention the United States or any other country when he mentioned atomic energy in his speech.</p>
<p>Molotov demanded compensation from the defeated Axis countries without revenge, and at the same time warned the people that the roots of imperialism in today's world have not been eliminated. "The Allies should do their best to consolidate the cooperation gained in victory."</p>
<p>Molotov suggested that the victorious Allied countries should not treat the defeated Axis countries entirely according to their own feelings, but only according to the need to prevent new aggression.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, Molotov is the only senior Soviet official to talk about atomic energy. He advocated that the Soviet Union must actively pay attention to industry and train advanced technical personnel. "We must acquire the achievements of modern world technology in all aspects of industry and the national economy, and make the conditions for Soviet science and technology to play the greatest role."</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Returning the Military to the Nation, Returning Power to the People</h3>
<p>Chongqing (Central News Agency): National Assembly representatives yesterday issued a joint opinion on the current situation on National Renaissance Day, stating that the solution to the current national crisis lies in two points: returning the military to the nation and returning power to the people. Although we have not yet read the full text of their opinion, judging from the gist of this telegram, it already outweighs tens of thousands of words of political commentary.</p>
<p>The army should be organized by the nation, and political power originally belongs to the people. The Republic was established, and the Lunar New Year's Eve of the 34th year is approaching, yet we still need to return the military to the nation and return power to the people. The government and the people should truly feel ashamed and blame themselves. How can we allow old stories to obstruct progress and continue to hesitate? Currently, there is a high call for the government to convene a Political Consultative Conference. Representatives of various parties, including the Communist Party, as well as so-called social elites, are all gathered in the temporary capital, engaging in frequent social interactions, filled with joy. It seems that the Chinese political situation is very optimistic. Standing from the perspective of the people, we sincerely hope that this bright atmosphere will not be like the fleeting ephemera of previous negotiations between the government and the Communist Party, quickly covered by dark clouds again. Therefore, we feel that the opinions of the National Assembly representatives are indeed worth careful consideration. Whether it is the government or various parties, if they do not thoroughly realize this and unanimously move towards the broad path of "returning the military" and "returning power," China's political situation may never embark on the track of democracy and the rule of law.</p>
<p>Special Envoy Marshall has come to China, and all parties have placed deep hopes on how he will promote China's internal unity. However, he is quite humble, saying either that he does not know much about China or that his primary purpose here is to listen to opinions from all sides. It is evident that determining how to handle China's internal affairs in the most reasonable and legal way is not something that can be answered in a moment. It is better to seek solutions from ourselves rather than rely entirely on allied nations and place our hopes on foreigners. In fact, the Chinese people understand and are the fairest judges of Chinese affairs. Therefore, solving China's national problems, while difficult, is also quite easy. As long as all parties can respect the opinions of the people and listen to their judgments, no one can deceive anyone, and no one can intimidate anyone. Temporarily gathering a group of people, writing a few letters, claiming to be representatives, and boasting as public opinion might fool foreigners, but it will not necessarily deceive the people! Today, the people have very simple and reasonable standards for commenting on national affairs. Whoever can immediately return the military to the nation, truly subject to the command of the nation's supreme commander, and no longer be an enemy of the people, engaging in actions detrimental to the people, will earn the praise of the people. Whoever can return political power to the people—the true masters—sooner rather than later, implement constitutional governance in which the people have rights and the government has ability, and no longer rely on any party to obstruct the convening of the National Assembly, will earn the support of the people. Therefore, the two proposed solutions to the national crisis provided by the National Assembly representatives, "returning the military to the nation" and "returning power to the people," are indeed the common opinions of the majority of the people. The National Assembly representatives are truly worthy of being representatives of the people for being able to express this concisely and directly.</p>
<p>Currently, what everyone is most worried about is: whether China will split and whether it will evolve into a situation of separate regimes seeking only partial peace. Looking at the current international environment: the United States has publicly recognized the National Government led by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek as the only legitimate government of China, continues to support it, and believes that maintaining a strong and unified China is an important factor for world peace; the Soviet Union not only shares this sentiment with the United States, but the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance also has clear provisions to this effect; and as for other allied nations such as Britain and France, even if there are some imperialist colonial officials, as condemned by General Hurley, attempting to obstruct China's unity, their governments and far-sighted politicians all hope that China will become a strong, unified, and democratic country. Thus, it is the common desire of major allied nations that China should be unified and not allowed to have further division and separation. Looking at the domestic situation: the National Government has long advocated stopping armed conflicts, convening a consultative conference, and peacefully discussing solutions to the national crisis. Fortunately, the Communist Party has recently sent representatives to the temporary capital, and other parties are also preparing to participate in the discussions. If everyone has sincerity, no one will suspect that there are still people who intend to play the game of armed separation. In theory, China's unification should not be a problem. However, as General Hurley said, "The existence of armed political parties and independent armies in China makes China's political unity impossible." Therefore, if we want China to truly become a unified and strong country, we must first meet the basic condition of returning all armies to the nation. Otherwise, despite verbally saying "ceasefire" and submitting "ceasefire proposals" in writing, attacks and battles can still occur every day. Just by flipping through yesterday's and today's newspapers, we can see eye-catching news such as the Communist army attacking the northwest suburbs of Tianjin, the Communist army harassing Liangxiang, the Communist army in northern Jiangsu destroying postal institutions, and the Communist army in Dingxian demanding grain and conscripting soldiers... From this, we can see that if the return of the military to the nation is not done immediately, the Chinese people will not have a peaceful night's sleep. Moreover, the result of political parties engaging in military activities can lead to separation and division, or even invite foreign aggression, brewing wars, and plunging China back into a state of utter destruction!</p>
<p>Secondly, what everyone is paying attention to is: how will China create a democratic country? In fact, this is not difficult either. In various countries, the forms of democratic systems may be different, but the spirit of democratic systems is the same. This spirit is nothing more than that the political system of a country is determined by the people of that country themselves. Therefore, sovereignty in China rests with the Chinese people. The people have the right to elect and the right to recall, so they can elect which party and recall which individuals. The people have the right to initiate and the right to referendum, so they can initiate which laws and reject which regulations. No one, no party, can deny or seize this political power of the people, and no foreign country can influence it. Although we hope that the Political Consultative Conference can give various parties an opportunity to discuss with an open mind and work together harmoniously, the government should not and cannot grant this conference, which has no legal basis and is not elected by the people, a special privilege to represent our people in resolving all national affairs. Therefore, China will either not embark on the path of democracy, or if it wants to have a democratic China, the only proper path is to hope that the government will move from "tutelage" to "constitutionalism" as soon as possible. This step from "tutelage" to "constitutionalism" is also what President Truman expects from the National Government: "revising the period of political tutelage." How to revise it? How to move towards constitutionalism? Other than convening the National Assembly on schedule in accordance with the law so that the National Assembly can be seen convening in the capital in May 5th of next year to formulate a constitution, which the whole country will follow, there is no other shortcut. Chinese people often seek convenience and like to take shortcuts; in fact, democratic politics is a politics that has been nurtured and grown in Europe and America for hundreds of years, and there is no convenient shortcut to take. If we want to learn democracy and truly become a democratic country, we can only do it diligently, seriously, and without delaying the convening of the National Assembly and the formulation of the fundamental law of the country for any reason. Furthermore, the preparations for the National Assembly to convene and formulate the constitution on schedule must not be delayed due to the convening of the Political Consultative Conference. As for the Political Consultative Conference, it must be open so that our people know what they are discussing, which is a matter of course and does not need to be discussed in depth. Only in this way can the government show its sincerity in returning power to the people. Talking about anything else without this is just trimming the branches, which will only make things more chaotic and will not clarify the Chinese political situation.</p>
<h3>Snapshots of the Guangzhou Gas Factory: From Takeover to Resumption of Production</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Liang Feng</p>
<p>Even the name "Guangzhou Gas Factory" is unfamiliar to Guangzhou people. What exactly does this factory produce? What kind of gas does it refine? The outside world does not know. They did not expect that the inexhaustible air, in addition to sustaining the survival of all living things in the universe, also has great uses. The carbon and oxygen contained in the air can both be utilized. However, this gas factory currently mainly produces compressed oxygen, which is also very useful. It is needed for welding, mines, machine factories, submarines, hospitals, etc., and can also be used as other chemical raw materials. Therefore, during the nation-building period, it is of great help to national defense or economic construction.</p>
<p>In order to understand the organization and manufacturing process of the factory, the reporter made a special visit. It turned out that it was established by the enemy after the fall of Guangzhou, originally called "Toa Teikoku Compression Gas Co., Ltd., Guangdong Branch." After the Japanese surrender, the Ministry of Economic Affairs sent a special commissioner in September of this year to take over, and it was renamed "Guangzhou Gas Factory."</p>
<p>Since Mr. Wu Chaozhu took over as director of the factory, and Engineer Wu Yaorong concurrently served as chief of the Engineering Department, all Japanese personnel were dismissed. After more than two months of reorganization and preparation, the factory officially resumed production on December 9th, making it the first factory to resume production among the factories taken over by our authorities in Guangdong.</p>
<p>Walking into the factory building, the scale is not very large, a T-shaped room about three zhang long. The first thing that catches the eye is an oxygen storage tower with a capacity of eight cubic meters at the edge of the building. Looking up, there is a white iron pipe erected in the upper right corner, which is the air inlet. Walking into the inner room, there are two steel water towers about seven or eight chi high and one and a half chi in diameter, filled with sodium hydroxide solution (caustic soda liquid preparation). The air is sucked in from the air and passes through these two sodium hydroxide water towers, absorbing carbon dioxide gas. The air then flows into the compressor, which compresses the air to a pressure of 200 atmospheres. It then enters a dryer to absorb the moisture in the air. It is then introduced into a high-pressure sodium hydroxide cylinder to wash the air again. After that, it passes through a cold water tank to cool it down before being introduced into the separator. Under normal temperature and high compression, the air is compressed and separated. After six hours of liquefaction, seventy-nine parts of nitrogen rise and are discharged, and the remaining twenty-one parts of oxygen sink and enter the storage tower. After the tower contains six cubic feet of oxygen, the gas is introduced into a high-pressure machine for recompression, with a pressure reaching 150 atmospheres, which is equivalent to 150 kilograms of pure oxygen. Finally, it is introduced into a water separator to separate any remaining gas before being filled into iron cylinders of three capacities: five cubic meters, six cubic meters, and seven cubic meters. This is the finished product of oxygen. The shape of the iron cylinder is quite like a two- or three-hundred-pound bomb. The power of oxygen is very great. If it leaks out from a small hole, and you bring a match close to it, the match will ignite before you even get near the small hole.</p>
<p>Currently, the factory's oxygen production is 90 cubic meters per day. Because of the limited power supply from the power plant, it is impossible to start work during the day, and it can only be manufactured at night, so the output is not much. Based on the current production costs, excluding the fact that the air does not need to be purchased, the rest requires 10 pounds of sodium hydroxide, 5 pounds of cleaning oil, 10 pounds of asbestos, 450 degrees of electricity, and 30 technicians. Currently, because the factory has just resumed operations, it has not been able to fully utilize the nitrogen discharged from the separator (nitrogen can be used to make ammonia). If the power plant extends the power supply time, then the factory's output can be increased to meet the needs of the city's agencies and factories.</p>
<p>According to Director Wu, there is a similar gas factory in Chongqing, which is run by the Resources Committee, and its scale is not as large as this one. In addition, there is one in Guiyang, which is run by the Aviation Committee, and the output is unknown. He also said: What is currently worth reporting is that, in addition to the fact that our factory is the first factory taken over by the Ministry of Economic Affairs to resume production, we have not used any funds from the Ministry of Economic Affairs from the takeover to the resumption of production, and we already have a considerable surplus. (December 16, Guangzhou).</p>

<h3>Cloth Produced by State-Run Factories: City Urgently Awaiting Purchase; Speculation about Dumping Enemy and Puppet Cloth Not Confirmed by Competent Authorities</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] Recently, the price of grey cloth has risen on the market. There are rumors that the authorities will dump more than 10 million bolts of cotton cloth seized from the enemy and puppets. However, according to Mr. Pan, a member of the Reorganization Committee of the Dyeing and Weaving Factory and the Cotton Cloth Merchants' Association, this has not been confirmed by the competent authorities. Moreover, according to what our association and others know, the state-run textile mills have been operating for more than 20 days, producing approximately 4,000 bolts per day, so the stock should be around 1 million bolts. As for the cloth seized from enemy and puppet organizations, there are more than 3 million bolts delivered by the Puppet Chamber of Commerce, one-third of which is grey cloth and two-thirds of which is processed colored cloth. This cloth was forcibly collected from our association's member factories and firms by the enemy and puppet governments through illegal means. We are currently petitioning the government to thoroughly investigate and return it, so there is no reason to dump it immediately. The cloth produced by state-run factories is urgently awaited for purchase on the market. The government may be able to sell it in advance, but whether this can be implemented before the Textile Construction Company takes over remains to be confirmed.</p>
<h3>Domestically Produced Goods Shipped to the United States: Two Batches Recently</h3>
<p>Sino-American trade has now begun. Imports from the United States include foreign wine, canned milk and other food, and White Tower Oil and other food products. The largest items are gasoline, kerosene, diesel, and other oils from Mobil and Texaco. The wheat, flour, cotton fabrics, and wool that arrived in Shanghai previously were all relief supplies, and commercial goods have not yet been imported. Most import and export merchants do not dare to trade fully because foreign exchange has not yet been regulated. A small number of export goods have already been shipped to the United States. The first batch was shipped out on the American ship Grand on the 13th of this month, including tung oil, lake silk, straw hats, and other miscellaneous goods. The second batch was shipped to Vancouver and New York by the British Far East Shipping Management Office's Java Prince last Saturday, and then transferred to the American interior, including 153 boxes of lake silk, 117 boxes of Shandong pongee, and 158 pieces of pig bristles. There were also 5,570 pieces of old clothes and old shoes from the Relief Agency shipped to Hong Kong.</p>

<h3>Coal Prices in This City in the Last Six Months</h3>
<p>— Xue Peng</p>
<p>Coal is broadly divided into two types: bituminous and anthracite. Anthracite is used for fuel, while bituminous coal is used by factories and ships for power. Currently, most of the anthracite sold on the market is Yangquan lump, Jiaozuo lump, and Yangquan fines. Bituminous coal is mostly Dazhashan fines and Dazhashan lump, followed by Huainan lump.</p>
<p>After the September 18th Incident in 1931, when the Northeast fell, the enemy seized coal from Fushun and Benxi Lake and aggressively promoted it to various places. At that time, according to coal industry statistics, Shanghai needed 5 million tons of coal annually, but 80% was enemy coal. Therefore, this period can be called the enemy coal dumping period. In 1933, the state-run coal industry specially formed the National Coal Relief Committee, stepped up coal mining in various places, worked hard to expand shipping, and levied special taxes to try to resist it. Coal from Datong, Daxing, Kailuan, Hanyeping, and Changxing came continuously. During this period, it can be called the period of national coal rising. Until the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, coal mines on all roads were successively occupied by the enemy. The enemy then reorganized the Coal Association to strictly control it. When the Pacific War broke out, the source of foreign coal was cut off, and coal use in this city relied entirely on existing stocks. This period can be called the coal industry panic period. When the enemy was defeated and the earth returned to spring, factories and vehicles resumed operations one after another, and the demand for coal increased day by day. However, because transportation tools were not yet sufficient and transportation had not returned to its original state, and Kailuan, Fushun, Benxi Lake, and other places were disturbed by bandits and order had not been restored, although the government did its best to transport coal from Qinhuangdao and other places to Shanghai, it was still too little for too many, barely enough for public use. Even less anthracite arrived. Therefore, although other commodity prices have been declining recently, coal prices have remained unchanged. The following is a list of coal price fluctuations in the last six months:</p>
<p>(Note 1) The above is calculated in puppet currency.</p>
<p>(Note 2) The above is calculated in legal tender.</p>
<p>According to the coal prices listed in the above table, the period from August 15th to September 1st saw the most severe price drop. One reason was that after the sun was restored and people generally believed that coal transportation could be smooth from then on, hoarders emerged and buyers waited and watched. However, the biggest reason was that the enemy took advantage of the inconsistent pace of the government's takeover work to secretly sell the coal that had been controlled and plundered over the years. Now the government has established a Fuel Committee to coordinate mining and sales for fuel. Kailuan Coal Mine is actively mining, and the Qinhuangdao shipping route has been opened. The takeover work in the nine eastern provinces is proceeding smoothly. Coal from Fushun and Benxi Lake can continue to be mined, and the takeover of enemy coal has also been opened. With these sources coming later, coal prices may gradually be leveled out.</p>
<h3>The Coal Shortage Remains Difficult to Resolve, Few Coal Businesses Have Resumed Operations</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] Coal prices have recently shown signs of stabilizing, but because the base price was already high, it remains an essential commodity that is both scarce and expensive.  For example, the common bituminous coal dust used by factories still costs more than 100,000 yuan per ton, a difference that is immeasurable compared to the pre-war price of only ten to twelve yuan. Even compared to this summer, when the price consistently hovered between 100,000 and 200,000 yuan in puppet currency, the rate of increase has not returned to its original state.  At this time of rebuilding and revitalizing industry, it remains a problem worthy of anxiety. Before the victory, the enemy puppet government had already felt a severe shortage of coal for several months.  When the light of day returned, the enemy puppet government had naturally surrendered, but the stagnation of supply extended for another month or two.  With the assistance of the Allied forces in facilitating the government's efforts and the Fuel Committee's strenuous attempts to find solutions, batches of accumulated coal were gradually transported from Lianyungang, Qinhuangdao, and other places to Shanghai, totaling approximately 80,000 tons.  The Fuel Committee allocated this to public utilities and state-owned factories.  Among these, the power company needed about 1,000 tons per day.  Although some state-owned factories received coal as a foundation, coal is a consumable fuel, and its consumption is rapid, so it was not long before it was exhausted.  It is said that the amount they received from the Fuel Committee was still insufficient.  The low operating rate of textile factories after their takeover indicates that a lack of fuel is one of the main reasons. As for private industries, the situation is even more dire. During the enemy puppet period, there was a so-called "Greater Central United Association" that provided some allocations as a perfunctory policy, but the amount was small and the duration was short. Except for those with special backgrounds, they almost always relied on "private goods" to operate.  At that time, the puppet government repeatedly conducted registration and investigation of coal reserves, and cracked down on hoarding. The severity of transporting coal on the streets was second only to that of transporting military supplies. The puppet economic security team used this as an opportunity to extort and exploit in every possible way, so the coal reserves in Shanghai had long been completely depleted. Since the arrival of victory, the crackdown has naturally been lifted, but due to poor connections and insufficient transportation, the amount of coal that merchants transported themselves was sporadic and insufficient to be statistically significant. As a result, factories have no good solution for coal use except to scrape together the small amounts left in various places.  Currently, a large quantity of American diesel fuel is expected to arrive, which can be used as a substitute for coal, thus reducing the severity of the coal shortage. However, it is uneconomical for our country, which could originally have a surplus of coal, to need to purchase imported fuel.  Investigations show that the coal sources for Shanghai have historically been the Kailuan, Huainan, Yangquan, and Datong mines. Currently, Kailuan has resumed production and is shipping about 4,000 tons per day.  Huainan has partially resumed operations and was able to produce 2,000 tons per day before the war. It is said that it will soon be fully operational.  While Kailuan ships a larger quantity, transportation is often hindered, making it difficult to receive.  Huainan is easier to receive, and merchants have been going there to purchase and transport coal in recent months, but the amount is small and the quality is lower.  As for the Yangquan and Datong mines in Shanxi, one produces anthracite and the other produces bituminous coal.  Before the war, they had large-scale production, but now they are completely shut down.  Even if there are coal reserves there, political instability makes it impossible to transport them to Shanghai.  Currently, the source of coal in Shanghai still depends on the government's facilitation. Since Xie, a prominent figure in the coal industry, returned from the rear, he has been facilitating coal transportation with a self-reliant attitude.  A batch has already been transported from Huainan this month. Originally, there were more than 1,000 coal businesses in Shanghai. Although not many have formally closed down, the number of those open but without goods is numerous. Among the more prominent ones, the North China Coal Company was originally the leading distributor for various mines in North China.  It closed down when the enemy occupied the concessions and has remained closed ever since.  Many of its employees are living on meager sustenance.  Yuan Tai also closed down at the same time and has not yet resumed operations. It is said that Da Chang and Yi Tai Xing were previously associated with the "Greater Central United Association," and have therefore also not resumed operations. Secondary coal businesses, such as Yong Cheng, Zheng Da, Min Sheng, and Jin Chang, have returned to the market, but without reliable sources of goods or stable prices, they lack vitality.  Shanghai was originally an industrial center.  We can observe the rise and fall of the coal industry to gauge the extent of factory resumption.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Gas Company Announces: Status of Gas Supply, Monthly Production of 80 Million Cubic Feet</h3>
<p>Gas should be the most affordable fuel in this city. According to Shanghai Gas Company personnel, the gas production in the city has been 70 million cubic feet per month in the summer, and can increase by 10 million cubic feet in the winter. The monthly coal consumption is about 3,000 to 4,000 tons.  Each ton of raw coal can produce eight to ten gallons of crude tar oil after being gasified. The byproduct is coke, which has recently reached 2,000 to 3,000 tons per month. The company was occupied by the enemy for several years, and all byproducts were used for military purposes. After reorganization, it has not yet been able to return to its original state. The price of gas per degree was 9.5 yuan in August, 14.5 yuan from September to November, and 100 yuan in December. Exceeding the limit, residents are fined 800 yuan per degree, and businesses are fined 1,500 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cotton Mills Order American Cotton</h3>

The deadline for delivery is January of next year. The cost of freight, handling, and insurance is included, amounting to about 50,000 yuan. This translates to 72,000 yuan at the Greater Shanghai market price.</p>

<h3>Foreign Merchants Are No Longer Allowed to Handle Land Registration and Certification</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] Due to the concession system in Shanghai, when foreigners purchased or leased land, in addition to the perpetual lease or "Tao Deed" issued by the Chinese government, they also registered with their consulates. The purpose of this procedure by the consulates was to collect property taxes from their nationals in Shanghai, the so-called land tax. Because of treaty relations, China could not collect any land taxes or other land taxes from them. As a result, many land merchants competed to transfer land to foreigners, who would pay for the title deeds as proof. After obtaining these certificates, they would no longer go through the procedures of transfer registration or tax collection with the Chinese government, and would evade all taxes and fees. Therefore, some foreign merchants specialized in this business, resulting in the abnormal phenomena of so-called "registration," "large transfers," and "small transfers." Now that the concessions have been recovered, the Land Administration Bureau has formulated measures for handling the registration of land with perpetual leases or Tao Deeds, stipulating that foreigners leasing land with perpetual leases or Tao Deeds must register the lease, and if the land belongs to Chinese, they must register the ownership. Foreign merchants who handled registration in the past no longer have the right to register transfers or issue land rights. Recently, fourteen companies, including British-owned Arnhold &amp; Co., Tong Ho Yang Hsiang, Belgian-owned Banque Belge Pour L'Etranger, and American-owned China Trading Company, jointly published advertisements announcing the resumption of such business. The Land Administration Bureau considers this illegal and has requested the municipal government to instruct the Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Shanghai to notify the consulates concerned to correct this. At the same time, the Social Bureau has instructed the foreign companies to stop this illegal business in order to protect national laws and tax revenue.</p>

<h3>Pre-Preparatory Class of Provisional University Holds Entrance Examination</h3>
<p>Held Simultaneously in Shanghai and Yangzhou</p>
<p>[From our local correspondent] There has been a very enthusiastic response to the registration for students in the pre-preparatory class attached to the Provisional University Preparatory Class. It is said that more than 1,500 people have registered in Shanghai, and nearly 1,000 have registered at the Yangzhou registration office. Because there were too many applicants, the school building was not enough, and the students' documents were difficult to verify temporarily because the original school no longer existed. It was necessary to hold an entrance examination for screening. Recently, the Ministry of Education also advocated for an examination first. Therefore, the school decided to hold examinations at the Shanghai Jiaotong University in Xujiahui and the Yangzhou Imperial Palace Nantong Middle School on January 22nd and 23rd of the 35th year [1946]. The subjects of the examination are civics, Chinese, English, mathematics, and general knowledge. Most of the examiners are well-known university professors, and all procedures are very serious.</p>

Because the repair of the campus has not yet been completed, it will take another week to complete the project. Therefore, the start date has been postponed to January 10th of the 35th year [1946].

<p>New Civic Training</p>
<p>Roosevelt High School in San Francisco, USA, stipulates that children in their teens participate in a "Mock World Peace Conference" as part of their social studies homework for students in a modern democratic country. Their interest was aroused by recent events. Because the United Nations Conference on International Organizations was held in San Francisco in the spring of 1945, these students developed a strong interest in international issues. They formed their own "Mock World Peace Conference," with fifty students playing the roles of fifty United Nations representatives. This has extremely valuable significance for their future activities as citizens. (Three photos attached) First photo: (At the opening of the Mock World Peace Conference, a female "representative" puts the day's agenda on the blackboard, handing it over to the "representatives" of the fifty United Nations students for joint discussion. Second photo: A student, playing the role of the "British representative" at this mock World Peace Conference, with a small model of a city destroyed by war in front of him, and a model of a rebuilt house next to him, expresses his opinion, stating that post-war reconstruction is an urgent need.

<h3>Handling Enemy and Puppet Assets; The Reverse Assets Group Actively Investigates; Court to Decide if Seizure is Mistaken</h3>
<p>After the victory of the War of Resistance, the seizure of reverse assets in Shanghai was chaotic due to the lack of detailed planning in advance, and there were many complaints from all sides. Later, the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Third Front Army, the Shanghai Municipal Party Department, the Shanghai Branch of the Youth League, and other units organized the Shanghai Reverse Assets Clearing Committee to unify the city's reverse assets seizure work and be responsible for the custody and clearing. Subsequently, the Shanghai District Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau was established. According to the order of the Executive Yuan, all enemy and reverse assets in the district were to be handled by the bureau. On the tenth of this month, the bureau established a Reverse Assets Group, which is specifically responsible for handling reverse assets matters.</p>
<p>Seized Reverse Assets Taken Over Separately</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the group, the group is now taking over all unfinished matters of the Shanghai Reverse Assets Clearing Committee and continuing to carry out the reverse assets investigation in the district, and encouraging confidential reports, in order to ensure that the property of all puppet personnel cannot be enjoyed by the reverse puppets and can be used appropriately. The reverse assets are mostly real estate, furniture, coins, securities, and precious jewelry. Real estate and furniture will be taken over by the group in conjunction with the Central Trust Bureau and immediately allocated to the Central Trust Bureau for custody and use. Coins, securities, and precious jewelry will be taken over by the group in conjunction with the Central Bank and immediately allocated to the Central Bank for custody and use. The group itself does not take over the physical objects of reverse assets, but is responsible for the investigation, registration, and statistics of reverse assets, and allocates them to various statutory institutions for taking over and use according to their different properties. As for the reverse assets that have been seized, if there are disputes, and the parties concerned provide evidence, pointing out that there may have been errors at the time of seizure, then the case will be transferred to the court for investigation and adjudicated by the court. The person in charge also stated that the personnel sent out by the group to investigate reverse assets all have badges and investigator identification cards, and it is hoped that people from all walks of life will pay attention and not be used by thugs to commit various illegal acts under false pretenses.</p>

Liang Xiaochu, Secretary-General of the World Association of Young Men's Christian Associations, and Luo Kedian, member of the Japanese Cultural Work Committee of the Central Propaganda Department, delivered important speeches.

<h3>Municipal Government Spring Cleaning</h3>
<p>(This newspaper report) The offices in the Municipal Government will be readjusted and distributed, and must be completed before the 28th of this month. A spring cleaning will be held, and inspections will be carried out at 2:00 PM on the 31st.</p>
<h3>Entertainment Tax for Public Venues; Allied Forces Still Subject to Tax</h3>
<p>(This newspaper report) The Municipal Finance Bureau stipulates that all bars, restaurants, and entertainment venues self-established by the Allied forces, and venues attached to hotels that are exclusively for the reception of the Allied forces, or places where personnel designated by the Allied forces enter and exit, are exempt from tax. As for other commercial public restaurants or entertainment venues, taxes will be levied as usual.</p>
<p>Regarding the US military, they recently requested the Municipal Government to allow them to be exempt from tax in public venues. It is reported that the Municipal Government cannot agree to this, because food and entertainment taxes are stipulated by the Finance Bureau and implemented uniformly throughout the country. Changing or exempting tax amounts is not something that this city can decide.</p>
<h3>Li Shiyong and Others Request Severe Punishment for Enemy Military Police</h3>
<p>More than ten members of the Chinese Kuomintang Party, including Li Shiyong, Zhu Wen, Qian Jianqiu, Zhuang Hecheng, and Zeng Hou, were ordered to stay in Shanghai during the War of Resistance to carry out underground work, and were arrested by the Enemy Military Police's Shanghai Southern Detachment several times. They were subjected to various tortures. Especially Zhang Yongchun and Du Tianwen, two comrades, died of injuries not long after they were released from prison, which is truly sad and indignant. They have jointly submitted a request to the authorities to interrogate the main culprits of the Enemy Military Police, such as Kawagoe Kawano and other nine criminals, and sentence them to death to warn others. A public trial is scheduled to take place, and they hope that comrades who have been victimized over the years will come to court to testify to avoid evasion.</p>
<h3>Daxin Company Opens Dance Hall to Entertain Allied and National Forces</h3>
<p>During the War of Resistance, the Battlefield Service Corps of the Military Affairs Commission took serving the Allied and National Forces as its mission. Its affiliated Air Force Reception Centers were distributed in various air force bases across the country, responsible for the reception of the Allied and Chinese Air Force's food, clothing, shelter, and transportation, and promoted noble entertainment to promote the Allied and National Forces' jubilation. The Shanghai Office of the Corps believes that there are no suitable noble entertainment venues for the Allied and National Forces in this city, so it has borrowed the Dance Addiction on the fifth floor of the Daxin Company, which is a venue dedicated to entertaining the Allied and National Forces.</p>
<h3>Central Committee Member Jiang Bocheng Awarded First-Class Certificate from the Central Government</h3>
<p>Jiang Bocheng, a current Central Committee member and Zhejiang Inspector, was ordered to come to Shanghai in 1939 to lead Shanghai party and government personnel in a desperate struggle against the enemy puppets. He experienced many hardships and made outstanding achievements. He was arrested once two years ago, but remained steadfast. The Central Executive Committee recently awarded Mr. Jiang with Certificate No. 1 for Merit. The original text reads: "When the Japanese invaded, the people suffered. Our Party led the military and civilians to resist the enemy's atrocities. After eight years of righteous war, we completed our territory. Commemorating the merits of the generals, we should show our gratitude. After investigation, Comrade Jiang Bocheng fought behind enemy lines, and experienced many dangers. He was loyal, brave, talented, and hardworking. He is awarded a certificate to honor his achievements and encourage future generations. This certificate. President Chiang Kai-shek."</p>
<h3>Mayor Qian Broadcast Last Night: The Meaning of the New Life</h3>
<p>Mayor Qian Dajun of Shanghai City broadcast to the citizens of the city at 6:30 PM yesterday (the 25th). The topic was "The Meaning of the New Life Movement." The original text stated: The Shanghai Municipal Government, in order to follow President Chiang's instructions to implement the New Life, especially, in accordance with the central government's regulations, joined the party, government, military organs, and social figures of this city to form a "New Life Movement Promotion Association," with myself as the director. He is preparing to implement the New Life Movement effectively and universally in Shanghai. This movement has now begun. Therefore, I am broadcasting to the compatriots from all walks of life in this city today to explain the meaning of the New Life Movement and attract everyone's attention.</p>
<p>Changing the Atmosphere</p>
<p>The New Life Movement is a movement to "change the atmosphere." During the three-plus months that I have been in Shanghai, I have repeatedly spoken about the importance of changing the atmosphere. I have cited two major categories of construction, explaining that the importance of spiritual construction surpasses material construction. The meaning of spiritual construction is not much different from the so-called changing the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Now we must ask what kind of era we are in, and what kind of atmosphere is needed to suit it? Everyone knows that we are now in a great era of national construction. Looking around the world, we can see that we are inferior to others in many aspects today. Whether it is in the economy, military, politics, or science education, we are far behind others. We must work hard to catch up. This awareness, of course, does not start today. Now our country has been unified, the strong enemy has been defeated, and the friendship between the Allied countries is increasing, and international cooperation is growing. This situation is the golden age for us to work hard to build the country. The greatness of our goals, the breadth of our scope, and the arduousness of our work are naturally obvious. To complete the task, we must have a good atmosphere that adapts to this requirement. If the thoughts, behaviors, and living habits of the people of the whole country can adapt to this requirement, then the completion of our national construction will definitely be twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<p>Eliminating Morbidity</p>
<p>It pointed out the new path that the people should follow. This new path is to "promote a regulated life of etiquette, righteousness, integrity, and shame, and practice the virtues of etiquette, righteousness, integrity, and shame in daily life - in the four things of clothing, food, shelter, and transportation." Therefore, President Chiang instructed us to "understand etiquette, righteousness, integrity, and shame, be responsible, and obey discipline." For our general life, he also gave six major principles, which are "neatness, cleanliness, simplicity, frugality, speed, and certainty." At the same time, he requires three "izations" in life, which are "militarization," "productionization," and "rationalization." These are the most important principles of the New Life Movement. I hope that the people of the whole country can remember them, examine them, and implement them. If the people of the whole country can do it, I think we should first promote four movements in Shanghai now.</p>
<p>Four Movements</p>
<p>First: is to vigorously implement cleaning and hygiene. Shanghai is really not clean enough now, which is not only harmful to health, but also harmful to the appearance. We have already held a cleaning week once, and now we are holding a major cleaning. We must continue to work hard.</p>
<p>Second: is to abide by rules and order. Shanghai has a large population and traffic congestion. Especially from January 1 next year, all horses will have to drive on the right. Special attention should be paid to traffic rules. At the same time, we also ask the citizens of the city to abide by order, whether it is getting on the train at the station, buying tickets at the theater, or in other public places, they must follow the order and not scramble.</p>
<p>Third: is to promote simplicity and frugality. Shanghai is a commercial port, and citizens are accustomed to extravagance and complexity. This custom is not only easy to lead to evil, but also wasteful of resources. From now on, we should correct the prevailing customs and promote simplicity and frugality. In clothing, food, shelter, and transportation, we must be frugal. All weddings, funerals, celebrations, social gatherings, and gifts must follow the principles of simplicity and frugality. During the national construction period, we must especially save resources to meet the needs of construction.</p>
<p>Fourth: is to promote healthy entertainment. In the past, the lives of many citizens in Shanghai were too decadent and corrupt, so that smoking and gambling were rampant throughout the city. Everyone rushed to it, weakening the people's physique and creating a national decline. In addition to strictly banning these bad entertainments, we must also promote healthy entertainment to replace them. For example, engaging in sports, recreational parks, and reading books are all healthy entertainments that benefit the body and mind. We must do our best to find ways for citizens to increase equipment and convenience. At the same time, we require citizens of the city to abandon bad habits, develop new habits, and actively participate in and engage in this kind of healthy entertainment.</p>
<p>The above is only a part of the work to be promoted in the New Life Movement. We are prepared to promote them first, and then the rest. What I hope everyone pays attention to is first, to recognize the importance of the New Life Movement, and second, to know that the New Life Movement is a social movement, and the tasks of implementation and publicity also require the self-awareness and automation of the citizens of the whole city. At the same time, we must also widely persuade relatives and friends to implement it, encourage each other, and supervise each other. In this way, one person transmits to ten, and ten people transmit to one hundred. The New Life Movement can be effectively and universally promoted in Shanghai. Although there are many conditions for creating a new Shanghai, the main condition is that the citizens of Shanghai can implement the New Life. The implementation of the New Life is a necessary foundation for the construction of the new China and a reliable guarantee for the success of the new China. I hope that all citizens will earnestly implement it and strive to persuade them to complete this important mission.</p>
<h3>The First Verdict by the District Court: Ticket Scalpers Detained</h3>
<p>(This newspaper report) The ticket scalpers, known for disrupting the order of ticket purchases for train passengers, were rampant before the victory, and normal travelers suffered from it. Since the Ministry of Transportation took over the "Central China Railway Company," it has spared no effort in cracking down on ticket scalpers. In October of this year, the Railway Police Department was established, and it began to arrest ticket scalpers on a large scale. It sent out many plainclothes detectives, disguised as passengers, and took the opportunity to arrest them. In the early part of last month, it successively detained a group of party members, including Wang Xiaolin, Gao Hongquan, Li Longwen, Chen Caiyuan, and other fourteen people (including four women), and sent them to the District Court. After questioning, a verdict was rendered at 10:00 AM yesterday, the train tickets were confiscated, and the detention period ranged from 25 to 50 days, and no bail was allowed. According to this case, this is the first verdict against ticket scalpers in this city. It is said that the Railway Police Department of the North Station has many more ticket scalpers in custody, who have not yet been sent to the court.</p>
<h3>Regulations on the Display of Flags by Foreign Nationals; Chinese and Foreign National Flags to be Displayed Simultaneously</h3>
<p>(This newspaper report) Regarding the regulations on the display of foreign national flags, the Municipal Government has now received a message from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which has been forwarded to the consuls of various countries stationed in Shanghai for their information. The methods are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>According to international practice, the government agencies of various foreign countries may display their own national flags every day, but foreign residents, shops, and ordinary agencies are only allowed to display national flags on their national day or other commemorative days to show their celebration. At the same time, the national flag of the country where they reside must be displayed.</p>
<p>If the national flags of the two countries are hung diagonally, the Chinese national flag should be hung on the right. If the national flags of the two countries are hung up and down, the Chinese national flag should be hung on top.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to international practice, all concessions in this city have now been recovered, and foreign nationals enjoy the right to protection from this Municipal Government. Therefore, they must display the Chinese national flag and their own national flag simultaneously.</p>
<h3>Jùlù Road Robbery Case: Another Bandit Captured</h3>
<p>Confession Ties Him to Yu Yuan Road Robbery</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Yesterday morning's Jùlù Road robbery case, which involved a fierce gun battle between bandits and police on Carter Road, resulted in two bandits being shot dead on the spot, and three male and female bandits being captured alive. Guns were seized and stolen goods recovered. Detailed reports were published in yesterday's newspaper. Now, according to the confession of Yang Genfa (local), one of the bandits captured by the Xin Cheng Police Bureau, there were other accomplices in the case, hiding at No. 11 Chahar Road, Chi Bang Bridge. Consequently, Zhang Rou, the chief of the judicial section, led police to the address and arrested Wang Lizhong, a notorious bandit from Wenzhou, aged forty-two. Wang confessed that on the evening of the 12th of this month, at 7:00 PM, they drove a truck to No. 34, Lane 875, Yu Yuan Road, Shanghai West, the residence of Chen Ningquan's family, and committed the major robbery of a large number of gold bars from the safe. This gang was responsible for that crime as well.</p>
<p>All Members of the Tong Taichang Robbery Gang Apprehended</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] At 9:30 PM on the 30th of last month, Gao Shanjian, a patrol officer from the North Station Police Bureau, led police officers and plainclothes detectives to the intersection of North Zhejiang Road and Hai Ning Road. They spotted Ren Chuanru, who appeared to be in a great hurry and was carrying a large package. They took him to the station for questioning. He claimed that he had stolen it from a passenger at the station. However, upon inspecting the package, the clothes inside were in disarray, so it was determined that he could not have stolen them. While interrogating him, Guo, the owner of the Tong Taichang cigarette and paper shop at No. 114 Huaxing Road, came to the bureau to report a theft. Guo was asked to examine the package closely, and he confirmed that it contained the stolen goods. Ren, knowing he could not deny it, confessed to conspiring with accomplices Zhang Lisheng, Jiang Zhengchao, and others to commit the robbery. Based on his confession, accomplices were successively arrested at their addresses. The case has now been fully investigated, and yesterday, the perpetrators were sent to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for legal punishment.</p>
<h3>Foreign Oil Company Equipment Recovered in Part; 40 Gas Stations Being Restored</h3>
<p>The oil storage depots, small oil tanks, pumps, and other equipment belonging to Mobil, Texaco, Asiatic Petroleum, and other oil companies were dismantled and hidden, or destroyed by the Japanese during the war, resulting in significant losses. Asiatic Petroleum suffered the most, while Texaco's losses were relatively smaller. Currently, apart from the oil storage depots of each company, which can still be used, other equipment such as pumps and small oil tanks, which were hidden by the Japanese, have been largely recovered by our Municipal Administration after extensive searching and returned to the respective companies for reinstallation and use. The remainder is still stored in warehouses, but some of it has been damaged or scattered and is no longer usable.</p>
<p>Small Oil Tanks</p>
<p>To meet the normal needs of the Shanghai market, Mobil and the other two companies are working hard to reinstall small 500- to 1,000-gallon oil tanks and new automatic calculating pumps at their original gas stations to supply gasoline, kerosene, and machine oil. The companies have restored approximately 40 gas stations throughout the city, with Texaco being the first to restore and having the largest number. All types of oil come from places like Texaco, Texas in the United States, and are owned by Mobil and Texaco. Asiatic Petroleum's supply in Shanghai is borrowed from the above two companies, and each company has sent one Chinese and one American staff member to assist with the work at Asiatic Petroleum.</p>
<p>Gas Pumps</p>
<p>The gas pumps currently in use at gas stations in the city are not the latest models, and their number is too small to meet the current demand, let alone the large demand of the future. In light of this, Mobil and Texaco have ordered a large number of pumps and other equipment from the United States to meet the needs. This equipment is expected to arrive in China around January or February of next year, along with a large quantity of various types of oil, which will undoubtedly lead to a more abundant supply of liquid fuel in the market.</p>
<h3>Gambling Bust in Caojiadu: One Fatality from Gunshot Wound</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] At No. 49 Kangfu Lane, Extraordinarily Beautiful Road Branch, Caojiadu, Shanghai West, there is a gambling den with gambling equipment such as shaking stands, dominoes, and roulette wheels, operating on a large scale, so gamblers in the vicinity flock to it in droves. Yesterday night at approximately 10:00 PM, the Changning Police Bureau received a report and dispatched more than ten police officers in police vehicles to the address. They forced their way in and arrested thirty to forty gamblers, along with the gambling equipment, and put them all on the police vehicles. However, one gambler, named Xu Aru, jumped out of the vehicle in an attempt to escape. Officer Xu Xianzong spotted him and fired a shot, hitting him in the right arm and penetrating his lower abdomen. He collapsed to the ground, his condition extremely grave. He was taken to Tongren Second Hospital for treatment, but to no avail, and he died soon after.</p>
<h3>Relief for Unemployed Workers: Flour Distribution to Begin Next Month; Adult Workers Receive 1.5 Bags per Month, Child Workers One Bag</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Unemployed Workers Temporary Relief Committee of the Ministry of Social Affairs began providing relief to unemployed workers in the city, as of the 15th of this month, a total of 404 factories had applied for relief, with 105,469 unemployed workers. Of these, 51 factories and 8,564 workers were deemed ineligible according to regulations, and 24 factories and 4,871 workers are still under review. A total of 329 factories and 92,034 workers have already received relief. The original relief period for unemployed workers in the city was limited to three months, and this period has now expired. However, the number of factories that have resumed operations is still limited. At its 12th meeting, the committee decided that the application for relief registration should be announced as closed immediately. All registered unemployed workers, except those who have returned to work, will continue to receive relief for three months. The relief method has been agreed upon by the committee and the Shanghai Branch of the Executive Yuan's Post-War Relief Administration, which will allocate flour for relief, and distribution will begin in January 1946. The distribution dates will be announced separately.</p>
<p>The quantity of flour to be distributed is specified as follows:</p>
<p>Distribution Method Has Been Specified</p>
<p>(1) Adult workers will receive 66 city catties (1.5 bags) per month, (2) child workers will receive 44 city catties (1 bag) per month. Adult workers will receive one bag every twenty days, and child workers will receive one bag per month, all for a period of three months. (2) The flour distribution locations are: (1) Pudong District: 1 Huishan Road, No. 4 District Cigarette Workers' Union, Huacheng Branch. 2 Shanghai Laundry Factory at the intersection of Jilin Road, Hongkou. (2) Shanghai West District: 1 Labor Movement Guidance Branch, Macao Road, Xiaoshadu Road. 2 Shuiyue Elementary School, Macao Road, Xiaoshadu Road. (3) Shanghai South District: Qingjietang Municipal General Labor Union, Penglai Road. (4) Shanghai North District: Labor Association, Wuchang Road, Zhapu Road. (5) Pudong District: No. 5 District Party Headquarters, Dongchang Road. (3) When issuing flour vouchers and collecting flour, each factory will be a unit, using a joint guarantee method, with ten people as a group, mutually guaranteeing each other. If it is discovered that someone has returned to work or is fraudulently claiming flour, the distribution of flour to the entire group will be suspended as a form of punishment.</p>
<p>Flour Price Stabilization to be Further Reduced</p>
<p>The second phase of affordable flour will be sold on the 28th. The Relief Administration is entrusting the Fufeng and Fuxin flour companies' joint office to handle the registration. The quantity for sale this time has been greatly increased, with a maximum purchase of 50 bags. Noodle shops and pancake/steamed bun stalls can also participate in the purchase starting this round. It is said that those going to register to purchase the affordable flour are very enthusiastic, and the number is beyond expectations. Due to the sale of this affordable flour, the ordinary market price has been affected and is trending lower. A spokesperson for the Relief Administration said: "There are inevitably some people who intend to hoard the flour. To completely eliminate this kind of attempt, in addition to continuing to sell it continuously, the selling price will also be gradually reduced to make it unprofitable for those who attempt to hoard it. Furthermore, if this kind of situation is discovered, the administration will revoke their right to purchase in the next round."</p>

<h3>Mayor Qian Personally Officiates Marriage of 42 Newlywed Couples; Ties of Victorious Union</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper Reporter Xingwu</p>
<p>The Victory Memorial Group Wedding Ceremony, sponsored by the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, was held yesterday morning at 10:00 AM at the Pudong Building on Zhongzheng Middle Road. More than 2,000 guests attended. Mayor Qian personally officiated the wedding. The ceremony was simple, solemn, and grand. A total of forty-two couples participated in the wedding. During the ceremony, Ge Kexin (representing He Ti'an), the acting director of the Bureau of Social Affairs, read out the certificates. Mayor Qian distributed the marriage certificates separately and gave each couple a copy of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's "China's Destiny" as a souvenir. In addition to Mayor Qian's impromptu wedding speech, guests Yuan Xiluo, Ding Fubao, and others gave insightful speeches. The ceremony concluded at 11:30 AM.</p>
<p>Red Candles Burned High</p>
<p>Almost all of the staff of the Bureau of Social Affairs were dispatched, wearing red satin ribbons that said "Officer," "Master of Ceremonies," etc., busily arranging and directing. A red carpet was laid in the center of the hall, dividing into two paths to the left and right of the door. Large and tall candlesticks with red candles were placed on the sides. The rows of guest seats and family seats were packed. As the time drew near, the forty-two brides and grooms had spent most of the morning dressing and putting on makeup, and everything was ready.</p>
<p>Overflowing with Joy</p>
<p>At 10:15 AM, the wedding ceremony began. The grooms in blue suits and black vests, and the brides in white dresses and pink veils, were overflowing with joy as they lined up in two rows. They slowly entered the venue to the wedding march, long and orderly, and all eyes were drawn to them. The four little pioneers who scattered flowers and carried lanterns were lively and cute, especially attracting the attention of the whole audience.</p>
<p>Mayor Officiates</p>
<p>The wedding officiant, Mayor Qian, arrived early. When the emcee announced that the wedding officiant should enter, he steadily stepped onto the stage and read out the marriage certificate. After the wedding ceremony of bowing three times, he gave a speech, saying: "Marriage is not only a major event in life, but also a major event for the country and society. We should attach importance to the wedding ceremony, but we do not necessarily have to make the wedding ceremony complicated and extravagant. Holding a wedding ceremony should be solemn, but the ceremony should be simple and the expenses should be economical. The system of group weddings can meet this requirement and it is necessary to promote it. From this moment on, each of you newlyweds, who were previously two unrelated individuals, will now become an inseparable family. With a spirit of mutual assistance and responsibility, you should each build a happy family, and together build a prosperous Shanghai and a strong China."</p>
<p>Two Elders Speak</p>
<p>Next, Mr. Yuan Xiluo and Mr. Ding Fubao gave congratulatory speeches. Mr. Yuan humorously congratulated the new couple using the first initials of the words "America, England, Soviet, France." Mr. Ding explained the way to maintain good health in the local dialect of Wuxi, winning applause from the audience. After the speeches, marriage certificates were issued. One pair after another, the distribution continued for almost half an hour, leaving the twenty ushers covered in sweat.</p>
<p>Continuous Bows</p>
<p>Mayor Qian bowed in return forty-two times, standing for more than an hour, but he still stood there vigorously. His neat new suit and newly shaved flat-top haircut shone under the red light of the neon "囍" (double happiness) character, making him look particularly young. Mayor Qian also gave each couple a copy of "China's Destiny," and the wedding ceremony did not end until 12:00.</p>
<p>No Room for Further Savings</p>
<p>This was the first time that the Bureau of Social Affairs has organized a group wedding, and it will continue to do so in the future. In order to be as economical as possible, no refreshments were provided. Each couple only paid 3,500 yuan, including everything for the hall, photos, flowers, etc. Therefore, it was said that it only cost the price of a pair of socks to get married. It is said that the Bureau of Social Affairs subsidized more than 100,000 yuan.</p>
<p>A Statistic</p>
<p>The Bureau of Social Affairs has compiled statistics on the hometown and age of the eighty-four newlyweds, which are recorded as follows: 11 from Shanghai, 39 from Jiangsu Province, 26 from Zhejiang Province, 6 from Guangdong Province, and 2 from other provinces. 18 are between the ages of 17 and 20, 37 are between the ages of 21 and 25, 21 are between the ages of 26 and 30, 6 are between the ages of 31 and 35, and 2 are between the ages of 36 and 39.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Local Love</h3>
<p>— Moyu</p>
<p>Tonight, the moon in Fuzhou,</p>
<p>She watches it alone in her chamber;</p>
<p>Far away, she pities her little children,</p>
<p>Who do not yet understand longing for Chang'an.</p>
<p>Fragrant mist and clouds dampen her hair,</p>
<p>Clear moonlight chills her jade arms;</p>
<p>When will she lean against the gauzy curtains,</p>
<p>The moon shining on both, drying our tear-stained faces!</p>
<p>— Du Fu</p>
<p>The autumn night sky is quiet and desolate, a bleak breeze carrying distant dreams gently sweeps under the eaves. I raise my heavy head and gaze out the window in dismay. The midnight full moon is hanging high in the blue sky, like the face of an anemic person, with a terrible pale color, smiling sadly at weary travelers.</p>
<p>It is excessive fatigue that brings the traveler to this strange, lonely courtyard. Loneliness gnaws at my heart, and I feel a pressure in my chest. Ah, the destruction of the countryside, the displacement of my family—this picture woven with blood, tears, and cruelty stretches my reverie long and far. Shaking my broken heart, locking my heavy eyes, I recite this poem by the Tang dynasty poet Du Fu, and I cannot help but remember that familiar, beloved land.</p>
<p>The baptism of artillery fire, the shouts of the devil's henchmen, and then a poisonous fire destroyed my homeland. Filled with hatred and nostalgia, I embarked on the road of exile, stumbling in the wind and sand. In the past hundreds of days, whenever the full moon hung high in the sky, I would recite Du Fu's verses, once, ten times, twenty times... These few lines quietly paint a thick layer of black rust on my heart, filled with dismay and depression.</p>
<p>Now, after hundreds of days, a string of reveries deepens my memory, shadows and despair climb into my heart, and I have still not been able to rebuild my farm!</p>
<p>After a long period of exile, when the news of victory spread to every corner, everyone felt indescribable joy and comfort, struggling out of the dark abyss, rescued from the stormy waves. The joyful mood and expression almost made people crazy! Because what followed was no longer displacement and sorrow, but the joyful tears of reunion, even embraces! Along with the songs of triumph, many men and women embarked on their return journey to relive their old dreams. But now, I have not been able to prepare to return. I do not have the tough soles of my shoes to step on the thorns of that blood- and tear-stained gray earth, the rubble of the broken countryside. Nor do I want to take a step closer to my homeland before the devil's henchmen are dead!... Moreover, the story of being eaten by worms is still being played out on that grassland!...</p>
<p>So, let the fire of memory burn, let reverie break free from depression, and offer sincere silent prayers and blessings to the people in the distant sky. Under the deep blue night sky, in the pale moonlight, I repeatedly recited Du Fu's verses. Although I do not have the delicate illusions of this old poet when he was in Chang'an, hoping that one day I can "lean against the gauzy curtains" and "the moon shining on both, drying our tear-stained faces," my grief and indignation exceed the imagined realm of his poetry. In particular, I feel that the two lines "Everyone has a home to return to, yet victory finds me still a wandering man" is simply a hot irony for me!</p>
<p>Tonight, my eyes are a little wet, and my heart is beating very hard. A strand of bitterness invades my emotions, and I think of the millions of people on that familiar land being sucked of their blood by poisonous scorpions, millions of eyes still hanging with tears, looking up to the clouds. For the first time, I shed tears for the destruction of my home and the desolation of my homeland!</p>
<p>After a long night comes dawn, and there will be no more haze after a heavy rain. The pain of those who have hope is temporary. But when can all the poison be cleared? When can the wanderer throw himself into the embrace of his homeland and get a chance to breathe? I look up at the stars and the sky.</p>
<p>I believe their doomsday will surely come. Tonight, I angrily tear up Du Fu's poem and throw the white paper strips into the night sky in place of a long sword, and shout out to the people in the distant sky to live bravely!</p>

<p>In a society of extreme progress and extreme conservatism in thought, people think of the Doctrine of the Mean. Some think that "The Doctrine of the Mean" is synonymous with being slick, ambiguous, and lacking a sense of right and wrong, which is incorrect. Take a circle as an example; the center is only one point. This point is the middle, without any flexibility. Although the universe is constantly evolving, the most suitable center varies with time and space. However, no matter what, at every moment, it has its "target."</p>
<p>Some people who are not thorough only do five-tenths of a task and then call it quits. They say things like "know when to stop," "don't go too far," and "rather be a failed attempt at carving a swan than a successful attempt at drawing a tiger that resembles a dog." Their calculation is to please both sides, a tofu knife with both sides shining, a crystal ball with all sides smooth. In reality, this is a dragged-out, incomplete performance. "Not seeking merit, only seeking no fault" is a mediocre act of not daring to do anything. Some people, poisoned by these fallacies, are unaware and develop a lack of creative and adventurous spirit, burying their independent and enterprising ambition.</p>
<p>Those who distort the Doctrine of the Mean think that doing things shouldn't be too thorough because being thorough is not the Doctrine of the Mean and even violates Confucian doctrines, which is also misleading. Confucius hated hypocrites the most, saying, "Hypocrites are the thieves of virtue." What is the archetype of a hypocrite? Mencius and Zeng Zi answered: "They are not criticized, nor are they reproached. They conform to the vulgar customs and blend in with the corrupt world. They appear to be loyal and trustworthy and act with integrity, pleasing everyone, thinking they are right, but cannot be included among Yao and Shun. Therefore, it is said: They are the thieves of virtue." The so-called hypocrites of that time are somewhat similar to the "good people" or "nice guys" of today. Feng Youlan said that these people dare not do great evil, nor can they do great good. Because they dare not do great evil, they "appear to be loyal and trustworthy and act with integrity." Because they cannot do great good, they "conform to the vulgar customs and blend in with the corrupt world." They parrot others and are ambiguous, so "everyone is pleased with them." Because everyone is pleased with them, everyone calls them "good people" or "nice guys." These people are precisely what Confucianism calls "thieves of virtue." Discussing human affairs, exposing traitors, and uncovering the hidden is truly insightful.</p>
<p>So what is the true Doctrine of the Mean? Excess and deficiency are both biased. For example, when walking, you cannot stray too far to the left or too far to the right; otherwise, it is not in the middle and easily leads to detours.</p>
<p>Aristotle, although a great disciple of Plato, had doctrines drastically different from Plato's. Plato's doctrine is based on subjective ideas; Aristotle, on the other hand, bases his on objective facts. The reason is that Aristotle was born almost half a century later than Plato. The era in which Aristotle lived was more advanced than Plato's. The relationships of social affairs became more complex, so his research materials became richer, and his research objects became wider. This is a commonality between ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad. Therefore, later generations have agreed that Plato is the philosophical ancestor of Western cultural history, and Aristotle is the scientific pioneer of Western cultural history. Although Aristotle studied under Plato, he was not a follower who imitated every step without changing a bit; he was a pioneer who carried on the past and opened up the future, not a conservative who rigidly adhered to the rules. Therefore, Aristotle once openly stated, "I love my teacher, but I love truth more." From these two sentences of Aristotle, we know that Aristotle was not a conservative but a creator. Therefore, we should also recognize our times and environment and be people who adapt to the needs of the times and environment, instead of being complacent and content in a corner, just being conservatives, and suffering the natural abandonment of the times and environment.</p>
<p>Kang Youwei's early thinking was sharp and very promising. He enthusiastically engaged in the Reform Movement. Around the time of the Wuxu Coup, he could be said to be a reformer. However, before long, he failed to grasp the times practically and was instead eliminated by the times and environment. In the end, he and Zhang Xun colluded to support the restoration of the puppet Puyi, completing a life's final, pathetic farce, only earning the agreed opinion of being old and stubborn, ending his life that way. Sun Yat-sen, however, was different. He clearly recognized his responsibilities. Throughout his life, regardless of success or failure, he never had any pessimism or timidity. His principles remained the same, and he struggled tirelessly. This fearless spirit of bravely moving forward and sincerely saving the country, and his noble and great character, remained that of a leading figure ahead of the times until he died in Beijing. Therefore, analyzing and summarizing, Kang Youwei was a failure, and Sun Yat-sen was a success. A tiny difference can lead to a vast divide.</p>
<p>The attitude of "getting by" and the mentality of "not caring" are both held by cynical and reckless people. They hold onto an ancient poem that says, "People beg for leftover sacrifices to flaunt their wives and concubines; scholars would rather burn to death than serve an unjust ruler; who knows who is wise or foolish after a thousand years? The entire field is covered in wormwood." They compare Jie Zhitui, who refused to accept office, and the shameless "Qi man" mentioned by Mencius, and offer an explanation of "good and evil are just dreams, wisdom and foolishness are all the same." The so-called "Yao and Shun are just a pile of bones, Jie and Zhou are just a pile of bones." Life is only a few decades. As for wealth, glory, longevity, poverty, and success, once the breath stops, it becomes a rotting corpse. Therefore, they are careless and slack in everything, not serious and not energetic. "When it's time to drink, drink; when it's time to sing loudly, sing loudly." Life is for enjoyment; if the sky falls, use a cotton quilt to cover it; who cares about anything? (The most obvious example is a certain haiku: "Shuffle the mahjong tiles, national affairs, to hell with them.") These people ignore their responsibilities, eat and drink their fill, and only offer satire and contempt for national affairs, without making any contributions; they only offer empty talk and lack concrete suggestions. When the country and society are stable, they spout nonsense, as if the great principles of governing the country and pacifying the world are all in their full-fledged plans. However, when an incident suddenly occurs, they have no plan in their minds, panicking and blaming others. At worst, they take advantage of the chaos to achieve their own goals of profit and fame.</p>
<p>Historically, some have rewarded hermits. The so-called "the wise avoid the world, the next avoid the land..." is the best example. In fact, these are just tumors of the country and nation, living corpses. As the wheel of the great era advances relentlessly, how can it allow such selfish and self-serving people to exist? Natural selection is inevitable; it's just a matter of time.</p>
<p>If everyone can hold the mentality of "If not me, then who?" and refuse to shirk responsibility, then all undertakings in the country and society will have a way, and not only will the War of Resistance be won, but nation-building will also surely succeed.</p>
<p>Some people think that in a volatile and unpredictable society, one can never escape the preconceived notions of being either master or slave, right or wrong, and that there is no real right and wrong in the world. They hear and witness those lucky nouveau riches and temporarily patched-up corrupt characters: their living and eating, their unrestrained spending, their luxurious clothes and utensils, their arrogant gestures; while others devote themselves to academics, bury themselves in writing, or work hard in the office all day long, or work in the rain and wind with calloused hands and feet, and the rewards they receive, the food, clothing, housing, transportation, education, and recreation they enjoy, and the support they give to their families are vastly different. They then rush to the conclusion that there is a lack of true right and wrong and no good and evil in the universe. When a person is living in bad conditions, mentally distressed, and environmentally oppressed, it is easy to stir up such resentment. However, if we take a step back or look further, we can see that these lucky or corrupt figures are like ephemeral flowers, coming in unjustly and going out unjustly, with no way to continue for long. Moreover, their mental anguish of scheming and working hard cannot be compared to that of people who are "content with what they have and are always happy." Jesus once said about his own life: "Foxes have holes, and birds have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head." Yan Hui lived in a humble alley, eating one basket of food and drinking one ladle of water, using his arm as a pillow, and was still happy. Being content in poverty and finding joy in the Tao is enjoying one's own happiness. Being obsessed with luxury is not only chronic suicide but is actually like drinking poison to quench thirst. "Borrowing money from usurers" is the behavior of prodigal sons and enchanting women, and anyone with a little self-esteem, self-love, self-respect, and self-reliance would not bother to do it. Especially in times of national crisis, when nation-building has not yet been completed, we should automatically cultivate a style and habit of thrift and frugality. As the saying goes, "Only by enduring the greatest hardships can one become a great man." Wang Xinmin also said, "If people often eat vegetable roots, then everything can be done." Although life is not absolutely about valuing hardship, those who cannot be content with simplicity for the sake of the times and environment will not be able to have unwavering integrity and will easily be tempted by material desires and change their will. Generally, those who lose their reputation and integrity are definitely those corrupt elements who are deeply addicted to desires. If you don't believe it, you can review the spineless invertebrates and maggots of the pseudo-organizations in various places before the war, which is a real proof.</p>
<p>Doing things should have a resolute and decisive spirit, and one should not have an ambiguous and wavering attitude. Huang Yuanyong once pointed out that the public poison of the Chinese people is "vagueness." Everything is often vague and not thoroughly correct. Yes, as in the past, the sentences in official documents of the authorities, such as "there is a reason for the incident, but no evidence can be found," have already been passed down as jokes in official documents. And some people talk about things with a set of irresponsible and empty words like "it seems," "maybe," "apparently," "roughly," "perhaps," "not without," and "allowing" to show that they understand the art of conversation and will not let the other party grasp their central point. This slickness and glibness really affects people's minds in society, with utmost importance and magnitude. Now that everything requires a scientific and practical approach, how should we thoroughly eliminate these empty, unconfirmed, movable, and indecisive words that lack decisiveness? At the very least, one should be responsible for what one says to others and be truthful and clear. Otherwise, if one speaks evasively and insincerely, it is difficult for the other party to observe some real phenomena, like looking at flowers in the fog after talking with you for a night.</p>
<p>Jia Yi's "Peng Bird Ode": "Heaven and earth are iron, and creation is the craftsman; yin and yang are charcoal, and all things are copper." Some compare it to society being a furnace, the leaders of society (the country) being the craftsmen, their actions being the charcoal, and the general masses being the steel. When an individual enters society, they are mostly melted by society. This explanation is extremely appropriate. We know that the leaders of society (the country) lead their masses, and their masses support their leaders. In this way, mutual encouragement and close association can produce a kind of internally substantial action, which is not easily shaken.</p>
<h3>Feeling After Staying in Chongqing for a Long Time</h3>
<p>— Chen Sanshou</p>
<p>Aimlessly staying as a guest for several springs, the past heroic sentiments have all turned into dust; long illness makes me afraid to hear the cicadas chirping, and prolonged leisure makes me miss the sound of the ocean tides; the big river surrounds the city, and I know the fish are delicious; the young child clings to me, and I feel genuine love. Where is my home in the east? White clouds drift and stir my longing to return!</p>

<h3>A Bright Light in the Darkness</h3>
<p>— Wu Renzhi</p>
<p>In Shanghai, there are many asphalt roads that look flat and very smooth. However, in reality, it just looks that way.</p>
<p>When you walk along these roads on a rainy day, and mud splashes on your body, or your feet step on a few puddles, then you will feel that these roads still have many bumps.</p>
<p>These bumps on the roads are certainly invisible in the dark, but they are not necessarily obvious in the daytime. Only in the dark, when the two lights of a car are shining brightly toward you, will you immediately see that these very flat and very smooth asphalt roads are full of bumps.</p>
<p>Then I suddenly realized. People will not feel the unevenness of the world until they encounter difficulties.</p>
<p>And the place where this unevenness of the world is located, you cannot see it clearly in the dark, and you may not be able to distinguish it clearly after the so-called dawn. Only under a bright light in the darkness will you be able to see clearly.</p>
<p>Isn't it? A bright light in the darkness is the true light. Under the so-called bright daylight, it may become a bright light to whitewash peace.</p>
<h3>Warrior, When Will You Return?</h3>
<p>— Chen Gange</p>
<p>Warrior: Since we parted in Qingdao in September 1941, for the past four years, I have been living in an environment of blood and tears, just like you relying on the 14-inch guns on the battleships in the ocean. During this time, I had endless words to tell you, but in the end, I couldn't overcome the environment, and I am still being controlled by it. So, I can only wait, wait for you and your comrades to return triumphantly! However, your comrades have now returned in glory, receiving people's welcome and admiration, but what about you?</p>
<p>You left behind sixty US dollars when you left, and also left behind my old mother, two younger brothers, one younger sister, and me and my son, five people in total; we need to live through the long days. In the most difficult times, we reduced from three meals a day to two meals, and then to one meal. We changed from snow-white rice to thin porridge, and then to sweet potatoes, and pearl rice noodles; sometimes we even starved like Boyi and Shuqi. At that time, in the midst of extreme hardship, we still did not dare to complain or curse. I firmly believed that you would return one day and restore our original life. So, with no other choice, we sold your furniture, piece by piece, to survive!</p>
<p>It was on such a day, February 9, 1943, that the entire Nanjing Road was blockaded by the Japanese army, for one day, two days... We were starving, starving, and on the morning of the third day, we finally couldn't stand the attack of hunger, so your beloved son Ming, risking danger, tried to sneak out of this death circle. I, looking out from the window, was as desperate as he was, blessing his success in escaping.</p>
<p>He stepped out of the gate and was about to cross the barbed wire fence, "Bang! Bang! Bang!" Watching him fall down, I seemed to scream and then fainted.</p>
<p>When I woke up, two Japanese soldiers and an interpreter were standing in front of me, emphasizing that the child had committed a crime and was shot, and had been sent to the local naval hospital.</p>
<p>For seven weeks, the pressure of life and the worries of the matter added a lot of white hair to my head. Fortunately, Ming had hope of survival, otherwise, I would be reduced to bones by now! In the tenth week, he was finally released from prison, both sick and guilty, with his sentence expired.</p>
<p>Listen to this! Your old mother fell ill, and was sick for forty-nine days. What could I do to ask a doctor to treat her? Every day she groaned, and every day we starved. We sold everything. On the forty-ninth day, she returned to the Western Paradise, jumping out of our life circle. Again, with no other choice, we sold many clothes to give her a hasty burial, finally fulfilling a daughter-in-law's responsibility, under difficult conditions!</p>
<p>Following that, your second younger brother also died young. I don't know where he died, but he left home sick and has not been seen since!</p>
<p>I condensed blood and tears into black handwriting. When people were singing and dancing, I sobbed and picked up my pen, looking at my family all wearily sleeping on the ground. How can I face you? — With this broken family! But in my contradictory heart, I always miss you, the warrior who is bringing honor to the country!</p>
<h3>Four Tragedies of *Dream of the Red Chamber*</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>(General Preface to the *Dream of the Red Chamber* Script)</p>
<p>This play is adapted based on the original *Dream of the Red Chamber*, with a research attitude. Each episode is independent; the theme is independent; only the plot and time have connections. For example, I arranged "Soul of Poetry, Cold Moon," which mainly focuses on Bao and Dai, as the first episode; "Snow Sword, Mandarin Ducks," which mainly focuses on the Second You, as the second episode; "Flowing Water, Flying Flowers," which mainly focuses on the Three Springs, as the third episode; and "Zen Forest, Returning Birds," which mainly focuses on Granny Jia and Jia Zheng, as the fourth episode; this development process is exactly the development process of the original *Dream of the Red Chamber*.</p>
<p>I have attached detailed prefaces to the first, second, and third episodes, respectively, at the beginning of the book, explaining the writing process and the analysis of the theme. Only the fourth episode has no preface, so now I will add a few words.</p>
<p>*Dream of the Red Chamber* experts have made many "indexes" of the *Dream of the Red Chamber*, and everyone speculates differently about the allusive objects of this masterpiece. Some say: "It is the biography of the author Cao Xueqin himself"; others say: "It is a portrayal of the politics of the Manchu Qing Dynasty"; I feel that these statements all make sense. If Cao Xueqin did not have the life experience of those customs, habits, human relationships, and worldly affairs written in the *Dream of the Red Chamber*, then he would never have been able to describe them so realistically. Similarly, because Cao Xueqin observed the era in which he lived too thoroughly, he could not help but feel a myriad of emotions, so he used his wise pen to depict all the evil forms of that era. The literary value of the *Dream of the Red Chamber* lies in the depth of these philosophies of life and society. If "it is the biography of Cao Xueqin himself," it is not just the biography of Cao Xueqin but of everyone in his era. At the same time, Cao Xueqin not only "portrays" the politics of the Manchu Qing Dynasty; he simply portrays the politics of all dynasties. When reading the *Dream of the Red Chamber*, one should not only focus on the story but also strive to understand the philosophy it reveals. When studying the *Dream of the Red Chamber*, one should especially not make a narrow index but should look into the distance and at the big picture. In this way, you can see its far-reaching reflection.</p>
<p>The first episode of the *Red* play, "Soul of Poetry, Cold Moon," can be called: a personal tragedy; the second episode, "Snow Sword, Mandarin Ducks," can be called: a family tragedy; the third episode, "Flowing Water, Flying Flowers," can be called: a social tragedy; the fourth episode, "Zen Forest, Returning Birds," can be called: a political tragedy. Although such a distinction is not without some forced interpretation, it is indeed following these four stages of deep advancement. I hope that this adaptation method of mine can help readers of the *Dream of the Red Chamber* in their understanding.</p>
<p>These are all due to the corruption of the times, which has caused various types of tragedies. The remaining poison of this corruption of the times is still lurking with some forces and has not been thoroughly eliminated and eradicated; therefore, the world is still not peaceful, and humanity will never have peace and happiness!</p>
<p>Isn't the collapse of the Jia family in the *Dream of the Red Chamber* a microcosm of the collapse of a country? Why did the Jia family reach this point? The reason is the poor family governance; the disunity of family members; everyone having selfish motives; everyone holding their own opinions, leading to collapse. Similarly, a country can collapse because of poor national governance; the disunity of the people; everyone fighting for power; everyone seizing benefits. As Cao Xueqin described at the time, the wind of corruption and bribery is still visible today; this proves the accuracy of Cao Xueqin's "perspective." In the fourth episode of the *Red* play, "Zen Forest, Returning Birds," I specifically presented this reflection of reality from the front; at the same time, I emphasized Cao Xueqin's transcendent worldview from the side; I hope this can promote an awakening of the times!</p>
<p>These casual words may inevitably have some errors; please provide corrections.</p>

<h3>On Quitting Smoking Without Worry (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Hu Qipeng</p>
<p>This newspaper previously published a letter from Mr. Xi Lian'an, requesting the selection and publication of "Knowledge of Opium Smoking" for the reference of countless blacklisted compatriots, with good intentions. Since the publication of this letter, this office has received dozens of letters and submissions from various readers, among which one gentleman said: "Statistically, among thousands of readers, there are countless parents, brothers, sisters, and relatives who are trapped by opium addiction. They are also our compatriots. If we can provide them with knowledge of quitting opium addiction and save them from the sea of suffering, it would be a work of immeasurable merit." In view of this, this office has specially selected a recent article by Dr. Hu, which emphasizes both theory and practice and is concise and well-prepared in content, and can serve as a mirror for opium addicts. This article contains 2,400 words and will be published in four installments. Please cut and paste it after reading it for later viewing.—Editor</p>
<p>The harm of opium addiction, harming the country and harming the people, is known to everyone and need not be repeated. What I want to talk about here is the knowledge of opium smoking, in order to make smokers understand that there is no incurable opium addiction, and to encourage the courage to succeed and strengthen their will.</p>
<p>I. Types of Opium Addiction</p>
<p>Various kinds of opium drugs were originally a kind of medicine used to treat diseases in medicine. Because they have the functions of relieving pain, calming, and anesthetizing in treatment, they are called narcotic drugs. Among them, the most commonly used as opium drugs are opium. To this day, morphine, heroin, codeine, cocaine, etc., are all addictive to use. There are also a few people who take other non-narcotic drugs, such as arsenic and strychnine, and become addicted. I once treated a case where a person became addicted to smoking the white smoke that occurred after a match was extinguished.</p>
<h3>A Helpful Landlord</h3>
<p>There is a letter for Zou Shizhen from his family.</p>
<p>Please come quickly to collect it and celebrate the reunion.</p>
<p>A letter from a reader of our newspaper, Mr. Ming Jun, states: "Respectfully, there is a letter from Singapore from Mr. Zou Yuxian, with the envelope addressed to 'Zou Shizhen, son, for receipt.' We have checked our home, and there is no such person. We presume they are relatives of a former tenant. We have lived here for three years, and since Mr. Zou does not know his son's current address, it is possible that they have not communicated since the outbreak of the Pacific War, and their whereabouts have been unknown for a long time. Now that there is a letter, we should immediately find a way to notify 'Mr. Zou Shizhen' to collect it. Because we do not know where the former tenant moved, nor whether Mr. Zou Shizhen is a relative of the former tenant, and because we have long admired your newspaper's dedication to serving society, we dare to request that you publish this in your newspaper to notify Mr. Zou Shizhen or his family to pay attention and come to the Yu residence at 604 Rue Laborie to collect it so that Mr. Zou's family can celebrate their reunion, which would also be a meritorious deed."</p>
