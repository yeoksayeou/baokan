<h3>北海道地區基地港灣　前日初次遭空襲　敵艦艇一部砲擊釜石附近</h3>
<p>日大本營發表</p>
<p>東京十五日中央社電　日大本營十四日下午四時三十分發表：　敵艦載機十四日晨數次來襲東北地方及北海道南部地區我方航空基地與港灣，　同日正午，敵艦艇一部亦與此呼應，對釜附石近實施艦砲射擊。</p>
<p>東京十五日中央社電　十四日晨，敵機動部隊之艦載機，曾來襲日東北地方及北海道南部地區，十五日上午六時許，復以戰艦，巡洋艦，驅逐艦等組成之機動部隊一部，來襲北海道及東北地方，同時並以戰艦，巡洋艦組成之敵機動部隊一部，自下午九時迄十時之間，向北海道室蘭方面之工塲設施，施行艦砲射擊。</p>
<p>東京十五日中央社電　敵機動部隊前曾於冲繩海域遭日軍特攻隊之不斷猛攻，喪失航空母艦勢力約逾半數，然其後乃竭力銳意整備，十日黎明時，於關東地區東南方海上，以航空母艦等十餘艘組成之機動部隊，接近日本土近海，並以艦載機約一千二百架左右，終日襲擊關東各地之日方航空基地，其後因天氣及其他關係，遂即退出東方海上之我方威力圈外，待機來犯。十四日又接近本土，以艦載機對東北地方及北海道南部地區之日方航空基地與港灣加以攻擊，同時其艦艇一部亦與此呼應，對釜石方面施行艦砲射擊。按敵艦載機來襲東北及北海道，尙屬初次，而當時復以艦砲射擊，但吾人不能認為此時敵艦砲射擊即為登陸之第一步，蓋敵軍施行此種艦砲射擊，僅屬牽制作戰而已，目前並無登陸之企圖。故此次敵機來襲東北，北海道方面，係為擴展馬里亞納基地B29型機之行動　，使能伸及於該方面。同時，敵為謀摧毀日方航空兵力，是以敵機動部隊隨帶有油　船在內，於二三週間可以單獨行動，據此觀之，今後敵艦戰機恐將繼續來襲本土沿岸，其艦砲亦恐續行射擊沿岸地區。</p>
<h3>東亞各地戰况</h3>
<p>東京十五日中央社電　大東亞各地一週戰况如下：　敵基地航空兵力行動大勢觀之，馬里亞納方面之兵力，於本週分散各地，有數處同時空襲之傾向，硫黃島之P51型及PB4Y型等機，對東海軍管區地區之飛機塲攻擊，並對日本本土沿岸各港灣加以機雷封鎖。冲繩方面之敵航空兵力動向，其後逐步前進，並強化本島方面之基地，已有中型機及夜間虞鬥機等出現，向九州方面之飛機塲來襲，預料今後將更呈强化。同時，敵軍必須動員多數之船舶，並傾注龐大資材，成為航空兵力中心之特攻航空中心作戰，連日實施攻擊，與敵甚大之打擊。　菲律賓方面之日軍部隊，續以呂宋北部之卡牙因谷溪為反攻據點，展開活躍奮勇之決戰，敵陸上軍因接連遭受損耗犧牲，最近兵力極感不足，而以第　第十三師之黑人部隊調向卡牙因，以圖挽回頹勢。同時，菲律賓之敵空軍，分別以一部對台灣攻擊，另一部對婆羅洲作戰，其餘一半調至冲繩本島，於此可見誇示航空兵力之敵人，因戰域日漸擴大，而感空軍力配備難以各方顧及。　婆羅洲方面，泰拉干·峇厘巴板·婆羅乃等各地區，雙方正對峙中，米里方面日軍於各處加緊猛攻，尤以峇厘巴板西北展開激戰，阻遏敵之前進，而敵之企圖極為頑固，仍源源增兵力於第一綫，急圖前進。　泰爾納特島，迄至七月十二日，日守備部隊將登陸敵軍向北部壓迫，予以痛烈攻擊。　印度洋方面，英艦隊之活動雖逐漸有活潑化之傾向，而七月五·六兩日，敵海上部隊又向卡尼科巴爾羣島方面侵入，在加摩爾塔南北方及西方科塔拉底方面蠢動，並於十一日以包括空母二艘之敵機動部隊，出動艦載機二百架來襲，太平洋方面之戰况，因敵軍對南方資源地帶之野心益形露骨，故其今後動向宜加警戒。</p>
<h3>波蘭牧師談　日决戰情形</h3>
<p>蘇黎世十五日中央社電　據赫爾新基之法國通訊社電稱，一閱月前由日本歸來而勾留於赫爾新基之波蘭牧師七名，曾談述日本決戰之情形如次：日本國民被轟炸而遭災害者，雖謂甚衆，然並無一人屈於空襲之下，且每人之信念始終堅定，稍有恐懼，認為戰期無論延長至若干年，而勝利必歸日本。日本之食糧雖相當困窘，然而凡在可能範圍內可得着手者，均予以公平之分配，吾等旅日人士，毫不受限制也。</p>
<h3>菲基地美機　炸廣州市區</h3>
<p>廣州十五日中央社電　菲律賓基地美空軍，十二·十三兩日以戰鬥及轟炸機聯合編隊約五十架，濫炸廣州市內各處，曾於西關·河南兩區內之華人住宅街，投下百公斤至二百五十公斤之巨型炸彈，竟施行羢氈式之轟炸暴舉。</p>
<h3>喜丹河套　日軍活躍</h3>
<p>里斯本十五日中央社電　英印軍緬甸前綫司令部十三日發表如次：日軍於緬甸喜丹河套一帶之行動漸呈活潑，日軍有集結力於庇古東北三十六公里地點之形勢。</p>
<h3>義對日宣戰</h3>
<p>里斯本十五日中央社電　據羅馬來電：義大利政府於十四日發表布吿稱，義大利現已決定對日本正式宣戰。</p>

<h3>再為淸寒優秀學子請命</h3>
<p>本報舉辦讀者助學金運動以來，已歷八屆，雖然不能說有什麽大的成功，但是由於讀者諸君的熱心敎育，熱烈協助及盡力捐輸，這幾年來因此而從失學苦海中拯救出來的淸寒優秀學子，確屬不少。別的善行，施而不望報，實際上也無法嚴密查考，惟有對於助學運動，却是不同，多捐助一筆款子，即多救助幾名學生，他們的學業品行成績，都可查考；直接間接都有利於社會國家，所以我們過去提出「助學最善，助學最樂」的口號，證明這種善行之特別値得誇耀和歌頌。</p>
<p>最近第九屆助學募款運動開始之日，我們曾以「為淸寒學子請命」一文，希望讀者諸君盡最大努力，踴躍捐助，熱心勸募，共襄其成。這一次勸募助學金運動，募款數目和以前各屆比較，超過極鉅，也就是說對於各界善士的期待特別迫急，所以我們有再為淸寒優秀學子向各界請命而申述所見的必要。為什麽呢？目前社會和國家的環境，都在轉捩關頭，環境無論好壞，中下階層市民的經濟狀况異常艱困，維持生活已感極大困難，對於子女敎養都不得不放在第二位。結果竞使成千成萬的優秀學子，退出學校，浪跡市井，為生活而奔波泥塗，為口腹而喪失敎育。試問此種情形任其繼續，未來中國政治文化各方面將受如何嚴重的影響？所以我們不僅要繼續舉辦舊生助學運動，使過去曾受社會助學之惠的學生，不致失學；而且决定酌收新生，使過去尙堪自給今後勢將失學的優秀靑年，也有接受社會恩惠而繼續完成其學業的機會。</p>
<p>為了達到這種為國家社會搶救失學優秀靑年的理想，根據最低的估計，預定勸募目標為三萬萬元。為便於籌集，分為榮譽隊每隊至少一百萬元，及普通隊每隊至少十萬元兩種。不過因為距離下學期開學的日子只有一個多月了，所以希望在一個月內達到這個目標，那就是說，一天至少要收到捐款一千萬元。為着表示我們對此的誠意和决心，本報及本報同人，雖為號稱最淸寒的文化事業及文化工作者，也先行自認榮譽隊兩隊，希望處境比我們富裕一些的，能大量的捐輸，即和我們相同的，也不必灰心，可以湊集起來成立一隊或數隊。</p>
<p>而收到的捐款，總計不過一千三百餘萬元，距離預定的目標，相關得太遠了！想到成千成萬的眼巴巴地等待着助學金，得以繼續其學業的靑年，我們每一個工作人員都不自禁其熱淚奪眶而出！回顧十天內的捐款，除了一總價小數額的熱心捐助者外，大部分是節約壽慶或祭典開支，以親友所贈禮金折現移助，這是非常値得提倡的善舉，但是，我們更希望一般經濟環境比較寬裕的，慷慨解囊，自認或經募若干榮譽隊，打破我們歷屆助學金的紀錄。其次，這次中實網球會舉行助學網球賽，成績極佳，可見樂善人士正多，今後極盼各方面熱心人士利用各種方法來成我們這次助學運動。同時，我們還特別懇摯地期望歷屆熱心勸募及捐助的諸大善士，再接再厲，踴躍為善，使人們以及關心助學事業者，能够早些破涕為笑，替千萬學子狂歡歌頌！</p>
<h3>戰時生活應有的態度</h3>
<p>在敵機頻製下，日本內地人民的生活，不免受到相當影響，有許多無辜的老百姓，在漫無差別的轟炸下，喪失了住屋家財，生活上自多不便。因此，有些無知的人，竟也抱怨生活的困苦。遇到逆境而流露不堪忍受的心情，原是人類共通的弱點。然而，勝利即在眼前，只要懂得如何去爭取就行。因此，每日新聞社記者特去訊問鶴見（東京近郊）總持寺的方丈渡邊玄宗禪師，關於戰時生活的態度，對談如下：</p>
<p>實行自我反省</p>
<p>（問）最近，常常聽到國民道德墮落等等的話，方丈對此有何高見？</p>
<p>（答）是的，我也聽到過，但我不如此想。生活煎迫下，人們的心仍舊可合於道義的。一天反省五分十分鐘，就不會越軌了。</p>
<p>（問）不過，禪師所說的反省，與敎養有關，要一般老百姓就自行反省，豈非太難？</p>
<p>（答）是的。敎養就是知慧。知是物的本件；慧則是它的動作，正和燭及其燭光的關係一般，對於大局的判斷，也可以有一個標的。要一般人自己反省，或許不合理，然而，不是有政治在嗎？</p>
<p>提高國民道德</p>
<p>（問）國民道德縱然沒有墜地，但國民道德心的低下，不是足以影響到戰爭嗎？</p>
<p>（答）戰爭因後方崩潰而失敗的，史上很多。所以國民的道德心確實對戰爭的遂行有很大作用，務必設法提高。不過，我國國民的道德心，決不低於英美。固然，一般言之，英美國民富於常識，但其與道德心的連繫，並不正確。格物不精，則反為事物所囿。不囿於物，不拘於理，這種自由無礙的境地，纔是禪的極致。就德國的失敗而言，德人因為過於自信科學力量，以致對於事物太過主觀，而有忽略其客觀動作的傾向。因此，一度敗北，即失去了自信。於是，弱點暴露了。</p>
<p>（問）與道德心一樣，糧食發生問題時，也會沮喪國民的士氣吧。</p>
<p>（答）今日我們但求果腹，雖粗　亦無妨。關於糧食問題，如有這樣的心理，那就無足慮了。若無珍饈而便志氣頹喪的，還是死了好。我從小即慣於粗食，今日的配給，在我已覺很好。我當然不是要大家都同我一樣，不過，我們都該忍耐一點。</p>
<p>（問）關於B29型機的空襲，有何感想？</p>
<p>空襲時應該鎭靜</p>
<p>（答）沒有別的感想。今日的事情，從戰爭一開始時，就已料到了。然而，奇怪的是：竟有人在房屋被燬時慌張起來。人不免一死。死時，一切都帶不走。只要自己不死，燒掉屋子有什麽大不了！前天，我的親戚跑來找我，說房屋燬了，吃的也沒有。看他年紀靑靑的，竟說出沒志氣的話來，好不叫我火　。所以我也沒好氣的對他說：防空壕裏也可住，野草也可吃哪！二十五日夜空襲時，在烟火中，我聽到飛過頭上的B29型機的隆隆聲，眞是惡魔的狂吼哪！那是和平時隱藏在假面具下的魔鬼心發出來的。所以若不治服了它，眞正的和平一定無望。</p>
<p>特攻隊與日本精神</p>
<p>（問）對於特攻隊有什麽感想嗎？</p>
<p>（答）啊，沒有適當的話語可贊美哩！特攻隊是日本精神的具體的表現。因此，我想，凡是日本人，在緊急的時候，都可以成為特攻隊。這一點，不是日本人精神上的長處嗎？兩三日前，我到東京去，從電車的窗口望望沿海情形，只見房屋還在冒烟。可是，我深深相信，日本人一定會從這焦土中站起來。從今以後，我們才能拿出眞正的力量來！（譯每日新聞）</p>
<h3>敵機分數編隊　襲九州地區　日制空隊墜毀其兩架</h3>
<p>東京十五日中央社電　來自冲繩基地之敵小型機約四十架，十四日下午二時左右，來　南九州地方，施行無任何組織之攻擊，迄三時逸去。B29型十架，十四日上午零時左右，來　九州地區，亘一小時，於關門地區投下機雷。又另一批B29型十二架，於同時刻在西南海面唐津灣·博多灣等投下機雷，日制空部隊曾擊落敵機一架，擊毀一架。</p>
<p>福岡十五日中央社電　冲繩基地敵機B24型P51型，F4V型等戰鬥及轟炸機連合約百七十架，十五日上午九時左右，分成數編隊，以主力來襲熊本·長崎·福岡·大牟田地區，一部攻擊飛機塲及軍事施設，下午二時左右逸去，日方損害輕微。</p>
<p>東京十五日中央社電　敵艦戰機少數編隊，十五日上午八時左右來襲秋田·靑森方面，亘二小時，曾以機槍掃射鐵道設施，港灣及飛機塲。</p>
<p>日貨物船擊墜敵機</p>
<p>靑森十五日中央社電　十四日敵機動部隊起飛之艦載機一編隊，曾襲擊停泊於靑森港之船舶，當時有貨物船一艘獲接敵機來襲之警報後，即刻迅速退避，但終於淺蟲海岸附近被敵機編隊發見，而向該船攻擊。該貨船當即發砲應戰，一面於硝烟中巧妙退避，轉瞬見敵機忽吐出黑烟墮落，繼之另一敵機又被對空砲火所擊中，於是其餘敵機即倉惶遁走，日貨船雖受若干損傷，但仍無大礙。</p>
<h3>英兵員傷亡　逾百四十萬</h3>
<p>瑞　京城十五日中央社電　據倫敦電，英情報部十二日發表：英國自開戰以來，兵員損害總數一百四十三萬七千六百三十四名，其中陣亡者五十四萬二千二百三十三名，受傷者三十三萬六千零二十九名，失踪者五十五萬九千三百七十二名。</p>
<h3>渝參政會　發生風波</h3>
<p>廣州十五日中央社電　渝國民參政會自召開以來，因延安之不參加問題，及舉行國民大會之意見等，致會議即遭遇相當難局。據合衆社重慶電稱，蔣介石之開會演詞，復又釀成風波，因將之演說一部，為檢閱當局所删除，致參政委員方面認為此種措置，顯係侮辱國民參政會，乃向檢閱當局嚴重抗議，迄十一日蔣之演詞未揭載部份始行發表。據傳成為問題之要點，乃關於渝延紛爭事件，由是可知渝延糾紛之深刻複雜云</p>
<p>接到發現敵機動部隊的報吿後日本新銳雷擊機隊自基地踴躍出擊</p>
<h3>峇厘巴板戰塲　移密林地帶　日特攻隊重創美驅艦</h3>
<p>西南太平洋基地十五日中央社電　峇厘巴板之決戰塲，已由海岸移向密林及丘陵地帶，敵軍之傷亡逐日增大。十一日敵之砲擊不甚激烈，日軍乃乘機迎戰，殺敵百五十名，擱挫敵戰車數輛。又為防衛鄕土而執戈奮起之印地西安人民義勇軍，亦奮勇作戰，以手溜彈攻擊，使敵軍傷亡甚衆。本月十一日深宵，日航空部隊曾攻擊峇厘巴板港外之敵艦船，擊沉敵驅逐艦一艘。</p>
<p>里斯本十五日中央社電　據舊金山來電，美海軍當局十二日發表稱：美驅逐艦「奧夫萊因」號，五月二十七日於慶良間羣島海面，遭日特攻隊攻擊，損傷甚重，目下正於某海軍工廠修理中。又該艦於此役中，死傷兵員達一百五十名。</p>
<h3>日促越三國　加强自治</h3>
<p>河內十五日中央社電　越總督府為加强安南，柬埔寨及琅勃刺邦三國之自治性，並促其早日獨立，特將過去直屬總督府之土木局，關稅與專賣局等組織之一部權限，委讓予該三國政府，此事總督府情報局業於十二日下午發表。</p>
<h3>西姆拉會議　迄無成就　會議前日起重開</h3>
<p>里斯本十五日中央社電　據西姆拉電稱：由上月二十九日起停頓迄今之西姆拉會議，復於十四日繼續舉行。但據華維爾聲稱，此次之會議已吿失敗云。</p>
<p>里斯本十五日中央社電　據英京消息：在倫敦之印度事務局昨日發表稱，印度總督華維爾勛爵所召開之西姆拉印度領袖會議，毫無成就而吿結束。該項消息之原文謂，「英國政府宣佈此項為討論改革印度執行而召開之西姆拉會議，未能使印度民衆與英國政府間獲得協議，而卒吿毫無成就結束，實為大憾事。」同時華維爾勛爵本人，對此次會議之失敗，更覺懊傷不已。</p>
<h3>英軍當局對德　撤消親和禁條</h3>
<p>里斯本十五日中央社電　據路透社訊：蒙高茂萊將軍昨日正式宣佈撤消對德軍民「無友好」之禁條，以步蘇軍當局之後塵·蒙氏曾於是日親向其部下軍隊頒佈此項法令，及後　又將此次法令轉播與德國民衆，略謂，「關於消滅德國佔領區內納粹主義及納粹化之各項實施，已頗見成效，現在在德英軍與當地成年德國民衆，可以交談接觸」。該項消息播出後，在許福特一帶之英德軍民盛傳不已。</p>
<h3>蘇渝發共同聲明　雙方已獲諒解　宋子文一行遄返重慶</h3>
<p>瑞典京城十五日中央社電　據莫斯科電，蘇聯政府及渝方關於此次宋子文與史太林會談，於十四日發表共同聲明如次：「蘇聯及重慶於過去兩週內，舉行數次會談，關於兩國關係之各重要問題，已獲得相互間之了解。史太林議長因亟須赴柏林會見特魯曼及邱吉爾，故會談暫時中止。渝行政院長宋子文已啓程返渝，會談將於最近期骨重開」。</p>
<p>瑞典京城十五日中央社電　據莫斯科電：宋子文與史太林議長舉行六次會談後，宋氏一行已於十四日由莫斯科返抵重慶。　宋氏係將此行會談結果，向蔣介石有所報吿，並協議對策，並預定於最近再度訪蘇繼續會談。又莫斯科廣播關於此次渝蘇會談發表稱，雙方於融和之空氣中進行談話，業已達到互相了解之目的矣。</p>
<p>會談眞相無從探悉</p>
<p>里斯本十五日中央社電　史太林宋子文之會談，前後已達五次，惟其會談之內容，莫斯科與重慶殆均保持沉默態度，是以無從獲悉其一切眞相。僅英國及中立國之報章載稱，　蘇會談旣欲國共合作，以期解決建樹聯合政府，劃定外蒙之地位等問題，莫斯科與重慶之意見決難接近，預料宋子文之交涉前途相當困難。據觀察報八日之評論稱，莫斯科會談，渝方以美國為後援，但蘇聯決不欲美國之關心集中於重慶，現蘇聯之影響力雖僅限於延安地區，然其對華政策之企圖，則希望中國實現與蘇有友好關係之統一聯合政府。同時國民黨首領並未注意中共所提議建設聯合政府之問題，而中共亦拒絕派遣代表出席國民參政會，故此促成今日國共雙方之決裂，宋子文如不能打破此種難關，必將失去蔣介石之信賴。且莫斯科會議目的，並不止於國共問題一點而已，總而言之，如不能解決此項問題，則該會談將失其意義。又國民報就外蒙總理喬伊巴爾孫參加史宋會議，亦加推測稱，此次會談僅討論外蒙之地位，但蘇聯政府決不贊成將外蒙共和國再編入中國領土，若蘇聯如能停止進入新疆，則重慶或準備犧牲外蒙，亦未可知云。</p>
<h3>英駐蘇大使　應邀抵華沙</h3>
<p>中央社訊　據塔斯社華沙訊：英國駐蘇大使寇爾爵士，慶波蘭國會主席貝魯脫之邀，於七月十二日抵達華沙。在華沙機塲上歡迎寇爾爵士者，有主席之個人代表，各國駐波蘭政府代表與外交部代表。</p>
<h3>義法西斯要員　三名被拘捕</h3>
<p>中央社訊　據塔斯社羅馬訊：羅馬電台廣播來自佛洛倫斯之消息稱，重要法西斯黨員斯卜蒂尼與哥勒爾米，已被該地當局逮捕，日內將受審於最高法庭。同時並有消息證實，黑衫黨領袖貝里西尼已民為當地警察局拘獲，將在佛洛倫斯之最高法庭受審。</p>
<h3>法律師主張　貝當應處死刑</h3>
<p>里斯本十五日中央社電　據巴黎消息：法國辯護律師瑪納爾，鑒於前維希政府元首貝當將軍即將於七月廿三日受審，極力主張處貝當以死刑。瑪納特之理由，以貝當將軍在法國戰敗之時，猶居要職，專持勢力，換言之，其時貝當之所以得勢，實法國戰敗所致。同時瑪氏聲稱，渠將於開審時召喚十五名見證人。</p>

<h3>浙江新形勢</h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者　湯毅</p>
<p>浙江屹立在和平區的前端，無論在軍事·政治·經濟各方面，環境特別複雜，幾年以來，誠所謂萑苻遍地，勒索橫行，物資日缺，民生艱窘。面臨着許多困難問題的歷來浙江主政當局，莫不深感洽絲益棼之苦。自從國府調整人事，强化地方長官陳容以後，項前省長以軍人的姿態出現，率領所部來浙，拓展了浙西轄區的範圍，奠定了治安上的基礎。最近丁墨邨氏，出主浙政，一秉其沉着切實的作風與豐富的從政經騐，就培養戰力，恢復交通，增加生產，確立治安，解除民間疾苦諸端，大刀闊斧的幹去。自從六月十一日接任以來，僅在一個月餘的短時期中，對於省政已有顯著的進步，面目一新。記者此番來浙觀光，爰就行政·建設·敎育各方面，略作介紹，以見新生浙江的一斑。</p>
<p>訪問民廳</p>
<p>首先訪問的，是民政廳長張鵑　氏。張氏在廿九年時，便任浙省府委員，主持過嘉興方面的淸鄕工作，深悉浙省情形，又因為在國府選都之初，曾在丁默邨統率之下，担任過社會福利工作，所以此次丁氏出主浙省，就由張氏負責民政重任。一方面固然是駕輕就熟，另方面在執行丁氏政策上說，也得指臂相輔之效。</p>
<p>張氏有個方方的同字形的臉，身材巍偉，一望而知是個實幹的人物。記者首先叩詢民廳的施政方針，張氏說：</p>
<p>「丁省長的治浙方針，就民政方面說，第一是提高縣長職權，第二是加强保甲與自衛，亦即是健全民衆組織，諸如區鄕鎭長地方行政幹部之嚴格訓練。</p>
<p>「過去縣長因為事權不集中，不能指揮各局，欲求充分發展其才能，有所建樹，當然很困難。省府正在計劃提高其職權，今後各縣的局長如警察，財政，敎育諸局長，都將由各該縣長推薦任命，如此，不但容易合作，指揮上也方便不少。」</p>
<p>記者插口問起丁省長就任後對於縣長人選的更動，張氏回答說：「更動的不多；海寗縣長是因故撤職，其他杭縣，崇德，德淸三縣，略有調動。」</p>
<p>張氏接着又說：「除了以上所說兩點外，諸如推行中央頒佈的國民義務勞動法，普遍社會福利事業，提倡節約運動等等，也在民廳執黨範圍之內，而擬着手進行的。」</p>
<p>治區範圍</p>
<p>記者要求張氏對於目前浙省管轄區域，加以說明，張氏站起來，指着身後的壁上地圖說，「浙江省目前分為七個行政區：第一區以杭縣為中心，第二區以吳興為中心，第三區以嘉興為中心，第四區以海寗為中心。以上四區，便是所謂浙西。浙東方面，有以紹興為中心的第五區，以寗波為中心的第六區，以金華為中心的第七區。目前，僅僅第七區方面，亦即是說金華，　谿，義烏，浦江，東陽方面，因為軍事環境的關係，政務尙無法推行。亦即說，原來的三十五個縣中間，有五個縣縣政，目前事實上在停頓之中。」</p>
<p>記者要求對金華方面的情形，予以更詳細的說明，張氏非常坦白，就軍事上的形勢，需要，剖析得異常淸晰，除了不須發表的以外，簡略說起來，大槪情形如次：</p>
<p>為了適應戰局，今後浙贛路方面情形也許有些變動，但就最低限度講，寗波紹興蕭山至杭州為止，這一條浙東沿錢塘江的交通綫，無論鐵道，公路，必可確保。目前金華城內，仍有盟邦軍隊駐紥。諸曁方面，政令可完全推行。記者問起滬上有金華撤防的謠傳，張氏的談話，證明完全不確，說：「義烏的縣長，昨天便是從那方面來的。」</p>
<p>據說，浙西形勢，最近大為改善。這因為是治安力量加强的緣故。過去駐紥蘇北的幾個師，自從移防浙西後，兩年來困擾於游匪的武康·德淸·富陽諸縣，已逐步在恢復。德淸縣府，偏安於新市鎭上已經一兩年了，最近擬搬回縣城去。長興吳興方面的新四軍，有暫時移退到天目山方面的現象，浙西的共軍，一部分到浙東去了。記者談起太湖治安問題，張氏說：「就過去經騐談，非江浙兩省同時協力不為功。」</p>
<p>浙西形勢</p>
<p>記者在候謁丁省長時，會客室中遇到回省報吿的武康縣長韓鈞，匆忙之間曾一談浙西的軍事形勢。據韓縣長所談，浙西渝共衝突得很激烈。過去該方面駐紥的渝軍有七十九師，六十九師，一百〇二師等，其中七十九師被新四軍繳械，新四軍在武康方面便有七八千人，番號是「第四集」，有　　的大砲，有力，因此渝方派了五個師，號稱反共同盟軍，由　覺指揮，在安吉　豐一帶對新四軍展開攻勢。渝軍與國軍間相安無事。韓縣長說起這一點，臉上浮着微笑。</p>
<p>武康情形，據說以往轄境極小，人民因去年鬧新四軍，走避一空，居民祗賸十八個，從前的縣長從沒到任過。現在轄區日漸擴展，已佔全縣面積三分之一，下轄三區，十三鄕三十三保，有一萬多人口了。現有警察約一百人，有六十支槍，並有盟軍駐紥。預料一個月內，政令可以推廣到縣境三分之二。當地出產山貨如竹木茶葉，向經蘇州嘉興銷往上海。七月十日的米價，每老斛一石是五十五萬。（七月十三日發）</p>

<h3>中儲檢金處繼續檢查　行莊不良營業　金融機關正當業務協力扶助</h3>
<p>中央儲備銀行檢査金融事務處，爲取締現鈔貼水，此次檢査各金融機關，發覺三十五家銀行錢莊嫌犯管理金融機關業務法令，經營非法業務，奉財政部令，於日前執行吊銷水康等五家銀行　　執照，錦德等十一家銀行錢莊暫行停止營業，　將內部堅理完善後，呈部核准再行復　，中國惠民等十九家銀行錢莊因情節較輕，分別處以罰金，以上吊銷執照暫　營業十六家行莊，均已遵奉檢金處頒布之淸算及整理辦法辦理淸整手續。茲據中儲檢金處消息，其他各銀行錢莊，有無同樣行爲，今後決繼續不斷嚴密檢查，以期肅淸不良營業，協力穩定金融。唯對於金融機關正當業務，確屬困難情形，中儲決當協力扶助。</p>
<h3>限制行荘轉賬申請</h3>
<p>中儲檢金處爲協力調劑金融機關，運用　金，防止取巧　幣，對於銀行聯合　　委員會，與錢業　準備庫會員行莊，轉賬中　書規定限制辦法，凡屬會員行莊轉　申請書，均作當日轉賬資金，惟非會員行莊之業外往來戶轉　申請，不在此例。聞中儲　金處即將函飭銀錢兩業會庫，査照辦理。</p>
<h3>多數行莊寬放支現</h3>
<p>中央儲備銀行以現鈔需要孔殷，對於銀　兩業所屬各銀行錢莊支付客戶之現鈔頭寸，近已逐步增加，務期超出百分之二十以上。據悉，已有若干歷史悠久行莊多家，深明當局解決現鈔之意義，乃向中　依存款數字比率所領到之現鈔，均盡量用於各存戶支取現鈔用途，不獨已滿足百分之二十付予現鈔，且有多家已自動放竟至百分之三十支付現鈔之比率，即存入一百萬元，每週可支付現鈔三十萬元。至於故意短少規鈔於客戶，或將現款輾轉牟要貼現暴利之各銀行錢莊，則猶未絕跡。</p>
<h3>本市上周間　金融工商市況　烚赤交易轉移金證劵市場</h3>
<p>滬市金融與工商各業市况，最近一週復起動　，上半週趨勢尚穩堅，下半　　動突烈，人心振奮，擁資者吸收甚股，散戶亦跟隨買進，烚赤現貨交易大都轉移金證券市塲。</p>
<h3>金劵</h3>
<p>週一週二金券市面呈漲尚穩，各方吸意殊淡，蓋話傳五期　證券發行期迫，靜待所價掛牌。週三市傳新價將掛高，到期券與四期券微見小漲。週四突以五期金券延期發行，掉券者以奇貨可居，加以無稽　言　惑人心，買風突熾，掀起高價尚難打倒買戶吸力，到期與四期金券每十兩衝出四千萬元大關，週五繼續　升，週六漲勢仍未壓平，續漲二十餘萬元一兩，最高價會達四千三百二十萬元十兩。紋銀及公債隨金價瘋狂暴漲，紋銀每兩達二萬二千元。</p>
<h3>華股</h3>
<p>華股週一週二漲跌忽見，週三因傳說五期金證券發行關係，人心萎　，股價脚地軟弱，資戶欲　價不能。週四證明金券　發，游資　而無用，買風復起，一般多頭得悉萬元大票發行，傾力吸進，三熱門股及中小型普遍上漲，週五面，開市漲風仍熾，旋因多頭見利傾售，散戶乃感恐慌，爭相脫手，始見供過於求，市呈狂退，大中小型股均轉回小，惟脚地尚穩。</p>
<p>內中　極力設法消除現鈔恐慌增加現金籌碼，並奉部令執行懲處非法營業之三十五家行莊，其中有十餘家停止營業，唯一此種金融機關之轉變不足影響整個金融市面。</p>
<h3>物價</h3>
<p>至於一周問工商各業方面尚無顯著變動，主要商品各業工廠最近將得電力供給，準備恢復一部份生產，惟各業公司商號大都藉詞生產原料成本加重，及一一切生活費提高，紛紛擅自增高價格，如棉織品。絲織品，肥皂，火財，洋燭，柴炭，油糖等類，漲勢均厲，幸米　及雜糧粉麥等類。市價尚稱平穩。</p>
<h3>電車今日起　再度增價</h3>
<p>上海都市交通公司，呈請建設部再行調整該於司管理之各都市公共汽車及本市有　軌電車　，頃巳接奉部令核准，定於今（十六）日起實行。關於電車之車資新價口如下：　普通車資一律　　五　元，軍人劵五○元。　月季劵全　，成人七萬元，幼童三萬五千元。　月季券單綫，成人三萬元，幼童一萬五千元，同時本市法商管理之有無　電車車資，亦照都市交通公司調整新優格比例　增。</p>
<h3>行駛時間或將延長</h3>
<p>又據該公司方面消息：該公司對於維持本市電車之行駛，已　最大努力，關於電車行駛時間，準備設法延長，所需之電力，已與有關當局在協議，目前煤　問題已好轉，是以電車行駛時間將有延長可能，如獲實行，則本市交通當可專　圓滑。</p>

<p>在我國國民中，不乏愛好科學之事，彼等苦幹之精神，亦並不　於他國之學者，所惜者彼等　因未　賞　，獨力難支，以致力　一　，中道而　。今若助以資金，供給所需，則彼等必將　續忠科學，以達成功。果能一旦發明一物，或閘明一理，豈個之譽而已，誠國家社會之　也。</p>
<p>回憶去夏，本報亦曾　辦科學獎金，惟因社會人士未予熱烈協助，不久即告消沉無開，　憾事也。今後如請市府主辦，較爲有力，况目前市府已設文化委員會，獎勵戰時學術研究，則科學輔助獎金一事，自可請該委員會號理。但科學硏究與其他學術研究略有不同，故在評定成績時，不能一視同仁一，茲擇主要不問點如左，以供參考：</p>
<p>普通學術硏究可於工作結果之報告文稿上，評定取捨，獨科學硏究不然，應就硏究之目的，及方法步驟上，評決高下。何也？凡硏究科學者大半不能終其目的，僅能選其畢生工作之所得，待後人接　，故其目的雖未達，然其功績實不可沒。</p>
<p>科學研究即以方法步驟爲重，則主管機關當應派員監察獲獎者工作之巡行，隨時予以指導及各種便利，同時獲獎者亦須按時向主管機關具體記錄，報告工作之現況。</p>
<p>各國政府對於科學技術人員，向來加以保護，故爲配植國力起見，市府對於獲獎者之最低生活應於維持，傳可安心工作</p>
<p>在此科學時代之中，我兩實不容再行遲延，亟宜栽植科學幹部人才，以　定未來我國新文化之基礎。</p>

<h3>被處分各行莊　代表人的責任問題</h3>
<p>— 和生</p>
<p>這次負責金融當局，以大公無私的態度，嚴厲處分三十五家遠法行莊，誠是震動社會，大快人心之事。嗣後行莊引以爲戒，知趨謹愼者固不乏人，而待事過境遷，復萌故態者定椱不少。因此除請當局榴績烙外注意行莊今後動態外，爲求更形澈底計，乃對此次被處分行莊之態事，生有下列感想：</p>
<p>按董事乃公司（行莊亦屬公司）對外之代表人，對內之主持人，執有公司最高全權處理一切內外事務之全責，董事之優劣，直接影響於公司甚大，金融檢查處有鑒於斯，乃於強化金融一令中，規定董事長不得兼職經理，期達專任職事，不致貽誤之意。詎料本月十二日各報戰，行莊竟有溢發票據，貼水圖利，偽造帳目，囤積投機之量大遠法行爲而被處分，竞多至三十五家。試問該行莊等之董事，究竟所司何事，以致遠法。若市民之有犯上列事項者，必得受法律之制裁，而此次對各行莊，僅由金融當局分別予上吊銷執照，停業，罰　之處分，並未計及其代表人，又係何故？</p>
<p>法人（公司）之遠法，是代表人行爲所成，故無論其爲本身，或屬下之行爲（代表公司之行爲）犯法，其爲代表人之董事，實難辭其咎。故深盼金融當局，更進而將關於上項濫發，偽造，囤積，投機等事實證伴，移送各有關當局，分別對於上述行莊之董事長，董事，予以澈查嚴處。最低限度，亦宜予以不得再任行莊之董事長，董事之規定。務使知所驚惕，安分從事，則金融安定，實利賴之。</p>
<h3>建議公會　設立公賣處</h3>
<p>— 慕</p>
<p>在過去不知有過幾次限價，每次限價的結果，都是造成了有價無貨的現象，後來漸漸一批一批的貨物都是從零售商的後門出來，於是在人行道上添了許多攤販，而他們的價格，却是自由決定，不受限價的限制。</p>
<p>例如：四六　草紙，原來限價每足刀一百三十二元，那時的　　却要二百元，現在更非一千五六百元買不到了，而原來的零售商則家家無貨應市。</p>
<p>這幾天報上又登出了一批一批的新限價，據報載這種新限價是由各公會建議，然後再經物價評議會核准公佈的，這當然是合理的價格，對於批發商及零售的利潤當然有了著落，照理應該處處都可買得到了。但是事實告訴我們，　了少數有特殊關係的人外，一般人民還是買不到照限價出售的物品。在「要，就買！不要，拉到！」的情形下，祇得　貨興歎，或忍痛贖買。</p>
<p>雖說有經濟警察在巡視，或可尚就近警局告發，但是有誰願意爲了買一刀草紙或半斤肉，去費許多口舌和時間，同時又引來許多意外的麻煩呢？所以一般人總是抱著「買得起就買，買不起就不買。」的　　，　答復：「要，就買，不要，拉到！」</p>
<p>我們的意思是既然有了限價，公會應該維持信用，政府也應該維持威信，一定要使每一個人，都能買得到貨。所以我們建議，如公會應該在市區各處，指定零售商爲公賣處，凡市民要買限價品都可到那兒去買。公賣處的貨品，由各公會　批發商供給，在限價有效期內，　量發售。這樣一來，經濟警察也有一定的地點，便於前去查察，人民也就不會受買不到限價品的痛苦，而限價也就可以成爲名副其實的限價了。</p>
<h3>評定物價我見</h3>
<p>— 甘斗南</p>
<p>査公定協定物價的評定，雖已由物價評委員會聲明，謂該會過去評價程序太繁，以致所評價格，每失時效，故今後改由同業公會擬定送會審核決定，但爲緊急處置之必要，得先由主任委員核定公佈施行，再提會追認，不必如以往拘泥於等待物價評議會的通過，庶　輾轉費時，失却時效之弊。惟此舉仍須等會方審査核准，需費相當時日，在市况平靜之時，固毋須顧慮，然際此變化倐忽，瞬息萬象之時，則雖短至數日之閣，亦必因環境條件的不同，而失却協定價格的原義；何况自同業公會評議後，送呈主管機關備案，以　　核批准的時間，又非數日內所能辦；故就目前一般日用商品仍舊不免有價無貨之感，勢必重行向黑市搜求，同時一般製浩商因格於限價與成本的差額，換言之即限價低於成本，勢必影響其生產程序，不無　礙物資流通，助長失業趨勢之嫌，其有礙於當局鼓勵生產施策，彰彰明甚。</p>
<p>欲求澈底消滅上項現像，鄙意以爲不論何種商品的協定價格，茍非得到官方配給原料的，最好將目前限價，姑予取消，一面强化同業公會之組織，一面給予賦予同業公會以較大之職榷和責任，即凡有變更價格必要時，得由同業公會負責，隨時據實評定售價，即可付諸實施，惟爲社絕商人利用職　，　取暴利的流弊起見，應由同業公會全體理監事，速名具結，將評價經過情形及所根據之原料成本表，送呈主管機關備案，設被發覺該公會確有虛報市價，企圖暴利證據時，可由主管機關，依照戰時法律，嚴　處分，則各同業公會負責人，自不敢以身試法，致干未便，對於非法企圖，亦必儘量避免。倘能如此實行，一方面旣可穩定物價，消減不法商人妄自抬價，一方面又可保障製造商，予以合法利潤，換言之，就是鼓勵生產，於是製造者不惜搜求原料，樂於生產，消費者不必再求諸黑市•管見如斯，質諸有　人仕，以爲然否？</p>
<h3>學校疏散後　學生應採工讀制</h3>
<p>— 仁眾</p>
<p>最近　月來，當局爲謀市民安全起見，決計實行疏散人口，並就　　機關最先實行，　後再疏散　　　　　　善　　散，　須提　　領，尚無，誠有力不從心之感！</p>
<p>如疏散學校本身，而不同時疏散學生，顯屬虛有疏散之名。若使學生，　裝同赴疏散　　　　　下列之困難：　學生家長是否滿意？　學生家長即使願意，則學生　　之費，农着之需，學生家長能否負擔？</p>
<p>上列兩袖困難之原因，　者可由當局曉以時勢：「滬上人　多，食糧缺乏，易受空　危險。學生旅學他鄕，與鄕村機實風氣接近，對於道德身心，兩有　益。」若非溺愛　理之家長，無有不從者</p>
<p>然後者之困難，非大量財力物資支持不易解決。蓋學生家長，恐未必皆有　養子女於外埠就學之能力。則疏散學校之實施將待何時？</p>
<p>故「學校疏散」此一嚴重問題，唯有通報計劃，在外埠選擇宜於籌備工讀學校之地城，力求「求，則方不　衣食之憂，而　弦歌之聲。</p>
<p>當此「增產第一」的時代，已不容許任何一個國民優游歲月，如果　　着享樂的成見，醉生夢死，那末他們這般公子小姐是甘願做社會國家的蛀虫。（如最近有大學生發起之派對等，吾人已不忍　之也！）我們再看世界各國，那一國的學生不在　頭苦幹，預備爲國家效力。學校疏散後，採取「工讀制」以補消費上的缺　，在現在上一個最好的辦法。</p>
<p>至於工讀學校，學科宜就該校本身性質發展。或工，或農，總宜時因地，相機而行，然必須適合下列條件：</p>
<p>不妨　學生身心之健康。</p>
<p>力求隨便，能於短期間即能生產者。</p>
<p>如工業則務使學生　業後繼續生產，仍爲社會所必須者。</p>
<p>上海市政當局，除應　選辦理工　敎育專　州人　外，於疏散的交通方面，極力　助，務使便利。並懇請該學校所在地區行政當局，加以保護，對於該「續學校」所需之　宇，於可能　圍內最法，如廟宇等暫作學校或工塲，農出等代爲租貨，對工　學校之出品，予以免稅　出等之優待。</p>
<p>至於經費方面，除了開辦時向學生家長徵集部份外，缺額尚希市政當局，或向興學愛國的豪富勸募，使得疏散後的學校，依然有蓬勃的生氣，或者竟能使「畢業即失業」的現象，稱爲陳績。</p>

<h3>Hokkaido Area Base Harbor Suffers First Air Raid Yesterday; Enemy Warships Shell Area Near Kamaishi</h3>
<p>Japanese Imperial Headquarters Announcement</p>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:30 PM on the 14th: Enemy carrier-based aircraft attacked our air bases and harbors in the Tohoku region and southern Hokkaido several times on the morning of the 14th. On the same day at noon, a portion of enemy warships echoed this, conducting naval bombardments near Kamaishi.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - On the morning of the 14th, carrier-based aircraft from enemy mobile forces attacked the Tohoku region and southern Hokkaido. On the morning of the 15th at around 6:00 AM, a portion of a mobile force composed of battleships, cruisers, destroyers, etc., attacked Hokkaido and the Tohoku region. Simultaneously, a portion of an enemy mobile force composed of battleships and cruisers conducted naval bombardment of factory facilities in the Muroran area of Hokkaido from 9:00 PM to 10:00 PM.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - The enemy mobile force had previously suffered continuous fierce attacks from Japanese special attack units in the Okinawa sea area, losing approximately half of its aircraft carrier strength. However, they subsequently exerted great effort in re-equipping. At dawn on the 10th, a mobile force composed of more than ten aircraft carriers, etc., approached the Japanese mainland southeast of the Kanto region, launching approximately 1,200 carrier-based aircraft to attack Japanese air bases in various parts of Kanto throughout the day. Afterwards, due to weather and other reasons, they immediately withdrew from our sphere of influence in the eastern sea, awaiting an opportunity to attack. On the 14th, they approached the mainland again, attacking Japanese air bases and harbors in the Tohoku region and southern Hokkaido with carrier-based aircraft. Simultaneously, a portion of their warships echoed this, conducting naval bombardments in the Kamaishi area. It is noted that this is the first time enemy carrier-based aircraft have attacked Tohoku and Hokkaido, and they simultaneously conducted naval bombardments. However, we cannot consider this naval bombardment as the first step towards landing. The enemy's execution of this type of naval bombardment is merely a diversionary tactic, and there is currently no intention to land. Therefore, the enemy's air raid on the Tohoku and Hokkaido regions is to expand the operational range of B-29 aircraft based in the Mariana Islands. At the same time, the enemy aims to destroy Japanese air power. Therefore, the enemy mobile force is accompanied by oil tankers, enabling it to operate independently for two to three weeks. Based on this observation, it is feared that enemy carrier-based aircraft will continue to attack the mainland coast in the future, and their naval guns may continue to bombard coastal areas.</p>
<h3>War Situation in Various Parts of East Asia</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - The war situation in various parts of East Asia for the past week is as follows: From the perspective of the movements of enemy base air power, the forces in the Mariana Islands have been dispersed this week, with a tendency for simultaneous air raids in multiple locations. P-51 and PB4Y aircraft from Iwo Jima attacked airfields in the Tokai Naval District and laid mines to blockade various ports along the Japanese mainland coast. Regarding the movements of enemy air power in the Okinawa area, they have gradually advanced and strengthened their bases on the main island. Medium-sized aircraft and night fighters have appeared, attacking airfields in the Kyushu area, and it is expected that this will become even more intensified in the future. At the same time, the enemy must mobilize a large number of ships and pour in huge amounts of materials, making the special attack aviation center, which is the center of air power, the focus of their operations, launching attacks every day, inflicting great damage on the enemy. Japanese forces in the Philippines continue to use the Cagayan Valley in northern Luzon as a base for counterattacks, engaging in active and courageous decisive battles. Due to continuous losses and sacrifices, the enemy ground forces have recently experienced a severe shortage of manpower, and have transferred the black troops of the 93rd and 13th Divisions to Cagayan in an attempt to reverse the decline. At the same time, the enemy air force in the Philippines has deployed part of its forces to attack Taiwan, another part to operations in Borneo, and the remaining half to Okinawa Island. From this, it can be seen that the enemy, who boasts of air power, is finding it difficult to allocate air force resources to all areas as the theater of war continues to expand. In Borneo, both sides are in a standoff in various regions such as Tarakan, Balikpapan, and Brunei. Japanese forces in Miri are intensifying their attacks in various locations, especially fierce battles are being waged northwest of Balikpapan to block the enemy's advance. However, the enemy's intentions are extremely stubborn, and they continue to reinforce their forces on the front line, urgently seeking to advance. On Ternate Island, as of July 12th, Japanese garrison troops were pressing the landing enemy forces towards the north, inflicting heavy attacks. In the Indian Ocean, although the activities of the British fleet are gradually showing a tendency to become more active, on July 5th and 6th, enemy naval forces again invaded the Nicobar Islands, stirring up trouble in the northern and southern parts of Kamorta and the western parts of Kotara, and on the 11th, a mobile force including two aircraft carriers launched 200 carrier-based aircraft in an attack. The war situation in the Pacific is such that the enemy's ambition for resource zones in the south is becoming increasingly evident, and their future movements should be closely monitored.</p>
<h3>Polish Priest Talks About Japan's Decisive Battle Situation</h3>
<p>Zurich, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to a French news agency dispatch from Helsinki, seven Polish priests who returned from Japan a month ago and are staying in Helsinki, spoke about the situation of the decisive battle in Japan as follows: Although many Japanese citizens have suffered damage from bombing, not a single one has succumbed to the air raids, and everyone's belief remains firm, with no fear. They believe that victory will belong to Japan no matter how long the war is prolonged. Although Japan's food situation is quite difficult, everything that can be obtained within the realm of possibility is distributed fairly. We, as travelers in Japan, are not restricted in any way.</p>

<h3>Renewing the Plea for Needy and Outstanding Students</h3>
<p>Since the launch of our newspaper's scholarship fund campaign, it has gone through eight sessions. Although we cannot say that it has been a great success, thanks to the enthusiasm of our readers for education, their active assistance, and their generous donations, quite a few needy and outstanding students have been rescued from the sea of lost education in these past few years. Other good deeds are done without expecting reward, and in reality, it is impossible to conduct a thorough investigation. However, the scholarship campaign is different. Donating more money means rescuing more students. Their academic performance, character, and grades can all be investigated, which directly and indirectly benefits society and the nation. Therefore, we have previously proposed the slogan "Helping with education is the greatest good, helping with education is the greatest joy," proving that this kind of good deed is especially worthy of praise and commendation.</p>
<p>On the recent launch date of the ninth scholarship fundraising campaign, we published an article titled "Pleading for Needy Students," hoping that our readers would make their best efforts, donate generously, actively solicit donations, and contribute together. The amount of money raised in this scholarship fundraising campaign exceeds the previous sessions by a huge amount, which also means that expectations for benefactors from all walks of life are particularly urgent. Therefore, we find it necessary to reiterate our views by renewing our plea to all sectors for the benefit of needy and outstanding students. Why is this so? The current social and national environment is at a turning point. Regardless of whether the environment is good or bad, the economic situation of middle- and lower-class citizens is extremely difficult. Maintaining their livelihoods has already become a great challenge, and they have to put their children's education in second place. As a result, tens of thousands of outstanding students are forced to drop out of school, wandering the streets, struggling for survival and losing their education for the sake of food. If this situation is allowed to continue, what kind of serious impact will it have on China's political and cultural aspects in the future? Therefore, we must not only continue to hold the old student scholarship campaign so that students who have previously benefited from social scholarships will not drop out of school, but also decide to selectively accept new students so that outstanding young people who were previously able to support themselves but are now about to drop out of school will also have the opportunity to receive social benefits and continue to complete their studies.</p>
<p>In order to achieve this ideal of rescuing outstanding young people who are dropping out of school for the country and society, the estimated fundraising target is 30 million yuan based on the lowest estimates. For the convenience of fundraising, it is divided into two types: honorary teams with at least 1 million yuan per team, and ordinary teams with at least 100,000 yuan per team. However, because there is only a little over a month left before the start of the next semester, we hope to reach this goal within one month, which means that at least 10 million yuan must be raised per day. In order to express our sincerity and determination in this regard, our newspaper and our colleagues, although being the most impoverished cultural enterprise and cultural workers, will first pledge two honorary teams ourselves, hoping that those who are richer than us can donate generously, and those who are the same as us do not need to be discouraged, and can pool their resources to establish one or several teams.</p>
<p>However, the total amount of donations received is only over 13 million yuan, which is too far from the expected goal! Thinking of the tens of thousands of young people who are eagerly awaiting scholarships to continue their studies, every one of our staff members cannot help but shed tears! Looking back at the donations in the past ten days, in addition to a small number of enthusiastic donors who donated the total amount, most of them saved on birthday celebrations or festival expenses, and transferred the cash gifts from relatives and friends to help. This is a very commendable good deed. However, we hope that people with relatively more generous economic conditions will donate generously, pledge or raise several honorary teams, and break our previous scholarship records. Secondly, the Zhongshi Tennis Club held a scholarship tennis match this time, and the results were excellent, which shows that there are many people who are happy to do good. In the future, we hope that enthusiasts from all walks of life will use various methods to complete our scholarship campaign. At the same time, we also sincerely hope that all the great benefactors who have enthusiastically solicited and donated funds in the past will continue their efforts, donate generously, so that people and those who care about scholarship undertakings can laugh through their tears as soon as possible, and sing praises for thousands of students!</p>
<h3>The Attitude That Should Be Had in Wartime Life</h3>
<p>Under the frequent attacks of enemy aircraft, the lives of people in the Japanese mainland are inevitably affected to a considerable extent. Many innocent civilians have lost their homes and property under indiscriminate bombing, causing a lot of inconvenience in their lives. Therefore, some ignorant people even complain about the hardship of life. It is a common human weakness to reveal an unbearable mood when encountering adversity. However, victory is just around the corner, as long as you know how to fight for it. Therefore, a reporter from the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper went to ask the Abbot Watanabe Genryu Zenji of Sojiji Temple in Tsurumi (a suburb of Tokyo) about the attitude towards wartime life. The conversation is as follows:</p>
<p>Practice Self-Reflection</p>
<p>(Question) Recently, I often hear people talk about the decline of national morality, etc. What are the abbot's views on this?</p>
<p>(Answer) Yes, I have heard it too, but I don't think so. Even under the stress of life, people's hearts can still conform to morality. If you reflect for five or ten minutes a day, you won't overstep the mark.</p>
<p>(Question) However, the self-reflection that Zen masters talk about is related to education. Isn't it too difficult for ordinary people to reflect on their own?</p>
<p>(Answer) Yes. Education is wisdom. Knowledge is the substance of things, and wisdom is its operation, just like the relationship between a candle and its candlelight. There can also be a standard for judging the overall situation. It may be unreasonable to ask ordinary people to reflect on their own, but isn't there politics?</p>
<p>Improve National Morality</p>
<p>(Question) Even if national morality has not fallen, isn't the decline in national morality sufficient to affect the war?</p>
<p>(Answer) There are many cases in history where wars have failed due to the collapse of the rear. Therefore, the national moral compass indeed has a great effect on the execution of war, and we must find a way to improve it. However, the moral compass of our people is definitely not lower than that of Britain and the United States. Of course, generally speaking, the British and American people are rich in common sense, but their connection with the moral compass is not correct. If the investigation of things is not thorough, then one will be confined by things. Not being confined by things and not being bound by reason is the ultimate state of Zen. Regarding Germany's failure, the Germans were too confident in the power of science, which led to them being too subjective about things and tending to ignore their objective operations. Therefore, once they were defeated, they lost confidence. As a result, the weakness was exposed.</p>
<p>(Question) Like the moral compass, will the problem of food also depress the morale of the people?</p>
<p>(Answer) Today, we only ask to fill our stomachs, and even coarse food is okay. If we have such a mentality regarding the food problem, then there is nothing to worry about. Those who become depressed without delicacies are better off dead. I have been accustomed to coarse food since I was a child, and today's rations are very good to me. Of course, I am not asking everyone to be like me, but we should all be patient.</p>
<p>(Question) What are your thoughts on the B-29 bomber raids?</p>
<p>Should Be Calm During Air Raids</p>
<p>(Answer) I have no other thoughts. I had expected today's events from the beginning of the war. However, the strange thing is that some people panic when their houses are destroyed. People are bound to die. When you die, you can't take anything with you. As long as you don't die, what's so bad about burning down your house! The day before yesterday, my relative came to me and said that his house was destroyed and there was nothing to eat. Seeing that he was young, he said such unambitious words, which made me so angry. So I also said to him impolitely: You can also live in an air-raid shelter, and you can eat weeds! During the air raid on the 25th night, in the fireworks, I heard the roar of the B-29 flying overhead, which was really the roar of the devil! It was the devil's heart hidden under the mask of peace. Therefore, if we don't subdue it, true peace is definitely hopeless.</p>
<p>Special Attack Units and the Japanese Spirit</p>
<p>(Question) What are your thoughts on the special attack units?</p>
<p>(Answer) Ah, there are no appropriate words to praise them! The special attack units are the concrete expression of the Japanese spirit. Therefore, I think that all Japanese people can become special attack units in an emergency. Isn't this a strength of the Japanese spirit? Two or three days ago, I went to Tokyo and looked out the window of the train at the coastal situation. I only saw smoke coming from the houses. However, I deeply believe that the Japanese people will definitely rise from this scorched earth. From now on, we can only take out our true strength! (Translated from Mainichi Shimbun)</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft in Small Formations Attack Kyushu Area; Japanese Air Defense Unit Crashes Two of Them</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - Approximately 40 enemy small aircraft from the Okinawa base attacked southern Kyushu around 2:00 PM on the 14th without any organization and left by 3:00 PM. Ten B-29s came to the Kyushu area around 0:00 AM on the 14th and dropped mines in the Kanmon area for an hour.

<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - A small number of enemy carrier-based aircraft formations attacked the Akita and Aomori areas around 8:00 AM on the 15th and strafed railroad facilities, harbors, and airfields for two hours.</p>
<p>Japanese Cargo Ship Shoots Down Enemy Aircraft</p>
<p>Aomori, 15th (Central News Agency) - A formation of carrier-based aircraft that took off from the enemy mobile force on the 14th attacked ships anchored in Aomori Port. At that time, a cargo ship quickly retreated immediately after receiving a warning that enemy aircraft were attacking. However, the cargo ship was finally discovered near Asamushi Beach by an enemy aircraft formation, which then attacked the ship. The cargo ship immediately returned fire and skillfully retreated in the smoke. Suddenly, an enemy aircraft spewed black smoke and fell. Then, another enemy aircraft was hit by anti-aircraft fire.

<h3>Political Upheaval in Chongqing People's Political Council</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 15th (Central News Agency) - Since the convening of the Chongqing National Political Council, the meeting has encountered considerable difficulties due to the issue of Yan'an's non-participation and opinions on holding a National Assembly. According to a United Press dispatch from Chongqing, Chiang Kai-shek's opening speech has also caused an uproar. Because a part of his speech was deleted by the review authorities, the council members believed that this measure was a clear insult to the National Political Council and seriously protested to the review authorities. The part of Chiang's speech that was not published until the 11th. It is said that the key point of the problem is the Chongqing-Yan'an dispute, from which it can be seen that the Chongqing-Yan'an dispute is deep and complex.</p>

<h3>Simla Conference Fails to Achieve Results; Conference Reopens on the Previous Day</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Simla, the Simla Conference, which has been suspended since the 29th of last month, resumed on the 14th. However, according to Wavell, the conference has already failed.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to news from the British capital: The Indian Affairs Bureau in London announced yesterday that the Simla Conference of Indian leaders convened by Lord Wavell, the Governor-General of India, ended without any achievement. The original text of the news said, "The British government announces that this Simla Conference convened to discuss the reform of Indian execution failed to reach an agreement between the Indian people and the British government, and ended without any achievement, which is a great regret." At the same time, Lord Wavell himself felt even more sorry for the failure of this conference.</p>
<h3>British Military Authorities Revoke Amity Ban on Germany</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to Reuters: General Montgomery officially announced yesterday the revocation of the "no friendship" ban on German troops and civilians, following in the footsteps of the Soviet military authorities.

Now, British troops in Germany and local adult German civilians can talk and interact." After the news was broadcast, it spread widely among the British and German troops and civilians in the Erfurt area.</p>
<h3>Joint Statement by Su and Yu: Both Sides Have Reached Understanding; Soong Tzu-wen and Entourage Speedily Return to Chongqing</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Stockholm, 15th - According to a Moscow dispatch, the Soviet government and the Yu side issued a joint statement on the 14th regarding the talks between Soong Tzu-wen and Stalin as follows: "The Soviet Union and Chongqing have held several talks over the past two weeks on various important issues in the relations between the two countries and have reached a mutual understanding. Chairman Stalin, being urgently required to go to Berlin to meet with Truman and Churchill, the talks have been temporarily suspended. Yu Executive Yuan President Soong Tzu-wen has set off to return to Yu, and the talks will be reopened in the near future."</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Stockholm, 15th - According to a Moscow dispatch: After six talks between Soong Tzu-wen and Chairman Stalin, Mr. Soong and his entourage departed from Moscow on the 14th and returned to Chongqing. Mr. Soong will report the results of this trip's talks to Chiang Kai-shek, discuss countermeasures, and plans to visit the Soviet Union again soon to continue talks. Furthermore, Moscow Radio, regarding these Yu-Soviet talks, stated that the two sides held talks in a harmonious atmosphere and have reached the goal of mutual understanding.</p>
<p>The Truth of the Talks Remains Unknown</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 15th - Stalin and Soong Tzu-wen's talks have reached five sessions, but the content of these talks has remained silent on both the Moscow and Chongqing sides, so the full truth cannot be known. Only British and neutral country newspapers have reported that the Soviet talks sought cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in order to resolve the establishment of a coalition government and delineate the status of Outer Mongolia. Moscow and Chongqing's opinions were difficult to reconcile, and it is expected that Soong Tzu-wen's negotiations face considerable difficulties. According to the "Observation Daily" commentary on the 8th, in the Moscow talks, the Yu side has the United States as a backer, but the Soviet Union does not want US concern to be concentrated in Chongqing. Although the Soviet Union's influence is limited to the Yan'an area, its intentions for China policy hope that China will achieve a unified coalition government with friendly relations with the Soviet Union. At the same time, the Kuomintang leaders have not paid attention to the Communist Party's proposed construction of a coalition government, and the Communist Party has also refused to send representatives to attend the National Political Council, thus leading to the rupture between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party today. If Soong Tzu-wen cannot break through this difficulty, he will lose Chiang Kai-shek's trust. Moreover, the purpose of the Moscow meeting is not only the Kuomintang-Communist issue alone. In short, if this issue cannot be resolved, the talks will lose their meaning. Furthermore, "The National Daily" speculated on the participation of Outer Mongolian Prime Minister Choibalsan in the Stalin-Soong meeting, stating that the talks only discussed the status of Outer Mongolia, but the Soviet government will never agree to the reintegration of the Outer Mongolian Republic into Chinese territory. If the Soviet Union can stop entering Xinjiang, Chongqing might be prepared to sacrifice Outer Mongolia, but that remains to be seen.</p>
<h3>British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Invited to Warsaw</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch - According to TASS, Warsaw: British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, at the invitation of Polish Parliament Chairman Bolesław Bierut, arrived in Warsaw on July 12th. Welcoming Sir Archibald at the Warsaw airport were the chairman's personal representative, representatives from various countries' governments to Poland, and representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<h3>Three Key Fascist Members Arrested</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch - According to TASS, Rome: Rome Radio broadcast news from Florence stating that important Fascist Party members Spadini and Golemi have been arrested by local authorities and will soon be tried in the Supreme Court. At the same time, news has confirmed that Blackshirt leader Bellinelli has been arrested by the local police station and will be tried in the Supreme Court of Florence.</p>
<h3>Lawyer Argues: Pétain Should Be Sentenced to Death</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 15th - According to news from Paris: French defense lawyer Maître Fernand Payen, considering that former Vichy government head General Philippe Pétain will be tried on July 23rd, strongly advocated that Pétain be sentenced to death. Payen's reasoning is that General Pétain still held important positions and power during the defeat of France, in other words, Pétain's rise to power at the time was due to France's defeat. At the same time, Payen stated that he would summon fifteen witnesses at the start of the trial.</p>

<h3>New Situation in Zhejiang</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Tang Yi</p>
<p>Zhejiang stands at the forefront of the peace zone. Whether in military, political, or economic aspects, the environment is particularly complex. In recent years, it has truly been a case of bandits everywhere, rampant extortion, daily shortages of supplies, and difficult living conditions for the people. Facing many difficult problems, the successive Zhejiang authorities have deeply felt the suffering of untangling knotted silk. Since the National Government adjusted personnel and strengthened the local leader Chen Rong, the former provincial governor appeared in the posture of a soldier, leading his troops to Zhejiang, expanding the scope of the western Zhejiang territory, and laying the foundation for security. Recently, Ding Mocun took charge of Zhejiang's administration, adhering to his calm and pragmatic style and rich political experience, focusing on cultivating combat power, restoring transportation, increasing production, establishing security, and relieving the people's suffering. Since taking office on June 11th, in just over a month's short period, there has been significant progress in provincial administration, and the appearance has been renewed. This time, the reporter came to Zhejiang to visit and will briefly introduce aspects of administration, construction, and education to show a glimpse of the new Zhejiang.</p>
<p>Visiting the Department of Civil Affairs</p>
<p>The first visit was to Zhang Juan, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs. Mr. Zhang served as a member of the Zhejiang Provincial Government in 1940, presiding over the cleansing work in Jiaxing, and deeply understood the situation in Zhejiang. Furthermore, because he worked under Ding Mocun's leadership in social welfare work at the beginning of the National Government's selection of the capital, Ding appointed Mr. Zhang to take charge of the important task of civil affairs when he took charge of Zhejiang. On the one hand, he was skilled at what he did, and on the other hand, in implementing Ding's policies, he could assist each other.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang has a square face and a towering figure. At first glance, he is a pragmatic person. The reporter first asked about the Department of Civil Affairs' policy guidelines. Mr. Zhang said:</p>
<p>"Director Ding's policy for governing Zhejiang, from the perspective of civil affairs, is first to increase the authority of county magistrates, and second to strengthen Baojia and self-defense, which is to improve public organizations, such as the strict training of district, township, and town leaders and local administrative cadres.</p>
<p>"In the past, county magistrates could not command the various bureaus because their authority was not concentrated, and it was naturally very difficult to fully develop their talents and make achievements. The provincial government is planning to increase their authority. In the future, the heads of various county bureaus, such as police, finance, and education, will be recommended and appointed by the county magistrates. This will not only make it easier to cooperate but also more convenient to command."</p>
<p>The reporter interrupted to ask about the changes in the selection of county magistrates after Governor Ding took office. Mr. Zhang replied, "There are not many changes; the Haiyan county magistrate was dismissed for reasons, and there were slight adjustments in Hangxian, Chongde, and Deqing counties."</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang then said, "In addition to the two points mentioned above, such as promoting the National Mandatory Labor Law promulgated by the central government, popularizing social welfare undertakings, and promoting the conservation movement, etc., are also within the scope of the Department of Civil Affairs' work, and we plan to start work on them."</p>
<p>Territorial Scope</p>
<p>The reporter asked Mr. Zhang to explain the current area under the jurisdiction of Zhejiang Province. Mr. Zhang stood up and pointed to the map on the wall behind him, saying, "Zhejiang Province is currently divided into seven administrative regions: the first region is centered on Hang County, the second region is centered on Wuxing, the third region is centered on Jiaxing, and the fourth region is centered on Haiyan. The above four regions are called western Zhejiang. In eastern Zhejiang, there is the fifth region centered on Shaoxing, the sixth region centered on Ningbo, and the seventh region centered on Jinhua. At present, only the seventh region, that is to say, Jinhua, Zhuji, Yiwu, Pujiang, and Dongyang, cannot be pushed forward because of the military environment. In other words, out of the original thirty-five counties, the county administration of five counties is currently in a state of standstill."</p>
<p>The reporter asked for a more detailed explanation of the situation in Jinhua. Mr. Zhang was very frank and analyzed the military situation and needs very clearly. Apart from what did not need to be published, the general situation was roughly as follows:</p>
<p>In order to adapt to the war situation, the situation on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Road may change in the future, but at the very least, the transportation line in eastern Zhejiang along the Qiantang River from Ningbo, Shaoxing, Xiaoshan to Hangzhou, whether railway or highway, must be ensured. Currently, there are still allied troops stationed in Jinhua City. In Zhuji, government orders can be fully implemented. The reporter asked about rumors in Shanghai that Jinhua was withdrawing its defenses. Mr. Zhang's conversation proved that this was completely untrue, saying, "The Yiwu county magistrate came from that area yesterday."</p>
<p>It is said that the situation in western Zhejiang has greatly improved recently. This is because the security forces have been strengthened. Several divisions stationed in northern Jiangsu in the past have gradually recovered in Wukang, Deqing, and Fuyang counties, which have been troubled by bandits for two years since they moved to western Zhejiang. The Deqing County Government has been living in exile in the New City for one or two years, and recently plans to move back to the county seat. The New Fourth Army in Changxing and Wuxing has temporarily retreated to the Tianmu Mountain area. Some of the Communist forces in western Zhejiang have gone to eastern Zhejiang. The reporter talked about the security problem in Taihu Lake. Mr. Zhang said, "Based on past experience, it will not work without the simultaneous cooperation of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces."</p>
<p>Situation in Western Zhejiang</p>
<p>While the reporter was waiting to see Governor Ding, he met Han Jun, the Wukang county magistrate who was returning to the province to report. In a hurry, he talked about the military situation in western Zhejiang. According to County Magistrate Han, the conflict between the Yu army and the Communist army in western Zhejiang is very fierce. In the past, the Yu army stationed in that area included the 79th Division, the 69th Division, and the 102nd Division, among which the 79th Division was disarmed by the New Fourth Army. The New Fourth Army in Wukang had seven or eight thousand people, with the title "Fourth Collection". They had powerful cannons and were powerful. Therefore, the Yu side sent five divisions, known as the Anti-Communist Allied Army, commanded by Zhao Jue, to launch an offensive against the New Fourth Army in the Anji area. The Yu army and the National army are on good terms. County Magistrate Han smiled as he talked about this.</p>
<p>It is said that Wukang used to have a very small territory. Because of the New Fourth Army last year, the people fled and there were only eighteen residents left. The former county magistrate had never taken office. Now the territory is gradually expanding, accounting for one-third of the county's area, with three districts, thirteen townships, thirty-three Bao, and more than 10,000 people under its jurisdiction. There are currently about 100 policemen with 60 guns and Allied troops stationed there. It is expected that within a month, government orders can be extended to two-thirds of the county. Local products such as mountain goods such as bamboo, wood, and tea are sold to Shanghai through Suzhou and Jiaxing.

<h3>Central Bank Gold Inspection Office Continues Inspection; Unsound Business Practices of Banks; Helping Financial Institutions with Legitimate Business</h3>
<p>The Central Reserve Bank's Financial Affairs Inspection Office, in order to crack down on premium cash, inspected various financial institutions this time and discovered that 35 banks and money shops were suspected of violating the laws and regulations on managing financial institutions and engaging in illegal business. Under the order of the Ministry of Finance, the licenses of five banks, including Shui Kang, were revoked a few days ago. Eleven banks and money shops, including Jin De, were temporarily suspended from business, and they will be allowed to resume business after internal management has been improved and reported to the Ministry for approval. Nineteen banks and money shops, including China Huimin, were fined for minor offenses. The 16 banks and money shops that have had their licenses revoked and temporarily suspended from business have all followed the liquidation and reorganization measures promulgated by the Central Bank Gold Inspection Office to carry out liquidation procedures. According to news from the Central Bank Gold Inspection Office, it will continue to conduct strict inspections in the future to eliminate unsound business practices and help stabilize finance. However, the Central Reserve Bank will help with legitimate businesses of financial institutions that are facing difficulties.</p>
<h3>Restrictions on Bank Transfer Applications</h3>
<p>In order to help regulate financial institutions and prevent fraud, the Central Bank Gold Inspection Office has formulated restrictions on the application for transfers from member banks of the Banking Joint Committee and the Money Industry Reserve. All transfer applications from member banks will be treated as transfer funds for the day, except for non-member banks' business-related transfers. It is heard that the Central Bank Gold Inspection Office will soon send a letter to the banking and money industry associations to investigate and handle the matter.</p>
<h3>Most Banks Loosen Cash Withdrawals</h3>
<p>The Central Reserve Bank, in view of the urgent need for cash, has recently gradually increased the cash limits for banks and money shops to pay customers, aiming to exceed 20%. It is understood that several long-established banks and money shops have deeply understood the significance of the authorities' solution to the cash problem, and have used the cash they received in proportion to the amount deposited in the Central Bank to the greatest extent possible for the purpose of withdrawing cash for various depositors. Not only have they met the 20% cash payment, but many have voluntarily increased it to 30%. That is, for every 1 million yuan deposited, 300,000 yuan of cash can be paid out per week. As for the banks and money shops that deliberately shortchange customers or transfer cash to seek exorbitant discounts, they have not disappeared.</p>
<h3>Financial, Industrial, and Commercial Conditions in the City Last Week; Hot Transactions Shift to the Gold and Securities Market</h3>
<p>The financial, industrial, and commercial conditions in Shanghai have rebounded in the past week. The trend was still stable in the first half of the week, but the fluctuations in the second half of the week were sudden and fierce. People were excited, and those with funds absorbed a large number of shares, and retail investors also followed suit, with most of the hot spot transactions shifting to the gold and securities market.</p>
<h3>Gold Securities</h3>
<p>The gold and securities market was stable and rising on Monday and Tuesday, and all parties showed little interest. It was said that the issuance period for the fifth phase of gold securities was approaching, and they were waiting for the listing price. On Wednesday, it was rumored that the new price would be high, and the expiring bonds and the fourth phase bonds saw a slight increase. On Thursday, it suddenly became apparent that the issuance of the fifth phase of gold securities was postponed, and those who released bonds took advantage of the scarcity, coupled with unfounded rumors confusing the people, and the buying trend suddenly became fierce. It was difficult to suppress the buying power even at high prices. The expiring and fourth phase gold bonds broke through the 40 million yuan mark per ten taels. The rising trend continued on Friday, and the rising momentum was still not flattened on Saturday, continuing to rise by more than 200,000 yuan per tael, with the highest price reaching 43.2 million yuan per ten taels. Silver and government bonds rose crazily with the price of gold, with silver reaching 22,000 yuan per tael.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks saw sudden ups and downs on Monday and Tuesday. On Wednesday, due to rumors about the issuance of the fifth phase of gold securities, people became disheartened and stock prices weakened. Investors wanted to sell but could not get a good price. On Thursday, it was proven that the gold bonds were postponed and idle funds were useless, and the buying trend rebounded. In general, the bulls learned that the 10,000-yuan notes were issued and invested heavily. The three hot stocks and small and medium-sized stocks generally rose. On Friday, the opening market was still in a rising trend. However, due to the bulls selling off for profit, retail investors felt panic and scrambled to sell, and the supply exceeded the demand. The market showed a sharp decline, and large, medium, and small stocks all turned back to small gains, but the fundamentals were still stable.</p>
<p>Internally, they are trying their best to eliminate cash panic and increase cash chips, and have executed the Ministry's order to punish 35 banks and money shops that are operating illegally, of which more than a dozen have suspended business. However, this change in financial institutions is not enough to affect the entire financial market.</p>
<h3>Prices</h3>
<p>As for the industrial and commercial sectors in a week, there were no significant changes. Major commodities and industries factories will soon get electricity supply and are preparing to resume some production. However, companies and shops in various industries have generally raised prices without authorization, citing increased raw material costs and increased living expenses, such as cotton textiles, silk textiles, soap, firecrackers, candles, firewood, charcoal, oil, sugar, etc. The rise is severe. Fortunately, the market prices of rice, grains, miscellaneous grains, flour, and wheat are still stable.</p>
<h3>Tram Fares to Increase Again Today</h3>
<p>Shanghai Urban Transportation Company submitted a request to the Ministry of Construction to readjust the urban public buses and trams managed by the company. The Ministry's approval has been received and will be implemented starting today (16th). The new fares for trams are as follows: Ordinary fare is 500 yuan, military ticket is 50 yuan. Monthly ticket is 70,000 yuan for adults and 35,000 yuan for children. Single-line monthly ticket is 30,000 yuan for adults and 15,000 yuan for children. At the same time, the tram fares managed by the French Concession in the city will also be increased in proportion to the adjusted new prices of the Urban Transportation Company.</p>
<h3>Service Hours May Be Extended</h3>
<p>According to the company, the company has made its best efforts to maintain the operation of the city's trams. Regarding the tram operating hours, it is prepared to find ways to extend them. The required power supply is being negotiated with the relevant authorities. Currently, the coal problem has improved, so there is a possibility of extending the tram operating hours. If implemented, the city's traffic can be more smooth.</p>

<h3>Charity Mini Soccer Game; China United vs Overseas Chinese United</h3>
<p>The charity soccer game organized by the Shanghai Football Association to raise funds for the Shanghai Mini Newspaper Association Welfare Fund will be held at the racetrack at 6:00 PM today. China United will play Overseas Chinese United. China United will have the strongman Li Yichen joining the team today, making the lineup even stronger.</p>
<p>Among our citizens, there is no shortage of those who love science, and their spirit of hard work is no less than that of scholars in other countries. It is a pity that they are not rewarded and are unable to concentrate on one field. If they are given financial assistance, they will continue to devote themselves to science and achieve success. If they can invent something or explain a theory, it will not only be their own honor, but also the honor of the country and society.</p>
<p>Last summer, this newspaper also held a science award, but due to the lack of enthusiastic assistance from the community, it soon faded away, which is a pity. In the future, if the city government hosts it, it will be more powerful. Moreover, the city government has now established a cultural committee to encourage wartime academic research, so the science assistance award can be handled by the committee. However, scientific research is slightly different from other academic research, so when evaluating the results, they cannot be treated equally. The main differences are selected below for reference:</p>
<p>Ordinary academic research can be judged on the report of the work results, but scientific research is not. The merits should be judged based on the purpose and method of the research. Why? Most of those who study science cannot achieve their goals, and can only select what they have gained in their life's work for later generations to continue, so even if the purpose is not achieved, their merits should not be ignored.</p>
<p>Since scientific research focuses on methods and steps, the competent authority should send personnel to supervise the work of the winners, and provide guidance and various conveniences at any time. At the same time, the winners must report the current status of their work to the competent authority with specific records on time.</p>
<p>Governments of various countries have always protected scientific and technical personnel. Therefore, in order to cultivate national power, the city government should maintain the minimum living standards of the winners so that they can work with peace of mind.</p>
<p>In this scientific era, we must not delay any longer. It is urgent to cultivate scientific cadres and talents to lay the foundation for the future of our new culture.</p>

<h3>Joint Program of This Office and Huaisheng Hospital: Report on Assisting Poor Women in Childbirth</h3>
<p>This office has a special arrangement with an obstetrics and gynecology hospital to provide free assistance with childbirth. In June, each parturient woman was required to stay in the hospital for seven days from the date of delivery, including delivery supplies and meals, for a fee of 10,000 yuan. At a time of such high prices, the amount of 10,000 yuan was far from sufficient, and the hospital still had to subsidize the costs, demonstrating commendable dedication. In June, a total of twenty-one women were admitted for childbirth, all with favorable outcomes. The total cost of 210,000 yuan was paid directly to the hospital by this office, and the women did not have to pay any expenses.

<h3>Responsibility Issues of Representatives of Penalized Banks and Firms</h3>
<p>— Hesheng</p>
<p>The recent severe punishment of thirty-five law-breaking banks and firms by the responsible financial authorities with an impartial attitude is indeed a social shock and a gratifying event. Subsequently, some banks and firms will undoubtedly learn from this and be more cautious, while others will likely revert to their old ways once the matter has passed. Therefore, in addition to requesting the authorities to continue to pay attention to the future activities of banks and firms, to seek a more thorough solution, I have the following thoughts on the penalties for the banks and firms this time:</p>
<p>According to regulations, the director is the external representative and internal supervisor of a company (banks and firms are also companies). They hold the highest authority in the company and are fully responsible for handling all internal and external affairs. The quality of the director directly affects the company. In light of this, the Financial Inspection Office stipulated in the "Strengthening Finance Order" that the chairman of the board shall not concurrently serve as manager to ensure full-time service and avoid negligence. However, according to the reports in various newspapers on the 12th of this month, as many as thirty-five banks and firms were punished for major illegal acts such as over-issuing notes, profiting from discounts, forging accounts, and hoarding for speculation. I wonder what the directors of these banks and firms were doing that led to these illegal acts? If citizens commit the above acts, they will be punished by law. Why were the banks and firms only subject to penalties such as revocation of licenses, suspension of business, and fines by the financial authorities, without any consideration for their representatives?</p>
<p>The illegal act of a legal person (company) is caused by the actions of the representative. Therefore, regardless of whether the act is committed by the representative personally or by subordinates (actions representing the company), the director, as the representative, is ultimately responsible. Therefore, I sincerely hope that the financial authorities will further investigate and transfer evidence of the above-mentioned over-issuing, forgery, hoarding, and speculation to the relevant authorities for thorough investigation and strict punishment of the chairmen and directors of the aforementioned banks and firms. At a minimum, they should be prohibited from serving as chairmen or directors of banks and firms in the future. This will ensure that they are aware of the consequences, act responsibly, and thus contribute to financial stability.</p>
<h3>Suggestion to Establish a Public Sales Office by the Trade Associations</h3>
<p>— Mu</p>
<p>In the past, there have been several instances of price controls, and the result of each price control has been a phenomenon of goods available at a certain price, but the goods cannot be found in the markets, which means the demand vastly exceeds the supply at the set price. Later, batches of goods gradually came out from the back doors of retailers, adding many vendors to the sidewalks, and their prices were freely determined, not subject to price controls.</p>
<p>For example, number 46 crude paper was originally priced at 132 yuan per knife (a unit of paper), but at that time, some merchants were asking for 200 yuan. Now, it cannot be bought for less than 1,500 or 1,600 yuan, and the original retailers have no goods to sell.</p>
<p>In recent days, the newspapers have published batches of new price controls. According to reports, these new price controls are proposed by various trade associations and then approved and announced by the Price Review Council. This is certainly a reasonable price, and the profits for wholesalers and retailers should be taken care of. In theory, it should be available everywhere. However, the reality tells us that, except for a few people with special connections, the general public still cannot buy items sold at the controlled price. Under the "Take it or leave it!" situation, people can only sigh at the goods or reluctantly buy them at a high price.</p>
<p>Although there are economic police patrolling, or you can report to the nearby police station, who wants to spend a lot of time and effort to buy a knife of crude paper or half a catty of meat, and at the same time attract a lot of unexpected trouble? Therefore, most people always hold the attitude of "Buy it if you can afford it, don't buy it if you can't," and are told, "Take it or leave it!"</p>
<p>Our meaning is that since there is a price control, the trade association should maintain its credit, and the government should maintain its prestige. It must ensure that everyone can buy the goods. Therefore, we suggest that the trade association should designate retailers as public sales offices in various parts of the city. All citizens can go there to buy controlled-price items. The goods in the public sales offices are supplied by the wholesalers of each trade association, and the quantity should be sold to the best possible extent during the validity period of the price control. In this way, the economic police will also have a fixed location to facilitate inspection, and the people will not suffer from not being able to buy the controlled-price items, and the price control can become a price control in name and in fact.</p>
<h3>My Views on Assessing Commodity Prices</h3>
<p>— Gan Dounan</p>
<p>It is stated that the Price Assessment Committee has stated that the assessment of publicly agreed-upon commodity prices has been too complicated in the past, resulting in the assessed prices being outdated. Therefore, in the future, trade associations will be responsible for drafting and submitting them to the committee for review and decision. However, for the necessity of emergency handling, the chairman of the committee may first approve and announce its implementation and then submit it to the meeting for ratification, without being as constrained as in the past by waiting for the approval of the Price Review Council, in order to avoid the disadvantages of delays and lost timeliness. However, this move still requires the review and approval of the committee, which takes a considerable amount of time. In a calm market, there is no need to worry, but in this era of rapid changes and fleeting moments, even a few days will inevitably lose the original meaning of the agreed price due to different environmental conditions; Moreover, after the trade association deliberates, it is submitted to the competent authority for record, which takes more than a few days for approval. Therefore, there is still a feeling of price but no goods for general daily necessities, and it is bound to search for them in the black market again. At the same time, the gap between the controlled price and the cost will inevitably affect the production process of general manufacturers, which will hinder the circulation of materials and promote the trend of unemployment. It is obvious that this is an obstacle to the authorities' policy of encouraging production.</p>
<p>In order to completely eliminate the above phenomenon, I believe that the agreed price of any commodity, unless it is obtained from the official allocation of raw materials, it is best to temporarily cancel the current price control, strengthen the organization of the trade association, and give the trade association greater powers and responsibilities. That is, whenever there is a need to change the price, the trade association is responsible for evaluating the price based on the facts, and it can be implemented immediately. However, in order to avoid the abuse of power by merchants and the malpractice of obtaining excessive profits, all directors and supervisors of the trade association should sign their names, submit the evaluation process and the cost table of the raw materials on which it is based to the competent authority for record. If it is discovered that the trade association has indeed falsely reported the market price and attempted to make excessive profits, the competent authority may severely punish it according to wartime law, then the persons in charge of the trade associations will not dare to take the risk and cause inconvenience, and will inevitably avoid illegal attempts as much as possible. If it can be implemented in this way, on the one hand, it can stabilize prices and reduce the arbitrary price increases of illegal merchants, and on the other hand, it can protect manufacturers and give them legitimate profits, in other words, it is to encourage production, so manufacturers will not hesitate to search for raw materials and be happy to produce, and consumers do not have to seek the black market. My humble opinion is as follows, I ask the people with foresight whether they agree?</p>
<h3>After School Evacuation, Students Should Adopt a Work-Study System</h3>
<p>— Renzhong</p>
<p>Recently, for the safety of citizens, the authorities decided to implement the evacuation of the population, starting with government agencies, and then evacuating schools and other organizations. However, the evacuation funds had to be collected by schools themselves, which was difficult to achieve!</p>
<p>Evacuating schools without simultaneously evacuating students is merely a nominal evacuation. If students are forced to evacuate together, the following difficulties will arise: Are the students' parents satisfied? Even if the students' parents are willing, can they afford the students' accommodation and living expenses elsewhere?</p>
<p>The first of the above-mentioned difficulties can be addressed by informing the authorities of the situation: "Shanghai has a large population, a shortage of food, and is vulnerable to air raids. Students studying in other places will be close to the simple customs of rural areas, which will benefit both their moral and physical well-being." Reasonable parents would not disagree.</p>
<p>The latter difficulty is not easy to solve without substantial financial and material support. After all, students' parents may not all have the ability to support their children studying in other places. When will the school evacuation be implemented?</p>
<p>Therefore, this serious problem of "school evacuation" can only be solved by planning ahead, selecting suitable locations in other places to prepare for work-study schools, and striving for "both schooling and no worry about food and clothing."</p>
<p>In this era of "increased production first," no citizen can afford to waste time. If some people are attached to the prejudices of enjoyment and live a drunken, dreamy life, then these young masters and misses are willing to be parasites of society and the country. (We cannot bear to mention the recent parties initiated by university students!) Looking at countries around the world, which students are not working hard to prepare to serve the country? After the school evacuation, adopting a "work-study system" to make up for the lack of consumption is the best way now.</p>
<p>As for work-study schools, the curriculum should be developed according to the nature of the school itself. Whether it is industry or agriculture, it should be adapted to local conditions and circumstances. However, it must meet the following conditions:</p>
<p>It does not hinder the students' physical and mental health.</p>
<p>It should be simple and able to produce in a short period of time.</p>
<p>For example, industry should ensure that students continue to produce after graduation and are still needed by society.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government should not only select professionals to handle industrial and educational matters, but also do its utmost to facilitate transportation for evacuation. It is also hoped that the administrative authorities in the area where the school is located will provide protection, and provide the necessary housing for the "continuation school" to the best of their ability, such as temples, which can be temporarily used as schools or workshops, and farms can be rented on their behalf, and offer preferential treatment such as tax exemption for the products of work-study schools.</p>
<p>As for the expenses, in addition to collecting part of the funds from the students' parents at the time of opening, it is hoped that the municipal authorities can solicit donations from wealthy people who love education and the country so that the evacuated schools can still have vigorous vitality, or even make the phenomenon of "graduation is unemployment" a thing of the past.</p>
