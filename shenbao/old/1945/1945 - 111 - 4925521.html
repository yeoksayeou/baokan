<h3>沖繩島南部砲聲不絕　日軍奮勇戰鬥中　士氣旺盛確保第一綫陣地</h3>
<p>東京二十日中央社電　冲繩本島南部方面之敵美軍，圖塡補該方面作戰之損害，而以火砲，軍需品極力推進輸送，並欲銳意準備攻擊，敵於十九日晨，再度以戰車數千輛及步兵約一萬之兵力開始攻擊，自晨夾彼我之砲聲不絕互擊，展開凄絕激戰，日軍依然確保第一綫陣地，同日夕刻，予敵重大損害，於陣前擊退。單擱坐陣內之敵戰車已達數十輛，人的損害亦極衆多。一方伊江島登陸之約一千敵軍，已遭日軍邀擊展開激戰中，截至現在為止，冲繩本島周圍登陸之敵兵力，已達約六個師團，日軍第一綫將兵士氣極旺，現正奮戰力鬥之中，此外於海上尤對湊川及其東北二公里之系數方面，十九日最來艦砲射擊更趨熾烈。</p>
<h3>日阿南陸相　頒發「決戰訓」</h3>
<p>東京二十日中央社電　日陸軍當局，以戰事已迫近日本本土一端之冲繩，爰特制定「決戰訓」，頃由阿南陸相頭發全軍，說明日軍將士前進之道，茲誌要旨如下：　日軍將兵應奉戴天皇陛下勅命，貫澈神州不滅之信念，盡忠實行，必勝之根基，即在於此。　日軍將兵應死守國土，蓋國土為天皇陛下所在地點及神靈鎭祭地，　必外攘侵製，本身雖死，猶留魂魄守護之。　日軍將兵應有充分準備，並以必勝必死之訓練，築不拔之城壘。　日軍將兵應貫澈拼撞精神，此為日本武人之傳統，以此將侵犯國土者悉數殺戳，使無一人生還。　日軍將兵，應為一億戰友之先驅，一億同胞均為持護日本戰友，於森嚴之軍紀下，發生戰友之情誼，顯現日軍之　姿，率先完成　國大任。</p>
<h3>特攻隊大舉出擊　重創沖繩敵艦船　戰局已入有利日方階段</h3>
<p>東京二十日中央社電　沖繩島一帶日·美航空決戰，自十六日以來，敵方益呈混亂狀態，戰局已進入有利於日方之最終階段，迭次日軍特攻隊猛烈攻擊，使冲繩東方洋上敵機動部隊及冲繩本島四周敵艦船集團受到慘重打擊，尤以敵空母損失更重，被擊沉十三艘，擊沉或擊毀二艘，擊毀六艘，共計二十一艘。其他戰艦，巡洋艦等被擊沉擊毀已達三百七十二艘，其中有數艘大致亦屬空母之類，如此計算則空母損失約近三十艘，地方大事宣傳出動艦船一千四百艘，但至今已半數損失，地方狼狽情形可想而知。自三月二十三日以來，精確認之戰果言，已擊沉四百艘，如每艘二千名計算，則敵人員喪失當初八十萬人，敵方今後或可再出動若干艦船，然人力之補充決不如此簡單，故於敵人言，最難應付者，厥爲大流血也。</p>
<p>陸軍航空基地二十日中央社電　沖繩島決戰轉機之際，日軍特攻隊賡續大舉出擊，予敵艦船痛烈出血與損害，然敵今仍執抝於該島周邊海域集結主力艦等二百艘以上之大艦船團，猶圖必死攻擊。自四月一日沖繩本島登陸以來，已二十餘日，此間敵之登陸部隊，據聞乃海軍第十一，第六師團及第二十四軍所屬之第七，第二十七，第七十七，第九十六共計六師團，總數約十萬左右，敵已佔領北中兩飛機塲，且業已開始使用，日軍陸上守備部隊對之連日果敢實施反攻，予敵極大損害。據大本營發表敵人員之損耗已通一萬左右，同時日特攻隊亦連日出擊，敵艦沉失於海底者巳達四百艘，為戰史所稀見者，然敵之野望，仍不放棄，猶强欲再作反覆猛攻，結局兩相爭鬥，餘者為勝，而敵之物量接濟雖勉強維持，其艦船究屬有限，然日軍之特攻精神，乃為無限制者，目下日特攻隊決非少數，航空部隊全體皆已成為特攻隊員，抱戰至一兵一卒之決心，期獲得最後勝利。</p>
<h3>新型流星彈　日神風隊所使用飛機　性能優秀破壞力強大</h3>
<p>中央社訊　據美聯社十七日昆明電傳，日本神風特攻隊用新型飛機之大量生產情形如下：日本現在滿洲工廠製造大批特殊之目殺飛機，並訓練自殺飛行士，以備將來作為秘密報復兵器，因此，將來在東亞方面出現之此項兵器，比德軍在歐洲便用之V1號及V2，號流星炸彈有更强大之破壞力。據可靠消息，日本現在滿洲大規模製造生產之特殊目殺飛機，能裝載一噸（即二千二百磅）炸彈，此種炸彈裝備於司機員坐位之前方，機首或機翼之尖端撞着堅固物件，立即爆發，此型飛機之性能極優秀，其在水平飛行時之速度爲每小時四百英里，於實行俯首急降下時，其速度能增至每時六百英里，駕駛員多係十八歲至二十五歲之靑年，彼等不携救命降落傘，　地出擊時，即捨棄車輪，以期不復歸還，因不考慮歸路問題，故其出擊距離頗長，此種飛機可開新型流行單云云。</p>
<h3>日銀二百圓券　將流通市面</h3>
<p>東京二十日中央社電　日本最近將有日本銀行二百圓券流通市面，該項新鈔較百圓券為大，正面淡橙黃色，右側印藤原　足公爵肖像，左側印談山神社拜殿，反面為紺藍色，左側印該神社十三重塔岡案。</p>
<h3>日地方協議會長　昇爲親任官　救命定今日工布施行</h3>
<p>東京二十日中央社電　日本政府因戰局日趨激烈，為强化防衛態勢，於增强軍需及食料生產見地觀察，計强化擴充地方行政，故以行政協議會長之地方長官為親任官，並將地方行政協議會之所在地，根據實况加以調整，會於十八日之樞密院會議時提出議決後，於二十日之定例閣議席上附議決定，關係此案之數令，將於二十一日之官報上公布，即日施行，關係此次之敕令有三條，其要點如下：</p>

<h3>所望於民衆大會者</h3>
<p>統一救國運動民衆大會，繼各省市戰時民衆代表大會之後，於今日在全國各省市同時分別舉行，在此時局嚴重達於極點之際，各地方民衆大會之舉行，尤含有重大意義。我們盱衡大局，有不能已於言者數端，謹貢獻於各省市民衆大會代表諸君。</p>
<p>民衆大會之舉行，要在集中民衆力量，以圖協贊政府旣定國策，而共濟時艱，挽回危局，以達統一救國之目的。故其唯一最高目標，在於適應當前時局要求而解決一切實際的問題。</p>
<p>我國當前最大問題，對外是如何實踐中日同盟條約，擔負參戰的義務。要解決這一個實際問題，決不是一篇信誓旦旦的宣言和花花綠綠的標語口號；決不是一紙空洞的決議案，最急要的是要商討怎樣實現全國物資戰力化的辦法，因為在目前只有物資的澈底戰力化，才能發生協力參戰的力量，才說得到擔負參戰的資任，也才能解決最大的對外問題。</p>
<p>國內問題，當前最嚴重的還是民生問題，也就是生產問題。由於以上海為中心的和平區各地生產普遍停滯乃至停頓，演變而為嚴重的物價問題，更演變而為廣大人民無以聊生的社會乃至政治問題。一切違反戰時國策的現象，如一部分政界的貪汚舞弊，民間的囤積投機，乃至社會上一切自私暴利的行為，莫不由此而愈演愈烈，日趨嚴重。所以，民衆大會一定要對於如何恢復生產，增加生產，交換具體的意見，討論切實可行而有效的辦法，俾在中日軍政民一致協力之下得於短期內實現。</p>
<p>目前或今後，如不能使物資迅速澈底戰力化，即不足以言擔負參戰資任；如不能迅速恢復生產及增加生產，即不足以言解決民生問題；不能擔負參戰的責任，不能解決民生問題，則我們一切民衆運動和政治運動也就失其根據，任何宜言與決議案都不能解決目前對內對外的實際問題。因此，我們所期望於各省市分別於今日舉行的民衆大會者，唯有上述兩者而已。</p>
<p>統一救國運動民衆大會，顧名思義，除解決當前國內外實際問題之外，似乎尙有更遠大之目標，以圖由和平區各省市民衆大會之活動，促成全國統一的救國運動；但我們須認淸今日我國國際關係及國內政治之複雜性，欲在這兩方面處於優越地位而形成全國統一救國之領導者，首先取決於有否切實解決內外實際問題的辦法？如果不能解決當前的實際問題，就是對外不能實踐參戰任務，對內不能促進生產解除民生困苦，也就是不能得到民心一致的信仰，那末，徒具形式的會議，是得不到實際成效的。這又是我們竭誠戲言於民衆大會和政府當局的。時危勢迫，深願朝野及時共勉！</p>

<h3>郝鵬舉省長談淮海省府施政方針淮海紀行之四</h3>
<p>— 逸飛</p>
<p>郝鵬舉省長繼稱：淮海之行政，目本人接管以來，其施政方針大約有下列數點。然而欲達成有的，不僅須視從政人員之努力，尤賴全省民衆的合作。現分別言之：</p>
<p>訓練民衆：此層已有相當之成績，以蕭縣論，民衆受訓者已在十六萬人以上，他縣亦在推進中，如是始能使下情上達，上情下宣，收得官民合作之效果。</p>
<p>復興農村經濟：欲使人民生活安定，實有努力推行合作事業之必耍，現淮海合作社資本六萬萬，對於振興農村經濟，頗著成效。</p>
<p>普及敎育：按淮海過去以環境關係，造成文化水準之低落，在淸代時，對淮海民衆向有侮辱性的評語，但時代的巨輪已將淮海轉到光明的方面上來了。年來省府對普及民衆敎育的工作，具最大的決心，進行不遺餘力，期使民衆對政治發生興趣，俾能發揮實現質正的民主精神。至敎育兒童工作，年來頗有成效，目前學齡兒童之入學，已較前增加百分之二十以上。又對教員之待遇，除其修束一律照公務員之等級同樣待遇。爲優待起見，並每人每月配給小麥七十斤至一百四十斤，使之能專心服務。惜因資力與建築材料之缺乏，年來雖學童日增，校舍無法增築，不得巳實行上下午輸流入學制，此亦僅臨時過渡辦法也。又淮海之最高學府為「淮海學院」，為訓練輕濟·行政專門人才之所在。至正在籌劃之雲龍學院，則為未來之淮海大學。</p>
<p>開闢交通與整飭民風：過去淮海之交通，頗為落後，因之民風亦甚陋塞，無容諱言。現省府一方面對交通建設作統盤之計劃，已在一一付諸實施，如徐州省會馬路之開拓，連雲港。南津浦。淮陰等處各主要幹綫，亦皆完成，以期對省防。民生。對外物資之交換等，能為有力之貢獻。至開導民風，省府除極力鼓勵保守固有之樸實耐勞各美點外，並實行禁烟禁賭。而官吏與軍人，則須按照余手定之「淮海省軍政人員革新生活　約」，嚴厲執行，如有故達者，決以軍法從事。前此者不談，最近蕭縣某特務長違反誓約，業已槍決，其上峯營副亦以御下無方同罪，扣押懲辦。今後仍將一本初旨，對官吏與軍官，須按才遴選，決不徇情。拔選後亦將使之認識時代，使負起保國衛民之責任。</p>
<p>對協方戰爭方面：本省先後建設醫院·營房·修械廠·被服廠·皮革等廠，大部皆在某地。餘則分散各處。至軍事敎育機關，有軍事幹部敎導團，滅共敎導團，經理人員。機砲·軍械等各部門之訓練班，務求造成技術優秀而決不擾民的機範軍人。</p>
<h3>哈爾賽選文　暴露美野心</h3>
<p>里斯本二十日中央社電　據十九日紐約來電，美太平洋第三艦隊司令官哈爾賽，在最近出版之考里成斯雜誌上著文稱，美國絕對不許日本提出正式媾和條約，媾和條約反使日本長時期處於「休戰狀態」，凡對一切戰爭罪犯之日本人，應處以嚴罰，不問其地位如何，不加任何顧慮，為報復日軍在太平洋上殺死之美國兵，吾人亦唯有對日軍處死刑之方法，決非余一人憎惡日本人，凡余部下將兵亦有同樣感覺，美國應使日本民族無力化，更必須使其長時期內無能為力，因此，必須有以下各項措置，　未經得反軸心國承認，日本不能使用一艘船舶。　對一切日本人剝奪其武器。　對日本剝奪一切作戰攻擊資材。</p>
<h3>日生產工場　不受空襲影響</h3>
<p>東京二十日中央社電　敵機於十五日至十六日施行夜襲時，以日本生產都市之川崎市為目標，投擲大量燒夷彈，若干中小型工廠發生火災，但經全體工員努力撲滅，使損失減少至最低限度，其中亦有數廠全部化成灰儘者，惟大部份主要工塲已先行疏散，故工員等於本廠燒失後，立即進其他工廠繼續從事增產工作，其燒失一部份之工廠，經整頓後亦已照常生產，工人精神更顯激昂。</p>

<h3>柏林攻防戰　現達最高峯　沃特河蘇軍建立橋頭堡</h3>
<p>東京二十日中央社電　據同盟社柏林特派員友枝十九日來電：德軍最高當局決意死守首都柏林，希特勒元首特於十六日對東綫全體將士發令誓死防衛國土，並謂「德軍應防止德婦女為紅軍兵士侮辱」，言詞殊為悲狀。德軍民發揮防衛國土精神，能否阻止紅軍攻勢，在此四五日之戰況中可以決定</p>
<p>瑞典京城二十日中央社電　海通社訊，莫斯科昨初次宣布蘇軍開始向柏林之大攻勢稱，蘇軍已在庫斯特林之西沃特河上建立橋頭堡，在沃特河及尼斯河之各橋頭堡，已發生大規模戰事。</p>
<p>柏林二十日中央社電　據前綫訊：環繞柏林之攻防戰，已達最高潮，蘇軍於近廿四小時內集中龐大器械，深入德軍陣地。德軍向柏林東方發出精銳部隊，全力抵抗柏林正面戰綫。南翼弗蘭克福沃特區附近之德軍，自沃特河東岸橋頭堡撇退，將該河之橋梁炸壤。</p>
<p>柏林二十日中央社電　海通社訊：過去二十四小時中，蘇軍增加對柏林之壓力，敵雖不惜犧牲猛攻不已，而卒未獲得戰略上之突破。庫斯特林。柏林公路之兩側，蘇軍略獲進展，勃柯之東及摩恩許堡（Muenchberg）東北四公里處，正展開激戰，蘇軍前鋒現距柏林仍有五六十公里。該地以北里森·史特勞斯堡公路一帶，蘇軍先鋒亦已越里森數公里，三日來蘇戰車被毀者不下一○七四輛。</p>
<p>尼斯河綫蘇軍西進</p>
<p>尼斯河前綫，科特布斯（Cottbus）與史普倫堡（Spremberg）之間，以及歌爾里茲與鮑特森（Bautzen）間，蘇軍均有突入，蘇軍似擬於特萊斯登區與美軍會師。斯洛伐克境內蘇軍在勃魯恩迤南之壓力亦有增加，巴登與聖波爾登（在維也納之西）間紅軍已發動大攻勢，故除斯丹丁區外，蘇軍均已採取總攻勢。</p>
<h3>希姆萊赴前綫　激勵將士　英軍迫近漢堡</h3>
<p>蘇黎世二十日中央社電　據路透前綫電：英第二軍於十八日夜向漢堡發動攻勢，第廿一集團軍司令蒙高茂萊現在第第十七兩機甲師國中，加入最優秀部隊之親衛機甲師團，而自南西東三方續行進攻，第七機甲師團突入距漢堡九公里南方之布許霍爾茲。又英軍先鋒隊於右翼數處抵達易北河，其左翼赴白萊門與漢堡間之汽車公路，自西方直迫漢堡港。又據該電稱，鑑於戰局緊急，德國內軍總司令希姆萊，十六日赴漢堡戰綫，再行鞏固防禦綫之組織，同時對該方面德軍致激勵之辭謂，「諸君請為元首獻出最後一滴血」。</p>
<p>柏林二十日中央社電　海通社訊：廿四小時內西綫北路戰事中心為魯納堡區（在漠堡東南），反軸心軍北進人烏爾森（Uelzen）及魯納堡，維頓柏格區無實要變動，馬格德堡之守軍在廢墟中力戰，進襲台莎城南之敵軍被擊退。德軍在哈勒反攻頗利，來比錫南部之守軍力戰不已。</p>
<h3>德方戰報宣布　魯爾戰事結束</h3>
<p>柏林二十日中央社電　德元首行營十九日發表：萊因河魯爾地帶間之戰鬥，業告結束，德軍數週以來於馬泰爾元帥指揮下，舉其所有兵力，牽制由兩軍合成之優勢美軍，使之不能前進，戰至最後，使敵兵及器械之損害甚夥。</p>
<h3>瑞士封鎖邊界　禁德難民入境</h3>
<p>蘇黎世十九日中央社電　瑞士政府鹽於德國難民紛紛逃入瑞境，業於十九日下令封閉東北部邊境。</p>
<h3>美陸軍傷亡　逾九十一萬</h3>

<p>里斯本十九日中央社電　據華盛頓電，美陸軍部十九日宣佈：「去年年底迄今為止，陸軍全兵力計八百〇五萬人。」</p>
<h3>德決盡最後努力　打破當前危機　郭培爾稱戰事結束期近</h3>
<p>柏林二十日中央社電　海通社訊：德宣傳部長郭培爾，於希特勒元首五十六歲誕辰之前夕，向德國民衆廣播演說，略稱，目前戰局雖嚴重，然國際猶太人斷難實現摧毀世界之目的，希特勒元首必能領導民衆，進入德國民族與文化最發達之時期，德國民衆遭遇空前危機，將以最後之努力轉危為安·德國於第一次世界大戰時，未能把握最後之決定，遂不免於第二次世界戰中，作加倍及三倍之努力。目前戰事行將結束。敵軍之瘋狂已越過最高峯，財閥政治與布爾雪維克主義之結合已開始崩潰。希特勒元首於去年七月二十日安然脫險，顯係上蒼保佑，使渠完成使命，歐洲必能建立秩序·和平·與繁榮，目前世人或有譭謗，終必深感遺憾，渠為防止世界崩潰之中心勢力，亦為德民衆最勇敢之領袖，德國必能獲致勝利。</p>
<h3>美企圖佔領　太平洋島嶼</h3>
<p>里斯本二十日中央社電　據華盛頓來電，美衆院十九日通過總額二百四十八億九千五百十萬美元以上之海軍預算案後，交付參院，當該預算案討論時，衆院議員殆全體要求美國於戰後佔據太平洋各島嶼。紐約州選出之共和黨員述稱：「硫黃島，塞班島，馬里亞納，加羅林等各島，係美軍流大量血汗所佔領，故美國應有權利把持以上各島」。蒙太那州選出之民主黨議員則稱：「為維護美國在太平洋上之安全，美國將日本委任統治各島編入美國版圖，亦無不可」。預料預算委員會或將因衆院　員之主張，正式提議佔領太平洋島嶼案。</p>
<h3>敵美艦船　損失重大</h3>
<p>東京二十日中央社電　敵有力機動部隊，於三月二十三日出現於南西諸島每域，開始對慶良間列鳥登陸，此次自敵侵冲繩以來，轉瞬已將一月，決戰猶未進抵最高峯，該方面今後將展開海陸空未曾有之一大消耗出血戰鬥。於此間敵之蒙受損失，單以確認之擊沉敵艦船已達四百艘，然而敵之企圖似未受挫折，繼續增援登陸部隊，强化接濟襤船，敵美同時以大量艦載機盲炸日方，圖實現奪取冲繩戰意甚旺，對今後之戰局推移，仍不許樂觀。敵對此作戰雖豪語動員一千四百餘艘之艦艇，誇言傾注龐大物資，然事實上艦因船沉毀，作戰受相當影響，尤以航空母艦，戰艦，巡洋艦，驅逐艦之大量喪失，予敵侵略上極大障礙，蓋海洋侵略作戰，戰鬥艦艇之使命，自極重要，不論開始上陸作戰時掩護登陸部隊之作戰，保護運輪船團時等，若無戰鬥艦艇，根本作戰不可能。</p>
<h3>美國的苦悶</h3>
<p>— 松平忠久</p>
<p>我離別美國已經八年多了，我所知道的美國種種知識已相當古舊，但我在留美期間，曾經和死去了的羅斯福握過手，出席過齋　大使主持的宴會，和華萊斯，摩根韜，易基斯，潘金斯女士等各閣僚談着話，並且時常到華盛頓國會旁聽他們的會議。又爲了不甚重要的交涉案件到國務院去，和遠東局長或日本課長等站在公的立塲上談過話，所以比較不曾到過美國的人，對於美國懷有相當興趣和注意。現在用我過去所得到的知識來談戰時下美國最苦悶的問題。</p>
<p>我自己也承認美國是民主主義的大木營，他們亦自稱自贊說尊重輿論，尊重人權，是一個平民的國家，事實的確如此。照美國歷史上看，他們從歐洲脫出宗敎壓迫和經濟不安移居到美洲大陸，因為不堪英本國的虐政，並且受了法關西革命的刺激，展開一幕獨立戰爭，排除一切君主統治機構，建造一個平民國家，所以他們的政治組織是互相牽制的，藉以防止專制，因而美國政治以三權分立為標榜</p>
<p>最高法院長地位崇高</p>
<p>當我到美國時，見到美國最高法院院長的地位非常高，僅次於大總統，而已較諸日本的大審院長地位超過千萬。那時最高法院長是休斯，他是有國務卿資格的，閱歷資望都很高。我曾經問過讀法科的學生說：「你們畢業後希望做些什麼？」有不少學生很有趣的回答說：「想做最高法院院畏。」的確，美國司法權嚴然獨立，始終保持一贯的法律尊嚴，為人民打算處處防止專制。但是我想這一點或許正是妨礙美國進行作戰的主要因素。最近芝加哥一家著名百貨公司發生勞資糾紛，他們因為不服從政府命令，致該公司的工塲被政府接收，店主於是向法院起訴，要求政府交還工塲，經法院判決，以政府措置失當，使政府吃了敗訴。這種訟訴事件，恐怕在美國很少見到的，但政府表示不服提起上訴，要求一再重審，該案至今猶未解決。在這裹也可以知道戰時必須有某種程度的獨裁政治機構，但司法機的跋扈，妨礙政府行動，此已成了美國現實的問題了。</p>
<p>國會監視總統行動</p>
<p>其次，握絕大權限的是立法權，此即所謂國會，國會是使政府——也就是大總統的權受到牽制，嚴密監視大總統行動，而國會中尤以參院權力更大，即使宣戰或媾和等重要問題，非經參院三分之二的贊成那是無效的，常威爾遜組織國際聯盟返國，但不曾得到三分之二的贊成，致不能加人聯盟。</p>
<p>再對於政府提出的戰時立法，國會亦有權利隨意加以修正，如最近的國民徵用法案，政府原規定十八歲以上的國民，但國會修正為十九歲以上。當時國會議員從選舉區農民那裏，接到許多反對信件，或在國會中公開披露，或刋於報章雜誌間，攻擊政府計劃，迫使政府計劃變更。此外，國會並且對大總統所施行重要政策，亦有權加以拒絕，重要人事亦必須經雜會諒解，所以政府對於國會是最難應付的，尤其如果總統是一位庸庸碌碌的之輩，那麽國會更加嚴密監視，一切戰時施策推行起來非常困難。</p>

<h3>財局擬調整房地捐　增裕市庫收入　羅兼局長出席記者例會談話</h3>
<p>本市宣傳處主持之第十三次記老例會，於昨日（二十）日上午十時，在市府會議室舉行，出席者有市財政局羅兼局長，主任秘書徐頌平，市宣傳處長劉德煊及各報社記者十餘人，對於各記者所握關於財局之確立預算，平衡收支，及消費，營業，執照等稅，曁出賦等問題，當由羅局長逐一解答基詳，茲分錄如次：</p>
<p>各項捐稅</p>
<p>（問）財局從事調整各項捐稅以來，成效如何？（答）本局對各項捐稅，除已將執照費費率酌予調整，物品零售消費特稅自四厘增爲五厘，各營業等稅估價予以提高，曁開辦舊一八兩區營業稅外，其餘各項捐稅，均照舊章征收，惟竭力注意納稅者之逃稅與代征者之侵佔稅款，暨不法經征人員之舞弊，三月以來，稅收增加甚鉅。</p>
<p>（問）各業逃被發現後，處罰者已有多起，截至本月中旬止，其總數共有若干？所有罰款是否全歸市庫抑取另定用途？（答）各商號因侵佔消費特稅被處罰金，自三十三年十一月十六日起，至三十四年四月十五日，共計爲三千一百〇一萬七千餘元，已繳一千一百七十萬元。至各娛樂塲所因違章逃捐，至本月中旬止共計四十九起，所處罰金爲一千六百八十五萬九千餘元，其中未繳者尙有三百餘萬元，是項罰金依照規定，均先繳入市庫，但得以一部份提獎告發人及在事出力人員。</p>
<p>（問）消費特稅最近征收情形如何？此次修正物品零售及旅館筵席消費特稅稅率之起因何在？（答）消費特稅征收情形每月均有進步，三月份連應解部之款在內，計收九萬萬五千餘萬元，此次修正稅率，因鑒於奢侈物品稅率過重，正當買賣反見減少，又筵席旅館採用累進稅率，不値稅率過高，且易使商號取巧逃稅，或從中侵佔，業經呈請中央予以改正。</p>
<p>（問）開征營業稅報繳期限至本月底為止，目前已收到稅教若干？開征此稅預算總額若干？現巳申報核計其總數已有若干？（答）前一八兩區春季營業稅開征迄今，各商號巾請報納尙屬踴躍，現巳征起三萬六千餘萬元，預計每季均可征九萬萬元。</p>
<p>（問）貴局所設置之鮮肉消費特稅收所，市區內辦理之成績如何？據聞該所對於郊區係每日按地認捐，其鮮豬隻數是否實銷實報？（答）豬肉消費特稅自歸同業公會第中代征後，一二月份共繳稅款八千九百萬餘元，市郊區均按豬隻數儘征儘解。</p>
<p>（問）新訓練稅務人才速成畢業，對於經騐能力如何？工作成績是否滿意？（答）新訓練之稅務調查人員，因訓練之期間過短，經騐與能力尙屬淺薄，惟經分派工作後，大多數均能努力，成績尙佳</p>
<p>（問）月來各飲食店戲院等，因舞弊代征特稅，被罰數萬，數十萬，百萬不等，在嚴懲奸商逃稅心理言之，固屬罪有應得，但觀其數字頗大，請問貴局意見如何？（答）本局對違軍及侵佔代征稅款各商號處罰之案件，均係依照定章辦理，所有處罰之倍數，係從輕並照最低之倍數計算，惟因商號侵佔之稅額甚鉅，依照消費特稅章程須照逃稅額十倍至二十倍處罰，因之罰款數額甚大，本局實無權減輕，但為體恤商情起見，酌情予以分期繳納，今後希望各商號均能遵章繳稅，免受處罰。</p>
<p>（問）貴局派員在北火車站開征單帮小販零售特稅，惟稽征人員態度欠佳，本先旣不加以解設，動輒得將鷄魚米麵等隨意拋鄉，此點應加糾正，如能在北站設一辦事處，則比較易於集中管理。（答）本局並無派員在北站開征單帮小販零售特稅之事，見從未考盧及此事，當予查究以明眞相。</p>
<p>（問）各縣財政局自本月起代征物品零售及筵席旅館消費特稅，其成效如何？（答）各縣消費特稅，最近始歸併縣財政局接辦，為時極短，尙未據報告來局。</p>
<p>（問）頃悉貴局發表財部修正關於筵席消費特稅率，將原來百分之十五至四十，改為百分之二十，並對供貧民膳食之飯　，亦課百分之十，一般平民日常食一客飯或在街頭飯攤零食，亦須負担如此重捐，似扔不勝其苦，請問常局可否援引以往舊例，對普通客飯悉予免捐，藉輕市民之負担？（答）本局經征消費特稅，悉遵部章辦理，在未奉令准免稅以前，殊屬無權變更定章。</p>
<p>（問）過去各新設之商號向貴局請領各項營業執照，其間申請與發照日期，有延遲至二三月者，於此期限內，貴局有不准甲請人預為營業之規定，因此各商號於此期限內而不能營業，所受損失頗大，未知貴局為體卹商艱，能有變通辦法否？（答）新設商號請領營業執照，應先備具保證金向本局申請，一面本局將申請籌副本送有關各局處查復，如認為合於規定，即行通知本局准予發照營業，否則仍須由申請人補正手續，本局決無故意留難，遲不發照情事。</p>
<p>田賦現況</p>
<p>（問）局長蒞任以來，所屬各縣之田賦及其他稅收成績如何？過央曾有浮收情事，現在是否巳弊絕風淸？（答）本市各縣區田賦現正籌備啓征實物，歷年舊欠田賦為數尙鉅，第經訂定淸理各縣舊欠田賦辦法，派員分赴各縣淸理嚴催繳納，過去確有浮收之事，現經查明嚴辦後，尙無同樣情事發現，希望各界協助本局隨時檢舉。</p>
<p>（問）各縣警米聞巳劃歸各縣直接征收，每縣若千？其征額是否一律？所征警米是否折現？其價格以何為標準？嚴否明白公佈以杜流弊？（答）各縣警米市府規定暫由各縣按警士名額及撥米數向各鄉區籌借，俟本年田賦實物開征後，再行統籌辦理，將所借之米歸還人民。</p>
<p>（問）三十三年度各縣區啓征之田賦，及寳物曁軍警米成績如何？（答）三十三年度各縣區啓征之出賦，係按實物折征現款，核定糙粳米價每石一千入百元，按等核征。（如任等上則田每畝征米一斗者折繳一百八十元，軍嚮米款隨同田賦每畝　征一百五十元，自十月間先後開征，除奉賢申江兩縣成續最後，征數達九成外，其餘各縣在五成至七成之問，惟南滙不足三成。</p>
<p>市庫收支</p>
<p>（問）局畏對於確立預算平衡收支之意見如何？今後對於增裕市庫，有無新計劃？（答）政府確立預算，所以謀財政府收支之合度，而示出納之有所準繩；但收支平衡，為確立預算之先決條件，本市目前支出方面，以軍警經費及公路建築經費均屬迫切不容延緩，其他如公務員之待遇調整，各機關因物價上漲辦公經費之增加，均屬無法核減。而牧入方面則因生產停滯，市民購買力減低，消費特稅與營業稅隨時有減少之可能，在　數預算時收支取尙能平術，預算亦勉能確立。但目前經濟情况動　不定，隨時有打破預算使收支不平衡之現象發生，財政當局不僅須應付一時之困難，尤須有遠大之目光，能適應未來之環境。本人對於今後增裕市庫之計劃，仍注重於開源方面，擬於房地捐方面酌予關整，現正積極計劃進行。</p>
<p>（問）市府及所屬各局處實行裁員加薪後，薪津支出較前增加若干？月又總數共需若干？（答）市府及各局處自實行裁員加薪後，每月薪津支出增加甚鉅，在未增如薪津前每月　給總額為一萬七千九百餘萬元，加薪後每月俸給總額為五萬九千九百餘萬尤，比較每月增加四萬一千九百餘萬元。</p>
<p>（此外並問）臨時救濟庫券各界認券情形如何？截至目前止已銷數額共有若干？（答）臨時救濟庫券，其中五萬萬元由復興銀行經收，尙未解庫，預計當可全部銷盡。</p>

<p>不動產典賣契稅，中央定有契稅條例，全國統一遵行，惟本市市區部份，前以環境關係，由地政局擬訂上海市微收不動產轉移契稅暫行規則單獨辦理，原屬一時權宜之計，茲悉市政府為統一行政起見，將上項不動產轉移契稅，暫行規則廢止，所有不動產典賣契稅事宜，由財政局依照部頒獎稅條例，統一辦理，業已令飭財地兩局，分別交接，即日實施。</p>
<p>免征絲廠業營業稅</p>
<p>本市市政府以絲廠業巳繳納蠶絲特捐，該特捐為中央稅，係根據絲價為完納標準，其性質已包括營業稅在內，故已令財政局依征收營業稅暫行章程第十八條：「凡廠或公司及其所設事務所，巳由中央征收統稅者，不得再向其征收營業稅」之規定，准於免征營業稅，惟絲綢業設肆營業屬於推銷販賣範圍，則仍應照繳營業稅。</p>

<h3>制止物價高漲　分三個步驟　陳實長召許局長商對策</h3>
<p>因黃金暗市之無理狂漲，其他有關金融之股票亦隨之抬高，擁有責產莫不活動於投機金融市塲。現以常局嚴峻取締投機操縱行為，市儈擁資者，有轉趨物資活動，故最近本市一般物價，漸有蠢動趨勞。際此本市疏散人口聲中，外鄉市民自動黝滬者甚為踴躍，人口旣見減少，物資消耗　較往前為低，物價勢必因銷路日少，而趨平跌。邇來物價欲漲之勢，當為一般投機囤積者操縱所致。實業部部長陳君　氏，對此物價高漲問題，極為注視，為防止此種不肖市儈囤積操縱計，日前特召市經濟局許局長討論對策，歷時甚久。陳部長指示制止物價高漲意旨，頗極周群。據探悉抑制物價對策內容，約分三個步驟：　執行限價，　嚴查囤積，　實施登記。常經分飭主管機關遵照辦理。據記者向有關經濟當局探悉，此次市經濟有關各當局，對防止物價再度高漲趨勢，早有密切連絡，及調查準備，如發覺有非法買賣超越限價或業外購囤物資情事，常以更嚴峻之手段懲處之。</p>

<h3>防空本部發表空襲時　市民應注意各點</h3>
<p>本月十五日淸晨四時十分，有敵機一架侵入本市上空，企圖轟炸上海北區，幸擲下之彈，隊落路中，僅使附近房屋一所及若干窗戶，略有損壞，詳情染經發表。本市市民防空本部，基於是日敵機來製時所得之經騐，特發表下列各點，以供將來防空工作之參攷，幷望市民注意及之。</p>
<p>空襲時應開啓窗戶</p>
<p>炸彈爆炸時所發生空氣震動，使落彈地點周圍約一百碼內之窗戶玻璃，均被震碎，由比可知空襲時應窗戶開啓，　其外另有遮蔽物，則應將此項遮蔽物拉開。</p>
<p>每晚寢時佈置傢具</p>
<p>構築適　當防空襲之重要，固屬不容忽視，但基於是日敵機來襲所得之經騐，吾人深覺居民於空製時，應盡社使用家庭內所有之任何堅重傢具，以資掩避，毯類及被　亦可用為遮蔽物，以避飛散之玻璃碎片，因敵　何時來襲，不能預知，本市居民於每晚就寢時，須利用住宅內所有適當傢具，妥為佈置，以資空襲時之防蔽，徜遇空襲而不及迅赴防空　內躱避時，則在街道轉角高樓大厦之傍及房屋人口　暫避，亦屬有效。</p>
<p>防空衣服放置床側</p>
<p>就寢時應將防空服裝　或其他適合於防空工作之衣服，放置床側，倘有炸彈在隣近之處墜落爆炸，使住宅窗戶玻璃被震碎，其時宅內居民切勿跣足在室中行走，觀於十五日空襲落彈之處，附近居民多有因暗中在室中赤足奔走，尋覓衣服而致足部被割傷者，即可知此種行動之危險。防空服裝，愈厚愈佳，此點亦無庸贅言。</p>
<p>玻璃杯瓶妥爲儲藏</p>
<p>當重量炸彈如是日最間所投擲者下墜時，除所發生暴風外，其隣近地點亦咸受若干震動，足使玻璃杯瓶等墮地破碎，為保護是項器皿以免受無謂損害起見，應將其儲藏於妥當之處。</p>
<p>空襲時避難之重要</p>
<p>查是日空襲時傷亡人數甚少，大抵由於時此淸晨，路上行人不多之故，於此可見空襲時避難之重要，市民須知在敵機侵襲本市時，爲自身之利益，亟宜逃避。</p>
<p>調查炸區居民安全</p>
<p>在該次空襲發生後，被炸制隣近區域，似有若干混亂狀況，故嗣後一經轟炸其第一重要步驟，為調查被炸區之居民是否安全，受傷或失踪，同時幷應注意有無火警發生，凡煤氣管電綫水管及總水管之受損者，亦應調查，以免有虛耗及發生火警。</p>
<p>備有數日充分飲食</p>
<p>各市民務須備有充分之水，至少足整二三日飲食及烹飪之用，幷在可能範圍內，儲備可供二三日用之應急食物，并在被炸區域內之市民，於轟炸後勢必忙於他種工作，將不暇往別處購取日用必需之物品也。　敵機空襲之時間與地點。吾人不能確定，故適時必須儲備大量之水，以備救火之用。至於每家均須隨時準備立可取用之防空器具，固無待言。</p>
<p>持以鎭靜切勿驚惶</p>
<p>空襲後市民切勿驚惶過度，但應持以鎭靜，並無謂之張惶失措，或將招致無謂之損害，苟能夠定如常，則可平安無事。</p>
<p>被炸照片輪流展覽</p>
<p>（又訊）市民防空本部爲使市民普知被炸情形，特於被炸區拍攝各種照片，流動至各區展覽，現在南京路江西路口上海電力公司欖窗內供人觀覽。</p>

<h3>日本國民義勇隊</h3>
<p>為强化本土防衛勢態起見，待望已久的「國民義勇隊」，</p>
<p>終於成立。茲就其目的、組織、運用等，與當局對談如下：</p>
<p>問國民義勇隊的使命、目的如何？</p>
<p>答此次決定的國民義勇隊組織，目的在預備本土化為戰塲時與軍隊協力防衛國土，即在確立所謂國民總武裝勢態，將防衛與生產密切連擊起來，以圖其飛躍的强化，同時準備完成在情勢緊急時大家一執戈而起的勢態。不過，國民義勇隊的組織，並不是於情勢緊急時立即手握武器從事鬥爭的組織，對於那種塲合的武裝隊組織及其出動，必須由平令依據法律的特別措置。國民義勇隊，換言之，就是進一步可改為武裝隊而突擊敵人的組織。各義勇隊員，均在猶如第一綫將土肉搏殺敵保衛國家的壯烈精神下，活撥從事其規定的任務。</p>
<p>萬一敵軍登陸，則補充運輸兵器彈藥糧　等幫助軍隊的任務，當然須組織武裝隊伍秋執行，那時就須有特別的措置。</p>
<p>各業人員分別編組勇</p>
<p>問　義勇隊的組織如何？</p>
<p>答　義勇隊的組織，原則上由市町村分區編成，此外如官署、公司、工廠、企業等擁有相當衆多人員的職業界，亦分別編組之。</p>
<p>以職業區域而編組時，須任意不要因此有損生產及其他業務的執行。至於依據市區村町等地域別編成的義勇隊，則以村落、町內會等為單位，最少須有人員十人至三十人。</p>
<p>再則，廚子則組成炊飯隊，木匠則組織工作隊，車夫則組成運輸隊，依照其性質編組諸如此類的隊伍，以資活用特殊技能</p>
<p>問　參加義勇隊的條件如何？</p>
<p>答　除出老幼、病弱、妊產婦等以外，凡國民學校初等科畢業以上六十五歲以下的男子，以及四十五歲以下的女子，皆須參加，唯四十四歲以下的婦女如果為家庭生活的主要分子，則原則上可以毋須參加。至於學校方面，則各別組織學生隊，他們如果出動組任前舉工作，即為國民義勇隊。</p>
<p>如此組成的國民義勇隊，於都、道、府、縣設本部，由地方畏官任本部長，統轄各該區域內的義勇隊；市區町村隊的隊長則由市區町村長任之；職業界所組的義勇隊，其隊長則由各該職業團體的主管人物任之。又，處於指導義勇蠍的地位者，則採取勸獎官民有識之士挺身協力的方針。</p>
<p>問運用方針如何？</p>
<p>出東協助各種任務　答　關於義勇隊的軍用，如出動協助軍隊時，則受各該陸海軍部隊長指揮；出動協助警防活動，則受各該官署長官指揮；出動於其他任務時，則準各該工事或作業施行者的要求而行動。而義勇隊的出動，則須陸海軍部隊長、官署長、工事或事業施行者向地方長官要求出動，由地方長官下令而行動。</p>
<p>組織運用之際，尤注意不與在鄉軍人會及警防團發生齟齪，以期兩全。這次的組織，在鄉軍人及警特團等一體參加，凡不作在鄉軍人咸警防團而活動時，均以義勇隊隊員的資格而活動。至於和翼贊壯年國、產業報國、商業報國等旣存團體的關係，則與從來一樣，縱以勤勞報國隊、女子挺身隊的資格而活動，也毫無妨礙。</p>
<p>問何時組成始佳？</p>
<p>答　義勇隊組織何時完了，是沒有期限的。地方集隊現取迅即實行的方針。國民義勇蠍並不實行過去在鄉軍人會等所行的曉天動員及其地形式上的訓練和儀式。（譯自三月二十五日讀賣報知）</p>
<h3>値得仿造的　東京防空住宅　「東京都壕舍」建築法</h3>
<p>日本首都防衛局，對於武裝下的東京市民居住問題，前曾設計資材勞力極省，而當於耐久耐炸性的地下式或半地下式簡易住宅，今已完成，稱之為「東京都壕舍」，公開發表。三月十九日臨時首都議會通過以五百三十四萬四千圓的預算，由首都當局在各區首先營造指導的基本型，預定每一鎭鄉會一所，全市共若干所，然後再指導一般市民建設之。</p>
<p>資材極省　　此「東京都　合」的特色，即在於可用有限的資材和勞力建築之。此外，因其形式是半地下式，所以能够忍受某稱程度的機槍掃射。以及炸彈破片，小型燒夷彈，實為焦土戰術下的良好臨時住宅，並且是避難的防空室，且可作為貯藏物資的格納所，具備種種良好條件。</p>
<p>東京鎭鄉會最初所造的標準規格，是凸版似的六疊（一疊約十八平方尺）一間，配以一坪（六方尺）左右的土間（屋內的泥地），仿此此例，亦可造成四疊半，三疊或入疊的。</p>
<p>至於所需資材，可利用强制疏散的建築物上拆下的舊材料，或進一步拆取現有住宅的一都分。至於勞力，現在維特鎭鄉會保甲的實行力，唯最近首都當局正與各勞務關係方面協議。</p>
<p>技術指導由首都防衛局緊急建築部擔任，揭出「東京都壕舍建設相談所」的招牌，而各區防衛課建築係亦負實與一般市民商洽。「東京都壕舍」的實際樣本，已在日比谷公園內公會堂前面建築竣工。又，所需費用，大致六疊式約女子一千日圓左右。</p>
<p>優點一斑　　據創此「東京都壕舍」的防售　村　庶務及大羽營繼兩課長談稱，其詳情如下；</p>
<p>問　其式樣如何？</p>
<p>答　如果可能，應採取全地下式，唯因地質問題以及採光，換氣等衛生上的問題，現在取的是半地下式。以在防空上很有效，衛生方面亦無問題。</p>
<p>問　下町等湧水地區如何才可？</p>
<p>答　在無水的範國內掘下去，所有泥土可堆在四周。</p>
<p>問　資材的運輸如何</p>
<p>答　此與建築地點有密切關係，可視建築物的疏散情形如何，在房屋已經拆卸的空地，以及凡不妨　消防活動，　難，防空壕建築等地點，都可建造　。至於次材的搬運問題，用馬車或貨車即可解決。</p>
<p>問　在房屋衆已燒燬的空地上亦準建築壕舍嗎？</p>
<p>答　一般的建築在復興的根本計畫尙未擬定以前，原則上暫時採取不許可的方針，但在調查地形，地物情況等以後，如果確宜建築壕舍，則打算指定適當們置，準許營造。</p>
<p>問　住在壕舍中時惑覺如何？</p>
<p>答　不但安全，而且也很舒適。通風採光等固然比不上地上住宅，但却冬暖夏凉。溫度也比一設建築物周圍的防空壕好點。（譯自三月二十一日讀賣報知）</p>
<h3>羅斯福之死　與渝美關係</h3>
<p>當此國際政局十分緊急之時，美國總統羅斯福突告逝世。對於羅斯福突然斃命的消息，世界上最驚愕喪胆的，恐怕耍算重慶人士了。因所謂美蔣合作，實際上並非信賴美國，而是成立於對羅斯福個人的期待上的。英國狡獪之極的對華態度，已無須我們再事指摘，而重慶當局者亦已體騐到了。至於美國的對華能度，則稍有不同，而為重慶向所憧憬着的。</p>
<p>渝方人士有許多動輒稱道美國的進步性與理想主義的行為，至今我們猶可在身邊聽到這種憧憬的口吻。可是，美國在本質上與英國實無絲毫兩樣。然而重慶人士為何有與對英不同的感覺而接近美國呢？關於這一點，富荷克林。羅斯福實有很大的關係。十二年來獨裁美國的羅斯福；使重慶陷於羅斯福即美國的錯覺中。羅斯福是策動大東亞戰爭的人，也是美帝國主義最賢明忠實的信徒，他的偽裝便是理想主義的氣息，由此而以近乎天才的巧妙手段接折重慶。</p>
<p>打一個譬喻，羅斯福的存在，正如包裏給重慶吞食的美國帝國主義這一粒丸藥的糖衣。糖是誰都喜歡吃的，而經過了十二年的悠久歲月，這層糖衣相當的厚。羅斯福個人，頗注意不直接拿出這味美國帝國主義的苦藥給重慶，而重慶對於這粒丸藥也相當戒備。聰明的重慶常局者，祇希望適當地嘗一嘗這粒危險的丸藥的糖衣，重慶早知道美蔣合作是有相當危險性的。</p>
<p>我們可以找出幾個具體的事例。例如去秋的召回斯蒂威爾，即其實例之一。這位帶有美洲印第安人狂暴性質的人物，自從奉命前往重慶以後，就强硬要求在他指揮下的渝軍立即出動於對日戰，為美國犧性。讓渡無異渝蔣生命的指揮樓，這到底不是蔣所能忍耐的。因此，斯蒂威爾與蔣氏之間的劇烈磨擦，終於難免。關於此事，當時外國記者早有報道。這個問題的獲得解決，就是羅斯福以「斯蒂威爾個人的性格」為理由而將他召回美國。</p>
<p>羅斯福雖然為了此事頗受國內輿論的非難，但重慶方面總算一時得救了，而美渝間的磨擦也有了潤滑劑。羅斯福存在的政治意味，由此亦可看出。</p>
<p>同樣的事情也可在這次哈萊大使返美的談話中　見。對于蔣氏以背水之陣而拒絕國共合作，美國的輿論與軍部卻堅決要淾國共兩軍的統一，長此以往，美渝當然會陷入正面對立的狀態中。緩和了這種艦長情勢的，依舊是羅斯福的巧妙偽裝。隨著太平洋戰局的進展，打算將此島彼島都永這置於星條旗下的美國議會的野心，所以未曾特別刺激重慶。其理由之一，即因重要對於理想主義者羅斯福的存在感到安心。</p>
<p>在美國議會所表示的對於大東亞的關切中，重慶或中國是不値得他們一顧的，他們有的祗是侵略主義和領土慾望而已。能引起新中國民族主義共嗚的東西，是一點也沒有的。其赤裸裸的眞面目，是隱藏在羅斯福這一理想主義的帷幕後面的。</p>
<p>現在，這層糖衣這塊帷幕均為永刼除去了。後繼的新總統特魯曼，決難期望他具有十二年來獨裁美國的羅斯福所有那副處理國際政局的老練手腕，以及壓制議會的魄力，至於理想主義的色彩，更加不要談起，由於後繼者的力量不足及理想主義的喪失，協約國方面將來的步伐當然受到決定性的影饗。同時，美國的對華能度也將如瘋人操縱下的戰車，不問三七二十一，橫衝直撞，盡所欲為。</p>
<p>重慶的對美關係遭遇難局時，每次都找不到解決者。重慶除出自為解鈴人以外，別無他道。在不久的將來，戰慶便會領敎美國的本來面目了。（譯自四月十五日大陸新報）</p>
<h3>如何安定民生</h3>
<p>— 周邦俊</p>
<p>自三十四年一月以來，上海工廠，因受電力限制，原料搜購困難，大都停工或減工，商店因社會購買力降低，有貨而無人問津。反之日用品之傮格，則突破上年紀錄，迥翔盤旋，實鮮下降之望，於是民生日益困難。</p>
<p>在此種狀熊下，社會失業羣衆增加，有業者亦不能樂業。良以工廠停止生產，工人工作無着，而日用開支，則一日未能或缺，徬徨歧途，莫知所從。商店因顧客之寥落，銷售所得，往往不敷支出，自身生存已屬不易維持，對於聯工家庭生活，鉅能再為顧及，於是民生難期安定，社會秩序難以確保</p>
<p>今者當局雖從事疏散，以為釜底抽薪，但因交速推進；是以對上述事實，亟應酬謀穩定之策，庶良好之安甯秩序，得應保持，愚見所及：</p>
<p>擴大小本貸金　銀錢業原負調濟社會金融之責任，過去放款對象，類皆工廠商號，在此百業凋敝之秋，為杜防游資趨於投機操縱之途，似宜側重小本貸金，使一部份失業之衆，得運用借得資金，謀取生存之機會。</p>
<p>提侶小手工藝　小手工愁原為我國固有之工業，自機製工業傳入後，小手工藝已漸被淘汰，但為適應現實環境，救濟失業，似應加意提倡，從事獎勵，其有不諳製作技巧者，則組設機關，負責訓導。</p>
<p>利用廢物製作　暴殄天物，在平時已所不許，當此物資來源匱乏，尤應儘量利用廢棄之材料，製作可用之物件，俾使失業者得從事於廢物之搜集，予以整理，因材利用。</p>
<p>如此，失業者縱無就業之處，仍有備得工作之機會，衣食國不能担保其無缺，目前之困難，則或因之得以解決。至於有業者之不能樂業，其原因不外生活指數過高，收入不能抵補所出，但能從事於嚴肅生活之委成，休閑時間之利用，未始不能解除共目前之困頓。爰申述之：</p>
<p>嚴肅生活之養成　糜爛之人生觀，為自趨身敗名裂之捷徑，當此時期，應力自檢束，就合理之收入，用於合理之支出。明知生活威脅，日甚一日，如能刻苦耐勞，未始不可應付萬一。倘或「今朝有酒今朝醉」，是自舉其光明之前程，當此時會，如能嚴肅私生活，自能身心舒泰。</p>
<p>休閉時間之利用　思想愈用而愈敏捷，工作愈勤而愈熟練；過去鴆於安樂，今後宜力加矯正，而况謀求本身生活之安定，更應利用休閑之時問，從事於生產之工作，兼職副業，不論其事之鉅細。凡足以增益收人，無一而不可為。如或習於蕩檢踰閑，雖日自趨沒落，要亦社會之　。</p>
<p>總之，節源開流，原為成家立業之　，處此環境。尤宜奉為圭果。若或不此之區，不特有業者不能樂業，而其結果且將陷於失業。</p>
<p>抑又言者，安定民生，旣非空言所能克奏膚功，又非單純救濟失業與樂萊兩點可以有效，問題甚多，姑舉三例；</p>
<p>疏通日用品之來源　日用品價格之直線上漲，足以搖撼民生之安定，食糧油鹽燃料，均屬一般日用必需之品，不能不設法疏通供應萊源，獎勵採辦運輸，庶價格得以敉平，人民負擔減輕。　　　消滅投機事業　投機類於賭博，旣足助長不勞而獲之惡習，復足刺激一般物價之上漲，抑且流言故播，人心皇惑，社會安甯秩序，因以不能保全，是以非作有效之對策，難期流底之消除。</p>
<p>消耗塲所之嚴格取締　社會人士，相率為投機之買賣，正當之工商事業，遂致無人扶植，且因其儻來非艱，漸尙奢侈，本不需要之小孩場所，遂乘運而生，不特消耗物資，抑且養成投籃茍安，巧取豪奪之惡習。</p>
<p>凡此種種，均屬促使民生不能安定之主要癥結。是以安定民生，應由多方努力，否則社會安甯之秩序，實不易確保，邦俊僅就目前現狀，略述暫謀解救之道；至於一勞永逸之計，尙有待於高明之商討。</p>
<h3>再談防空壕</h3>
<p>— 孟偉勇</p>
<p>現在本市的防空壕，固然巳走幾步就能發現一個，但是多數都為數衍了事的點綴品。我們隨時隨地可以發現下列幾點毛病：</p>
<p>開掘過淺，有的深度不到二尺。</p>
<p>竹棚的高度，多數超過洞的深度，故其受彈片的危險性較大；且竹棚樹立不堅，其外表僅用濕土塗平外，內部全係乾鬆碎土，隨時有襲裂倒坍之弊。</p>
<p>天雨積水，蚊蠅叢生，不合衛生。</p>
<p>防空工作應賽乎迅速，但是多數掘洞而未搭棚，不能應變。</p>
<p>構築不固；彈片未來即有被震坍之虞，非但不能保障聲明，反遭防空壕壓埋。</p>
<p>一般防空壕多築於行人道上，轟炸時極可能被其旁房屋壓坍，而致人民於死地。</p>
<p>防空壕無人管理。</p>
<p>因此，本人建議以下數點，貢獻給主管的機關參考：</p>
<p>縱觀上述諸點，其最大弊病，在乎沒有整個的方案和良好的指等，以致造成數衍塞責的事情，所以當局應設立一防空壕推進委員會，負責指導監督民衆如何開掘，令各保甲長呈報防空壞所在地及開掘情况，直接派員按址審查，能否合格，以免草率舞弊。</p>
<p>為避免震坍及易被彈片穿入起見，宜改用磚頭水泥建築（如南京路老介福門口），底部儘最掘</p>
<p>欲免附近房屋倒坍累及，應擇空曠之處開掘，最好請當局在空地或公園之處，如跑馬廳，外灘公園等，建築大規模堅固防空壕。</p>
<p>防空壕之淸潔與秩序，可請附近自警國擔任，門外應懸「能容人數」之不牌，以免臨時擁擴而生意外。</p>
<p>跑馬廳沿靜安寺路旁，有一水泥小溝（自新世界起至新昌路止），寬約五尺，深及四尺餘，日來一部份汗塞，奧氣四溢，天熱有害衛生，不妨將污水汲除，改築許多防空壕；非但堅固，且較一般防空壕為深，四周又無民房倒坍之處，頗合建築標準，當局倘能利用此溝，不但有益衛生，且有利防空，實為一舉二得之事。</p>
<h3>論學校提早結束</h3>
<p>— 江渝</p>
<p>據聞各校當局鑒於時局之緊迫，紛紛準備提早結東本學期課程；至於對今後辦法，則尙未聞有何其體規定。</p>
<p>竊以為倘僅以提早結束本學期學業來應付當前局勢，其法不為盡善，蓋如此勢必價靑年學子學業於不顧，亦必覆敎職員生活於不願也。</p>
<p>誠然，從學校本身言，今後繼續開辦，困難必多，如轟炸，如物價高漲造成之物質條件之困難，……此均為不容否認之事實。但縱有困難，而困難又非無法克服與補救者，上海為戰後學校策中地，則間有無數靑年學子，為社會國家培養人才計，實不容學校陷於停閉。</p>
<p>其次，目前各校敎職員之生活巳臨山窮水盡之地步，今後學校若再普遍停辦，斷其生路，其處境之為難，何堪設想！</p>
<p>僅就上述兩點來誓，筆者以為學校當局在處置木問題時，應兼顧下例三方面：（甲）如何使敎育事業適合於今後上海的特殊情况；（乙）如何使大多數靑年學生得以繼續求學；（丙）如何使敎授救師得以維特其生活。為要兼顧以上三點，謹述管見以供各校當局參考和採納：</p>
<p>春季學業提早結束後，應立即開學上課，採取一學年三學期制，或開辦暑期學校。此點已有數大學及中學創辦在先，若再將不必要之學科及學程質予停授，旣可縮短學生修學時間，又合於戰時環境及需要。</p>
<p>為避免今後敵機盲目濫炸，應立即設法另覓地址，在這情形下可採取：　分散上課，　偕用他校校址，　數校合併咸聯合上課等。</p>
<p>在安全地區開辦聯合大學和聯合中學，以疏散一部學校與學生；這點日前載敎靑周長巳在申報星期評論中有詳細的申論；唯迄至今日，尙未有任何具體辦法之實施，故深望當局能積極支特與援助之，而各校當局則應為學生學業着想，斷然效棄一切私人之觀慮與打算，互相聯合商討遷移辦法。</p>
<p>以上各點，僅就管見所得，略加論列，淺薄自所難免，而實行時亦定有許多困難，所望拋磚引王，能引起熱心敎育人士之討論，以期今後全滬學校歲置間題，能得妥善之解決。</p>
<h3>改良防空壕</h3>
<p>— 許毓杭</p>
<p>防空壕是為了保障人民的安全面設，但是本市的防空壕，大都距理想尙遠，舉例以言：</p>
<p>防空壕之無頂者，有下列各種情形：　　　天雨滿貯雨水，防空壕一變而為蓄水池；今者天氣漸熱，蚊蝟叢生，亦即為散佈病菌的大本營</p>
<p>日久垃圾堆積，不合衛生，南議陂路覺有死小孩置於防空壕內。</p>
<p>晚間吃路燈甚暗，市民行路稍一不慎，即跌入防空壕內，天晴尙好，下雨則變落湯難矣！</p>
<p>防空塆之有頂者——即在坑上再搭竹架而覆土者，則常為乞丐當作住宅，或有人以此為抽大烟之所</p>
<p>為防止以上情形，鄙人有下列意見提供當局研究：</p>
<p>防空隊無頂，最少不能防禦高射砲破片之跌入，故必須加建壕頂，以策安全。　　防空壕四周泥土應高出地面一二寸，俾免雨水流入。</p>
<p>防空壕由自警團負責看管，禁止兒童入內遊戲；如設見死小孩等情，應由値　團員負責。如有乞丐等入防空壕，値崗團員應驅逐之</p>
<p>防空壕晚間頂上應掛一紅燈，市民經過，不至跌入。</p>
<h3>凍結黃金</h3>
<p>— 毅</p>
<p>最近游資羣趨於黃金投機之途，烚赤行市，瞬息萬變，黃金固與民生並無直接關系，可是最近本市物價，已有刺激上升的現象。市政當局已表示澈查黃金投機，但是要根絕投機，唯有對本市的黃金，暫時凍結：</p>
<p>第一，銀錢業應即停止以黃金抵押效款；對巳抵押的黃金，呈報當局，予以凍結。</p>
<p>第二，暫時禁止金條飾金賣買，或以黃金為購買貨之手段，防止目前採取黃金形態之游資，再流向物資投機。犯者沒收其黃金。</p>
<p>第三，禁止黃金及金製品挑出上海。</p>
<p>如能採取上列辦法，不僅可以制止金價再漲，並可凍結游資，實為根絕投機之釜底抽薪的辦法。</p>

<h3>水</h3>
<p>— 侯千里</p>
<p>霹靈一聲，二房東太太宣佈：自來水度數滿了，這六七天裏不許用。</p>
<p>一幢房子裏立刻閙翻了天，有人還想提着鉛桶到自來水龍頭那裏見機行事，可是那位胖太太親自把守在那兒，一人當關，實在萬夫莫敵。</p>
<p>亭子間甯波嫂嫂第一個　啦　啦地叫起來，她舉出許多證據，設明她們家裏沒有多用水，她甚而至於洗脚水也是洗　用過的水。所以，用滿了度數，妙不負實任，池魚遭殃，實在也有點冤枉。</p>
<p>這自然引起一些人的不滿，於是後樓那個當敎師的李先生站了出來：</p>
<p>「孫師母，你不能這樣說，水是大家用的，這回，大家得負責點責任，譬如說，你孫師母難道一滴水就不用麼？難這從來沒有用過麼？你不能這　說。」</p>
<p>「用是用的。可是我們　省。」孫師母說：「我們通洗脚水……」</p>
<p>「這有什麼用？譬如說，一個學生考試不及格了，他再怎樣說以前是多少用功，也不會有用處的，是不是？現在，根本……」</p>
<p>李先生忽然想到這偶「譬如」與那位孫師母不大適當，也就不再說下去，改了口：</p>
<p>「現在要緊的是大家沒有水。要怎樣想法子弄到水。」</p>
<p>於是大家又吱吱喳喳地商量起來。二房東太太是不來參加的，一來她要管住那個自來水龍頭，不許有人走私。二來，老實說，她早已聚了兩缸水。這幾天裏，她不愁沒水用的。</p>
<p>有人提議到隔壁人家去借水，第一個人去的時候，還算順利，借到半鉛桶模樣的水回來煮了鈑，第二個去時，就被主人拒絕了，理由是：</p>
<p>「我們自己也差不多了。」</p>
<p>於是又有人到對面弄堂裏去想法子，因為那邊有一隻井，井水總是不受限制的，去的人是李師母，那位中學敎師的太太，　面弄堂裏人答應是答應的，可是井邊也有人看着，每人只許上鉛桶，還得排着隊，上個上個來。</p>
<p>不管它，這總比一滴水沒有乾受罪總强得多。</p>
<p>「這叫飲水思源，常知來處不易，」吃晚飯時，李先生向他的兒女說。他是到處「不忘敎育」的。</p>
<p>可不是麼？通一碗湯也是跑了一段路才能有的。」李太太身歷其說，當然知道得更仔細，活了三四十年，這種罪可還是頭一回受。」</p>
<p>指面的水當然是省掉，每個人在毛巾上抹一採完事，李先生發現這樣倒也好，非但節省水，也節省時間。沒有水畢竟也有好處的，他覺得。</p>
<p>可是一瓶開水是無論如何不能少的，自從聽到一位醫學博士演講後，四五年來，李先生始終沒問斷過每天晚飯後喝一大杯自開水的好習慣，（地原主張一天至少喝三大杯的），即使來處不易，但健康依然是要緊的，為了一　水虧損了身子，更犯不着。何况還沒到完全卉不着水的地步。</p>
<p>一喝開水，他才發覺水裏有一點異樣的味道，像爛泥，又像臭了的菜根，叫太太聞，也是如此，叫兒女們再聞，也一樣。</p>
<p>這可使李先生大大地奇怪起來，他到前後左右去一探問，所得到的結果全是一樣。有人問：</p>
<p>「季先生，你是敎書的，這到底是什麼原因呢？」</p>
<p>「井水的關係，」李先生終於弄明白了：「井開了了不用，就會這樣。</p>
<p>孩子們神經過敏地　起肚子痛來，於是世爹娘的人又忙着跑上跑下，打聽別人家的孩子們有沒有同樣的惑覺？問人家會不會是中了毒？以及吃什麼急效藥之類。並且慌張地，像出了一件什麼了不得的大事。</p>
<p>李先生究竟是敎書的，他有着「上海屋簷下」裏的那個小學敎員的那份神精，看他吧，這回兒他攔住正要跑出門去請醫生的一位太太。</p>
<p>「沒關係的，王太太，」地從容地抽一口劣等的烟：「我担保沒關係，包你等一會平安無事！你放心好了，不會怎樣的。決不會。」</p>
<p>「可是這孩子儘是嚷着肚子疼，差點兒要在地上打滾。「那位太太將信將疑。</p>
<p>「那是心理你用，我懂得。「李先生解釋着：「井水裏不大會有毒的。」</p>
<p>將那位太太勸回去以後，李先生回到自巴屋子裏。</p>
<p>「怎麼辦？今天水又沒有了，還是到那邊井裏去打麼？一太太迎着他。</p>
<p>「不要去了，到別的地方去想想法子看。」麼說沒有關係，可是味道也實不好聞。</p>
<p>「別的又有什麼地方有？」太太反問一句，接　　了一口氣；「唉！這年頭，連水也常作資員起來了。眞是笑話奇談，從來沒聽說過。這是從哪兒說起？</p>
<p>這可眞引起李先生的一大堆的惑慨。人們活在世界上，水該是要多少有多少的，這原是上帝給與任何一個人的禮物，不該有什麼限制的……</p>
<p>可是他這些理論能跋誰去說呢？　在眼前的是事實，他們沒有水用，沒有水吃，甚至連一滴水都得不到。</p>
<p>越是沒有水，需要水的事却越是來得多。譬如說，有位客人來找李先生，談了三個鐘點，一杯茶都沒倒，李先生只好老實地告訴那位同事他們家裏斷了水：</p>
<p>「對於水，」他說：「我們已成為若大旱之望雲霓了。」</p>
<p>於是兩個人都縱聲大笑起來，震動了樓板上的灰義。</p>
<p>這還是小事。今天燒飯可就沒有水，沒有水，生米是不能煮成熟飯的。對面弄堂裏的那個井常然沒人再想去。而且，老實說，即使有人不怕味道，仍然打算再去打一鉛桶，人家也不許打了。那個看弄堂的已經警告過：</p>
<p>「請你們議相點。我們遺井是每家五百塊攤過的，自己還沒有工滴，倒先請客！天下哪有那這麼好的人？」</p>
<p>李先生忽然想起他每天在路上看見有人在馬路上的紅色的自來水龍頭上等水的樣子，他覺得不妨去試試看。倒是用不着化什麼本錢，也不化什麼氣力的。</p>
<p>「呌阿官到馬路上的術平龍頭云弄點水。」他向太太說，像現新大陸似的：「快點去，不要給別人知道，人一多就麻煩。」</p>
<p>「馬路上的水能用麼？」太太似乎不敢造次：「給巡捕看見怎么辦？」</p>
<p>「好用的。我每天總看見一大堆　住那個龍頭，鉛桶，面盆，什么都有。人家能用，我們為什麼不能用？」李先生理直氣壯。</p>
<p>於是十二歲的阿官被差這出去，提了一隻鉛桶。</p>
<p>二房東太太的聲音在樓下饗了起來。</p>
<p>「誰不要臉？誰不要瞼？你有本事下來，你敢下來開開看！」</p>
<p>接着事子間裏也不甘示弱，那位甯波嫂嫂儘量提高了喉嚨：</p>
<p>「儂爛污貨！不要面孔，自家囤了兩缸水，倒不許人家用一滴！」</p>
<p>李先生跨了出夫。他覺得有調解太太們爭吵的責任。</p>
<p>「李先生，你是知書識禮的，倒評許理看！」房東太太好像有了後援，聲音更響：「自來水龍頭又不是我無綠無故關起來的，大家不肯省，度數用滿了有什麼辦法？倒說我不要臉，我不要臉在啥地方？甯波人就頂不講道理，我倒從來沒看見過……</p>
<p>「自家囤了兩缸……」甯波嫂嫂還是道個理由。</p>
<p>「好了，何必呢？」李先生拉長了臉笑着：「何必呢？大家嘸沒辦法，有什麼多講頭？水沒有用，大家一樣。……」</p>
<p>「所以呀！不嘵得到底是誰不要臉，嘩啦啦啦……」房東太太披起　　出兩顆金牙。</p>
<p>「算了。」李先生靜心地勸解：「房東太太，你就少講幾句吧，眞是，有什麼多講頭？不過，水到底哪一天才能有呢？沒有水用，眞呌不方便。」</p>
<p>「這年頭，不瞞你李先生說，做房東的人眞呌有苦說不出，別人看看…………」。</p>
<p>不管別人看　是怎麼樣，有一個隔壁的孩子像賽跑一樣地奔進來了。</p>
<p>「吳家姆媽，你們這兒有一個孩子在馬路上被人打……」</p>
<p>「在什么地方？」李先生全身一震。</p>
<p>「在太平龍頭旁邊，人家不準他等水，打得血也流出來……」</p>
<p>不等他說完，李先生已經推開門，大踏步地奔出去了。</p>
<h3>自由——覆劉臨</h3>
<p>— 翼凡</p>
<p>讀了你的「小簡」，我感到溫暖的慰籍，但也感到一點被誤解的不安。我極願接受友人的善意的批評，有時甚至是苛責——只要它是眞誠的；然而我也希望友人們能靜總一下我的自白，我的不是袒護自己的赤裸裸的自自。這樣，我們問可以有了更進一步的友情，和更深一層的了解。</p>
<p>處身在社會的被剝削階層，切身體會到種種難堪和不平，我時時苦悶着，抑憤着，間或也有點悲哀和孤獨感；但我並沒有想在記憶裏採取一點溫暖，為的是我的記憶裏並沒有溫暖可言。那在「重逢」裏所寫的重新咀嚼過去若有較甜發者，只不過是偶然興起的一點滄桑感吧了，——也許，這也是人們的情感的浪費。我說你求學比我强，你可以具有追求理想的熱情，這是可貫的。所以盼望你能抓牢學校生活；但却並不是叫你和社會隔絕了，天天懷着一腔的熱情在空虛裏「追求」理想，我的意思只是說你該趁未入社會還有着自由的身子的時候，用知職和體力去充實你的熱情。而因為你的境遇也不比我好到多少，你隨時也有失學的可能，於是便愈感到你現在讀書的不易，為你喊出聲來。但由此，你便以為我一入社會，竟失去了追求理想的熱情，其實不然。社會給我以冷酷‘以暴虐，我承認我被那些吸血鬼們撲滅了一些熱情，可是從這我也得到了寳貴的敎訓，便是：堅强的信念勝過空虛的熱情。而脆弱的情感有時更迷惑了我的生活方向。我開始懂得冷靜的需要了，我要用冷靜的態度去辨認，去抵抗，去進攻，……。然而，朋友！我不得不在這裏覺到我的話太「熱情」點了，事實上，假如我不」隻身跳出生活的縛束，還我一個自由的生命，」我便很難有進攻的可能。這兒的「生活」，你不懂，但你應該懂。當然是指那無可　脫的家處的飯担子了。為了一家人的最低的生活，我便只好忍氣吞聲，去把大量的精力換得菲薄的報酬，我便不能以正義公理去挺撞剝削我的人。這些話，只有和我同一處境的人才能體感到那確實性，那沉重性。至於有些友人，咸者會實我沒有勇氣，趨於消極，但我何嘗沒有憤懣？只是若一「任性」，我便將看見親人底飢餓的苦臉！試想想看，假使我永遠不隻身跳出，我怎能去幹我想幹的工作？去達到我的希望？（而人又不願做自　自的好夢。）所以我便說下了後面的那幾句。你能明白我的苦衷嗎？謝謝你的鼓勵，是的，我正面對着生活的苦難，我更將以頑抗這苦難為安慰。那些虛渺的安慰我早已撇棄了，不，也可以說我不曾想要過什麼虛渺的安慰。但正因為我要面對着這廣大世界上多方面的苦難，集合了伙伴的力量去搏鬥，我才想到要隻身跳出生活的縛東。否則。眞如你所說，我只看見自巴的生活和家庭，我為什麼不可以像那些「向上爬」的人一樣，去專心於攢營吹拍？這樣，不久，我不是可以使我自已和家庭的生活當裕一點嗎？但朋友，這可是我所願意的麼？</p>
<p>你說「重逢」裏的C君和我融和起來，正好是我自巴的寫照，刻劇了我思想的矛盾。道不得不令我詫異於你的還未了解我。其實，我怎會憎厭都市，愛懸鄉村？都市和鄉村都是人類所組成的社會，在目前都多有着黑暗面，少有着光明面。我僧厭的是那不良的制度，那吃人的同類，他們旣在都市，也在鄉村；同時我愛戀着美麗的幻夢，當然，我的理想也絕不是所謂局部的「建設鄉村」了。</p>
<p>有些話，也許正是部份被剝削者所想說的；而假如還値得你以外的人們去看者的話，那末這發表也就不無意義了。</p>
<h3>拾遺記</h3>
<p>— 陳實</p>
<p>老劉拿着一捲鈔票，嘆千塊錢眞苦了我！」</p>
<p>我詫異道：「祇有人苦鈔票，那有鈔票苦人的事？</p>
<p>「你不明白這原由，且聽我說來。」他正襟危坐，說遭：</p>
<p>「正月初二那天，我和老許在一個同事家吃飯，客人很多，好發桌馬將打得要熱鬧。飯後，有幾個客人散了，主人激請我和老許凑搭子，重又組織起一桌馬將。不到兩圈，老許就輸了好幾千。</p>
<p>世界上所有不幸的事中，這該是一件——自然更不幸的事還在後面——你知道，老許這人眞說得上克勤克儉。我跟他打伙了逋些年頭，從不見他多化一個銅子。</p>
<p>「老劉！你說吧，有比錢更寳貴的東西麼？」他常遭末說：年紀靑的時侯，火氣重。鎭天價談什麼末名譽，道德，學問和修養。一說到錢，臉就紅起來。可是，社會上混久了。什末學問，道德都沒有這一回事，人崇拜的就祇有錢！」</p>
<p>老許節儉，可是好賭　。到同事家去，他德忙着抬桌子，舖桌在。緊手省下來的錢，鬆開手在桌子上磨呀磨的，就都溜了去·我們常笑他：「鴨子不撒尿，可有一路去。」</p>
<p>請想想吧，輸了這許多錢，他多難受！一付牌沒塌倒，他總得數好幾次錢。</p>
<p>「四千五百零十塊！」他抓抓頭皮，咕嚕道：「不！四千五百五十。」</p>
<p>「喂！伍萬要不要」上家不耐煩地用肘提醒他：「待一會兒，別又說我特為不告訴你。」</p>
<p>打完了脾，我們坐在沙發上談天。</p>
<p>「我一共輸了六千，」老許漲紅着臉，顯得很激動。他不能安心談話。</p>
<p>這時侯，一位同事忽然呌道：「這兩千塊錢是誰的？」他從桌子的抽屜裏不經地心找出兩千塊錢來。</p>
<p>那位同事一喊，老許就跳了起來。</p>
<p>「這兩千塊錢是我的！」你說。</p>
<p>並沒有什末料葛，這兩千塊錢就從那位同事的手裏，到了老許的口袋裏</p>
<p>「對的，一點不錯——」老許沉思了半繃，對衆人宣佈道；</p>
<p>「剛才我忘了數袋麥的錢。我一共帶來二萬，一萬放在桌子上，一萬歲在袋喪。後來只收進兩千。我祗富袋裏已有一萬四了。現在我數了數，假使這兩千塊不找芯，祇剩了一萬二千。」</p>
<p>他袋裏帶來多少錢，我們不知遺。我們不能否聽這話的眞實性。</p>
<p>不久。大家就淡忘了這件小事。談話仍舊繼續着，老許可心不在焉，偶然附和一兩句，或者勉强笑幾聲。</p>
<p>有一天，老許來看我，談着談着地，「老劉，你記得嗎？」突然他打斷了話緒，走到桌子邊說道：「起先我坐在這個位十裏（他指的量找出鈔粟來的那個座位的對面），你坐在對面。「板門」以後，我跟你換了一換。後來我又坐到左面道個位子上，遺落這兩千塊錢在這裏。你坐在這兒的時侯，有沒有拉開抽屜來看過？」</p>
<p>「我沒有，」我說：「遺鈔票是你的，不會錯的！」</p>
<p>但我不能够證明，老許似乎不灘意，默默坐下來。</p>
<p>隔了一天大淸早，老許突然在我的臥室裏出現。我們隨便談了些，他又提起那兩千塊錢。</p>
<p>「那兩千塊錢算的是我遺洛的！」他訥訥而言。於是他又重說了一遍：他忘了放在桌子上的是二萬二千；他從這裏搬到對面，又從那裏移向左面…………等等。</p>
<p>「你算多心，誰說這錢不是你的！」我說：「你不會把這末幾千塊錢效在心在。」</p>
<p>「你這話是甚末意思？」驀的，他冷瞼責問。」「你這話是甚末意思</p>
<p>他站起來，戰抖着說：「你簡直混蛋…你輕視我的人格。」羞惡使他不自然。</p>
<p>「你嘴裏說：」遺錢是你的。」可是你心裏全不是那回事。」他說：「你心裏在說：「你看他，這傢伙倒底做賊心虛。」你輕視我的人格。」</p>
<p>「你要我怎末說是好？」</p>
<p>「問你自已！你心裏在笑：「這錢明明是那個女人的」你特為瞞我不說，你當我還不知道。你存心看我在你眼前無恥地再說一遍賴別人的錢，你存心玩弄我！這還算是朋友？你的心眼多刻毒！」</p>
<p>「我沒有辦法披瀝心肝給你瞧，」我說：「但；，我打心底就不知道那回事。你無緣無故扯上一個女人……。</p>
<p>「你難道不知道？」他說：「第二天，一個女客人忽然宜佈這兩千塊錢是她的。她說她打完馬將，忽忽四家，忘了抽屜裏的錢。第二天早晨，她才發覺。這就是說，這錢在我們沒打牌以前就在那抽屜裏，我並沒有遺落過。這不明明是笑話？丟了兩千塊錢，會在第二天發覺。可是，人家竟相信她的話。他們輕視我的人格，以為我沒有錢，又輸了這</p>
<p>「我沒有聽見他們這末說過！</p>
<p>「現在請你把這兩千塊錢交給主人，」他說：「我老許不希罕。你對地說這錢明明是老許的，現在就算捨施給那個下賤婊子吧！」他沒有再說，就起子去了。</p>
<p>我把這錢帶到那位同事家裏，可是主人拒絕接受。他認為這是一件極不幸的事。老許當然不會冒認，那女客人也不至於扯謊。這準是誤會了，也許是巧合。他巳經弒下墊兩千塊錢，給那個女客人。並且叫我把這兩千塊還給老許，說是那女客人弄錯了，她並沒有落下。</p>
<p>老劉嘆了一口氣，結束了這個故事：「但是，老許可不肯再收下。你說，遭叫我怎末辦？」</p>

<h3>人生</h3>
<p>— 俞若文</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>丁諦先生在他的「人生悲喜劇」的自序中，有一段說：「…我覺悟我所處的道一個社會，是商業重心的社會，畸形的商業重心的社會！商人周然是商人，無一而不是商人，在現今的世界上，沒有文化，沒有宗教，沒有道德，沒有敎育，也沒有値得人留戀，値得人憧憬的精神生活，一切只是商業：商業化的世界，商業化的人類！」</p>
<p>是的！丁締先生的話是透澈而又透澈的。</p>
<p>一切都是商業！商業化的生活，商業化的談吐，商業化的人情，甚至於骨肉之間慈愛的維持也需要借重商業不可。</p>
<p>處在這樣一個世界上的靑年，沒有一個不對它恨！恨！</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>人生是一塲戲麼？是的，人生確實是一塲戲！</p>
<p>我慣於把全全部的人生放在眼底，像一隻大鵬為俯瞰下面的世界，我祗覺得人類的　，蠢！</p>

<h3>下週可望舉行白馬盃盛大足球賽</h3>
<p>以國際盃決賽之盡成番隊，故足球賽已鮮吸引之能力，詎意在此沉寂聲中據悉三有體育會正在籌備邀足球賽之外，福華烟公司決舉辦「白馬盃」是球賽一塲，已量足聯會核准，決定於下星期內舉行，（大致為星期日）所邀隊伍，為白馬對僑聯。</p>
<p>安　華烟公司總經理程伯庵提倡足球，不遺飲力，去夏曾辦福華盃小型　　聯賽，　極一時。此次復不惜物力心力，舉辦盛大足球賽一塲，各方而之接洽，然費一番精神，現亦全部就緒，祇待足聯會排定日期，一塲最精彩之足球賽，即可獻於球迷之前。</p>
<p>白馬組織東華聯誼各借將士</p>
<p>查白馬隊足聯會登記曾員，當不能允准比賽，但其球員，則為東華聯誼兩會員隊之隊員，故山白馬當局出面向該二隊借將之公函，再由該兩隊當局允准借與蠍員之信件，併呈足聯會，乃得足聯會之允許焉。其隊員為東華甲組全體將士，聯該所借者，則為朱靈聖，李義臣，羅壽福三人，其實力之動强，一觀名單，可以想像及之。</p>
<p>貢獻白馬兩個陣容白馬旣搜集名將而成，當有一擒僑聯之可能。姑無論勝負誰屬，演出之特佳，可以預卜。値此大戰之前，維者有二個陣容實獻，以供當局參考，擇一而用，自可望成功。其一：張邦綸張李林義根臣梁　棠　福　宋靈聖李　孫　順戴　經韓　海賈幼良</p>
<p>後衛之用張李二人，軍其大刀闊斧，足以威脅僑聯之竄入，理似充足。但所懼者，張李二將任內衛時俱有過勇而在禁區內造成犯規人之可能。如二子特別留意此點，一對鐵閘，殆可一新球迷眼福。中衛綫上，旣以林根之後移，常非朱靈聖莫屬，如此調度，不可謂不常。前鋒錢上，有韓龍海趕返助陣，自當用此原班人馬，猶憶東華最折與僑聯數戰，進攻機會，惜以少一如龍海能竄之內鋒，而遭敗挫，觀衆莫不憶念此自袍小將。迺者，韓將軍一到，賈幼良再回原位，五錄間之聯絡功夫神妙傳遞，默契合作，果為一般球迷所熟稔，眞不必筆者曉曉也。其另一陣容，可為：張邦綸李義臣莊友仁朱靈聖經福楨張林根李垚孫錦順買幼良</p>
<p>此陣容之第一理由，即莊友仁之近况彌佳，力亦充沛，自應重用，且與林根能前呼後應，彼此照顯，不露破綻。第二理由，則為如照第一陣容，左前衛梁樹棠與左後衛李義臣咸以隸屬兩隊，不免生疏。况僑聯前鋒生狠者右鋒及右翼，故以朱靈聖替梁樹棠，旣以朱李同為聯誼，必多知彼知己之球路，而朱之活躍及氣力，亦較梁為勝。以此而守住對方之右路，削減其攻勢，應為合理之上策也，致前鋒綫，則已如上述無改動之必要也。</p>
<p>綜觀上列二個陣容，可稱華隊中最標準之人選矣。即較之本屆國際盃之中華隊，有過之無不及。福華當局，有此毅力，使行將逝去之足球季有此一幕最引人入勝之盛大比賽，鬨動球　，實値得稱頌</p>
<p>各項儀式已經擬定　該起為隆重起見，儀式亦經考慮，決敦精吳蘊齊舉行開球典禮，給獎則巳聘定劉瓊。其餘如獎品之高貴，及用作皮最球上之物優，俱為數年膠之最上物品，可稱為最近球賽中罕見者。</p>
<p>白馬全隊昨總練習　白馬全體隊員為應付此大戰起見東見華，特於昨全時在東華球塲作總練習，全體情神奕奕，懶牛李義臣作亦蒂盃云複賽前以實代表中華隊國際盃複表，置係甫由崇明來滬，球鞋久隔自無管束能力，致使球迷失望。此番旣承白馬再邀，且經數度練習，自可有較滿之成績，筆者觀其脚頭之爽脆，確屬高人一等，此次確任後術者，我意維拉必無生路，而望風披靡。又龍海昨亦駕到，風麼僕僕，蒼黑多多，但觀其速度之高，雄風毫無減色，行將使僑聯守門麥尼蒂見而生怯。其猛竄之镜頭，不致要顯倒幾許球迷。（必賢）</p>
<h3>足球五強概論</h3>
<p>— 思思</p>
<p>本屆足球聯賽已成尾聲，大勢已定，唯有葡商與聯誼之重賽較有出入，觀乎本季一季之作戰經過，際此結束之時，不妨對五强隊外一槪論，無分前後，信筆所至。</p>
<p>東華</p>
<p>上屆之威風，不可一世。球壇震驚，一致推頌，本屆開始之初，我人甚審與無限之股望，且亦必信其能再接再厲，孰意該隊因種種關係，鮮於練習，乃致逢葡商時，大敗而退，因此士氣一銳，再造成敗於球文都之冷門，直至最折一役，與僑聯之戰，奮其餘勇，以圖收復令譽，結果仍屬失利。但其土氣，則確較季初為旺盛也。綜觀該隊之各方而，決不因一季之相隔，而有多大之退化，所以失敗者，全在氣耳。李甯梁樹棠戴麟經孫　噸上屆頻多練習而有返老還童之象。反之，本屆因缺少練習，而父有力不從心之老態，此實為木屆之唯一缺憾矣，唯余對該隊之精神方面，認為愜意，其能吸引大量觀衆，即為明燈。</p>
<p>聯誼</p>
<p>加入本屆聯賽之初，有羅壽加等賽小之將初之，通袂加入，素以鋒將零落之聯誼，有此人選，便亦見楚楚可觀。果也，出師之初，整勢赫赫，大有本年天下，唯我　尊之慨。不料在中途旣和德高，再與滬警造成平手。因之一鼓勇氣，受一挫折。與葡商之爭奪戰，鬧成不歡結局。現雖得重賽機會，無如瞿水福吳祺祥之被刪，損失綦大，調度果仍有方，相形之下，難免較遜。以故重賽之日，似乎不敢望有多大收獲，恐亦成聊蓋人意士意之。但如余聯誼將士之球藝，如能有其本季集中訓集時之精神不屈不撓，前途實光明此燦爛，我人經望該隊能如此耳</p>
<p>葡商</p>
<p>該隊將有榮任本屆聯賽之冠軍絕對希望矣。其所以能獲此佳果者，首在得福恩W潘脫遜柯萊脫之助陣，鮑休脫之出山，以故士氣大增。緣葡商歷屈對聯賽並不重視，本屈突有此一變者，亦令人莫知其所以然矣。該隊本屆確有幾塲有成功之演出，鮑休脫之誘盤功夫，福恩之速度，奧列維拉之威風八面，均為球迷賞議稱道。此後該隊尙有對聯誼之甫賽一役，大致可望迎刃而解，完成戰果。</p>
<p>僑聯</p>
<p>以僑聯首本席之雄，而未能獲得首席者，不免有幾分惋惜耳。最顯著者，與德商之戰，以誤會未出席，乃遭棄權之判，損失一塲，否則以僅敗於聯誼一塲之戰績而言，大有登皇座之可能，至少亦得與葡商分庭抗禮。但同下該隊對市長盃已獲冠軍，由該隊淸一色代表之義大利隊，亦得國際盃決賽權，雖則失一聯賽冠軍，如能運得該兩項錦標，當可告慰，不負其一番心血矣。觀其近况之佳，國際盃壓倒北歐，極有把握，設若聯賽中不失去者，則包辦三項冠軍，磊有代東華上屆雄風。</p>
<p>滬警</p>
<p>滬警之人選而言，決應列於强隊之一，無如其在聯賽之初，成續大失所望　細考其原因，則為無新穎之戰術絕無蓋默以以與後起之間，絕們默契，以此徒有一二新將個人技術之進步領而會已自。多唯戰事，，入故後在幾市經長盃中突能一舉而奪得決實權，雖聊以自慰？但亦足聊以自慰？據悉該隊因多數隊員，在市長盃決賽後離滬，足球隊亦　之瓦解，不免使人有敘散之感，「滬警」兩字殆亦成足球歷史上之一隊矣</p>
<h3>籃球慈善賽最後一幕華聯受挫癥結</h3>
<p>華聯藥廠主持之籃球慈善賽，其第一第二兩戰之評述，上期已述之，其最後一幕，則於上週六在入仙橋靑年會健身房比賽，為華聯迎戰巨人隊，我人寄與華聯無限之股望，但劇「戰結果，華聯仍遭敗挫者，記者細察是戰戰程，其失敗之理由，應為：</p>
<p>震中缺席</p>
<p>華聯為增厚實力，特向汕隊及中北借將，唯第二戰時，霍中未到，故筆者曾於上期作希望震中出席之誠懇語。蓋震中確有指揮及運繁全隊之本領，不悉何故，此最後一戰時，震中仍未見駕到，此在其餘隊員之士氣方面，不無影饗。而因隊員之來自幾隊關係，確少一如震中之中心人物。</p>
<p>調人不當</p>
<p>華聯應用陳學崇，張一良雄，徐菊生，卓國榮上馬燦希五人作戰，極為可取，中途之突以包松圓張錦璇調入，實為不當。蓋其時作戰各個之情形均在正常中，何以隨便調人，况隊人非屬同隊者，多加調換，決非上策。</p>
<p>破敵乏術　　此次巨人之演出，並無理想之妙，大致亦為久疏練習之原因。不論其攻守滯於太公式型，尤以進攻時之立定位置，作無謂之消耗傳遞，籍以誘敵，造成空隙而入華聯如其所以，應以急逼，無不成功，奈不此之圖耶！巨人守衛時之呆，更甚於攻，則華聯如多作迅速敏捷之傳遞，獲籃自多。要之，華聯之所以如此者，或以合作方面之吃虧耳。</p>
<p>綜論，以華聯出塲之人選而談，應可取勝巨人，終於敗矣，無復何言。夫滬上室內比賽，嗣後以塲地關係，不能再見，將一以此一戰為最後之一幕，而華聯之未能擊退巨人，不能無憾。</p>
<p>最後，對於此次策動慈善賽之華聯藥廠，主持人張溎祥之熱心奔波，各球員之臨陳及球迷之踴躍織將，應代南市國際救濟醫院及黎民醫院致謝，問接亦病人之福，球壇有此項慈舉，誠善舉也。（聲）</p>
<h3>談羽毛球（二）</h3>
<p>— 康</p>
<p>總而言之，若是一個人，每天能够流黃汗一大身，那麼體內溫度，一定保持在平衡綫上，決不會有過高過低的體溫。因為汗中的物質，巳經排泄出來，不至於傷害血球，糖尿病。黃疸病，都是汗中含有雜質，而不注意輸達皮膚呼吸器管的明設，還有紅汗，是汗中含有血質。</p>
<p>用藥來刺激汗神經，總比不上運動身體，問接運用汗神經而流汗的好，須知藥物的刺激，是不得已而用的，不合天然的規律的。藥物的刺激汗神經，雖則有利於流汗，未必無害於他種機能。但是運動而流汗，是有利無弊的。</p>
<p>肥胖的人，不但身體不活潑，不美觀。並且一到暑季，比不肥胖的人，格外不能耐氣侯之熱。大槪體肉的脂肪過多，體溫更熱，所以許肥人，多在暑天覺得十分難過，然而試模肥人的皮膚，確又甚凉。這就是脂肪酸不能十分向外散發的緣故</p>
<p>若是肥胖的人，能够時常運動這種球戲；那麼當玩球時，要迅速的擊球，趕快的奔跑，全神的注意。心理上，生理生，同時起極大的作用。所以流汗極多，把體內脂肪酸，盡量的蒸發出來，就能逐漸的減去過多的脂肪，使得身體不會十分肥胖，而變為很適宜的身材。並目經久的運動，全身各部的肌肉，漸漸堅實，脂肪去，而肌肉美，可以成美麗的身材。肥胖的靑年男女，大有裨益，試行之，當知效益不淺。</p>
<p>促道呼吸量</p>
<p>無論何人，一經猛烈的運動，各部細胞，立刻起燃燒的作用，那麼肺的呼吸量一定會大大的增加。呼吸量旣然增加，那末肺內不潔之氣，和新鮮空氣就急速地互相調換。血液自然淸潔，並且肺氣管，因震動極急，就伸縮極快，因此肺細胞也便强健。胸部的肌肉，因肺量呼吸作用，漸漸發達。胸部的肌肉漸美，肺部强健，肺病那裏會發生呢？所以這種運動，對於女子，更有特別的利益。况且吾國的女子，大多數胸部不發達，肺量不充足，易害肺癆病，可是這種運動確有非常的效益。因為常要接軍高球，身體就要仰向大空之後方，胸部因此擴張，十分有益。比較玩要排球還要好得多。惟已經害第二期肺病的人，就不可以運動，須俟病愈之後，才能玩要這種球戲。</p>
<p>運動全身肌肉</p>
<p>這種游戲，除特別發展胸部之外，也能够發達全身的肌肉。奔馳，跳躍，有益在下肢。左右側擊有益在腰部，挽救危球，或網前球等，有益於腹部。至於上肢，和下肢，更有直接的勇益，所以可惜的，只是一臂握怕，另一臂不能平均發達耳</p>
<p>這種游戲，球來得很快，要拍得球，很進很好，那全　經騐，以及眼睛的測斷力。不過要眼睛銳敏，也全　多運用眼睛，多練習視綫。因手睛不雖能然應看確，若是手不能應心，或腦神經交感遲鈍，便不能打得好球。我常常看許多初學的人，眼睛和手，不相應用的，這是習肌肉的和作筋，少練習運和動腦的緣故。</p>
<h3>籃球學理述要（十六）</h3>
<p>— 梁兆安</p>
<p>四，現代防守法</p>
<p>現代防守法，有所謂「人釘人」，五人分區聯防，及「人釘人」與分區聯防混合防守等法，但以前二種為最流行，茲分別撮要述之於下：</p>
<p>（甲）「人釘人」防守法</p>
<p>「人釘人」防守法之意義，即以本隊一人看守對方一人之謂也。其用法可因塲賽大時小間，之兩員實力，比賽時久方暫球，及對方之進攻法而異，大概最通用者，為下列數種。　以本隊員看守對方身材實力相等之隊員。　以前鋒看守敵之後衛，中鋒看守敵之中鋒，後衛看守敵之前鋒。　於本隊失球後，五人速退回後塲，待敵進攻，衝過中綫時，各人就近認定一人而看守之。以而四人各看守其附近之人，而留一人專責，嚴防籃下衝進之敵人。查前二種適合於塲地較小，敵弱我强，或實力相等，咸屬名將隊伍而不能彼此合作，或敵採用延誤時間，獲取分數勝利戰略時行之，後一種為節省氣力計，宜於塲地較大，敵强我弱，及離比賽時間告終尙遠之時採用之。</p>
<p>查「人釘人」防守法，有其長處，亦有其短處，必須善為運用，方能奏效。其長處在能配合對手之身材與能力而防守之，使各人能指定一人，專責防守，隨時可壓迫對方，急忙進攻，破壞其陣綫，使之無喘息之餘堆，幷在比賽中隨時隨地均可嚴防敵之行動。然其短處亦多，若支配不當，本隊隊員對敵方球員，個別實力懸殊，則易成漏洞，全隊發生危險。且此種守法，易為敵方用阻擋法攻破。因為用此法看守，必須隨同敵人全塲奔跑，彼步我步，彼易我觸趨及，身旣體而又多容易觸及對方身體犯規。</p>
<p>故採用「人釘人」防守之法，除全隊合力防守之外，個人防守技術，亦須善為運用。凡用此法防守者，着看人不看球，嚴密監視本人能應守之敵；本人所站之位置，應常保持在對手與敵籃之間，常據守內圈，壓迫敵近於邊綫，使敵不跑能至暢谷，更不能使敵跑至背後，而予以偷襲之機會。與對手距離之位置，視對乎技術之高下而定，敵比我總敏者，宜離之較遠，敵比我遲鈍者，則宜稍近，幷可急速上前，裝虛作勢，使其惶恐銷亂，乘機奪獲其球。對手若無球在手，可任其奔跑，本人則覓適常地點而監視之，不必跟隨其跑，以省氣力；如對方持球在手，則非嚴防不可。防守時之態度，極宜鎭靜，如被對方裝　欺騙，留惠對方行阻接法，幷須常注意對手之眼光與脚步，預為猜定其傳球，或逃脫之直路綫，以便堵戰及奪球。</p>
<p>（乙）五人分區聯防法</p>
<p>所謂五人分區聯防法者，即在本隊後塲，劃分為五區，而以一人專責防守一區之謂也。其陣綫可分為：　前列三人，後列二人。　前列二人，後列三人。　前列二人，中列一人，後列二人等數種。而以前一種為最通用，其佈陣方法，在本隊一失球，五人即速退回後塲，兩後衛先退至敵籃前，與罰球綫之間，各佔左右半塲地而防守之。中鋒及兩前鋒，退至中綫與罰球綫之當中，三人橫排塲中，兩前鋒各據守左右兩翼，中鋒則鎭守中央，以待對方前來進攻。</p>
<p>迨至敵來攻時，防守之法，亦可分為三種；　以一人防守一區，即各人負查監視走入其防守區內之敵人。　以後列兩術，各監視從前錄左右身邊衝進之第一人，前列前鋒，各看守從其左右身邊　　之第二人，或最後衝進之一人，中鋒負責監守，從其左右身衛之第三人，或最後一人。　以掉換防區，互相呼應之法，三重防守之，即隨球來之方向，轉移陣綫，以便最少有三人，對着球來之路綫。球而分作三重防守，使持球之敵，不易深入襲擊也</p>
<h3>體壇什錦</h3>
<p>三省體有會有田徑隊足球隊，女子藍排球隊，成績均斐然可觀，而精神尤佳，尤足可取。茲悉日前該會又成立男子排球隊，延鄧效良為管理，推張瑞為隊長。按鄧君辦事幹練，張瑞之球藝超羣，是則該隊之前途，必甚燦爛。</p>
<p>女子藍球久寂，今日下午四時在國强中學有綠隊對雪白友誼賽，歡迎參觀，球述當樂予往觀。並聞新嫁娘戲蔚委，或有下塲作戰之可能。</p>
<p>乒乓界活躍份子傳桂卿，前任職於信中錢莊，茲榮任浙江勸工銀行業務部副經理之戰，對乒乓甚極熱心。正在籌辦浙勸乒乓隊，當可稱雄銀錢界</p>
<p>泰山路遠東食堂，幾成為體壇人士之會食所，中北之外，華聯張溎祥，晨友瞿堯康·絲隊王網乾。上女祝士芳等時作座上客。</p>
<p>球人跑外埠者極多，如陳中往返於上海太倉之間，另圖新發展。高保正則來往無錫，略具單帮性質。陳頌良則在崇明上海來去，隨帶少數貨物，以資盈利。（和）</p>

<h3>Okinawa Island Southern Gunfire Ceaseless: Japanese Troops Valiantly Fighting, High Morale Ensuring First Line of Defense</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The enemy American forces in the southern part of Okinawa Island are attempting to replenish their losses in operations in that area by vigorously advancing and transporting artillery and military supplies, and are intent on preparing for an attack. On the morning of the 19th, the enemy again began attacking with several thousand tanks and approximately ten thousand infantry troops. From dawn, the sound of gunfire from both sides continued without interruption, engaging in a fierce and intense battle. The Japanese army continued to ensure the first line of defense, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy that evening, repelling them before the lines. Dozens of enemy tanks were left sitting inside the defensive positions, and the human losses were also extremely numerous. Meanwhile, approximately one thousand enemy troops who landed on Ie Island have been engaged by the Japanese army in fierce fighting. As of now, the enemy forces landed around Okinawa Island have reached approximately six divisions. The officers and soldiers of the Japanese army's first line have very high morale and are currently fighting valiantly. In addition, at sea, especially towards Minatogawa and the Itokazu area two kilometers northeast of it, the naval bombardment became even more intense on the 19th.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Minister Anami Issues "Decisive Battle Instruction"</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese Army authorities, with the war pressing close to Okinawa, a part of the Japanese mainland, specially formulated a "Decisive Battle Instruction," which was recently issued to the entire army by Army Minister Anami, explaining the path forward for Japanese soldiers. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese soldiers should uphold the Emperor's command, consistently adhere to the belief that the Divine Land will never perish, faithfully carry out their duties, and the foundation of victory lies in this.</p>
<p>Japanese soldiers should defend the national territory to the death, for the national territory is the location of the Emperor's residence and the sacred site where deities are enshrined. They must repel foreign invaders, and even if their bodies die, their spirits will remain to protect it.</p>
<p>Japanese soldiers should be fully prepared, and through training focused on certain victory and certain death, build impregnable fortresses.</p>
<p>Japanese soldiers should uphold the spirit of suicidal attacks, which is the tradition of Japanese warriors. With this, they will kill and exterminate all who invade the national territory, leaving none alive to return.</p>
<p>Japanese soldiers should be the vanguard of one hundred million comrades. One hundred million compatriots are all comrades protecting Japan. Under strict military discipline, they should develop comradeship, display the true character of the Japanese army, and take the lead in completing the great national task.</p>
<h3>Special Attack Forces Launch Large-Scale Raids, Heavily Damaging Enemy Ships off Okinawa: War Situation Enters a Stage Favorable to Japan</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency Telegram) - In the air battles around Okinawa Island, since the 16th, the enemy has increasingly shown signs of confusion. The war situation has entered the final stage favorable to Japan. Repeatedly, Japanese special attack forces have launched fierce attacks, inflicting severe blows on the enemy mobile units east of Okinawa and the enemy ship groups around Okinawa Island. In particular, the enemy's aircraft carrier losses have been even more severe, with thirteen sunk, two sunk or destroyed, and six destroyed, totaling twenty-one. Other battleships, cruisers, etc., sunk or destroyed have reached three hundred and seventy-two, among which several are likely to be aircraft carrier types. Calculating in this way, the losses of aircraft carriers are close to thirty. Local propaganda loudly announced the deployment of one thousand four hundred ships, but so far half have been lost, and the local panic can be imagined. Since March 23rd, based on confirmed war results, four hundred ships have been sunk. Calculating at two thousand men per ship, the enemy personnel losses are around eight hundred thousand. The enemy may be able to deploy some more ships in the future, but the replenishment of manpower will certainly not be so simple. Therefore, for the enemy, the most difficult thing to cope with is the great bloodshed.</p>
<p>Army Aviation Base, 20th (Central News Agency Telegram) - At the turning point of the decisive battle on Okinawa Island, Japanese special attack forces continue to launch large-scale raids, inflicting severe bloodshed and damage on enemy ships. However, the enemy is still stubbornly clinging to the island's surrounding waters, gathering a large fleet of more than two hundred main battleships, still attempting a desperate attack. It has been more than twenty days since the landing on Okinawa Island on April 1st. The enemy's landing force here is said to be the Navy's 11th and 6th Divisions and the 24th Army's 7th, 27th, 77th, and 96th Divisions, a total of six divisions, numbering approximately one hundred thousand. The enemy has occupied both the northern and central airfields and has already begun using them. The Japanese ground defense forces have launched daring counterattacks against them daily, inflicting great damage on the enemy. According to the announcement of the General Headquarters, the enemy's personnel losses have reached approximately one thousand. At the same time, Japanese special attack forces have also launched raids daily, and the number of enemy ships sunk to the bottom of the sea has reached four hundred, which is rare in the history of war. However, the enemy's ambition has not been abandoned, and they still strongly desire to launch repeated fierce attacks. In the end, the two sides will fight, and the one that remains will win. Although the enemy's material supplies are maintained with difficulty, their ships are ultimately limited. However, the spirit of the Japanese special attack forces is unlimited. At present, the Japanese special attack forces are by no means few. The entire aviation unit has become special attack members, resolved to fight to the last soldier, hoping to achieve final victory.</p>
<h3>New-Type Meteor Bomb: Aircraft Used by Japanese Kamikaze Corps Have Excellent Performance and Tremendous Destructive Power</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report - According to a United Press report from Kunming on the 17th, the large-scale production of new-type aircraft used by the Japanese Kamikaze corps is as follows: Japan is now manufacturing a large number of special suicidal aircraft in factories in Manchuria and training suicide pilots in preparation for using them as secret retaliatory weapons in the future. Therefore, this weapon, which will appear in East Asia in the future, has greater destructive power than the V1 and V2 meteor bombs used by the German army in Europe. According to reliable sources, the special suicidal aircraft currently being manufactured on a large scale in Manchuria can carry one ton (i.e., two thousand two hundred pounds) of bombs. This type of bomb is installed in front of the driver's seat, and explodes immediately when the nose or wing tip hits a solid object. The performance of this type of aircraft is extremely excellent. Its speed in level flight is four hundred miles per hour, and its speed can increase to six hundred miles per hour during a headlong dive. The pilots are mostly young people aged eighteen to twenty-five. They do not carry parachutes. When taking off from the ground, they abandon the wheels, hoping never to return. Because they do not consider the return route, their sortie distance is quite long. This type of aircraft can launch a new type of popular single cloud cloud.</p>
<h3>Japanese 200-Yen Note to Circulate in the Market</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Japan will soon have a Bank of Japan 200-yen note circulating in the market. The new note is larger than the 100-yen note. The front is light orange-yellow, with a portrait of Duke Fujiwara no Kamatari on the right side and the Tanzan Shrine's worship hall on the left side. The back is navy blue, with an image of the thirteen-storied pagoda of the shrine on the left side.</p>
<h3>Chairman of Japanese Local Council Promoted to Imperial Appointment; Lifesaving Ordinance to be Implemented Today</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese government, due to the increasingly intense war situation, in order to strengthen the defense posture, and from the perspective of enhancing military demand and food production, plans to strengthen and expand local administration. Therefore, the local officials of the Chairman of the Administrative Council are appointed as imperial officials, and the location of the Local Administrative Council will be adjusted according to the actual situation. After being submitted for discussion at the Privy Council meeting on the 18th, it was seconded and decided at the regular cabinet meeting on the 20th. Several orders related to this case will be announced in the official gazette on the 21st and implemented on the same day. There are three articles in the imperial edict related to this time, and the main points are as follows:</p>
<p>The transportation relations and military districts in Shikoku should be considered, and the location of the Shikoku Administrative Council should be moved from Ehime Prefecture to Kagawa Prefecture.</p>
<p>The status of the Hokkaido Governor and Prefectural Governors, who are the chairmen of the Local Administrative Councils, will be promoted to newly appointed officials.</p>
<p>When the Chairman of the Local Administrative Council concurrently serves as the Director of the Maritime Transport Bureau, the position of the Director of the Maritime Transport Bureau, which was originally a second-class high-ranking official, may be promoted to a first-class high-ranking official.</p>
<h3>Japanese Regular Cabinet Meeting</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese government's regular cabinet meeting was held at 10:00 a.m. on the 20th. First, Director-General Akinaga of the Comprehensive Planning Bureau explained in detail the key points of the evacuation emergency measures to adapt to the current situation. After it was decided, various current issues were discussed, and the meeting did not adjourn until 6:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Expectations of the People's Congress</h3>
<p>The People's Congress of the United National Salvation Movement, following the Wartime People's Representative Congresses of various provinces and cities, will be held simultaneously in various provinces and cities across the country today. At this time when the situation is extremely serious, the holding of people's congresses in various localities is of great significance. We, considering the overall situation, cannot refrain from speaking on several points, and we respectfully offer them to the representatives of the people's congresses of various provinces and cities.</p>
<p>The holding of the People's Congress aims to concentrate the power of the people to assist the government's established national policies, overcome difficulties together, reverse the critical situation, and achieve the goal of uniting the country and saving the nation. Therefore, its only highest goal is to adapt to the current situation's requirements and solve all practical problems.</p>
<p>The biggest problem facing our country at present is how to fulfill the Sino-Japanese alliance treaty and assume the obligation of participating in the war. To solve this practical problem, it is by no means a sincere declaration and colorful slogans; it is by no means a paper of empty resolutions. The most urgent thing is to discuss how to realize the national material mobilization, because at present, only the thorough material mobilization can generate the power to cooperate in the war, can be said to assume the responsibility of participating in the war, and can solve the biggest external problem.</p>
<p>Among domestic problems, the most serious is still the problem of people's livelihood, which is also the problem of production. Due to the widespread stagnation and even suspension of production in various parts of the peace zone centered on Shanghai, it has evolved into a serious price problem, and further evolved into social and even political problems in which the vast majority of people cannot make a living. All phenomena that violate wartime national policies, such as corruption and malfeasance in some political circles, hoarding and speculation among the people, and all selfish and profiteering behaviors in society, are becoming more and more intense and serious as a result. Therefore, the People's Congress must have specific opinions on how to restore production and increase production, and discuss practical and effective methods, so that it can be realized in the short term with the consistent cooperation of the Sino-Japanese military, political, and civilian sectors.</p>
<p>At present or in the future, if materials cannot be quickly and thoroughly mobilized, it is not enough to say that the responsibility of participating in the war is assumed; if production cannot be quickly restored and increased, it is not enough to say that the problem of people's livelihood is solved. If the responsibility of participating in the war cannot be assumed, and the problem of people's livelihood cannot be solved, then all our people's movements and political movements will lose their basis. Any declaration and resolution cannot solve the current practical problems at home and abroad. Therefore, what we expect from the People's Congresses held separately in various provinces and cities today is only the above two points.</p>
<p>The People's Congress of the United National Salvation Movement, as the name implies, in addition to solving the current practical problems at home and abroad, seems to have a more far-reaching goal, to promote the national united salvation movement through the activities of the People's Congresses in various provinces and cities in the peace zone; but we must recognize the complexity of China's international relations and domestic politics today. To be in a superior position in these two aspects and form a leader in the national united salvation, it first depends on whether there is a practical solution to internal and external practical problems? If the current practical problems cannot be solved, that is, the task of participating in the war cannot be fulfilled externally, and the promotion of production to relieve the suffering of people's livelihood cannot be achieved internally, that is, the unanimous belief of the people cannot be obtained, then meetings that are merely formalities cannot achieve practical results. This is also what we sincerely advise the People's Congress and the government authorities. The times are dangerous and the situation is urgent. We sincerely hope that the government and the public will encourage each other in a timely manner!</p>
<p>Travel Correspondence</p>
<h3>Governor Hao Pengju Talks about the Administrative Policy of the Huaihai Provincial Government: Huaihai Travel Notes 4</h3>
<p>— Yifei</p>
<p>Governor Hao Pengju continued: Since I took over Huaihai's administration, its administrative policy has roughly included the following points. However, to achieve what is desired, it is not only necessary to look at the efforts of the political personnel, but also to rely on the cooperation of the people of the province. Now, I will speak separately:</p>
<p>Training the people: This layer has already achieved considerable results. Taking Xiao County as an example, more than 160,000 people have been trained. Other counties are also promoting it. In this way, the situation below can be communicated to the top, and the situation above can be announced to the bottom, so that the effect of official-civilian cooperation can be achieved.</p>
<p>Revitalizing the rural economy: To make people's lives stable, it is necessary to vigorously promote cooperative undertakings. Currently, the capital of the Huaihai Cooperative is 600 million, which has achieved considerable results in revitalizing the rural economy.</p>
<p>Popularizing education: According to Huaihai's past environmental relations, it has created a low cultural level. During the Qing Dynasty, there were insulting comments on the people of Huaihai, but the giant wheel of the times has turned Huaihai to the bright side. In recent years, the provincial government has the greatest determination for the work of popularizing people's education and has spared no effort in carrying it out, hoping to make the people interested in politics so that they can exert and realize the spirit of democracy. As for the work of educating children, it has been quite effective in recent years. At present, the enrollment of school-age children has increased by more than 20% compared with before. In addition, the teachers' treatment, except for their remuneration, is the same as that of civil servants. For the sake of preferential treatment, each person is allocated 70 to 140 kilograms of wheat per month so that they can concentrate on serving. Unfortunately, due to the lack of funds and building materials, although the number of students has increased in recent years, the school buildings cannot be expanded. The system of entering school in the morning and afternoon has been implemented, which is only a temporary transitional measure. In addition, Huaihai's highest institution of learning is the "Huaihai College," which is the place to train economic and administrative professionals. As for the Yunlong College, which is being planned, it is the future Huaihai University.</p>
<p>Opening up transportation and rectifying the customs: In the past, Huaihai's transportation was quite backward, so the customs were also very simple and unsophisticated, which cannot be denied. Now, the provincial government, on the one hand, has made a comprehensive plan for transportation construction and has put it into practice one by one. For example, the expansion of the roads in Xuzhou, the provincial capital, Lianyungang. Nanjing-Pukou. The main lines of Huaiyin and other places have also been completed to make a strong contribution to provincial defense. People's livelihood. The exchange of foreign materials, etc., can make a strong contribution. As for guiding the customs, the provincial government, in addition to vigorously encouraging the preservation of the inherent simplicity, hard work, and other good points, also implements the prohibition of opium and gambling. And officials and soldiers must strictly implement the "Huaihai Provincial Military and Political Personnel's Reform of Life Covenant" that I personally set. If there is any intentional violation, they will be dealt with according to military law. Without talking about the past, recently, a special agent chief in Xiao County violated the oath and has been executed. The battalion vice-commander of his superiors was also guilty of improper management and was detained for punishment. In the future, we will continue to follow the original purpose and select officials and officers according to their talents and will never be influenced by personal feelings. After the selection, they will also be made to understand the times and to assume the responsibility of protecting the country and the people.</p>
<p>In terms of cooperation in the war, the province has successively built hospitals, barracks, repair shops, clothing factories, leather factories, etc., most of which are in a certain place. The rest are scattered everywhere. As for military education institutions, there are military cadre training groups, anti-communist training groups, and training classes for various departments such as management personnel, machine guns, and ordnance, to create technically excellent military personnel who will never disturb the people.</p>
<h3>Halsey's Selection Reveals American Ambition</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 20th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a New York dispatch on the 19th, Halsey, commander of the U.S. Pacific Third Fleet, wrote in the recently published Collier's magazine that the United States will absolutely not allow Japan to propose a formal peace treaty. The peace treaty instead puts Japan in a "truce state" for a long time. All Japanese who are war criminals should be severely punished, regardless of their status and without any consideration. To retaliate for the American soldiers killed by the Japanese army in the Pacific, the only way we can deal with the Japanese army is by execution. It is not only me who hates the Japanese. All the officers and soldiers under my command have the same feeling. The United States should incapacitate the Japanese nation and must make it unable to do so for a long time. Therefore, the following measures must be taken: Without the recognition of the anti-Axis countries, Japan cannot use a single ship. Deprive all Japanese of their weapons. Deprive Japan of all war attack materials.</p>

<h3>The Battle for Berlin Reaches its Climax: Soviet Forces Establish a Bridgehead on the Warta River</h3>

Fuehrer Hitler issued an order to all soldiers on the Eastern Front on the 16th, vowing to defend the homeland to the death, and said, "The German army should prevent German women from being insulted by Red Army soldiers," his words being especially tragic. Whether the German army and civilians can stop the Red Army's offensive by displaying the spirit of defending the homeland can be determined in the battles of the next four or five days.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 20th (Central News Agency telegram) - Huitong News Agency reports that Moscow announced yesterday for the first time that the Soviet army has begun its major offensive towards Berlin, stating that the Soviet army has established a bridgehead on the Warta River west of Küstrin. Large-scale battles have broken out at various bridgeheads on the Warta River and the Neisse River.</p>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to front-line reports: The battle for Berlin has reached its climax. In the past 24 hours, Soviet forces have concentrated massive amounts of equipment and penetrated deep into German positions.

German forces near the Frankfurt-on-the-Oder area in the southern wing have withdrawn from the bridgehead on the east bank of the Warta River and destroyed the bridges over the river.</p>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency telegram) - Huitong News Agency reports: In the past 24 hours, Soviet forces have increased pressure on Berlin. Although the enemy spared no sacrifice in fierce attacks, they ultimately failed to achieve a strategic breakthrough. On both sides of the Küstrin-Berlin highway, Soviet forces have made slight progress. Fierce fighting is taking place east of Buckow and 4 kilometers northeast of Müncheberg. The Soviet vanguard is still 50-60 kilometers away from Berlin. In the area north of the Reichenow-Strausberg highway, the Soviet vanguard has also crossed Reichenow by several kilometers.

The Red Army has launched a major offensive between Baden and Sankt Pölten (west of Vienna). Therefore, the Soviet army has launched a general offensive in all areas except the Stettin area.</p>

<h3>Germany Determined to Make a Final Effort to Break the Current Crisis: Goebbels Says the End of the War is Near</h3>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency telegram) - Huitong News Agency reports: German Minister of Propaganda Goebbels delivered a radio address to the German people on the eve of Fuehrer Hitler's 56th birthday, stating that although the current war situation is serious, international Jewry will never achieve its goal of destroying the world. Fuehrer Hitler will surely lead the people into the most developed period of the German nation and culture. The German people are facing an unprecedented crisis and will turn danger into safety with a final effort. Germany failed to seize the final decision in the First World War, so it is inevitable that it will make double and triple efforts in the Second World War. The current war is coming to an end. The madness of the enemy has passed its peak. The combination of plutocracy and Bolshevism has begun to collapse. Fuehrer Hitler escaped safely on July 20 last year, which is clearly a blessing from God to enable him to fulfill his mission. Europe will surely establish order, peace, and prosperity. Some people may slander him now, but they will eventually deeply regret it. He is the central force to prevent the collapse of the world and the most courageous leader of the German people. Germany will surely achieve victory.</p>
<h3>U.S. Attempts to Occupy Pacific Islands</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 20th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to a Washington report, after the U.S. House of Representatives passed a naval budget bill totaling more than $24.8951 billion on the 19th, it was submitted to the Senate. During the discussion of the budget bill, almost all members of the House of Representatives demanded that the United States occupy various Pacific islands after the war. A Republican member elected from New York stated: "Iwo Jima, Saipan, the Mariana Islands, the Caroline Islands, and other islands were occupied by the American army at the cost of a large amount of blood and sweat, so the United States should have the right to hold these islands." A Democratic member elected from Montana stated: "In order to safeguard the security of the United States in the Pacific, it is also permissible for the United States to incorporate the islands under Japanese mandate into the territory of the United States." It is expected that the Budget Committee may formally propose a plan to occupy Pacific islands due to the proposal of the House members.</p>
<h3>Enemy U.S. Warships Suffer Heavy Losses</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency telegram) - Enemy powerful mobile units appeared in the southwest islands on March 23 and began landing on the Kerama Islands. Since the enemy invaded Okinawa, a month has passed in an instant, and the decisive battle has not yet reached its climax. A large-scale war of attrition, the likes of which have never been seen before on land, sea, and air, will unfold in that area. The losses suffered by the enemy during this period, based solely on confirmed sinkings, have reached 400 enemy warships. However, the enemy's attempts do not seem to have been thwarted. They continue to reinforce the landing forces and strengthen the supply ships. The enemy, both the United States and America, are blindly bombing the Japanese side with a large number of carrier-based aircraft, and their determination to seize Okinawa is very strong. The future course of the war is still not to be taken lightly. Although the enemy has boastfully mobilized more than 1,400 ships for this operation and exaggerated the pouring in of huge amounts of materials, the fact is that the sinking and destruction of ships has had a considerable impact on the operation, especially the large loss of aircraft carriers, battleships, cruisers, and destroyers, which has greatly hindered the enemy's invasion. After all, in naval invasion operations, the mission of warships is extremely important, whether it is to protect the landing forces during the start of the landing operation or to protect transport convoys. Without warships, basic operations are impossible.</p>
<h3>The Anguish of America</h3>
<p>— Tadahisa Matsudaira</p>
<p>It has been more than eight years since I left America, and my knowledge of various aspects of the United States is quite outdated. However, during my stay in the United States, I shook hands with the late Roosevelt, attended banquets hosted by Ambassador Saito, and spoke with various cabinet members such as Wallace, Morganthau, Ickes, and Ms. Perkins, and often attended their meetings in the Washington Congress. I also went to the State Department for relatively unimportant negotiations and spoke with the head of the Far East Bureau or the head of the Japanese section from a public standpoint. Therefore, compared to people who have never been to the United States, I have a considerable interest in and attention to the United States. Now, I will use the knowledge I gained in the past to talk about the most distressing issue facing America during wartime.</p>
<p>I myself admit that America is a great tree of democracy. They also boast and praise themselves for respecting public opinion, respecting human rights, and being a country of the common people. The fact is indeed so. Looking at American history, they left Europe due to religious oppression and economic insecurity and migrated to the American continent. Because they could not bear the tyrannical rule of the British mainland and were stimulated by the French Revolution, they launched a war of independence, eliminated all monarchical institutions, and built a country of the common people. Therefore, their political organization is one of mutual restraint, in order to prevent autocracy. Thus, American politics boasts the separation of powers.</p>
<p>The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Has a Lofty Position</p>
<p>When I went to America, I saw that the position of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court was very high, second only to the President, and surpassing the position of the Chief Justice of the Japanese Supreme Court by tens of millions. At that time, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court was Hughes, who was qualified as Secretary of State and had high experience and prestige. I once asked law students, "What do you hope to do after you graduate?" Many students replied interestingly, "I want to be the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court." Indeed, the American judicial power is strictly independent, always maintaining consistent legal dignity, planning for the people, and preventing autocracy everywhere. But I think this may be the main factor hindering the United States from carrying out the war. Recently, a famous department store in Chicago had a labor dispute. Because they did not obey the government's orders, the government took over the company's factory. The owner then sued the court, demanding that the government return the factory. The court ruled that the government's measures were improper, causing the government to lose the lawsuit. Such litigation is probably rare in the United States, but the government has expressed dissatisfaction and filed an appeal, requesting repeated retrials. The case has not yet been resolved. It can also be seen here that a certain degree of dictatorial political organization is necessary during wartime, but the arrogance of the judicial organ hinders government action, which has become a real problem for the United States.</p>
<p>Congress Monitors the President's Actions</p>
<p>Secondly, the legislative power, which holds great power, is the so-called Congress. Congress is the power that restrains the government—that is, the President—and closely monitors the President's actions. Among them, the Senate has even greater power. Even important issues such as declaring war or making peace are invalid without the support of two-thirds of the Senate. When President Wilson organized the League of Nations and returned home, he did not receive two-thirds of the support, so he could not join the League.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Congress also has the right to freely amend wartime legislation proposed by the government. For example, in the recent National Conscription Act, the government originally stipulated citizens over the age of 18, but Congress amended it to citizens over the age of 19. At that time, members of Congress received many letters of opposition from farmers in the electoral districts, which were either publicly disclosed in Congress or published in newspapers and magazines, attacking the government's plans and forcing the government to change its plans. In addition, Congress also has the right to reject important policies implemented by the President, and important personnel must also be understood by the Congress. Therefore, the government is most difficult to deal with Congress, especially if the President is a mediocre person, then Congress will monitor more closely, and all wartime measures will be very difficult to implement.</p>

<h3>Finance Bureau Plans to Adjust Property and Land Taxes to Increase City Treasury Revenue: Director Luo Jian Attends Routine Press Conference and Speaks</h3>
<p>The 13th routine press conference hosted by the City Propaganda Office was held at 10:00 AM yesterday (20th) in the City Government conference room. Those present included City Finance Bureau Director Luo Jian, Chief Secretary Xu Songping, City Propaganda Office Director Liu Dexuan, and more than a dozen reporters from various newspapers. Director Luo answered the questions raised by the reporters regarding the Finance Bureau's established budget, balanced revenue and expenditure, consumption, business, and license taxes, as well as the allocation of tax revenue, in detail. The following is a summary:</p>
<p>Various Taxes</p>
<p>(Question) What are the results of the Finance Bureau's efforts to adjust various taxes? (Answer) For various taxes, in addition to adjusting the license fee rates, increasing the special retail consumption tax on goods from 4% to 5%, raising the assessed value of various business taxes, and launching the business tax in the old one-eight districts, all other taxes are collected according to the old regulations. However, we are making every effort to pay attention to tax evasion by taxpayers and embezzlement of tax revenue by collection agents, as well as corruption by illegal collection personnel. Since March, tax revenue has increased significantly.</p>
<p>(Question) How many cases of businesses found to have evaded taxes have been punished, and what is the total number up to the middle of this month? Is all the fines deposited in the city treasury or are they used for other purposes? (Answer) The total amount of fines imposed on merchants for embezzling special consumption tax from November 16, 1944 to April 15, 1945, was more than 31,017,000 yuan, of which 11,700,000 yuan has been paid. As for the entertainment venues that violated regulations and evaded taxes, there were a total of 49 cases up to the middle of this month, and the fines imposed amounted to more than 16,859,000 yuan, of which more than 3 million yuan has not been paid. According to regulations, this fine is first deposited in the city treasury, but a portion may be used to reward informants and those who have contributed to the case.</p>
<p>(Question) What is the recent situation of the special consumption tax collection? What is the reason for the recent revision of the tax rates for retail goods and restaurant banquets special consumption tax? (Answer) The collection of the special consumption tax has been improving every month. In March, including the amount to be transferred to the Ministry, a total of 950 million yuan was collected. The reason for the revision of the tax rates this time is that the tax rates on luxury goods were too heavy, and legitimate transactions decreased. In addition, the progressive tax rates adopted by restaurants and hotels were too high and easily led to merchants taking advantage of loopholes to evade taxes or embezzle them. We have submitted a request to the central government for correction.</p>
<p>(Question) The deadline for reporting and paying the business tax is the end of this month. How much tax has been received so far? What is the total budgeted amount for the collection of this tax? What is the total amount that has been declared and calculated so far? (Answer) Since the launch of the spring business tax in the former one-eight districts, merchants have been enthusiastically applying for and paying taxes. Currently, more than 360 million yuan has been collected, and it is expected that 900 million yuan can be collected each quarter.</p>
<p>(Question) How is the performance of the special consumption tax collection offices for fresh meat set up by your bureau in the urban area? It is said that the office collects donations from the suburbs on a daily basis based on the land. Are the numbers of fresh pigs actually sold and reported accurately? (Answer) After the collection of the special consumption tax on pork was delegated to the same industry association, a total of more than 89 million yuan in tax revenue was paid in January and February. Both the urban and suburban areas collect and remit as much as possible based on the number of pigs.</p>
<p>(Question) What about the experience and ability of the newly trained tax personnel who have graduated from the crash course? Are you satisfied with their work performance? (Answer) The newly trained tax investigators have relatively shallow experience and ability due to the short training period. However, after being assigned to work, most of them are able to work hard and their performance is still good.</p>
<p>(Question) In recent months, various restaurants, theaters, etc., have been fined tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, or millions for embezzling special taxes. In terms of severely punishing unscrupulous merchants' psychology of tax evasion, it is indeed well deserved, but the numbers are quite large. What is your bureau's opinion? (Answer) The cases in which our bureau punishes merchants for violating regulations and embezzling tax revenue are all handled in accordance with the established rules. The multiples of all punishments are calculated lightly and according to the lowest multiples. However, because the amount of tax embezzled by the merchants is very large, according to the special consumption tax regulations, they must be fined ten to twenty times the amount of tax evaded. Therefore, the amount of the fine is very large. Our bureau has no right to reduce it, but in order to take into account the merchants' situation, we will consider allowing them to pay in installments. We hope that all merchants will be able to pay taxes in accordance with the regulations in the future to avoid being punished.</p>
<p>(Question) Your bureau sent personnel to collect special retail taxes from street vendors at the North Railway Station, but the attitude of the inspectors is not good. They do not explain the rules at first, and they often throw away chickens, fish, rice, noodles, etc. at will. This point should be corrected. If an office can be set up at the North Station, it would be easier to centralize management. (Answer) Our bureau has not sent personnel to collect special retail taxes from street vendors at the North Station. We have never considered this matter and will investigate it to find out the truth.</p>
<p>(Question) How is the performance of the finance bureaus of various counties in collecting the special retail and restaurant banquet consumption taxes since this month? (Answer) The special consumption tax of various counties has only recently been taken over by the county finance bureaus. The time is very short and no reports have been submitted to the bureau yet.</p>
<p>(Question) I recently learned that your bureau has announced the Ministry of Finance's amendment to the special consumption tax rate for banquets, changing the original 15% to 40% to 20%, and also levying 10% on meals for the poor. Ordinary people who eat a meal or snack at a street stall every day also have to bear such a heavy tax, which seems unbearable. May I ask if your bureau can cite past precedents and exempt ordinary meals from tax in order to reduce the burden on citizens? (Answer) Our bureau collects the special consumption tax in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry. Before we receive an order to allow tax exemption, we have no right to change the established rules.</p>
<p>(Question) In the past, when newly established merchants applied to your bureau for various business licenses, the date of application and the date of issuance were delayed by two or three months. During this period, your bureau has a regulation that does not allow applicants to operate in advance. Therefore, merchants cannot operate during this period, and the losses suffered are quite large. I wonder if your bureau can have a flexible solution in order to alleviate the difficulties of merchants? (Answer) Newly established merchants should first prepare a deposit and apply to our bureau for a business license. At the same time, our bureau will send a copy of the application to the relevant bureaus for review. If it is deemed to be in compliance with the regulations, our bureau will be notified to issue the license. Otherwise, the applicant must correct the procedures. Our bureau will never deliberately delay the issuance of licenses.</p>
<p>Current Situation of Land Tax</p>
<p>(Question) What is the performance of the land tax and other tax revenues in the counties under your jurisdiction since you took office? There were past cases of excessive collection. Has this been completely eliminated? (Answer) Our city's counties are currently preparing to collect land tax in kind. The amount of land tax arrears from previous years is still large. However, we have formulated measures to clear up the land tax arrears in various counties and dispatched personnel to the counties to clear up and urge payment. There were indeed cases of excessive collection in the past, but after investigation and strict handling, no similar cases have been discovered. We hope that all sectors of society will assist our bureau in reporting them at any time.</p>
<p>(Question) It is said that the police rice of various counties has been transferred to the direct collection of each county. How much is each county? Is the collection amount the same? Is the collected police rice converted into cash? What is the standard for the price? Is it clearly announced to prevent abuses? (Answer) The city government stipulates that the police rice of various counties should be temporarily borrowed by the counties from the townships according to the number of police officers and the amount of rice allocated. After the land tax in kind is collected this year, it will be planned and handled as a whole, and the borrowed rice will be returned to the people.</p>
<p>(Question) What is the performance of the land tax, treasure, and military police rice collected in various counties in 1944? (Answer) The tax revenue collected in various counties in 1944 was converted from kind into cash. The approved price of rough japonica rice was 1,800 yuan per stone, and it was collected according to the grade. (For example, if the land of a first-class household pays one dou of rice per mu, it will pay 180 yuan. The military rice fee is collected together with the land tax at 150 yuan per mu.) It was collected successively from October. Except for Fengxian and Shenjiang counties, whose performance was the last, the collection amount reached 90%. The remaining counties were between 50% and 70%, while Nanhui was less than 30%.</p>
<p>City Treasury Revenue and Expenditure</p>
<p>(Question) What are your opinions on establishing a budget and balancing revenue and expenditure? What new plans do you have for increasing the city treasury in the future? (Answer) The government establishes a budget in order to ensure that government revenue and expenditure are appropriate and to show that revenue and expenditure have a standard. However, balancing revenue and expenditure is a prerequisite for establishing a budget. Currently, the most urgent and unavoidable expenditures in our city are military and police expenses and highway construction expenses. Other expenses, such as the adjustment of civil servants' salaries and the increase in office expenses of various agencies due to rising prices, cannot be reduced. On the revenue side, production is stagnant, citizens' purchasing power is reduced, and the special consumption tax and business tax may decrease at any time. When budgeting, revenue and expenditure can still be balanced, and the budget can barely be established. However, the current economic situation is volatile, and there is a phenomenon that the budget may be broken and revenue and expenditure may be unbalanced at any time. The financial authorities must not only deal with the difficulties of the moment, but also have a long-term vision to adapt to the future environment. My plan for increasing the city treasury in the future is still focused on increasing revenue, and I plan to appropriately adjust the property and land tax. We are now actively planning and proceeding.</p>
<p>(Question) After the city government and its subordinate bureaus and offices implemented staff reduction and salary increase, how much has the salary expenditure increased compared to before? What is the total amount required per month? (Answer) After the city government and various bureaus and offices implemented staff reduction and salary increase, the monthly salary expenditure has increased significantly. Before the increase in salaries, the total amount of monthly salaries was more than 179 million yuan. After the salary increase, the total amount of monthly salaries was more than 599 million yuan, an increase of more than 419 million yuan per month.</p>
<p>(In addition, I asked) How is the public's subscription to the temporary relief bonds? What is the total amount sold so far? (Answer) Of the temporary relief bonds, 500 million yuan is collected by the Fuxing Bank, which has not yet been deposited in the treasury, and it is expected that all of them can be sold out.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's News from the County Administration: Police Affairs Discussion Meeting, Attendance and Reports from County Police Chiefs</h3>

<p>Secretary-General Luo's Instructions</p>
<p>First, Secretary-General Luo personally came to give instructions, giving detailed guidance on various points for reforming police affairs in each county. The gist of his instructions was roughly as follows: "To establish the scale of municipal and county administration in this city, the reform of police affairs should be the starting point. The various past undesirable phenomena of the police, such as colluding with bandits, preying on the people, and planting factions for personal gain, must be earnestly investigated and eliminated at all times, without being perfunctory, without making excuses, and without yielding to the environment, to effectively relieve the people's suffering and ensure their peace." Afterwards, Deputy Director Yi presided over the meeting (Director Cai was on sick leave and replaced by Deputy Director Tan), reporting the significance of the meeting.

<h3>Municipal District Deed Tax Changed to be Handled by the Finance Bureau</h3>
<p>Regarding the deed tax on the mortgage and sale of real estate, the central government has stipulated deed tax regulations that are uniformly followed nationwide. However, in the urban area of ​​this city, due to environmental factors, the Land Administration Bureau formulated the "Provisional Rules for the Levying of Real Estate Transfer Deed Tax in Shanghai" and handled it separately, which was originally a temporary measure of expediency. It is now known that the municipal government, in order to unify administration, has abolished the above-mentioned provisional rules for the transfer deed tax on real estate. All matters related to the deed tax on the mortgage and sale of real estate will be uniformly handled by the Finance Bureau in accordance with the tax regulations issued by the ministry. The two bureaus of finance and land have been ordered to hand over the matters separately and implement them immediately.</p>
<p>Exemption from Business Tax for Silk Factories</p>
<p>The Municipal Government of this city believes that silk factories have already paid a special tax on silkworms. This special tax is a central tax and is based on the price of silk as the completion standard. Its nature already includes business tax. Therefore, the Finance Bureau has been ordered to follow Article 18 of the Provisional Regulations for the Collection of Business Tax: "Where a factory or company and its affiliated offices have already paid a unified tax levied by the central government, they shall not be levied business tax again." Exemption from business tax is approved. However, the business of silk shops, which falls within the scope of promotion and sales, shall still pay business tax as required.</p>

<h3>Municipal Government Strictly Prohibits Military Personnel from Causing Trouble</h3>
<p>During the performance of Choi Seung-hee's dance at the Dahua Theater in this city on August 8, suddenly twenty or thirty people in Chinese naval uniforms, without purchasing tickets, tried to force their way into the theater, causing a conflict with the theater staff and smashing the windows. The theater filed a report with the municipal government requesting protection. In addition to sending a letter to the Navy Department to strictly order an investigation and prohibition, the municipal government also informed the police bureau that if similar incidents occur in the future, no matter who they are, they should immediately investigate the facts and detain the troublemakers for handling.</p>
<h3>Impersonating Military Police, Thugs Arrested</h3>
<p>Recently, there have been unscrupulous thugs in this city impersonating military police personnel, making rumors and swindling, intimidating and defrauding, and committing all kinds of evils. The military and police authorities have repeatedly issued orders for investigation and suppression. It is now known that a thug named Huang Shanren, alias Yongchuan, using the pseudonym "Xianguang", falsely claimed to be a secret agent of the Japanese Military Police and made rumors and swindled on a large scale. He went to restaurants such as Wanshoushan Dingxiang and cafes such as Queen's Fine Arts, as well as hotels such as Andong Da Xin Da Dong, and used the name of the Military Police to beat and use people, eat and stay without paying, and solicit prostitutes without paying. He defrauded tens of thousands of yuan from pawnshops such as Zhenkang Guangchang. The Police Bureau learned of the situation and arrested Huang in Room 214 of the Da Dong Hotel. Under strict interrogation, he confessed to more than a dozen cases. He has now been identified by the Lao Zha Branch and transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for handling. It is hoped that citizens will pay attention and report to the relevant branch if there are any thugs impersonating military police and defrauding them.</p>
<h3>Application Procedures for Municipal Public Cemetery Plots</h3>

After the section dispatches personnel to investigate and confirm, approval can be granted. After purchasing the plot, the burial must be completed within one month. If the deadline is exceeded, the bureau may confiscate the plot. The certified physician or medical practitioner must have a certificate from the Ministry of Health and a business license from the bureau to be valid. The bureau will not accept applications for plots entrusted to funeral homes, etc.</p>
<h3>To Stop Rising Prices, Three Steps, Director Chen Calls Director Xu to Discuss Countermeasures</h3>
<p>Due to the unreasonable surge in the black market for gold, other related financial stocks have also risen accordingly. Those who own wealth are all active in the speculative financial market. Now that the Chang Bureau has strictly suppressed speculative manipulation, the market traders and wealth owners have turned to material activities. Therefore, the general prices in this city have recently shown signs of restlessness. At this time, in the midst of the evacuation of the population in this city, citizens from other places are enthusiastically flocking to Shanghai. Since the population has decreased, the consumption of materials is lower than before, and prices will inevitably tend to fall due to the reduction in sales. The recent trend of rising prices is caused by the manipulation of general speculators and hoarders. Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry is paying close attention to the problem of rising prices. In order to prevent unscrupulous market traders from hoarding and manipulating, he recently summoned Director Xu of the Municipal Economic Bureau to discuss countermeasures for a long time. Minister Chen's instructions to stop rising prices were very detailed. According to the reporter's investigation, the contents of the countermeasures to suppress prices are roughly divided into three steps: implement price limits, strictly investigate hoarding, and implement registration. The Chang Bureau has issued orders to the competent authorities to comply with the instructions. According to the reporter's inquiry to the relevant economic authorities, all relevant authorities in this city have been in close contact and investigative preparation to prevent the trend of rising prices again. If illegal transactions exceeding the price limit or the purchase and hoarding of materials outside the industry are discovered, they will be punished by more severe means.</p>

<h3>Air Defense Headquarters Releases Points to Note for Citizens During Air Raids</h3>
<p>At 4:10 AM on the 15th of this month, an enemy plane invaded the airspace of this city, attempting to bomb the northern district of Shanghai. Fortunately, the bombs dropped fell on the road, only causing slight damage to a nearby house and some windows. The details have been released. The Civil Air Defense Headquarters of this city has released the following points based on the experience gained from the enemy plane's attack that day for future air defense work and hopes that citizens will pay attention to them.</p>
<p>Open Windows During Air Raids</p>
<p>The air vibration caused by the explosion of a bomb shattered the window glass within about 100 yards of the drop point. It can be seen that windows should be opened during air raids. If there is an external covering, the covering should be pulled open.</p>
<p>Arrange Furniture Every Night Before Bed</p>
<p>Building appropriate air raid shelters is undoubtedly important, but based on the experience gained from the enemy plane's attack that day, we deeply feel that residents should use any sturdy furniture in their homes as much as possible for shelter during air raids. Blankets and bedding can also be used as coverings to avoid flying glass fragments. Because it is impossible to predict when the enemy will attack, residents of this city must use all appropriate furniture in their homes to arrange them properly for protection during air raids every night before bed. If they encounter an air raid and do not have time to quickly go to the air raid shelter for shelter, temporarily sheltering beside street corners, high-rise buildings, and houses with crowded populations is also effective.</p>
<p>Place Air Defense Clothing Beside the Bed</p>
<p>When going to bed, air defense clothing or other clothing suitable for air defense work should be placed beside the bed. If a bomb falls and explodes nearby, shattering the windows of the house, residents inside should not walk barefoot in the room. Looking at the area where the bomb fell during the air raid on the 15th, many residents nearby were cut on their feet because they ran around barefoot in the dark searching for clothes. It can be seen the danger of this kind of action. The thicker the air defense clothing, the better. This point is also superfluous.</p>
<p>Store Glass Cups and Bottles Properly</p>
<p>When heavy bombs, such as those dropped in the daytime on that day, fall, in addition to the gale generated, the nearby area will also be subject to some vibration, which is enough to cause glass cups and bottles to fall and break. In order to protect these utensils from unnecessary damage, they should be stored in a safe place.</p>
<p>The Importance of Evacuating During Air Raids</p>
<p>The number of casualties during the air raid that day was very small, mostly because there were not many pedestrians on the road at that early morning hour. This shows the importance of evacuating during air raids. Citizens must know that during enemy air raids on this city, it is in their own interest to evacuate as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Investigate the Safety of Residents in the Bombed Area</p>
<p>After the air raid occurred that day, there seemed to be some confusion in the area near the bombed area. Therefore, after any bombing in the future, the first important step is to investigate whether the residents in the bombed area are safe, injured, or missing. At the same time, attention should also be paid to whether there is a fire. Any damage to gas pipes, electric wires, water pipes, and main water pipes should also be investigated to avoid waste and the occurrence of fires.</p>
<p>Have Sufficient Food and Drink for Several Days</p>
<p>All citizens must have sufficient water, at least enough for two or three days of drinking and cooking, and within a possible range, store emergency food that can be used for two or three days. Citizens in the bombed area will inevitably be busy with other work after the bombing and will not have time to go elsewhere to purchase daily necessities. We cannot determine the time and place of enemy air raids, so we must store large amounts of water in time for firefighting. As for the fact that every family must always prepare readily available air defense equipment, it goes without saying.</p>
<p>Stay Calm and Do Not Panic</p>
<p>After an air raid, citizens must not panic excessively, but should remain calm. Unnecessary panic or alarm will cause unnecessary damage. If you can remain calm as usual, you can be safe and sound.</p>
<p>Rotating Exhibition of Bombed Photos</p>
<p>(Another Report) The Civil Air Defense Headquarters of the city, in order to make citizens aware of the bombed situation, specially took various photos of the bombed area and rotated them to various districts for exhibition. They are now available for viewing in the lantern window of the Shanghai Electric Power Company at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Jiangxi Road.</p>

<h3>Rescue Medical Loan Office Established, Accepting Applications Regularly</h3>
<p>The Rescue Medical Loan Office, initiated by enthusiastic people in the society, aims to help poor patients. It will start accepting applications from the 23rd of this month. Those who reside in the old districts 1-8 and the factory, shop, and office workers and technicians in Zhabei, teachers and staff of schools, office workers of the Post Office and Customs, immediate family members and legally married spouses of the above three types of personnel, and students (limited to themselves) who suffer from acute internal medical diseases or surgical conditions requiring emergency surgery and cannot afford treatment may bring their residence permit to Room 319 on the third floor of No. 89 Sima Road (west end of Sichuan Road) every day from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM (closed on Sundays and holidays) to apply according to the regulations.

<p>Love of Compatriots: Mr. Lu Guannan wrote: "I have always admired your organization for its tireless efforts in social services and its remarkable achievements that have won the support and sympathy of all walks of life. In admiration, I will do my best to raise 200,000 Central Reserve Coupons to be used as various subsidies for your organization. Although this small amount will not help much, I hope that it will be accumulated to form a table and accumulate sand to form a tower. I hope that it will not be despised for its smallness. Please allocate the funds as follows: 100,000 yuan for the Shen Bao Scholarship, 50,000 yuan for the Shen Bao Medical Assistance Fund, and 50,000 yuan for the Shen Bao Midwifery Assistance Fund, totaling 200,000 yuan. I am sending a check, please check and issue a receipt." Mr. Lu's enthusiasm for good deeds and benefiting the poor is deeply admired.</p>

<h3>National Volunteer Corps of Japan</h3>
<p>To strengthen the homeland defense posture, the long-awaited "National Volunteer Corps" has finally been established. The following is a discussion with the authorities regarding its purpose, organization, and operation:</p>
<p>Question: What is the mission and purpose of the National Volunteer Corps?</p>
<p>Answer: The purpose of the National Volunteer Corps organization determined this time is to prepare for the defense of the homeland in cooperation with the military when the homeland becomes a battlefield. That is, to establish the so-called national total armed posture, to closely link defense and production, to strengthen it dramatically, and to prepare to complete the posture of everyone taking up arms in an emergency. However, the organization of the National Volunteer Corps is not an organization that immediately takes up weapons to engage in combat in an emergency. The armed team organization for that kind of occasion and its dispatch must be based on special measures of the law. In other words, the National Volunteer Corps is an organization that can be further transformed into an armed team to attack the enemy. Each member of the volunteer corps is to actively engage in the duties prescribed for them with the spirit of a first-line soldier engaging in hand-to-hand combat to protect the country.</p>
<p>In the event of an enemy landing, the task of supplementing the transportation of weapons, ammunition, and food to assist the military will of course require the organization of armed teams to execute, which will require special measures.</p>
<p>**Personnel from Various Industries are Organized into Teams**</p>
<p>Question: How is the Volunteer Corps organized?</p>
<p>Answer: The organization of the Volunteer Corps is in principle organized by city and village subdivisions. In addition, industrial sectors such as government offices, companies, factories, and enterprises that have a considerable number of personnel are also organized separately.</p>
<p>When organizing by occupation and region, care must be taken to avoid impairing production and other business operations. As for the Volunteer Corps organized by area such as urban areas and villages, the units are based on villages and neighborhood associations, with a minimum of ten to thirty people.</p>
<p>Furthermore, cooks form cooking teams, carpenters form work teams, and coachmen form transportation teams, and teams are organized according to their characteristics to make use of their special skills.</p>
<p>Question: What are the conditions for joining the Volunteer Corps?</p>
<p>Answer: Except for the elderly, the weak, and pregnant and lactating women, all men between the ages of graduation from elementary school in the national school system and 65, and women under the age of 45, must participate. However, women under the age of 44 who are the main members of the family are in principle not required to participate. As for schools, separate student teams are organized. If they are dispatched to perform the aforementioned work, they are members of the National Volunteer Corps.</p>
<p>The National Volunteer Corps organized in this way will have its headquarters in the metropolis, prefectures, and counties, and the local official will serve as the headquarters chief, governing the Volunteer Corps within the area. The heads of the city, ward, town, and village teams will be appointed by the mayors, ward chiefs, town chiefs, and village chiefs. The heads of the Volunteer Corps organized by the industrial sector will be appointed by the heads of the respective professional groups. In addition, those who are in a position to guide the Volunteer Corps will adopt a policy of encouraging knowledgeable people from both the government and the private sector to step forward and cooperate.</p>
<p>Question: What is the operational policy?</p>
<p>**To Assist in Various Tasks**</p>
<p>Answer: Regarding the military use of the Volunteer Corps, when dispatched to assist the military, they are under the command of the respective army and navy unit commanders; when dispatched to assist police defense activities, they are under the command of the respective government office chiefs; when dispatched to other tasks, they act according to the requirements of the respective construction or work implementers. The dispatch of the Volunteer Corps requires the army and navy unit commanders, government office chiefs, and construction or business implementers to request the local governor to dispatch them, and they act upon the local governor's order.</p>
<p>When organizing and operating, special attention should be paid to avoid friction with veterans' associations and fire brigades, in order to achieve both. In this organization, veterans and special fire brigade members participate as a whole. When not acting as a veteran or fire brigade member, they act as members of the Volunteer Corps. As for the relationship with existing organizations such as the Imperial Rule Assistance Association's young men's corps, the Industrial Patriotic Association, and the Commercial Patriotic Association, it is the same as before, and there is no hindrance even if they act as members of the Labor Patriotic Corps and the Women's Volunteer Corps.</p>
<p>Question: When is the best time to organize?</p>
<p>Answer: There is no deadline for when the Volunteer Corps organization will be completed. The local group is now taking a policy of immediate implementation. The National Volunteer Corps does not implement the dawn mobilization and formal training and ceremonies that were previously carried out by veterans' associations and the like.

<h3>Worthy of Imitation: Tokyo Air Defense Housing - "Tokyo Metropolitan Dugout" Construction Method</h3>
<p>The Tokyo Metropolitan Defense Bureau, regarding the housing problem for Tokyo citizens under arms, had previously designed a simple underground or semi-underground house that saves on materials and labor and is suitable for durability and blast resistance. It has now been completed and is called the "Tokyo Metropolitan Dugout," and has been publicly announced. On March 19, the Provisional Capital Assembly passed a budget of 5,344,000 yen for the capital authorities to first construct basic models for guidance in each district and township association, a total of several units in the entire city, and then guide the general public to construct them.</p>
<p>**Extremely Material-Saving**</p>
<p>The characteristic of this "Tokyo Metropolitan Dugout" is that it can be built with limited materials and labor. In addition, because its form is semi-underground, it can withstand a certain degree of machine gun strafing, as well as bomb fragments and small incendiary bombs. It is truly a good temporary residence under scorched earth tactics, and it is also an air-raid shelter for evacuation and can also be used as a storage place for storing materials, possessing various good conditions.</p>
<p>The standard specifications initially built by the Tokyo Township Association are similar to a raised floor, six tatami mats (one tatami mat is about 18 square feet) per room, with about one tsubo (six square feet) of earthen floor (mud floor inside the house). Following this example, four and a half, three, or six tatami mats can also be made.</p>
<p>As for the materials required, old materials taken from buildings demolished during forced evacuation can be used, or a portion of existing houses can be further dismantled. As for labor, the Tokyo Township Association's neighborhood association already has the manpower. However, the capital authorities are currently consulting with various labor relations departments.</p>
<p>Technical guidance is provided by the Emergency Construction Department of the Capital Defense Bureau, which has unveiled the sign of the "Tokyo Metropolitan Dugout Construction Consultation Center," and the construction section of each district's defense division is also responsible for consulting with the general public. An actual sample of the "Tokyo Metropolitan Dugout" has been completed in front of the public hall in Hibiya Park. Also, the cost required is roughly around 1,000 yen for a six-tatami mat.</p>
<p>**Glimpses of Advantages**</p>
<p>According to the chief of the General Affairs Section and the chief of the Construction Section of the Capital Defense Bureau, who created this "Tokyo Metropolitan Dugout," the details are as follows:</p>
<p>Question: What is the style?</p>
<p>Answer: If possible, a completely underground style should be adopted, but due to geological problems and hygiene problems such as lighting and ventilation, the semi-underground style is now being adopted. It is very effective in air defense, and there are no problems in terms of hygiene.</p>
<p>Question: What about areas with springs, such as downtown?</p>
<p>Answer: Dig down within the waterless range, and all the soil can be piled up around it.</p>
<p>Question: How is the transportation of materials done?</p>
<p>Answer: This is closely related to the construction site. It depends on the evacuation situation of the building. It can be built on open spaces where houses have already been demolished, and in locations that do not interfere with fire fighting activities, evacuation, and air-raid shelter construction. As for the problem of transporting secondary materials, it can be solved with horse-drawn carriages or trucks.</p>
<p>Question: Is it permissible to build dugouts on open spaces where houses have already been burned down?</p>
<p>Answer: In general, before the fundamental plan for reconstruction is drawn up, a policy of temporarily prohibiting it is adopted in principle, but after investigating the terrain and land conditions, if it is indeed suitable for building dugouts, we plan to designate appropriate locations and allow construction.</p>
<p>Question: How does it feel to live in a dugout?</p>
<p>Answer: It is not only safe but also very comfortable. Ventilation and lighting are certainly not as good as above-ground housing, but it is warm in winter and cool in summer. The temperature is also better than the air-raid shelters around a building. (Translated from the Yomiuri Hochi, March 21)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt's Death and the Relationship between Chongqing and the United States</h3>
<p>At this time of great urgency in the international political situation, U.S. President Roosevelt suddenly passed away. The people in Chongqing were probably the most shocked and dismayed by the news of Roosevelt's sudden death. This is because the so-called U.S.-Chiang cooperation was not based on trust in the United States in reality, but rather on expectations for Roosevelt personally. There is no need for us to point out the extremely cunning attitude of Britain towards China, and the authorities in Chongqing have already experienced it. As for the U.S.'s attitude towards China, it is somewhat different, and it is what Chongqing has been yearning for.</p>
<p>Many people in Chongqing often praised the progressiveness and idealism of the United States, and we can still hear this kind of admiration around us. However, the United States is essentially no different from Britain. Yet why do people in Chongqing have a different feeling towards the U.S. than they do towards Britain and approach the U.S.? Franklin Roosevelt has a great deal to do with this. Roosevelt, who has been the dictator of the United States for twelve years, has led Chongqing to the illusion that Roosevelt is the United States. Roosevelt was the instigator of the Greater East Asia War and the most virtuous and loyal believer in American imperialism. His disguise was an air of idealism, which allowed him to connect with Chongqing in a skillful manner that was almost genius.</p>
<p>To give an analogy, Roosevelt's existence is like the sugar coating on a pill of American imperialism that Chongqing is swallowing. Everyone likes to eat sugar, and after twelve long years, this layer of sugar coating is quite thick. Roosevelt personally took great care not to directly give this bitter medicine of American imperialism to Chongqing, and Chongqing was quite wary of this pill. The smart officials in Chongqing only hoped to taste the sugar coating of this dangerous pill appropriately. Chongqing knew early on that U.S.-Chiang cooperation had considerable dangers.</p>
<p>We can find several concrete examples. For example, the recall of Stilwell last autumn is one such example. This man, with the violent nature of an American Indian, had been strongly demanding that the Chongqing army under his command immediately mobilize for the war against Japan for the sake of the United States since he was ordered to go to Chongqing. To hand over the command tower, which was no different from the life of Chongqing, was something that Chiang could not tolerate. Therefore, the fierce friction between Stilwell and Chiang was ultimately unavoidable. Foreign journalists reported on this matter at the time. The solution to this problem was Roosevelt's recall of him to the United States on the grounds of "Stilwell's personal character."</p>
<p>Although Roosevelt was criticized by domestic public opinion for this matter, Chongqing was saved for the time being, and the friction between the U.S. and Chongqing was lubricated. The political significance of Roosevelt's existence can be seen from this.</p>
<p>The same thing can also be seen in the remarks made by Ambassador Hurley upon his return to the United States. The US public opinion and military are determined to unify the two armies of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and if things continue like this, the United States and Chongqing will inevitably fall into a frontal confrontation. It was still Roosevelt's skillful disguise that eased this strained situation. As the Pacific War progressed, the US Congress's ambition to permanently place island after island under the Stars and Stripes did not particularly stimulate Chongqing. One of the reasons for this is that the important figure feels at ease with the existence of idealist Roosevelt.</p>
<p>In the US Congress's concern for the Greater East Asia, Chongqing or China is not worthy of their consideration. All they have is aggression and territorial desire. There is nothing that can resonate with the new Chinese nationalism. Its naked true face is hidden behind the idealistic curtain of Roosevelt.</p>
<p>Now, this sugar coating, this curtain, has been removed forever. It is difficult to expect the new president, Truman, who succeeds him, to have the seasoned skills of Roosevelt, who has been the dictator of the United States for twelve years, to handle the international political situation, as well as the power to suppress Congress. As for the color of idealism, it is even more unnecessary to talk about it. Due to the lack of strength of the successor and the loss of idealism, the future steps of the Allied powers will of course be decisively affected. At the same time, the US's ability to act towards China will be like a war chariot controlled by a madman, disregarding the consequences and doing whatever it wants.</p>
<p>Whenever Chongqing encounters a difficult situation in its relationship with the United States, it can never find a solution. Chongqing has no other way but to come out and solve the problem. In the near future, Chongqing will experience the true face of the United States. (Translated from the Continental New Daily, April 15)</p>
<h3>How to Stabilize People's Livelihood</h3>
<p>— Zhou Bangjun</p>
<p>Since January of the 34th year, Shanghai factories have mostly suspended or reduced work due to power restrictions and difficulties in sourcing raw materials. Shops have goods but no buyers due to reduced social purchasing power. On the contrary, the prices of daily necessities have broken last year's records, soaring and hovering, with little hope of decline. As a result, people's livelihood is becoming increasingly difficult.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, the number of unemployed people in society has increased, and even those who are employed cannot enjoy their work. Because factories have stopped production, workers have no work, and daily expenses cannot be neglected. They are wandering and do not know where to go. Shops are deserted by customers, and the sales income is often insufficient to cover expenses. It is already difficult to maintain their own survival, and they cannot take care of the family life of unemployed workers. As a result, it is difficult to stabilize people's livelihood, and it is difficult to ensure social order.</p>
<p>Although the authorities are now engaged in evacuation as a radical solution, because the communication speed is accelerated, it is necessary to plan measures to stabilize the above-mentioned facts, so that a good and peaceful order can be maintained. The following are my humble opinions:</p>
<p>**Expand Small-Amount Loans**</p>
<p>Silver and money businesses originally had the responsibility of adjusting social finance. In the past, the targets of loans were mostly factories and shops. In this autumn of depression in all industries, in order to prevent floating capital from tending to speculation and manipulation, it seems appropriate to focus on small-amount loans so that a portion of the unemployed people can use the borrowed funds to seek survival opportunities.</p>
<p>**Promote Small Handicrafts**</p>
<p>Small handicrafts were originally our country's inherent industry. Since the introduction of machine-made industries, small handicrafts have gradually been eliminated. However, in order to adapt to the actual environment and provide relief for unemployment, it seems appropriate to pay attention to promoting and rewarding them. Those who are not familiar with production skills can set up institutions to be responsible for training.</p>
<p>**Use Waste to Make**</p>
<p>Wasting resources is not allowed even in peacetime. When the source of materials is scarce, waste materials should be used as much as possible to make usable objects so that the unemployed can engage in the collection of waste, sort it out, and use it according to its material.</p>
<p>In this way, even if the unemployed have no place to work, they still have the opportunity to get work, and the country cannot guarantee that there will be no shortage of food and clothing. The current difficulties may be solved as a result. As for those who are employed but cannot enjoy their work, the reason is nothing more than that the cost of living is too high and the income cannot offset the expenditure. But if they can engage in the commission of serious life and use their leisure time, they may be able to solve their current difficulties. Therefore, I declare:</p>
<p>**Cultivation of Serious Life**</p>
<p>A decadent view of life is a shortcut to ruin and disgrace. During this period, we should restrain ourselves and use reasonable income for reasonable expenses. Knowing that the threat to life is getting worse day by day, if we can endure hardship, we may be able to cope with any eventuality. If we "get drunk today with the wine we have today," we are abandoning our bright future. At this time, if we can be serious about our private lives, we can feel physically and mentally comfortable.</p>
<p>**Use of Leisure Time**</p>
<p>The more you use your thoughts, the more agile they become, and the more diligent you work, the more skilled you become. In the past, we were addicted to comfort, but in the future, we should try to correct it. Moreover, in order to seek the stability of our own lives, we should use our leisure time to engage in production work, part-time jobs, and side businesses, no matter how big or small the work is. Anything that can increase income can be done. If we are accustomed to idleness and extravagance, although we will gradually decline, we will also be socially responsible.</p>
<p>In short, economizing and increasing income were originally the key to establishing a family and a career. In this environment, we should follow it as a guide. If we do not distinguish between these, not only will those who are employed not be able to enjoy their work, but the result will also be unemployment.</p>
<p>Furthermore, stabilizing people's livelihood cannot be achieved by empty words, nor can it be effective by simply providing relief to the unemployed and the employed. There are many problems. Let me give three examples:</p>
<p>**Unblock the Source of Daily Necessities**</p>
<p>The straight-line increase in the prices of daily necessities is enough to shake the stability of people's livelihood. Food, oil, salt, and fuel are all daily necessities, and we must find ways to unblock the supply of resources and encourage procurement and transportation so that prices can be leveled and the people's burden can be reduced.</p>
<p>**Eliminate Speculation**</p>
<p>Speculation is similar to gambling, which is enough to encourage the bad habit of getting something for nothing and to stimulate the rise in general prices. Moreover, rumors are spread deliberately, and people are confused. Social peace and order cannot be maintained as a result. Therefore, without effective countermeasures, it is difficult to eliminate the root of the problem.</p>
<p>**Strict Suppression of Consumption Places**</p>
<p>Social figures are engaged in speculative transactions, and legitimate industrial and commercial enterprises are unable to receive support. Moreover, because it is easy to come by, they gradually become extravagant. Unnecessary children's places are born as a result, not only consuming resources but also cultivating the bad habit of relying on luck for security and seizing by trickery.</p>
<p>All of these are the main causes that make people's livelihood unstable. Therefore, stabilizing people's livelihood should be done through many efforts. Otherwise, it will be difficult to ensure social peace and order. Bangjun only briefly describes the temporary solution for the current situation. As for a permanent solution, it still needs to be discussed by experts.</p>
<h3>Talking about Air-Raid Shelters Again</h3>
<p>— Meng Weiyong</p>
<p>There are now air-raid shelters in this city that can be found every few steps, but most of them are just decorations that have been perfunctorily done. We can find the following problems anytime and anywhere:</p>
<p>*   Digging is too shallow, and some depths are less than two feet.</p>
<p>*   The height of the bamboo shed mostly exceeds the depth of the hole, so its risk of being hit by shrapnel is greater. Moreover, the bamboo shed is not firmly erected. The exterior is only plastered with wet soil, and the interior is all dry and loose soil, which is prone to cracks and collapses at any time.</p>
<p>*   Rainwater accumulates, and mosquitoes and flies breed, which is unhygienic.</p>
<p>*   Air defense work should be fast, but most of the holes are dug without building sheds, so they cannot cope with emergencies.</p>
<p>*   The construction is not solid; there is a risk of collapse even before the shrapnel arrives. Not only can it not protect life, but it will also be buried by the air-raid shelter.</p>
<p>*   Most air-raid shelters are built on sidewalks, which are very likely to be crushed by nearby houses during bombing, leading people to their deaths.</p>
<p>*   Air-raid shelters are not managed.</p>
<p>Therefore, I suggest the following points for the relevant authorities to refer to:</p>
<p>Judging from the above points, the biggest problem is the lack of a comprehensive plan and good guidance, resulting in perfunctory work. Therefore, the authorities should establish an air-raid shelter promotion committee to be responsible for guiding and supervising the public on how to dig, ordering each neighborhood head to report the location and digging situation of the air-raid shelter, and directly sending personnel to review the location to see if it is qualified, so as to avoid perfunctory fraud.</p>
<p>In order to avoid collapses and easy penetration by shrapnel, it is advisable to use brick and cement construction (such as the Laojiefu gate on Nanjing Road), digging the bottom as much as possible.</p>
<p>In order to avoid being affected by the collapse of nearby houses, you should choose an open space to dig. It is best to ask the authorities to build large-scale and solid air-raid shelters in open spaces or parks, such as the Racecourse and the Bund Park.</p>
<p>The cleanliness and order of the air-raid shelter can be assigned to nearby self-defense teams. A sign should be hung outside the door stating "Number of People Who Can Be Accommodated" to avoid unexpected accidents caused by temporary crowding.</p>
<p>Along the Jing'an Temple Road of the Racecourse, there is a small cement ditch (from the New World to Xinchang Road), about five feet wide and more than four feet deep. Some of it has been blocked by sweat and emits an foul odor, which is harmful to hygiene in hot weather. You may wish to remove the sewage and rebuild many air-raid shelters; not only are they solid, but they are also deeper than ordinary air-raid shelters, and there is no collapse of civilian houses around them, which is very suitable for building standards. If the authorities can use this ditch, it will not only benefit hygiene but also benefit air defense. It is a win-win situation.</p>
<h3>On Early Ending of School</h3>
<p>— Jiang Yu</p>
<p>It is heard that the school authorities, in view of the urgency of the situation, are preparing to end the semester's courses early; as for future measures, there are no specific regulations.</p>
<p>I believe that if we only end the semester's studies early to cope with the current situation, the method is not perfect, because this will inevitably disregard the studies of young students and will inevitably cover the lives of teachers and staff.</p>
<p>It is true that, from the perspective of the school itself, there will be many difficulties in continuing to operate in the future, such as bombing, such as the material conditions of high prices,... These are undeniable facts. But even if there are difficulties, the difficulties are not impossible to overcome and remedy. Shanghai is the center for schools after the war. There are countless young students who are cultivating talents for the society and the country. The schools should not be allowed to close down.</p>
<p>Secondly, the lives of the teachers and staff of the various schools are already at the end of their ropes. If the schools are to be generally closed in the future, cutting off their livelihoods, the difficulty of their situation can be imagined!</p>
<p>Just based on the above two points, I believe that the school authorities should take into account the following three aspects when dealing with the wood problem: (A) How to make the education industry suitable for the special situation of Shanghai in the future; (B) How to allow the majority of young students to continue their studies; (C) How to allow the professor to save the teacher to maintain his life. In order to take into account the above three points, I will describe my humble opinion for the school authorities to refer to and adopt:</p>
<p>After the early end of the spring semester, classes should be started immediately, adopting a three-semester system for one academic year, or opening summer schools. This point has already been created by several universities and middle schools. If unnecessary subjects and academic programs are suspended, the students' study time can be shortened, and it is in line with the wartime environment and needs.</p>
<p>In order to avoid indiscriminate bombing by enemy aircraft in the future, methods should be found to find another location immediately. Under this situation, we can take: dispersed classes, use the school sites of other schools, and merge several schools to form joint classes.</p>
<p>Open joint universities and joint middle schools in safe areas to disperse some schools and students; this point was discussed in detail by the Qingzhou director of the Rehe Teaching Department in the Shenbao Weekly Review; however, to date, there are no concrete measures to implement it, so I deeply hope that the authorities can actively support and assist it, and the school authorities should give up all private concerns and plans for the sake of the students' studies and discuss the relocation methods with each other.</p>
<p>The above points are only briefly discussed from the perspective of my humble opinion. Shallowness is inevitable, and there will be many difficulties in implementation. I hope that throwing bricks and attracting jade can cause discussion among enthusiastic education people so that the problem of the schools in Shanghai can be properly solved in the future.</p>
<h3>Improving Air Raid Shelters</h3>
<p>— Xu Yuhang</p>
<p>Air raid shelters are established to safeguard the safety of the people, but most of the air raid shelters in this city are far from ideal. For example:</p>
<p>Air raid shelters without roofs have the following situations:</p>
<p>When it rains, they are filled with rainwater, turning the air raid shelter into a reservoir. Now that the weather is getting hotter, mosquitoes breed, making it a breeding ground for disease.</p>
<p>Over time, garbage accumulates, which is unsanitary. It was reported that a dead child was found in an air raid shelter on South Yi Bei Road.</p>
<p>At night, the street lights are dim, and citizens may fall into the air raid shelters if they are not careful. It's fine when it's sunny, but it's a disaster when it rains!</p>
<p>Air raid shelters with roofs—that is, those with bamboo frames covered with earth on top of the pit—are often used as residences by beggars, or as places for people to smoke opium.</p>
<p>To prevent the above situations, I have the following suggestions for the authorities to consider:</p>
<p>Air raid shelters without roofs cannot prevent the falling of high-explosive shrapnel, so a roof must be added to ensure safety. The surrounding soil of the air raid shelter should be one or two inches higher than the ground to prevent rainwater from flowing in.</p>
<p>The air raid shelter should be guarded by the Self-Defense Corps to prevent children from playing inside; if a dead child is found, the on-duty corps member should be responsible. If beggars enter the air raid shelter, the on-duty corps member should drive them away.</p>
<p>A red light should be hung on top of the air raid shelter at night, so that citizens will not fall in when passing by.</p>
<h3>Freezing Gold</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>Recently, speculative funds have flocked to gold speculation, causing rapid changes in the market. Gold is not directly related to people's livelihood, but recently, commodity prices in this city have shown signs of rising. The municipal authorities have expressed their intention to thoroughly investigate gold speculation, but the only way to eliminate speculation is to temporarily freeze gold in this city:</p>
<p>First, silver and money businesses should immediately stop using gold as collateral for loans; they should report gold that has already been used as collateral to the authorities for freezing.</p>
<p>Second, temporarily prohibit the sale and purchase of gold bars and gold ornaments, or the use of gold as a means of purchasing goods, to prevent the current speculative funds in the form of gold from flowing to commodity speculation again. Violators will have their gold confiscated.</p>
<p>Third, prohibit the carrying of gold and gold products out of Shanghai.</p>
<p>If the above measures can be taken, it will not only stop the price of gold from rising again, but also freeze speculative funds, which is a fundamental way to eliminate speculation.</p>
<p>In extraordinary times, only extraordinary measures can be taken. It is hoped that the municipal authorities will study this.</p>

<p>Bai Mao</p>
<h3>Water</h3>
<p>— Hou Qianli</p>
<p>With a crack of lightning, the landlady announced: The water meter has reached its limit, and no water is allowed for the next six or seven days.</p>
<p>The building was immediately in an uproar. Some people even wanted to take a lead bucket to the tap to act when the opportunity arose, but the fat landlady personally guarded it, one person holding the pass, truly unmatched by ten thousand men.</p>
<p>The Ningbo woman in the small room was the first to complain, citing many pieces of evidence to prove that her family had not used too much water, and that she even used the same water for washing her feet that she used for other purposes. Therefore, reaching the limit was truly unjust, and the innocent were suffering.</p>
<p>This naturally caused some dissatisfaction, so Mr. Li, a teacher from the back building, stood up:</p>
<p>"Mrs. Sun, you can't say that. Water is for everyone to use. This time, everyone has to take some responsibility. For example, Mrs. Sun, doesn't she use a drop of water? Has she never used it? You can't say that."</p>
<p>"I use it, but we save it," Mrs. Sun said, "We even wash our feet..."</p>
<p>"What's the use of that? For example, if a student fails an exam, no matter how much he says he studied hard before, it won't be of any use, right? Now, basically..."</p>
<p>Mr. Li suddenly realized that this "for example" was not very appropriate for Mrs. Sun, so he stopped talking and changed his tone:</p>
<p>"The important thing now is that everyone doesn't have water. We have to think of a way to get water."</p>
<p>So everyone started discussing it again. The landlady was not coming to participate, first, because she had to guard the tap to prevent anyone from smuggling water. Second, honestly, she had already stored two tanks of water. For these few days, she wouldn't have to worry about not having water.</p>
<p>Someone suggested borrowing water from the neighbors. The first person was relatively successful, borrowing half a lead bucket of water to cook rice. The second time, the owner refused, the reason being:</p>
<p>"We're almost out ourselves."</p>
<p>So someone went to think of a way in the opposite alley, because there was a well over there, and well water was not limited. The person who went was Mrs. Li, the wife of the middle school teacher. The people in the opposite alley agreed, but there was also someone watching by the well, and each person was only allowed one lead bucket, and they had to line up, one by one.</p>
<p>Regardless, it was better than suffering without a drop of water.</p>
<p>"This is called drinking water and thinking of the source, always knowing that it is not easy to come by," Mr. Li said to his children during dinner. He was "forgetting no opportunity for education."</p>
<p>"Isn't that right? Even a bowl of soup takes a long walk to get," Mrs. Li, having experienced it herself, of course knew more details. "Having lived for thirty or forty years, this is the first time I've suffered like this."</p>
<p>The water for washing faces was of course saved. Everyone just wiped their faces on a towel and finished. Mr. Li found that this was also good, not only saving water, but also saving time. Not having water had its advantages after all, he thought.</p>
<p>But a bottle of boiled water was indispensable. Since hearing a lecture by a medical doctor, Mr. Li had never stopped drinking a large glass of boiled water after dinner every day for four or five years (he originally advocated drinking at least three large glasses a day). Even if it was not easy to come by, health was still important. It wasn't worth losing one's health for a bit of water. Besides, it hadn't reached the point of being completely without water.</p>
<p>As soon as he drank the boiled water, he noticed a strange taste in the water, like rotten mud, or like rotten vegetable roots. He asked his wife to smell it, and it was the same. He asked his children to smell it again, and it was the same.</p>
<p>This made Mr. Li very surprised. He went around asking, and the results were all the same. Someone asked:</p>
<p>"Mr. Li, you're a teacher, what's the reason for this?"</p>
<p>"It's the well water," Mr. Li finally understood: "If the well is opened and not used, it will be like this."</p>
<p>The children, being nervous, began to complain of stomachaches, so the parents were busy running up and down, asking if other people's children had the same feeling, asking if they had been poisoned, and what kind of quick-acting medicine to take, and panicking, as if something terrible had happened.</p>
<p>Mr. Li was a teacher after all, and he had the spirit of that elementary school teacher in "Under the Eaves of Shanghai." Look at him, this time he stopped a woman who was about to run out to call a doctor.</p>
<p>"It's okay, Mrs. Wang," he said, calmly taking a puff of his inferior cigarette: "I guarantee it's okay, I promise you'll be fine in a while! Don't worry, nothing will happen. Absolutely not."</p>
<p>"But this child keeps crying about a stomachache, almost rolling on the ground," the woman said dubiously.</p>
<p>"That's psychological. I understand," Mr. Li explained: "There's probably no poison in the well water."</p>
<p>After persuading the woman to go back, Mr. Li returned to his room.</p>
<p>"What to do? There's no water again today, should we go to that well to get it?" his wife greeted him.</p>
<p>"Don't go, think of a way somewhere else," he said. Even though he said it was okay, the taste was really bad.</p>
<p>"Where else is there?" his wife asked back, taking a breath; "Sigh! These days, even water is becoming a resource. It's a joke, I've never heard of it before. Where did this start?"</p>
<p>This really aroused a lot of emotion in Mr. Li. People living in the world should have as much water as they need, which was originally a gift from God to everyone, and should not have any restrictions...</p>
<p>But who could he tell these theories to? What was happening was a fact, they had no water to use, no water to drink, and couldn't even get a drop of water.</p>
<p>The more they didn't have water, the more things they needed water for. For example, a guest came to see Mr. Li and talked for three hours without being offered a cup of tea. Mr. Li had to honestly tell his colleague that his family was out of water:</p>
<p>"Regarding water," he said, "we have become like longing for rain in a great drought."</p>
<p>So the two of them laughed loudly, shaking the dust off the ceiling.</p>
<p>This was a small matter. Today there was no water to cook rice. Without water, raw rice cannot be cooked into cooked rice. Of course, no one wanted to go to the well in the opposite alley again. Moreover, honestly, even if someone wasn't afraid of the taste and still planned to get a lead bucket, they wouldn't be allowed to anymore. The person watching the alley had already warned:</p>
<p>"Please be considerate. We each contributed five hundred yuan for this well. We haven't even had enough ourselves, and we're already treating guests! Where in the world are there such good people?"</p>
<p>Mr. Li suddenly remembered seeing people waiting for water at the red taps on the road every day. He thought he might as well try. It didn't require any capital or effort.</p>
<p>"Tell A-Guan to go to the tap on the road to get some water," he said to his wife, as if discovering a new continent: "Hurry up, don't let others know, it'll be troublesome if there are too many people."</p>
<p>"Can you use the water from the road?" his wife seemed afraid to act rashly: "What if the police see it?"</p>
<p>"It's usable. Every day I see a lot of people surrounding the tap, lead buckets, basins, everything. If they can use it, why can't we?" Mr. Li said righteously.</p>
<p>So twelve-year-old A-Guan was sent out with a lead bucket.</p>
<p>The landlady's voice rang out from downstairs.</p>
<p>"Who's shameless? Who's shameless? If you have the ability, come down, dare to come down and try turning it on!"</p>
<p>Then the Ningbo woman in the small room also refused to be outdone, raising her voice as much as possible:</p>
<p>"You dirty thing! Shameless, you hoarded two tanks of water yourself, but you won't let others use a drop!"</p>
<p>Mr. Li stepped out. He felt responsible for mediating the quarrel between the wives.</p>
<p>"Mr. Li, you're knowledgeable, give a fair judgment!" The landlady seemed to have support, and her voice was even louder: "I didn't turn off the tap for no reason, everyone refused to conserve, what can I do if the meter reached its limit? But they say I'm shameless, where am I shameless? People from Ningbo are the most unreasonable, I've never seen..."</p>
<p>"You hoarded two tanks..." the Ningbo woman repeated the reason.</p>
<p>"Okay, why bother?" Mr. Li said with a long face and a smile: "Why bother? Everyone is helpless, what's the point of arguing? If there's no water, everyone's the same..."</p>
<p>"That's right! I don't know who's shameless, blah blah blah..." the landlady flashed two gold teeth.</p>
<p>"Alright, leave it," Mr. Li quietly advised: "Landlady, say a few less words, really, what's the point of arguing? But, when will the water come back? It's really inconvenient without water."</p>
<p>"These days, I can't hide it from you, Mr. Li, being a landlord is really a thankless job, other people see..."</p>
<p>Regardless of how other people saw it, a child from next door ran in like a race.</p>
<p>"Mrs. Wu, there's a child here who was beaten on the road..."</p>
<p>"Where?" Mr. Li's whole body trembled.</p>
<p>"Next to the tap, people wouldn't let him wait for water, he was beaten and bled..."</p>
<p>Before he could finish speaking, Mr. Li had already pushed open the door and strode out.</p>
<h3>Freedom—Reply to Liu Lin</h3>
<p>— Yi Fan</p>
<p>Reading your "Brief Letter", I felt a warm comfort, but also a little unease at being misunderstood. I am extremely willing to accept well-intentioned criticism from friends, sometimes even harshness—as long as it is sincere; however, I also hope that my friends can calm down a bit and listen to my confession, which is not a naked self-justification. In this way, we can have a deeper friendship and a deeper understanding.</p>
<p>Living in the exploited class of society, and personally experiencing all kinds of embarrassment and injustice, I am constantly depressed, indignant, and sometimes feel a bit of sadness and loneliness; but I have no intention of taking a little warmth from my memory, because there is no warmth to speak of in my memory. The re-chewing of the past in "Reunion", if there is anything relatively sweet, is only a bit of occasional vicissitudes, perhaps this is also a waste of people's emotions. I say that your studies are better than mine, you can have the enthusiasm to pursue ideals, which is commendable. So I hope you can hold on to school life; but it is not to isolate you from society, and every day with a cavity of enthusiasm in the void "pursue" the ideal, my meaning is just that you should take advantage of the time before entering society, while you still have a free body, to use knowledge and physical strength to fill your enthusiasm. And because your situation is not much better than mine, you may lose your schooling at any time, so I feel more and more that it is not easy for you to study now, and I shout it out for you. But from this, you think that as soon as I enter society, I lose the enthusiasm to pursue ideals, but this is not the case. Society gives me coldness, gives me tyranny, I admit that I have been extinguished some enthusiasm by those vampires, but from this I also got a valuable lesson, that is: a firm belief is better than a hollow enthusiasm. And fragile emotions sometimes confuse my direction in life. I began to understand the need for calm, I want to use a calm attitude to identify, to resist, to attack, ... However, my friend! I have to feel here that my words are too "enthusiastic", in fact, if I don't "jump out of the shackles of life by myself, and return to me a free life," it is very difficult for me to have the possibility of attacking. You don't understand "life" here, but you should understand. Of course, it refers to the family's burden that cannot be escaped. For the sake of the family's lowest life, I can only swallow my anger, and exchange a large amount of energy for meager rewards, I can not use justice and reason to push against those who exploit me. These words, only those who are in the same situation as me can feel the certainty, the heaviness. As for some friends, they may accuse me of not having courage, tending to be passive, but haven't I been indignant? Just if I "willfully", I will see the hungry faces of my loved ones! Think about it, if I never jump out by myself, how can I do the work I want to do? To achieve my hopes? (And people don't want to have self-consoling dreams.) So I said the following few sentences. Can you understand my difficulties? Thank you for your encouragement, yes, I am facing the hardships of life, and I will take resisting these hardships as comfort. I have long abandoned those illusory comforts, no, it can also be said that I never wanted any illusory comforts. But precisely because I want to face the various hardships in this vast world, and gather the strength of my partners to fight, I thought about jumping out of the shackles of life by myself. Otherwise, as you said, I only see my own life and family, why can't I be like those who "climb up", to concentrate on scheming and flattering? In this way, soon, wouldn't I be able to make my own and my family's life a little more prosperous? But my friend, is this what I want?</p>
<p>You say that C in "Reunion" and I merge together, is exactly a portrayal of myself, exaggerating the contradictions in my thinking. This has to surprise me that you still haven't understood me. In fact, how can I hate cities and love remote villages? Both cities and villages are societies composed of humans, and at present, both have more dark sides and fewer bright sides. What I hate is the bad system, the cannibalistic kind, they are both in the city and in the countryside; at the same time, I love beautiful illusions, of course, my ideal is definitely not the so-called partial "construction of the countryside".</p>
<p>Some words, perhaps are exactly what some of the exploited want to say; and if it is worth it for people other than you to see, then this publication is not without meaning.</p>
<h3>Gleanings</h3>
<p>— Chen Shi</p>
<p>Old Liu held a roll of banknotes and sighed, "A thousand dollars is really a burden to me!"</p>
<p>I asked in surprise: "Only people suffer from money, how can money cause people suffering?"</p>
<p>"You don't understand the reason, listen to me explain." He sat up straight and said:</p>
<p>"On the second day of the Lunar New Year, Lao Xu and I were having dinner at a colleague's house. There were many guests, and the mahjong table was about to get lively. After dinner, some of the guests left, and the host invited Lao Xu and me to make up the game and reorganize the mahjong table. In less than two rounds, Lao Xu had lost several thousand.</p>
<p>Of all the unfortunate things in the world, this should be one - of course, more unfortunate things are yet to come - you know, Lao Xu can really be called thrifty. I've been with him for some years, and I've never seen him spend an extra penny.</p>
<p>'Lao Liu! Tell me, is there anything more precious than money?' He often says: 'When I was young, I had a lot of fire. I used to talk about fame, morality, learning, and cultivation all day long. As soon as I talked about money, my face would turn red. But, after being in society for a long time, learning and morality don't matter at all, the only thing people worship is money!'</p>
<p>Lao Xu is frugal, but he likes to gamble. When he goes to a colleague's house, he's busy lifting tables and setting up tables. The money he saves so carefully slips away when he shuffles it on the table. We often laugh at him: 'A duck doesn't pee, but there's always a way to spend it.'</p>
<p>Think about it, how sad he must have been to lose so much money! He had to count the money several times before a hand was even won.</p>
<p>'Four thousand five hundred and ten yuan!' He scratched his head and muttered: 'No! Four thousand five hundred and fifty.'</p>
<p>'Hey! Do you want a five of Wan?' The player on his right impatiently reminded him with his elbow: 'Wait a while, don't say I didn't tell you on purpose.'</p>
<p>After finishing the mahjong, we sat on the sofa and chatted.</p>
<p>'I lost six thousand in total,' Lao Xu said, his face flushed red, looking very agitated. He couldn't concentrate on talking.</p>
<p>At this time, a colleague suddenly called out: 'Whose is this two thousand yuan?' He casually found two thousand yuan from the drawer of the table.</p>
<p>As soon as that colleague shouted, Lao Xu jumped up.</p>
<p>'This two thousand yuan is mine!' he said.</p>
<p>Without any fuss, the two thousand yuan went from that colleague's hand to Lao Xu's pocket.</p>
<p>'That's right, absolutely right—' Lao Xu thought for a moment, then announced to the crowd:</p>
<p>'Just now I forgot to count the money in my pocket. I brought twenty thousand in total, ten thousand on the table, and ten thousand in my pocket. Later, I only collected two thousand. I only thought I already had fourteen thousand in my pocket. Now that I've counted, if these two thousand yuan aren't found, there's only twelve thousand left.'</p>
<p>We don't know how much money he brought in his pocket. We can't deny the truth of these words.</p>
<p>Soon, everyone forgot about this little thing. The conversation continued, but Lao Xu was absent-minded, occasionally echoing a word or two, or forcing a few laughs.</p>
<p>One day, Lao Xu came to see me, and as we were talking, he suddenly interrupted and walked to the table, saying, 'Lao Liu, do you remember? At first I was sitting in this seat (he pointed to the seat opposite the one where the banknotes were found), and you were sitting opposite me. After 'Banning', I switched with you. Later, I sat down in the seat on the left, and I left these two thousand yuan here. When you were sitting here, did you open the drawer to look?'</p>
<p>'I didn't,' I said: 'The money is yours, there's no mistake!'</p>
<p>But I couldn't prove it, and Lao Xu seemed unhappy and sat down silently.</p>
<p>The next day, early in the morning, Lao Xu suddenly appeared in my bedroom. We talked casually, and he brought up the two thousand yuan again.</p>
<p>'Those two thousand yuan were supposed to be what I lost!' he stuttered. Then he repeated it again: he forgot that there were twenty-two thousand on the table; he moved from here to the opposite side, and then from there to the left side... and so on.</p>
<p>'You're overthinking it, who said the money isn't yours!' I said: 'You wouldn't take these few thousand dollars to heart.'</p>
<p>'What do you mean by that?' Suddenly, he asked coldly. "What do you mean by that?"</p>
<p>He stood up and said, trembling: 'You're simply a bastard... you despise my personality.' Shame and disgust made him unnatural.</p>
<p>'You say:' The money is yours.' But you don't mean it at all.' He said: 'You're saying in your heart: "Look at him, this guy is definitely feeling guilty." You despise my personality.'</p>
<p>'What do you want me to say?'</p>
<p>'Ask yourself! You're laughing in your heart: "This money is obviously that woman's" You deliberately hid it from me, you think I don't know. You deliberately watched me shamelessly repeat the words of taking other people's money in front of you, you deliberately played with me! Is this still a friend? Your heart is so vicious!'</p>
<p>'I have no way to lay my heart bare for you to see,' I said: 'But, from the bottom of my heart, I don't know anything about that. You bring up a woman for no reason... .'</p>
<p>'Don't you know?' he said: 'The next day, a female guest suddenly announced that the two thousand yuan was hers. She said she had played mahjong, and in her haste, she forgot the money in the drawer. She only realized it the next morning. That is to say, the money was in that drawer before we played cards, and I didn't leave it there. Isn't this obviously a joke? Losing two thousand yuan and only realizing it the next day. But, people actually believed her. They despise my personality, thinking that I have no money, and I lost so much...'</p>
<p>'I haven't heard them say that!'</p>
<p>'Now please give this two thousand yuan to the host,' he said: 'Lao Xu doesn't care. You tell him that the money is clearly Lao Xu's, and now he can just give it to that lowly bitch!' He didn't say anything more and left.</p>
<p>I brought the money to that colleague's house, but the host refused to accept it. He thought it was a very unfortunate thing. Lao Xu would certainly not falsely claim it, and the female guest wouldn't lie either. It must have been a misunderstanding, or perhaps a coincidence. He had already given the female guest two thousand yuan out of his own pocket. And he asked me to return the two thousand yuan to Lao Xu, saying that the female guest was mistaken and had not lost it.</p>
<p>Old Liu sighed and ended the story: "But, Lao Xu refuses to take it back. Tell me, what should I do?"</p>

<h3>Life</h3>
<p>— Yu Ruowen</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>In the preface to his "Comedy of Life," Mr. Ding Di wrote, "...I realize that the society I live in is a society centered on commerce, a deformed society centered on commerce! Businessmen are, of course, businessmen, but everyone is a businessman. In today's world, there is no culture, no religion, no morality, no education, and no spiritual life worth cherishing or longing for. Everything is just business: a commercialized world, commercialized humanity!"</p>
<p>Yes! Mr. Ding Di's words are incisive and thorough.</p>
<p>Everything is business! Commercialized life, commercialized conversation, commercialized human relationships, even the maintenance of affection between family members requires the help of commerce.</p>
<p>Young people living in such a world all hate it! Hate!</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>Is life a play? Yes, life is indeed a play!</p>
<p>I am used to seeing all of life from a distance, like a roc overlooking the world below. I only feel that humanity is foolish and stupid!</p>
<p>However, I am ultimately not a roc. After I realized people's foolishness and stupidity, I was immediately forced to descend and be foolish and stupid with them!</p>
<p>What I have is also a foolish and stupid life! I am silent.</p>

<h3>Bai Ma Cup Grand Football Match Expected Next Week</h3>
<p>Since the International Cup finals have become dominated by overseas Chinese teams, football matches have lost their appeal. Unexpectedly, amidst this silence, it is learned that the San You Sports Association is preparing to invite overseas Chinese football teams for a match. In addition, Fu Hua Tobacco Company has decided to hold a "Bai Ma Cup" football match, which has been approved by the Football Association and is scheduled to take place next week (likely on Sunday). The invited teams are Bai Ma against Qiao Lian.</p>
<p>Cheng Bo'an, General Manager of An Hua Tobacco Company, has been a strong advocate for football, sparing no effort. Last summer, he organized the Fu Hua Cup mini-league, which was very popular for a time. This time, he has spared no expense and effort to organize a grand football match. Negotiations with various parties have taken a lot of effort, but everything is now ready. All that remains is for the Football Association to set the date, and a most exciting football match will be presented to the fans.</p>
<p>Bai Ma Recruits Players from Dong Hua and Lian Yi</p>
<p>It has been noted that Bai Ma team players registered with the Football Association cannot be allowed to participate in the match, but their players are from the Dong Hua and Lian Yi members teams. Therefore, Bai Ma officials have issued official letters to the two teams to borrow players. The authorities of the two teams then approved the letters of loan to members and presented them to the Football Association, which was approved by the Football Association. The players are all the soldiers of the Dong Hua A Group. Those borrowed from Lian Yi are Zhu Lingsheng, Li Yichen, and Luo Shoufu. The strength is strong, and the list of players can be imagined.</p>
<p>Two Lineups Proposed for Bai Ma: With Bai Ma collecting famous players, it is possible to capture Qiao Lian. Regardless of who wins or loses, the performance will be excellent. Before this great battle, this magazine offers two lineups for reference by the authorities, choose one to use, and can hope for success. One: Zhang Banglun, Zhang Li, Lin Yigen, Chen Liang, Tang Fu, Song Lingsheng, Li Sun, Shun Dai, Jing Han, Hai Jia, Youliang</p>
<p>Using Zhang and Li as full-backs, their bold and unrestrained style is enough to threaten Qiao Lian's intrusion, and the logic is sufficient. However, the fear is that Zhang and Li have both made over-aggressive fouls in the penalty area when they served as inside-backs. If these two special attention to this point, a pair of iron gates, can almost a new eye for fans. On the center-back line, since Lin Genzhi is shifted later, Zhu Lingsheng is the only one who can do it, such scheduling, is not not always. The forehands have Han Longhai rushed back to help, naturally use the original, remember the most frustrating Dong Hua with Qiao Lian several wars, the offensive opportunity, unfortunately, a lack of such as Longhai can be the inside forward, was defeated, the audience can not help but remember this self-robe young man. Then, General Han arrived, Jia Youliang back in the original position, the five recorded the liaison work magical transmission, tacit cooperation, fruit for the general fans familiar with, I do not need to tell you. Another lineup can be: Zhang Banglun, Li Yichen, Zhuang Youren, Zhu Lingsheng, Jing Fuzhen, Zhang Lin, Gen Li, Yao Sun, Jinshun, Mai Youliang.</p>
<p>The first reason for this lineup is that Zhuang Youren's recent performance has improved greatly and his strength is also sufficient, so he should be reused, and he and Lin Gen can echo each other and take care of each other, without revealing flaws. The second reason is that if the first lineup is used, the left forward Liang Shutang and the left full-back Li Yichen are both from two teams, which is inevitable and unfamiliar. Moreover, Qiao Lian forwards are fierce right forwards and right wingers, so Zhu Lingsheng is replaced by Liang Shutang, since Zhu and Li are both from Lian Yi, they must know each other's playing styles, and Zhu's activity and strength are also better than Liang's. To defend against the opponent's right-hand side, reduce its offensive, should be a reasonable strategy, to the forward line, it has been said above that there is no need to change.</p>
<p>Looking at the above two lineups, it can be called the most standard candidates in the Hua team. That is more than the Chinese team in this International Cup. Fu Hua authorities, have this perseverance, so that the football season is about to pass has this most fascinating grand competition, commotion the fans, is worthy of praise.</p>
<p>Various Ceremonies Have Been Drawn Up: In order to make the ceremony more grand, the ceremony has also been considered, and it was decided to ask Wu Yunqi to hold the opening ceremony, and Liu Qiong was appointed to give the awards. Other prizes such as expensive, and used as the highest quality of leather and the ball, all for several years of the best goods on the glue, can be called the recent game in rare.</p>
<p>Yesterday's General Practice of the Whole Bai Ma Team: In order to cope with this great battle, all the members of Bai Ma especially made Dong Jianhua, and did the general practice at the Dong Hua Stadium yesterday. The whole team was full of spirit, lazy bull Li Yichen also Di Yun Fuzhai before the semi-finals with solid representatives of the Chinese team international cup replica, set from Chongming to Shanghai, the ball shoes are separated for a long time without supervision, causing fans to disappoint. This time, Bai Ma was invited again, and after several practice, naturally can have a more satisfactory result, the author saw its foot is crisp, indeed is a superior, this time is appointed after the surgery, I mean Villa must be no way to live, and fled. And Longhai also arrived yesterday, the wind what Pupu, Cang Black more, but watching the speed of the high, the heroic style without any reduction, will make Qiao Lian goalkeeper McNitt see and give birth to timid. His fierce rush the camera, not to show how much fans. (Bixian)</p>
<h3>An Overview of the Top Five Football Teams</h3>
<p>— Sisi</p>
<p>This season's football league has come to an end, and the general trend has been set. Only the replay between Portuguese Merchants and Lianyi is more controversial. Looking at the operations of the season, at this end, it may be useful to give a brief discussion on the top five teams, regardless of front and back, writing by hand.</p>
<p>Dong Hua</p>
<p>The prestige of the previous session, unparalleled. The football world was shocked and unanimously praised. At the beginning of this session, we were very careful and had unlimited expectations, and we also believed that it could continue to work hard. I hope that the team will fail to practice due to various reasons, which led to a big defeat when meeting Portuguese merchants. As a result, the morale was sharply reduced, and the failure to Qiu Wendu was a big surprise. Until the most disappointing battle, the battle with Qiao Lian, he tried his best to recover his reputation, and the result was still unsuccessful. But its soil gas, is indeed more prosperous than the beginning of the season. Overall, the various aspects of the team will not be much degraded due to the interval of a season, so the failure is entirely in the air. Li Ningliang Shutang Dai Linjingsun The previous session often practiced more and had the appearance of rejuvenation. On the contrary, this session due to lack of practice, and the father has more powerless old state, this is really the only regret of the wood session, but Yu on the team's spiritual aspects, that is satisfactory, it can attract a large number of viewers, that is the beacon.</p>
<p>Lian Yi</p>
<p>At the beginning of joining this league, there are generals such as Luo Shoujia, and the generals joined in unison. Lian Yi, who has always been a desolate general, has such candidates, so it is also visible. Indeed, at the beginning of the division, the whole force was awe-inspiring, and it had the feeling that I was the only one in the world this year. Unexpectedly, in the middle, both He Degao and Shanghai police tied. As a result, a courage, suffered a setback. The battle for the Portuguese merchants, made an unhappy ending. Now although there is a chance to replay, but Ru Qu Shui Fu Wu Qixiang's being deleted, the loss of the large, scheduling fruit still has a square, relatively speaking, it is inevitable that the relatively inferior. Therefore, the day of the replay, it seems that I dare not expect to have much harvest, I am afraid it will also become a person of covering the meaning of intention. But if Yu Lianyi soldiers' ball skills, such as can have its concentration camp spirit this season indomitable, the future is bright this brilliant, I hope the team can do so.</p>
<p>Portuguese Merchants</p>
<p>The team will have the absolute hope of winning the championship of this league. The reason why it can get this good fruit, first of all, is to get the help of Fu En W Pantuo Xun Ke Laituo, and Bao Xituo's debut, so the morale increased greatly. The reason why the Portuguese merchants have been paying attention to the league does not pay attention to the league, this sudden change is also a mystery. The team has indeed had several successful performances in this session, Bao Xituo's temptation to turn the ball, Fu En's speed, and Aolie Wiera's awe-inspiring, are all praised by fans. After that, the team also has a game against Lianyi's Bu Sa, which is expected to be solved easily and complete the results.</p>
<p>Qiao Lian</p>
<p>It is inevitable to have some regrets for not winning the chief seat with Qiao Lian's first place in the seat. The most significant thing is that the battle with the German merchants, due to misunderstanding of the failure to attend, was sentenced to abandon the right, the loss of a game, otherwise only lost to Lianyi a record of the game, there is a great possibility to climb the throne, at least with the Portuguese merchants to stand on an equal footing. But also the same team has won the championship of the Mayor's Cup, the Italian team represented by the team Tsing Yi, also won the International Cup finals, although the loss of a league championship, such as the ability to win the two titles, when can comfort, not to bear its heart. The recent situation of Jia, International Cup overwhelmed the Nordic, is extremely certain, if not lost in the league, then the package of three championships, Lei has the last Xiongfeng on behalf of Donghua.</p>
<p>Shanghai Police</p>
<p>In terms of the candidates for the Shanghai police, it should be listed as one of the strong teams, but the initial results of the league were greatly disappointed. The reason for the failure is that there is no novelty of tactics, no cover mode, with the later, the end of tacit understanding, in order to have one or two new will personally improve the leadership and self. More only battle, into the Guhou in several cities, can suddenly be able to win the absolute right, although barely self-consolation? But also enough to comfort himself? It is reported that the team due to the majority of players, left Shanghai after the Mayor's Cup finals, the football team also disintegrate it, it is inevitable to make people feel narrative scattered, "Shanghai police" two words are also on the verge of becoming a team in football history</p>
<h3>The Last Scene of the Basketball Charity Match: The Key to Hua Lian's Defeat</h3>
<p>The first and second battles of the basketball charity match hosted by Hua Lian Pharmaceutical Factory have been described in the previous issue. The last scene was played last Saturday at the Qingnianhui Gym in the Xianqiao Bridge. Hua Lian faced the Giants team. I gave Hua Lian unlimited expectations, but the result of the "war, Hua Lian was still defeated. The reporter carefully observed the battle, and the reasons for the failure should be:</p>
<p>Zhenzhong Absence</p>
<p>Hua Lian strengthened its strength, and special borrowing from the Shantou team and Zhongbei, but the second war, Huo Zhong did not arrive, so the author had made a sincere statement hoping that Zhenzhong would attend in the last issue. It is said that Zhenzhong does have the ability to command and transport the whole team, but I do not know why, in the last war, Zhenzhong still did not see the car, which in the rest of the team's morale aspects, not without shadow. And because the team members came from several teams, it is true that a central figure like Zhenzhong is missing.</p>
<p>Improper Deployment</p>
<p>Hua Lian's application of Chen Xuechong, Zhang Yiliang Xiong, Xu Jusheng, Zhuo Guorong Ma Canxi five people to fight, is very desirable, halfway through the sudden to Bao Songyuan Zhang Jinxuan transferred, is not appropriate. It is said that the situation of each warring is in the normal, how to casually deploy people, and the team members are not the same team, add more transfers, definitely not the best policy.</p>
<p>Lack of Breaking the Enemy The performance of the giants this time is not ideal, roughly also for the reason of long-term lack of practice. Regardless of its offensive and defensive stagnation in the too formulaic type, especially in the offensive when the fixed position, for the sake of unnecessary consumption of transmission, to induce the enemy, resulting in gaps and into the Hua Lian such as the reason, should be forced, not without success, Nai not this picture also! The giants guard the time of stay, is even more than the attack, then Hua Lian, such as the rapid and agile transmission, the basket from more. To sum up, the reason why Hua Lian is so, or to the loss of cooperation aspects.</p>
<p>In summary, with the Hua Lian out of the field candidates to talk about, should be able to win the giants, and finally defeated, no more to say. The Shanghai indoor competition, after that, due to the relationship between the field, can not see again, will be this battle as the last of a curtain, and Hua Lian's failure to defeat the giants, can not without regret.</p>
<p>Finally, for the Hua Lian Pharmaceutical Factory, the host Zhang Yuxiang's enthusiasm for running, the players' arrival and the fans' enthusiastic weaving, should be thanked on behalf of the Nanshi International Relief Hospital and Limin Hospital, and the blessing of the indirect patients. The football world has this charity move, is a good deed (Sound)</p>
<h3>Talking About Badminton (II)</h3>
<p>— Kang</p>
<p>In short, if a person can shed a lot of yellow sweat every day, then the body temperature must be kept on the balance line, and there will never be too high or too low body temperature. Because the substances in the sweat have been excreted, it will not harm the blood cells, diabetes. Jaundice is that the sweat contains impurities, and does not pay attention to the Ming set of transport to the skin respiratory organs, and red sweat, is that the sweat contains blood quality.</p>
<p>Using drugs to stimulate the sweat nerves, is not as good as moving the body, ask to use the sweat nerves and sweat well, you must know that the stimulation of drugs, is forced to use, does not fit the natural laws. The stimulation of drug sweat nerves, although it is beneficial to sweating, may not be harmless to other functions. But exercise and sweating, is beneficial and harmless.</p>
<p>Obese people, not only the body is not lively, not beautiful. And to the summer season, than not obese people, particularly can not stand the heat of the climate. Probably too much fat in the body, the body temperature is hotter, so Xu Fei people, more in the summer feel very uncomfortable, however, try to mold the skin of obese people, indeed it is very cool. This is because fatty acids can not fully emit outward.</p>
<p>If an obese person can often exercise this kind of ball game; then when playing the ball, to quickly hit the ball, hurry to run, the whole mind of attention. Psychological, physiological, while playing a great role. So a lot of sweating, the body of fatty acids, as much as possible to evaporate out, you can gradually reduce the excess fat, so that the body will not be very obese, and become a very suitable body. And the long-term movement, the muscles of all parts of the body, gradually solid, fat to, and muscle beauty, can become a beautiful body. Obese young men and women, there is great benefit, try it, when you know the benefits are not shallow.</p>
<p>Promote the Amount of Respiratory Volume</p>
<p>No matter who, once a fierce exercise, the cells of each part, immediately play a burning role, then the amount of lung respiration will certainly greatly increase. Since the amount of respiration has increased, then the unclean air in the lungs, and fresh air will be rapidly interchanged. The blood naturally clean, and the lung trachea, due to the vibration is very urgent, it will shrink very fast, so the lung cells will also be strong. The muscles of the chest, due to the amount of lung respiration, gradually developed. Chest muscles gradually beautiful, lung strong, lung disease where will occur? So this movement, for women, there is a special benefit. Moreover, most of the women in our country have underdeveloped chest and insufficient lung capacity, and they are prone to lung disease, but this kind of exercise does have extraordinary benefits. Because we often have to connect the high ball, the body will have to look up to the sky after the party, the chest is therefore expanded, is very beneficial. More than playing volleyball much better. Only people who have the second stage of lung disease, you can not exercise, you must wait until the disease is better, before you can play this ball game.</p>
<p>Exercise the Muscles of the Whole Body</p>
<p>This game, in addition to special development of the chest, can also develop the muscles of the whole body. Running, jumping, beneficial in the lower limbs. Left and right side strikes are beneficial to the waist. Saving dangerous balls, or net front balls, etc., are beneficial to the abdomen. As for the upper limbs, and the lower limbs, there is more direct bravery, so the pity, is only one arm holds the fear, the other arm can not be evenly developed ear.</p>
<p>This game, the ball comes quickly, to shoot the ball, very good, that is the whole experience, as well as the eyes of the measuring power. But to the eyes sharp, also the whole practice of using the eyes, more practice the line of sight. Because the hand can not be right, if the hand can not be in line with the heart, or the brain nerve sympathetic sluggish, you can not play the ball well. I often see many beginners, eyes and hands, do not correspond to the use, this is to practice muscles and tendons, less practice movement and the brain.</p>
<h3>A Description of Basketball Theory (XVI)</h3>
<p>— Liang Zhaoan</p>
<p>IV. Modern Defensive Methods</p>
<p>Modern defensive methods include so-called "man-to-man," five-person zone defense, and "man-to-man" and zone defense mixed defense, etc., but the former two are the most popular. The following is a summary of the two:</p>
<p>(A) "Man-to-Man" Defensive Method</p>
<p>The meaning of the "man-to-man" defensive method is that one member of our team guards one member of the opposing team. The use of it can vary according to the size of the court, the actual strength of the two players, the length of time in the game, and the opponent's offensive method. In general, the most common types are as follows: The members of our team guard the opposing members with equal physical strength. The forward guards the opponent's defender, the center guards the opponent's center, and the defender guards the opponent's forward. After our team loses the ball, the five members quickly retreat to the back court, waiting for the enemy to attack. When they cross the center line, each person identifies and guards one person nearby. While the four people each guard the person nearby, one person is responsible for strictly guarding the enemy rushing into the basket. The former two are suitable for smaller venues, the enemy is weak and we are strong, or equal strength, both are famous teams and can not cooperate with each other, or the enemy uses a delay tactics to win the score. The latter is for the sake of saving energy and is suitable for larger venues, the enemy is strong and we are weak, and the game time is far from over.</p>
<p>The "man-to-man" defensive method has its strengths and weaknesses. It must be used well to be effective. The advantage is that it can be matched with the opponent's size and ability to defend it, so that each person can designate one person to be responsible for the defense, can pressure the opponent at any time, rush to attack, destroy its formation, so that it has no room to breathe, and in the game at any time and anywhere can strictly prevent the enemy's actions. However, there are many shortcomings, if the distribution is improper, the members of our team against the opposing players, the individual strength disparity, it is easy to become a loophole, the whole team is in danger. Moreover, this defensive method is easily broken by the opposing team's blocking method. Because the guards using this method, must run with the enemy full court, he steps I step, he easy I touch approaching, the body already tired and easily touch the opponent's body foul.</p>
<p>Therefore, in addition to the whole team's cooperative defense, personal defensive skills must also be used well to adopt the "man-to-man" defensive method. Those who use this method of defense, 着 looking at people do not look at the ball, strictly monitor the enemy that I can guard; my standing position, should always be kept between the opponent and the enemy basket, often occupy the inner circle, pressure the enemy near the sideline, so that the enemy can not run to the valley, and can not let the enemy run to the back, and give it a chance to sneak attack. The distance between the position and the opponent, depends on the skill of the opponent's height. The enemy is more sensitive than I am, should be away from it more, the enemy is more dull than I am, then it should be slightly closer, and can quickly move forward, pretending to be, so that its panic and confusion, take the opportunity to capture the ball. If the opponent does not have the ball in hand, he can let him run, and I then seek a suitable location to monitor it, do not have to follow its run, in order to save energy; if the other party holds the ball in hand, then it is not strictly prevented. The attitude of defense, is very appropriate to be calm, such as being deceived by the other side 装 , stay Wai opponent line blocking method, and must often pay attention to the opponent's eyes and footsteps, pre-guess its passing, or escape the straight line, in order to block the war and seize the ball.</p>
<p>(B) Five-Person Zone Defense Method</p>
<p>The so-called five-person zone defense method, that is, in our team's back court, divided into five areas, and one person is responsible for defending an area. The lineup can be divided into: Three in the front row, two in the back row. Two in the front row, three in the back row. Two in the front row, one in the middle row, two in the back row, etc. The former is the most common. The formation method is that as soon as our team loses the ball, the five members quickly retreat to the back court. The two defenders first retreat to the front of the enemy's basket, between the free throw line, each occupying the left and right halves of the field to defend it. The center and the two forwards retreat to the middle of the center line and the free throw line, three people in a horizontal row in the field, the two forwards each occupy the left and right wings, the center then guards the center, waiting for the other side to come to attack.</p>
<p>Until the enemy comes to attack, the method of defense, can also be divided into three types; One person defends one area, that is, each person is responsible for monitoring the enemy who walks into his defensive area. After the two skills, each monitor the first person rushing in from the left and right of the previous record, the front record forward, each guards the second person of the left and right sides, or the last person rushing in, the center is responsible for guarding, from the left and right guards of the third person, or the last person. To change the defensive area, echo each other's method, triple defense, that is, with the direction of the ball, transfer the lineup, so that at least three people, facing the way the ball came. The ball and divided into triple defense, so that the enemy holding the ball, is not easy to go deep into the attack.</p>
<h3>Sports Miscellany</h3>
<p>The athletic teams and football teams of the Three Provinces Athletic Association, as well as the women's basketball and volleyball teams, have achieved remarkable and commendable results, and their spirit is particularly admirable. It is now learned that the association has recently established a men's volleyball team, appointing Deng Xiaoliang as manager and Zhang Rui as captain. Deng is known for his capable handling of affairs, and Zhang Rui's ball skills are outstanding. Thus, the team's future is sure to be bright.</p>
