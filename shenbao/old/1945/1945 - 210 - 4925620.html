<h3>戰局無論如何推移國府決意不動搖陳代主席對日記者團談話</h3>
<p>南京二十八日中央社電二十八日下午四時半，陳代主席在官邸接見京市日木記者團，行政院周秘書長·宜傳部趙部長等均出席。陳代主席當就各記者所提訽之問題，詳爲解答如下：</p>
<p>（問）大東亞戰爭已至最後階段，國民政府之決意及施策如何？（答）國民政府對於大東亞戰爭，迭經聲明決意，決不以戰事之推移或時局之迫切有所動搖，迄）今仍秉初衷，不必贅述，一切設施自常以戰事爲重心。</p>
<p>（間）美國如在大陸沿岸作戰時，國府如何處　？（答）保衛中國木土，國民政府自有其職責，去年四月間軍委會即已着手爲軍事之新布置，沿岸美軍登陸，當與日軍悉力應付。</p>
<h3>全面和平促其實現</h3>
<p>（問）救國統一運動，國府如何加以促進？又今日全面和平尚有可能性否？曾否加以思考？（答）關於統一救國，爲國民政府旦夕所蘄求，上次民衆代表大會政府經已發表意見，力求實現，至今仍努力以赴，　意更進一步希望欲求中國之統一，須先求國府治下之政治。軍事·經濟統一，否則捷託空言，無裨實際。至於全面和平，在今日視之，涵義似非如還都時之狹，涵義旣廣，努力之方式亦自不同，要常視一般局勢爲轉移，國府正考慮時機與方式，然而鵠望全而和平之心，固始終不　。</p>
<p>（問）一般觀測目前國府無汪主席　都時代之熱烈，主席之之感想如何？（答）注故主席爲中國政治之有數領袖，逝世之後，國府頓失最高之導師，故鄙人之感想正與賭相同，惟現在時局緊張，人民態度漸變爲沉毅　付，自不同於還都當時，又一方面還都當時人民之希望過高，人民均抱較國民政府所抱者爲更高之希望，希望過高，失望亦大，人民對於戰爭依然存在之事實，實過於輕視，闊於此，　出關係當局加以激勵及協助。</p>
<h3>反共建國施策不變</h3>
<p>（問）謹間對於國共關係之觀察，及國府對延安政權之態度如何？（答）國府之政策爲和平反共建國，還都當時如此，今日亦如此。國共關係除非共黨放下武器並停止政爭，即不能視之爲立憲政治上之普通之政黨，國民黨創立五十餘年，中國國民均擁護國民黨。自立憲政沽言，決不能傾覆國民黨，因有國民黨，立憲政治乃爲中國民衆支持之團體，反此者政府人民均目之爲犯罪者而加以處罰，國共關係由此判斷可也。</p>
<p>（　）重慶公約實施憲政，延安亦決定召集憲收實施委員會，國府對暢達民意及人民參政之方策如何？（答）國府於還都當時，即設置憲政實施委員會，擬先實施憲政，其閱情勢進展，國府　加大東亞戰爭，因而憲政尚未見實施，眞正之憲政實施當在中國統一之後，延安完全與重慶對立，國民政府正冷靜注視其發展。</p>
<p>（問）今日經濟狀况極足憂處，未知隊府經濟調整及民生安定方策如何？（答）戰時經濟發生困難，乃各國普通現象，政府之政策在於調整經濟之困難，目下國府正詳加研究，進行改善中。目前應急之策有二：第一，軍需品與民需品同樣採辦，第二爲抑低金價。此二點雖非經濟之根本問題，實足救今日燃眉之急，事之可憂不在今日而在將來。</p>
<h3>世界形勢發表觀感</h3>
<p>（問）主席對世界形勢之觀感如何？（答）世界形勢　洲方面戰爭事僅爲暫時休息，並未吿終，據性有三：第一，資本主義者採取若干社會主義方式，社會主義者採取若干資本主義方式，以求二者之調和。第二，資本主義與社會主義立即發生衝突。第三，納粹之復興。關於第一點，可能性殊少，德國減亡後英美以爲資本主義已吿勝利，蘇聯之見解則相反。第二點可能性亦少，英美於法國西部築有防共陣綫，惟不能謂因有防禦即將發生戰爭，蘇聯擬借用美國之資木及技術，恢復國力。關於第三點，則有可能性，現在雖不能預　在何時何地，納粹再興極有可能，軍事爭鬥現甫吿終，政治爭鬥又已開始。總之，歐洲之現况，可視爲軍事爭鬥之中止及政治爭門之開始，將來不僅是政治爭鬥而再有軍事行動，甚爲開顯。太平洋方面亦直接烟接受其影饗，英美目的在於恢復殖民地，於殖民地之管理上將發生資本主義及社會主義之鬥爭，故世界戰爭實不易停止，自非舊金山會議等所能解決也。我東亞人士應嚴爲注意，並自己努力。</p>
<h3>特邱蔣發共同宣言蘇聯仍持固有立塲</h3>
<p>瑞典京城二十八日中央社電波次坦訊：美大總統特　曼，英首相邱吉爾，幷蔣介石聯名發表宣言，勸吿日本無條件投降，蘇聯政府鑒於與日本政府之中立條約，雖經特魯曼之再三勸請，但仍堅持其固有之立塲。</p>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電特魯曼，邱吉爾，蔣介石三人，二十五日於波次坦署名發表對日共同宣言，署名人之邱吉爾，於二十六日即因總選失敗而掛冠，又蔣介石之署名，聞係於事後以電話微很同意者，故事實此宣言實鴛美國所唱之獨脚戲。憶三十二年十一月之開羅會議，曾發表所謂對德無條件，現在美英重慶三國，無諭以政治上及戰略上，已臨緊要關頭，計無所出，乃墓倣過去，發表所謂最後宣言，然開羅宣言發表後，反引起德國國民澈底抗戰之決心。塞班島，硫黃島，冲繩島之決戰，敵人損失慘重，日軍戰意，因而大爲昂揚，故所謂無條件投降，自將爲日本所不理，當爲美政府所預料所及者，　美國國內因戰爭進展遲緩，不無焦慮，國民自觀人力消耗之慘重，嚴厲糾彈軍部作戰之失敗，同時目視蘇聯離開戰綫，從事戰後復興及世界處理，更感焦躁不安，美政府處狀熊之下，乃明示對日條件，求國民諒解，以求戰意之昂揚。</p>
<h3>共同宣言八項內容</h3>
<p>按：特魯曼·邱吉爾·蔣介石共同宣言之內容如下：　永久除去曾引起征服世界企圖之種威及勢力，　逐軍國主義。　爲確保實現我等之目標，聯介國佔領日本領土之各指定地點。　究全解除日本武裝。　嚴罰戰爭罪犯，日木政府應除去回復國內民主主義傾向之障害，　尊重基本的人權，確立信敎及思想之自由。　支持日本之經濟，且許日本擁有足以應付正當的實物本重整軍備之產業，不在現，且有基於日木國民意條件投降，否則日本將被迅速全面毀壞。</p>
<h3>東京各報紛紛評論</h3>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電此間各報今日就特書曼·邱吉爾·蔣介石之對日共同宣言，紛加評諭，茲誌其大要如下：</p>
<p>每日新聞：「特魯曼·邱吉爾·蔣介石之三國共同宣言，能度不遜，竟要求帝國解除軍隊武裝，完全廢止軍需產業，割讓國土。查我國遂行大東亞戰爭之目的，在於帝國之目存，自衛及將大東亞民族自英。美　絆中求解放，美國最近因戰爭順利，洋洋得意，過小評估日太戰力，妄以爲戰爭即將吿終，遂有此番三國共同宜言之發表。然今後之戰局，對於本土決戰，我人具有絕對自信，屆時我人必能澈底殲減美軍，已如軍事當局一再聲明，全國國民對此亦表示全面信賴，傾注全力完遂戰爭，故對於所謂三國共同宜言，實無一顯之價値，我人惟有貫澈始終，使敵人放棄戰意而已，至於政府之抱相同見解，當不待言也」。</p>
<p>朝日新聞：「觀英·美·重慶共同宜言，可窺知美國所意聞者，有以下數點：　因自國國內均渴望和平，乃故意提出宣言，使國民知悉如此條件，日本尚不接受，則除繼續作戰這外，無他途可循，故其目的實不外圖昂揚國民之戰意。　因强迫德國無條件投降，因之犧性慘重，國內人士不無非難之詞，因此，此番將若干條件吿知國民，求國民諒解繼續作戰之苦衷。　硫黃島·冲繩島作戰，美國方面出血慘重，故此次特發表條件，日本方而若不接受，則除繼續作戰外無他法，求國民繼續作戰。　誇示美國武力數量之鉅大，發揮宜傳上之效果，且擬籍離間大東亞各國間感情。　依制霸世界之傳統政策，强迫日木接受單方的條件，以達威嚇的效果。　謀離間日本國內軍民」。　渝方對延安提強硬要求</p>
<h3>渝方對延安　提強硬要求</h3>
<p>中央社滬訊據到達此地確實情報稱：蔣介石曾以陳誠名義，對延安拍發強硬要求覆電如次：　爲統一中國，團結各黨各派，實爲當前之緊急要務，延安應急速派代表琴加最近即將召開之閣民大會，且對國民大會之各關係洲題，應持妥協熊度，並應放棄召集解放地區人民代表大會一項計劃。　中央現雖完全認可第十八集團軍於華北各地之抗日戰綫，然華南華中方面之延安軍，應於重慶軍指揮下，協力美渝合作之軍事行動。</p>
<h3>日航空部隊轟炸冲繩島　並炸沉毀敵艦船三艘</h3>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電日航空部隊二十七日夜轟炸冲繩敵機塲及敵艦船羣，炸沉敵艦船一艘，炸毀二艘。</p>
<p>大阪二十八日中央社電B29型十四架，二十七日下午十時四十分許，在關門，周防灘，廣島海，岡出南方海上，盤旋投下機雷。又十時五十分起至十一時四十分左右止，B29型十五架，在若狹灣投下機雷後逸去。</p>
<h3>日各地昨空襲</h3>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電硫黃島基地之敵機P57型二百五十架，由二十八日上午九時半許截止下午一時，分三批來襲關東區，攻擊千業，茨城，　木，琦玉，羣馬，橫須賀各地，每隊均由B29型引導，對日方軍事設施，飛機塲等及其他市街地區工塲加以轟炸，並實施機槍掃射。又是日晨敵艦載機累計約七百架，由四國東南方洋上，分爲數隊空襲滋賀，岌阜，大防，香川，山口，廣島等地，敵機主要對日方軍事設施，工場，海上船船加以攻擊，日方被害極爲輕微。</p>
<h3>麥克活塞　傳將引退</h3>
<p>蘇黎世二十八日中央社電據倫敦電：此間頃接到電訊通信社華盛頓電稱，美太平洋司令部之言腦更迭，期將迫近，因該太平洋司令部內中各簡題極爲複雜，其中尤以政治問題早爲世人所周知也。於歐洲計劃作戰曾獲功績而現任總司令之麥克沃塞，與參謀總長馬歇爾之性格完全相反，當太平洋初期作戰時，因對美軍補給問題，即巳滋料紛，且麥克沃塞對馬歇爾之德國第一主義，會加以激烈抨擊，此種對立現象，至今仍繼讀存在，由於此等事實，故一般人士多觀測麥克沃寒於最折恐將吿退。</p>
<h3>英新閣組成　貝文長外交達爾登財政</h3>
<p>瑞典京城二十八日中央社電據倫敦訊：安納斯特·貝文已正式被任閣之外相，其餘各部大臣名單已經發表者如下：</p>
<p>財政部大臣達爾登，商務部大臣克里浦斯，樞密院主席莫立遜，司法部大臣喬威特，掌　大臣格林胡特。阿特里仍一如邱吉爾，以首相而兼財務部大臣與國防部大臣之職，同時莫立遜將被任爲英國下院領袖。尚有其他各部大臣之名單亦將於日內發表。</p>
<p>阿特里於昨日與一般工黨同僚會談多時，故外界推測阿氏對如何組織新內閣一事，事前已有佈置，同時阿民意欲早日赴波次坦，而邱吉爾將不偕渠同往，已爲意料中事。</p>
<h3>對印度問題謀妥善解決</h3>
<p>瑞典京城二十八日中央社電據此間獲息：新任英國外相貝文，咋日向印度民衆發表宣當，略謂，「我工黨決不放棄對在西姆拉會議失敗後之印度問題予以一妥善之解決，我工黨亦極擁　華維爾勛　之建議」。</p>
<h3>阿特里赴波次坦</h3>
<p>續三國會談</p>
<p>瑞典京城二十八日中央社電據柏林昨夜訊，英首相阿特里將於今日下午乘機赴波次坦，與史太林元帥特魯曼總統繼績舉行會談。</p>
<h3>粵褚省長發表談話</h3>
<p>廣州二十八日中央社電盟邦日本交還廣州灣租借地，褚省長特發表談話大意如次：盟邦尊重我主權領土之完整，於三十一年交還天津·廣州英租界，三十二年復交還各地日專管租界，今又交還廣州灣法租備地，更見盟邦積極協助我國之熱誠與決意，今後中日親密提携，當益趨發展。至廣州灣今復之行政，常自勉力求改善，使更趨繁榮，本人謹代表廣東省政府及人民向盟邦致無限謝意。</p>
<h3>浦開特附近海面擊沉毀巡艦兩艘　企登陸軍再被擊退</h3>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電本月二十五日企圖於泰領浦開特島登陸之敵軍一部約二百名，業爲日守備隊擊退。二十六日下午三時，敵之一部再以膠皮艇及小舟艇企圖登陸，日軍迎擊，再度將敵擊退，敵爲掩掮登陸軍隊，使一部艦隊接近上陸地點近海，砲擊日軍陣地，日空軍機隊及特別攻擊隊，是日下午六時三十分，擊沉敵巡洋艦一艘，擊毀大型巡洋艦一艘，所擊毀之大型巡艦，概爲改裝空母。</p>
<p>期評論</p>
<h3>星我的必勝信念（一）</h3>
<p>— 吉田東祐</p>
<p>問前年年底你在一篇「日本的反省」論文中說：</p>
<p>「日本因爲布亞洲諸民族中最先强盛之故，竟負起了這樣的歷史的命運，即不得不與美國金融資本傾向支配世界，尤其支配亞洲的事實發生正面衝突。日木萬一在這次與亞洲命運有關的戰爭一敗塗地，則中國也要受美國的金融　本支配。到那個時候，抗戰中國的一部份人當然命覺悟亞洲的命運是擊於自已國家，而要主張必與美國金融資本的　手開始作戰。」</p>
<p>一年半以前你以「萬一日本敗戰」的假定表示的這句話，到了現在我才覺得有點明白其意思了。當時在那稱情形之下，你也不得不避免更澈底的展開那個結論，因此使得各方面發生不少誤會。</p>
<p>答這個事實我也知道。當時有一個記者給我一對私信中坦白的說：不錯，像你說，美國金融資本要獨佔全亞洲的市塲或許是一個事實。而且日木正在與它作戰也是一個事實吧。可是在中國人方面，題並不在於這種地方，是在於日木是否要減亡中國的一點。日木爲何在中國進行戰爭，日木發起滿洲事變，是否爲了擁護中國的自主獨立？除非你使得這一點明瞭，恐怕我們中國人中沒有一個人來相信你吧。」我對於他這樣認眞的質問，不便以像　者要求那樣簡明的形式來答覆。然而我相信在我所撰述的所有文章之中，用和我保有自巳的本能互相調和的形式，透露了對於這個質問的答覆。不但是我自己，通迄今最說良心話的中日問題研究者，當討論中日問題的時候，祇談中國問題，　關於日本本身從來的作風則緘口如瓶。據中國人的觀　，日本人關於日本的作風一句都不說，不過說說有誠意或沒有誠意等抽象的話。日本人這種熊度之中可見其「偽瞞性」。　許多中國人到了現在下再提起日本在過去怎樣在中國尋末日資本主義發　的事。他們以爲過去是算過去的事情，不過日本將來對於中國究竟抱持如何態度，他們好像關於這一點要求日本有一個澈底的答覆，可是日本人到現在爲止，發揮連他們自已都不明瞭的「超理論」，一開始就大呼「日本的誠意」而漢有給過一次有內容的答覆。與此相反，日本人應該要反省一下，因爲他們過去所作的答覆，若是給認眞的中國人聽到就要　慨的。日本有名的一位政治家—他的名字我不發表—他曾好幾次就任在建設我國的一切重大問題中已經明顯的表現着。中日戰爭日俄戰學及最近的滿洲決變是不外於日木國民要維持東亞和平與安全的願望之例證」。若是滿洲事　是日木國民對於東亞和平與安全的願望之表現，中國人躊躇接受這樣的和平與安全，豈不是當然的事。</p>
<p>問　然而像日本這樣狹小的　土中，更有像日本這樣的人口增加　，它對海外，尤其對於人口稀少的滿洲實行發展，這不是當然的事麼？日本的耕地祇有國土的一百分之十六。耕地面積每平方英里的平均人口是二、七五〇人。這是世界最大的人口率。並且日本母分鐘平均出生四個嬰孩。據說長此以往，到了一九六〇年，僅僅日木內地的人口也要達到九十萬人。日本在此情形下，永久關閉在那狹小島孤烏上，豈不是等於日木民族的自殺麼？</p>
<p>答你所說的話，正是許多日本人所老慮的事情。以研究日本民族問題著名的小山榮三也在其著書「民族與人口之理論」中說：「日木亦因明治維新以來發達之機　生產及資本之有機的發展之結果。生產有急激的增加而足以吸收隨此而發生之人口增加部份。然近年因外　貿易提高障壁，拒絕日人進出海外，以致使其國內吸收人口之情形不能確實，更有產業之發展遲鈍或停頓，故除以人口壓力減低生產水平錢之外，無法緩和其飽和程度。在此狀熊中，唯有一種方法能打開此僵局。即以不可避免之軍事力在海外發見排水口是也。」</p>
<p>不僅是日本學者，「世界人口之危險區域」的著者托姆遜也指出一方面有人口巳經停止增加而不需要殖民地的國民支配着廣大經濟資源，在他方面則有因其人口增加需要殖民地的國民存在之事實而說「對於市塲及姿源之要求與對於新殖民地之要求互相鴛反此例…………此種矛盾即爲政治經濟的鬥爭之原因」。根據這個理論而推進，就可以說，民族的發展沒有停止，對於殖民地的耍求是不會絕止的，所以世界上從來沒有戰爭停止的時候。若是日本受這種人口理諭的指導，則絕對不會實現中日全面和平等事。因爲人口過多的現象不僅在日本，中國也有過分的人口。據逖特馬統計，中國耕地面積每平方英里的人口是一、五〇〇人乃至二、五〇〇人，即每平方英里的平均人口是二、〇〇〇人。中國比日木，其人口密度好像小一點，可是我們考慮中國與日本農業生產性的不同，就可知道中國人口的密度怎樣受着壓迫。我們從克烈賽曾於一九一五年製作的耕地面積每平方英里的人口密度表中，抽出土地生產性豐富的地方來看，就可發現驚人的數目。即江南丘陵地帶二、二四四人，東南海岸地帶二、六八四人，兩廣丘陵地帶三、四九五人，西南高原地帶四、八一九人。</p>
<p>中國不但是有這樣人口的密度，更有驚人的人口增加率。根據巴克敎授就八縣十一區包含二二、一六九人之代表的農家實行調查之結果，人口每千人的出生率是二〇·三人乃至七〇·五人，其平均出生率是四二·二人。這恐怕是世界最大的出生率吧。所以僅就人口問題而說，則會發生不僅日本，中國木身也不得不要求殖民地的結論。因此，若是日本爲其民族的發展有權主張進入中國，則中國也有權爲其民族的發展主張進入日本。日木若是不斷的重複主張像你說那樣的議論，中國能否安心和日本維持和平是一個疑問。</p>
<p>問　你所說的，眞有道理，然而我想實際上像日本這樣小的島國，若不以其民族在海外發展而所獲得的利益來交換食糧輸入國內，決不能維持下去。所以日本曾於和平空氣中企圖發展到澳洲及美國。然而這種和平的發展竟爲白種民族的利已主義所阻害，於是日本向滿洲開始發展，這個事情刺激了中國的民族主義而成爲中日交戰的原因。</p>
<p>答　若是堅持你的立塲就變成歐美人所考慮的「中日永久戰爭論」。這次中日間的戰爭不諭用任何形式來處現，中日兩方民族的發展旣然是必須的，將來必定再有兩方民族發展性發生衝突的時期到來。若是根據這種論理推進到世界和平　構也不能實現。所謂和平者是某一個民族的發展性壓住其他民族發展性的狀態。所以和平並不是眞的和平，必定是武裝的和平。在這樣的世界中弱小民族時常戰戰兢兢的擔心着爲其他民族所滅亡。這就是曾爲世界最大的弱小民族的中華民族所處的立塲。因此要使中日間的和平關係永久持續。並且又要世界和平機構永遠存在，應該有一個强固的保障先在相互民族發展性之間可能調整，於是日本在中日戰爭的半途提起所謂「東亞共榮圈」的理論。這是包含對於束亞諸民族各自發展性的衝突加以調整的意味。可是因爲展開「東亞共榮圈」理論的一部份人們，關於日本民族未能除去如「德國是在一切之上」這樣的思想，所以「東亞共榮圈」理論不能被中國人認眞的接受。中國人中有不少人以爲「東亞共榮圈」理論是日木民族爲了回滿達到其政治目的的一種政治工具</p>
<p>問　我聽你的詁，覺得你好像主張爲了中日和平可犧牲日本民族的發展性。你是要主張日本民族只好在日本小烏上　死的麼？</p>
<p>答　你這句話以最坦白的形式表示深刻的侵透於</p>
<p>日本人心目中的思想了。</p>
<p>這句話當中包含着「若是沒有方法調整中華民族的發展性與日本民族的發展性之矛盾時侯，只好犧牲中華民族的發展性」這樣的民族利已主義之主張。若是我在你的立塲，我所達到的結論是：爲了日本民族的發展，無論如何沒有辦法的時候只好犧牲中華民族，又日本民族更有進一步的發展則只好犠牲全世界。</p>
<p>前幾天有一個中國朋友給我看一本所謂「田中奏書」者。「中日事變與日本」的作者威洛比也說過這並不是眞的東西，然而假定田中首相考慮那樣的事情，就可以說這是把狹義的民族主義者的理想，最具體的表現出來了。不·德國，無論那一個民族主義者，在他心裏最希望自己民族是世界最優秀的民族，而且這種民族最好充滿全世界。尤其是盎格羅薩克遜人保持這種思想更强烈，這種民族主義者想到人口繼續增加，而其國土面積有限，則他當然要考慮應該擴大自己同胞能够自由活動的地域。世界的强國若是受這種民族主義思想的支配，弱小民族決不會有眞的和平狀熊。當日本展開東亞共榮圈理念時候，亞洲弱小民族方面發生一種不能十分理解的感情，這也是日本還沒有完全掃淸道種民族主義理論的緣故。問那麼你要否定馬爾　斯的人口論麼？</p>
<p>答　是的，我想許多的學說中沒有像馬爾薩斯人口論及其亞流這樣　動帝國主義者的學說。並　鴛了確立眞的東亞共榮國理念起見，必須指出那個理論的誤　。據說費亞邱爾的人口方　式是以近代的形式說明馬爾　斯人口論，現在讓我拿他的方程式來批評一下吧。</p>
<p>費亞邱爾斯所謂的馬爾　斯人口論，是更進一步，他除了土地的生產物（以L字表示此名詞）之外，還老慮經濟文化（EC）的生產物，而認爲這兩種生產物加起來的總數與人口（P）的比率是決定人口。並且以下揭的數學方程式表示人口愈增加，生活水準（SL）愈減低的事實。</p>
<p>SL（生活標準）＝L（土地生產×EC（經濟文化生產）／P(人口）</p>
<p>P（人口）＝L（土地生產×EC（經濟文化生產）／SL（生活標準）</p>
<p>簡單的說明這個方程式。就是：</p>
<p>人類愈增加，各人得到分配的生產物愈少，所以生活標準低落下去。又生活標準高起來，如果沒有生產物的增加，人口就減少，如果生產物增加，生活標準不動則人口耍增加。總而言之，他說人口生產物生活標準三者之間存在這個方程式所表示的比例關係。不僅這個人口方程式，馬爾薩斯人口理論也是，共根本誤謬是在於提到人類出生率時候，祗考慮自然的出生率之一點，在人類世界之中，實際上並沒有像動物一樣的自然的出生率。人類一生出來是社會的動物。人類的出生率是由依社會的各種規定所決定之社會的出生率。譬如自然界的動的到了生殖時期就開始生殖，然而人類的生殖行爲本身也由社會的規定所限制（就是結婚），所以就普通現象而說，到了生殖時期之後再經過相當的歲月，才開始生殖行爲。因此在人口現象不是由自然的東西決定社會的東西（生活標準），而是社會的東西（生產及生活標　）決定自然的東西（生產）道是很明顯的事。據費亞邱爾的方程式，土地生產（L）加經濟文化生產（EC）的總數決定生活標準（SL），因而更決定人口（P）的增加。日本與中國的出生率多而生活標準低的原因並不在於日本人及中國人自然的生殖力特別旺盛。日本及中國的生產關係（以LEC表現者）所決定的社會條件支持着高的生產率與低的生活標準是其原因。若是更具體的說，中國日本都在其生產關係之中保存多分封建的殘滓，所以生活雖然困難還要支持多產的封建社會風習仍然殘留。所以同樣的人口問題，居住都會的人與居住農村的人，其出生率相差得很大。舉一個例十吧，根據日本明治四十年的調查，都市的出生率是二六·六六人（以一千人爲單位）。鄉村方而是三三·九六人，然而到了昭和十六年度，其相差之數更大，都市二六·五三，鄉村三四。一一。我想都會的社會風習中已經消滅許多</p>
<p>封建性是其最大原因。</p>
<p>問　然而事實上，日木的人口比較土地更多，所以養育這些人口，必要很大的努力，是不待言的。查日本人口，在德川幕府時代三百年之間大概二千五六百萬。因爲當時日木尚在銷國時代，外國食糧不容易進口，所以日本農業可能養育的人口數，好像不過是這種程度。到明治維新以後，經辦工業，以其製品輸出國外，換取外國食糧，這樣一來，日木人口忽然增加，終於實現日本內地人口達到七千萬的現象。要維持現在人口數目，不得不維持現在的商工業。要維持現在的商工業，必須確保原料或者售路市塲。日本的資木主義與美國的巨大資木主義競爭頗爲困難，所以不得不在中國求其原料或售路塲。</p>
<p>答　不錯，所以可以說中國的資本主義和日本的資本主義國爭是當然的結諭。我看你的議諭好像說明日本資本主義進至中國的必然性，同時說明中國資本主義對於日木資木主義鬬爭的　然性。你考慮日本資木主義在和平裏與中國資木主義提携。當然有的時候資木主義國家間的輕濟競學不甚顯目，譬如某國的資木主義在重工業方面發達，其他國家的資本主義在輕工業發達的時候，在某一個期間，輕工業發達的一國從重工業製造的國家輪人機械而轍出其輕工業的生產物，所以有一種經濟均衡，不致於有激烈的經濟競爭。與此相反，在資木主義發展程度不太相左的國家之間，其經濟競爭傾向激烈化。　如日本及中國，這兩國都以輕工業爲主要工業，所以其經濟競爭的關係殊爲顯目，讓我們更詳細的研究這個問題吧。</p>
<p>試觀一九三七年日本對中國貿易的構成，日本全工業製品對中國的輸出數額四萬一千九百萬圓中重工業市塲所佔的百分比是百分之二九·四，輕工業市塲所佔的是百分之七十。又從中國輸入的數額八萬三千八百萬中，重工業市塲僅僅佔其百分之十二，而輕工業則佔其百分之八七·八。其次看到日本製造品在中國市塲所佔的地位，中國從國外輸入毛織線總數五八五。四二六元中從日本供給的佔其百分之九十五，絲織品七六一·九六八元中由日本供給的佔其百分之四十一·三，還有人造絲百分之七十七·三，至於麻布棉織品則百分之九十六。八是從日本供給的。在重工業方面中國輸入紡織機械及其零件共四，七七七，九三四之中從日本來的是百分之五十九·一，鐵管有百分之二十九，化學工業品中酒精佔百分之五十二·二，藥品佔百分之二十二·八，其他不足以論。根據以上所　的兩羣數字我們可以知道如下的事實。</p>
<p>第一，中國經濟機構仍以輕工業爲最有力的中心。第二，對於中國的日本經濟機構也以輕工業爲中心。</p>
<p>中國適用工廠法的工廠（即使用工人三十人以上者）總數是二千四百三十五，其資本總額爲四萬零六百八十七萬元，工人數爲五十萬人。其中紡織工廠的資木佔三成四分，工人數佔三成二分。由此可知中國的民族本是以紡織工業爲其中心。所以一九三〇年前後紡織資木的危機，就是中國民族資本的危機。又中日兩國的對立是以中國紡績資本與日本在華紡續資本的對立來開始的。一九三〇年中國排斥日貨是以日本棉製品爲對象，而以中國民族的紡績業排擊日本在華紡織業的形式展開其運動。</p>
<p>中日兩國經濟鬬爭如斯非常尖銳化，終於成爲中日戰爭的原因，這個事實是當我的考虜根木解決中日關係的時候應該最要注意的重點。</p>
<p>迄今許多人們以爲使得中國承認日木資本主義進入中國，就可解決中日戰爭。然而事實是與此相反，日本資本主義進入中國促進了中日兩國戰爭，所以你雖然說日本資本主義在和平空氣中進入中國，可是這種觀察不能就這樣給人家接受。這決不是上了軌道向着解決事變方向進行的辦法。那個有名的北一輝所著「中國革命外史」之精神主張日本應該援助中國革命遝動使中國達成自主獨立，日本不應該做英美的走狗侵略中國。日本人當中若是有人不能諒解這個主張是怎樣的正當，他恐怕不是眞的日本人吧。雖然如此，但是日本爲什麼在過去採用中國人以爲是帝國主義的政策呢？問題就在這一點。我們雖然可以承繼北一輝的精神，然而不許停止於北一輝的所諭。日木及中國的姿本主業發達時期比英美資本主義很遲，並且日本與中國的資本主義發達之程度相差不多——尤其兩國資本主　都集中於輕工業——以上的事實使中日兩國的經濟競爭激烈化。北一輝雖然那樣的警吿但是日本對華政策旣然成爲今天的樣子，所以我想除非把問題推進到如何解決中日兩國資本主義之矛盾的地步，很難使得中日兩國之間發生永久和平。（未完）</p>

<h3>加強空襲救災工作官民聯絡會議　市民福利會邀市府當局懇談</h3>
<p>上海市民福利協會空襲救濟委員會，　討救濟法庭護工作實際問題於昨日下午五時假市府會議案，邀請市府有關當局舉行聯絡會議，市府方面出席者，羅秘書長，胡副秘書長，淩秘書，劉秘書，警察局渡副局長，陽副局長，杉原處長，平　處長，保　處長，　生局袁局長，社會福利局周局長，市民防　本部野口處長。市民福利協會方面出席者，理事長關　亭，副理事長李思浩，理事　登，林康候，陳紹　，　陳日平，王伯元，鮑　昌，顴南　，楊撫生，陳彬蘇，總幹事胡　婷。首由開理事長李副理事長說明召集聯絡會議之意義。</p>
<p>各組工作概況</p>
<p>旋由救濟組王伯元報告該組工作概況：①關於死亡掩埋，②關於難民收容，計劃在每一保甲區至少設置收容所一處，③關於家屬死亡後老幼無依等等，並由陳日平項康原補充說明。綱由　藥組顧南　報告該組工作概況：平時各醫院已感牀位不敷，如有受傷者進院，事實上不可能以原住普通病人移讓。因此，一方面添設牀位，一方面設立專門救傷醫院，至於病牀及醫院房屋問題，希望市府竭力設法。並由　說明醫院水電配給不足，希望增加。其後，由總務組財務組陳彬　報告該兩組工作概況：第一期救災捐款目的二十萬萬元，分為災民糧食，醫藥用品，收容所經費，各醫院補助等四項各五萬萬元。第二期再募集充實防空及消防經費。②目前代收捐款處所計有申報及新聞報之社會報務處，南京興業銀行等三處，截止今年（二十八日）止，計申報代收二萬六千萬元。新聞報一萬六千萬元，南京興業銀行九千萬元，三共超過五萬萬元。③災民糧食，已定購麥粉一萬○五百袋，承粉麥統委會之熱心協助，每袋作價四萬九千五百元，僅及配給價之半，已交到五百包。④醫藥用品正在設法大批購辦，以應大量需要。</p>
<p>羅秘書長致詞</p>
<p>旋由羅秘書長致詞，略謂：“頃間聽到市民福利會諸位報告工作概況後，非常努力，極為欣慰。本人對於救濟工作貢獻幾點意見：①必須全面統　，不但包括官民，且須包括中外。②官民中外必須通力合作，即如每一單位救濟工作人員間，必須合作，醫務人員間必須合作等等。③人力物力必須集中，善於應用，不使浪費。總之，救濟工作重在敏穩兩字，敏者迅速，穩者不　。聽到各組報告以以後，尚有數點應予答復：①災區通力救護及聯絡工作，應由防空本部，警局警防處，及市民福利會各推派負責代表，另行商定技術上辦法。②醫院及收容所房屋問題，選擇地點適中，建築較好之小學校舍，學校暫時停辦，移作臨時醫院及收容所。③病床供給，以術生局現有者儘量供給外，並向　上各旅館平均借用床鋪連被褥一千副。如福利會贊成其事，市府即下令實行。④糧食及醫藥問題，除福利會已得一部份糧食外，醫藥部分應由新藥同業共同謙價供給大批必需藥品。近年新藥業較佳，為救災亦應稍　義務。⑤醫院水電增加問題，當由市府向　策公司交涉。但應防備萬一水電中斷時之補救辦法，如　井自　發電等。</p>
<p>野口處長報告</p>
<p>後由防空本部野口處長報告防空本部救護工作，並提出兩項問題：①福利會空襲救濟委員會是否為空襲時實施救濟之機關，與當局主管機構之聯　是否相同？②近來民間紛紛組織救災團體，福利會方面是否準備使之統一，以期不分散力量，而免浪費人力物力。當由陳彬蘇答復：①福利會空襲救濟會之性質，在集中民間一切人力物力，而受有關當局指導而從事救護救濟種種協力工作，井非單獨之實施機關，希望當局充分運用民間力量。②福利會對於民間熱烈發起之救濟護工作，均表示歡迎，但必須由　而達統一，使可貴之人力物力不致浪費。其後隨使　談，交換意見，直至七時散會。</p>
<p>各組聯席會議</p>
<p>市民福利協會空襲救濟委員會，於昨日下午三時半假市府會議室，召開各組聯席會議，到總務組，財務組，藥藥組，救濟組，勸募組各委員　總藥，李　庸，淵三省，沈　良，金雄白等二十余人，商討聯絡及推動工作，勸募組決定於三十三十一日舉行廣播勸募，希各界市民廣泛協力，並由金雄白提出工作意見如次：</p>
<p>①與防空本部取得　連絡，傳隨時可以確悉空襲點。②與市府連絡，取得通行　，隨時　趕出事地點救護。③各組應有　地點與終日專　辦理之負責人員。④救濟善與所缺乏之物品，隨時披露，指定捐助地點。⑤召集並　聘十三保甲區負責人，討論聯絡事宜。⑥從速設立收容所。掩埋處，及醫院。⑦與各醫院聯絡不得拒收受傷市民，並接洽補助經費事宜。⑧經費之收受與支配及支付辦法之規定。並由各組委員相互交換意見。</p>
<h3>敵美假借援渝名議實行全面支配</h3>
<p>島田報導班長發表談話</p>
<p>上海日陸軍報導班長島田中佐，於昨（二十八）日午前在報導常會席上，　美國假援助論政　之名，而實行向　內部伸　力之種種　談話如次：</p>
<p>藉口　渝伸展勢力</p>
<p>美國對於政權之輔助，　今可　已起　協助範圍，竟進一步而支配　政　之內部，此次事變，已　可否認，查美國之支配　內部，　全面支配其下海經濟等事等方面外，日察　中　報導力量，自向各部門實施分別　破方策，並對下屬組織機構，亦不　予放　。　美國認為　方下屬機構之組織散漫而　身份證，故尤注意此點。再如美國在渝方之發書權力擴大，亦出乎意料之外。總之，如今　政權不論在政治，經濟軍事上，非經美國之同意，決　順利推進其實施。他如實　開發，　生產組織，以及支配連機機關等等，　賴美國力量，力得進行。此項事實，在軍事方面而更為明顯。　舉例言之本年六月　，美國在渝特設駐中國特區職術司令部，由此　未得該司令部之同意，任何事務，均不　單獨而行，而該司令部本身之任。　大部份集中於下屬方面，如限制民間物資連輕，各種建設，將購物資，組織商業團體，以及管理物資等有關中國之血液命脈，均由美國直接掌握。</p>
<p>渝軍行動喪失自由</p>
<p>本年五月中旬，從緬甸渝之美國　士隊雖　於七月十六日解體，實際分散於各地從事訓練渝軍之任務，其目的無非欲將共勢力伸入渝軍各階層，深思熟慮，可見一斑。</p>
<h3>警察消費合作社歸還墊借資金</h3>
<p>明日起為期一星期本市民福利協會，　發起協助　局組織警察消息合作社，（現名警察福利社）並代向各業公會及各界　借資金，　息一分，定期一年償還。　經市府羅秘書長核准如數歸還，規定歸還辦法如下：</p>
<p>自七月三十日起一星期，售　日期。</p>
<p>原收據向市民福利協會（會址新聞路中國紅十字會）領取。</p>
<p>凡本利在五千元以下者，概發現鈔，五千元以上都，　發支票，尾數四舍五入（四十元者免除五十元者增為百元）</p>
<p>限期內不來領取者，逾期即代　捐本市空襲救濟經費。</p>
<h3>勿存觀望勿落人後盼富戶踴躍輪將</h3>
<p>昨日捐款又達高</p>
<p>本報讀者助學金勸募運動，近兩天來突見高　，創一千餘萬之最高紀錄，料想數千清寒學子，心裏覺得　當與　，預測失學問題，依然有救，不致“學校門面與　”！</p>
<p>昨天的捐款，有幾點值得告慰於讀者：①楊長康壽展節　助五百萬元，分　隊關係，與前天朱鳴玉群　義移助　款，可說後先難映，無獨有偶。像　功績德的祝　，我們很贊成，而且值得頌揚。②大誠織綢廠　人　必助巨款，從不失約，熟心毅力，為同人所欽仰。昨天又專程送來一千萬元，（其中半數充救災金）認榮藥隊兩　，足見該廠當局領導有方，高瞻遠矚，堪為一般工商企業家的楷模。③聖約輪大學校長沈　良愜捐五十萬元，認　通隊兩隊，沈校長首先倡導，想其他各校當局，亦必繼起於手。④大中毛紡廠捐助二十萬元，其中十萬元　附（家醫）二十冊，說是分贈工友，以　工友的醫藥當職，這真是一舉兩得的辦法。</p>
<p>我們除感謝各界熱心　助學運動之外，竭誠希望各方有錢的義士們，趁早慷慨助學，</p>
<p>此次美駐渝司令官　特曼，在西北各處視察，更視察渝軍領袖從未涉足之處。他如本年六月　美國議員團訪渝，視察各都市及各地，尤注意荒僻地區，而上述各地，均為渝方政治尚未完全　入之區。最近如捷諾德之調任，謂捷諾德擬強化渝軍，而與美當局之意見相左雲雲，其中蛛絲馬跡，不難想像，　渝軍中　在軍事指揮上，極度　美國之干預，倘美國直接支配渝軍，不論其形式如何，不　全部被美國所操縱也。美國方面似已感到渝方不滿，乃轉變政策，竭力避免指導權之表面化，而從側面掌握支配之實力，故籍詞改變戰術訓練，將其勢力深入渝軍各階層，從此渝軍行動將喪失自由，美國得此次支配權，即在戰後，亦可完全利用之，可見美國手段之巧妙。</p>

<p>中國企工銀行總經理鮑和鄉先生面雲：“本市迭遭空襲，無辜平民，慘　橫禍，同為人類，能不惻然。目下　後救濟，在在需費，貴報既提倡於前，敝行　追隨於後，勉效棉薄，共襄善舉，聊　互助之責，　廣同　之應</p>

<p>增進工友　醫藥常識</p>
<p>大中毛紡織廠函雲：“茲為醫院貴報助學運動起見，特率上國　二十萬元正，內十萬元以大中毛紡織染廠名義，捐入貴報讀者助學金普通　，尚余十萬元，捐助‘家醫助學金’，請給‘家醫’念冊，敝公司除救濟濟塞學子處，並將此濟分贈工友，以增進工人之醫藥常識，一舉兩得，家庭社會，均受其惠，不勝欣幸之至。”</p>

<p>中華星君昨來函雲：“人於昨日產生一男，為　應貴報助學運動，特節省各項俗禮，組成‘紅蛋助學隊’，茲奉上支票十萬元一紙，數雖至微而助學之至誠則一也，尚希察收。”</p>

<h3>The National Government's Resolve Remains Unwavering Regardless of War's Progression: Chairman Chen's Remarks to Japanese Correspondents</h3>
<p>Nanjing, July 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – At 4:30 PM on July 28th, Acting Chairman Chen met with Japanese correspondents from the capital at his official residence. Secretary-General Zhou of the Executive Yuan and Minister Zhao of the Propaganda Department were also present. Chairman Chen provided detailed answers to the questions raised by the reporters as follows:</p>
<p>(Question) The Greater East Asia War has reached its final stage. What are the National Government's resolve and policies?</p>
<p>(Answer) The National Government has repeatedly declared its resolve regarding the Greater East Asia War. Our determination will not waver due to the progression of the war or the urgency of the situation. We still adhere to our original intention, which need not be reiterated. All measures are naturally focused on the war effort.</p>
<p>(Question) How will the National Government respond if the United States engages in combat along the mainland coast?</p>
<p>(Answer) Protecting China's territory is the National Government's inherent responsibility. As early as April of last year, the Military Affairs Commission began preparing for new military deployments. When American troops land along the coast, we will cooperate fully with the Japanese army to respond.</p>
<h3>Promoting the Realization of Comprehensive Peace</h3>
<p>(Question) How will the National Government promote the national salvation and unification movement? Is comprehensive peace still possible today? Has this been considered?</p>
<p>(Answer) National unification and salvation are the National Government's constant aspirations. The government has already expressed its views at the recent People's Representative Assembly, striving for its realization, and continues to work towards this goal. We further hope and desire that to achieve China's unification, we must first achieve the political, military, and economic unification under the National Government's rule. Otherwise, empty talk will not be of practical help. As for comprehensive peace, its meaning today seems broader than it was at the time of the return to the capital. Since its meaning is broader, the methods of pursuing it will also be different. We must constantly adapt to the changing general situation. The National Government is considering the timing and methods, but our hope for complete peace remains unwavering.</p>
<p>(Question) General observation sees that the current National Government lacks the enthusiasm of the Chairman Wang's return to the capital era, what are the chairman's thoughts?</p>
<p>(Answer) The late Chairman Wang was a prominent leader in Chinese politics. After his death, the National Government lost its highest mentor. Therefore, my feelings are the same as everyone else. However, the current situation is tense, and the people's attitude has gradually changed to a steadfast response, which is different from the time of the return to the capital. Furthermore, at the time of the return to the capital, the people's hopes were too high. The people held higher hopes than the National Government. Excessive hope leads to great disappointment. The people underestimated the fact that the war still exists, and we should encourage and assist the relevant authorities in this regard.</p>
<h3>The Anti-Communist National Reconstruction Policy Remains Unchanged</h3>
<p>(Question) What are your observations on the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and what is the National Government's attitude towards the Yan'an regime?</p>
<p>(Answer) The National Government's policy is to build the nation through peace and anti-communism. This was the case when we returned to the capital, and it remains so today. Unless the Communist Party lays down its arms and ceases its political struggles, it cannot be regarded as an ordinary political party in a constitutional government. The Kuomintang has been established for over fifty years, and the Chinese people support the Kuomintang. From the perspective of constitutional politics, the Kuomintang cannot be overthrown. Because of the Kuomintang, constitutional politics is a group supported by the Chinese people. Those who oppose it are regarded as criminals by the government and the people and will be punished. The relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party can be judged from this.</p>
<p>(Question) The Chongqing Convention is implementing constitutional government, and Yan'an has also decided to convene a constitutional implementation committee. What are the National Government's policies for promoting public opinion and people's participation in politics?</p>
<p>(Answer) The National Government established the Constitutional Implementation Committee at the time of the return to the capital, intending to implement constitutional government first. However, given the development of the situation, the National Government engaged in the Greater East Asia War, and thus constitutional government has not yet been implemented. The true implementation of constitutional government will be after China is unified. Yan'an is completely opposed to Chongqing, and the National Government is calmly observing its development.</p>
<p>(Question) The current economic situation is extremely worrying. What are the government's economic adjustment and people's livelihood stabilization policies?</p>
<p>(Answer) Economic difficulties during wartime are a common phenomenon in all countries. The government's policy is to adjust to economic difficulties. The National Government is currently studying this in detail and is making improvements. There are two urgent measures: First, military supplies and civilian supplies are purchased in the same way; second, gold prices are suppressed. Although these two points are not fundamental economic problems, they are sufficient to alleviate the immediate crisis. The worrying thing is not today but the future.</p>
<h3>Expressing Views on the World Situation</h3>
<p>(Question) What are the Chairman's views on the world situation?</p>
<p>(Answer) In Europe, the war is only a temporary rest and has not ended. There are three possibilities: First, capitalists adopt some socialist methods, and socialists adopt some capitalist methods, to seek reconciliation between the two. Second, capitalism and socialism immediately clash. Third, the revival of Nazism. Regarding the first point, the possibility is very small. After the destruction of Germany, Britain and the United States believed that capitalism had triumphed, but the Soviet Union's view was the opposite. The second point is also unlikely. Britain and the United States have built an anti-communist front in western France, but we cannot say that war will break out because there is a defense. The Soviet Union intends to use American capital and technology to restore its national power. Regarding the third point, there is a possibility. Although it is not possible to predict when and where, the resurgence of Nazism is very possible. Military struggles have just ended, and political struggles have already begun. In short, the current situation in Europe can be regarded as the cessation of military struggles and the beginning of political struggles. In the future, there will not only be political struggles but also military actions, which is very clear. The Pacific will also directly receive its impact. The aim of Britain and the United States is to restore their colonies. In the management of the colonies, there will be a struggle between capitalism and socialism. Therefore, it is not easy to stop the world war, and it cannot be solved by the San Francisco Conference, etc. We in East Asia should pay close attention and work hard ourselves.</p>
<h3>Truman and Chiang Kai-shek issue a joint declaration, but the Soviet Union maintains its original position.</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, July 28th (Central News Agency dispatch from Potsdam): U.S. President Truman, British Prime Minister Churchill, and Chiang Kai-shek jointly issued a declaration advising Japan to surrender unconditionally. The Soviet government, in view of its neutrality treaty with the Japanese government, despite repeated requests from Truman, still maintains its original position.</p>
<p>Tokyo, July 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch): Truman, Churchill, and Chiang Kai-shek jointly issued a declaration to Japan on the 25th signed at Potsdam. Churchill, one of the signatories, abdicated on the 26th due to his general election defeat. Also, it is heard that Chiang Kai-shek's signature was given after the fact via telephone agreement. In fact, this declaration is a solo performance by the United States. Recall the Cairo Conference in November of the 32nd year, which issued a so-called unconditional surrender to Germany. Now, the three countries of the United States, Britain, and Chongqing, whether in political or strategic terms, have reached a critical juncture. Having no other option, they imitate the past and issue a so-called final declaration. However, after the Cairo Declaration was issued, it aroused the German people's determination to fight to the end. In the decisive battles of Saipan, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa, the enemy suffered heavy losses, and the Japanese army's will to fight was greatly enhanced. Therefore, the so-called unconditional surrender will naturally be ignored by Japan, as expected by the U.S. government. Due to the slow progress of the war within the United States, there is no lack of anxiety. The people, observing the heavy loss of manpower, harshly criticize the military's failures in combat. At the same time, seeing the Soviet Union leave the front line to engage in post-war reconstruction and world management, they feel even more impatient. Under this situation, the U.S. government clearly stated the conditions for Japan, seeking the people's understanding in order to boost their war spirit.</p>
<h3>Eight Items in the Joint Declaration</h3>
<p>Note: The contents of the joint declaration by Truman, Churchill, and Chiang Kai-shek are as follows: To permanently eliminate the influence and power that caused the attempt to conquer the world, eradicate militarism; To ensure the realization of our goals, the Allied forces will occupy designated locations on Japanese territory; The complete disarmament of Japan; Severely punish war criminals, the Japanese government should remove obstacles to restore domestic democratic tendencies; Respect basic human rights, establish freedom of religion and thought; Support the Japanese economy and allow Japan to possess industries sufficient to cope with legitimate material resources and not re-arm. Japan is allowed to conditionally surrender, otherwise Japan will be rapidly and completely destroyed.</p>
<h3>Tokyo Newspapers Issue Various Comments</h3>
<p>Tokyo, July 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch): The newspapers here today commented on the joint declaration to Japan by Truman, Churchill, and Chiang Kai-shek. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>Mainichi Shimbun: "The joint declaration of the three countries of Truman, Churchill, and Chiang Kai-shek is unbearable, demanding that the empire disarm its troops, completely abolish its military industry, and cede territory. The purpose of our country in carrying out the Greater East Asia War is to maintain the existence and self-defense of the empire and to liberate the peoples of Greater East Asia from the shackles of Britain and the United States. The United States, recently complacent due to the smooth progress of the war, underestimates Japan's war power and falsely believes that the war is about to end, and thus issued this joint declaration of the three countries. However, for the future of the war, we have absolute confidence in the decisive battle on the mainland. At that time, we will definitely be able to thoroughly annihilate the American army, as the military authorities have repeatedly stated. The entire nation has also expressed full trust in this and will devote all its efforts to complete the war. Therefore, the so-called joint declaration of the three countries has no value whatsoever. We can only carry through to the end and make the enemy give up the will to fight. As for the government's embracing the same view, it goes without saying."</p>
<p>Asahi Shimbun: "Observing the joint declaration of Britain, the United States, and Chongqing, it can be seen that the United States intends the following: Because its own country is eager for peace, it deliberately put forward a declaration so that the people know that Japan still does not accept such conditions, then there is no other way but to continue fighting. Therefore, its purpose is nothing more than to boost the people's will to fight. Because it forced Germany to surrender unconditionally, it suffered heavy sacrifices, and people at home have criticized it. Therefore, this time, it told the people some conditions, seeking the people's understanding of the difficulties of continuing the war. In the battles of Iwo Jima and Okinawa, the United States suffered heavy losses. Therefore, this time, it specifically announced conditions. If Japan does not accept them, then there is no other way but to continue fighting, seeking the people to continue fighting. To exaggerate the magnitude of the US military force, give publicity to achieve the effect, and attempt to alienate the feelings between countries in the Greater East Asia. According to the traditional policy of world domination, forced Japan to accept one-sided conditions, in order to achieve a deterrent effect. To sow discord among the Japanese military and the people."</p>
<h3>Chongqing's harsh demand to Yan'an</h3>
<p>Shanghai Central News Agency Information from the place of arrival confirmed, Chiang Kai-shek sent an harsh demand reply to Yan'an in the name of Chen Cheng, as follows:</p>
<p>To unify China, uniting all parties is the most urgent important task, Yan'an should be sent rapidly representatives to be added to the recent calling of the Congress, and to all Congress of a relation with continents, Ying Chi Tuo Xie bear degrees, and should give up convening liberation of areas People's Congress as a program. The center now, although fully approved the Eighteenth Army Group's anti-Japanese line of fire, however, Southern China and Central China's Yan'an army should under the direction of the Chongqing army, cooperate with the military movements of the US and Chongqing military</p>
<h3>Japanese Air Force Bombs Okinawa Island and Sinks/Destroys Three Enemy Warships</h3>
<p>Tokyo, July 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch): The Japanese Air Force bombed enemy airfields and warship groups on Okinawa on the night of July 27th, sinking one enemy warship and destroying two others.</p>
<p>Osaka, July 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch): Fourteen B-29 type aircraft, at approximately 10:40 PM on July 27th, circled and dropped naval mines in the Kanmon Straits, the Suo Sea, the Hiroshima Sea, and the sea south of Okayama. Also, from 10:50 PM to around 11:40 PM, fifteen B-29 type aircraft dropped naval mines in Wakasa Bay and fled.</p>
<h3>Air Raids Across Japan Yesterday</h3>
<p>Tokyo, July 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch): 250 enemy P-57 type aircraft from the Iwo Jima base attacked the Kanto area in three batches from around 9:30 AM to 1:00 PM on July 28th, attacking Chiba, Ibaraki, Tochigi, Saitama, Gunma, and Yokosuka. Each squadron was guided by B-29 type aircraft, bombing Japanese military facilities, airfields, and other urban areas and factories, and carrying out machine gun strafing. Also, on the same morning, a cumulative total of approximately 700 enemy carrier-based aircraft, divided into several squadrons, attacked Shiga, Gifu, Osaka, Kagawa, Yamaguchi, Hiroshima, etc., from the southeast of Shikoku. The enemy aircraft mainly attacked Japanese military facilities, factories, and seagoing ships. Japanese damage was extremely minor.</p>
<h3>General MacArthur Reportedly to Retire</h3>
<p>Zurich, July 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch): According to a London dispatch: A Washington dispatch from the news agency recently received here states that the replacement of the commander of the U.S. Pacific Command is imminent, as the various issues within the Pacific Command are extremely complex, especially the political issues, which are well known to the world. General MacArthur, who achieved success in planning operations in Europe and is currently the commander-in-chief, is the complete opposite in personality to Chief of Staff Marshall. During the initial operations in the Pacific, there was already discord over the issue of U.S. military supplies, and MacArthur fiercely criticized Marshall's "Germany first" policy. This antagonism still exists today. Due to these facts, many people observe that MacArthur will likely retire at the earliest opportunity.</p>

<h3>My Unshakable Belief in Victory (1)</h3>
<p>— Yoshida Toyosuke</p>
<p>Question: In your essay "Reflections on Japan" at the end of the year before last, you said:</p>
<p>"Because Japan was the first to become strong among the nations of Asia, it has shouldered such a historical destiny that it has no choice but to confront head-on the fact that American financial capital tends to dominate the world, especially Asia. If Japan suffers a crushing defeat in this war related to the destiny of Asia, then China will also be dominated by American financial capital. At that time, some of the people in China resisting Japan will naturally realize that the fate of Asia is tied to their own country, and will insist on starting a war with American financial capital."</p>
<p>A year and a half ago, you expressed this statement under the assumption of "what if Japan loses the war." Only now do I feel that I understand its meaning a little. Under those circumstances at the time, you had no choice but to avoid developing that conclusion more thoroughly, which caused a lot of misunderstandings in various aspects.</p>
<p>Answer: I also know this fact. At the time, a reporter candidly said to me in a private letter: "It is true, as you say, that American financial capital may want to monopolize the entire Asian market. And Japan is fighting against it, that may also be a fact. But for the Chinese, the issue is not about this, but whether Japan wants to destroy China. Why is Japan waging war in China? Did Japan initiate the Manchurian Incident to uphold China's autonomy and independence? Unless you make this clear, I am afraid none of us Chinese will believe you." I could not answer his sincere question in the concise form that reporters demand. However, I believe that in all the articles I have written, I have revealed the answer to this question in a form that harmonizes with my own instincts. Not only myself, but all researchers of Sino-Japanese issues who have spoken the truth to date, only talk about China when discussing Sino-Japanese issues, and remain silent about Japan's own past actions. According to the Chinese perspective, Japanese people never say a word about Japan's actions, but only talk about abstract things like sincerity or lack thereof. This attitude of the Japanese reveals their "hypocrisy." Many Chinese people now no longer mention how Japan sought the development of capitalist ends in China in the past. They believe that the past is the past, but they seem to demand a thorough answer from Japan about what attitude Japan will hold towards China in the future. However, the Japanese, up to now, have been expounding "super-theories" that even they themselves do not understand, and starting with shouting about "Japan's sincerity" without ever giving a substantive answer. In contrast, the Japanese should reflect on the fact that the answers they have given in the past would infuriate serious Chinese people. A famous Japanese politician—I won't reveal his name—has held several positions, and it has been clearly demonstrated in all the major issues of building our country. The Sino-Japanese War, the Russo-Japanese War, and the recent Manchurian Incident are nothing more than examples of the Japanese people's desire to maintain peace and security in East Asia." If the Manchurian Incident is an expression of the Japanese people's desire for peace and security in East Asia, is it not natural for the Chinese to hesitate to accept such peace and security?</p>
<p>Question: However, in such a small land as Japan, with such an increasing population as Japan's, is it not natural for it to develop overseas, especially in Manchuria, which has a sparse population? Japan's arable land is only 16% of its national land. The average population per square mile of arable land is 2,750 people. This is the world's largest population density. And Japan averages four births per minute. It is said that if this continues, by 1960, the population of Japan's mainland alone will reach 90 million. In this situation, would not permanently closing Japan in that small island be equivalent to the suicide of the Japanese nation?</p>
<p>Answer: What you say is exactly what many Japanese people are worried about. Koyama Eizo, who is famous for studying the problems of the Japanese nation, also said in his book "The Theory of Nation and Population": "Japan also developed due to the opportunities since the Meiji Restoration, as a result of the organic development of production and capital. Production has increased rapidly enough to absorb the increase in population that occurred with it. However, in recent years, due to foreign trade raising barriers and refusing Japanese people to enter and exit overseas, the situation of absorbing population in the country cannot be guaranteed. Moreover, the development of industry is slow or stagnant. Therefore, besides reducing the level of production with population pressure, there is no way to alleviate its saturation. In this situation, there is only one way to break this deadlock. That is to find outlets overseas with inevitable military force."</p>
<p>Not only Japanese scholars, but also Thompson, the author of "Dangerous Areas of World Population," pointed out that on the one hand, there are nations whose populations have stopped increasing and do not need colonies, dominating vast economic resources, and on the other hand, there is the fact that there are nations whose population increase requires colonies and said, "The demand for markets and resources contradicts the demand for new colonies... this contradiction is the cause of political and economic struggles." Based on this theory, it can be said that national development has not stopped, and the demand for colonies will never cease, so there has never been a time when wars have stopped in the world. If Japan is guided by this population theory, then the realization of comprehensive Sino-Japanese peace will absolutely not be possible. Because the phenomenon of overpopulation exists not only in Japan, but China also has an excessive population. According to Dittmer's statistics, the population per square mile of arable land in China is 1,500 to 2,500 people, that is, the average population per square mile is 2,000 people. China's population density seems to be a little smaller than Japan's, but if we consider the difference in agricultural productivity between China and Japan, we can know how the population density in China is being oppressed. From the population density table per square mile of arable land that Cressay made in 1915, if we extract the places with abundant land productivity, we can find astonishing numbers. That is, 2,244 people in the Jiangnan Hills, 2,684 people in the Southeast Coastal Area, 3,495 people in the Liangguang Hills, and 4,819 people in the Southwest Plateau.</p>
<p>China not only has such a population density, but also has an astonishing population growth rate. According to Professor Buck's survey of representative farmhouses in eight counties and eleven districts, including 22,169 people, the birth rate per thousand people is 20.3 to 70.5 people, and the average birth rate is 42.2 people. This is probably the world's largest birth rate. Therefore, just in terms of the population problem, the conclusion will be reached that not only Japan, but China itself must demand colonies. Therefore, if Japan has the right to claim entry into China for the development of its nation, then China also has the right to claim entry into Japan for the development of its nation. It is doubtful whether China can peacefully maintain peace with Japan if Japan constantly repeats the kind of argument you mentioned.</p>
<p>Question: What you say makes sense, but I think that in reality, a small island country like Japan cannot sustain itself unless it exchanges the benefits obtained from the overseas development of its nation for food to be imported into the country. Therefore, Japan once attempted to develop into Australia and the United States in a peaceful atmosphere. However, this peaceful development was hindered by the egoism of the white race, so Japan began to develop towards Manchuria. This matter stimulated Chinese nationalism and became the cause of the Sino-Japanese war.</p>
<p>Answer: If you insist on your position, it will become the "Theory of Permanent Sino-Japanese War" considered by Westerners. Regardless of the form in which the war between China and Japan is settled, since the development of both the Chinese and Japanese nations is necessary, there will definitely be a time in the future when the development of both nations will conflict again. If this theory is pushed forward, the structure of world peace cannot be realized. So-called peace is a state in which the development of one nation suppresses the development of other nations. Therefore, peace is not true peace, it must be armed peace. In such a world, weak nations are always trembling with worry about being destroyed by other nations. This is the position of the Chinese nation, which was once the world's largest weak nation. Therefore, to make the peaceful relationship between China and Japan last forever, and to make the world peace organization exist forever, there should be a strong guarantee that mutual national development can be adjusted. Therefore, Japan proposed the so-called "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" theory in the middle of the Sino-Japanese War. This includes the meaning of adjusting the conflicts between the development of the various ethnic groups in East Asia. However, because some of the people who promoted the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" theory failed to eliminate ideas such as "Germany is above all" regarding the Japanese nation, the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" theory cannot be seriously accepted by the Chinese. Many Chinese people believe that the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" theory is a political tool for the Japanese nation to achieve its political goals.</p>
<p>Question: Listening to your words, I feel as if you are advocating sacrificing the development of the Japanese nation for the sake of Sino-Japanese peace. Are you advocating that the Japanese nation should just die on a small island in Japan?</p>
<p>Answer: Your words express in the most candid form the thoughts that deeply permeate the minds of Japanese people.</p>
<p>These words contain the assertion of national egoism that "if there is no way to adjust the contradiction between the development of the Chinese nation and the development of the Japanese nation, then the development of the Chinese nation should be sacrificed." If I were in your position, the conclusion I would reach is: for the development of the Japanese nation, if there is no other way, the Chinese nation should be sacrificed. And if the Japanese nation has further development, then the whole world should be sacrificed.</p>
<p>A few days ago, a Chinese friend showed me a so-called "Tanaka Memorial." Willoughby, the author of "The Sino-Japanese Incident and Japan," also said that this is not a real thing. However, assuming that Prime Minister Tanaka considered such things, it can be said that this is the most concrete expression of the ideal of narrow nationalists. Not only Germany, but every nationalist hopes in his heart that his own nation is the most outstanding nation in the world, and that this nation is best filled with the whole world. Especially the Anglo-Saxons hold this idea even more strongly. When such nationalists think about the continuous increase in population and the limited area of their country, they naturally consider that they should expand the area where their compatriots can move freely. If the world's powerful countries are dominated by this kind of nationalist thought, weak nations will never have true peace. When Japan launched the concept of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the weak nations of Asia felt a kind of emotion that could not be fully understood. This is also because Japan has not yet completely cleared the theory of racial nationalism. Question: Then are you going to deny Malthus's population theory?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes, I think that among many theories, there is no theory like Malthus's population theory and its sub-streams that move imperialists so deeply. Moreover, for the sake of establishing the concept of a true East Asian Co-Prosperity State, it is necessary to point out the errors of that theory. It is said that Fei Yaqiu's population equation explains Malthus's population theory in a modern form. Now let me criticize his equation.</p>
<p>Fei Yaqiu's so-called Malthus's population theory goes a step further. In addition to the products of the land (represented by the letter L), he also considers the products of economic culture (EC), and believes that the ratio of the total number of these two products to the population (P) determines the population. And the following mathematical equation expresses the fact that the more the population increases, the lower the standard of living (SL) becomes.</p>
<p>SL (Standard of Living) = L (Land Production) x EC (Economic Culture Production) / P (Population)</p>
<p>P (Population) = L (Land Production) x EC (Economic Culture Production) / SL (Standard of Living)</p>
<p>To put it simply, this equation means:</p>
<p>The more humans increase, the less products each person gets allocated, so the standard of living declines. Also, if the standard of living rises, if there is no increase in products, the population will decrease. If the products increase, and the standard of living remains the same, then the population will increase. In short, he said that there is a proportional relationship between population, products, and standard of living, which is expressed by this equation. Not only this population equation, but also Malthus's population theory, its fundamental error lies in considering only the natural birth rate when mentioning the human birth rate. In the human world, there is actually no natural birth rate like animals. Humans are social animals from birth. The human birth rate is the social birth rate determined by various social regulations. For example, animals in the natural world begin to reproduce when they reach the reproductive period. However, human reproductive behavior itself is also restricted by social regulations (that is, marriage). Therefore, as a common phenomenon, after reaching the reproductive period, it takes a considerable amount of time before reproductive behavior begins. Therefore, in the population phenomenon, it is not the natural things that determine the social things (standard of living), but the social things (production and standard of living) that determine the natural things (production). According to Fei Yaqiu's equation, the total number of land production (L) plus economic culture production (EC) determines the standard of living (SL), and thus further determines the increase in population (P). The reason why the birth rates in Japan and China are high and the standard of living is low is not because the natural reproductive power of the Japanese and Chinese people is particularly strong. The social conditions determined by the production relations in Japan and China (represented by LEC) support high production rates and low standards of living. To be more specific, China and Japan still preserve a large amount of feudal remnants in their production relations. Therefore, although life is difficult, they still support the feudal social customs of high fertility that remain. Therefore, the birth rate of people living in urban areas and people living in rural areas differs greatly in the same population problem. Let me give you an example. According to a survey in Japan in the 40th year of Meiji, the birth rate in urban areas was 26.66 people (per thousand people). In rural areas, it was 33.96 people. However, in the 16th year of Showa, the difference was even greater, with 26.53 in urban areas and 34.11 in rural areas. I think the biggest reason is that many feudal characteristics have been eliminated in the social customs of urban areas.</p>
<p>Question: However, in fact, Japan's population is larger compared to the land, so it goes without saying that it takes a lot of effort to raise these populations. According to research, Japan's population was roughly 25 to 26 million during the 300 years of the Tokugawa shogunate. Because Japan was still in the era of national isolation at that time, foreign food was not easy to import, so it seems that the number of people that Japanese agriculture could support was only about this level. After the Meiji Restoration, it engaged in industry and exported its products abroad in exchange for foreign food. As a result, Japan's population suddenly increased, and finally realized the phenomenon of Japan's mainland population reaching 70 million. To maintain the current population number, it is necessary to maintain the current commerce and industry. To maintain the current commerce and industry, it is necessary to ensure raw materials or sales markets. It is quite difficult for Japanese capitalism to compete with American giant capitalism, so it has no choice but to seek its raw materials or sales markets in China.</p>
<p>Answer: That's right, so it can be said that the competition between Chinese capitalism and Japanese capitalism is a natural conclusion. I see your argument as explaining the inevitability of Japanese capitalism entering China, and at the same time explaining the inevitability of Chinese capitalism competing with Japanese capitalism. You are considering Japanese capitalism cooperating with Chinese capitalism in peace. Of course, sometimes the economic competition between capitalist countries is not very obvious. For example, when the capitalism of one country is developed in heavy industry, and the capitalism of another country is developed in light industry, during a certain period, one country with developed light industry imports machinery from the country that manufactures heavy industry and ships out its light industry products, so there is a kind of economic balance that does not lead to fierce economic competition. In contrast, the economic competition between countries with not too different levels of capitalist development tends to intensify. For example, Japan and China, both of which have light industry as their main industry, have a particularly obvious relationship of economic competition. Let us study this issue in more detail.</p>
<p>Looking at the composition of Japan's trade with China in 1937, the percentage of the market share of heavy industry in the total amount of 419 million yen of Japanese industrial products exported to China was 29.4%, and the percentage of the market share of light industry was 70%. Also, in the amount of 83.8 million yen imported from China, the heavy industry market accounted for only 12%, while light industry accounted for 87.8%. Secondly, looking at the position of Japanese manufactured goods in the Chinese market, out of the total amount of 585,426 yuan of woolen yarn imported from foreign countries by China, the amount supplied by Japan accounted for 95%. Out of 761,968 yuan of silk fabrics, the amount supplied by Japan accounted for 41.3%, as well as 77.3% of rayon, and as for linen and cotton fabrics, 96.8% were supplied by Japan. In the field of heavy industry, China imported textile machinery and its parts totaling 4,777,934, of which 59.1% came from Japan, 29% of iron pipes, and among chemical industrial products, alcohol accounted for 52.2%, pharmaceuticals accounted for 22.8%, and the rest are not worth mentioning. Based on the two sets of numbers mentioned above, we can know the following facts.</p>
<p>First, China's economic structure is still centered on light industry as the most powerful center. Second, Japan's economic structure in China is also centered on light industry.</p>
<p>The total number of factories in China that apply the Factory Law (that is, those that use 30 or more workers) is 2,435, with a total capital of 406.87 million yuan and a workforce of 500,000. Among them, the capital of textile factories accounts for 34%, and the number of workers accounts for 32%. From this, it can be seen that China's national capital is centered on the textile industry. Therefore, the crisis of textile capital around 1930 was the crisis of China's national capital. Also, the confrontation between China and Japan began with the opposition between China's spinning capital and Japan's spinning capital in China. In 1930, China's rejection of Japanese goods targeted Japanese cotton products, and unfolded its movement in the form of China's national spinning industry attacking Japan's textile industry in China.</p>
<p>The fact that the economic struggle between China and Japan has become so extremely acute, and finally became the cause of the Sino-Japanese war, is the most important point that should be noted when I consider the fundamental solution to Sino-Japanese relations.</p>
<p>Until now, many people have thought that making China recognize the entry of Japanese capitalism into China can solve the Sino-Japanese war. However, the fact is the opposite. The entry of Japanese capitalism into China has promoted the war between China and Japan. Therefore, although you say that Japanese capitalism entered China in a peaceful atmosphere, this observation cannot be accepted as it is. This is definitely not a way that is on the right track towards resolving the incident. The spirit of the famous Kita Ikki's book "An Unofficial History of the Chinese Revolution" advocates that Japan should help the Chinese revolutionary movement to achieve autonomy and independence, and that Japan should not be an imperialist stooge of Britain and the United States to invade China. If there are Japanese among the Japanese who cannot understand how just this claim is, he is probably not a real Japanese person. Even so, why did Japan adopt what the Chinese thought was an imperialist policy in the past? That is the problem. Although we can inherit the spirit of Kita Ikki, we must not stop at what Kita Ikki said. The fact that the development period of the capital industries of Japan and China was much later than that of British and American capitalism, and that the level of capitalist development in Japan and China was not very different - especially the fact that the capital in both countries is concentrated in light industry - intensified the economic competition between China and Japan. Although Kita Ikki warned in that way, Japan's policy towards China has become what it is today. Therefore, I think that unless the problem is pushed to the point of how to resolve the contradiction between the capitalism of China and Japan, it will be difficult to achieve lasting peace between China and Japan.

<h3>Strengthening Air Raid Relief Work: Government and Civilian Liaison Meeting; Citizens' Welfare Association Invites City Government Officials for Cordial Talks</h3>
<p>The Air Raid Relief Committee of the Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association, to discuss practical issues related to relief methods and protect relief workers, held a liaison meeting with relevant city government authorities at the City Government Conference Room at 5:00 PM yesterday. Attending from the city government were Secretary-General Luo, Deputy Secretary-General Hu, Secretary Ling, Secretary Liu, Deputy Director Du of the Police Bureau, Deputy Director Yang, Section Chief Sugihara, Section Chief Ping, Section Chief Bao, Director Yuan of the Health Bureau, Director Zhou of the Social Welfare Bureau, and Section Chief Noguchi of the Citizens' Air Defense Headquarters. Attending from the Citizens' Welfare Association were Chairman Guan Jiting, Vice Chairman Li Sihao, Directors Deng, Lin Kanghou, Chen Shao [], Chen Riping, Wang Boyuan, Bao Chang, Quan Nan [], Yang Fusheng, Chen Binsu, and Executive Director Hu []ting. Chairman Guan and Vice Chairman Li first explained the significance of convening the liaison meeting.</p>
<p>Overview of Work of Each Group</p>
<p>Subsequently, Wang Boyuan of the Relief Group reported on the work of the group: ① regarding the burial of the dead, ② regarding the accommodation of refugees, planning to set up at least one shelter in each Baojia district, ③ regarding the elderly and young left destitute after the death of family members, etc., and Chen Riping and Xiang Kangyuan added supplementary explanations. Gu Nan [] of the Medical Supplies Group then reported on the group's work: during normal times, hospitals already feel that beds are insufficient; if injured people are admitted to the hospital, it is practically impossible to transfer existing ordinary patients. Therefore, on the one hand, additional beds are being added, and on the other hand, specialized trauma hospitals are being established. Regarding the issue of hospital beds and buildings, it is hoped that the city government will do its best to find solutions. [] also explained that the water and electricity supply to hospitals is insufficient and hopes for an increase. Afterwards, Chen Binsu of the General Affairs Group and the Finance Group reported on the work of the two groups: ① The target for the first phase of disaster relief donations is 200,000 yuan, divided into four items of 50,000 yuan each: disaster victim food, medical supplies, shelter expenses, and subsidies for various hospitals. A second phase of fundraising will further enrich air defense and fire fighting expenses. ② Currently, there are three places for collecting donations on behalf of the organization: the social service offices of Shen Bao and Xinwen Bao, and the Nanjing Industrial Bank. As of this year (28th), Shen Bao has collected 26,000 yuan on behalf of the organization, Xinwen Bao 16,000 yuan, and Nanjing Industrial Bank 9,000 yuan, totaling over 50,000 yuan. ③ Regarding disaster victim food, 1,500 bags of wheat flour have been ordered. Thanks to the enthusiastic assistance of the Wheat Flour Unified Committee, the price per bag is 49,500 yuan, only half of the allocation price. 500 bags have already been delivered. ④ Medical supplies are being purchased in large quantities to meet the large demand.</p>
<p>Secretary-General Luo's Speech</p>
<p>Secretary-General Luo then delivered a speech, stating in brief: "After hearing the reports on the work of the Citizens' Welfare Association, I am very pleased with your great efforts. I would like to offer a few suggestions regarding relief work: ① It is necessary to have overall unification and coordination, including not only officials and civilians, but also Chinese and foreigners. ② Officials, civilians, Chinese, and foreigners must work together closely. For example, relief workers in each unit must cooperate, medical personnel must cooperate, and so on. ③ Human and material resources must be concentrated, used effectively, and not wasted. In short, the most important aspects of relief work are speed and stability: speed means quickness, and stability means no []. After hearing the reports from each group, there are a few points that should be addressed: ① The joint rescue and liaison work in disaster areas should be carried out by responsible representatives from the Air Defense Headquarters, the Police Bureau's Air Defense Division, and the Citizens' Welfare Association, who should separately discuss technical measures. ② Regarding the issue of hospitals and shelter buildings, choose school buildings in convenient locations and with better construction. Schools should be temporarily closed and converted into temporary hospitals and shelters. ③ Regarding the supply of hospital beds, in addition to providing as many as possible from the Health Bureau's existing resources, borrow an average of 1,000 sets of beds and bedding from various hotels. If the Welfare Association approves, the city government will issue an order for implementation. ④ Regarding the issue of food and medicine, in addition to the food that the Welfare Association has already obtained, the pharmaceutical industry should jointly offer a humble price for a large batch of essential medicines. The new pharmaceutical industry has been doing well in recent years, and it should also shoulder some obligations for disaster relief. ⑤ Regarding the issue of increasing water and electricity supply to hospitals, the city government will negotiate with the [] company. However, contingency plans should be prepared in case of water and electricity outages, such as [] wells and self-generated electricity.</p>
<p>Section Chief Noguchi's Report</p>
<p>Afterwards, Section Chief Noguchi of the Air Defense Headquarters reported on the Air Defense Headquarters' rescue work and raised two questions: ① Is the Welfare Association's Air Raid Relief Committee the agency that implements relief during air raids, and is its liaison with the responsible authorities the same? ② Recently, civilian disaster relief organizations have been established one after another. Is the Welfare Association prepared to unify them in order to avoid dispersing efforts and wasting human and material resources? Chen Binsu replied: ① The nature of the Welfare Association's Air Raid Relief Committee is to concentrate all civilian human and material resources and, under the guidance of relevant authorities, engage in various cooperative tasks of rescue and relief. It is not an independent implementation agency. It is hoped that the authorities will make full use of civilian forces. ② The Welfare Association welcomes the enthusiastic launch of relief and protection work by civilians, but it must be coordinated to achieve unification, so that valuable human and material resources are not wasted. Afterwards, discussions and exchanges of views continued until the meeting adjourned at 7:00 PM.</p>
<p>Joint Meeting of All Groups</p>
<p>The Air Raid Relief Committee of the Citizens' Welfare Association convened a joint meeting of all groups at the City Government Conference Room at 3:30 PM yesterday. Committee members from the General Affairs Group, Finance Group, Medical Supplies Group, Relief Group, and Fundraising Group, including [] Zong []yao, Li []yong, Yuan Sansheng, Shen []liang, Jin Xiongbai, and more than 20 others, discussed coordination and promotion of work. The Fundraising Group decided to hold a radio fundraising event on the 30th and 31st, hoping that citizens from all walks of life would cooperate widely. Jin Xiongbai put forward the following working suggestions:</p>
<p>① Establish close contact with the Air Defense Headquarters to be able to accurately know the location of air raid points at any time. ② Contact the city government to obtain permits to rush to the scene of the incident for rescue at any time. ③ Each group should have a fixed location and responsible personnel on duty all day. ④ Disclose the goods needed for relief and specify the donation locations at any time. ⑤ Convene and appoint responsible persons from the thirteen Baojia districts to discuss liaison matters. ⑥ Establish shelters, burial places, and hospitals as soon as possible. ⑦ Contact various hospitals to ensure that they do not refuse to accept injured citizens, and negotiate on subsidy matters. ⑧ Regulations on the receipt, distribution, and payment of funds. The committee members of each group also exchanged views.</p>
<h3>Enemy America Attempts to Realize Overall Domination Under the Guise of Aiding Chongqing</h3>
<p>Chief Reporter Shimada Delivers a Speech</p>
<p>Lieutenant Colonel Shimada, the chief reporter of the Shanghai Japanese Army Reporting Unit, made a speech at the regular reporting meeting yesterday (28th) morning, revealing that America is using the name of aiding Chongqing to extend its power internally. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>Using the Pretext of Assisting Chongqing to Expand its Influence</p>
<p>American assistance to the Chongqing government has now gone beyond the scope of assistance and has even reached the point of controlling the government's internal affairs. This incident is undeniable. The American control of the internal affairs includes the comprehensive control of its economic affairs. Furthermore, it is observed that the Chinese reporting forces are implementing separate breakthrough policies towards various departments, and they will not let go of subordinate organizations. The United States believes that the organization of the subordinate agencies is scattered and lacks identification cards, so it pays special attention to this point. Furthermore, the expansion of American publishing power in Chongqing is also unexpected. In short, the Chongqing government cannot smoothly promote its implementation in politics, economy, or military affairs without the consent of the United States. Other matters, such as practical development, production organization, and control of connected agencies, rely on American power to proceed. This fact is even more obvious in the military sphere. For example, in June of this year, the United States specially established a headquarters for the Special District of China in Chongqing. Without the consent of this headquarters, no affairs can be carried out independently, and the responsibilities of the headquarters are mostly concentrated on subordinate aspects, such as restricting the transportation of civilian materials, various constructions, purchasing materials, organizing commercial groups, and managing materials related to China's lifeline, all of which are directly controlled by the United States.</p>
<p>Chongqing Army's Actions Lose Freedom</p>
<p>Although the American training team that came to Chongqing from Myanmar in mid-May was disbanded on July 16, it was actually dispersed in various places to engage in the task of training the Chongqing army. Its purpose is nothing more than to extend the common forces into all levels of the Chongqing army, which can be seen at a glance after careful consideration.</p>
<h3>Police Consumer Cooperative Returns Loaned Funds</h3>
<p>Starting tomorrow for one week, the Citizens' Welfare Association, initiated and assisted the Police Bureau in organizing the Police Consumer Cooperative (now named the Police Welfare Society) and loaned funds on behalf of various industry associations and all sectors, with an interest rate of one percent, to be repaid within one year. Approved by Secretary-General Luo of the City Government, the funds will be returned in full. The repayment methods are as follows:</p>
<p>The sales date is one week starting from July 30.</p>
<p>Original receipts should be presented to the Citizens' Welfare Association (address: Chinese Red Cross Society, Xinwen Road) for collection.</p>
<p>For principal and interest below 5,000 yuan, cash will be paid. For those above 5,000 yuan, checks will be issued, with rounding to the nearest hundred (amounts ending in forty yuan will be omitted, and amounts ending in fifty yuan will be increased to a hundred yuan).</p>
<p>Those who do not come to collect within the time limit will be donated to the city's air raid relief fund after the deadline.</p>
<h3>Do Not Be Complacent, Do Not Fall Behind, Hope Wealthy Households Will Donate Generously</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Donations Reached a New High</p>
<p>The newspaper's readers' scholarship fundraising campaign has seen a sudden surge in the past two days, creating a record of over 10 million. It is expected that thousands of poor students feel comforted and believe that the problem of dropping out of school is still salvageable and will not lead to "schools only existing in name"!</p>
<p>There are a few points worth telling to our readers about yesterday's donations: ① Yang Changkang and Shou Zhanjie each donated 5 million yuan. Due to their ties to the [] team, they and Zhu Mingyu and others donated money on the previous day, which can be said to be difficult to emulate later. We very much approve of and commend such meritorious deeds. ② The owner of Dachang Silk Weaving Factory has always donated large sums of money and never failed to keep their promise. Their sincerity and perseverance are admired by their colleagues. Yesterday, they specially delivered another 10 million yuan (half of which was used for disaster relief) to sponsor two [] Rongyao teams, which shows that the factory's leaders have excellent leadership and foresight, making them a role model for general industrial and commercial entrepreneurs. ③ Shen []liang, the president of St. John's University, donated 500,000 yuan to sponsor two [] Tong teams. President Shen took the lead, and we believe that the authorities of other schools will also follow suit. ④ Dachang Wool Spinning Factory donated 200,000 yuan, of which 20 copies of "Family Doctor" were attached (Home Doctor), saying that they would be distributed to the workers to enhance their medical knowledge. This is truly a win-win situation.</p>
<p>In addition to thanking all sectors for their enthusiastic support of the scholarship campaign, we sincerely hope that all wealthy philanthropists will generously donate to the scholarship campaign as soon as possible.</p>
<p>This time, American Commander in Chongqing [] Te Man inspected various places in the Northwest, even places that Chongqing military leaders had never set foot in. For example, in June of this year, an American Congressional delegation visited Chongqing, inspected various cities and regions, and paid special attention to remote areas, all of which are areas where Chongqing's politics have not yet fully penetrated. Recently, such as the transfer of Jinuode, it is said that Jinuode intended to strengthen the Chongqing army but differed in opinion from the American authorities. It is not difficult to imagine the subtle clues in this. In the Chongqing army, there is extreme American intervention in military command. If the United States directly controls the Chongqing army, regardless of its form, it will be completely manipulated by the United States. The United States seems to have sensed Chongqing's dissatisfaction and has changed its policy, trying to avoid the superficiality of leadership, and instead grasp the reality of control from the sidelines. Therefore, under the pretext of changing tactical training, it has penetrated its forces into all levels of the Chongqing army. From now on, the actions of the Chongqing army will lose freedom, and the United States can fully utilize this control even after the war. It can be seen that the American methods are clever.</p>
<h3>Second Renaissance Festival to Be Celebrated; Relevant Authorities Actively Preparing</h3>
<p>August 1 of this year marks the second anniversary of the Chinese Renaissance Festival and the recovery of the Shanghai Concessions. In order to celebrate, the city's propaganda office has launched various propaganda activities. The office is now actively preparing with relevant authorities. In addition to holding a commemorative ceremony in the City Government Auditorium on the morning of that day, all entertainment venues in the city have been ordered to reduce ticket prices by half on that day to treat family members and celebrate the occasion. It is expected to be an unprecedented grand occasion.</p>
<p>In order to achieve widespread celebration, the city's propaganda office has previously notified the government administration offices and various district offices to conduct large-scale publicity. It is reported that the various district offices have also actively prepared after receiving the order.</p>
<p>Five Groups Hold Celebration Meetings</p>
<p>The city's citizens, the city's chamber of commerce, the National Party Affairs Promotion Association, the Industrial and Commercial Association, and the Xinhua Association's branch will jointly hold a Renaissance Merchant and Civilian Celebration Meeting to commemorate the second anniversary of the recovery of the Shanghai Concessions. It is scheduled to be held at the Grand Guangming Theater at 5:00 PM on August 1 (Wednesday). Director of the City Propaganda Office [] Cuntao will be invited to give a lecture, and the latest film "National Treasure" will be shown. Free tickets will be distributed to citizens for admission. A portion of the admission tickets will be distributed by the Shen Bao Social Service Office and the Xinwen Bao Information Office starting at 9:00 AM today (29th). Tickets are limited, one ticket per person, first come, first served, while supplies last.</p>
<p>Cinemas Show Early Morning Shows</p>
<p>The China Film Company has informed its affiliated cinemas to universally show early morning shows on August 1 and charge half price to celebrate the occasion, in order to assist the City Propaganda Office in launching a grand celebration of the August 1 Chinese Renaissance Festival.</p>
<h3>Deputy Director Man Instructs Subordinates</h3>
<p>Deputy Director Man of the City Police Bureau convened all branch directors, deputy branch directors, water patrol captains, deputy captains, and other personnel at the [] Building at 8:30 AM yesterday (28th) to instruct them. The main points are as follows: ① At this stage of air raids, all levels of supervisors must pay special attention to the anti-aircraft duties of officers, anti-aircraft technology, and the spirit of selfless service, in order to achieve the important responsibility of guiding citizens in air defense and rescue and relief. ② Sum up past work and encourage active transformation. ③ Strengthen police discipline and strengthen regular duties. ④ Describe in detail the director's care for the officers and police. We hope that all officers and police will fulfill the mission of wartime police with a fearless spirit. The meeting adjourned around 10:00.</p>
<p>Social Service</p>
<h3>Distribution Method for Funeral Expenses from Madame Zhou's Funeral to Aid Good Causes</h3>
<p>The funeral expenses from Madame Zhou's funeral to aid good causes totaled 10,000 yuan. On July 25, Li Sihao, Luo Junqiang, and [] Fu [] Zeng [] Chu distributed 4,000 yuan to the funeral. The remaining 6,000 yuan was distributed to 30 charitable organizations, with each organization receiving 200 yuan. The list of charitable organizations is attached below. The donations can be collected starting next Wednesday (August 1) by presenting receipts to the newspaper's social service office:</p>
<p>Home for the Elderly, Fuyou Orphanage, Andang Hospital, Huili Hospital, Yang [] Bang Orphanage, Xin [] Yutang, Hui Production Department Hospital, Shanghai Poor Children's Home, China [] Dao Yi Society, Shanghai Fu [] School, Dystocia Sanatorium, Women and Children's Relief Society, Nanshi School for the Deaf and Dumb, [] Sanatorium, China Leprosy Relief Society, China [] School for the Deaf and Dumb, China [] You Association, Buddhist Congee Factory, Prison Improvement [] Sheng Fund, [] Xing Guang [] Bitter Children's Home, Homeless People [] Mobile Station, Yao Road Fire Site Construction Site</p>
<h3>Broaden the Response to Aid Air Raid Victims</h3>
<p>Mr. Bao Hexiang, General Manager of the China Enterprise and Industry Bank, stated: "The city has been repeatedly subjected to air raids, and innocent civilians have tragically suffered misfortune. As fellow human beings, how can we not feel saddened? Currently, post-disaster relief requires expenses in every aspect. Since your newspaper has promoted it, our bank will follow suit, doing our best to contribute and jointly participate in good deeds, to fulfill our mutual assistance responsibility and broaden the response of all."</p>
<p>Do not be complacent, do not fall behind; to make the 30 million yuan scholarship fund reach its target as soon as possible. Heaven helps those who help themselves, benefiting both oneself and others, a great merit.</p>
<p>Disaster Relief and Scholarships: Two-Pronged Approach</p>
<p>Colleagues at Dachang Silk Weaving Factory stated: "The [] day is getting stronger and stronger, and disaster victims are gradually increasing. At this time and place, all of our citizens, those with remaining strength, should take a boat trip for the sake of co-suffering and raise the crown and silk. To overcome the difficulties, to see peace again, only in this way can we report the country in case of emergency. The colleagues in our factory have seen that, in addition to setting aside 5 million yuan of admission tickets in the fifth scholarship donation plan, we will donate another 5 million yuan for air raid relief, to show our hearts and do our best."</p>
<p>Increasing Workers' Medical Knowledge</p>
<p>A letter from Dachong Wool Spinning Factory stated: "In order to support your newspaper's scholarship campaign, we will donate 200,000 yuan, of which 100,000 yuan will be donated to your newspaper's readers' scholarship fund in the name of Dachong Wool Spinning and Dyeing Factory, and the remaining 100,000 yuan will be donated to the "Family Doctor Scholarship Fund." Please provide "Family Doctor" copies, which our company will distribute to the workers to increase the workers' medical knowledge. It is a win-win situation, and both families and society will benefit. We are extremely happy."</p>
<p>Save on Secular Rituals; Red Eggs for Scholarships</p>
<p>Zhonghua Xingjun sent a letter yesterday: "A man was born yesterday. In response to your newspaper's scholarship campaign, we have saved on various secular rituals and formed a "Red Egg Scholarship Team." I hereby offer a check for 100,000 yuan. Although the number is small, the sincerity of helping the scholarship is the same. I hope you will accept it."</p>
<p>Improvement in Treatment, Increased Hope for All Officers and Police to Complete the Mission of Wartime Police</p>
