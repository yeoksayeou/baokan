<p>南京通訊</p>
<h3>冷欣中將會見記</h3>
<p>— 本報南特派記者　寒若</p>
<p>在何敬之将軍未到南　之前，冷欣中将是目前華中最令人重視的軍官之一，為了要加　中國陸軍總司令部前進指揮所的情況，記者奉派赴　作專誠訪問冷中將之舉。</p>
<p>首都不及上海熱烈</p>
<p>自八月十日本發出求和廣播後，上海方面民眾即有熱烈的慶祝表示，國旗飄揚全滬、已歷兩旬，大規模的慶祝也在晃晃籌備之中，我們將想首都的民眾，必定具有同樣的慶祝情緒，　知到了南京一看大　不然，街頭上連一點慶祝勝利的氣息都聞不到，到處冷冰冰地，連國旗都没有懸掛．好像南　人對此似乎不太關心，真令人費解。</p>
<p>何總司令的前進指揮所設在中山北路華僑招待所，冷中將的辦公處則設於迎賓館，也就是孫立法院長的官會。</p>
<p>雖是新秋的天氣，悶熱比中伏天更甚，前進指揮所前，站立着英武的國軍，他們是新近隨冷中將開來南京的，都很年青壯健，和藹可親，在一位武士引導之下，會見了指揮所的參義刁作　氏。</p>
<p>外交名宿刁參議</p>
<p>刁參議是外交界的名宿，現任外交部顧問，因為指揮所有些外交事務要辦，刁參議逐負起這「前進外交」　的重任。六十多歲的刁參議，看起來不過五十歲左右模樣，　着軍服很帶點英武的氣態，前外交部情報司長刁　議就是他的公子，　喬　在中國外交界，都是很有名的人物。</p>
<p>承刁參議告訴記者關於前進指揮所的很多事情，可惜目前尚不能在這裏發表。</p>
<p>冷主任駐節的地方，離開指揮所不遠，蒙刁參議的指示和連絡，得機　訪了一次。</p>
<p>廣大的會客廳裏，等待着訪晤的人們，每隔數分鐘，一批一批的被請往主任辦公室晤談，　廳裏食具已經擺設了很久，而後來訪晤的人還是絡繹不絕，想見冷主任處理公務的勤勞，連進食的時間灰耽擱了。在會客廳裏等待沒有多久，我被輪着接見。</p>
<p>主任辦公室內，有幾位幕僚在埋頭辦公，靠牆的一軍，　着一排沙發，一疊公文書稿，陳放在沙發前的茶几上，在沙袋與茶几之間，冷主任静立着含笑招呼入座，謙和地，令人覺得有溫暖的快感。</p>
<p>「候久了！對不起，」　主任很親切地與記者握着手，同時吐出了謙遜語，是川貴的口音，態度誠摯，禮貌彬彬。</p>
<p>前進指揮所任務</p>
<p>為了時間的寶貴，記者扼要地提出了幾黜，請求指示，除了有關機密的不能發表外，都逐次解答。冷主任說：「本人奉何總司令命令，來　設前進指揮所，主要的任務是：　籌備總司令來之前應行舉辦的事項，　監督日本履行條約規定應辦之事項。連日中日雙方幕僚都忙於接觸遵令辦理一切。一俟中國陸軍總司令部進駐南京後，指揮所即行撤銷。關於日軍投降後之處理及國軍進駐各地區程序問題，軍委會業有規定。中國地區日軍投降簽字禮，由何總司令親自來　主持，俟總司令到　後，方能決定日期。」</p>
<p>抗戰中的經歷</p>
<p>關於中將個人在抗戰過程中的經歷，承中將告訴記者：「本人自二十八年即奉命在蘇浙皖一帶擔任游擊戰指揮，率部抗敵，本人是軍人，只知奉行軍令，不欲多所言論，故外界知本人在江南一帶抗戰者甚少。」</p>
<p>短短的身材，配上整齊的英軍服，烏黑的髮　分梳着，看上去只有三十四五歲的年紀，用簡練的語調答復客人的詢問，那麼簡單，扼要，有力，像軍令一樣，烟捲不常離口。態度沉靜而嚴肅，但有時亦給人親切的微笑，這就是冷欣中將的外貌。在五分鐘的談話裏，我覺得中將確是一位非常幹練，沉默寡言的典型軍人。</p>

These three armies consist of nine divisions, totaling more than 120,000 men. The above three armies are all equipped with American equipment, and their military appearance is excellent. Since June of last year, until Japan announced its surrender, these armies fought on the India-Burma battlefield and recently captured Liuzhou and Guilin.

<h3>Minister Wu's Speech</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Chongqing, 5th – A foreign reporter briefing was held at 3:00 PM on the 5th, presided over by Minister Wu Guozhen, Vice Minister Gan Naiguang, and Counselor Zhang Pingqun. After Minister Wu took office at the Propaganda Department on the first of this month, he hosted the briefing for the first time today, first delivering a speech to the reporters, declaring the mission of the Propaganda Department in the future, and promising to provide as much convenience as possible to the reporters in their work. Minister Wu first said: For the past three years, due to my responsibilities, I have developed close ties and friendships with gentlemen. In the future, I will provide you with various news, not propaganda, but frank, true, and reliable facts, hoping to provide you with many conveniences in your work. Minister Wu continued: Gentlemen, regarding the facts of China, you must take a fair attitude and a long-term vision to make accurate reports. Based on past experience, in the past few years, China has been subject to much criticism, but current facts prove that past criticisms were unfounded. I will cite two things as examples. In the past, various parties often reported that China might withdraw from the war. Regarding this point, the people of all countries must be very clear now that although China has suffered more pain and sacrifice in the eight years of the war of resistance than any other Allied country, surprisingly, China has not only not withdrawn from the war, but has won today's victory. In the past few years, Japan has continuously launched peace offensives against us, but all attempts have been strictly rejected. I believe that fair-minded people in the world will surely recognize that this is the will of the supreme leader Chairman Chiang, who has never given up, and the unwavering confidence of the people of the whole country. In the past, some people criticized China for being undemocratic and lacking freedom of speech. The center of the general criticism was China's censorship system. Regarding this point of explanation, first, we were fighting a war at the time. Any country has a censorship system during wartime, not just China. Second, we admit that China's organization is not as good as other Allied countries, so in times of emergency, we had to rely on the censorship system. Third, China has not yet had laws like the UK and the US, so we had to use the censorship system to suppress the remarks that the UK and the US could use the libel law to sanction. However, the censorship system will be abolished in the near future, this point can answer to the general criticism. Even more, gentlemen, you have been in China for many years, and from an objective point of view, you cannot but admit the progress China has made in recent years, compared with the situation in the previous warlord era, there is a world of difference. Fortunately, the Japanese invasion caused the democratic progress plans originally scheduled by Chairman Chiang and the National Government to be greatly hit. Now that the war has just ended, the various measures taken by our government recently should enable you to recognize that we have immediately continued the work interrupted by the war and are engaged in building a new China that is democratic and free. I hope you have a full understanding of this. Minister Wu said: In the future, my task is to give you various conveniences and assistance.</p>

<p>Nanjing Correspondence</p>
<h3>General Leng Xin's Interview Record</h3>
<p>— Special Southern Correspondent of this Newspaper, Han Ruo</p>
<p>Before General He Jingzhi arrived in the South, Lieutenant General Leng Xin was one of the most important military officers in Central China. In order to further understand the situation of the Forward Command Post of the General Headquarters of the Chinese Army, this reporter was dispatched to conduct a special interview with Lieutenant General Leng.</p>
<p>The Capital is Not as Enthusiastic as Shanghai</p>
<p>Since the broadcast seeking peace on August 10th, the people of Shanghai have expressed enthusiastic celebrations. National flags have been flying all over Shanghai for two weeks, and large-scale celebrations are also being prepared in full swing. We imagined that the people of the capital must have the same celebratory mood, but upon arriving in Nanjing, we found it not to be the case. There was not even a trace of celebratory atmosphere on the streets. It was cold everywhere, and even the national flag was not hung. It seems that the people of Nanjing do not seem to care much about this, which is truly puzzling.</p>
<p>General He's Forward Command Post is located in the Overseas Chinese Hotel on Zhongshan North Road, while Lieutenant General Leng's office is located in the Yingbin Hotel, which is also the official residence of the President of the Legislative Yuan, Sun Li.</p>
<p>Although it is early autumn, the sultry heat is worse than midsummer. In front of the Forward Command Post stood brave national soldiers, who had recently come to Nanjing with Lieutenant General Leng. They were all young and strong, amiable and approachable. Under the guidance of a soldier, I met with Councilor Diao Zuomin of the Command Post.</p>
<p>Diplomatic Veteran, Councilor Diao</p>
<p>Councilor Diao is a veteran in the diplomatic circle and currently serves as an advisor to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Because the Command Post has some diplomatic affairs to handle, Councilor Diao has taken on the important task of this "forward diplomacy." Councilor Diao, who is over sixty years old, looks no more than fifty years old and looks very heroic in military uniform. Diao, the former Director of the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, is his son. Both are very famous figures in Chinese diplomacy.</p>
<p>Councilor Diao told the reporter many things about the Forward Command Post, but unfortunately, they cannot be published here at this time.</p>
<p>Director Leng's residence is not far from the Command Post. Thanks to Councilor Diao's instructions and coordination, I had the opportunity to visit him once.</p>
<p>In the large reception room, people waiting for an interview were ushered into the Director's office in batches every few minutes. Dishes had been placed in the hall for a long time, but visitors continued to arrive one after another. It is conceivable that Director Leng is so diligent in handling official duties that even meal times are delayed. After waiting in the reception room for a short time, it was my turn to be received.</p>
<p>In the Director's office, several staff members were buried in their work. Against the wall was a row of sofas, with a pile of official documents placed on the coffee table in front of the sofa. Between the sandbag and the coffee table, Director Leng stood quietly, greeting me with a smile and humbly inviting me to sit down, which made me feel warm and pleasant.</p>
<p>"You've been waiting for a long time! I'm sorry," the Director shook hands with the reporter very kindly, while uttering humble words, with a Sichuan-Guizhou accent, sincere attitude, and courteous manners.</p>
<p>The Mission of the Forward Command Post</p>
<p>In order to save time, the reporter briefly raised a few questions and asked for instructions. Except for confidential matters that could not be published, they were answered one by one. Director Leng said: "I was ordered by General He to come here to establish the Forward Command Post. The main tasks are: to prepare for matters that should be handled before the Commander-in-Chief arrives, and to supervise Japan's fulfillment of the treaty provisions. Staff members from both China and Japan have been busy contacting each other to handle everything in accordance with orders. Once the General Headquarters of the Chinese Army is stationed in Nanjing, the Command Post will be dissolved. The Military Affairs Commission has regulations on the handling of the Japanese surrender and the procedures for the National Army to be stationed in various regions. The signing ceremony for the surrender of Japanese troops in the Chinese region will be personally presided over by General He when he arrives. The date can only be determined after the Commander-in-Chief arrives."</p>
<p>Experiences During the War of Resistance</p>
<p>Regarding the Lieutenant General's personal experiences during the War of Resistance, the Lieutenant General told the reporter: "Since the 28th year of the Republic (1939), I have been ordered to serve as the commander of guerrilla warfare in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui areas, leading troops to resist the enemy. I am a soldier and only know how to carry out military orders, and I do not want to say much, so few people outside know that I fought against the Japanese in the Jiangnan area."</p>
<p>With a short stature, matched with a neat British military uniform, and black hair neatly combed, he looks only thirty-four or five years old. He answers guests' inquiries in a concise tone, so simple, concise, and powerful, like a military order. A cigarette is never far from his mouth. His attitude is calm and serious, but he sometimes gives people a kind smile. This is the appearance of Lieutenant General Leng Xin. In the five-minute conversation, I felt that the Lieutenant General was indeed a very capable, taciturn, typical soldier.</p>

<h3>Forward Command Post Assists in Takeover Matters, Notifies All Agencies to Register and Stay in Contact</h3>
<p>The Forward Command Post of the Third War Area issued a notice yesterday, informing all party, government, military, economic, cultural, and transportation agencies in this city to register with the office within three days to facilitate assistance in the takeover of various institutions. The notice stated: "This headquarters has been ordered to take over the Nanjing-Shanghai area. Now, in accordance with the instructions of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and General Commander He, we have established a forward command post in Shanghai and a branch office in Nanjing to handle takeover matters in this area. The Shanghai office has temporarily started work on the fourth of this month at the Cathay Hotel on Nanjing Road. (The location of the Nanjing branch office will be announced in the Nanjing newspapers.) Now, in accordance with General Commander He's order, relevant agencies in each district related to administrative, economic, transportation, and cultural matters may send personnel to participate in the handling of takeover matters, and they will be under the unified command of the surrendered officials. In order to assist all parties in smoothly completing the takeover work, all central or local party, government, military, economic, cultural, and transportation agencies in Shanghai are requested to send personnel to register with this office within three days in order to maintain contact at any time. This is hereby announced."</p>
<p>Deputy Commander Zhang and Others Pay Respects to Representative Chiang</p>
<p>Third War Area Deputy Commanders Zhang Xuezhong and Zheng Dongguo, and Chief Advisor Xu Zuyi, paid respects to Representative Chiang the day before yesterday evening and reported the establishment of the Shanghai Forward Command Post. Representative Chiang personally received them and had a long conversation.</p>
<p>Representatives from All Walks of Life Visit Deputy Commander Zhang</p>
<p>The Shanghai Reception Office for Allied and National Armies sent representatives Yang Chengyao, Mo Qifa, and Mao Jiahua, accompanied by five female members of the Shanghai Branch of the Youth League, to visit Deputy Commander Zhang at the Cathay Hotel on the seventh floor at 4:00 p.m. yesterday to pay their respects. First, young woman Yang Zhiwei presented flowers, and then Mao Jiahua, on behalf of the citizens of Shanghai, expressed their condolences to Zhang and others and presented one hundred tins of Krik cigarettes to comfort the officers and soldiers. Finally, Deputy Commander Zhang delivered a thank-you speech. The representatives departed at six o'clock.</p>
<h3>Representative Chiang Strictly Forbids Strikes in Public Utilities, Violators Will Be Punished According to Military Law</h3>
<p>Yesterday, workers at the Yangshupu Power Plant of the Shanghai Electric Power Company stopped supplying electricity for more than two hours due to a dispute with the company over wages. Although the Municipal Party Department and the General Command of the Workers' Patriotic Salvation Army mediated and resolved the situation, the communication work of various telecommunications agencies was greatly affected. Representative Chiang was extremely shocked upon hearing the report, believing that public utilities are of great importance to people's livelihoods and security. In this transitional period, there should be no acts of sluggishness or strikes. He issued a notice strictly forbidding such behavior, stating that if such incidents occur again, they will be severely punished according to military law.</p>
<p>Protect Telegraph and Telephone Lines</p>
<p>The telegraph and telephone lines along the Nanjing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways have been repeatedly sabotaged by bandits, causing the interruption of wired telegraphs and long-distance telephones between Shanghai and various locations. The Jiangsu-Jiangnan District Telecommunications Restoration Office of the Ministry of Transportation, for military reasons, plans to repair them and has requested Representative Chiang to order protection. After receiving the report, Representative Chiang telegraphed the General Command of the Shanghai Mobile Corps and the Nanjing Advance Army Command to send troops to provide effective protection.</p>
<h3>Key Municipal Government Officials Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Eighteen important officials from various bureaus of the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Songhu Garrison Headquarters flew to Shanghai yesterday morning, including key officials from the Municipal Government and its subordinate bureaus such as Wang Zhuyi, Shen Zhenjia, Wu Tiecheng, Weng Xinmin, Li Kaidi, Dong Binzhen, Chen Yitong, Yao Shilian, Wang Yuankang, Zhou Shutao, Deng Yuan, Wang Jianxin, Zhang Da, Gong Shao, Wang Runan, and Wei Yousong; as well as Zhang Boting and Li Jinbiao from the Garrison Headquarters.

<p>Su Provincial Committee's Jin Renqian Arrives in Shanghai</p>
<p>Jin Renqian, a member of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee and a member of the Provincial Government, arrived in Shanghai from Hangzhou yesterday afternoon.

<h3>Gu Yuxiu and Others Depart for Beijing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Gu Yuxiu, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, Yang Xizhi, Special Commissioner of Municipal Food Administration, Secretary Wang Daren, and Li Chongnian, Special Commissioner of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Food Administration, departed for Beijing together yesterday on official business.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Vacate Three Barracks for Our Troops to Occupy</h3>
<p>The advance units of the National Army were delayed yesterday due to the hurricane and could not arrive in Shanghai as scheduled. According to the Dakwang News Agency, the forward command post learned that these advance units are currently stranded in Liuzhou, awaiting an opportunity to take off. If the weather is good today, they will definitely be airlifted to Shanghai. The Forward Command Post notified the Japanese side yesterday morning to vacate the Youth Association, the American Naval Club, and three other barracks occupied by the Japanese army for our troops to occupy.</p>
<h3>Temporary Office Established to Host National Allied Forces</h3>
<p>The National Army is about to arrive in Shanghai, and all sectors of the city are preparing enthusiastic receptions. In order to unify the reception efforts, the authorities in charge have established a temporary office for the reception of National and Allied forces in Shanghai, which officially began working at the Racecourse yesterday. The office has five departments, including General Affairs, Publicity, Fundraising, Security, and Comfort, to promote reception work. The first office meeting was scheduled for 9:00 p.m. last night, with more than ten people from various units and department heads attending to discuss reception matters.</p>
<h3>Allied Aircraft Fly Over the City and Drop Comfort Items</h3>
<p>Yesterday, five Allied aircraft flew over Shanghai, soaring and circling, causing great excitement among the citizens, who waved flags and shouted and set off firecrackers to show their welcome. The Allied aircraft then dropped comfort items over the concentration camps for Allied nationals in Pudong and Puxi, lasting for about an hour, before the aircraft left Shanghai one after another and returned to their original positions. Because the comfort items dropped by the Allied aircraft yesterday had small safety parachutes, there were rumors that paratroopers had arrived in Shanghai, which was actually a false rumor.</p>
<h3>Zhongjiujun Songhu Third District Command Post Transfers Defense to Liuhe</h3>
<p>Ruan Qingyuan, General Commander of the Patriotic Salvation Army of the Military Affairs Commission, in order to rectify defense and establish foreign public security in the city, ordered the Third District Command Post to defend Liuhe. Commander Zhang Baochen of the District, upon receiving the order, personally led his troops from the Fenglin Bridge Command Post overnight and arrived at the Liuhe defense area.</p>
<p>In addition, the vanguard corps of the Righteous Salvation Army had been engaged in underground work in Shanghai before Japan accepted the surrender. Now that the mission has been completed, it has been ordered to be disbanded. All officers and soldiers were ordered by General Commander Ruan to go to Liuhe, be compiled into the Third District Command Post, and incorporated into the Command Post. Also, the mission of the First Detachment of the Fourth District Command Post has also been completed and should be abolished. Commanders of the District, Ling Yuanpei and Zhu Shunlin, upon receiving the order, have abolished the detachment and handed over the officers and soldiers to the General Command for organization.</p>

<h3>Various Groups Telegraph Mayor Qian to Assume Office, Post-War Construction is Urgent</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Party Department, the Shanghai Branch of the Youth League, and various groups such as the Municipal Chamber of Commerce jointly telegraphed Mayor Qian yesterday, requesting him to assume office as soon as possible to preside over municipal affairs in order to seek restoration and construction. The original telegram stated: "Mayor Mugong Jian: Since the Japanese invaders invaded the east, this city, being located on the coast, was the first to fall. Subsequently, with the outbreak of the Pacific War, enemy troops entered the urban area. Since then, this corner of the sea has no longer had an inch of clean land. For several years, the people of the city have been living in deep waters and hot fires, crying out repeatedly, with no way to appeal to heaven. Now, fortunately, the War of Resistance has been won, and the sun has shone again. We have also heard that the central government has selected you, our public, as the mayor of this city. Your great plans will surely live up to the expectations of the people. The remaining people after the disaster are celebrating the recovery, their joy is beyond description. However, this place is home to people from all walks of life, and the situation is complicated. In addition, after eight years of occupation, the accumulated poison is deep, and it is urgent to eliminate the dirt. The post-war construction is especially complex, with everything waiting to be started. We sincerely hope that you will arrive early to console the people's longing. The telegram cannot express our anticipation. Shanghai Special Municipal Party Department, Sanminzhuyi Youth League Shanghai Branch, Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Shanghai Municipal Education Association, Shanghai Municipal Student Union, Shanghai Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, Shanghai Municipal Women's Association, Shanghai Municipal Association, respectfully."</p>
<h3>Hui Yuming Will Come to Shanghai to Take Over the Post Office</h3>
<p>The Central Government has appointed Hui Yuming, director of the Shanghai Postal Administration office, to come to Shanghai from Chongqing to handle the takeover. Accompanying Mr. Hui are five senior postal officials. Apart from Mr. Hui, who has already arrived in Nanjing, the rest are still waiting for a flight in Zhijiang. As for the Japanese postal workers in the Shanghai Post Office, they all quietly left on the 18th of last month. The twenty or more Japanese mail inspectors stationed in the post office also withdrew in the afternoon of the 15th of last month. However, the postal vehicles requisitioned by the Japanese side under the pretext of military needs have not yet been returned and need to be recovered after Mr. Hui arrives in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Overseas Mail Resumes Delivery</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration has announced that, as international conditions gradually return to normal, mail to Europe, the Americas, and Africa can now be accepted and delivered as usual. However, until transportation is fully restored, mail will be temporarily sent via Siberia to Moscow for forwarding.</p>
<h3>Overview of Mediation of Labor Disputes by the Commissioner's Office for Labor Movement</h3>

Now, with the victory of the War of Resistance, the newspaper officially resumes publication today.</p>
