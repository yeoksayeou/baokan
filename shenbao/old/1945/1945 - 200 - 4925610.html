<p>日本土某基地十八日中社電　敵自展開航空兵力後，其對本土之物量作戰，已告開始，日陸海空軍精銳爲把握機會，將敵人擊滅於洋上起見，現已完成應付敵軍侵寇本土作戰之一切準備，集中一切戰力，於本土各地俱已形成　固之要塞，記者獲得特別許可，得有機會參觀築於某山脈之地下工塲，勵　山谷間鱗次櫛比之地下工塲，投以驚異之眼光，山麓上一片水田，甫告插秧究了。記者等所一乘卡車，在光綫暗淡之山谷間通過，據引導人E少尉說明卡車經過地點，地下亦正進行開掘工作，一部份工塲已開工，有多數軍火戰士努力生產，其中並包括女戰士××名。自×月起開築之某地下工塲，規模宏大，其進行之速度有使人不敢置信者，規已有大批工作機械不分畫夜陸續運入，在未開工之前，已有豐當之水力電　供給，他如炭礦之熟練工，國有鐵道公司之隧道技術人負，大學地質學者，均積極努力，以及該地居民熱心勞設，此大軍火工廠已大部竣工。×萬名軍火戰士傾注全力，從事生一產新兵器。該地下工場入口處僅能容兩人，此因防止爆炸風力之故，深入××公尺後，裝置巨型工作機械××具，燈光照耀如同白畫，此種洞窟，在山脈中關有××處，此外尚有承包工塲，以及民營工塲等洞窟多處。當記者隨E少尉入內，見幼年生產戰士及女學生等齊向E少尉舉手敬禮，精種飽滿，使記者極感興奮，將來敵人即使如何展開新作戰，出動數千＋轟炸機，企圖摧毀日本生產力，惟地下軍火塲必能繼續爲求國家勝利而不斷生產。</p>

<h3>浙西見聞</h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者　湯毅</p>
<p>浙省富局蒞任伊始，對轄境內的實際情形，亟砍澈底明瞭，以爲決定其施政綱領的參考，爰有浙西視察團的派遣。組成這視察團的主幹，是綏靖公署參謀長張恒，代表綏靖公署；民政應長張鵑聲，代表省政府；此外有連絡部渡邊部長，省府宜傳科長潘鼎元等。記者以浙西迭遭破壞，交通斷絕已久，該方面眞相如何，常爲讀者所關懷，因願附驥同行；蒙視察團許可，又蒙潘科長沿途照拂，至爲感激。</p>
<p>這次視察的終點，是昔日以絲綢之富著稱全國的吳興（湖州），亦即是久被蹂躪，今日甚至有人在啃草根的吳興。從杭州到吳興，因爲新四軍關係，交通早已斷絕。自從項致莊氏所部國軍調浙駐防後，浙省實力頓見加强，又加以渝共軍隊在浙境衝突頗烈，最近以來經國軍協同盟邦部隊，展開大規模的掃蕩戰，述克城鎭數處，斷絕一兩年的杭州吳興交通，至此得告恢復。目前水道早已通航，僅班次比戰前少些，公路則因橋極全被破壞，破壞輕的已在修理，陸續可以使用，大橋則因材料關係，尙待建設當局的努力。</p>
<h3>塘棲</h3>
<p>自杭州循運河而行，兩小時抵塘棲，該鎭人口一萬四千餘，產水菓，全年產米祇供常地三個月消費，目前每石價五十餘萬。人民半數賴雜糧苞米爲生，轍入米糧都從嘉興無錫運來。當地僅有店三百餘家，隸屬於三十個同業公會，市况極爲蕭條，自從丁默邨省長下令撤銷關卡後，鄉人還繼的絡繹不絕，今後繁榮可期。敎育方面，有初中一所，學生百人，中心小學一所，私立小學七八所，共有學生七百餘。駐防當地的第三十六師師長陳問，非常熱心敎育，每月補助各學校敎職員食米三斗，最近因爲眾隊本身食米也不充裕，每名改貼米一斗半，餘數改貼苞米粉。</p>
<h3>德清</h3>
<p>過了塘棲，便是今春還由新四軍佔據的德淸縣，該城是六月十六日在盟軍協助下由三十六師克服的。兵　之後。景象凄慘，僅有人口兩萬餘，目前正在整理恢復，學校也在　設之中，現在僅有一臨時學校，有學生數十。產水菓，居民大都務農，恢復的大小商店，不過一百家，以糧食，雜貨店居多。當晚，視察團住在德淸北方的洛舍鎭。</p>
<h3>菱湖</h3>
<p>菱湖是吳興縣屬，街上戶口有一千，人口七八千。大都以養魚育蠶爲生，自三十二年盟軍撤防後，久在游擊隊棠中，恢復還不到兩月。現有三十四師一個團駐防，令鎭每月供應部隊食米七八石，鎭上有商店二百餘，有三十餘同業公會，對外交通有快班船。因爲地方富庶，雖在大要之後的靑黃不接時期，祗有十分之二吃雜糧，其餘仍舊吃米。米價每石五十餘萬，小麥每担二十六萬，鹽每斤三六〇元，麵粉每包十四萬，白糖每斤一萬四，豆油每斤六千四，柴每担六千元，洋燭每支三千，大英牌香烟每十支一千元。這是菱湖物價的大概。</p>
<h3>吳興</h3>
<p>吳興在戰前非常富庶，文化建設都很發達，戰後破壞極慘，新四軍也一度駐紮。目前有國軍第一師第三十四師及保安隊等設防，有警察三百人，水警三中隊約百餘人，又有盟軍駐在，防衛非常嚴密。</p>
<p>全縣分十區，縣城是第十區，有人口七萬，東南西北門是一，二。八。九區，共有人口九萬，第三區南潯有一萬六千人，第五區菱湖與第六區雙林，因爲攻服不久，正式的戶口統計還沒有。</p>
<p>當地向產絲綢，近因交通阻塞，種子來源缺少，銷路也淸，且成本過高，擊家經濟能力甚薄，大都停養，以至該業一落千丈，織綢工廠近兩年大都停工，開工者不過戰前十分之一，影響民生極大。目前開工工塲有碾米，製鐵和麵粉。有商店一千七百家</p>
<p>吳興食米雖也是五十餘萬一石，似因爲交通不便，採辦爲難，斗升小民，苦不堪言，四鄕有以草根當食糧的。該縣本有田一百五十七萬畝，目前荒蕪的很多。縣收入以田賦爲主，去年祗收兩百餘萬元，因之縣府經費拮据。今年改徵實物，情形可望改善</p>
<p>敎育機關：有省中一，學生四百。私中一，學生三百。公小九，區小九，私小四，學生七千餘人。就學生人數言，僅等於戰前十分之一，戰前中學校便有十二個。敎職員待遇甚薄，女性居多。省府已草擬新的擴展計劃，增多學級以容綱失學的及齡學童。</p>
<p>衛生方面，有福音醫院一，縣立醫院一。民衆團體有商會，同業公會，文化協會，安淸總會等。</p>
<p>浙江地處前綫，環境特別複雜，人民的苦痛因之也特別多，望治喁喁，若待雲霓。看罷了創痍滿目的浙西，不禁對毅然背負起收拾浙局的丁默邨氏，寄以無窮的期望。</p>
<h3>美失業問題　終無法解決</h3>
<p>經濟上一大矛盾</p>
<p>莫斯科十八日中央社電蘇聯經濟學者魯濱斯塔因氏，頃於「戰爭與勞動階級」維誌，就美國之勞動問題，論述加下：富一九四〇年此次大戰尚未勃發之前，美國失業者人數已達九百餘萬，戰後失業者之數字，將更形龐大。美國之失業問題，即在目前戰爭中亦甚深刻，其數逐日增加，按期各種軍需工塲及造船所汽車工廠，業有無數之從業員被解雇，一方退伍士兵於本國似無謀職希望，實際上退伍之士兵，本應繼續其以前職業，然於出征期中，國內之亢員已奮彼職，是故復職非常困難，此種現象可謂爲美國經濟上之一大矛盾</p>
<h3>食糧恐慌謂見好轉</h3>
<p>里斯木十八日中央社電據此問獲悉：美農業部長恩特遜就職後，昨發表第一次之廣播詞，略謂，美國糧食缺乏之情形，在此一九四五年整個一年中，極少有好轉之可能。美國人民所能護得之食糧，將較去年少百分之五，且在未來之數目中，將有主要食糧大感不足之危險，如肉油糖牛奶素菜等類。</p>
<h3>比國會議決　國王無執政權</h3>
<p>瑞典京城十八日中央社電　據白魯塞爾電訊：比利時下院業於昨夜以九十八票對三票之絕對多數，議決國王里奧波三世不能繼續執行憲政事務，除非再待兩院正式宣布渠之執政地位業告恢復。首相阿干於昨日下午曾將該案提交下院決議，於阿氏宣讀里奧波國王致攝政査里士親王之函件內容及加以抨擊後，下院即將該案付與立法委員會考核，最從始將該案提回與下院，以投票而議決之。按在正式討論該案之前，一般下院職員均蝟集於院外之應接室內，靜待阿千首相宣布在六名天主敎徒部長辭職後之革新內閣陳容。阿氏將該六空闕要職，在十名社會主義黨。共產黨。及自由黨要員之間選擇分配，其時天主敎徒黨員激烈反對，繼由阿干以宣　里奧波致査里親王之函件內容，開始國會會議，及後來又嚴厲抨擊，略謂，「書函內容所戴里奧波三世之意志，實不符國民之意志」云云。</p>
<h3>蘇聯波瀾間　簽訂新協定</h3>
<p>中央社訊　據塔斯社莫斯科電：蘇聯政府與波蘭統一臨時政府，經談</p>
<h3>學費徵收食米　敎部決予嚴禁　免致影響教育前途</h3>
<p>南京十八日中央社電　本京各級學校，以三十四年度第二期行將開始，紛紛奉辦招生事宜。據最近各校徵收學費雜費辦法，將改收食米或照現時米價收食米代金辦法。最近米價已達四十餘萬元高峯，一般民衆對生活問題，已感無法維持，如學費改徵食米，則失學者必因此激增，對敎育前途影響至鉅。中央設記者爲此，特往教育部叩詢究竟，當承答覆如下：學費改收食米一事，前因各地曾一度有此舉動，業經本部通令禁止，在目前本京及各地學校是否有此種計劃，本部向未接得報告，惟根據前令，不獨本部屬轄各國立學校，絕對不容有此種現象發生，即各地方學校亦不能公然以收取食米或用食米代金法充作學費，一經發現，本部自常立予嚴禁。</p>
<p>判結果，卒於本月十一日在莫斯科簽訂新協定，將戰爭時期內所規定波蘭鐵路管理辦法予以變更。兩國問談判各項問題，在相互瞭解與友誼之精神下，悉皆獲得圓滿同意，該新協定由蘇方交通人民委員長哥瓦了夫與波蘭交通部長拉巴諾夫斯基負責代表簽字。</p>
<h3>美海軍人員　蘇贈授勳章</h3>
<p>中央社訊　據塔斯社莫斯科訊，蘇聯最高蘇維埃主席團頃以蘇聯獎狀與勛章，贈予美國海軍人員。海軍後備人員。海岸防禦隊人員。以及海岸防禦後備隊人員等一百九十名，爲在對蘇美之共同敵人「希特勒德國」作戰時，因其優越之軍事活動，使軍事供應品源源不缺運至蘇聯北部。據報紙揭示得獎者，計其中五十名得愛國戰爭獎狀，二十五名納克魯莫夫勳童，二十五名得勇武獎章，又二十五名得奇功勛章。</p>
<h3>希特勒　生死之謎</h3>
<p>中央社訊　芝加哥「泰晤士報」紐約特派員，自巴拉圭蒙脫維杜發出報告稱：根據可靠消息，希特勒與女影星埃伐勃朗，已乘德潜艇抵達阿根廷海岸，現該兩人居住於柏塞哥尼亞地方某德國地主所有之院莊中。又據合衆社引「拉克里鐵卡報」消息，柏塞哥尼亞警察曾報告當局謂，有兩人乘一德國潛艇抵達此間。</p>
<h3>弗朗哥主張　恢復君主制</h3>
<p>里斯本十八日中央社電　據瑪德里電稱：企圖革新西班牙內外重大政策之弗朗哥元首，於十七日夜新臨西班牙國民黨全國評議會席上宣稱，爲恢復西班牙王政，將於適當時期召集國民會議，審議王政復古之方法。</p>
<h3>史太林抵柏林　三頭會談開始　推定特魯曼任主席</h3>
<p>中央設訊　據塔斯社柏林訊：蘇聯人民委員與蘇聯外委員莫洛托夫，業於七月十六日抵達柏林</p>

<p>瑞典京城十八日中央社電　據路透社柏林電稱：史太林議長於十六日到達柏林後，十七日偕同外委長莫洛托夫往訪美總統特魯曼於柏林郊外之「臨時白宮」，開始第一次會談，並與之共進午餐。同時邱吉爾首相亦與美陸長史汀生共進午餐，週一夜邱吉爾首相復設宴款待美參謀總長馬歇爾將軍，宴後又與之會談多時。</p>
<h3>德金融家提出　德改組計劃</h3>
<p>中央社訊　據塔斯社倫敦訊：現據德國英軍司令部之「每日先驅報」特派員報道稱，在一九三三年以前，曾供給資金與希特勒之德國金融家阿爾弗萊特，哈根堡，現已向英國軍政府提出改組德國經濟之計劃。該特派員謂，衆信此項計劃乃哈根堡應英國當局之要求而擬就者，其內容包括德閣全部經濟之改組，其中並警告德人，如生活之水準太低，則德國必將變成共產主義之國家矣。且此計劃並涉及德國「惡劣之命運」，對於目前缺乏「領袖」從事指遵國家之改組，表示莫大遺憾。該報在評論哈根堡計劃出現之社論巾載述：哈根堡之名字並不陌生，有一時期渠爲德國最顯赫之金融家，甚至在希特勒上台之前，渠即以金錢接濟希特勒，且渠曾任希特勒第一超內閣中之部長，事實上雖無任何證據可資證明，渠於德國　武主義者被擎毀之前，對於納粹理想之然情有所降落，然而哈根堡業早被公認爲德閣最惡劣勢力者之唯一象徵。渠以德國實業家自命，造成其潛伏勢力，可謂爲德國　武主義者背後之發動機也。詎料今日對於哈根堡不儘向其徽詢意見，甚且公然允許其隨便發言，對專門智識之金融與工業問題可以自由發揮，不受任何限制，並　告有「赤色之危險」，以爲郭培爾仍舊爲宣傳部長。又論及德國需要「領袖」，以爲一切必要莫如元首有人繼任，同時當哈根堡被允許發言時，不知何故職工會則不許發言，吾人雖據稱新職工會之政治氣息太甚，然哈根堡卻可喋喋不休而詆論共產主義之威脅。英國係於一九三九年對德國宣戰，納粹主義之德國實爲吾人之宿敵，故此吾人對於哈根堡此類人物與其所代表之一切，該須有一淸楚之計劃，從而可以徹底使其消滅</p>
<h3>蘇利用飛機　施行急救</h3>
<p>中央社訊　據塔斯社斯摩倫斯克消息，在距斯　倫斯克一百五十公里之某鄉村中，有一晟婦病重，當地醫生束手無策。電求帮助，於一點鐮後，即有一教授乘機自斯摩倫斯克飛到該地，此晟婦遂得慶生還。利用飛機急救，乃爲斯摩倫斯克州極普遍之舉，並聞斯摩倫斯克州之各村策中，刻正從事建造新的外科醫院與診所</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>敵機空襲緊急對策</h3>
<p>前昨兩日，本市若干地區遭受敵機轟炸，居民受災頗爲嚴重，本報昨日社評，對於此事，提出數點，喚起當局與市民的注意。但鑒於事態的嚴重，爰再進一步提供具體獻識如次。。</p>
<p>首先，應立即展開有組織的統一的被炸難民救助工作，本市市民福利協會義不容辭，應即負起民間領導責任，協助政府及有關機關，急起推動。一方面與與論界取得連絡，向各界呼籲捐歌救災，一面立即推動實際救濟工作，如　設立空襲災民收容所；　開辦空襲急救診療所；　成立空襲受傷念救隊；　設立無人認領及貧苦被炸犧牲者公墓；　普遍設立空襲下防護交通述絡及糾察隊，由民衆自力協助維持治安。所有這種急要事宜，當以政府督導協力而民開團體自辦爲原則，保甲及醫療西藥各業應自動協助，最主要的是：</p>
<p>第一，組織要簡單，以期實事求是。</p>
<p>第二，行動要敏捷，以期迅赴事功。</p>
<p>第三，官民密切協力，凡爲空襲急救所需，官民雙方絕對互信。</p>
<p>其次，本市疏散工作，急須加速進行。過去疏散委員會方面，因交通運輸上所遭遇之困難，進行不無迂緩之憾。最近對於交通工具已籌有相當辦法，各界市民急須常機立斷，早日疏散。特別是日前決定實行强迫疏故的一般慈善團體，至今仍無任何行動。其實慈善團體之疏散，本無問題，無非若干辦事人員，留戀上海，都持觀望而已。希望早日發動統散，其他學校工廠等，凡可能及必須離滬者，實宜迅速離滬。當局在此緊急時機，尤當攷慮採取强迫疏散辦法。對於外埠居民之來滬者，務須迅採嚴格限制方策。若大家在這種局面下再事觀望徘徊，除了各該社團廠商個人一旦遭損害之外，也正是國家社會的損失，深盼各界有心人士一致猛省，出而倡導，早達本市人口澈底疏散目的。</p>
<p>此外，本報日昨已曾指出，在空襲期內，不乏市儈奸商及投機份子，囤積生活必需物品，乘戰迫求暴利。此種行爲，就個人道德言，實無異於「趁火打刼」；就戰時法律言，更爲擾亂社會經濟破壞戰時秩序的行爲，我們一面希望各界在這危急時機，大家拿出中國人固有的道德觀念，縱不必人人見義捨利，亦央不乘危圖利，時勢愈是艱危，吾人愈是鎭靜守法。另一方面，我們仍盼有關當局，立刻對於市塲實行嚴格的監視，凡有散布流言，操縱市塲，乘機抬價的，應予嚴厲處罰。而實際上這兩天的物價，山於金條股票市塲的狂熱，一般人羣趨投機的結果，巳蘊蓄着波動的銳勢，所以，防止物價騰踊，不但需要嚴防市儈囤積居奇，同時，對於金條股票的交易市塲，亦應敵切注意投機活動。</p>
<h3>救濟失學與救濟失業</h3>
<p>— 浮雲</p>
<p>目前的上海，生活逼人，民不聊生，可謂達於極點，即以敎育而言，因爲學費昂貴，一般家長無力負擔，多數淸寒子弟，紛紛失學，預料本年秋季聞學，各校的學生人數將較上學期銳滅，這個嚴重問題，目前一般熱心敎育人士已在異常關懷，「搶救失學」的呼聲，各方面不斷在高唱着，本報助學金運動更不惜大聲疾呼，擴天募捐目標，多數熱心人士，羣起協力　將，成績美滿可期，失學靑年是獲得極大的援救了，可是在社會的另一面，更有着比失學還可僯的一羣，這就是失業的羣衆，他們在生活綫上掙扎着，期待着社會同情他們的人士予以救助</p>
<p>本報第十二期上海市政上曾經提出過上海最近失業人數激增的問題，　根據本市社會福利局職業指導所新近發表關於求職人數及求人人數的統計，四月份求職人數較之二三月份的指數日有增加，反之，四月份的徵聘人數卻日見減少，這一趨向便可反　出上海失業者的激增，問題如再嚴重下去，社會秩序將受絕大影響，將來發生如何結果，我們實屬不容漠視。</p>
<p>在戰亂時期，失集恐慌的形成，是無可避免的，其原因不外生活指數的高漲，社會環境的反常，戰時政策的統制，物資運輸的遲滯，經濟危機的嚴重等等，在使人工商各業日就渡落，甚至限於停頓，失業人數亦適而日增，再就失業羣的構成份子概括分析起來，總不出下列兩種來源：　被社會擯棄的從業員：這就是說從各業公司行號或機關團體中被裁汰的人員，他們原是有職業的，因社會不景氣或期他特殊原因，致被迫而成爲失業者。　向社會找出路的所年：他們或是修畢學校學程的畢業生，或是受經濟摩迫的乎途失學的靑年，大都急急於找　出路，來解決生活的困難，但是戰時所造成的社會環境，基於上述種種原因，對於原有的工作人員，尚感過　，那裏還有位置來容納這輩初出茅　的靑年，於是「沒有出路」的口號，在現代靑年們的口裏，隨處都能聽到，「人才」在今日的中國社會裏簡直無立足之地，這現象的綱續晟延，可能種下　大的危機！</p>
<p>試就目前社會各方面事實考察，我們可以看到一　失業羣　的苦　和掙扎，可是環境許可他們所走的路，決不是光明的前途，而是極端危險的畸道，舉例而言，如證券市塲之投機，貨物之圃積，單帮之版費等，這一難投機暴力的行徑，因爲本小利厚，容易取巧的原故，已成爲失業者心，目中唯一的出路，被裁的失業者獲爲丁一筆遣散費後，便以之從事上項的營生，企圖僥悻，甚至有失業靑年因無業可就，不惜雙賣惜貸，籌措小額款項，聯合其他失業者來往各埠，尃營單精買賣者，爲數甚多，一且遭遇不測，投機失敗，不但生機斷絕，甚且身敗名裂，挺而走險，其結果更屬不烘設想。</p>
<p>目前失業問題雖未至若何嚴重，惟危機潛伏，已不容吾人旁觀漠視，爲未雨綢繆計，常局及社會人士亟應對此失業問題，加以注意及硏究，統籌減少失業危機的對策及救濟辦法，羣試就管見所及，提出下列諸點，藉供商確：</p>
<p>實行疏散工作：失業者應向當局登記，經過調査後，疏散委員會或失業救濟機構當即參酌各個失業者之籍貫年齡能力及家庭狀況的殊異，強迫其向原籍或適當疏散目的地實行疏散，如次可使失業者得到適當的歸宿。</p>
<p>推進農村建設事業：在戰時體制下，增產實爲當前急務。農業生產之亟待改進，更屬改賣民生問題的先決條件，此種農村建設事業，正需要大量中堅有力份子，參加工作，極力倡導，失業羣衆中不乏智織份子，當局不妨利用他們，加以短時斯訓練組織。分派內地各處，從事農村建設實際工作，如農村合作社之倡辦，農業按術之改良，農村經濟之調劑，農民福利本業之舉辦等項；此外，擊村副業，荒地墾殖，　產開發各種工作之推動，亦可就社會失業羣中，遴選人材，給予爲國效勞的機會，其有裨於整個社會組織，當非淺尠。</p>
<p>扶助工商業之正當發展；失業之要因，起於工商業之衰落，一部份工商從業員，不幸慘被裁汰，多因市面不景氣所致，其因工作能力薄弱被載者，實佔少數，今後政府亟應取締投機暴利等不正富組織，而對含有生產性的正當工商金業，應以極大的力量，儘量予以扶助，如資金資材交通原動力各方面之給予便利，使被個經濟機構恢復穩因，市面漸人正軌，裁員之風不至滋長，有用人材獲得正當保障與出路，此外，小工業手工業及家庭工業，政府亦應極力提倡與協助，使失業者走人正當生產之途，不獨符合戰時增產方策，目可相當減少失業的恐慌。</p>
<p>政府機關勵行人材政治：政府機關過去因主管者引用私人，用人失當，每致影響行政效率，識者以爲政治不上軌進，不爲無因，今後政府對於用人應以人材爲主，並應予以相當保障，使能安心工作，除能力薄弱辦事不力的人員應予裁汰外，不得無故裁員，同時更須儘量採用公開考試制度，選拔眞正人材，給予優先錄用，分發各部門担任工作，於可能範圍內，對失業靑年，其有能力或學問者，尤應特予扶助，給予適常工作，使各就本位爲國家社會多盡一分力量，即減少社會一些無謂的虛耗。</p>
<p>推進國民義務敎育：國民敎　爲立國之本，我國敎育素極落後，戰時物價昂論，民生凋敝，淸寒子弟失學日衆，補救之道，義務敎育實屬首要措施，竊意在此國家危急關頭，國民義務敎育亟應普還推行，若能集合社會力量，在上海以及各地廣設義務學校，施行普及國民敎育，除經費由國家補助曁社會捐助外，其人力方面，不妨儘量利用失業智識份子，担任敎職工作，一方面可以救濟失學兒意，同時亦可以解決一部份失準者的出路問題。</p>
<p>發動失業救助運動，失業者大都爲薪工階級，平日貧苦已極，積蓄毫無，一旦驟失所業，生活愈感威脅，而欲另謀他業，更非易事，勢非東手待斃不可，故失業者之救濟，端賴社會有力人士熟心贊助，如小本貸金，隱貧救濟金，工商貸金，貧病貸金等之籌募，傳失業者經濟上獲得救濟，可以解決目前困難，甚且藉以自謀生計，此外，如學術研究獎助金之給與，工商計劃之徵集與資助，以及職業之介紹等項，亦得由政府與社會領導者聯合侶導，積極推動，如能單獨組織一失業救濟機構，以綜其成，隨時與社會各方聯絡合作，成效當有可觀。</p>
<p>最後，藉者以爲失業問題有關社會要全至深且鉅，失業恐慌如何防及救濟，切盼社會有力份子深切注意，更望能負起責任，倡導失業救助運動之建議，倘能由政府當局聯合社會熱心人士組織失業救濟所或失業救助委員會一類的組織，專賣辦理有關失業人員之登記調查研究設計及推行救濟各項工作，以廣大的社會力量作有計劃有組織的失業救助運動，至少在社會瓦助的意義上，是很有貢獻和價範的。</p>

<h3>街景</h3>
<p>— 熊煥光</p>
<p>天板像給頑皮的孩子放了一把野火，夕陽西下，柏油路二旁邊的小販攤子，也像剛從回祿塲搶出來的氣氛，零亂地點綴着這嘈雜的街景。</p>
<p>差不多全是從城　廟，玄妙觀，大觀園裏解散出來的。有幾條街上的飯攤，全沒有營業許可執照，不管冷的熱的，就像失去了保姆的孩子，涕淚滿面，絲毫引不起一些食慾，到處流浪着。他們的顧客，常是食量過大的健壯漢子，當幾條長櫈坐滿了的時候，飯攤前已是車馬盈庭，只見開鍋子的熱氣，聞着人頭擠動。三大碗落肚！兩條腿就待跟着鐵子兜個大圈子：販攤是我們交換勞苦的所在地，而他們正是飯權最親暱的生活綫上的知已。</p>
<p>鹹的甜的，粗的細的，米煮的，　打的，水裏的，油裏的；泰半都是經濟的採辦，最便宜的價鈿。碗壽都是粗糙的，桌面上的油垢，正是汽車輸下飛起來的泥沙休息所，這塊染色的抹布也要担任不少的雜務，臨了　得讓食客們抹一抹油嘴，揩揩警慣車　的汗手。</p>
<p>緊張，囂嘩；熟的，活的，逼眞的：但這盡面畢竟也太凡俗了，　上多毛的大腿，赤裸着半個身臉譜，太難一一狀其形容了。他們成天價混在太陽心裏；汽車電軍，二條腿穿梭子似的；你分辯不出他們的疲勞，明知汗流浹背，却不知他們心房　，湧有一股辛酸的熱淚。阪攤，你更沒法寫完它；零星的，散漫的；連販賣舊貨的攤十，小的米攤子；背的，挑的，提着筐子一片叫喊的……絕沒有如此偉大鏡頭，可把這一切活的衆生色相貼在一般悠閒人們的心目中去。</p>
<p>生活緊張了！除了空地作玩「把戲」的塲子外，連大小便的巷口都開闢成生活的營盤子。祗要地面舖張紙，點綴幾張久久不見的法幣。就又是一行了，任你一個單身行人，手堂裏玩着幾個銀幣也可交易賣買。這一旁是算命和測字攤士，那一張江湖嘴和一管沒落的筆，永遠是落伍定了！</p>
<p>路的轉角，樹的綠蔭下，都儲藏着人們精神的食糧——雜誌，報章，却留着幾個懶散的靑年人，像是被職業營驅逐出來的流亡兵丁，千千萬萬由鉛字匠排成的黑字厮混，轉手幾許輕薄的酬勞。</p>
<p>眼能，「衣」「食」「住」有許多人已不多和「死期」訂了合同，而「行」的問題，咸感舉步艱難，人「行」道已變爲生活之「華容道」，幾幾乎一全是攤販駐，加之沿途防空洞連接，來去人的面孔又是這般吃緊，則「將來」之攤販可以作爲「堡壘」，這「街頭生活火綫」也可以稍療小市民之　火嗎？</p>
<h3>浮生若夢</h3>
<p>— 慕羣</p>
<p>夜色降臨了大地，我獨自彳彳亍在那一片荒郊，無限凄情；一縷哀思；我懷着一顆秋的心。</p>
<p>是楓林橋畔的流水淙淙，是黑林深處的蟲聲啾啾，朋友，你可知道？皓月已經掛上柳梢，甜夢正瀰漫在人們的心底呢！道時，我還沒有歸去呀！</p>
<p>月兒的光是溫柔的，是明亮的，　使我在黑暗中找到路程，它使我看見了過去的生命——那些荒蕪的靑琢。</p>
<p>低吟那中古世紀的詩篇吧！這環境是够陶醉的，對於一個犬涯流浪的人。我冥想着，我立在瓦礫堆上。</p>
<p>四周荒凉得有些怕人，那殘　斷壁是够觸目的，是絕崖呢？是立屛呢？抑是破殘的堡壘！於是我幻想着：</p>
<p>「幾許年前，這裏曾是一塊樂土吧！</p>
<p>「幾許年前，這瓦　堆曾建立着一座高樓吧！裏面住着一羣高貴的人們，當這個時分，該正是燈火輝煌，笙歌如泉的時候吧！於是洋台畔傳過一絲絲琴聲，配合着雙雙情侶們的喁喁私語，織成了一個幸福的網吧……</p>
<p>然而　上桑間，這高樓如今變成瓦礫了，幸福的人們此刻正飄流在異鄕吧？這是紅樓一夢不？我有些茫然，我更幻想着！</p>
<p>「從遠遠的地方，馳來了一匹駿馬，上面坐着一個中古時代的英雄，他跳到瓦礫推上，舉起火炬，振臂高呼，把那些已死的生命都喚醒了，他（她）們狂歡着引吭高歌，把這片荒郊造成了一座樂園，無數幸福的人們，在裏面舞蹈……」</p>
<p>這該是多多渺茫的幻想喲！你沒有看見那些憔悴的幽靈嗎？這是一種悲哀！人們對我是不會了解的。</p>
<p>於是，我更想着那些靑　裏枯腐的骨髏，在過去他（她）們都是有血，有肉，有靈魂的生命，許是一個仁慈的老翁，許是一個熱情的靑年，許是一個嬌艷的女郎，許是一個天眞的孩子……朋友呵！你不是一個悲觀的人吧！但是當你想起了「浮生若夢」的時候，你就不會「消賤壯」嗎？</p>
<p>夜深了！我底心將被這野外的風吹得發抖了，我底身子也感到過度的疲憊了，我還不該歸去嗎？</p>
<h3>受寵</h3>
<p>— 岑嘉</p>
<p>電車雖然廢除了三等，前後一視同仁了，可是穿畏衫着西裝的人們總是儘先朝原來的頭等車廂裏擠去；而一班穿短打的販夫走卒們雖然化了同樣的車價，大多數也還是很識相的踏上原來的三等車廂，不大敢越出範圍。他們大約很明白：在一羣衣冠楚楚的紳士淑女中，假使有一個穿得很隨便的粗人擠在裏面，惹得這了個皺皺眉頭，那個握握鼻子，空氣未免太不調和了，還是擠在乘慣的三等車裏好。就是因此碰痛別人，鬧得打起相打來，也强如擠在前面聽我們的小姐奶奶們怪聲的說，「儂那能格拉，軋點啥？」</p>
<p>我雖然不怎麼看電我的長衫，但在下意識裏長衫的魔力總是佔着重要的位置。所以每逢軍車，總剪頭等車廂擠。</p>
<p>然而這一天，當然趕到電車站時，雖有一輛車停着，但看看前節車裏的乘客已經很多，月台上還有許多人等着上去。拖車裏倒還空，我算算時間上已經不允許再等第二輛，只得跳上了拖車。</p>
<p>跳上了拖車之後，我就站在一個坐着的工人模樣的人面前。坐的人坐得並不緊，再加一個人去，也不見得怎麽擠。但我因爲天氣熱，又因爲　惜自已的紡綢長衫，並不想坐。不過那工人模樣的人還以爲我走近主爲的是要坐，馬上叫隔壁的人坐過去點，讓出一個座位來。我覺得却之不恭，便順着他的意思坐下去。但我的身體還沒有碰到椅上，那人忽然說道：</p>
<p>「你把長衫撩一把，當心坐皺！」說家常話似的，一點都不做作。我於是把他細細的打量一番，他穿着一套黑洋布的短衫褲，已經舊得很了，有幾處已有點獲破。多皺紋的黝黑的臉和四肢顯示着飽經許多滄桑。他不時用手揩拭着額上的</p>
<p>汗。</p>
<p>我在感激之餘，很想同他談談，可是一時却找不到適當的話來說。我們一向說慣的是文縐縐的語言，那在我們自己聽起來的確是頭頭是道，悅耳之至的；然而我們倘要表達一個意思，往往要轉好幾各彎，等到發出聲音，已經蒙着重重的帷幕了。用這種話去跟他們攀談，他們一定會感察格格不入，無從了解的</p>
<p>一直到電車開到的目的地，我想不出一句話來說。</p>
<p>我終於帶着歉意的立」起來，看了那人一眼，於是向門口走去。</p>
<p>近門口處，有一個人把右腿架在左腿上，腳突得很出，如果筆直走去，長衫上一定會沾到脚底的一鹿垢和痰沫的，我芷打算避開那隻腳出去時，坐在架起大腿那人旁邊的一個人——他穿着一身發了黃的白短衫褲——却搶着說：</p>
<p>「——喂，你！」</p>
<p>一邊說，一邊還伸出手來把那人的大腿輕輕的拍了一下於是那條腿立刻放下去了。</p>
<p>「——這眞是無獨有偶！」</p>
<p>我跳下了電車，這樣的自言自語着。</p>
<p>讓坐位，告訴我別把長衫坐皺，叫人把脚放下去——這些都是平几的事。然而正因爲是平凡，也就愈顯得親切。他們這班人倘使擠在頭等車裏，衣冠堅齊的人握鼻子皺眉頭尚旦海鮮來不及，別說議他們坐，指點他們留心什麼了。然而在她們自已的天地裏，他們却肯給似乎不像同類的人以種種的便利，而旦還能出之以親和自然的態度。——這種平凡的人情味濃厚的事只有穿短衫褲的人才肯留心，換了那班穿長衫，著西裝的人便不屑去做了。</p>
<p>在憂患困苦中生長的人才能深切了解別人的憂患和困苦，受過了侮辱和迫害的人才能深切理會別人所受到的侮辱和迫害。——讓　座位之類雖然還談不上什麽了解不了解，只有一件長衫作幌子贏得他們些微關心也算不得什麽大不了，然而，他們的感情恐怕就生根在那種廣大的基　上，這僅是一點萌芽，一個雛型，一些皮面的表現而已！</p>
<p>想到這裏，我察察那輛電車已經在我的視野裹消失了。</p>
<p>我不禁茫然若失地爲地呆立了幾分締。</p>
<h3>尋風的人</h3>
<p>— 夏如</p>
<p>六月，暴虐的季節。焚燒，狗流着　沫。我找尋，羣風的聲音。×　×　×急急的，有如　取年輕時的心情，煽來了該然的風羣，　有迤長的量。帶着，焦渴的呻吟，轉灣抹角，那是嗡嗡的羣風人。×　×蝙蝠載來暮巴，樹葉也舞得輕盈了。沐着追得的凉風，我唱：「階石上，來啊！我尋到了晚風，坐下吧：辛勞的羣風人。」——你聽！</p>

<h3>U.S. Air Force in Okinawa Reorganized</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) - A dispatch from Okinawa reports: Rear Admiral Oz, commander of the Third Air Force of the U.S. Navy at the Okinawa base, stated the following when meeting with reporters on the 16th: "I have completed my mission as commander of tactical aviation in Okinawa. After the reorganization of the Okinawa Air Force, all army air force units at the Ryukyu base have been incorporated into the Far East Air Forces commanded by General Kenney. The combined air force of the Army, Navy, and Marines, which commanded the Tenth Army in the Okinawa campaign, has now been disbanded. During the reorganization of the Okinawa base, the Second Air Force of the Navy and Marines will be directly commanded by General Stilwell, while all other air force units in Okinawa will be under the jurisdiction of the Far East Air Forces. However, if the Eighth Air Force is stationed at the Okinawa base, it will be directly under the Pacific Strategic Air Command. General Spaatz's Pacific Strategic Air Command will operate independently, while General Kenney's units will only be tactical air forces."</p>
<h3>Chongqing Political Council to Close the Day After Tomorrow</h3>
<p>General Assemblies to be Held Today and Tomorrow</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 18th (Central News Agency) - According to a broadcast from Chongqing, the Chongqing Political Council continued to discuss proposals from various groups on the 17th. At the fourteenth meeting held at 3:00 PM, about 90 motions were passed, all related to international and domestic affairs. The fifteenth meeting will be held at 9:00 AM on the 18th, and various review committees will convene in the afternoon to review cases related to the National Assembly. General assemblies will be held in the morning and afternoon of the 19th and 20th, and the session is expected to close as scheduled on the 21st.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) - The British newspaper *The Observer* strongly criticized the Kuomintang regime in Chongqing on the 15th, stating that "a more profound issue than the CCP-KMT conflict is the constitutional implementation of the National Political Council. Progressive politicians and intellectuals, not to mention the business community, have criticized the National Political Council. The problem is whether the Kuomintang will continue its one-party rule. The representatives attending the National Assembly to draft the constitution were appointed by the Kuomintang seven years ago, so it is inappropriate to entrust such a special group to decide on the constitution. Therefore, democrats advocate postponing the National Assembly until peace is established and reconvening it after the representatives to the assembly are elected. Furthermore, the reason why Yan'an and the democrats do not attend the National Political Council is to avoid the Kuomintang unanimously passing politics that are nominally representative but far removed from the will of the people."</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen Returns to Chongqing</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) - According to information received here, Song Ziwen of the Chongqing Executive Yuan arrived in Chongqing yesterday with Petrov, the Soviet ambassador to Chongqing.

<h3>Large-Scale Underground Factories in Japan: Soldiers and Workers Diligently Producing Munitions</h3>
<p>A certain base in Japan, 18th (Central News Agency) - Since the enemy began their air offensive, their material warfare against the mainland has begun. The elite forces of the Japanese Army, Navy, and Air Force have completed all preparations to deal with enemy incursions into the mainland, concentrating all combat power, and fortifying various locations throughout the mainland. With special permission, a reporter had the opportunity to visit an underground factory built in a certain mountain range and was amazed by the rows of underground factories nestled in the valleys. At the foot of the mountains, rice paddies were just planted. The truck in which the reporter was riding passed through a dimly lit valley. According to Second Lieutenant E, who was guiding the way, excavation work was also underway underground at the locations the truck was passing through. Some factories had already begun operations, with a large number of soldiers and workers diligently producing munitions, including some female workers. Construction of a certain underground factory, which began in × month, is of a grand scale and progressing at an unbelievable speed. A large number of machines are being brought in day and night, and abundant hydroelectric power is being supplied even before operations begin. Skilled workers from coal mines, tunnel engineers from the National Railway Company, and university geologists are all working diligently, along with the enthusiastic labor of local residents. The large munitions factory is largely complete. Ten thousand soldiers and workers are pouring their efforts into producing new weapons. The entrance to the underground factory is only large enough for two people, to prevent the force of explosions. After going ×× meters deep, there are ×× large machines installed, lit by lights as bright as day. There are ×× such caves in the mountain range, as well as subcontracting factories and privately-run factories. When the reporter entered with Second Lieutenant E, young production soldiers and female students all saluted Second Lieutenant E, full of vigor, which greatly excited the reporter. In the future, no matter how the enemy launches new operations and deploys thousands of bombers to destroy Japanese production capacity, the underground munitions factories will continue to produce for the victory of the nation.</p>

<p>Travel Correspondence</p>
<h3>Observations in Western Zhejiang</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Tang Yi</p>
<p>The new head of the Zhejiang provincial government is eager to thoroughly understand the actual situation in the areas under his jurisdiction in order to decide on his policy guidelines. Thus, a Western Zhejiang inspection group was dispatched. The core of this inspection group was Chief of Staff Zhang Heng of the Pacification Headquarters, representing the Pacification Headquarters; Director Zhang Juansheng of the Civil Affairs Bureau, representing the provincial government; and also included Director Watanabe of the Liaison Department, Section Chief Pan Dingyuan of the Provincial Propaganda Section, and others. As Western Zhejiang has suffered repeated destruction and transportation has been cut off for a long time, this reporter felt that the true situation there was a matter of concern for readers, and therefore wished to accompany the group. I am grateful for the permission granted by the inspection group and for the care provided by Section Chief Pan along the way.</p>
<p>The destination of this inspection was Wuxing (Huzhou), formerly known throughout the country for its silk wealth, but now ravaged and with some people even eating grass roots. The New Fourth Army cut off transportation from Hangzhou to Wuxing long ago. Since the National Army troops under Xiang Zhizhuang were transferred to Zhejiang, the strength of the Zhejiang province has been greatly enhanced. Furthermore, the conflict between the CCP troops from Chongqing and the communist forces in Zhejiang was quite intense. Recently, the National Army, with the assistance of Allied forces, launched a large-scale mopping-up operation, recovering several towns and cities. The transportation between Hangzhou and Wuxing, which had been cut off for one or two years, has now been restored. At present, waterways have been reopened, though with fewer departures than before the war. Roads, however, have been severely damaged, with all the bridges destroyed. Minor damage has been repaired and can be used gradually, but the major bridges are still awaiting the efforts of the construction authorities due to material shortages.</p>
<h3>Tangqi</h3>
<p>Traveling along the canal from Hangzhou for two hours brings one to Tangqi. The town has a population of over 14,000 and produces fruit. The annual rice production only supplies the local area for three months of consumption. Currently, the price is over 500,000 yuan per picul. Half of the people rely on miscellaneous grains and corn for sustenance. Rice and grain are transported from Jiaxing and Wuxi. There are only over 300 stores in the local area, belonging to 30 trade associations. The market situation is extremely depressed. Since Governor Ding Mocun ordered the abolition of checkpoints, villagers have been returning in an endless stream, and prosperity can be expected in the future. In terms of education, there is one junior high school with 100 students, one central primary school, and seven or eight private primary schools, with a total of over 700 students. Chen Wen, the commander of the 36th Division stationed in the local area, is very enthusiastic about education, subsidizing each school teacher and staff member with three pecks of rice per month. Recently, because the troops themselves did not have enough rice, each person has been changed to a subsidy of one and a half pecks of rice and the remainder in corn flour.</p>
<h3>Deqing</h3>
<p>After Tangqi, comes Deqing County, which was occupied by the New Fourth Army as recently as this spring. The city was captured by the 36th Division on June 16 with the assistance of Allied forces. After the war, the scene was bleak, with a population of only over 20,000. Currently, it is being reorganized and restored. Schools are also being established. There is only a temporary school now, with dozens of students. They produce fruit, and most residents are farmers. There are only about 100 stores, mostly grain and grocery stores. That night, the inspection group stayed in Luoshe, a town north of Deqing.</p>
<h3>Linghu</h3>
<p>Linghu belongs to Wuxing County. There are 1,000 households on the street, with a population of 7,000 to 8,000. Most people make a living by raising fish and silkworms. After the Allied forces withdrew in 1943, it was under the control of guerrillas for a long time, and has been restored for less than two months. There is now a regiment of the 34th Division stationed there, requiring the town to supply the troops with seven or eight piculs of rice per month. There are over 200 stores in the town, with over 30 trade associations. There is regular boat transportation. Because the area is wealthy, even during the lean season after the war, only 20% of the population eats miscellaneous grains, while the rest still eat rice. The price of rice is over 500,000 yuan per picul, wheat 260,000 yuan per dan, salt 360 yuan per jin, flour 140,000 yuan per bag, white sugar 14,000 yuan per jin, soybean oil 6,400 yuan per jin, firewood 6,000 yuan per dan, candles 3,000 yuan each, and British brand cigarettes 1,000 yuan per ten. This is a rough estimate of the prices in Linghu.</p>
<h3>Wuxing</h3>
<p>Wuxing was very wealthy before the war, with a well-developed culture. The destruction after the war was extremely severe, and the New Fourth Army also stationed there for a time. Currently, the National Army's First Division, Thirty-Fourth Division, and security forces are stationed there, with 300 policemen, three water police detachments of over 100 men, and Allied forces stationed there. The defense is very strict.</p>
<p>The county is divided into ten districts. The county seat is the tenth district, with a population of 70,000. The east, south, west, and north gates are the first, second, eighth, and ninth districts, with a total population of 90,000. The third district, Nanxun, has 16,000 people. The fifth district, Linghu, and the sixth district, Shuanglin, were captured recently, so official population statistics are not yet available.</p>
<p>The area used to produce silk, but recently, due to transportation blockages, a shortage of seed sources, sluggish sales, and high costs, the economic capacity of the families involved is very weak, and most have stopped raising silkworms, leading to a sharp decline in the industry. Most of the silk weaving factories have been closed for the past two years, with only one-tenth of the pre-war factories still operating, greatly affecting people's livelihood. Currently, the operating factories are rice mills, ironworks, and flour mills. There are 1,700 stores.</p>
<p>Although the price of rice in Wuxing is also over 500,000 yuan per picul, it seems that because transportation is inconvenient and purchasing is difficult, the small people suffer unspeakable hardships. In the countryside, some people are using grass roots as food. The county originally had 1.57 million mu of farmland, but much of it is currently barren. The county's revenue is mainly from land tax, which only amounted to over 2 million yuan last year, resulting in a tight budget for the county government. This year, the system has been changed to collect in kind, and the situation is expected to improve.</p>
<p>Educational institutions: There is one provincial high school with 400 students, one private high school with 300 students, nine public primary schools, nine district primary schools, and four private primary schools, with over 7,000 students. In terms of student numbers, this is only one-tenth of the pre-war level. Before the war, there were twelve high schools. Teachers' salaries are very low, and most of them are women. The provincial government has drafted a new expansion plan to increase the number of classes to accommodate school-aged children who have dropped out of school.</p>
<p>In terms of health, there is one Gospel Hospital and one county hospital. Public organizations include the Chamber of Commerce, trade associations, the Cultural Association, and the Anqing Association.</p>
<p>Zhejiang is located on the front lines, and the environment is particularly complex. The suffering of the people is therefore particularly great. Their hope for governance is like waiting for rain clouds. Having seen the war-torn Western Zhejiang, I cannot help but pin endless hopes on Ding Mocun, who has resolutely taken on the task of reorganizing Zhejiang.</p>
<h3>U.S. Unemployment Problem Ultimately Cannot Be Solved</h3>
<p>A Major Economic Contradiction</p>
<p>Moscow, 18th (Central News Agency) - Soviet economist Rubinstein recently published an article in "War and the Working Class," discussing the labor problem in the United States: "Before the outbreak of this great war in 1940, the number of unemployed people in the United States had already reached over 9 million. The number of unemployed people after the war will be even larger. The unemployment problem in the United States is very serious even during the current war, and the number is increasing daily. Various military factories, shipyards, and automobile factories have already laid off countless employees. On the one hand, discharged soldiers seem to have no hope of finding employment in their own country. In fact, discharged soldiers should continue their previous occupations, but during their time in the military, others have already filled those positions, making it very difficult to return to work. This phenomenon can be described as a major contradiction in the U.S. economy."</p>
<h3>Fears of Food Shortages Said to Be Improving</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) - According to information received here, after taking office, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Anderson gave his first broadcast speech yesterday, stating that "the U.S. food shortage situation is unlikely to improve much throughout 1945. The amount of food that the American people can obtain will be 5% less than last year, and there is a danger of a significant shortage of essential foods in the coming months, such as meat, oil, sugar, milk, vegetables, etc."</p>
<h3>Belgian Parliament Resolves That the King Has No Executive Power</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 18th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Brussels, the Belgian House of Representatives voted last night by an overwhelming majority of 98 votes to 3 that King Leopold III cannot continue to perform constitutional duties unless both houses formally declare that his executive position has been restored. Prime Minister Achille Van Acker submitted the motion to the House of Representatives for resolution yesterday afternoon. After Acker read out the contents of King Leopold's letter to Prince Regent Charles and criticized it, the House of Representatives referred the motion to the Legislative Committee for review. It was then brought back to the House of Representatives and voted on. Before the formal discussion of the motion, most of the staff of the House of Representatives gathered in the reception room outside the chamber, waiting for Prime Minister Acker to announce the new cabinet lineup after the resignation of six Catholic ministers. Acker distributed the six vacant key positions among ten members of the Socialist Party, Communist Party, and Liberal Party. At that time, the Catholic Party members strongly opposed it. Then Acker began the parliamentary session by reading out the contents of Leopold's letter to Prince Charles and later criticizing it severely, stating that "the will of Leopold III as stated in the letter does not conform to the will of the people."</p>
<h3>New Agreement Signed Between the Soviet Union and Poland</h3>

<h3>Imposition of Rice as Tuition Fees Strictly Prohibited by the Ministry of Education to Avoid Affecting the Future of Education</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency) - With the second semester of the 34th academic year about to begin, schools at all levels in Nanjing are actively handling enrollment matters. According to the recent methods for collecting tuition and miscellaneous fees, schools will be collecting rice or rice substitutes based on the current rice price. Recently, the price of rice has reached a peak of over 400,000 yuan, and the general public is already finding it impossible to maintain their livelihood. If tuition fees are changed to rice, the number of students dropping out will inevitably increase sharply, greatly affecting the future of education. A reporter from the Central News Agency specifically inquired with the Ministry of Education about this, and received the following reply: "The matter of changing tuition fees to rice has occurred in some areas, and the Ministry has issued a general ban on it. The Ministry has not received any reports on whether schools in Nanjing and other places have such plans at present. However, according to the previous order, not only will such a phenomenon be absolutely unacceptable in all national schools under the Ministry's jurisdiction, but also local schools will not be allowed to openly use the collection of rice or rice substitutes as tuition fees. Once discovered, the Ministry will immediately prohibit it."</p>
<p>As a result, a new agreement was signed in Moscow on the 11th of this month, changing the regulations for the management of Polish railways stipulated during the war. All issues discussed between the two countries were agreed upon in a spirit of mutual understanding and friendship. The new agreement was signed by Soviet People's Commissar for Transport Kovalev and Polish Minister of Transport Rabanowski, representing their respective sides.</p>
<h3>U.S. Navy Personnel Awarded Medals by the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Central News Agency - According to TASS from Moscow, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union recently awarded Soviet certificates and medals to 190 U.S. Navy personnel, Naval Reserve personnel, Coast Guard personnel, and Coast Guard Reserve personnel for their outstanding military activities in ensuring the continuous supply of military supplies to northern Russia during the war against the common Soviet-American enemy, "Hitler's Germany."

<h3>German Financier Proposes German Reorganization Plan</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from London via TASS: According to a special correspondent for the "Daily Herald" of the British Military Headquarters in Germany, Alfred Hagenburg, a German financier who provided funds to Hitler before 1933, has now submitted a plan to the British military government for reorganizing the German economy. The special correspondent said that it is widely believed that this plan was drafted by Hagenburg at the request of the British authorities, and its content includes the reorganization of the entire German economy, which also warns the German people that if the standard of living is too low, Germany will inevitably become a communist country. Moreover, this plan also involves Germany's "bad fate" and expresses great regret for the current lack of "leaders" to guide the country's reorganization. An editorial commenting on the emergence of Hagenburg's plan in the newspaper stated: Hagenburg's name is not unfamiliar. At one time, he was the most prominent financier in Germany. He even subsidized Hitler with money before Hitler came to power. He also served as a minister in Hitler's first super cabinet. Although there is no evidence to prove that he reduced his enthusiasm for Nazi ideals before the German militarists were destroyed, Hagenburg has long been recognized as the sole symbol of Germany's worst forces. He professed to be a German industrialist, creating his latent power, and can be described as the engine behind the German militarists. Unexpectedly, today, not only are Hagenburg's opinions sought, but he is also openly allowed to speak freely, and can freely express his expert knowledge of financial and industrial issues without any restrictions, and to warn of the "red danger," as if Goebbels is still the Minister of Propaganda. It also discusses Germany's need for "leaders," believing that nothing is more necessary than a successor to the head of state. At the same time, when Hagenburg is allowed to speak, for some reason, trade unions are not allowed to speak. Although we are said to be too politically inclined in the new trade unions, Hagenburg can rant and rave about the threat of communism. Britain declared war on Germany in 1939, and Nazi Germany is our mortal enemy, so we must have a clear plan for Hagenburg and everything he represents, so that we can completely eliminate it.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Emergency Countermeasures for Enemy Air Raids</h3>
<p>In the past two days, some areas of this city have been bombed by enemy planes, and the residents have suffered greatly. Yesterday's editorial in this newspaper put forward several points on this matter, arousing the attention of the authorities and citizens. However, in view of the seriousness of the situation, we will further provide concrete suggestions as follows:</p>
<p>First of all, organized and unified rescue work for air raid refugees should be launched immediately. The Municipal Citizens' Welfare Association has an unshirkable responsibility to take the lead in civil society and assist the government and relevant authorities to promote it urgently. On the one hand, it should contact the public opinion circles and appeal to all sectors to donate and sing to relieve disasters. On the other hand, it should immediately promote practical relief work, such as: 　Establishing air raid refugee shelters;　Opening air raid emergency medical clinics;　Establishing air raid injury rescue teams;　Establishing public cemeteries for unclaimed and poor bombing victims;　Universally establishing air raid protection, communication, liaison and patrol teams to help the public maintain law and order. All such urgent matters should be based on the principle that the government supervises and cooperates, and the people's organizations manage themselves. Baojia and medical and pharmaceutical industries should automatically assist. The most important thing is:</p>
<p>First, the organization should be simple, in order to be realistic.</p>
<p>Second, the action should be agile, in order to go to work quickly.</p>
<p>Third, government and people should cooperate closely, and both sides should have absolute mutual trust for all air raid emergency needs.</p>
<p>Secondly, the evacuation work in this city must be accelerated. In the past, the evacuation committee has been slow in progress due to the difficulties encountered in transportation. Recently, considerable measures have been taken for transportation, and all sectors of the city urgently need to seize the opportunity to evacuate as soon as possible. In particular, the general charity organizations that have recently decided to implement forced evacuation have still not taken any action. In fact, the evacuation of charity organizations is not a problem at all. It is nothing more than some staff members who are nostalgic for Shanghai and are taking a wait-and-see attitude. I hope to launch a unified evacuation as soon as possible. Other schools, factories, etc., that can and must leave Shanghai, should leave Shanghai as soon as possible. At this emergency moment, the authorities should especially consider taking compulsory evacuation measures. Strict restrictions must be adopted as soon as possible for residents from other places who come to Shanghai. If everyone waits and hesitates again in this situation, in addition to the losses suffered by the relevant associations, manufacturers and individuals, it will also be a loss to the country and society. I sincerely hope that people with good intentions from all walks of life will come out and advocate and achieve the goal of thoroughly evacuating the population of this city as soon as possible.</p>
<p>In addition, this newspaper has pointed out in the past that during the air raids, there are no shortage of city merchants, profiteers and speculators who hoard essential living supplies and take advantage of the war to seek exorbitant profits. This kind of behavior, from the perspective of personal morality, is no different from "taking advantage of a fire to rob"; from the perspective of wartime law, it is even more of an act that disrupts the social economy and undermines wartime order. We hope that all sectors will take out the inherent moral concepts of the Chinese people in this critical moment. Even if everyone does not have to see righteousness and abandon profit, they should not take advantage of danger to make profits. The more difficult the situation, the more calm and law-abiding we are. On the other hand, we still hope that the relevant authorities will immediately implement strict monitoring of the market. Anyone who spreads rumors, manipulates the market, and takes the opportunity to raise prices should be severely punished. In fact, the prices of the past two days, due to the frenzy in the gold and stock markets, and the general public's tendency to speculate, have already contained the sharp momentum of fluctuations. Therefore, to prevent soaring prices, it is not only necessary to strictly guard against merchants hoarding and hoarding, but also to pay close attention to speculative activities in the gold and stock trading markets.</p>
<h3>Relief for the Unemployed and Relief for Those Out of School</h3>
<p>— Floating Cloud</p>
<p>The current situation in Shanghai, where life is oppressive and the people are struggling to survive, can be said to have reached an extreme. In terms of education, because tuition fees are expensive, most parents cannot afford it, and most poor children have dropped out of school. It is expected that the number of students in each school will decrease sharply in the autumn term compared to the previous semester. This serious problem is currently being paid exceptional attention by people with a passion for education. The cry of "rescuing those out of school" is constantly being sung in all aspects. This newspaper's scholarship movement is sparing no effort to appeal and expand the fundraising target. Most enthusiastic people are working together to help, and the results are expected to be satisfactory. Unemployed youths have received great support, but on the other side of society, there is an even more pitiful group than those out of school, and that is the unemployed masses. They are struggling on the line of life, waiting for people in society who sympathize with them to provide relief.</p>
<p>This newspaper's twelfth issue of the Shanghai Municipal Administration once raised the issue of the recent surge in the number of unemployed in Shanghai. According to the latest statistics released by the Employment Guidance Office of the Municipal Social Welfare Bureau on the number of job seekers and job openings, the number of job seekers in April increased daily compared with the index in February and March. On the contrary, the number of recruitment positions in April decreased day by day. This trend can reflect the surge in the number of unemployed in Shanghai. If the problem becomes more serious, social order will be greatly affected. We cannot ignore what will happen in the future.</p>
<p>During the war, the formation of unemployment panic is unavoidable. The reasons are nothing more than the high cost of living, the abnormal social environment, the control of wartime policies, the slow transportation of materials, and the severity of the economic crisis, etc., which make industrial, commercial and various industries gradually decline, or even limit to stagnation. The number of unemployed is also increasing accordingly. Analyzing the constituent members of the unemployed group, in general, they do not go beyond the following two sources: 　Employees abandoned by society: That is to say, personnel who have been laid off from various companies, firms or organizations. They originally had jobs, but were forced to become unemployed due to social depression or other special reasons. 　Young people looking for a way out in society: They are either graduates who have completed their school studies, or young people who have dropped out of school due to economic oppression. Most of them are eager to find a way out to solve the difficulties of life. However, the social environment created by the war, based on the above reasons, is still too much for the original workers, so how can there be room to accommodate these young people who have just come out of the thatched hut? Therefore, the slogan of "no way out" can be heard everywhere in the mouths of modern young people. In today's Chinese society, "talent" simply has no place to stand. The continuation of this phenomenon may sow a major crisis!</p>
<p>Examining the facts in all aspects of society, we can see the suffering and struggle of the unemployed. However, the road allowed by the environment is definitely not a bright future, but an extremely dangerous and distorted path. For example, speculation in the stock market, hoarding of goods, and single-gang brokerage fees. These difficult speculative and violent acts, because of their small capital and high profits, and easy trickery, have become the only way out in the hearts and eyes of the unemployed. The laid-off unemployed get a severance pay after being laid off, and then use it to engage in the above-mentioned business, trying to be lucky. Some unemployed youths even sell and borrow money, raise small amounts of money, and unite with other unemployed people to travel to various ports, specializing in single-fine transactions. The number of people is very large. Once they encounter unforeseen events and speculation fails, not only will their livelihood be cut off, but they will even be ruined. Taking risks, the consequences are even more unimaginable.</p>
<p>Although the unemployment problem is not yet serious, the crisis is latent and cannot be ignored by us. In order to be prepared, the authorities and people from all walks of life should pay attention to and study this unemployment problem, and coordinate countermeasures and relief methods to reduce the unemployment crisis. The group tries to put forward the following points based on its limited views, for the sake of discussion:</p>
<p>Implement evacuation work: The unemployed should register with the authorities. After investigation, the evacuation committee or the unemployment relief agency should immediately refer to the differences in the unemployed's origin, age, ability and family situation, and force them to evacuate to their original hometown or a suitable evacuation destination. In this way, the unemployed can get a proper home.</p>
<p>Promote rural construction: Under the wartime system, increasing production is the current urgent task. Improving agricultural production is an urgent matter, and it is even more of a prerequisite for solving the people's livelihood. This kind of rural construction requires a large number of strong and capable members to participate in the work and advocate vigorously. Among the unemployed, there are no shortage of intellectuals. The authorities may use them to train and organize them in a short period of time. Assign them to various parts of the inland to engage in practical rural construction work, such as the establishment of rural cooperatives, the improvement of agricultural technology, the adjustment of the rural economy, and the establishment of farmers' welfare undertakings, etc.; in addition, the promotion of rural sideline industries, wasteland reclamation, and product development, etc., can also select talents from the unemployed in society and give them the opportunity to serve the country. The benefits to the entire social organization are not small.</p>
<p>Support the proper development of industry and commerce; the cause of unemployment stems from the decline of industry and commerce. A part of the industrial and commercial employees are unfortunately laid off, mostly due to the economic downturn. Those who are laid off due to weak working ability account for a small number. In the future, the government should urgently ban improper organizations such as speculative profits, and give the greatest strength and maximum support to legitimate industrial and commercial gold industries with productive capacity, such as facilitating the provision of funds, materials, transportation, and motive power, so that individual economic organizations can restore stability, and the market will gradually return to the right track. The trend of layoffs will not grow, and useful talents will get proper protection and way out. In addition, the government should also vigorously promote and assist small industries, handicrafts and family industries, so that the unemployed can embark on the path of proper production, which not only meets the wartime production increase policy, but can also reduce the panic of unemployment to a considerable extent.</p>
<p>Government agencies should strive to implement talent politics: In the past, government agencies hired private individuals due to the leaders' use of private individuals, and improper use of personnel often affected administrative efficiency. Those who are aware of the situation believe that politics is not on the right track, which is not without reason. In the future, the government should give priority to talent in the use of personnel, and should give them considerable protection, so that they can work with peace of mind. Except for those with weak ability and poor performance, they should be laid off. No layoffs should be made without reason. At the same time, we must try our best to adopt a public examination system, select true talents, give them priority in employment, and assign them to various departments to take on work. Within the possible scope, special assistance should be given to unemployed young people who have ability or knowledge, so that they can do their best for the country and society, and reduce some unnecessary waste in society.</p>
<p>Promote national compulsory education: National education is the foundation of the country. My country's education has always been very backward. During the war, prices were high and the people's livelihood was declining. More and more poor children were dropping out of school. The way to remedy this is compulsory education. It is the most important measure. I think that at this critical moment for the country, national compulsory education should be promoted universally. If we can gather social forces to set up compulsory schools in Shanghai and other places, implement universal national education. In addition to the funding provided by the state and social donations, in terms of human resources, we may as well make full use of unemployed intellectuals to take on teaching positions. On the one hand, we can rescue children from school, and at the same time, we can solve the way out for a part of the unemployed.</p>
<p>Launch an unemployment relief movement. Most of the unemployed are wage earners. They are extremely poor on weekdays and have no savings at all. Once they suddenly lose their jobs, their lives become more threatened. It is even more difficult to find another job. It is inevitable to wait to die. Therefore, the relief of the unemployed depends on the enthusiastic support of powerful people in society, such as small-scale loans, hidden poverty relief funds, industrial and commercial loans, and poor disease loans, etc., to raise funds so that the unemployed can receive economic relief, which can solve the current difficulties, and even use it to make a living on their own. In addition, awards for academic research, collection and funding of industrial and commercial plans, and job placement, etc., can also be led by the government and social leaders to actively promote them. If an unemployment relief agency can be organized separately to integrate them, and to cooperate with all parties in society at any time, the effect will be considerable.</p>
<p>Finally, the borrower believes that the unemployment problem is of great and far-reaching importance to social security. How to prevent and relieve unemployment panic, I hope that powerful people in society will pay close attention to it, and I hope to take responsibility and advocate the suggestion of an unemployment relief movement. If the government authorities can unite enthusiastic people from all walks of life to organize an unemployment relief office or an unemployment relief committee, etc., specializing in the registration, investigation, research, design and implementation of relief work for the unemployed. To carry out planned and organized unemployment relief activities with the broad social forces, at least in the sense of social assistance, it is very contributory and exemplary.</p>

<h3>Enemy Aircraft Attack Shanghai Again, Three Shot Down; Secretary-General Luo Inspects Disaster Area in Eastern Shanghai</h3>
<p>Shanghai Japanese Army and Navy Anti-Aircraft Command announced at 2:00 PM on the 18th: Approximately 80 enemy B24 heavy bombers and P38/P51 fighter planes invaded the Shanghai area at noon on the 18th, bombing airfields around Shanghai. The results were three enemy aircraft shot down (one unconfirmed) and one destroyed. Our side suffered minor damage.</p>
<p>(Further News) Yesterday at noon, enemy American planes again raided Shanghai, causing hundreds of civilian deaths and injuries. Civilian houses were destroyed in a tragic scene. Local Baojia authorities dispatched personnel to assist military police and the Anti-Aircraft Headquarters in rescue efforts and convened emergency meetings to discuss relief measures.</p>
<h3>Civilian Casualties Urgently Need to be Claimed</h3>
<p>The Civil Air Defense Headquarters has gathered the bodies of those killed in the bombing the day before yesterday (the 17th) at the mortuary on Maohai Road. Families are required to claim the bodies by 2:00 PM this afternoon (the 19th). If unclaimed after the deadline, they will be placed in coffins and sent to Pushan Villa for burial. Regarding the injured, rescue team members dispatched by the Anti-Aircraft Headquarters on the scene transported them to various hospitals for emergency treatment. However, due to the limited bed capacity of each hospital, the hospital to which each injured person was sent could not be determined definitively on the spot, and their families could not be immediately notified. Therefore, families can call 12410 and transfer to extension 299 at the Anti-Aircraft Headquarters Rescue Department the next day to inquire, providing the location of the injury and the injured person's name, place of origin, and gender for verification.</p>
<h3>Secretary-General Luo Inspects Disaster Area</h3>
<p>The day before yesterday (the 17th), enemy American aircraft attacked Shanghai, indiscriminately bombing densely populated civilian areas in the northeastern district, resulting in over a thousand innocent civilian deaths and injuries. Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo of this city were deeply concerned about these victims. Secretary-General Luo, representing Mayor Zhou, along with Police Chief Kobayashi, Director Noguchi of the Anti-Aircraft Headquarters, and Section Chief Ikeda, personally visited the disaster area at 5:00 PM yesterday (the 18th). They first went to the Tilanqiao Police Sub-Bureau to hear reports from Sub-Bureau Chief Matsushita and Deputy Sub-Bureau Chief Zhang Yuanjing regarding the damage and detailed circumstances in the disaster area. They reported that the area is a civilian district with 150,000 residents, including 20,000 foreigners and 1,400 Jews. Enemy aircraft dropped bombs in 16 locations, with bomb weights ranging from 20 kg to 150 kg. The civilian death toll was 360 Chinese, with 703 injured. Only two Japanese were killed or injured, and 31 foreigners were killed or injured. Afterwards, Chief Kobayashi led the 4th Company of the Police Headquarters and the Tsukazaki Fire Department, gathering fire brigades from Yangshupu, Tilanqiao, and Hongkou to provide rescue and firefighting assistance. However, it was regrettable that the local naval garrison area Baojia self-defense corps did not respond as quickly as desired in the rescue efforts. The Jewish air defense team made every effort to mobilize. They hoped that officers number 1 and 2 who were injured or killed in the line of duty would be commended by the authorities. At that time, Japanese veterans organized defense groups to maintain local order, and the Japanese naval marine corps fire brigade also dispatched personnel to assist in firefighting. Secretary-General Luo and his party then proceeded to inspect various locations in the disaster area. Along the way, the scene of broken walls and homeless victims was extremely tragic, and Secretary-General Luo was deeply moved, extending his condolences. The inspection was completed at around 7:00 PM. It was also learned that local philanthropists were organizing donations for coffins to bury the dead and providing porridge and tea to maintain the temporary livelihood of the victims.</p>

At the same time, it is also adjusting personnel in various inspection districts to thoroughly strengthen inspection tasks. In addition, Yang Xiaoshan, an inspector from the First Inspection District, recently apprehended two major pickpocketing criminals without fear of hardship, and they were transferred to the Qian'ansi Sub-Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Police Officer Forcibly Extorts Civilian Property, Sentenced to 15 Years in Prison; Shanghai Branch of Special Court Renders Verdict Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Special Court of the National Government rendered a verdict yesterday (the 18th) on the case of Zheng Weide and others forcibly extorting civilian property. Zheng Weide was the director of the Second Section of the Yimiao Sub-Bureau of the City Police Bureau. On the night of March 18th of this year, a peddler named Ye Gengsheng invited seven friends, including Liu Jinmei, to gamble in the home of Dong Zhu at No. 20 Sipailou, Xiaodongmen, and draw commissions. This was discovered by Wang Jingchuan (at large), a patrol officer at the Fuyou Road Outpost of the sub-bureau, who saw it as an opportunity to seek illegal profits. He immediately telephoned Zheng Weide, who led police sergeant Geng Shuzhen, Chen Wenfu, police officers Yu Desheng, Chen Weimin, and Gao Ganru to Dong Zhu's home. Zheng Weide called out and opened the door, and everyone rushed in, ordering silence and using ropes to tie up the gamblers. They then seized gambling funds of 40,120 yuan and a deck of cards from the table and the gamblers. Subsequently, Wang Jingchuan extorted 50,000 yuan from each gambler as a condition for release. After the gamblers requested a settlement of 180,000 yuan, Zheng Weide ordered Zong Mao to take the police officers, gambling funds, and gambling paraphernalia back to the bureau first. Wang Jingchuan stayed behind to collect the money. On the 20th, Zheng Weide distributed 6,000 yuan each to Geng Shuzhen and Chen Wenfu, and 4,000 yuan each to Yu Desheng, Chen Weimin, and Gao Ganru. Ye Gengsheng reported the incident to the police bureau, which then requested the mayor of this city to submit an order to the National Government for trial by the court. The main text of the judgment is excerpted as follows:</p>
<h3>Main Text of the Judgment</h3>
<p>Zheng Weide, in a joint conspiracy to obtain illegal profits, used his authority to forcibly extort property from the people, is sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment, a fine of 100,000 yuan, and deprivation of civil rights for life. If he is unable to pay the fine, the fine amount will be converted into a term of labor service based on the ratio of the total fine amount to the number of days in six months. Geng Shuzhen, Chen Wenfu, Yu Desheng, Chen Weimin, and Gao Ganru, in a joint conspiracy to obtain illegal profits, used their authority to forcibly extort property from the people, are each sentenced to one year of imprisonment, a fine of 30,000 yuan, and deprivation of civil rights for life. If they are unable to pay the fine, the fine amount will be converted into a term of labor service based on the ratio of the total fine amount to the number of days in six months. The illegal profits of 220,120 yuan are to be confiscated.</p>
<h3>Illegal Entertainment Venues Strictly Banned</h3>
<p>The City Police Bureau, in view of the fact that entertainment venues operating in the guise of special industries often operate without licenses, has formulated inspection measures, ordering all sub-bureaus to thoroughly inspect and strictly ban unlicensed illegal venues, and report them to the general bureau for punishment. As for those with licenses whose business operations exceed the scope of the license or do not comply with the license regulations, they will also be punished uniformly.</p>

<h3>Silver and Money Industry Requests Central Reserve Bank to Release More Cash to Meet Legitimate Business Needs</h3>
<p>The banks and money houses in the silver and money industries in this city previously requested the Shanghai branch of the Central Reserve Bank to increase the issuance of cash by 20% based on the cash figures required for current accounts, special current accounts, other general deposit rights, and the expenses of the banks and money houses, as compiled by the two industry associations according to the interbank current account of June 19th, due to the urgent need for cash in business. After the Central Reserve Bank allowed the issuance, the cash position immediately became more relaxed, and some banks and money houses voluntarily relaxed the restrictions on cash withdrawals to more than 30%. It is now learned that the two industries, in view of the fact that the cash position should be further relaxed to allow banks and money houses to prudently develop further, avoid credit expansion, and eliminate the bad practice of discounting, have recently actively compiled and submitted to the Central Reserve Bank a request for further issuance of cash based on the figures for cash expenditures and storage expenditures of each bank and money house on June 14th, so as to fully meet the needs of business and normalcy. Those banks and money houses that have not reported will be granted the right to allocate cash when the time comes. It is heard that if the Central Reserve Bank approves the request, the cash position will become even more relaxed.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Suggests Prohibiting Discounting</h3>
<p>The Shanghai West Office of the City Chamber of Commerce has submitted a document to the City Chamber of Commerce for submission to the city government, requesting that the illegal practice of discounting in this city be strictly prohibited, and at the same time, it has proposed five measures: (1) Notify all merchants to use parallel-line banknotes for cash purchases as stipulated. (2) Each bank should issue a number of banknotes each day to be used as collateral for cash deposited in the clearing house on the same day to avoid forgery. (3) Citizens should use banknotes for all purchases of daily necessities, except for cash payments. (4) All general merchandise merchants should be strictly prohibited from refusing to accept banknotes under the pretext of requiring cash. (5) Merchants should require users of banknotes to show their residence permits with detailed numbers and addresses.</p>

<h3>Street Scene</h3>
<p>— Xiong Huanguang</p>
<p>The sky is like a wildfire set by naughty children. As the sun sets, the vendor stalls lining the asphalt road resemble those just salvaged from a fire, scattered and adorning this noisy street scene.</p>
<p>Almost all of them have been scattered from the City God Temple, Xuanmiao Temple, and Grand View Garden. Several streets of food stalls are operating without business licenses. Regardless of whether the food is cold or hot, they are like children who have lost their nannies, tears streaming down their faces, failing to arouse any appetite, wandering everywhere. Their customers are often sturdy men with large appetites. When a few long benches are full, the area in front of the food stall is already crowded with people and horses, with steam rising from the pot and heads jostling together. Three large bowls down the hatch! Two legs are ready to follow the hawkers in a big circle: Food stalls are where we exchange hard work, and they are the closest confidants on the food line of life.</p>
<p>Salty and sweet, coarse and fine, rice-cooked, noodle-beaten, in water, in oil; most are economical purchases, the cheapest prices. The bowls are rough, and the grease on the table is where the mud and sand kicked up by cars rest. This stained rag also has to take on a lot of chores, finally having to let diners wipe their greasy mouths and sweaty hands accustomed to pulling rickshaws.</p>
<p>Tense, noisy; familiar, lively, realistic: But this scene is ultimately too mundane. Hairy thighs and half-naked faces are too difficult to describe one by one. They spend all day in the heart of the sun; cars and electric buses, two legs weaving like shuttles; you can't tell their fatigue. You know they're sweating, but you don't know the surge of bitterness and hot tears in their hearts. Food stalls, you can't finish writing about them; scattered, scattered; even stalls selling used goods, small rice stalls; carrying on their backs, carrying on poles, shouting with baskets... There is no such great lens that can paste all these living beings into the minds of leisurely people.</p>
<p>Life has become tense! In addition to the empty spaces used to perform "tricks," even the alleyways for urinating and defecating have been turned into camps for survival. As long as the ground is covered with paper, dotted with a few long-unseen banknotes, it's another row, allowing any single passerby to trade with a few silver coins in their hands. On one side are fortune-telling and character-testing stalls, and on the other side, a vagabond's mouth and a declining pen are forever doomed!</p>
<p>At the corner of the road, under the green shade of the trees, are stored the spiritual food of the people—magazines and newspapers—but there are a few lazy young people, like exiled soldiers driven out of their occupations, mixing tens of thousands of black characters arranged by typesetters, exchanging a few thin rewards.</p>
<p>For many people, "clothing," "food," and "housing" have already contracted with "death," and the problem of "travel" is becoming increasingly difficult. The "sidewalk" has become a "Huarong Road" for survival, almost entirely occupied by vendors. Added to this are the air-raid shelters along the way, and the faces of the people coming and going are so strained. Then, the vendors of the "future" can be used as "fortresses," and this "street life fire line" can slightly alleviate the "fire" of the petty bourgeoisie?</p>
<h3>Floating Life Like a Dream</h3>
<p>— Mu Qun</p>
<p>Night has descended upon the earth, and I wander alone in this desolate wilderness, filled with endless sorrow; a thread of melancholy; I hold a heart of autumn.</p>
<p>Is that the murmuring stream by Maple Forest Bridge, or the chirping of insects in the depths of the Black Forest? My friend, do you know? The bright moon has already hung on the willow tips, and sweet dreams are permeating people's hearts! Yet, I have not returned!</p>
<p>The moon's light is gentle, is bright, allowing me to find my way in the darkness, it allows me to see the past life -- those desolate green tombstones.</p>
<p>Let us chant the poems of the medieval ages! This environment is intoxicating enough for a wanderer at the edge of the world. I meditate, I stand on a pile of rubble.</p>
<p>The surroundings are frighteningly desolate, the broken walls are quite striking, is it a sheer cliff? Is it a standing screen? Or is it a dilapidated fortress! And so I fantasize:</p>
<p>"Many years ago, this was once a paradise!</p>
<p>"Many years ago, this pile of tiles once held a tall building! Inside lived a group of noble people, and at this time, it must have been brightly lit, with music like a spring! Then, a trace of piano music floated from the balcony, matching the hushed whispers of pairs of lovers, weaving a web of happiness..."</p>
<p>However, time has passed, and this tall building has now become rubble, and the happy people are now drifting in foreign lands? Is this a dream of the Red Chamber? I am a little lost, and I fantasize even more!</p>
<p>"From a distant place, a steed gallops, carrying a hero of the medieval age, he jumps onto the pile of rubble, raises a torch, and shouts loudly, awakening all those who have died, they revel and sing loudly, turning this desolate wilderness into a paradise, countless happy people dance inside..."</p>
<p>This must be a very faint fantasy! Can't you see those haggard ghosts? This is a sadness! People will not understand me.</p>
<p>And so, I think even more about those decaying bones in the green grass, in the past they all had blood, flesh, and souls, perhaps a kind old man, perhaps an enthusiastic youth, perhaps a delicate young woman, perhaps an innocent child... My friend! You are not a pessimistic person, are you! But when you think of "floating life like a dream," will you not lose your ambition?</p>
<p>The night is deep! My heart is about to be shaken by the wind in this wilderness, and my body feels excessively tired, shouldn't I return yet?</p>
<h3>Favored</h3>
<p>— Cen Jia</p>
<p>Although the tram has abolished the third class, treating everyone equally, those wearing suits and ties always rush to the original first-class carriages first; while a group of vendors and laborers in short jackets, although paying the same fare, mostly still know their place and step onto the original third-class carriages, not daring to overstep their bounds. They probably understand very well: in a crowd of well-dressed gentlemen and ladies, if there is a roughly dressed commoner squeezed in, causing this one to frown and that one to hold their nose, the atmosphere would be too discordant, it is better to squeeze into the third-class carriage they are used to. Even if they accidentally bump into someone and start a fight, it is still better than squeezing in front and hearing our young ladies and grandmothers say in a strange voice, "How can you be like that, bumping into something?"</p>
<p>Although I don't particularly value my long gown, the magic of the long gown always occupies an important position in my subconscious. So whenever I take a tram, I always squeeze into the first-class carriage.</p>
<p>However, on this day, when I rushed to the tram station, although there was a tram stopped there, I saw that there were already many passengers in the front carriage, and there were still many people waiting to get on the platform. The trailer was still empty, and I calculated that time would not allow me to wait for a second tram, so I had to jump onto the trailer.</p>
<p>After jumping onto the trailer, I stood in front of a worker-like man who was sitting. The person sitting was not sitting tightly, and adding another person would not be too crowded. But because the weather was hot, and because I cherished my spun silk gown, I didn't want to sit. However, the worker-like man thought I was approaching to sit, and immediately asked the person next to him to move over a bit, leaving a seat. I felt it would be impolite to refuse, so I sat down as he wished. But before my body touched the chair, the man suddenly said:</p>
<p>"Lift up your gown a bit, be careful not to wrinkle it!" As if speaking casually, not at all affected. So I carefully looked at him, he was wearing a set of black foreign cloth short jacket and trousers, which were already very old, and some places were a bit torn. His wrinkled, dark face and limbs showed that he had experienced many vicissitudes of life. He wiped the sweat from his forehead from time to time.</p>
<p>In gratitude, I really wanted to talk to him, but I couldn't find the right words to say for a moment. We are used to speaking in a literary style, which sounds very logical and pleasing to our own ears; however, if we want to express a meaning, we often have to go around several bends, and by the time the sound comes out, it is already covered with heavy curtains. Using this kind of language to strike up a conversation with them, they would definitely feel out of place and unable to understand.</p>
<p>Until the tram reached its destination, I couldn't think of a word to say.</p>
<p>I finally stood up with a sense of apology, glanced at the man, and then walked towards the door.</p>
<p>Near the door, a person had his right leg resting on his left leg, his foot protruding very far, if I walked straight, my long gown would definitely be stained with dirt and phlegm from the bottom of his foot, I was about to avoid that foot to go out, when a person sitting next to the person who raised his thigh—he was wearing a set of yellowed white short jacket and trousers—but rushed to say:</p>
<p>"—Hey, you!"</p>
<p>While saying, he also reached out and gently patted the person's thigh. Then that leg immediately went down.</p>
<p>"—This is truly unique!"</p>
<p>I jumped off the tram, muttering to myself.</p>
<p>Giving up a seat, telling me not to wrinkle my gown, telling someone to put their foot down—these are all ordinary things. However, precisely because they are ordinary, they seem more intimate. If this group of people were squeezed into the first-class carriage, the well-dressed people would be too busy holding their noses and frowning, not to mention inviting them to sit down or telling them to be careful of anything. However, in their own world, they are willing to give people who do not seem to be of their kind all kinds of conveniences, and also do so with a kind and natural attitude. —This kind of strong ordinary human touch is only what people wearing short jackets and trousers are willing to pay attention to, if they were to change into long gowns and suits, they would disdain to do it.</p>
<p>People who grow up in suffering and hardship can deeply understand the suffering and hardship of others, and people who have suffered insults and persecution can deeply understand the insults and persecution suffered by others. —Giving up a seat or the like is not worth mentioning in terms of understanding or not, only a long gown used as a pretext to win their slight concern is nothing great, however, their feelings are probably rooted in that kind of broad foundation, this is just a seed, a prototype, some superficial expression!</p>
<p>Thinking of this, I realized that the tram had disappeared from my sight.</p>
<p>I couldn't help but stand there blankly for a few minutes.</p>
<h3>The Wind Seeker</h3>
<p>— Xia Ru</p>
<p>June, a season of tyranny. Burning, dogs drooling foam. I search, for the sound of the wind. × × × hastily, as if taking the mood of youth, fanning the promised winds, with a lingering measure. Carrying, the parched moans, twisting and turning, those are the buzzing wind seekers. × × Bats carry the evening, the leaves also dance lightly. Bathed in the pursued cool breeze, I sing: "On the stone steps, come! I have found the evening breeze, sit down: hardworking wind seeker." —Listen!</p>
