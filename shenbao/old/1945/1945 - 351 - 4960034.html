<h3>國大代表發表　對時局意見　認目前國是之解決途徑在還軍於國與還政於民</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿四日電〕國民大會代表，於民族復興節發表對時局共同意見，略謂：吾人認爲，當前國是之解決途徑，不外兩點，即還取於國與還政於民，軍隊爲捍衛國家，保護人民之工具，任何黨派不得據爲私有，必須還之國家，其理甚明，無庸贅述。政權爲全國民命所寄託，自應結束訓政，還之於民。今日國民政府行使政權，在理論上係根據國父孫中山先生之遺敎，而在法律上係依據二十年公布之「中華民國訓政時期的法」，前者規定由訓政以達憲政，爲我革命建國之最高原則，後者乃國民會議所賦與還政於民，應以依法召集之國民大會爲唯一之對象，而由國民大會正式組織民選政府，以行使治權。若此而外，國民政府實無任何私相授受之權力，蔣主席於本年三月一日憲政實施協進會上，曾鄭重宣示：「吾人祗能還政於全國民衆代表的國民大會，不能還政於各黨各派的黨派會議或其聯合政府」，言簡意深，實爲確切不移之眞理。</p>
<p>目前行將舉行之政治協商會議，在法律上本無根據，不過爲解決黨派糾紛之一種商談，使各黨派對國是之意見趨於一致，然國家大計，非依照法律規定之眞正民意機關無權議決。本屆國民大會代表，乃依法由人民選樂所產生，旣非各黨派所能愛憎，亦非政治協商會議所得變更，倘對此基本之大經大法信念不堅，樂措不定，則政府蘄求和平統一之苦心，無由達到，更予野心者以可乘之機，得寸進尺，必無止境。</p>
<p>本屆國民大會，爲我國賞施憲政之始基，而尅期召集，實爲解決國是之坦途，民主政制，法治爲先，任何黨派倘不堅守此現代國家憲政之常軌，一切咸以黨派利益置於人民利益之上，而不惜毀法亂紀，動搖國本，則禍亂相尋，不僅影響國際地位，抑且威脅世界和平。</p>
<h3>平津敵偽物資　儘量配售民衆</h3>

<h3>我首批藥材　已運抵新加坡</h3>

<h3>東北流通券與法幣比率將逐日掛牌　偽滿券及蘇軍票凖備清理</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿四日電〕關係方面消息，今後東北流通券與法幣將不定固定比率，而由中央銀行逐日掛牌，法幣持有者欲掉換流通券，須向中行申請辦理，一如購買外滙，此項措置，係避免資金大批轉移柬北，影響該區金融物價。前僞滿中央銀行鈔票及蘇聯軍用券，至相當時期，亦將予以收換淸理。法幣在東北之地位，目前因地而異，長春方面行營絕對禁止使用法幣，錦州方面則數量頗大法幣湧往流通，據聞該地法幣與滿幣之比率爲三此一。關於東北貨幣發行情形，據悉僞滿中央銀行發行額前爲八十萬萬元，日本投降後，僞滿政府爲發官員遺散費，增加發行四十萬萬元。蘇軍用券第一批數目爲十萬萬元，以後是否增發不詳，至國府發行東北流通券，目前爲數甚少，本月十三日運長五千萬，廿一日又運去五千萬，共一萬萬元。此種紛歧之現象，錦州中行開幕後，當可消滅。東北行政人員薪金數目，關係社會金融頗鉅，常局經數度之研討後，聞已定簡任官每月九千圓，如東北物價無大波動，此數差堪淸官養廉，東北物價甚低，今後如金融處理得常，社會必易安定。</p>
<p>〔中央社錦州廿四日電〕中央銀行運東北流通券來錦，廿三日已運到廿八箱，廿四日運到十四箱，俟籌備就緒，即可開始營業。</p>
<h3>北平至錦州全綫巡禮</h3>
<p>〔中央社錦州廿二日電〕北寗路暢通至錦州，北方人民在心理上旣獲保障，在經濟上又得以貨暢其流，恢復通商自由，北平通車錦州之翌日，記者自平登車來錦，作全綫視察，車行三日，車內有暖氣備，沿途有中美部隊妥爲保護，四千餘旅客，均以最愉快心情，安全抵達目的地。關內外一千一百九十二華里之鐵路交通，在最困難環境下，能於短期內迅速恢復，是誠爲勝利後最成功之表現。而此不能不有賴於盟軍國軍及農民心心相印之偉大合作，倘無共軍騷擾，恢復日夜行車，則行旅時間，當可减去一半。車自平站開行時，購錦州票者，極爲踴躍，客車達十五輛，平津車行迅速，按時抵達，天津唐山較長一百卅四公里，因路綫修復伊始，的行五小時始抵唐山，鐵路兩側設施，遭共軍破壞，尤其村莊情形，慘不忍覩。軍行抵唐山，係午後五時，旅客留宿唐山，換車前進，唐山客貨雲集，至顯繁榮，時値開灤煤礦公司移回天津，車站上慶祝情形，甚爲熱烈。開灤自始至終，從未停工，五萬工人在敵橋梁，均由美海眾陸戰隊設崗保護。美軍於零下七度在橋口處設帳篷守衛，其艱苦備嘗，每一旅客均極感動，故每當車過鐵橋時，旅客輒伸手軍外，高喊「頂好」。美兵亦含笑以「頂好」答之。北戴河附近廣野，有兩美兵就地修理電話，一中國兒童騎於一人覇據時，極盡保護產業之苦心，據云，每日可出煤九千五百噸，唐山人口廿萬，由國軍盟軍合力維持秩序，地方情形甚安定。唐山附近四十里，時有匪擾，但不足懼，日晨自唐山乘車東行，過古冶。昌黎。蘇縣。北戴河。秦皇島至山海關，沿途七十餘美兵肩上，二兒童席地而坐，注視修理電話情形，車窗遠眺，實爲一幅美麗圖畫，內心深爲感動。午後七時抵山海關，留宿山海關鎭，四周廢墟一片，共軍罪狀歷歷在目，七萬人口正在掙扎中苦度，刦後餘生，述及共軍拉兵槍掠情形，淚如雨下，對國軍拯救之情，尤其對國軍迂廻共軍向關上不發一彈之苦衷，不勝感激涕零。廿日晨換車出關，一百八十二公里費八小時始達，兩側森林平原，肥沃可愛，牛羣。羊羣，處處可見，日人所造之雙軌路綫，已半遷破壞，萬千晨工正在搶修中，沿途小村莊中，尙匿有共軍，但爲數甚少，車行數小站，均見有農民怒焚共軍之邊區鈔票，據吿，鄕間農民，蒙受此鈔票之苦者允衆，此一段路綫轉戰南北健兒，在零下十四度酷寒中嚴密保護爲國爲民之忠情，車中旅客無不深致崇敬。記者出關後，不斷聞有老百姓希望　蔣主席能蒞臨東北之呼聲，國人希治之殷，聲一求瞻仰　領袖豐采之熱情，洋溢於耳目，火車於夜色蒼茫中抵錦城，見有大批部隊開拔前方，三日疲憊，因此令人興奮之情景，遺忘殆盡矣。</p>

<p>籌建分四階段工作卒底於成　　〔中央社記者任玲遜倫敦廿三日電〔聯合國籌委會本日各項工作之完竣，足示聯合國組織之籌建，業已進抵最後一個階段。聯合國組織之籌建，百分爲四個階段：第一，即頓巴敦橡樹會議，當時中美英蘇四强對於此項世界組織之初步體系，得一般協議，並於本年度二月間雅爾達會議而得以證實。第二階段，由於本年五月廿七日所舉行之舊金山會議而底於成。常時聯合國憲章訂定，而籌備委員會成立。第三個階段係七週之後，於本年八月十六日伊始，籌委會之執委會舉行會議，執委會由澳國。巴西·加拿大·智利·中國·捷克·法國·伊朗·墨西哥·荷蘭·蘇聯·英國·美國及南斯拉夫十四國組成，經過九週之詳細討論，執委會通過一巨幅之報吿，其中包含聯合國組織各重要機構體制之籌組細則，此一報吿成爲籌委會討論之根據。霧委會自本年十一月廿四日開始工作，至本日午後結東，經過四週以上之檢討，籌委會所組之八個技術小組會對於執委會報吿各點，曾作澈底之考嗷，有提出修正者，有未加修正者，有全加駁斥者，惟泰半均經採納。參加執委會者僅十五國，而出席籌委會者達五十一國。</p>
<p>籌委會所作決議之大部最令人興奮者，厥爲獲得一致之贊同，即引起激辯之問題，諸如秘書處之籌組。託管制度之組織，永久地址之選取等，均得圓滿解決，此所以參加義委會全會之大部代表，咸認工作之迅速完成，誠爲佳兆，雅爾達會議舉行時，無人最預測此一世界組織於一年內得以有效工作。舊金山會議中，若干人士咸不信此五十一獨立國家在本年杪以前，對於組織細情能得協議。按照籌委會八個技術小組會最後報吿所作之總報吿，將於明年正月二十日遞呈大會，作最後之審核，其中並包括聯合國大會安全理事會。經濟社會理事會。託管理事會。以及聯合國各重要機構之籌組小組委員會之臨時細則及程序。此外並包括秘書處之組織及聯合國組織之特權問題所作之各項建議，以及行將由聯合國及美政府間對於美國境內設置聯合國「永久地址之特殊地位」所作協定之草案。籌委會最後報吿之序言中，寄予無限之希望，有謂設或籌委會完成工作之精神，能爲一般嚮導，則聯合國組織即可順利建立。設或聯合國組織於其初步措置中，能握住世界各隅之意，則一般寄以厚望之人士，以爲此一組織係使其本身及其後裔，擺脫戰爭桎梏之最後機會，不致失望。</p>
<h3>最後通過　兩小組報</h3>
<p>〔中央社倫敦廿三日電〕籌委會全體大會，本晨通過甲種技術小組（負責託管制理事會事宜）及丁種技術小組（負責聯合國全體大會事宜）所提出之最後報吿。甲種技術小組會主席挪代表提出報吿時稱，聯合國之軀穀現已完成，全體大會即可於明年一月十日舉行，討論重要工作，而母需遭受關於程序事宜屢次爭辯之阻攬。捷代表提議通過甲種技術小組之報吿時，讚頌五强之合作相助之態度，卒使甲種技術小組委會之工作。得爲偉大之成功。各代表對有關一切大小國家之各種決議時，均作積極具體之態度，執委會自八月迄十月止，所歷經之數重要爭論，刻均已由全體通過，或至少三分之二之多數票而議決，此實預兆聯合國全體大會之順利前進。丁種技術小組會之最後報吿，本晨亦獲通過，然荷比法國及南非四國代表，仍聲明保留於全體大會中再度討諭此報吿中所提出予託管地之居民權利自由之權利。</p>
<h3>英暹條約　日內可簽字</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿四日電〕英暹條約可於一二日內簽字，其性質介乎和平條約與停戰協定之間，至於最後之和平條約，須俟暹羅之選舉舉行以後始行簽訂。倫敦官方謂此一過渡條約，乃「協定之言」並將附以附錄，規定其範　及用意。該條約之最後條件，已由英暹代表同意，並悉均已接奉本國訓令準備簽字。又悉，暹羅政府在原則上已表示同意將食米輸往緬甸及馬來亞，惟數量如何，並未在條約上規定。在簽字以前，當亦未能決定，蓋目前之供應狀態，允須經英暹專家之審查也。美國國務院決定撤回反對簽字之要求，使倫敦感覺滿意，倫敦之觀察家認爲美國之疑惑，實係所接獲之「過時消息」所造成。</p>
<h3>韓國旅客談　蘇佔領區狀况</h3>
<p>〔合衆社漢城廿三日電〕今日來自蘇軍佔領區之旅客稱；在最近之反共暴動中，韓國共產份子與反共份子曾發生衝突，當時學生八名殞命。據此等旅客謂，在韓國東北部蘇軍佔領之漢亨？（譯音）日本婦孺每日有三十至五十人死亡。蘇方幾已將全部日本男十在漢亨之某區集中，運往西比利亞在煤礦與其他鑛區作强迫勞役。在蘇軍佔領區中，日人所獲之待遇不佳。在韓國北部東段，埋葬死屍之棺木不足，而以稻草米袋充用。此等難民帶來有關蘇方不顧民衆幸福之種種傳說，但蘇方旣拒絕美國記者進入其佔領區，故確吾無法證實。</p>

<h3>日軍事技術秘密　被美佔領軍鹵獲甚夥　搜索情報殆鉅細無遺</h3>

<p>〔中央社東京廿三日電〕麥帥副參謀長威洛貝中將稱，吾人於此間任務結東時，美政府將可獲得關於日本之大量情報，任何國家對另一國情况之情報，均不能及此數量，徵集組存檔之文件及報告達一千五百件以上，其他資料亦在搜集中，每週收集之資料達數百件，各調查組刻於日本各地進行調查工作，有關資料鉅細無遺。一一收入並有若干特別調查組織，繼之調查工作。彼等之努力，無疑將查明日本之戰時秘密，日木若干疑團，將因此逐一揭破。美調查人員進行之調查範圍廣泛，無所不包。僅枚舉數例即可說明調查對像之種類繁多，自住宅樹木食物飲食習慣以至政治情况，均在其列。即極具技術性之雷達噴氣推進機亦屬調查範圍。</p>

<p>富人狂歡</p>
<p>平民不免遜色</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿三日電〕世界已和平，英國人對於各國人士雖具善感，但其戰後第一個聖誕，就家族歡聚及兒童佳節言之，似不能恢復戰前標準。當有之家，已於十一月中旬預先定座，將由倫敦西端旅館餐肆供備，音樂跳舞竟夕在歡，惟普通人民多於七年來作目次團聚，其家庭狀况不免稍感困難，且有不能按照傳統習慣，備辦聖誕節夜燃燒之木柴煤斤者，其有親屬尙在海外，於役禾歸者，亦頗不少，兒童食糧問題，較前稍佳，聞南愛爾蘭有火鷄三十萬頭，巴勒斯坦海法有葡萄三百五十餘萬磅運抵英國。澳大利亞亦允大量增加供應鷄蛋，並將多運茶葉小麥鮮肉鹹肉火腿奶油椰子油糖車　酒及甜酒，聖誕節於食物之外，其次即爲禮物，</p>
<p>禮物玩具</p>
<p>劣貨供應市面</p>
<p>惟本年禮物較戰爭期內之六個圣誕節更稀，有幾家商店大部份依賴舊貨，一方面亟於賣出，一方亦急於買進，昔日最受歡迎之禮品，如手提袋手帕化粧用品匣及掛衣鈎等，均不易購取，即手套手帕亦須犧牲寳貴之配給券，時裝中心龐特街已遭炸彈殘破，雖仍可供應若干專有品，但其價値殊昂，一件舊首飾竟索價數千鎊之巨。某百貨商店設一專櫃，出售舊印刷品。舊地圖。舊航海圖及銅版印刷物等，價値自一鎊起，眞假珠寳飾物，視其價値及大小而異，最低僅値七先令六辦士。游戲用之紙牌殊不易購，兒童玩具亦甚難得，且價昂而貨劣，木製火車質地粗陋，繪漆不精，現皆陳列於各大百貨公司櫉窗中，若在昔時，此種低劣之物決不陳諸座上。有幾種玩具僅祗若干粗糙本片鬆鬆釘在一起而已。</p>
<h3>蘇聯在遠東　謀發展漁業　崴埠船塢趕造新船專家工人自西移東</h3>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科二十四日電〕蘇聯對日閃電政擊七天後，即佔薩哈林息南部與千島列島，並努力重行建設，今漁業已恢復並予擴張，工廠絡譯興建，港口便利亦見增加。來自蘇聯西部之蘇方專家與工人，紛紛移往該新地區，預定明年度蘇聯遠東漁業收穫將增一倍。當蘇軍進佔時，發現天然富源，已被竭力開設而不顧將來之損失，致千島列島中部與南部漁業之豐富性，已喪失不少。千島列島北部各島上最　大而完善之設備，已被美機轟毀頗多。在薩哈林島南部則因日軍撤退時取焦土政策，致所剩者一片瓦礫而已。蘇方傳前在千島列島北部與堪察加之日方大漁船，多數已被日人於撤退時取去，惟蘇方現已盡力恢復之，已有裏海與黑海區之蘇方技術人員及漁夫等之先遺隊數百人，到達千島列島與薩哈林島，而蘇方在遠東所建與漁業有關之工業現正加擴充，以應付此薪的需求。海參威等之船塢現正趕造新船，供捕魚之用。</p>
<h3>印度聯盟　昨召開緊急會議　指英國傳統政策未變　魏菲爾下月再晤廿地</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦二十四日電〕印度聯盟之中央印度委員勃蘭達里，昨在該聯盟召開之緊急會議中聲稱，必須將外國勢力完會逐出亞洲，亞洲始有和平之可言，聯盟秘書梅農之辭有謂，此次會議之召開，在表示吾人之忠于大會黨，及贊助印度之完全獨立。世界大戰並未將和平帶給印度及亞洲，如外國勢力不完全逐出亞洲，則和平永無實現之望。英國之所謂社會主義政府，仍不脫邱吉爾愛梅立時代之作風，最近工黨政府之聲明，足使印度局勢益趨惡化。梅農復謂，英國實無權逮捕印度國民軍人員，吾人堅決反對英人在印度之職權。</p>
<p>〔路透社加爾各答二十四日電〕印度總督魏菲爾勳爵或將在一月中旬以前，再度會見甘地於加爾各答。</p>
<h3>美各報批評　近衛回憶錄</h3>
<p>戰爭戎首不能辭咎</p>
<p>彼所記述誰能置信</p>
<p>〔聯合社舊金山廿三日電〕加利福尼亞州各報評論近衛文磨自殺，及其遣著回憶錄中所言，頗多訾議。麥克拉支系之蜂報社論稱，近衛服毒以前，曾提出最後抗議，調彼在三年首相任內力謀和平。就歷史觀之，其言殊難成立。欲明瞭日美戰爭前，日本國內混亂糾紛之局勢，固非數月數年不爲功。然其趨向戰爭之確定步驟，係在近衛任目相時所採取，則顯然可見。一九四一年十二月七日近衛雖已去職，惟炸彈早經製成，祇須有人燃着其火綫而已。侵華戰爭係近衛在任時發生，美國抗議爲近衛所直率拒絕。第三者調停中日戰爭之一切努力，亦爲近衛所打消。德義日三國軍事公約，又係近衛任苜相期內所簽訂。一九四〇年十月五日近衛且曾悍然預言，「美國若不了解日德義訂立同盟之眞意，爲績極合作以創建世界新秩序，則將引起對美戰爭，」此決非愛好和平者之言。試披覽一九三〇至一九四〇年日本歷史，不免使人發生一種印象，當近衛不在首相任內時，日本之軍事侵略，轉顯見弛緩。故近衛之目殺，似非因被控爲戰爭犯而於精神上感受絕大痛苦，殆自知一旦受鞠，且經歷史發表，縱不被認爲戰爭禍首，亦將被判爲日本戰犯罪魁之一。舊金山祀事報社評稱，近衛遺著中謂日外相松岡於簽訂日蘇中立條約時，已知德國有侵蘇計劃，實與事實不符。希特勒之侵蘇消息，使松岡自知受愚，近衛亦未嘗不知之，故留變數日，即行辭職。一九四〇年九月二十七日簽訂之三國同盟，應由近衛負責，一九四一年四月十三日彼與史達林之握手，同年六月二十二日希特勒之侵蘇，其負賣者應爲何人，日本人民自能知之。若謂松岡早知希特勒之意向而自投陷阱，其誰能信。且德國方面亦未必肯將其計劃吿知松岡，德國之輕視其柬方盟國，爲有目共覩。據美國駐日大使格魯謂曾一再令松岡駁斥德國故意欺騙日本之蹬據，松岡雖未公開出此，然或能使近衛信其所爲意在保衛日本地位。</p>

<h3>最可紀念的今日！</h3>
<p>今天，十二月二十五日，是狂歡的耶　節，狂歡之外，中國一般民衆却還印着兩個偉大的意義。</p>
<p>中華民國誕生於一個風雨　搖的時代。在宣佈民主政體不久之後，野心家袁世凱就想將這株新種在荆棘園裏的民主的幼樹，連根拔起，就在牠的根基裏，再種下帝制的刺　，期望他迅即漫延全園。可是，霹靂一聲，察松坡將軍在雲南舉起了義旗，獲得全國民主傾向的人士一致的響應，而高臥在新華宮裏的龍床上，正做着洪憲美夢的袁世凱，終於好夢易醒，御駕昇天，而這早產的帝制運動也就跟着他的御靈烟消製散了。所以，我們可以說，十二月二十五日是象徵着民主中國的奮鬥精神的日子。</p>
<p>此後，皖系直系率系各大軍閥逐鹿中原，四川福建各小軍閥互爭采邑，一塲大小軍閥混戰的局面，把老百姓陷於水深火熱之中。偉大的　蔣主席其時以黃埔軍校校長的地位，弔民伐罪。提仁義之師，　烏合之衆，把惡濁的黑暗勢力一掃而空。却引起了虎視　　的日本的嫉意，放下了　食式的經濟侵略的方式，進一步改採鯨呑式的軍事侵略，遂有萬寳山的動亂，北大營的突襲，而偌大東北河山，就在一夜之問變了顏色。蔣主席深知我國當時準備尙未充足，時機尙未成熟，只得暫時忍辱負重，理首苦幹，當時一般淺識之士，對於蔣主席的一片苦心孤詣，深謀遠慮，不但未能瞭解，反而無的放矢，輕舉妄動，終致　成了魯莽減裂的西安事變。</p>
<p>西安事變是民族興廢的一個重大關　。　主席赤手空拳，周旋於劍拔弩張的叛軍之間，生命危若累卵，而衛隊長蔣孝先以是殉職，參謀長錢大鈞以是受傷，情勢之危急，使全國上下驚惶不安，如受當學。以主席智謀之深，魄力之强，終於在這個可紀念的日子，安然出險。蔣主席大仁大勇的偉大人格，自經這次事變的試鍊之後，從此更顯光芒萬丈，贏得全國人民一致的崇敬與擁護。自蕭溝橋烽火初起，以至芷江日軍接治投降，經八年之抗戰，中國民氣能够保持國結一致，始終勿渝，主席處理西安事變之感召力，實在是一種主要的原動力。在蔣主席西安出險的第九年紀念日，讓我們向這位唯一偉大的領袖致最敬禮！（張德乾）</p>
<h3>冬暖夏涼的一塊勝地　海南島風光如舊　海陸空交通綱正在積極發展中</h3>

<p>從飛機塲到海口—海南島首邑—你會看到奇怪的景象，就是車輛在城外是靠左走，城內却已實施「向右走」的新規。這就是所謂漸變。海南島的道路很健全。這大概是因爲沒有重噸車輛行駛之故吧！敵人日本在過去數年中　意經營，妄想把海南島建成遠東最强固的海軍根據地，所以他們第一步就是整頓島上的交通綫。這周圍二百五十英里的孤島，交織着現代化的水泥公路，使重噸的軍用率可以在道裏來往搬運軍需品。</p>
<p>四大機塲　分據軍事要點</p>
<p>綿延修長的鐵道綱啣接島上各要點。在這圓形的島上兩大幹綫垂直交叉。島上還有四大機塲，分據軍事要點，設備堪稱完美</p>
<p>現在事過境遷，鐵路車輛大都在此次戰爭後遭受了損壞，煤斤已吿用罄，車站停車塲到處是頹垣殘壁。機車也因不用而生銹，全無生氣的站立着。鐵道寬度似乎也不合現代的需要。</p>
<p>汽油的恐慌，麻痹了大部份的公路交通。</p>
<p>海南島的繁榮，一向是倚靠進出口的物資。但是現在進口的船隻，杳無消息，原因是怕觸碰海面的水雷。船隻的缺少，當然也是重要原因。船舶的殘骸點綴着各處港口，目前旣無法打撈，又無從修理。</p>
<p>海上航運　瓊僑認係福音</p>
<p>要復蘇勝利的海南島，最重要的當然是商業的復興。同時，要恢復商業，必須先恢復交通，使海南島可以和外界接觸。目前海南島是處於半隔離的狀態。</p>
<p>先說海上交通：在戰前，海口對外的海運是很發達的，其時有定期的航輪，常川行駛華南大陸沿岸等港口，以及東京　，越南，新加坡，暹羅，菲律賓等地，旅客極爲稱便。及至日本侵入海口來了後，遂陷人停頓形熊，而現在，瓊崖是光復了，一切都呈現着新生的現象。旅居廣州灣的義民，亦都紛紛的買棹歸來。海口廣州灣問的航運，又恢復起來了，不過由於輸船的欠便，暫時只有帆船行駛，的每二三天行駛一次。至於速率，如果順水行卅，一帆風順的話，只須二十四小時便能抵達，來往的船費，約二三千元。聞現在正擬恢復香港，廣州等地航運中，這又是一般旅客的福音。</p>
<p>陸路交通　全綫千餘公里</p>
<p>其次，說到陸路交通，話又說回來了，我們瓊崖陸路交通，因各縣公路的完成，汽東交通頗稱發達，而海口亦成爲交通的出發點，土產，洋貨的集散　以此爲中心。至車之種類，有自動車，人力車，馬車，牛車等。統計全瓊環海縱橫路綫，一共二十三條，通車路程延貫一千四百七十四基羅，陸路父通之利便，可見一斑。其後復經一度修整，增設各縣村洛支綫，更稱利便，而値得我們汪意的，尤是從三亞建築至北黎一七五基羅長之鐵路，惟因缺少煤炭，極少通車，而現在敵人是投降了，交通本來是　利便的。不過，在西路方面，盜匪時有出沒，仍不能　　。東路比較安靖，汽車照當行駛，惟因現在行駛汽車不多，搭客又非常擁擠，每車差不多都有二十人左右，車側車蓬都立坐着人。車主只以綫爲目的，完全不顧到搭客的死活，現瓊崖當局對此，已有命令取締，以保搭客安全。至於　費，由海口至嘉積，已由七百元而漲至五千元了，這使一般搭客起了「有家歸不得」之感。</p>
<p>利用機塲　航空業務必榮</p>
<p>說到航空方面，從前有歐亞民機，從廣州經茂各至海口，及至日軍侵入後，將海口原有之機場，擴大數倍。文昌，臨高，嘉積，昌江及三亞等地，亦增設機場，其中以海口機場最大，三亞次之，設備亦頗完善，目前尙無民航機飛航。我們預料上述機場一旦加以利用後，航空事業上當即順利發展。</p>
<p>瓊崖的海·陸·空·交通·大概如上所述，目前雖然欠「便」但來日可因陸綫機塲的增加，而益趨繁榮與利便，那是毫無疑義的。</p>
<p>主要的出口貨，是水菓。花生汕·糖·和咖啡，進口貨則以米和製造品爲大宗。島上產米很少，向來仰給于法　越南。目前交通斷絕，在外人的印象中，島民彷彿全是以賣香蕉度日的小販。</p>
<p>藍海黃沙　一片熱帶風光</p>
<p>海口市似乎蟄伏在熱帶的日光下，樹木繁茂，棕樹在微風下擺動，充分表示然帶的風光。蔚藍的海水，冲刷着黃沙的海岸，湧出白色的泡沫。</p>
<p>島上的商業範圍極小，僅以本島爲限。路上的汽車，爲數寥寥。生活程度也很低。但是表面上，島民似乎對于他們的生涯很滿足。</p>
<p>島上生活，的確極爲靜穆安寧。路角上，設立着許多小咖啡館。一杯牛奶咖啡，售價法幣廿五元。光顧這些咖啡館的，大都是赤脚的女子，她們勞動回來，坐着談天，休息。島上現暫時實施戒嚴，每晚十時後，不准通行。街頭密佈着武裝步哨。</p>
<p>法國色彩　佔　全城優勢</p>
<p>這裏的建築物深染着法國色彩。新的建築物大都馬日本式，雖然日人已有不少被拘入郊外的集中營，但街上仍可不時見到男男女女的日本人。最先遣送回籍的，大概是被敵人强徵來的一萬五千名華工。</p>
<p>天主敎在島上佔着絕大的優勢。矗立城內的宏偉淸潔的紅十字會醫院，和許多小學校，都是天主教的成績。海關公署是島上最新式的建築，構造得相當精緻。</p>
<p>空襲的損書，限子港口和飛機場等建築。海口城內，已經看不出過去空襲的遺痕。</p>
<p>島上的食糧問題，自前尙不十分嚴重，米糧存底漸漸稀薄，每祖的法幣二萬五千元。當局現正致力復興救濟工作。委員長和國父的照像到處可見。</p>
<p>在過去，本島的燃料，在日軍投降後所存煤斤，現在已經用　，當力亦已吿竭。所幸的是島上有豐當的森林。燃料問題當可不成問題。在目前，大部的島民都採用油燈。</p>
<p>避寒勝域　不久可望實現</p>
<p>島民受着蛇疫的威脅，但在同時，蛇却是菜盤裏當做一種佳餚的。其他的山珍海味，是灼狗肉和海蜇，其味頗似花生醬。</p>
<p>這兒是一個冬暖夏凉的佳境，在冬天，即以目前十二月而說，氣候也只在華氏七十五度，令人感到相當的溫和舒服，絕對沒有所謂寒浪的侵襲。</p>
<p>在不久的將來，我想，海南島可能會變成理想中的我國避寒的勝域。（黎明）</p>
<h3>美軍在東京　本報編譯室譯自十二月號生活雜誌</h3>
<p>勤勞的日本人民，已將日本被炸城市中災區最廣的東京市內廢墟瓦礫，掃除一淸。各種車輛，也早在一部份未被炸毀的現代化都市中心區街道上恢復行駛了。日本議會，籌備在舉行臨時普選會議時，在東京召集有選舉權之女性二千一百萬人，她們都是初次獲得選舉權的一羣。本土駐軍三百萬人，除掉少數沒有勛章的聯絡部隊外，已經全部復員。國外的日軍總數，還有六百萬。麥克阿瑟統帥借撥坦克登陸用船一百艘與日本，每月可遺送日軍十萬人回國。日本的徵兵制已被麥帥下令撤銷，麥帥同時更查獲了兩萬五千萬美元的一筆鉅款，這筆款子，是陸海軍部隱瞞了政府而私自　過的，富士山上日本的遊客，已經有五年沒有上去過，可是現在呢，美國的花旗，也在牠的頂巔上飄揚起來啦。</p>
<p>神道主義現況</p>
<p>沒有受戰時犧牲的人很多，因爲他們始終和日本內地發生接觸，他們有些是到內地去躱避滿炸的。本年冬季，還有許多人可以荀延殘喘，他們可以往鄕下跑，那邊的食糧，比都市內要充裕得多。</p>
<p>日本現在是被擊敗了，而且正被一個美國軍官嚴格地統治着，但日本人如終還是和以前一般，並沒有什麼兩樣。麥帥已把日本的神逍主義廢除，無論是在學校，政府神社內，一概不准存在。祇有有關個人或家庭方面的神這敎，才不致受到干涉。日本人至今仍向他們的神道天帝和神社，行着鞠躬禮。可是某日本　法學專家，却作着令人該異的宣吿說：「日島本人，並不相信他是神道教內太陽神的後裔。」</p>
<p>曾經掀起宮韓革命，反抗軍閥集團的日皇，現在並沒有得到什麼利益。他的私產，據估計，達一萬萬元，還有地產三百二十萬英畝，如今已和六十七個男女皇族的資產，同時遭受凍結。現在，他年支四十萬元的預算，要經過美國人的詳細計核。日本的賠償額，可能達到三百三十萬萬元，他個人也許要負一部份賠款支付責任，可是日本的歲收，祗及到這筆鉅數的百分之一。</p>
<p>日警生活改觀</p>
<p>在東京，最顯著而有意義的，是警察職位的改革。日本的警察們，一向用恐怖的手段統治着人民。日本的警察，對於要逮捕的人，祗消命令他怎採走，怎樣轉灣，怎樣自動地跟着跑，被捕的人，也往往唯命是聽。日本人向警士們問路時，總是鞠躬如議，到如今，他們還是這樣，上星期美國反諜報部的長官，尖銳地指斥日本警察，不應採取恐怖方法和不法的充公行爲。在美人目中看來，日本警察的行爲，同時證明他們的無禮，丟臉，和不道德</p>
<p>婦女與巧克力</p>
<p>美軍士兵要在東京解決他們的女人問題，比任何地方都容易，逍個問題，時常可在皇宮禁苑隔壁的日比野公園內順利解決，可作爲對　的女人，旣非司空見慣的藝妓，又非俯拾即是的下女或娼婦，却都是脫離家庭管束的人家婦女，其例行工作，便是敎她們一些必要的英語，給她們一些吃的東西，好像巧克力糖和水果等東西，就足够對付了。到目前爲止，日本男子們，對於這種行徑，還有憤怒的表示。</p>
<p>美國政府規定美金日圓兌換率的失策，使美軍士兵們，瀕於個人破產的境地。美軍士兵的薪餉，是按照規定車十五作一發給的（即一塊日圓等於六分半美金）可是，黑市兌換率，因四個月來日幣通貨從兩百七十萬萬膨漲到四百四十萬萬圓的緣故，一元美金，的可換得七十日圖，一個美兵消磨一個沒有酒的夜生活，需要廿元美金。</p>
<p>美國新舞盛行</p>
<p>軍隊裏的人，可以免費旅行，可以在美軍所辦的百貨商店內購買紀念品。他們最佳的財產是紙烟，如果可以通過憲兵的干涉的話，每包紙烟，可換取美金兩元。日本的妓院，有一部份准許存在。東京的舞女們，已學會了美國的新式舞。（Jitterbug）但她們鬧着要罷工，她們說：她們跳新式舞的代價，僅僅一碟甜山芋是不够的。艾却爾勃虬將軍爲解決美軍的娛樂問題，已計劃一個浩大的運動節目，包括棒球。足球。滑氷和曲棒球。</p>
<p>東京冬景一瞥</p>
<p>東京有廿五萬人住着茅房陋屋，有成千累萬的人，還無屋可住，他們都睡在公園裏，本年冬季，米糧也惑不足。黑市已漲到四元兩毛半美金一磅。（戰前兌換率計算），一九四一年的米價，是每磅四分美金。日本官方宣稱：將有八百萬人凍餓而死，美國當局認爲此數未免誇張，可是死亡率之高，是勢所必然的。</p>
<p>爲支付食糧的進口，日皇裕仁計劃着將他價値四百萬美元的珍珠寳藏拍賣掉，美國强迫着日人將可耕的土地重新分配一下，把日本三分之一的無主耕地，售給佃農們耕耘。雖說這種辦法可以對將來的財富分配有所協助，可是本年冬季內，實在沒有財富可資分肥。飛機轟炸結果，日本的大工業祗殘賸百分之廿五，失業人數，的有一千萬人！</p>
<p>在這些情形之下，民間的不滿和缺乏休養，是難於避免的。日本的三十六個政黨內，最有組織和最有條理的，要算蕞爾的共產黨了。日本的共黨，和莫斯科並無關係，這是日本唯一要求廢置日皇的政黨。雖然如此，他們仍需要從傳統上自謀解放，因爲某一女性共戴份子在表示她對日　的意見時，她還流着淚呢。</p>
<p>睡在公國條凳上的流浪者，他們正在過乞丐和小偸生活。</p>
<p>復員後的日軍參謁東京神社時，美軍派兵站崗，禁止美軍行近。</p>
<p>日比野公園內，美兵和日本婦女在湖濱喁喁坐談，遠眺對面，便是麥帥總部的巨厦。</p>
<p>美國婦女學習工業設計打樣</p>
<p>美國在戰前，家庭用傢俱及設備，大抵均由男十設計打樣，現時婦女從事此新興工業設計打樣業者日衆。</p>
<p>圖示：美國婦女在支加哥美專學校工業設計打樣部實習情形。該校於過去四年中，訓練女生人數之增加率，已超過百分之七十五以上。學生在打樣部先受簡單之美術莫樣訓練逐漸學習正式作業。圖中女生，正用鐵鑽子裝　椅上把手之一部。</p>
<h3>亞洲工業化根據地　東北之新發展</h3>
<p>日本在東北所建立的工業帝國將由中國承受下來了。這一宗產業當算爲日本侵佔中國應使賠償的一部分，同時也足以爲中國開始工業化打開一個機會。東北工業曾有日本數十萬萬元投資。此刻鋼鎭，化學，機械，人造汽油，木材等工業，都並沒有遭受戰重破坯。這次中國接收無須償付日本所有主任何代價，因爲工業的所有權大部分原都在日本政府經營的公司乎裏。東北產業轉移的情形，美國十分注意，原因如左：</p>
<p>中國接收東北工業以後，日本人所辦的經理工作一定轉入華人之手，因此也許美國的經理人員與工程師將應召協助經營。同時，不論是經營或山中國轉讓給任何個人或公司如何籌措經費，也是一個問題，也許中國將布望美國投資。再說，這一新工業的生產品的市塲，是一個基本問題，也許美國的經濟家將應聘爲中國設計東北工業生財的最好辦法。</p>
<p>這裏有一個相當復雜的因素。蘇聯對南滿鐵路享有一半主權（按中蘇條約規定長春鐵路歸由中蘇合營），它也許對產權路局所有的東北工業要求分佔所有權。路局會辦有礦塲，工廠航務，電話，電報等許多產業。東北的工業當能謹愼地發展。（美新譯）</p>
<p>社論</p>
<h3>日本民主化的陰影</h3>
<p>麥克阿瑟元帥以盟軍最高統帥佔領日本以來，爲時僅三月有餘，以沈着的姿態，對處理戰後日本的措施，逐漸展開。如戰犯的分批逮捕，財　的解體，日本個農關係的改善，以及神道教與國體的分離等等，或是直接有關戰爭責任的淸算，或爲民主的新日本奠下了良好的基礎。在這樣短的時期內，而有如此成績，我們不能不深佩麥帥才能的卓越。日昨聯合社及合衆社從東京傳來消息，謂麥帥總部宣稱，建設新日本之基礎工作業已完成，日本古老之封建機構已告剷除。這報告是否可靠，不無問題，若使眞有其事，也頂多只能認爲麥帥總部的一個非官式的觀測。在日本民主化的過程中，目前代表日本封建制度最高機構的皇室還依舊存在，我們自不能因日本個農關係的改善，財閥的解體，乃至神道敎與國體的分離，而遽認爲「日本古老之封建機構已吿剷除。」因爲日本的皇室是日本封建制度的中心；皇皇未除，豈可謂封建機構已吿劃除？</p>
<p>關於日本皇室的存廢問題，目今意志似未一致。對日本問題有資格的觀察家，或王張廢，或主張存，自然各有理由。大抵英國方而保守人士一般意向，多認爲日本皇室爲人民崇敬的中心，事實上僅是傀儡，並不直接參與政治，應予保留，俾可以皇室爲中心，遂漸建立民主體制。這原是英國「現實主魏者」的看法。他們以爲日本皇室一朝廢止，全煙或將入於無政府的狀熊。這一種論調，在美國方面似乎也頗有力。可是在英國在美國，同時也根有一部分人主張日本皇室應即廢止，在民主的新日本次不容許有皇皇的存在。中國一般的意向，都認爲日本皇室應予廢止；雖然中國政府對日本皇室的存廢問題，到今天爲止。從來沒有發表過官式的聲明。</p>
<p>目下對於處理日本皇室的問題，停滯在這樣一個階段。波茨頓宜言裏沒有明白提到日本皇窒問題；日本在接納波茨頓宜言時會提出條件，要求保留皇室；但杜魯門總統的答書裏面，亦沒有接受日本的條件，僅言日本的皇室須受盟軍最高統帥的節制。主要盟國在處理日本皇窒問題上，只有消極性的一致，還沒有積極性的協調。這事實在不應這樣拖延下去！</p>
<p>我們認爲在日本民主化的過程中，皇室制度必須消滅，不能讓其再行存在。雖據東京電稱，麥帥總部高級官員暗示，設或日皇能獨具慧眼，設法解決米荒及失業問題，並遵循麥帥所施諸日本之民主體制，使日人獲得合理完善之政府，則日皇及其制度可得保持永久，並且日皇裕仁本人盼將遜位一事取決於日本人民，但日本皇室的存廢，而今已不僅僅是一個日本的內政問題，可以　日本人民自己決定，而是一個國際問題，應該由聯合國出來決定。我們不宜健忘！須知東條近衛都是拜受了皇皇的「大命」而組織政府的，從法理上講，日本皇皇是這次侵略戰中最大的戰犯，無論就侵華說，或就英美說，都應該負發動第二次世界大戰的全責。如今戰事終了，我們首當劃除這不僅貽害日本人民而且破壞世界和平的萬惡制度。日本皇室，與英國的王室，原是兩種根本不同的體制。英國政府的產生決定於民意，國王不負實際組織政府的責任。但日本的東條近衛之出來組織政府，並不是由於國會的支持，而是拜受了「大命」，况且陸海軍部又直接聽受日皇的命令，內閣對它們無權過問，故日皇對政治是直接負責的，我們不能將日皇英王視同一例。日本皇室是這次戰爭的最高指揮者。不問中國政府目前的意向如何，中國人民有權指陳日本皇室爲日本戰犯的首魁，並要求在戰後新日本的建設中皇窒制度應予廢止。</p>
<p>從聯合國的立塲來說，發動了中美英蘇的四國之力，將敵寇打倒了，若讓皇室制度依然存在，徒爲將來種着禍根。日本人民的心理中，向來存留着極深的神道迷信，以爲他們是神的選民，他們負有統治世界的神聖使命，就是爲了這種使命，他們發動了「大東亞戰爭」。他們自詡的「大束亞戰爭」雖然遭到擊潰，但若令皇室制度存在，可使日本人民有一種錯覺，以爲他們「神聖的使命」僅一時受些頓挫，還有待於將來的完成。集中美英蘇四國之力，而尙不能將皇室制度剷除，將使日本人民更加相信他們的皇室之「受命於天」，增加共自大在，而重爲世界的禍祟。麥帥將日本的神道敎與國體分離，原是極明智的措施，但如神道敎信衆中的「神」依舊讓它存在，讓它做日本政治上的統治者，則今後的日本恐仍將不是民主的日本，而依然爲一「神」主的日本，「八紘一宇」的天皇的日本。這實在足爲世界和平的隱憂！</p>
<p>爲世界持久和平計，爲日本人民利益計，皇窒制度的存在，終是日本民主化的一個陰影。我們應該廓淸這個陰影，然後世界及日本才能獲得光明。</p>

<h3>買戶接踵而來　金市漲風再熾　美鈔亦逐步上升</h3>
<p>烚赤昨人心續俏，美鈔在廠商及進口商大量扒結下，遂步上昇，刺激金市，證券帮中頗多脫股購金者，逐漸迫成軋空局面，自晨初七六萬八後，買戶接踵而來，求過於供下，午刻已穿出八〇萬大關，最後盤旋於八一萬左右，較上週六漲起五萬二，一般輿論對外匯率主張不應過高（市價以下），一般人心亦頓改舊觀，以致黃金美鈔需求更殷，前途恐將盤好，銀樓飾金掛八萬六，紋銀六百元，銀元仍在四五〇元左右盤旋，暗拆需求雖殷，但供源亦湧，仍站住八分至一角間。</p>
<p>美鈔因陪都行市轉堅，加之傳聞自由商輪今晨進口者極多，紗廠帮及進口商爭先扒結下，籌碼因而顯見枯竭，自晨開一二八〇元低價，愈盤愈好，迨穿出一三〇〇元大關後，情勢愈見堅定，廠方需求更湧，業中人被迫頗多趁高拋出者，於是午刻紛紛補進，午後更形俏利，最後一三八〇元之價尙多需求，較上週六漲起一百二十餘元，港票亦隨之而穩，結果老貨好五元，新貨升三元</p>
<h3>華股銳氣已減　公債漸趨下游　外股漲風仍未息</h3>
<p>公債因業中人興趣轉向股票，拉　乏人，丙種上塲即破入七百元內，繼而盤跌至六五〇元以下，散戶尙圖一逞，中途雖有拉上，但未能重出七百元大關，午刻仍因浮多脫手，降至六四〇元左右，結果較上週六續降五十五元至九十元不等，雜牌差價因而軋近，市况殊爲平淡。</p>
<p>華股初以前日證券公會開會幷不順利，人心稍感失望，大戶頗多脫股換金者，形成供過於求之態，紗廠自七四〇元退至六九〇元，美亞自五七〇元退至四八〇元內，入後金市漲勢有所刺激，證券帮大戶仍來吸收，最後復見回　至五百元及七百元大關外，形勢尙堅，但籌碼未見十分緊臻，（試觀本月十五日紗廠對黃金比價爲一千五百餘股，今晨祗需一千股略强），結果較之上週六計巨型股紗廠微升美亞略挫，小型股新光平景福勸興各漲一元半，冷門老股仍在實力派搜購下，飛漲不已。</p>
<p>外股熱門尙稱穩健，求供相埓，全市盤旋而已，客帮及證劵帮逢低仍有納胃，結果怡和再漲一百元，怡啤及紙業均昇三十元，其餘冷門各股稍見遜色。</p>
<p>紗綫隨金價上升</p>
<p>昨日紗市尙稱平穩，因金價頻頻報高，致各種紗綫隨之升起一萬元之譜，雖川帮對二十支特雙馬金鷄等老牌重磅貨頗有進胃，漲至六十五萬，然其餘二十支各牌紗綫兜售有人，成交不多，十六支紗同行買賣尙不寂寞，人心未見十分榮欣，脚地似未見穩固。</p>
<h3>白煤塊又騰漲　柴炭行市參差</h3>
<p>白煤節塊，納胃頗盛，重見高翔，白煤屑煤球廠方將獲平價配給，納胃轉呆，價略趨疲，烟煤屑交易閑散，行情平軟，柴船到埠較前爲少，價略堅穩，炭到貨仍湧，市似微挫。</p>
<p>昨日同盟輪，由天津裝來煤斤七百噸外，又有中山號貨輪，係美國總統輪船公司經理，自秦皇島裝來九千噸，昨日下午三時許抵滬，停泊浦東藍烟囪碼頭。</p>
<h3>米跌油漲</h3>
<p>黃豆生仁豆餅均俏</p>
<p>米市消化淸淡，粳秈平均疲二三百元，白元以丹陽來貨裝運抵申三五百包，河下輪運到申亦有二三百包，靑島帮暫停，市形回小六七百元，麵粉北洋去化甚旺，再升二百餘元，形勢趨挺，油市以甬帮舟山續進，依然挺秀，再升數百至千元，本街因平油關係，仍然清懈，黃豆閩。浙進胃仍續，價再漲三四百元，後情仍堅，生仁冬季本街另銷轉殷，供不應求，再漲一二千元，豆餅台灣去化接續，汕頭動辦異常俏俐，續漲二百元，酒市店方納胃亦佳，見升五百元，勢成疲而轉挺</p>

<p>徐州金針菜因產量不多，市似略升，而福建廣東銷胃尙佳。</p>
<p>明王參到貨殊尠，胡椒前市報升，今以銷寂市乃趨平，茴香銷路漸緩，市吿回跌，冬菇因香港帮採辦，再以已當時令（年菜），價遂上升，笋干到貨尙衆，銷路正待開展。</p>
<h3>染織廠可望復蘇</h3>
<p>中小型染織廠，於抗戰勝利前，受敵僞統制電力綦嚴，自經濟部規定生產用電後，爲求獎勵生產計，不予限制，故已紛紛接電開工，隴海綫四川長江各帮已動，各廠染色遂形忙碌非凡，由此推測，染織業復蘇有望。</p>

<h3>賬面資金意見　市商會尙在討論中</h3>
<p>〔本報特訊〕工商業僞幣帳面資本金額折合問題，業經會計師公會市商會及各專家分別討論，迄未有具體辦法，市商會所組織之工商法規研究委員會，曾組設小組委員會研究其事，僉以二百作一之收兌僞券辦法，固不適於帳面資本之折合，而此外實未有相當標準，可資推行，數日前曾分函各業同業公會徵求意見，以便彙總，然後酌定標準，向主管機關建議，日來各業公會已紛紛將此項意見書送交市商會，聞市商會對此問題仍在鄭重討論中，據染織業及棉布業同業公會負責人談稱，前會計師公會所假定之三項辦法，尙値得贊同。惟帳面資本金額折合後所得之假盈餘，政府如亦須嚴課所得稅及利得稅。是不啻虛帳實課，本市工商業當不能忍受，故主張向政府建議，對於此項稅收，應變通辦理，以免經營者在核算帳面資本金額時，多所顧忌云。</p>

<h3>中國木刻展覽會　將在倫敦舉行</h3>

<h3>我國圕人才的搖籃　武昌文華圖書館學專校　在重慶嘉陵江北岸建立起了新的堡壘</h3>
<p>『私立武昌文華岡書館學專科學校」，不是一個十分陌生的名字。無論在大江南北，只要一提起「文華」，沒有一個不曉得的，它和它的前身——武昌文華大學，在中國敎育界有過燦爛的紀錄，爲中國作育了不少人才，它的聲譽在國外與『淸華」『聖約翰』同樣被人珍視，認爲中國唯一有權威與悠久歷史的圖書館人才的訓練機構。今日從事於圖書館事業的，十之八九都直接間接出於「文華』的搖籃。</p>
<p>隨軍西撤</p>
<p>抗戰以後，「文華』隨軍西上，從武昌遷到重慶，在曾家岩求精中學校園裏，找了幾幢房子，繼續上課，不幸到了三十年夏天，被敵機炸毀，迫不得已，又要另尋安置，終於由師生們的奮鬥，不到一年，在嘉陵江的北岸，一個人烟稀少的鎭旁，建立起了新的堡壘。</p>
<p>廖家花園是個慶蕪已久的小園，三年來，不斷的經營，墾殖，已經是個美麗的小天地了。一塊綠油油的三角地，矗立著三五幢房子，一年四季有各種花草招待遠近的遊客，像春天的桃李，夏天的夾竹桃，秋天的桂菊，冬天的二梅，使這一塊小天地，終年盛裝，鶴立於江北的羣山中。</p>
<p>逐漸擴充</p>
<p>初到廖園，那時只有一統問房子，上課，吃飯，集會，睡覺，都在那裏面。三年來，一幢幢蓋了起來，今天，已經很够應用了，寬敞的禮堂，廣大的圖書館，舒適的課室和睡房，使學生們生長在一個安定的生活裏。近又添裝了電燈，格外使這小小的園子生色不少，每到晚上，遠遠望去，點點燈火，交織成一幅美麗的夜景，學生們所以今天能够安適地弦歌不輟，首先要歸功於老校長沈祖榮先生。他是賢明的領導者！有着奮鬥的精神超人的毅力！</p>
<p>內部分科</p>
<p>該校現分二科：圖書館學，和檔案管理。肄業的學生連今年暑假新招的二班，共只五班，計七十人，他們都是來自各省的熱忱靑年，全受過高中以上的敎育，對於這兩種新興科目，都抱有絕大的信心。他們在校，須學習二年實際的理論與技術。如同：圖書館經營法，行政學，中西編目法，中西目錄學，分類學，各種分類法，定購法，參考工作，參考書，序列法，索引術，檢字法，檔案經營與行政，檔案編目，中西檔案學，資料管理，史籍整理，人事管理，公文研究，打字，實習……等等，和各科概論，國文，英文，第二外國語（德文，日文，法文），統計二年內，要習滿一百學分。畢業前呈繳畢業論文，經敎授會通過，方准畢業。</p>
<p>專家任課</p>
<p>該校任課敎授，關於專門學科，全由國內圖書館學權威和檔案專家擔任。上年度增聘李湧泉氏授博物館學，本年又增聘陸華深，李永增二氏，擔任圖書館經營法與行政學選購等科目，足見學校當局，雖在經濟極度爲難之情形下，還在不斷地延攬良師增强陣容。</p>
<p>除對專門課程外，學校當局並深切注重同學對外國語之學習，如英文會English　Speaking　Society之組織，其目的在使同學將所學用之實際使用，以校正其拼音，語氣，姿熊習慣之錯誤，養成習慣，而逐漸致之於正途。若千課程如編目法，參考書，目錄學，檔案學等，亦採取原本圖書，以英語講解。又如放映影片圖書Microfilm　Reading等等，以訓練其視聽之能力。凡此種種設施均足促成同學之長足進步。</p>
<p>添置新書</p>
<p>圖書館在這圖書館學專科學校裏，似乎更形活躍，除了整天忙着給敎授們蒐集材料和帮助同學選擇參考用書及解答間題外，更須要做一個工作，做一示範，因此它較之普通一般圖書館又多一重職責。在經費獨立的原則下，圖畫館的新書源源的流入來，而且不息的流通着，如同太陽的遝行一樣，使每一讀者有迅速享受新書的權利與機會。最近英美大使館，送贈了很多圖書，而美國圖書館協會與各圖書館學學校又捐贈該校大批圖書，這將更增加該校圖書館的效率。</p>
<p>該校對於圖書館學與檔案學的研究，曾有研究部之設，八年來，可說沒有片刻停息，有很多新的發見和創作。可惜因爲戰時物力艱難，無法付印問世，供圖書館界的參考。現在抗戰勝利結束，他們正預備在這一方面努力，在最近的將來，當有一番貢獻。現在主其事的，是留美圖書館學碩士徐家麟敎授。</p>
<p>將回武昌</p>
<p>復員是目前最迫切的一件事，誠如蔣主席說復員不是復原，據悉，「文華」不但要搬回武昌，而且要擴大成院，並且要設立一個示範性質的圖書館，永遠走在人的前面，相輔領導中國圖書館事業的發展。可是碩大的中國，需人太多，人才太少，爲了要訓練人才，爲了要建設圖書館需要人才，更須要若干高級人才和師資。據聞英美圖書館界，爲了帮助我國圖書館之建設，已紛紛設立研究生學額，以供我國圖書館學者之深造。我國有關當局亦已注意及此，將於最近年來，逐年考選圖書館學學生出國。該校副敎授徐家璧氏，且已於上月初出國赴英，考察英國圖書館事業，並將順道赴美考察圖書館學敎育云。</p>

<h3>狂歡聖誕日　應念流離人</h3>
<p>— 本報記者潔</p>
<p>我們都是新人，在上海每個角落里生長，頹廢腐化，黑暗墮落，這糜爛的生活，如今要英勇的淸償！同志們，今天快把頭腦身體來鍛鍊，明犬就是國家有用的棟樑，醒醒吧！醒醒吧！一起走上敎室奔工廠，禮義廉恥，光明磊落，是學習的準繩，頹廢腐化，黑暗墮落，在工作中掃光！同志們！努力吧！我們都是新人，是　設新中國的力量！</p>
<p>在這一片熱烈雄壯的歌聲中，我們看到近千的一羣急待社會慈善人士救濟的難民難童，使我非常的感動！抗戰勝利後的第一個聖誕節前夜，全上海都沉醉在狂歡的漩渦裏—也許不會注意到在都市極僻靜的一角，漕河涇上海市救濟院難民難童收容所，他們雖然也在舉行一個慶祝聖誕節的同樂會，但還有睡在病牀上沒有人去同情哀憐帮助的四十多個可憐的難胞！</p>
<p>八年來的砲火，也許已養成了人們殘酷的心裏，對於這慘絕人寰的現實，雖也曾震盪一時心情，過後也就像流水烟　，成爲過去，淡然遺忘。看到大酒店大舞廳大劇塲冠蓋雲集，賓至如歸，紙醉金迷的聚舉塲面，和牆角邊的倒斃者，成了强烈的對照，令人憶想到古人「朱門酒肉臭，路有凍屍骨」的悲吟，這該是誰的責任？</p>
<p>許多人，對於所謂癟三，乞丐小偸之流，只有憎恨，厭惡和鄙業，而沒有同情，悲憫和悲愛，這人羣的一角，永遠爲社會所遺棄，過着悽慘的非人生活。人類究竟是萬物之靈，是偉大的，是博愛的，要不是迷失了本性，誰也不應該蔑視他們的悲慘遭遇，我敢肯定的說：他們之所以成爲社會餘渣，這不是他們的罪惡，也不是他們的責任！</p>
<p>上海難民難童收容所，過去是世界紅卍字會主辦的流民習勤所，在僞府期間，曾被改爲「勞動營」，勝利後又成了國軍的營舍，佔地九十七畝强，在十月二十六日社會局舉命接收，到十一月一日正式開始收容上海市難民難童，在短短的時期中，他們動員了自己的力量除去了沒脛的蔓草，成堆的瓦藥，從荒蕪的泥土上建立起幽雅的，美麗的境地，第一個使人感覺好感的便是井井有條的佈置，莊嚴·肅穆兼而有之。</p>
<p>至聖誕前夜止，他們那裏已收容了九百六十六個難民難童，大多數都是警局保送去的，自投的極少數，計壯健的四百四十九名，兒童四百六十四名，婦女六名，老弱四十七名，都按照他或她的年齡，性別，加以分類。這近千的人數中份子是複雜極了，有公認爲社會敗類的癟三，乞丐，地病，流氓，小偸以至　手，有父母雙亡的孤兒，有忍心被拋棄的私生子，有公務員，有小商人，也有進過高等學府的大學生，怎樣去管理訓導這數以千計的　民，眞是一個嚴重的問題，這一點周所長祖望向記老提出，他說：現在他們以訓導爲中心，另外又設立管理生活·敎育。特別敎育三組，至於日常生活，簡括的說是精神重於一切，完全軍事化，除早晚升降旗二次大集合精神講話外，共他如體格鍛鍊，勞動服役，個別談話，小組討論等，每天不斷地進行着。他們的口號是「敎養兼施，工讀並重」，他們施敎原則，在兒童是讀書重於工作，在壯健是工作重於讀盡，在老弱則以撫養爲唯一的任務。</p>
<p>爲養成難民難童自治精神，什麼都由他們自己管理，所有四十多位職員祗負監督的責任，他們劃分了區·戶·現等許多小單位，另外有依照難民的技能，編成了許多工作隊，如泥水，木作，廚房，縫紉，洗濯等。</p>
<p>難民難童中患有皮膚病花柳病及白面癮的很多，約佔百分之卅以上，現在已由衛生局派有醫師二位護士三位常川駐所負責診療。如果遇到病重的，另送仁濟。時疫或市立醫院診治，故在衛生上已有了保障。</p>
<p>該所額定收容人數是一千二百名至一千五百名，警察局希望他們能容納到一萬名，這在金錢物質二感缺乏的情形下，祗有希望社會熱心慈善事業的大善士多多慷慨解囊。</p>
<p>最後記者附帶報吿的，在昨夜同樂會上社會局福利處長毛子佩和科長黃惕人專員嚴長衍等特地去參加，確是値得敬佩，的確我們不能忽略了這一羣被人們遺忘的難胞。</p>

<p>風俗</p>
<h3>聖誕節的掌故</h3>
<p>— 張培月</p>
<p>聖誕節的起源</p>
<p>普通大家都以爲十二月二十五日是耶穌的誕日，聖誕節就是慶祝他的生日的。其實耶穌究竟是那一天降生，歷史上並沒有詳實的紀載。當初歐西各國民族，每年冬至原舉行節令慶祝，大約就在十二月廿五開始。後來基督徒拿慶祝耶誕來替代原先的遊樂，該天逐變作耶穌的誕辰，大家都相信耶穌是十二月二十四夜半降生的了。但直到現在，慶祝耶穌誕日時，仍保留着許多古代民族節季的遊樂。</p>
<p>相傳第一次慶祝耶穌誕日，是英王亞塔爾皇帝，在英國約克城，那年是西歷五百二十一年。</p>
<p>聖誕節賀片</p>
<p>「恭祝聖誕」的賀片是英國人發明的。最初大家祗不過口頭上道賀，後來英國人習慣相沿，每到聖誕節淸晨，要到挨家的窗口呌喚這句話。不久大家將賀語寫在信上互相寄贈。直到一八西六年，倫敦有十個藝術家，名呌康約瑟的，才用石印印上賀詞，用彩色繪上圖畫，大小同名片差不多，那是第一張聖一誕節賀片。</p>
<p>聖誕老人</p>
<p>聖誕老人穿着紅衣服，拖着白鬍子，背着大袋的玩具，可以說完全是爲一　孩子們設造出來的。所以各國的聖誕老人都是從保護兒童的神聖化出來的。德國保護兒童的神是Christk,ndleln，聖誕老人就呌做Kriss,Kringle。荷蘭是St.Nichola　s，聖誕老人仍呼爲St.Nichola　s，但傳到美國後，就變作Santaclaus了。他名字雖各地稍微不同，但他的使命是一樣的，就是增加孩子的興緻。所以他總是背着玩具，從爐烟突裏溜下來，把東西塞在牀面前掛的襪十裏面。</p>
<p>講到烟突同襪十的起源，也很有趣，原來英國人老早就有和我們歲底掃塵的風俗相似，在新年前頭，必須是將烟突打掃幹凈讓好運道進來，再一湊活，聖誕老人每次就從烟突中下來了。掛襪十是英美人想出來的，原先荷蘭兒童是把鞋子放在爐邊，據說聖誕老人必須是看到鞋子擺好在那裏，才將玩具塞在裏面，英美人更聰明，用了襪子，襪子可伸開，地方又大些，儘可多放些東西進去。</p>
<p>聖誕樹和冬青</p>
<p>聖誕樹的起源，傳說倒不一致，有人說是路得興起的，說他因爲要使他的孩子看星光下雪樹的景子，遂在園中砍斷株小杉樹，　在房內，上面燃起起蠟燭來。那天晚上正是聖誕節前夕，後人就相製下來。但也有人說是聖文佛利興出來的，他有一次在林中砍一株大橡　，一陣大風過時，樹木多折倒，獨有一株小杉樹元立不動，聖文佛和遂宣稱這是聖樹，聖誕節遂用它來點綴了。還有聖誕節用冬靑，起源也很早，古代羅馬人川桂枝代表和平勝利喜樂，後來基督從沿襲着，用桂枝點綴窗戶，意思耶穌曾進來過。英國人川冬靑替代了桂枝，據說冬靑白色的花象徵聖潔，紅色的實象徵耶穌爲罪人流的血，冬青編的花圈更代表耶穌殉難時頭上　的棘刺王　。</p>
<p>隨筆</p>
<h3>聖誕節和聖誕老人</h3>
<p>— 樂羣</p>
<p>戰神把聖誕老人吼走了，這樣，他可以自由自在的儘管　進兵力，去滿足他的殺人　。結果，侵略的戰爭開始了，由東亞到西歐，到整個地球。接連不斷的砲火的氣息，充滿了世界。聖誕節那天的聖誕老人敢下來嗎？</p>
<p>但是，終於，侵略者投降了。於是，今年的聖誕節算是要比往年熱閙了，因爲人們都相信「和平」的世界裏，聖誕老人必定能到地上來，賜予人們以幸　。我們也但願這樣，使我們苦了八年的老百姓們寬鬆地伸一下　腰。或者政府定聖誕節爲我們的民族復興節，用意就在此吧！</p>
<p>街上商店的廚窗裏，　　着許多不同的聖誕老人圖像和聖誕樹，聖誕賀年片……，把街面弄得太好看了。正和勝利消息發出後的主席像一樣，眞够前後媲美！學校放假，公司打烊，一片太平的氣象。</p>
<p>到一個外國的朋友家裏去，巧極了，那位朋友的父親母親和妹妹弟弟擠在一塊兒，　置一個一間屋子大小的聖誕老人圖案。看他們的勁兒，眞是够味。據那位朋友吿訴我，他們已花費了　金數百元，還沒有全部成功。感激朋友的母親，說我是外國人，不知道這之間的　故，詳細的指點我說：某處是聖誕老人的進門處，某處是孩子受降福的地方，某處是……使我奇怪的是：聖誕老人不走大門和窗戶，而却從烟肉裏走下來，無怪那位朋友的母親說我不懂掌故了。</p>
<p>今年聖誕節的聖誕老人能下來是可　的了，每個盼望過聖誕節的人們都在這樣想。我呢，也是同樣。</p>
<h3>新聞背景</h3>
<p>— 余範</p>
<p>聯合國善後救濟總署督辦萊孟（Herbert　H.Lehman）向國會提出第二年的十三萬五千萬元預算案。</p>
<p>倫敦有人向一家報館建議發起救濟歐洲難民運動，願將自己極刻薄的配給糧食節省下來，捐充　舉，結果一月中　應者三萬人。</p>
<p>法國有一個美國士兵致函屋條報編者說：「我們實在吃得太豐富太肥美。全歐洲有這許多人，男的女的，老的幼的，都處於飢餓的困境，爲什麼我們一定要被　肥得像猪　？請損有餘以奉不足，我願吃得少一些吧」。</p>
<p>美國與歐洲形成强烈的對比，凍餒飢寒等等字樣，在美國早已淡而忘之。聖誕火雞正一車一車裝運過來；爲避免購肉擁擠，限價提高二分一磅；皮鞋配給制已取消以後可大量生產，自由購買；「耐綸』人造絲襪新貨將於聖誕節應市；勝利公司不碎唱片上市；RCA新式無錢電機。</p>
<p>據估計日本，明年須輸入食物三百四十萬噸，共値三萬萬元，始能免於飢饉。然而日本　己沒有能力，不僅要靠盟國貸這筆巨款，還須仰賴盟國船隻把食物運到日本。</p>
<p>在中國，八年中不斷的戰火蹂躪，不斷的逃亡流浪，『人民需要救濟是如何的迫切，非任何人所敢揣測。』</p>
<p>小品</p>
<h3>我的第一個聖誕節</h3>
<p>— 中西女中初二級　鄭璧如</p>
<p>啊！兒時的聖誕節是多麼的快樂呀！</p>
<p>在聖誕節的前一星期，母親和舅母帶了我們到公司裏去，要我們選擇自己所愛的禮物；我要了一付跳繩的繩子和一匣着色畫紙，這是我所久想要的，雖然那時我還不會着巴；哥哥們每人選了一把劍上有七顆紅星的七星寳劍，和一把汽槍。</p>
<p>聖誕節的前幾天，我還參加了聖誕禮拜，（那是我生平第一次），當唱詩班婉轉的唱着讚美詩，慢慢的步入時，前面的兩個人手中拿着金色的十字架，和一面鮮紅的旗，我還以爲是天使來了，快樂得拍着小手，呌道：「呀！媽，看呀！小天便，小天使！』媽趕快阻止了我。聖誕夜的前一天，客廳裏裝置好了聖誕樹，樹上掛滿了金，銀，色的聖誕鐘和小星星，又裝着無數的燈泡，藍的，紅的，……五顏之色的。樹頂上聳着一顆大星，一面銀色，一面金色，這也是我們久盼的東西。在聖誕夜，我們吃好夜飯，就坐在客廳中等，一會兒，電燈媳滅了，我們同聲地呌道：「呀！這一聲呌喊，又是驚又是喜；驚的是電燈熄了，可是同時聖誕樹上的燈却亮了，於是這呌聲又變爲喜了。啊！多美呀！那五色的燈光，映着那金銀色的鐘和星，發出燦爛的光輝閃爍着，直逼我們的眼睛，幾乎睜不開來。那時的快樂是莫可言喩的。我們環着樹跳躍着，笑着，直到疲乏了才止。</p>
<p>這是兒時的第一個聖誕節，現在，和平來臨，光明重至人間，今年的聖誕節是和平後的第一個聖誕節，所以又想回復從前一樣，盡興的慶祝一下。</p>

<p>戰爭</p>
<h3>羅美爾和傷兵</h3>
<p>— 今純</p>
<p>在北非戰役中，要以杜白魯克爭奪戰爲最激烈，該城曾由英德兩軍數出數進，幾番易手，演成慘烈的拉鋸戰。以下的故事就發生在杜白魯克，是該城中英國傷兵醫院的院長某大尉講的。</p>
<p>第一次羅美爾的軍隊突入杜白魯克，該醫院仍沈靜的照常工作着，抬來的傷兵，不論是英國兵或是德國兵，都一樣去醫治。</p>
<p>醫院中突的靜悄下來，羅美爾親自來了。他站着，望望一排排的病床。他走到一個德國傷兵身邊，簡單的問了一句，他靜靜的聽那傷兵講給他聽，他沿着一條病床走過去，時刻停下來問其他的德國傷兵。</p>
<p>最後，羅美爾向英國的大尉打了個招呼。他說，「我們的兵士吿訴我，說他們完全和英國兵士一樣受你們醫治照料。你們缺少藥品，但你們一樣分給他們用。我就派人送藥給你們。你們照這樣工作下去，沒有誰來騷擾你們的。」他說完，大踏步走出去。</p>
<p>藥很快的送來，醫院利用這些藥，救活了許多英國兵和德國兵。醫院進行工作時，果然不曾受到任何干涉，不曾遇到一點騷擾。</p>
<p>停了幾天，戰局突然轉變，羅美爾的軍隊棄城退走，但撤退時，該醫院一些不曾遭到損害。戰局轉移，勝負互迭，但該醫院祇管照常的工作着。</p>
<p>軼事</p>
<h3>林肯擦皮鞋</h3>
<p>— 孫喜麟</p>
<p>某一個淸晨，地點是在白宮。</p>
<p>秘書爲了「要公』，去訪大總統。由傳達者領導到一個廣大的客廳，走到應下，傍邊有一個男子不停地在格支格支擦皮鞋，秘書毫不留意地正想走過，不覺吃了一驚站住了。</p>
<p>原來大總統正在擦他自己的皮鞋。</p>
<p>「您是大總統，做這樣的事，被人看見，頗不雅觀，尤其是被責族婦人……」秘書往常聽人在背後說大總統時常露出鄉下人的粗野態度，記在心裏，今朝忍不住這樣說了。</p>
<p>林肯却滿臉微笑，對着秘書露出驚異的眼光：</p>
<p>『呀，擦皮鞋是可恥的事嗎？大總統與擦皮鞋的；同是爲世人而勞動的公僕。世間應無地位卑賤的職業，惟有心地卑劣的人。」</p>
<p>希望今日的達官顯宦們，能都一聆林肯總統的名言：『大總統與擦皮鞋的，同是爲世人而勞動的公僕！』</p>

<h3>聖誕夜的鐘聲</h3>
<p>— 張德乾</p>
<p>疏林和矮離戰慄在尖銳的朔風裏，檞樹已經結下　果。在這月白風淸的夜間，聖誕節的鐘聲爆出火花，從塔尖飛過屋頂，照徹了人類的靈魂。</p>
<p>敎堂裏的鐘聲抑揚，宣示着和平和慈惠，宣示着人類的一切美德。鐘聲的餘韻降落在村舍和旅店，降落在爐火深深的巨邸，溫暖了人類的靈魂。</p>
<p>在這神聖的夜間，沒有人聽見了敎堂裏的鐘聲，而不感覺到心裏有一顆星，把他黑暗的前途照亮了，使他更有勇氣在生之旅途邁進。因爲聖誕夜的鐘聲宣示着和平和慈惠，是基督以犧牲換來的。</p>
<p>人物</p>
<h3>杜魯門老太太</h3>
<p>— 沈翊鵾</p>
<p>杜魯門總統的母親，瑪莎杜魯門夫人，上個月　九十三歲，但仍很矯健；她不斷地閱讀美國國會紀錄，爲的是要知道那些議員們說點甚麼。她說：「我要活到一百歲。」</p>
<p>「哈里（杜魯門總統的名字）送國會紀錄給我，」她說時帶着得意的神情。</p>
<p>她的書一向是自己讀的，而且「不戴眼鏡」。直到去年，因爲跌傷，眼睛受了影響。才由杜魯門的妹妹瑪麗小姐讀給她聽。</p>
<p>杜魯門老太太和杜魯門小姐住在美岡詹克森郡的格蘭烏鎭，距坎薩斯城不遠，全鎭共有八百人口。他們住的是一座現代的黃色平屋，有五間房，和大街隔開一絛路。離開鎭外半哩就是古老的杜魯門田荘，杜魯門夫人曾在那裏消磨掉她大部的歲月。</p>
<p>杜魯門夫人於一八五二年十一月二十五日生於一個田荘內，就是今日坎薩斯城的東南住宅區。</p>
<p>一八八一年，她和的翰·杜魯門結婚，兩年以後，搬到離格蘭烏鎭一百哩的拉麻爾。一八八四年五月八日，杜魯門總統在這裹降生。</p>
<p>杜魯門老太太對國會很注意，但這不過是她關心世界大事的一個例子而已。她每天細心地閱讀　　晚報，而並且要給剪貼起來。她喜歡聽無綫電，特別愛好的是新聞節目和歐唱。</p>
<p>杜魯門老太太說：「我認爲人類不應該發明原子炸彈，我反對殺人。哈里也是擁護和平的。」</p>
<p>她有三個孫子參加第二次世界大戰：哈里·杜魯門軍曹（和總統同名）新近自魯賓孫營退休，參加過法　西，德國和奧地利的戰役；還有兩個是總統哥哥衛文的兒子。</p>

<p>美國援華救濟物資，上月起已有大批陸續運裝來滬，其中包括麥。麵粉。藥品·舊衣。罐頭。水果。建築。材料。麻袋·卡車等十餘種，截止目前爲止，本市除已有大量麵粉由救濟總署上海分署分贈各慈善團體及猶太僑民外，並將麵粉及罐顯食品兩種送入市塲普遍平售。根據中國救濟總署署長蔣廷黻氏上次在平談話此項救濟物資，並非完全免費救濟人民，係採平糶方法出售，以工代賑，售價則較市價減低百分之五云云，因是此次本市的麵粉價格每包亦須一千九百元之數，我們對於救濟物資採用平糶方法，自無異議，不過此項物資之運華，原在救濟國內戰後一般爲物價所迫無以爲生的貧苦大衆，尤其如麵粉之類，向爲平民日常食糧，中等人家以上，已很少食用，那就覺得所定價格，亦和其他物資同樣僅較市價減低百分之五，未免太苛，與「救濟」兩字的意義，也似不大相稱，不但平民沾惠很少，且大多仍有無力購買之苦，又如最近許多以採用麵粉爲主的大餅及吃食攤，亦並未因麵粉充斥於市而見跌價，便是一個鐵證。至於日前平售的罐頭水果及杏乾，其每聽價格竟有高至二千五百元者，則連中等階級亦難以享受，結果自不免爲一般富有者購去，廣吿上還登着很注目的「慈善救濟平賣」，更覺背題太遠了。</p>

<h3>Marshall Discusses His Mission to China: First to Listen to Opinions from All Sides; Chairman and Madame to Attend Banquet This Afternoon</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 24th Dispatch] U.S. Special Envoy General of the Army George C. Marshall met with dozens of Chinese and foreign reporters at the U.S. Embassy on Shefu Road at ten o'clock this morning. Marshall, with a youthful face and white hair, maintained the same solemn and calm expression he had when he disembarked from the plane the other day. Marshall wore a khaki U.S. Army jacket with five-star insignia on his shoulders. He stood calmly by the fireplace in the corner of the room and said briefly: "I am very pleased to meet with you reporters today. However, I have not been in China for long, so I do not have much to tell you. Moreover, my primary purpose here is to gather information and listen to opinions from all sides, some of which may not be as announced by external sources. The United States' policy towards China has been explained in detail by President Truman's statement, so there is no need to repeat it. My knowledge of China is limited, only gained a little bit in Washington and China in the past few weeks. I am certainly more familiar with the Chinese people's eight years of arduous war, as well as the great historical importance of the U.S. Army Air Forces personnel fighting alongside the Chinese army in China. I have never flown over the Hump; I have only lived in Tianjin, Beiping, Qinhuangdao, and Shanhaiguan for three years. As for Central China, South China, and Chongqing, I have never been there before. I have been very interested in China since before today, and after China was forced to rise up and resist the war, it has become even more concerned by the American people. Today, after the victory of the war, the American people are even more concerned about the Chinese people and world peace." Marshall paused slightly and said to the reporters, "If you have any questions now, you can ask them, but I am afraid there are some questions I cannot answer." The reporters then raised questions, which Marshall answered separately. Regarding how long Marshall would stay in China, he replied that it was undecided. When asked if he would go to Yan'an, he replied that it was not yet under consideration. When asked when the U.S. military would withdraw, Marshall smiled and said, "I don't know either, but all American officers and soldiers wish to return home as soon as possible."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 24th Dispatch] Special Envoy Marshall met publicly with Chinese and foreign reporters in the accompanying capital for the first time in his office on the morning of the 24th. By around 9:30 a.m., more than fifty reporters had gathered in the front corridor of the U.S. Embassy building, which was a rare grand occasion for a press conference in history. At 9:50 a.m., General Marshall, accompanied by U.S. Embassy Chargé d'Affaires Robinson, rushed to the embassy. In the misty rain, General Marshall stood on the lawn and gazed at the rainy scenery of the mountain city for three minutes, looking quite content. When General Marshall entered the lobby, he frequently nodded to the reporters standing by and said good morning. The press conference was then held in the special envoy's office. After Chargé d'Affaires Robinson gave a brief introduction, General Marshall delivered a speech, saying that there was nothing to report at the moment, and that a statement might be made in a few days. The United States is concerned about China's relationship with the future world and believes that China will contribute to maintaining world peace. The press conference ended in less than twenty minutes. General Marshall stood throughout the speech, his tone was calm and steady, and had the unique clarity of an eastern American. After the press conference, General Marshall shook hands with the reporters one by one and took photos as a souvenir.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 24th Dispatch] U.S. Special Envoy to China Marshall met with Executive Yuan President T.V. Soong at his residence on the morning of the 24th. Immediately afterwards, he hosted reporters at the U.S. Embassy. It is said that the U.S. government and himself personally are extremely concerned about the upcoming political consultative conference in China.</p>

<h3>Shenyang and Harbin to be Formally Handed Over Before New Year's Day; General Du Yuming to Inspect Beizhen County</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 24th Dispatch] Central representatives held a ceremony for the handover of Changchun, with Soviet representatives also participating. This is the first time since the fall of the Northeast that the Chinese government has recovered its old territory from the Soviet army. Changchun has been experiencing heavy snow for days, and has become a silver world. Residents have hung up the national flags of China and the Soviet Union to express their celebration, and the situation is very enthusiastic. Since arriving here, Zhang Jia'ao, chairman of the Economic Commission, has been in contact with the Soviet authorities and related parties for days. The Changchun Railway has been quite busy with passenger transport recently, and the placement of air transport cloth has also been completed. The local people are hoping that the army will arrive soon, so that the current chaotic state can be ended as soon as possible.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 24th Dispatch] In view of the fact that the entry of the National Army into the Northeast has generally been stepped up, it seems that the formal handover of Shenyang and Harbin by the central government from the Soviet side will be realized before New Year's Day. Local Chinese newspapers believe that this acceleration is due to the "more friendly attitude of the Soviet side." After the National Government took over Changchun on the weekend, the Chinese mayors of Harbin and Fanyang, who attended the Changchun handover ceremony, reportedly left Changchun by plane yesterday to fly to their respective posts, accompanied by many experts, including responsible personnel from the Central Bank. It is expected that other experts from the National Government will also fly from Ping. "Republican Daily" reported that the follow-up troops of the National Army, transported by American transport ships and landed on Huludao, have arrived in Jin County and are now crossing the city to advance towards Shenyang. According to other newspaper reports, General She Yupan's troops are also spreading out in a fan shape towards Yingkou, threatening this port currently occupied by the Communist army. The situation of the National Army in the Northeast is improving day by day, but the activities of the Communist army behind the front line continue to increase.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 24th Dispatch] The troops advancing towards Shenyang for handover reached Beizhen on the 23rd. On the morning of the 24th, General Du Yuming personally went to Beizhen County for inspection. It is expected that he will be able to reach Heishan and Qianhou Dahushan on the evening of the 24th. According to reliable information, the Communist army in the Yixian area has shown signs of wavering.</p>
<h3>Soviet Military Delegation to Visit Guangzhou</h3>

<h3>Commander-in-Chief He Encourages Party and Government Personnel</h3>
<p>Hoping that all units will rectify discipline</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th Dispatch] Commander-in-Chief He reported on the main points of the instructions given by Chairman Chiang on the 22nd when he convened a meeting of responsible persons from the Party, government, and military in Nanjing: (1) The central and local receiving personnel have not been able to fully utilize the enemy and puppet materials and factories they have received, and should find ways to utilize them in the future. (2) The places where various organs and troops in Nanjing are stationed are still not clean enough, and each sick soldier in the hospital only has two military blankets, which is still insufficient, and should be improved as soon as possible. (3) The destroyed parts of Nanjing City have not been completely tidied up, and the suburban highways should be tidied up and repaired as soon as possible. This work should be undertaken by Japanese prisoners of war as soon as possible. (4) The Army Headquarters has not fully exercised its powers to guide and supervise the Party and government organs to promote all matters to perfection. Before the official return to the capital, the Army Headquarters should be responsible for exercising its powers to supervise and guide the Party and government affairs in the recovered areas of the headquarters, so that all recovery work can be smoothly promoted. He hopes that the responsible comrades of the Party and government will work harder so as not to disappoint Chairman Chiang's earnest expectations, and hopes that any shortcomings will be reported at any time. He also encourages all military organs and troops to rectify discipline.</p>

<h3>National Assembly Representatives Express Opinions on the Current Situation; Believing That the Way to Solve the Current National Affairs Lies in Returning the Army to the State and Returning Politics to the People</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 24th Dispatch] Representatives of the National Assembly issued a joint opinion on the current situation on National Renaissance Day, stating: "We believe that the way to solve the current national affairs is nothing more than two points, namely returning the army to the state and returning politics to the people. The army is a tool to defend the country and protect the people. No party shall own it privately. It must be returned to the state. The reason is very clear and need not be repeated. Political power is entrusted to the people of the whole country, so we should end the tutelage and return it to the people. Today, the National Government exercises political power. In theory, it is based on the legacy of the National Father Sun Yat-sen, and in law, it is based on the 'Law of the Republic of China during the Period of Political Tutelage' promulgated in the 20th year of the Republic of China (1931). The former stipulates that reaching constitutionalism through political tutelage is the highest principle of our revolution and nation-building. The latter is entrusted to the National Conference to return political power to the people, and the only object should be the National Assembly convened in accordance with the law, and the popularly elected government should be formally organized by the National Assembly to exercise governance. Apart from this, the National Government has no power to privately transfer power. Chairman Chiang solemnly declared at the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association on March 1 this year: 'We can only return political power to the National Assembly representing the people of the whole country, and cannot return political power to the party meetings of various parties or their coalition governments.' The words are concise and profound, and are indeed an unshakeable truth.</p>
<p>The Political Consultative Conference that is about to be held has no legal basis, but it is a kind of negotiation to resolve party disputes, so that the opinions of various parties on national affairs tend to be consistent. However, major national plans cannot be decided without a genuine public opinion organ in accordance with the law. The representatives of this National Assembly are legally elected by the people, and cannot be loved or hated by various parties, nor can they be changed by the Political Consultative Conference. If the belief in this basic and great legal principle is not firm and the measures are uncertain, the government's painstaking efforts to seek peace and unity will be unattainable, and it will give opportunists an opportunity to take an inch and move forward, which will be endless.</p>
<p>This National Assembly is the foundation for our country's constitutional governance, and convening it on time is indeed a clear path to solve national affairs. In a democratic system, the rule of law comes first. If any party does not adhere to the normal track of constitutionalism in this modern country, and places the interests of the party above the interests of the people, and does not hesitate to destroy the law and disrupt discipline, and shake the foundation of the country, then chaos and disorder will follow one another, which will not only affect the international status, but also threaten world peace.</p>
<h3>Enemy and Puppet Materials in Pingjin Sold to the People as Much as Possible</h3>

<h3>First Batch of Our Medicinal Materials Arrived in Singapore</h3>

The local authorities have provided special facilities for unloading. It is said that other goods will be shipped to Singapore in a steady stream. Due to numerous difficulties, there will be no lights, meat, or beer to drink this Christmas. Most of the streets here are lit by gas lamps. However, due to the gas workers' strike, it is dark and without lights. After the slaughterhouse workers went on strike, there was no meat to eat. The brewery workers also went on strike, so there was no beer to drink either.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th Dispatch] U.S. Commander of the China Theater General Albert Wedemeyer spent Christmas Eve with Commander-in-Chief He Yingqin in Nanjing today, and delivered a speech at He's dinner. In addition to thanking Commander-in-Chief He for the festival feast on behalf of his subordinates who are far from their homeland, he said that he was deeply gratified to be able to spend the first Christmas in peace after winning the victory in arduous battles. However, both our countries, China and the United States, bear a major responsibility for future world peace. Only by vigorously maintaining lasting peace can we live up to the heroic soldiers who have already sacrificed heroically. Therefore, China and the United States must cooperate closely to seek this lasting peace, and cooperate closely to seek China's peace and prosperity. The host of today's dinner was Commander-in-Chief He. In addition to General Wei, more than ten Americans including Colonel Stadard were invited to participate.

<h3>Exchange Rate Between Northeast Circulation Certificates and Legal Tender to be Quoted Daily; Puppet Manchukuo Currency and Soviet Military Notes to be Prepared for Clearance</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 24th Dispatch] According to sources, the exchange rate between the Northeast circulation certificates and the legal tender will no longer be fixed. Instead, the Central Bank will quote the rate daily. Holders of legal tender wishing to exchange for circulation certificates must apply to the Central Bank, similar to purchasing foreign exchange. This measure aims to prevent a large-scale transfer of funds to Northeast China, affecting the region's finance and prices. The former puppet Manchukuo Central Bank banknotes and Soviet military notes will also be collected and cleared at an appropriate time. The status of legal tender in Northeast China currently varies by location. In Changchun, the Xingying (provisional military headquarters) absolutely prohibits the use of legal tender. In Jinzhou, however, a significant amount of legal tender is flowing into circulation. It is said that the exchange rate between legal tender and Manchukuo currency is three to one there. Regarding the issuance of currency in Northeast China, it is reported that the former Manchukuo Central Bank's total issuance was 800,000 million yuan. After Japan's surrender, the puppet Manchukuo government increased the issuance by 400,000 million yuan to pay for the dispersal of officials. The first batch of Soviet military notes amounted to 100,000 million yuan, and whether there will be further issuance is unknown. The National Government's issuance of Northeast circulation certificates is currently very small. 50 million yuan was transported on the 13th of this month, and another 50 million yuan was transported on the 21st, totaling 100 million yuan. This disparate situation should be eliminated after the opening of the Jinzhou branch of the Central Bank. The salaries of administrative personnel in Northeast China have a significant impact on the social economy. After repeated discussions, the authorities have reportedly set the salary for senior officials at 9,000 yuan per month. If prices in Northeast China do not fluctuate significantly, this amount should be sufficient for honest officials to maintain their integrity. Prices in Northeast China are very low. If financial matters are handled properly in the future, society will easily stabilize.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 24th Dispatch] The Central Bank transported Northeast circulation certificates to Jinzhou. Twenty-eight boxes arrived on the 23rd, and fourteen boxes arrived on the 24th. Business can begin once preparations are complete.</p>
<h3>A Tour of the Entire Peiping-Jinzhou Line</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 22nd Dispatch] The smooth passage of the Peiping-Ning (Peiping-Liaoning) Railway to Jinzhou not only provides psychological security for the people of the north but also allows for the free flow of goods in the economy, restoring free trade. The day after the Peiping-Jinzhou railway reopened to traffic, the reporter boarded a train from Peiping to Jinzhou to conduct a full-line inspection. The journey took three days. The train had heating and was well-protected by American and Chinese troops. More than 4,000 passengers safely reached their destination in the most pleasant mood. The restoration of the 1,192 Li (Chinese miles) of railway communication inside and outside the Guandong (关东 - Manchuria, northeast China) in the most difficult circumstances is truly the most successful demonstration after victory. This cannot be achieved without the great cooperation of the Allied forces, the National Army, and the farmers. If there were no harassment by the Communist army, restoring day and night traffic would reduce the travel time by half. When the train departed from Peiping Station, the purchase of tickets to Jinzhou was extremely enthusiastic, and the passenger train reached fifteen carriages. The train service between Peiping and Tianjin was fast and arrived on time. The 134 kilometers to Tianjin and Tangshan took longer because the line had just been repaired, and it took five hours to reach Tangshan. The facilities on both sides of the railway were damaged by the Communist army, especially the condition of the villages, which was appalling. The army arrived in Tangshan at 5:00 PM, and passengers stayed overnight in Tangshan and changed trains to continue forward. Tangshan was bustling with passengers and cargo, showing prosperity. It was the time when the Kailuan Mining Company moved back to Tianjin, and the celebration at the station was very lively. Kailuan never stopped working from beginning to end. The bridges defended by 50,000 workers against the enemy were protected by the US Marine Corps stationed there. The US military set up tents at the bridgeheads at seven degrees below zero to guard them, and every passenger was deeply moved. Therefore, whenever the train passed over the railway bridge, the passengers would stretch their hands out the window and shout "Ding Hao" ("Top Good"). The American soldiers would also reply with a smile, "Ding Hao." In the broad fields near Beidaihe, two American soldiers were repairing a telephone on the spot, and a Chinese child was riding on one of them, showing great diligence in protecting property. It is said that they can produce 9,500 tons of coal every day. Tangshan has a population of 200,000, and the National Army and the Allied forces are jointly maintaining order, and the local situation is very stable. There are occasional bandit disturbances forty Li around Tangshan, but there is nothing to fear. In the morning, the train traveled east from Tangshan, passing Guye, Changli, Su Xian, Beidaihe, Qinhuangdao to Shanhaiguan. Along the way, over seventy American soldiers had two children sitting on their shoulders, watching the telephone repairs. Looking out the train window, it was truly a beautiful picture, and I was deeply moved. I arrived in Shanhaiguan at 7:00 PM and stayed overnight in Shanhaiguan Town. The surrounding area was a scene of ruins, and the crimes of the Communist army were vividly displayed. The 70,000 residents were struggling to survive after the disaster. They tearfully recounted the Communist army's conscription and looting, and they were especially grateful for the National Army's rescue, and for the National Army's painful decision not to fire a single shot at the Communist army from the pass. On the morning of the 20th, I changed trains out of the pass, and it took eight hours to travel 182 kilometers. On both sides were forests, plains, fertile and lovely, with herds of cattle and sheep everywhere. The double-track railway built by the Japanese has been partially destroyed, and thousands of workers are rushing to repair it. In small villages along the way, there are still Communist soldiers hiding, but they are few in number. The train traveled through several small stations, and everywhere I saw farmers angrily burning the Communist army's border area banknotes. According to reports, the villagers suffered greatly from these banknotes. This section of the line was tightly protected by brave soldiers who fought north and south in the extreme cold of fourteen degrees below zero. All the passengers in the train deeply respected their loyalty to the country and the people. After the reporter left the pass, I constantly heard the people hoping that President Chiang could visit Northeast China. The people's eagerness for good governance, and the enthusiasm to see the leader's demeanor, filled my ears and eyes. The train arrived in Jinzhou City in the dim evening. Seeing a large number of troops departing for the front, the exhaustion of the three days was completely forgotten by this exciting scene.</p>

<h3>UN Preparatory Committee Concludes; General Assembly Scheduled for Next Month; Gu Weijun Delivers Closing Remarks on Behalf of All</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 24th Dispatch] At 5:00 PM yesterday (1:00 AM Shanghai time), the preliminary work of the first plenary session of the United Nations organization was completed. The 51 representatives of the Preparatory Committee had been meeting since yesterday morning and had passed the final items on the agenda of its last meeting by the afternoon. [Central News Agency, London, 23rd Dispatch] The representatives of the countries on the UN Preparatory Committee elected Gu Weijun on the afternoon of the 23rd as the speaker of the last meeting to deliver the closing remarks on behalf of all, to express the greatest respect to China, which was the first to be invaded in World War II. Gu immediately represented the Chinese delegation in expressing his appreciation to the chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the achievements of the committee's work, and for the spirit of cooperation and enthusiasm among the representatives of various countries that promoted the rapid and optimistic results of the work. He then thanked the Chairman, the Secretary, and all the staff of the Preparatory Committee on behalf of all the delegations for their leadership and assistance. He also expressed his deep gratitude to the British government for its reception and the conveniences it provided, which enabled the conference to achieve great success. Gu continued, "We firmly believe that when the United Nations General Assembly meets in January next year, the work we have completed will greatly facilitate the future General Assembly in establishing various major institutions. In this important era, we have already seen the signs of peace. The work of the Preparatory Committee has been completed, and the establishment of a new world organization will be seen on January 13th next year, on which the hopes of all mankind truly depend."</p>
<p>Building Completed in Four Stages [Central News Agency Reporter Ren Lingxun, London, 23rd Dispatch] The completion of the various tasks of the UN Preparatory Committee today shows that the construction of the United Nations organization has entered the final stage. The construction of the United Nations organization is divided into four stages: first, the Dumbarton Oaks Conference, at which the United States, China, Britain, and the Soviet Union reached a general agreement on the preliminary system of this world organization, which was confirmed at the Yalta Conference in February of this year. The second stage was completed by the San Francisco Conference held on May 27 of this year. At that time, the UN Charter was drawn up, and the Preparatory Committee was established. The third stage began seven weeks later, on August 16 of this year, when the Executive Committee of the Preparatory Committee held a meeting. The Executive Committee was composed of 14 countries, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Czechoslovakia, France, Iran, Mexico, the Netherlands, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Yugoslavia. After nine weeks of detailed discussions, the Executive Committee passed a huge report, which contained detailed rules for the establishment of various important institutions of the United Nations organization. This report became the basis for the Preparatory Committee's discussion. The Preparatory Committee began work on November 24 of this year and ended this afternoon. After more than four weeks of review, the eight technical subcommittees formed by the Preparatory Committee thoroughly considered all points of the Executive Committee's report, some proposing revisions, some not adding revisions, and some rejecting them entirely, but most were adopted. Only 15 countries participated in the Executive Committee, while 51 countries attended the Preparatory Committee.</p>
<p>The most exciting part of the decisions made by the Preparatory Committee was that most of them were unanimously approved. Problems that caused heated debates, such as the organization of the Secretariat, the organization of the trusteeship system, and the selection of a permanent address, were all resolved satisfactorily. This is why most of the representatives who participated in the plenary session of the Preparatory Committee believed that the rapid completion of the work was a good sign. At the time of the Yalta Conference, no one predicted that this world organization could work effectively within a year. During the San Francisco Conference, some people did not believe that these 51 independent countries could agree on the details of the organization before the end of this year. According to the final report made by the eight technical subcommittees of the Preparatory Committee, the general</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Technology Secrets: Captured in Large Quantities by the American Occupation Forces; Information Gathered is Meticulous and Comprehensive</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd] According to a U.S. military intelligence report: Among the many military and technical secrets captured by U.S. forces in Japan, one is a torpedo that can be loaded onto aircraft to destroy submarines. This torpedo can hover underwater and continue until it hits the target and destroys it. The Japanese stopped continuing research on it a year ago because they lacked a satisfactory gyroscope controller. Lieutenant General Willoughby, Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence under MacArthur, said, "When our work in Japan is completed, the U.S. government will have more information about Japan than any other country has about another country." Among the 1,500 documents in U.S. military archives exposing various Japanese secrets is an account of an interview with former Japanese Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe. He told Allied interviewers that he knew Japan had virtually no hope of fighting the United States. Most Japanese leaders knew that Japan had been defeated when Saipan fell. Konoe stated that his sole purpose in China was to make Chinese leaders recognize their destiny as a great Eastern nation, and he had no intention of depriving China of its political and economic freedom during the Sino-Japanese War.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd] Lieutenant General Willoughby, Deputy Chief of Staff to MacArthur, stated that when our mission here concludes, the U.S. government will have a large amount of information about Japan, more than any other country has about another country. The documents and reports compiled and archived number over 1,500, and other materials are being collected. Hundreds of pieces of information are collected each week. Various investigation teams are currently conducting investigations throughout Japan, and all relevant data, large and small, are being collected. Several special investigation organizations are continuing the investigation work. Their efforts will undoubtedly uncover Japan's wartime secrets, and several Japanese mysteries will be revealed one by one. The scope of investigations conducted by American investigators is broad and all-encompassing. Just a few examples can illustrate the wide variety of investigation targets, from residential trees and food and eating habits to political situations. Even highly technical radar jet propulsion engines are within the scope of the investigation.</p>
<p>Radar Equipment Incinerated</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 24th] Radar equipment worth 500 million yuan, used to defend the primary target (B-29 Superfortress bombers bombing Yawata city), has been destroyed by the occupation forces. The radar equipment was incinerated, melting into soft steel and glass in fifteen minutes. The radar equipment was used in conjunction with six anti-aircraft guns to defend "Japan's Batzburg."</p>
<p>Large Quantities of Military Supplies Allotted to the Japanese</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Fukuoka, 24th] The U.S. Army's 32nd Division previously collected thousands of types of Japanese military necessities in Japan, all of which have now been handed over to the Fukuoka Prefectural Government for distribution to the Japanese people to help them get through the harsh winter.</p>
<p>Crimes in Tokyo Increasing Daily</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 24th] Kyodo News Agency reports that crime in Tokyo is increasing daily. On Saturday and Sunday, police rounded up thieves, arresting 900 men and 100 women, most of whom were charged with minor crimes, but there were several armed robbers among them.</p>
<h3>New National Government of Iran Begins its Mission; Kurdish People in the North Assist Iranian Troops</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 22nd] According to a TASS dispatch from Tehran on the 16th, the National Government of Azerbaijan in Iran has begun its mission. All government agencies in Azerbaijan Province have been taken over by the new government, and several officials who do not sympathize with the new government have gone to Tehran. On the 15th of this month, the garrison in the city of Ardabil surrendered entirely to the new government. The situation in the area controlled by the new government is peaceful, and the local people support the new government.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tehran, 24th] Iranian defense forces in several cities in the northern Iranian province of Azerbaijan are still resisting the attacks of the Democratic forces, while the Kurdish people, who have always opposed the Iranian military authority, have now changed their past attitude and are assisting the Iranian regular army in resisting the Assyrians, Caucasians, and Democratic forces.</p>
<h3>General Patton's Funeral Held in Heidelberg</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Heidelberg, 23rd] The remains of the famous American general Patton were laid to rest today in the 16th-century Christian church here. The ceremony was simple and moving, lasting only about two minutes. All of the highest-ranking American officers in Europe participated in the funeral procession, but the only relatives present were Patton's wife and his brother, Ayer. Many soldiers present at the solemn ceremony were moved, as were the German civilians. At the funeral procession from the church to the station, no fewer than 6,000 people lined the streets. Patton's remains were placed in a steel coffin covered with the national flag, led by a military band and sixteen armored vehicles, which will be transported by special train to Luxembourg for burial on Monday. Mrs. Patton, wearing a black leather coat and a black hat, and her brother rode in a car for the funeral procession. More than a dozen senior generals carried the coffin, and the new U.S. military commander in Europe, General McNair, also participated in the procession by car, moving as slowly as a frog's pace.</p>

<h3>Various Countries Enthusiastically Celebrate Christmas; Lights Relit in the White House Square; Singing Evokes Memories</h3>
<p>[British News Agency, London, 24th] This is the first Christmas after the victory, and the British people are celebrating with greater enthusiasm than in the past. The joyous Christmas carols and songs evoke many happy memories, and the six years of suffering are finally over.</p>
<p>[U.S. News Agency, Washington, 24th] The torch that was extinguished in 1941 was relit today in the White House Square. President Truman personally lit the Christmas tree and made a Christmas broadcast to countries around the world that are full of wounds (the original text has been seen in yesterday's newspaper). At the same time, veterans across the country are also trying to return to their respective hometowns to spend the holidays. The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration is planning to provide assistance to Belarus, Austria, Korea, and Taiwan as a Christmas gift to the world. The Red Cross clubs in all war zones where the U.S. military is stationed are fully open during the Christmas holidays to welcome the troops, and soldiers on their way back home will also receive about 1.25 million boxes of Christmas gifts.</p>
<p>MacArthur's Message</p>
<p>Hoping for Mutual Love Among Mankind</p>

I pray that the merciful Lord will support us so that we can dedicate ourselves to completing the ideal that Christ wants to realize in this world, that is, peace on earth and goodwill to all mankind."</p>
<p>Holy Land Holds</p>
<p>All-Day Prayer and Blessing</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Bethlehem, 23rd] Bethlehem, a small town in the mountains of Judea, the birthplace of Jesus Christ two thousand years ago, will be visited by countless believers again tomorrow. The St. Catherine Church here will hold all-day prayer, meditation, and procession blessings at that time. The ceremony is solemn and takes place every year, but this year, thousands of people wearing khaki military uniforms will participate.</p>
<p>The Rich Revel</p>
<p>Common People Inevitably Inferior</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 23rd] The world is at peace. Although the British people are sensitive to people of all countries, their first Christmas after the war does not seem to be able to restore the pre-war standard in terms of family gatherings and children's festivals. Some families have already made reservations in mid-November and will be provided by hotels and restaurants in the West End of London, with music and dancing all night long. However, most ordinary people have been reunited for the first time in seven years, and their family situation is inevitably slightly difficult. Some cannot prepare the firewood and coal needed to burn on Christmas Eve according to traditional customs. There are also quite a few people whose relatives are still overseas, serving in the military or have not returned. The food situation for children is slightly better than before. It is heard that 300,000 turkeys have arrived in the UK from South Ireland, and 3.5 million pounds of grapes have arrived in Haifa, Palestine. Australia has also promised to greatly increase the supply of eggs and will transport more tea, wheat, fresh meat, salted meat, ham, butter, coconut oil, sugar, trolley wine, and sweet wine. Besides food, the next most important thing for Christmas is gifts.</p>
<p>Gifts and Toys</p>
<p>Inferior Goods Supplied to the Market</p>
<p>However, this year's gifts are even scarcer than the six Christmases during the war. Some stores rely heavily on old goods, eager to sell on the one hand and eager to buy on the other. The most popular gifts in the past, such as handbags, handkerchiefs, cosmetic boxes, and coat hooks, are not easy to buy. Even gloves and handkerchiefs require sacrificing valuable ration coupons. Pont Street, the fashion center, has been damaged by bombs. Although some specialized products are still available, their value is very expensive. A piece of old jewelry costs as much as several thousand pounds. A department store has a special counter selling old prints, old maps, old nautical charts, and copperplate prints, with prices starting from one pound. Genuine and fake jewelry varies in value and size, with the lowest value being only seven shillings and sixpence. Playing cards are very difficult to buy, and children's toys are also very rare, expensive, and of poor quality. Wooden trains are crudely made and poorly painted, and are now displayed in the windows of major department stores. In the past, such inferior goods would never be displayed in prominent places. Some toys are just some rough pieces of wood loosely nailed together.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Plans to Develop Fisheries in the Far East; Shipyards in Vladivostok Rush to Build New Ships; Experts and Workers Move from West to East</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 24th] After the Soviet Union's lightning seven-day attack on Japan, it occupied southern Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands and is working hard to rebuild them. Fisheries have now been restored and expanded, factories are being built in rapid succession, and port facilities have also increased. Soviet experts and workers from western Soviet Union are moving to the new area. It is expected that the Soviet Union's Far East fishery harvest will double next year. When the Soviet army occupied, it discovered that natural resources had been exploited without regard for future losses, resulting in a significant loss of the richness of fisheries in the central and southern Kuril Islands. The largest and most complete facilities on the northern islands of the Kuril Islands have been heavily destroyed by American aircraft. In southern Sakhalin, the Japanese army adopted a scorched earth policy when retreating, leaving only rubble. Soviet sources reported that most of the large Japanese fishing boats in the northern Kuril Islands and Kamchatka had been taken away by the Japanese when they retreated, but the Soviet Union is now doing its best to restore them. Hundreds of advance teams of Soviet technicians and fishermen from the Caspian and Black Sea regions have arrived in the Kuril Islands and Sakhalin Island. Industries related to fisheries built by the Soviet Union in the Far East are now being expanded to meet this new demand. Shipyards in Vladivostok and other places are rushing to build new ships for fishing.</p>
<h3>Indian League Holds Emergency Meeting Yesterday; Accuses Britain of Not Changing its Traditional Policies; Wavell Will Meet Twenty Landowners Again Next Month</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 24th] The Central India Committee of the Indian League, Brandari, stated at an emergency meeting convened by the League yesterday that there can be no peace in Asia until foreign forces are completely driven out of Asia. The League's Secretary, Menon, said that the convening of this meeting shows our loyalty to the Congress Party and support for India's complete independence. The World War has not brought peace to India and Asia, and there is no hope of realizing peace unless foreign forces are completely driven out of Asia. The so-called socialist government of Britain is still the same as the style of Churchill and Amery. The recent statement by the Labor government has made the situation in India worse. Menon also said that Britain has no right to arrest Indian National Army personnel. We firmly oppose the authority of the British in India.</p>

<h3>American Newspapers Criticize Konoe's Memoirs</h3>
<p>The Warring Leader Cannot Deny Responsibility</p>
<p>Who Can Believe What He Writes?</p>
<p>[Associated Press, San Francisco, 23rd] California newspapers commented on Fumimaro Konoe's suicide and the statements in his posthumous memoirs, with much criticism. The McClatchy newspaper editorial said that Konoe made a final protest before taking poison, claiming that he worked for peace during his three years as prime minister. From a historical point of view, his words are difficult to establish. It would take more than a few months or years to understand the chaotic situation in Japan before the Japanese-American War. However, it is clear that the definite steps towards war were taken during Konoe's tenure as prime minister. Although Konoe had resigned on December 7, 1941, the bombs had already been made, and someone just needed to light the fuse. The invasion of China occurred during Konoe's tenure, and American protests were frankly rejected by Konoe. All efforts by third parties to mediate the Sino-Japanese War were also dismissed by Konoe. The Tripartite Pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan was also signed during Konoe's term as prime minister. On October 5, 1940, Konoe even arrogantly predicted, "If the United States does not understand the true meaning of the alliance between Japan, Germany, and Italy, to actively cooperate in creating a new world order, it will lead to war with the United States." These are not the words of a peace lover. Reviewing Japanese history from 1930 to 1940 cannot help but give the impression that when Konoe was not in office as prime minister, Japan's military aggression appeared to have slowed down. Therefore, Konoe's suicide does not seem to be due to great mental pain from being accused of being a war criminal, but rather because he knew that once he was interrogated and the history was published, even if he was not considered the mastermind of the war, he would be judged as one of Japan's war criminals. The San Francisco Chronicle commented that Konoe's posthumous works said that Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka knew of Germany's plan to invade the Soviet Union when he signed the Japanese-Soviet Neutrality Pact, which is not consistent with the facts. Hitler's news of the invasion of the Soviet Union made Matsuoka realize that he had been fooled, and Konoe was not unaware of it, so he resigned after leaving a variable. The Tripartite Pact signed on September 27, 1940, should be the responsibility of Konoe. Who should be held responsible for his handshake with Stalin on April 13, 1941, and Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union on June 22 of the same year? The Japanese people can know it themselves. If it is said that Matsuoka knew Hitler's intentions early on and threw himself into the trap, who can believe it? Moreover, Germany may not have been willing to tell its eastern ally about its plans. Germany's contempt for its eastern allies is obvious to all. According to U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew, he repeatedly ordered Matsuoka to refute the evidence that Germany deliberately deceived Japan. Although Matsuoka did not publicly do so, he may have made Konoe believe that his actions were intended to protect Japan's position.</p>

<h3>The Most Memorable Today!</h3>
<p>Today, December 25th, is the joyful Christmas festival. Apart from the rejoicing, the general public in China also remembers two great meanings.</p>
<p>The Republic of China was born in an era of turmoil and chaos. Not long after the declaration of a democratic polity, the ambitious Yuan Shikai wanted to uproot this young tree of democracy, newly planted in a garden of thorns. He wanted to plant the thorns of autocracy in its foundations, hoping that it would quickly spread throughout the garden. However, like a bolt of lightning, General Cai E raised the banner of righteousness in Yunnan, winning the unanimous response of people throughout the country who were inclined to democracy. Yuan Shikai, who was lying high on the dragon bed in Xinhua Palace, dreaming of the Hongxian Dynasty, finally awoke from his beautiful dream and ascended to heaven. This premature imperial movement also vanished with his imperial spirit. Therefore, we can say that December 25th symbolizes the spirit of struggle of democratic China.</p>
<p>After that, the Anhui clique, the Zhili clique, the Fengtian clique, and the major warlords fought each other in the Central Plains, and the small warlords in Sichuan and Fujian competed for territory. A situation of mixed warfare between large and small warlords plunged the common people into misery. The great Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, at that time as the principal of the Whampoa Military Academy, punished the wicked to comfort the people. He raised a benevolent and righteous army to overcome the rabble and sweep away the corrupt and dark forces. This aroused the jealousy of Japan, which was eyeing it covetously. They abandoned the gradual economic aggression and further adopted a whale-like military aggression, so there was the disturbance in Wanbaoshan and the sudden attack on Beidaying. In one night, the vast territory of Northeast China changed color. Chairman Chiang knew that our country's preparations were not yet sufficient at that time, and the time was not yet ripe, so he had to temporarily endure humiliation and work hard. At that time, the general shortsighted people, failed to understand Chairman Chiang's painstaking efforts and far-sighted plans. Instead, they made groundless accusations and acted recklessly, which eventually led to the reckless and fractured Xi'an Incident.</p>
<p>The Xi'an Incident was a major turning point in the rise and fall of the nation. Chairman Chiang went to Xi'an empty-handed, mediating between the rebellious armies with drawn swords and strung bows. His life was in imminent danger. The situation was so critical that the entire country was panicked and uneasy, as if suffering a severe disease. With Chairman Chiang's profound wisdom and strong courage, he finally came out of danger safely on this memorable day. Chairman Chiang's great personality of great benevolence and courage, after this trial of the incident, has since shown even more radiant splendor, winning the unanimous respect and support of the people of the whole country. From the initial outbreak of the war at Lugouqiao to the Japanese army accepting surrender in Zhijiang, after eight years of resistance war, the Chinese people's spirit was able to maintain unity and never waver. The appealing power of Chairman Chiang's handling of the Xi'an Incident was indeed a major driving force. On the ninth anniversary of Chairman Chiang's escape from danger in Xi'an, let us pay the highest tribute to this uniquely great leader! (Zhang Deqian)</p>
<h3>A Scenic Spot Warm in Winter and Cool in Summer: The Scenery of Hainan Island Remains as Before, and the Sea, Land, and Air Transportation Network is Being Actively Developed</h3>
<p>This is the scenery of Hainan Island five months after the Japanese surrendered.</p>
<p>From the airfield to Haikou – the capital of Hainan Island – you will see a strange sight: vehicles outside the city drive on the left, but within the city, the new regulation of "driving on the right" has already been implemented. This is the so-called gradual change. The roads of Hainan Island are very sound. This is probably because there are no heavy-tonnage vehicles. In the past few years, the enemy Japan has deliberately managed and妄想(wàngxiǎng) hoped to build Hainan Island into the strongest naval base in the Far East, so their first step was to rectify the island's transportation lines. This isolated island, 250 miles around, is interwoven with modern cement highways, allowing heavy-tonnage military vehicles to transport military supplies back and forth.</p>
<p>Four Major Airfields Strategically Located at Military Strongholds</p>
<p>A long and slender railway network connects the island's key points. On this circular island, two major lines intersect vertically. There are also four major airfields on the island, strategically located at military strongholds, with perfect equipment.</p>
<p>Now, times have changed. Most of the railway vehicles were damaged in this war. Coal is exhausted. The station parking lots are full of ruins. The locomotives are also rusted due to disuse, standing lifelessly. The width of the railway seems to be unsuitable for modern needs.</p>
<p>The scarcity of gasoline has paralyzed most of the highway transportation.</p>
<p>The prosperity of Hainan Island has always relied on imports and exports. However, there is no news of importing ships, the reason being the fear of hitting sea mines. The lack of ships is also an important reason. The wrecks of ships are scattered around the ports, currently impossible to salvage or repair.</p>
<p>Overseas Shipping: Qiong [Hainan] Overseas Chinese Believe it is a Blessing</p>
<p>To revive the victorious Hainan Island, the most important thing is, of course, the revival of commerce. At the same time, to restore commerce, it is necessary to restore transportation first, so that Hainan Island can connect with the outside world. Currently, Hainan Island is in a state of semi-isolation.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about maritime transportation: Before the war, maritime transport from Haikou to the outside world was very developed. At that time, there were regular航輪(hánglún) liners that regularly sailed to the ports along the coast of mainland South China, as well as to Tokyo, Vietnam, Singapore, Siam, the Philippines, etc., which was very convenient for passengers. When the Japanese invaded Haikou, it fell into a state of stagnation. Now that Qiongya is liberated, everything is showing a new phenomenon. The义民(yìmín) righteous people living in Guangzhou Bay are also buying boats and returning one after another. Shipping between Haikou and Guangzhou Bay has resumed. However, due to the inconvenience of transport ships, only帆船(fānchuán) sailing ships are temporarily operating, running once every two or three days. As for the speed, if the tide is favorable, it only takes 24 hours to arrive, and the round-trip fare is about 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. It is heard that the resumption of shipping to Hong Kong and Guangzhou is being planned, which is another blessing for the general public.</p>
<p>Land Transportation: Over a Thousand Kilometers in Total</p>
<p>Secondly, let’s talk about land transportation. Going back to what I was saying earlier, our Qiongya land transportation is quite developed, due to the completion of highways in various counties, and Haikou has also become the starting point for transportation, and a distribution center for local products and foreign goods. The types of vehicles include automobiles, rickshaws, horse-drawn carriages, and ox carts. According to statistics, there are a total of twenty-three環海(huánhǎi) around-the-sea and纵横(zònghéng) crisscrossing routes in the whole of Qiong, with a total road distance of 1,474 kilometers. The convenience of land transportation is evident. Later, it was renovated once more, and branch lines were added to villages and towns in various counties, which was even more convenient. What deserves our attention is the 175-kilometer-long railway from Sanya to Beili. However, due to the lack of coal, it is rarely used. Now that the enemy has surrendered, transportation is originally beneficial. However, on the west road, bandits appear from time to time, so it is still not possible to travel safely. The east road is relatively peaceful, and cars still operate as normal. However, because there are not many cars operating now, and the passengers are very crowded, there are almost twenty people in each car, and people are standing and sitting on the sides and roofs of the cars. The car owners only care about making money, completely disregarding the safety of the passengers. The current Qiongya authorities have already issued orders to ban this, in order to ensure the safety of the passengers. As for the fare, it has risen from 700 yuan to 5,000 yuan from Haikou to Jiaji, which makes the general passengers feel "unable to return home".</p>
<p>Utilizing Airfields: Aviation Business is Bound to Prosper</p>
<p>Speaking of aviation, there used to be Eurasia民機(mínjī) civil aviation, flying from Guangzhou via茂各(Mao Ge) to Haikou. After the Japanese army invaded, they expanded the original airfield in Haikou several times. Airfields were also added in Wenchang, Lingao, Jiaji, Changjiang, and Sanya, among which the Haikou airfield is the largest, followed by Sanya, and the equipment is quite complete. Currently, there are no civil airlines flying. We predict that once the above-mentioned airfields are utilized, the aviation industry will develop smoothly.</p>
<p>The sea, land, and air transportation of Qiongya are roughly as described above. Although it is currently inconvenient, there is no doubt that it will become more prosperous and convenient in the future due to the increase in land routes and airfields.</p>
<p>The main export goods are fruits, peanut oil, sugar, and coffee. The main import goods are rice and manufactured goods. The island produces very little rice and has always relied on French Vietnam. Currently, with transportation cut off, in the impression of outsiders, the islanders seem to be mostly vendors who make a living selling bananas.</p>
<p>Blue Sea and Yellow Sand: A Tropical Scenery</p>
<p>The city of Haikou seems to be蛰伏(zhéfú) dormant under the tropical sunlight. The trees are lush, and the palm trees sway in the breeze, fully expressing the scenery of the tropics. The azure sea water washes the yellow sand coastline,湧出(yǒngchū) surging up with white foam.</p>
<p>The island's commercial scope is extremely small, limited only to the island itself. The number of cars on the road is scarce. The standard of living is also very low. But on the surface, the islanders seem to be very satisfied with their lives.</p>
<p>Life on the island is indeed extremely 静穆(jìngmù) quiet and peaceful. There are many small cafes on the street corners. A cup of milk coffee costs 25 法币(fǎbì) yuan. The patrons of these cafes are mostly barefoot women who sit and chat, resting after work. The island is currently temporarily under martial law, and no passage is allowed after 10 pm every night. The streets are densely covered with armed sentries.</p>
<p>French Color Occupies the Dominance of the Whole City</p>
<p>The buildings here are deeply染着(rǎnzhe) imbued with French color. Most of the new buildings are Japanese-style. Although many Japanese have been detained in concentration camps in the suburbs, men and women can still be seen on the streets from time to time. The first to be repatriated are probably the 15,000 Chinese laborers who were forcibly conscripted by the enemy.</p>
<p>Catholicism occupies an overwhelming advantage on the island. The magnificent and clean Red Cross Hospital in the city, and many small schools, are all achievements of Catholicism. The Customs Office is the most modern building on the island, constructed quite exquisitely.</p>
<p>The damage from the air raids is limited to buildings such as ports and airports. There are no traces of past air raids in the city of Haikou.</p>
<p>The food problem on the island is not very serious at present. The rice reserves are gradually thinning, costing 25,000 法币(fǎbì) yuan per 祖(zǔ). The authorities are now working to revive relief efforts. Pictures of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Dr. Sun Yat-sen can be seen everywhere.</p>
<p>In the past, the island's fuel, the coal stored after the Japanese army surrendered, has now been used up, and the electricity has also been exhausted. Fortunately, the island has abundant forests. The fuel problem should not be a problem. At present, most islanders use oil lamps.</p>
<p>A Cold-Weather Haven: Hope Can Be Expected Soon</p>
<p>The islanders are threatened by snake diseases, but at the same time, snakes are a delicacy on the menu. Other delicacies from the mountains and seas are roasted dog meat and jellyfish, which taste quite like peanut butter.</p>
<p>This is a pleasant place that is warm in winter and cool in summer. In winter, even in the current month of December, the climate is only 75 degrees Fahrenheit, making people feel quite mild and comfortable, with absolutely no so-called cold waves.</p>
<p>In the near future, I think, Hainan Island may become the ideal cold-weather haven in our country. (Dawn)</p>
<h3>The U.S. Military in Tokyo, Translated by Our Editorial Office from the December Issue of Life Magazine</h3>
<p>The industrious Japanese people have swept away the ruins and rubble in Tokyo, the city most devastated by bombing. Various vehicles have also resumed operation on the streets of the modernized city center, part of which was not destroyed by the bombing. When the Japanese parliament prepares to hold a temporary general election meeting, it will summon 21 million women with the right to vote in Tokyo. They are a group that has obtained the right to vote for the first time. Of the 3 million troops stationed in the mainland, except for a small number of liaison troops without medals, all have been demobilized. The total number of Japanese troops abroad is still 6 million. General MacArthur lent Japan 100 tank landing craft, allowing 100,000 Japanese troops to be sent back home every month. The Japanese conscription system has been abolished by MacArthur, and MacArthur has also seized a huge sum of $250 million, which was secretly隐瞒(yǐnmán) hidden by the army and navy from the government. Japanese tourists have not been to Mount Fuji for five years, but now, the American flag is flying on its summit.</p>
<p>The Current State of Shintoism</p>
<p>Many people have not suffered wartime sacrifices because they have always had contact with the Japanese mainland. Some of them went to the mainland to躲避(duǒbì) escape the bombing. This winter, many people can still苟延残喘(gǒuyáncánchuǎn) eke out a living. They can run to the countryside, where the food is much more abundant than in the cities.</p>
<p>Japan is now defeated and is being strictly ruled by an American officer, but the Japanese are still the same as before. MacArthur has abolished Japanese Shintoism. It is not allowed to exist in schools, government shrines, or anywhere else. Only Shintoism related to individuals or families will not be interfered with. The Japanese still bow to their Shinto emperors and shrines. However, a certain Japanese法学专家(fǎxué zhuānjiā) legal expert made a surprising announcement: "The people of Japan do not believe that they are descendants of the sun god in Shintoism."</p>
<p>The Japanese emperor, who once launched the Palace韩(hán) Revolution to resist the warlord clique, has not gained any benefit now. His private property is estimated to be 10,000 million yuan, and he also has 3.2 million acres of land. Now, his assets, along with those of 67 male and female皇族(huángzú) royal family members, have been frozen. Now, his annual budget of 400,000 yuan has to be carefully核计(héjì) calculated by the Americans. The Japanese compensation amount may reach 3.3 million million yuan, and he may have to bear part of the responsibility for paying the compensation. However, Japan's annual revenue is only one percent of this huge amount.</p>
<p>Changes in the Lives of Japanese Police</p>
<p>The most significant and meaningful thing in Tokyo is the reform of the police profession. The Japanese police have always ruled the people by means of terror. The Japanese police, for those they want to arrest, only need to order him how to walk, how to turn, and how to automatically follow. The arrested person often obeys. The Japanese always bow to the police officers when asking for directions. Even now, they still do. Last week, the head of the U.S. Counterintelligence sharply criticized the Japanese police for not adopting恐怖(kǒngbù) terror methods and illegal confiscation behavior. In the eyes of the Americans, the behavior of the Japanese police also proves their rudeness, shamefulness, and immorality.</p>
<p>Women and Chocolate</p>
<p>It is easier for U.S. soldiers to solve their woman problems in Tokyo than anywhere else. This problem can often be solved smoothly in Hibiya Park, next to the Imperial Palace. The women who can be 对付(duìfù) dealt with are neither the司空见惯(sīkōngjiànguàn) common geishas nor the 俯拾即是(fǔshíjíshì) readily available maids or prostitutes, but 脱离(tuōlí) women from families. Their routine work is to teach them some necessary English and give them something to eat, such as chocolate and fruit, which is enough to deal with them. So far, Japanese men still have angry expressions towards this behavior.</p>
<p>The U.S. government's blunder in stipulating the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen has brought U.S. soldiers to the brink of personal bankruptcy. The salaries of U.S. soldiers are issued according to the stipulation of 15车(chē) per one (that is, one Japanese yen equals six and a half cents U.S.). However, the black market exchange rate, because the Japanese currency膨涨(péngzhǎng) inflated from 27 million million to 44 million million yuan in four months, one U.S. dollar can be exchanged for 70 Japanese yuan. An American soldier needs 20 U.S. dollars to spend a nightlife without alcohol.</p>
<p>The Prevalence of New American Dances</p>
<p>People in the military can travel for free and buy souvenirs in the department stores run by the U.S. military. Their best asset is cigarettes. If they can pass the interference of the military police, each pack of cigarettes can be exchanged for two U.S. dollars. Some of the Japanese brothels are allowed to exist. The dancers in Tokyo have learned the new American dance (Jitterbug), but they are闹着(nàozhe) threatening to strike, saying that the price they pay for dancing the new dance, just a plate of sweet potatoes, is not enough. General Arthur Bullett has planned a vast sports program, including baseball, football, ice skating, and hockey, to solve the entertainment problem for the U.S. military.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Tokyo in Winter</p>
<p>250,000 people in Tokyo live in茅房陋屋(máofáng lòuwū) shacks and huts, and tens of thousands of people still have no houses to live in. They all sleep in the parks. This winter, rice will also be insufficient. The black market has risen to four yuan two and a half cents U.S. per pound (calculated at the pre-war exchange rate). In 1941, the price of rice was four cents U.S. per pound. Japanese officials claim that 8 million people will freeze and starve to death. The U.S. authorities believe that this number is exaggerated, but the high mortality rate is inevitable.</p>
<p>To pay for the import of food, Emperor Hirohito plans to auction off his pearl treasure worth 4 million U.S. dollars. The United States forces the Japanese to redistribute the arable land, selling one-third of the ownerless耕地(gēngdì) arable land in Japan to tenant farmers for cultivation. Although this method can help with the distribution of future wealth, there is really no wealth to分肥(fēnféi) distribute this winter. As a result of the air bombing, only 25% of Japan's large industry remains. The number of unemployed people reaches 10 million!</p>
<p>Under these circumstances,民间的(mínjiān de) popular dissatisfaction and lack of rest are difficult to avoid. Among the 36 political parties in Japan, the most organized and well-organized is the humble Communist Party. The Japanese Communist Party has no connection with Moscow. It is the only political party in Japan that requires the废置(fèizhì) abolition of the Japanese Emperor. Even so, they still need to seek liberation from tradition, because when a female Communist份子(fènzǐ) member expressed her opinion on Japan, she was still crying.</p>
<p>The vagrants sleeping on the park benches are living the lives of beggars and thieves.</p>
<p>When the demobilized Japanese soldiers visit the Tokyo Shrine, the U.S. military sends troops to guard and prohibits the U.S. military from approaching.</p>
<p>In Hibiya Park, U.S. soldiers and Japanese women sit and chat by the lake, looking across to the huge building of MacArthur's headquarters.</p>
<p>American Women Study Industrial Design and Modeling</p>
<p>In the United States before the war, household furniture and equipment were mostly designed and modeled by men. Nowadays, more and more women are engaged in this新兴(xīnxīng) emerging industrial design and modeling industry.</p>
<p>The picture shows the situation of American women practicing in the industrial design and modeling department of the American Academy of Arts in Chicago. In the past four years, the increase rate of the number of female students trained in the school has exceeded 75%. Students in the modeling department first receive simple art modeling training and gradually learn formal operations. The girl in the picture is装(zhuāng) installing a part of the chair handle with an iron drill.</p>
<h3>The Base for Asian Industrialization: New Development in the Northeast</h3>
<p>The industrial empire established by Japan in the Northeast will be inherited by China. This property should be considered as part of the compensation for Japan's invasion of China, and it is also enough to open up an opportunity for China to begin industrialization. The Northeast industry has had hundreds of thousands of millions of yuan invested by Japan. At this moment, the steel, chemical, machinery, synthetic gasoline, wood, and other industries have not suffered serious damage from the war. This time, China will receive it without paying any 代价(dàijià) price to Japan, because most of the ownership of the industry was originally in the companies operated by the Japanese government. The United States is paying close attention to the transfer of industry in the Northeast, for the following reasons:</p>
<p>After China receives the industry in the Northeast, the management work done by the Japanese will definitely be transferred to the hands of the Chinese. Therefore, perhaps American managers and engineers will be called upon to assist in the management. At the same time, how to raise funds, whether the management or China transfers it to any individual or company, is also a problem. Perhaps China will hope for American investment. Furthermore, the market for the products of this new industry is a basic issue. Perhaps American economists will be hired to design the best way for China to make money from the industry in the Northeast.</p>
<p>There is a rather complex factor here. The Soviet Union enjoys half the sovereignty over the South Manchurian Railway (according to the Sino-Soviet Treaty, the Changchun Railway is jointly operated by China and the Soviet Union), and it may demand to share ownership of the industry in the Northeast owned by the Railway Bureau. The Railway Bureau has mines, factories, shipping, telephones, telegraphs, and many other industries. The industry in the Northeast should be developed謹愼(jǐnshèn) cautiously.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Shadow of Japan's Democratization</h3>
<p>It has been just over three months since General MacArthur, as Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers, occupied Japan. With a composed demeanor, he has gradually unfolded measures to deal with post-war Japan. These include the phased arrest of war criminals, the dissolution of zaibatsu (financial conglomerates), the improvement of the relationship between individual farmers and the land, and the separation of Shintoism from the state. Some of these are directly related to settling wartime responsibilities, while others lay a good foundation for a new democratic Japan. In such a short period, achieving such results, we cannot but deeply admire General MacArthur's outstanding talent. Yesterday, the Associated Press and United Press International reported from Tokyo that MacArthur's headquarters claimed that the groundwork for building a new Japan had been completed, and that Japan's ancient feudal structure had been eradicated. Whether this report is reliable is questionable. Even if it were true, it could only be considered an unofficial observation from MacArthur's headquarters. In the process of Japan's democratization, the imperial family, which currently represents the highest institution of Japan's feudal system, still exists. We cannot hastily conclude that "Japan's ancient feudal structure has been eradicated" simply because of the improvement in the relationship between individual farmers and the land, the dissolution of zaibatsu, or even the separation of Shintoism from the state. Because the Japanese imperial family is the center of Japan's feudal system; if the emperor is not removed, how can it be said that the feudal structure has been eradicated?</p>
<p>Regarding the question of whether to retain or abolish the Japanese imperial family, opinions currently seem to be divided. Qualified observers of Japanese affairs either advocate abolition or advocate retention, each with their own reasons. Generally, conservative figures in Britain tend to believe that the Japanese imperial family is the center of the people's reverence, but in fact, it is merely a puppet and does not directly participate in politics. It should be retained so that a democratic system can be gradually established with the imperial family as the center. This is originally the view of British "realists." They believe that if the Japanese imperial family were abolished, the entire country might fall into anarchy. This argument seems to be quite influential in the United States as well. However, in both Britain and the United States, there are also some people who argue that the Japanese imperial family should be abolished immediately, and that a new democratic Japan should not allow the existence of an emperor. The general sentiment in China is that the Japanese imperial family should be abolished; although the Chinese government, to this day, has never issued an official statement on the question of whether to retain or abolish the Japanese imperial family.</p>
<p>Currently, the handling of the Japanese imperial family issue is stagnating at this stage. The Potsdam Declaration did not explicitly mention the Japanese imperial family issue; Japan proposed conditions when accepting the Potsdam Declaration, requesting the retention of the imperial family; but President Truman's reply did not accept Japan's conditions, only stating that the Japanese imperial family must be subject to the control of the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers. The major Allied powers only have passive consensus on dealing with the Japanese imperial family issue, and have not yet achieved active coordination. This situation should not be allowed to drag on like this!</p>
<p>We believe that in the process of Japan's democratization, the imperial system must be eliminated and cannot be allowed to exist again. Although Tokyo dispatches claim that senior officials at MacArthur's headquarters hinted that if the Emperor could have the wisdom to solve the rice shortage and unemployment problems, and follow the democratic system implemented by MacArthur in Japan, so that the Japanese people could obtain a rational and perfect government, then the Emperor and his system could be permanently maintained, and Emperor Hirohito himself hoped that the matter of abdication would be decided by the Japanese people. However, the retention or abolition of the Japanese imperial family is now not merely a domestic issue for Japan, which can be decided by the Japanese people themselves, but an international issue that should be decided by the United Nations. We should not forget! It must be known that Tojo and Konoe both received the Emperor's "great command" to form the government. From a legal point of view, the Japanese Emperor is the biggest war criminal in this war of aggression. Whether in terms of aggression against China or in terms of Britain and the United States, he should bear full responsibility for launching World War II. Now that the war is over, we should first eradicate this evil system that not only harms the Japanese people but also destroys world peace. The Japanese imperial family and the British royal family are originally two fundamentally different systems. The formation of the British government is determined by public opinion, and the King is not responsible for actually organizing the government. However, the emergence of Tojo and Konoe in Japan to form the government was not due to the support of the Diet, but because they received the "great command." Moreover, the army and navy directly received orders from the Japanese Emperor, and the cabinet had no right to intervene. Therefore, the Japanese Emperor is directly responsible for politics. We cannot regard the Japanese Emperor and the British King as the same. The Japanese imperial family was the supreme commander of this war. Regardless of the current intentions of the Chinese government, the Chinese people have the right to point out that the Japanese imperial family is the chief culprit of Japanese war criminals, and demand that the imperial system be abolished in the construction of a new post-war Japan.</p>
<p>From the standpoint of the United Nations, having mobilized the power of the four countries of China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union to defeat the enemy, allowing the imperial system to continue to exist would only plant the seeds of future disasters. The Japanese people's psychology has always harbored deep Shinto superstitions, believing that they are God's chosen people and that they have a sacred mission to rule the world. It was for this mission that they launched the "Greater East Asia War." Although their self-proclaimed "Greater East Asia War" was defeated, if the imperial system is allowed to exist, it may give the Japanese people the illusion that their "sacred mission" has only suffered a temporary setback and still awaits future completion. If the power of China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union is concentrated and still unable to eradicate the imperial system, it will make the Japanese people even more believe that their imperial family is "ordained by heaven," increasing their arrogance and becoming a scourge to the world again. General MacArthur's separation of Japanese Shintoism from the state was originally an extremely wise measure, but if the "god" among Shinto believers is still allowed to exist, allowing it to be the ruler of Japanese politics, then future Japan may still not be a democratic Japan, but still a "god"-ruled Japan, a "Hakkō ichiu" (all the world under one roof) Emperor's Japan. This is truly a hidden worry for world peace!</p>
<p>For the sake of lasting world peace and for the benefit of the Japanese people, the existence of the imperial system is ultimately a shadow on Japan's democratization. We should dispel this shadow, and then the world and Japan can obtain light.</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Buyers Come One After Another, Gold Market Soars Again, U.S. Dollar Also Rises Gradually</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market sentiment continued to be strong. With a large amount of U.S. dollars being snapped up by manufacturers and importers, the U.S. dollar gradually rose, stimulating the gold market. Many speculators in the stock market sold their stocks to buy gold, gradually forcing a short squeeze situation. From the initial price of 768,000 in the morning, buyers came one after another. With demand exceeding supply, the price broke through the 800,000 mark at noon, and finally hovered around 810,000, an increase of 52,000 compared to last Saturday. General public opinion advocated that the exchange rate should not be too high (below the market price), and general sentiment also changed its old view, resulting in even greater demand for gold and U.S. dollars. The prospect is likely to be good. Gold jewelry shops quoted 860,000, silver bullion was 600 yuan, and silver coins were still hovering around 450 yuan. Although demand for gray market transactions was strong, supply also surged, and it remained between 8 fen and 1 jiao.</p>
<p>The U.S. dollar strengthened due to the firm market sentiment in the wartime capital, coupled with rumors that a large number of free commercial ships arrived this morning. With yarn factories and importers rushing to snap up, the supply of funds became visibly depleted. From the low opening price of 1,280 yuan in the morning, the market improved steadily. After breaking through the 1,300 yuan mark, the situation became even firmer, and factory demand surged even more. Speculators were forced to sell at high prices, so they rushed to buy back at noon. The afternoon was even more brisk. Finally, there was still strong demand at the price of 1,380 yuan, an increase of more than 120 yuan compared to last Saturday. Hong Kong dollar also stabilized accordingly. As a result, old currency rose by 5 yuan, and new currency rose by 3 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Sharpness of Chinese Stocks Has Diminished, Public Debt Gradually Declines, Foreign Stocks' Rise Has Not Yet Subsided</h3>
<p>Public debt was lacking in demand due to speculators' interest turning to stocks. Category C debt immediately broke into 700 yuan on the opening and then fell to below 650 yuan. Retail investors still tried to make a show of strength, and although there was a pullback in the middle, it failed to break out of the 700 yuan mark. At noon, it still fell to around 640 yuan due to more selling pressure. As a result, it continued to fall by 55 yuan to 90 yuan compared to last Saturday. The price difference between miscellaneous brands was therefore narrowing, and the market situation was very dull.</p>
<p>Chinese stocks initially felt a little disappointed because the Securities Association meeting the day before was not smooth. Many major investors sold their stocks to exchange for gold, forming a situation of supply exceeding demand. Yarn factories fell from 740 yuan to 690 yuan, and Mei Ya fell from 570 yuan to below 480 yuan. Later, the gold market's rise stimulated the market, and major speculators in the stock market still came to absorb them. Finally, the price rebounded to above 500 yuan and 700 yuan, and the situation was still firm, but the supply of funds was not very tight (observing that the price ratio of yarn factories to gold was more than 1,500 shares on the 15th of this month, but only a little over 1,000 shares are needed this morning). As a result, compared to last Saturday, the large-cap stock Yarn Factory rose slightly, Mei Ya fell slightly, and the small-cap stocks Xin Guang, Ping Jingfu, and Quan Xing each rose by 1.5 yuan. Unpopular old stocks were still being snapped up by strong players, and they soared endlessly.</p>
<p>The hot foreign stocks were relatively stable, with demand and supply being evenly matched, and the entire market was just hovering. Guest speculators and securities speculators still absorbed them at low prices. As a result, Jardine Matheson rose by another 100 yuan, Jardine Brewery and Paper both rose by 30 yuan, and the remaining unpopular stocks were slightly inferior.</p>
<p>Yarn and Thread Rise with Gold Price</p>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market was relatively stable. Due to the frequent reports of high gold prices, various yarns and threads rose by about 10,000 yuan. Although the Sichuan speculators had a good appetite for old brands of heavyweight goods such as 20-count special double horse and golden rooster, rising to 650,000, other 20-count yarns and threads were being sold, with not many transactions. The same trade of 16-count yarn was still not lonely, and the market sentiment was not very prosperous, and the foothold seemed to be unstable.</p>
<h3>White Coal Blocks Rise Again, Charcoal Market Mixed</h3>
<p>White coal lumps were in great demand and saw high prices again. White coal dust and coal briquettes were allocated to factories at parity prices, and demand turned dull, with prices slightly weakening. Anthracite dust transactions were sluggish, and the market was flat and soft. Fewer firewood boats arrived than before, and prices were slightly firmer. The supply of charcoal was still surging, and the market seemed to be slightly weaker.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Allied ship arrived from Tianjin with 700 tons of coal, and the Zhongshan cargo ship, managed by the American President Lines, arrived from Qinhuangdao with 9,000 tons, arriving in Shanghai at about 3 pm yesterday and docking at the Puxi Blue Funnel Wharf.</p>
<h3>Rice Falls, Oil Rises</h3>
<p>Soybeans and Bean Cakes Are Popular</p>
<p>The rice market's digestion was light, with japonica and indica falling by an average of 200 to 300 yuan. For white rice, 300 to 500 bags of goods from Danyang were shipped to Shanghai, and 200 to 300 bags were also shipped to Shanghai by river. The Qingdao speculators temporarily stopped, and the market fell back by 600 to 700 yuan. Flour from the Beiyang region was selling very well, rising by another 200 yuan, and the situation was trending upward. The oil market continued to be strong due to continued imports from Ningbo and Zhoushan, rising by several hundred to a thousand yuan.

<h3>Allied Ship Arrives, Loads of Northern Goods, Seafood Has Mixed Rise and Fall</h3>
<p>The Allied ship that sailed to Tianjin to load goods has arrived, loading more than 400 pieces of tobacco leaves, walnuts, red dates, and miscellaneous goods.</p>
<p>It was heard yesterday that Jian speculators had more than ten boxes of Shima sun-dried longan pulp arriving, which is the first time it has been offered here.</p>
<p>The price of Xuzhou daylily seemed to rise slightly due to the low production, while Fujian and Guangdong had good sales.</p>

Due to the Hong Kong speculators' procurement, the price of winter mushrooms rose again, and it was also the season (New Year's dishes). Many dried bamboo shoots arrived, and sales are waiting to be developed.</p>
<h3>Revival of Dyeing and Weaving Factories Can Be Expected</h3>
<p>Small and medium-sized dyeing and weaving factories were severely restricted by enemy and puppet controlled electricity before the victory of the War of Resistance. Since the Ministry of Economic Affairs stipulated the electricity consumption for production, there were no restrictions in order to encourage production, so they have successively connected to electricity and started work. The Longhai Line, Sichuan, and Yangtze speculators have started, and the dyeing of various factories is extremely busy, and it is expected that the dyeing and weaving industry will be revived.</p>
<h3>Four Banks and Two Bureaus Open as Usual Today</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] Today is National Rejuvenation Day and the Yunnan Uprising Memorial. The member banks of the city's Bankers Association will be closed for one day as usual. However, the four banks of China, Central, Communications, and Farmers, and the two bureaus of China Trust and Postal Remittances in the city, were ordered by the Office of the Special Commissioner for Finance and Banking of the Ministry of Finance in the Beijing-Shanghai area to remain open as usual, according to the practice in Chongqing. There will be no changes in commercial banks. In addition, Chen Hangshi, the Financial Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Finance in the Beijing-Shanghai area, returned to Shanghai yesterday after going to Beijing to visit Chairman Jiang to report on his work.</p>
<h3>Opinions on Book Funds, Chamber of Commerce Still Discussing</h3>
<p>[Special Report from this newspaper] The issue of converting the face value of puppet currency into industrial and commercial capital has been discussed separately by the Association of Accountants, the Chamber of Commerce, and various experts, and there is still no concrete method. The Industrial and Commercial Laws and Regulations Research Committee organized by the Chamber of Commerce has set up a subcommittee to study the matter. It is generally believed that the method of redeeming puppet currency at a rate of two hundred for one is not suitable for the conversion of book capital, and there is no other equivalent standard that can be promoted. A few days ago, opinions were solicited from various industry associations in separate letters in order to summarize them and then formulate standards to recommend to the competent authorities. In recent days, various industry associations have sent their opinion books to the Chamber of Commerce. It is heard that the Chamber of Commerce is still seriously discussing this issue. According to the persons in charge of the dyeing and weaving industry and the cotton cloth industry association, the three methods assumed by the former Association of Accountants are still worth approving. However, if the government also needs to strictly levy income tax and profit tax on the hypothetical surplus obtained after the conversion of the book capital amount, it is tantamount to a virtual account and actual tax levy, which the city's industry and commerce cannot tolerate. Therefore, it is advocated to suggest to the government that the tax revenue should be flexibly handled in order to avoid the operator being too worried when calculating the amount of book capital.</p>
<h3>Economic Briefs</h3>
<p>The registration fee that should be paid when registering industry and commerce should be directly handed over to the city treasury. It is known that the Social Bureau, in order to reduce the people filling out the forms from running back and forth, has consulted the Finance Bureau to ask the treasury to send personnel to the bureau to collect the fee, and the Finance Bureau has agreed to do so.</p>
<p>The Municipal Carpenter and Plumbing Workers' Union plans to increase wages again due to difficult living conditions. The carpenter's wages are 1,150 yuan per day, and the plumber's wages are 1,100 yuan per day. It is not enough to eat. It is scheduled to be implemented from New Year's Day next year.</p>
<p>The Yongsheng ship sailed to Hong Kong this afternoon. In addition to carrying 11,200 bags of flour, which are relief supplies, there are more than 1,100 pieces of commercial goods of preserved eggs, hundreds of packages of red dates, and Chinese medicinal materials in large quantities.</p>
<p>The Fuel Management Committee has approved the allocation of a portion of coal dust to various mechanized coal briquette factories at parity prices, and distribution should begin in the next few days.</p>
<p>The market price of knitwear has increased yesterday due to the eager search for guest speculators and the rise in gold prices.</p>
<h3>Sugar Industry's Stored Sugar Changes Sales Method, Allocation Ends Before January 15</h3>
<p>[Special Report from this newspaper] The city's sugar industry has 6,000 to 7,000 bags of sugar in stock after the victory, which are wholly owned by Chinese merchants and are not enemy or puppet materials. It voluntarily submitted a request to the Social Bureau for approval to sell them at parity prices to meet the market. The bureau approved the price and the method of universal sale and allowed it to be handled accordingly. The highest price was 400 yuan, and the rest decreased in order. The matter was still before February. There was a strange shortage of inventory in the market, and the market price was as high as 600 to 700 yuan, and there was no stock available. After the news was revealed, the general users were very much looking forward to it. However, the above-mentioned sugar was stored in the Zhongfu warehouse, and the warehouse was sealed due to the salt relationship, and the request was transferred for more than a month, and it could not be delivered as scheduled. At that time, sugar had arrived, and the selling price fell. The Enemy Property Handling Bureau also issued the sugar it had disposed of to the association for universal retail, and the market price became more and more unsustainable. Recently, the above-mentioned stored sugar can be unsealed, and Zheng Yizhou and others from the association submitted another request to the Social Bureau, requesting a change in the method to supply users. Roughly (1) The sugar originally scheduled to be sold at parity to food households, totaling 2,700 piculs, will be sold proportionally to the users who registered before, according to their last allocation. (2) The sugar originally scheduled to be sold at parity to various institutions, hospitals, and pharmacies, totaling 1,200 piculs, will be allowed to be included in the above-mentioned handling if the institutions do not need it. (3) The selling price will be determined according to the types and proportions of the first phase of the parity sale of the enemy and puppet property handling bureau. (4) 2,300 piculs of brown sugar will be returned to the various firms for their own sale. The above-mentioned methods have been approved by the Social Bureau. In addition to the sugar allocated to hospitals, pharmacies, and retailers, the association will notify them separately. The sugar allocated to institutions and groups, totaling 1,200 piculs, must be paid and purchased from the association before January 15. If there is a surplus after the deadline, it will be sold by the association separately.</p>

<h3>Christmas Charity Football Match: Donghua's New Lineup to Face the British Navy</h3>

<h3>Chinese Woodcut Exhibition to Be Held in London</h3>
<p>[British Information Service, London, December 24] Thanks to the cooperation between the British Parliament and the Chinese News Reporting Department, a Chinese woodcut exhibition will soon be held in London. The purpose of this exhibition is to allow the British art community to understand the significance of Chinese woodcuts during the war and how Chinese woodcuts maintain their artistic value in difficult circumstances. These woodcuts were collected by the Chongqing Woodcut Art Association. Most woodcut artists do not make woodcuts as a profession but only take woodcuts as a pastime. The woodcuts represent the reality of Chinese life, so this exhibition has profound significance in culture, art, and education.</p>
<h3>The Cradle of Chinese Library Talents: Wuchang Wen Hua Library Science School Establishes a New Fortress on the North Bank of the Jialing River in Chongqing</h3>
<p>"Private Wuchang Wen Hua Library Science School" is not an entirely unfamiliar name. Whether in the north or south of the Yangtze River, everyone knows "Wen Hua" when it is mentioned. It and its predecessor, Wuchang Wen Hua University, have had brilliant records in Chinese education, cultivating many talents for China. Its reputation abroad is valued as much as "Tsinghua" and "St. John's," considered the only authoritative and long-standing training institution for library talents in China. Today, most people engaged in library work are directly or indirectly from the "Wen Hua" cradle.</p>
<p>Withdrawing West with the Army</p>
<p>After the War of Resistance, "Wen Hua" moved west with the army, relocating from Wuchang to Chongqing. It found some houses in the Qiujing Middle School campus in Zengjiayan to continue classes. Unfortunately, in the summer of 1941, it was destroyed by enemy planes, and it had to find another location. Finally, through the efforts of teachers and students, a new fortress was established on the north bank of the Jialing River, near a sparsely populated town, in less than a year.</p>
<p>Liao Family Garden is a small garden that has been desolate for a long time. Through continuous management and cultivation for three years, it has become a beautiful small world. On a green triangular piece of land, there are three to five houses. All kinds of flowers and plants welcome tourists from far and near throughout the year, such as peach and plum blossoms in spring, oleanders in summer, osmanthus and chrysanthemums in autumn, and winter plum blossoms in winter, making this small world always dressed up, standing out among the mountains north of the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>Gradual Expansion</p>
<p>When they first arrived at Liao Garden, there was only one house. Classes, meals, meetings, and sleeping all took place there. In the past three years, houses have been built one after another, and today, they are sufficient for use. The spacious auditorium, large library, and comfortable classrooms and bedrooms allow students to grow up in a stable life. Recently, electric lights have been added, making this small garden even more colorful. Every night, looking from afar, the lights are woven into a beautiful night scene. The students are able to continue their studies in peace today, thanks first and foremost to the old principal, Mr. Shen Zurong. He is a wise leader with a spirit of struggle and extraordinary perseverance!</p>
<p>Internal Departments</p>
<p>The school is now divided into two departments: Library Science and Archives Management. Including the two new classes recruited this summer, there are only five classes with a total of seventy students. They are all enthusiastic young people from various provinces who have received education above high school and have great confidence in these two emerging subjects. They must study practical theory and technology in school for two years. Such as: Library Management Law, Administration, Chinese and Western Cataloging, Chinese and Western Bibliography, Classification, Various Classification Methods, Ordering Methods, Reference Work, Reference Books, Serials, Indexing, Character Retrieval, Archives Management and Administration, Archives Cataloging, Chinese and Western Archival Studies, Data Management, Historical Document Organization, Personnel Management, Official Document Research, Typing, Internships... and overviews of various subjects, Chinese, English, Second Foreign Language (German, Japanese, French). Within two years, they must complete one hundred credits. Before graduation, they must submit a graduation thesis, which must be approved by the faculty before they can graduate.</p>
<p>Expert Teachers</p>
<p>The school's professors for specialized subjects are all authoritative library scientists and archives experts in China. Last year, Li Yongquan was hired to teach Museum Science. This year, Lu Huashen and Li Yongzeng were hired to teach Library Management Law and Administration, Selection, and other subjects, which shows that the school authorities, even in the face of extreme economic difficulties, are still constantly recruiting good teachers to strengthen the lineup.</p>
<p>In addition to specialized courses, the school authorities also pay close attention to students' foreign language learning. For example, the English Speaking Society is organized to enable students to use what they have learned in practice, to correct their pronunciation, tone, posture, and habit errors, develop habits, and gradually lead them to the right path. Several courses, such as cataloging, reference books, bibliography, and archival science, also use original books and are taught in English. Also, such as screening microfilm reading, etc., to train their audio-visual abilities. All these facilities can promote the students' long-term progress.</p>
<p>Adding New Books</p>
<p>The library seems to be more active in this library science school. In addition to being busy collecting materials for professors and helping students choose reference books and answer questions all day long, it must also do a job, set an example, so it has one more responsibility than ordinary libraries. Under the principle of independent funding, new books from the painting gallery flow in continuously and circulate without stopping, like the sun's movement, so that every reader has the right and opportunity to quickly enjoy new books. Recently, the British and American embassies have donated many books, and the American Library Association and various library science schools have also donated a large number of books to the school, which will further increase the efficiency of the school's library.</p>
<p>The school has a research department for the study of library science and archival science. In the past eight years, it can be said that it has not stopped for a moment. There have been many new discoveries and creations. Unfortunately, due to the difficulty of wartime resources, it is impossible to print and publish them for reference by the library community. Now that the War of Resistance has ended in victory, they are preparing to work hard in this area, and in the near future, they will make a contribution. The person in charge now is Professor Xu Jialin, who has a master's degree in library science from the United States.</p>
<p>Returning to Wuchang</p>
<p>Restoration is the most urgent thing at present. As President Chiang said, restoration is not recovery. It is said that "Wen Hua" will not only move back to Wuchang, but also expand into a college and establish a demonstration library, always walking ahead of people, assisting in leading the development of Chinese library science. However, there are too many needs and too few talents in the large China. In order to train talents, in order to build libraries that need talents, more senior talents and teachers are needed. It is said that the British and American library communities have set up graduate student quotas to help China's library construction for the further study of Chinese library scholars. The relevant authorities in China have also noticed this and will gradually select library science students to study abroad in recent years. Associate Professor Xu Jiabi of the school went abroad to England at the beginning of last month to study British library science and will also go to the United States to study library science education.</p>

<p>Measures for Returning Heaters Decided</p>
<p>Since the bureau handled the registration for the return of heating equipment, the number of requests for return or allocation has been very large, but the number actually found is limited. It is not possible to confirm each one due to time constraints. Therefore, the bureau has decided on three principles for handling heaters: (1) All heaters that have been thoroughly reviewed by the handling bureau and found to be without any doubt will be returned to the original owner. (2) The heaters needed by the US military will be temporarily borrowed during the period when property rights have not been determined.

There has been a great deal of enthusiasm for industrial and commercial firms to apply for and register. The number of newly established firms registering is particularly large. The previously scheduled fines for late payment have been temporarily suspended in view of the hardships faced by the industrial and commercial sectors. The official also said that this registration does not include companies established in accordance with the Company Law, because company registration is handled by the central government according to law, while the registration of industrial and commercial firms belongs to the municipal government, and the fees collected during registration are legal fees of the municipal government.</p>
<h3>Streetcar Company Labor Dispute Continues to Be Mediated</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The workers of the British-owned Electric Military Company launched a labor strike due to demands for increased wages. Yesterday, the Social Affairs Bureau continued to mediate. The workers demanded the publication of the salaries of all employees. The company's general manager, White Lock, immediately announced them yesterday morning. According to the company authorities, the salary calculation is based on the cost of living index of 966 times the base salary approved by the Social Affairs Bureau, plus rice allowance, so it is very reasonable. It is learned that the base salary of the street cleaners and coppersmiths in the rolling stock department is the lowest, ranging from five to seven cents per day, and there are also new apprentices who are not satisfied with less than 10,000 yuan.

Each ship can carry 1,000 people each time, and on average, there should be two ships arriving in Shanghai every day.

They pulled out firearms, intimidated the occupants and servants, and extensively searched the premises, robbing a large quantity of jewelry, including gold bracelets, gold lockets, diamond rings, and gold rings. They fled with the loot, leaving no trace. Afterwards, the victim reported the incident to the Xin Cheng Precinct, which has jurisdiction. Chief He immediately dispatched a large number of police officers to patrol and search the area, but the robbers had already fled far away.</p>
<p>Hiding in a Nunnery, Police Surrounded the Area</p>
<p>Shortly before 11:30, the precinct received a tip that the robbers in the case were hiding in Yuanjue Nunnery, 266 Nong, Carter Road, Xinzha Road, Tongshentang. Deputy Chief Chen personally led thirty to forty armed police officers in police cars to the scene. They first surrounded the nunnery, and the police officers bravely rushed in. At this time, the robbers inside, hearing the news, each grabbed firearms and attempted to break out of the encirclement, firing shots to resist arrest.</p>
<p>Fierce Gunfight Results in Two Robbers Dead</p>

<h3>Rejoicing on Christmas Day, Remember the Displaced</h3>
<p>--A Report from Our Correspondent Jie</p>
<p>We are all new people, growing in every corner of Shanghai, decadent, corrupt, dark, and fallen. We must heroically repay this corrupt life! Comrades, quickly exercise your minds and bodies today, for we will be useful pillars of the nation tomorrow! Wake up! Wake up! Let's all go to classrooms and factories, and take integrity, righteousness, honesty, and honor as our standards of learning. We will sweep away decadence, corruption, darkness, and depravity at work! Comrades! Let's work hard! We are all new people, the strength to build a new China!</p>
<p>In this enthusiastic and magnificent singing, we saw nearly a thousand refugees and orphans in urgent need of relief from social philanthropists, which moved me very much! On Christmas Eve, the first Christmas after the victory against Japan, all of Shanghai was immersed in a whirlpool of revelry—perhaps unaware that in an extremely quiet corner of the city, the Shanghai Relief Home for Refugees and Orphans in Caohejing was also holding a Christmas celebration party. But there were still more than forty poor compatriots sleeping on hospital beds, with no one to sympathize with, pity, or help!</p>
<p>The eight years of war may have fostered a cruel heart in people. Although this tragic reality once shocked them, it passed like flowing water and smoke, becoming the past and fading into oblivion. Seeing the grand hotels, dance halls, and theaters crowded with dignitaries and guests, with scenes of extravagance and indulgence, contrasted sharply with the corpses lying on the street corners, reminding us of the ancient poem "Behind the vermilion gates, meat and wine go to waste, while on the road lie frozen corpses." Whose responsibility is this?</p>
<p>Many people only have hatred, disgust, and contempt for so-called vagrants, beggars, petty thieves, and the like, but no sympathy, compassion, or pity. This corner of humanity is forever abandoned by society, living a miserable and inhuman life. Humans are, after all, the spirit of all things, great and benevolent. If they had not lost their nature, no one should despise their tragic encounters. I can say with certainty: their becoming social scum is not their sin, nor is it their responsibility!</p>
<p>The Shanghai Relief Home for Refugees and Orphans was formerly the Liumin Xiqin Institute, run by the World Red Swastika Society. During the puppet regime, it was renamed the "Labor Camp." After the victory, it became a barracks for the National Army, covering an area of ​​more than 97 acres. On October 26, the Bureau of Social Affairs took over the command. On November 1, it officially began to accommodate refugees and orphans in Shanghai. In a short period, they mobilized their own forces to remove knee-high weeds and piles of rubble, establishing a quiet and beautiful environment from the barren soil. The first thing that makes people feel good is the well-organized layout, which is both solemn and dignified.</p>
<p>As of Christmas Eve, they had accommodated 966 refugees and orphans, most of whom were sent by the police bureau. Very few applied on their own. There were 449 healthy adults, 464 children, 6 women, and 47 elderly and infirm, all classified according to their age and gender. The composition of these nearly a thousand people is extremely complex. There are vagrants, beggars, and petty thieves who are generally recognized as social outcasts, orphans whose parents have died, illegitimate children who have been cruelly abandoned, civil servants, small businessmen, and even college students from higher education institutions. How to manage and train these thousands of displaced people is a serious problem. Director Zhou Zuwang raised this point to the reporter. He said: "Now, they are focusing on training, and have also set up three groups for management, life, education, and special education. As for daily life, the emphasis is on the spirit above all else, and it is completely militarized. In addition to the two major assemblies for raising and lowering the flag in the morning and evening, which include spiritual speeches, other activities such as physical training, labor service, individual talks, and group discussions are constantly carried out every day. Their slogan is 'Education and nurturing go hand in hand, work and study are equally important.' Their educational principle is that for children, reading is more important than work, for healthy adults, work is more important than reading, and for the elderly and infirm, nurturing is the only task."</p>
<p>In order to cultivate the spirit of self-governance among refugees and orphans, everything is managed by themselves. All forty or so staff members are only responsible for supervision. They have divided the area into many small units such as districts, households, and groups. In addition, according to the skills of the refugees, many work teams have been formed, such as masonry, carpentry, kitchen, sewing, and laundry.</p>
<p>Many refugees and orphans suffer from skin diseases, venereal diseases, and opium addiction, accounting for more than 30%. The Health Bureau has now sent two doctors and three nurses to be stationed in the home to be responsible for treatment. If they encounter serious illnesses, they are sent to Renji, Shiyi, or Municipal hospitals for treatment, so there is a guarantee in terms of health.</p>
<p>The quota for the home is 1,200 to 1,500 people. The police bureau hopes that they can accommodate up to 10,000 people. In the absence of money and materials, they can only hope that philanthropists who are enthusiastic about charity will generously donate.</p>
<p>Finally, the reporter would like to report that Mao Zipei, Director of the Welfare Department of the Bureau of Social Affairs, and Huang Tiren, Section Chief Yan Changyan, and other officials specially went to participate in the party last night, which is indeed worthy of respect. Indeed, we cannot ignore this group of displaced people who have been forgotten by the people.</p>

<h3>Tales of Christmas</h3>
<p>— Zhang Peiyue</p>
<p>The Origin of Christmas</p>
<p>It is commonly believed that December 25th is Jesus's birthday, and Christmas is the celebration of his birth. In reality, the exact date of Jesus's birth is not documented in detail in history. Originally, various European and Western nations held seasonal celebrations around the winter solstice, starting approximately on December 25th. Later, Christians replaced the original festivities with the celebration of Christmas, and that day gradually became Jesus's birthday, with everyone believing that Jesus was born on the midnight of December 24th. However, even now, the celebration of Jesus's birth retains many festive entertainments from ancient national seasons.</p>
<p>Legend has it that the first celebration of Jesus's birth was by King Aethelstan in York, England, in the year 521 AD.</p>
<p>Christmas Cards</p>
<p>"Merry Christmas" cards were invented by the British. Initially, people simply offered verbal greetings. Later, the British adopted the custom of calling out this phrase at the windows of every house on Christmas morning. Soon, people began writing holiday greetings on letters and sending them to each other. It wasn't until 1846 that ten artists in London, led by a man named Kang Yuese, used lithography to print holiday greetings, painted colorful pictures, about the size of a business card, and that was the first Christmas card.</p>
<p>Santa Claus</p>
<p>Santa Claus, dressed in red, with a white beard, and carrying a large bag of toys, can be said to be entirely created for children. Therefore, Santa Claus in various countries is derived from the deification of gods protecting children. The German god protecting children is Christkindlein, and Santa Claus is called Kriss Kringle. In the Netherlands, it is St. Nicholas, and Santa Claus is still called St. Nicholas, but after being introduced to the United States, it became Santa Claus. Although his name varies slightly from place to place, his mission is the same, which is to increase children's interest. So he always carries toys, slips down the chimney, and stuffs things into the stockings hanging in front of the bed.</p>
<p>Speaking of the origins of chimneys and stockings, it is also very interesting. Originally, the British had a custom similar to our year-end cleaning, that is, before the New Year, the chimney must be swept clean to let good luck come in. Putting these together, Santa Claus comes down from the chimney every time. Hanging stockings was thought up by the British and Americans. Originally, Dutch children put their shoes by the fireplace, and it is said that Santa Claus must see the shoes placed there before stuffing the toys inside. The British and Americans are smarter and use socks, which can be stretched and have a larger space, so they can put more things in.</p>
<p>Christmas Trees and Holly</p>
<p>The origin of Christmas trees is said to be inconsistent. Some say it originated with Luther, who, in order to show his children the scenery of snow-covered trees under the starlight, cut down a small fir tree in the garden and placed it in the room, lighting candles on it. That night was Christmas Eve, and later generations imitated this practice. But some say it originated with Saint Boniface, who once cut down a large oak tree in the forest. When a gust of wind passed, many trees fell, but only a small fir tree remained standing. Saint Boniface then declared it a sacred tree, and Christmas began to use it for decoration. The use of holly at Christmas also has early origins. In ancient times, Romans used laurel branches to represent peace, victory, and joy. Later, Christians followed suit, using laurel branches to decorate windows, meaning that Jesus had been inside. The British used holly instead of laurel branches. It is said that the white flowers of holly symbolize holiness, and the red berries symbolize the blood Jesus shed for sinners. Holly wreaths further represent the crown of thorns worn by Jesus during his martyrdom.</p>

<h3>Christmas and Santa Claus</h3>
<p>— Lequn</p>
<p>The god of war roared Santa Claus away, so that he could freely and unrestrainedly increase his military power to satisfy his homicidal desires. As a result, wars of aggression began, from East Asia to Western Europe, to the entire globe. The continuous breath of gunfire filled the world. Would Santa Claus dare to come down on Christmas Day?</p>
<p>But finally, the invaders surrendered. Therefore, this year's Christmas is expected to be more lively than in previous years, because people believe that in a "peaceful" world, Santa Claus will definitely come to earth and give people happiness. We also hope so, so that our people, who have suffered for eight years, can stretch their backs comfortably. Perhaps the government's designation of Christmas as our National Renaissance Day is intended for this purpose!</p>
<p>In the shop windows on the street, there are many different images of Santa Claus and Christmas trees, Christmas cards..., making the streets look too good. Just like the chairman's portrait after the victory news was announced, it is truly comparable before and after! Schools are on vacation, companies are closed, and there is an atmosphere of peace.</p>
<p>Visiting a foreign friend's house, coincidentally, that friend's parents and siblings were all crowded together, arranging a Santa Claus pattern the size of a room. Seeing their energy, it was truly interesting. According to that friend, they had already spent hundreds of yuan, and it was not yet fully successful. Grateful to the friend's mother, who said that I was a foreigner and did not know the allusions, she pointed out in detail: a certain place is Santa Claus's entrance, a certain place is where children receive blessings, a certain place is... What made me strange was that Santa Claus does not go through the doors and windows, but comes down from the chimney, no wonder that friend's mother said I did not understand the allusions.</p>
<p>This year's Santa Claus being able to come down is something to look forward to, everyone who is looking forward to Christmas is thinking this way. Me too, the same.</p>

So many people in Europe, men, women, old and young, are in a state of hunger. Why must we be fattened like pigs? Please take from the surplus to make up for the deficiency. I am willing to eat less."</p>
<p>The United States and Europe form a strong contrast. Words like freezing, hunger, etc., have long been forgotten in the United States. Christmas turkeys are being transported by the truckload; to avoid crowding when buying meat, the price limit has been increased by two-tenths per pound; after the shoe rationing system has been abolished, large-scale production can be carried out, and free purchase is allowed; "Nylon" rayon stockings will be available on the market for Christmas; Victory Company's unbreakable records are on the market; RCA's new-style coin-operated electrical machine.</p>
<p>It is estimated that Japan will need to import 3.4 million tons of food next year, worth 300 million yuan, in order to avoid famine. However, Japan itself does not have the capacity, and not only must rely on the Allied countries to lend this huge sum of money, but also must rely on Allied ships to transport food to Japan.</p>
<p>In China, eight years of continuous war devastation and continuous escape and wandering, "how urgent the people need relief is something that no one dares to speculate."</p>

<h3>My First Christmas</h3>
<p>— Zheng Biru, Second Grade of Zhongxi Girls' High School</p>
<p>Ah! How happy childhood Christmases were!</p>
<p>A week before Christmas, my mother and aunt took us to the company and asked us to choose our favorite gifts; I wanted a jump rope and a box of coloring paper, which I had wanted for a long time, although I didn't know how to color yet; my brothers each chose a seven-star sword with seven red stars and a toy gun.</p>
<p>A few days before Christmas, I also attended a Christmas service (it was my first time in my life). When the choir sang hymns gracefully and slowly walked in, the two people in front held golden crosses and a bright red flag. I even thought angels had come, and I clapped my little hands happily, shouting, "Ah! Mom, look! Little angels, little angels!" Mom quickly stopped me. The day before Christmas Eve, the living room was decorated with a Christmas tree, covered with gold, silver, and colored Christmas bells and small stars, and also decorated with countless light bulbs, blue, red,... of various colors. A large star stood on top of the tree, one side silver, one side gold, which was also something we had been looking forward to for a long time. On Christmas Eve, after we had dinner, we sat in the living room and waited. After a while, the electric lights went out, and we shouted in unison, "Ah!" This shout was both surprising and joyful; surprising because the electric lights went out, but at the same time the lights on the Christmas tree lit up, so the shout turned into joy. Ah! How beautiful! The five-colored lights reflected the gold and silver bells and stars, emitting a brilliant glow, almost blinding our eyes. The happiness at that time was beyond words. We jumped and laughed around the tree until we were tired and stopped.</p>
<p>This was my first Christmas as a child. Now, peace has come, and light has returned to the world. This year's Christmas is the first Christmas after peace, so I want to go back to the way it was before and celebrate it to the fullest.</p>

<h3>Rommel and the Wounded Soldiers</h3>
<p>— Jin Chun</p>
<p>In the North African campaign, the Battle of Tobruk was the most intense. The city was repeatedly entered and exited by British and German troops, changing hands several times, resulting in a tragic tug-of-war. The following story took place in Tobruk, and was told by a captain who was the director of the British wounded soldiers' hospital in the city.</p>
<p>The first time Rommel's troops broke into Tobruk, the hospital continued to work quietly as usual, treating the wounded soldiers who were brought in, whether British or German, equally.</p>
<p>The hospital suddenly fell silent, and Rommel came in person. He stood and looked at rows of hospital beds. He walked up to a German wounded soldier and asked a simple question. He listened quietly to the wounded soldier telling him. He walked along a row of beds, stopping from time to time to ask other German wounded soldiers.</p>
<p>Finally, Rommel greeted the British captain. He said, "Our soldiers tell me that they are treated and cared for by you exactly like the British soldiers. You are short of medicines, but you share them with them. I will send someone to send you medicines. You continue to work like this, and no one will harass you." After he finished speaking, he strode out.</p>
<p>The medicines were delivered quickly, and the hospital used these medicines to save many British and German soldiers. The hospital continued to work without any interference or harassment.</p>
<p>After a few days, the battle situation suddenly changed, and Rommel's troops abandoned the city and retreated, but when retreating, the hospital was not damaged in any way. The battle situation shifted, and victory and defeat alternated, but the hospital only continued to work as usual.</p>

<h3>Lincoln Shines Shoes</h3>
<p>— Sun Xilin</p>
<p>One morning, the location was the White House.</p>
<p>The secretary visited the President for "official business." Led by the messenger to a large living room, walking to the should be, next to a man kept ge zhi ge zhi shining shoes, the secretary did not pay attention to it, and was about to walk past, but was shocked and stopped.</p>
<p>It turned out that the President was shining his own shoes.</p>
<p>"You are the President, doing such things, being seen by others, is quite unsightly, especially by noble women..." The secretary often heard people say behind his back that the President often revealed the crude attitude of a countryman, kept it in mind, and couldn't help but say so today.</p>
<p>Lincoln smiled and looked at the secretary with surprised eyes:</p>
<p>"Ah, is shining shoes a shameful thing? The President and the shoe shiner are both public servants working for the world. There should be no low-ranking occupations in the world, only people with base hearts."</p>
<p>Hopefully, today's dignitaries can all listen to President Lincoln's famous saying: "The President and the shoe shiner are both public servants working for the world!"</p>

<h3>The Christmas Eve Bells</h3>
<p>— Zhang Degan</p>
<p>The sparse woods and low hedges trembled in the sharp north wind, and the oak trees had already borne fruit. On this moonlit night, the Christmas bells burst into sparks, flying from the spire over the rooftops, illuminating the souls of mankind.</p>
<p>The church bells rang in high and low tones, proclaiming peace and mercy, proclaiming all the virtues of mankind. The echoes of the bells fell on the villages and inns, fell on the mansions with deep fireplaces, warming the souls of mankind.</p>
<p>On this sacred night, no one who heard the church bells did not feel a star in their heart, illuminating their dark future, and giving them more courage to move forward on the journey of life. Because the Christmas Eve bells proclaim peace and mercy, which Christ exchanged with sacrifice.</p>

<h3>Mrs. Truman</h3>
<p>— Shen Yikun</p>
<p>President Truman's mother, Mrs. Martha Truman, was ninety-three years old last month, but she is still very vigorous; she constantly reads the U.S. Congressional Record in order to know what those congressmen are saying. She said, "I want to live to be a hundred years old."</p>
<p>"Harry (President Truman's name) sends me the Congressional Record," she said with a triumphant expression.</p>
<p>She has always read her own books, and "without glasses." Until last year, because of a fall, her eyes were affected. Only then did Truman's sister, Miss Mary, read to her.</p>
<p>Mrs. Truman and Miss Truman live in Grandview, Jackson County, Missouri, not far from Kansas City. The whole town has eight hundred people. They live in a modern yellow bungalow with five rooms, separated from the main street by a lane. Half a mile outside the town is the old Truman farm, where Mrs. Truman spent most of her life.</p>
<p>Mrs. Truman was born on November 25, 1852, on a farm, which is today's southeast residential area of Kansas City.</p>
<p>In 1881, she married John Truman, and two years later, moved to Lamar, one hundred miles from Grandview. On May 8, 1884, President Truman was born there.</p>
<p>Mrs. Truman pays close attention to Congress, but this is just one example of her concern for world affairs. She carefully reads evening newspapers every day and clips them out. She likes to listen to the radio, especially news programs and operas.</p>
<p>Mrs. Truman said, "I don't think humans should have invented the atomic bomb. I am against killing. Harry is also a supporter of peace."</p>
<p>She has three grandsons who participated in World War II: Sergeant Harry Truman (the same name as the President) recently retired from Camp Robinson, and participated in the battles of France, Germany, and Austria; and two sons of the President's brother, Vivian.</p>

<h3>Relief Supplies Sold at Parity Prices Should Be Improved to Benefit Civilians</h3>
<p>— Jun Yi</p>
<p>Since last month, a large number of American aid and relief supplies have been successively shipped to Shanghai, including wheat, flour, medicines, used clothing, canned goods, fruits, building materials, sacks, trucks, and more than a dozen other types. So far, in addition to a large amount of flour distributed by the Shanghai Branch of the Relief Administration to various charitable organizations and Jewish residents, flour and canned food have also been sent to the market for general sale at parity prices. According to Chinese Relief Administration Director Jiang Tingfu's previous remarks in Ping, this relief material is not entirely free to relieve the people, but is sold at parity prices, using work as a form of relief, and the price is 5% lower than the market price, etc. Therefore, the price of flour in this city is also 1,900 yuan per bag. We have no objection to the use of parity prices for relief supplies. However, the purpose of shipping this material to China is to relieve the general war-torn population who are unable to make a living due to rising prices, especially flour, which has always been a daily food for civilians. Middle-class families and above rarely eat it, so it feels that the set price is the same as other materials, only 5% lower than the market price, which is too harsh, and the meaning of the words "relief" does not seem to match, not only does the civilian population benefit very little, but most of them are still unable to afford it. Furthermore, many large pancake and food stalls that mainly use flour have not seen a price drop due to the abundance of flour in the market, which is ironclad evidence. As for canned fruit and dried apricots sold at parity prices recently, the price of each can is as high as 2,500 yuan, which is difficult for even the middle class to enjoy. As a result, it is inevitable that they will be bought by the wealthy, and the advertisement also prominently says "Charity Relief Sale at Parity Prices," which feels too far from the title.</p>

<h3>Vehicles Keep to the Right, Right Hand Wrapped in Red Cloth</h3>
<p>— Gu Si</p>
<p>Regarding the fact that vehicles will uniformly drive on the right starting from New Year's Day next year, I am afraid that it will be difficult for Chinese and foreign drivers to suddenly reform, thus causing trouble and making everyone feel uneasy. Regarding this matter, I have recently thought of a method that is not without benefit. That method is that every driver's right hand sleeve should be wrapped in a red cloth, so that the driver will pay attention at all times. Then, when the vehicle wants to turn, the driver will see the red cloth and be shocked, and naturally turn right. It can also be reminded at all times when driving parallel to drive to the right. This method is very effective for bicycles, tricycles, and rickshaws. If this is the case, then it will become a habit after two months.</p>
<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>Mr. Editor:</p>
<p>Having read the "No Worries About Lung Disease Theory" in your esteemed publication for several consecutive days, I cannot help but feel a private, joyous excitement. The fact is, I am currently twenty-one years old and recently weighed myself at one hundred and twenty-eight and a half pounds. Furthermore, my chest is quite broad and expansive. From an outward appearance, my physique is quite robust and healthy. However, since last autumn, after an X-ray revealed a tubercle in my left lung, I have taken good care of my health. For the past year, although the condition has not worsened, it has not improved either. I usually cough up a lot of phlegm, and occasionally there are traces of blood. This constant dragging on is a matter of deep concern. Now that I have seen what is published in your column, a few questions arise. Is the "compression of the lesion" method effective for all stages of lung disease? And approximately what are the costs involved? The fact is, I live in Jiangbei and reside at school alone. All expenses must be budgeted in advance. I would be especially grateful if you could recommend a reliable doctor. Your esteemed column always takes serving the public as its mission, and I trust that you will not disappoint me.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Fan Mingjin</p>
<p>(Editor's Reply) Compression therapy (i.e., pneumothorax) is best when treated early. Please seek treatment at the Red Cross Hospital. The cost is approximately ten thousand yuan or more per year.</p>
