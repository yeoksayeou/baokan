<h3>峇厘巴板兩處地區　日軍展開邀擊戰　三水長編隊急襲敵陣地</h3>
<p>西南太平洋基地十三日中央社電進攻峇厘巴板之敵軍，仍頑强來攻日軍陣地，敵艦仍徐緩發砲轟擊日陣，刻兩軍之決戰場，係在　流峇厘巴板中央部之河川兩岸及製油所與飛機場附近兩處，日軍對抗敵之物量攻勢，展開强靱不屈之邀擊戰。敵於九日來攻飛機塲附近之日陣地，但誤觸日軍地雷陣，死傷百名，日軍乘機突擊，頗獲成功。敵方最近避免由道路進攻，改由密林地帶逐漸進取，日軍加以勇敢截擊，十日會炸燬敵戰軍一輛，擱挫二輛，炸燬迫擊砲二門，殲敵五十名。</p>
<p>南方前綫基地十三日中央社電峇厘巴板之日守備部隊，對敵陣各處實行肉搏攻擊，致使敵軍陷於混亂狀態，其中以國分，山本，小林三水兵長所編成之一隊，於六日傍晚由基地出發，得印度納西亞人之協力，潛入敵砲兵陣地後方，迨至日落時，乃急襲敵陣，以炸彈擊毀敵砲二門，並使敵兵傷亡甚多，且小林水兵長於歸途中復單身襲擊敵陣，以手溜彈破　敵砲門，自巴亦壯烈陣亡。</p>
<h3>B29型機多架　襲敦賀等地　並在若狹灣投下機雷</h3>
<p>大阪十三日中央社電　敵B29型機約百架，於十二日下午九時四十五分左右分成三梯團來襲敦賀地區，一部於敦賀市投下燒夷彈，其主力部隊則於若狹　投下機雷，另有B29型約五十架，於下午十二時　右侵入大垣，一投下燒夷彈，致上述三市發生火災，但迄十三日上午二時半已經撲滅，日方損害輕微。</p>
<p>柬京十三日中央社電　敵B29型約一百四十架，十二日晚十一時起，以一架及少數機　隊，分散來襲關東地方，其中一小都市，約歷三小時，因此，字都宮市附近及京演地區之一部發生火災，迄十三日彿曉概已撲滅。</p>
<h3>日本強化航空勢力</h3>
<p>東京十三日中央社電此問「讀　新聞」報海軍記者稱，從來敵機動部隊於行動後，必實施登陸作戰，例如硫黃島，雷伊泰昂，呂宋島，冲繩鳥等皆然，但十日出動艦　機，來襲關東地區後，並未見有同樣之新行動，然敵方渴欲取得更接近日本土之航空基地，故此後更將派遺機動部隊來襲，我人必須加以警戒。敵機B29型企圖消失日本之戰意與戰力，但敵內心怖畏者，爲日航空勢力之整頓强化，敵B51型之盤迴於關東天空，爲時僅數十分鐘，不能充分攻擊日航空基地，故欲藉艦　機之長時間反複攻擊，以蓬到其目的，但日航空勢力爲備本土決戰計，運用最巧妙之手段，嚴然存在，並且正逐日强化中。</p>
<h3>日學生製飛機　已出動前綫</h3>
<p>千葉十三日中央社電千葉巿之一隅，業稱出現完全由學生成立之飛機工廠，凡製造零件以至裝置成機，統由學生之手完成，其所造飛機業已出動前終者，已達××架之譜，該學校工廠之工作人員，係全年動員於××工場之學生，全體共計×××名，均爲該校學生及卒業生。</p>
<h3>日軍在緬南部確保戰略據點　一部渡過喜丹河猛擊</h3>
<p>緬甸前綫基地十三日中央社電　據守庇古山險之日軍强力部隊，現扼守南緬險要山脈，阻止敵軍侵入，確保戰略據點，更對敵軍唯一輪送路綫之仰光·曼達萊公路及仰光·克羅姆公路，實施突擊，以擾亂敵陣，因此，敵軍爲避免危險起見，不敢於夜間活動，僅於盡問以百數十輛栽重汽車集團運輸，同時爲期輸送安全計，常時更使飛機，坦克車，裝甲汽車嚴加警戒，並於主要據點配置坦克率及裝甲汽車，以圖輸送萬全。又日第一綫部隊於敵中活躍，已完全牽制敵軍侵攻作戰，因是，戰綫遂暫成膠着狀態。又據守喜丹河畔變曲部堅固陣地之日軍，亦阻止敵軍，以呼應庇古山脈地帶日軍，且克服月初審降之驟雨，渡過喜丹河，展開攻勢，擊滅頑强抵抗之敵軍，且奪取敵軍重要據點之　卡修庇古果方五十公里及其西北五公里之地點，刻對殘敵展開猛擊中。日軍此次次擊作戰，乃表示防衛緬甸之決意，同時亦係威脅之新作戰。依據撣部高原峻險之日軍精　部隊，又陰止敵軍之前進，敵方報道此方戰鬥情形謂：「戰綫自一月前即呈膠着狀熊，今戰勢有利日軍」·對其苦戰及敵機動部隊難以使用，則極力避免　　。</p>
<h3>傳蘇渝簽訂　友好條約</h3>
<p>蘇黎　十三日中央社電　據華盛頓美聯社電：據　當地蘇聯大使館　有緊密連絡之人十傳出消息，此次宋子文訪問莫斯科結果，締結蘇聯重慶間友好條約，業於莫斯科簽字。又聞該項條約幷未涉及領土問題。</p>
<h3>顧維鈞返抵英</h3>
<p>瑞典京城十三日中央社電據此間獲悉：重慶駐英大使顧維鈞。已於週三自　扺達倫敦。</p>
<h3>蕪發售平米</h3>
<p>蕪湖十三日中央社電本縣所辦平　，已於十二日正式發售，因準備米糧未能依期集中，故照原定數量滅半發售，即大口每日准買三合，小口二合。</p>
<h3>蘇省各縣　農貸分會成立　日記者赴蘇錫考察</h3>
<p>蘇州十三日中央社電蘇省府農貸會自開始辦公以來，計劃推進各項農貸工作，並由省府分令各縣縣府組織分會，頒發最貸分會組織章程，現各　分會業經組織成立，則將滬市　詢委員會之資金，分別貸與需款股急之農戶，　以增加生產，强化晨村經濟。</p>
<p>蘇州十三日中央社電上海大陸新報記者廣瀨及同盟社記者小林，爲調查蘇州地區農產物資增產收買狀况，特於八日來蘇，分訪食糧收買會理事·淸鄉地區合作社理事，聽取關於米糧收買狀况，各合作社運營之現况等，九日下午赴省府訪問任省長後，於十日轉赴無錫攷察。</p>
<h3>蘇四區專署　再視察鄕</h3>
<p>鎭江十三日中央社電蘇省四區行政專署爲考察鎭丹揚三縣各鄉區施政情况起見，將於本月下旬起，實施第二期視察，以期溝通民意，使官民間打成一片。</p>
<h3>日東鄕外相　晉宮覲見</h3>
<p>東京十三日中央社電日東鄉外相兼大東亞相，於十三日上午十時十分進宮，謁見天皇陛下，啓　政務後退出。</p>
<h3>英美企求對蘇　保持勢力均衡　三巨頭會議前途黯澹</h3>
<p>東京十三日中央社電英美蘇之三頭會談，傳構將於十五日前後假柏林近郊波炎坦宮殿舉行。此次會談之目的，乃在裁定因瓜分德國而起之列國紛爭，此次會談結果，其對於歐洲之和平與東亞戰爭之影響，關係殊爲密切。而此次會談實與往昔會談不同，蓋因會談主角已易人，美方前爲羅期福，今則易以特魯曼，且邱吉爾究竟能否繼任英首相，　屬一大疑問、據構，邱氏擬與工黨首領阿特里聯袂出席，互分責任，然而雖察蘇聯外交之前例，如對方稍一失措前讓步，則蘇聯行將一衝而人，則所有之折衝皆不易圓滿推展。又特魯曼手腕之不及羅斯福，乃世人所公認，其最近之行動，究已能否獲得蘇聯之信認，尤爲疑問。按羅斯福則曾發揮國內議會之能力，而特魯曼則顯乏其能。同時英國方面，保守　執行委員會爲　求阿特里互分責任，傳稱業起紛爭，今美英派出如此無能且無宣任之代表，如何能予蘇聯以信任。回溯第一次德黑爾會談，當時之中心問題乃第二戰綫問題，戰後問題尙爲其次。第二次維爾　會談，則以國際機構爲主，此外附有作戰問題。此次之　資坦會談，美英方面則宣傳謂，事實上爲歐洲之和平會議，因蘇聯於會談中尙有問題之黑海與土耳其地中海方面，將照例採取光發制人之外交進攻手段。憶及世界第一次呂戰後，列强之　鎖蘇聯，均係由該方面開始策動，故蘇聯此種手段，亦自然之趨勢。而義大利方面要求媾和締約，亦由來已久，且希臘保加利亞等巴爾幹方面各小國之國境紛爭，亦已成爲待決之燃眉問題。據傳美英或將以此次之會談，作爲事實上解決地中海縣案之會談，然而會談之中心問題，旨在處置德國問題及波羅的海沿岸三國問題，其他國境未決問題自然亦包括其中。總括言之，美英兩國於此次會議及未來之和平會議，其目的當在如何阻止蘇聯勢力之西漸，並保持三國於歐洲勢力這均衡也。然關於美英蘇三國勢力之均衡問題，並不限於歐洲地域，論及此點，東亞問題尤其絕戲不能置於例外，蓋蘇聯對於東亞問題表示深切之關注。涉及渝政府及延安問題，蘇聯國內輿論則大肆論評不休，可見蘇聯對其他問題及其他地域之態度、依然暫守秘策。</p>
<h3>基夫萊　任澳首相</h3>
<p>里斯本十三日中央社電　據康白拉訊：澳洲財長基夫萊，現已正式受命爲首相，以繼寇丁之後</p>
<h3>義前首相　尼琪返國</h3>
<p>里斯本十三日中央社電　據瑞士電台廣播：羅馬之途次業抵米蘭，尼琪於一九一九年至一九二九年任首相兼內相，於墨索里尼雞立法西斯政權時，乃亡命於國外，尼氏爲始終反對法西斯主義者也</p>
<h3>墨西哥外長　巴迭拉辭職</h3>
<p>里斯本十三日中央社電據墨西哥京城消息：墨外長巴迭拉，已向總統呈請辭職獲准。</p>
<h3>西姆拉會議　陷停頓狀態</h3>
<p>東京十三日中央社電討論英對印度提案之西姆拉會議，刻已呈現停頓狀態。此次提案實蹈一一九四二年三月「克里浦斯案」之覆轍，故母寗謂此次會議乃具體表示克里浦斯案之一部，故欲使西姆拉會議之成果決定重要事項，實極爲危險。然西姆，而於一九四二年四月嚴詞拒絕「克里浦斯提案」之國民會議派，亦竟出席比次華維爾總督召集之西姆拉圓桌會議，此點實有重大意義。然久與英政府頑强繼續抵抗之國民會議派，何以一旦變更其歷來態度，吾人就此必須考慮過去三年間變化之悄勢。蓋於一九四二年春季日軍行將壓制印度國境時之　張情勢，與對德戰事業已終了並對印度國境直接威脅之壓迫已完全除去之今日情勢，顯然大有不同。</p>
<h3>籠絡印度舊案翻新</h3>
<p>老奸巨滑之英國·已充分瞭解此種國際情勢，故乃舊版翻新，再提示舊案，强使印度各派同意，而會議派亦自充分瞭解英國此種意向，三十日甘地翁於西姆地會議席上，亦曾謂「會議派知西姆拉會議爲印度獨立之先擊，故乃參加」，蓋因彼等深知當此情形下，唯有出席西姆拉會議，可謂對印度有貢獻，故始參加此次會議。又吾人預想與國民會議派議長阿柴特共同出席會議之甘地翁，亦竟充任總督及會議派之顧問，而立於西姆拉正式會議席外推進會議，積極進行，由此亦可知會議派及甘地翁對西姆拉會議所採取之態度如何。故吾人不　國民會議派領袖尼赫魯之聲明，即可明確瞭解該派對新提案所取之態度，蓋不能以武力由，除脚踏實地一步一步前進外，實別無良策。國民會議派內之支配階級，其見解大致如是，又與會議派對立之回敎徒聯監之態度如何，亦頗　注目。</p>
<h3>柏林英美軍　接收軍政府　英贈蘇最高將領勳章</h3>
<p>瑞典京城十三日中央社電　據柏林消息：自英美蘇法四聯合國軍事當局，於日前召開會議後，在柏林四國軍事政府間之僵局，已於週三始得弛解，自昨日淸晨九時起，英美兩國已將彼等佔領區內之軍政府實施接收。</p>
<p>瑞典京城十三日中央社電據相林訊：蒙高茂萊將軍業於日前以英國十字勳章，授與蘇聯巨哥夫將軍，又以武士十字勳草授與洛哥沙夫斯基將軍，同時蘇聯般高參謀總長蘇柯洛夫斯基及麥烈　均被授與武士十字勳章。授與勳章之儀式，在勃倫登保門舉行。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>整飭金融巿場</h3>
<p>者關於批評金融界現象的來函，這幾天猶如雪片飛來，要求我們站在人民的立塲，主持公道，向當局建議，向金融界忠吿，爲一般市民找一條維特最低生活的出路。這些來函，大部分是最近　　撥款單本票等佰用通貨及現鈔貼水之損害的一股市民，但是其間也有不少金融界及實業界中的人，他們指摘目前金融界的黑暗及危機，希望我們把來函公開披露，以明是非黑白而免一部份金融業者徒業不白之寃。本報　於爲民　舌的使命，凡有利於人羣社會者，所謂大義在的，不容反顧，對於一般讀者來函的要求，在原則上自當考慮接受。不過我們處理問題，竭力避免滲人一點意氣，而且還得認淸客觀環境，否則，事實上的反饗，反不致有利於人羣社會。所以，對於這些來函，我們暫時不預備發表，並不是缺乏正義感與勇氣，這是希望大家了解的。</p>
<p>目前的信用通用問題，從報紙上看，從當局的表示來看，我們不能說中央及本市有關當局「袖手旁觀」，而當局是確實盡過一番努力，並且正在盡力以謀解救之道，但看各項對策的頒布，以及這幾天對於金融市塲非法行爲的檢舉，大批行玆的受懲處及公開宣布，都可以看到當局負責的積極精神，因此，一味指摘當局態度的，我們不能隨聲附和的。</p>
<p>今日問題的　結，不在當局之「不顧民生疾苦」，而在當局怎樣解決這種脅迫民生的重大問題。這一點，也就是今日輿論界一致遺憾的地方。譬如說廢止撥款單而代之以各行莊的本票，這種辦法，不僅是揚場止沸的治標辦法，而且簡直對處弱華斃的病人用大瀉劑，使嚴重的信用通貨問題更加嚴東了。因爲撥款單無論如何尙是國家銀行負責的信用通貨，而本票則任何銀行錢莊都可以開發的票據。縱使當局有種種防制的辦法，但是，下面幾點却是不容否認的危險現象：</p>
<p>第一，隨認各行莊可以開發本票以代現鈔，，賦與本票以流通價値，這就是承認各行玆都有變相的通貨發行權。本來國家銀行的通貨發行額，已有膨賬的跡象，而不得不採取發行各種庫券及金證券以圖收回通貨，今竟公然允許數百家金融機關一齊有發行變相通貨之權，對於金融及人心之刺激爲如何？這是不待詳述的。</p>
<p>第二，目前曾受人　　的通貨中儲券，最高票額尙祗五千元（一萬元券今日才發行），依新頒中儲行條例之修改條文，最高發券之額面也不過爲一萬元券。但是各行莊開發的本票，則可以任意行之，五千一萬已成最低券面、而一百萬二百萬乃至千萬亦不足爲奇，結果一方面普遍地貶低了本票的信用，（使各犬銀行的本票亦受其影響），造成市面上的兩重物價，另一方面這種大額信用通貨的流通，結果又必須轉嫁其惡評於中儲券，即比例地貶低中儲券的信用價値。</p>
<p>第三，本票的流通，由於實際上不可能利中儲券等價，而且其數額又不若中儲券之零細便於行使，結果其價格日趨低下。在坐擁鉅炎者，用以　嫁行莊及從事投機，可以說多一危害社會金融的籌碼，原無任何不便不利，最受影響者厥爲一般新水階級及正當工商業者，不得不忍痛以二成左右的貼水換取現鈔。在薪水階級，固然只有忍受這種慘重的剝削，在工商業者，其所受損失，不能不轉嫁於主顧，於是物價更日趨高峯漫無限制。</p>
<p>這次本市三十五行莊的遭受個別處分，當然是金融檢查獲揮功效的表現，不過，在本市全體行莊中，是否僅此幾家應受處分，是否公平，我們從各方面的觀察，還是不無疑問的。老實說，若干行莊有中儲少數人員爲背景的，必須特別嚴格的加以檢查，檢查而發現有危害金融實據，更應從嚴予以懲治，以　刁頑，才能收公正持平之　。至於現鈔貼永之害，對於平民階層最深入最普遍，簡消是殺人不見血的武器。谷行莊對於客戶限制撥付現鈔，籍口中儲供給不够，但一部分行莊難免在藉口下倫天換日，這也是中儲給予的機會。何况對於中儲少數行員大做現鈔貼水，外間人言嘖嘖，例如某級某等行員每天可有若干現鈔可支，而其所支之數，超過其薪津倍數懸殊，試問彼輩以此現鈔作何去路。又如中儲某等級行員以票據解入後，即可支取現鈔，如此循環貼現，即可坐獲鉅利。所以，嚴格的說，如果現鈔供給確有　殊的不够，那末，爲什麽一經貼水，即可滾　而來，由此可見，現鈔恐慌完全是人爲的，尤其是一般特殊階級所　斷造成的。傳聞中儲常局已經查出若干不法行員，予以處分，我們認爲旣然有此決心與事實，慶將不法份子的姓名與非狀，公開露布，使社會大衆咸加唾棄，藉以爲來者烔戒。</p>
<p>據一般人民的理想，認爲信用通貨的問題，根本不應該發生。因爲只要政府有決心，旣收回了發款單，現在可進一步禁止各行莊發行本票（除非各戶自行請末），而完全由中儲行對各行莊合理分配現鈔，一切金融上的責任由巾央直接負担，而對於行玆業務統制也就容易得多了。</p>
<p>但是，我們必須說明者，第一，目前信用通貨的危機已很深刻，有關常局必須以遠大的目光，　和平區全體人民的利益着想，迅謀價正有效的對　，第二，一種眞正有效辦法之實施，自然不免影響到一部分藉不良制度以謀利者，但是「一家哭，何似一路哭」，當局應有大仁大勇；何况這少數人的錢也早已謙飽了，決不會哭！第三，對於各行莊應有更嚴格的檢查，統一管理。本票開出至期必須兌現，不能再開本票。同時，對於各行玆的現鈔分配，爲表示大公無私，應由中儲發行機關會同銀錢兩業會商公決。</p>
<p>金融事業的使命，是促進國家社會的繁榮，帮助整個經濟的活潑，民生因此安定，所以，金融事業應有積極的貢獻，雖在戰時條件的限制下，但是至少也不應有危害民生經濟的相反現象。</p>
<h3>歐戰漫話（一）</h3>
<p>歐戰是結束了。回顧德蘇美三國在歐洲方面的作戰情形，我產可以看到許多極奇怪有趣的現象，茲綜合各方消息，叙述如下：</p>
<h3>德國之作戰目標</h3>
<p>先說蘇聯。蘇聯的歡洲部分，有一半以上遭受德軍破壞，而德軍退却時，又不問都巿鄕村，凡是蘇聯境內的，即將其燒得一物不剩，因而蘇聯三次五年計畫的辛苦威就，完全化爲灰燼。可是。在戰鬥上，紅軍取的是正面攻擊法，對於妨礙其前進或實行抵抗的據點，則集中砲火，加以擊漬，但對不作抵抗之處，紅軍並不胡亂攻擊。就是紅軍機羣的空襲，也始終是戰術轟炸，在整個德蘇戰爭問，紅軍的戰略轟炸，不過數次，而且限於油田地帶或純粹的軍事設備。蘇聯空軍的轟炸柏林，也是偵察飛行一類的小規模空襲，所以柏林的市民認爲東方來的轟炸是沒有危險性的。然而，蘇聯空軍的兵力並不少，集結在戰錢的，數約二萬，足與英美匹敵。</p>
<p>反之，美軍的破壞德國，却絲毫沒有慈悲心。轟炸時，不問是軍事設備也好，住宅區或歷史紀念物也好，凡可破壞者，都是他們的轟炸目標。他們的理由是在藉此沮喪德國民衆的戰意，可是他們知値這樣的做法很少效果，因此，他們的眞意，顯然是想完全破壞歐洲文化。</p>
<p>柏林幾經轟炸後，明興街上却有兩所住宅奇蹟似地未遭破壞，傲然　立在滿目灰燼之中。可是，隔不多久，美機却發現了它們，於是特地飛來轟炸，集中地投下大型炸彈，結果，這兩所住宅也不能例外化爲瓦磔堆了。又如特勒斯登，本無軍事設備，也無兵工廠，從古以來就是一個學術與醫學的和平城市，所以大家猜想美機總不會光顧投彈的。豈知他們將德國都市破壞浮盡以後，終於飛來空襲這個和平的城市了。一擊之下，這個城是燬了，並且死傷二十萬市民。今日，德國境內，恐怕已經沒有一個人口五萬以上的都市能够保全。甚至一萬人以上的小城、也難逃此浩刧。例如克倫資烏，本是奧特河畔一個人口不過一萬二千的小鎭，可是在它化爲德蘇最後的激戰場所，而被蘇軍佔領以前，也這美國空軍捷足先到，一　把它毀滅了。</p>
<p>然而，情形雖然如此，德國却稱其戰爭目的是：第一在於除去來自東方的布爾雪維兄威脅。所以高聲疾呼，企圖組成反蘇十字軍，並提倡長後與所謂民主主義國家聯合，成立共同戰綫。當德國尙未屈服時，甚至一度希望和英美妥協，而繼續對蘇戰爭。然而，實際的作戰上，可說是由於地理的條件吧，V1號，V2號及其他新兵器，却完全對付英美，這眞是一固不可思議的現象。</p>
<h3>加丘耶火箭砲</h3>
<p>如果從兵器的質量的角度來看，德國失敗的原因，特別可以指出來的，就是蘇聯的戰車和英美的空軍。以德國爲科學最優秀國家自負的希特勒，對於蘇聯的戰車，也曾稱　其質與景雙方都相當可觀。而尤其在蘇聯所用的火砲中，認爲新出的加丘耶砲特別可怕。</p>
<p>加丘耶砲，是十餘門小型火箭砲聯裝而成的，只要一扳機關，數十發的火箭砲彈，便一齊中同一目標，無論怎樣堅固的陣地，都可一舉加以破壞，的確是可怕的新兵器。加丘耶這個名稱，並不是托爾斯泰名著「復活」中的女主人公，而是德軍佔領歐俄時，一個挺身站在遊擊部隊前面奮鬥的蘇聯女性的名字，她像法國的聖女貞德（Jeanne　darc）一樣，在捍衛祖國的血戰中，建立了許多功績。因此，蘇聯當局爲了永遠記念其功績起見，遂把她的芳名命名這種新式的大砲。而且特地製了一首「加丘耶之歌」，在全國各地歌唱。（未完）</p>

<h3>助學金的勸募法　希望於一般學生者</h3>
<p>本報讀者助學金受助生，雖有三千七百餘人，可是與在學的大中小學學生總數來比較，常然佔極少數。各級學校非受助生數要比受助生多幾十倍。然而他們受敎育機會應該是均等的，但是因爲家庭經濟與生活環境相差懸殊。淸寒學生，雖有天才，勤於攻續，終難克服當前的困厄！因此，我們十分誠懇地要求一般學生對於淸寒學生，抱絕對的同悄，發救濟的善心，而以事實表現給大家看。</p>
<p>所謂事實表現是指經濟的援助而言，如目前本報推行的助學金「特別勸募」，便是極好的機會。請大家來館索取印件，自動的或向親友多所勸募，早日完成三萬萬元的目標，庶幾數千淸寒優秀的受助同學，不致中途失學，而國家社會，免遭受莫大的損失。「天助自助」，願諸君三復斯言！</p>

<h3>袁衛生局長談　今後施政方針　加緊防疫並强化空襲救護</h3>
<p>市宣傳處昨（十三）日上午十時半，在市府舉行記者例會，由市衛生局新任局長袁矩範出席答覆各報社記者所詢衛生行政，公共衛生，治療機關，空襲救護等問題綦詳，茲分誌如次：</p>
<h3>衛生工作四大綱要</h3>
<p>（問）衛生局今後中心工作，貴局長已決定爲：一·處理垃圾二·加緊防疫，三·切實取締淸凉飲食物品，四·空襲救護等四大綱要，其實施計劃，可否見吿二二？尤以時屆夏令各處，堆積之垃圾，約於何時可以淸除？（答）關於上列四大綱要，即爲本人接事後之中心工作，除其中之垃圾及取締不良食品容歸納於第四第六第五第八問題中答覆外，　先就加緊防疫空襲救護兩點來談。防疫工作，就經騐所得，每於夏令，均須加緊工作，以防霍亂於可能情形下發生及傳染蔓延，故促進市民參加防疫注射，爲其重要工作。如以情勢需要關係，自應斷然施行强迫注射，一面並對從事防疫工作人員，飭其自肅，而能加倍努力於各自之本位工作，本局且擬儘量利用市立隔離醫院，及私立時疫醫院之床位，以備萬一疫病發生時，儘量收容病人。惟據知市立私立時疫醫院，現僅有床位五百左右，必要時當不敷所需，本局爲防止時疫可能發生，對於收容病人，積極將擬定方案，從事推進，藉以防患未然。至於空襲救護問題，目前亦爲重要工作之一，萬一發生空襲，則其死傷率定必重大，市民防空本部固已有救護方案，然本局爲減輕市民痛苦，減輕死傷率起見，亦即作未雨綢繆之準備，一面飭主管科擬定空襲救護收容方案，一面並積極加强及充實空襲治療工作，以期必要時，能予儘量利用巿立私立各醫院。</p>
<h3>醫院拒診殊爲不法</h3>
<p>（問）衛生局附屬機關有若干處工作情形如何？（答）衛生局現可分兩點：一，衛生行政，其附屬機關，計爲東南西北中五區衛生辦事處。二，治療機關，計有長安路，滬北，滬西·滬南各隔離醫院，紹興路醫院，浦東醫院，小沙渡路及梵王渡醫院，公濟醫院內設　病性診療所，虹鎭診療所等多處，其餘如若干醫院診療所其在各郊區者，已劃歸各縣區直接指揮，本局則負監督之責。</p>
<p>（問）本巿各大醫院拒診貧病，即有急病，醫院亦須先繳巨額診金，方可就診，此種草菅人命之醫院，形同虛設，衛生局擬如何處置？（答）本局對此甚爲重視，並對各該醫院亦深感遺憾，試問不先繳費即不收病人，確屬草菅人命，幷有產婦臨產時赴醫院，須付現鈔及全費等情，本人擬於最近召集各醫院院長談話一次，俾將各該問題付之解決，並擬求其澈底解決。</p>
<h3>堆積垃圾限期出請</h3>
<p>（問）南市閘北各地之垃圾，迄未淸除盡凈，尤以各空嚝處所糞溺續見增加，不獨臭穢四溢，抑且蠅蚋叢生，其威脅夏令衛生者至鉅，不知貴局長有無具體　取締辦法？（答）關於第一，第四，第六，第八之垃圾問題，現合併答覆如下：目前垃圾堆積之嚴重情形，於公共衛生上可謂爲最普通最基本之問題。何謂普通基本？蓋最普通者，即垃圾到碼頭後，隨時裝船運出，即吿解決。所謂最基本者，馬路如有垃圾堆積，市民即發生一種印象及其特殊之感覺，此即公共衛生上之基本問題。現若干處垃圾堆積及各垃圾碼頭大量堆積，由於船隻未能隨到隨運，及調度船隻之失常，以致碼頭積滿，照指定方向地區車到堆積，此純爲垃圾之無出路，決非淸道夫之工作不力。今後出路即調整船租之改進，無論新舊垃圾除麥根路，日輝港有特殊情形以外，其餘均可於所承包商決定後一個月以內完全出淸。南北巿垃圾及糞溺問題，據調査尙不止南北巿方面，即中心區亦有同樣情形，凡能力所可辦到者，自當儘量辦理，尤其隨處便溺，頗足影響公共衛生，深盼市民各應自重，嚴予檢肅，一面即擬與市警察局方面聯絡，以謀全面取締。</p>
<h3>嚴厲取締不潔食品</h3>
<p>（問）馬路飲食攤販，觸目皆是，其大部均無衛生設備，貴局應否擬具取締辦法，使合於夏令衛生？（答）本局對於此種不良食品之取締中心工作，業經全面展開，如邇來經檢查有碍衛生之天然冰，冰琪琳，顏色水，凉粉，酸梅湯，去皮瓜菓，甘庶等總共五千四百二十七斤，均已銷燬及毀滅，因各該飲食物品均不適合局方之規定，且多已腐敗，如飲之食之，輕則發生腹瀉生病，重則傳染疾痛發生，大部份市民均有被傳染之處，本局爲顧全市民健康着想，決不姑念少數攤販，而致影響多數市民健康，今後決對攤販予以嚴峻取締。</p>
<h3>衛生機構逐步改善</h3>
<p>垃圾問題，已詳前答，　（問）貴局長復長衛生局觀感如何？今後施政方針可見吿一二否？（答）本局中心工作已詳前答，惟本人現感衛生行政機構，尙欠簡素化及未能統一，今後擬逐步予以改善。　（問）沿馬路所掘之防空洞，以雨水積儲，蚊蠅滋生，擬請貴局曉喻市民，責令附近居戶隨時淸除，以保市民健康。（答）對於管理防空洞，巿民防空本部已訂有詳細辦法，今後本局擬聯絡保里處及防空本部，由保甲責成居戶，隨時將雨水淸除，以免蚊蠅叢生。</p>

        <h1>1945 - n195</h1>
<h3>Japanese Forces Initiate Interception Battle in Two Areas of Balikpapan; Sansui Long Formation Swiftly Assaults Enemy Positions</h3>
<p>Southwest Pacific Base, 13th (Central News Agency) - The enemy forces advancing on Balikpapan are still stubbornly attacking Japanese positions. Enemy ships continue to slowly bombard Japanese positions with artillery fire. The decisive battlefields for the two armies are currently along both banks of the river flowing through the central part of Balikpapan and in the vicinity of the oil refinery and airfield. The Japanese army is confronting the enemy's overwhelming material strength by launching a tenacious and unyielding interception battle. The enemy attacked Japanese positions near the airfield on the 9th but mistakenly triggered Japanese minefields, resulting in hundreds of casualties. The Japanese army seized the opportunity to launch a surprise attack and achieved considerable success. Recently, the enemy has avoided advancing along roads, instead gradually advancing through dense forest areas. The Japanese army has bravely intercepted them, destroying one enemy battle vehicle, disabling two, destroying two mortar positions, and eliminating fifty enemy soldiers on the 10th.</p>
<p>Southern Front Base, 13th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese garrison forces in Balikpapan are conducting hand-to-hand combat assaults on enemy positions in various locations, causing the enemy to fall into a state of chaos. Among them, a unit formed by Petty Officer Kokubu, Petty Officer Yamamoto, and Petty Officer Kobayashi, departed from the base on the evening of the 6th, with the cooperation of Indonesian natives, and infiltrated behind enemy artillery positions. At sunset, they swiftly assaulted the enemy positions, destroying two enemy artillery pieces with bombs, inflicting heavy casualties on enemy soldiers. Petty Officer Kobayashi, on his way back, single-handedly attacked enemy positions, destroying an enemy artillery position with a hand grenade, and gloriously sacrificing himself in the battle.</p>
<h3>Multiple B29 Bombers Attack Tsuruga and Other Areas; Mines Dropped in Wakasa Bay</h3>
<p>Osaka, 13th (Central News Agency) - Approximately one hundred enemy B29 bombers, divided into three groups, attacked the Tsuruga area around 9:45 PM on the 12th. A portion dropped incendiary bombs on Tsuruga City, while the main force dropped mines in Wakasa Bay. Additionally, approximately fifty B29 bombers invaded Ogaki around 12:00 PM, dropping incendiary bombs, causing fires in the aforementioned three cities, but the fires were extinguished by 2:30 AM on the 13th, and Japanese losses were light.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) - Approximately one hundred and forty enemy B29 bombers, starting at 11:00 PM on the 12th, attacked the Kanto region in scattered formations of one or a few aircraft. One small city was attacked for about three hours, causing fires near Utsunomiya City and in a part of the Tokyo training area, which were generally extinguished by dawn on the 13th.</p>
<h3>Japan Strengthens Air Power</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) - A naval correspondent for the "Yomiuri Shimbun" stated that after the enemy's mobile forces have been active, they have always carried out landing operations, such as Iwo Jima, Leyte, Luzon, and Okinawa. However, after the fleet carriers acted on the 10th to attack the Kanto region, there has been no new action like that of the past. The enemy is eager to obtain an airbase closer to the Japanese mainland, so it will continue to send mobile forces to attack, and we must be vigilant. The enemy's B29 bombers are attempting to eliminate Japan's will to fight and war potential, but what the enemy fears most is the reorganization and strengthening of Japan's air power. The enemy's B29 bombers hovered over the Kanto skies for only a few tens of minutes, unable to fully attack Japanese airbases, so they want to achieve their goal by repeatedly attacking with fleet carrier-based aircraft over a long period of time. However, Japan's air power, in preparation for the decisive battle on the mainland, is using the most skillful means, exists solemnly, and is being strengthened day by day.</p>
<h3>Japanese Students Manufacture Aircraft; Already Deployed to the Front Lines</h3>
<p>Chiba, 13th (Central News Agency) - It is said that a aircraft factory, entirely established by students, has appeared in a corner of Chiba City. From manufacturing parts to assembling complete aircraft, it is all done by the hands of students. The aircraft manufactured by them that have already been deployed to the front lines have reached ×× units. The staff of the school factory are students mobilized throughout the year in the ×× factory, totaling ××× people, all of whom are students and graduates of the school.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Secures Strategic Points in Southern Burma; Part of Forces Crosses the Hsedaw River and Fiercely Attacks</h3>
<p>Burma Front Base, 13th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese powerful forces defending the dangerous Pegu Yoma mountains are now guarding the strategic mountain ranges of southern Burma, preventing enemy forces from invading and securing strategic points. They are also carrying out raids on the only supply routes of the enemy forces, the Yangon-Mandalay Highway and the Yangon-Kyangin Highway, to disrupt the enemy's lines. Therefore, the enemy forces, to avoid danger, dare not move at night and only transport in large groups of hundreds of heavily loaded vehicles during the day. At the same time, to ensure the safety of the transport, they constantly use aircraft, tanks, and armored vehicles to guard them closely, and deploy tank units and armored vehicles at key points to ensure complete safety of the transport. In addition, the Japanese front-line units are active among the enemy forces and have completely contained the enemy's invasion operations. As a result, the battle line has temporarily become stalemated. In addition, the Japanese forces defending the solid positions on the bends of the Hsedaw River are also preventing the enemy forces in order to support the Japanese forces in the Pegu Yoma mountain area. They also overcame the heavy rains that had just subsided at the beginning of the month, crossed the Hsedaw River, launched an offensive, destroyed the stubbornly resisting enemy forces, and captured key enemy points 50 kilometers southwest of Kyangin, near Pegu, and 5 kilometers northwest of it. They are now fiercely attacking the remaining enemy forces. This Japanese counterattack operation represents the determination to defend Burma and is also a new threatening operation. The elite Japanese units based on the steep Shan Highlands are also preventing the enemy's advance. The enemy reports on the battle situation on this side, saying: "The battle line has been in a stalemate since a month ago, and now the battle situation is favorable to the Japanese." They try to avoid mentioning their hard fighting and the difficulty in using enemy mobile units.</p>
<h3>Rumor of Soviet-Chinese Treaty Signed</h3>
<p>Zurich, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to a United Press dispatch from Washington: According to sources with close ties to the local Soviet embassy, Song Ziwen's visit to Moscow resulted in the conclusion of a treaty of friendship between the Soviet Union and Chongqing, which has been signed in Moscow. It is also heard that the treaty did not involve territorial issues.</p>
<h3>Gu Weijun Returns to England</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to information obtained here: Gu Weijun, the Chongqing ambassador to the United Kingdom, arrived in London on Wednesday from [location missing].</p>
<h3>Wuhu Issues Rice Vouchers</h3>
<p>Wuhu, 13th (Central News Agency) - The government rice vouchers in this county were officially issued on the 12th. Because the prepared rice could not be concentrated on schedule, the distribution was halved according to the original quantity, that is, three "he" (a traditional unit of measurement) per day for large families and two "he" for small families.</p>
<h3>Agricultural Loan Branches Established in Various Counties of Jiangsu Province; Japanese Reporters Visit Su-Xi for Investigation</h3>
<p>Suzhou, 13th (Central News Agency) - Since the Jiangsu Provincial Agricultural Loan Association began operating, it has planned to promote various agricultural loan activities. The provincial government has issued orders to the county governments to organize branches, and has issued the organizational charter of the loan branches. Now, the branches have been organized and established in various counties, and the funds from the Shanghai Inquiry Committee will be loaned to farmers in urgent need of funds, in order to increase production and strengthen the economy of Chen Village.</p>
<p>Suzhou, 13th (Central News Agency) - Hirose, a reporter from the Shanghai Continental News, and Kobayashi, a reporter from the Allied News Agency, came to Suzhou on the 8th to investigate the situation of increased production and purchase of agricultural materials in the Suzhou area. They visited the directors of the Food Purchase Association and the directors of the Cooperative of the Qingxiang Area to listen to the situation of rice purchase and the current situation of the operation of various cooperatives. On the afternoon of the 9th, they visited Governor Ren of the provincial government and then transferred to Wuxi for investigation on the 10th.</p>
<h3>Special Office of the Fourth District of Jiangsu Province Reinspects Rural Areas</h3>
<p>Zhenjiang, 13th (Central News Agency) - The Special Administrative Office of the Fourth District of Jiangsu Province will conduct a second phase of inspections starting in late this month to investigate the administrative conditions of various rural areas in Zhenjiang, Danyang, and Jintan counties, in order to communicate public opinion and bring officials and civilians together.</p>
<h3>Japanese Foreign Minister Tōgō Pays Homage at the Imperial Palace</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Foreign Minister and Greater East Asia Minister Tōgō entered the Imperial Palace at 10:10 AM on the 13th to report on government affairs to His Majesty the Emperor and then exited.</p>
<h3>Britain and America Seek to Maintain a Balance of Power with the Soviet Union; Outlook for the Three-Headed Summit is Bleak</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) - It is rumored that the tripartite summit of Britain, America, and the Soviet Union will be held around the 15th at the Potsdam Palace near Berlin. The purpose of this summit is to resolve the disputes between countries arising from the partition of Germany. The results of this summit will have a very close relationship with the peace of Europe and the impact of the war in East Asia. This summit is different from past summits because the protagonists have changed. The American side was formerly Roosevelt, but now it is Truman, and whether Churchill can continue to serve as British Prime Minister is a major question. It is planned that Churchill intends to attend with Labour leader Attlee, sharing responsibilities, but even observing the previous examples of Soviet diplomacy, if the other party makes a slight mistake in making concessions, the Soviet Union will rush in, and all compromises will not be easy to promote satisfactorily. It is also universally acknowledged that Truman's skills are inferior to those of Roosevelt, and it is even more doubtful whether his recent actions have been able to gain the trust of the Soviet Union. Roosevelt was able to exert the power of the domestic parliament, but Truman clearly lacks that ability. At the same time, on the British side, the Conservative Executive Committee is reportedly in dispute in order to seek Attlee to share responsibility. Now, how can the United States and Britain send such incompetent and unauthorized representatives to give the Soviet Union trust? Looking back at the first Tehran Conference, the central issue at that time was the second front, and the post-war issue was secondary. The second Yalta Conference focused on international institutions, with operational issues attached. At this time, the American and British sides are promoting the Potsdam Conference, claiming that it is, in fact, a peace conference for Europe, because the Soviet Union still has the Black Sea and Turkish Mediterranean aspects that are problematic in the talks, and will take the usual diplomatic offensive approach of taking the initiative. Recalling the fact that after the First World War, the major powers' isolation of the Soviet Union was initiated from that aspect, this kind of Soviet approach is also a natural trend. Moreover, Italy's request for peace and treaties has been long-standing, and the border disputes of small countries in the Balkans such as Greece and Bulgaria have also become pressing issues to be resolved. It is rumored that the United States and Britain may use this meeting as a meeting to resolve the Mediterranean county case in reality, but the central issue of the meeting is to deal with the German problem and the problem of the three Baltic countries, and other undecided border issues are naturally included. In summary, the purpose of the United States and Britain in this conference and the future peace conference is how to prevent the westward expansion of Soviet power and maintain the balance of power between the three countries in Europe. However, the issue of the balance of power between the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union is not limited to the European region. Speaking of this point, the East Asian issue is especially indispensable, because the Soviet Union expresses deep concern for the East Asian issue. Regarding the Chongqing government and the Yan'an issue, Soviet domestic public opinion is commenting endlessly, which shows the Soviet Union's attitude towards other issues and other regions, still temporarily keeping its secret strategy.</p>
<h3>Chifley Appointed Australian Prime Minister</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to a Canberra report: Australian Treasurer Chifley has now been formally appointed Prime Minister to succeed Curtin.</p>
<h3>Former Italian Prime Minister Nitti Returns Home</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to Swiss radio broadcasts: Nitti, who served as Prime Minister and Interior Minister from 1919 to 1929, has arrived in Milan en route to Rome. Nitti fled the country during Mussolini's fascist regime and has always opposed fascism.</p>
<h3>Mexican Foreign Minister Padilla Resigns</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to news from Mexico City: Mexican Foreign Minister Padilla has submitted his resignation to the President and has been approved.</p>
<h3>Simla Conference at a Standstill</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) - The Simla Conference, which is discussing the British proposal for India, is currently at a standstill. This proposal is a repeat of the "Cripps Mission" of March 1942, so Mother Ning said that this conference is a concrete expression of a part of the Cripps Mission, so it is extremely dangerous to make the results of the Simla Conference decide important matters. However, the National Congress Party, which vehemently rejected the "Cripps Proposal" in April 1942, actually attended the Simla Round Table Conference convened by Viceroy Wavell, which is of great significance. However, why has the National Congress Party, which has stubbornly continued to resist the British government for a long time, suddenly changed its past attitude? We must consider the quiet changes in the past three years. The tense situation when the Japanese army was about to suppress the Indian border in the spring of 1942 is obviously very different from today's situation, in which the war against Germany has ended and the direct threat to the Indian border has been completely removed.</p>
<h3>Old Tricks to Co-opt India Resurfaced</h3>
<p>The cunning British have fully understood this international situation, so they have refurbished the old version and presented the old case again, forcing the various factions in India to agree, and the Congress Party also fully understands this intention of the British. On the 30th, Gandhi Weng also said at the Simla Conference: "The Congress Party knows that the Simla Conference is a prelude to Indian independence, so it is participating," because they know that in this situation, only attending the Simla Conference can be said to contribute to India, so they began to participate in this conference. Moreover, we expected that Gandhi Weng, who would attend the meeting together with Acharya, the chairman of the National Congress Party, would actually serve as the advisor to the Governor-General and the Congress Party, and promote the meeting outside the formal meeting seat in Simla, actively progressing. From this, we can also know the attitude taken by the Congress Party and Gandhi Weng towards the Simla Conference. Therefore, without looking at the statement of Nehru, the leader of the National Congress Party, we can clearly understand the attitude taken by the party towards the new proposal, that there is no other good strategy than to advance step by step in a down-to-earth manner. The dominant class in the National Congress Party is of the same opinion, and the attitude of the Muslim League, which is opposed to the Congress Party, is also quite noticeable.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Rectifying the Financial Market</h3>
<p>These past few days, letters criticizing the phenomena in the financial sector have been pouring in like snowflakes, urging us to stand on the side of the people, uphold justice, offer suggestions to the authorities, give sincere advice to the financial sector, and find a way for the general public to maintain their basic living standards. Most of these letters come from citizens who have suffered losses from discounted drafts and cash, but there are also many people from the financial and industrial sectors who point out the darkness and crises in the current financial sector, hoping that we will publicly disclose these letters to clarify right and wrong and to prevent some financial practitioners from suffering unjust grievances. Our newspaper fulfills its mission as the voice of the people; we will not hesitate to pursue what is beneficial to the community, as long as it aligns with justice. In principle, we should consider accepting the requests of our readers. However, in handling issues, we strive to avoid personal biases and must recognize the objective environment; otherwise, the actual repercussions may not be beneficial to the community. Therefore, we are not preparing to publish these letters for the time being, not because of a lack of a sense of justice or courage, but because we hope everyone understands this.</p>
<p>Regarding the current credit currency issue, judging from the newspapers and the statements of the authorities, we cannot say that the central and municipal authorities are "standing idly by." The authorities have indeed made efforts and are continuing to do their best to seek solutions. The promulgation of various countermeasures, the recent investigations into illegal activities in the financial market, the punishment of a large number of practitioners, and the public announcements all demonstrate the authorities' proactive spirit of responsibility. Therefore, we cannot blindly echo those who simply criticize the authorities' attitude.</p>
<p>The crux of today's problem lies not in the authorities' "disregard for the people's livelihood," but in how the authorities will solve this major problem that is threatening the people's livelihood. This is what the media unanimously regrets. For example, abolishing drafts and replacing them with bank drafts from various banks is not only a superficial solution that treats the symptoms rather than the root cause, but it is also like giving a strong purgative to a patient who is already weak, making the serious credit currency problem even more severe. After all, drafts are a form of credit currency guaranteed by the national bank, while bank drafts can be issued by any bank or money shop. Even if the authorities have various preventative measures, the following dangerous phenomena cannot be denied:</p>
<p>First, allowing various banks and money shops to issue bank drafts in place of cash, and giving bank drafts circulating value, is tantamount to acknowledging that each bank and money shop has the power to issue currency in disguise. The national bank's currency issuance was already showing signs of expansion, and it had to adopt measures such as issuing various treasury bonds and gold certificates to withdraw currency. Now, openly allowing hundreds of financial institutions to have the right to issue currency in disguise will undoubtedly stimulate the financial sector and public sentiment. This need not be elaborated upon.</p>
<p>Second, among the currencies currently circulating, the highest denomination of Central Reserve Bank notes is only 5,000 yuan (the 10,000 yuan note was just issued today), and according to the amended provisions of the newly promulgated Central Reserve Bank regulations, the highest denomination of notes issued is also only 10,000 yuan. However, the bank drafts issued by various banks and money shops can be issued arbitrarily. 5,000 or 10,000 yuan has become the minimum denomination, and 1 million, 2 million, or even 10 million is not surprising. As a result, on the one hand, the credit of bank drafts is universally devalued (even affecting the bank drafts of major banks), creating a dual-price system in the market. On the other hand, the circulation of such large-denomination credit currency will inevitably shift its negative impact to Central Reserve Bank notes, proportionally devaluing the credit value of Central Reserve Bank notes.</p>
<p>Third, the circulation of bank drafts cannot realistically be equivalent to Central Reserve Bank notes, and their denominations are not as small as Central Reserve Bank notes, making them inconvenient to use, resulting in their prices trending downwards. Those who possess large sums of money can use them to speculate and shift risks to banks and money shops. It can be said that they have one more tool to harm social finance, without any inconvenience or disadvantage. The most affected are the general salaried class and legitimate industrialists and merchants, who have no choice but to endure the pain of exchanging cash at a discount of about 20%. The salaried class can only endure this heavy exploitation, while the losses suffered by industrialists and merchants must be passed on to customers, causing prices to rise to ever-higher peaks without limit.</p>
<p>The individual punishment of 35 banks and money shops in the city this time is undoubtedly a manifestation of the effectiveness of financial inspections. However, among all the banks and money shops in the city, whether only these few should be punished, and whether it is fair, we still have doubts based on observations from various sources. To be honest, certain banks and money shops with Central Reserve Bank personnel as their background must be subjected to particularly strict inspections. If there is solid evidence of harming finance, they should be severely punished in order to deter the stubborn and achieve fairness and impartiality. As for the harm of cash discounts, it is most profound and widespread for the common people, and is simply a weapon that kills without drawing blood. Banks and money shops restrict cash withdrawals for customers, claiming that the Central Reserve Bank's supply is insufficient, but some banks and money shops inevitably take the opportunity to use this as a pretext for illicit dealings, which is also an opportunity given by the Central Reserve Bank. Moreover, there are many rumors about a few Central Reserve Bank employees engaging in cash discounts. For example, a certain level of employee can withdraw a certain amount of cash every day, and the amount they withdraw far exceeds their salary. What do these people do with this cash? Also, a certain level of Central Reserve Bank employee can withdraw cash after depositing notes, and can repeatedly discount them to reap huge profits. Therefore, strictly speaking, if the supply of cash is indeed severely insufficient, then why can it be rolled over once discounted? This shows that the cash panic is entirely man-made, especially caused by the monopoly of certain special classes. It is rumored that the Central Reserve Bank management has already discovered some illegal employees and punished them. We believe that since there is such determination and fact, the names and crimes of the illegal elements should be publicly exposed so that the public can condemn them and serve as a warning to others.</p>
<p>According to the ideals of the general public, the issue of credit currency should not have arisen in the first place. Because as long as the government is determined, it has already withdrawn drafts, and now it can further prohibit banks and money shops from issuing bank drafts (unless customers request it themselves), and the Central Reserve Bank should reasonably allocate cash to each bank and money shop, and the central government should directly bear all financial responsibilities, which would make the control of bank and money shop operations much easier.</p>
<p>However, we must state that, first, the current credit currency crisis is very deep, and the relevant authorities must think with a long-term vision, consider the interests of all the people in the peace zone, and quickly seek fair and effective countermeasures. Second, the implementation of a truly effective method will inevitably affect some people who profit from the bad system, but "why should one family cry when an entire road cries?" The authorities should have great benevolence and courage; moreover, these few people have already filled their pockets and will definitely not cry! Third, there should be stricter inspections and unified management of all banks and money shops. Bank drafts must be cashed when they mature, and new bank drafts cannot be issued. At the same time, in order to show impartiality in the allocation of cash to each bank and money shop, the Central Reserve Bank's issuing agency should consult with the banking and money shop industries and make a public decision.</p>
<p>The mission of the financial industry is to promote the prosperity of the country and society, help the entire economy be vibrant, and stabilize people's livelihoods. Therefore, the financial industry should make positive contributions, even under the restrictions of wartime conditions, but at least there should not be the opposite phenomenon of harming people's livelihood and economy.</p>
<h3>Ramblings on the European War (1)</h3>
<p>The European war is over. Looking back at the fighting situation of Germany, the Soviet Union, and the United States in Europe, we can see many extremely strange and interesting phenomena. Now, I will summarize the news from all sides and describe it as follows:</p>
<h3>Germany's War Aims</h3>
<p>First, let's talk about the Soviet Union. More than half of the Soviet Union's European territory was destroyed by the German army. When the German army retreated, it burned everything in Soviet territory, regardless of cities or villages, so the hard work of the Soviet Union's three five-year plans was completely turned to ashes. However, in combat, the Red Army took the frontal attack method. For strongholds that hindered its advance or resisted, it concentrated artillery fire to destroy them. But in places where there was no resistance, the Red Army did not attack indiscriminately. Even the Red Army's air raids were always tactical bombings. Throughout the entire German-Soviet war, the Red Army's strategic bombings were only a few times, and limited to oil fields or purely military facilities. The Soviet Air Force's bombing of Berlin was also a small-scale air raid of reconnaissance flight, so the citizens of Berlin believed that the bombing from the east was not dangerous. However, the Soviet Air Force's strength was not small. About 20,000 aircraft were gathered at the front line, which was comparable to the British and Americans.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the U.S. military's destruction of Germany had no mercy. When bombing, regardless of whether it was military equipment, residential areas, or historical monuments, everything that could be destroyed was their bombing target. Their reason was to dampen the German people's will to fight, but they knew that such actions had little effect. Therefore, their true intention was clearly to completely destroy European culture.</p>
<p>After Berlin was bombed several times, two houses on Mingxing Street miraculously remained undamaged, proudly standing among the ashes. However, not long after, the American planes discovered them, and specially flew to bomb them, concentrating large bombs. As a result, these two houses could not escape the fate of being turned into piles of rubble. Another example is Dresden, which had no military equipment and no munitions factories. Since ancient times, it has been a peaceful city of academics and medicine, so everyone guessed that American planes would not visit and drop bombs. Who knew that after they had destroyed all the German cities, they finally flew to bomb this peaceful city. With one strike, the city was destroyed, and 200,000 citizens were killed or injured. Today, within Germany, there is probably no city with a population of more than 50,000 that can be preserved. Even small towns with more than 10,000 people can hardly escape this disaster. For example, Klenzwou, a small town on the Otter River with a population of only 12,000, was the site of the last fierce battle between Germany and the Soviet Union, and before it was occupied by the Soviet army, the American air force arrived first and destroyed it in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>However, even though the situation was like this, Germany claimed that its war aim was: first, to remove the threat from the Bolsheviks in the east. So it loudly called for the formation of an anti-Soviet crusade, and advocated long-term unity with the so-called democratic countries to establish a common front. When Germany had not yet surrendered, it even hoped to compromise with Britain and the United States and continue the war against the Soviet Union. However, in actual combat, perhaps due to geographical conditions, the V1, V2, and other new weapons were completely used to deal with Britain and the United States. This is truly an incredible phenomenon.</p>
<h3>Katyusha Rocket Launcher</h3>
<p>If we look at the quality of weapons, the reason for Germany's failure can be specifically pointed out as the Soviet Union's tanks and the British and American air forces. Hitler, who prided himself on Germany being the most scientifically advanced country, also praised the Soviet Union's tanks, saying that their quality and quantity were quite impressive. And especially among the artillery used by the Soviet Union, he thought the newly developed Katyusha cannon was particularly terrible.</p>
<p>The Katyusha cannon is composed of more than a dozen small rocket launchers linked together. As long as the trigger is pulled, dozens of rocket shells will hit the same target at the same time. No matter how strong the position is, it can be destroyed in one fell swoop. It is indeed a terrible new weapon. The name Katyusha is not the heroine in Tolstoy's famous book "Resurrection," but the name of a Soviet woman who stood up in front of the guerrilla forces and fought bravely when the German army occupied European Russia. Like the French Joan of Arc (Jeanne darc), she established many merits in the bloody battle to defend her country. Therefore, in order to forever commemorate her merits, the Soviet authorities named this new type of cannon after her. They also specially made a "Katyusha Song" and sang it all over the country.

<h3>Municipal Government Orders Economic Bureau to Strictly Prohibit Rice Manipulation; Close Attention Paid to Merchants Stockpiling at Any Time</h3>
<p>Since the Municipal Economic Bureau was ordered to abolish the emergency measures for rice control, it has been paying close attention to the hoarding and manipulation of rice by merchants in the city. Recently, the Municipal Government issued an order stating that "at the beginning of the opening of rice transportation, it is feared that a small number of merchants will take the opportunity to hoard rice, and that the主管官署 in various places will restrict the flow of rice under the pretext of maintaining food supply within the territory." It has been notified to the relevant agencies to effectively prevent these situations. In order to make the above-mentioned measures more effective, the Municipal Government has ordered its subordinates to strictly investigate and prohibit merchants from hoarding and manipulating rice, and from restricting its circulation under the pretext of any reason, in order to eliminate abuses and emphasize the importance of orders." After receiving the order, the Bureau, considering that the case is related to the people's food supply, in addition to ordering its subordinates to strictly investigate and prohibit such activities, it has also been paying close attention to the hoarding and manipulation of merchants at any time.</p>
<h3>Improvement of Prison Sanitation Committee Holds Second Meeting Yesterday; Discussion of Various Implementation Plans</h3>
<p>It has been reported in this newspaper that Shanghai's prisons were previously overcrowded and the weather was gradually getting hotter. Wu Songfeng, Minister of Judicial Administration, and public-spirited individuals such as Li Sihao, Lin Kanghou, Chen Binhe, etc., initiated the fundraising of a fund for the improvement of sanitation, and organized a management committee. On the afternoon of the 12th of this month, the committee convened another meeting. In addition to the heads of judicial organs, members such as Lin Kanghou, Chen Riping, Chen Binhe, Kong Xianyi, and Yuan Rongchang (substituting for Section Chief Guo) also attended. The meeting was chaired by Minister Wu, who discussed the implementation plan for improving sanitation, urging prisons to actively cooperate with the Municipal Health Bureau to carry out measures such as adding doctors and nurses, adding medicines and sanitary equipment, changing clothes and bathing, and large-scale disinfection. Yuan Jufan, Director of the Health Bureau, was also hired as a member. All funds are deposited in banks, and interest is used monthly for permanent use. The discussion on the issue of prisoner rations lasted for a long time. It was generally agreed that the supply of food was difficult. At present, five合口 rations are provided, with four合 of mixed grains (麫頭) mixed with one合 of rice. This may affect the nutrition of prisoners. It is hoped that the distribution can be expanded in the near future to alleviate the prisoners' plight. Since Wu has been in charge of justice, he has been working hard to improve the welfare of prisoners, which is a great blessing to them.</p>
<h3>Police Bureau Adjusts Personnel Selection for Branch Bureau Chiefs</h3>
<p>The Municipal Police Bureau has made adjustments to the personnel selection for branch bureau chiefs and section chiefs. Xu Minshou, chief of the Laozha Branch Bureau, is awaiting other assignments. The vacant position will be filled by Guan Tiehuan, chief of the Penglai Road Branch Bureau. Rong Hanyi, chief of the Zhabei Branch Bureau, will be transferred to the Penglai Road Branch Bureau as chief. The vacant position will be filled by Chen Xixian, deputy section chief of the Second Division of the Security Section. At the same time, all chiefs and deputy chiefs of branch bureaus must reside in the bureau to handle official duties.</p>
<h3>Adjustment of Section Chiefs of Three Sections of Branch Bureaus</h3>
<p>There are also adjustments to the section chiefs of the third section of each branch bureau. Shang Wu, chief of the third section of the Huashan Road Branch Bureau, will be transferred to the Yimiao Branch Bureau as chief of the third section.

<h3>Reorganization of the Security Police Brigade</h3>
<p>In order to refresh the organization and strengthen security forces, the Municipal Police Bureau reorganized the establishment of the three brigades under the Security Police Brigade. Each brigade is divided into three companies, each company is divided into three platoons, each platoon is divided into three squads, and the number of police officers in each squad is set at twelve. The original first, second, and third companies are still under the first brigade. The fourth company of the original first brigade is transferred to the second brigade. The second company of the third brigade is changed to the fifth company of the second brigade. The sixth company of the second brigade is reorganized. The original tenth company is changed to the seventh company of the third brigade, and the eleventh company is changed to the eighth company of the third brigade. The ninth company is still the ninth company of the third brigade. The companies under each brigade are formed by the existing personnel. The sixth company will be organized separately. In addition to selecting two police chiefs and four police officers from each of the original companies to immediately establish the sixth company, the remaining shortfall will be filled by the company itself.</p>
<h3>Ninth Phase of Low-Priced Coarse Grains; Price List Announced</h3>
<p>The city has organized eight phases of low-priced coarse grains. It is learned that the price list for the ninth phase has been submitted by the Coarse Grain Industry Association to the Economic Bureau for approval and publication. The total price of five catties of low-priced coarse grains sold from the 13th to the 15th of this month is listed below:</p>

<h3>Finance Bureau Revises Valuation of Cattle, Sheep, etc.</h3>
<p>The Municipal Finance Bureau has revised the valuation of cattle, sheep, and other items for the Livestock Business Special Tax because the selling prices of cattle, sheep, and other items on the market have recently increased, and the original valuation of the bureau is no longer consistent with the current actual situation. After referring to the market situation, it has been readjusted and revised. The valuation of each head of yellow cattle, buffalo, donkey, and horse is 600,000 yuan, and the tax is 30,000 yuan according to the prescribed tax rate of 5%. The valuation of calves is 80,000 yuan, and the tax is 4,000 yuan. The valuation of goats and sheep is 40,000 yuan, and the tax is 2,000 yuan. It is reported that it has been submitted to the municipal government for record and public announcement, and the tax will be collected uniformly according to the new valuation from July 16th of this year.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Police Headquarters Reissues Residence Permits and Special Passes</h3>
<p>The Japanese Military Police Headquarters in Shanghai officially announced today (14th) that all residence permits and special passes issued by the Japanese Military Police Headquarters in Shanghai must be renewed seven days before the expiration of the said residence permits and special passes in accordance with the regulations promulgated on April 21, 1945. Those who wish to continue to obtain this residence permit and special pass must apply to the Foreign Affairs Section of the Japanese Military Police Headquarters in Shanghai for renewal, and submit a letter stating the reasons for obtaining the residence permit and special pass, and must complete all application procedures seven days before the expiration of the residence permit and special pass.</p>
<h3>Central Reserve Bank Starts Issuing 10,000 Yuan Notes Today to Meet the Cash Needs of the Market</h3>
<p>In view of the continuous rise in prices recently, the value of goods requires several times more currency in circulation. In addition, speculators hoard materials and unscrupulous financial institutions try to make profits by discounting cash, causing the demand for cash to become increasingly scarce. In order to solve the difficulty of cash demand and eliminate the abuses of discounting, the Central Reserve Bank has, on the one hand, inspected the business of financial institutions and cracked down on attempts to make profits by hoarding and discounting cash. On the other hand, it has decided to issue new 10,000 yuan notes starting today (13th) in order to smooth circulation and meet the cash needs of the market. The issuance of this new note will not stimulate prices, because it is an urgent need at present. The notice of the issuance of new notes by the bank is recorded as follows: "This bank will issue a 10,000 yuan note of the 33rd year version in gray-brown color from today. The front side is printed with the portrait of the Founding Father in the center, with the red note number printed on the upper left and right, and the seal of the president and vice president of the bank printed on the lower left and right. The back side is printed with the image of the Founding Father's mausoleum in the center, with the Western signatures of the president and vice president of the bank printed on the lower left and right. This 10,000 yuan note is universally valid with all kinds of notes issued by this bank. This is hereby announced."</p>
<h3>Second Phase of Epidemic Prevention Injections Scheduled to Begin</h3>
<p>The Municipal Epidemic Prevention Committee held its fifth standing committee meeting at 5:00 p.m. on the 12th in the Municipal Government Conference Room, and welcomed and sent off the new and old deputy directors. Those present included: Colonel Katsuyama Susumu of the Marine Corps, Major General Shibata Toshio, Lieutenant Colonel Sakai of the Fuji Detachment, Technician Matsuzaki of the Embassy, new deputy director Yuan Jufan, Chen Zongxian, director of the Central Epidemic Prevention Office, Shen Guanzhun, advisor of the Municipal Government, Nagai, advisor, Yoshiaki Tashiro, director of the Jianghai Customs Quarantine Station, Chen Yitong, secretary, and more than 20 other people. The meeting was chaired by the new deputy director Yuan Jufan. First, Secretary Chen Yi expressed a welcome speech to the new and old deputy directors. Subsequently, it was discussed and resolved that: the second phase of epidemic prevention injections will begin on July 21. The municipal government will be requested to issue a public announcement encouraging the public to voluntarily request injections in order to prevent the invasion of epidemics. Several teams of mixed teams for forced injection and inspection will be organized to work on the streets. Citizens who do not have permits will be given forced injections. At the end, the chairman expressed his views, stating that: this year, due to various reasons, the possibility of the occurrence of epidemics is particularly strong. If we do not take careful precautions in advance, the losses will be unimaginable once it unfortunately occurs. Therefore, on the one hand, we must step up the injection work, and on the other hand, we must crack down on substandard cold drinks and food products, without the slightest relaxation, in order to achieve twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<h3>Edible Oil Industry Should Abide by Agreed-Upon Prices</h3>
<p>The city's edible oil industry has recently received orders from the authorities regarding agreed-upon edible oil prices. The price has been set at 6,000 yuan per city catty (approximately 500g). All edible oil retailers should uniformly comply and not exceed the agreed-upon price, nor should they refuse to sell.</p>
<h3>Establishment of Municipal Government Salt Warehouse</h3>
<p>The Government Salt General Warehouse under the Salt Affairs Administration of the Ministry of Finance has recently been ordered to close. The Ministry has established another Government Salt Warehouse in Shanghai, appointing Liu Qian'an as warehouse director and Zhang Qingyu as deputy warehouse director. Preparations for establishment have already begun.</p>
<h3>Gold Securities Market Situation</h3>
<p>Yesterday, both the matured and fourth-term gold securities rose significantly compared to the previous day. The prices are recorded as follows: Matured securities, 4 million yuan, up 355,000 yuan per lot. Fourth-term securities, 4.05 million yuan, up 510,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Methods of Fundraising for Student Aid: A Hope for General Students</h3>
<p>Although the student aid recipients of this newspaper's student aid fund are over 3,700, this is still a very small number compared to the total number of students in schools of all levels. The number of non-recipient students in schools at all levels is dozens of times higher than that of recipient students. However, their educational opportunities should be equal. Because of the vast differences in family economy and living environment, poor students, even with talent and diligent study, still find it difficult to overcome their current difficulties! Therefore, we sincerely ask the general students to have absolute sympathy for the poor students, to show a kind heart for relief, and to demonstrate it to everyone with facts.</p>
<p>The so-called factual demonstration refers to economic assistance. For example, the "special fundraising" campaign for student aid currently being promoted by this newspaper is an excellent opportunity. Please come to our office to pick up printed materials and actively solicit donations from friends and relatives to complete the 300 million yuan goal as soon as possible. This will ensure that thousands of poor and excellent student aid recipients do not drop out of school, and that the country and society avoid suffering a huge loss. "Heaven helps those who help themselves." May you all consider these words carefully!</p>
<h3>Ninth Session of the Shen Bao Reader Student Aid Special Fundraising Team</h3>
<p>Ordinary Team 24th Team: Anonymous Team, 200,000 yuan. 25th Team: Liang You Team, 100,000 yuan. Total collected above 300,000 yuan, bringing the grand total to 6,299,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Student Aid Tennis Exhibition Match: Famous Players to Appear: Held Tomorrow at 3:00 PM</h3>
<p>The Student Aid Tennis Exhibition Match, organized by the China Practical Tennis Club, will be held tomorrow from 3:00 PM at the club's tennis court at 285 Wuyuan Road (Zhao Zhujiao Road). The scheduled program is exceptionally exciting. Champion athletes, both male and female, from this city will all appear to contribute to the student aid movement. Movie star Li Xianglan will also be present to serve the opening ball, making it a very rare event. The entire program includes seven exhibition matches, with the most exciting being the men's singles and doubles exhibitions. The singles exhibition between Wang Wenzheng and Tao Guanqiu can be said to be a battle for the championship of men's tennis in this city. Tao and Wang's skills are well-known and will certainly be an extremely exciting performance. The doubles pairings are also well-matched. Xu Chengwei, a national team player, has made significant progress in his skills, reminiscent of his father, Xu Chengji. Tickets are divided into two types: honorary tickets for 50,000 yuan and ordinary tickets for 20,000 yuan. Those who love tennis and have not seen great performances for a long time, why not come? Tickets are also sold at the social service department of this newspaper, but the number is limited, so first come, first served.</p>

<h3>Director Yuan of the Health Bureau Discusses Future Policy Guidelines: Intensifying Epidemic Prevention and Strengthening Air Raid First Aid</h3>
<p>The Municipal Propaganda Office held a regular press conference at the Municipal Government yesterday (13th) at 10:30 AM. The newly appointed Director Yuan Jufan of the Municipal Health Bureau attended and answered questions from reporters from various newspapers regarding health administration, public health, treatment institutions, and air raid first aid in detail. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Four Major Guidelines for Health Work</h3>
<p>(Question) The Health Bureau's central tasks in the future, which you, Director, have decided to be: 1. Garbage disposal; 2. Intensifying epidemic prevention; 3. Strictly cracking down on cold drinks and food products; 4. Air raid first aid. Can you tell us about the implementation plans? In particular, when will the accumulated garbage in various places during the summer season be cleared? (Answer) Regarding the above four major guidelines, they are the central tasks after I took office. Except for the garbage and the crackdown on substandard food, which will be answered in questions four, six, five, and eight, I will first talk about intensifying epidemic prevention and air raid first aid. Based on experience, epidemic prevention work needs to be intensified every summer to prevent cholera from occurring and spreading. Therefore, promoting citizen participation in epidemic prevention injections is an important task. If the situation requires it, mandatory injections should be resolutely implemented. At the same time, personnel engaged in epidemic prevention work should be ordered to be self-disciplined and to redouble their efforts in their respective positions. The Bureau also plans to make full use of the beds in municipal isolation hospitals and private epidemic hospitals to accommodate patients in the event of an epidemic. However, it is known that municipal and private epidemic hospitals currently have only about 500 beds, which will not be enough when necessary. In order to prevent the possible occurrence of epidemics, the Bureau will actively formulate plans for accommodating patients and promote them in order to prevent problems before they occur. As for the issue of air raid first aid, it is also one of the important tasks at present. In the event of an air raid, the mortality rate will definitely be high. The Citizens' Air Defense Headquarters already has a first aid plan, but in order to alleviate the suffering of the citizens and reduce the mortality rate, the Bureau is also preparing for the future. On the one hand, the relevant department is ordered to formulate an air raid first aid and accommodation plan; on the other hand, the Bureau is actively strengthening and enriching air raid treatment work in order to make full use of municipal and private hospitals when necessary.</p>
<h3>Refusal to Treat Patients by Hospitals is Illegal</h3>
<p>(Question) How many institutions are affiliated with the Health Bureau, and what is the status of their work? (Answer) The Health Bureau can now be divided into two points: First, health administration, its affiliated institutions, including the five district health offices in the east, south, west, north, and center. Second, treatment institutions, including Chang'an Road, Hubai, Huxi, Huna, and other isolation hospitals, Shaoxing Road Hospital, Pudong Hospital, Xiaosadu Road and Fanwangdu Hospitals, Gongji Hospital's Clinic, Hongzhen Clinic, and many other places. Other hospitals and clinics in the suburbs have been directly placed under the command of the counties and districts, and the Bureau is responsible for supervision.</p>
<p>(Question) Major hospitals in this city refuse to treat poor patients. Even in the case of emergency, hospitals require payment of a large amount of consultation fees before treatment. Such hospitals that disregard human life are like empty shells. What does the Health Bureau plan to do? (Answer) The Bureau attaches great importance to this issue and feels deeply regret for the hospitals. Asking patients to pay before receiving them is indeed a disregard for human life. There are also cases where pregnant women going to the hospital for delivery are required to pay cash and full fees. I plan to convene a meeting with the directors of the hospitals in the near future to resolve these problems and seek a thorough solution.</p>
<h3>Deadline for Clearing Accumulated Garbage</h3>
<p>(Question) The garbage in the Nanshi and Zhabei areas has not been completely cleared. In particular, the amount of feces and urine in various open spaces continues to increase. Not only does it stink, but it also breeds flies and mosquitoes, which poses a major threat to health in the summer. Does the Director have any concrete measures to deal with it? (Answer) Regarding the garbage problems in the first, fourth, sixth, and eighth questions, I will now answer them together: The current serious situation of garbage accumulation can be said to be the most common and basic problem in public health. What is common and basic? The most common thing is that the garbage is shipped out as soon as it arrives at the dock, and the problem is solved. The most basic thing is that if there is garbage accumulation on the road, the citizens will have a special impression and feeling. This is the basic problem in public health. The current accumulation of garbage in several places and the large accumulation at various garbage docks are due to the failure of ships to arrive and transport garbage at any time, and the abnormal dispatch of ships, resulting in the docks being full and the vehicles piling up in designated directions and areas. This is purely because the garbage has no way out, and it is definitely not the result of the cleaners' ineffective work. In the future, the way out is to improve the adjustment of ship rentals. Regardless of old or new garbage, except for the special circumstances of Maigen Road and Rihui Port, the rest can be completely cleared within one month after the contractor is determined. According to the investigation, the problem of garbage and feces in the North and South cities is not limited to the North and South cities, but also exists in the central area. We will do our best to deal with it as much as possible. In particular, indiscriminate urination and defecation will seriously affect public health. We sincerely hope that all citizens will respect themselves and strictly control themselves. At the same time, we plan to contact the Municipal Police Bureau to seek comprehensive suppression.</p>
<h3>Strictly Cracking Down on Unhygienic Food</h3>
<p>(Question) There are food vendors everywhere on the streets, most of which have no sanitary facilities. Should the Bureau formulate measures to crack down on them to make them comply with summer hygiene? (Answer) The Bureau has launched a comprehensive campaign to crack down on such substandard food. For example, 5,427 catties of natural ice, ice cream, colored water, jelly, sour plum soup, peeled fruits, and sugarcane that have been found to be unhygienic during recent inspections have all been sold and destroyed, because these food products do not meet the Bureau's regulations and are mostly rotten. If eaten, they can cause diarrhea and illness in mild cases, and spread diseases in severe cases. Most citizens are at risk of being infected. In order to protect the health of the citizens, the Bureau will not condone a few vendors and affect the health of the majority of citizens. In the future, we will strictly crack down on vendors.</p>
<h3>Gradually Improving Health Institutions</h3>
<p>(Question) How do you feel about being the new Director of the Health Bureau? Can you tell us about the future policy guidelines? (Answer) The central tasks of the Bureau have been detailed in the previous answers. However, I now feel that the health administration structure is still not simple and unified enough, and I plan to gradually improve it in the future. (Question) The air-raid shelters dug along the roads are accumulating rainwater and breeding mosquitoes. We would like to ask the Bureau to inform the citizens to order nearby residents to clear them at any time to protect the health of the citizens. (Answer) The Citizens' Air Defense Headquarters has formulated detailed measures for the management of air-raid shelters. In the future, the Bureau plans to contact the Bao Li Office and the Air Defense Headquarters to task the Bao Jia with ordering residents to clear the rainwater at any time to prevent the breeding of mosquitoes.</p>
<h3>Summer Education Lecture: The Third Lecture Tomorrow Morning</h3>
<p>The "Education Lecture" organized by this newspaper's Obligatory Education Association is scheduled to hold its third lecture at the Yucai Middle School Auditorium at 445 Shanhai Guan Road at 9:00 AM on the 15th of this month. Mr. Lin Handa will be invited to speak on "How to Reduce Fatigue." It is hoped that all primary school teachers will attend on time. There are still many seats available for auditors.</p>
<h3>Two Hospitals Give Preferential Treatment to Poor Patients</h3>
<p>Baoli Hospital: Baoli Hospital, which has been preparing for several months, is scheduled to open at 10:00 AM on the 15th of this month. At the same time, the naming ceremony of "Mo Jun People's Obstetrics Room" and "Shu Ru Infant Room" will be held. The hospital treats internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics, dentistry, ophthalmology, otolaryngology, and charges only 100 yuan for outpatient visits, and provides free treatment for poor patients. The People's Obstetrics Department was established with donations from Ms. Feng Mojun to serve poor pregnant women and charges very low fees. Pregnant women in the Hongkou district can apply directly to the hospital at 812 North Sichuan Road for hospitalization and delivery (telephone 44012). Schools and organizations that need free physical examinations can also apply to the hospital's social service department.</p>
<p>Chengji Hospital: Chengji Hospital, located at 50 Dengmei Road (intersection of Huage Nie Road), treats internal medicine, surgery, gynecology, and pediatrics. It provides medical treatment and medicine all year round. It has free diagnosis and medicine vouchers. Poor families can pick them up from the following locations: Social Service Department of this newspaper, Social Service Department of Xinwen Bao, Buddhist Fellowship, Taishan Road Moral Bookstore. Consultation hours: 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM.</p>
