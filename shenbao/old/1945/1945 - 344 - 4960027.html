<h3>主席蒞臨華北感奮　軍政各方皆積極努力</h3>
<p>〔中央社北平十七日電〕主席蒞北平，華北民衆，至爲感奮，對於軍政各方面，均有良好之反應。主席十四日在懷仁堂召集各部門負責人訓話時，除對接收人員及接收情形，有所指示外；對於市容一節，認爲前後六次蒞平，以此次對市容之印象爲最壞。此固由於日人佔領期內，毀損　預所致，但吾人接收後，未能根據新生活整齊淸潔之原則，予以掃除整理，實爲主要原因。主席在訓話中，指示厲行新運，由公務人員切實作起，以爲人民之倡導。主席之訓話，在此方面已發生迅速之影響，警備司令部於翌日第八次治安會報中，即決定：（一）軍政黨團，定期聯合舉行淸潔運動，由各該部門分別負責，督導掃街一天。（二）自行軍·人力軍·三輪車停放時，應求整齊；行進時儘可能排列成行，以免擁擠。（三）各城門洞內之沙包，由部隊加以整理，不必要者，予以撇除。（四）城門關閉時間，向後延展。在經濟方面，主席對於接收人員，於接收敵偽經濟機構，生產事業後，未能互相配合妥適利用，至爲痛心，認爲係勝利後之最大恥辱。在訓話時，曾指示各部門負責人員，通力合作，儘速利用物資，繼續生產，糾正「接收即俘頓」之現象，各主管機關於敬聆訓示後，即積極籌劃各種國營公營民營生產事業之復工。又如平市電力之供應，因石景山電廠力量不够，向由唐山電廠用高壓綫輸送，北平近月以來，因平市烟煤缺乏，唐山高壓電綫時被匪徒破壞，平市每晚有半數以上之區域，係在黑暗中過夜生活，市民深感不便，而夜間工作之新聞界，尤爲痛苦。自主席蒞平以來，夜間雖仍有電力不足之處，但全市光明，曾未停電。據主管機關息：石景山發電力量增加，唐山高壓綫亦幸得修復，即此一小事，市民亦深感係受主席之賜，獲得光明。平市學生對於生席之愛戴，有如遠遊之子弟，不見慈祥之文兄，熱烈之情緒，於十六日太和殿前之集合訓話中，充分流露。一般人認爲係主席和他的孩子們結成一條愛的長城，實非虛語。今日街談巷議，皆以主席昨日如何愛撫　擁包圍之學生，學生如何牽衣手攬袖，爭瞻主席之風采爲談話之資料。此稱熱烈之情形，信爲任何國家元首與靑年會晤時所未有，固非盛况空前等類言詞所能形容也。</p>
<p>〔合衆社北平十七日電〕此間人士，對於蔣主席及其夫人之平民化行動，表示欣訝。中外各界曁報界方面，莫不以此爲論題。主席伉儷抵平之翌日，微服就餐於一中國餐室，席間僅有官員二人作陪，當時雖不久即被侍者認出，彼等仍繼續飲食。嗣並與該處經理者小言數語。</p>
<h3>華北人民陳訴書　限兩星期內辦妥</h3>
<p>〔中央社北平十七日電〕蔣主席行輾秘書處公吿，接受華北人民陳訴枉曲一事，自十五日截止後，所有人民投遞之函件，均經行轅方面收集整理，但遠地寄出，日來尙續有遲到者。聞蔣主席對此極爲重視，十七日特嚴囑承辦人員，辦理此事必須迅速確實，謹愼周密，務須從速將全部陳訴函件，整理完畢，依其內容，分別處置，即使不能立時獲得全部結果，亦須於兩星期內，逐函妥爲答復，以伸枉曲。</p>
<p>〔中央社長春十六日電〕此間人士今午收聽蔣主席在北平太和殿對學生訓話之動態廣播，多痛哭失聲。主席訓詞，雖非對渠等所發，且未提及東北，然十四年未親主席音容之東北人士，實爲其莊嚴誠摯及充沛熱情之聲音所感動，而廣播機中之歡呼聲，亦足激發渠等之共鳴。</p>
<h3>蔣夫人在平　觀美最新式舞蹈</h3>
<p>〔聯合社北平十六日電〕蔣夫人宋美齡女士，今日下午突然蒞臨美國紅十字會俱樂部，當時留聲機上正開着一種舞曲，有人吿訴蔣夫人：「這是很好的美國吉脫白舞」。蔣夫人立即答道：「這到還不曾看見過」。軍曹吉爾斯，年二十一歲就自吿奮勇願在貴賓前表演，但舞伴很是難找，後來找到了一位曾在緬甸服務的漢敏威小姐年二十七歲，有意一試。蔣夫人才如願以償，得觀美國最新式吉脫白舞。</p>
<h3>中央訓練團即遷京　計畫改隸考試院　整軍編餘官佐將調入分批受訓</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶十六日電〕中央訓練團現正計劃列入正常行政體制，改隸考試院，與考試委員會及銓叙部並列。該團成立迄今，先後入團受訓者，已達二萬餘名，刻正進行隨同政府遷京。團址已擇定南京中山門外孝陵衛前敎導總隊舊址，範圍極廣，其組織可能超過目前三倍。整軍以後編餘軍官佐三十餘萬人，均將調入該團分批受短期訓練，再按其所學與志趣需要等標準，統籌分授實職，以充實各部門建軍幹部。</p>
<h3>水陸滑翔機　我試飛成功</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶十七日電〕中國滑翔總會敎官陳治煊，最近以中級滑翔機改造爲水陸兩用之滑翔機，十七日下午三時在復興關上試飛成功，安全降落珊瑚壩江面，此爲我國第一架水陸滑翔機。</p>
<h3>對駐平美軍脫險同志　蔣主席發表訓辭</h3>
<p>〔中央社北平十六日電〕蔣委員長于十六日在平檢閱美海軍陸戰隊後，即赴美軍電台，對美國官兵發表訓詞，即由該電台轉播華北各地及美國。茲誌訓詞全文如下：「駱基將軍，瓊斯將軍，美國海軍陸戰隊第五團第十一團，空軍第十二第二十四大隊官兵們。今天本委員長代表中國軍民，向我們盟國美國的軍民，致其熱誠友愛的祝賀。本人今天能和美國海陸空各部隊的諸位官兵見面，心裏覺得非常的快慰榮幸。美國第一師第五團的官兵。曾經參加過第一次世界大戰，著有光榮的戰績，而在第二次大戰期中，更表現了全體官兵的英勇。你們在太平洋中不斷和敵人艱苦作戰，從瓜達康納爾新不列顚而登陸琉球，攻入敵人的心臓，曾經給敵八以致命的打擊。空軍第十二第二十四大隊，曾經參加過解放菲律賓的戰役，後來協助陸軍登陸琉球，獲得光輝的戰果。今天在敵人無條件投降之後，貴軍即于今年十月初旬首先開到北平，使我國軍能如期接受敵軍投降，並積極辦理遣送敵國軍民回國事宜。今日本人能親自檢閱我們盟軍，尤其是軍容莊嚴，訓練精良的美國海軍陸戰隊，實在是無上的欣慰，正如見到我們同生死共患難的同胞手足一樣的快樂。我們於這次大戰期中，由于各盟邦共同一致並肩作戰，終于能够將我們最頑强的敵人完全摧毀，使世界和平秩序重行恢復，我們回想這一叚寳貴的歷史，就可以確信，祗要我們全體盟邦能够合作到底，就一定可以永保世界的和平，增進全體人類的福利。尤其是我門中美兩國，具有傳統的友好關係，在這次抗戰期中，由於共同流血的結果已凝結成了始終不可分割的友誼。相信在今後的國際社會中，一定更能够相親相愛，互信互助，來分祖我們維護世界和平的責任。貴國總統兼陸海空軍統帥杜魯門先生，致力于促進貴我兩國合作，本人敬祝他身體健康，大業成功。現在聖誕即將到臨，我們都準備虔誠愛護和平之主的聖誕佳節，特祝諸位官兵聖誕快樂。蔣委員長及夫人於檢閱美軍後，離開操塲時，塲外圍觀民衆。熱烈鼓掌，並齊呼主席萬歲，表示敬意。閱兵典禮完畢後，駱基將軍及華爾頓將軍設宴招待蔣委員長及夫人，並邀李主任等作陪。歡宴之後，委員長返回行轅，蔣夫人今十六日下午赴美國紅十字會婦女服務隊巡視，中美合作精神至爲充溢。受檢閱之美國官兵，無不以蔣委員長親臨授勛檢閱，引爲無上光榮，而深感興奮。</p>
<p>〔中央社北平十六日電〕蔣總裁於昨十五日下午三時，在居仁堂召見華北及東北於淪陷期間被捕脫險留平之黨員團員男女同志一百四十六人。總裁以四時須出席招待茶會，不及一一慰問，乃於點名之後，略致訓詞。大意謂各位同志，在華北東北爲黨爲國與敵僞艱苦奮鬥十餘年，有出死入生備，嘗困難，今茲相見，余衷心之快慰，何可言宣。總理有言：「革命黨員要作無名英雄」。各位同志，在此十多年中，冒險犯難，功在黨國，而至今無顯名，無高位，此稱祗盡義務不計權位之精神，實爲吾革命黨成功之唯一要素。革命黨如無若干中堅份子，以忠義氣節爲同志同胞倡導，未有不失敗者。本黨之所以能有今日，抗戰之所以卒致勝利，實有賴於各位同志之前仆後繼，犧牲奮鬥。今抗戰勝利之後，尙望各位同志，一本過去之精神，先天下之憂而憂，後天下之樂而樂，爲同胞效力，爲黨國盡忠，以達到吾人實現三民主義之目的。余今敬爲死難同志致衷誠之默禱，爲脫險同志致誠摯之慶賀，並爲革命前途預祝成功。總裁致訓時，詞意懇切，有如父兄之對子弟，男女同志有感激泣下者。</p>
<p>〔木報訊〕舊金山十七日廣播稱：馬歇爾將軍今抵檀香山，同日繼續首途赴華。馬將軍抵檀香山時，曾獲杜魯門總統之電文，杜總統在電文中表示，深盼馬歇爾將軍儘其可能，完成此次歷史上之偉大使命。</p>
<p>〔聯合社檀香山十六日電〕新任美國　華大使馬歇爾將軍乘飛機赴渝　新，於今日到達此間希康飛機塲，同行者有秘書赫開。據馬氏吿記者：除天氣甚佳外，其他無可言述。</p>
<h3>馬歇爾抵檀香山　杜魯門宣言各方反應甚佳</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十七日廣播稱：美總統杜魯門闡明對華政策後，美國務院表示擁護，中國方面之反應亦佳。中國政府發言人宣稱：中央政府完全同意杜總統所闡明之政策，建立民主而團結之新中國，實爲中國政府之素願</p>
<p>〔合衆社北平十七日電〕此間接近委座方面及華方各界人士，對於杜魯門總統之對華政策聲明，均以最高之評價予以贊許。僉以此項聲明，可加强蔣主席於國共談判中之地位。</p>
<p>接近委座方面人士，對於杜總統所指「一黨政府」之言解釋謂：國民黨諸領袖自知，現政府在機構上並非民主化；但僅係一過渡的「預備政府」；並力言雖曾屢次延期，此久候之全國代表大會，終將於五月間召開，以制定憲政。</p>
<p>國民黨各界，一致譴斥共黨阻礙中國之團結統一，聲稱：政治協商會議因延安方面遲不派造代表赴渝，已兩度延期。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十六日專電〕杜魯門總統對華政策聲明發表後，國會方面之反響，迄今咸表贊同，均認此聲明，業已澄淸美國對華之政策，並盼馬歇爾元帥籍此一聲明，及其所得詳細之訓令，將能順利完成其使華之使命。</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約十七日專電〕杜總統聲明，顯欲美國人民得有明智之瞭解，將能獲得普遍之贊許，然或許不能使美國國內要求採取「不干涉中國」政策之左翼人士滿意。此等左翼人士，尤表反對者，厥爲總統對於美海軍陸戰隊留於華北之理由。左翼人士對總統聲明之反對，反將進而廓淸美對華政策之一般誤解。</p>
<h3>協商會即將召開　軍事問題準備澈底討論</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十七日廣播稱：中國共黨代表抵渝後，本日往訪中國政府代表，交換意見。</p>
<p>〔合衆社重慶十七日電〕政治恊商會議，可能於聖誕節舉行，過去七十二小時之政軍局勢，顯對中央政府轉趨有利。宣傳部長吳國積之談話，可以代表政府各界對內戰結束有望之樂觀情緒。渠稱：於蔣委員長自平返渝後，政治協商會議即將舉行。衆信馬歇爾將軍旣定二十日履任，則可能及時趕到，以覩此歷史性會議之開幕。</p>
<p>〔衆社重慶十七日電〕宣傳部長吳國楨稱：政府正擬組織一聯合政府，使共黨得參加內閣，並被任命爲其他高級官職。吳氏指稱：本年九月二日蔣主席曾吿毛澤東，如國共能捐棄政治成見，謀得協議，最高國防會議可改組爲全國最高政治會議，使共黨根據寬闊之民主基礎參加政府。</p>
<p>〔合衆社重慶十七日電〕共黨第八路軍總參謀長葉劍英將軍抵渝參加政治協商會議，使中國政界大感興奮，認爲實現中國全面和平之前途，較日本投降以來之任何時期更爲明朗。政府發言人對中國共產黨代表團包括代表七人與隨員三十五人一點，亦表滿意，並認葉劍英將軍之親自出席，可使雙方軍事問題獲得更澈底之討論。共產黨發言人宣稱：「吾等希望在政治協商會議舉行以前及會議時期中，停止作戰，俾可談判一切，蓋中國需要者爲和平統與一」。</p>
<p>〔聯合社延安十七日電〕中國共產黨黨綱，在此次政治協商會議中，必將提付檢討，實際未脫離中共主席毛澤東所一再宣布之方針。聞共黨已將新憲法草案携赴重慶，主張立即成立臨時聯合政府。</p>
<p>〔聯合社延安十六日電〕政治恊商會議共黨代表四人本日飛渝，毛澤東朱德新送行，毛氏寄以熱烈期望。共黨代表七人，以周恩來為首，其第七名為廖承志。周恩來臨行時稱，對政治協商會議滿懷「希望」，且覺解決中國問題，捨和平會議外，別無他法。對於杜魯門宣言認爲「好而歡迎」。</p>

<p>〔合衆社重慶十七日電〕共軍已放棄包圍綏及包頭，向綏省東部撤退。</p>
<p>〔中央社歸綏十六日電〕圍攻綏包共軍，現沿平綏路分地集中，其在包頭者，則向歸綏以西九十華里及六十華里之察素齊，畢克齊兩地集中，千五日下午三時，國軍已將薩縣收復，其在歸綏城郊者，連日亦向東移動，集中於平綏路旂下營車站一帶，距歸綏爲九十華里，歸以東第一站白塔至旂下營間，路軌枕木均被共軍拆焚殆盡。</p>

<h3>昆明聯大等校　昨日仍未復課</h3>
<p>〔中央社昆明十七日電〕聯大·雲大·英專·中法四校當局，爲今晨復課，曾作種種準備，並對學生勸導備至。今晨各校內均按時鳴鐘上課，各敎授亦均按時分赴敎室授課，上午學生有三五成羣上課，惟下午罷課委會複召集學生開會，反對復課，以致無人上課。現各校敎職員正開會研討應付此新發展之情勢中。</p>
<h3>國府命令</h3>
<p>〔中央社靈慶十七日電〕國民政府十七日令，特派魏道明爲中華民國簽署國際貨幣基金協定及國際復興開發銀行協定特命全權代表，此令。</p>
<h3>王外長歡宴彼得羅夫　空運國軍即開始　長春大雪在零度下十四度</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶十七日電〕外長王世杰及夫人，定十八日晚七時假外部歡宴蘇大使彼得羅夫及夫人，並邀蘇聯大使館參事米克拉塞夫斯基夫婦，一等秘書費德林夫婦，陸軍武官羅申少將，商務副代表史列耶夫夫婦，三等秘書喀皮茶夫婦及我方翁副院長文灝，王秘書長寵惠，邵秘書長力子，甘次長乃光，劉次長錯，卜司長道明暨各夫人作陪。</p>
<p>〔中央社長春十六日電〕此間十五日夜大雪，十六日晨未停，午後始漸晴　，斜陽照耀，一片銀光。據老農云：今年雪少且遲，不若往昔於十月初即鵝毛大片。然此時農作物並無不良影響。按長春降雪，此爲入冬以來之第四次，首次降雪在十一月初，爲量甚少。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十七日廣播，中國政府發言人稱，關於中國軍隊接收東北問題，中·蘇兩政府現已決定確切步驟。</p>
<p>〔聯合社北平十七日電〕今日據美國負責方面消息，美國陸軍航空部隊司令部，將令美軍駕駛員，運送國軍至潘陽哈爾濱。此項空運，將由美軍C-54互型四引擎運轍機擔任，每架可運配備全齊之步兵五十名或五十名以上，在兩星期內開始。此事已經中蘇雙方在長春談判就緒，現在待潘陽哈爾濱飛機塲先事佈置，目下則當由中國空軍及中國航空公司運輸機擔任空運任務，惟恐飛機數量不足勝任。三日前長春大雪，氣溫已降至零度下十四度，故在嚴寒之上，急宜盡力將國軍主力完成空運，以免受寒冬阻礙。</p>
<p>〔中央社長春十六日電〕昨日來長之陳良署長，將於明晨飛錦州，續與杜長官商談國軍補給問題。機陳氏告記者，此次來長，係爲同一問題，與行營交換意見。陳氏抵此之當晚，即曾與行營經委會張主委長談，本日當再度晤商。關於將來東北境內國軍之補給，包括糧秣服裝蟬藥等，中央已確定原則，全由政府負担。此類補給，尤其官兵生活用品，將一律發給寳物，以免受當地物價波動之影響，並免因就地競購而刺激物價。然地方當局如能代爲購辦，交由軍需當局統籌分配，自亦不失爲合理之辦法。現北來及準備北來之國軍，所需服裝，均已辦妥冬裝，將以駐地之氣候而有所增減。據悉：每一官兵均可發給棉俄一條，軍毯一條或兩條，皮棉軍服大衣鞋襪皮帽等全套。即將空運來長之部隊，且已分發竣事。至於官兵之薪餉，副食費等，則將按當地物價指數，作合理之規定，總期官兵喫飽穿暖，且有餘裕，一俟幣制問題解決，此問題即可隨而安定。</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶十七日電〕東北九省二市行政人員，及中央各機關東北接收人員，陸續飛平轉長春，約二十日可全部運送完畢。東北行營籌備處，原定十七日開始遷平，因連日天氣影響飛行，已展期至接收人員遝畢後出發。</p>
<p>我從廣州來　談食衣住行人口學校報紙　鄭郁郎</p>
<p>電中航機從大河機塲高升了二三千尺時，鳥瞰廣州全景，但見這珠江的三角洲，屋簷密佈，成爲五羊城底中心目標的「愛羣酒店」十二層大廈，雄峙西堤；巨龍似的珠江鐵橋，積跨河上，貫通南北兩岸交通；紅牆綠瓦，古色古香。雍容華貴的中山紀念堂，令人景仰；粵秀，白雲兩山，深冬减不了它們的靑葱，一樣地挺秀，聳臨珠海。</p>
<p>從重慶南歸，在廣州住了一個多月了，　未感到廣州特別可愛，一旦凌空，俯視這錦秀河山，却忽然生起留戀來，也許白雲故鄉重覩不久，又吿別離，限久別重逢的愛人，還未暢叙別情，又要忽忽重上征途一般吧，那時，我實在恨飛機飛得太快。</p>
<p>當飛機飛到白雲深處時，我還下望，雲山珠海，已不復觀。我在作想；河山，美麗極了，作爲一個華南最大都市的話，市政建設，還要趁着這百粵重光的時機，好好地下一番功夫。</p>
<p>談到戰後建設，在現代化的大建築物，道路，和交通之外，急務的還是首先要恢復都市的活力——人民生活與生產的活力。廣州許多烟突冒着濃烟，可惜這多是大酒家的烟突。許多大小工廠的烟突還未見烟樓。自從九月廿日華南日軍正式投降後，從粵北，嶺東，川，黔，湘，桂回來的人一天多一天。職業需求一天天急迫，目前勞力酬報還可以，勞苦階級情况還不致太壞，苦的是技工和中層書記階級。他們的就業間題急待解決。據有關當局統計，失業的已達三四萬。機器工會方面說，光復歸來，技工還大半以上未有工作，他們木來都是建設期中的主要份子喲！</p>
<p>在貴陽服務美軍機關的粵籍人員和技工約有萬人，連家屬約五萬人，現在美軍機關截撇後，他們都要回家了，而他們的生活就要靠就業來解決的。這是廣州熱鬧的外表背後一大隱憂。粵中人士極望當局在推行戰後建設中，及平扶助生產，增加人民就業，同時更望海外及省外粵人，多予投資。</p>
<p>廣州市區人口已增至百萬以上，局面一新，各方仩商雲藥，謀事與作生意，都得逗留下來，這樣一來，便造成了旅館和茶樓酒店的黃金時代。旅館因受社會局限價，房租還不算貴，比上海約低廉四分之三。可是房間一樣難找。像愛羣，新亞，白宮這一類大旅館，祗有先找得你認識而快要離去的住客，來一個「接收」，才能得一留宿之地。</p>
<p>「食在廣州」，現在仍然是不折不扣的事實。食的不特好，還且多，「多」中有兩多；一是館子多，誇張一點，平均每五家店戶中，有一家是賣食的。第二是花樣多，單是點心一項，已經包羅古今，貫通中西，調和南北。「秋風起矣，三蛇肥矣」，蛇羹目前是最當時令的珍品，不少盟軍遠道來要一嘗</p>
<p>物價之高，遠處的人必想不到。米價九月是二千二百元一担，十月漲至五千三百元，十一月六千元，現在已經八千元了。日用品，洋貨和衣服，都漲得驚人。許多從重慶或昆明回廣州去的人，都把衣物賣光，希望回廣州買回新而且便宜的，結果吃了大大的虧。廣州物價之貴，看來僅次於昆明。有人說：初期因爲僞幣被禁絕，商人提高物價，以取償損失；後因大額面的紅關金流行市面，剌激物價。最近港幣高漲，也是一新的刺激</p>
<p>交通方面，廣九直通車自十月十六日開始通行以來，尙稱順利，但因機車陳舊，路基新修，枕木殘壞，正點不悮，也要開八小時多。市內長途汽車已恢復，營業不錯。水上交通多爲機動帆船和木船，自省港綫「海珠」輪，觸雷沉沒，死乘各二千多人：省澳綫「昌明」輪爆炸沉沒，死八十餘人後，人人均有戒心，多捨海就陸，火車站有人睡着等買晨早的車票。對於輪船，輿論以爲航政當局應施行更嚴密的檢查。</p>
<p>廣州的光複路是「廣州的望平街」，大光，中山，建國，中正，前鋒，中國幾家報社都在那里，廣州光復初期有日晚報二十多家，後被當局以未取得登記瞪，勒令停刊了十多家。現在除了上述幾家報之外，還有西南，越華，七十二行商報，和前鋒晚報。洋報紙供給已絕，大家都用土報紙，平版機。因爲印刷紙張昂貴，同時當局不許在呈請登記中先行出版，所以雜誌出版不多，圖書極缺乏。</p>
<p>學校係嶺南，國民，廣州等大學都已復課。中大正待新校長王里拱接事，尙未正式複踝。中學復課者頗多，市立小學復課四十二問。但供求相差還遠，不少靑年還在負笈無門！</p>
<p>住，像一般光複城市一樣困難。因爲工料高漲，重建屋宇很少。歸來的人多，大小房東乘機發發勝利財，巧立什麼「鞋金」，「批頭」，「按租」等名目，租一間房子非先付出一大批款項不可。住儘管難，但回來的終要回來的，誰都要回去看看一別五六年的家鄕哩。（十二，十七，記於滬濱）</p>

<p>〔中央社華盛頓十六日合衆電〕華盛頓人士認莫斯科廣播伊朗亞塞爾拜然省成立「國民政府」之宣言，係對貝爾納斯及貝文造成旣成事實，僉信貝爾納斯將反對此事，因其破壞伊朗之主權，並遠反聯合國原則也。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處德黑蘭十六日電〕伊朗政府發言人本日宣佈：亞塞爾拜然省都城大不列士之守軍已向叛軍投降。又稱：大不列士西南七十五哩之魯若耶城亦已向叛軍投降。塔斯通訊社報導：亞塞爾拜然省已自動成立一國民政府，該省之議會首屆大會已選舉希瓦里任內閣總理。該省人民大會曾要求在伊朗中央政府下成立自治政權，惟塔斯社　未說明該地新政府與伊朗中央政府之關係。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十七日電〕三强外長會議昨日開會前不久，莫斯科電台宣讀大不列士來電，謂亞塞爾拜然省民主軍，又佔領該省之城鎭四十處。本社駐蘇京特派負，謂伊朗事件無疑係屬三强會議主要議程之一，貝文外相在開會前曾與英駐伊朗大使蒲拉特密談良久，謂係討論亞塞爾拜然「國民政府」成立後可能之發展者，莫斯科電台在昨日夜分復廣播，亞塞爾拜然新議會所擬「在無損伊朗國家完整之原則下，建立並鞏固亞塞爾拜然自然自治生活」之計劃。</p>

<p>〔路述社倫敦十七日電〕莫斯科電台昨夜廣播：亞塞爾拜然新議會稱國民政府，決本人民建立自治之意志，以結束人民　痛苦，故當昭吿世界，使其知悉亞塞爾拜然國民政府之存在，當以無損伊朗國家完整之原則，發展自治生活，本民族自決之原理，獲取國民生活，建立符合民意之行政機構，一方面當肅淸造成人民痛苦之負責者。自治之亞塞爾拜然仍承認仙朗中央政府之職權。惟同時亦將採取不違反自治原則之一切必要措施，爲保護自治起見，將有民團之組織，推行强迫之自由敎育，宣布採用亞塞爾拜然語言，儘可能注意國民工業之發展。爲消滅逐漸擴大之失業狀態起見，當沒收反動派大地主之土地，重作公允之分配。農民佔亞塞爾拜然人口之大部份，故當使其得以向願意出售土地之地主購買土地，支付合理之代價。爲便利農民購地起見，當由農民銀行辦理農民放款。此外爲扶助失業羣衆起見，當起草失業救濟法，並創行社會保險制度。亞塞爾拜然國民政府當尊重全體公民信仰之自由，並使所有居民均享受同等之權利，負担同等之義務。國民政府尊重各業私人財產，對改進國民地位，提高生活水準之私人企業，並當予以扶助。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敎十七日電〕莫斯科電台今晨廣播稱：外國政府在伊朗亞塞爾拜然之權利與特殊利益，當予完全尊重。</p>
<p>蘇盼與伊朗談判　美軍週內撤退</p>
<p>〔路透社德黑蘭十七日電〕紐約泰晤士報特派員稱：伊朗左翼報紙繼續高呼伊蘇直接談判聲中，又發生蘇聯政府願向較馴服之伊朗政府，作若干讓步之謠傳，據云：蘇聯政府願意使亞賽爾拜然事件，或爲兩國間之事件。惟以伊朗政府當局，一再聲稱擬根據他國保證伊朗主權之宣言，而從車國際解決，故使蘇聯此種志願無從實現。然據伊朗外交部稱：則蘇聯政府從未有希望兩國直接談判之正式建議。最近伊朗前輩政治家五人，已舉政府之令組成委員會，研究伊北問題之對策。前伊總理蓋文及孟索爾亦五人中之二。此一委員會或可被蘇聯視爲親蘇團體，而蓋文曾於一九四二年邀請美國財政專家密爾斯波博士來伊朗，故美國對其印象亦屬不惡。德黑蘭附近之美軍，可於一星期內撇退，所留者僅許伐爾斯柯潑夫少將之憲兵隊及魏特萊率領之軍事團。此外美非軍人之留德黑蘭者，僅有密爾斯波博士之第二批財政使命團及伊朗農業部等所騁之美國顧問。伊朗國內之窮困，實需要此等外專專家之協助。伊朗較有智識之民衆，咸認伊朗應有穩定試實而深得人心之政府。惟對於外國之干涉，則均表反對。且認外國勢力一日不去，則此一政府即一日不能成立。伊朗之現政府僅可代表佔全人口百分之二弱之統治階級，且政府各部多屬冗員，人數雖多，待遇菲薄，公務員竟不乏兼職者，而逃稅貪汚等情，亦層出不窮云。</p>
<h3>蘇京共黨機關報　斥英美政策　謂民主非專利品</h3>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科十七日電〕共產黨中央委員會之機關列物「布爾雪維克雜誌」，抨擊英國在埃及印度及其他殖民地之政策，以及美國責本家之帝國主義手段，略謂：殖民地政策，足以危害世界和平，蘇聯對於託治土地之分配，殊不能拖不聞不問之態度。蘇聯富使此等土地，建立足以扶助附庸民族獲得眞正解放之政權，民主主義之旗幟，已樹立在法西斯主義殘骸之上，但民主主義非少數被選擇民族之專利品，殖民地之人民，亦應有自治自決之權利。「　　雪維克雜誌」繼稱：英政　　之再向印度作種種諾言，然今日之印度人民，仍無政治權利，印度政府事實上仍毫無變更。全國具有投票權之人民，僅佔百分之十四。英國其他殖民地之情形，亦未見較佳。譬如蘇丹及埃及，英國控制蘇丹即與控制坎及無異。至於美國，有勢力份子之推動殖民地政策，並不着重於對世界作政治上之瓜分，主要目的乃在佔領經濟統治地位，以排除他人之競爭。英國之資本家在共殖民地內，樹立種種貿易之壁壘，以防止他國之分享利益。蘇聯政府對於以民主的方泆解決民族問題，夙具有效之經騐。故除非由蘇聯密切參加建立國際託治政權，不能使託治制度獲得進步之基礎。不然，託治制度，即難免勿蹈國際聯盟之覆轍，而殖民地民族，亦難期獲得最後之獨立。</p>
<h3>英暹和約談判</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十七日電〕英國與暹羅正在新加坡進行和平談判，詳情雖未能獲悉，然知英方所提條件並不苛刻。英方要求暹羅與其合作處置暹羅境內之日人並恢複英國在暹之權益，以及暹羅隣近由英方負責各土地之權益。同時復要求暹羅負担維持東南亞安全，恢復東南亞經濟之一部份責任。據東南亞總部政治顧問丹寗聲稱，英政府原可以擬就之和平條約，强制暹羅接受，然英政府並未如此進行，亦未派兵解除日軍武裝，更未强制在暹羅設立軍政府，暹羅政府仍繼續行使職權。英政府且復給予現在瑞士之暹羅國王以種種便利，使其返歸本國。按此次談判英方係由丹寗代表，還方代表團領袖爲蔡楊特氏。</p>
<h3>駐韓美軍司令　發表布告</h3>
<p>〔聯合社漢城十六日電〕美國駐韓陸軍司令霍奇中將今日宣布：如有任何黨派，公然或暗中企岡在韓國行使政權者，均將與以嚴懲。此言意在聲明聯合國軍政府爲今日韓國惟一政府，實予「朝鮮人民共和國」及其所屬軍隊或人員以大打擊。</p>
<h3>美戰後工商業　面臨良機　不景氣浪潮可避免　可入</h3>
<p>永久繁榮之境</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約十六日電〕全國工美協會近在此間業會，慶祝五十週年紀念。主席馬蕭氏發表演說稱。美國工商業面臨良機，可　國家於永久繁榮之境地。當務之急，願在增加生產，欲達到此目的，則必須鼓勵私人投資，而由政府合作。商界與政府均須使公眾有可以安心之理由，不復畏懼不景氣之傳佈，然後永久繁榮可期，生產增加後，美國將人人有工可作，而工資亦可較高，人民生活程度，於是可有增無已。</p>
<p>經濟及政治上選擇之自由，向爲美國每一公民之基本權利，亦必可繼續不變。美洲有豐富之資源·原料·人力·生產能力·及管理技術，欲增加生產減少失業，自屬可能，而首先在保證私人資本能源源投人需用職工之生產事業。至於鼓勵投資，應取下列三項步驟；</p>
<p>（一）政府所推行之政策，勿令出餘養以投資者，趦趄不前；（二）徵稅方法，仍使儲蓄者有積財可能；（三）所採行之勞工政策，勿使工炎過高，致營業收入剩餘無多，投資者無利可圖。</p>
<p>國內稅收制度應重加檢討，如個人所得稅之徴收，應以不使其喪失努力上進之志爲度。資本利得稅之足以阻礙生產者，則應予廢隊。公司營業稅應減削至不致令人沮喪，公司收入之變重徵稅亦應予廢除。</p>
<p>在最近中五年中，私人資木投入美國工商業爲數殊微，苟最後私人資本竟被排除，則美團之經濟政治制度，終必崩潰，故亟須保證私人資本之流人程用戰工之事業，實未過甚其詞。</p>
<p>近年尙有一種政策，影響還及國內，即特別權利是。此項政策，或有利於此方或有利於他方，結果　造成動盪之壓力，社會之不滿，於美國經濟及政治制度均有損害，故吾人務必去除之。特權之一爲關稅，以之爲保護工具，往往獲益者僅小部分人士，而舉國業害，且又可利用之以減少生產競爭及工作。</p>
<p>美國欲求極度繁榮，必須勿以關稅保護或增進某製造家或製造集團之經濟地位，而必須積極利用關稅，以發展並加强全國基本生產能力，關稅　應漸漸減低，俾在美國自由競爭之情勢中，生產與消費得以極度增加。但減低之比率，當以公衆之福利爲前題，庶不致於使美國國內貿易與工人就業突受影響。另一特權則沙及勞工，最近在華盛頓舉行之管理及勞工會議中，管理方面當有若干極合理之建議，但勞工方面堅欲維持現狀，一律予以拒絕。美國勞工不允接受在法律或責任上與管理者處於平等地位，不有放棄談判進行中有罷工權利或予資方勞工或公衆於發生糾紛時以任何保障，渠非「虐待勞工者」，凡有損勞工基本權利之事，固當竭力加以反對，但殊覺今日之勞工問題，當經由立法方面以解次之云。</p>
<h3>日京都地方法院　推事被褫職</h3>
<p>〔本報東京十七日專電〕京都地方法院推事石原，頃因處理近藤案件不當，而被免職。按近藤係一陸軍上尉，曾因携帶手溜彈七枚及寳劍與手槍各一而被美軍所捕。石原判次近藤罰金二百日圓，但依現行軍法，近藤應被處有期徒刑十五個月。盟軍總部並已訓令日當局不得再給予近藤以任何政府職位。</p>
<h3>近衛自殺影響日本政治　將促成裕仁遜位　內庭臣剷除殆盡更覺四顧茫茫　朝日新聞追述舊事圖為近衛開脫</h3>
<p>〔本報東京十七日電〕近衛在其急迫間寫就之遗書中，業已確認渠本人在中日戰爭中，犯有重大錯誤。一般意見，認爲此次自殺，即在表示對錯誤負資。近衛在交其次子道武遺書中稱：「此函可說明本人在過去數年早所採取之態度，」遺書上半段，謂：「自中國事件發生以來，余曾犯有若干錯誤，對於此種錯誤，余目已極爲明瞭。」</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京十七日電〕近衛自殺，對於日皇裕仁之威信及地位，實為一大打擊。各方均認此於日本皇室及政界將有重大影響。近衛本人在最後數小時，曾對於皇室前途，表示憂慮。此或即裕仁遜位之新朕兆。一部份日本人，以爲近衛自殺或即促成日皇退位之最後因素。裕仁已深切感動，當無疑義。近衛久爲日皇股肱，其噩耗之突如其來，當與麥帥指令日政府不再在精　上財政上支持神道敎，同一嚴厲。麥帥迭次通緝之戰爭犯，已將日皇左右剷除殆盡，僅餘者爲十五年來山入內庭之兩重臣。目梨本宮入獄，而內庭亦已吿急。近衛之死，更使裕仁四顧茫茫。</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京十七日電〕朝日新聞刊載前首相近衛於一九四一年十月十六日上日皇辭呈，謂陸相東條大將不允目中國撇軍，因恐影響士氣。（當時日美正在華盛頓進行談判，以撇退侵華日軍爲成立協定之先決條件。）據東條之意，茍日本向美國讓步，則美國益將囂張自誇，漫無止境，雖中國事件得暫獲解決，但不出二三年，中日關係又有破裂之虞。今雙方國內俱有弱點，故宜莫失時機，擇定日期，發動太平洋戰爭。近衛又謂曾與東條會談四次，知已無法使其改變觀點，殊覺無以副陛下託付之重，故而提出辭呈云。嗣近衛辭職獲准，立即由東條繼任。辭呈又謂，茍日軍自中國撇退，仍有與美國談判建立友好關係之可能性。茍日本投入大戰，則在中國事變猶未結束之今日，結果如何，未能逆料。自中國事變發生以來，已深感職責重大，欲更捲入大戰，殊覺不合事理。但東條深信，華盛頓會議殊少成功希望，故堅持準備作戰云。九月六日御前會議中已決定，如談判至十月中旬猶無進步，即須積極備戰。此項辭呈，於近衛自殺後公佈，顯係其親友欲證明近衛於日本被佔領後所歷次申明之言詞，即其辭職實起因於戰事問題。但同時朝日新聞社評論及近衛自殺，稱其賦性恁弱，勢必誤國，蓋即因其荏弱易使戰事爆發。一般日本人之意見，以爲當日近衛之辭職，即爲荏弱之表示。彼不能阻止東條軍閥强硬政策，而聽其爲所欲爲，實有虧重臣之責任云。</p>
<p>遺骸任人憑吊</p>
<p>〔聯合社社東京十七日電〕近衛遺骸今日循北脚南，安置私宅，任人憑吊，近衛自殺方法，係服毒而非切腹，許多日本人以其無苦痛，而加以卑視，惟在儀式方面，亦頗具「哀榮」。近術自殺之意，其妻顯亦未知，蓋伊已將行李打好，準備其於午夜限期前投獄也。近衛屍體被發現時，係服睡衣，頭下置西式枕，雙手平安地交叉於胸際，面部亦尙寗靜，死時頭東脚西，其家人爲之易以潔白日太式禮服，改置頭北脚南方向，客堂小門，有美兵三人站崗，亦循日本風俗，脫去皮鞋。近衛住宅內置有吉朋斯巨著「羅馬帝國衰亡史」及王爾德詩文集，王爾德散文一節，句子下劃有紅色綫條，想係服毒前所讀，其譯文如下：「在我們所構成的社會中，沒有我的地位，也沒有地位給我，但是在大自然中，甜密的雨絲，一視同仁，落在正直人的身上，也在邪惡人的身上。我可以在嚴石的裂縫裏，找到一個藏身之處，並且到幽秘的山谷裹，在寂靜的空氣中哭泣，不受騷擾。」</p>

<p>〔中央社東京十六日合衆電〕近衛文營係之　化鉀而死者。其秘書牛塲稱：渠雖不知近衛有自殺意，然近衛夫人似知其夫所欲爲者。麥克阿瑟元帥總部宣稱：日前首相近衛，於其寓內服毒，渠本定於今日自首於巢鴨監獄。此消息係由日本中央聯絡局通知盟軍反間謀隊者。中央聯絡局顯係目近衛之親近人士，獲此消息。據稱：渠自十二月六日被列為戰犯後，即異常煩擾憂　。</p>
<h3>聯合國會址　波士頓與舊金山　將於兩者中擇一</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十六日電〕聯合國機構永久會址·已決定設於美國，波士頓與舊金山兩地，顯為美國今日競爭此席之主要都市。中國，菲律賓及澳洲代表，已切實聲明贊成舊金山，惟歐洲各國代表則寗選擇美國東海岸之波士頓。</p>
<h3>三強會議昨再度開會　英美蘇求取諒解　會議在友好空氣中進行</h3>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科十七日電〕三强外長於昨日作預備性之交換意見後，今日下午再開會，作更具體之討論。昨日三外長及其隨員晤談殊形忙碌，會後雖未發表公報，然信會堪空氣至爲友好。</p>
<p>〔合衆社莫斯科十六日電〕三强外長今日在此舉行首次會議，由莫洛托夫任主席，美國務卿貝爾納斯，英外相貝文及其參謀人員均出席參加。據稱此首次會議，僅屬預備性質，在會議未舉行前，貝文曾與適自伊朗趕到之英國駐伊大使蒲拉特晤談。據貝文語記者稱，彼等將「依照政策原則」討論原子問題，此語暗示英美外長已第一次與蘇方商討原子問題。英外長又稱，「大會將根據現實原則，就互相關切之問題，求取諒解。我人希望能在解決世界目前各項困難間題方面，獲得進步，以便最後在聯合國機構中作更廣泛之討論。</p>

<p>〔聯合社橫濱十七日電〕美國軍事法庭由軍官九人組成，其中八人今日在陰冷黑暗之橫濱法院中開會，籌設第一次審訊日本戰爭犯事宜。被控虐待聯合國戰俘虜之日本被告五人，其生死問題皆將取決於此。</p>
<p>〔合衆社東京十七日電〕第一次日戰犯審訊，將於明日下午在此間一日本法院舉行，其時「小玻璃眼」將答曰「在罪抑無辜」？「小玻璃眼」原為日本某戰俘營之監守，其名為美國戰俘所熟稔，本名土屋，「小玻璃眼」將以　死美人九名之罪，提交九人組織之軍事法庭審辦，渠同時亦因用木板棍棒及水龍頭等物，施刑於戰俘被控。檢舉書上指控「小玻璃眼」最得意逍遣方法之一，乃迫驅盟國戰俘於兩架拷打刑具之間間，使彼等相互摑打以為取樂。</p>
<h3>世上碩果僅存的專制君主　沙地阿剌伯國王殷德　後宮佳麗成羣王子宮主多至不能確計　反對言論出版自由對猶太人惡感甚厲</h3>
<p>〔聯合社開羅十六日電〕沙地阿刺伯國王股索德，今年六十六歲，是世界上碩果僅存的專制國王。自從漠罕默德一世以後。能够統治最大的阿拉伯國家的以他爲第一人。他管轄着五百萬人民，對他們有生殺予奪之懼。</p>
<p>他不主張言論出版自由，他尤反對吸烟喝酒和賭博，並嚴禁無孔不入的影片，侵入他的領土。他利用宗敎來作政治的工具，他是一個虔誠的可蘭經信徒，每年總要到回敎聖地麥加，去朝拜一次，並且每去必帶着一大串人，裏面有他的朝臣，廚司，回敎敎主，他的「現任」和「前任」的后妃，僕役，還有他的孫兒孫女。這複雜的一羣，是西洋人看不順眼的。</p>
<p>他究有多少兒女，現尙沒有正確的記錄，相傳他曾說過：在我的少壯時期，我建立了沙地阿拉伯王國，如今老了，我要爲國家多增添人口。有人曾佔計他正式結婚生養的王子。現在活着的共有三十一位，但這個估計，後來被認爲未免太少。國王每次可娶四位王妃，而且可以時常結婚，揀選後官佳麗。</p>
<p>殷索德身高六呎四吋，聲音洪亮，富有機智，記憶力很强，而且賦性豪爽。第一次離開他的人，從無空手而去的。除猶太人外，他歡迎任何人到巴勒斯坦。</p>
<p>二年半以前，他曾說；我不知道猶太人能有什麼理由要求居住在巴勒斯坦，不錯，謨罕默德以前的數世紀，巴勒斯坦是屬於猶太人的，但以後羅馬人戰勝了他們，把他們一部份殺死，一部份驅逐於外，巴勒斯坦從在即看不到一點曾被他們統治過的痕跡。一千三百年前，阿拉伯人又從羅馬人手中把巴勒斯坦奪了過來，嗣後巴勒斯坦即成了回敎從的巴勒斯坦。上次大戰終了時，英國曾允許猶太人在巴勒斯坦聖地建立他們的家鄉。股索德憤怒地說：這將是一個不能實現的諾言，正如同阿拉伯政府答應猶太人到英國狄紋塞爾去居住一稱的空洞，耶路撒冷旣然是回敎徒，基督敎徒和猶太人的共同聖地，我們阿拉伯人不明白為什麼猶太人一定揀中了巴勒斯坦認爲適於他們居住，他們很可以另覓枝棲</p>
<h3>英美法取一致行動　將對西班牙絕交　莫斯科會議後當可有所決定</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十七日電〕英國對於西班牙之態度，在貝文外相參加莫斯科會議歸來以前，當不致有所決定。然據華盛頓與巴黎來電透露，則美法兩國或許不久即可明白宣布其對西班牙之態度。法國尤爲性急，希望能立即對於弗朗哥政府採取一致行動，如斷絕外交關係等。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十六日電〕此間外交界人士今日發表意見，謂美國將切實與西班牙弗朗哥政府斷絕關係，美國駐西班牙大使阿莫爾業已吿退，現方取這巴黎返國。據國務院中人言，其遺缺由何人繼任，尚未擬定。又據法國外交部宣布，曾請美英兩國與法國商議對弗朗哥政府絕交一事，美國務卿貝爾納斯及杜魯門總統之顧問，均力請宣明美國對西班牙政策。官塲方面有謂僅與之絕交尙嫌不足，同時應向西班牙民衆發表宣言，說明西班牙因弗朗哥所行政策，已自絕於國際之林。宣言中並應明定辦法，終止西班牙法西斯政治組織，使其能適合於聯合國機構。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十六日電〕代理國務卿艾克遜昨日與西班牙共和國前任總理尼格林博士作菲正式之會談，此為一九三九年（當時西班牙政府尚有駐美大使在此）以來國務院高級官員與西班牙共和主義運動領袖首次在國務院會見。</p>

<h3>殺害楊光泩朱少屏案　日戰犯將受審訊　太田憲兵司令罪惡滔天</h3>

<h3>漫遊羅馬巴黎　半個世界之最初屐痕</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者　朱家讓</p>
<p>國慶後三日，我終於實現了出國之願，此行由重慶出發，經過北菲，跨地中海，涉登歐洲大陸，後來又從英倫橫過大西洋，到達美國繞了半個地球，凡四大洲，在個人的感覺上，不能謂非一次豪遊。雖然任務在身，到處皆是走馬看花，但所得印象亦堪一述，尤其這回旅行適値大戰之後，和平雖已到臨，所見所聞尙多戰時現象，所謂戰後歐美，實爲由戰時到平時轉形期的一般動態。</p>
<p>從重慶出發　取道印度赴法國</p>
<p>從重慶出國第一個大站，是印度的加爾各答，這是誰都知道的。加爾各答雖處熱帶，但那時的氣候恰跟重慶相像，一點不覺得熱，更不需出汗。市容很有點像上海，而面積廣　，馬路寬闊，則又過上海，因着美國軍隊的陸續開拔，今後加城的繁榮，恐怕要受影響，但此時此地則仍熙熙攘　，非常熱鬧。大公司大商店擠滿着人，物價縱然昻貴，甚至比重慶還高，但因並無限制，自由購買，市面顯較活躍。加爾各答的物資豐富，享用舒服，以後到了歐洲，更會感覺到。</p>
<p>離開加爾各答，記得是在十月十六日，從此就開始一段長途的飛行了。由印度到歐洲，本有英國海外民航公司的班機，然因等新德里的優先證（Priorily）老是不來，臨時改乘了美國空運司令部（ATC）的飛機。搭乘ATC也得請准優先證，但美國人的效率高。沒有幾個鐘頭，新德里的覆電到了，隨即買票，那天晚上，我們就搬進了他們機塲的宿所去住，等候第二天一早啓程，這樣我們又體味得美國空運組織規模的龐大，勤務又怎樣的忙迫。機塲的範圍這般　，各式各樣的飛機一忽兒升空，一忽兒降地，簡直鬧得日夜不休，還有這些大小車輛也忙個不了，奔來逐去。時間雖已戰後，幹法還如戰時，想象他們戰時的緊張盤重，更可知其貢獻之偉在，不禁深致敬意！</p>
<p>美國的ATC組織遍佈全地球，他們的任務，就是儘速把與作戰有關重要的人與物運輸到應到的地方去。因着地區的劃分，中印緬是一區；從印度西北的喀拉蚩到西非卡薩布蘭卡的北非部分又是一區；再由地中海上歐洲復是一區。我們這次的行程即是經歷他們三個地區，所以每到一區，可能稍稍停留下米，以便查對所執優先證的等次再定啓程先後。我們的優先證不是最高，因此在喀刺蚩和開羅都被「挽留」了一時。</p>
<p>ATC運輸機　航程十六萬哩</p>
<p>ATC的運輸機，據他們自已說有一千多架，遍飛世界，航程凡十六萬哩。雖然是軍運但一切設備却與民航同樣舒適，每到一站，住所食堂弄得頭頭是道，使你絲毫不感痛苦。機塲每距城市甚遠，則有專車接送，以便觀光遊覽。至於每一機塲的設備，不說直接有關飛行的地面建築，怎樣龐大與完備，以應起落頻繁之飛行需要；即其他普通生活所需，亦殆應有盡有，無一稍示「因陋就簡」「馬虎將就。」舉例說喀刺蚩的醫院，就比我們重慶的任何醫院强上不知多少借。ATC的工作人員很多是學生應征服役，純潔和　是他們的特點。</p>
<p>自加爾各答至喀拉蚩飛八小時，續飛至開羅又十一小時，這一段完全循阿拉伯海飛，一直飛進波斯灣，過阿朋屯（人近東要口，）越伊拉克大叙利亞沙漢，而入埃及。到開羅時天還沒亮，隨便接入宿所休息。這裏全是沙漠地帶了，機塲很多建築物全國在遙遠的厚厚的沙土上。人們的皮鞋永遠擦不乾凈。</p>
<p>到埃及少不得一遊金字塔以及博物館，我們由美國旅行社導游，出了十多元美金，供給汽車及導游咒，整天兜來兜去，瞻仰這古文化的象微；這邊是尼羅河，靜靜的躺臥在不遠的地帶，這肥沃又美麗的河流，點綴着無數風帆，宛如畫圖，它孕育了埃及的文明，寫下多少燦爛的歷史；那一邊是世界聞名的沙哈拉大沙漠，體味着宇宙是多麼遼遠闊大走不蓋的路途，看不完的邊際，更恍然於人生僅是這樣的渺小！埃及的歷史博物館是世界古文化的淵藪，一座大建築裏搜藏着無止萬千的歷史古物，特別是石棺和木乃伊，最是考古學家頂名貴的資料。還有就算開羅的三大回教堂，其歷史久遠，建築偉大，亦非初料所及。開羅市面受戰時繁榮所賜，也很鬧猛，人口已逾一百萬！中心地區雖嫌馬路稍窄，但兩邊房屋俱頗高大完整，車馬喧鬧，其所擴充的新市區，更是美麗雅嫻，淸靜可愛。埃及人多數已西化，穿起西裝，但頭上尙　戴埃式圓筒高帽，很少例外。街上的咖啡店酒店不少，且多延伸在門外人行道上，邊喝邊看風景，這景象倒和巴黎一樣。埃及人似乎很幽閒，他們並不太緊張，戰事之後，除了一度險被納粹侵迫之外，因爲地處東西交界，生意相當好做，（如今還有很多物資比較便宜易買。）大體上很安定，不像歐洲一般的破落。</p>
<p>欄桿上紅旗空懸　墨索里尼舊衙門</p>
<p>從開羅直飛巴黎，一天可達，但歐洲一到冬季，氣候無常，竟使我們在羅馬停留了兩天，却又給了我們漫遊的機會；雖然趕路的心情是何等的焦急。羅馬這歷史各城過去在墨索里尼專政下，辱沒了不少光輝，但邇城市依然値得贊美而很可愛的。我們那天由機塲進城，還僅下午四點鐘，天很亮，可以看見所有風景。市容比不上巴黎這樣寬闊，但建築十分壯麗，交通十分完備特別羅馬入的藝術天才，竟似充塞着全城，洋溢乎每個角落。任何處所都美麗、令人欣賞而留連忘返。大抵歐洲的城市設計多有方塲（Sanare）類似寬闊的十字路口，羅馬竟無一處沒有碩大的雕刻像碑或巍偉的噴水池，使城市空氣調和得多麼合適與活潑。羅馬的無名英雄墓是最偉大的雕刻建築，位在中心熱鬧地區，後面靠近大門，獸塲及古劇院，這已經是殘跡了；前面貼鄰往昔墨索里尼的衙門，一座不大高却很寬外表不很壯觀內部則殊講究的建築。墨索里尼往日對民衆呌囂的洋台依然如舊，但一世梟雄而今安在了呢？様杆上只看見掛着一塊紅旗，據說裏面在開什麼展覽會。</p>
<p>羅馬的最精華區是梵蒂崗及聖彼得敎堂。我們知道梵蒂岡現在也是個獨立國，但全屬宗教淵源，情形自有不同。警察服式還是中世紀的傳統，在梵城守衛的且皆身似古矛，看去幾疑此生何世？梵城與羅馬在地理上實在連接一起，雖然確有座城，範圍很小，殊不知這裏不特至今擁有歷史的宗教文化的權威，觀其博物館的輝煌矞麗，搜藏豐富，應嘆觀止了！因爲時間的久遠空間的遼闊，梵城博物館裏每一方寸的陳列，都是代表着世界多少文人藝匠的貢獻和成就！沒有一個方寸是浪費或焉虎了的，世界任何珍奇的寳物都集中到這裏來了，我在這裏記述這間博物館的壯麗，竟不知從那一件下手，也苦難找得適當的字句去描幕，只是一句話看仳界奇珍異寳，到得梵蒂崗，便不必再　別處了。我不知是否這話太過份？觀彼得堂完成於十三世紀，也是一座最古又最大的世界勝地。內中一座彼得銅像，則爲五世紀的雕刻。義大利的建築向很出名，然亦擭助於建築材料之便易取得。歐洲人造房十都是用石所以除非人爲破壞總可埀諸久遠，恒數世紀而毫不走樣。這所聖彼得堂，尤其是個代表作，闊大的方塲，兩邊是無數長廊石柱，塲中石塔直插雲表，這是外觀，爬上大堂石級這建築縱非金裝玉琢，說來奇怪，竟也全是美磚妙石，類似珊瑚瑪瑙堆砌而成，其中雕刻滿堂，氣象萬千，確稱蓋世傑作。</p>
<p>由義大利入法境　戰後氣象格外濃</p>
<p>踏上歐洲自然是歐洲的氣象了。我這裏所說氣象，並非謂他，却指的戰後風光表現得更較逼眞了。在羅馬，因爲常時保存歷史文化的關係，除了機塲曾被炸毀以外，並未見到如何破壞的痕跡；但一般凋零和衰落之氣，却無可諱言地流露在街頭，以及每人心坎之內。大家曉得義大利自被墨索里尼闖下大過之後，如今軍備蕩然，經濟瓦解，在和平條約未經外長會議安排之前，大體上說還在盟軍當局管制之下。義國的工業在戰前也很有地位（人家的成就究猶非我們中國現狀所能望其項背，經此觀察，益增警惕。）但是戰爭帶來了破落，國民經濟現在低降與動搖的階段中。義國人的一般生活水準以衣住與行而講，其水準尙高，個個人都是衣冠楚楚，洋樓居室，出門則交通暢達；但食的亨受勢已减損。牛奶雞蛋肉類普遍缺乏，多數以人造贋品代用，物價高昂，顯見通貨在膨脹，物資鬧恐慌，黑市盛行，每一美金官價一百里拉，黑市上竟可賣到四五借。</p>
<p>過了羅馬我們就入法境了。先在馬賽降落，未得入市遊覽，但遠遠望去，馬賽依然熙來攘往。此地是平時中法交通的吞吐港，最近聞已有船開駛遠東，我國留歐學生多人將由此搭船東航經越南回國。由馬賽飛巴黎，平時不過二小時，然適値這段氣候壞極，飛行很受影響，快到巴黎的時候，飛機竟不斷震盪，幾乎呌人嘔吐，幸未幾降落，總算平安完成這一段長途的旅程了。</p>
<p>巴黎這世界聞名的大都市，如今身歷其境，果知名不虛傳，是十足標準的都市典型。巴黎以各種條件來衡量，皆要算上第一流：論氣候，不熱亦不太冷，巴黎人夏夜從來不能不蓋被，電風扇很少用；論地區，雄踞全國中心，雖稍偏北，而據交通鎖鑰，又有美麗的賽因河橫貫全市，巴黎人造了不知多少各種不同式樣的橋楔平添多少風景。巴黎已有二千年的歷史，歷代帝王始終建都於此，宮室的輝焊富麗，足見舊時王室的英威與享用；而日積月累的建設，再加近代市政的發皇，巴黎確已到了登峯造極的地步，法蘭西人天才能耐，以及其成就確也令人欽佩。</p>
<p>飛機將降低飛的時候，巴黎的烏瞰漸已予人印象一新：新市街的設計，看去全像整齊的方槐，房屋不如紐約的高但座座都是龐然巨物，千窗百戶，人像螻蟻般地在進進出出。巴黎市最早發紉於賽因河中一小島，現在規模大了不啻百倍，而以拿破崙的凱旋門儼然成了全市中權，連接的一條香賽里賽大馬路，單請兩旁的人行道，就有上海愛多亞路那麼寬。是的，巴黎市區的清調是完全寬廣而開拓的，路旁樹木扶疏，掩映着挨戶櫛比的龐大房屋，內部却又都金麗輝皇，盡善盡美，可想象巴黎人的生活是在很高的水準上。</p>
<p>地下火車密如蛛綱　用升降機上落</p>
<p>巴黎市政的表現，居室建築之外，主要的當稱交通，這除了法國自造的蘭腦以及飛也脫小型汽車整天如龍如水在飛馳，頂偉大的工程與設計，自以地下車道不能不令人嘆服。因為地面公共汽車被軍事當局徵用，尙未發還，出差汽軍以汽油關係。還不多見，全市主要交通惟以地下車道是賴，萬千人民整天　在地底下，南北奔馳，僅花二法郎，可以遏歷全境，而速度高，使用便，只要方向不差，任何一個陌生人，稍費三分　學習，便能按圖索　，隨心所欲，包不會迷路城找不到家，巴黎的地下火車網非常繁密而復雜，路綫疊牀架　，有的穿河床而過，有的直人深層，須用升降機上下，工程之艱鉅令人咋舌；而管理嚴密，使用人工亦不多，除了因爲人雜空氣稍嫌欠佳，及若干地面或稍欠潔之外，簡直沒有什麼可以批評的地方。</p>
<p>在市區以及市郊，隨處都有古跡名勝，令人徘徊憑弔。有名的凡爾賽宮是附郊歷史勝境，路易十四的遺跡還宛然如黃。那富旁小禮拜堂的占樂，猶至今保存。記得那天我們去遊覽，還特爲奏起樂章，以示歡迎。在另一部分，亦可看到第一次大戰簽訂和約的所在，但事經二十七年，焉知法蘭西竟飽經滄桑，如今憂患餘生，而回首昔日老虎總理墓木已拱，誠不知感慨何似了！</p>
<p>凱旋門和拿破崙墓是法蘭西武功的高潮，凱旋門現亦稱無名英雄墓，以紀念一九一四—一八大戰中犧牲的無名英靈。巍巍巨物，從色調上顯見它的古老，底下一朵火燄，從地裏噴出，永不稍熄，象微民族魂正在不息。這裏終年有着鮮花與花圈不斷地堆在銅碑上，尤其十一月十一日更是萬姓憑弔的地方。拿破崙墓這巨人長眠的處所，另附有拿破崙時代的戰跡博物館，無數萬千的盔甲刀矛，以至戰旗土砲，人像勛章，紛然雜陳在裏面。法國的藝術圖書博物天才確實很高的，我曾去參觀動物國及動和礦物樣本，以及勞甫（Louvre）博物院，其內容之宏當以及造詣之深厚誰都要加　佩。</p>
<p>巷戰彈痕新　當日血跡猶未乾</p>
<p>巴黎人往往又以鐵塔及歌劇院爲其代表作，事實上這兩大建設也確有其應得的估價。鐵塔開始建築雖早，但完成不過在一八八九年，高達九八五公尺，費鐵七千噸，憑電梯或步行上升，全市風景在目，言其工程自然偉大。歌劇院地處鬧市，今仍排演古劇，每夜皆吿客滿，定票極難，但一部分人是去欣賞音樂及其建築的，因爲它是太富麗奢侈無懈可擊了。</p>
<p>在巴黎由於這些美麗境的交織，生活其間確成得有些幸福；但也許太享受而流於逸樂了，以致造成一九四〇年的悲劇。法國人痛定思痛，自宜有所警醒；尤其戰後市容雖無破損，有些地方巷戰彈痕猶存，地下軍在地下車道內奮鬥血跡也米全乾；再反映在今日巴黎人日常生活的貧困，法國的戰後蕭條着實也算深刻了。舉幾個例：法國煤荒未解決，全市的電燈也如重慶一樣實行分區停電，天氣已到應該生火的時候，但是煤呢？看情形只得硬挨過冬了。若干大旅館儘管憑其戰前的設備，十分神氣，茶房一律夜禮服；但因無煤竟很多沒有熱水供應。厠所的草紙，爲了物資缺乏，不少改以舊報紙替代。再說食的問題，精緻的盤碟中，弄來弄去是些洋芋白菜，魚算很好了，鷄肉太少，鷄蛋牛奶不必啓口。惟獨酒類仍很豐富，法國是個吃酒的好地方，沿街喝咖啡吃酒店堂皇矞麗，化幾個法郎太便宜了。</p>
<p>由於物資缺乏，巴黎遭逢着戰後國家同樣的難關。衣食兩項民生問題不易解次，因也施行着定量配給制度，然一般奢侈化妝及婦女用品，仍似到處充塞，只要甘出高價，可以予取予求。巴黎的幾家大百貨公司樣子很新穎，然男子需要者少，多半做的女人生意，事實上巴黎的女人確似比男人多，商店夥計，市政職工，以至馬路上儘是些鶯鶯燕燕，往來不已，商人的眼光究竟敏銳無分中外呢。</p>
<p>巴黎在戰前原也是個歐洲吸引遊客的地方，在今日英美遊客還未上市，却倒是美國孩子正在一批一批地來遼遊。他們從歐洲各地調來休息，美國的紅十字會專設導游機構構招待，——直接助成了巴黎的復員。據說巴黎的女人過剩，這是一個很相當的出路，嫁美國丈夫去新大陸是時髦的。</p>
<p>總結在巴黎所得的印象，其歷史的傳統與光輝，以及法蘭西民族的天才是高超的，但這一個世記來似乎確較鬆散了些。政治上的杌隉不安，竟至最近還未消除，戴高樂旣已擁戴了出來，却因共產黨的强硬要求，險些組不成阻。我們瞭悉戴氏固在力圖上治，但倘無一個安定的政治局面，法國的復興還是缺乏保證的。經齊方面現在的病微是普遍性的，主要猶待聯合國合作帮忙，以及工業復員，才可迅速復蘇，目前的貨幣及物資黑市，猖獗情形確有不妙，然主因還在國家生產力的再造截至執筆時止，法國正在竭力從事產業及銀行國家化計劃，法蘭西銀行收歸國有的時期馬上實現了。但更重要的一個原理，似還在社會重建。上文說過，法人依其祖上餘蔭，不免有流於逸樂，然今欲再造法蘭西第四共和，我們希望法國友人要借加奮發，再埋頭十年！侍候女人的習惱並不壞，沿路開司（Kiss）的風氣亦無傷，徒因這回勝利以後，大家的肩頭更沉重了，我們要怎樣相互勉厲以共維未來世界的永久和平與繁榮？我們都不能忽視一個社會的根本的振作，而更嚴肅，負重地工作起來！</p>

<h3>國際法網下的　四個日本戰犯</h3>
<p>戰時日內閣要員　今日已成階下囚</p>
<p>這兒是面目猙獰的四個日本要犯，已由麥帥列入首批四十名戰犯名單內。目右至左：（上排）東條內閣商相岸信介，文相橋田邦彥，（下排）駐菲大使村田膺哲，法相岩村通世。對於這批戰犯，各方都堅決主張嚴懲，看來是沒有一個能逃出國際法網的了。因爲這是一筆太平洋上和中國戰綫上的空前血債，難道還不應該拿日本戰犯的血來償還我中國和我們的盟邦嗎？</p>
<h3>社論　杜魯門總統重申對華政策</h3>
<p>杜魯門總統在其特使馬歇爾元帥離美來華，三國外長會議在莫斯科召開的時候，發表他對華政策的聲明，重新闡明美國對華國策。杜魯門總統首先說美國政府認爲一强大統一民主之中國，對於聯合國組織及世界和平之成功具有重大關係。爲聯合國及美國的重要利益計，中國人民不可放過以和平商談方式協調國內歧見的機會。美國政府認爲有兩點極關重要：（一）國民政府與共黨軍隊或其它雜色軍隊間的戰鬥必須停止；（二）包容各主要政團代表的全國會議必須召開，以便從早解決國內紛爭，覔竟取中國統一。又說聯合國及美國只承認當今的國民政府爲中華民國惟一合法的政府，只有國民政府才是達成中國統一的正當工具。此外，關於東北，美國駐軍，及其它各點，亦多所闡述。</p>
<p>杜魯門總統這次聲明，足以使從赫爾利大使辭職以後所引起的不甚明朗的局勢，完全澄淸。對於國際及中國局勢之推移上，有很大的裨益。</p>
<p>我們首先要指出的：杜魯門總統的聲明，在大體上，仍舊是美國對華傳統政策的延續。這傳統政策是什麼？就是自十九世紀末葉以來，美國的對華政策在扶持一個强大統一民主中國的建立。自國民政府成立以來，其目的也就在建立起一個强大統一民主的中國。這種建國工作，因日本的侵略而受到阻礙，終於激起我國的八年抗戰。堅苦的抗戰，在國民政府的領導下得到勝利，乃中國建國的必經之階。在敵寇投降後，國民政府負有受降接收的任務，而在執行這種任務上，却遭遇到了共產黨的破壞。共黨軍隊不受中央政府的節制，企圖擴大其佔領區，也就是他們所謂的「解放區」，因而不惜以武力來壓迫在執行受降接收任務的國家軍隊。國民政府始終不曾企圖用武力而希望以政治方式解決共產黨問題，過去幾年如此，現在也如此。所以對杜魯門總統要求立即停止衝突這一種願望，正合全中國人民的要求，也正合國民政府所持的方針，不過共產黨軍隊是否以國家大局爲重，能够立即停止武裝割據，破壞中國的統一，截至今日止，還似乎是一個疑問。</p>
<p>杜魯門總統又指出爲了協助國民政府消滅日本在華的勢力起見，美國目前必須派遣海陸軍駐在中國。這是一個極明智的決定。現在中國戰塲上的日軍雖然已經投降，但有一部份還沒有繳械，且在中國的一百三十萬日軍又待遣送回國。這些都與戰事有關。現在戰鬥行爲雖然終止，戰爭却還不曾完全結束。美軍在華所担任的任務，一方面固在協助國民政府，在另一方面却也在執行他們自身的任務，及聯合國對日作戰的共同任務。共黨軍隊爲了蓄意破壞國民政府受降的工作，竟不惜製造出許多事件，如襲擊美軍，散布要求美軍撒離中國的呼籲，其目的，無非想以武力解決國府受降軍隊，擴大他們的佔領區域，以阻撓中國的統一。中國人民感覺到爲中國利益計，美國利益計，及聯合國利益計，駐華美軍在沒有完遂他們的任務以前，絕對有繼續駐在中國的必要。中美兩國的軍隊在緬甸印度並肩與敵人作戰；也應並肩完成他們未了的任務。</p>
<p>至於說放棄一黨專政實施憲政，這也是國民政府的一貫政策。蔣主席於今春宣稱國民大會將於今年召開，其後以共產黨的反對，始展期至明年五月。政治協商會議之召開，原意即在容納各黨派代表及社會賢達，共商國是，徒因共產黨代表姍姍來遲，以致會議召開一再延期。凡此種種，顯然表明當今中國局勢之所以未得和平解決者，實因共產黨蓄意破壞所致。我們要特別提出的便是：中國共產黨與別國的共產黨不同。別國的共產黨沒有武裝軍隊，沒有自己的政府，而中國的共產黨不特擁有武裝軍隊，抑且擅自組織政府行使政權。這些都爲國法所不容。中國共產黨論法理絕對不能與國民政府站在對等地位，而爲一個商談的對手；但國民政府爲遷就事實，再三與之商談，已足見國民政府的容忍。杜魯門總統說：「像共產黨軍隊那樣獨立自主軍隊的存在，與中國的統一不相容，且使政治上的統一不可能。」這眞是一語破的。在統一民主的實施過程中，中國共產黨必須首先交出它的軍隊。這是杜魯門總統洞悉中國局勢癥結所在的又一明證。</p>
<p>對於美國協助我們工農業的復興，整編及訓練我國的軍隊組織，爲促進中美貿易將對我貸款等等，中國人民在經過長期戰爭的苦難以後，盟邦這一番盛意，自然聞而感奮。中國面臨着善後建國的艱巨工作，極需盟邦的協助。我們希望由於杜魯門總統聲明的發布，能够促使中國共產黨領袖們的覺悟，而在周恩來葉劍英等共黨代表抵渝以後，我們更竭誠盼望他們以大局爲重，誠心誠意參加政治協商會議，使國民政府和平解決一切政治問題的願望得以達到，一個强大統一民主的中國得以建設成功。如此，纔不致孤負盟邦良友對我們的期望。</p>

<h3>大戶逢高出籠　金市欲漲無力　隔日交割制度　昨已開始試做</h3>

<h3>助學金籃球義賽　今晚最後決賽　中靑迎戰奧西納　華聯可望勝海靑　賽畢舉行給獎禮</h3>
<p>本報與同德醫學院聯合主辦之助學金中美籃球義賽，兩日來中美健將各獻其傑出球藝，比賽呈空前精彩，球迷無不滿載而歸。今晚最後二塲，七時半起仍在舊回力球塲球房舉行。當局爲示隆重起見，特請教育局顧局長毓琇行開球典禮，賽後並舉行給獎典禮，請潘主委公展，及同德醫學院顧院長毓琦主持，並將拍賣義球，軍樂隊亦將到塲吹奏，以增興趣。球迷曁獲欣　球藝，又爲助學義舉，常又轟動一時。秩序如次：</p>
<p>美海靑—華聯藥　七時半</p>
<p>奧西納—中靑會　八時半</p>
<p>華聯獲勝　可無問題</p>
<p>今夜第一場為華聯對美海靑，觀華聯與奧西納之戰，華聯僅以三分失敗，難能可貴，華聯不但智勇兼具，且運動道德，亦留人良好印象。美海靑勇則有餘，地板功夫，尙未臻爐火純靑，華聯今日應以智取爲上，震中仍應注重於接濟工作，學崇與成章則須有默契之跑空擋，庶幾能克敵制勝。至利用遠射，華聯切忌少用，蓋阿孔在該塲之藍圈尙未熟悉，則何苦多試，徒喪失獲球權，能如是則華聯勝美海靑五球以上，可無問題。</p>
<p>戰奧西納　當用智取</p>
<p>第二塲中靑會戰奧西納，後者爲美軍聯賽力克華聯之役，其演出確在水準以上，旭蒙之隻手投籃，百步穿楊，殆爲近年來從未得覩之傑作，實爲該隊之靈魂，亦確爲中靑心腹之患。中靑擁有汕隊協興梁溪三者之精銳，陣容不可謂不强，今强敵當前，當求所以攻守，而覓取勝之道，首宜遏制旭蒙之活躍，可用馬燦希或劉福善犧牲死守之，則彼失一主腦後，自可有所機會。至中靑前鋒應重用何金聲陳淸江兩小將，因兩小將地板功夫甚佳，竄射又好，則左右威脅，美單遭逢滑鐵盧，非不可能也。四隊名單如后：</p>
<p>（華聯隊）李震中·孔廣益·吳成章·陳學崇·勃脫·張良雄·張顯崙·徐菊生·陳祚良·金堃·嚴又陵·宋漢章。</p>

<h3>推進美術敎育</h3>
<p>— 濫肇桐</p>
<p>「五四」運動那時，蔡孑民先生創導「美育代宗教」，三十年來，中國的美術教育，却未見多大成效，專門性質的學校，入學的學生不多，設校又未能普遍，講到經費與設備，更使人覺得可憐。中小學裏的美術科，迄今還是「閒科」的地位，遑論它的教材教法了。</p>
<p>我們爲着整個敎育的進展在此不得不提出美術教育的一問題，因為他是整個教育的一環，始終是不能忽略的。</p>
<p>我們要推進美術教育，應該分治本治標的二個方面：</p>
<p>治本的方面，是希望敎育當局從速以其體的力量來復興全國的美術專科學校，加以調整與充實，着重師資的訓練，在師範學院，大學教育系，師範學校中，對於美術教育應即加以重視，訓練優秀的美術師資。並且創立美術館，舉辦美術展覽會，美術獎金等等的其體事業。</p>
<p>治本的方面，也許失之太慢，那應不妨對現有的中小</p>
<p>學美術敎育作一個其體的輔導，做：如何補充現有校的美術設備？如何改善現行美術教材教法？如何促進現任美術教師進修？等的問題，敎育當局應該從速來規劃一下。</p>
<p>最後，我們要希望實行美術科專科視導，可以提高美術教育的地位，也就是推進美術教育的治標的好方法。</p>
<h3>劃時代的藝術學府　市立劇校訪問記</h3>
<p>抗戰勝利以後，上海市的各項建設都在積極的推進，殘破零落的教育事業，也在相繼的恢復和計劃着新的開展。市教育局顧局長因爲感着有關社會教育的戲劇藝術的重要，同時肴到上海戲劇藝術人才的缺乏，應着環境的需要，特予設立了一所市立實騐戲劇學校。並且把日人那裏接收過來的北四川路前日本第一國民學校撥充爲戲劇學校校舍，這是上海戲劇界一個新鮮的消息。</p>
<p>記者爲了要明瞭該校的內部情形，特於日昨的下午，抽暇前往探訪。在陽光和煦西風緊俏的馬路上，抱着一顆興奮而熱烈的心，走到外灘，搭乘一路電車直達到北四川路橫浜橋下車，「上海市立實騐戲劇學校」醒目而嶄新的一塊校牌就映入了我的眼簾。</p>
<p>踏進校門，在一片廣闊的塲地上，有幾個日本僑民在無聊地玩着棒球。走到辦公室裏，就有該校教務主任吳仞之光生殷勤招待。吳先生是對劇藝很有心得而是上海劇壇中有名的專家，這次吳先生能在該校主持教務，將來對該校完多碩劃和供獻。我們相見寒暄了幾句，談話逐漸轉入正題，承吳先生詳細吿訴我該校籌備以來的一切情形，以及今後拓展的計劃。</p>
<p>談校於十月上旬由籌備委員一陳麟端，顧仲彝，李健吾，黃佐臨，張駿祥，魯覺吾，林聖時等幾位先生奉命開始籌備，經過了半個月的積極工作，才吿正式成立。市教育局便委任顧仲　先生爲該校校長。顧先生是著名的編導家，對戲劇研究，積有二十餘年的經騐，他就任校長以後，即於上月十五日起開始招生，廿八廿九兩日舉行入學攷試，錄取新生並已於本月三日揭曉。</p>
<p>在該校校務委員會主任委員張這藩氏領導下的第一次會議中，決定擴大班次，續招新生，現在第二次招攷，又於本月九日宣吿結束了。</p>
<p>他們現在計劃的是先辦「光修班」，訓練期間定二個月，期滿以後，考核成績的優劣，分別列入一年級或二年級。明年度春季始業，準備着先辦話劇科·電影科·樂劇科等。話劇科分演員組和按術組，兩組同時舉辦；電影科先辦演員組；樂劇科先辦　劇組，以後再逐漸擴充。他們的課程，除國英史地等基本學科以外，計有中外文學史，藝術槪論，戲劇槪論，劇塲認識，中外戲劇史，劇本選讀，劇本分析，導演術概論，佈景設計，燈光設計，服裝設計，舞台設計，技術設計，電影認識·舞蹈·歌唱·美工，木工·電工，綫工等四十餘種。</p>
<p>該校自從開始報名以來，有很多職業界的靑年，紛紛前往要求業餘選讀，現在顧校長爲適應社會需要起見，預備兼設選修班，以供職業界有志戲劇靑年研究的機會，現正計劃擬訂章則中。明年起儘可能並且還預備辦一班研究班，入班研究者，須有大學畢業程度，專門研究高深的編導學科，以造就編導人材。</p>
<p>吳仞之先生和我談了約三十分鐘，對該校的情形我已得到了一個淸楚的輪廓，接着吳先生領我開始參觀校舍，房屋相富寬暢，除普通學科教室以外，正在計劃着各科特殊教室的設備，木工室啊，表演室啊，舞蹈室啊，這裏有着與普通學校絕對不同的設備，將來能够逐項實施，確是一個劃時代的藝術學府。</p>
<p>現在這校舍中，還住着三百餘名日僑，準備待命返國，該校一切詳密計劃的展開，當待這一批日僑離去以後實行。撓校一周，辭別歸來，濡筆記此，對該校備途實寄着無限的展望。（鳶）</p>

<h3>合衆社記者述　上海日僑動向</h3>
<p>一部分竟反抗民主</p>
<p>據合衆社本市訊：上海日本人之再敎育運動，爲期已近兩月，目下已遭嚴重之秘密反抗。中國當局之寬大態度，初曾使日人感激不盡，但現已逐漸淡漠。據稱少數頗具勢力之日人，正作種種秘密活動，以反抗中國當局將民主思　注入集中於滬北九萬日人之腦中。另一小部份日人，則公開提倡廢棄天皇制度，熟烈贊成麥帥管制日本之計劃，然此種日人，爲數過少。不足以影響日　社會，因多數在心理上均有接受軍人派思想之傾向。據消息靈通方面稱：日人之進行秘密反抗者，可分四派，彼等均欲在日僑社會中爭取領導，各不相讓。據稱：日人中之極端國家主義派已成立一突擊隊，其中且有前日本憲兵隊中人多名在內。</p>

<p>又華界及法租界交界處鐵門，亦將於最近期內拆除。</p>
<h3>善後救濟上海分署　積極分配救濟品　慈善市場廿日起公賣五天</h3>
<p>自美駛華之救濟船隻，到滬者業有十艘，預計於一二日內，將又有二艘可駛抵此間，上項船隻所載來之救濟物品，由行政院善後救濟總署上海辦事處接收後，業已支配交由上海分署散發者，計有麵粉六萬噸，軍用口糧二百四十六噸，舊衣三千包，藥品計有盤尼西林二百瓶DDT殺虫劑等。</p>
<p>中外難民分別救濟</p>
<p>據上海分署負責人稱：上海現須待救濟者，除本國難民外，並有猶太難民一萬五千人，白俄二千人，暨留滬之義大利水兵約四五百人；此外尙有中歐各國難民若干人。該處所散發之救濟品，關於中國難民方面，交由各慈善團體及難民收容所發放，猶太難民方面，交由猶太人在滬所自行糾織之聯合救濟協會支配，白俄方面，交由白俄協會分散，義大利水兵及中歐各國難民，則彼等亦各組有專門團體，負責向救濟分署申請具領救濟物品後，分別散發。現分署已發出之第一批麵粉，數額極鉅，第二批麵粉，亦已決定於短時期內發出，軍川口糧則已有八千箱，於前昨數日內發交各慈善團體及猶太協會。</p>
<p>捐贈舊衣品類不一</p>
<p>至自美運來之救濟葡衣三千包，則甫於上星期六啓運上岸，其中有極良好之西裝，大衣，亦有極破舊之襯衫，衣裙，並有襪子，皮鞋，甚至洋傘等各種零星用具，每一舊衣包內，所有之衣物，品類不一。蓋此皆爲美國各地人士自動將所有舊衣捐贈中國地區內難民者，故其所捐贈之衣服，頗不一致。上海分署以天時轉寒，對上項舊衣已決定於日內即行散發與難胞及各國難民禦寒，聞並將略加整理，俾於支配時，以適合各難民之需要。</p>
<p>盤尼西林愼重領用</p>
<p>關於藥品方面，上海分署已領到之盤尼西林二百瓶（每瓶十萬個單位），業已交由仁濟，宏仁，廣慈，紅十第一，市立第二，西門婦孺，上海兒童，公濟等九醫院，指定醫生負責簽領。凡病人必須用盤尼西林救治，並已施用消治龍一類藥劑無效者，始得注射該項盤尼西林，並規定如經調查確係赤貧者始予免費，吾則視病人之經濟力量，分爲三等價格取費。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕救濟船裝載來滬之物資，點收時常有短少，原因係美廠不及交貨，而救濟船開駛，又不能延期，以致與原貨單不符。聞此項短少物資即將補運來滬。</p>

<h3>鈕宣慰特使廣播　大上海的新作風　以精勤篤實四字爲中</h3>
<p>中央廣播事業管理處上海廣播電台，昨日（十七日）晚七時四十五分，特請中央特派蘇浙皖三省京滬兩市宣慰特使鈕永建先生，至該台演講。請題爲「大上海的新作風」，演講全文如下：</p>
<p>各位聽衆，今天承上海廣播電台的邀請，得與大家講話，覺得非常榮幸，不過我所要講的話，前天已由葉楚傖先生全都講了，再沒有新的意思可以補充。現在拿一些普通尋常的話，所謂老生常談，來應命，眞是慚愧。</p>
<p>此次我們來上海，承蔣主席的指示，是要我們多總人民的話，動求</p>
<p>民間疾苦</p>
<p>宣達中央德意，希望人民對中央行政的苦心，有深刻的了解，而把民間疾苦的情形，帶回中央，呈請採擇，以則行政上有所改善，而使中央與地方堅强團結，同向建國的大道上，努力奮發前進，以達到建設富强康樂新中國的目的。</p>
<p>記得前天　楚傖先生說，上海是中國與世界交通的出紙口，他的政治，經濟，文化，敎育，社會等一切事情，不但影響中國甚大，並且還要影響到全世界。所以上海必須要成爲一個首善之區，務必要</p>
<p>人人努力</p>
<p>方不負我們做一個上海人的責任。這話實使我們非常的感動，我是一個上海人，所以我願追隨上海的大衆，來共同努力，以負起我人應有的責任。</p>
<p>現在的上海，因承中央及市政當局與社會人士的共同努力，雖然於恢復後才不過三個多月，可是已有相當的進步，這是使我們佩服的。然而痛定思痛，因受戰事的損失，敵僞的　括，仍是</p>
<p>瘡痍滿目</p>
<p>當前的問題重重，諸如物價的高漲，人民生活的困難，工廠的毀壞，或被接收而尚未復工，致工人的失業，物資的缺乏，教育經濟與工商事業等等之須待緊理。又或以少數人員之行爲失檢，或緊　未周，或辦理失當，貽人口實，亦所難免，此在八年來敵僞重重破壞以後所不能免之事實，市當局正在體察民情，以事整頓。我們經數日來之調查與觀察，亦已略知其梗槪，現在力來建設民主化的新中國，是極願意大家來</p>
<p>直言無諱</p>
<p>只要是善意的，建設性的。我們此次的來，就是代表蔣主席勤求民隱，大家能說老賞話？這是建設大上海的唯一要義，中國種種公私事業過去的弊病，就是忌　與粉飾，因此就有許多人不講實話，不求實效，因爲不　實　不求實效，影響所及，竟至關於民族國家許多重要的事，亦就有許多只講表面，而永無事實上的進步。所以弄得事事不及人家，這是最最壞的事情，我們必須要加以改正。大家來</p>
<p>說老實話</p>
<p>以樹立新作風。說老實話，是我們樹立新作風的開端，其他一切的美德善行，均以此出發。因爲能說老實話，就可求精求勤，求篤實踐履之功，於是再進一步，我們就要以精勤篤賞四字貢　於大家。這是蔣主席歷來所昭示的實訓，我們必要澈底的奉行的。業精於勤，所以動實是精的根本工作，能勤然後才能精，能動於生產工作的人，就能</p>
<p>增加生產</p>
<p>充裕物資。小之可以富足個人的享用，大之可以供給社會國家的需求，從根本上平抑物價，安定民生，在這個環境裏。自然不會有貪汚不法的行爲，這勤字直接間接的效果，賞在是不可限量。若能把勤字用之於學問，那就孜孜不倦，專精研習，精益求精，原子彈就是由精勤而造成的，還怕什麼事不能做嗎。所以有了</p>
<p>精勤篤實</p>
<p>四字，那是無價之寳，取之不窮，用之不竭的。建設大上海這是我們當前的偉大事業，當此人力物力缺乏之際，當然困難重重，可是精勤篤實的新作風，那就等於一顆萬應靈丹。因此我們工作的進行，事業的成就，可就易如反掌，永建因獻身抗戰與上海睽違八年，今番來滬，拜見鄉友，無以爲贈，謹以此精勤篤實四字爲禮物，貢獻於久別重逢的父老兄弟姊妹之前，兼表願共勉力之忱，而助大上海建設之完成。</p>
<h3>天氣變了　介紹徐家匯天文台</h3>
<p>天氣變了！前夜還是大家覺着溫暖，不想一夜細雨，到昨天早晨竟就暴冷起來。整天朔風怒號，滿天彤震，站在愛多亞路中滙大樓前面，等乘二十二路紅色汽車的人們，如果不雙腿用勁，簡直就會給大風吹倒。在一天之中，記者親見有五個行人，在大風裏追趕自己的帽子。停在馬路邊的脚路車都給風吹倒了，在霞飛路福開森路一帶，更吹坍了好幾處竹　。徐家滙的小河浜也冰凍了一半，上海爲路上的行人，沒有一個不冷得雙脚亂跳！</p>
<p>前天的氣溫還是五十幾度（華氏），昨天一冷就冷到了冰　以下。</p>
<p>就在這樣氣候突變的時候，記者冒着利剪似的竅風，趕到你家滙，去訪問了全國聞名的大文　。</p>
<p>七十多年的歷史</p>
<p>關心中國科學史的人，應當都記得在十六七世紀，有利瑪竇和湯若望兩人從歐洲趕到中國朝廷來做「欽天監」的大科學家。這兩位的大名是應當在中國歷史上永遠不朽的，但是他們還不過開了風氣之先；等到一八七三年，天主敎的耶穌會敎徒們，才正式在中國打下了正式科學研究的基礎——他們開辦大學，中學，孤兒院，工藝院，都在徐家滙附近，而在科學上最有價値的，就是徐家匯天文臺了。</p>
<p>天文臺位於有名的天主堂對門，在抗戰期間，日本人因爲這是屬於敎會的「私產」，所以並沒有干涉，總算沒有受到騷擾。勝利之後，聽說曾經有軍隊想去佔據，不過經過說明之後，也就退出了。至今在大門口的木板上，還寫着「私人產業，謝絕參觀」八個字。</p>
<p>大門裏面是一個花園，美麗的月季花在風中亂舞。花園的中部是十幾級台階，上面就是天文台的辦公處了。走進了重重的銅門，祗覺得一陣寂靜，　　外面寒風狂吼，裏面却靜得祇聽見鐘擺「的滴」的聲音。</p>
<p>會見龍相齊神父</p>
<p>天文臺的客廳陳設得非常雅緻，紅木的坑床上面舖着華貴的軟墊，廳的中央散置着幾只太師椅子。在這裏，記者會到了犬文台的負責人，龍相齋神父。（Fr.　Ernest　Cherzi）龍神父是意國人，然而他還有一個中國的號，呌「貴卿」。他的頭銜是：「徐家匯天文台氣象學地震學無錢電主任，國際氣象學會會員，敎庭科學會曾員，國際無綫電研究會會員。」到中國來了已經有二十六年。龍神父和翁副院長（詠　）及丁文江先生都是老友，現在這天文台是由政府最高當局和翁副院長，委託辦理全國測候和其他有關犬文的工作。外灘的測候所（semaphore）每天發表的氣象報告，實在爲都是由徐家匯天文台供給材斜的。</p>
<p>照徐家匯天文台工作的重要性，和龍神父在國際科學界的地位而論，一般人都一定以爲他下面一定有許多的助手。但是在事實上，他的助手祇有—一個！每天上午五點半，他自已便起來收聽各地無綫電報告氣候，這種收音工作是極度困難的。聲音的强弱不定，雜聲非常之多，隔音也很不淸楚。最初也曾請助手帮助，然而他們事賞上無法聽淸，反而使事情更糟，於是他爽性自己動手了。記者問他：「這不是太累了嗎？」然面瘦長矯健的龍神父，却衹是輕輕撫了一下他的灰黑的　　，他說；「這正是一種愉快。」</p>
<p>艱苦工作的成績</p>
<p>走進天文台的圖書室，祇覺得自己忽然變得渺小了。滿牆都是書架，一直堆到天花板。龍神父拿出了一本長四尺闊三尺的厚厚一本「東亞氣象地圖」。這是他最近工作的成績，費了兩年多工夫，在一九四四年出版的。內容包括幾百種不同的地圖和表格，而在遠東實在還是一種空前的嘗試。對於農業，交通，水利，航空，水電工程，衛生，化學工程—這本地圖的價値是無可比擬的。　最近，他經五年研究，發明了一種新的氣溫表格，可以用很簡單的方法，在一二月前預測某一天大概的氣候。這一次暴冷，他在二個月以前就知道了。他預言聖誕節後一兩天，這要要有一次暴冷。他已經把這個發現作成論文，預備寄到美國去發表。</p>
<p>在這次大戰中，應用很廣的　運，徐家匯天文台在太平洋戰事發生前四年，便已應用了牠的原理，作氣象研究了。最近盟軍中去參觀的人，有不少表示了極大的驚訝！</p>
<p>徐家匯天文台自創立至今，已經造成了五十多個氣象人才，現在分散在靑島·北平·等處。目前航空事業發達，中國正是需要大批天文和氣象人員的時候，有多少靑年是願意學着這位勞苦功高的神父的樣子，默默地工作，爲國宣勞呢？對於這位清苦工作近三十年的學者，記者眞不禁生出了無上的敬意。（平齋）</p>
<p>七十年來的徐家匯天文台，在科學上做着繼續不斷的實際工作。在龍神父領導之下，每天和全世界各地天文台互相通訊，報告消息。尤其是氣象報告，貢獻於航海方面最多。這是徐家匯天文台的外貌。</p>
<h3>寒浪襲滬　氣溫驟降</h3>
<p>本市昨日拂曉，朔風怒號，氣候驟轉凛冽，溝渠間開始凝結薄氷，而終日風勢狂烈，窗戶玻璃遭震墮者甚多。是項寒流，今日恐尚須盤桓，酷寒氣候，其勢仍將繼續。</p>
<p>强力之西比利亞反旋風氣團，集中蒙古上空，已侵入華北及本市。</p>
<p>氣候預測；黃海上空，晴寒，有霧氣，轉極寒，西北颶風轉北，至明晚可趨弱。本市上空：多雲，有霧氣，較寒，强力西北風轉北，漸趨弱。東海上空；多雲轉陰暗，降雨，西北颶風轉東北。東海上空：台灣海峽周圍極强之東北風。</p>

<p>特寫</p>
<h3>歌聲中的美軍</h3>
<p>— 張德乾</p>
<p>上海的繁華區，充滿着熙來　往的美國勇士，他們穿着不同的制服，來自不同的地域，有的是跋涉萊多公路的巡禮者，有的是飛越喜馬拉雅的探險家，有的是航遍太平洋的哥倫布。他們剛把野人山崖的土，嘉陵江上的霧，和冲繩島隅的風，丟在後面，猛然一個筋斗，跌人這東方大都市的十丈紅塵裏。</p>
<p>上海，這東西文化交流點的都市，對於來自中國內地的美軍，覺得非常親切，好像已經回到了祖國一般，至少可以治愈他們一半的懷鄉病，而對於來自海外的，却又覺得十分新奇，瑰麗—只有一件事使那班驀生的客人們感覺遺憾，就是在搜遍了這人口過剩的市　後，竟沒有找到在他們理想中作爲中國文化之象微的辮子和小脚。</p>
<p>曾在戰前到渦中國的，不論祗躭過三天兩天也好，立刻就被封爲中國通，而他們也就老實不客氣地以識途老馬自居，帶領着一華小兄弟們往中國舖子獵奇去。於是，壽衣店裏的積年存貨，就被搶購一空，而久被冷落在一隅的過了時的水烟筒，也立刻身價十倍，一躍而爲洋人們的珍品。本來末，要不帶些　如此類的壽頭壽腦的東西回家去，他們將用什麼來炫示敎區裏的牧師，和久別的愛人，使他們相信自已所述的海外奇譚呢？</p>
<p>湯米明天要回國了，在愉快的情緒中，不免滲入些惆悵—他有些捨不下那迷人的白俄葆琳娜。在洋溢着美國氣氛的酒排中，他和她對飲着最後的一杯酒。葆琳娜含情脈脈地掏出一張CRB來，簽了個字，遞給湯米，說，『請你不要忘記這從中國帶回去的一點小小的紀念品，』瞧，這是張一萬元的大票呢！湯米靦覥地摸出一張二十元（多慚愧呀）的美金票來，也簽了個字，遞給她道，『請你也保存牠罷。』但願她能够保存牠！</p>
<p>喬是個　　家，他已經學習得把筷子玩得和中國人一樣好，並且能够區別廣東菜和四川菜的特點。他知道，即使是在舊金山，紐俄連斯，甚至紐的，也不見得會吃得像在上海那樣對胃口的，在這離滬的前夕，他是要痛痛快快地吃一頓的了。</p>
<p>倒霉的是鮑勃，他不但不能帶一些東方色彩的紀念品回家去，反而連他從家鄉帶出來的派克筆和漢密爾登錶也都落到無國籍的掘金女郞手中去了。躑躅在冷靜的夜的南京路上，擲完了最後一只甩砲，緬想起雷伊泰灣海戰時的雄風，初到上海時的豪氣，反映到此時此際的　索落寞，不禁棖觸萬端。摸摸身邊，尚剩一張五千元的CRB，拿來換取一張中文的夜報（不錯，這也是一件極有價值的紀念品呀）；他便欣然地踏着大步（他沒有錢乘他所喜歡的三輪車了），向外　走去。</p>
<p>美軍紛紛地來，又匆匆地走了。他們各人懷着不同的悲歡離合的情緒，悄然地離開這幻奇雜沓的東方都市，回到祖國的懷抱中去。讓我們祝福這班天眞的大孩子們永遠保持着他們的朝氣，祝他們一路順風！</p>
<p>一九四三年秋，彭德在美曾受到缺席檢舉。本年五月間，他在北部義大利被民軍捕獲。同年十一月十八日始由義大利押解回國；，他在義大利還留下一個姘婦，兩個兒子，一個八十六歲的老母。這是美國第一次經由無綫電波洩的叛國案件。在送入美京監獄的時候，他還在說：『在一個無綫電的時代，若使沒有無錢電上的言飾自由，…那我將爲一個觀念而死…』。</p>
<p>國際</p>
<h3>永被歧視的黑人</h3>
<p>— 沈吟</p>
<p>在民主國的美國，黑人一向受着歧視，這次大戰中他們遠征到英國各地，雖建了不少殊功，但歧視仍不能免，種族的觀念確是很難消除的。</p>
<p>黑人軍隊一到威爾斯，卡留夫城的市長就和美軍長官商量：年輕的女孩子若混到黑人軍隊裏去，該用甚麼方法去『防範』？當局並不怪黑人，他們恨女孩子不應同黑人在一起，而黑人見當局單單不讓女孩子同他們在一齊，自然起了一種被歧視的感受。</p>
<p>英國人對黑人的態度也各處不同。普通在小的城鎭裏，沒有美國軍士駐紥的地方，居民總比較親熱得多。他們對黑人軍隊和對其他軍隊一樣，起先很冷淡，逐漸就熟起來。有時請黑人去他們家中玩，女孩子也同他們一塊兒看電影，跳舞，玩笑。結婚的很少，據美軍當局知道，祗有一起，但混血兒的私生子却有不少起發現。</p>
<p>有些地方，居民同黑人感情很融治，是因爲紅十字會促進的力量。黑人軍隊一到某地，紅十字會就請當地居民合作，招待黑人。住家的主婦常請黑人去吃飯，紅十字會的俱樂部並設有跳舞會，美軍黑人一律招待，但跳的多半是黑人。</p>
<p>在劍橋地方，黑人同美國兵都有，當地居民的態度，在黑人看起來就有些兩樣。黑人常吵，他們帶着白種女孩子走過街上時，常有警士攔住，勸她們回　去。經紅十字會工作人員干涉後，這類事已不再發生，但是婦女同黑人在一齊，往往被人家疑作娼妓，因爲避免誤會，保全名譽，良家婦女此後也就不大敢同黑人兵士接近了。</p>
<p>在第八空軍聚集的伊樸斯維地方，跳舞廳常隔日輪流接待白種人同黑人。黑人說這一來更增加了歧視。因爲黑人跳舞時，有幾個白種兵士在旁邊看守着，原來他們要認淸楚誰和黑人跳，下次他們好別去理那些女孩子。白種人還一口咬定，說同黑人一齊的女孩可分兩類，一種是有喜愛黑人癖的，一種就是『半職業性的』娼妓。</p>
<p>據駐紮在倫敦的黑人兵士說當地人對黑人的歧視極深刻。酒店中遇到黑人，每每將價錢要得高些，飯館有空座，看到黑人時，回說客滿；有些公共的地方，時候稍遲，就關門拒客，有的旅館，黑人去過一次，就留下記號，下次再用那姓名在電話中定房間，再休想定到。</p>
<p>有些黑人人說：他們在英國受的歧視，並沒有在美國受的那樣深刻。在美國他們常有一種自卑心理，在英國却受得待遇平等，將來回美國後，也許會失望，但不會再感到卑底了。但是還有些黑人却說，英國人對他們的歧視祗有逐日加甚，主要是美國軍兵的薰染，有些歧視在美國南部還可以避免，但在英國，簡直使你受不了。</p>

<h3>滄桑</h3>
<p>— 柯定𥂜</p>
<p>最近，翻翻我的舊衣箱，在箱底翻出了幾張珍臟着好久的五元十元的法幣。因爲當時是檢了新的收藏，所以依然是紙張挺括，圖案富麗，印刷鮮明。</p>
<p>這些十元法幣，在八年之前，一張可以買到頭號白米一石。而八年後勝利了三個月的今天，一張十元法幣，祇能買到一片薄薄的大餅。八年前，一石頭號白米，五口之家，足可吃上一個多月；而現在的一片薄薄的大餅，不知能放在饑餓肚子的那一隻角落！</p>
<p>所以我對於這珍藏了好久的少許的五元十元不同樣的法幣，祗有欣賞的意念，而沒有動用的勇氣。好得有一架大鏡框在着，就把它放在黑卡紙上，裝在大鏡框裏，題了：「滄桑」二字，作爲我滬寓的點綴品。</p>
<p>書評</p>
<h3>生命是我們的</h3>
<p>— 余新恩</p>
<p>劉任　先生寫的「生命是我們的」三幕悲劇，深刻地描寫着這次抗戰中不知幾許爲正義而犧牲的愛國之士，在敵人和漢奸的雙層鐵蹄下，勇敢直前，熱情堅毅，各在這動盪的大時代中，完成了他們那不可抹殺的偉大使命。不過，這些志士，沒有獲得勳章，沒有得到高位爵祿，但是却從他們這千千萬萬無名英雄的生命中，換來了今日的自由與和平。</p>
<p>江大夫，和他的獨生子的翰，孟德爾遜院長，林茵，老劉，全都是淪陷區的好人，如作者所說：「在這個世界上，是不能容載好人的。」作者以職務的關係，加以文藝的天才，將江大夫和這些劇中人描寫盡緻；他們的愛國，他們的犧牲，在那極度危險艱苦的塲合下，實則其功績不下於得勳章獲高位的一羣，祗是在今日這個世界，他們是被忽略了的。</p>
<p>第一幕講江大夫以醫人的天責，在矛盾的心理下，將殺人不見血的大漢奸趙會長給救治好了。第二幕中，江大夫和他的獨生子的翰爲了愛國，反給趙會長捕獲受到酷刑與莫大的悔辱。第三幕終於好人犧牲於惡人的手中。一幕一幕的情緒加緊，顯着善惡生死的對照，殺人救人的矛盾，可歌可泣，可悲可歎，這是一個合乎時代的劇作，値得我們注意的。</p>

<p>— 賽珍珠著　朱綺譯</p>
<p>但是貞雄那晚在搜索着那在黃昏時海中的一點黑點時，獲得了他的酬報。在暮藹中沒有了那一閃的亮光。那島上已沒有人了。他的俘虜已經走了——無疑地是平安的。因爲他曾警告過他，要他祗可以等待一隻高麗漁船。</p>
<p>他在洋臺上站了一會兒，望着那海，那天晚上，這年輕人就是從那裏來的。他的腦子裏，雖然沒有什麼原因，浮現了幾個熟識的白種人的臉——那敎授，他就是在他家裏遇見花子的，一個呆滯的人，他的妻子雖然一心想待人好，却是個愚蠢嘮叨的婦人。他記起了他的老解剖學敎師，他堅持着用刀時必須有測隱之心，後來他想起了他的又胖又衣衫不整的房東太太的臉。他因爲是個日本人，在美國找個住處很是困難。美國人是很多成見的，一方面知道自己比他們優越，一方面却要住在他們中間，那是很痛苦的。那個最後允許讓他住在她那可憐的家的旣沒知識又　的老婦人，他那時是多麼的看不起她呀！他有一次曾想試試對她存着感激之心，因爲在他讀書的最後一年，他曾在他患流行性感冒時服侍過他，可是這是很困難的，因爲地雖然和氣，在他看來還是可憎的。不過白種人的確是可憎的。如今到底和他們開了戰，眞呌人痛快。現在他記起了他的俘虜的年輕憔悴的臉——蒼白而可憎。</p>
<p>他想：「奇怪，我眞奇怪爲什麼我不能殺掉他？」</p>

<h3>頭號文化「美奸」</h3>
<p>— 凌岱</p>
<p>在知堂老人以漢奸在北平被捕的時候，從美國也傳來頭號文化『美奸』的被捕，押解到美京華盛頓的監獄裏的消息；這就是從前以詩人馳譽美國文壇的彭德（Ezra　Pound）。彭德是一向奇居在歐洲的名詩人，他的詩曾披露在美國第一流的文學刋物裏，是美國超現實主義運動的健將，並在詩歌方面，提出了革命『形象運動』（Lmagis　Movemeot）。自一九二〇—三〇年代以來，他的地位多少足與愛利亞脫（T.　S.　Eliot）相頡頏，爲一般靑年詩人的偶像。</p>
<p>彭德原本生在美國西檢阿特河州的鑛區，是一個探鑛家的兒子。他感覺到美國的環境太不適合於文　的創作，而且不能賞職他的長才，故在美國中部的一個大學裏過了一個短時期的敎授生活之後，便於一九〇八年離美，在倫敦住了一個時候，又住在巴黎，最後遷到了義大利北部的『碧海之角』，在尉藍的南欣晴空下，悠靜而饒有古意的地中海濱，度着他的寓公生涯。這其間，除了他的詩篇在美國雜誌上發表出版外，很少有機會回到美國去。一九三六年，他發現了墨索里尼的『偉大』；同年他還寫了詩篇歌詠捧喝黨的領袖爲美國民主傳統的繼承人。一九三九年回到了美國，公然宣稱法西斯的義大利『比西方任何一處都要自由』。</p>
<p>歐戰起後，他不能從英美得到版稅，於是他就出現在『軸心』的無綫電波浪上；珍珠港事變以後，他從無綫電上向美國人民說：『因總統的神經欠正常而產生的參戰罪行是不合法的』。他又向美國人民說：『無論你如何想是在羅斯福或邱吉爾的領導下，實際上希特勒及墨索里尼却是你們的領袖』。又說：『你們作戰的長短決定於希特勒的高興，決定於日本的高興』。</p>
<p>社會服務　防癆講座</p>
<h3>肺病無憂論（一）</h3>
<p>中國保健協會</p>
<p>編看按：近年肺病患者，日見增多，靑年男女，亦易傳染，纏綿牀褥，經年累月，痛苦殊深，此與民族健康關係極大，本欄有鑑於斯，特的中國保健協會專門醫師撰述防癆講座一篇，約三千字，分四次刋完，希病家注意。</p>
<p>（一）因循苟安爲肺病自殺政策</p>
<p>在都市的人們，不知不覺中，受到肺病侵襲的人，往往自以爲肺部很健康，並不想到怎樣去斷定肺部的是否確賞健康，而一任病機的潛滋暗長，又因初起症狀極微，往往不能自覺，而亳不理會，直到病勢進行已深，方才發急，手忙脚亂，怨天允人，而不知錯過早期的適當治療時機，實由於自身的因循苟安，這樣的在不知不覺中趨向自殺政策，又那得不招致悲慘的結果呢？</p>
<p>（二）肺癆無特效藥</p>
<p>世上如有像六〇六治梅毒，金鷄納霜治瘧疾，那樣有特效的肺病特效藥，那麼癆病的减少，就有顯著的事實表現出來，而我們也提倡之不邋，決無反對用藥物來治療肺病的理由了。但是國人却給貪圖省事和苟安目前的兩種心理支配着，偏多迷信調理和服藥，其實除對症功用如止咳退熟等外，對於肺癆病原菌，可說任何藥物一律不發生什麼效力，尤其是一般藉廣告宣傳的藥品，貽誤病家最甚，雖然此類藥品並不直接有害於人體，可是吸引病家長期服用，却把正當的治療時機輕易錯過，以至不可挽救，耗費了無數金錢，仍把生命犧牲，蚩不寃哉枉也！</p>
<p>（三）肺病咯血乃可喜之事</p>
<p>肺病而至咯血，在一般患者的心理上，必然引起幾分憂懼，其實一個肺病患署，如發生咯血現象，正是件可喜的事。因爲這樣可以毫不遲疑地抓住一個就醫治療的機會，在醫藥發達的今日，止血固非難事，但止血後，千萬勿忘根本治療的重要，藉　肺病全治的目的。</p>

<h3>Chairman's Visit to North China Inspires, Military and Political Circles Actively Exert Themselves</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Peiping, 17th] The Chairman's arrival in Peiping has deeply inspired the people of North China, leading to positive responses in both military and political spheres. During a lecture convened on the 14th at Huai Ren Hall with heads of various departments, the Chairman not only provided instructions regarding personnel and procedures for the takeover, but also expressed his strong disapproval of the city's appearance, stating that of his six visits to Peiping, his impression of the city's appearance was the worst this time. While this was undoubtedly due to damage caused during the Japanese occupation, a major reason was the failure of those who took over to implement the principles of the New Life Movement, focusing on tidiness and cleanliness, and to clean and reorganize accordingly. In his lecture, the Chairman instructed the vigorous implementation of the New Life Movement, starting with civil servants setting an example for the people. The Chairman's lecture has had a rapid impact in this regard. The Garrison Headquarters decided at the eighth public safety meeting the following day: (1) Military, political, party, and group organizations will jointly conduct regular cleaning campaigns, with each department responsible for supervising street cleaning for one day. (2) Bicycles, rickshaws, and pedicabs should be parked neatly and, when moving, should be lined up as much as possible to avoid congestion. (3) Sandbags inside the city gates should be tidied up by the troops, and unnecessary ones should be removed. (4) The closing time of the city gates will be extended. In the economic sphere, the Chairman was deeply saddened by the failure of the takeover personnel to coordinate and effectively utilize the economic institutions and production enterprises of the enemy and puppet regimes after the takeover, considering it the greatest shame after victory. In his lecture, he instructed the responsible personnel of each department to cooperate fully, quickly utilize resources, continue production, and correct the phenomenon of "takeover equals stagnation." After respectfully listening to the instructions, the relevant authorities immediately began actively planning for the resumption of various state-owned, publicly-owned, and privately-owned production enterprises. Furthermore, regarding the electricity supply in Peiping, due to the insufficient capacity of the Shihchingshan Power Plant, high-voltage lines from the Tangshan Power Plant were used for transmission. In recent months, due to a shortage of bituminous coal in Peiping, the high-voltage power lines from Tangshan were frequently damaged by bandits, leaving more than half of Peiping in darkness every night, causing great inconvenience to the citizens and particular hardship for the news media working at night. Since the Chairman's arrival in Peiping, although there are still areas with insufficient power at night, the entire city is lit, and there have been no power outages. According to sources from the relevant authorities, the power generation capacity of the Shihchingshan Power Plant has increased, and the high-voltage lines from Tangshan have fortunately been repaired. The citizens deeply feel that they owe this light to the Chairman. The students of Peiping hold the Chairman in high esteem, like children far from home longing for their kind father. Their enthusiastic emotions were fully expressed during the gathering and lecture in front of the Taihe Hall on the 16th. It is generally believed that the Chairman and his children have formed a long wall of love, which is no exaggeration. Today, street gossip revolves around how the Chairman lovingly comforted and embraced the surrounding students yesterday, and how the students tugged at his clothes and sleeves, vying to catch a glimpse of the Chairman's demeanor. This intense enthusiasm is believed to be unprecedented in any meeting between a head of state and young people, and cannot be described with words like "grand spectacle" or "unprecedented occasion."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Peiping, 17th] People here have expressed surprise and admiration at Chairman Chiang and his wife's approachable behavior. People from all walks of life, both Chinese and foreign, including the press, are discussing this. The day after Chairman and Madame Chiang arrived in Peiping, they dined incognito at a Chinese restaurant, accompanied by only two officials. Although they were soon recognized by the waiters, they continued their meal. Afterward, they chatted briefly with the manager.</p>
<h3>North China People's Petitions to be Handled Within Two Weeks</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Peiping, 17th] The Chiang Chairman's office announced that it would accept petitions from the people of North China regarding grievances. After the deadline on the 15th, all letters submitted by the people have been collected and sorted by the office. However, letters sent from distant places have continued to arrive late. It is reported that Chairman Chiang attaches great importance to this matter and specifically instructed the personnel in charge on the 17th that this matter must be handled quickly, accurately, carefully, and thoroughly. They must complete the sorting of all petitions as soon as possible, handle them according to their contents, and even if the full results cannot be obtained immediately, they must provide a proper response to each letter within two weeks to address the grievances.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 16th] People here wept bitterly this afternoon while listening to the live broadcast of Chairman Chiang's lecture to students at the Taihe Hall in Peiping. Although the Chairman's words were not directed at them and did not mention the Northeast, the people of the Northeast, who had not heard the Chairman's voice and seen his face for fourteen years, were deeply moved by his solemn sincerity and passionate voice. The cheers from the broadcast also resonated with them.</p>
<h3>Madame Chiang in Peiping Watches the Latest American Dance</h3>
<p>[United News Agency, Peiping, 16th] Madame Chiang Sung Mei-ling suddenly visited the American Red Cross Club this afternoon. A dance tune was playing on the phonograph at the time. Someone told Madame Chiang, "This is a very good American Jitterbug." Madame Chiang immediately replied, "I haven't seen that yet." Sergeant Giles, 21 years old, volunteered to perform in front of the distinguished guest, but finding a dance partner proved difficult. Eventually, Miss Han Minwei, 27 years old, who had served in Burma, was found and willing to give it a try. Madame Chiang's wish was fulfilled, and she was able to watch the latest American Jitterbug dance.</p>
<h3>Central Training Corps to Move to Nanking, Planned Reorganization Under the Examination Yuan, Demobilized Officers to be Transferred for Training in Batches</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Chungking, 16th] The Central Training Corps is currently planned to be incorporated into the regular administrative system, reorganized under the Examination Yuan, and placed alongside the Examination Committee and the Ministry of Personnel. Since its establishment, over 20,000 people have received training at the corps. It is now in the process of moving to Nanking along with the government. The new location has been selected at the former site of the Training Headquarters outside the Zhongshan Gate in Nanking's Xiaolingwei, which is very extensive. Its organization may be more than three times its current size. More than 300,000 demobilized officers from the military will be transferred to the corps for short-term training in batches, and then assigned to substantive positions based on their skills, interests, and needs to strengthen the military's cadre in various departments.</p>
<h3>Amphibious Glider Successfully Test Flown in China</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chungking, 17th] Chen Chih-hsuan, an instructor at the China Gliding Association, recently modified an intermediate glider into an amphibious glider. At 3:00 p.m. on the 17th, it successfully completed its test flight over Fuhsingkuan and safely landed on the surface of the Coral Dam River. This is the first amphibious glider in China.</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang's Address to Rescued Comrades from the Stationed American Troops in Peiping</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Peiping, 16th] After inspecting the U.S. Marine Corps in Peiping on the 16th, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek went to the U.S. military radio station to deliver an address to the American officers and soldiers, which was broadcast by the station to various parts of North China and the United States. The full text of the address is recorded below: "General Rockey, General Jones, officers and soldiers of the 5th and 11th Regiments of the U.S. Marine Corps, and the 12th and 24th Groups of the Air Force. Today, I, as the Chairman, on behalf of the military and civilians of China, extend our warm and loving congratulations to the military and civilians of our ally, the United States. I am very pleased and honored to be able to meet with the officers and soldiers of the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force today. The officers and soldiers of the 5th Regiment of the 1st Division of the U.S. Army participated in the First World War and have glorious combat records. During the Second World War, they demonstrated the bravery of all officers and soldiers. You fought continuously and arduously against the enemy in the Pacific, landing from Guadalcanal and New Britain to Okinawa, attacking the heart of the enemy, and inflicting a fatal blow to the enemy. The 12th and 24th Groups of the Air Force participated in the liberation of the Philippines and later assisted the Army in landing on Okinawa, achieving brilliant results. Today, after the enemy's unconditional surrender, your army first arrived in Peiping in early October this year, enabling our national army to accept the surrender of the enemy army as scheduled and actively handle the repatriation of enemy military and civilians. Today, I am personally inspecting our allied forces, especially the solemn and well-trained U.S. Marine Corps, and I am truly comforted as if seeing our compatriots who share life and death. During this war, thanks to the joint efforts of all Allied nations, we were finally able to completely destroy our most stubborn enemy and restore world peace and order. Recalling this precious history, we can be sure that as long as all Allied nations can cooperate to the end, we can permanently maintain world peace and promote the welfare of all mankind. In particular, our two countries, China and the United States, have a traditional friendly relationship. As a result of sharing blood during this war of resistance, a friendship that cannot be separated has been forged. I believe that in the future international community, we will be able to love and trust each other, help each other, and share our responsibility to safeguard world peace. Mr. Truman, President and Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force of your country, is committed to promoting cooperation between our two countries. I wish him good health and great success. Now that Christmas is approaching, we are all preparing to piously cherish the Christmas festival of the Lord of Peace, and I wish all officers and soldiers a Merry Christmas." When Chairman Chiang and his wife left the parade ground after inspecting the U.S. military, the onlookers outside the field applauded enthusiastically and shouted "Long Live the Chairman" to express their respect. After the military parade, General Rockey and General Walton hosted a banquet to entertain Chairman Chiang and his wife, and invited Director Li and others to accompany them. After the banquet, Chairman Chiang returned to the office. Madame Chiang visited the women's service team of the American Red Cross this afternoon, demonstrating a strong spirit of Sino-American cooperation. The U.S. officers and soldiers who were inspected were greatly honored and excited by Chairman Chiang's personal visit for the award ceremony and inspection.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Peiping, 16th] President Chiang Kai-shek summoned 146 male and female party members and league members who had been arrested, escaped, and remained in Peiping during the occupation period in North China and Northeast China at the Juiren Hall at 3:00 p.m. yesterday, the 15th. The President was unable to extend his condolences one by one as he had to attend a reception tea party at 4:00 p.m., so he gave a brief speech after taking roll call. He essentially said, "Comrades, you have fought arduously against the enemy and puppets for the party and the country for more than ten years in North China and Northeast China, experiencing life and death and overcoming difficulties. I am truly delighted to see you today. The Founding Father Sun Yat-sen said: 'Revolutionary party members should be nameless heroes.' Comrades, you have taken risks and overcome difficulties in these more than ten years, and your contributions to the party and the country are great, but you have no fame or high position. This spirit of fulfilling obligations without seeking power is the only key to the success of our revolutionary party. If a revolutionary party does not have a number of key members who advocate for their comrades and compatriots with loyalty and integrity, it will not fail. The reason why our party is able to be where it is today and why the War of Resistance ultimately led to victory is due to the successive efforts, sacrifices, and struggles of you comrades. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, I hope that you comrades will continue to uphold the spirit of the past, be the first to worry about the troubles of the world and the last to enjoy its pleasures, serve our compatriots, be loyal to the party and the country, to achieve our goal of realizing the Three Principles of the People. I would now like to offer a sincere prayer for the deceased comrades and offer sincere congratulations to the rescued comrades, and wish success to the future of the revolution." When the President gave his speech, his words were earnest, like a father or elder brother speaking to his children, and the male and female comrades were moved to tears.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper News] A San Francisco broadcast on the 17th stated: General Marshall arrived in Honolulu today and continued his journey to China on the same day. When General Marshall arrived in Honolulu, he received a telegram from President Truman. In the telegram, President Truman expressed his deep hope that General Marshall would do everything possible to complete this great historical mission.</p>
<p>[United News Agency, Honolulu, 16th] General Marshall, the new U.S. Ambassador to China, arrived at the Hickam Air Force Base here today by plane en route to Chongqing. He was accompanied by his secretary, Herrick. Marshall told reporters: "Other than the weather being very good, there is nothing else to say."</p>
<h3>Marshall Arrives in Honolulu, Truman's Declaration Receives Positive Response from All Parties</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper News] A San Francisco broadcast on the 17th stated: After U.S. President Truman clarified his policy toward China, the U.S. State Department expressed its support, and the response from the Chinese side was also positive. A spokesman for the Chinese government declared: "The Central Government fully agrees with the policies clarified by President Truman. Establishing a democratic and united new China is the long-cherished wish of the Chinese government."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Peiping, 17th] People close to Chairman Chiang here and people from all walks of life in China have praised President Truman's statement on China policy with the highest regard. All believe that this statement can strengthen Chairman Chiang's position in the KMT-CPC negotiations.</p>
<p>People close to Chairman Chiang explained President Truman's reference to a "one-party government" by saying: "The leaders of the Kuomintang are aware that the current government is not democratic in its structure, but it is only a transitional 'preparatory government.' They emphasize that although it has been repeatedly postponed, this long-awaited National Assembly will finally be convened in May to formulate a constitutional government."</p>
<p>Various circles in the Kuomintang unanimously condemned the Communist Party for obstructing China's unity, claiming that the Political Consultative Conference had been postponed twice due to the failure of the Yan'an side to send representatives to Chongqing.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 16th] Since President Truman's statement on China policy was issued, the reaction from Congress has been one of agreement. They all believe that this statement has clarified the U.S. policy toward China and hope that Marshal Marshall will be able to successfully complete his mission to China with this statement and the detailed instructions he has received.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 17th] President Truman's statement, which is clearly intended to allow the American people to have an informed understanding, will be generally supported, but it may not satisfy left-wing elements in the United States who demand a policy of "non-interference in China." Those who are particularly opposed are the President's reasons for keeping the U.S. Marine Corps in North China. Opposition from left-wing elements to the President's statement will further clarify the general misunderstandings about U.S. policy toward China.</p>
<h3>The Political Consultative Conference Will Convene Soon, Military Issues to be Thoroughly Discussed</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper News] A San Francisco broadcast on the 17th stated: After arriving in Chongqing, representatives of the Chinese Communist Party visited representatives of the Chinese government today to exchange views.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 17th] The Political Consultative Conference is likely to be held on Christmas. The political and military situation in the past 72 hours has clearly turned in favor of the Central Government. The remarks of Propaganda Minister Wu Kuo-chen represent the optimistic mood of various circles in the government regarding the prospect of ending the civil war. He said: "After Chairman Chiang returns to Chongqing from Peiping, the Political Consultative Conference will be held." It is widely believed that Marshal Marshall, who is scheduled to take office on the 20th, may arrive in time to witness the opening of this historic conference.</p>
<p>[Mass Agency, Chongqing, 17th] Propaganda Minister Wu Kuo-chen stated that the government is planning to organize a coalition government so that the Communist Party can participate in the cabinet and be appointed to other senior official positions. Wu pointed out that on September 2 of this year, Chairman Chiang told Mao Tse-tung that if the KMT and CPC could abandon political prejudices and reach an agreement, the Supreme National Defense Council could be reorganized into the National Supreme Political Conference so that the Communist Party could participate in the government on a broad democratic basis.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 17th] The arrival of General Ye Jianying, Chief of Staff of the Communist Party's Eighth Route Army, in Chongqing to participate in the Political Consultative Conference has greatly excited the Chinese political community, believing that the prospect of achieving comprehensive peace in China is brighter than at any time since Japan's surrender. A government spokesman also expressed satisfaction with the fact that the delegation of the Chinese Communist Party included seven representatives and thirty-five staff members, and believed that General Ye Jianying's personal attendance would enable a more thorough discussion of military issues between the two sides. A Communist Party spokesman declared: "We hope to cease fighting before and during the Political Consultative Conference so that we can negotiate everything, because what China needs is peace, unity, and unification."</p>
<p>[United News Agency, Yan'an, 17th] The Chinese Communist Party's program will be submitted for review at this Political Consultative Conference, but it has not actually deviated from the policies repeatedly announced by CCP Chairman Mao Zedong. It is reported that the Communist Party has brought a draft of a new constitution to Chongqing, advocating the immediate establishment of a provisional coalition government.</p>
<p>[United News Agency, Yan'an, 16th] Four Communist Party representatives to the Political Consultative Conference flew to Chongqing today. Mao Zedong and Zhu De sent them off, and Mao expressed his warm expectations. The seven Communist Party representatives are headed by Zhou Enlai, with Liao Chengzhi as the seventh member. Zhou Enlai said before leaving that he was full of "hope" for the Political Consultative Conference and felt that there was no other way to solve China's problems other than through peaceful negotiations. He considered Truman's declaration to be "good and welcomed it."</p>
<h3>National Army Recaptures Sa County, Communist Army in Sui-Bao Concentrates Along Peiping-Suiyuan Railway</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 17th] The Communist army has abandoned the siege of Suiyuan and Baotou and is retreating to the eastern part of Suiyuan Province.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kweisui, 16th] The Communist army besieging Suiyuan and Baotou is now concentrating along the Peiping-Suiyuan Railway. Those in Baotou are concentrating in Chasuqi and Bikeqi, ninety and sixty li west of Kweisui. At 3:00 p.m. on the 15th, the National Army had recaptured Sa County. Those in the suburbs of Kweisui have also been moving eastward for several days, concentrating around the Qixiaying Station on the Peiping-Suiyuan Railway, ninety li from Kweisui. The rails and sleepers between Baitasi, the first station east of Kweisui, and Qixiaying have been almost completely dismantled and burned by the Communist army.</p>
<h3>General Commander Ho and Others Awarded the Loyal Service Medal</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanking, 17th] For the National Day merit awards this year, the Army Headquarters, on the order of the National Government, awarded the Loyal Service Medal to General Commander Ho Ying-chin and nineteen others. The award ceremony was held at the headquarters on the morning of the 17th. Ho represented the Chairman in awarding the medals, and personally pinned the medals on the left front breast of each recipient amidst the sounds of military music, and delivered a speech. Those who were awarded medals today included Chief of Staff Xiao Yisu, Deputy Chief of Staff Leng Hsin, Cai Wenzhi, Section Chief Xu Wuyan, Niu Xianming, Xu Xilin, Liu Lianyi, Commanders Ma Chongliu, Liu Yongkun, Peng Mengji, and Political Department Director Li Weiguo, totaling eleven officers. The remaining seven officers are not currently in Nanking and will be awarded the medals separately.</p>
<h3>Yunnan Associated University and Other Schools Still Not Resuming Classes Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kunming, 17th] The authorities of Yunnan Associated University, Yunnan University, the British-Chinese Specialized School, and the Chinese-French University had made various preparations for the resumption of classes this morning and had earnestly persuaded the students. This morning, each school rang the bell for classes on time, and the professors went to the classrooms to teach on time. In the morning, students went to class in groups of three or five, but in the afternoon, the strike committee convened a meeting of students to oppose the resumption of classes, resulting in no one attending classes. Currently, the faculty and staff of each school are holding meetings to discuss how to deal with this new development.</p>
<h3>National Government Order</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th] The National Government ordered on the 17th that Wei Daoming be specially appointed as the Plenipotentiary Representative of the Republic of China to sign the International Monetary Fund Agreement and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development Agreement.</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Wang Hosts Banquet for Petrov; Airlift of National Army to Commence Soon; Heavy Snow in Changchun, Temperature -14 Degrees Celsius</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th] Foreign Minister Wang Shijie and his wife will host a banquet for Soviet Ambassador Petrov and his wife at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 7 p.m. on the 18th. Also invited are Counselor of the Soviet Embassy, Mr. and Mrs. Miklasevsky; First Secretary, Mr. and Mrs. Fedelin; Military Attaché, Major General Roschin; Deputy Trade Representative, Mr. and Mrs. Sleyev; Third Secretary, Mr. and Mrs. Kapicha; and from our side, Vice President of the Executive Yuan, Weng Wenhao; Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, Wang Chonghui; Secretary-General Shao Lizi; Vice Minister Gan Naiguang; Vice Minister Liu Cuo; Director Bu Daoming; and their respective wives.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 16th] There was heavy snow here on the night of the 15th, which continued until the morning of the 16th. It gradually cleared in the afternoon, and the setting sun shone, creating a silvery scene. According to veteran farmers, this year's snow is less and later than usual. In the past, large flakes of snow would fall in early October. However, this does not have any adverse impact on crops. It is noted that this is the fourth snowfall in Changchun since the start of winter, the first snowfall being in early November, but in very small amounts.</p>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] San Francisco, 17th (Broadcast) The Chinese government spokesperson stated that regarding the issue of the Chinese army taking over the Northeast, the Chinese and Soviet governments have now decided on the exact steps to be taken.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 17th] According to informed American sources today, the U.S. Army Air Forces Command will order U.S. pilots to transport the National Army to Shenyang and Harbin. This airlift will be carried out by U.S. C-54 four-engine transport aircraft, each capable of carrying 50 or more fully equipped infantrymen, and will begin within two weeks. This matter has been negotiated and finalized between China and the Soviet Union in Changchun. Now, we are waiting for the Shenyang and Harbin airfields to be prepared in advance. Currently, the task of airlift will be undertaken by the Chinese Air Force and China National Aviation Corporation transport planes, but it is feared that the number of aircrafts will be insufficient. Three days ago, Changchun had heavy snow, and the temperature has dropped to fourteen degrees below zero, so, despite the harsh winter, every effort should be made to complete the airlift of the main force of the National Army as soon as possible to avoid being hampered by the cold winter.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 16th] Director Chen Liang, who arrived in Changchun yesterday, will fly to Jinzhou tomorrow morning to continue discussing the issue of National Army supplies with Director Du. Chen told reporters that this trip to Changchun was to exchange views with the Provisional Headquarters on the same issue. Chen met with Chairman Zhang of the Provisional Headquarters Economic Commission on the evening of his arrival and will meet again today. Regarding the supply of the National Army in the Northeast in the future, including food, clothing, medicine, etc., the central government has determined the principle that the government will bear all the costs. This type of supply, especially the daily necessities of officers and soldiers, will all be issued in "precious goods" to avoid the impact of local price fluctuations and to avoid stimulating prices by competing for local purchases. However, if the local authorities can purchase them on behalf of the military and hand them over to the military supply authorities for unified distribution, it would also be a reasonable approach. The clothing required for the National Army currently arriving and preparing to arrive in the north has been prepared for winter, and will be increased or decreased depending on the climate of the station. It is reported that each officer and soldier will be issued one cotton blanket, one or two military blankets, a complete set of winter military uniforms, overcoats, shoes, socks, and leather hats. Units that are to be airlifted to Changchun are already completely equipped. As for the salaries and food allowances of officers and soldiers, reasonable regulations will be made according to the local price index, with the overall goal of ensuring that officers and soldiers are well-fed and clothed, with a surplus. Once the currency system issue is resolved, this issue can be stabilized accordingly.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th] Administrative personnel from the nine provinces and two municipalities of the Northeast, as well as personnel from central government agencies responsible for the Northeast takeover, are successively flying to Beiping and then to Changchun, and it is expected that all personnel will be transported by the 20th. The Preparatory Office of the Northeast Provisional Headquarters, originally scheduled to move to Beiping on the 17th, has been postponed due to the impact of the weather on flights in recent days, and will depart after the takeover personnel have all arrived.</p>
<p>I Come from Guangzhou - Talking About Food, Clothing, Housing, Transportation, Population, Schools, Newspapers by Zheng Yulang</p>
<p>When the China National Aviation Corporation plane rose two or three thousand feet from the Dahe Airport, overlooking the panoramic view of Guangzhou, one could see the densely packed roofs of this Pearl River delta, with the twelve-story "Aiqun Hotel," the central landmark of the city of Five Rams, towering on the Xiti. The Pearl River Iron Bridge, like a giant dragon, spanned the river, connecting transportation between the north and south banks; the red walls and green tiles, ancient and elegant, of the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall inspired awe; the Yuexiu and Baiyun Mountains, even in the depths of winter, could not diminish their greenness, standing tall and overlooking the Pearl River.</p>
<p>Having returned south from Chongqing, and having lived in Guangzhou for more than a month, I had not felt Guangzhou to be particularly lovable. Once in the air, however, overlooking this beautiful landscape, I suddenly felt a sense of reluctance. Perhaps it was because I had not long returned to my hometown of Baiyun, and I was about to depart again. Like lovers who had been separated for a long time and had not yet finished catching up, I was about to embark on a journey again. At that time, I really hated that the plane was flying so fast.</p>
<p>As the plane flew deep into the Baiyun Mountains, I looked down again, but the Cloud Mountains and Pearl River were no longer visible. I was thinking: the landscape is extremely beautiful, but as the largest city in South China, urban construction still needs to put in a lot of effort, taking advantage of this opportunity of the re-establishment of Guangdong.</p>
<p>Speaking of post-war construction, in addition to modern large buildings, roads, and transportation, the urgent task is to first restore the vitality of the city - the vitality of the people's lives and production. Many chimneys in Guangzhou are emitting thick smoke, but unfortunately, most of these are the chimneys of large restaurants. The chimneys of many large and small factories have not yet been seen. Since the official surrender of the Japanese army in South China on September 20th, the number of people returning from northern Guangdong, eastern Guangdong, Sichuan, Guizhou, Hunan, and Guangxi is increasing day by day. The demand for jobs is becoming increasingly urgent. Currently, labor compensation is still acceptable, and the situation of the working class is not too bad. The ones suffering are the skilled workers and middle-level clerical staff. Their employment problem needs to be resolved urgently. According to statistics from relevant authorities, the number of unemployed has reached 30,000 to 40,000. The Machine Workers' Union says that most of the skilled workers who returned after the recovery still do not have jobs. They were all major contributors during the construction period!</p>
<p>There are about 10,000 Cantonese personnel and skilled workers serving in American military agencies in Guiyang, and about 50,000 including their families. Now that the American military agencies have been dismissed, they all have to go home, and their lives will depend on finding employment. This is a major hidden worry behind Guangzhou's bustling appearance. People in central Guangdong are eagerly hoping that the authorities will promote post-war construction and support production to increase people's employment opportunities, and also hope that Cantonese people overseas and in other provinces will invest more.</p>
<p>The population of Guangzhou has increased to over one million, creating a new situation. Merchants from all over are gathering, seeking jobs and doing business, and all have to stay. This has created a golden age for hotels and tea houses. Because hotels are subject to price limits by the Social Bureau, rents are not too expensive, about three-quarters lower than in Shanghai. However, it is still difficult to find a room. For large hotels like the Aiqun, Xin Ya, and White House, you can only get a place to stay by finding a resident you know who is about to leave and "taking over" their room.</p>
<p>"Eating in Guangzhou" is still an undeniable fact. The food is not only good, but also plentiful. There are two types of "plenty": one is that there are many restaurants, exaggerating a bit, on average, one out of every five stores sells food. The second is that there are many varieties. Just the dim sum alone encompasses ancient and modern times, connects Chinese and Western, and harmonizes North and South. "When the autumn wind rises, the snakes become fat." Snake soup is currently the most seasonal delicacy, and many Allied soldiers come from afar to taste it.</p>
<p>The high cost of goods is unimaginable to people far away. The price of rice was 2,200 yuan per dan in September, rising to 5,300 yuan in October, 6,000 yuan in November, and now it is already 8,000 yuan. Daily necessities, foreign goods, and clothing have all risen dramatically. Many people who returned to Guangzhou from Chongqing or Kunming sold all their clothes, hoping to buy new and cheaper ones in Guangzhou, but ended up suffering a great loss. Guangzhou's prices seem to be second only to Kunming. Some say that in the early stages, because counterfeit currency was banned, merchants raised prices to compensate for their losses; later, the circulation of large-denomination red customs gold stimulated prices. Recently, the high exchange rate of Hong Kong dollars has also been a new stimulus.</p>
<p>In terms of transportation, the Guangzhou-Kowloon through train has been running smoothly since it started running on October 16th, but because the locomotives are old, the roadbed is newly built, and the sleepers are damaged, it still takes more than eight hours to arrive on time. Long-distance buses within the city have resumed and are doing well. Water transportation is mostly motorized sailboats and wooden boats. Since the sinking of the "Haizhu" ship on the Guangzhou-Hong Kong line due to a mine, with more than 2,000 deaths, and the explosion and sinking of the "Changming" ship on the Guangzhou-Macau line, with more than 80 deaths, everyone is wary and mostly abandons the sea for land. People are sleeping at the train station waiting to buy early morning tickets. Regarding ships, public opinion believes that the maritime authorities should implement more stringent inspections.</p>
<p>Guangfu Road in Guangzhou is "Wangping Street in Guangzhou." Daguang, Zhongshan, Jianguo, Zhongzheng, and Qianfeng, several newspaper offices are all located there. In the early days of Guangzhou's recovery, there were more than twenty daily evening newspapers, but more than ten were ordered to cease publication by the authorities because they had not obtained registration. Now, in addition to the aforementioned newspapers, there are also Southwest, Yuehua, Seventy-Two Trades Business News, and Qianfeng Evening News. The supply of foreign newspapers has been cut off, and everyone uses local newsprint and flatbed printing presses. Because printing paper is expensive, and the authorities do not allow publication before registration is approved, few magazines are published, and there is a severe shortage of books.</p>
<p>The Lingnan, Guomin, and Guangzhou Universities have all resumed classes. Chungshan University is awaiting the appointment of the new president, Wang Ligong, and has not yet officially resumed classes. Many middle schools have resumed classes, and forty-two municipal primary schools have resumed classes. However, the supply and demand are still far apart, and many young people are still unable to attend school!</p>
<p>Housing is as difficult as in other recovered cities. Because labor and material costs are high, very few houses are being rebuilt. With the large number of returning people, landlords are taking the opportunity to make a fortune, creating various fees such as "shoe money," "hairdressing fees," and "advance rent." Renting a room requires paying a large sum of money upfront. Despite the difficulty in finding housing, those who are returning will eventually return, and everyone wants to go back and see their hometown that they have been separated from for five or six years.

<h3>Soviet Union Announces Establishment of Independent New Government in Azerbaijan Province of Iran</h3>
<p>Washington Believes it Violates UN Principles</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 16th (United Press)] Washington sources believe that Moscow's announcement of the establishment of a "National Government" in the Azerbaijan province of Iran presents Belnas and Bevin with a fait accompli. It is believed that Belnas will oppose this matter because it undermines the sovereignty of Iran and violates the principles of the United Nations.</p>
<p>[USIS, Tehran, 16th] An Iranian government spokesman announced today that the garrison in Tabriz, the capital of Azerbaijan province, has surrendered to the rebels. It also stated that the city of Ruoyeh, 75 miles southwest of Tabriz, has also surrendered to the rebels. TASS News Agency reported that Azerbaijan Province has automatically established a National Government, and the first congress of the province's parliament has elected Shivali as the Premier of the Cabinet. The Provincial People's Congress has requested the establishment of an autonomous government under the Iranian central government. However, TASS did not specify the relationship between the new government in the area and the Iranian central government.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 17th] Shortly before the meeting of the three foreign ministers yesterday, Moscow Radio read a telegram from Tabriz, stating that the Azerbaijan Democratic Army had occupied 40 more towns in the province. This agency's correspondent in Moscow said that the Iranian event is undoubtedly one of the main items on the agenda of the Three Powers Conference. Foreign Minister Bevin had a long private conversation with the British Ambassador to Iran, Puratt, before the meeting, saying that it was to discuss possible developments after the establishment of the Azerbaijan "National Government." Moscow Radio broadcasted again last night that the new Azerbaijan parliament had proposed a plan to "establish and consolidate the natural autonomous life of Azerbaijan under the principle of not damaging the national integrity of Iran."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tehran, 17th] After the fall of Tabriz, the capital of Azerbaijan province, the city of Lancherai, 75 miles northwest of the province, has also been besieged by 3,000 members of the Kochik tribe, the Kurdish tribe, and the Democratic Party. At the same time, the Iranian government has instructed the defense forces in various parts of Azerbaijan province to resist as much as possible, otherwise they can destroy their weapons, surrender, or return to Tehran. It is heard that after the Tabriz defense forces surrendered to the Democratic Party, their officers have set out to Tehran.</p>
<p>Azerbaijan Government Issues Policy Plan</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 17th] Moscow Radio broadcasted last night that the new Azerbaijan parliament, calling itself the National Government, decided, based on the will of the people to establish autonomy to end the people's suffering, that it should announce to the world the existence of the Azerbaijan National Government, which will develop autonomous life under the principle of not harming the national integrity of Iran, obtain national life based on the principle of national self-determination, and establish administrative institutions that conform to public opinion. On the one hand, it will eliminate those responsible for the people's suffering. Autonomous Azerbaijan still recognizes the authority of the central government in Tehran. However, it will also take all necessary measures that do not violate the principle of autonomy. For the sake of protecting autonomy, there will be a militia organization, compulsory free education will be promoted, and the use of the Azerbaijani language will be announced. As much attention as possible will be paid to the development of national industries. In order to eliminate the gradually expanding state of unemployment, it will confiscate the land of reactionary landlords and redistribute it fairly. Farmers account for the majority of the population of Azerbaijan, so they should be allowed to purchase land from landlords willing to sell land, paying a reasonable price. In order to facilitate farmers' purchase of land, farmers' loans will be handled by the Farmers' Bank. In addition, in order to help the unemployed masses, an unemployment relief law should be drafted and a social insurance system should be created. The Azerbaijan National Government should respect the freedom of belief of all citizens and make all residents enjoy equal rights and bear equal obligations. The National Government respects private property in all industries, and should provide assistance to private enterprises that improve the national status and raise the standard of living.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 17th] Moscow Radio broadcasted this morning that the rights and special interests of foreign governments in Iranian Azerbaijan should be fully respected.</p>
<p>Soviet Union Hopes to Negotiate with Iran; US Troops to Withdraw Within a Week</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tehran, 17th] The New York Times correspondent reported that as Iranian left-wing newspapers continue to call for direct Iranian-Soviet negotiations, rumors have emerged that the Soviet government is willing to make some concessions to a more docile Iranian government. It is said that the Soviet government is willing to make the Azerbaijan incident an event between the two countries. However, because the Iranian government has repeatedly stated that it intends to seek international resolution based on the declarations of other countries guaranteeing Iranian sovereignty, this Soviet wish cannot be realized. Recently, five senior Iranian politicians have been appointed by the government to form a committee to study countermeasures for the Iranian northern issue. Former Iranian Prime Ministers Gavan and Mansur are also two of the five. This committee may be regarded by the Soviet Union as a pro-Soviet group, and Gavan invited American financial expert Dr. Mills Bohr to Iran in 1942, so the United States also has a good impression of him. US troops near Tehran may withdraw within a week, leaving only Major General Xuvalskov's military police and the military mission led by Witlai. In addition, the only non-military Americans remaining in Tehran are Dr. Mills Bohr's second financial mission and the American advisors employed by the Iranian Ministry of Agriculture. The poverty of Iran requires the assistance of such foreign experts. The more knowledgeable people in Iran believe that Iran should have a stable, realistic, and popular government. However, they all oppose foreign interference and believe that this government cannot be established as long as foreign forces remain. The current government of Iran can only represent the ruling class, which accounts for less than 2% of the total population, and the various departments of the government are mostly overstaffed. Although the number of employees is large, the salaries are low, and there are many civil servants who hold multiple jobs. Tax evasion and corruption are also rampant.</p>
<h3>Organ of the Communist Party in Moscow Criticizes British and American Policies, Says Democracy is Not a Monopoly</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 17th] The magazine "Bolshevik," an organ of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, criticized Britain's policies in Egypt, India, and other colonies, as well as the imperialist methods of American capitalists, stating: Colonial policies are sufficient to endanger world peace, and the Soviet Union cannot remain indifferent to the distribution of trusteeship territories. The Soviet Union should enable these territories to establish regimes that are sufficient to help dependent nations achieve genuine liberation. The banner of democracy has been erected on the ruins of fascism, but democracy is not the monopoly of a few selected nations. The people of the colonies should also have the right to self-government and self-determination. The magazine "Bolshevik" continued: British policy has repeatedly made promises to India, but today the Indian people still have no political rights, and the Indian government has in fact remained unchanged. Only 14% of the population nationwide has the right to vote. The situation in other British colonies is no better. For example, Sudan and Egypt, British control over Sudan is no different from controlling Egypt. As for the United States, the driving force behind the policy of powerful figures in promoting colonial policy does not focus on the political division of the world, but mainly on occupying a dominant economic position in order to eliminate competition from others. British capitalists have erected various trade barriers in their colonies to prevent other countries from sharing the benefits. The Soviet government has always had effective experience in solving national problems democratically. Therefore, unless the Soviet Union closely participates in the establishment of an international trusteeship regime, the trusteeship system cannot gain a progressive foundation. Otherwise, the trusteeship system will inevitably repeat the mistakes of the League of Nations, and the colonial nations will hardly be expected to achieve final independence.</p>
<h3>British-Siamese Peace Treaty Negotiations</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 17th] Britain and Siam are conducting peace negotiations in Singapore. Although details have not been obtained, it is known that the conditions proposed by the British side are not harsh. The British side requires Siam to cooperate in dealing with the Japanese in Siam and restore British rights and interests in Siam, as well as the rights and interests of neighboring lands under British control. At the same time, Siam is also required to bear part of the responsibility for maintaining security and restoring the economy in Southeast Asia. According to Dan Ning, a political advisor to the Southeast Asia Headquarters, the British government could have drafted a peace treaty and forced Siam to accept it, but the British government did not do so, nor did it send troops to disarm the Japanese army, nor did it forcibly establish a military government in Siam. The Siamese government continues to exercise its powers. The British government has also restored various conveniences to the Siamese King, who is currently in Switzerland, to enable him to return to his country. It is noted that Dan Ning represents the British side in this negotiation, and the leader of the delegation from the other side is Mr. Cai Yangte.</p>
<h3>Commander of US Forces in Korea Issues Proclamation</h3>
<p>[United Press, Seoul, 16th] Lieutenant General Hodge, commander of the US Army in Korea, announced today that any party, whether openly or secretly, attempting to exercise power in Korea will be severely punished. This statement is intended to declare that the United Nations military government is the sole government in Korea today, dealing a major blow to the "Korean People's Republic" and its affiliated troops or personnel.</p>
<h3>American Post-War Industry and Commerce Face a Great Opportunity, Recession Can Be Avoided, Enter</h3>
<p>An Era of Perpetual Prosperity</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 16th] The National Association of Manufacturers recently held its annual meeting here, celebrating its 50th anniversary. Chairman Mr. Ma Xiao delivered a speech stating that American industry and commerce face a great opportunity to lead the nation into an era of perpetual prosperity. The immediate priority is to increase production. To achieve this, private investment must be encouraged, with government cooperation. Both the business community and the government must provide the public with reasons to feel secure, to no longer fear the spread of recession, then perpetual prosperity can be expected. With increased production, everyone in America will have work, wages will be higher, and the people's standard of living can increase endlessly.</p>
<p>Freedom of economic and political choice has always been a fundamental right of every American citizen and must continue unchanged. America has abundant resources, raw materials, manpower, production capacity, and management technology. Increasing production and reducing unemployment are possible, and the first step is to ensure that private capital flows into productive enterprises that need workers. To encourage investment, the following three steps should be taken:</p>
<p>(1) The policies implemented by the government should not make potential investors hesitant; (2) The tax methods should still allow savers to accumulate wealth; (3) The labor policies adopted should not make labor costs too high, resulting in little surplus in business income and no profit for investors.</p>
<p>The domestic tax system should be re-examined. The collection of individual income tax should not discourage the ambition to work hard and improve. Capital gains taxes, which hinder production, should be abolished. Corporate business taxes should be reduced to a level that does not discourage investment, and excessive taxation of corporate income should also be abolished.</p>
<p>In the past five years, very little private capital has been invested in American industry and commerce. If private capital is ultimately excluded, the economic and political system of the United States will inevitably collapse. Therefore, it is not an exaggeration to ensure the flow of private capital into enterprises that employ labor.</p>
<p>In recent years, there has been a policy that also affects the country, namely, special privileges. This policy, whether beneficial to one party or another, ultimately creates turbulent pressure and social dissatisfaction, which is detrimental to the American economic and political system. Therefore, we must eliminate it. One privilege is tariffs, which are often only beneficial to a small number of people while harming the entire country and can be used to reduce production, competition, and employment.</p>
<p>If the United States wants to achieve extreme prosperity, it must not use tariffs to protect or improve the economic position of a certain manufacturer or manufacturing group, but must actively use tariffs to develop and strengthen the basic production capacity of the country. Tariffs should be gradually reduced so that production and consumption can be increased to the greatest extent in a free competitive situation in the United States. However, the rate of reduction should be based on the welfare of the public to avoid sudden impacts on domestic trade and worker employment in the United States. Another privilege involves labor. At the recent management and labor conference held in Washington, management made some very reasonable suggestions, but labor firmly insisted on maintaining the status quo and rejected them all. American labor is unwilling to accept a position of equality with management in terms of law or responsibility, is unwilling to give up the right to strike during negotiations, or to provide any guarantee to capital, labor, or the public in the event of a dispute. They are not "abusers of labor," and anything that harms the basic rights of labor should be vigorously opposed. However, it is felt that today's labor problems should be resolved through legislation.</p>
<h3>Judge of Kyoto District Court Dismissed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Tokyo, 17th Dispatch] Ishihara, a judge of the Kyoto District Court, was recently dismissed for improperly handling the Kondo case. Kondo was an army captain who was arrested by the American army for carrying seven hand grenades, a sword, and a pistol. Ishihara sentenced Kondo to a fine of 200 yen, but according to current military law, Kondo should have been sentenced to 15 months of imprisonment. The Allied Headquarters has also instructed the Japanese authorities not to grant Kondo any government position again.</p>
<h3>Konoe's Suicide Affects Japanese Politics, Will Lead to Hirohito's Abdication, Completely Eliminating Inner Court Officials Feels Lost and Helpless, Asahi Shimbun Recalls Old Events to Exonerate Konoe</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Tokyo, 17th Dispatch] In his urgent suicide note, Konoe has already confirmed that he made major mistakes in the Sino-Japanese War. It is generally believed that this suicide is to take responsibility for the mistakes. Konoe said in the suicide note to his second son, Michitake, "This letter can explain the attitude I have taken in the past few years." The first half of the suicide note said, "Since the outbreak of the China Incident, I have made some mistakes, and I am now very clear about these mistakes."</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 17th Dispatch] Konoe's suicide is a major blow to the prestige and position of Emperor Hirohito. It is generally believed that this will have a major impact on the Japanese imperial family and political circles. Konoe himself expressed concern about the future of the imperial family in his last few hours. This may be a new sign of Hirohito's abdication. Some Japanese believe that Konoe's suicide may be the final factor that promotes the abdication of the Emperor. Hirohito has been deeply moved, without a doubt. Konoe has long been a close aide of the Emperor. The sudden news of his death is as severe as MacArthur's order to the Japanese government to no longer support Shintoism financially. The war criminals repeatedly wanted by MacArthur have almost completely eliminated those around the Emperor, leaving only two close officials who have entered the inner court for fifteen years. The imprisonment of Prince Nashimoto and the inner court are already in a state of emergency. Konoe's death has made Hirohito feel even more lost and helpless.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 17th Dispatch] Asahi Shimbun published the resignation letter of former Prime Minister Konoe to the Emperor on October 16, 1941, stating that Army Minister General Tojo did not allow the withdrawal of troops from China, for fear of affecting morale. (At that time, Japan and the United States were negotiating in Washington, with the withdrawal of Japanese troops from China as a prerequisite for establishing an agreement.) According to Tojo, if Japan made concessions to the United States, the United States would become more arrogant and boastful without end. Although the China Incident could be temporarily resolved, the relationship between China and Japan would break down again in two or three years. Now both sides have weaknesses domestically, so it is advisable not to miss the opportunity to choose a date to launch the Pacific War. Konoe also said that he had met with Tojo four times and knew that he could not change his views, and felt that he could not live up to the Emperor's trust, so he submitted his resignation. Later, Konoe's resignation was approved and Tojo immediately succeeded him. The resignation letter also said that if the Japanese army withdrew from China, there was still a possibility of negotiating with the United States to establish friendly relations. If Japan enters the war, the outcome cannot be predicted today, when the China Incident has not yet ended. Since the outbreak of the China Incident, I have deeply felt the importance of my duties, and it is unreasonable to get involved in a larger war. However, Tojo firmly believed that the Washington Conference had little hope of success, so he insisted on preparing for war. It was decided at the Imperial Conference on September 6 that if there was no progress in the negotiations by mid-October, active preparations for war must be made. The publication of this resignation letter after Konoe's suicide clearly shows that his relatives wanted to prove that Konoe's words in various statements after Japan was occupied, namely, that his resignation was actually caused by the war issue. But at the same time, the Asahi Shimbun commented on Konoe's suicide, saying that his weak nature would inevitably mislead the country, because his weakness made it easy for the war to break out. The general opinion of the Japanese is that Konoe's resignation that day was a sign of weakness. He could not stop the hard-line policies of the Tojo military clique and allowed them to do whatever they wanted, which was a failure of the responsibilities of a senior official.</p>
<p>Remains Left for Public Viewing</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 17th Dispatch] Konoe's remains were placed in his private residence today, following the northern foot and heading south, for public viewing. Konoe's suicide method was poisoning rather than seppuku, which many Japanese despised for its lack of pain. However, in terms of ceremony, it was quite "honorable." Konoe's wife apparently did not know about his intention to commit suicide, as she had packed her bags and was preparing for him to be imprisoned before the midnight deadline. When Konoe's body was discovered, he was wearing pajamas, with a Western-style pillow under his head, his hands peacefully crossed on his chest, and his face was still calm. At the time of his death, he was head east and feet west. His family changed him into a clean white Japanese-style dress and changed the direction to head north and feet south. Three American soldiers stood guard at the small door of the reception room, also taking off their leather shoes according to Japanese customs. Konoe's residence contained Gibbons's monumental work "The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire" and Wilde's collection of poems and essays. A section of Wilde's prose was underlined in red, presumably what he read before taking poison, the translation of which is as follows: "In the society we have created, there is no place for me, nor is there a place for me, but in nature, the sweet rain falls equally on the upright and the wicked. I can find a hiding place in the cracks of the hard rock and cry undisturbed in the quiet air in the secret valley."</p>
<p>Potassium Cyanide Suicide</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 16th, United Press] Konoe Fumimaro committed suicide by potassium cyanide. His secretary, Ushiba, said that although he did not know that Konoe had suicidal intentions, Konoe's wife seemed to know what her husband wanted to do. General MacArthur's headquarters announced that former Prime Minister Konoe committed suicide by poisoning in his residence. He was originally scheduled to surrender to Sugamo Prison today. This news was notified to the Allied Counterintelligence Team by the Japanese Central Liaison Office. The Central Liaison Office apparently obtained this information from people close to Konoe. It is said that he has been extremely troubled and worried since being listed as a war criminal on December 6.</p>
<h3>United Nations Headquarters, Boston and San Francisco, One Will Be Chosen</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 16th Dispatch] The permanent headquarters of the United Nations organization has been decided to be located in the United States.

<h3>The Three-Power Conference Met Again Yesterday, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union Seek Understanding, The Meeting Proceeded in a Friendly Atmosphere</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 17th Dispatch] After a preliminary exchange of views yesterday, the three-power foreign ministers met again this afternoon for more concrete discussions. The three foreign ministers and their entourage were very busy yesterday. Although no communiqué was issued after the meeting, it is believed that the atmosphere was very friendly.</p>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 16th Dispatch] The three-power foreign ministers held their first meeting here today, chaired by Molotov. US Secretary of State Byrnes, British Foreign Secretary Bevin, and their staff attended. It is said that this first meeting was only preliminary in nature. Before the meeting, Bevin met with British Ambassador to Iran, Bulard, who had just arrived from Iran. According to Bevin's statement to reporters, they will discuss the atomic problem "in accordance with policy principles." This statement implies that the British and American foreign ministers have discussed the atomic problem with the Soviet Union for the first time. The British Foreign Secretary also said, "The conference will seek understanding on issues of mutual concern based on realistic principles. We hope to make progress in solving the current difficult issues in the world so that they can be discussed more broadly in the United Nations organization in the end.</p>
<h3>Egypt Approves Participation in International Monetary Agreement</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Cairo, 17th Dispatch] The Egyptian government has approved participation in the Bretton Woods International Monetary Agreement.</p>
<h3>"Little Glass Eyes" and Others Will Be Tried in Yokohama Today</h3>
<p>[United Press, Yokohama, 17th Dispatch] A US military court composed of nine officers met in a cold, dark Yokohama court today to plan the first trial of Japanese war criminals. The life and death of five Japanese defendants accused of abusing United Nations prisoners of war will depend on this.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 17th Dispatch] The first Japanese war criminal trial will be held in a Japanese court here this afternoon. Will "Little Glass Eyes" answer "guilty or not guilty" at that time? "Little Glass Eyes" was originally a guard in a Japanese prisoner of war camp, whose name was familiar to American prisoners of war. His real name is Tsuchiya. "Little Glass Eyes" will be submitted to a military court organized by nine people for trial on the crime of murdering nine Americans. He is also accused of using wooden boards, sticks, and water pipes to torture prisoners of war. The indictment alleges that one of the most enjoyable pastimes of "Little Glass Eyes" was to force Allied prisoners of war to slap each other between two torture instruments for his entertainment.</p>
<h3>The World's Last Remaining Autocratic Monarch, King Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia, Harem Beauties in Groups, Princes and Princesses Too Numerous to Count Accurately, Opposes Freedom of Speech and Publication, Strong Aversion to Jews</h3>
<p>[United Press, Cairo, 16th Dispatch] King Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia, 66 years old this year, is the world's last remaining autocratic king. Since Muhammad I, he is the first person who has been able to rule the largest Arab country. He governs five million people and has the power of life and death over them.</p>
<p>He does not advocate freedom of speech and publication. He especially opposes smoking, drinking, and gambling, and strictly prohibits the intrusion of ubiquitous films into his territory. He uses religion as a political tool. He is a devout believer in the Koran and goes to Mecca, the holy land of Islam, for pilgrimage every year, and he always brings a large group of people with him, including his courtiers, cooks, Islamic leaders, his "current" and "former" concubines, servants, and his grandchildren. This complex group is not pleasing to Westerners.</p>
<p>There is no accurate record of how many children he has. It is said that he once said: In my youth, I established the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Now that I am old, I want to add more people to the country. Someone once estimated that he had a total of 31 officially married and raised princes who are still alive, but this estimate was later considered too small. The king can marry four princesses each time and can marry and choose harem beauties at any time.</p>
<p>Ibn Saud is six feet four inches tall, has a loud voice, is witty, has a strong memory, and is generous by nature. Those who leave him for the first time never leave empty-handed. He welcomes anyone to Palestine except Jews.</p>
<p>Two and a half years ago, he said: I don't know what reason the Jews have to demand to live in Palestine. It is true that Palestine belonged to the Jews for several centuries before Muhammad, but later the Romans defeated them, killed some of them, and expelled some of them. Palestine has not seen any traces of being ruled by them since then. 1,300 years ago, the Arabs took Palestine from the Romans again, and since then Palestine has become the Palestine of Islam. At the end of the last war, Britain allowed the Jews to establish their home in the holy land of Palestine. Ibn Saud said angrily: This will be an unfulfillable promise, just like the empty promise of the Arab government to allow the Jews to live in Devonshire, England. Since Jerusalem is the common holy land of Muslims, Christians, and Jews, we Arabs do not understand why the Jews must choose Palestine as suitable for them to live in. They can find another branch to perch on.</p>
<h3>Britain, the United States, and France Take Consistent Action, Will Break off Relations with Spain, A Decision Can Be Made After the Moscow Conference</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 17th Dispatch] Britain's attitude towards Spain will not be decided until Foreign Secretary Bevin returns from the Moscow Conference. However, according to reports from Washington and Paris, the United States and France may soon clearly announce their attitude towards Spain. France is especially anxious and hopes to take consistent action against the Franco government immediately, such as breaking off diplomatic relations.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 16th Dispatch] Diplomatic sources here expressed their opinion today that the United States will definitely break off relations with the Franco government of Spain. The US Ambassador to Spain, Armour, has already resigned and is now returning home via Paris. According to people in the State Department, it has not been decided who will succeed him. According to the French Foreign Ministry, it has asked the United States and Britain to discuss breaking off relations with the Franco government. US Secretary of State Byrnes and President Truman's advisers have strongly urged the United States to clarify its policy towards Spain. It is said in official circles that it is not enough to break off relations with Spain. At the same time, a declaration should be issued to the Spanish people, explaining that Spain has isolated itself from the international community due to the policies of Franco. The declaration should also specify measures to terminate the Spanish fascist political organization so that it can be suitable for the United Nations organization.</p>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 16th Dispatch] Acting Secretary of State Acheson held an unofficial meeting with former Spanish Republican Prime Minister Dr. Negrín yesterday. This is the first time since 1939 (when the Spanish government still had an ambassador in the United States) that a senior official of the State Department has met with a leader of the Spanish Republican movement at the State Department.</p>
<h3>Burmese Leader Urges the United States to Uphold Justice</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Yangon, 17th Dispatch] General Aung San, chairman of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League of Burma, telegraphed the US President today, asking him to uphold justice for subordinate countries in accordance with the recently decided US foreign policy.</p>
<h3>Japanese War Criminals Will Be Tried for the Murder of Yang Guangsheng and Zhu Shaoping, The Crimes of the Ota Military Police Commander Are Heinous</h3>
<p>[United Press, Manila, 17th Dispatch] It was revealed here yesterday that former Commander of the Japanese Military Police in the Philippines, Lieutenant Colonel Ota, will be charged with the murder of Chinese Consul General to the Philippines Yang Guangsheng, Vice Consul Zhu Shaoping, and their entourage on or around April 17, 1942. The original text of the US indictment against the leader of this military police force was revealed this morning. The indictment states, "On or around April 17, 1942, Ota did unjustifiably and unlawfully allow his subordinates to murder Dr. Yang Guangsheng, Zhu Shaoping, Wang Jinghui, and other members of the consulate. The murder site was the Chinese Cemetery of Santa Cruz in Manila." Zhu Shaoping was the former chairman of the Shanghai World Student Association and was known at the time as R.K. Chu. Wang Jinghui was a famous Chinese diplomat and the son of former Ambassador to the United States Dr. Wang Zhengting. Another formally charged crime of Ota is that from January 2 to September 30, 1942, he allowed his subordinates to torture and inflict illegal punishment on civilians of the United States and its allied and neutral countries, and forced these civilians to bury themselves in the Santiago Fortress and Intramuros in Manila under the most cruel and inhuman conditions. The indictment also states that, in view of the above facts, Ota has violated the wartime regulations and neglected his responsibility to manage the conduct of his subordinates.</p>

<h3>Local Correspondences</h3>
<p>Bangbu: Special Express Trains Added Between Pukou and Xuzhou</p>
<p>Since the realization of victory, although the transportation between Pukou and Xuzhou has been repeatedly disrupted by the Communist bandits, it has been restored to normal operation through the road bureau's active repairs. This section has only received more than forty passenger cars. Except for those that have been transferred or are being repaired, there are only over twenty cars now, and most of them are factory cars, making passengers feel quite cold. With eight trains running, each train can only allocate five passenger cars, resulting in extreme overcrowding for passengers. It is learned that the Huazhong Railway Pukou-Xuzhou Section Management Office, in order to facilitate passengers, is planning to add two special express trains, which are expected to be officially open to traffic around the 20th of this month. However, the entire journey will take ten hours and thirty minutes. Trial runs were conducted twice on the 14th (yesterday), and the results were excellent.</p>

<h3>A Stroll Through Rome and Paris: The First Footprints on Half the World</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent, Zhu Jiarang</p>
<p>Three days after the National Day, I finally realized my long-cherished wish to travel abroad. This trip started from Chongqing, passed through North Africa, crossed the Mediterranean Sea, set foot on the European continent, and then crossed the Atlantic Ocean from the British Isles to reach America, circling half the globe. Covering four continents, I can't help but feel it was a grand tour. Although I had a mission to accomplish, it was a whirlwind tour everywhere, but the impressions I gained are still worth mentioning, especially since this trip took place after the war. Although peace has arrived, I saw and heard many wartime phenomena. The so-called post-war Europe and America is actually the general dynamic of the transition from wartime to peacetime.</p>
<p>Departing from Chongqing, Taking the Route to India to France</p>
<p>The first major stop when leaving Chongqing was Calcutta, India, as everyone knows. Although Calcutta is located in the tropics, the climate at that time was quite similar to Chongqing, not hot at all, and there was no need to sweat. The cityscape is somewhat like Shanghai, but the area is larger and the roads are wider than Shanghai. Due to the successive departure of American troops, the prosperity of Calcutta may be affected in the future, but at this time and place, it is still bustling and very lively. Large companies and department stores are crowded with people. Although prices are high, even higher than Chongqing, they are not restricted and can be freely purchased, making the market more active. Calcutta is rich in materials and comfortable to enjoy, which will be even more noticeable when you arrive in Europe later.</p>
<p>I remember leaving Calcutta on October 16th, and from then on, a long flight began. There were flights from the British Overseas Airways Corporation from India to Europe, but because the Priority Certificate from New Delhi never arrived, I temporarily changed to a plane from the American Air Transport Command (ATC). It is also necessary to obtain a Priority Certificate to take the ATC, but the Americans are very efficient. After only a few hours, the reply from New Delhi arrived, and we immediately bought tickets. That night, we moved into their airport accommodation to wait for the departure early the next morning. In this way, we also experienced the huge scale of the American air transport organization and how busy their service was. The scope of the airport is so large, and all kinds of planes take off and land one after another, making it noisy day and night. There are also these large and small vehicles that are also very busy, running back and forth. Although the time is already after the war, the way they work is still like wartime. It is even more possible to know the greatness of their contribution by imagining their tense and busy wartime. I can't help but express my deep respect!</p>
<p>The American ATC organization is spread all over the globe. Their mission is to transport important people and goods related to combat to the place where they should be as soon as possible. Due to the division of regions, China, India and Burma are one region; the North African part from Karachi in northwestern India to Casablanca in West Africa is another region; and then Europe across the Mediterranean is another region. Our trip is to experience their three regions, so we may stop for a while in each region in order to check the level of the Priority Certificate we hold and then determine the order of departure. Our Priority Certificate was not the highest, so we were "detained" for a while in Karachi and Cairo.</p>
<p>ATC Transport Planes, 160,000 Miles of Voyage</p>
<p>According to themselves, ATC has more than 1,000 transport planes, flying all over the world, with a total voyage of 160,000 miles. Although it is military transport, all the equipment is as comfortable as civil aviation. Every stop has a well-organized residence and dining hall, so you don't feel any pain. The airport is very far from the city, so there are special cars to pick you up and take you on sightseeing tours. As for the equipment of each airport, not to mention the ground buildings directly related to flying, how huge and complete they are to meet the needs of frequent takeoffs and landings; even other ordinary daily necessities are almost all available, without showing any "simplicity" or "sloppiness." For example, the hospital in Karachi is much better than any hospital in Chongqing. Many of the ATC staff are students who enlisted in the army. Purity and harmony are their characteristics.</p>
<p>It takes eight hours to fly from Calcutta to Karachi, and another eleven hours to fly to Cairo. This section completely flies along the Arabian Sea, flying straight into the Persian Gulf, passing Abadan (a key point in the Near East), crossing the deserts of Iraq, Greater Syria, and entering Egypt. When we arrived in Cairo, it was not yet dawn, so we were taken to the accommodation to rest. This is all desert area. Many buildings at the airport are built on the distant and thick sand. People's leather shoes are never clean.</p>
<p>When you arrive in Egypt, you must visit the pyramids and the museum. We were guided by an American travel agency, and spent more than ten US dollars to provide cars and guides, circling around all day to admire the symbols of this ancient culture; here is the Nile River, quietly lying in the not too distant area. This fertile and beautiful river is dotted with countless sails, like a painting. It nurtured the civilization of Egypt and wrote many brilliant histories; on the other side is the world-famous Sahara Desert, experiencing how vast the universe is and the endless road to walk, and realizing that life is so small! The Egyptian Historical Museum is the source of the world's ancient culture. A large building houses countless historical relics, especially sarcophagi and mummies, which are the most valuable data for archaeologists. Also, the three major mosques in Cairo are historically old and architecturally great, which is beyond initial expectations. The Cairo market is also very lively due to the wartime prosperity, and the population has exceeded one million! Although the roads in the central area are a bit narrow, the buildings on both sides are quite tall and complete, and the traffic is noisy. The expanded new urban area is even more beautiful and elegant, quiet and lovely. Most Egyptians have been westernized and wear suits, but they still wear Egyptian-style cylindrical top hats on their heads, with few exceptions. There are many coffee shops and hotels on the street, and many extend to the sidewalks outside the door, drinking and watching the scenery, which is the same as Paris. Egyptians seem to be very leisurely. They are not too nervous. After the war, in addition to being almost invaded by the Nazis, because of its location at the junction of East and West, business is quite good (now there are still many materials that are relatively cheap and easy to buy.) Generally speaking, it is very stable, unlike the general decline in Europe.</p>
<p>Red Flag Hanging Empty on the Railing: Mussolini's Old Office</p>
<p>It takes only one day to fly directly from Cairo to Paris, but the weather in Europe is erratic in winter, which made us stay in Rome for two days, but gave us the opportunity to wander around; although the mood to hurry is so anxious. This historical city of Rome has been disgraced under Mussolini's dictatorship in the past, but the city is still worth praising and very cute. That day, we entered the city from the airport, and it was only 4 pm. The sky was very bright, and we could see all the scenery. The cityscape is not as wide as Paris, but the architecture is very magnificent, and the traffic is very complete. Especially the artistic talent of the Romans seems to fill the entire city, overflowing in every corner. Any place is beautiful, admirable and unforgettable. Generally speaking, the urban design in Europe has many squares (Sanare), similar to wide intersections. Rome has no place without huge sculptures, monuments or magnificent fountains, making the city air so harmonious and lively. The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Rome is the greatest sculptural building, located in the central bustling area, behind the Great Gate, the Colosseum and the ancient theater, which are already ruins; in front is adjacent to Mussolini's former office, a building that is not very tall but very wide, with a not very spectacular exterior but a very particular interior. The balcony where Mussolini used to yell at the people is still the same, but where is the hero of the world now? Only a red flag was seen hanging on the railing, and it is said that some exhibition was being held inside.</p>
<p>The most quintessential area of Rome is the Vatican and St. Peter's Church. We know that the Vatican is now an independent country, but it is all religious in origin, and the situation is different. The police uniforms are still traditional from the Middle Ages. Those who guard the Vatican City are all armed with ancient spears, and it is almost suspected that this life is what age? The Vatican City and Rome are really connected geographically. Although there is a city, the scope is very small, but you don't know that it not only still has the authority of historical, religious and cultural heritage, but also marvels at the splendor of its museum and the richness of its collection! Because of the long time and the vast space, every inch of the Vatican City Museum represents the contribution and achievement of countless writers and artists in the world! No inch is wasted or sloppy. Any rare treasure in the world is concentrated here. When I describe the magnificence of this museum here, I don't know where to start from, and it is difficult to find appropriate words to describe it. Just one sentence: To see the world's rare treasures, you don't have to go anywhere else when you get to the Vatican. I don't know if this is too much? Peter's Church, completed in the thirteenth century, is also one of the oldest and largest world landmarks. The bronze statue of Peter inside is a sculpture from the fifth century. Italian architecture has always been famous, but it also benefits from the easy availability of building materials. Europeans build houses all with stone, so unless they are destroyed by humans, they can always be passed down for a long time, and they will not change for centuries. This St. Peter's Church is especially a masterpiece. The wide square is surrounded by countless long corridors and stone pillars. The stone tower in the square pierces the clouds. This is the exterior. Climbing up the steps of the hall, this building is not decorated with gold and jade. Strangely, it is all made of beautiful bricks and stones, similar to coral agate piled up. The interior is full of carvings, and the atmosphere is ever-changing, which is indeed a world masterpiece.</p>
<p>Entering France from Italy, the Post-War Atmosphere is Extra Strong</p>
<p>Stepping on Europe is naturally the atmosphere of Europe. What I mean by atmosphere here is not someone else, but the post-war scenery is expressed more realistically. In Rome, because of the constant preservation of historical and cultural relations, except for the airport being bombed, no traces of destruction have been seen; but the general atmosphere of withering and decline is undeniably revealed on the streets and in everyone's heart. Everyone knows that since Italy was brought down by Mussolini, its military has been destroyed and its economy has collapsed. Before the peace treaty has been arranged by the foreign ministers' meeting, it is generally still under the control of the Allied authorities. Italy's industry was also very important before the war (their achievements are still beyond the reach of our current situation in China, and this observation has increased our vigilance.) But the war brought decline, and the national economy is now in a stage of decline and turmoil. The general living standard of Italians is still high in terms of clothing, housing and transportation. Everyone is well-dressed, lives in Western-style buildings, and the transportation is smooth when going out; but the enjoyment of food has been reduced. Milk, eggs and meat are generally lacking, and most of them are replaced by artificial fakes. Prices are high, which shows that the currency is inflating, there is a panic of materials, and the black market is rampant. One US dollar is officially priced at one hundred lira, but it can be sold for four or five hundred on the black market.</p>
<p>After passing Rome, we entered France. We landed in Marseille first and did not get to enter the city for sightseeing, but looking from afar, Marseille was still bustling with people. This place is the hub port for Sino-French transportation in peacetime. Recently, I heard that there are already ships sailing to the Far East, and many Chinese students studying in Europe will take ships from here to the East to return to China via Vietnam. It usually takes only two hours to fly from Marseille to Paris, but the weather was extremely bad during this period, and the flight was greatly affected. When we were about to arrive in Paris, the plane kept shaking, almost making people vomit. Fortunately, it landed soon, and we finally completed this long journey safely.</p>
<p>Paris, the world-famous metropolis, is now in the real world, and it is indeed worthy of its reputation. It is a typical standard city. Paris is considered first-class in terms of various conditions: in terms of climate, it is not hot or too cold. Parisians have never been unable to cover themselves with quilts on summer nights, and electric fans are rarely used; in terms of region, it is located in the center of the country, although it is slightly to the north, it is a key point of transportation, and the beautiful Seine River runs through the city, and Parisians have built countless bridges of various styles to add a lot of scenery. Paris has a history of 2,000 years. Emperors of all dynasties have always made their capital here. The brilliance and richness of the palaces show the power and enjoyment of the old royal family; and the accumulated construction, plus the development of modern municipal administration, Paris has indeed reached its peak. The talent and endurance of the French, as well as their achievements, are indeed admirable.</p>
<p>When the plane was about to land, the bird's-eye view of Paris gradually gave people a new impression: the design of the new city street looked like a neat square, and the houses were not as high as New York's, but each one was a huge building, with thousands of windows and hundreds of households, and people were entering and exiting like ants. The city of Paris first originated on a small island in the Seine River, and now the scale is more than a hundred times larger, and Napoleon's Arc de Triomphe has become the central right of the city. The Champs-Élysées Avenue connected to it is as wide as Shanghai's Avenue Edward, just the sidewalks on both sides. Yes, the clarity and tone of the Paris city area are completely wide and open. The trees along the road are lush, reflecting the huge houses that are close to each other, but the interior is golden and magnificent, perfect and beautiful, and it can be imagined that the lives of Parisians are at a very high level.</p>
<p>Underground Trains as Dense as Spider Webs, Using Elevators to Go Up and Down</p>
<p>The main expression of the Paris municipal administration, in addition to the construction of residences, should be transportation. In addition to the Renault and Fiat small cars made by France itself, which are speeding like dragons and water all day long, the greatest engineering and design is the underground tunnels, which cannot but be admired. Because the ground buses were requisitioned by the military authorities and have not yet been returned, there are not many buses due to gasoline. The city's main traffic relies on underground tunnels. Thousands of people travel north and south underground all day long, spending only two francs to travel all over the territory, and the speed is high and the use is convenient. As long as the direction is not wrong, any stranger can learn a little bit, and then follow the map to find anything they want. They will not get lost and cannot find their way home. The Paris underground train network is very dense and complicated, and the routes are stacked on top of each other. Some pass through the riverbed, and some go straight into the deep layer, requiring elevators to go up and down. The difficulty of the project is staggering; and the management is strict, and not many people are used. Except for the fact that the air is a bit poor due to the crowd and some ground or lack of cleanliness, there is simply nothing to criticize.</p>
<p>In the city and suburbs, there are ancient sites and scenic spots everywhere, making people linger and reminisce. The famous Palace of Versailles is a historical landmark in the suburbs, and the ruins of Louis XIV are still as yellow as ever. The music of the small chapel in the rich palace is still preserved today. I remember that when we went to visit that day, they specially played music to show their welcome. In another part, you can also see the place where the peace treaty of the First World War was signed, but after twenty-seven years, who knows that France has experienced many vicissitudes of life. Now, the troubles remain, and looking back, the tomb of the former tiger prime minister has been arched, and I really don't know what to feel!</p>
<p>The Arc de Triomphe and Napoleon's Tomb are the climax of French martial arts. The Arc de Triomphe is now also known as the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, to commemorate the nameless heroes who sacrificed in the Great War of 1914-18. The towering giant shows its antiquity in terms of color. A flame at the bottom spurts out from the ground and never goes out, symbolizing that the national soul is still breathing. There are fresh flowers and wreaths piled up on the bronze monument all year round, especially on November 11, which is the place where all people mourn. Napoleon's Tomb, the place where the giant rests, is also attached to the Museum of War Relics of the Napoleonic Era. Countless thousands of armors, knives and spears, as well as battle flags, earth cannons, portraits, and medals, are scattered in it. France's artistic, book and museum talents are indeed very high. I have visited the Animal Kingdom and the Animal and Mineral Samples, as well as the Louvre Museum. Everyone must admire the grandeur of the content and the depth of the achievements.</p>
<p>New Street Fighting Bullet Marks, Blood Stains Still Not Dry That Day</p>
<p>Parisians often regard the Eiffel Tower and the Opera House as their masterpieces, and in fact, these two major constructions do have their deserved value. The Eiffel Tower started construction early, but it was not completed until 1889. It is 985 meters high and cost 7,000 tons of iron. You can take an elevator or walk up, and you can see the city scenery. Its engineering is naturally great. The Opera House is located in the downtown area and still performs ancient operas. It is full every night, and it is very difficult to book tickets, but some people go to appreciate the music and its architecture, because it is too luxurious, extravagant and impeccable.</p>
<p>Living in Paris due to the interlacing of these beautiful environments is indeed somewhat happy; but perhaps it is too enjoyable and leads to pleasure, which led to the tragedy of 1940. The French have learned their lesson and should be alert; especially after the war, although the city has not been damaged, some places still have street fighting bullet marks, and the bloodstains of the underground army fighting in the underground tunnels have not been completely dried; reflecting the poverty of the daily life of Parisians today, the post-war depression in France is indeed quite deep. To give a few examples: France's coal shortage has not been resolved, and the city's electricity is cut off in districts like Chongqing. The weather has reached the time when it should be lit, but where is the coal? It seems that we have to endure the winter. Some large hotels, despite their pre-war equipment, are very proud, and the waiters are all in evening dresses; but because there is no coal, many have no hot water supply. Toilet paper in toilets has been replaced by old newspapers in many places due to lack of materials. Speaking of the problem of food, the exquisite plates are filled with potatoes and cabbage. Fish is very good, chicken is too little, and there is no need to mention eggs and milk. Only wine is still very abundant. France is a good place to drink wine. The cafes and hotels along the street are magnificent, and it is too cheap to spend a few francs.</p>
<p>Due to the lack of materials, Paris is facing the same difficulties as other countries after the war. The two major livelihood issues of clothing and food are not easy to solve, so a quantitative rationing system is also implemented, but general luxury cosmetics and women's products still seem to be everywhere, and you can ask for whatever you want as long as you are willing to pay a high price. The few large department stores in Paris look very novel, but there are few men's needs, and most of them do women's business. In fact, there seem to be more women than men in Paris. The shop clerks, municipal workers, and even the streets are full of young women coming and going. Merchants are still keen regardless of whether they are Chinese or foreign.</p>
<p>Paris was originally a place in Europe that attracted tourists before the war. Today, British and American tourists have not yet come on the market, but American children are coming in batches for sightseeing. They are transferred from all over Europe to rest. The American Red Cross has a special guide organization to entertain them, which directly contributes to the repatriation of Paris. It is said that there is a surplus of women in Paris. This is a very good way out. It is fashionable to marry an American husband and go to the New World.</p>
<p>In summary, the impression I got in Paris is that the historical tradition and brilliance, as well as the talent of the French nation, are superb, but it seems that they have been a little looser in this century. The political instability has not been eliminated until recently. De Gaulle has been supported, but the hard-line demands of the Communist Party almost prevented him from forming an obstruction. We understand that De Gaulle is trying to govern, but if there is no stable political situation, France's recovery is still lacking in guarantee. The economic malaise is now universal, and mainly depends on the cooperation and assistance of the United Nations and the restoration of industry, so that it can be quickly recovered. The current currency and material black market is indeed in a bad situation, but the main reason is still the re-creation of national productivity. As of the time of writing, France is working hard to nationalize industry and banks. The time when the Bank of France will be nationalized will be realized soon. But a more important principle seems to be social reconstruction. As mentioned above, the French, based on the legacy of their ancestors, inevitably tend to pleasure, but now to rebuild the Fourth Republic of France, we hope that French friends will work harder and bury their heads for another ten years! The habit of waiting on women is not bad, and the atmosphere of kissing along the way is also harmless, but because everyone's shoulders are heavier after this victory, how should we encourage each other to maintain the permanent peace and prosperity of the future world? We cannot ignore the fundamental revival of a society, but must work more seriously and with more responsibility!</p>

<h3>Four Japanese War Criminals Under International Law</h3>
<p>Wartime Cabinet Members, Now Prisoners</p>
<p>Here are four Japanese war criminals with hideous faces, who have been listed by MacArthur in the first list of forty war criminals. From right to left: (Top row) Nobusuke Kishi, Minister of Commerce in the Tojo Cabinet, Kunihiko Hashida, Minister of Education, (Bottom row) Yatsushi Murata, Ambassador to the Philippines, and Tsutose Iwamura, Minister of Justice. All parties firmly advocate severe punishment for this group of war criminals. It seems that none of them can escape the international legal net. Because this is an unprecedented blood debt on the Pacific and Chinese fronts, shouldn't we repay our Chinese and our allies with the blood of Japanese war criminals?</p>
<h3>Editorial: President Truman Reaffirms China Policy</h3>
<p>At the time when his special envoy, Marshal Marshall, was departing the U.S. for China, and the Foreign Ministers' Conference of the Three Nations was convening in Moscow, President Truman issued a statement on his China policy, reiterating the U.S. national policy toward China. President Truman first stated that the U.S. government believes that a strong, unified, and democratic China is of great importance to the success of the United Nations organization and world peace. For the important interests of the United Nations and the United States, the Chinese people must not miss the opportunity to reconcile domestic differences through peaceful negotiations. The U.S. government believes that two points are extremely important: (1) The fighting between the National Government and the Communist army or other miscellaneous armies must stop; (2) A national conference including representatives of all major political groups must be convened to resolve domestic disputes as soon as possible and ultimately achieve China's unification. He also said that the United Nations and the United States only recognize the current National Government as the only legitimate government of the Republic of China, and only the National Government is the proper instrument to achieve China's unification. In addition, he also elaborated on the Northeast, U.S. troops stationed in China, and other points.</p>
<p>President Truman's statement is sufficient to completely clarify the somewhat unclear situation caused by Ambassador Hurley's resignation. It has great benefits for the development of the international and Chinese situation.</p>
<p>The first thing we want to point out is that President Truman's statement is, in general, a continuation of the traditional U.S. policy toward China. What is this traditional policy? It is the U.S. policy toward China since the late nineteenth century of supporting the establishment of a strong, unified, and democratic China. Since the establishment of the National Government, its purpose has been to establish a strong, unified, and democratic China. This nation-building work was hindered by the Japanese invasion, which finally triggered our country's eight-year War of Resistance. The arduous War of Resistance, under the leadership of the National Government, achieved victory, which was a necessary stage for China's nation-building. After the surrender of the enemy, the National Government was responsible for the task of accepting the surrender and taking over, but in carrying out this task, it encountered the destruction of the Communist Party. The Communist army was not subject to the control of the central government and attempted to expand its occupied areas, which they called the "liberated areas," and thus did not hesitate to use force to suppress the national army that was carrying out the task of accepting the surrender and taking over. The National Government has never attempted to use force and hopes to resolve the Communist Party issue through political means, as it has done in the past few years, and as it is doing now. Therefore, President Truman's desire to immediately stop the conflict is in line with the wishes of the Chinese people and the policy of the National Government. However, whether the Communist Party army can put the overall national interest first and immediately stop armed separatism, destroying China's unification, still seems to be a question as of today.</p>
<p>President Truman also pointed out that in order to assist the National Government in eliminating Japanese forces in China, the United States must currently send naval and ground forces to be stationed in China. This is a very wise decision. Although the Japanese army on the Chinese battlefield has already surrendered, some have not yet surrendered their arms, and 1.3 million Japanese troops in China are awaiting repatriation. These are all related to the war. Although the fighting has ended, the war has not yet completely ended. The mission of the U.S. military in China is, on the one hand, to assist the National Government, and on the other hand, to carry out its own mission and the common mission of the United Nations in the war against Japan. In order to deliberately undermine the National Government's work of accepting the surrender, the Communist Party army has not hesitated to create many incidents, such as attacking the U.S. military and spreading calls for the U.S. military to withdraw from China. Its purpose is nothing more than to use force to resolve the National Government's army accepting the surrender, expand their occupied areas, and obstruct China's unification. The Chinese people feel that for the sake of China's interests, the United States' interests, and the United Nations' interests, the U.S. troops stationed in China absolutely need to continue to be stationed in China until they have completed their mission. The armies of China and the United States fought side by side with the enemy in Burma and India; they should also complete their unfinished mission side by side.</p>
<p>As for abandoning one-party rule and implementing constitutional government, this has also been a consistent policy of the National Government. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek announced this spring that the National Assembly would be convened this year, but it was postponed to May of next year due to the Communist Party's opposition. The convening of the Political Consultative Conference was originally intended to accommodate representatives of all parties and social elites to discuss national affairs together, but the convening of the conference was repeatedly postponed due to the Communist Party representatives arriving late. All of this clearly shows that the reason why the current Chinese situation has not been peacefully resolved is due to the Communist Party's deliberate sabotage. What we want to emphasize is that the Chinese Communist Party is different from the Communist Parties of other countries. The Communist Parties of other countries do not have armed forces and do not have their own governments, while the Chinese Communist Party not only has armed forces, but also independently organizes governments to exercise political power. These are all intolerable under national law. In terms of legal principles, the Chinese Communist Party can never stand on an equal footing with the National Government as a negotiating opponent; but the National Government has repeatedly negotiated with it to accommodate the facts, which is enough to show the National Government's tolerance. President Truman said: "The existence of independent and autonomous armies like the Communist Party's army is incompatible with China's unification and makes political unification impossible." This is truly a telling statement. In the process of implementing unified democracy, the Chinese Communist Party must first hand over its army. This is another proof that President Truman has insight into the crux of the Chinese situation.</p>
<p>Regarding the United States' assistance in our industrial and agricultural reconstruction, reorganizing and training our country's military organization, and providing loans to promote Sino-American trade, etc., the Chinese people, after suffering from a long war, will naturally feel excited and inspired by the good intentions of our allied nations. China is facing the arduous task of post-war reconstruction and needs the assistance of allied nations. We hope that the release of President Truman's statement can promote the awakening of the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party, and after the Communist Party representatives such as Zhou Enlai and Ye Jianying arrive in Chongqing, we sincerely hope that they will put the overall situation first and sincerely participate in the Political Consultative Conference, so that the National Government's desire to peacefully resolve all political issues can be achieved, and a strong, unified, and democratic China can be successfully built. Only in this way can we live up to the expectations of our allied friends.</p>

<h3>Large Investors Sell at High Prices; Gold Market Lacks Momentum; Next-Day Delivery System Piloted Yesterday</h3>
<p>The price of gold bars was quite stable yesterday, but people's sentiment continued to waver, so the rise lacked momentum and was easily taken advantage of by short sellers. In the afternoon, brokers began to pilot next-day delivery transactions for one hour, but the trading volume was very small. On the bond market, rumors circulated that "Sun Bonds" would be issued early next month. After opening in the morning, prices gradually rose to 759,000. Large investors showed little interest in funds and sold off at high prices, gradually falling back. In the afternoon, short sellers used the next-day delivery system, and prices weakened, falling to below 730,000 at one point, but the trading volume was not large. In the end, prices hovered around the opening price, resulting in a slight increase of 6,000 compared to last Saturday. Gold jewelry shops quoted 79,000, tael silver 600 yuan, and silver dollars still hovered below 450 yuan. Secret interest rates were pulled up by brokers who fiercely dragged down public bonds and Chinese stocks, gradually finding a way out. Interest rates also rose to 8 fen and 1 jiao.</p>
<p>The price of U.S. dollars initially strengthened but then weakened. Speculators have gradually become indifferent to this, advancing and retreating with the price of gold. Buyers still surged in, rising to around 1,275 yuan, but later, as the gold market weakened, sellers dumped physical goods, declining steadily. In the afternoon, it once retreated to the closing price of last Saturday, but the result was still a squeeze up of 10 yuan. Hong Kong dollars had no special characteristics, and the closing price was similar to that of last Saturday, but supply exceeded demand.</p>
<h3>Rumors of "Sun Bonds" Being Redeemed are Quite Prevalent; Public Bonds Soar; Both Reached 720 Yuan; Chinese and Foreign Stocks are Also Flourishing</h3>
<p>Public bonds continued to soar amidst the clamor of speculation. Rumors circulated that Shanghai public bonds would be redeemed with the "Sun Bonds" planned to be issued early next month, and that the exchange rate of "Sun Bonds" was extremely high. Buyers were like fish in water, pushing Class C bonds to the seventh heaven. In the afternoon, they continued to rise to around 720 yuan, while miscellaneous brands were abandoned like relics, unable to keep pace. As a result, the closing price rose by 75 yuan to a strong 100 yuan compared to the previous session.</p>
<p>After profits were made in the bond market, floating capital flowed into Chinese stocks. After the gold market and U.S. dollars became sluggish, banks also came to favor them. Under the environment of superior interest rates, Mei Ya continued to be surrounded by buying interest. Under the speculation, it almost approached the 400 yuan mark. Among the small-cap stocks, Xin Guang still ranked first, and the rest followed suit. As a result, cotton mills rose by 75 yuan, Mei Ya rose by a good 90 yuan, Xin Guang by 6 yuan, Jing Fu by 4.5 yuan, and Qin Yu only by 2 yuan. After the close, large investors continued to purchase, remaining extremely quiet. Capital saw change and moved, without unexpected attacks. The market may advance.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks were initially flat, but the asking prices were mostly false. Floating capital in the securities industry gradually came to inquire, suddenly presenting an image of demand exceeding supply. The buying interest that had been lurking for a long time could not be contained once it was released. Yi Sha rose by 220 yuan compared to last Saturday, and it was still the buying price. The rest rose by 10%. There was demand but no supply for unpopular stocks, resulting in a buying price for all stocks at the close. After the close, the asking price for Yi Sha increased to 1,600 yuan, and Yi Beer paper industries were all above 400 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yarn Sales Develop; Merchant Groups Seek Spot Goods</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market was firm and people's sentiment was stable. The price of green gold was stable, and sales developed. The Tongzhou group had a strong demand for 16-count coarse yarn, actively searching for spot goods. Some merchants from Jiangxi brought in above-waist yarn, but only targeted those with tax invoices to guarantee spot delivery, with an increase of about 20,000 to 30,000. Stacked bills were not inquired about. Fine yarn and thread also followed suit, rising by 50,000. According to the trend, the yarn market is still in a state of consolidation.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Has Ups and Downs</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were still many arrivals of japonica rice, and the market was flat. Indica rice was scarce and firm, and there was less inventory of white yuan, with supply unable to meet demand, becoming higher and more solid, seeing an increase of 300 to 400 yuan. Yang Indica also increased by 300 to 500 yuan. The turnover of high-priced goods in the oil market was relatively smooth, while the middle and inferior grades were very sluggish. Ningbo merchants slightly purchased flour, but the local demand was flat due to the listing of flat-priced flour. Zhejiang merchants slightly traded soybeans, rebounding by 200 to 300 yuan, and bean cake was still scarce.</p>
<h3>Asphalt Trend Improves</h3>
<p>After a sharp drop, the price of asphalt slightly rebounded. Also, it is currently the season for candle making. According to letters from various producing areas, the situation has also improved. Yesterday, brokers in this city offered Jiashan native grass oil for 20,000 yuan and Lanxi oil for 14,500 yuan. Hankou oil continued to arrive, so although the market saw a good trend, it could not be expected to rise too much.</p>
<h3>New Exchange Rate Undecided; Silk and Tea Transactions are Dull</h3>
<p>Raw silk transactions were dull, with only a dozen packages sold. Prices were slightly weak, probably because the exchange rate was undecided and people were cautious.</p>
<p>Tea transactions were more lively for fried green and baked green teas. Various black teas were flat. It was heard that foreign firms such as British Zhuang Xie He had inquired about purchasing, and that a certain export company was promoting exports to American firms.</p>
<h3>Demand for White Coal Increases Sharply</h3>
<p>As the coal market entered the cold winter, the demand for household white coal increased sharply, and the absorption of the industry became stronger. However, the industry's white coal inventory was thin, and the flat-price allocation took time, leading holders to start raising prices again, and the market became prosperous. Large households' actual sales of bituminous coal did not move, and remained stable. Although retail sales of firewood and charcoal were busy, the agricultural work in the producing areas had passed, and transportation was simple, so they were all splitting firewood and transporting it to Shanghai, with supply exceeding demand, making it difficult for the market to recover.</p>
<h3>Economic Briefs</h3>
<p>The China Tobacco Company, which was operated by the enemy and puppets, has been taken over by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The affiliated first, second, and third tobacco factories are preparing to resume work. It is estimated that the various expenses required for the first month, including the replenishment of raw materials, will cost approximately 100 million yuan in legal tender.</p>
<p>Guangdong province has always felt the shortage of grain and fuel. This year, there was a harvest failure. The Guangzhou People's Food and Fuel Flat-Price Purchase and Sales Association is preparing to purchase foreign rice from Taiwan, Vietnam, and Thailand. The Four-Bank Joint Council has approved the association to make remittances to the Five-Bank Bureau, with a limit of 200 million yuan.</p>
<p>Various manufacturers who were forced to buy by the enemy and puppets are now collecting documents and appealing to the government for relief in accordance with the law. Those who wish to participate can contact the North Gate Street, 11 Deli Nei.</p>
<p>Since the China Merchants Bureau established the Inland River Steamship Management Office, most of the original routes on the inland river routes have been restored. The Shen-Hang line is also scheduled to depart from Shanghai at 8:00 AM on the 20th of this month.</p>
<p>Registration of enemy banknotes in the recovered area began yesterday and will last for one month. Anyone holding enemy banknotes should handle it in accordance with the law and on time.</p>
<p>The American firms, Mei Fu Hang, De Tu Gu, and Ya Xi Ya's Three Fire Oil Companies, have sufficient inventory to meet the needs of this city for three months, and sales will not be restricted in the short term.</p>
<p>Important silk industry people believe that the establishment of the China Silk Company does not affect the private silk industry, because the company's charter includes guidance and incentives for the private silk industry. It is said that the company will recruit some technical personnel from the Sichuan Silk Company.</p>
<p>The Central Bank in Chongqing has reduced the exchange rate for remittances from Chongqing to Shanghai to 45% in order to revitalize the exchange between the two places. Each household can remit 50 to 60 million yuan per week. The Bank of China recently opened remittances to Xiamen and Tianjin, with Xiamen at 70% and Tianjin at 80%. Other exchange rates traded in the market include Shanghai 1060, Guiyang 1006, and Chengdu 992.</p>
<p>After the opening of the Shanghai-Fujian route, Fuzhou, Quanzhou, Xinghua and other places have a strong need for goods from this city. Yesterday, two wooden-hulled sailing vessels sailed to Fujian, loaded with more than 2,000 bags of flour, more than 50 pieces of cotton yarn, and 500 to 600 pieces of bean cake, which were transported to Wei Nei Xuan Tou, which is an important port for Quanzhou and Xinghua. Also, the Da Hua vessel sailed to Ou today, carrying 480 bags of flour, 1,000 pieces of bean cake, and more than 20 pieces of domestic cloth.</p>

<h3>A Glimpse of the Market</h3>
<p>Although the factory prices of Western medicines have not been lowered, there are frequent reports of stockpiles being sold off, causing the market price to decline and not improve.</p>
<p>In the dye market, rumors spread that the Deutz dye, which was sealed up, will be sold at a flat price next spring. The market softened, and merchants were also waiting and seeing, and the market price trended downwards.</p>
<p>Since the industrial raw materials have been ordered, prices have continued to decline, and there have been cases of lawsuits due to orders.</p>
<p>Not many Northern and Southern goods have arrived, and the owners are holding on to them, and prices are rising.</p>
<p>Cigarette sales are less active, and the market is consistently upward. Although some profit-taking occurred in the afternoon, customers from Sichuan were still buying.</p>

<h3>Students of Guanghua University in Chengdu Oppose Renaming to Chenghua University</h3>
<p>Representatives Elected to Petition the Ministry of Education</p>
<p>[Dahua News Agency, Chongqing Airmail] Following the decision by the board of directors of the Chengdu branch of Guanghua University to rename it Chenghua University, students have expressed dissatisfaction. After convening a meeting of all students, they unanimously felt that the school had been established for eight years, enduring hardships. Now, as the Japanese aggressors have surrendered and the nation has been restored, all students rejoice in the imminent resumption of classes. Unexpectedly, the board of directors is gifting the school to local individuals for management. This matter is of great importance and related to their studies. Therefore, they organized a petition group, electing representatives to explain to the board of directors the reasons for retaining the name of Shanghai Guanghua University. However, the board of directors refused, citing that the decision was difficult to reverse, leading to increased indignation among the students. Consequently, they voted to dismiss the board of directors and elected over forty representatives to come to Chongqing to petition the Ministry of Education, hoping for a reasonable resolution.</p>
<h3>Charity Basketball Game for Scholarship Fund: Finals Tonight; China Youth vs. Aocina; Hualian Expected to Defeat Haiqing; Awards Ceremony After the Game</h3>
<p>The Sino-American Charity Basketball Game for Scholarship Fund, jointly organized by this newspaper and Tongde Medical College, has showcased the outstanding skills of Chinese and American athletes for the past two days, with unprecedented excitement in the matches and universal satisfaction among the fans. The final two games will be held tonight at 7:30 PM, still in the former Canidrome Stadium. To show solemnity, Director Gu Yuxiu of the Education Bureau has been specially invited to perform the opening ceremony. After the games, the awards ceremony will be presided over by Chairman Pan Gongzhan and Dean Gu Yuqi of Tongde Medical College. A charity auction of basketballs will also be held, and the military band will perform to add to the excitement. Basketball fans can both enjoy the skills and contribute to the scholarship cause, creating a sensational event. The schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>American Haiqing — Hualian Pharmacy 7:30 PM</p>
<p>Aocina — China Youth 8:30 PM</p>
<p>Hualian's Victory Likely Not a Problem</p>
<p>The first game tonight is Hualian against American Haiqing. Considering Hualian's battle against Aocina, Hualian lost by only three points, which is commendable. Hualian not only possesses intelligence and courage but also demonstrates excellent sportsmanship, leaving a good impression. American Haiqing has plenty of courage, but their floor skills are not yet refined. Hualian should prioritize intelligent play today. Zhen Zhong should continue to focus on providing support, and Xue Chong and Cheng Zhang must have a tacit understanding of running into open spaces to defeat the enemy. As for long-range shots, Hualian should use them sparingly, as Akong is not yet familiar with the basket in that stadium. Why bother trying too much, only to lose possession? If they can do so, Hualian's victory over American Haiqing by more than five points is likely not a problem.</p>
<p>Employ Intelligent Tactics Against Aocina</p>
<p>In the second game, China Youth will face Aocina. The latter's performance in defeating Hualian in the American military league was truly above par. Xu Meng's one-handed shots, hitting the mark with every attempt, are masterpieces rarely seen in recent years, truly the soul of the team and a major concern for China Youth. China Youth possesses the elite players of the Shantou, Xiexing, and Liangxi teams, making for a strong lineup. Facing such a strong opponent, they must seek both offense and defense to find a way to win. The first priority should be to contain Xu Meng's activity, which can be achieved by having Ma Canxi or Liu Fushan sacrifice and mark him closely. With the loss of this main brain, opportunities will arise. The China Youth forwards should heavily utilize the two young players, He Jinsheng and Chen Qingjiang, as they have excellent floor skills and good darting shots, creating threats on both sides. It is not impossible for the American team to suffer a Waterloo. The team rosters are as follows:</p>
<p>(Hualian Team) Li Zhenzhong, Kong Guangyi, Wu Chengzhang, Chen Xuechong, Bo Tuo, Zhang Liangxiong, Zhang Xianlun, Xu Jusheng, Chen Zuoliang, Jin Kun, Yan Youling, Song Hanzhang.</p>
<p>(Haiqing Team) Hu Zi, A'ersun, Jie Kaji, Qu Linwen, Ai Jinxun, Pai Siden, Mo Lings, Lai Wen.</p>
<p>(China Youth Team) Ma Canxi, Zhuo Guorong, Chen Qingjiang, Liu Fushan, He Jingui, Lin Weicong, Zhang Jinxuan, He Lide, Yao Wen, Wang Kuiting.</p>
<p>(Aocina) Xu Meng, Mason, Que Liedun, Hu Sheng, Qu Jingna, Qiong Xun, Bo Ba, Mei Jie, Wheeler.</p>
<h3>Football Referees Association Holds Inaugural Meeting</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Sports Association, in preparation for promoting this season's football matches, invited football referees in the city to a discussion meeting yesterday at the Jing'an Building to facilitate communication. More than twenty people, including renowned football referees and representatives from the Sports Association, attended. It was resolved to establish the Shanghai Football Referees Association, and directors were immediately elected, with Chen Jixiang as the Chairman. Chen Jixiang, Shen Huichun, He Chunhui, Zhang Le, Wu Shouheng, Chen Jiaoliang, and Huang Renyi were elected as directors. The directors then held a meeting, chaired by Chen Jixiang, and resolved to appoint E Sen as the president, and Chen Xiaoliang, Shen Huichun, Zhang Le, and Huang Renyi as members of the scheduling committee, with Shen Huichun as the secretary. It was also resolved to submit an application for registration and record-keeping to the Shanghai Sports Association.</p>
<h3>Results of the Morning Friends Cup</h3>
<p>The results of the two Morning Friends Cup Group A matches yesterday morning are as follows:</p>
<p>Desheng — Feima (Group A) 40 — 26</p>
<p>Xiexing — Zuiyou (Group A) 26 — 10</p>
<h3>Promoting Art Education</h3>
<p>— Lan Zhaotong</p>
<p>During the "May Fourth" Movement, Mr. Cai Yuanpei advocated "Art Education Replacing Religion." Over the past thirty years, China's art education has not seen much success. Specialized schools have few students, and their establishment has not been widespread. Regarding funding and equipment, it is even more pitiful. In primary and secondary schools, art is still a "minor subject," let alone its teaching materials and methods.</p>
<p>For the sake of the overall progress of education, we must raise the issue of art education here because it is an integral part of the entire education system and cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>To promote art education, we should address both fundamental and superficial aspects:</p>
<p>On the fundamental side, it is hoped that the education authorities will quickly use their power to revive art specialty schools nationwide, adjust and enrich them, focusing on teacher training. In teachers colleges, university education departments, and normal schools, art education should be emphasized and excellent art teachers trained. Furthermore, art museums should be established, art exhibitions and art awards should be held, and other substantive initiatives undertaken.</p>
<p>Addressing the fundamental issues may be too slow. Therefore, it is necessary to provide practical guidance on existing primary and secondary school art education, such as: How to supplement the art equipment of existing schools? How to improve current art teaching materials and methods? How to promote further education for current art teachers? The education authorities should quickly plan these aspects.</p>
<p>Finally, we hope that implementing specialist art subject inspectors can improve the status of art education, which is a good way to advance the superficial aspects of art education.</p>
<h3>A Groundbreaking Art Academy: A Visit to the Municipal Drama School</h3>
<p>Since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Shanghai's various construction projects have been actively promoted. The dilapidated educational undertakings are also being successively restored and new developments planned. Director Gu of the Municipal Education Bureau, feeling the importance of dramatic art in social education and noting the lack of dramatic art talent in Shanghai, specially established a Municipal Experimental Drama School to meet the needs of the environment. The former No. 1 Japanese National School on North Sichuan Road, taken over from the Japanese, was allocated as the drama school building. This is a fresh piece of news for the Shanghai drama community.</p>
<p>To understand the internal situation of the school, the reporter took time to visit yesterday afternoon. On the sunny, briskly windy road, with an excited and enthusiastic heart, I walked to the Bund, took a No. 1 tram straight to the Yokohama Bridge on North Sichuan Road, and the eye-catching and brand-new school sign "Shanghai Municipal Experimental Drama School" came into view.</p>
<p>Entering the school gate, in a wide field, several Japanese residents were playing baseball idly. Walking into the office, I was warmly greeted by Mr. Wu Renzhi, the school's academic affairs director. Mr. Wu has a deep understanding of drama and is a famous expert in the Shanghai drama scene. Mr. Wu's ability to preside over academic affairs at the school will greatly contribute to its planning and dedication in the future. After a few words of greeting, the conversation gradually turned to the main topic. Mr. Wu told me in detail everything about the school's preparation and future expansion plans.</p>
<p>The school was prepared in early October by several members of the preparatory committee, including Chen Lin Duan, Gu Zhongyi, Li Jianwu, Huang Zuolin, Zhang Junxiang, Lu Juewu, and Lin Shengshi. After half a month of active work, it was officially established. The Municipal Education Bureau then appointed Mr. Gu Zhongyi as the principal of the school. Mr. Gu is a well-known playwright and director, with more than twenty years of experience in drama research. After taking office as principal, he began enrolling students on the 15th of last month and held entrance examinations on the 28th and 29th. The list of newly admitted students was announced on the 3rd of this month.</p>
<p>At the first meeting under the leadership of Mr. Zhang Zhefan, chairman of the school affairs committee, it was decided to expand the number of classes and continue to recruit new students. The second recruitment examination was announced to be completed on the 9th of this month.</p>
<p>They are now planning to first run a "Part-Time Class" with a training period of two months. After the term expires, the results of the assessment will be classified into the first or second grade respectively. Classes will start in the spring of next year, preparing to first run the Drama Department, Film Department, and Music Drama Department. The Drama Department will be divided into acting and technical groups, which will be held simultaneously; the Film Department will first run the acting group; the Music Drama Department will first run the opera group, and then gradually expand. In addition to basic subjects such as Chinese, English, history, and geography, their courses include history of Chinese and foreign literature, an introduction to art, an introduction to drama, theater awareness, history of Chinese and foreign drama, selected readings of plays, analysis of plays, an introduction to directing techniques, set design, lighting design, costume design, stage design, technical design, film awareness, dance, singing, art, carpentry, electrical engineering, and thread engineering, totaling more than forty types.</p>
<p>Since the school began registration, many young people from the professional sector have come to request part-time elective studies. Now, in order to meet social needs, Principal Gu is preparing to set up elective classes to provide an opportunity for young people in the professional sector who are interested in drama to study. The regulations are currently being planned and drafted. Starting next year, a research class will be prepared as much as possible. Those who enter the research class must have a university degree and specialize in advanced playwriting and directing subjects in order to train playwriting and directing talents.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu Renzhi and I talked for about thirty minutes. I had gained a clear outline of the school's situation. Then, Mr. Wu led me to visit the school building. The houses are spacious and spacious. In addition to ordinary subject classrooms, the equipment for special classrooms for each subject is being planned, such as carpentry rooms, performance rooms, and dance rooms. There are absolutely different facilities from ordinary schools here. Being able to implement them one by one in the future is indeed a groundbreaking art school.</p>
<p>There are still more than 300 Japanese residents living in the school building, preparing to return to their country on standby. The implementation of all the school's detailed plans will be carried out after this group of Japanese residents leaves. After visiting the school for a week, I bid farewell and came back, and I wrote this note, with unlimited prospects for the school. (Yuan)</p>

<h3>Executive Yuan Approves Policy Scope of Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau; Extended to Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui; Hospital Water Tings to Be Returned First; Executive Yuan Orders Return of Occupied Civilian Property</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Executive Yuan Premier Song has approved the expansion of the policy scope of the Shanghai District Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau to include the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. It is reported that Peng Xuepei, Chairman of the Shanghai District Enemy and Puppet Property Review Committee, and Liu Gongyun, Director of the Shanghai District Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau, were summoned to Chongqing for this matter. It was also learned that at 11:00 AM yesterday, a telegram was received from Chongqing by Executive Yuan Deputy Premier Weng, stating that the policy scope of the Shanghai District Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau should extend to the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, which was approved by Premier Song on the 15th. According to Director Peng Xuepei, the committee has begun planning its organization after receiving the telegram.</p>
<p>Thorough Investigation of Material Leaks</p>
<p>The bureau has begun clearing up the water tings of major buildings that were forcibly dismantled by the enemy and puppets in the past, and those belonging to hospitals will be returned as soon as possible. However, the number of these water tings is quite large, and they are scattered in various places in Hongkou, Yangshupu, and Nanshi. It will be quite difficult to return them all to their original owners in a short period of time. As for the leakage of materials currently stored in various warehouses, the bureau has also mobilized Japanese officers and soldiers to be responsible for investigating the detailed list of initial transfers to our side. After obtaining the exact number, it will be possible to investigate.</p>
<p>Utilization Committee Consults Yesterday</p>
<p>The Municipal Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau organized a Utilization Committee to utilize enemy and puppet real estate, warehouses, factories, docks, and indoor furniture. The committee held its first meeting at the bureau at 4:00 PM yesterday, with Huang Boqiao as chairman. First, Shen Mingpan of the Central Trust Bureau reported on the receipt of enemy and puppet real estate, and then the draft organization of the committee was discussed. It was heard that at the meeting, the Executive Yuan's order regarding the return of the people's property forcibly occupied by the enemy and puppets after receipt, except for that belonging to traitors, to the owners for management, and that no organ should forcibly occupy it, was also reported by Director Huang.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Marshall to Arrive in Shanghai Within Days</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] US Ambassador to China Marshall may arrive in Shanghai on the afternoon of the 20th. It is heard that the US Information Office will invite newspaper reporter representatives to the airport to welcome him at noon that day.</p>
<p>Furthermore, US Governor-General of the Philippines McNutt will also come to Shanghai from Manila on the 20th of this month.</p>
<h3>Navigation Hindered by Wind</h3>
<p>After 10:00 AM yesterday, the northwest wind suddenly turned tight. According to shipping industry news, the sea surface was full of white waves, making navigation dangerous. As a result, ship exports yesterday morning were all hindered. The Jiangfeng ship, which runs on the Shanghai-Ningbo line, dropped anchor outside the port at 9:00 AM. When it sailed to the Tongsha sea area, the wind was very strong. For safety reasons, it returned to Shanghai and arrived at Wharf No. 12 at 2:00 PM, where it was docked. The Jiangmin and Jiangtong ships sailed to Tiansheng Port yesterday morning, and the Jianghong sailed to Chongming. Because the ships were small and the waves were big, it was inconvenient to cross the river, and they also returned to Shanghai one after another. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiangshun ship and the Minsheng Company's Minlian ship also left Shanghai yesterday morning and sailed upstream to Hanyi. Because the ships were larger and sailing upstream in the Yangtze River, they were able to support themselves, so they did not return to Shanghai. The Jiangxin ship arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and is scheduled to sail to Hankou on the 21st. The Minzu ship towing the No. 11 iron barge arrived here the day before yesterday, and it also needs to be slightly repaired, and is scheduled to sail to Yichang around the 20th. Huatong Company's Huatong ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday from Chongqing via Nanjing and is scheduled to sail upstream. The British Far East Shipping Agency's Yongsheng ship came to Shanghai from Hong Kong last Saturday and is expected to arrive tomorrow, but due to the strong wind on the sea yesterday, it may be postponed.</p>
<h3>Freeman Arrives in Shanghai: Shanghai Trade Union Welcomes Him</h3>
<p>(Our Dispatch) Mr. Freeman, Labor Counselor of the US State Department, recently came to Shanghai from the United States. Yesterday noon, Zhou Xuexiang of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions hosted Mr. Freeman at the Atlantic Restaurant. Qian Dajun, Wu Shaoshu, He Dekui, Hong Lanyou, Lu Jingshi, and many others attended. During the meeting, Mr. Freeman stated that American people currently consider two major issues: one is the labor problem in the United States itself, and the other is the problem of unity in China. However, the labor problem in the United States urgently needs international assistance, and the problem of unity in China also has a great impact. Mr. Freeman also hopes that the United States and China can cooperate closely and enhance friendship.</p>
<h3>Confucian Society Telegrams to Preserve Sacred Sites</h3>
<p>The Chinese Confucian Society yesterday telegraphed Chairman Chiang, stating that the communist army's invasion of Qufu was shocking. It was said that Qufu is the location of the ancestral temple and cemetery of the Most Holy Teacher, Confucius. If it is infringed upon by the communist army, the sacred sites of thousands of years may be destroyed at once. The thought of this is appalling. Therefore, it is telegraphed to the chairman, requesting that large troops be dispatched to rescue so that the sacred sites can be preserved. This is fortunate for the country.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council to Be Established Soon: Quota Set at Fifty Seats; To Be Announced After Approval by the Executive Yuan</h3>
<p>More than three months have passed since the recovery of this city, and there is still no news of the establishment of the Provisional Council, which represents the public's opinion. The reporter went to the municipal government yesterday to inquire. According to the person in charge, the original quota for the municipal provisional councilors was set at 25. The municipal government, in accordance with regulations, consulted with the municipal party headquarters a month ago and submitted 50 candidates, twice the number, to the Executive Yuan for approval. However, because the city has a larger population, a special request was submitted to increase the quota. Later, approval was obtained to increase it to 50, requiring the submission of 100 candidates. Therefore, the municipal party headquarters consulted again two weeks ago and submitted the list to the Executive Yuan. It will be announced as soon as it is approved.</p>
<h3>Tram Fares to Increase</h3>
<p>(Our Dispatch) According to Mr. Backlock, the person in charge of the Shanghai British Tram Company, the company will soon adjust its routes and fares. Direct trams will run from Jing'an Temple to Hongkou stations, and the entire line will be temporarily divided into five fare stations. First class fares will range from 25 yuan to 65 yuan (each station will increase by 10 yuan). Third class fares will range from 15 yuan to 35 yuan (each station will increase by 5 yuan). The prices of trolleybuses are the same. This application is still under review by the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau. Mr. Backlock also said that starting next month, the salaries of employees will be increased, but new vehicles will be temporarily suspended due to insufficient funds.</p>
<p>The reporter recently inquired with the person in charge of the Huashang Electric Company and learned that the restoration of the company's Nanshi tram is being negotiated by Chairman Du Yuesheng. It may be possible to first lay part of the tracks and start operations early.</p>
<p>Rectifying Order</p>
<p>According to Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, tram stops in the city are unusually crowded, and the order is chaotic. In addition to instructing the British and French tram companies to send people to take care of passengers getting on and off at important stations, the Public Utilities Bureau has also sent letters to the Military Police Corps and the Municipal Police Department to send police and military police to assist in maintaining order.</p>
<h3>High Court Temporary Court to Interrogate Traitors Today</h3>
<p>Regarding the trial of traitor cases, the High Court here has established a temporary court within the Tilanqiao Prison yesterday, specializing in the trial of various traitors. The court is named the Collegial Panel, and is presided over by Court President Liu Yugui and judges Cao Jie, Cao Jun, and Zhu Zonghai. It is scheduled to formally interrogate traitors at 2:00 PM today. The first case to be tried is traitor Chen Riping, who had previously been tried in the High Court.</p>
<p>(Our Newspaper News) British lawyer Gan Deyun, who was previously expelled from British nationality by the British authorities, served as a "Legislative Member of the Puppet Organization." After the outbreak of the Pacific War, he changed to Chinese nationality and published English publications for the Japanese side. Recently, the Mountain Military Authorities arrested him for the crime of traitor and transferred him to the High Court the day before yesterday. At 11:00 AM yesterday, the prisoner was escorted to the High Court Criminal Division in Tilanqiao Shanghai Prison for a preliminary hearing.</p>
<p>(Da Guang News Agency) Ten Philippine nationals attached to the enemy, including orchestra leader Tang Qiaosi Kang Tuolaila, have been arrested by the American army. Evidence is currently being collected, and they will be tried soon.</p>
<h3>Allied Headquarters Deputy Chief of Staff Returns Home</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The Shanghai US Military Headquarters recently announced that Brigadier General Olmsted, Deputy Chief of Staff of the China Theater Allied Headquarters, is scheduled to fly to the United States today. His position will be temporarily filled by Colonel Cade. Mr. Olmsted joined General Wedemeyer's staff this year in January, commanding operations with great merit. Before taking on this position, Mr. Olmsted served as the commander of the Allied G5 team, and planned and coordinated the use of the Hump air transport, the Stilwell Road, and the implementation of the Lend-Lease Act. His assistance to General Wedemeyer extended beyond military matters to include military supply, and political and economic aspects, especially in directing Allied activities behind enemy lines. The G5 team flew to various Allied concentration camps at the end of the war to provide assistance and aid to prisoners of war, much of which was based on Mr. Olmsted's plans. After returning to the United States, Mr. Olmsted will be stationed at the Allied Military Department in Washington, assisting in the demobilization of the Allied forces. However, Mr. Olmsted himself has expressed a desire to retire early and engage in business.</p>
<h3>United Press Reporter Describes the Trends of Japanese Residents in Shanghai</h3>
<p>A Portion Actually Resists Democracy</p>
<p>According to a report from the United Press in this city: The re-education movement for Japanese residents in Shanghai has been underway for nearly two months and is now facing serious secret resistance. The leniency of the Chinese authorities initially moved the Japanese to deep gratitude, but this has gradually faded. It is said that a small number of powerful Japanese are engaging in various secret activities to resist the Chinese authorities' efforts to instill democratic thought into the minds of the 90,000 Japanese concentrated in northern Shanghai. Another small portion of Japanese openly advocates abolishing the emperor system and fervently supports MacArthur's plan to control Japan. However, these Japanese are too few in number to influence Japanese society, as the majority are psychologically inclined to accept militarist ideology. According to well-informed sources, the Japanese engaged in secret resistance can be divided into four factions, all of whom are vying for leadership in the Japanese community and are unwilling to yield to each other. It is said that the extreme nationalist faction among the Japanese has formed a commando team, which includes many former members of the Japanese military police.</p>
<h3>British Ships Loaded with Goods Shipped to Hong Kong and Shanghai; British Merchants Eager to Resume Business</h3>
<p>British Information Service, London, 17th: After a four-year hiatus, Britain has resumed shipping goods to China by sea. Two ships bound directly for Shanghai are being readied for departure. Another two or three ships are en route to Hong Kong. However, the tonnage of British ships and the quantity of goods are still very limited. One of the ships arriving in Shanghai is newly completed and specifically designed for navigation in the Far East seas. However, it is not yet possible to establish a precise shipping schedule between China and Britain. This is only a temporary phenomenon, and with a little more time, more ships will be loaded with industrial products, and a shipping schedule will be established. The goods and equipment currently being shipped to China are urgently needed by British trading companies in Shanghai to resume business, and London also recognizes clear evidence that China is buying machinery from Britain again. In the past few weeks, large quantities of cotton spinning machines and wool spinning machines have been ordered. China is also inquiring about machinery, automobiles, electrical machinery, steel plates, and other products from Britain. Britain is currently busy manufacturing materials needed by peacetime industries.</p>
<h3>Unlawful Japanese Prisoners Arrested</h3>
<p>(Our Newspaper News) According to reporter investigations, some Japanese prisoners of war have been conducting underground activities. It is said that the person in charge is a Japanese major general. The day before yesterday, our single-police authorities, acting on a report, ordered the authorities to go to a certain place to destroy an organization. All the rioters were arrested, and a light machine gun, pistol bullets, magazines, and other items were seized.</p>
<h3>German Exiles Communicate with Relatives and Friends</h3>
<p>According to post office sources: The Directorate General of Posts of the Ministry of Communications has, at the request of the British military occupation zone authorities in Germany, permitted German expatriates in China to communicate with their relatives and friends in the British military occupation zone in that country. However, only one letter is allowed per person per month, and it must be marked "German Exile" letter.</p>
<h3>Municipal Bureau of Public Works Repairs Roads and Removes Iron Gates</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] According to statistics from the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, the total length of roads in this city is more than 1,800 li, equivalent to three times the distance from Shanghai to Nanjing. The Bureau of Public Works is currently stepping up road repairs. Roads that will soon be completed include the City Center Road, Jungong Road, Songhu Road, Qimei Road, and East Tiyu Road. Roads that are currently under repair in the urban area include Yuyuan Road, Xinzha Road, Linsen Road, South Chengdu Road, and Jiangsu Road.</p>
<p>In addition, iron gates at the border between the Chinese area and the French Concession will also be removed in the near future.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Branch of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Actively Distributes Relief Goods; Charity Market to Open for Public Sale for Five Days Starting on the 20th</h3>
<p>Ten relief ships sailing from the United States to China have arrived in Shanghai. It is expected that two more ships will arrive here within one or two days. The relief goods carried by the above ships, after being received by the Shanghai Office of the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, have been allocated and distributed by the Shanghai Branch, including 60,000 tons of flour, 246 tons of military rations, 3,000 packages of used clothing, and medicines including 200 bottles of penicillin and DDT insecticide.</p>
<p>Relief to Chinese and Foreign Refugees Separately</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the Shanghai Branch: In addition to the Chinese refugees, there are also 15,000 Jewish refugees, 2,000 White Russian refugees, and about 4-500 Italian sailors staying in Shanghai; in addition, there are some refugees from Central European countries. The relief goods distributed by the branch, with regard to Chinese refugees, are distributed by various charitable organizations and refugee shelters. For Jewish refugees, they are distributed by the United Relief Association, which is organized by the Jews in Shanghai. For White Russian refugees, they are distributed by the White Russian Association. The Italian sailors and refugees from Central European countries also have specialized organizations to apply for and receive relief goods from the Relief Branch, which are then distributed separately. The first batch of flour issued by the branch is of extremely large quantities, and the second batch of flour has also been decided to be issued within a short period of time. 8,000 boxes of military rations have been distributed to various charitable organizations and Jewish associations in the past few days.</p>
<p>Donated Used Clothing Varies in Type</p>
<p>As for the 3,000 packages of relief used clothing shipped from the United States, they were only unloaded from the ship last Saturday. Among them, there are extremely good suits and coats, as well as extremely worn shirts and skirts, and various scattered items such as socks, leather shoes, and even umbrellas. The clothing in each package of used clothing varies in type. This is because people from all over the United States voluntarily donate all their used clothing to refugees in China, so the clothes they donate are quite inconsistent. As the weather is turning cold, the Shanghai Branch has decided to distribute the above used clothing to the compatriots and refugees of various countries within days to protect them from the cold. It is said that they will also be slightly sorted out so that they can be distributed to meet the needs of the various refugees.</p>
<p>Penicillin is Carefully Claimed and Used</p>
<p>Regarding medicines, the Shanghai Branch has received 200 bottles of penicillin (100,000 units per bottle), which have been handed over to Renji, Hongren, Guangci, Red Tenth First, Municipal Second, Ximen Women and Children, Shanghai Children, and Gongji and other nine hospitals, and designated doctors are responsible for signing for them. The penicillin can only be injected if the patient must be treated with penicillin and drugs such as salvarsan have been used without effect. It is also stipulated that free treatment is only given to those who have been investigated and are indeed destitute. Otherwise, the fees are divided into three grades according to the patient's economic strength.</p>
<p>[Another News] When the materials loaded on the relief ship arriving in Shanghai are counted, there are often shortages. The reason is that the American factory fails to deliver the goods in time, and the relief ship cannot be postponed, resulting in inconsistencies with the original manifest. It is said that the missing materials will be transported to Shanghai for replenishment.</p>
<p>Charity Market Public Sale Items</p>
<p>The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and the Shanghai Branch of the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration will jointly hold a charity market from the 20th to the 24th of this month at the original site of the former New Great Bank (corner of Guizhou Road and Tianjin Road, behind the New World Company, obtained for free). There are four types of items for public sale: (1) 10,000 bags of flour, each bag weighing 44 market catties (including the bag), 1,900 yuan, limited to two bags per person. (2) Pineapple, each can weighing one pound, 500 yuan, limited to four cans per person, a total of 648 pieces, each piece 24 cans, a total of 15,452 cans. (3) Pears, each can weighing six pounds and ten ounces, 2,500 yuan, limited to one can per person, a total of 498 pieces, each piece 6 cans, a total of 2,988 cans.

Huang Xuanping, Hu Guoliang, Xue Zhiliang, Yao Junzhi, and Liu Nianli were specially appointed as honorary members of the Su Bei Committee for the public sale of the above items.</p>
<h3>Feng Youzhen and Yu Wen Hosted the Press Yesterday</h3>
<p>Feng Youzhen, representative of the Central Propaganda Department stationed in Shanghai, and Yu Wen, special envoy of the Central Cultural Movement Committee stationed in Shanghai, jointly held a tea party at the Kang Le Restaurant at 3:00 PM yesterday to entertain the press in this city.</p>
<p>Mr. Feng's Report</p>
<p>Mr. Feng stood up to report, stating briefly: The Central Propaganda Department, as the National Government's return to the capital still requires some time, in order to maintain close contact with the Shanghai press and publishing circles, has specially appointed me as the representative stationed in Shanghai. I will do my best to serve the press in order to assist in the development of the Shanghai news industry. Currently, the Shanghai press has two major important issues: one is the paper shortage issue, and the other is the organizational issue of the press. Regarding the former, the Central Propaganda Department has already consulted with the headquarters of General MacArthur in Tokyo to purchase the newsprint stored in Japan and try to ship it to Shanghai to provide relief. It has also requested the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to purchase paper from Canada. Please notify me of the amount of paper that each newspaper needs to purchase, and I will forward it on your behalf to facilitate allocation. Regarding the organizational issue of the press, before the war, there were two groups in this city: the Newspaper Association and the Reporter Association. The former was established by the newspapers to discuss business contacts, and the latter was organized by colleagues in the press. The persons in charge of the management departments of each newspaper are currently preparing to form a Newspaper Industry Association and are applying for registration with the Social Affairs Bureau. Several executive and supervisory committee members of the former Reporter Association in Shanghai have also submitted a request to the Social Affairs Bureau for approval to restore the organization of the Reporter Association and organize a reorganization committee to be responsible for preparations, which has been approved by the Social Affairs Bureau. Once the candidates for the reorganization committee are decided, preparatory work can begin. I hope that colleagues in the press will work together to expedite its establishment.</p>
<p>Mr. Yu's Speech</p>
<p>Mr. Yu stated briefly that the Central Cultural Movement Committee has decided to set up special envoys in ten major cities, including Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Wuhan, in order to promote the cultural construction movement in the recovered areas. I have been appointed to work in Shanghai, and I hope that colleagues in the cultural and press circles will give me a lot of assistance. In order to reward cultural workers for their hard work and struggle during the Anti-Japanese War, the Central Cultural Movement Committee has recently drafted "Measures for Cultural Figures to Receive Medals," which will be implemented after being submitted to the Central Government for approval. Anyone who meets one of the four qualifications for receiving a medal as stipulated in the measures can apply for the medal. After the speech, the attending press raised opinions on applying to the Central Government for the allocation of official exchange rates to purchase art books from Europe and the United States, relieving the paper shortage, and improving the treatment of reporters. Mr. Feng promised to forward the opinions and consider them appropriately.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Branch of the Literary Association Established Yesterday; Demands Freedom of Speech and Exposes Literary Figures Who Supported the Enemy</h3>

<h3>Special Envoy Niu Yongjian Broadcasts: A New Style for Greater Shanghai; Taking Diligence and Steadfastness as the Center</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Broadcasting Station of the Central Broadcasting Affairs Administration specially invited Mr. Niu Yongjian, the central special envoy for consolation of the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and the two cities of Nanjing and Shanghai, to give a lecture at the station at 7:45 PM yesterday (17th). The topic was "A New Style for Greater Shanghai," and the full text of the lecture is as follows:</p>
<p>Listeners, I am very honored to be invited by the Shanghai Broadcasting Station today to speak to you. However, what I want to say was all said by Mr. Ye Chucang the day before yesterday, and there are no new ideas to add. It is truly shameful to take some ordinary words, so-called platitudes, to respond to the invitation.</p>
<p>This time we came to Shanghai, following Chairman Chiang's instructions, we are to listen more to the people's words and actively seek</p>
<p>Civil Suffering</p>
<p>Communicate the Central Government's good intentions and hope that the people will have a deep understanding of the Central Government's painstaking efforts in administration, and bring the situation of civil suffering back to the Central Government for consideration, so that administrative improvements can be made and the Central Government and local areas can be strongly united, working hard and forging ahead on the road to building the country, in order to achieve the goal of building a prosperous, strong, and happy new China.</p>
<p>I remember Mr. Chu Cang said the day before yesterday that Shanghai is the gateway for China's transportation with the world, and its politics, economy, culture, education, society, and everything else not only have a great impact on China, but also affect the whole world. Therefore, Shanghai must become a model area, and we must</p>
<p>Everyone Works Hard</p>
<p>In order to live up to our responsibility as Shanghainese. These words really moved us very much. I am a Shanghainese, so I am willing to follow the Shanghai masses to work together to fulfill my due responsibility.</p>
<p>The current Shanghai, thanks to the joint efforts of the Central Government, the Municipal Government, and people from all walks of life, although it has only been a little over three months since its restoration, it has made considerable progress, which we admire. However, after the pain, the losses caused by the war and the plunder by the enemy and puppets are still</p>
<p>Scars Everywhere</p>
<p>The current problems are numerous, such as the high prices, the difficulties in people's lives, the destruction of factories, or being taken over and not yet resuming work, resulting in the unemployment of workers, the lack of materials, and the need for urgent management of education, economy, and industry and commerce. Also, it is unavoidable that the behavior of a few personnel is not up to par, or the considerations are not complete, or the handling is improper, leaving room for criticism, which is the inevitable fact after eight years of heavy destruction by the enemy and puppets. The Municipal Government is observing public sentiment and rectifying matters. After several days of investigation and observation, we have also learned a little about the outline. Now that we are working hard to build a democratic new China, we are very willing for everyone to</p>
<p>Speak Frankly and Without Reservation</p>
<p>As long as it is well-intentioned and constructive. Our coming this time is to represent Chairman Chiang in seeking public opinion, can everyone tell the truth? This is the only key to building a greater Shanghai. The past ills of various public and private undertakings in China are jealousy and whitewashing. Therefore, many people do not tell the truth and do not seek practical results. Because they do not seek truth or practical results, the impact extends to many important things concerning the nation and the country, and there are many things that only talk about the surface and never make actual progress. Therefore, things are not as good as others, which is the worst thing, and we must correct it. Everyone come to</p>
<p>Tell the Truth</p>
<p>In order to establish a new style. Telling the truth is the beginning of our new style. All other virtues and good deeds start from this. Because we can tell the truth, we can seek perfection, diligence, and steadfast practice, so we will go one step further, and we will offer the four words of diligence, steadfastness, and reward to everyone. This is the practical training that Chairman Chiang has always shown, and we must thoroughly follow it. Industry is diligent, so practical work is the fundamental work of excellence. If we can be diligent, then we can be excellent. People who can be active in production work can</p>
<p>Increase Production</p>
<p>Enrich materials. In the small sense, it can enrich personal enjoyment, and in the large sense, it can supply the needs of society and the country, fundamentally stabilizing prices and stabilizing people's livelihoods. In this environment, there will naturally be no corrupt or illegal behaviors. The direct and indirect effects of this diligence are truly limitless. If we can use the word diligence in learning, then we will be tireless, specialize in studying, and strive for excellence. The atomic bomb was created by diligence, so what are we afraid of not being able to do? So, with</p>
<p>Diligence and Steadfastness</p>
<p>Four words, that is a priceless treasure, inexhaustible. Building Greater Shanghai is our current great cause. At this time, when there is a lack of human and material resources, there are certainly many difficulties. However, the new style of diligence and steadfastness is like a panacea. Therefore, the progress of our work and the success of our cause can be as easy as turning a hand. Yongjian has been away from Shanghai for eight years because of his dedication to the Anti-Japanese War. This time, when I come to Shanghai to visit my fellow villagers, I have nothing to give as a gift. I would like to offer these four words of diligence and steadfastness as a gift to the elders, brothers, sisters, and sisters who have been reunited after a long separation, and to express my willingness to work together to help complete the construction of Greater Shanghai.</p>
<h3>The Weather Changed - An Introduction to the Xujiahui Observatory</h3>
<p>The weather changed! The night before, everyone felt warm, but unexpectedly, after a night of drizzle, it suddenly became extremely cold yesterday morning. The north wind howled all day long, and the sky was filled with dust. People standing in front of the China United Building on Avenue Édouard VII, waiting for the No. 22 red bus, would have been blown over by the strong wind if they hadn't braced their legs. During the day, the reporter personally witnessed five pedestrians chasing after their hats in the strong wind. Rickshaws parked by the roadside were blown over, and several bamboo fences collapsed in the Avenue Joffre and Route Ferguson area. The small creek in Xujiahui was also half frozen, and not a single pedestrian on the streets of Shanghai was not stamping their feet from the cold!</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, the temperature was still in the fifties (Fahrenheit), but yesterday it plummeted to below freezing.</p>
<p>It was during this sudden change in climate that the reporter braved the needle-sharp wind and rushed to Xujiahui to visit the nationally renowned observatory.</p>
<p>More than Seventy Years of History</p>
<p>Those who care about the history of Chinese science should remember that in the 16th and 17th centuries, Matteo Ricci and Johann Adam Schall von Bell came from Europe to the Chinese court to serve as great scientists in the "Imperial Astronomical Bureau." The names of these two should be immortalized in Chinese history forever, but they only pioneered the trend; it was not until 1873 that the Jesuit Catholics officially laid the foundation for formal scientific research in China – they established universities, middle schools, orphanages, and vocational schools near Xujiahui, and the most valuable in science was the Xujiahui Observatory.</p>
<p>The observatory is located opposite the famous Catholic Church. During the Anti-Japanese War, the Japanese did not interfere because it was considered "private property" belonging to the church, so it was not disturbed. After the victory, it was rumored that the military wanted to occupy it, but after explanation, they withdrew. To this day, the wooden sign at the gate still reads, "Private Property, No Visitors."</p>
<p>Inside the gate is a garden, and beautiful roses dance wildly in the wind. In the middle of the garden are more than a dozen steps, and above them is the observatory's office. Walking through the heavy bronze doors, one feels a sense of silence. Outside, the cold wind howls wildly, but inside, it is so quiet that one can only hear the "tick-tock" of the clock pendulum.</p>
<p>Meeting Father Long Xiangqi</p>
<p>The observatory's reception room is decorated very elegantly, with luxurious cushions on the rosewood kang, and several grand master chairs scattered in the center of the hall. Here, the reporter met Father Ernest Cherzi, the person in charge of the observatory. Father Long is Italian, but he also has a Chinese name, called "Guiqing." His titles are: "Director of Meteorology and Seismology, without salary, at the Xujiahui Observatory, Member of the International Meteorological Society, Member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, Member of the International Radio Research Association." He has been in China for twenty-six years. Father Long and Vice President Weng (Yongyi) and Mr. Ding Wenjiang are old friends. The observatory is now entrusted by the highest government authorities and Vice President Weng to handle national meteorological observations and other related canine literature work. The weather reports published daily by the semaphore on the Bund are all supplied by the Xujiahui Observatory.</p>
<p>Considering the importance of the work of the Xujiahui Observatory and Father Long's position in the international scientific community, people would generally assume that he must have many assistants. But in fact, he only has one assistant! Every morning at 5:30, he gets up to listen to weather reports from various places by radio. This radio reception work is extremely difficult. The strength of the signal is unstable, there is a lot of interference, and the isolation is not clear. At first, he asked assistants for help, but they could not hear clearly, making things worse, so he simply did it himself. The reporter asked him, "Isn't that too tiring?" But the lean and agile Father Long simply stroked his gray-black hair and said, "This is a pleasure."</p>
<p>Achievements of Arduous Work</p>
<p>Stepping into the observatory's library, one suddenly feels insignificant. The walls are covered with bookshelves, stacked all the way to the ceiling. Father Long took out a thick "East Asian Meteorological Map" that was four feet long and three feet wide. This is the result of his recent work, which took more than two years and was published in 1944. It includes hundreds of different maps and tables, and it is truly an unprecedented attempt in the Far East. For agriculture, transportation, water conservancy, aviation, hydropower engineering, sanitation, and chemical engineering—the value of this map is unparalleled. Recently, after five years of research, he invented a new temperature table that can be used to predict the approximate climate of a certain day one or two months in advance using a very simple method. He knew about this cold snap two months ago. He predicted that there would be a cold snap one or two days after Christmas. He has already written a paper on this discovery and plans to send it to the United States for publication.</p>
<p>During this war, the Xujiahui Observatory had already applied its principles to meteorological research four years before the outbreak of the Pacific War, which was widely used in air transport. Recently, many people from the Allied forces who came to visit expressed great surprise!</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Xujiahui Observatory has cultivated more than fifty meteorological talents, who are now scattered in Qingdao, Beiping, and other places. With the current development of the aviation industry, China is in need of a large number of astronomy and meteorological personnel. How many young people are willing to learn from this hard-working and meritorious priest, working silently and serving the country? The reporter cannot help but feel boundless respect for this scholar who has worked diligently for nearly thirty years. (Pingzhai)</p>
<p>For seventy years, the Xujiahui Observatory has been doing continuous practical work in science. Under the leadership of Father Long, it communicates with observatories around the world every day, reporting news. In particular, weather reports have contributed the most to navigation. This is the appearance of the Xujiahui Observatory.</p>
<h3>Cold Wave Strikes Shanghai, Temperature Plummets</h3>
<p>At dawn yesterday, a strong north wind howled in the city, and the climate suddenly turned frigid. Thin ice began to form in the ditches, and the wind was so strong all day that many window panes were shattered. This cold wave is likely to linger today, and the severe cold is expected to continue.</p>
<p>A powerful Siberian anticyclone has concentrated over Mongolia and has invaded North China and this city.</p>
<p>Weather forecast: Over the Yellow Sea, clear and cold, with fog, turning extremely cold, northwest gale turning north, weakening by tomorrow night. Over this city: cloudy, with fog, colder, strong northwest wind turning north, gradually weakening. Over the East Sea: cloudy to overcast, rain, northwest gale turning northeast. Over the East Sea: extremely strong northeast wind around the Taiwan Strait.</p>

<h3>American Soldiers in Song</h3>
<p>— Zhang Deqian</p>
<p>The bustling districts of Shanghai are filled with American warriors coming and going. They wear different uniforms, come from different regions. Some are pilgrims who have traversed the Ledo Road, some are explorers who have flown over the Himalayas, and some are Columbuses who have sailed across the Pacific. They have just left behind the soil of the Savage Mountain cliffs, the fog over the Jialing River, and the wind from the corners of Okinawa Island, and suddenly tumbled into the worldly affairs of this eastern metropolis.</p>
<p>Shanghai, the city where Eastern and Western cultures meet, feels very familiar to the American soldiers who come from inland China, as if they have returned to their homeland, at least curing half of their homesickness, while those who come from overseas find it very novel and magnificent—only one thing makes those unfamiliar guests feel regretful, that is, after searching all over this overpopulated city, they have not found the braids and bound feet that they idealize as symbols of Chinese culture.</p>
<p>Those who had been to China before the war, even if it was only for three or two days, were immediately dubbed China experts, and they honestly and unceremoniously regarded themselves as experienced guides, leading a group of younger brothers to hunt for curiosities in Chinese shops. As a result, the old stock in the shroud shops was snapped up, and the outdated water pipes that had long been neglected in a corner immediately became ten times more valuable, becoming treasures in the eyes of foreigners. After all, if they didn't bring some longevity-related items home, what would they use to show off to the priests in their parishes and their long-separated loved ones, to make them believe in the exotic tales they told?</p>
<p>Tommy is going back to his country tomorrow, and in his happy mood, some melancholy is inevitably mixed in—he is a little reluctant to part with the charming White Russian Paulina. In the bar exuding an American atmosphere, he and she drink the last glass of wine together. Paulina lovingly takes out a CRB, signs her name, and hands it to Tommy, saying, "Please don't forget this little souvenir brought back from China." Look, it's a large bill of ten thousand yuan! Tommy shyly takes out a twenty-dollar (how ashamed) American bill, also signs his name, and hands it to her, saying, "Please keep it too." Hopefully she can keep it!</p>
<p>Joe is a foodie. He has already learned to play with chopsticks as well as the Chinese, and can distinguish the characteristics of Cantonese cuisine and Sichuan cuisine. He knows that even in San Francisco, New Orleans, or even New York, he can't necessarily eat as much to his liking as in Shanghai. On the eve of his departure from Shanghai, he is going to have a hearty meal.</p>
<p>The unlucky one is Bob. Not only can he not bring some oriental souvenirs home, but even the Parker pen and Hamilton watch he brought from his hometown have fallen into the hands of stateless gold-digging girls. Strolling on Nanjing Road in the cold night, having thrown the last firecracker, recalling the heroic spirit of the Battle of Leyte Gulf and the boldness when he first arrived in Shanghai, reflected in the loneliness at this moment, he couldn't help but feel a myriad of emotions. Feeling his pockets, he still has a CRB of five thousand yuan. He uses it to exchange for a Chinese evening newspaper (that's right, this is also a very valuable souvenir); he then happily strides (he doesn't have the money to take the tricycle he likes) towards the Bund.</p>
<p>American soldiers come and go in droves. They quietly leave this fantastical and chaotic eastern city, each with different emotions of joy and sorrow, and return to the embrace of their motherland. Let us bless these innocent big children to always maintain their vigor, and wish them a safe journey!</p>
<p>In the fall of 1943, Peng De was subjected to an absentee indictment in the United States. In May of this year, he was captured by the militia in northern Italy. He was not escorted back to the country from Italy until November 18 of the same year; he also left behind a concubine, two sons, and an 86-year-old mother in Italy. This is the first case of treason leaked via radio waves in the United States. When he was sent to the prison in the American capital, he was still saying: "In the age of radio, if there is no freedom of speech on the radio... then I will die for an idea...".</p>

<h3>Eternally Discriminated Against Black People</h3>
<p>— Shen Yin</p>
<p>In the democratic country of the United States, black people have always been discriminated against. During this war, they went on expeditions to various parts of the United Kingdom and built a lot of special achievements, but discrimination is still unavoidable. Racial concepts are indeed difficult to eliminate.</p>
<p>As soon as the black troops arrived in Wales, the mayor of Cardiff discussed with the American military officer: What methods should be used to "prevent" young girls from mingling with the black troops? The authorities do not blame the black people. They hate that the girls should not be with the black people, and the black people naturally feel discriminated against when the authorities simply do not allow the girls to be with them.</p>
<p>The attitude of the British towards black people also varies from place to place. Generally, in small towns where there are no American soldiers stationed, the residents are much more affectionate. They are as indifferent to the black troops as they are to other troops, and gradually become familiar. Sometimes they invite black people to play in their homes, and the girls watch movies, dance, and joke with them. There are very few marriages, according to the American military authorities, there is only one case, but there have been a number of mixed-race illegitimate children discovered.</p>
<p>In some places, the residents and black people have a harmonious relationship because of the promotion of the Red Cross. As soon as the black troops arrive in a certain place, the Red Cross asks the local residents to cooperate and entertain the black people. The housewives often invite black people to dinner, and the Red Cross club also has dances, where American black people are all entertained, but most of the dancing is done by black people.</p>
<p>In Cambridge, there are both black people and American soldiers, and the attitude of the local residents looks somewhat different to the black people. Black people often quarrel. When they take white girls walking down the street, the police often stop them and advise them to go back. After the intervention of the Red Cross staff, these things no longer happen, but women who are with black people are often suspected of being prostitutes. In order to avoid misunderstandings and preserve their reputation, good women are not very dare to approach black soldiers after this.</p>
<p>In Ipswich, where the Eighth Air Force is gathered, dance halls often rotate every other day to entertain white people and black people. The black people say that this increases discrimination even more. Because when black people dance, there are several white soldiers watching next to them, originally they want to see clearly who is dancing with the black people, so that they can ignore those girls next time. White people also insist that girls who are with black people can be divided into two categories, one is those who have a fetish for black people, and the other is "semi-professional" prostitutes.</p>
<p>According to black soldiers stationed in London, the discrimination against black people by the locals is extremely deep. In hotels, they often charge higher prices when they encounter black people. Restaurants have empty seats, but when they see black people, they say they are full. Some public places close their doors to reject guests a little later. Some hotels leave a mark once black people have been there, and the next time they use that name to book a room over the phone, they will never be able to book it.</p>
<p>Some black people say that the discrimination they suffer in the United Kingdom is not as deep as they suffer in the United States. In the United States, they often have a sense of inferiority, but in the United Kingdom, they are treated equally. They may be disappointed when they return to the United States in the future, but they will no longer feel inferior. But some black people say that the British people's discrimination against them is only increasing day by day, mainly due to the influence of the American soldiers. Some discrimination can be avoided in the southern United States, but in the United Kingdom, it is simply unbearable.</p>

<h3>Vicissitudes</h3>
<p>— Ke Ding𥂜</p>
<p>Recently, I rummaged through my old suitcase and found several old five-yuan and ten-yuan legal tender notes that had been carefully stored at the bottom of the suitcase. Because I had picked out new ones to collect at the time, they are still crisp, the patterns are gorgeous, and the printing is clear.</p>
<p>These ten-yuan legal tender notes could buy a stone of first-class white rice eight years ago. But today, three months after the victory eight years later, a ten-yuan legal tender note can only buy a thin pancake. Eight years ago, a stone of first-class white rice was enough for a family of five to eat for more than a month; but today, a thin pancake, I don't know which corner of the hungry stomach it can be placed in!</p>
<p>Therefore, I only have the idea of appreciating these few different five-yuan and ten-yuan legal tender notes that have been carefully stored for a long time, and I don't have the courage to use them. Fortunately, there is a large mirror frame, so I put it on black card stock, put it in the large mirror frame, and titled it "Vicissitudes" as an ornament for my Shanghai residence.</p>
<p>Book Review</p>
<h3>Life Is Ours</h3>
<p>— Yu Xin'en</p>
<p>Mr. Liu Renjie's three-act tragedy "Life Is Ours" profoundly depicts the patriotic people who sacrificed for justice in this Anti-Japanese War, under the double iron hoofs of the enemy and traitors, bravely moving forward, passionately and resolutely, each completing their indelible great mission in this turbulent era. However, these patriots did not receive medals, nor did they receive high positions or titles, but they exchanged today's freedom and peace from the lives of these thousands of unnamed heroes.</p>
<p>Dr. Jiang, and his only son, Han, Dean Mendelssohn, Lin Yin, and Old Liu are all good people in the occupied areas, as the author said: "This world cannot tolerate good people." The author, with his professional relationship and literary talent, depicts Dr. Jiang and these characters in the play vividly; their patriotism and their sacrifices, under the extremely dangerous and difficult circumstances, their merits are no less than those of the group who received medals and high positions, but they are neglected in today's world.</p>
<p>The first act tells that Dr. Jiang, with the duty of a doctor, saves the life of Zhao, the president of the Great Traitor Association, who kills people without bloodshed, under a contradictory mentality. In the second act, Dr. Jiang and his only son, Han, are captured by President Zhao and subjected to torture and great humiliation for their patriotism. In the third act, the good people finally sacrifice at the hands of the wicked. Act by act, the emotions intensify, showing a clear contrast between good and evil, life and death, and the contradiction between killing and saving people. It is a singable and tearful, regrettable and sighable drama that fits the era and deserves our attention.</p>

<h3>New "Iron Lung"</h3>
<p>— Bai Hua</p>
<p>The deeds of the iron lung were sensational before the war. With the progress of science and industry in recent years, a new "iron lung" has been introduced. The new iron lung is made of plastic, which is much lighter and more compact than the heavy and bulky steel machine.</p>
<p>The new plastic iron lung helps paralyzed patients breathe and promotes blood circulation in patients with heart disease, just as effectively as the heavy iron lung.</p>

<h3>The Enemy (19)</h3>
<p>— Pearl S. Buck, translated by Zhu Qi</p>
<p>But Sadao was rewarded that night when he searched for the little black dot in the sea at dusk. There was no flash of light in the twilight. The island was deserted. His prisoner was gone—doubtless safe. For he had warned him that he should wait only for a Korean fishing boat.</p>
<p>He stood for a moment on the veranda, gazing out to the sea from whence the young man had come that other night. And into his mind, though without reason, there came other white faces he had known—the professor at whose house he had met Hana, a dull man, and his wife had been a silly talking woman, in spite of her wish to be kind. He remembered his old anatomy teacher, who had been so insistent on mercy with the knife, and then he remembered the face of his fat and slatternly landlady. He had had great difficulty in finding a place to live in America because he was a Japanese. The Americans were full of prejudice and it had been bitter to live in it, knowing himself their superior. How he had despised the ignorant and dirty old woman who had at last consented to house him in her miserable home! He had once tried to be grateful to her because she had in his last year nursed him through influenza, but it had been difficult, for she was no less repulsive to him even in her kindness. Now he remembered the youthful, haggard face of his prisoner—white and repulsive.</p>
<p>Strange, he thought, strange that I could have killed him?</p>

<h3>The Number One Cultural "American Traitor"</h3>
<p>— Ling Dai</p>
<p>At the time when the elder Zhitang was arrested in Beiping as a traitor, news also came from the United States that the number one cultural "American traitor" had been arrested and escorted to a prison in Washington, D.C.; this was Ezra Pound, formerly renowned in American literary circles as a poet. Pound was a famous poet who had always lived in Europe. His poems had been published in top-tier American literary journals. He was a stalwart of the American surrealist movement and had proposed the revolutionary "Image Movement" in poetry. From the 1920s to the 1930s, his status was more or less comparable to that of T. S. Eliot, and he was an idol for many young poets.</p>
<p>Pound was originally born in the mining district of Idaho, in the western United States, and was the son of a prospector. He felt that the American environment was not suitable for literary creation and that his talents could not be appreciated. Therefore, after a short period of teaching at a university in the central United States, he left the United States in 1908, lived in London for a while, then in Paris, and finally moved to the "Corner of the Azure Sea" in northern Italy, spending his life as a resident alien under the leisurely and antique Mediterranean coast with its azure southern skies. During this time, apart from his poems being published in American magazines, he rarely had the opportunity to return to the United States. In 1936, he discovered Mussolini's "greatness"; in the same year, he also wrote poems praising the leaders of the Nazi party as heirs to the American democratic tradition. In 1939, he returned to the United States and openly declared that fascist Italy was "more free than anywhere in the West."</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the European war, he could not receive royalties from Britain and the United States, so he appeared on the "Axis" radio waves. After the Pearl Harbor incident, he said to the American people on the radio: "The crime of participating in the war caused by the president's abnormal nerves is illegal." He also said to the American people: "No matter how you think you are under the leadership of Roosevelt or Churchill, in reality Hitler and Mussolini are your leaders."

<h3>Optimistic View of Lung Disease (Part 1)</h3>
<p>Chinese Health Association</p>
<p>Editor's Note: In recent years, the number of patients with lung disease has been increasing daily, and young men and women are also easily infected. Confined to bed for years, the suffering is profound. This is greatly related to the health of the nation. In view of this, this column has specially invited specialized physicians from the Chinese Health Association to write a lecture on anti-tuberculosis, approximately three thousand words, to be published in four installments. We hope that patients will pay attention.</p>
<p>(1) To Drift Along and Be Content with the Status Quo is a Suicidal Policy for Lung Disease</p>
<p>People in cities often unconsciously suffer from lung disease, but they think their lungs are very healthy. They do not think about how to determine whether their lungs are indeed healthy, but allow the disease to develop secretly. Also, because the initial symptoms are very mild, they often do not notice them and pay no attention. It is not until the disease has progressed deeply that they become anxious, flustered, and blame others, without knowing that they have missed the opportunity for early and appropriate treatment. This is due to their own complacency. Such a trend toward a suicidal policy in unawareness is bound to lead to tragic results.</p>
<p>(2) There is No Specific Medicine for Pulmonary Tuberculosis</p>
<p>If there were a specific medicine for lung disease like 606 for syphilis or quinine for malaria, then the reduction of tuberculosis would be obvious, and we would promote it without hesitation. There is no reason to oppose the use of medicine to treat lung disease. However, Chinese people are dominated by two mentalities: a desire to save trouble and a desire to be content with the status quo. They tend to be superstitious about conditioning and taking medicine. In fact, apart from symptomatic effects such as stopping coughs and reducing fever, any medicine has no effect on the tuberculosis bacteria. Especially those medicines advertised, they mislead patients the most. Although such medicines are not directly harmful to the human body, they attract patients to take them for a long time, and easily miss the proper timing of treatment, to the point of being unrecoverable, spending countless amounts of money, and still sacrificing their lives. Is this not unjust and in vain?</p>
<p>(3) Coughing Up Blood from Lung Disease is a Happy Thing</p>
<p>When a patient with lung disease coughs up blood, it will inevitably cause some fear in the patient's mind. In fact, if a patient with lung disease has a hemoptysis phenomenon, it is a happy thing. Because in this way, one can seize the opportunity to seek medical treatment without hesitation. In today's developed medicine, stopping bleeding is not difficult, but after stopping the bleeding, do not forget the importance of fundamental treatment, in order to achieve the goal of completely curing lung disease.</p>
<h3>Notre Dame Infant Asylum Asks for Generosity from All Sectors</h3>
<p>Saving Suffering Children with No Clothes and No Food</p>
<p>The Notre Dame Infant Asylum at 201 Pudong Road, Xujiahui, writes: "Respected Sirs, In recent years, our asylum has received much help from your esteemed newspaper, and we are deeply grateful for your generosity! Your esteemed newspaper has a prominent reputation and benefits the poor in society. It is truly accumulating merit and establishing a legacy. Our asylum is in financial straits, and we are in a state of anxiety as we are facing the possibility of not being able to make ends meet. Therefore, we are writing to you to appeal to people in society to donate generously. If you could publish the current suffering of poor children in winter who have no clothes and no food, it would awaken the enthusiasm of kind-hearted gentlemen and we would be grateful. Or, if you could introduce us to wealthy people in Shanghai to inspire a spirit of generosity, it would greatly benefit society. Many requests are made above, we feel extremely apprehensive, and respectfully implore. With best wishes, Notre Dame Infant Asylum."</p>
