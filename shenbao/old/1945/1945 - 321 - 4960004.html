<h3>國軍三面包團錦州　切斷通往葫蘆島交通　長春共軍為蘇軍繳械</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿四日專電〕國軍越連山後，繼續推進，向北閃擊錦州，其前鋒部隊已包圍錦州，國軍之第十三軍裝甲部隊進展之速，殊出共黨意外，該城位於山海關及瀋陽之間，爲國軍進入東北之第二道門户，共黨在該處週圍置有重兵。現國軍正進攻南西北三門，而錦州通往胡蘆島之交通，業被切斷。據謂盟軍已切斷錦州東北五哩之小村，因此葫蘆島亦陷於孤立地位，而失却其軍事上重要性。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿四日專電〕據確息，進入長春之共軍，已於十八日被蘇軍繳械，長春現由蘇軍警備，市面較前安定。此項消息，係由今日自長春飛返北平之人員傳出，業已證實。據談：當行營人員陸續返平之第三日，蘇軍即將共軍所接收之警察局包圍繳械，局長張慶和亦被拘兩次，共黨份子均被驅出長春，其餘則改用木棒，協助蘇軍維特秩序。數日來長春東北行營前，及上高攤販市塲，均由蘇軍增崗警戒，上高較前爲繁榮。現國軍積極準備，隨時飛往長春。</p>
<p>〔本報天津廿四日專電〕美軍陸戰隊一度登陸之靑島，北郊方而本星期三夜突遭共產黨軍隊之擊襲，中央第八軍聞警應戰，共黨見中央有備，引退逸去。</p>
<p>〔聯合社天津二十四日電〕國軍開人東北第一星期，已突出關外三百華里，共軍正在節節退却。雙方雖曾發生小衝突，但迄未發生劇烈戰事。共軍雖揚言將在錦州作第一次抵抗，但國軍正以每日九十里之速度，向該地推進，五六日內當可抵達，屆時如能一舉而將錦州攻下，則不出三星期即可開到瀋腸。據中國官方消息，自蘇軍在東北各地將日軍繳械撤退後，遺下日軍配備堆積如山，即爲當地共軍伺隙取去，用以攻擊國軍。由本星期內情形觀之，共軍顯係放棄山東及靠近長城以南各地。共軍或將繼續阻止食糧運往平津，並儘量破壞鐵路，使國軍給養運送遲緩，同時使上海·靑島·及北平各工廠，無從獲得煤斤。據悉：共軍在關內計劃，將暫時採取此種破壞手段，而將共主力移往東北，抵抗國軍。國共組織聯合政府，固可解決內戰，但在目前似巳不可能。某方盛傳，蘇聯將不顧中蘇友好條約，提議將東北劃爲西伯利亞及中國問之緩衝區。中國戰區美軍司令魏德邁，及美國務卿貝爾納斯雖曾宣稱，美軍即將撤回，惟平津靑島及秦皇島各地美軍，迄無撤離華北準備。其已遺送回國者的五千人，留駐此聞者尙有五萬餘人，兩相比較不過什一而已。</p>
<p>〔中央社天津二十四日電〕共產軍縱續滋擾津郊，頃派僞津沽縣長任志遠，率衆四百餘人，　入津南郊小站一帶，向農民徵糧徵款，並與津縣保安隊二百餘人，在距天津四十里之蘆北口，發生衝突，雙方均有傷亡。</p>
<h3>我與蘇方談判討論焦點　中央軍開入東北　應解除一切可能武力抵抗</h3>
<p>〔合衆社重慶二十四日電〕今日合衆社自可靠方面獲悉，在現行中蘇談判中，由蘇聯解除東九省一切中國雜色部隊之武裝，包括傳聞由蘇方武裝之共產軍在內，乃討論焦點之一。中國政府堅持在中央軍開入東九省之際，蘇方應將一切可能之武力抵抗，減少至最低限度。談判之其他各點，尙有：（一）蘇方應保證長春，瀋隊，哈爾　與齊齊哈爾等重要飛　　，供中央空軍使用。由此可知中國政府仍在計劃以美機由中國飛行員駕駛，空運軍隊至東九省。（二）蘇方應採取適當描置，保證目下問在束九省之中國政府官史之安卞。依目前之情勢觀之，蘇方顯已允予保護，因一部份留駐畏春之中國政府官吏，已於最後一分鐘打消撤退。同一方面復吿合衆社云：中國政府已通知蘇聯政府，設蘇軍撤退工作之完成，因此而較中蘇條約規定之期限爲遲，中國政府對此種需要完全諒解。蘇方對中國政府建議之態度，目前尙無所知，此間尙未接獲莫斯科之答覆。</p>
<h3>撤離長春接收人員　現留北平待機返任</h3>
<p>〔聯合社北平廿四日電〕國民政府接收東九省官員共計三百餘人，自本月十七日起撤回，聯合社記者自其他可靠方面探得消息如下：</p>
<p>長春並非公開由共軍佔領，惟當地市長與公安局長均傾向八路軍。兩人並非共黨，亦非軍官。共軍已另行任命市長，但尙未就職。日來因重慶方而宣佈已與蘇聯商定接收辦法，故人心大見安定。</p>
<p>第一批到長春中央人員，曾受民衆熱烈歡迎，爭詢國軍何時可到。重慶方面已有關於長春情形之影片開映。十一月七日爲蘇聯革命紀念，蘇軍司令馬林諾斯基曾設宴招待中國代表團，席間演說多以中蘇親善爲言。兩日後由中國代表團答席，至十一月十二日接收交通部與郵政局，移歸中央政府管理。此時因營口事件，雙方關係已頗緊張。共軍於蘇軍撤退後，即開入營口，並向美國運輸艦載運登陸國軍開槍射擊。</p>
<p>外傳熊式輝氏返渝曾携帶蘇方要求或接收條件若干，此說未能證實。據北平益世報载：蘇軍本已遵照中于蘇條約，自長春開始撤退，此時乃令軍隊二萬人復回長春，以維持治安。東九省大部份現已在共軍控制之下，長春報紙七家，已有六家爲八路軍接收，廣播電台亦由共軍管轄。聞有日軍的四萬人至六萬人也絕繳械，逃往吉省北部，與　軍對峙，此說　未證實。東北日僑及大部份已繳械之日軍，正在靜候逍送回國。聞英蘇兩國對於外交局勢，均極注意，此抓關切情形頗有助於國民政府。自長春撤退之接收人員，仍留此問，待機返任。</p>
<h3>石志仁報吿　通車狀況</h3>
<p>〔中央社北平廿四日電〕交通部特派員石志仁，本日由平赴津，據稱，北寗路東行車已過楡關，至達綏中，平承路通至密雲，密雲以北據報有大部匪徒盤據，沿途製擊擾亂，截至十六日止，我方死亡百餘人。平綏路東至南口，平漢路通至石家莊，惟滹沱河橋梁被匪破壞兩孔，新樂河橋已經修復通車，經匪徒破壞之處，尙須徒步聯絡。天津至唐山間被匪徒破壞兩處，津浦路通至滄縣，德縣濟南間正在搶修，徐州至蚌埠間通車，徐州至濟南間因鄒縣·滕縣·臨城等處有匪盤據，三段不通。膠濟路靑島·濟南間通車。平漢路鄭州至漢口，新鄉至彰德均通車，隴海路洛陽至鄭州通車，鄭州至中牟間，爲匪破壞不通，正太路石家莊至太平間，微山橋及陽泉二處爲匪破壞，不能通車，各路被匪破壞之處，路方工程隊正配合軍隊進展，盡力搶修。</p>
<h3>共軍自冀移向熱河　另路由包頭西竄圖擾綏西</h3>
<p>〔聯合北平廿四日電〕第十一戰區外交處今日報吿：中共軍隊自冀省大規模向熟河移動，由此可與中央軍向東北平行前進。同時並有共軍部隊正沿平綏路向大同推進。據稱：自十一月十一日起，即見八路匪軍紛紛北上，向熱河前進。所過河北鄕問，輒向農民强徵糧食。其路錢係循公路經三河·襄河·玉田·豐鎭等地，均在北平山海關之間。</p>
<p>〔中央社歸綏廿四日電〕共軍兩股，約一二千人，由包頭附近西竄。一股竄至烏拉特前西公旗營盤，一股竄入安北境台崇地帶，有進擾綏西企圖。</p>
<p>〔中央社靑島廿三日電〕魯境共軍早有計劃企圖阻撓國軍沿膠濟路西進，廿三日晚十時卅分，共軍第五師最强悍之十三十四兩團，向駐蘭村之國軍杜建道部王家楨營之一部襲擊。國軍當即展開，予以痛擊，激戰至廿二日晨七時，匪勢不支，向馬山方面潰竄。是役淸查匪徒死傷四百餘名，棄屍一百七十餘具，內有中級匪首多名，並俘匪十三名，鹵獲三八式步槍若干枝，國軍僅負傷二人，此爲國軍開抵靑島後第一次被襲擊。</p>
<h3>豫南共軍　增援竄擾</h3>
<p>〔中央社開封廿三日電〕豫南共軍李先念部八千餘人，附砲數門，十九日竄至蘇家河千家棚一帶騷擾，並向我地方團隊進犯。同時共軍第一一七團大舉增援，激戰一晝夜，刻有進佔陡沙河模樣。</p>
<h3>洛墓蓋斯等在渝　謁蔣主席商談東北局勢</h3>
<p>〔合衆社重慶二十四日電〕美國陸戰隊第三兩棲部隊司令洛基少將，今日偕同吳頓少將由滬來渝，晋謁蔣主席。據可靠方面消息，蔣主席於過去數日間，曾與美第七艦隊司令巴貝，美海軍次長蓋斯，及日本賠償委員會杜魯門總統代表鮑萊，討論華北東北局勢，及有關各項國際問題。消息靈通方面稱：蔣主席與洛基少將，仍就上述間題加以討論。又悉蓋斯鮑萊及巴貝等，已於昨日離渝。</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶廿四日電〕美總統杜魯門所派日本貽款專員鮑萊。美海軍次長蓋斯及賴遜少將，來此考察公畢，今日乘飛機赴琉球。蓋斯將赴馬尼刺，鮑萊則回東京。</p>
<h3>美留中印緬物資　我組織委會接收</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿四日電〕爲接收美軍在中印緬境內遺留物資，政院特令山軍政·財政·經濟·交通四部，生產局·運輸管理局·航空委會·衛生署及善後總署等九機關，各派代表聯合組織委會，負責辦理，茲悉善後總署已派定技正華鳳翔充任代表。</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿四日電〕據悉美軍一部剩餘物資，已售子救濟總署，其中一部即將運往上海，充救濟我國之用，運來物資中，包括大麥·麵粉·醫藥用品·食物·衣服·車輛·建築器材及原料，總計約五萬噸。</p>
<h3>美軍指定專門委會　協助抑平本市物價　魏德邁將軍昨表示決心</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國戰區美軍總司令魏德邁將軍（見圖），昨在建設大厦上海基地司令部招待記者，由史特拉特梅耶將軍作陪，魏將軍對記者所提問題，均有詳細解答，尤其對上海物價，堅決表示有抑平之必要，魏將軍宣稱：本市有不法商人，利用時機，高抬物價，乘機詐期美軍人員，余對於此項事件，已擬取有效辦法，茲已指定專門委員會，商討合理處置原則，若一般商人仍不能顧全商業道德，繼續用不法行爲亂抬物價，則本司令部將採取斷然措置，嚴禁美軍與之交易，並附帶聲明，此等措置，並非含有恐嚇之意，乃表示美軍方面對抑平物價之決心。次答覆記者所詢各問題如下：</p>
<p>孝慮撥派船隻助我運兵東北</p>
<p>（一）中國當局已政府撥給船隻多艘，以便運兵進駐東北，美政府對此正考慮中。中國方面刻尙未宣布，是否在葫蘆島及營口登陸。（二）在東北方而—包括山海關以北區械—美國目下無一兵一卒進駐。自蘇聯在八月八日參加對日作戰後，美軍即將全部情報人員撤回，東北亦劃入隊聯戰區，不受中國戰地司令管辖，因此，東北目下各項問題，均由中蘇兩國直接交涉。（三）美軍在華整個政策，須由美政府決定，本人之職務，係執行政策非建立政策。魏將軍續謂：截至目前，美政府尙無撤回華北美軍之指示。</p>
<p>租借案中物資繼續交我政府</p>
<p>（四）租借案中關於供給中國物資及裝配中國軍隊之契的，今仍存在，目前美政府之指示，乃將已運到及在中途之物資繼續交於中國中央政府。按照該契的之規定，美方應裝配中央軍隊三十九個師，刻下已裝配訓練完舉者有二十個師，尙餘十九個師，現正在裝配中。魏將軍續稱：周恩來氏在渝曾言及，美方將裝配中央軍隊七十個師，此說誠係誤會。（五）協助中國建立新海陸空軍，美當局本有此計劃，惟目前尙未接到關於組織軍事顧問團之正式指示。</p>
<p>遺送日俘回國每日祗運三千</p>
<p>（六）關於遺運日俘回國事，照目前情形，美當局所有之運輸工具，祇能每日遺回三千人，至本月底止，美軍當能將日俘三萬五千人遣回。按美軍統計，在山海關以北，黃河以南區域內，有日俘的五十萬人，若欲全部遺回，則至少需時六個月至八個月。又麥克阿瑟元帥云，倘短時期內在日職務稍暇擬來華一行。</p>
<h3>統一船舶調配　成立一新機構</h3>
<p>劉鴻生盧作孚主持</p>
<p>〔本報重慶二十四日電〕船舶調配委員會，下月一日成立，統一支配長江船隻之軍用民航，由劉鴻生。盧作孚分任正副主任委員，於交通部內辦公，上海則另設主委辦事處，由徐學禹主持，並於宜昌，漢口，南京，天津，靑島等地分設辦事處。原有之後勤部船舶管理處，戰時運輸局之水運總局與長江復員委員會均取消。又電，民聯輪二十二晨六時半離渝。</p>
<h3>我科學家發明　胃潰痬新療法</h3>
<p>〔合衆社紐約二十三日電〕紐約大學醫學院經多年之研究，頃已發明胃潰　新療法，據稱能在四小時內減輕病家痛苦，發明人爲中國科學家郭泰（譯音）博士，其方法即以預先消化之蛋白質「阿米基恩」使病家服食，二三星期後，再以X光　之，病象則霍然若失。</p>
<h3>蔣主席定明日發表　政府擬採經濟措施</h3>
<p>我通知美國批准國際貨幣協定</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿四日電〕頃悉蔣主席將於本月廿六日（星期一）下午，對於國內目下經濟狀况及政府擬採取之措施，作重要之發表。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿三日電〕財長文生今日宜布，中國大使館通知國務院，謂該國已批准勃萊頓胡特貨幣協定。該的批准者除美國以外，中國居第二，該約規定穩定國際貨幣，並設立國際銀行，以助復興。按該項協定須經參加國家百分之六十五簽署，始能發生效力。</p>
<h3>西北師來2</h3>
<p>— 房滄浪</p>
<p>三　洞天福地寫哈薩克</p>
<p>今天所謂哈薩克問題，無論就種族·歷史·或地理環境言，都可證明，這不過是中華民族西北諸支中的一個宗族家務，絕對不是什麼少數民族問題。我們遠考往史，哈薩克人，實爲漢代康居之遺胤，一部混血種因爲游牧中亞很久，後人乃數典忘祖，有認哈族與中亞吉爾吉思族同種說。據我個人最近在甘新兩省調查所知，純哈薩克族的分佈地區，在伊犁·塔城·奇台·烏蘇·鎭西·焉耆·迪化各地，人數的有五十萬。在新蒙邊境及中蘇未定界的，的有十餘萬。民國二十七年以後，由鎭西一帶游牧，而至甘肅之河西，以及靑海省境以內的哈族，則不足二萬人。據軍委會靑康邊區專員金在冶吿我，西藏境內現在也有少數哈族，爲數不足五百人。哈胞的膚色，淡黑而略帶紅潤，多毛肥滿，軀幹偉大，有別於藏番。語言及文字則略同理回，識字的很少，文盲的占百分之九十。哈族從十六仳紀起，才信奉回敎，他們的姓字，漸漸喜歡採用漢姓。精於騎射，酷喜吃燻肉。終年生活在風沙中，生性野放，不懂什麼時做法律，剽掠成了家常便飯。他們需要敎養，不懂什麼呌做一自治」，說他也要「自治」，那眞是大舞台對過的招脾「天曉曉得」。</p>
<p>我在河西訪問哈族就撫的首領胡社庫思曼二人時，曾將政府關切張掖·酒泉·敦煌各地哈民生活，給予食糧現金的消息，詳細吿訴他們，以及許多在內外候信的哈族婦女，他們感動而流淚。他們已能理解，給予他們武器的，並不見得是一抓「慈惠」。他們揭養着壁上所掛的一幅　蔣主席、的玉照，以回語向我說：「這個大官，比朱長官大，也更仁愛。」</p>
<p>四　今日之河西</p>
<p>河西是甘新通路的走廊，在地圖上正像一條蜂腰。靑海，寗夏，在牠的兩側。漢武帝時代建置的河西四郡，那武成·張掖·酒泉·敦煌·四座大城都成了今日甘新大道的要衝。現在是廿肅第六第七兩個行政督察區的轄境，計轄十六縣及一個設治局。酒泉全縣，不過十四萬人口，地瘠民窮，水利待興。老百姓終年辛苦耕耘所得之食糧，除去各項負担以外，已難溫飽，常軍隊過境，蔬菜不足供應的時候，在安西·金塔·鼎新·這些極苦的地帶，老百姓幾乎把他們所僅餘的一碟　菜，都拿出來幫助了軍隊，而毫無怨言。他們大都沒有受過敎育，在這三縣地方，我只會見兩位中學畢業生，但是他們的愛國熱情，却無遜東南。他們的市塲，還是上古的物物交換制，在金塔鄕下，輕易也看不見鈔票，那裏旣無囤積，也無投機商。　河西人民歷年所受的痛苦，河西地方的重要性，是稍有地理常識的人們所共知的。我觀察河西二月，我看到河西今年的麥收，還算不錯，平均的在七成以上。小麥的質地特別好，在高台張掖這些地方，每百斤小麥，可以多磨十斤粉。河西的水利工程，如酒泉以西的鴛鴦池，高台縣境的三淸渠，都已興築成功。三淸渠已於最近完成放水。但除此以外，水利的建設，還沒有達到理想的階段，祁連山的蓄水庫，必須做，但還沒有做，原因是經費無着，材料不易來。</p>
<p>說到河西水利，不由就會聯想到西北的交通。甘肅建設的重點是「水利第一」「交通第一」。水利工作已經在做，我們現在暫且期待着，但是說到交通現狀，那就差得多。西北公路局，在何競武局長時代，據說他是將全力傾注到「軍事第一」上面去了，所以現在路雖有而無車，車雖有而時停。八月以前，河西還沒有班車，現在也難說。郵運也是要倚賴獸力。由蘭州到凉州（武成）兩百公里的距離，汽車一日可達，而新聞紙及信件的寄遞，動輙要費時一個禮拜。寄到嘉峪關以西的信件，當然要幾十天了。</p>
<p>在由河西的東歸途中很幸運的，在張掖會見居覺生樊崧甫二先生。居先生是來看看西北的司法現狀乘便遊歷河西。樊先生此來，爲的巡察軍風紀。我對二位先生的歡迎詞，只有「來得正好」四個字。後來承蒙居先生的不棄，幾次下詢我對河西的觀感，我的率直的報吿是如此：「河西的常務之急，首須增產，但貧苦的農民將農具送進典當，負擔的月息，竟達千分之二百。增產必須先謀水利，可惜水利工作人員，大多閒着沒事做。政治正在改進，交通尙待努力，紳權大於一切。而縣衛生院的全部經費少到竟不如一個醫生的個人開支，所以人民還鬧病」。</p>
<h3>南京大署殺　界行將公佈　　〔本報南京二十四日電〕首都日寇罪行調查委員會，月來積極工作，共初步調查，業已竣事，不日即可公佈，此一南京大屠殺之驚人罪行，將以最確鑒之證件說明其殘酷瘋狂。根據紅萬字會與崇善堂報吿，伊等曾聯合組織埋隊五大隊，連續工作四月以上，計埋男女兒童屍身一五五三三八人，而私人之掩埋隊尙不與，據估計我同胞之被殘殺者，至少在二十萬人以上。現京市市民，向罪行調查會控訴日寇之姦淫，沉江，虐殺者日有十數起。星期論壇　政治協商會議  章士釗　　　　協商會　，政府與各　派開　定國是之所為設也。若而會名，者而規章，若而名額，若而人選，自發意以迄今茲，時歷數月，仍未揭布。雖有下月一日召開之訊，而中共代表周恩來何時飛赴延安，何日重返陪都，撲朔迷離，誰能確斷？甚矣此會如拚七巧板之難也！雖然，揭布之日，非即成功之日，預計誠序所之，艱困猶百倍於未揭布時。或曰，吾吾，凡軍政大計，政府與中共礎商復磋商，規模早具於會外，几席之上，亦依形式補苴云爾，何難之有？至各黨派與無黨派云云，如劇塲之能套然，聊寶點綴，原不足輕重，是故此會唯有不開，開則未有不成，校　難易而訾營　，與杞人之憂何異。是說也，愚疑之。　　茲會之起，國起於中共之不戢，然中共之所爲不戢者，軍也，非政也。尋軍有軍力，政有政力，倘軍力可以定天下，則政府如禹之馴龍她，驅中共而放之　可已，何賴夫有此會？爲蓋此會者，所爲劑政力之不平，而軍力不與焉。一言政力，則中共所得爲代表全民之公意，無過一小小部分，毋寗謂各黨派所代表者其數大，無黨派允大，顧大者有力翻若無力，政府縱未存廠與委她之心，而己身似轉有謙讓未讓之　。距今以能，中共挟各黨派以自張，後者復附前者以自見，其意若日，時唯中共之亂，政府始覺有各黨派之在側，不然，悠悠二十年中，何嘗有星星民意，足資發舒？今茲所爲，亦從趙孟爭貴而已。是說也，愚慨然久之。　　愚曩主調和立國，而調和之爲物，非以精神　之，勢必無成。如此等會，古今中外之旋號召而旋失敗者，殊未易一二數。法關西之三族會議Eatst　Generaux其允著也。三族者，一日貴族　　敎侶，一曰平民。在路易十六時，三者足以舉法國之全，大革命後，國政就　不定，與吾辛亥以還之亂象略同。於是千七百八十七年巴力門宣言，以三族協商，鞏固國本，與吾此次會議之以參政會爲張本者亦略似。顧路易初則示惠二族以抑平民，浸假藉手平民以裁二族，彼三族者抑又互相水火，捭闔靡己，卒至漁汗大號，隨路易之王朝厄運，尸史迹之空名以終。此無他，調和之眞意失之也。　　愚以輿情之疑慮，與史例之昭明，發爲三義，川資申敝：一，政府應須認識全國之眞力量，以開誠布公四字爲會議礎石，絕勿掉以輕心，聽其成毀，徒視茲會爲連字符，而別尋字訓於他途。二，中共應須放下兵器，以眞實愛國心與天下人以共見，不得以武力之高下，使茲會之早晚時價未同。三，各黨派與無黨派諸公，一本至誠之心，堅持獨立之見，不爲人貓之爪，不爲人牛之後，妄自菲薄，重累國家。三義旣昭，高會斯舉。有一不至，母寗不開。非惟法國三族會議爲股鑒，即吾往者洛陽國難會議之覆轍亦不遠也。</h3>

<p>聯合國機構籌委會　全體大會昨開幕　英代表發言力主控制原子能　　〔路透社倫敦二十四日電〕聯合國準備委員會今日舉行首次會機時，英代表培克對於最近又趨活動之悲觀派，曾予抨擊。培克謂，吾覺吾人之工作，決非片刻之成就，頗以爲慰。按準委會之工作，在審查並採取十四國所組執委會經十星期埋頭工作後所決定之建議事項。五十一國會員國今日均出席，會議不啻爲一聯合國機構之全體委员會議。培克之言有謂，余深信聯合國能應付時代之試騐，其他各國想亦能信英國人民具有不使此次再吿失敗之決心。今日恐戄再度發生戰爭者，竟已不止一國，如有人謂今日仍有若干政府願意再發生戰爭，或竟準備戰爭，誠屬不應之至。各國政府均已將戰時生產，易爲和平生產，世界上已無一民族能再尤其政府發動戰爭。培克繼述第一次聯合國全體大　之緊急任務稱，各國政府必須爲其人民作若千關於科學之工作，航空之發明至今已四十四年，然已受盡人間之咒駡，原子能如不予控制，則更將使人類絕種，此乃人類之發明，必能由人類控制之。吾人之政府當經由聯合國機構設立某種組織，集偉大人物之心血，使原子能爲人類服務而不至於毀滅人類，願吾人所擬建立之機構，能永遠消滅戰爭之罪行。蘇代表格羅米哥建議，玻利維亞代表沙拉曼加附議，決定使會議延至下星期一舉行，以便諸代表有充分考慮議程之時間。後於舉行執委會討論議程草案時，巴西駐英大使伐勒當選主席。外交辯論第二日　英外相演辭要點　決本公正基礎與各國往還增強聯合國力量奠定和平　　〔中央社記者任玲遜廿三日倫敦電〕英下院今日午後進行第二日外交問題辯論，英外相貝文出席致詞，說明國際關係，列舉三大要點：（一）英政府將遵守與外國大小國家往還，木公正基礎之原則。（二）惟有坦自，始能消除國際間之猜忌心理。（三）英政府深信聯合國組織，乃奠定國際安全之工具。英國準備增强聯合國組織之力量，同時並願見此新組織，繼續發展爲世界眞正之世界大會，有國際法律爲其支柱，並有世界警衛武力，執行此項世界法律。此外貝文尙涉及其他多項問題。關於原子彈間題，渠認聯合國組織首次大會，旣定於明年一月間召開，故無需舉行特別會議，以考慮阿特里杜魯門及金氏共同擬定之原干彈建議。渠信安全理事會於成立後，將考慮如何設立原子能委員會之建識。遠東顧問委會　決派員赴日　作實地觀察　　〔中央社華府二十三日電〕遠東顯問委員會本日午後決定不久將派人赴日，俾與麥帥磋商，並作「實地」之觀警。官方發言人謂，的二三週內可啓程，如認爲將純以學者風度解決受制日本有關之各種複雜問題，實爲錯誤，故委員會決定派人訪日。本日委員會會議達兩小時，檢討中美澳三國小組會所準備有關經濟之文件，經仔細磋商後，會路加修正通過。委員會下次會議中，將討論一般政策之報吿，及盟國佔領軍頒發有關經濟之手令。戴高樂發表　施政大綱　法議會信任政府　　〔路透社巴黎二十四日電〔戴高樂將軍昨於議會發表施政大綱後，議會即於歡呼聲中，通過對戴高樂新政府之信任票。戴高樂施政大綱中誓法國將爲東西之連鎖，但無論在何情勢中，不得成一政治的盒子。（象棋戲中）政府現正力　　和英法　國之政策，法國　與義大利重訂協約，且準備與民主的西班牙恢復密切之關係。戴高樂繼乃宣布信用放款電氣保險業，均將收歸國家辦理，並將改革行政·公共事務·司法·國防·已列爲議案一件，提交議會表決。調查偷襲珍球港事件　天前國務卿赫爾證言　　〔路透社華　頓二十四日電〕前國務卿赫爾告國會調查珍珠港　委員會，謂在一九四一年外交談判最後吃緊之數日中，渠並未思及日人攻擊珍珠港之可能性。又謂，是年夏季邱吉爾與羅斯福總統舉行大洋會議，草擬大西洋憲章時，邱氏會聲明英國必須佈置多時，始能從事太平洋之軍事行動。惟總統歸京後，曾語日大使，日本如不停止侵略，則美國將取自衛步驟。赫爾並爲自已與羅斯福總統辯護謂，日人之偷襲珍珠港，非由美國挑釁而成。渠雖曾警吿羅斯福等，謂日軍有隨時隨地進攻之可能，但美軍最初之注意，仍在西太平尖。赫爾備有美日談判詳細紀錄，某中足以證明渠與羅總統會苦心孤詣，阻止日軍閥在亞洲取侵略行逕。日本戰犯　展緩開審　　〔聯合社華盛頓二十四日電〕陸軍部今日宣佈：因國際關係，日本戰犯東條等已展緩開審，此項決議已通知麥克河瑟元帥。美國外交官關於此事，頃加以解釋稱：各戰犯運反戰時公法及殘殺平民部份，仍將立刻予以審訊。美方甚願其他國家亦參加審問，特向麥帥所發出之訓令，並未提及對蘇聯現行談判情事。　　松罔洋右準備自首　　〔合衆社東京前日外相松罔洋右，已被聨合國列爲戰犯，於本月十九日下令逮捕，崁悉松岡已於今日到達東京準備自首。松岡之子在其東京寓所聲稱，其父因病臥床甚久，不能見客。　　麥帥下令逮捕川島　　〔中央社東京二十三日合衆電〕麥帥頃下令逮捕川島大佐。川島前曾隨日第六軍駐漢口，現諒係隨日中部軍駐京都。麥帥總部令川島應押至巢鴨。日本樞密院　昨正式廢除　　〔聯合社東京二十四日電〕日本櫃密院係日　諮詢機關，成立已六十一年，茲經日皇批准，於今日正式　除。現任　　大臣　　戶僕爵。　　日皇戎裝像已不合時代　　〔聯合社東京廿四日電〕宮內省今日宣佈：自明年一月一日起，日皇之軍裝　　，將代以平民服裝之新照相，現在懸褂之照片，已認爲不合時代。　　日担負鉅額美佔領軍費　　〔聯合社東京廿四日電〕據共同通訊社消息：日本每年應担負美佔領軍　約一百億日元之鉅。按照目前兌換率計算，約合美金六六七·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元。甘地函華維爾　要求釋放印度國民軍虜　加爾各答發生羣衆大暴動　　〔合衆社新德里二十三日電〕今日合衆家社自可靠方面獲悉：甘地已致函印督華維爾，促其根據人道立塲，並爲「未來英印之敦睦關係計」，將印度國民軍俘虜釋放。　　〔聯合社加爾各答二十四日電〕此間發生紛擾業已三日，昨全市槍聲不絕，到處空氣緊張。亂源原在市中心區，現已漫延至各區，據報，自昨晨發生衝突後，已有五十人受傷。紛擾起因於學生集隊在印國民紀念日舉行示威，遂演變爲不可控制之羣衆暴動，雜以搶劫及種種遠法破壞之舉菲律賓獨立　明年可完成　　〔中央社華盛頓廿四日電〕杜魯門咨文國會制立法案，批准菲待賓之總選「至遲不逾一九四六年四月三十日。新選出之菲總統副總統及義員等，至遲於五月二十八日應一律視事」傳於明年七月四日能完成菲律賓完全獨立。邱吉爾貝文　一塲呑戰　係希政潮所引起　　〔聯合社倫敦廿三日電〕英下院今日辯論外交時，貝文穴佈會向希政府建　三年後召　國民大會決定君主間題　吉爾即暴跳如雷，高呼　　之君主共和問題，事屬　　，若展期兩三年解決，殊屬錯誤。貝文亦反唇相議曰，欲於此時在希臘召開國民大會，予敢與任何人打賭。下議院中遂因希臘政治風潮發生舌戰。美太平洋艦隊　新舊司令昨交替　舊金山劃為軍港　　〔聯合社華盛頓十四日電〕雷姆賽少將已任爲太平洋艦隊副司令，原任副司令史普魯盎斯已升任司令。　　〔聯合社珍珠港二十三日電〕據此間宜佈：尼米資上將定明日在某潛艇以太平洋艦隊司令權，移交新任司令史普魯盎斯上將。尼米資　昨在奧　克蘭談稱：「余前在潛艇升起太平洋艦隊司令旗，今亦將在一潛艇下旗」。　　〔聯合社華盛頓二十三日電〕海軍部今日宣布：自本月二十日起，舊金山已　爲軍港，以代替梅爾島基地。　　〔聯合社舊金山二十四日電〕美海軍界消息：現有軍艦九百六十艘奉令休息，分別停靠美西海岸五處軍港。日本原子實騐所　遭盟軍澈底破壞　十年心血付諸流水　西野博士目擊心傷　　〔合衆社二十四日電〕東京理化研究院所屬之西　試騐室，擁有重三百噸之美國製豆大原子分解器一座，現悉麥帥已下；令於今日將該器毀壞，此後日本將無法研究原子能或製造原子炸彈。另有小型原子分解器四座，亦由麥帥下令摧毀，此舉或係由華府授意，亦未可知。此外京都及大坂帝國六學兩西野原子分解器，亦於破壞後，拋入海中，西野爲日本最負盛各之原子物理學家，據稱，此巨大之原子分解器竟遭毀壞，實屬不幸之極。並曾向其秘書橫山聲稱：此器一毀，余十年心血，等於付諸流水，余現已無所適從，但對宇宙綫仍將　續研究。　　研究歷史　　按日本研究原子能，後於美國六年，如能獲得充分之　，則此現被毀壞之原子分解器，可於一年後供給足以　造原子炸彈一枚之原子能。四野研究室內之原子分解器，與美國所有者相較，原屬微不足道，但如不加毀壞，亦可贈與其他國家，以供研究之用。西野研究原子能，始於一九三五年，初以一重二十三噸之常磁石爲原子分解器之基底，但不合用，一九三七至一九三八年間，西野另自美國加里福尼亞大學發射試騐室之原子能設備中獲得一重二百二十噸之電磁石，於是對原子能乃開始積極研究。　　原斜缺乏　　原子分解器發明人，及原子彈製造人之一之勞倫斯敎授，對西野研究工作曾予抓種協助，一九四一年西野及其同人，曾考慮大量製造原子能，即世所素知之「U—二三五」，但日本軍人對原子能之重要，毫無所知，加以又無充分之鉀以供應用，遂作罷論。自廣島及長崎被原子彈轟炸後，日本科學家對原子能問題，復又軍新熱烈研究。西野又稱：彼有鈾二十二鎊，原思用擴散方法將其分開，不幸有此種設備之試騐室，於空襲時，爲美機炸毀。西野試騐室所有房屋雖悉被炸毀，獨放置原子分解器之一幢，安然無恙，亦屬巧事。　　劻虧一簣　　試器因體積太大，係置於房屋之最低一層，美國雖已知日本有原子分解器，然對其究竟研究至如何程度，則無所知。麥帥在下今前，曾於本月二十日派人至西野試騐室，搜索所有一切關於原子分解器之記錄，免被造失。據京都帝國大學物理學系主任稱：日本於一九四四年末始對原子能發生興趣，一九四五年初海軍雷局曾詢彼能吾製造原子炸彈？彼答稱：不能，本年六月，海軍方面曾予彼鈾十六箱，囑其繼續研究，但日本旋即投降，十六箱袖亦至今未被應用。教育与體育改正「日化」風尙聲中　台省國語總動員　軍政警各方面一致推行　　〔本報台北二十三日航訊〕台灣全省改「日化」風尙之革新運動，已漸展開。有不少商店，已將商會改名商號，日語改說國語。軍政　警各方面對於國語一致積極推行。國語學校，如雨後春荀，到處設立。陸軍第七十軍政治部在太平町東門町等處設立國語講習班，原定招收學生千人，但半日問，報名者竟達四千餘人，而繼續請求報名者仍甚衆多。敎部擬就草案　簡化中學課程　　〔本報重慶二十四日電〕敎育部中等敎育司現已擬就簡化中學課程草案，以便提供將來召集之简化課程會议參考。茲揀悉其內　要點如次：（一）高中以不分組爲原則，仍注重各科平均發展。（二）初中取消分設升學組就業組辦法，注重普通知識與精神之陶冶。（三）高初中教學時數酌予滅少，以増加　外活動時間。（四）酌滅敎學科目，初中童子軍取消，改爲外活動，高中軍訓改變辦法，利用假期舉辦集中訓練，或於高中學業後施予短期人伍訓練。（五）加强中學課外外活動，訂定其範圍及實施辦法。朱部長定今晨　招待蒙受難同志　　〔本市訊〕敎育部長朱家驊氏，到滬之後，對於本市殉國烈士及蒙難同志，異常關懷，因特委託市黨部及上海抗戰蒙難同志會，代爲通知各遺族及蒙難同志，請於今日上午九時，至靜安寺路康樂酒家舉行茶話會，朱部長將親自出席招待，以示撫慰之意。敎育部擬定　工讀生辦法　　救濟一般貧苦學生　　〔大華社重慶航訊〕敎育部爲救濟一般貧苦學生，擬定工續生辦法如下：（二）初中以上各級學校，應盡量減少工役及職員人數，以工讀生代替之。（二）工讀生所學習之課程及其年齡，應略予伸縮餘地。（三）工讀生之待遇，無妨從優，而選定標準，則應嚴格，必須以六分　越，而家境貧寒者爲限。敎育局增設　婦女職補校　　〔本布訊〕本市敎育局爲掃除文盲，曾舉辦民衆學校多所，普遍全滬，一面對於本市婦女敎育逐步推進，同時更注重於婦女職業敎育。聞該局已決定在膠州路民衆實騐學校內，增設婦女職業補習學校一所，將分設縫紉，剌　，烹飪，音樂等科。現正進行籌備，決於最近期招生開學云。廣州僞校員生　舉辦登記　　〔中央社廣州廿三日電〕敎育部廣州區特派員舉辦敵僞專科以上學校學生登記，及省敎廳舉辦敵僞中等校敎職員及學生登記，於廿二日下午四時截止，前者登記學生共四百人，其中已在專上學校畢業者一百五十人，定十二月十五日至十七日舉行甄別試，後者登記教職員廿餘人學生三九三八人，定十二月十日甄試。市立中小學　調整辦公費用　　照原數增加兩倍　　〔本報訊〕上海市各市立中小學以近日物價高漲，原有辦公費及圖書殺備費等，不激甚距，紛紛請求市敎育局予以調整。茲悉市敎育局

<p>逰藝界遊藝界的前途  黃嘉音　　前幾天在上海文化界歡迎張道藩先生的茶會中，遊藝界的代表張冶兒先生代表上海的遊藝界大聲疾呼，呌大家不要忘記了遊藝界，不要遺棄遊藝界，這話是說得够痛心的。　　申報的遊藝界當然是比較廣義的遊藝界，包括着電影，話劇，平劇。……以及其他能起領導社會作用，同時能調劑生活，使民衆休憩身心的一切正當的遊藝和娛樂。因爲遊藝界的力量是發生在不知不覺中的，所以我們更不能不特別加以注意。對好的遊藝加以鼓勵發揚，對壞的予以指導並作建設性的批評。　　我們覺得一種遊藝能繼續生存下去，不是沒有原因的。它必須能適應環境和時代，同時迎合一部份人的需要。記得在十月初旬，張治中先生招待重慶各界歡送毛澤東先生的時候，曾請山藥旦等演唱滑稽而諷刺的相聲和有宣揚抗戰意義的大鼓，博得聽衆熱烈的歡迎。重慶的平民茶樓酒館中，也時常可以聽見賣唱的大人和小孩在唱抗戰的民間歌曲。懺這一種帶有前進的意識，能領導民衆跟着時代進步的遊藝，祇要宣傳的意味不得使觀衆討厭，我們相信都是有前途的。訪梅蘭芳博士  本報記者　　　蘭芳博士是近年來各界人土所最掛念的敬仰的一位一藝人。記得在重慶的時候，抗戰剛勝利，報紙上登出梅博士刮去鬍子準備登台的消息，街頭巷尾的人，莫不引以爲談話的資料，可見國人封於這位伶王的注意和關心了。　　本月二十三日，我到馬斯南路一間小洋房裏見到了久仰的梅先生，在一間中西合璧的會客室中　他談了半小時。我吿訴他說內地的人大家都很關心他，同時對於他過去幾年以蓄鬚表示不願登台的決心，表示很大的敬意。他感喟說，『過去八年的確是很難過去的。』他說他先從北平逃到上海，再從上海逃到香港，結果在香港遇到了太平洋戰事的爆發。後來彼日本人認出了，問他還唱不唱戲，他祇好說『身體不好，需要休養。』後來就回上海來休息了幾年。敵僞屢次要他登台，他都婉拒了。　　　先生笑着說，他過去幾年沒有登台，物價又漲得特別厲害，四個小孩都在讀書，所以生活很成問題。現在抗戰勝利了，他也實在非登台不可了，所以他已定於本月二十八日起在美琪大戲院演唱崑劇十天。這次所以選演崑劇，是因爲覺得崑劇是一種比較高深的藝術，近年來演唱的人很少，實在可惜，同時也因爲以前的　師都在北平，無法南來，所以一時不能演唱京劇。　　我問起他的幾位小孩在那裏，他說較長的兩位男孩葆琛（二十歲）和葆珍在香港戰後都到貴陽進清華學校讀書，大的今年就可巾學畢業，第二的明年也要畢業了。第三位小姐葆玥（十四歲）和第四位葆玖（十二歲）現在都在上海讀書。他說最小的這一位現在已經會唱好幾齣戲了，將來預備讓他正式學戲，登台表演　　五十二歲的梅博士，看起來還不到四十歲的樣子。健康情形好像也很好。　　梅先生過去幾年是以畫畫過日子的。關於少年遊  應鈞　　「少年遊」是吳祖光在成都寫的，引起他寫作的動機是重慶大公報上一篇『北平學生繽紛錄』，記述華北的學生怎樣從艱困的情形下流亡到自由區的故事。由此，勾引起作者離開了十幾年的學校生活，這回憶，這感觸使他寫了『少年遊』。　　劇本寫成了，活躍在紙上的人物，都有熟人的影子，依然是親切動人。所不動的是時代背景，已從自己的週圍搬到了北平，而且更反映了淪陷區可怕的陰影，魔鬼的血蹟。　　也是據說『少年遊』四個女主角都是有索隠的，大姐是趙慧深，二姐是郁風，三妹是劇校學生，四妹就是作者自己的太太，這些人物從平面到立體的舞台上時，每個人都有性格。作者賦與了人性。眞的，這些人物活了。有誰會知道這是可以作爲一頁『劇増外史』呢。　　在『少年遊』中沒有出奇，祇是用平凡的故事『制勝』。靜靜的，像淸淡的流水一樣。雖然有時像山坡下的小石子，輕較的掉在水中，些微有點波動。過後又平靜了，面到結束時，却像火山般崩裂開來，淡淡的再帶給觀衆一股勇氣，無限的力量。　　『少年遊』該　薦給上海觀衆，我這樣想。崑曲値得提倡  蘇少卿　　梅闌芳在美琪演出的戲碼，除了「販馬記」是吹腔外，其餘都是崑曲。梅博士出而提倡崑曲，是極有意議的事，對於文化和戲風很有關係。　　崑曲是元明淸三朝的遺物，不但佔戲曲最高位置，且有害宋以來古曲的存在，在文學方面，也巍然獨立。共中的史劇，多出前代文豪手筆，考據詳實，陳義高尙。又其聲調和美，舉動雅靜，令人聽見，心地和平，矜躁頓釋，眞是盛世元音，承平美育。它的詞曲中，含有古代方言，唐宋音韻，可以給研究文學的人參考。它的好處，實在應提倡保存，再進求發展。　　我覺得現在社會上有地位的人應該想法子從速組織保存國劇會，積極提倡崑曲。痛心話　　『假使這世界還要藝術來裝飾，別再摧殘藝術人了：』——錄自言懸珠絕命書。重慶影劇動態  璞　　史東山，趙丹，顧而已，秦怡，舒繡紋等均在候機返滬。中國製片廠新廠長運靜予已到任，新聘之美國顧問　德漢連日工作繁忙，將該廠歷年出品一一放映，以作參考。公餘之暇，且開兩英文補習班，敎　　演員英文。　　中國製片廠新作『　魂歌』，由湯曉丹導演，康健，王豪等主演，業已攝竣。定元旦在各地公映。　　中央攝影塲高級戰演員擬包一專機飛京，籌備在京攝製工作。　　中央靑年劇社演畢洪深編劇馬彥祥導演之『鷄嗚早看天』，即準備搭輪返京，定元旦在京演出後，來滬上演。　　中國藝術劇社正在上演『芳草天涯』，夏衍編劇，金山導演，賣座極佳。　　金山己應美國華　頓大學之聘，於明春去美講授『中國戲劇史』，其夫人張瑞芳亦將偕同去美。短篇名著敵人　（The　Enemy）（四）  賽珍珠著　朱綺譯　　花子輕輕地說：『不知他是那一國的人？』　　『看來他是個美國人，』貞雄道。他拾起了那破爛的帽子。對了，那上面有着幾個糢糊到幾乎看不出來的字。他說：『這是個美國軍艦上的水兵。』他還把　子上的字唸出來；『美國海軍。」原來這人是個俘虜！　　花子輕呼道：『他是逃出來的，因此他受了傷。』　　『而且傷在背上，』貞雄也同意她的話。　　他們面面相覷地躊躇起來。後來花子才如夢初醒似地說：　　『喂，我們能將他推回海裏去嗎？』　　貞雄反問道：『如果我能的話，你能做嗎？』　　花子說：『我不能，不過要是你能一個人做……』　　貞雄又躊躇了一會。他說：『奇怪、這人如果是健康的話，我可以很輕易地將他交給警察局。我一點都不顧惜他。他是我的敵人。一切美國人都是我的敵人。何况他又只不過是個普通的人。你看他的臉多　。可是他是受了傷的……』　　花十道：『你也不會將他丟下海去的。那麼我們祇好將他招進屋子裘去了。』　　貞雄問：『傭人們怎麽辦？』　　『我們一定要吿訴他們說，我們是預備將他送到警察局裏去的。——我們的確是要將他送去的，貞雄。我們一定要想到我們的孩子和你的地位。如果我們不將這人作爲俘虜交出，太家都有危險。』　　貞雄道：『當然囉，我是不會把他想別種辦法來處置的。』社會服務　本處開始收受捐款使貧苦難胞獲得救濟  寄萍　　公衆意見可代爲發表　　文字簡潔以節省篇幅　　本報爲「社會服務」，今後倡導七項社會事業，昨己述其梗槪。希望各界讀者諸君，抱「爲樂最樂」的宏願，隨時予我們相富的助力，作社會貧苦大衆的後援。使我們在精神上得着偉大的鼓勵，難胞在物質上得着充分的救濟，這便是本處唯一的目標。關於捐款方面，如助學金，醫藥助金，苦兒敎養助金，小本貸金，助產金等，自即日起開始收受。如有捐款數目較大而無法送館的，請用電話通知本處，當派員携正式收據　前面洽。捐款不論大小，一律於次日在本欄公表，以資徵信。　　「社會服務」應該是廣義的，多力面的，而且必須有積極的，建設性的意義，纔可以達到「社會革新」「社會建設」的志願。所以我們除經常辦理七項救濟事業以外，很想　而廣之，爲讚者諸君解決一般公正無私的問題，地不論東西，人不論老幼，諸位心所欲言而無處發洩的，或爲國計民生，或爲大衆福利；或爲公共道德；或爲靑年修養，……等意見，本　願代爲發表。但文字須簡潔，事實須切要，發表後並不致酬，以上幾點，均請注意。申報社會服務處　徵募捐欵　　（一）讀者助學金……救濟淸寒優秀失學子弟，爲國家培植有用人材。　　（二）醫藥助金……救濟一般貧病交迫的苦人，特約醫院，施診給藥，導入康樂之途。　　（三）苦兒敎養助金……拯救無父無母的苦兒，及流浪街童，施以敎養。　　（四）助產金……救助貧苦產婦，指定醫院，免費接生，以盡保產保赤之至意。　　（五）小本貸金……貸與失業貧民，小本經營以資課生。助學金收支報告　　（十一月五日止）　　收入項下　　普通捐款　十四萬九千一百九十七元四角九分　　普通隊　四十四萬一千一百二十二元五角　　榮譽隊　一百六十六萬六千六百在十五元七角　　特種助金　九千一百八十元　　行莊息金　三千四百二十五元一角　　以上共收二百二十六萬九千五百六十元零七角九分　　支出項下　　第九屆普通助金　一百九十萬零一千六百七十元五角　　特種助金　八萬一千七百七十五元　　獎學金　一萬九千六百五十五九　　以上共付二百萬零零三千一百元零五角　　十一月五日止結存法幣二十六萬六千四百六十元二角九分正　　助學金捐款　家醫運動十一萬三千二百十五元二角，張雨文四萬三千元，王廷歆二萬元，朱紹雲八千元，爰居閣九千一百八十元，通如崇海啓五縣同鄕會六千元，項禎記五千元，MrsIyene　C.Kubn美金十元（九月二十四日折合法幣六百七十五元），莫以俊五千元，大新祥烟行張一嗚二千五百元，利用棉織廠一千元，項滋記一千元，六義隊一千二百五十元，祥興機器廠馮達五百元，祥興達記機器工廠五百元，慕淵陶德五百元，馮樹華五百元，王嵇氏三百五十元，受傷女童不受醫藥費一百五十元，無名氏（收據九二六七）一百元，浦緝庭五元，以上捐款已結入捐款收支報吿內。</p>

<h3>National Army Encircles Jinzhou from Three Sides, Cutting Off Transportation to Huludao; Communist Troops in Changchun Disarmed by Soviet Army</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Beiping, 24th] After crossing the Yuelian Mountains, the National Army continued to advance, launching a lightning attack on Jinzhou. Its vanguard troops have already surrounded Jinzhou. The speed of the 13th Army's armored forces' advance greatly exceeded the expectations of the Communists. The city is located between Shanhaiguan and Shenyang and serves as the second gateway for the National Army to enter the Northeast. The Communist Party has stationed heavy troops around it. Currently, the National Army is attacking the south, west, and north gates, and the transportation between Jinzhou and Huludao has been cut off. It is said that the Allied forces have cut off a small village five miles northeast of Jinzhou, thus isolating Huludao and diminishing its military importance.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Beiping, 24th] According to reliable sources, the Communist troops who entered Changchun were disarmed by the Soviet army on the 18th. Changchun is now under the guard of the Soviet army, and the city is more stable than before. This news was brought back by personnel who flew from Changchun to Beiping today and has been confirmed. According to them, on the third day after the personnel of the Northeast Headquarters successively returned to Beiping, the Soviet army surrounded and disarmed the police station taken over by the Communist troops. The director of the station, Zhang Qinghe, was also detained twice. Communist members were expelled from Changchun, while the rest were re-equipped with wooden sticks to assist the Soviet army in maintaining order. In recent days, the area in front of the Northeast Headquarters in Changchun and the Shanggao market have been guarded by increased Soviet troops, and Shanggao is more prosperous than before. Currently, the National Army is actively preparing to fly to Changchun at any time.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Tianjin, 24th] Qingdao, where the U.S. Marine Corps once landed, was suddenly attacked by Communist troops on Wednesday night in the northern suburbs. The Central 8th Army responded to the alarm and fought back. Seeing that the Central Army was prepared, the Communists retreated and fled.</p>
<p>[United Press Tianjin, 24th] In the first week of the National Army's entry into the Northeast, it has advanced 300 li beyond the Guanshan. The Communist troops are retreating steadily. Although small conflicts have occurred between the two sides, no fierce battles have yet taken place. Although the Communist troops have claimed that they will make their first resistance in Jinzhou, the National Army is advancing towards the area at a speed of 90 li per day and should arrive within five or six days. If Jinzhou can be captured in one fell swoop at that time, it will be possible to reach Shenyang in no more than three weeks. According to Chinese official sources, after the Soviet army disarmed and withdrew the Japanese army in various parts of the Northeast, the Japanese army's equipment was left piled up like mountains, which was taken by the local Communist troops at the opportunity to attack the National Army. Judging from the situation this week, the Communist troops are clearly abandoning Shandong and areas south of the Great Wall. The Communist troops may continue to prevent food from being transported to Beiping and Tianjin, and try to destroy railways as much as possible to delay the National Army's supply transportation, while also preventing factories in Shanghai, Qingdao, and Beiping from obtaining coal. It is learned that the Communist troops plan to temporarily adopt this destructive means in Guan Nei (areas south of the Great Wall) and move their main forces to the Northeast to resist the National Army. It would be possible to resolve the civil war with the KMT and the Communist Party forming a coalition government, but it seems impossible at present. It is rumored in some quarters that the Soviet Union will disregard the Sino-Soviet Treaty and propose to divide the Northeast into a buffer zone between Siberia and China. Although U.S. Army Commander in the China Theater, General Wedemeyer, and U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes have declared that the U.S. military will withdraw soon, the U.S. military in Beiping, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Qinhuangdao has not made any preparations to withdraw from North China. Of the 5,000 people who have been sent back to the country, there are still more than 50,000 stationed here, which is only about one-tenth in comparison.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Tianjin, 24th] Communist troops continue to cause disturbances in the suburbs of Tianjin. Recently, they sent the pseudo-Jin Gu County Magistrate Ren Zhiyuan to lead more than 400 people into the Xiaozhan area in the southern suburbs of Tianjin to collect grain and money from the farmers. They also clashed with more than 200 members of the Tianjin County Security Team in Lubeikou, 40 li away from Tianjin. Both sides suffered casualties.</p>
<h3>Focus of Negotiations Between Us and the Soviet Side: Central Army Enters the Northeast, Eliminating All Possible Armed Resistance</h3>
<p>[United Press International Chongqing, 24th] United Press International learned today from reliable sources that one of the focuses of discussion in the current Sino-Soviet negotiations is the disarmament by the Soviet Union of all Chinese miscellaneous troops in the nine eastern provinces, including the Communist troops rumored to be armed by the Soviet Union. The Chinese government insists that when the Central Army enters the nine eastern provinces, the Soviet side should reduce all possible armed resistance to a minimum. Other points of negotiation include: (1) The Soviet side should guarantee that important airfields such as Changchun, Shenyang, Harbin, and Qiqihar are available for the use of the Central Air Force. This shows that the Chinese government is still planning to airlift troops to the nine eastern provinces by American aircraft flown by Chinese pilots. (2) The Soviet side should take appropriate measures to ensure the safety of the current Chinese government officials in the nine eastern provinces. Judging from the current situation, the Soviet side has apparently agreed to protect them, as some Chinese government officials who remained in Changchun canceled their withdrawal at the last minute. The same source also told United Press International that the Chinese government has notified the Soviet government that if the completion of the Soviet troop withdrawal is delayed beyond the timeframe stipulated in the Sino-Soviet Treaty, the Chinese government fully understands this necessity. The Soviet side's attitude toward the Chinese government's suggestions is currently unknown, and no reply has been received from Moscow.</p>
<h3>Personnel Withdrawing from Changchun Awaiting Opportunity to Return to Their Posts in Beiping</h3>
<p>[United Press International Beiping, 24th] A total of more than 300 officials from the National Government who were to take over the nine northeastern provinces have been withdrawing since the 17th of this month. United Press International reporters have learned the following information from other reliable sources:</p>
<p>Changchun is not openly occupied by the Communist army, but the mayor and the chief of public security are both inclined to the Eighth Route Army. Neither of the two are Communists, nor are they military officers. The Communist army has appointed a new mayor, but he has not yet taken office. In recent days, public sentiment has greatly stabilized because Chongqing has announced that it has reached an agreement with the Soviet Union on takeover arrangements.</p>
<p>The first group of Central personnel to arrive in Changchun were warmly welcomed by the people, who eagerly inquired when the National Army would arrive. Chongqing has already screened films about the situation in Changchun. November 7 was the anniversary of the Soviet Revolution, and Soviet Commander Malinovsky hosted a banquet to entertain the Chinese delegation, with many speeches focusing on Sino-Soviet friendship. Two days later, the Chinese delegation reciprocated, and on November 12, the Ministry of Communications and the Post Office were taken over and transferred to the Central Government's management. At this time, relations between the two sides were quite tense due to the Yingkou incident. The Communist army entered Yingkou after the Soviet army withdrew and fired at U.S. transport ships carrying landing National Army soldiers.</p>
<p>It is rumored that Xiong Shihui returned to Chongqing with some of the Soviet side's demands or handover conditions, but this has not been confirmed. According to the Beiping Yishi Bao, the Soviet army had already begun to withdraw from Changchun in accordance with the Sino-Soviet Treaty, but at this time ordered 20,000 troops to return to Changchun to maintain order. Most of the nine eastern provinces are now under the control of the Communist army. Of the seven newspapers in Changchun, six have been taken over by the Eighth Route Army, and the radio station is also under the jurisdiction of the Communist army. It is said that 40,000 to 60,000 Japanese soldiers were not disarmed and fled to northern Jilin Province to confront the Communist army, but this has not been confirmed. Japanese residents in the Northeast and most of the disarmed Japanese soldiers are waiting quietly to be sent back to their country. It is said that both Britain and the Soviet Union are paying close attention to the diplomatic situation, and this concern is very helpful to the National Government. The takeover personnel who withdrew from Changchun are still staying here, waiting for the opportunity to return to their posts.</p>
<h3>Shi Zhiren Reports: Traffic Conditions</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Beiping, 24th] Shi Zhiren, a special commissioner of the Ministry of Communications, went to Tianjin from Beiping today. According to him, the Beining Railway's eastbound traffic has passed Yuguan and reached Suizhong, and the Pingcheng Railway is open to Miyun. It is reported that a large number of bandits are entrenched north of Miyun, causing disturbances and harassing the area along the way. As of the 16th, more than 100 of our personnel had died. The Pingsui Railway is open to Nankou in the east, and the Pinghan Railway is open to Shijiazhuang. However, two piers of the Hutuo River bridge have been destroyed by bandits, and the Xinle River bridge has been repaired and opened to traffic. Where it has been destroyed by bandits, it is still necessary to walk for communication. Two places between Tianjin and Tangshan have been destroyed by bandits. The Jinpu Railway is open to Cangxian, and the section between Dexian and Jinan is being repaired urgently. The section between Xuzhou and Bengbu is open to traffic, and the section between Xuzhou and Jinan is not open because of bandits entrenched in Zouxian, Tengxian, and Lincheng. The Jiaoji Railway is open between Qingdao and Jinan. The Pinghan Railway is open between Zhengzhou and Hankou, and between Xinxiang and Zhangde. The Longhai Railway is open between Luoyang and Zhengzhou. The section between Zhengzhou and Zhongmou has been destroyed by bandits and is not open. The Weishan Bridge and Yangquan in the section between Shijiazhuang and Taiping on the Zhengtai Railway have been destroyed by bandits and cannot be opened to traffic. The engineering teams of the railway authorities are cooperating with the military's progress to repair the sections destroyed by bandits.</p>
<h3>Communist Troops Move from Hebei to Rehe; Another Route Fleeing West from Baotou Attempts to Disturb Western Sui</h3>
<p>[United Press Beiping, 24th] The Foreign Affairs Office of the 11th War Zone reported today that the Communist army is moving on a large scale from Hebei Province to Rehe, thus advancing parallel to the Central Army towards the Northeast. At the same time, some Communist troops are advancing along the Pingsui Railway towards Datong. It is said that since November 11, bandits from the Eighth Route Army have been moving north one after another towards Rehe. Whenever they pass through villages in Hebei, they forcibly collect grain from the farmers. Their route follows the highway through Sanhe, Xianghe, Yutian, and Fengzhen, all between Beiping and Shanhaiguan.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Guisui, 24th] Two groups of Communist troops, about 1,000 to 2,000 people, are fleeing west from the vicinity of Baotou. One group has fled to the Yingpan of the Western Gongqi of the Urat Front Banner, and the other has fled into the Taichong area in Anbei, with the intention of disturbing Western Sui.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Qingdao, 23rd] The Communist army in Shandong had a plan to try to obstruct the National Army's westward advance along the Jiaoji Railway. At 10:30 p.m. on the 23rd, the two strongest regiments, the 13th and 14th, of the Communist 5th Division, attacked a unit of the National Army Du Jian Dao's force, Wang Jiazhen's camp, stationed in Lancun. The National Army immediately deployed and dealt them a severe blow. After fierce fighting until 7:00 a.m. on the 22nd, the bandits were defeated and fled in disarray towards Mashan. In this battle, more than 400 bandits were killed or wounded, more than 170 bodies were abandoned, including many mid-level bandit leaders, and 13 bandits were captured. A number of Type 38 rifles were seized. The National Army suffered only two wounded. This was the first attack suffered by the National Army after arriving in Qingdao.</p>
<h3>Communist Troops in Southern Henan Increase Support and Cause Disturbances</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Kaifeng, 23rd] More than 8,000 troops of Li Xiannian's Communist army in southern Henan, with several artillery pieces attached, fled to the Sujiahe Qianjiapeng area on the 19th to cause disturbances and attack our local teams. At the same time, the Communist 117th Regiment greatly increased its support. After a day and night of fierce fighting, they are now occupying Doushahe.</p>
<h3>Lock Mow Kes and Others Visit Chairman Chiang in Chongqing to Discuss the Situation in the Northeast</h3>
<p>[United Press International Chongqing, 24th] Major General Lock, commander of the U.S. Marine Corps 3rd Amphibious Force, and Major General Wootton came to Chongqing from Shanghai today to pay their respects to Chairman Chiang. According to reliable sources, Chairman Chiang has, in the past few days, discussed the situation in North China and the Northeast, and related international issues, with U.S. 7th Fleet Commander Barbey, U.S. Assistant Secretary of the Navy Gates, and Truman's representative on the Japanese Reparations Committee, Pauley. Well-informed sources said that Chairman Chiang and Major General Lock will continue to discuss the above issues. It is also learned that Gates, Pauley, Barbey and others left Chongqing yesterday.</p>
<p>[United Press International Chongqing, 24th] Truman's envoy on Japanese reparations, Pauley, U.S. Assistant Secretary of the Navy Gates, and Rear Admiral Lysons have completed their inspection here and flew to Okinawa today. Gates will go to Manila, and Pauley will return to Tokyo.</p>
<h3>We Organize Committee to Take Over US Supplies Left in China-India-Burma</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Chongqing, 24th] In order to take over the supplies left by the U.S. military in China, India, and Burma, the Executive Yuan specially ordered the four ministries of military affairs, finance, economy, and communications, the Production Bureau, the Transportation Management Bureau, the Aviation Commission, the Health Department, and the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, to each send representatives to jointly organize a committee to be responsible for handling the matter. It is learned that the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has appointed Chief Technician Hua Fengxiang as its representative.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Chongqing, 24th] It is learned that some of the U.S. military's surplus materials have been sold to the China Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, part of which will be shipped to Shanghai to be used for relief in our country. The materials shipped include barley, flour, medical supplies, food, clothing, vehicles, building materials, and raw materials, totaling approximately 50,000 tons.</p>
<h3>U.S. Military Appoints Special Committee to Assist in Suppressing Prices in This City; General Wedemeyer Expresses Determination Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] General Wedemeyer, Commander of the U.S. Forces in China (pictured), hosted reporters at the Shanghai base headquarters of the Construction Building yesterday, accompanied by General Stratemeyer. General Wedemeyer gave detailed answers to the questions raised by the reporters, especially regarding the prices in Shanghai, firmly expressing the need to suppress them. General Wedemeyer declared that there are unscrupulous merchants in this city who are taking advantage of the opportunity to raise prices and defraud U.S. military personnel. I have already taken effective measures for this matter and have appointed a special committee to discuss reasonable principles for handling it. If the general merchants still cannot take care of commercial ethics and continue to raise prices in an illegal manner, the headquarters will take decisive measures, strictly prohibiting the U.S. military from trading with them, and adding a statement that these measures do not contain any intention of intimidation, but rather express the U.S. military's determination to suppress prices. The following are the answers to the reporters' questions:</p>
<p>Considering Allocating Ships to Help Us Transport Troops to the Northeast</p>
<p>(1) The Chinese authorities have allocated many ships to the government in order to transport troops to the Northeast, and the U.S. government is considering this. The Chinese side has not yet announced whether to land in Huludao and Yingkou. (2) In the Northeast—including the area north of Shanhaiguan—the United States currently has not a single soldier stationed. Since the Soviet Union joined the war against Japan on August 8, the U.S. military has withdrawn all its intelligence personnel, and the Northeast has also been incorporated into the Soviet war zone and is not under the jurisdiction of the Chinese Theater Command. Therefore, all issues in the Northeast are now directly negotiated by China and the Soviet Union. (3) The entire U.S. military policy in China must be decided by the U.S. government. My job is to implement the policy, not to establish it. General Wedemeyer continued: As of now, the U.S. government has not instructed to withdraw the U.S. military from North China.</p>
<p>Lend-Lease Materials Continue to be Delivered to Our Government</p>
<p>(4) The contract for the supply of materials and the fitting out of the Chinese army under the Lend-Lease Act still exists. The current instructions of the U.S. government are to continue to deliver the materials that have already been shipped and are en route to the Chinese Central Government. According to the provisions of the contract, the U.S. should equip 39 divisions of the Central Army. Twenty divisions have been equipped and trained, and the remaining 19 divisions are currently being equipped. General Wedemeyer continued: Zhou Enlai mentioned in Chongqing that the U.S. would equip 70 divisions of the Central Army, but this is a misunderstanding. (5) The U.S. authorities originally had a plan to assist China in establishing a new army, navy, and air force, but they have not yet received formal instructions on organizing a military advisory group.</p>
<p>Sending Japanese Prisoners of War Back to Their Country, Only 3,000 Can Be Shipped Back Each Day</p>
<p>(6) Regarding the repatriation of Japanese prisoners of war, under the current circumstances, the transportation tools available to the U.S. authorities can only ship back 3,000 people per day. By the end of this month, the U.S. military should be able to repatriate 35,000 Japanese prisoners of war. According to U.S. military statistics, there are 500,000 Japanese prisoners of war in the area north of Shanhaiguan and south of the Yellow River. If all of them are to be repatriated, it will take at least six to eight months. Also, General MacArthur said that if his duties in Japan are slightly less busy in the short term, he plans to visit China.</p>
<h3>Unifying the Allocation of Ships; Establishing a New Organization</h3>
<p>Liu Hongsheng and Lu Zuofu to Preside</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper Chongqing, 24th] The Ship Allocation Committee will be established on the 1st of next month to unify the command of Changjiang (Yangtze River) vessels for military and civilian use, with Liu Hongsheng and Lu Zuofu serving as chairman and vice-chairman respectively. They will work within the Ministry of Communications. A chairman's office will be established separately in Shanghai, to be headed by Xu Xueyu, with offices set up in Yichang, Hankou, Nanjing, Tianjin, and Qingdao. The original Ship Management Office of the Logistics Department, the Water Transport Administration of the Wartime Transportation Bureau, and the Changjiang Reinstatement Committee will all be abolished. It is also reported that the Minlian ship left Chongqing at 6:30 a.m. on the 22nd.</p>
<h3>Our Scientists Invent a New Treatment for Stomach Ulcers</h3>
<p>[United Press International New York, 23rd] New York University Medical School has, after many years of research, invented a new treatment for stomach ulcers. It is said that it can relieve the patient's pain within four hours. The inventor is Dr. Guo Tai (transliteration), a Chinese scientist. His method is to feed the patient a pre-digested protein "Amikeen." After two or three weeks, when checked with X-rays, the symptoms disappear.</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang to Announce Economic Measures to be Adopted by the Government Tomorrow</h3>
<p>We Notify the United States of Approval of International Monetary Agreement</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Chongqing, 24th] It is learned that Chairman Chiang will make an important announcement on the afternoon of the 26th of this month (Monday) regarding the current economic situation in the country and the measures the government plans to take.</p>
<p>[United Press International Washington, 23rd] Treasury Secretary Vinson announced today that the Chinese Embassy has notified the State Department that the country has approved the Bretton Woods Monetary Agreement. The approver is China, second only to the United States. The agreement provides for the stabilization of international currencies and the establishment of an international bank to assist in reconstruction. The agreement must be signed by 65 percent of the participating countries to take effect.</p>
<h3>Northwest Teachers Arrive 2</h3>
<p>— Fang Canglang</p>
<p>3.  Writing about Kazakhs in a Blessed Land</p>
<p>Today, the so-called Kazakh issue, whether considered from the perspective of race, history, or geographical environment, can all prove that this is merely a domestic matter among the northwestern branches of the Chinese nation, and is absolutely not a minority ethnic issue. Looking back at ancient history, the Kazakh people are actually the descendants of the Kangju people of the Han Dynasty. One group of mixed-race people have been nomadic in Central Asia for a long time, and their descendants have forgotten their ancestors, claiming that the Kazakhs are the same as the Kyrgyz people of Central Asia. According to my personal investigations in Gansu and Xinjiang provinces recently, the distribution area of ​​pure Kazakhs is in Yili, Tacheng, Qitai, Usu, Zhenxi, Yanqi, and Dihua, with a population of 500,000. There are more than 100,000 in the area bordering Xinjiang and Mongolia and the undetermined borders between China and the Soviet Union. Since 1938 (Republic of China year 27), less than 20,000 Kazakhs have migrated from Zhenxi to the Hexi region of Gansu and within Qinghai Province. According to Jin Zaiye, the commissioner of the Qinghai-Kangding border region of the Military Commission, there are now also a small number of Kazakhs in Tibet, numbering less than 500. The skin color of the Kazakhs is light black with a slightly reddish tinge, they are hairy and plump, and their physique is great, different from the Tibetans. Their language and writing are slightly similar to the Hui people. Very few are literate, and illiteracy accounts for 90%. The Kazakhs began to believe in Islam from the 16th century. They gradually like to use Chinese surnames. They are skilled in riding and shooting and love to eat smoked meat. They live in wind and sand all year round, are naturally wild and unrestrained, do not understand what laws are, and looting has become a common practice. They need education and do not understand what is called "autonomy". Saying that they also want "autonomy" is really like the sign opposite the Grand Theater, "Heaven Knows".</p>
<p>When I visited the leaders of the Kazakhs who had surrendered in Hexi, Hu Shekusman and his partner, I told them in detail about the government's concern for the lives of the Kazakh people in Zhangye, Jiuquan, and Dunhuang, and the news of providing them with food and cash, as well as many Kazakh women waiting for news inside and outside. They were moved to tears. They have been able to understand that giving them weapons is not necessarily an act of "benevolence." They reverently looked at a portrait of Chairman Jiang hanging on the wall and said to me in the Hui language: "This big official is bigger than Chief Zhu, and even more benevolent."</p>
<p>4.  Hexi Today</p>
<p>Hexi is the corridor of the Gansu-Xinjiang passage, shaped like a wasp waist on the map. Qinghai and Ningxia are on its two sides. The four prefectures of Hexi established during the Han Dynasty under Emperor Wu, the four great cities of Wuwei, Zhangye, Jiuquan, and Dunhuang, have all become important hubs of the Gansu-Xinjiang road today. It is now under the jurisdiction of the sixth and seventh administrative inspectorates of Gansu, governing a total of sixteen counties and one establishment bureau. Jiuquan County has a population of only 140,000, the land is barren, the people are poor, and water conservancy needs to be developed. The food that the common people earn from hard work throughout the year is difficult to make ends meet after deducting various burdens. When the army passes through and there is not enough vegetables, in the extremely difficult areas of Anxi, Jinta, and Dingxin, the common people almost take out the only dish of vegetables they have left to help the army without any complaints. Most of them have not received education. In these three counties, I only met two high school graduates, but their patriotic enthusiasm is no less than that of the southeast. Their markets are still based on the barter system of ancient times. In the countryside of Jinta, it is rare to see banknotes. There is neither hoarding nor speculation there. The suffering that the people of Hexi have endured over the years, and the importance of the Hexi region, are well known to people with a little geographical knowledge. I observed Hexi for two months. I saw that this year's wheat harvest in Hexi was not bad, averaging more than 70%. The quality of wheat is particularly good. In Gaotai and Zhangye, every hundred catties of wheat can be ground into ten more catties of flour. Water conservancy projects in Hexi, such as the Yuanyang Pond west of Jiuquan and the Sanqing Canal in Gaotai County, have been successfully built. The Sanqing Canal has recently been completed and has started releasing water. However, apart from this, the construction of water conservancy has not yet reached the ideal stage. The reservoir in the Qilian Mountains must be built, but it has not been built yet because of lack of funds and difficulty in obtaining materials.</p>
<p>Speaking of water conservancy in Hexi, one cannot help but think of transportation in the northwest. The focus of Gansu's construction is "water conservancy first" and "transportation first." Water conservancy work is already underway, and we are temporarily looking forward to it, but when it comes to the current state of transportation, it is much worse. During the tenure of Director He Jingwu of the Northwest Highway Bureau, it is said that he devoted all his efforts to "military affairs first," so now there are roads but no cars, and cars, though available, stop from time to time. Before August, there were no scheduled buses in Hexi, and it is hard to say now. Postal transport also has to rely on animal power. The distance from Lanzhou to Liangzhou (Wuwei) is 200 kilometers, and a car can reach it in one day, but the delivery of newspapers and letters often takes a week. Letters sent to the west of Jiayuguan will of course take dozens of days.</p>
<p>On the way back east from Hexi, I was very fortunate to meet Mr. Ju Juesheng and Mr. Fan Songfu in Zhangye. Mr. Ju came to see the current state of justice in the northwest and took the opportunity to travel to Hexi. Mr. Fan came to inspect military discipline. My welcoming words to the two gentlemen were only four words: "You've come at the right time." Later, thanks to Mr. Ju's consideration, he asked me several times about my impressions of Hexi. My frank report was as follows: "The most urgent task in Hexi is to increase production, but poor farmers pawn their farm tools, and the monthly interest they bear reaches 200 per thousand. To increase production, water conservancy must be planned first, but unfortunately, most of the water conservancy workers are idle. Politics is improving, transportation still needs effort, and the power of the gentry is greater than everything. The entire budget of the county health center is so small that it is not even as much as the personal expenses of a doctor, so the people are still sick."</p>
<h3>Nanjing Massacre – Investigation to be Announced Soon – [Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th Dispatch]</h3>
<p>The Capital's Committee Investigating the Crimes of Japanese Invaders has been working diligently for the past month. A preliminary investigation has been completed and will be announced soon. This shocking crime of the Nanjing Massacre will be illustrated with the most reliable evidence, revealing its cruelty and madness. According to reports from the Red Swastika Society and the Chongshan Hall, they jointly organized five burial teams which worked continuously for over four months and buried 155,338 corpses of men, women, and children. This figure does not include burials by private teams. It is estimated that at least 200,000 of our compatriots were brutally murdered. Currently, the citizens of Nanjing are lodging dozens of accusations daily with the Crimes Investigation Committee against the Japanese invaders for rape, drowning, and torture.</p>
<p>Saturday Forum: Political Consultation Conference by Zhang Shizhao.</p>
<p>The Political Consultation Conference is established for the government and various factions to jointly determine national policies. However, the name of this conference, its regulations, the number of representatives, and the selection of personnel have remained unannounced for several months since its inception. Although there is news of a convening on the first of next month, it is uncertain when Zhou Enlai, the representative of the Chinese Communist Party, will fly to Yan'an and when he will return to the accompanying capital. Who can be certain? Alas, this conference is as difficult as assembling a Tangram puzzle! Nevertheless, the day of announcement is not the day of success. It is expected that the difficulties will be a hundredfold greater after the announcement. Some say, "Again and again, the government and the Chinese Communist Party consult and deliberate on all major military and political plans, and the framework has long been established outside the conference. At the conference table, they only supplement and repair it formally. What difficulty is there?" As for the various parties and non-party factions, they are like stage props, merely for decoration and of little importance. Therefore, this conference should either not be held at all, or if it is held, it will inevitably succeed. To assess the difficulty and then plan accordingly is no different from the worries of the man of Qi who feared the sky would fall. This is what I doubt.</p>
<p>The origin of this conference lies in the Communist Party's lack of restraint. However, the Communist Party's lack of restraint is in military matters, not political matters. Seeking military power, there is military strength, and in politics, there is political power. If military strength can determine the world, then the government, like Yu the Great taming dragons, could drive out the Communist Party and be done with it. Why rely on this conference? This conference is to address the imbalance of political power, which military strength cannot. Speaking of political power, the Communist Party can only represent a small part of the public opinion of the whole people, while the various parties and non-party factions represent a larger number, yet the larger number seems powerless. Even if the government does not harbor any intention of entrusting power, it seems to be yielding before yielding. From now on, the Communist Party will use the various parties to assert itself, and the latter will attach themselves to the former to make themselves seen. Their intention seems to be, "Only when the Communist Party is in chaos does the government realize the presence of the various parties. Otherwise, in the past twenty years, where has there been any spark of public opinion to be expressed?" This is merely a case of Zhao and Meng vying for importance. I have long lamented this.</p>
<p>I have long advocated national harmony through reconciliation, but reconciliation, as a concept, will inevitably fail if not implemented with genuine spirit. Conferences of this kind, which have been convened and failed throughout history, both in China and abroad, are too numerous to count. The Estates-General in France are a prominent example. The Estates comprised three orders: the nobility, the clergy, and the commoners. In the time of Louis XVI, these three estates represented the entirety of France. After the French Revolution, the nation's politics became unstable, resembling the chaotic situation in China since the Xinhai Revolution. Therefore, in 1787, the Declaration of the Parliament of Paris proposed the Estates-General for consultation to consolidate the foundation of the nation, which is somewhat similar to our current conference using the Political Participation Council as its basis. However, Louis XVI initially favored the first two estates to suppress the commoners, then gradually used the commoners to curtail the first two estates. The three estates were mutually hostile, manipulated without restraint, ultimately leading to a great disaster. Following the ill fate of Louis' dynasty, it ended as an empty historical relic. This is because the true meaning of reconciliation was lost.</p>
<p>Based on public concerns and clear historical examples, I propose three points for consideration: First, the government must recognize the true strength of the entire nation and use sincerity and openness as the cornerstone of the conference. Do not treat it lightly, allowing it to succeed or fail, merely viewing this conference as a hyphen and seeking its meaning elsewhere. Second, the Communist Party must lay down its arms and show genuine patriotism to the world. The strength of its military should not determine the value of this conference. Third, the various parties and non-party figures should act with utmost sincerity, uphold independent views, not be cat's paws for others, nor be at the back of the ox, belittling themselves and burdening the nation. With these three principles clarified, the conference can be successfully held. If any one of them is not fulfilled, it is better not to hold it. Not only should the French Estates-General serve as a warning, but also the failed National Crisis Conference in Luoyang in the past is not far behind.</p>

<p>UN Agency Preparatory Committee General Assembly Opens Yesterday – British Representative Speaks Strongly Advocating Control of Atomic Energy – [Reuters, London, 24th Dispatch]</p>
<p>The United Nations Preparatory Committee held its first meeting today. The British representative, Baker, criticized the pessimists who have recently become active again. Baker said, "I feel comforted that our work will not be achieved in a moment." The work of the Preparatory Committee is to review and adopt the recommendations decided upon by the Executive Committee, composed of fourteen countries, after ten weeks of intensive work. All fifty-one member states attended today, and the meeting was virtually a general assembly of a United Nations agency. Baker said, "I deeply believe that the United Nations can meet the test of the times, and other countries also believe that the British people are determined not to let this effort fail again." Today, more than one country fears the recurrence of war. It is highly inappropriate for anyone to say that some governments are still willing to start wars or are even preparing for war. Governments have already switched from wartime production to peacetime production. No nation in the world, especially its government, can start a war again." Baker then described the urgent tasks of the first United Nations General Assembly, saying, "Governments must do some work for their people regarding science. Aviation, which was invented 44 years ago, has been cursed by humanity. If atomic energy is not controlled, it will exterminate mankind. This is a human invention and must be controlled by humans." "Our government should establish an organization through the United Nations agency, gather the efforts of great individuals, and make atomic energy serve humanity instead of destroying it. May the institutions we plan to establish forever eliminate the crimes of war." The Soviet representative, Gromyko, suggested, and the Bolivian representative, Salamanca, seconded, to postpone the meeting until next Monday to give the representatives sufficient time to consider the agenda. Later, during the Executive Committee's discussion of the draft agenda, the Brazilian Ambassador to Britain, Valler, was elected Chairman.</p>
<p>Second Day of Foreign Policy Debate – Highlights of British Foreign Secretary's Speech – Determined to Establish Peace by Engaging with All Countries on a Foundation of Justice and Strengthening the United Nations – [Central News Agency Reporter Ren Lingsun, 23rd, London Dispatch]</p>
<p>The British House of Commons continued its debate on foreign policy this afternoon. British Foreign Secretary Bevin attended and delivered a speech outlining international relations, listing three main points: (1) The British government will adhere to the principle of engaging with all countries, large and small, on a just basis. (2) Only frankness can eliminate international suspicion. (3) The British government firmly believes that the United Nations is the instrument for laying the foundation for international security. Britain is prepared to strengthen the power of the United Nations and hopes to see this new organization continue to develop into a true world assembly with international law as its pillar and a world police force to enforce this international law. In addition, Bevin also touched on other issues. Regarding the atomic bomb issue, he believed that since the first General Assembly of the United Nations is scheduled to convene in January next year, there is no need to hold a special meeting to consider the atomic bomb proposals jointly drafted by Attlee, Truman, and King. He believed that the Security Council, once established, will consider the proposals for establishing an atomic energy commission.</p>
<p>Far Eastern Advisory Committee – Decides to Send Personnel to Japan – To Conduct On-Site Observations – [Central News Agency, Washington, 23rd Dispatch]</p>
<p>The Far Eastern Advisory Committee decided this afternoon to send personnel to Japan soon to consult with MacArthur and conduct "on-site" observations. An official spokesperson said that they could depart within two or three weeks, and that it would be a mistake to assume that they would resolve the various complex issues related to controlled Japan in a purely academic manner. Therefore, the Committee decided to send personnel to visit Japan. The Committee meeting today lasted for two hours, reviewing economic documents prepared by the China-America-Australia subcommittee. After careful consultation, the meeting made revisions and passed it. The next meeting of the Committee will discuss a report on general policy and orders issued by the Allied occupation forces regarding the economy.</p>
<p>De Gaulle Announces Policy Outline – French Parliament Trusts Government – [Reuters, Paris, 24th Dispatch]</p>
<p>After General de Gaulle announced his policy outline to Parliament yesterday, Parliament immediately passed a vote of confidence in De Gaulle's new government amid cheers. In his policy outline, De Gaulle vowed that France would be the link between East and West, but under no circumstances would it become a political box (in chess). The government is currently working to harmonize the policies of Britain and France, renegotiate treaties between France and Italy, and prepare to restore close relations with democratic Spain. De Gaulle then announced that credit, lending, electrical power, and insurance would be nationalized and that reforms of administration, public affairs, justice, and national defense have been submitted to Parliament as a bill for a vote.</p>
<p>Investigation of the Attack on Pearl Harbor – Former Secretary of State Hull Testifies the Day Before Yesterday – [Reuters, Washington, 24th Dispatch]</p>
<p>Former Secretary of State Hull told the Congressional Committee investigating Pearl Harbor that in the final, tense days of diplomatic negotiations in 1941, he did not consider the possibility of a Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. He also said that during the Atlantic Conference held by Churchill and President Roosevelt that summer, when the Atlantic Charter was drafted, Churchill stated that Britain would need a long time to prepare before engaging in military action in the Pacific. However, after the President returned to Washington, he told the Japanese ambassador that if Japan did not stop its aggression, the United States would take self-defense measures. Hull also defended himself and President Roosevelt, saying that the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor was not caused by American provocation. Although he had warned Roosevelt and others that the Japanese military might attack at any time and in any place, the initial focus of the American military remained in the Western Pacific. Hull has detailed records of the US-Japan negotiations, which can prove that he and President Roosevelt worked hard to prevent the Japanese militarists from engaging in aggressive behavior in Asia.</p>
<p>Trial of Japanese War Criminals Postponed – [United Press, Washington, 24th Dispatch]</p>
<p>The Department of the Army announced today that the trial of Japanese war criminals, including Tojo, has been postponed due to international relations.

<p>Japanese Atomic Experiment Facility – Thoroughly Destroyed by Allied Forces – Ten Years of Effort Come to Nothing – Dr. Nishina Witnessed with Grief – [United Press, 24th Dispatch]</p>
<p>The Nishina Laboratory, affiliated with the Tokyo Institute of Physical and Chemical Research, which has a 300-ton American-made cyclotron, has now learned that MacArthur has ordered the device to be destroyed today. After this, Japan will be unable to research atomic energy or manufacture atomic bombs. Four other small cyclotrons have also been ordered to be destroyed by MacArthur. It is unknown whether this action was authorized by Washington. In addition, the two Nishina cyclotrons at Kyoto and Osaka Imperial Universities were also destroyed and dumped into the sea. Nishina is Japan's most renowned atomic physicist. It is said that the destruction of this enormous cyclotron is extremely unfortunate. He told his secretary, Yokoyama, "The destruction of this device means that my ten years of effort have come to nothing. I don't know what to do now, but I will continue to study cosmic rays."</p>
<p>Research History</p>
<p>Japan's research on atomic energy was six years behind the United States. If sufficient resources had been available, the now-destroyed cyclotron could have produced enough atomic energy to manufacture an atomic bomb within a year. Compared to those in the United States, the cyclotrons in Nishina's laboratory were insignificant. However, if they had not been destroyed, they could have been donated to other countries for research purposes. Nishina began researching atomic energy in 1935, initially using a 23-ton electromagnet as the base for the cyclotron, but it was unsuitable. Between 1937 and 1938, Nishina obtained a 220-ton electromagnet from the atomic energy equipment of the radiation laboratory at the University of California, and then actively began to research atomic energy.</p>
<p>Original Slant Lack</p>
<p>Professor Lawrence, the inventor of the cyclotron and one of the manufacturers of the atomic bomb, provided various forms of assistance to Nishina's research. In 1941, Nishina and his colleagues considered mass-producing atomic energy, known as "U-235," but the Japanese military knew nothing of the importance of atomic energy, and there was also a lack of sufficient potassium for application, so it was abandoned. After Hiroshima and Nagasaki were bombed with atomic bombs, Japanese scientists resumed their enthusiastic research on atomic energy. Nishina also said that he had 22 pounds of uranium and originally thought of separating it by diffusion, but unfortunately, the laboratory with this type of equipment was destroyed by American aircraft during an air raid. Although all the buildings in Nishina's laboratory were destroyed, the one housing the cyclotron remained intact, which was also a coincidence.</p>
<p>One Basket</p>
<p>Because the device was too large, it was placed on the lowest floor of the building. Although the United States knew that Japan had a cyclotron, it did not know the extent to which it had been researched. Before issuing the order, MacArthur sent people to Nishina's laboratory on the 20th of this month to search for all records relating to the cyclotron to prevent them from being lost. According to the head of the physics department at Kyoto Imperial University, Japan only became interested in atomic energy at the end of 1944. At the beginning of 1945, the Naval Ordinance Bureau asked him if he could manufacture an atomic bomb. He replied that he could not. In June of this year, the Navy gave him 16 boxes of uranium and instructed him to continue his research, but Japan soon surrendered, and the sixteen boxes of sleeves have not yet been used.</p>
<p>Education and Sports – In the Voice of Correcting the "Japanization" Style – A Total Mobilization of the National Language in Taiwan Province – Unanimous Promotion in Military, Political, and Police Aspects – [Our Newspaper, Taipei, 23rd, Air Mail]</p>
<p>The movement to reform the "Japanized" style in Taiwan Province has gradually begun. Many stores have changed their business associations to company names and switched from speaking Japanese to speaking Mandarin.

<p>Academization of Educational Administration by Chen Xuanshan</p>
<p>Academization of educational administration is not a high-sounding term, nor is it the talk of bookworms, but it is something that can and should be done practically. The so-called academization of educational administration at least includes two meanings: The first meaning is that the handling of all administrative work should be based on a research attitude. The most fearful thing in administrative work is mechanization and routine. If everything is done according to precedents and one is spinning around in "etc., etc.," there will never be progress. Educational work should be "new every day." When dealing with something, one should always ask "Why do we do it?" "Why do we do it this way?"</p>
<p>To give a few simple examples: Now all agencies hold memorial weeks. We should ask "Why do we hold memorial weeks?" "How can we fulfill the original mission of memorial weeks?" "How can memorial weeks have a positive impact on the work of the participants?" Similarly, when holding entrance examinations, we should ask "Why do we hold entrance examinations?" "What impact will the entrance examination have on students?" "What possible malpractices are there in the entrance examination, and how can these malpractices be avoided?" If we can use this research capacity to handle administrative work, then all undertakings will have hope of improvement, and people who handle administration can also increase their interest in work.</p>
<p>I think the first thing people who handle administrative work should not do is be "messy," and the second thing they should not do is be "too busy." If they are too busy, they will easily be "messy." It is said that "busyness" has a relationship. Everyone should have plenty of special questions, a research attitude, and a clear mind to think about everything.</p>
<p>The second point is that educational administrative work must not be a one-way command from top to bottom. In many things, we should solicit and accommodate the opinions of colleagues, discuss and study together before making a decision. In this way, people who participate in the opinion, no matter their position, feel that they have a share in the decision, and their interest in work is invisibly increased. If the people above act arbitrarily, the people below can only mechanically execute orders, gradually developing a habit of reliance and perfunctoriness, the so-called "not seeking merit but seeking no demerit," then all undertakings will be lifeless and there will be no progress.</p>
