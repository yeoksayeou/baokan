<h3>利用呂宋島天險　日守軍奮勇殲敵　仁牙因灣海面一敵艦炸沉</h3>
<p>菲律賓前綫基地十四日中央社電　侵入仁牙因灣之敵軍，於十二，十三兩日，曾繼續在仁牙因正面及聖法比安地區，積極將戰車及車輛卸陸，登陸敵軍雖有南下企岡，然呂宋島戰况，敵未呈活潑化。日軍特別攻擊隊乘敵軍逡巡之際，續行突擊，十二日該特攻隊出動於仁牙因灣海面，轟炸敵空母或運輸之大型艦船一艘，而予以炸沉。</p>
<p>東京十三日中央社電　呂宋之敵軍以步兵二師團戰車一師團左右之兵力，在仁牙因灣頭聖法此安至仁牙因一帶登陸，目下正拼命確保橋頭堡。敵軍登陸企圖切斷至馬尼刺市之公路，制壓呂宋島平原，其在呂宋島仁牙　登陸點，企圖向呂宋平原推進，在呂宋島戰略地勢上，一見即明。呂宋地勢北部一帶乃險峻山岳地帶，大兵力難於施展，呂宋島東岸一帶乃陝隘平原，不適用於決戰，呂宋南部乃一平原地帶，可展開大兵力，而大規模之機動作戰，必須信中於呂宋中央平原，呂宋島西岸一帶自五月至十月多雨，現在爲乾燥季節，敵利用此點，此地帶有阿古諾河等多數河川，縱橫流貫，故雖謂平原，亦非平坦之大平原也。呂宋平原之戰，決不能忽視河流，敵軍爲攻擊呂宋平原，必須以水陸兩用戰車爲主。日軍戡定呂宋時，所擊破者乃菲律賓兵編成之美菲軍，此乃雜軍，故一舉殲滅，僅一星期即得完全制壓呂宋平原以進入馬尼刺，今日軍之作戰能力，足使敵軍恐懼。敵美此次作戰，乃大東亞戰爭開始以來最初之大規模陸上決戰，且該方補給路又極長遠，呂宋平原作戰，其認識日軍眞正實力，基於山下將軍强固作戰態勢，及注意環抱平原則面之山岳，當可知美軍作戰必受重創。</p>
<h3>中緬要衝畹町　日軍獲單果　稅布敵運輸車輛被炸</h3>
<p>緬甸某基地十四日中央社電　渝雲南遠征軍企圖攻取中緬國境要衝畹町，自去年末即在東北方地區配置第十一集團軍五師，於西北地區配置第五十三軍全師，於兩方面開始攻擊，惟該方面日守軍發覺渝第五十三軍之主力第一百三十師及第一百十六師，自四日起竟企圖遮斷日軍後方，渡過龍川江，當時日軍得新銳部隊增援，在戰車部隊與野砲部隊掩護下，於六日拂曉自卡躭亞川出以先發制人之猛烈反攻，當將渝軍擊退。日軍一部隊更在龍川江實行渡河，刻仍在北方急追潰走之渝軍，又渝第十一集團軍自畹町東北方進攻，亦爲日軍擊退云。</p>
<p>緬甸前綫日軍基地十二日中央社電　日精銳戰鬥機曾於十一日在北緬稅布西方發現敵車輛羣，當即施以轟炸，使敵載重汽車三輛起火，並炸毀四輛，另一隊日機繼續向該地敵機塲轟炸，使陸上停放之敵機二架起火，日日機安返基地。</p>
<h3>呂宋登陸作戰　英將一員陣亡</h3>
<p>里斯本十四日中央社電　據倫敦電：英陸軍部日前宣布，藍姆斯丹上將已於本月六日在太平洋上美船指揮作戰時陣亡。按藍姆斯丹現年四十八歲，原任邱吉爾首相駐麥克沃塞司令部代表。</p>
<h3>華南日軍　迫近韶關</h3>
<p>渝粵省府遷離</p>
<p>廣州十三日中央社電　日大陸包團陣勢，今已遂漸迫進渝第七戰區之要城韶關。據當地消息；重慶廣東省政府主席李漢魂，最近將省政府各機關由韶關遷至東江上流之龍川，現渝第七戰區司令長官余漢謀仍留駐韶關。</p>
<p>里斯本十三日中央社電　據重慶電：中國戰區美軍　司令官維渠雅十二日宣稱：中國方面日軍雖因美軍已進入呂宋島，然仍大阻西進亦未可知，倘日軍得充分時間，則昆明甚至重慶亦將予以進攻，日軍至今仍具有强力之進攻能力也。</p>
<h3>大東亞各地　一週間戰況</h3>
<p>東京十四日中央社電　本週大東亞各方而主要戰况如次：</p>
<p>菲律賓方面</p>
<p>自九日至十三日間之三日，敵第二第三船團繼第一船團之後，向仁牙因灣强行登陸，其兵力的達三四師團，內有戰車部隊一師團，然目下僅聖法比安方面以戰車爲主力，此外敵自海岸至阿古諾河狹隘地區，佔據橋頭堡整備陣勢，其大規模之進攻態勢似未完成，對此日陸上部隊特予以猛烈反攻，故兩方遂展開激戰。同時日特攻隊及空軍亦全員出動，十一日聖法比安仁牙因間之二十公里海岸地區之小登陸用舟船二十餘艘，因迺日特攻隊猛攻。又敵登陸部隊因對日軍獨特之「夜間肉搏突擊」戰術，極度恐慌，乃於陣外佈以嚴密之警戒網，且加以多數軍犬參加警戒，然日軍仍奮勇突破其警戒網勇行突擊，而予敵軍以重創。又敵機動部隊自三四兩日來襲後，於東方海面附近蠶動，企圖遮斷日軍南方補給路，九日復有艦載機四百五十架及由中國大陸飛來之大型機同時來襲台灣。</p>
<p>馬里亞納方面</p>
<p>據外電傳敵空軍司令部業移至關島，敵軍對該島異常重視，因戰前即爲太平洋作戰之據點，故今後當更强化該島。</p>
<p>摩羅泰島</p>
<p>日軍刻仍繼續展開果敢之遊擊戰，擾亂敵陣，同時日空軍亦與此呼應，續行猛攻，自去年十一月四日至今年一月十日，日空軍於該方面收獲之戰果，計焚燒軍事設施百四十餘處，波及者四四處，焚毀飛機百五十三架，炸毀百二十八架，共計二百八一架，其他物資倉庫多處被炸毀。又塔里琚島日軍依然奮戰，於飛機塲附近及中央髙地附近，燃放照明彈續行砲擊，糜羅泰與塔里琚島日守軍對各該地敵軍繼續奮勇作戰，使敵基地不能充分發揮機能。然雷伊泰與明多羅島敵陸上機之推進，屢次加緊，雷伊泰島敵機的計四百架，桑霍塞敵機約計百架左右。</p>
<p>緬甸方面</p>
<p>（一）怒江地區渝雲南遠征軍七師團，自東方及北方來襲緬甸後方，尙有三師團待機中，渝新編第一軍之兩師，在南康附近之八莫機塲達五百之衆，但仍續次損失，日軍自一月六日起開始潰擊，刻仍激戰中。（二）伊洛瓦底江東岸地區，渝美混合軍的兩師，推進至莫羅拉巴孟邵廖北方約四十公里附近，正與日軍激戰中。（三）密芝那鐵路綫方面日軍，在綏播瓦城西北的六十公里蒙尾瓦瓦城西方六百公里西方之卡尼綫，邀擊渝第四集團軍之三師與第三十三集團軍之四師共計七師，日軍刻仍與之激戰中。（四）日溪方面敵軍自去年末以來，即自馬猶半島以機動艇艦在日溪方面逐次開始登陸，日空軍與陸上部隊曾對之施以猛攻，已予重創。尤其日軍曾於九日攻擊滿載兵員之敵船團，當即使敵大型巡洋艦兩艘起火，幷確實擊沉其一艘，轟沉其他用舟艇約三百噸。又日軍於十日更攻擊日溪地區，使其七處起火，並炸碎一處。</p>

<p>十一日上午曾有敵B29型機十五架來襲</p>
<h3>敵機襲名古屋　被擊落數架　台灣中南部亦遭空襲</h3>
<p>東京十四日中央社電　馬利亞納敵基地之B29型機的六十架，自十四日十二時許起的一小時半內，由近綫地區侵入中部，對名古屋地區投下燒夷彈及炸彈，嗣後即向南方遁走，日軍制空部隊當時極爲活躍，擊落敵機數架，且爲衆所目睹，詳細戰果目下正在調査中，因日軍邀擊部隊猛攻之故，敵之投彈均未正確，日方重要設施損失極輕微。</p>
<p>東京十四日中央社電　日台灣軍十四日下午二時五十分發表：本月十四日上午十時四十分頃，有自中國方面飛來之大型機約五十架，侵入本島中南部地方，投彈若干後，至下午一時頃遂次向西方海面退去，我方損害輕微</p>

<p>柏林十四日中央社電　海通社訊：西綫亞登之局勢依然屬於流動性，雙方均不願有長久之壕溝戰，陣地之改變極緩而地段亦小。星期五德軍之突出點，已移至維爾薩姆之南·拉洛許之東。美第一軍在薩爾姆區之攻擊，進展甚微，英加軍由北及東之攻擊，與德軍之撤退速度相等。美第三軍由南部巴斯托納。維爾茲之進攻，已獲突破之効，德軍已予反攻。亞爾薩斯反軸心軍反攻已漸恢復共主動，並阻德軍在比許以南之攻擊。</p>
<p>里期本十四日中央社電　據前綫消息：傳西綫德軍業已開始使用長距離火箭式大砲，不斷轟擊美第三軍駐屯地，該火箭式大砲與十二月中旬對美第三第九兩軍所發射者同</p>

<h3>東綫蘇軍發動　冬季大攻勢</h3>
<p>瑞典京城十四日中央社電　蘇軍之冬季攻勢，已由第一烏克蘭軍十二日在南部波蘭展開。德軍當局對於蘇軍之此次攻勢極爲重視，甚至謂開始作戰之一月十二日，將成爲名垂靑史之一日。據德軍當局推定，參加攻勢之哥納夫之兵力，共爲步兵三軍二十四乃至二十八個師，且有戰車部隊。</p>
<p>柏林十四日中央社電　德國社訊：德軍預料中之蘇軍大攻勢，今已達於最髙潮。蘇軍十二日開始之維斯杜拉河橋頭堡大攻勢，到十三日上午復向東普魯土區擴大，於百餘公里之戰綫上，現已展開具有決定意義之大規模戰鬥。相信蘇軍之一切，將因此攻勢作戰而決定。巴拉諾橋頭堡之蘇軍目標，目在西里西亞無疑，於東普魯士方面則遙指哥尼斯堡作戰，區域似將更爲擴大。蘇軍於巴拉諾遭遇德軍抵抗，東普魯士蘇軍攻擊部隊早已發生大間隙。</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>三角戀愛中的宋子文</h3>
<p>自從中日事變演進爲大東亞戰爭之後，美渝和中共之間的戀愛關係，於是由曖昧而表面化了。敵美在太平洋上的反攻，企圖逼近日本本土。可是離自己本國更遠，要受到毀滅的危險，惟一解救的辦法，和在中國大陸上與日本決戰，遂圖制覇東亞的野心起見，只有利用已經有過交情和尙在好逑中的情人—渝共，要使這兩個情人都情願倒在自已懷裏，盡情嬉弄，那末，一箭雙鵬的辦法最好。兩個情人，戀愛一個男子，而各逢都懷了一種目的，自然勢必互相嫉妬，而鬥妍爭芳，媚態百出，各獻其　，以博取男子的寵愛，而抬髙身價。但是，爲了表示自己的髙貴，雖有求於嫖客，而不能逕自啓齒，就必須有一個爲雙方所信任的鴇母從中穿揷，同時，嫖客爲了在情人面前有所賣弄或監視她們另有外遇起見，也須有一個鴇母從中周旋。宋子文的上台，當行政院長，就是道種角色。</p>
<p>這樣比擬，也許太庸俗了一點，但是，較之吉田東佑先生用大文說明「宋子文入閣與重慶的苦悶」，或者要明快一些，較能適合中國人的理解力吧？吉田先生的見解很正確，我們完全贊同他的意見。不過，就我們中國人的立塲，對此問題，略加渝述，，未收有狗尾續貂之意。</p>
<p>這三角戀愛構成的中心，當然是重慶。因此，重慶是美渝共三者間的軸心。宋子文的上台，首先是反映重慶的態度，重慶的態度，是聯繫着美渝，渝共和共美的關係。</p>
<p>在沒有說明這三種關係以前，須先一述索子文與蔣介石的外交政策。正如吉田先生所說的一樣，宋子文是最適當當蔣家行政院長的人。他也早想登此實座，而始終被那位妹夫所疑忌。迂迂不得志的原因，就在他有能力與資格，而且周圍集合了一批當代俊彥之士，所以蔣明知孔祥熙貪庸無能，但無危險，易駕馭實過於宋。本來蔣介石的外交政策，一向是坐在「親日派」與「歐美派」的兩匹馬的車上。有的塲合，把前者放在前而，有的塲合，把後者放在前面。（借吉田先生語）但是，這匹「歐美派」的馬—宋子文，蔣始終沒敢好好的套在轅上，由他去拖他的馬車。現在美國人討厭這些驚駘，硬要換去，套上美化的宋子文，蔣介石爲了依賴美國，取信於美國，自然依順，而堂牠來拖危亡之境。</p>
<p>同時，美國爲要使重慶更能隨美國的心，必須在重慶政治中樞安置能聽命於美國，而能和緩政府與人民間的對立，使中國的人力物力能充分供其奴役和消耗。另一方面，須在戰爭中扶植能代表美國利益的傀儡，企圖在戰爭結束後，使中國變成美國的戰利品—殖民地，宋子文是最適當的角色。幾年來的秦養，就爲了這一着。</p>
<p>其次是渝其的關係。也和吉田先生所說的一樣，宋子文是自從抗戰以來對於中共相當理解的一個，這是事實。不過，「最受中共信任的政治家」一點，恐怕有待事實來證明。如果他也像孔祥熙一樣忠於蔣又忠於美，而忽略了中共的要求，或者妨碍到中共發展的時候，想中共不會厚於宋，而薄於孔吧？况凡中共的口的在「聯合政府」「聯合統帥部」，宋子文如以各黨各派之一的資格，參加這個集團，與中共同一政治的步調，則中共不會反對，能以統一戰綫中的同志相待。所以宋子文的長閣，現在還只能常作是孔祥熙的擋前牌，不能算是渝共間的和事佬。</p>
<p>其三是美共的關係。吉田先生在「國民黨改組與國共合作」一文中說：「……重慶軍隊與其說關心如何防範日本軍隊，毋寗說更加關心將來如何消滅中國共產黨軍隊。而中共軍隊固然關心如何擾亂日本軍隊，但更加關心在日本軍隊佔領的區域內部盡量擴充勢力範圍。：」這一段足以解釋美共勾結的關鍵了。美國不放心渝蔣，要中共去挾制渝蔣抗日。美國要圖戰爭的勝利，必須在中國找尋第二個力量，而且這個力量能配合在中國沿海登陸的妄想，那末，中共軍隊是最理想的。所以美國不能不承認中國共產黨政治力的存在，而勾結起來。</p>
<p>中國共產黨是着於運用辯證法中的矛盾與統一的。他們運用美渝間的矛盾，來統一共渝之問的矛盾，發展勢力範圍。再把美渝共間的矛盾，統一於「抗日」。宋子文就在這一點上，站了起來。</p>

<h3>今晨本市新舊市長　舉行交替儀式　新任秘書長各局長同時就職</h3>
<p>本市新舊市長交替，定於今日上午十時在市府大堂舉行，新任市畏周佛海，市府秘書長兼財政局局長羅君强，經濟局局長許江，公用局局長徐季敦等，即行接籙視事。交替儀式中，市府各局處長及髙級人員均將出席，十一時市警察局新舊交替，周兼局長正式視事。</p>
<p>周市長發表吿市民書</p>
<p>新任上海特別市市長兼保安司令周佛海，今（十五）日就職視事，發表「吿上海市民書」如下：</p>
<p>「上海市民諸君，在時局嚴重形勞緊張的時候，奉命來主持上海的市政，深深的感覺責任的重大，事業的艱巨，和環境的困難。所以就職之初，對我市民父老兄弟，略陳一些自己的所感和所信。</p>
<p>重担挑起來了</p>
<p>汪故主席遺柩回京的那一天，最髙國防會議開會，推戴陳先生爲代理主席，當天陳先生就對我說：「上海市的事，我不能兼顧了，只好請你去担任」。當時因爲自己的才力和精力，都不足以應付上海這樣複雜而困難的局面，所以婉詞謝絕了。我最好的朋友以及友邦的知好，都勸我不要幹，他們都本着愛護我的熱忱，不願使我到上海來犧牲，他們以爲上海的情形，今後祗有越加困難，越加惡劣，任何人來都不會有辦法，我何必身當其衝，身任其難，白白來作犧牲。他們的好意，我非常感謝。不過，我之所以不敢担任的，不是怕犧牲，在這樣的非當時期，那裏還能爲個人打算，我不敢担任，完全是因爲沒有辦法，所以上海市長的問題，一直拖延了四十多天，纔能決定，以後經陳代主席的令囑和同志的敦促，只好把這一副重担挑起來了。</p>
<p>負責保證兩點</p>
<p>旣然把這副重担挑起來，怎樣纔能完成所負的任務呢？我雖然日夜苦思焦慮，羣諮博採，但是得不到完滿的答案，聽說有許多人士，對我此來，懷着很大的期待，這更增加我的惶恐和焦急。我希望大家對我不要有甚麼期待，沒有期待，將來不會失望，期望越大，將來的失望就越甚，我不願意大家將來失望，所以請大家現在不必期待。這不是我推諉責任，也不是我妄自菲薄，更不是爲將來做不好的時候，預留口實，這樣的時局，這樣的環境，就是三頭六臂的天神下凡，也決不會有辦法，打開僵局，改善現狀，我這樣力薄能鮮，有什麽辦法可以實現大家的期待呢？不過我可以對市民諸君負責保證的有兩點：第一，我和我的幹部，這次抱着很大的決心來的，我們的決心，是「想做好」，不僅是「想」，而且本着苦幹，實幹，硬幹的精神去「做」。至於能不能「好」，雖然因爲時機環境和其他各種客觀的條件等關係，沒有充分的把握，但是我們一定竭心盡力，去運用時機，環境和其他條件，以盡我們可能盡的人事。我們不敷衍，不因循，不苟安，不辭勞怨，不打官腔，我們要切切實實的埋頭苦幹，希望盡最大的可能，爲市民謀多少福利，這是我可以向各位保證的第一點。</p>
<p>第二，我和我的幹部都是壯年有爲的，我們都是有理想的，我們都是有事業心的，我們的精神是公益重於私利，社會先於個人，我們絕對不會利用職權和地位，去謀個人的私利私益，我們明知在生活逼迫，人慾橫流，整個社會都腐敗墮落的時候，要樹立一種淸廉潔白的風氣，是不容易的事，但是我們本着陳代主席樹立廉潔政治的精神，決心以身作則，不貪贓，不枉法，不舞弊營私，不巧取豪奪。我們雖然不能一舉而做到弊絕風淸，但是一定要切切實實的去淸査整頓，希望盡最大的可能，爲市民减除多少痛苦，這是我可以向各位保證的第二點。</p>
<p>惡類決不姑息</p>
<p>此外古人說：「洽亂世，用重典。」不能除暴，就不足以安良，剝削人民的貪官，操縱市塲的奸商，擾亂闆閻的匪盜，對於這類人姑息，就是對於善良人民殘忍，對於爲非作歹的惡類敗類寬容，就是對於安分守已的良民暴虐。這類人，如果査獲他們作惡的確實證據，一定毫不姑息的予以嚴厲的處分，因爲我不願對於善良人民殘忍，所以我對於敗類惡類決不姑息和寬容，希望社會上的公正人士，以公正的態度，協助我調査和舉發。至於還有其他要做的事簡單的說，就是蕭規曹隨，上海市經陳前市長四年多的擘劃經營，事業已有基礎，行政巳上軌道，我今後所要做的事，就是陳前市長所巳做而尙宋完成以及想做而正要着手的事。我沒有新政策，沒有新計劃，我的政策和計劃，就是一貫的繼續陳前市長的理想和事業，使其逐步實現，遂步完成。</p>
<p>清除不當利益</p>
<p>我們要做事，所以不能顧情面，我們不管私，所以過去飽個人私囊的不當利益，我們要使之淸除，或使之歸公，因此我相信個人的情面，沒有得尊重，個人的私利沒有得繼續的一般人，一定會有反響，將來製造流言蜚語，甚至揑造事實，散發傳單的現象，一定是難免的，我們爲謀大多數人的福利，爲除大多數人的痛苦，這些少數因爲私人利益，淆亂是非的行動，我們不單毫不顧忌，而且査出主動的人，還要嚴厲的處分。不過遇到這些情形，希望各位要査淸事實，下以公正的判斷，不宜隨便輕信，致中奸人的詭計。</p>
<p>古人說：「卑之無甚髙論」，又說：「爲政不在多言，顯力行何如耳」。我在就職之初，不願陳議過髙，發出將來不能兌現的支票，也不願多發議論，徒作無謂的宣傳，能做到甚麽程度，就做到甚麽程度，將來拿行動和事實來向各位說明吧。</p>
<p>最後，要政令能够順利的推行，一定要市民能够了解和服從，如果政府與人民之間，沒有緊密的聯繫，政令是不易推行的，今後當盡量諮詢並採納各方的意見，同時對於政令的推行，很誠懇的希望市民諸君，予以充分的支持和協力。兼上海市市長兼上海市保安司令周佛海」</p>
<h3>物價評議會決定　統一管理物價　議定實施辦法六項</h3>
<p>本市物價評議會，鑒於邇來物價雖經該會評定，通令各業商人邀照出售，乃有一般商人，依舊任意髙抬，茲爲對於是項流弊，澈底取締，特經會議通過，對一般公定物價，置施統一管理，辦法內容如下：（一）査大餅，油條，切麵，粢飯，開水，棉花等項，前有配給原料，現該項原料均暫停配給，致須仰賴黑市，其價格日飛猛漲，公定限價遂無法執行，故必須對於需用原料，按期配給。（二）白報紙，化學工業原料，西藥原料等，大部來自外洋，大東亞戰爭爆發後，來源斷絕，市上現有交易者，均爲以前存貨，遂被投機商人，囤積居奇，售價遂暴騰髙漲，故計劃通令各該業公會，所有是項物資，均須依照中央規定，全部呈報登記，並實施交易市塲統一管理，除正當供給廠商作製造原料外，其餘一槪禁止買賣。（三）過去執行限價調査，均從各商號門市售價驚手，而遭受處分者，均爲零售商，然實際情形，均爲批發商先行坩加，因之零售商人，隨之上漲，經當局澈査處罰者，零售商無一遺漏，實際抬價之批發商，反得逍遙法外，實爲物價未能抑平之主要原因，故此後抑平物便，澈査執行限價，必須先從批發商着手，以收本原之效。（四）一般蔬菜攤販，大部散處馬路街邊，設立菜塲者，實居少數，致菜蔬限價管理無法統一，故必須呈睛市府，令飭衛生警察當局，將全市攤販，全部集中菜塲交易，並嚴令菜販，一例將所賣之物，於菜塲內，標明公定限價，使市民得以按價購買，並飭監視人員，切實執行。（五）中央市塲評定價格，大部低於市價，應分飭各項組合，遵照所評限價，出售貨物，實行全部組合化，則零售價格遂得抑平。（六）過去一般物品，往往經由同業公會呈請評價時，擅自漲價，或經査明該業大部同業，已超出限便，而該業公會並未呈報，故此後將是項責任，令各業公會，自行監視同業賣買，其有違法情事，處罰各該業公會負責人。上項辦法決於最近期內，切實實行，俾於此物價問題，日趨嚴重之時，得以抑平。</p>

<h3>金融工商市況　上週已趨平靜</h3>
<p>本市金融與工商各業市况，上週間已趨穩定，投機市儈殊少活動，人心異常鎭靜，物價起伏甚微。金融方面烚赤暗市始終站定七十八萬至七十九萬元左右局旋，紋銀九百元關。拆息六角，幷無更變。華股先漲後跌，頗鮮榮辱。工商方面，各工廠雖仍因電力未恢復，無法生產，但當局正在積極設法謀主要商品工廠供給電力辦法中，故各工廠準備供給電力辦法解決後，即行開車復工，是以人心安定，商業情况，不及過去之惶慮。且新市長就任在即，對於抑平物價安定民生，極爲嚴格執行，是以一般囤積居奇市商，不敢輕舉抬價，各項日用食品如米雜糧油糖柴炭市價，漲風戢平。</p>

<p>首都通訊</p>
<h3>首都雪地漫步</h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者　澹明</p>
<p>本月七日，南京下了一天一晚的雪，第二天起身一看，早已形成粉裝玉琢的世界。據說這次大雪，不僅爲國府還都後所僅見，就是在最近十多年中也是少見。所以街上積雪之深，或達二尺，天氣當然也驟然寒冷起來。由於雪光的返照，雖然滿天還是烏雲密佈，可是眼前倒感到雪亮起來。人行其中，實有羽化登仙之感。因此，記者這幾天不顧大雪紛飛，還是踏凍衝寒在街頭漫步。</p>
<p>參戰紀念</p>
<p>這天是我國的第二届參戰紀念。聽說爲了今沃國府要人都要去參加典禮的緣故，警局一早就動員警士把大道積雪掃除。記者一路從鼓樓向着保泰街走去，道旁軍警密佈，對着坐了汽車到國府去的要人們不住舉槍致敬。快要到鷄鳴寺時，迎面有一隊盟邦戰士跑步而來，個個英武非凡，於是我們就停立在道旁靜觀其雲地跑步的英姿。這正是大東亞決戰勝利的一種象徽吧。走進國民政府大禮堂，裏面已經有人，張限一看，原米先我而來的便是陳之碩次長。新任文官長周隆庠和監察院副院長徐蘇中等，也平已　座。其他還有不少高級官吏，大槪四五十位。出乎意料的，新任兼上海市長周佛海氏也從上海特地趕來出席這個紀念禮典。他今天是拿行政院副院長資格來出席的。周氏在還都之先，記者曾因趙厚生先生之伴同去見過他的，可是隔了四五年，體格愈見魁梧了。不多一會，陳代主席爲到，新任國府秘書林基與范光華等也一齊陪同而來。典禮隨着開始，自周副院長以下國府要人們，鴉雀無聲地靜聽陳氏宣讀其預光擬就的演說稿。中途，大門開啓，走進了外交部長褚民誼氏，他不發一言地默站在人叢中，陳氏宣讀演稿旣畢，大家便在音樂聲中退席。記者臨行，對着這一個多月前停過汪故主席靈柩的禮堂，發生無限的悵觸。</p>
<p>葉蓬談話</p>
<p>到珞珈路去拜訪葉陸軍部長，和他談了兩小時之久。葉氏因爲不滿渝方政學系才離開重慶，在香港響應和運。這幾年來，他一向掌握着國府兵政，但他自已總說沒有能够達到他預期的目的。國府的建軍，他認爲至少應做到：點·訓·編·調四個步驟，否則便要失敗。在大陸有成爲戰塲可能的今日，我們陸軍的實力十分重要，關於這個問題他的回答幽默而坦白，我想在現代的戰爭中，兵器的精銳應該特別重視吧。</p>
<p>參戰紀念的後一天，記者往傅佐路拜訪一位盟邦老友門屋博。門屋氏這幾年來在全國經濟委員會任顧問，他是丁默邨部長的至友，新近回到日本去娶妻，當我進去時，夫婦倆正在硏究中國語。七八年前記者和他初見，還不會講中國話，可是現在講得和中國人一般無二了。加以身上穿着中國服，乍看上去恐怕很難辨出他是日本人。據他的意思，中國的前途，非要從一種新思想中產出一個新制度，才能以新的人物來領導新的政治，再進而推行新的經濟政策。否則在政府增稅，官吏增俸與商人提髙物價的輪迴中，恐怕很難有良好的辦法吧！</p>
<p>訪傳式說</p>
<p>午後，記者到東箭道訪問建設部長傳式說氏。沿路已看到有許多地方雪被掃除過了。我國有句古話道：「各人自掃門前雪，莫管他人屋上霜」！這實在是今天最好的寫照。提到傳氏，他參加和運頗早，在談話中，我深感到他確是和平陣容中難得的剛毅之士。和他討諭到確保戰事後方的治安問題時，以他在浙主政的經騐，倒覺很有辦法。他說：「在我主政浙江的時候，地方保安隊即曾與渝共作戰數次，每次都曾獲得勝利。」</p>
<p>我問：「那末，難道武器製造也有辦法嗎？」</p>
<p>「只看有無領導的人」，他笑着說：「以我自己看來不是絕無辦法的。」</p>
<p>「中國今後的出路在那裏呢？」我再問。</p>
<p>「第一，」他說：「隨戰事的演變，今日成問題的，只是重慶如何擺脫英美的侵略而已。</p>
<p>「第二，今後的中國還應該從反共出發。」</p>

        <h1>1945 - n15</h1>
<h3>Utilizing the Natural Defenses of Luzon Island, Japanese Garrison Bravely Annihilates Enemy; One Enemy Vessel Sunk in Lingayen Gulf</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Philippine Frontline Base, 14th: The enemy forces that invaded Lingayen Gulf have been actively unloading tanks and vehicles on the 12th and 13th on the Lingayen front and in the San Fabian area. Although the landed enemy forces attempted to move south towards Kiangan, the battle situation on Luzon Island did not show any signs of becoming lively. The Japanese special attack unit took advantage of the enemy's hesitation and continued to launch attacks. On the 12th, the special attack unit moved into the Lingayen Gulf and bombed a large enemy vessel, either an aircraft carrier or a transport ship, sinking it.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 13th: Enemy forces on Luzon Island, with a strength of approximately two infantry divisions and one tank division, landed around San Fabian and Lingayen at the head of Lingayen Gulf and are currently desperately trying to secure a bridgehead. The enemy's landing aims to cut off the highway to Manila and control the Luzon Plain. The strategic importance of their landing point in Lingayen on Luzon Island for advancing into the Luzon Plain is immediately apparent. The northern part of Luzon Island is a rugged mountainous area, making it difficult to deploy large forces. The eastern coast of Luzon Island is a narrow plain, unsuitable for decisive battles. The southern part of Luzon is a plain area where large forces can be deployed, and large-scale mobile operations must focus on the central Luzon Plain. The western coast of Luzon Island experiences heavy rain from May to October, and it is currently the dry season, which the enemy is taking advantage of. This area has numerous rivers, including the Agno River, running through it, so even though it is called a plain, it is not a flat, expansive plain. The Luzon Plain campaign cannot ignore the rivers. The enemy army must use amphibious tanks as its primary force for attacking the Luzon Plain. When the Japanese army quelled Luzon, they defeated the American-Philippine forces composed of Philippine soldiers, which were a mixed force, so they were annihilated in one fell swoop, and the Luzon Plain was completely controlled and Manila entered within just one week. The operational capabilities of the Japanese army today are enough to frighten the enemy. This operation by the American enemy is the first large-scale land battle since the start of the Greater East Asia War, and their supply lines are extremely long. In the Luzon Plain campaign, recognizing the true strength of the Japanese army, based on General Yamashita's strong defensive posture, and paying attention to the mountains surrounding the plain, it will become clear that the American forces' operations will suffer heavy losses.</p>
<h3>Wan-ting, a Key Point in China and Burma, Captured by Japanese Troops; Enemy Transport Vehicles Bombed at Hsenwi</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Burmese Base, 14th: The Yunnan Expeditionary Force of the Chongqing government attempted to capture Wan-ting, a key point on the border between China and Burma. Since the end of last year, they have deployed the 5th Division of the 11th Army in the northeastern area and the entire 53rd Army in the northwestern area, launching attacks from both directions. However, the Japanese garrison forces in that area discovered that the main forces of the Chongqing's 53rd Army, the 130th Division and the 116th Division, attempted to cut off the Japanese army's rear starting from the 4th, crossing the Longchuan River. At that time, the Japanese army received reinforcements of new troops. Under the cover of tank units and field artillery units, they launched a preemptive and fierce counterattack from the Katianya River at dawn on the 6th, repelling the Chongqing army. A unit of the Japanese army even crossed the Longchuan River and is currently pursuing the fleeing Chongqing army in the north. The 11th Army of the Chongqing government, which launched an offensive from the northeast of Wan-ting, was also repelled by the Japanese army.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Japanese Military Base on the Burmese Front, 12th: Japanese elite fighter planes discovered a group of enemy vehicles west of Hsenwi in northern Burma on the 11th and immediately bombed them, setting three enemy trucks on fire and destroying four. Another team of Japanese planes continued to bomb the enemy airfield in that area, setting two enemy planes parked on the ground on fire. All Japanese planes returned safely to their base.</p>
<h3>British General Killed in Action in Luzon Landing Operation</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 14th: According to a London dispatch, the British War Office announced a few days ago that General Lumsden was killed in action on the 6th of this month while commanding operations on an American ship in the Pacific. Lumsden, 48 years old, was formerly Prime Minister Churchill's representative at the headquarters of Admiral Mountbatten.</p>
<h3>Japanese Forces in Southern China Closing in on Shao-guan</h3>
<p>Chongqing Guangdong Provincial Government Relocates</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 13th: The Japanese army's encirclement strategy on the mainland has gradually closed in on Shao-guan, an important city in the 7th War Area of the Chongqing government. According to local sources, Li Han-hun, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government of the Chongqing government, recently moved various provincial government agencies from Shao-guan to Longchuan on the upper reaches of the Dong River. Yu Han-mou, Commander-in-Chief of the 7th War Area, remains stationed in Shao-guan.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 13th: According to a Chongqing dispatch, General Wedemeyer, Commander of the U.S. Forces in the China Theater, declared on the 12th that although the Japanese army in China is being obstructed by the American forces entering Luzon Island, it is still possible that they will advance westward. If the Japanese army has sufficient time, they will even attack Kunming and Chongqing, as the Japanese army still possesses strong offensive capabilities.</p>
<h3>Battle Situation in Various Parts of Greater East Asia in One Week</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 14th: The main battle situations in various parts of Greater East Asia this week are as follows:</p>
<p>Philippine Front</p>
<p>From the 9th to the 13th, the enemy's Second and Third Fleets, following the First Fleet, forcibly landed in Lingayen Gulf, with a force of three to four divisions, including one tank division. However, currently, only the San Fabian area has tanks as the main force. In addition, the enemy is occupying a bridgehead in the narrow area from the coast to the Agno River to prepare their positions, and their large-scale offensive posture does not seem to be complete. In response, the Japanese land forces launched a fierce counterattack, and the two sides engaged in fierce fighting. At the same time, the Japanese special attack units and air force were also mobilized. On the 11th, more than twenty small landing boats in the 20-kilometer coastal area between San Fabian and Lingayen were fiercely attacked by the Japanese special attack units. Furthermore, the enemy landing forces are extremely panicked by the Japanese army's unique "night hand-to-hand combat assault" tactics and have deployed a strict security network outside their positions and added a large number of military dogs to the security, but the Japanese army still bravely broke through their security network and launched an assault, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. Also, the enemy's mobile units have been moving near the eastern sea since the 3rd and 4th, attempting to cut off the Japanese army's southern supply routes. On the 9th, 450 carrier-based aircraft and large aircraft flying from mainland China simultaneously attacked Taiwan.</p>
<p>Mariana Islands</p>
<p>According to foreign news reports, the enemy's air force headquarters has moved to Guam. The enemy army attaches great importance to the island because it was a base for Pacific operations before the war, so they will further strengthen the island in the future.</p>
<p>Morotai Island</p>
<p>The Japanese army is still continuing to carry out daring guerrilla warfare, disrupting the enemy's positions. At the same time, the Japanese air force is also coordinating with this, continuing to launch fierce attacks. From November 4th of last year to January 10th of this year, the Japanese air force achieved the following results in that area: burning more than 140 military facilities, affecting 44, destroying 153 aircraft, and damaging 128, for a total of 281 aircraft. In addition, many material warehouses were destroyed. The Japanese army on Tarikie Island is still fighting bravely, firing flares and continuing artillery fire near the airfield and the central highlands. The Japanese garrisons on Morotai and Tarikie Islands continue to fight bravely against the enemy forces in each area, preventing the enemy base from fully functioning. However, the enemy's land aircraft on Leyte and Mindoro Islands are repeatedly intensifying their advance. There are a total of 400 enemy aircraft on Leyte Island and approximately 100 enemy aircraft on San Jose.</p>
<p>Burma Front</p>
<p>(1) The 7th Division of the Yunnan Expeditionary Force of the Chongqing government attacked the rear of Burma from the east and north of the Salween River area. There are three more divisions waiting in reserve. Two divisions of the Chongqing's newly formed 1st Army, numbering 500, are at the Bhamo airfield near Namhkam, but continue to suffer losses. The Japanese army began to counterattack starting on January 6th and is currently engaged in fierce fighting. (2) On the eastern bank of the Irrawaddy River, two divisions of the mixed Chongqing-American forces advanced to approximately 40 kilometers north of Molo, Laban, and Mengshao Liao and are currently engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army. (3) On the Myitkyina railway line, the Japanese army is intercepting a total of seven divisions of the 4th Army and the 33rd Army of the Chongqing government, 60 kilometers northwest of Shwebo, 600 kilometers west of Monywa, and west of Kane. The Japanese army is currently engaged in fierce fighting with them. (4) Since the end of last year, the enemy forces have been gradually landing in the Akyab area from the Mayu Peninsula using mobile boats and ships. The Japanese air force and land forces launched a fierce attack on them, inflicting heavy damage. In particular, the Japanese army attacked an enemy convoy full of soldiers on the 9th, immediately setting two large enemy cruisers on fire and certainly sinking one of them, and sinking other boats of about 300 tons. In addition, the Japanese army attacked the Akyab area again on the 10th, setting seven places on fire and blowing up one place.</p>
<p>Shonan Front</p>
<p>Fifteen enemy B-29 aircraft attacked on the morning of the 11th.</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Attack Nagoya, Several Shot Down; Central and Southern Taiwan Also Attacked</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 14th: Sixty B-29 aircraft from enemy bases in the Mariana Islands invaded the central region from near the line from twelve o'clock on the fourteenth for one and a half hours, dropping incendiary bombs and bombs on the Nagoya area, and then fled south. The Japanese air defense forces were very active at the time, shooting down several enemy aircraft, which was witnessed by many. Detailed results are currently under investigation. Due to the fierce attack by the Japanese interception units, the enemy's bombing was not accurate, and the Japanese side suffered very little damage to important facilities.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 14th: The Japanese Taiwan Army announced at 2:50 p.m. on the 14th: At approximately 10:40 a.m. on the 14th of this month, approximately 50 large aircraft flying from China invaded the central and southern parts of the island, dropped some bombs, and then gradually retreated towards the western sea at approximately 1:00 p.m. Our side suffered minor damage.</p>
<h3>Heavy Losses for Chongqing Forces in Shandong Province</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Jinan, 13th: The Shandong Security Forces are constantly carrying out suppression operations to establish public order in the province. As of January 8th, there have been a total of 1,948 suppression operations of various sizes in the past year. The Chongqing forces suffered more than 12,000 casualties. The Security Forces recovered 19,673 Chongqing soldiers' bodies, captured 3,927 prisoners, seized 17 light machine guns, 2,776 rifles, 331 pistols, 1,983 hand grenades, 100 horses, and a large amount of other ammunition, clothing, and various mechanical materials.</p>
<h3>Ling Xiao Succeeds as Minister of the Navy</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th: Since Ren Yuan-dao, the Minister of the Navy, has been concurrently serving as the Governor of Jiangsu Province, naval affairs have been handled by Vice Admiral Ling Xiao as acting minister. Now, Minister Ren has requested the Central Political Committee to approve his resignation from the concurrent post.

The text of the government order is as follows: National Government Order, January 15th, Year 34. Ren Yuan-dao, concurrently Minister of the Navy, requests to resign from the concurrent post.

<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th: Li Yan-han, the main culprit in the Wuhan salt administration bribery case, was sentenced to death by the National Government Special Court and was executed by shooting at the Yuhuatai execution ground at 10:00 a.m. yesterday (the 14th). At 9:30 a.m. yesterday morning, the prisoner was brought to the court. Under the guard of the Special Service Battalion of the Garrison Headquarters and the Central Military Police, his identity was verified, the main text of the judgment was read, and he was photographed.

Also present were Battalion Commander Huang of the Special Service Battalion and more than 40 members of the military police. At 10:00 a.m., the execution was carried out. Li Yan-han was calm during the execution, knowing that he would die and had no complaints. After the execution, the body was photographed again. Because the prisoner had no family members in Nanjing, the National Government Special Court ordered the Nanjing Suburban Police Bureau to send police to guard the body, pending the arrival of his family members to claim the body. Thousands of people watched the execution. When Li was executed, everyone applauded and cheered.</p>

<h3>Sun Liangcheng Discusses Administration in Northern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th: General Commander of the Second Route Army and concurrently Director of Pacification for Northern Jiangsu, Sun Liangcheng, recently passed through the city. A reporter from the Central News Agency, in order to understand the current situation in Northern Jiangsu and the principles of Sun's administration, visited him and received the following remarks: Since I was appointed as the Director of Pacification for Northern Jiangsu, I have followed the intentions of the Central Government and strived to integrate military and political affairs into an inseparable force to promote all government affairs. In the past, the Northern Jiangsu area suffered greatly from the devastation of the communist bandits, and the majority of the people lived a miserable life in deep water and scorching fire every day. I personally witnessed the devastation during the troop transfer and felt tears welling up in my eyes. Therefore, I am determined to make the greatest effort to eliminate the communist bandits, revitalize government affairs, and relieve the people from their suffering.</p>
<h3>The Railway Protection Corps Returns to Nanjing After Inspection</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th: The Transportation Line Protection Committee, in order to understand the progress of railway protection work along the lines and the organization of the Protective Corps, has sent personnel to inspect the lines south of Bengbu on the Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou, Zhejiang-Jiangxi, and Jinpu Railways. The committee then continued to inspect the Protective Corps in each county along the Jinpu Line between Bengbu and Xuzhou and the Xin Huainan Line, expanding protection publicity. Each time they arrived in a location, they convened relevant agencies and held symposiums, lasting two weeks. There were approximately 500 or more officers and members of the Protective Corps. The corps and its entourage have now returned to Nanjing to report on their mission, and it is said that the members' performance was quite good.</p>
<h3>Fluid Warfare Evolves in the Ardennes Sector of the Western Front; German Forces Use Rocket Artillery</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 14th: The Havas News Agency reports: The situation in the Ardennes on the Western Front remains fluid. Both sides are unwilling to engage in prolonged trench warfare. Changes in positions are very slow and the sectors are small. On Friday, the German salient had moved south of Vielsalm and east of La Roche. The U.S. First Army's attack in the Salm area has made very little progress. The attacks by British and Canadian forces from the north and east are progressing at the same speed as the German retreat. The U.S. Third Army's offensive from Bastogne and Wiltz in the south has achieved a breakthrough, and the German army has launched a counterattack. The Allied counteroffensive in Alsace has gradually regained the initiative and is preventing the German army's attack south of Bischwiller.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 14th: According to frontline reports, the German army on the Western Front has begun to use long-range rocket artillery, constantly bombarding the U.S. Third Army's garrison. The rocket artillery is the same as that fired at the U.S. Third and Ninth Armies in mid-December.</p>
<h3>Turkey Opens the Dardanelles Strait</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 13th: According to Reuters, Washington: It is reported that the Turkish government has decided to open the Dardanelles Strait to the UK and the US for transporting military supplies to the anti-Axis forces.</p>
<h3>Germany Will Retaliate Against the Torgau Party</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 14th: The German News Agency reports that the German Foreign Ministry announced on the 13th that France is still persecuting so-called pro-German elements. Therefore, the German government, in accordance with the announcement in its note to the International Red Cross last December, will sentence five Torgau Party members in German hands to death after a formal trial.</p>
<h3>Eastern Front Soviet Army Launches Winter Offensive</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Soviet winter offensive was launched by the 1st Ukrainian Front on January 12th in southern Poland. The German military authorities are taking this Soviet offensive very seriously, even saying that January 12th, the day the battle began, will be a day remembered in history. According to German military authorities, the forces under Konev participating in the offensive consist of 24 to 28 divisions from three army corps of infantry, along with tank units.</p>
<p>Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) – German news agency reports: The major Soviet offensive anticipated by the German army has now reached its climax. The major offensive from the Vistula River bridgehead, which the Soviets began on January 12th, expanded again towards East Prussia on the morning of the 13th. Large-scale battles of decisive significance are now underway along a front of over 100 kilometers. It is believed that everything of the Soviet army will be decided by this offensive operation. The objective of the Soviet forces at the Baranow bridgehead is undoubtedly Silesia, while in the East Prussian sector, the operation seems to be aimed at Königsberg, and the area may be further expanded. The Soviet forces encountered German resistance at Baranow. Gaps have already opened up among the Soviet assault units in East Prussia.</p>
<p>German Troops Recalled from the Balkans to Participate in the War</p>
<p>Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) – German news agency reports: A German military spokesman stated on Saturday in response to questions that some of the German troops recalled from the Balkans have joined the line between Lake Balaton and the Drava River. The German troops, on their way, were attacked by Tito's forces, but were not hindered as a result.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen in a Love Triangle</h3>
<p>Since the Sino-Japanese War evolved into the Greater East Asia War, the love affair between the US, Chongqing, and the Chinese Communists has become overt, from being ambiguous. Enemy America's counteroffensive in the Pacific attempts to approach the Japanese mainland. However, being further away from their own country and facing the danger of destruction, the only way to save themselves, and in order to realize their ambition of dominating East Asia by fighting a decisive battle with Japan on the Chinese mainland, is to take advantage of the lovers they already had and those still in pursuit of—Chongqing and the Chinese Communists. If they can make both lovers willingly fall into their arms and indulge in wanton play, then the best way is to kill two birds with one stone. Two lovers in love with one man, each harboring a purpose, will naturally be jealous of each other, vying for beauty and favor, displaying every seductive charm, and offering their all to win the man's favor and raise their own value. However, in order to show their own nobility, even when seeking favors from a patron, they cannot speak directly, so there must be a madam trusted by both sides to mediate. At the same time, the patron, in order to flaunt in front of the lovers or monitor them for other affairs, also needs a madam to help. Song Ziwen's rise to power as the President of the Executive Yuan is exactly this kind of role.</p>
<p>This analogy may be a bit too vulgar, but it may be clearer than Mr. Yoshida To’s explanation of "Song Ziwen's entry into the cabinet and Chongqing's distress," and more suitable for Chinese people's understanding, right? Mr. Yoshida's insights are very accurate, and we fully agree with his opinion. However, from our Chinese perspective, we will add a few words to this issue, without intending to add a dog's tail.</p>
<p>The center of this love triangle is, of course, Chongqing. Therefore, Chongqing is the axis between the US, Chongqing, and the Chinese Communists. Song Ziwen's rise to power first reflects Chongqing's attitude, and Chongqing's attitude is linked to the relationship between the US and Chongqing, and the Chinese Communists and the US.</p>
<p>Before explaining these three relationships, we must first describe Song Ziwen and Chiang Kai-shek's foreign policy. As Mr. Yoshida said, Song Ziwen is the most suitable person to be the President of the Executive Yuan for the Chiang family. He had long wanted to ascend to this real position, but was always suspected by that brother-in-law. The reason for his lack of success was that he had the ability and qualifications, and had gathered around him a group of outstanding talents of the time. Therefore, Chiang knew that Kong Xiangxi was greedy, mediocre, and incompetent, but not dangerous and easy to control, more so than Song. Originally, Chiang Kai-shek's foreign policy had always been sitting in the car pulled by two horses, the "pro-Japanese faction" and the "European and American faction." In some situations, he put the former in front, and in others, he put the latter in front (to borrow Mr. Yoshida's words). However, Chiang never dared to properly harness this "European and American faction" horse—Song Ziwen—and let him pull his carriage. Now, the Americans dislike these obstinate horses and insist on replacing them with the beautified Song Ziwen. Chiang Kai-shek, in order to rely on the United States and gain its trust, naturally complied and let him drag the carriage into a dangerous situation.</p>
<p>At the same time, in order for Chongqing to be more in line with the US's wishes, the US must place in Chongqing's political center someone who can obey the US and ease the opposition between the government and the people, so that China's manpower and resources can be fully exploited and consumed. On the other hand, it must cultivate a puppet who can represent American interests during the war, in an attempt to turn China into an American war trophy—a colony—after the war. Song Ziwen is the most suitable role. The nurturing over the past few years has been for this purpose.</p>
<p>Secondly, there is the relationship between Chongqing and the Chinese Communists. As Mr. Yoshida said, Song Ziwen is someone who has had a considerable understanding of the Chinese Communists since the Anti-Japanese War, which is a fact. However, whether he is "the most trusted politician by the Chinese Communists" remains to be proven by facts. If he is as loyal to Chiang and the US as Kong Xiangxi, and neglects the demands of the Chinese Communists, or hinders the development of the Chinese Communists, I don't think the Chinese Communists will be more generous to Song than to Kong, right? Moreover, all the goals of the Chinese Communists are in "coalition government" and "joint command." If Song Ziwen participates in this group as one of the parties and factions, and takes the same political steps as the Chinese Communists, then the Chinese Communists will not oppose it and will treat him as a comrade in the united front. Therefore, Song Ziwen's appointment as president can only be seen as a shield for Kong Xiangxi for now, and cannot be regarded as a peacemaker between Chongqing and the Chinese Communists.</p>
<p>Thirdly, there is the relationship between the US and the Chinese Communists. Mr. Yoshida said in his article "The Reorganization of the Kuomintang and the Cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communists": "...The Chongqing army is more concerned about how to eliminate the Chinese Communist army in the future than how to prevent the Japanese army. And the Chinese Communist army is certainly concerned about how to disrupt the Japanese army, but it is even more concerned about expanding its sphere of influence as much as possible within the areas occupied by the Japanese army." This paragraph is enough to explain the key to the collusion between the US and the Chinese Communists. The US does not trust Chongqing and Chiang and wants the Chinese Communists to restrain Chongqing and Chiang from resisting Japan. If the US wants to win the war, it must find a second force in China, and this force can cooperate with the delusion of landing on the Chinese coast. Then, the Chinese Communist army is the most ideal. Therefore, the US cannot but recognize the political power of the Chinese Communist Party and collude with it.</p>
<p>The Chinese Communist Party is committed to using the contradiction and unity in dialectics. They use the contradiction between the US and Chongqing to unify the contradiction between the Chinese Communists and Chongqing and develop their sphere of influence. Then, they unify the contradictions between the US, Chongqing, and the Chinese Communists in "Resisting Japan." Song Ziwen stood up at this point.</p>

The chiefs of various bureaus and sections of the city government and senior officials will attend the handover ceremony. At 11:00 AM, the new and old police chiefs of the Municipal Police Bureau will hand over, and Director Zhou will officially take office.</p>
<p>Mayor Zhou Issues a Proclamation to the Citizens</p>
<p>The newly appointed Mayor of the Shanghai Special Municipality and Commander of the Security Force Zhou Fohai took office today (the 15th) and issued a "Proclamation to the Citizens of Shanghai" as follows:</p>
<p>"Citizens of Shanghai, at a time when the situation is serious and tense, I have been ordered to preside over Shanghai's municipal affairs. I deeply feel the great responsibility, the arduous task, and the difficult environment. Therefore, at the beginning of my term, I would like to briefly state some of my feelings and beliefs to my fellow citizens, fathers, elders, brothers.</p>
<p>A Heavy Burden Has Been Picked Up</p>
<p>On the day that Chairman Wang's coffin returned to Beijing, the Supreme National Defense Council held a meeting and elected Mr. Chen as the acting chairman. On the same day, Mr. Chen said to me: "I cannot take care of Shanghai's affairs. I have to ask you to take on the responsibility." At that time, because my own talent and energy were not enough to cope with Shanghai's complex and difficult situation, I declined politely. My best friends and the friends of friendly nations all advised me not to do it. They were all based on the enthusiasm to protect me and did not want me to come to Shanghai to sacrifice myself. They believed that Shanghai's situation would only become more difficult and worse in the future. No one would be able to do anything. Why should I bear the brunt and take on the difficulties and make sacrifices in vain? I am very grateful for their kindness. However, the reason why I did not dare to take on the responsibility was not because I was afraid of sacrifice. In such an extraordinary period, how can I still plan for myself? I did not dare to take on the responsibility entirely because there was no way to do it. Therefore, the issue of Shanghai's mayor was delayed for more than 40 days before it could be decided. Later, after Mr. Chen's order and the urging of comrades, I had to pick up this heavy burden.</p>
<p>Responsible for Guaranteeing Two Points</p>
<p>Now that I have picked up this heavy burden, how can I complete the task I have been given? Although I have been thinking hard day and night, consulting widely, I have not been able to get a satisfactory answer. I heard that many people have great expectations for my coming, which makes me even more worried and anxious. I hope that everyone will not have any expectations of me. Without expectations, you will not be disappointed in the future. The greater the expectations, the greater the disappointment in the future. I do not want everyone to be disappointed in the future, so I ask everyone not to expect it now. This is not me shirking responsibility, nor is it me belittling myself, nor is it me reserving excuses for when I do not do well in the future. In such a situation and environment, even a god with three heads and six arms would not be able to open up the deadlock and improve the current situation. With my weak ability, what can I do to fulfill everyone's expectations? However, I can guarantee two points to the citizens: First, I and my cadres have come with great determination this time. Our determination is to "want to do well," not only "want" but also "do" in the spirit of hard work, practical work, and tough work. As for whether it can be "good," although there is no full confidence due to the timing, environment, and other objective conditions, we will definitely do our best to use the timing, environment, and other conditions to do everything we can. We will not perfunctorily, not follow the old ways, not be complacent, not avoid labor and complaints, not use bureaucratic language. We will bury our heads in hard work in a down-to-earth manner, hoping to do as much good for the citizens as possible. This is the first point that I can guarantee to you.</p>
<p>Second, I and my cadres are all young and promising. We all have ideals, we all have a sense of enterprise, and our spirit is that public interest is more important than private interest, and society is before the individual. We will absolutely not use our power and position to seek personal gain. We know that it is not easy to establish a clean and honest atmosphere when life is pressing, people's desires are rampant, and the whole society is corrupt and degenerate. However, based on the spirit of Acting Chairman Chen's establishing a clean government, we are determined to lead by example, not to embezzle, not to pervert the law, not to engage in corruption for personal gain, and not to seize by force. Although we cannot achieve a clean sweep of corruption in one fell swoop, we must thoroughly investigate and rectify in a down-to-earth manner, hoping to do as much as possible to reduce the suffering of the citizens. This is the second point that I can guarantee to you.</p>
<p>Evildoers Will Never Be Tolerated</p>
<p>In addition, the ancients said: "To govern a chaotic world, use heavy penalties." Without eliminating violence, it is not enough to secure the good. To be lenient to corrupt officials who exploit the people, unscrupulous merchants who manipulate the market, and bandits who disrupt the neighborhoods is to be cruel to the good people. To be tolerant to evildoers who do evil is to be tyrannical to law-abiding people. If we find solid evidence of their wrongdoing, we will definitely punish them severely without tolerance, because I do not want to be cruel to the good people, so I will never tolerate or be lenient to evildoers. I hope that fair-minded people in society will assist me in investigating and reporting with a fair attitude. As for other things that need to be done, simply put, it is to follow the rules. Shanghai has been planned and managed by former Mayor Chen for more than four years, and the cause has a foundation and the administration has been on the right track. What I have to do in the future is what former Mayor Chen has already done but not yet completed, as well as what he wants to do and is about to start. I have no new policies, no new plans. My policies and plans are to continue the ideals and cause of former Mayor Chen in a consistent manner, and gradually realize them and gradually complete them.</p>
<p>Clean Up Undue Benefits</p>
<p>Because we want to do things, we cannot take into account feelings. Because we do not care about private interests, we must clean up or make public the undue benefits that have enriched individual pockets in the past. Therefore, I believe that those who do not have respect for personal feelings and who do not continue to have personal interests will definitely have repercussions. In the future, it will be inevitable to create rumors and even fabricate facts and distribute leaflets. In order to seek the welfare of the majority of people and to remove the suffering of the majority of people, we not only do not care about these actions of a few people who confuse right and wrong for personal interests, but also severely punish those who take the initiative to do so. However, when encountering these situations, I hope that you will investigate the facts and make a fair judgment, and do not easily believe the tricks of villains.</p>
<p>The ancients said: "There is no lofty theory in humility," and also said: "The key to governing is not in many words, but in how effective the actions are." At the beginning of my term, I am unwilling to make excessive promises or issue checks that cannot be cashed in the future, nor am I willing to make many arguments and make unnecessary propaganda. I will do as much as I can, and I will explain it to you in the future with actions and facts.</p>
<p>Finally, in order for government orders to be smoothly implemented, citizens must be able to understand and obey them. If there is no close link between the government and the people, government orders are not easy to implement. In the future, we will try our best to consult and adopt opinions from all parties. At the same time, I sincerely hope that the citizens will give full support and cooperation to the implementation of government orders. Zhou Fohai, Mayor of Shanghai Special Municipality and Commander of the Shanghai Security Force."</p>
<h3>Price Review Council Decides to Unify Price Management; Six Implementation Measures Agreed Upon</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Price Review Council, in view of the fact that although the council has recently reviewed and issued price limits, ordering merchants to sell accordingly, there are still some merchants who arbitrarily raise prices. In order to completely eliminate this malpractice, the council has passed a resolution to implement unified management of generally fixed prices. The content of the measures is as follows: (1) The supply of raw materials for items such as pancakes, fried dough sticks, noodles, glutinous rice balls, boiled water, and cotton has been suspended, resulting in reliance on the black market, and prices have skyrocketed, making it impossible to enforce the official price limits. Therefore, it is necessary to allocate the required raw materials on a regular basis. (2) Most of the white paper, chemical industrial raw materials, and Western medicine raw materials come from overseas. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the source of supply was cut off. The items currently traded on the market are all previous stocks, which have been hoarded by speculators, causing prices to soar. Therefore, it is planned to order the relevant industry associations to report and register all such materials in accordance with central regulations, and to implement unified management of the trading market. Except for legitimate supplies to manufacturers as raw materials, all other buying and selling are prohibited. (3) In the past, price limit investigations were conducted on the sales prices of various commercial establishments, and those who were punished were all retailers. However, in reality, wholesalers increased prices first, causing retailers to follow suit. Retailers who were investigated and punished by the authorities were not spared, but wholesalers who actually raised prices were able to escape punishment, which is the main reason why prices have not been suppressed. Therefore, in the future, in order to suppress prices, investigating and enforcing price limits must start with wholesalers to achieve the effect of getting to the root of the problem. (4) Most vegetable vendors are scattered along roads and streets, and few set up vegetable markets, making it impossible to unify the management of vegetable price limits. Therefore, it is necessary to submit a request to the municipal government to order the health and police authorities to concentrate all vendors in the city in vegetable markets for trading, and to strictly order vegetable vendors to mark the official price limits of all items sold in the vegetable market, so that citizens can buy at the fixed price, and to order supervisors to earnestly implement this. (5) The prices fixed by the central market are mostly lower than the market prices. Each association should be ordered to sell goods in accordance with the assessed price limits and to implement full collectivization so that retail prices can be suppressed. (6) In the past, general items were often raised in price by industry associations when they applied for price evaluation, or it was found that most of the industry had exceeded the price limit, but the industry association did not report it. Therefore, in the future, the responsibility for supervising the buying and selling of the industry will be given to each industry association, and the responsible persons of each industry association will be punished for illegal activities. The above measures will be implemented in the near future to suppress prices at a time when the price problem is becoming increasingly serious.</p>
<h3>Rice Mills and Rice Warehouses Must Register by a Deadline</h3>
<p>The Rice Grain Control Committee, in accordance with the provisions of the 1944 Rice Grain Procurement Implementation Outline for the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, is implementing control and management of rice mills and rice grain warehouses in various regions, and is handling registration procedures. The committee has already notified rice mills (including those using electricity and fire) and rice grain warehouses within the Shanghai Special Municipality and its seven subordinate counties to obtain and fill out registration forms from the Storage Section of the committee by the 22nd of this month.</p>
<h3>Financial, Industrial, and Commercial Market Conditions Were Calm Last Week</h3>
<p>The financial and industrial and commercial market conditions in the city were stable last week. There was little activity by speculators, and people were unusually calm. Price fluctuations were minimal. In the financial sector, the black market for fine gold has remained stable at around 780,000 to 790,000 yuan, and silver has stayed at 900 yuan. Interest rates for short-term loans remain at six corners, with no changes. Chinese stocks rose first and then fell, with little distinction between prosperity and disgrace. In the industrial and commercial sectors, although factories are still unable to produce due to the lack of electricity, the authorities are actively working on ways to supply electricity to major commodity factories. Therefore, factories are preparing to resume operations after the electricity supply solution is resolved, so people are at ease, and the commercial situation is not as panicky as in the past. Moreover, the new mayor is about to take office, and he will strictly enforce the suppression of prices and the stability of people's livelihoods. Therefore, general hoarders and speculators dare not easily raise prices, and the prices of daily necessities such as rice, miscellaneous grains, oil, sugar, firewood, and charcoal have been suppressed.</p>
<h3>Chinese Painting Society Holds a Public Memorial for Madam Xuyuan</h3>
<p>The Chinese Painting Society, including Shang Shengbo, He Tianjian, Zheng Wuchang, Wu Hufan, Zai Yachen, Sun Xueni, Wang Shizi, Qian Soutie, and others, will hold a public memorial for Madam Xuyuan, the mother of Mr. Chen Dingshan, on January 16th at the Chinese Painting Academy.</p>
<h3>Zhabei Baojia Association Officially Established</h3>
<p>Since the baojia (household registration) administration in the Zhabei District of this city was merged into the jurisdiction of the Police Bureau's Baojia Department, the Zhabei District Office of the Baojia Department was established a month ago, with the intention of reorganizing, dividing Lianbao (joint security) and Baojia districts, and establishing the Zhabei District Branch of the Municipal Baojia Committee, and appointing Lianbao chiefs. The organization has been strengthened, which is a prelude to the cooperation between the police and the baojia in Zhabei and the revitalization of the local area.

<h3>A Stroll Through the Snowy Capital</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for this Newspaper, Dan Ming</p>
<p>On the 7th of this month, Nanjing experienced a day and night of snowfall. Upon waking the next day, one found a world already transformed into a landscape of powdered white and jade. It is said that this heavy snowfall is not only the most significant since the Nationalist Government returned to the capital, but also a rare occurrence in the past decade or more. Consequently, the snow on the streets reached depths of up to two feet, and the weather turned sharply colder. Due to the reflection of the snow, despite the overcast sky, one felt a sense of brightness. Walking through it, one truly felt as though one was ascending to immortality. Therefore, despite the heavy snowfall, this reporter braved the freezing cold to stroll through the streets these past few days.</p>
<p>Commemoration of the War Participation</p>
<p>This day marked the second anniversary of our nation's participation in the war. It was said that because important figures from the national government were to attend the ceremony, the police had mobilized officers early in the morning to clear the snow from the main roads. The reporter walked from Gulou towards Baotai Street, along the way, soldiers and police were densely stationed, continuously raising their rifles in salute to the dignitaries who were traveling by car to the national government. Approaching Jiming Temple, a team of Allied soldiers ran towards us, each one exceptionally heroic, so we stood by the side of the road to observe their running姿态. This is truly a symbol of the victory of the Greater East Asia War, isn't it? Entering the National Government Auditorium, there were already people inside. Looking closer, it turned out that Chen Zhishuo, the Vice Minister, had arrived before me. The newly appointed Chief Secretary Zhou Longxiang, the Vice President of the Control Yuan Xu Suzhou, and others were also seated. There were many other high-ranking officials, roughly forty to fifty people. Unexpectedly, the newly appointed Mayor of Shanghai, Zhou Fohai, had also made a special trip from Shanghai to attend the commemoration. He attended today in his capacity as the Vice President of the Executive Yuan. Before the return to the capital, this reporter had met Zhou accompanied by Mr. Zhao Housheng, but after four or five years, he had become even more robust. Shortly after, Acting Chairman Chen arrived, accompanied by the new National Government Secretary Lin Ji and Fan Guanghua. The ceremony began, and from Vice President Zhou downwards, the national government officials listened silently to Chen's speech, which had been prepared beforehand. Midway through, the doors opened, and Foreign Minister Chu Minyi walked in. He stood silently in the crowd without saying a word. After Chen finished reading the speech, everyone left to the sound of music. As the reporter departed, I felt a surge of melancholy as I faced the auditorium where the late Chairman Wang's coffin had rested just over a month ago.</p>
<p>A Conversation with Ye Peng</p>
<p>I went to Luojia Road to visit Army Minister Ye and spoke with him for two hours. Ye left Chongqing due to his dissatisfaction with the political faction of the Chongqing government and responded to the peace movement in Hong Kong. In recent years, he has always been in control of the national government's military affairs, but he always said that he has not been able to achieve his desired goals. He believed that the national government's military build-up should at least achieve the four steps of: point (selection), train (training), compile (organization), and transfer (deployment), otherwise it would fail. With the possibility of the mainland becoming a battlefield today, the strength of our army is very important. Regarding this issue, his answer was humorous and frank. I think that in modern warfare, the sophistication of weaponry should be particularly valued.</p>
<p>The day after the War Participation Commemoration, the reporter went to Fu Zuo Road to visit an old Allied friend, Mr. Monwu. Mr. Monwu has been serving as a consultant for the National Economic Commission for the past few years. He is a close friend of Minister Ding Mocun. He recently returned to Japan to get married. When I entered, the couple was studying Chinese. When the reporter first met him seven or eight years ago, he could not speak Chinese, but now he speaks it as well as a Chinese person. In addition, he was wearing Chinese clothes, so it would be difficult to distinguish him as Japanese at first glance. According to his opinion, China's future requires a new system to be produced from a new ideology, so that new people can lead new politics, and then promote new economic policies. Otherwise, in the cycle of the government increasing taxes, officials increasing salaries, and merchants increasing prices, it is feared that there will be no good solution!</p>
<p>Visiting Chuan Shishuo</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the reporter visited Construction Minister Chuan Shishuo at Dongjian Road. Along the way, I saw that the snow had been cleared from many places. There is an old Chinese saying: "Each person sweeps the snow in front of their own door, and does not care about the frost on other people's roofs!" This is truly the best depiction of today. Speaking of Chuan, he participated in the peace movement quite early. In the conversation, I deeply felt that he was indeed a rare resolute person in the peace camp. When discussing the issue of ensuring security in the rear of the war, his experience as the head of Zhejiang was very effective. He said: "When I was in charge of Zhejiang, the local security team fought with the Chongqing Communists several times, and each time they won."</p>
<p>I asked, "Then, is there a way to manufacture weapons?"</p>
<p>"It only depends on whether there is a leader," he said with a smile, "In my own view, it is not impossible."</p>
<p>"Where is China's way out in the future?" I asked again.</p>
<p>"First," he said, "According to the evolution of the war, the problem today is how Chongqing can get rid of the Anglo-American aggression.</p>
<p>"Second, China in the future should start from anti-communism."</p>
