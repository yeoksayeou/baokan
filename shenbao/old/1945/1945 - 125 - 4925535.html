<h3>琉球本島西海岸正殿開激烈戰鬥日特攻隊毀沉敵艦四艘</h3>
<p>南西基地四日中央社電　琉球本島二日之戰情如次：相當有力之敵軍進攻東海岸，至是日上午十一時，卒被勇敢之日軍擊退，在幸地前田方面，敵軍用戰車來攻，亦遭日軍反復猛擊。至於西海　方面之敵軍，亦賡續進行砲攻，時過正午，其砲火益見熾烈，但日軍確保陣地，牢不可破，至三日敵軍反復來攻幸地，每被日軍擊退，其在前出及中間，仍有有力敵軍佐以戰車反復來攻，但日軍確保陣地，使敵損失慘重。是日西海岸亦有一部份敵軍進攻，至下午二時左右，更調動一隊來援，日軍奮勇迎敵，加以猛攻，現正展開激戰。</p>
<p>南西基地四日中央社電　日特攻隊及航空隊，不分晝夜，賡續攻擊琉球周圍之敵方艦船，由陸上基地可望見友軍飛機勇敢攻擊之情况，使地上部隊將士意氣益加軒昂。三日黃昏時候，日單攻破敵方巡洋艦一艘，並擊沉其驅逐艦及掃海艇各一艘，又在北飛機塲洋面，擊沉其巡洋艦一艘。此外，日空軍三日晚猛攻琉球本島北中兩飛機塲，十餘處發生大火，爲時甚久。又三日在琉球列島全綫來炸敵機，約有三百五十架，其中有B29型數架。</p>
<p>日軍官民獻金造機</p>
<p>東京四日中央社電琉球之決戰，實決定大東亞與亡之重大關鍵，因日陸海空三軍發揮特攻妙術，致使敵方美軍大受挫折，焦慮萬分，而在琉球之日方同胞，眼看「神　」玉碎精神，無不大呌「特攻機再接再厲，不可斷絕」。因其愛國情切，故近由琉球縣政府職員全體及縣內中等學校　國民學校全體職員，將四月份薪水全數獻給陸軍省，以為建造飛機之資金。又琉球全數部隊將兵，亦將其四月份薪金全數獻給陸軍省，以為鞏固國防之用。</p>
<p>美國作戰前途困難</p>
<p>廣州四日中央社電　三十日合衆社電叙述日特攻隊之規模及其威力如次：「日軍特攻隊時常編成大隊來襲，如二十八日下午賡續來攻，美方艦船雖拼命防擊，開砲猛射，亦無如之何」。又據三十日渝方廣播謂，軍事委員會發表，琉球日軍特別攻擊機隊，使美軍無法可施，且如此隊伍，殆有無盡藏之概，因此美國對日作戰前途非常困難，大陸之渝軍擬早日調動援軍應戰。</p>
<p>里斯本三日中央社電　據關島基地來電，英戰艦「喬治五世」及空母「伊拉托里亞斯」參加太平洋之戰一事，已由英·美海軍當局發表。美太平洋艦隊司令部三日又發表謂，更有英國最新銳快速空母「因度密達布爾」，「因第化地加布爾」及「維多利亞」（俱皆一萬三千噸者），最近協助美軍在琉球作戰，攻擊南西羣島。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>中國靑年往何處去？</h3>
<p>誰都不能否認，目前我們所處的時代，是人類歷史上空前重大的時代，經過這次大戰之後，凡是腐敗份子，以及那些醉生夢死不自振作的份子，都將被時代的洪流所淘汰；只有自强不息的，力圖振作向前邁進的，才有歷盡艱苦之後吐氣揚眉的日子。但是，回顧我國，回顧我國家命運所寄託的靑年的現狀，我們實在不能不爲之寒心！</p>
<p>根據最近的實際情形觀察，目前和平區內靑年，有三種傾向：第一種是完全不顧現實，不顧世界和國家民族的前途，祗知依仗父祖所有財勢，過着醉生夢死的「生活」，正如「覺世經」所謂「其身雖在，其心已死」。第二種是祗知消極地不滿現實，凡事都表示不滿，悲觀和失望，但是並無改善現狀的志趣與能力。永遠處身事外。第三種態度雖較積極，但受生活壓迫，不得不向求生之途亂鑽，於是跑單帮，擺攤頭，做投機，掙外快；推其謀生之心不無可以同情之處，而因此不能顧及國家社會，利之所在，不惜忘義而行之﹔大義所在，有背私利而逃避。常然除了這三种人之外，偶而也能看到奮鬥有爲的靑年，但是鳳毛麟角，究佔極少數而已。</p>
<p>其次，尤足痛心的，近來有許多大學生，不知硏習學問，準備將來爲建設新中國的幹部，竟有自甘墮落的行爲，例如羣趨集團舞會等等事實，本報屢次接到讀者來函，痛陳近來上海多數大學生的荒唐行爲，層出不窮。按本市大學生集團舞會，始於本年國暦新年，由各大學同學，假座麗都舞廳舉行聯歡舞會，會中仿獎劵辦法，由幾個女同學推銷幸福劵，對號開奬，但結果收入鉅大，除預定獎金外頗有盈餘。從此多數大學生乃爲之曠課棄學，而競趨於所謂集團跳舞的「派對」。同時正在衰落中的本市舞業，亦以此爲一新利蔽，紛紛迎合颓廢靑年的心理，假名「大學生舞會」而作穢凟行爲的歛錢勾當。諾如此類的誘惑靑年行動，因此，意志薄弱的靑年極易墮落，實在是社會國家一大危象！</p>
<p>在此時局動盪之際，爲着社會國家前途打算，我們認爲對於靑年的關懷和指導，實爲當前最重大的任務之一。盟邦日本的靑年，非已從軍，在前綫爲保衛祖國而作戰，即在後方參加增產工作﹔他們無分男女，一致在嚴肅地工作。內地的靑年男女，大都也在嚴肅地學習和工作。如果和平區的靑年長此醉生夢死，不知振作，對於國家前途，眞是不敢設想！至於一般靑年之不滿現狀，就另一觀點說，無寗是可喜的現象，但是一味不滿現狀是不够的，同時更思如何積極協助改善現狀，才不愧爲有志靑年，那麼，在學者必須硏究學問，鍛鍊體魄，在工作者必須努力本位工作。消極的悲觀失望的情緒，都不是健全的靑年所應有的態度！</p>
<p>然而，靑年界消沉墮落現象的形成，社會領導者未能以身作則及時糾正，實咎無可辭。社會領導者的言行舉動，對於靑年自能發生影響作用，所以，必須做成靑年們的模範；對於國家民族利社會公益事業，尤應挺身而出，不畏縮，不廻避，不取巧營私，使社會風氣，逐漸轉移。盟邦鈴木首相，以古稀高年，在國家危急之秋，挺身而出，其靑年精神，實足爲國人共同效法。今天是靑年節，顧靑年諸君奮起振作，大家發揮靑年的朝氣，才能革新政治，改造國家，實現時代所賦與的使命！</p>
<h3>泰拉干日軍奮戰林卡斯海岸砲擊熾烈</h3>
<p>某基地四日中央社電　在泰拉干島登陸之敵軍，三日調動有力部隊，佐以戰車，來攻日軍守備綫，日軍守備隊乃將敵軍引至陣地前，突加痛擊，敵軍不支，敗走海岸地帶，死傷約四十名，而日軍砲兵隊亦起呼應，一齊開砲，立刻擊沉敵軍小型艦艇三艘。</p>
<p>西南太平洋基地四日中央社電泰拉千島之戰况，三日無大變化，敵軍以登陸用船隻，力圖增强戰車兵員，準備進攻，但未展開實戰。其接近林卡斯海岸之敵艦船，正以艦砲射擊，情景至爲熾烈，日軍由陸上開火射擊，當即擊沉其掃海艇三艘，並擊毀其他一艘，其餘巳不見形影，是可斷定為希圖由東海岸登陸者，日軍現正嚴密警戒敵軍動向。二日晚日軍挺身而進，殺入敵陣，攪亂其陣營，殺傷多數人員，摧毀敵人之攻勢。</p>
<p>泰拉干島登陸係圖奪取煤油</p>
<p>西南太平洋基地四日中央社電　敵軍旣在泰拉干島登陸，其欲奪取婆羅洲煤油資源之野心，益見明顯。在琉球決戰熾烈之時，敵方竟分遣大艦船及兵員資材强行登陸泰拉干，察其原因，約有數端，即　敵軍雖已突進日軍內錢防禦機，但馬里亞納基地之B29型轟炸日本土不見奏效，尤其在琉球島周圍，空母及其餘艦船之損失，可謂大東亞戰爭發生以來未曾或見之悲慘者。因此，艦船及飛機所用之燃料，不仰求於本國，而不得不求諸作戰地域鄰近煤區。　泰拉干島之煤油油質極良，可立刻利用。　不但可以妨害日方之煤油資源，而且對昭南（即新加坡）之作戰，亦可加增其速度，由是觀之，敵人之野心實不容忽視，然而日軍防衛陣萬無一失，已有十足之準備。</p>
<h3>英機動部隊砲攻大橫島</h3>
<p>印度洋某基地四日中央社電英機動部隊三日自上午十時起，約歷半小時之久，接近安達曼蔡島之大橫島，加以砲攻。</p>
<h3>美陸海軍傷亡統計</h3>
<p>里斯本四日中央社常據華盛頓電﹕美陸長史汀生昨於華盛頓發表在義境作戰之美軍死亡數，爲二萬一千五百七十七名。渠稱此項死亡數目，實爲美第五軍於作戰以來至四月廿八日止所付之至大代價，此外更有七萬七千二百四十八名受傷，一萬另二百八十八名失踪，統計死亡傷失之美軍總數局十萬另九千二百十三名。，在各戰區美陸軍之損失為八十四萬八千另八十八名，海軍之損失為十萬另二千三百八十三名，統計損失陸海軍總數為九十五萬另四百七十一名。</p>
<h3>日定例閣議通過戰災神社復興案</h3>
<p>疏散輸送緊急措置要綱央定</p>
<p>東京四日中央社電　日定例閣議，四日正午舉行，通過　疏散輸送緊急措獨要綱，　戰災神社應急設施案，至四時散會。</p>
<p>東京四日中央社電　日政府決定復興遭殃神社，為執行祭祀及一般國民祭拜所必要之設施，以顯示神社爲中心之皇國眞容，業於四日閣議附議「戰災神社應急設施案」，由阿部內相說明理由，當即決定，並由情報局發表。</p>
<h3>李外長接見各國使節</h3>
<p>南京四日中央社電　新任外交部長李聖五氏，於四日上午十時在該部首次會見各國駐華使節，到有日大使谷正之·德大使韋爾曼·滿大使李紹庚·義代辦施畢納利等等，作誠摯懇談，至十一時始先後辭去。</p>
<h3>王委長視察畢自津返平</h3>
<p>北平四日中央社電　華北政委會王委員長，於日昨赴津後，連日除分訪關係機關及視察各方外，並對津市府公務員訓話，檢閱津市警察隊，頃已公畢，於昨日上午十時半由津乘東返平。走，繼有三十餘架，於上午八時十分左右，分爲三隊，由紀伊水道室戶　，及足梢岬方面來襲，在松山及和歌山縣北方投彈後飛去，其中十一架於九時左右經由豐後水道侵入西部軍管區。</p>
<p>東京四日中央社電　四日上午六時餘，敵機B29型八架飛進神戶市投彈後，向南方飛去，上午八時半左右，有B29型約四十架來炸鹿兒島及犬分地區。</p>
<p>峇厘巴板三日中央社電三日十二時半，有敵機。B24型十八架來炸峇厘巴板，投彈於飛機塲周圍，然後飛去。</p>
<p>B29型敵機分襲日各地九州四國墜毀十餘架</p>
<p>福岡四日中央社電　敵B29型機十餘架，四日上午零時半左右來襲關門地區海面（用單機戰術散兵而來）由抵空投擲機雷，然後飛去。八時半左右，復有B29型五十餘架再襲九州，其中卅餘架侵入大分地區，轟炸大分及佐伯鄰近，然後飛去，其他二十架則侵入大村，擲彈後飛走。又三日敵機侵入時，日制空部隊在四國西南海面邀擊，當即擊落其兩架，並擊毀其六架。再四日之首次邀擊戰，日方擊落敵機兩架，擊毀一架，並用地上砲火擊毀其兩架。</p>
<p>大阪四日中央社電　三時下午十一時餘，有敵機B29型十五架，由紀伊半星飛入大阪，又有三架由紀伊水道進犯，在大阪灣盤旋後，即向南方飛去，諒必投擲機　，又神戶方面亦　彈若干枚，但日方殆無受害。而在同時刻，有敵機五架沿高知縣西南部向西北而飛，在豐後水道國防灘及山口縣西部盤旋後即飛未，似投擲機雷。更有一架於四日上午六時餘由高　西南方北進，經由廣島屋及香州縣西方，由德　縣東南方飛</p>
<h3>延安舉行全代會</h3>
<p>里斯本四日中央社電　中國共產黨四月下旬於延安舉行第七次全國代表大俞中，決定團結全中國人民，以挽救重慶國民黨政府諸錯誤政策所造成之危局，建設中共所謂自由與民主統一之新中國云。又此次大會出席者主席　毛澤東·朱德·周恩來等十五名，及正式代表五百四十四名，候補代表二百〇八名，合計七百數十名，爲中國共產黨全體黨員一百二十萬名之代表者。大會　事日程計分四項：即爲毛澤柬之政治報告，朱德之軍事報告，劉少奇之改正黨章報吿，及選舉中央委員。尤以毛澤東之政治報告極堪注目，全文約達六萬字，其要旨論述所謂「聯合政府」，極力否定重慶政權偽造之所謂國民大會，力主應聯合各黨各派成立聯合政府。於此，中國共產黨對重慶國民黨，再度展開積極的理論鬥爭更形表面化，此現象實堪注目也。延安政權首次開全國代表大會，乃在一九二一年一月，而此次之舉行，距離首次大會已有十七年之久。</p>
<h3>停戰交涉在進行中</h3>

<p>瑞典京城四日中央社電　據倫敦消息：昨英首相邱吉爾於質詢期問中，竟於下院缺席，遂引起議員種種猜測，或以爲渠係赴美，以與特魯曼總統會商，或以爲渠係飛往德國，以親自處理某項重要事件。</p>
<p>地方通訊</p>
<h3>合肥漫話</h3>
<p>— 徐銘</p>
<p>合肥地據安徽中部，位於長江。淮河之間，北指中原，南　首都，三國以來，江淮有事，是兵家必爭之地。且問屬皖省產米區域，故風調雨順之年，富庶冠於淮南。筆者來此巳有月餘，耳聞目覩，頗足爲上海人報告，緣特記之以　讀者。</p>
<p>地靈人傑</p>
<p>合肥是一座古城，也是一個「出人」的地方。三國演義上有「張遼威　逍遙津』一回，這個逍遙津，就在合肥城內，其地並有曹操點將臺，爲名勝古蹟之一。相傳歷史上有名的鐵面無私包大人，即是合肥人。城外之包公祠，包家河，尚可供後人憑弔。淸末民初的李鴻章，段祺瑞，都是一時叱咤風雲的人物，老家也在此地。至於蒙受淸代皇帝封賜之大官大顯，耳聞亦不少。據合肥人講，合肥人在軍隊中的師長階級，在二百名以上，團營長等則不可勝計，衛立煌亦爲合肥人。據堪與家謂合肥因北環叢山，南抱巢湖，且土質渾厚，頗得「地靈」，是故多出「人傑」。本地人都以詩書傳家，城中家家戶戶大門上的春聯，觀乎其書法之精湛，即可知合肥是一個書香之城了。</p>
<p>交通市况</p>
<p>自去歲淮南綫改道後，此地因在拆路區內，火車已不能直達。現存之交通綫有二：</p>
<p>（一）合肥至水家湖之「華中運轍」卡車。由水至蚌埠有火車卸接。即進南綫。</p>
<p>（二）自合肥經巢縣至裕溪口之小火輪。由裕渡江即至蕪湖。</p>
<p>二綫比較，以第一綫爲安全。車費則皆昂貴。合肥市面在未拆鐵　前，已少起色，待拆路後，更是一蹶不振。食物價雖便宜，然掙錢亦難。去　各地豐收，獨合肥苦旱，以致打擊尤甚。若今後交通依舊不便，則市况總無望好轉。物價米每担五萬六，大斗，麵粉四百一斤，豬肉五百五一斤。雞蛋百元三只。</p>
<p>土膏桌子</p>
<p>當地烟土公賣，因利潤豐厚，故農家鮮有不種者。年來雖官　文章三申五令，然言諄諄，聽者藐藐，少有成效。且與地方財政有關整頓頗難。烟土之主要交易塲所，在城外東門。方桌爲記，上置烟土，賣出買入，即在靈天行之，設備簡單，手續便捷。當地人稱爲「土膏桌子」，與蚌埠之「老鼠籠子」，可謂相互媲美。因產鴉片。故有嗜好者亦特別多，畏此下去，前途堪慮。</p>
<p>荒年即景</p>
<p>大凡以農為本的地方，百姓都是靠天吃飯，合肥因去年苦旱，在今年小麥尙未收穫前，過的確是荒年生活，城內住家，多數係工商。地主及軍人，故生活還可應付。鄉村農民則收成旣無，捐稅浩繁，爲了不願拋棄世代爲業的田地，生活困疲至極。一般農家，過了農忙時期，少壯多數出外逃荒，居家的因無錢購買米糧，皆以　麥糊·小蒜·山芋葉及野萊等果腹，筆者在鄉下從未見種田人吃米飯。但爲了應付催米，催草，鄉民又不得不借錢購米買草，以　荀延殘喘，其情之可憐，實有不勝筆述者也。至於鄉鎭中烟·賭·高利貸之普遍，則與江浙鄉閒，初無二致。</p>
<p>人民負担</p>
<p>今以地而十五方里，人口一萬餘之一鄉爲單位，其人民每月之負担有下列各項：　食米二百二十担。</p>
<p>燒草六百担。</p>
<p>現鈔五百五十萬。</p>
<p>用勞力二萬工。平均每戶一丁，每月工作十五天，不供膳食。</p>
<p>其他臨時之建築材料，如土磚，木料等，無定期随需要徵用。至於賦稅，尙未列入，總之機關林立，軍隊即有謂共和國三種，人民負担之重，可想而知。</p>
<p>舍肥有他榮　的過去，且是淮南重鎭，但由於頻年變亂及交通阻梗，已使其日漸衰颓。如何得予復興，合肥人與當道是各有責任的。（移酬助學）</p>
<h3>英美蘇三軍續在多處會師英軍迫近丹麥邊境</h3>
<p>瑞典京城四日中央社電　據最近到達此間消息稱：英軍已佔領德國第二大城市漢堡，而英美重與紅軍在德境更作多處之會師，故歐洲戰事已趨於尾聲。據反軸心自羅馬方面消息，維埃了　夫將軍所指揮北義及西奧之德義軍隊，已對反軸心軍投降，故血戰兩年半之義大利戰事，已於星期三結束。據亞歷山大最後公佈稱：北義伊遜蘇河西面戰事已告停止。又據自柏林方而消息：北部之德境走廊已被封閉，而南部德境僅餘三千二百平方公里之狹小三角地帶，尚不及德國全領土百分之一。昨晨英蘇兩軍在威斯瑪會師後，旋又在格拉布地區會師；同時美第九軍在維頓柏格附近三點地區，又與蘇軍獲得會師，蘇軍向西進展，驅使大量德人投入蒙高茂萊部隊之手中。在南部地區，美第七軍距離音斯布羅克僅十一公里，美第三軍進抵距薩爾斯堡四十公里之地點，又距離林茲做二十五公里。在慕尼黑及多瑙河間，於尼恩河上　據一百二十公里之綫，美第三軍在六處渡過尼恩河，向南推進，以圖肅淸殘餘德軍。同時瑞典無錢電昨夜宣稱：英軍已渡基爾運河，已抵達距丹麥境五十公里之埃克福爾特。（Eckemrforbe）</p>
<p>德新元首指揮抗戰</p>
<p>瑞典京城四日中央社電　據反軸心方面消息：杜尼資大將及其外長克羅西克伯爵，昨傳係在基爾（Kiel）附近，基爾係與在魯比克（Rubeek）之英軍僅五十五公里距離，乃德國之海軍根據地。</p>
<p>蘇黎世三日中央社電德軍元帥爾那，刻正指揮德國全軍抵抗紅軍。三日由德國南部廣播電台廣播，指令其麾下將兵全員，在杜尼資元首領導下一致團結，　續作戰。</p>
<p>戰後柏林景象凄涼</p>

<h3>强化公會組織　疏通貨物來源　許經濟局長談施政槪况</h3>
<p>上海特別市宣傳處主持之第十五次記者例會，於四日上午十時半，仍在市府會議室舉行，特請市經濟局局長許江出席解答各報社所提問題，茲分誌如下：</p>
<p>抑平物價</p>
<p>（問）邇來滬市物價漲無止境，影響民生治安甚鉅，貴局兩度抑平物價核定新限價，但各業商實際遵限價售貨者仍屬寥寥，貴局有否澈底抑制之具體辦法？（答）本局辦理商品登記取締國積，即爲抑止物價基本工作，關於超越限價商店，隨時派員密査，分別處罰，並函警察局協助辦理。至於澈底抑制之具體辦法，正在積極疏通貨物來源。</p>
<p>（問）邇來因公用事業增價，各項商品，亦相繼瘋狂上漲，其對策如何？（答）各項商品隨公用車業增價而上漲，本局芷在調查中。</p>
<p>整理公會</p>
<p>（問）强化各業同業公會組織機構，其應行改組或合併之公會，現推進情形如何？（答）整理同業公會工作，最近可以完成，惟强化組織機構頭緒紛繁，俟全案決定後，當可詳細公布。</p>
<p>商品登記</p>
<p>（問）主要商品登記於四月十六日開始辦理後，聞各業遵限辦理者，尚欠踴躍，如逾期未　辦登記者，擬如何處置？（答）辦理主要商品登記一切辦法手續，已於報端披露，本局巳嚴催各同業公會轉知各同業如期登記，以免逾期，致干處罰。</p>

<p>（問）貴局長對於股票及黃金之暴漲暴落，作何感想？（答）股票黃金暴漲，因游資作崇而動盪，但暴漲暴落均屬可處，政府正密切注視，使之漲落趨於合理化。</p>
<p>最近施政</p>
<p>（問）經濟局最近施政情形如何？對於目前很亂之經濟狀况有無改進之新計劃？（答）本局最近施政方面無新的計劃，現正一·强化公會，二·設法疏通貨物來源，以上兩項倘能順利進行，對於目前混亂之經濟狀况，不無裨益，否則雖有新計劃恐難實現。</p>
<p>食油價格</p>

<h3>含笑赴冲繩</h3>
<p>—特攻隊是「活炸彈」—陸海兩軍航空基地三特派員座談會</p>
<p>渡邊：我到過陸軍甲基地，這是九州南部的最前綫，因與沖繩本島的距離最近，所以出征的特攻隊飛機就好像到了戰塲一樣。且敵方小型飛機，或由硫黃島飛來的短距離飛機，往往出乎音外地飛來襲擊，實在情形緊張得很。緊張而興　的幕僚以及指揮所的人們，自從敵美在沖繩島登陸以來，從無安睡過一次，往往是伏在自己的辦公棹上打一盹。因此完全喪失了食慾，吃飯只是吃一兩筷子就不想再吃了。一聽說特攻機到了，就是正在吃飯的特攻隊員，也立刻放下筷子就想去打仗。無論是特政隊員，也無論是警備兵，整個基地的人們完全打成一片，準備以身體向敵方航空母艦撞拼。這樣一個基地完全成爲大砲了，每天每天都不斷地向冲繼島放射特攻隊「活炸彈」：</p>
<p>岡府寺：老實說，基地的戰鬥精神眞可以驚天地泣鬼神。不在基地的人，絕對想像不到基地的那種精神。凡是看見過基地這種威力的，都會油然而生一種强烈的增加生產飛機之意念。只要有飛機就會勝利的，這是所有人的信念。</p>
<p>三村：一言以蔽之，冲繩作戰是太平洋決戰的主要戰塲轉移到此處了。並且按時機上說，也已進入千鈞一髮的緊要關頭了。「一失足成千古恨」這一句名言，恰是形容此地的適當話。每一個人都這樣張烈地感覺到。所以說，基地方面的緊張情形眞了不得。與其說一般人都渴望飛機來援，莫如說每一個人都充滿了同仇敵愾心。物質源源不斷地向冲繩運輸。我們那個基地自從四月六日第一次出擊以來，差不多每天都不斷出擊了。有一個白天，向我們基地前進的特攻隊，爲了出擊殺敵，竟沒有喝茶的時間。同時因爲氣象條件的關係，一夜都在基地上跑來跑去。看着這種情形，沒有一個人不被感動的。從這裏可以看出冲繩島作戰的情形。</p>
<p>忠勇精神</p>
<p>岡府寺：第一，第二，第三這樣特攻隊的攻擊，次數愈多則愈難，現在是最難的時候。因爲敵人在最初由於日本特攻隊飛機的撞拚，兌手足失措，呆然若失。自然，這是因爲第一次碰到日本陸海兩軍的航空部隊採用這種特別攻擊法。設法不使特攻機撞上的敵方防衛砲火，近來愈益熾烈了。敵方裝着感性最强的電波探知器之護衛戰鬥機，現在愈來愈多了。他們怕夜間空襲，而不惜大量地放出夜飛戰鬥機來。全靠物資豐富的敵人，眞是名不虛傳，現在夜飛戰鬥機也全都是性能優秀的。一提到特攻隊，或許還有人誤會只要帶着炸彈或魚雷對着敵方艦船撞下去就可以，但事實並不如此簡單。必須瞭解，特攻隊的任務愈重，則困難愈大。</p>
<p>還有我們日本空軍當中，有人認爲敵美來侵沖繩本島的艦船，共達一千四百餘艘，但按日本大本營所發表的戰果說，只消滅了一半，於是有點感覺灰心和氣餒。但實際戰果，是比發表的數字多得很。</p>
<p>大本營發表的戰果，只是護送戰友所承認的最大戰果。前幾天沒有直接掩護機的保護，特攻機所得到的戰果，就無法查考，因爲所有飛機都撞到目的物上而沒有回來，這也就無從知道了。一定有人認爲直接掩護機隨着出繫，目的是在判斷戰果，以便通知國民的，但在特攻隊來談，戰果並不是主要問題。只知道完成撞拼任務。所謂直接掩保護，不能顧名思義來判斷牠只是担任掩護的，但必要時也只有撞拼。現在談不到掩護機了。在飛機多的時候，固然有掩護機的，但現在用不着那樣奢侈和浪費地帶掩護機了，特攻機只知道向敵艦撞拼。一架飛機撞拼一艘軍艦這有點不合算了。某基地的S中尉曾說過，一架飛機住往炸毀一艘巡洋艦及一艘驅逐艦。S中尉殺氣沸騰地說：</p>
<p>「如不全部炸毀毀敵艦，是不能死的。這個戰法就呌作特別攻擊法吧！」</p>
<p>三村：當出擊前的一剎那，隊員們站在自已飛機的前面，手捧着圓圓的飯團子說：「到戰塲再吃吧！」另一個人不笑着說：「還是在此處吃吧！因為响午方能到戰塲，吃完再走吧：」吃的飯，旣無酒又無菜：談不到是酒席。心中覺得像到不遠的海邊去遠足一樣。</p>
<p>眞是對不身臨其境的人無法解釋，他們到戰塲去，以生命去換戰果，在撞拼犧牲前的一兩小時前，仍然還是心平氣和。一個隊長把自己心愛的刀交給整備班長，留下幾句話說：「在正是拿生命撞向敵人的，所以這把刀是用不着了」。他還說，寫違囑和不寫遺囑反正是一樣的，終於一字不留地這位少年無行兵出身的戰士飛走了。</p>
<p>渡邊：有時候跑到隊員去徵詢出擊前的感想，有一位年齡很小的少年飛行士很坦然地聲低回答說：「我什麼也不想」。這眞可以說視死如歸。於是我很感覺慚愧，爲什麽要問道樣笨問題。</p>
<p>空陸一體</p>
<p>岡府等：此外在基地上，空陸兩軍簡直可以說完全打成一片，毫無意見發生。飛行士收獲到那樣燦爛戰果，自然也需要分一部份功勞給日夜不息地繼續勞動工作的整備負。同時日本沒有充分飛機，而能最高度地利用了現在的飛機數量，這自然更是陸上整備員功勞。整備員在送走特攻隊出征前，是滿頭大汗地努力工作着，這只有令人五體投地地敬仰。</p>
<p>因爲夜間睡覺就沒有人作工，所以一聽到命令去整備飛機，就馬上跳起來去工作。敵機飛來時，就把飛機拖到安全地帶去，即從飛機場拖到很遠的掩蓋　裘去。整備員因爲日夜過於操勞，手臉上，以及全身上，汕汗一色，泥垢與皮膚不分，完全變成黑色。</p>
<p>近來因爲夜間攻擊及黎明攻擊增加起來，稍微睡覺的時間都沒有，夜間的整備工作特別增加起來了。敵人空襲下的夜間，由於不能點燈，所以工作時間就更延長了。整備用的資材，也因爲是在前綫上，當然不能浪費。如果有命令明天早晨特攻除將出動，則該夜的整備兵就決不可能睡眠了。駕駛員們很可憐他們，就把自己的食物分給整備員暫充夜一飯，但整備員們拒絕說：「出征的人才應當吃這份飯的」。整備兵還是忍受着飢苦在黑暗的飛機場之一角，手足忙亂地工作着。整備員，眞是令人敬佩</p>
<p>渡邊：專門保護英勇就義撞拼敵船的特攻隊的掩護戰鬥機，任務就是不分晝夜地保護特攻隊安全到目的戰場，掩護員的勞苦功高也不應忽略的。特攻機到來的時候就飛起來迎接，出擊的時候就擔任戒備。這批毫不知疲乏的掩護隊員們，面孔上長着一字鬚，在眼中放着炯炯的光綫。</p>
<p>重視飛機</p>
<p>岡府寺：作了四年之久的老空軍仍然還在基地上作工，這就是證明日本航空部隊的强處。敵人縱有大量飛機，但沒有駕駛員，於是便召集學生實行短期訓練，有時甚至縣實徵人，這比起我們日本來說，在人才方面敵人是眞不行的。但日本有這樣誇耀世界的優秀駕駛員，不能全體一下都當成特攻隊員，這是事實。有許多人很覺可惜，沒有當上特攻隊員，只好當普通飛行員。基地司令和飛行長往往苦心安慰這批普通飛行員要知道我的苦衷。你願意　拼去，用不着你嘴說出來，我早已知道的。但今日只能派出〇架飛機去，如果派你去，那末別的人豈不是一樣地要留下。你想對不？」</p>
<p>司令和飛行長每天都苦口婆心地對隊員們重複這些話。</p>
<p>渡邊：我們的基地也這樣。一批一批的飛機運來，同時來到基地的隊員如稍不愼飛機出了毛病，就命令他把飛機讓給別人。這個時候的他，是最感痛苦的。</p>
<p>「是再沒有比這更痛苦的了，所以往往不着陸一直飛上戰場。」</p>
<p>這是留下的駕駛員，眼眶中含着熱淚這樣說的。領到飛機的隊員們，揮動着附近女學生送來盛開的櫻花和樹枝，英勇地　開留　的基地，飛上了征途。基地上剩下的隊員們，當天氣惡劣的時候，認為飛機不能到達目的地，便跑到飛機塲去仰望天空，等候出征去的戰友歸來。這種情形，恰似接力賽跑一樣，在焦急地等候着先跑的人。飛機出了毛病而飛回來的隊員，讓整備兵收拾着，但自己也總不表離開這架飛機，時時發問：「還沒好麽？」由於整備兵不足，當宣佈這架飛機不能使用時，這個隊員就好像失去了知覺。</p>
<p>三村：這話非常對。我們那個基地每逢出征時，一遇到這種情形，就像你們的基地所發生的情形一樣。所以基地上的入們比後方的人們還愛飛機。第一次大攻勢開始的前夕，在特攻隊的宿舍裏，大家都包圍着參謀在談明天的攻擊戰法。決定戰法後，各隊長立刻傳達各自的特攻隊員。最後的命令便是「不要性急地糟塌飛機！」還有一句便是「如果　拼的條件不好，就平安飛回來！」這好像是母愛的另一形式，實際上這是指飛機而言的。困為特攻隊的信條，是「每架飛機都要好好愛護！」是以生命作炸彈衝向敵人的，如果浪費了這種寶貴的活炸彈，對基地說是一種損失。整備班長也有話說，「飛機出了毛病，這是我們應負的責任」。所以如果一架飛機出了毛病，則必須通夜工作，全體動員收拾妥當。</p>
<p>因為整備工作過於緊張，往往在夢中看到整備修理工作時，立刻跳起來者，每夜都有這樣幾個人。（譯自四月十八日朝日新聞）</p>
<h3>活躍北方基地的女機士們</h3>
<p>兩　掛着巨大炸彈的新銳機，發出一陣怒吼，　開基地，飛向北溟，前去搜索敵踪。用心整頓飛機的女機械士們，仰首凝　，遙送消失在　空彼方的愛機。</p>
<p>北方的戰局，也已急迫了。現在，日本東北各島敵機的空襲，已逐日激劇起來。女機械士們，憑着女性特有的靈　感覺，早就深深感到基地空氣的緊張急迫。</p>
<p>為國服務早具决心</p>
<p>「你們是在第一綫陣地服務的整備兵。你們修理整頓的飛機，是直接參加戰鬥的。假使它們中彈或大受損傷回來，你們應該立刻動手修理。對於你們，所以要施行嚴格的軍隊敎育，就是養成你們應付危急事熊的心理。」部隊長說。</p>
<p>其實呢，她們早就有了決心。過去在北千島上空與敵機拚撞而殉國北海的橫崎二郎少佐與成淸巖少尉，就是從這個基地出發的。她們含着滿　熱淚，歡送一去不返的勇士，立下決心，那怕鼻子凍掉，手脚凍傷，也要努力工作，正如部隊長所說，都是「整備的特攻隊員」，切實完成所負的任務。</p>
<p>工作優良熱情洋溢</p>
<p>這個部隊開始採用女機械士，憶是三年前的事情，迄今已有隊員〇〇名。她們戴着星章的戰鬥　，穿着一色的制服，凛凛然不愧是一支娘子军。去年十二月以挺身隊資格入隊的隊員，現在已成為很好的機械士，成績的優良，使敎官稱贊不置。經她們的織手修理整頓的新銳機，現在活躍於東北第一綫上。</p>
<p>短期間內能有這樣可驚的成績，大半由於她們的熱情。此外則當歸功於部隊長的適宜敎育了。即於「常在第一綫」的氛圍中，實行軍隊敎育，同時授以徹底的基本技術敎育。</p>
<p>「在軍隊裏工作，和在工廠內製造飛機不同。旣已入伍，雖然是女性，也該做一個優良的士兵。這是我常常告誡她們的·在她們入隊以後，第一個星期內就是敎她們立正，舉手禮，注目　，快步行進及密集敎練，使她們在軍事敎練中體會軍隊的滋味，領悟軍人的精神。對於女人最大的缺點，就是說話　　，也努力設法　正，使她們養成言語　明的軍人口吻。等到她們領會軍人的眞精神以後，就開始將基本的技術敎授她們。她們原很熱心，但基本的技術是很重要的，即使是小小的一個釘，如果釘得不得法，也可引起飛機在空中分解的危險。無論怎樣微小之點，若不中式，使影響飛機的性能。因此，在她們入隊一個月內，將各基本技術知識充分敎授她們，從飛機的飛行原理一直到飛機的構造，性能，處理方法，就見一根小管，也必由講義和實物說明其功用。由於這種徹底的敎育，結果是獲了得預料以上的成效。」</p>
<p>正如部隊長所說，在震耳欲　的隆隆聲中，穿着油污的制服，披着　鬆短髮的隊員，正全神貫注地一心修理成裝配鋼板，齒輪，昇降舵，方向　等艘體的重要部分。入隊以來不到四個月，她們已學會了基本技術，所敵的工作，成績絲　不亞於男子。</p>
<p>利用假日巡迥歌唱</p>
<p>爲了養成她們不畏任何困難的氣魄以及「常在戰塲」的心理起見，除出每月二次的演習以外，並定每星期三爲劍道日，以資奬勵隊員練習武技。最近，爲了提高工作效率，並與以正當娛樂起見，由部隊長的主持，組成了口琴隊，同時還組織了一們合唱隊，利用休假之日，巡迴各工作塲，歌唱「陸軍」，「加　隼戰門隊」，「航空日本」，「愛國之花」等歌曲，在這紀律嚴明的基地上，平添無限的生氣。士兵們都一心等待着這個口琴合唱隊光臨。</p>
<p>平時、從上午七時半到下午五點鐘，除出午前午後各休息十五分鐘以外，她們是不停地工作着的。她們毫不感到疲勞，甚至每月兩天的假日也情願不要，因爲她們要用自己的手愛護着捍衛祖國北方天空的飛機。（自共，鈴木兩特派員）（譯自四月四日每日新聞）</p>
<h3>論學校防空工作</h3>
<p>— 江瑜</p>
<p>本市防空工作在當局積極倡導之下，已有不少放就，如交通管制，緊急待避訓練，燈火管制，普遍建築街道防空壕，組織各保甲區之消防隊等等，惟以各學校，職業，機關，工廠，團體以及各里弄爲單位之內部防空工作，則迄今尚未見切實進行，因此在空襲時仍有許多混亂現象發生：如聚集晒台屋頂觀望，不遵守交通管制規約，任意將燈光外洩等等。筆者服務學校，曾目覩敝校學生在敵機擲彈時秩序紛亂，四處逃竄，女同學中且有不少哭呌者，此說明市民尚缺乏防空之基本常　，爲使全市市民能沉　應付今後敵機之濫炸計，竊以爲各機關學校及各里弄應迅速建築各項防空　備及普遍實行市民防空訓練，而尤以後者爲刻不容綏之工作。</p>
<p>目前上海之大中學校約二百所左右，小學校則更比比皆是，此等學校若因今後轟炸頻繁而停辦，殊非積極辦法，學校當局當前之中心課題，應爲如何使敎育適合今後之戰爭環靖，現僅就學校之防空工作，略陳私見於后：</p>
<p>（甲）各校應設立一防空指導機構，籌劃各該校一切防空事務，其中首要者如：</p>
<p>在校內或附近建築一個或若干能容納全校員生之安全防空壕。</p>
<p>開辦有關防空急救常識之講習班。</p>
<p>加緊全校緊急待避訓練。</p>
<p>組織防空急救隊，糾察隊。</p>
<p>集急救用之藥品，器械等。</p>
<p>（乙）各校防空　構之主持者應為校長或校長代表，並應請敎員及學生代表參加，以收全校一致行動之效。</p>
<p>（丙）為使工作順利進行，可採取下列辦法：　敦請本巿防空本部派員來校指導，　與學校所在地區之保甲防空機構取得密切聯絡，以便互相協的交換經騐，　與學校毘鄰之機關居民合作。</p>
<p>至於防空用之經費，可以募捐等方式　　之，惟一切賬目須絕對公開，以防流弊。</p>
<p>然欲求防空工作之眞正實效，還在於日常之指導與訓練，務使全校學生得於短期內具備防空之初步常識與訓練，另一方面學生不能藉口空襲危險而荒廢學業，應自動積極參加本校及本區之各項防空服務（如掘防空壕，救護隊，糾察隊，担架隊等，）如此則不僅可減少敵機轟炸所受之損害，且能使學業不受影響繼續上課。</p>
<p>靑年學生爲社會之中堅，應本推己及人之精神，推動全市市民積極參加防空訓練。</p>
<p>最後，切望本市防空本部及目前成立之戰時臨時難民救濟會之負責當局，速即注意並籌劃全市更深入之防空工作、俾得應付日益頻繁與嚴重化之空襲。</p>
<h3>本巿西區與北站間交通問題  沈熙樑</h3>
<p>上月廿三日報載：「本市建設局有　於北站附近交通向稱頻繁，尤其日前往來車輛擁擠，原有道路，寛度不足，行旅頗感不便，因有南北各區闢一直達北站之幹路之說」。　將管見所及，略述如後：</p>
<p>一·向來至北站，必須經由北浙江路或北河南路；上述二路，路面甚狹，且爲中心區域，車輛擁擠，行走頗感不便，往日尚有十八路及十四路無軌電車可直達北站，而今停駛，全恃人力車及三輪車，是故更形不便。蘇州河自　袋角至此·迂迴曲折，形或一河套，是故沿河各路如新閘路北京路，亦隨之迂迴。而一般住於滬西各區之市民，往北站者，必須經新閘路北京路而由浙江路折入北站，路途遙遠，無異兜一大圈子。徵請幾何學上所謂二點之間直綫最近；因特建議：若能於勞勃生路盡頭蘇州河上，建築橋樑一座，開闢幹路一條，貫穿廣肇山莊，與廣肇路啣接，經大統路新民路，而直達北站，此路雖非直機，然與直綫亦相差無幾。所費僅築一橋樑，與闢一小段馬路耳！其予西區市民，便利甚多，自可不用經由浙江路或河南路至北站。上述二路擁擠情形可形減少，故此路之闢，有莫大之價値焉。</p>
<p>二·若謂此橋樑之築，將費不貲，則更有一簡省之辦法：即利用卡德路底原有之麥根路橋（現時不通），稍加修理，而由恒豐路經　通路新民路而直達北站，亦便利甚多。</p>
<p>茲提出上列二點：以供常局參考，如一且實現，與西區市民，實有莫大之便利焉。</p>
<h3>社會福利局職業指導所</h3>
<p>— 家熙</p>
<p>上海近年來的工商業已由畸形繁榮而趨入蕭條。去年舊暦年底政府機關以及工商界均有普遍裁員的現象，工商業方面之普遍停頓與緊縮，促使失業人數日益增加，無論他們學識技能如何優良，服務道德如何高超，仍舊無法謀得職位，小而言之，是社會不安寗和紊亂的囚素，大而言之，更是整個國家的損失，所以，對於此項問題，實在不能予以忽視。</p>
<p>對於此項問題一般人似乎並未予以重視，以上海之大，失業人員之衆，而處理此項問題者，僅只社會福利局附屬之職業指導所一處，記者走訪該所所長楊崇　君，承詳告該所辦理介紹職業情形。然令人感覺奇異者，失業人數雖日見增加但往職業介紹所求職者並不十分踴躍，（詳數列後），其原因據楊君言，不外下列數點：</p>
<p>該所偏處西隅（地址在永康路即舊雷米路二百號）不能普遍爲一般人所知曉。</p>
<p>失業者明知裁員乃普遍之情形，即或登記，亦未必有多大之希望。</p>
<p>最近被裁之失業者，大多可領得一筆整數之解散費或退職金，有一部份趁此歸返原籍，有一部份則藉此作投資或小本經營。</p>
<p>失業者　覺薪水階級總無法維特生活，故雖被解散，亦不再謀職業，亦不再謀職業，而寗願走單帮或擺　頭，收入或較有辦法。</p>
<p>凡屬專門技術人才，至職業介紹所登記，該所必盡力介紹予各有關工商機關，或派員分訪，作口頭上之推荐，然而能成就者，不過百分之三四而已。一方面因由於戰爭期間對於建築，土木，機械械等人才暫無需要，另一方面亦由於此項人才個性不易隨和，或降格以求，所以此項人才之介紹成功者特別少。</p>
<p>茲將該所近二月之求職人數，徵聘人數，及介紹成就者人數抄錄於下。</p>
<p>二月份　男　女　總計求職者　六四四　一六〇　八〇四徵聘者　九七　三七　一三四介紹成就者　四〇　二〇　六〇</p>
<p>三月份　求職者　三九〇　一三八　五二八徵聘者　四七　二二　六九介紹成就者　三〇　一四　四四</p>
<p>來職業指尋所徵求之人才，以練習生，工役，學徒爲最多，其次則爲學校敎師，會計，打字，推銷員等，至於捨私人介紹而公開徵求之動　，則不外下列數種：</p>
<p>需要眞正優秀人才，於職業指導所之詳細介紹中，可於被介紹之一羣中，鄭重選擇其優秀</p>
<p>不願接受　　號股東等有關人員之情面介紹，並爲避免開罪任何一人起見，故寗願委託介紹機關公開介紹。</p>
<p>待遇微薄，在短時期內不易聘得。</p>
<p>工作性質比較專門，親友方面私人介紹者恐不能勝任愉快。</p>
<p>登記手續，則非常簡單，求職者只須親往該所塡寫登記表二張，隨即由該所人員就所塡各項詳予詢問，從登記者之談話中察看其舉動，能度，個性，興趣及學識能力等，並作一簡單的記錄，以備作徵求者選擇人才時之參考，然後將登記表甲依其希望或能勝任之職務分類歸入登記卡之箱內，以便徵求者需要何項人才即可於分類中選擇之。再將登記表乙依其姓名之筆　編爲號碼，按次置入登記卡箱，以便下次該登記者再來接洽時，即可在數秒鐘內尋出，作接洽談話時之根據</p>
<p>至於來所徵求人才者，先塡寫求人表，詳細塡明其所需要人才之條件及待遇，然後在甲種登記表卡中根據其條件逐一交由徵求者自行選擇。由該所寄發通知單約期接洽，再由該所詳細加以考核後，備函介紹至徵求者方面，由徵求者在五六人中再選擇一人。</p>
<p>介紹成就後，半年後，該所必徵詢僱傭雙方意見，如有參差之處，由該所居中調整。如雇主對被介紹人有指摘處，亦由該所負　向該被介紹人談話，加以勸吿或糾正、務使雙方滿意而後止。</p>
<p>此項手續，職業介紹所方面不收分文費用、蓋純屬爲社會服務爲社會福利也。</p>
<p>該所工作除介紹職業外，另設立改業指導職業指導就業指導各部門，如有對現有職業不滿而企圖改就他業者，必加以種種勸說，務使求本位上之努力向上而力謀樂業。對於方由學校踏入社會之擇業者，則指導其擇業之途徑及準備，謀得職業後，亦必指導其服務上應具有之態度及要點，以免得而復失。於每届寒暑假期間，對各級學校畢業生，該所亦盡力予以擇校選科等之指導。</p>
<p>據楊君談：該所之兩大宗旨，為　使無業者有業；　使有業者樂業。楊君復發表對於救濟失業之意見三點。</p>
<p>趁此疏散人口遷移工廠內地設小型工廠之機會，舉辦失業者總登記，登記性質，可分技術人才，技術工人及普通工人三種，以作移殖內地工廠招工之準備。</p>
<p>由政府籌募鉅款，充作失業者小本貸金之基金，俾失業者得有資本作小本經營之機會。</p>
<p>趁此囤戶大量出　，各公司商店營業蕭條之際，組織救濟失業販賣團，凡屬需要出售之貨物，均可由販賣團經售，販賣員由主持者加以考査，覓具保證，販賣所得除成本及應得利潤外，餘均分配於販賣人，俾得維持其最低生活。</p>
<p>關於職業指導及介紹機關，在歐美及日本　國家極為重視，且已普及設立。我國方面戰前只中華職業敎育社，戰後本市各民營之職業介紹機關，截至目前止，除靑年會之職業　導名義上尙存在外，餘均停辦。由政府舉辦者，亦只此一所。據聞該所經常費由社會福利部補助，每月五萬元，職員僅三人，每人月薪僅得七八千元，（膳宿自理），名義上雖屬市政府社會福利局，然並無補助，該所前售計劃舉辦樂業運動升學就業指導運動等項，祗以經費關係，亦無法實現。</p>

<h3>債</h3>
<p>— 霜晨</p>
<p>堯兒病了！</p>
<p>病得很利害，是急性的肺炎，小嘴巴裏喘着氣，眼珠子的活動呆滯了，兩隻小手兒握得緊緊地向胸前痙孿着，兩爿小嘴唇由玫瑰色變成紫，變成白，變成黑了；祗有八個足月的孩子，怎末能當得起這樣的病勢？於是全家的人亂了，妻咽着淚，措手措足，顫抖地喊着：「這，怎麽辦：呀？」我的心更恐慌，更不知所措，儘在屋子裏兜圈兒，不知所云地口中喃喃着不知說些什麼話。</p>
<p>孩子的小手痙　了一陣，似乎好些了，　在小牀上，面色是慘白的，微微短促的呼吸，小眼半開半現地…正在和他的小生命搏鬥，掙扎。我不忍看這個可憐的樣子，這時我眞恨自已力量的薄弱和渺小，連一個小孩子都無法救治；更恨不得即刻化身代替了孩子，孩子的疾病立時移在自己的身上，孩子的一切的苦痛由我自已來承當，忍受。但這些究屬空想，於事實無補，對孩子的病更不會減輕分毫。</p>
<p>妻用手心貼一貼孩子的額角，吐出了這麼一句話：「得很！」繼着愁苦的臉向我埋怨着：「喂，想想法子呀！這樣下去終不是辦法。」妻的話使我淸醒了，提醒我立刻找醫生的念頭，本來生病找醫生是頂要緊的問題，也是頂尋常的問題，但是我被兒的病急壞了，反忘掉這宗最緊要的事。</p>
<p>「找醫生」是想到了，但繼着的問題又來了，第一是找那一位醫生？第二是請醫生的錢呢？第一個問題終于在千求敎，萬打聽之下，有了下落，我們決定請一位有着豐富經騐的小兒科專家陳醫師。但是出診費大得很，加着針藥等費構成在窮措大眼裏一　驚人的數目，也即是構成最難解的第二個錢的問題了！</p>
<p>暗暗地和妻商量着：以前所積蓄的一點錢，已儘量購了柴米——這日漲夜大又每天脫不掉它們的東西，餘下的一些零錢又得安置了日常家用，除此之外實在沒有多餘的，何况一筆數目和當浩大的醫藥費呢？現在唯一的辦法只有向人家在借錢，但是向誰去借？借得着？借不着？又是一連串難於解決的問題，我儘量在腦幕上搜索又搜索，但搜索的結果終歸於一個「〇」。在我周圍平日够得上交情的熟朋友，都和我一般，或者還及不上我，都是吃死飯的薪給階級，都在生活煎逼下磨難着，偸生着，大天打發着因苦的日子，對明日的生活發生着驚嘆號，眞的，連自身的活命問題時時在受威脅，更何想分一點餘錢來帮人家？至於說一般曾有過一面之綠或者是「高攀」的友朋，當然第一是够不上交情，難於啓齒；第二我又不會「鑽」，「奉迎」，「吹拍」……這些謀生和得發的技能。否則也不會因孩子的一點病就要這末樣地憂念和貧迫了！可是孩子的是病非醫治不可的，錢自然更非籌不可，於是在無辦法中免强想辦法，即是與妻合作着分頭去借錢。妻的錢路只有向自己娘家去商量，但是妻和兩舅嫂間的感情素來並不和睦，現在迫她去幹這件手而子的借貸的事，在妻子平素矜持顏面的人是如何一件爲難的事呵—但爲了孩子，或是說是母愛的力址，居然意外地同意了。我只得向窮朋友處去一遭，雖然我知道這是徒勞往返的，留下的孩子祗得托隣居的一位老媽子暫時看領着。</p>
<p>出門走第一步路，我的心就亂得一團糟，到底先找那一位？在一度籌劃，甚酌的結果，只得向一位路程較近生活狀况尚佳的K君處進發，但是一進門我的希望就給粉碎了，K君病倒在牀上，他的太太守在爐畔煎藥，她絮絮地訴說着她丈夫的的病已有一星期了，兒女們擠在一屋了大哭小喊，物件凌亂地堆滿屋角顯見得K君的病勢非輕，與近况的潦倒。當我看到K君的一臉愁容，見勢反不得不上前先安慰一番，這樣就匆匆告辭了。繼着我又找了幾位窮朋友，但都見到他們的窮和窘境，便失掉我向他們借貸的勇氣，其實即使我向他們開口，他們在自顧不暇的境况下也不會滿足我些許的希望的。最後我一個不願想的念頭在我腦間迴旋着，我的一位小學的同窗C君，現在已是暴發戶並兼顯赫的社會紅人了，雖然我們間的意見不合，志趣不投，但憑了六年同窗之誼，告貸一點錢想來終不至於遭拒的，可是要我低頭去幹這種「事與願違」的事件該是如何的不願！但爲了錢，爲了孩子的病，終於我的足不自主地在輝煌地C公館門前着踟蹰着，我鼓足第三次的勇氣然後去按門鈴。門開了，出來一位傲慢的門房，對我全身打量着，我勉強允　投上一名刺，並述來意，他　懶地引我入會客室，並不十分招呼我，就直接進去了。我　觫的站在屋角，從着衣鏡裏看到自己瘦削憔悴的面容，　　的衣衫，處在宏敝富　的大厦是如何的不調和呵！門房投我以疑慮的目光是必然的事了。我等待着，等待着，好久門房出來了，我整整衣，預備會闊別多年的舊友，但門房却冷冷地回道：「老爺不在家。」我只得掃興辭出，臨行我留在卡片上說明明日再訪的話，在再三要求下門房終於免強接受了。半日的奔波，結果一無成績可言，對於浪費我許多的精力，時間，我一點沒有怨憾；但對孩子的病，醫治孩子病的錢，却無有着洛，倒是很憂急萬分的。這樣思索着，我走路的腿軟了，腦子裏爆發着閃閃地火星，頭暈得利害，差不多要倒下地來，我用全身的精力堅持着，抵抗着，但我危危欲墮的身子，時而左右傾側着，我的步子也緩下來了，這時我猛然被一部「鳴，嗚，嗚，」地汽車聲驚醒，趕快讓在路旁，車就滑過去了。但是我突然看到車中坐着的西裝男子，正是我要見的C君，偕着一位妖俏的女郞，遺留在車後的是一串浪而蕩的嬉笑。這時我即想趕上去招呼他，但車子已閃電般地飛逝了，突然我又回顧C公館的門離我還不多遠，可以斷定這輛車是剛由這個公館裏出來的，於是我即醒悟到他是有意拒見我的，我呆呆地站在路上，痴想着，痴想着，「道義」……「人情世故」……「錢」……「朋友」……等字眼都雜亂的在腦幕上複映，交織。但是沒有得到一個頭緒。我覺得我是被侮辱了，我立刻回到C公館，討回了那張名片，當塲撕掉了那上面的留語。這種恥辱加在我身上，即潑盡西江之水，也不足以洗刷淸楚的！我瞪瞪門房，用沈重的步伐返家了！</p>
<p>但當我到家時，部如一隻敗陣的公鷄，拖着　喪而遲緩的步子，我用千鈞的力量路遇家的門檻，做父親的責任是什麽﹖對孩子的病又有什麽交代？而回來的却是兩手空空，一無辦法的一個可憐虫，而屬於可憐虫的孩子更是可憐，我眞不忍再想下去……。</p>
<p>但是出於意外的，我一進屋子即見人頭擠滿一屋，醫生來了，岳母來了，妻匆忙地應付着，垚兒已打了兩針血淸，一針葡萄汁，再飲了一點藥水，巳經能安靜的人睡了！</p>
<p>醫生在任務畢後匆匆去了，錢是由妻付的，當然是從岳母借來的。</p>
<p>這時岳母習慣地鼓起她的簧舌，嘮叨地訴說着：「怎麽不早打電話給我呀，唉！不應該將孩子弄成這個樣子！有病應早請醫啊！還好，現在看孩子的病大概還不要緊…」這樣婆婆媽媽地碎語，在平日聽來勢必引起我的討厭，或者甚而跑開不睬她，但是現在聽時覺得異樣的親切有味，甚至我因而覺得人間有溫暖，同時由于剛才所受的氣忿，阻撓，混雜着目前的感激銘心。一股由心暴發的熱淚，不覺滾滾淌下，我即忙暗暗拭去。</p>
<p>孩子的病再經過兩次的診斷，二星期的調理，病勢日漸起色了！而爲父親的債却漸漸纍築起來由小石子堆而變成一座小山了，這些錢自然都岳母一人手裏來的，岳母的家境也不見佳，這些錢又自然從他處轉移而來的。我不知將來怎樣來報答她？同時我又不敢想：兩位舅嫂背後又不知說些怎末樣的閑話﹖妻的顏面從今而後更談不到維特？而更不知累這老人家在婆媳問又費了多少的口舌？啊啊！我眞不敢連續的想下去呢！</p>
<p>現在孩子的病算好全了，能立在我膝上逗着笑樂，牙牙地，小嘴巴掛着天眞無邪的笑容，兩隻小手亂向空中劃着，劃着，妻笑着說：「這條小性命是拾來的，好險呀！」我也和着笑，但笑中有眼淚，從　裏告訴我，我的面容更　削，憔悴了許多，有時深夜警醒，覺得有什麽事還沒有做好的？繼着我想到了「債」上它如壓在我心頭的千斤石，壓榨着，壓榨着；又如千萬　小　子在我心壁着，　着，吮吸着…於是使我永</p>
<p>從現在起我眞怕見「」更不知怎樣去還法？啊啊！以後的日子，孩子！「債」！「生活」！怎麽辦？不說也罷！</p>
<h3>為工作而犧牲</h3>
<p>— 白丁</p>
<p>犧牲，如此的犧牲麽？你底血不曾流在沙塲，你底汗又未沾濕了征襖，可是，遼關的人海裏，你竟這樣默默地沉淪了，人們底記憶中，你的影子漸漸淡漠了，犧牲的意義，可以是這般的偉大，又可以是這般的渺小麽？</p>
<p>遺忘，你竟輕輕地被人遺忘了。星星之火燎燼了你底生命之原，剩下來的；祗是一片冷灰，一陳風！叫人怎樣的不忍遺忘，可是又怎樣的容易遺忘啊？！</p>
<p>死了，你就這樣的死了？我望着你輾轉呻吟，可是一剎那；你爲何奄奄的無聲了？生與死的界限呵！看來是多麼的接近，又看來是多麽的遙遠呀！……</p>
<p>淸晨走過十六號病房，不習慣地，瞥見那只高高架起的空床，像上解剖學時的那副人體骨骼；空凌凌的。慘淡燈光下的那個灰色人影又在腦際浮起了——</p>
<p>L君的病，大家都知是沒有希望了的，道可怕的末期肺結核，所以他的死耗的傳出，沒有叫人成到突兀，因爲他的不死，人們並沒有當他活着，只是護士早上多舖一只床，給藥時多取兩片鈣爾錫姆醫生走過機械地翻一下〇Bart，一天，二天，一年，二年，叫人太習慣了，似乎沒有這件事，沒有這個人。直到少鋪了只床，拿去了張藥牌子，Chart除下了；這才覺着發生了件事——打破了習慣——他們說：「哦，死了！」似乎有些惋惜，可是他們又笑着去做別的事了；還有許多床要舖，還有給藥，打針等……他們忙着在各種細菌之問穿來穿去的工作着，像L君從前一樣的工作着。可是結核菌叫L君休息了，永遠的休息！</p>
<p>江海關的大鐘响了十下，照我還沒下班，但是眼睛可有些睜不開了。桌子上攤着本雜誌，結果一個字也看不進去，電鈴突然响了起來，是十六號病房，L君的姊姊輕輕對我說：「人不行了，口中亂說亂話，我覺得有點怕，請你陪陪我。」我一口答應了，帶了只口罩，在L君的床旁，我們倆呆呆地站着。</p>
<p>確是有點害怕，L君眼請睜得老大的；在深凹的眼眶裏轉動着，眼光遲鈍的從左面慢慢移到右面，又從窗口慢慢的移到門口，那樣子委實有點叫人冷汗涔涔，細長的手，不，祗是根枯柴罷了；抖抖的暨起來，朝着門外，他開始動起兩片木木的唇；「看，兩個人來了！」我們跟着向門外看去去；那見來的人呢？但又似乎那兩個看不見的人進來了，L君舉着兩隻臂，搖着，指着，點着，嘴唇吃力地動着，好像跟那兩人在談話，似乎又說着英語，我好奇的近前去聽聽，可是二句也沒聽淸楚，那可怕的眼珠竟慢慢的移到我的面上來了，「你……你……」他對着我說了兩個字眼　　直的停着，我不禁　然，倒退了兩步。「閉上眼睛吧，不要瞎想，姊姊在你身邊呢。」他姊姊放平了他的手，牽了牽被單，抖聲地說，「哦……你……你三姊……」他似乎淸醒了些，無力地合上眼皮。我輕聲的响L小姐：「你是他的三姊？」「不，三姊不在上海，他……他連我也認不淸了……」她用手絹擦去眼淚，沒有哭出來，她也是個護士。室中靜得很，只有L君出而不進的呼氣聲，使我們的神經緊張着，咕咕的似乎喉頭有許多痰，拿着痰杯給他吐，他卻還知道吐，可是無力吐出來；我們把他的頭側轉，又吐不出，注意到他的眼黑，漸潮的向上，向上，最後剩下眼白，眼皮半垂着，口却張得那麽大，白的牙露在外面，L小姐放下痰杯，拉了我的手，悽聲的哭了出來，我能用什麽話安慰她呢？我自己的眼珠，亦早浸濕在淚水中了，「沒有辦法，上海祇我一個人了，請他們包起來，抬到太平間去吧！我……我明早來……來收屍……」她掩着面，跑到走　裏去了</p>
<p>一回頭，那慘淡燈光下的灰色屍影，竞叫我膽小起來，趕緊關上屛風，跑去報告醫生。</p>
<p>醫生來聽過了心臟，許多同路亦都來了，　然裏，白被單包着的L君，給工人們抬出了十六號病房……。</p>
<h3>流星</h3>
<p>— 白帆</p>
<p>深夜的流星有惑人的美麗那慧黠的眸光使人悲哀，心，為他長遍了憂鬱的靑苔，蘇隙間，遏不住渴慕的火花。是甚麽魅力使人太息？光芒，點燃了春的眼。呵，聰明的，別被嘲笑了！炫麗的流星，是浪漫，孤傲，而那離奇的一笑，使人惶亂。當他，疾掠過黝暗的夜空，凄風裏，衰草沉痛地低吟；笑吧，聰明的，該如寒枝般冷漠，而顫慄的心，且藏入幽谷深處為流星，那惑人的美麗而哭泣。</p>
<h3>浮萍輯</h3>
<p>— 陸汶</p>
<p>海內存知己，天涯若比鄰。—王勃—</p>
<p>序言</p>
<p>人們常會把人世間的聚散比作浮萍，如果這此擬是確當的話，那我將更喜愛浮萍。爲了在最近，在異常偶然的機會中，我重逢了三位人物，而在當初離別的時節，誰也沒想到會有再見的日子的。爲此，寫下了一些，替自已，也替別人。</p>
<p>一：先生</p>
<p>電車在一個站頭上停了以後，又擠進來一批客人。其中一位一隻手挾着一個大皮包而另一隻手正在掏錢的時候，電車開了，車身一震，那位客人倒在一位坐着的乖客—我身上。</p>
<p>於是我合上正在看着的一本雜誌，抬起頭來。</p>
<p>『對不起，對不起。』</p>
<p>可是，沒等他道歉完，我巳經叫起來：</p>
<p>「啊呀！馬先生！」</p>
<p>我站起身來，拿位子讓給他。</p>
<p>「讓我想想……」他坐了下來：『你是Y中的是不是？…你好像叫陸…陸……」</p>
<p>「陸維報！」我站在他面前，像了個小孩子：「馬先生不認識了。」</p>
<p>「認識的，認識的。」馬先生愉快地笑起來：「不過，這幾年來，我的腦子越弄越不如以前了。」</p>
<p>一點不含糊，馬先生是位好先生，我唸Y中的時候，他敎我們大代數和三角，解釋得可眞叫淸楚。爲了他同時在六隻學校裘敎，時間關係，他的課常排在末一節之後，六點到七點的時候，可是我們都等着上課，沒人逃走。</p>
<p>「馬先生現在吃飯還是在電車上吃麽？」我突然想起一件事。</p>
<p>「是的。眞沒辦法。…有時候電車沒有，只好兩條腿跑。」</p>
<p>望着那位先生花白的頭髮，（頭項處已經有點秃了。）我感到沒有話可說。—是的，我還能說些什麽呢？</p>
<p>「你現在在什麼地方？」半响，他抬起頭來問。</p>
<p>『在一個中學裏敎算術。』我嚅嚅地回答。我覺得在那位先生面前我將是不足稱道的。</p>
<p>可是這却引起了他的感慨：</p>
<p>「時間眞快，你也敎到中學了。」</p>
<p>『馬先生現在在…？」我插進去，想打破難堪的氣氛。</p>
<p>「我？我還是那幾隻學校裹混。」白髮的老先生不勝唏噓：「還是依然故我。一班一班送他們從初中升到高中，給他們者試，送他們畢業，進大學。…再將新的一批從初中送進高中…」</p>
<p>「馬先生眞是誨人不倦……』</p>
<p>說不上，生活逼人，否則誰又情願一天到晚東奔西走？…聽說以前Y中的劉先生，最近做了幾次西藥，近千萬了。…我却就不行，到如今依然是「一事無成兩發斑」……」</p>
<p>電車停了，馬先生匆忙地立起來</p>
<p>「我到了，有空到我家裏來談談，我很想聽聽你是怎樣敎算術的？」</p>
<p>望着人行道上那個白髮的老敎師的影子，有一陣異樣的感觸自心頭浮起。</p>
<p>二：老同學</p>
<p>在一個雜誌上看到一位老同學的名字，發一回痴心，寫了一封信去問，半個月後接到回信，我的信沒有白寫。這眞是一件誰也沒想到的事，一個家鄉小學五年級時候的同學，一別十年，會在兵荒馬亂裏再碰到一塊。而且，這是一個多奇異的遇合呵！</p>
<p>那位同學在信末寫着：</p>
<p>「…半月後弟爲雜誌事或將來滬一行，</p>
<p>届時當造府奉訪，促膝暢談別後情形也。……」</p>
<p>我懷着一顆熱烈的心希望着。</p>
<p>不是不到半個月，我又接到一封信：</p>
<p>「……日來俗務紛繁，栗碌終日，幾無閒暇，滬上之行，只好打消，重逢之期，俟諸異日可也。……」</p>
<p>我想起人生的聚散原像浮萍，像飛絮，分別十年再碰到一塊究竟不常見的，是不是？那個詩人杜甫怎麽說</p>
<p>「人生不相見，動如參與商。」</p>
<p>就如那位老同學吧，小五年級我只跟他同學過一學期，就跳進了初中。而在學校裏的時期，也並非知已，普通同學而已，分別時候，當然更說不上什麽話別之類，固然孩子們根本不懂那回事，而且不怎麼一來就分別了。</p>
<p>「這十年來將把一個人變成怎樣了呢？」</p>
<p>當年他是被呌着「模範生」的，「模範生」的意義包括功課好，簿子寫得整潔，聽老師話，上課挺胸坐着，和手指甲常常剪之類。</p>
<p>「如今還是如此麼？」我想。</p>
<p>我不知道我們是否有機會再見面，人生的散聚原像斷梗浮萍。不過，如果這類事實究竟是不常有的話，我也滿意於目前的收獲。感謝綠衣的使溝，爲離人寄一點想思，那麼，就讓我們懷着這一顆希望的心一直到永遠吧。</p>
<p>在一個馬路的轉角上，我碰到一個兩年前辦義校時候的一個學生。</p>
<p>爲了讓一輛卡車，他從一輛破舊的自行車上跳下來。</p>
<p>那孩子茫然地抬起頭，向四面找來：</p>
<p>「咦，陸先生！」</p>
<p>『你現在在什麼地方？』我突然感到這句話不妥當，除了義務學校，他不會像某些學生一樣轉來轉去的。於是立刻改了口：「你現在做什麼事？」</p>
<p>『踏米。』他指指他的那輛車子：『每天到北新涇或者七實去踏。』</p>
<p>「你爹呢﹖—怎麽會要你去踏？」</p>
<p>「藝去年死了，鑽鐵絲網，給打傷了，回來睡了三天，——」</p>
<p>『你能踏多少米呢？」我望望他那輛破舊的車子。</p>
<p>「大概可以踏一石多，有時候可以踏兩石。我的一個爺叔本事比我大，他會踏三石。」</p>
<p>「三石？這部車子怎麽擺法？」</p>
<p>「喏，這樣擺！』他做着手勢：</p>
<p>「這邊掛一石，這邊掛一石，上面再堆一石。」</p>
<p>「你的妹妹呢？」我記起他還有一個妹妹，當初唸三年級的。</p>
<p>「妹妹﹖她現在跟着媽媽賣小菜。——陸先生，你有沒有錶？現在幾點鐘了？」</p>
<p>『十一點半。』我說。</p>
<p>「那麼，我要走了，人家還在那面等我呢？陸先生再會。」</p>
<p>「再會，」我看着他跳上車子。</p>
<p>該多慚愧，這麽一個孩子，已經拿生活擔子擱在自己身上了，而他，這個最多不過十四歲的孩子，他一點也沒有懼怕，走着人們要他走的路。</p>
<p>我想起在學校裏，吳海雄這孩子是常使先生們頭痛的。上課他不聽；功課，他不做；常常引起爭吵的是他；考試時候作弊的也是他；——</p>
<p>而如今，看吧，他是變成怎樣了。</p>
<p>你可知道，綱鐵是怎樣鍊成的？怎樣鍊成的呢？</p>

<h3>靑少年和靑年節</h3>
<p>— 邵鈺剛</p>
<p>在春風蕩漾的季節里，我們終於又等到了靑年節。</p>
<p>這苦難刦重的亞細亞的古國，在近代史中，昔負了民族苦重的命運，踏着火災人禍，外侵內　，從一八三八年的鴉片戰爭起，巳經有一百〇七年了。</p>
<p>處於這樣兵連禍結，國疲民貧的境况下，年靑的中華兒女，一代賡績一代，跨越着兩個世紀，嚐盡了甜酸苦辣，在最艱辛的精神物質條件下，肩荷着祖先遺留下來未了的歷史義務——那些早該掃除的新底世世紀的滿途上的荆棘——和辛亥革命運動以來未竟的革命偉業。我們的上幾代，不過祇做了些浮華空洞的虛事，艱難而巨大的實際工作，却給留下來了，這是很根深蒂固冥頑不靈的，但是他的子孫，眼看着祖國危殆，終於硬朗地不顧它有多少沉重棘手，快速的幹起來了。</p>
<p>鴉片戰爭，敲開了這個衰老朝代的大門，劃時代的掀舉了整個中華子孫全面反對國際白色人種侵擾國土的第一次的衛國旗職；一八四九年轟轟烈烈的太平天國革命運動，顯現出年靑一代，反抗黑暗封建勢力强韌無邊的心力；武昌城下的辛亥起義和革命軍的北伐成功，更表現出我們優秀的黃帝子孫，對於新的中國底燦爛前途的推進，是眞具有多大的不可抗拒的力量！</p>
<p>我們年靑的一代，是在兇惡猛烈的砲火底下分婏；是在前扑後繼的先烈血漬之中壯長，靑少年們已經鍛鍊得很英勇了，再也不懼怕的，他將會碰到怎麼樣的巨大的困難，雖然中國還在戰鬥當中，還沒有衝出這黑的莽原，還有許多顚簸磨難，安排在道路上，但終於被廓淸和排除的，二十世紀四十年代的中國靑少年是應該自傲的，歷史的規律指定了他們——將為成大東亞的完遂戰爭，促成和平的偉大的戰鬥員和旗手。他是應該怎樣抱着絕大信心，踏着鐵蒺藜向前進？！</p>
<p>中國的命運是多舛的；中國的靑年是苦難的，百年以來是受盡外族的欺凌和禮敎的壓制，於是乎早熟的中國靑少年們，終於站立起來說自己要說的話了，偉大的五四運動，就是我們第一次的嘹亮的呼號，靑年人斷然地堅持：「要求革新！要求做澈底的革新！」</p>
<p>在第一個光榮的靑運史實裏，上海靑少年是離不開的，她有過光耀榮譽的日子，她是中國靑年跳動的心臟，正像上海在全國所佔的地位一樣。</p>
<p>無庸諱言的，今日的上海靑年，是不夠盡了他歷史上應盡的義務。一部大學生拋却了寶貴的時光，瘋狂無度地在幹他的時髦的玩意兒；一部職業靑年們往往被瘋狂的投機囤積的變態心理，迷惑了自己本性，一部年靑的姑娘們在醉心競尙她們時裝……自然這僅是一部份自甘墮落的人，那行將成為時代渣滓的廢料，是不値得人們去憐惜的，靑年們！我們能怎樣去解釋呢？歷史會給我們輕輕的寬宥過去嗎？</p>
<p>但是，時光決不會等　　們，和寬宥我們的，很快地我們又踏進了驚心動魄的五月底日子了！在這血的恩仇的季節裏有着我們親切的自己的日子哩！——靑春的，跳躍的，熱的，偉大的「五五」節日巳來了！</p>
<p>我們能夠以怎麼樣的成就的來蹟來接近她呢？我們所感覺到的是自傲呢還是自愧呢？</p>
<p>靑年節是偉大的，但祇有在廣大優秀靑年愛戴擁護之下，才能發揮妙的偉大；靑年是珍貴的，但應該在靑年的節日裏，能檢明自己的力量和敢揚露自己的缺憾，才算得上珍貴，我們應該記取她有機的擊連，來作深深反省。</p>
<p>靑少年們！請坦白地在這「五五」的節日中，算一算自己的淸脹罷！</p>
<h3>二年來上海靑少年運動的溯和展望</h3>
<p>— 蕭逸</p>
<p>三三年三月間，南市賭窟，突然被一羣有血氣的靑年學生打坍了。上海人在嘡目咋舌，鼓掌稱快之餘，才熟悉了這一羣有肝膽的男兒，那就是上海靑少年第一次以實際的活動和全滬人士相見。</p>
<p>其實正式在廣大靑年羣中發生了有系統的組織力量，是始於三十三年度的舊八區分團部的成立，當時編就有校內外靑少年二萬餘人，受過訓練的幹部，有一百九十八名，那時工作很順利地進展着，所以能夠得到這樣高茺的成就，是因為有一個最好的條件存在，就是靑少年團和保甲當局，取得了緊密的連繫。</p>
<p>在三址三年的整個一年中，主要工作是培植舊八區各地域（以保甲區域來分）地方幹部，所以工作的觸鬚，還沒有深入到各個產業部門學校部門的廣泛靑年層和學生層中去，但初級幹部的訓練是成功的了。實由好景不常，隨着一八兩區行政機構的合併，「靑」「保」原有的至誠合作，却為着種種困難和波折，而宣吿勞燕分飛各自東西了。</p>
<p>三三年下半年以來，在上旣無辦公經費，在下又乏工作人員，邀着靑年人天眞的赤子之心，排解一切障礙和困難，歷盡艱苦，終於撑起了第一區團部的新的　型，至是年年底止，共有團員二百餘人，但大部均係舊八區幹部訓練班遺留下來的老同志，為了意氣相投，肝胆相照上才結　在一起工作的。</p>
<p>三四年二月，團址開始從方浜路遷入跑馬德，地點一適中，工作使有了新氣象，於是舊第一區及滬西方面亦絡續有新團員參加，至今巳有團員近四百人，指揮以下的專任工作人員十餘人。</p>
<p>至此，區團部的新的　型是庶幾大備了。</p>
<p>在這一時期中，主要的工作有二點：</p>
<p>第一是全力整頓內部機構，肅飭風紀，—（當時查有一二不肖份子，乘着團部新舊交替，靑黃不接之際，頂冒區團部名義，在舊八區某些酒館，茶室招搖撞騙，侗嚇滋擾，但查案後即開除懲辦，這種現象很快被肅淸了。以後各界如有發見，請通知本團部定予嚴懲。）這一點大體上是成功的，迄今指揮以下置有總務，訓導，敎練，組織，莫不經過澈底調動力求革新的；同時二百餘靑年同志亦均經過個別懇談，設法統一他們的政治理念和工作目的，極力避免拉夫式濫竽充數，以達到自覺自發參加工作的優秀程度。</p>
<p>第二是强化服務，擴大宣傳，上海任何一個巨大集會和　會與第　區團部是分不開的，其犖犖大者如國父誕辰植樹節大會，還都紀念大會，統一統國民衆大會……無不由本區團部擔任大會全部緝察工作，（同時本區團部有近半數同志參加中靑模範團第四聯隊第四大隊，是故第四聯有工作出動亦即區團部某些幹部同志出動）特別是還都紀念日到各戲院茶室之演講大會，尤得社會人士稱道，例如當在美琪大光明戲院及大東新都等茶室，我演講同志講畢離開後，一二分鑛內，猶歡呼雷動，掌聲不絕，證明觀衆是被感動了，亦多少可見工作是收到了一部份的效果。</p>
<p>最近鑒于大東亞戰爭日趨苛烈，上海巳接近了砲火的邊緣，舉凡地方治安，戰時防空；人口和產業疏散；失學和失業救濟；在在均需地方長官社會先進倡導於前；而廣大靑年力行于後，不過沒有組織的靑年是起不了作用的，區團部深鑒于斯，遂選擇高中以上校內外優秀靑年二百名（以後如得各產業公會合作尙可擴充之）組織服務大隊，以備市府當局和社會各界有重要工作時出而服務，可是在工產飛漲的情况下，一個淸苦的民運機關，如不得到社會上各產業部門的資助，是無論如何辦不了的，適巧本區團部為了慶祝五五靑年節擴大宣傳效果，由附設之一靑話劇社公演「黨人魂」于大光明，以伸慶祝後，並擬在五月十一，十二，十四，十五，四天中假座皇后大戲院義演四塲以備取受各界對于組織服務大隊經費上的資助。</p>
<p>以上是本區團部組織狀况和一般工作的情形。</p>
<p>顯然地，上海靑運是在一種極畸形和極凌亂的進程下行進的，組織的名目和系統，眞是花樣繁多，除中國靑少年團上海市團部各屬校區團部外尙有保甲處組織的防空團和自警團等（聞最近擬將這些類似的組織一併歸併在模範自警團內）這一組織規模最大，廣被全滬，此外尙有中日靑年同志會，中國靑年建設隊等，其含議較單一的如大學生防犯硏究會，大學生學術硏究會等，結果弄得四分五裂，各走各的道路，因此力　一分散，也就祇能做些虛華空洞的形式工作，按在實際，那一個團體是談得上有組織，有力量的呢？</p>
<p>其次　市府秉政諸公及社會諸先進能多多聽取靑年的呼聲，關懷靑年的生活，和相信靑年的力量，放胆的給他們工作做，同時要監督他們認眞去做，能在和他們職業學業不發生衝突的條件下，靑年是誰都願意戳力地為社會去服務的。</p>
<p>本月三月，新運分會改組無竣，由英明幹練經騐宏富的顧森千先生担任新運分會秘書長，同時兼任市團部事務副司令，在市區團部歡迎顧副司令的聯歡席上，顧副司令很懇切的向我們致訓詞，一再申說上海的靑少運動，短期內必有燦爛的前途；一切的困難問題，必有妥善的解決，希望同志們不要畏難而退，應該在不懼困難的意志下幹下去……</p>
<p>是的，我們定將秉承着絕對信念的意志，不怕困難地幹下去在一定的短時期內，而獲得的成果</p>
<h3>工作報道</h3>
<p>第一區團部最近擬組織一服務大隊，歡迎具有高中以上程度的靑年參加，各同業公會及大中學校，能具文保送的話，則尤感歡迎，團址在江陰路一〇一號。</p>
<p>第一區團部滬西辦事處，定於四月三十日起開始首屆幹部集中訓練，報名參加者非常踴躍，聞已選拔六十餘名着手訓練矣。</p>
<p>參加本年度全國靑少年團第三次首都總檢閱，上海隊代表十人，於五月二日上午四時半集合於第一區團部，共同出發，搭八時快車赴京。</p>
<p>一靑劇社即將公演「黨人魂」於皇后，定期是本月十一日起，十五日止，並在五月四日彩排於皇后大戲院，五五節獻演於大光明，藉伸慶祝，聞該劇團今後將續排碧花血和雲南起義，所需男女演員極多，愛好戲劇男女靑少年，均可報名參加。</p>
<h3>上海靑年的前途</h3>
<p>— 陳平</p>
<p>活躍年靑的偉大的「五五」靑年節，在大東亞戰爭緊迫的時候來到了！紀念今日這一歷史性廣泛的靑年節日，實含有很重要的意義存在。回憶去年大東亞靑少年指導者座談會席上盟邦日本代表香坂昌康說：「日本靑少年團運動的最高理念，乃連繫日本靑少年之力拭，期對國家有所貢獻」。在這最高目標下，日本靑少年運動在增進的工作上已表現了嶄新的英偉姿態，其他盟邦各地以及歐美各國的靑年運動，在今日戰爭風雲廣佈中都有英勇的功績表現。這證明靑年羣衆的力量是偉大而不可輕視的，是國家民族的命脈，是建設新的創造新的原素。</p>
<p>上海靑年運動在中國靑年運動歷史上佔有過光榮的一頁！在國家存亡危急之秋，他們把自己的力量與血肉貢獻了！在腐舊社會血液的死亡裏，他們把自己新鮮的血液勇敢的射進去！這一切表白了靑年們的特點是純潔熱情，是現實社會緻銳的感覺者，是現實社會的原動力！</p>
<p>但是今日上海靑年運動不但在低沉的階段裏更形成了嚴重的危機，由於上海社會畸形的特殊發展造成廣大靑年羣衆對現狀的不滿，對現狀的苦悶。這種現象加深的繼續發展，把過去上海靑年運動蓬勃的高潮推到了苦悶沉淵的潮流中去，推到了消沉糜爛的污水溝裏去。今天上海靑年最嚴重的苦悶病是對本身的天望，和忍受不下環境的打擊。學校靑年一面在書本上拚命用功，一而心靈上痛苦的感受注定的失學命運巳在判刑。職業靑年從朝至夜辛勤工作，所得結果顧不到自己的家　不飽自己的肚子，在一片裁員聲中又加上對自己可憐的飯碗頭的担心。而拚棄在社會大門外廣大的靑年是終日徘徊閒蕩。目前雖有大部份靑年從外形上觀察是自由正常，在實持上却存在很大缺陷。他們在股票市塲上奔波徘徊，在交易買賣上熱忱打聽，在各色遊嬉集會上興高采烈，這些現象却是指示出一般靑年旋轉在倒退的逆流裏，在生活自私的爭利裏在變態的苦悶的發洩裏。「失學」「失業」「思想」「生活」這些苦悶病嚴重的在一般靑年生活的角落裏生長着。這基本的根源是戰爭改變鄧上海社會的一切面目，同時上海社會本身經濟的複雜發展影響很多羣衆生活的不安。然而我們不能讓這種消沉，自私，腐爛的情形繼續存在着，目前旣面臨大東亞決戰的時期，動員一切參戰國力量是迫不及待，何况靑年羣衆是悜衛國家保障社會的最廣大的力量呢？尤其今後上海環境時能受空襲的危險，動員上海部份力量保障地方的秩序社會的安寗以及改輕防空危機的蔓延，隨時協助增加生產與疏散人口工作，這些都是今後上海民衆的急務，更是上海靑年應負荷的實際任務。</p>
<p>我們深信在這歷史緊急的時期中，上海靑年兄弟們，一定會勇敢的開拓自己燦爛的光榮前途，一定不會辜負社會國家所賦予的重任。而且相信我們的國家及社會各界人士會加緊對我們的領導與帮助。因此使我們加强以下的工作信心和目標。</p>
<p>際此大東亞戰爭緊迫的時期裏，上海危機加重，所以通力保障地方的治安，社會的安寗工作，及協助政府的增產工作是靑少年工作重要的一環。</p>
<p>動員全國力量，服務戰爭，是整個性的，靑少年應首先英勇的參加，所以加緊自己體魄的嚴格緞練，軍事拔能的訓練。是靑少年最現實的一個課程。</p>
<p>協助一切的社會工作，例如防空避難受傷救護消防準備以及疏散人口工作，農村的增產，社會事業的調查推動等工作，都是當今的急務，也是我們靑少年實際的工作，我們希望在有關當局領導下，廣大展開這些工作。</p>
<p>今後有計劃推動生活福利事業的進展，提倡多方面正當娛樂的活動，來充實靑少年蓬勃的精神，整合靑少年熱烈的力量，期望上海靑年們在這樣的目標下結合起來。</p>
<p>上海靑年們！面臨着今天活躍年靑的偉大的「五五」靑年節，讓我們牽緊手，加强我們的信心，拓展未來光明的前途吧，「我們必須在老的中國軀體中，注射新的靑年的血液」來捍衛國家的生存！保障會的健康！</p>
<p>體育</p>
<h3>季末風光談足球</h3>
<p>足球季節早成尾聲，故遲來球事殊見　珊。但以滬球迷對足球與趣特濃，以故當局有再接再厲之心。近來最引人囑目足球賽，即為日前（三日）靑年盃足球大賽。正在進行而受人關心者，則白馬與僑聯之賽，與夫足球邀請聯賽二者。茲先評靑年盃之役，及對後二者，加以申述。</p>
<h3>靑年盃橋聯戰勝聯誼</h3>
<p>靑年盃足球寒，僑聯與聯誼被邀作戰。際茲精彩足球賽稀少之時，球迷羣相往觀，故情况頗不寂寞。比賽結果，橋聯終以近况之佳，二對〇擊退聯誼，報復在足球聯賽中一箭中仇。</p>
<p>觀此次兩隊演出，俱鮮理想成績。蓋聯誼因調動過多，（大有藍球換人風味）有使人不集中之觀感。且隊員之因一再變動，亦呈格格不入，是何能有上佳表演。再就聯誼各個分析，皆有長力不逮之象，故其敗也宜矣。而兩大將吳祺祥宋靈聖之不出塲為致命傷。緣吳乃被黜關係，宋則臨時因事而誤，誠屬不幸。否則當有較佳演出。</p>
<p>橋聯雖以二對〇勝，但事實上，亦無往昔之作。其理山大致為自信為力過强，以為勝利可算，乃不免稍露驕態。再次，亦為嘗試新陣失敗，最近僑聯之陣容，頗見固定。但該隊此次作變動，以冀有新姿態出現。倉卒間之事，自難望效果。果爾，新陣之試，彼此均有生疏。及至恢復原狀後，始略見起色耳。</p>
<p>綜論，僑聯本屆有「氣」方面之偵利，與上屆東華有相似之點，可見足球賽與「氣」，大有關係。</p>
<h3>白馬盃改為福利賽</h3>
<p>前期本刋所述之白馬盃，呈請足聯會，當局巳經議決改為福利賽。其一切比賽均歸足聯會負責辦理，而開支將由福華烟草公司担任。此次福利目的，大致為捐助外籍保甲經費及敎育會兩種。</p>
<p>查福利賽本屆巳舉行七次，每次邀請强旅對壘，吸引力殊大，收穫自佳。乃對各方福利事業之帮助匪淺，各受惠機關，罵此均表示無限謝意，而出塲比賽之球員，亦由此中得到不少慰籍也。</p>
<p>迺者，白馬隊以東華為基本，復借用聯誼之宋靈聖李義臣等而組成，實力强勁，不可言喻。相約僑聯作戰，當具挑戰之意，亦應為我球迷所殷望之戰。蓋義將球藝確有進展與成功，則以白馬之將士而與之比賽，戰程緊張，球藝發揮，皆可在意米之中。大有人謂，白馬與僑聯相逢，將為本屆足球最精彩之一幕。</p>
<p>聞白馬隊日來練習不輟，主幹程伯菴，管理徐志豪，尤見興奮，時與各健兒商討硏究，俾使屆時一顯成風也。據悉此項大賽，巳決於下週內舉行，好戲在即，球迷欣賞有日，眼福誠非淺鮮。</p>
<h3>邀請足球賽正在進行中</h3>
<p>於足聯會主持之各項比賽完畢後，決舉辦邀請足球賽，將由三省體育會出面主辦。足聯會方面，本擬自辦，或以人事心力有限，在季尾例須休息一時，故委託三省體育會辦理。原定邀請中西六强，茲據悉三省當局表示，為塲為時間，以及務求　湊起見，內定祇邀請海上最四大强隊作循環賽。所謂四强者，仍將中西各半。華隊當為東華聯誼。西隊則必為僑聯與葡商。唯屆時各隊隊員之是否有變遷，目下難能斷定也，（梅）</p>
<h3>平津藍球概况</h3>
<p>華聯藥廠藍球隊健將張顯崙·全長春兩們，於月前隨該隊北國名手范慶公赴平津觀光，極受北地藍球界之歡迎，堅邀臨時組成「滬聯」隊，以稍慰該地人士之熱望，可見北地球迷對滬上藍球之注意。茲者張全巳於日前返滬，筆者曾與相晤，談及北地藍球簡情，容略介紹於次：</p>
<h3>藍球興趣普遍</h3>
<p>平津兩地索譽為我國藍球之搖籃，該地對藍球興趣，迄今依然倍於其他各項運動及球類比賽。各小學及中學·大學，凡有球塲者，必有多量藍球設備，而各學校當局亦竭力提倡·故藍球可稱為北地最普遍之運動。</p>
<h3>人才天津為多</h3>
<p>北京方面，最足稱雄者厥唯前曾一度片滬之北星隊。而天津則有勇津·津　·泰東三隊，實力均在水凖以上，尤以泰東隊不啻為天津市之代表隊。如劉學琦·王鴻斌·傳金聲等名將，均在該地。查北星與天津各隊成績不相上下，故兩地水凖在平行中，而人材則以天津為多。</p>
<h3>球塲較大而滑</h3>
<p>北地球塲能容納多量觀衆者，厥為室外沙泥地。而大多數重要比賽，例皆於室外舉行，其面積較滬上中靑球塲稍大。在滬上習於球房作戰，益覺其遼闊無邊。地係少泥，不慣者頗覺滑而不易控制。速率開足後，擬制止住，極易跌扑。如在最劇烈緊張時，乃有三本鐵公鷄之風味。</p>
<h3>觀衆欣賞程度</h3>
<p>觀衆觀球時之喝彩聲甚於滬上，且亦具有舞臺捧角之色彩同。而其欣賞點，則趨重於表演性之爽脆鏡頭，如以緩攻政策之方法進襲者，則未必能博得彩聲也。此或為北地人士之天性使然歟？</p>
<h3>急望扈北上</h3>
<p>據此次僅張全等二三人北去，巳受該地人士之歡迎。當張等返滬臨別時，該地體育界均殷殷託張等轉管滬上　球界，急望有一純粹之南方球隊員，能赴平津比賽，　資切磋，而慰沽上球迷悠久之渴望。蓋事實上，滬上藍球隊迄未有北征之舉，確可引為遺憾者，不訊滬上各球隊能否實踐乎？（潔）</p>
<h3>藍球學理述要（十八）</h3>
<p>— 梁兆安</p>
<h3>（五）現代進攻法</h3>
<p>現代藍球新戰術，種類繁多，而又日新月異，非本籍所能盡述。大概而論，在規則未取消中圈跳球，及即制議球後，十秒鐘內，必須攻過中綫前。藍球戰法，約可歸納為二種。　快攻與五人聯攻法，　延緩進攻法。前者為最盛行而極受人歡迎之戰法，後者為規則改變後所限制，漸被淘汰。</p>
<p>不過今之快攻與五人聯攻法，經近年之發展，與前頗有分別之處，其名稱亦有多種，在快攻方面，有所謂「火球」戰術，混戰，及猛激戰法等。在五人聯攻方面，則有陣地戰，緩攻，樞紐進攻法等。此等戰法，皆為破五人聯防之戰術。厥後因「人釘人」防守法，為今人所喜用。故又有所謂阻擋進攻法，用以擊破之。又自中圈跳球取消以後，（規則上自一九三八年起，中圈跳球，只限於下半摥開始比賽，及技術犯規時用。）又有名為無中圈跳球戰術。即在投中藍後，由端綫外擲球入塲，重行開始比賽之一種新戰法也。由此觀之，可見現代藍球進攻法，實遠較防守法為複雜也。茲為便於明瞭起見，特將各種進攻法之大意分述如下：</p>
<h3>（甲）快攻法</h3>
<p>快攻法，雖有猛擊，混戰，火球戰，雙V形速戰，種種不同陣綫之戰法，然其主要目的，在速戰二字。所謂速戰者，乃在乘人不備，出其不意，突然猛擊之謂也。</p>
<p>快攻之法，在固定戰略，如雙V形速戰法者外。槪而方之，即在護球後，乘對諒備，或不及退守之時，開始進攻。用直綫遠傳球法，迅速傳與藍下之同伴投入，俗所謂「偷冷飯」。或用單槍匹馬，一人拍球猛衝向前投藍。或用二人對一人，三人對二人，及四人對三人夾攻對方，使之防不勝防，守不勝守，尤以二人對一人之法，最為有效。</p>
<h3>排球季節將開始介紹男女二傑</h3>
<p>排球聯賽巳由委員會的積極進行，目下祇待塲地接洽妥當，便可見健兒馳騁球塲。現在記者不妨乘未展幕前，介紹男女二位特出人材，聊作前奏曲。</p>
<p>— 汪德元</p>
<p>排球健將能稱雄於時的，大都為粤產，這是因為粤地排球運動是有歷史性的關係。而我南方排球員可以玩玩的，當然不少，而要有特殊成績者，實不多觀。唯有這位汪德元君的排球技術，有第一流的技術。而在目下滬上人材凋零聲中，汪德元可稱是鶴立鷄羣的一位。現在他是白隊排球的隊柱，進攻獲分的唯一人物。他的特點是擊殺兇猛，當者難能還手。他的救球，關門，以及開球，俱有獨到的地方。德元除排球外，其他運動，多不擅長，這眞的也許他是天賦的排球異材。</p>
<p>— 陳梅貞</p>
<p>陳小姐是三省女子排球隊的隊長，因為她身材高大，所以位居頭排中央，有左扣右殺隨心所欲的技能。記得在六七年前，陳小姐代表旋路排球隊初度出馬，她的球藝，震驚了一般老將。而記者那時也覺得她該是排球的奇材。直到目下為止，陳小姐還能保持女將中有獲分把握的扣殺的一記，對於關門及托球技術，尙無硏究。這是她始終為一隊中太寄重於獲分的原因。所以為陳小姐應更進一層而求成功，則對於各方面多要加以硏究練習。</p>
<p>陳小姐除排球外，對其他運動，亦少成績。雖然藍球也是三少隊隊員之一，但完全是濫宇充數而巳。（瘦人）</p>

<h3>Fierce Battles Erupt at the West Coast Main Hall of Okinawa Island, Japanese Special Attack Squads Sink Four Enemy Warships</h3>
<p>Southwest Base, 4th (Central News Agency) - The battle situation on Okinawa Island on the 2nd is as follows: A considerably powerful enemy force attacked the east coast, but by 11:00 AM that morning, it was finally repelled by the brave Japanese army. In the Kochi-Maeda area, the enemy attacked with tanks, but was repeatedly and fiercely attacked by the Japanese army. As for the enemy forces on the west coast, they continued to bombard, and after noon, their artillery fire became even more intense, but the Japanese army secured its positions, which were unbreakable. On the 3rd, the enemy repeatedly attacked Kochi, but was repelled by the Japanese army each time. In its forward and intermediate positions, there were still powerful enemy forces with tanks repeatedly attacking, but the Japanese army secured its positions, causing heavy losses to the enemy. On this day, a part of the enemy forces on the west coast also attacked, and at around 2:00 PM in the afternoon, it mobilized another team to assist. The Japanese army bravely met the enemy and launched a fierce attack, and fierce battles are now underway.</p>
<p>Southwest Base, 4th (Central News Agency) - Japanese special attack squads and air units continue to attack enemy ships around Okinawa Island day and night. From the land base, the situation of friendly aircraft bravely attacking can be seen, making the officers and soldiers on the ground even more high-spirited. At dusk on the 3rd, a Japanese single attack broke through an enemy cruiser and sank its destroyer and minesweeper each, and also sank its cruiser on the sea off the north airfield. In addition, on the night of the 3rd, the Japanese Air Force fiercely attacked the two airfields in northern and central Okinawa Island, and more than a dozen fires broke out, lasting for a long time. In addition, on the 3rd, about 350 enemy aircraft, including several B29 types, bombed the entire line of the Ryukyu Islands.</p>
<p>Japanese Military and Civilians Donate Money to Build Aircraft</p>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - The decisive battle in Ryukyu is a major key to determining the survival of the Greater East Asia. Because the Japanese army, navy, and air force have displayed special attack magic, causing the enemy American army to suffer major setbacks and be extremely anxious, and the Japanese compatriots in Ryukyu, seeing the "divine" suicidal spirit, all shouted, "The special attack aircraft should continue to work hard and must not be interrupted." Because of their keen patriotism, recently all the officials of the Ryukyu Prefectural Government and all the staff of the secondary schools and national schools in the prefecture have donated all of their April salaries to the Ministry of the Army as funds for building aircraft. In addition, all the officers and soldiers of the entire Ryukyu force have also donated all their April salaries to the Ministry of the Army for the purpose of consolidating national defense.</p>
<p>American War Prospects Difficult</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 4th (Central News Agency) - A report from the United Press on the 30th described the scale and power of the Japanese special attack squads as follows: "Japanese special attack squads often form large teams to attack. For example, they continued to attack on the afternoon of the 28th. Although the American ships tried desperately to defend and fired fiercely, there was nothing they could do." According to a broadcast from Chongqing on the 30th, the Military Affairs Commission announced that the Japanese special attack aircraft teams in Ryukyu were making it impossible for the American army to do anything, and that such teams were likely to be inexhaustible. Therefore, the United States is facing very difficult prospects for the war against Japan, and the Chongqing army on the mainland plans to mobilize reinforcements to fight as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Guam Base, the British battleship "George V" and the aircraft carrier "Illustrious" participated in the Pacific War, which has been announced by the British and American naval authorities.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Where Are Chinese Youths Going?</h3>
<p>No one can deny that the era we are in is an unprecedentedly significant era in human history. After this war, all corrupt elements and those who live in drunken stupor without striving for self-improvement will be eliminated by the torrent of the times; only those who are self-reliant and strive to improve and move forward will have days of exhaling and raising their eyebrows after experiencing hardships. However, looking back at our country, looking back at the current situation of the youth on whom our national destiny rests, we cannot help but feel disheartened!</p>
<p>Based on recent observations of the actual situation, there are three tendencies among youth in the peaceful areas: The first is to completely disregard reality, disregard the future of the world and the nation, and only know how to rely on the wealth and power of their parents and ancestors, living a life of drunken stupor, just as the "Enlightenment Scripture" says, "Although their bodies are present, their hearts are dead." The second is to only passively be dissatisfied with reality, expressing dissatisfaction, pessimism, and disappointment in everything, but without the ambition and ability to improve the status quo. They always stay out of things. The third attitude is more positive, but under the pressure of life, they have to scramble for a way to survive, so they run single errands, set up stalls, speculate, and earn extra money; their desire to make a living is not without sympathy, but as a result, they cannot take care of the country and society, and they are willing to forget righteousness in order to pursue profit; where great righteousness lies, they avoid it because it is contrary to their private interests. Of course, in addition to these three types of people, we can occasionally see struggling and promising youth, but they are rare and account for a very small number.</p>
<p>Secondly, what is even more heartbreaking is that recently many college students do not know how to study and prepare to be cadres for building a new China in the future, and there are even behaviors of self-degradation, such as flocking to group dances, etc. This newspaper has repeatedly received letters from readers, lamenting the absurd behaviors of most college students in Shanghai recently, which are emerging one after another. According to reports, the group dances of college students in this city started in the New Year of the current lunar calendar. Students from various universities held joint dance parties at the Lido Ballroom. The system of lottery tickets was imitated, and several female students sold happiness tickets, drawing prizes based on numbers, but the result was a huge income, with a considerable surplus in addition to the scheduled prizes. Since then, most college students have been skipping classes and abandoning their studies, and flocking to the so-called "party" of group dancing. At the same time, the declining dance industry in this city has also taken this as a new profit, and has been catering to the psychology of decadent youth, falsely calling it "college student dance party" and engaging in dirty money-making activities. If such actions to seduce young people are allowed, youth with weak will are very likely to become depraved, which is really a major crisis for society and the country!</p>
<p>At this time of turbulent situation, for the sake of the future of society and the country, we believe that concern for and guidance of youth is one of the most important tasks at present. The youth of our ally, Japan, have either joined the army and are fighting on the front lines to defend their country, or are participating in increased production work in the rear; they, regardless of gender, are unanimously working seriously. Most of the youth of both genders in the inland areas are also studying and working seriously. If the youth in the peaceful areas continue to live in drunken stupor and do not strive for self-improvement, the future of the country is really unimaginable! As for the general dissatisfaction of youth with the status quo, from another point of view, it is undoubtedly a gratifying phenomenon, but it is not enough to simply be dissatisfied with the status quo. At the same time, we must think about how to actively assist in improving the status quo, so that we can be worthy of being ambitious youth. Therefore, those in school must study, exercise their bodies, and those at work must work hard in their respective positions. Passive emotions of pessimism and despair are not attitudes that healthy youth should have!</p>
<p>However, the formation of the phenomenon of youth's depression and depravity is indeed attributable to the failure of social leaders to set an example and correct it in time. The words and deeds of social leaders can influence youth, so they must be models for youth; they should step forward for the benefit of the country, the nation, social welfare, not shrinking, not evading, not taking shortcuts for personal gain, so that the social atmosphere gradually changes. Premier Suzuki of our ally, at the advanced age of seventy, stepped forward in the autumn of national crisis, his youthful spirit is worthy of emulation by the people of the country. Today is Youth Day, may the youth rise up and strive for self-improvement, and everyone can display the vigor of youth, so that we can reform politics, transform the country, and realize the mission entrusted by the times!</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Fights Valiantly on Tarakan Island, Intense Bombardment on the Linkas Coast</h3>
<p>A Certain Base, 4th (Central News Agency) - The enemy forces that landed on Tarakan Island mobilized powerful troops on the 3rd, assisted by tanks, to attack the Japanese defense line. The Japanese defense team lured the enemy forces to the front of the position and suddenly launched a fierce attack. The enemy forces could not hold on and fled to the coastal area, with about forty dead and wounded. The Japanese artillery team also responded and opened fire together, immediately sinking three small enemy ships.</p>
<p>Southwest Pacific Base, 4th (Central News Agency) - There were no major changes in the battle situation on Tarakan Island on the 3rd. The enemy forces were trying to strengthen their tank soldiers with landing craft, preparing to attack, but did not launch a real battle. The enemy ships approaching the Linkas coast were firing with naval guns, and the situation was very intense. The Japanese army opened fire from the land and immediately sank three minesweepers and destroyed another one. The rest disappeared, and it can be determined that they were attempting to land on the east coast. The Japanese army is now closely guarding the movements of the enemy forces. On the evening of the 2nd, the Japanese army stepped forward and entered the enemy's formation, disrupting its camp, killing and wounding many personnel, and destroying the enemy's offensive.</p>
<p>Landing on Tarakan Island Aims to Seize Oil</p>
<p>Southwest Pacific Base, 4th (Central News Agency) - The enemy's ambition to seize the oil resources of Borneo is becoming more and more obvious after they landed on Tarakan Island. At a time when the decisive battle in Ryukyu is fierce, the enemy actually dispatched large ships and soldiers and materials to forcibly land on Tarakan. There are several reasons for this: Even though the enemy forces have broken into the Japanese inner defense line, the B29-type bombers of the Mariana base have not been effective in bombing Japan proper, especially around Ryukyu Island, the losses of aircraft carriers and other ships can be described as the most tragic since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, the fuel used by ships and aircraft must not be sought from their own country, but must be sought from oil-producing areas adjacent to the war zone. The oil on Tarakan Island is of extremely good quality and can be used immediately. Not only can it hinder Japan's oil resources, but it can also increase the speed of operations in Shonan (i.e., Singapore). From this point of view, the enemy's ambitions cannot be ignored. However, the Japanese defense line is foolproof and fully prepared.</p>
<h3>British Mobile Unit Bombards Daio Island</h3>
<p>A Certain Base in the Indian Ocean, 4th (Central News Agency) - A British mobile unit approached Daio Island in the Andaman Islands from 10:00 AM on the 3rd for about half an hour and bombarded it.</p>

<h3>Yan'an Holds National Congress</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) - The Chinese Communist Party held its Seventh National Congress in Yan'an in late April, deciding to unite all the Chinese people to save the crisis caused by the erroneous policies of the Chongqing Kuomintang government and build the so-called free and democratic unified new China. The chairman of this conference was Mao Zedong, Zhu De, Zhou Enlai and other 15 people, and there were 544 official representatives, 208 alternate representatives, a total of 700 people, representing 1.2 million members of the Chinese Communist Party. The agenda of the conference was divided into four items: Mao Zedong's political report, Zhu De's military report, Liu Shaoqi's report on amending the party constitution, and the election of the Central Committee. In particular, Mao Zedong's political report is extremely noteworthy. The full text is about 60,000 words, and its main points discuss the so-called "coalition government," vehemently denying the so-called National Congress forged by the Chongqing regime, and advocating that all parties and factions should unite to form a coalition government. In this regard, the Chinese Communist Party's active theoretical struggle against the Chongqing Kuomintang has become more superficial, which is a phenomenon worthy of attention. The Yan'an regime held its first National Congress in January 1921, and this event was held 17 years after the first congress.</p>

<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to a London message: Yesterday, British Prime Minister Churchill was absent from the House of Commons during the question period, which aroused various speculations among the members, who thought that he was going to the United States to consult with President Truman, or that he was flying to Germany to personally handle a certain important event.</p>
<p>Local Communications</p>
<h3>Casual Talk of Hefei</h3>
<p>— Xu Ming</p>
<p>Hefei is located in the central part of Anhui Province, between the Yangtze and Huai Rivers. To the north, it points to the Central Plains, and to the south, it connects with the capital. Since the Three Kingdoms period, whenever there were disturbances in the Jianghuai area, it has been a strategic location for military strategists. Moreover, it belongs to the rice-producing area of Anhui Province, so in years of favorable weather, its prosperity surpasses that of the Huainan region. I have been here for over a month, and what I have heard and seen is worth reporting to the people of Shanghai. Therefore, I specially record it for the readers.</p>
<p>The Land is Spiritually Endowed, Producing Outstanding People</p>
<p>Hefei is an ancient city, and also a place that "produces people." In the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, there is the chapter "Zhang Liao Startles Xiaoyao Ford." This Xiaoyao Ford is located within the city of Hefei, and there is also Cao Cao's military review platform, which is one of the famous historical sites. Legend has it that the famous selfless and impartial Judge Bao from history was a native of Hefei. The Bao Gong Ancestral Hall and Bao Family River outside the city are still available for later generations to commemorate. Li Hongzhang and Duan Qirui, who were influential figures in the late Qing Dynasty and early Republic of China, also had their ancestral homes here. As for high-ranking officials who received titles and favors from Qing Dynasty emperors, there are many tales as well. According to the people of Hefei, there are over two hundred division commanders of Hefei origin in the army, and the number of regimental and battalion commanders is countless. Wei Lihuang was also a native of Hefei. According to Feng Shui experts, Hefei is surrounded by mountains in the north and embraces Chaohu Lake in the south, and the soil is rich and fertile, so it is "spiritually endowed," and therefore produces many "outstanding people." Local people all pass down poetry and books within their families. The Spring Festival couplets on the doors of every household in the city, judging from the exquisite calligraphy, are enough to show that Hefei is a city of scholars.</p>
<p>Transportation and Market Conditions</p>
<p>Since the Huainan Railway was rerouted last year, this area, being within the dismantled railway zone, can no longer be directly reached by train. There are currently two transportation lines:</p>
<p>(1) The "Central China Transportation" trucks from Hefei to Shuijiahu. From Shuijiahu to Bengbu, there are trains for unloading and transfer, leading to the Southern Line.</p>
<p>(2) Small steamboats from Hefei through Chaoxian County to Yuxikou. From Yuxi, crossing the Yangtze River leads to Wuhu.</p>
<p>Comparing the two lines, the first line is safer. However, the fares are both expensive. Before the dismantling of the railway, the Hefei market had already shown little improvement. After the dismantling of the railway, it has declined even further. Although food prices are cheap, it is difficult to earn money. While other regions had bumper harvests last year, Hefei suffered from severe drought, resulting in an even greater impact. If transportation remains inconvenient in the future, there is no hope for improvement in market conditions. The price of rice is 56,000 per dan (approximately 50 kg), large dou (unit of measurement), flour is 400 per jin (approximately 500 g), and pork is 550 per jin. Three eggs cost 100 yuan.</p>
<p>Opium Tables</p>
<p>Local opium is sold publicly, and because the profits are high, few farmers do not grow it. Although the government has repeatedly issued orders, the words are earnest, but the listeners are indifferent, and little has been achieved. Moreover, it is related to local finances, making reform difficult. The main trading place for opium is outside the East Gate of the city. Square tables are used as markers, with opium placed on top for buying and selling, conducted openly. The equipment is simple and the procedures are convenient. Local people call it "opium tables," which can be compared with the "rat cages" of Bengbu. Because opium is produced, there are also many addicts, and it is worrying what the future holds if this continues.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Famine</p>
<p>In places that rely on agriculture, people depend on the weather. Hefei suffered from severe drought last year, and before the wheat harvest this year, people were living in famine. Most of the residents in the city are engaged in industry and commerce, landlords, and soldiers, so they can still cope with life. However, rural farmers have no harvest, and taxes are heavy. Unwilling to abandon the fields that have been cultivated for generations, they live in extreme poverty. After the busy farming season, most young and strong people go out to flee the famine. Those who remain at home, lacking money to buy rice, subsist on wheat paste, small garlic, sweet potato leaves, and wild vegetables. I have never seen farmers in the countryside eat rice. However, in order to cope with the pressure to pay rice and grass taxes, villagers have to borrow money to buy rice and grass to barely survive. Their plight is truly beyond words. As for the prevalence of opium, gambling, and usury in rural towns, it is no different from the rural areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang.</p>
<p>People's Burden</p>
<p>Taking a township with an area of 15 square li (approximately 7.5 km) and a population of over 10,000 as a unit, the people's monthly burden includes the following:</p>
<p>Food rice: 220 dan.</p>
<p>Burning grass: 600 dan.</p>
<p>Cash: 5,500,000.</p>
<p>Labor: 20,000 workdays. On average, each able-bodied man in each household works fifteen days a month without meals provided.</p>
<p>Other temporary building materials, such as earth bricks and wood, are requisitioned as needed without a fixed schedule. As for taxes, they are not yet included. In short, there are numerous organizations, and even the army is said to have three kinds in the Republic of China. The heavy burden on the people is imaginable.</p>
<p>Hefei has its glorious past, and it is an important town in Huainan, but due to frequent disturbances and transportation obstacles, it has gradually declined. How to revive it is the responsibility of the people of Hefei and the authorities. (Relocation to Support Education)</p>

Although defeated, the German nation has displayed heroic spirit and left behind traces of brave fighting in the annals of history. Let the enemy judge how they will evaluate us. Therefore, I hope you will not despair. He has issued the following orders: Immediately restore the German railways, fulfill your obligations and do your best to repair workshops and factories. German farmers who have endured hard battles must be aware of the great obligations they bear to the entire nation and do their best to increase production. Do your utmost to supply food, electricity, gas, and wood, regardless of whether the enemy allows us to advance the above tasks. We can only do our best to maintain the survival of the German people. Only the gods can regenerate our destiny. We must face the enemy with dignity and confidence and use a strong belief to open up our destiny for the future of the German nation."</p>

<h3>Soviet Union Accuses Britain and the United States of Violating Prisoner of War Agreement; U.S. State Department Issues Rebuttal Statement</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Stockholm, 4th — According to Moscow Radio, the Director of the Soviet Prisoner of War Exchange Committee issued a statement criticizing Britain and the United States for violating the Crimean Conference decision on the treatment and exchange of prisoners of war. The main points are as follows: Britain and the United States are now failing to implement the Yalta decision on the treatment and exchange of prisoners of war among the three countries, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. On the contrary, they are taking opposing actions. For example, there are currently eight hundred Soviet military officers and prisoners of war in the United States, but the United States has not notified the Soviet Union of the location of these prisoners. Furthermore, there are currently three prisoner of war camps in the United Kingdom that house Red Army prisoners.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 3rd — Regarding the Soviet government's accusation that Britain and the United States violated the prisoner of war exchange agreement, the U.S. State Department issued a statement on the 3rd, refuting as follows: The Soviet Union's accusations have no basis in fact. The reasons are as follows: Among the prisoners of war sent to the United States during the initial fighting in France, approximately 4,300 were identified as Soviet citizens and were quickly returned to their home country. As the fighting progressed, the U.S. military released Soviet citizens who had been captured or exploited by the German military. In the United States, there are 118 prisoners who appear to be Soviet citizens, but because they were wearing German uniforms and taking hostile actions against the U.S. military, they were treated as German prisoners of war.</p>

<h3>Strengthening Guild Organizations, Dredging Sources of Goods, Director Xu of the Economic Bureau Talks About the General Situation of Administration</h3>
<p>The 15th press conference hosted by the Propaganda Office of the Shanghai Special Municipality was held at 10:30 a.m. on the 4th in the city government conference room. Director Xu Jiang of the Municipal Economic Bureau was specially invited to attend and answer questions raised by various newspapers. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Suppressing Prices</p>
<p>(Question) Recently, the price of goods in Shanghai has been rising endlessly, which has greatly affected the livelihood and public security. The bureau has twice suppressed the price of goods, determining new price limits, but the actual number of businesses that comply with the price limits is still small. Does the bureau have any concrete measures to thoroughly suppress prices? (Answer) The bureau's handling of commodity registration and cracking down on hoarding is the basic work to suppress prices. Personnel are sent to secretly investigate stores that exceed the price limit and are punished accordingly, and letters are sent to the police bureau for assistance. As for concrete measures to thoroughly suppress prices, we are actively dredging the sources of goods.</p>
<p>(Question) Recently, due to the increase in prices of public utilities, the prices of various commodities have also risen crazily. What are the countermeasures? (Answer) The bureau is investigating the rise in prices of various commodities following the increase in prices of public utilities.</p>
<p>Reorganizing Guilds</p>
<p>(Question) Regarding strengthening the organizational structure of various industry guilds, what is the current progress of the guilds that should be reorganized or merged? (Answer) The work of reorganizing industry guilds can be completed recently. However, strengthening the organizational structure is complicated. A detailed announcement will be made after the entire plan is finalized.</p>
<p>Commodity Registration</p>
<p>(Question) After the registration of major commodities began on April 16th, it is said that many businesses are not enthusiastic about complying with the registration. If registration is not completed by the deadline, what measures are planned? (Answer) All methods and procedures for registering major commodities have been disclosed in the newspapers. The bureau has strictly urged various industry guilds to notify their members to register on schedule to avoid penalties for overdue registration.</p>
<p>Thoroughly Investigating Securities Exchanges</p>
<p>(Question) Recently, regarding the drastic changes in Shanghai's financial situation, the bureau director and the China Reserve Bank's Inspection Office and the Ministry of Finance's Securities Exchange Supervisor thoroughly investigated the account books of securities firms. Can you tell us about the process? (Answer) The content of the ordered investigation of securities exchanges is roughly divided into two key points: (A) Stopping convenient transactions, (B) Strictly prohibiting over-the-counter transactions.</p>
<p>(Question) What are your feelings about the soaring and plummeting of stocks and gold? (Answer) The soaring of stocks and gold is due to speculation by floating capital, but both soaring and plummeting are manageable. The government is closely watching to make the ups and downs rational.</p>
<p>Recent Administration</p>
<p>(Question) What is the recent administration of the Economic Bureau? Are there any new plans to improve the current chaotic economic situation? (Answer) The bureau has no new plans in terms of recent administration. We are currently: 1. Strengthening guilds, 2. Trying to dredge the sources of goods. If the above two items can be carried out smoothly, it will be beneficial to the current chaotic economic situation. Otherwise, it will be difficult to implement even if there are new plans.</p>
<p>Cooking Oil Prices</p>
<p>(Question) After the announcement of the selling price of cooking oil in the city, it was possible to buy it sporadically at first, but now all cooking oil retailers have no goods on the market, and the price of cooking oil on the black market has skyrocketed, causing hardship to the people. What appropriate measures does the Economic Bureau have to deal with this? (Answer) Cooking oil is subject to control. We are consulting with the Oil Control Association to adjust the methods.</p>
<p>How are the controlled materials handled after they are confiscated, and what is the total amount? (Answer) No cases of confiscation of controlled materials have occurred during my tenure.</p>
<h3>Various Control Associations Strengthen Purchasing Work; Purchased Materials are in Transit</h3>
<p>Various control associations under the Commerce Control Association have expanded the amount of funds for purchasing controlled materials this year in accordance with needs and increased agricultural production. It is understood that most of the funds that each control agency has borrowed from the Central Reserve Bank and the Shanghai Banking Syndicate have been used up for purchases. Recently, the prices of goods in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui and the two cities of Nanjing and Shanghai have varied greatly, and transportation in various places is not smooth. People from all walks of life believe that the purchasing work of various control associations will be affected. However, according to many sources, the price issue of agricultural products has been determined by various control associations long ago and will be carried out sequentially, which will not fundamentally affect the budget. Furthermore, transportation is actively promoted everywhere, and purchasing is strengthened everywhere. Materials such as cotton, rice, flour, and oil crops have been collected in warehouses and offices in various production areas, and either have been shipped to Shanghai in batches or are in transit.</p>

<p>Since the restoration of power allocation to textile factories in the city last month, production has gradually increased. Recently, the industry has decided to distribute gold to all shareholders using the gold received from the authorities for the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth. It is reported that Da Gong and Yuan Yuan factories have already started to implement this method. The methods are as follows: Da Gong issues 0.2 points of gold per ten shares and an additional cash dividend of 1,000 yuan. Yuan Yuan issues 0.05 points of gold per thousand shares and an additional cash dividend.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Business Directory Already Published; Subscribers Pick Up Books with Vouchers</h3>
<p>The "Shanghai Business Directory," compiled and printed by this newspaper, experienced several interruptions in printing due to repeated electricity restrictions. However, through various efforts, it has now been printed and bound into a thick volume. The book contains over 20,000 prominent industrial and commercial establishments in the city, along with various appendices and the most recent detailed Shanghai city maps. It is considered an essential reference tool for the business community. It has now been published, and previously subscribed users can pick up their books at the newspaper's circulation department, starting immediately, by presenting their order forms. Due to the doubled cost of paper and labor, after careful consideration, the price of the book has been revised to 8,000 yuan. The number of copies printed is limited, so those who wish to purchase should do so quickly.</p>
<h3>University Student Crime Prevention Committee Asks Students to Cease Tea Dances</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality University Student Crime Prevention Research Committee, noting that university students often hold "parties" with social tea dances in dance halls and other venues, where male and female students dance wildly, deems this highly inappropriate. It has been verified that the New Citizen Movement youth and students previously strongly advocated for the strict prohibition of opium, gambling, and dancing as part of the anti-three vices movement, even destroying gambling tables and dance halls. Holding social tea dances now is completely contrary to the principles of the New Citizen Movement and hinders academic pursuits. Therefore, it has been approved by the Municipal Education Bureau and the Municipal Police Bureau's Crime Prevention Section to prohibit these activities. The authorities have accepted this proposal and will implement a ban to rectify the academic atmosphere.</p>

<h3>Hope Public Utilities Will Not Raise Prices Again in the Future</h3>
<p>Since May 1st, the prices of trams, telegrams, postage, etc., have been re-adjusted, with considerable increases. Public utilities are intended to serve society and are fundamentally different from other profit-seeking entities. This price adjustment is indeed a necessary measure, but the impact on people's livelihoods is undeniable. It is hoped that after this price adjustment, prices will not be raised again within a possible range. It is also hoped that the relevant authorities will consider the burden on ordinary people when reviewing, which would be fortunate. (Liu Zhizhi)</p>

<h3>Going to Okinawa with a Smile</h3>
<p>— Special Attack Squads are "Living Bombs" — Roundtable Discussion with Three Special Correspondents from Land and Naval Aviation Bases</p>
<p>Watanabe: I've been to Army Base A, the front line in southern Kyushu. Because it is nearest Okinawa Island, special attack aircraft going there are just as if at the battlefield. The enemy's small aircraft, or short-range aircraft from Iwo Jima, often strike unexpectedly, and the situation is very tense. The tense and excited staff and command post personnel have not slept peacefully once since the American enemy landed on Okinawa Island, often dozing off at their desks. As a result, they have completely lost their appetite, eating only a bite or two of food before losing interest. As soon as they hear that a special attack plane has arrived, even the special attack members who are eating immediately put down their chopsticks and want to go to war. Whether special attack members or guards, everyone at the base is united, prepared to ram their bodies into enemy aircraft carriers. This base has become a huge cannon, continuously firing special attack "living bombs" at Okinawa every day.</p>
<p>Okayudera: Honestly, the fighting spirit at the base is truly earth-shattering. People who are not at the base cannot imagine the spirit there. Anyone who has seen the power of the base will naturally have a strong desire to increase aircraft production. Everyone believes that as long as there are planes, we will win.</p>
<p>Mimuro: In short, the main battlefield of the Pacific decisive battle has shifted to Okinawa. In terms of timing, it has entered a critical moment. "A single misstep leads to eternal regret" is an appropriate description of the situation here. Everyone feels this keenly. Therefore, the tension at the base is incredible. Rather than saying that people generally yearn for aircraft reinforcements, everyone is filled with a spirit of shared hatred against the enemy. Materials are continuously transported to Okinawa. Our base has been launching attacks almost every day since the first attack on April 6th. One day, special attack squads advancing to our base did not even have time to drink tea before attacking to kill the enemy. At the same time, due to weather conditions, they ran around the base all night. Seeing this situation, no one was not moved. From this, one can see the situation of the battle of Okinawa Island.</p>
<p>Courageous Spirit</p>
<p>Okayudera: The more attacks by the first, second, and third special attack squads, the more difficult it becomes. Now is the most difficult time. Because the enemy was initially caught off guard and stunned by the ramming of Japanese special attack aircraft. Naturally, this was because it was the first time the enemy's army and navy aviation units had encountered this special attack method. The enemy's defensive fire, which is trying to prevent special attack planes from ramming them, has become increasingly fierce. The enemy is equipping more and more escort fighters with highly sensitive radar detectors. They are afraid of night air raids and are releasing a large number of night fighters at all costs. The enemy, which is truly worthy of its reputation for abundant materials, now has excellent night fighters. When special attack teams are mentioned, some people may mistakenly believe that all they need to do is take a bomb or torpedo and ram it into an enemy ship, but the reality is not so simple. It must be understood that the more important the mission of the special attack squad, the greater the difficulty.</p>
<p>Also, some people in our Japanese air force believe that the enemy's American ships invading Okinawa Island number more than 1,400, but according to the results announced by the Japanese headquarters, only half have been eliminated, which has led to some feeling discouraged and disheartened. But the actual results are much greater than the published figures.</p>
<p>The results announced by the headquarters are only the maximum results acknowledged by the escorting comrades. In recent days, the results obtained by special attack planes without direct escort protection cannot be verified because all aircraft have rammed into their targets and have not returned, so there is no way to know. Some people must believe that the purpose of the direct escort aircraft accompanying the sortie is to judge the results so as to inform the people, but as far as special attack units are concerned, the results are not the main issue. They only know how to complete the ramming mission. The so-called direct protection cannot be judged by its name alone as simply being in charge of protection, but when necessary, it can only be ramming. Now there is no question of escort aircraft. When there are many aircraft, there are certainly escort aircraft, but now there is no need for such extravagance and waste to bring escort aircraft. The special attack aircraft only knows how to ram enemy ships. It is a bit uneconomical for one aircraft to ram one warship. Lieutenant S of a certain base said that one aircraft often destroyed a cruiser and a destroyer. Lieutenant S said with boiling killing intent:</p>
<p>"We cannot die unless we completely destroy enemy ships. Let's call this tactic the Special Attack Method!"</p>
<p>Mimuro: At the moment before the attack, the squad members stand in front of their aircraft, holding round rice balls in their hands and saying, "Let's eat them on the battlefield!" Another person does not laugh and says, "Let's eat them here! Because we can only arrive at the battlefield at noon, let's eat and then go:" The meal has neither wine nor dishes. There's no talk of a feast. They feel as if they are going on a picnic to the nearby seaside.</p>
<p>It is truly impossible to explain to those who are not there. They go to the battlefield and exchange their lives for results. Even an hour or two before ramming and sacrificing themselves, they are still calm and composed. A team leader handed his beloved knife to the maintenance chief, leaving a few words saying, "Now is when I use my life to ram the enemy, so this knife is not needed." He also said that writing a will or not writing a will is the same anyway. Finally, this soldier of the "no good" youth took off without leaving a single word.</p>
<p>Watanabe: Sometimes I ran to the squad members to inquire about their feelings before the attack. One very young pilot frankly replied in a low voice, "I don't think about anything." This can truly be said to regard death as a return. I felt very ashamed, why did I ask such a stupid question?</p>
<p>Air and Land United</p>
<p>Okayudera: In addition, at the base, the air and land forces can be said to be completely united, without any disagreements. The pilots who have harvested such brilliant results naturally need to share some of the credit with the maintenance personnel who continue to work tirelessly day and night. At the same time, Japan does not have enough aircraft, but it has been able to make the most of the current number of aircraft, which is naturally due to the merit of the land maintenance personnel. The maintenance personnel work hard and sweat profusely before sending off the special attack team on its sortie, which can only inspire admiration.</p>
<p>Because no one works when they sleep at night, they immediately jump up to work when they hear the order to service the aircraft. When enemy aircraft come, they drag the aircraft to a safe area, that is, drag it from the airport to a distant hiding place. Because the maintenance personnel are overworked day and night, their hands, faces, and entire bodies are covered in sweat, dirt, and skin mixed together, completely turning black.</p>
<p>Recently, because night attacks and dawn attacks have increased, there is no time to sleep, and the night maintenance work has especially increased. During enemy air raids at night, the working hours are further extended because no lights can be turned on. Maintenance materials are also not wasted because they are on the front line. If there is an order for a special attack unit to sortie tomorrow morning, the maintenance soldiers that night will definitely not be able to sleep. The drivers pity them and share their food with the maintenance personnel to temporarily fill them up for the night, but the maintenance personnel refuse, saying, "The people who are going on the expedition should eat this meal." The maintenance soldiers still endure hunger and work busily in the dark corners of the airport. The maintenance personnel are truly admirable.</p>
<p>Watanabe: The mission of the escort fighters, which specialize in protecting the brave special attack squads who selflessly ram enemy ships, is to protect the special attack squads safely to their target battlefield, day and night. The hard work and merit of the escorts should also not be ignored. They take off to greet them when the special attack planes arrive, and they stand guard when they attack. These tireless escort members have moustaches on their faces and bright lights in their eyes.</p>
<p>Value Aircraft</p>
<p>Okayudera: Old airmen who have worked for four years are still working at the base, which proves the strength of the Japanese Air Force. The enemy may have a large number of aircraft, but they do not have drivers, so they gather students to implement short-term training, and sometimes even conscript people from the county. Compared with us in Japan, the enemy is truly not good in terms of talent. But Japan has such excellent drivers who are the pride of the world, and it is not possible to make all of them special attack members at once. The fact is that many people feel sorry that they have not become special attack members and have to become ordinary pilots. The base commander and flight commander often painstakingly console these ordinary pilots, knowing my difficulties. I already knew you wanted to ram, you didn't have to say it. But today I can only send out 0 aircraft. If I send you, wouldn't other people have to stay behind as well. Don't you think?"</p>
<p>The commander and flight commander repeat these words to the squad members every day with painstaking care.</p>
<p>Watanabe: Our base is like that too. A batch of aircraft are transported in, and at the same time, the team members who arrive at the base will be ordered to give the aircraft to others if they are not careful and the aircraft malfunctions. This is the most painful moment for him.</p>
<p>"There is nothing more painful than this, so I often don't land and fly straight to the battlefield."</p>
<p>This is what the driver who was left behind said, with tears in his eyes. The team members who received the aircraft waved the blooming cherry blossoms and branches sent by the nearby female students and bravely from the base where and left to the expedition, and flew to the expedition. The team members who were left behind at the base, when the weather was bad, thought that the aircraft could not reach its destination, so they ran to the airfield and looked up at the sky, waiting for their comrades who had gone on the expedition to return. This situation is exactly like a relay race, anxiously waiting for the person who ran first. The team members who flew back because of aircraft malfunctions had the maintenance soldiers take care of them, but they always did not leave the aircraft, constantly asking, "Is it not done yet?" When it was announced that the aircraft could not be used due to insufficient maintenance soldiers, this team member seemed to have lost consciousness.</p>
<p>Mimuro: This is very true. Whenever we went on an expedition at our base, when we encountered this kind of situation, it was the same as what happened at your base. Therefore, the people at the base love aircraft more than the people in the rear. On the eve of the first big offensive, in the dormitory of the special attack team, everyone was surrounding the staff to talk about the attack tactics for tomorrow. After the tactics were decided, the team leaders immediately conveyed them to their respective special attack team members. The final order was "Don't be impatient and waste the aircraft!" Another sentence was "If the conditions for is not good, fly back safely!" This seems to be another form of motherly love, but in reality it refers to the aircraft. Because the special attack team's creed is "Every aircraft must be taken good care of!" It is using life as a bomb to rush towards the enemy, and it would be a loss to the base to waste this precious living bomb. The maintenance chief also had something to say, "We are responsible for the aircraft malfunctioning." Therefore, if an aircraft malfunctions, they must work all night and mobilize everyone to fix it properly.</p>
<p>Because the maintenance work is too tense, there are often several people every night who immediately jump up when they dream of doing maintenance and repair work. (Translated from Asahi Shimbun, April 18)</p>
<h3>Female Mechanics Active at Northern Bases</h3>
<p>Two new aircraft carrying huge bombs roared into life, and from the base, they flew toward the northern sea, setting out to search for the enemy's tracks. The female mechanics who had carefully maintained the planes, looked up and fixed their gaze, waving goodbye to the beloved aircraft that disappeared in the skies beyond.</p>
<p>The war situation in the north has also become urgent. Now, enemy air raids on Japan's northeastern islands have become more intense day by day. The female mechanics, with their uniquely feminine intuition, had long felt the tension and urgency of the atmosphere at the base.</p>
<p>Determined to Serve the Country Early On</p>
<p>"You are maintenance soldiers serving on the front lines. The aircraft that you repair and maintain participate directly in combat. If they are hit by bullets or suffer serious damage and return, you should immediately start repairing them. The reason why we are implementing strict military education for you is to cultivate your ability to cope with emergencies," said the unit commander.</p>
<p>In fact, they had long since made up their minds. The heroism of Lieutenant Junior Grade Jiro Yokozaki and Ensign Iwao Narikiyo, who had rammed into enemy aircraft over the northern Kuril Islands and died for their country, was from this base. With tears in their eyes, they bid farewell to the brave soldiers who would never return, and made up their minds that even if their noses were frozen off and their hands and feet were injured, they would work hard. Just as the unit commander said, they were all "maintenance special attack soldiers," and they would faithfully complete their assigned tasks.</p>
<p>Excellent Work and Enthusiasm</p>
<p>This unit began employing female mechanics three years ago, and to date, there are 00 members. Wearing combat caps with star badges and dressed in uniform, they were a formidable women's army. The members who joined the unit as a "volunteer corps" last December have now become excellent mechanics. The quality of their work has impressed even the instructors. The new aircraft that they have repaired and maintained are now active on the front lines in the northeast.</p>
<p>The fact that they have been able to achieve such astonishing results in a short period of time is largely due to their enthusiasm. In addition, it is also due to the unit commander's appropriate education. That is, in the "always on the front line" atmosphere, they implement military education, while at the same time teaching thorough basic technical education.</p>
<p>"Working in the military is different from manufacturing aircraft in a factory. Now that you have joined the army, even if you are women, you should be excellent soldiers. This is what I often tell them. In the first week after they join the unit, I teach them to stand at attention, salute, pay attention , quick march, and practice in close order drill, so that they can experience the taste of the military and understand the spirit of soldiers in military training. The biggest flaw of women is being and I also try to correct it, so that they develop the of military personnel. After they have understood the true spirit of soldiers, I begin to teach them basic technical skills. They are very enthusiastic, but basic technical skills are very important. Even a small nail, if it is not nailed correctly, can cause the aircraft to disintegrate in the air. No matter how small the point, if it is not , it will affect the performance of the aircraft. Therefore, within a month of joining the unit, I fully teach them the basic technical knowledge, from the flight principle of the aircraft to the structure, performance, and handling methods of the aircraft, and even a small pipe, must be explained for its function through lectures and objects. The result of this thorough education is that it has achieved results beyond expectations."</p>
<p>As the unit commander said, amidst the deafening roar of engines, the members wearing oil-stained uniforms and short, disheveled hair are concentrating all their attention on repairing and assembling important parts of the ship, such as steel plates, gears, elevators, and rudders. In less than four months since joining the unit, they have learned the basic techniques, and the of their work is no less than that of men.</p>
<p>Using Holidays to Tour and Sing</p>
<p>In order to cultivate their spirit of not being afraid of any difficulties and their "always on the battlefield" mentality, in addition to the twice-monthly exercises, every Wednesday is designated as Kendo Day to encourage the team members to practice martial arts. Recently, in order to improve work efficiency and provide proper entertainment, a harmonica band has been formed under the leadership of the unit commander. At the same time, a choir has also been organized, and on holidays, they tour the various workplaces, singing songs such as "Army," " and "Aviation Japan," and "Patriotic Flower," adding infinite vitality to this strictly disciplined base. The soldiers are all eagerly awaiting the arrival of this harmonica choir.</p>
<p>Normally, from 7:30 am to 5:00 pm, excluding 15-minute breaks in the morning and afternoon, they are working non-stop. They do not feel tired at all, and even the two days off each month are willingly given up, because they want to use their own hands to protect the aircraft that defend the northern sky of the motherland.

<h3>On School Air Defense Work</h3>
<p>— Jiang Yu</p>
<p>Under the active advocacy of the authorities, our city's air defense work has made considerable progress, such as traffic control, emergency evacuation drills, blackout measures, widespread construction of street air raid shelters, and the organization of fire brigades in various Baojia districts. However, internal air defense work within schools, vocational institutions, government agencies, factories, organizations, and neighborhood committees has yet to be effectively implemented. As a result, many chaotic phenomena still occur during air raids, such as people gathering on rooftops to watch, disregarding traffic control regulations, and carelessly leaking lights. As I serve at a school, I have personally witnessed the disorderly flight of our students during enemy bombing raids, with many female students crying and screaming. This shows that citizens still lack basic air defense knowledge. To enable all citizens to calmly deal with future indiscriminate bombing by enemy aircraft, I humbly believe that various agencies, schools, and neighborhood committees should rapidly construct various air defense facilities and universally implement citizen air defense training, with the latter being a particularly urgent task.</p>
<p>Currently, Shanghai has approximately two hundred middle and high schools, and elementary schools are even more numerous. Shutting down these schools due to frequent bombings would be an undesirable solution. The central task for school authorities should be to adapt education to the future wartime environment. I would like to offer my humble suggestions on school air defense work:</p>
<p>(A) Each school should establish an air defense guidance organization to plan all air defense matters for the school, with the following as priorities:</p>
<p>Constructing one or more safe air raid shelters on or near the school grounds capable of accommodating all staff and students.</p>
<p>Offering training courses on basic air defense and first aid knowledge.</p>
<p>Intensifying emergency evacuation drills for the entire school.</p>
<p>Organizing air defense and first aid teams and discipline squads.</p>
<p>Collecting emergency medical supplies, equipment, etc.</p>
<p>(B) The person in charge of the school's air defense organization should be the principal or a representative of the principal, with the participation of teachers and student representatives to ensure unified action throughout the school.</p>
<p>(C) To ensure the smooth progress of work, the following measures may be adopted: Invite personnel from the city's air defense headquarters to come to the school for guidance; establish close contact with the air defense organizations of the Baojia district where the school is located to exchange experiences and cooperate; and cooperate with nearby agencies and residents.</p>
<p>Funding for air defense can be raised through donations, etc., but all accounts must be absolutely transparent to prevent corruption.</p>
<p>However, the true effectiveness of air defense work lies in daily guidance and training, ensuring that all students acquire basic air defense knowledge and training in a short period. On the other hand, students should not abandon their studies under the pretext of the danger of air raids but should actively participate in various air defense services at the school and in the district (such as digging air raid shelters, rescue teams, discipline squads, stretcher teams, etc.). In this way, not only can damage from enemy bombing be reduced, but also studies can continue uninterrupted.</p>
<p>Young students are the backbone of society and should promote the spirit of empathy, encouraging all citizens to actively participate in air defense training.</p>
<p>Finally, I sincerely hope that the responsible authorities of the city's air defense headquarters and the currently established wartime temporary refugee relief committee will promptly pay attention to and plan more in-depth air defense work throughout the city to cope with the increasingly frequent and serious air raids.</p>
<h3>Traffic Problems Between the Western District and the North Station in This City  Shen Xiliang</h3>
<p>The newspaper reported on the 23rd of last month: "The Construction Bureau of this city is concerned about the frequent traffic near the North Station, especially the congestion of vehicles going to and from the station. The original roads are not wide enough, causing considerable inconvenience to travelers. Therefore, there is talk of opening a trunk road directly to the North Station from the northern and southern districts." I will briefly describe what I have observed:</p>
<p>1.  Traditionally, access to the North Station has been via North Zhejiang Road or North Henan Road. These two roads are very narrow and located in the central area, causing considerable inconvenience due to traffic congestion. In the past, trolleys No. 18 and No. 14 could directly reach the North Station, but they are now out of service, relying entirely on rickshaws and tricycles, which makes it even more inconvenient. The Suzhou River meanders from the corner of the sack, forming a river bend, so the roads along the river, such as Xinza Road and Beijing Road, also meander. Citizens living in the western districts of Shanghai who want to go to the North Station must go via Xinza Road and Beijing Road and turn into the North Station via Zhejiang Road, which is a long way around. In accordance with what is called the shortest straight line between two points in geometry, I propose that if a bridge can be built over the Suzhou River at the end of Route Robert and a trunk road can be opened through the Guangzhao Villa, connecting with Guangzhao Road, passing through Datong Road and Xinmin Road, and going directly to the North Station, this road, while not directly connected, is nearly a straight line. The cost is only to build a bridge and open a small section of road! It provides a great deal of convenience to the citizens of the Western District, as they can go to the North Station without going through Zhejiang Road or Henan Road. The congestion on the two roads mentioned above can be reduced, so the opening of this road has great value.</p>
<p>2.  If the construction of this bridge is too expensive, there is an even simpler solution: to use the original Maigen Road Bridge at the end of Card Road (currently impassable), repair it slightly, and then go directly to the North Station via Hengfeng Road through the road and Xinmin Road, which is also very convenient.</p>
<p>I am presenting the above two points for the reference of the Board of Supervisors. If one of them is realized, it will bring great convenience to the citizens of the Western District.</p>
<h3>Vocational Guidance Office of the Social Welfare Bureau</h3>
<p>— Jia Xi</p>
<p>Shanghai's industry and commerce in recent years has shifted from abnormally prosperous to depressed. At the end of the lunar year last year, government agencies and industrial and commercial circles generally experienced layoffs. The widespread stagnation and contraction of industry and commerce has led to an increasing number of unemployed people. No matter how good their academic skills are or how high their service morals are, they still cannot find a job. In small terms, it is a factor of social unrest, Ninghe, and chaos; in large terms, it is a loss to the entire country, so this issue cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>It seems that the general public has not paid attention to this issue. In such a large city as Shanghai, with so many unemployed people, there is only one vocational guidance office attached to the Social Welfare Bureau to deal with this issue. The reporter visited Mr. Yang Chongzhen, the director of the office, who told him in detail about the office's work in introducing occupations. However, what is surprising is that although the number of unemployed people is increasing day by day, not many people are actively seeking jobs at the vocational introduction office (see the detailed numbers below). According to Mr. Yang, the reasons are nothing more than the following:</p>
<p>The office is located in the western corner (the address is No. 200 Yongan Road, formerly Route Remy), and is not widely known to the general public.</p>
<p>The unemployed know that layoffs are a common phenomenon, and even if they register, they may not have much hope.</p>
<p>Most of the unemployed who have recently been laid off can receive a lump sum severance payment or retirement bonus. Some take this opportunity to return to their hometown, and some use it to invest or operate a small business.</p>
<p>The unemployed feel that salaried people can never maintain their lives, so even if they are dismissed, they no longer seek employment and would rather work alone or set up a stall, which may be more profitable.</p>
<p>For specialized technical talents who register at the vocational introduction office, the office will do its best to introduce them to relevant industrial and commercial institutions, or send personnel to visit them and make oral recommendations. However, only 3% or 4% of them can succeed. On the one hand, there is no temporary need for talents in construction, civil engineering, and machinery during the war period. On the other hand, it is also because these talents are not easy-going or condescending, so the introduction of these talents is particularly unsuccessful.</p>
<p>The number of job seekers, the number of employers, and the number of introductions in the past two months are recorded below.</p>
<p>February Male Female Total</p>
<p>Job seekers 644 160 804</p>
<p>Employers 97 37 134</p>
<p>Introduced 40 20 60</p>
<p>March Job seekers 390 138 528</p>
<p>Employers 47 22 69</p>
<p>Introduced 30 14 44</p>
<p>The talents sought by the vocational guidance office are mostly trainees, laborers, and apprentices, followed by school teachers, accountants, typists, and salesmen. As for the motives for seeking public recruitment instead of private introductions, they are nothing more than the following:</p>
<p>Those who need truly outstanding talents can carefully select their excellence from the group introduced in the detailed introduction of the vocational guidance office.</p>
<p>Unwilling to accept the emotional introduction of shareholders and other relevant personnel, and in order to avoid offending anyone, they would rather entrust an introduction agency to introduce them publicly.</p>
<p>The treatment is meager, and it is not easy to hire them in a short period of time.</p>
<p>The nature of the work is relatively specialized, and private introductions from friends and relatives may not be able to do the job satisfactorily.</p>
<p>The registration procedure is very simple. Job seekers only need to go to the office to fill out two registration forms. Then, the staff of the office will ask in detail about the items filled in and observe their actions, abilities, personality, interests, academic ability, etc. from the conversation of the registrants, and make a simple record for reference when the requesters select talents. Then, registration form A will be classified into the registration card box according to their desired or capable positions, so that the requesters can select from the classification when they need any talents. Registration form B will be numbered according to the number of strokes of their names and placed in the registration card box in order, so that the registrant can be found in a few seconds when they come to contact again, as a basis for contacting and talking.</p>
<p>As for those who come to the office to seek talents, they first fill out a request form, stating in detail the conditions and treatment of the talents they need. Then, they select one by one from the A type registration card according to their conditions and hand it over to the requester for self-selection. The office will send a notification to arrange a meeting, and then the office will carefully assess it and send a letter of introduction to the requester's side, and the requester will select one person from five or six people.</p>
<p>Six months after the introduction is completed, the office must solicit the opinions of both the employer and the employee. If there are any differences, the office will mediate to adjust them. If the employer has any criticisms of the person introduced, the office will also be responsible for talking to the person introduced, giving advice or correcting them, until both parties are satisfied.</p>
<p>The vocational introduction office does not charge any fees for this procedure. It is purely for social service and social welfare.</p>
<p>In addition to introducing occupations, the office also has departments for career change guidance, vocational guidance, and employment guidance. If someone is dissatisfied with their current occupation and intends to change to another occupation, they must be persuaded in various ways to make efforts to improve on their own position and strive for happy employment. For those who have just stepped into society from school and are choosing a career, they will be guided on the path and preparation of choosing a career. After obtaining a career, they will also be guided on the attitudes and key points that they should have in service, so as not to lose it again. During each winter and summer vacation, the office will also do its best to provide guidance to graduates of all levels of schools on choosing schools and subjects.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Yang, the two major purposes of the office are to make the unemployed have jobs and to make the employed enjoy their jobs. Mr. Yang also expressed three opinions on relieving unemployment.</p>
<p>Take the opportunity to disperse the population and relocate factories to the interior to set up small factories, and hold a general registration of the unemployed. The registration nature can be divided into three categories: technical talents, technical workers, and ordinary workers, as a preparation for inland factories to recruit workers.</p>
<p>The government should raise a large sum of money to be used as a fund for small loans for the unemployed, so that the unemployed can have the capital to operate a small business.</p>
<p>Take advantage of the fact that hoarders are releasing a large amount of goods and the business of various companies and stores is in a downturn to organize a relief unemployment sales team. All goods that need to be sold can be sold through the sales team. The salesmen will be examined by the host and asked to provide a guarantee. The proceeds from the sales, in addition to the cost and the profit due, will be distributed to the salesmen to maintain their minimum livelihood.</p>
<p>Career guidance and introduction agencies are highly valued and widely established in European and American countries and Japan. Before the war, only the China Vocational Education Society in our country, and after the war, the private career introduction agencies in this city, as of now, except for the career guidance of the Youth Association, which still exists in name, have all been closed. The government-run one is also the only one. It is said that the office's operating expenses are subsidized by the Ministry of Social Welfare, with 50,000 yuan per month. There are only three staff members, and each person's monthly salary is only 7,000 to 8,000 yuan (meals and accommodation are at their own expense). Although it is nominally affiliated to the Municipal Social Welfare Bureau, there is no subsidy. The office had planned to hold a happy employment movement and a study abroad and employment guidance movement, but due to funding reasons, it could not be realized.</p>

<h3>Debt</h3>
<p>— Shuang Chen</p>
<p>Yao'er is sick!</p>
<p>Very sick, it's acute pneumonia. His little mouth is gasping for breath, the movement of his eyes is sluggish, his two little hands are clenched tightly, spasmodically against his chest, his two little lips change from rose to purple, to white, to black; how can a child of only eight full months bear such a disease? So the whole family is in chaos, my wife is sobbing and tearful, at a loss, trembling and shouting: "What, what to do: ah?" My heart is even more panicked, even more at a loss, pacing around the room, muttering words I don't know what I'm saying.</p>
<p>The child's little hands convulsed for a while, seeming to be a little better, lying on the small bed, his face was pale, breathing slightly short, his little eyes half open and half closed... struggling, fighting with his little life. I couldn't bear to look at this pitiful sight. At this moment, I really hate my own weakness and insignificance, unable to cure even a small child; I wish I could immediately transform myself and take the child's place, the child's illness would immediately move to my own body, and I would bear and endure all the child's suffering myself. But these are ultimately fantasies, which do nothing to help the reality, and will not reduce the child's illness by a single point.</p>
<p>My wife put the palm of her hand on the child's forehead and uttered such a sentence: "It's very hot!" Then, with a worried face, she complained to me: "Hey, think of a way! It's not a solution to continue like this." My wife's words made me sober up, reminding me of the idea of ​​finding a doctor immediately. Originally, finding a doctor when you are sick is the most important problem, and it is also the most common problem, but I was so anxious about my son's illness that I forgot about this most important thing.</p>
<p>"Finding a doctor" came to mind, but the next problem came again, first, which doctor to find? Second, where is the money to invite the doctor? The first question was finally settled after a thousand requests for teaching and ten thousand inquiries. We decided to invite Dr. Chen, a pediatrician with rich experience. But the consultation fee is very high, and the cost of injections and medicines constitutes an astonishing number in the eyes of the poor, which is also the most difficult second money problem to solve!</p>
<p>Secretly discussing with my wife: the little money I had saved before has been used to buy firewood and rice as much as possible - these things increase in price day and night and cannot be left out every day, and some remaining change has to be arranged for daily household expenses, in addition to which there is really no surplus, let alone a sum of money and such huge medical expenses? Now the only way is to borrow money from someone, but who to borrow from? Can I borrow it? Can't I borrow it? There is another series of difficult problems to solve. I try my best to search my mind again and again, but the result of the search always comes to a "〇". The familiar friends around me who are usually friendly enough are like me, or even not as good as me. They are all salaried classes who live on a fixed income. They are suffering under the pressure of life, living in a humble way, sending off the bitter days, and exclaiming at the life of tomorrow. Really, even the problem of their own survival is threatened at all times, let alone sharing a little surplus money to help others? As for the general friends who have had a glimpse or are "climbing high," of course, first, they are not friendly enough to be embarrassed to speak; second, I can't "drill," "flatter," or "toady"... these skills of making a living and getting rich. Otherwise, I wouldn't have to worry and be so poor because of a little illness of my son! But the child's illness must be treated, and the money must naturally be raised, so in desperation, I reluctantly think of a way, that is, to cooperate with my wife to borrow money separately. My wife's only way to get money is to discuss it with her parents' family, but the relationship between my wife and her two sisters-in-law has never been harmonious. Now, it is difficult for a woman who usually cherishes her face to do this kind of loaning thing - but for the sake of her child, or rather, the power of maternal love, she surprisingly agreed. I had to go to my poor friends' place, although I knew it would be a fruitless trip, and the child left behind had to be temporarily looked after by an old woman in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>The first step out of the door, my heart was in a mess. Which one should I look for first? After careful planning and careful consideration, I had to set off to the place of Mr. K, who was closer and had a better living condition, but as soon as I entered the door, my hope was shattered. Mr. K was lying sick in bed, and his wife was guarding the stove to decoct medicine. She told me in detail that her husband had been sick for a week, and the children were crying and shouting in the house, and the objects were piled up messily in the corner, which showed that Mr. K's illness was not light and his recent situation was down and out. When I saw Mr. K's sad face, I had no choice but to step forward and comfort him first, and then said goodbye in a hurry. Then I looked for a few poor friends, but I saw their poverty and embarrassment, and I lost the courage to borrow money from them. In fact, even if I opened my mouth to them, they would not satisfy my slightest hope in their situation of being unable to take care of themselves. Finally, an idea that I didn't want to think about was circulating in my mind. My primary school classmate, Mr. C, is now a nouveau riche and a prominent social celebrity. Although our opinions are different and our interests are not in line, relying on the friendship of six years of classmates, I think it will not be rejected to borrow a little money, but how unwilling should I be to do this kind of "thing against my wish"! But for the sake of money, for the sake of the child's illness, finally my feet involuntarily hesitated in front of the magnificent C mansion, and I mustered the courage for the third time before pressing the doorbell. The door opened, and an arrogant porter came out, looking me up and down. I reluctantly handed over a business card and stated my intention. He lazily led me into the reception room and did not greet me very much, so he went straight in. I stood tremblingly in the corner of the room, and saw my thin and haggard face from the dressing mirror, and my shabby clothes. How unharmonious it was to be in the grand and magnificent mansion! It was natural for the porter to cast a suspicious look at me. I waited, waited, for a long time the porter came out, I tidied my clothes, preparing to meet my old friend who had been separated for many years, but the porter replied coldly: "The master is not at home." I had to leave disappointed, and before leaving, I left a message on the card stating that I would visit again tomorrow. Under repeated requests, the porter finally reluctantly accepted it. Half a day of running around, the result was nothing. I had no resentment for wasting so much energy and time; but I was very worried about the child's illness and the money to treat the child's illness. Thinking like this, my legs were weak, flashing sparks exploded in my brain, and I was dizzy, almost falling down. I persisted with all my strength, resisting, but my precarious body was sometimes tilting to the left and right, and my pace slowed down. At this moment, I was suddenly awakened by the sound of a car "whirring, whirring". I quickly gave way to the side of the road, and the car slid past. But I suddenly saw the man in a suit sitting in the car, who was exactly the Mr. C I wanted to see, with a coquettish woman, leaving behind a string of frivolous and unrestrained laughter behind the car. At this time, I wanted to catch up and greet him, but the car had already sped away like lightning. Suddenly I looked back and the door of the C mansion was not far from me, and it can be determined that this car had just come out of this mansion, so I immediately realized that he had deliberately refused to see me. I stood blankly on the road, thinking foolishly, thinking foolishly, words such as "morality"... "human relationships"... "money"... "friends"... were all chaotically reflected and intertwined in my mind. But I didn't get a clue. I felt that I was insulted, and I immediately returned to the C mansion, retrieved the business card, and tore off the message on it on the spot. This kind of shame added to me, even pouring out the water of the entire West River, would not be enough to wash it clean! I glared at the porter and returned home with heavy steps!</p>
<p>But when I got home, I was like a defeated rooster, dragging a frustrated and slow pace. I met the threshold of my home with the strength of a thousand pounds. What is the responsibility of being a father? What can I explain to the child's illness? But what came back was an empty-handed, helpless poor bug, and the child who belonged to the poor bug was even more pitiful. I really couldn't bear to think about it anymore...</p>
<p>But unexpectedly, as soon as I entered the house, I saw that the house was crowded with people. The doctor was here, the mother-in-law was here, and my wife was busy dealing with it. Yao'er had already had two blood cleanings, one injection of grape juice, and drank a little medicine water, and was already able to sleep quietly!</p>
<p>After the doctor finished his task, he left in a hurry. The money was paid by my wife, of course, borrowed from my mother-in-law.</p>
<p>At this time, my mother-in-law habitually raised her tongue and nagged: "Why didn't you call me earlier? Alas! You shouldn't have made the child like this! You should have seen a doctor earlier when you are sick! Fortunately, now it seems that the child's illness is probably not serious..." Such a mother-in-law's nagging words would inevitably make me disgusted or even run away and ignore her in normal times, but now when I heard them, I felt an unusually kind and interesting feeling. I even felt that there was warmth in the world because of this. At the same time, the anger and obstruction I had just suffered were mixed with the current gratitude. A surge of hot tears exploded from my heart and rolled down unconsciously. I quickly wiped them away secretly.</p>
<p>After two more diagnoses and two weeks of recuperation, the child's illness gradually improved! And the father's debt was gradually accumulating, turning from a pile of small stones into a small mountain. Naturally, all these money came from my mother-in-law, and my mother-in-law's family was not well-off, so these money naturally came from somewhere else. I don't know how I will repay her in the future? At the same time, I dare not think: what kind of idle words are the two sisters-in-law saying behind my back? From now on, it is even more impossible to talk about maintaining my wife's face? And I don't know how much trouble this old lady has caused in the mother-in-law relationship? Ah ah! I really dare not continue to think about it!</p>
<p>Now the child's illness is considered completely cured. He can stand on my lap and laugh and play. His little mouth hangs with an innocent smile, and his two little hands are waving wildly in the air. My wife smiled and said: "This little life was picked up, how dangerous!" I also smiled along, but there were tears in the smile. From the I told me that my face was much thinner and haggard. Sometimes I woke up in the middle of the night and felt that there was something that had not been done well? Then I thought of the "debt". It was like a thousand-pound stone pressing on my heart, squeezing, squeezing; it was also like thousands of small on my heart wall, ing, sucking... so that I would never</p>
<p>From now on, I am really afraid to see " ", and I don't know how to pay it back? Ah ah! What about the days after, child! "Debt"! "Life"! What to do? Let's not talk about it!</p>
<h3>Sacrificing for Work</h3>
<p>— Bai Ding</p>
<p>Sacrifice, is this what sacrifice is like? Your blood never flowed on the battlefield, your sweat never soaked the battle robe, yet, in the vast crowd of Liaoguan, you have silently sunk away like this, and your image is gradually fading in people's memories. Can the meaning of sacrifice be so great, and yet so small?</p>
<p>Forgotten, you have been so easily forgotten. A spark has burned out the plains of your life, leaving behind only a pile of cold ashes, a gust of wind! How unbearable it is to forget, yet how easy it is to forget?!</p>
<p>Dead, have you died just like that? I watched you tossing and groaning, but in an instant, why did you become so weakly silent? The boundary between life and death! It seems so close, and yet so distant!…</p>
<p>Walking past ward sixteen in the morning, unaccustomed, I caught sight of the empty bed raised high, like the human skeleton in anatomy class; so empty. The gray figure under the dim light resurfaced in my mind--</p>
<p>Everyone knew that L-jun's illness was hopeless. The dreadful terminal tuberculosis. So the news of his death didn't shock anyone, because when he was still alive, people didn't consider him living. It was just that the nurse made one more bed in the morning, took two more tablets of calcium lactate when dispensing medicine, and the doctor mechanically turned his chart over. Day after day, year after year, it became too habitual. It was as if this matter, this person, didn't exist. Until one less bed was made, the medication card was taken away, and the chart was removed, only then did people realize something had happened—a break in routine—they said, "Oh, he's dead!" Seeming a bit sorry, but then they went back to doing other things with a smile; there were still many beds to make, medicine to dispense, injections to give, etc... They were busy working, darting back and forth among various bacteria, just like L-jun used to work. But the tuberculosis bacteria let L-jun rest, forever!</p>
<p>The bell of the Jianghai Customs rang ten times, and I still hadn't gotten off work, but my eyes were getting heavy. There was a magazine spread out on the desk, but I couldn't focus on a single word. Suddenly the electric bell rang, it was ward sixteen. L-jun's older sister gently said to me, "He's not doing well, he's rambling and saying strange things, I'm a little scared, please keep me company." I immediately agreed, put on a mask, and stood blankly beside L-jun's bed with her.</p>
<p>It was indeed a bit frightening. L-jun's eyes were wide open; rolling in his deep-set sockets, his dull gaze slowly moving from left to right, then slowly from the window to the door. It was truly a sight that made one break out in a cold sweat. His thin hands, no, just withered branches; trembled and reached out towards the door. He began to move his wooden lips; "Look, two people are coming!" We followed his gaze to the door; but who was coming? But it seemed as if those two invisible people had entered, L-jun raised his arms, shaking them, pointing, nodding, his lips moving laboriously, as if he were talking to those two people, perhaps even speaking English. Curious, I leaned closer to listen, but couldn't understand two sentences. Those terrifying eyeballs slowly moved to my face, "You… you…" He said two words to me, then stopped abruptly, making me involuntarily take two steps back. "Close your eyes, don't imagine things, your sister is here with you." His sister lowered his hand, smoothed the blanket, and said in a trembling voice, "Oh... you... you are my third sister…" He seemed a bit more lucid, and weakly closed his eyelids. I softly asked Miss L, "Are you his third sister?" "No, my third sister isn't in Shanghai, he... he can't even recognize me..." She wiped away tears with a handkerchief, not crying out loud. She was also a nurse. The room was very quiet, only L-jun's labored breathing, exhaling but not inhaling, made our nerves tense. Gurgling sounds, as if there was a lot of phlegm in his throat. We took a sputum cup and tried to get him to spit, but he still knew to try, but was too weak to spit it out; we turned his head to the side, but still nothing came out. We noticed the black part of his eyes, gradually rolling upwards, upwards, until only the whites were left, his eyelids half-closed, and his mouth wide open, his white teeth exposed. Miss L put down the sputum cup, took my hand, and cried out mournfully. What could I say to comfort her? My own eyes were already soaked in tears as well. "There's nothing to be done, I'm the only one in Shanghai, please have them wrap him up and take him to the morgue! I... I'll come... come to collect the body tomorrow morning..." She covered her face and ran out into the hallway.</p>
<p>Turning back, the gray corpse under the dim light actually made me feel cowardly, and I quickly closed the screen and ran to report to the doctor.</p>
<p>The doctor came and listened to his heart, and many colleagues also came. In a moment, L-jun, wrapped in a white sheet, was carried out of ward sixteen by the workers…</p>
<h3>Meteor</h3>
<p>— Bai Fan</p>
<p>The meteor in the deep night has a seductive beauty. That shrewd gaze makes people sad, and moss of melancholy grows all over the heart, unable to contain the sparks of desire in the gaps. What is it about its charm that makes people sigh? The radiance ignites youthful eyes. Oh, clever ones, don't be mocked! The dazzling meteor is romantic, aloof, and that bizarre smile makes people panic. As it streaks across the dark night, in the mournful wind, withered grasses groan painfully; laugh, clever ones, be as indifferent as cold branches, and hide your trembling hearts deep in the valleys to weep for the meteor, that seductive beauty.</p>
<h3>Gleanings of Floating Duckweed</h3>
<p>— Lu Wen</p>
<p>"A bosom friend afar brings a distant land near." —Wang Bo—</p>
<p>Preface</p>
<p>People often compare the gatherings and separations in this world to floating duckweed. If this analogy is appropriate, then I will love duckweed even more. Because recently, in an extraordinarily coincidental opportunity, I was reunited with three people whom I had parted ways with a long time ago, and at the time of our initial farewell, none of us had imagined that we would ever see each other again. For this reason, I have written down some things, for myself and for others.</p>
<p>One: Teacher</p>
<p>After the streetcar stopped at a station, another group of passengers squeezed in. One of them was holding a large leather bag in one hand and trying to get his money out with the other. The streetcar started, and the car body shook, causing that passenger to fall on a seated passenger—me.</p>
<p>So I closed the magazine I was reading and looked up.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, I'm sorry."</p>
<p>But before he could finish apologizing, I had already exclaimed:</p>
<p>"Ah! Mr. Ma!"</p>
<p>I stood up and offered him my seat.</p>
<p>"Let me think…" He sat down: "You're from Y Middle School, aren't you? …You seem to be called Lu… Lu……"</p>
<p>"Lu Wei-bao!" I stood in front of him, like a child: "Mr. Ma doesn't recognize me anymore."</p>
<p>"I recognize you, I recognize you." Mr. Ma smiled happily: "However, in recent years, my brain has become increasingly worse than before."</p>
<p>Without a doubt, Mr. Ma was a good teacher. When I was studying at Y Middle School, he taught us advanced algebra and trigonometry, and his explanations were really clear. Because he was teaching at six schools at the same time, due to scheduling constraints, his classes were often arranged after the last period, from six to seven o'clock. But we all waited for the class to start, and no one ran away.</p>
<p>"Does Mr. Ma still eat dinner on the streetcar now?" I suddenly remembered something.</p>
<p>"Yes. There's really no way around it. …Sometimes there are no streetcars, so I have to run on my two legs."</p>
<p>Looking at the teacher's gray hair, (the top of his head was already a bit bald,) I felt like I had nothing to say. —Yes, what else could I say?</p>
<p>"Where are you working now?" After a long while, he looked up and asked.</p>
<p>"I'm teaching arithmetic at a middle school." I mumbled in reply. I felt like I was insignificant in front of that teacher.</p>
<p>But this sparked his sigh:</p>
<p>"Time really flies, you're teaching at a middle school too."</p>
<p>"Mr. Ma is currently…?" I interrupted, wanting to break the awkward atmosphere.</p>
<p>"Me? I'm still messing around at those few schools." The gray-haired old teacher sighed deeply: "Still the same as before. Sending class after class from junior high to senior high, giving them exams, sending them off to graduate, enter university… then sending a new batch from junior high into senior high…"</p>
<p>"Mr. Ma is truly tireless in his teaching…"</p>
<p>"It's not like that, life forces you to, otherwise who would be willing to run around all day long? …I heard that Mr. Liu from Y Middle School, recently made several deals in Western medicine, worth nearly ten million. …I just can't do it, and to this day it's still 'nothing accomplished, hair streaked with gray'…"</p>
<p>The streetcar stopped, and Mr. Ma stood up hurriedly.</p>
<p>"I've arrived. Come to my house to chat when you have time, I'd really like to hear about how you teach arithmetic?"</p>
<p>Looking at the shadow of the white-haired old teacher on the sidewalk, a strange feeling rose from my heart.</p>
<p>Two: Old Classmate</p>
<p>I saw the name of an old classmate in a magazine, indulged in a moment of sentimentality, and wrote a letter to ask about him. Half a month later, I received a reply; my letter was not written in vain. This was truly something that no one had expected, a classmate from a village elementary school in our hometown, separated for ten years, would meet again in the midst of war and chaos. Moreover, what a bizarre encounter this was!</p>
<p>That classmate wrote at the end of the letter:</p>
<p>"...In half a month, I will come to Shanghai for magazine matters,</p>
<p>When the time comes, I will visit you at your residence to chat about what we have been up to since we last met.…"</p>
<p>I waited with a warm heart.</p>
<p>Before half a month had passed, I received another letter:</p>
<p>"…Recently, worldly affairs have been numerous and busy, leaving me with almost no free time. I have had to cancel my trip to Shanghai. The date of our reunion will have to be postponed to another day.…"</p>
<p>I thought about how the gatherings and separations of life are originally like floating duckweed, like flying catkins. It's not common to run into each other again after being separated for ten years, is it? What did the poet Du Fu say?</p>
<p>"Life is separation: like the stars of Shen and Shang."</p>
<p>Just like that old classmate, I was only in the same fifth-grade class with him for one semester before I skipped to junior high. And during our time at school, we weren't exactly close friends, just ordinary classmates. When we parted ways, there was certainly no talk of farewells, because we children didn't understand such things at all, and besides, we were separated almost as soon as we met.</p>
<p>"How have the last ten years changed him?"</p>
<p>Back then, he was called a "model student." The meaning of "model student" included good grades, neat handwriting, listening to the teacher, sitting up straight in class, and always trimming fingernails, etc.</p>
<p>"Is he still like that now?" I wondered.</p>
<p>I don't know if we will have the chance to meet again, life's gatherings and separations are originally like broken stems of floating duckweed. However, if such things are ultimately rare, I am satisfied with the current outcome. Thank you, green-clad messenger, for sending a little thought of longing for the departed. Well, let us hold onto this hopeful heart until the very end.</p>
<p>Three: Student</p>
<p>At a street corner, I ran into a student from a free school that I ran two years ago.</p>
<p>To make way for a truck, he jumped off an old bicycle.</p>
<p>The boy looked up blankly, looking around:</p>
<p>"Oh, Mr. Lu!"</p>
<p>"Where are you working now?" I suddenly felt that this question was inappropriate. Other than the free school, he wouldn't be transferred around like some students. So I immediately changed my question: "What are you doing now?"</p>
<p>"Carrying rice." He pointed to his bicycle: "I carry it to Beixinjing or Qishi every day."</p>
<p>"Your father? —How did it come to the point that you have to carry rice?"</p>
<p>"Dad died last year. He cut himself on the barbed wire, got injured, came back and slept for three days, then—"</p>
<p>"How much rice can you carry?" I looked at his old bicycle.</p>
<p>"I can probably carry more than one dan, sometimes I can carry two dan. An uncle of mine is more capable than me, he can carry three dan."</p>
<p>"Three dan? How do you arrange it on the bike?"</p>
<p>"Look, I arrange it like this!" He gestured:</p>
<p>"Hang one dan on this side, one dan on that side, and pile another dan on top."</p>
<p>"What about your younger sister?" I remembered that he had a younger sister who was in the third grade back then.</p>
<p>"Younger sister? She's selling vegetables with my mother now. —Mr. Lu, do you have a watch? What time is it now?"</p>
<p>"Half past eleven." I said.</p>
<p>"Then I have to go, people are still waiting for me over there. Goodbye, Mr. Lu."</p>
<p>"Goodbye," I watched him jump on the bike.</p>
<p>How ashamed I should be. Such a child has already placed the burden of life on his own shoulders, and he, this child who is at most fourteen years old, is not afraid at all, walking the path that people want him to walk.</p>
<p>I remembered that in school, this child, Wu Hai-xiong, was often a headache for the teachers. He wouldn't listen in class; he wouldn't do his homework; he was always the one causing trouble; he was also the one cheating during exams—</p>
<p>But now, look, how he has changed.</p>
<p>Do you know how steel is made? How is it made?</p>

<h3>Youth and Youth Day</h3>
<p>— Shao Yu-gang</p>
<p>In the season of rippling spring breezes, we have finally waited for Youth Day again.</p>
<p>This ancient Asian country, full of suffering and calamity, in modern history, shouldered the heavy fate of the nation. Treading on fire disasters, man-made disasters, foreign invasions, and internal turmoil, starting from the Opium War of 1838, it has already been one hundred and seven years.</p>
<p>In this situation of continuous warfare and exhausted people, the young Chinese sons and daughters, generation after generation, spanning two centuries, tasted all the sweetness, sourness, bitterness, and spiciness. In the most difficult spiritual and material conditions, they shouldered the unfinished historical obligations left by their ancestors—those thorns on the road to the new century that should have been swept away long ago—and the unfinished revolutionary cause since the Xinhai Revolution. Our previous generations only did some superficial and empty things. The difficult and enormous practical work, however, was left behind. This is deeply rooted and stubborn, but their descendants, seeing the precariousness of their motherland, finally bravely ignored how heavy and thorny it was, and quickly started working on it.</p>
<p>The Opium War knocked open the door of this aging dynasty, ushering in an epoch-making first time that all Chinese descendants comprehensively opposed the encroachment of the international white race on their country; the vigorous Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolutionary movement of 1849 revealed the young generation's strong and boundless will to resist the dark feudal forces; the Xinhai Uprising under the Wuchang city and the success of the Northern Expedition of the Revolutionary Army further demonstrated that our excellent descendants of the Yellow Emperor, for the brilliant future of the new China, truly possessed great irresistible power!</p>
<p>Our young generation was born amidst fierce and violent artillery fire; grew strong amidst the bloodstains of the martyrs who fell one after another. The youth have been forged to be very brave, and they are no longer afraid, no matter what great difficulties they will encounter. Although China is still in the midst of battle, has not yet broken out of this dark wilderness, and there are still many bumps and hardships arranged on the road, they will finally be cleared and eliminated. The Chinese youth of the 1940s should be proud. The law of history has designated them—to be great combatants and flag bearers for the completion of the Greater East Asia War and the promotion of peace. How should they, with great confidence, march forward, treading on barbed wire?!</p>
<p>The fate of China is multifaceted; the Chinese youth have suffered. For a century, they have been subjected to the bullying of foreign races and the oppression of rites and teachings. Therefore, the precocious Chinese youth finally stood up and said what they wanted to say. The great May Fourth Movement was our first loud cry. Young people resolutely insisted: "Demand innovation! Demand thorough innovation!"</p>
<p>In the first glorious fact in the history of the youth movement, Shanghai youth cannot be separated. She has had glorious days of honor. She is the beating heart of Chinese youth, just like the position Shanghai occupies in the country.</p>
<p>Undeniably, today's Shanghai youth have not done enough to fulfill their historically due obligations. A part of college students abandoned their precious time, and went madly on with their fashionable playthings; a part of professional youth were often confused by the abnormal psychology of crazy speculation and hoarding, and confused their own nature; a part of young girls were obsessed with competing with their fashions… Naturally, this is only a part of people who are willing to degenerate, those wastes who are about to become the dregs of the era, and are not worthy of people's pity. Youth! How can we explain this? Will history lightly forgive us for the past?</p>
<p>However, time will never wait for you and forgive us. Soon, we will step into the thrilling days of late May again! In this season of blood and enmity, there is our own intimate day! —The youthful, leaping, hot, great "5/5" festival has arrived!</p>
<p>What achievements can we use to approach her? Do we feel pride or shame?</p>
<p>Youth Day is great, but only under the love and support of the vast majority of outstanding youth can it exert a wonderful greatness; youth is precious, but it should be in the Youth Day, we can examine our own strength and dare to reveal our shortcomings, it can be regarded as precious, we should remember her organic chain, to make deep reflection.</p>
<p>Youth! Please be frank and count your own debts on this "5/5" festival!</p>
<h3>Retrospective and Prospects of Shanghai Youth Movement in the Past Two Years</h3>
<p>— Xiao Yi</p>
<p>In March of the 33rd year, gambling dens in the Nanshi district were suddenly demolished by a group of spirited young students. The people of Shanghai, after being stunned and cheering, became familiar with this group of courageous young men, which was the first time the Shanghai youth showed themselves to the people of Shanghai with practical activities.</p>
<p>In fact, the formal emergence of a systematic organizational force among the vast youth groups began with the establishment of the old eight districts sub-branch in the 33rd year. At that time, it had more than 20,000 young people inside and outside the schools, and 198 trained cadres. The work progressed smoothly at that time, so it was able to achieve such high achievements because there was a best condition existing, that is, the youth group and the Baojia authorities achieved close ties.</p>
<p>Throughout the year of the 33rd year, the main work was to cultivate local cadres in various regions of the old eight districts (divided by Baojia areas), so the tentacles of the work had not yet penetrated into the vast youth and student layers of various industrial and school departments, but the training of junior cadres was successful. But good times do not last long. With the merger of the administrative institutions of the first and second districts, the original sincere cooperation between "Youth" and "Bao" was declared separated due to various difficulties and setbacks.</p>
<p>Since the second half of the 33rd year, with no office expenses at the top and a lack of staff at the bottom, relying on the youthful innocence of the young people, overcoming all obstacles and difficulties, and after all the hardships, finally supported the new model of the first district branch. By the end of the year, there were more than 200 members, but most of them were old comrades left over from the training class of cadres in the old eight districts, who were working together because of their like-mindedness.</p>
<p>In February of the 34th year, the branch address began to move from Fangbang Road to Paomade. The location was suitable, and the work had a new look. Therefore, new members from the old first district and the western part of Shanghai continued to join. Now there are nearly 400 members, and more than ten full-time staff members under the command.</p>
<p>At this point, the new model of the district branch is almost complete.</p>
<p>During this period, there are two main tasks:</p>
<p>The first is to fully rectify the internal organization and discipline. — (At that time, it was found that one or two unscrupulous elements, taking advantage of the transition between the old and the new of the branch and the lack of staff, impersonated the name of the district branch, and cheated, intimidated and harassed in some taverns and teahouses in the old eight districts. However, after the case was investigated, they were expelled and punished. This phenomenon was quickly eliminated. If any circles find it in the future, please notify this branch to punish them severely.) This point is generally successful. Up to now, the general affairs, training, coaching, and organization under the command have all undergone thorough mobilization to seek innovation; at the same time, more than 200 young comrades have also undergone individual heart-to-heart talks, trying to unify their political ideas and work goals, and trying to avoid being drafted in a perfunctory manner, so as to achieve the excellent level of consciously and spontaneously participating in the work.</p>
<p>The second is to strengthen service and expand publicity. Any major gathering and association in Shanghai is inseparable from the first district branch. The most prominent ones are the Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Birthday Tree Planting Day Conference, the Capital Returning Commemoration Conference, the Unified National People's Congress... all of which are responsible for the entire arrest work of the conference by this district branch (At the same time, nearly half of the comrades in this district branch participated in the fourth brigade and fourth battalion of the Model Youth Corps of the Republic of China. Therefore, the fourth brigade's work is also the dispatch of some cadres and comrades of the district branch) Especially the lectures in theaters and teahouses on the Capital Returning Commemoration Day were praised by the social people. For example, when the comrades of our lectures left after finishing their lectures in the Majestic Grand Theater and Dadong Xindu and other teahouses, within one or two minutes, there was still cheers and applause, proving that the audience was moved, and it also showed that the work had achieved a part of the effect.</p>
<p>Recently, in view of the increasingly harsh Great East Asia War, Shanghai has approached the edge of the artillery fire. Everything related to local security, wartime air defense; the evacuation of population and industry; the relief of out-of-school and unemployed people; all need local officials and social advances to advocate in front; and the vast youth to act after, but the youth without organization can not play a role. The district branch deeply understands this, so it selects 200 outstanding young people inside and outside the school above the high school level (which can be expanded if the industrial associations cooperate in the future) to organize a service team to be used when the municipal government authorities and all sectors of society have important work to serve, but in the case of soaring labor and production, a poor civil movement organization, if it does not get the financial assistance of the industrial sectors in the society, can not do it anyway. It happened that this district branch planned to perform "The Soul of the Party Member" by one of the affiliated youth drama clubs at the Majestic Grand Theater to celebrate the May Fourth Youth Day and expand the publicity effect, and planned to perform four shows at the Queen's Grand Theater on May 11, 12, 14, and 15 to collect financial assistance from all walks of life for the organization of the service team.</p>
<p>The above is the organizational status and general work of this district branch.</p>
<p>Obviously, the Shanghai youth movement is progressing in a very deformed and extremely chaotic process. The names and systems of the organization are really diverse. In addition to the Shanghai Municipal Branch of the China Youth League and its affiliated school district branches, there are also the air defense groups and self-defense groups organized by the Baojia Office (It is said that these similar organizations are recently planned to be merged into the Model Self-Defense Corps) This organization has the largest scale and is widely spread throughout Shanghai. In addition, there are the Sino-Japanese Youth Comrades Association, the China Youth Construction Team, etc., and its meaning is more single, such as the College Student Crime Prevention Research Association, the College Student Academic Research Association, etc. As a result, they are divided into four and five, and each goes its own way, so the strength is dispersed, and they can only do some empty formal work. In fact, which group can be said to have organization and strength?</p>
<p>Secondly, the municipal government officials and social advances can listen to the voices of the youth, care about the lives of the youth, and believe in the strength of the youth, and boldly give them work to do, and at the same time, they must supervise them to do it seriously. Under the condition that it does not conflict with their occupation and studies, the youth are willing to serve the society.</p>
<p>In March of this month, the reorganization of the New Movement Branch has not been completed. Mr. Gu Senqian, who is wise, capable, experienced, and rich, served as the Secretary-General of the New Movement Branch and concurrently served as the Deputy Commander of the Municipal League Affairs. At the joint celebration of the Municipal District League to welcome Deputy Commander Gu, Deputy Commander Gu sincerely gave us a speech, reiterating that the youth movement in Shanghai will have a bright future in the short term; all difficult problems will be properly solved, and he hoped that the comrades would not be afraid of difficulties and retreat, and should continue to work with the will of not being afraid of difficulties...</p>
<p>Yes, we will definitely continue to work with the will of absolute belief and not being afraid of difficulties, and achieve results in a certain short period of time.</p>
<h3>Work Report</h3>
<p>The first district branch recently plans to organize a service team, and welcomes young people with a high school degree or above to participate. It is especially welcome if the industrial associations and colleges and universities can submit a written guarantee. The branch address is at No. 101 Jiangyin Road.</p>
<p>The Shanghai West Office of the First District Branch will start the first cadre concentration training on April 30. The registration is very enthusiastic. It is reported that more than 60 people have been selected and started training.</p>
<p>Ten representatives of the Shanghai team participated in the third capital review of the National Youth League of this year. They gathered at the first district branch at 4:30 am on May 2 and set off together, taking the 8 o'clock express train to Beijing.</p>
<p>The Yi Qing Drama Club is about to perform "The Soul of the Party Member" at the Queen, scheduled from the 11th to the 15th of this month, and will rehearse at the Queen's Grand Theater on May 4, and will perform on May 5 to celebrate, I heard that the drama troupe will continue to rehearse Bihua Blood and Yunnan Uprising in the future, and a large number of male and female actors are needed. Young men and women who love drama can sign up to participate.</p>
<h3>The Future of Shanghai Youth</h3>
<p>— Chen Ping</p>
<p>The active, youthful, and great "May Fourth" Youth Day has arrived at the time of the urgent Great East Asia War! Commemorating this historical and extensive youth festival today has very important significance. Recalling what Mr. Kosaka Masayasu, the representative of the allied nation Japan, said at the Great East Asia Youth Leaders Symposium last year: "The highest ideal of the Japanese Youth League movement is to unite the strength of Japanese youth and contribute to the country." Under this highest goal, the Japanese youth movement has shown a new and heroic attitude in increasing its work. The youth movements in other allied countries and in Europe and the United States have also made heroic achievements in the current war situation. This proves that the strength of the youth is great and cannot be underestimated, and it is the lifeblood of the country and the nation, and it is the element of building new and creating new.</p>
<p>The Shanghai youth movement has occupied a glorious page in the history of the Chinese youth movement! In the autumn of the crisis of the survival of the country, they contributed their strength and flesh and blood! In the death of the blood of the corrupt old society, they bravely injected their fresh blood! All this shows that the characteristics of young people are pure and enthusiastic, they are sharp feelers of the real society, and they are the driving force of the real society!</p>
<p>However, today, the Shanghai youth movement is not only in a low stage but also has formed a serious crisis. The special deformed development of Shanghai society has caused the vast youth to be dissatisfied with the status quo and to be depressed about the status quo. The deepening development of this phenomenon has pushed the vigorous climax of the past Shanghai youth movement into the trend of depression and pushed it into the sewage ditch of decline and depravity. Today, the most serious depression disease of Shanghai youth is the hope for themselves and the inability to withstand the blows of the environment. School youth are desperately studying in books, but their hearts painfully feel that the fate of dropping out of school has been sentenced. Professional youth work hard from morning to night, and the result they get cannot take care of their families and cannot fill their stomachs. In the midst of the sound of layoffs, they are worried about their poor jobs. And the vast number of young people who are abandoned outside the gate of society are wandering all day long. Although most of the young people are free and normal from the outside, there are great defects in practice. They are running around in the stock market, inquiring enthusiastically about transactions, and are happy in various games and gatherings. These phenomena indicate that young people are spinning in the reverse current of retreat, in the selfish struggle for profit, and in the venting of abnormal depression. "Dropping out of school," "unemployment," "thought," and "life" These depression diseases are seriously growing in the corners of young people's lives. The basic source of this is that the war has changed everything about Shanghai society, and at the same time, the complex economic development of Shanghai society itself has affected the uneasiness of many people's lives. However, we cannot allow this decline, selfishness, and corruption to continue to exist. At present, we are facing the decisive battle period of the Great East Asia War, and it is urgent to mobilize the strength of all participating countries. Moreover, the youth are the largest force to defend the country and protect the society? Especially in the future, the environment in Shanghai will be in danger of air raids. Mobilizing the Shanghai part of the force to ensure the order of the local society and the security of the society, and to alleviate the spread of the air defense crisis, and to assist in increasing production and evacuating the population, these are the urgent tasks of the Shanghai people in the future, and they are also the practical tasks that the Shanghai youth should shoulder.</p>
<p>We firmly believe that in this historical and urgent period, the Shanghai youth brothers will bravely open up their own bright and glorious future, and will certainly live up to the important responsibilities given by the society and the country. And we believe that our country and all sectors of society will step up their leadership and help to us. Therefore, we strengthen the following work confidence and goals.</p>
<p>In this urgent period of the Great East Asia War, the Shanghai crisis has intensified, so the work of ensuring local security and social security, and assisting the government's production increase work are important parts of the youth work.</p>
<p>Mobilizing the national strength to serve the war is holistic, and young people should bravely participate first, so stepping up their physical exercise and strict training of military skills is the most realistic course for young people.</p>
<p>Assisting all social work, such as air raid shelter, injured rescue, fire fighting preparation, and evacuation of population, increase production in rural areas, investigation and promotion of social undertakings, etc., are all urgent tasks at present, and they are also the practical work of our young people. We hope that under the leadership of the relevant authorities, we will broadly carry out these work.</p>
<p>In the future, we will plan to promote the progress of life and welfare undertakings, and promote a variety of legitimate entertainment activities to enrich the vigorous spirit of the youth and integrate the enthusiastic strength of the youth. We hope that the Shanghai youth will unite under such goals.</p>
<p>Shanghai youth! Facing the active, youthful, and great "May Fourth" Youth Day today, let us hold hands tightly, strengthen our confidence, and expand our bright future, "We must inject new youth blood into the old Chinese body" to defend the survival of the country! To protect the health of the society!</p>
<p>SPORTS</p>
<h3>Talking about the Scenery at the End of the Season - Football</h3>
<p>The football season is coming to an end early, so the late football affairs are particularly late. However, because Shanghai fans are particularly interested in football, the authorities have the heart to make persistent efforts. The most eye-catching football match recently is the Youth Cup football match the other day (3rd). What is in progress and is concerned about is the match between Baima and Qiaolian, and the football invitation league. First, we will comment on the Youth Cup match, and then add a statement to the latter two.</p>
<h3>Youth Cup Qiaolian Defeats Lianyi</h3>
<p>In the Youth Cup football cold, Qiaolian and Lianyi were invited to fight. At a time when there are few wonderful football matches, fans flock to watch, so the situation is not lonely. As a result of the competition, Qiaolian finally defeated Lianyi 2-0 with its good recent performance, avenging the arrow in the football league.</p>
<p>Watching the performance of the two teams this time, there are few ideal results. Because Lianyi has too many adjustments (it has the flavor of basketball substitution), it has a feeling of not being concentrated. And the constant changes of the team members also show that they are out of tune, so how can they have a good performance. Looking at the analysis of Lianyi, they all have the appearance of lack of stamina, so their defeat is appropriate. And the absence of the two major generals Wu Qixiang and Song Lingsheng is a fatal injury. Because Wu was dismissed, Song missed it temporarily due to something, which is really unfortunate. Otherwise, there should be a better performance.</p>
<p>Although Qiaolian won 2-0, in fact, it did not have the past performance. The reason is probably because they are too confident and think that victory can be counted, so they inevitably reveal a little pride. Secondly, it is also a failure to try a new formation. Recently, the lineup of Qiaolian is quite fixed. But this time, the team made changes in the hope of a new attitude. It is difficult to expect results in a hurry. Indeed, the new formation is unfamiliar to each other. It was not until the original state was restored that there was a slight improvement.</p>
<p>In summary, Qiaolian has a point similar to the last Donghua in this session in terms of "qi", it can be seen that the football match has a lot to do with "qi".</p>
<h3>Baima Cup Changed to Welfare Match</h3>
<p>The Baima Cup mentioned in the previous issue of this magazine, submitted to the Football Federation, the authorities have decided to change it to a welfare match. All competitions will be the responsibility of the Football Federation, and the expenses will be borne by Fuhua Tobacco Company. The purpose of this welfare is roughly to donate to the foreign Baojia expenses and the Education Association.</p>
<p>It is found that the Welfare Match has been held seven times in this session. Each time, strong teams are invited to compete, which is very attractive and the harvest is good. Therefore, it has a lot of help to the welfare undertakings of all parties. The benefiting institutions have expressed their infinite gratitude for this, and the players who participated in the competition have also received a lot of comfort from this.</p>
<p>Nai Zhe, the Baima team is based on Donghua, and borrows Song Lingsheng and Li Yichen of Lianyi to form a strong force, which cannot be said. It is agreed that Qiaolian will fight, which has the meaning of challenge, and it should also be a battle that our fans are looking forward to. It is agreed that Yi will have progress and success in ball skills. Then, competing with the soldiers of Baima, the battle process is tense and the ball skills are displayed, which can be expected. Many people say that the meeting between Baima and Qiaolian will be one of the most exciting scenes in this football season.</p>
<p>It is heard that the Baima team has been practicing tirelessly in recent days. The main cadre Cheng Boan and the manager Xu Zhihao are particularly excited. They often discuss and study with the athletes to make a name for themselves at that time. It is reported that this competition has been decided to be held within the next week. The good show is coming, and the fans have a day to appreciate it, and the eye is really not shallow.</p>
<h3>Invitation Football Match is in Progress</h3>
<p>After the completion of the various competitions hosted by the Football Federation, it was decided to hold an invitation football match, which will be organized by the Sansheng Sports Association. The Football Federation originally planned to do it by itself, or because of limited manpower, it is necessary to take a rest at the end of the season, so it entrusted the Sansheng Sports Association to do it. It was originally scheduled to invite six strong Chinese and Western teams. It is now reported that the Sansheng authorities said that for the sake of the venue and time, and in order to achieve the purpose of凑, it is tentatively decided to invite the four strongest teams on the sea to compete in a round robin. The so-called four strong teams will still be half Chinese and half Western. The Chinese team should be Donghua Lianyi. The Western team must be Qiaolian and the Portuguese Chamber of Commerce. However, it is difficult to determine at present whether there will be changes in the team members of each team at that time. (Mei)</p>
<h3>Overview of Pingjin Basketball</h3>
<p>Zhang Xianlun and Quan Changchun, the strong players of the Hualian Pharmaceutical Factory basketball team, went to Pingjin for sightseeing with Fan Qinggong, a famous player in the North, a month ago. They were warmly welcomed by the basketball circles in the North, and they were firmly invited to form a "Hulian" team temporarily to slightly comfort the people there. It can be seen that the fans in the North pay attention to the basketball in Shanghai. Now that Zhang Quan has returned to Shanghai a few days ago, the author has met with him and talked about the simple situation of basketball in the North. I will briefly introduce it next:</p>
<h3>Basketball Interest is Universal</h3>
<p>Pingjin is known as the cradle of basketball in our country. The interest in basketball there is still more than other sports and ball games. All primary schools and middle schools and universities, where there are ball fields, must have a large number of basketball equipment, and the school authorities are also doing their best to promote it. Therefore, basketball can be called the most popular sport in the North.</p>
<h3>Tianjin has More Talents</h3>
<p>In Beijing, the only team that is worthy of being called the strongest is the Beixing team, which once filmed Shanghai. And Tianjin has Yongjin, Jinwei, and Tai Dong three teams, and their strength is above the standard, especially the Tai Dong team is no less than the representative team of Tianjin City. Such famous generals as Liu Xueqi, Wang Hongbin, and Chuan Jinsheng are all in the area. It is found that the results of Beixing and Tianjin teams are not much different, so the standard of the two places is in parallel, and Tianjin has more talents.</p>
<h3>Ball Field is Larger and Slippery</h3>
<p>The ball field in the North that can accommodate a large number of spectators is the outdoor sand and mud field. And most of the important competitions are held outdoors. Its area is slightly larger than the Shanghai Youth Ball Field. It is more vast and boundless to practice in the ball room in Shanghai. The ground is less muddy, and those who are not used to it feel quite slippery and difficult to control. After the speed is fully opened, it is extremely easy to fall down if you try to stop it. As in the most intense and tense time, there is a three-book iron rooster flavor.</p>
<h3>Audience Appreciation Level</h3>
<p>The cheering of the audience when watching the ball is more than that in Shanghai, and it also has the color of the stage. And its appreciation point is more focused on the performing crisp lens. If those who attack with a slow-attack policy, they may not be able to win applause. Is this or the nature of the people in the North?</p>
<h3>Urgently Hope that Shanghai Goes North</h3>
<p>According to this time, only Zhang Quan and two or three others went north, and they have been welcomed by the people there. When Zhang and others returned to Shanghai, the sports circles there entrusted Zhang and others to transfer the Shanghai basketball circles, and eagerly hoped that a purely southern team member could go to Pingjin to compete, to learn from each other, and to comfort the long-standing desire of the Shanghai fans. In fact, the Shanghai basketball team has not yet made a Northern Expedition, which is really regrettable. I don't know if the Shanghai teams can practice it? (Jie)</p>
<h3>Summary of Basketball Theory (18)</h3>
<p>— Liang Zhaoan</p>
<h3>(5) Modern Offensive Method</h3>
<p>There are many kinds of new tactics in modern basketball, and they are changing with each passing day, which cannot be fully described in this book. Generally speaking, before the rules canceled the center circle jump ball, and after the immediate system discussion, the basketball tactics must be attacked across the middle line within ten seconds. Can be roughly divided into two types. Fast attack and five-person joint attack method, delayed attack method. The former is the most popular and extremely popular tactic, while the latter is gradually eliminated due to the limitations of the rules change.</p>
<p>However, the current fast attack and five-person joint attack method have been quite different from the past after years of development, and its name has also has many kinds. In terms of fast attack, there are so-called "fireball" tactics, mixed war, and fierce tactics. In terms of five-person joint attack, there are positional warfare, slow attack, and hub attack method. These tactics are all tactics to break the five-person joint defense. Later, the "man-to-man" defensive method was popular among people. Therefore, there is also a so-called blocking offensive method to break it. Also, since the center circle jump ball was canceled, (in terms of rules, since 1938, the center circle jump ball is limited to the start of the second half and technical fouls.) There is also a tactic called no center circle jump ball. That is, after throwing into blue, throw the ball into the field from outside the end line, and start the competition again, which is a new tactic. From this point of view, it can be seen that the modern basketball offensive method is much more complicated than the defensive method. For the sake of clarity, the general meaning of various offensive methods is specifically described as follows:</p>
<h3>(A) Fast Attack Method</h3>
<p>Although the fast attack method has various tactics such as fierce attack, mixed war, fireball war, and double V-shaped rapid war, its main purpose is the word rapid war. The so-called rapid war is to attack suddenly and fiercely when people are unprepared.</p>
<p>The method of fast attack, in addition to the fixed strategy, such as the double V-shaped rapid war method. Generally speaking, it is to start the attack after guarding the ball, taking advantage of the preparation of the opponent, or when it is too late to retreat. Use the straight-line long-pass ball method to quickly pass it to the companion under blue and throw it in, commonly known as "stealing cold rice". Or use a single gun and a horse, one person pats the ball and rushes forward to throw blue. Or use two people against one, three people against two, and four people against three to attack the opponent, making it impossible to defend and impossible to guard. The method of two people against one is the most effective.</p>
<h3>Volleyball Season to Begin: Introducing Two Outstanding Players, Male and Female</h3>
<p>The volleyball league is being actively organized by the committee. Currently, it is only waiting for the venue to be finalized, and then we will see athletes gallop onto the court. Now, before the curtain rises, this reporter might as well introduce two outstanding talents, male and female, as a prelude.</p>
<p>— Wang Deyuan</p>
<p>Most volleyball athletes who can dominate the era are from Guangdong, which is because volleyball in Guangdong has historical connections. While there are certainly many volleyball players in the South, there are few who have achieved special results. Only this Mr. Wang Deyuan's volleyball skills are of the first class. In the current situation of declining talent in Shanghai, Wang Deyuan can be called a standout among mediocrity. He is now the mainstay of the White team's volleyball team and the sole figure for scoring points. His characteristic is fierce spiking, making it difficult for opponents to retaliate. His saves, blocking, and serving all have unique qualities. Apart from volleyball, Deyuan is not proficient in other sports, which may truly be because he is a gifted volleyball prodigy.</p>
<p>— Chen Meizhen</p>
<p>Miss Chen is the captain of the Three Provinces Women's Volleyball Team. Because of her tall stature, she occupies the central position in the front row, possessing the skill to spike left and kill right at will. I remember six or seven years ago, when Miss Chen represented the Xuanlu Volleyball Team for the first time, her skills shocked the veteran players. At that time, this reporter also felt that she should be a volleyball prodigy. To this day, Miss Chen can still maintain a point-winning spike among female players. However, she has not yet researched blocking and setting techniques. This is why she is always too heavily relied upon for scoring points in the team. Therefore, for Miss Chen to advance further and achieve success, she should study and practice in all aspects.</p>
<p>Apart from volleyball, Miss Chen has few achievements in other sports. Although she is also a member of the Three Young Women's Basketball Team, it is purely a case of filling the ranks. (Lean Person)</p>
