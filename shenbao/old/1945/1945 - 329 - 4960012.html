<h3>張嘉璈蔣經國抵平　即偕接收人員飛長春　國軍推進到達打虎山</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶二日電〕東北行營經濟委員會主任委員張嘉璈，外交特派員蔣經國等一行，二日晨分乘二機飛平，轉長春。</p>
<p>〔中央社北平二日電〕張嘉璈·蔣經國，偕蘇大使館二等秘書齊赫文，二日下午四時半飛抵此，即與東北行營胡秘書長家鳳，及東北各省主席市長等商談，張蔣二氏定四日飛長春，屆時將有一部份財政金融人員返長。張氏語中央社記者，此行係與馬林諾夫斯基元帥會商空運國軍赴東北技術及接收各省行政之手續問題。</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶二日電〕據華方報告，東北國軍沿北寗路推進，今日已開到瀋陽西面一百八十里之打虎山。該處原聞有共軍負嵎。此外並傳，張學良之弟張學詩，已派代表至錦州東北保安司令部接洽投誠。據時報載稱，張學詩部隊已開入瀋陽。</p>
<p>〔合衆社重慶二日電〕據報：國軍第一批地面部隊，業在長春機塲降洛，準備佈置一切，以便國軍由空路開抵長春，惟此訊尚待蹬實。</p>
<p>〔合衆社秦皇島一日電〕共產軍之「諭襲部隊」，於星期五突襲美國陸戰隊司令部西北之煤礦鎭海陽（譯名）據去中國政府官史四名。此一舉一動，乃一週間共軍阻撓國軍向瀋陽推進之最高峯。此外，共軍曾一再破壞石龍（譯音）與鞍山間之鐵路，並不時向防守長城下各車要設置之國軍射擊。共軍竭力使煤礦工人離開煤礦，生產雖略受影響，但煤礦照常工作。</p>
<p>〔聯合社延安二日電〕共軍總司令朱德今日宣稱：中國共產黨從未反對中央軍在東九省各口岸登陸。苟中央軍決定自空中經濟密進駐東九省其他各地，共黨第十八集團軍亦無異議，但「民軍」或是學良舊部在東九省內部有何行動，則共黨不能負責。</p>
<h3>共黨割據稱兵背信棄義　圖分裂中國為二　阻礙各地受降工作進行</h3>
<p>〔路透社重慶二日電〕中宣部吳部長昨單狂接見本社記者談稱：共產黨有使中國分裂為二之企圖，周恩來之言論，（曾於上星期之倫敦「新聞紀事報」發表）乃屬片面之辭，不能與事實對質。當蔣主席於九月二日在渝晤毛澤東時，曾建議改最高國防委員會為各部長之政治會議，毛澤東堅主在召開國民大會以前，共產黨應參加行政院。蔣主席已表示願意考慮，然其後於談判之際，共產黨反不注意及此，而要求有權任命華北諸省主席，並保留獨立軍隊，其意豈非欲使中國分裂為二。此不但與國民利益相違，亦與共黨本身所呼統一中國之口號相衝突。談判之阻碍，即在於此，任何中國政府當不能接受之。當中央準備減軍之際，共黨且圖擴軍，共黨原已同意向中央提出共軍駐防地之計劃，而此項計劃迄未提出，政府一再催促，而葉劍英猶未見來渝合組軍事小組委負會，究其用意，不在採取迤延戰略，即爲意欲食言。周恩來指中央軍於談判進行之際，即首先攻擎，內戰因以發生，但除小接觸外，大規模之戰，饉發生於五處，即山西南部之彰城區。中央軍於八月十九日自日軍手中收復該地，而共產軍於九月二十一日即開始襲擊而予以佔領。河南省北部，中央軍擬往接受日軍投降，爲共軍所襲，將領二人被俘。包頭及歸綏一再爲共軍猛攻，而共產方面之宣傳，竟從未述及此二處之圍城之戰，而周恩來所指各節，旣未言明日期，又未指出地名，可見其信口雌黃。</p>
<h3>魯南共軍猛犯臨城　青島外圍美海外部隊布防　預共軍七團自安陽回竄道口滑縣</h3>
<p>〔中央社魯南某地二日電〕集結魯南之共軍主力，向我臨城國軍猛犯。</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶二日電〕據關係方面接山東來電稱，過膠濟路北竄共軍，在昌邑集結萬餘，準備在掖縣之樂家坪乘船渡往東北。又共軍七千餘，在萊陽强征壯丁萬餘，携帶梯子担架炸藥等，竄至即墨，馬山，靈山等地活動，有攻即墨企圖。</p>
<p>〔聯合社靑島二日電〕美軍已準備在此間孤島及華北各地過冬。現在形勢日益顯明，中央軍雖已在靑島登陸，但山東一時恐難恢復治安。共軍距此不過九十里，膠濟路濰縣又被其佔領。美軍海外部隊第六師，已在靑島外圍及附近飛機塲放哨布防。美式配備中央軍，自上月十四日在此登陸以來，推進不遠，且迄未與共軍接觸。</p>
<p>〔中央社開封二日電〕軍息，共產軍萬餘人計七個師，自安陽回竄滑縣，道口，經過濬縣時，將該縣城垣及南門外衛河上之堅固大石橋及輕便鐵橋均予以澈底破壞，共產軍大部盤據滑縣城南一帶，小部四出騷擾。</p>
<p>共產軍組織鐵路破壞隊</p>
<p>〔中央社天津二日電〕共產軍渤海軍區第一分區司令傳繼澤，近由各幹部中選取優秀人員，組成鐵路破壞隊及鐵路工作隊，分段從事破壞工作中。</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶二日電〕交通部最近接各路局報告，下旬各路遭破壞仍烈，共達七十一處，拆毀路軌，　斷橋梁，焚燒站房，破壞電訊設備，其遭破壞最多者爲膠濟路，次爲津浦路，北寗路，平漢路。已有五十四處修復，餘亦正在極力搶修中。</p>
<p>〔聯合社廣州二日電〕據國軍軍官談稱，廣九鐵路沿綫，時有小股共匪，刧掠各供應站，該路現由最新式配備之第五軍守衛，窺匪徒之意，殆欲牽制廣州地區國軍，不使其開往華北。</p>
<p>共軍以山砲不斷轟包頭</p>
<p>〔中央社綏西一日電〕（一）共軍園困綏包，已閱月矣，兩地被圍人民有四十萬人，凍餓而死者，日有所聞。（二）共軍集結兵力，再度猛擊包頭，廿八·廿九·卅日夜，包頭城東澈夜激戰，迄一日拂曉均未得逞。此次共軍附有由日人所發射之山砲九門，不斷轟擊，平民死傷甚衆。</p>
<h3>政治協商會議　本月十日舉行</h3>
<p>〔聯合社重慶二日電〕政治協商會議一再延期，現聞已定於本月十日，在此間舉行。</p>
<h3>民聯民裕兩輪　明日由京駛滬</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京二日電〕民聯·民裕兩輪，四日午由京駛滬，又長興輪將於三日由漢抵京。</p>
<h3>社論　對評價會的期望</h3>
<p>上海市評價委員會的組織規程，已經市政會議通過了。短時期內當可依法成立。在此物價高昂，民生艱困的時候，當然，我們並不因爲批發物價暫時回平，而忽視了這個新措施。</p>
<p>這個方案，是由社會局提出的。該局所以提出這個方案，想必是由於物價狂　，市府限價政策事實上幾無從貫澈，不得已而採取的一個對策。我們對於這個對策，與其認爲是一種補救，毋奪爲爲是政府對物價政策的一種進步，而且是一種較爲合理的辦法。不過究竟效果如何，此時似乎還不便渦存奢望。</p>
<p>因爲規定評價的方法，側重在同業公會。從常業的立塲，來評定當業的物價，自然可以免去許多　　和障礙，其於應漲應跌的理由，當然也比外界的判斷來得淸楚，斷不會生吞活剝，硬加以種種的限制，使表面上的文章，或者可以交代，而實際上生出許多黑布來，所以我們認爲是一種進步。</p>
<p>但是商家的立塲，總不能不依盈利爲依歸。他們的標準，總逃不出需供這個規律。應該漲時，無從抑之使平；應該跌時，也無從　之使高。所以對於穩定物價，或者抑平物價這個期望，恐怕仍然不會輕易達到。</p>
<p>我國商界上，向來有同業公議的習慣，這個評價方法，並不是新頴的產物。所以施行起來，倒並沒有十分困難。不過我們要知道：往時的同業公議，其目的乃在劃一市似，以免除同業間的競爭，並不含有穩定或抑平的意義在內。</p>
<p>我們如今所以歡迎這個辦法，其意義有三：</p>
<p>（一）評價總是按期的。一經評定，在沒有更改的期間，多少可以收到多少緩和的作用。</p>
<p>（二）除掉這個辦法，只有不談管制。如果談到管制，總免不掉生吞活剝的手段。</p>
<p>（一）戰爭期問，管制物價這件事，所受的痛苦太深了。現在中央已把各項管制物價的法令予以取消，那末，取而代之的方法，除掉蹈襲同業公議的成法，實在也找不出更好的辦法來。</p>
<p>所以我們相當同情於這個新措施。但同時願意再作幾點貢獻：</p>
<p>（甲）參加這個委員會的官廳代表，應相當尊重公正商人的意見，仔細把商情隨時研究，萬不可一味打官話，使商人望而生畏，因而意於合作。</p>
<p>（乙）管制物價，會影響到來源，銷路，與生產，須要從大處落　，竭力避免不必要或不良的後果。</p>
<p>（丙）似如有實地調查的必要，我們以爲還是由商人來担任爲是，不必借手於各式各樣的調查員。</p>
<p>（丁）出席該會的同業代表，應當認淸政府的善意，開誠佈公，坦白合作，期達到穩定物價，安定民生的目的。萬不可心存數衍，偏重一已的盈利。</p>
<h3>馬歇爾來華後　我將提出詳細報告　聞馬氏將轉往倫敦莫斯科</h3>
<p>〔聯合社重慶二日電〕此間消息靈通方面今日宣稱：馬歇爾將軍抵達重慶後，對於中國內爭情形，即可獲得詳細報告。蔣主席與馬歇爾將軍會談時，行政院長宋子文，及外交部長王世杰亦將參加。一般人猜測，馬歇爾將軍並將赴延安一行，俾與共黨領袖毛澤東朱德會晤。</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶一日電〕美國駐華特使馬歇爾將軍抵華時，國民政府將以關於中國時局及國內國外之一切糾紛，作成詳細報告提交馬氏。宋院長，王外長，現正協助蔣主席準備此項報告。此外如軍政部長陳誠，亦將參加與馬氏討論，中國陸軍總司令何應欽上將預料亦將特來重慶參加。至馬氏在中國之行程，是否將訪問延安，與中共領袖會晤，此間頗多猜測。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓一日路透電〕權威而非官方之陸海軍「雜誌」稱：新任駐華特使馬歇爾元帥，除赴中國，尚負有至莫斯科及倫敦之任務。陸軍方而盛傳馬氏所負任務，遠較駐華一事廣泛。彼往重慶或由重慶返美途中，必將在倫敦，或莫斯科稍作勾留，以便討論目前影響三强關係之多種問題。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓二日電〕外交界今日揣測，新任駐華特使馬歇爾，或終將出任美國國務卿。現任國務卿具爾納斯，則將調為駐英大使。同時另一謠傳則謂馬歇爾將被任爲杜魯門總統顧問。另有謠傳，謂杜魯門總統在就任之初，即思將國務院加以改組，惟鑒於最近國務院改組情形，傳對貝爾納斯頗表不滿。總統認爲惟有具有行政經騐，超然於政治及外交黨派之外者，始能負担改組國務院之重任，且須素負衆望，方足以勇敢及公正態度對國務院之行政及人事大事改革。馬歇爾素爲杜魯門總統所倚重，杜魯門既有意將美悔陸空軍合併爲一國防部並施行普遍軍訓，故衆信馬歇爾或將因此繼李希而任總統顧問。預料總統將於作最後決定前，徵求貝爾納斯之個人意見。</p>
<p>〔又電〕據參議員喬治稱：美國新任駐華特使馬歇爾，或將於明日出席珍珠港事件調查委員會，對日軍偸襲珍珠港事有所發表</p>
<h3>赫爾利收集證件　將向外委會報告</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓一日電〕美駐華大使赫爾利辭職後，國會方面已有三委員會，即參院外委會·衆院軍委會·非美國國活動委員會要求赫氏出席報告。美國對華政策，迄今尚未宣明，或將因此次赫爾利辭職事件而獲一答覆，某美國官員稱，馬歇爾將軍除執行美府府所宣布政策外，必將更進一步，探究中國內爭根源，以便提出建議，改變美國對華政策。蘇聯評論家雅柯來夫，今日在莫斯科工黨眞實報中宣稱，「赫爾利嘗爲美國帝國主義分子作喉舌，帝國主義分子希望將美國·亞洲及世界其他部份一併統治」。蘇聯對赫爾利辭職，尚係第一次發表評論。</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約一日合衆電〕紐約郵報專　作家摩維撰文稱，赫爾利於盛怒之下辭職，有一項後果，即促使政府公開申明其支持中國中央政府之政策。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓一日電〕赫爾利刻方準備出席美國會外交委會之調查會，已收集大宗有關前美國國務院親共人員破壞國務院對華政策執行之證明文件，參院外委會主席康納利謂，新聞界可吾出席旁聽是項報告，尚待三日委會全體會員表決後決定。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓二日電〕赫爾利所收集關於前美國務院務親共份子破壞國務院對華政策之證件，其眞實性質如何，其提交參議院外委會前，將暫守秘密。惟聞此項證件，係包含駐華大使與國務院之全部公函在內。印第安拿州共和黨參議員威理斯，在參院發表演說，對美國遠東政策有所批判，並要求國務院「提出解釋而實行大掃除」。</p>
<h3>中國與智利　公使館升格</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶二日電〕據悉中國與智利兩國政府，爲增進邦交，決定將兩國使館升格爲大使館</p>
<h3>葉劍英對外國記者稱　共黨準備作戰十年</h3>
<p>〔聯合社延安二日電〕共軍總參謀長葉劍英今日宣稱，中國共產黨雖切望和平，但仍亦準備作戰十年。共黨即將遣派代表七人赴重慶，出席政治協商會議。中央軍向東九省推進，共用三軍兵力，以二軍作戰，一軍爲預備，總數的九萬人。圍困歸綏之共軍的一萬五千人，城內中央軍人數與此相若。包圍包頭之共軍，則人數較少。</p>
<h3>美助我訓練水兵　俾接替運輸國軍美國船隻　地點設在青島時期三個月</h3>
<p>〔聯合社駐美國第七艦隊特派員自東九省附近海面二日電〕第七艦隊司令馬貝中將，嘗於數星期前建議，凡運辦理中央軍之美國船隻，應由中國水手接替，俾美國水兵可復員回國。巴貝今日復宣稱：在東九省之美國海軍人員，將於本月十日開始訓練中國水手，使用水陸兩用船。訓練地瞇設在青島，訓練時期三個月，第一期受訓人數可達士兵六百名，軍官六十名，此舉用意，乃在養成中國水手，俾便配置於必要船隻，又實行日本投降條款。</p>
<h3>誰在打人？誰在挨打？　傳作義致電郭沫若</h3>
<p>響應反對內戰大會宣言　籲請各界蒞綏一探究竟</p>
<p>〔中央社歸綏一日電〕郭沫若，羅隆基等，十九日在渝召開反對內戰大會，發表宣言，消息傳到此間後，傅作義司令長官深有所感，特以願同聲一呼，反對內戰爲題，致電郭羅等，略謂：反對內戰，頗有同感，中國今天，萬萬打不得，萬萬亂不得，人人憎惡內戰，反對內戰，豈獨諸先生爲然，但戰爭終於在這種反對內戰聲中繼續進行，究竟誰在打誰呢？誰先放內戰的第一槍呢？今作義滿腹苦衷，甚願說明，藉爲反對內戰之一助。作義率領各部隊，從長城抗戰，百靈廟抗戰起，直到日軍投降，整整打了十二年，這無論如何，不能設作義所部沒有抗日，但竟然有人駡我們不抗日，我不明白這是什麽意思？綏遠旣沒有所謂敵人，也沒有科借武器，更不是所謂「解放區」，連共產黨自已，也沒有隻字提及包頭，薩縣，和林等地，但他們的「解放區」，這裏只有抗戰十二年的官兵及受苦八年的同胞，我們的武器亦還只是打了十二年的幾支破槍，但是這裏却成了進攻的目標，成了我們所一致反對的內戰導火綫。我連續退避了幾百里，從豐鎭·集寗·凉城·武川·和林·陶林·一直退避到綏包，而共產軍奔馳千里，述綏包兩個孤城，也被團團圍困，猛攻不已，這就是全國所一致反對的內戰。我願和諸先生同聲來喊「反對內戰」，我並儿熱切盼望，和歡迎諸先生及各黨各派各界人士坐飛機蒞臨綏遠，看一看誰在打內戰，看一看抗戰十二年的軍政人民，正在挨打的慘痛事實。中國人的觀念，向來是同情弱者，但今天誰是弱者呢？弱還能打到綏包城下，打到三邊，打到抗戰根據地的綏西安北？「反對內戰」，「反對內戰」，綏遠軍民流了千萬行眼淚，力竭聲嘶的喊了千萬聲「反對內戰」，他們喊的更　亮，更單純，但是有誰聽見呢？有誰聽見呢？什麼是民主，什麼是人民的意見，不免令吾懷疑了。假如人民有一點表現意見的機會，共產軍還敢打到綏包，打到綏西，安北嗎？諸先生是文化先進，各界領袖，你們的呼喊立刻就廣播了，我聽了該是如何高興，我　複說一遍，請諸先生及各黨各派無黨無派各界人士，迎同共產黨人士，即刻蒞臨綏遠，看一看誰在搶掠，誰在燒殺，誰在姦淫，誰在裏脅，誰在打人，誰在挨打，誰把無辜人民驅上火線送死，將這些事實看明白了，反對內戰才能喊得更有力，更有效。我們抗戰十二年，在勝利之後，被逼到綏包兩個孤城中，挨着死打，呌我們該說什麼呢，謹祝反對內戰成功，諸位先生健康。</p>
<h3>川黔浙陜各省　請中央遏亂萌</h3>

<h3>東北各工廠被人搬空了</h3>
<p>〔聯合社錦州二日電〕據本社攝影記者稱：東九省各工廠於戰事終止後，被搬運一空，渠已實地攝得此項照片。此項情形，自長城迄哈爾濱到處可見。各種工廠均係日人十四年心血結晶，欲圖恢復，非有巨款及苦幹精神不可。</p>
<p>〔又電〕據接收東北某要人稱；就予所見之工廠及醫院，凡外國製造之最重要機件，俱已先初俄人捆載而去。共軍來時復盡取其餘，而將不能携走者破壞無造。農民最後更將所有木料拆除一空。日人曾在錦西建有一大硫酸廠，居世界第四位，今已不能使用。錦西及興縣之汽油廠亦如之。聯合社記者曾駕吉普率駛行四百五十里，至距瀋陽一百五十里地點，僅見一條公路尚堪使用，沿途橋樑已盡遭破壞。</p>

<p>或由前親蘇首相薩爾丹尼繼任</p>
<p>〔路透社德黑蘭二日電〕伊朗總理哈基米今召將向國會演說，發表政府對蘇聯照會之答覆。昨日伊總理巳着德黑蘭市長埃浦達哈傑辭職　而起用親蘇之那里曼。那氏現任郵傳部長。傳蘇方要求更動伊閣員六人及警察官吏，故伊內閣恐不得不事改組。此六人乃內長法希米·參謀長阿爾法·德黑蘭軍事長官莫加登·警務處長薩拉比·內政部安全司長費雅·及德黑蘭市長埃浦達哈傑，此六人均與前伊總理反蘇之丁埃特氏有密切關係。</p>
<p>〔聯合社德黑蘭二日電〕據傳伊朗首相哈基米已準備於本星期提出辭呈，俾退讓賢路於前親蘇首相薩爾丹尼。一般人認爲薩爾丹尼爲合理之繼任人，有以此傳說詢諸伊朗駐英大使者，據稱未有所知，但所傳之繼任人選，固不足爲異。蘇聯照會聲明拒絕伊朗軍隊開往西北之阿茲柏常省，以免釀成流血事件後，哈基米疑於今日予以答覆。</p>
<p>蘇封鎖線　正繼續中</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦二日電〕「世界新聞」德黑蘭特派員稱：被阻之伊朗軍隊，仍集公路兩側，靜待蘇方之允許彼等開入阿日爾貝珍省。蘇方之封鎖綫，已延長及於阿拉森，此封鎖綫背後之情形，正爲各方所關切。英美如再不阻止蘇聯在伊朗之行動，則伊朗內戰，至明春必難避免。所謂民主黨所使用之方法，不外二種，一為要求政府要員如總理外長等之辭職，此事如被拒絕，則將發動軍事政變，一爲由北部舉行選舉，宣布自治，然則伊朗其餘部份，如不赴戰，即不免發生飢荒。若干人深信蘇聯於撤軍前必先佈置暴動，軍隊旣退，當不能再被指爲與暴動　關。聞軍火及高加索之「遊客」大批越阿日爾貝珍邊界而入，目前如派遣公正之調查團調查伊北實况，猶不爲晚，否則恐已不及矣。</p>

<h3>明日的青年敎育</h3>
<p>— 陳伯吹</p>
<p>明日的靑年敎育，應該是怎樣的靑年敎育？</p>
<p>不久的過去，國家的財富，正消費在龐大的軍隊，和軍需上——幾百萬萬元加上幾百萬萬元，是一個令人眩暈的天文學的數字。繼在靑年面前的，是洋洋大觀配備齊整的新式武器，聽到的是空襲警報和轟炸的交響，他們和她們，或者顫慄地衝向戰塲，或者面無人色地躱入防空洞，……食人鬼與怪物已經從童話中現實了。戰爭破壞了整個國家，破產的不僅是經濟，還有智慧和道德，明日的靑年敎育，必須對症發藥。</p>
<p>戰爭過去了，勝利帶來了和平，國家急待建設，靑年應該被敎育在可愛的鄕村，新式的都市，修長的公路鐵道，美麗的河流山脈中引起注意，引起興趣。靑年的愛國服務，從衛國殺敵轉變到驅除蟲害，栽植林本，清潔運動，水利工程，以及一切災難和緊急事變的服務……爲着祖國的建設，爲着一個更好的社會，他們應該被訓練成志願堅定，工作熱忱的人。</p>
<p>靑年必須被訓練去適應新環境，由於空間的緊縮，科學的昌明，世界急劇地作時代的進展，國家因而也不能靜止。靑年面對變動，遭遇變動，要絕不爲變動所震驚，鎭靜地，從容地，鋪砌文明的大道，披荆斬棘邁進。</p>
<p>靑年不僅被訓練去適應新環境，也必須被訓練去創造新環境。而此種訓練，必須减少感情的，多多着重才能的，雖然如此，在三個R以外，還需要第四個R，那就是說，在讀寫算（Reading，Riting，Rithmatic）以外，還要有責任（Responsibility）——在豐富的智識與孰練的技術外，注射道德的維他命。</p>
<p>又，靑年必須被訓練生活在民主主義中，要他們記取這受過血洗的四大自由；並且學習怎樣保衛自由，使用自由，享受自由，以及愛護自由。自由地生活在自由的國家中。</p>
<p>靑年明日即須苦幹，實幹，不容許在今日幻想做夢。完全的靑年敎育，不僅在自然科學方面，也要在社會科學方面，不僅是讀，也要在做；不僅用腦，還要用手。人類從勞動中進化而來，世界終究是屬於勞動者的天地，別忘懷了Learning　by　Doing，尤其在明日的靑年敎育中。</p>

<p>據本市貨物稅周發言人稱：貨物稅係採從價征收制度，先由廠商報價，再經該局根據調查所得之正確市價，予以合理評定。財部對此，並特規定廠盤不得超過市價四分之一，以爲評估貨價之標準。如遇廠盤低於市價四分之一時亦須同樣調整，藉以减輕商民之負担。此項調整辦法，財部規定爲每月一次，各貨應繳稅額，當可不致發生過高過低之現象。又據該發言人透露：該局爲整頓稅收並維護正當商人合法利益起見，對於一般私設之小型捲菸廠，均將會同警方嚴加取締。</p>
<h3>史特拉梅梅耶宣怖　美在華空軍戰績　兩空軍隊員陸續返國</h3>
<p>美駐中國戰區空軍司令史特拉特梅耶將軍今日宣佈，自本月一日起，美空軍司令部大量遣送第十與第十四兩航空隊員回國。此兩航空隊所轄有三個飛行隊，一個運輸隊。並包括空運後勤司令部及空運大隊。以上各機構共有官兵一千六百人。</p>
<p>史將軍並宣佈：此兩航空隊在戰時與戰後所完成之偉大任務，蓋此兩航空隊均爲素具功勳之航空隊，所負工作爲舉世所知。第十四航空隊前在陳納德將軍領導之下，在中國戰區服務三年。第十航空隊則在狄威遜將軍領導下，在印緬戰區工作。第十四航空隊爲有名之飛虎隊，在一九四二年七月在昆明正式成立，與我空軍驅逐頑敵於上空，戰續輝煌，我大後方從此無遭受空襲之憂。雖在供應品不足，及各種困難之下，十四航空隊對日人之威脅至大。前後在空中共毀敵機一二九架，可能毀五八五架。在地面共毀敵機一〇五七架，可能毀二二〇架，即有日機二三四八架被毀，七七八架可能被毀。此時我機只有四六四架被毀。日船隻共二，二七〇，六八九噸被毀，機車三七七九輛被毀，橋樑五七三座，火車一，二四三輛被毀，造成空前紀錄。一九四五年七月，陳納德將軍功成退休第十四航空隊即遷重慶白市驛。今年十月方來滬工作。第十航空隊在狄威遜將軍領導下，一九四二年開始在印緬戰區工作，爲重開中印公路，建造史迪威公路之先驅功臣。其時司令部設印度新德里，後遷加爾各答，鎭守駝峯，使空中運輸不受敵人之偷襲。一九四四年間此航空隊運到緬甸之供應，每日在六十噸以上，今年夏第十航空隊來華工作，戰事結束，即負責軍運，四十九日內運中國軍隊八萬一千人，同時並運輸軍隊五萬人之供應品，現該隊由赫金伯加將眾任司令。第五一三運輸隊，在一九四四年七月至一九四五年九月間，共運乘客二二三，二三二人，供應品四一·〇〇〇噸，其後並在十二日間空運九十四軍全部，自滬至平，所用運輸機C47及46，為今次大戰中之空中運諭權威。</p>
<p>返國美兵即將成行</p>
<p>〔本報專訪〕自十一月二十九日起至十二月十日內，美　　　送　　　　　　　　　　禮及一運輸機返國。此次囘國九工人之資格及理由，種類甚多，但大多係因彼等有高積點者，年齡在三十五或三十八歲以上者，服務軍隊滿四年者，及屬於軍中過剩人員等。此次合格之積點，至少需五十四，所謂積點之獲得，據記者探悉，乃有各種不同辦法。如凡在美國本部軍中服務，而無不良紀錄及不離職者，每月可得一點。凡在國外服務良好者，每月得二點，凡每生一子或女者得十二點，但以三子女爲限（即最多三十六點。）其他如每掛彩一次，或有特殊功績一次者，得五積點。</p>
<p>又聞下月中仍將陸續遷送官兵返美，至一月底，在滬美兵將留六千人。下月可返國者之積點，將降低至最少之五十。但凡屬必要繼任職務之官兵，仍將陸續運滬。</p>

<h3>虹口的日本人　集中生活之一頁</h3>
<p>四年了，沒有去過虹口。這次由重慶回來，聽說日本人都被關在虹口區內，很想去參觀一下那「喪家之犬」的形色。昨日，特地約了幾個朋友，到虹口去留了一趟，可惜不巧得很，適逢凄風苦雨，向來不敢多出來的日本人，在這雨天，更不得不在家躱　了。</p>
<p>虹口的日僑區是包括在北四川路·文路·乍浦路·天潼路·百老匯路·及沿河邊範圍內的地方，日本人祇許在區域以內行走，而不准越境活動。這次再踏進北四川路，心情和神氣都跟四年前大不相同。以前低着頭走路，忽然迎頭　　　　　　的人，　　　　　　　地方去？」那種情形再也沒有了。</p>
<p>乍浦路·百老匯路，昔日熱鬧的塲面，亦已消失。日本商店洋行·妓院全部都被封閉，每個日本人手臂上都套了一條白布，上面寫着「日僑」及某區某保人等字樣。穿着木屐·和服的日本女人依舊很多，還有幾個却打扮得很上等的樣子。崑山路口擺着兩個有帳篷的吃食擁，一個賣湯麵的正在搭篷，準備營業；另一個賣燒饅頭的，則正是大做生意的時候，幾個日本女人和小孩。都在等候熱烘烘的燒饅頭出籠。賣燒饅頭的還會講幾句洋涇浜中國話。所謂燒饅頭者，就是由麵粉鷄蛋打成漿，中夾荳沙，在一個個油煎洞上煎的餅，每只已漲價至三千元僞幣。賣燒饅頭的，一天也可以賺到二三百萬僞幣。問起他回家的事，他大嘆一口氣說，他也不願意回國。寗可在中國擺燒饅頭攤，可是現在祇能等上面命令，什麼時候回去，就得走　我的同伴，特地給我找了個翻譯，和一個日本中年女人商量，到她家去觀光。那女人倒很客氣，連聲說：「小來西，齷齪來西，」我們也連說洋涇浜話：「不要緊。」她的家就在旁邊十幾步路地方，有着一間小房間。雖然擠些，倒也保持得淸潔，鞋子脫在門口。她說他們從前住得很好，現在帶了六個孩子擠在一間裏，吃睡都是席地。丈夫現在以賣舊布爲生。</p>
<p>我們又跑到一條比較高等些的弄堂裹去，找了一位保甲長，保甲長相當年輕，還說幾句洋涇浜英語，告訴我們道，他一個屋子內住了三十多個人，有二十幾家。他們都仍舊付房租及一切費用，但是沒有進款。日本人多數靠着從前的積蓄過活，甩完後就賣舊貨，擺小攤。除了吃食攤外，還有藥品攤笈其他雜貨攤。</p>
<p>最後我們又去以前日本俱樂部舊址，日僑自治會，找到了一位做做務呌古其犬大的。他們正在吃午飯，每個人都有一大碗白飯，上蓋碗蓋，一盒荳腐干燒冬瓜，一小碟鹹菜，一杯茶。古其犬大以不大純粹的英語很誠懇的告訴我們：「說老實話，我願意留在中國工作，我們都喜歡和中國合作，可是現在一切都得等上面命令，何日有船即何日回國，同時爲了妻子兒女都在家鄕，不得不回到老家去。」</p>
<p>據說上海虹口日僑現仍有七萬人。每一里，一坊，平均住七百人，有的甚至住一千人。而多數坊中，或里中，都設一小學校，聘有敎員，敎授本坊或本里內學生讀書。居民都賦閒者多，但大多不願回國。現在日僑自治會內有工作人員一百左右，都不取薪金。他們也很想看看電影，但祇能在虹口區內看看新聞片，報紙僅有第三方面軍辦的一張改造報</p>
<p>我們不願多躭擱古其的吃飯時間，即起立告辭，但古其却非常客氣，還說下次我們如再需要知道詳細情形，他可介紹一位此地合適的人來報告一切。</p>
<p>歸途中，我們都感到一個結論：就是中國人的寬宏大量，及大國民風度，在付時日本人及他們自己的談吐中，即可完全見到了。（邁天）</p>

<h3>天主敎慈善會　歡迎蔡寧總主敎</h3>
<p>羅馬敎宗駐華代表蔡寗總主敎近來滬巡視敎務，上海天主敎慈善事業協助會，昨特茶曾歡迎。到蔡寗總主敎，張伯達，朱志堯，朱孔嘉，薛祖恒，葉秋原，趙爾謙等，首由薛祖恒致歡迎辭，旋由蔡寗總主敎訓導，勗勉有加，聞總主敎在滬尚有旬餘勾留。</p>
<h3>盜匪刧衣殺人</h3>
<p>河南路一三一號榮昌盛百貨號舖主史裕生，年七旬，宜興人，於昨晚六時二十五分許該號突來一顧客，當塲選擇二套衛生衫褲，毛襪二雙，合計法幣二萬一千八百元，乃該顧客忽袖出槍械，携物向北逃逸，舖主史裕生，以血本關係，隨後緊追，當行至天潼路鐵馬路小菜塲景興里弄口，該匪返身拔槍狙擊，適一彈命中史之左太陽穴，當即倒地殞命。該匪則乘機逸去，經西虹口警員據報後，將屍身載送靶子路療養院候報法院勘騐，一面追緝匪犯究辦。</p>
<h3>江海關繼續拍賣　倉庫內易壞物品　一切手續與上次相同</h3>
<p>江海關查點倉庫工作，自執行以來，現經淸查竣事之倉庫，已有九十餘所，現仍積極進行中。倉庫中之易壞物品，今日在海關碼頭有一批拍賣，惟均屬零星，如餅乾·鹹肉·以及上海拍賣留剩之食糖數十包，其拍買手續，完全與上次相同。</p>
<p>海關對於淸查竣事倉庫，除粘貼江海關封條，予以接管外，並派有海關稅警保護。出勤稅警人數，已在二百名以上，是批稅警，亦由美籍常務稅務司聶普樂直接指揮調派。</p>
<p>處理局開送之倉庫總數，計四百七十所，是批倉庫進行查臨時，須由海關直接向原接機構接洽，並派員協助工作。目前查竣之倉庫總數尚不足五分之一，故全部查點竣事，尚需時日。</p>
<h3>平賣布將削價</h3>
<p>據上海區敵偽產業處理局負責人稱：第三批平價布，即將售罄，第四批第五批將接踵由各公司繼續平售。第六批起，布匹花色，將予變換，數量亦將增加，價再格度削减。</p>
<h3>空地限期建屋</h3>
<p>市政府爲救濟屋荒及整飭市等，對於以前遭受戰事被燬房屋，自應加緊建造，以圖復興市面，已飭令地政局擬具「上海市繁盛區域空地限期建築辦法」，會同工務局審查公佈。</p>
<h3>民生公司船隻　分配各綫航程</h3>
<p>民生輪船公司於戰前經營長江航述，成績卓著。戰時則在艱苦環境下，冒險維持大後方水道交通，致遭日機炸沉之船隻，達十餘艘之多，超過現有總噸數以上，損失浩大。</p>
<p>航行船隻</p>
<p>該公司現有大小船隻八十餘艘，但噸位均甚小。其中最大者爲二百餘噸，最小者僅二十餘噸，不及戰時被炸沉失噸位之數。現有航行長江下游之輪隻，有民族·民權·民和·民　·民貴·民來·民蘇·民熙·民憲·民本。民政等十餘艘。後二艘日前在上游失事，正在施救中，尚有民　　　　　　　　　。</p>
<p>航程分配</p>
<p>現有航綫，主要分長江下游（滬宜段），中游（宜渝段），上游（重慶叙府段）三段，及嘉陵江之重慶至合川綫。上游各綫祇宜淺水小輪通航，此外尚有小河航綫，主要爲連絡鐵道及公路交通。</p>
<p>訂購外輪</p>
<p>該公司現正計劃中者，爲訂購新輪，及發展沿海航務，除仍維持長江一帶外，即參加南北洋航綫。前向太古公司購買之沉輪一艘，戰時曾拖駛後方，曾遭敵機轟炸數次，現已拖運來滬，正在江南造船廠修理中，一俟完畢，即可參加沿海航綫。關於訂購新輪，與發展航務有關，日獲得政府之外匯擔保，分別向美國及加拿大訂購新輪，聞數量甚大，對未來航務，指日可期。</p>
<p>撥給船隻</p>
<p>該公司戰時損失慘重，主要船隻，均遭炸燬，故盼政府於接收敵偽之船隻，及碼頭物資中，分配若干部份，以補損失。並希望在滬得以建立一完備之船廠船　。因　　　　　　　　　　　機器廠）設備欠佳，僅能造百噸小輪，主要祇供修理，且無法　立船塢，今後該公司重心移滬，勢必需要規模較大之設備也。</p>

<h3>社會服務　改造社會心理　亟需重振道德</h3>
<p>— 勤生</p>
<p>溯自民國十五六年起，國民黨內混入共產黨後，年輕而無知之黨員，不問眞理，便一味主張拆除聖廟，打倒舊禮敎，以致釀成子欲弒父，弟欲殺兄，生欲減師之惡劣現象。此種惡風，迄未稍減，抗戰以後，便漸漸演成一部分知識階級，以賣國而做偽官者爲榮，非但以死要金錢，爲做僞官之惟一目的；且覦爲應享之權利。是否禍國不問也，是否殃民不顧也，絕無「非禮勿動，以及「義然後取，人不厭其取」之觀念。他若「不義而當儿貴，於我如浮雲」之古訓，更認爲謬說。嘗憶在小學任敎時，全國各校，一致以「禮義廉恥」，爲訓育之目標，但學校敎師以及各級敎育行政人員，絕不以實行爲重。當時雖各以「禮義廉恥」四字，懸諸大衆矚目之處，顧大都認爲裝飾品，至於國父認爲人人應具之道德，如「忠，孝，信，愛，仁，義，和，平」。亦均認爲違反時代之棄物。所以一經日寇侵入之地，奸僞謐起，地方民衆，受奸僞無法無天之荼毒，雖用生花之筆，亦無法描寫其萬一，考其所以至此之因。皆由於一般民衆，道德塗地所致，設今不予重振終將不成社會，前讀寄萍先生所著收復區亟須推行重振道德運動一文，正中下懷，故略舒管見，並以證明重振道德之不可或緩矣。</p>
<h3>改善電車交通</h3>
<p>— 永玉</p>
<p>目前本市公共交通器具，祗有電車一種，又因電車輛數不多，大家均感行路爲艱之慨！余近來每天早上八時左右自靜安寺站乘二路電車至拋球塲，下午八時餘自南京路外灘乘電車至赫德路，自西朝東，愛文義路赫德路原有一站頭，前數天有些電車馳經此站，（當時車內乘客並不多）而不停車，囘憶上一星期日下午一時左右，有十餘輛車，經此而不停，使候車人數愈增愈多，乘車者等候半小時，而不得車乘，耗費寶貴光陰，而誤辦公時間。又下午八時餘，有時自東開西之電車，（車內人並不多）拋球塲站亦不停車，且發現車門未關好而電車已疾馳之事，此事有關市民之安全，至於二路電車聞規定每日外灘晚上最後一次車爲九時開，但常常八時三刻即無電車，而晚上電車之有無，並無表示，使乘客久候而乘不到電車，爲便和全市市民，使職業界解決行的問題，藉以節省寶貴光陰，增進工作效能，實屬必要。我想每晨自西馳東，希望在七時半至十時加放專車，每晚由東囘西，在下午四時半至七時亦加放專車，同時法商電車每晚聞遲至十時進廠，而英商上海電車公司之二路電車，下午九時即止，希望爲便利行旅起見，亦延長一小時至十時爲止。又電車每日行馳時間表即上午何時開始至下午何時爲止，希望在電車中明白公佈，最好晚上若電車均已進廠，在各車站用電燈表明之，俾乘客周知。又爲調劑電車乘客有時擁擠與太空起見，對於每輛電車之距離，及速度，均應隨時加以調整，以上意見，務望電車公司當局深切注意。</p>

<h3>別重慶</h3>
<p>— 趙淸閣</p>
<p>要離開重慶了，反倒有些依依之感，這幾天摒擋就緒，心稍安，三兩窮苦知已，爲我湊集川資，這可撩起我萬端感傷！同時接到九姑來信，勉勵之外，並謂：「附匯萬元，聊表微意，」讀後我不禁伏案痛哭，我憑什麼領此高情？我只能剖心掬誠地告訴她：「萬元之情我拜領了，而萬元之實我仍然退還你，」不是我不需要牠，是我深知她也需要他。我茫然地走了，我也只有茫然地掙扎下去！她曾看見我在八年抗戰的堅苦生活中支持過來，所以她可嚀我依然要保持這種精神，一點不錯，我知道自愛，我更知道尊重愛我的人對於我的期望。我只要活在這世界一天，我就要潔身自愛一天，不辜負父母所給予我的敎養，我也不辜負朋友們的知遇！我無所求於世界，我只願今後自由地，獨立地，端端正正地做一個「人」。</p>
<p>八年來，我沒有得到什麼，但我却在許多戰爭中新認識的朋友裏，到得二三知己，這要算是我最大的收穫了，除此以外，我看見各色各樣的人，各色各樣的事，假如說生活就是學問，那麼對於這八年的學問，我也算略有心得，而且足以敎訓我的後半生，使我懂得今後隨時警惕。</p>
<p>重慶差不多住了七年，七年的歲月是在煎熬，老了許多，外形老我不在乎：精神老，我悲哀！七年以來，我承受着無限深沉的痛苦，爲什麼？爲了抗戰，如今抗戰勝利了，可是我的痛苦依然像毒蛇地縷着我，我不知道什麼時候我才能不再痛苦？什麼時候我才能有眞正快活的一天？</p>
<p>記得我剛到重慶時，是一個多霧的季候；如今離開重慶，又是個多霧的季候，霧，迷矇了我七年！剛來時，懷着興奮的心情，如今離開，却是滿腹懊喪，但願從此衝出霧圈，從此舒暢地呼吸新鮮空氣，和平空氣！</p>
<p>走後，我會不忘重慶的山水，重慶四季常開的花草，我會懷念北碚，北碚供我住過四載的「竹廬」，我會把相思留在大後方的一羣好朋友，我更會時時惦記着文和都都。</p>
<p>都都這幾天特別和我親善，這孩子彷彿懂得人事，他大槪要爲找多增些回憶的辛酸吧？整天不願離開我聲聲不住口呌着「二姨」，一個不滿二十個月的小孩。他的感情居然牽制了我的感情，爲了他，我希望航空公司通知我延期飛行，但是恐怕不可能，二十八號我是一定要走了，我只有希望他早日東下，到春申江邊，我又能抱着他，聽他甜密地一聲聲呌「二姨」「二姨」！</p>
<p>心跳得利害、握管不知所云，就這樣草草結束了重慶生活的一段吧，還有多少值得記憶的人，事，只有留待以後追憶補誌了。</p>
<p>別了，重慶！別了，留在重慶的一羣好朋友，別了文，別了，最親愛的都都。</p>

<h3>揚子江中流的今天</h3>
<p>— 謝冰瑩</p>
<p>我算是從揚子江的上流又回到揚子江的中流了，這著名的三鎭一向是中國中部的首腦；也是中國的心臟，他像百戰沙塲的英雄，擔當過不少偉大的戰役；抗戰，他更負荷過鐵一般的重任，現在，我又看見他的雄姿了，黃鶴樓依然虎視着四週，白鷺洲還是坦白的開展着。我更相信，中國的復興和前進，他要再負更重大的責任！</p>
<p>但是朋友，七的淪陷，使他創傷了，不但在肉體上體是帶着重重的傷痕，即是精神，七年的荼毒，精神他也萎頓頹唐了，最顯著的我到武漢這多天了，不但買不到一本書，而且看不到一本書，這就可以想見了，這幾年武漢的文化生活，太可憐了，人像吃飯造糞的機器，毫無精神生活之可言，自然，「一本書沒有」這話也許過火些，但我相信形式上的書過去是有的，祇是時代轉變，書的主人全把它們藏起來了，其實這些書，有比無更壞，但我又相信，好書的收藏家是有的，祇是太少罷了，甚至收藏的好書，早被敵人收索去了。</p>
<p>現在報紙是有不少家了，新聞有中央社的電報不感缺乏，副刋的稿件却大成問題，本地可以出面的作家旣如鳳毛麟角，要後方寄文章來補充，也千難萬難，我們編副刊的人，大有束手無策之勢，戰時，有「後方勤務部」，不愁沒有彈藥；目前，靑黃不接，我們的「後方勤務部」又在那裏呵！</p>
<p>我希望文化像沙漢似的武漢，能迅速產生水草，道不但希望，而是衷心的祈禱！</p>
<h3>沔縣謁武侯祠</h3>
<p>— 老舍</p>
<p>淡泊於今尚若斯，淸洗疎柏武侯祠，三分未竟賢臣志，一表應憐庸主師！大漢衣冠餘百刧，中原烽火似當時；死而後已同肝瞻，海內飛傳蕩寇旗！</p>
<h3>寫稿</h3>
<p>— 吳仭之</p>
<p>稼軒詞：「少年不識愁滋味。愛上層樓，愛上層樓，爲賦新詞强說愁。而今識盡愁滋味。欲說還休，欲說還休，却道天凉好箇秋。」</p>
<p>這首詞可說是對於淺薄的好賦詞者極盡了諷刺的能事。賦詞固不必愁，但一般的詞總是在說愁，甚至少年之「愛上層樓」者分明無愁而偏欲爲了賦詞，而「强說愁。」的是切中時弊之論。但是「識盡愁滋味」之後，却也何苦「欲說還休」而打個哈哈道是「天凉好箇秋」？中國人的世故總是有些呌人難解。</p>
<p>其實，賦長短句是如此，寫稿也何嘗不是如此。生活得無所感觸而强欲寫稿，自然會難免寫得沒有內容，言之無物。即有，也會難免寫成無病呻吟，言不中有。但是生活得有所惑觸的人，却也大可不必「欲說還休」而打個哈哈說是「今天天氣眞好呀」。除非在鄕村的茶館裏，貼有條子說是「此處莫談國事」的所在。然而現在，不是已經沒有此等的所在了麼？</p>

<p>— 施濟美</p>
<p>燕子去了，牠說牠要回到南方，那溫暖的南方是牠自己的家鄉。</p>
<p>小燕子，我不將你埋怨，因爲誰不愛戀他自己的家鄕？</p>
<p>只是，你爲什麼走得這樣忽忙？等不及欣賞一下這晚節的黃花，看他孤芳自賞。你曾看遍這兒的芍藥，牡丹，蘭桂的芬芳……享受過春花秋月，山溫水妍，你曾有過百千次的洗連。爲什麼？此番就這樣忽忙？</p>
<p>難道你也ｇ　如那庸俗的世人，只能將榮華同享，不能够共度悽凉？</p>
<p>啊！燕子你爲什麼不說話？</p>
<p>暗沉沉的夜，暗沉沉的心，暗沉沉的夢……我夢見他回來，還穿着那去時的衣裳，衣裳上沒有一枚勛章。</p>
<p>我分明記得，他曾是那樣光榮的死在戰塲。難道所有的無名英雄都註定是這個模樣？</p>
<p>於是我稚氣的抱怨了：「你們打仗，你們戰死，原來是爲他人安富尊榮！」</p>
<p>『不許這樣說，』他打斷了我的話，嚴肅的敎訓。「我們是中國的主人翁。」</p>
<p>『但是地面上却沒有一分土地是你們的，』我還有些不平：『你連墳地，或是墓碑都沒有。』</p>
<p>『你知道，我們的墳墓不在地上，在每一個人的心上。』那朗朗的聲音好似響澈了無涯的空間和無限的時間。</p>
<p>我默然，漸漸的恍然了。我們的墳墓不在地上，在每一個人的心上……</p>
<p>筆底春秋</p>
<h3>食之感</h3>
<p>— 汪倜然</p>
<p>飽暖終日的人是不知饑餓爲何物的，此所以富人有非吃補藥無以助消化者，即是因為只患食之太飽，不患食之不足耳。</p>
<p>可是在大動亂的時代中，整個民族為生存獨立而抗戰，整個社會也不得不爲生活持續而奮鬥，這時候物資缺乏，供應艱難，大多數的人遂非節衣縮食不可。這便是戰時生活。不過，節衣尚可，縮食則大難，上海人吃慣了幾大碗白米飯的，到了大米賣兩百萬一擔的時候，實在是難覓一飽。不吃則餓，餓到無法可想的時候，只有隨它什麼苞米粉，麥粞，蠶豆粉，都可以一一下咽了。這種餓的滋味，我想一定有許多人到現在還不曾忘記的。</p>
<p>的確，餓的滋味並不好受，但是久餓之餘，倒也可以養成一種習慣，就是，消化迅速，肚腹輕鬆，更無積滯不化之病，此則竟爲承平飽飫之時所求之而不得者。同時亦可見，『餓死事小，』尚非虛語，欲免爲餓鄕中人，固不必定須失節也。</p>
<p>不過，也正因昔日之欠飽，而痛感今日之過豐。勝利以後，餐館酒肆，讌飲無虛夕，每食可必在萬金以上，這在枯枵已久的人看來，實在是太好太豐盛了。我們不知今日之宏宴座上客，是否都是胃納奇佳者，抑或是枯澀已久，非趕快多進點油水不可？</p>
<p>商業新聞</p>
<h3>一週金融與商業趨勢</h3>
<p>— 重伯</p>
<p>金融　上週本市金融，銀根鬆濫，千元明息每日平定於三角，暗息續由大一角六分退至一角三分，商人漸有重幣輕貨之象。烚赤因傳外滙將自由買買，及國際消息刺激，人心恍惚不定，價在八十萬關口徘徊，以週二，八十二萬元爲最高，週四，七十五萬五千元爲最低，結果以七十七萬七千元收盤，比前週六跌三萬八千元。紋銀每兩穩定於六百五十元，銀幣每枚升至四百六十元，較前週漲三十元，外僑依然零星收進，大約一美票易銀幣三枚弱。美鈔因外滙行將掛牌，進口商及紗廠帮觀望，價由一千三百八十元退至一千三百零八元，比前週跌二十二元。港幣因滬港航運恢復，實力派購進，價老貨站二百二十五元，新貨站七十二元，兩月前本埠擁資者，曾以偽幣一萬元購進新港幣極鉅，迨新港幣作廢露佈，一二日在跌至一千餘元，當時損失慘重，但目前法幣與僞幣換算價，已可大獲其利。</p>
<p>證券　華商證交各經紀人登記就緒，明春將以公債華股外股三大部同時上塲，尤以公債最易部署，統債更爲良好買賣標的，且有將來新洗通貨幣償還空氣，致票面法幣百元之丙種，週四高峯竟見五百八十元，溢價四百八十元之鉅，卒以證券帮多頭獲利了結，回站三百元（甲）至五百二十五元，（丙）較前週尚大漲一百零二元至二百二十五元。華股有得合法地位，廣泛流通說，投機游資重返股市，冷熱門均活躍，大股如永安紗廠價五百四十元，比前週漲一百二十元，小股如景福價三十一元，漲八元五角。外股亦因復業消息，買戶興奮，怡和紗廠漲二百二十元，爲一千六百八十元，整個證券界均因明春正式復業，及內定杜月笙氏爲領袖而呈活潑之象。</p>
<p>貨物　商品方面，因海運恢復，進口船絡繹，麥，棉，油，糖，燒碱，藥品，不斷運滬，市價緩步下降，惟棉紗因冬令內地帮需要，本街門市銷暢，價尚堅定。分析言之，食米因救濟署秈米及糧政當局蕪湖米各有五十萬担運滬消息，粳，秈，糯，米齊跌進一萬元之大關，站七千五百元至九千五百元，比前週續跌五百元至一千元。麵粉傳美麥已到三船，的三十萬石，滬粉廠全部開工，日出麵粉二萬餘包，益以舊金山運來救濟麵粉六萬餘包，價亦疲軟一百五十元，計一號粉三千三百元，二號粉二千九百五十元。雜糧類黃豆，苞米，赤豆，生仁，到銷平靜，各跌一二百元。食油因靑島蚌埠來源絡繹，生油豆汕各跌至二萬一千元，蚌埠貨且小至一萬九千元。糖類因海關將存倉貨拍賣，及興化糖與香港糖陸續運滬，人心呆滯，國產赤白糖站五萬元，舶來赤白糖站六萬元，均比前週跌一萬元。茶葉皖南運來不多，本街與蘇州帮吸胃強，祁門紅茶挺至三萬六千元，烘靑綠茶亦到二萬六千元。紡織品原棉受美棉平疲暗示，大中集美種棉每担一百二十市斤由八萬五千元跌至七萬元，通州花由六萬七千元跌至五萬七千五百元，火機花由四萬五千元跌至四萬一千元，姚花在滬交貨僅四萬二千元，故花業中人有以十一担棉花向紗廠調二十支棉紗一包之物物交換，其實紡紗一包，用原棉四百四十市斤，可見晚近紡織商獲利豐厚，因此華商紗廠全市一百餘萬紗錠半數均在競紡，政府接收敵紗廠，亦已合組中國紡織建設公司，並投資十億元云。棉紗仍在各路客帮搜求，以解戰事停頓多年之冬令渴銷，細紗又漲八萬至十二萬元，粗紗上下一二萬元，採用美棉紡成之四十二支藍鳳老紗售一百三十八萬元，幾於烚赤十兩二大條，須知戰前比率，乃三包紗等於一條金也。棉布倉庫存貨陸續開出，白坯，色布各跌一二千元，十二磅龍頭白細布售二萬八千五百元，經加工染色而成之雛鷄士林布尚售五萬五千元，高及一倍。生絲交易平淡，高廠經每担疲至一百萬元，輯里經小至四十九萬元，人造絲獨因綢廠需求，一百二十號天橋回升至五十七萬元。燃料濱海南北均有到貨，越南鴻基煤首批到滬人心更受衝動，陽泉塊煤每噸價猛跌至三十二萬元，比前週暴跌十萬元，煤球亦跌五百元，尚可燃燒之次貨售一千五百元，柴爿水陸到貨充斥，再跌二三百元，松柴，桑柴，每市担已小至一千四百五十元，火油重行上市，亞細亞僧帽牌每箱約三十斤由一萬五千元小至一萬四千五百元。捲烟　　雖有永泰和派貨，因前週跌落過鉅，反動回漲，五萬枝大英牌升七萬五千元，爲七十二萬五千元。肥皂因平價出售未能滿足市民需要，雖在安南燒碱來滬聲中，仍漲一千元，一百二十塊裝固本牌售一萬五千元，燒碱外洋有到貨，每件三百公斤價步跌至二十八萬元，比前週大跌三十萬元。西藥品外貨可開始定購，奎寗千粒價再跌六千元，爲二萬六千元。白報紙因海軍倉庫存紙開放，每令跌一千元，爲一萬六千五百元，大勢在海運通航後，物價有緩步下降之象。</p>
<h3>戰前後上海之棉紡職業</h3>
<p>— 雪鵬</p>
<p>往昔英日兩國，悉以棉紡織品出口貿易，以奠定其工業之基礎，在一九三五年至一九三九年，日本輸往南菲，印度，南美，南洋羣島等地之棉紡織品，平均每年的值四萬萬美金，現在敵寇屈膝，敵人在華之棉紡織廠，槪已接收，絡續復工，加以台滬韓國等處之棉紡織品，亦正需我國供應，如果我國棉紡織業能代替其地位，則每年出品收益，當更可觀，政府有鑒及此，經制定紡織建設公司章程，劃蘇浙皖三省爲第六區，積極經營，期求開展，惟我國棉紡織業，因採銷便利，交通發達關係，向多集中於通商大埠，尤以上海爲總樞，爰就上海棉紡織業戰前戰後及現在之槪况分述如後。</p>
<p>戰前上海棉紡織廠共有六五家，屬於華商者三一家，日商三〇家，英商四家，計有紗錠二，六六七，〇〇〇枚，線錠四五二，〇〇〇枚，布機三〇，〇〇〇台，以百分比計</p>
<p>紗錠　線錠　布機</p>
<p>華商　四一·七八％　一三·一二％　二九·一二％</p>
<p>日商　四九·九二％　五二·三〇％　五七·五〇％</p>
<p>英商　八·三〇％　二四·五八％　一三·三八％</p>
<p>生產量每月平均出紗七五，八六七件，布一，四二二，九〇〇疋，其中棉紗以華商出產爲最多，棉布以日商出產佔多數，英商最少。</p>
<p>紗　布</p>
<p>華商　五九·五三％　二二·二八％</p>
<p>日商　三六·二七％　七五·〇八％</p>
<p>英商　四·二〇％　二·六四％</p>
<p>抗戰軍興，上海首當其衝，市郊各廠，或遭砲燬，或被迫停工，一二八太平洋戰起，英商四廠槪由敵人沒收，加以敵偽統制綦嚴，原料枯竭，生產一落千丈，三十二年華商各廠棉紗棉布產量，每月平均僅出紗一，九四二件，布二四，八四五疋。</p>
<p>棉紡織廠之棉，向分華棉洋棉二類，洋棉大都由印度美國埃及輸入，華棉經政府之努力改良，戰前總產量曾達一千四百萬担，二十七年依據海關報册，竟有二七三二千担之大量出口，但自二十八年起戰區棉田，大多荒蕪，棉產量因之大减，二十六年蘇浙皖三省，即現在之棉紡，第六區範圍，總計產棉二百八十萬担，其中以江蘇出產爲最多，佔百分之七五，是以自上海各棉紡織廠受敵偽統制或被迫停工後，常熟無錫南通等產棉區，因棉價低廉，棉織昂貴，咸改土紡土織，一部份紡織界，亦向原棉產地籌設小型紗廠，上海市之單純織布廠，手工織布廠，大都亦於此時設立，總計小型紗廠一一五家，紗錠一一五，五三二枚，布廠八〇三家，布機二一，三二四台，每月平均可產棉紗九，〇一二件，布一四，三千疋。</p>
<p>抗戰勝利，大地回春，敵僞經營之棉紡織廠，均由政府接收，積極開工，在戰前日商紗廠共有紗錠一，三二七，六三二枚，綫錠三四七，六〇八枚，羊毛錠四八，〇〇〇枚，苧蔴錠一二，六〇四枚，布機一八，五五三台，經戰爭中之損燬及敵人自動拆毀，損失四分之一，按照十一月廿四日報載接收敵廠已開工者十九家，轉動紗錠一九三千枚，布機三，八七〇台，民營棉紡織廠開工者三〇家，各地小型紗廠以及單純手工布廠，亦紛紛復業，茲將接收敵廠及民營廠紗錠綫錠布機統計列后：</p>
<p>綜觀上表，接收廠亦即目前之國營棉紡織廠與民營廠相較，紗錠布機均以民營佔多數，是以政府如欲取敵人過去棉紡織業地位而代之，以出口收益作奠定發展工業之基石，此區區錠機，頗嫌不足，尚須積極開展，更宜與民營廠通力合作，力予扶植，方可齊步邁進，以底於成。</p>
<h3>市商會召集各業談話</h3>
<p>資本額問題為討論焦點</p>
<p>〔本報特訊〕市商會於二日下午二時召集各同業公會整委會常委，到一百八千二人，市商會常委多數出席，並邀請市黨部市政府警備司令部社會局代表出席指導，對於同業公會加强組織，趕辦會員登記，以及安定物價，協調勞資，冬防治安等問題，均有詳細討論，社會局代表張科長正邦並將當局辦理工商登記之決心，對於登記表中資本一欄，云可由塡報者自由酌量辦理，但經會討論結果，認爲資本之自由酌量塡報，似覺太無標準，最後決定，各業一律暫照二十六年事　前之法幣資本原額塡報，俟現有賬面資本額整理就緒，再行中請更正，先由市商會分呈各主管機關備案，聲明將來課徵所得稅時，其資本額不以此爲標準，聞工商業對於賬面資本額之整理，迄仍未有具體辦法，市商會工商法規委員會正擬分函各同業公會徵求意見，再行詳細檢討，然後方可向政府建議云。</p>

<h3>Zhang Jia'ao and Jiang Jingguo Arrive in Beiping; Immediately Fly to Changchun with Takeover Personnel; National Army Advances to Dahushan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd] Zhang Jia'ao, Director of the Economic Committee of the Northeast Headquarters, and Jiang Jingguo, Special Envoy for Foreign Affairs, along with their entourage, flew to Beiping in two planes this morning and will transfer to Changchun.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 2nd] Zhang Jia'ao and Jiang Jingguo, accompanied by Qi Hewen, Second Secretary of the Soviet Embassy, arrived here by plane at 4:30 PM this afternoon. They immediately discussed matters with Hu Jiafeng, Secretary-General of the Northeast Headquarters, and the chairmen and mayors of various Northeast provinces. Zhang and Jiang are scheduled to fly to Changchun on the 4th, at which time a portion of financial personnel will return to Changchun. Zhang told the Central News Agency reporter that this trip is to confer with Marshal Malinovsky on the technical aspects of airlifting the National Army to the Northeast and the procedures for taking over the administration of the various provinces.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 2nd] According to Chinese reports, the National Army in the Northeast is advancing along the Beining Railway and has reached Dahushan, 180 li west of Shenyang today. It was previously reported that Communist troops were holding out there. In addition, it is rumored that Zhang Xueliang's younger brother, Zhang Xueshi, has sent representatives to the Northeast Security Command in Jinzhou to negotiate surrender. According to the Shih Pao, Zhang Xueshi's troops have entered Shenyang.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 2nd] It is reported that the first batch of ground troops of the National Army have landed at the Changchun Airport, preparing to arrange everything so that the National Army can arrive in Changchun by air. However, this news is still awaiting verification.</p>
<p>[United Press, Qinhuangdao, 1st] The Communist Army's "harassment troops" suddenly attacked Haiyang (transliteration), a coal mining town northwest of the US Marine Corps headquarters, on Friday, according to four Chinese government officials. This action is the peak of the Communist Army's week-long obstruction of the National Army's advance towards Shenyang. In addition, the Communist Army has repeatedly sabotaged the railway between Shilong (transliteration) and Anshan and has frequently fired at the National Army defending various key points under the Great Wall. The Communist Army is making every effort to force coal miners to leave the mines. Although production has been slightly affected, the coal mines are operating as usual.</p>
<p>[United Press, Yan'an, 2nd] Zhu De, Commander-in-Chief of the Communist Army, declared today that the Chinese Communist Party has never opposed the landing of the Central Army at various ports in the Nine Eastern Provinces. If the Central Army decides to move into other parts of the Nine Eastern Provinces by air, the Eighteenth Group Army of the Communist Party will have no objection. However, the Communist Party cannot be responsible for any actions taken by the "People's Army" or former troops of Zhang Xueliang within the Nine Eastern Provinces.</p>
<h3>The Communist Party Seizes Territory, Claims Military Power, Breaks Faith, and Abandons Righteousness; Attempts to Divide China into Two; Obstructs the Progress of Surrender Acceptance Work in Various Places</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Chongqing, 2nd] Minister Wu of the Central Propaganda Department told this agency's reporter yesterday that the Communist Party has the intention of splitting China into two. Zhou Enlai's remarks (published in the London "News Chronicle" last week) are one-sided and cannot be compared with the facts. When Chairman Chiang met with Mao Zedong in Chongqing on September 2, he suggested changing the Supreme National Defense Council into a political conference of various ministers. Mao Zedong insisted that the Communist Party should participate in the Executive Yuan before the convocation of the National Assembly. Chairman Chiang expressed his willingness to consider this. However, during the subsequent negotiations, the Communist Party did not pay attention to this and instead demanded the right to appoint the chairmen of various provinces in North China and to retain an independent army. Is their intention not to divide China into two? This not only violates the interests of the nation but also contradicts the Communist Party's own slogan of unifying China. The obstacle to the negotiations lies in this, which no Chinese government can accept. While the central government is preparing to reduce the military, the Communist Party is attempting to expand it. The Communist Party originally agreed to submit a plan to the central government for the garrison locations of the Communist Army, but this plan has not yet been submitted. The government has repeatedly urged, but Ye Jianying has not yet come to Chongqing to jointly form a military sub-committee. Their intention is either to adopt a delaying tactic or to break their word. Zhou Enlai pointed out that the Central Army launched an attack first while negotiations were underway, causing a civil war to break out. However, apart from small contacts, large-scale battles only occurred in five places, namely, Zhangcheng District in southern Shanxi. The Central Army recovered this area from the Japanese army on August 19, but the Communist Army attacked and occupied it on September 21. In northern Henan Province, the Central Army intended to accept the surrender of the Japanese army but was attacked by the Communist Army, and two generals were captured. Baotou and Guihua have been repeatedly attacked fiercely by the Communist Army, but the Communist propaganda has never mentioned these two siege battles. Zhou Enlai's allegations did not specify dates or locations, showing his recklessness in making false claims.</p>
<h3>Communist Army in Southern Shandong Fiercely Attacks Lincheng; American Overseas Troops Deploy on the Outskirts of Qingdao; Anticipating Seven Regiments of the Communist Army Returning from Anyang to Daokou and Huaxian</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, A Certain Place in Southern Shandong, 2nd] The main force of the Communist Army gathered in southern Shandong is fiercely attacking the National Army in Lincheng.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd] According to reports from Shandong received by relevant parties, over 10,000 Communist troops who fled north across the Jiaoji Railway have gathered in Changyi, preparing to take boats at Lejiaping in Yexian to go to the Northeast. In addition, more than 7,000 Communist troops in Laiyang are forcibly conscripting over 10,000 men, carrying ladders, stretchers, explosives, etc., and are active in Jimo, Mashan, Lingshan, and other places, with the intention of attacking Jimo.</p>
<p>[United Press, Qingdao, 2nd] The US military is prepared to spend the winter on the isolated islands here and in various parts of North China. It is increasingly clear that although the Central Army has landed in Qingdao, it may be difficult to restore order in Shandong in the short term. The Communist Army is only 90 li away from here, and Weixian on the Jiaoji Railway has been occupied by them. The US 6th Overseas Division has been deployed to patrol and defend the outskirts of Qingdao and the nearby airfield. The American-equipped Central Army has not advanced far since landing here on the 14th of last month and has not yet contacted the Communist Army.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 2nd] According to military news, over 10,000 Communist troops, totaling seven divisions, have fled from Anyang to Huaxian and Daokou. When passing through Junxian, they thoroughly destroyed the city walls of the county, the solid stone bridge over the Wei River outside the south gate, and the light railway bridge. The majority of the Communist troops are entrenched in the area south of Huaxian city, and a small number are harassing the surrounding areas.</p>
<p>Communist Army Organizes Railway Demolition Team</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 2nd] Chuan Jize, commander of the first sub-district of the Communist Army's Bohai Military Region, recently selected outstanding personnel from various cadres to form railway demolition teams and railway work teams, engaging in demolition work in sections.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd] The Ministry of Communications recently received reports from various railway bureaus that the destruction of railways in the latter half of the month was still severe, reaching 71 locations. Tracks were torn up, bridges were cut, station buildings were burned, and telecommunications equipment was destroyed. The Jiaoji Railway suffered the most damage, followed by the Jinpu Railway, the Beining Railway, and the Pinghan Railway. Fifty-four locations have been repaired, and efforts are being made to repair the rest.</p>
<p>[United Press, Guangzhou, 2nd] According to National Army officers, small groups of bandits frequently raid supply stations along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway. The road is currently guarded by the newly equipped Fifth Army. The bandits' intention seems to be to contain the National Army in the Guangzhou area, preventing them from heading to North China.</p>
<p>Communist Army Constantly Bombs Baotou with Mountain Guns</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Suiyuan West, 1st] (1) The Communist Army has besieged Suiyuan and Baotou for a month. It is heard daily that 400,000 people besieged in the two places are dying of cold and starvation. (2) The Communist Army has gathered its forces and launched another fierce attack on Baotou. Fierce fighting took place throughout the night of the 28th, 29th, and 30th, without success until dawn on the 1st. This time, the Communist Army had nine mountain guns, launched by the Japanese, which constantly bombarded the city, causing many civilian casualties.</p>
<h3>Political Consultative Conference to be Held on the 10th of this Month</h3>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 2nd] The Political Consultative Conference has been repeatedly postponed and is now rumored to be scheduled to be held here on the 10th of this month.</p>
<h3>Minlian and Minyu Ships to Sail from Nanjing to Shanghai Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] The Minlian and Minyu ships will sail from Nanjing to Shanghai at noon on the 4th. The Changxing ship will arrive in Nanjing from Hankou on the 3rd.</p>
<h3>Editorial: Expectations for the Evaluation Committee</h3>
<p>The organizational regulations of the Shanghai Municipal Evaluation Committee have been approved by the Municipal Council. It should be established according to law in a short period. In this time of high prices and difficult livelihoods, of course, we do not ignore this new measure simply because wholesale prices have temporarily returned to normal.</p>
<p>This plan was proposed by the Bureau of Social Affairs. The reason why the Bureau proposed this plan must be because of soaring prices, and the Municipal Government's price control policy is virtually impossible to implement. Therefore, it had no choice but to adopt this countermeasure. Regarding this countermeasure, we should regard it as a kind of progress in the government's price policy, rather than a remedy, and it is a more reasonable method. However, it seems inappropriate to harbor extravagant hopes for the actual effect at this time.</p>
<p>Because the method of evaluation focuses on trade associations. Evaluating the prices of the industry from the standpoint of the industry can naturally avoid many obstructions and obstacles, and the reasons for price increases and decreases are certainly clearer than external judgments. It will never be a matter of merely forcing restrictions, so that the outward appearance can be justified, while in reality, many dark secrets arise. Therefore, we believe that it is a kind of progress.</p>
<p>However, the position of merchants cannot but be based on profit. Their standard can never escape the law of supply and demand. When prices should rise, there is no way to suppress them to make them level; when prices should fall, there is also no way to hinder them to make them high. Therefore, the expectation of stabilizing prices or suppressing prices will probably not be easily achieved.</p>
<p>In our country's business community, there has always been a habit of trade associations discussing matters. This evaluation method is not a new product. Therefore, implementation is not very difficult. However, we must know that the purpose of past trade association discussions was to standardize the market price to avoid competition between the same trades, and it did not contain the meaning of stabilizing or suppressing prices.</p>
<p>The significance of why we welcome this method now has three aspects:</p>
<p>(1) Evaluation is always periodic. Once evaluated, it can have a certain mitigating effect during the period when there are no changes.</p>
<p>(2) Apart from this method, the only other option is to not talk about control. If we talk about control, we will inevitably resort to forced methods.</p>
<p>(3) During the war, the suffering caused by price controls was too deep. Now the central government has canceled various price control laws and regulations. Then, the method to replace it, apart from following the established law of trade association discussions, cannot find a better method.</p>
<p>Therefore, we are quite sympathetic to this new measure. But at the same time, we are willing to make a few more contributions:</p>
<p>(A) The government representatives participating in this committee should respect the opinions of impartial merchants, carefully study the market situation at any time, and never speak official jargon in a monotonous manner, making merchants afraid and unwilling to cooperate.</p>
<p>(B) Price controls will affect the source, sales, and production, so we must start from the big picture and try to avoid unnecessary or bad consequences.</p>
<p>(C) If there is a need for on-site investigation, we believe that it should still be undertaken by merchants, without resorting to all kinds of investigators.</p>
<p>(D) The trade representatives attending the meeting should recognize the government's good intentions, be open and honest, and cooperate frankly in order to achieve the goals of stabilizing prices and stabilizing people's livelihoods. Never hold back thoughts or give too much attention to personal profits.</p>
<h3>After Marshall Arrives in China, I Will Submit a Detailed Report; It is Said That Marshall Will Transfer to London and Moscow</h3>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 2nd] Well-informed sources here declared today that after General Marshall arrives in Chongqing, he will be able to obtain a detailed report on the situation of the internal conflict in China. When Chairman Chiang meets with General Marshall, Premier of the Executive Yuan Song Ziwen and Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Shijie will also participate. It is generally speculated that General Marshall will also travel to Yan'an to meet with Communist leaders Mao Zedong and Zhu De.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 1st] When US Special Envoy General Marshall arrives in China, the National Government will prepare a detailed report on the Chinese situation and all domestic and foreign disputes to submit to Marshall. Premier Song and Foreign Minister Wang are currently assisting Chairman Chiang in preparing this report. In addition, Minister of Military and Political Affairs Chen Cheng will also participate in discussions with Marshall. General He Yingqin, Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Army, is also expected to come to Chongqing specifically to participate. As for Marshall's itinerary in China, whether he will visit Yan'an and meet with Communist leaders, there is much speculation here.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 1st, Reuters] The authoritative but unofficial "Army and Navy Journal" stated that the newly appointed special envoy to China, Marshal Marshall, is also tasked with missions to Moscow and London in addition to going to China. It is widely rumored in the army that Marshall's mission is far more extensive than the matter of being stationed in China. He will definitely make a brief stay in London or Moscow on his way to Chongqing or back to the United States from Chongqing to discuss the many issues currently affecting the relationship between the three powers.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 2nd] Diplomatic circles are speculating today that the newly appointed special envoy to China, Marshall, may eventually become the US Secretary of State. The current Secretary of State, Byrnes, will be transferred to be the ambassador to the United Kingdom. At the same time, another rumor is that Marshall will be appointed as an advisor to President Truman. Another rumor is that President Truman was considering reorganizing the State Department at the beginning of his term, but in view of the recent reorganization of the State Department, there are reports that he is quite dissatisfied with Byrnes. The President believes that only those with administrative experience, who are independent of political and diplomatic parties, can bear the heavy responsibility of reorganizing the State Department, and must be highly respected in order to reform the administrative and personnel matters of the State Department with a courageous and impartial attitude. Marshall is highly trusted by President Truman. Truman intends to merge the US Navy, Army and Air Force into a Ministry of Defense and implement universal military training. Therefore, many believe that Marshall may succeed Leahy as Presidential Advisor. It is expected that the President will seek Byrnes' personal opinion before making a final decision.</p>

<h3>Hurley Collects Evidence and Will Report to the Foreign Affairs Committee</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 1st] After US Ambassador to China Hurley resigned, three committees in Congress, namely the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the House Military Affairs Committee, and the Committee on Un-American Activities, requested that Hurley attend and report. The United States' policy toward China has not yet been announced and may receive an answer as a result of this Hurley resignation incident. A US official said that General Marshall, in addition to implementing the policy announced by the US government, will further explore the root causes of the internal conflict in China in order to make suggestions and change US policy toward China. Soviet commentator Yakolev declared in the Moscow Workers' Party True News today, "Hurley has acted as a mouthpiece for American imperialists, who hope to rule the United States, Asia, and other parts of the world." This is the Soviet Union's first comment on Hurley's resignation.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 1st, United Press] New York Post columnist Moore wrote that Hurley's resignation in anger has one consequence: it will prompt the government to publicly declare its policy of supporting the central government of China.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 1st] Hurley is currently preparing to attend the US Congressional Foreign Affairs Committee's investigation hearing and has collected a large amount of evidence regarding former pro-Communist personnel in the US State Department sabotaging the implementation of the State Department's policy toward China. Senator Connally, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that whether the press can attend and listen to the report still depends on the vote of all members of the committee in three days.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 2nd] The true nature of the evidence collected by Hurley regarding the pro-Communist elements in the former US State Department who sabotaged the State Department's policy toward China will remain secret until it is submitted to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. However, it is rumored that this evidence includes all the official letters between the ambassador to China and the State Department. Senator Willis, a Republican from Indiana, delivered a speech in the Senate criticizing American Far East policy and demanded that the State Department "provide an explanation and carry out a major cleanup."</p>

<h3>Who is Hitting? Who is Being Hit? Fu Zuoyi Sends a Telegram to Guo Moruo</h3>
<p>Responding to the Declaration of the Anti-Civil War Conference, Calling on All Circles to Visit Suiyuan to Investigate</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Gui Sui, 1st] Guo Moruo, Luo Longji, and others convened an anti-civil war conference in Chongqing on the 19th and issued a declaration. After the news reached here, Commander-in-Chief Fu Zuoyi felt deeply and sent a telegram to Guo Luo and others titled "Willing to Echo Against Civil War," stating: "I deeply sympathize with the opposition to civil war. China today absolutely cannot afford to fight, absolutely cannot afford chaos. Everyone abhors civil war and opposes civil war. Is it only you gentlemen who feel this way? But the war continues amidst these calls against civil war. Who exactly is hitting whom? Who fired the first shot of the civil war? Now I, Zuoyi, have a belly full of grievances and wish to explain, hoping to assist in opposing civil war. I have led troops from the Great Wall Resistance against Japan, the Bailing Temple Resistance against Japan, until the Japanese surrender, for a full twelve years. No matter what, you cannot say that my troops did not resist Japan. But some people scold us for not resisting Japan. I don't understand what this means. Suiyuan has no so-called enemy, nor is it acquiring weapons through conscription, nor is it a so-called 'Liberated Area.' Even the Communist Party itself has not mentioned a word about Baotou, Sazhen, Helin, and other places. But their 'Liberated Area,' here, only has officers and soldiers who have resisted Japan for twelve years and compatriots who have suffered for eight years. Our weapons are still just a few broken guns that have been used for twelve years. But this place has become a target of attack, becoming the fuse of the civil war that we all oppose. I have retreated hundreds of miles continuously, from Fengzhen, Jining, Liangcheng, Wuchuan, Helin, Taolin, all the way back to Suibao, while the Communist army has rushed thousands of miles, besieging the two isolated cities of Suibao and attacking them relentlessly. This is the civil war that the whole country unanimously opposes. I am willing to shout 'Oppose Civil War' with you gentlemen, and I earnestly hope and welcome you gentlemen and people from all parties and factions to come to Suiyuan by plane to see who is fighting the civil war, to see the tragic reality that the military, government, and people who have resisted Japan for twelve years are being beaten. Chinese people have always sympathized with the weak, but who is the weak today? Can the weak still fight to the gates of Suibao, fight to Sanbian, fight to Sui'anbei, the base of the resistance against Japan? 'Oppose Civil War,' 'Oppose Civil War.' The military and civilians of Suiyuan have shed thousands of tears and shouted 'Oppose Civil War' until they are hoarse. They shout louder, more purely, but who hears them? Who hears them? What is democracy? What is the opinion of the people? I cannot help but doubt it. If the people had a little opportunity to express their opinions, would the Communist army dare to fight to Suibao, fight to Suixi, Anbei? You gentlemen are cultural leaders, leaders from all walks of life. Your shouts will be broadcast immediately. How happy I would be to hear that. I repeat once again, please invite you gentlemen and people from all parties, factions, and no factions, including Communist Party members, to come to Suiyuan immediately to see who is looting, who is burning and killing, who is raping, who is coercing, who is hitting people, who is being hit, who is driving innocent people to the front lines to die. After seeing these facts clearly, you can shout against civil war more forcefully and effectively. We resisted Japan for twelve years, and after victory, we are forced into the two isolated cities of Suibao, being beaten to death. What should we say? I wish you success in opposing civil war, and good health to you gentlemen."</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd] Honda Kumataro, the Japanese ambassador to the puppet government in Nanjing from 1940 to 1942, has been included in MacArthur's recently announced new list of those to be arrested.

<h3>Rumor That the Soviet Union Urges Iran to Change Cabinet Members, Iranian Prime Minister Prepares to Resign</h3>
<p>Possibly Succeeded by Former Pro-Soviet Prime Minister Saltaneh</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tehran, 2nd] Iranian Prime Minister Hakimi will speak to Parliament today, issuing the government's response to the Soviet note. Yesterday, the Iranian Prime Minister had Tehran Mayor Aepuda Hajj resign and appointed the pro-Soviet Nariman, who is currently the Minister of Post and Telecommunications. It is rumored that the Soviet side demanded the change of six Iranian cabinet members and police officers, so the Iranian cabinet may have to be reorganized. The six people are Interior Minister Fashimi, Chief of Staff Alpha, Tehran Military Commander Moghadam, Police Chief Sarabi, Director of Internal Security Feya, and Tehran Mayor Aepuda Hajj. These six people are closely related to former Iranian Prime Minister Dindette, who was anti-Soviet.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tehran, 2nd] It is rumored that Iranian Prime Minister Hakimi has prepared to submit his resignation this week to make way for former pro-Soviet Prime Minister Saltaneh. Most people believe that Saltaneh is a reasonable successor. When this rumor was inquired of the Iranian ambassador to the UK, it was said that he was unaware of it, but the rumored successor is not surprising. Hakimi is suspected to respond today to the Soviet note stating that it refused Iranian troops to go to the northwestern province of Azerbaijan to avoid bloodshed.</p>
<p>Soviet Blockade Continues</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 2nd] The Tehran correspondent for "World News" stated: The blocked Iranian troops are still gathered on both sides of the road, waiting for Soviet permission to enter the Azerbaijan province. The Soviet blockade line has been extended to Alasen. The situation behind this blockade line is of concern to all parties. If the UK and the US do not stop the Soviet Union's actions in Iran, then civil war in Iran will be difficult to avoid by next spring. The methods used by the so-called Democratic Party are nothing more than two: one is to demand the resignation of government officials such as the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister. If this is rejected, they will launch a military coup; the other is to hold elections in the north and declare autonomy. Then the rest of Iran will inevitably face famine if it does not go to war. Some people firmly believe that the Soviet Union will arrange riots before withdrawing its troops. Once the troops are withdrawn, they can no longer be accused of being involved in the riots. It is heard that arms and Caucasian "tourists" have crossed the Azerbaijani border in large numbers. It is not too late to send an impartial investigation team to investigate the actual situation in northern Iran, otherwise it may be too late.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tehran, 2nd] Reuters: Iranian forces are reinforcing the capital and have occupied all the key strongholds leading to the capital.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Batavia, 2nd] A spokesperson for the Allied General Headquarters broadcast yesterday, stating: Britain does not wish to wage war on the people of Indonesia to restore Dutch rule, nor does the British army intend to occupy all of Java or remain there for a long period.

We are dealing with national movements within the British Empire in the same way. The immediate prerequisite is to restore law and order throughout Java.

<h3>Minister of Education Zhu Responds to Reporters: Three Current Educational Issues</h3>
<p>Situation of Remedial Classes for Recovered Areas' Universities · Fourth National Education Conference Yet to be Convened · Preparations for the Re-establishment of Peking Normal University</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd] The Ministry of Education held a press conference at 10:00 AM on the 30th, hosted by Minister Zhu Jiahua himself. Reporters raised many questions. According to Minister Zhu's responses, the education repatriation plan had already begun before the end of the war. The current measures for dealing with schools and teachers and students in the recovered areas are based on the resolutions of the National Education Rehabilitation Conference, and formulated with reference to the actual conditions in various places. Three temporary university remedial classes have now been established in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Peiping. The temporary university remedial class planned for Tianjin may be moved to Jinan because there were very few puppet schools in that area in the past. Regarding the Fourth National Education Conference, it is planned to be convened after the repatriation work has come to an end. Regarding the re-establishment of Peking Normal University, the original school was moved to Shaanxi as one of the colleges of the Northwest United University. Later, the Northwest United University was reorganized, and the normal college moved to Lanzhou, renamed Northwest Normal College, and will remain in the Northwest permanently. However, in order to preserve the historical tradition of Peking Normal University, another National Normal College will be established, temporarily re-established at the original site in Peiping. If the school adds three colleges in the future, it can also be renamed a university, and its permanent site will be located in Shijiazhuang, he said.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Province Launches Comprehensive Mandarin Promotion</h3>
<p>Army · Schools · Families · Promote Unanimously</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Taipei City Correspondence] The 319th Regiment of the 107th Division of the National Army stationed in Taiwan, in order to comply with the order to popularize Mandarin, has specially established a Mandarin remedial class at the Showa National School in Showa Town, Taipei City, divided into five groups for instruction.</p>
<p>Organized by the Military Police</p>
<p>The Chinese Mandarin Remedial School organized by the 4th Regiment of the Military Police and the North and South Military Police Teams held an opening ceremony at the end of last month at the Matsugaoka National School in Matsugaoka Town.

<p>School Subjects</p>
<p>[Another Report] The Tungmen Town, Asahi National School, Taihe Town, Taihe National School, and other schools in Taipei City all regard Mandarin as a particularly important subject. All schools that have been taken over and reopened are focusing their attention on promoting Mandarin.</p>

It is said that the education authorities are trying to remedy this.</p>

<h3>Tomorrow's Youth Education</h3>
<p>— Chen Bochui</p>
<p>What should be the youth education of tomorrow?</p>
<p>In the not-so-distant past, the country's wealth was being consumed by a huge army and military needs—millions upon millions of yuan added up to a dizzying astronomical figure. Following in front of the youth were the grand spectacle of well-equipped modern weapons, and what they heard was the symphony of air raid alarms and bombings. They, either trembling, rushed to the battlefield, or, pale-faced, hid in air-raid shelters... The ogre and the monster have already been realized from fairy tales. War has destroyed the entire country, and what has gone bankrupt is not only the economy, but also wisdom and morality. Tomorrow's youth education must be treated accordingly.</p>
<p>The war is over, and victory brings peace. The country is in urgent need of construction, and young people should be educated in the lovely countryside, the modern cities, the long highways and railways, and the beautiful rivers and mountains, drawing attention and arousing interest. The patriotic service of young people has changed from defending the country and killing enemies to eliminating pests, planting forests, cleaning up the environment, water conservancy projects, and all disaster and emergency services... For the sake of the country's construction, for the sake of a better society, they should be trained to be people with firm determination and enthusiastic work.</p>
<p>Young people must be trained to adapt to the new environment. Due to the shrinking space and the prosperity of science, the world is making rapid progress in the times, and the country cannot stand still because of this. Young people face changes, encounter changes, and must never be shocked by changes, calmly and calmly, paving the way for civilization, and advancing through thorns.</p>
<p>Young people are not only trained to adapt to the new environment, but also must be trained to create a new environment. And this kind of training must reduce emotions and focus more on talents. Even so, in addition to the three R's, a fourth R is needed, that is to say, in addition to reading, writing, and arithmetic (Reading, Writing, Arithmetic), there must be responsibility (Responsibility)—in addition to rich knowledge and skilled technology, inject moral vitamins.</p>
<p>Also, young people must be trained to live in democracy, to have them remember these four freedoms that have been blood-washed; and to learn how to defend freedom, use freedom, enjoy freedom, and cherish freedom. Live freely in a free country.</p>
<p>Young people must work hard and do practical work tomorrow, and are not allowed to dream today. Complete youth education is not only in natural sciences, but also in social sciences; it is not only reading, but also doing; it is not only using the brain, but also using the hands. Mankind evolved from labor, and the world will ultimately belong to the world of workers. Don't forget Learning by Doing, especially in tomorrow's youth education.</p>

All charitable organizations in the city applying for permits or registration should follow the procedures and apply to the Social Affairs Bureau. After understanding the details of each charitable organization, the Social Affairs Bureau will provide appropriate guidance and assistance at any time.

Any charitable organization needing assistance should first register with the Social Affairs Bureau to receive relief materials.</p>
<p>Handling Emergency Relief</p>
<p>Subsequently, Deputy Director Ge introduced Zhu Jihou, representative of the Shanghai branch of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, who stated that the city's relief work, before the arrival of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) materials in Shanghai, would focus on emergency relief. Four tasks have been planned: (1) distributing relief materials, (2) organizing work relief programs, (3) accommodating and repatriating refugees returning to the country, and (4) inspecting and assessing the performance of various charitable organizations. The recipients of relief are limited to Chinese citizens, regardless of party affiliation, religion, or ethnicity, and will be treated equally. For careful handling, all charitable organizations applying for assistance must be registered with the Social Affairs Bureau to be eligible. One representative with a good reputation will be selected from each religious organization to be responsible for liaison. A batch of flour has already been distributed, and more bulk materials such as cotton and medicine will arrive in the future.</p>
<p>Discussion of Proposals</p>

The proposal was approved.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Land Registration: Separate Registration Offices Established</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Land Administration Bureau has now established three separate registration offices for various land registrations, each responsible for receiving documents. For applications for ownership registration, transfer registration, change registration, other rights registration, and renewal of title deeds, if the land is located in the old Special District One, Zhabei, or Yinxiang District, applications should be made directly to Registration Office One at 66 Zha Pu Road. If the land is located in the old Special District Two or Fa Hua District, applications should be made directly to Registration Office Two at 71 Daxilu Road. If the land is located in Hunan District or Caojing District, applications should be made directly to Registration Office Three at 72 Shangwen Road. Cancellations, preliminary registrations, and objection registrations should be made to Section Two of the Bureau at Madang Road. Furthermore, due to the significant changes in land rights in recent years and the resulting confusion in land records, a special department has been established to handle land tax collection. For real estate outside the registration districts, any transfer of ownership should be applied for directly to Section Two of the Bureau. The Bureau has also set up an inquiry office to answer questions from businesses regarding registration and tax collection procedures.</p>
<p>Also, it is reported that the Bureau has taken over more than 5,000 mu of public land that was illegally occupied or sold by the enemy and puppet regimes. However, only a little over 1,000 mu are properly documented and can be traced, while the remaining 4,000 mu, despite detailed investigation, are still being concealed by unscrupulous individuals and claimed as private property. Citizens are encouraged to report such cases at any time.</p>
<h3>Goods Tax Collected Ad Valorem: Adjusted Monthly</h3>
<p>According to a spokesperson for the Shanghai Goods Tax Bureau, the goods tax is collected ad valorem, based on the price. Manufacturers first report their prices, which the Bureau then reasonably assesses based on its own market research. The Ministry of Finance has specifically stipulated that the manufacturer's price should not exceed one-fourth of the market price, as a standard for price assessment. If the manufacturer's price is lower than one-fourth of the market price, it should also be adjusted accordingly, in order to reduce the burden on businesses and the public. The Ministry of Finance has stipulated that this adjustment method be implemented monthly, so that the amount of tax payable for each item will not be excessively high or low. The spokesperson also revealed that, in order to rectify tax collection and safeguard the legitimate interests of honest merchants, the Bureau will work with the police to strictly crack down on privately established small cigarette factories.</p>
<h3>Stratemeyer Announces: U.S. Air Force Achievements in China; Air Force Personnel Returning Home in Succession</h3>
<p>General Stratemeyer, Commander of the U.S. Air Force in the China Theater, announced today that, starting from the 1st of this month, the U.S. Air Force Command is extensively repatriating personnel from the Tenth and Fourteenth Air Forces. These two air forces include three flying groups and one transport group, as well as the Air Transport Logistics Command and the Air Transport Group. In total, these organizations comprise 1,600 officers and soldiers.</p>
<p>General Stratemeyer also announced the great tasks completed by these two air forces during and after the war, stating that both air forces are highly decorated and their work is known worldwide. The Fourteenth Air Force, formerly under the leadership of General Chennault, served in the China Theater for three years. The Tenth Air Force, under the leadership of General Davidson, worked in the India-Burma Theater. The Fourteenth Air Force, known as the Flying Tigers, was formally established in Kunming in July 1942 and, together with the Chinese Air Force, drove away stubborn enemies in the sky, achieving brilliant victories, and from then on, our rear areas were no longer threatened by air raids. Despite the shortage of supplies and various difficulties, the Fourteenth Air Force posed a great threat to the Japanese. In the air, they destroyed 1,290 enemy aircraft and possibly destroyed 585. On the ground, they destroyed 1,057 enemy aircraft and possibly destroyed 220, meaning that 2,348 Japanese aircraft were destroyed and 778 were possibly destroyed. At this time, only 464 of our aircraft were destroyed. 2,270,689 tons of Japanese ships were destroyed, 3,779 locomotives were destroyed, 573 bridges were destroyed, and 1,243 trains were destroyed, creating an unprecedented record. In July 1945, General Chennault retired with honors, and the Fourteenth Air Force moved to Baishiyi in Chongqing. They only came to Shanghai to work in October of this year. Under the leadership of General Davidson, the Tenth Air Force began working in the India-Burma Theater in 1942, and was a pioneer in reopening the China-India Highway and building the Stilwell Road. At that time, the command was located in New Delhi, India, and later moved to Calcutta, guarding the "Hump" and ensuring that air transport was not attacked by the enemy. In 1944, this air force transported more than 60 tons of supplies to Burma every day. In the summer of this year, the Tenth Air Force came to China to work, and after the end of the war, it was responsible for military transport, transporting 81,000 Chinese troops in 49 days, while also transporting supplies for 50,000 troops. The team is now commanded by General Hekinberger. The 513th Transport Squadron, between July 1944 and September 1945, transported a total of 223,232 passengers and 41,000 tons of supplies. Later, it also airlifted the entire 94th Army from Shanghai to Ping in 12 days, using C47 and 46 transport aircraft, making it the authority on air transport in this war.</p>
<p>American Soldiers Returning Home Soon</p>
<p>[Special Interview by Our Newspaper] From November 29th to December 10th, the U.S. will send back a gift and a transport plane to the country. The qualifications and reasons for these nine workers returning home are diverse, but most of them are due to their high point accumulation, being over 35 or 38 years old, having served in the military for more than four years, and being surplus personnel in the military. The required point accumulation for this batch is at least 54. According to our reporter's inquiries, the method of obtaining points is varied. For example, serving in the military in the United States mainland without poor records or leaving the job can earn one point per month. Serving well abroad earns two points per month. Having a son or daughter earns twelve points, but limited to three children (i.e., a maximum of 36 points). Other achievements, such as being wounded once, or having special merits once, earn five points.</p>
<p>It is also heard that officers and soldiers will continue to be repatriated to the United States next month, and by the end of January, 6,000 American soldiers will remain in Shanghai. The point accumulation for those returning home next month will be reduced to a minimum of 50. However, officers and soldiers who are necessary to continue their duties will still be transported to Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Most Countries in the World Drive on the Right Side of the Road</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government announced that, according to central government regulations, from New Year's Day next year, all road traffic in the country will switch to driving on the right side of the road. One of the reasons for this is to conform to the trend in most countries.

<h3>A Glimpse of the Japanese in Hongkou Living in Concentration</h3>
<p>It's been four years since I last went to Hongkou. After returning from Chongqing, I heard that all the Japanese were confined within the Hongkou district, and I wanted to see the appearance of these "dogs without homes." Yesterday, I specially invited a few friends to take a trip to Hongkou. Unfortunately, it was a day of bitter wind and rain. The Japanese, who usually don't dare to come out much, were even more likely to be hiding at home on this rainy day.</p>
<p>The Japanese residential area in Hongkou includes the area within North Sichuan Road, Wen Road, Zha Pu Road, Tiantong Road, Broadway Road, and the riverside. Japanese people are only allowed to walk within the area, and are not allowed to cross the boundary. Stepping into North Sichuan Road again this time, my mood and spirit were very different from four years ago. In the past, I used to walk with my head down, and suddenly someone would greet me head-on, asking, "Where are you going, to what place?" That kind of situation is no longer there.</p>
<p>The lively scenes of Zha Pu Road and Broadway Road in the past have also disappeared. Japanese shops, foreign firms, and brothels have all been closed. Every Japanese person has a white cloth band on their arm, with the words "Japanese Resident" and the name of their guarantor. There are still many Japanese women wearing clogs and kimonos, and there are also a few who dress very well. At the intersection of Kunshan Road, there are two food stalls with tents. One selling noodle soup is setting up the tent, preparing to do business; the other selling roasted buns is in the midst of brisk business. Several Japanese women and children are waiting for the hot roasted buns to come out of the oven. The person selling roasted buns can also speak a few words of pidgin Chinese. The so-called roasted bun is made by mixing flour and eggs into a batter, with bean paste in the middle, and frying it in a pan with individual holes. Each bun has already risen in price to 3,000 yuan of puppet currency. The person selling roasted buns can earn two or three million yuan of puppet currency a day. When asked about returning home, he sighed and said that he didn't want to go back either. He would rather set up a roasted bun stall in China, but now he can only wait for orders from above. When the time comes to go back, he has to leave. My companion specially found me a translator, and negotiated with a middle-aged Japanese woman to visit her home. The woman was very polite, repeatedly saying, "Small, dirty," and we also repeatedly said in pidgin Chinese: "It's okay." Her home was just a dozen steps away, with a small room. Although crowded, it was kept clean, and the shoes were taken off at the door. She said that they used to live very well, but now she lives with six children in one room, eating and sleeping on the floor. Her husband now makes a living by selling old cloth.</p>
<p>We then ran to a more upscale alley to find a neighborhood chief. The neighborhood chief was quite young and could even speak a few words of pidgin English. He told us that he had more than 30 people living in one house, with more than 20 families. They still pay rent and all expenses, but have no income. Most of the Japanese rely on their previous savings to get by, and after they are used up, they sell old goods and set up small stalls. In addition to food stalls, there are also medicine stalls and other miscellaneous goods stalls.</p>
<p>Finally, we went to the former Japanese Club and the Japanese Residents Association and found a person in charge named Koki Inuta. They were having lunch. Everyone had a large bowl of white rice, covered with a bowl lid, a box of tofu and winter melon, a small dish of pickles, and a cup of tea. Koki Inuta told us very sincerely in not very pure English: "To be honest, I would like to stay and work in China. We all like to cooperate with China, but now everything has to wait for orders from above. We will return to our home country on whatever day there is a ship, and at the same time, for the sake of my wife and children who are at home, I have to return to my old home."</p>
<p>It is said that there are still 70,000 Japanese residents in Hongkou, Shanghai. Each li (neighborhood) or fang (block) has an average of 700 people, and some even have 1,000 people. Most fang or li have a small school with teachers, teaching students in the fang or li. Most of the residents are unemployed, but most do not want to return home. There are about 100 staff members in the Japanese Residents Association, who do not receive salaries. They also want to watch movies, but they can only watch newsreels in the Hongkou area. The only newspaper available is the Reconstruction Daily, published by the Third War Area Command.</p>
<p>We did not want to delay Koki's mealtime, so we stood up and said goodbye. However, Koki was very polite and said that if we needed to know more details in the future, he could introduce a suitable person here to report everything.</p>
<p>On the way back, we all came to a conclusion: that the generosity and great national spirit of the Chinese people can be fully seen in the conversations of the Japanese people themselves. (Mai Tian)</p>

<h3>Meiyo Maru Arrives Today: Will Carry Japanese Residents to Japan</h3>
<p>The Meiyo Maru, which is carrying our compatriots back to the country, is scheduled to arrive at the Qiujiang Wharf at 9:00 am today. A batch of 2,229 Japanese residents returning to Japan will be concentrated at Hujiang University in Yangshupu before 7:00 am this morning to await inspection. They will board the Meiyo Maru in order at 7:00 am tomorrow morning to return to Japan. The ship is scheduled to leave Qiujiang Wharf tomorrow afternoon.</p>
<h3>Ship Allocation Meeting: Concrete Measures Agreed Upon</h3>
<p>The National Ship Allocation Committee, presided over by the Vice Minister of Communications, held a meeting again yesterday morning at 10:00 am. Concrete measures were drafted regarding (1) the overall ship allocation method, (2) the receiving and returning of ships, and (3) the fuel supply method required for ship navigation.</p>
<h3>Catholic Charities: Welcome Archbishop Cai Ning</h3>
<p>Archbishop Cai Ning, the Papal Representative to China, recently came to Shanghai to inspect religious affairs. The Shanghai Catholic Charities Assistance Association held a tea party yesterday to welcome him. Cai Ning, Zhang Boda, Zhu Zhiyao, Zhu Kongjia, Xue Zuheng, Ye Qiuyuan, Zhao Erqian, and others attended. Xue Zuheng gave a welcome speech, followed by guidance from Archbishop Cai Ning, who offered much encouragement. It is heard that the Archbishop will stay in Shanghai for more than ten days.</p>
<h3>Robbers Kill for Clothes</h3>
<p>Shi Yusheng, the owner of Rongchang Sheng Department Store at 131 Henan Road, was 70 years old and a native of Yixing. At about 6:25 pm yesterday, a customer suddenly came to the store and chose two sets of undershirts and pants and two pairs of woolen socks, totaling 21,800 yuan in legal tender. The customer suddenly pulled out a firearm, took the items, and fled north. Shi Yusheng, the shop owner, chased after him because of the loss of his capital. When he reached the entrance of Jingxing Lane, a small vegetable market on Tiantong Road, the robber turned around and fired a shot, which hit Shi's left temple. He immediately fell to the ground and died. The robber took the opportunity to escape. After receiving the report, the police officers from West Hongkou transported the body to the Bazilu Sanatorium to await a court examination, while tracking down the robber for investigation.</p>
<h3>Jianghai Customs Continues Auction of Perishable Goods in Warehouses; Procedures Same as Last Time</h3>
<p>Since its implementation, the Jianghai Customs' warehouse inspection work has already completed inspections of over ninety warehouses, with active progress continuing. A batch of perishable goods from the warehouses will be auctioned off today at the customs wharf. These are all small items, such as biscuits, salted meat, and dozens of bags of sugar left over from the Shanghai auction. The auction procedures are exactly the same as last time.</p>
<p>The Customs, after completing the inspection of a warehouse, not only affixes Jianghai Customs seals to take it over but also dispatches Customs tax police for protection. The number of tax police on duty has exceeded two hundred. These tax police are directly commanded and dispatched by Mr. Nie Pu Le, the American Chief Secretary of the Customs.</p>
<p>The total number of warehouses sent by the Disposal Bureau is 470. When inspecting these warehouses, the Customs must directly contact the original receiving institutions and send personnel to assist in the work. Currently, the total number of warehouses inspected is still less than one-fifth, so it will take time to complete all inspections.</p>
<h3>Discount on Flat-Priced Cloth</h3>
<p>According to the person in charge of the Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau in the Shanghai District, the third batch of flat-priced cloth is about to be sold out. The fourth and fifth batches will be successively sold at flat prices by various companies. Starting from the sixth batch, the patterns of the cloth will be changed, the quantity will be increased, and the price will be further reduced.</p>
<h3>Deadline for Building on Vacant Land</h3>
<p>In order to alleviate the housing shortage and rectify the city, the Municipal Government believes that houses destroyed in previous wars should be built as soon as possible to restore the city's appearance. It has instructed the Land Administration Bureau to draft "Measures for Limiting the Time for Construction on Vacant Land in Prosperous Areas of Shanghai," to be reviewed and promulgated jointly with the Public Works Bureau.</p>
<h3>Minsheng Company Vessels: Allocation of Routes for Each Line</h3>
<p>Before the war, Minsheng Steamship Company operated on the Yangtze River with remarkable achievements. During the war, it risked maintaining waterway transportation in the rear under difficult circumstances, resulting in more than ten ships being sunk by Japanese aircraft, exceeding its current total tonnage and causing enormous losses.</p>
<p>Sailing Vessels</p>
<p>The company currently has more than eighty ships of various sizes, but their tonnage is very small. The largest is over two hundred tons, and the smallest is only over twenty tons, which is less than the tonnage lost when ships were sunk during the war. The vessels currently sailing on the lower reaches of the Yangtze River include *Minzu*, *Minquan*, *Minhe*, *Min* [missing character], *Mingui*, *Minlai*, *Min Su*, *Minxi*, *Minxian*, *Minben*, and *Minzheng*, a total of over ten ships. The latter two recently had accidents in the upper reaches and are being rescued. There are also *Min* [missing characters].</p>
<p>Route Allocation</p>
<p>The current routes are mainly divided into three sections: the lower reaches of the Yangtze River (Shanghai-Yichang section), the middle reaches (Yichang-Chongqing section), and the upper reaches (Chongqing-Xufu section), as well as the Chongqing-Hechuan line on the Jialing River. The various lines in the upper reaches are only suitable for small, shallow-draft vessels. In addition, there are small river routes, mainly to connect railway and highway transportation.</p>
<p>Ordering Foreign Vessels</p>
<p>The company is currently planning to order new vessels and develop coastal shipping services, in addition to maintaining operations along the Yangtze River. It also plans to participate in the north-south ocean shipping lines. One sunken vessel purchased from Taikoo Company before the war was towed to the rear during the war and bombed by enemy aircraft several times. It has now been towed to Shanghai and is being repaired at the Jiangnan Shipyard. Once completed, it will be able to participate in coastal shipping lines. Regarding ordering new vessels, which is related to the development of shipping services, foreign exchange guarantees are expected to be obtained from the government to order new vessels from the United States and Canada respectively. It is said that the quantity is very large, and the future of shipping services is promising.</p>
<p>Allocation of Vessels</p>
<p>The company suffered heavy losses during the war, and its main vessels were bombed and destroyed. Therefore, it hopes that the government will allocate a portion of the enemy and puppet vessels and dock materials seized to compensate for the losses. It also hopes to establish a complete shipyard in Shanghai. Because [missing characters] (machine factory) equipment is poor, it can only build small ships of one hundred tons, mainly for repairs, and cannot establish a dock. As the company's focus shifts to Shanghai in the future, it will definitely need larger-scale equipment.</p>

<h3>Social Service: Reforming Social Psychology; Urgent Need to Revitalize Morality</h3>
<p>— Qinsheng</p>
<p>Starting from the fifteenth and sixteenth years of the Republic of China, after the Communist Party mixed into the Kuomintang, young and ignorant party members, without questioning the truth, insisted on demolishing temples and overthrowing the old ethics, leading to the terrible phenomenon of sons wanting to kill their fathers and brothers wanting to kill their brothers, and students wanting to insult their teachers. This evil trend has not diminished. After the War of Resistance, it gradually evolved into a situation where some intellectuals took pride in selling out the country and being puppet officials, not only demanding money to the death but also taking it as the sole purpose of being a puppet official, but also considering it a right to be enjoyed. They did not care whether it harmed the country or the people and had no concept of "Do not look at what is contrary to propriety" or "Take only what is right, and people will not resent you for taking it." They even regarded the ancient teaching of "Wealth and honor obtained unrighteously are like floating clouds to me" as nonsense. I remember when I was teaching in elementary school, all schools across the country uniformly used "Propriety, Righteousness, Integrity, and Shame" as the goal of moral education, but school teachers and education administrators at all levels never emphasized its implementation. Although the four characters "Propriety, Righteousness, Integrity, and Shame" were displayed in prominent places, they were mostly regarded as decorations. As for the virtues that Dr. Sun Yat-sen believed everyone should possess, such as "Loyalty, Filial Piety, Faithfulness, Love, Benevolence, Righteousness, Harmony, and Peace," they were also considered outdated and abandoned. Therefore, once the Japanese invaders entered the area, traitors and puppets rose up, and the local people suffered from the unrestrained poison of traitors and puppets. Even the most eloquent pen could not describe even one-tenth of it. The reason for this is that the morality of the general public has been destroyed. If we do not revitalize it now, we will not be able to form a society. I recently read an article by Mr. Jiping, "Areas Recovered Urgently Need to Promote the Movement to Revitalize Morality," which struck a chord with me, so I briefly express my humble opinion to prove that revitalizing morality cannot be delayed.</p>
<h3>Improving Trolley Transportation</h3>
<p>— Yongyu</p>
<p>Currently, the only public transportation in this city is trolleybuses. Because the number of trolleybuses is small, everyone feels that it is difficult to travel! Recently, I have been taking the Route 2 trolleybus from Jing'an Temple Station to the Polo Ground around 8:00 AM every morning and taking the trolleybus from Nanjing Road Bund to Hart Road around 8:00 PM. From west to east, there used to be a stop at the intersection of Avenue Road and Hart Road, but in recent days, some trolleybuses have passed this stop (when there were not many passengers in the car) without stopping. Recalling one Sunday afternoon last week around 1:00 PM, more than ten trolleybuses passed this stop without stopping, causing the number of people waiting for the bus to increase, and passengers waited for half an hour without being able to get on the bus, wasting valuable time and delaying office hours. Also, around 8:00 PM, sometimes trolleybuses heading west from east (with not many people in the car) do not stop at the Polo Ground Station, and it has been found that the car doors are not closed properly while the trolleybus is speeding. This matter is related to the safety of citizens. As for the Route 2 trolleybus, it is said that the last trolleybus from the Bund is scheduled to depart at 9:00 PM every day, but often there is no trolleybus after 8:45 PM, and there is no indication of whether there is a trolleybus in the evening, causing passengers to wait for a long time and not be able to get on the bus. In order to facilitate the travel of all citizens and help the working class solve the problem of transportation, it is necessary to save valuable time and improve work efficiency. I think that from west to east every morning, it is hoped that extra trolleybuses will be added from 7:30 AM to 10:00 AM, and from east to west every evening, extra trolleybuses will also be added from 4:30 PM to 7:00 PM. At the same time, the French Concession trolleybuses reportedly enter the factory as late as 10:00 PM every night, while the English Shanghai Electric Construction Company's Route 2 trolleybuses stop at 9:00 PM. It is hoped that for the convenience of travelers, it will also be extended by one hour to 10:00 PM. Also, the daily trolleybus operating schedule, that is, when it starts in the morning and when it ends in the afternoon, is hoped to be clearly announced in the trolleybus. It is best if all trolleybuses have entered the factory at night, it should be indicated by lights at each station so that passengers are aware. In order to adjust the trolleybus passengers' sometimes crowded and sometimes empty conditions, the distance and speed of each trolleybus should be adjusted at any time. It is hoped that the trolleybus company authorities will pay close attention to the above opinions.</p>

<p>Chun Qiu (Spring and Autumn)</p>
<h3>Farewell, Chongqing</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>I am about to leave Chongqing, and I feel a sense of reluctance. These few days, I have been tidying up, and my heart is slightly at ease. Two or three poor and close friends have gathered travel expenses for me, which stirs up all sorts of feelings in me! At the same time, I received a letter from my Ninth Aunt, who, in addition to encouragement, said, "Attached is ten thousand yuan to express my humble intentions." After reading it, I could not help but weep at my desk. What do I deserve to receive such high regard? I can only tell her wholeheartedly and sincerely: "I accept the kindness of the ten thousand yuan, but I will still return the ten thousand yuan to you." It's not that I don't need it; it's that I know she needs it too. I am walking away aimlessly, and I can only struggle on aimlessly! She has seen me endure the hardships of the eight-year War of Resistance, so she can exhort me to maintain this spirit. That's right, I know how to love myself, and I know how to respect the expectations of those who love me. As long as I live in this world for one day, I will cherish myself for one day and not fail the education my parents gave me, nor will I fail the appreciation of my friends! I ask nothing of the world; I only wish to be a "person" in the future, freely, independently, and uprightly.</p>
<p>In the past eight years, I have not gained anything, but I have gained two or three close friends among the newly acquainted friends in many wars. This must be considered my greatest gain. In addition, I have seen all kinds of people and all kinds of things. If life is learning, then I can be said to have a little understanding of the learning of these eight years, and it is enough to teach me for the rest of my life, so that I understand that I must be vigilant at all times in the future.</p>
<p>I have lived in Chongqing for almost seven years. These seven years have been a torment. I have aged a lot. I don't care about my physical aging; I am saddened by my spiritual aging! In the past seven years, I have endured infinite and profound pain. Why? For the War of Resistance. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, my pain is still winding around me like a poisonous snake. I don't know when I will be able to stop hurting? When will I have a truly happy day?</p>
<p>I remember when I first arrived in Chongqing, it was a foggy season; now, when I leave Chongqing, it is also a foggy season. The fog has blurred my vision for seven years! When I first came, I had a feeling of excitement; now, when I leave, I am filled with regret. I hope to break out of the fog circle from now on and breathe fresh air and peaceful air freely from now on!</p>
<p>After I leave, I will not forget the mountains and rivers of Chongqing, the flowers and plants that bloom all year round in Chongqing. I will miss Beibei, the "Bamboo Hut" in Beibei where I lived for four years. I will leave my longing with a group of good friends in the rear, and I will always think of Wen and Dudu.</p>
<p>Dudu has been especially affectionate with me these past few days. This child seems to understand human affairs. He probably wants me to have more memories of the pain of remembering him? All day long, he doesn't want to leave me, calling out "Second Aunt" repeatedly. He is a child less than twenty months old. His emotions actually restrained my emotions. For him, I hope the airline will notify me to postpone the flight, but I am afraid it is impossible. I must leave on the 28th. I can only hope that he will come east to the banks of the Chun Shen River soon so that I can hug him again and hear him sweetly call "Second Aunt," "Second Aunt!"</p>
<p>My heart is beating so hard that I don't know what to say with the pen. Let's end this passage of life in Chongqing hastily. There are still many people and things worth remembering, but I can only leave them to be recalled and supplemented later.</p>
<p>Farewell, Chongqing! Farewell, a group of good friends left in Chongqing, farewell Wen, farewell, dearest Dudu.</p>
<p>Cultural Communication</p>
<h3>Today on the Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River</h3>
<p>— Xie Bingying</p>
<p>I have returned to the middle reaches of the Yangtze River from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. These famous three towns have always been the head of central China and the heart of China. Like a hero on a battlefield, he has shouldered many great battles; during the War of Resistance, he shouldered an iron-like responsibility. Now, I see his heroic posture again. The Yellow Crane Tower still overlooks the surrounding area, and Egret Island is still openly expanding. I believe even more that China's revival and progress will require him to take on even greater responsibilities!</p>
<p>But friends, seven years of occupation have wounded him. Not only physically, but also with heavy scars. Even spiritually, seven years of poison have made him weakened and decadent. The most obvious thing is that I have been in Wuhan for many days, and I can't buy a book, nor can I see a book. You can imagine that in recent years, the cultural life of Wuhan has been too miserable. People are like machines that eat and make feces, without any spiritual life. Naturally, "no books at all" may be an exaggeration, but I believe that formal books existed in the past, but as times changed, the owners of the books hid them all. In fact, these books are worse than none, but I also believe that there are collectors of good books, but there are too few. Even the good books collected were taken away by the enemy long ago.</p>
<p>Now there are many newspapers, and there is no lack of news from the Central News Agency's telegrams, but the manuscripts for the supplements are a big problem. Local writers who can come forward are as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorns. It is difficult to get articles from the rear to supplement them. Those of us who edit supplements are at a loss. During the war, there was a "rear service department," and there was no worry about ammunition; at present, when things are not connecting smoothly, where is our "rear service department"!</p>
<p>I hope that Wuhan, like a sand dune, can quickly produce water and grass. I not only hope, but also sincerely pray!</p>
<h3>Visiting the Martial Marquis Shrine in Mian County</h3>
<p>— Lao She</p>
<p>Still so detached today,</p>
<p>The Martial Marquis Shrine washed by sparse cypress trees.</p>
<p>Three parts unfinished, the virtuous minister's ambition,</p>
<p>A memorial should pity the mediocre master's teacher!</p>
<p>The Han clothing and crown remain after hundreds of calamities,</p>
<p>The Central Plains' flames of war resemble those of that time;</p>
<p>To exhaust one's life in the same liver and gall,</p>
<p>The banner to quell invaders spreads throughout the country!</p>
<h3>Writing</h3>
<p>— Wu Renzhi</p>
<p>Xin Qiji's poem: "When young, I did not know the taste of sorrow. I loved to climb the tower, I loved to climb the tower, composing new verses to force myself to express sorrow. Now that I have fully known the taste of sorrow, I want to speak but stop, I want to speak but stop, but I say, 'It is a good autumn, the weather is cool.'"</p>
<p>This poem can be said to have satirized shallow and good verse composers to the fullest. Composing verses does not necessarily require sorrow, but general verses are always about sorrow. Even the "climbing the tower" of young people is clearly without sorrow but they just want to compose verses, "forcing themselves to express sorrow." This is a very timely argument. But after "fully knowing the taste of sorrow," why bother to "want to speak but stop" and laugh it off by saying "It is a good autumn, the weather is cool"? The worldliness of Chinese people is always somewhat incomprehensible.</p>
<p>In fact, composing long and short lines is like this, and writing is no different. If you live without any feelings and force yourself to write, you will inevitably write without content and say nothing of substance. Even if you have something to say, you will inevitably write about groaning without illness, and your words will not hit the point. But those who live with feelings may not have to "want to speak but stop" and laugh it off by saying "The weather is really nice today." Unless in a teahouse in the countryside, where there is a sign saying "No discussion of state affairs here." But now, aren't there no such places anymore?</p>
<h3>Swallows [plus one chapter]</h3>
<p>— Shi Jimei</p>
<p>The swallows have gone. It says it wants to return to the South; that warm south is its home.</p>
<p>Little swallow, I will not complain to you, because who doesn't love his own home?</p>
<p>But why did you leave in such a hurry? Couldn't wait to appreciate the late-blooming chrysanthemums and see them appreciating their own beauty. You have seen all the peonies, orchids, and osmanthus flowers here... enjoyed the spring flowers and autumn moon, the warm mountains and beautiful waters, you have had hundreds and thousands of times of washing... Why? Why this time in such a hurry?</p>
<p>Could it be that you are also like those vulgar people, who can only share glory and wealth and cannot share sorrow?</p>
<p>Ah! Swallows, why don't you speak?</p>
<p>Dark night, dark heart, dark dreams... I dreamed he came back, still wearing the clothes he wore when he left, and there was no medal on his clothes.</p>
<p>I clearly remember that he died gloriously on the battlefield. Could it be that all the unnamed heroes are destined to be like this?</p>
<p>So I complained naively: "You fight, you die in battle, it turns out to be for others to live in peace and wealth!"</p>
<p>"Don't say that," he interrupted me and taught me sternly. "We are the masters of China."</p>
<p>"But there is not a single piece of land on the ground that belongs to you," I was still a little upset. "You don't even have a grave or a tombstone."</p>
<p>"You know, our graves are not on the ground, but in the hearts of everyone." That clear voice seemed to resound throughout the endless space and infinite time.</p>
<p>I was silent and gradually realized. Our graves are not on the ground, but in the hearts of everyone...</p>
<p>Chronicles from the Pen</p>
<h3>Feelings About Food</h3>
<p>— Wang Tiran</p>
<p>People who are full and warm all day long do not know what hunger is. This is why rich people have to take tonics to help digestion, because they only suffer from eating too much and not from not eating enough.</p>
<p>But in times of great turmoil, when the entire nation is resisting for survival and independence and the entire society has to struggle to continue living, resources are scarce and supplies are difficult. Most people have no choice but to tighten their belts and reduce expenses. This is wartime life. However, it is still possible to reduce clothing, but reducing food is a major problem. People in Shanghai, who are used to eating several large bowls of white rice, find it difficult to find a full meal when rice sells for two million yuan a picul. If you don't eat, you will be hungry. When you are too hungry to think, you can swallow anything, such as corn flour, wheat grits, or broad bean flour. I think there must be many people who still have not forgotten this taste of hunger.</p>
<p>Indeed, the taste of hunger is not pleasant, but after a long period of hunger, one can develop a habit of rapid digestion, a light abdomen, and no stagnation or indigestion. This is something that cannot be obtained in times of peace and satiety. At the same time, it can also be seen that "It is a small matter to starve to death" is not a false saying. To avoid being among the hungry, it is not necessary to lose integrity.</p>
<p>However, it is precisely because of the lack of fullness in the past that we feel the excess of today. After the victory, restaurants and taverns are filled with banquets every night, and each meal can cost more than ten thousand gold. To those who have been starving for a long time, this is too good and too abundant. We don't know if today's guests at grand banquets all have exceptionally good stomachs, or if they have been withered for too long and must quickly eat more oily food?</p>
<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Weekly Financial and Commercial Trends</h3>
<p>— Chongbo</p>
<p>Finance: Last week in this city, financial markets experienced abundant liquidity. The daily interest rate on one thousand yuan stabilized at three jiao, while the unofficial interest rate continued to decline from one jiao six fen to one jiao three fen. Merchants gradually showed a tendency to favor currency over goods. The price of gold bullion fluctuated erratically due to rumors of free foreign exchange trading and stimulation from international news, hovering around the 800,000 yuan mark. The highest price was 820,000 yuan on Tuesday, and the lowest was 755,000 yuan on Thursday. Ultimately, the market closed at 777,000 yuan, a decrease of 38,000 yuan compared to the previous Saturday. Taels of silver remained stable at 650 yuan each, while silver coins rose to 460 yuan each, an increase of 30 yuan compared to the previous week. Foreigners continued to purchase them in small amounts, with approximately three silver coins being exchanged for slightly less than one U.S. dollar. The price of U.S. dollars declined from 1,380 yuan to 1,308 yuan due to importers and yarn factories taking a wait-and-see attitude in anticipation of the listing of foreign exchange trading. This was a decrease of 22 yuan compared to the previous week. The price of Hong Kong dollars increased because of the resumption of shipping between Shanghai and Hong Kong, with influential parties buying them. Old currency was priced at 225 yuan and new currency at 72 yuan. Two months ago, local investors purchased a large quantity of new Hong Kong dollars with counterfeit currency totaling 10,000 yuan. When the announcement was made that the new Hong Kong currency would be abolished, the price plummeted to over 1,000 yuan on the 1st and 2nd of the month, resulting in significant losses at the time. However, the current exchange rate between legal tender and counterfeit currency allows for substantial profits.</p>
<p>Securities: The registration of various Chinese securities exchange brokers is complete. In the coming spring, public bonds, Chinese stocks, and foreign stocks will be launched simultaneously. Public bonds, especially unified bonds, are the easiest to deploy and are excellent trading targets. Furthermore, there is speculation that new currency will be used to repay them in the future. As a result, Class C bonds with a face value of 100 yuan reached a peak of 580 yuan on Thursday, a premium of 480 yuan. Finally, the securities dealers closed out their long positions with profits, returning to 300 yuan (Class A) to 525 yuan (Class C), still a significant increase of 102 yuan to 225 yuan compared to the previous week. With Chinese stocks gaining legal status and the prospect of widespread circulation, speculative funds returned to the stock market, and both popular and less popular stocks became active. Large stocks, such as Wing On Textile, were priced at 540 yuan, an increase of 120 yuan compared to the previous week, while small stocks, such as King Fook, were priced at 31 yuan, an increase of 8.5 yuan. Foreign stocks were also boosted by news of business resumption, with buyers enthusiastic. Ewo Cotton Mill rose by 220 yuan to 1,680 yuan. The entire securities industry is showing signs of vitality due to the official resumption of business in the coming spring and the internal appointment of Du Yuesheng as its leader.</p>
<p>Goods: Regarding commodities, the market price is gradually decreasing because of the resumption of maritime transport, with ships arriving one after another carrying wheat, cotton, oil, sugar, caustic soda, and pharmaceuticals. However, cotton yarn prices remain firm due to demand from inland buyers during the winter season, with brisk sales in local stores. Analytically speaking, rice prices have fallen by a large margin of 10,000 yuan due to news that the relief agency's indica rice and the grain administration's Wuhu rice, each amounting to 500,000 dan, are being shipped to Shanghai. The prices settled at 7,500 yuan to 9,500 yuan, a further decrease of 500 yuan to 1,000 yuan compared to the previous week. It is rumored that three ships of American wheat, amounting to 300,000 shi, have arrived, and all Shanghai flour mills have resumed operations, producing more than 20,000 bags of flour per day. Additionally, over 60,000 bags of relief flour have been shipped from San Francisco, causing the price to soften by 150 yuan, with No. 1 flour priced at 3,300 yuan and No. 2 flour at 2,950 yuan. The transaction of miscellaneous grains such as soybeans, corn, red beans, and raw peanuts were calm, with each falling by 100 to 200 yuan. Edible oil prices have fallen as supplies from Qingdao and Bengbu arrive continuously, with raw oil and bean oil each falling to 21,000 yuan, and Bengbu goods falling to as little as 19,000 yuan. Sugar prices have stagnated due to the customs auctioning off warehouse stocks, and the successive shipments of Xinghua sugar and Hong Kong sugar to Shanghai. Domestically produced red and white sugar are priced at 50,000 yuan, while imported red and white sugar are priced at 60,000 yuan, each a decrease of 10,000 yuan compared to the previous week. Not much Anhui tea has arrived. Local stores and Suzhou buyers are strongly interested in tea. Keemun black tea has risen to 36,000 yuan, and roasted green tea has also reached 26,000 yuan. The price of raw cotton has fallen due to hints of a weak American cotton market. Large and medium-sized American cotton fell from 85,000 yuan to 70,000 yuan per 120 jin dan, Tongzhou cotton fell from 67,000 yuan to 57,500 yuan, and Huoji cotton fell from 45,000 yuan to 41,000 yuan. Yao cotton for delivery in Shanghai is only 42,000 yuan. Therefore, some people in the cotton industry are bartering 11 dan of cotton for one bale of 20-count cotton yarn from textile factories. In fact, one bale of yarn uses 440 jin of raw cotton, indicating that textile merchants have been making substantial profits recently. As a result, half of the more than one million spindles in Chinese-owned yarn factories across the city are competing to spin yarn. The government has also taken over enemy yarn factories and formed the China Textile Construction Company, with an investment of one billion yuan. Cotton yarn is still being sought by merchants from various regions to satisfy the long-suppressed demand during the winter season after years of war. Fine yarn has risen by another 80,000 to 120,000 yuan, while coarse yarn has fluctuated by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. 42-count Blue Phoenix old yarn spun from American cotton is sold for 1.38 million yuan, almost 10 taels and two big bars of gold. It should be noted that the pre-war ratio was three bales of yarn equal to one bar of gold. Warehouse stocks of cotton cloth are being released successively, with plain cloth and colored cloth each falling by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. 12-pound Dragon Head plain fine cloth sells for 28,500 yuan, while Chuji shirting, which is dyed after processing, still sells for 55,000 yuan, more than double the price. Raw silk transactions are lackluster. High-grade silk has softened to 1 million yuan per dan, while Jili silk has fallen to as little as 490,000 yuan. Rayon alone has rebounded to 570,000 yuan for 120-count Tianqiao brand due to demand from silk factories. Fuel: Goods are arriving from both the north and south coasts. The first batch of Vietnamese Hongji coal arriving in Shanghai has further stimulated sentiment. The price of Yangquan lump coal has plummeted to 320,000 yuan per ton, a sharp drop of 100,000 yuan compared to the previous week. Coal balls have also fallen by 500 yuan, with burnable substandard goods selling for 1,500 yuan. Firewood is arriving in abundance by land and water, falling by another 200 to 300 yuan. Pine and mulberry firewood have fallen to as little as 1,450 yuan per city dan. Kerosene is being relisted. The Asia Asiatic Petroleum's Monk Hat brand is falling from 15,000 yuan to as little as 14,500 yuan per case of approximately 30 jin. Cigarettes: Although Yongtaihe is distributing goods, the price has rebounded due to the significant drop in the previous week. 50,000 Great Britain brand cigarettes have risen by 75,000 yuan to 725,000 yuan. Soap prices have risen by 1,000 yuan despite the news that low-priced sales have not satisfied the needs of the public and that Annan caustic soda is arriving in Shanghai. 120-piece boxes of Gu Ben brand sell for 15,000 yuan. Foreign caustic soda has arrived, with each 300 kg piece gradually falling to 280,000 yuan, a significant drop of 300,000 yuan compared to the previous week. Foreign medicines: Orders can now be placed for foreign goods. Quinine has fallen by another 6,000 yuan per 1,000 pills, to 26,000 yuan. White printing paper has fallen by 1,000 yuan per ream due to the opening of naval warehouse stocks, to 16,500 yuan. Overall, with the resumption of maritime transport, there is a trend of gradual decline in commodity prices.</p>
<h3>The Cotton Spinning Industry in Shanghai Before and After the War</h3>
<p>— Xuepeng</p>
<p>In the past, both Britain and Japan used cotton textile exports to establish their industrial foundations. From 1935 to 1939, the average annual value of Japanese cotton textile exports to South Africa, India, South America, and the South Seas Islands was 400 million U.S. dollars. Now that the enemy has surrendered and the enemy's cotton textile factories in China have been taken over, they are being restarted successively. In addition, cotton textiles from Taiwan, Shanghai, Korea, and other places also need to be supplied by our country. If our country's cotton textile industry can replace its position, then the annual export revenue will be even more considerable. Recognizing this, the government has formulated the Articles of Association of the Textile Construction Company, designating the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui as the Sixth District, and is actively managing them to promote development. However, due to convenient procurement and sales and developed transportation, our country's cotton textile industry has mostly concentrated in commercial ports, especially Shanghai as the central hub. Therefore, the general situation of Shanghai's cotton textile industry before, during, and after the war is described below.</p>
<p>Before the war, there were 65 cotton textile factories in Shanghai, 31 of which belonged to Chinese merchants, 30 to Japanese merchants, and 4 to British merchants. There were 2,667,000 spindles, 452,000 thread spindles, and 30,000 looms. The percentages are as follows:</p>
<p>Spindles Thread Spindles Looms</p>
<p>Chinese Merchants 41.78% 13.12% 29.12%</p>
<p>Japanese Merchants 49.92% 52.30% 57.50%</p>
<p>British Merchants 8.30% 24.58% 13.38%</p>
<p>The average monthly output was 75,867 bales of yarn and 1,422,900 bolts of cloth. Among them, Chinese merchants produced the most cotton yarn, while Japanese merchants produced the most cotton cloth, and British merchants produced the least.</p>
<p>Yarn Cloth</p>
<p>Chinese Merchants 59.53% 22.28%</p>
<p>Japanese Merchants 36.27% 75.08%</p>
<p>British Merchants 4.20% 2.64%</p>
<p>When the War of Resistance broke out, Shanghai was the first to bear the brunt. Factories in the suburbs were either destroyed by artillery fire or forced to stop work. When the January 28th Incident broke out, all four British factories were confiscated by the enemy. In addition, the enemy and puppet regime's control was extremely strict, raw materials were exhausted, and production plummeted. In 1943, the average monthly output of cotton yarn and cotton cloth from Chinese merchants' factories was only 1,942 bales of yarn and 24,845 bolts of cloth.</p>
<p>The cotton used in cotton textile factories is divided into Chinese cotton and foreign cotton. Foreign cotton is mostly imported from India, the United States, and Egypt. Through the government's efforts, the total output of Chinese cotton before the war reached 14 million dan. According to customs reports in 1938, as much as 2,732,000 dan were exported. However, since 1939, most of the cotton fields in the war zone have been abandoned, and cotton production has decreased significantly. In 1937, the total cotton production in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, which is now the area of the Sixth Cotton Spinning District, was 2.8 million dan, of which Jiangsu produced the most, accounting for 75%. Therefore, after the cotton textile factories in Shanghai were controlled or forced to stop work by the enemy and puppet regime, the cotton-producing areas such as Changshu, Wuxi, and Nantong switched to local spinning and weaving due to the low price of cotton and the high price of cotton textiles. Some textile industries also planned to set up small yarn factories in the raw cotton producing areas. Most of the simple weaving factories and handmade weaving factories in Shanghai were also established at this time. In total, there were 115 small yarn factories with 115,532 spindles and 803 cloth factories with 21,324 looms. The average monthly output was 9,012 bales of yarn and 14,300 bolts of cloth.</p>
<p>With the victory of the War of Resistance and the return of spring, the cotton textile factories operated by the enemy and puppet regime were taken over by the government and actively restarted. Before the war, the Japanese yarn factories had a total of 1,327,632 spindles, 347,608 thread spindles, 48,000 wool spindles, 12,604 ramie spindles, and 18,553 looms. Due to war damage and the enemy's voluntary dismantling, one-quarter was lost. According to a report on November 24, 19 enemy factories had been taken over and started operations, with 193,000 spindles and 3,870 looms in operation. 30 privately-owned cotton textile factories have started operations, and small yarn factories and simple handmade cloth factories in various places have also resumed operations. The statistics of the spindles, thread spindles, and looms of the factories taken over and the private factories are listed below:</p>
<p>Looking at the table above, compared with the factories taken over, that is, the current state-owned cotton textile factories, the private factories have more spindles and looms. Therefore, if the government wants to take over the enemy's past position in the cotton textile industry and replace it, using export revenue as the foundation for industrial development, these few spindles and looms are not enough. It is still necessary to actively develop and cooperate with private factories to support them, so that they can move forward together to achieve success.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Convened Discussions with Various Industries</h3>
<p>Capital Issues as a Focus of Discussion</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce convened a meeting of the standing committees of the various industry association reorganization committees at 2:00 PM on the 2nd. 182 people attended, and most of the standing committees of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce were present. Representatives from the Municipal Party Committee, the Municipal Government Garrison Headquarters, and the Bureau of Social Affairs were invited to attend and provide guidance. Detailed discussions were held on issues such as strengthening the organization of industry associations, expediting member registration, stabilizing prices, coordinating labor and management, and winter security. Zhang Kebang, the section chief representing the Bureau of Social Affairs, expressed the authorities' determination to handle industrial and commercial registration. Regarding the capital column in the registration form, he said that those filling out the form could handle it with the freedom to deliberate. However, after discussion at the meeting, it was considered that the freedom to deliberate on the capital seemed too unstandardized. In the end, it was decided that all industries should temporarily fill out the original amount of legal tender capital before the 26th year [1937]. After the current book capital is sorted out, the application for correction will be made. First, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce will submit it to the competent authorities for record, stating that the amount of capital will not be used as a standard when levying income tax in the future. It is heard that there is still no concrete way to sort out the book capital of industry and commerce. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's Industrial and Commercial Laws and Regulations Committee is planning to send letters to various industry associations to solicit opinions, and then conduct a detailed review before making recommendations to the government.</p>
