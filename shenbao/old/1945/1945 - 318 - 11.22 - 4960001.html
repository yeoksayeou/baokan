<h3>國軍迫興城葫蘆島　長城以內抵達各口　平津戒嚴增援部隊續到</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶廿一日電〕國軍三路出關向前推進，進展頗速，未遇抵抗，頃已深入東九省一百八十里，距瀋陽車站的四百里，今晨有關方面稱已迫近北寗鐵路綫上之興城，並謂一二日內即可進抵興城東北五十一里之葫蘆島。</p>
<p>〔本報天津廿一日電〕津市天氣轉寒，冬防已開始，在市區及四郊加强軍警配備，市內組巡察隊，聯合警備，夜間限制通行，津市治安，可絕保無虞。</p>
<p>〔合衆社重慶廿一日電〕政府軍事觀察家今日宣稱：山海關至瀋陽問鐵路共七百五十里，已由國軍佔據者計二百四十里，其餘五百十里，亦不難即予佔領。因北寗鐵路係與遼河平行，中問無險可守。據稱：如國軍抵達瀋陽，將爲中國軍事史上空前未有之事。以前關內軍隊打出關外者，尚無所聞。共軍正繼續在東北集中軍隊，並徵募新兵，其中一部份爲工人及日本士兵。</p>
<p>〔又電〕軍事當局消息，共軍第十六軍區之侵入部隊，仍有阻撓國軍登陸模樣，可能在錦州一帶展開猛烈之戰爭，共軍目標顯在守衛瀋陽之海港。至於長城以內，國軍第九十二，九十四軍，正以平津爲據點，向北進展，其目標在通過河北東北部共軍佔領區，以抵達長城其他各口</p>
<p>〔又電〕國軍一部，已進抵古北口，（北平迤北七十哩），即將與北平取得聯絡，惟自北平、至古北口之鐵路，最近曾遭共軍破壞，天津及唐山國軍部隊，亦正向北進展，直趨喜峯口。</p>
<p>〔聯合社北平廿一日電〕第十一戰區宣布，國軍將繼續開到華北，增援九十二·九十四兩軍。</p>

<h3>別長春</h3>
<p>— 本報記者西鴻</p>
<p>十一月十七日的中午，剛剛在長春機塲降落五分鐘的十架大型運輸機，又忽忽昇起，載着一百九十位心情沉重的東北各省主席，市長，和各部特派員飛返北平，——他們都是奉國府命令接收東北的官員，十月八日以後陸續的從重慶飛來，現在由於東北內外情勢的複雜，接收工作遭遇了重大的困難因而奉政府命暫移北平。這是移轉北平的第一批。在此後二三日內，如果局旁沒有新的重要發展，將續有二百多位東北行營人員移轉北平。代表東北行營留駐下來的，有董副參謀長彥平以次六人組成的軍事代表團，他們將隨着蘇軍總部行動。這次移轉北平的決定，據傳在十四日外交部已通知蘇大使彼得羅夫，十五日東北行營也奉命通知了長春蘇軍總部。</p>
<p>國軍接防東北問題，是一切困難的核心。軍事當局最初進備指定國軍在大連登陸，由於蘇方商港不能供軍事使用的解釋，政府又計劃國軍在營口葫蘆島大東溝登陸，和蘇方約定十一月十日開始，六日接到蘇軍總部通知，上述各地已有八路軍開到，登陸頗不安全。原先準備的空運計劃，也因爲長春附近可以使用的飛機塲只勝了一個，而不易實現。</p>
<p>行政方面：蘇方不久以前曾請各省市長在十二日後分赴各地接收，不過長春市政府的接收，並未包括在內。而在國軍未能迅速大量到達，各地情形並不怎探簡單的情勢下，接收人員都感到無法前往的困難。</p>
<p>經濟方面：值得大書特書的是長春鐵路理事會的成立，和郵電的開始接收。至於東北各大工礦在一塲戰爭之後，即不燬於砲火，設備也需重建。現猶殘留的一部份機器，由於「戰利品」定義的缺乏一致解釋，將來由誰接收？怎樣使用管理？也可能成爲一個困難問題。</p>
<p>因爲這麼多的困難，短期還沒有可以克服的曙光，接收人員無法准成自己的任務，居留長春的意義消失了。所以常局才決定留一個軍事代表團隨駐蘇軍總部，其餘大部人員移轉北平。當十六日東北行營，以政府此項決定通知蘇軍總部後，對方表示歡迎軍事代表團的派駐，對於行營移平不曾表示意見，僅通知第三軍予以協助。</p>
<p>「這是政府當局的，大仃，大智，大勇」！十六日上午十時，張主任嘉璈代替在渝的熊天翼主任，於行營禮堂宣佈了這項重大的命令，最後可囑：「諸位歡歡喜喜的來，還要歡歡喜喜的走去「。但是，台下人們的頭都低下去了。這大下午行營周圍的空氣曾有一度緊張，後來因爲蘇軍帮忙，一切都平靜過去。</p>
<p>十七日早晨，大家沒吃飯便跳上了蘇軍備好的十二輛卡車，附近得了消息的民衆，像從雲端墜跌到深谷，懷疑着不久以前是在做了一個夢。有一位老太婆握着一疉滿鈔，託人帶給他遠在重慶的兒子，還有兩位婦人拉着孩子，鼓起最後的希望，託人帶信給他十四年遠別的丈夫。飛機塲上我們去買早點心時，「你們剛下飛機吧！辛苦了」！賣點心的老漢，還以爲大家剛從重慶來呢！買了一些東西後，老漢悄悄的問</p>
<p>「日本投降啦，怎還不太平哩」？</p>
<p>「咱們軍隊怎還不來哩」？</p>
<p>「再會吧！長春」！十二時十分，飛機徐徐昇起，大家重親了僅一個月左右的淪陷十四年的東北河山慢慢在眼底裏模糊消失了，但是我的心裏並沒有絲毫空虛之感，而是更添了一份沉重的心情。橫在銀翼前面的是一片渺無涯際捲起千堆雪的雲海，有些峭拔的山峯在這雲海上露出了它的面目，但是也有些看不見的巉巖就埋在這隔膜了晴空與大地的雲海的下面，任何一個飛機在這上面航行，都會茫茫不知所從，或者冒失的撞碎在雲海裏的礁石上，人類的智慧可以製造原子彈，飛彈，無綫　　X光，爲什麼不能產生一股智慧的風，把這些雲墾吹散呢？這時我又再度的想起了一禮拜以前一位具有遠見的政治家的談話：「盟國在東北所表現的關係發展，勢將影饗太平洋沿岸國家以至全世界人類的命運」，現在無論那一條約命運的船，都在剛從一個殘酷的戰爭的血海裏划出，彼此都應該多麼小心，不要划進另一個血海裏啊！　（十一月十九日寄自北平）</p>
<h3>豫省共軍繼續犯　傾全力破壞華北鐵路橋梁</h3>
<p>〔中央社開封二十日電〕豫省軍事當局，頃得各方電告，共軍動態如下：（甲）豫北（一）共軍在冀南，磁縣集中十萬餘人，揚言將進犯安陽縣城。（二）安陽北之豐樂地車站建築物，被共軍鼓動暴民全部破壞。（三）共軍在安陽各區村鎭，仍征公糧棉花粗布子彈，並搜集担架，企圖向我國軍進犯。（乙）豫南十六日晚共軍三千餘人，攻陷羅山南鄕潘新店，當地警備部副團長陳仲卿下落不明。（丙）豫東（一）民權屬吳岳劉口一帶，於十六日午後，發現共軍六千餘名，有竄犯商邱企圖。（二）考城束之張一樓一帶，有共軍張連三部五六百人，焚燬縣長張盛泰住宅。距該縣城東四十里之黃莊，有共軍千餘企圖進犯東明。</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶二十一日〕交通界息：北方破壞交通情事，近仍層出不窮。據各方面電報觀察，共軍破壞交通，近似有集中全力，炸毀各鐵路重要橋樑之趨勢。就最近一句統計，北方各路橋樑之被炸毀者，達十六處之多，計津浦路兩處，平漢路四處，北寗路五處，膠濟路兩處，正太隴海及平古等三路各一處。</p>

<h3>招商局試辦　津靑間航綫</h3>
<p>〔本報天津二十一日專電〕津航政局督導招商局，先試辦天津靑島綫，俟滬調來巨輪後，恢復津滬航綫，至天津與塘沽間，短期內可通航，天津與秦皇島，一時亦尚難實現。</p>
<h3>港渝滬粵空運　今日正式開始</h3>
<p>〔路透社香港二十一日電〕港渝及粤滬間航空運輸，可於明日正式開始。</p>
<h3>為挽救東北危局事　傳我向蘇提建議</h3>
<p>東北行營結束人員多撤回</p>
<p>〔合衆社十一月廿一日重慶電〕據可靠消息、關於中蘇協議改進東北局勢事，中國當局已向蘇聯駐華大使彼得洛夫提出建議，轉致莫斯科。蘇聯仍應允中國政府利用北滿機塲，惟此項讓步並無實際價值，蓋技術上之限制，實無法使我空運順利進行也。</p>
<p>〔路透社重慶廿一日電〕國共雙方軍事衝突，目前主要爭點，厥在控制東北政權。蘇聯當局對雙方武裝衝突，正予密切注意。據重慶傳來未證實消息，中蘇談判將於最近期內開始舉行討論，解決東北糾紛。上月十三日東北行營主任熊式輝，與蘇聯某管員，在長春進行談判，商討依據中蘇友好條約，由國軍進駐東北問題。傳會談時空氣極融洽，但至十月廿五日，蘇聯態度突趨强硬，而共軍亦同時開始侵入東北。記者今年六月，曾獲睹共軍秘密軍事地圖一幅，其上載有共軍實力及分佈情形。依照該岡，共眾在六月間，顯無企圖佔據東北野心，惟時至今日，延安已宣佈察哈爾·熟河及遼寗大部，爲中共解放區，並將由共軍防守，不使國軍入內。查共軍起初所據地區，爲營口及葫蘆島，其後又擴大至北寗路沿綫之秦皇島至藩陽一帶，最後又擴展至瀋陽長春附近，局勢日趨惡化。蔣主席派往長春官員，不得不撤離東北。</p>
<h3>美議員楚德要求國會　應繼續援助我政府　離棄中國無異放棄勝利　中美澳合組對日對濟政策委會</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿一日電〕美衆院議員楚德，頃要求國會應綢續援助中國中央政府，據稱：吾人所以與日本發生戰爭，實因吾大已最後覺悟，絕不能讓日本統治中國，日本統治中國即等於統治整個亞洲，吾人豈能離棄中國，而將以絕大代價換來之勝利付諸東流？蔣委員長如早願脫離聯合國家，則彼獲得和平之機會何止數次，戰爭尚未完全結束，中國境內尚有日軍約二百萬，等候繳械，遣送返國，吾人不能爲謀求和平而即捨棄蔣委員長。又稱迄今吾人所爲者，僅爲擊敗德日，至於吾人獲得戰爭之勝利，胥視吾人今後之作爲而完，無論何種力量與思想，其能主宰歐洲之建設及亞洲之發展者方為戰勝。</p>
<h3>徐堪在京談話　軍糧民食無慮</h3>

<h3>社論　重與讀者相見</h3>
<p>今天申報復刋，對愛護我們的讀者，彷彿舊友重逢，百感交集。萬語千言，眞不知從何說起。</p>
<p>申報是上海的報，上海市民的報，由上海而發行及於全國的老報。它同上海的發朕結着七十三年的歷史。今天我們復刋，帶着沉痛與歡悅的心情，重與讀者相見。</p>
<p>申報在過去對中國的新聞界，文化界，乃至社會一般方面曾盡過一些微勞，除了廿六年因國軍西撤，曾一度停刋外，在它的出版紀錄上，從沒有　過刊；可是自太平洋戰事起後。申報即爲敵僞所刦持，行動失去了自由，此後雖仍有申報之刊行，已非申報自由意志之表示，於法於理，均屬無效。故由報今日　刋，其號數上承中華民國三十年十二月八日。這四年間，世界經過重大的變動，中國也經過重大的變動。我們的長期抗　，在　明的蔣主席領趙之下，終於獲得了最後的勝利。可是申報因爲喪失了意志的自由，對於世事的變遷，未能爲忠實的紀錄。這是我們所感到負疚而最沉痛的一件事。</p>
<p>申報在抗戰初期當國軍西撤，上海租界還存留之際，我們一面除借重美商不爲敵塞所屈外，更在漢口香港先後出版，在這中間，申報記者金君華亭曾爲敵僞狙擊以死，其他同人則或棋被凌逼而不甘屈服，感受盡苦難而志節不移，都足爲我申報永留正氣。但無論如何，今日申報雖已還我淸白面目，而帶着四年的創傷，重與讀者相見，我們的心情，彷彿與萬千滯留在上海受盡敵僞暴政下痛苦的市民一樣。上海市民的痛苦，光復區人民的痛苦，應該就是申報的痛苦。今日舊友相逢，彼此都懷着沉重的心情，這心情也惟有彼此最能了解。</p>
<p>沒有沉痛就不會感覺到歡悅的眞情，今日堅苦的抗戰是達到了它被預期的目的了，揚言可以在三個月內使我們屈滕的敵人，如今却屈膝在我們及我們盟國之前。這人年的抗戰。我同胞所受到的苦難，也眞是一言難盡。苦盡甘來，現在敵人是屈伏了，我們　着歡悅的心情，巡步踏入建國的歷史階段。正在這個時候，申報重與讀者相見，我們這一腔歡悅之情，讀者當也不難想知。</p>
<p>的確，橫置在我們前面的並不能使我們有過分的衹悅。如今敵寇雖降，國內交通秩序諸待恢復，國際局勢也未十分明朗，即所謂收復區的諸般措置亦未必全如我們的預期；然而抗戰之得以勝利結束，這本身已使我們够歡悅了。這次抗戰在中國民族的歷史上實是空前的。今日申報復刋，對無數爲抗戰而死難的軍民同胞。謹先致其無限的迫悼與敬意。要不是他們的犧牲，我們那有今天？上海雖曾久淪敵手，可是在抗戰初期也曾有渦英烈的史實，而報人先後的成仁，使民族正氣，永留歇浦。如今面臨建國階段，上海爲國內第一都市，當必在此艱巨的工作上更有所表現，以與抗戰初期的英烈史實相輝映。</p>
<p>今天申報復刋，我們首先要說明它是民問主辦的報。申報顧名思義不但是上海的報，同時還要申報民隱，申報民情。今天人民有什麼隱衷，我們要將它們宣達出來。今日人民對於建國前途有什麼意見，我們願意將它們表示出來。申報是上海市民的公器，推而廣之，也是全國人民的公器，我們當本過去爲人民服務的意旨，繼續爲人民作喉舌。</p>
<p>申報過去在學術文化方面曾有所努力，曾先後列行過中國大地圖，分省地圖，申報年鑑，申報月刋，又曾舉辦補習學校及助學金。我們在經過多年的創傷之後，現有的能力，雖未必一如往昔；但爲學術文化而努力之意願，却與往昔無殊。學術文化爲建國之本；倘不從學術文化方面爲基本的努力，則事事勢必仰給於國外，實有背於建國之大計。今後申報對此方面的努力，目前雖無若何具體計劃可言，但仍願一本初衷，稍盡棉薄。</p>
<p>此外，吾人尚有不能不一言者，即民主國家的述設當以公正與論爲基礎，而過去報紙每以「有聞必錄」爲口號，以致內容龐雜，徒亂讀者耳目，甚至無形中爲社會增紛擾，需國家釀變亂。申報復刋，沒有什麼崇高的理想，但願爲讀者作新聞忠實之報通，爲國家作公正與論的前驅。在新聞自由的號召下，盡其鑒別取捨之能事，不使新聞的散布，發生顚倒是非之作用。登載一件事，發表一句話，必再三斟酌是否於人民大衆有益，是否於國家大局世界大局有補。所以對於忠實新聞之報道，及公正輿論之宣揚，是我們今後所應努力的又一端。</p>
<p>世變方殷，國家多故，有待論列之事甚多。自今以後，申報將每日與讀者相見，亦即將每日向讀者貢其管見。復刋倉卒，姑先言止於此。尚望讀者隨時指敎，匡其不逮，俾申報得以日新又新，這是同人所鑄祝的。</p>

<h3>晨友盃昨賽　梁溪倖勝綠林　V隊險遭飛馬毒手</h3>
<p>晨友盃甲組昨晚二場，以隊伍之號召力未見强旺，最觀眾並不十分擁擠，唯兩場比賽過程均有緊張戰情，結果俱以一球之差分輸贏。</p>
<p>首場V隊鬥飛馬，上場之初，V隊頗見順利，節節佔先，視明星又見活躍，可稱個中翹楚。但在十一比五後，飛馬忽見順利，袁達南有投必中，V隊似有阻撓，反見一蹶不振。上半時飛馬以二〇對一七領先，下半時開始後，雙方競爭至烈，逼至各二十三平手時，飛馬又一氣呵成八分，不得不使V隊暫停。商討戰略後，果然——氣竣一髪，夏厲邊陲俱見中的，漸漸追越而過，直至鑼聲響處，V隊終以三六對三四勝飛馬。</p>
<p>次場為梁溪戰綠林，前者有卓國榮·陳學崇·楊元龍·張錦璇等名將，後者係一般小將，唯在錢旭滄之諄諄指導之下，不論戰術與夫態度方面，俱見頭頭是道。上場後，梁溪張錦璇賴罰球先獲兩分後，綠林沉着應戰，即見脫頴而上，陳國鎮林少華獲分纍纍，反觀梁溪，則大有格格不入之勢，楊元龍生疏異常，陳學崇顯有孤掌難鳴，但究以資格較老，未見分數落後。綠林則其中以經騐稍淺，不免有犯規過多之嫌，但以其球路之尚準確，追隨不放，且時超出，分數上落，　在一二球之差。迨上半時完畢，綠林終以一五對一四小勝一分，下半時開始後，局勢依然，綠林始終領前三四之間，梁溪雖欲振作，亦有無機會之苦。在最後一分三十秒時，陳學崇·張錦　·各有妙射中的，未幾時間告終，梁溪得以二十三對二十一倖勝一球，綠林慘遭敗北。</p>
<h3>介紹國立幼稚師範學校</h3>
<p>— 陳鶴琴</p>
<p>國立幼稚師範學校，是國內第一個國立幼稚師範，成立於民國二十九年十月，校址在江西泰和。學生由各省市縣保送來學。最近兩年畢業生一百八十九人，均先後為各方爭先羅致，担任幼稚園與低年級主任或教員。近數年各省幼稚教育之蓬勃發展，可說是幼師數年來培育之功！</p>
<p>當幼師初創　時，倍嘗艱苦：回憶師生從各地來到學校，但見校址，是一片荒山。於是全體師生振作精神，跑上山去，披荆斬棘，伐木担石，從事理想校舍之建築與交通之整理。結果，築成辦公室一幢，教室一幢，宿舍九幢，工作室二幢。這時，師生所得安居之樂，遠勝手足胼胝之勞。課後散步，遠見四山拱抱，松林蓊鬰，晚風吹來，松濤奔騰，斜陽古塔，極饒幽趣。</p>
<p>在師生共同信念中，我們訂定了三個信條，可以見到這個學校教育之主張與物質：（一）做人，做中國人，做現代中國人。（二）做中學，做中教，做中求進步。（三）大自然，大社會，都是活教材。</p>
<p>最近，中央鑒於幼稚教育之重要，為積極推行起見，擬將幼師附設之幼稚師範專科，遷於上海續辦，聞不久即可實現。</p>
<p>我因最近在滬担任市教育局督導之職，協助　局長辦理戰後上海教育復員工作，並擬以新的教育方法，輔導全市教育工作人員，建設上海新教育。幼專如能遷滬，我又多一幼稚教育實騐之機會，深願早日實現。</p>

<h3>市况一班</h3>
<p>金銀貨幣</p>
<p>赤昨（二十一日）市况極為平靜，業中人致興趣又淡，以買戶更怠，國共問題情况好轉，投機家難以興風作浪，趨勢亦疲，結果遂較前日略跌。</p>
<p>美鈔隨金價而趨疲，惟頗有套買，中途屢有起仆，港幣以廣帮中得港澳來電，廢幣在彼處，約值老幣三分之一，在市流通，合滬價約值九十元左右之訊，買風復熾，（一）字頭一九三六年曾漲到七十八元，（二）字頭及一九三七年昇為七十六元，有買戶，最後略有回小，結果較前日好起半成。</p>
<p>銀元頗多零星買戶，極為平穩，全日始終掙扎於四五〇元至四七〇元間，暗拆金證兩業，續以去路毫無而鬆，惟業外需款孔亟，有貼二角以上者，普通仍站住一角半至一角八分間。</p>
<p>證券　公債自前日轉穩後，初開尚平，中途以北帮脫金後，游資重歸懷抱，大戶代北帮大量購買，市價突晋，午刻浮多獲利了結，漲後小回，結果仍較前日好起一成至一成半。其所以驟見活動者，蓋以華股自經市府禁止買賣後，昨日已無交易，於是一般散戶，忽移轉其目的於乏人問津之公債故也，惟公開場所依然停業，人心因廣帮垂青，紗廠由疲轉堅，散戶手中之游資，　逄低前來吸納，各　　股結果較前日回好一成左右，開暗市成交美亞三百元，紗廠四百元，景福廿三元，新光廿七元，勤興廿一元</p>
<p>燃料　煤市高檔貨白煤塊及上等烟煤塊存底枯竭，持貨者均以奇貨可居，不願輕易放手，價承前趨勢，節節上升，上等烟煤層內江輪船納胃頗盛，亦呈挺堅。柴炭各路到貨見湧，吸胃亦健，喊價乃高，但較煤價仍廉。</p>
<p>呢羢　呢羢交易冷落，因各地客帮，大都觀望，本街又實銷呆滯，况銀根仍緊，以致市價均較上日回小。</p>
<p>馬口鐵　近來馬口鐵交易零多整少，因工廠大率猶未復工，故實銷呆滯，惟客路買賣尚稱熱鬧，然以火油箱坯子居多，蓋亞細亞美孚兩公司之存貨，前被日方侵佔，而今則源源流出，充斥市場矣。</p>
<p>桐油　昨日僅江北帮吸納洪江油，他若足度白油等走銷俱見狹隘，市情在此種情形下，人心亦續告平定，各貨售價，均在原途，計白油每斤三五〇元，洪江油四百元。</p>
<p>茶葉　趨勢仍俏，蓋以　需買戶進胃尚悅，故中途一般需要頭寸用者，仍在塞出，然無甚刺激，紅綠茶行情各見生色，迨到收市結果，均較上日軋漲甚多。</p>
<p>人造絲　以金市頹疲，跟趨軟化，計一二〇支天橋，現買進六二萬，賣出六四萬，棧單買進四七萬五千元，賣出五萬元，其他鮮有交易云</p>

<p>小談</p>
<h3>自由談談</h3>
<p>— 黄嘉音</p>
<p>自由談不能自由之後，編者遠走重慶，到自由區呼吸自由空氣。现在扰戰勝利，上海重見天日，申報復刋，自由談重獲自由。編者願意藉這個機會舆各位久遠的讀者自由談談。</p>
<p>在今日，報紙已經成爲人民一日不可或缺的精神糧食了。記得在重慶的時候，編者有一天早上出去散步，看見有一位剛從菜塲回来的主婦。一手提着裝滿的菜篮，小菜上面還有一份當天的報紙。把報紙提高到舆日常的糧食同樣的地位，這使編者得封極深刻的印象，覺得抗戰八年來，中國有些地方的確是進步了。</p>
<p>副刋是報紙新聞版的輔助讀物物，負有補充新聞報導，增廣讀者見識，和教育大衆的重要使命。因此編者覺得自已的責任實在不小，爲大乘副刋所應有的使命起見，希望各位作者讀者，多多幫助。</p>
<p>我覺得一種良好的精神糧食，與我们的日常食物一樣，必須是衛生的，可口的，同時是營養的。换句括說，副刊的文字必須有淸醒而正確的觀點，才能給讀者以好影響。副刋的文字必須通俗而有趣味，才會引起讀者閱讀的興趣。但是通俗決非庸俗，趣味也不一定就要低級。此外，副刋的文字必須言有其物，使讀者能接觸現實，吸收其精華，增進知識</p>
<p>今後的自由談，希望能根據以上幾個簡單的原則去做。編者希望能逐日供給申報的讀者一份衛生，可口，而營養的精神糧食，盼望各位文友，多多供給材料。</p>
<p>通訊</p>
<h3>東北人心未死</h3>
<p>— 天牧</p>
<p>——長春通訊</p>
<p>雙十節的前一天，下午五點鐘的時候，中央政府所派的東北行營設營人員所乘的第一架飛機，到達了這淪陷十四年的國土長春。到機塲上去接飛機的，是蘇聯的長春衛戌司令加爾羅夫將軍。</p>
<p>當日本投降的消息正式公佈之後，忍無可忍，隱忍了十四年的東北民氣，一下子就爆發了。不願做亡國奴的東北民衆，以及僞滿軍隊，曾與日軍發生不算小的衝突。老百姓打日本人的事件，也隨時隨地在發生着。直到八月十八日蘇聯軍隊進入長春，才停止衝突。偽滿的官吏，被捕的被捕，逃亡的逃亡。經蘇軍的同意，在束北黨務聯合辦事處的策動下，才成立了慶祝勝利大會和臨時性質的長春特別市政府。歡迎國軍的工作，和地方治安的維持，到這時候才有歸宿。</p>
<p>長春市的馬路，寬廣而平坦。不論華尙日商的店鋪，均未營業。所以市面的情景，頗現凄凉狀態。</p>
<p>長春老百姓歡迎國軍的熱情，固然達於極點，而日本人對於國軍，也寄予極大的熱望。日本居留民會並且在衝要路口，立了許多木牌，上面寫着『歡迎勞苦功高的中央軍」，「蔣主席萬歲」等標語。</p>
<p>街上所看見的蘇軍並不多，因爲已經陸續開走了。但是重要交通路口，仍有蘇軍警衛。市上交通的指揮，也有不少是由蘇軍的婦女輔助隊担任的。美國出品的吉浦車，通用汽車公司所出的十輪大卡車，在長春的馬路上行駛的很多，但是車身所漆的，不是美國的白色五角星，面是蘇聯的紅星。長春的交通規定，原來是向左走的，自蘇軍進駐　以後，已經改爲靠右走了。大同路被改爲　斯太林路，大同廣塲變成斯太林廣塲。廣塲上正趕修一座蘇聯陣亡將士紀念碑，限十月底完工。據蘇聯方面宣佈，此次對日作戰，他們犧牲了官兵八千多名。</p>
<p>以往以太上皇自居的日本人，現在都埀頭喪氣，狼狽不堪。自日本投降，僞滿洲國瓦解之後，平常優於中國人的配給，已經同時停止。最初祇好吃自已所屯積的一點糧食，隨後就不得不擺地攤，把所能賣的一點東西賣掉，然後向中國人換糧食吃。現在有些狼狽的日本人，已經在向中國人的油條鋪販賣麻花汕條以維持生活了。</p>
<p>一般中國民衆，雖受了十四年的苦，但到街上一看，大家精神都非常興奮。當吉林省黨部招待接收人員到三馬路該黨部去參觀時，民衆把那些空軍人員，包圍得水洩不通，大家競相高呼『中華民國萬歲』，『歡迎中央　『等口號。</p>
<p>因爲正式接收尙未開始，所以市面所流通的幣制，仍是僞滿洲國的鈔票和蘇軍所發的軍用票。前者所看到的有十元和百元兩種，軍用票則祇有十元的。長春一般的物價都很低。比布慶的華福牌好的當貴牌香烟，每包祇賣七八元。據說毛織品的西裝，的二千元左右就可以買一套。不過因爲接收人員都不許帶法幣，市面上根本也沒有法幣流通，法幣與現行幣制的兌換率尙未規定，所以東西的貴賤，一時也很難說起。</p>
<p>有許多人也許以爲東北二十歲以下的靑年，一定都不會說中國話了，其實不然。我曾與一位十六歲的靑年談了一兩小時話，據說小學課程中，日語與滿語（即國語）所佔的時間，是三與—之比。敎師也是三個日本人，一個中國人。在學校裏的時候，雖然一定要說日文，可是回家時仍說國語，寫漢文。雖然是十六歲的小孩，可是他的國家民族思想，並不在大後方一般中小學學生以下。『中國不會亡』並不是信口亂說的。淪陷了十四年的東北人民，可作『民心不死』的鐵證。據說日本投降以後，有一位七十多歲的老太婆說：『我再看見滿街掛着青天白日旗，就是死了都甘心！』</p>
<p>因爲淪陷了十四年的東北，已經找不出一而國旗了，因此接收人員特地從重慶帶來了不少的國旗。在北平的時候，看見滿街所掛的，都是八年前的舊旗子，到了長春，却都是全新的黨國旗。連日本人的門口，也掛起一面國旗，一而蘇聯旗。</p>

<h3>敵人　（The　Enemy）（一）</h3>
<p>— 賽珍珠著　朱綺譯</p>
<p>前言</p>
<p>二次大戰期間，有許多國外名著，上海的讀者都沒有看到。今後我們準備在自由談利春秋的篇幅中，陸續介紹一些這一類的作品。本文是美國名女作家賽珍珠女士的短篇名著，曾得一九四三年美國奧。寧利紀念獎。賽珍珠女士自幼生長在中國，以『大地』一書成名，於一九三八年得諾貝爾文藝獎金。本篇叙述一個留美的日本醫師和美國俘虜的故事。全文的十日刋完。—編者</p>
<p>貞雄沖醫師的屋子，建造在在日本海賓，那裏是他小時候玩要的地方。這座低矮的方石屋，建造在一片狹海灘旁高起的岩石上，海灘旁羅列着許多俯灣的松樹。貞雄小時候常常爬到這些松樹上去像他在南南洋看見人家爬上樹去採摘椰子一樣，廿他的赤脚來爬。他的父親以前常常帶他到南洋的那些島上去，他父親總不會忘了告訴這在他身邊的嚴肅的小男孩說：『前面的這些島嶼是日本未來的踏足石。』</p>
<p>貞雄正正經經地問道：『我們要從這裏走到那裏去呢？』</p>
<p>他父親的回答是：『誰知道？誰能限制我們的將來？我們的將來是全靠我們自己去創造的。』</p>
<p>貞雄將這些話記在心裏，正如他記牢他父親所講的一切話。他父親從不曾和他開過玩笑，從不曾和他玩過，　苦心孤詣地去敎他的獨生子。貞雄知道他的敎育是他父親最關心的事。就為了這個緣故，他在二十二歲上便給送到了美國去學外科和醫科。到了三十歲他才回國，他父親在去世以前，不但看見貞雄當外科醫生出了名，而且還成了個著名的科學家。因爲他現在正在完成一個能使傷口完全清潔的發明，所以也沒有和軍隊一同被送到海外去。他也知道他之至今還能留在日本，是因爲那老將軍的病也許須施行一次手術，這病現在是在用導物治療着的。</p>
<p>雲霧正自海洋上昇起。前幾日出乎意外的和暖，引起了夜間從寒冷的波濤上生出的濃霧。貞雄看着那陣霧掩藏了一個近岸小島的輪郭，再爬上了屋了下面的海灘，包團了松樹。再幾分鐘，這陣霧就要籠罩住這屋子了，他就要進屋裏去，屋子裏有他的妻在花子，帶着兩個孩子在等他。</p>

        <h1>1945 - n318</h1>
<h3>National Army Presses Xingcheng and Huludao; Arrives at Various Passes Inside the Great Wall; Martial Law in Tianjin and Beijing, Reinforcements Continue to Arrive</h3>
<p>[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 21st] The National Army advanced forward in three routes after crossing the pass, making rapid progress. They have not encountered resistance and have already penetrated 180 *li* into the nine eastern provinces, which is 400 *li* from the Shenyang Railway Station. Sources stated this morning that they are approaching Xingcheng on the Beining Railway line and are expected to reach Huludao, 51 *li* northeast of Xingcheng, within a day or two.</p>
<p>[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 21st] The weather in Tianjin is turning cold, and winter defense has begun. Military and police deployments have been strengthened in the urban and suburban areas. Patrol teams have been formed in the city, combined with police security, and traffic is restricted at night, ensuring the safety of Tianjin.</p>
<p>[United Press Chongqing Dispatch, 21st] Government military observers announced today that the railway from Shanhaiguan to Shenyang is a total of 750 *li*, of which 240 *li* have already been occupied by the National Army. The remaining 510 *li* should not be difficult to occupy soon, because the Beining Railway runs parallel to the Liao River, with no defenses in between. It is claimed that if the National Army reaches Shenyang, it will be unprecedented in Chinese military history. There have been no previous reports of troops from inside the pass fighting their way outside the pass. The Communist army is continuing to concentrate troops in the Northeast and recruit new soldiers, some of whom are workers and Japanese soldiers.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Military authorities reported that the invading forces of the Communist 16th Military Region are still attempting to obstruct the National Army's landing. It is possible that a fierce war will break out in the Jinzhou area, with the Communist army's goal clearly being to defend the seaport of Shenyang. As for inside the Great Wall, the National Army's 92nd and 94th Armies are using Tianjin and Beijing as bases to advance north, with the goal of passing through the Communist-occupied areas of northeastern Hebei to reach the other passes of the Great Wall.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] A portion of the National Army has advanced to Gubeikou (70 *li* north of Beiping) and will soon establish contact with Beiping. However, the railway from Beiping to Gubeikou was recently damaged by the Communist army. National Army troops in Tianjin and Tangshan are also advancing north, heading directly for Xifengkou.</p>
<p>[United Press Beiping Dispatch, 21st] The 11th War Area announced that the National Army will continue to deploy to North China to reinforce the 92nd and 94th Armies.</p>
<p>[United Press Chongqing Dispatch, November 21st] Strict inspections of people entering and leaving Beiping's fifteen city gates have begun to prevent armed Communist elements from infiltrating the city. The two airports in the western and southern suburbs of Beiping have also been placed under strict guard. Few aircraft are kept at the airports overnight, as the Communist army is currently very close to the western suburban airport, only about one *li* away.</p>
<h3>Communist Army Actively Implements Conscription</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Yulin Dispatch, 20th] After returning to Yan'an, Communist leader Mao Zedong is actively implementing a conscription policy in various places, using the pretext of the "liberated area" expanding. All men and women of conscription age are being drafted to replenish the Communist forces and sent to the newly expanded "liberated area."</p>
<h3>Commander-in-Chief Yan Returns to Taiyuan from Chongqing</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Taiyuan Dispatch, 20th] Commander-in-Chief of the Second War Area, Yan Xishan, flew back to Taiyuan from Chongqing at 4:00 PM on the 20th. He spoke with responsible persons from the party, government, military, and press circles at the provincial government office, stating briefly that the rehabilitation of the war area would be handled in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Military Administration, and that relief supplies for the recovered areas of Shanxi province were en route.</p>
<h3>Farewell Changchun</h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent Xi Hong</p>
<p>At noon on November 17th, ten large transport planes, which had just landed at Changchun Airport five minutes earlier, suddenly took off again, carrying 190 provincial chairmen, mayors, and special commissioners from the Northeast, who were all in a somber mood, back to Beiping. They were all officials dispatched by the National Government to take over the Northeast. They had been arriving from Chongqing since October 8th, but due to the complex internal and external situation in the Northeast, the takeover work encountered major difficulties, and they were ordered by the government to temporarily move to Beiping. This was the first group to move to Beiping. In the next two or three days, if there were no new major developments, more than 200 personnel from the Northeast Headquarters would be transferred to Beiping. Representing the Northeast Headquarters to remain were a military delegation of six people, led by Deputy Chief of Staff Dong Yanping, who will follow the Soviet headquarters. The decision to move to Beiping was reportedly notified to Soviet Ambassador Petrov by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 14th, and the Northeast Headquarters was ordered to notify the Changchun Soviet Headquarters on the 15th.</p>
<p>The issue of the National Army taking over the Northeast is the core of all difficulties. The military authorities initially planned to have the National Army land in Dalian, but due to the Soviet explanation that the commercial port could not be used for military purposes, the government planned for the National Army to land in Yingkou, Huludao, and Dadonggou, and agreed with the Soviet side to begin on November 10th. On the 6th, they received a notice from the Soviet Headquarters that the Eighth Route Army had arrived in the above-mentioned areas, making the landing unsafe. The originally prepared airlift plan was also difficult to implement because only one usable airfield remained near Changchun.</p>
<p>Administratively: the Soviet side had recently asked the provincial mayors to go to various places for the takeover after the 12th, but the takeover of the Changchun municipal government was not included. With the National Army unable to arrive quickly and in large numbers, and the situation in various places not simple, the takeover personnel felt unable to go.</p>
<p>Economically: It is worth noting the establishment of the Changchun Railway Council and the start of postal and telecommunications takeover. As for the major industrial and mining enterprises in the Northeast, after a war, even if they were not destroyed by artillery fire, the equipment would still need to be rebuilt. Of the remaining machines, due to the lack of a consistent interpretation of the definition of "war booty," who will take over in the future? How will they be used and managed? This may also become a difficult problem.</p>
<p>Because there is no prospect of overcoming so many difficulties in the short term, the takeover personnel cannot complete their mission, and the significance of residing in Changchun disappears. Therefore, the Chang Headquarters decided to leave a military delegation to reside with the Soviet Headquarters, and the rest of the personnel would be transferred to Beiping. After the Northeast Headquarters notified the Soviet Headquarters of this decision by the government on the 16th, the other party welcomed the dispatch of the military delegation, did not express any opinion on the move to Beiping, and only notified the Third Army to assist.</p>
<p>"This is the government's great decisiveness, great wisdom, and great courage!" At 10:00 AM on the 16th, Director Zhang Jia'ao, replacing Director Xiong Tianyi, who was in Chongqing, announced this major order in the auditorium of the Headquarters, and finally exhorted: "You all came happily, and you must leave happily." However, the heads of the people below the stage were lowered. The atmosphere around the Headquarters was tense for a while that afternoon, but later, with the help of the Soviet army, everything calmed down.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 17th, everyone jumped into the twelve trucks prepared by the Soviet army without eating breakfast. The people nearby who got the news felt like they had fallen from the clouds into a deep valley, wondering if they had been dreaming not long ago. An old woman grasped a stack of full bills, asking someone to bring it to her son far away in Chongqing. Two women, with their children, raised their last hope and asked someone to send a letter to their husband who had been separated for fourteen years. At the airport, when we went to buy breakfast, "You just got off the plane! You must be tired!" The old man selling snacks still thought everyone had just come from Chongqing! After buying some things, the old man quietly asked,</p>
<p>"Japan has surrendered, why is there still no peace?"</p>
<p>"Why haven't our troops come yet?"</p>
<p>"Goodbye, Changchun!" At 12:10 PM, the plane slowly took off. Everyone saw the Northeast mountains and rivers, which had been lost for only about a month, and had been occupied for fourteen years, slowly fading and disappearing. But there was no sense of emptiness in my heart, but a heavier mood. In front of the silver wings was a vast expanse of clouds, rolling up thousands of piles of snow. Some towering peaks showed their faces on this sea of clouds, but some invisible crags were buried beneath this sea of clouds that separated the clear sky from the earth. Any plane flying over this would be lost, or rashly crash into the reefs in the sea of clouds. Human wisdom can create atomic bombs, missiles, wireless X-rays, why can't it produce a gust of wise wind to blow away these clouds? At this time, I once again thought of a conversation with a far-sighted politician a week ago: "The development of relations between the Allied countries in the Northeast will affect the fate of countries along the Pacific coast and even all of humanity." Now, no matter which ship of fate, it has just emerged from the bloody sea of a cruel war. Everyone should be so careful not to row into another bloody sea! (Sent from Beiping on November 19th)</p>
<h3>Communist Army in Henan Province Continues to Invade; Exerts All Efforts to Destroy Railway Bridges in North China</h3>

<h3>Regarding the Matter of Saving the Northeast Crisis, It is Reported that We Have Submitted a Proposal to the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Most Northeast Headquarters Personnel Withdrawn</p>
<p>[United Press Chongqing Dispatch, November 21st] According to reliable sources, regarding the Sino-Soviet agreement to improve the situation in the Northeast, the Chinese authorities have submitted a proposal to Soviet Ambassador to China, Petrov, for transmission to Moscow. The Soviet Union has agreed to allow the Chinese government to use the airfields in northern Manchuria. This concession, however, has no practical value because technical limitations make it impossible for our airlift to proceed smoothly.</p>
<p>[Reuters Chongqing Dispatch, 21st] The main point of contention in the current military conflict between the Nationalists and Communists is the control of political power in the Northeast. The Soviet authorities are closely monitoring the armed conflict between the two sides. According to unconfirmed reports from Chongqing, Sino-Soviet negotiations will begin in the near future to discuss and resolve the Northeast dispute. Last month, on the 13th, Northeast Headquarters Director Xiong Shihui and a certain Soviet official held negotiations in Changchun to discuss the issue of the National Army entering the Northeast in accordance with the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance. It is reported that the atmosphere at the meeting was extremely harmonious, but by October 25th, the Soviet attitude suddenly became stronger, and the Communist army simultaneously began to invade the Northeast. This reporter had the opportunity to see a secret military map of the Communist army this past June, which showed the strength and distribution of the Communist army. According to that map, the Communist party clearly had no intention of occupying the Northeast in June. However, today, Yan'an has announced that Chahar, Rehe, and most of Liaoning are Communist-liberated areas and will be defended by the Communist army, preventing the National Army from entering. Initially, the areas occupied by the Communist army were Yingkou and Huludao, which later expanded to Qinhuangdao to Fanyang along the Beining Railway line, and finally expanded to the vicinity of Shenyang and Changchun, and the situation is deteriorating. The officials sent by Chairman Chiang to Changchun had to withdraw from the Northeast.</p>
<h3>U.S. Congressman Judd Asks Congress to Continue Aiding Our Government; Abandoning China is Equivalent to Abandoning Victory; China, the United States, and Australia Form Committee on Economic Policy Toward Japan</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington Dispatch, 21st] U.S. Congressman Judd recently asked Congress to continue to aid the central government of China, stating that we went to war with Japan because we finally realized that we must never allow Japan to rule China. Japan's rule over China is equivalent to ruling all of Asia. How can we abandon China and let the victory we have paid such a great price for go to waste? Chairman Chiang would have had countless opportunities to obtain peace if he had been willing to leave the United Nations earlier. The war is not completely over, and there are still about two million Japanese troops in China waiting to surrender and be sent back to their country. We cannot abandon Chairman Chiang in order to seek peace. He also stated that so far, all we have done is defeat Germany and Japan. As for whether we will obtain victory in the war, it depends entirely on what we do in the future. Whatever force or ideology can dominate the reconstruction of Europe and the development of Asia will be victorious.</p>
<h3>Xu Kan Talks in Nanjing: No Worries About Military or Civilian Food</h3>

<h3>Editorial: Meeting Readers Again</h3>
<p>Today, with the re-publication of the Shen Bao, our feelings are mixed, as if old friends are reuniting with our cherished readers. Ten thousand words and a thousand phrases cannot express how we feel.</p>
<p>The Shen Bao is Shanghai's newspaper, the newspaper of the Shanghai citizens, and the old newspaper that originated in Shanghai and spread throughout the country. It is linked to Shanghai's development with seventy-three years of history. Today, we resume publication, bearing feelings of grief and joy, to meet our readers again.</p>
<p>In the past, the Shen Bao has made some humble contributions to China's journalism, culture, and even society in general. Except for a brief suspension of publication in the 26th year (1937) of the Republic due to the National Army's westward retreat, there had never been an interruption in its publication record. However, since the start of the Pacific War, the Shen Bao was seized by the enemy and puppets, losing its freedom of action. Although the Shen Bao continued to be published thereafter, it no longer represented the free will of the Shen Bao and was legally and logically invalid. Therefore, with the newspaper's republication today, its numbering continues from December 8, the 30th year (1941) of the Republic of China. In these four years, the world has undergone significant changes, and China has also undergone significant changes. Our long-term resistance, under the leadership of the wise Chairman Chiang, finally achieved ultimate victory. However, because the Shen Bao lost its freedom of will, it failed to provide a faithful record of the changes in the world. This is something we feel guilty about and is the most painful.</p>
<p>During the early stage of the War of Resistance, when the National Army retreated westward and the Shanghai concessions still existed, we not only relied on American merchants who refused to succumb to the enemy, but also published in Hankou and Hong Kong successively. During this period, Shen Bao reporter Jin Jinhua Ting was assassinated by the enemy and puppets, while other colleagues were either intimidated or refused to surrender, enduring hardships while maintaining their integrity. All of this is sufficient for our Shen Bao to forever maintain its upright spirit. However, no matter what, although the Shen Bao has regained its innocence today, it is meeting readers again with four years of wounds. Our feelings are similar to those of the thousands of Shanghai citizens who were stranded and suffered under the tyranny of the enemy and puppets. The suffering of the Shanghai citizens and the suffering of the people in the recovered areas should be the Shen Bao's suffering. Today, old friends meet, and we all harbor heavy hearts, and only we can truly understand each other's feelings.</p>
<p>Without grief, one cannot feel the true joy. Today, the arduous War of Resistance has achieved its expected goal. The enemy, who claimed they could make us submit within three months, is now kneeling before us and our allies. The suffering endured by our compatriots during these eight years of resistance is truly indescribable. After hardship comes sweetness. Now that the enemy has surrendered, we are stepping into the historical stage of national reconstruction with joyful hearts. At this moment, the Shen Bao is meeting readers again, and readers should not find it difficult to imagine our joy.</p>
<p>Indeed, what lies before us should not make us overly joyful. Although the enemy has surrendered, domestic transportation and order still need to be restored, and the international situation is not yet fully clear. Even the various measures in the so-called recovered areas may not be entirely as we expected. However, the fact that the War of Resistance was able to end victoriously is enough to make us joyful. This War of Resistance is unprecedented in the history of the Chinese nation. Today, with the republication of the Shen Bao, we would first like to express our infinite condolences and respect to the countless soldiers and civilians who died in the War of Resistance. If not for their sacrifice, where would we be today? Although Shanghai was occupied by the enemy for a long time, it also had a history of heroic martyrs in the early stage of the War of Resistance, and the successive sacrifices of journalists have allowed the national spirit to forever remain in the Whangpoo. Now, facing the stage of national reconstruction, Shanghai, as the premier city in the country, will surely demonstrate even more in this arduous work, so as to complement the heroic and martyred historical events of the early stage of the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>Today, with the republication of the Shen Bao, we must first explain that it is a privately run newspaper. The Shen Bao, as the name suggests, is not only Shanghai's newspaper, but it also intends to report the people's hidden troubles and report the people's sentiments. Today, if the people have any hidden grievances, we will publicize them. Today, if the people have any opinions on the future of national reconstruction, we are willing to express them. The Shen Bao is a public tool for the Shanghai citizens, and by extension, it is also a public tool for the people of the entire country. We will continue to serve as a mouthpiece for the people, in accordance with our past intentions of serving the people.</p>
<p>In the past, the Shen Bao has made some efforts in academics and culture. It has successively published the China Grand Map, provincial maps, the Shen Bao Yearbook, and the Shen Bao Monthly. It has also established supplementary schools and scholarships. After years of trauma, our current capabilities may not be the same as in the past, but our desire to strive for academics and culture is no different from the past. Academics and culture are the foundation of national reconstruction. If we do not make fundamental efforts in academics and culture, we will inevitably rely on foreign countries for everything, which is contrary to the grand plan of national reconstruction. In the future, the Shen Bao's efforts in this area, although there are no specific plans to speak of at present, we are still willing to maintain our original intentions and make a small contribution.</p>
<p>In addition, there is something else we must mention, which is that the establishment of a democratic country should be based on just public opinion. In the past, newspapers often used "recording everything that is heard" as a slogan, resulting in a vast and complex content, which only confused readers and even invisibly increased social disturbances, requiring the country to cause chaos. The Shen Bao's republication does not have any lofty ideals, but only hopes to serve readers as a faithful news broadcaster and to be a pioneer of just public opinion for the country. Under the banner of freedom of the press, it will do its best to discern and select, so as not to allow the dissemination of news to have the effect of reversing right and wrong. When publishing an event or making a statement, it must be carefully considered whether it is beneficial to the people and the masses, and whether it is helpful to the overall situation of the country and the world. Therefore, the report of faithful news and the promotion of fair public opinion are another aspect that we should strive for in the future.</p>
<p>The world is changing rapidly, and the country is experiencing many difficulties. There are many things that need to be discussed. From now on, the Shen Bao will meet with readers every day, and it will also contribute its humble views to readers every day. The republication is rushed, so let us stop here for now. We hope that readers will give us guidance at any time, correct our shortcomings, so that the Shen Bao can be renewed every day. This is what my colleagues and I wish for.</p>

<h3>Nuremberg International Tribunal Continues Trial of Nazi War Criminals; Twenty Defendants Plead Not Guilty</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Nuremberg, 21st] When twenty Nazi leaders were publicly tried today, Göring and the other defendants' lawyers appealed against the legal basis of the war crimes trial, believing that if the trial could be based on international law and not create laws without authorization, it would be able to make a greater contribution to the progress of the world. The presiding judge, Lawrence, rejected the appeal and ordered the defendants to present their defense on the main points of the indictment. At the beginning of the court session, U.S. Chief Prosecutor Jackson stated the reasons for the indictment. The full text was 61 pages, detailing the history of the development of Nazism and its leaders, stating that the main plaintiff in this case is actually the culture of the world. The twenty people sitting in the defendant's seat today represent the darkest and most heinous forces in society. No matter how difficult the state of the country is, no matter how dissatisfied it is with the current situation, it must never be improved through illegal aggression. The crimes of the defendants are innumerable, mainly including consolidating Nazi power, launching aggression, colluding with Japan, and establishing political police. After the presiding judge announced a 15-minute recess, the lawyers talked with the defendants. The court was reopened at 11:00 a.m., and the presiding judge ordered the defendants to begin their defense. Göring first stepped to the microphone and pleaded not guilty. Hess only said the word "no", causing laughter from the audience. The presiding judge said that this meant pleading not guilty. Göring said, "As far as the meaning of the indictment is concerned, I do not recognize that I have committed a crime." Rosenberg, Frank, and Flick said the same as Ribbentrop. Former German financier Schacht only said the words "not guilty". General Dotel said, "I plead not guilty, because God also believes that what I have done is just a responsibility of my job." At that time, Göring stood up to speak, but the court stopped him, saying that only his defense lawyer was allowed to speak. At 12:26, the court announced an adjournment for continuation. All twenty defendants who appeared in court today pleaded not guilty.</p>
<h3>New American Invention: Image Photography: Images Can Also Be Taken Under Dark Red Light</h3>

<h3>Morning Friends Cup Game Yesterday: Liangxi Barely Wins Over Green Forest, V Team Narrowly Escapes Flying Horse's Clutches</h3>
<p>The Morning Friends Cup Group A games last night did not attract a very large audience because the teams' appeal was not very strong, but the two games were both tense. In the end, both were decided by a single point.</p>
<p>In the first game, V Team played Flying Horse. At the beginning of the game, V Team seemed to be doing well, taking the lead step by step, and Shi Mingxing was very active, arguably the best player. However, after 11 to 5, Flying Horse suddenly gained momentum, with Yuan Danan scoring every shot. V Team seemed to be hindered and fell into a slump. In the first half, Flying Horse led 20 to 17. After the start of the second half, the competition between the two sides was fierce, and when they were tied at 23 points each, Flying Horse scored eight points in a row, forcing V Team to call a timeout. After discussing strategy, they really managed to close the gap, with Xia Li and Bian Chui both scoring, gradually overtaking them. Until the final buzzer, V Team finally beat Flying Horse 36 to 34.</p>
<p>The second game was Liangxi versus Green Forest. The former had famous players such as Zhuo Guorong, Chen Xuesong, Yang Yuanlong, and Zhang Jinxuan, while the latter was a group of young players, but under the guidance of Qian Xuchang, they were methodical in terms of tactics and attitude. After the start of the game, Zhang Jinxuan of Liangxi scored two points first with a free throw, but Green Forest responded calmly and immediately took the lead. Chen Guozhen and Lin Shaohua scored repeatedly. On the other hand, Liangxi seemed out of sync, Yang Yuanlong was unusually rusty, and Chen Xuesong seemed to be fighting alone. However, because they were more experienced, their score was not far behind. Green Forest, on the other hand, was a little inexperienced, inevitably committing too many fouls, but their shots were still accurate, and they kept up the chase, even surpassing them at times. The scores fluctuated, with only a point or two separating them. By the end of the first half, Green Forest narrowly won 15 to 14. After the start of the second half, the situation remained the same, with Green Forest always leading by three or four points. Although Liangxi wanted to rally, they had no chance. With one minute and thirty seconds left, Chen Xuesong and Zhang Jin scored brilliant shots, and before long the time ran out. Liangxi barely won 23 to 21, and Green Forest suffered a bitter defeat.</p>
<h3>Introducing the National Kindergarten Normal School</h3>
<p>— Chen Heqin</p>
<p>The National Kindergarten Normal School is the first national kindergarten normal school in the country, established in October 1940, located in Taihe, Jiangxi. Students are recommended by provinces, cities, and counties. In the past two years, 189 graduates have been eagerly recruited by various parties to serve as directors or teachers in kindergartens and lower grades. The vigorous development of kindergarten education in various provinces in recent years can be said to be due to the cultivation of kindergarten teachers over the years!</p>
<p>When the kindergarten normal school was first founded, it suffered many hardships. I recall that when teachers and students came to the school from all over, they saw that the school site was a barren mountain. So all the teachers and students invigorated their spirits, ran up the mountain, cleared the thorns, cut down trees, carried stones, and engaged in the construction of ideal school buildings and the organization of transportation. As a result, they built one office building, one classroom building, nine dormitory buildings, and two studio buildings. At this time, the joy of living in peace that the teachers and students gained far outweighed the labor of their hands and feet. After class, walking around, one could see the four mountains surrounding them, the pine forests dense, the evening wind blowing, the pine waves rushing, and the ancient pagoda in the setting sun, which was extremely charming.</p>
<p>In the common beliefs of teachers and students, we have established three creeds, which can be seen in the school's educational propositions and material: (1) Be a person, be a Chinese, be a modern Chinese. (2) Do middle school, do Chinese education, do Chinese seeking progress. (3) Big nature, big society, are living teaching materials.</p>
<p>Recently, in view of the importance of kindergarten education, the central government intends to move the kindergarten normal school's attached kindergarten normal college to Shanghai for continued operation in order to actively promote it. It is said that it will be realized soon.</p>
<p>Because I am currently serving as a supervisor of the Municipal Education Bureau in Shanghai, assisting Director to handle the post-war educational rehabilitation work in Shanghai, and intend to use new educational methods to guide the city's education staff and build a new education in Shanghai. If the kindergarten college can move to Shanghai, I will have another opportunity to experiment with kindergarten education, and I sincerely hope that it will be realized soon.</p>

<h3>Du Yuesheng Convenes All Sectors to Discuss Ways to Stabilize Prices; Opinions Have Been Drafted and Telegraphed to Chairman Chiang</h3>
<p>Du Yuesheng, President of the Shanghai Local Association, leads Chairman Chiang's telegram, expressing great concern about the prices in Shanghai. The original telegram is as follows: "To Mr. Du Yuesheng: Prices in Shanghai are soaring, which has a huge impact on people's livelihood. It is said that unscrupulous merchants from Chongqing are rushing to purchase and hoard goods, trying to make huge profits, which has led to a chain reaction, stimulating the market and causing prices to rise. The local government should strictly investigate and crack down on this matter, and it is their unshirkable responsibility, but it also depends on exerting the power of social justice so that unscrupulous merchants know to restrain themselves. I hope that you, brother, who are highly respected and familiar with the situation in Shanghai, will express your opinions, contact upright people from all walks of life, and find ways to assist the government in stabilizing prices and lowering them. I am deeply hopeful. Chiang Kai-shek, Military Seal." After receiving the telegram, in addition to issuing a statement yesterday, Mr. Du has been convening people from all walks of life and representatives from important industries for days to discuss ways to help Mayor Qian and relevant authorities in order to make prices gradually stabilize and alleviate the Chairman's concern.

<h3>Reporter Group from Chengdu Visits Japanese Prisoner Concentration Camp; Should Be Banqueted by Qian Dajun This Afternoon</h3>

Lieutenant General Akio Doi, Chief of Staff of the Japanese 13th Army, and Colonel Makoto Okamura, Commander of the 149th Regiment of the 61st Division, both said: The leaders of the Japanese military have always believed that the Japanese nation is the most superior nation in the world, and at the same time, they fundamentally ignored the inherent traditional morality of "benevolence and righteousness" in the East, which led to the fate of defeat and surrender today. In the future, they must thoroughly change the above incorrect thoughts and behaviors and accept China's just leadership in order to seek permanent peace in the Far East. After the reporters had lunch at the Okamura Regiment Headquarters, they visited the management of the concentrated prisoners of war and the hospital facilities. At two o'clock, they went to the Japanese Overseas Chinese Management Office to visit the living conditions of the Japanese overseas Chinese in the concentration area.

As Chairman Chiang said, "This kind of perseverance is even more arduous and commendable than the bloody battles fought by the officers and soldiers on the front line under the bombing of airplanes and artillery." After the victory of the War of Resistance and the recovery of Shanghai, the comrades of the Lone Army who remained here received the care of Commander Tang, Mayor Qian, Deputy Mayor Wu, and people from all walks of life. Only a few suffered from malnutrition. Now that the Lone Army Camp has ended, the soldiers of the Lone Army have been able to re-enlist in the army to serve the country, and I, who was previously their commander, feel deeply gratified.</p>
<h3>Hankou Road and Jiujiang Road to be Converted to One-Way Traffic; Trial to Begin Next Week</h3>

The letter stated: After eight years of war against Japan, China's national strength and people's livelihood have been extremely exhausted, especially the people in the occupied areas who have suffered the ravages of the enemy.

Fortunately, under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, we have achieved the goal of victory, and the people have a chance to breathe, and industries are trying to rebuild. Unexpectedly, just when we were rejoicing, news of civil strife came, and the people who survived the disaster were terrified.

<p>The China Industrial Cooperative Association has been approved by the Four Joint Offices and has been allocated 150 million yuan by the Central Bank to help industrial production cooperatives in various places. The association has also allocated 150 million yuan to raise funds from British and American aid organizations, it is said.</p>
<h3>Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Gold, Silver, and Currency</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 21st), the market was extremely calm, and industry insiders' interest was also weak, as buyers were even more lazy. The situation of the KMT-CPC issue improved, and it was difficult for speculators to make waves, and the trend was also sluggish, so the result was slightly lower than the previous day.</p>
<p>The US dollar tended to weaken with the price of gold, but there was quite a bit of arbitrage. There were repeated ups and downs along the way. The Hong Kong dollar, because the Guangdong gang received telegrams from Hong Kong and Macau that the old currency was worth about one-third of the old currency there and circulated in the market, worth about 90 yuan in Shanghai, the buying trend was revived. The "1" header in 1936 once rose to 78 yuan, and the "2" header and 1937 rose to 76 yuan. There were buyers. The last slight return was small. The result was half a percent better than the previous day.</p>
<p>There were quite a few retail buyers of silver dollars, which were extremely stable. Throughout the day, it struggled between 450 yuan and 470 yuan. The underground gold and certificate businesses continued to loosen due to the complete lack of prospects, but the external demand for funds was urgent, with some offering more than two corners, but the average still stood at between 1.5 and 1.8 corners.</p>
<p>Securities and government bonds: After turning stable the day before yesterday, the initial opening was still flat. Midway, after the North Gang divested from gold, floating funds returned to their embrace, and large investors bought in large quantities on behalf of the North Gang, and the market price suddenly jumped. At noon, many floats made profits and closed out, and there was a small pullback after the rise. The result was still 10% to 15% better than the previous day. The reason why there was a sudden activity was that after the Municipal Government prohibited the trading of Chinese stocks, there were no transactions yesterday. As a result, general retail investors suddenly shifted their purpose to government bonds that no one cared about. However, the public place is still closed for business. Because Guang Gang favored it, and yarn factories turned from weak to firm, the floating funds in the hands of retail investors came to absorb them 　at low prices. As a result, the various 　　stocks returned to about 10% better than the previous day. In the dark market, the turnover was 300 yuan for Meiya, 400 yuan for yarn factory, 23 yuan for Jingfu, 27 yuan for Xinguang, and 21 yuan for Qinxing.</p>
<p>Fuels: In the coal market, high-grade goods such as white coal blocks and top-grade bituminous coal blocks are exhausted, and those who hold goods are unwilling to let go easily because they can live in them. The price followed the previous trend and rose steadily. Top-grade bituminous coal is in high demand by Jiangnei riverboats, and is also quite firm. Charcoal and charcoal from various roads are surging, and appetite is also healthy, so bidding prices are high, but they are still cheaper than coal prices.</p>
<p>Woolen cloth: The woolen cloth transaction was deserted, because customers from various places were mostly watching, and the street was also stagnant. In addition, the silver roots were still tight, resulting in a slight decline in market prices compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Tinplate: Recently, tinplate transactions have been mostly retail and less wholesale, because most factories have not yet resumed work, so actual sales are sluggish, but customer transactions are still lively, but mostly for kerosene tank blanks, because the inventory of Asia Petroleum and Socony was invaded by the Japanese in the past, but now they are flowing out one after another and filling the market.</p>
<p>Tung oil: Yesterday, only Jiangbei gang absorbed Hongjiang oil, and the sales of other full-degree white oil, etc., were very narrow. In this situation, the market sentiment also continued to settle, and the selling prices of each item were on the original route, with white oil at 350 yuan per catty and Hongjiang oil at 400 yuan.</p>
<p>Tea: The trend is still popular, because 　demand buyers' appetite is still happy, so those who need cash flow in the middle are still plugging out, but there is no great stimulus. The quotations for red and green tea are each showing their colors, and by the time the market closes, the results are all much higher than the previous day's grinding price.</p>
<p>Rayon: With the gold market weak, it followed the trend and softened. It is estimated that 120 denier Tianqiao, the current buying price is 620,000, the selling price is 640,000, the warehouse receipt buying price is 475,000 yuan, the selling price is 50,000 yuan, and there are few other transactions, it is said.</p>
<p>Pharmaceuticals: The market is 　 falling, with saccharin at 26,500 yuan, quinine at 33,000 yuan, Bagua Dan at 1,650 yuan, and Wan Jin Oil at 1,800 yuan.</p>

<p>Short Talk</p>
<h3>A Chat About Free Talk</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiayin</p>
<p>After Free Talk could not be free, the editor went far away to Chongqing, to breathe the free air of the free zone. Now that the War of Resistance has been won and Shanghai has seen the light of day again, Shen Bao has resumed publication, and Free Talk has regained its freedom. The editor would like to take this opportunity to chat freely with all the old readers.</p>
<p>Today, newspapers have become an indispensable spiritual food for the people. I remember when I was in Chongqing, the editor went out for a walk one morning and saw a housewife who had just returned from the vegetable market. She was holding a full vegetable basket in one hand, and on top of the vegetables was a copy of the day's newspaper. Elevating the newspaper to the same level as daily food made a deep impression on the editor, who felt that in the past eight years of the War of Resistance, some places in China had indeed made progress.</p>
<p>The supplement is a supplementary reading material to the newspaper's news section, with the important mission of supplementing news reports, expanding readers' knowledge, and educating the public. Therefore, the editor feels that his responsibility is really not small. For the sake of the mission that a Mahayana supplement should have, I hope that all authors and readers will help a lot.</p>
<p>I think that a good spiritual food, like our daily food, must be hygienic, delicious, and at the same time nutritious. In other words, the writing in the supplement must have a clear and correct point of view in order to give readers a good influence. The writing in the supplement must be popular and interesting in order to arouse readers' interest in reading. But popular is by no means vulgar, and interesting does not necessarily have to be low-level. In addition, the writing in the supplement must be factual, so that readers can come into contact with reality, absorb its essence, and increase their knowledge.</p>
<p>In the future, Free Talk hopes to be based on the above simple principles. The editor hopes to provide the readers of Shen Bao with a hygienic, delicious, and nutritious spiritual food every day, and hopes that all writer friends will provide a lot of material.</p>
<p>Correspondence</p>
<h3>The Hearts of the People of the Northeast Have Not Died</h3>
<p>— Tian Mu</p>
<p>——Correspondence from Changchun</p>
<p>At 5:00 p.m. the day before Double Ten Day, the first plane carrying the personnel of the Northeast Headquarters of the Central Government arrived in Changchun, the land that had been occupied for fourteen years. The person who went to the airport to pick up the plane was General Garlov, the Soviet garrison commander of Changchun.</p>
<p>After the news of Japan's surrender was officially announced, the people of Northeast, who had endured it for fourteen years, exploded all at once. The people of Northeast, who were unwilling to be slaves to a conquered country, and the puppet Manchukuo army, had conflicts with the Japanese army that were not small. The incidents of ordinary people fighting the Japanese were also happening anytime and anywhere. It was not until August 18, when the Soviet army entered Changchun, that the conflict stopped. The officials of the puppet Manchukuo were arrested or fled. With the consent of the Soviet army, under the leadership of the Northeast Party Affairs Joint Office, a celebration victory conference and a temporary Changchun Special Municipal Government were established. The work of welcoming the National Army and maintaining local security had a destination at this time.</p>
<p>The roads in Changchun City are wide and flat. No matter whether they are Chinese or Japanese shops, they are not open for business. Therefore, the situation in the city is quite desolate.</p>
<p>The enthusiasm of the people of Changchun for welcoming the National Army is certainly at its extreme, and the Japanese also have great expectations for the National Army. The Japanese Residents Association also set up many wooden signs at important intersections, with slogans such as "Welcome the meritorious Central Army" and "Long live President Chiang."</p>
<p>There are not many Soviet troops seen on the streets, because they have been leaving one after another. However, there are still Soviet guards at important traffic intersections. The traffic command in the city is also handled by Soviet women's auxiliary teams. American-made Jeep cars and General Motors' ten-wheeled trucks are very common on the streets of Changchun, but the paint on the body is not the American white five-pointed star, but the Soviet red star. The traffic regulations in Changchun were originally on the left, but since the Soviet army moved in, they have been changed to the right. Datong Road has been renamed Stalin Road, and Datong Square has become Stalin Square. A monument to Soviet soldiers who died in battle is being rushed to completion in the square, with a deadline of the end of October. According to the Soviet side, they sacrificed more than 8,000 officers and soldiers in the war against Japan.</p>
<p>The Japanese, who used to consider themselves as emperors, are now drooping their heads and are in a mess. Since Japan surrendered and the puppet Manchukuo collapsed, the rations that were usually better than those of the Chinese have been stopped at the same time. At first, they could only eat a little food that they had hoarded, but then they had to set up street stalls and sell some of the things they could sell, and then exchange them for food from the Chinese. Now, some embarrassed Japanese people are already selling twists and fritters in Chinese fritter shops to maintain their lives.</p>
<p>Although the general Chinese people have suffered for fourteen years, when they go to the streets, everyone is very excited. When the Jilin Provincial Party Department invited the reception personnel to visit the party department at Sanmalu, the people surrounded the air force personnel so tightly that no water could leak through. Everyone shouted slogans such as "Long Live the Republic of China" and "Welcome the Central 　".</p>
<p>Because the formal reception has not yet begun, the currency in circulation in the city is still the banknotes of the puppet Manchukuo and the military tickets issued by the Soviet army. What I saw earlier were ten yuan and one hundred yuan, and the military tickets were only ten yuan. The general prices in Changchun are very low. A brand of cigarettes called Danggui, which is better than Huafu brand in Beiping, sells for only seven or eight yuan per pack. It is said that a woolen suit can be bought for about 2,000 yuan. However, because the reception personnel are not allowed to bring legal tender, and there is no legal tender circulating in the market at all, the exchange rate between legal tender and the current currency system has not yet been determined, so it is difficult to say whether things are expensive or cheap.</p>
<p>Many people may think that young people in the Northeast under the age of twenty will definitely not speak Chinese anymore, but that is not the case. I once talked with a sixteen-year-old young man for an hour or two. It is said that in the elementary school curriculum, the time spent on Japanese and Manchu (i.e., Mandarin) accounted for a ratio of three to one. The teachers were also three Japanese and one Chinese. Although you must speak Japanese at school, you still speak Mandarin and write Chinese characters when you go home. Although he is a sixteen-year-old child, his national and ethnic ideas are not lower than those of general primary and secondary school students in the rear. "China will not perish" is not just a casual remark. The people of the Northeast, who have been occupied for fourteen years, can serve as iron proof that "the hearts of the people have not died." It is said that after Japan surrendered, an old lady in her seventies said: "I am willing to die even if I see the flag of the blue sky and white sun hanging all over the street again!"</p>
<p>Because the Northeast, which has been occupied for fourteen years, can no longer find a national flag, the reception personnel specially brought a lot of national flags from Chongqing. When I was in Beiping, I saw that the streets were full of old flags from eight years ago, but when I arrived in Changchun, they were all brand new party and national flags. Even the doors of the Japanese are hung with a national flag and a Soviet flag.</p>
<h3>Preparation</h3>

<h3>New Hope</h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>——Congratulations on the Re-publication of Shen Bao——</p>
<p>If it is said that: "Ideal is the mother of fact," then, "Hope is the collection of success!" With the new situation of "Glorious Victory," there is a new hope of "Glorious Victory!" Since I received the good news of the re-publication of Shen Bao, I have been so happy that I cannot sleep! I think: the old Shen Bao, which was founded in the Tongzhi period, has a long and glorious history and has always held the authority of the journalistic world. Ask the women and children on the street, no one does not know the "old Shen Bao." Even hawkers and coolies all know the genuine and old-fashioned "old Shen Bao." Before the war, it was well-known, and after the war, it fell into the hands of the enemy and puppets, and readers did not sigh and regret it! Is it said that Shen Bao has no future? Is there no hope? But victory has come, and the demons have disappeared! Shen Bao has been re-published! Shen Bao has washed away the stale dregs and gained the new hope of new life! This new hope is full of vigor! This new hope contains the seeds for irrigating the new China! From brilliant and glorious, from radiant and colorful! The rejuvenated, brand-new, lively, vigorous old Shen Bao is meeting readers again in a new posture! I am full of ardent new hope for Shen Bao, and I will more enthusiastically support and wish Shen Bao eternal life with the spirit of loving to read and love to write as before the war!</p>
<h3>New Weapons of 1946</h3>
<p>— Yu Fan</p>
<p>During this war, mostly older weapons were used on the battlefield. However, behind the scenes, new weapons were constantly being researched and invented, inevitably leading future wars to the fantastical stage of "a push of a button, killing people thousands of miles away."</p>
<p>Now that the war is over, the U.S. Air Force Technical Research Department, in order to prevent many accomplishments from being buried in obscurity, recently opened an "Air Force Exhibition." The scale is grand, and the exhibits are diverse and beautiful. Some featured new weapons are as follows:</p>
<p>"Azon" is a type of radio-controlled bomb without a stack. The bomber can control the tail fins of the bomb, making it go left or right. It has already been used on the battlefields of Burma and Italy.</p>
<p>"Razon" is a radio and television-controlled gliding bomb. It glides for a distance of twenty miles, and within this range, radio commands can be used to make it move up, down, left, and right at will. The bomber observes the trajectory of the bomb on a television screen and directly commands it until it hits the target.</p>
<p>An aircraft engine with 5,000 horsepower (the engine of a Superfortress is only 2,500 horsepower).</p>
<p>An American-style V2 rocket.</p>
<p>Aircraft propellers that can rotate in opposite directions, and a propeller with reverse torsion, allowing giant aircraft to land on extremely short runways.</p>
<p>The vertical takeoff glider is a combination of a helicopter and a glider, weighing only fifty pounds. It is very suitable for a single person to carry and deploy behind enemy lines.</p>
<p>A three-lens aerial camera. A single photograph can capture from one end of the horizon to the other. There is also a new type of powerful searchlight for aerial reconnaissance photography at night.</p>

<h3>Scientific News</h3>
<p>— Chen Yin</p>
<p>Astronomers have used a specially made refracting telescope to discover a gigantic red planet, millions of times larger than our sun in volume, but so small in density that it is almost like a ball of empty red light.</p>
<p>According to recent scientists' estimates, the atmospheric layer on the moon is only one-millionth the mass of the atmosphere on Earth.</p>
<p>Recently, scientists predicted that the next peak period of sunspot expansion will occur earlier, before May 1948.</p>

<p>Short Masterpiece</p>
<h3>The Enemy (Part One)</h3>
<p>— Pearl S. Buck, translated by Zhu Qi</p>
<p>Foreword</p>
<p>During World War II, Shanghai readers did not see many famous foreign works. In the future, we plan to introduce some of these works in the "Free Talk" section. This article is a short masterpiece by the famous American female writer Pearl S. Buck, which won the 1943 American O. Henry Memorial Award. Ms. Buck grew up in China and became famous for her book "The Good Earth." In 1938, she won the Nobel Prize in Literature. This article tells the story of a Japanese doctor who studied in the United States and an American prisoner of war. The full text will be published in ten days. — Editor</p>
<p>Dr. Sadao Hoki's house was built on the seacoast of Japan, where he used to play as a child. This low, square stone house was built on a rock rising beside a narrow beach, lined with many bowing pine trees. As a child, Sadao often climbed these pine trees like he saw people in the South Seas climbing trees to pick coconuts, using his bare feet to climb. His father used to take him to those islands in the South Seas, and his father never forgot to tell this serious little boy beside him: "These islands in front are the stepping stones of Japan's future."</p>
<p>Sadao asked seriously: "Where are we going from here?"</p>
<p>His father replied: "Who knows? Who can limit our future? Our future depends entirely on ourselves to create."</p>
<p>Sadao remembered these words in his heart, just as he remembered everything his father said. His father never joked with him, never played with him, and painstakingly taught his only son. Sadao knew that his education was his father's greatest concern. For this reason, he was sent to the United States at the age of twenty-two to study surgery and medicine. He returned to his country at the age of thirty, and before his death, his father not only saw Sadao become a famous surgeon, but also a famous scientist. Because he is now completing an invention that can completely clean wounds, he was not sent overseas with the army. He also knew that the reason he was still able to stay in Japan was because the old general's illness might require surgery, and this illness is currently being treated with drugs.</p>
<p>The mist is rising from the sea. The unexpectedly warm days a few days ago caused a thick fog to rise from the cold waves at night. Sadao watched the fog obscure the outline of a small island near the shore, then climbed up the beach below the house, enveloping the pine trees. In a few minutes, this fog will envelop the house, and he will go inside, where his wife Hana and their two children are waiting for him.</p>
