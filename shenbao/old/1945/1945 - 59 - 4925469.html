<h3>呂宋一個半月中　日軍獲綜合戰果　殺傷敵方兵員七萬以上</h3>
<p>東京二十六日中央社電　呂宋島日軍地上部隊，自一月九日敵軍於仁牙因灣登陸以來，於山下大將指揮下，英勇奮戰，使敵登陸軍之損害日漸增加。自敵美軍登陸日起至二月二十三日止，在此一個半月中，日軍收獲之綜合戰果，僅以敵軍傷亡而言，已達七萬以上。茲誌其戰果如次：殺傷兵員七萬以上，破壞火砲四七〇門，截獲火砲一八門，損毀戰車及起火者二三五輛，焚毀各式車輛五四五輛，擊落並擊毀飛機九〇架以上，擊沉或擊毀艦船六〇艘，破壞其他舟艇二九艘，破壞及焚毀幕舍一〇〇以上，重機槍二五〇以上，載獲重機槍一三〇挺以上，戰果中並未加入於科列基多島及日航空部隊收獲之戰果，而班班地區方面，則爲二月十四日以前之戰果。</p>

<p>馬尼刺日軍　據大廈抵抗</p>
<p>里斯本二十七日中央社電　據馬尼刺前綫報消息，紐約新聞馬尼刺特派員二十六日晨報道如次：舊城內以外之另一部分日軍，特將巴西克河南部之議事堂。財務局。農商局等三大建築物築成堅固之要塞，繼續死鬥。此等建築物之屋頂及上部，於二週前已遭燒毀，日軍改在地下室巧妙一開築塹壕，該下室內部用鐵片洋灰所築之碉堡，置有電氣地雷陣，機關槍座。該特派員又對於馬尼刺市東方日軍之夾擊亦報吿稱，沿馬尼刺東方十英里之安得保魯東北方高地，美軍曾遭遇日軍英勇抗戰，該方面之日軍，據守强固塹壕，對美軍先遣部隊用重砲，迫擊砲，機關槍猛擊，美軍之進展已受阻。</p>

<h3>東亞民族應醒悟　奮起負保衛重責　敵美大陸反攻企圖難成功</h3>
<p>中央社訊　在硫黃島登陸之敵軍，兵員損失已近二萬，登陸作戰總司令塔那前亦會說明，惟日方並不以此而認爲敵軍攻勢因之減弱，吾人亦並不認爲對於敵人之現代作戰情况慘烈，然美國人力及物質上的貧乏，巳影響及其誇示之中國大陸接岸作戰，此固極爲明顯者·渝方發言人七日會見記者時，對於謠傳美軍在從印度駛往中國之運輸部隊中使用黑人，渝方表示反對一說力加否認，由此事實，可以證明美軍以大部隊運抵中國大陸，進行對日長期作戰，乃屬不可能，故有使用黑人之計劃。彼等企圖自已幹部棠握指揮權，而驅使渝軍及黑人軍供其犧牲對日作戰，此於美國言，利用中國土地與人力對日作戰，是大東亞戰爭勃發以來的一貫野心，現重慶高呼大陸總反攻，此亦即美國之對日反攻，目的當然在使渝方屈從其支配，重慶抗戰歷時八年，去春日軍進行大陸縱貫大作戰後，渝方戰力受重大打擊，即渝方亦自承認，現重慶屢次企圖整理雜軍，但在今日，依然由地方軍占優勢，再從其戰鬥力觀，可能對日作戰奢約占全兵力二分之一以下，故對日反攻難以成功，查去年大陸作戰，敵交戰五力約一百師，其中遭擊減者十五師，喪失半數以下者四十五師，須加整理者二十三師，其在人力上的損耗約七十萬，相當於五十師兵力，又在物資上的損耗，如兵器彈藥等喪失約三萬噸，且重要資源生產地區桂林，柳州及湖南，慶東等軍火製造地帶及農礦資源地區，亦喪失無餘。估計渝軍每年平均損耗，除戰傷逃亡外，大致民國三十年二十三萬人，三十一年二十一萬人，三十二年二十四萬人，三十三年七十萬人，此種損耗用如何方法彌補，爲渝方認爲最感頭痛者，但爲補充每年損失之兵力，不得不節滅戰略單位，於是企圖使軍隊成爲美國化，並改自裝備以補兵員之不足，編組目標約二百師至三百師，一俟編竣，立即開始對日反攻，渝方之動員二十萬知識靑年從軍運動，其目的亦在於此。此外，並謀改善軍人待遇，補充彈藥，然美軍在中國大陸登陸，是否爲中國之福，美國戰爭目的在「獲得本國工業之海外市塲」，彼使世界陷於混亂，此爲一面動干戈，一面談和平之兩重人格之侵略。美國最近微妙的對華政策·始終把持重慶，冀圖全面利用中國總力，而對日反攻，彼目的使中國人供其犧牲，誠如美國方面之所言，重慶已無幸福可言，所有者爲惡性通貨膨賬興民衆之貧困。重慶開始對日總反攻之一天，即是中國引起大混亂之時，亦即抗戰中國崩潰之一日，開戰以來，已歷織年，全東亞民族應立即醒悟，不受盎格魯撒克遜民族陰謀之誘惑，奮起負擔保衛東亞之重任。</p>
<h3>日眾院定三月　再召集會議　昨開協議會一致贊成</h3>
<p>東京二十七日中央社電　日衆議旣自二月八日自然休會後，茲鑒於時局緊急，希望再開議會之聲浪頗高，因此特於二十七日上午假院內議長應接室召開議院協議會，檢討再開議會之問題，結果全體一致贊成，均認爲應再開議，曾以緊急之實施各項決戰施策，幷要求政府報吿因實施强力政治所獲之戰况，同時，再質問政府之自信等事項。至於再開議會之時期及方法，則決定再度（開會議之後，即致電硫黃島將兵，用表感激及激勵之意，又再開一項復須斟酌政府情形及翼政會之態度，時期約在三月上旬。</p>
<h3>日郵政貯金　飛躍增加</h3>
<p>東京二十七日中央社電　日昭和二十年度之全國貯金額爲四百十億圓，其中一部份數目係郵政貯金，每月已形飛躍增加，尤其去年九月至十月展開定額貯金增强運動後，已增加至十一億七千萬圓，更自十二月實施決戰儲蓄强調運動後，至一月已增加十五億五千萬圓，至此昭和十九年度之郵政貯金增加月標額入十八億圓，已於十個月中完成。自該年度開始以來至二月中旬止，其純增加額累計共達百億圓之鉅，若與前年度同期間之增加額五十億圓相比，實已超躍二倍，現在之郵政貯金達二百九十億圓，故不久即將突破三百億圓。</p>
<h3>陳實長來滬　視察經濟情況</h3>
<p>南京二十七日中央社電　國府自頒佈物價對策緊急措置後，實長陳君慧氏爲明瞭上海一般經濟情形及反響如何，業於日前赴滬視察。</p>
<h3>渝民船公司　營業不振</h3>
<p>廣州二十七日中央社電　重慶治下之經濟，由於物價飛漲，漫無止境，其煩惱益感深刻。頃重慶政權與民間合資經營之民船公司，因受物價騰貴影響，去年度一年內該社之營業狀况，虧損二億餘元，傳渝府若不設法補救，則將來之營業更有深刻之困難。據該社民國三十三年度營業報吿，燃料較事變前高漲達五百五十倍，船舶修建必要之鋼板，達二千一百八十二倍，食米五百三十八倍，其物價高漲極爲驚人，因此收支失去平衡，渝當局亦吿東手無策云。</p>
<h3>行政院會議通過　農業增產案　經費部份已重編預算</h3>

<h3>克里米亞會議　分割德土計劃</h3>
<p>瑞典京城二十七日中央社電　海通社訊，倫敦觀察報載稱：克里米亞會議決定分割德國之土地，在萊茵河西岸建立一國，名爲獨立，而實際由反軸心所控制，並將上西里西亞割與波蘭。</p>
<h3>慕尼黑遭空襲　著名敎堂中彈</h3>
<p>柏林二十七日中央社電　海通社訊：星期日慕尼黑被炸時，該城之著名富勞恩敎堂之尖塔中彈，聖彼得堂及新市政廳亦受重創。</p>
<h3>西綫攻防戰　進入第二階段　杜倫要城已化爲廢墟</h3>
<p>柏林二十七日中央社電　海通社訊：繆斯河與伊斐爾間，敵開始大量使用坦克，艾森霍華將軍之攻勢，似已進入第二階段。蓋在敵軍攻勢之初起三日內，步砲兵尙未能造成大缺口，以供坦克之湧入，敵步兵損失之慘重，使其坦克軍不得不出動衝鋒。扼守魯爾河綫之德軍以完成任務，乃退守較後之第二道防綫，美軍坦克今已被阻於此第二道防綫前。</p>
<p>蘇黎世廿七日中央社電　德軍現據有科隆平原前方要衝杜倫市之東部，對自北方及南方突入市內之美軍續行猛擊，但至二十五日，該化爲廢墟之市終爲美軍所佔領。</p>
<p>柏林二十七日中央社電　海通社訊：繆斯及魯爾區艾森霍華所發動之攻勢，目的在以鉗形姿態，分自萊因河左岸之南北推進，以圖使杜倫·科隆一綫以北之德軍陷於孤立。杜倫與林尼許間，美第九第一軍繼續向孟深·格拉特巴許。杜塞爾社夫及科隆推進，然進展殊少，僅於林尼許之兩側，美軍抵魯爾河東六七公里之處，德軍乃於杜倫。紐斯公路之兩側，建立新防綫從事反攻。杜倫科隆公路上，蘇軍在杜倫東四千公尺處，大致而論，西綫大戰至第四日仍爲流動之塹濠戰，德軍以輕微之損失，到處防止敵軍突入，魯爾全綫自魯爾蒙特以至杜倫，仍在德軍砲火不斷轟炸之下。</p>
<h3>薩爾堡週圍惡戰進行中</h3>
<p>柏林二十七日中央社電　海通社訊：薩爾河下游，美軍新坦克車隊已抵達，並將薩爾堡兩側之橋頭堡聯絡完成，德軍反攻阻其橋頭堡擴展，有數處德軍且獲進展。</p>
<h3>英法談判　締結同盟</h3>
<p>瑞典京城二十七日中央社電　德國社訊，據美聯社報吿：法外長畢多爾特近與英外相艾登曁英首相邱吉爾討論多時，此項討論可視爲英法正式談判同盟條約之開始，其最嚴重之問題，厥爲敍利亞曁黎巴嫩拒絕繼續允法享受特權，衆信英將要求法方承認該二小國之獨立，倘法不願放棄其代領國之地位，則英法同盟協定之成立，恐將延期。</p>
<h3>法閣批准美法協定</h3>
<p>洛賽尼二十七日中央社電　德國社訊，巴黎消息：特戈爾內閣已完全批准如美政府所建議之法美協定，在此協定之下，美國將以價値約三十萬萬美金之貨物租借與法國，包括純粹軍事性質之供應品，與改造所用之輸入品，關於此事，官方發表文吿稱：運至北非與法國之供應品，不久將付以美金五萬萬元，此項付款將由被美財部所凍結之法國資金約二十萬萬美金項下支出。</p>
<h3>羅京發生騷亂　全國戒嚴</h3>
<p>里斯本二十七日中央社電　據羅京電稱：二十四日上午布加勒斯特市內及羅馬尼亞各地發生騷亂，市民結夥襲擊王宮，首相及內長官邸警察局等處發動騷擾，因此羅馬尼亞鎭壓之軍隊，遂對羣衆發砲射擊。據巴黎電稱，至二十五日僅布加勒斯特市內騷擾未停，國內各都市亦具呈惡化傾向，羅政府乃決定頒布全國戒嚴令</p>
<p>瑞典京城二十七日中央社電　德國社訊，倫敦消息：羅馬尼亞現時局勢，已頗似希臘內戰發生前之險况。</p>
<h3>特別法庭滬分庭　暫行組織條例　判決死刑者得執行槍決</h3>
<p>南京二十七日中央社電　中樞當局爲適應上海特殊需要，經國防會議通過設立特別法庭上海分庭，茲經制定暫行組織條例如左：</p>
<p>國民政府特別法庭上海分庭暫行組織條例（卅四年二月二十七日公佈）</p>
<p>第一條，凡在上海特別市區域內犯左列各罪，不論其身份如何，得由上海特別市市長呈請國民政府以命令交特別法庭上海分庭審判之：（一）危害民國緊急治罪法第一條至第六條各罪。（二）公務員犯贓治罪條例第一條至第六條各罪。（三）戰時刑事特別法第一條至廿三條各罪。（四）囤積主要商品治罪條例第一條至第三條及第五條至第七條各罪。（五）刑法第三百三十九條至一百四十條，及三百四十六條至第三百四十八條各罪。</p>

<p>第九條，本條例自公布之日施行。</p>
<h3>東綫南北翼　德防禦戰成功　爭奪勞班展開坦克大戰</h3>
<p>柏林二十七日中央社電　海通社訊：德軍昨在東綫南北兩端，獲得兩大成就，即南路格蘭區蘇攻勢計劃之被擊破，以及東普魯士德軍擊潰蘇軍三軍之主力是也。德軍在薩姆蘭（東普魯士）恢復通至康尼斯堡之海道及公路鐵路交通，實頗具重要性。柯蘭區（拉特維亞東部）第五次戰役中蘇軍仍未能克服德軍之抵抗。東錢中路蘇將蘇柯夫元帥尙未發動攻勢，現正從事推動其南北兩翼，以與中路相並。北翼之德軍已放棄安斯瓦特，而南翼富爾斯登堡及勞班區又起激戰。哥尼夫元帥之先鋒直抵古本及福斯特附近始被阻，惟有蘇橋頭堡數座則爲德軍擊潰。</p>
<p>柏林二七日中央社電　海通社訊：下西里西亞之勞班城（lauban）現發生坦克大戰，勞班爲攻擊柏林之要點，昨日德軍當局盡力堅守，並堵合一突破點，數日來德蘇坦克車進行流動戰，有數處曾易手數次。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>政治之連鎖性</h3>
<p>政治之機構宛如一有機體，各部分息息相通，各部分亦休戚相依。今以人體爲喻，兩手麻痺而兩足健碩，軀幹萎縮而肢體發達，殆皆不可能之事，縱能之亦不過成爲一種畸形而非全體之福，必也使五官百骸各部分平均發展而各部分互相聯系，庶幾能臻正常健全之境。</p>
<p>上海市政府之下，計有三十單位（參閱本報本月十日「上海市政欄」第一期及第二期連續登載之「市府機構述要」一文　最近雖有裁併者然同時亦有增設者，故　數上無大更變。），此猶人之五官百骸也。欲求整個市政府健全非使各單位健全不可，蓋秘書處之一舉一動足以影響各局各區公署各縣政府，財政局之措施足以影響其他各單位之業務。此外各單位之間又復相互作用，例如地政局之與財政局，警察局之與經濟局，工務局（現與公用局合併改稱爲建設局）之與衛生局等等，彼此無不如脣齒之相依。甲單位之工作有待於乙單位之協助，或乙單位之成績又復爲丙單位事業之基礎。有如機器之齒輪必須互相嵌緊，有如動物之指臂不容彼此脫節。單位愈繁夥愈難協調，組織愈龐大愈難指揮，其故在此。現市政當局已注意機構之簡單化，則宜將全盤組織加以有系統之檢討，而確定一公允的必要的裁撤合併或增設。更當在可能範圍推進合署辦公制，不特可省去若干總務文書人事統計等重複之組織，以及行文訪謁電話之煩瑣，抑且精神集中效率增加，並易於調度易於觀摩，各單位得由於互相比較互相競爭遂各求其健全之道，而無「天高皇帝遠」各自爲政各不相謀之弊。</p>
<p>上海市政府之對於中央，猶如肢體之對於首腦，肢臉固宜求共本身之健全與發達，但不能脫離首腦而解決其本身之問題。足痛則以手撫之，左手癢則以右手搔之，背後受敵則必轉身而以拳向之，此皆首腦之作用而有裨於各肢體之安全者。今言治理上海改造上海建設上海，則上海市政府首當其衝責無旁貸，但千頭萬緒條理紛繁，其中一部分應山地方政府且可由地方政府解決者，例如內部之整飭，市鄕之治安，財政之整理等，皆在市政府權限之內，確乎有心必有力，成效僅時間問題。至若物資之支配，運輸之圓滑，動力之增減等等，則皆出於市政府權限之外，似乎有心難有力，成效更無把握。有心必有力者宜盡其心力而爲之，而有心難有力者則應向中央報吿請示，使獲得有力之辦法而後巳。蓋中央應有其通盤之計劃，亦應有其對內對外交涉挹注之威權，更應有解決一省一市本身所不能解決者之決心與能力。否則談不到治理上海，談不到改造上海，更談不到建設上海。</p>

<h3>硫黃島中部激戰　日軍繫碎敵攻勢　地熱原一帶已成大廝殺塲</h3>
<p>東京二十七日中央社電　硫黃島之敵軍登陸部隊，自二十三日於日軍陣地前遭受日軍猛烈反繫後，其進展已完全遭受阻止，故敵軍爲求打開此膠着狀態，自廿五日傍晚，敵海上部隊對日軍主要陣地復終夜展開熾烈之艦砲射繫，至二十六日晨，敵登陸部隊藉艦砲及轟炸之掩護，並以多數之重輕迫繫砲對全戰綫開始大攻勢，是以敵軍欲一舉打開數日來之膠着戰綫。此外，摺鉢山方面之日軍部隊主力，二十三日夜突破新陣地，二十四日夜終於與主陣地會合，敵軍在摺鉢山之海兵三師圍，遂迂迴日軍陣地，目下敵軍以西部正面之第五師團，正面之第四師團以及第三師麗，對日這主要陣地開始大攻勢，故敵軍攻繫重點，依然在中央部地熱原及元山飛機塲。日軍至二十四日夜，使摺鉢山守備隊與主要陣地合體，以全力展開大反攻，於是硫黃島現正以地熱原，元山飛機塲滑走路交又點爲中心，西部至城門附近，南部至屏風山南側一帶戰綫，已成爲一大廝殺塲矣。</p>
<p>東京二十七日中央社電　敵美之急於攻破硫黃島，內心焦躁異常，敵似欲一舉而繫滅該島，徵諸敵登附後被日軍截獲之文書內容，即可知敵軍之計劃，在以四日爲期，繫破日軍防衛，以謀控制全島，然登陸後之實際戰鬥，却反乎敵之逆料，敵流血逐日增多，因此不得進展之敵軍，乃於二十五日出動艦載械及B29型機，聯合轟炸日本本土，同時對於硫黃島亦一齊展開總攻，敵之行動頗爲活潑，在兩軍對峙綫上，阿蘇台地熱原問之敵軍，一時曾集合戰車約八十輛，此外，並漸次庥結兵力，更出動五十餘架之空車協力，當時遊航於近海中之艦砲射繫，亦復趨熾烈。對此積極之總攻，日軍守備部隊當即集中砲火猛繫，於是敵之初步攻勢全被繫碎，是日傍晚，敵攻勢全部停頓，二十五日傍晚，兩軍之對時綫幾無變化可言，日軍現仍固守屏風台中央飛機塲南端及地熱原一帶陣地。</p>
<p>中部太平洋基地二十六日中央社電　硫黃島日軍守備隊，連日連夜繼續血鬥，屢使敵軍出血，二十四日戰况更加劇烈，敵軍攻勢雖形活躍，然戰况依然無大變化。企圖佔領第二飛機塲之有力敵軍，自下午一時五十分左右，以戰車六十四輛爲先鋒，由西方侵入，其一部突入元山方面之晶軍陣地之一角，其他部隊亦向屏風山方面進犯，日軍守備部隊對此正奮勇邀繫，於薄暮展開逆襲，雙方短兵相接，下午八時二十分，呼應日軍地上守備隊勇戰之日海軍航空隊，反覆猛烈轟炸敵陣地，遠處可以望見四處火光冲天。</p>
<p>美機再襲澳門</p>
<p>東京二十六日中央社電　敵美空軍曾於一月十六日盲炸葡屬澳門後，突於二十五日上午十時五十五分左右，復以P24型機數架來襲澳門，對市內繁華街道及碼頭附近，反覆婦射，更對已拿馬國籍之運輸船同樣加以婦射，葡蕭船員十人同受重傷。</p>
<h3>英帝國的苦悶</h3>
<p>「與其和過去所無的賢明事，毋寗作昔時已有的蠢事。」巴爾福的箴言，是英國內政外交的金科玉律。</p>
<p>開戰以來，英國外交的最大目的，端在節約自己的力量，利用他國繼續戰爭，由此可推想英國內政的最大問題，何以是使國民及殖民地大衆爲某種目標而戰了。英國的戰爭目的，似乎是在打倒聽國；實際上，在鄧扣克慘敗德軍進攻英國本土的可能性極大時，單就此點而言，固已理由充足，但此後的情勢，對英國多少有些好轉，何故仍非打倒德國不可呢？英國國民和殖民地由此可以得到什麼呢？這當然是須解釋的問題。</p>
<p>爲何而戰</p>
<p>這個須從英國遂行戰爭機構內誰握指導權的問題說起。英國政界表面上雖因政治休戰而彌縱裂　（參見二月二十五日本報週刋所戴「大英帝國之破產白皮書」），可是各當幹部問旣不打算提携，而下層勢力也無意完全舍作，在戰爭中擴大勢力的勞動階級，遇有機會即要求發言，希冀可能的話即代保守勢力而起，膠得政權。因此，抑止他們，成爲邱吉爾等的重要課題。此事若不成功，爲何面戰便成不可理解的事了。</p>
<p>最近，英國政界由於歐戰將近終同的樂觀論調，業已間始討論下次總選舉的時期及各黨在那時應取的態度，大體於各黨間政治休戰消滅及工黨勢力仲張不能阻抑時，以邱吉爾爲中心的保守黨應該用何種方策來對付，似爲其中心問題。</p>
<p>英國之夢</p>
<p>因此，爲振作本國民衆的戰意，使忍受戰爭的負擔起見，英國政府不得不描摹舊薇色的美夢，力說必須由戰爭來建設世界。鄧相克慘敗以後，曾幾何時，英國「經濟學家」雜誌於一九四〇年夏便說：「國石油輸出國組織對於每個國民，保證充分供給食糧·衣服·居信及其他一般承認的生活必需品的時期，確已到來。」正如該雜誌自己承認，這種議論不過代表「並不怎樣新鮮的。當時一般通行的思想」而已。在前次大戰後大感失望的英國民衆，大約從這次戰爭初時起，就熱烈希望不再重受如此痛苦的經騐吧。</p>
<p>牛津大學敎授威廉。皮伐立茲勳爵，受英國政府的委託，着手擬訂社會保險計畫，硏究的結果，遂於一九四二年十二月發表所謂皮伐立茲社會保險案。該案爲不用「布爾雪維克的方法」，一婦國內的「窮乏」起見，使一切市民「生活上。職業上遭遇各種危機時，保證獲得農低限度的金錢收入」爲目的。</p>
<p>內政糾紛</p>
<p>皮伐立茲案於一九四三年二月交下院審議，工黨急進派熱烈主張即時實施該安及創設社會保險部，但政府力持有進一層研究的必要，即時實施的提議不吿定。爲了這問題，工黨內部亦發生裂　，急進派甚至要求黨籍閣員引退，一時令人岌岌危懼，後經黨幹部拼命幹旋，總算緩和下去。</p>
<p>其後，英政府雖未正式過分觸及國內戰綫問題，唯似仍在準備循皮伐立茲案的路綫作成代替的方案。迨一九四四年九二十六日，果用白皮書發表政府的社會保障計畫案，英政府對於戰後國內經營的方針，由此大體顯露。</p>
<p>集皮伐立茲案之「精華」面成的英政府社會保障案，究竟是怎樣的東西呢？簡言之，即打算由極其廣汎的社會保險，來保障全體人民在失業、年老、疾病、受傷等時的最低生活的計畫。此案對於家族津貼，疾病與失業救濟金，習藝津貼，自營者疾病救濟金，家族膽養津貼，退職恩給，分娩補助金，寡婦扶助金，一般恩給，託孤救濟金，寡婦恩給，營奶補助金等，均有詳細的規定。唯從根本觀念而言，與戰前的失業保險制度並無大異，不過是勞動階級在平時付出定額的保險費，再加上本家和政府的補助金，以圖取得「社會的安定」而已。</p>
<p>空頭支票</p>
<p>以上就是英政府入在國民眼前的「戰後新世界」。這個毫不新鮮，顯然根據着英國傳統的「布施」的觀念。不過，即使並不新鮮，只要能如願得到「社會的安定」，那末也算是目的已達了。這個政府案在英國政界經濟界各方面，已成爲議論的對象，由此判明種種事實，其中最可注目的是：工相貝文曾在下院宣布戰後失業者不致超過英國全體勞工的八％。由此以觀，這個不良分子案似乎是根據失業者在八％以下的推定而作成的，倘若超過這百分比率，預定的參見算額八億三千一百萬鎊勢必不敷，結果捨增加保險費或削滅甚至中止支付金額以外，別無解決的辦法。事實上，在英國上院內，由實施政府案面起的負担，將非英國民衆所能勝任的義論，，似甚有力。另一方面，原案所定每週二十四先令的失業津貼，工黨方面尙且非常不滿，憤憤然高呌「使歸還兵士幻滅吧」，茍再削減或中止支付款項，則此「黃金鄕」的美夢必將毀於一旦。再則，政府案修訂皮伐立茲案，對於疾及失業保險金，各限於三年及三十星期內交付，且規定社會保險的實施須待「現在的戰爭終了以後」，關於這幾占，似乎也有深刻的不滿存在。</p>
<p>前途黯淡</p>
<p>與政府的白皮書相對，皮伐立茲又新發表「完全僱傭案」，申論振興輸出乃是完全僱傭不可缺少的前提。這眞是扼要的議論。要之，不論皮伐立茲案也好，政府案也好，若不預定恢復英國所有某種種度的經濟繁榮，便不會成立。這是也可從戰前失業保險的經騐得到的結論吧。然則，戰後英國的經濟，復興能希望到什麼程度呢？</p>
<p>英帝國經濟繁榮，不，經濟存立的根抵，不外乎貿易，海運，海外投資三項。此三項在這次大戰中均已日趨沒落。英國喪失其「世界之工廠」的地位，固爲夙昔的事情，而自此次開戰以來，世界各地英貨市塲，無論印度呀·澳洲呀·中國呀·南美呀·沒有一處沒有美貨的推銷。尤其因美國已從英國取得一紙英國不再輸出租軍物資或同類物資的保證，英國的輸出貿易顯然更加受阻礙了。依據最近成立的美英新租借協定此條約固已撤廢，然而租軍物資却也同時減半了。英政府於一九國四年十一月二十日發表的白皮書，表明如下的事實，即一九三八年至一九四三年間，英國的輸出貿易減少到一半以下，一九四三年度的輸出總値，僅佔國民純收入的二·八％，顯然比一九三八年的一〇·二％低下。</p>
<p>海外貿易</p>
<p>英國戰後能够恢復這些市塲嗎？今日，英國能生產的商品中，在國際市場上有眞正價値者，極少極少。蘭開夏的紡織工廠，以及昔日無與倫比的孟却斯德　鋼業，現在均比美德蘇等遜色。僅銀製品·毛織物·金剛鎭·無線電·農產加工品·馬匹·麻布等商品，尙可和他國爭一日之長。英帝國自治領殖民地工業在戰時迅速進展，固爲事實，唯此益使英國的立場不利。在租借武器的形武下欠了美國龐大的値款，而所有市場又於戰時因美貨的銷行而日形狹隘的英國，不論單爭在怎樣的形式下結束，戰後必將陷於極度的苦境。正如斯麥資所說，戰後的英國將「在經濟上非常貧乏」。</p>
<p>戰前，英國從海運業及海外投資所得的收入，列於貿易外的收益項下，用以彌補入超而有餘。蓋其本國貿易雖然不振，爲貨物運輸者的英國商船隊，却揚起了英國轟，世界各大港口幾乎沒有一個無其蹤跡。可是，出於戰時消耗的龐大及美國造船業的迅速發展，戰後英國如有一千萬噸，則美國恐怕有約略三倍於此的商船。至於商業航空，可說亦復相同；美國今日就已經在使用英國屬有的基地，徐徐蠶食英國的商業航空路。</p>
<p>遺產蕩盡</p>
<p>貿易和海運雖則如此凋零，如果尙餘戰前誇稱世界第一的海外投資，那末，英國或許還有重建對外經濟的可能。多年累積的海外投資，乃是大英帝國過去繁榮時代的遺產，正因有此，英國才能安然渡過以往的許多危機。可是，對於英國重要無異命根的海外投資，在這次戰爭裏却消耗得比什麼都利害。</p>
<p>戰前據稱約有五十億鎊，單是利息一項每年即達在一億鎊的英國海外投資中，估計約有人億鎊已毀於兵賽或爲日德兩國所沒收，其餘約三十二億鎊則作爲戰費而消耗殆盡。此外，開戰以來，又對自治領殖民地負債約十三億鎊，至於對美債務，縱然扣除抵補部分，據說亦達三十五億鎊左右；總而言之，英國在這次戰爭中幾已蕩盡戰前的海外投資。當然，英國自有將來如何減輕對於自治領及美國的債務的盤算，不過，英國以大債權國的身份君臨世界金融界的時代總已過去了，今後戰爭越拖得長，英國也越難自拔債務國的地位。英政府十一月二十八日發表的「破產白皮書」也自動暴露英國在五年的戰爭中已經蕩盡「宜父時代以來財賽的大半」的事實。而其輸出貿易及海運業又陷於前述的狀態中，戰後欲圖恢復迄今今所失的海外投資，可謂絕無可能。</p>
<p>英國將來</p>
<p>茵格在題「英國之將來」的論文中，曾將上面的事態表現如次：</p>
<p>「爲世界工廠的英國地位，早成明日黃化。英國的勞動力不獨昂貴，其工作能率亦未見向上。英國曾將龐大的款項貨予各國，結局使各國建立可以和英國工業競爭的工業。由此種借款所取得的利息，雖然稍有裨益於平衡，可是今日，借給外國的本金已將如數拔還，而英國爲了贍養其繁衍的人口，捨輸出僅有的一點擴物資源，以及今日所能衝破高關稅壁壘的工業製品外，另無他術。降出各國經濟上的國家主義以外，英國的對外貿易，由於國內生產成本及公共負担可怖　地增大，亦已陷於半身不遂的狀態。」、</p>
<p>茵格的論文裁於一九四三年五月的英國雜誌「兩週刋」上，他從以上的事態得到一個結論，即：「英國人口過多，將來達二千萬人」。正如這位保守派率直所承認的，英國經濟的現毒藥亟求減低「勞動力價格」，像社會保障案所描寫的那種安居樂業時代，毫無可以料其出現的根據。這一點，不論戰爭的前途擇取那一個方向，就英國而論，簡直是已經決定了的命運。然而爲了給與英國民衆虛妄的希望，使他們繼續從事戰爭起見，反而不得不揭出類乎提高「勞動力價格」的社會保障案這一塊招牌。</p>
<p>病人膏盲</p>
<p>貝文工相稱皮伐立茲案爲「救護車」。據「經濟學家」雜誌註解：「因救護車僅於出事時必要也。」據此以觀，可見「經濟學家」也承認已經「出事」了，唯故意無視英國經濟已患半身不遂的的沉疴而已。再者，此蘭救護車外表雖佳，內容却不堪一顧，反有加重病人病勢的可能性。何况能否駛抵「出事」地點就已大可懷疑了。</p>
<p>不過，英國當然不甘東手待斃，將用盡一切手段來殺出一條血路，直到最後始已。這將是英國國內外政策的基調吧。（譯自第廿五卷第五十一號同盟世界週報）</p>
<h3>敵美飛機盲炸漢口慘狀</h3>

<p>陳理事日平詞</p>
<p>行禮後，首由新協會滬分會陳常務理事日平致詞，略謂：「本日爲中國新聞協會上海區分會所主辦之靑年記者訓練班學員畢業典禮，承各位長官及各界之愛護，更在百忙中撥冗蒞臨參加，不勝感幸。關於訓練班詳情，將由敎務主任詳爲報吿，希望各位不吝指導。」</p>
<p>敎務主任報告</p>
<p>次爲朱敎務主任報吿云：「靑年記者訓練班籌設之動機，始於去年四月間，其目的在對現任新聞工作人員，予以再訓練。迨至六月一日，訓練班即正式成立，當時有各報社保送之學員，共計五十名，惟嗣因學員多數以職務上之變動或派遣至外埠服務，因此人數日漸減少，遂由前上海新聞聯合會理事會議議決，加委本人主持敎務，乃竭力整頓，並向外界招生，連同原有各生受訓，至今適足六個月，共計畢業學生三十名，至於敎務方面，着重專業訓練，將原有新聞研究科目外，再增加印務，採訪，法制等課，經四閱月之訓練，一個月之實習，今　圓滿畢業之期，尙望各生繼續努力，將來爲新聞事業創一新頁。」</p>
<p>發給畢業證書</p>
<p>繼由新協會會長李思浩氏（陳日平先生代）頒發證書，由學生黃嘉祿代表受領，儀式簡單隆重。</p>
<p>陳理事長致詞</p>
<p>又次爲新協會滬分會陳理事長致詞云：「新聞事業在中國還很幼稚，實爲人才之缺乏，故本會首重新聞人才之培養，報社新聞人才多，則其報社必發達，一個國家新聞人才多亦然。例如事變以前的大公報，特別注重人才，網羅人才，如張季彎，胡政之，吳鼎昌，王芸生等，均專心致力，以事業爲重，因此，大公報成爲全國新聞事業中領袖地位。又如最近新聞報因有新進人才參加工作，內容版式面目一新。至於做新聞記者的修養，我有三點意見貢獻：（一）須有興趣，有興趣即有精神，（二）技術及經騐之豐富，（三）嚴正之立塲。如此一個記者，至少被人家歡迎，而不使人家發生厭惡。今天是靑年記者訓練班畢業的一天，但兄弟平時毫無貢獻，這應當感謝平時負責訓導的各位先生。」</p>
<p>劉宣傳處長詞</p>
<p>宣傳處長劉德煊氏詞云：「中國新聞協會上海區分會舉辦之靑年記者訓練班成立的一天，我曾參加，今天舉行畢業禮，我又得參與，這使我非常欣幸的。在以往六個月中，靑年記者訓練班，羅致了上海一般優秀靑年，予以新聞應有的基本訓練，確曾費去了極多的精力，由此可見各位理事及諸位敎師之苦心舉劃，是値得慶賀的。現在諸位已經畢業，更將被派遣往各報社服務，從此所負之使命及責任，更爲重大，因此我希望各位能從發揚文化整頓人心及爲國爭光這三點做去，庶不負請位理事與敎師之提携及苦心。」</p>
<p>松本大尉致詞</p>
<p>艦隊報道部松大尉致詞云：「今日爲靑年記者訓練班畢業之期，諸君經六月之訓練，至今屆滿，本人深爲諸君慶賀，目下之戰事業已進入決戰之階段，故諸君所負之責任異常重大，諸君之畢業，對上海報紙與整個民族之發展，實有密切之關係，本人對諸君期望頗厚，深願諸君努力。」</p>
<p>李權時氏致詞</p>
<p>李權時致詞云：「訓練班爲各大報館所主持，本人所辦經濟日報，雖爲一小型報，但具有大報風格，故亦冒眛參與盛會，而更被請上台演講，更爲意想不到的事。古人說：「一言可以喪邦」，但反面言之，一語也可以興邦的，辦新聞事業就如此，共一字一言皆直接影響社會大衆，辦好可以興邦，辦壞就足以喪邦，故辦報乃以大衆利益爲前提，而社會國家以至整個世界，亦莫不受其影響。辦報應做於人有益之事，而新聞記者爲實際從事者，故更應以此爲重。俗語曰：「國家興亡，匹夫有責，」報人一枝筆就有此種使國家興衰的力址。譬如作安定民生之報道，可以使米價跌落，反之，就會使米價暴漲。報章內容，桃色題材雖不足取，但採取幽默滑稽不傷大雅輕鬆的筆調，亦是可取的。俗語常以刀筆相稱，故刀下留情即筆下留情，願各位學員在筆下努力，爲社會國家謀幸福。」</p>
<p>魯風理事致詞</p>
<p>次爲魯理事風致謝詞：「今天是中國新聞協會上海區分會主辦之靑年記者訓練班舉行畢業典禮，承各位來賓各位長官曁新聞界前輩賭先生參加，其感榮幸。又承本市宣傳處劉處長，盟邦松本大尉，經濟學者權威李權時先生，分別致詞，更不勝感激。鄙人從事新聞事業，十餘年以來，對中國新聞事業深抱極大之熱誠與悲哀。熱誠的是近來中國新聞事業，已有相當的進步，而悲哀的是中國新開事業雖有進步，但在整個世界進步的潮流中，還是彬龢先生所說的人才問題，即記者人才的缺乏，故陳先生發起開辦記者訓練班，發掘新的人才，鄙人自然是非常贊成的。</p>
<p>關於記者人才問題，在現今我國新聞界情形中，我有兩點意見：（一）我國新聞記者其中固有許多對新聞事業有很大的貢獻，推動新聞事業，有飛躍的進展，但能始終從事報紙工作的則很少。往往在新聞界稍有成就，便中途轉變退出新聞界，進入政治界做官去了。這在記者本身因生活獲得改善，可以說是得到較高的成就，但以整個新聞事業來講，是極大的損失，此種現象，自有其歷史的與社會的原因存在，但我總認爲是病態的。</p>
<p>（二）是我國從事新聞事業者，到了相當年齡之後，往往自身不再求進步，此類情形在別國極少。譬如日本諸大報館內有服務至五六十年之久而還是不斷苦幹求進步的人，而中國則不然，一有年齡的記者，大都已不再爲新聞事業打算，僅在顧全個人的生活問題了。因之形成中國新聞事業進步的牛步化，爲要補救這兩個缺點，我認爲唯有培養新的人才，以新陳代謝的法則，新的生長，老與陳腐的淘汰，使我國新聞日求進步起來。</p>
<p>靑年記者訓練班，我始終主張實際，不尙空虛，所以我希望本班畢業同學，不要存過大奢望，訓練班訓練期間，只有六個月，在這短短的時間，所得智識，自然不多，即自身已有很充足的理論，但爲配合實際工作起見，要入報館工作，還必須從很低地位做起。不要以爲我們是新聞協會訓練出來的，我們有此靠山，此稱觀念是錯誤的。總之，我希望諸君日後憑自已的眞才實學，去建立新聞界的地位，去替中國新聞事業開拓廣大的前進，以報答新聞協會栽培靑年記者的一番苦心。</p>
<p>學生代表答詞</p>
<p>最後學生代表陸愼廷致答詞云：「我們都知道報紙是人民的喉舌，是普及敎育的工具，是政府機關的傳聲筒，他非但可以推動社會進步，並且可以帮助一切事業的發展。在現代的世界上，我們要求國家的富强與人民生活的改善，就非得靠托這種新聞事業不可，所以我們都有着濃厚的興趣，到靑年記者訓練班來受訓練。</p>
<p>受訓期間，承蒙諸位光生循循善誘，使我們得到不少知識，後來被派到各報館去實習，又蒙各處編輯先生熱心指導，使我們得到更多學問。今天舉行畢業典禮，又承新聞界的前輩先生出席，我們覺得無上光榮。此地我特地代表全體同學向諸位先生道謝，此後我們仍舊需要諸位先生繼續指導與鞭督，我們自已也應該繼續苦修。</p>

<h3>重典以外　安定物價方案之一</h3>
<p>— 松靑</p>
<p>在美國內戰時代，有一次林肯對行政長官寂丁說：「在這種危急關頭，華爾街交易所那羣喪心病狂的傢伙們，還在以金子的上落做賭注，你做何感想？在我，我主張把他們的頭一個一個斬下來。」結果出人意料之外，金價跳漲四分之一强。「治亂世用重典」，原則上祇有贊感，但是與其說它是治亂世之「道」，勿寗說它是治亂世之「術」。這與術是有分別的。禹王治水，他修堤開道的技巧是治水之術，然而他引流入海的主張才是治水之道。道與術又互爲表裏。有道而無術，先賢王安石先生不能免於九仞之山功簣一籌；有術而無道，林肯治金價的失敗是另一個例十</p>
<p>洽亂世之不易，首要是爲了民生艱苦，物價飛漲，柔弱的不免困頓待斃，强悍的就挺而走險。社會道德墮落，法紀蕩然，糜不種因於此；而風氣一開，不論是否　逼於此，做官的必巧取豪奪，爲商的必囤貨居奇，已成了一種道德的新水準。物價高漲逼人爲惡，而作惡又復鼓動物價，如此循環不已，互爲因果，做成今日民無瞧類的局面。所以治亂世之道，首重管理物價安定民生。做官的必須能生活於飢餓水準之上，然後才能用重典使之淸廉公正；爲商的必須能經營於物價平穩情况下，無遭受資產貶値之處，然後才能用重典使之不囤貨居奇。天下少見過枵腹從公的官吏，也少見過毀家市義的商人，這是不便苛求，也不能苛求的。基於以上的論斷，我們得出一個結論來，就是安定物價還須求之於單純的制裁囤貨作奸之外。</p>
<p>物價高漲的原因，除去囤貨作奸等助虐的人爲因素之外，最主要的是因爲戰時物資缺乏，供不及需。物資缺乏，不論是爲了來源斷絕無法補充，是爲了運輸困難接濟不暢，是爲了生產停頓供給短絀，在今日特殊情勢之下，想積極的從正面去解決，可以肯定的說無往而不碰壁。由過去幾年的目諸事實來看，增產運動整理運輸都是渺不可期的。當今解決物價惟一可循的途徑，祇有捨本逐末的從分配上着眼——滅少消費量。各前進國家無不循此途徑，祇要一看德日民衆食糧配給量之少即可了然。爲一般有心人所景慕的德日統制經濟體制，究其極沒有什麽了不得，祇是做到度量供給的可能來分配消費而已。欲求安定我國物價亦捨此莫爲；否則，在物資缺乏塲合下，人人取用足够之消費量，勢必供不及需，由於價格條律的遝行祇有使物價抬高以完成兩個使命：（一）高抬物價。强使經濟能力薄弱的人減低甚至停止消費，以湊合供給量。（二）高抬物價以誘致物資的流通。後者則反招致囤積的盛行，減少供給量。前者做成朱門酒肉臭路有餓死骨的畸形狀態，何若在合理的分配之下，來共同減少消費以達到不患寡而患不均的至理。下列的方案係以都市爲立塲。</p>
<p>分配消費方案</p>
<p>（甲）物資管理欲求分配消費能合理的施行，必須嚴格管理物資以免流弊。</p>
<p>Ａ農產品（一）所有流入本市的農產品槪由政府加以收買，人民不得私行收買。</p>
<p>（二）收買價格以本市目前之黑市價格爲準，包括產地價格，單幫運輸成本及利潤。價格一經訂定即不得變更，除非運輸成太有變更。</p>
<p>Ｂ工業品（一）各商店綫房製造廠所現存及製造之工業品槪由政府等級統制，人民祇能整批轉售易主，，不得私行售與消費者</p>
<p>（二）工業品價格由政府評訂</p>
<p>Ｃ原料（一）流入者由政府收買同農業品。規存及製造者由政府登記統制同工業品。人民不得私行</p>
<p>（二）原料價格田政府評訂，流入者同農產品。</p>
<p>（乙）農業品與工業品的交流農產品的再生產成本多半基于工業品之消費開支，是以農產品與工業品合理化的互惠交流，爲安定農產品物價及圓滑收買之主要關鍵。</p>
<p>Ａ凡遝輸農產品或原料至上海販賣者，概得配以所值之工業品。</p>
<p>Ｂ配給價格以訂定收買農產品價格時之黑市價格爲準，一經訂定即不得更動。</p>
<p>（丙）消費配　度量各項物資可能的供給量以分配市民之消費量，故必須採配給制强制施行。譬如根據各項統計上海食米每年可能之流入損，平均每人每日祗能消費米五勺，即以此平均量配給各市民。布匹衣襪等工業品亦莫不同此。</p>
<p>Ａ農產品（一）市民得憑配給證干規定日期內，向各零售配給商店購買指定數量之米榮雜糧等物品</p>
<p>（二）配給價格包括收買價格及利潤。</p>
<p>Ｂ工業品（一）市民得憑配給證于規定日期內，向各普通商店購賈指定數量之物品，品級選擇聰便，價格根據政府之評價。（每日必需品如火柴之屬則由指定之配給商店經售）</p>
<p>（二）商店得憑市民交來之配給證申請進貨。</p>
<p>Ｃ原料（一）原料由政府配給各製造商。</p>
<p>（二）製造商應同時以相當量之製造成品棧單開交政府。</p>
<p>方案的補充</p>
<p>（甲）食料燃料分配問題減少米柴的消費是否可能而不違反生存條件，是值得詳加考慮的。「不患寡而患不均」固是至理名言，但是寡到不足以維持生存也就沒有意義了。關於這一問題可以從兩方面來取得答案。第一方面就是市民的食量可不可照目前的數量加以減少，事實上中國人吃得多是不可否認的，就筆者過去在東北所目睹的情形觀之，中國人一個人的飯量可抵日本人兩個人或甚至一家人——夫妻子三人——的飯量，而他們的菜食並不見豐富，不過酸梅子兩枚，生魚一兩片，蛤蜊湯一小盅而已，至於食油更可說少到無有。承平時期尙且如人怕還要減少點消費吧。爲甚麼我們不能？何况從科學的見地上看，吸收過量的炭水化合物並無補於健康。是以減低消費最是不生問題的，所惟一感到痛苦的就是塡慣了的肚皮不塡飽有點習慣上的不自在，經過相當日期的糾正，此種感覺就會消失的。說到燃料的減少消費量，實在是個使用技術的合理化與否的問題，一家人每日用柴三十斤，如十家合燒衹百五十斤即足。也是不成爲問題的問題。</p>
<p>第二方面按照一般情勢觀察，上海食糧燃料的可能供給量並不較正常的消費量短絀到極大的數量，但是由於囤積爭購儲藏及不經濟的消費增加了其差度。如能注意到下述幾個問題，必能使減低消費量的程度不碍及生存條件。（一）米麥雜糧甚至塊根菜蔬及米製品如年糕米粉之屬，一律以及主要食品形式配給市民，不能出以補助性質，因爲江海人輕視雜糧，所以在使用上也較爲浪費，是不應該的事。（二）市上一切細巧點心一律禁點也祇能以米糧配給證來掉換，不得私行出售，作坊之原料申請亦即以此項交來之配給證爲據。（三）飯館出售飯食亦以米糧配給證掉換，不得私行出售。</p>
<p>（乙）工業品分配問體日用工業品除去日常必需用物如火柴之屬，其餘衣襪等物都可以盡量減少消費。減少消費的意義，一面固爲了節省原料，一面也爲了留來盡量供給農村交換農產品。分配消費的數量即以此爲準。工業品種類繁多，許多非日常必須之奢侈品是否亦採配給制，比如絲襪呢絨化妝品等，表面上觀之似乎不必採配給制，可是因爲凡是購買奢侈品的都是富裕之家，富裕之家的食量必較小，而食糧的存儲亦必較高，以其所有易其所無是再公平不過的事，所以主張採申請配給制，以米糧配給證來交換。半必需品則不妨採收回舊用具的申請配給制。</p>
<p>（丙）農產品與工業品交流問題（一）收買農產品以提供工業品爲基礎，不但是合理的必需的而且是個事實，目前任何單帮販客運輸物品至上海，必易購工業品返鄉，此一原則絕不容懷疑。關於二者交換的價格比率，我們堅持採一特定時期的黑市傻格爲準，而不採用單純的生產成本評議，原因是爲了第一不出新立異以刺激市面，第二這種黑市價格的交換比率包括了雙方供需的成份在內。此價格的交換比率旣包括雙方供需的成份在內，則除非供需發生變化，應可能永恆的維持不變。此工業品價格顯較政府評議之生產成本價格爲高，此多出的利潤可留做　將來交換比率變更時的津貼基金。（二）根據上述的交流作用很易發一種錯覺，以爲旣以互惠交流爲原則。則農產品的流入可絕無問題，或者以爲操從工業品價格即可以誘致食糧的流入。此錯覺由於對下列因素的忽略而起：Ａ可能的農產品供給量。（除去軍米及農村生產者的消費（Ｂ可能的工業品供給量。Ｃ可能的都市最低生存消費量。Ｄ可能的農村消費自願縮減量。</p>
<p>（丁）原料分配問題　物資短絀時期，原料分配雖與消費分配性質不同，亦有其經濟使用之途。（一）生產效能低於標準的製造廠停配。（二）非必須品製造蒼停配。（三）製成品務趨簡易化節約化，如襪必短統，汗衫無袖……。</p>
<p>上述方案完全基於現狀，所謂農產品收買不過由零星收買變爲集體收買，所謂工業品統制也就是物品登記的擴大，所謂分配消費也不過是目前配給制的推廣，所謂減低消費量也不過是减低富人的浪費來注挹貧民的窮困，所謂農工業品交流正是鐵一般的事實，加以交換比率的訂定不過是制止人爲的操縱而已。不抵觸事實，而祗是合理的修正與推廣，所以其實施的可能性很大。但是它的缺點也不能不承認，最重要的是分配消費祇執住都市一端，對農村生產者旣不能加以消費限制，也不能加以工業品的直接配給，農工產品交流因而發生摩擦，影響整個效果是不可避免的。怎樣才能達到完全，祇有期待政治力量的深入了。</p>
<p>目前本市經濟前途表面雖呈平寗，其實正在蘊育着危機，米價已超過十關，處於水深火熱中的小民豈堪再遭打擊，民生問題的澈底解決已不容再事遲疑，管窺之見尚望明達之士指敎。</p>

It is reported that implementation will begin on March 1st. The Military Commission authorities attach great importance to the general promotion of political training work and have ordered all military units to establish political training offices. It is learned that the Central Army Officer Training Corps will also be formally established tomorrow (March 1st). It is rumored that Wu Yu, the section chief of the corps, will assume the position of director of the political training office.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Achieves Comprehensive Results in Luzon in One and a Half Months: Over 70,000 Enemy Soldiers Killed or Wounded</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) - Since the enemy forces landed in Lingayen Gulf on January 9th, the Japanese ground forces on Luzon Island, under the command of General Yamashita, have fought bravely, causing increasing damage to the enemy landing forces. From the date of the enemy American landing until February 23rd, in this one and a half months, the comprehensive results achieved by the Japanese army, in terms of enemy casualties alone, have reached over 70,000. The battle results are recorded as follows: over 70,000 soldiers killed or wounded, 470 artillery pieces destroyed, 18 artillery pieces captured, 235 tanks destroyed or set on fire, 545 various vehicles burned, over 90 aircraft shot down or destroyed, 60 ships sunk or destroyed, 29 other boats destroyed, over 100 shelters destroyed and burned, over 250 heavy machine guns destroyed, and over 130 heavy machine guns captured. These results do not include those achieved at Corregidor Island and by the Japanese air force, and the results in the Banban area are those before February 14th.</p>
<p>Philippine Base, 27th (Central News Agency) - The enemy forces on Corregidor in Manila Bay are currently launching fierce attacks with a large amount of material. On the 24th, Japanese and American forces continued to engage in fierce fighting in the central highlands of the island.</p>
<p>Japanese Army in Manila Resist from Buildings</p>
<p>Lisbon, 27th (Central News Agency) - According to news from the Manila front, the New York News Manila correspondent reported on the morning of the 26th as follows: Another group of Japanese soldiers, other than those in the old city, have fortified the three major buildings south of the Pasig River—the Legislative Building, the Finance Bureau, and the Bureau of Agriculture and Commerce—into solid fortresses and continue to fight to the death. The roofs and upper parts of these buildings were burned down two weeks ago, and the Japanese army has cleverly built trenches in the basements. Inside these basements, bunkers made of iron sheets and cement are equipped with electric minefields and machine-gun nests. The correspondent also reported on the pincer attack by the Japanese army east of Manila, stating that American forces encountered fierce resistance from the Japanese army in the highlands northeast of Antipolo, ten miles east of Manila. The Japanese forces in that area, holding strong trenches, bombarded the American vanguard with heavy artillery, mortars, and machine guns, hindering the American advance.</p>
<h3>50 Enemy Tanks Heavily Damaged in Burma</h3>
<p>Burma Front Base, 26th (Central News Agency) - On the 24th, the Japanese air force, in cooperation, destroyed the enemy's water operations on the banks of the Irrawaddy River during the day. Fighter planes suddenly entered a certain tribe and ambushed the enemy's truck units, setting two on fire and heavily damaging 48. At midnight that day, the Japanese air force launched a large-scale attack on the crossing point at Kyeniang, setting four places on fire (including one major fire), inflicting a great blow on the enemy. The Japanese army suffered no damage.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Cai Pei Visits Prime Minister Koiso</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) - Cai Pei, the Chinese ambassador to Japan, visited Prime Minister Koiso at his official residence at 4:00 p.m. on the 26th. After various important discussions, he departed.</p>
<h3>East Asian Nations Should Awaken, Rise Up and Bear the Heavy Responsibility of Defense: Enemy American Attempt to Counterattack the Mainland Will be Difficult to Succeed</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report - The enemy forces that landed on Iwo Jima have suffered nearly 20,000 casualties. Commander Tanaka, the overall commander of the landing operation, has also explained the situation. However, the Japanese side does not believe that the enemy's offensive has weakened as a result. We also do not believe that the enemy's modern warfare is fierce. However, the US's poverty in manpower and material has already affected its boasted operation of landing on the Chinese mainland. This is very obvious. When the Chongqing spokesperson met with reporters on the 7th, he denied the rumor that the US military was using black soldiers in the transport units sailing from India to China. From this fact, it can be proven that it is impossible for the US military to transport a large number of troops to the Chinese mainland to carry out a long-term war against Japan. Therefore, there is a plan to use black soldiers. They attempt to seize command with their own cadres and drive the Chongqing army and black soldiers to sacrifice for them in the war against Japan. For the United States, using Chinese land and manpower to fight against Japan is a consistent ambition since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. Now that Chongqing is shouting for a general counteroffensive on the mainland, this is also the American counteroffensive against Japan. The purpose is of course to make Chongqing succumb to its control. Chongqing's war of resistance has lasted for eight years. After the Japanese army carried out a major longitudinal operation on the mainland last spring, Chongqing's combat power suffered a major blow. Even Chongqing itself admits this. Now Chongqing has repeatedly attempted to reorganize the mixed army, but today, the local army still dominates. Judging from its combat power, it is possible to wage war against Japan with only about half of its total strength. Therefore, it is difficult for the counteroffensive against Japan to succeed. According to the investigation, during last year's mainland operation, the enemy fought with approximately 100 divisions, of which 15 divisions were reduced, 45 divisions lost less than half of their strength, and 23 divisions needed to be reorganized. The loss in manpower was approximately 700,000, equivalent to the strength of 50 divisions. The loss in material resources, such as weapons and ammunition, was approximately 30,000 tons. Moreover, important resource production areas such as Guilin, Liuzhou, and Hunan, the gunpowder manufacturing areas of Qingdong, and the agricultural and mineral resource areas were completely lost. It is estimated that the average annual loss of the Chongqing army, excluding war injuries and desertions, was approximately 230,000 in the 30th year of the Republic of China, 210,000 in the 31st year, 240,000 in the 32nd year, and 700,000 in the 33rd year. How to compensate for this loss is considered the most troublesome thing for Chongqing. However, in order to replenish the lost troops each year, it is necessary to reduce strategic units. Therefore, it is attempted to Americanize the army and change its equipment to compensate for the shortage of soldiers. The organization target is approximately 200 to 300 divisions. Once the reorganization is completed, the counteroffensive against Japan will begin immediately. Chongqing's mobilization of 200,000 educated young people to join the army is also for this purpose. In addition, it is planned to improve the treatment of soldiers and replenish ammunition. However, whether the American landing on the Chinese mainland is a blessing for China, the American war aim is to "obtain overseas markets for its own industry." It puts the world into chaos. This is an invasion with a double personality of both waging war and talking about peace. The United States' recent subtle policy toward China has always been to hold Chongqing and attempt to fully utilize China's total strength to counterattack Japan. Their purpose is to make the Chinese sacrifice for them. As the American side said, Chongqing has no happiness to speak of. All that exists is malignant currency inflation and the poverty of the people. The day when Chongqing starts the general counteroffensive against Japan is the time when China will cause great chaos and the day when the war of resistance against Japan will collapse. Since the start of the war, it has been several years. All East Asian nations should immediately awaken, not be tempted by the Anglo-Saxon conspiracy, and rise up to shoulder the heavy responsibility of defending East Asia.</p>
<h3>Japanese House of Representatives Decides to Reconvene in March: Agreement Reached at Yesterday's Consultation Meeting</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) - Since the Japanese House of Representatives naturally adjourned on February 8th, there has been a high demand for the reconvening of the Diet given the urgency of the situation. Therefore, a Diet consultation meeting was held on the morning of the 27th in the Speaker's reception room to review the issue of reconvening the Diet. As a result, everyone unanimously agreed that the Diet should be reconvened to urgently implement various decisive war policies and demand that the government report on the war situation obtained through the implementation of strong politics. At the same time, they will re-question the government's confidence and other matters. As for the timing and method of reconvening the Diet, it was decided to do so again after a meeting, and a telegram will be sent to the soldiers on Iwo Jima to express gratitude and encouragement. The timing of the reopening will have to take into consideration the situation of the government and the attitude of the Yokusan Seijikai, and the period is approximately in early March.</p>
<h3>Japanese Postal Savings Increase Dramatically</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) - The national savings amount for the 20th year of the Showa era in Japan was 41 billion yen, of which a portion was postal savings, which had been increasing dramatically every month. In particular, after the fixed-amount savings enhancement campaign was launched from September to October of last year, it increased to 1.17 billion yen. Furthermore, after the decisive battle savings emphasis campaign was implemented in December, it increased to 1.55 billion yen in January. At this point, the monthly target amount for postal savings increase in the 19th year of the Showa era was 1.8 billion yen, which has been completed in ten months. Since the beginning of that year until mid-February, the cumulative net increase has reached a huge amount of 10 billion yen. Compared with the increase of 5 billion yen during the same period in the previous year, it has actually exceeded twice the amount. The current postal savings amount is 29 billion yen, so it will soon break through 30 billion yen.</p>

<h3>Chongqing People's Shipping Company's Poor Business</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 27th (Central News Agency) - The economy under Chongqing's rule is experiencing ever deepening troubles due to soaring prices without end. Recently, the People's Shipping Company, which is jointly operated by the Chongqing government and private individuals, has suffered losses of over 200 million yuan in its business operations in the past year due to the impact of rising prices. It is rumored that if the Chongqing government does not find a way to remedy the situation, its future business will face even greater difficulties. According to the company's business report for the 33rd year of the Republic of China, the price of fuel has risen 550 times higher than before the incident, the steel plates necessary for ship repairs have risen 2,182 times, and rice has risen 538 times. The soaring prices are extremely alarming. Therefore, the balance of income and expenditure has been lost, and the Chongqing authorities have also said that they are helpless.</p>

<h3>Crimean Conference Plans to Divide German Territory</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 27th (Central News Agency) - Reuter reports that the London Observer stated: The Crimean Conference decided to divide German territory and establish a country on the west bank of the Rhine River, which would be called independent but would actually be controlled by the anti-Axis powers, and Upper Silesia would be ceded to Poland.</p>
<h3>Munich Suffers Air Raid: Famous Church Hit</h3>
<p>Berlin, 27th (Central News Agency) - Reuter reports: When Munich was bombed on Sunday, the spire of the city's famous Frauenkirche was hit, and St. Peter's Church and the New Town Hall were also severely damaged.</p>
<h3>Offensive and Defensive War on the Western Front Enters Second Stage: The Important City of Düren Has Been Reduced to Ruins</h3>
<p>Berlin, 27th (Central News Agency) - Reuter reports: Between the Meuse River and the Eifel region, the enemy has begun to use a large number of tanks, and General Eisenhower's offensive seems to have entered the second stage. Since the infantry and artillery failed to create a large gap in the first three days of the enemy's offensive to allow the tanks to flood in, the heavy losses of the enemy infantry forced their tank corps to come out to charge. The German forces guarding the Ruhr River line completed their mission and retreated to the second line of defense further back. American tanks are now blocked in front of this second line of defense.</p>
<p>Zurich, 27th (Central News Agency) - The German army is currently occupying the eastern part of the key city of Düren in front of the Cologne Plain and is continuing to fiercely attack the American forces that have entered the city from the north and south. However, by the 25th, the city, which had been reduced to ruins, was finally occupied by the American forces.</p>
<p>Berlin, 27th (Central News Agency) - Reuter reports: Eisenhower's offensive in the Meuse and Ruhr regions aims to advance in a pincer movement from the north and south on the left bank of the Rhine River in order to isolate the German forces north of the Düren-Cologne line. Between Düren and Linnich, the American Ninth and First Armies continue to advance towards Mönchengladbach, Düsseldorf, and Cologne, but progress is very slow. Only on both sides of Linnich have the American forces reached six to seven kilometers east of the Ruhr River. The German army has established new lines of defense on both sides of the Düren-Neuss highway to launch counterattacks. On the Düren-Cologne highway, the Soviet army is four kilometers east of Düren. In general, the Western Front war is still a fluid trench war on the fourth day. The German army is preventing the enemy from breaking through everywhere with minimal losses. The entire Ruhr line from Roermond to Düren is still under constant bombardment by German artillery fire.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting Around Saarlouis</h3>
<p>Berlin, 27th (Central News Agency) - Reuter reports: In the lower Saar River, new American tank convoys have arrived and have completed the connection of the bridgeheads on both sides of Saarlouis. German counterattacks are preventing the expansion of their bridgeheads, and German forces have made progress in several places.</p>
<h3>British and French Negotiations: Concluding an Alliance</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 27th (Central News Agency) - The German News Agency reports that the Associated Press reported: French Foreign Minister Bidault has recently discussed with British Foreign Secretary Eden and British Prime Minister Churchill for a long time. This discussion can be regarded as the beginning of formal British-French negotiations on an alliance treaty. The most serious issue is that Syria and Lebanon refuse to continue to allow France to enjoy special privileges. It is believed that the British will require France to recognize the independence of the two small countries. If France is unwilling to give up its position as a protectorate, the conclusion of the British-French alliance agreement may be delayed.</p>
<h3>French Cabinet Approves US-French Agreement</h3>
<p>Lausanne, 27th (Central News Agency) - The German News Agency reports from Paris: The Teugol Cabinet has fully approved the Franco-American agreement as suggested by the American government. Under this agreement, the United States will lend goods worth approximately 3 billion US dollars to France, including supplies of a purely military nature and imports used for reconstruction. Regarding this matter, an official statement was issued stating: Supplies shipped to North Africa and France will soon be paid for with 500 million US dollars. This payment will be paid from the approximately 2 billion US dollars of French funds frozen by the US Department of the Treasury.</p>
<h3>Riots Break Out in Romanian Capital: National Martial Law Declared</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 27th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Bucharest, on the morning of the 24th, riots broke out in Bucharest and throughout Romania. Citizens formed gangs to attack the Royal Palace, the Prime Minister's and Interior Minister's residences, police stations, and other places, launching disturbances. Therefore, the Romanian troops suppressing the riots fired on the crowds. According to a dispatch from Paris, by the 25th, only the disturbances in Bucharest had not stopped, and the situation in other cities in the country also showed a tendency to deteriorate. The Romanian government then decided to issue a national martial law order.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 27th (Central News Agency) - The German News Agency reports from London: The current situation in Romania is quite similar to the dangerous situation before the outbreak of the Greek civil war.</p>

<h3>Successful German Defensive War on the Northern and Southern Wings of the Eastern Front: Tank Battles Unfold in the Fight for Lauban</h3>
<p>Berlin, 27th (Central News Agency) - Reuter reports: Yesterday, the German army achieved two major achievements at both the northern and southern ends of the Eastern Front, namely, the defeat of the Soviet offensive plan in the southern Grodno region and the German army's defeat of the main force of three Soviet armies in East Prussia. It is quite important that the German army in Samland (East Prussia) has restored sea, road, and rail traffic to Königsberg. In the fifth battle in the Courland region (eastern Latvia), the Soviet army still failed to overcome German resistance. Marshal Sokolovsky, the Soviet general in the central sector of the Eastern Front, has not yet launched an offensive but is now engaged in advancing its northern and southern wings to align with the central sector. The German army on the northern wing has abandoned Answald, while fierce fighting has broken out again in the Fürstenberg and Lauban areas on the southern wing. Marshal Konev's vanguard advanced straight to the vicinity of Gubino and Forst before being stopped, but several Soviet bridgeheads were defeated by the German army.</p>
<p>Berlin, 27th (Central News Agency) - Reuter reports: Tank battles are currently taking place in the city of Lauban in Lower Silesia. Lauban is a key point for attacking Berlin. Yesterday, the German authorities made every effort to defend it and closed a breakthrough point. For several days, German and Soviet tanks have been engaged in mobile warfare, and several places have changed hands several times.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Interconnectedness of Politics</h3>
<p>The structure of politics is like an organic body, with all parts interconnected and interdependent. To use the human body as an analogy, it is nearly impossible for both hands to be paralyzed while both feet are strong, or for the torso to be withered while the limbs are developed. Even if such a thing were possible, it would only result in a deformed state, not benefiting the whole. Only when the five senses and all parts of the body are evenly developed and interconnected can a normal and healthy state be achieved.</p>
<p>Under the Shanghai Municipal Government, there are thirty units. (Refer to "An Outline of the Municipal Government's Structure," a continuous article in the first and second issues of this newspaper's "Shanghai Municipal Affairs" column on the 10th of this month. Although there have been recent mergers, there have also been new additions, so the number has not changed significantly.) These are like the five senses and various parts of the human body. To ensure the overall health of the municipal government, each unit must be healthy. The actions of the Secretariat can affect various bureaus, district public offices, and county governments, and the measures of the Finance Bureau can affect the work of other units. Moreover, there is mutual interaction between the units, such as between the Land Bureau and the Finance Bureau, the Police Bureau and the Economic Bureau, the Public Works Bureau (now merged with the Public Utilities Bureau and renamed the Construction Bureau) and the Health Bureau, all as interdependent as lips and teeth. The work of one unit depends on the assistance of another, and the achievements of one unit can be the foundation for the undertakings of a third. Just as the gears of a machine must mesh tightly, the fingers and arms of an animal must not be disconnected. The more numerous the units, the more difficult the coordination; the larger the organization, the more difficult the command. This is the reason. Now that the municipal authorities have paid attention to simplifying the structure, they should conduct a systematic review of the overall organization and determine a fair and necessary plan for abolitions, mergers, or new establishments. Furthermore, they should promote the joint office system to the extent possible. This would not only save on redundant organizations for general affairs, documentation, personnel, and statistics, as well as the tediousness of official correspondence, visits, and phone calls, but also concentrate the spirit, increase efficiency, facilitate dispatch, and facilitate observation. Each unit could learn from mutual comparison and competition, thus seeking its own path to health, and avoid the drawbacks of "the emperor is far away" of independent administrations neglecting each other.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government's relationship to the central government is like the limbs to the head. While the limbs and face should strive for their own health and development, they cannot solve their own problems in isolation from the head. If the foot hurts, the hand will soothe it; if the left hand itches, the right hand will scratch it; if attacked from behind, one must turn around and strike with a fist. These are all actions of the head that benefit the safety of the limbs. Now, when speaking of governing, transforming, and building Shanghai, the Shanghai Municipal Government is at the forefront and bears the primary responsibility. However, with a myriad of tasks and complex details, some of which should be managed by the local government and can be solved by the local government, such as internal rectification, municipal and rural security, and fiscal management, all within the authority of the municipal government. If one is truly determined, one will surely have the strength, and success is only a matter of time. As for the distribution of resources, the streamlining of transportation, and the increase or decrease of power, these are all beyond the authority of the municipal government. It seems that even with determination, one can hardly have the strength, and success is even less certain. For matters where determination surely leads to strength, one should exert one's utmost effort. For matters where determination hardly leads to strength, one should report to and seek instructions from the central government, so as to obtain effective solutions. The central government should have an overall plan, the authority to negotiate internally and externally, and the determination and ability to solve problems that a province or city cannot solve on its own. Otherwise, there is no point in talking about governing Shanghai, transforming Shanghai, or building Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Intense Battles in Central Iwo Jima: Japanese Forces Repulse Enemy Offensives; Geothermal Area Becomes a Huge Battlefield</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) – Since the enemy troops landing on Iwo Jima suffered fierce counterattacks from Japanese forces in front of the Japanese lines on the 23rd, their progress has been completely halted. To break this stalemate, from the evening of the 25th, enemy naval forces launched fierce naval bombardment of the main Japanese positions throughout the night. On the morning of the 26th, under the cover of naval bombardment and bombing, the enemy landing forces launched a major offensive on the entire front with a large number of heavy and light artillery, seeking to break the stalemate of the past few days in one fell swoop. In addition, the main force of the Japanese troops on Mount Suribachi broke through the new positions on the night of the 23rd and finally joined the main positions on the night of the 24th. The enemy's encirclement of the 3rd Marine Division on Mount Suribachi detoured around the Japanese positions. Currently, the enemy is launching a major offensive on the main Japanese positions with the 5th Division on the western front, the 4th Division on the front, and the 3rd Division. Therefore, the enemy's focus of attack remains the geothermal area in the central part and the Motoyama airfield. On the night of the 24th, the Japanese forces merged the Suribachi garrison with the main positions and launched a full-scale counteroffensive. As a result, Iwo Jima is now centered on the geothermal area, the intersection of the Motoyama airfield runway, and the area from the west to near the city gate and the south to the south side of Byōbū-yama [Screen Mountain], which has become a huge battlefield.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) – The enemy Americans are extremely impatient to break through Iwo Jima and are abnormally anxious. The enemy seems to want to destroy the island in one fell swoop. The contents of documents captured by the Japanese forces after the enemy landed reveal that the enemy's plan was to break through the Japanese defenses in four days and control the entire island. However, the actual combat after the landing was contrary to the enemy's expectations. The enemy's bloodshed increased daily, and therefore, the enemy forces, unable to advance, dispatched carrier-based aircraft and B-29s on the 25th to jointly bomb the Japanese mainland, while simultaneously launching a general offensive on Iwo Jima. The enemy's actions were quite vigorous. On the line of confrontation between the two armies, the enemy in the area between Mount Asō and the geothermal area temporarily gathered about 80 tanks. In addition, they gradually massed troops and dispatched more than 50 air vehicles to cooperate. At that time, the naval bombardment from ships cruising in the nearby sea also became more intense. In response to this aggressive general offensive, the Japanese garrison forces immediately concentrated artillery fire, and the enemy's initial offensive was completely repulsed. By the evening of the 25th, there was almost no change in the line of confrontation between the two armies. The Japanese forces are still firmly defending the area around the southern end of the central airfield on Byōbū-dai [Screen Plateau] and the geothermal area.</p>
<p>Central Pacific Base, 26th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese garrison on Iwo Jima continues to fight bloodily day and night, repeatedly causing the enemy to bleed. The battle situation on the 24th became even more intense. Although the enemy's offensive was active, the battle situation still had no major changes. The powerful enemy forces attempting to occupy the second airfield invaded from the west around 1:50 PM with 64 tanks as the vanguard. A part of them broke into a corner of the Japanese army's position in the Motoyama area, and other units also advanced toward Byōbū-yama. The Japanese garrison forces are bravely intercepting and launching a counterattack at dusk. Short-range combat ensued. At 8:20 PM, the Japanese naval air force, responding to the brave battles of the Japanese ground garrison, repeatedly and fiercely bombed the enemy positions, and flames could be seen everywhere in the distance.</p>
<p>American Planes Re-Attack Macau</p>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) – After the enemy American air force blindly bombed Portuguese Macau on January 16, several P-24 planes suddenly re-attacked Macau around 10:55 AM on the 25th, repeatedly strafing the bustling streets and the area near the docks. They also strafed transport ships registered under the Panamanian flag, and ten Portuguese crew members were seriously injured.</p>
<h3>The Anguish of the British Empire</h3>
<p>"Better do something foolish that has been done before than something wise that has never been done." Balfour's maxim is the golden rule of British domestic and foreign policy.</p>
<p>Since the start of the war, the greatest goal of British diplomacy has been to conserve its own strength and use other countries to continue the war. From this, it can be inferred that the biggest problem of British domestic policy is how to make the people and the masses of the colonies fight for a certain goal. The British war aim seems to be to defeat Germany; in fact, at the time of the Dunkirk disaster, when the possibility of a German attack on the British mainland was very high, this was reason enough. But after that, the situation improved somewhat for Britain. Why was it still necessary to defeat Germany? What could the British people and colonies gain from this? This is of course a question that needs to be explained.</p>
<p>Why Fight?</p>
<p>This needs to be explained from the question of who holds the leadership in the British war machine. Although the British political world appears to have reconciled due to the political truce (see "The Bankruptcy White Paper of the British Empire" in this newspaper's weekly on February 25), the cadres of each party do not intend to cooperate, and the lower-level forces have no intention of completely cooperating. The labor class, which expanded its power during the war, demands to speak whenever it has the opportunity, hoping to replace the conservative forces and seize power if possible. Therefore, suppressing them has become an important task for Churchill and others. If this is not successful, why they are fighting becomes incomprehensible.</p>
<p>Recently, the British political world, due to the optimistic tone of the approaching end of the European war, has already begun to discuss the timing of the next general election and the attitude that each party should take at that time. In general, when the political truce between the parties is eliminated and the expansion of the Labour Party's power cannot be stopped, what kind of strategy should the Conservative Party, centered on Churchill, use to deal with it? This seems to be the central issue.</p>
<p>The British Dream</p>
<p>Therefore, in order to boost the morale of its own people and make them endure the burden of the war, the British government has had to depict the old rose-tinted dreams, arguing that the world must be built by war. Some time after the Dunkirk disaster, the British "Economist" magazine said in the summer of 1940: "The time has indeed come for the organization of oil-exporting countries to guarantee each citizen a sufficient supply of food, clothing, shelter, and other generally recognized necessities of life." As the magazine itself admitted, this argument only represented "not very new general ideas that were popular at the time." The British people, who were greatly disappointed after the last World War, probably hoped fervently from the beginning of this war that they would not suffer such painful experiences again.</p>
<p>Oxford University Professor Lord William Beveridge, commissioned by the British government, began to draft a social insurance plan. As a result of the research, the so-called Beveridge Social Insurance Plan was published in December 1942. The purpose of the plan was to prevent "poverty" within the country without using "Bolshevik methods," and to "guarantee a minimum monetary income when all citizens encounter various crises in life and occupation."</p>
<p>Domestic Disputes</p>
<p>The Beveridge Plan was submitted to the House of Commons for review in February 1943. The radical faction of the Labour Party enthusiastically advocated the immediate implementation of the plan and the creation of a social insurance department, but the government strongly insisted on the need for further research, and the proposal for immediate implementation was rejected. Because of this issue, a rift occurred within the Labour Party, and the radicals even demanded the resignation of the cabinet members belonging to the party, which was a moment of great anxiety. After the desperate efforts of the party cadres, it was finally eased.</p>
<p>After that, although the British government did not formally touch on the domestic front problem excessively, it still seemed to be preparing to create a replacement plan following the line of the Beveridge Plan. Then, on September 26, 1944, the government's social security plan was published in a white paper. The British government's policy on domestic management after the war was thus generally revealed.</p>
<p>What exactly is the British government's social security plan, which is made up of the "essence" of the Beveridge Plan? In short, it is a plan to guarantee the minimum livelihood of all people in times of unemployment, old age, illness, and injury through extremely broad social insurance. The plan has detailed provisions for family allowances, sickness and unemployment relief, apprenticeship allowances, sickness relief for the self-employed, family dependency allowances, retirement benefits, maternity benefits, widows' allowances, general allowances, orphan relief, widows' benefits, and milk subsidies. However, from a fundamental point of view, it is not much different from the pre-war unemployment insurance system. It is just that the working class pays a fixed amount of insurance premiums in peacetime, plus subsidies from the family and the government, in order to achieve "social stability."</p>
<p>Empty Promises</p>
<p>The above is the "new post-war world" that the British government is drawing in front of the people. This is not at all new and is obviously based on the British tradition of "charity." However, even if it is not new, as long as "social stability" can be achieved as desired, then the goal can be considered achieved. This government plan has become the object of discussion in all aspects of the British political and economic circles. Various facts have been clarified from this, and the most noteworthy is that the Labour Prime Minister Bevin once announced in the House of Commons that the number of unemployed after the war would not exceed 8% of the total British labor force. From this point of view, this imperfect plan seems to be based on the assumption that the number of unemployed is below 8%. If it exceeds this percentage, the planned reference amount of £831 million will inevitably be insufficient. As a result, there is no solution other than increasing insurance premiums or reducing or even suspending payments. In fact, in the British House of Lords, the argument that the burden arising from the implementation of the government plan will be beyond the capacity of the British people seems to be very powerful. On the other hand, the Labour Party is still very dissatisfied with the unemployment allowance of 24 shillings per week stipulated in the original plan, and angrily shouts "Let the returning soldiers be disillusioned." If the payments are further reduced or suspended, then the beautiful dream of this "golden land" will be destroyed at once. Furthermore, there seems to be deep dissatisfaction with the government's plan to revise the Beveridge Plan, limiting the sickness and unemployment insurance benefits to within three years and thirty weeks, respectively, and stipulating that the implementation of social insurance must wait until "after the end of the current war."</p>
<p>Bleak Future</p>
<p>In contrast to the government's white paper, Beveridge has newly published the "Full Employment Plan," arguing that revitalizing exports is an indispensable prerequisite for full employment. This is a truly succinct argument. In short, whether it is the Beveridge Plan or the government plan, it will not be established if it does not foresee the restoration of a certain degree of economic prosperity to the UK. This is also a conclusion that can be drawn from the experience of pre-war unemployment insurance. However, to what extent can the economic recovery of the UK after the war be hoped for?</p>
<p>The foundation of the economic prosperity, no, the economic survival of the British Empire lies in three items: trade, shipping, and overseas investment. All three items have been declining in this war. The UK has lost its position as the "world's factory," which has been the case for a long time. Since the start of this war, there has been no place in the world's UK goods market, whether it is India, Australia, China, or South America, where American goods have not been promoted. Especially since the US has obtained a guarantee from the UK that the UK will no longer export Lend-Lease materials or similar materials, the UK's export trade has obviously been further hindered. According to the newly established US-UK Lend-Lease Agreement, this treaty has been repealed, but Lend-Lease materials have also been halved at the same time. The white paper issued by the British government on November 20, 1944, shows the fact that the UK's export trade decreased to less than half between 1938 and 1943, and the total export value in 1943 accounted for only 2.8% of the national net income, which was significantly lower than 10.2% in 1938.</p>
<p>Overseas Trade</p>
<p>Can the UK recover these markets after the war? Today, there are very few goods that the UK can produce that have real value in the international market. The textile factories of Lancashire and the once-unparalleled Manchester steel industry are now inferior to those of the US, Germany, and the Soviet Union. Only silver products, wool fabrics, diamonds, radio, agricultural processed products, horses, and linen can compete with other countries. It is a fact that the industry of the British Empire's autonomous territories and colonies has rapidly progressed during the war, but this makes the UK's position even more disadvantageous. The UK, which owes the US a huge amount of money in the form of Lend-Lease weapons and whose markets have become increasingly narrow due to the sale of American goods during the war, will inevitably fall into extreme hardship after the war, no matter in what form the war ends. As Smuts said, the UK after the war will be "economically very poor."</p>
<p>Before the war, the income that the UK obtained from the shipping industry and overseas investment was listed under the item of income outside of trade, which was more than enough to make up for the excess of imports. Although its domestic trade was sluggish, the British merchant fleet, as a transporter of goods, raised the British flag, and there was almost no major port in the world without its traces. However, due to the huge wartime consumption and the rapid development of the American shipbuilding industry, if the UK has 10 million tons after the war, then the US probably has about three times this amount of merchant ships. As for commercial aviation, it can be said that it is the same; the US is already using bases owned by the UK today, slowly nibbling away at the UK's commercial air routes.</p>
<p>Wasted Inheritance</p>
<p>Although trade and shipping are so depressed, if there is still overseas investment that was boasted to be the world's number one before the war, then the UK may still have the possibility of rebuilding its external economy. The accumulated overseas investment over many years is the legacy of the past prosperous era of the British Empire. It is precisely because of this that the UK was able to safely overcome many previous crises. However, the overseas investment, which is as important as life to the UK, has been consumed more severely than anything else in this war.</p>
<p>Of the British overseas investment, which was said to be about £5 billion before the war and the interest alone reached £100 million per year, it is estimated that about £1 billion has been destroyed by the war or confiscated by Germany and Japan, and the remaining about £3.2 billion has been used up as war expenses. In addition, since the start of the war, it has also been in debt to autonomous territories and colonies for about £1.3 billion. As for the debt to the US, even after deducting the offsetting part, it is said to be about £3.5 billion. In short, the UK has almost completely wasted its pre-war overseas investment in this war. Of course, the UK has its own plans on how to reduce its debt to the autonomous territories and the US in the future, but the era when the UK reigned over the world's financial circles as a major creditor country has passed. The longer the war drags on, the more difficult it will be for the UK to extricate itself from the position of a debtor country. The British government's "Bankruptcy White Paper" published on November 28 also automatically exposed the fact that the UK had exhausted "most of the wealth accumulated since the era of [its] ancestors" in five years of war. And its export trade and shipping industry are in the aforementioned state, so it can be said that it is absolutely impossible to try to recover the overseas investment lost so far after the war.</p>
<p>The Future of Britain</p>
<p>In an essay entitled "The Future of Britain," Inge expressed the above situation as follows:</p>
<p>"The UK's position as the world's factory has long become a thing of the past. The UK's labor force is not only expensive, but its work efficiency has not improved. The UK has lent huge sums of money to various countries, resulting in the establishment of industries that can compete with British industry. Although the interest obtained from this kind of loan is slightly beneficial to balance, today, the principal lent to foreign countries has been repaid in full, and the UK has no other way to support its growing population except to export only a small amount of mineral resources and industrial products that can break through high tariff barriers today. In addition to the economic nationalism of various countries, the UK's foreign trade has also fallen into a state of hemiplegia due to the terrible increase in domestic production costs and public burdens."</p>
<p>Inge's essay was published in the British magazine "Fortnightly Review" in May 1943. He drew a conclusion from the above situation, that is, "The UK has too much population and will reach 20 million in the future." As this conservative frankly admits, the current poison of the British economy urgently seeks to reduce "labor costs," and there is no basis to expect the appearance of an era of peaceful and prosperous life like the one described in the social security plan. This point, no matter which direction the future of the war takes, is simply a decided fate for the UK. However, in order to give the British people false hope and make them continue to engage in war, it is necessary to put up a signboard that seems to improve "labor costs," such as the social security plan.</p>
<p>A Sick Man's Last Resort</p>
<p>Labour Prime Minister Bevin called the Beveridge Plan an "ambulance." According to the "Economist" magazine's commentary, "Because the ambulance is only necessary when something happens." From this point of view, it can be seen that the "Economist" also admits that "something has happened," but deliberately ignores the chronic disease that the British economy has suffered from hemiplegia. Furthermore, although this ambulance has a good appearance, its contents are not worth a look, and it may even worsen the patient's condition. Moreover, it is already highly doubtful whether it can reach the "accident" site.</p>
<p>However, the UK will certainly not sit still and wait for death, and will use all means to kill a bloody path until the very end. This will be the keynote of British domestic and foreign policy. (Translated from the 51st issue of the 25th volume of Allied World Weekly)</p>
<h3>The Tragic Situation in Hankou After Enemy American Airplanes Indiscriminately Bombed</h3>
<p>Enemy Americans, failing in their attempt to use mainland China as a battlefield, dispatched airplanes to carry out indiscriminate bombing. The unfortunate Chinese civilians suffered greatly from their poison. For example, in November and December of last year, enemy American airplanes indiscriminately bombed the urban areas of Hankou, resulting in numerous civilian casualties. This cowardly act by the enemy Americans only served to increase the hatred of the Chinese people and drive them to further cooperate with our ally, Japan, until the ultimate destruction of Britain and America is achieved.</p>

<h3>The Commodity Distribution Office Changes the Special Rice Rationing Method; Half of the Required Rice Amount is Sold Before Full Collection</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Commodity Distribution Office, in order to organize the various ration coupons that have been issued, has made slight changes to the special rice rationing method. From February 28th to March 9th, the office will distribute the main rice ration for this month. Because the required amount of rice has not yet been fully collected, half of the amount will be sold first. The quantity and price have been determined as follows:</p>
<p>Quantities of Extra Rice Rationed to Each Level</p>
<p>Based on the 11th-period extra rice purchase coupon for teachers and staff, each coupon will be allocated 1.5 dou (斗). Based on the 11th-period Grade B and the 11th-period Grade D-1 extra rice purchase coupons, each coupon will be allocated 1 dou. Based on the 11th-period Grade C extra rice purchase coupon, each coupon will be allocated 2.5 dou. Based on the 11th-period Grade D-2 extra rice purchase coupon, each coupon will be allocated 6.25 he (合). All rice is unpolished rice (糙米). The price remains at 50 yuan of national currency per shi sheng (市升). Holders of the various rice purchase coupons listed above may purchase the rice from designated publicly-owned rice sales locations within the specified period.</p>
<p>Civil Servants, Journalists</p>
<p>As for the Grade A extra rice purchase coupons for civil servants and journalists, the rationing method has been changed. All unexpired 11th and 12th-period coupons that have already been issued are invalidated. A new rationing method has been established: (1) For various bureaus and offices under the municipal government, after the number of personnel is verified by the Municipal Secretariat, the original units will apply to the Commodity Distribution Office for unified distribution according to the prescribed procedures. (2) For units outside the municipal government, if the number of personnel has been verified by the competent authority, they may directly apply to the Commodity Distribution Office for the collection and distribution of entire bags of rice. (3) For journalists and others whose numbers have been approved by the municipal government, each newspaper office will directly apply to the Commodity Distribution Office for unified distribution. The quantity and price are the same as the rice rationed to teachers and staff, calculated at 50 yuan of national currency per sheng, with half the amount to be issued first.</p>
<h3>The Paramount Dance Hall is Ordered to Suspend Operations by the Police Bureau for Violating the Ban on All-Night Operation</h3>
<p>The Municipal Police Bureau has issued a clear order prohibiting dance halls from operating all night. The Paramount Dance Hall on Jing'an Temple Road claimed to have obtained the understanding of the police authorities and violated the ban by operating all night. After receiving a report, the Municipal Police Bureau yesterday ordered the Huashan Branch to punish the dance hall with a five-day suspension of operations. Manager Yu of the dance hall falsely claimed that he had obtained permission from Japanese staff members of the police authorities to operate. A Korean national associated with the dance hall is being questioned by the bureau. Under this decisive wartime system, those who fail to recognize the current situation and their responsibilities and engage in such improper business operations will be resolutely investigated and dealt with by the police authorities.</p>
<h3>Bảo Jia Personnel Visit the Hongkou Air Raid Shelters</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Civilian Air Defense Headquarters convened representatives of the Lian Bảo chiefs from various districts and reporters from various newspapers at 10:00 AM yesterday (the 27th) to visit the air raid shelters in the Hongkou area. More than 30 people from Jing'an Temple District, Jiangning District, Changning District, Huashan District, Xinshijie District, Yimiao District, Xujiahui District, Putuo District, and Penglai District, as well as Chinese and Japanese reporters, were present. First, Police Defense Chief Hiraoka Isamu and Baojia Chief Gu Jiwu gave speeches. Then, everyone departed by car, first to the North Sichuan Road Branch Bureau, where Branch Chief Saito led a tour of the branch bureau's air raid shelter. Next, the group visited seven air raid shelters on North Sichuan Road, Liyang Road, and in the alleys, where Air Defense Section Chief Yamamoto Shinichi, Deputy Section Chief Li Zhenhuan, and clerk Kobayashi Hisaji explained the key points of building air raid shelters to the Baojia personnel and instructed them to study them in detail after this visit. Finally, the group visited the indoor air raid shelter facilities at the Wan Ho Foreign Firm on Suzhou Road, ending at 12:30 PM. Other district Baojia personnel were invited to visit in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Public Works Bureau is Closing Down</h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Works Bureau, having received the order to merge with the Public Works Bureau and be reorganized into the Construction Bureau, immediately began to expedite its closure. It ordered all its subordinate agencies to complete their closures by the 28th of this month. However, vehicle and vessel registration and other work will continue as usual during the transition period. It is reported that the closure work of the bureau has been completed. The Construction Bureau is approved to be established on March 1st. All unfinished matters of the former Public Works and Public Works Bureaus will be continued by the Construction Bureau from now on. It is reported that the newly appointed Director of the Construction Bureau, Mr. Xu Jidun, is currently planning all new facilities.</p>
<h3>The Chairman of the Russian Association Was Arrested Yesterday</h3>
<p>In order to thoroughly eradicate the atmosphere of drugs, the Municipal Police Bureau has cracked down on the major gambling den of the Russian General Association at 147 Weihaiwei Road. The den owner Wang Maoting and manager Han Huaqing have been arrested, and 174 gamblers have been caught on the spot and are being detained for investigation. It is reported that the Russian Chairman of the General Association, Ge Liebaofu (Thgceboff), and key figures Shi Weijin Shiji (Sverjensky) have also been arrested. Ge Liebaofu is the leader of the White Russians in Shanghai, and Shi Weijin Shiji is also a well-known figure among the White Russians. However, they failed to self-discipline and disregarded the law by engaging in gambling activities. The police bureau will strictly deal with them according to the law.</p>
<h3>The Gold Trade Association Warns Members Not to Manipulate Gold Prices</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Shanghai Special City Gold Trade Association has seen its affairs develop increasingly, and the number of members joining the association has been extremely enthusiastic. Those who have not yet completed the membership procedures will be regarded as illegal businesses. The municipal economic authorities have decided to ban the operations of non-members who have not joined the association. It is now reported that the association, due to the continuous increase in the market price of gold in recent days, which shows a great upward trend, cannot rule out the manipulation by a small number of speculators, which shakes the market and disrupts finance, which is purely illegal behavior and has a great impact on the entire financial system. Therefore, it is specially notified to member gold shops to be deeply warned not to participate in it, so as not to cause self-inflicted disasters. As for the legitimate protection and common welfare that should be possessed in the business of the industry, legitimate solutions should be sought, and no arbitrary actions should be taken, so as not to throw oneself into the legal net.</p>
<h3>Banks and Money Shops to Raise Interest Rates; Decision Imminent</h3>
<p>The banks and money shops in this city, in view of the rising prices and huge expenses in recent years, and in order to assist the authorities in suppressing prices and maintaining normal business operations, intend to raise lending rates. The industry has held several meetings to discuss this matter and has reached a broad consensus. A joint meeting of the banking and money shop industries will be convened this week to continue discussions and make a decision. It is reported that the lending rate will be increased by 50 percent. The industry will operate in accordance with the regulations and must not raise prices again in the middle, in order to achieve uniformity.</p>
<h3>Establishment of a Poultry Market Not Permitted</h3>
<p>Shanghai businessmen Ye Yinshan and others raised funds to establish Shanghai Poultry Market Co., Ltd., and submitted a request to the municipal government for approval for filing. The municipal government authorities believe that the organization plan of the market does not focus on procurement and transportation and is of no benefit to the source of goods. The sole purpose is to collect handling fees, which only increases the cost of goods and monopolizes the market, which has a great impact on people's livelihood. An instruction has already been issued to deny the establishment.</p>
<h3>Regular Hot District Holds Baojia Symposium</h3>
<p>Mr. Yao Yiti, the Chief Lian Bao (聯保) of the Changre Baojia District, hosted a banquet at his private residence at noon on February 25th, as the New Year began and the year changed, to entertain Director Gu of the Baojia Office and welcome the newly appointed Director Yu Dengyun of the Changshu Road Branch Bureau, as well as Deputy Director Songxia, the newly appointed chiefs and deputy chiefs of various sections, and the members of the Changshu District Branch of the Municipal District Baojia Committee. The various positive and negative Lian Baos accompanied him. During the banquet, Mr. Yao gave a welcome speech, briefly stating that the inspectors and officers who had served in the district were extremely virtuous, which was truly a blessing for the residents. Now, Director Yu of the new branch bureau has previously held important military and political positions and has followed Director Zhou and Secretary-General Luo for many years. His political achievements are well-known. In the future, the residents will naturally be able to obtain greater happiness. Subsequently, Director Gu, Deputy Director Dachuan, Director Yu, and Deputy Director Songxia gave speeches in succession. After the banquet, a symposium on Baojia household registration issues was held to discuss the future Baojia work in the Changshu district. Director Yu gave extremely detailed instructions. Chief Lian Bao Yao and others successively expressed their opinions. The fourth section of the branch bureau reported the details of the merger and reorganization of the section and the work plan, and requested the Baojia Office to issue as many application forms as possible so that the new residence permits could continue to be replaced. They discussed future events such as clearing the household registration, checking household registration forms, and training the self-defense group, etc. The situation was very harmonious, and the meeting adjourned at about 5 o'clock.</p>
<h3>The Huaxing Commercial Bank Held a Shareholders' Meeting Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Youth Reporter Training Class Holds Graduation Ceremony Yesterday; Chinese and Japanese Officials Attend and Deliver Speeches</h3>
<p>The Youth Reporter Training Class, organized by the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese News Association, solemnly held its graduation ceremony yesterday (the 27th) at 4:30 PM at the Federation of Industry and Commerce Club on the fourth floor of No. 12, the Bund. Attendees included Director Liu of the Propaganda Department, Captain Matsumoto of the Naval Fleet Press Department, Chen Binhe, Xu Liqiu, Chen Riping, Li Quanshi, Zheng Jie, Moriyama Takashi, Zhang Zhaoming, Yang Guangzheng, Liu Yunfang, Lin Junfu, Zhang Yicheng, Lu Feng, Ji Zhonghe, and over a hundred Chinese and foreign guests. The ceremony commenced promptly and concluded at 5:30 PM. The order of the ceremony is recorded as follows: (1) All stand at attention, (2) Bow in respect to the Chinese and Japanese national flags, (3) Speech by Standing Director Chen, (4) Report by Director of Academic Affairs Zhu, (5) Chairman Li presents graduation certificates, (6) Address by Chairman Chen, (7) Speeches by guests, (8) Speech by student representative, (9) Thank you speech by Director Lu, (10) Photograph taken and ceremony concludes.</p>
<p>Chen Riping’s Speech</p>
<p>Following the ceremony, Standing Director Chen Riping of the Shanghai Branch of the New News Association delivered a speech, stating, "Today is the graduation ceremony for the students of the Youth Reporter Training Class organized by the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese News Association. We are extremely grateful for the care and support of all officials and sectors of society, and especially for your presence despite your busy schedules. Details about the training class will be provided in a detailed report by the Director of Academic Affairs. We hope you will offer your invaluable guidance."</p>
<p>Report by Director of Academic Affairs</p>
<p>Next, Director of Academic Affairs Zhu reported, "The motivation for establishing the Youth Reporter Training Class began in April of last year, with the aim of re-training current news professionals. By June 1st, the training class was officially established, with a total of 50 students recommended by various newspapers. However, as many students experienced job changes or were dispatched to other locations, the number gradually decreased. Consequently, the board meeting of the former Shanghai News Joint Association decided to entrust me with the management of academic affairs. I made every effort to reorganize and recruit from the outside world. Including the original students receiving training, it has now been six months, with a total of 30 graduating students. Regarding academic affairs, we emphasized professional training, adding printing, interviewing, and legal system courses to the existing news research subjects. After four months of training and one month of internship, we have now reached the completion of graduation. I hope that all students will continue to work hard and create a new chapter for the news industry in the future."</p>
<p>Issuance of Graduation Certificates</p>
<p>Chairman Li Sihao of the New News Association (represented by Mr. Chen Riping) then presented the certificates, which were received by student representative Huang Jialu. The ceremony was simple and solemn.</p>
<p>Address by Chairman Chen</p>
<p>Chairman Chen of the Shanghai Branch of the New News Association then addressed the audience, saying, "The news industry in China is still very immature, and there is a real shortage of talent. Therefore, our association places great emphasis on the cultivation of news talent. If a newspaper has many talented journalists, then that newspaper will surely thrive. The same is true for a country. For example, before the Incident, the Ta Kung Pao placed special emphasis on talent, recruiting individuals such as Zhang Jiwan, Hu Zhengzhi, Wu Dingchang, and Wang Yunsheng, who dedicated themselves to their work. As a result, the Ta Kung Pao became a leader in the national news industry. Recently, the Sin Wan Pao has also undergone a refreshing transformation in content and layout due to the addition of new talent. As for the qualities that a news reporter should possess, I would like to offer three suggestions: (1) Must have an interest. Interest brings spirit. (2) Richness in skills and experience. (3) A correct and unwavering stance. Such a reporter will at least be welcomed and not cause people to be disgusted. Today is the graduation day for the Youth Reporter Training Class, but I have made no contribution. This is thanks to the instructors who are responsible for the training."</p>
<p>Speech by Director Liu of the Propaganda Department</p>
<p>Director Liu Dexuan of the Propaganda Department said, "I attended the founding day of the Youth Reporter Training Class organized by the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese News Association, and today I am participating in the graduation ceremony. This makes me very happy. In the past six months, the Youth Reporter Training Class has recruited outstanding young people from Shanghai and provided them with the necessary basic training in journalism. This has undoubtedly taken a great deal of effort. This shows the painstaking efforts of the directors and teachers, which is to be congratulated. Now that you have graduated, you will be assigned to various newspapers to serve. From now on, the mission and responsibilities you shoulder will be even greater. Therefore, I hope that you can work from the three perspectives of promoting culture, rectifying people's hearts, and winning glory for the country, so as not to fail the support and painstaking efforts of the directors and teachers."</p>
<p>Speech by Captain Matsumoto</p>
<p>Captain Matsumoto of the Naval Fleet Press Department said, "Today is the graduation day of the Youth Reporter Training Class. You have completed six months of training. I deeply congratulate you. The current war has entered a decisive stage, so the responsibilities you bear are extremely important. Your graduation is closely related to the development of Shanghai newspapers and the entire nation. I have high expectations for you and sincerely hope that you will work hard."</p>
<p>Speech by Li Quanshi</p>
<p>Li Quanshi said, "The training class is hosted by major newspapers. Although the Economic Daily, which I run, is a small newspaper, it has the style of a large newspaper. Therefore, I have presumptuously participated in this grand event, and I am even more surprised to be invited to speak on the stage. The ancients said, 'A single word can ruin a country,' but conversely, a single word can also revitalize a country. The news industry is like this. Every word and every phrase directly affects the public. Doing it well can revitalize a country, and doing it badly can ruin a country. Therefore, running a newspaper should be based on the interests of the public. Society, the nation, and even the entire world are all affected. Running a newspaper should be beneficial to people, and news reporters, as the actual practitioners, should pay more attention to this. As the saying goes, 'The rise and fall of a nation is the responsibility of every individual.' A reporter's pen has the power to influence the rise and fall of a country. For example, reporting on stabilizing people's livelihoods can cause rice prices to fall; conversely, it can cause rice prices to skyrocket. Although scandalous content is undesirable, it is acceptable to adopt a humorous, witty, and light-hearted tone that does not harm elegance. There is a saying that compares the pen to a knife, so showing mercy with the knife means showing mercy with the pen. I hope that all students will work hard with their pens and seek happiness for society and the nation."</p>
<p>Thank You Speech by Director Lu Feng</p>
<p>Next, Director Lu Feng gave a thank you speech, saying, "Today is the graduation ceremony of the Youth Reporter Training Class organized by the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese News Association. I am honored to have the presence of all the guests, officials, and senior figures in the news industry. I am also very grateful to Director Liu of the Propaganda Department of this city, Captain Matsumoto of the allied forces, and Mr. Li Quanshi, an authority on economics, for their respective speeches. I have been engaged in the news industry for more than ten years and have a deep passion and sorrow for the Chinese news industry. I am passionate because the Chinese news industry has made considerable progress in recent years, and I am sorrowful because, although the Chinese news industry has made progress, it is still lagging behind in the overall trend of global progress. As Mr. Binhe said, the problem is the lack of talent, that is, the lack of reporter talent. Therefore, I naturally strongly agree with Mr. Chen's initiative to open a reporter training class and discover new talent.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of reporter talent, I have two observations in the current situation of the Chinese news industry: (1) Among our Chinese news reporters, there are many who have made great contributions to the news industry and promoted its rapid development, but few are able to consistently work for newspapers. Often, after achieving some success in the news industry, they change direction midway, leave the news industry, and enter the political arena to become officials. From the perspective of the reporters themselves, it can be said that they have achieved higher success because their lives have improved, but from the perspective of the entire news industry, it is a huge loss. This phenomenon has its own historical and social reasons, but I always believe that it is a morbid condition.</p>
<p>(2) Is that those who are engaged in the news industry in our country, after reaching a certain age, often no longer seek progress themselves. This kind of situation is extremely rare in other countries. For example, in major Japanese newspapers, there are people who have been working for fifty or sixty years and are still constantly working hard to improve themselves, but it is not the case in China. Most reporters who have reached a certain age no longer plan for the news industry, but only take care of their personal lives. As a result, the progress of the Chinese news industry has become like a snail's pace. In order to remedy these two shortcomings, I believe that the only way is to cultivate new talents, and according to the law of metabolism, new growth, and the elimination of the old and decaying, so that our country's news industry will make progress day by day.</p>
<p>In the Youth Reporter Training Class, I have always advocated practicality and not emptiness, so I hope that the graduates of this class will not have too great expectations. The training period of the training class is only six months. In this short period of time, the knowledge gained is naturally not much. Even if you have sufficient theory yourself, in order to coordinate with practical work, you must start from a very low position when you enter the newspaper. Do not think that we are trained by the News Association, and we have this backer. This concept is wrong. In short, I hope that you will rely on your own true talent and learning in the future to establish a position in the news industry and to open up a broad path for the Chinese news industry, in order to repay the painstaking efforts of the News Association in cultivating young reporters.</p>
<p>Speech by Student Representative</p>
<p>Finally, student representative Lu Shenting gave a reply, saying, "We all know that newspapers are the mouthpiece of the people, the tool of popular education, and the megaphone of government agencies. Not only can they promote social progress, but they can also help the development of all undertakings. In today's world, we need to rely on this kind of news industry to achieve national prosperity and improve people's lives, so we all have a strong interest in coming to the Youth Reporter Training Class to receive training.</p>
<p>During the training period, we received a lot of knowledge from the patient guidance of all the students, and later, when we were assigned to various newspapers for internships, we also received enthusiastic guidance from the editors, so that we gained more knowledge. Today, we are holding a graduation ceremony, and we are honored to have the presence of the seniors in the news industry. Here, I would like to thank all the teachers on behalf of all the students. We will still need your continued guidance and supervision in the future, and we should continue to study hard ourselves.</p>
<p>After listening to the instructions of all the teachers just now, it seems that we have been given a compass. We will definitely keep it in mind and become a loyal, hardworking, and serving public servant in the news industry in the future. We will report the most rapid and accurate news to the people, and always stand at the forefront of society and be a pioneer in leading society." After the reply, the photography announced the completion of the ceremony and the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<h3>Points to Note When Receiving Subsidized Rice</h3>
<p>The Subsidized Rice Committee has started distributing rice yesterday. The rice collection slips for each rice-receiving household have also been distributed by representatives of public welfare and charitable organizations, news and culture circles, education circles, labor circles, business circles, and banking circles. Yesterday, the committee held its third meeting to discuss and decide on the following points to be noted by each rice-receiving household:</p>
<p>(1) The three designated warehouses for the first phase of subsidized rice started distributing rice yesterday.</p>
<p>(2) Each rice-receiving household should contact its respective unit immediately to inquire about the rice warehouse and time.</p>
<p>(3) Each rice-receiving household that borrows sackcloth bags must return them to their respective units within seven days. They must be kept intact and cannot be offset by cash. If they are not returned after the deadline, the right to receive rice in the second phase will be cancelled, and new sackcloth bags will be compensated in full.</p>
<p>(4) Each rice-receiving household is responsible for transporting the rice from the warehouse. If you need to entrust a transportation company to transport it, you can contact the Heji Transportation Company in the City Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>(5) The price of subsidized rice in the second phase is 37,000 yuan per picul. The payment date is set from February 27th to March 2nd. If the payment is not made after the deadline, it will be considered a waiver and will not be accommodated.</p>
<p>Distribution of Rice Collection Certificates in the Education Sector</p>
<p>The first batch of subsidized rice collection certificates for the education sector will be distributed today (the 28th) at No. 306, Jing'an Building, Jing'an Temple Road. Each unit that has been approved for sale should have the person in charge bring the seal and payment receipt to collect it. After each unit obtains the rice collection certificate, they can go to the designated rice distribution point to collect the rice. In addition, the second batch of subsidized rice can also be applied for at the same place from today. Institutions that have been approved for the first batch of allocation, if they still hope to allocate in the second batch, must re-apply.</p>

<h3>Beyond Severe Penalties: One Solution for Stabilizing Prices</h3>
<p>— Song Qing</p>
<p>During the American Civil War, Lincoln once said to Secretary of War Stanton, "In this critical moment, those crazy Wall Street speculators are still gambling on the rise and fall of gold. What do you think? I would suggest cutting off their heads one by one." Unexpectedly, the price of gold jumped by more than a quarter. "Governing a chaotic world requires severe penalties" is a principle that is generally approved, but it is more a "technique" than a "way" to govern chaos. There is a difference between these two. Yu the Great's skills in repairing dikes and dredging channels were techniques for controlling floods, but his idea of channeling the water into the sea was the way to control floods. The way and the technique are mutually reinforcing. Having the way without the technique meant that the wise sage Wang Anshi could not avoid failing just before success. Having the technique without the way is exemplified by Lincoln's failure to control the price of gold.</p>
<p>The difficulty of governing a chaotic world lies primarily in the hardship of the people's livelihood and the soaring prices. The weak inevitably suffer and die, while the strong take risks. The decline of social morality and the collapse of law and order all stem from this. Once this trend starts, whether forced by circumstances or not, officials will inevitably engage in extortion, and merchants will hoard goods for profit, which has become a new standard of morality. High prices force people to do evil, and doing evil in turn fuels prices, creating a vicious cycle that has led to the current state where people have no means of survival. Therefore, the way to govern a chaotic world is to prioritize managing prices and stabilizing people's livelihoods. Officials must be able to live above the level of starvation before severe penalties can be used to make them honest and just. Merchants must be able to operate under stable prices without the risk of asset devaluation before severe penalties can be used to prevent them from hoarding goods. It is rare to see officials who are selfless when hungry, or merchants who sacrifice their fortunes for the public good. It is inappropriate and impossible to demand such things. Based on the above arguments, we conclude that stabilizing prices requires more than just punishing hoarding and wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Apart from hoarding and other human factors that exacerbate the problem, the main reason for high prices is the wartime shortage of supplies, where supply cannot meet demand. Whether the shortage of supplies is due to the interruption of supply sources, difficulties in transportation, or the stagnation of production, it is certain that any attempt to actively solve the problem from the front will be met with obstacles under the current special circumstances. The experience of the past few years has shown that production increases and transportation improvements are unattainable. The only way to solve the price problem now is to address the issue from the perspective of distribution, namely, reducing consumption. All progressive countries have followed this path, as can be seen from the small amount of food rations given to the people in Germany and Japan. The German and Japanese planned economies that are admired by many are simply about allocating consumption based on the possible supply. There is no other way to stabilize prices in our country; otherwise, in a situation of scarce resources, everyone taking enough to consume will inevitably lead to supply not meeting demand. As a result, the price mechanism will only raise prices to complete two missions: (1) Raise prices to force people with weak economic capacity to reduce or even stop consumption in order to match the supply. (2) Raise prices to induce the flow of goods. The latter will lead to rampant hoarding and reduce the supply. The former will create a distorted situation where the rich have feasts while the poor starve on the streets. Why not reduce consumption together under a reasonable distribution system to achieve the principle of not worrying about scarcity but worrying about inequality? The following plan is based on the situation in urban areas.</p>
<p>Distribution and Consumption Plan</p>
<p>(A) Resource Management: To ensure the reasonable implementation of distribution and consumption, resource management must be strictly controlled to prevent abuses.</p>
<p>A. Agricultural Products: (1) All agricultural products entering the city must be purchased by the government, and individuals are not allowed to purchase them privately.</p>
<p>(2) The purchase price will be based on the current black market price in the city, including the price at the place of production, the transportation costs of individual traders, and profits. Once the price is set, it cannot be changed unless there is a change in transportation costs.</p>
<p>B. Industrial Products: (1) All existing and manufactured industrial products in shops, stores, and factories must be graded and controlled by the government. Individuals can only resell them in bulk and are not allowed to sell them to consumers privately.</p>
<p>(2) The prices of industrial products will be assessed by the government.</p>
<p>C. Raw Materials: (1) Those that flow in will be purchased by the government, the same as agricultural products. Those in stock and manufactured will be registered and controlled by the government, the same as industrial products. Individuals are not allowed to do so privately.</p>
<p>(2) The price of raw materials will be assessed by the government, the same as agricultural products for those that flow in.</p>
<p>(B) Exchange of Agricultural and Industrial Products: The cost of reproducing agricultural products is mostly based on the consumption of industrial products. Therefore, the rational and mutually beneficial exchange of agricultural and industrial products is the key to stabilizing the prices of agricultural products and ensuring smooth purchases.</p>
<p>A. Anyone transporting agricultural products or raw materials to Shanghai for sale will be allocated industrial products of equivalent value.</p>
<p>B. The allocation price will be based on the black market price at the time of setting the purchase price of agricultural products, and once set, it cannot be changed.</p>
<p>(C) Consumption Allocation: The consumption volume of citizens must be allocated by measuring the possible supply of various resources. Therefore, a rationing system must be enforced. For example, according to various statistics, the possible inflow of rice into Shanghai each year is such that each person can only consume an average of five scoops of rice per day. This average amount will be allocated to each citizen. The same applies to industrial products such as cloth and socks.</p>
<p>A. Agricultural Products: (1) Citizens can purchase a specified quantity of rice, grains, and other items from retail rationing stores on specified dates with a ration card.</p>
<p>(2) The allocation price includes the purchase price and profit.</p>
<p>B. Industrial Products: (1) Citizens can purchase a specified quantity of items from ordinary stores on specified dates with a ration card. They can choose the grade of the items at their convenience, and the price is based on the government's assessment. (Daily necessities such as matches will be sold through designated rationing stores.)</p>
<p>(2) Stores can apply for goods with the ration cards submitted by citizens.</p>
<p>C. Raw Materials: (1) Raw materials will be allocated by the government to manufacturers.</p>
<p>(2) Manufacturers should also submit a warehouse receipt for a corresponding amount of finished products to the government at the same time.</p>
<p>Supplementary Plan</p>
<p>(A) Food and Fuel Allocation Issues: Whether it is possible to reduce the consumption of rice and firewood without violating the conditions for survival is worth considering in detail. "Not worrying about scarcity but worrying about inequality" is certainly a golden rule, but it is meaningless if the scarcity is not enough to sustain life. This question can be answered from two aspects. The first aspect is whether the citizens' food consumption can be reduced from the current amount. In fact, it is undeniable that Chinese people eat a lot. From what the author has seen in the Northeast, one Chinese person's meal can be equivalent to the meal of two Japanese people or even a family of three (husband, wife, and child). Their vegetable dishes are not rich, just two preserved plums, one or two slices of raw fish, and a small bowl of clam soup. As for cooking oil, it can be said to be minimal. During peacetime, it is still necessary to reduce consumption a bit. Why can't we do it now? Moreover, from a scientific point of view, absorbing excessive carbohydrates does not benefit health. Therefore, reducing consumption is not a problem. The only pain is that the stomachs that are used to being full feel a little uncomfortable when not filled. After a considerable period of correction, this feeling will disappear. When it comes to reducing fuel consumption, it is really a question of whether the technology used is rational. If one family uses 30 catties of firewood per day, 10 families can use only 150 catties if they burn together. It is also not a problem.</p>
<p>The second aspect is that, according to the general situation, the possible supply of food and fuel in Shanghai is not so drastically short of the normal consumption. However, hoarding, competitive purchasing, storage, and uneconomical consumption have increased the difference. If attention can be paid to the following issues, the degree of reducing consumption can certainly not hinder the conditions for survival. (1) Rice, wheat, grains, and even root vegetables and rice products such as rice cakes and rice noodles should all be distributed to citizens in the form of main foods, not as supplementary foods. Because people in the Jiangnan region look down on grains, they are more wasteful in their use, which is not right. (2) All delicate snacks on the market should be banned and can only be exchanged for rice and grain ration cards. They cannot be sold privately. The application for raw materials for workshops will also be based on the ration cards submitted. (3) Restaurants selling rice should also exchange them for rice and grain ration cards and should not sell them privately.</p>
<p>(B) Industrial Product Allocation Issue: In addition to daily necessities such as matches, other industrial products such as clothes and socks can be reduced as much as possible. The meaning of reducing consumption is not only to save raw materials but also to leave them for supplying the countryside as much as possible in exchange for agricultural products. The quantity of consumption allocation will be based on this. There are many kinds of industrial products. Whether luxury goods that are not daily necessities should also be rationed, such as silk stockings, woolens, and cosmetics, seems unnecessary on the surface. However, because those who buy luxury goods are all wealthy families, and wealthy families have smaller appetites and higher food storage. It is fair to exchange what they have for what they lack. Therefore, it is advocated to adopt an application and allocation system to exchange for rice and grain ration cards. For semi-essential goods, it may be possible to adopt an application and allocation system for recovering old utensils.</p>
<p>(C) Exchange of Agricultural and Industrial Products: (1) Purchasing agricultural products based on providing industrial products is not only rational and necessary but also a fact. At present, any individual trader transporting goods to Shanghai will inevitably purchase industrial products to return to their hometown. This principle is beyond doubt. Regarding the exchange rate between the two, we insist on using the black market price at a specific period, rather than simply evaluating the production cost. The reason is that first, we do not want to create new changes to stimulate the market, and second, the exchange rate of this black market price includes the supply and demand factors of both parties. Since the exchange rate of this price includes the supply and demand factors of both parties, it should be possible to maintain it unchanged forever unless there is a change in supply and demand. The price of these industrial products is obviously higher than the production cost price assessed by the government. The extra profit can be kept as a subsidy fund for future changes in the exchange rate. (2) According to the above-mentioned exchange function, it is easy to have a misconception that since the principle is mutual benefit, there should be no problem with the inflow of agricultural products, or that the inflow of food can be induced by controlling the price of industrial products. This misconception arises from neglecting the following factors: A. Possible supply of agricultural products (excluding military rice and consumption by rural producers). B. Possible supply of industrial products. C. Possible minimum living consumption in urban areas. D. Possible voluntary reduction in consumption in rural areas.</p>
<p>(D) Raw Material Allocation Issue: During periods of resource shortage, although raw material allocation is different in nature from consumption allocation, it also has its economical use. (1) Manufacturers with production efficiency below the standard will be suspended from allocation. (2) Manufacturers of non-essential products will be suspended from allocation. (3) Manufactured products must be simplified and economized, such as socks must be short, undershirts must be sleeveless...</p>
<p>The above plan is completely based on the current situation. The so-called purchase of agricultural products is nothing more than changing from scattered purchases to collective purchases. The so-called control of industrial products is an expansion of commodity registration. The so-called consumption allocation is nothing more than the promotion of the current rationing system. The so-called reduction of consumption is nothing more than reducing the waste of the rich to help the poor. The so-called exchange of agricultural and industrial products is an ironclad fact, and the determination of the exchange rate is just to stop artificial manipulation. It does not conflict with the facts but is just a rational revision and promotion, so its implementation is very possible. However, its shortcomings must also be recognized. The most important thing is that consumption allocation only focuses on the urban end, and it cannot impose consumption restrictions on rural producers, nor can it directly allocate industrial products to them. Friction will inevitably occur in the exchange of agricultural and industrial products, affecting the overall effect. Only by deepening political power can we achieve completeness.</p>
<p>Although the economic future of this city seems peaceful on the surface, it is actually brewing a crisis. The price of rice has exceeded 10 levels. How can the people in dire straits withstand another blow? The thorough solution to the people's livelihood problem cannot be delayed any longer. I hope that insightful people will give me guidance on my limited view.</p>

<h3>A Beggar Child on Yongshou Street Has Been Sheltered</h3>
<p>Our office received a letter from Mr. Wu Jingyi stating: "Dear Sir, several months ago, a couple with a child were sleeping under the eaves of a building across the street (No. 142 Yongshou Street). I heard that the couple were from wealthy families, but they became beggars due to their addictions. The child is very filial, supporting his parents with what he scavenges. Later, unable to withstand the wind and rain, the parents died one after another. The child is alone and helpless. However, judging from his qualities, he is not bad and seems to have received education. He disdains associating with beggars and has never begged from anyone. He has been supporting himself by sleeping on the streets. Such a promising talent, if society does not shelter him, may go astray and repeat the mistakes of his parents. Therefore, I dare to write a letter to briefly describe the situation, hoping that your office and the relevant childcare organizations can provide assistance and find a way to shelter him so that he can become a useful talent, which is a blessing for society."</p>
<p>(According to the letter received from Mr. Wu, our office immediately wrote to the Shanghai Fu You Orphanage, asking them to investigate the matter and, if it was found to be true, to provide shelter. Our office will provide a monthly subsidy from the funds for assisting suffering children. We have now received their reply stating that they have sent staff to investigate and found that the child's parents have indeed died and he has fallen into the streets, which is in line with the regulations, and he has already been sheltered.)</p>
<h3>Donation of Gifts from Classmates for Charity Sale</h3>
<p>A person named Shanjushi wrote: "Dear Sir, in this turbulent world, the people are extremely distressed. I deeply admire the various charitable activities organized by your office. I am ashamed that I am unable to contribute even the slightest bit. I recently received a gift from my classmate Chen Shunquan, including half a dozen towels and two cans of Quaker oatmeal, as well as other food items. It would be disrespectful to refuse them and I feel ashamed to accept them. Except for the remaining food items, which cannot be priced and I can only thank him, I have sent half a dozen towels and two cans of oatmeal for charity sale, estimated to be worth about 5,000 yuan. All the proceeds will be donated to the poverty relief fund for the benefit of the people. I hope you will publish this letter so that people from all walks of life will respond and expand the effectiveness of the relief efforts. I hope you will consider my humble sincerity."</p>

<h3>Discussion on Tai Chi Chuan Experiment</h3>
<p>Under the leadership of Mr. Chuan Zhongwen, the Yongnian Tai Chi Chuan class organized by our office, despite the severe cold weather, the students are energetic and continue to practice every morning. Recently, in order to encourage the students, Mr. Tang Zuxiang was specially invited to the site to briefly describe the experiment of Tai Chi Chuan. Mr. Tang said: "When practicing Tai Chi Chuan, attention should be paid to maintaining the 'upright, correct, and comfortable' posture and intention. Otherwise, the center of gravity will be lost, and it will be easy to fall. The movements should be continuous, and the breathing should be slow and gradual. This can promote the smooth flow of Qi and blood without stagnation and can also help with the Kung Fu of resisting acupuncture points. According to Tai Chi Chuan, the method adopts the Taoist principle of softness conquering hardness, which is helpful for cultivating Taoism and self-cultivation. When practicing, the 'mind, intention, and spirit' should be gathered, the heel should be firmly planted, the head should be upright, the Qi should sink into the Dantian, the waist and shoulders should be relaxed, and the fingers and hands should be in shape but not exert force. The so-called light and clear Qi that rises up is the sky, and the heavy and turbid Qi that condenses down is the earth. The upper body should be light and the center of gravity should be kept in the Dantian. In short, practicing Tai Chi Chuan requires walking in a circle, following nature, and not forcing yourself. Understanding this principle will gradually lead to health."</p>

<h3>Tao Yuqi's Charming Demeanor, Enthusiasm for Rescuing Child Refugees</h3>
<p>According to the news from the China Child Welfare Association, Mr. Tao Yuqi, a member of the association, delivered a donation of one million yuan from philanthropist Dong Dashanshi yesterday. Among them, 500,000 yuan is designated for the education and upbringing expenses of two child refugees, Yang Xinmei and Zhang Boyu, and the remaining 500,000 yuan is used for the living expenses of other child refugees. Mr. Tao has always been very enthusiastic about various charitable causes, and he is especially concerned about the education and upbringing of child refugees. Now, in view of the extremely tight funding of the Child Welfare Association and the difficulty of maintaining it, he has once again enthusiastically run around to solicit donations, which is commendable. Mr. Dong Dashanshi's generous donation of a large sum of money and his emphasis on giving are also commendable. In addition to the receipt issued by the association, we also express our gratitude to Committee Member Tao and Philanthropist Dong Dashanshi on behalf of the child refugees who have benefited.</p>
