<h3>政府對停戰先決條件　共軍須撤離鐵路綫　恢復交通俾難胞返鄉</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山二十九日廣播稱：中國國共兩黨，今日未續舉行談判。此係因中央政府尚未能答復共黨方面停戰請求之故。據稱：中央政府將向共黨提出要求，在停戰前，共黨必須撤出鐵路綫，由警察維持治安，以便恢復通車。</p>
<p>〔合衆社重慶二十九日電〕預定之第二次國共會談，今日並未舉行。自權威方面獲悉：該會談因國府當局，尚未答覆共黨之停止內戰要求，而未曾舉行。官方解釋謂：因外長王世杰招待馬歇爾特使之雞尾酒會，亦適於同時舉行，故未及開會云。據權威方面息：國府大體可接受共軍之停戰要求，但附帶一重要條件，即共軍必須自其鐵路佔領區內撤退。國府方面以爲此事實爲必要，俾恢復交通，使難民可以絡續返鄉。國府並同意派遣路警，以代軍隊，在鐵路區維持秩序云。較爲樂觀之政界人士謂：一切重要問題，可於國共談判中討論解決，政治協商會議，僅將成爲形式上之跳板而已。</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶廿九日電〕歲序即將更新，中國前途究將和平統一，或發生全面內戰，尚在未定之天。但此間希望頗爲濃厚。美國駐華特使馬歇爾來此已八日，極度表示樂觀，渠相信國共現正繼續作空前讓步。但悲觀者則認爲未來政治協商會議，討論國共懸案，以求一勞永逸之計，未必有何成就。各政黨人士凡與馬氏談話者，均發生一種印象，以爲渠對於今日各種問題之背景，校其所承認者更爲熟悉。</p>
<p>政府早建議停戰　共產黨今知倡亂軍力不足　突然改變態度以拖延時間</p>
<p>〔路透社重慶二十九日電〕國共於今日恢復談判時，蔣主席對共產黨三點停戰建議之答覆，屆時可望提出。同時某政府發言人（並非國共談判之代表）則已駁斥共產黨之建議，據該發言人稱：國民政府於十月二十一日即已提出此等建議，共產黨今知其軍力不足擊潰我方，故不得不突然改變態度矣。目前全國及國民政府所渴望解決之緊急問題，乃交通綫之恢復，及日軍之解除武裝，與日本軍民之遣送歸國。政府於六星期前，即曾建議共產軍撤離鐵路六哩，鐵路綫由警察守衛，政府擬沿鐵路綫運軍時，當先知照共產黨方面，預料此次談判時，政府仍當堅持此兩原則。又據可靠方面息：周恩來於星期四訪馬歇爾特使作兩小時之晤談時，曾談及政治協商會議，及東北等兩大問題。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處重慶廿八日電〕紐約前鋒論壇報記者斯蒂爾本日稱：蔣委員長正在考慮中國共黨之正式書面停戰提議，共黨某發言人告記者，該項文件業於昨夜國共兩黨代表歷二小時之會議中提出。共黨昨晚拒絕發表彼等之書面提議原文，僅稱政府方面已同意將該項建議轉交蔣委員長，並稱星期六日或將召開第二度會議，以便進一步檢討考慮中各項問題。昨夜會議內容尚未透露，政府對其代表所提建議保緘默。政府方面雖與共產黨同樣表示亟願戰事立即停止，唯堅持恢復鐵路交通，及共軍自彼等控制或威脅下之鐵路地段撤退至一定距離之外，政府最關切者，則可沿華北鐵路輸送軍隊及給養而不致受阻。最近停戰談判之成敗，或將視共黨對於鐵路交通問題所願作之妥協，究達何種程度而定。共黨謂彼等之提議爲無條件性質，唯俟提議全文發表後，公衆自有定評。昨晚之會議爲共黨代表二週前自延安返此之首次國共代表正式會議。此乃爲政治協商會議淸　障　之數次會議之一，衆信討論召開政協會議亦爲昨晚議題之一。政府代表爲張羣及國民參政會秘書長邵力子，共黨代表爲周恩來，葉劍英，王若飛等。美特使馬歇爾昨邀共黨代表周恩來共進午膳，並聆取中國之政局詳情，旋參加美代辦勞勃生之歡迎宴會，席中馬氏曾晤國民黨，共產黨，民主黨代表曁無黨派人士。</p>
<h3>華北郵電火車　新價暫緩實行</h3>
<p>〔中央社北平廿九日電〕宋院長蒞平，對於穩定物價極爲重視，頃已決定華北郵電火車元旦實行新價一事暫緩實行。</p>
<p>〔聯合社北平廿九日電〕生活費日益增高，乃華北民衆今日最感滿苦之事，物價雖一度跌落，但在十月間即又回漲，薪水階級尤受打擊，甚至前任大學敎授竟有拉黃包車者，彼等每月薪水爲僞聯鈔二萬元，僅值美金四元而已。此間公務人員，分爲兩種，一爲重慶派來者，一爲當地錄用者，待遇各別，亦爲不安原因之一。國民黨北平紀事報建議，根據生活指數，提高當地雇員待遇，失業問題亦因國共問題而不能解決，據估計單在北平一埠失業者，即有十萬人，政府已在北平開始辦理失業登記，但迄無直接救助辦法。紀事報促請宋院長注意一點，略謂：「若輩長此失業，有被中共徵發可能，政府應不咎旣往，許其自新」．</p>

<h3>三外長會議打開僵局　五强會議下月召開　美英蘇關係大見改善</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約廿九日電〕紐約泰晤士報今日載稱：中美英蘇法五强或將於下月在倫敦舉行首次會議，討論各項計劃，以便規定必需之國際軍隊，維持和平。該會各項計劃，現正經由外交途徑討論中，英國政府居於發起地位，但其他大國如中美蘇法等，是否接受，尚不可知。五强提早開會，意義重大。　目下全體國家對於戰後軍事設備，均具永久性質，而該會最大考慮者，將爲陸海空軍之數量問題，五大國均將被請對於聯合國機構軍事設備，有所貢獻。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿九日電〕此間外交界人士希望五强軍事代表會議，將於一月間舉行，討論設立國際和平保安隊，以符聯合國憲章規完。英國外務省對於召開此項會議旣不否認，亦不證實。但權威方面揣測聯合國大會一月十日開會，組成安全委員會後，軍事委員會將及早開會云。</p>

<p>〔中央社倫敦廿八日專電〕自十月間五國外長會議陷於僵局以還，三閱月以來，一般充滿相當悲觀情調，惟至今晨三時，美英蘇三國外長於莫斯科會議中所建偉績之官方公報發佈後，未來國際間可獲合作之信念，復見增强。一般評論除一二例外，咸抱樂觀。多數觀察家，均認此次會議爲一「驚人之成就」，「和平之新開展」。英國舉國自波茨坦宣言以來，對於任何官方公報，均未有對此次莫斯科公報之表示歡忭者。一般英明之觀察者，成認會議中蘇聯一方面及英美一方面，均具顯著互相讓步及協調之精神，惟若干批評家則强調英美對蘇之讓步居多耳。</p>
<p>〔中央社記者湯德臣紐約廿七日電〕美朝野對莫斯科公報之初步反響，可稱之爲「審愼之樂觀」，大都認莫斯科協定，對三國合作，尤其美蘇合作之一般空氣，將有遠大之影響。然美評論家，旋即指出歷次會議後，因實施協定，而常引起之困難，最後必須再舉行會舉，此次會議結果，尚稱完滿。僉以（一）三外長已打開倫敦外長會議中之僵局，（二）外長會議將再度召開，（三）前參加歐洲作戰之廿一國，將會商歐洲和約問題，姑勿論會議在三國控制之下。（四）在打開三國尤其美蘇對管制日本原子彈及朝鮮之佔領與中國問題等之癥結方面，均獲進步。現實家觀察，此項會議結果認爲係蘇聯之勝利，蓋蘇聯始終堅持將來之戰後解次方案，雖非完全由三國決定，三國亦應有特權。然另一方面此輩現實家又作自慰，認爲英美對蘇之讓步，已獲得補償，即蘇聯與聯合國組織之加强合作及全世界問題之解次，應藉多方面之方式也。僉信美蘇問互相猜忌，將由此消除。綜上所述，美人僉信莫斯科協定，爲一大進步，但希望此次勿再如前此發生因實施協定而引起之條款解釋問題。</p>
<h3>保守原子彈秘密　美國至今仍未改變初衷</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿九日電〕杜魯門總統將贊助逐步透露原子能秘密辦法，較莫斯科三國公報最初印象所指示者，更爲審愼。總統於聖誕假期內，曾赴密蘇里州與家人團聚，甫經歸來，一般曾與談話者，對成立國際管理原子能委負會計劃，即作如是解解。據稱；杜魯門主張美國常應確知小秘密並不妄用，方可揭示更重要之秘密。總統府及國務院內談話，指示美國政策將先試騐所提議之檢查方法，然後以關於原子炸彈之一切秘密，告知任何國家，惟英國加拿大除外。據共和黨參議員范登堡宣稱：國務院曾告以國際委員會處理原子能問題，需要充分安全。范氏係參議員原子能專門委員會委員，主張保留此項秘密至證明國際管理可防止其供軍事應用時爲止．莫斯科三强會議公報，對於所擬成立之委員會曾提出四點，此委員會將由聯合國機構設立，對世界安全理事會負責。其四點如下：（一）由各國交換基本的科學情報：（二）管理原子能以確保其供和平用途；（三）消滅原子炸彈及可致大量破壞之其他炸彈；（四）用檢查及其他方法建立有效保障，以保護遵約各國，防止冒險，破壞及規避。范氏謂：彼所以反對公報者，因其原來用意，不在使此項目的照所提四點依次採行，但應全部合併讀之，每點應有充份安全之必要，且須全部經國會最後批准，彼之主張在國會中當可普遍接受云。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿八日電〕貝爾納斯離莫斯科前，曾以警告口吻，表示美岡並未放棄其關於原子彈之任何秘密，但渠確表明美國願在獲進原子能之平時應用方面，居領導地位。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿八日電〕關於莫斯科會議對原子能問題之決議，民主黨參議員范登堡今日於會見杜魯門總統及代理國務卿阿契生後宣稱：據官方意見，處理原子能問題時，每一步驟皆將以「完全安全」爲前提，且保證各階段最後均將經國會核准云。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿八日電〕關於莫斯科三國外長會議所成立之協定，參院原子能及外交委員會委員俱表示，欲更知其詳。共和黨參議員奧斯汀告記者稱：在原子能委員會中，有一種「極强烈之感覺」，須徐緩進行，即非俟覓得有效控制方法，保證原子能不復用於破壞之事，然後可洩露或交換任何關於原子能應用於工業上之詳細情報。蓋原子能在工業上之應用，在原子彈製造手續中，已佔其四分之三。</p>
<h3>對日措施　麥帥未作批評</h3>

<p>日本驚惶黯然失色</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿八日電〕莫斯科三國外長會議各項決議業已發表，日本各界對於討論此事，無不表示驚惶詫異，黯然失色。多數觀察者對國際管理日本機構之創設，表示恐懼。某日本報紙稱：日本人歡喜並信任麥克阿瑟元帥，今恐其若干政策將爲中蘇兩國掣肘，日本人久已受過敎訓，對此兩國不免恐懼懷疑，東京方面對日　裕仁之命運，亦漸增恐懼。日本各界均回憶中蘇兩國前曾提議使日皇遜位之計劃。</p>
<p>韓人反對託治制度</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓二十八日電〕美國朝鮮委員會今日表示：三强所訂管治刺鮮五年之計劃「爲」惡劣之圖謀，其中不能有自由存在」，該委員會主席林上校謂：此項計劃「與此次戰爭中中·美·蘇·英國民曾犧牲生命而力爭之目的相背離。此等國民係爲自由而捐軀，但託治制度並非自由之謂，而係監督與統治」。</p>
<h3>保外長宣布　接受蘇建議</h3>

<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿八日電〕重慶華人方面，對於三外長會議各項協定，表示歡迎，特別是與中國有關係者，希望能保障中國在東九省之主權，並加强中國和平統一之期望，關於及早撤退美蘇兩國軍隊一項協定，華人方面認爲蘇軍之撤退，勢必延遲，美軍則俟日軍繳械遣送回國後，將立即撤退。關於朝鮮問題，中國官塲意見謂：中國常主張朝鮮獨立，但不贊成在五年託管期內劃分朝鮮爲美蘇兩個管領區云。</p>
<h3>杜魯門總統　聽貝爾納斯報告</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿八日電〕華盛頓方面今日俱認爲外長會議協定，係世界和平之另一「里程碑」。華盛頓官方及外交界俱歡慶倫敦外畏會議失敗以來僵局之打開。僉信英美蘇之關係，已大爲改善，華府所焦急之目前數主要世界問題之解決，將使明年一月十日聯合國大會舉行時，國際合作之希望，更見光明。杜魯門總統今日自密蘇里返華府，渠將接獲貝爾納斯之報告，貝氏預定明日抵此。杜魯門總統於明日將乘總統遊艇，往華盛頓南四十五英里處之折撒比克灣，消度五日，貝爾納斯未返前，國務院拒絕解釋或說明各方所詢關於盟國對日委員會及加諸麥帥之限制之甚多問題，杜魯門之報界聯絡秘書羅思今向報界稱：白宮尚無充分時間，獲取全國反響，然至今尚未獲得滿意之批評。</p>

<p>〔本報東京廿九日專電〕據傳日政府最近曾請求准許日方遣派外省代表三人至中國，以便處理賠償中英美戰事損失問題，此種傳說業經此間否認。又日政府請求盟方將前任東條秘書三人自中國遣返日本，已被送回日政府聯絡處，須俟適當時機，再行提出。東條之三秘書姓各如下：（一）赤松，（二）西尾，（三）服都。據稱日政府擬將此三人調回，以便爲東條作證。盟方宣稱，此項請求係由東條律師提出當可予以考慮。</p>

<h3>英決助荷恢復　東印度秩序　促使印花談判獲致諒解　英荷會談結束發表公報</h3>
<p>〔中央社倫敦廿九日路透電〕英荷關於印度尼西亞問題，進行之會談現已結束。唐寗街十號首相官邸發表聲明稱，英政府重申其協助荷蘭盟邦及早建立安全狀况之義務，藉使荷印政府繼續與印度尼西亞代表進行協商。英荷政府曾會商促使印度尼西亞民族運動領袖及荷蘭當局間獲致諒解之政策。今後並將即時採取其他步驟，以保警印度尼西亞境內戰俘及被拘僑民之安全。</p>

<h3>對莫斯科三國外長會議　美英蘇三國興論　譽爲世界之一重大進步</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿八日電〕美英蘇三國報紙今日對於莫斯科三國外長會議之成就，譽爲趨向眞正和平世界之一重大進步。各報且一致稱原子協定爲最重要之成就。日本管制一事，在莫斯科及美國幾乎加以同樣注意，但在英國則漠然顧之。蘇聯外長實爲日本管制辦法中勝利者，故莫斯科之評論最爲熱烈。消息報稱：各項協定在趨向聯合國合作途徑中，係一種新步驟，無此步驟，即無穩固之和平。倫敦各報論調，亦大約與此相同，較之秋問倫敦五國外長會議失敗後之滿紙憂鬱，恰成顯明對比，僅每日電報提出警告，謂勿以爲一切困難均已解除。倫敦會議固顯然過於惡劣，茍造成此次會議之坦白友好精神，不能維繫不墮，則莫斯科會議亦將以過於圓滿，而令人難以置信。泰晤士報稱此次會議爲顯著成功。每日郵報則以爲有極佳朕兆，顯示各國漸復互相信賴，願意妥協。華盛頓晚報謂美國　已重大讓步，在日本佔領政策中，尤爲顯明．因此種　步，日本種種困難之解次，將不復依循美國政策，而麥帥已變爲遠東委員會之代理人，惟盼國務卿貝爾納斯在此重大嚴步中已獲得有利條約，作爲交換。該報又反映一般意見稱：原子協定或爲會議中最重要成就，但其效果如何，尚待事實證明。蘇聯眞理報社評稱：遠東委員會之組織，有重大意義。四國管制日本委員會亦爲事實所必要，管制委員會應將日本軍閥保全一部份實力之企圖，予以打銷。舊金山記事報稱：原子協定使驚恐時期或國際之　戒與不信任態度已成爲過去，功能恢復世人心理，使重新建設與和平改造之工作，可在現實之情緒中進行。關於此事，聯合社分析家自倫敦來電稱：原子彈出世，使國際款　橫生，焦灼如焚。前次五國外長會議之失敗，無疑即造因於此。今次莫斯科會議決定去除此種疑慮，即此一端，已顯示會議大獲成就，但會議中似尚有若干微妙重要之困難問題，懸而未決。蘇聯對伊朗及土耳其之關係，亦在其內。此二問題，有世界重要性，且充滿火藥味云</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐約廿八日電〕霍華德系報紙今日以明確之立塲，反對莫斯科之協定。其中有一社評稱：「美國又對蘇聯大作讓步，而自身則一無所得。」該系作家賴摩爾謂：不論其爲妥協抑係計劃，四强管制日本之協定，殊屬混亂不堪。麥克阿瑟或尚能爲力，設以一魄力稍弱者，則其手足將受莫斯科所造成之立法緊衣所束縛矣。「紐約太陽報」稱：「莫斯科協定之眞正試騐將見諸日後，貝爾納斯與貝文是否業已說明蘇聯爲安全計而作相互之讓步，則尚不可知。一華盛頓郵報」稱：「莫斯科會議之結果，使美蘇關係之退化抑制。目下所議定者。爲蘇聯在日本管制委員會與遠東委員會中具有發言權。此種辦法，決不致于涉麥克阿瑟之日常行政工作。」「芝加哥日報」稱：「全部協定中最有希望之一點，即美蘇兩國均宣佈將儘速將其軍隊自中國撤退。」</p>

<h3>國土重光國軍推進聲中　迴溯東北之命運　展開當前復興建設事業　上篇·本報資料室特搞</h3>
<p>每一個中國同胞，都伸長着他們的頭頸，睜開着睽睽的目光，密切注視着東北的接收工作之完成，國軍空運工作之推進。「那一天國軍才得開入瀋陽？」幾乎是每一個東北同胞和全國同胞心目中自然形成着的熱辣辣的問號。同時，憑着他們的堅次信心，久已確認這是即將實現的肯定的事實。正因爲這事情必然會實現，所以他們的期待也就更痛烈，更深切。</p>
<p>我們都明瞭東北是我國之不可分而且不可劑的領土之一部分。遠自開戶開放政策中經過九國公約，以至近年舉行的開羅會議，無論其爲聲明或協定，都一致以東北爲我國之主要領土爲前提，以東北是我國工業化現代化之根據地相期許。因此，我們現在所關念的，不是我們在八年抗戰之後幾時才完成妝復故土的問題，而是怎樣使這一片苦命重重的故土復舊改觀，以期成爲未來和平幸福之保障而不爲未來世亂之根源的問題。</p>
<p>在這一個基本認識和重要信念之下，追溯東北之命運，實在有其深長的意味。現因手頭資料貧乏，姑以中央設計局東北調查局之東北涉外史料爲監本，略加本人的管見，作一簡要的槪述。</p>
<p>歷史的陳跡</p>
<p>中國之東北，即歷史上有名的滿洲，其地位於亞洲大陸東部之中央，東面約當東經一百二十度至一百三十五度之間，南北約當北緯四十度至五十三度之間。此地遠在中國周朝即已與中國本部發生關係，其後歷朝未斷，然滿洲民族與中國人民中之漢族至淸朝入關後，始由地理上之迎繫經濟之互通而至精神上之完全結合。所謂精結合，即指血統結合，文化結合，思想結合，與生活習慣等結合而言。</p>
<p>蓋滿洲人百分之九十九已與漢人同化，其大多數已隨淸朝入關，散居內地十八省，以至新疆內外蒙等地。經三四百年的揉合，已無復自辨其爲滿爲漢。至現住於東北之人民，據敵寇日本之統計，約在四千三百餘萬之數。其百分之九十以上，殆均爲漢族血統，其餘則爲漢滿混合血統，及前所提及之少數純土著人。</p>
<p>在一九三一年九一八事變之前，中國未嘗因疆界而與其鄰邦日本及蘇聯有何爭執，爭執之根源乃別有所在。</p>
<p>日俄之覬覦</p>
<p>一八九四年，中日兩國因朝鮮內亂，致失和陸，而起戰爭。一八九五年戰事，以我國的失敗而結束。馬關條約迫中國割讓遼東半島以爲賠償日本之一部，日本對東亞大陸侵略之野心，即於此肇端。同時，對此一部中國領土伺隙者，尚有沙皇時代之帝俄，亦野心勃勃，時思染指。遠在中日戰爭以前，俄國已窺伺中國之東北及朝鮮海岸，迨日本進取遼東，帝俄勢難袖手，乃聯合德法共同干涉，迫其退還。</p>
<p>一八九六年之中俄秘密協定，即爲俄國干涉還遼之索價，依此協定，中國允俄國在東三省北部築一鐵路，（即中東鐵路）其兩端應與其西伯利亞鐵路，（一八九一年開始一九〇一大部修成）接通。因此，鐵路之興築，俄國乃取得許多之特殊權益，如所謂地帶之土地權護路軍護路警及市警權，行政司法權，林確開採權，以及鐵路附近電綫敷設權，免稅减稅及敎育權等等。</p>
<p>一八九八年，帝俄乘中國有事，乃進一步要求建中東路支綫，北起哈爾濱，南至大連，並要求旅順大連爲租借地。迨一九〇〇年，復藉口中國拳匪之亂，出兵東北，事後延不微兵，終於引起一九〇四年—一九〇五年之日俄戰爭。此次戰役，俄國戰敗，與日本締結普茨茅　和約，將旅順大連及中東支路之南段，（即自長春起至火連止之一段），轉讓日本。</p>
<p>四度締密約</p>
<p>自一九〇七年起，至一九一七年止，十年之中，俄國與日本四度締結秘密協定，暗中劃分東北爲兩國之勢力範圍，即所謂南滿歸日，北滿歸俄是也。在此十年之內，日本先吞併朝鮮，繼參加歐戰着着勝利，而俄國則內有政治革命之危機，外遭對德之敗戰，至一九一七年帝制推翻，共黨當政。彼時西伯亞赤白黨戰旣起，於是各國出兵干涉，而日本亦參加在內。</p>
<p>一九一九年七月二十五日，蘇聯政府爲請求中國的汝認，曾發宣言放棄一切在華的權益，其在東北之權益及中東路，亦在其內。一九二〇年十月二十七日，蘇聯政府再發聲明，內述對華訂交之條件，以此兩文件爲緣起，乃有一九二四年五月三十一日中蘇協定及臨時管理中東路辦法之締訂。不幸兩國未能更訂原期訂定之詳細條約，而一九二六年有伊凡諾夫干涉軍運之舉。一九二九年在哈爾濱有蘇聯共黨之陰謀，終於引起是年兩國在東西國境之武力衝突。十二月二十二日中蘇簽訂伯力議定書，雙方停止武裝行動。依該議定書兩國應在莫斯科舉行會議，商決中東贖路問題。不幸此項會議，由一九三〇年五月起，至一九三一年，九一八事變發生止，由於蘇方之遷延，及多生枝節，迄無結果。</p>
<p>陰謀與事變</p>
<p>日本帝國主義者在東北之行動，自一九〇五年以來，自謂係根據該年十二月二十五日北京條約及所謂「議定書」，（事實上並無此一議定書）。自一九一五年後，更有所謂二十一條換文。此一中日換文，雖由日本武力壓迫，彼時總統袁世凱簽字，然爲國會拒絕未予批准。依照中國彼時適用之憲法，凡未經國會批准之條約，固不能生效。此一問題，中國曾提出巴黎和會及華盛頓會議，雖彼時列强因畏於日本之暴力，迄未能正式逼迫日本撤回，然道義上各國，固久已直中國而非日本。日本藉口於懸案不決而發動之九一八事變，除暴力外，更無任何根據之可言。</p>
<p>九一八事變之初，日本所倡之口號爲解決中日懸案。迨其軍事行動得手，乃暴露其本來面目，旣製造「事變」於前，又製造「傀儡國」於後。「滿洲國」實爲日本武力佔領我東北後之統治上與折衝上之方便名詞而已。</p>
<p>一九三四年三月一日，溥義稱帝。一九三五年三月二十三日，日本收買中東路協定簽字。七月十五日，日偽簽訂經濟協定於長春，成立日滿經濟共同委員會，以爲日本開發東北經濟之太上顧問機關。九月二十六日，取締英美銀行。一九三六年六月十一日，日僞簽訂新協定，以漸進的廢除治外法權爲名，日本取得在滿住居旅行從業及土地等一切與滿蒙人民同樣之權利。至一九三七年十一月五日，日僞正式訂約廢除在滿治外法權。一九三九年十二月三十日，日本又與汪逆精衛密約簽字，確定汪逆必須承認僞滿。一九四一年十二月八日，日寇對英美宣戰，同時鼓動汪逆僞滿亦對英美宣戰。</p>
<p>痛心的現象</p>
<p>受盡了這些年來苦難命運的同胞們，渴望我國軍之順利開入，自然是情理中事，但最可痛心的是，共軍在東北瀋陽鐵路綫上的破壞搗亂行動，迄今未見切實停止，蘇軍瑪林諾夫斯基將軍又以大連不是他所管豁的軍區爲詞，表示不能對大連接收事宜有所協助云云，加以國軍空運東北之工作，在本身上規模就已龐大，所以這次遲遲的推進，實在不能不「令人生不耐之感」（見本報廿四日北平專電）了。在無可奈何之情緒中，我們希望這一切都能在元旦以前，在最迅速的方式下，完成了閃電式的推進。（全文未完，下篇明日續刋）</p>
<p>瀋陽城的熱鬧區</p>
<p>瀋陽爲東北之商業中心區，自建城以來，已歷二千餘年，人口密度，較東北其他區域爲多。設有醫科大學一所，設備頗稱完備。</p>
<p>東北古代傳統藝術結晶</p>
<p>東北民間居屋，寺院及行政機關屋頂，門戶，或牆壁間，往往雕刻着傳統象徵意味濃重的調刻，足以覘見我國民間生活與宗敎情緒之一斑。圖示：喇嘛之壁上石刻，拔術殊爲精緻。</p>
<h3>慘霧籠罩柏林　饑餓，絕望，疾病，死亡　孤苦難民在廢墟之中掙扎</h3>
<p>穿過殘破的柏林街道，一路上滿目都是瓦礫，垃圾，和廢墟，最後你便到達火車站。在你局圍的全是些戰後餘生，飽嘗辛酸的德國難民。他們的身上散發着饑餓的恐慌與疾病的臭味。空洞的眼睛裏反映出他們半瘋狂的心境。他們籠罩在一種　惡的沉默中。</p>
<p>你開始從這羣亂的人們中找出一個人來和他談話。他的臉上立刻發出一種償怒和失望的閃光來，你知道他有一番慘痛的經歷要訴說。別人也來參加說話了。大家談着，也有呼囂的，也有哭泣的，疲乏的臂膀做着姿勢，而德國難民的刧運也就複映於我們的限前了。</p>
<p>雖然聯合國軍政府曾經頒佈命令，禁止新來的人進入柏林，可是只在一個月之中就有五十五萬德國難民違令過境，造成不少紛擾，而</p>
<p>過境的德國難民</p>
<p>仍在每天增加着。約有一千萬在戰時流離失所的德國難民，正在遭遇同樣的命運。</p>
<p>從蘇聯集中營裏釋放出來的戰俘，被捕克人驅逐出境的蘇台德區德國人，從波蘭境內被趕出來的全體德籍少數民族，東普魯士西利西亞的居民，以及俄德河以東爲戰事的狂流所捲來的幾百萬男女老幼，在一種可怕的威力之下，被驅向柏林境內而來。</p>
<p>每天約有一萬五千人，由三四班火車運到柏林來。車頂上，車檔間，甚至踏脚板上，都擠得滿滿的。在理論上，原是有一個　關，專門來　　這班德國難民的，替他們檢騐身體，供給他們飲食，並且指導他們的行止。這是一個德國機關，因爲在聯合國方面看起來，這純粹是德國人自己的問題。可是在實際上……讓我們到火車站去看看究竟是怎麼一回事罷。</p>
<p>下午六點鐘，東來的列車平巳誤點了，還是沒有到。一個德國站員以爲今天不會到得太遲的，因爲已經快是下班車的啓行時刻了，而事實上又只有</p>
<p>一列車來回駛行</p>
<p>最後，火車終於到了。</p>
<p>難民們從車上慢吞吞地下來，慢得出乎你的意料之外。經過了幾小時極痛苦的旅程之後，他們現在蹣跚地　散着，疲憊的眼睛裏充滿着疑問，顫抖的（往往裹着創傷的）手裏提着他們僅有的一小包行李。赤着的脚，紅腫着，佈滿着血痕和汚跡，也有用破布來裏着的。有人穿着他們最好的「星期日鞋」，也有人設法抓到一雙堅固的旅行靴子。</p>
<p>充耳一片德國語：『現在</p>
<p>我們要到那兒去</p>
<p>才好呢？」「你能告訴我……嗎？」「我餓極了！」是的，他們餓了，他們也需要喝水。有一兩個德國紅十字會辦事人受了包圍。他們想幫助難民們，回答他們的問話。可是他們實在也無能爲力。難民們已經有好幾天沒有吃東西了，這兒仍是沒有什麼可以給他們吃的，他們都快要餓死了。飲水也十分缺少，而且汚濁。也沒有烹飪用具。</p>
<p>不久，這班新來的難民們就和昨天前天就來的連合在一起，跋涉着；經過柏林而去。仍有許多人留下在火車站，憔悴，無依，徬徨，絕望。</p>
<p>「你們是從那兒來的？」哦，簡直是不忍卒聞。他們有千百種不同的經歷，而他們以悲慘的命運却是相同的。行李呢？一個年輕的女孩子怒聲叫了起來：『那些該死的波闌人……統給他們偸光了！』可是，我們也該想起，當德國侵入波蘭時，德軍是怎樣地蹂躪着這個戰敗的國家。</p>
<p>「你看他—八十歲了，瞎着眼，六親無靠……」他們的境遇是一個此一個更糟。他們損失了一切，沒有吃，沒有穿，身上發着臭，衣服上生滿着蟲子，還有一個女孩子在途中受到了强姦。因爲在這條路上有成羣結隊的波蘭孤兒，在戰事期間失去父母，無人敎養，流爲</p>
<p>作奸犯科的暴徒</p>
<p>他們備着刀和手槍，專事搶刧難民，掠奪他們僅有的一些東西，如錶，戒指，皮夾等。錢却搶不到，因爲離民們都沒有錢。那些成年的暴徒們還往往乘危奸淫單身的女子。你很容易認出這種女子來，她們欲哭無淚，簡直瘋了。</p>
<p>誰來招顧道班難民呢？嚴格地說來，柏林市政府的社會局原辦有四十八處臨時收容所，預備</p>
<p>每天收容三萬名</p>
<p>難民的。可是有的因爲發現傳染病而遭封閉了，有有被聯軍當局徵用了，其餘的，雖然存在着，也因爲飲食歡缺，不能按照預定的計劃，對於過境難民供給半磅麵包和兩派因脫湯，同時，因爲醫生太少，也不能檢查他們的建康。難民多數患着痢疾。</p>
<p>究竟有多少難民收容所呢？許多人在路上失蹤了。許多人沒有氣力前進了。也有許多人想仍舊搭火車回到老家去，看尚有什麼東西可以檢回來的沒有，所以他們就在車站裏躱下了。當你在他們中間聽他們訴苦時，他們會忽然挿插道：「看見嗎，那邊，有人快死了！」那兒是第二號月台的遺址，戰前每天有一百班列車進出，從來不會誤點的。現在呢，一輛裝牛的貨車，已經改爲一輛「屍車」了。車上裝潢着已死和垂死的人。死人身上貼着條子，上面寫着：『屍體待收』。</p>
<p>出了車站，難民們先到柏林市政廳，檢查身份證，沒有身份證的，重新補領，並且決定他們預備到什麼地方去。在那兒辦事的，只有二百人，却要對付二萬人當然是来不及的。『這是你的號碼，明天再來』，對於許多人，明天永遠沒有來過。明天再來的人們，伸長着頭頸，拉長着耳朶，等候呌喚他們的號碼。輪到了時，在他們陰沉的臉上就浮露出一種刹那的欣慰來，同時，他們呆滯的眼睛也</p>
<p>閃　出一綫希望</p>
<p>的光。可是疑問又來了。遵從聯軍的指導是不是聰明的辦法呢？別處究竟怎麼樣呢？謠言很多：『你看見那些路旁的屍首嗎？還有那些吊在樹上的屍體？』死神不但威脅着柏林，並且潛伏在任何什麼地方。然而多數人仍舊寄託他們的希望於將來。將來還會更糟嗎？離開這兒，到隨便什麼地方去，終不見得會比這兒更糟吧？</p>
<p>凡是要到英美區去的，必須先向柏林的聯合國軍政府申請核准。同時，未經蘇軍發給出境證的，又不得離開柏林。因此，柏林街頭充滿着走頭無路的難民，手裏拿着各種證件，來回地擁擠着，掙扎着。一個德國軍官，從蘇聯的戰俘營中釋放出來。</p>
<p>千里跋涉到柏林</p>
<p>不知道故鄉曾否遭到轟炸，要子是否健在。他詢問着，希望着，終於耗盡最後一點精力，僵倒在回家的路上了。路上也有骨瘦如柴的母親和嬰兒，也有瞎了眼的，或是斷了手脚的敗兵。他們希望別處的情形會好一些。可是，在戰後的廢墟裏是不會開玫瑰來的。</p>
<p>柏林的火車站裏每天有成千累萬的德國難民從失望中運來，又有成千累萬的德國難民離開柏林被運人新的失望中去。戰後的德國到處都是饑餓，疾病，失望，，和死亡，不論天涯海角，德國難民的命運都是一樣的。到今天，他們已經飽嘗了納粹主義的苦果，跟他們終身詛咒納粹戰魔的罪惡去罷！</p>
<h3>英吉利海峽秘密利器　海底輸油管內幕　水陸兩樓式偉大發明</h3>
<p>盟軍在法國諾曼第登陸反攻期間，直搗東歐納粹巢穴的英美機械化部隊，其汽油供應，取之不竭，用了不盡，這眞是一件奇蹟！德國偵察機在英吉利海峽上空，竭力搜索盟軍油糟船的踪跡，可是盟軍的裝甲部隊依舊猛進不已。英國這戰時輸送汽油的驚人秘密，現在倒底被洩露了。英國人呌這種秘密東西爲「百路多」（Pluto），說得顯明一點，那東西便是海底輸油管。</p>
<p>海底運油方法　敵人們全不知道</p>
<p>這種空前的輸油方法，敵人一些也不知道。一九四四年夏季到冬季，從英國經過海底，運往法國的油量，每天有一百萬加侖。嗣後又延長到比利時，荷蘭，甚至深入德國本土，直到曼因河上的弗蘭克福城。</p>
<p>好像諾曼第海外先前建成的桑子港一般，「百路多」是從英國科學頭腦和英國工業界共同發明的結晶品。</p>
<p>「百路多」也在秘密中計劃成功，遠在德軍總總司令倫資台德的軍隊在德本土崩潰數月之前，便　有油管四條橫渡英吉利海峽，　接着偉德島和法國的瑟堡港，同時還有十六條油管，從鄧琪耐司經過長三十哩的海峽，連接着法國的蒲勞臯，直達安特衛浦和萊茵區域。</p>
<p>對於這「獨一無二的方法」，前英首相邱吉爾說過：「這個方法，在敵人海岸邊供應汽油，實與把桑子港當作一般軍需品的供應站，有同樣的便利。他還說：「百路多」輸油方法完成，是英人的絕大成就，也是英人可以自傲的水陸兩樓式工程的技巧。</p>
<p>汽油作戰部長　提出輸油管問題</p>
<p>倫資台德元帥和其他被俘的德軍將領，都承認德軍的慘敗，大半是爲了盟軍方而汽油供應佔警人優勢之故。大家公認，英吉利海峽那邊需要大量汽油，但汽油和油糟船，都是受敵人海空軍攻擊的最佳目標。</p>
<p>在一九四二年的四月裏，在秘密中工作的汽油作戰部部長勞埃特，早有這種意思，他曾問過路易爵士。對於油管問題，可否有辦法？所得的回答是：「可以的，你能否在英吉利海峽底下舖設一條？」勞埃特問了許多專家，他們都說不可能。海底油管需要高壓力的帮浦站，在經濟方面，是不可能予以預算的，油槽船比較便宜得多，而且在激流汪汪的英吉利海峽底下舖設油管，因爲每天氣候在不斷變化，而且潮水也太急速。在工程上是一件驚人的事情，冒險的成份是極大的。</p>
<p>工程師赫德萊　化「不能」爲「能」</p>
<p>話雖如此，可是這是戰爭，一切都需要非常的處置。不久以後，便有一個專家想出一個實行的計劃來了。此人名時赫德萊，是「英（國）伊（朗）石油公司的總工程師。他的計劃是在海峽底下，用海底電綫舖設船，舖一條類似海底電報綫的管子，祇消改成空心，去除「絕緣」或「隔離狀態」便行。在二十四小時內，這種獨特的管子，便有好幾百碼在西門子工廠內　造成功。不到半月功夫，一艘郵局的電綫鋪設船，已在泰晤士河，却脫姆附近，開始它的試騐工作。</p>
<p>「海司」（赫德萊—英伊石油公司西門子）合造管子的偉大成功，足使英人更發生擴大試騐的野心。另一家海底電綫公司，名呌「亨脫萊司」的，立即加入合作，可造成一種長三十哩的油管，舖在史潢西和伊爾弗拉康勃中間的勃立司脫爾海峽底下。那裏的環境·形勢，和英吉利海峽是相同約。</p>
<p>一九四二年十二月，力足以拖帶這樣重而異乎尋常的大油管的大船，被配備成一般海底電綫舖設船。取名英皇家海軍「堅持」號，經過許多困難，在「北德文」海岸邊，風平浪靜，伊爾弗拉康勃那一端。油管裏的油，涓涓不絕地湧出來了，可見這計劃是可以實行的啊。</p>
<p>這是一次通盤計劃的實騐，管子的直徑擴大到兩至三吋，輸送挺力加强到每方吋一千兩百磅以上，同時英國皇軍服務隊的技工人員，竭力研求高壓帮浦和儲藏按術上的一切手續方法。</p>
<p>漢密爾式油管　亦宣告實驗成功</p>
<p>除此之外，另一種油管也同樣經過試騐，這種油管是根據緬甸石油公司總工程師愛立思和伊拉克石油公司總工程師漢密區合同設計造成的，取名「漢密爾」式，在國立物理實騐所，由各工程公同協助試騐之下，長二十呎的三吋式管子，可以溶接到任何長度，可以捲在圓種上，再拉直。圓桶的直徑，至少要三十呎。</p>
<p>爲試騐這種方式，海軍部首先把一只小船改造爲「剖西風」式船，在甲板上配置一巨輪，可在桶耳上旋轉。然後再製造一種浮的鼓形輪，用以携帶足敷全海峽長度的管子。史都華和勞埃子工程廠，便依照了這個設計，開工建造，同時剏設一廠，專事將長二十呎的管子溶接至四千呎的長度，每天裝載到十哩長度的管子。</p>
<p>「百路多」部隊　兩主要基地成立</p>
<p>六個巨大的鼓形輪製造成功，取名「英皇家海軍康能桶」，簡稱「康能」，停泊在油管最末一節處，使得四十呎的長度，可以鎔接成三十哩或三十哩以上的聯貫綫。當滾動時，可以有條不紊地捲在「康能」上。每一只「康能」，重一千六百噸，長九十呎，直徑長五十尺，可以帶七十哩長的油管。現時携帶油管的桶子，直徑是四十呎。</p>
<p>上述兩種式子的油管，在一九四三年四月問試用成功，皇家海軍便開始舖管工作，「百路多」部隊同時成立。它的主要基地，在南辛潑頓，第二基地在鐵爾勃萊。一百個軍官，一千艘商輪，在海軍部指揮下參加工作。各級船隻，自一萬噸重的到各種小船，摩托艇，應有盡有。「康能」用以處置漢密爾式油管，海斯式油管則由四艘特地改裝過的商輪携帶，另用泰晤士河的小船在岸邊協助，因爲那裏的水太淺，大船難於活動。</p>
<p>運赴前線油量　超一萬二千萬加侖</p>
<p>即使是那兩只駁船拖曳着蜿蜒地橫渡海峽的「康能」，也沒有被德人攻擊過。德國的空軍，以爲這些是不值得注意的東西。等到蒲勞臯收復。水雷清除以後，差不多有五百哩長的油管，把蒲勞　和鄧琪耐司又連結起來了。瑟堡的油管，乃退於次要地位。皇家工程師那時裝置一大組聯貫性的油管，歷經北部法國，比利時，一直到安特衛浦，於是乎汽油可以從利物浦碼頭上的油槽船，通過油管，直接輸送到萊茵區，到盟軍開出最後一槍的時候爲止。經過這條油管，直送到最前綫部隊的油量，已超出一萬二千萬加侖以上。</p>
<p>盟軍佔領區內　均應用「百路多」</p>
<p>這些「百路多」油管，現在還全部應用着。每天仍有一百萬加侖左右的油送給佔領軍和解放區的人民，至是是否將照此繼續到將來，那無所謂，因爲這本來是英國工廠的急救工作，效率和成功都達到最高度的一件工作，同時，大批油糟船得以抽出去，對付了太平洋上的抗日戰爭。（本報編譯室銘譯）</p>
<p>東北之煤，爲全境產量最豐之礦產，總額達二千萬萬公噸。其次爲鐵。他如：金，鋼，鐵，沙金之類，儲藏量亦極豐，甚至足供百年之需用。</p>

<p>最近上海市國藥商業同業公會整理完成，依法召集會員代表大會，修訂章程，改選理事監事。因發現被選舉人中，有會在本市淪陷期內担任該業公會理監事職務者頗多。當時某機關出席代表，援引懲治漢奸條例第十五條「曾在僞組織及其所屬機關團體担任職務，未依本條例判罪者，仍應於一定年限內，不得爲公職候選人，或任用爲公務員」之規定，認爲曾在淪陷期內，　選爲公會理監事者，此次不得有被選舉權。因是，當日該會選舉無法完成，理監事不獲照章產生，會員大會遂致流會。此事發生後，上海市正在整理改組中之一百九十餘同業公會，因大致其有相同情形，都不敢定期舉行會員代表大會，辦理改選，完成整理工作，惟有相率觀望。抑有進者，現任一百九十餘同業公會之整理委員，係經山各該同業公會推出加倍人數，報請上海市商會審核，轉呈社會局圈選三人至七人，遴派爲各該公會之整理委員。就中聞不乏曾在淪陷期內膺選爲各該公會之職員者·如果一概不准充任公職，則目前受命担任整理委員，似即已爲非法。因之，意志消極，羣思引退。不但整理工作，無從推進，而日常會務，亦將停頓。全市工商業之基層組織，均將入於活動停止狀態。今常復員伊始，百廢待舉，無一不須運用各業公會，發揮組織力量，以求策進效能。如果各業公會無形中行動發生障礙，不可謂非當前之嚴重問題。而欲考查癥結，先須辨別：同業公會是否與任何政治組織其有隸屬系統？</p>
<p>查過去僞組織，仰承敵人鼻息，對我行政系統，社會組織，破壞更張，不遺餘力。自太平洋事變之後，敵偽勢力，侵人租界。上海市商會即被暴力刦奪，派員接收，旋即改組偽市商會。其於各業同業公會，則未嘗作同樣之接收。因僞組織亦深知同業公會爲各該業之基層組織，由同業之公司行號，加入爲會員。推派商店主或經理人爲會員代表·向來充任理監事者，必其人具有經濟條件與服務能力，在同業中信用經歷允孚衆望，方克膺選。同業團體之性能，固與一般社會團體之以個人爲會員本位，參加與否悉憑個人意志者不同。其組織有歷史性，固定而少變化。非可以暴力一旦摧毀，亦非可憑好惡率意改造。僞組織因此，對各同業公會未敢擅加刼奪。各公會雖瓜代及期，辦理改選，亦不過業中人自爲更迭。偽組織時代，固未嘗發現指派任公會理監事之舉。蓋知情勢有所未能也。故同業公會之情形，與僞組織行政統屬下之商業統制委員會，米統會，棉統會等性質，截然不同。蓋前者爲同業之公益集團，歷史悠久，職員係由同業公同選任，以維持增進其同業之公共利益，及矯正弊害爲宗旨。而後者爲僞組織之經濟集團，係敵僞惡勢力手造之一時組織，其職員係由偽組織所聘派，以幫助敵僞搜刮物資，統制分配爲其職志。在淪陷時期，淪陷區之工商業，橫受敵僞之摧殘迫害，而憑藉惡勢力之奸逆，又復刼奪剝削，敲骨吸髄，無所不用其極。工商各業，旣失祖國之保障，在黑暗氣氛籠罩之下，籲天無門，入地無路，所恃抱殘守缺，僅有各該業同業公會，猶爲同業風雨同舟相與砥礪之所。然在當時身任理監事者，不顧「明哲保身」之古訓，在敵僞鐵蹄蹂躪之下，忍辱負重，屛障同業，爲公衆機牲，此種孤臣孽子之用心，實有足多者。而况在此時期內，上海市各同業公會，均能不忘祖國，配合黨政地下工作，處處不與敵僞合作，均有過去史實可證。舉凡獻金，勞軍，公債，寒衣捐等等，凡大後方所發動倡導者，本市各業公會，均不避艱險，熱烈響應，幾於無役不與。最後一次之勸慕美金同盟勝利公債，於三十年秋，中央勸募委員會派員至滬，本市各業公會幹部同志，立即展開響應工作。其時已在太平洋事變前夕，敵偽勢力，早已侵入租界，各業公會，均仍不辭萬險，各自以春記華記化名，滙款至渝，認購公債。爲時不數月，應募總額，竟超出大後方任何繁盛都市。當時應募人，只取得一紙銀行滙款收據，不計其他。至今前項全部債券，尚保管在渝，仍由保管委員會彙總保管·未嘗換給認購人·即此一事，已足徽滬上各業人士，眷念祖國，情緒熱烈，誠爲民族正氣，彌足珍貴。而在當時淪陷巳久，迫脅嚴重之上海，有此貢獻，尤屬難能足稱，值得大書特書。</p>
<p>史稱「漢高入關中，約法三章，與民更始」。茲值河山再造，天日重光。過去敵僞嚴刑峻法，百倍贏秦，而民望來蘇之熱忱，亦遠勝古昔。故目前收復區第一要政，在於安定人心。嚴忠奸順逆之辨，申勸善罰惡之誡。過去工商界，自亦不免有若干敗類，利令智昏，爲虎作偎，憑藉敵僞勢力，侵漁同業，搜括物資，作惡多端。至今有巳被覊押，正在審理中者。有仍爲漏網之魚，猶待檢舉者。吾人對此等害羣之馬，無恥敗類，主張盡法懲治，不稍寬貨。惟於多數善良商人，必須安撫綏輯，加以鼓勵。對於過去公會之理監事，迹其行事，如別無憑藉勢力，損害祖國者，應憫其遭際，不事苛求，如果含垢忍辱，掩護同業，不辭危險，眷顧祖國者，更當念其苦心孤詣，特加表彰。</p>
<p>此次國府頒布「懲治漢奸條例」，計共十六條，言簡而意賅。細揣法意，深合「殲厥元兇，脅從罔議」之精神。第二條，首言「通謀敵國，而有左列行爲之一者，爲漢奸。」其次列舉罪行十四項。文意明澈，絕無混淆，所以杜株連牽累之弊，法意至明。立法技術之善，允稱前所罕見。至原條例第十五條法旨，在於充任僞組織之官吏，或其所屬機關團體担任職務者，其行爲縱不合於第二條列舉十四款中之任何一軟，未能按例判罪，但身爲國民，認賊事仇，接受僞命，充任僞職，亦當處以名譽律。在「一定年限內，不得爲公職候選人，或任用爲公務員。」至此，只須一問：同業公會，是否爲僞組織「所屬」？公會理監事，是否爲僞組織所任命之僞職？固知同業公會爲人民團體，不屬於偽組織，亦且並不屬於任何時期之任何政府機關。理監事係由會員所選任，而非出於僞組織之委派。原條例重在「所屬」兩字，殆指商業統制會等等僞組織隸屬下之團體而言，與同業公會，不相牽涉，法意甚明。</p>
<p>再查同業公會爲法人，按諸民法，爲公益性之社團法人。其理監事之地位，實與同法所稱財團法人，營利事業之公司董事監察人，初無二致。政府對於收復區戰時新興之公司，原在僞組織註册者，許其補行登記，對董事監察人，更米聞加以干涉，然則對於社團法人之公會理監事，豈宜有所軒輊？參證十一月廿三日曾經公布之「處理漢奸案件條例」第二條，第十項：「敵僞管轄範圍內之文化、金融、實業、自由職業、自治或社會團體人員，憑藉敵偽勢力，侵害他人，經告訴或告發者，」尤足證明淪陷區之人民團體，同在敵僞管轄範圍之內，但均無隸屬關係，而其是否構成罪嫌，則須視其行爲是否「憑藉敵僞勢力，侵害他人，經告訴或告發」以爲斷。</p>
<p>基上種種，已知僅任淪陷期中同業公會理監事，而別未參加偽組織所屬機關團體者，並不適懲治漢奸條例第十五條之規定。工商界同人，無庸自爲惶惑，或轉生怨懟。而主管官署，負有指導監督之責，亦必能按之法理，不致牽强混淆，轉滋紛擾。</p>
<p>最高領袖會剴切闡釋經濟建設之重要，期望工商界自爲主體，發揮自動力量。宋院長更强調提示工商界不可存依賴心，須以團結力量，達成經濟圾高理想。目今復員建國，經濟復興，萬緒千端，所期各業，負有時望，具有經騐，能發生領導作用之各業中堅，共同負荷使命，配合國策，以把握此千載一時之良機。株連興訟，自古所戒。何况當國家需才孔殷之今日，無故摧毀人才，即爲國力之損失。吾人不可不三致意焉。</p>

<h3>金市漸形呆定　游資爭購美鈔　證券帮拉抬華股</h3>
<p>烚赤昨起仆範圍更窄，業內外對於新正期中，掛牌必可實現之揣測，殊爲堅定，一般心理認爲滙率一經訂定，黃金勢必有長時期之呆滯，紛紛轉移目光於美鈔及華洋股票，以致金市轉形呆定，鮮有特殊變動矣，晨開平疲，曾盤小至八〇萬五左右，後以美鈔又起哄動，掀動買風，回好至八三萬光景，惟以假期在即，散戶逢高脫售，難於支持，午刻退至八一萬五左右，午後在八一萬內外掙扎，結果較前收微挫五千，銀樓飾金掛八萬七，紋銀仍爲六百元，銀元以銷路略呆，退至四百四以下，小頭者更低十元，暗折平定，求供亦見平衡，大致過年頭寸一角，普通九分左右，業外需求者息價較高，約一角至一角二分。</p>

<h3>許承基無恙</h3>
<p>〔中央社倫敦廿八日合衆電〕</p>
<p>新聞晚報訊：台維斯杯中國選手許承基，保有英國硬地網球錦標，渠於戰時以失踪聞，刻安然無恙，渠將設法保持一九四六年之錦標。許氏於戰時在巴達維亞留居多年，經常仍練習網球，若渠得與一九三九年硬地網球決賽中，爲其敵手之蔡惠全搭配，則可成爲爭取台維斯杯有希望之中國選手。</p>

<p>讀者來函</p>
<h3>失學青年們的呼聲　請臨大先修班主持者予以考慮</h3>
<p>編者先生：我們謹以十二分的至誠，向貴報懇借寶貴園地的一角，來登載着我們失學靑年所要說的話，不知先生能允許否？「言而有信」這是中國固有的美德，也是人人應該遵守的一個信條，誰知堂而皇之的一個偉大學府，竟會事與言違呢！先生！這不是一個奇怪的消息嗎？昨天我在貴報的敎育與體育的一欄裏，看到臨大先修班舉行入學試騐，其原因是爲了「報名者過多，校舍不敷應用，加以各生蹬件，間因原校不復存在，一時難於核對，勢須舉行入學試騐，以資甄別」，但是回看臨大先修班的招生簡章裏，並沒有報名過多，必須加試的一條，或證件不合，必須加試的一個附註，反之我們看到他的招生簡章裏，是多麼的同情失學靑年，是多麼的關懷失學靑年，他在待遇的一項下，是學費免收，膳宿自理，（經濟來源斷絕之學生，經審查確實後，由本班呈部予以補助，）我們對此一項的優待，眞要感極而涕了，正因爲此我們具着很大的希望，冒着最大的危險，不遠千里而來了，我們拘着求到相當的學識，將來報國家於萬一，方不負此一項優待的大決心，而向臨大報了名，等待通知，預備上課，並向家裏報告校方的如何如何，一切一切，曇花一現，好夢不長，辦敎育的人尚會如此善變，何怪其他的宵小之流呢！我們並非是怕考，我們也並非是發牢騷，不過我們靑年的精神是脆弱的，我們經不起一再的挫折，我們在八年中受到的苦楚，是誰也知道的，敵寇，僞軍，匪徒，層出不窮的花樣，尤其現在我們是有家歸不得的人呀！誰說是勝利？勝利帶給我們的，是什麼？我們祇覺空虛，無望，我們祗覺悲傷，頹唐！本來學校的對於考試，是應當的，我們也不能否認的，但是一二干個學生，就吵着校舍不敷應用，必須加以考試，試問考試落選的學生，又將如何措置呢？這應當怪他的學識不好吧？還應當怪他沒有進僞校，或是到大後方去呢？進偽校恐於思想有關，到大後方去是經濟不會允許，好在臨大先修班的招生簡章裏的第一條宗旨項下，明明說着爲高中畢業之失學靑年補習學業，準備升入大學，面資格爲公私立之高中畢業生，而報名手續，爲呈繳畢業證書，相片，保證書等，正因爲學識不好，方來補習，若好的話，何不逕投考大學，而要多此一舉的麻煩呢？若說校舍的不敷應用，何舉辦時並不聲明，本校校舍有限，無把握考取之遠道學生，不必來此，而致遠道學生之往返跋涉呢？更有奇者，在校舍不敷應用之下，而僅可以供給不須考試的「學生不僞」之洗住宿，求學，反之是校舍不敷，必須考試，我不信敎育的對於眞僞，原來就是如此的一斑。編者先生！我在上面說了這許多話，恐未免要得罪了很多的大人先生們，但是假若他是大人先生的話，他一定能够原諒在下的苦衷，因爲我們是從蘇北來的，我們是從匪窟中逃過來的，我們是從萬險的封港的時候偸渡過來的，現在我們北望家園，涕淚交加的一點呼聲，都得不到他們的同意嗎？所以我很希望敎育當局給我們很快的上課，好讓我們在精神上，學業上，得到一個寄託的所在，不要讓寶貴的時光一天一天的浪費下去，我們想信在艱苦困難中的淪陷區的靑年，他們和她們，決不會有負於國家的！編者先生：這是我們失學靑年的一點呼聲，能不能公佈出來，讓社會的正義人士，替我們向敎育當局，作更有力的一呼呢？我們不勝企盼之至！</p>
<p>敬祝　　安！　失學靑年正旭東李振等謹上</p>

<h3>周逆懿爲　高院明日審訊</h3>
<p>粤人周懿爲，當敵僞時代，曾在北四川路日商上海石油聯合支店充任要職，被拘後，經一度偵訊，轉解高等檢察署，經該署偵訊屬實，即依懲治漢奸條例第二條之罪，向高院提起公訴。茲悉該案高院已定三十一日上午，正式開審。</p>
<h3>法幣金條　禁止携赴台灣</h3>

<h3>魏德邁將軍聲稱　東北並無美軍隊　昨招待記者解答各問題</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國戰區美軍總司令魏德邁將軍，昨日上午十一時，在江西路建設大厦八樓事處辦，招待中外記者，答覆各項問題如下：關於助華運兵至東北，現正進行中。杜聿明將軍之軍隊，已由海防運至葫蘆島，但尚未抵東北，現有人員計四千八百名，及車輛四百輛，即擬增運大批軍隊前往。惟時值寒冬，軍隊禦寒設備爲最大問題，如裝備完全，須相常時間。至於配備物質，除一部分係美方借給，一部分爲日戰利品外，均由中國政府自給，即由美方所得者，亦係由中國政府購買。魏將軍並特聲明，在東北並無任何美海軍陸戰隊。</p>
<p>協助建軍不涉其他</p>
<p>關於美軍在華事顧問團，魏將軍稱，現尚未正式組織，華府方面亦無確實消息傳來。但如成立，則其任務全在助華建立海陸空軍，次不涉及中國政府之經濟政治等問題。其總團部將設於中國政府所在地，可能於南京。美軍總部則設於上海，魏將軍本身留華多久，亦不得而知，渠或將負責顧問團創始之工作，而不致爲永久之團長。</p>
<p>嚴厲取締反蘇舉動</p>
<p>有記者訊以近聞若干美海軍人員有反蘇聯舉動，魏將軍稱，當其在南京時，曾聞此事，現正詳加調查中。如有此類舉動，余將嚴厲處罰之。余本身擔任軍事，竭力避免爲一有黨派者，余雖不知每一屬員之個人思想，但深信彼等舉動次無政治作用。</p>
<p>美軍工作不難解決</p>
<p>問，有若干美軍靜坐而無工作者，何時開始工作？魏將軍謂，目前有三個問題如解次。則即有甚多工作：美軍事顧問團尚未正式成立，如成立，則須留一部美軍在華工作。撤退敵人時須甚多工作。中國政府何時派兵至東北，如即開始，亦須美軍人員之協助。美軍留華時間，亦視撤退工作長久而定。至於空軍人員有無飛行機會，則經美空軍總司令史特拉梅耶將軍答稱，現有之空軍官員及士兵均有機會飛行，彼並不知有任何無飛行機會老，如有此淸形，彼頗願得知。</p>
<p>軍人家屬明春可來</p>
<p>有記者訊問，何時美軍人員可　家眷來華？魏將軍謂，其部下亦屢有提出此問題者，但目前尚未接得美軍部指示，如由余負責此事，則余願按此例規定。如有十軍官可携眷屬來華，則應有一百士兵之眷屬同來，惟目前設備缺乏，且缺少學校等供兒童求學，余極希望美軍家屬於明春能來此。一切旅費將由政府供給。</p>
<p>如有犯規從嚴處罰</p>
<p>對於美軍在此時有　禍等情發生，美軍總部已迭次發出警告及處罰，並將繼續執行其規則，惟事實上則頗難管制。他如美軍在此浪費及出售軍用品等情，美當局多方制止，但希望國人亦合作，勿隨便變買軍用品。魏將軍稱，確已採取各種方式，勸告彼等儲蓄，但余頗不願干涉彼等個人自由，同時，此處缺少專門人員作監視工作。余現計劃每日晚間舉行法庭，審訊犯規各人員，不論階級，均有嚴格處罰。</p>
<p>又關於撤退敵軍，估計須美軍一萬二千至一萬五千人，現在華美軍約計八千至一萬人，故尚有若干人員由美來華。至德·奧·等敵人之遣送問題，槪與美軍方面無關。又在華英蘇法等國事務，亦悉由與中國當局自行接洽。</p>
<p>馬使赴平可能來滬</p>
<p>魏將軍又云，馬歐爾元帥赴北平時，可能過上海，因尚有問題需要考查與研究。魏氏以爲馬氏乃一良好軍人與政治家，今次來華，在外交與政治上，均有重大意義。</p>
<h3>無綫電收音機　均須依法登記</h3>
<p>淞滬籌備總司令部稽查處電信監察科負責人稱：管制之目的，首在防止歹徒利用無綫電，傳遞消息，危　國家利益，擾亂社會安寗。以本滬區圍遼闊，機件數量衆多，非從登記着手，無法稽核監察。凡本警備區內任何電豪，收音機，及經售無錢電之廠家，商號，均須依法登記，以憑管理。該科經辦各項手續，均依法令程序處理，務當力求簡捷，予當事人以便利。凡未辦登記手續者，須尅日前往北四川路橋頭大厦伴備總司令部六層樓稽查處該科辦理。</p>
<h3>市商會等團體　電馬帥致敬</h3>
<p>上海市商會，上海地方協會，上海總工會等團體，昨特電重慶美國大使館及馬歇爾特使，對美派遣海陸空軍來華協助之崇高精神，表示感謝。</p>
<h3>美軍撥派船長　遣送日俘</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕爲加速遣送日俘日僑返國起見，美軍當局已調派登陸船六艘，先期來滬，遣送第四批日俘返國。計每船各載一千名，是項船隻業於昨日午後進口，現泊虬江碼頭。預定今日上船，總計四批遣返之日俘日僑，計有一萬七千五百五十名。</p>

<p>市工務局最近在江　淞滬路·黃興路·其美路·東翔殷路·及西翔股路五路交又點之五角塲，試行用機械建築一橢圓形迥旋道。工程開始，已歷數日。工務長趙祖康，爲使本市新聞界明瞭該項機械築路之工程情况，於昨日下午，招待各報記者，前往參觀。首由趙局長報告此次試行機械築路之意義有二，（一）表示市政府對於市中心區之市政建設，仍極注意。（二）提高築路速率，增進建設效能。繼由市工務局第五區工程管理處陳孚華對機械築路工程之按術方面，作簡略報告。</p>
<h3>保險公會整委會　劃一保費拥金</h3>
<p>本市保險業同業公會，由整理委員會接收整理以來，即開始致意於火險費率之整頓。曾幾度召集本市全體同業公司舉行座談會，決定自民國三十五年一月一日起，凡各公司所出火險保險單，一律須照保險單上所載保費數額向保戶於出單日起十天內十足收取，不得再行給予任何折扣，或延長付費期限。並規定給予火險經紀人之佣金，不得超過火險保費之百分之二十。</p>
<h3>徐蚌交通恢復　郵件照常收寄</h3>
<p>上海郵政管理局通知：（一）所有寄往福建區各局所之包裹，小包郵件及圖書小包，均可恢復收寄。（二）啓東·三陽鎭·北新鎭·麒麟鎭·久隆鎭·惠安鎭各局，停止收寄大宗包件，限收個人包裏及個人小包郵件，圖書小包照常可以收寄。（三）津浦綫徐州蚱埠間火車已通，所有寄往徐州及其以南各地之本轉包裹，小包郵件及圖書小包，均可照常收寄。惟去徐州以上者仍應暫停。（四）目前國內各地，水陸運輸，仍有未能暢通之處，公衆交寄信函明信片，凡可利用全程或一部份航空運遞者，請儘量利用交寄。（五）自三十五年一月一日起，上海商行廣告函件收取回信之手續費及保證金數額分別改訂，計開：（一）手續費，每件改爲國幣四元。（二）保證金，每一登記商行所具之保證金改爲國幣四千元。</p>
<h3>漏貼印花稅　逾期依法懲處</h3>
<p>上海直接稅局，以本市印花稅開征以後，多數商號尚未及時黏貼印花，所有漏貼之發票收據等，無法收回補貼，請予變通，願將該期間所有漏貼印花稅額，按照營業額一次補繳，今該局已予照准，並擬定印花稅補繳申請書一種，發由各商號自行申報，經核定應補稅額後，再塡發印花稅繳款書，惟自卅五年一月廿一日起，如再查獲或經檢舉有違法憑證，常即移送法院法辦，不得再行補繳了事。</p>
<h3>錢市長嘉獎　破案得力警員</h3>
<p>錢市長以本市警察局迭次破獲重要盜匪案件，殊堪嘉尚，其中以新成·老閘·泰山·等三分局，成績最佳。殊與地方治安，大有裨益，特擇尤嘉獎，以示鼓勵。新成分局長何培榮，記大功一次，並報銓叙部核定。其餘出力員警各記功一次，發給獎金二十萬元。老閘分局正局長張達，副局長孫家良，各記功一次。其餘出力員警亦各記功一次，並發給獎金五萬元。泰山分局長宋廷均及股長等，各記大功一次，出力員警，發給獎金二十萬元。</p>

<h3>本市軍政當局　籌設勝利博物館　先設籌備委會今日召開</h3>
<p>上海市政府錢市長大鈞，第三方面軍湯司令官恩伯，鑒於京滬區日僑日俘獻繳之古物圖書等，爲數甚衆，擬籌辦上海勝利博物館。先設「上海勝利博物館籌備委員會」，由主辦有關機關派員，另聘本市學者名流組成，定於今日下午四時，假日僑管理處會議室舉行籌備委員首次會議。其籌備委員名單爲：王光漢·孫元良·邵任之·葉恭綽·杜月笙·王曉籟·蔣竹莊·徐悲鴻·陳陶遺·丁福保·蔣復驄·沈尹默·鄭振鐸·謝無量·張元濟·張大千·龐萊臣·徐森賽·王念忱·周鎭實等多人。又悉該籌備委員會負責將書物整理陳列，並決定永久管理人選，及覓定館址，以在市中心區爲原則。同時該博物館組成後，即移交上海市，籌委會即告結束。</p>
<h3>錢市長昨報告　元旦實行車輛告右　統計乘車人數約一百萬人</h3>
<p>（本報訊）錢市長以全國車輛靠右行駛辦法，明年元旦即將付確實施，而木市交通頻繁，車輛乘數，冠於全國。故靠右行駛，更待擴大宜傳，爲便推行盡利起見，昨特假市府大禮堂，招待本市新聞界，出席者有錢市長，何副市長德奎，秘書長沈士華，公用局長趙曾鈺，警察局長宣鐵吾，工務局長趙祖康，李副司令及　，及各中外報社記者五六十人。</p>
<p>鳴放汽笛　校正時間</p>
<p>首由錢市長致詞，略稱：晚近世界各國之車輛，大多係靠右行駛，我國以往靠左行駛，故向國外購入車輛，其駛盤多須改裝，而改裝費須達車價百分之十二，統計全國車輛因改裝而支出之費用，殊爲浩大，故節省改裝費用，亦爲改靠右邊行駛理由之一。又抗戰期間，各地以防空關係，均有防空指揮所，防空情報網及警報之設，戰後此項設備失其效用，今擬利用之以爲喚醒市民之工具，現本市決於明年元旦日起，每日中午十二時正，放汽笛一次，便利全市市民校對標準時刻。至於本市車輛靠左行駛之實施時問，原定本年十二月卅一日晚十二時起實行，茲以是晚適爲大除夕，各界狂歡慶祝中，未便驟然改變，故決定元旦日晨六時正起實施。是日六時正，全市將汽笛大鳴，一切車輛即改爲靠右行駛。</p>
<p>車輛擁擠安全第一</p>
<p>繼由公用局長趙會鈺報告，摘述三點：一、爲報告全市交通設施爲紅綠指揮燈，車輛月台，車站等改裝經過，及改裝之數字。二、爲報告本市各式車輛總數，及乘車人數。據稱：登記之機動車、三輪車、人力車、自由車等，總計達一二七八九八輛，乘車人數則達一百餘萬人。三、爲報告車輛及人數之衆多，首應注意安全第一問題，例如市內行車速度經規定每小時不得超過二十哩，　外不得超過三十里。其他如主意紅綠燈及馬路新劃之黃綫人行道等等。</p>
<p>肇禍案件上月最多</p>
<p>末由警察局長宣鐵吾報告，略稱：本市正由舊式城市向現代都市進展中，以致交通工具新舊雜陳，種類旣繁，數量亦多，而街路又多不合標準，即以南京路而言，已嫌太窄，故目前唯一補救辦法，爲擴展路幅，以至籌設地下電車等，宣局長繼即報告數月來車輛肇事案件，及死傷人數，自九月十二日宣局長接任起，至同月杪爲止，車輛肇禍案件計一三八件，傷九〇人，死四人，十月份肇禍案件爲二九四件，傷一六三人，死七人，十一月份肇禍案件爲三二二件，傷二一九人，死一八人，十二月份肇禍案件爲二三四人，傷一二六人，死九人。總計三個餘月肇禍案件爲九八八件，傷五九八人，死三八人，宣局長復稱：八年戰事，已使本市原有善良之交通管理，破壞殆盡，故現正待積極整理恢復中。車輛違章事件，自九月十二日至同月抄止爲七四件，十月份爲一八五件，十一月份爲一七四件，十二月份爲一三七件，總計爲五七〇件，據稱：車輛肇事地點，以蘇州河上各橋爲最多。</p>
<p>縣掛國旗務求一律</p>
<p>又南京路自實施管理交通以來，肇事案件已較前减少百分之四十左右，預測車輛改爲靠右行駛後，以習慣關係，肇禍案件，可能增多，惟渠將動員全體管員，協助指揮解釋。宣氏末對該局代製國旗及旗桿之事，有所申述，據稱：此舉純爲便利市民，及奉行行政院之訓令而來，今後懸旗須照前頒懸掛黨國旗辦法，切實遵行，故旗幟大小，懸掛方式及地位，均須一律，以壯觀瞻。本局爲便利市民起見，特召集打鐵店及製旗商會談，以最低價格承辦此事。</p>
<h3>地政局辦理土地登記　地產商闡述意見　當局盼業主瞭解立法意義</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市土地，前因租界關係及八年淪陷轉　讓移，產權混淆不淸，今地政局秉承中央意旨，決心整頓，並定期完成全市丈量，規定自本年十一月十九日起，至三十五年一月十八日止，爲登記收件時期，並開徵登記費千分之四，騐契稅照中央規定，估價徵收百分之六至百分十五，錢市長於本月二十三日特發表書面談話，足證當局重視之一斑。自開辦迄今，已一月有餘，而前往登記者，寥寥無幾。日前市商會及各大地產商，銀行信託部等，特集會商討此事。昨記者訪晤地產商，徵詢意見，槪括可分數點：</p>
<p>限期二月時間太促</p>
<p>（一）滬市土地總數，約廿一萬畝，全市業戶約計三十萬戶，現地政處辦理登記僅爲三處，每日每處辦理二百件，每日最多能辦理六百件，則需一年半，始能完竣。今限期二月，未免脫離事實（二）照土地稅規定，登記費僅千分之二，而今地政局規定十分之四，故已由市商會具呈市政府轉呈中央申請減低。關於契稅百分之十五，土地法上亦無規定，故一併請求免徵。（三）估價辦法，係照三十年僞政府之估價作爲依據，每年累計遞增，至本年度爲二百倍，此點多數地產商，認爲應由地政局專家會同本市地產商代表，共同商討，確定估價辦法，予以公佈。僞政府之估價，殊難作爲標準。</p>
<p>買志停頓影響金融</p>
<p>（四）地產爲上海最大之籌碼，金融流通，皆需地產道契抵押，如今登記必經公告二個月，則全市金融，勢必大受影響，且上海地產一向商品化，產權轉讓頻繁，今以契稅之開徵，買賣行將停頓，地價一落千丈，可能引起金融風潮。所有地產公司全部資金，皆已購置地產，如今登記費及契稅如此鉅大，則多數不能償付。按上海地政素極紊亂，有方單（即田單）　單，角單，道契，土地執業證等之分，過去並無整個丈量，道契乃外人應用之永租契，可不完田賦，有圖形，過戶迅速，抵押便利，故多數國人，反將自己產業掛洋行戶名，換取道契。淪陷期間，政府他遷，土地分割，無處受理，故由銀行信託部行代管制度，此後地政局決心將以上兩不合理制度澈底改除，本市地產商對此兩點，頗予擁護。</p>
<p>地政當局解釋意義</p>
<p>惟據本市地政局負責土地登記當局之解釋’則稱立法之用意，要在注重業主與土地之聯繫，故目前亟望「每一塊土地，每一個業主，能與地政當局，直接發生關係，」故切盼業主，瞭解立法要義遵守法令。旋由記者提出問題數點，當經分別答覆關於土地登記期限，據稱依法規定非排第一次所有權登記之土地，不得爲所有權以外之權利登記，故辦理第一次所有權登記，必須力求迅速，而本市開辦登記之六區內，共有土地二十一萬畝，合三十萬坵，其中十餘萬坵，於戰前已發給土地執業證，故賸餘之數，當初估計，可於兩個月內登記竣事，如果登記不及，則以特殊情形，及補行聲請登記等規定，收件期間，實際可有四五個月，時間不能謂不充裕。</p>
<p>申請證件可先發還</p>
<p>至登記所耗之時間，乃整理過程中所不能避免者，且業主申請登記證件，經審核後，原件可先發還，似不致引起任何不便。關係登記費徵收千分之四之解釋，則稱此次辦理登記事宜，須人手頗多，印行表報格式，支出浩大，過去各省慣例，在登記前辦理淸丈，須徵淸丈費，本市則未曾開徵，目前市財政方感困難，該局不得不自　自給，故略事提高登記費，以資挹注。茲經各界要求，已呈市府核減，惟尚未批覆。</p>
<p>契稅可望免予徵收</p>
<p>至契稅中央本亦有先行登記，緩期報稅之規定，後以市府令整理契稅，故併合辦理，深望各業主，先行依法登記，將來登記告竣，依法開徵土地稅後，契稅可望免徵。最後談及土地估價問題，據稱按民國三十年度佔價不過係過渡辦法，即以逐年累計遞增，至最高倍二百倍，其遞增率尚不到一般物價指數增漲率四分之一，據稱正式估價工作，正在着手進行中。</p>
<h3>迭遭橫暴　全市電影院今停業</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市近日時有類似軍人至各電影院要求免費「簽票」，一經拒絕，即對各戲院職員用武，本月中各影院發生事端者已有數起，本市各大小電影院爲對被受傷同人表示同情起見，定今日全體停演一天。全體電影院昨並</p>
<p>發表聲明稱：竊同人等份屬正當商人，對於國家法令，格切遵守，際茲抗戰勝利，天日重光，共欣更始，方慶來蘇，故對於軍人另訂優待辦法，以表吾人對於爲國爲民抗戰英雄致敬之意。詎料竟有不法之徒，假借軍人名義，無理尋釁，對於戲院職員動輒用武，毆辱橫加，更變本加厲，糾衆肄行橫暴，例如本月二十三日麗都·大上海·南京三戲院職員多人遭毆受傷，輕重不等，並將該院生財設備搗毀，種種橫暴</p>
<p>不法事實　備見本市各報刋載，同人等除呈請有關當局對此不法行爲，予以切實制止，並對服務同人予以確切有效保護外，茲經公決，准今天全體停業一人，以表對於受傷同人之深切同情，願黨政軍各當局曁社會各界人士惠加垂　，曲予原宥，並祈扶植正義，以維人權。</p>
<p>又訊：昨日下午五時南京西路大華電影院忽來一身穿黃色戎裝者，自稱某司令部特務隊，因軍餉不敷，懇請支假法幣四十萬，常經經理朱依天再三婉求减少，結果授予法幣十萬元而去。該院負責人昨晚已將經過呈報當局備案。並悉軍警機關對於此輩假借名義，勒索銀款，已通過　嚴緝，務獲究辦。</p>
<h3>紡織建設公司總經理　束雲章發表談話　接收紡織廠即將復工生產</h3>
<p>中國紡織建設公司，已於昨日在江西路一三八號正式開始辦公，聞經濟部特派員在滬所接收之敵僞紡織廠，紗錠九十餘萬錠，及毛錠四萬餘錠，即將移交該公司接管。據甫於前日抵滬之該公司總經理束雲語中央社記者，在上海區內撥歸紡織公司辦之敵僞紡織廠，尚須待與經濟部特派員，及其他有關機關商討後決定，故其數量現尚未能作肯定之答復。惟紡織公司於接管該項敵僞工廠後，當迅即復工，以增加生產量，務使全國人民所需之布疋，得能自給自足。然目前有一最大之困難問題，蓋即爲</p>
<p>動力問題</p>
<p>統計上海其有國營民營（包括敵僞工廠在內）紡織紗錠二百餘萬錠，依現在之動力供應狀態而言，則僅能有半數可開工，故第一步即須積極解次者，爲動力問題。其次爲原料問題，關於原料問題，因美國即將有大量救濟物資運華，故或不致有多大困難。東氏繼談，該公司內部之組織情形，謂總公司已決定設於上海，在天津青島各</p>
<p>設分公司</p>
<p>以接辦上列兩地之敵僞紡織事業。天津分公司經理楊亦周，靑島分公司經理范澄川，均已分別前往成立分公司，並已先上海而將該兩地之敵僞紡織廠接收竣事。此外並在昆明·重慶·沙市·漢口·西安·五地，成立辦事處，於最近將來，並將在廣州·福州·等地設立辦本處，以辦理收買棉花，及推銷本公司之生產品。以後並將視各地情形需要，而分別加設分公司或辦事處，以</p>
<p>擴展營業</p>
<p>在總公司下轄有工務·業務·會計·稽核·秘書·五處，產品即由業務處直接向外銷售。最後氏稱總公司計劃，於兩年後將後接收之敵僞紡織廠，整頓改革上正軌後，分別發交民營，屆時是否由官商合辦，抑全部交與民營，則須視斯時之情形如何，而由當局加以決定。</p>

<p>電影与戲劇</p>
<h3>略論今後的話劇</h3>
<p>— 孟度</p>
<p>話劇在今日好像是已經很興旺的樣子。我不想在這兒詳細討論過去幾十年的話劇運動史。這個題目太大，是我一時解決不了的；且讓比我更能勝任這件工作的人去担負它吧。我只盼望把目前我對話劇的觀察所得的幾點結論加以簡略的說明，順便也帶上我的一點希望。</p>
<p>話劇不是我國固有的東西，它怎麼會在中國生長，它的前途怎麼樣？我們知道，每一民族，國家的文化的變遷都有她的社會的原因。話劇的來，也是這樣。最初的話劇是從日本傳入，時當淸末，由留東的學生發動演劇，藉以排斥滿淸，並鼓吹民族思想。這些老前輩模仿的是日本的「志士劇」，是一種明治維新以來的戲劇形式，「浪人芝居」。那時演的當然大部分是排滿的戲，但也有一小部分的外國戲。到民國以後有幾個比較作風嚴肅的新劇團體都因人事的變化而風流雲散。賸下幾個新劇團也爲了自身的沒有好的領導和一味適應商業環境漸漸退化，沒落，最後竟淪爲遊藝塲的文明戲班了。後來在新文化運動抬頭的時候，話劇又抬起頭來，重又變成靑年學生的時代的寵兒。那時也逐漸有國外回來的研究戲劇的先生們，宣佈了一些外國的話劇情形。這樣爲了本身的需要和外來的影響，在幾個大城市，如北平和上海出現了許多『愛美』劇團，熱烈地研究話劇，演出話劇。演的劇目中有易卜生，梅特林克，洛斯當，王爾德，蕭伯納諸大家的傑作。這個時期可以說是業餘戲劇全盛的時期。在抗戰的前夜，話劇彷彿又回復了淸末『春柳社』時代的狂熱和朝氣。全國各地同時上演着幾千百齣的抗日戲來鼓吹對敵人的仇恨，和正義的報復。接着是八年的長期抗戰，話劇也隨伴着苦鬥了八年。所以我　結到話劇的前途應該還是配合了整個的文化運動的變遷，同時也不能脫離社會環境而單獨存在的。換一句話說，即是，它必須儘可能適合中國現在的國情，盡可能與廣大的觀衆取得協調和一致，儘可能使它在此地能服水土，能深深地根植在我國的土壞中。</p>
<p>其次我想談談話劇的幾個困難問題。目前在上海最令人頭疼的是劇塲的缺乏。在淪陷的時期，因爲英美片被禁，影戲院過剩而改演話劇的有不少家，最多的時候有八九家戲館同時上演話劇，也可見那時上海畸形的繁榮，暴發商人需要話劇正不比別的娛樂差。可是勝利來臨不久，外片又能繼續開映，許多以前改演話劇的戲館都先後開起電影來，戲館老關當然喜歡賺錢，而外片又具壓倒話劇之優越條件，所以以前的八九家話劇突然變了三家，畸形的繁榮突然變了畸零的不景氣—然而根芽冒出了泥土，憑外界怎麼壓抑，阻礙，它仍然會在大石底下曲曲折折地生長的。話劇不值在上海，在全中國的窮鄉僻壤都埋下了種子，抽起新條來了，單受了商人的操縱，摧殘決不能妨害它的發展和生機的。即使在劇院萬分困難的當兒，我們仍可以實現一種「小劇塲運動」，像法國和美國所曾提倡過的，來持續我們的演劇！</p>
<p>因此，比較樂觀些的看法，劇塲缺少固是困難，但決不是話劇的致命打擊，值得研究的恐怕還是觀衆的問題。也就是藝　與生意　的問題。據一位老戲劇家的演講，北京的京戲觀衆在譚老板的時代是多方面的，有着各種生活經驗的，熱的，活的，那就是站在茶園小池子後面的許多趕騾的，趕轎車的；那種情形使他老人家聯想到十六世紀莎士比亞時代的劇塲，後者也是常常擠滿了許多不化錢的平民階層。那末關鍵似乎還在如何造成大家有看戲的能力和餘裕，如何使演出的戲能爲觀衆普遍地接受並且得到益處，怎樣創造使觀衆熱烈歡迎的，有藝術價值的演劇？這應該是戲館經理，舞合監督，導演，劇作家，演員，舞台技術家，以及其他從事戲劇，和關心戲劇的人們常前的重要課題。</p>
<p>這兒我又想到了幾樁話劇的建設工作，它們是應該提早完成的。話劇旣是來商西洋，可是我們對西洋的演戲的了解，即使是現代戲劇，仍是一知半解，茫無頭緒。我們再不能因循，躭誤下去了，必得鼓勵能翻譯的人們從速有計劃地，介紹西洋的名劇，從知名的到不知名的，從近代的到古代的，一個個作家，一個個民族，以及一個個的派別；同時要挑選其中代表作家，民族，或時代潮流的劇作，忠實地嚴謹地演出它，這樣使我國的演劇能在三五年內走完西洋話劇幾百年的路子。在這項工作的過程中，自然，寫劇，導演，演技，和舞台技術等的修養可以普遍地提高，並且深入地研究了。當然劇團可以設立訓練班，來養成演員，另外戲劇學校和戲劇研究會的成立也都可以造大量的優秀的技術人才。加上業餘演劇和職業演劇的藝術的競賽和互相的督促，它的影嚮也足以形成一種學術風氣。這些因素的滙合也許就能使中國的話劇納上一條新演劇運動的軌道，向前疾馳猛進！</p>
<p>中國的話劇該走怎樣的一條路呢？</p>
<p>在上文我已經多多少少說了一些鄙見，讀者似乎還不難在中間得到一點消息。但如果硬要我下一個總的結論，那末，我想也是很單純的，即是：</p>
<p>目前的世界演劇潮流是由「藝術劇場」達到「人民劇塲」；我國的演劇比較落後，所以必須一下子完成兩項工作。——這是原則。至於具體方針那就不外下列兩點：一·介紹世界名劇。二·創造中國演劇。</p>
<h3>介紹「還我故鄉」</h3>
<p>— 竹咸</p>
<p>中國電影製片廠出品　史東山編導</p>
<p>「還我故鄕」的故事是展開在華北的一個小城。古老的城樓，四合院型的住屋，逐漸引出了一羣忠厚樸實的人民。他們終於從敵僞「宣僞」的狡計下，覺醒過來，爆發出如火如茶的抗爭。</p>
<p>一開始介紹出了在敵僞佔領下的平陽城。　無人烟的大街，和森嚴的佈着工事的城門口猙獰的警衛兵，成了顯明的對照。於是陰毒的敵警衛隊隊長神尾發出了繁榮市面的指示。敵兵對百姓的態度突然改變得如此的義然可親了，一批一批的刧掠物施給城中的居民，忠厚的人民的臉上添了笑　。</p>
<p>僞縣長也在拼命的招致躱在鄕間的仕紳，在這裘出現了王相庭——當地的大財主，一個個性崛强的老人，他有大量的財產在城內，還有一個深明大義從事救亡工作的兒子王道元，父子之間對「返城」這件事起了意見上的衝突，老人終於不顧一切的回到城裏，接受了僞商會會長的位置。道元聽信友人的勸告：「要有意義的回城去」。</p>
<p>平陽城冷落久了的大街上，現出了繁榮的景象，街上熙攘着的人羣在太陽啤酒·烟館·賭塲的招幟底下來往，還有就是充沛敵貨的商店。在這個光彩的表皮下發生了多少可悲的故事：浪人强「收買」商店；父親干涉在烟館襄不成材的兒子，被送入牢獄，還有重重繁複的奇奇怪怪的捐稅……</p>
<p>王相庭代表商界向神尾交涉，反而討了一塲沒趣。在法律只保障日人的情形下，小商人陳某去世了，一聲聲孤兒寡婦的嗚咽，打擊着這個老年人的崛强的心弦。</p>
<p>午夜，城外遠處傳來的槍落，暗示給從夢中驚醒的苦難的人們一條出路，大家孕育着一句不敢出口的話。王相庭也深深地懺悔了，要道元通知城外的國軍。</p>
<p>城裏出現了城外混進來的聯絡人員，敵人在大搜全城，，可是唐經綸——城外派來負責連絡的工作者終於得到廣大的人民以及並沒有忘去祖國的僞警的救助，沒有落到敵人的手裏。由此城裏展開了大規模的地下活動，人民組織起來，秘密地學習使用倫運進來的槍枝武器，還有獻金運動。使者矯裝了小販，負着夾帶着鈔票的布匹，以及人民對祖國的向往與希望，再出城去，城裏的人民都在靜聽着他那漸遠漸細的俘鼓聲。</p>
<p>劇塲內的燈光突然的亮了，我如同從夢中驚起，是的，我又重溫了一遍這八年來的噩夢，心好沉重呀！現在可過去了！</p>
<p>整部片子裏，沒有轟動的大塲面，沒有誇大的刺激，沒有任何渦份的渲染，然而却是深邃地把握住了人物內心的轉變，表現了人民力量的成長，看來如同一首抒情的小詩·史東山的手法籲總與常，聲音光綫都極好。演員中倒是錢千里最成功，刻劃出一個純樸可愛的老農，張眞，宗由盡責，陶金的王相庭却覺精力過旺些。</p>
<h3>歐陽紅櫻在重慶</h3>
<p>— 梅幼雲</p>
<p>—參加新中國居社演出　上海灘之夜潮—</p>
<p>「我在演戲，我也在體騐人生！你使我嘗盡了各色各樣的甜酸苦辣的滋味，你使我經歷了各種階層的人底心情！」</p>
<p>歐陽紅櫻爲參加上海灘之夜潮寫出了這樣的句子。這十年前上海劇壇的紅星便是這樣的在不斷地爲戲劇而努力，在求豐富她的人生。</p>
<p>上海灘之夜潮是叙述一個在上海很有地位的馮况麟家庭的故事，他是一個正直愛國的老者，他的二兒震雄和三女淑國也是愛國的靑年，却不幸他的大兒少棠和大媳黃似鶯却是一對貪生怕死唯利是圖的傢伙，少棠利用他父親的地位在日人手下當着憲兵隊特務處處長和米煤棉紗統制局局長的職務，是個魚肉人民，殘殺同胞，無惡不作的漢奸。助紂爲虐的還有少棠的表舅魏慶軒。馮家用的魏媽有一個瘋兒大寶，是一個白痴，却又知道愛國。震雄由內地回來不久因爲暗助愛國份子炸毀敵僞米棧竟被少棠拘押。况麟因此氣死。不久，少棠失勢，夫婦均被日人殺害，他的表舅却又繼他的職位奉日人的命令來查封他的財產，這時，勝利消息傳來，慶軒正擬搖身一變聲稱反正的時候，却莫明其妙地會被瘋子大寶率衆殺死。</p>
<p>紅櫻飾黃似鶯，是個很吃重的角色，但她却演得很好。飾少棠的韓　，飾况麟的宗山，飾表舅的夏天，飾淑國的黃苑蘇的演出，都爲這劇本生色不少。謝添寫這個劇本針對着那些想認爲漢奸有功於國的人的錯誤，意義是很正確的。不過有許多生硬牽强之處，尤其是他穿插上這個瘋子大寶的角色，同時又給他安上一個破壞全劇光彩的大寶率衆殺奸的尾巴，不能不認爲是這個劇本的大缺點！大寶和梅大夫的那個塲面更無意義！然而在一個初次學寫劇本的人能有這樣的成績，祗要他能不斷學習的話，他是有着他光明的前途的！</p>
<p>上海灘之夜潮能够轟動山城，博得不少的好評，大半還是因爲導演沈胖子的努力，和演員陣容齊整。紅櫻的賣力也是一個大原因！　十二，十三，於重慶</p>

<p>故都劇訊</p>
<h3>主席在平觀舊劇</h3>
<p>— 李木</p>
<p>戲劇界在勝利以後，比其它各界的情形似乎都使人滿意。話劇的好劇本在敵偽下不能演的，現在可以演出了。皮黃舊戲也掃除了以往的戲迷傳紡棉花等下流風氣，漸漸走上正規。在上海有退隱八年不爲敵僞利用的梅蘭芳博士，首先難　登臺演唱崑曲，慶祝勝利，並演營業戲十天票價雖高，而塲塲滿座，預料他不久將恢復演唱皮黃佳劇。</p>
<p>北平是舊劇的發祥地，然而幾年來在敵僞蹂躪下，戲風大壞。某女伶勝利後因受社會正直人士的指責，而圖謀自殺，不值識者一笑。四大名且之一的程硯秋也因受不慣漢奸們的淫威凌辱，隱爲老農，女伶之王的孟小冬更是一向決不登臺的。</p>
<p>蔣主席日前到北平，曾在懷仁堂招各名伶演唱佳劇，共娛外賓，是晚有程硯秋，孟小冬，李世芳，譚當英，馬連良等名伶皆登臺，盛况爲多年來所僅見。筆者頃接小名旦李世芳來函叙述頗詳，茲錄其中一節云：「……我現應戰地服務團之約，每四日表演一次慰勞美軍戲，劇目是貞娥刺虎，現已演過八塲，以後還要繼續下去。上星期二北平長官招待英首相代表魏亞特將軍與英駐華大使夫人，約我在銀行公會表演刺虎。昨晚我原有營業戲首次演唱天國女兒，因　蔣主席蒞平在懷仁堂演戲歡迎，因此我的營業戲暫停，歡迎戲目計（一）譚富英的失街亭，（二）孟小冬與李世芳的武家坡，（三）程硯秋的紅拂傳，（四）馬迎良李萬春的八大錘。當時盛况空前。主席與夫人同時到塲，尚有許多長官與盟軍數百人。演究武家坡我與孟小冬去見　主席，他非常慈祥，並站起來握手言謝　，還向盟軍長官給我們介紹，所以昨晚我雖院方回敝而得如此光榮收獲，覺得更爲高興……』由此函得知梅博士的得意弟子李世芳在平，亦忙於「刺虎」以慰美軍，師徒二人堪稱南北交輝，也是目下舊劇界一段佳話。</p>
<h3>「沙鷗」</h3>
<p>— 李青來</p>
<p>女作家施濟美和兪昭明傅筱峰等新近組織了一個完全業餘性的「沙鷗」劇團，已得市黨部和社會局的備案，近日正在趕排陳銓所編的「野玫瑰」，預備新年演出，導演爲馮喆，演員有張敏玉李靑來等，聞李係由重慶歸來曾在渝演過「蛻變」「虎符」「復活」獲得大量觀衆的好評，這次和張分AB制担任「野玫瑰」中的夏　華一角。</p>
<h3>「捐」與「娛樂」</h3>
<p>— 江上鷗</p>
<p>在重慶，爲了適應戰時需要，對娛樂場所的票價，加徵百分之五十娛樂捐外，尚有種種慈善義舉，另增附捐百分之數十不等，總之，一張電影票除了本身價值外，尚需百分之百各種捐稅。現在這作風吹到收復區來了，最近南京各娛樂塲所，正奉到市政當局加徵百分之四十娛樂捐外，接連來的要續徵百分之四十的冬賑捐（此捐之有利收復區貧民，常無疑義也），姑妄遐想一下，待機而來的「春賑」「夏賑」不難接踵而來。落筆無題之餘，該說這是爲了適應復員的需要吧。</p>
<p>據說此種「冬賬捐」自即日開徵，將績徵至明年三月問——那時芷是春暖花開的節季了！至少在末期徵收的捐款，那些需要「冬賑」的貧民是無資格受賑的了，因爲那時候已經到了春天，那豈不要應騐了前述的「春賑」之需。</p>
<p>冬天襄的窮苦老百姓應該受賑，但必須及早發賑，則苦百姓受惠匪淺；如果要挨次得到了「捐」來的錢發放，那便成了「拖」的狀態的　脆些，這些應時令的「捐」，應該有計劃有預算，與其　派在每一個想得到「精神食糧（且不謂之「尋求娛樂」）的人的身上，毋如由各娛樂塲所的老　或者是戲劇掮客影片經紀人作合理的負擔。</p>
<p>提起「娛樂捐」的命名問題，也曾經有過一段鬥爭史，即在後方成都，市政當局厘定「行爲取締稅」，看電影聽京戲俱屬於「行爲取締」之例，理應納稅，而其含義，與逛窰子吸雅片等等的不良行爲之需要取締，同出一貫。於是一陣風起，輿論羣相質問，經過了有關方面的交涉，始正名爲「娛樂捐」，「娛樂捐」之風波不小也。</p>
<p>你想尋求娛樂嗎？請照章納「捐」，「捐」與「娛樂」，難分難解，想獲得娛樂而「樂捐」一番，當然是「應盡的義務」也。</p>
<h3>越看越難看之下　越劇末落了</h3>
<p>— 愚翁</p>
<p>近五年來，我看過各地地方戲，不下廿種，覺得越劇（不是的篤班化名的女子越劇）嚴格的班規最，拿劇中包拯來說，各地方戲中都用凈角扮，越劇却歸老生應工的，包大人是正直無私的人物，剛而不粗，豪而具細，以性情而論，老生扮是比凈角扮合理。趙匡胤的戲，在越劇中倒由老生主演，可是一齣「高平關」就要派凈角浪了，因爲「高平關」中的趙匡胤是存心不良，帶有奸詐在內，不能用老生來扮他，可見越劇班規是比任何地方戲嚴檢，記得十餘年前，閘北大戲院開演越劇，該院當局爲越人，特請同鄕領袖王曉籟先生題額，王先生即寫了「越看越好」四個字，這四個字可以作紹興人看紹興戲，覺得紹興戲好解，同時更可以把「越」字作「愈」字解，那末便成愈看愈好了，的確，越劇的組織不比上海的由曲，漢口的楚劇，河南的大梆，唐山的蹦蹦等等簡陋，就是置於漢班徽調，川劇，塡戲之間也幷不遜色，「蓆棚會」（即硃痕記），「寶蓮燈」，「散潼關」（即斬經堂）等劇。都比平劇出色，不過越劇要多看，多看就看出好來，道大概就是王曉籟先生所謂「越看越好」吧！</p>
<p>可惜嚇！越劇在今日，及被掛越劇牌子唱嵊縣曲子的改良的篤班蓋罩，大有一蹶不起之勢，因爲越人中肯一擲千萬去辦改良的篤班（就是女子越劇），不願出百萬來組亂彈班（即越劇），一個買色，一個賣藝，自然色容易動人的，越劇在一般越人眼光中成了「越看越難看」，它的末落是難怪了。</p>

<p>在近代美國作家中，我們應該知道約翰史汀培克這個人。他的名作『怒火之花』提出了一個美國社會上的嚴重問題，說別人所不敢說的，而文筆警關而透切，沒有一般自命普羅作家的扭揑之態。『怒火之花』和他另一部名作「人獸關頭」曾於一九四一年先後搬上銀幕，博得好評。</p>
<p>另一部『日落』SunDdown）是反納粹小說，也由聯美攝成電影，主角是琪恩泰妮，喬治山德斯和「名城尤物」裏的勃魯斯卡博，這張影片在國際間的批評極好，內地也早映過。</p>

<h3>Government's Preconditions for Ceasefire: Communist Troops Must Withdraw from Railway Lines; Restore Traffic to Allow Refugees to Return Home</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] San Francisco, 29th Broadcast: The Chinese Nationalist and Communist parties did not continue negotiations today. This is because the Central Government has not yet been able to respond to the Communist Party's request for a ceasefire. It is reported that the Central Government will demand that the Communist Party withdraw from the railway lines before a ceasefire, with police maintaining order to restore traffic.</p>
<p>[United Press Chongqing, 29th Dispatch] The scheduled second meeting between the Nationalist and Communist parties did not take place today. It was learned from authoritative sources that the meeting did not take place because the National Government authorities had not yet responded to the Communist Party's demand to end the civil war. The official explanation was that Foreign Minister Wang Shijie's cocktail party for Special Envoy Marshall was also being held at the same time, so there was no time for a meeting. According to authoritative sources, the National Government can generally accept the Communist military's ceasefire request, but with an important condition: the Communist military must withdraw from the areas they occupy along the railways. The National Government believes this is necessary to restore traffic so that refugees can continuously return home. The National Government also agreed to send railway police to maintain order in the railway areas in place of the military. More optimistic political figures said that all important issues can be discussed and resolved in Nationalist-Communist negotiations, and the Political Consultative Conference will only become a formal stepping stone.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Chongqing, 29th Dispatch] As the old year is about to end, whether China's future will be one of peaceful unification or a full-scale civil war remains uncertain. However, hopes here are quite strong. U.S. Special Envoy to China Marshall has been here for eight days and has expressed extreme optimism, believing that the Nationalists and Communists are currently continuing to make unprecedented concessions. However, pessimists believe that the future Political Consultative Conference, which will discuss the outstanding issues between the Nationalists and Communists in an attempt to resolve them once and for all, may not achieve anything. All political figures who have spoken with Marshall have formed the impression that he is more familiar with the background of today's various problems than he admits.</p>
<p>Government Suggested Ceasefire Earlier; Communist Party Now Realizes Its Military Strength is Insufficient to Incite Rebellion; Suddenly Changes Attitude to Buy Time</p>
<p>[Reuters Chongqing, 29th Dispatch] When the Nationalists and Communists resume negotiations today, Chairman Chiang's response to the Communist Party's three-point ceasefire proposal is expected to be presented. At the same time, a government spokesperson (not a representative in the Nationalist-Communist negotiations) has refuted the Communist Party's proposal. According to the spokesperson, the National Government had already made such proposals on October 21st. The Communist Party now knows that its military strength is insufficient to defeat our side, so it has to suddenly change its attitude. The urgent problems that the whole country and the National Government are eager to solve now are the restoration of transportation lines, the disarmament of Japanese troops, and the repatriation of Japanese soldiers and civilians. The government suggested six weeks ago that the Communist forces withdraw six miles from the railway, and the railway lines would be guarded by the police. The government intends to notify the Communist Party in advance when it intends to transport troops along the railway lines. It is expected that the government will still insist on these two principles during this negotiation. According to reliable sources, Zhou Enlai discussed the Political Consultative Conference and the two major issues of Northeast China, etc., during a two-hour meeting with Special Envoy Marshall on Thursday.</p>
<p>[U.S. Information Service Chongqing, 28th Dispatch] New York Herald Tribune reporter Steele said today that Chairman Chiang is considering the formal written ceasefire proposal of the Chinese Communist Party. A Communist Party spokesperson told reporters that the document was presented last night during a two-hour meeting between representatives of the Nationalist and Communist parties. The Communist Party refused to release the original text of their written proposal last night, only saying that the government had agreed to forward the proposal to Chairman Chiang, and that a second meeting would be convened on Saturday or Sunday for further review and consideration of the various issues under consideration. The content of last night's meeting has not yet been revealed, and the government is keeping silent about the proposals made by its representatives. Although the government, like the Communist Party, has expressed an eagerness for the war to stop immediately, it insists on restoring railway traffic and the Communist military withdrawing from railway sections under their control or threat to a certain distance. The government is most concerned about being able to transport troops and supplies along the North China Railway without obstruction. The success or failure of the recent ceasefire negotiations may depend on the extent to which the Communist Party is willing to compromise on the railway traffic issue. The Communist Party said that their proposal is unconditional, but the public will make its own judgment after the full text of the proposal is published. Last night's meeting was the first formal meeting between Nationalist and Communist representatives since the Communist representatives returned here from Yan'an two weeks ago. This is one of several meetings to clear obstacles for the Political Consultative Conference. It is believed that the discussion of convening the Political Consultative Conference was also on the agenda last night. The government representatives were Zhang Qun and Shao Lizi, Secretary-General of the National Political Council, and the Communist representatives were Zhou Enlai, Ye Jianying, and Wang Ruofei, etc. U.S. Special Envoy Marshall invited Communist representative Zhou Enlai to lunch yesterday to listen to the details of the political situation in China, and then attended the welcome banquet of U.S. Chargé d'Affaires Robertson, where Marshall met with representatives of the Kuomintang, the Communist Party, the Democratic League, and non-partisan figures.</p>
<h3>Post and Telecommunications and Train Fares in North China: New Prices Temporarily Postponed</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Beiping, 29th Dispatch] Premier Song's visit to Beiping places great emphasis on stabilizing prices. It has recently been decided that the implementation of new prices for post and telecommunications and train fares in North China on New Year's Day will be temporarily postponed.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Beiping, 29th Dispatch] The ever-increasing cost of living is the greatest source of suffering for the people of North China today. Although prices once fell, they rebounded in October. Salaried workers are particularly affected, and even former university professors are pulling rickshaws. Their monthly salary of 20,000 yuan in puppet regime currency is only worth four U.S. dollars. Civil servants here are divided into two types, one sent from Chongqing and the other locally recruited, with different treatments, which is also a cause of unrest. The Kuomintang's Beiping Chronicle recommends increasing the salaries of local employees based on the cost of living index. The unemployment problem cannot be solved due to the Nationalist-Communist issue. It is estimated that there are 100,000 unemployed people in Beiping alone. The government has started unemployment registration in Beiping, but there is no direct relief measure yet. The Chronicle urges Premier Song to pay attention to one point, roughly saying: "If these people are unemployed for a long time, they may be conscripted by the Chinese Communists. The government should not hold their past against them and allow them to start anew."</p>

It is said that the Youth Party has not yet submitted any documents.

After this location is decided, the United Nations plans to purchase real estate with millions of dollars to build a huge building, making it a true international center unaffected by Americanization.</p>
<p>[Associated Press London, 28th Dispatch] A spokesman for the United Nations Temporary Committee announced today that one of the two urban areas of Boston or New York will be chosen as the permanent headquarters of the United Nations organization. The subcommittee will travel to the United States on the 3rd of next month to inspect suitable headquarters. At least fifteen locations will need to be inspected.</p>
<h3>UNRRA Aid to China: Reconsidering Allocation Amounts; Results Expected to be Announced in Ten Days</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Washington, 28th Dispatch] The China Branch Office of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) in the United States stated that UNRRA has announced a $675 million relief plan for China and hopes to increase the relief amount again soon. China is not satisfied with the current plan because the decision on its allocation was not on an equal footing with other recipient countries, nor did it take into account the large number of people in need of relief. The UNRRA Design Subcommittee is currently reconsidering China's allocation amount, and the results may be announced in ten days. China has requested $945 million from UNRRA, believing it to be very fair. Compared to the $272.7 million in foreign exchange relief that China is promoting itself, it is only a small part. This relief is expected to be implemented in one or two years. In addition, there is a parallel relief effort of 30 trillion legal currency, so it cannot be said that China is not making efforts to save itself.</p>

<h3>Negotiations Underway for Taking Over Shenyang; National Army Enters Rehe in Multiple Routes</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 29th] Zhang Jia'ao telegraphed from Shenyang on the 28th to Director Du, stating: The Soviet Commander in Shenyang requested that Director Du send senior officials to Shenyang to negotiate the takeover by the National Army. Du has dispatched several officials, scheduled to depart for Shenyang on the morning of the 30th for negotiations. In recent days, our army's takeover work in northern Jinzhou has been proceeding smoothly. On the afternoon of the 28th, various units were stationed separately in Yixian, 55 kilometers from Jinzhou, and Qinghemen, 120 kilometers from Jinxian. The magistrate of Yixian has entered the county town with the army. Due to the rapid advance of the National Army, the damage to Yixian city is minimal. Workers have been dispatched to repair the bridges along the Jin-Yi Railway, which were destroyed by the Communist army. The railway is expected to be open to traffic within days. According to reliable sources, the National Army has crossed the Liaoning-Rehe border and entered Rehe in multiple routes, starting on the morning of the 29th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 29th, United Press] General Du Yuming told a United Press reporter in Jinzhou that the officials he had dispatched were maintaining contact with the Soviet side to prepare for the entry of the National Army into Shenyang.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 29th] The National Army is currently advancing in three routes in the Northeast, and progress is reported to be smooth. Only the route attacking Rehe Province is encountering resistance. It is reported that the National Army on the eastern route has entered Xinmin. According to news received in Chongqing, the city has fallen into the hands of the National Army. On the southern route, it is reported that the National Army has entered Yingkou. It is reported that General Du Yuming is paying the most attention to the fighting on the western route in Rehe Province, and that he is personally directing the attack on Chaoyang and Beipiao. These western cities, located 45 kilometers north and northwest of Jinzhou, are the two main targets of General Du Yuming's offensive in Rehe. The Yan'an Communist radio station called the deep penetration of Rehe by General Du Yuming's forces a "large-scale offensive."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 29th] The Jinzhou branch of the Central Bank opened on the morning of the 29th. The circulation certificates began to be used today. The legal tender stamped by Director Du's headquarters is used at the same value as the circulation certificates.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper Report] A broadcast from San Francisco on the 29th stated: Jiang Jingguo has resigned from his position as Special Envoy for Northeast Diplomacy. This trip to the Soviet Union is as the Chairman's representative to negotiate with the Soviet side.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency Reporter Liu Zhuzhou, Shenyang, 27th] On the evening of my arrival, I had a long conversation with Soviet City Defense Commander Major General Gavrilov, officers Zhatov, and Grigorov. Hege spoke fluent Chinese and could write neat Chinese characters. They are very fond of Chinese literature, especially translations of ancient literature. The first Russian translation of Dream of the Red Chamber was by Ge. Major General Gavrilov is a generous drinker and talker, and told the reporter many stories about his contact with people from all walks of life since arriving in Shenyang. He said that he had met with three imposters each for the positions of governor, mayor, and police chief, but only today did he meet with the real representatives of the Central Government. He very much hopes that the National Army will arrive soon and that the Central News Agency will send a reporter to be stationed permanently in Shenyang. I told him that my companion, currently in Jinzhou, could come here, and asked if there were any trains from here to Jinzhou. He said that he was only responsible for the Shenyang area and did not know about anything else. Gao was originally an engineer. He pays close attention to public utilities and is very concerned about the lives of the citizens, and he is particularly willing to do his best to promote Sino-Soviet friendship. He acknowledged that in the past, many conspirators had used the Soviet army as a shield to seize political power, but he never regarded them as his targets. The Soviet officers and soldiers I contacted here are all enthusiastic and lively and have a deep understanding of China's situation. They all strongly believe that the permanent friendship between China and the Soviet Union is a factor for permanent world peace. The reporter asked Commander Gavrilov what he wanted to say to the Chinese people. He said: Only one sentence, that is, the thorough and unreserved friendly coexistence between China and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Harbin, 28th] The Mayor of Harbin, Yang Chuo'an, and a group of 27 people from the Ministry of Finance responsible for financial and monetary takeover, accompanied by Yang Zuoren of the military delegation and Andreyev, Liaison Officer of the Changchun Soviet Garrison Headquarters, traveled by car from Changchun at 2:20 PM on the 26th and arrived at 10:00 PM.

<h3>Meeting of Three Foreign Ministers Breaks the Impasse; Meeting of Five Powers to be Held Next Month; Great Improvement in US-UK-Soviet Relations</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 29th] The New York Times reported today that the five powers, China, the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France, may hold their first meeting in London next month to discuss various plans to determine the necessary international forces to maintain peace. The various plans are currently being discussed through diplomatic channels. The British government is in a leading position, but it is not yet known whether other major powers such as China, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France will accept. An early meeting of the five powers is of great significance. Currently, all countries have permanent post-war military equipment, and the biggest consideration of the meeting will be the question of the number of land, sea, and air forces. The five major countries will all be asked to contribute to the military equipment of the United Nations organization.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 29th] Diplomatic circles here hope that a meeting of military representatives of the five powers will be held in January to discuss the establishment of an international peace security force in accordance with the provisions of the United Nations Charter. The British Foreign Office neither denies nor confirms the convening of this meeting. However, authoritative sources speculate that after the United Nations General Assembly convenes on January 10 and forms the Security Council, the Military Committee will meet as soon as possible.</p>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 29th] After the end of the meeting of the three foreign ministers, various steps have been taken to implement the agreement. According to well-informed sources, the following developments will take place within 48 hours after the end of the meeting: (1) Representatives of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union will depart for Bucharest to implement the agreement on Romania. (2) The Soviet government will notify Bulgaria to request the reorganization of the cabinet. (3) An order will be issued to the US and Soviet military commanders in Korea to establish a joint committee to comply with the resolutions of the three parties. (4) The United Nations organization will be notified with official documents regarding the atomic agreement.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 28th Special Dispatch] Since the meeting of the five foreign ministers in October fell into a stalemate, the general mood has been quite pessimistic for three months. However, after the official announcement of the great achievements made by the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union at the Moscow meeting at 3:00 AM this morning, the belief that international cooperation can be achieved in the future has been strengthened. General commentary, with a few exceptions, is optimistic. Most observers regard this meeting as an "amazing achievement" and a "new development of peace." Since the Potsdam Declaration, the entire United Kingdom has not expressed such joy for any official announcement as it has for this Moscow communiqué. Generally wise observers acknowledge that the Soviet side and the British and American sides at the meeting demonstrated significant mutual concessions and coordination, but some critics emphasize that the British and American concessions to the Soviet Union were greater.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Reporter Tang Dechen, New York, 27th] The initial reaction of the United States, both the government and the public, to the Moscow communiqué can be described as "cautious optimism." Most believe that the Moscow agreement will have a far-reaching impact on the general atmosphere of cooperation between the three countries, especially between the United States and the Soviet Union. However, American commentators quickly pointed out the difficulties that often arise in implementing agreements after previous meetings, and that another meeting must be held in the end. The results of this meeting are considered satisfactory. (1) The three foreign ministers have broken the deadlock in the London Foreign Ministers' Conference. (2) The Foreign Ministers' Conference will be convened again. (3) The 21 countries that previously participated in the European war will discuss the European peace treaty issue, regardless of whether the meeting is under the control of the three countries. (4) Progress has been made in resolving the stumbling blocks between the three countries, especially between the United States and the Soviet Union, on the control of Japanese atomic bombs and the occupation of Korea and the China issue. Realists observe that the outcome of this meeting is considered a victory for the Soviet Union, as the Soviet Union has always insisted that the future post-war settlement plan, even if not entirely decided by the three countries, should also give the three countries special privileges. However, on the other hand, these realists comforted themselves that the British and American concessions to the Soviet Union had been compensated for, that is, the Soviet Union's enhanced cooperation with the United Nations organization and the resolution of global issues should be done in a multifaceted way. It is believed that mutual suspicion between the United States and the Soviet Union will be eliminated as a result. In summary, Americans believe that the Moscow agreement is a major step forward, but hope that this time, the problem of interpretation of terms arising from the implementation of the agreement will not occur again as it did before.</p>
<h3>Keeping Atomic Bomb Secrets; The United States Has Not Changed Its Original Intention</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 29th] President Truman will support a gradual disclosure of atomic energy secrets, more cautiously than the initial impression indicated by the Moscow Three-Nation Communiqué. The President, who had just returned from a Christmas holiday reunion with his family in Missouri, had spoken with those who interpreted the plan to establish an international atomic energy management committee in this way. It is said that Truman advocates that the United States should always know that small secrets are not misused before more important secrets can be revealed. Conversations within the President's Office and the State Department indicate that US policy will first test the proposed inspection methods, and then inform any country of all secrets regarding the atomic bomb, except for Britain and Canada. Republican Senator Vandenberg stated that the State Department had told him that the international committee dealing with atomic energy issues required full security. Vandenberg, a member of the Senate Atomic Energy Special Committee, advocated retaining this secret until it is proven that international management can prevent it from being used for military applications. The Moscow Three-Nation Conference Communiqué proposed four points for the proposed committee, which will be established by the United Nations organization and be responsible to the World Security Council. Its four points are as follows: (1) Exchange of basic scientific information between countries; (2) Management of atomic energy to ensure its use for peaceful purposes; (3) Elimination of atomic bombs and other bombs that can cause massive destruction; (4) Establish effective guarantees through inspection and other methods to protect complying countries, prevent risks, sabotage and circumvention. Vandenberg said that the reason he opposed the communiqué was that its original intention was not to make this goal implemented in the order of the four points proposed, but all should be read together, and each point should have the necessary full security, and all must be finally approved by Congress. His proposition will be generally accepted in Congress.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 28th] Before leaving Moscow, Byrnes expressed in a warning tone that the United States had not given up any of its secrets regarding the atomic bomb, but he did make it clear that the United States was willing to take the lead in obtaining peacetime applications of atomic energy.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 28th] Regarding the Moscow Conference's resolution on the atomic energy issue, Democratic Senator Vandenberg announced today after meeting with President Truman and Acting Secretary of State Acheson that, according to official opinion, every step in dealing with the atomic energy issue will be premised on "complete security," and it is guaranteed that each stage will be finally approved by Congress.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 28th] The members of the Senate Atomic Energy and Foreign Affairs Committees all stated that they wanted to know more details about the agreement established at the Moscow Three-Nation Foreign Ministers' Conference. Republican Senator Austin told reporters that there was a "very strong feeling" in the Atomic Energy Committee that it must proceed slowly, that is, no detailed information on the application of atomic energy to industry could be disclosed or exchanged until effective control methods were found to ensure that atomic energy would no longer be used for destruction. The application of atomic energy in industry accounts for three-quarters of the atomic bomb manufacturing process.</p>
<h3>Measures Against Japan; MacArthur Did Not Criticize</h3>
<p>[Central Press Agency, Tokyo, 29th Special Dispatch] MacArthur has not yet made any detailed comments on the Moscow resolution to set up an Allied Commission for Japan in Tokyo and a Far East Commission in Washington to exclusively control Japan. The MacArthur Headquarters Liaison Bureau's unofficial report yesterday afternoon stated that MacArthur had been notified in advance of the Moscow resolutions. However, the reporter's observation of the headquarters situation showed that people were surprised by the communiqué of the Three-Nation Foreign Ministers' Conference.</p>
<p>Japan Panicked and Dispirited</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 28th] The various resolutions of the Moscow Three-Nation Foreign Ministers' Conference have been published. All sectors in Japan have expressed panic and dismay in discussing this matter. Most observers expressed fear about the creation of an international management agency for Japan. A certain Japanese newspaper stated: The Japanese like and trust General MacArthur, and are now afraid that some of his policies will be hindered by China and the Soviet Union. The Japanese have long been educated and cannot help but fear and suspect these two countries. In Tokyo, fears about the fate of Emperor Hirohito are also growing. All sectors in Japan recall that China and the Soviet Union had previously proposed plans to force the Japanese Emperor to abdicate.</p>
<p>Koreans Oppose Trusteeship System</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 28th] The American Korea Committee stated today that the three powers' plan to govern Korea for five years "is an evil scheme, in which there cannot be free existence." Committee Chairman Colonel Lin said: This plan "is contrary to the goals that the people of China, the United States, the Soviet Union, and Britain sacrificed their lives to fight for in this war. These people sacrificed their lives for freedom, but the trusteeship system is not freedom, but supervision and rule."</p>
<h3>Bulgarian Foreign Minister Announces; Acceptance of Soviet Proposal</h3>
<p>[United Press, Sofia, 29th] Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanov announced to the National Assembly today that the Bulgarian government accepted the Soviet proposal to expand the government organization to accommodate representatives of all parties to participate, and that it would faithfully implement the resolutions of the three foreign ministers.</p>
<h3>Spokesperson of Our Government; Talking About the Three-Nation Conference; Fully Agreed on Deciding Japan's Fate; Trusteeship of Korea Will Actually Help Independence</h3>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 29th] The spokesperson of the Chinese government said this afternoon: China fully agrees with the Moscow communiqué's proposal to establish an advisory committee in Washington and a four-power committee in Tokyo to decide the fate of Japan after the war. The spokesperson said that the various proposals accepted by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs have been concretely summarized in the Moscow communiqué concerning the control of Japan. He continued: "We believe that close cooperation between the Allied powers is necessary in this matter. The Moscow communiqué will be a test of cooperation between the Allied powers." The spokesperson said: "China has always hoped that Korea will become a free and independent country. We believe that a fixed period of trusteeship can help Korea achieve independence."</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 28th] The Chinese in Chongqing welcomed the various agreements of the Three-Nation Foreign Ministers' Conference, especially those related to China, hoping to safeguard China's sovereignty in the Northeast provinces and strengthen China's hope for peaceful unification. Regarding the agreement on the early withdrawal of US and Soviet troops, the Chinese believe that the withdrawal of Soviet troops will inevitably be delayed, and the US troops will withdraw immediately after the Japanese troops surrender, disarm, and are sent back home. Regarding the Korean issue, Chinese officials believe that China has always advocated Korean independence, but does not agree to divide Korea into US and Soviet-controlled zones during the five-year trusteeship period.</p>
<h3>President Truman; Listens to Byrnes' Report</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 28th] Washington today generally believes that the Foreign Ministers' Conference agreement is another "milestone" for world peace. Washington officials and diplomatic circles are celebrating the breaking of the deadlock since the failure of the London Foreign Ministers' Conference. It is believed that the relations between the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union have greatly improved, and that the resolution of several major world problems currently anxious in Washington will make the hope for international cooperation brighter when the United Nations General Assembly is held on January 10 next year. President Truman returned to Washington from Missouri today. He will receive Byrnes' report, who is scheduled to arrive here tomorrow. President Truman will take the presidential yacht to Chesapeake Bay, 45 miles south of Washington, for five days tomorrow. Before Byrnes returns, the State Department refused to explain or clarify the many questions asked about the Allied Commission for Japan and the restrictions imposed on MacArthur. Truman's press liaison secretary Ross told the press today that the White House has not had enough time to obtain a national reaction, but so far has not received satisfactory criticism.</p>
<h3>Representatives of Five Countries Open; German Embassy and Consulate Archives</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Istanbul, 29th] The German archives of the former German Embassy in Turkey and consulates in various places will be opened by a committee jointly formed by Turkey, Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France.</p>
<h3>Tojo to Be Tried</h3>
<p>Intend to Ask Former Subordinates to Testify</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Tokyo, 29th Special Dispatch] It is reported that the Japanese government recently requested permission for the Japanese side to send three representatives from outside the province to China in order to deal with the issue of compensation for losses in the war against China, Britain, and the United States. This rumor has been denied here. In addition, the Japanese government requested the Allied forces to send three former Tojo secretaries back to Japan from China. They have been sent back to the Japanese government liaison office and must be submitted again at an appropriate time. The names of Tojo's three secretaries are as follows: (1) Akamatsu, (2) Nishio, (3) Hattori. It is said that the Japanese government intends to recall these three people in order to testify for Tojo. The Allied forces declared that this request was made by Tojo's lawyer and could be considered.</p>
<p>Abuse of Prisoners and Excessive Torture</p>
<p>[United Press, Yokohama, 29th] Yuri, the chief of the Japanese Omura Prisoner-of-War Camp, is being tried for killing British and American prisoners of war. The military court has ordered the prosecutor to send a telegram to the United States to obtain all sworn statements from important witnesses. Today, Sergeant Fied testified in court that the torture commonly used by Japanese guards was to apply a gelatinous substance to the prisoners' arms and then stick ignited wooden pieces to it. When the wooden pieces burned out, the gelatinous substance caught fire, causing unbearable pain. This torture was also applied to the neck, ears, and other parts, and even to the entire body.</p>
<h3>British Cabinet to Hear Bevin's Report Next Week; Bevin to Brief Attlee First; Next Meeting in Washington in March</h3>

Bevin is likely to visit Prime Minister Attlee's country residence to give the Prime Minister a direct and simple briefing on the meeting. The next meeting will be held in Washington in March next year. While there is general satisfaction with the global resolution of the international deadlock and the hope of reaching an era of world peace and security, British and American figures still criticize the initial reaction of U.S. government personnel on certain areas and details, such as the Korean issue, and seem quite disappointed that Korea did not immediately achieve complete independence. However, the U.S. representative in Moscow believes that the agreements reached with the Soviet Union on various matters indicate the greatest progress in U.S.-Soviet relations.</p>
<h3>U.S. Ambassador Harriman to Go to Romania</h3>

<h3>All-India Women Fight for Freedom</h3>

<h3>Britain Decides to Help the Netherlands Restore Order in the East Indies, Promotes Understanding in Indo-Dutch Negotiations; Anglo-Dutch Talks End, Communiqué Issued</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 29th, Reuters] The Anglo-Dutch talks on the Indonesian issue have now ended. A statement issued by the Prime Minister's Office at 10 Downing Street said that the British government reiterated its obligation to assist its Dutch ally in establishing security as soon as possible, so that the Dutch-Indonesian governments can continue negotiations with Indonesian representatives. The British and Dutch governments have discussed policies to promote understanding between Indonesian nationalist leaders and Dutch authorities. Other steps will also be taken immediately to ensure the safety of prisoners of war and detained expatriates in Indonesia.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 29th] Dutch Indies Vice-Governor Van Mook told a group of reporters yesterday: "After returning to Java, the solutions I intend to propose to the Indonesian leaders have been discussed in detail with the Dutch government and have been approved by them. I expect the Indonesian leaders to accept these suggestions. After carefully studying the matter with my country's authorities during my return, I have revised the suggestions I made to the Indonesian leaders in November." Although the details of the recent Dutch plan have not been obtained, it is believed that it proposes the establishment of a republic consisting of the entire East Indies archipelago, maintaining contact with the Netherlands, drafting a constitution for it, and giving the people of the East Indies full autonomy in handling their internal affairs. However, defense, diplomacy, and other important matters must still be handled jointly with the government in The Hague. The communiqué issued after the Anglo-Dutch talks indicates that the British side is deeply convinced that the Indonesian issue can be resolved through direct negotiations between Indonesian and Dutch leaders. However, British troops in Java will continue to perform guard duties to limit the activities of extremists and protect the safety of expatriates. Van Mook clarified the rumors that he had a dispute with the Dutch government, saying that the Dutch Indies government and the government in The Hague are far apart, and different views are sometimes inevitable, but there are no differences in the essential elements of policy.</p>
<h3>Mexico Advocates Racial Equality</h3>
<p>[United Press, Mexico City, 28th] The Mexican Lower House passed a resolution yesterday calling on the parliaments of all countries and United Nations agencies to abolish racial and color discrimination. After the bill is passed by the Upper House, it will be promulgated in the name of the Mexican Parliament. The resolution stated that the Nazi Party's claim of racial superiority led to World War II, so Mexico's international policy is based on the equality of all mankind and all races in the world. True global ethnic cooperation and true guarantees against future wars should not recognize any difference between Europeans, Asians, Indo-Americans, blacks, or Jews. Only when all mankind and all races are completely equal can peace develop humanity, culture, and civilization.</p>
<h3>Our Ambassador to the United States Meets with Acheson</h3>

<h3>Japanese Assets in the United States to Be Fully Confiscated</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 29th] All the assets of Japanese residents in the United States were frozen by the Treasury Department at the beginning of the war. Chairman Markham of the Foreign Property Custodian Committee ordered today that these assets be reported and announced that they would be confiscated as soon as the reports were received. According to Markham, this is part of the government's plan to eliminate Japan's economic power within the country. Reports on the assets of Japanese residents in Hawaii and the Philippines will be submitted to local branch offices of the Custodian Committee.</p>
<h3>Japanese Constitutional Experts Draft a Revised Draft Constitution, Transferring the Emperor's Ruling Power to Parliament; Whether Shidehara Agrees is Still in Question</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 28th] The revised draft of the Japanese Constitution has been submitted to the Japanese cabinet by constitutional experts. The draft contains various innovative changes, and all privileges of the Japanese imperial family will also be returned to the people. Tokyo newspapers have published the draft in a prominent position, as it is the first draft prepared to date. This revised draft was drafted by Japanese constitutional authorities Hozumi Suzuki and Professor Mitsujiro Sugino of Waseda University. It transfers ruling power from the hands of the Emperor to Parliament. The Emperor will only preside over national ceremonies and rituals, and Parliament will have the power to approve the Emperor's accession and appoint a regent. The current privileges of Emperor Showa will also be transferred to Parliament. The Speakers of both the House of Representatives and the House of Peers will also have the power to recommend a new Prime Minister. However, it seems unlikely that the above points will be included in the final revised constitution currently being drafted by the Shidehara Cabinet, as Shidehara and Foreign Minister Yoshida both insist that the Japanese Constitution does not need to be thoroughly revised and can be adapted to the current national conditions. Only the part that was previously abused needs to be revised. Both stated that the current constitution is already democratic. The Constitution Problem Investigation Committee of the Japanese Cabinet held its sixth meeting at the Prime Minister's official residence yesterday to discuss the provisional draft of the revised constitution. The committee will continue to hold meetings during the New Year.</p>
<h3>War Profits Tax Plan Also Drafted</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 29th] According to Japanese sources today, the Ministry of Finance has completed a war profits tax plan, which is expected to collect 100 billion Japanese yen. The plan is scheduled to be submitted to the Supreme Commander of the United Nations for approval on the 31st of this month. The Ministry of Finance drafted this plan because MacArthur issued instructions to collect a war profits tax of 10% to 100% and a property tax of 10% to 70%, so that the Japanese would know that there was no profit to be made from the war. In addition, there are two actions in response to MacArthur's instructions. It is expected that the Ministry of Health and Welfare will issue a special instruction today that the occupational wages and working conditions of workers will not be affected by national education or social status. Prefectural governors and other officials will regularly inspect civilian enterprises, and government departments will also be responsible for implementation. The Emperor will also issue an edict today stipulating that those who violate the order prohibiting various aviation training should be punished, with a maximum penalty of three years' imprisonment and a fine of 5,000 Japanese yen. The final details of the plan have not yet been announced, but it is said that individuals will be subject to war profits tax from 1940, and judicial personnel from 1937.</p>
<p>Old Shidehara Falls Ill</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 29th] Japanese Prime Minister Shidehara, aged 73, has been seriously ill for four days due to a severe cold. After being treated with penicillin by MacArthur's personal doctor, his condition has improved today.</p>
<p>Women's Political Party Appears</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 29th] Japan's first women's political party was officially established today, called the New Japan Women's Party, and has nominated several candidates to participate in future elections. The initiators include Tomita, the president of Tokyo Medical College, and other female leaders. However, the party's platform has not yet been published. This women's group and thirty other associations, although named political parties, are actually more like small political organizations with varying influence, but in Japan, such women's groups are still a novelty.</p>
<h3>New Drug Invented to Treat Epilepsy</h3>
<p>[United Press, Chicago, 28th] The Journal of the American Medical Association published a new drug for treating epilepsy, called Tridione. According to a report by Dr. Lennox, a professor of medicine at Harvard University, this drug is very effective in treating epilepsy. It was used to treat forty patients, 28% of whom were completely cured, 52% of whom had their seizures reduced by more than 75%, and the remaining 20% had some effect. This drug is the most effective method tried for treating epilepsy.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Melbourne, 29th] Lieutenant General Northcott, commander of the Empire's occupation forces in Japan, met with military representatives from Britain, India, and New Zealand in Melbourne today to discuss plans for the Empire's troops to occupy Japan next year.</p>
<h3>Full Text of the Communiqué of the Council of Foreign Ministers (Continued from Yesterday)</h3>
<p>Fifth: Regarding Romania</p>
<p>The governments of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union are prepared to offer advice to King Michael of Romania, advising the King to expand the Romanian government to include one member of the National Peasant Party and one member of the Liberal Party. The following committee</p>
<p>(1) must genuinely represent the groups or parties in opposition.</p>
<p>(2) must cooperate loyally with the government. The U.S., British, and Soviet governments, paying attention to the reorganized Romanian government, should announce free and unimpeded elections, in which all anti-fascist parties have the right to participate. The government should guarantee freedom of reporting, speech, religion, and assembly. Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Vyshinsky, U.S. Ambassador Harriman, and British Ambassador Kerr are authorized to form a committee to go to the capital of Romania to consult with King Michael and current government officials in order to implement the above-mentioned tasks. Once these tasks are completed and the necessary guarantees are obtained, the U.S. and British governments will recognize the Romanian government that maintains diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Sixth: Bulgaria</p>
<p>The three governments understand that the Soviet government is willing to take responsibility for contributing friendly advice to the Bulgarian government, namely that the current Fatherland Front government of Bulgaria should include representatives of other democratic groups. These representatives:</p>
<p>(A) genuinely represent the groups or parties in the opposition. Once the British and American governments are convinced that this friendly advice has indeed been accepted by the Bulgarian government and that the aforementioned representatives have indeed been included in the Bulgarian government, the British and American governments will recognize the Bulgarian government that already has diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Seventh: The United Nations Organizes an Atomic Energy Control Commission</p>
<p>Regarding the discussion of the atomic energy issue and the establishment of a committee by the United Nations General Assembly, the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union have agreed to recommend to the United Nations General Assembly that the United Nations organize a committee to consider the various issues arising from the discovery of atomic energy, as well as related matters, and have agreed to invite other permanent members of the Security Council (namely China and France) and Canada to jointly participate in initiating the following resolution at the first meeting of the United Nations General Assembly to be held in January next year: The United Nations General Assembly resolves to establish a committee to handle all issues arising from the discovery of atomic energy, as well as other related matters. The organization and qualifications of the committee are as follows.</p>
<p>(1) Establish a committee to be established by the General Assembly in accordance with the conditions of Article 5 below.</p>
<p>(2) The relationship between the committee and the United Nations agencies (A) The committee must submit its reports and recommendations to the Security Council. Such reports and recommendations must be made public unless the Council stipulates otherwise for the sake of peace and security. The Security Council shall forward these reports to the General Assembly and the member states of the United Nations, as well as to the Economic and Social Council within the Council itself.</p>
<p>(B) According to the United Nations Charter, the primary responsibility of the Security Council is to maintain international peace and security. Therefore, the Security Council should issue guidance on security issues to the committee. The committee shall consist of one representative from each representative state of the Security Council and Canada. Each representative on the committee may select the assistant he or she wishes to employ.</p>
<p>(3) Rules of procedure: The committee must employ the staff it deems necessary and must submit proposals for rules of procedure to the Security Council for approval.</p>
<p>(4) Terms of reference for the committee: The committee must continuously investigate all aspects of the issue and submit appropriate recommendations at any time, especially concrete recommendations.</p>
<p>(A) Expanding the international exchange of basic scientific intelligence for peaceful purposes.</p>
<p>(B) Controlling atomic energy to ensure that it is only used for peaceful purposes.</p>
<p>(C) Eliminating atomic weapons and other major weapons suitable for mass destruction.</p>
<p>(D) Effectively safeguarding signatory states from the harm of violating states through inspection and other methods.</p>
<p>The work of the committee should be carried out in stages. The successful completion of each stage will generate trust among the people of the world, and then the second stage will be carried out. The committee shall not infringe upon the responsibilities of any agency of the United Nations, but shall contribute recommendations to the agencies in order to complete their tasks under the provisions of the United Nations Charter.

<h3>Opinions of the U.S., Britain, and the Soviet Union on the Moscow Council of Foreign Ministers Meeting: Praised as a Major Step Forward for the World</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 28th] Newspapers in the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union today praised the achievements of the Moscow Council of Foreign Ministers meeting as a major step forward towards a truly peaceful world. The newspapers also unanimously called the atomic agreement the most important achievement. The issue of Japanese control received almost the same attention in Moscow and the United States, but was ignored in Britain. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov was the victor in the Japanese control measures, so the comments in Moscow were the most enthusiastic. The News reported that the agreements were a new step in the direction of United Nations cooperation, without which there would be no stable peace. The tone of the London newspapers was also roughly the same, in stark contrast to the depression that filled the pages after the failure of the Five-Power Council of Foreign Ministers meeting in London in the autumn. Only the Daily Telegraph issued a warning, saying that it should not be assumed that all difficulties have been resolved. The London meeting was obviously too bad, and if the frank and friendly spirit that created this meeting cannot be maintained, then the Moscow meeting will also be too satisfactory and unbelievable. The Times called the meeting a remarkable success. The Daily Mail believed that there were excellent signs showing that countries were gradually regaining mutual trust and willing to compromise. The Washington Evening Star said that the United States had made major concessions, especially in the occupation policy of Japan. Because of this step, the resolution of Japan's various difficulties will no longer follow U.S. policy, and MacArthur has become the agent of the Far Eastern Commission. It is only hoped that Secretary of State Byrnes has obtained favorable treaties in exchange for this major step. The newspaper also reflected the general opinion that the atomic agreement may be the most important achievement of the meeting, but its effect remains to be proven by facts. A Soviet Pravda editorial stated that the organization of the Far Eastern Commission was of great significance. The Four-Power Control Committee for Japan was also necessitated by the facts. The Control Committee should eliminate attempts by Japanese warlords to preserve part of their strength. The San Francisco Chronicle stated that the atomic agreement has made the era of fear or international vigilance and distrust a thing of the past, restoring people's psychology and allowing the work of reconstruction and peaceful transformation to be carried out in a realistic mood. Regarding this matter, a United Press analyst cabled from London that the emergence of the atomic bomb had caused international concerns to grow and anxiety to increase. The failure of the previous Five-Power Council of Foreign Ministers meeting was undoubtedly caused by this. The decision of the Moscow meeting to remove these doubts shows that the meeting has achieved great success, but there seem to be several subtle and important difficult issues that have been left unresolved. The Soviet Union's relations with Iran and Turkey are among them. These two issues are of global importance and are full of gunpowder.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 28th] The Howard newspaper chain today opposed the Moscow agreement with a clear stance. One of its editorials stated: "The United States has again made major concessions to the Soviet Union, and has gained nothing for itself." One of the chain's writers, Raymond, said: "Whether it is a compromise or a plan, the agreement on the four-power control of Japan is extremely confusing. MacArthur may still be able to do something, but if someone with a slightly weaker spirit is put in his place, his hands and feet will be bound by the legislative straitjacket created by Moscow." The New York Sun said: "The true test of the Moscow agreement will be seen in the future. It is still unknown whether Byrnes and Bevin have explained that the Soviet Union has made mutual concessions for security." A Washington Post said: "The results of the Moscow meeting have curbed the deterioration of U.S.-Soviet relations. What has been agreed upon is that the Soviet Union has a voice in the Japanese Control Committee and the Far Eastern Commission. This approach will never interfere with MacArthur's daily administrative work." The Chicago Daily News said: "One of the most hopeful points of the entire agreement is that both the United States and the Soviet Union have announced that they will withdraw their troops from China as soon as possible."</p>
<h3>Local Dispatches</h3>
<p>Kunshan</p>
<p>Supervisory Delegation of the Pacification Headquarters Dispatches Personnel for Supervision</p>
<p>In order to comprehensively expand the work of the Third Detachment of the Pacification Supervisory Corps of the Beijing-Shanghai Garrison, Detachment Commander Ye Wen recently selected and dispatched officers to be stationed in various counties for long-term supervision. They will widely set up complaint boxes to receive the public's grievances and other suggestions for improvement. On the afternoon of the 27th, a discussion meeting was held with the heads of various county agencies and local gentry to make careful decisions on the future direction of work.</p>
<p>Changshu</p>
<p>Promoting Winter Farming and Prohibiting Deforestation</p>
<p>The county government, considering that the countryside is devastated after the war, production is shrinking, and food for the people is worrisome, and that a large amount of timber is needed at the beginning of recovery, decided that if management is not strengthened, local people will become accustomed to short-term gains and will inevitably indiscriminately cut down forests, which will not only affect the promotion of afforestation, but also cause endless disasters in the countryside. Therefore, it has been decided to: (1) promote winter farming, and (2) strictly prohibit indiscriminate logging and implement measures to protect forest resources. On the 27th, all districts were notified to comply.</p>
<p>Suzhou</p>
<p>Thefts Frequently Heard Amidst Power Outages</p>
<p>The Suzhou Electric Plant has recently been unable to maintain a steady supply of electricity due to a shortage of coal. Daytime electricity has been completely cut off, and nighttime electricity is intermittent and unstable, and is being rationed by district every day. Citizens are complaining. On the night of the 27th, the electricity supply was almost completely cut off, with only the area around Guanqian West Central Market having a barely functioning supply. All other areas were in darkness. Therefore, incidents of theft and robbery have been occurring in Suzhou every day. On the night of the 27th, during the planned outage, the homes of Chen Yuanchang and two other families in Jiyou Lane in the city were robbed of significant losses. The police are investigating.</p>
<p>Liyang</p>
<p>Preparing to Organize a County Local Bank</p>
<p>Liyang is located in the center of the Beijing-Zhejiang National Highway and on the border of Zhejiang and Anhui provinces. Since the War of Resistance, it has been a military battleground. After repeated incursions by the enemy and puppet troops, the entire county was scorched. After the victory, it was again occupied by bandits. To promote construction and recovery, fellow villagers living abroad and local people, led by Mei Zi, have initiated preparations for organizing a county local bank, which can concentrate resources to assist the government in implementing everything.</p>
<p>Huzhou</p>
<p>Agreement Reached on House Rental Regulations</p>
<p>The business on Zhitong Second Road in Wuxing City was thriving, but the market has been sluggish since the incident. Now that the enemy has surrendered and the National Army has arrived in Huzhou, merchants and residents who had fled to avoid the war are returning to their hometowns one after another. The demand for housing exceeds the supply, causing frequent disputes over housing rentals and rents. After repeated negotiations between Zhuang Boying and other representatives of shops and residents on Zhitong Second Road and the person in charge of the Zhicheng Real Estate Company, an agreement has been reached. (1) For shop premises rented before the 26th year, the original rent will be increased by 50 times. (2) For shop premises rented from the 27th year to the date of victory, the original rent will be increased by 60 times. (3) For new shop premises and residential rents from September of this year, a reasonable increase will be made according to the market. (4) Residential rents will still be increased by 30 times based on the original rent before the war. These measures will be implemented from this month.</p>
<p>Nanchang</p>
<p>Branch Office Launches Relief Work</p>
<p>After the Jiangxi Branch of the China Relief and Rehabilitation Administration was established in Nanchang on November 16, it has successively sent 6,000 refugees back to their hometowns in various places within the first month (until the 16th of this month). In addition to setting up refugee stations in the two transportation hubs of Nanchang and Jiujiang, refugee stations have also been set up successively in Ji'an, Zhangshu, Linchuan, Ganzhou, Jiujiang, and other places, which not only facilitates refugees from Gan, but also benefits righteous people returning to their hometowns from Xiang, Yue, Min, Zhejiang, Yuan, E, and Beijing and Shanghai. In addition, it is also actively promoting rural urgent aid and free medical care. It is estimated that in the areas of northern Jiangxi that have been most severely affected, thatched houses have been built for homeless farmers, and clothing, bedding, and agricultural tools have been distributed, costing a total of 19,000,000 yuan in national currency. At present, there is not a single hospital in Gan that can be trusted. The branch office has actively subsidized various hospitals to provide free clinics as soon as possible, with a total of 2,000,000 yuan subsidized to Chinese and Western hospitals. The Jiujiang Women and Children's Hospital, which has received this subsidy, will provide free clinics on New Year's Day of the 35th year. In addition to the above three items, the branch office also plans to use work relief methods to restore the highways of Jiangxi and repair river channels, etc.</p>

<h3>As the National Territory Regains its Light and the National Army Advances: A Retrospective on the Fate of the Northeast, Unfolding the Current Undertaking of Reconstruction and Development. Part 1. Special Draft by the Newspaper's Research Department.</h3>
<p>Every Chinese compatriot is craning their necks, their eyes wide open, closely watching the completion of the Northeast takeover and the advancement of the National Army's airlift operations. "When will the National Army be able to enter Shenyang?" is a burning question that has naturally formed in the minds of every compatriot in the Northeast and across the country. At the same time, with their firm confidence, they have long confirmed that this is a certain fact that is about to be realized. Precisely because this matter is bound to be realized, their expectations are even more intense and profound.</p>
<p>We all understand that the Northeast is an inseparable and indispensable part of our country. From the Open Door policy through the Nine-Power Treaty to the Cairo Conference held in recent years, whether it is a declaration or an agreement, they all uniformly presuppose that the Northeast is a major territory of our country, and expect that the Northeast will be the base for our country's industrialization and modernization. Therefore, what we are concerned with now is not when we will complete the restoration of our homeland after eight years of war, but how to restore and transform this long-suffering homeland, so as to become a guarantee of future peace and happiness rather than a source of future turmoil.</p>
<p>Under this basic understanding and important belief, tracing the fate of the Northeast has a profound meaning. Due to the scarcity of materials at hand, I will tentatively use the Northeast Foreign History Materials of the Northeast Investigation Bureau of the Central Design Bureau as a model, and add my own humble opinions to make a brief overview.</p>
<p>Historical Traces</p>
<p>China's Northeast, also known historically as Manchuria, is located in the central part of eastern Asia, roughly between 120 and 135 degrees east longitude and 40 and 53 degrees north latitude. This area had relations with mainland China as early as the Zhou Dynasty, and continued through successive dynasties. However, the Manchu people and the Han people of China did not achieve complete spiritual integration until the Qing Dynasty entered the Pass, through geographical connection and economic interconnection. The so-called spiritual integration refers to the integration of bloodlines, culture, thought, and living habits.</p>
<p>It is estimated that 99% of the Manchus have been assimilated with the Han people, and most of them have entered the Pass with the Qing Dynasty and are scattered in the inland eighteen provinces, as well as Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, and other places. After three or four hundred years of integration, it is no longer possible to distinguish between Manchu and Han. According to statistics from the enemy, Japan, the current population of the Northeast is about 43 million. It is estimated that more than 90% of them are of Han descent, the rest are of mixed Han-Manchu descent, and the aforementioned small number of pure natives.</p>
<p>Before the September 18th Incident in 1931, China had never had any disputes with its neighbors Japan and the Soviet Union due to borders. The source of the disputes lies elsewhere.</p>
<p>Japan and Russia's Covetousness</p>
<p>In 1894, China and Japan lost harmony and started a war due to the internal turmoil in Korea. The war in 1895 ended with the defeat of our country. The Treaty of Shimonoseki forced China to cede the Liaodong Peninsula as part of Japan's compensation. Japan's ambition to invade the East Asian continent originated from this. At the same time, the Tsarist Russian Empire, which also had ambitious ambitions and always wanted to get involved, was also eyeing this part of Chinese territory. Long before the Sino-Japanese War, Russia had been eyeing China's Northeast and the Korean coast. When Japan advanced into Liaodong, Tsarist Russia could not stand idly by, so it united with Germany and France to intervene and force it to return.</p>
<p>The Sino-Russian Secret Agreement of 1896 was the price demanded by Russia for intervening in the return of Liaodong. According to this agreement, China allowed Russia to build a railway in the northern part of the three eastern provinces (i.e., the Chinese Eastern Railway), the two ends of which should be connected to its Siberian Railway (construction began in 1891 and was largely completed in 1901). Therefore, the construction of the railway gave Russia many special rights and interests, such as the land rights of the so-called zone, the right to protect the railway with military police, the right to municipal police, administrative and judicial rights, the right to exploit forests, and the right to lay electric wires near the railway, as well as tax exemptions, tax reductions, and educational rights.</p>
<p>In 1898, taking advantage of China's troubles, Tsarist Russia further demanded the construction of a branch line of the Chinese Eastern Railway, starting from Harbin in the north and ending in Dalian in the south, and demanded that Lushun and Dalian be leased territories. In 1900, taking advantage of the Boxer Rebellion in China, it sent troops to the Northeast. After the incident, it delayed the withdrawal of troops, finally leading to the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905. In this battle, Russia was defeated and concluded the Treaty of Portsmouth with Japan, transferring Lushun, Dalian, and the southern section of the Chinese Eastern Railway (i.e., the section from Changchun to Dalian) to Japan.</p>
<p>Four Secret Agreements</p>
<p>From 1907 to 1917, Russia and Japan concluded four secret agreements in ten years, secretly dividing the Northeast into the spheres of influence of the two countries, that is, South Manchuria belonging to Japan and North Manchuria belonging to Russia. During these ten years, Japan first annexed Korea, then participated in the European War and achieved successive victories, while Russia faced the crisis of political revolution internally and suffered defeat against Germany externally. In 1917, the imperial system was overthrown and the Communist Party came to power. At that time, the civil war between the Red and White armies in Siberia broke out, so various countries sent troops to intervene, and Japan also participated.</p>
<p>On July 25, 1919, in order to request China's recognition, the Soviet government issued a declaration abandoning all its rights and interests in China, including its rights and interests in the Northeast and the Chinese Eastern Railway. On October 27, 1920, the Soviet government issued another statement, stating the conditions for establishing relations with China. Originating from these two documents, the Sino-Soviet Agreement of May 31, 1924, and the temporary management measures for the Chinese Eastern Railway were concluded. Unfortunately, the two countries failed to revise the detailed treaty originally planned, and in 1926, Ivanov interfered with military transport. In 1929, there was a Soviet Communist conspiracy in Harbin, which finally led to an armed conflict between the two countries on the eastern and western borders that year. On December 22, China and the Soviet Union signed the Boli Protocol, and both sides ceased armed actions. According to the protocol, the two countries should hold a meeting in Moscow to discuss the issue of redeeming the Chinese Eastern Railway. Unfortunately, this meeting, which started in May 1930 and ended in 1931 with the outbreak of the September 18th Incident, was delayed by the Soviet side and involved many complications, and ultimately yielded no results.</p>
<p>Conspiracy and Incident</p>
<p>The actions of Japanese imperialists in the Northeast since 1905 have claimed to be based on the Beijing Treaty of December 25 of that year and the so-called "protocol" (in fact, there is no such protocol). Since 1915, there has been the so-called exchange of notes of the Twenty-One Demands. Although this exchange of notes was signed by President Yuan Shikai under the pressure of Japanese military force, it was rejected and not ratified by the National Assembly. According to the constitution applicable in China at that time, any treaty not ratified by the National Assembly could not take effect. China raised this issue at the Paris Peace Conference and the Washington Conference. Although the powers at that time were afraid of Japan's violence and were unable to formally force Japan to withdraw, morally, all countries have long recognized that China is right and Japan is wrong. The September 18th Incident, launched by Japan on the pretext that the outstanding issues had not been resolved, has no basis other than violence.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the September 18th Incident, the slogan advocated by Japan was to resolve the outstanding issues between China and Japan. After its military actions succeeded, it revealed its true colors. It created the "incident" first, and then created the "puppet state." The "Manchukuo" was actually just a convenient term for Japan's rule and compromise after it occupied our Northeast by force.</p>
<p>On March 1, 1934, Puyi declared himself emperor. On March 23, 1935, the agreement for Japan to buy the Chinese Eastern Railway was signed. On July 15, the Japanese puppet regime signed an economic agreement in Changchun, establishing the Japan-Manchukuo Economic Joint Committee as the supreme advisory body for Japan's development of the Northeast's economy. On September 26, it suppressed British and American banks. On June 11, 1936, the Japanese puppet regime signed a new agreement, taking the gradual abolition of extraterritorial rights as a pretext for Japan to obtain all the same rights as the people of Manchuria and Mongolia in terms of residence, travel, employment, and land. By November 5, 1937, the Japanese puppet regime formally signed an agreement abolishing extraterritorial rights in Manchuria. On December 30, 1939, Japan and Wang Jingwei signed a secret agreement, stipulating that Wang Jingwei must recognize the puppet Manchukuo. On December 8, 1941, Japan declared war on Britain and the United States, and at the same time incited Wang Jingwei and the puppet Manchukuo to declare war on Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>Distressing Phenomena</p>
<p>It is natural that the compatriots who have suffered so many years of hardship are eager for our National Army to enter smoothly. But the most distressing thing is that the Communist Army's destructive and disruptive actions on the Shenyang railway line in the Northeast have not yet been effectively stopped. General Malinovsky of the Soviet Army also said that Dalian is not in his military district, expressing that he cannot assist in the takeover of Dalian. In addition, the National Army's airlift to the Northeast is already large in scale in itself, so this delayed advance cannot but "cause a feeling of impatience" (see our newspaper's Beiping dispatch on the 24th). In a helpless mood, we hope that all this can be completed in a lightning-like advance before New Year's Day, in the fastest possible way. (To be continued in Part 2 tomorrow.)</p>
<p>The Bustling Area of Shenyang City</p>
<p>Shenyang is the commercial center of the Northeast. Since its establishment, it has been more than 2,000 years old, and the population density is higher than in other areas of the Northeast. There is a medical university with quite complete equipment.</p>
<p>Crystallization of Ancient Traditional Art in the Northeast</p>
<p>The roofs, doors, or walls of folk dwellings, temples, and administrative agencies in the Northeast are often carved with traditional symbolic carvings, which are enough to glimpse the civilian life and religious emotions of our people. Pictured: Stone carvings on the wall of a lama temple, the technique is very exquisite.</p>
<h3>Berlin Shrouded in Grim Mist: Hunger, Despair, Disease, Death – Stranded Refugees Struggle in the Ruins</h3>
<p>Wending your way through the ruined streets of Berlin, your eyes meet with nothing but rubble, refuse, and wreckage, until finally you reach the train station. Around you are the survivors of the war, German refugees who have tasted every bitterness. They emanate a fearful stench of hunger and disease. Their hollow eyes reflect their half-crazed state of mind. They are shrouded in a kind of deathly silence.</p>
<p>You begin to pick out an individual from this chaotic mass and speak with them. Their face immediately flashes with a look of anger and disappointment, and you know they have a painful story to tell. Others join in the conversation. As they talk, some shouting, some weeping, tired arms gesturing, the tragedy of the German refugees is reflected before our very eyes.</p>
<p>Although the Allied military government had issued orders prohibiting newcomers from entering Berlin, within just one month, 550,000 German refugees violated the order, causing considerable disturbance, and the</p>
<p>German Refugees Crossing the Border</p>
<p>are still increasing daily. About ten million German refugees, displaced during the war, are facing the same fate.</p>
<p>Released prisoners of war from Soviet concentration camps, Germans from the Sudetenland expelled by the Czechs, all German minorities driven out of Poland, residents of East Prussia and Silesia, and millions of men, women, and children east of the Oder-Neisse line, swept up by the torrent of war, are being driven towards Berlin under a terrible force.</p>
<p>Approximately 15,000 people arrive in Berlin daily, transported by three or four trains. The rooftops, between the carriages, even the footboards, are packed full. In theory, there is an organization specifically designated to handle these German refugees, to examine their health, provide them with food, and guide their actions. This is a German organization, because from the perspective of the United Nations, this is purely a German problem. But in reality... let's go to the train station to see what's actually happening.</p>
<p>At six o'clock in the afternoon, the train from the east is already delayed, and still has not arrived. A German station worker believes that it won't be too late today, because it's almost time for the last train of the day, and in fact there is only</p>
<p>One Train Making Round Trips</p>
<p>Finally, the train arrives.</p>
<p>The refugees slowly descend from the train, slower than you would expect. After hours of an agonizing journey, they now shuffle forward, their weary eyes filled with questions, their trembling (often bandaged) hands carrying their meager belongings. Bare feet, red, swollen, covered in blood and dirt, some wrapped in rags. Some wear their best "Sunday shoes," others have managed to grab a pair of sturdy hiking boots.</p>
<p>The air is filled with German: "Where</p>
<p>are we supposed to go</p>
<p>now?" "Can you tell me...?" "I'm starving!" Yes, they are hungry, and they also need water. One or two German Red Cross officials are surrounded. They want to help the refugees, answer their questions. But they are truly powerless. The refugees have not eaten for days, and there is still nothing here to give them, they are starving to death. Drinking water is also very scarce and dirty. There are also no cooking utensils.</p>
<p>Soon, this new group of refugees joins those who arrived yesterday and the day before, trudging on; passing through Berlin. Many remain at the train station, haggard, helpless, wandering, desperate.</p>
<p>"Where did you come from?" Oh, it's unbearable to hear. They have thousands of different experiences, but their tragic fate is the same. Luggage? A young girl shouts angrily: "Those damned Poles... they stole everything!" But, we should also remember how the German army ravaged this defeated country when Germany invaded Poland.</p>
<p>"Look at him—eighty years old, blind, with no relatives to rely on..." Their circumstances are worse than each other. They have lost everything, have nothing to eat, nothing to wear, they stink, their clothes are full of lice, and one girl was raped on the way. Because on this road there are gangs of Polish orphans, who lost their parents during the war, were not educated, and turned into</p>
<p>Criminal Thugs</p>
<p>They are armed with knives and pistols, specializing in robbing refugees, plundering their only possessions, such as watches, rings, wallets, etc. But they can't rob money, because the refugees have no money. Those adult thugs often take advantage of the danger to rape single women. You can easily recognize these women, they are unable to cry, simply mad.</p>
<p>Who will take care of these refugees? Strictly speaking, the social bureau of the Berlin city government originally had forty-eight temporary shelters, prepared to</p>
<p>accommodate 30,000</p>
<p>refugees every day. But some were closed because infectious diseases were discovered, some were requisitioned by the Allied forces, and the rest, although they exist, are unable to provide half a pound of bread and two bowls of watery soup to the refugees passing through, according to the planned schedule, due to food shortages. At the same time, because there are too few doctors, they cannot check their health. Most refugees suffer from dysentery.</p>
<p>How many refugee shelters are there really? Many people disappear on the road. Many people don't have the strength to go on. There are also many people who want to take the train back to their hometown to see if there is anything left to salvage, so they hide in the station. When you hear them complaining among them, they will suddenly interject: "See, over there, someone is about to die!" That's the ruins of platform number two, where a hundred trains used to arrive and depart every day before the war, never late. Now, a cattle car has been converted into a "corpse car." The car is filled with the dead and dying. The dead bodies are labeled with tags that read: "Body awaiting collection."</p>
<p>Leaving the station, the refugees first go to the Berlin City Hall to check their identity cards. Those without identity cards are reissued, and their intended destination is determined. There are only two hundred people working there, but they have to deal with 20,000 people, so of course they can't keep up. "This is your number, come back tomorrow." For many people, tomorrow never comes. Those who come back tomorrow, crane their necks, stretch their ears, waiting for their number to be called. When their turn comes, a fleeting moment of relief appears on their gloomy faces, and at the same time, their dull eyes</p>
<p>Flash a ray of hope</p>
<p>But doubts return. Is it a smart idea to follow the Allies' instructions? What is it like elsewhere? There are many rumors: "Did you see those corpses by the roadside? And those bodies hanging from the trees?" Death threatens not only Berlin, but lurks everywhere. Yet most people still place their hopes in the future. Can the future be even worse? Leaving here, going anywhere, can't be worse than here, right?</p>
<p>Anyone who wants to go to the British and American zones must first apply to the Allied military government in Berlin for approval. At the same time, those who have not been issued an exit permit by the Soviet army are not allowed to leave Berlin. Therefore, the streets of Berlin are filled with desperate refugees, holding various documents in their hands, crowding and struggling back and forth. A German officer, released from a Soviet prisoner-of-war camp,</p>
<p>Treks Thousands of Miles to Berlin</p>
<p>not knowing if his hometown was bombed, whether his wife and children are still alive. He inquires, hopes, and finally exhausts the last of his strength, collapsing on the road home. There are also emaciated mothers and babies on the road, as well as blind or disabled soldiers. They hope that the situation will be better elsewhere. But roses will not bloom in the post-war ruins.</p>
<p>Every day, tens of thousands of German refugees are transported from despair into Berlin's train stations, and tens of thousands of German refugees leave Berlin and are transported into new despair. Post-war Germany is filled with hunger, disease, despair, and death, and the fate of German refugees is the same everywhere. To this day, they have tasted the bitter fruits of Nazism, let them curse the crimes of the Nazi war demons for the rest of their lives!</p>
<h3>Secret Weapon of the English Channel: The Inside Story of Undersea Oil Pipelines – A Great Land-and-Sea Two-Story Invention</h3>
<p>During the Allied landings in Normandy, France, the inexhaustible gasoline supply of the Anglo-American mechanized units that struck directly at the Nazi lair in Eastern Europe was truly a miracle! German reconnaissance planes tried their best to search for traces of Allied oil tankers in the skies above the English Channel, but the Allied armored forces continued to advance fiercely. Britain's astonishing secret of wartime gasoline transportation has now been revealed. The British call this secret thing "Pluto," and to put it more clearly, it is an undersea oil pipeline.</p>
<p>Undersea Oil Transportation Method – The Enemy Knew Nothing</p>
<p>The enemy knew nothing about this unprecedented method of oil transportation. From the summer to the winter of 1944, one million gallons of oil were transported from England to France every day via undersea pipelines. Subsequently, it was extended to Belgium, the Netherlands, and even deep into German territory, as far as the city of Frankfurt on the Main River.</p>
<p>Like the Mulberry harbors previously built off the coast of Normandy, "Pluto" is the crystallization of the combined invention of British scientific minds and British industry.</p>
<p>"Pluto" was also planned and completed in secret. Months before the collapse of the German forces under Commander-in-Chief Rundstedt, four oil pipelines had already crossed the English Channel, connecting the Isle of Wight with Cherbourg in France, while sixteen other oil pipelines ran from Dungeness across the 30-mile channel, connecting with Port-en-Bessin in France, directly reaching Antwerp and the Rhine area.</p>
<p>Regarding this "unique method," former British Prime Minister Churchill said: "This method of supplying gasoline on the enemy's coast is as convenient as using the Mulberry harbors as supply stations for general supplies." He also said: "The completion of the 'Pluto' oil transportation method is a great achievement of the British and a testament to the British's proud land-and-sea two-story engineering skills.</p>
<p>Minister of Gasoline Warfare – Raises the Question of Oil Pipelines</p>
<p>Marshal Rundstedt and other captured German generals all admitted that the German army's disastrous defeat was largely due to the overwhelming superiority of the Allied gasoline supply. It was generally acknowledged that a large amount of gasoline was needed across the English Channel, but gasoline and oil tankers were the best targets for enemy naval and air attacks.</p>
<p>In April 1942, the Minister of Gasoline Warfare, Loyd, working in secret, already had this idea. He asked Sir Louis whether there was a solution to the oil pipeline problem. The answer he received was: "Yes, can you lay a pipeline under the English Channel?" Loyd asked many experts, and they all said it was impossible. Undersea oil pipelines require high-pressure pumping stations, which are economically unfeasible to budget for. Oil tankers are much cheaper, and laying pipelines under the turbulent English Channel is an astonishing engineering feat due to the constantly changing weather and the rapid tides. The element of risk is extremely high.</p>
<p>Engineer Hartley – Turns "Impossible" into "Possible"</p>
<p>Even so, this is war, and everything requires extraordinary measures. Soon after, an expert came up with a practical plan. This person's name was Hartley, the chief engineer of the British (Iranian) Oil Company. His plan was to use undersea cable-laying ships to lay a pipe similar to an undersea telegraph cable under the channel, simply by making it hollow and removing the "insulation" or "isolation." Within 24 hours, hundreds of yards of this unique pipe were manufactured in the Siemens factory. In less than half a month, a post office cable-laying ship had begun its testing work near the Thames Estuary, near Chatham.</p>
<p>The great success of the "HAIS" (Hartley-Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Siemens) joint pipe production further inspired the British to expand their ambitions for testing. Another undersea cable company, called "Henleys," immediately joined the collaboration, capable of producing a 30-mile-long oil pipeline to be laid under the Bristol Channel between Swansea and Ilfracombe. The environment and situation there are similar to those of the English Channel.</p>
<p>In December 1942, a large ship capable of towing such a heavy and unusual oil pipeline was equipped as a general undersea cable-laying ship. Named HMS "Holdfast," after many difficulties, on the calm coast of "North Devon," at the Ilfracombe end, oil flowed continuously from the pipeline, proving that the plan was feasible.</p>
<p>This was a comprehensive experimental plan. The diameter of the pipe was expanded to two to three inches, the conveying capacity was strengthened to over 1,200 pounds per square inch, and the technicians of the British Royal Army Service Corps worked hard to research all the procedures and methods of high-pressure pumping and storage technology.</p>
<p>Hamil Pipeline – Also Declared Experiment Successful</p>
<p>In addition, another type of oil pipeline was also tested. This pipeline was designed jointly by Ellis, the chief engineer of the Burma Oil Company, and Hamil, the chief engineer of the Iraq Petroleum Company, and was named the "Hamil" type. At the National Physical Laboratory, with the assistance of various engineering companies, a 20-foot-long, three-inch pipe could be welded to any length, rolled onto a drum, and then straightened. The diameter of the drum should be at least 30 feet.</p>
<p>To test this method, the Admiralty first converted a small ship into the "Poseidon" type, with a giant wheel installed on the deck that could rotate on the drum ears. Then, a floating drum-shaped wheel was manufactured to carry enough pipe for the entire channel length. Stewarts &amp; Lloyds engineering plant then followed this design, began construction, and established a factory specializing in welding 20-foot-long pipes to a length of 4,000 feet, loading 10 miles of pipe every day.</p>
<p>"Pluto" Force – Two Main Bases Established</p>
<p>Six giant drum wheels were manufactured, named "HMS Conundrum," or "Conun" for short, moored at the end of the pipeline, allowing lengths of 40 feet to be welded into continuous lines of 30 miles or more. When rolling, they could be rolled onto the "Conun" in an orderly manner. Each "Conun" weighed 1,600 tons, was 90 feet long, and 50 feet in diameter, and could carry 70 miles of oil pipeline. The barrels currently carrying oil pipelines are 40 feet in diameter.</p>
<p>The above two types of oil pipelines were successfully put into trial use in April 1943, and the Royal Navy began pipe-laying work, and the "Pluto" force was established at the same time. Its main base was in Southampton, and the second base was in Tilbury. One hundred officers and one thousand merchant ships participated in the work under the command of the Admiralty. Ships of all classes, from 10,000-ton ships to various small boats and motorboats, were available. "Conun" was used to handle Hamil-type oil pipelines, while HAIS-type oil pipelines were carried by four specially converted merchant ships, with Thames River boats assisting on the shore, because the water there was too shallow for large ships to operate.</p>
<p>Oil Delivered to the Front Line – Exceeds 120 Million Gallons</p>
<p>Even the "Conun" being towed by those two barges, meandering across the channel, was never attacked by the Germans. The German Air Force thought these were insignificant things. After Port-en-Bessin was recovered and the mines were cleared, almost 500 miles of oil pipeline connected Port-en-Bessin and Dungeness again. The Cherbourg pipeline became secondary. The Royal Engineers then installed a large set of continuous oil pipelines, passing through northern France, Belgium, all the way to Antwerp, so that gasoline could be transported directly from the oil tankers on the Liverpool docks, through the pipelines, to the Rhine area, until the Allies fired the last shot. The amount of oil delivered directly to the front-line units through this pipeline exceeded 120 million gallons.</p>
<p>"Pluto" Applied in All Allied Occupation Zones</p>
<p>These "Pluto" oil pipelines are still in full use today. About one million gallons of oil are still being delivered to the occupying forces and the people of the liberated areas every day. As for whether this will continue into the future, it doesn't matter, because this was originally an emergency work of British factories, and the efficiency and success both reached the highest level. At the same time, a large number of oil tankers were able to be withdrawn to deal with the anti-Japanese war in the Pacific. (Translated by Ming from this newspaper's translation department)</p>
<p>Northeast coal is the most abundant mineral in the entire territory, totaling 200 million metric tons. Second is iron. Other deposits such as gold, steel, iron, and placer gold are also extremely abundant, even sufficient for hundreds of years of use.</p>

<h3>Affiliation Issues of Trade Associations</h3>
<p>— Luo Qinghua</p>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai National Medicine Commercial Trade Association completed its reorganization. It legally convened a membership representative assembly, revised its constitution, and re-elected directors and supervisors. It was discovered that among those elected, many had served as directors and supervisors of the association during the city's occupation. At that time, a representative from a certain agency, citing Article 15 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors, which states, "Those who have held positions in puppet organizations and their affiliated agencies or groups, and have not been convicted under these regulations, shall still be ineligible to be candidates for public office or be appointed as civil servants for a certain period," argued that those who had been elected as directors and supervisors of the association during the occupation should not be eligible for election this time. As a result, the association's election could not be completed that day, and the directors and supervisors were not elected in accordance with the regulations, leading to the adjournment of the membership assembly. After this incident, more than 190 trade associations in Shanghai that were in the process of reorganization and restructuring, fearing similar situations, dared not schedule membership representative assemblies to carry out re-elections and complete the reorganization work, but instead watched and waited. Moreover, the current reorganization committee members of more than 190 trade associations were nominated by each trade association with double the required number, reported to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce for review, and then submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for selection of three to seven members to be appointed as reorganization committee members of each association. It is heard that some of them were elected as officials of their respective associations during the occupation. If they are all prohibited from holding public office, then the current appointment as reorganization committee members seems to be illegal. Consequently, their morale is low, and they are collectively considering resigning. Not only will the reorganization work be unable to move forward, but also the daily affairs of the associations will come to a standstill. The grassroots organizations of industry and commerce throughout the city will all enter a state of inactivity. Now that the restoration has just begun, everything is waiting to be rebuilt, and all require the use of the organizational strength of trade associations to promote efficiency. If the actions of trade associations are hindered in an invisible way, it cannot be said that this is not a serious problem at present. To investigate the root cause, it is necessary to first distinguish: Does the trade association have any affiliation system with any political organization?</p>
<p>It is found that in the past, puppet organizations, relying on the enemy's breath, spared no effort to destroy and reorganize our administrative system and social organizations. After the Pacific War, the enemy and puppet forces invaded the concessions. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce was forcibly seized and personnel were sent to take over, and it was soon reorganized into the puppet Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. However, they did not carry out the same takeover of the various trade associations. This is because the puppet organizations also knew that trade associations were the grassroots organizations of each industry, with companies and firms in the industry joining as members. Store owners or managers were nominated as membership representatives. Those who served as directors and supervisors were always elected because they possessed economic conditions and service capabilities, and their credit and experience in the industry were widely respected. The nature of trade associations is different from that of general social organizations, which are based on individuals as members, and participation is entirely based on individual will. Their organization has a historical nature, is fixed and less prone to change. It cannot be destroyed by violence overnight, nor can it be arbitrarily transformed based on likes and dislikes. Therefore, puppet organizations did not dare to seize the various trade associations without authorization. Although the various associations held re-elections when their terms expired, it was merely a change of personnel within the industry. During the puppet organization era, there was never any appointment of directors and supervisors of the association by the puppet organization. This is because they knew that the situation did not allow it. Therefore, the situation of trade associations is completely different from the nature of commercial control committees, rice control committees, and cotton control committees under the administrative jurisdiction of the puppet organization. The former is a public interest group of the industry, with a long history, and its officials are elected by the industry to maintain and promote the public interests of the industry, and to correct malpractices. The latter is an economic group of the puppet organization, a temporary organization created by the evil forces of the enemy and puppets, and its officials are hired by the puppet organization to help the enemy and puppets collect materials and control distribution as their duties. During the occupation period, industry and commerce in the occupied areas suffered the destruction and persecution of the enemy and puppets, and traitors relying on evil forces also seized, exploited, and exhausted every means. Industry and commerce lost the protection of the motherland. Under the dark atmosphere, there was no way to appeal to heaven or enter the earth. The only thing they could rely on to preserve the remnants was the trade association of each industry, which was still a place for the industry to share weal and woe and encourage each other. However, those who served as directors and supervisors at that time, disregarding the ancient訓訓 of "wise men protecting themselves," endured humiliation and bore heavy burdens under the trampling of the enemy and puppets, sheltering the industry and sacrificing themselves for the public interest. Such dedication of loyal subjects and abandoned sons is truly commendable. Moreover, during this period, the various trade associations in Shanghai were able to not forget the motherland, cooperate with the underground work of the party and government, and not cooperate with the enemy and puppets in every possible way. There are historical facts to prove this. Regarding donations, comforting troops, public bonds, winter clothing donations, etc., all those launched and advocated by the Great Rear Area were enthusiastically responded to by the various trade associations in the city, regardless of difficulties and dangers, and they participated in almost every campaign. The last time was the solicitation of US dollar alliance victory bonds in the autumn of the 30th year. When the Central Solicitation Committee sent personnel to Shanghai, the cadres and comrades of the various trade associations in the city immediately launched a response. At that time, it was on the eve of the Pacific War, and the enemy and puppet forces had already invaded the concessions. The various trade associations still disregarded all dangers and remitted money to Chongqing under the aliases of Chunji and Huaji to subscribe to public bonds. Within a few months, the total amount of subscriptions exceeded that of any prosperous city in the Great Rear Area. At that time, the subscribers only obtained a bank remittance receipt and did not calculate anything else. To this day, all the aforementioned bonds are still kept in Chongqing, and are still summarized and kept by the custody committee. They have not been exchanged for the subscribers. This alone is enough to show that the people of various industries in Shanghai cherish the motherland and are enthusiastic. This is truly a national spirit and is extremely precious. In Shanghai, which had been occupied for a long time and was under severe coercion at that time, this contribution was particularly rare and commendable, and worthy of special mention.</p>
<p>History says, "When Emperor Gao of Han entered Guanzhong, he made a covenant of three chapters to renew the relationship with the people." Now that the mountains and rivers are rebuilt and the sky and the sun are shining again, the enemy and puppet's severe penalties and harsh laws were a hundred times more than those of Qin, and the people's enthusiasm for welcoming the return is far greater than in ancient times. Therefore, the first priority of the restored area at present is to stabilize people's hearts. To strictly distinguish between loyalty and treachery, and to declare the admonition of rewarding good and punishing evil. In the past, the industrial and commercial circles were inevitably home to some scoundrels who were blinded by greed, acted as accomplices of the enemy, and relied on the power of the enemy and puppets to infringe on the industry, search for materials, and commit many evils. Some have already been detained and are being tried. Some are still at large and waiting to be reported. We advocate punishing these pests and shameless scoundrels to the full extent of the law, without any leniency. However, the majority of good merchants must be appeased, pacified, and encouraged. Regarding the past directors and supervisors of the association, if their actions show that they did not rely on power to harm the motherland, they should be sympathized with for their encounters and not be overly demanding. If they endured humiliation, sheltered the industry, disregarded danger, and cared for the motherland, they should be commended for their hard work and dedication.</p>
<p>The "Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors" promulgated by the National Government this time has a total of sixteen articles, which are concise and comprehensive. After careful consideration of the meaning of the law, it is in line with the spirit of "annihilating the chief culprit and not discussing the coerced." The second article first states, "Those who collude with enemy countries and have one of the following acts are traitors." Then it lists fourteen crimes. The meaning of the text is clear and there is absolutely no confusion, so as to prevent the abuse of implication and involvement. The meaning of the law is very clear. The goodness of the legislative technique is rarely seen before. The original Article 15 of the regulations aims at those who serve as officials of puppet organizations, or those who hold positions in agencies and groups under their jurisdiction. Even if their actions do not meet any of the fourteen articles listed in the second article, and they cannot be convicted according to the regulations, but as citizens, they recognize thieves as fathers and accept puppet orders to serve in puppet positions, they should also be punished by reputation law. During a "certain period of time, they shall not be candidates for public office or be appointed as civil servants." At this point, only one question needs to be asked: Is the trade association "affiliated" with the puppet organization? Are the directors and supervisors of the association puppet officials appointed by the puppet organization? It is known that the trade association is a people's organization and does not belong to the puppet organization, nor does it belong to any government agency at any time. The directors and supervisors are elected by the members, not appointed by the puppet organization. The original regulations focus on the two words "affiliated," which refer to groups under the jurisdiction of puppet organizations such as commercial control committees, and do not involve trade associations. The meaning of the law is very clear.</p>
<p>Furthermore, trade associations are legal entities. According to civil law, they are non-profit social legal entities. The status of their directors and supervisors is the same as that of corporate directors and supervisors of for-profit enterprises, as mentioned in the same law. The government allows newly established companies in the restored area that were registered in puppet organizations during the war to supplement their registration, and has not interfered with the directors and supervisors. Then, should there be any difference in treatment for the association directors and supervisors of social legal entities? Referencing Article 2, Item 10 of the "Regulations on Handling Traitor Cases" promulgated on November 23: "Personnel of cultural, financial, industrial, free professional, autonomous or social groups within the jurisdiction of the enemy and puppets, who use the power of the enemy and puppets to infringe on others, and are reported or accused," is enough to prove that people's organizations in the occupied areas are all within the jurisdiction of the enemy and puppets, but have no affiliation. Whether they constitute a crime depends on whether their actions "rely on the power of the enemy and puppets to infringe on others, and are reported or accused."</p>
<p>Based on the above, it is known that merely serving as a director or supervisor of a trade association during the occupation period, and not participating in agencies or groups affiliated with the puppet organization, does not meet the provisions of Article 15 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors. People in industry and commerce do not need to be alarmed or resentful. The competent authorities, who have the responsibility of guidance and supervision, will also be able to act according to the law and reason, and will not forcibly confuse matters, causing more disturbances.</p>
<p>The highest leader has earnestly explained the importance of economic construction, and hopes that the industrial and commercial circles will be the main body and exert their automatic power. President Song also emphasized that the industrial and commercial circles should not have a dependence mentality, and must use the power of unity to achieve high economic ideals. At present, the restoration and construction of the country and the economic revival are complex and multifaceted. All industries are expected to bear the responsibility of the times, have experience, and be able to play a leading role in various industries, and jointly shoulder the mission, cooperate with national policies, and seize this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Implicating and litigating is forbidden since ancient times. Moreover, at a time when the country needs talents urgently, destroying talents without reason is a loss to the national strength. We must pay attention to this again and again.</p>

<h3>Gold Market Gradually Becomes Stagnant, Speculators Compete to Purchase US Dollars, Securities Firms Push Up Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>The range of gold prices has narrowed even further since yesterday. Speculations inside and outside the industry that the official exchange rate will be set before the Lunar New Year are becoming increasingly strong. General sentiment holds that once the exchange rate is fixed, gold will inevitably remain stagnant for a long period. As a result, attention has shifted to US dollars and Chinese and foreign stocks, causing the gold market to turn stagnant with few special changes. The market opened flat and weak in the morning, once falling slightly to around 805,000. Later, as the US dollar market rose again, a buying spree was triggered, pushing the price back to around 830,000. However, due to the approaching holiday, retail investors sold off at high prices, making it difficult to sustain. At noon, the price retreated to around 815,000. In the afternoon, the market struggled around 810,000, eventually closing down slightly by 5,000 compared to the previous day. Gold jewelry was priced at 87,000, and silver taels remained at 600 yuan. Silver dollars fell to below 440 due to slightly sluggish sales, with smaller coins even lower by 10 yuan. The dark exchange rate was stable, and supply and demand were also balanced. Generally, New Year's money market interest rates are around one corner (10%) for ordinary deals or at nine fen. External demanders pay higher interest rates, approximately one corner to one corner two fen (10-12%).</p>
<p>US dollars continue to be favored by many parties when prices drop. General sentiment holds that the official exchange rate will not be too far from reality, and that import merchants will not face unexpected risks in bringing goods in as local commodity prices have remained stable lately. Accordingly, they have been busy purchasing and storing US dollars in preparation for settling payments. The market was once vibrant, opening at 1,400 in the morning and then rising to 1,445 yuan. At noon, the price slightly retreated, hovering around 1,430 yuan. The afternoon was also quite calm. The market closed up slightly by 15 yuan compared to the previous day. Hong Kong dollars have become stable, with old notes and new notes both rising by 5 yuan and 4 yuan respectively.</p>
<p>Government bonds have gradually returned to calmness from their recent surge. Market professionals have decided to close shop from tomorrow until the fourth day of the Lunar New Year. The market is stagnant as it lacks activity. Prices have retreated slightly by 10 yuan to 35 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Chinese stocks have become the target of speculators. As the gold market is trending towards stagnation and the US dollar market is gradually reaching saturation, major and retail investors have been actively involved in the stock market. Chinese stocks are the capital market for Chinese industry and commerce. Logically, there is no reason to permanently prohibit transactions. Today, the North China Daily News also called for the resumption of securities and stock exchanges as soon as possible. Expectations from all parties are even more urgent, and the prospects are broader and unrestricted. In addition, securities firms are taking advantage of the momentum to aggressively push up prices, hoping to create a peak closing. As a result, prices have risen even faster. Although there were some twists and turns along the way due to some selling off at high prices, the market still hovered at high prices at noon. Small-cap stocks, which were previously unpopular, are still gradually becoming active. The market closed up around 50 yuan compared to the previous day for popular large-cap stocks. The three small hot stocks rose by 5 yuan to 10 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks continued to be strong yesterday. Ewo Yarns, Ewo Brewery, and Paper Industries saw more active trading. Bidding prices were prevalent for all unpopular stocks. Rubber stocks, which had been dormant for a long time, are now of even less value, and demand from buyers is high, resulting in little to no supply. As a result, Ewo Yarns closed up 20 yuan compared to the previous day, Ewo Brewery up 10 yuan, and Paper Industries up 45 yuan. Unpopular stocks and rubber stocks all closed at bidding prices, with no one willing to sell.</p>
<h3>Yarn Prices Continue to Rise, with Sales in Both Local and Outlying Areas</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market was as solid as a rock. Local weaving mills still have appetite for fine yarns, and prices have risen by another 20,000 to 30,000. 20-count yarns from retail distributors in Sichuan, Jiangxi, and other regions continue to see increases of 5,000 to 10,000 yuan. 16-count yarns saw mixed results, with Guangming rising by around 5,000. The trend of public sentiment towards stability is quite calm.</p>
<h3>Northern Routes Are Still Lively, Grain Prices Are Stable</h3>
<p>The Chaozhou trading house continues to handle soybean cakes.</p>
<p>Both the Northern-style japonica and indica rice markets saw weak sales, while the Southern-style japonica rice market was brisk in both sales and purchases, as Qingdao and Tianjin both have appetite. Therefore, the early rice and thin rice are still active. Retail sales in this area are still sluggish. Prices are little changed from yesterday. White money and Yin money still have very few transactions. Soybean retail demand is still acceptable. The market is stable. Flour sales to outlying areas are weak, and local flour is coming to market, retreating 100 yuan. Miscellaneous brands are even less sought after. The oil market is slightly weak, down 300 to 500 yuan. Sesame and raw kernels are firmly established. The Chaozhou trading house continues to handle soybean cakes, and the market is becoming active again. Prices have risen by nearly 100 yuan. The wine market is selling very well, with little inventory. The market looks strong.</p>
<h3>Stove Users Compete to Purchase, Yangquan Filtered Coal Lumps Surge, Firewood Is Consistently Strong</h3>
<p>Since stove coal users began competing to purchase white coal filtered lumps, Yangquan filtered lumps have fallen short of demand. Market prices are rising steadily and rapidly. The highest asking price has reached 400,000 yuan. The most recent transaction was at 380,000 yuan. The remaining prices are stable with little change. Daily arrivals of firewood have sharply decreased. Charcoal traders are taking advantage of the opportunity to generally hold back and wait for prices to rise. Market prices are consistently strong.</p>
<h3>Asphalt Turns from Weak to Buoyant</h3>
<p>After being slightly weak at the beginning of the week, asphalt has recently turned buoyant again. Hangzhou news reports that premium goods have been sold for 15,000 yuan. He news reports that local cargo oil has been sold for 19,000 yuan. Local traders in this city sold local Kaihe for 21,000 yuan. Lanxi Baishen sold for 18,000 yuan, and Hanma Chengyou for 15,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Australia Wheat Harvest Estimate</h3>
<p>(Reuters, Sydney, 29th) The Australian wheat harvest is estimated to be 134,800,000 bushels, compared to only 57,000,000 bushels last year.</p>
<h3>Commercial Situation Summary</h3>
<p>Sugar Market: Continuing the upward trend from the previous day, with merchants boosting prices, another increase was reported, and futures trading has opened.</p>
<p>Western Medicine: Supply and demand are balanced. According to news, Monsanto's saccharin factory has set a price of US$1.53, which translates to just over 2,000 yuan in legal tender.</p>
<p>Dried and Preserved Goods: Sales to outlying areas are strong. With gold prices reporting anomalies, market prices have risen accordingly.</p>
<p>Raw Silk: Market prices are stable, and trading is flat. Jili's market is robust due to strong demand from factories, with prices reaching 600,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Tea: High-grade baked green and stir-fried green teas are being absorbed by Tianjin merchants, with selling prices rising by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Coarse green tea has not been able to recover due to oversupply. News indicates that Guangzhou merchants are planning to handle red and green tea leaves.</p>
<p>Knitted Goods: The market opened weak but, as gold prices were slightly lower than the previous day, undershirts and socks also retreated slightly compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Cigarettes: Yesterday, due to the weekend, buyers were waiting and watching, and sellers were selling off, resulting in a gradual decline in market prices.</p>
<p>Silk: Prices have been rising for days, but the market softened yesterday. However, buyers are mostly staying out due to high prices, and trading is scarce.</p>
<h3>Reefs in the Export Industry of the Southern Islands: Vast Price Differences</h3>
<p>After the victory, domestic import and export traders have been hoping to develop trade with the Southern Islands. According to industry insiders, trade with the Southern Islands may be difficult to restore in the short term. The main reason is that, in the past eight years, commodity prices in China have risen by an average of 1,500 to 2,000 times, while commodity prices in the Southern Islands have risen by an average of only 500 to 100 times. Therefore, even if the new exchange rate is increased to 1,500 yuan, exporters will still be unable to make progress.</p>
<h3>Economic Briefs</h3>
<p>New prices for hotel rooms in this city have been agreed upon by relevant agencies and are said to be implemented from the first of the new year.</p>
<p>A large batch of medicinal materials from Hankou has arrived in Shanghai, including more than 380 pieces of honeysuckle, 72 pieces of rawhide, 100 pieces of pig bristles and pig hair, and 16 boxes of tea, all loaded on the Jiang'an Wheel. The Zhoushan Wheel also transported 36 packages of Yuyao flowers from Yong.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Commodity Tax Bureau recently announced that, as the end of the year is approaching, all merchants of yarn, cloth, sugar, Western beer, and local wine in the city who have failed to sell all of their goods within the deadline should pay supplementary taxes in accordance with regulations. Therefore, it is stipulated that each merchant must report the types, quantities, and storage locations of the above-mentioned inventory as of tomorrow to the bureau before January 10. Overdue reports will be treated as tax evasion.</p>
<p>The Jianghai Customs recently issued a notice stating: For local goods transported from one domestic port to another through a foreign port, regardless of the nationality of the carrying vessel, the export tax shall be collected by the customs at the port of origin, and the import tax shall be collected by the port of arrival.</p>
<p>Small silk factories and flour mills in Wuxi are currently preparing to resume operations. Silk factories are concerned that the output of Jiangnan raw silk is small and the selling price is too high, so there may not be significant development in the short term. Flour mills, however, will be able to resume operations more easily because the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has transported a large amount of wheat flour.</p>
<h3>Financial News</h3>
<p>According to Chongqing news, the National Bank is advocating for lower interest rates. The Central Bank's state-owned industrial loans have already been reduced to 2%. Recently, it is also planning to begin refinancing and rediscounting with a quota of 100 billion, and the interest rate may be suppressed to one-half of the original interest rate. (China, Transportation, Communication, and Agricultural Bank currently use 3.6% for loans. The Central Bank charges 2.7% for refinancing. Therefore, general banks are unwilling to refinance).</p>
<p>The Chongqing City Bank is scheduled to open on January 5, 35th year. Mayor Zhang will concurrently serve as chairman of the board, and Mr. Zhang Jiandong has been appointed as general manager. In order to restore all exchange transactions, exchange shops in Hong Kong must still pay attention to the provisions of Article 5 of the Defense Finance Regulations of 1940. All foreign currency income must be sold to HSBC, which is responsible for exchange control. However, the designated foreign currencies are not as extensive as in 1940. The specified types are as follows: (1) US dollars, (2) Canadian dollars, (3) Philippine pesos. It is also illegal to transport the above-mentioned currencies.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Issues Order to Investigate Whether Restored Area Commercial Banks Have Colluded with the Enemy</h3>
<p>According to Chongqing news, commercial banks in the restored area are now resuming operations one after another. In order to thoroughly rectify finance, the financial authorities have ordered each special commissioner's office to conduct a strict investigation of the commercial banks and businesses that have been provisionally approved to resume operations in each district, and have given the following two instructions: (1) Whether there have been any changes in the shareholding, licenses, and business guidelines of each commercial bank and business during the occupation period. (2) Whether each commercial bank has colluded with the enemy during the occupation period.</p>

<h3>One Aspect of Dealing with Old Cotton Yarn Godown Vouchers</h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>Having read a news item entitled "Cotton Yarn Merchants Pursue Old Godown Vouchers" in the Commercial News section of your esteemed newspaper on the 27th of this month, I find that many of the details mentioned therein do not accord with the facts as experienced by our factory. After investigation, the amount of cotton yarn stored in the godown by our factory on December 8th of the 30th year exceeded the amount deposited by the holders of the godown vouchers. The excess portion belonged to our factory, and thus was not fictitious. This is the first point to clarify. Furthermore, after December 8th, our factory was managed by the enemy Japanese army, and the stored cotton yarn, including that deposited by the godown voucher holders and that belonging to our factory, was forcibly "requisitioned" by them. We have "requisition orders" to prove this, which is entirely different from the purchase of cotton yarn. This is the second point to clarify. Subsequently, after strenuous negotiations, we managed to recover a portion of it. Following fair principles, we prepared an allocation list, which was published in the newspaper. Most of the godown voucher holders considered it appropriate and came to claim their share according to the allocation ratio. Therefore, our factory not only addressed the godown voucher issue early on but has also largely resolved it. This is the third point to clarify. Currently, with the victory of the War of Resistance, our factory has applied to the authorities for compensation for the losses suffered during the war. The losses suffered by the godown voucher holders are also included in our request for compensation. This proves that our factory has done everything possible to safeguard the interests of the godown voucher holders and has fulfilled its responsibilities as a trustee. This is the fourth point to clarify. To prevent misunderstandings arising from a lack of understanding of the true situation, we are clarifying the circumstances of our factory and hope you will publish this in the Commercial News section of your esteemed newspaper to dispel doubts and accord with the facts. Sincerely, Tung Yih Textile Co., Ltd., December 29th, Year 34.</p>

<p>Letters from Readers</p>
<h3>The Appeals of Out-of-School Youth - Please Consider This by the Organizers of the Provisional National University Preparatory Class</h3>
<p>Dear Editor: We humbly borrow a corner of your valuable newspaper with twelve points of sincerity to publish what we out-of-school youth want to say. I wonder if you will allow it? "Faithfulness" is an inherent Chinese virtue and a creed that everyone should adhere to. Who would have known that a solemn and grand university would go against its word! Mr. Editor! Isn't this strange news? Yesterday, in the "Education and Sports" section of your newspaper, I saw that the Provisional National University Preparatory Class held an entrance exam. The reason given was that "there were too many applicants, the school buildings were insufficient, and the documents of the students could not be verified immediately because the original schools no longer existed. An entrance exam was necessary for selection." However, looking back at the admissions brochure of the Provisional National University Preparatory Class, there was no mention that an additional exam was required due to too many applicants, or that an additional exam was required for unqualified documents. On the contrary, we saw how sympathetic they were to out-of-school youth and how concerned they were about out-of-school youth in their admissions brochure. Under the item of "Treatment," it stated that tuition was waived, and room and board were at one's own expense (students whose economic sources were cut off would be subsidized by the class upon verification). We were so moved by this preferential treatment that we were almost in tears. Because of this, we came from thousands of miles away with great hope and at great risk. We were determined to seek considerable knowledge to repay the country in the future, so as not to fail this preferential treatment, and we applied to the Provisional National University, waited for notification, prepared to attend classes, and reported to our families how wonderful the school was. Everything was like a flash in the pan, and the good dream was short-lived. How can we not blame the other petty thieves if the people who run education can be so fickle! We are not afraid of the exam, nor are we complaining. However, the spirit of our youth is fragile, and we cannot withstand repeated setbacks. Everyone knows the suffering we have endured in the past eight years. Enemy bandits, puppet soldiers, and bandits have emerged in endless varieties. Especially now, we are people who cannot return home! Who says it is victory? What does victory bring us? We only feel emptiness and hopelessness, we only feel sadness and decadence! Originally, it was appropriate for schools to have exams, and we cannot deny that. However, one or two thousand students were complaining that the school buildings were not enough and that an exam had to be added. What will happen to the students who fail the exam? Should they be blamed for their poor knowledge? Should they be blamed for not attending a puppet school or going to the Great Rear Area? Attending a puppet school is probably related to ideology, and going to the Great Rear Area is not economically feasible. Fortunately, the first item in the purpose section of the admissions brochure of the Provisional National University Preparatory Class clearly states that it is to provide remedial education for high school graduates who are out of school in order to prepare them for university. The qualifications are for graduates of public or private high schools, and the registration procedures are to submit a graduation certificate, a photo, and a guarantee. It is precisely because of poor knowledge that they come for remedial education. If they were good, why not apply directly to the university and go through the trouble of doing so? If it is said that the school buildings are not enough, why didn't they state it when the school was established that the school buildings were limited and that students from afar who were not sure of passing the exam should not come, causing students from afar to travel back and forth? Even more strangely, under the circumstance that the school buildings are not enough, only the room and board of the "students who are not pseudo" who do not need to take the exam can be provided for studying. On the contrary, the school buildings are not enough and an exam must be taken. I do not believe that the education of truth and falsehood is originally so one-sided. Mr. Editor! I have said so much above, and I am afraid that I have offended many great gentlemen, but if he is a great gentleman, he will surely be able to forgive my suffering, because we are from northern Jiangsu, we escaped from the bandit dens, we stole across the blocked port when there were ten thousand dangers, and now we look north to our homeland. Can't even the slightest cry of tears from us get their agreement? Therefore, I hope that the educational authorities will let us start classes soon, so that we can find a place to rely on in spirit and academics, and not let precious time be wasted day by day. We want to believe that the youth in the occupied areas who are in hardship and difficulty will never fail the country! Mr. Editor: This is a little cry from us out-of-school youth. Can it be published so that righteous people in society can make a more powerful appeal to the educational authorities on our behalf? We are extremely looking forward to it!</p>
<p>Sincerely wishing you peace! Sincerely, Zheng Xudong, Li Zhen, etc. of the out-of-school youth</p>

(3) Regarding the Central Trust Bureau's method of selling enemy and puppet furniture, the regulations stipulate that the Real Estate Department of the Central Trust Bureau should classify enemy and puppet furniture according to its nature, materials, style, type, condition (new or used), number, and registration, and after valuation, report it to the Handling Bureau for approval of the minimum price standard for separate sales. All furniture left in enemy and puppet properties, or attached to buildings as decorations, or inconvenient to move, should be sold to the tenant of the house as a principle. Other furniture that has been received and moved to warehouses, crude, old furniture, or sundries that have no value to move, will be sold directly to public institutions and public utilities, priced on consignment, entrusted to auction, or sold on-site. For detailed procedures, please contact the Central Trust Bureau for information.</p>
<p>Procedures for Secret Reports and Rewards</p>
<p>(4) Procedures for secret reports and rewards: (1) For all secret report cases, the secret reporter should be notified within half a month after the materials are discovered and confiscated, and proceed directly to the Investigation Team to apply for rewards. Cases that have been concluded in the past should be cleared immediately and the secret reporter notified to apply for rewards. A blank reward application form should be attached to this notice, to be filled out by the original secret reporter and sent directly to the Investigation Team. (2) The valuation of seized assets will be handled by the Accounting Advisory Committee. The Investigation Team should provide a list of the assets seized in each concluded case to the Accounting Advisory Committee at any time. The Accounting Advisory Committee should, upon receiving this notice, assess the price in turn and notify the Liquidation Office and the Investigation Team separately. If the seized assets are complex in variety, with different brands and forms, or are old and incomplete items such as factories, mines, farms, or houses, and the list cannot be easily itemized one by one, and the price cannot be determined, the Accounting Advisory Committee may estimate the total value or estimate the minimum price as the standard for calculating the bonus and disposing of the price. (3) According to Articles 5 and 7 of the Supplementary Measures for Encouraging Secret Reports, the Investigation Team may, after reviewing the reward application, issue part of the reward in kind or in cash, taking the circumstances of the case into consideration. (4) After the Investigation Team approves and registers the application according to the above, it will notify the secret reporter to come to the team to collect the reward certificate and go directly to the Liquidation Office to receive the reward. At the same time, the approved reward application and calculation sheet, etc., will be transferred to the Liquidation Office for issuing the reward. (5) According to Articles 1 and 2 of the Supplementary Measures for Encouraging Secret Reports, if the secret report of assets is verified and handed over to the receiving agency, or before the valuation and disposal, a part of the reward is issued first, the secret reporter should be given a reward certificate. This reward certificate will be issued by the Investigation Team. If it is handed over to the receiving agency, the Investigation Team will notify the Liquidation Office at the time of handover. If a part of the reward is issued first, the reward certificate will be given at the same time as the reward is issued.</p>
<h3>Zhou Yi, a Traitor, to be Tried by the High Court Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Zhou Yi, a Cantonese, held an important position in the Shanghai Petroleum United Branch of a Japanese company on North Sichuan Road during the enemy and puppet era. After being detained and interrogated, he was transferred to the High Procuratorate, which, after investigation, found him guilty and filed a public prosecution with the High Court based on Article 2 of the Regulations for Punishing Traitors. It is learned that the High Court has scheduled the case for formal trial on the morning of the 31st.</p>
<h3>Legal Tender and Gold Bars Prohibited from Being Carried to Taiwan</h3>
<p>Regarding the prohibition of passengers traveling to Taiwan from carrying legal tender and gold bars, according to the Shanghai Liaison Office of the Taiwan Provincial Administrative Office, legal tender is not commonly used in Taiwan and may disrupt the market. It is understood that the exchange rate for the Taiwan dollar currently in use there is approximately 20 to 30 yuan in Keelung. The office established by the Central Bank is actively planning the exchange of currency systems to gradually unify them with the mainland. Four or five days ago, the price of gold in Taiwan was about 3,400 Taiwan dollars per tael. In order to prevent unscrupulous merchants from taking advantage of the situation, it is also forbidden to carry gold bars.</p>
<h3>General Wedemeyer Claims No U.S. Troops in Northeast; Answers Various Questions at Press Conference Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] General Wedemeyer, Commander of the U.S. Forces in the China Theater, hosted a press conference for Chinese and foreign reporters at his office on the eighth floor of the Jiangxi Road Construction Building at 11:00 AM yesterday, answering various questions as follows: Regarding assisting China in transporting troops to the Northeast, it is currently underway. General Du Yuming's troops have been transported from Haiphong to Huludao, but have not yet reached the Northeast. Currently, there are 4,800 personnel and 400 vehicles, and a large number of troops are planned to be transported there. However, with the cold winter, the troops' cold-weather equipment is the biggest problem, and it will take considerable time to fully equip them. As for the allocation of materials, except for a portion borrowed from the U.S. and a portion of Japanese war spoils, all are provided by the Chinese government, that is, those obtained by the U.S. are also purchased by the Chinese government. General Wedemeyer specifically stated that there are no U.S. Marines in the Northeast.</p>
<p>Assistance in Building the Army Does Not Involve Other Matters</p>
<p>Regarding the U.S. military advisory group in China, General Wedemeyer stated that it has not yet been formally organized, and there is no definite news from Washington. However, if it is established, its mission will be entirely to assist China in building its army, navy, and air force, and it will not involve the Chinese government's economic, political, and other issues. Its general headquarters will be located where the Chinese government is located, possibly in Nanjing. The U.S. military headquarters will be located in Shanghai. General Wedemeyer does not know how long he himself will stay in China. He may be responsible for the initial work of the advisory group, but not necessarily as its permanent head.</p>
<p>Strictly Crack Down on Anti-Soviet Actions</p>
<p>A reporter asked about recent reports that some U.S. Navy personnel have been taking anti-Soviet actions. General Wedemeyer stated that he had heard of this matter when he was in Nanjing and is currently investigating it in detail. If such actions occur, he will severely punish them. He himself is engaged in military affairs and tries his best to avoid being partisan. Although he does not know the personal thoughts of every subordinate, he firmly believes that their actions have no political effect.</p>
<p>U.S. Military Work Not Difficult to Solve</p>
<p>Asked when U.S. military personnel who are idle and have no work will begin working, General Wedemeyer said that there are currently three problems that need to be resolved before there can be a lot of work: the U.S. military advisory group has not yet been formally established; if it is established, a part of the U.S. military must be left in China to work. There is a lot of work to be done when the enemy is withdrawn. When the Chinese government sends troops to the Northeast, if it starts immediately, it will also require the assistance of U.S. military personnel. The length of time the U.S. military stays in China also depends on the length of the withdrawal work. As for whether air force personnel have the opportunity to fly, General Stratemeyer, commander of the U.S. Air Force, replied that all current air force officers and soldiers have the opportunity to fly, and he is not aware of anyone who does not have the opportunity to fly. If such a situation exists, he would like to know.</p>
<p>Military Dependents Can Come Next Spring</p>
<p>A reporter asked when U.S. military personnel could bring their families to China. General Wedemeyer said that his subordinates have repeatedly raised this issue, but he has not yet received instructions from the U.S. military. If he were responsible for this matter, he would like to follow this rule: if ten officers can bring their dependents to China, then one hundred soldiers' dependents should come together. However, there is currently a lack of facilities and schools for children to study. He hopes that U.S. military families will be able to come here next spring. All travel expenses will be provided by the government.</p>
<p>Strict Punishment for Violations</p>
<p>Regarding incidents of U.S. military causing trouble, the U.S. military headquarters has repeatedly issued warnings and punishments, and will continue to enforce its rules, but in fact it is difficult to control. Regarding the waste and sale of military supplies by the U.S. military, the U.S. authorities have taken various measures to stop it, but hope that the Chinese people will also cooperate and not casually buy and sell military supplies. General Wedemeyer said that he has indeed taken various measures to persuade them to save, but he is reluctant to interfere with their personal freedom. At the same time, there is a lack of specialized personnel here to do surveillance work. He is now planning to hold court every evening to try personnel who violate the rules, and strict punishments will be imposed regardless of rank.</p>
<p>Regarding the withdrawal of enemy troops, it is estimated that 12,000 to 15,000 U.S. troops are required. There are currently about 8,000 to 10,000 U.S. troops in China, so some personnel will come to China from the U.S. Regarding the repatriation of enemy forces from Germany, Austria, etc., it has nothing to do with the U.S. military. Furthermore, matters concerning British, Soviet, and French affairs in China are all handled by themselves in consultation with the Chinese authorities.</p>
<p>Marshall's Visit to Beiping May Include Shanghai</p>
<p>General Wedemeyer also said that Marshal Marshall may pass through Shanghai when he goes to Beiping because there are still issues that need to be examined and studied. Wedemeyer believes that Marshall is a good soldier and statesman, and this visit to China has great significance in diplomacy and politics.</p>
<h3>All Wireless Radios Must Be Registered According to Law</h3>
<p>The person in charge of the Telecommunications Supervision Section of the Inspection Office of the Songhu Preparatory Headquarters stated: The purpose of control is primarily to prevent criminals from using wireless radio to transmit information, endanger national interests, and disrupt social stability. As the Shanghai area is vast and there are a large number of machines, it is impossible to inspect and supervise without starting with registration. All radio enthusiasts, radios, and manufacturers and merchants selling wireless radios within this garrison area must register according to law for management purposes. The various procedures handled by the section are handled in accordance with legal procedures, and efforts will be made to be simple and convenient for the parties concerned. Those who have not completed the registration procedures must go to the section of the Inspection Office on the sixth floor of the Preparatory Headquarters Building at the North Sichuan Road Bridge as soon as possible to complete the procedures.</p>

The bureau has approved it and formulated an application form for supplementary payment of stamp tax, which will be issued by various businesses for self-declaration. After verifying the amount of tax to be supplemented, a stamp tax payment voucher will be issued. However, from January 21, 1946, if illegal vouchers are found again or reported, they will be immediately transferred to the court for handling and cannot be settled by supplementary payment.</p>

<h3>Mayor Qian's Report Yesterday: Right-Hand Traffic to Begin on New Year's Day; Estimated One Million Passengers</h3>
<p>(Our Newspaper's Report) Mayor Qian announced that the national policy of right-hand traffic will be implemented on New Year's Day next year. The city of Shanghai has frequent traffic and the number of vehicles and passengers is the highest in the country. Therefore, right-hand traffic requires broader publicity to facilitate its implementation. Yesterday, he specially hosted the city's press at the City Hall auditorium. Attendees included Mayor Qian, Deputy Mayor He DeKui, Secretary-General Shen Shihua, Director of Public Utilities Bureau Zhao Zengyu, Director of Police Bureau Xuan Tiewu, Director of Public Works Bureau Zhao Zukang, Deputy Commander Li, and fifty to sixty reporters from various Chinese and foreign newspapers.</p>
<p>Sounding Sirens, Correcting Time</p>
<p>Mayor Qian began by stating that in most countries around the world, vehicles drive on the right. China has historically driven on the left. Therefore, vehicles purchased from abroad often require modification of the steering wheel, which costs 12% of the vehicle's price. The total cost of modifications nationwide is substantial. Thus, saving modification costs is another reason for switching to right-hand traffic. Furthermore, during the War of Resistance, various places had air defense command centers, air defense intelligence networks, and alarms. After the war, these facilities lost their purpose. It is now proposed to use them as tools to alert citizens. The city has decided to sound sirens at exactly 12:00 noon every day, starting on New Year's Day next year, to facilitate citizens' synchronization to the standard time. As for the implementation time for right-hand traffic in the city, it was originally scheduled for 12:00 midnight on December 31st of this year. However, as that evening coincides with New Year's Eve, amidst the celebrations, it is inconvenient to make a sudden change. Therefore, it has been decided to implement it starting at 6:00 AM on New Year's Day. At 6:00 AM that day, the city will sound sirens, and all vehicles will switch to right-hand traffic.</p>
<p>Vehicle Congestion, Safety First</p>
<p>Director of Public Utilities Bureau Zhao Zengyu then reported, summarizing three points: First, a report on the city's traffic facilities, including the modification of traffic lights, platforms, and stations, and the number of modifications. Second, a report on the total number of vehicles of various types in the city and the number of passengers. According to the report, the total number of registered motorized vehicles, pedicabs, rickshaws, bicycles, etc., reaches 127,898, and the number of passengers reaches over one million. Third, given the large number of vehicles and people, the primary concern should be safety. For example, the speed limit in the city is 20 miles per hour, and outside the city, it is 30 miles per hour. Other important points include attention to traffic lights and newly painted yellow lines for sidewalks.</p>
<p>Most Accidents Occurred Last Month</p>
<p>Finally, Director of Police Bureau Xuan Tiewu reported that the city is transitioning from an old-fashioned city to a modern metropolis, resulting in a mix of old and new transportation methods. The types are complex, and the quantities are large. Furthermore, many streets do not meet standards. Even Nanjing Road is considered too narrow. Therefore, the only remedy is to widen the roads and even consider building underground trams. Director Xuan then reported on the number of traffic accidents and casualties in recent months. From September 12th, when Director Xuan took office, to the end of that month, there were 138 traffic accidents, with 90 injuries and 4 deaths. In October, there were 294 traffic accidents, with 163 injuries and 7 deaths. In November, there were 322 traffic accidents, with 219 injuries and 18 deaths. In December, there were 234 traffic accidents, with 126 injuries and 9 deaths. In total, there were 988 traffic accidents in over three months, with 598 injuries and 38 deaths. Director Xuan further stated that the eight years of war have severely damaged the city's original good traffic management, which now requires active reorganization and restoration. There were 74 traffic violations from September 12th to the end of that month, 185 in October, 174 in November, and 137 in December, totaling 570. It is reported that most traffic accidents occur on the bridges over the Suzhou Creek.</p>
<p>Uniform Display of National Flags Required</p>
<p>Furthermore, since the implementation of traffic management on Nanjing Road, the number of accidents has decreased by about 40%. It is predicted that after the switch to right-hand traffic, the number of accidents may increase due to habit. However, he will mobilize all officers to assist in directing and explaining. Director Xuan also addressed the matter of the Police Bureau producing national flags and flagpoles on behalf of citizens. He stated that this action is purely to facilitate citizens and comply with the Executive Yuan's instructions. In the future, flag displays must strictly adhere to the previously issued regulations on displaying the party and national flags. Therefore, the size, hanging method, and position of the flags must be uniform to enhance the spectacle. To facilitate citizens, the Bureau has convened meetings with blacksmith shops and flag manufacturers to handle this matter at the lowest possible price.</p>
<h3>Land Bureau Handles Land Registration; Real Estate Developers Express Opinions; Authorities Hope Owners Understand the Significance of Legislation</h3>
<p>(Our Newspaper's Report) Due to the concessions and the eight years of occupation, the ownership of land in Shanghai is confused and unclear. The Land Bureau, following the central government's intentions, is determined to rectify the situation and complete the city-wide measurement on schedule. The period for registration and submission of documents is from November 19th of this year to January 18th, 1946, with a registration fee of 0.4% levied. The deed tax is levied according to the central government's regulations, with a valuation-based collection of 6% to 15%. Mayor Qian issued a written statement on the 23rd of this month, demonstrating the importance the authorities attach to this matter. Since the start of the process, it has been over a month, but only a few have registered. The City Chamber of Commerce and major real estate developers, bank trust departments, etc., recently held a meeting to discuss this matter. Yesterday, the reporter interviewed real estate developers to solicit their opinions, which can be summarized in several points:</p>
<p>Two-Month Deadline is Too Short</p>
<p>(1) The total amount of land in Shanghai is approximately 210,000 mu, and the total number of households is approximately 300,000. The current Land Bureau has only three registration offices, each processing 200 applications per day, for a maximum of 600 applications per day. It would take one and a half years to complete the process. Setting a two-month deadline is unrealistic. (2) According to land tax regulations, the registration fee is only 0.2%, but the Land Bureau now stipulates 0.4%. The City Chamber of Commerce has submitted a request to the municipal government to forward it to the central government for a reduction. There is also no provision for a 15% deed tax in the Land Law, so a request for exemption is also being made. (3) The valuation method is based on the valuation of the puppet government in 1941, cumulatively increasing each year, reaching 200 times this year. Most real estate developers believe that the Land Bureau's experts should jointly discuss with representatives of the city's real estate developers to determine the valuation method and make it public. The valuation of the puppet government is difficult to use as a standard.</p>
<p>Stalled Transactions Affect Finance</p>
<p>(4) Real estate is Shanghai's largest asset. Financial circulation requires real estate title deeds as collateral. Registration requires a two-month public notice period, which will severely impact the city's finances. Shanghai real estate has always been commercialized, and property transfers are frequent. The imposition of a deed tax will halt transactions, causing land prices to plummet, potentially triggering a financial crisis. All the capital of real estate companies has been used to purchase real estate, and most will not be able to pay such large registration fees and deed taxes. Shanghai's land administration has always been chaotic, with various types of deeds, such as *fang dan* (field deeds), *jiao dan* (corner deeds), *dao qi* (lease deeds), and land occupation certificates. In the past, there was no comprehensive measurement. *Dao qi* were perpetual lease deeds used by foreigners, exempt from land tax, with maps and quick transfer and mortgage processes. Therefore, many Chinese put their property under the name of foreign firms to obtain *dao qi*. During the occupation, the government moved, and land was divided, with no place to handle it. Therefore, banks and trust departments implemented a trusteeship system. The Land Bureau is determined to thoroughly eliminate these two unreasonable systems, which the city's real estate developers strongly support.</p>
<p>Land Authorities Explain the Significance</p>
<p>However, according to the explanation from the responsible land registration authorities in the city's Land Bureau, the purpose of the legislation is to emphasize the connection between the owner and the land. Therefore, they earnestly hope that "every piece of land, every owner, can directly interact with the land authorities." They urge owners to understand the legislative meaning and comply with the laws and regulations. The reporter then raised several questions, which were answered separately. Regarding the land registration deadline, it was stated that, according to regulations, land not registered for its first ownership cannot be registered for rights other than ownership. Therefore, it is necessary to strive for speed in handling the first ownership registration. Within the six districts where registration has begun in the city, there are 210,000 mu of land, totaling 300,000 *qiu*. Of these, over 100,000 *qiu* had land occupation certificates issued before the war. Therefore, the remaining number was initially estimated to be completed within two months. If registration is not completed on time, special circumstances and provisions for supplementary registration applications will be considered. The submission period can actually last for four or five months, which is considered sufficient time.</p>
<p>Application Documents Can Be Returned First</p>
<p>The time spent on registration is unavoidable in the rectification process. Moreover, the original documents submitted by the owners can be returned after review, which should not cause any inconvenience. Regarding the explanation of the 0.4% registration fee, it was stated that the current registration requires a large number of personnel and extensive printing of forms, resulting in significant expenses. In the past, provinces usually levied a land measurement fee before registration. This city has not levied such a fee. The city's finances are currently facing difficulties, and the Bureau has no choice but to be self-sufficient, hence the slight increase in the registration fee. In response to requests from various sectors, a request for reduction has been submitted to the municipal government for approval, but a response has not yet been received.</p>
<p>Deed Tax Can Hopefully Be Exempted</p>
<p>As for the deed tax, the central government also has regulations for registering first and deferring tax reporting. However, the municipal government ordered the consolidation of deed tax collection, so it is being handled together. They hope that owners will register in accordance with the law first. After the registration is completed and the land tax is levied according to the law, the deed tax can hopefully be exempted. Finally, regarding the issue of land valuation, it was stated that the 1941 valuation is only a transitional measure, with an annual cumulative increase of up to 200 times, but the rate of increase is less than a quarter of the general price index increase. The official valuation work is currently underway.</p>
<h3>Repeated Acts of Violence: All Movie Theaters in the City Closed Today</h3>
<p>(Our Newspaper's Report) Recently, there have been frequent incidents in the city where individuals resembling soldiers demand free "signed tickets" at movie theaters. Upon refusal, they use violence against theater staff. There have been several incidents in various theaters this month. All movie theaters, large and small, in the city have decided to close for one day today to express sympathy for their injured colleagues. Yesterday, all the movie theaters also</p>
<p>issued a statement stating: "We are legitimate businessmen and strictly abide by national laws. Now that the War of Resistance has been won and the light of day has returned, we are all delighted to start anew and celebrate the revival of the country. Therefore, we have specially formulated preferential treatment methods for soldiers to express our respect for the war heroes who fought for the country and the people. Unexpectedly, unscrupulous individuals, impersonating soldiers, are creating trouble without reason, resorting to violence against theater staff, and escalating their actions, gathering crowds to commit acts of violence. For example, on the 23rd of this month, multiple staff members from the Lido, Great Shanghai, and Nanjing theaters were beaten and injured to varying degrees, and the theaters' assets were damaged. Details of these acts of violence</p>
<p>have been reported in the city's newspapers. In addition to petitioning the relevant authorities to effectively stop these unlawful acts and provide definite and effective protection for our service colleagues, we have collectively decided to close all theaters for one day today to express our deep sympathy for the injured colleagues. We hope that all party, government, and military authorities and people from all walks of life will show their understanding and forgiveness and uphold justice to protect human rights."</p>
<p>Another report: Yesterday at 5:00 PM, a person dressed in a yellow military uniform suddenly appeared at the Dahua Cinema on Nanjing West Road, claiming to be from a certain command's special service team. Due to insufficient military funds, he requested a loan of 400,000 legal currency. After repeated requests by the manager, Zhu Yitian, to reduce the amount, he was given 100,000 legal currency. The person in charge of the theater reported the incident to the authorities last night for the record. It is understood that military and police agencies are strictly investigating and pursuing those who impersonate military personnel and extort money, and will bring them to justice.</p>
<h3>General Manager of Textile Construction Company, Shu Yuzhang, Issues Statement: Received Textile Factories Will Soon Resume Production</h3>
<p>The China Textile Construction Company officially started operations yesterday at 138 Jiangxi Road. It is reported that the enemy and puppet textile factories received by the Economic Ministry's special envoy in Shanghai, with over 900,000 spindles and over 40,000 wool spindles, will soon be handed over to the company for management. According to Shu Yunzhang, the company's general manager, who arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, the enemy and puppet textile factories within the Shanghai area allocated to the Textile Company for management still need to be decided after discussions with the Economic Ministry's special envoy and other relevant agencies. Therefore, the quantity cannot be definitively answered at this time. However, the Textile Company will promptly resume production after taking over these enemy and puppet factories to increase production volume and ensure that the people of the country have sufficient cloth. However, there is currently a major difficulty, which is the</p>
<p>issue of power</p>
<p>Statistics show that there are over 2 million textile spindles in Shanghai, including state-owned, privately owned (including enemy and puppet factories). Based on the current state of power supply, only half can be put into operation. Therefore, the first step is to actively resolve the power issue. The second issue is the raw material supply. Regarding the raw material issue, there should not be too much difficulty because the United States will soon ship a large amount of relief supplies to China. Mr. Shu went on to talk about the company's internal organizational structure, stating that the head office has been decided to be located in Shanghai, with</p>
<p>branch offices in Tianjin and Qingdao</p>
<p>to manage the enemy and puppet textile businesses in the above two places. Yang Yizhou, manager of the Tianjin branch, and Fan Chengchuan, manager of the Qingdao branch, have already gone to establish branch offices and have already completed the takeover of the enemy and puppet textile factories in these two places before Shanghai. In addition, offices have been established in Kunming, Chongqing, Shashi, Hankou, and Xi'an. In the near future, offices will also be established in Guangzhou, Fuzhou, and other places to handle the purchase of cotton and the promotion of the company's products. In the future, branch offices or offices will be added separately depending on local conditions to</p>
<p>expand business</p>
<p>The head office has five departments under its jurisdiction: engineering, business, accounting, auditing, and secretarial. Products will be sold directly by the business department. Finally, Mr. Shu stated that the head office plans to hand over the received enemy and puppet textile factories to private management two years after they are rectified and brought back on track. Whether they will be jointly operated by the government and businesses or entirely handed over to private management will depend on the situation at that time and will be decided by the authorities.</p>
<h3>Tianbin Gold Shop Robbed Three Times</h3>
<p>(Our Newspaper's Report) Tianbao Gold Shop, located at 601 Jinling East Road, attached to the Meihua Photo Studio, was suddenly attacked by four robbers at around 11:00 AM yesterday. Two of them showed firearms and robbed more than three taels of pure gold and over two million pseudo-currency. While fleeing, the owner followed them and alerted the police, who arrested one robber. In the afternoon, three more accomplices were apprehended, and two pistols were confiscated. All were taken into custody for investigation. It is reported that the shop has been robbed three times in the past six months. The first time occurred in September. After the police arrested one robber, he was handed over to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for interrogation. He was found guilty and executed in front of the shop. Within a few months, the shop was robbed twice more.</p>
<p>At around 6:30 PM last night, two soldiers suddenly appeared at 20 Baoyu Lane, Caishi Street, and threatened with guns, robbing two gold rings. While fleeing with the stolen goods, they were encountered by the police bureau's plainclothes sharpshooter team, who arrested the two men and confiscated a pistol. They were taken to the bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Census to Be Completed by the End of February</h3>
<p>(Our Newspaper's Report) The Civil Affairs Bureau's household survey will be completed by the end of January next year. The city-wide census will also be completed by February 15th, after which national identity cards will be issued through the district offices. Foreigners will be issued residence permits, which must be applied for at the respective consulates and issued by the police bureau.</p>
<p>Regarding the processing of Baojia (households), Baojia will temporarily be reorganized into groups, with each district responsible for 20 to 70 groups, depending on the size of the tax area. Each group is planned to be divided into 30 Jia. The head of each group will be nominated by the district office on January 8th and temporarily selected by the municipal government. The committee members of each group will be hired by the municipal government.</p>

<h3>A Brief Discussion on the Future of Spoken Drama</h3>
<p>— Meng Du</p>
<p>Spoken drama seems to be quite prosperous today. I don't want to discuss the history of spoken drama movement in the past few decades in detail here. This topic is too big for me to solve in a short time; let those who are more capable of this work undertake it. I only hope to briefly explain a few conclusions I have drawn from my current observations of spoken drama, and incidentally, also bring up a little of my hope.</p>
<p>Spoken drama is not native to our country. How will it grow in China, and what will its future be? We know that the cultural changes of every nation and country have their social reasons. The arrival of spoken drama is also like this. The earliest spoken drama was introduced from Japan. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, students studying in Japan launched theatrical performances to exclude the Manchu Qing Dynasty and promote national ideas. These old predecessors imitated the Japanese "Shishi Drama," a form of drama since the Meiji Restoration, "Ronin Shibai." At that time, most of the plays performed were naturally anti-Manchu, but there were also a small number of foreign plays. After the Republic of China, several new drama groups with a more serious style were dissipated due to personnel changes. The remaining new drama groups also gradually deteriorated and declined due to the lack of good leadership and blindly adapting to the commercial environment, and finally degenerated into the "civilized drama troupes" of amusement parks. Later, when the New Culture Movement rose, spoken drama also raised its head again and became the darling of the era of young students. At that time, some gentlemen who had returned from abroad to study drama gradually announced some foreign spoken drama situations. Thus, due to its own needs and external influences, many "Amateur" drama groups appeared in several major cities, such as Peiping and Shanghai, and enthusiastically researched and performed spoken drama. The repertoire included masterpieces by Ibsen, Maeterlinck, Rostand, Wilde, and Shaw. This period can be said to be the heyday of amateur drama. On the eve of the Anti-Japanese War, spoken drama seemed to have returned to the enthusiasm and vigor of the "Spring Willow Society" era at the end of the Qing Dynasty. Thousands of anti-Japanese plays were staged simultaneously across the country to promote hatred of the enemy and righteous revenge. Then came the eight-year long War of Resistance, and spoken drama also accompanied the hard struggle for eight years. Therefore, I conclude that the future of spoken drama should still be in line with the changes in the entire cultural movement, and at the same time, it cannot exist independently of the social environment. In other words, it must be as suitable as possible to China's current national conditions, coordinate and unite with the vast audience as much as possible, and make it able to adapt to the environment here and take root deeply in the soil of our country.</p>
<p>Secondly, I would like to talk about several difficult problems of spoken drama. Currently, the most troublesome thing in Shanghai is the lack of theaters. During the period of the occupation, because British and American films were banned, many movie theaters had a surplus and were converted to perform spoken drama. At most, there were eight or nine theaters performing spoken drama at the same time, which also shows the abnormal prosperity of Shanghai at that time. The nouveau riche merchants needed spoken drama, which was no worse than other entertainment. However, shortly after the victory, foreign films were able to continue to be screened, and many theaters that had previously converted to perform spoken drama successively started showing movies. Theater owners naturally like to make money, and foreign films have an overwhelming advantage over spoken drama, so the previous eight or nine spoken drama theaters suddenly became three, and the abnormal prosperity suddenly became an insignificant recession—however, the roots have sprouted from the soil, and no matter how the outside world suppresses and hinders them, they will still grow tortuously under the big stones. Spoken drama is not only in Shanghai, but has also sown seeds in the remote areas of China and sprouted new branches. It cannot be prevented from developing and thriving by being manipulated and ravaged by merchants alone. Even in times of extreme theater difficulties, we can still realize a "small theater movement," as France and the United States have advocated, to continue our theatrical performances!</p>
<p>Therefore, with a more optimistic view, the lack of theaters is indeed a difficulty, but it is definitely not a fatal blow to spoken drama. What is worth studying is probably still the issue of the audience. That is, the problem of art and business. According to a speech by an old dramatist, the Peking opera audience in Beijing in the era of Boss Tan was multifaceted, with various life experiences, enthusiastic, and lively, that is, many mule drivers and sedan car drivers standing behind the small pond in the teahouse; that situation reminded the old man of the theaters in Shakespeare's time in the sixteenth century, which were also often crowded with many common people who did not pay. Then the key seems to be how to create the ability and leisure for everyone to watch dramas, how to make the performed dramas universally accepted and beneficial to the audience, and how to create theatrical performances that are enthusiastically welcomed by the audience and have artistic value? This should be an important topic that theater managers, stage supervisors, directors, playwrights, actors, stage technicians, and other people engaged in drama and those who care about drama often face.</p>
<p>Here I also thought of several construction tasks of spoken drama, which should be completed as soon as possible. Since spoken drama comes from the West, our understanding of Western acting, even modern drama, is still half-baked and clueless. We can no longer procrastinate and delay, we must encourage people who can translate to introduce famous Western plays as soon as possible in a planned way, from the well-known to the unknown, from the modern to the ancient, one writer, one nation, and one school at a time; at the same time, we must select plays that represent writers, nations, or trends of the times, and perform them faithfully and rigorously, so that our country's acting can complete hundreds of years of Western spoken drama in three or five years. In the process of this work, naturally, the cultivation of writing, directing, acting, and stage technology can be universally improved and deeply studied. Of course, drama groups can set up training classes to train actors, and the establishment of drama schools and drama research associations can also create a large number of excellent technical talents. Coupled with the artistic competition and mutual supervision of amateur drama and professional drama, its influence is enough to form an academic atmosphere. The confluence of these factors may enable Chinese spoken drama to embark on a new track of theatrical movement and move forward rapidly!</p>
<p>What path should Chinese spoken drama take?</p>
<p>I have already said some humble opinions in the above, and it seems that readers can still easily get some news from it. But if I am forced to draw a general conclusion, then I think it is also very simple, that is:</p>
<p>The current trend of world theater is from "art theater" to "people's theater"; our country's acting is relatively backward, so we must complete two tasks at once.——This is the principle. As for the specific guidelines, it is nothing more than the following two points: 1. Introduce famous plays from the world. 2. Create Chinese acting.</p>
<h3>Introducing "Return My Homeland"</h3>
<p>— Zhu Xian</p>
<p>Produced by China Film Studio, Written and Directed by Shi Dongshan</p>
<p>The story of "Return My Homeland" unfolds in a small town in North China. The ancient city walls and courtyard-style houses gradually lead to a group of honest and simple people. They finally awakened from the enemy and puppet's cunning schemes to "promote the puppet regime" and erupted into a fiery resistance.</p>
<p>At the beginning, it introduces Pingyang City under the occupation of the enemy and puppet regime. The deserted streets and the heavily guarded city gates with grim guards form a clear contrast. Then, Shenwei, the insidious captain of the enemy guard team, issued instructions to prosper the market. The attitude of the enemy soldiers towards the people suddenly changed so righteously and kindly, and batches of looted goods were given to the residents of the city, adding smiles to the faces of the honest people.</p>
<p>The puppet county magistrate is also desperately recruiting gentry who are hiding in the countryside. At this time, Wang Xiangting appears—a local wealthy man, a strong-willed old man. He has a large amount of property in the city, and also a son, Wang Daoyuan, who is deeply aware of righteousness and is engaged in salvation work. There is a conflict of opinions between father and son on the matter of "returning to the city." The old man finally returns to the city regardless of everything and accepts the position of president of the puppet chamber of commerce. Daoyuan listens to the advice of his friends: "Return to the city meaningfully."</p>
<p>The streets of Pingyang City, which have been deserted for a long time, show a prosperous scene. Crowds of people bustling in the streets come and go under the banners of Sun Beer, opium dens, and casinos, as well as shops full of enemy goods. Under this colorful surface, many sad stories have occurred: Ronin forcibly "buying" shops; a father interfering with his unproductive son in an opium den and being sent to prison, as well as heavy and complicated strange taxes...</p>
<p>Wang Xiangting negotiated with Shenwei on behalf of the business community, but instead was rebuffed. In a situation where the law only protects the Japanese, a small businessman, Chen, died. The sobbing of orphans and widows struck the strong heartstrings of this old man.</p>
<p>At midnight, the sound of gunshots coming from afar outside the city suggests a way out to the suffering people who are awakened from their dreams. Everyone is pregnant with a word that they dare not say. Wang Xiangting also deeply repents and asks Daoyuan to inform the national army outside the city.</p>
<p>Liaison personnel who had sneaked in from outside the city appeared in the city. The enemy searched the entire city, but Tang Jinglun—the worker sent from outside the city to be responsible for the contact—finally received the help of the vast people and the puppet police who had not forgotten their motherland, and did not fall into the hands of the enemy. From this, a large-scale underground activity was launched in the city. The people organized themselves, secretly learned to use the guns and weapons that were transported in, and also launched a donation movement. The envoy disguised himself as a hawker, carrying cloth with banknotes, as well as the people's yearning and hope for the motherland, and went out of the city again. The people in the city were listening quietly to his gradually fading drum sounds.</p>
<p>The lights in the theater suddenly came on, and I woke up as if from a dream. Yes, I relived this eight-year nightmare again, and my heart was so heavy! Now it's over!</p>
<p>In the whole film, there are no sensational big scenes, no exaggerated stimulation, and no excessive rendering, but it deeply grasps the inner transformation of the characters and shows the growth of the people's power. It looks like a lyrical little poem. Shi Dongshan's techniques are always good, and the sound and light are excellent. Among the actors, Qian Qianli is the most successful, portraying a simple and lovely old farmer. Zhang Zhen and Zong You are conscientious, but Tao Jin's Wang Xiangting feels a little too energetic.</p>
<h3>Ouyang Hongying in Chongqing</h3>
<p>— Mei Youyun</p>
<p>—Participating in the performance of the New China Drama Society, "Night Tide on the Bund of Shanghai"—</p>
<p>"I am acting, and I am also experiencing life! You have made me taste all kinds of sweet, sour, bitter, and spicy flavors, and you have made me experience the moods of people in various classes!"</p>
<p>Ouyang Hongying wrote such sentences for participating in "Night Tide on the Bund of Shanghai." This red star of the Shanghai drama scene ten years ago has been constantly working hard for drama and seeking to enrich her life.</p>
<p>"Night Tide on the Bund of Shanghai" is a story about the Feng Kuanglin family, who has a high status in Shanghai. He is an upright and patriotic old man. His second son, Zhenxiong, and third daughter, Shuguo, are also patriotic youths, but unfortunately, his eldest son, Shaotang, and eldest daughter-in-law, Huang Siying, are a pair of cowardly, profit-seeking guys. Shaotang uses his father's position to serve as the chief of the special service department of the Japanese gendarmerie and the director of the rice, coal, and cotton yarn control bureau under the Japanese, and is a traitor who oppresses the people, kills compatriots, and commits all kinds of evils. Wei Qingxuan, Shaotang's cousin, also helps the evildoers. Aunt Wei, who works in the Feng family, has a mad son, Dabao, who is an idiot, but knows how to love the country. Zhenxiong was detained by Shaotang because he secretly helped patriotic people blow up the enemy and puppet rice warehouses shortly after returning from the mainland. Kuanglin died of anger because of this. Soon, Shaotang lost power, and the couple were killed by the Japanese. His cousin then took over his position and came to seal up his property under the order of the Japanese. At this time, the news of victory came, and when Qingxuan was about to transform himself and claim to have turned against the enemy, he was inexplicably killed by the madman Dabao leading the crowd.</p>
<p>Hongying plays Huang Siying, which is a very important role, but she plays it very well. Han plays Shaotang, Zongshan plays Kuanglin, Xiatian plays the cousin, and Huang Yuansu plays Shuguo, which adds a lot of color to the script. Xie Tian wrote this script targeting the mistakes of those who want to think that traitors have contributed to the country, and the meaning is very correct. However, there are many rigid and far-fetched places, especially his interweaving of the madman Dabao's role, and at the same time, he gave him a Dabao leading the crowd to kill the traitors at the end, which destroyed the glory of the whole play, and it cannot but be considered a major shortcoming of this script! The scene between Dabao and Doctor Mei is even more meaningless! However, a person who is learning to write a script for the first time can have such achievements, as long as he can continue to learn, he has a bright future!</p>
<p>"Night Tide on the Bund of Shanghai" can cause a sensation in the mountain city and win a lot of praise, mostly because of the efforts of the director, Shen Pangzi, and the neat lineup of actors. Hongying's hard work is also a major reason! December 12th and 13th, in Chongqing</p>
<h3>Chongqing Personnel</h3>
<p>It is said that Qin Yi, a female star from the China Film Studio, will marry Shen Chongjiao, a former member of the "Fudan Drama Society" and a famous basketball player, after leaving Chen Tianguo two years ago.

<h3>News from the Ancient Capital's Theaters</h3>
<h3>The Chairman Watches Old Dramas in Peiping</h3>
<p>— Li Mu</p>
<p>The situation of the theater industry after the victory seems to be more satisfactory than other industries. Good spoken drama scripts that could not be performed under the enemy and puppet regime can now be performed. Peking opera has also swept away the previous vulgar atmosphere of cotton spinning by theater fans and is gradually moving towards regularization. In Shanghai, Dr. Mei Lanfang, who had retired for eight years and was not used by the enemy and puppet regime, took the lead in performing Kunqu opera to celebrate the victory, and performed commercial dramas for ten days. Although the ticket prices were high, the venue was full every night. It is expected that he will soon resume performing excellent Peking opera dramas.</p>
<p>Peiping is the birthplace of Peking opera, but in the past few years, under the ravages of the enemy and puppet regime, the theatrical style has been greatly corrupted. A certain female actor attempted suicide after being criticized by upright people in the society after the victory, which is not worth a laugh from those in the know. Cheng Yanqiu, one of the four famous female actors, also hid as an old farmer because he could not bear the lewd power of the traitors. Meng Xiaodong, the queen of female actors, has always refused to perform on stage.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang recently went to Peiping and invited famous actors to perform excellent dramas in Huai Ren Hall to entertain foreign guests. On that evening, famous actors such as Cheng Yanqiu, Meng Xiaodong, Li Shifang, Tan Dangying, and Ma Lianliang all took the stage, and the grand occasion was unprecedented in many years. The author recently received a letter from the young female actor Li Shifang, which is described in detail. The following is an excerpt from it: "...I am now performing once every four days to comfort the US military under the agreement of the War Zone Service Corps. The play is Zhen'e Assassinates the Tiger. It has been performed eight times and will continue in the future. Last Tuesday, the Peiping chief entertained General Wyatt, the representative of the British Prime Minister, and the wife of the British Ambassador to China, and invited me to perform The Assassin in the Bankers Association. Last night, I had a commercial play for the first time to sing The Daughter of Heaven, but because Chairman Chiang visited Peiping to perform in Huai Ren Hall to welcome him, my commercial play was suspended. The welcome plays included (1) Tan Fuying's Losing Jieting, (2) Meng Xiaodong and Li Shifang's Wujiapo, (3) Cheng Yanqiu's Hongfu Biography, (4) Ma Lianliang and Li Wanchun's Eight Hammers. The scene was unprecedented. The Chairman and his wife arrived at the same time, as well as many chiefs and hundreds of allied troops. After the performance of Wujiapo, Meng Xiaodong and I went to see the Chairman, he was very kind, and stood up to shake hands and thank us. He also introduced us to the allied military chiefs, so although my hospital returned to the humble house last night, I was so happy to get such a glorious harvest..." From this letter, we know that Li Shifang, Dr. Mei's proud disciple, is also busy in Peiping "assassinating tigers" to comfort the US military. The two masters and apprentices can be called a brilliant example of the north and south, and it is also a good story in the current Peking opera scene.</p>
<h3>"Seagull"</h3>
<p>— Li Qinglai</p>
<p>The female writer Shi Jimei and Yu Zhaoming, Fu Xiaofeng, and others have recently organized a completely amateur "Seagull" theater group, which has been filed with the Municipal Party Committee and the Social Bureau. They are currently rushing to rehearse Chen Quan's "Wild Rose" and preparing to perform it in the new year. The director is Feng Zhe, and the actors include Zhang Minyu and Li Qinglai. It is said that Li returned from Chongqing and performed "Metamorphosis," "Tiger Tally," and "Resurrection" in Chongqing, which won a lot of praise from the audience. This time, he and Zhang will take on the role of Xia Huai in "Wild Rose" in an AB system.</p>
<h3>"Donation" and "Entertainment"</h3>
<p>— Jiang Shang'ou</p>
<p>In Chongqing, in order to meet wartime needs, in addition to levying a 50% entertainment tax on the ticket prices of entertainment venues, there are also various charitable acts, with additional donations of several tens of percent, etc. In short, a movie ticket, in addition to its own value, also requires 100% of various taxes. Now this practice has been blown to the recovered areas. Recently, the municipal authorities of Nanjing have received orders to levy an additional 40% entertainment tax on all entertainment venues, followed by a continuation of the 40% winter relief donation (there is no doubt that this donation will benefit the poor in the recovered areas). Let's imagine, the "spring relief" and "summer relief" that are waiting for the opportunity will not be difficult to follow. After finishing the writing without a title, it should be said that this is to meet the needs of the recovery.</p>
<p>It is said that this "winter relief donation" will be levied from today and will continue to be levied until March next year—that time is the season of spring and warm flowers! At least the poor who need "winter relief" are not eligible to receive relief in the last period of collection, because it is already spring at that time, so wouldn't it be necessary to respond to the aforementioned need for "spring relief."</p>
<p>Poor old people in winter should receive relief, but relief must be distributed as soon as possible, so that the poor people will benefit greatly; if the money from "donations" is distributed in order, it will become a state of "dragging." To be frank, these seasonal "donations" should be planned and budgeted. Rather than being assigned to everyone who wants to get "spiritual food" (and not called "seeking entertainment"), it is better for the owners of each entertainment venue or the theatrical brokers and film agents to bear a reasonable burden.</p>
<p>Speaking of the naming of the "entertainment tax," there was also a period of struggle, that is, in Chengdu in the rear. The municipal authorities set the "behavior ban tax," and watching movies and listening to Peking opera were all examples of "behavior bans," and taxes should be paid, and its meaning was the same as the need to ban bad behaviors such as visiting brothels and smoking opium. So a gust of wind rose, and public opinion questioned each other. After negotiations with relevant parties, the name was changed to "entertainment tax." The storm of "entertainment tax" was not small.</p>
<p>Do you want to seek entertainment? Please pay the "donation" according to the regulations. "Donation" and "entertainment" are inseparable. Of course, it is an "obligation that should be fulfilled" to "donate happily" in order to obtain entertainment.</p>
<h3>The More You Watch, the More Disappointing It Becomes – The Decline of Yue Opera</h3>
<p>— Old Fool</p>
<p>In the past five years, I have seen no less than twenty kinds of local operas from various places. I find that Yue Opera (not the "笃班" [a type of female Yue Opera] disguised as such) has the strictest rules. Take the character Bao Zheng in the opera, for example. In other local operas, he is played by a Jing (painted-face) role, but in Yue Opera, he is played by a Laosheng (old male) role. Bao Zheng is an upright and selfless person, firm but not rough, heroic but with attention to detail. In terms of personality, it is more reasonable to have a Laosheng play him than a Jing role. In Yue Opera, Zhao Kuangyin is indeed played by a Laosheng, but in the play "Gaoping Pass," a Jing role is assigned because Zhao Kuangyin in "Gaoping Pass" is ill-intentioned and cunning, so a Laosheng cannot play him. This shows that Yue Opera's rules are stricter than those of any other local opera. I remember more than ten years ago, when Yue Opera was performed at the Zhabei Grand Theater, the theater authorities, being natives of Yue, specially invited the local leader Mr. Wang Xiaolai to write an inscription. Mr. Wang wrote the four characters "越看越好" (the more you watch, the better it gets). These four characters can be interpreted as people from Shaoxing watching Shaoxing opera and finding it good. At the same time, the character "越" (yue) can be interpreted as "愈" (yu), meaning "the more." Thus, it becomes "the more you watch, the better it gets." Indeed, the organization of Yue Opera is not as simple as Shanghai's Yueju, Hankou's Chu Opera, Henan's Da Bangzi, or Tangshan's Bengbeng. Even when placed among Han Opera, Hui Opera, Sichuan Opera, and Qin Opera, it is not inferior. Plays like "Mat Shed Meeting" (i.e., "Zhu Hen Ji"), "Baolian Lantern," and "San Tongguan" (i.e., "Zhan Jing Tang") are all more outstanding than Peking Opera. However, Yue Opera needs to be watched more to see its good qualities. This is probably what Mr. Wang Xiaolai meant by "the more you watch, the better it gets!"</p>
<p>Alas! Today, Yue Opera is overshadowed by the "improved 笃班" (female Yue Opera) labeled as Yue Opera, and it is in a state of decline. Because Yue people are willing to spend millions to run "improved 笃班" (female Yue Opera) but are unwilling to spend hundreds of thousands to form a Luantan troupe (i.e., Yue Opera). One is buying beauty, and the other is selling art. Naturally, beauty is more easily appealing. Yue Opera has become "越看越難看" (the more you watch, the more disappointing it becomes) in the eyes of most Yue people, and its decline is no wonder.</p>

<h3>John Steinbeck's New Work on the Screen</h3>
<p>— Toyoshiba Hara</p>
<p>Among modern American writers, we should know John Steinbeck. His famous work "The Grapes of Wrath" raised a serious issue in American society, saying what others dared not say, and his writing style is sharp and incisive, without the affectation of ordinary self-proclaimed proletarian writers. "The Grapes of Wrath" and his other famous work, "Of Mice and Men," were both adapted into films in 1941, receiving good reviews.</p>
<p>Another book, "Sundown," is an anti-Nazi novel, also made into a film by United Artists, starring Gene Tierney, George Sanders, and Bruce Cabot from "Citizen Kane." This film has received excellent reviews internationally and has already been screened in the mainland.</p>
<p>This summer, Paramount Pictures specially invited him and Jack Wagner to collaborate on a novel suitable for the screen, called "A Medal for Benny." Frank Butler, the famous screenwriter who won an award for "Going My Way" last year, was invited to adapt it into a screenplay. The male and female leads are Dorothy Lamour and French star Arturo de Cordova, while J. Carrol Naish plays an elderly role in the film, with excellent acting skills.</p>
<p>The director of this film, Irving Pichel, has previously created works such as "The New World" (starring Paul Muni) and "The Most Dangerous Game," as far as I know.</p>
<p>Each of Steinbeck's works always provides a clear theme, and this film should be no exception.</p>

<h3>The Distress of Lost Mail – Hoping the Postal Authorities Will Pay Attention</h3>
<p>A letter from Mr. Zhu Qilv, a reader of this newspaper, states: "Mr. Editor: I am extremely eager to have you disclose this letter. This is a kind of trouble that I am personally suffering from. Putting myself in others' shoes, I believe everyone feels the same. In the dark era before victory, although this was a common phenomenon, I disdained and was unwilling to cry out! But now, under the care of our own officials, I must appeal, and that is for the loss of letters in the mail. The fact is this: I have two friends, A and B, in Hangzhou. Twenty days ago, when I separated from them and returned to Shanghai, I had a small disagreement with A. A subsequently sent a letter to Shanghai to explain to me, but it was lost. B sent me a letter, and I immediately replied to him, but it was also lost (around November 9th to 14th). A is anxious as to why I would misunderstand him? B misunderstands why I am ignoring him, and I am emotionally waiting for their letters. Thus, all three of us have been played by Hong Qiao (a historical figure famous for losing letters) and have fallen into a net of anxiety and pity. I can no longer be quiet for a moment. I imagined many bad possibilities, and my heart would ache. After fifteen days of torment, A's second letter finally arrived. He still thought I had not calmed down! And B, because I asked someone to bring him a letter, also sent a quick letter. Everything was cleared up, but we were all disappointed by it. B wanted to argue with the post office. I said don't bother, let's ask the postal authorities to make improvements. I also ask you, sir, to assist us and not throw this request letter in the wastebasket! Respectfully wishing you peace."</p>
<h3>Service Briefs</h3>
<p>Visiting Mr. Feng Mingquan: Mr. Feng lectured on Mandarin Chinese at the Shen Bao before the war and had a good reputation. During the Anti-Japanese War, there was no news of him. His son, Yifei, is the former principal of Zhabei Shanghai North Middle School. Because a letter was brought from the mainland but could not be delivered, please inform Jiao Zikang of Dachangxiang Silk Shop at 397 Nanjing Road if you know the current address of his father and son.</p>
<p>Li Yuanbei's Brother Xiangzhou: Since Brother Pangen moved west with the National Army in the winter of 1937, he first sent a letter from Chenzhuang Post Office in Hebei in 1940. It has been five years, and there has been no news. If any relatives or friends know his contact address, please send a letter to the Shanghai Society Restoration Preparatory Office at 180 Jinling Road, Shanghai, or to Commander Wu of the Artillery Regiment of the Third Army in Hongkou.</p>
<p>Seeking Liang Xueqin: Liang Xueqin went to the mainland from Zhenjiang after the war. He married Miss Sheng Jianying of Suzhou in Fancheng, Hubei, last year and sent a letter. I do not know where he is now? If you have any information, I would be grateful. (Liang Gongnuo of 3 Quanyi Lane, Changping Road, Shanghai)</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou Jianzhong: Your brother, Jianjun, came to Shanghai and got lost. He is now temporarily residing in the Children's Shelter of the First Section of the Administrative Office of the Police Headquarters. Please come and take him back as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>A Carefree Discussion on Quitting Smoking (5)</h3>
<p>— Hu Qi</p>
<p>6.  Maintaining Health During Smoking Cessation</p>
<p>Patients during the period of smoking cessation should gradually eliminate all abnormal lifestyle habits that existed while smoking, such as irregular eating, staying up all night, and getting up at dusk, all of which are harmful to the body's health. Therefore, during the process of smoking cessation, one should pay special attention to maintaining mental health, abstaining from sexual activity, and exercising appropriately at regular times, but avoid overexertion to prevent other obstacles from occurring.</p>
<p>7.  Post-Cessation Attention and Relapse</p>
<p>Once the smoking addiction has been quit, those with weak bodies should continue to recuperate in order to recover as soon as possible. Occasionally, there may be uncomfortable symptoms such as withdrawal phenomena after quitting. Do not be suspicious or afraid, thinking it is a relapse. In fact, the so-called relapse is entirely psychological. It should be known that ordinary people often experience pain, yawning, depression, insomnia, etc. when the dog days are abnormal or when the body is fatigued. Why is it that when someone who has smoked before suffers from it, it is called relapse? If you feel very uncomfortable or if an old illness recurs, you should seek medical treatment and not try to use tobacco again, otherwise, it will be easier to become addicted than the first time.</p>
<p>8.  Conclusion</p>
<p>Based on my clinical experience of more than ten years, I dare to represent all doctors with smoking cessation experience and advise those who are suffering from tobacco addiction: "There are very few examples of smoking addictions that cannot be quit." Now that the Anti-Japanese War has been won, the laws prohibiting smoking have been promulgated. I sincerely hope that smokers will have firm faith and determination to quit smoking as soon as possible to free themselves from a lifelong shackle, eliminate tobacco addiction, and wash away a great national shame. This is what I silently pray for. (The End)</p>
