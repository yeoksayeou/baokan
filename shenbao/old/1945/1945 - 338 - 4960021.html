<h3>韓國山川風土</h3>
<p>〔聯合社漢城十日電〕韓國又名朝鮮，顧名思義，當爲富有淸新朝氣之地。但四千三百年來，迄無寗日。戰爭叛變陰謀，層出不窮，故外人有稱之爲「東方愛爾蘭」者。韓人身材較日人爲高，皮色亦較白皙，日本工人頗仇視之，大約因韓人刻苦耐勞，雖食不果腹，亦能操作逾人，可與中國農夫媲美，而遠非日人所及。韓國田地百分之七十五，係由佃農耕作，在日本統治下，每年每人平均僅得米二蒲希爾。韓人與日人不同，喜食肉，但咸視屠宰爲低微之職業。學者地位最高，蓋深染中國「萬般皆下品，惟有讀書高」之傳統思想。韓人神話自稱係天神子孫，相傳有一古神憫念世間人類，親蒞下界，於水畔見一貞女，吹以仙氣有娠，遂生韓人始祖。韓人宗敎，係混合原始崇拜，佛敎與儒學而成，但近年受歐美影響，信奉基督敎者日多。韓國人口約二千三百萬人，基督徒約五十萬人，其中廿八萬七千人屬長老會，十一萬五千人屬天主敎。韓人喜戴美國式帽，御西服者且較東京市上所見者爲多。韓人舊習，無論男女皆衣白衣。據傳此風起於數百年前，當局因遭王喪，守制三年，人民一律御白。詎知嗣位之王，均不久於位，接連而薨者三人，遂以喪服爲常服。但今日受外國影響，此習已漸廢。聞日人獨恨白衣，輒喜濺　韓人衣上，强令染色。韓人則視日人爲文化暴發戶，蓋日本之輸入中國文化，最初係間接由韓國傳去。日人不義，竟忘其本。活字印刷術在歐洲發明前五十年，即由中國傳入韓國，其開化之早可知。一五九二年，嘗以鐵甲船與日本艦隊戰而殲滅之，早於美國潘萊之砲擊日本三百年。日人所出版之遊覽指南，稱韓國靑年人人得享受現代敎育，然按諸實際，入學校者僅佔百分之十八。日人在本國，則確有百分之九十九，强受普通敎育。日人治韓之眞正方針，可由某一總督之言見之：「韓人可由之不可使知之」。韓人之眞正敎育，大多係外國傳敎士所創辦經營，故日人恨之切骨。韓人住屋大多爲泥牆平屋，屋頂蓋草或瓦，地用石板，上舖席或油紙，爐灶烟囪在石板下盤過，藉以取暖，法至巧妙。韓國國境爲一半島，但其地多山，僅總面積之百分之二十五爲可耕地，以稻爲主要農產，曩在日人統治下，每年收成爲日人取去者達三分之一。地土既瘠，以人糞充肥料，故食其鮮菜，有罹痢疾及傷寒之危險。韓人家庭，以丈母爲主人，亦一奇俗，通常男子爲一家之主，其婦司內，但一旦其子娶媳，則由媳任操作，而親家　　母隨之俱來，喧賓奪主，儼然爲全家之統治者矣。</p>

<h3>專論　收復區企業資本與所提稅問題</h3>
<p>— 汪治</p>
<p>資本云者，乃指企業之全部資產，减去全部負債後之純財產額之謂也。當企業開始，資本旋即運用，財產既隨之增减變化，盈虧遂爲必然之後果，故原始之　出資本，僅足以代表股東投資之數額，及持有之股份數，而不能代表該企業之純財產額，至爲明顯。惜吾國現行所得稅制度所採標準，資本僅指實在繳足之股金或實際投入之本金而言，有公積金者，僅許以三分之一併入資本計算，且按純益對資本額之比例，以規定其稅率。用全額累進制爲原則，則資本額之決定與納稅額之多寡，關係至鉅。</p>
<p>抗戰以來，通貨膨賬，幣値貶價，一般工商業若以金額計算，無不有巨額盈餘。此類盈餘，因營利所得者固有之，但大部份係由幣値貶價所致。而收復區商人，前於敵僞盤據之時，欲保全原有財產，又不甘多所捐納，遂紛紛設法逃稅，因此隱蔽於公積者有之，隱藏於存貨者有之，甚或虛搆帳冊，極力隱蔽，而商業道德亦隨之墮落無遺。今抗戰勝利，中央政府正欲鼓勵生產，獎進投資，則不妨乘商家欲重行調整資本額而苦拘於稅制之際，將民國三十四年度甲乙兩項營利事業所得稅之　徵方法，暫行修正而達於踝稅不損及原本之原則，庶幾工商界疊昔之隱藏虛偽，得隨河山而重光。茲就管見所及，擬具企業資本調整辦法，以供課微營利事業所得稅之參考。深望明達之土，有以敎正焉。</p>
<p>（一）資本之調整，當視各企業實情而定。—企業資本之情形，各有不同，有原係法幣舉位，至民國三十一年六月以二對一折合偽幣者；有原係法幣單位折成偽幣後，復經僞幣增資者；有新企業自始即以僞幣爲單位者，情形不一。今若以第一種企業之帳面僞幣數額以二百對一換合法幣，則戰前之百萬巨業，今資本僅二千五百元。因此，碩大之財產，將均被指爲盈餘，而課以所得稅，未免太失公允，徒使將來投資者裹足不前，豈政府獎勵企業之本旨？竊以爲各企業之設立時期既有不同，當時之幣値亦各有異，其經營之得失又各有軒輊，故資本之調整，當視各企業之實際情形，酌量決定，似不必以二百對一爲準繩也。關於此點，政府本無明文規定企業資本須以二百對一換合法幣，而本年八月間何總司令佈告中列有私人債權債務，准其自行淸理等語，故余之資本調整辦法，於法並無抵觸。惟望從此調整資本額之後，再無處構隱蔽之情事，而前之隱蔽資產，重行入帳，自此以後，政府以法治爲軌範，商民當以誠實爲上策也。</p>
<p>（一）資本收益，勞方無應得之理。—或謂調整資本有賴於資本收益之撥充，而此項資本收益，對內或將引起勞資糾紛。竊以爲凡因幣値貶價，財產升値而生之收益，乃係資本收益。譬如民國二十六年原有房屋一幢，價値一萬元，今已値二百萬元，此一百九十九萬元之差額，即係資本收益，並非經營買賣所穫，勞方似無應得之理。</p>
<p>（三）資本收益之計算方法。—中國對於物價統計，向無準確之指數；然計算各企業本身之資本收益，竊以爲祗須以該企業本身所經營之主要業務有關之財產作標準，業務範圍以外之物價指數，一時固不易得，且亦不需求得。蓋股東之所以投資於該企業者，必認爲該項企業有投資之價値而發生興趣，本不當求業外之意外收入。即政府亦不允許商家經營業外業務，故於新公司法第二十二條規定「公司不得經營其登記範圍以外之業務。」由是觀之，欲求資本之收益，可以一企業收足股本時之股本額，减去所付開辦費後之餘額，再以當時該企業所必需之固定資產及主要原料與貨品之價格指數爲基數，再以同樣財產之現價指數，求得百分數，以此百分數乘上述之餘額，减原資本額，即得該企業之資本收益。其方程式爲：</p>
<p>A＝資本額；B＝開辦費；C＝現在物價指數對收足股本是物價指數之百分數；D＝資本收益。</p>
<p>〔（A－B）×C％〕－A＝D</p>
<p>例如某織造廠於民國二十六年成立，其資本爲寸萬元，當時用去必需之開辦費三萬元，其餘額七萬元，今似定其應完全投資於紡織業所必需之固定設備及棉紗，顏料，煤斤等。而該顚財產物價指數比例爲百分之三萬，則以前列方程式代入，求得其資本收益爲二千零九十萬元。或有企業中途已數次增資，則當根據每次股款繳足時，就其增賽部分，分別階段，以上述方法計算之，其總和即爲該企桀自始至今之資本收益。此種計算方法，若欲求其精密，則於導求物價指數時，當選擇重要之財產，列入統計材料，並根據實際情形每一財產對總資本所應佔之比例，合併計算，則所得指數之百分數，當可更較準確。材料選擇不愼，計算即不可靠，如銀錢業可以利率，有價證券及外匯等列入；銀餞業若以棉紗，煤斤等列入，即失去其準確性矣。</p>
<p>（四）財產升値過高之流弊。—若以全部資本收益，轉入資本，亦不免流弊叢生。今抗戰結束，交通恢復，百業復興，物價下洛，幣値不難逐漸恢復。今若將因幣値貶價所產生之資本收益，完全充作資本，將來幣値升價，勢必發生虧損，非穩固企業之道也。且財產升値過高，結出過分之盈餘，設有少數股東，不願繼續投資，則可主張權利，要求於該盈餘項下，派給現金，蓋領取紅利權，支取贈與金權等，乃私益權；與投票，選舉等之公益權有異，於法不能强制執行也。又升値過高，將來幣値恢復時，勢必發生虧損，則勞方與國稅均將蒙受損失，非處理會計之所當，我不取焉。由是觀之，財產升値之標準，以中庸穩健之道尙焉。</p>
<p>因此，民國三十四年之所得稅，希望加以修正，改以各企業調整後之資本額爲標準，從而計算所得額對於此項調整資本額之比率，以確定應課徵之稅率，同時對於由資本收益轉入資本之部份，免予微稅。並採用簡化稽微辦法。—英美所採所得稅率固亦甚高，然中國幣値貶價程度，與英美迥異。美國平均物價，以民國二十八年爲基數，今僅增加百分之二十八。英國以同年爲基數，亦僅增加百分之三十。故英美之所得晚，仍不損及企業之原本。設吾國政府，根據現行稅率，嚴格執行，則以上例所舉戰前之百萬元資本額，以一般人想像之折合而爲二千五百元，如欲恢復戰前之資本額，則九十九萬七千五百元之彌補額中，須納十九萬九千五百元之所得稅，其他因財產升値而生之資本收益，若亦被視爲普通盈餘，則所得稅一項已將企業之大部份財產爲政府所收有，此猶竭澤而漁也。今政府一再申言，欲振興實業，獎勵人民投資，可知其決非採取俄國於一九一七年布爾　維克革命成功後利用租稅制度以沒收私人資本之手段也。余深盼賢明富局體恤商艱，凡企業以資本收益轉人資本者，一概免稅，對三十四年之所得稅課微方法，暫行修改；庶幾中國幼稚之企業，于八年兵　之餘，得以稍蘇積困，而政府亦以立法宜寬，執法宜嚴之爲得也。</p>

<h3>士兵强姦不遂　利斧砍斃二人　滬東淞滬路大血案</h3>
<p>〔本報專訪〕滬東淞滬路前運動塲舊址，爲軍政部接收倉庫之一，突於十日晨發生一慘絕人寰之大血案。起因於士兵强姦不遂，用利斧砍斃男女兩人，茲將經過詳情，彙誌於次：</p>
<p>該倉庫于勝利後，當經我軍政部派員接收，駐有少數國軍，尙有敵兵多名，附駐在內。緣有本地童孩孫永丙，年十二歲，任國軍勤務，家中有一姊名桂英，年華十七，尙未字人，因距家不遠，時往孫處探望。會有手帕交名陸金蘭者，與桂英同康，住江灣鎭萬安橋浜南萬壽街三號。九日午後三時，桂英至陸處，邀其外出遊玩，同至其弟永丙處閒談，不意有士兵王鴻者，覩見二姝。頓起歹念薄暮金蘭欲返，由王設計留住。至九時許，二女同睡一榻，永丙及王鴻各據一床，午夜二三時，王起身潛至二女床側，意圖求歡。常經二女峻拒，竟至拔槍威逼，桂英機警，托辭外出如厕，祇賸金蘭一人，王乃向其威誘，亦遭拒絕。乃老羞成怒，以利斧一柄，不問情由，猛砍其頭部，腦漿迸裂，血流如注，當塲香消玉殞其時永丙於熟睡中驚起，駭極欲逃，又遭王拖回，爲滅口計，將其頭腹等處迎砍七斧，暈倒于地，氣息奄奄。桂英在門外，聞呻吟聲，知肇巨禍，狂奔得脫。迨黎明六時，經人發覺，將永丙昇送陸軍醫院療治無效，旋即身死。兇犯王鴻逃逸無踪，已由軍警憲一體嚴令通緝，俾歸案懲辦。</p>
<p>被殺之陸金蘭</p>
<h3>社會服務　提倡安全運動</h3>
<p>— 夏之行</p>
<p>抗戰勝利以後，因汽油可以目由運用，汽車一天天地多了。此外更有盟邦的吉普車，以及電車全天的行駛，馬路上形成非常熱鬧。但車子闖禍的事件，却也漸漸的多起來，所以安全運動實有提倡的必要。安全運動須由本市及盟邦常局本市民三方面合作，方能收切膚之效。</p>
<p>（甲）關於當局應注意者　（一）禁止汽車在路上開極快之速度，並限止汽車最快開至若干度。（二）各馬路口須設交通警位，以維持交通。（三）從速劃定適當之界綫於熱鬧馬路上，汽車依照汽車之界綫走，人力車三輪車，亦依照界綫走，依此類推，不得越界（明年車輛改右行後尤宜注意）。（四）取締無照會之車輛在路上行駛。（五）晚間車輛不能無燈及獨眼燈。</p>
<p>（乙）盟邦方面應注意者　（一）禁止部下乘吉普車出入娛樂塲酒吧間，以免於開車時酗酒生禍。（二）多派憲兵巡迴於各馬路間。（三）取締車行極高速度，並且不得追逐他車。（以上如盟邦不能實行，須由我方交涉之）。</p>
<p>（丙）市民應注意者　（一）行路時宜時刻留心，須行於人行道上。（二）穿越馬路時，須注意兩方面之車輛。（三）下電車時須常注意車輛。（四）遇電車擁擠時，不得攀援電車而行。</p>
<p>末了我希望安全運動，永遠的推行下去。</p>

<h3>燈會</h3>
<p>— 朱曼華</p>
<p>勝利後沒有幾天，我在新安江畔一個小村莊上，這裏也就是我的家。這小村莊只有上百家人家，並且差不多都是種田的莊稼漢，道時候，稻已經快割齊了，稻田裏只剩幾寸長的稻根，一格一格地點綴在龜裂的田野。</p>
<p>玉蜀黍梗的靑氣蕩漾在空中，初嫩的「珍珠米」已經可以摘下來吃了，村莊是靜穆的，勝利的消息，使每個人興奮，訓練中的新中國武士，格外活躍，他們唱歌，唱戲，挑水，打掃，迎泥地上的稻草也堆在一旁，晚上，他們和老百姓撩天，有許多消息，都是由他們帶到鄉村裏來的。從他們的嘴裏，我們知道不久，屯溪將有一次盛大的提燈會。</p>
<p>這兒離屯溪有五十里，但坐車要進城，先得趕二十里路，坐船是「上水船」，怕要一天，只好不看了。村中的老小並不失望，因爲接着又知道朱家村也要提燈，朱家村是一個小鎭，是上屯溪一個必經的水碼頭，更好的是離我們的村莊只有三里路。</p>
<p>等了好幾天，朱家村的提燈會於舉行了。那晚我們提早吃飯，我和法院（這小村唯一的點綴）裏兩位公務員同去，孩子們因爲爛脚不能走路，也沒有福氣看。燈會的行列很長，有半里路光景，店舖門口都掛着紙紮的燈，有兩家火一點的，還掛着八角玻璃燈，小孩子們歡呼，跳躍，大人放着爆仗，「大鑼鼓」和「小鑼鼓」夾雜着，連說話也聽不見。燈綵中最引人注目的是紙紮的B二十九型機，和巨大的兵艦，還有由小孩子扮的「地戲—八仙過海，但沒有「臺閣」和高曉，有些人似乎很失望，但菩薩也終於抬出來。看的人又興奮了提燈會爲什麽有菩薩呢，那花轎上寫了四個字「人喜神歡」，想是菩薩也來參與盛會的。</p>
<p>「我們幾時才有眞的B二十九型和巨大的兵艦呢？」公務員感慨系之地閒。我笑着，回到家，孩子們還沒睡，他們在等待我把所看到的講給他們聽。我告訴他們，我看到B二十九型，還有其他許多，許多的……</p>
<h3>情之所鍾·愛的唯美</h3>
<p>— 趙清閣</p>
<p>自序『此恨綿綿』滬版</p>
<p>「此恨綿綿」是我重返上海的第一次出版書。記得十年前在上海印行的幾本小說，因爲戰爭的原故，都已經絕迹了。如今我希望，也很懼怕，此後我的書會不會再因爲同樣原故，而遭受毀滅！</p>
<p>本劇取材於英國女作家愛美萊·白朗特（Imerey．Beronte）的長篇小說「咆哮山莊」之故事。在結構方而曾參攷了美國好萊塢根據「咆哮山莊」攝製的電影「情之所鍾」。只是爲了配合時代與中國環境起見，主題稍稍加以民族意識的渲染；背景亦改作中國的北方了。</p>
<p>「咆哮山莊」的故事，是一部天然的悲劇之素材。我讀過小說三遍，看過電影四次。每讀一遍，看一次，却深深受着感動！白朗特女士只有這一部小說成功了，這部巨作驚人地轟動了一百年前英國文壇！這是一部非常曲折，充滿沉鬱氣氛，而帶幾分神秘性的小說。白朗特女士大胆地描寫了原始的人性之發揮，這一點，也許有人會覺得不入常情，但我却是同意的。所以在本劇裏，我也充分表現了這個獨特的風格。白朗特女士以細膩的筆調，分析着人類微妙的心理變態，同時她强烈地赤露露闡明了一種尊崇情操而唯美的愛底哲學。側面，她又烘托出英國常時的文化思潮，以及英國社會的「霧」底形態。</p>
<p>由於這部巨作的本身文學價値之偉大，美國好萊塢於是把牠攝製成電影；我才不揣淺陋地又把牠改爲舞台劇本。</p>
<p>爲了我要盡量保持原作的情調，本劇在演出者眼裏看來，或稍嫌文藝性了些，但我也曾用心地隨時顧及到舞台的條件。這是我寫戲的一貫態度，我總希望我的劇本不僅能演，而且能讀；絕不願其僅能演而不能讀。或者有時我不免太偏於「讀」的一方面了—就是文藝氣氛過分濃厚了所誚太溫；甚而太冷了因此不合於演出者的胃口。不過我總覺演出的舞台效果固然重要，作者對於劇本本身的文學價値，也是不可忽視的。</p>
<p>執筆本劇遠在三年以前。那時我住在重慶近郊的北碚鎭上，爲了愼重，由構思，搭架子；到起草，殺靑；差不多費了七個多月的光陰。這期間承「咆哮山莊」的譯者梁實秋先生帮忙，給了我許多珍貴的意見。兩年前渝版出書以後，內地各城市即紛紛演出，我自己曾經看到過兩次的演出。一次是重慶國立歌劇學校的演出，（李朴園先生導演）一次是重慶水泥公司的演出，聽說水泥公司演出期間，還鬧出一幕眞實的悲劇—公司經理的小姐，年輕貌美，爲了戀愛不遂，一時被感情蒙蔽，竟於觀後本劇自殺了！因此有一位朋友來責難我說：『不管她自殺的原因是爲什麼，至少「此恨綿綿」有增加她對人生的感傷，而助長她求死的決心之嫌疑。』理智上，我絕不能承認負絲毫的責任；但感情上，却相當引起我的不安！我曾一再反省，在本劇裏面我是不是有過誇張戀愛至上，甚而鼓勵自殺的意思呢？不，我絕對沒有這意思！　我只是忠實地表現了白朗特女士對於人類的一種尊崇情操而唯美的愛底哲學。我希望讀者和觀衆再看本劇時，能够從深處去理解。</p>
<p>人生，戀愛宛如藝術；藝術是唯美的，戀愛自然也不應當離開唯美。情之所鍾，便達到了唯美的境界。爲「唯美」而釀成的許多悲劇的素材，就是人類性靈底眞實與善良的表現！這眞實與善良的反面，遷伏着無限恨的源原；「恨」由「愛」來，無恨即無愛；所以恨又可謂唯美的徵象。這唯美的微象有消極和積極之分，消極的是犧牲；積極的是超脫。「咆哮山莊」裏面白朗特女士把兩代人分兩個階段描寫；前一代爲鬥爭不過客觀現實的惡勢力，而消極地懷着痛苦作了犧牲。後一代却堅決不屈地和惡勢力反抗，而積極地獲得了痛苦的超脫，這便是白朗特女士對於唯美的愛底哲學觀所啓示的一條出路。「此恨綿綿」也是根據這個原則寫的，劇中主人公辛苡珊的憂鬱而死；和男主公安克夫的瘋在報復；正表現了他們消極的唯美的徵象；白莎的反抗出走，刦表現了她能超脫痛苦的感情束縛，而完成積極的唯美的徵象。</p>
<p>愛，固可促人以自殺；但亦可敎人以自救！只要你能把握住理智，善於運用唯美的情操。</p>
<p>假滬版之機緣，重序本劇，藉申要義。</p>
<p>於三四，十二，二上海的寒夜。</p>

<h3>新瓶舊酒</h3>
<p>— 吳仞之</p>
<p>舊瓶裏旣好裝新酒，因此我想到新瓶裏也不妨裝舊酒。裝得合適不合適，那是另外一件事。</p>
<p>孟子梁惠王掌：「梁惠王曰，寡人之於國也盡心力焉耳矣。……察隣國之政無如寡人之用心者。隣國之民不加少，寡人之民不加多，何也？」孟子在當時是相當能站在老百姓立塲說話的人，而梁惠王竟能稱之曰「叟」而見之，見之而詢以得民之道。倘以現代的名詞稱之，則竟可說是不失爲比較開明的王，也好說是比較進步的王。假使梁惠王生在現代，我想他便必不會僭號稱王了，然必自成一派。於是他的問話也就勢必改了幾個字。據我想來，則必曰「敝派之於國也盡心焉耳矣。……察異派之政無如鄙人之用心者。異派之衆不加少，敝派之衆不加多，何也？」於是孟子的答話便也得改去一字，而曰：「養生送死，無憾，派道之始也。」派亦有道。你看孟子引申下去的話眞有道理。也是祗須改去一個悖時的稱呼——「王」字。我想假使他們不是朋友的話，那便或許在現代決不肯作那樣不世故的對答，所以還是代以「閣下」相稱罪。於是，孟子的話：「今也制民之產，仰不足以事父母，俯不足以畜妻子。樂歲終身苦，凶年不免於死亡。惟救死而恐不瞻，奚暇治禮義哉。閣下欲行之，則盍反其本矣。」</p>
<p>「瓶」是形式，「酒」是內容。上面說的是新形式裏加舊的內容，也就是爲「新瓶裝舊酒」聊備一格。</p>
<p>商業新聞</p>
<h3>「孫票」傳說紛紜中　金鈔突然回漲</h3>
<p>商品價格依然疲軟</p>
<p>金市昨上塲承前收餘勢，賣氣仍　，即破入六〇萬大關，見五八萬五低價，銀行繼續吸收，頹勢得以支持，美鈔由疲而穩，穩而漸俏，人心遂漸回頭，同時擱置已久之孫票，又成爲硏究問題，漸盤漸堅，重又回出六〇萬大關，銀樓帮大量吸納，籌碼突形枯竭，近午已步漲至六五萬以上，下午更爲興奮，銀根鬆濫，擁資者紛紛購進，空方已成强弩之未，急切追補，竟拉高至六八萬左右，結果較前收回漲六萬八，趨勢極爲堅俏，事實上各銀行連朝吸收不已，擁資者以拆息過賤，紛紛留置自用，浮多斬殺殆盡，籌碼泰半流入實力派手中，更易反動，銀樓飾金亦步昇至七萬三，絞銀米更，仍爲六百元，銀元亦盤旋於四百二至四百三，拆息因連日疲檔，散戶仍具戒心，未見十分堅俏，昨約八分至一角一分。</p>
<p>外幣　昨疲後突俏，人心反動甚烈，蓋以掛牌謠言，連綿多日，種種揣測，旣無事實證明，且孫票問題，根本有利於買戶，同時中國銀行對出口匯票，暫支法幣一千元，迄未更動，一經思疑，局面頓時改觀，即自九四〇元最低價逐步盤好至一〇八〇元，喊價且有迫近一一〇〇元者，結果較前收漲一百元强，港幣初開尙低，老貨喊一九〇元，新貨五〇元，尙有供給，後以廣帮獲訊，新貨在港，已有四折以上作價，姑以申市老貨二〇〇元之價計算，新貨亦値八十元以上，同時航務人員亦證明是說絕對可靠，港滬既已通航，買戶遂紛紛活動，爭購之下，竟激漲十餘元，老貨亦被帶好，結果老貨較前收回升二十元，新貨十一元。</p>
<p>公債　初開在前收價之下掙扎，報紙旣有孫票之謠言刋載，業中人舊事重提，一經揣測，買氣遂被激動，大戶推波逐瀾，中途稍有盤旋，惟結果終以高價收市，較之前收回漲三十五元至五十五元不等，惟收後稍有浮多脫手。</p>
<p>股票　華股先時尙見疲弱，後以金價美鈔反動殊烈，業中人亦被激奮起，結果較前收大股好一成弱，小股則好一成至一成半，惟冷門各股仍形遜色，反有軋跌者，外股亦隨大勢所趨，初低後高，形勢平穩，小型股中紙榮漸與怡啤軋近，結果與前收相較，略有回好，冷門各股仍屬有供無求。</p>
<p>米糧　昨日米市晨間開盤猛跌不已，收市店方乘巧拾取，略見轉挺，較昨仍小三四百元，麵粉因美麥已由阜豐福新代製成粉，將以一部份供給本市平價銷售，是以一致下跌三四百元，成交極稀，油市以來源仍續，廠方亦有應市，出售價續小千元，杜豆小千元，豆餅隨之跟小三百元。</p>
<p>紗市　因連日所跌頗鉅，上午金價已穩，故各路客帮食指大動，採辦頗股，午後金價續漲，是以紗綫又升一格，計上下午各漲一二萬，人心已回，趨勢看挺</p>
<p>煤市　頹勢難挽，仍爲賣風所籠罩，市價一致續跌甚厲，尤以高檔各貨白煤塊等，前因存底枯竭，漲勢過巨，近聞來源有望，故持貨者心慌爭出，反動回跌亦較巨，柴炭來源湧旺，去胃微細，市價繼續下落。</p>
<h3>經濟簡報</h3>
<p>安建兒金獅牌全脂奶粉，爲上海乳品廠出品，堪與舶來品媲美，近以行銷日廣已在設法增產，另出黃牛奶檯子白脫一種，係用純粹賣牛奶油提煉而成。</p>
<p>本埠外商洋行復業後，已開始接受各方定貨，聞三十五年一月底前後，即可運到云。</p>
<p>近來重慶內匯漸活躍，各地均有成交，以申滙爲大宗，中國農民銀行之滙率爲百分之七十二至七十，每日成交七八千萬元，各行莊亦紛紛减低滙率降爲百分之六十五，故益形熱鬧。</p>

<h3>Korean Landscape and Customs</h3>
<p>[United Press Seoul Telegram, 10th] Korea, also known as Joseon, as the name suggests, should be a land full of fresh vitality. However, for 4,300 years, there has been no peaceful day. Wars, rebellions, and conspiracies have emerged endlessly, so foreigners call it the "Eastern Ireland." Koreans are taller than Japanese, and their skin is fairer. Japanese workers hate them quite a bit, probably because Koreans are hardworking and can work harder than others even when they are hungry. They can be compared to Chinese farmers and are far beyond the reach of the Japanese. Seventy-five percent of Korean land is cultivated by tenant farmers. Under Japanese rule, each person averaged only two bushels of rice per year. Koreans, unlike the Japanese, like to eat meat, but they regard slaughtering as a humble profession. Scholars have the highest status, deeply influenced by the traditional Chinese thought of "all occupations are inferior, only studying is superior." Korean mythology claims to be descendants of heavenly gods. According to legend, an ancient god took pity on human beings and personally came down to the lower realm. He saw a chaste woman by the water and conceived after being blown with immortal air, giving birth to the ancestor of the Koreans. Korean religion is a mixture of primitive worship, Buddhism, and Confucianism, but in recent years, influenced by Europe and the United States, more and more people believe in Christianity. The Korean population is about 23 million, and there are about 500,000 Christians, of whom 287,000 belong to the Presbyterian Church and 115,000 belong to the Catholic Church. Koreans like to wear American-style hats, and there are even more people wearing Western suits than in Tokyo. In the old Korean custom, both men and women wore white clothes. It is said that this custom originated hundreds of years ago, when the authorities were in mourning for the king for three years, and the people uniformly wore white. Unexpectedly, the kings who succeeded to the throne did not live long, and three of them died in succession, so mourning clothes became everyday clothes. But today, influenced by foreign countries, this custom is gradually being abolished. It is said that the Japanese especially hate white clothes and often like to splash ink on Korean clothes and force them to be dyed. Koreans regard the Japanese as cultural upstarts, because Japan's import of Chinese culture was first indirectly transmitted from Korea. Forgetting their roots, the Japanese are unjust. Movable type printing was introduced to Korea from China fifty years before it was invented in Europe, which shows how early it was civilized. In 1592, they used ironclad ships to fight and destroy the Japanese fleet, 300 years earlier than Perry's bombardment of Japan. Japanese-published travel guides claim that Korean youths can enjoy modern education, but in reality, only 18 percent attend school. In Japan, 99 percent are forced to receive general education. The true policy of the Japanese in governing Korea can be seen in the words of a certain governor-general: "Koreans can be made to do things, but cannot be made to know things." Most of the true education of Koreans was founded and operated by foreign missionaries, so the Japanese hate them to the bone. Korean houses are mostly mud-walled flat houses with grass or tile roofs. The ground is paved with stone slabs and covered with mats or oiled paper. The stove chimney passes under the stone slabs for heating, which is a very clever method. The Korean territory is a peninsula, but its land is mostly mountainous, with only 25 percent of the total area being arable land. Rice is the main agricultural product. Under Japanese rule, one-third of the annual harvest was taken by the Japanese. The land is barren, so human waste is used as fertilizer, so there is a risk of contracting dysentery and typhoid fever from eating fresh vegetables. Korean families are headed by the mother-in-law, which is also a strange custom. Usually, the man is the head of the household, and his wife is in charge of domestic affairs, but once his son marries a wife, the daughter-in-law is responsible for the work, and the mother-in-law comes with her, taking over the role of host and acting as the ruler of the whole family.</p>

<h3>American Newspaper Reviews the Situation in China, Saying That the Communist Party Uses Any Means Necessary to Damage the Nation and Alienate Sino-American-Soviet-British Friendship</h3>
<p>[United Press, Los Angeles, 10th] An editorial in the "Herald Express" stated: A strong and unified China is closely related to world security, and the United Nations should assist China when necessary to restore peace in North China. The involvement of the United States in the North China dispute is also for this reason. We should examine the Chinese Communist Party with a realistic eye, looking at its motives and actions. It must be known that the Chinese Communist Party is a political party, not a country. What it wants to seize by force is usually resolved by voting, without the need for bullets. They have actually exhausted all the methods within their power, such as frontal attacks, conspiracies to sabotage, malicious propaganda, and other vicious methods, to damage the Republic of China and alienate China's friendship with the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States. Its purpose is to overthrow China's organized government, and this must not be allowed to happen. In this situation, the United States and the United Nations should assist China in establishing a truly representative government, so that the Communist Party and other parties have the right to be heard in national affairs and to vote in elections. As a political party, the Chinese Communist Party should have freedom of speech and the right to vote, but if it holds armed forces, it must be disarmed and dispersed. Therefore, if necessary, the United Nations should use force to assist the legitimate government of China so that North China can regain peace. Once this fact is , Chairman Chiang should convene a national conference to formulate wise laws to produce a representative government, the sooner the better.</p>

<h3>France Between the Two Powers of Britain and the Soviet Union; Decides to Maintain a Balanced Position; De Gaulle Elucidates Future Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 11th] General de Gaulle broadcasted yesterday, saying that France's new mission in today's world is to maintain a balance between the powers. France has been able to avoid civil war and preserve its independence, and will pay more attention to consolidating it in the future. The world is in a situation of confrontation between two powers, and we are in the middle. For our own interests, we can only maintain a balance and maintain friendship with both sides. Our eyes must not be ignored, and our hands must not be slightly restricted. When the powers do not allow France to approach, we must urge them to pay attention. This balance is in line with peace, so we must not abandon it.

What is needed today is to restore the spirit of the previous trilateral meetings and reach a solution through adjustments and compromises. If the secrets and suspicions caused by the atomic issue can be swept away at the meeting, then other issues related to Iran or the Balkans can be easily resolved.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 10th] It is not yet certain when British Foreign Secretary Bevin will depart, but it is believed that the delegation will go within this week, and the possible date is Friday.</p>

<h3>Special Commentary: Enterprise Capital and Tax Issues in Recovered Areas</h3>
<p>— Wang Zhi</p>
<p>Capital, as the term is used here, refers to the total assets of an enterprise minus all liabilities, representing the net worth. When an enterprise begins, capital is immediately put to use, and the value of the assets increases or decreases accordingly. Profits and losses are therefore inevitable. The original invested capital only represents the amount invested by shareholders and the number of shares held; it cannot represent the net worth of the enterprise. This is quite obvious. Unfortunately, the standard adopted by our country's current income tax system only considers the actually paid-up capital or the actually invested principal. For those with reserve funds, only one-third is allowed to be included in the capital calculation, and the tax rate is determined according to the ratio of net profit to the amount of capital. The principle of full progressive taxation is used, making the determination of the capital amount crucial to the amount of tax payable.</p>
<p>Since the War of Resistance, currency inflation and devaluation have caused most industrial and commercial enterprises to show huge profits when calculated in monetary terms. Some of these profits are indeed from operating income, but most are due to currency devaluation. Merchants in the recovered areas, in order to protect their original assets and avoid excessive donations during the enemy's occupation, have tried to evade taxes. Some hid assets in reserve funds, others hid them in inventory, and some even fabricated accounts to conceal assets. Commercial ethics have also deteriorated completely. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, the central government is trying to encourage production and promote investment. It may be beneficial to take advantage of the situation where merchants want to re-adjust their capital amount but are constrained by the tax system. The method of collecting business profit tax for both categories A and B in 1945 should be temporarily revised to achieve the principle of taxing profits without harming the principal. This way, the old hidden and false practices of the industrial and commercial sectors can be restored along with the land. Based on my limited understanding, I propose the following measures for adjusting enterprise capital for reference in levying business profit tax. I hope that knowledgeable people can provide corrections.</p>
<p>(1) The adjustment of capital should be based on the actual situation of each enterprise. — The capital situation of each enterprise is different. Some were originally valued in legal tender and converted to puppet currency at a rate of two to one in June 1942. Some were originally converted from legal tender to puppet currency and then increased capital with puppet currency. Some new enterprises have used puppet currency as the unit of account from the beginning. The situations vary. If we convert the book puppet currency amount of the first type of enterprise to legal tender at a rate of 200 to one, then a million-dollar enterprise before the war would now only have 2,500 yuan in capital. Therefore, a huge amount of assets would be designated as profits and subject to income tax. This is too unfair and would only deter future investors, which goes against the government's intention to encourage enterprises. I believe that the establishment period of each enterprise is different, the currency value at that time is different, and the gains and losses of their operations are also different. Therefore, the adjustment of capital should be determined based on the actual situation of each enterprise and should not be based on the rate of 200 to one. The government has no explicit regulation requiring enterprise capital to be converted to legal tender at a rate of 200 to one. The proclamation issued by Commander-in-Chief He in August this year stated that private creditor-debtor relationships should be allowed to be settled independently. Therefore, my capital adjustment method does not conflict with the law. I hope that after adjusting the capital amount, there will be no more attempts to hide assets, and previously hidden assets will be re-entered into the accounts. From now on, the government should use the rule of law as the standard, and merchants should use honesty as the best policy.</p>
<p>(2) Labor should not be entitled to capital gains. — Some say that the adjustment of capital depends on the allocation of capital gains, and this capital gain may cause labor-capital disputes internally. I believe that all gains arising from currency devaluation and property appreciation are capital gains. For example, if a house originally valued at 10,000 yuan in 1937 is now worth 2 million yuan, the difference of 1.99 million yuan is a capital gain, not a profit from business operations. Labor should not be entitled to it.</p>
<p>(3) Method of calculating capital gains. — China has never had accurate price statistics. However, to calculate the capital gains of each enterprise itself, I believe that it is only necessary to use the assets related to the main business operated by the enterprise itself as the standard. The price index outside the business scope is difficult to obtain for a while, and it is not necessary to obtain it. The reason why shareholders invest in an enterprise is that they believe that the enterprise has investment value and are interested in it. They should not seek unexpected income outside the business. The government also does not allow merchants to operate businesses outside their scope. Therefore, Article 22 of the new Company Law stipulates that "a company shall not operate businesses outside its registered scope." From this point of view, to seek capital gains, one can subtract the start-up expenses from the amount of share capital paid up by an enterprise, and then use the price index of the fixed assets and main raw materials and goods necessary for the enterprise at that time as the base. Then, use the current price index of the same assets to find the percentage. Multiply the remainder by this percentage and subtract the original capital amount to get the enterprise's capital gains. The equation is:</p>
<p>A = Capital amount; B = Start-up expenses; C = Percentage of the current price index to the price index when the share capital was paid up; D = Capital gains.</p>
<p>[(A - B) × C%] - A = D</p>
<p>For example, a weaving factory was established in 1937 with a capital of 100,000 yuan. The necessary start-up expenses at that time were 30,000 yuan, leaving a balance of 70,000 yuan. Now it seems certain that it should be fully invested in fixed equipment and cotton yarn, dyes, and coal necessary for the textile industry. If the price index ratio of these assets is 30,000%, then substitute into the above equation to find that its capital gains are 20.9 million yuan. If an enterprise has increased its capital several times in the middle, then the increased portion should be calculated separately in stages according to when each installment of capital was paid up, using the above method. The sum of these is the enterprise's capital gains from the beginning to the present. If you want to make this calculation precise, then when deriving the price index, you should select important assets and include them in the statistical materials, and calculate them together according to the proportion that each asset should account for in the total capital, based on the actual situation. The percentage of the index obtained should be more accurate. If the materials are not selected carefully, the calculation will be unreliable. For example, financial institutions can include interest rates, securities, and foreign exchange. If financial institutions include cotton yarn, coal, etc., they will lose their accuracy.</p>
<p>(4) The drawbacks of excessively high property appreciation. — If all capital gains are transferred to capital, there will inevitably be many drawbacks. Now that the War of Resistance has ended, transportation has resumed, all industries have been revived, prices have fallen, and the currency value will gradually recover. If the capital gains generated by currency devaluation are fully used as capital, losses will inevitably occur when the currency value rises in the future, which is not a stable way to run an enterprise. Moreover, if property appreciates too much, resulting in excessive profits, if a few shareholders do not want to continue investing, they can assert their rights and demand that cash be distributed under that profit item. The right to receive dividends and the right to receive gifts are private rights, which are different from public rights such as voting and election, and cannot be enforced by law. Also, if the appreciation is too high, losses will inevitably occur when the currency value recovers in the future, and both labor and national taxes will suffer losses, which is not what accounting should do. I do not take it. From this point of view, the standard of property appreciation should be moderate and stable.</p>
<p>Therefore, I hope that the income tax of 1945 can be revised to use the adjusted capital amount of each enterprise as the standard, and then calculate the ratio of income amount to this adjusted capital amount to determine the tax rate to be levied. At the same time, the portion of capital gains transferred to capital should be exempt from taxation. And adopt a simplified tax collection method. — The income tax rates adopted in the United Kingdom and the United States are indeed very high, but the degree of currency devaluation in China is very different from that in the United Kingdom and the United States. The average price in the United States has only increased by 28% compared to 1939. The United Kingdom has also only increased by 30% compared to the same year. Therefore, the income tax in the United Kingdom and the United States does not damage the original capital of the enterprise. If our government strictly enforces the current tax rate, then the 1 million yuan of capital before the war mentioned in the above example would be converted to 2,500 yuan as imagined by the general public. If you want to restore the capital amount before the war, you must pay 199,500 yuan of income tax in the compensation amount of 997,500 yuan. If the capital gains arising from property appreciation are also regarded as ordinary profits, then the income tax will have taken most of the enterprise's property for the government. This is like draining the pond to catch all the fish. Now the government has repeatedly stated that it wants to revitalize industry and encourage people to invest. It can be seen that it will definitely not adopt the means used by Russia after the success of the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917 to confiscate private capital through the tax system. I deeply hope that the wise and wealthy authorities will sympathize with the difficulties of businessmen, and that all enterprises that transfer capital gains to capital will be exempt from tax, and that the tax collection method for the income tax of 1945 will be temporarily revised. It is hoped that China's young enterprises can slightly recover from their accumulated difficulties after eight years of war, and that the government will also be able to legislate loosely and enforce strictly.</p>

<h3>General Wedemeyer States: Severely Punish U.S. Military Violators; Chinese Police Should Increase Assistance</h3>
<p>U.S. Army Commander of the China Theater, General Wedemeyer, declared yesterday: He will take "severe disciplinary measures" to punish any U.S. soldiers in Shanghai who violate regulations, regardless of their rank. Wedemeyer told reporters that he is "determined to correct" the recent misconduct of U.S. military personnel in Shanghai, such as theft, brawls, disturbing the peace, and traffic violations. The number of civilians who died as a result of an accident involving a two-and-a-half-ton military truck on Saturday night has now reached four, with several others seriously injured. The truck crashed through one of the busiest areas of Shanghai. Although the driver who caused the accident has been wanted and a reward of 100,000 yuan in legal tender has been offered by the U.S. Army authorities, he has not yet been apprehended. He believes that one of the reasons for the increasing number of illegal acts by U.S. military personnel is that the Chinese police authorities are unwilling to stop the illegal actions of Americans in military uniform. Whenever an unfortunate incident occurs, the Chinese police often fail to record the names of the perpetrators and the license plate numbers of the vehicles, resulting in the authorities having no complete records for investigation. To help correct this situation, the U.S. military authorities are now issuing all military vehicles with a Chinese license plate. Wedemeyer further stated that there is a shortage of trained U.S. military police in Shanghai, as many military police officers have been sent back to the United States or transferred to other posts. He has asked Mayor Qian to instruct Chinese police officers to "take severe and swift steps" to arrest any Americans who cause accidents in the future.</p>
<p>Wedemeyer concluded: General MacArthur will not be able to come to China in the short term, but he has expressed his gratitude for Chairman Chiang's telegram. The remaining U.S. military supplies will be sold to the Chinese government.</p>
<h3>U.S. Withdrawal Service Group Invites Reporters for a Visit</h3>

<h3>Motor Vehicles Without Licenses Prohibited from Traveling in the City</h3>
<p>In view of the inconsistency of license plates for motor vehicles traveling in the city, the municipal government, in order to prevent criminals from taking advantage of this, has notified all motor vehicles traveling in the city to register with the Public Works Bureau. The registration deadline has now passed. From the 15th of this month, all motor vehicles without the city's "Guo Hu" license plate, regardless of whether they are owned by the military, government, public or private sectors, will be prohibited from traveling within the urban area.</p>
<p>Active Preparations for Vehicles Keeping to the Right</p>
<p>The central government has stipulated that from next year, vehicles will uniformly switch to driving on the right. The city is actively preparing for this change. All trams and public buses (the doors and boarding platforms will be moved to the right side) and traffic lanes on the roads and some traffic lights will need to be modified. Newly revised diagrams of traffic police hand signals and driver hand signals have been printed and distributed to police officers and drivers for early practice.</p>

<h3>Soldier's Attempted Rape Failed, Two People Killed with an Axe: Major Bloodshed Case on Songhu Road, Shanghai East</h3>
<p>[Special Report from this Newspaper] The former sports ground on Songhu Road in Shanghai East, which is the site of the receiving warehouse of the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs, suddenly saw a major human tragedy happen on the morning of the 10th. The incident was caused by a soldier whose attempted rape failed, and he killed a man and a woman with a sharp axe. The details of the incident are compiled as follows:</p>
<p>After the victory, the warehouse was taken over by personnel sent by our Ministry of Military and Political Affairs, and a small number of national troops were stationed there, as well as many enemy soldiers attached to it. A local child, Sun Yongbing, 12 years old, worked as a servant for the national army. He had an older sister named Guiying, 17 years old, who was not yet married. Because it was not far from home, she often went to Sun's place to visit. There was a friend named Lu Jinlan, who was with Guiying Tongkang, living at No. 3, Wanshou Street, Wan'an Bridge, Jiangwan Town. At 3 p.m. on the 9th, Guiying went to Lu's place and invited her to go out to play. They went to her brother Yongbing's place to chat. Unexpectedly, the soldier Wang Hong saw the two beauties. He suddenly had evil thoughts. At dusk, Jinlan wanted to return, and Wang designed to keep her. At about 9 o'clock, the two women slept in the same bed, and Yongbing and Wang Hong each occupied a bed. At two or three o'clock in the middle of the night, Wang got up and sneaked to the side of the two women's bed, intending to have fun. He was often rejected by the two women, and even resorted to drawing a gun to threaten them. Guiying was clever and made an excuse to go out to the toilet, leaving only Jinlan alone. Wang then threatened and seduced her, but was also rejected. He became ashamed and angry, and with a sharp axe, without asking why, he slashed her head, causing her brains to splatter and blood to flow like a fountain. She died on the spot. At that time, Yongbing was awakened from his sleep. He was extremely frightened and wanted to escape, but was dragged back by Wang. In order to silence him, he slashed his head and abdomen seven times, causing him to faint and collapse to the ground, barely breathing. Guiying heard the moaning sound outside the door and knew that a major disaster had occurred. She ran away madly. At dawn at 6 o'clock, someone discovered it and sent Yongbing to the Army Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective and he soon died. The murderer Wang Hong has fled and is being strictly ordered to be arrested by the military, police and gendarmerie to bring him to justice and punish him.</p>
<p>Lu Jinlan, who was killed.</p>
<h3>Social Services: Advocating Safety Movement</h3>
<p>—Xia Zhixing</p>
<p>After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, as gasoline could be used freely, the number of cars increased day by day. In addition, there were also Allied jeeps and trams running all day long, making the roads very lively. However, incidents of cars causing trouble have gradually increased, so it is necessary to advocate a safety movement. The safety movement must be a cooperation between the city and the Allied authorities and the citizens of the city in order to achieve effective results.</p>
<p>(A) Matters that the authorities should pay attention to (1) Prohibit cars from driving at extremely fast speeds on the road, and limit the fastest speed of cars to a certain degree. (2) Traffic police should be stationed at each road intersection to maintain traffic. (3) Quickly delineate appropriate boundaries on busy roads, with cars following the car boundaries, and rickshaws and pedicabs also following the boundaries, and so on, without crossing the boundaries (especially after vehicles are changed to right-hand traffic next year). (4) Crack down on vehicles driving on the road without a license. (5) Vehicles cannot be without lights or one-eyed lights at night.</p>
<p>(B) Matters that the Allies should pay attention to (1) Prohibit subordinates from riding jeeps to and from entertainment venues and bars, so as to avoid accidents due to drunk driving. (2) Send more military police to patrol the roads. (3) Crack down on extremely high speeds and prohibit chasing other vehicles. (If the above cannot be implemented by the Allies, it must be negotiated by our side).</p>
<p>(C) Matters that citizens should pay attention to (1) When walking, you should always be careful and walk on the sidewalk. (2) When crossing the road, you must pay attention to vehicles on both sides. (3) When getting off the tram, you must always pay attention to vehicles. (4) When trams are crowded, you must not climb on the tram to travel.</p>
<p>Finally, I hope that the safety movement will be promoted forever.</p>

<h3>Lantern Festival</h3>
<p>—Zhu Manhua</p>
<p>It was a few days after the victory. I was in a small village by the Xin'an River, which is also my home. This small village has only hundreds of families, and almost all of them are farmers. At that time, the rice was almost harvested, and only a few inches of rice roots were left in the rice fields, decorating the cracked fields in squares.</p>
<p>The green air of the corn stalks wafted in the air, and the young "pearl rice" could already be picked and eaten. The village was quiet. The news of the victory excited everyone. The new Chinese warriors in training were particularly active. They sang, performed plays, carried water, cleaned up, and the straw piles on the muddy ground were also piled aside. At night, they chatted with the old folks. Many news stories were brought to the countryside by them. From their mouths, we learned that there would soon be a grand lantern festival in Tunxi.</p>
<p>It is fifty miles from here to Tunxi, but to take a car to the city, you have to travel twenty miles first. Taking a boat is an "upstream boat," which may take a whole day, so it is better not to watch it. The old and young people in the village are not disappointed, because they then learned that Zhujia Village would also be holding a lantern festival. Zhujia Village is a small town, and is a necessary water terminal to get to Tunxi. Even better, it is only three miles away from our village.</p>
<p>After waiting for a few days, the lantern festival in Zhujia Village was held. That night, we ate dinner early. I went with two civil servants from the court (the only decoration in this small village). The children could not walk because of their rotten feet, and they were not blessed to see it. The lantern procession was very long, about half a mile. The stores were all decorated with paper lanterns. Two of the stores with more fire had octagonal glass lanterns. The children cheered, jumped, and the adults set off firecrackers. The "big drums" and "small drums" were mixed together, and even talking could not be heard. The most eye-catching lanterns were the paper B-29 type aircraft and the huge warship, as well as the "ground play—Eight Immortals Crossing the Sea" played by children, but there were no "platforms" and Gao Xiao. Some people seemed very disappointed, but the Bodhisattva was finally carried out. The people who watched were excited again. Why is there a Bodhisattva in the lantern festival? The sedan chair had four characters written on it: "People are happy and gods are happy." It is thought that the Bodhisattva also came to participate in the grand event.</p>
<p>"When will we have real B-29s and huge warships?" the civil servant asked with emotion. I smiled and went home. The children were not asleep yet. They were waiting for me to tell them what I had seen. I told them that I saw a B-29 type, and many, many others...</p>
<h3>The Clock That Strikes in the Heart: The Beauty of Love</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>Preface to the Shanghai Edition of "This Enduring Regret"</p>
<p>"This Enduring Regret" is the first book I've published since returning to Shanghai. I remember that the several novels I had published in Shanghai ten years ago have all disappeared because of the war. Now, I hope, and also fear, that my books will not suffer destruction again for the same reason!</p>
<p>This play is adapted from the novel "Wuthering Heights" by the English female writer Emily Brontë (Imerey. Bronte). In terms of structure, I have referred to the Hollywood movie "The Clock That Strikes in the Heart" based on "Wuthering Heights." However, to adapt it to the times and the Chinese environment, the theme has been slightly infused with national consciousness, and the background has also been changed to northern China.</p>
<p>The story of "Wuthering Heights" is a natural tragic material. I have read the novel three times and watched the movie four times. Every time I read it, every time I watch it, I am deeply moved! Ms. Brontë only succeeded with this one novel, and this masterpiece sensationally stirred the British literary scene a century ago! This is a very tortuous novel, full of melancholy atmosphere, and with a hint of mystery. Ms. Brontë boldly depicts the development of primitive human nature, which some people may find unconventional, but I agree with it. Therefore, in this play, I have also fully expressed this unique style. Ms. Brontë analyzes subtle psychological changes in humans with delicate strokes, while at the same time she strongly and nakedly elucidates a philosophy of love that respects sentiment and is purely aesthetic. On the other hand, she also highlights the cultural trends of the time in England, as well as the "foggy" state of British society.</p>
<p>Due to the greatness of the literary value of this masterpiece itself, Hollywood has adapted it into a movie; I have dared to adapt it into a stage play despite my superficiality.</p>
<p>In order to preserve the mood of the original work as much as possible, this play may seem a bit too literary to the performers, but I have also carefully considered the conditions of the stage at all times. This is my consistent attitude when writing plays. I always hope that my scripts can not only be performed, but also read; I never want them to only be performed and not read. Or perhaps sometimes I am too biased towards the "reading" aspect—that is, the literary atmosphere is too strong, which is criticized as being too gentle; or even too cold, and therefore not suitable for the taste of the performers. However, I always feel that while the stage effect of the performance is important, the author's literary value of the script itself cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>I started writing this play more than three years ago. At that time, I lived in Beibei Town, near Chongqing. For the sake of caution, it took me almost seven months from conception, framing, to drafting and completion. During this period, I was helped by Mr. Liang Shiqiu, the translator of "Wuthering Heights," who gave me many valuable opinions. After the Chongqing edition was published two years ago, various cities in the mainland have been staging performances one after another. I myself have seen two performances. One was the performance of the Chongqing National Opera School (directed by Mr. Li Puyuan), and the other was the performance of the Chongqing Cement Company. I heard that during the Cement Company's performance, a real tragedy occurred—the company manager's daughter, young and beautiful, was temporarily blinded by her emotions due to unrequited love, and committed suicide after watching this play! Therefore, a friend came to accuse me and said: "No matter what the reason for her suicide, at least 'This Enduring Regret' has increased her sadness about life and fueled her determination to seek death." Rationally, I absolutely cannot admit any responsibility; but emotionally, it caused me considerable unease! I have repeatedly reflected on whether I have exaggerated the supremacy of love in this play, or even encouraged suicide? No, I absolutely do not mean that! I am just faithfully expressing Ms. Brontë's philosophy of love, which is both aesthetically beautiful and respectful towards humanity. I hope that readers and audiences can understand it deeply when they watch this play again.</p>
<p>Life and love are like art; art is aesthetic, and love naturally should not deviate from aesthetics. When emotions are focused, they reach a purely aesthetic realm. Many tragic materials caused by "aesthetics" are the true and good expressions of human nature! The opposite of this truth and goodness hides the source of infinite hatred; "hatred" comes from "love," and without hatred, there is no love; therefore, hatred can also be said to be a symbol of aesthetics. This aesthetic symbol has negative and positive aspects. The negative aspect is sacrifice; the positive aspect is transcendence. In "Wuthering Heights," Ms. Brontë describes two generations in two stages; the previous generation passively sacrificed with pain because they could not fight against the evil forces of objective reality. The latter generation resolutely resisted the evil forces and actively gained transcendence from pain. This is an outlet revealed by Ms. Brontë's aesthetic philosophy of love. "This Enduring Regret" is also written based on this principle. The melancholy death of the protagonist Xin Yishan in the play; and the madness of the male protagonist An Kefu in revenge; precisely demonstrate their negative aesthetic symbols; Bai Sha's rebellion and escape, shows that she can transcend the emotional constraints of pain and complete the positive aesthetic symbol.</p>
<p>Love can certainly drive people to suicide; but it can also teach people to save themselves! As long as you can grasp reason and are good at using aesthetic emotions.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the Shanghai edition, I re-preface this play to state the essentials.</p>
<p>On a cold night in Shanghai, December 2, 1945.</p>
<h3>Inscription on Mr. Fu Baoshi's Painting of Red Leaves</h3>
<p>— Lao She</p>
<p>Eight years of obscurity in wind and rain;</p>
<p>Ten thousand leaves shining on the frosted river.</p>
<p>In a small boat, carrying wine,</p>
<p>Boundless affection for the rivers and mountains!</p>
<p>Brushstrokes of History</p>
<h3>Old Wine in New Bottles</h3>
<p>— Wu Renzhi</p>
<p>Since old bottles are good for holding new wine, I think new bottles might as well hold old wine. Whether it fits or not is another matter.</p>
<p>In Mencius' "King Hui of Liang," it is said: "King Hui of Liang said, 'I have devoted my mind and strength to the country. … Examining the politics of neighboring countries, none is as attentive as I am. The people of neighboring countries do not decrease, and the people of my country do not increase. Why?'" Mencius was quite capable of speaking from the people's standpoint at the time, and King Hui of Liang was able to call him "elder" and meet with him, and ask him about the way to win the people. In modern terms, he can be said to be a relatively enlightened king, or a relatively progressive king. If King Hui of Liang were born in modern times, I think he would not dare to call himself king, but he would definitely form his own faction. Therefore, his question would inevitably be changed by a few words. As I see it, he would say, "Our faction has devoted its heart to the country. … Examining the politics of other factions, none is as attentive as I am. The people of other factions do not decrease, and the people of our faction do not increase. Why?" Then Mencius' answer would also have to be changed by one word, and say: "Providing for the living and seeing to the dead without regret is the beginning of the way of the faction." Factions also have ways. Look at the words Mencius extended, they are truly reasonable. It is also only necessary to change a name that is out of date—the word "king." I think if they were not friends, then perhaps they would never have been willing to give such unsophisticated answers in modern times, so let's replace it with "Your Excellency" as an apologetic term. Therefore, Mencius' words: "Now you control the people's property, so that their income is not enough to support their parents, and not enough to raise their wives and children. In good years, they suffer all their lives, and in bad years, they cannot escape death. They are only concerned with saving the dying and fear that they will not be able to provide enough. How can they have time to govern rites and righteousness? If Your Excellency wants to implement them, then why not return to the root?"</p>
<p>"Bottle" is the form, "wine" is the content. The above is about adding old content to a new form, which is just to prepare for "old wine in new bottles."</p>

<h3>"Sun Notes" Rumors Abound; Gold Notes Suddenly Rebound</h3>
<p>Commodity Prices Remain Soft</p>
<p>The gold market yesterday continued the momentum of the previous closing. Selling pressure remained strong, and it broke through the 600,000 mark, reaching a low of 585,000. Banks continued to absorb, and the downward trend was supported. The US dollar changed from weak to stable, and then gradually became popular. People's confidence gradually returned. At the same time, the long-shelved Sun Notes became a research issue again, gradually becoming firm and firm, and returned to the 600,000 mark. Silver shops absorbed a large amount, and the chips suddenly became exhausted. By noon, it had risen to over 650,000. The afternoon was even more exciting. The money market was loose and flooded, and those with funds rushed to buy. The shorts had become exhausted, and urgently chased after them, pushing the price up to around 680,000. As a result, it rebounded 68,000 compared to the previous closing, and the trend was extremely firm. In fact, various banks have been absorbing continuously for days, and those with funds have kept them for their own use because the interest rate was too low. Most of the floating shorts were killed, and most of the chips flowed into the hands of strong parties, making it easier to react. Silver jewelry in silver shops also rose to 73,000. The price of silver for rice remained at 600 yuan. Silver dollars also hovered between 420 and 430. Due to the fatigue of the interest rate for several days, retail investors were still wary and did not see it very firm. Yesterday, it was about 8% to 11%.</p>
<p>Foreign currencies suddenly became popular after being weak yesterday. People's confidence reacted very strongly. The reason is that the rumors of listing prices have been continuous for many days, and various speculations have not been proven by facts. Moreover, the issue of Sun Notes is fundamentally beneficial to buyers. At the same time, the Bank of China's temporary payment of 1,000 yuan in legal tender for export bills has not changed. Once suspected, the situation immediately changed. It gradually improved from the lowest price of 940 yuan to 1,080 yuan, and the asking price even approached 1,100 yuan. As a result, it rose more than 100 yuan compared to the previous closing. The Hong Kong dollar opened low at first. Old goods were quoted at 190 yuan, and new goods at 50 yuan. There was still supply. Later, it was learned from the Guangdong group that new goods in Hong Kong had been priced at more than 40% of the original price. Based on the price of 200 yuan for old goods in Shanghai, new goods were also worth more than 80 yuan. At the same time, shipping personnel also proved that the statement was absolutely reliable. Since Hong Kong and Shanghai had opened to traffic, buyers began to actively engage in activities. Under the competition for purchase, it rose by more than 10 yuan. Old goods were also brought up. As a result, old goods rose 20 yuan compared to the previous closing, and new goods rose 11 yuan.</p>
<p>Public bonds struggled below the previous closing price at the beginning. Since the newspaper published rumors about Sun Notes, people in the industry brought up old matters. Once speculated, buying sentiment was stimulated, and large investors pushed the wave and chased after it. There was a slight rotation in the middle, but the result finally closed at a high price, rising from 35 yuan to 55 yuan compared to the previous closing. However, some floating shorts sold after closing.</p>
<p>Stocks. Chinese stocks were still weak at first. Later, the sharp reversal of gold prices and the US dollar stimulated people in the industry. As a result, large stocks rose slightly less than 10% compared to the previous closing, and small stocks rose from 10% to 15%. However, unpopular stocks were still inferior, and some even fell. Foreign stocks also followed the general trend, first low and then high, and the situation was stable. Among the small stocks, Paper Glory gradually approached Yipi. As a result, there was a slight improvement compared to the previous closing. Unpopular stocks were still supplied without demand.</p>
<p>Rice. The rice market opened sharply lower yesterday morning. The store side took the opportunity to pick it up at the close, and it turned slightly stronger, still down 300 to 400 yuan compared to yesterday. Flour prices unanimously fell by 300 to 400 yuan because US wheat has been made into flour by Fufeng Fuxin on a commission basis, and a part of it will be supplied to this city for sale at parity prices. The volume of transactions was extremely scarce. The oil market is still continuing in terms of source, and the factory is also responding to the market. The selling price continued to decrease by 1,000 yuan, and soybeans decreased by 1,000 yuan. Soybean cakes followed suit and decreased by 300 yuan.</p>
<p>Yarn market. Because the prices have fallen quite a lot for several days, the gold price has been stable in the morning, so the fingers of various customer groups moved greatly, and the purchasing was quite strong. In the afternoon, the gold price continued to rise, so the yarn and thread rose another point, with each rise of 10,000 to 20,000 in the morning and afternoon. People's hearts have returned, and the trend is looking strong.</p>
<p>Coal market. The downward trend is difficult to reverse, and it is still dominated by the selling trend. Market prices have continued to fall sharply. In particular, high-end goods such as white coal blocks, etc., which had previously risen too much due to the exhaustion of inventory, have recently heard that the source is promising, so the holders panicked and competed to sell, and the rebound and fall were also relatively large. The source of firewood and charcoal is abundant, and the demand is weak, and market prices continue to fall.</p>
