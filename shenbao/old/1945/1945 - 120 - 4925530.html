<h3>日陸海空軍呼應作戰　猛攻冲繩艦船羣　本島敵軍傷亡一萬五千名</h3>
<p>東京二十九日中央社電　冲繩本島附近之敵艦船，現有戰艦四五艘，巡洋艦十艘，驅逐艦十五艘至二十艘，運轍船四五十艘，日特攻隊刻仍對之猛烈攻擊，日陸上砲隊亦乘機對敵艦船加以砲擊。二十七日對嘉手納西方海面之敵艦船羣加以攻擊，擊毀焚燒敵大型運輸船二艘，並投彈擊中戰艦一艘，由於日空陸呼應攻擊，敵艦砲射擊逐次減少。又中北兩飛機場，亦因受日航空部隊及地上砲火之妨害，以前擁有敵機一百五十架，然二十六日僅不過六十架，由是敵海上及航空兩勢力，於過去太平洋戰綫顯著未見有如此弱化。又敵登陸以來，僅冲繩本島陸上戰果，至二十三日判明者，計敵兵員死傷達一萬五千名，戰車擱置焚燒二百六十九輛以上。</p>
<p>東京二十九日中央社電　沖繩本島南部地區之敵軍，二十六日晨以來開始新攻勢，二十八日晨復於幸地以東地區，以步兵約五百，坦克車約二十輛，開始攻擊該地，日軍毀其坦克車四輛，殺傷步兵二百餘名，而將其擊退。是時頃，前出西方敵軍五百，坦克車五十餘輛，又向前田中間城間方面進擊，遭日軍迎頭痛擊，受傷甚大。他方日軍特攻隊於海上反覆攻擊，二十七日午前五時餘，對敵艦船突入成功，戰果尙未確認。又是日下午九時四十五分，突入嘉手納海面之特攻隊，轟沉戰艦或巡洋艦一艘，擊沉艦種不詳艦船三艘。二十八日上午零時四十分，復於慶良間列島附近擊沉運輸船一艘，擊傷巡洋艦及運輸船各一艘，水上特攻隊亦呼應猛攻。二十七日夜，突入嘉手納海面之敵運輸船團，將滿載坦克車，汽車及其他軍需之一萬噸級大型貨船一艘，其橫倒頻遊貨物中之小型舟艇約十艘均予擊沉外，並擊沉驅遂艦一艘</p>
<p>東京二十九日中央社電　日航空部隊二十八日夜攻擊慶良間羣島敵陸上陣地，炸毀天幕營戶各一所，飛行艇一艘焚燒，此外，中飛機場並有四處大火。</p>
<p>琉球羣島基地二十九日中央社電　二十八日冲繩方面天氣好轉後，日軍航空部隊以特別攻擊隊為中心，繼續猛攻本島周邊之敵艦船羣，擴大戰果，詳情尙未判明。然二十八日黎明，衝入敵艦船羣之航空部隊一隊，擊毀空母二艘，戰艦一艘及運輸船一艘。</p>
<h3>日宮內昨擧行天長節儀式　政府表彰各生產戰士</h3>
<p>東京二十九日中央社電　宮內二十九日晨舉行天長節祭儀式，日皇於上午八時三十分親拜皇祖大神以及歷代皇靈，天神地祗，十時受松平宮相，木戶內府，藤田侍從長，運沼侍從武官長，廣幡皇后宮大夫等祝賀，十時十分，在鳳凰間受各皇族祝詞，至二十分出正殿，受宮內高級官員拜賀，皇后於下午一時三十分在內宮受松平宮相等拜賀。</p>

<h3>大東亞各地周間戰况</h3>
<p>東京二十九日中央社電　茲將本周大東亞各地戰况誌次：</p>
<p>馬里亞納方面：馬里亞納之敵空軍，現為完成戰術航空隊，動員硫黃島之小型機，連日來襲九州，將其基地之準備能力全部恢復，為今日敵空軍唯一之任務。</p>
<p>菲律賓方而：薩拉克薩克山嶺方面之敵軍，由於日軍之激戰，二月來犧牲甚大，但仍繼續頑强攻擊。二十一日來對薩拉克薩克山嶺東方之伊模岡山西南之日陣地來攻，經日軍部隊勇敢善戰，將其粉碎。又巴來泰山嶺方面，米奴利山嶺東西綫，刻正展開激戰，敵之一部侵入日軍陣地，該方面日守軍正與之激戰中，其他地區無大變化，日軍以挺進突擊，迫使敵軍流血。敵軍於菲律賓中部·南部逐次擴張地盤，以圖整備基地，準備次期作戰。</p>
<p>緬甸方面：自曼達萊公路南下之敵機甲部隊，十八日通過賓馬拉南進，以擁有戰車約三十輛之敵軍一部，二十一日達謬烏拉，又一部似已進入東古。同時與此呼應之伊洛瓦底河方面之敵軍，上旬以來，亦發動攻勢，一部東進，十九日抵馬庫。二十日侵入愛朗靖地區，日陸上部隊對之加以邀擊，刻繼續奮戰。日航空部隊亦相呼應，攻擊曼達萊公路之敵機甲部隊，二十一·二兩日間，擊毀車輛一百八十輛。</p>
<p>西南太平洋方面：對婆羅資源地帶來襲之敵機，時以二三十架之編隊，反覆轟炸偵察，該方面之敵軍企圖，頗須警戒。</p>
<p>冲繩方面：南部地區之上戰鬥，二十六日晨以來，敵以熾烈之地上砲擊，艦砲射擊，集中於中央高地附近，擁有戰車有力之敵軍，開始攻勢，經日軍果敢反擊，至二十六日夕刻，其新攻勢即遭挫折。二十七日朝，敵於前日激戰地區中央高地方面之幸地以西地區再度展開攻勢，日軍當地部隊對之邀擊，到處擊碎敵軍，幸地以東敵於上午十一時餘，自首里東北約四公里之翁長方面擁有戰車四輛，步兵約七十人來攻，遭日機關槍之猛射及突擊，續有多數死傷，向幸地北方地區敗退。幸地以西方面，中間前田附近，敵攻勢更形熾烈，二十七日其一部進出前田南方，受日軍之反擊，在前田地區開始構築陣地。又西海岸方面，敵以步兵二千五百乃至三干，戰車十餘輛來攻城間附近，經日軍部隊勇敢反擊，其攻勢悉被阻止，現在第一綫之敵總兵力，約有戰車步兵五千。</p>
<h3>前綫歸來某准尉談冲繩軍民奮戰情况</h3>
<p>敵美在冲繩本島登陸後不久，於四月五日頃取得該島的北飛行場和中飛行場，但日軍守備隊的肉搏猛攻，絲毫未見緩和。其作戰的勇敢，足使美兵戰慄；其抵抗的劇烈，令美軍流血甚多。在艦砲射擊飛機轟炸以及重戰車的橫行之下，守衛冲繩的日軍，以及全島的居民，是如何果敢地邀擊着憑恃物質數量的美軍呢？據來自冲繩本島的某准尉口述情形大抵如次。按某准尉是在美軍登陸前因要公而離開該島的。以下是某准尉的話。</p>
<p>陣地上復歸靜默。海空泛出鮮紅，一輪旭日遠遠昇起。是早晨了。整夜的艦砲射擊，到了這時終於停止。這是一個靜得出奇的淸晨。警戒了一夜的戰友，現在都酣睡洞窟中。數小時以前猛攻敵艦的空中勇士，也安然高臥，似乎不曾有過劇鬥一樣。這個島嶼，就是靠這一班心神安定的大胆勇士們保衛的。想到這一點，我的胸中熱血如沸，不禁遙向東方拜伏。這批豪壯的勇士雄姿，迄今還很淸晰的浮現在我眼。</p>
<p>因去年十月十日格拉曼艦上機的掃射，那霸市早已化為灰燼。市民經過這次試鍊，立即活用戰訓，在身心雙方都完全武裝起來，早就預防敵軍的侵襲南西諸島。果然，到了三月一日，敵艦載機累計約九百架飛來空襲全島。這天的掃射轟炸，比十月十日更熾烈，但島上居民有完備的防空壕，都很安全。是日，島上的對空火器，除出一部分外，依然默不作聲。因為開火之後，縱然能够擊下數十架敵機，却可使敵人探知我方陣地所在，為此不得不咬緊牙齒，忍耐着不開高射砲，要塞砲，以待敵軍上陸時大施神威。</p>
<p>敵軍在神山島，前島上陸的三月卅一日，冲繩本島也受到熾烈的艦砲射擊。在此以前，已數次經騐到一天五·六百發砲彈射擊的全島市民，早就準備如何應付敵軍的上陸作戰。自淸晨到夜晚，格拉曼艦上機不斷襲擊飛行塲和那覇市，瘋狂似地掃射。從敵艦飛來的砲彈，不絕落在冲繩島的南部，隆隆的砲聲，自白畫到夜晚，片刻不停，彷彿將地皮也快翻了過來。可是，在這天翻地覆似的緊張場面，將士和居民却沉着應付，奮勇作戰。</p>
<p>自從去年十月十日以來，全島住民即已奉默全力，協助軍事當局，使全島化為一大要塞。無論是要塞陣地也好，洞窟也好，都是居民一鍬一鍬，一筐一筐地築造成功的。婦女們則在臨時趕造起來的爐灶上燒煮山薯，送給士兵和勞動服務隊的人去吃。冲繩因產山薯甚多，可補食米的不足。此島的士兵中，有〇〇第一中學，第二中學，及〇〇的第三中學和〇〇的縣立農業學校學生。在敵機掃射和艦砲集中射擊下，男學生負起連絡的要務，忙碌地東奔西走。〇〇的第一高女，〇〇的第二高女，〇〇的第三高女及〇〇的昭和高等女學校等女學生，則一律白帕包頭，拿着鋤鍬畚箕，從事劇烈的勞動。因為她們的家大多已遭燬壞，衣服之類也多損失，所以各人各穿手頭我得到的衣服，不能像以前那樣穿一色的制服了。不過，她們的努力依然如故。而且她們認為再吃白米飯的話，緊急時會影響到軍糧的，所以改吃山薯。在軍民合作之下而築成的要塞陣地和洞窟，從三月三十一日起，便成為使敵兵大流其血的據點。敵艦射來的砲彈，炸裂時威力和二十五公斤的炸彈一樣，但因此而死傷者簡直沒有，這就是托着洞窟堅固之福。</p>
<p>飛行場上，在某中佐的指揮下，自數日前起，即派出特攻隊猛攻接近海岸的敵機動部隊。出發時，隊員雖希望用白布包頭，可惜沒有布。而餞別的盛宴，也只有一碗湯和山薯飯。然而誰也沒有感到不滿，都欣然為國捐軀，含笑出擊，並且還對負責掩護的友軍道謝，說是耍他們費心同去哩。廿八日擊沉敵方航空母艦的甲軍曹，就是特攻隊之一。現在，敵軍雖已侵入北飛行場和中飛行場，但空中的勇士仍繼續從別的基地出擊，建立了大本營發表的那種偉大戰果。</p>
<p>我因為在敵軍上陸以前就奉命飛離冲繩，到此處來接洽要公，所以沒有機會參加邀擊戰。今日，那個青葱的冲繩島想必已化為慘烈的戰塲了吧·然而，島上的軍民一定竭力奮戰，而肉搏挺進隊尤能發揮神威。肉搏挺進隊是嚴格訓練出來的，以若干名組為一班，潛入敵陣，用威力極大的炸藥，將敵軍的要點炸個粉碎，然後向倉皇不知所措的敵兵猛攻，用鋼刀與槍刺斬瓜切菜地殺個痛快。這種斬殺敵兵的訓練，行之已久。就是島上居民，也由軍方直接指導劈刺術，用竹槍嚴格訓練。冲繩全島旣已成為要塞，而且還有這樣精銳的軍隊和島民，當然不會輕易落入敵手，何况四五六三個月內，冲繩方面必有猛烈的颶風，所以殲敵的時機正在我們眼前。（細川及吉岡特派員，譯自四月七日每日新聞）</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>歐洲戰局透視</h3>
<p>最近一週間的歐洲戰局，以柏林會戰為中心，迅速轉移，其問較為注目的，一為蘇軍包圍柏林，二為英美蘇軍在易北河會師，三為義大利北部戰局的變化，協約軍進占熱內亞等城市。但是所有這種戰役上的推移，在大體上對於整個歐洲戰局的戰略上意義，並不如一般觀察者所想像的重大。我們應該指出，這種戰役上的推移，巳經使歐洲戰局進入新的階段，但同時更應該指出，這種推移，並不是歐洲戰爭的終結。</p>
<p>首先從柏林的爭奪戰來看，反軸心軍抱着速戰速決的野心，希望按照克里米亞會該的決定，實現英美蘇三軍在柏林會師，由三國合組統制委員會加以占領。然而這個計劃迄未實現，英美軍隊離開柏林還遠，蘇軍以必得之心，大舉推進，以白俄羅斯及烏克蘭兩大方面軍的兵力一百五十萬，投進了柏林的大火坑。那麼，在協約國的整個戰略上说固然未必是最後的成功，因為蘇軍冒重大犧牲之後是否能再對英美讓步，很成疑問。即僅以蘇軍戰略而論，這樣重大的犧牲有何實際價值，及今後其他各戰綫兵力的調整和補充，也是很大的問題。何况柏林德軍還在堅持抗戰，決為國都洒盡最後一滴血而決不屈服。</p>
<p>其次，從南部德國戰綫來看，英美蘇三軍雖已於日前實現會師，但是雙方都已師老兵疲，在前綫則三軍作戰區劃及合作問題，殊多爭議；在後方則德國的「人狼部隊」等，到處在淪陷區展開游擊戰爭，深入德境的反軸心軍，不免有發覺「來得去不得」的一天。至於義大利北部的戰局，自反軸心軍於日前進抵波河沿岸以後，米蘭，熱內亞各地，叛軍佔據城市，這當然算不得是反軸心軍作戰的勝利。何况北義山峻林密，今後的作戰，更有持久的傾向。</p>
<p>第三，從整個歐洲戰局來看，反軸心軍的兵力，已在義大利北部，德奧地區，德國西部和北部，處處分割，每一地區，都必須保留龐大數量的軍隊，始能維持其佔領，而由於佔領區的德國人民都是久受訓練，隨時隨地抵禦敵人，因此，反軸心軍更須繼續支付大量的補給力，支持這種地區的佔領。因此種種，反軸心軍對歐洲必須繼續支付龐大戰力，對於本身力量自必日趨削弱，縱使三國間不立刻發生政戰二略上的分裂，其前途也殊難樂觀。</p>
<p>反之，德國在敵軍深入的現狀下，却並沒有氣餒的表示，縱使柏林被佔，但德國人決不會就此放下武器，德國尙有差不多三分之一的領土，繼續保有相當作戰力的工業地帶，海岸及港灣，和丹麥挪威等盟國，依然具備堅持作戰的條件，每一寸土地，都要使對方支付加倍的代價。所以，說歐洲戰局即將結束，尙嫌過早。</p>
<p>在歐洲戰局轉入新階段之際，有兩點特別值得注意：第一，由於歐戰不能迅速解決，英美蘇克里米亞會議的戰略可說已有大部分破裂，三國首腦勢將再度集商新的世界戰略。第二，由於英美蘇三國對歐洲佔領區必須繼續支付戰力，以資維持其佔領區，因此誰也不能抽調大量兵力到其他戰區，如英美欲圖抽調兵力到東亞戰場，此時尙談不到，不僅如此，而且還得從他們本國繼續供應補給，維持佔領地區。</p>
<p>整個世界戰局不是趨向結東，而是趨向於持久戰，惟有誰能完成國民的總力動員，舉物心兩力以集中於決戰，誰就能爭取最後的勝利，這才是今日我們東亞人民所應共同努力的方向。我國朝野尤當掃除一切幻想，面對現實加强奮鬥！</p>
<h3>昨襲九州敵機被擊落三架　宮崎鹿兒島空戰熾烈</h3>

<p>里斯本二十九日中中社電　舊金山來電：舊金山會議二十七日舉行全體會議，澳大利亞·比利時·玻利維亞·巴西·加拿大各代表次第演說，一致主張維護中小各國權利，反對大國之獨裁，會議前途不容樂觀。</p>

<h3>飢餓綫上的歐洲</h3>
<p>由於食糧的極端不足，歐洲各地正發出苦惱的呻吟，尤其在被攻佔的各國。這些國家——即法·荷·比·希臘等——都陷在深刻的飢餓狀態中，包孕着非常可怕的危機。</p>
<p>法國糧食奇缺</p>
<p>先來看一看法國的情形。據三月二十一日路透社巴黎電，最近三個月來，巴黎巿民誰也得不到一滴油，肉類在這三星期內，也沒有人能够吃到一片；本星期中，糖的配給證雖已發了下來，可是依然買不到它。市民們說，恐怕在最近的將來連麵包也將沒有吧。大部分的法人家庭，這三個月以來，僅賴白菜和少量的馬鈴薯等果腹。巴黎幼兒，產婦，病人所需的牛乳，每日至少五十萬公升，而實際上所產的牛乳不到三十萬公升。法國被攻佔以來，到了第七個月，却碰到開戰以後最大的食糧危機。為克服這個日益深刻的廣汎的飢餓危機，絕對須有非常措置。但更壞的是常局對於前途的預測也看不出什麼光明。</p>
<p>為了不能忍受這種食糧缺乏的苦痛，三月二十日巴黎婦女五千名曾有示威行動，列隊遊行。這種情形不限於巴黎，並且波及里昂，格爾諾堡，安內瑪斯等大都市。當時法國國內政治情勢的顯出緊張狀態，多少亦由於此故。</p>
<p>比利時與荷蘭</p>
<p>比利時的情形與法國相仿，但荷蘭的現狀則更壞。荷蘭不但受到兵燹，並因洪水戰術的施行而發生水災，情况十分險惡。據倫敦荷蘭流亡政府首相說，「荷蘭的糧食不足今後三個月之用」。據他說，英國人一日平均可攝取二千六百至三千卡路里熱量的食物，而一般荷蘭人則平均不到七百卡路里。</p>
<p>英國深感焦灼</p>
<p>綜合各方面的情報，現在歐洲各國的營養水準，英國為三千卡路里弱，法比約五百卡路里，義大利·挪成等也瀕於和法國相同的危險狀態。在這可怕的食糧困難面前，英國極度焦燥，變成神經質的。三月十九日英國新政治家與國家報曾發出如下的警告：</p>
<p>「失望了的歐洲各國，戰後將會背叛英美吧。戰爭不會在德國降伏時即告結束的，須在歐洲食糧困難的苦惱完全消弭時纔能終了。」</p>
<p>泰晤士報亦稱：</p>
<p>「不久的將來，反軸心方面的眞正敵人將不是德國，而是歐洲食糧，衣服，住宅的不足。現在正是必須講求緊急措置的時候。」</p>
<p>英美政治對立</p>
<p>由於英美方面對於供給歐洲食糧一事完全失敗之故，自然大失歐洲各國所望。並且英美之間也因而發生深刻的政治對立，英美互相埋怨詬啐的聲調也愈來愈響。三月中旬，華盛頓方面廣播說：「英國貯藏着七萬萬噸的食糧」，並稱：「美國食糧當局為免沮喪美國民衆及將士的士氣起見，不擬再加緊限制美國國民的食糧，所以考慮完全停止供給歐洲及英國以食糧。」此項貯藏食糧七萬萬噸之說，使英國國民大為驚愕。因此，邱吉爾於同月二十一日正式表明英國的立塲，努力辯稱：</p>
<p>「恰與美國所說相反，英國現在的食糧貯藏量實在不到六百萬噸，而且從今日起到六月底止，將更減為四百七十五萬噸。這個數量，在現在的配給組織下，是供給英國國民絕對必要的最低數量。」</p>
<p>同日瑞士報社倫敦通訊員更傳述英國政府的公開說明如次：</p>
<p>「再行强化肉類配給的限制，將使英國人民與將士憤懣，而欲維持現在的水準，則捨英國完全停止肉類輸歐之外，別無他法。」</p>
<p>總之，對於美方的攻訐，英國政府假邱吉爾與糧食大臣劉威林之口，辯稱「歐洲各國之瀕於飢餓，並非英國之故。」</p>
<p>因為美國政府宣稱從四月份起，供給英國的肉類減少八分之一，所以英國政府與國民都很憤慨。此因歐洲的食糧狀况將更窘困，同時又知道美國人民所吃的肉類比英國民衆肉類配給量多三倍。</p>
<p>除出肉類以外，其他各種食物，也是美園豐富得多。例如牛乳的比率，英國是四九，美國是六四，鷄是一九比二八，雞蛋是二三比四一，油是三八比四四，糖是六五比八四，蔬菜是七五比二〇六。又據另一報道稱：「比較去年的肉類配給量，英軍得一五〇磅，英人得一〇七磅，而美軍士兵則各人可得三百磅。」</p>
<p>美國糧食貯藏量，現在正在徐徐減少，確是事實。尤其是過去數個月中，減少很多。但從歐洲人看來，美國國民在目前的狀况中實不能說食糧缺乏，正如英國現在的情勢不能稱為徬徨於「飢餓綫」一樣。但以歐洲的飢餓為背景的英美論爭，乃是世界政策上極重要的問題。歐洲深刻的食糧狀況，由政治上看，實為現在及戰後英美政策上致命的威脅。鑑於此種軍要性，英副首相阿特里曾調查歐洲情形而在下院作活潑的討論。而工黨首領格林伍德則於二十九日聲明：</p>
<p>「倘若現在不充分供給歐洲糧食，則反軸心國家將面對歷史上未曾見的最大問題，這是黑死病光臨歐洲時都未曾見過的歷史上最大的難題。」</p>
<p>因為船舶不足</p>
<p>其次可以想到的問題，便是美國為何停止將食糧供給歐洲。停止供給，決不是有利美國，因為肌餓的歐洲是很容易赤化的。畏懼發生這種事實的英美，曾由美國草成夢想的計畫，企圖組織反軸心救濟委員會。此項計畫結果化為泡影；此足證實英美不能將食糧供給歐洲。</p>
<p>美國宣稱最近美國食糧生產的低下，完全由於勞力不足及戰時工業繁榮的綠故，實際上，我們相信，其根本原因是為了船舶不够。（蘇黎支特電·譯自四月六日朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>當局取締抽機後金融將趨正軌</h3>
<p>上周工商市况尙稱堅穩</p>
<p>滬巿金融市况，自本月初旬以來，即因國際情勢之緊張，釀成烚赤公債華股行情動盪不定，尤以投機巿儈乘時活動，故放無稽流　煽惑人心，從事吸收及傾出之慣技，操縱巿價暴漲傾跌，擾亂整個金融。最近一週雖經國府當局令飭本巿經濟有關各機關從事澈査取締，但巿情尙不能恢復過去平穩狀態。</p>
<p>上週一即以當局厲行檢査金融交易手段開始進行，人心當時突轉軟化，烚赤止漲圓平，紋銀亦有回落趨勢，公債殊少變化，華股趨勢恍惚，美亞及永安公司與紗廠等熱門股大跌小回，惟小型股票漲多跌少，幷有數種漲停板之怪象。週二巿况轉小，脚地尙穩，惟股票情勢不振。週三轉趨大跌風，烚赤傾跌一般人心咸感忐忑不定，紋銀驟退二千元之鉅，公債跌風甚勁，股票更因頭寸軋緊，於一片賣出聲中，巿價一落千丈，一般特高價股票散戶，心慌意亂。週四復聞某種有利多頭流言，人心復振，上午巿况尙平，下午烚赤轉跌為　，其勢堅挺，紋銀公債亦見回升，華股有廿餘種漲停板。　五更因銀根鬆弛，外　突來傾力吸收，烚亦重見高峯，公債紋銀漲勢　平，惟股票漲風更厲，熱門股及小型股右九十種漲停板，大部投機商目標莫不轉移股票買賣，週六上半大巿面似趨穩定，烚赤股票先漲後回，公債紋銀均趨平低。據悉：財政當局對於上海金融巿塲之取締非法交易，此後決心嚴格管理，以執行法令，懲處不法市儈，預料商情將來可趨正軌</p>
<p>至於上週間工商方面情形尙稱堅穩，米雜糧油糖及其他日用品漲跌甚微，蓋以運輸交通較前略見便利，物資流通益趨圓滑，在經濟當局嚴格限制之下，巿價不易抬高，惟希右關當局對囤積居奇操縱市價之非法商人。無論係何階級，以不徇情之精神嚴厲澈査懲治，以防物價無故高漲。</p>

<h3>昨聯歡足球賽足球會勝裁判</h3>
<p>四比二上半時各一平手</p>
<p>聯歡足球賽，足聯會對裁判隊，昨日下午三時在膠州公園舉行，因雙方均屬老爺，噱頭必多，因此趨往觀者甚多，情况熟烈，裁判戴麟經，初時裁判攻勢熾盛，張樂於亂軍中打門，馬山兒舉脚搶救，一時大意，演成倒戈趣劇，一比〇裁判佔先。裁判繼續環攻，形勢緊張，幸李寗莊友仁趕到，化險為夷，蒙諾沿邊直入，打中紅心，一比一上半時吿終。老爺兵究屬長力不濟，下半時雙方均調兵遷將，再度交兵，張樂失一必中球，足聯否極泰來，馬山兒建功，惟其間吳守衡情急，用手撲救拍出界外，阿戴執法如山，判作失球，一比二足聯後來居上。惟爾後黃逢住中路興兵，直搗黃龍，二比二又成和局，馬山兒過關斬將，射中紅心，二比三足聯再度居上。旋裁判隊鄂森於二十碼處猛碰沈嗣良犯規，莊友仁射入，此後裁判隊屢次調動人馬，藉以挽轉乾坤，無奈足聯後防森嚴，卒未能得逞，結果足聯以四比二擊退裁判，報復去年一箭之仇。</p>

<h3>黃浦保甲區調査</h3>
<p>— 劉豐</p>
<p>黃浦保甲區所包括之地區為：東起黃浦江邊，西迄山西路，南自南巿界，北達蘇州河。該區本名中央保甲區，自卅三年七月添前法租界麥蘭區第五聯保，及小東門之第六聯保後，始改今名。該區現有六聯保，四十八保，七百九十八甲，總計人口數約十一萬。其總聯保長為吳蘊齋氏，副總聯保長為邵樂平，項繩武兩氏。</p>
<p>黃浦區向為模範保甲區，蓋其地勢極為重要，為上海金融及商業之精華所在，保甲之工作推行最平（三十一年三月一日），自警團之服裝最為完備，防空之訓練最為嚴格，且全區警鈴密佈，每個十字街口均有裝置，共計有六十四隻之多，此項警鈴所通之處，總聯保處有六個紅燈，與警察局相通有六十四隻紅燈，凡有非常事故發生立即發亮，而採取必要之處置。往昔遇有恐怖事件發生，全區實行封鎖，其範圍太大，致行路者頗感不便，現在巳改為聯保封鎖，其範圍大為縮小，便利行路者頗多。</p>
<p>該保甲區保甲捐之徵收為：附戶五十元，二房東每月一百元，店舖其店面一間者二百元，兩間者四百元，三間者六百元，工廠銀行及各大商號每月保甲捐之徵收多為五千元，其最多者為二萬元，每月總計約收保甲費三百三十八萬餘元。其百分交二十處保甲處，其餘充作職員薪工，防空設備，及文具印刷等用。現總聯保辦事處月支十四萬五千元，每聯保月支二萬五千元，保支一萬五千元。總聯保辦事處現有職員二人信差二人，其職員薪津每月僅得三萬二千元，重點米，平價米之權利，均未能享受，因其為中間機關，且為獨立性質，各處津貼全無。耍求加薪旣不獲准，對下又不能向各商號加微費用，故其職員之生活，至為淸苦。</p>

<h3>浦東敵機殘骸參觀記</h3>
<p>— 其昌</p>
<p>前日（二十八）夜十一時許，敵　B29型機二架，進入本巿上空，其中一架自西南方侵滬，低飛掠過巿區上空後，即被日軍探照燈光綫所包圍，繼之遂被擊中起火。因距地面過低，機中人員不及跳出，跌落地面，墜落地點為浦東盛家行此奚家宅之麥田中，附近居民及房屋均未有損害。</p>
<p>昨晨記者曾前往擊落處實地參觀。同行者數人，由天津路碼頭登小汽艇斜渡浦江抵浦東之海軍碼頭，該處已有裝滿擊毀機片之卡車正在卸下。機槍子彈，已一筐一筐盛着。其中也有許多支燒焦了的手槍，從破碎的機　中拖出的機槍，已完全變成了焦黑色，槍管洞口亦已一個個塞滿了泥土。在　堆廢金屬中也有着破衣片，棉絮，麻布，無綫電零件，防毒面具零件，破紙片，身份證，地圖，天文圖，食品罐，藥品，治傷藥說明書等。</p>
<p>記者等攀上此搬運碎片之卡車，直向盛家行駛去，沿途風沙極大，車亦顚箥不已，經一刻鐘左右即抵目的地，車停於公路旁，踏入麥田再行百餘步，始達飛機咪落處，此處苦力正在搬運，兵士數十亦正起　陷入地中之炸彈等，此項炸彈，有兩枚排於一處，尙未爆裂，其直徑在一尺半左右，高露於地面上者亦有四尺多長，據某軍曹稱，每枚重量至少為五百磅，其旁另有已爆炸者一枚，其彈壳厚約一寸。</p>
<p>美機師之屍體多焚毀不全，支離破碎，白皮膚包裹下之肉體，鮮血尙未凝結，魚臭四溢，觀者掩鼻。其手足等猶有可辨者，然已臃腫如　拳鬥手套然。另一具僅有身體中段，頭部及四肢均已不知去向，其他尙有八九處屍體血肉糢糊，皆不完整，更有數屍半截仍　　件插於泥中，正在發掘。此等美人或為機帥，或為無綫電員，或為槍手，或為觀測員，或為響道。其死因或為在空中焚斃，或為跌落後為所携炸彈炸　，或為跌殺，總數約十三四人，無一倖免，此皆由於飛行太低不及使用降落傘之故。</p>
<p>另有飛機滑輪一隻，高　地上，達七八尺，其外膠胎亦有二尺之直徑，另一輪之膠胎已燒去，僅存輪盤及車軸。引擎計有四架亦分落數處，且均焚毀不全，共推進器之葉子板長約三尺以上，闊亦在一尺左右，漆作嫩錄色，至為悅目。更有油箱一隻已破毀，唯箱中間格，，尙依稀可辨，其龐大竟如一小船，據佔計至少可裝汕五六百加侖。</p>
<p>據附近農民稱，在機槍　後，天空發生火光，旋即墜地燦炸，宛若天崩地裂，震耳欲聲，繼之則連發爆炸聲，在地面有十餘處起火，歷久不熄，居民不知所捐，唯聽天由命而已。記者參觀時已近中午，尙有一二處餘烟未盡。</p>

<h3>無毒菌治療劑「新配尼西靈」的硏究</h3>
<p>自磺　胺衍化物問世後，世界科學家羣起硏究無毒菌之特效治療劑，倫敦大學敎授富利民博士乃於一九二九年發見一種　徵菌之生產物，不含毒性而抗菌力特强，即最近盛稱之配尼西靈是也。該項新藥初盛行於英美　國，其後即為世界各國醫藥界所採用，骎骎有駕磺　　製劑之趨勢。顧該項抗菌物質，產量甚少，且其性質甚不固定，故提煉濃縮，殊為困難。普通治療用「配尼西靈」之抗菌力限度，僅能稀釋至一百萬倍，合多量提煉未純之雜質。注射後每有疼痛發熱及血栓形成等副作用。至一九四二年英國學者亞伯拉　及陳意等發明之新製　，名為「新配尼西靈」，其純凈度，遠駕普通「配尼西靈」之上，即稀釋至二千萬倍，仍能充分發揮抗菌力。據試騐結果，知其阻礙細菌繁殖能力，勝磺　胺數百倍，溶解度强，日易於瀰散。其與磺　胺之區別，為活動力不受血液，膿汁之限制，對於組織細胞及白血球並無毒害。自「新配尼西靈」製造成功後，一般　徵素製劑，莫不相形見絀，蓋不但純凈度關係，即單位之標準與正確性亦不能相提並論。於是「新配尼西靈」製品，始為醫藥各界所一致倡導。</p>
<p>該劑主治由葡萄狀球菌，鍊球菌，淋菌及肺炎雙球菌感染各症以及腦膜炎·白喉·　胸·梅毒·骨髓炎·敗血症·產褥熱·破傷風·猩紅熱·丹毒·疗瘡·氣性壤疽·以及一切創傷·凍瘡火傷等，莫不如響斯應，藥到病除。稱為現代之十全化學治療劑，實無疑議。惟該劑不耐久藏，如貯於德國製之黃色「耶那」安瓿內，始歷久不至變性，故捉煉技術以及保持器物，影響業力，殊非淺鮮。聞本巿近有國人自製之「新配尼西靈」製劑問世，性能之優，已具世界學術生應有條件，臨床實騐，相當滿意，造福病胞，實匪淺鮮。（劉文瑞）</p>

<h3>Japanese Army, Navy, and Air Force Coordinate Operations, Fiercely Attack Okinawa's Fleet, Enemy Casualties on the Main Island Reach 15,000</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) – Enemy warships near Okinawa's main island currently consist of approximately 4-5 battleships, 10 cruisers, 15-20 destroyers, and 40-50 transport ships. Japanese special attack units are still fiercely attacking them. Japanese land artillery is also taking the opportunity to shell enemy warships. On the 27th, an attack was launched on enemy fleets west of Kadena, destroying and burning two large enemy transport ships, and a battleship was hit with bombs. Due to the coordinated attack by Japanese air and land forces, enemy naval artillery fire has gradually decreased. Furthermore, both the central and northern airfields have been hampered by Japanese air force and ground artillery fire. Previously, the enemy had 150 aircraft, but on the 26th, there were only about 60. Consequently, enemy naval and air power has weakened to an extent not seen in past Pacific campaigns. Moreover, since the enemy landing, the confirmed land battle results on Okinawa's main island alone, up to the 23rd, show that enemy troops suffered 15,000 casualties, and over 269 tanks were disabled and burned.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) – Enemy forces in the southern part of Okinawa's main island launched a new offensive starting on the morning of the 26th. On the morning of the 28th, approximately 500 infantry and 20 tanks launched an attack on the area east of Kochi. Japanese forces destroyed four of their tanks, killed or wounded over 200 infantry soldiers, and repelled them. At approximately the same time, 500 enemy soldiers and over 50 tanks advanced westward towards the area between Maeda and Nakagusuku, encountering fierce resistance from Japanese forces and suffering heavy losses. On the sea, Japanese special attack units repeatedly attacked. On the 27th, at a little after 5:00 AM, a successful raid was launched on enemy warships, but the results have not yet been confirmed. Furthermore, at 9:45 PM that afternoon, a special attack unit that penetrated the waters off Kadena sunk a battleship or cruiser and three other ships of unspecified type. At 12:40 AM on the 28th, another transport ship was sunk near the Kerama Islands, and a cruiser and a transport ship were damaged. Naval special attack units also coordinated in the fierce attack. On the night of the 27th, a large 10,000-ton cargo ship fully loaded with tanks, vehicles, and other military supplies, which was part of an enemy transport convoy that penetrated the waters off Kadena, was sunk, along with about ten small boats floating among the cargo. In addition, a destroyer was sunk.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) – On the night of the 28th, Japanese air force units attacked enemy land positions in the Kerama Islands, destroying tent camps and burning one flying boat. In addition, there were four major fires at the central airfield.</p>
<p>Ryukyu Islands Base, 29th (Central News Agency) – After the weather improved on the 28th, Japanese air force units, centered around special attack teams, continued to fiercely attack the enemy fleet around the main island, expanding their achievements. Details are still unclear. However, one unit of the air force that charged into the enemy fleet at dawn on the 28th destroyed two aircraft carriers, one battleship, and one transport ship.</p>

<h3>Weekly War Situation in Various Parts of Greater East Asia</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) – The following is a record of the war situation in various parts of Greater East Asia this week:</p>
<p>Mariana Islands Area: The enemy air force in the Mariana Islands is now completing its tactical air force, mobilizing small aircraft from Iwo Jima, and its sole mission is to restore the preparation capacity of its Kyushu bases, which have been attacked daily.</p>
<p>Philippines Area: Enemy forces in the Saraksak mountain range have suffered heavy casualties since February due to intense fighting with Japanese forces, but continue to attack stubbornly. Since the 21st, they have attacked Japanese positions southwest of Mount Imogan, east of the Saraksak mountain range. Japanese troops fought bravely and skillfully, crushing the attack. Furthermore, fierce battles are currently unfolding in the Balete mountain range and along the east-west line of the Minuli mountain range. Part of the enemy has invaded Japanese positions, and the Japanese garrison is engaged in fierce fighting with them. There are no major changes in other areas. Japanese forces are forcing the enemy to bleed through advancing assaults. The enemy is gradually expanding its territory in the central and southern Philippines in an attempt to establish bases and prepare for the next phase of operations.</p>
<p>Burma Area: The enemy armored units advancing south from the Mandalay Road passed through Pinmana on the 18th and advanced south. A portion of the enemy, possessing about 30 tanks, reached Myauk U on the 21st, and another portion appears to have entered Toungoo. At the same time, enemy forces on the Irrawaddy River front, in coordination with this, have also launched offensives since the beginning of the month. One part advanced eastward and reached Magway on the 19th, and invaded the Alanmyo area on the 20th. Japanese land forces are engaging in interception attacks and continuing to fight valiantly. The Japanese air force is also coordinating, attacking enemy armored units on the Mandalay Road, and destroying 180 vehicles on the 21st and 22nd.</p>
<p>Southwest Pacific Area: Enemy aircraft attacking the Borneo resource area repeatedly bomb and reconnoiter in formations of 20-30 planes. The enemy's intentions in this area require vigilance.</p>
<p>Okinawa Area: In the battles in the southern region, since the morning of the 26th, the enemy has concentrated intense ground artillery fire and naval gun fire on the vicinity of the central highlands. The enemy, possessing tanks and strong forces, began an offensive, but due to courageous counterattacks by Japanese forces, the new offensive was thwarted by the evening of the 26th. On the morning of the 27th, the enemy launched another offensive in the Kochi area west of the central highlands, the site of the previous day's fierce battle. Japanese units in the area engaged in interception attacks, smashing the enemy everywhere. East of Kochi, the enemy attacked from the Onaga area, approximately four kilometers northeast of Shuri, with about four tanks and 70 infantry soldiers at a little after 11:00 AM. They were met with intense machine-gun fire and assaults from the Japanese, suffered numerous casualties, and retreated to the area north of Kochi. West of Kochi, near Maeda and Nakagusuku, the enemy's offensive intensified. On the 27th, a part of them advanced south of Maeda and began to construct positions in the Maeda area due to Japanese counterattacks. Also, on the west coast, the enemy attacked the vicinity of Chatan with 2,500 to 3,000 infantry soldiers and over ten tanks, but their offensive was completely blocked by the courageous counterattacks of Japanese units. Currently, the total strength of the enemy on the front line is approximately 5,000 tank infantry.</p>
<h3>A Certain Warrant Officer Returning from the Front Lines Discusses the Fierce Battles of Okinawa's Military and Civilians</h3>
<p>Soon after the American enemy landed on Okinawa's main island, they captured the northern and central airfields around April 5th. However, the Japanese garrison's fierce hand-to-hand combat did not abate in the slightest. Their courage in battle caused American soldiers to tremble; the intensity of their resistance caused the American army to bleed profusely. How are the Japanese forces defending Okinawa, and the island's residents, so resolutely repelling the American army, which relies on material quantities, amidst naval gun fire, air raids, and the rampage of heavy tanks? According to a certain warrant officer from Okinawa's main island, the situation is roughly as follows. The warrant officer left the island before the American landing for official business. What follows are the warrant officer's words:</p>
<p>Silence returned to the position. The sea and sky were dyed crimson, and the rising sun ascended from afar. It was morning. The naval gun fire that had lasted all night had finally stopped. It was a strangely quiet morning. The comrades who had been on alert all night were now sleeping soundly in the caves. The aerial warriors who had fiercely attacked enemy warships hours before were also resting peacefully, as if there had never been a fierce battle. This island is protected by this group of calm and daring warriors. Thinking of this, my chest burned with passion, and I could not help but bow towards the east. The heroic figures of these magnificent warriors are still clearly etched in my mind.</p>
<p>Naha City had already been reduced to ashes by the strafing of aircraft from the Grumman ships on October 10th of last year. The citizens, having undergone this trial, immediately utilized war training and fully armed themselves in both body and mind, preemptively preparing for the enemy's invasion of the Nansei Islands. Sure enough, on March 1st, a total of approximately 900 enemy carrier-based aircraft flew in to attack the entire island. The strafing and bombing that day were even more intense than on October 10th, but the island's residents were safe thanks to complete air-raid shelters. On that day, most of the island's anti-aircraft weaponry remained silent. Because after opening fire, even if dozens of enemy aircraft could be shot down, it would allow the enemy to discover the location of our positions. For this reason, we had to grit our teeth and endure without opening fire with anti-aircraft guns and fortress guns, waiting to unleash our power when the enemy landed.</p>
<p>On March 31st, when enemy forces landed on Kami Island and Mae Island, Okinawa's main island also came under intense naval gun fire. Having already experienced bombardments of 500-600 shells a day on several occasions, the island's citizens had long prepared how to deal with the enemy's landing operation. From morning to night, Grumman carrier-based aircraft relentlessly attacked the airfield and Naha City, strafing frantically. Shells fired from enemy warships constantly landed on the southern part of Okinawa Island. The rumbling of artillery fire continued from day to night, seemingly about to overturn the ground. However, in this tense scene that seemed to turn the world upside down, the soldiers and residents responded calmly and fought bravely.</p>
<p>Since October 10th of last year, all of the island's residents had devoted their full strength to assisting the military authorities, turning the entire island into a large fortress. Whether it was fortress positions or caves, they were all built by the residents one spadeful at a time, one basketful at a time. The women cooked yams in makeshift stoves and delivered them to the soldiers and labor service teams. Okinawa produces many yams, which can supplement the shortage of rice. Among the soldiers on this island are students from ○○ First Middle School, Second Middle School, ○○ Third Middle School, and ○○ Prefectural Agricultural School. Under enemy strafing and concentrated naval gun fire, the male students shouldered the important task of liaison, busily running back and forth. Female students from ○○ First Girls' High School, ○○ Second Girls' High School, ○○ Third Girls' High School, and ○○ Showa Girls' High School, all with white cloths wrapped around their heads, engaged in intense labor with hoes, spades, and baskets. Because most of their homes had been destroyed and many of their clothes had been lost, they each wore whatever clothing they could find and no longer wore uniform uniforms as before. However, their efforts remained the same. Moreover, they believed that eating white rice would affect military rations in an emergency, so they switched to eating yams. The fortress positions and caves built through the cooperation of the military and civilians became strongholds from March 31st, causing the enemy to bleed profusely. The shells fired from enemy warships had the same power as 25-kilogram bombs when they exploded, but there were hardly any deaths or injuries as a result, thanks to the strength of the caves.</p>
<p>On the airfield, under the command of a certain lieutenant colonel, special attack units had been dispatched for several days to fiercely attack enemy mobile units approaching the coast. When departing, the team members hoped to wrap white cloth around their heads, but unfortunately there was no cloth. And the farewell feast was only a bowl of soup and yam rice. However, no one felt dissatisfied. All were happy to sacrifice themselves for the country, smiling as they departed, and even thanking the friendly forces responsible for cover, saying that they were troubling them to come along. Sergeant A, who sunk an enemy aircraft carrier on the 28th, was one of the special attack unit members. Now, although enemy forces have invaded the northern and central airfields, the aerial warriors continue to sortie from other bases, establishing the great results announced by Imperial Headquarters.</p>
<p>Because I was ordered to leave Okinawa before the enemy landing to handle official business, I did not have the opportunity to participate in the interception battle. Today, that verdant island of Okinawa must have become a tragic battlefield. However, the military and civilians on the island must be fighting with all their might, and the hand-to-hand combat units will especially display their divine power. The hand-to-hand combat units are rigorously trained, organized into squads of several men, infiltrating enemy positions, using powerful explosives to obliterate key enemy points, and then launching a fierce attack on the panicked enemy troops, slicing and dicing them with steel swords and bayonets. This training in killing enemy soldiers has been going on for a long time. Even the island's residents have been directly instructed by the military in bayonet techniques, rigorously trained with bamboo spears. With the entire island of Okinawa becoming a fortress, and with such elite troops and islanders, it will certainly not fall into enemy hands easily. Moreover, there will be fierce typhoons in Okinawa in April, May, and June, so the opportunity to annihilate the enemy is before our eyes.

<h3>A Perspective on the European War Situation</h3>
<p>The European war situation in the past week has shifted rapidly, centered around the Battle of Berlin. Notable aspects include the Soviet encirclement of Berlin, the meeting of British, American, and Soviet forces on the Elbe River, and the changes in the northern Italian war situation, with Allied forces occupying cities such as Genoa. However, on the whole, the strategic significance of all these tactical movements for the entire European war is not as significant as most observers imagine. We should point out that these tactical movements have caused the European war situation to enter a new phase, but we should also point out that these movements do not mean the end of the European War.</p>
<p>First, looking at the battle for Berlin, the anti-Axis forces harbor an ambition for a quick victory, hoping to realize the meeting of British, American, and Soviet forces in Berlin, as decided at the Crimea Conference, and occupy it with a tripartite control commission. However, this plan has not yet been realized. British and American troops are still far from Berlin. With an unwavering determination to seize it, the Soviet army is advancing on a large scale, throwing 1.5 million troops from the two major fronts of Byelorussia and Ukraine into the fire pit of Berlin. In the overall strategy of the Allied nations, it is certainly not necessarily the final success, because it is questionable whether the Soviet army can make concessions to the British and Americans after suffering heavy sacrifices. Even from the Soviet army's strategy alone, the actual value of such a heavy sacrifice, and the adjustment and replenishment of forces on other fronts in the future, are also major problems. Moreover, the German forces in Berlin are still resisting, determined to shed their last drop of blood for the capital and never surrender.</p>
<p>Second, looking at the southern German front, although British, American, and Soviet troops have achieved a meeting, both sides are tired. On the front lines, there are many disputes over the division of operational areas and cooperation between the three armies; in the rear, German "Werewolf" units and the like are launching guerrilla warfare everywhere in the occupied areas. The anti-Axis forces that have penetrated deep into Germany may inevitably discover a day when they "cannot come back." As for the war situation in northern Italy, since the anti-Axis forces reached the banks of the Po River some time ago, rebels have occupied cities in Milan, Genoa, and other places, which of course cannot be counted as a victory for the anti-Axis forces. Moreover, northern Italy is mountainous and densely forested, and future operations will tend to be protracted.</p>
<p>Third, looking at the entire European war situation, the anti-Axis forces have had their forces divided everywhere in northern Italy, the German-Austrian region, and western and northern Germany. In each region, they must retain a large number of troops in order to maintain their occupation. Moreover, because the German people in the occupied areas are all long-trained and resist the enemy anytime and anywhere, the anti-Axis forces must continue to pay a large amount of supplies to support the occupation of these areas. Therefore, the anti-Axis forces must continue to pay a huge war effort to Europe, and their own power will inevitably weaken day by day. Even if a political and strategic split does not occur immediately among the three countries, their future is hardly optimistic.</p>
<p>Conversely, Germany, in the current situation of the enemy's deep penetration, has not shown signs of discouragement. Even if Berlin is occupied, the Germans will never lay down their weapons. Germany still has almost one-third of its territory, continues to maintain industrial zones with considerable combat power, coasts and harbors, and allies such as Denmark and Norway, and still has the conditions to persist in the war, making the enemy pay a double price for every inch of land. Therefore, it is too early to say that the European war situation is about to end.</p>
<p>As the European war situation enters a new phase, two points are particularly noteworthy: First, because the European war cannot be resolved quickly, the Crimea Conference strategy of the British, American, and Soviet nations can be said to have largely broken down, and the leaders of the three countries will inevitably gather again to discuss a new global strategy. Second, because the British, American, and Soviet nations must continue to pay war efforts to the occupied areas in Europe in order to maintain their occupation, no one can withdraw a large number of troops to other theaters. If the British and Americans want to withdraw troops to the East Asian theater, it is not even a possibility at this time. Not only that, but they must also continue to supply supplies from their own countries to maintain the occupied areas.</p>
<p>The entire world war situation is not trending towards an end, but towards a protracted war. Only those who can complete the total mobilization of the nation, concentrate all physical and mental strength on the decisive battle, can win the final victory. This is the direction in which we East Asian people should strive together today. Our country and people, in particular, should eliminate all illusions, face reality, and strengthen our struggle!</p>

Soviet forces are advancing in the Stettin area, and American and French forces are advancing towards Munich. It is reported that Soviet forces are crossing the German fortresses in the north, attempting to meet with the British Second Army southeast of Hamburg. The distance between them is now within 130 kilometers. Soviet forces are also advancing along an 80-kilometer front towards Germany's Baltic ports, their direct target clearly being Rostock. The left flank of the northern Soviet forces is closing off the northern German fortress area, advancing towards the area where Marshal Zhukov's tank spearhead is located. On Saturday, the Soviet military announced that it had occupied Pasewalk, 40 kilometers west of Stettin, Strasburg, 20 kilometers west of it, and Ducherow, 15 kilometers north of it. Allied forces have cleared the Bremen area. Eisenhower announced yesterday that German forces are launching fierce attacks on Canadian forces in front of Wilhelmshaven and Emden.

<h3>US Fifth Army Reaches Swiss Border in Northern Italy</h3>
<p>Zurich, 29th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to news from Rome last night, the US Fifth Army has reached the Swiss border, dividing northern Italy into two sections. US forces are advancing from the west of Lake Garda and have reportedly entered Como. Their tank units are advancing towards Milan in two directions, so it is reported that Milan will be occupied soon. It is reported that US forces are approaching the city of Bergamo (50 kilometers northeast of Milan), and the important airfield near the city is also reported to have been occupied. The Milan radio station, controlled by rebels, claims that Turin has been liberated.</p>
<h3>Europe on the Hunger Line</h3>
<p>Due to the extreme shortage of food, all parts of Europe are issuing distressed groans, especially in the occupied countries. These countries—namely France, Netherlands, Belgium, Greece, etc.—are trapped in a state of deep hunger, pregnant with a very terrible crisis.</p>
<p>France's Food Shortage</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the situation in France first. According to the Reuters Paris dispatch of March 21st, Parisians have not been able to obtain a drop of oil for the past three months, and no one has been able to eat a slice of meat in these three weeks; although sugar ration coupons have been issued this week, it is still not possible to buy it. Citizens say that they fear that even bread will be gone in the near future. Most French families have been relying on cabbage and small amounts of potatoes to fill their stomachs for the past three months. The milk needed daily for infants, mothers, and patients in Paris is at least 500,000 liters, but the actual milk produced is less than 300,000 liters. Seven months after France was occupied, it has encountered the biggest food crisis since the start of the war. In order to overcome this increasingly deep and widespread hunger crisis, extraordinary measures are absolutely necessary. But worse, the current situation does not show any light in future predictions.</p>
<p>To endure this insufferable pain of food shortages, 5,000 women in Paris held a demonstration on March 20th, parading in formation. This situation is not limited to Paris, and has also affected major cities such as Lyon, Grenoble, and Annemasse. The tense state of domestic political affairs in France at that time was due in part to this.</p>
<p>Belgium and the Netherlands</p>
<p>The situation in Belgium is similar to that in France, but the current situation in the Netherlands is even worse. The Netherlands has not only suffered from war, but also from floods due to the implementation of flood tactics, and the situation is very dangerous. According to the Prime Minister of the Dutch government-in-exile in London, "The Netherlands has insufficient food for the next three months." According to him, Britons can take an average of 2,600 to 3,000 calories of food per day, while the average Dutchman takes less than 700 calories.</p>
<p>Britain Feels Anxious</p>
<p>Comprehensive information from various sources shows that the current nutritional standards in European countries are slightly less than 3,000 calories in Britain, about 500 calories in France and Belgium, and Italy and Norway are also on the verge of the same dangerous state as France. In the face of this terrible food difficulty, Britain is extremely anxious and has become nervous. On March 19th, the British New Statesman and Nation issued the following warning:</p>
<p>"Disappointed European countries will betray Britain and the United States after the war. The war will not end when Germany is defeated, but only when the suffering of Europe's food difficulties is completely eliminated."</p>
<p>The Times also said:</p>
<p>"In the near future, the real enemy of the Allied powers will not be Germany, but the lack of food, clothing, and housing in Europe. Now is the time to seek emergency measures."</p>
<p>Political Confrontation Between Britain and the United States</p>
<p>Due to the complete failure of Britain and the United States to supply food to Europe, they have naturally greatly disappointed European countries. And deep political antagonism has arisen between Britain and the United States as a result, and the tone of Britain and the United States blaming each other is becoming louder and louder. In mid-March, Washington broadcasted: "Britain is storing 700 million tons of food," and claimed: "In order to avoid frustrating the morale of the American public and soldiers, the American food authorities do not intend to further restrict the food of American citizens, so they are considering completely stopping the supply of food to Europe and Britain." The claim that 700 million tons of food was stored greatly astonished the British public. Therefore, Churchill formally stated Britain's position on the 21st of the same month, and tried hard to argue:</p>
<p>"Contrary to what the United States said, Britain's current food reserves are actually less than 6 million tons, and will be further reduced to 4.75 million tons from today to the end of June. This amount is the absolute minimum quantity absolutely necessary to supply the British people under the current rationing system."</p>
<p>On the same day, the London correspondent of the Swiss newspaper further conveyed the British government's public explanation as follows:</p>
<p>"Re-strengthening the restrictions on meat rationing will make the British people and soldiers angry, and in order to maintain the current level, there is no other way but for Britain to completely stop meat exports to Europe."</p>
<p>In short, in response to the attacks from the United States, the British government, through Churchill and Food Minister Lewellyn, argued that "the fact that European countries are on the verge of starvation is not Britain's fault."</p>
<p>Because the US government announced that it would reduce meat supplies to Britain by one-eighth from April, the British government and people were very indignant. This is because the food situation in Europe will be more difficult, and at the same time they know that Americans eat three times more meat than the British public's meat ration.</p>
<p>In addition to meat, other kinds of food are also much more abundant in the United States. For example, the ratio of milk is 49 in Britain and 64 in the United States, chicken is 19 to 28, eggs are 23 to 41, oil is 38 to 44, sugar is 65 to 84, and vegetables are 75 to 206. Another report stated: "Compared to last year's meat ration, British soldiers get 150 pounds, the British get 107 pounds, while American soldiers can get 300 pounds each."</p>
<p>It is true that the US food reserves are slowly decreasing now. Especially in the past few months, it has decreased a lot. But from the perspective of Europeans, it is really not possible to say that there is a lack of food for American citizens in the current situation, just as the current situation in Britain cannot be called wandering on the "hunger line". But the Anglo-American dispute with European hunger as the background is a very important issue in world politics. The deep food situation in Europe, from a political point of view, is a fatal threat to Anglo-American policy now and after the war. In view of this importance, British Deputy Prime Minister Attlee investigated the situation in Europe and made a lively discussion in the House of Commons. And Labour Party leader Greenwood declared on the 29th:</p>
<p>"If Europe is not sufficiently supplied with food now, then the Allied countries will face the biggest problem in history that has never been seen before. This is the biggest historical problem that has never been seen even when the Black Death came to Europe."</p>
<p>Because of Insufficient Ships</p>
<p>The next question that can be thought of is why the United States stopped supplying food to Europe. Stopping the supply is definitely not beneficial to the United States, because hungry Europe is very easy to turn red. Fearing the occurrence of this fact, Britain and the United States drafted a dream plan to try to organize the Allied Relief Committee. The result of this plan was a pipe dream; this is enough to prove that Britain and the United States cannot supply food to Europe.</p>
<p>The United States claims that the recent decline in food production in the United States is entirely due to labor shortages and the prosperity of wartime industry, but in reality, we believe that the fundamental reason is the lack of ships.

<h3>Trade Associations to Establish Registration and Investigation Groups: To Prevent Member Manufacturers from Hoarding Materials</h3>
<p>In order to actively promote economic measures, the Ministry of Industry has not only instructed the competent authorities of various provinces and cities to strengthen the industry trade associations and increase their powers, but also recently instructed the municipal government to instruct the municipal economic bureau to order each industry trade association to establish a registration and investigation group within each industry trade association, so that it can specialize in the investigation and registration of the entry and exit of materials of member manufacturers of each industry trade association. This move has profound significance for preventing hoarding, suppressing prices, and stabilizing people's livelihood. It is learned that after receiving the order, the Municipal Economic Bureau has instructed the competent sections to instruct each industry trade association to comply, and the section is actively studying the working rules of the group in order to provide timely guidance to each industry and to implement it as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Japanese Residents in This City Celebrated the Emperor's Birthday Yesterday</h3>

<h3>After the Authorities Crack Down on Speculation, Finance Will Move Towards the Right Track</h3>
<p>The Industrial and Commercial Market Situation Last Week Was Still Relatively Stable</p>
<p>Since the beginning of this month, the financial market situation in Shanghai has been caused by the tension in the international situation, resulting in fluctuating prices of Shasha bonds and Chinese stocks. Especially speculators took advantage of the opportunity to engage in activities. Therefore, they spread baseless rumors to confuse people and engaged in the usual tricks of absorbing and selling, manipulating market prices to skyrocket and plummet, disrupting the entire financial system. Although the relevant economic agencies of this city were ordered by the National Government to conduct thorough investigations and crackdowns last week, the market situation has not been able to return to its past stable state.</p>
<p>On Monday of last week, the authorities began to strictly inspect financial trading methods. People's minds suddenly softened at that time. The rising price of Shasha bonds stopped, and the price of silver also showed a downward trend. There was little change in the price of public bonds, and the trend of Chinese stocks was uncertain. Popular stocks such as Meyer, Wing On Company, and yarn factories fell sharply and rebounded slightly, but the price of small stocks rose more and fell less, and there were even strange phenomena of several stocks hitting the limit. On Tuesday, the market situation turned small and the base was still stable, but the stock market was sluggish. On Wednesday, the trend turned into a big drop. The falling price of Shasha bonds generally made people feel uneasy. The price of silver suddenly fell by 2,000 yuan. The price of public bonds fell sharply, and the stock market fell sharply due to tight positions. The retail investors of general high-priced stocks were panicked. On Thursday, rumors of some favorable news for the bulls spread again, and people's minds recovered. The market situation was still flat in the morning, and in the afternoon, the price of Shasha bonds turned from falling to rising, and the trend was firm. The price of silver and public bonds also rebounded, and more than 20 kinds of Chinese stocks hit the limit. On Friday, due to looser money, foreign capital suddenly came to absorb heavily, and Shasha also saw a peak again. The rising trend of public bonds and silver was flat, but the rising trend of stocks was even stronger. 90 kinds of popular stocks and small stocks hit the limit, and the goal of most speculators was to transfer to stock trading. On Saturday morning, the overall market seemed to be stabilizing, and Shasha bonds and stocks rose first and then fell back. The prices of public bonds and silver were both flat and low. It is reported that the financial authorities are determined to strictly manage the Shanghai financial market and crack down on illegal transactions, so as to enforce the law and punish illegal speculators. It is expected that the business situation will move towards the right track in the future.</p>
<p>As for the situation of industry and commerce last week, it was still relatively stable. The prices of rice, miscellaneous grains, oil, sugar, and other daily necessities rose and fell very little. This is because transportation has become slightly more convenient than before, and the circulation of materials has become smoother. Under the strict restrictions of the economic authorities, the market price is not easy to raise. However, it is hoped that the relevant authorities will severely investigate and punish illegal merchants who hoard and manipulate market prices, regardless of their class, with a spirit of impartiality, so as to prevent prices from rising for no reason.</p>
<h3>Education Funds for April Released Today</h3>
<p>The Education Bureau finalized the allocation of the city's education funds for April yesterday. Director Dai immediately instructed the relevant personnel to expedite the procedures. The funds are scheduled to be released starting from the 30th, distributed daily according to the distance of each school and institution's location. It is reported that on the 30th, funds will be released to municipal primary and secondary schools, normal schools, and social education institutions in the central, southern, central-northern, and western districts of Shanghai, as well as salaries for Japanese language teachers of Japanese nationality. On May 1st, funds will be released to municipal schools in the northeastern, northwestern, and southeastern districts of Shanghai. On the 2nd, funds will be released to municipal schools in the eastern and northeastern districts of Shanghai. The Bureau has also requested banks to provide cash as much as possible to meet the needs of the schools and institutions. All schools and institutions can prepare the necessary procedures for claiming the funds and arrive at the Bureau on time to claim them. At the same time, Director Dai, wishing to understand the current situation of each school and institution in order to provide specific guidance, will also summon the heads of each institution at that time to inquire about everything.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Friendly Football Match: Football Association Wins Against Referees</h3>
<p>Four to Two, Halftime Tied One to One</p>
<p>The friendly football match between the Football Association and the Referee Team was held at Jiaozhou Park yesterday afternoon at 3 PM. Because both sides were veterans, there were bound to be many tricks, so many people went to watch, and the atmosphere was lively. At first, the referees, led by Dai Linjing, had a strong offensive. Zhang Le shot in the midst of the chaos, but Ma Shan'er kicked the ball to save it. He scored an own goal due to momentary carelessness, with the Referees leading 1-0. The referees continued to attack aggressively, and the situation was tense. Fortunately, Li Ning and Zhuang Youren arrived in time to turn the danger into safety. Meng Nuo went straight in from the side and hit the bullseye, making it 1-1 at the end of the first half. The veteran soldiers were ultimately lacking in endurance. In the second half, both sides adjusted their troops and continued to fight. Zhang Le missed a sure shot. The Football Association's luck turned for the better, and Ma Shan'er scored. However, during that time, Wu Shouheng, in a moment of desperation, used his hand to save the ball and knocked it out of bounds. A Dai enforced the law strictly and ruled it as a lost goal, making it 2-1 to the Football Association. Afterwards, Huang Fengzhu advanced his troops in the middle and attacked the enemy's stronghold, making it 2-2 again, a tie game. Ma Shan'er overcame obstacles and scored, making it 3-2 to the Football Association again. Then, referee team's E Sen fouled Shen Siliang at the 20-yard mark. Zhuang Youren scored. After that, the referee team repeatedly moved their troops in an attempt to turn the tide, but the Football Association's defense was impregnable, and they ultimately failed. As a result, the Football Association defeated the referees 4-2, avenging last year's defeat.</p>
<p>Football Association: Zhou Jiaqi, Li Ning, Jie Laiti, Qian Weilie (off), Le Xiurong, Zhuang Youren, Jiang Yimen (on), Le Xiurong, Meng Nuo, Xuan Zhengzhu, Shen Siliang, Ma Shan'er, Cheng Yize, Si Tugen.</p>

<h3>Investigation of Huangpu Baojia District</h3>
<p>— Liu Feng</p>
<p>The area covered by the Huangpu Baojia District is: bounded by the Huangpu River to the east, Shanxi Road to the west, the boundary of the South City to the south, and the Suzhou River to the north. The district was originally named the Central Baojia District. After adding the Fifth Joint Bao of the former French Concession's Mailan District and the Sixth Joint Bao of Xiaodongmen in July of the 33rd year [of the Republic], it was renamed the current name. The district currently has six joint baos, forty-eight baos, seven hundred and ninety-eight jia, with a total population of approximately 110,000. The chief of the joint bao is Mr. Wu Yunzhai, and the deputy chiefs of the joint bao are Mr. Shao Leping and Mr. Xiang Shengwu.</p>
<p>The Huangpu District has always been a model baojia district. Its location is extremely important, as it is the essence of Shanghai's financial and commercial activities. The baojia work is carried out most smoothly (March 1st of the 31st year [of the Republic]), the uniforms of the police corps are the most complete, and the air defense training is the strictest. Moreover, the entire district is densely covered with police sirens, with installations at every intersection, totaling sixty-four. The joint bao office has six red lights connected to these sirens, and the police bureau has sixty-four red lights connected to them. In the event of an emergency, they light up immediately and take the necessary measures. In the past, when terrorist incidents occurred, the entire area was sealed off, which was too extensive and caused inconvenience to pedestrians. Now it has been changed to a joint bao blockade, which is much smaller in scope and more convenient for pedestrians.</p>
<p>The baojia district's baojia dues are collected as follows: 50 yuan for attached households, 100 yuan per month for second landlords, 200 yuan for shops with one storefront, 400 yuan for two storefronts, 600 yuan for three storefronts, and 5,000 yuan for monthly baojia dues for factories, banks, and major businesses, with the highest being 20,000 yuan. The total monthly baojia fee is approximately 3,380,000 yuan. Twenty percent is given to the baojia office, and the rest is used for staff salaries, air defense equipment, and stationery and printing. Currently, the joint bao office has a monthly expenditure of 145,000 yuan, each joint bao has a monthly expenditure of 25,000 yuan, and each bao has a monthly expenditure of 15,000 yuan. The joint bao office currently has two staff members and two messengers. Their monthly salaries are only 32,000 yuan, and they cannot enjoy the rights to priority rice and low-price rice because they are an intermediary agency and have an independent nature, receiving no subsidies from anywhere. Requests for salary increases have not been approved, and they cannot increase fees to the businesses below, so the lives of their staff are very difficult.</p>
<h3>C Group Football Finals: Xuanhui and Hualun Make Peace</h3>
<p>The C Group football final round-robin match between Xuanhui and Hualun was held at Jiaozhou Park yesterday afternoon at 4:30. The first half ended without any scores. After the restart, Hualun's Liu Zuru scored a direct goal from a corner kick. Not long after, Xuanhui's Xu Deming equalized the score. When the regular time ended, each team had scored one goal, sharing the spoils. During the 30-minute overtime, both teams failed to achieve their wishes. The C Group championship will be re-determined at a later date.</p>
<h3>B Group Basketball League</h3>
<p>There were two B group Basketball League games yesterday. [Name of] Team forfeited, Nan You won without effort. In the other game, Qi Ren played against Da Peng. As a result, Qi Ren lost to Da Peng 27-21. Today's schedule is as follows: He De - Xin Lian (B1) at 4:30, You Bing - Lan Dui (B6) at 5:15.</p>
<h3>A Visit to the Wreckage of an Enemy Plane in Pudong</h3>
<p>— Qichang</p>
<p>The day before yesterday (28th) at around 11 PM, two enemy B-29 type aircraft entered the airspace over this city. One of them invaded Shanghai from the southwest, flying low over the city area, and was immediately surrounded by Japanese searchlight beams. It was then hit and caught fire. Because it was too close to the ground, the people in the plane could not jump out and crashed to the ground, landing in a wheat field in the Xijiazhai area of Shengjiahang in Pudong. The nearby residents and houses were not damaged.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the reporter went to the crash site to see it in person. There were several people traveling with me. We boarded a small motorboat from the Tianjin Road Wharf, diagonally crossing the Huangpu River to the naval pier in Pudong. There were already trucks full of destroyed plane fragments being unloaded there. Machine gun bullets were being placed in baskets. There were also many charred pistols. The machine guns dragged out of the broken plane had turned completely black and charred, and the muzzle openings were filled with mud. In the pile of scrap metal, there were also pieces of torn clothing, cotton wadding, burlap, wireless radio parts, gas mask parts, scraps of paper, identification cards, maps, astronomical charts, food cans, medicine, and instructions for wound treatment.</p>
<p>The reporter and others climbed onto the truck carrying the debris and drove straight to Shengjiahang. The wind and sand were extremely heavy along the way, and the truck was constantly jolting. After about a quarter of an hour, we arrived at our destination. The truck stopped by the road, and after walking more than a hundred steps into the wheat field, we reached the place where the plane crashed. The coolies were carrying the debris, and dozens of soldiers were digging out the bombs that were embedded in the ground. There were two of these bombs lined up together, still unexploded, with a diameter of about one and a half feet and a height of more than four feet above the ground. According to a certain sergeant, each bomb weighed at least 500 pounds. Next to them was another exploded bomb, with a shell about one inch thick.</p>
<p>Most of the American pilots' bodies were completely burned, fragmented and broken. The flesh under the white skin had not yet congealed, and the fishy smell was overwhelming. Onlookers covered their noses. Their hands and feet were still discernible, but they were already swollen like boxing gloves. Another body had only the middle section, and the head and limbs were missing. There were eight or nine other corpses with bloody flesh, all incomplete. Several corpses still had plane parts inserted into the mud and were being excavated. These Americans were either pilots, radio operators, gunners, observers, or guides. Their cause of death was either burning to death in the air, being blown up by the bombs they carried after falling, or being killed by the fall. The total number was about thirteen or fourteen people, none of whom survived. This was all because they were flying too low and did not have time to use parachutes.</p>
<p>There was also an airplane wheel standing on the ground, reaching a height of seven or eight feet, with a rubber tire of about two feet in diameter. The rubber tire of another wheel had been burned away, leaving only the wheel disc and axle. There were four engines, scattered in several places, all burned and incomplete. The blades of the propeller were about three feet long and about one foot wide, painted a tender green color, which was very pleasing to the eye. There was also an oil tank that had been broken, but the partitions in the middle of the tank could still be faintly seen. Its size was as large as a small boat. It was estimated that it could hold at least five or six hundred gallons of oil.</p>
<p>According to nearby farmers, after the plane was shot down, a fire broke out in the sky, and then it crashed to the ground with a deafening explosion, as if the sky had fallen and the earth had split. Then there were a series of explosions, with more than a dozen fires breaking out on the ground, which lasted for a long time. The residents did not know what to do and could only resign themselves to fate. When the reporter visited, it was nearly noon, and there were still one or two places where the residual smoke had not completely dissipated.</p>

<h3>Hoping That Wealthy Merchants Respond to Hidden Poverty Loan Fund</h3>
<p>I am a salaried worker whose income is not enough to support my parents or raise my children. I have many children, and the number of mouths to feed is large. Today, I saw in the newspaper that the Yuzhai owner is organizing a hidden poverty loan fund. I was deeply moved by this benevolent and righteous act. In this time of turbulent times and declining morality, the human heart is becoming more dangerous! The masses are competing for windfall profits. Those with long sleeves are good at dancing, manipulating and hoarding goods, and in the blink of an eye, they acquire tens of millions of assets. With profit in their hearts, where is benevolence? Those who are content and abide by the law, live in hidden poverty and high integrity, suffer hardships, endure hunger and cold, or even wander around the house in distress, looking up at the roof and sighing. Who will pity them, comfort them, and relieve them? Now the owner of Yuzhai has kindness in his heart and is determined to do good, organizing a hidden poverty loan fund, which is truly a beacon in the sea of suffering. There is no shortage of wealthy merchants in Shanghai, and some of them may be moved by this and rise up to follow suit. Only those who accumulate wealth can distribute it, and only those who distribute wealth will ultimately accumulate it. This is truly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to practice benevolence.

<p>Picking Up and Donating Money for a Charity School</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Shusen wrote a letter saying: "Last month, I picked up a lost savings check for 1,000 yuan that a flour customer lost. Now that I see that your place is establishing a charity school, I will add another 1,000 yuan to make a total of 2,000 yuan, which will be used as the "Charity School Fund". A small amount, but it expresses my feelings."</p>
<h3>Report on Charity School Fund Donations</h3>
<p>Zhang Shusen: 2,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Research on the Non-Toxic Bactericidal Agent "Neo-Penicillin"</h3>
<p>Since the advent of sulfonamide derivatives, scientists around the world have been researching effective non-toxic bactericidal agents. Professor Fleming of the University of London discovered in 1929 a product of [Penicillium] notatum that is non-toxic and has a particularly strong antibacterial effect, which is the recently popular penicillin. This new drug was initially popular in England and the United States, and later adopted by the medical and pharmaceutical circles of various countries around the world, gradually becoming more popular than sulfonamide preparations. However, this antibacterial substance is produced in very small quantities, and its properties are very unstable, making it very difficult to refine and concentrate. The antibacterial potency limit of ordinary therapeutic "penicillin" can only be diluted to one million times, containing a large amount of unrefined impurities. Injections often have side effects such as pain, fever, and thrombosis. In 1942, British scholars Abraham and Chain, etc., invented a new preparation called "Neo-Penicillin," which is far purer than ordinary "penicillin." Even diluted to twenty million times, it can still fully exert its antibacterial power. According to experimental results, its ability to inhibit bacterial growth is hundreds of times greater than sulfonamides. It has strong solubility and is easily dispersed. Its difference from sulfonamides is that its activity is not limited by blood or pus, and it has no toxic effects on tissue cells and white blood cells. Since the successful manufacture of "Neo-Penicillin," all [other] penicillin preparations have paled in comparison. This is not only a matter of purity but also the standard and accuracy of the units cannot be compared. Therefore, "Neo-Penicillin" products have begun to be universally advocated by the medical and pharmaceutical circles.</p>
<p>This agent mainly treats various diseases caused by infections with Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Gonococcus, and Pneumococcus, as well as meningitis, diphtheria, empyema, syphilis, osteomyelitis, sepsis, puerperal fever, tetanus, scarlet fever, erysipelas, ulcers, gas gangrene, and all kinds of trauma, frostbite, burns, etc., all responding like an echo, with the disease disappearing with the medicine. It is undoubtedly a modern all-around chemical therapeutic agent. However, this agent cannot be stored for a long time. Only when stored in German-made yellow "Jena" ampoules will it not denature over time. Therefore, the refining technology and the preservation equipment have a great impact on the effect, which is not a small matter. It is said that there has recently been a Chinese-made "Neo-Penicillin" preparation on the market in this city. Its excellent performance meets the conditions that should be met by world academic students. Clinical experiments are quite satisfactory. Its contribution to the well-being of patients is not small.
