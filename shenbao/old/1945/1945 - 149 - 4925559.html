<h3>沖繩附近中城灣方面　沉毀艦船十一艘　日航空部隊夜間總攻戰果</h3>
<p>前綫基地二十八日中央社電　日航空部隊策應交烈空挺部隊之作職，自二十七日深夜至二十八日拂曉，又以雷繫隊，特攻隊及重轟炸朦，對集合於冲繩附近中城灣方面企圖新行動之敵艦船隊，開始總攻擊，給果擊沉敵大型運輪船三艘，巡洋艦二艘，戰艦一艘，並重創大型攫輸船一艘，中型運輪船一艘，艦樂不祥者三艘。又陸軍襲擊隊及海軍重轟炸隊，則排除敵方夜間戰鬥機之邀擎，襲擊伊江島，而控制該島機塲，是役日機未歸還者僅一架。</p>
<p>里斯本二十八日中央社電　據合眾計自火富島美軍基地來電稱，有力之日本「空中艦隊」，自二十四日至二十五日前後，約歷十八小時，對冲繩島四周美國太平洋艦隊猛加攻擊，傳有艦船十一艘蒙受損害。</p>
<p>那霸附近丘陵變色美方發表海軍損失</p>
<p>里斯本二十八日中央社電　紐約先馴論壞報記者，二十四日發表關於自仲繩前綫基地至那　附近之激戰情形如次：因於數週來之砲擊，該處丘陵地帶已爲之變色。美軍職車葬身於泥窟，連接斜面西北部之廣泛原野，散滿美海軍陸戰隊倉卒潰退時拋棄之鋼盔，水壸及其他裝備。又丘陵西側泥濘道上，美軍戰車與水陸兩用載震車之殘體到處可見，均係被日軍砲火所擊破者。</p>
<p>里斯本二十八日中央社電　據關島來電，尼米資司令部發表稱：自開始沖繩作戰以來，海軍死傷者三萬五千一百十六名。又據華盛頓電訊，美海軍部發表，在仲縄島方面，美馴逐艦立脫號及其他艦艇四艘，爲日軍擊沉，立脫號甫於去年五月進水，爲兩千噸級精銳艦。</p>
<h3>各地戰況</h3>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電　本週內戰况如次：　琉球舉為冲繩戰鬥，自入本週益形劇烈，變方陸海空之血戰，依舊繼續中。自十九日以來，敵增援兵力後，再度發動大攻勢，因之，由東海岸至西海岸，展開全綫激戰，尤以東海岸方面，二十五日敵一帶，但經日力加以反攻，尤以與那原西北方之猛攻，敵軍之犧牲，其數更大。他方如中央首里方面，西海岸，那關前方地區，雖一再熾烈進攻，但日東部隊之反攻奏效，敵軍企圖奪取日陣地重點，僅於眞嘉比附近稍有前進，侵入那霸市東方附近一部敵兵，亦被擊退至安呈附近。敵以第九十六師，第七師，第七十七師，海軍第一師，第六師，全部五師兵力，以戰車爲前騙，運日不斷攻擊，只見共　　加重，而進展之速度反較論週爲遲緩。十八日敵之死傷，約五萬二千七百名，戰車擱置焚燬五頁六十五輛，若加入其後損害，則僅陸上戰鬥即巳突破六萬名。日軍特別攻擊隊及航空部隊，呼應陸上部隊之勇敢戰鬥，敵艦船羣及本島北·中兩飛機塲與伊江島飛機塲，熾烈攻擊，二十四日夜，義烈空挺隊强行於冲縄本島之北·中兩飛機塲降陸，奪取停留地上之敵機及飛機塲各種設施，使敵陣容全陷於混亂，爆炸處所達一百五十餘處。　南方基地之B29型機，自四月中旬以來，爲牽制日機對沖繩之攻擊，乃舉其自力，竭力對日基地實行戰術轟炸，最近又對主要都市强行戰略轟炸，十四，十七兩日，對名古屋大舉夜間轟炸後，二十三，二十五兩夜，復各以B29型機二百五十架來襲東京，加以燒夷彈攻擊，二十三，五兩日之邀擊戰果，計擊落七十四架。　緬甸戰綫因日方整備戰略陣勢，同時敵亦竭力整備戰線，在雨期之前，漸呈對峙情形，除於揮部高原地區及附近戰塲之激戰外，戰局尚無多大變化，而敵由後方樂續增强兵力，其企圖不容輕視。</p>
<h3>軍事評論家談　沖繩最近戰況　日決奮鬥到底爭取勝利</h3>
<p>中央社訊　滬市軍事評論家就最近冲繩島職况觀察，敵軍進展阻礙，損害綦重。在冲縄南部戰錢，從那霸經首里至與那原一錢，刻仍繼績激戰。自二十四日以來，日美兩軍在安里川作戰熾烈，敵在該地南部獲取橋頭堡後，再三蠢動，每次均遭日軍擊潰，至今仍未放棄其企圖，不斷侵擾。最近敵在安里川又舖設橋梁，惟日軍已自二十五日晚起猛擊敵人，結果予敵重創，該處河內敵屍漂浮，敵雖最後在安里川再舖設橋橋二座，企圖侵攻那霸，自二十四之後，遭遇大雨泛濫影響，將敵在安里川所舖之橋樑四座冲去其三。冲縄島中部擊况，園繞首里之敵海軍第一師團及陸軍七七師團。九六師團，其中第一師團與九六師團稍有進展，似企圖侵攻首里。東部戰綫有敵第七師團及九六師團之一部份，其第七師團進展遲緩，九六師團則擬圍繞與那原企圓。敵在此役中，平均爲時一月，僅前進二三海里，敵之軍事指導官及報道方面均有明白之透示。</p>
<p>美方承認作戰困難</p>
<p>據二十八日舊金山廣播：仲縄合眾社戰地記者華倫士發表，最近一月以來，美軍在冲繩之作戰，遭受理想上之困難，在前綫僅進三哩。　氏並稱，本人曾他往，費時僅四星期，返歸時目見公路機塲坩加，惟美兵力如奮。渦去雖有一般樂觀者之許論，稱美軍即可攻佔首里及進佔那霸，至今那號未佔，首里仍在外圍，此悽烈之前綫作戰結果，首里無綫電台仍在日軍掌握，其作職成果已可見一斑。查在七星期之前，美軍已目見該電臺頗近，而一般現實派之美軍已向記者稱，此項作戰須在六月杪可吿一段落，在前綫之美將士，深認產肼滬緩及激戰之慘烈，同時一般陸軍之指揮官，認對日軍守衛隊作正面攻擊，不啻爲自殺行動，至少耗損美軍之大半，故預算美軍之前進，費一月之代價，僅有二海里半，在今後之行動上當頗困難云云。</p>
<p>日軍予敵嚴重打擊</p>
<p>該軍事評論家稱，據海上作戰方面之日報道班員謂，日本特攻大編隊已向敵作立體之攻擊，尚有義烈特攻隊予敵嚴重打擊，並　復敵方之各種設備。根據敵方發表，曾發出緊急警報達八小時。我人根據以上情形窺測，將來仲繩島戰局，敵困難重重，尤其補給綫之遙長，更無法維持。深倌今後敵對日軍之可能戰法，爲職略之轟炸，前敵第八航空隊司令杜立德爾再度任命該職，按杜在一九四二年曾擔任首次空襲日本之使命，此人爲中型之轟炸專門家，但以其名家之觀測，決難成大器。據美國外經濟調查局長格勞萊於最近發表談話稱，「日軍之戰力強大，在長期戰中實力充沛，而在日本內地及台灣朝鮮滿洲華北，均有豐富物資蘊藏，並稱目前難有「解放」之地，但對一九四一年日本所佔領之荷印·東印度·馬來·非律實之面積三百萬平方哩，猶不足百分之七。同時日本各工廠已作戰時疏散，國內始終　有大量物资，並充分發展生產」。我人可見日本作戰力量之强大，今後當廣績作戰，使敵遭受絕對之困難。最近舊金山倫敦各方面散佈護言稱，日本經蘇聯之調解向英美談和，絕非事實，查英美已自知作戰困難，造謠滋事，日本最高首腦部一再披瀝決奮戰到底，獲取最後光榮之勝利。</p>
<h3>敵機廿一架　侵襲武漢</h3>
<p>漢口二十八日中央社電　二十七日上午十時，駐渝美空軍B29型機九架。P51型機三架。P38型機九架來襲武漢，於武漢東北地區投彈後，向西北方遁去，地上損害甚重。</p>
<h3>菲島仍有激戰</h3>
<p>里斯本二十八日中央社電據菲島前綫美軍戰報稱，呂宋方面仍有最激烈戰事。</p>
<h3>東京水電交通　均恢復常態　九州墜毀敵機十二架</h3>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電　敵機於二十三日夜迄二十四日拂曉來襲之後，二十五日夜半B29型機又來猛襲，因此暴舉，東京之損害確實甚重，電車，電燈，自來水等，皆曾一度停止，至夜問電燈已復明，自來水亦同時復舊，而一般電話自二十六日下午起，亦大致開始通話，交通機關之電車與地下鐵道，自二十七日傍晚起，已完全復舊。</p>
<p>福岡二十八日中央社電　南方基地之敵B29型機十二架，二十八馴黎明來襲博多灤及關門地區，投下機雷，日制空部隊猛烈迎擊，計擊落四架，其中二架未證實，又擊毀者八架。</p>
<h3>京漢慶祝　日海軍節　舉行電影演講會</h3>
<p>南京二十八日中央社電　二十七日爲盟邦日本第四十屆海軍紀念日，值茲大東亞戰爭迫近決勝階段之際，其意義至爲深長。國府宣傳部爲慶祝起見，特於二十八日上午九時半假大華大戲院，樂行電影演講大會，出席有海軍部次長李懸滋。宣傳部特種宣傳司長丁超及京市靑少年，民衆等二千餘人，行禮如儀後，首由丁特種宣傳司長報告慶祝盟邦日本海軍節之意義，略謂，吾人現慶祝盟邦日本海軍之輝煌戰果，更應努力加緊本國之海軍建設。繼由海軍部次長李　濟演講，就日木海軍節之意義及目下吾人應努力之處，詳加闡述。迄十時許始畢。旋放映日本電影「熱風」</p>
<p>漢口二十八日中央社電　此間海軍報道部曁武漢宜傳聯盟，昨爲慶祝日海軍節，特樂行電影演講大會。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>現階段之中日協力</h3>
<p>中日協力，無論爲戰時及戰後，無論爲兩國政府或民間，都已久成定諭，有如天經地義，時至今日，應已毋須再提，而是切實實踐和收獲成果的時候了。可是，這不是說中日協力已經實施得如何令人滿意，相反的，彼此之問難免還有未盡未善之處。我們認爲中日協力，在原則上，在理論上，現在已經毋須再談了，但是在實踐上，爲求完善與　澈，我們仍應坦白的提出，互相研究改進，「諱疾忌醫」的態度，更是萬萬要不得的。</p>
<p>我們相信，日本方面對此也有同感。在這大東亞戰局日趨嚴震的現階段，對於中日協力問題，日本朝野近來更表示非常重視，如本月十九·二十兩日，東京曾舉行大陸連絡會議；東鄉外相兼大東亞相爲與駐華各使節洽商對華政策之運營起見，又於本月二十一日舉行駐華大使館事務所長會議。東鄉氏在其訓詞中，特別指出「隨着時局的進展，日本對華問題之重要性益形擴大，日本除援助中國之統一及完成其自主獨立外，並於政治方面求平等，經濟方面求互惠，確立中日問之親善關係。日本必須克服一切障害，藉蔪實現其根本方針，蓋此與日本克服當前難關具有密切關係」，道是何等明朗坦白的闡示！到了本月二十八日，又在近衛文麼公爵領導之下創設日華協會，藉以强化提携促巡親善，增强中日協力關係。很顯然的，其動機是和東鄉外相兼大東亞相所宜示者，有互相呼應的意義。</p>
<p>從我們中國民眾的立塲來說，有如上文所述，我們不應再講原則和理諭，我們希望大家坦坦白白，實事求是，去實踐中日協力的原則和理諭，我們在今天決沒有人可以說，對於這種原則和理論，尚有徘徊瞻顯的餘地。同時，我們也不能諱言，有些人，對於道些原則和理論，口是心非，陽奉陰遠，以致在中日協力的實踐上，大家都遭遇到意想以外的困難。不過我們東方民族的特性，是不畏　困難的，愈是困難，愈要努力。我們於今日之中日協力問題，大家都應有這種堅强的信念。</p>
<p>中國人民在現階段言中日協力，認爲最主要的就在置重點於兩國當前實際問題之解決。就我國說，今日問題之最實際最嚴重者，只是民生疾苦問題。所以我們認爲，要促進中日協力，在今日首先要求解救中國民生疾苦問題，只有在這一個問題獲得解決，才談得到其他更高的原則和理諭；其實，也只有在實事求是地解決中國民生疾苦之中，才可開始表現出中日協力的眞價值。目前嚴重萬分的民食問題，就是最好的測騐。固然，這是一個複雜而困難的問題，但是，誰都很明白，只要中日燮方責任當局相互拿出誠意和實力來，在變方小我的抑制及忍耐心之下，這個嚴重的問題是有解決可能的！這一條路打通了，則全部中日協力問題，不怕今日怎樣陰晦，也有豁然開朗的希望和必然！</p>
<p>我們始終認爲中日協力之實踐與完遂，當從適合燮方國情民情把握兩國民心爲基本方向，而對於中國民眾，在現階段最迫急的踝題，就是以適合中國國情民情的方法解救中國民生的疾苦。我們希望大家以克己忍耐和加借的努力，來表現對於中日協力的眞誠。</p>
<h3>中央黨部　舉行週會</h3>
<p>南京二十八日中央社電　中國國民黨中央黨部，二十八日上午十時在該部大禮堂，舉行總理紀念週，到中央執監委員。各所部會工作同志，政府機關。國民黨黨員六百餘人，由塲委員揆一主席，行禮如儀後，並報告最近國際情勢至爲詳盡，至十一時許禮成散會。</p>
<h3>陳母衛太夫人　在京仙逝</h3>
<p>南京二十八日中央社電　汪故主席之岳母，陳繼祖·陳　君·陳舜貞·陳昌祖之母衛太夫人，於二十七日下午十時五十分在京仙逝，二十八日下午三時在頤和路三十九號本宅大殮，國府各機關長官亦紛往弔唁，自晨至暮達千餘人。按陳母衛太夫人於國父在南洋時，曾竭力協助，對革命工作頗多貢獻，當汪故主席倡導和運時，亦深爲贊許，蓋其以爲非和平不足以解人民痛苦也。氏平素身體尚健，性極溫和，惟素有糖尿病，本月二十五日忽感氣喘，後施以氧氣治療法，乃漸復常態，二十七日晚猶談笑自若，但至十時許忽感背痛無力，至十時五十分心脈停止活動，即吿仙逝，享年七十七歲。</p>
<h3>美機生產減少</h3>
<p>里斯本二十八日中央社電　據華盛頓訊：美陸軍部宣佈，今後一年半期間內，美國飛機生產將激減至一萬七千架。</p>
<h3>司法部吳部長　報吿工作槪況　革餘積弊注意監獄衛生</h3>
<p>南京二十八日中央社電　司法部行政部今日下午三詩定例會見中外新聞記者，由該部長吳頌皋氏親臨主持，對該部歷來之工作概况，撮要報告如下：　本人於就任之初，即通令所屬各級院署長官，對於所屬推槍嚴加稽察，其有廢弛職務，或操行有虧者，隨時據實呈報，以憑議處外，對於各院署民刑事報司案件，亦飭主管司科詳爲審核，如有辦案玩忽之承辦人員，一經查實決予嚴懲。最近發見各級推槍中，辦案玩忽者先後數起，業將承辦人員分別予以記過或撤職之處分。　國府本年頭布大赦條例，本部奉令後，即轉飾所屬各級院署遵照，對於應行赦免之人犯，務須迅速依法開釋，其應改刑之案件，亦須於文到二月內一律辦竣，現在辦理光竣之院署，將辦理情形及裁定列表呈部請核者巳有多處。　監獄作業及衛生關係，均極重要，前經一再通飭改善在案，嗣復於上月問飾派監獄司司長前往首都及鎖。常。蘇。錫各地監所視察，並對作業衛生及管理方面，予以現地之指導，據視察所得結果，以鎭江監獄辦理最有可觀。　本人爲改善上海監獄所衛生，籌募醫藥基金，特親自赴滬，於本月十八日下午三時假上海康樂酒樓舉行茶會，邀請各致踴躍認募，此項捐款，在本月底即可收齊，擬就地設立保管委員會負責保管，以期憂得適當之支配，而收改善監所衛生之實效。　民法債編及票據法，關於科率之規定，核與現在社會經濟情形頗不適合，迭舉各銀錢同業公會呈請救濟，業由本部定一戰時利率暫行辦法，呈準公布施行。</p>
<p>又訊，近日以物價高漲，故於每月囚糧所需費用，亦呈收支不敷狀態，每月須墊款四千萬元，司法行政部吳部長於廿八日特往財政部　洽增加槪算，期能維持現狀，以便犯罪者獲得合理之待遇，刻該事正在進行洽商中。</p>
<h3>武漢軍政機關　業務會議</h3>
<p>澳口二十八日中央社電　葉省長爲切實促成各機關部隊加強工作，特規定每週舉行武漢軍政機關業務會議，今晨爲第一次樂行之期，十時各機關部隊之重要高級人員，均齊集物華館，席問由葉省長詳爲指示應注意各點，最後由出席人員報告各該所屬概况。</p>
<h3>渝方召開　六屆中執會</h3>
<p>廣州二十八日中央社電　據重慶廣播：渝方繼六全大會之後，於二十八日舉行第六屆中央執行委員大會第一次全體會議，此次會議係討論國民參政會未獲結果之選舉國民大會代表及憲法草案等問題。</p>
<p>廣州二十八日中央社電　此次渝六全大會，決定將三民主義靑年團由國民黨機關改爲直屬行政院。據三十六日震慶廣播稱，召開中央幹事臨時全體大會，開於改屬行政院問題曾讓起爭論。</p>
<h3>英國工黨　發表政綱　總選競爭堪注目</h3>
<p>中央社訊　據滬市方面所悉，英勞工黨所主張之政綱如下：　關於外交方面，（甲）全面協助太平洋作戰，（乙）在美英蘇法渝間，保持最緊密協力，根據所具有防制侵略意義和權力之世界機構，以爲集團之安全保障，且絕對排除煽動小國壓制大國。　國際通商問題，（甲）協力國際經濟，（乙）排除限制生產者或爲個人利益而引起物資匱乏之國際企業活動，（丙）不論國內外，保障農業利益，（丁）英須利用關稅制，以維持優先權，（戊）設法努力促成國際航空事業之協定。　關於德國問題，應付德民族以今後不使再有重新作戰之能力，但其人民欲生活必須予以工作。　印度政策，將印事務部事務移歸自治領部，使印每年擴大權限。　國內政策，（甲）刷新產業機構，增進能力，加强生產，擴大國家管理，（乙）煤炭電力運輸鋼鐵改歸公有，其他產業及投資均由國家管理。由此觀之，英勞工黨對保守黨之一般態度，認爲在戰時措置失當，有所責難。</p>
<p>中央社訊　英國最近將舉行大選，刻勞工黨頗具操縱權力，於二十五日舉行之大會，在極勉强之形勢下閉會，故今後對英國此次之改選，殊值得注意。</p>
<h3>開發洞庭西山之管見</h3>
<p>— 潘爵銘</p>
<p>本月十二日，上海工商各界領袖組織蘇省訪問團赴蘇考察，筆者奉市教育局戴局長之命，追隨　彥之後，謬厠觀光之列，關於此次赴蘇目的及其收獲，各報巳有記載，如十七日申報之「滬市各界代表訪問隊省記」，與十八日新聞報之「西山之旅」，記載均極翔實。筆者對於西山之地理環境社會狀况，不欲贅述，茲傲就疏散人口改良生產及建設學校諸問題，略貢芻莞，以供關心開發西山者之參考而已。</p>
<p>疏散人口</p>
<p>竊以爲疏散人口之先决條件，首在交通之便利，治安之確保，否則人將視爲畏途，裹足不前，疏散工作必至無圓滿結果。是以欲談疏散，必先解除交通困難，確保西山治安，至居住問題，則其次要者也。</p>
<p>交通　關於交通問題，可分爲二：其一爲穌滬問之交通問題，其二爲蘇州與西山間之交通問題。</p>
<p>蘇滬交通方面，現雖有陸路之鐵道與公路，及蘇州河之水路交通。但因種種困難，運輸未能暢達，不足以摘應疏散之需要。現蘇滬建設當局業已招標興築務滬新公路，月內可以開工，預定七月下旬全段工程可以竣事。此項公路係與鐵道平行，全程八十公里，汽車約行兩小時，倘此路完成，對務滬交通便利不少。然運輸車輛之購置，路政之管理，均有待於隊滬建設當局早爲之計，妥爲籌劃，俾該路成爲滬蘇交通之輸血管，人口疏散之大動脈。至於鐵路，甚盼華鐵當局能切實改善路政，便利行旅，倘蘇滬交通暢達，則人口疏散問題，亦可迎刃而解矣。</p>
<p>蘇州與西山間交通，雖有輪渡可通。然船隻小，班次少，若人口疏散一且實行，實不足以適應運輸之需要。且太湖湖面遼闊，而深度頗淺，加以港口淤塞，載量稍重之船隻，即有擱淺之虞，故欲大量疏散人口，必先濬治港口，建築硒頭，製造船隻（平底闊面之船），方可便於行駛。關於此項工程，次非一蹴即成，實有賴於政府當局，實樂領袖，官商協力經營，方克在成。</p>
<p>治安　西山屹立於太湖中，與洞庭東山素爲盜匪出沒之區，現表面雖稱安謐，但警力薄弱，民間自衛力最猶未建立，加以四面環水，設一旦有事，孤立無援，必至束手無策，倘疏散人口付諸實行，則西山治安，首當確保。其辦法有三：</p>
<p>一，馴派駐兵力西山面積九十里，有二鎭八鄉，倘能由政府派軍警數百人，配備充實，以任西山之警備，則治安可告無患。</p>
<p>二，訓練民警　西山現有二十歲至三十歲之壯丁共一萬一千四百人，而農民佔全區居民百分之六十五，倘能於農作之暇，施行嚴格訓練　並就其中愼選五百人擔任民警，協助　望，一旦有事，與軍警共向禦敵，寓　於農，輕而易舉。</p>
<p>三，强化保甲西山雖有保甲組織，惟極幼稚，倘能加以餒格訓練，切實指導，實施迎坐法，守望相助，則　民無從寄居其問，對於治安，必有裨　。</p>
<p>居住　關於人口疏散，除交通及治安兩主要問題外，其次當推居住問題。西山建築均極堅固，高聽大廈，亦復不少，所有該地空屋及公產，樂由金區長令飭各鄉鎭長，在本月底前負責調查車報，倘疏散人口一旦實行，則西山房屋之不敷應用，自不待言。惟工商界領袖果願投資開發西山，籌款協助疏散，則就地建築簡單住屋，實非難事。因當地勞力代價低廉，建築材料豐富，（就地產青灰石及麻石，有石灰窰磚瓦窰甚多）工料兩項不成問題，則建造房屋當屬可辦。（以下轉入第二版）</p>
<h3>敘利亞黎巴嫩　局勢愈緊張　法軍施威脅性措置</h3>
<p>里斯本二十八日中央社電　據開羅電：阿拉伯聯盟秘書長貝伊茲特宣稱，阿拉伯聯賬大會，將於六月四日召開，向時渠復稱，渠已獲訊叙利亞黎巴嫩兩國之局勢愈趨惡化云。自阿勒波區發生衝突後，森奈格爾非軍及其他法軍，已在里文達施行各項威脅性之措置，彼等已將各大城市間主要交通綫截斷，同時將各城市之進出口守住，低空飛行之飛機不斷向該處居民實行神經性之演習，戰車成羣於街上馳騁，總之，里文達地區已呈山雨欲來風滿樓之緊張情勢。</p>
<p>里斯本十八日中央社電　據此間接獲消息：法軍一度自阿勒波中部地區撤退，至昨日法軍野戰砲隊及機關砲隊再度開抵城中，該時敍國軍隊增强該地之防軍，於週六夜時有斷續之槍砲射擊聲，至翌日發現阿勒波區內有民房一座，遭法軍砲火所燬，然關於此項消息，目前尚未經官方證實。</p>
<h3>德空軍司令　格拉姆自殺</h3>
<p>瑞典京城二十八日中央社電　據倫敦訊：網戈林之後，任德空軍最高司令之格拉姆，業已自殺</p>
<p>里斯本二十八日中央社電　據英第三軍最高司令部發表，希特勒元首之胞姊二人，於昨日被捕。又據倫敦公報稱，希姆萊之弟，已於昨日遭英第二軍逮捕。按渠曾爲德親衛隊隊員。目前英軍當局正嚴密看守，以防其自殺</p>
<h3>荷蘭要求　合併德領土</h3>
<p>瑞典京城二十八日中央社電　據絡透社訊：二十五日荷蘭電台廣播如次：荷蘭欲合併德國領二萬五千方公里，蓋爲維持一百五十萬荷蘭人民之生活，此次合併德領土，並非荷蘭有帝國主義式之企圖，實乃荷蘭必需採取之措置也，合併他區內之德人當然一律放逐云。</p>
<h3>德國境內　發生游繫戰</h3>
<p>瑞典京城二十八日中央社電　據蘇聯「紅星」報消息：德國「亡命遊擊隊」現仍隱置於昔日蘇德戰綫之各部森林中，向蘇軍繼續抗戰，該項遊擊隊時以突圍之舉動而獲取糧食，同時發現彼等有穿着紅軍制服，或施以其他各種喬裝手法，混入城外四郊，於前日夜突發生一繼續三十分鐘之接觸，結果彼等有三十七名被殺，廿八名被俘。</p>
<h3>日本的大學生與特攻隊</h3>
<p>對談　艦隊報道部：松本大尉　本報：記者</p>
<p>松本：東京帝大教授和辻哲郎博士有過叫做「風土」的名著。我們的生命都是誕生於日本，生長於日本。日本的風土是我們生命的母胎，精神的故鄉。日本國土四周有澎湃的海濤冲激着，日本國內密佈着山淸水秀的景色，並且季節的有着强烈的颱風吹來，日本的風土的特殊性也是造成日本青年的强烈的性格的原因。</p>
<p>記者：風土學與民族學的確有密切的關係。時常遭受周期性的暴風或地震的民族，其生命力量一定是强盛的，反抗意志一定是很堅決的。日本的國民一方面團然因爲山明水秀，所以有很織細的感情，表現於俳句，短歌，而他方面因爲季節的氣候變化或是地質的關係，又有着非常强烈的感情，往往表現於慷慨激昂，可歌可泣的實踐行動，特攻隊員一方面從容赴死，一方面還有許多就義時的詩歌遺留下來，大概可以說是日本風土性表現於民族性格一面吧。</p>
<p>松本：日本與中國在風土學上講是同屬於「藝孫」型風土的，署熱與濕潤目然交鉛，所以民族的性格又富於持久耐勞的精神。日本雖然因爲颱風等的關係，有着强烈的突發的性格，然而又因爲爲於「蒙孫」型的風土，所以能够有堅靸的不屈不撓的力量。</p>
<p>西洋文明的沒落</p>
<p>松本：史賓格勒（Orwald　Spengler）有一本叫做「西洋的沒落」的著作，很是有名。西洋的物質文明以及資本主義文化雖然在第一次歐戰時沒有減亡，可是在這一次大戰之後，必定崩潰。我們可以證實：光明是從東方來的。世界新文化的中心將移到中國與日本來。中國與日本應該樹立獨自的思想體系，然後由於中日兩國新的結合，建設亞細亞的新文明。</p>
<p>記者：西洋的文明大都偏於唯物的，所以造威了他們依賴物質力量的習慣。我們固然不能只重唯心方面，應該唯物和唯心結成運然一體，然後物質和精神的力量都能够充分發揮。現在日本的特攻隊，就是人和飛機的結合，特攻情神就是「心物一體」的表現。這是西洋的青年所做不到的，同時也就是日本靑年的特性。東方文化的眞精神表現於實踐行動的最高樂。</p>
<p>亞細亞的共同運命</p>
<p>松本：民族與民族的結合有種種要素，有血緣，有言語，有宗教等等，然而澴有一個重要的要素，那便是共同的運命。兩民族在同一敵人的壓力下，自然會發生共問的意識。現在中國與日本的確自然而然會感到運命共同的感覺。所以中日兩國的青年更應該相互理解起來，提携起來。日本的靑年現在正以特攻精神爲保衛東亞而努力，我希望中國的靑年對於我們的特攻精神，能够理解，幷且爲自己的祖國，爲東亞而奮發起來。</p>
<p>記者：孫文先生說過：「無日本則無中國，無中國則無日本」。這句名訓，就指示出中國和日本的運命，中日兩國只能在肯定與肯定的塲合，能共謀亞細亞的發展，在否定與否定的塲合，無法找到未來共同的前途。我相信，中臼靑年之間現在對於這名訓的深刻的意義可以漸漸認識起來。日本靑年旣有特攻精神的表現，中國靑年也不能不表現所謂「天地正大之氣」，爲中國，爲東亞而努力。我們想到文天祥的正氣歌與日本藤田東湖的正氣歌時，覺得我們中間的精神的距離因爲先哲的教訓顯得非常接近。</p>
<p>日本特攻隊的戰績</p>
<p>記者：四年前日本海戰時，東鄉元帥的戰法也可以說是一種突擊的特攻精神的表現。帝俄的波羅的海艦隊在東鄉元帥指揮的砲擊下殲減了。今日特攻隊的戰法雖和四十年前的戰法不同，可是在精神上的確是一實的。</p>
<p>松本：我們擊減敵人，就是用我們超越生死的慷慨的氣魄與堅決的信念。這是東鄉元帥的精神，也是日本固有的武士道的精神。日木青年的體內充滿着父祖遺下的忠魂，在敵人來襲時，決意使敵人多多出血。冲繩島的決戰擊沉了敵人五百多艘艦船，就是在陸上戰門的第十軍也幾乎全滅。並且二十四日夜，我們的特別攻擊隊義烈空挺部隊在敵人代替航空母艦的北中兩飛機塲降下，使敵人後方遭到極大的混亂。現在敵人以物量與我們的精神力求得均衡，然而物量無論如何是有限的，而我們的精神是無限的，再奮發一下，便可以一口氣把他們的物質力量擊破。</p>
<p>記者：我們欣逢日本第四十屆海軍節，想起四十年前日本海戰光榮的勝利，更期待日本靑年的特攻精神充分發揮，獲得大東亞戰爭的最後勝利。</p>
<p>松平：日本絕對的能够獲得勝利。日本國家有着二千六百年的傳統精神，日本靑年有着充沛的生命力量。敵美的長處是科學的分析，我們的特攻隊的精神是超越了科學分析的。這是我們致勝的原動力，也是今日日木海軍魂的具體的顯現。（完）</p>

<h3>開發洞庭西山管見（自第一版轉來）　改良生產</h3>
<p>此次疏散人口之意義，決非消極之避難行為，而係轉移上海過剩之人力，用作積極之開發建築，在此種意義上之疏散人口，疏散者必須人人負擔開發西山增加生產之責任，由於西山食糧尙不能自足自給，故改良生產，尤為當前之爭務。</p>
<p>開墾荒地　西山面積九十里，而耕地祗八千九百八十五畝，但空地山地蕩地三者共有六萬五千五百十八畝，設能採用科學方法，加以墾殖，或植稻麥，成種馬鈴著等補助食糧，則預計產量必可十倍於今日。</p>
<p>改良生產技術　我國農村生活技術之落後，各地皆然，設生產技術不能改良，則增加生產亦緣木求魚而巳。西山雖近少會，但仍富我國古代農村社會之色彩，無論耕種，專恃人施，設能改用簡單之機械及畜力，並力以肥料，則生產率必可增加。至於菓樹若能改良菓種，防止害虫，產量亦可大增。他若蠶桑茶葉，如能用科學方法栽培養育，其產量必可觀。至於煤礦，現皆採用方法加以開掘，則可以少數之勞力，獲得大量之生產。如此雖西山之食糧不足，然可以水菓蠶桑茶葉煤柴之輸出，而換取所需之食　。</p>
<h3>籌設學校</h3>
<p>西山環境優美，山明水秀，與繁華都市相隔絕，誠理想之敎育環境虵。西山現有區立完全小學兩所，鄕鎭初級小學八所，私塾兩所，共學生一千五百餘人，對於當地學齡兒童，尙可容納。然人口疏散一旦被告，則籌辦學校，自屬必要，其一即為隨家長疏散而去之學齡兒童的敎育問題，其二即疏散上海一部份中學乃至專科以上學校，而成立聯合中學或大學。惟為適應當地之情形，切合事實之需要，除設普通學校外，竊以為設立職業學校我及短期職業補習學校，實有必要，請分而言之：</p>
<p>設立普通學校　敎育問題乃伴隨疏散問題而須同時解決之重要課題，蓋國家不可一日無敎育，因此政府對於此等被疏散者子女之敎育，自應為之解決。其一為則由政府於當地開辦中小學，以容納學齡兒童，其二為未綢繆，為準備萬一計，先由政府發動疏散一部份市立中學學生與圖書儀器，前往開課，（因小學生須隨家長行動為轉移，故先以疏散中學始）同時由政府勸導，並協助私立學校，實行疏散，必要時得强迫以行之。</p>
<p>職業學校　値此頻年戰爭，物資匱乏，高唱增加生產之秋，提倡職業敎育，政府業有明令。為開發西山富源，訓練生產人材計，於西山創辦職業學校，尤屬必要。職業學校可分為二：其一為造就基本之生產人才，可設立初級高級職業學校，設團藝，畜牧，（包括家禽）竄案等科，以訓練開發西山改良生產人才起見，可設職業補習學校，招收成男女，授以各種生美學家識，俾能担負增加生產之工作，其成果易見，而收效必宏，可斷言也。</p>

<h3>Eleven Ships Sunk or Damaged Near Nakagusuku Bay, Okinawa: Result of Japanese Air Force's Nighttime General Offensive</h3>
<p>Frontline Base, 28th (Central News Agency Telegram) - In coordination with the duties of the Giretsu Airborne Unit, the Japanese Air Force, from late night on the 27th to dawn on the 28th, used the "Thunder Squad", Special Attack Teams, and heavy bombers to launch a general offensive against enemy fleets attempting new operations in the vicinity of Nakagusuku Bay, Okinawa. As a result, they sank three enemy large transport ships, two cruisers, one battleship, heavily damaged one large transport ship, one medium transport ship, and three ships of unknown type. Furthermore, Army Assault Teams and Navy heavy bomber squadrons, overcoming enemy nighttime fighter interceptions, attacked Ie Shima and seized control of the island's airfield. In this operation, only one Japanese aircraft failed to return.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 28th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a report from the U.S. military base on Iwo Jima, a powerful Japanese "Air Fleet" launched a fierce attack on the U.S. Pacific Fleet around Okinawa Island for approximately eighteen hours between the 24th and 25th, reportedly damaging eleven ships.</p>
<p>Naha Area Hills Discolored: U.S. Announces Naval Losses</p>
<p>Lisbon, 28th (Central News Agency Telegram) - A New York Herald Tribune reporter, on the 24th, published the following account of the fierce fighting from the frontline base near Okinawa to the area near Naha: Due to weeks of shelling, the hilly terrain has become discolored. U.S. military vehicles are buried in mud pits, and the vast fields connecting the northwest slope are scattered with helmets, water bottles, and other equipment abandoned during the hasty retreat of the U.S. Marines. Furthermore, on the muddy roads west of the hills, the remains of U.S. tanks and amphibious vehicles are everywhere, all destroyed by Japanese artillery fire.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 28th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a report from Guam, Nimitz Headquarters announced that since the beginning of the Okinawa operation, naval casualties have reached 35,116. Furthermore, according to a dispatch from Washington, the U.S. Navy Department announced that in the Okinawa area, the U.S. destroyer *Liddle* and four other vessels were sunk by the Japanese. The *Liddle*, a 2,000-ton elite vessel, had only been commissioned in May of last year.</p>
<h3>Situation in Various Battle Zones</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The war situation this week is as follows: The Battle of Okinawa in the Ryukyus has intensified further this week, with fierce land, sea, and air battles continuing. Since the 19th, after the enemy reinforced their forces, they launched another major offensive. Consequently, fierce battles have unfolded along the entire line from the east coast to the west coast. Especially on the east coast, the enemy made some progress on the 25th, but after Japanese forces counterattacked, especially in the fierce assault northwest of Yonabaru, enemy casualties were even greater. In other areas, such as the central Shuri area, the west coast, and the area in front of Naha, although the enemy launched repeated fierce attacks, the Japanese eastern unit's counterattacks were effective. The enemy's attempts to seize key Japanese positions resulted in only slight advances near Makabi. Some enemy troops infiltrating the area east of Naha City were also repelled to the vicinity of Anri. The enemy, with five divisions – the 96th, 7th, 77th, 1st Marine Division, and 6th Marine Division – using tanks as their vanguard, launched continuous attacks, only to see their losses increase, and the pace of their advance slower than the previous week. As of the 18th, enemy casualties were approximately 52,700, with 565 tanks abandoned or destroyed. Adding in subsequent damages, the land battle alone has already exceeded 60,000. Japanese Special Attack Units and Air Force, responding to the brave fighting of the land units, fiercely attacked enemy ship formations, as well as the northern and central airfields on the main island and the Ie Shima airfield. On the night of the 24th, the Giretsu Airborne Unit forcibly landed at the northern and central airfields on Okinawa Island, seizing enemy aircraft and various airfield facilities on the ground, throwing the enemy's formation into complete chaos, with explosions occurring at over 150 locations. B-29 aircraft from southern bases, to counter Japanese aircraft attacks on Okinawa, have been carrying out tactical bombing of Japanese bases since mid-April. Recently, they have also been carrying out strategic bombing of major cities. After large-scale nighttime bombing of Nagoya on the 14th and 17th, on the nights of the 23rd and 25th, approximately 250 B-29s each time attacked Tokyo, using incendiary bombs. The results of the interceptions on the 23rd and 25th nights totaled 74 aircraft shot down. On the Burma front, because Japanese forces are preparing a strategic posture, and the enemy is also diligently preparing their front, before the rainy season, a situation of stalemate is gradually emerging. Apart from the fierce battles in the plateau area of the Hukawng Valley and nearby battlefields, the situation has not changed much, and the enemy is continuously reinforcing their forces from the rear, their intentions cannot be underestimated.</p>
<h3>Military Commentator Discusses Recent Okinawa Situation: Japan Determined to Fight to the End for Victory</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency Report) - A Shanghai military commentator, observing the recent situation on Okinawa Island, notes that the enemy's progress is hindered, and their losses are severe. On the southern Okinawa front, fierce fighting continues along the line from Naha through Shuri to Yonabaru. Since the 24th, the Japanese and U.S. forces have been fiercely fighting along the Asato River. After the enemy secured a bridgehead in the southern part of the area, they repeatedly attempted to advance, but each time they were defeated by the Japanese forces, and they have not yet abandoned their attempts, constantly harassing the area. Recently, the enemy laid bridges again across the Asato River, but the Japanese forces launched fierce attacks against the enemy from the night of the 25th, inflicting heavy damage. Enemy corpses are floating in the river. Although the enemy eventually laid two more bridges across the Asato River, attempting to invade Naha, after the 24th, heavy rains and flooding washed away three of the four bridges that the enemy had laid across the Asato River. In the central Okinawa area, the enemy's 1st Marine Division and the Army's 77th and 96th Divisions are encircling Shuri. The 1st Marine Division and the 96th Division have made some progress, seemingly attempting to invade Shuri. On the eastern front are the enemy's 7th Division and a portion of the 96th Division. The 7th Division's advance is slow, while the 96th Division is planning to encircle Yonabaru. In this operation, the enemy has only advanced two or three nautical miles on average in one month, as clearly indicated by enemy military leaders and in reports.</p>
<p>U.S. Admits to Operational Difficulties</p>
<p>According to a broadcast from San Francisco on the 28th, United Press correspondent Warrens, reporting from the Okinawa front, stated that U.S. forces in Okinawa have encountered significant difficulties in operations over the past month, advancing only three miles on the front lines. He also stated, "I had left for only four weeks. When I returned, I saw the roads and airfields reinforced, as well as the U.S. forces. While some optimists had claimed that U.S. forces would soon capture Shuri and advance into Naha, Naha remains uncaptured, and Shuri is still on the periphery. The results of this fierce frontline battle are evident. The Shuri radio station is still under Japanese control. Seven weeks ago, U.S. forces could see the radio station quite clearly, and realistic U.S. soldiers have told reporters that this operation will need until the end of June to be completed. The U.S. generals and soldiers on the front lines deeply recognize the slow progress and the severity of the fighting. At the same time, general army commanders believe that a frontal assault on the Japanese defense forces is tantamount to suicide, at least at the cost of most of the U.S. forces. Therefore, they estimate that the U.S. forces will advance only two and a half nautical miles in one month, and future actions will be quite difficult."</p>
<p>Japanese Forces Inflict Severe Damage on the Enemy</p>
<p>The military commentator stated that, according to the Japanese reporting unit for maritime operations, large Japanese special attack formations have launched three-dimensional attacks on the enemy, and the Giretsu Special Attack Unit has inflicted severe damage on the enemy and destroyed various enemy facilities. According to enemy reports, emergency alerts have been issued for up to eight hours. Based on the above situation, we can infer that the enemy will face numerous difficulties in the future battle of Okinawa Island, especially the long and unsustainable supply lines. We deeply believe that the enemy's possible tactics against the Japanese forces in the future will be strategic bombing. General Doolittle, former commander of the Eighth Air Force, has been reappointed to that position. Doolittle was responsible for the first air raid on Japan in 1942. This man is a specialist in medium-sized bombers, but based on his renowned observations, it will be difficult for him to achieve great things. According to a recent statement by U.S. Foreign Economic Administration Director Crowley, "The Japanese military strength is strong, and its strength is abundant in a long-term war. There are abundant resources in Japan, Taiwan, Korea, Manchuria, and North China." He also stated that it is currently difficult to "liberate" even 7% of the 3 million square miles of Dutch East Indies, British Malaya, and the Philippines occupied by Japan in 1941. At the same time, Japanese factories have been dispersed for wartime purposes, and the country has always had a large amount of material, and fully developed production." We can see the strength of Japan's combat power. In the future, we should expand our operations to cause the enemy absolute difficulties. Recently, rumors have spread from San Francisco and London that Japan is negotiating peace with Britain and the United States through Soviet mediation. This is absolutely not true. In fact, Britain and the United States have already realized the difficulties of the war and are spreading rumors to cause trouble. The top Japanese leaders have repeatedly stated their determination to fight to the end and achieve a final glorious victory.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Sino-Japanese Cooperation at the Current Stage</h3>
<p>Sino-Japanese cooperation, whether during the war or after, whether for the two governments or the people, has long been an established principle, as natural and just as the laws of heaven. Today, it should no longer need to be mentioned, but is a time for practical implementation and fruitful results. However, this does not mean that Sino-Japanese cooperation has been implemented in a satisfactory manner. On the contrary, there are inevitably areas where mutual efforts are incomplete or imperfect. We believe that Sino-Japanese cooperation, in principle and in theory, no longer needs to be discussed. However, in practice, in order to achieve perfection and thoroughness, we should still frankly point out areas for mutual research and improvement. An attitude of "concealing one's illness and refusing treatment" is absolutely unacceptable.</p>
<p>We believe that the Japanese side also feels the same way. In the current stage of the Greater East Asia War, which is becoming increasingly severe, the Japanese government and people have recently expressed great importance to the issue of Sino-Japanese cooperation. For example, the Continental Liaison Conference was held in Tokyo on the 19th and 20th of this month. Foreign Minister and Minister for Greater East Asia Affairs Tōgō, in order to discuss the operation of policies towards China with envoys stationed in China, also held a conference of office directors of embassies in China on the 21st of this month. In his instructions, Tōgō specifically pointed out that "As the situation progresses, the importance of Japan's problems with China is expanding. In addition to assisting China's unification and the completion of its autonomy and independence, Japan seeks equality in the political field and mutual benefit in the economic field, and establishes friendly relations between China and Japan. Japan must overcome all obstacles and realize its fundamental policy, which is closely related to Japan's overcoming of current difficulties." What a clear and frank exposition! On the 28th of this month, the Japan-China Association was established under the leadership of Duke Konoe Fumimaro to strengthen cooperation, promote friendship, and enhance Sino-Japanese cooperation. It is very clear that the motive is to echo what was indicated by Foreign Minister and Minister for Greater East Asia Affairs Tōgō.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the Chinese people, as mentioned above, we should no longer talk about principles and theories. We hope that everyone will be frank and pragmatic, and put the principles and theories of Sino-Japanese cooperation into practice. Today, no one can say that there is still room for hesitation regarding these principles and theories. At the same time, we cannot deny that some people are insincere about these principles and theories, paying lip service and feigning compliance, which has led to unexpected difficulties in the practice of Sino-Japanese cooperation. However, the characteristic of our Eastern nations is not to fear difficulties. The more difficult it is, the more we must strive. We should all have this strong belief in today's Sino-Japanese cooperation issue.</p>
<p>The Chinese people, when discussing Sino-Japanese cooperation at the current stage, believe that the most important thing is to focus on solving the actual problems currently facing the two countries. For China, the most practical and serious problem today is the suffering of the people. Therefore, we believe that to promote Sino-Japanese cooperation, the first requirement today is to solve the problem of the suffering of the Chinese people. Only when this problem is solved can we talk about other higher principles and theories. In fact, only by pragmatically solving the suffering of the Chinese people can the true value of Sino-Japanese cooperation be demonstrated. The extremely serious food problem is the best test. Of course, this is a complex and difficult problem, but everyone understands that as long as the responsible authorities on both sides of China and Japan show sincerity and strength, and with mutual restraint and patience, it is possible to solve this serious problem! If this path is opened up, then the entire Sino-Japanese cooperation issue, no matter how gloomy it may seem today, will have hope and certainty of becoming clear!</p>
<p>We have always believed that the practice and completion of Sino-Japanese cooperation should be based on adapting to the national conditions and popular sentiments of both sides and grasping the minds of the people of the two countries. For the Chinese people, the most pressing issue at the current stage is to alleviate the suffering of the Chinese people in a way that is suitable for China's national conditions and popular sentiments. We hope that everyone will show sincerity in Sino-Japanese cooperation through self-restraint, patience, and increased effort.</p>

<h3>Mother of Chen, Madam Wei Passes Away in Nanjing</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Madam Wei, mother of the late Chairman Wang's mother-in-law, Chen Jizu, Chen 　Jun, Chen Shunzhen, and Chen Changzu, passed away in Nanjing at 10:50 PM on the 27th. The encoffining ceremony was held at her residence at No. 39 Yihe Road at 3:00 PM on the 28th.

<h3>Minister of Justice Wu Reports on Work Overview: Reforming Accumulated Abuses and Paying Attention to Prison Hygiene</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Ministry of Justice held a regular meeting with domestic and foreign journalists at 3:00 PM this afternoon, presided over by Minister Wu Songgao himself. He gave the following brief report on the work of the Ministry: When I took office, I immediately ordered the heads of all subordinate courts and offices to strictly investigate their subordinates, and to report any who were derelict in their duties or whose conduct was flawed, so that they could be dealt with accordingly. In addition, I also ordered the responsible divisions and sections to carefully review the civil and criminal cases reported by the various courts and offices. Any personnel found to be negligent in handling cases would be severely punished upon verification. Recently, several cases of negligence in handling cases by judges at all levels have been discovered. The responsible personnel have been given punishments ranging from demerits to dismissal. The National Government promulgated the Amnesty Law this year. After receiving the order, the Ministry immediately transmitted it to all subordinate courts and offices, instructing them to quickly release those prisoners who should be pardoned according to law. Cases that should be commuted must also be completed within two months of receipt of the documents. Many courts and offices that have completed the handling have presented their handling situation and rulings to the Ministry for review. Prison operations and hygiene are extremely important. We have repeatedly issued orders to improve them. The Prison Department Director was sent to inspect prisons in Nanjing, Changzhou, Suzhou, and Wuxi last month, and to provide on-site guidance on operations, hygiene, and management. According to the inspection results, the Zhenjiang Prison is the most commendable. In order to improve hygiene in Shanghai prisons and raise medical funds, I personally went to Shanghai. I held a tea party at the Kang Le Restaurant in Shanghai at 3:00 PM on the 18th of this month, inviting enthusiastic donations. The donations will be collected by the end of this month. It is planned to establish a custodial committee locally to be responsible for custody, in order to ensure proper distribution and achieve the practical effect of improving prison hygiene. The provisions on interest rates in the Civil Code's Book on Obligations and the Negotiable Instruments Law are quite unsuitable for the current social and economic situation. Various banking and money lending associations have repeatedly submitted requests for relief. The Ministry has formulated temporary measures on wartime interest rates, which have been presented for approval and implementation.</p>
<p>It is also reported that due to the recent rise in prices, the monthly expenses for prisoner food are insufficient. The Ministry of Justice's Minister Wu went to the Ministry of Finance on the 28th to negotiate an increase in the budget in order to maintain the current situation and ensure that criminals receive reasonable treatment. The matter is currently under negotiation.</p>
<h3>Wuhan Military and Political Agencies Hold Business Meeting</h3>

<h3>Chongqing Holds Sixth Central Executive Committee Meeting</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 28th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to Chongqing Broadcasting: Following the Sixth National Congress, the Chongqing side held the first plenary session of the Sixth Central Executive Committee on the 28th. This meeting was to discuss issues such as the election of National Assembly representatives and the draft constitution, which had not been resolved by the National Political Council.</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 28th (Central News Agency telegram) - The Sixth National Congress of Chongqing decided to change the Three Principles of the People Youth League from a Kuomintang organ to a direct affiliate of the Executive Yuan. According to a broadcast from Chongqing on the 36th, a temporary plenary session of the Central Executive Committee was held, where the issue of changing affiliation to the Executive Yuan caused controversy.</p>
<h3>British Labour Party Announces Platform: General Election Competition Worth Watching</h3>
<p>Central News Agency - According to sources in Shanghai, the British Labour Party's proposed platform is as follows: Regarding foreign policy, (A) provide full assistance to the Pacific War; (B) maintain the closest cooperation among the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, France, and Chongqing, based on a world organization with the meaning and power to prevent aggression, as a group security guarantee, and absolutely exclude inciting small countries to suppress large countries. Regarding international trade, (A) cooperate with the international economy; (B) eliminate international corporate activities that restrict producers or cause material scarcity for personal gain; (C) protect agricultural interests both domestically and internationally; (D) Britain must use tariffs to maintain priority; (E) strive to promote agreements on international aviation. Regarding the German question, the German nation should be dealt with in a way that prevents it from having the ability to re-engage in war, but its people must be given work to live. As for Indian policy, the affairs of the India Office will be transferred to the Department of Self-Governing Territories, allowing India to expand its powers annually. Regarding domestic policy, (A) revitalize industrial institutions, increase capacity, strengthen production, and expand state management; (B) coal, electricity, transportation, and steel will be nationalized, and other industries and investments will be managed by the state. From this, it can be seen that the British Labour Party's general attitude towards the Conservative Party is that it mishandled wartime measures and is subject to criticism.</p>
<p>Central News Agency - Britain will hold a general election soon. The Labour Party has considerable power. The conference held on the 25th closed under extremely strained circumstances. Therefore, the upcoming British election is particularly noteworthy.</p>
<h3>A Humble Opinion on the Development of West Dongting Mountain</h3>
<p>— Pan Jueming</p>
<p>On the 12th of this month, leading figures from Shanghai's industrial and commercial sectors organized a Jiangsu Province Visiting Delegation to inspect Jiangsu. I was ordered by Director Dai of the Municipal Education Bureau to follow them and humbly participate in the tour. The purpose and gains of this trip have been recorded in various newspapers, such as the "Record of the Shanghai Representatives Visiting Team in Jiangsu Province" in the 17th issue of Shen Bao and the "Journey to West Mountain" in the 18th issue of Xinwen Bao, both of which are extremely detailed. I do not wish to elaborate on the geographical environment and social conditions of West Mountain. I would like to offer some humble suggestions on issues such as dispersing the population, improving production, and building schools, for the reference of those concerned about the development of West Mountain.</p>
<p>Dispersing the Population</p>
<p>I believe that the prerequisite for dispersing the population is convenient transportation and guaranteed public security. Otherwise, people will regard it as a daunting task and hesitate to move forward, and the dispersal work will inevitably fail to achieve satisfactory results. Therefore, to talk about dispersal, one must first solve the transportation difficulties and ensure the security of West Mountain. The housing problem is secondary.</p>
<p>Transportation Regarding transportation, it can be divided into two aspects: one is the transportation between Shanghai and Suzhou, and the other is the transportation between Suzhou and West Mountain.</p>
<p>Regarding transportation between Shanghai and Suzhou, although there are railways and highways for land transportation and waterways along the Suzhou River, due to various difficulties, transportation is not smooth and cannot meet the needs of dispersal. Currently, the construction authorities of Shanghai and Suzhou have already invited bids to build a new highway between Shanghai and Suzhou, which can start construction this month and is expected to be completed in late July. This highway runs parallel to the railway, with a total length of eighty kilometers, and cars can travel for about two hours. If this road is completed, it will greatly facilitate transportation between Shanghai and Suzhou. However, the purchase of transportation vehicles and the management of road administration require the construction authorities of Shanghai and Suzhou to plan ahead and make proper arrangements so that the road becomes the blood vessel of transportation between Shanghai and Suzhou and the major artery for dispersing the population. As for the railway, it is hoped that the China Railway Authority can effectively improve road administration and facilitate travel. If transportation between Shanghai and Suzhou is smooth, the problem of dispersing the population can also be easily solved.</p>
<p>Although there is a ferry between Suzhou and West Mountain, the ships are small and the number of trips is limited, which is insufficient to meet the needs of transportation if the population dispersal is implemented. Moreover, the Taihu Lake surface is vast and the depth is quite shallow. In addition, the ports are silted up, and ships with slightly heavier loads are prone to grounding. Therefore, to disperse the population in large quantities, it is necessary to dredge the ports, build docks, and manufacture ships (flat-bottomed and wide-faced ships) to facilitate navigation. This project cannot be completed overnight and relies on the joint efforts of government authorities, local leaders, officials, and merchants to succeed.</p>
<p>Public Security West Mountain stands in the middle of Taihu Lake and, together with East Dongting Mountain, has always been an area where bandits roam. Although it appears peaceful on the surface, the police force is weak, and the self-defense capabilities of the people have not yet been established. In addition, it is surrounded by water, and if something happens, it will be isolated and helpless, inevitably leading to a helpless situation. If the dispersal of the population is implemented, the security of West Mountain should be ensured first. There are three ways to do this:</p>
<p>First, dispatch troops to West Mountain. West Mountain covers an area of ninety li and has two towns and eight townships. If the government can send hundreds of soldiers and police officers, equipped adequately, to be responsible for the security of West Mountain, then public security can be guaranteed.</p>
<p>Second, train civilian police. West Mountain currently has a total of 11,400 able-bodied men between the ages of 20 and 30, and farmers account for 65% of the total population. If strict training can be carried out in the spare time of farming, and 500 people can be carefully selected from among them to serve as civilian police to assist, then in the event of an emergency, they can defend against the enemy together with the military police. Combining farming and defense is easy.</p>
<p>Third, strengthen the Baojia system. Although West Mountain has a Baojia organization, it is still very immature. If it can be given strict training, practical guidance, and implement the "greeting and sitting" method to help each other, then [criminals] will have nowhere to live, which will definitely benefit public security.</p>
<p>Housing Regarding the dispersal of the population, in addition to the two major issues of transportation and public security, the next important issue is housing. The buildings in West Mountain are very solid, and there are many high-rise buildings. All the vacant houses and public properties in the area should be ordered by Director Jin of the district to be investigated and reported by the township heads by the end of this month. If the dispersal of the population is implemented, it goes without saying that the housing in West Mountain will not be enough. However, if leading figures in the industrial and commercial sectors are willing to invest in the development of West Mountain and raise funds to assist in the dispersal, it will not be difficult to build simple housing on the spot. Because local labor costs are low and building materials are abundant (local green-gray stone and granite, with many lime kilns and brick and tile kilns), the costs of labor and materials are not a problem, and building houses should be feasible.

<h3>Situation in Syria and Lebanon Becomes More Tense: French Army Takes Threatening Measures</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 28th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to a Cairo dispatch: Arab League Secretary-General Bey Azzat announced that the Arab League General Assembly will be held on June 4th. He also stated that he had received information that the situation in Syria and Lebanon was deteriorating. Since the conflict in the Aleppo region, Senegalese non-military personnel and other French troops have been implementing threatening measures in Riviera. They have cut off the main transportation lines between major cities and guarded the entrances and exits of various cities. Low-flying aircraft are constantly conducting neurological exercises on the residents there. Groups of tanks are galloping through the streets. In short, the Riviera area has reached a tense situation.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to news received here: French troops once withdrew from the central Aleppo area. Until yesterday, French field artillery and anti-aircraft artillery teams returned to the city. At that time, Syrian troops strengthened the defense forces in the area. There were intermittent gunshots and artillery fire on Saturday night. The next day, it was discovered that a civilian house in Aleppo had been destroyed by French artillery fire. However, this information has not yet been officially confirmed.</p>
<h3>German Air Force Commander Gramm Commits Suicide</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 28th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to London: Gramm, who succeeded Goering as the supreme commander of the German Air Force, has committed suicide.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 28th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to a statement issued by the Supreme Headquarters of the British Third Army, two of Hitler's sisters were arrested yesterday. According to the London Gazette, Himmler's brother was arrested by the British Second Army yesterday. He was a member of the German SS. British military authorities are currently keeping a close watch to prevent him from committing suicide.</p>
<h3>Netherlands Demands Annexation of German Territory</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 28th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to a report from the Luo Tuo News Agency: The Dutch radio broadcast the following on the 25th: The Netherlands wants to annex 25,000 square kilometers of German territory in order to maintain the livelihood of 1.5 million Dutch people. This annexation of German territory is not an imperialistic attempt by the Netherlands, but a necessary measure for the Netherlands. The Germans in the annexed area will of course be expelled.</p>
<h3>Guerrilla Warfare Occurs within Germany</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 28th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to the Soviet "Red Star" newspaper: The German "outlaw guerrillas" are still hiding in the forests of the former Soviet-German front, continuing to fight the Soviet army. These guerrillas sometimes obtain food through breakout actions. It has also been discovered that they wear Red Army uniforms or use other disguises to infiltrate the outskirts of the city. The day before yesterday night, a contact lasting thirty minutes suddenly occurred, resulting in 37 of them being killed and 28 being captured.</p>
<h3>University Students and Special Attack Units in Japan</h3>
<p>Dialogue: Lieutenant Commander Matsumoto, Fleet Reporting Department; Reporter, this newspaper</p>
<p>Matsumoto: Professor Tetsuro Watsuji of Tokyo Imperial University had a famous book called "Fudo" (Climate and Culture). Our lives are all born in Japan and grow up in Japan. The climate and culture of Japan are the womb of our lives and the spiritual homeland. The Japanese archipelago is surrounded by the turbulent sea, and the interior of Japan is covered with beautiful mountains and rivers, and the seasons have strong typhoons. The particularity of the climate and culture of Japan is also the reason for the strong character of Japanese youth.</p>
<p>Reporter: Climate and culture are indeed closely related to ethnology. The life force of a nation that is often subjected to periodic storms or earthquakes must be strong, and its will to resist must be firm. On the one hand, the Japanese people have very delicate feelings because of the beautiful mountains and rivers, which are expressed in haiku and short poems. On the other hand, because of seasonal climate changes or geological reasons, they also have very strong feelings, which are often expressed in generous, passionate, and moving practical actions. Special attack unit members are willing to die calmly, and many poems from the time of their sacrifice have been left behind. It can probably be said that the Japanese climate and culture are manifested in the national character.</p>
<p>Matsumoto: Japan and China belong to the same "monsoon" type of climate and culture in terms of climate and culture. The scorching heat and humidity are naturally intertwined, so the national character is also rich in the spirit of perseverance and hard work. Although Japan has a strong sudden character due to typhoons and other factors, it also has a firm and indomitable strength because of the "monsoon" type of climate and culture.</p>
<p>The Decline of Western Civilization</p>
<p>Matsumoto: Oswald Spengler has a book called "The Decline of the West," which is very famous. Although Western material civilization and capitalist culture did not decline during the First World War, they will definitely collapse after this war. We can confirm that light comes from the East. The center of the world's new culture will shift to China and Japan. China and Japan should establish their own ideological systems, and then build a new civilization in Asia through a new union between China and Japan.</p>
<p>Reporter: Western civilization is mostly biased towards materialism, so they have developed a habit of relying on material strength. Of course, we cannot only focus on the spiritual aspect. We should integrate materialism and idealism into a natural whole, and then both material and spiritual strength can be fully utilized. Today's special attack units in Japan are the combination of people and aircraft. The spirit of the special attack is the expression of "mind and matter as one." This is something that Western youth cannot do, and it is also a characteristic of Japanese youth. The true spirit of Eastern culture is expressed in the highest form of practical action.</p>
<p>The Common Destiny of Asia</p>
<p>Matsumoto: There are various elements in the union of nations, such as blood ties, language, religion, etc. However, there is also an important element, which is a common destiny. Two nations will naturally develop a common consciousness under the pressure of the same enemy. Now, China and Japan naturally and spontaneously feel a sense of shared destiny. Therefore, the youth of China and Japan should understand each other and cooperate. Japanese youth are now working hard to defend East Asia with the spirit of special attack. I hope that the Chinese youth can understand our spirit of special attack and strive for their own motherland and for East Asia.</p>
<p>Reporter: Mr. Sun Yat-sen said: "Without Japan, there would be no China; without China, there would be no Japan." This famous motto indicates the destiny of China and Japan. The two countries can only jointly plan the development of Asia in a situation of affirmation and affirmation. In a situation of negation and negation, it is impossible to find a common future. I believe that the youth of China and Japan can gradually recognize the profound meaning of this motto. Since Japanese youth have expressed the spirit of special attack, Chinese youth cannot but express the so-called "righteous spirit of heaven and earth" and work hard for China and for East Asia. When we think of Wen Tianxiang's Song of Righteousness and Fujita Toko's Song of Righteousness, we feel that the spiritual distance between us seems very close because of the lessons of the ancient sages.</p>
<p>The Achievements of the Japanese Special Attack Units</p>
<p>Reporter: Four years ago, during the Japanese naval battle, Admiral Togo's tactics could also be said to be an expression of a special attack spirit of assault. The Baltic Fleet of Imperial Russia was wiped out under the artillery fire commanded by Admiral Togo. Although the tactics of today's special attack units are different from the tactics of forty years ago, they are indeed consistent in spirit.</p>
<p>Matsumoto: We destroy the enemy with our spirit of transcending life and death, and our firm belief. This is the spirit of Admiral Togo, and it is also the spirit of the inherent Bushido of Japan. The bodies of Japanese youth are filled with the loyal souls left by their fathers and ancestors. When the enemy attacks, they are determined to make the enemy bleed more. The decisive battle on Okinawa Island sank more than 500 enemy ships, and the Tenth Army in the land battle was almost completely destroyed. Furthermore, on the night of the 24th, our special attack unit, the Yirei Airborne Unit, landed on the enemy's North and Central airports, which served as replacements for aircraft carriers, causing great confusion in the enemy's rear. Now the enemy is trying to achieve balance with our spiritual power with material quantity. However, material quantity is limited no matter what, and our spirit is unlimited. If we work hard again, we can break through their material power in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>Reporter: We are pleased to meet the 40th Japanese Navy Day. Recalling the glorious victory of the Japanese naval battle forty years ago, we look forward to the full display of the special attack spirit of Japanese youth and the final victory of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>Matsudaira: Japan will absolutely be able to achieve victory. The Japanese nation has a traditional spirit of 2,600 years, and Japanese youth have abundant life force. The advantage of the enemy America is scientific analysis, and the spirit of our special attack units transcends scientific analysis. This is the driving force behind our victory, and it is also the concrete manifestation of the Japanese Navy soul today. (The End)</p>

<h3>Third Issue of Gold Certificates to Be Issued Early Next Month: Listed Price Will Not Be Easily Increased</h3>
<p>After the first issue of gold certificates of the Central Reserve Bank was issued from the 7th to the 9th of this month, all the gold reserves were immediately handed over to the Gold Certificate Issuance Preparation Committee and stored in the vault. It was decided to start payment on June 7th, a total of 1,500 certificates, to be paid out within 100 days. The gold reserves for the second issue of gold certificates have also been handed over to the Issuance Preparation Committee and will soon be checked and stored in the vault by the monthly inspection committee. As for the third issue of gold certificates, it will be processed in early June. Procedures are currently being expedited. It is heard that the listed value will be similar to the second issue. Reporters have learned from market sources that the recent surge in the black market is entirely due to speculative merchants using loose funds to spread unfounded rumors and incite people, in order to manipulate market prices and attempt to reap temporary profits. The Central Reserve Bank's intention in issuing gold certificates is to stabilize finance, contract currency, and curb inflation. It will definitely not easily increase the listed price according to the illegal market conditions. It is expected that the listing price of the third issue of gold certificates will not change significantly.</p>
<h3>Second Issuance Inspection Report</h3>
<p>The Central Reserve Bank issued the second issue of gold certificates for three days from May 21st to 23rd. The gold reserves have been transferred by the bank last week to the designated vault of the Management Committee, where they were received and kept by the committee's storage team. The committee then conducted an inspection of all the reserves in accordance with the detailed rules and announced the results of the inspection as follows:</p>
<p>"Second Inspection Report of the Gold Certificate Issuance Reserve Management Committee: In accordance with Articles 11 and 12 of the Committee's Rules of Procedure, this Committee conducted a second inspection of the Gold Certificate Issuance Reserves on May 24th, 1945, at the vault designated by the Committee in Shanghai. The inspection results are listed on the left:</p>
<p>Total Amount of Gold Certificates Issued by the Central Reserve Bank as of May 23rd, 1945: 30,602 taels.</p>
<p>Total Amount of Gold Reserves in the Committee's Vault: 3,100 bars, totaling 31,002 taels, 2 mace, 7 fen, and 5 li.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned total amount of issuance and the total amount of reserves were found to be consistent by the Monthly Committee of the Inspection Team of this Committee. This is hereby announced. Gold Certificate Issuance Reserve Management Committee, Ye Fuxiao, Zhu Yunqing."</p>
<h3>Measures for Interest Payment on Gao Mansion Relief Bonds Determined</h3>

The Municipal Government, after considering the situation, has decided on the interest payment method, namely: Those who paid in April will be paid interest for three months. Those who paid in May will be paid interest for two months. Those who paid in June will be paid interest for one month. The Finance Bureau has been ordered to follow suit.</p>

<h3>Finance Bureau's Deed Tax Revenue Increases Sharply</h3>
<p>In order to increase tax revenue, the Municipal Finance Bureau, in addition to requiring all counties under its jurisdiction to collect in-kind taxes on land in accordance with regulations, has also adjusted the deed tax. It is understood that in the previous year, the deed tax in each county was only between 2.4 and 2.5 million yuan, and in the urban area, it was only over 9 million yuan. However, it is estimated that this year, each county can collect over 45 million yuan, and the urban area can collect over 30 million yuan.</p>

<h3>Finance Bureau Increases Special Pig Tax</h3>
<p>The Municipal Finance Bureau, noting that the special pig tax is still only 2,000 yuan per pig, which is not in line with the current selling price, has decided to revise the tax amount from June 1st, increasing the special tax to 4,000 yuan per pig.</p>
<h3>Materials Distribution Office Corrects Subordinate Employees' Attitude</h3>

The directors of each issuing office have been ordered to pay close attention.</p>
<h3>City Government Approves Increased Rickshaw Rental Fees</h3>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Reconstruction previously received repeated requests from the Human-Powered Rickshaw Trade Association to increase rental fees due to soaring costs of rickshaw materials. The Bureau forwarded this request to the City Government. The City Government then convened relevant parties for consultations. Now, approval has been granted to increase the original rental price of 950 yuan by 80%, making the daily rental fee 1,700 yuan per rickshaw. Regarding speculative merchants hoarding rickshaw tires for profit, the City Government has ordered the Municipal Bureau of Economic Affairs to conduct a city-wide registration of rickshaw tire inventory.</p>
<h3>New Price Limits for Major Commodities Awaiting Study and Finalization; Price Evaluation Committee Met Yesterday</h3>

Subsequently, they convened a meeting of specialized committee members and evaluators at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 28th) to discuss the matter. Because the actual cost calculation and market conditions of several major commodities still require study and finalization, the approval of new price limits is pending a decision at the next meeting before being announced and implemented. It is reported that the prices charged by various businesses are currently without any standard, and citizens hope that the Price Evaluation Committee will quickly approve fair price limits.</p>

<h3>Views on Developing Dongting Xishan (Continued from First Page): Improving Production</h3>
<p>The significance of this population dispersal is by no means a passive act of refuge, but a transfer of Shanghai's surplus manpower for active development and construction. In this sense, those dispersed must each shoulder the responsibility of developing Xishan and increasing production. Since Xishan's food supply is not yet self-sufficient, improving production is a pressing priority.</p>
<h3>Reclaiming Wasteland</h3>
<p>Xishan covers an area of 90 "li" (approximately 45 kilometers), but only 8,985 "mu" (approximately 599 hectares) are cultivated. Vacant land, mountainous land, and marshland together total 65,518 "mu" (approximately 4,368 hectares). If scientific methods are used to reclaim and cultivate this land, planting rice, wheat, and supplementary foods such as potatoes, the projected yield can be increased tenfold compared to today.</p>
<h3>Improving Production Technology</h3>
<p>The backwardness of rural living technology is common throughout China. If production technology cannot be improved, increasing production will be like trying to catch fish by climbing a tree. Although Xishan is near Shanghai, it still retains the characteristics of ancient Chinese rural society. Cultivation relies solely on human labor. If simple machinery and animal power can be used, and fertilizer is applied, the production rate will definitely increase. As for fruit trees, if the varieties can be improved and pests prevented, the yield can also be greatly increased. If silkworms and tea leaves can be cultivated and raised using scientific methods, the yield will be significant. As for coal mines, if modern methods are used for excavation, a large amount of production can be obtained with a small amount of labor. In this way, even if Xishan's food supply is insufficient, it can exchange the output of fruits, silkworms, tea leaves, and coal for the food it needs.</p>
<h3>Establishing Schools</h3>
<p>Xishan has a beautiful environment, with clear mountains and waters, isolated from the bustling city, making it an ideal educational environment. Xishan currently has two district-run complete elementary schools, eight township elementary schools, and two private schools, with a total of over 1,500 students, which can accommodate the local school-age children. However, once population dispersal is announced, establishing schools will be necessary. One issue is the education of school-age children who are dispersed with their parents. The second issue is dispersing a portion of Shanghai's secondary schools and even colleges to establish joint secondary schools or universities. However, to adapt to the local situation and meet actual needs, in addition to establishing ordinary schools, I believe that establishing vocational schools and short-term vocational training schools is essential. Let's discuss them separately:</p>
<h3>Establishing Ordinary Schools</h3>
<p>The education problem is an important issue that must be solved simultaneously with the dispersal problem. The country cannot be without education for a day. Therefore, the government should solve the education problem for the children of those being dispersed. One solution is for the government to open primary and secondary schools locally to accommodate school-age children. Another solution is to plan ahead and, in preparation for any eventuality, have the government initiate the dispersal of a portion of municipal secondary school students and library equipment to start classes (because elementary school students must move with their parents, it is better to start with dispersing secondary schools first). At the same time, the government should encourage and assist private schools to implement dispersal, and if necessary, enforce it.</p>
<h3>Establishing Vocational Schools</h3>
<p>In this time of frequent wars and material shortages, when increasing production is paramount, the government has clearly ordered the promotion of vocational education. To develop Xishan's resources and train production personnel, establishing vocational schools in Xishan is particularly necessary. Vocational schools can be divided into two types: One is to train basic production personnel by establishing junior and senior vocational schools, with departments such as group art, animal husbandry (including poultry), and silk production. The other is to train talent for developing Xishan and improving production. Vocational training schools can be established to recruit adult men and women and teach them various life and aesthetic skills so that they can take on the task of increasing production. The results are easily seen, and the benefits will be significant. This can be asserted with certainty.</p>
