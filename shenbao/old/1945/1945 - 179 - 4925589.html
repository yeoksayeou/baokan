<h3>峇厘巴板化為焦土　日守軍準備邀擊　附近海上尋艦等三艘轟沉</h3>
<p>南方某基地二十七日中央社電　日軍航空部隊攻擊隊，二十五日薄暮，對峇厘巴板近海　動中之敵海上部隊，加以果敢之痛擊，計轟沉其巡洋艦二艘，巡洋艦或驅逐艦一艘，此外，並擊中其二萬噸級之大型油槽船一艘。</p>
<p>西南太平洋基地二十七日中央社電　著名秀　都市，日具有特異情趣之峇厘巴板，亦遭敵連續達二十日之轟炸，該地因前遭達十日之艦砲射擊，早已完全化爲焦土戰塲，敵之焦土土戰術久有準備，十五日正午，敵艦艇首先出現於峇厘巴板海面時，預爲準備邀　待機而動之日守備軍將士，與猛烈奮鬥之國民義勇軍，俱奮勇爭先於敵之猛烈轟炸下，聯合組成整齊之部隊應戰，而待避中之住民姿態，亦於敵機機槍掃射下，大多協力運輸重要物資於守軍之各種工作，并於極度緊張之空氣中，進行不稍怠慢。蓋因每日自上午九時至下午三時，敵機頻來作波狀空襲，而運輸正於此時中進行，敵之艦砲射擊已成爲今日之課程矣。於敵之轟擊下，始終死守砲陣之日砲兵，其勇敢精神，大有敵若登陸，則誓必予敵以一當十之犧牲氣概。且作戰隊員，因最高指揮官於陣前指揮，更給予全體將士以莫大興奮，雖敵機與艦艇愈益增强并登陸兵員愈多，然愈爲日守備軍將士所期望，俾成一舉殲減而擊破其企圖，現仍立於焦土中抗戰之將士，其勇猛壯烈精神，不禁令人肅然起敬。</p>
<h3>日空軍轟炸冲繩擊沉毀敵艦二艘　久米島前日有敵軍登陸</h3>
<p>前綫基地二十七日中央社電日航空部隊自二十五日夜至二十六日晨，攻擊冲繩本島附近之敵艦船及其飛機塲，此次攻擊，使敵艦種不詳者二艘被擊沉毀，飛機場二所焚燒，此外并有數機突入敵艦船。</p>
<p>中央社訊　據關島敵方廣播，臼軍現正以最優秀之飛機及駕駛員實施轟炸冲繩地區，肘制美軍利用冲繩本島基地進攻日本本土。據合衆社記者報告，日軍特攻隊已使美軍軍心動搖。</p>
<p>前綫基地二十七日中央社電　二十六日上午六時半，敵軍於冲繩本島西方九十公里之久米島登陸。</p>
<h3>大日本興亞會　昨行開會式</h3>
<p>東京二十七日中央社電大日本興亞會，爲期團結十億大東亞國民，共同展開强力之思想戰計，特於二十七日十時半，在東京九枝內會館正式舉行開會式。首由總裁松井大將致開會辭。繼由東海鍊成局長近藤英次郞中將，代理天羽副總裁兼理事長致詞　　由東鄉大東亞根致詞，其大意謂，大東亞省亦決盡全力，援助興亞會運動，余深望興亞會不負政府之期待及國民之，實踐，鍊成三局，總務局長由森喬氏就任，實踐局長由天羽副宗裁兼任，　成局長則由近藤中就任。</p>

<h3>無錫近况</h3>
<p>— 香票</p>
<p>京滬重鎮</p>
<p>無錫縣境，位處京滬路之中樞，東接常熟，南濱太湖，並交吳縣，西瀕宜興武進，北連江陰。本邑地多平坦，港　紛歧，攻守兩非所宜，負郭之惠山，亦僅風景宜人，別無險要可守，但自京滬路貫通後，以運輪上之關係，遂威京滬兩地之咽喉，是以人口稠密，全縣面積計有三千六百五十方里，　桑發達，工商實業均爲各縣冠，故有「小上海」之稱。交通方面，水路有運河太湖，陸路有錫滬，錫澄，錫宜，蘇錫等公路貫通鄰縣，故無錫實爲蘇省中交通及工商業之重鎮也。</p>
<p>人口百萬</p>
<p>本縣人口據最近之調查，其總數較事獎以前略有增加，但事變前之人口統計詳細數字，則無從查考，茲就本縣人口現狀，根據最近調查之數字：全縣共分十區，八十一鎭，一百二十六鄉，計二〇二七保，二三。八四川甲，二四九。〇七一戶，一。一一九。一四五人其中壯丁有十萬二千餘名，佔總數百分之九。二〇</p>
<p>改食雜糧</p>
<p>無錫以交通便利，教育普及，故風俗當稱馴良，惟以近年受滬上　華習俗之影響，所事流於奢侈，婚喪喜慶，崇尚虛榮，頗多無謂之糜費。生活方面，富戶自不必論，鄉間農民，自耕農差可溫飽，半自耕農已難敷衍，佃農則　飱不繼矣。昔無論貧富，一律以米爲糧，近受米優暴漲之影響，一般中下階級，大部兼食雜糧，或改爲一飯二粥，菜味重甜，烹調之術，與蘇當並駕，衣分綢布，住則一律瓦屋，間有茅　爲客民所居。</p>
<p>本邑爲各方貨物集散之區，以是工廠林立，事變以前，絲廠布廠，開設甚多。足資容納多數女工，惟事變後，工廠停頓，生活艱難，各女工謀生非易，未免流爲私娼，現經當局整肅後，尚存歌妓唱妓共二百五十餘人。</p>
<p>市面繁盛</p>
<p>城周十八里，瀕運河，爲京滬路所經，工商之盛，爲本有各縣冠。市街以北門大街爲最繁華，其次爲大市橋，會橋，淸明橋，黃坭峯，西門吊橋等處，亦均熱鬧；米麥之市，萃於北塘。通運。漢昌。諸路則以逼折火車輪船　頭而發達，工廠以西門爲多，堆棧則散立遝河兩岸，每逢米繭兩市，貿易客商，極爲　擠。</p>
<p>社會福利</p>
<p>錫邑人士，對慈善事業，頗能熱心舉辦，每屆冬令，鑒於一般貧民，啼飢號寒之古，輒有冬令施粥之舉，或設法辦理食米平售等，以資救濟，事變以還，滿目瘡痍，其顚沛流離苦况，更甚於前，幸賴各慈善團體，舉辦義賑，貧黎受惠非淺。</p>
<p>邑之北柵口中教道義會，歷年舉辦種種慈善事業，莫不有益於社會，造編於地方，迎日以來，米價狂漲，該分會見及於斯，在萬分困難之中，繼續發起平賣麵粉，救濟貧民。</p>
<p>教育發達</p>
<p>無錫爲江蘇文化發達之一縣，小學教育最盛，全境縣立小學在刷新區表，計四十八校，學生共一七。二六〇名，教職員共四百六十八人，縣立小學之在鄉區者，計七校，分佈東亭。長安。張涇。安鎭。蕩口。前洲。新　等諸鄉鐵，學生共二〇七九名，教職員五十六人。中學縣私立共九校，學生二六三三名，教職員一百五十六人。此外尙有民敎館及圖書館等社會教育之設立。</p>
<p>至於教師待遇，雖一再提高，然生活指數，日逐高昂，每至預算確定時，物價已高漲數倍，此教師生活之所以始終陷於因苦也。邇來米價已過大關，薪水階級待遇之菲薄，僅個人之飽腹終不可得，其中尤以小學教師爲更苦，當局雖極盡心力，維護教師生活，如新預算，俸米配給，戰時生活津貼等，事實上，新預算尚米成立，舊預算積欠二月，俸米粒米未得，津貼發放無期，薪金一項，小學教師每月最高不過二千元，當局雖欲整飭，實感心餘力絀，以致於上月釀成全縣教師怠課事件，現常局已設縣立教工人員生活救濟委員會，大規模勸募「教工救濟金」，目標而千萬元，對於目前縣立教工生活，不無小補，但爲永久計，應有較完善之措置。</p>
<p>師資之抵劣，固由於生活待遇不良所致，以致優良師資逃避，此僅一半原因，生要尚在師資之貧乏。</p>
<p>工商各業</p>
<p>錫邑以教育之盛，人材輩出，學者及實業家代有其人，實業教育公共事業，均有可觀，事變前，無錫與南通稱爲二模範自洽縣。</p>
<p>無錫有小上海之稱，工業之發達可知，絲廠，棉紗廠，棉織廠，針織廠，麵粉廠，榨油廠，碾米廠等，應有盡有，男女工人數達十萬，其中以棉紗業爲最大，麵粉業次之，其餘新工業如製鎂，電氣，印刷等，舊工業或手工業，則有木器，鐵器，糕糰，麵筋等。他若惠山泥人，東亭之弦錢及紙牌，塘須鎭絲綫及黃草布，靑名橋磚瓦，東南鄉之蓆，滙龍橋之竹器等，現以銷路呆滯，致產量亦少。</p>
<p>商業亦甚發達，無鍚縣城爲米絲之大集散場交通除火車及長途汽車外，尚有小輪航路以無錫縣城爲中心，與上海。蘇州。常州。江陰。溧陽。湖州等地均有往來。以米市最盛。附折武進。宜興。溧陽以及皖省之米，均策中於此，運往蘇滬浙江等地，是以常地之米價，約及上海之半數。其次爲絲，全城繭行，不下百餘家，除供本城外，則運往上海，故市况甚盛</p>
<p>宣　工作</p>
<p>先天道在錫武澄虞地區開始活動以來，瞬已四月餘，一般農民誤信刀槍不入，肆言佛力保家，費時失業，妨害地方治安，政府當局爲顧念民生，防止事態擴大起見，爰將先天道重要份子十三人，斷然予以扣留，一面由省方保安司令部組織勦匪指揮部，展開宣撫工作，並迭經曉論，大致改邪歸正，繳出所有大刀矛槍，以備改製農具，尚有少數道徒，存在偏僻鄉鎭，彼等担憂武器繳出後，個人生命無保障，蓋恐受遊擊隊及不法軍警之報復也。</p>
<p>農業增產</p>
<p>土地肥沃，夏季高熱多雨，冬季低　乾燥，爲栽培稻麥最適宜之地，故本縣發作物以麥稱爲主要產品，此外育　養魚，亦爲本縣農村之兩大副業，乾蠶年　約四萬七千餘担，魚類約一萬五千餘担。本年春蠶飼育，以天時調順，　兒發育經過頗佳，絕少病否發現，對於農村經濟，賴此副業亦得稍蘇矣。四鄉農民於脫售鮮　後，經濟活潑，更以育　之後，桑樹皮亦爲副產物品，常地各洋行均趨競購，用作織維原料，獲利不貲，最近期間，四鄉農民均從事於刈麥與插秧，工作頗爲緊張。</p>
<p>園藝作物之茭白西瓜等，亦輸出蘇滬一帶，雪浪山之茶，以品質優良著稱，礦產極少，僅西南部所產陶土，可製瓦缶及一切日用品。水產　僥，太湖白魚銀魚爲最著名。</p>
<p>農業增產生在縣方設有「農業增產業進委員會」，爲推進本縣農業增產之中心機構，其他農業改進區，中國合作社無錫支社，及一切增產事業　均爲實施之機關，惟各機構經費有限，故尙末能充分實現也。</p>
<p>本年度增產計劃大政分爲：　開墾荒地，以除去地面障礙物，然後播土。　利用鐵路沿綫空閒地，用以播種甘　玉蜀黍萬蔴及蔬菜等。　在第一，六，七，八各區設立示　及特約農場，作為稻麥及甘　等六　作示範。　在七八九各區舉行耕種改善指導獎勵事業，包括秧田改良，選種改良，施肥改善等。　防除螟虫。　改良麥作指導獎勵事業。　　工品，　　，蔬菜等致增產。　甘　栽培，麻作推廣，牛猪羊種蓄設置，購置脫榖機等。　舉行副業講習會及農業增產指導員訓練。</p>
<p>增產工作以蓖蔴種植之成績較　良，去年每畝可得二担，農民所得利潤亦厚，故今年推廣較易。最近尚在繼績指導雜糧甘緖之種　及秧田之除　除　，並麥作選種。</p>
<p>至於農村貸金，向未舉辦，前僅有合作社推行之「水道肥料貸款」，以農具及肥料貸給農民，至收成時按市價以農產品還款，成績尚佳。</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>舊金山會議閉幕</h3>
<p>喧傳一時釣舊金山會議，自木年四月二十五日開幕，業於日昨（二十六日）閉幕，歷時兩月，經過了幾次驚風馭濤，瀕於破裂，總算最後因美總統特魯曼私人代表台維斯及霍浦金二人分往英蘇首都游說，勉强打破僵局，至本月爾十三日完成新國際組織所謂「聯合國」憲章。據舊金山訊，此次新憲章於本月二十五日在舊金山聯合國大會中正式通過，立即飛傳至該會議參加國五十國的首都，要求予以批准，至二十六日即由各國代表正式簽字。是日下午由美總統特魯曼致閉會詞後，宣告閉幕。</p>
<p>所謂新國際組織「聯合國」　章成立以後，聯合國的今後任務，當然就是這個國際組織之籌備成立。爲此目的，舊金山會議業已決議或立「聯合國」籌備委員會，除了籌備所謂「聯合國」的成立大會之外，並負責籌備此「聯合國」的直屬國際組織，即安全保障理事會，秘書處，國際法庭及社會與經濟評誠會等。該籌備委員會預定於舊金山會議閉幕後，即在舊金山召開第一次聯合國籌備委員會，然後即移至倫敦舉行，而且按舊金山會議所通過的該籌備委員會的協定九條，暗示今後新國際組織「聯合國」的第一次全體代表大會，亦將在英國境內召集，似乎今後的國際時局焦點，又要移回歐洲去了。</p>
<p>然而，無論如何，這種被誇張宣傳的新國際組織，是非常不完全的畸形機構，第一，因爲它完全是由所謂五大强國支配的；日前瑞典京城發出的日本記者通訊巾，更構之爲「國際聯盟之改惡版」。第二，因爲它完全忽視了太平洋區域全部國家及民族，只有重慶和菲律賓，當然不能代表全體東亞國家及民族，而未來世界和平與安全之保障，顯然決不能漠視東亞，第三，德　兩國，據說將久遠無法以平等資格參加「聯合國」，而西班牙在政體不改變的條件之下也不許參加，其他尚有許多中立國如瑞典，葡萄牙等國也沒有參加，誰也不能相信，這種偏狹的國際政治機構，可以担負起保障世界和平與安全的重任。</p>
<p>在國際新組織「聯合國」尚未發揮其國際安全保障機構的機能以前，業已依據舊金山會議的決定，設立中間執行委員會爲過渡性的國際　　，據本月二十二日美國國務鄉史蒂丁紐斯稱，執行委員會將在倫敦辦公，委員爲蘇聯，英。美。法。重慶。伊。）伊朗四國代表，對於今後國際問題即將參與審議。但在此國際問題嚴重性方興未艾之時，實際上仍將光先由即將舉行的三頭會議先行折衝。因此，今日與其重視舊金山會議通過的憲章及所謂「聯合國」的過渡機構，實際上還不如注目於史太林。特魯曼及邱吉爾的三頭會議，而他們最大的矛盾之點，就是這種所謂「世界和平與安全的煌煌宣誓，完全是非現實的，因爲正在東亞肆行暴虐之屠殺與破壞罪行的英美，而竟侈　和平與文明，不能不說是人類的恥辱。</p>
<p>們更廻顧第一次世界大戰後訂立的凡爾賽和約，不但不能維持世界的和平，祇成爲强國宰割弱小的武器。根據這條約而成立的國際聯盟，不但不能保障國際的安全，而祇成爲保障强國利益的御用機構。那末我們對於此次舊金山會議中艱難產生，百補千綻的所謂「憲章」與「安全保障組織」，實在不能予以更高的</p>
<p>締結凡爾賽條約與組成國際聯盟的結果，是造成二三十年後如火如荼的被壓迫民族爭取自由的運動，因此而有此次大戰。在今日，很明顯地，聯合國彼此的矛盾愈益尖銳化，表現在舊金山會議中的如波蘭問題，表決權問題等。誠所謂糾紛百出，我們不難想像，在今後的幾年中，英美蘇問將產生何等形勢，也不難想像，被欺凌，被宰割的戰敗國弱小與列强間，將發生何等後果。</p>
<h3>浙丁省長　蒞蘇垣公幹</h3>
<p>蘇州二十七日中忠社電　浙省長丁默邨氏，於日前普京述職後，復於日昨蒞蘇　公幹。本省任省長孫建　長等中日各要人，均赴站迎　。丁氏下車後，即赴省府休息，編以中央常務委員資格，出席蘇省省選大會，並致訓辭。任省長特於省府鴛鴦廳設筵歡宴，各廳處局長均出席作陪。席間並就蘇浙兩省確保治安物資交流等問題，作詳細商洽，結果頗爲圓滿。丁氏因應要公，不克久留，即於當日赴滬轉杭。</p>
<h3>延安召開　人民大會　與渝分庭抗禮</h3>
<p>中央社滬訊　據到達此間之延安消息：延安政權於二十一日召開陝甘寧邊區各派代表會議，席間邊區政府主席林祖涵曾提出討論于中共七全大會時毛澤東政治報告演說中所稱：「中國解放地區之人民代表會議，應述即召開」，該提案業經討論通過。同時並稱，即時組成召集人民代表會議之準備委員會。按召集該會議，乃表示延安政權爲與十一月十二日淪方召開之國民大會對抗者也。</p>
<h3>緬甸喜丹河綫　日軍勇戰中　南揮部高原亦布堅陣</h3>
<p>緬甸前綫基地二十六日中央社電緬甸日軍現整理戰綫，並重整陣容告畢，於喜丹河一綫，阻止企圖東進之英印軍，刻正勇戰中。又於南揮高原方面，加羅東方三角地帶，庇古山　布成堅陣，以阻止敵軍之進擊企岡，刻下緬甸戰綫因雨季泥濘載途，無大軍衝突，僅有前哨部隊小接觸而已。敵軍於密林障道之南　部高原方面企圖東進，日軍精銳部隊會書夜派遺衝殺隊奇　敵軍，以　肘敵軍進擊。又於伊洛瓦底江二角地帶之塔拉第吉東南方及東北方之三角地區，亦有日軍衝殺隊奇襲敵陣，使其重大　　，敵方報道方面亦承認日軍之奪戰。據新德里廣播稱，塔拉瓦第戰綫，現因水勢汜濫及日軍之強烈砲火所阻，故攻擊極爲困難。又印度聯合通訊社前綫特派員亦稱，日軍似於喜丹河東岸布成堅陣，重整武器，其裝備優秀，且有強力砲兵活動。</p>
<p>蘇省府限各縣完成自衛設施</p>
<p>蘇州二十七日中央社電省府以各縣辦理人民自衛設施工事，迭經令飭速辦，茲以各縣對是項工作迄未成功，如是玩忽，殊屬不合，現爲增强自衛工作促速完成起見，特訂定各縣人民自衛設施暫行辦法一種，昨已通飭各縣遵辦，務于本月底前，全部建築完成。</p>
<p>派員指導滅蝗蘇州人體十七日中央社電　蘇省農業增產策　委員會兼主委孫育才氏，對本省境內鎭江江寗句容江浦等縣，入夏以來發現蝗蝻，爲害農業，故頗爲關心，乃於日前指派吳科長等分往發現地區，加以指導撲減，聞奉派人員已與各地方縣長區長依照規定撲減防治辦法，進行捉捕工作。</p>

<p>美國務院入員將有重要調動</p>
<p>中央社訊　據華府廣播：紐約時報稱，三頭會議將於七月舉行，傳特魯曼總統將任命前最高等法院法官貝爾納斯爲國務鄉，史蒂丁紐斯爲駐英大使兼聯合國臨時委員會主席。又財政部長　根　一　下月第七次戰時公債招募工作告竣，亦將去職，內政部長伊克斯亦將辭任。又史蒂丁紐斯及貝爾納斯二人，前曾充羅斯福總統之隨員，出席雅爾達會議，故本屈三頭會議舉行時，預料亦將隨特魯曼總統出席。</p>
<h3>「新國際機構」　——構成及機能之內容——</h3>
<p>東京二十七日中央社電舊金山會議二十四日曾發表聯合國機構憲章全文，於憲章中所規定之新國際機構之橋成及機能之內容如次：</p>
<p>名稱——「聯合國，」「聯合國」者，實含有與以往完全不同之意思，亦即並非僅指果共同敵國交戰之國家集團，乃具有恒久性處理國際問題之世界機構。此機構確較過去之國際組織進）步，蓋若取舊「國際聯盟」體騐比較之，則現在之組織，實較略爲優良。機構之常設地雖尚未決定，但常置本部之所在地，將置於不屬任何一國，而爲類似世界領之「超越區域」。各機關雖非全體均持有獨立之地位，但機構任何之內部分，別特具明確之責任分野。茲將各機關之構成及任務錄下：</p>

<p>總會係以加盟國各五名以下之代表所蠻成，投票據爲一國一票，憲章修正資格國爲參加舊金山會議批准憲章之國，而總會基於安全保障理事會之推　，可得承認新加盟國。定例會議爲每年一次，但亦可於總會召集臨時會議，由安全保障理事會之非常務理事國及信託統治理事國之常務理事會會員，選舉國際機構事務德長，參加選舉國際司法裁判所推事，並對其他機構部門之報告加以檢討，討論憲章中規定範圍內一切國際問題，且可予以　吿，但關於安全保障理事會審議中之問題，不能參加意見。</p>

<p>經濟社會理事會　　該會以總會所選舉之十八國構成，其目的在於促進及提高人權及人類之福社。並求聯合國之機構與各種特殊國家間機構之聯　。理事國得設立包括國際人民憲章起草委員會及其必要之附屬委員會，該委員會受總會直　指揮。</p>
<p>國際信　統治委員會</p>
<p>該會由有信託統治領團家與無信託統治領國家之數目相等理事國所構成。安全保障理事會之五常務理事國，得參加任何諸地域，而此日後締結之協定分別置於委任統治之下。理事會得受理統治各國提出之報告並檢討之，且遵守統治條件，考核各領土及其他一切問題，　非建立人民智福社爲光決條件計劃其統治事項。理事會於總會之管轄下，若遇戰安全保障關係問題時，則對安全保障理事會可提出報告。</p>

<p>各地域代理機關　　除依靈章指定設置各機關後，且須依安全保障體制，及阿刺伯國家聯盟形式，使各種地域機關全面協力，而憲章上亦特承認此種地域機關之價值及其意義。且此項新機構於安全保障理事會開始干涉前，隨時皆可對各種侵略行為有自衛權力。</p>
<h3>波流亡政府　發表宣言</h3>
<p>瑞典京城二十七日中央社電據此間接獲消息；倫敦波蘭流亡政府昨日頒發宣言，並將該宣言　呈至各聯合國政府（聯政府除外），極力對華沙之新波蘭聯合政府表示抗議。略謂：所謂波蘭臨時聯合政府者，實一極不合法之組織，此不合法政府宜將一切機力，移交至組織於自由波蘭領土內且在選舉時足能代表民意之政府當局。聯合國亦曾有公告指明，由於佔得波蘭領土大半之國家人員，以及由英美兩國大使所組成之波蘭解放委員會，業有權組織一波蘭國之正式政府云云。然現在波蘭臨時政府建立之際，正值全部波蘭領土被蘇維埃軍隊佔據之時，亦正值全部波蘭民衆已彼奪去人民公權之際，故波蘭臨時政府之設立，實爲不法之舉也。同時該項宣言復駁斥達反正義之蘇聯陰謀，不法　捕波蘭秘密運動之要人，日加以獨斷之審判。</p>
<h3>美在歐戰中　物資損失</h3>
<p>中央社訊　據華府廣播，美陸軍部二十五日發表：對德對義戰役中，美陸軍於海上喪失物資五十三萬七千六百五十六噸，此數等於滿載物資之萊巴提型貨船五十四艘，其中有自美國開赴歐洲之船　一百五十艘在途中被擊沉，十艘被擊毀，船隻及人員之損失，業已正式發表。上項損書僅爲外洋輸赴歐洲。地巾海。中東。北大西洋。南大西洋。及拉丁美洲等地之美輪及外輪之損失。太平洋方面之陸軍物物資損失，尙不包括在內。又國內戰域之損害，因調查未竣，亦未包括在內。據稱：物資之喪失，大抵起因德義軍之　擊，船舶七十四艘遭遇辨水八　被轟炸，四艘原因不詳。據格蕾斯少將之發表，專作貨船用之輪船喪失九十一艘，其他損害爲油船七，軍隊運送船二，客員運送船四，共他一艘。被擊破之十艘中，五艘爲貨船，三艘爲油船，一艘爲軍隊運輸船，一艘爲客員及貨物輸送船。</p>

<h3>市建設局改善路政設施　積極從事修補路面工作</h3>
<p>市區境內道路，年來失於修理，以致損壞程度日甚一日，車輛行駛頗感不便，市建設局成立後，即注意及此，力謀改善路政，惟因限於經費，只能儘量利用該局之長工及存料，積極從事修補路面，以塡補凹潭為主要工作。</p>
<p>修補工作積極進行</p>
<p>此項工作，分散各處，每一處所之工人，為數不多，每易為人所忽視，其中早已興工，而目下尙在修理中者，計有南京路·北京路·大同路·靜安寺路·泰山路·江寗路·長寗路·鉅鹿路·淳化路·協和路·西體育會路·江灣路·維新路乖。即將開始修理者，計有金陵路·大興路·洛陽路·吳淞路·長治路·東長治路等。同時因事實上之需要，該局並曾協助市府近郊公路委員會修築本市近郊各路，如大民路·騰佩路·共榮路·交通路·虹橋路·畑路等，計長三十餘公里。目下該局所深感困難者，約有數端：　工人待遇菲薄，生活維艱，工作效率不無減低。　所有工具類多陋舊損壞，無力添修。　需用之煤水易購得。　運輸工具深感不缺乏。以上各點正由該局妥籌辦法補救，一旦獲得解決，則路政之推進，自可望更進一步</p>
<p>擬就滬西防水計劃</p>
<p>構渠問題，較為複雜，對於馬路積水之根本解決，非市府目下財力所能勝任，聞建設局巳擬就滬西防水計劃及預算，在治標中兼顧治本，業巳呈請市府核示中。目前路旁開掘個人防空洞，係　由各聯保處負責辦理，所有該項防空洞不妥之點，建設局早經明悉，已通知各有關當局設悉，已通知各有關當局設法加以改善。</p>
<p>滬蘇公路修築工程</p>
<p>修築蘇滬公路工程，係由修築公路工程處招標辦理，業已開工，共分三段，分設段工程事務所於眞茹，南翔及黃渡三地。每職工約十餘人，派學識經騐俱富之工程師長駐各該段，臨督工事之進行。目下工程進展之情况，尙稱滿意。</p>
<p>修理極橋　即可興工</p>
<p>山西路橋及福建路橋，茲經修竣暫通行人，使之加固通行車輛之計劃及預算，正在編具，不日可呈府核示。河南路橋，四川路橋之修理計劃，四川路橋之修理計劃，業經屯府核准，現正覓鋼板，購到後即可興工。</p>
<p>最近有建議以罪犯乞丐及無業流民等使之從事市政建設工作者，據悉建最當局，亦曾加以考慮，認為立意固佳，無如本市道路大都為柏油路面，工人非有相當之技術不可。其他如房屋或橋　之修建工程，尤非熟練之技工不為工。欲以上述人等從事於是項工作，自非經過長時期之訓練不能用，且烏合之衆，又多老弱殘庸，管理方面，稍有疏失，非獨曠時費日，抑且耗材料，勢將得不償失。</p>
<h3>財局解釋房捐計徵法</h3>
<p>市財政局此次按照調整房捐徵收辦法，開徵夏季房　，一般住戶不明計徵方法，　欵佔價錯誤，紛請解釋。據財局負責人員稱：此次調整房捐，係照二十六年房租佔價標美人計所徵書之房捐數額計算，升為原數二百五十倍，仍照二十六年原捐率百分之十四徵收，幷非以當時實在房捐數額計算，因佔價房租具有客觀性，頗為公允等語。深望各住戶加以注意，勿再有所誤會。</p>
<p>竹木業稅牙行代征</p>
<p>市財政局為整頓稅政，節省公幣起見，巳將竹木黨業專稅稽徵處撤銷，關於上項專稅，改由牙行負責代徵竹木柴炭營業稅，並聞牙行代徵竹木炭營業稅自本年七月一日起開徵。</p>
<h3>金證劵抵押可作現金用　並可作為支付存款準備金</h3>
<p>中央儲備銀行金證劵發行已達四期，出售數量，成績極佳頗受一般金融各界及商民倍仰。第一期及第二期金證劵到期後，持劵人前往領兌黃金者固多，而以金證劵即黃金之信念，持劵人願藏金劵不欲亟予領兌黃金者亦復不少，茲聞中儲當局為便利一般金融機關執有金證劵而調劑其資金運用起見，對於金證劵抵押可作現金之用，各金融機關並可作為支付存款準備金之用。</p>
<p>中儲允許</p>
<p>本市中儲銀行及銀聯會錢凖庫所備各銀行錢莊領用之撥款單，已定於七月三十日起一律停止使用，銀錢兩業各大會員行莊，屆時每日所需之現鈔頭寸，刻正積極商討，並向中儲當局請求中。據金融界方面透露：金融主管當局為防止信用膨脹，故停止撥款單行使，改用平行橫綫本票，除絕對愼重開發外，而其所備之現鈔自不能不未雨而綱繆，此銀錢業已於口頭向中儲請求後，一面並擇其本月十九日之風平浪靜之一日，分由各行莊照表愼列是日「往來活期存款數目表」，內分：　活期存款，　往來存款，　特種活期存款等，存入及支付數額。此外，並另附職工員役開支膳食等表，由銀錢業公會分別彚集，向中儲當局提出書畫要求，增加每日領劵（現鈔）數額，大致錢業每日約在四萬萬元左右，銀行業每日約在十萬萬元以上，已予允許，所待考慮者，僅為數額上增減問題，預計於本月底以前，該項請求，可獲圓滿解決。</p>
<h3>經濟局取締非法推銷煤球</h3>
<p>查本市戶口煤球配給停頓後，市民所需悉仰黑市，其價格亦隨各主要日用品，騰漲不已，所有品質，大率不及標凖。近日報載，南市陸家浜路一三二九號大中華煤球廠通吿，配售全市特種煤球。特往叩經濟當局，承吿以戶口煤球，以原料缺乏，下期配給，暫無定期。至關於大中華煤球廠，擅用佈吿式文字，推銷製品，並憑居住證購買實屬不合。</p>
<p>且大中華以商人立塲，輕言配給，悖　莫甚。本局業已嚴予取締。</p>
<h3>糖業聯營社下月初成立</h3>
<p>上海區食糖業公會籌備組織之上海糖業聯營社，自經辦理社員申請登記，現已超過原定數額。茲悉該社定於下月初正式成立，關於該社之運營要務為：　本市配給戶口食糖之處理。　食糖之採購及分配。　其他有關食糖及管理。</p>

<h3>各縣會議決議案應專案呈核</h3>
<p>市政府以本市所屬各縣區舉行各種會議，往往僅送會議紀錄，籠統呈絯，對於各個決議事項內容如何，步驟如何，以及於施行上有無其他窒礙，輒感無從查核，為認眞督導起見，爰於此次縣政管理處召集各縣區行政會議時，由主管科提議，各縣區各種會議決議事項，應分別專案呈核，當經決議通過，現已由縣管處呈府通飭所屬遵照。</p>
<h3>定海沈家門綫輪船開航</h3>
<p>中華輪船公司對於各綫航輪，自經本月恢復通航以求，非僅行旅便利，尤以暢通各地物資之輸運，成效更鉅。茲悉該公司鑒於浙東海岸如定海，沈家門等處，為海產區域。爰由該公司劃為航綫範圍，現巳分班開航，每星期可往返一班，除運唯心論外並兼搭乘客。</p>
<h3>交行複查農貸</h3>
<p>交通銀行為調劑農村經濟，增强生產；自經前奉舉辦農村貸款以來，雖經貸款資金總額限制關係，未能擴展農貸範圍，但原有已經貸出農產區之資金，已獲促進增加農產之效果。迄今止上海，嘉興，蘇州，無錫，東台等各區農經貸放企業及增產各貸款數額，相當鉅大。聞該行以各農處辦理企業增產各貸款戶額增多，當時調查監放等事，均派員前往各地區辦理誠恐或有疏忽，各農貸處應親自辦理複查，對於企業貸款應逐戶詳查，增產貸款應分批逐戶辦理抽查。同時對於到期貸款，應派員從速嚴切催收，不可任其逾期</p>

<h3>本市疏散委員會最近工作概况</h3>
<p>本市人口疏散委員會成立以來，對疏散機構之組織，交通工具之準備及對疏散目的地之調查諸項工作，進行不遺餘力。刻又着手慈善團體之强制疏散，關於該會駐申報社一部份工作情形如次：</p>
<p>先後成立各種機構</p>
<p>該會調查設計組連絡組兩組，自三月初旬假申報社辦公以來，迄今巳有三月，以事務上之需要，先後成立航空陸路兩委員會，專門辦理租借交通工具事宜，航路委員會聘王叔賢為主任。陸路委員會聘　敬齋為主任。嗣以王主任叔賢另有職務，不克兼顧航路委員會，遂亦由黃主任兼主其事。並設問訊處一所，以供解答市民對疏散于織有所不明各情。嗣以各方接洽已有頭緒，疏散工作即將實施，即在咸陽路七二三號成立汽車站，西藏路北蘇州路中央市塲成立臨時碼頭，並辦事處。同時疏散目的點亦須決定，當經分別派員視察與調查結果，僉認蘇州洞庭西山歷經戰事未遭損失，堪為理想疏散目的地。為期與江蘇省政府連絡圓滑計，設立該會駐蘇州辦事處，並成立洞庭西山分辦事處。</p>
<p>航路方面工作概要</p>
<p>航路疏散人口方面，經盟邦海軍當局之熱誠協助，允予凡本會疏散人口專輪沿途關當真予以便利。嗣即進行借用船隻，承我克協會之協力，該會現有蘇北運豬隻，來滬帆船，平時每天約有二三十艘，歸途不載貨，盡可作為人口疏散之用。經該會視察後，以該豬載人似有不妥，即續向內河輪船公司商治，擬於該會司原有各航綫班輪，每班附掛民船。該公司對疏散公作極表贊助，每班附掛民船一艘，每一乘客，出費三千三百三十元（內包含租船）·拖船·燃料·人工及沿途雜用各項）刻正陸續辦理疏散中。凡市民欲疏散赴蘇者，可赴該會執行組各分辦事處（前巳見報，如大厦六樓保甲處詢問。）登記。</p>
<p>陸路方面工作概要</p>
<p>陸路委員會成立後，首設汽車總站一所，俾一有車輛即可集中　車，汽車站於四月初經市建設局協助，准予借用，咸陽路七二三號一部份廣塲，作為停車之用。一方面擬借用法商公共汽車公司停置不用紅色公共汽車，作為疏散交通工具，嗣因該項車輛另有用途中止。繼即呈請市府轉飭建設局向本市汽車輸業公會徵用車輛。為顧念商艱，在可能範圍內，仍擬償貼車商車輛消耗，使無損害，現在徵用車輛事宜，正商請建設局辦理中，對長途卡車之租借亦設法進行。於六月五日召集各卡車行談話，獲悉除一部份小汽車不適疏散之用外，其可能為該會租用者數量不多。據調查所得，專駛無錫·常熟·松江諸地車輛全部僅四五十輛。經商談後，車商允於每一星期抽調卡車五輛協助，所有開支消耗皆由車商負責，疏散決定依此辦法進行，光試駛蘇州·常熟·崑山·靑浦·松江等綫。視事實可能，再徐為擴展路綫，現靜候執行組登記疏散市民，一埃集有成數即可駛行。此外，如華北各地方人民之疏散歸鄕，巳向華中鐵道公司折衝，附掛疏散專節車輛，以利疏散，不久即可實現。</p>

<p>From a Certain Southern Base, 27th (Central News Agency Telegram) – On the 25th, at dusk, a Japanese army air force attack squadron launched a resolute and fierce assault on enemy naval forces operating off the coast of Balikpapan, sinking two cruisers and one cruiser or destroyer. In addition, a large 20,000-ton oil tanker was also hit.</p>
<p>From a Southwestern Pacific Base, 27th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Balikpapan, the famous and charming city cherished by the Japanese, has also suffered continuous bombing by the enemy for twenty days. Having previously endured ten days of naval bombardment, the area has already been completely reduced to a scorched battlefield. The enemy's scorched-earth tactics have long been anticipated. When enemy ships first appeared off the coast of Balikpapan at noon on the 15th, the Japanese garrison, prepared for an ambush and awaiting the moment to strike, along with the fiercely fighting National Volunteer Corps, bravely stepped forward to fight alongside them under heavy enemy bombardment, forming an organized force. The residents, seeking shelter, also largely cooperated in transporting important supplies to the garrison amidst the enemy aircraft's strafing, proceeding without the slightest negligence in an atmosphere of extreme tension. Every day, from 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM, enemy aircraft frequently launch wave-like air raids, and transportation is carried out during this time. Enemy naval bombardment has become a daily routine. The Japanese artillery, steadfastly defending their positions under enemy bombardment, display a courageous spirit, determined to sacrifice themselves ten to one if the enemy lands. Furthermore, the presence of the highest commander directing operations at the front greatly inspires all soldiers. Although enemy aircraft and warships increase in number and more troops land, the Japanese garrison anticipates this, aiming to annihilate them in one fell swoop and thwart their plans. The brave and heroic spirit of the soldiers fighting in the scorched earth commands respect.</p>

<h3>Recent Situation in Wuxi</h3>
<p>— Xiang Piao</p>
<p>Important Town Between Nanjing and Shanghai</p>
<p>Wuxi County is located at the heart of the Nanjing-Shanghai railway line, bordering Changshu to the east, Taihu Lake to the south, and connecting with Wuxian County, bordering Yixing and Wujin to the west, and connecting with Jiangyin to the north. The county is mostly flat terrain, with many streams, making it unsuitable for defense. Huishan Mountain, located outside the city, is only suitable for scenery and has no strategic importance. However, since the Nanjing-Shanghai railway line was built, Wuxi has become a transportation hub between Nanjing and Shanghai. As a result, the population is dense. The county has a total area of 3,650 square li. Silk and mulberry farming is developed, and industry and commerce are the best in the counties, hence the name "Little Shanghai". In terms of transportation, there are canals and Taihu Lake by waterway, and expressways such as Xihu, Xicheng, Xiyi, and Suxi highways connect neighboring counties, so Wuxi is indeed a transportation and industrial and commercial center in Jiangsu Province.</p>
<p>Population of One Million</p>
<p>According to the latest survey, the total population of the county has slightly increased compared to before the Incident, but detailed population statistics before the Incident are not available. The county is currently divided into ten districts, eighty-one towns, and one hundred and twenty-six townships, totaling 2,027 pao, 23,814 jia, 249,071 households, and 1,119,145 people, of which there are more than 102,000 able-bodied men, accounting for 9.20% of the total.</p>
<p>Changing Diet to Mixed Grains</p>
<p>Wuxi has convenient transportation and universal education, so the customs can be called docile. However, in recent years, due to the influence of Shanghai customs, things have become extravagant, and weddings, funerals, and celebrations all value vanity, which is a lot of unnecessary waste. In terms of life, the wealthy families are of course fine. The farmers in the countryside, the self-cultivating farmers are barely warm and full, the semi-self-cultivating farmers have difficulty making ends meet, and the tenant farmers do not even have enough to eat. In the past, regardless of the rich or the poor, rice was the staple food. Recently, affected by the soaring price of rice, the general middle and lower classes mostly eat mixed grains, or change to one meal and two bowls of porridge. The dishes are heavily sweetened, and the cooking skills are comparable to those of Suzhou and Wuxi. The clothes are silk and cloth, and the houses are all tile-roofed houses, and thatched houses are occasionally inhabited by guest people.</p>
<p>Brothels</p>
<p>The city is a distribution center for goods from all over the world, and there are many factories. Before the Incident, many silk and cloth factories were opened, which could accommodate a large number of female workers. However, after the Incident, the factories stopped, and life became difficult. It was not easy for the female workers to make a living, and they could not avoid becoming prostitutes. After rectification by the authorities, there are still more than 250 singers and prostitutes.</p>
<p>Prosperous Market</p>
<p>The city is eighteen miles around, bordering the canal, and is traversed by the Nanjing-Shanghai railway. The prosperity of industry and commerce is the best in the counties. The most prosperous street is North Gate Street, followed by Da Shi Bridge, Hui Bridge, Qingming Bridge, Huangni Peak, and West Gate Suspension Bridge, which are also bustling. The rice and wheat market is concentrated in Beitang. The Yun, Hanchang, and other roads have developed by forcing the train and boat docks, and factories are mostly located in the West Gate, while warehouses are scattered on both sides of the river. Whenever there are rice and silkworm cocoon markets, the trade merchants are extremely crowded.</p>
<p>Social Welfare</p>
<p>The people of Wuxi are very enthusiastic about charitable causes. Every winter, in view of the hunger and cold of the general poor people, there are often winter porridge distributions, or methods are devised to sell rice at a fair price to provide relief. Since the Incident, everything has been devastated, and the suffering of the displaced people is even worse than before. Fortunately, various charitable organizations have organized charity relief, and the poor people have benefited a lot.</p>
<p>The Middle Education Daoyi Society in Beizhakou, Wuxi, has been organizing various charitable causes over the years, all of which are beneficial to the society and have contributed to the local area. Since the welcoming of the sun, the price of rice has soared. The branch association has seen this and, in the midst of great difficulties, continued to launch the fair sale of flour to relieve the poor.</p>
<p>Developed Education</p>
<p>Wuxi is one of the counties with developed culture in Jiangsu. Primary school education is the most prevalent. There are 48 county-run primary schools in the entire county (a list of renovated districts), with a total of 17,260 students and 468 teachers and staff. There are 7 county-run primary schools in rural areas, distributed in Dongting, Changan, Zhangjing, Anzhen, Dangkou, Qianzhou, and Xinlian, with a total of 2,079 students and 56 teachers and staff. There are also 9 county-run private secondary schools, with 2,633 students and 156 teachers and staff. In addition, there are also public education facilities such as people's education halls and libraries.</p>
<p>As for the treatment of teachers, although it has been raised again and again, the cost of living is rising day by day. By the time the budget is finalized, prices have already risen several times. This is why the life of teachers has always been difficult. Recently, the price of rice has exceeded a major level. The meager treatment of salaried employees means that even their own hunger cannot be satisfied, especially for primary school teachers. Although the authorities are trying their best to maintain the life of teachers, such as the new budget, rice distribution, and wartime living allowances, in fact, the new budget has not been established, the old budget is two months in arrears, the rice has not been received, and the allowances are uncertain. The salary of a primary school teacher is no more than 2,000 yuan per month. Although the authorities want to rectify it, they feel that they are powerless, which led to a county-wide teacher strike last month. The Standing Committee has now established a County Education Workers' Life Relief Committee to raise a large-scale "Education Workers' Relief Fund", aiming for ten million yuan, which is a small help for the current life of county education workers. However, for the long-term plan, there should be more perfect measures.</p>
<p>The inferiority of teachers is due to the poor living treatment, which leads to the escape of excellent teachers. This is only half the reason, and the main reason is the lack of teachers.</p>
<p>Industry and Commerce</p>
<p>Wuxi has a prosperous education, and talents emerge in large numbers. Scholars and entrepreneurs have their own people. Industrial education and public undertakings are all considerable. Before the Incident, Wuxi and Nantong were known as two model autonomous counties.</p>
<p>Wuxi is known as Little Shanghai, and the development of industry is known. Silk factories, cotton spinning factories, cotton weaving factories, knitting factories, flour factories, oil pressing factories, rice milling factories, etc. are available, and the number of male and female workers reaches 100,000, of which the cotton spinning industry is the largest, followed by the flour industry. Other new industries such as magnesium production, electricity, and printing, and old industries or handicrafts, include woodenware, ironware, pastries, and gluten. Other products such as Huishan clay figurines, Dongting string money and playing cards, Tangxu Town silk threads and yellow grass cloth, Qingming Bridge bricks and tiles, and Southeast Township mats, Huilong Bridge bamboo ware, etc., are now in slow sales, resulting in less output.</p>
<p>Commerce is also very developed. Wuxi County is a major distribution center for rice and silk. In addition to trains and long-distance buses, there are also small-wheel routes with Wuxi County as the center, with Shanghai, Suzhou, Changzhou, Jiangyin, Liyang, Huzhou, and other places all having contacts. The rice market is the most prosperous. The rice from Wujin, Yixing, Liyang, and Anhui provinces is concentrated here and transported to Suzhou, Shanghai, Zhejiang, and other places, so the rice price in Changde is about half of that in Shanghai. The second is silk. There are no less than 100 silk cocoon firms in the entire city. In addition to supplying the city, they are also transported to Shanghai, so the market situation is very prosperous.</p>
<p>Comforting Work</p>
<p>Since the Xiantian Dao began its activities in the Wuxi-Wucheng-Yu area, it has been more than four months. The general farmers mistakenly believe that they are invulnerable to swords and guns, and freely say that the Buddha's power protects the family, which wastes time and causes unemployment, and hinders local security. In order to take care of the people's livelihood and prevent the expansion of the situation, the government authorities resolutely detained 13 important members of the Xiantian Dao, and organized a bandit suppression headquarters by the Provincial Security Command to carry out comforting work, and after repeated explanations, they generally corrected their evil ways and handed over all the broadswords, spears, and guns for conversion into agricultural tools. There are still a small number of Taoist followers who exist in remote townships. They are worried that their personal lives will not be guaranteed after the weapons are handed over, fearing retaliation from the guerrillas and illegal military police.</p>
<p>Agricultural Production Increase</p>
<p>The soil is fertile, with high heat and heavy rainfall in summer, and low temperatures and dryness in winter, making it the most suitable place for cultivating rice and wheat. Therefore, wheat is the main crop in this county. In addition, breeding and raising fish are also the two major side industries in the county's rural areas. The annual output of dry silkworms is about 47,000 dan, and the output of fish is about 15,000 dan. The spring silkworm breeding this year has been smooth with the weather, and the development of silkworm larvae has been quite good, with very few cases of disease, and the rural economy has been slightly revived by this side industry. After the farmers in the four townships sell the fresh silkworms, the economy is lively. In addition, after breeding silkworms, mulberry bark is also a byproduct, and foreign firms in Changde are all eager to buy it for use as textile raw materials, making a lot of profit. Recently, farmers in the four townships have been engaged in mowing wheat and transplanting rice, and the work is quite tense.</p>
<p>Horticultural crops such as water chestnut and watermelon are also exported to Suzhou and Shanghai. The tea from Xuelang Mountain is famous for its excellent quality. There are very few minerals, and only the pottery clay produced in the southwest can be used to make tiles and all daily necessities. Aquatic products are rare, and the whitefish and silverfish in Taihu Lake are the most famous.</p>
<p>To increase agricultural production, the county has established an "Agricultural Production Increase Promotion Committee" as the central agency for promoting agricultural production increase in the county. Other agricultural improvement zones, the Wuxi branch of the Chinese Cooperative Society, and all other agencies for increasing production are implementation agencies, but the funds of each agency are limited, so they have not been fully realized.</p>
<p>The annual production increase plan is roughly divided into: land reclamation, to remove ground obstacles and then sow soil. Utilizing vacant land along the railway line to sow sweet potatoes, corn, jute, and vegetables. Establishing demonstration and contract farms in the first, sixth, seventh, and eighth districts as a demonstration of six crops such as rice, wheat, and sweet potatoes. Holding cultivation improvement guidance and reward projects in the seventh, eighth, and ninth districts, including seedling bed improvement, seed selection improvement, and fertilizer improvement. Pest control. Improving wheat production guidance and reward projects. Increasing production of handicrafts, vegetables, etc. Sweet potato cultivation, jute promotion, setting up cattle, pig, and sheep breeding stations, and purchasing threshing machines. Holding side business lectures and agricultural production increase instructor training.</p>
<p>The results of increasing production with castor cultivation are better. Last year, each mu could yield two dan, and the farmers made a good profit, so it is easier to promote this year. Recently, we are continuing to guide the sowing of miscellaneous grains and sweet potatoes, and the weeding and weeding of seedling beds, as well as wheat selection.</p>
<p>As for rural loans, they have not yet been carried out. Previously, only the "Waterway Fertilizer Loan" promoted by the cooperative lent agricultural tools and fertilizers to farmers, and when the harvest was in, they repaid the loan with agricultural products at market prices, which was a good result.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Closing of the San Francisco Conference</h3>
<p>The much-discussed San Francisco Conference, which opened on April 25th of this year, officially closed yesterday (the 26th), lasting two months. After several perilous and near-breaking points, it finally managed to break the deadlock, thanks to the personal representatives of US President Truman, Davies and Hopkins, who traveled to London and Moscow for persuasion. On the 13th of this month, the charter of the new international organization, known as the "United Nations," was completed. According to San Francisco reports, the new charter was formally approved by the United Nations General Assembly in San Francisco on the 25th of this month and immediately telegraphed to the capitals of the 50 participating countries for ratification. On the 26th, the representatives of each country formally signed the charter. In the afternoon, President Truman delivered the closing remarks, declaring the conference closed.</p>
<p>With the establishment of the new international organization, the "United Nations," the future task of the United Nations is, of course, the preparation for the establishment of this international organization. To this end, the San Francisco Conference has resolved to establish a Preparatory Committee of the "United Nations," which will be responsible not only for preparing for the founding assembly of the so-called "United Nations" but also for preparing for the establishment of the international organizations directly affiliated with this "United Nations," namely, the Security Council, the Secretariat, the International Court of Justice, and the Economic and Social Council. The Preparatory Committee is scheduled to convene its first meeting in San Francisco immediately after the closing of the San Francisco Conference, and then move to London. Moreover, according to the nine articles of the agreement of the Preparatory Committee passed by the San Francisco Conference, the first plenary session of the new international organization, the "United Nations," will also be convened in British territory, suggesting that the focus of future international affairs will shift back to Europe.</p>
<p>However, in any case, this newly established international organization, which has been greatly exaggerated, is a very imperfect and malformed institution. First, because it is entirely dominated by the so-called five major powers. A dispatch from a Japanese reporter in the Swedish capital more bluntly calls it "a worsened version of the League of Nations." Second, because it completely ignores all countries and peoples in the Pacific region, with only Chongqing and the Philippines, which certainly cannot represent all East Asian countries and peoples. The guarantee of future world peace and security obviously cannot disregard East Asia. Third, Germany and Japan, it is said, will be unable to participate in the "United Nations" with equal status for a long time, and Spain is not allowed to participate unless its political system changes. Many other neutral countries, such as Sweden and Portugal, have also not participated. No one can believe that such a narrow-minded international political institution can shoulder the heavy responsibility of guaranteeing world peace and security.</p>
<p>Before the new international organization, the "United Nations," has brought its international security guarantee mechanism into play, an interim executive committee has already been established, based on the decision of the San Francisco Conference, as a transitional international agency. According to U.S. Secretary of State Stettinius on the 22nd of this month, the executive committee will work in London, and the committee members will be representatives from the Soviet Union, Britain, the United States, France, Chongqing, and Iran. They will participate in the deliberation of future international issues. However, at a time when the seriousness of international issues is still on the rise, the upcoming summit will still be the first to coordinate. Therefore, today, instead of focusing on the charter passed by the San Francisco Conference and the so-called transitional mechanism of the "United Nations," it is actually better to pay attention to the summit of Stalin, Truman, and Churchill. Their greatest contradiction is that this so-called "grand declaration of world peace and security" is completely unrealistic, because Britain and the United States are still engaged in brutal massacres and destruction in East Asia, and to indulge in talk of peace and civilization is nothing short of a disgrace to humanity.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we recall the Treaty of Versailles signed after World War I, which not only failed to maintain world peace but became a weapon for the great powers to divide and rule the weak. The League of Nations, established based on this treaty, not only failed to guarantee international security but became a tool to protect the interests of the great powers. Therefore, we really cannot give a higher evaluation to the so-called "charter" and "security organization" that were produced with such difficulty and patched up so many times at the San Francisco Conference.</p>
<p>The result of concluding the Treaty of Versailles and forming the League of Nations was the creation of a fiery movement for freedom by oppressed nations two or three decades later, which led to this great war. Today, it is clear that the contradictions among the members of the United Nations are becoming increasingly sharp, as manifested in the San Francisco Conference in issues such as the Polish question and the voting rights question. As the saying goes, there are countless disputes. It is not difficult for us to imagine what kind of situation will arise in the next few years between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and it is not difficult to imagine what consequences will occur between the bullied, divided, and ruled defeated nations and the great powers.</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Fight Bravely on the Shitan River Line in Burma; Southern Headquarters Also Establish Strong Positions on the Plateau</h3>
<p>Burma Frontline Base, 26th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese army in Burma is reorganizing its battle lines and has completed its regrouping. On the Shitan River line, they are resisting the British-Indian army attempting to advance eastward and are currently fighting bravely. In the Nanhui Plateau area, the eastern triangle area of Kalaw, and the Bago Yoma mountains, strong positions have been established to prevent the enemy from advancing. Currently, there are no major military clashes on the Burmese front due to the rainy season and muddy roads, with only small skirmishes between outpost troops. The enemy is attempting to advance eastward in the southern Nanhui Plateau area, obstructed by dense forests. Elite Japanese troops have repeatedly dispatched raiding parties day and night to surprise the enemy and hinder their advance. In the Irrawaddy River triangle area, southeast and northeast of Tharrawaddy, Japanese raiding parties also surprised enemy positions, inflicting heavy losses. Enemy reports also acknowledged the Japanese army's fierce battles. According to Radio New Delhi, the Tharrawaddy front is currently facing extreme difficulties due to rising water levels and intense Japanese artillery fire. A special correspondent from the United Press of India also stated that the Japanese army appeared to have established strong positions on the east bank of the Shitan River, reorganizing their weapons with excellent equipment and active powerful artillery.</p>

<h3>"New International Organization" - Contents of its Structure and Function -</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The full text of the United Nations Charter was released on the 24th at the San Francisco Conference. The structure and function of the new international organization as stipulated in the Charter are as follows:</p>
<p>Name - "United Nations." The "United Nations" contains a completely different meaning from the past. It is not merely a group of countries fighting a common enemy but a permanent world organization for handling international issues. This organization is indeed more advanced than past international organizations. If compared with the old "League of Nations," the current organization is slightly better. Although the permanent location of the organization has not yet been decided, the location of the headquarters will be in a "transcendent zone" that does not belong to any one country, similar to world territory. Although the various organs do not all have independent status, each internal part of the organization has a clear division of responsibilities. The structure and functions of each organ are recorded below:</p>
<p>General Assembly</p>
<p>The General Assembly is composed of up to five representatives from each member state. Voting is based on one country, one vote. Countries eligible to amend the Charter are those that participated in the San Francisco Conference and ratified the Charter. The General Assembly, based on the recommendation of the Security Council, can admit new member states. Regular meetings are held once a year, but the General Assembly can also convene extraordinary meetings. The non-permanent member states of the Security Council and the members of the permanent Council of the Trusteeship Council elect the Secretary-General of the international organization, participate in the election of judges of the International Court of Justice, and review reports from other organs, discuss all international issues within the scope stipulated in the Charter, and may issue recommendations. However, it cannot participate in opinions on issues under consideration by the Security Council.</p>
<p>Security Council</p>
<p>Composed of eleven countries, including the five permanent members: Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, Chongqing, and France. The other six countries must be selected with full consideration of their contributions to world security and geographical relations. The Council will be open for a long time, and the president will be self-elected at the meeting. If the Council encounters a matter of reconciliation and all means have failed, it can issue diplomatic or economic sanctions and request the subordinate Military Staff Committee to take action against the aggressor. The Military Committee may freely use the land, sea, and air forces of the member states. Decisions of the Council must be decided by a majority of seven countries, and important procedures must obtain unanimous agreement from all permanent members.</p>
<p>Economic and Social Council</p>
<p>The council is composed of eighteen countries elected by the General Assembly, and its purpose is to promote and improve human rights and human welfare and to seek liaison between the organs of the United Nations and various special national organs. The Council may establish a drafting committee for the International People's Charter and its necessary subcommittees, which are directly subordinate to the General Assembly.</p>
<p>International Trusteeship Council</p>
<p>The council is composed of an equal number of member states with and without trust territories. The five permanent members of the Security Council may participate in any regions, and agreements concluded later will be placed under mandate respectively. The Council may accept and review reports submitted by the governing countries, and comply with the terms of governance, assess all territories and other issues, and plan its governance matters with the establishment of people's welfare as the primary determining condition. The Council is under the jurisdiction of the General Assembly and may submit reports to the Security Council on matters relating to war security.</p>
<p>International Court of Justice</p>
<p>The court replaces the International Court of Justice in The Hague. The court also completely inherits all material assets of the Permanent Court of Arbitration. The International Court of Justice consists of fifteen elected judges, with the same powers as the old court. Countries that now want the court to have judicial power can sign a declaration in the court's current regulations, giving the court jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Secretariat</p>
<p>The Secretariat is responsible for all executive functions. Its members are not subject to the laws of individual countries. The Secretariat is headed by the Secretary-General, and the secretaries within the bureau are personally selected by the Secretary-General. The Secretary-General is designated by the Security Council and then elected by the General Assembly before a decision is made. In addition to performing his duties, the Secretary-General has the power to call the Council's attention to all situations that threaten world security and peace at any time.</p>
<p>Regional Agencies</p>
<p>In addition to the establishment of various organs designated in accordance with the Charter, it is also necessary to enable various regional organs to fully cooperate in accordance with the security system and the form of the Arab League, and the Charter specifically recognizes the value and significance of such regional organs. This new organization also has the power of self-defense against various acts of aggression at any time before the Security Council begins to intervene.</p>
<h3>Polish Government in Exile Issues Declaration</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to news received here, the Polish government in exile in London issued a declaration yesterday, and presented the declaration to the governments of the United Nations (excluding the Soviet government), strongly protesting the new Polish coalition government in Warsaw. It stated that the so-called Polish Provisional Government of National Unity is an extremely illegal organization. This illegal government should transfer all power to government authorities organized within free Polish territory and able to represent public opinion during elections. The United Nations also issued a statement indicating that the Polish Committee of National Liberation, composed of personnel from countries occupying most of Polish territory and by the ambassadors of Britain and the United States, is authorized to organize a formal government of Poland. However, the establishment of the current Polish provisional government is at a time when all Polish territory is occupied by Soviet troops, and all Polish people have been deprived of their civil rights. Therefore, the establishment of the Polish provisional government is an illegal act. At the same time, the declaration refuted the Soviet conspiracy to distort justice, unlawfully arrested key figures of the Polish secret movement, and arbitrarily conducted trials.</p>
<h3>U.S. Material Losses in the European War</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch - According to Washington broadcast, the U.S. Army Department announced on the 25th that in the battles against Germany and Italy, the U.S. Army lost 537,656 tons of materials at sea. This number is equivalent to 54 Liberty-type cargo ships fully loaded with materials. Among them, 150 ships departing from the United States for Europe were sunk en route, and ten were destroyed. Losses of ships and personnel have been officially announced. The above losses only account for the losses of US and foreign ships transporting materials overseas to Europe, the Mediterranean, the Middle East, the North Atlantic, the South Atlantic, and Latin America. Losses of army materials in the Pacific theater are not included. In addition, damage in the domestic war zone is also not included because the investigation has not been completed. It is said that the loss of materials was mostly caused by attacks by the German and Italian armies, seventy-four ships encountered torpedoes, eight were bombed, and the cause of four ships is unknown. According to the announcement of Major General Grace, ninety-one ships dedicated to cargo ships were lost, and other damages were oil ships seven, troop transport ships two, passenger transport ships four, and other one. Among the ten ships that were destroyed, five were cargo ships, three were oil ships, one was a troop transport ship, and one was a passenger and cargo transport ship.</p>

<h3>Municipal Police Bureau Regulates Business Hours of Various Industries; Businesses Operating Beyond Hours Will Be Punished Accordingly</h3>
<p>The Municipal Police Bureau, in order to manage the business hours of various industries, previously issued announcements No. 3 and No. 7.

Repeat offenders or those with more serious circumstances may be subject to concurrent measures of cutting off electricity, suspending business, or revoking their license.</p>
<p>(5) The punishments in the preceding paragraph will be ordered for execution by the competent branch or supervisor department of the bureau based on the facts investigated.</p>
<p>(6) Announcement No. 3 of September 6, 1944, and Announcement No. 7 of March 20, 1945, are repealed from the date of implementation of these measures.</p>
<p>(7) These measures will take effect from the date of promulgation.</p>
<h3>City Construction Bureau Improves Road Infrastructure, Actively Engages in Pavement Repair Work</h3>
<p>The roads within the city limits have been neglected for years, leading to increasingly severe damage, causing considerable inconvenience to vehicles. After its establishment, the City Construction Bureau immediately paid attention to this issue and strived to improve road administration. However, due to limited funding, it could only make the most of the bureau's existing long-term workers and stock materials to actively engage in pavement repair, with filling potholes as the primary task.</p>
<p>Active Progress in Repair Work</p>
<p>This work is dispersed across various locations, with a small number of workers at each site, easily overlooked. Among them, projects that have already started and are currently still under repair include Nanjing Road, Beijing Road, Datong Road, Jing'an Temple Road, Taishan Road, Jiangning Road, Changning Road, Julu Road, Chunhua Road, Xiehe Road, West Sports Association Road, Jiangwan Road, and Weixin Road. Projects scheduled to begin repair soon include Jinling Road, Daxing Road, Luoyang Road, Wusong Road, Changzhi Road, and East Changzhi Road. Simultaneously, due to practical needs, the bureau has also assisted the Municipal Government's Suburban Highway Committee in constructing roads in the city's suburbs, such as Damin Road, Tengpei Road, Gongrong Road, Jiaotong Road, Hongqiao Road, and Tian Road, totaling over 30 kilometers. Currently, the bureau faces several significant difficulties: The workers' wages are meager, making it difficult to make a living, which inevitably reduces work efficiency. Most of the tools are old, dilapidated, and beyond repair, with no funds for replacement. The required kerosene is not easily obtainable. There is a severe shortage of transportation. The bureau is currently devising solutions to these problems, and once resolved, further progress in road administration can be expected.</p>
<p>Plan to Formulate a Shanghai West Flood Control Plan</p>
<p>The issue of drainage ditches is more complex. Fundamentally resolving the problem of street flooding is beyond the current financial capacity of the municipal government. It is reported that the Construction Bureau has drafted a flood control plan and budget for western Shanghai, addressing both immediate and long-term needs, and has submitted it to the municipal government for review. Currently, the excavation of individual air-raid shelters along the roadsides is the responsibility of each Lianbao office. The Construction Bureau has long been aware of the deficiencies in these air-raid shelters and has notified the relevant authorities to take steps to improve them.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Suzhou Highway Construction Project</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Suzhou highway construction project is being carried out through bidding by the Highway Construction Engineering Office. Construction has already begun, divided into three sections, with section engineering offices established in Zhenru, Nanxiang, and Huangdu. Each office employs approximately ten people, with experienced engineers stationed in each section to supervise the progress of the work. The current progress of the project is considered satisfactory.</p>
<p>Repairing Bridges for Immediate Construction</p>
<p>The Shanxi Road Bridge and Fujian Road Bridge have been temporarily repaired to allow pedestrian traffic. Plans and budgets for reinforcing them to allow vehicular traffic are being prepared and will soon be submitted to the government for review. The repair plans for Henan Road Bridge and Sichuan Road Bridge have been approved by the government. They are currently seeking steel plates, and construction will begin as soon as they are acquired.</p>
<p>Recently, there have been suggestions to use criminals, beggars, and unemployed vagrants for municipal construction work. It is reported that the Construction Bureau has also considered this, recognizing that the intention is good. However, most of the roads in the city have asphalt surfaces, and workers must possess considerable skills. Other construction projects, such as houses or bridges, require skilled technicians. To employ the aforementioned individuals in these tasks would require a lengthy period of training, and a motley crowd, often composed of the elderly, the weak, and the disabled, would require careful management. Any negligence in this regard would not only waste time and effort but also consume materials, inevitably leading to losses outweighing gains.</p>
<h3>Finance Bureau Explains the Calculation Method for Property Tax</h3>
<p>The Municipal Finance Bureau is collecting the summer property tax according to the adjusted method of collecting property tax. Many households are unclear about the calculation method, and there are errors in the calculated value, and have requested explanation. According to responsible personnel from the Finance Bureau, the adjustment of property tax this time is calculated based on the property tax amount collected according to the valuation of rent in the 26th year of the Republic, and is increased to 250 times the original amount, and is still collected at the original tax rate of 14% in the 26th year. It is not calculated based on the actual amount of property tax at that time, because the valuation rent is objective and quite fair, and so on. I hope that all households will pay attention to it and avoid misunderstandings.</p>
<p>Bamboo and Wood Industry Tax Collection by Brokers</p>
<p>In order to rectify the tax administration and save public funds, the Municipal Finance Bureau has abolished the special tax collection office for the bamboo and wood industry. Regarding the above-mentioned special tax, the brokers are responsible for collecting the bamboo, wood, firewood and charcoal business tax. It is also heard that the brokers will collect the bamboo, wood and charcoal business tax from July 1st of this year.</p>
<h3>Gold Certificates can be Used as Cash for Collateral and as a Deposit Reserve</h3>
<p>The Central Reserve Bank's gold certificates have been issued in four phases, and the sales volume has been excellent, and it has been highly regarded by the financial circles and merchants. After the first and second phases of gold certificates expired, many holders went to redeem gold, but with the belief that gold certificates are gold, many holders were willing to store the gold certificates and did not want to redeem gold immediately. It is now heard that the Central Reserve Bank is for the convenience of general financial institutions holding gold certificates to regulate their capital operations. For the sake of convenience, gold certificates can be used as cash for collateral, and financial institutions can also use them as a deposit reserve.</p>
<p>Central Reserve Bank Allows</p>
<p>The allocation slips used by banks and money shops in this city for the Central Reserve Bank and the Silver Union Association to prepare for collection have been scheduled to be discontinued on July 30th. The major member banks and money shops in the silver and money industries are actively discussing the cash head amount required daily at that time, and are requesting the Central Reserve Bank. According to sources in the financial community: The financial authorities stopped the exercise of allocation slips in order to prevent credit expansion, and changed to using parallel horizontal line checks. In addition to absolutely cautious development, the cash prepared cannot but be planned in advance. After the silver and money industries have verbally requested the Central Reserve Bank, they will also choose one of the calm days of the 19th of this month, and the various banks and money shops will carefully list the "current account deposit number table" of the day according to the table, which is divided into: Current deposit, Current account deposit, Special current deposit, etc., deposit and payment amount. In addition, a separate table of employee expenses and meals is attached, which is compiled separately by the Silver and Money Industry Association and submitted to the Central Reserve Bank to request an increase in the daily amount of certificate (cash) collection. The approximate amount of the money industry is about 40,000 yuan per day, and the banking industry is about 100,000 yuan or more per day, which has been allowed. The only thing to consider is the increase or decrease in the amount. It is expected that the request will be successfully resolved before the end of this month.</p>
<h3>Economic Bureau Bans Illegal Sales of Coal Briquettes</h3>
<p>After the cessation of coal briquette rationing to households in this city, the citizens' needs have relied entirely on the black market, and prices have risen with various major daily necessities, and the quality of all of them is generally below the standard. Recently, it was reported that the Da Zhonghua Coal Briquette Factory at No. 1329 Lujiabang Road in Nanshi announced the distribution and sale of special coal briquettes to the city. We went to consult the economic authorities, and we were told that due to the lack of raw materials, there is no fixed date for the next round of household coal briquette rationing. As for the Da Zhonghua Coal Briquette Factory's unauthorized use of announcements to promote its products and purchase them with residence permits, it is indeed inappropriate.</p>
<p>Moreover, Da Zhonghua is a businessman and speaks lightly about rationing, which is extremely rebellious. The bureau has already strictly banned it.</p>
<h3>Sugar Industry Joint Venture to be Established at the Beginning of Next Month</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Sugar Industry Joint Venture, which is being prepared by the Shanghai District Sugar Industry Association, has now exceeded the original quota after handling member registration applications. It is learned that the association is scheduled to be formally established at the beginning of next month. The main tasks of the association's operations are: The handling of sugar rationed to households in the city. The procurement and distribution of sugar. Other matters related to sugar and management.</p>

Xu Jimu's "Collection of Economic Essays", remuneration of 300,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Resolutions of County Meetings Should be Submitted for Approval on a Case-by-Case Basis</h3>
<p>The municipal government believes that the various counties and districts in the city hold various meetings, often only sending meeting minutes, which are submitted in general terms. It is difficult to verify the content of each resolution, the steps, and whether there are any other obstacles in implementation. In order to conduct serious supervision, at the administrative meeting of the counties and districts convened by the County Administration Office this time, the competent department proposed that the resolutions of various meetings of the counties and districts should be submitted for approval on a case-by-case basis. The resolution was passed and has been submitted to the government by the County Administration Office for the subordinate departments to follow.</p>
<h3>Dinghai Shenjiamen Line Ship Service</h3>
<p>Since the China Shipping Company resumed shipping on various lines this month, it has not only facilitated travel, but also greatly improved the smooth transportation of materials from various places, with even greater results. It is learned that the company, in view of the fact that the eastern Zhejiang coast, such as Dinghai and Shenjiamen, is a marine product area. Therefore, the company has designated it as a route range, and has now started scheduled services. There is one round trip per week, which not only transports materialism, but also carries passengers.</p>
<h3>Jiaotong Bank Reviews Agricultural Loans</h3>
<p>Since the Jiaotong Bank was ordered to hold rural loans to regulate the rural economy and enhance production, although the total amount of loan funds has been limited, it has failed to expand the scope of agricultural loans, but the original funds that have been loaned to agricultural areas have achieved the effect of promoting increased agricultural production. Up to now, the number of agricultural economic loan enterprises and production increase loans in Shanghai, Jiaxing, Suzhou, Wuxi, Dongtai and other regions is quite large. It is heard that the bank has increased the number of enterprises and production increase loan customers handled by the agricultural offices. At that time, the investigations, supervision and release were all carried out by personnel sent to various regions. It is feared that there may be negligence. The agricultural loan offices should personally handle the review, and the enterprise loans should be thoroughly checked household by household, and the production increase loans should be checked in batches and household by household. At the same time, for overdue loans, personnel should be sent to urge collection as soon as possible, and it should not be allowed to be overdue.</p>
<h3>Brief News</h3>

<h3>Overview of the Recent Work of the Municipal Evacuation Committee</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Municipal Population Evacuation Committee has spared no effort in organizing evacuation agencies, preparing transportation, and investigating evacuation destinations. It is now focusing on the mandatory evacuation of charitable organizations. The following is the situation of some of the work of the committee stationed in the Shenbao News Agency:</p>
<p>Various Institutions Established One After Another</p>
<p>Since the Investigation and Design Group and the Liaison Group of the committee began working at the Shenbao News Agency in early March, it has been three months. Due to the needs of the affairs, the Aviation and Land Committees were established one after another to specialize in renting transportation. Wang Shuxian was appointed as the director of the Aviation Committee. Jing Zhai was appointed as the director of the Land Committee. Later, because Director Wang Shuxian had other duties and could not take care of the Aviation Committee, Director Huang also took charge of its affairs. A question office was also set up to answer any questions that citizens may have about the evacuation organization. Later, as the contacts from all parties had already made some progress, and the evacuation work was about to be implemented, a bus station was established at No. 723 Xianyang Road, and a temporary wharf and office were established at the Central Market on Xizang Road and North Suzhou Road. At the same time, the evacuation destination must also be determined. After the results of the inspection and investigation by the personnel, it was unanimously recognized that Dongting Xishan in Suzhou had not suffered any losses after the war and could be an ideal evacuation destination. In order to make the liaison with the Jiangsu Provincial Government smooth, the committee's Suzhou office was established, and the Dongting Xishan branch office was established.</p>
<p>Summary of Work on the Aviation Route</p>
<p>In terms of evacuating the population by air route, with the enthusiastic assistance of the Allied Navy authorities, they agreed to facilitate the special ships evacuating the population along the route. Subsequently, the borrowing of ships was carried out. With the cooperation of our Kirk Association, the association currently has pig transport ships from northern Jiangsu and sailing ships coming to Shanghai. Usually, there are about 20 or 30 ships every day, and they do not carry goods on the return journey, which can be used for population evacuation. After inspection by the association, it was considered inappropriate to transport people in pig ships, so the association continued to negotiate with the Inland River Shipping Company, and planned to attach civilian ships to each scheduled ship on the association's existing routes. The company expressed great support for the evacuation work. Each scheduled ship was attached with a civilian ship, and each passenger paid 3,330 yuan (including ship rental, tugboat, fuel, labor, and various miscellaneous expenses along the way). The evacuation is currently being carried out one after another. Any citizens who want to evacuate to Suzhou can go to the branch offices of the executive group of the association (previously reported, such as the Baojia Office on the sixth floor of the building) to register.</p>
<p>Summary of Work on Land Route</p>
<p>After the establishment of the Land Committee, a bus terminal was first established so that vehicles could be concentrated as soon as they were available. With the assistance of the Municipal Construction Bureau, the bus station was approved to borrow a portion of the square at No. 723 Xianyang Road for parking. On the one hand, it was planned to borrow the red buses of the French Public Bus Company that were not in use as evacuation transportation, but the plan was suspended because the vehicles had other uses. Subsequently, the municipal government was requested to order the Construction Bureau to requisition vehicles from the Municipal Automobile Transportation Industry Association. In consideration of the difficulties of the merchants, it was still planned to compensate the merchants for the consumption of vehicles within the possible range so as not to cause damage. The requisition of vehicles is now being negotiated with the Construction Bureau. The rental of long-distance trucks is also being arranged. On June 5, a meeting was held with the various truck companies, and it was learned that except for a small number of cars that were not suitable for evacuation, the number that could be rented by the association was not large. According to the investigation, the total number of vehicles traveling to Wuxi, Changshu, and Songjiang is only 40 or 50. After negotiation, the car dealers agreed to transfer five trucks each week to assist, and all expenses and consumption would be borne by the car dealers. The evacuation was decided to be carried out according to this method, and a light test was conducted on the Suzhou, Changshu, Kunshan, Qingpu, and Songjiang lines. Depending on the actual possibilities, the route will be gradually expanded. We are now waiting for the citizens to register with the executive group for evacuation, and we will drive as soon as they are gathered. In addition, for the evacuation of the people from various places in North China back to their hometowns, we have negotiated with the Huazhong Railway Company to attach special evacuation cars to facilitate evacuation, which will be realized soon.</p>

<h3>Home Tutor Training Completed, Letters from All Walks of Life Urge Employment</h3>
<p>Our Association Formulates Employment Rules</p>
<p>The "Home Tutor Training Class" sponsored by the Volunteer Education Association of this newspaper. Recently, educational experts have been giving lectures and speeches, and the research atmosphere is very strong. The main courses such as the cooperation methods between home tutors and parents' schools, individual teaching methods, main course tutoring methods, how to guide children to prepare for exams, etc., are all newly designed subjects for home tutors. The training will be completed soon, and our association will introduce them as much as possible to serve as summer home tutors. In the past three or four days, there have been several letters from all walks of life asking to hire teachers. Our association will carefully select them to meet your expectations. It is hoped that the gentlemen who write letters will clearly state the conditions, such as address and telephone number, number of students, level and tutoring subjects, tutoring time and the number of salaries sent, and whether lodging can be provided? Please fill in the above items clearly. Our association can get a lot of convenience in the recommendation. According to the current situation, the children of wealthy families often fail in their studies and do not make progress. Summer tutoring is really necessary. Time flies like an arrow, so please hire them as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Saving Laundry Fees to Help Charity School Funds</h3>
<p>A letter from Mr. Yu Sanhua said: "I am writing this letter to inform you that I have often felt the pain of dropping out of school in my early years. Therefore, I have saved the laundry fees and raised 5,000 yuan, which I have sent to help the 'Charity School Fund'. The amount is not enough to help those who have dropped out of school, but it is just a small effort. I hope that the honest merchants on the sea will generously contribute to charity and help education, which is my deepest wish."</p>
