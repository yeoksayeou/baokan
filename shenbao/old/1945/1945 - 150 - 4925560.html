<h3>日豐田副武大將繼任軍令部總長　小澤中將任海軍總司令長官</h3>
<p>東京十二九日中央社電　日本及川軍令部總長，此次榮轉軍事　參議官，其後任巳決由海軍總司令長官·兼職合艦司令長官·海上護衛司令長官豐田副武大將繼任。豐田長官之後任，由軍令部次長小澤治三郎中將就任。又新軍令部次長由大西瀧治郎中將就任。日海軍省二十九日就此發表如次：海軍大將及川古志郎任軍事參議官，海軍大將豐田副武任軍令部總長，海軍中將小澤治三郎任海軍總司令長官兼聯合艦隊司令長官，兼海上司令長官，海軍中將大西國瀧次郎任軍令部次長。</p>
<p>東京二十九日中央社電　日海軍總司令長官兼聯合艦隊司司令長官豐田副武大將，長期於海上活躍，此次就任軍令部總長，以其前綫貴重之經騐，活用於軍令方面，對本土決戰戰局，定將有極大貢獻。新海軍總司令長官小澤治三郎中將，新軍令部次長大西瀧治郎中將，皆為航空關係權威者，尤以大西中將曾充菲島方面海軍航空部隊指揮官，於台灣海百菲島海面海空戰樹立偉勳。今日航空決戰愈趨激烈，以通猛富於前綫經騐及航空戰之權威就此要職，極為至當，且由是可知海軍欲突破難局之決意，其活躍頗堪期待。</p>
<p>東京二十九日中央社電　小澤總司令官，宮崎縣人，明治四十二年海軍學校卒業，昭和十一年十二月任少將，十二年二月任聯合艦隊參議長，是年十一月任職官，十三年十一月任海軍水雷學校校長，其後任戰隊司令官，十五年十一月任中將，十六年九月任海軍大學校長，十七年一月任司令長官　前綫，十九年十一月任軍令部次長以迄於今。</p>
<h3>冲繩島周邊海域繼續猛襲敵艦船　日特攻隊收獲重大戰果</h3>
<p>東京二十九日中央社電　那　及首里一帶之激戰塲，自二十六日夜半起沛然豪　，安謝用河水汜濫，附近一帶化成泥濘，雙方之行動均被拘束。但日軍守備部隊利用此種不便，痛烈反復攻擊，使敵苦惱異常，因日軍勇戰敢鬥，敵之死傷日有增加，據敵方發表稱，死傷者已突破三萬五千名，因此軻知敵軍之犧牲極為重大。二十四日夜間冲繩本島北中國飛機塲强行降陸成功之義烈空挺部隊，於敵陣中繼續作外死戰，二十七日傍晚，據日空軍偵察之結果，北飛機塲因日降下將兵之敢鬥，其機能依然停止，不能使用，中機塲因降下將兵之奮戰，使用亦不可能。一方日軍特攻隊之航空作戰，亦乘此良機，繼續於本島周邊海域迭次收獲戰果。緣日軍特攻隊有力之一羣，於二十七日上午八時四十四分至九時之間，不顧氣候不良，向於中城灣游弋中之敵艦船羣實行突擊，至現在所查明獲得之戰果，計擊沉艦種不詳者一艘。擊毀一艘，其他特攻隊收獲之戰果極為重大。又繼續下午之攻擊，自下午五時四十五分之間，同樣以有力之特別攻擊隊，將中城灣之艦船羣實施攻擊，，此次戰果則尙未查明。冲繩周邊之氣候，二十八日已回復晴朗，晨起日特攻隊為搜索敵踪，大舉出動猛烈之强襲，攻擊正在進行中。</p>
<h3>西南太平洋日軍戰果</h3>
<p>南方基地二十九日中央社電　瑞地海軍當局於二十七日發表，　對來駿西南太平洋方面之敵機及潛水艇，經海軍部隊自本年一月一日至五月廿三日止所獲戰果大體如次：擊沉潛水艇十六艘，又大至已吿擊沉者二艘，擊毀三艘，共計二十一艘。擊落飛機七十九架，又大致已吿擊落者四十四架，擊毀一百九十二架共計三百十五架。　日軍部隊於本年五月一日至二十三日，對來犯泰拉干敵軍之戰果如次：擊沉掃海艇五艘，殲滅敵兵二千一百五十三名。</p>
<h3>特別攻擊隊　科學與力的結晶</h3>
<p>白色的霧從山的那方渡過了溪谷樹林，流向飛機塲。未幾，月亮亦跚跚來遲地昇了起來。月光給霧包住，戰鬥避開令所的前面，意外地暗澹。完成了任務的傳令兵，手裏拿地　燭火也熄了，但特攻隊的勇士却站在黑暗的夜霧中。走近去一看，原來部隊長正在講解「突入時的角度」，「途中的高度」，「對付格拉曼的措置」。這是他們被選為振武特攻隊員以來日夜硏究的事情。這時，在朦朧的月光下，每個隊員的眼都閃閃射出眞誠的光芒。自從黃昏時分着陸這個基地以後，立即站着聽訓，有些隊員連晚餐都未進呢。不過，到了此地來，誰都平心靜慮，專心於任務的完成。他們集中了全副精神，忘去了對於深恐不能完成任務的憂慮，以及各地由裏的熱烈歡送情况。</p>
<h3>特攻精神遠離死生</h3>
<p>在這距離冲繩咫尺的前綫基地，接到「明日拂曉〇時出擊，目標是冲繩本島東方的敵艦船」這個最後的命令時，從悠久的大義產生出來的深邃的特攻精神，早使隊員的心遠遠丟開了生死問題。此時，佔據了特攻隊員全心靈的，祗是「如何粉碎敵艦？」「如何排除敵軍火綱？」航行法如何？「操縱法如何？」</p>
<p>「最後，還有一點要注意，就是直到突入的瞬間，不論發生了什麼事，都不可眨眼。如果先有人突入而開了一個洞，自巴也要張大眼睛，直向那個洞衝去。」</p>
<p>並肩立於人垣最外側的，是第〇〇振武隊的鈴木（原籍福島），木村（原籍山口），寺尾（原籍兵庫）三伍長，他們都是昭和年間生的，而且全少年飛行兵出身。</p>
<p>「現在中，離開出擊的時候巳不到幾個鐘頭了。大家都回到宿舍裏去，安心睡一回兒，那怕是一小時兩小時，也是好的。」部隊長說完了話。</p>
<p>前三天以來，以特別攻擊隊為中心，日軍展開了「靑葉攻勢」，一次又一次，隔開若干時間，不分淸晨，白晝或黑夜，簡直不休不息地出擊，所以基地的空氣緊張到極點。敵軍的戰意即使旺盛，敵軍的物弱，要迎頭趕上去。</p>
<h3>必殺必中的獨特戰法</h3>
<p>「完全是神兵的樣子，　偉大！」</p>
<p>夜霧濡濕了肩章，看大家迅即消失有黑暗中以後，部隊長也獨個兒喃喃地走向戰鬥司令所，屋隅安放和士兵所用一樣的牀，是供出發以前假寐片刻之用的。</p>
<p>「在菲律賓方面決定先派特別攻擊隊時，我也在那邊。那時，軍方用「必殺必中之戰法」這句話來表現。軍人在實踐任何作戰任，本業不期生還。不過，最初起就超越生死觀念而出擊，這種壯烈的特攻戰法，祗有流日本人血液內的那種神聖心意才能實行，才可理解。而從雷伊泰到冲，這種「必殺必中」的戰法已在戰局的全面顯現其眞正價値了。」說到這裏，部隊長的語詞突然改變。</p>
<h3>振武隊員的心情</h3>
<p>「我的鄕里就在那座山的對方，昨日去探省老母。歸家後，家裏拿出配給酒和一瓶不知何處弄來的啤酒，並且殺了一隻雞。開戰以來，隨航空部隊戰馬來·緬甸·所羅門·新幾內亞·菲律賓的我，現在竟退到這個故鄕的國內基地來，和老母一同戰爭……想來來，眞正感慨無量！因為在威瓦克等地時，決心一死報國，巳不知有幾次了。……力，一切都是力！在本土的南端布下背水之陣，而屹然不動的，就是這個力！與敵美展開多次航空戰，而一直扭打到冲繩的，也是這個力。以前的九個力，無論怎樣，總不及第十個力。眞所謂差之毫厘，失之千里，凡事都在一點上顯出不同。我們現在必須要有勇氣直視這個嚴冷的力的絕對。想依靠什麼力外之力在最後的瞬間拯救我們，這就是卑怯，未成熟，妥協！現在決沒有這樣便宜的事！振武隊的年輕人，在行將出擊的今夜，心中祗有飛機和炸彈，恐所他們時在夢中也祗網孔冰機和炸彈吧。到了這種塲合，就是同胞手足也都給忘掉了。」</p>
<p>部長一屁股坐在牀上，握拳拍着膝部。</p>
<h3>科學心與力的整備</h3>
<p>「量是要緊的力的要素。在說到九個力，十個力的時候，當然不是祗以量為問題的。更要緊的是組織此力的科學之辦。特別攻擊表示日本人精神無比的堅强，但是若不集日本科學之粹而使之爆發，那就不行。無論是飛機，是炸彈，是數量，是速度，都非由日本科學的全力使之結晶不可。今日，在冲繩天授的地理優勢下，這個機會不可錯過，日本人振起一般的科學心，以絕對的力迅速整備打倒敵人的勢態。「必殺必中」的特攻戰法，生恨於全體的力的基盤中時，才能發揮其眞謗。」</p>
<p>月亮昇到窗口，不知那裏已有雞在啼了。出擊的時間快到。（宮本報道班員）（譯自五月八日讀賣報知）</p>
<p>日神雷特攻隊威辦震撼敵陣　海軍省特表彰其功勳</p>
<p>東京二十九日中央社電　日海軍省二十八日公布：聯合艦隊司令官嘉許神雷特別攻擊隊，曾自昭和二十年三月下旬以來，屢次出擊於日本本土南方及冲繩周邊海上，且以其壯烈之戰意與一彈必沉之威力，震憾敵陣，特此佈吿全軍，以彰其功勳。</p>
<p>東京二十九日中央社電　日神雷機隊乃為航空特攻隊之最高峯者，其旺盛之戰意與可怖之威力，猛烈於敵頭上炸烈時之情形，猶如霹靂之下，襲烈之極。按過去之特攻機，為轟炸機或戰鬥機，施以特殊爆炸裝置，飛機本身為一炸彈。而神雷機乃所謂母子飛機，特攻隊員乘上如小型飛機而有兩翼之炸彈，由母機拖於胸部，出動至敵艦船上空投下，於是即以猛烈速度俯衝。由是可知日機隊之訓練，不獨着重於航空技術，所有隊員並受航空特攻或神雷特攻之訓練，此等勇土之熾烈戰意與偉大威力將不斷顯於敵軍頭上。</p>
<h3>隊員出征壯烈一幕</h3>
<p>前綫海軍基地二十八日中央社電　日神雷攻擊隊刻在冲繩海域繼續作戰，四月十六日為第五次出陣，以冲繩西方海面之敵艦船羣為攻擊目標，是日拂曉神雷攻擊隊由基地出征，日海陸制空隊亦在奄美大島善界島一帶天空，迎擊敵戰鬥機羣，殺開特攻機之進擊路，轟炸隊神劍·眧和·筑波·七生各隊於奄美大島東方洋而之敵機動部隊連續猛攻，對於冲繩四周之敵艦船羣，由日陸海軍特攻隊大舉予以痛擊。當此航空總攻擊之際，宮下中尉等五名神雷隊，搭乘澤井中尉指揮之攻擊機出擊，宮下與澤井兩尉於訓練期間，曾屢次合作另，此次則適同乘一機由基地進發，迨至某分巳距決戰之前綫不遠，兩人之呼吸頓吿緊張。七時以手支頰，坐於指揮官席之宮玷尉即由澤井尉促之曰，「時機至矣，曷乘乎」，宮下中尉答曰是，當即起身乘入神雷器，突然前方瞭見白浪，敵艦巳發現矣。電信員向基地拍送發見攻擊目標之電信，敵勢力為戰艦一艘艦型不詳者二艘，旋又拍出第二報曰，神雷已向敵艦進攻矣。以下為完畢攻擊任務後之澤井中尉之報吿稱，敵艦船刻向我方前進，我特攻機隊　凖此絕好時機，發出神雷後即行退避，轉瞬間已發覺攻擊成功，予喜極，叩操縱員之肩曰「妙哉」，敵方似發射兩三彈，但我方目擊此時海面濃烟籠罩，踰時巳不見何物矣，此種凄烈緊張之一剎那，直似百雷齊發，聲震海空</p>
<h3>美雜誌描述日軍新兵器</h3>
<p>瑞典京城廿九日中央社電　美國「時代雜誌」關於初次出現於冲繩戰塲之日軍新兵器報道如次：日軍用奇妙之小型飛機，已出現於太平洋，該項飛機，亦即駕駛員必須與飛機同歸於盡之自殺機。初次出現於冲繩戰塲之此兵器，全重二噸，由木材機射出，先由母機將其運至一千公尺之上空，突然射下，飛機頭部係一大炸彈，翼長十六英尺，機身二十英尺，續航空距離三十五哩至四十哩，時速四百哩至七百哩，尾部裝有舵一對。</p>
<h3>歐英美軍限制調往太平洋</h3>
<p>里斯本二十九日中央社電　據息：歐洲聯合國軍總司令部宣佈，凡曾於歐洲戰塲作戰，而確曾於西里·科西嘉·撒丁諸島·或義大利各島參加戰役者，除自願參加外，不得調往太平洋作戰，但此僅以士兵為限，軍官則不在內。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>冲繩戰局與日本精神</h3>
<p>冲繩島戰局，仍在熾烈行中，據合衆社戰地記者發表，「最近一月以來，美軍在冲繩之作戰，遭受理想上之困難，在前綫僅進三哩。過去樂觀者認為美軍即可攻佔首里及進佔那　，但至今那　未佔，首里仍在外圍。」從此可知冲繩戰役的熾烈，敵美企圖之未易實現與所受打擊之嚴重。</p>
<p>其次，盟軍特攻大編隊，旣不斷對敵作立體攻擊，破壞敵方　種設備。復於本月二十四日月夜，由陸軍大尉奧出道郎指揮之「義烈空挺隊」，對冲繩本島北·中兩機塲突然降陸，立即炸燬地上敵機及軍需倉庫，機塲設施等，使敵　於混亂狀態。同時，為策應空挺隊之突擊，其他特攻隊對冲繩周圍之敵艦船，民開猛攻。陸上守海隊亦戰意激昂，奮身挺進。因此，敵將尼米資司令部公報，也不得不承認日軍海陸呼應，攻擊勇猛，而此次特攻隊之攻擊，尤為戰爭開始以來最强烈者。</p>
<p>敵美機動部隊出現於九州海面以來，已經兩個月以上，在這兩個月中間，歐洲戰局的急轉直下，而國際政治的浪潮更不下於戰局之激熨，但是，東亞戰局，却因冲繩島盟軍的神妙勇戰，未受影響。且將最近幾個月來敵方不斷策動的謀略攻勢，以及速戰速決的陰謀戰略，加以粉碎。</p>
<p>冲繩戰役盟軍的英勇作戰，業已爭取充分的時間，預先造成防衛日本本上的有利條件。因此，這種戰果，決不單是擊沉和擊毀敵方艦隊等物質的戰果，這種成功，隊季盟軍最高作戰當局的指揮卓越，以及特攻勇士的奮不顧身之外，更不能不特別歸功於日本精神。</p>
<p>其實，日本精神並無如何的神秘性，看作日本精神有如何的「神秘」性者，只有物質至上主義的敵美當局，由於驚奇恐慌而發生的。實際上，日本精神正是日本人民敬愛自己祖國，敬愛大東亞民族，為爭取大東亞的解放自由，便油然而興犧牲一巴以保衛羣衆的理念，於是有「一機一艦」，「一死百殺」的義烈行為，使敵方驚奇而認為「神秘」。而在我們東方民族，這正是「殺身成仁」，「捨身取義」的人類最高精神的表現。親身參加的日本大學生及專科學生。因此，決無敵人所認為「神秘」性，而是科學與精神力的結晶。</p>
<p>誠如松本大尉所說：「我們滅敵人就是用我們超越生死的慷慨的氣魄，與堅決的信念，這是東鄕元帥的精神，也是日本固有的武士道的精神。……現在敵人雖以物量與我們的精精力求的均衡，然而物量無論如何是有限的，而我們的精神是無限的。」這種日本精神，巳經在冲繩島戰役中充分表現。在此緊急的決戰階級，惟有更高度發揮這種精神力量，才能爭取勝利，我們站在同一戰綫，我們全民—尤其是一般大學生，將怎樣的發揮東方民族精神，實在値得深切反省的。</p>
<p>敵機襲橫濱市墜毀七十架　一部侵襲川崎東京</p>
<p>東京二十九日中央社電　日大本營二十九日下午五時發表：　二十九日午前九時三十九起，約歷一小時半，敵B29型機約五百架，並有P51型機約百架，以主力對橫濱市來襲，其一部侵襲川崎市及東京，向市街地區投擲燒夷彈，濫施轟炸，因此橫濱市蒙有相當損害。　日制空部隊所獲戰果中，現經查明者計擊落三十架，擊毀約四十架。</p>
<p>東京二十九日中央社電　敵B29型機約五百架，輔以P51型機百架，於二十九日上午八時三十分左右約歷一小時半，逐次侵入橫濱地區，從高度五千米天空，投下燒夷彈，濫炸市待地區。又另一部來襲川崎及東京，投下燒夷彈。按馬里亞納基地之「羅茂轟炸隊」，曾於二址四日拂曉及二十五日夜迄二十六日拂曉，各以約二百五十架再度對東京施行間大規模轟炸，為時僅隔一日，今又第三次以約五百架之大量機數來襲，可見馬里亞納基地敵空軍勢力，最近有飛躍增强，以此擴充之航空兵力，企圖迅速達成攪亂日方之生產陣容，足見敵之戰意極其兇猛。又硫黃島基地之P51型機以百架大編隊，協同B29型機來襲作戰，以此為第一次，今後敵轟炸日本土作戰之動向，極堪注目。</p>
<h3>襲關門敵機全部受創</h3>
<p>東京二十九日中央社電　南方基地敵B29型機十二架，於二十八日拂曉來襲博多灣及關門地區，投下機雷，企圖切斷日方航行綫，日制空部隊猛烈迎戰，擊落其四架擊毀八架，重創全部來襲之敵機，受創之八架圖向豐後水道方面遁去，但欲返還南方基地似巳絕望。</p>
<h3>渝美士兵時起衝突</h3>
<p>中央社訊　據靈通方面消息：五月十七日重慶時事新報社論稱，由於戰局之轉變，中國領土漸次成為作戰上重要塲所，因此美國軍隊之進駐中國者亦有日形增多之趨勢，同時重慶和美國士兵問，過去時有不愉快之衝突事件發生，而今益形增加，此實為不勝遺憾者，希望渝美兩當局設法預防此種衝突案件之再發生云云。又據五月二十七日重慶塔斯社電云，重慶為慰勞英美雙方兵士起見，不久將在該地設立國際俱樂部之計劃，同時幷報稱，美憲兵約五十名已入駐重慶，對美士兵之行動從事秘密盬視，該項措置已為重慶市民所週知之事實。重慶與美國士兵間之衝突及感情上之不一致，遠在一年以前早有人傳出。又傳重慶昆明等地為慰勞美士兵起見，更設有特別招待所，以妙齡女郎充招待員，但美士兵之暴行案件，反而漸漸增加，即以昆明一地而言，月有二十餘件之多，當地輿論界過去均抱緘默態度，但目前各報社均極注意此種糾紛，而於消息評論中可時見之，蓋事實彰彰亦無法矇蔽矣。</p>

<p>宜興在泰代稱為陽羨，至晋屬宜興郡，隨改陽羨縣為義興縣，恧各於常州府。至宋太宗時，因避諱改義興為宜興縣。淸時分為宜興荆溪兩縣，民國合併為宜興一縣。</p>
<p>宜興位於太湖西岸，南界浙屬長興，西南接皖屬廣德，西界溧陽，西北臨洮湖，北為金壇　湖及武進，面積一百六七十方時在。</p>
<h3>山川地勢</h3>
<p>西南多山，餘均平疇沃野。西南部崇嵐疊嶂，及溪山如畫，遇有兵事，輒為出入重隘。如甲子齊魯之戰，以及此次事變，張渚·湖文·丁蜀二山均駐有重兵，而襄王嶺·茗嶺·縣脚嶺。啄木嶺等處為攻防要地。山脈來自浙皖，即南嶺之支脈。水則東有太胡，西北有　湖·洮湖·荆溪橫濱貫東西。運河北通武進無錫。其間港汶縱橫，密如蛛綱，舟楫至便。洮　二湖及西南諸山水，山西　下流，東氿分流於百　，以達太湖而入江歸海。</p>
<h3>物產</h3>
<p>本邑物產豐富，以米麥為生。蔬屬蘿葡·芋頭·百合·山芋·竹筍及其他瓜蔬，以太湖濱及賣上為尤多。菓品有栗·梨·桃·柿子·石榴·銀杏等。山產主要品，有毛竹·水竹·剛竹，平時遠銷魯省。木材以松杉為最多，轉運不便，往往鋸板出售。山中又多　·兎·野猪·野山羊等，野獸虎豹等，問有出沒。湖濱則魚蝦之類甚富。此外，茶葉·木炭·石炭·石材·絲　·紙張等產量亦不少。惟近以運輸困難，捐稅重重，山中尤為軍事禁地，以致生產減低，而山民凋敝。</p>
<h3>交通</h3>
<p>宜城為京杭國道中心，為宜常車路之起點。現宜常車路尙稱完好，逐日有汽車來往。水路則與武進無錫有汽船可通。惟以時局關係，往往不能按期行駛。境內信船，則或有或無，時生問題。</p>
<h3>行政及治安</h3>
<p>最高行政機關為縣政府，設在前宜興縣立女子中學舊址。全縣仍分八區，各區設區長，以下為鄕鎭保甲制。新四軍轄下，則分宜興東北為武宜縣，西南為宜溧縣，區制亦多所更改，縣府則流動不定，鄕保長大都模稜兩可。治安問題，邊防要地大都為友軍及和平軍駐紥，腥地則為縣保安隊駐守，常調防流動。此外，則於宜城設魯察總局，仍就城隍廟原址為局所。和橋·高　·官村·徐舍·張渚·周鐵橋·丁山·宋　設有分駐所，蜀山·紅塔頭·范道舍·邑亭橋則設派出所，以維持地方治安。</p>
<h3>敎育</h3>
<p>中小敎育，量多而質欠佳。高初中合校者有城內宜興中學，蜀山宜興中學，三區賦村中學，弘毅中學，二區夏芳中學，八區胥井有三洲職業中學，和橋西生中學，徐舍蘇南中學。單設初嘀咕者有張渚中學，鯨塘中學，堰頭橋中學，芳橋中學，周鐵橋竺西中學，棠下崇德中學，和橋彭城中學。專六學校則漕橋附近分水墩有蘇州美專。小學則到處均是。但以師資缺乏，濫芋充數者，比比皆是，敎育經費，小學或有地方公款補助，中學大都自給自足，量入為出。學生納費及敎職員薪給，均以實物——米計算，小學　平均學米每學期為五斗，中學則為九斗。敎職員月米，小學平均為一石五斗，中學則為三石左右，但須視收入為凖。</p>
<h3>市區情形</h3>
<p>宜興全邑人口，在事變前為五十八萬，事變之第和，尙無正確統計。農田原為一百六萬七千餘畝，自土地查報後為一百四十六萬餘畝。縣城周圍九里，介乎東西兩氿之間中，事變燬滅五分之三，半燬於飛機炸彈，半燬於盜刦。現正努力復興，以較橋為中心，向四方分築車路。惟向西一段，以地形過低，尙未施工。除原有城門西門及北甲子門閉塞外，餘均通行無阻。而新開北門，直對較橋，氣象雄偉。市面則南大街較為繁榮。離宜城北三十里之和橋鎭，為本邑經濟中心，調節機關有榮和，永隆，興業等錢莊，可以通匯。東南丁山蜀山兩鎭，為陶器之出產地，畸形熟鬧。西南張渚，徐舍，楊巷及北面之和橋，市房一度燬捐，現大部已重行砌過。</p>
<h3>民生及物價</h3>
<p>本邑原為魚米之鄕，生活舒適，祇以事變以來，捐稅重重，稻捐，米捐，麥捐，柴草捐，山貨捐，無往而不捐，無行而不稅，以致民不聊生。地方公正人士多避嫌遠引，或閉門高蹈，奸　之徒，則橫行不法，此種社會隱憂，亟盼當局嚴密注意。物價五月份中旬白米每石七萬五千元，靑麥每石一萬五千元，黃豆每石八萬元，猪肉每斤一千元，豆油每斤一千八百元，鹽每斤六百元，山柴每担二千元。</p>
<p>總之，宜興為蘇省邊區，社會情形極複雜。軍隊之出入者，有友軍，和軍平，新四軍，地方保安隊以及其他雜色部隊，不一而足。大部給養，除少數部隊外，均向商人農民捐稅，故人民珠苦不勝負担也。</p>

<h3>對民食物價當局商定辦法　陳實長來滬公畢返京</h3>
<p>邇來本市物價漲風甚厲，尤以主要商品漲勢最烈，其中因受囤積商人之操縱居奇，為最大癥結。影響民生治安至鉅。實業部長陳君　為此，特於日前來滬，向有關各當局詢物價高漲實際情形，謀取平物價措置，對於投機商人之囤積居奇，决以最嚴峻手段取締懲罰。關於民食之供給，亦商有辦法，不久當可解决一切困難問題。聞陳部長以在滬任務巳暫吿一段落，已於昨日由滬返京。</p>
<h3>借用支票行莊概不支付　銀錢業聯會决定</h3>
<p>本市銀行業同業公會，頃據會員函稱：各銀行對於活存或往來開戶時，均編列帳號，並刻於領用支票上，以便稽核檢查，且含有保障存戶之意。但乙如持甲之帳號支票兌付時，即刻可以發覺，加以迫詰，惟對帳號一項，於票據法上，並無根據，故非支票要件，然於實務上，則非毫無價値。</p>
<p>三項疑義</p>
<p>茲有數則頗滋欵義：　甲乙均在同一銀行開立帳戶，某日甲適未携帶支票簿，逕取乙所有支票親蓋印鑑，在甲自開之戶內取款，印鑑相符，帳號及支票號碼不符，銀行能否付款？　設甲在借用之支票上，將帳號塗去，改寫甲之帳號，塗改處改甲之印鑑，另出甲仍在簽章處蓋用印鑑，此項支票銀行能否照付？　設塗改處改用乙印鑑，由甲在簽章處蓋用甲之印鑑，此項支票銀行能否照付？上列三則，同業均將發生欵問，請查照提會討論。當經該公會轉函銀行學會硏究。</p>
<p>易滋流弊</p>
<p>嗣據銀行學會復稱，此事經詳加硏究，認為支票上號數帳號，誠為便利稽核檢查，並有保嶂存戶之意，倘任存戶輾轉借用，極易發生流弊，就上述情形，萬一非由某甲借用某一之支票，而係某乙竊用某甲之圖章者，銀行憑以付某甲之戶，難免不生糾葛。換言之，倘如此即可付款，則僅竊得他人印鑑者，便可　　領款項之目的。為保護存款人利益，及免除銀行責任起見，自以不許借用他人支票為宜。對於用支票，不論上述任何情形，自均未便支付，此種情形最好能使各行統一辦理。嗣經該公會提付銀業聯席會議，認為銀錢業遠門尖採用以示一致，並即分別通吿各行莊遵辦。聞錢業同業，對於借用他人支票，向係否認，故亦通吿各莊備作參考。</p>

<h3>General Toyoda Soemu Appointed Chief of the Naval General Staff; Vice-Admiral Ozawa Appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Navy</h3>
<p>Tokyo, December 9th, Central News Agency: Admiral Osami Nagano, Chief of the Naval General Staff, has been honorably transferred to the position of Military Councilor. His successor has been decided as Admiral Soemu Toyoda, Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, concurrently Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet and Commander-in-Chief of the Maritime Escort Fleet. Vice-Admiral Jisaburo Ozawa, Vice Chief of the Naval General Staff, will succeed Admiral Toyoda. Furthermore, Vice-Admiral Takijiro Onishi has been appointed as the new Vice Chief of the Naval General Staff. The Navy Ministry of Japan announced the following on the 29th: Admiral Koshiro Oikawa is appointed Military Councilor, Admiral Soemu Toyoda is appointed Chief of the Naval General Staff, Vice-Admiral Jisaburo Ozawa is appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, concurrently Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet and Commander-in-Chief of the Maritime Escort Fleet, and Vice-Admiral Takijiro Onishi is appointed Vice Chief of the Naval General Staff.</p>
<p>Tokyo, December 29th, Central News Agency: Admiral Soemu Toyoda, Commander-in-Chief of the Navy and concurrently Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, has been active at sea for a long time. His appointment as Chief of the Naval General Staff will utilize his valuable front-line experience in military command, and will greatly contribute to the decisive battle on the homeland. The new Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, Vice-Admiral Jisaburo Ozawa, and the new Vice Chief of the Naval General Staff, Vice-Admiral Takijiro Onishi, are both authorities on aviation. In particular, Vice-Admiral Onishi served as commander of naval air units in the Philippines, and established great achievements in the air battles over the sea near Taiwan and the Philippines. As the decisive air battle becomes increasingly fierce, it is extremely appropriate to appoint those who are familiar with the front lines and authorities on air warfare to these important positions. It also shows the Navy's determination to break through the difficult situation, and their activities are highly anticipated.</p>
<p>Tokyo, December 29th, Central News Agency: Commander-in-Chief Ozawa is from Miyazaki Prefecture. He graduated from the Naval Academy in the 42nd year of Meiji (1909). In December of the 11th year of Showa (1936) he was appointed Rear Admiral. In February of the 12th year of Showa (1937) he was appointed Counselor of the Combined Fleet. In November of the same year, he took office as an official. In November of the 13th year of Showa (1938) he was appointed Principal of the Naval Torpedo School. After that, he served as Squadron Commander. In November of the 15th year of Showa (1940) he was appointed Vice-Admiral. In September of the 16th year of Showa (1941) he was appointed Principal of the Naval War College. In January of the 17th year of Showa (1942) he was appointed Commander-in-Chief on the front lines. In November of the 19th year of Showa (1944) he was appointed Vice Chief of the Naval General Staff and has held that position until now.</p>
<h3>Fierce Attacks Continue on Enemy Ships in the Waters Around Okinawa Island; Japanese Special Attack Forces Achieve Significant Results</h3>
<p>Tokyo, December 29th, Central News Agency: At the fiercely contested battlefields near Naha and Shuri, torrential rain has fallen since midnight on the 26th, and the Ansha River has overflowed, turning the surrounding area into mud, restricting the movements of both sides. However, the Japanese garrison forces are taking advantage of this inconvenience to launch intense and repeated attacks, causing the enemy great distress. Due to the brave and daring fighting of the Japanese army, enemy casualties are increasing daily. According to enemy reports, the number of dead and wounded has exceeded 35,000, which shows that the enemy's sacrifices are extremely heavy. The Giretsu Airborne Unit, which successfully made a forced landing at the northern airfield on Okinawa Island on the night of the 24th, continues to fight fiercely within the enemy lines. According to Japanese air force reconnaissance on the evening of the 27th, the function of the northern airfield remains stopped and unusable due to the daring fighting of the Japanese troops who landed there. The use of the central airfield is also impossible due to the struggles of the landed soldiers. On the other hand, the Japanese army's special attack force is also taking advantage of this good opportunity to continue achieving results in the waters around the island. On the morning of the 27th, between 8:44 and 9:00, a powerful group of Japanese special attack forces, disregarding the bad weather, carried out a surprise attack on enemy ships navigating in Nakagusuku Bay. The results that have been confirmed so far include the sinking of one unidentified type of warship and the destruction of another. The results achieved by other special attack forces are extremely significant. Continuing the attack in the afternoon, starting from 5:45 PM, the same powerful special attack forces attacked the ships in Nakagusuku Bay, and the results of this battle are not yet known. The weather around Okinawa cleared up on the 28th, and at dawn, the Japanese special attack force launched a large-scale operation to search for enemy traces and carry out fierce attacks, which are currently underway.</p>
<h3>War Results of the Japanese Army in the Southwestern Pacific</h3>
<p>Southern Base, December 29th, Central News Agency: The Swedish Naval Authority announced on the 27th that the results achieved by the naval forces against enemy aircraft and submarines coming to the southwestern Pacific area from January 1st to May 23rd of this year are roughly as follows: 16 submarines sunk, another two largely sunk, and three damaged, for a total of 21. 79 aircraft shot down, another 44 largely shot down, and 192 damaged, for a total of 315. From May 1st to 23rd of this year, the Japanese army's results against the enemy army invading Tarakan are as follows: 5 minesweepers sunk, and 2,153 enemy soldiers annihilated.</p>
<h3>Special Attack Force - The Crystallization of Science and Strength</h3>
<p>The white fog crossed the valley forest from the other side of the mountain and flowed towards the airfield. Before long, the moon also arrived late and rose. The moonlight was shrouded in fog, making the area in front of the battle avoidance command unexpectedly dim. The orderly, who had completed his mission, had the candle in his hand extinguished, but the warriors of the special attack force stood in the dark night fog. Upon closer inspection, it turned out that the unit commander was explaining the "angle of entry," "the height along the way," and "measures to deal with Grumman aircraft." These were the things they had been studying day and night since being selected as members of the Shimbu Special Attack Corps. At this time, in the hazy moonlight, the eyes of each member shone with sincerity. After landing at this base at dusk, they immediately stood and listened to instructions, and some members had not even had dinner. However, having arrived here, everyone was calm and focused on completing their mission. They concentrated all their energy, forgetting about the worries of not being able to complete the mission, as well as the enthusiastic farewells from various places.</p>
<h3>The Spirit of Special Attacks is Far Removed from Life and Death</h3>
<p>In this front-line base just a short distance from Okinawa, when the final order was received, "Take off at 0000 hours tomorrow, target is enemy ships east of Okinawa Island," the profound spirit of special attacks, born from the eternal cause, had long caused the members to cast aside the question of life and death. At this time, what occupied the minds of the special attack force members was only "How to crush enemy ships?" "How to eliminate enemy fire nets?" How to navigate? "How to operate?"</p>
<p>"Finally, one more thing to pay attention to is that until the moment of entry, no matter what happens, you must not blink. If someone enters first and opens a hole, you must also open your eyes wide and rush straight into that hole."</p>
<p>Standing side by side on the outermost edge of the crowd were Staff Sergeants Suzuki (from Fukushima), Kimura (from Yamaguchi), and Terao (from Hyogo) of the 00th Shimbu Unit. They were all born in the Showa era and were all former youth flying soldiers.</p>
<p>"Now, the time of departure is less than a few hours away. Everyone, go back to the dormitory and get some sleep, even if it's just for an hour or two, it's good," said the unit commander, finishing his words.</p>
<p>For the past three days, with the special attack force at the center, the Japanese army had launched the "Aoba Offensive," launching attacks again and again, at intervals, regardless of whether it was morning, day, or night, simply without rest. Therefore, the atmosphere at the base was extremely tense. Even if the enemy's fighting spirit was strong, the enemy's material weakness had to be overtaken.</p>
<h3>Unique Tactics of Certain Kill and Certain Hit</h3>
<p>"Completely like divine soldiers, so great!"</p>
<p>The night fog soaked the shoulder boards. After watching everyone quickly disappear into the darkness, the unit commander also walked towards the battle command post alone. A bed, the same as those used by the soldiers, was placed in the corner of the room for a moment of rest before departure.</p>
<p>"When it was decided to first send out the special attack force in the Philippines, I was also there. At that time, the military used the phrase 'tactics of certain kill and certain hit' to express it. Soldiers do not expect to survive in any operation. However, launching an attack from the very beginning, transcending the concept of life and death, this kind of magnificent special attack tactic can only be carried out and understood by the kind of sacred intention flowing in the blood of the Japanese people. And from Leyte to Okinawa, this 'certain kill and certain hit' tactic has shown its true value in all aspects of the war situation," the unit commander said, his words suddenly changing.</p>
<h3>The Feelings of the Shimbu Unit Members</h3>
<p>"My hometown is on the other side of that mountain. Yesterday I went to visit my elderly mother. After returning home, my family brought out the rationed sake and a bottle of beer that they had obtained from somewhere, and also killed a chicken. Since the start of the war, I have been fighting in Burma, the Solomon Islands, New Guinea, and the Philippines with the air force, and now I have retreated to this domestic base in my hometown to fight alongside my mother... Thinking about it, I am truly filled with infinite emotion! Because in Wewak and other places, I had resolved to die to repay the country countless times... Strength, everything is strength! Laying down a last stand on the southern tip of the homeland, and standing firm, that is this strength! Engaging the enemy in multiple air battles, and continuing to fight all the way to Okinawa, is also this strength. No matter what, the first nine strengths are not as good as the tenth strength. It is truly said that a hair's breadth makes a difference of a thousand miles, and everything shows a difference in one point. We must now have the courage to face this severe and absolute strength directly. To think of relying on some strength outside of strength to save us at the last moment, that is cowardice, immaturity, and compromise! There is no such cheap thing now! The young men of the Shimbu Unit, on this night before they are about to take off, have only airplanes and bombs in their hearts, and I fear that they are only dreaming of airplanes and bombs. In this kind of situation, even brothers and sisters are forgotten."</p>
<p>The commander sat down heavily on the bed, slapping his knee with his fist.</p>
<h3>Scientific Spirit and Forceful Preparation</h3>
<p>"Quantity is an important element of strength. When speaking of nine strengths or ten strengths, it is of course not just a matter of quantity. More important is the scientific way of organizing this strength. Special attacks show the unparalleled strength of the Japanese spirit, but if we do not gather the essence of Japanese science and cause it to erupt, it will not work. Whether it is airplanes, bombs, quantity, or speed, they must all be crystallized by the full force of Japanese science. Today, under the divinely bestowed geographical advantages of Okinawa, this opportunity must not be missed. The Japanese people must rouse their general scientific spirit and quickly prepare a state of affairs with absolute strength to defeat the enemy. The 'certain kill and certain hit' special attack tactic can only exert its true power when it is born from the foundation of overall strength."</p>
<p>The moon rose to the window, and chickens were already crowing somewhere. The time to take off was approaching. (Report by Miyamoto's Reporting Team) (Translated from the Yomiuri Hochi, May 8th)</p>
<p>Japanese Shinrai Special Attack Corps Achieves Results that Shock the Enemy Camp - Navy Ministry Issues Special Commendation for its Meritorious Deeds</p>
<p>Tokyo, December 29th, Central News Agency: The Navy Ministry of Japan announced on the 28th that the Commander of the Combined Fleet had commended the Shinrai Special Attack Corps, which had repeatedly launched attacks in the sea south of the Japanese mainland and around Okinawa since the end of March of the 20th year of Showa (1945), and that its magnificent fighting spirit and the power to sink with one shot had shocked the enemy camp. This announcement is made to the entire army to commend its meritorious deeds.</p>
<p>Tokyo, December 29th, Central News Agency: The Japanese Shinrai Air Corps is the highest peak of the aviation special attack force. The scene of its vigorous fighting spirit and terrifying power erupting fiercely on the enemy's head is like a thunderbolt, extremely violent. In the past, special attack planes were bombers or fighters, with special explosive devices attached, and the plane itself was a bomb. The Shinrai aircraft is a so-called mother-child aircraft. Special attack team members board a bomb with wings, like a small plane, which is towed under the chest of the mother plane. The mother plane flies near enemy ships, releases the manned bomb, and then it dives at a high speed. From this, it can be seen that the training of the Japanese Air Corps not only focuses on aviation technology, but all team members also receive training in aviation special attacks or Shinrai special attacks. The intense fighting spirit and great power of these brave warriors will continue to manifest over the heads of the enemy forces.</p>
<h3>A Solemn Scene of Team Members Setting Out on a Mission</h3>
<p>Front-line Naval Base, December 28th, Central News Agency: The Japanese Shinrai Attack Corps is currently continuing operations in the waters of Okinawa. April 16th was the fifth time they went into battle, targeting enemy ships in the sea west of Okinawa. That morning, the Shinrai Attack Corps set out from the base. The Japanese Navy and Army air control units also intercepted enemy fighter groups in the sky over the Amami Oshima and Kikaijima areas, clearing the path for the special attack planes to advance. The Kamikaze, Showa, Tsukuba, and Nanao teams of bombers continuously attacked the enemy's mobile force in the ocean east of Amami Oshima. The Japanese Army and Navy special attack forces launched a large-scale attack on enemy ships around Okinawa. During this general air attack, Lieutenant Miyashita and four other members of the Shinrai team boarded an attack plane commanded by Lieutenant Sawai and set out. Lieutenants Miyashita and Sawai had cooperated repeatedly during training, and this time they happened to be in the same plane, setting off from the base. As they reached a point not far from the front line of the decisive battle, both of them became nervous. At 7:00, Lieutenant Miyashita, resting his cheek on his hand while sitting in the commander's seat, was urged by Lieutenant Sawai, "The time has come, get on board." Lieutenant Miyashita replied, "Yes," and immediately got into the Shinrai device. Suddenly, white waves were seen ahead, and the enemy ship had been discovered. The signalman sent a telegram to the base reporting the discovery of the attack target. The enemy force consisted of one battleship and two unidentified types of ships. Then, a second report was sent: "The Shinrai has attacked the enemy ship." The following is the report from Lieutenant Sawai after completing the attack mission: "The enemy ships were heading towards us. Our special attack air team took advantage of this excellent opportunity, fired the Shinrai, and retreated. In an instant, we discovered that the attack was successful. I was overjoyed and tapped the operator on the shoulder, saying, 'Wonderful!' The enemy seemed to fire two or three rounds, but at this time, we saw thick smoke covering the sea surface, and nothing could be seen after a while. This moment of intense tension, as if hundreds of thunderbolts were exploding at once, shook the sea and air.</p>
<h3>American Magazine Describes New Japanese Weapons</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, December 29th, Central News Agency: The American magazine "Time" reported on new Japanese weapons that first appeared on the Okinawa battlefield as follows: "The Japanese are using strange small airplanes, which have appeared in the Pacific. These airplanes are also suicide planes, in which the pilot must die with the plane. This weapon, which first appeared on the Okinawa battlefield, weighs two tons and is launched by wooden aircraft. First, a mother ship carries it to an altitude of 1,000 meters and drops the unmanned rocket. The nose of the manned rocket is a large bomb. It has a wingspan of sixteen feet, a fuselage length of twenty feet, a continuous flight distance of thirty-five to forty miles, and a speed of four hundred to seven hundred miles per hour. The rear is equipped with a pair of rudders."</p>
<h3>European and American Military Restrict Transfers to the Pacific</h3>
<p>Lisbon, December 29th, Central News Agency: According to reports, the Supreme Headquarters of the Allied Forces in Europe has announced that any soldier who has fought in the European theater of operations and who has actually participated in battles in Sicily, Corsica, Sardinia, or the various islands of Italy, may not be transferred to the Pacific theater of operations unless they volunteer. However, this only applies to soldiers, and officers are not included.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Okinawa Battle and the Japanese Spirit</h3>
<p>The battle on Okinawa Island is still raging fiercely. According to a United Press reporter in the war zone, "In the past month, the US military has been facing ideal difficulties in its operations in Okinawa, and has only advanced three miles on the front line. Optimists in the past believed that the US military would soon capture Shuri and advance into Naha, but to this day, Naha has not been occupied, and Shuri is still on the periphery." From this, it can be seen the fierceness of the Okinawa battle, the difficulty of realizing the enemy's ambitions, and the severity of the blows they have received.</p>
<p>Secondly, Allied special attack large formations are constantly launching three-dimensional attacks on the enemy, destroying various enemy facilities. Furthermore, on the moonlit night of the 24th of this month, the "Giretsu Airborne Unit" led by Army Captain Okudo Saburo suddenly landed at the northern and central airfields on Okinawa Island, immediately destroying enemy aircraft and military supply warehouses on the ground, and other airfield facilities, causing the enemy to be in a state of chaos. At the same time, to coordinate with the airborne unit's surprise attack, other special attack forces launched fierce attacks on enemy ships around Okinawa. The land garrison forces also had high morale and fought bravely. Therefore, even the enemy's commander, Nimitz, had to acknowledge in his headquarters' communiqué that the Japanese army was cooperating on land and sea, and that the attacks were brave. This attack by the special attack force was the most intense since the beginning of the war.</p>
<p>It has been more than two months since the enemy's mobile force appeared in the sea off Kyushu. During these two months, the European war situation has taken a sharp turn for the worse, and the tides of international politics have been no less turbulent than the war situation. However, the East Asian war situation has not been affected due to the marvelous bravery of the Allied forces on Okinawa Island. Furthermore, the recent months of relentless machinations by the enemy, and the blitzkrieg strategy, have been shattered.</p>
<p>The brave operations of the Allied forces in the Okinawa battle have bought sufficient time, creating favorable conditions in advance for the defense of the Japanese mainland. Therefore, this war result is by no means merely the material result of sinking and destroying enemy fleets, etc. This success, in addition to the excellent command of the Allied forces' supreme operations authorities, and the self-sacrificing spirit of the special attack warriors, must also be especially attributed to the Japanese spirit.</p>
<p>In fact, the Japanese spirit has no particular mystique. The only ones who regard the Japanese spirit as having some kind of "mystery" are the enemy and American authorities, who are materialists, and this arises from their astonishment and panic. In reality, the Japanese spirit is precisely the Japanese people's love for their own country, love for the peoples of Greater East Asia, and the idea of sacrificing oneself to protect the masses in order to strive for the liberation and freedom of Greater East Asia. Hence, there are the righteous and heroic acts of "one plane, one ship" and "one death, a hundred kills," which astonish the enemy and make them think of it as "mysterious." But in our Eastern peoples, this is precisely the expression of the highest spirit of mankind, "sacrificing one's life for righteousness" and "laying down one's life to achieve righteousness." I, myself, am a student, who is participating. Therefore, there is no "mystery" as the enemy sees it, but rather it is the crystallization of science and spiritual power.</p>
<p>As Captain Matsumoto said: "We destroy the enemy by using our spirit of generosity that transcends life and death, and our firm belief. This is the spirit of Marshal Togo, and also the spirit of Bushido inherent in Japan... Now the enemy is trying to balance our spirit with their material quantity, but material quantity is ultimately limited, while our spirit is unlimited." This Japanese spirit has been fully demonstrated in the Okinawa Island battle. In this urgent decisive battle stage, only by developing this spiritual power to a greater extent can we strive for victory. We are standing on the same battle line. How will our entire people, especially the general university students, develop the spirit of the Eastern peoples? This is truly worthy of deep reflection.</p>
<p>Enemy Planes Attack Yokohama, Seventy Destroyed; Some Invade Kawasaki and Tokyo</p>
<p>Tokyo, December 29th, Central News Agency: The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 5:00 PM on the 29th: "From 9:39 AM on the 29th, for about an hour and a half, approximately 500 enemy B29-type planes, along with approximately 100 P51-type planes, mainly attacked Yokohama, and some invaded Kawasaki and Tokyo, dropping incendiary bombs and indiscriminately bombing urban areas, causing considerable damage to Yokohama." Among the results achieved by the Japanese air defense units, it has now been confirmed that 30 were shot down and approximately 40 were destroyed.</p>
<p>Tokyo, December 29th, Central News Agency: Approximately 500 enemy B29-type planes, supplemented by 100 P51-type planes, invaded the Yokohama area in waves from around 8:30 AM on the 29th for about an hour and a half, dropping incendiary bombs from an altitude of 5,000 meters and indiscriminately bombing urban areas. Another part of the force attacked Kawasaki and Tokyo, dropping incendiary bombs. The "Lomo Bombing Group" from the Mariana Islands base had already carried out large-scale bombings of Tokyo again on the 24th, from dawn, and from the night of the 25th until dawn on the 26th, each with approximately 250 planes. Only one day later, there was a third attack with a large number of approximately 500 planes, which shows that the enemy air force strength at the Mariana Islands base has recently increased dramatically. With this expanded air force, they are attempting to quickly disrupt the Japanese production system, showing that the enemy's fighting spirit is extremely fierce. Furthermore, P51-type planes from the Iwo Jima base attacked in coordination with the B29-type planes in a large formation of 100 planes. This is the first time this has happened, and future trends in enemy bombing operations on the Japanese mainland are extremely noteworthy.</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Attacking Guanmen All Damaged</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency dispatch) Twelve B-29 type enemy planes from a southern base attacked Hakata Bay and the Guanmen area at dawn on the 28th, dropping naval mines in an attempt to cut off Japanese shipping lanes. Japanese air defense forces fiercely engaged them, shooting down four and destroying eight, severely damaging all attacking enemy planes. The eight damaged planes attempted to escape towards the Bungo Strait, but their hopes of returning to their southern base seem to be dashed.</p>
<h3>Conflicts Frequently Erupt Between Chongqing U.S. Soldiers</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch: According to well-informed sources, the May 17th editorial of the Chongqing "Shishi Xinbao" [Current Affairs News] stated that due to the changing war situation, Chinese territory is gradually becoming an important operational area, and therefore the number of American troops stationed in China is increasing daily. At the same time, unpleasant conflicts between Chongqing and American soldiers have frequently occurred in the past, and are now increasing, which is truly regrettable. It is hoped that the Chongqing and U.S. authorities will find ways to prevent the recurrence of such conflicts. Furthermore, according to a May 27th TASS dispatch from Chongqing, for the sake of comforting British and American soldiers, a plan to establish an international club in the area will soon be implemented. It was also reported that approximately fifty American military police have been stationed in Chongqing, secretly monitoring the movements of American soldiers. This measure is a well-known fact among the citizens of Chongqing. Conflicts and emotional discord between Chongqing residents and American soldiers have been rumored for over a year. It is also rumored that special reception centers have been established in Chongqing, Kunming, and other places to comfort American soldiers, with young women serving as receptionists. However, incidents of misconduct by American soldiers have gradually increased. In Kunming alone, there are more than twenty such cases each month. Local media have generally remained silent in the past, but currently, newspapers are paying close attention to such disputes, and they can be seen in news reports and commentaries, as the facts are obvious and cannot be concealed.</p>

<h3>Current Situation in Yixing</h3>
<p>— Xun Ze</p>
<h3>Historical Evolution and Location</h3>
<p>Yixing was called Yangxian in the Tai Dynasty, and belonged to Yixing Prefecture in the Jin Dynasty. Subsequently, Yangxian County was changed to Yixing County, both belonging to Changzhou Prefecture. During the reign of Emperor Taizong of the Song Dynasty, Yixing was changed to Yixing County to avoid the emperor's taboo name. During the Qing Dynasty, it was divided into Yixing and Jingxi counties. In the Republic of China, they were merged into Yixing County.</p>
<p>Yixing is located on the west bank of Tai Lake, bordering Changxing in Zhejiang to the south, Guangde in Anhui to the southwest, Liyang to the west, Tai Lake to the northwest, and Jintan Lake and Wujin to the north, covering an area of one hundred and sixty-seven square hours.</p>
<h3>Mountains, Rivers, and Terrain</h3>
<p>The southwest is mostly mountainous, while the rest is flat and fertile land. The southwest is full of towering peaks and picturesque streams and mountains. In times of war, it often serves as a crucial gateway. For example, during the Jiazi Qilu War and the current incident, heavy troops were stationed in Zhangzhu, Huwen, and Dingshu Mountains. Xiangwang Ridge, Ming Ridge, Xianjiao Ridge, Zhuomu Ridge, and other places were important for attack and defense. The mountains come from Zhejiang and Anhui, which are branches of the Nanling Mountains. In terms of water, there is Tai Lake to the east, Hu Lake and Tao Lake to the northwest, and Jingxi River running horizontally through east and west. The Grand Canal connects to Wujin and Wuxi in the north. The ports and rivers are crisscrossed like spider webs, making boat transportation very convenient. Tao, Hu, and the water from the mountains in the southwest flow downstream in Shanxi, and Dongjiu splits into Bai, reaching Tai Lake and entering the sea.</p>
<h3>Products</h3>
<p>The county is rich in products, with rice and wheat as the main crops. Vegetables include turnips, taro, lily bulbs, yams, bamboo shoots, and other melons and vegetables, especially abundant on Tai Lake and Maishang. Fruits include chestnuts, pears, peaches, persimmons, pomegranates, ginkgo, etc. The main mountain products include Mao bamboo, Shui bamboo, and Gang bamboo, which are usually sold far to Shandong Province. Pine and fir are the most abundant types of wood, but transportation is inconvenient, so they are often sold as sawn timber. The mountains also have many bears, rabbits, wild boars, wild goats, and other wild animals, with tigers and leopards occasionally appearing. The lakes are rich in fish and shrimp. In addition, tea, charcoal, coal, stone, silk, paper, and other products are also produced in large quantities. However, due to transportation difficulties, heavy taxes, and the mountains being military restricted areas, production has decreased, and the mountain people are impoverished.</p>
<h3>Transportation</h3>
<p>Yicheng is the center of the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway and the starting point of the Yichang Highway. The Yichang Highway is still in good condition, and cars come and go every day. Waterways connect to Wujin and Wuxi by steamboats. However, due to the current situation, they often cannot operate on schedule. Private boats are irregular, causing problems from time to time.</p>
<h3>Administration and Public Security</h3>
<p>The highest administrative organ is the county government, located at the former site of the Yixing County Girls' Middle School. The county is still divided into eight districts, each with a district chief, followed by the township and Baojia system. Under the jurisdiction of the New Fourth Army, Yixing is divided into Wuyi County in the northeast and Yili County in the southwest. The district system has also been greatly changed. The county government is mobile and uncertain, and the township and Baojia chiefs are mostly ambiguous. In terms of public security, the key border areas are mostly garrisoned by friendly troops and the Peace Army, while the new areas are guarded by the county security team, which is regularly transferred. In addition, the Lu Cha General Bureau is set up in Yicheng, still using the original site of the Chenghuang Temple as its office. Branch offices are set up in Heqiao, Gao, Guancun, Xushe, Zhangzhu, Zhou Tieqiao, Dingshan, and Song, and police stations are set up in Shushan, Hongtatou, Fandaoshe, and Yitingqiao to maintain local public security.</p>
<h3>Education</h3>
<p>Primary and secondary education are numerous but of poor quality. Schools with both high school and junior high school departments include Yixing Middle School in the city, Yixing Middle School in Shushan, Fucun Middle School in the Third District, Hongyi Middle School, Xiafang Middle School in the Second District, Sanzhou Vocational Middle School in Xujing in the Eighth District, Xisheng Middle School in Heqiao, and Sunan Middle School in Xushe. There are Zhangzhu Middle School, Jingtang Middle School, Yantouqiao Middle School, Fangqiao Middle School, Zhuxi Middle School in Zhou Tieqiao, Chongde Middle School in Tangxia, and Pengcheng Middle School in Heqiao. The only special school is the Suzhou Academy of Fine Arts in Fenshuidun near Caoqiao. Elementary schools are everywhere. However, due to a shortage of teachers, those who are inadequate often fill the positions. Educational funding is subsidized by local public funds for elementary schools, while middle schools are mostly self-sufficient and live within their means. Students' tuition fees and staff salaries are calculated in kind - rice. The average tuition rice per semester is five dou for elementary schools and nine dou for middle schools. Staff monthly rice is on average one shi and five dou for elementary schools, and about three shi for middle schools, but it depends on income.</p>
<h3>Urban Conditions</h3>
<p>The total population of Yixing County was 580,000 before the incident. There are no accurate statistics on the number of incidents. The original area of farmland was more than 1.67 million mu, but after land surveys, it is more than 1.46 million mu. The county seat has a circumference of nine li, located between the east and west Jiu Rivers. The incident destroyed three-fifths of the city, half destroyed by aircraft bombs and half destroyed by theft. It is currently making efforts to revive, with Jiaqiao as the center, building roads in all directions. However, the section to the west has not yet been constructed due to the low terrain. Except for the original city gates, the West Gate and the North Jiazi Gate, which are closed, all others are accessible. A new North Gate has been opened, directly facing Jiaqiao, creating a magnificent appearance. The South Street is more prosperous. Heqiao Town, thirty li north of Yicheng, is the economic center of the county. Financial institutions such as Ronghe, Yonglong, and Xingye money houses can provide remittances. Dingshan and Shushan Towns in the southeast are pottery production areas and are very lively. Zhangzhu, Xushe, Yangxiang in the southwest, and Heqiao in the north once had their market houses destroyed and donated, and most of them have been rebuilt.</p>
<h3>People's Livelihood and Prices</h3>
<p>The county was originally a land of fish and rice, with a comfortable life. Since the incident, the numerous taxes - rice tax, wheat tax, firewood tax, mountain goods tax - have been levied on everything and taxed on every action, making it difficult for the people to survive. Many fair-minded people avoid suspicion and withdraw, or close their doors and act nobly, while treacherous people run rampant and act illegally. The authorities should pay close attention to this social worry. In mid-May, the price of white rice was 75,000 yuan per shi, green wheat was 15,000 yuan per shi, soybeans were 80,000 yuan per shi, pork was 1,000 yuan per jin, soybean oil was 1,800 yuan per jin, salt was 600 yuan per jin, and mountain firewood was 2,000 yuan per dan.</p>
<p>In short, Yixing is a border area in Jiangsu Province, and the social situation is extremely complex. The troops entering and exiting include friendly troops, the Harmony Army, the New Fourth Army, the local security team, and other miscellaneous troops. Most of the supplies, except for a few troops, are collected through taxes from merchants and farmers, so the people suffer unbearably.</p>

<h3>Authorities Discuss Measures for People's Food Prices Chen Shilong Returns to Nanjing After Completing Public Duties in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Recently, the price rise in Shanghai has been severe, especially the main commodities have risen the most sharply, among which the hoarding and speculation by merchants are the biggest problem, which has a great impact on people's livelihood and public security. Minister of Industry and Commerce Chen Jun visited Shanghai a few days ago to inquire about the actual situation of price increases from relevant authorities, to seek measures to stabilize prices, and decided to take the most severe measures to crack down on and punish speculative merchants' hoarding and speculation. With regard to the supply of food for the people, a solution has also been discussed, and all difficulties can be resolved soon. It is reported that Minister Chen has temporarily completed his tasks in Shanghai and returned to Nanjing yesterday.</p>
<h3>Lending Checks, Firms Will Not Pay Silver and Money Industry Federation Decides</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Banking Association recently received letters from its members stating that each bank has listed account numbers when opening accounts for current or business deposits, and engraved them on the checks to be used for review and inspection, and also to protect depositors. However, if B holds A's account number check for cashing, it can be detected immediately and interrogated, but the account number is not based on the bill law, so it is not a check requirement, but in practice, it is not without value.</p>
<p>Three doubts</p>
<p>There are now several issues that raise questions: 1. A and B both have accounts in the same bank. One day, A did not carry a checkbook, so he took B's check, personally stamped it, and withdrew money from A's own account. The seal is consistent, but the account number and check number are inconsistent. Can the bank pay? 2. Suppose A crosses out the account number on the borrowed check, rewrites A's account number, and changes A's seal at the correction, and A still stamps the signature. Can the bank pay this check? 3. Suppose the correction uses B's seal, and A stamps A's seal on the signature. Can the bank pay this check? The above three items will cause questions among the peers, please check and submit them to the meeting for discussion. The association has forwarded the letter to the Banking Society for research.</p>
<p>Easy to Cause Malpractice</p>
<p>According to the Banking Society, after detailed research on this matter, it is believed that the account number on the check is indeed convenient for review and inspection, and has the intention of protecting depositors. If depositors are allowed to borrow it back and forth, it is very easy to cause malpractice. In the above situation, if someone did not borrow someone's check, but someone stole someone's seal, the bank would rely on it to pay someone's account, which would inevitably cause disputes. In other words, if payment can be made in this way, then only those who steal other people's seals can achieve the purpose of fraudulently collecting money. In order to protect the interests of depositors and avoid the bank's liability, it is best not to allow borrowing of other people's checks. Regardless of any of the above situations for using checks, it is inconvenient to pay. It is best to unify this situation in each bank. Later, the association submitted it to the silver industry joint meeting, which believed that the silver money industry used it to show consistency, and immediately notified each bank and Zhuang to comply. It is reported that the money industry peers have always denied borrowing other people's checks, so they also notified each Zhuang for reference.</p>
<h3>Comprehensive Promotion of Sino-Japanese Culture, Establishment of the Japan-China Association: Minister Matsudaira Answers Reporters' Questions</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy held its regular press conference at 3:00 PM. Minister of Information Matsudaira met with Chinese journalists to discuss recent international developments in detail. The reporters inquired about the nature of the recently established Japan-China Association in Japan. Minister Matsudaira provided a detailed explanation, stating that when the National Government of China returned to Nanjing, both China and Japan deeply felt the necessity of cultural exchange between the two countries, hence the organization of cultural associations. On the Japanese side, due to historical and traditional ties, the China-Japan Cultural Association was first established by the Chinese side, with branches set up throughout the country. Now, on the Japanese side, in view of the comprehensive promotion and development of Sino-Japanese culture, a need was strongly felt, and at the same time, to facilitate the unified control of various domestic cultural groups and institutions, the Japan-China Association was recently established. The nature of this association is purely that of a cultural organization.</p>
<h3>Land Tax Conference Passes Method of Collecting in Kind</h3>
<p>In order to enrich municipal financial revenue and strengthen the collection of land tax, the Municipal Finance Bureau convened a land tax conference, which was officially held yesterday (the 29th) at 3:00 PM in the City Hall conference room. The meeting was personally presided over by Luo Junqiang, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government and Director of the Finance Bureau. Attendees included the county magistrates of Nanhui, Fengxian, Jiading, Chongming, Baoshan, Chuansha, and Shenjiang, as well as the heads of county finance bureaus, Xu Songping, Chief Secretary of the Municipal Finance Bureau, Qiu Tianfang, Head of the Land Tax Section, and others. Director Luo delivered an opening speech, explaining the significance of land tax and the key points of implementing collection in kind. Subsequently, nine proposals from various county governments and finance bureaus were discussed. Finally, a method for collecting land tax in kind was approved: Rice should be collected uniformly in the urban area. The counties should primarily collect rice, and should collect as much rice as possible. If it is indeed a non-rice-producing area, wheat may be collected instead. The conversion ratio is 16 *shi jin* of rice for 40 *shi jin* of wheat. However, it is absolutely forbidden to convert the collected rice into wheat, or to collect neither rice nor wheat and convert it into currency. The meeting adjourned successfully around 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Application for Brown Sugar Temporarily Suspended</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office, which handles the special distribution of brown sugar, is currently experiencing a surge in applications from pregnant women, resulting in a backlog of cases that cannot be reviewed in a timely manner and are awaiting clearance.

Schools and institutions can prepare the necessary procedures and claim the funds at the Bureau.</p>
<h3>Police Bureau Orders Officers to Diligently Perform Their Duties</h3>
<p>The Municipal Police Bureau believes that civil servants who are paid to serve the public should dedicate themselves to the country and be selfless. At this time of transition, it is especially necessary for each officer to stay at their posts and diligently perform their duties to uphold the law. Recently, it has been found that dozens of officers and police from various divisions and teams under the Bureau request leave every day, which severely affects public affairs. Hereafter, leave will not be granted unless due to illness or special circumstances. An order has been issued to all subordinates to comply. At the same time, all officers and police must strive to serve and fulfill their duties. Whether on internal or external duty, all personnel must fulfill their responsibilities and must not be absent without reason or neglect their posts. The Inspectorate is ordered to conduct strict inspections. Violations will be severely punished in accordance with the Provisional Regulations on Extraordinary Rewards and Punishments.</p>

Checking essentials are to indicate a certain standard.</p>
<p>Fire Prevention Equipment</p>
<p>Fire prevention equipment and its materials include (A) Water (containers), including water storage pools and other containers. Inspection items: Do not neglect the container; it must be permanent and suitable for practical use. Prepare the amount of water appropriate for the size of the house.

(B) Soil and sand. Inspection items: Each household requires about 2.5 *dou* or more. Be sure to place the appropriate amount in each room, in a place that is easy to use. Place it in sandbags or suitable containers for easy use. (You can use the soil excavated from personal air defense trenches. If there is no sand, you can use soil or dry earth). (C) Mat bags, etc. Inspection items: Each household must have five sheets. Larger houses must be equipped with more. Prepare them on each floor and in each room, in places where you can immediately deal with incendiary bombs. However, the ropes of the mat bags must be untied, and the mats placed similarly.

Families that cannot build outdoor air defense trenches should set up indoor shelters. Basement shelters, etc., must have an escape exit in addition to the entrance. High-rise buildings should be equipped with protective facilities for application. A large number of uncovered personal trenches should be built. Guidance should be given to strengthen the fragile forms of air defense trenches. Launch an air defense trench repair and cleaning campaign. (B) Air Defense Cellars.

(B) Light shielding equipment inspection items: All equipment must be durable and not just for the sake of appearance. Deep paper shades, deep metal shades, cloth shades, flat shades, etc., should be used appropriately and prepared according to the number of lights used. (C) Light shielding material inspection items: Houses that need to turn on lights during control must prepare shading curtains, black cardboard windows, and other applicable shading materials.

Fire prevention materials should be set up on each floor of the house. Citizens should pay close attention to the above points, and the department's party members will inspect each household.</p>
<h3>How to Make Air Defense Hoods</h3>
<p>Here is a special introduction to how to make air defense hoods for practical use against fire, bombs, and cold protection:</p>
<p>Gauze is the best material, but other materials can also be used if there is no gauze. The inside should be made of cotton with a thickness of more than three centimeters, and about four and a half *chi* of cloth and towel are needed.</p>
<p>(Cutting method) The dimensions in the left diagram are the standard dimensions for women. Head circumference is 50 cm, height is 155 cm. Based on the above assumed dimensions, cut a paper pattern according to the left diagram, adding or subtracting as needed. Before cutting the cloth, straighten it first and estimate the size of the cloth needed. The sewing allowance should be one centimeter.</p>
<p>(Sewing method) Fold and gather the pointed notch of the hood and sew it from the top of the head to the neckline. Sew the rounded corners of the shoulders of the left figure (B) and (C) together. Attach the towel (E) to the inside of the right side and sew it in the middle. Sew the inner and outer edges of the hat brim together, sandwiching the core. Sew the center of the hood (referring to the thread) to the center of the hat brim and sew the hat brim between the inside and outside of the hood. Sew the shoulder cloth to the jacket, leaving only the neckline unsewn. The upper part of the mask must be opened and sewn to the jacket from three sides.</p>
<p>(How to fill the cotton) Fill the cotton into the head cloth, shoulder cloth, and mask according to the thickness on the right side. Sew the neckline of the surface together and fold the thread to the right side. Add buttons in a suitable wearing position. Add a thread loop on the right side. All seams are sewn on the inside. After the entire garment is finished, it can be stitched according to the diagram.</p>
