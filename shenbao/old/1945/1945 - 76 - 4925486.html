<p>社評</p>
<h3>實業家打開出路</h3>
<p>實業家經營業，大抵有兩個目的，其一是營利，其二是服務。簡單的說，就是利已與利人。在守成這兩個目的的經營過程中，應該保持着平衡的方向，然後這個實業必能發展，必能久遠。如果營利的目的超過了服務的目的，就是只顧自己發財而不計大衆便利，其經營結果縱然他們的實業發達，個人成功，可是，他的實業在整個社會中沒有鞏固的地位，在大衆的心目中更沒有好的印象，因此，至多在他的一生是一帆順，而實業本身將不能垂之久遠。而且，因爲經營目的偏重了營利以後，對於職工的待遇，必然降低，對於資產盈利，不肯公開，一方面足以阻止實業的進展，一方面得不到社會的同情，都是不能垂之久遠的因素。所以，凡是目光遠大的實業家，必定採取利已並利人的經營方針的。</p>
<p>反之，如果服務的目的超過了營利的目的，則在目前中國的經濟社會以及國家對於實業的獎助能力之下，爲維持本身實業的存在，以及儲有逐漸擴展的資力計，事實上確有困難的。所以，我們姑作假定，公營實業，應該是服務目的超過營利目的，甚至完全服務爲目的，而私營實業，則服務目的應與營利目的相等。</p>
<p>上面的論列，我們認爲是目前實業家經營實業　應具的態度。經營實業，旣然有一半是以服務爲目爲，那末，所經營的實業不能因爲一時的環境所阻，或是無利可圖，就停止經營。進一步說，雖在環境所阻或無利可圖的情形下，如果爲了達成服務目的，也須排除困難打開出路，一且獲得繼續經營以後，服務目的能够完成，則營利目的也必可以達到。</p>
<p>上海向爲全國工商業中心，也就是實業家經營實業的集中地，現在因爲動力限制，原料困難，運輸阻滯等等原因，工業生產陷於停滯，金融商業隨之淸談，而近年工商界的盈利頗豐，資力雄厚，同時，在此決戰階段，不僅上述促成秤停滯的原因，一時無法消解，而且更有迭受其他戰時損害的可能，在這種情勢推移之下，實業家決不能袖手等待，爲繼續經營以及奠定未來基礎打算，必須謀打開出路之道。</p>
<p>這去上海的工業製品，大部分運銷於內地農村，所以，我們主張上海的實業家們，應即考慮往內地各縣投資，創設各種日用品小型工廠。利用各地的特產原料，譬如江蘇的丹陽縣出產糯米，可以創設酒精廠，以糯米提練酒精。至於安置失業職工。减輕社會問題之嚴重性，尤屬切要。</p>
<p>本報二月二十四日社評論工業疏散，對於工廠遷移的實施問題，已曾提出若干建議，我們認爲在此時期，無論爲實業家本身的打算，爲國家經濟打算，都有從速考慮打開出路的必要。今天報載各都市工廠遷移淮海省的消息，實部極關懷，希望主管當局與實業界人士，進一步商討積極進行辦法，以期實現。</p>
<p>工廠遷移問題　實部硏究對策　淮海省郝省長表示歡迎</p>
<p>南京十六日中央社電　上海，無錫，鎭江，蚌埠等地各民需工塲，目前由於原料困難，動力不足，大部分陷於停頓狀態。反觀以豐產原料物資及煤炭著稱之淮海省，亦有不能將出產暢運至各工塲需要地區，此種畸形現象，皆由於運輸問題之能暢通。目前增加生產安定民生，進而謀增强戰力，已刻不容緩，是故邇來各有關方面對此問題，無不異常重視，而冀謀求一合理辦法。有一部份人士倡議將上海等地之工廠，移駐於淮海地區，繼續生產，對此，日前郝省長晋京時，曾發表談話，決予全力協助，歡迎各工廠從速遷移。聞實業部當局對此亦至爲關懷，正積極硏討具體對策，力謀早日實現，以資振興工業。日前並已派員分赴上海等地詢問各工廠意見，以供參考。</p>
<h3>渝軍十師　集安南邊境</h3>
<p>廣州十六日中央社電　日軍淸搜尋越南敵性勢力之消息，予重慶抗戰陣營以重大打繫，今後動向頗値重視。</p>
<p>廣州十六日中央社電　澮方對安南之接近伴同物資反攻之軍事行動積極推進，其企圖有二：　在切斷連絡中國大陸與南方之縱貫鐵路，　在恢復安南援蔣之輸血路。重慶更趁安南軍備脆弱之際，於安南國境集結大軍約十師，從事威脅，法國之勢力亦日趨沒落，重慶素日垂涎安南之豪富資源，一心懷柔華僑，欲圖榨取其物資，今後其陰謀更以先發制於人手段，對於重慶此種企圖，日軍將予以迎頭痛繫，故重慶各界甚至推測日軍次期戰略爲進攻昆明，頗爲戰戰兢兢。</p>
<h3>邱吉爾蒸歐戰　可早日結束　力言對日作戰困難</h3>
<p>瑞典京城十六日中央社電　英首相邱吉爾於十六日出席保守黨大會，向黨代表約二千名演說。首爲對德軍之戰鬥，極爲順利進行，故歐戰可望早日結束。次言及東亞之反攻作戰，謂對日軍之作戰並非受人力資源之限制，而實係由於船舶之不足，於大海及業林中，運輸極爲困難。</p>
<p>瑞典京城十六日中央社電　海通社訊：邱吉爾昨在保守黨大會中宣稱：歐戰結束前，本人若再奉命組織新閣，將再樹立一「混合政府」，爲廣羅英材計，非但延攬保守黨員，且將綱羅各黨之俊彥，庶幾行政人材可極一時之選，此次議員改選後，國人若仍願吾人秉政，則政府將逐步改革。</p>
<h3>魯爾薩爾河間　美軍增援</h3>
<p>柏林十六日中央社電　海通社訊：美軍在摩塞爾河下游，設立橋頭堡數座，魯爾與薩爾兩河間，美軍有援兵開到，向東推進，戰事益烈。萊因東岸霍尼夫與霍寗根之間，美軍橋頭堡現有十七公里寬八公里深，內有五師兵力集合於一特別軍之下，該橋頭堡之南北兩端，敵軍方圖擴展，但遭遇德軍堅强抵抗。</p>
<h3>應付决定性戰爭　須持以堅忍　郭培爾博士發表論文</h3>
<p>柏林十六日中央社電　德國社訊，德宣傳部培爾在國家週刋爲文稱：每次戰爭之主要任務，即爲分別强國與弱國，而使適者生存，凡在戰時無成就之國家，將無再圖發展之可能，而勝利者則將獲得更多之機會。爲應付此決定性時期，必須堅忍　戰爭初期中若有錯誤尙可補救，戰爭即將結束時之錯誤，則無可挽回。交戰國雙方皆以其全力從事最後一戰，其能不顧一切以作戰而謀獲得最有利之和平者，則獲勝之機會最高。</p>
<h3>德軍利用時機　增强柏林防務</h3>
<p>蘇黎世十六日中央社電　據莫斯科電：刻正積極推進防衛工作之德國，刻在任命卞爾登布朗那上將爲柏林前綫總司令，按該上將爲奧大利人，曾任奧大利保安委員等職，爲希姆萊因內軍司令之心腹</p>
<p>瑞典京城十六日中央社電　海通社訊：蘇軍進攻柏林之前綫至特萊斯登一帶，情形日益緊張。</p>
<h3>渝發言人宣稱　新疆發生騷亂</h3>
<p>中央社電　據某方接到情報，重慶發言人蔣廷　，十四日發表談話謂，新疆省發生騷亂事件，確係事實，然哥薩克人佔據廣大地域之事尙未證實。美報盛傳蔣介石將出席舊金山會議說不確，因五月六日重慶舉行國民大會，蔣必須到會，不能離國也。</p>
<h3>硫黃島上　日軍守備隊戰况</h3>
<p>美機動隊的連續襲繫日本本土，即爲硫黃島上陸作戰的掩護行動，由此足見硫黃島的戰略價値在敵軍限中殊爲重大。對此蕞爾小島，不惜投下多量的鋼鐵，猛轟狂炸之後，美軍遂開始登陸。這個激戰中的硫黃島，究竟是怎樣一個島嶼呢？島上的守軍如何抗戰呢？</p>
<p>不生一草一木</p>
<p>硫黃島的周圍，僅僅不過十餘公里，而菲島·台灣·塞班等相異，全島係由火山灰而成的砂地。島上的　火口，至今猶冒白烟，因地熱之故，自海面吹來的風，立即如熱氣般掩蔽全島，令人有處在土耳其浴室中之感，因而食糧之類極易腐敗，貯藏完全不可能。導上飲用的淡水當然是積靠濾過的海水，但須煮沸才可使用，所以也積藏雨水以供飲用。初抵此島時，因圖掘并取水，曾在噴火口附近發見溫泉，當時大家都不勝歡喜，紛紛跳將下去，誰知全身立刻好像浸在膠水中，類似膩膩地，連頭髪也結成一塊。由於鹽分太多的原故，這種溫泉一點也無用處，結果全體迄今未曾洗過一次澡。而且全島樹木不多，烹調炊煮除利用地熱以外，祗有業生島上的不知名的野草可囑乾了拿來當燃料。現因大砲轟繫，飛機猛炸的緣故，全島的面目爲之一變，簡直沒有一草一木了。可是日軍守備隊的全體士氣依然極其旺盛，個個熱血沸騰，熱烈如火山的氣燄，他們日常所吃的東西，只有囑梅及鹽蘿葡，利用空地種植的蔬菜，也因轟炸的緣故，未能有所收穫。而且，在這「焦熱地獄」的周圍，常有敵方潛水艇埋伏着妨礙補給，並有大型敵機在天空巡邏，嚴密監視日方的行動。因此，每逢養的船隻或飛機街過敵軍的警戒封鎖綫而抵達硫黃島時，守軍便欣慰不已，趕快起卸貨物，以免貴重的給養品白白成爲砲彈炸彈的犧牲品。</p>
<p>美軍不惜工本</p>
<p>美軍的轟炸這個蕞爾小島，可謂不惜工本。至其空製方式，大體將機羣分爲二梯團，一梯團若由五千公尺左右的空中侵入，則另一梯團的高度必爲七·八千公尺，以期如此出其不意的打繫日方防空部隊。到達目標的上空時，就縱橫投彈掃射，簡直沒有空隙，炸彈穴的間隔極小，這一個炸彈所掘起來的灰砂常常埋沒了那一個炸彈所造成的大穴，及至美機退走以後，地面上彷彿波濤起伏的怒海，祗見無數砂丘連綿不絕，完全和我們平常所想的那種空襲後的光景不同。來襲的敵機，每日上午十時總有格拉曼·孔索里·B29約三十架來，晚上則常有一·二架B29型機飛來在四千公尺左右的空中投彈。</p>
<p>日軍堅守決心</p>
<p>總之，硫黃島極少可以利用的東西，向地面掘下去，不到多深就會有海水湧出來，因此絕對不能掘一個可以滿意的壕溝，並因地熱的關係，吹來的風也熱不可耐，非全身露出在地上和來襲的敵軍作戰不可。守軍的辛苦，縱謂之更甚於爪達爾卡拿爾，亦不爲過。但全車的士氣絲毫不衰，死守硫黃島的決心，流露在每個士兵的蒼白臉上。（戶田特派員）（譯自二月二十一日每日新聞）</p>
<h3>曼達萊巷戰激烈　日守軍展開邀繫　在伊洛瓦底線獲大戰果</h3>
<p>緬甸前綫基地十六日中社電　敵第十九師團之主力，爲呼應侵入密克梯拉之敵軍，而於伊洛瓦底江東岸向曼達萊南方推進，五日以來，更自新格橋頭堡南下，八日擁有戰車五輛，敵軍二百，終於穿過日軍陣地，向曼達萊方面進攻，嗣後於曼達萊市街一帶展開巷戒。侵入曼達萊之敵軍，嗣後繼續增强兵力，九日以戰車三十輛，約七百之兵力，復侵入曼達萊公路兩側及市北側一帶，同時並以一部兵力進攻萊丘陵之日軍陣地，日軍當即邀繫，予以重創後，將敵向北方繫圖。然敵軍於十日復以戰車，裝甲車爲先鋒，漸次開始侵入該市北方，與日守軍展開猛烈之巷戰，尤其王城地區一帶，日軍嚴守堅陣，九日以來，終日繼續激戰，將敵軍繫退。繼之，十一日該市周邊之戰事漸次激烈，擁有戰車五輛之一部敵軍，迂迥侵入該市北部，經日軍邀繫，至是日下午予以甚大之損害後，將其繫退，刻下王城及曼達萊丘陵南側，依然爲日軍確保，正對該市周邊之敵軍加以猛烈攻繫。</p>
<p>緬甸前綫十五日中央社電　伊洛瓦底戰綫各處，依然繼續激戰，敵在日軍猛下，受創甚大。日軍自十二月一日於伊洛瓦底開始作戰以來，至三月十五日爲止，所獲之戰果如次：斃敵一萬七千以上，燒毀戰車百六十七輛，繫落飛機七十二架，燒毀載重車二百七十八輛，繫毀或燒毀裝甲車二十一輛，破壞或截獲重輕機槍百二十七挺，迫繫砲二十七門，自動步槍百九十四挺，舟艇百六十二艘及彈藥等甚多。</p>

<h3>太平洋英美艦隊　磨擦日益明顯　松島部長闡明最近戰局</h3>
<p>盟邦日本駐華艦隊報道部報道常，於昨午假餐灣水文社舉行，到松島部長，松本大尉及各報記者等多人，首由松島部長闡述硫黃島菲島·及太平洋戰局，對於太平洋英·美艦隊之不協調，作戰前途之困難，解釋尤詳，會畢歡宴各報記者，情緒融洽，茲將松島部長演詞大要錄後：</p>
<p>硫島日軍堅强抵抗</p>
<p>硫黃島方面，仍以北海岸爲中心，兩方激戰中。敵人用戰車及火燄射繫器，對日陣地猛攻，日軍處於堅固之防禦洞窟內，利用火砲及新銳兵器，作堅强抵抗，殲滅來襲之敵人。八日後日軍一再由陣地出發，衝進敵陣，猛繫敵人，敵方損折員兵人數，在三千以上，並破壞坦克車數輛，池獲兵器輜重甚多。據敵方發表，由硫黃島飛機塲運往夏廠夷之傷兵，平均每日爲二百五十名，根據此項數目，敵方死傷之鉅，可想而知，故硫黃島之作戰，依據敵方宜稱，實爲太平洋上最慘烈之戰爭，而今後日軍更將使敵人大量出血，敵人實無法避免之。</p>
<p>敵機空襲毫無效果</p>
<p>最近敵美運續對日本本本土轟炸，計十一·十二·十四日對東京·名古屋·大阪反覆轟炸。據敵方發表，空製之飛機樂計在五晨架之上。但此種空讀只能使平民房屋損毀一部份，在增强戰力上，毫無效果。其往襲之飛機數目，據日方調查，十日爲一百五十困，十二日一百三十架，十四日一百四十架，逐次遞減，累計約爲三百五十架。在此數目中，被日軍繫下者計五十二架，繫破者一百七十架，合共二百二十二架，實佔其累計數目之百分之六十三，換言之，好爲敵方B29型機之兩個月產量。敵人宣傳對日本本土空襲已使日方遭受相當損失，實則各主要生產機關，早經遷移，完成疏散工作。東京方面遭殃者，僅爲若干平民住宅。即退步言，敵人縱能將東京化爲灰爐，對於章需工廠，仍不能損其毫髪。此次敵人之三度空襲，所獲之結果，爲毀滅其自己的兩個月飛機生產量，是以今後敵人在作戰方面，必困難多端。而且日本國民過去已遭受多次的天災及大火災，習慣已成自然，平民方面即因空襲而損失一部份房屋，實際上並不感覺困難，敵人所宣傳的火災政策，於事無補，日本國民並不覺得嚴重，反而給予老百姓有造新房子的機會，謝謝美國人，尤其羅斯福總統。</p>
<p>菲島美軍無法移動</p>
<p>菲島戰事，以馬尼刺東方巴打雁蒙達班等山岳地帶，以及民答那峨三寶顏等處，激烈戰事在進行中。尤以呂宋島之蒙達班山岳地帶各據點，最爲激烈，有引起大激職之可能。不論如何作戰，日方之最大目標，在使敵人出血，日軍以一貫的作風，從事戰爭，敵人所動用的二十師團兵力，業已被膠着在一起，日軍牽制其兵力，使其無法移動，不能從事於第二期作戰。</p>
<p>殲滅敵艦機會已近</p>
<p>關於馬利亞納敵艦隊如何動向，當亦爲吾人所亟欲知者，其對台灣。琉球之空襲，又與此戰局有關，日方在戰局上對此，實珠注意。上次米內海相在圖會義會席上，表示殲滅人之最好機會已將到來，此言實具有重大意義。日軍神風攻繫隊在鳥路西之役，所獲得之戰果，即屬殲敵之前奏曲，故繫減敵人爲日已近。</p>
<p>英美艦隊無法合作</p>
<p>太平洋英美艦隊之予盾，及內在的磨擦，日益明顯，最進倫敦及紐約方面對英艦隊今後的動向，常常有所發表，尤其爲尼米資及　拉塞之表示，根據此二人之談話。吾人感覺英美海軍間有一絕大之謎隠藏着。推而論之則　英艦隊力量薄弱，　英艦隊行動消極，　美國不願供給英艦隊根據地。在此種之暗礁之下，英美太平洋艦隊今後如何展開其局勢，蓋一極有趣味的問題也。吾人斷言其結果，美國具有於戰後獨覇太平洋的野心。英國一方面欲保護其原來之海上權益，一方面又不顧其艦隊因作戰而受損傷，英美雙方有此種種予盾現象，其欲協力作戰，尙可得乎？根據此點，可知英美作戰無爲其本身利益着想，實爲利益之鬥爭。吾人爲大東亞將來着想，萬一敵人登陸，出其爪牙，而實現利益之鬥爭，則前途將如何耶？故繫滅敵人，必須努力做去。</p>

That night, the Japanese forces bravely fought the enemy who had infiltrated Mount Ten, inflicting numerous casualties, but a portion of the positions was reluctantly lost to the enemy. The enemy began another offensive before dawn on the 14th, with extremely intense artillery fire against the front of their northern positions. Ground fire rained down like bullets. The Japanese garrison inflicted considerable losses by sniping with hand grenades, etc. The enemy's offensive began to weaken at sunset.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Industrialists Open Up a Way Out</h3>
<p>Industrialists engage in business, generally with two objectives: one is to make a profit, and the other is to serve. Simply put, it is to benefit oneself and benefit others. In the business operation that involves maintaining these two objectives, one should maintain a balanced direction. Then this enterprise will inevitably develop and will inevitably last a long time. If the objective of making a profit exceeds the objective of serving, that is, only caring about one's own wealth and not caring about the convenience of the public, the result of the operation, even if their business develops and the individual succeeds, but their business does not have a solid position in the whole society, and there is no good impression in the eyes of the public. Therefore, at most, their life will be smooth, but the business itself will not last long. Moreover, because the business objective is more focused on making a profit, the treatment of workers will inevitably be reduced, and they will be unwilling to disclose asset profits. On the one hand, it is enough to prevent the progress of the enterprise, and on the other hand, it cannot get the sympathy of the society, all of which are factors that cannot last for a long time. Therefore, all far-sighted industrialists will inevitably adopt a business policy that benefits oneself and others.</p>
<p>Conversely, if the objective of serving exceeds the objective of making a profit, then under the current economic society of China and the country's ability to reward and assist enterprises, it is indeed difficult to maintain the existence of the enterprise itself and to store the capital to gradually expand. Therefore, we temporarily assume that public enterprises should have the objective of service exceeding the objective of profit, even completely for the purpose of service, while private enterprises should have the objective of service equal to the objective of profit.</p>
<p>We believe that the above discussion is the attitude that industrialists should have in operating enterprises today. Since half of the operation of an enterprise is for the purpose of service, then the enterprise cannot stop operating because of temporary environmental obstacles or unprofitable reasons. Furthermore, even under the circumstances of environmental obstacles or no profit, if it is for the purpose of achieving service, one must also overcome difficulties and open up a way out. Once one obtains continued operation, the objective of service can be achieved, and then the objective of profit can inevitably be achieved.</p>
<p>Shanghai has always been the national industrial and commercial center, that is, the concentration of industrialists operating enterprises. Now, due to power restrictions, raw material difficulties, transportation obstacles, etc., industrial production is in a state of stagnation, and financial commerce is following suit. In recent years, the profits of the industrial and commercial circles have been quite abundant, and their capital is strong. At the same time, in this decisive stage, not only can the above-mentioned reasons for the scale stagnation not be resolved temporarily, but there is also the possibility of repeated other wartime damages. Under the shifting of this situation, industrialists must not wait idly. In order to continue operating and lay the foundation for the future, they must seek a way to open up a way out.</p>
<p>Most of the industrial products in Shanghai are sold to the inland rural areas. Therefore, we advocate that the industrialists in Shanghai should immediately consider investing in various counties in the inland and establish small factories for various daily necessities. Utilize the local specialty raw materials. For example, Danyang County in Jiangsu Province produces glutinous rice, which can be used to set up an alcohol factory to extract alcohol. As for安置失业职工, alleviating the severity of social problems, it is especially important.</p>
<p>Our newspaper's February 24th editorial commented on industrial dispersion, and had already made some suggestions on the implementation of factory relocation. We believe that at this time, whether it is for the sake of the industrialists themselves or for the sake of the national economy, it is necessary to consider opening up a way out as soon as possible. Today's news reports the news that factories in various cities are relocating to Huaihai Province, which the Ministry is extremely concerned about. It is hoped that the competent authorities and people in the industrial sector will further discuss actively carrying out the method in order to realize it.</p>
<p>Factory Relocation Issue, Ministry of Industry and Commerce Researches Countermeasures; Governor Hao of Huaihai Province Expresses Welcome</p>
<p>Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Various civilian-use factories in Shanghai, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Bengbu and other places are currently in a state of shutdown due to the difficulty of raw materials and insufficient power. On the contrary, Huaihai Province, known for its abundant raw material resources and coal, also cannot smoothly transport its products to the areas where various factories need them. This kind of malformed phenomenon is all due to the inability to unblock transportation problems. At present, increasing production, stabilizing the people's livelihood, and then enhancing combat power have become urgent. Therefore, all parties concerned have attached great importance to this issue and hope to seek a reasonable solution. Some people advocate relocating factories in Shanghai and other places to the Huaihai area to continue production. In this regard, Governor Hao expressed his views when he went to Beijing a few days ago, and decided to give full assistance and welcome all factories to relocate as soon as possible. It is reported that the authorities of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce are also very concerned about this and are actively studying specific countermeasures in order to realize them as soon as possible, so as to revitalize the industry. A few days ago, they also sent personnel to Shanghai and other places to ask for the opinions of various factories for reference.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Troops Massing on the Border of Annam</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - News of Japanese troops searching for hostile forces in Vietnam has dealt a major blow to the Chongqing Anti-Japanese camp, and future trends are worth paying attention to.</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The 澮方's military operations approaching Annam along with material counterattacks are actively promoted, and its intentions are twofold: to cut off the north-south railway connecting mainland China and the south; to restore the blood transfusion route to Chiang Kai-shek's aid in Annam. Chongqing is also taking advantage of the weakness of Annam's military preparations, massing about ten divisions of troops on the Annam border to engage in threats. The power of France is also declining day by day. Chongqing has long coveted the rich resources of Annam, and is single-mindedly appeasing overseas Chinese in an attempt to squeeze their materials. In the future, its conspiracy will use preemptive means. As for Chongqing's attempt, the Japanese army will give a head-on blow. Therefore, all circles in Chongqing even speculate that the Japanese army's next strategy is to attack Kunming, and they are quite apprehensive.</p>

Almost all administrative talents can be selected at the same time. If the people of the country still want us to be in power after the next election, the government will gradually reform.</p>

<h3>In Order to Cope with the Decisive War, We Must Persist With Perseverance; Dr. Goebbels Publishes a Paper</h3>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The German News Agency reported that German Propaganda Minister Goebbels wrote in the national weekly that the main task of each war is to distinguish between strong and weak countries and enable the fittest to survive. A country that does not achieve success in wartime will have no possibility of further development, and the victor will gain more opportunities. In order to cope with this decisive period, we must persevere. If there are mistakes in the early stages of the war, they can still be remedied. Mistakes at the end of the war are irreparable. Both sides of the war are doing their best to engage in the final battle. Those who can disregard everything and fight for the most favorable peace will have the highest chance of winning.</p>

The American report that Chiang Kai-shek will attend the San Francisco conference is inaccurate, because the National Congress will be held in Chongqing on May 6, and Chiang must attend the meeting and cannot leave the country.</p>
<h3>Battle Situation of Japanese Garrison on Iwo Jima</h3>
<p>The continuous attacks on the Japanese mainland by the U.S. mobile force are a cover operation for the landing operations on Iwo Jima, which shows that the strategic value of Iwo Jima is extremely important in the enemy's view. For this small island, they did not hesitate to invest a large amount of steel, and after a fierce bombardment, the U.S. military began to land. What kind of island is this Iwo Jima in the midst of a fierce battle? How do the defenders on the island fight?</p>
<p>Not a Single Blade of Grass Grows</p>
<p>The circumference of Iwo Jima is only a little over ten kilometers, and unlike the Philippines, Taiwan, and Saipan, the entire island is sandy land formed by volcanic ash. The crater on the island still emits white smoke, and due to geothermal heat, the wind blowing from the sea immediately covers the entire island like hot air, giving people the feeling of being in a Turkish bath. Therefore, food is extremely easy to spoil, and storage is completely impossible. The drinking water on the island is, of course, filtered seawater, but it must be boiled before it can be used, so rainwater is also collected for drinking. When we first arrived on this island, we tried to dig a well and take water, and found hot springs near the crater. At that time, everyone was overjoyed and jumped down, but who knew that the whole body immediately seemed to be immersed in glue, similar to being greasy, and even the hair was knotted together. Because of the excessive salt content, this kind of hot spring is of no use at all, and as a result, no one has ever taken a bath to this day. Moreover, there are not many trees on the island. In addition to using geothermal heat, cooking and boiling can only be done by drying the unknown weeds on Yepeng Island and using them as fuel. Now, due to the bombing and fierce bombing by airplanes, the entire island has changed its appearance, and there is simply not a single blade of grass left. However, the morale of the entire Japanese garrison is still extremely high, and everyone is full of enthusiasm, as fiery as the flames of a volcano. The only things they eat daily are pickled plums and salted radishes. The vegetables planted in the open space have also failed to be harvested due to bombing. Moreover, around this "scorching hell," enemy submarines are often lurking to hinder supplies, and large enemy planes patrol the sky, closely monitoring Japanese actions. Therefore, whenever supply ships or planes pass through the enemy's cordon and arrive at Iwo Jima, the garrison is very happy and quickly unloads the cargo to prevent the valuable supplies from becoming victims of shells and bombs in vain.</p>
<p>The U.S. Military Spares No Expense</p>
<p>The U.S. military's bombing of this small island can be said to spare no expense. As for its air control method, the aircraft groups are generally divided into two echelons. If one echelon enters from an altitude of about 5,000 meters, the altitude of the other echelon must be 7-8,000 meters in order to unexpectedly attack the Japanese air defense forces. When reaching the airspace above the target, they drop bombs and strafe horizontally and vertically. There is simply no gap. The interval between the bomb craters is extremely small. The ash and sand dug up by one bomb often buries the large hole created by another bomb. By the time the U.S. planes retreat, the ground is like a raging sea with undulating waves. There are only countless sand dunes stretching endlessly, which is completely different from the scene after an air raid that we usually imagine. The invading enemy planes always come at 10:00 AM every day with about 30 Grumman, Consolidated, and B-29s. At night, there is often one or two B-29s flying at an altitude of about 4,000 meters to drop bombs.</p>
<p>The Japanese Military's Determination to Defend</p>
<p>In short, there is very little that can be used on Iwo Jima. When digging into the ground, seawater will gush out before too deep, so it is absolutely impossible to dig a satisfactory trench. And because of the geothermal heat, the wind blowing is unbearably hot, so you have to expose your whole body on the ground and fight the invading enemy. The hardship of the garrison can be said to be even greater than Guadalcanal. But the morale of the entire army is not weakened at all. The determination to defend Iwo Jima to the death is revealed on the pale faces of every soldier. (Special Correspondent Toda) (Translated from the February 21st Mainichi Shimbun)</p>
<h3>Fierce Street Fighting in Mandalay - Japanese Garrison Launches an Ambush - Major Victory on the Irrawaddy Line</h3>

However, on the 10th, the enemy troops, with tanks and armored vehicles as the vanguard, gradually began to invade the northern part of the city and engaged in fierce street fighting with the Japanese garrison. Especially in the Wangcheng area, the Japanese army strictly defended their strong positions. Since the 9th, fierce battles have continued all day long, repelling the enemy troops. Subsequently, on the 11th, the battles around the city gradually intensified. A part of the enemy forces, with five tanks, detoured and invaded the northern part of the city. After being ambushed by the Japanese army, they were given a great damage that afternoon and were repelled.

The positive and side aspects of the strict investigation, the results obtained should be reported to Chairman Zhou himself at any time.

<h3>Ministry of Finance Reviews Listed Stocks - Bans Over-the-Counter Trading - Strictly Enforces Regulations</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange was placed under the direct supervision and management of the Ministry of Finance, the original Supervisory Committee of the Exchange was abolished, and the Office of the Ministry of Finance's Shanghai Securities Exchange Supervisor was established, with Bi Zhishuo, Deputy Minister of Finance, still appointed as the Chief Supervisor. The office earnestly reviews the contents of the listed stock companies and supervises the trading activities of brokers in the market, and bans over-the-counter trading by brokers. A Central News Agency reporter recently learned from the Office of the Securities Exchange Supervisor that the office has decided to strictly review listed stocks in accordance with the Rules for Reviewing Listed Stocks on the Shanghai Securities Exchange. Where stocks lose the possibility of free trading, the company's content changes and does not match the original application for listing, the company's business is sluggish and the capital is depleted, and the stock market price falls below the par value, the exchange shall apply to the Supervisor's Office, or the office shall directly order the exchange to suspend or cancel its listing. If the company can remedy the situation in the shortest possible time, it can apply to the Supervisor's Office for verification and temporary exemption from suspension of trading or delisting, but in cases where the circumstances are serious and harm the public interest, no application may be made.</p>
<p>For the prohibition of over-the-counter trading, special regulations have been made for the temporary measures for brokers to handle transactions. If a broker has customers buying and selling the same type of stock at the same time, they may settle the transaction within the broker's firm in accordance with the regulations of the exchange. However, they should apply to the Supervisor's Office for approval in advance, submit the application to the Ministry of Finance for filing, and request the exchange to issue the prescribed vouchers and books. The type and amount of stocks handled by the broker, as well as the transaction taxes collected, should be listed and categorized to the Supervisor's Office and the exchange the next day. If a broker handles transactions without approval, they will be punished in accordance with the prohibition of over-the-counter trading and fined accordingly.</p>
<h3>Nanhui Adjusts its Organization</h3>

On the eighth day, the Japanese troops repeatedly set out from their positions, charging into the enemy's lines, attacking the enemy fiercely. The enemy's casualties exceeded three thousand, and several tanks were destroyed. A great deal of weapons and supplies were captured. According to enemy sources, an average of 250 wounded soldiers are transported daily from the Iwo Jima airfield to hospitals in Hawaii. Based on this figure, the extent of enemy casualties can be imagined. Therefore, according to enemy claims, the battle of Iwo Jima is the most brutal war in the Pacific. In the future, the Japanese troops will cause the enemy to bleed even more heavily, which the enemy cannot avoid.</p>
<p>Enemy Air Raids Ineffective</p>
<p>Recently, enemy American forces have continued to bomb the Japanese mainland, repeatedly bombing Tokyo, Nagoya, and Osaka on the 11th, 12th, and 14th. According to enemy sources, the total number of aircraft used in the raids exceeded five hundred. However, this kind of air raid can only damage a portion of civilian housing and has no effect on enhancing combat power. According to Japanese investigations, the number of aircraft attacking was 150 on the 10th, 130 on the 12th, and 140 on the 14th, gradually decreasing, totaling approximately 350. Of this number, 52 were shot down by Japanese troops, and 170 were damaged, totaling 222, which accounted for 63% of the total number. In other words, it equals two months of production of the enemy's B-29 type aircraft. The enemy claims that the air raids on the Japanese mainland have caused considerable losses to the Japanese side, but in fact, all major production facilities have already been relocated and evacuated. In Tokyo, only some civilian residences have been affected. Even if the enemy could turn Tokyo into ashes, it would still not be able to damage the necessary factories in the slightest. The result of the enemy's three air raids was the destruction of two months' worth of their own aircraft production. Therefore, the enemy will inevitably face many difficulties in future operations. Moreover, the Japanese people have suffered many natural disasters and major fires in the past, and they have become accustomed to it. The civilian population does not feel particularly difficult even if they lose some housing due to air raids. The enemy's proclaimed scorched-earth policy is of no help. The Japanese people do not feel it is serious. Instead, it gives ordinary people the opportunity to build new houses. Thank you Americans, especially President Roosevelt.</p>
<p>American Troops in the Philippines Unable to Move</p>
<p>In the Philippines, fierce fighting is taking place in the mountainous areas east of Manila, such as Batayan and Montalban, as well as in Zamboanga in Mindanao. The Montalban mountainous areas of Luzon Island are particularly fierce, and a major battle may be triggered. Regardless of how the battle is fought, the Japanese side's greatest objective is to make the enemy bleed. The Japanese troops are engaged in the war with a consistent style. The twenty divisions of troops deployed by the enemy have already been bogged down. The Japanese troops are containing their forces, making it impossible for them to move and preventing them from engaging in the second phase of the operation.</p>
<p>Opportunity to Annihilate Enemy Fleet is Near</p>
<p>Regarding the movements of the enemy fleet in the Marianas, this is also something that we urgently want to know. Their air raids on Taiwan and Okinawa are also related to this battle situation. The Japanese side is paying close attention to this in the battle situation. Last time, Minister of the Navy Yonai stated at a cabinet meeting that the best opportunity to annihilate the enemy was about to arrive, which has great significance. The results achieved by the Japanese Kamikaze attack teams in the Battle of Peleliu are a prelude to annihilating the enemy. Therefore, reducing the enemy is near.</p>
<p>Anglo-American Fleets Unable to Cooperate</p>
<p>The contradictions and internal friction between the Anglo-American fleets in the Pacific are becoming increasingly evident. Recently, London and New York have often issued statements regarding the future movements of the British fleet, especially statements by Nimitz and Halsey. Based on the statements of these two, we feel that a great mystery is hidden between the British and American navies. Extrapolating, it can be said that the British fleet is weak, the British fleet's actions are passive, and the United States is unwilling to provide the British fleet with bases. Under these kinds of hidden reefs, how the Anglo-American Pacific fleets will unfold their situation in the future is an extremely interesting question. We assert that the result is that the United States has the ambition to dominate the Pacific after the war. On the one hand, Britain wants to protect its original maritime interests, and on the other hand, it does not care that its fleet will be damaged in combat. With these kinds of contradictory phenomena between the British and Americans, can they cooperate in the war? Based on this point, it can be seen that Anglo-American operations are not for their own interests but a struggle for interests. Thinking about the future of Greater East Asia, what will the future be like if the enemy lands, extends its claws, and realizes the struggle for interests? Therefore, we must strive to annihilate the enemy.</p>
