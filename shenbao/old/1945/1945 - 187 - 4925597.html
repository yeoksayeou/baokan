<h3>太平洋戰事長期化敵美戰略受挫　軍事評論家論敵美企圖</h3>
<p>本市某軍事評論家，頃就敵人今後之作戰企圖，發表談話如下：</p>
<p>敵美戰法陷於停頓</p>
<p>敵人於開始反攻作戰後，最活躍而顯著者，當推尼米資之戰法。但自冲繩島作戰完畢後，今已入停頓之踏步狀態。冲繩敵軍遭受日特攻隊猛攻，受創極重，敵方現雖巳在補充修理中，但距新作戰艦隊之需要程度尙遠，故最近出現於西南諸島者，僅有小規模之機動部隊，大規模之作戰，刻尙未能實現也。尤其爲陸上作戰，敵遭受空前之大損失，招致國內各方面之非難，而有陸上作戰應由陸軍担任之說。敵人所誇口之跳島作戰法，現亦未能快跳而改變其作風爲步步作戰法矣。另一方面麥克沃塞之基地推進作戰法，原擬由菲島經由中國大陸，侵略東南亞細亞，現則轉向婆羅洲，正與日軍戰鬥中。敵人此種舉動與原因，一由於美軍動員不能如所希望者實現，二由於渝軍之未能迅速改變爲現代化的兵力，故在歐洲兵力，未能移向太平洋前。只得先行培養戰力攫取資源而已。</p>
<p>補給運輸能力低微</p>
<p>美軍數千里外作戰，其補充上之需要，無論補給艦隊運輸船隻，能力必極低微。今後欲期長期作戰，必須有自給自足辦法，故最近似又移其目光於南方之資源，而使之戰力化。敵人以移動歐洲乓力東來，須要相當時期，在未能完成下期作戰兵力集中前，乃從事於準備工作之進行。譬如麥克沃塞任命尼米資部下太平洋地域司令部美路均部隊司令官陸軍中將李却生爲中部太平洋地域美陸軍部隊司令官，即其一例也。又如麥克沃塞指揮下之第七艦隊，原在荷印作戰者，其司令官金凱脫，近向新聞記者宣稱第七艦隊日後將歸尼米資將軍指揮，故今後在相當時期中，陸海軍將全部參加對日作戰。</p>
<p>對日戰爭將長期化</p>
<p>過去尼米資與麥克沃塞爲兩個戰法，今後其趨勢將合而爲一，海陸兩方面由海陸軍分任之。在歐洲兵力未能完成移動及補給路綫未能充實前，暫時作戰，僅爲其準備工作之一，不能有若何顯著之活動。美國本來希望短期決戰，今事與願背，乃不得不從事於長期作戰，故特魯曼總統要求在十個月之內，必須完成歐洲兵力之移動。蔣介石最近接見新聞記者時亦稱，對日戰爭至少尙須要十八個月時期。又美國戰時動員局局長文生氏云，我們雖努力於戰事之得以早日解決，但亦須考慮到戰事之長期化及生產方面之情形，凡此云云，均堪玩味耳。</p>
<p>空軍攻勢必將展開</p>
<p>日本根據以上諸點，無論在軍在政，未來之決戰，尙在半年或一載之後。在此準備期中，日木本土必能成爲要塞化，全國國民完成武裝化，培養最後勝利之戰略。但在此一年中，我人亦有不可輕視者，即敵人在戰略上轟炸，必愈積極也。敵馬利亞那島二十轟炸隊之阿諾德功勞，及侵佔沖繩之第八航空隊之杜立德攻勢，將來對日木各都市或軍事生產工業地帶之破壞，及海外其他各地之轟炸，均在日本洞燭之中。在大作戰未完成前，此兩個攻勢，必將展開，但日本則早有　備矣。又在杜立德指揮下空軍29型機，已形增加，凡從前不在轟炸範圍之地區，如滿洲。朝鮮，華北等，嗣後勢亦將被劃入轟炸圈內。惟敵人僅賴空戰，決難獲得勝利，尤其爲日本國民，士氣旺盛，團結一致，對敵轟炸毫不畏懼。</p>
<p>日本土完成要塞化</p>
<p>日本本土之要塞化，係根據過去硫黃冲繩等島之教訓而完成者，係絕對不能擊破之堅強要塞。據說日本某一地下工廠，每月能生產飛機數百架，可知日本之飛機生產量，前途殊為光明。敵人轟炸何足爲懼，日本必能完成必勝戰力之生產，把握最後之勝利，尤其日本國民充滿以一殺十之特攻精神，確信最後勝利，必歸日本。</p>
<h3>美羅巴茲上校　在沖繩陣亡</h3>
<p>里斯本五日中央社電據紐約電稱，美國第十軍司令官巴克那，會於六月十八日在冲繩本島陣亡。又據美聯社從軍記者之報道，同日美海軍第六師團第二十二聯隊長　巴茲上校，亦於該地陣亡，該記者報吿如次；羅巴茲因救援困於日軍砲火不能前進之美海軍，爲探求可通戰車之道路，而歸抵監視所後，眺望其附近有一具燒焦之兵士屍體，乃即前進，尙未達五十呎，突然一彈飛來，射穿該上校之胸部，該彈係由日軍伏兵所發。</p>
<h3>海豹敷香兩島　遭潛艦炮擊</h3>
<p>扎幌五日中央社電二日上午五時半，在海豹島西方，有敵濳水艦一艘出現，斷續對該島砲擊及以機槍掃射者三次。又三日上午一時四十分，敵潛水艦一艘於敷香近海出現，對扎幌內川河口附近，徐發數炮，旋即這走，日方無損害。</p>

<h3>爪哇展開　新國民運動</h3>

<h3>粵淮兩省府　革新機構</h3>
<p>廣州五日中央社電本省為遵照中央修正行政機構改革方案之規定，經於一日將政務　撤銷，另設立民政　及秘書處，業已開始辦公。</p>
<p>徐州五日中央社電淮海省政府爲適應決戰體制，亟謀調整人事，革新機構，自奉中　刷新地方政治，實施行政簡素化之命令後，業於五月一日正式將政務廳改組，分爲民政廳及秘書處，人事亦已決定，幷將調整各區實員及縣長。又爲安定公務員生活計，自本月起，裁汰冗員四分之一。</p>
<p>徐州五日中央社電淮海省當局，前爲輔助建設工作，乃有政治工作團之設置，由郝省長兼任團長，第一區專員兼任副團長，現爲强化工作效能，特調整人事，派祖國華爲團長，劉捷爲副團長，幷將工作重點於鐵路沿線，以確保交通綫之安全，祖。劉兩氏已於一日正式視事。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>日本的決戰政治與非當立法</h3>
<p>日本正站在本土決戰的關頭，日木政治的體制也由於戰時緊急措置法的實施，已經充分的具備決戰的機能。我們要認識日本決戰政治的特質，非從戰時緊急措置法的分析出發不可。</p>
<p>在上月初旬的臨時議會裏，鈴木內閣以最大的決心，提出了。時緊急措置法的方案。因爲戰時緊急措置法的目標，是政洽部面全體的刷新，是政府力量充分的集中。而戰時緊急措置法所以不能不提出，有下列幾個原因。</p>
<p>第一，那冲繩的戰局已經非常急迫，冲繩的決戰是日本本土大決戰的前哨。爲迅速完成本土防衛的體制，不能不實施戰時緊急措置，採取最簡捷最有效的辦法。</p>
<p>第二，日木近年來實行統制經濟，法令層出不窮，頗感疊床架屋之弊。今日爲速決速行，適應決戰形勢計，不能不有超過現存的法律，命令與慣習效力，而臨機應變，果敢斷行的。現在吏就其立法的特質加以剖視。</p>
<p>第一，過去日本的種種統制法令都以國家總動員法爲基礎，遇必要時，用勅令的制定方式來立法，可是這次戰時緊急措置法不受這種限定，不問以往有否其他規定，只嬰發必要的命令，就可處分。就是閣令，省令（部令）都可以做到。况且將來日本行政機構必然以中央爲企劃，同時以地方爲實踐的機關，所以在中央讓其權限之一部於地方之後，就是將來作戰時交通雖被切斷，而地方自洽之機能可以强化。</p>
<p>第二，內容包括：　軍需生產之維持及增强，　食糧及其他生活必需物資之確保，　運輸通行之維持及增强，　防衛之强化及秩序之維持，　稅制之適正化，　戰災之善後拈置，　其他戰力之集中發揮必要事項以勅令指定者，可以說徧及國民生活的全部，所以就是形式上並非常大權的發動，却是得議會協贊的立法，但實際上，政府可以待奏請非常大權的發動，而因此得以發揮其巨大的政治力量。</p>
<p>第三，緊急措置之重要者，政府以勅令之規定，諮聞於戰時緊急措置委員會。該委員會大抵由貴族院衆　院的少數議員所構成，因此雖然由政府全權辦理，可是與國民代表之間，仍舊保持相常聯繫。</p>
<p>總之，日本在本土決戰的關頭，決戰的政洽體制不能不迅迎確立，戰時緊急措置法便是日本決戰政治的高度的發動機。在冲繩日軍施行最後攻擊後，雖然一時戰局表面比較沉靜，然而緊急的程度正與日俱增。日木決戰政治的體制，我們從這次非常立法的大概看來，可以知道現在已經有全體的刷新，政府的力量也已經充分的集中。日本政府與國民的戰意，將使日本本土造成堅强的要塞。</p>
<h3>淸積弊裕省庫浙整頓稅收工商業公會舉辦登記</h3>
<p>杭州五日中央社電丁省長鑒於本省財政向以各地方稅及消費特稅爲重要稅源，乃近年以來各地方對於繳納稅款負擔旣重，而省庫收入仍未見充裕，其中難免有舞弊及巾飽等情事，爲切實整頓起見，除將各地稅局負責人員嚴加調整外，並力事肅淸積弊，務期不增加人民負擔，而得充裕省庫收入。至於各周徵收稅額，於本年七月份起一律提高，幷通令各縣縣畏兼保安大隊長，對省庫收入盡力協助，幷轉飭各該縣商會，嚴禁商民偸漏。今後省府考核各縣縣長，保安隊隊長及警察局長成績，將其對省稅徵收之是否竭誠協力，列爲重要項目之一。</p>
<p>杭州五日中央社電浙省府建設廳以政府自參戰後即實施戰時經濟統制政策，而各同業公會即爲推進此項政策之基本機構，茲爲健全各該公會組織，以謀工商業進展，幷爲明瞭各地工商情形，特舉辦全省工商業公會登記，傳得積極整頓，期待市縣工商業公會漸可步入正軌，今後社會經濟當可日趨安定。茲爲各市縣工商業公會便利申請登記，依法領取執照起見，特　定申請書格式，檢發市縣政府，　飭各地照辦。</p>
<h3>陳皋返京談視察感想</h3>

<p>瑞典京城五日中央社電　倫敦來電，英外部五日發表謂，外相艾登前會患病，然近已　　，當可出席三頭會談。</p>
<p>舊國際聯盟會二三月解散</p>
<p>瑞典京城五日中央社電據倫敦方面引紐約時報消息稱：舊國際聯盟會，自一九三九年召集最後一次會議後，茲復將于最近之二三月中，在日內瓦舉行解散儀式，蓋目前新國際聯盟雖稱已吿成立，然各項複雜之立法。行政及政務上之一切手續，尙未急切實施，故舊聯盟不得不遲遲結東，現各界均深盼在此最短期內，新舊國際聯盟機構能同時工作，而對新聯盟予以更大發展，蓋新聯盟所担任之各項工作，均極少涉及聯盟會中之政治工作。目前有二件情事，頗使舊聯盟召開會議時不得不加以注意，即　會議中將提出要求，贊同舊國際聯盟之監察委員會在戰爭時所進行之各項工作及活動。　會議中將遺派委員會人員與新國際聯盟之代表人員商討各項工作移交事宜，然於此情形之下，將有二大難問題發生。第一項，舊聯盟委員會所有之一切工作中，曾包括多至二百與三百件條約，此項條約內之規定，係由聯盟機構所執行者。又此項條約有涉及國際聯盟之名稱者，然舊國聯之名稱易爲新聯合國機構之名稱，頗爲一簡易之更迭，故此項條約問題將由聯合國中國際法專家開會詳加討論之。同時關于結東舊國聯之委托統治制一項，亦需有一合法手絨，新國際聯盟將以新方式替代之。再國際勞工室之地位應予決定，新國際法庭旣已成立，則對舊國際法庭如何予以正式解散。第二項嚴重問題，乃如何處置舊國聯所有在日內瓦之大部生財資產，蘇聯曾反對將新國際機構設於日內瓦，但此項問題並未經舊金山會議中詳加討　。</p>
<p>浙物資管理處增加土產管理</p>
<p>杭州五日中央社電本省土產物資，素稱豐富，行銷東南各省，　及華北地帶，數字驚人，殊爲浙省財源之大宗。事變以後，因交通關係，其物資流通巳不如昔日之圓滑，丁省長就職以來，對此項物資流動深切關懷。爲開發浙省資源，獎勵浙省土產物資，運銷各地起見，除已將土紙，茶葉，綢類，主烟，土酒六種物資，劃歸浙省士產物資管理處，以便商民運銷外，自六月六日起又將藥磁，山貨，草蔴，劃歸該管理處。且悉於七月一日起，復將與軍用有密切關係之油脂類及共原料以及非鐵金屬，竹木，薪炭，　肉類，蔬菜類等各種物資，亦由土產物資管理處管理，手續簡單，將予商人以極大之便利。</p>

<h3>西姆拉會議延期鮑思向國內廣播</h3>
<p>昭南五日中央社電　自由印度臨時政府主席鮑斯，頃就西姆拉會談決定延期事，特向印度國內廣播，其要旨如次：　印度各派於西姆拉會議中，曾竭力避免立時解決，而採取延期決定方針，實際表面之舉，印度國民於此期間內，可有充分時間判斷英國目的所在。同時，更可消滅邱吉爾等保守黨於五日總選舉時利用英。印妥協方案，今後印方可以有利之立塲與英國折衝。　甘地翁未參加西姆拉會議，實為上策，然危險期尚未度過。據言　會對合衆社記者申述謂：「余深望西姆拉會議成功，並能解決問題」云。余望翁之「解決」二字，其意義非謂對英屈服。　會議派內，似有永　英於回教聯盟不能妥協，則應總督居中斡旋者，然決不能使英帝國主義最高權威者總督居中　旋，蓋此種措置乃印人決不能容忍之暴舉。　吾人須注視回敎聯盟之態度，琴那於會見記者時曾謂，彼等所欲承　華維爾提案。係因使印度分離有實現可能，吾人常認淸督與同敎聯盟成一氣，壓迫會議派之一種陰險手段。</p>

<h3>Intense Battle at Balikpapan: Japanese Troops Employ Melee Attacks, Fierce Fighting Continues in the Miri Jungles</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Southern Front Base, 5th. American and Australian forces have landed at Balikpapan. Under the cover of intense naval bombardment and aerial bombing, they attempt to expand their beachhead and actively dispatch reinforcements to land. The Japanese garrison responds with accurate artillery fire, inflicting heavy damage. Simultaneously, they engage the enemy's powerful mechanized units, spearheaded by three heavy tanks and sixty light tanks, attempting to breach the Japanese first line of defense. Japanese troops bravely employ melee attacks. At one point, enemy forces manage to penetrate part of the defensive line, but through valiant Japanese fighting, the main enemy force is repelled by evening. The enemy, fearing Japanese night raids, retreats at night, avoiding a decisive battle with Japanese forces.</p>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Southern Front Base, 5th. Japanese troops in the Miri area are currently deploying strong defensive positions in the dense jungle and continuing to fight fiercely. Since the enemy landed on the 20th of last month, a portion of Japanese forces engaged in a minor skirmish with the enemy north of Miri on the 3rd, but no large-scale battle developed. During this time, the enemy gradually increased their strength, with some forces moving south along Miri. Simultaneously, other forces began moving north. On the 28th, near the 　崗 area, having passed through Seria from Brunei, they appear to have established contact with the southern advance force.</p>

<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Nanjing, 5th. The Ministry of Finance, regarding the supervision and command of the insurance industry, after the industry department of the ministry took over the exclusive management, the original Insurance Supervision Bureau under the ministry was abolished. All matters related to insurance registration, etc., are handled directly by the ministry. The inspection matters are entrusted to the Central Reserve Bank, which establishes an office to inspect insurance affairs. Now that the competent authority for the insurance industry has been changed, the articles of the Insurance Law Enforcement Regulations promulgated by the National Government should be amended accordingly. In addition, the Insurance Registration Rules, etc., promulgated by the Ministry of Industry, are also to be separately formulated by the Ministry of Finance, taking into account the current situation, drafting the principles of the Insurance Law and Enforcement Amendment Law, as well as the draft Insurance Registration Rules, etc., and submitting them to the 149th meeting of the Central Political Council through the Executive Yuan for approval, and then submitting them to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation, and promulgating them separately after deliberation.</p>

However, since this proposal could not be promulgated in time, and the adjustment of postal surcharges and employee benefits was urgent, it was proposed to increase domestic and international postage rates by seven times uniformly, effective from July 1st, and submitted by the Ministry of Construction to the Executive Yuan and then to the Central Political Council, which was passed at the 149th meeting on the 5th.</p>
<h3>Japanese Major General Ueda Appointed Director of the Imperial Headquarters Information Department, Major General Matsumura Transferred to Important Position</h3>

The Japanese Cabinet announced on the 5th that Major General Shuitsu Matsumura, Director of the First Department of the Information Bureau, has been transferred to an important position. His vacancy will be filled by Major General Masao Ueda of the Army.</p>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Tokyo, 5th. The change of the Director of the Imperial Headquarters Information Department was announced by the Japanese Army Ministry on the 5th. The former Director, Major General Shuitsu Matsumura, has been transferred to Chief of Staff of the Chinese Military Officer Area. The new Director, Major General Masao Ueda, is from Tokushima Prefecture, graduated from the Army War College, and has served as staff officer of the Kwantung Army, military attaché to Poland, and chief of the Defense Section of the Army Ministry.</p>
<h3>Protracted Pacific War: Enemy American Strategy Frustrated, Military Commentator Discusses Enemy American Intentions</h3>
<p>A certain military commentator in this city recently made the following statement regarding the enemy's future operational intentions:</p>
<p>Enemy American Tactics Stalled</p>
<p>After the enemy began their counteroffensive, the most active and prominent tactic was that of Nimitz. However, since the end of the Battle of Okinawa, it has entered a state of stagnation. The enemy forces in Okinawa suffered heavy damage from Japanese kamikaze attacks. Although the enemy is currently replenishing and repairing, it is still far from meeting the needs of a new operational fleet. Therefore, only small-scale mobile units have recently appeared in the Southwest Islands. A large-scale operation has not yet been realized. Especially for land operations, the enemy suffered unprecedented losses, resulting in criticism from various domestic quarters, and the argument that land operations should be undertaken by the Army. The enemy's boasted island-hopping strategy has also failed to hop quickly and has changed its approach to a step-by-step approach. On the other hand, MacArthur's base-advancing operational method, originally intended to invade Southeast Asia via the Philippines and the Chinese mainland, has now turned to Borneo and is currently fighting the Japanese army. The reasons for this move by the enemy are: first, the American mobilization has not been realized as hoped; second, the Chongqing army has failed to rapidly transform into a modern force. Therefore, before the European forces can be shifted to the Pacific, they must first cultivate combat power and seize resources.</p>
<p>Low Supply and Transportation Capacity</p>
<p>The American army, operating thousands of miles away, must have very low capacity in terms of the supply ships and transport ships required for replenishment. In the future, if they want to conduct long-term operations, they must have a self-sufficiency method. Therefore, they recently seem to have shifted their focus to the resources of the South, and are turning them into combat power. The enemy needs a considerable period of time to move European forces to the East. Before completing the concentration of forces for the next phase of operations, they are engaged in preparation work. For example, MacArthur appointed Lieutenant General Lichey, commander of the US Army forces in the Central Pacific region under Nimitz's Pacific area command, which is one example. Also, Admiral Kincaid, commander of the Seventh Fleet under MacArthur's command, which was originally operating in the Dutch East Indies, recently declared to reporters that the Seventh Fleet will be under the command of General Nimitz in the future. Therefore, the Army and Navy will fully participate in operations against Japan in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>War Against Japan Will Be Protracted</p>
<p>In the past, Nimitz and MacArthur had two different strategies. In the future, the trend will be to merge them into one, with the Army and Navy taking charge of the sea and land respectively. Before the movement of European forces is completed and the supply lines are not fully established, the temporary operations are only part of the preparatory work and cannot have any significant activity. The United States originally hoped for a short-term decisive battle. Now that things have gone against their wishes, they have no choice but to engage in long-term operations. Therefore, President Truman requested that the movement of European forces be completed within ten months. Chiang Kai-shek also recently told reporters that the war against Japan will require at least eighteen months. Moreover, Vincent, Director of the US War Mobilization Bureau, said, "Although we are working hard to resolve the war as soon as possible, we must also consider the protracted nature of the war and the production situation." All these statements are worthy of contemplation.</p>
<p>Air Offensive Will Inevitably Unfold</p>
<p>Based on the above points, whether in the military or political sphere, Japan believes that the future decisive battle is still half a year or a year away. During this preparation period, the Japanese mainland will definitely become a fortress, and the entire population will be armed, cultivating a strategy for final victory. However, there are also things that we cannot underestimate in this year, that is, the enemy's strategic bombing will inevitably become more active. The exploits of Arnold's 20th Bomber Command in the Mariana Islands, and Doolittle's offensive of the Eighth Air Force, which occupied Okinawa, and the future destruction of Japanese cities or military production industrial areas, and the bombing of other places overseas, are all within Japan's understanding. Before the major operation is completed, these two offensives will inevitably unfold, but Japan is already prepared. Also, the number of Type 29 aircraft in the Air Force under Doolittle's command has increased. Areas that were not previously within the bombing range, such as Manchuria, Korea, and North China, will also be included in the bombing range in the future. However, the enemy cannot win by relying solely on air combat. Especially for the Japanese people, morale is high and unity is strong, and they are not afraid of enemy bombing at all.</p>
<p>Japanese Mainland Completed Fortress</p>
<p>The fortification of the Japanese mainland is based on the lessons learned from the islands of Iwo Jima and Okinawa in the past and is a strong fortress that cannot be broken. It is said that a certain underground factory in Japan can produce hundreds of aircraft per month. It can be seen that Japan's aircraft production is very promising. What is there to fear from enemy bombing? Japan will definitely be able to complete the production of invincible combat power and seize the final victory. Especially the Japanese people are full of the spirit of special attack to kill ten enemies with one, and firmly believe that the final victory will belong to Japan.</p>
<h3>Colonel Robarts Dies in Okinawa</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Lisbon, 5th. According to a New York dispatch, General Buckner, commander of the US Tenth Army, died on Okinawa Island on June 18th. According to a report from an embedded Associated Press reporter, Colonel Robarts, commander of the 22nd Regiment of the US Marine Corps' Sixth Division, also died there on the same day. The reporter reported as follows: Robarts, in order to rescue US Marines trapped and unable to advance due to Japanese artillery fire, went to a monitoring post to seek a road passable for tanks. After arriving at the post, he saw a charred soldier's body nearby and immediately advanced. Before reaching fifty feet, a bullet suddenly flew and pierced the Colonel's chest. The bullet was fired by Japanese soldiers in ambush.</p>
<h3>Sea Lion and Shikuka Islands Shelled by Submarines</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Sapporo, 5th. At 5:30 AM on the 2nd, an enemy submarine appeared west of Sea Lion Island and intermittently shelled the island and strafed it with machine guns three times. Also, at 1:40 AM on the 3rd, an enemy submarine appeared off the coast of Shikuka and fired several shots near the mouth of the Shoro River in Sapporo, before quickly fleeing. There was no damage on the Japanese side.</p>
<h3>Ibaraki and Chiba Air Raided Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Dongzhou, 5th. About 100 Type 51 aircraft led by nine Type 29 aircraft gradually infiltrated the mainland from the vicinity of Mito and Kashimanada around 11:00 AM on the 5th. After attacking the airfields in Ibaraki and Chiba prefectures, they escaped from Kashima and Kujukuri Beach around noon.</p>
<h3>New National Movement Unfolds in Java</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Jakarta, 5th. The 4 million soldiers and civilians of Java, who are now advancing towards the establishment of Indonesia, are showing increasingly strong enthusiasm for defending their homeland and awareness of independence despite the fierce war situation. Recently, they launched a general mobilization movement, which has gradually become concrete and is scheduled to begin on the 8th of this month. In addition, according to the demands of the residents of Indonesia, a new national movement will be strongly promoted throughout the island. Before launching the movement, four people, including Sukarno, will be responsible for establishing a preparatory committee, which is scheduled to be ready by mid-July.</p>
<h3>Guangdong and Huaihai Provincial Governments Reform Institutions</h3>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Japan's Decisive Battle Politics and Extraordinary Legislation</h3>
<p>Japan is standing at the juncture of the decisive battle on the mainland. The structure of Japanese politics, due to the implementation of the Wartime Emergency Measures Law, is fully equipped with the function of the decisive battle. To understand the characteristics of Japan's decisive battle politics, it is necessary to start with an analysis of the Wartime Emergency Measures Law.</p>
<p>In the extraordinary Diet session at the beginning of last month, the Suzuki Cabinet proposed the Wartime Emergency Measures Law with the greatest determination. Because the goal of the Wartime Emergency Measures Law is the overall renewal of the political realm, and the full concentration of government power. The Wartime Emergency Measures Law had to be proposed for the following reasons.</p>
<p>First, the Okinawa battle situation has become extremely urgent. The decisive battle of Okinawa is the prelude to the great decisive battle on the Japanese mainland. In order to quickly complete the mainland defense system, it is necessary to implement wartime emergency measures and take the most concise and effective methods.</p>
<p>Second, Japan has been implementing a controlled economy in recent years, and numerous laws and regulations have emerged, causing the problem of overlapping and redundant structures. Today, for the sake of quick decision-making and action, and to adapt to the decisive battle situation, it is necessary to exceed the power of existing laws, orders, and customs, and to act decisively and flexibly. Now, let's examine its legislative characteristics.</p>
<p>First, past Japanese control laws were based on the National Mobilization Law. When necessary, they were legislated by issuing imperial ordinances. However, this Wartime Emergency Measures Law is not subject to this limitation. Regardless of whether there are other regulations in the past, as long as the necessary orders are issued, they can be disposed of. Even cabinet orders and ministerial orders can be issued. Moreover, in the future, the Japanese administrative structure will inevitably be based on central planning and local implementation. Therefore, after the central government cedes part of its authority to the local governments, even if transportation is cut off during future battles, the local self-government function can be strengthened.</p>
<p>Second, the content includes: 1. Maintaining and increasing military production; 2. Securing food and other essential supplies; 3. Maintaining and enhancing transportation and traffic; 4. Strengthening defense and maintaining order; 5. Appropriateness of the tax system; 6. Post-war placement of war disasters; 7. Those designated by imperial ordinance as necessary matters for the concentration and development of other combat capabilities can be said to encompass the entire national life. Therefore, even if it is not a very powerful activation in form, it is legislation supported by the Diet, but in reality, the government can wait for the activation of extremely great power upon request, and thus be able to exert its enormous political power.</p>
<p>Third, for important emergency measures, the government, by imperial ordinance, consults the Wartime Emergency Measures Committee. The committee is generally composed of a small number of members of the House of Peers and the House of Representatives. Therefore, although it is handled by the government with full authority, it still maintains considerable contact with the people's representatives.</p>
<p>In short, Japan is at the juncture of the decisive battle on the mainland, and the political system of the decisive battle must be quickly established. The Wartime Emergency Measures Law is the high-level engine of Japan's decisive battle politics. After the Japanese army launched the final attack in Okinawa, although the surface of the battle situation was relatively calm for a time, the degree of emergency was increasing day by day. From the outline of this extraordinary legislation, we can see that the Japanese political structure has been completely renewed, and the power of the government has been fully concentrated. The Japanese government and the national will to fight will make the Japanese mainland a strong fortress.</p>
<h3>Clearing Corruption and Increasing Revenue, Zhejiang Rectifies Tax Collection, Industry and Commerce Associations Conduct Registration</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Hangzhou, 5th. Governor Ding believes that local taxes and special consumption taxes have always been important sources of revenue in this province. However, in recent years, the burden of tax payment for local governments has been heavy, but the revenue of the provincial treasury has not increased significantly. It is inevitable that there have been corrupt and opportunistic events. In order to effectively rectify this situation, in addition to strictly adjusting the responsible personnel of local tax bureaus, he is also making efforts to eliminate corruption and ensure that the burden on the people is not increased, and the revenue of the provincial treasury is increased. As for the tax amount collected each week, it will be increased uniformly from July of this year, and all county magistrates and concurrently security brigade commanders are ordered to assist in the provincial treasury revenue as much as possible, and to instruct the chambers of commerce in each county to strictly prohibit merchants and people from evading taxes. In the future, the performance of county magistrates, security brigade commanders, and police chiefs will be assessed by the provincial government, and whether they have sincerely cooperated in the collection of provincial taxes will be listed as one of the important items.</p>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Hangzhou, 5th. The Zhejiang Provincial Government's Construction Department believes that the government has implemented wartime economic control policies since participating in the war, and various trade associations are the basic institutions for promoting this policy. In order to improve the organization of these associations, to promote the development of industry and commerce, and to understand the industrial and commercial situation in various places, a registration of industrial and commercial associations throughout the province is being conducted. It is expected that through active rectification, the industrial and commercial associations in cities and counties can gradually get on the right track, and the social economy can become more stable in the future. In order to facilitate the application for registration and legally obtain licenses for industrial and commercial associations in various cities and counties, a specific application form format has been specified and sent to the municipal and county governments, instructing them to follow suit.</p>
<h3>Chen Gao Returns to Nanjing to Discuss Inspection Impressions</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Nanjing, 5th. Chen Gao, commander of the Central Military Police, previously went to Wuhu, Bengbu, Hangzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Zhenjiang, and other places to inspect the service conditions of military police in various places in order to understand the local military police service situation. He has now returned to Nanjing after completing his official duties. The reporter specially visited him on the 5th and asked about his impressions of this trip. He said as follows: In recent times, the situation has become increasingly serious, and ensuring local security is a top priority. The responsibilities of military police in various places are particularly important. I am responsible for the military police supervision mission, and recently went to Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui and other places to inspect the service situation of the military police under my command, and to urge their work efficiency. The impression of this trip was quite good. The military police in various places are able to fulfill their responsibilities. In the future, I will further strengthen the military police institutions throughout the country to ensure local security and serve the country and the people.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Farm Bombed</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Guangzhou, 5th. At 11:30 AM on the 3rd, three enemy aircraft infiltrated from the northeast and dropped sixteen bombs on the Shipai Gongzhen Farm in this city. In addition to the destruction of the farm's water tower, two Gongzhen team members were killed and eight were seriously injured.

<h3>Truman and Churchill to Go to Berlin Soon; Pence and Eden Will Also Attend</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to a Washington dispatch: The date of the Three-Power Conference has been hinted at in a speech by the new U.S. Secretary of State, Pence, who stated: "In the very near future, I will accompany President Truman to Berlin to participate in the Three-Power talks." A rumor from the Hendaye area on the Spanish-French border states that British Prime Minister Churchill will leave London by plane next Tuesday with his wife and daughters for Bordaos.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 5th (Central News Agency Telegram) – A dispatch from London states that the British Foreign Office announced on the 5th that Foreign Secretary Eden had been ill previously, but has recently recovered and will be able to attend the Three-Power Conference.</p>
<p>The Old League of Nations to Dissolve in February or March</p>
<p>Stockholm, 5th (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to the *New York Times*, since convening for its last meeting in 1939, the Old League of Nations will hold a dissolution ceremony in Geneva in February or March. Although the new international organization claims to be established, complex legislative, administrative, and political procedures have not been implemented urgently. Therefore, the Old League must be dissolved. It is hoped that the new and old international organizations can work simultaneously in the shortest possible time and give greater development to the New League. The work undertaken by the New League rarely involves political work within the League. Currently, there are two matters that require attention during the Old League's meeting: first, the meeting will propose a request to endorse the work and activities carried out by the Supervisory Committee of the Old League of Nations during the war. Second, the meeting will send committee members to discuss work handover matters with representatives of the New League of Nations. Under these circumstances, two major difficult problems will arise. The first is that all the work of the Old League's committee includes as many as two to three hundred treaties, and the provisions in these treaties are executed by the League's organization. Some of these treaties involve the name of the League of Nations. However, changing the name of the Old League to the New United Nations organization is a simple change, so the issue of these treaties will be discussed in detail by international law experts in the United Nations. At the same time, a legal procedure is also required to conclude the trusteeship system of the Old League of Nations, and the New International League will replace it with a new method. Furthermore, the status of the International Labor Office should be determined, and since the new International Court of Justice has been established, how should the old International Court of Justice be formally dissolved? The second serious problem is how to dispose of the majority of the Old League of Nations' assets in Geneva. The Soviet Union opposed establishing the new international organization in Geneva, but this issue was not discussed in detail at the San Francisco Conference.</p>
<p>Zhejiang Materials Management Office Increases Management of Local Products</p>
<p>Hangzhou, 5th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The province's local products and materials are known to be abundant, sold to the southeastern provinces and northern China, with staggering figures, making them a major source of wealth for Zhejiang Province. Since the incident, due to transportation, the circulation of these materials has not been as smooth as in the past. Since Governor Ding took office, he has deeply cared about the flow of these materials. In order to develop Zhejiang's resources and encourage the transportation and sales of Zhejiang's local products and materials to various places, in addition to designating six types of materials – local paper, tea, silk, flue-cured tobacco, and local wine – to be managed by the Zhejiang Local Products and Materials Management Office to facilitate transportation and sales by merchants, starting from June 6th, medicine, porcelain, mountain goods, and ramie will also be placed under the management of the office. It is also learned that starting from July 1st, various materials closely related to military use, such as oils and fats and their raw materials, as well as non-ferrous metals, bamboo, wood, firewood, charcoal, meat, and vegetables, will also be managed by the Local Products and Materials Management Office. The procedures are simple, providing merchants with great convenience.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Province Police to Increase Pay</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 5th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The provincial government is committed to police work, but their pay is meager, and prices have risen several times over, which is a matter of great concern. Starting July 1st, police pay will be increased to stabilize their lives and encourage them to work hard. The specific measures for increasing pay will be announced in the near future.</p>
<h3>Wuhu to Handle the First Batch of Low-Priced Rice</h3>
<p>Wuhu, 5th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The county's survey of rice reserves and registration work has been completed. The total amount is more than 27,000 shi (石). According to the decision of the second session of the Price Stabilization Committee, 20% of the village rice will be extracted to serve as low-priced rice, which will be sent to the Price Stabilization Committee by county government personnel. The committee has decided to start selling the first batch of low-priced rice from the 6th, priced at 2,000 yuan per sheng (升). Each person is limited to purchasing six he (合) for large families and three he for small families per day, and purchases must be made with a rice purchase certificate.</p>
<h3>Australian Prime Minister Curtin Passes Away</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to a dispatch from Canberra, Australian Prime Minister and Labor Party leader Curtin passed away yesterday morning at the age of 60. Curtin has served as Australia's Prime Minister and Labor Party leader since 1941.</p>
<h3>The Warsaw Polish Government Will Be Recognized by Various Countries</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 5th (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to a Reuters diplomatic correspondent, informed sources in London believe that the Warsaw Polish Provisional Government of National Unity will be formally recognized by the United Nations. The British and American governments recently received a notification from the Warsaw Polish administrative party, stating: "The establishment of the government has been completed, and we guarantee that our provisional government will abide by the provisions of the Yalta Conference to implement a free election system."</p>
<h3>Simla Conference Postponed; Bose Broadcasts to the Country</h3>
<p>Shaonan, 5th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Subhas Chandra Bose, Chairman of the Provisional Government of Free India, recently broadcast to India regarding the postponement of the Simla Conference, the main points of which are as follows: various Indian factions at the Simla Conference have tried their best to avoid an immediate solution and have adopted a postponement decision. In fact, this is only a superficial move. The Indian people can have ample time to judge the British intentions during this period. At the same time, it can eliminate the use of the Anglo-Indian compromise plan by Churchill and other Conservatives in the general election on the 5th. In the future, the Indian side can negotiate with Britain from a favorable position. It was a good strategy for Gandhi not to participate in the Simla Conference, but the danger period has not yet passed. It is said that Gandhi told a United Press reporter: "I sincerely hope that the Simla Conference will be successful and can solve the problem." I hope that the meaning of Gandhi's "solution" does not mean surrendering to Britain. It seems that within the conference faction, there are those who believe that if the British cannot compromise with the Muslim League, the Governor-General should mediate. However, it is absolutely impossible for the Governor-General, the highest authority of British imperialism, to mediate, because this kind of measure is an outrage that the Indian people cannot tolerate. We must pay attention to the attitude of the Muslim League. Jinnah told reporters that they want to accept Wavell's proposal because it makes the separation of India possible. We often believe that the Governor-General and the Muslim League are in cahoots, using insidious means to suppress the conference faction.</p>

<p>Public Transportation Fare Adjustment</p>

<h3>Reply from the Municipal Food Regulation Committee: Procedures for Group Purchase of Coarse Grains</h3>

<h3>Strictly Observe Light Control Regulations</h3>
<p>Regarding the implementation of light control, the Municipal Civil Defense Headquarters has repeatedly issued statements urging citizens to pay close attention and prevent light from leaking.

Based on past experience, the hotter the weather, the more frequent enemy reconnaissance planes are at night. Therefore, it is hoped that all citizens will abide by the notice issued by the Longhai Air Defense Headquarters on May 10 of this year and the statements issued by the Municipal Civil Defense Headquarters, and implement alert control from 10:00 PM to sunrise the next day, regardless of whether there is an air raid alarm, and implement preparation control from sunset to 10:00 PM.</p>

<p>In order to eliminate the development of empty check drafts and crack down on the evil practice of discounting to maintain finance, the Central Reserve Bank, all clearing banks, and members of the money industry association stopped developing check drafts from the 3rd. Starting from the same day, in accordance with the regulations of the Central Reserve Bank, in addition to cash, parallel money immediate notes could be issued to customers for payment. The Central Reserve Bank, in order to adjust the market's cash needs, specially increased the issuance of 500 yuan and 1,000 yuan new banknotes from the 3rd, gave special cash payments for the salaries of employees of various financial institutions and all expenses, and increased the amount of cash that each bank could withdraw based on the total amount of deposits. The amount of cash that can be withdrawn daily must not be accumulated.

It is reported that after the Central Reserve Bank took this decisive measure, the wind of discounting has slowed down slightly in the past two days, and the discount has also fallen a lot.</p>
<h3>Piles of Garbage in Various Districts – Steps Being Taken to Clear it Up; Director Yuan of the Health Bureau Talks About Disposal Measures</h3>
<p>Recently, piles of garbage in various districts of Shanghai have accumulated into mountains. It is summer, and the impact on public health is significant.

The Second Section discussed it at a meeting of the Second Sections of various sub-bureaus and decided to contact the health authorities to discuss measures to clear it up. A reporter visited Director Yuan of the Health Bureau yesterday to ask about the disposal measures. He said:</p>
<p>Garbage Piles Being Cleared Up</p>
<p>Regarding the garbage clearance issue, the health authorities are very concerned and are actively taking steps to clear it up. Before the war, the authorities sent workers to take garbage trucks to various garbage docks, and then contractors transported the garbage by boat to the suburbs. Today, transportation is difficult, resulting in the accumulation of garbage. We are now planning a proper solution, urging contractors to find ways to transport it away, and strictly ordering garbage workers to actively clear it up. It should all be cleared soon.</p>
<p>Unified Management of Feces Clearance</p>
<p>When asked about the issue of feces clearance, he said: The city's feces cleaning business has always been contracted by merchants in different districts. Because of the separation of powers, management was difficult to perfect. Therefore, starting this spring, in order to unify the city's administration and implement the purpose of unified management, with the approval of the municipal government, the contractors merged and organized the Yongda Cleaning Company to uniformly contract the business. The scope of the contract includes the old First, Eighth, and Southwestern City districts, as well as Zhabei and other districts. The results of the cleaning work have been very satisfactory, and there has been no obstruction to the guidance of the authorities. In short, the health authorities are constantly striving for perfection in the city's public health issues.</p>
