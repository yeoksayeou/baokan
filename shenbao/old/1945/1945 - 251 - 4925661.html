<h3>處置偽幣與國家元氣</h3>
<p>— 姚仲拔</p>
<p>吾國經八年長期抗戰，國家元氣斷喪殊甚。目下急要之圖，在如何恢復元氣，培養國力？所謂國家元氣者，指政府之力量及國民之力量而言。此兩種力量之產生，全賴乎國家資源之發展。吾國資源一則爲廣大之地利，一則爲擴大之人力，並非貨幣就是資源。蓋貨幣者不過一種計値之籌碼，而非資源之實質。古人名貨幣爲國實，以國家之威信流通之，作爲交換之媒介。亦即今人所謂法幣，由政府之法令規定之作爲結算債權債務之繩準。至於幣値之高下，有待於供求調節之合宜，如資源（即物力與人力）之供求，與貨幣之流通額，互相平衡，則幣値自然穩定，斷非貨幣木身而能單獨發生任何經濟力量者也。明乎此，方可以言處置偽幣之問題。</p>
<p>査收復區械非當廣大，雖無確切之統計，其勢力所及，面積約佔全國二分之一以上，人口約佔全國三分之二以上，其流通之偽幣，計有東四省之滿鈔，黃河流域各省之聯準券，長江及珠江流域各省之中儲券，以及內蒙各省之蒙鈔，此項僞幣現雖毫無統計，但根據物價高漲及日軍收買物資等情形度之，其流通數額勢必驚人。此驚人之巨額僞幣所代表者，爲歷年被日人榨取之物力與人力，而賠償此項被榨取之物力與人力，斷非假定一　兌換率所能了事，亦非單獨顧全持右人目前之困難所能解決。蓋一方面卽須顧到收復區民衆之損失，而同時整個國家（即政府與完整區域及收復區域人民）之負擔與損失，尤不可不顧慮及之。故關於處置僞幣，應先認定目標，訂立原則，權衡輕重，兼籌並顧，方不致有頭痛醫頭腳痛醫脚之弊，致貽將來無窮之患。</p>
<p>認定目標　應認定所有因僞幣發生之損失，不論其爲團體或私人，當由負責發行者賠償之，吾國政府與完整區民衆卽無代負賠償之責，亦無代爲整理之義務，故目標爲處置，而非整。</p>
<p>訂立原則　政府如爲維持收復區民衆之暫時生活計，不妨限額收兌，或者責令金融機關，或農村合作社，質店，及類似金融機構之組織，以物資通融之，故原則爲救濟，而非代兌。</p>
<p>權衡輕重　收復區民衆如是之多，僞幣流通額如是之巨，在表面上則人民之損失勢必甚大，殊不知物價與薪工指數之飛漲，則偽幣之値巳屬貶無可貶，其每一單位所代表者，不過毫　之末，平均攤派每人之損失不致十分巨量。如政府顧念民生出而代兌，則全數負擔歸之政府，是由分擔損失，一變而爲獨負損失，殊不知政府支出，取之於民，歸根結底，不特收復區貧苦民衆未得救濟之實惠，而整區民衆亦經過八年茹苦含辛，同樣負檐損失，　理之平。故如由政府獨負僞幣之損失，不如仍由收復區民衆分擔之，因由收復區民衆分檐，則不致動搖整個國家之財政。</p>
<p>兼籌並願　處置偽幣所關甚大，但一方面不宜增加政府之負擔，因政府之負擔即整個國家之負檐，一方面須維持民衆之生活，須知代兌僞幣，不過一時之救濟，而永久民衆之生活所關尤大，切不可因岡目前之救濟，而忘永久之維護，至永久之計，應使做工者有工可做，服務者有務可服，農產品與工業品宜設法維持，不使價格慘落，以致傷農傷工，則民衆生活自然安定，國家復興可期而待。故謀目前之救濟，尤應願及未來之維護</p>
<p>根據以上所述，則處置偽幣爲一事，救濟民衆爲一事，兩者不可相混。僞幣所代表者爲巳榨取之資源，與現在國民經濟力量之實質，截然兩事，尤不宜相混。故吾人對此問題，切不可因救濟而涉及僞幣，救濟自救濟僞幣自僞幣，僞幣應責令負責發行者賠償之，不妨先由政府指定機關收取，而出一收據，以備將來取償。至於救濟方法，應分暫時與永久，暫時則限額收兌，或物資通融；永久則妥籌復員，維護農工。至所謂國民經濟力量，亦即國家元氣，斷非目前僞幣數字所能代表，實因僞幣數字之大，致引起一種心理上之錯誤爲康僞之數字，不足以指示國民所有物資眞實之價値。總之，無論如何不可因處置偽幣之故，而使國家元氣多受一重損失，此全國民衆所應注意者也。</p>
<h3>日軍駐南區部隊　昨全部撤退　各派遣部隊均將撤去</h3>

<h3>少數電車工人　昨無端滋事</h3>
<p>昨日有少數電車工人在楊樹浦一帶，强行阻止電軍行駛，宰軍警當局聞訊，即馳往彈壓，事態得未擴大。按該項滋事工人，爲前電軍公司因煤斤缺乏，致將電車路綫縮短停駛而被裁留職停薪之少數工人，但聞公司方面對該項工人，會陸續散發救濟費，最近又曾每人發給三十五萬元，大多數之工人，均能安分守巳，而有一小部份工人，則從中鼓動肇事，向公司方面，要挟給予多量救濟費，昨日在楊樹浦强行阻止電車行駛，幷將乘客趕下，致所有乘客及在工作之工人，對彼等之無理取鬧，均啓極大反感。聞此間當局對此項肇事工人，將査明嚴辦，蓋勝利究成，政府當局正從事復興建國工作，工人之利益當應顧到，但社會秩序之安寗，及公共交通之維持，則尤不容忽視也。</p>

<h3>Myriad People Line the Streets to Welcome General Tang's Journey Through Shanghai to the Capital to Attend the Japanese Surrender Signing Ceremony Before Returning to Shanghai</h3>

<p>Unprecedented Scene at Dachang Airport</p>
<p>After the news of General Tang's arrival in Shanghai spread, representatives from all sectors and citizens flocked to Dachang Airport to welcome him. From as early as 6 a.m., people began to gather along Jiangwan Road, with a continuous stream of vehicles. By noon, the crowds had swelled, with some walking, others riding bicycles, trucks, or cars in groups, all holding national flags and converging around the airport, numbering about 40,000 to 50,000. The police band, the Baojia office band, and the Filipino bands from various dance halls played music in unison, their sounds melodious and uplifting, while the sound of firecrackers never ceased. Prior to the arrival, the Shanghai All-Circles Victory Celebration Association hung a red banner with white characters that read "Welcome Commander Tang, Who Has Worked Hard and Achieved Great Merit" at the entrance of the airport. Giant national flags were placed on either side, and a V-shaped welcoming area was set up with large dining tables at the left corner of the entrance, ready for General Tang to rest after disembarking. Security at the airport was handled by the 121st Division of the Third War Area, which had just arrived in Shanghai the day before, and the Shanghai branch of the Youth Corps also dispatched inspectors to assist in maintaining order, ensuring thorough arrangements and excellent order.</p>

<p>Victorious General Smiles Broadly</p>
<p>Two large four-engine transport planes, numbered 054, carrying General Tang and his party, arrived at 1 p.m. yesterday. At 12:50 p.m., two P38 fighter planes first arrived and circled the airport for reconnaissance before flying away. Shortly after, the plane carrying General Tang and his party flew into the sky and circled once before slowly landing at the airport. Immediately, military music played loudly, firecrackers boomed, and cheers erupted. Representatives from all sectors, news reporters, photographers, and film crew members from the film propaganda unit swarmed towards the plane. After the door opened, several American dignitaries and staff members went aboard to greet them. After about five minutes, General Tang, the ever-victorious general, appeared at the door with a beaming smile. Following him were General Sun Yuanliang and others. Amidst cheers, they stepped off the plane, accepted flowers from Miss Liu Zuxiang, a representative of the Shanghai branch of the Youth Corps, and reviewed the honor guard. Then, Vice Mayor Wu led them to the welcoming area, where they rested briefly before departing from the airport by car.</p>
<h3>Carcade Stretches Like a Long Snake: General Tang Tours the City</h3>
<p>After General Tang and his party rested briefly in the welcoming area, they, along with Vice Mayor Wu and all the officers of the Third War Area, Sun Yuanliang, Zhang Xuezhong, Mou Tingfang, Yang Wen[missing name], and representatives from various government agencies and organizations, toured the city in over 200 cars. Deputy Commander Yang served as the commander of the motorcade. An official guidance vehicle from the municipal government led the way, followed by a Japanese military band vehicle, a Japanese escort team, a Chinese escort team, and then the car of Commander Tang, followed by Deputy Commander Zhang, Deputy Commander Sun, the U.S. liaison officer's car, then Commander Mou, various generals from the command post, U.S. personnel, representatives from various government agencies, news reporters, photographers, cars carrying welcoming and慰劳 from various sectors and the public, and finally, the Japanese and Chinese escort teams.

The over 200 cars formed a long snake formation, moving impressively. Along the way, the public lined the streets to welcome them, the cheers [missing characters]. At the time, the authorities announced a temporary curfew. When the motorcade welcoming General Tang's triumphant return surrounded the car carrying Tang and passed Jiang[missing character]wan Road, the students of Jiangwan Elementary School and over ten thousand citizens lined up to welcome him, shouting "Long live the Republic of China," "Long live Chairman Chiang," "Long live Commander Tang." General Tang and others in the car smiled and nodded in response. After the cars reached North Sichuan Road, the atmosphere became even more enthusiastic, with the sound of firecrackers and cheers deafening. Citizens on both sides waved national flags, creating a dazzling [missing character] wave. As they crossed Sichuan Road Bridge to Nanjing Road, the crowds were so dense that hundreds of thousands of citizens turned the wide Nanjing Road into a human wall, only allowing one car to pass. The cars drove through the gaps in the crowds and amidst the smoke from firecrackers. The people on both sides had tears of excitement in their eyes, shouting "Long live," like children seeing their parents returning home. Their excitement and painful memories were fully expressed in their faces. From Jing'an Temple Road to Avenue Edward VII, the general situation was similar to that on Nanjing Road. Along the way, Baojia military bands were dispatched by area to play music and pay respect as General Tang's car passed. When they reached the Cathay Hotel on Nanjing Road, over ten thousand people had gathered in front of the entrance to admire General Tang's demeanor. Yesterday, when Tang toured the city, the authorities specially announced a temporary curfew, with Japanese forces and Baojia police maintaining order. After the cars passed, the curfew was lifted.</p>

<h3>General Tang Delivers a Speech: Deeply Moved by the Reunion After Eight Years; Encourages Citizens to Work Hard to Assist in National Reconstruction</h3>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai, General Tang issued a written statement, the original text of which is as follows: Our war area has been ordered to take over the Nanjing-Shanghai area. I am here in Shanghai today, and seeing the warm welcome from all sectors of the population, I feel infinitely excited and honored. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, first, we should recognize that there are many factors contributing to today's victory, but the most important one is that our entire nation of soldiers and civilians, under the wise and steadfast leadership of Chairman Chiang, have remained steadfast through eight years of turbulent waves to achieve this victory. Therefore, in the future, for national reconstruction and even for the maintenance of world peace, we can only be led by Chairman Chiang continuously and eternally. We can only follow him to have freedom and happiness, and to bring the country to a state of well-being. Secondly, the people of Shanghai have made the greatest contribution to the country, shown the best performance, and suffered the most. Today, seeing the return of the National Army is like a reunion of family members and children after a long separation. The outpouring of emotion is the purest and most precious. However, while today's victory is worth celebrating, tomorrow's national reconstruction will be extremely difficult. We still need to have the confidence and effort to win the War of Resistance, and under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, ensure its success. The takeover work is now beginning. I hope that everyone, in the midst of the celebrations, will maintain the demeanor of a great nation, strictly abide by government laws and regulations, and assist our army and local governments in accomplishing their tasks. In particular, I hope that everyone who is here today is not only welcoming me personally and the troops I command, but also welcoming the regaining of freedom for Shanghai, welcoming a new Shanghai that has 100% of China's territorial sovereignty.</p>
<p>A Central News Agency reporter interviewed General Tang at the Cathay Hotel yesterday, asking for his impressions of arriving in Shanghai. General Tang replied with excitement that he took off from Liuzhou at 8:30 a.m. this morning and arrived in Shanghai after five hours. He originally was from Zhejiang, so he often passed through Shanghai before the War of Resistance, but it has been eight years since he last visited. After touring various places, he saw the crowds of people along the way, and the enthusiastic welcome situation moved him deeply. It proves that the people of Shanghai have a firm will, strictly maintain order, and truly deserve to be the demeanor of the citizens of the Great Republic of China. The Third War Area is ordered to take over the Nanjing-Shanghai area, and the future headquarters is planned to be established in Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Generals Sun and Mou Express Their Thoughts on Arriving in Shanghai</h3>
<p>General Sun Yuanliang Speaks</p>
<p>Scenes of Bloody Battles Vividly Before My Eyes</p>
<p>General Sun Yuanliang, who fought bloody battles at Zhabei and Dachang on August 13, said to the Central News Agency reporter after arriving in Shanghai yesterday: Eight years ago, when the August 13th incident broke out, I was the commander of the 88th Division, and I was ordered to lead my troops to fight in Shanghai. I fought bloody battles with the enemy in Zhabei for seventy-six days, and then moved positions and defended western Shanghai for a week. These scenes are still vividly before my eyes. Now that the victory has been achieved, I am following Commander-in-Chief Tang to serve in Shanghai again. The enthusiastic welcome from millions of citizens along the way moved me greatly, and I couldn't help but shed tears. He continued: "When the Eight Hundred Warriors defended the Sihang Warehouse eight years ago, I was also in command. I heard that some of them have reported for duty and are gathering. I will be able to meet them again soon, which is very gratifying. This time I have come to Shanghai and have a myriad of feelings. Apart from feelings, I have almost nothing to say."</p>
<p>Army Commander Mou Tingfang Speaks</p>
<p>The Future of China Holds Limitless Hope</p>
<p>Expressing his thoughts on arriving in Shanghai: "Today, seeing this enthusiastic situation, I am very moved, especially the pure and enthusiastic expressions of the children along the way, which make people even more excited. Although the children in the occupied areas of Shanghai have received a slavish education, the good family education they receive will ultimately not be affected by the slavish education. This gives the future of China limitless hope. We should all support Chairman Chiang, who has led us in the War of Resistance for eight years with a strong will and great hard work, and move towards the great path of national reconstruction, and persevere in preserving the glorious victory we have achieved today."</p>
<p>Public Servants Still Need Two and a Half Months to Return to the Capital; Minister Yu Reports on Traffic Conditions.</p>
<p>Chongqing, 7th - The resident members of the参政会 held their fourth meeting at 9 a.m. on the 7th. Jiang Yong chaired the meeting, and Yu Feipeng reported on the repatriation plan and the latest preparations. The following is a summary: ① Regarding the transportation of officials sent to the liberated areas, the government previously listed a list of 813 people. About 130 people have been sent to their destinations, and 200 people will be sent to the liberated areas on the 8th. China National Aviation Corporation currently has eight passenger planes, and plans to use three planes to maintain transportation in the rear and five planes to fly to various liberated areas. ② Regarding the issue of traffic repatriation. The Ministry of Transport has divided the northeast, Tianjin, Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan and Guangdong areas, and dispatched special commissioners to handle various reception and repatriation tasks. Personnel have also been sent to the area in Vietnam where our country has surrendered. ③ Regarding the preparation of vehicles for returning civil servants, according to statistics from the Administrative [missing character], there are a total of 212 units and approximately 37,025 civil servants in Chongqing, plus approximately 12,084 workers. Based on an estimate of 300 dependents per civil servant, there are approximately 114,000 dependents. The Ministry of Transport has prepared approximately 45 large and small ships, and five more can be added in October. Among these 50 ships, eight can sail to Nanjing, and the rest can only sail to Yichang and Hankou. Based on the calculation of the existing number of ships, all civil servants can be transported to Nanjing in two and a half months, and then dependents will be transported. Essential factories and ordinary people can all be repatriated by June of next year. Regarding civil servants, the number of military vehicles in the southeast and northeast provinces will increase. Because there is no [missing character] road connecting [missing character]guan to the Luoyang section, the Ministry of Transport [missing character] has deployed 50 military vehicles to transport [missing character].

<h3>Special Commissioner Zhan of the Central Propaganda Department Discusses Measures for Reorganizing Cultural Undertakings; All to Be Implemented in Accordance with the Central Government's Established Plan</h3>
<p>Zhan Wenyu, Special Commissioner of the Central Propaganda Department in Shanghai, has been visiting relevant authorities in recent days since his arrival in Shanghai to discuss the takeover of cultural and propaganda affairs in the city, and is extremely busy. It is learned that Mr. Zhan's special commissioner's office has been set up at No. 205 Xiafei Road, at the same address as the Southeast China Propaganda Commissioner's Office of the Central Propaganda Department, and has already begun operations. A Central News Agency reporter interviewed Mr. Zhan yesterday, inquiring about the reorganization of cultural undertakings in the city. According to Mr. Zhan, since the Japanese surrender, the people of the whole country have been extremely excited. The people of Shanghai, having suffered from the oppression of the enemy and puppets for eight years, are even more enthusiastic after liberation. The large number of newspapers and magazines that have been published in the last two weeks is a manifestation of this passion and excitement. However, the central government has long had a pre-determined plan for post-war reconstruction, and everything must be implemented in accordance with this plan in conjunction with the municipal government. There can be no arbitrary or rash actions, and the cultural sector is no exception. Therefore, the publication of all newspapers and magazines in the future must be in line with this established plan. Those that have not been approved by the central government will not be allowed to be distributed, in order to save manpower and material resources and meet the requirements of reconstruction work.</p>
<h3>Dealing with Counterfeit Currency and National Vitality</h3>
<p>— Yao Zhongba</p>
<p>Our country has suffered greatly from the long-term War of Resistance against Japan. The urgent task at hand is how to restore vitality and cultivate national strength. The so-called national vitality refers to the strength of the government and the strength of the people. The emergence of these two forces depends entirely on the development of national resources. One of our country's resources is the vast land and the other is the large labor force. Currency is not a resource. Currency is just a value marker, not the substance of a resource. The ancients called currency the foundation of the country, and it was circulated with the authority of the state as a medium of exchange. This is what people now call legal tender, which is stipulated by the government's laws as a standard for settling debts. As for the level of currency value, it depends on the proper adjustment of supply and demand. If the supply and demand of resources (that is, material and human resources) and the amount of currency in circulation are balanced, the currency value will naturally stabilize. Currency itself cannot independently generate any economic power. Only when this is understood can we talk about the problem of dealing with counterfeit currency.</p>
<p>Upon investigation, the liberated areas are indeed vast. Although there are no accurate statistics, their sphere of influence accounts for more than half of the country's area and more than two-thirds of the country's population. The counterfeit currencies in circulation include Manchurian notes in the four northeastern provinces, Joint Reserve Certificates in the provinces of the Yellow River basin, Central Reserve Certificates in the provinces of the Yangtze River and Pearl River basins, and Mongolian notes in the provinces of Inner Mongolia. Although there are currently no statistics on these counterfeit currencies, judging from the soaring prices and the Japanese army's purchase of materials, the amount in circulation must be alarming. What this alarming amount of counterfeit currency represents is the material and human resources that have been extracted by the Japanese over the years. Compensating for this extracted material and human resources cannot be accomplished by simply assuming a certain exchange rate, nor can it be solved by solely taking into account the current difficulties of the people. On the one hand, we must take into account the losses of the people in the liberated areas. At the same time, the burden and losses of the entire country (that is, the government and the people in the complete area and the liberated areas) must be taken into consideration. Therefore, regarding the disposal of counterfeit currency, we should first identify the goals, establish principles, weigh the pros and cons, and consider all aspects, so as not to have the disadvantages of treating the head when it hurts and the feet when they hurt, which may cause endless troubles in the future.</p>
<p>Identifying the goal should recognize that all losses caused by counterfeit currency, whether to groups or individuals, should be compensated by those responsible for issuing it. Our government and the people in the complete area have no responsibility to bear the compensation, nor do they have any obligation to reorganize it. Therefore, the goal is disposal, not reorganization.</p>
<p>Establishing the principle: If the government wants to maintain the temporary livelihood of the people in the liberated areas, it may as well collect them for a limited amount, or order financial institutions, rural cooperatives, pawnshops, and similar financial institutions to provide materials. Therefore, the principle is relief, not exchange.</p>
<p>Weighing the pros and cons: There are so many people in the liberated areas, and the amount of counterfeit currency in circulation is so huge. On the surface, the people's losses will inevitably be great. However, the soaring prices and wage indexes mean that the value of counterfeit currency has depreciated to the point where it cannot be depreciated. What each unit represents is only a negligible amount. The average loss per person is not very large. If the government considers people's livelihood and comes forward to exchange it on behalf of the people, then the entire burden will fall on the government. This is a change from sharing the loss to bearing the loss alone. As everyone knows, government expenditure is taken from the people. In the final analysis, not only the poor people in the liberated areas will not receive the benefits of relief, but the people in the entire area will also endure the same hardship after eight years and bear the loss in the same way, which is not fair. Therefore, if the government alone bears the loss of counterfeit currency, it is better for the people in the liberated areas to share it. Because if the people in the liberated areas share it, it will not shake the finances of the entire country.</p>
<p>Comprehensive planning: The disposal of counterfeit currency is of great concern. On the one hand, it should not increase the government's burden, because the government's burden is the burden of the entire country. On the other hand, we must maintain the people's livelihood. It should be known that exchanging counterfeit currency on behalf of the people is only a temporary relief, and the livelihood of the people in the long run is of great importance. Do not forget the long-term maintenance because of the current relief. As for the long-term plan, we should make it possible for workers to work, for those who serve to serve, and for agricultural and industrial products to be maintained in price, so as not to make prices fall miserably, causing harm to farmers and workers. Then the people's livelihood will naturally be stable, and national rejuvenation can be expected. Therefore, in seeking current relief, we should also consider future maintenance.</p>
<p>Based on the above, the disposal of counterfeit currency is one thing, and relieving the people is another. The two should not be confused. What counterfeit currency represents is the resources that have been extracted, which is completely different from the substance of the current national economic power. Even more, it should not be confused. Therefore, we must not involve counterfeit currency because of relief. Relief is relief, and counterfeit currency is counterfeit currency. Counterfeit currency should be compensated by those responsible for issuing it. The government may designate an agency to collect it first and issue a receipt for future compensation. As for relief methods, they should be divided into temporary and permanent. Temporary relief should be limited to the amount of exchange, or the exchange of materials. Permanent relief should be properly planned for restoration and maintenance of agriculture and industry. As for the so-called national economic power, that is, national vitality, it cannot be represented by the current number of counterfeit currencies. In fact, the large number of counterfeit currencies has caused a psychological error, and the number of Kangwei is not enough to indicate the true value of the national resources. In short, no matter what, we must not allow national vitality to suffer another loss because of the disposal of counterfeit currency. This is what all the people of the country should pay attention to.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Stationed in the Southern District Withdrew Completely Yesterday; All Detached Units Will Be Withdrawn</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese garrison in this city accepted the surrender, all military actions have ceased. The troops stationed in various districts of the city have also begun to withdraw. The southern district troops stationed at the former Citibank building at the intersection of Fuzhou Road and Henan Road also withdrew completely yesterday. All military supplies were moved away, and the name of the southern district troops has also been abolished.

<h3>Contributions for Comforting the National Army Pour in from All Sectors</h3>
<p>The office in Shanghai of all sectors receiving Allied and National Army troops received a continuous stream of comfort items from all sectors yesterday, which was very enthusiastic. Zhang Maoxing donated 25 dozen bottles of soda, and Wang Shenfu donated 360 handkerchiefs. The association specially prepared 500 catties and 17 packages of biscuits, which were sent by special train to the 363rd Regiment of the National Army stationed at Fudan University in Jiangwan at 4:00 PM yesterday. According to the person in charge of the association, what the National Army troops in Shanghai urgently need now are food and medical supplies, such as cotton wool, gauze, and skin disease medicines. Those who wish to donate can contact the general affairs section of the Pao Ma Ying Office directly. The telephone number is 30109.</p>
<h3>A Few Tram Workers Caused Trouble for No Reason Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a few tram workers in the Yangshupu area forcibly prevented the trams from running. The military and police authorities rushed to the scene upon hearing the news and suppressed the situation, preventing it from escalating. It is reported that the troublemaking workers were a small number of workers who had been laid off by the former tram company due to the shortage of coal. However, it is reported that the company has been distributing relief funds to the workers in succession, and recently distributed 350,000 yuan to each person. Most of the workers are able to live peacefully, but a small number of workers incited trouble from the middle, demanding a large amount of relief funds from the company. Yesterday, they forcibly prevented the trams from running in Yangshupu and drove the passengers off, causing all passengers and workers on duty to be extremely disgusted with their unreasonable trouble. It is reported that the authorities here will investigate and severely punish the troublemaking workers. After all, the victory has been achieved, and the government authorities are engaged in reconstruction work. The interests of the workers should be taken into account, but the security of social order and the maintenance of public transportation should not be neglected.</p>
<h3>Western, Southern, and Northern Guerrilla Training Class Establishes a Liaison Office in Shanghai</h3>
<p>During the War of Resistance, the Military Affairs Commission established a Western, Southern, and Northern Guerrilla Training Class.

In order to communicate and contact each other, and for future tasks, a liaison office has been established at No. 455 Ximen Road. Preparations were completed yesterday, and alumni flocked to register after hearing the news, and sent a telegram to pay their respects to Chairman Chiang.</p>
<h3>Late Rice is on the Market in Various Places; Rice Industry Prepares to Purchase</h3>
<p>Late rice has begun to appear on the market in various places and can be harvested and stored gradually by the end of this month. The rice industry is trying to resume rice operations in order to transport rice to Shanghai in a steady stream, but land and water transportation needs to be assisted by the authorities. At present, the rice shops have resumed selling rice one after another. Most of the spot goods needed for retail sales are purchased from customers. It is expected that the rice market in this city will soon return to its original state.</p>
