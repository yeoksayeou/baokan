<h3>當局因新登塲在即　正考慮糧政施策　收配機構仍分軍需與民需</h3>
<p>南京二十五日中央社電　國府當局於六月初句，爲圖滑米糧流通安定民食起見，毅然將原頒米糧移動限制撤銷，准許自由運銷，同時盟邦軍政當局亦竭誠協助，停止軍米收買，自此以後，京·滬各地米價得稍趨穩定，且際此靑黃不接時期，亦賴以濟度。惟該項辦法原屬臨時性質，現新毅登塲之期層屆，當局正考意今後之糧政施策，據聞原則上仍將分區收買，且收配機構仍有軍需·民需之別，國人對此無不深爲關隊。蓋以往糧政施策之所以未能收獲預期效果，其主要原因除人事之不健全，法令之不統一外，即爲採購制度與運配機構之根本失之紊亂紛歧，而不能統收統配，統一運營，是故國人咸深望當局祥察過去利弊，對今後施策愼加考慮，免蹈覆轍。</p>
<h3>東亞戰役陣亡勇士　森桂大佐等行賞　日賞勳局及陸軍省發表</h3>
<p>東京二十五日中央社電　日天皇陸下於二十六日對陸軍關係第三十一屆大東亞戰械陣亡者論功行賞，此事業由賞勳局及賞者，係於大東亞戰爭勃發後，在中國大陸及西南太平洋方面勇戰奮鬥，最後以身殉國之日軍勇士，並包括在滿洲及內地部隊之軍人軍屬等，其中以武功超軍蒙受受殊勳甲等之光榮者，爲轟炸機部隊長功四旭三等森桂大佐等百五十名，該部隊長曾迭次參加航空作戰，樹立赫赫武勳，于去年八月三日不幸于攻擊陝西省安康機塲時戰死，且此殊勳者中並包括台灣海面拼撞敵艦之高橋末正少佐等八十七各。</p>
<h3>岡村大將聲明美評論家贊同</h3>
<p>中央社訊　日駐華派遺軍總司令官岡村大將，於本月九日對華人記者團發表談話，「日軍全部如武裝撤兵，需要約二年之時日」一節，國內外均極注意，據此間接獲舊金山廣播，美國著名軍事評論家勞倫斯，曾於紐約日報上著文評稱，口軍欲由中國撤退，需要二年之岡村火將所言，確非虛盲。此因現在可利用之船舶極少，假如百萬日軍或更多之軍隊，此後即使不受美軍工　船舶，欲援助防衛日本土而返國，此舉已不可能。岡村將軍之結語，即是「日軍以不撤爲佳」，此項評語，無論與某種和平運動有關與否，此間各方面殆認此係軍事上之正確措置。</p>
<h3>粵澳訂定貿易辦法</h3>
<p>廣州二十五日中央社電　本省對澳門之物資交流，向係根據香港貿易核定出入口金額計算，且澳門現無專責辦理輸出口各處之團體或商行，致省澳物資交流未能圓滑發展，最近省澳兩方當局經協議訂定粵澳貿易晳行辦法多項，日前開始招商經營。</p>

<h3>渭河三角地帶　渝共武裝衝突　雙方調集軍力事態嚴重</h3>
<p>中央社滬訊　據抵達此間之情報稱：二十一日渡過陝西省中部涇江繼續集結北岸之胡宗南軍第五十九帥，突然警備耀縣淳化一帶，對延安軍開始攻擎，同時對守備涇陽興平兩城之延安軍挑戰，渭河三角地帶及涇河洛河沿岸地帶，均化爲悽烈之戰塲。因重慶軍有美式裝備，故延安軍至二十三日止，傳有相富死傷。已開始正式之內戰。又渝軍停止隴海綫全綫火車搭載乘客，繼績由該方面運輸部隊，兵力已增强至九師，但一方延安亦由冀察邊區開始調動第十八集團軍，事態漸呈惡化。</p>
<p>中央社滬訊　據二十三日延安之新華社電：二十一日渝軍第五十九師部隊突向陝廿寗邊區關巾區之共軍守備地淳耀縣爺合山，猛然以砲火猛攻，共軍以守衞陣地爲原則，尙未出擊，戰鬥迄二十三日未停止。對此延安」方面以爲重慶當局大規模開始進攻邊區，甚爲憤　，二十三日以第十八集團軍朱彭正團總司令之名，通電與蔣軍委會委員長及西安之胡宗南第一戰區長官，要求制止此攻擎云。據新華社電，該項通電全文如次：「據隊甘寗邊區關中分區該部之報吿，一週以來西安方面突發生變化，反共之聲囂囂，多數軍隊由陝州靈一帶之抗日前綫陸續移動，隴海鐵路已停止商業運輪，晝夜輸送軍隊，已在同官，耀縣·涇陽·乾縣·興平一帶，展開第一軍第一師·第三軍第七師·第七軍暫編第二十六師·第十六軍預備第一師預備第三師·第三十六重第五十二師·第五十九師·第八十軍誓編第三十七師第百六十五師合計九師，以反共第一抗日第二爲標語，進攻邊區，企圖殺戮共黨。七月二十一日第五十九師部隊突然前來攻擊我邊區　耀縣之爺台山一帶，激戰已及三日，無停止之兆，想大敵在目前，國民之命派與國共兩　之團結有關，聯合軍由東西移動，我國以調整內部與聯合軍配合向敵反攻之際，忽然接內戰之警報而驚駭，該部隊除守備守地外無他意，特以當文希望制止之，並盼覆音」，</p>

<h3>吳江百態</h3>
<p>— 直</p>
<p>凡事對江蘇情形比較　悉一點的人，大都知道吳江城鎮間有著一個奇特的現象。那就是縣城比不上市鎭，不論市况方面，財富方面，處處市鎭比較城區勝過多多。</p>
<h3>鎮富縣貧</h3>
<p>吳江十江蘇省的一等縣，轄有九區一百餘鄉鎮，在理，縣城的市況似乎應該相當繁榮了，可是不然，城中出了北塘街略爲有些小小的店鋪外，只有東門外合北門外市面較爲熱閙，但是也不過是一些五洋雜貨店和國藥備之類而已。至於這裏面的原因，大概可分二種來說：第一十她所屬的市鎮大都太富了，譬如盛澤震澤同里平望等四大鎭，每處都比縣城富，鄉民並不需要進城來採辦貨物，第二是離蘇州太近了，只不過三十六里路，在蘇嘉路通車的時候，不過半小時就能到達，居民若需要什麼的話，儘可到蘇州去買，即使在現在蘇嘉路停頓以後，水路還有本柴引擎的船，陸路有人力車和汽車可通，所以至今縣城，市容始終不能興盛。</p>
<h3>絲業凋零</h3>
<p>吳江和它所屬的鄉鎭，一向以產絲綢出名的，尤其以盛澤珍澤二鎮爲全縣冠，大概對本國土產稍稍注意一些的人，總都聽到過「盛澤紡」「緝里絲」的名稱的，這都是本縣的特產啊。除了盛澤震澤以外，嚴墓平望等鎮業產有大量的蠶絲，所以境內桑　特多，蠶農依著謀生的實在不在少數。說起今年春蠶，很是凄慘，因了今年蠶種稀少的綠故（稀少的原因在於今年東種到得特別少，而各國內製種塲鑒於去年受了東種傾銷的敎訓，今年又製得比去年少，所以形成蠶種缺乏的現象），蠶種的價格也就飛黃騰達起來。譬如壽星牌種吧，有些地方甚至抬到一萬以上，到後來幾天，蠶農只要有種，那怕去年置諸不問的雜牌種，今年也當作奇貨了。雖然如此，蠶種缺乏總是一個不可否認的事實，通帶桑　也火量的過剩了，桑葉在開始育蠶的時候是二千元一擔，到蠶期將結束的時候，甚至跌到一千元一擔還沒有人過問，這種現象，恐怕也是近年來破天荒的一次吧！</p>
<p>吳江土地肥沃，食米也產得相當多，所以這裘收購米糧的成績，相當不差，在國府未頒停止購米以前，農民非當痛苦，因爲購米並不規定次數，三次四次…這樣收購下去，農民自然日見窮困了。</p>
<h3>治安情形</h3>
<p>吳江的縣境，範圍相富大，包括從前的震澤吳江二縣合併而成，分爲九區一百餘鄉鎮，其中以盛澤，震澤，同里，平望，嚴墓，八坼，　墟，黎里諸　最大，各區鄉鎭的區鄉鎭長大都很有辦法，因爲他們是直接與農民發生關係的，收人方面當然可直接取之於農民了，用不着轉灣抹角。奉米三斗業可按時取得，不會欠欠幾個月這樣欠下去，不過區公署的事務也相當繁忙，譬如修築公路啊，派伕子啊，供給各機關的薪柴啊，都耍區公所負責。有的區公署中辦事員作威作福，甚至有羅潛酒毒打農民的事，希望縣政府於甄選地方基層行政人員時，能特別注意。</p>
<p>治安情形，也今非昔比了，爲了生活的艱難，爲了種種的剝削，人民挺而走險的漸漸增多，持械搶刦的事，常常可以聽到，譬如盛澤鎭在上月遭了洗刦以後，不久同里鎭又發生了白畫　刦　槍殺後莊經理一案，而就在吳江城東門外繁盛的盛團州，也在有一夜連刦了十五家，可是，這還不過是一個開始，倘使生活再不能改善，人民最低的生活需要不能維持，這以後的發展，眞沒有人敢說了。</p>
<h3>賭風熾烈</h3>
<p>吳江城鄉，現在睹風很盛，這也是農民生活苦悶不能發泄的一個象徵，他們何嘗不如道賭有傾家　產的危險，但是他們却抱着「飲酖止渴」的能度給久經壓迫而嘛木的神經來一個深深的激刺。此外當地特殊階級的提倡也是原因之一，譬如當地方上一位小大事有婚喪喜慶時，總是擺幾只所謂大小抬子引得一班意志薄弱的人趨之若驚，如此而傾家的眞十比比皆是。</p>
<p>吳江街上的稻草灰滿街飛揚，偌大一個公園無人看管，以至於一只四面應給小孩捉　雀把瓦都丟光了，可是最不應該的是消防　繼不完善，城中水龍一修都沒有，個若有火營澤不是眼睜睜地看它　？這一點眞希望吳江縣政府當局能竭力設法改善！</p>
<p>吳江的文化方面，價是貧乏得可憐，雖然城區有一只完全中學和一只江蘇省立敎育學院附設的鄉邨師範及幾只小學，可是學生不多·而口出售雜誌書籍的書店體家都沒有，由此可見這一個縣城的文化程度是如何了，報紙方面出有吳江公報一張（八開的）是十日刋·所載的也不邊是　　政府的決議等項，消息很少。</p>
<p>食糧方面，現在比較價格低落一些了，米價大約三十九萬左右，小麥十七萬左右，現在江蘇省政府計劃利用蘇嘉路廢　來開墾，以資增產，這當然六一日十足的好買賣，著　能字日當</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>金價於物價</h3>
<p>這幾天，金價的暴　已成爲投機資本集中的目標。因爲金價的暴　，各種物價也追隨直上，因此，一般市民的生活遭受嚴重的威脅。</p>
<p>我們要抑制物價的上漲，必須先行抑制金價的暴滕。金價暴　的原因：第一，不必諱言的由於每期金證券發行價格上昇過速的刺激；第二，由於投機的猖獗，人爲的操縱。而我們研究金價暴騰的實際，前者似乎是表面的原因，引起動機而已，後者才是眞實的　結，乘水推舟，激起了如此的高潮，可是二者的關係實在非常審切，因爲金設券　期發行價格的上昇，才使投機商人有可乘之機。我們要抑制金價的暴騰必須寶此作一檢討。</p>
<p>關於抑制金價的暴　，有種種議論：有人以爲今後金證券的發行也認爲有研究的幹地，但是金證券發行的原意在可以　此收回一部分儲備券，一方面可以減少通貨膨眼的發展，他方面可以作爲　達收買物資的資金，在原則上是無可非議的。不過操之過急，就成爲助長金價暴騰的原因，而金價暴騰所引起的物價上漲，事實上反超過了金證券收回的儲備券所能減少的通貨膨眼的影響。我們認爲金證券的制度是余融當局車要的創意，而金證券價格的決定應該深切研究，今後的轉換，必須以抑制金價之暴騰爲前提。</p>
<p>又有人以爲金條易可以用强力來彈壓，然而我們現在與其希望常局使用行政權力，不如希學富局能够合理的調節金價。大陸新報所論，假如正常的金條父易因爲彈奪的緣故，轉變爲黑百交易，於是統制更其困難，我們也深信這是事實。幷且大陸新報所提出的三個原則，的確可以作爲此次決策的參考，尤其規定金價漲落差額一點，更切中肯　。</p>
<p>至於物價的上漲。固然因爲金價暴騰的趨勢稍殺，而能緩和上漲的速度。可是決不因爲今價停止暴勝而回跌。况且金價的漲落是少數投機商人獲利的對象，而物價的漲落普遍影嚮於一般市民。因此這次物價的上漲雖然主要的原因是由於金價的上漲，可是抑制金價的暴騰，僅是抑制物價的一種方法，而不是壓平物價的根本方策。</p>
<p>假如金價的暴騰，和日常必需品的價格，可以採取經濟的政策而加以隔離，我們富然贊同的。可是，只有刺激金價上漲的力量，而沒有抑制一般物價不受金價影響的把握，更沒有隔離金價與物價之間聯觀的把握，所謂畫虎不成反類犬，這種有關民生的措施，決不能出之嘗試性質的。</p>
<p>總之，經濟政策不是片面的，必須綜合的，金價和一般物價的施策，不但應該在價格政策上實施綜合的統制，並且在通貨政策上，也必須與此配合進行，才能見效於整個民生問題。我們希望中日當局，共同重視戰時經濟政策的實施，必須同時顧到配合國民經濟，不能忽略國民經濟的重要性。</p>
<p>譯論</p>
<h3>金問題處理之原則</h3>
<p>金價愈形騰貴，幾無底止。同時，以金價之暴騰，誘發一般物價之騰貴，在戰時經濟之立塲，此種現象已不能置之不顧。試觀察金價騰貴最甚之過去一旬餘之物價，可知除米糧之外，金價旣牽引諸物價，同時諸物價亦一齊追隨金價，因此，今後如放任不顧，則物價問題之解決更其困難，金價騰貴之原因在於投機現象，此爲任何人所目擊之事實。由於何人，作何種投機，此問題從金市塲公開之事實推測，瞭如指掌。因此·如欲彈壓投機，以抑制金價，只耍當局下一決心，非常簡易。然而吾人對於僅用彈壓之政策，並無重大期待。投機之彈壓，或使余倏交易轉變爲黑市交易。投機之原因旣未消除，而迫使造成黑市，則金價之變動更難統制，經濟的惡劣影響更有增大之處。雖然不當之投機固應加以取締，而强壓一般之交易，似有考慮之必要。取締當然以投與現象爲對象，但投機與正當交易，不易區別。如將正常交易亦加彈壓，則金說券賣出之根本觀念完全否認。</p>
<p>然則改不採用强　投機之政策，而欲抑制投機現象，究有何種方策？雖然此種方法不止一二，而吾人竭力主張下列三種根本對策：　敵密監督本票之發行，如事實可能，實現特殊本票之劃一。　嚴格檢查金融機關，嚴罰投機資金之放出·　金條交易加以制限，規定每日漲落之差額，超道此差額時，發令停止交易。如右述諸條件能正確實行，投機現象自然抑制。投機之所以猖獗，由於投機資金之放出，於現階段此種資金，除金融機關以外，無從獲得，更進一步言之，雖金融機關，亦不能無限制擁有多數　資。問題所在，乃使金融機關得有輕易創造信用之手段，因此有本票之發行，其理不待論究，至爲明顯。至於交易時設置差額制限，超過此差額，即行停止交易之一法，乃證券交易所採用之手段，於金條交易亦可適用。如右述各種措置得以綜合實施，則金條之投機可以抑制至相當程度。</p>
<p>最後，吾人希望取締投機，固不願羅人之後，然而因強硬取締，迫使金條交易變爲黑市，必須加以營戒。同時於取締之時，向有只捕雜魚，而漏却吞舟之魚的可嫌的現象。雖然出現於投機表面者大多爲雜魚之類亦屬必須注意之事實，兩捕捉吞舟之魚，只要一探現在擁有最多金條之少數金融資本家之真相，即可辦到。但就各種情勢言之，此舉更希學愼重出之。因此，可能實施而且效率正確之方法爲上述三個原則。吾人切望中日當局能自上述諸觀點出發，積極處理整個問題（譯自七月廿五日大陸新報）</p>
<h3>蘇各界募集義捐救濟滬羅災市民</h3>
<p>蘇州二十五日中央社電　敵機之盲炸上海地區，殺傷無辜市民，此種非人道行爲，此間深抱不滿，江蘇地方銀行總經理任西萍及此間金融工商界領袖數人，現發起向本市市民募集義捐金，業已　集五千餘萬元，將於日內首次致送與上海市民福利協會，以表對空襲羅災市民之拯濟。</p>
<h3>蘇省垣舉行防空演習</h3>

<h3>修築公路積極進行</h3>
<p>蘇州二十五日中央社電　本省各公路修築工程，於建設總工程處之主持下，各項工程推進至爲迅速。蘇當·蘇嘉兩公路，業已光後竣工，恢復一切車輛交通。又蘇滬公路，本省內路面約於下月中旬可以竣工，又蘇錫等公路，現正積極擬具修築計劃。</p>
<h3>粵省府接收　商統分會</h3>
<p>廣州二十五日中央社常　全國商統總會粵分會，奉令於最近裁撤後，二十四日業由省府派員接收，關於該會經辦有關商業統制運輸許可等事項，均歸併建廳第四科辦理。</p>
<h3>德義戰犯　受審地點</h3>
<p>已决定在紐倫堡</p>
<p>十五日巾央社電　據倫敦消息：自三頭會談以來，德國現作第二次維護安全之工作，蓋德義兩國戰時罪犯或將在德國某地區進行審判。又據倫敦發刋之紐約時報載稱，英美蘇法四國業於日前擬定戰時罪犯審判程序條例，各代表均一致贊同審判在德國舉行，且實際上已劃定紐倫堡爲審訊之處。今審訊者果眞在紐倫堡舉行，則換言之，即在美國第三軍管轄區內舉行，故美軍高級指揮人員已請約克遜等，指示維持安全之妥善辦法，以防止納粹份子及反納粹份子乘機　禍生事。</p>
<h3>墨索里長子　拘禁集中營</h3>
<p>百倫二十五日中央社電　據瑞士電合引瑞士與義大利邊境消息稱：前義大利首相墨索里尼之長子維多利亞墨索里尼，業於日前向聯合國軍方面投降，現暫被押禁於某集中管內。</p>
<h3>三頭會談與東亞局勢　美亟謀解決對日作戰</h3>
<p>東京二十五日中央社電　美國自特魯曼總統就職以來，一改羅斯福之獨裁主義，與國會方面密切速絡，並更迭國務鄉政府要人，發揮預料不及之政治手腕，故在國內方面，其穩健的手腕，實較前任故羅總統有過之無不及，尤有進者，美國雖已參戰四年，照國內形勢，國民生活大致上尙稱安定，一般國民又因戰爭勝利而趾高氣揚，對於佔據前途，莫不抱勝利之自信。惟關於對日戰爭，近來各方面莫不希望早日結束，即特魯曼以次政府人士亦抱，此種急切之希望，母寗己形成一種焦躁不安。蓋世界戰雲已因德國之投降而吿一段落，歐洲方面己進八戰後淸理之階段，惟在東亞仍與日本作殊死之戰，使美國不得不繼續出血，給予美國所晝夜顧慮之戰後世界政策以重大阻礙。故由美國言，爲搶前蘇聯及歐洲各國之戰後政策而不落後，且以現在之有利立塲，執世界政局之牛耳，則迅速結東對日戰爭，完爲當前急務。觀最近之外電，我人不難發見美國之對日和平攻勢，惟此爲具有謀略企圖之美國式之惡辣手段，美國堅持無條件投降，其將於政治作戰兩方面展開達規模之侵略東亞，甚爲明顯。現於柏林郊外波次坦舉行之三頭會護，傳開會第一次即提出討論東亞問題，其次有關東亞政治問題之另一動向，爲前後達六次之史太林宋子文會談，談項會談因三頭會議舉行之故，暫吿停頓，事有可注者，在宋子文訪蘇之前夕，曾在美周詳徵求美國對東亞問題之意見，蓋史太林宋子文會談，形式上雖爲蘇聯與重慶之會議，實際上乃關於東亞題題之美蘇預備會議，宋子文稱之曰美國之代辯人可也。故會談雖前後達六次之多，據正式發表仍謂未達任何解決。由此經　判斷，可知關於東亞問題，英美蘇之談判實難以簡單解決。惟三頭會議果已有如何種之諒解，姑作別論，由日本言，則三國之討論東亞問題，自不能不抱關心，總而言，最近美國政戰兩略之對日攻勢，極爲活潑，然此恐亦爲美國之當套謀略，而係敵人疏忽之表現。據此間人士表示日太今後出路，惟有一條，即鉋摧毀美國之攻勢，遭進完成戰爭之信念是。</p>
<h3>日本外交殊堪重視</h3>
<p>東京二十五日中央社電此間「東京新聞」二十五日以「殊堪重視之日本外交一要因」爲題論稱，三顯會談之主要角，厥爲史太林，此點應加注目，現在蘇聯之煊赫國際地位，已爲世界所側目，歐戰結束後進謁克林　宮者踵接，史太林於今日世界政治上之地位，較之上次歐戰米期威爾遜之地位有增無減。歐戰結東後，美英蘇打倒德國之共同目標即達到，對於蘇聯已非向共同目標邁進之盟邦，而以調整解決利害關係之盟邦視蘇聯矣。蘇聯現已由戰爭之重担中解放，已可廣流閘自由發揮其手腕。反之，美英尚有對日戰爭之困難事件，故對蘇聯不得不讓步。三頭會談中之蘇聯立塲旣如前述，故此後世界須由史太林心中決定者極多，此事於今日之日本外交，應該爲最堪重視一要素也。</p>
<h3>中國問題內情複雜</h3>
<p>里斯本二十五日中央社電關與三頭會談，以東亞問題亦列爲議題之一，頻由英美兩國電報所傳，惟該項消息之內容，似均係臆測而己。各項報道之主題，均有關史太林宋子文會談所準備之蘇聯對華政策，以及與太平洋戰局具有關聯之英美東亞政策。惟中國內部複雜之政治紛爭，與英美蘇三國互相之利害關係，究將如何調整一點，似尚未獲得結果·茲引舉主要論調於次：美李普曼於先驅論壞報上，指摘於重慶統制圈外所存在之延安勢力，述稱欲解決中國問題，在蘇聯與中國問如無明確之諒解存在，或美國不表承認，則進行實極困難，即以聯邦國家之方式，能否統一中國頗有由外蒙伸張至黃河之危　，美英方面對於天子文之莫斯科工作，希望獲得阻止赤色勢力南下之效誌曾載稱，史宋會談業已成立某種協定之基礎云。李普曼亦曾論及此問題，假設宋史兩者間果眞成立協定，但宋子文及重慶政權對於廣大之中國領土，究具如何之權力，以及美國是否有能力實行一般協定，表示疑問。「每日電聞報」外交記者關於三頭會談之東亞問題，抱沉默態度，該報僅稱，三頭會談將討論蘇聯積極參加現戰局之問題。</p>
<h3>邱吉兩返國一行波次坦會議休會　英總選結果今可揭曉</h3>
<p>瑞典京城二十五日中央社電　據路透社波次坦電稱：三頭會談於二十四日會議後，遂即陷於休會狀態，因英首相邱吉爾偕同外相艾登及阿特里，於二十五日歸返倫敦，視察二十六日至英總選舉結果後，將於二十七日複返波次坦。在此休會期間內，三國會議事務局爲應付再開會議。將整備議題或準備會談完畢之報吿書。</p>
<p>瑞典京城二十五日中央社電　據路透社訪員著稱：邱士爾與阿特里兩人，孰能爲英國繼任首相之消息，於週四下午四時方能有所透露。昨日波次坦三頭作最後一次之會談，蓋英國之領袖人員均將於今日返歸倫敦。倫敦政界方面深信不管選舉勝利屬保守黨或勞工黨，邱吉爾阿特里兩人仍將同赴柏林以繼續會談。</p>
<h3>美國飛機生產</h3>
<p>東京二十五日中央社電　敵美爲對付大東亞戰爭而制定之飛機生產計劃，側重製造B29型機一電，目不待論，然近來對此方針又復轉變爲採取中型轟炸機及戰鬥機之重點主義，殊值注目。</p>
<h3>貝當受審續記　法前總理萊諾供詞</h3>
<p>百倫二十五日中央社電　據此問接獲消息：貝當元首在「害國通敵」變重罪名之下，於昨日再度受審，巴黎地方法院庭上已充滿猶如國會舉行辯論時之氣象。前在德國突入巴黎時之法國總理萊諾，於其供認法國如何戰敗之詞中，聲明渠在一九四○年極爲相信貝當將軍之愛國，實爲一根本之錯誤。庭上旁聽者因週一員當拒絕置答各項訊問，致興趣轉淡，然地方法院門前依舊有一千名武裝憲兵嚴寗防駐。</p>
<p>開審時由萊諾繼續其上日中斷之供詞，略謂，「自貝當將軍被推爲法國元首時，渠即頒發一指派各部要員之委任令，其中猶未見有賴伐爾之名字，雖然當時賴伐爾已與貝當極爲接近。至於有關停戰協定一事，我直至六月二十三日方始獲悉，憶及海軍上將達朗曾一度聲明，決以全力保持各港法國艦船不落敵手，然其時英首相邱吉爾不信任達朗上將之言，卒將在阿藍港中之法艦船如數擊沉，此後即爲我與曼特爾（按曼特爾在萊諾組閣時任內長，後於一九四四年六月巴黎解放時被人暗殺）二人受罪之期。我等均被控「濫用公款」，然彼等皆未能證實我等有罪，即被監禁獄中，直至六月二十三日達朗海軍上將（按達朗在法國與德作戰時，曾爲法國海軍總司令，後至貝常與德國訂立停戰協定時，曾任爲海軍部長）曾熱烈宜稱，「若法國投降，我必親赴海頒頒令法國　船決不落敵手，」我相信萊議確不食言」。當時貝常極力反對在汰國北部邊增築造防禦工程，此　違反昔日福煦及魏剛兩將軍之戰策，貝當竟以戰事部長之資格，在法國北部僅作一些無關緊要之瑣事，　封「兩年軍役制」表示極力反對，在一九四○年之二五中旬渠會聲稱，「不到五個月汝等將均告戰敗，同時法國將建立獨裁政制」。在一九四○年五月三十日渠又聲稱，「在五月初之第二星期，全法人民將極度需要我」。」在萊諾發表供詞之際，貝當元首靜坐椅中，而白起　　，兩手輕拍椅上之靠手，約歷三小時，庭上與週二審訊時極端相反，空氣寂靜，萊諾之一言一語均極淸晰，審詢休息四十分種後再開始。萊諾又供稱，「貝當之第一項罪，即爲傾覆法共和國，蓋法國之戰敗，完全因爲國會當局時均受貝當之欺職，故無人再較貝當對我法國民更爲有害」。萊諾略作停頓後，又繼續供稱，如何德國突進法國時政府遷至都爾，及後由包道克斯與貝常將英國拍至法國要求將法艦船轉移至英國軍港內之電報，秘密收藏，不向國會宣讀。最後萊諾作結東謂，「在德國人之一片稱贊聲中，貝當步入敗壊名譽之歧途中」。審訊在下午六時四十五分又吿中止。</p>

<h3>上半年度决算盈餘</h3>
<p>本市各銀行錢莊業務今年上半年度決算，均獲有盈餘，較去年下半年度營業更爲繁盛，惟一般穩健派行莊則多屬平庸。據業中談　：此種情形非金融業光明之途，蓋物資交流欠暢時期，工商業頗受相當影響，加以物價非合理飛騰暴漲，人財購買力日見萎縮，工商業受此兩車影　，以致與銀錢業往來業務退落，是以銀錢業除正當工商往來商務外，爲求維持業務計，不得不　本逐末，經營投機放　及其他押放貼現或囤積等。</p>

<h3>積財莫如積德　爲已何如爲公</h3>
<p>暴發戶與助學芝念</p>
<p>近來上海屢經空　，死傷頗多，因此一般人心理上都起了變化，人生觀也轉變了。譬如平日性情暴戾的，變爲溫柔；行爲惡劣的。　邪歸正；向來吝嗇的，也變爲慷慨豪爽了。昨天遇到一位爭逐戰時暴利的勝利者——暴發戶，他在五六年中，投機囤積，獲暴利何止數十萬萬，平時重私利，忘公益，只知有己，不知有人，對社會事業，漢不關心，正是猶太人的作風。近來空　頻繁，他身歷其境，飽受處驚，親口對我設：「海上本是安樂窩，竟然風　變色，晴天　歷，把市民嚇得魂不附體，照此演變，人　直不及草芥，功名富貴，能有何用？生命豺產，有何保障？算了吧，積財莫如　德·爲己何如爲公。報上勸募救災，助學，我打算多捐幾文，不必爲子孫着想，就算为自已消災；言下不勝　　！」</p>
<p>我所以把他一番話　　下來，無非奉勸大家耍看透人生觀，痛改過去私而忘公，一手不拔的作風，「舉一反三」，　吿一般富翁。都作如是想，那未救助學的基金，不難達到預期的目標，而捐　的紀錄，　有節節上昇的希望。</p>

<h3>自立</h3>
<p>— 夏俄</p>
<p>拿起弟弟的成績畢來，他不禁對着那一排八九十分的數字發愁了。</p>
<p>「哥哥，你看我的成　可以得到叔　獎學金嗎？」弟弟的削瘦的小險上放射着歡喜的光彩。</p>
<p>弟弟的問使他記假半年前答應下的話來：「只要弟弟用功，能够得到叔蘋獎學金，我一定能給他　續上學。」</p>
<p>他沒有回答弟弟，他的眼睛有點發花，彷彿間　得這張成績單就是扯自己在高中裘面的了。</p>
<p>也是這末樣好的分數，也是在學校　被光生　爲好學生，也是被父親許過我只要他成績優吳，　證可以使他讀大學，然而結果呢？在父親去　失了萊後，他不得不在高中　沒有畢業就跳出來拂上了生活的担子。</p>
<p>「讀書讀得好，有什麼用處呢！」他忽然憤憤地把弟弟的成積單擇在地上。</p>
<p>弟弟的泛着喜色的臉轉成了靑白，他趕忙把那張會在千餘個同學的堂　中從　長手裏接過來的成績單抬了起來，好似感到一種　辱地氣遭：「你爲什麼把它拌在地上？是不是氣憤找的成續比你好？」</p>
<p>坐在旁邊的媽，驚奇地看了看他，又哄着弟弟道：「你莫和你哥哥吵，他讀書時的成績也並不比你差點呢。」</p>
<p>過了一會，又埋怨着他：「你也不應該對弟弟這樣呀。弟弟書讀得好，做哥哥的也要誇　幾句才對。」</p>
<p>他心裘透過一陣難堪的自責，他知道對於兒童的自尊心的　殺與好勝心的克　是一種非過，他知道在弟弟的純眞的心田上不曾印上「讀書沒有用」幾個字，而一定以爲讀書是一種最該認眞的事。每天埋頭用功，不去玩耍，加上營養的不足，他是顯得比別的孩子憔悴瘦弱多了。這是爲了什麼？還不是爲了幼稚的童心早染上了生活的愁苦，懂得不努力讀書，就沒有再進學校的希望，就不能再滿足他氏求知慾了嗎？</p>
<p>——弟弟是無辜的，我不該把自己所體驗到的苦痛移　到他身上去。——他深深自語着。他用友愛的眼看着弟弟，弟弟怔在那裏，眼裏含着涙水。</p>
<p>「媽，你看見別人家嗎？　　　考了第二名，他爸就喜歡得很，買了許多魚肉給他吃呢！我却：……」弟弟　着嘴咕　着。瞭解到人世的不平，他有點悲憤了。</p>
<p>這時睡在床上的爸又咯支略支地翻了個身低低呷吟着，似乎已經聽見了地們的談話。</p>
<p>他看了看爸底　黃的險，皺着眉頭對弟弟道：「你要曉得，現在不光是學費問題了，現在是吃飯的問題！你上學雖不出學費，但還是要在家吃飯的，這就不行！現在是耍你目己去尋飯吃的時候了！」他一個字一個字咬緊着說，一聲聲打在他的心坎上比打在弟弟心上還要沉車。</p>
<p>「叫找自己去尋飯吃？」弟弟的眼角抹上一重陰影，一那裏是我去尋飯吃的地方呢？像爸這末大年紀的人都不　，　輪到我嗎？」</p>
<p>「是的，你爸呵，……你爸就是吃了續書的虧！……」爸的聲音幾乎是一種無力的嘶　：「讀畫使我　成了一個方正的人。我沒有財產，但我不會騙錢，不會發國難財，又不會　營吹拍。……我只曉得用力量用血　去隊錢，去賺可憐的　！……那些黑良心的僱主用極少的代價僱了我，榨完了我的血，便拋棄了我！……孩子，我被拋棄了，在這樣高的生活壓迫乏下，我不能再供給你們讀書甚至吃飯了！……孩子，我的血乾了，但爲了挨命，我還得叫你們把年靑的身子再送給別一批黑良心的僱主去榨你們的血！……」</p>
<p>爸長長的　了口　，衰弱的心臟因了　多的說話跳動得很急促。</p>
<p>「你怎麼哪？你好好的安靜　睡一睡吧。又來這樣睫想，」媽拍着爸的背脊，　音是　茫的，「孩子大了，我個是不會過份苦下去的，好日子就要到了。」</p>
<p>哥哥用手搭在弟弟的肩上，低而　地　　　：「弟弟，你聽話點吧。我昨天已經到黃老伯那　去過，他說有個朋友開銅錫店，現在倒需要一個學徒，我連忙把你　了地，他叫我兩天內聽回音，大　可以有把握。」</p>
<p>「要我做學徒去？」弟弟驚惶地拾起頭來，又不能支持地垂了下去。「我記得你從前駡過那些舊式商店的老板壓迫學徒，給他們在五年裏受盡打駡，地有不對，還要叫他們滾蛋。你說那些老板是把孩子造成奴隸的惡魔，將來非要給打倒不可。…………可是現在你要叫我去了！我害怕，……」</p>
<p>「那些話，我是說過的而且一直不曾忘記！但是，弟弟，那只是沒有力量的話啊！事實上，不僅是舊式商店的老板，就是儀我所在的所謂　式的公司裏的老板，也同樣用很霉的手段使我們成爲他們的不敢反抗的奴隸！弟弟，你想，那些話不都是對位置有了着落，那長久被　　所剝　的凄冷的心房又通過一綫希望的暖流。他不再想到那些倔主的橫　賢眼，歪斜的嘴臉了，他只幻覺到這聰明的小兒子已入了商　發達之門，在　沒有中了書本上的空談的毒的時候，擭得得了　錢求利的方法，不久便成爲一個能幹的市　，傢目前許多人一　，巧取到一　富足的豺奇了。</p>
<p>——是的，市儈，是不好　的名　，但它至少是比足以使人餓殲的一淸高」這兩個字來得强　！——地只得莫可奈何地這樣想下去。</p>
<p>弟靜靜地聽著，靜靜地想着，忽然　起成績單　，片片扯碎了。</p>
<p>「咦，這算什麼呢？」媽可惜地把那扯碎的在績單拾了起來。「你現在雖然做學徒去，但只是暫時的，以後還不是可以　書的嗎？這紙成績單便是以後升學的證件，爲什麼把它扯了呢？」</p>
<p>「媽，我不想再讀書了。窮人　了書，出來還是翻不了身，……」</p>
<p>哥哥呆立在那裏。他本想吿訴弟弟：窮人也是應該讀書的，但所讀的不僅是一本本的敎科書，而更要的是活的生活，活的書。讀了活的書，才知道怎樣去生活，去改造，——爲了自已，更爲了大衆！但　並沒有把這話告訴了弟弟，他知道在將來的生活中，弟弟能明瞭得比他更淸楚，也許那改造的信念比他更强！</p>
<p>「弟弟，你能够自立了，你比你的同學們有用！」他好久才迸出了這句</p>
<p>「我能夠立了，我知道。」弟弟閃着堅定的眼光，「先生說，苦裏才能鍛鍊出有用的人來，哥哥，不是嗎？吃苦對於我們有什麼關係呢？」</p>
<h3>生日</h3>
<p>— 陸汶</p>
<p>我到一位親戚家去拜壽。</p>
<p>一進門，我就嗅到屋子裏的空氣有點異樣。不說別的，一點不像有人過生日的樣子，臘燭，壽字香，什麼都沒有，除我以外，也沒有第二個客人。</p>
<p>「恭喜恭喜。」我向主人說，並　拱一拱手，鞠了一個躬。</p>
<p>「你請坐。」主人淡淡地說。</p>
<p>壽公跟地平日一樣，並沒因爲過生日而改　了一點什麼，他正在生着氣，對着兩個女兒。</p>
<p>「　！……一天到晚，儘是這些什麼費，　　費，體操費……」</p>
<p>「體育費。」小的女兒小聲地糾正他。</p>
<p>「我知道。……」壽公大　喊着，臉轉過來朝我說：「現在這些學校　什麼東西，書還沒唸多少，錢倒是一天到晚來要，一會兒這個費，一會兒那個捐……」</p>
<p>「是，是。」我陪着</p>
<p>我知道這位長嚴的脾氣，他想到什麼就說，不顯忌別人的，就如這回，他明明知道我也在敎書，也應該在「什麼東西」之列。可是我知道他絲毫沒有指着和尙　賊禿的意思</p>
<p>「現在，」他繼續證下去：「現在又是什麼留額費，說是過期不繳，多一天就要罰一千塊，……這算是學校！」</p>
<p>「現在學畫也眞可觀。」我答非所問地說，打算報和空氣。</p>
<p>「可不是，說是四斗米，照今天市價，快要四十萬啦，兩個就得八十萬。不是開玩笑的，還了得</p>
<p>「其　數目嚇人，也不過八斗米。」他的太太，我的一個遠房姨每，似乎飽經世故。</p>
<p>「不過，喝！眼睛眶子倒不小。」那位先生的火轉到太太頭上：「可是我是一個一個賺來的，不是成把抓來的。在家裏什麼都不管，　享現成…」</p>
<p>「什麼儘享現成！柴呀米呀是誰忙的？一太太似乎也動了火。</p>
<p>「學費與豈有此理！」我說，這甚想　和空氣</p>
<p>「所以呀！」總算那位先生的氣平了下來：「這年頭，我眞不知道唸了書有什麼用，不瞞你說，要不是我是站在這個地位上，假如我不是一個吃銀行飯的，我眞想讓她們兩個孩子去做女工。……」</p>
<p>我陪着他笑一下：「您說笑話！」</p>
<p>那位主人却非常嚴肅地接下去：</p>
<p>「是眞的。不是說笑話。現在有的地方做工可以有三四斗米拿，三四斗米現在就是三四十萬！我現在也不過拿了十六七萬。撑着这麽一大家。所以我说，我是眞想这麽做！」</p>
<p>一面子朝那要放？說起來某人的女兒在做女工。」太太不知道是壓根兒不同意呢，还是大約爲了丈夫今天過生日，　　笑話，可以添一點欣喜的氣氛。要不然就是無意地接上這麼一句。</p>
<p>可是壽公部光起火來</p>
<p>「面子？這年頭　　到面子？不餓死就是好事了！」</p>
<p>說着，把正在搖著的一把摺扇重重地朝桌上一丟：「拍！」</p>
<p>「過生日也　個吉利好不好？」太太低聲地說：「並且，　有客人在這裏。」</p>
<p>「您見外。」我乾笑　聲：「這算什麼客人。」</p>
<p>「客人有什麼關係？」　公還是那付神氣：「自己親戚，客氣什麼？說眞的，老姪，你是知道我脾氣的，打腫臉充胖子的事我眞不高興，可是你姨媽挺喜歡這一套，一天到晚就在講究而子。弄得外强中乾。」</p>
<p>「這是人情世故，什麼講究不講究。」太太提出抗議。</p>
<p>我臉上感到一陣熱，汗珠冒了出來，我手足無措，不知道該怎樣來打破這僵局，眞想不到來拜壽碰到這麼一個過生日塲面</p>
<p>這國，姨夫可沒生氣一，也沒發牢騷，只是嘆口氣：</p>
<p>「人情世故，我要是早就習慣這一套，也不致於到今天還是在這個位置上。十年來，　着多少人飛黃勝　……」</p>
<p>「別再說這些喪氣話了好不好？維善年紀靑靑的，你儘跟他說這些話。」女主人打　他：「吃飯吧。」</p>
<p>「好吧。不過這也無所謂是喪氣話，這是實情。」絕算他停住了口：「酒有嗎？維善陪我喝兩杯，我好久沒碰過杯子了。」</p>
<p>吃酒時候，那位壽公還是不斷的勞叨，—其寶，說嘮叨眞是罪過的，我們有誰能够厭惡一個人的從重重的生活榨壓下發出來的呻吟？</p>
<p>姨母預備了一點菜。也許是有我在座，不便發作，我只看見姨父皺了一下眉，當他朝桌上掃了一眼，發見有了幾碗葷菜的時候。</p>
<p>我不知道說什麼話好。姨父一直在用筷翻動一碗素菜，像在找尋什麼東西，還不時煩惱地趕走停留在　上的蒼蠅。兩個表妹大概爲了留額金碰了釘子，垂頭喪氣，只顧低着頭吃飯。</p>
<p>電燈還沒有亮，屋子要　　的。</p>
<p>姨母想要打破難堪的空氣，竭力　做自然地笑着：</p>
<p>「眞怠慢。维善难得上我們吃飯，並且，今天還是專誠拜　來的，我們運菜也沒有。」</p>
<p>「說哪裏話，姨母。」我說，聽得見自己的毫强的笑聲：「是應該來拜壽的。」</p>
<p>「其實生日有什麼道理？」姨父說：「大可不必這麼忙來去，至於有些人做生日大辦酒席，更是多餘。」</p>
<p>姨父自始至終就沒笑過一下，說實話，誰又　的想笑呢？這年頭，難道就果眞有這麼許多可笑的事情？</p>
<p>「少喝點酒吧。」姨母向姨父看了一眼，並旦者了一下桌子上的菜。我知道，她的意思是再喝下去等會吃飯時候菜要沒有了。</p>
<p>「不喝也罷。」姨父放下杯子，向我說：「我原想借酒　愁，不想到酒入愁腸愁更愁了，哈。」</p>
<p>他苦笑了一聲，這是我所看見的在他生日那天的第一個笑。</p>
<p>電燈還沒有亮。</p>
<h3>莫再留戀了</h3>
<p>— 張孟昭</p>
<p>上海，已不是冒險家的樂園了！</p>
<p>黑夜白晝的恐怖，使你的腦神经震蕩一生命沒有保陣！</p>
<p>但是，也許你竟淸酵一時。吼聲過後，你又僮憬到拾金之夢！股票·地產·囤貨·洋房·汽車·三輪車·歌合舞榭……多舒適啊！何忍割　？</p>
<p>但，血肉橫飛！沙蟲浩刧的畫面，你，竟不動心？竟不膽寒？</p>
<p>朋友！莫再留　了！荷起着勢勇，大踏步回歸敵鄉吧！</p>
<p>上海！已不是冒險家的　國了！</p>
<h3>再會吧！上海</h3>
<p>— 廣伯</p>
<p>明天一早，我們就要離開此地已經住過十　年，而又有了一點根底的上海了。道次全冢的離滬，唯一的原因及目的，當然也是屬於「疏散」這一行動。其實在本市除了極少數必需居留的人以外，每個市民都有實行疏散的必要。可是大多數的人都還沒有下這個決心。他們是不願意疏散的嗎？其實每個人都如道，自己的身體是肉做的，碰不了彈片；而旦犠甡了也沒有個名稱可以說是「殉」甚麼的。他們都是一羣「性命我所欲也，身外之財亦我所欲也」的人們。</p>
<p>比如我的哥哥，「疏敎，疏散：我現在的　業怎麼辦呢？」的嚷着。我說：「事業，事業，沙漠上的石塔。我想，沒有一個人敢子保險在此時期中所有的財富，能夠安安全全地移到下們時期，（新時代）。你是主張在戰　中立業的，我是志願在將來保開發我的前程的」</p>
<p>有妙子，正像現在一般的少奶奶個一樣，沒有　從　道　，而又沒有正確的新思想。她說：「所有的東西（當然指衣服…）又不能冬帮，現在鄉下壞人又多！」我說：「給壞人拿去，總比炸壞來得還仁人受物些。」她說：</p>
<p>「你又從何知遭一定會被炸呢？」我說：「幾萬號中之一的香濱藥，嫂子不是曾抱着絕大希望想中的嗎？而一下來就是十幾個的炸彈，又如何知道他會全不中呢？」二哥即說：「現在馬上就離開上海不太早嗎？」我說：「由本月十七·八號及二十四日被　犧牲的同胞看起來還太遲呢。假使我們今　被炸，即明早離滬，亦屬於太慢了呢。」</p>
<p>新近有了女友的三哥更留　滬地。他說：「死就死，人本來要死一次的。」我說：「我跟你一樣　沒有對社會，國家做過事，這樣的犠牲是對不起社會，人類的！」</p>
<p>我們的一家，經過我一番的勸導，大家的意志才統一起來。這次我看到的，雖不能一概而論，却有一　：一·人是荀安並只圖維持現狀的弱者，二·現在的家庭關結力本是一　散沙的。同時關於疏散所輕騐到的是，一家人中倘有一個人覺悟　做，他便應該，極力主張，必能推動全家力行的。因爲每個人的內心，生命總是要的，而炸彈當然也是怕的。</p>
<p>所以希望一　中先覺者，能果　地主張一下，十個有人決心，也許就有十家疏散。並希望從明天起你們也一家一家離開這有　時有被炸可能的上海。</p>
<p>再會吧！</p>

<h3>The Authorities are Considering Food Policy Measures as the New Harvest Season Approaches: Procurement Agencies Still Divided Between Military and Civilian Needs</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency) – In early June, the National Government resolutely abolished the original restrictions on the movement of rice in order to stabilize the rice supply and people's food security, and allowed free transportation and sales. At the same time, Allied military and political authorities also sincerely assisted by ceasing to purchase military rice. Since then, rice prices in Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places have stabilized somewhat, which was essential during this lean period. However, these measures were temporary in nature. As the new harvest season approaches, the authorities are considering future food policy measures. It is rumored that the principle of regional procurement will remain, and the procurement agencies will still be divided between military and civilian needs. The people of the country are deeply concerned about this. The main reasons why previous food policy measures failed to achieve the expected results were the unsound personnel system, the lack of unified laws and regulations, and, most importantly, the fundamental disorder and disarray in the procurement system and distribution agencies, which prevented unified procurement, distribution, and operation. Therefore, the people sincerely hope that the authorities will carefully examine past advantages and disadvantages and carefully consider future policies to avoid repeating past mistakes.</p>
<h3>Posthumous Awards for Brave Warriors Killed in Action in the East Asian War: Colonel Mori Katsura and Others Honored; Announced by the Decoration Bureau and the Ministry of the Army</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) – On the 26th, His Imperial Majesty the Emperor posthumously awarded honors to those who died in action in the 31st Great East Asian War related to the Army. This undertaking was conducted by the Decoration Bureau and concerned individuals who fought bravely on the Chinese mainland and in the Southwest Pacific after the outbreak of the Great East Asian War and ultimately sacrificed their lives for the country, including military personnel and civilians attached to units in Manchuria and the mainland. Among them, one hundred and fifty individuals, including bomber unit commander Colonel Mori Katsura, who was awarded the Special Service Merit Class A for his exceptional military achievements, participated in aerial operations multiple times and established distinguished military exploits. He unfortunately died in action on August 3 last year during an attack on the Ankang airfield in Shaanxi Province. This group of distinguished individuals also includes eighty-seven individuals, including Major Takahashi Suemasu, who rammed an enemy warship off the coast of Taiwan.</p>
<h3>General Okamura's Statement Acknowledged by American Commentator</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch – General Okamura, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Army in China, made a statement to a group of Chinese reporters on the 9th of this month stating that "it will take approximately two years for the Japanese army to completely withdraw with its weapons." This statement has attracted considerable attention both domestically and internationally. According to a broadcast from San Francisco, the well-known American military commentator Lawrence wrote in the New York Daily News that General Okamura's statement that it would take two years for the Japanese army to withdraw from China is indeed not a lie. This is because there are very few ships available now. Even if the million or more Japanese troops were not attacked by American forces, it would be impossible to assist in the defense of Japan and return home, even with the use of ships. General Okamura's conclusion is that "it is better for the Japanese army not to withdraw." Regardless of whether this commentary is related to some kind of peace movement, various parties here almost unanimously believe that it is a militarily correct measure.</p>
<h3>Guangdong and Macau Establish Trade Measures</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 25th (Central News Agency) – The exchange of goods between this province and Macau has been calculated based on the amount of imports and exports approved for Hong Kong trade. As Macau currently lacks specialized organizations or merchants responsible for handling export matters, the exchange of goods between the province and Macau has not developed smoothly. Recently, the authorities of both Guangdong and Macau have agreed on several interim measures for Guangdong-Macau trade and have recently started soliciting merchants to engage in business.</p>
<h3>Fifty Enemy Planes Shot Down in Attacks on Japan Yesterday and the Day Before; Minor Damage from Shelling of Cape Irago</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) – Over two hundred enemy carrier-based aircraft continued to attack airfields and transportation facilities in the Tokaido region in small formations on the morning of the 25th, dropping small bombs and strafing with machine guns before retreating at around 9:00 AM. From the 24th to the morning of the 25th, the Japanese side shot down a total of fourteen enemy planes and destroyed thirty-six.</p>
<p>Osaka, 25th (Central News Agency) – Starting on the morning of the 25th, enemy planes, following yesterday’s pattern, continued to attack with small planes. Carrier-based planes from a mobile unit patrolling south of the Kii Channel were active off the coast of Yamaguchi Prefecture. From 5:00 AM to 6:30 AM this morning, two hundred and several dozen enemy small planes were active in Shikoku and the southern coast of Osaka. Starting around 9:00 AM, ninety more enemy planes intruded into the Tokai Military District from Shiga Prefecture, conducting operations in the Sea of Japan before retreating.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) – At around 2:00 AM on the 25th, approximately five enemy cruisers and destroyers shelled the area off Cape Irago for about twenty minutes before retreating. Damage to the Japanese side was light.</p>
<h3>Japanese Air Force Sinks Large Submarine</h3>
<p>Southern Front Line Base, 25th (Central News Agency) – On the morning of the 22nd, Japanese air units, while flying over the sea south of Ceram Island, discovered a large enemy submarine and immediately dropped bombs, sinking it.</p>
<h3>Armed Conflict Between Chongqing and Communist Forces in the Wei River Delta; Both Sides Massing Troops, Serious Situation</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Shanghai – According to information arriving here, the 59th Division of Hu Zongnan's army, which crossed the Jing River in central Shaanxi Province and continued to gather on the north bank, suddenly guarded the Yaoxian and Chunhua areas and launched an attack on the Yan'an army. At the same time, it challenged the Yan'an army defending Jingyang and Xingping. The Wei River delta and the Jing and Luo River areas have become fierce battlefields. Because the Chongqing army has American equipment, it is reported that the Yan'an army suffered considerable casualties as of the 23rd. A formal civil war has begun. Furthermore, the Chongqing army has stopped passenger train service on the entire Longhai Railway line and continues to transport troops from that direction, increasing its forces to nine divisions. On the other hand, Yan'an has also begun to mobilize the 18th Group Army from the Jicha Border Region, and the situation is gradually deteriorating.</p>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Shanghai – According to a New China News Agency dispatch from Yan'an on the 23rd, on the 21st, the 59th Division of the Chongqing army suddenly launched a fierce artillery attack on Yetaishan in Chunyao County, the garrison area of the Communist army in the Guanzhong District of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. The Communist army, adhering to the principle of defending its positions, has not yet launched a counterattack. The fighting had not stopped as of the 23rd. In response, the Yan'an side believes that the Chongqing authorities have launched a large-scale attack on the border region and is extremely angry. On the 23rd, in the name of Zhu De and Peng Dehuai, the Commander-in-Chief and Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the 18th Group Army, a telegram was sent to Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, and Hu Zongnan, Commander of the First War Zone in Xi'an, demanding a halt to this attack. According to the New China News Agency, the full text of the telegram is as follows: "According to reports from the Guanzhong Sub-district of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, a sudden change has occurred in Xi'an in the past week. Anti-communist voices are rampant, and the majority of troops are gradually moving from the anti-Japanese front line in the area of Shaan County and Lingbao. Commercial transportation on the Longhai Railway has been suspended, and troops are being transported day and night. Nine divisions—the 1st Division of the 1st Army, the 7th Division of the 3rd Army, the Provisional 26th Division of the 7th Army, the 1st Reserve Division and 3rd Reserve Division of the 16th Army, the 52nd Division of the 36th Army, the 59th Division, the 37th Provisional Division and the 165th Division of the 80th Army—have been deployed in the areas of Tongguan, Yaoxian, Jingyang, Qianxian, and Xingping, with the slogans of 'Anti-communism First, Anti-Japanese Second,' to attack the border region, attempting to slaughter Communists. On July 21, the 59th Division suddenly attacked the Yetaishan area in Yaoxian, in our border region. Fierce fighting has been ongoing for three days, with no sign of stopping. Considering that a major enemy is currently present, the fate of the nation is related to the solidarity of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. At a time when the Allied forces are moving from east to west, and our country is adjusting internally to cooperate with the Allied forces in a counterattack against the enemy, we are suddenly shocked by the alarm of civil war. These troops have no intention other than defending their territory. We hereby send this telegram in the hope of stopping this and await a reply."</p>
<p>According to the Communist side's statement, there have been 106 attacks by the Chongqing army involving more than 1,000 troops each against the Communist army from June of last year to May of this year. Entering this year, frequent attacks occurred in Wangjiang County in Anhui Province, the western part of Zhejiang Province, and other locations. This time, the Chongqing army's attack on the Communist army, at a location 200 kilometers from Yan'an, constitutes a direct attack on the Communist Party's base in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, and the Communist side attaches great importance to the situation.</p>
<h3>Manchurian Concordia Association Holds National Joint Council Meeting</h3>
<p>Xinjing, 25th (Central News Agency) – The 13th National Joint Council Meeting of the Manchurian Concordia Association will be held in Xinjing over five days, starting on the 25th. The focus of the meeting will be on the first agenda item, namely, the spiritual aspects of promoting public opinion and boosting morale, the self-discipline of Concordia Association members and issues related to maintaining their prestige, and the practice of integrating officials and civilians, rewarding merit and punishing demerit, and purging corrupt officials. The issue of people's self-defense organizations is also an urgent matter. The second most important agenda item is the labor issue, a key topic related to people's livelihoods, including the rationalization of designated mobilization, the improvement of labor management, and the establishment of a family support system.</p>
<h3>Heavy Rain on the Burmese Front, Fighting Continues; US Changes Commander of India-Burma Air Force</h3>
<p>Burmese Front Line Base, 25th (Central News Agency) – The enemy suffered setbacks in the recent Japanese counterattack on the Sitang River. It appears that they have now completed the reorganization of their front line. The counterattacks around the Sitang River are gradually becoming stronger. Although there is torrential rain on the front lines, the enemy army, under the cover of a large number of fighter planes, is constantly attacking Japanese positions. The Japanese army in the area is intercepting the enemy in front of the positions, completely thwarting their attempts.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 25th (Central News Agency) – According to dispatches from Calcutta, Southeast Asia Command announced on the 23rd that Major General Hunter has succeeded Lieutenant General Stratemeyer as the commander of the U.S. Air Force in India and Burma. Lieutenant General Stratemeyer has relinquished his concurrent position and will now focus on his role as commander of the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing. Major General Hunter also serves concurrently as commander of the U.S. Air Force in the India-Burma theater.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency) – Southeast Asia Command announced on the 24th as follows: The Japanese army is advancing from the Pegu Yoma hills towards the Sitang River, continuing to attack British-Indian forces on the 123-kilometer road between Taungoo and Nyaungkharshaik.</p>

<h3>Various Aspects of Wujiang</h3>
<p>— Straightforward</p>
<p>Anyone familiar with the situation in Jiangsu generally knows that there is a peculiar phenomenon in the towns of Wujiang. That is, the towns are better than the county seat, and the towns surpass the urban area in terms of market conditions and wealth.</p>
<h3>Rich Towns, Poor County</h3>
<p>Wujiang is a first-class county in Jiangsu Province, with jurisdiction over nine districts and more than one hundred townships. Logically, the market conditions in the county seat should be quite prosperous, but this is not the case. Apart from North Tang Street, which has a few small shops, only the markets outside the East Gate and North Gate are relatively lively, but they are nothing more than general merchandise stores and traditional Chinese medicine shops. The reasons for this can be divided into two categories: First, most of the towns under its jurisdiction are too rich. For example, the four major towns of Shengze, Zhenze, Tongli, and Pingwang are each richer than the county seat, and the villagers do not need to come to the city to purchase goods. Second, it is too close to Suzhou, only thirty-six miles away. When the Sujia Road was open, it only took half an hour to reach. If residents need anything, they can go to Suzhou to buy it. Even now that the Sujia Road is closed, there are still wooden engine boats on the waterways, and rickshaws and cars on the land routes, so the county seat's urban landscape has never prospered.</p>
<h3>Decline of the Silk Industry</h3>
<p>Wujiang and its affiliated towns have always been famous for producing silk, especially Shengze and Zhenze, which are the best in the county. Anyone who pays a little attention to domestic products will have heard of "Shengze cloth" and "Qili silk," which are special products of this county. In addition to Shengze and Zhenze, Yanmu, Pingwang, and other towns also produce a large amount of silk, so there are many mulberry fields in the area, and there are quite a few silkworm farmers who depend on it for a living. Speaking of this year's spring silkworms, it is very miserable. Because of the scarcity of silkworm eggs this year (the reason for the scarcity is that the silkworm eggs coming from the east this year were particularly few, and the domestic silkworm egg production farms, based on the lessons learned from the dumping of silkworm eggs from the east last year, produced even fewer eggs this year, so a shortage of silkworm eggs was formed), the price of silkworm eggs also skyrocketed. For example, Shouxing brand eggs were even raised to over 10,000 in some places. In the last few days, as long as silkworm farmers had eggs, even the miscellaneous brands that were ignored last year were treated as rare commodities this year. Even so, the shortage of silkworm eggs is an undeniable fact, and the mulberry fields are also overabundant. When silkworms first started hatching, mulberry leaves were 2,000 yuan per dan (unit of weight), but when the silkworm season was coming to an end, the price even dropped to 1,000 yuan per dan, and no one cared about them. This phenomenon is probably unprecedented in recent years!</p>
<p>Wujiang has fertile land, and a considerable amount of rice is also produced, so the results of this autumn rice procurement are quite good. Before the National Government issued the order to stop purchasing rice, the farmers were extremely distressed because the rice procurement was not limited to a certain number of times. With procurement going on three or four times… the farmers naturally became poorer day by day.</p>
<h3>Public Security Situation</h3>
<p>The area of Wujiang County is quite large, formed by the merger of the former Zhenze and Wujiang counties, divided into nine districts and more than one hundred townships. The district and township chiefs of each district and township are mostly very capable because they are directly related to the farmers. Of course, they can directly extract revenue from the farmers, without having to go around the bend. The three dou of rice can be obtained on time, without defaulting for several months like this. However, the affairs of the district office are also quite busy, such as building roads, dispatching laborers, and supplying firewood to various institutions, all of which are the responsibility of the district office. Some clerks in the district office act arrogantly and even beat up farmers after drinking and indulging in drugs. It is hoped that the county government will pay special attention when selecting local grass-roots administrative personnel.</p>
<p>The public security situation is also different from the past. Due to the difficulties of life and various exploitations, more and more people are gradually taking risks. Armed robberies can often be heard. For example, after Shengze Town was robbed last month, Tongli Town soon after had a daylight robbery and the murder of the manager of Houzhuang. And in the prosperous Chengtuanzhou outside the East Gate of Wujiang City, fifteen families were robbed in one night. However, this is just the beginning. If life cannot be improved and the people's minimum living needs cannot be met, no one dares to say what will happen in the future.</p>
<h3>Rampant Gambling</h3>
<p>Gambling is very prevalent in the urban and rural areas of Wujiang now, which is also a symbol that farmers' lives are depressed and cannot be vented. They know how dangerous gambling is, but they are holding onto the "drinking poison to quench thirst" to give a deep stimulation to nerves that have been oppressed for a long time. In addition, the promotion of the local special class is also one of the reasons. For example, when a small event such as a wedding or funeral occurs in the locality, they always set up a few so-called large tables, attracting a group of weak-willed people to flock to them. There are many who are ruined by this.</p>
<p>Rice straw ash is flying all over the streets of Wujiang. Such a large park is unattended, so that a bird-catching magpie that should be caught by children has lost all its tiles. But what is most inappropriate is that the firefighting equipment is imperfect. There is not a single repaired fire hydrant in the city. If there is a fire, is it not just watching it burn? It is hoped that the Wujiang County Government can do its best to improve this!</p>
<p>Wujiang's cultural aspect is terribly poor. Although there is a complete middle school, a rural normal school attached to the Jiangsu Provincial College of Education, and several elementary schools in the urban area, there are not many students, and there is not even one bookstore that sells magazines and books. From this, it can be seen what the cultural level of this county seat is. In terms of newspapers, there is only one Wujiang Public Newspaper (octavo), a ten-day publication, and what is published is also the resolutions of the county government. There is very little news.</p>
<p>The price of food is relatively low now. The price of rice is about 390,000, and wheat is about 170,000. Now the Jiangsu Provincial Government plans to use the abandoned Sujia Road to cultivate land to increase production. This is, of course, an excellent business, and it can be written when the date is coming.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Gold Prices and Commodity Prices</h3>
<p>In recent days, the skyrocketing of gold prices has become the focus of speculative capital. Because of the skyrocketing of gold prices, various commodity prices have also followed suit, posing a serious threat to the lives of ordinary citizens.</p>
<p>To curb the rise in commodity prices, we must first curb the skyrocketing of gold prices. The reasons for the skyrocketing of gold prices: First, it must be admitted that the rise in the issue price of gold securities in each period is a stimulus. Second, the rampant speculation and artificial manipulation. When we study the actual reasons for the skyrocketing of gold prices, the former seems to be the superficial reason, only triggering the motive, and the latter is the real cause, riding the tide and triggering such a climax. However, the relationship between the two is actually very close because the rise in the issue price of gold securities creates an opportunity for speculators. We must review this to curb the skyrocketing of gold prices.</p>
<p>There are various discussions about curbing the skyrocketing of gold prices. Some people believe that the future issuance of gold securities should also be considered. However, the original intention of issuing gold securities is to recover part of the reserve coupons, on the one hand, to reduce the development of currency inflation, and on the other hand, to be used as funds for purchasing materials, which is not controversial in principle. However, if it is done too hastily, it becomes a reason to promote the skyrocketing of gold prices, and the rise in commodity prices caused by the skyrocketing of gold prices actually exceeds the impact of currency inflation that can be reduced by the reserve coupons recovered by the gold securities. We believe that the gold securities system is an important creation of the monetary authorities, and the decision on the price of gold securities should be deeply researched. Future conversion must be premised on curbing the skyrocketing of gold prices.</p>
<p>Some people think that gold bullion can be suppressed with strong force. However, we now hope that the authorities can reasonably regulate gold prices rather than hope that the authorities will use administrative power. As the Continental New Daily argues, if normal gold bullion trading turns into black market trading due to suppression, then control will be even more difficult, and we firmly believe that this is the case. Moreover, the three principles proposed by the Continental New Daily can indeed be used as a reference for this decision-making, especially the provision on the difference in gold price fluctuations, which is more to the point.</p>
<p>As for the rise in commodity prices, of course, slowing down the trend of skyrocketing gold prices can slow down the rate of rise. However, it will never fall back just because the gold price stops skyrocketing. Moreover, the rise and fall of gold prices is the object of profit for a few speculators, while the rise and fall of commodity prices affects ordinary citizens widely. Therefore, although the main reason for this rise in commodity prices is the rise in gold prices, curbing the skyrocketing of gold prices is only one way to curb commodity prices, not a fundamental solution to flatten commodity prices.</p>
<p>If the skyrocketing of gold prices and the prices of daily necessities can be isolated by adopting economic policies, we naturally agree. However, if there is only the power to stimulate the rise in gold prices and no guarantee to prevent general commodity prices from being affected by gold prices, and there is no guarantee to isolate the link between gold prices and commodity prices, then the so-called "trying to draw a tiger but ending up with something resembling a dog," this kind of measure related to people's livelihood must not be experimental in nature.</p>
<p>In short, economic policy is not one-sided, it must be comprehensive. The policies on gold prices and general commodity prices should not only implement comprehensive control on price policies, but also coordinate with this in monetary policy to be effective for the entire people's livelihood issue. We hope that the Chinese and Japanese authorities will jointly pay attention to the implementation of wartime economic policies and must take into account the coordination of the national economy and cannot ignore the importance of the national economy.</p>
<h3>Principles for Dealing with the Gold Problem</h3>
<p>The price of gold is becoming increasingly expensive, almost without end. At the same time, the soaring gold price is inducing a general rise in commodity prices. From the standpoint of a wartime economy, this phenomenon cannot be ignored. Observing the commodity prices of the past ten days or so, when the gold price rose the most, it can be seen that in addition to rice, the gold price has dragged up other commodity prices, and at the same time, other commodity prices have also followed the gold price. Therefore, if this is left unattended in the future, solving the problem of commodity prices will become even more difficult. The reason for the soaring gold price is speculative activity. This is a fact that everyone has witnessed. Who is engaging in what kind of speculation? This question can be clearly understood from the facts disclosed in the gold market. Therefore, if the authorities are determined to suppress speculation in order to curb the gold price, it is very simple. However, we do not have high expectations for a policy that only uses suppression. The suppression of speculation may cause illicit transactions to shift to the black market. If the cause of speculation is not eliminated and a black market is forced into existence, it will be more difficult to control gold price fluctuations, and the adverse economic effects will be even greater. Although improper speculation should certainly be suppressed, it seems necessary to consider suppressing general transactions. Of course, the target of suppression should be speculative phenomena, but it is not easy to distinguish between speculation and legitimate transactions. If normal transactions are also suppressed, then the fundamental concept of selling gold vouchers is completely denied.</p>
<p>So, if we do not adopt a policy of strongly suppressing speculation, what kind of strategies can be used to curb speculative phenomena? Although there is more than one or two such methods, we strongly advocate the following three fundamental countermeasures: Strictly supervise the issuance of promissory notes, and if factually possible, realize the standardization of special promissory notes. Strictly inspect financial institutions and severely punish the release of speculative funds. Restrict gold bar transactions and stipulate the daily fluctuation margin. When this margin is exceeded, issue an order to suspend transactions. If the above conditions can be correctly implemented, speculative phenomena will naturally be curbed. The reason why speculation is rampant is due to the release of speculative funds. At the current stage, these funds cannot be obtained from anywhere other than financial institutions. Furthermore, even financial institutions cannot unlimitedly possess a large amount of funds. The problem lies in giving financial institutions an easy means of creating credit. Therefore, the issuance of promissory notes is self-evident. As for setting a margin limit for transactions and suspending transactions when this margin is exceeded, this is a method used by the stock exchange and can also be applied to gold bar transactions. If the various measures mentioned above can be implemented comprehensively, then gold bar speculation can be suppressed to a considerable extent.</p>
<p>Finally, we hope to crack down on speculation, and we do not want to lag behind others, but we must guard against the possibility that forced crackdowns will cause gold bar transactions to turn into a black market. At the same time, during crackdowns, there is often a regrettable phenomenon of only catching small fish while letting the big fish get away. Although it is also important to pay attention to the fact that most of those who appear on the surface of speculation are small fish, catching the big fish can be done by simply investigating the truth of the few financial capitalists who currently own the most gold bars. However, in view of various circumstances, it is hoped that this action will be carried out with great caution. Therefore, the possible implementation and efficient methods are the above three principles. We sincerely hope that the Chinese and Japanese authorities can start from the above perspectives and actively deal with the entire problem (Translated from the "Continental News," July 25).</p>
<h3>All Sectors in Suzhou Raise Donations to Relieve Disaster-Stricken Citizens in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Suzhou, July 25 (Central News Agency) - Enemy planes blindly bombed the Shanghai area, killing and injuring innocent civilians. This inhumane act is deeply dissatisfying here. Ren Xiping, General Manager of the Jiangsu Provincial Bank, and several leaders of the local financial and industrial sectors, have now launched a campaign to raise donations from the citizens of this city. They have already raised more than 50 million yuan and will send it to the Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association within the next few days to express their relief for the citizens who have suffered from the air raids.</p>
<h3>Air Defense Drills Held in Suzhou Provincial Capital</h3>
<p>Suzhou, July 25 (Central News Agency) - The Suzhou Provincial Air Defense Command, considering that the war is becoming increasingly fierce and that rear cities are at risk of air raids at any time, has specifically scheduled air defense exercises for the evenings of the 24th and 26th of this month to arouse public awareness of air defense and strictly implement lighting control.</p>
<h3>Road Construction Actively Underway</h3>
<p>Suzhou, July 25 (Central News Agency) - Under the leadership of the General Construction Engineering Office, the various road construction projects in this province are progressing very rapidly. The Su-Dang and Su-Jia highways have already been completed and all vehicle traffic has been restored. In addition, the surface of the Su-Hu highway within this province is expected to be completed by mid-August. Furthermore, the Su-Xi and other highways are currently actively preparing construction plans.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Provincial Government Takes Over Business Control Sub-Committee</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, July 25 (Central News Agency Chang) - The Guangdong Sub-Committee of the National Business Control Association was ordered to be abolished recently. On the 24th, the provincial government sent personnel to take over. Matters related to commercial control, transportation permits, etc., handled by the association are all merged into the Fourth Section of the Construction Department.</p>
<h3>Location for the Trial of German and Italian War Criminals</h3>
<p>Decided to be in Nuremberg</p>
<p>July 15 (Central News Agency) - According to news from London: Since the Three-Power Conference, Germany is now doing a second job of maintaining security, as war criminals from Germany and Italy may be tried in a certain area of Germany. According to the New York Times published in London, the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France have drafted regulations on the trial procedures for war criminals a few days ago. All representatives unanimously agreed that the trial should be held in Germany, and Nuremberg has actually been designated as the location for the trial. If the trial is indeed held in Nuremberg, then in other words, it will be held within the jurisdiction of the U.S. Third Military District. Therefore, senior U.S. military commanders have asked Yorkson and others to provide proper methods for maintaining security to prevent Nazi elements and anti-Nazi elements from taking the opportunity to cause trouble.</p>
<h3>Mussolini's Eldest Son Detained in Concentration Camp</h3>
<p>Hundred Lun, July 25 (Central News Agency) - According to a Swiss telegram citing news from the Swiss-Italian border: Vittorio Mussolini, the eldest son of former Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, surrendered to the Allied forces a few days ago and is currently being held in a certain concentration camp.</p>
<h3>The Three-Power Conference and the East Asian Situation - The United States Eagerly Seeks a Solution to the War Against Japan</h3>
<p>Tokyo, July 25 (Central News Agency) - Since President Truman took office, the United States has changed Roosevelt's dictatorial tendencies, maintained close ties with Congress, and replaced key government officials, demonstrating unexpected political skill. Therefore, domestically, his steady hand is even better than that of the late President Roosevelt. What is even more noteworthy is that although the United States has been at war for four years, the domestic situation is generally stable, and the people are proudly confident of victory in the future. However, regarding the war against Japan, all parties have recently hoped for an early end. Truman and other government officials also hold this urgent hope, which has gradually formed a kind of anxiety. The clouds of war in the world have come to an end with the surrender of Germany, and Europe has entered the stage of post-war cleaning. However, in East Asia, a deadly battle is still being fought with Japan, forcing the United States to continue bleeding, which is a major obstacle to the post-war world policy that the United States is concerned about day and night. Therefore, from the perspective of the United States, in order to catch up with the post-war policies of the Soviet Union and other European countries and not fall behind, and to seize the reins of world politics with the current favorable position, it is an urgent task to quickly end the war against Japan. Looking at the recent foreign telegrams, it is not difficult for us to discover the United States' peace offensive against Japan. However, this is a vicious American-style means with strategic intentions. The United States insists on unconditional surrender, and it is very obvious that it will launch a large-scale aggression in East Asia in both political and military operations. It is reported that the Three-Power Conference held in Potsdam, a suburb of Berlin, raised the discussion of the East Asian issue in the first meeting. Another trend related to East Asian political issues is the six Stalin-Song Ziwen talks, which were temporarily suspended due to the holding of the Three-Power Conference. What is noteworthy is that on the eve of Song Ziwen's visit to the Soviet Union, he extensively sought the United States' views on the East Asian issue. Although the Stalin-Song Ziwen talks were formally a meeting between the Soviet Union and Chongqing, they were actually a preparatory meeting between the United States and the Soviet Union on the East Asian issue. Song Ziwen can be called the spokesperson for the United States. Therefore, although the talks were held six times, the official announcement still stated that no resolution had been reached. From this judgment, it can be known that negotiations on the East Asian issue between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union are difficult to resolve simply. However, regardless of whether the Three-Power Conference has reached any kind of understanding, from Japan's perspective, it cannot but be concerned about the discussion of the East Asian issue by the three countries. In short, the United States' recent political and military offensives against Japan are extremely active. However, this may also be a strategy of the United States, and it is an expression of the enemy's negligence. According to people here, Japan's only way out in the future is to destroy the United States' offensive and advance the belief in completing the war.</p>
<h3>Japanese Diplomacy Deserves Special Attention</h3>
<p>Tokyo, July 25 (Central News Agency) - The "Tokyo Shimbun" published an article on the 25th entitled "One Factor of Japanese Diplomacy That Deserves Special Attention," stating that the main figure in the Three-Power Conference is Stalin, and this point should be noted. The Soviet Union's prominent international position has now been noted by the world. After the end of the European war, those who went to visit the Kremlin came one after another. Stalin's position in today's world politics is no less than that of Wilson in the middle of the last European war. After the end of the European war, the common goal of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union to defeat Germany was achieved. The Soviet Union is no longer an ally moving towards a common goal, but is regarded as an ally that adjusts and resolves interests. The Soviet Union has now been freed from the burden of war and can freely exert its skills. On the contrary, the United States and Britain still have the difficult task of the war against Japan, so they have to make concessions to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's position in the Three-Power Conference is as described above. Therefore, the world in the future will be determined by Stalin's heart. This matter should be the most important factor for Japanese diplomacy today.</p>
<h3>The Inside Story of the China Problem is Complicated</h3>
<p>Lisbon, July 25 (Central News Agency) - With regard to the Three-Power Conference, the fact that the East Asian issue is also on the agenda is frequently transmitted by telegrams from the United States and Britain, but the content of this news seems to be conjecture. The theme of each report is related to the Soviet Union's policy toward China prepared by the Stalin-Song Ziwen talks, as well as the East Asian policies of Britain and the United States that are related to the Pacific war situation. However, how the complex political disputes within China and the mutual interests of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union will be adjusted does not seem to have been resolved. The main points of view are cited as follows: Lippmann of the United States, in the Herald Tribune, criticized the Yan'an forces that exist outside the Chongqing control circle, stating that to solve the China problem, it is extremely difficult to proceed without a clear understanding between the Soviet Union and China, or without recognition from the United States. Even in the form of a federal country, whether China can be unified is at risk of expanding from Outer Mongolia to the Yellow River. The United States and Britain hope to achieve the effect of preventing the southward movement of red forces in Song Ziwen's work in Moscow and have reported that the Song-Shi talks have established a certain foundation for an agreement. Lippmann also discussed this issue, assuming that an agreement has indeed been reached between Song and Shi, but questioned what kind of power Song Ziwen and the Chongqing regime have over the vast territory of China, and whether the United States has the ability to implement a general agreement. The diplomatic reporter of the "Daily Telegraph" remained silent on the East Asian issue of the Three-Power Conference. The newspaper only stated that the Three-Power Conference will discuss the issue of the Soviet Union's active participation in the current war situation.</p>
<h3>Churchill Returns Home - Potsdam Conference Adjourns - Results of British General Election to be Announced Today</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, July 25 (Central News Agency) - According to a Reuters telegram from Potsdam: After the meeting on the 24th, the Three-Power Conference immediately entered a state of adjournment, because British Prime Minister Churchill, accompanied by Foreign Secretary Eden and Attlee, returned to London on the 25th. After inspecting the results of the British general election on the 26th, they will return to Potsdam on the 27th. During this recess, the secretariat of the Three-Power Conference will prepare the agenda or prepare the report for the conclusion of the talks in order to cope with the resumption of the meeting.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, July 25 (Central News Agency) - According to a Reuters reporter: The news of who will be the next Prime Minister of Britain, Churchill or Attlee, will not be revealed until 4 pm on Thursday. Yesterday, the three heads of state in Potsdam held the last meeting, as the leaders of Britain will all return to London today. Political circles in London firmly believe that regardless of whether the Conservative Party or the Labour Party wins the election, Churchill and Attlee will still go to Berlin to continue the talks.</p>
<h3>American Aircraft Production</h3>
<p>Tokyo, July 25 (Central News Agency) - The enemy's aircraft production plan, formulated by the United States to deal with the Greater East Asia War, focuses on manufacturing B29 aircraft, which goes without saying. However, recently this policy has been changed to adopt a policy that emphasizes medium-sized bombers and fighter planes, which is noteworthy.</p>
<h3>Continued Report on Petain's Trial - Testimony of Former French Prime Minister Reynaud</h3>
<p>Hundred Lun, July 25 (Central News Agency) - According to news received here: Marshal Petain was retried yesterday under the charge of "harming the country and colluding with the enemy." The Paris District Court was filled with an atmosphere like a parliamentary debate. Reynaud, the former Prime Minister of France when Germany invaded Paris, stated in his confession of how France was defeated that he fundamentally believed in General Petain's patriotism in 1940, which was a fundamental mistake. The interest of the spectators in the court waned because Petain refused to answer various questions on Monday. However, there were still 1,000 armed military police stationed in front of the District Court.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the trial, Reynaud continued his testimony, which was interrupted the previous day, stating, "When General Petain was promoted to be the head of France, he issued a commission appointing the key members of the various departments. The name of Laval was not yet seen among them, although Laval was very close to Petain at the time. As for the armistice agreement, I did not learn about it until June 23. I recall that Admiral Darlan once stated that he would do his best to keep French ships in all ports out of enemy hands. However, British Prime Minister Churchill did not trust Admiral Darlan's words and eventually sank all the French ships in Alan Port. This was the beginning of the suffering of me and Mantell (Mantell was the Interior Minister when Reynaud formed the cabinet and was later assassinated in Paris in June 1944). We were all accused of 'misappropriating public funds,' but they failed to prove our guilt and were imprisoned until June 23. Admiral Darlan (Darlan was the commander-in-chief of the French Navy when France was at war with Germany. Later, when Bei Chang signed an armistice agreement with Germany, he served as the Minister of the Navy) enthusiastically declared, 'If France surrenders, I will personally go to the sea and issue an order that French ships will never fall into enemy hands.' I believe Lei Yi will certainly not break his promise." At that time, Petain strongly opposed increasing the construction of defense projects on the northern border of Tai Country. This violated the war strategy of Generals Foch and Weigang in the past. Petain, as the Minister of War, only did some insignificant trivial matters in northern France and strongly opposed the "two-year military service system." In mid-February 1940, he claimed, "In less than five months, you will all be defeated, and France will establish a dictatorship." On May 30, 1940, he claimed again, "In the second week of May, the entire French people will need me very much." During Reynaud's testimony, Marshal Petain sat quietly in his chair, standing up, lightly patting the armrests of the chair, for about three hours. The atmosphere in the court was extremely quiet, in stark contrast to the interrogation on Tuesday. Reynaud's every word was very clear. The interrogation was resumed after a 40-minute break. Reynaud also testified, "Petain's first crime was to subvert the French Republic. France's defeat was entirely because the congressional authorities were deceived by Petain, so no one was more harmful to the French people than Petain." After a slight pause, Reynaud continued to testify how the government moved to Tours when Germany invaded France, and how Baodoux and Bei Chang secretly hid the telegram from Britain to France requesting that French ships be transferred to British military ports without announcing it to Congress. Finally, Reynaud concluded, "Amid the German praise, Petain embarked on the road of ruining his reputation." The interrogation was suspended again at 6:45 pm.</p>

<h3>Issuance of Residence Permits in Zhabei and Other Districts to Begin Next Month - Baojia Office Convened Representatives from Various Districts Yesterday for Talks</h3>
<p>Since the issuance of residence permits began for residents in the urban area, the time has been nearly one month. Under the jurisdiction of the city police bureau, most of it has been completed. The authorities of the Baojia offices of Zhabei, Penglai, Yi, Xu Jia, and Dongchang six districts, which have newly entered the urban area, have also made secret plans and decided to start issuing residence permits from August 1. Yesterday (25th) at 4 pm, the general liaisons and the directors of the fourth sections of the police sub-bureaus of the six districts were summoned to a talk meeting at the seventh police bureau. Director Gu of the Baojia Office presided over the meeting in person, and Deputy Director Da Chuan, Deputy Directors Gang and Chen Jiufeng of the North and South District Offices, Section Chief Manjima of the Fourth Department, and the chief representative of the General Affairs Office attended the meeting. First, the director explained in detail all the procedures for issuing residence permits, and earnestly instructed that the principle of convenience for the people should be followed, strictly prohibiting deliberate obstruction, and providing detailed guidance to citizens. Then, Section Chief Manjima delivered a speech, expressing deep expectations. After that, a simple procedure was discussed to improve the method, and several points of attention for issuing residence permits were revised until the end at 6 pm.</p>
<h3>Silver and Money Industries Advance the Time for Check Clearing</h3>
<p>The check clearing time for the silver and money industries in this city was changed to 12 noon for the first clearing, starting from June 18, when the business hours were revised. The second clearing is at 4 pm. Now that the inter-industry check next-day clearing system is implemented on the 30th of this month, the check clearing time is wider, so it has been changed to 9 am every day. For those who are designated by each bank to go to the check clearing house and the industry market every day, penalties will be imposed for each error in the credit of the clearing difference calculation form or the first announcement, or for being late or absent for less than 10 minutes and already over 10 minutes, each error in the second report of the clearing difference calculation form, and errors in the turnaround application. This is because the business of the silver and money industries is very large, and we are trying to urge the industry to strictly abide by the regulations. As for the check clearing time for foreign banks' check clearing houses, it has not been revised at present. The checks cleared by the silver and money industries will still follow the time of 11 am every day, which has been in effect since July 3. Each bank will follow the Silver Union regulations at 10:30 am every day, and the treasury regulations will follow the treasury time before 2 pm every afternoon.</p>
<h3>Half-Year Settlement Surplus</h3>
<p>The half-year settlements of the various banks and money shops in this city have all yielded surpluses this year, and their business is more prosperous than in the second half of last year. However, most of the stable banks and money shops are mediocre. According to talks in the industry: This situation is not a bright path for the financial industry. During the period of unsmooth material exchange, the industry and commerce are quite affected. In addition, commodity prices are irrationally soaring and rising sharply, and people's purchasing power is shrinking day by day. Industry and commerce are affected by these two factors, resulting in a decline in business dealings with the silver and money industries. Therefore, in addition to the legitimate business dealings with industry and commerce, in order to maintain business, the silver and money industries have to abandon the fundamental and pursue the superficial, and engage in speculative lending and other pawn lending, discounting, or hoarding.</p>
<h3>Application Form for Transfer Lease License</h3>
<p>The transfer lease licenses for houses in the old one and eight districts of this city have expired for the first half of the year. The Finance Bureau of this city has stipulated that the application forms for the licenses for the second half of the year will be issued from yesterday (25th), notifying the second landlords in the two districts to go to the bureau to collect them. The form of the application form is the same as before, including the applicant's name, nationality, address, date of commencement of subletting, number of subletters, amount of quarterly housing donation, application date, etc., and must be submitted together with the summer housing donation ticket and the license fee to be paid to the License Office of the Bureau at 200 Fuzhou Road before September 7 of this year to verify and issue new licenses.</p>
<h3>Transportation Agency Plans to Establish a Branch in the Post Office</h3>
<p>The East Asia Transportation Corporation's Baxianqiao Branch, in order to facilitate the purchase of China Railway tickets by citizens in the southern district, in addition to selling passenger tickets in the Hua Zhong area at the original branch, will also sell passenger tickets and luggage tickets in the Hua Bei area at the Baxianqiao Post Office next door from today. In addition, the East Asia Transportation Corporation's head office plans to establish branches in the post offices in various districts of this city in order to facilitate citizens' evacuation and return to their hometowns, and is currently preparing for it.</p>
<h3>Regulations for the Appointment and Dismissal of Principals and Teachers of Primary and Secondary Schools</h3>
<p>The regulations for the appointment and dismissal of principals and teachers of primary and secondary schools in this city have not been revised since the incident, making it difficult to standardize the procedures for such appointments and dismissals. In particular, regarding the foreign schools and public primary and secondary schools in the former First and Eighth Districts, after the Education Bureau took over and converted them into municipal schools, these schools either followed past practices or were unclear about current laws and regulations, inevitably leading to many differences in the appointment and dismissal of principals and teachers. Recently, the Education Bureau, in order to enhance administrative efficiency and unify official decrees, has drafted four temporary regulations for the appointment and dismissal of "Municipal Primary School Teachers," "Municipal Secondary School Teachers," "Primary School Principals," and "Secondary School Principals," which have been submitted to the Municipal Government for approval and will be implemented from the date of the order. These four regulations must be followed not only by municipal and county schools but also by private primary and secondary schools.</p>
<h3>Barber Prices Double, Authorities Should Suppress Them</h3>
<p>Recently, barbers in this city have increased their prices without the approval of the authorities, with increases reaching more than double. It is hoped that the authorities responsible for price management will investigate and take measures to reduce prices, thereby alleviating the burden on citizens.</p>
<h3>Gold Certificate Market Quiet</h3>
<p>The gold certificate market remained quiet after opening yesterday, with investors also hesitant. As a result, prices fell by 1.08 million yuan compared to the previous day, with very few transactions. Matured bonds opened at 10.7 million yuan and closed at 10.7 million yuan, a decrease of 1.08 million yuan compared to the previous day, with a transaction volume of 5.</p>

<h3>Second Volleyball League Awards Ceremony Held Yesterday</h3>
<p>The third volleyball league, organized by the Municipal Sports Association, has been completed in full order. The awards ceremony was held yesterday afternoon at 6:00 PM, with two additional performances. The first was a match between the women's all-star team and the women's champion team, the Three Provinces Team. As a result, the Three Provinces Team, with better coordination, defeated the women's all-star team with scores of 21-14 and 21-18. After the match, the awards ceremony began.

Immediately afterward, a wonderful match between Zhongbei and the men's all-star team began. The men's all-star team took the first two games, but Zhongbei counterattacked and won back one game. Due to the lateness of the hour in the fourth game, it was not completed and dispersed.</p>
<h3>Accumulating Virtue is Better Than Accumulating Wealth; Serving the Public is Better Than Serving Oneself</h3>
<p>The Nouveau Riche and the Idea of Helping Students</p>
<p>Recently, Shanghai has been subjected to repeated bombings, resulting in numerous deaths and injuries. As a result, the psychology of the general public has changed, and their view of life has also been transformed. For example, those who were usually violent have become gentle; those who behaved poorly have turned from evil to good; and those who were always stingy have become generous and magnanimous. Yesterday, I met a victor in the pursuit of wartime profiteering—a nouveau riche. In the past five or six years, he speculated and hoarded goods, earning exorbitant profits of hundreds of thousands, or even millions. He usually valued private interests and forgot about public welfare, knowing only himself and not others, and was indifferent to social causes, just like the ways of the Jews. Recently, with the frequent bombings, he experienced them firsthand, suffering greatly from shock and fear. He said to me personally, "Shanghai was originally a comfortable home, but suddenly the wind and clouds have changed color, and clear skies have brought disasters, scaring the citizens out of their wits. If this continues, human lives will not even be worth as much as grass. What use are fame and wealth? What guarantee is there for life and property? Let's just say that accumulating virtue is better than accumulating wealth, and serving the public is better than serving oneself. The newspapers are appealing for donations to rescue victims and help students. I plan to donate a lot, not for the sake of my descendants, but just to eliminate disasters for myself." His words were filled with emotion!</p>
<p>The reason I have written down his words is to persuade everyone to see through the view of life, to thoroughly correct the past style of being selfish and forgetting the public, and of not pulling out a single hair to benefit others, and to use this as a "one-to-three" analogy to advise the general rich people to think the same way. If so, the fund for helping students in need will not be difficult to reach the expected goal, and there will be hope for a steady increase in donation records.</p>
<h3>Land Sold at Low Price to Donate to Student Aid Fund</h3>
<p>Dr. Tang Jiefu, the manufacturer of Kanghuo Stomach Powder, in order to help students who have dropped out of school, is willing to sell a plot of land, located at No. 3730 Huangzi, Luofahua District, measuring 1.96 mu, with two land certificates, at a reduced price, with half of the proceeds going to the Shenxin Two Newspapers Student Aid Fund. There is no shortage of wealthy individuals in Shanghai. Those who wish to purchase it should contact the Social Service Department of this newspaper.</p>
<h3>Ninth Session of the Readers' Student Aid Fund Special Fundraising Team</h3>
<p>The Honorary Team, Team 14, led by Han Zhicheng, raised 1 million yuan, bringing the total to 15 million yuan.</p>
<p>The Ordinary Team, Team 73, led by Tang Cheng Wude, raised 200,000 yuan; Team 74, led by Qin Benru, raised 100,000 yuan; Team 75, led by Wu Yu Ji, raised 100,000 yuan; Team 76, led by Wang Mingsan, raised 100,000 yuan; Team 77, the Xinda Qianzhuang Team, raised 100,000 yuan. The total raised by the teams above was 600,000 yuan, bringing the total collected to 15,435,500 yuan.</p>
<p>(Note) We are grateful to Mr. Han Zhicheng for organizing the Honorary Team and generously donating 1 million yuan. We extend our gratitude to Tang Chengde, Qin Benru, Wu Xingji, Wang Mingzhi, and the Xinda Qianzhuang for their donations. The Xinda Qianzhuang's response to the student aid movement, following the lead of the Juyu Qianzhuang, is deeply gratifying to us! We hope that the hundreds of bank branches in Shanghai will respond in kind, each organizing a team and donating generously, so that the student aid fund will have a bright future and thousands of poor students will have hope and be eternally grateful.</p>
<p>Yesterday, we received student aid donations from Ying Baige, Mr. Li, and Zong Zongyu, each donating 50,000 yuan. An anonymous donor (receipt number 9031) donated 20,000 yuan. Lu Yiyi, Lu Yiqing, and Lu Zhongliang jointly donated 20,000 yuan. Li Zhongyong donated 15,000 yuan. Shen Zhenglong, Ms. Yuan Chenruxiang, and Xu Pingyang each donated 10,000 yuan. Zi Zisheng donated 5,000 yuan. Mrs. Pu Qiting donated 1,000 yuan. The total received yesterday was 241,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Uphold the Spirit of Human Mutual Aid, Rescue Compatriots from Unforeseen Disaster</h3>
<p>Mr. Wu Peizhi wrote in a letter: "I am an apprentice in a store. Although I am young and have little strength, I am very concerned about social welfare. Therefore, I donate to any public welfare cause with all my efforts, believing that what I get from society should be repaid to the people, which is a joy in life. This time, Shanghai has suffered a tragic bombing, and compatriots have died unjustly and become displaced and homeless. It is unbearable to witness. Therefore, rescuing compatriots from unforeseen disasters is our bounden duty. Upholding the spirit of human mutual aid, we cannot sit idly by. My heart has been stirred. I have gathered 60,000 yuan from my savings and have done my best to raise funds from colleagues and friends, raising a total of 3.5 million yuan (the list is attached in a separate report), which will be used as a bombing relief fund. I believe that if we work together to rescue our compatriots, it will be easy to do. However, because my personal strength is limited, I cannot solicit donations from door to door. I hope that enthusiastic people in Shanghai will rise up in response, and that colleagues in major businesses will respond enthusiastically and do their best, so that the displaced can return to their homes, the dead can rest in peace, and those with broken arms and legs can be treated. This merit and virtue are immeasurable."</p>
<h3>Anonymous Donor Donates Free Hospital Beds</h3>
<p>Shanghai has been subjected to air raids for several consecutive days, and dozens of injured people have been sent to the Siming Hospital for treatment. The hospital is doing its best to treat them, but it is suffering from a lack of funds. Even gauze bandages for treating injuries are in short supply, relying on donations from all sectors of society. Yesterday, an anonymous donor generously donated ten free hospital beds for treating injuries, and all expenses will be covered by the donor. Their enthusiasm for public welfare is commendable. Anyone in need of these free beds can contact the hospital directly.</p>
<h3>Xiangsheng Tricycles Voluntarily Transport Injured Civilians</h3>
<p>Recently, this city was attacked by enemy aircraft, and many innocent civilians were killed and injured. Zhou Xiangsheng, Deputy Chief of the Joint Defense of the Lu Jiazui District, witnessed the injured civilians after the air raids. Because of the lack of vehicles at the rescue stations and hospitals, there were delays, resulting in loss of life. Therefore, he voluntarily provided the Xiangsheng tricycle passenger cars he operates for free transportation, without charging a penny. In the future, if the self-defense personnel of the Baojia in each district discover citizens injured by bombing or shrapnel during air raids, they can immediately call the tricycle company for free transportation. If there are dispatch vehicles of the company along the road, they can also provide transportation. The Baojia Office and the Police Department will commend Zhou, Deputy Chief of the Joint Defense, for his courage and willingness to act, and hope that tricycle companies in all districts will follow suit.</p>

<h3>Self-Reliance</h3>
<p>— Xia E</p>
<p>Picking up his younger brother's report card, he couldn't help but frown at the row of scores in the eighties and nineties.</p>
<p>"Brother, do you think my grades are good enough to get the Shuping Scholarship?" Joy shone on his brother's thin, small face.</p>
<p>His brother's question reminded him of the promise he made half a year ago: "As long as you study hard and get the Shuping Scholarship, I will definitely find a way to continue your schooling."</p>
<p>He didn't answer his brother. His eyes were a little blurred, and he seemed to feel that this report card was intertwined with his own experiences in high school.</p>
<p>He also had such good grades back then, and was also publicly praised as a good student at school. His father also promised that as long as his grades were excellent, he would definitely be able to go to university. But what was the result? After his father's departure and loss of support, he had no choice but to jump out and shoulder the burdens of life without graduating from high school.</p>
<p>"What's the use of studying so well!" he suddenly said angrily, throwing his brother's report card on the ground.</p>
<p>His brother's joyful face turned pale. He hurriedly picked up the report card that he had received from the principal in front of over a thousand classmates, as if feeling a kind of humiliated anger: "Why did you throw it on the ground? Are you angry that my grades are better than yours?"</p>
<p>Sitting next to him, his mother looked at him in surprise and coaxed his younger brother, "Don't argue with your brother. His grades weren't any worse than yours when he was studying."</p>
<p>After a while, she complained to him, "You shouldn't treat your brother like that. As an older brother, you should praise him for doing well in school."</p>
<p>A wave of awkward self-reproach swept through his heart. He knew that destroying a child's self-esteem and suppressing their ambition was a mistake. He knew that the words "studying is useless" had never been imprinted on his brother's pure heart, and that he must think that studying was the most important thing. He buries himself in his studies every day and doesn't play. Coupled with malnutrition, he looks much more haggard and weaker than other children. Why is that? Isn't it because a naive child's heart has been stained with the sorrows of life, understanding that if he doesn't study hard, he won't have the hope of going back to school and won't be able to satisfy his desire for knowledge?</p>
<p>-- My brother is innocent. I shouldn't transfer the pain I experienced to him. -- He said to himself deeply. He looked at his brother with loving eyes. His brother stood there in a daze, tears in his eyes.</p>
<p>"Mom, did you see what happened at another family's house? Someone got second place in the exam, and his dad was so happy that he bought him a lot of fish and meat to eat! But me... "his younger brother muttered with a pout. Realizing the injustice of the world, he was a little sad and angry.</p>
<p>At this moment, his father, who was sleeping in bed, turned over and groaned softly, as if he had heard their conversation.</p>
<p>He looked at his father's sallow face and said to his brother with a frown, "You need to understand that it's not just the tuition fee that's the problem now, it's the problem of eating! Even if you don't have to pay tuition to go to school, you still have to eat at home, and that won't work! Now is the time for you to find food for yourself!" He spoke each word tightly, and each sound hit his heart harder than it hit his brother's.</p>
<p>"Ask me to find food for myself?" A shadow fell over his brother's eyes. "Where can I go to find food? Even people as old as Dad can't do it, so how can it be my turn?"</p>
<p>"Yes, your dad... your dad has suffered from reading too many books!... "His father's voice was almost a powerless scream: "Reading made me an upright person. I have no property, but I won't cheat people out of their money, I won't make a fortune off the country's misfortune, and I won't flatter and toady... I only know how to use my strength and blood to earn money, to earn pitiful money!... Those black-hearted employers hired me at a very low price, squeezed out all my blood, and then abandoned me!... Child, I have been abandoned. Under such high life pressure, I can no longer afford to let you study or even eat!... Child, my blood is dry, but in order to survive, I still have to ask you to send your young bodies to another group of black-hearted employers to squeeze your blood!"</p>
<p>His father took a long breath. His weak heart was beating very fast from talking so much.</p>
<p>"What's wrong with you? Just rest and get some sleep. Why are you thinking so much?" His mother patted his father's back, her voice bewildered, "The children are grown up, and we won't suffer too much. Good days are coming."</p>
<p>The older brother put his hand on his younger brother's shoulder and said in a low voice, "Brother, listen to me. I went to see Uncle Huang yesterday, and he said that a friend of his owns a copper and tin shop and is looking for an apprentice. I immediately recommended you to him. He told me to call back in two days for an answer. We should be able to get it."</p>
<p>"You want me to be an apprentice?" His brother raised his head in panic, then lowered it again in despair. "I remember that you used to scold the bosses of those old-fashioned shops for oppressing their apprentices, making them suffer beatings and scoldings for five years. If they did something wrong, they would be told to get lost. You said that those bosses were demons who turned children into slaves and would be overthrown one day... But now you want me to go! I'm scared..."</p>
<p>"I said those things, and I have never forgotten them! But, brother, those were just powerless words! In fact, not only the bosses of old-fashioned shops, but also the bosses in the so-called modern companies where I work, also use very cruel means to make us their slaves who dare not resist! Brother, think about it, aren't those words all the same?"</p>
<p>His mother listened to her son's words, and a glimmer of hope flowed through her cold heart that had been deprived of warmth for so long, as if a position had been secured. She no longer thought about the boss's fierce eyes and crooked face. She only hallucinated that her clever little son had entered the door of business and prosperity. Before he was poisoned by the empty talk in books, he had grasped the method of making money and seeking profit, and would soon become a capable businessman, like many people nowadays, cleverly taking a lot of wealth by crooked means.</p>
<p>-- Yes, a money-grubber is not a good name, but at least it's better than the two words "pure and aloof," which are enough to make people starve to death! -- She had no choice but to think like this.</p>
<p>The brother listened quietly, thought quietly, and suddenly picked up the report card and tore it to shreds.</p>
<p>"Hey, what's that?" His mother picked up the shredded report card with regret. "Even though you're going to be an apprentice now, it's only temporary. You can still go to school later, right? This report card is proof that you can go to school later. Why did you tear it up?"</p>
<p>"Mom, I don't want to study anymore. Poor people can't turn their lives around even if they study..."</p>
<p>The older brother stood there in a daze. He wanted to tell his younger brother that poor people should also study, but what they study is not just textbooks, but also a living life and a living book. Only by reading a living book can you know how to live and transform - for yourself and for the masses! But he didn't tell his brother this. He knew that in the future, his brother would understand more clearly than him, and perhaps his belief in transformation would be even stronger!</p>
<p>"Brother, you can be self-reliant. You are more useful than your classmates!" It took him a long time to utter these words.</p>
<p>"I can be self-reliant. I know." His brother flashed a firm gaze. "The teacher said that suffering can forge useful people. Brother, isn't that right? What does suffering matter to us?"</p>
<h3>Birthday</h3>
<p>— Lu Wen</p>
<p>I went to a relative's house to celebrate a birthday.</p>
<p>As soon as I entered the door, I smelled something strange in the air. Not to mention anything else, it didn't look like someone was having a birthday at all. There were no candles, longevity incense, or anything like that. Apart from me, there were no other guests.</p>
<p>"Congratulations, congratulations." I said to the host, cupping my hands and bowing.</p>
<p>"Please sit down," the host said indifferently.</p>
<p>The birthday celebrant was just like he usually was, and hadn't changed in the slightest because it was his birthday. He was angry, talking to his two daughters.</p>
<p>"Tuition!... All day long, it's just these fees, tuition fees, gymnastics fees..."</p>
<p>"Physical education fee," the younger daughter corrected him quietly.</p>
<p>"I know..." the birthday celebrant shouted loudly, turning his face to me and saying, "These schools nowadays, what are they? They haven't taught much, but they're asking for money all day long, one fee after another, one donation after another..."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes." I said, accompanying him.</p>
<p>I knew this elder's temperament. He would say whatever he thought, without worrying about offending others. Just like this time, he clearly knew that I was also a teacher and should also be in the category of "what are they." But I knew that he didn't mean to accuse all the monks of being bald.</p>
<p>"Now," he continued to testify, "now there's another retention fee, saying that if you don't pay it by the deadline, you'll be fined a thousand yuan for every day that it's late... Is this a school?!"</p>
<p>"Learning to paint is really expensive nowadays," I said, answering a question with another question, intending to ease the atmosphere.</p>
<p>"That's right, they say it's four dou of rice. According to today's market price, it's almost 400,000 yuan. Two of them would be 800,000 yuan. It's no joke!"</p>
<p>"Actually, the number is scary, but it's just eight dou of rice," his wife, a distant aunt of mine, said, seemingly seasoned in worldly affairs.</p>
<p>"But, hey! Her eyes aren't small." The gentleman's fire turned to his wife: "But I earned them one by one, not grabbed them in handfuls. You don't care about anything at home, just enjoy what's already there..."</p>
<p>"What do you mean, just enjoy what's already there! Who's busy with the firewood and rice?" The wife seemed to be getting angry too.</p>
<p>"Tuition fees are outrageous!" I said, trying to ease the atmosphere.</p>
<p>"That's why!" Finally, the gentleman's anger calmed down: "In this day and age, I really don't know what the use of studying is. To be honest with you, if I weren't in this position, if I weren't working at a bank, I would really want to send these two children to work in a factory..."</p>
<p>I smiled at him. "You're joking!"</p>
<p>The host continued very seriously:</p>
<p>"It's true. I'm not joking. Nowadays, you can get three or four dou of rice for working in some places. Three or four dou of rice is now 300,000 to 400,000 yuan! I only get 160,000 to 170,000 yuan now. And I have to support such a big family. That's why I said, I really want to do that!"</p>
<p>He faced his wife: "Speaking of which, someone's daughter is working in a factory." His wife didn't know if she disagreed at all, or if she was just joking for her husband's birthday, to add a little joy to the atmosphere. Otherwise, she just unintentionally said this.</p>
<p>But the birthday celebrant got angry.</p>
<p>"Face? In this day and age, who cares about face? Not starving to death is a good thing!"</p>
<p>Saying this, he threw a folding fan he was shaking heavily on the table. "Clang!"</p>
<p>"Can't you say something auspicious for your birthday?" his wife said in a low voice. "And there are guests here."</p>
<p>"You're being too polite," I said with a dry laugh. "What kind of guest am I?"</p>
<p>"What does it matter if there are guests?" the birthday celebrant still had that attitude. "We're family. Why be so polite? To be honest, old nephew, you know my temper. I really don't like pretending to be rich, but your aunt really likes that. She's always talking about face. It makes us look strong on the outside but weak on the inside."</p>
<p>"This is human interaction. It's not about showing off or not," his wife protested.</p>
<p>I felt a heat on my face, and sweat broke out. I was at a loss, not knowing how to break the deadlock. I really didn't expect to encounter such a birthday scene when I came to celebrate.</p>
<p>At this moment, my uncle didn't get angry or complain. He just sighed.</p>
<p>"Human interaction. If I had gotten used to it earlier, I wouldn't still be in this position today. In the past ten years, how many people have soared to success..."</p>
<p>"Don't say such depressing things, okay? Weishan is young. Why are you saying these things to him?" The hostess interrupted him. "Let's eat."</p>
<p>"Alright. But there's nothing depressing about it. It's the truth." He finally stopped talking. "Is there any wine? Weishan, have a drink with me. I haven't had a drink in a long time."</p>
<p>While eating, the birthday celebrant kept nagging. Actually, it was wrong to say nagging. Who could hate the groans of a person squeezed by the heavy burdens of life?</p>
<p>My aunt had prepared a few dishes. Maybe it was because I was there, so she couldn't explode. I only saw my uncle frown when he glanced at the table and found a few meat dishes.</p>
<p>I didn't know what to say. My uncle kept flipping a bowl of vegetarian dishes with his chopsticks, as if looking for something, and occasionally impatiently chased away the flies that landed on the table. The two cousins were probably depressed about the retention fee, and only focused on eating with their heads down.</p>
<p>The lights weren't on yet, and the house was dark.</p>
<p>My aunt wanted to break the awkward atmosphere, and tried her best to smile naturally:</p>
<p>"I'm really being neglectful. It's rare for Weishan to come to our house for dinner, and he even came to celebrate your birthday. We didn't even prepare any good dishes."</p>
<p>"Don't say that, Aunt," I said, hearing my own forced laughter. "I should have come to celebrate your birthday."</p>
<p>"Actually, what's the point of a birthday?" my uncle said. "There's no need to rush around so much. As for some people who throw big banquets for their birthdays, that's even more unnecessary."</p>
<p>My uncle didn't smile once from beginning to end. To be honest, who would want to laugh? In this day and age, are there really so many funny things?</p>
<p>"Drink less wine," my aunt looked at my uncle and pointed at the dishes on the table. I knew she meant that if he drank any more, there wouldn't be any dishes left to eat later.</p>
<p>"I might as well not drink," my uncle put down his cup and said to me. "I originally wanted to use wine to relieve my worries, but I didn't expect that the more I drank, the more worried I became, ha."</p>
<p>He gave a bitter laugh. That was the first smile I saw on his birthday.</p>
<p>The lights weren't on yet.</p>
<h3>Don't Linger Any Longer</h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>Shanghai is no longer a paradise for adventurers!</p>
<p>The terror of night and day is shaking your brain - life has no guarantee!</p>
<p>But perhaps you are briefly awake. After the roar, you are again dreaming of picking up gold! Stocks, real estate, hoarding, Western-style houses, cars, rickshaws, singing, dancing... How comfortable! How can you bear to give it up?</p>
<p>But, flesh and blood flying! The scene of a sandstorm catastrophe, doesn't it move you? Doesn't it frighten you?</p>
<p>Friends! Don't linger any longer! Shoulder your courage, and stride back to your hometown!</p>
<p>Shanghai is no longer a haven for adventurers!</p>
<h3>Goodbye, Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Guang Bo</p>
<p>Tomorrow morning, we will be leaving Shanghai, where we have lived for over a decade and established some roots. The sole reason and purpose for our entire family's departure from Shanghai is, of course, to "evacuate." In fact, aside from a very small number of people who must stay in the city, every citizen needs to evacuate. However, most people have not yet made this decision. Are they unwilling to evacuate? In fact, everyone knows that their bodies are made of flesh and cannot withstand shrapnel; moreover, even if they sacrifice themselves, they won't get a title like "martyr" or anything. They are all a group of people who believe that "life is what I desire, but wealth is also what I desire."</p>
<p>For example, my older brother keeps yelling, "Evacuate, evacuate! What will happen to my business?" I said, "Business, business, a stone tower in the desert. I think no one dares to guarantee that all their wealth during this period can be safely transferred to the next period (the new era). You insist on building a business during the war, while I want to protect and develop my future."</p>
<p>My sister-in-law is just like the average young mistress nowadays, without ever having suffered, and without a correct new mindset. She said, "All my things (of course, referring to clothes...) can't be moved, and there are so many bad people in the countryside!" I said, "Being taken by bad people is more humane than being bombed." She said:</p>
<p>"How do you know for sure that we will be bombed?" I said, "Like winning the lottery with odds of tens of thousands, didn't you, sister-in-law, have great hopes of winning? But now there are dozens of bombs coming down. How do you know that none of them will hit us?" My second brother immediately said, "Isn't it too early to leave Shanghai right now?" I said, "Judging by the compatriots who sacrificed on the 17th, 18th, and 24th of this month, it's already too late. If we are bombed tonight and leave Shanghai tomorrow morning, it will still be too late."</p>
<p>My third brother, who recently got a girlfriend, is even more reluctant to leave Shanghai. He said, "If I die, I die. People are going to die once anyway." I said, "Like you and me, I haven't done anything for society or the country, so sacrificing ourselves like this would be letting down society and humanity!"</p>
<p>After a round of persuasion from me, our family finally unified our will. What I saw this time, although not universally applicable, can be summarized as follows: 1. People are weak and only want to maintain the status quo, and 2. The family bond is already like a pile of loose sand. At the same time, what I experienced regarding evacuation is that if one person in a family is enlightened and does something, he should strongly advocate it and will definitely be able to motivate the entire family to act. Because everyone wants their life, and is afraid of bombs.</p>
<p>Therefore, I hope that the enlightened people can firmly advocate it. If ten people are determined, perhaps ten families will evacuate. And I hope that starting tomorrow, you will also leave this Shanghai, where there is a possibility of being bombed, one family at a time.</p>
<p>Goodbye, Shanghai!</p>
