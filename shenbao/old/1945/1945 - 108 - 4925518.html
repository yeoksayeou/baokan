<h3>沖繩本島周圍海面　日軍獲重大戰果　三日中沉毀敵艦卅一艘</h3>
<p>日大本營發表</p>
<p>東京十七日中央社電　日大本營十七日下午四時發表：（1）日航空部隊與冲繩本島守術部隊之勇戰互相呼應，繼續攻擊本島四周敵艦船及機動部隊，自四月十四日至十六日止，在此期間內反覆猛攻該敵部隊，予以重大損害，並急襲本島北中兩飛機塲，三十二處受炸發生火災，使敵陷於大混亂。此役日方所獲戰果業糾查明者如次：擊沉戰艦二艘·戰艦或巡洋艦一艘·大型艦（大致爲空母）一艘·巡洋艦二艘·驅逐艦二艘·艦型不詳者八艘（內一艘大致爲空母），擊毀大型艦（大致爲空母）一艘·運輸船三艘·艦型不詳者入艘。參加此次攻擊之航空部隊，大半爲特別攻擊隊。（2）日水上特別攻擊隊，四月十五日深夜攻擊嘉手納海面敵艦，擊沉艦型不詳者二艘，另擊毀一艘。</p>
<p>東京十七日中央社電日航空部隊及水上特攻隊，繼續猛攻冲繩島附近敵艦，十四·十五·十六三日內，已擊沉十八艘，擊傷十三艘。自冲繩島戰事發生以來，擊沉及擊傷之敵艦船總計已達三百七十八艘。</p>
<h3>敵機動隊復圖蠢動</h3>
<p>南西太平洋日軍基地十七日中央社電　冲繩本島周邊之敵艦隊，爲援救陸上敵軍之苦戰，强行躍起，施行掩護作戰。據十六日偵察結果，在喜界島東南海面發現敵艦，有正規空母二艘，戰艦二艘，其稍南方有正規空母一艘，特攻空母一艘，更在此南方同樣又有以特設空母。正規空母各一艘爲基幹之敵機動部隊三隊，此外更有一隊於八重山島一帶游弋。此外，於慶良閒列島附近。更發現特設空母二艘·空母合計十二艘乃至十四艘之數，虎視眈耽窺候戰機。冲繩本烏周邊游弋於中域海面，更有巡洋艦一艘，驅逐艦四艘，運輸船約百艘，其中運輸船數艘在起火燃燒，由陸上可能望見。北部飛機場附近海面，敵以巡洋艦十三乃至十四艘·驅逐艦二十五艘。掃海艇若干艘爲主力之集團艦隊，毫不間斷向日軍陸上防地猛烈射擊。</p>
<h3>日特攻隊三次總攻</h3>
<p>東京十七日中央社電　據某海軍基地特派員報告：日航空部隊自十六日起，對於冲繩島附近敵艦隊及奄美大島方面之敵機動部隊，開始第三次總攻擊，即日陸軍轟炸隊對於北中兩機場之敵小型及中型轟炸機，加以轟炸及掃射，至次晨，日制空部隊及神風特攻隊由基地大舉出發，其中一隊衝入慶良間列島附近之敵艦隊中，擊沉大型艦一艘及其他軍艦數艘，又另一特攻隊猛攻奄美大島東南方海面以空母二·戰艦三·及其他軍艦十數艘之兩羣機動部隊，敵方爲牽制日方特攻隊之總攻繫，曾於上午十時及下午一時空襲九州各地機塲，來襲敵機不過數十架，其中有數架中型北美洲式B25型轟炸機，日各特攻隊下午繼續出發，飛臨奄美大島東南方攻擊敵空母二艘·大型艦三艘·及其他軍艦數艘。</p>
<p>琉球羣島基地十七日中央社電　日陸海軍特攻隊刻對集於冲繩島四周之敵機動部隊，連日繼續果敢之拼撞攻擊，十六日夜聞之攻擊，截止現在爲止所判明之戰果，計轟沉巡艦一艘，艦型不詳者一艘，擊沉巡洋艦一艘，戰艦或巡洋艦一艘。</p>
<h3>日皇撫恤災黎　賜優渥敕語</h3>
<p>束京十七日中央社電　日天皇爲軫念蒙受戰災者，賜予優渥敕語，頃由宮內省發表如次：</p>
<p>戰局愈益危念，敵對我國土侵襲日趨苛烈，朕皇國赤子有殪於非命，苦於傷痍，或破產失業，觀其聊生於世，朕不勝軫念之至，茲輸內帑錢幣，以充撫恤審查之資，汝各有司，宜深體朕意而普衆庶，以期所託。</p>
<p>東京十七日中央社電　日皇爲軫念敵機空襲下之民衆，前曾派員實地視察情况，並於三月十八日躬親巡幸東京受災地區，惟邇來敵機來襲更形頻仍，受災者增多，日皇特於十七日對受災人民下賜優渥敕語，並賜帑金一千萬圓充救濟之用。鈴木首相於上午九時晉宮拜受敕語後退出，繼之首相向松平宮相拜領賜金。</p>
<h3>爭奪制空權　入決戰階段　沖繩島日軍反攻熾烈</h3>
<p>東京十七日中央社電　日航空隊攻擊冲繩海域機動部隊及艦船，十五日後更趨熾烈，日特攻隊以新銳戰鬥機隊爲先導，不分晝夜猛烈攻擊，致戰爭海域一帶幾全爲大爆炸大火柱所籠罩，敵艦載機之抵抗漸見衰弱，雖經日軍連續痛繫，然不能坐視陸上部隊之存亡，是以敵乃執拗繼續强行增援接濟，採取必死戰術，並企圖切斷日軍航空勢力之後援路綫，以艦載機圖炸九州，以B29型機欲策應强化轟炸日本土戰略。來襲九州之敵機數，十六日激減至僅五十餘架，同時駐冲繩本島北中部飛機場之敵中小型機，亦為日空陸兩軍制壓，已限於不能活動狀態，於是制空權爭奪戰已進入決戰階段。沖島作戰敵襤載機直接協力掩護之激減，及敵基地航空兵力活動之呆滯，已極明顯，是皆日軍特攻隊奮勇殺敵，而使敵陸上部隊陷於無後援狀態，並入重大決戰階段。</p>
<p>東京十七日中央社電　冲繩島上日軍反攻戰愈形猛烈，南部地區敵軍準備攻擊首里前方日軍陣地，日軍連日實行襲擊，十六日晨敵方因前綫損失重大，調後方部隊接替陣地，日軍自十二日至十五日殺敵人數共一千七百人，已由大本營發表，然嗣後查悉更有四十人被日軍殺死，十五日晨敵於砲乒援護下來攻日軍陣地，日軍與之交戰六小時後將之擊退，一方敵於十五日上午十一時許，在水納島登陸，敵方更有在伊江烏登陸之企圖。</p>
<h3>敵機襲九州　邀擊戰果調查中</h3>
<p>東京十七日中央社電　敵B29型機八十架左右，十七日下午二時來襲九州，轟炸各地飛機場，經一小時半遁去，日當局現正調查邀盤戰果中。今次敵機來襲目的，似在於攻擊日方航空戰力根據地，其戰術頗堪注目。</p>
<h3>敵機轟炸神宮係有計劃行動</h3>
<p>東京十七日中央社電　敵機前次轟炸日木伊勢神域，十四日拂曉復對明治神宮施以轟炸，由此可見敵方攻擊，係有計劃之行動。當十四日空襲時，代代木及原宿附近並無一彈投擲，僅對準神宮投下燒夷彈約一千三百發，四周樹木叢圍之廣大神域，敵機轟炸目標僅為本殿拜殿等極小區域，在本殿及拜殿火爍場中已發掘燒夷彈約七百五十個，該時保護神域之人員莫不努力搶救，惟以一部份救火設備受炸，致無法使用，未幾火勢即波及本殿及拜殿。觀察敵方用意，似在破壞日本國民之中心信仰，惟日本國民咸抱復讐之心，努力收拾火場，至十六日大致已告完成。在神宮開始趕築大殿，暫時在寶物殿　安置神位，一兩日內一般國民當又可趨前參拜。</p>
<p>東京十七日中央社電　一月十四日敵機施行盲炸，發犯伊勢豐受大神宮，日政府決定迅速進行復興工作，十七日開閣議，由第二預備金支出四十七萬二千元，修理神樂殿齊殿及其他被害建築物。</p>
<h3>日國民組特攻隊期完成衛國使命　定廿五日舉行結盟式</h3>
<p>東京十七日中央社電　日本全國人民爲迎擊侵寇本土之敵人，決定組織全日本國民特攻隊，定二十五日下午一時在束京都中野區日本閣舉行成立式與結盟式，此項組織係響應國民義勇隊之組織方針，不取任何形式，自動奮起衛國，將來成爲國民義勇隊之中心，完成所負社評</p>
<h3>老河口之役與大陸戰局</h3>
<p>最近束亞戰局有兩點特別值得注意：第一是敵美對冲繩島的攻勢，於遭受重大損失之後，已見稍殺。故不得不改以恐怖空襲戰略，妄圖擾亂後方。第二是中國大陸方面，盟邦駐軍依然保持主動優勢，其前途頗可注目·茲就中國大陸戰塲的新局面，稍加申說如次：</p>
<p>所謂大陸總反攻或六月總攻，大體上分爲三區，第一是以緬甸戰塲爲總根據地的西南反攻綫，包括緬甸·雲南·貴州·廣西·湖南·甚至越南和泰國。第二以中原即第五戰區為中心的華中反攻綫，企圖越平漢粵漢而東，北迄黃河，南至長江南岸流域。第三反攻綫爲柬南沿海各地的攻勢，積極增加兵力，具有一面截擊日軍一面配合反軸心軍登陸戰的雙重企圖。此外，共軍方面，也有在華北和華中沿海一帶發動以圖配合所謂總反攻而乘機擴張勢力的野心。</p>
<p>除了中共佈置中的所謂反攻計劃，當另行論述之外，上述美渝合作策動中的反攻戰略，三條反攻戰綫中，無疑的以華中一綫最被重視，最近且巳調渝中央嫡系的劉峙替代第五戰區司令長官李宗仁；且謀加緊完成史蒂威爾公路，以積極增强美國軍需對第五戰區的直接接濟。這個反攻戰略重心所在的第五戰區，又以老河口爲中心，正在積極推進各種軍略部署。但是，日軍對此種企圖，已於事前發覺，所以在上月巳先展開反擊，佔領其東北的南陽，數日前更佔領老河口，打擊了華中反攻的心臟。從此日軍可以老河口爲中心，左自宜昌，右至洛陽，奮張兩翼而向西進，以斷川陝兩省的交通，北可以威脅延安，南可以迂迥重慶後方。顯然巳把敵方總反攻的計劃在事先予以粉碎了。</p>
<p>至於所謂西南反攻綫，爲總反攻的總根據地，近方動員十萬知識靑年，在雲南等地受敵美之訓練，並有不少己參加印度緬甸的遠征軍。而敵美裝備改編的渝軍，亦集中於西南地區·在作戰指揮部方面，最近也有新的改編。其前途極可注目。但是緬甸·越南·泰國各方面的日軍，正在嚴密對敵監視之中，而湘桂日軍，亦未一刻放鬆制敵的時機·最近且已展開對湘省西南芷江的新攻勢，敵方西南反攻綫的正面快要遭受突破的命運。</p>
<p>東南沿海一帶，渝美軍近來頗有積極增强的趨勢，而該方面敵美飛機最爲活動，最近對港粵以上粵漢沿綫城市及沿海港灣城市的襲擊亦趨頻繁，但是從上海一直到香港，沿海各主要港市都在日軍保衛之下，近一二月來的防衛力更趨强化，而浙贛路一帶的進一步推動，叉是隨時可以實現的，所以敵方的企圖並不足慮。</p>
<p>總之，目前大陸戰局，以盟邦駐軍攻占老河口爲轉捩，即將有更可重視的發展，只要大陸戰塲大局安定，使敵美慾無可逞，那麽，敵人在海洋上的躍動，只有遭受慘重損失，以至最後崩潰而已。在敵方愈是燥急圖逞之時，我們必須鎮靜安定，沉着應付。</p>
<h3>最近國際政治之觀察</h3>
<p>— 南公</p>
<p>最近在國際上發生了兩件大事，一爲蘇聯通告日本不延長中立條約，一爲美總統羅斯福之逝世。茲欲討論日蘇中立關係之前途，應先觀察反軸心國關係之發展。蘇聯與英美之閱的合作本爲表面的，在具體問題上矛盾甚多，並無聯合到底之可能，加以羅斯福逝世後，反軸心國問缺一融和各國意見之有力人物。因英美蘇不能密切合作，故日蘇關係決不致起意外變化，而當可繼續維持中立。茲先論反軸心國間之關係如何：</p>
<p>（一）反軸心國間的關係</p>
<p>美英蘇關係因羅斯福之死，頗受影響。蓋羅斯福，邱吉爾，史太林三人，在表面上意見一致，實則邱史兩人意見相左，蘇聯百科全書並經註明，邱吉爾乃英國人中反蘇最力者。而能使邱吉爾，史太林意見漸趨一致者，唯羅斯福而已。今羅斯福逝世，美大總統雖已由特魯曼繼任，然在美國究巳失去中心人物，三國關係之維緊，亦因羅斯福之死，受到相當影響。</p>
<p>蘇聯通吿日本，不延長中立條約，是克里米亞會議中決定之一，亦即會議中美英之要求，其交換絛件爲美英承認蘇聯在東亞之某重要地域之自由權，上述條件，美國合衆社，紐約太晤士報及英國報章均經露布，並謂此乃美英對蘇之大讓步。此對重慶關係重大，而事前竟不獲通知，當然不滿。因重慶並未參加克里米亞會議，故對三國之自由解決此一問題，除不滿之外，未發一言，由此一端亦可見聯合國意見之不統一。英對該地域，本無多大利害關係，美對該地域乃存有野望者，此次對蘇聯之讓步，寶因自國人力，物資等困難有以致之。</p>
<p>舊金山會議波蘭出席問題，在克里米亞會議時，美英蘇三國本已商得同意，由波改設臨時政府，三國予以承認後，乃可遣派代表參加。事後，蘇聯忽推翻決議，要求由盧布林政府派員參加，美英方面認爲，此事己經克里米亞會議決定，未便更改，遂拒絕蘇方要求，此一問題，迄今尚未解決。由此以觀，可知克里米亞會議在表面上似甚圓滿，但對具體問題之協商，尚未臻妥善，美國報紙因此大肆攻擊政府之草率從事。關於組織新的國際聯盟問題，在投票方面，三國意見亦未一致。在克里米亞會議時，曾決定在聯盟理事會中，美英蘇三國有絕對全權，在全體會中美蘇各得三票，美輿論對此亦大加攻擊，欲予推翻，蓋英國包括加拿大，紐西蘭，澳洲，印度，南非聯邦共爲六票，爲對抗英國，故美蘇要求三票，由此足見彼此利害關係衝突之一斑。</p>
<p>美英國內之動向，亦一重要問題，在美國方面，最要者爲政府與議會之對立。關於太平洋島嶼處理問題，美議會及軍部均主張永久佔據，但羅斯福在克里米亞會議時，決定由國際共管，此種對立情勢，如羅斯福不死，尚可圓滑應付，今由特魯曼繼任總統，其政洽手腕遠不及羅斯福，預料美政府與議會閒之關係，將愈趨複雜。美國國內意見既屬紛歧，則其對外所訂條約自將受到影響，而難以生效。在舊金山會議中美派代表九人，除國務卿外，民主黨，共和黨各四人，此即美政府希望由兩黨共肩其責任之意。</p>
<p>英國在舊金山會議之前，已在倫敦預先開會，紐西蘭，澳洲反對聯盟理事會權力過大，由此可見英國國內意見之不一致。印度問題亦爲一重要事件，蓋大西洋憲章對印不適用之故，印督華維爾返倫敦商討此問題時，認爲印度問題如不獲圓滿解決，將有發生第三次大戰之可能，由此又足見英國內部問題之嚴重。戰爭開始後，英圖由保守黨，勞動黨組織聯合政府，現則勞動黨忽又開始攻擊政府，此即兩黨行將分裂之兆。美英兩國此種國內情形發展之結果，將使兩國互相協助之機會大爲減少。美英蘇三國之合作，亦不過見諸表面，實際上關於具體問題意見並不一致。</p>
<p>（二）日蘇關係的前途</p>
<p>日蘇關係，就雙方立塲觀之，即可明瞭。（1）蘇聯立塲，在對德作戰方面，與美英意見果屬一致，但對東方問題，則意見並不一致。又蘇聯今後之動向，由其國內情勢，亦可加以觀測。蘇聯在此次四年戰爭中，地方破報過甚。其困苦自不待言，今後急待解決者，乃戰後復興問題。蘇聯與英國已簽訂二十年互助條約，可見其戰後復興工作十分重要，蘇方且已向美要求借款數百萬萬美金，目前蘇聯的要求，就是「需要休息」。</p>
<p>（2）日本立塲，蘇聯雖已通知中立條約不再延長，惟日木仍求誠意維持中立關係，蓋條約須至明年四月始告失效故也。此次日本內閣更迭，東鄉出任外相，美英對此均甚注意，東鄉在日本政治界，外交界，爲有智慧有見解者，蘇聯方面對東鄉氏亦頗有認識，由蘇聯方面之立塲及日方聲明誠意而觀，日蘇將來之關係，當可預料也。</p>
<p>（三）結論</p>
<p>總括言之，日本對戰局重大性之估計，並非過小，但日本之解放大東亞戰爭目標必貫澈到底，而日本民衆亦已燃起決戰到底之火，戰爭愈激烈，目標愈分明，必努力以赴之也。</p>

<p>里斯本十六日中央社電　華盛頓電：英外長艾登·蘇外委長莫洛托夫·法外長畢多爾特·渝外長宋子文等，預定於本週六在華盛頓召集外長會談，屆時美國務卿亦將出席參加，商討舊金山會議有關問題。</p>
<h3>德元首呼籲軍民　出全力抗敵　蘇軍距柏林四十五公里</h3>
<p>柏林十七日中央社電　海通社訊：德元首希特勒昨向東綫官兵，發表遏阻赤軍屠殺之呼籲。略謂，柏林仍在德人手中，維也納仍將屬於德人，歐洲永不致隸屬於俄人，目前之大戰誠爲世界浩劫之天數，但戰局必有轉變之可能。元首詞語，充滿堅强熱情。元首繼以尖銳之語調稱，凡不履行任務之士兵，在此情形下，皆爲德國人民之奸賊，一團或一師不能確守陣地而放棄者，有何面目再見遭遇恐怖轟炸之婦孺，今凡擅自下令退却者，將不問其官級如何，就地逮捕，倘遇必要則將予於就地鎗決。</p>
<p>柏林十七日中央社電　海通社訊：北起庫斯特林，南遠尼芝與沃特河合流之點，蘇軍于昨晨三時半開始大規模攻勢，德軍以密集炮火，阻敵前進，現正在激戰中。昨晨蘇軍在福斯特區開始大戰。</p>
<p>柏林十七日中央社電　據前綫消息：蘇軍已抵沃特河西方約二十公里之塞拉島區，傳十六日夜抵達庫斯特林至柏林間之公路，此處距首都約四十五公里。</p>
<p>旅行通訊</p>
<h3>郝鵬舉省長談淮海政治革新</h3>
<p>— 逸飛</p>
<p>淮海記行之二</p>
<p>四月五日午後，記者往淮海省政府訪問省長郝鵬舉氏，當被導入『外實室」時，首先引起注意的是高懸壁際的郝氏手書的「淮海省軍政人員革新生活誓約」，與「淮海省行政人員信條」兩個鏡框。誓約內開頭有着這麽令人感動的辭句：「今日足以斷送吾人之竇貴人格及光榮事業者，厥爲自私·虛偽·萎廢·渙散·浮薄·粗疏之風，與無秩序·無紀律·消磨光陰·浪費公物·不遵守時間之弊。」這正是郝省長建設新淮海的範本。</p>
<p>郝氏在記者想像裏，總以爲是個某種典型的軍人，專斷，輕燥；但當踏進郝氏辦公室時，呈現在我眼前的　，却意外地是一位和藹可親深有涵養的長官。</p>
<p>記者首先請對新淮海之建設·及目前勵行之「靑年政治」運動發表意見，郝氏答稱：「當此世界每個角落，都被戰雲籠罩的時代，祗有破壞，建設可說無從談起；但淮海省年來雖處惡劣環境中，仍能埋頭苦幹，努力各部門之建設，祗就目下徐州市內建築物與夫公路之開闢河流之疏導言，平均較前已增加百分之三十至四十。須知淮海省的建築材料至爲缺乏，在此種困難情形下，能有此些微成就，實非易易，差可自慰。</p>
<p>「過去淮海省府的政治力，完全可以達到下層的組織細胞，毫無一絲的隔膜。依年來成績論，下級政治階層中之工作人員，曾受政治訓練者，已佔全體三分之二以上。爲使彼第安心任職起見，已打破我國官場向來「一朝天子一朝臣」的惡習，所以有時縣長雖經調動，但其僚屬却不更動一人。又各縣縣政府早已分別成立金庫，會計完全獨立，實行統收統支的辦法。縣府經濟鞏固，行政運用自能圓滑。這是過去淮海省的一貫施政方針。最近爲更求澈底建設大淮海起見，決定實行「靑年政治」；所謂靑年政治者，即以靑年人朝氣逢勃之熟忱精神，作為推行政治的原動力，用大刀闊斧快刀亂麻的手段，對淮海省內障碍新淮海建設的封建殘餘，予以肅淸。如剷除土劣與貪污，糾正民間陋俗，實行强迫教育，提高民智水準，培養各項人才等。目前此種政治改革運動，正在籌劃推行，實施之期，已不在遠，擬先將一批中學畢業生，施來政治訓練後，派往各縣作佐治人員。此舉目標有二，即（1）以靑年的熱力以訓練民衆，務使能做一良好的公民，以與政府之理想配合；（2）以靑年人爲基本幹部，來領導進行一切困難工作。所以「靑年政治」就是用革命精神推動政治，換言之也就是淮海省的精神總動員，務期做到盡美盡善的理想境地」。（未完）</p>

<h3>對不法牟利商人　決予檢舉法辦　經濟警察當局力謀抑平物價</h3>
<p>本市日來百物飛漲，尤其食米黑市竟超十五大關，民生感受嚴重威脅，一般不法商人，祇圖牟取暴利，乘機擅抬物價，而絕不顧及民生，各界咸極憤憑。木市經濟警察當局爲談澈底取締此種不法行爲，特於十七日晨十一時召開臨時緊急會議，經縝密之商討，巳籌有相當辦法，抱最大之決心，對若輩不法商人，決予檢舉法辦。飲出動全體經濟警察，至全市各市場商店行號嚴密關查，對十一種主要物品，均須遵照物品評價委員會評定之限價出售，即其他物品亦須按照各該榮公會之協定價格出售，如有起越情事，當予最嚴厲之懲辦，並　市民協力檢舉，以戰漲風而安民生云。</p>
<h3>周財長派員　徹查證交情形　並嚴禁經濟人場外交易</h3>
<p>近日本市各種證券漲風劇烈，非特擾亂金融，抑且影響市面危害民生，聞財政部周部長令派檢查金融事務處李激，張谷如，張仲寰，會同上海市經濟局局長許江，及交易所監理官辦事處，徹查交易所證劵交易情形，呈候核辦，以安市面。</p>
<p>又周部長曾手令證券交易所，自十七日起停止便交，茲復於十七日手令該交易所：　嚴禁證券交易所經紀人作場外交易，一經查出，重則吊鎮執照，輕則停止營榮。　嚴禁經紀人以外之人入證券交易所交易，着該交易所門禁務必嚴格。</p>
<p>午後交易提前交割</p>
<p>昨據證交所方面消息，該所對於午後交易，所有各經紀人與客戶之交割，多延至次日下午辦理，現值股市動　之際，爲取締買塵賣空之暴利份子投機活躍，自十七起規定午後交易，一律提前於隔日上午交割，如不能遵守交割，當即停止其買賣。</p>
<p>又悉：證交當局因奉周市長手令停止便交，十七日所有經紀人證券號均遵令辦理，至客戶預繳保證將於十八日分別發還。</p>
<h3>本市北部　受炸區情形</h3>
<p>本月十五日晨四時左右，敵機一架襲滬，在北部某區，作漫無區別之投彈。中央社記者會前往視察，見被燬民房商店，其屋頂及地板多有被洞穿者，至於破碎招脾，曲折之樑橡，以及瓦礫等，亦在在皆是。有一彈在路中爆發，雖距離甚遠之樓窗玻璃亦遭震碎，而附近其學校之玻璃窗，及教室中之桌椅等，均被炸毀。現該區之煤氣管，電車路軌及電綫等，正在修理中，至當日傍晚大部份重要地區榮經修理竣事。記者並見該區有適當之防空壕設備，且曾發揮極大效力，故遇難者僅三名而巳。</p>
<h3>商統會機構　實行調整</h3>
<p>全國商業統制總會以戰時國用民需之物資異常重要，積極推進統制經濟施策尤屬必需，經自該會本身起以至所屬各統制會，均分照決定步驟，實施機構調整，人事配置，工作强化，務期迅速達成預定之目標。據悉商統會及米糧，粉麥，食用品，油糧，棉業等統制會近來對內對外之各項工作甚爲緊吸，除一般事務方面非常繁忙外，即其對於統制物資計劃，亦分別實施，加緊業務方面之收買工作，現管理指導事宜，益臻嚴密，統制機關澈底簡素化，經調整後已告完成，主管當局對於此項措施頗爲滿意。</p>

<h3>寳山縣警局　盧局長視事</h3>
<p>寳山縣警察局，前任局長因遺失城彈案伴離職，關於繼任人選，市政當局極端重視，經縣政管理處薦調現任警局一等警正處培繼任該縣局長。查處氏出身軍旅，事變前任公安局警察所長，參加和運後，仍繼續任職專員，前後連二年之久。處局長已於前（十六）日赴竇腹新，當即召集職員訓話，勉以治安爲重，注意防犯，　飭紀綱·刻苦耐勞，並格遵周兼市長調示，不客再有會送細勒索存在。</p>
<h3>各業新組公會　可申請核許</h3>

<h3>賭窟案主犯　王茂亭翻供　李分局發表真相</h3>
<p>關於「俄僑總會」賭窟案，自經警局破廢並將窟主王茂亭，經理衛華卿等拘獲，已依法懲辦。惟於地方法地開番時案時，窟主王茂亭竟反前供，對「窟主」及「行賄」罪，均予否認。且對行賄部份，供述由於新成分局李分局長向其捐募警察福利社經費，尤其捐認三十萬元，而給李大陸銀行支票三十萬，並非賄賂一節，各界咸表懷疑。記者昨特走訪李分局長，詢以十案真相，據答：「關於王茂亭之開設賭窟，糾衆聚賭。已供認不謂。至於行賄部份，亦由其供認，而在法院時所述由於木人向其捐募警察福利社資金一節，更屬荒謬。茲查警察福利社之籌募資　，尚爲去年之事，於周兼局長接任後，即撥養金一萬萬元，會公佈於報端，毋庸仰求捐募，再既爲捐款，當有收據，然則其收據何在，當可呈院檢騐。同時損款爲光榮之舉，何必在局偵察時，不加申述而供認行賄。總之，事實照彰，終難矇蔽法院富局，必要時本人可到庭對斥，常無司狡賴」。</p>

<h3>特魯曼強詞曲解　企圖蒙蔽世界　松平部長駁斥氏咨文</h3>
<p>盟邦日本大使館上海事務所，昨日下午循例舉行報道會議，松平情報部長對美新總統特魯曼送達議會之咨文，發表感想數點。茲誌大要如次：</p>
<p>咨文要點</p>
<p>美國新總統特魯曼，昨文，送達議會。向例美國總統於每年一月議會開會時，於咨文中申明其施政方針，是以特魯曼於就任之始，亦徇例以咨文送達議會，其咨文中包括之要點如次：</p>
<p>認故維斯福總統為和平理想之主動者，表示非常崇敬，並謂欲謀世界和平，必須羅氏領導，始能完成。</p>
<p>故羅斯福總統主張眞正之安全，應基及法律及正養。</p>
<p>為維持美國人之生活方式，為擁護自由，應繼續努力，推動整個世界人類之解放。</p>
<p>對美國陸軍及海軍首腦，表示嘉獎，並解說戰爭現狀。</p>
<p>表示不能與破壞和平者，共同討論和平機權問題。</p>
<p>强國之責任不在征服世界，而為對世界服役。最後特魯曼要求議會議員，一致協力。</p>
<p>部長感想</p>
<p>松平部長就特魯曼之咨文，發表感想云：</p>
<p>特氏咨文臚舉各點，雖似詳賅，但總覺過於抽象而偏重於辯解一方面，如何爲世界人類諜進步發農之新的總想，却未提及。</p>
<p>美國雖一再以法律與正義作爲口頭禪，但實際上所表現者爲對中允國之壓迫，尤其對中南美各國之剝削，飲對美國國內之黑人及亞洲人，種種不平等待迎，故無論如何。高唱法律與正義，不值識者一笑。</p>
<p>所謂强國之實任不在征服世界，而在爲世界服役，但何以對日德兩國主張無條件之屈服。此種主張，固與征服何異耶？如此偏面解決時局之方法，利用美妙辭句，以遂其關蔽世界及寶踐無條件屈服之野心，昭然若揭。</p>
<p>所謂破壞和平者係誰？大束亞戰爭爆發前，美國給予我人以與戰爭同樣之種種壓迫，飲被壞我人之和平交涉，致不得不訴諸戰爭。</p>
<p>總之，世界發生戰爭之原因，由於世界各國土地與人口之問，不能獲得生活資源之平衡支配而起，美人既不根究其原因所在，反而唯我屬尊，大言不慚，有識之士，其誰信之耶？</p>
<h3>美國新任大總統—特魯曼</h3>
<p>（中央社摘釋自美國「時代」雜誌）</p>
<p>美國人民所喜愛的，是一個不作無謂紛攪的，不小題大做的副總統。他應在他任期內盡心服務，到了後來，就安逸地匿名隱居起來。一個副總統有用的時候，就在當總統逝世的時候，美國歷史中曾有六個德統故世，有一句差不多像美國共和國歷史那樣久的俗語說：「總統與副總統之間，相差不過一下心跳。」</p>
<p>於是在一九四四年，一般共和黨選到了哈萊·特魯曼做副總統—個共和黨黨員，密蘇里州出來的後生。</p>
<p>「反新政策派報」曾經考查過特魯曼的一生徑歷和他的背景，然而在沒有考查之前，一般人都己知道特魯曼有兩個主要的矛盾的地方：</p>
<p>他是一個康薩斯地方著名的壞蛋本特加斯特手下的得意親信。</p>
<p>特魯曼在參院國防計劃調查委員會裏是一個很好的主席。</p>
<p>特魯曼愛穿雙排鈕扣的灰色西裝，他的大學教育不過簡短地在康蔭斯市立法律學院中渡過，他是一個並不面淸目秀的人，而他賦有一副溫和的性格，薄薄的嘴唇，厚邊的眼鏡，一口密蘇里地方的土語。在三十三歲前，他在他父親的田園裹工作，後來從政治的舞台上竄起來了—一個尖眼的政治投機家。他是粗魯的，平凡的，像一雙舊皮鞋一樣，</p>
<p>他每晚總是穿着一發睡衣，和新聞記者們玩着撲克牌，他最愛飲　啤酒，他是一個貪吃者，但是他仍能穿下他那套在第一次世界大戰時所做的軍服，他身高五尺，腰圍三十三寸，重一六七磅。（未完）</p>

<h3>The Japanese Army Achieves a Great Victory in the Waters Around Okinawa Main Island; 31 Enemy Ships Sunk or Destroyed in Three Days</h3>
<p>Announcement by the Imperial General Headquarters</p>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Imperial General Headquarters announced at 4 PM on the 17th: (1) The brave fighting of the Japanese air force and the defending troops on Okinawa Main Island complemented each other in the continued attacks on enemy warships and mobile units around the island. From April 14th to 16th, repeated fierce attacks were launched on the enemy units, inflicting heavy damage. Sudden attacks were also made on the northern and central airfields on the island, causing fires in 32 locations and throwing the enemy into great confusion. The results of the battle on the Japanese side that have been confirmed are as follows: 2 battleships sunk, 1 battleship or cruiser sunk, 1 large ship (believed to be an aircraft carrier) sunk, 2 cruisers sunk, 2 destroyers sunk, 8 ships of unknown type sunk (one of which is believed to be an aircraft carrier), 1 large ship (believed to be an aircraft carrier) destroyed, 3 transport ships sunk, and 8 ships of unknown type sunk. Most of the air force units participating in these attacks were special attack units. (2) On the night of April 15th, Japanese special water attack units attacked enemy ships in the waters off Kadena, sinking 2 ships of unknown type and destroying another one.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Japanese air force and special water attack units continued to fiercely attack enemy ships near Okinawa Island. In the three days of the 14th, 15th, and 16th, 18 ships were sunk and 13 were damaged. Since the start of the Okinawa Island battle, the total number of enemy ships sunk and damaged has reached 378.</p>
<h3>Enemy Mobile Unit Attempts to Move Again</h3>
<p>Japanese Military Base in the Southwest Pacific, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The enemy fleet around Okinawa Main Island is struggling to support the land-based enemy troops and is forcibly rising up to carry out cover operations. According to reconnaissance results on the 16th, enemy ships were discovered in the waters southeast of Kikai Island, including 2 regular aircraft carriers and 2 battleships. Slightly to the south, there was 1 regular aircraft carrier and 1 special attack aircraft carrier. Further south, there was another similar group with special aircraft carriers. There were three enemy mobile units, each with 1 regular aircraft carrier as its core. In addition, there was another unit patrolling around the Yaeyama Islands. Furthermore, near the Kerama Islands, 2 special aircraft carriers were discovered, bringing the total number of aircraft carriers to between 12 and 14, watching for an opportunity to strike. In the central waters around Okinawa Main Island, there was 1 cruiser, 4 destroyers, and about 100 transport ships. Several of the transport ships were on fire and burning, visible from land. In the waters near the northern airfield, there was a group fleet with 13 or 14 cruisers, 25 destroyers, and a number of minesweepers as its main force, relentlessly firing on the Japanese land defenses.</p>
<h3>Japanese Special Attack Units Launch Three General Offensives</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a report from a special correspondent at a naval base: From the 16th, the Japanese air force began its third general offensive against the enemy fleet near Okinawa Island and the enemy mobile unit off the coast of Amami Ōshima. On the same day, army bomber units bombed and strafed enemy small and medium-sized bombers at the northern and central airfields. The next morning, Japanese air control units and Kamikaze special attack units launched a large-scale sortie from their bases. One unit crashed into the enemy fleet near the Kerama Islands, sinking 1 large ship and several other warships. Another special attack unit fiercely attacked two mobile units off the southeastern coast of Amami Ōshima, consisting of 2 aircraft carriers, 3 battleships, and more than a dozen other warships. In an attempt to contain the Japanese special attack units' general offensive, the enemy raided airfields in various parts of Kyushu at 10 AM and 1 PM. The attacking enemy planes numbered only a few dozen, including several medium-sized North American B25 bombers. In the afternoon, Japanese special attack units continued to sortie, flying over the southeastern coast of Amami Ōshima to attack 2 enemy aircraft carriers, 3 large ships, and several other warships.</p>
<p>Ryukyu Islands Base, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Japanese army and navy special attack units are continuing their brave collision attacks against the enemy mobile unit gathered around Okinawa Island. The results of the attacks on the night of the 16th, as far as have been determined so far, include 1 cruiser sunk, 1 ship of unknown type sunk, 1 cruiser damaged, and 1 battleship or cruiser damaged.</p>
<h3>The Emperor Bestows Compassion on Disaster Victims; Issues a Gracious Imperial Rescript</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - His Majesty the Emperor, concerned about those suffering from war disasters, has bestowed a gracious Imperial Rescript, which was recently announced by the Imperial Household Ministry as follows:</p>
<p>As the war situation becomes increasingly critical, the enemy's aggression against our national territory is becoming more severe. I am deeply saddened to learn that subjects of the Imperial Nation have lost their lives, suffer from injuries, or have become bankrupt and unemployed, and that their lives are precarious. Therefore, I contribute money from my private funds to provide for the review of relief efforts. Each of you officials should deeply understand my intention and spread it to the populace so that my wishes may be fulfilled.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - His Majesty the Emperor, concerned about the people under enemy air raids, previously dispatched personnel to inspect the situation on the ground and personally visited the disaster-stricken areas of Tokyo on March 18th. However, as enemy air raids have become more frequent in recent times and the number of victims has increased, the Emperor issued a gracious Imperial Rescript to the affected people on the 17th and granted 10 million yen from the national treasury for relief purposes. Prime Minister Suzuki entered the palace at 9 AM to receive the Imperial Rescript and then withdrew. Subsequently, the Prime Minister received the donation from Minister of the Imperial Household Matsudaira.</p>
<h3>The Battle for Air Supremacy Enters a Decisive Phase; The Japanese Army's Counterattack on Okinawa Island is Fierce</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese air force's attacks on enemy mobile units and ships in the waters off Okinawa became even more intense after the 15th. Japanese special attack units, led by new fighter squadrons, launched fierce attacks day and night, engulfing the war zone in massive explosions and pillars of fire. The resistance of enemy carrier-based aircraft is gradually weakening. Despite the continuous attacks by the Japanese army, the enemy cannot ignore the survival of its land forces, so it stubbornly continues to reinforce and resupply them, adopting a do-or-die tactic. The enemy is also attempting to cut off the Japanese air force's rear support lines, using carrier-based aircraft to bomb Kyushu and B29 bombers to support and strengthen its bombing strategy of the Japanese mainland. The number of enemy planes attacking Kyushu on the 16th sharply decreased to just over 50. At the same time, enemy medium and small-sized aircraft stationed at the northern and central airfields on Okinawa Main Island have been suppressed by the Japanese air and land forces, limiting their ability to operate. Thus, the battle for air supremacy has entered a decisive phase. The dramatic reduction in direct support from enemy carrier-based aircraft during the Okinawa operation and the sluggish activity of enemy base air power are very obvious. All of this is due to the brave fighting of the Japanese special attack units, which has left the enemy land forces without support and has entered a major decisive phase.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese army's counterattack on Okinawa Island is becoming increasingly fierce. In the southern area, enemy forces are preparing to attack Japanese positions in front of Shuri. The Japanese army has been carrying out attacks daily. On the morning of the 16th, due to heavy losses on the front lines, the enemy replaced the troops with units from the rear. The General Headquarters has announced that the Japanese army killed a total of 1,700 enemy soldiers from the 12th to the 15th. However, it was later discovered that another 40 soldiers had been killed by the Japanese army. On the morning of the 15th, the enemy attacked Japanese positions under artillery support. The Japanese army engaged them in battle for six hours and then repelled them. On the other hand, the enemy landed on Minna Island at around 11 AM on the 15th, and the enemy also attempted to land on Ie Island.</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Attack Kyushu; Investigation of Interception Results Underway</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Approximately 80 enemy B29 bombers attacked Kyushu at 2 PM on the 17th, bombing various airfields. They retreated after an hour and a half. The Japanese authorities are currently investigating the results of the interception battle. The purpose of this enemy air raid appears to be to attack the Japanese air power base, and its tactics are noteworthy.</p>
<h3>Enemy Bombing of Shrines is a Planned Action</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Following the previous enemy bombing of the Ise Grand Shrine in Japan, the Meiji Shrine was bombed again at dawn on the 14th. This shows that the enemy's attacks are a planned action. During the air raid on the 14th, not a single bomb was dropped in the vicinity of Yoyogi and Harajuku. Only incendiary bombs, approximately 1,300 in number, were dropped on the shrine. The enemy planes targeted only the main hall and the worship hall, which are very small areas within the vast shrine grounds surrounded by trees. Approximately 750 incendiary bombs have been unearthed in the burnt-out areas of the main hall and worship hall. The personnel protecting the shrine at the time made every effort to put out the fire, but some of the firefighting equipment was damaged by the bombing and could not be used. Before long, the fire spread to the main hall and worship hall. It appears that the enemy's intention is to destroy the central faith of the Japanese people. However, the Japanese people are united in their desire for revenge and are working hard to clean up the fire site. The work was largely completed by the 16th. Construction of a new main hall has begun at the shrine, and the divine seat will be temporarily placed in the treasure hall. Within a day or two, the general public will be able to visit and worship again.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Following the indiscriminate bombing of the Ise Grand Shrine on January 14th by enemy planes, the Japanese government has decided to promptly carry out restoration work. A cabinet meeting was held on the 17th, and 472,000 yen was allocated from the second reserve fund to repair the Kagura hall, the Purification hall, and other damaged buildings.</p>
<h3>Japanese Citizens Organize Special Attack Units to Fulfill the Mission of Defending the Nation; Alliance Ceremony Scheduled for the 25th</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese people across the country have decided to organize the All-Japan National Special Attack Unit to repel the enemy invading the homeland. The founding ceremony and alliance ceremony are scheduled to be held at the Japan Pavilion in the Nakano Ward of Tokyo at 1 PM on the 25th. This organization is responding to the organizational policy of the National Volunteer Corps. It does not take any formal form but rises up automatically to defend the country. In the future, it will become the center of the National Volunteer Corps and fulfill its social responsibilities.</p>
<h3>The Battle of Laohekou and the Situation on the Mainland</h3>
<p>Recently, there are two points in the East Asian war situation that are particularly noteworthy: The first is that the enemy America's offensive against Okinawa Island has slowed down somewhat after suffering heavy losses. Therefore, they have had to resort to a strategy of terror air raids, vainly attempting to disrupt the rear. The second is that on the Chinese mainland, the Allied forces are still maintaining their initiative and advantage, and their future is noteworthy. Now, let's briefly elaborate on the new situation on the Chinese mainland battlefield:</p>
<p>The so-called general counteroffensive on the mainland, or the June general offensive, can be roughly divided into three zones. The first is the Southwest Counteroffensive Line, with the Burma battlefield as its general base, including Burma, Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Hunan, and even Vietnam and Thailand. The second is the Central China Counteroffensive Line, centered on the Central Plains, i.e., the Fifth War Zone, attempting to cross the Pinghan and Yuehan railways eastward, extending north to the Yellow River and south to the south bank of the Yangtze River. The third counteroffensive line is the offensive in various coastal areas of Southeast China, actively increasing troops with the dual aim of intercepting the Japanese army and cooperating with the Allied forces' landing operations. In addition, the Communist army also has the ambition to launch attacks in North China and along the coast of Central China in order to cooperate with the so-called general counteroffensive and take the opportunity to expand its power.</p>
<p>Apart from the Communist's planned counteroffensive, which will be discussed separately, among the three counteroffensive lines of the anti-Axis strategic plan jointly devised by the Americans and Chongqing, the Central China line is undoubtedly the most important. Recently, Liu Zhi, a direct descendant of the Chongqing Central Government, was transferred to replace Li Zongren as commander of the Fifth War Zone. Furthermore, efforts are being made to expedite the completion of the Stilwell Road in order to actively increase the direct supply of American military supplies to the Fifth War Zone. The Fifth War Zone, the center of this counteroffensive strategic focus, is actively promoting various military deployments with Laohekou as its center. However, the Japanese army had discovered this attempt in advance, so they launched a counterattack last month and occupied Nanyang to the northeast, and several days ago, they occupied Laohekou, striking the heart of the Central China counteroffensive. From this point, the Japanese army can take Laohekou as its center, with Yichang to the left and Luoyang to the right, spreading its wings westward to cut off the transportation between Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces, threatening Yan'an to the north and encircling the rear of Chongqing to the south. Clearly, the enemy's general counteroffensive plan has been shattered in advance.</p>
<p>As for the so-called Southwest Counteroffensive Line, which is the general base for the general counteroffensive, nearly 100,000 intellectual youths have been mobilized and are receiving training from the Americans in Yunnan and other places. Many have also joined the expeditionary force to India and Burma. The Chongqing army, which has been re-equipped and reorganized by the Americans, is also concentrated in the southwest region. There have also been recent reorganizations in the command structure. Its future is noteworthy. However, the Japanese army in various areas of Burma, Vietnam, and Thailand is closely monitoring the enemy, and the Japanese army in Hunan and Guangxi has not relaxed its efforts to contain the enemy for a moment. Recently, a new offensive has been launched against Zhijiang in the southwest of Hunan Province, and the enemy's Southwest Counteroffensive Line is about to suffer a frontal breakthrough.</p>
<p>In the southeastern coastal area, the American and Chongqing forces have recently been actively increasing their strength, and the enemy's aircraft in that area are most active. Recently, attacks on cities along the Yuehan Railway and coastal port cities above Hong Kong and Guangzhou have also become more frequent. However, all major coastal cities from Shanghai to Hong Kong are under the protection of the Japanese army, and the defense capabilities have been further strengthened in the past month or two. Furthermore, further progress along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway can be achieved at any time, so the enemy's attempts are not worth worrying about.</p>
<p>In short, the current situation on the mainland battlefield is about to undergo a major development with the occupation of Laohekou by the Allied forces as a turning point. As long as the overall situation on the mainland battlefield is stable, preventing the Americans from achieving their desires, then the enemy's movements on the ocean will only suffer heavy losses, leading to their eventual collapse. The more impatient the enemy becomes, the more calmly and resolutely we must respond.</p>
<h3>Recent Observations on International Politics</h3>
<p>— Nan Gong</p>
<p>Recently, two major events have occurred internationally: One is the Soviet Union's notification to Japan that it will not extend the Neutrality Pact, and the other is the death of US President Roosevelt. Before discussing the future of Japanese-Soviet neutrality relations, we should first observe the development of anti-Axis relations. The cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom and the United States is superficial. There are many contradictions on specific issues, and there is no possibility of uniting to the end. In addition, after Roosevelt's death, the anti-Axis alliance lacks an influential figure who can harmonize the opinions of various countries. Because the UK, the US, and the Soviet Union cannot cooperate closely, the relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union will not undergo unexpected changes, and neutrality can continue to be maintained. Let's first discuss the relationship between the anti-Axis countries:</p>
<p>(1) The relationship between the anti-Axis countries</p>
<p>The relationship between the US, the UK, and the Soviet Union has been greatly affected by Roosevelt's death. Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin appeared to be united in their opinions, but in reality, Churchill and Stalin had conflicting opinions. The Soviet Encyclopedia even noted that Churchill was the most anti-Soviet person in England. Only Roosevelt could gradually bring Churchill and Stalin closer. Now that Roosevelt has passed away, although Truman has succeeded as President of the United States, the US has lost a central figure, and the close ties between the three countries have been considerably affected by Roosevelt's death.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's notification to Japan that it will not extend the Neutrality Pact was one of the decisions made at the Yalta Conference, that is, the request of the US and the UK. The exchange condition was that the US and the UK recognize the Soviet Union's right of freedom in a certain important area of East Asia. The aforementioned conditions have been revealed by the United Press, the New York Times, and British newspapers, saying that this is a major concession by the US and the UK to the Soviet Union. This is of great importance to Chongqing, but since it was not notified in advance, it is naturally dissatisfied. Because Chongqing did not participate in the Yalta Conference, it did not say a word other than expressing dissatisfaction with the free resolution of this issue by the three countries. From this point, we can also see the lack of unity among the United Nations. The UK has little interest in this area, while the US has ambitions for this area. The concession to the Soviet Union this time is probably due to the difficulties of their own manpower and resources.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of Poland's participation in the San Francisco Conference, the US, the UK, and the Soviet Union had already reached an agreement at the Yalta Conference to set up a temporary government in Poland. After the three countries recognized it, they could send representatives to participate. Afterward, the Soviet Union suddenly overturned the decision and demanded that the Lublin government send representatives to participate. The US and the UK believed that this matter had already been decided at the Yalta Conference and should not be changed, so they rejected the Soviet request. This issue has not been resolved to this day. From this, we can see that the Yalta Conference seemed very satisfactory on the surface, but the consultation on specific issues was not yet satisfactory. American newspapers therefore heavily criticized the government's hasty actions. Regarding the issue of organizing a new international league, the three countries' opinions were also not the same on voting. At the Yalta Conference, it was decided that the US, the UK, and the Soviet Union would have absolute authority in the league's council, and that the US and the Soviet Union would each have three votes in the plenary meeting. American public opinion also strongly attacked this, wanting to overturn it. Because the UK, including Canada, New Zealand, Australia, India, and South Africa, has a total of six votes, the US and the Soviet Union demanded three votes in order to counter the UK. From this, we can see a glimpse of the conflict of interests with each other.</p>
<p>The domestic trends in the US and the UK are also important issues. In the United States, the most important thing is the opposition between the government and Congress. Regarding the handling of Pacific islands, the US Congress and the military both advocate permanent occupation, but Roosevelt decided at the Yalta Conference that they would be jointly managed internationally. If Roosevelt had not died, this kind of opposition could have been handled smoothly. Now that Truman has succeeded as President, his political skills are far inferior to Roosevelt's. It is expected that the relationship between the US government and Congress will become more complicated. Since opinions within the United States are divided, treaties that it makes with foreign countries will be affected and difficult to take effect. The US sent nine representatives to the San Francisco Conference. Apart from the Secretary of State, the Democratic Party and the Republican Party each had four people. This is the US government's intention to have both parties share responsibility.</p>
<p>Before the San Francisco Conference, the UK had already held a meeting in London. New Zealand and Australia opposed the League's council having too much power, which shows the lack of unity of opinion within the UK. The Indian issue is also an important event. Because the Atlantic Charter does not apply to India, when the Viceroy of India Wavell returned to London to discuss this issue, he believed that if the Indian issue was not resolved satisfactorily, there was a possibility of a third world war. This also shows the seriousness of the UK's internal problems. After the start of the war, the UK planned to form a coalition government with the Conservative Party and the Labour Party, but now the Labour Party has suddenly begun to attack the government, which is a sign that the two parties are about to split. The result of the development of this kind of domestic situation in the US and the UK will greatly reduce the opportunity for the two countries to assist each other. The cooperation between the US, the UK, and the Soviet Union is only superficial. In fact, they do not agree on specific issues.</p>
<p>(2) The future of Japanese-Soviet relations</p>
<p>The Japanese-Soviet relationship can be understood from the perspective of both sides. (1) From the Soviet perspective, its opinion is indeed the same as the US and the UK in terms of fighting Germany, but its opinion is not the same on Eastern issues. Furthermore, the future direction of the Soviet Union can be observed from its domestic situation. The Soviet Union suffered too much damage in this four-year war. It goes without saying that it is distressed. The post-war reconstruction issue is the issue that needs to be resolved urgently in the future. The Soviet Union has signed a 20-year mutual assistance treaty with the United Kingdom, which shows that its post-war reconstruction work is very important. The Soviet Union has also requested a loan of hundreds of millions of US dollars from the United States. The Soviet Union's current requirement is "need to rest."</p>
<p>(2) From the Japanese perspective, although the Soviet Union has notified that the Neutrality Pact will no longer be extended, Japan is still seeking to maintain a neutral relationship in good faith, because the treaty will not expire until April next year. The recent change of cabinet in Japan, with Togo taking over as Foreign Minister, has attracted much attention from the US and the UK. Togo is wise and insightful in the Japanese political and diplomatic circles. The Soviet Union also has a good understanding of Mr. Togo. From the Soviet perspective and Japan's statement of good faith, the future relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union can be foreseen.</p>
<p>(3) Conclusion</p>
<p>In summary, Japan's estimate of the importance of the war situation is not an overestimate, but Japan's goal of liberating the Greater East Asia War must be carried through to the end, and the Japanese people have also ignited the fire of fighting to the end. The more intense the war, the clearer the goal, and they will work hard to achieve it.</p>

<h3>German Leader Appeals to Soldiers and Civilians to Exert All Efforts to Resist the Enemy; Soviet Forces 45 Kilometers from Berlin</h3>
<p>Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Huitong News: The German leader Hitler yesterday issued an appeal to officers and soldiers on the Eastern Front to resist the Red Army's massacres. It stated, in brief, that Berlin is still in German hands, Vienna will still belong to the Germans, and Europe will never be subject to the Russians. The current great war is indeed a disastrous calamity ordained by fate, but there is bound to be a turning point in the war situation. The leader's words were filled with steadfast passion. The leader continued in a sharp tone, saying that any soldier who fails to fulfill his mission under these circumstances is a traitor to the German people. What face do those who fail to hold their ground, be it a platoon or a division, and abandon it have to face the women and children who are enduring terrifying bombings? From now on, anyone who orders a retreat without authorization will be arrested on the spot, regardless of their rank, and, if necessary, executed on the spot.</p>
<p>Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Huitong News: From Kustrin in the north to the confluence of the Neisse and Oder rivers in the south, Soviet forces launched a large-scale offensive at 3:30 AM yesterday.

<p>Travel Correspondence</p>
<h3>Governor Hao Pengju Discusses Political Reform in Huaihai</h3>
<p>— Yifei</p>
<p>Huaihai Notes, Part Two</p>
<p>On the afternoon of April 5th, this reporter visited Governor Hao Pengju of Huaihai Province at the provincial government. When I was led into his "outer office," the first thing that caught my attention was two framed items hanging high on the wall: Governor Hao's handwritten "Oath for the Renewal of Life for Military and Political Personnel in Huaihai Province" and "Creed for Administrative Personnel in Huaihai Province." The oath begins with these touching words: "Today, the things that can ruin our noble character and glorious career are selfishness, hypocrisy, decadence, disunity, frivolity, and sloppiness, as well as lack of order, discipline, wasting time, wasting public property, and not keeping to schedules." This is precisely Governor Hao's model for building a new Huaihai.</p>
<p>In my imagination, Governor Hao was always some typical military man—authoritarian and impetuous. But when I stepped into his office, I was surprised to find before me an amiable and cultivated leader.</p>
<p>I first asked for his views on the construction of a new Huaihai and the "Youth Politics" movement currently being promoted. Governor Hao replied, "In this era when war clouds engulf every corner of the world, there is only destruction, and construction is out of the question. However, although Huaihai Province has been in a difficult environment for years, it has still been able to work hard and diligently in the construction of various departments. Just looking at the buildings in Xuzhou City and the opening of roads and dredging of rivers, there has been an average increase of 30 to 40 percent compared to before. It must be known that construction materials are extremely scarce in Huaihai Province. It is not easy to achieve such slight achievements under such difficult circumstances, which is somewhat gratifying.</p>
<p>"In the past, the political power of the Huaihai Provincial Government could completely reach the organizational cells at the lower levels without any barriers. Based on the achievements of recent years, more than two-thirds of the staff in the lower political echelons have received political training. In order to reassure them in their posts, we have broken the bad habit in our officialdom of 'a new emperor, a new courtier.' Therefore, even when the county magistrate is transferred, none of his subordinates are changed. Furthermore, county governments have long established treasuries separately, and accounting is completely independent, implementing a unified collection and disbursement system. The county government's economy is consolidated, and administrative operations can be carried out smoothly. This has been the consistent policy of Huaihai Province in the past. Recently, in order to thoroughly build a greater Huaihai, it was decided to implement 'Youth Politics.' The so-called Youth Politics is to use the youthful and vigorous spirit of young people as the driving force for promoting politics, and to use decisive and swift methods to eliminate the feudal remnants within Huaihai Province that hinder the construction of the new Huaihai. Such as eradicating local bullies and corruption, correcting folk customs, implementing compulsory education, raising the level of popular intelligence, and cultivating various talents. Currently, this political reform movement is being planned and promoted, and the date of implementation is not far off. It is planned to first train a group of high school graduates politically and then send them to various counties as administrative assistants. This measure has two goals: (1) to use the enthusiasm of youth to train the masses, so that they can be good citizens and cooperate with the government's ideals; (2) to use young people as the basic cadres to lead all difficult work. Therefore, 'Youth Politics' is to promote politics with a revolutionary spirit, in other words, it is the overall mobilization of the spirit of Huaihai Province, striving to achieve the ideal state of perfection." (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Decided to Prosecute Illegal Profiteering Merchants; Economic Police Authorities Strive to Suppress and Stabilize Prices</h3>
<p>The prices of all goods in this city have soared recently, especially the black market price of rice, which has exceeded 15 [currency unit], causing a serious threat to the people's livelihood. Some illegal merchants are only trying to make exorbitant profits, taking the opportunity to raise prices without any regard for the people's livelihood, which has aroused great indignation from all walks of life. In order to thoroughly eliminate such illegal activities, the Economic Police authorities of this city held an emergency meeting at 11:00 AM on the 17th. After careful deliberation, they have come up with considerable measures and are determined to prosecute these illegal merchants. They will dispatch all economic police to conduct strict inspections of markets, shops, and firms throughout the city. Eleven major items must be sold in accordance with the limited prices assessed by the Commodity Evaluation Committee, and other items must also be sold in accordance with the prices agreed upon by the relevant trade associations. Any violations will be severely punished, and citizens are encouraged to report violations in order to combat rising prices and stabilize the people's livelihood.</p>
<h3>Minister Zhou Sends Personnel to Thoroughly Investigate Stock Exchange Conditions; Strictly Prohibiting Off-Exchange Transactions by Brokers</h3>
<p>Recently, the surge in the prices of various securities in this city has been severe, disrupting finance, affecting the market, and harming the people's livelihood. It is reported that Minister Zhou of the Ministry of Finance has ordered Li Ji, Zhang Gu, and Zhang Zhonghuan of the Financial Affairs Inspection Office, together with Xu Jiang, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Economic Bureau, and the Stock Exchange Supervisory Office, to thoroughly investigate the securities trading situation at the exchange and report to be examined, approved and implemented to stabilize the market.</p>
<p>Minister Zhou also issued a hand order to the stock exchange, ordering the suspension of convenient trading from the 17th. Now, on the 17th, he issued another hand order to the exchange: Strictly prohibit stock exchange brokers from engaging in off-exchange transactions. Once discovered, the license will be revoked for serious violations, and operations will be suspended for minor violations. Strictly prohibit people other than brokers from trading at the stock exchange. The exchange's gatekeepers must be strict.</p>
<p>Afternoon Trading Advanced Settlement</p>
<p>According to news from the stock exchange yesterday, the exchange had been allowing brokers and customers to settle afternoon trades on the afternoon of the following day. Now, with the stock market fluctuating, in order to crack down on speculative profiteers engaged in buying and selling short, from the 17th onwards, all afternoon trades must be settled on the morning of the following day. Failure to comply with the settlement will result in immediate suspension of trading.</p>
<p>It is also learned that due to Mayor Zhou's hand order to suspend convenient trading, all brokers and securities firms at the exchange complied with the order on the 17th. Customer deposits will be refunded separately on the 18th.</p>
<h3>Situation in Bombed Areas in the Northern Part of This City</h3>
<p>At around 4:00 AM on the 15th of this month, an enemy plane attacked Shanghai, indiscriminately dropping bombs in a certain area in the north. A Central News Agency reporter went to inspect the scene and saw that the roofs and floors of many houses and shops that were destroyed had been penetrated. Broken signboards, twisted beams, and rubble were everywhere. A bomb exploded in the middle of the road, shattering the windows of buildings even at a great distance. The glass windows and desks and chairs in the nearby school were also destroyed. The gas pipes, streetcar tracks, and power lines in the area are currently being repaired, and most of the important areas were repaired by the evening of that day. The reporter also saw that the area had adequate air-raid shelter facilities, which had played a great role, so only three people were killed.</p>
<h3>Reorganization of the General Association for Commercial Control's Organization</h3>
<p>The General Association for Commercial Control of the Nation believes that wartime materials for national use and people's needs are extremely important, and actively promoting controlled economic policies is essential. The association has implemented organizational adjustments, personnel deployments, and work enhancements from the association itself to its affiliated control associations, in accordance with the decided steps, in order to quickly achieve the predetermined goals. It is reported that the General Association for Commercial Control and the control associations for rice, wheat flour, food, oil, and cotton have been very busy with various internal and external tasks recently. In addition to the very busy general affairs, they have also been implementing controlled materials plans and intensifying the procurement of goods. The management and guidance matters have become increasingly strict. The simplification of the control mechanism has been thoroughly completed after the adjustment, and the competent authorities are quite satisfied with this measure.</p>
<h3>Preparatory Meeting for Wartime Mass Meeting to be Held Today</h3>
<p>In response to the wartime mass representative meeting in the capital, and in accordance with the central government's telegram instructing all provinces and cities to hold the meeting simultaneously on April 21, all sectors of this city will hold the "Shanghai Special Municipality Wartime Mass Meeting" at 9:00 AM on that day at the Da Guangming Theater on Jing'an Temple Road. The meeting will be jointly prepared by the municipal party headquarters, the municipal social welfare bureau, and the municipal propaganda department. It has been decided that a preparatory meeting will be held at 2:30 PM today (the 18th) in the conference room of the municipal propaganda department to convene relevant agencies and organizations to discuss the proceedings.</p>
<h3>Director Lu Takes Office at the Baoshan County Police Bureau</h3>
<p>The previous director of the Baoshan County Police Bureau was dismissed due to the loss of city ammunition case. The municipal authorities attach great importance to the selection of his successor. After recommendation by the county administrative office, Chu Pei, the current first-class police officer of the police bureau, was transferred to succeed as the director of the county bureau. Chu comes from the military. Before the incident, he served as the director of the police station of the Public Security Bureau. After participating in the peace movement, he continued to serve as a commissioner for two consecutive years. Director Chu went to Baoshan on the 16th and immediately convened a meeting of officials to exhort them to focus on public security, pay attention to prevention, rectify discipline, endure hardships, and strictly abide by Mayor Zhou's instructions to ensure that there would be no more incidents of extortion.</p>
<h3>New Trade Associations Can Apply for Approval</h3>
<p>The Municipal Economic Bureau is actively carrying out the adjustment and strengthening of trade associations in this city, and is working according to the formulated plan. For those who have already submitted the survey forms to the bureau, they will be individually summoned to talk with the chairmen of each association and records will be made to serve as reference materials for reviewing the soundness and unsoundness of each association. It is learned that, in addition to the more than 220 units of trade associations that have been registered and approved for establishment (which are the trade associations that were approved for establishment by the former Social Movement Guidance Committee), those that have not yet registered with the bureau can still apply for registration procedures. Those who newly organize associations can also request approval for establishment. Whether to approve or not to approve the organization rests entirely with the bureau, and the nature of the bureau's work on adjusting and strengthening the trade associations is fundamentally different.</p>
<h3>News Association Held Second Current Affairs Discussion Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese News Association held its second current affairs and reporting discussion meeting at the Huajia Club yesterday (the 17th) afternoon at 4:00 PM, inviting Director Matsudaira of the Information Department to attend and provide guidance. The representatives of the News Association who attended included Akahoshi, and the representatives of the member newspaper offices of the branch included Takashima Seima of the Continental News, Chen Binshu of Shen Bao, Xu Liqiu and Yang Huilang of the China Daily, Ni Sun of Ping Bao, Zheng Jie of New China Daily, Chen Ribing and Lu Feng of Xinwen Bao, and Jiang Xiaoguang and Zhu Yongkang of the National News, He Daxiong of Xin Shen Bao, and more than ten others. Chen Binshu first reported on the significance of the theme of the current affairs discussion meeting, and then invited Director Matsudaira to elaborate on the trends in the world political situation after the death of Roosevelt, especially the impact on the San Francisco Conference, and the role of the Soviet Union's temporary change of the chief representative to the San Francisco Conference, which was very detailed. He also commented a lot on the fact that the new US President Truman did not attend the San Francisco Conference. Then, representatives of various member newspaper offices, such as Xu Liqiu and Lu Feng, successively raised various questions, which Director Matsudaira answered in detail one by one, and the meeting ended at around 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Wang Maoting, the Main Culprit in the Gambling Den Case, Retracts His Confession; Director Li of the New City Branch Publicly Announces the Truth</h3>
<p>Regarding the "Russian Emigrant General Association" gambling den case, the police bureau cracked it down and arrested the den owner Wang Maoting, manager Wei Huaqing, and others, who have been punished according to law. However, during the court hearing in the local court, the den owner Wang Maoting actually retracted his previous confession and denied the charges of "den owner" and "bribery." Moreover, regarding the bribery part, he stated that Director Li of the New City Branch was soliciting funds for the police welfare society from him, especially donating 300,000 yuan, and giving Li a 300,000 yuan check from the Continental Bank, which was not bribery. People from all walks of life expressed suspicion. Yesterday, the reporter specifically visited Director Li to inquire about the truth of the case. He replied: "Regarding Wang Maoting's opening of a gambling den and gathering people to gamble, he has confessed without denying it. As for the bribery part, he also confessed to it, and his statement in court that it was due to a mutual friend soliciting funds for the police welfare society is even more absurd. It is now found that the fundraising for the police welfare society was still last year. After Zhou took over as the director, he allocated 10,000 yuan for maintenance funds and announced it in the newspapers, so there was no need to solicit donations. Furthermore, since it was a donation, there should be a receipt, so where is the receipt? It can be presented to the court for inspection. At the same time, donating money is a glorious act, so why didn't he state it during the bureau's investigation and confess to bribery? In short, the facts are clear and it is ultimately difficult to deceive the court and the bureau. If necessary, I can go to court to confront him, and I will never allow him to quibble."</p>
<h3>Finance Bureau Revises Special Consumption Tax Rates; Effective from the 20th of This Month</h3>
<p>The Municipal Finance Bureau submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval the revision of the special tax rates for retail sales of goods and consumption of banquets and hotels, which will take effect from April 20 of this year. The bureau's announcement and revised articles are recorded below:</p>
<p>"It has been investigated that the Ministry of Finance's temporary regulations on special taxes on retail sales of goods and consumption of banquets and hotels should be revised.

Now, it is ordered to proceed according to the file, and it will be implemented in accordance with the newly revised articles from April 20 of this year, and it will be reported and separately sent to inform everyone."</p>

<h3>Register Self-Provided Engines</h3>
<p>The Municipal Construction Bureau believes that due to the reduction in electricity supply, various public places and factories in this city have installed engines, but all such installations must be registered and inspected in accordance with the regulations. However, most of the manufacturers in this city who have installed engines have not applied in accordance with the regulations, which is not in accordance with the law. In order to unify management, special regulations have been drawn up and approved by the municipal government to start registration immediately. All those in this city who have self-provided engines must apply for inspection to the second section of the bureau in accordance with the regulations before May 15. Those who fail to do so will be severely punished.</p>
<h3>Vehicle Registration Offices in Suburbs Abolished</h3>
<p>Regarding vehicle registration and inspection in the suburbs of this city, the former Public Works Bureau had vehicle registration offices. Since the establishment of the Construction Bureau, the administration of each county has long been unified, and vehicle registration work is difficult to command due to the distance. This work should be transferred to the county government for direct management. Therefore, the vehicle registration offices in each county will be abolished so that they can be handed over to the county government to take charge of the matter.</p>

<h3>Truman Distorts Words and Misinterprets, Attempting to Deceive the World; Minister Matsudaira Refutes His Message</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Office of the Allied Japan Embassy held a routine press conference yesterday afternoon. Information Minister Matsudaira expressed several points on the impressions of the message delivered to Congress by the new American President Truman. The main points are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Main Points of the Message</p>
<p>The new American President Truman delivered a message to Congress yesterday. As a rule, the US president clarifies his policy in the message to Congress in January of each year, so Truman also followed the example by sending a message to Congress at the beginning of his term. The main points included in his message are as follows:</p>
<p>He recognized President Roosevelt as the initiator of the ideal of peace, expressed great respect, and said that world peace must be led by Roosevelt in order to be completed.</p>
<p>The late President Roosevelt advocated that true security should be based on law and justice.</p>
<p>In order to maintain the American way of life and to uphold freedom, we should continue to strive to promote the liberation of all mankind in the world.</p>
<p>He praised the heads of the US Army and Navy and explained the current state of the war.</p>
<p>He stated that he could not discuss the issue of peace mechanisms with those who destroy peace.</p>
<p>The responsibility of a strong country is not to conquer the world, but to serve the world. Finally, Truman asked the members of Congress to cooperate unanimously.</p>
<p>Minister's Impressions</p>
<p>Minister Matsudaira expressed his impressions on Truman's message, saying:</p>
<p>Although the various points listed in Truman's message seem detailed, they are generally too abstract and focus too much on justification. It does not mention any new ideas on how to promote progress in the world and develop agriculture.</p>
<p>Although the United States has repeatedly used law and justice as its mantra, what it actually shows is oppression against neutral countries, especially exploitation against Central and South American countries, and various unequal treatments against blacks and Asians within the United States, so no matter what, chanting law and justice is not worth the smile of the wise.</p>
<p>The so-called responsibility of a strong country is not to conquer the world, but to serve the world, but why does it advocate unconditional surrender to Japan and Germany? Is this claim not different from conquest? This kind of one-sided method of resolving the situation, using beautiful words to achieve its ambition to deceive the world and practice unconditional surrender, is obvious.</p>
<p>Who are the so-called destroyers of peace? Before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the United States gave us various oppressions that were the same as war, and ruined our peace negotiations, so we had no choice but to resort to war.</p>
<p>In short, the cause of war in the world is due to the lack of balanced distribution of living resources between the land and population of various countries in the world. Americans do not investigate the cause, but instead only respect themselves and speak shamelessly. Who will believe it?</p>
<h3>The New President of the United States – Truman</h3>
<p>(An explanation from the American magazine "Time" by the Central News Agency)</p>
<p>The American people prefer a Vice President who doesn't stir up unnecessary troubles and doesn't make mountains out of molehills. He should diligently serve during his term, and then retire quietly into anonymity. A Vice President is useful when the President passes away. In American history, six presidents have died in office, and there's a saying almost as old as the history of the American Republic: "The difference between the President and the Vice President is just a heartbeat."</p>
<p>Thus, in 1944, the general electorate (Republican) chose Harry Truman as Vice President—a member of the Republican Party, a young man from Missouri.</p>
<p>The "Anti-New Deal newspapers" had investigated Truman's life and background. However, even before the investigation, people already knew two main contradictory aspects of Truman:</p>
<p>He was a trusted confidant of the notorious Kansas City boss, Pendergast.</p>
<p>Truman was an excellent chairman of the Senate Committee Investigating the National Defense Program.</p>
<p>Truman loved to wear double-breasted gray suits. His college education was only briefly spent at the Kansas City School of Law. He was not a handsome man, but he possessed a gentle character, thin lips, thick-rimmed glasses, and a Missouri drawl. Before the age of thirty-three, he worked on his father's farm, and then rose through the political ranks—a sharp-eyed political opportunist. He was rough, ordinary, like an old pair of shoes.</p>
<p>He always wore pajamas every night and played poker with reporters. He loved to drink beer, and he was a glutton, but he could still fit into his military uniform made during World War I. He was five feet tall, had a thirty-three-inch waist, and weighed 167 pounds. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Children's Dental Clinic Prevents Dental Problems for Students of Free Schools</h3>
<p>We received a letter yesterday from the staff of the Children's Dental Clinic, willing to provide free dental check-ups and treatments for students of the free schools run by this newspaper. The clinic's enthusiasm for service is truly admirable. The original letter is recorded as follows: "Your newspaper promotes free schools, benefiting underprivileged children, which is of profound significance. However, while children's education is undoubtedly important, their physical health should also not be neglected. In modern civilized countries, dental school doctors are invariably appointed, but our country still lacks this. Considering this, the staff of our clinic are willing to serve as volunteer dental school doctors for the first to tenth free schools run by your newspaper, in order to promote this. The regulations are as follows:</p>
<p>1.  To visit the school for oral examinations once or twice a year (the date is to be designated by the school).</p>
<p>2.  If treatment is required after the examination, with the consent of the parents, a certificate can be issued by the principal, and the parents can accompany the treatment.</p>
<p>3.  Temporary emergencies—such as oral trauma, toothache, tooth root decay, facial swelling, and various diseases in the mouth—can also be treated on a voluntary basis." (Note: The address of the Children's Dental Clinic is No. 11, Lane 54, Avenue Joffre (Xiafei Market), telephone number 7692).</p>
<h3>Donation Report for Free School Funds</h3>
<p>Jiangmin of the People's Cooperative donated 10,000 yuan, Bai Xiuqing donated 1,000 yuan, totaling 11,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Donation Report of this Newspaper</p>
<p>Medical and Recreational Fund: Dai Miaoying 5,000 yuan. Midwifery Fund: Wang Yiwu 5,000 yuan. Relief Fund for the Poor: Wang Yangwu 5,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Brief News</h3>
<p>The Chinese Educational Moral Society Relieves the Hidden Poor</p>

Each time, they receive one *sheng* (升, a unit of volume). Recently, applications have been quite enthusiastic. It is also learned that the society's small wooden loan office has also been expanded, and a special fund of one million yuan has been raised. The loan amounts have been increased to three types: 10,000 yuan, 5,000 yuan, and 3,000 yuan.</p>
