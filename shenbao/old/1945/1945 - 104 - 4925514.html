<h3>羅斯福患腦溢血症　前日在溫泉逝世　定今午舉行喪禮明日安葬</h3>
<p>里斯本十三日中央社電　據華盛頓來電，白宮於十二日夜發表稱：羅斯福（見圖）大總統已於十二日午後三時（上海十三日上午六時）患腦溢血症在溫泉逝肚。大總統在過去十天內已赴溫泉靜養，羅斯福逝世後，立即通知副總統特魯曼，特魯曼接獲急電後，即前赴白宮，由總統夫人詳告逝世經過。國務卿亦接得計報，當即召集國務會議，定十四日下午在白宮東廳舉行喪禮，十五日下午安葬於海德公園。</p>
<p>日內瓦十二日中央社電　德國社訊，華盛頓消息：襯斯福總統秘　歐來稱：羅斯福夫人及羅斯福之醫師麥伊泰，定今日下午飛往溫泉。</p>
<p>里斯本十三日中央社電　華盛頓來電，美大總統羅斯福之隨從醫師暇倫博士，發表羅斯福抱病經過如次：十二日上午九時三十分（中部戰時時間）大總統非常健康，毫無不良現象，下午一時前安坐於椅上，令畫師畫像，下午一時十五分即失去意識，直至一時三十分，余仍在大總統身旁，而終不見恢復意識，祗見其痛苦難訴，迨下午三時三十五分，遂溘然長逝。余於大總統喪失意識之同時，即報告華盛頓衛戍司令馬金噉氏，該司令當即邀請專門醫師巴林博士來診，迄該氏迢速抵達渥姊斯暇林克斯溫泉時，正大總統逝世之時，病中祇余與海軍少校秋休克斯隨侍，經診斷大總統之死因，乃為多量之腦出血。</p>
<h3>美國務院緊急决定　特魯曼繼任總統　發表首次咨文聲明繼續作戰對舊金山會議亦令照常舉行</h3>
<p>里斯本十三日中央社電　美國副總統特魯曼十二日下午五時二十五分接得白宮通知後，即乘汽車趕赴白宮，下午六時召集緊急國務會議，經討論結果，決定依照合衆國憲法第六十條之規定，由特魯曼副總統昇升第三十二任大總統，特魯曼即舉行宣誓就職，並要求國務院議員繼續留任。按特魯曼為密蘇里推事出身，一九三五年春開始實行國防計劃後，任上院軍需生產調查委員會委員長，努力增加軍需生產，克服幾多困難，實行國家總動員，在國會中樹立最大中心勢力，旋得羅斯福信任，被選為副總統，故預料彼今後施政方策仍將採取嚴峻之總動員方式，特魯曼今年六十一歲，前次大戰時任重砲兵聯隊砲兵大尉，赴前紅出征，具有實際作戰經騐。</p>
<p>里斯本十三日中央社電　據海通社訊：特魯曼現年至五月八日適為六十一歲，初於一九三四年十一月六日被選為參議員，一九四〇年十一月五日得連選，任期將至一九四七年一月三日滿期，上年夏季民主黨大會中，被推為副總統候選人。</p>
<p>里斯本十三日中央社電　十二日發表首次咨文，聲明美國將舉所有力量，在東西兩戰塲繼續作戰。</p>
<p>廣州十三日中央社電　據重慶轉播華盛頓消息，特魯曼請政府原有各部首長全體留任。又手諭國務院，舊金山會議須按照原定計劃，於二十五日舉行。又據重慶廣播，蔣聞羅斯福總統逝世消息，甚為悲痛，並發表感想，成羅斯福總統未竟之志。</p>
<p>里斯本十三日中央社電　美上院外交委員會主席康乃萊稱：聯合國討論世界安全機構之舊金山會議，或將因羅斯福之逝世而延期，但國務院則稱，舊金山會議，並不因大總統之死亡而中止舉行。</p>
<h3>羅斯福夫人　通知四子</h3>
<p>中央社訊　美國羅斯福總統逝世後，現在從軍中之羅斯福四子，自羅斯福夫人接到通知如下，「父於今日下午逝，羅斯福如吾等之期待，實行其事業，直至最後之剎那，望汝等前途幸福，吾等今後更應互相協力」。</p>
<h3>邱吉爾等　極為衝動</h3>
<p>里斯本十三日中央社電　羅斯福之噩耗，使英國朝野受到重大衝動，英國人民對此意外事故，莫不驚駭萬分，各國記者為探詢邱吉爾意見，特赴英政府訪問，但英政府當局告以邱吉爾接得細斯福計告後，極為衝動，故今日為余等值動，無法探詢首相意見。</p>
<p>里斯本十三日中央社電　據美聯社重慶特派員報告，蔣介石進早餐時，接到羅斯福逝世噩耗，呆然半晌，停止餐事，顯出悲痛面色。蔣氏曾於一九四三年在開羅會見羅斯福後，以羅氏為重慶之眞摯好友，抱着無限敬仰，渝方要人亦認為，羅斯福之逝世，反軸心受挫甚大。又對羅氏未見戰事結東，遽而作古，殊為可惜。</p>
<h3>反軸心陣營受重大影響</h3>
<p>東京十三日中央社電　羅斯福之急逝，因時值反軸心國正急於完成戰爭之重大時期，故在於反軸心言，恰如晴天霹　。羅斯福自歐戰勃發以來，積極援助英國，同時並危害日本在東亞之立塲，更採收敵對行為，竟使日本不得不為自衛而執干戈，引起世界大戰，渠實為造成戰爭之罪魁。彼又為　信侵略的海軍主義者及經濟帝國主義者，而擾亂世界和平之主角，至於政治手腕，實為美國歷代總統中之傑出人才。羅斯福在新產業政策後，重建國內體制以及推展美國外交政策時，均會充份發揮非凡之才能，其於此次戰爭上，復為指導反軸心陣營之首領，故彼之急逝，全美國內之打擊極重且大。羅斯福死後之美政界，已失去戰爭最高指導者，而逐次陷於混亂，今後特魯曼究能否繼承羅斯福而强力維持國內之戰爭體制，尙為疑義，即將召開之舊金山會議。失去羅為司會者，反軸心各國在心理上所受之影響，當可想像矣。最重要者，乃羅斯福·邱吉爾。斯達林三巨頭之結合，因羅斯福之死而告崩潰，當推行此次戰爭中，羅斯福·邱吉爾二人誠會身心一體，指導反軸心陣營作戰，是故羅斯福在三巨頭中所佔之勢力頗為重大，失云羅斯福後之邱吉爾，其地位業見搖動，其於今後反軸心軍之作戰方針上，影饗莫大。</p>
<h3>日大本營昨民表冲繩島方面戰果　續擊沉毀敵艦船廿一艘</h3>
<p>東京十三日中央社電　日大本營十三日下午四時發表，　冲繩本島南部陸上之戰况，其後無大變化，日軍部隊勇猛戰鬥，到處粉碎進攻之敵軍，敵登陸以來，截至四月十一日止，在陸上所獲之戰果中，業已判明之主要者如次：殺傷敵兵約六千三百名，燃燒戰車及鐵甲車百八十五輛，破壞載置汽車四十八輛，擊落及擊毀敵機七十九架。　日航空部隊及水上部隊，依然冒惡劣天氣，繼續攻擊冲繩本島附近之敵艦船及機動部隊，自四月十一日天氣凹復　後，對此敵軍部隊反覆加以航空攻擊，日方所獲戰果中，已經判明者如次：擊沉戰艦二艘，巡洋艦三艘，輸送船一艘，艦種不詳者二艘，擊破航空母艦三艘，巡洋艦四艘，驅逐艦三艘，輸送船一艘，魚雷艇二艘。</p>
<p>東京十三日中央社電　自美軍三月二十三日在冲繩島開始侵略作戰以來，截至本月十三日止，經日軍特攻隊，航空部隊以及水上部隊　加攻擊，獲得戰果頗大，其中已由大本營發表之日軍綜合戰果，計為擊沉敵艦船一百七十一艘，擊況或擊毀敵艦船九艘，擊毀敵艦船一百三十四艘，總計擊況或擊毀者已達三百十四艘，需時僅兩旬，即造成三百餘艘之記錄，日軍偉勛可謂空前。</p>
<p>南西羣島某基地十三日中央社電　日軍新銳特攻隊，十二日下午猛攻冲繩四周敵艦船集團，獲致戰果如次：轟沉戰艦二艘，巡洋艦一艘中魚雷，擊毀空母一艘，又受傷之空母速率顯見減低，成為日攻擊機目標。日方為掩護作戰，出動最新銳戰鬥機於南西羣島戰綫，在喜界島上空遭遇巨人型敵機約六十架，經交綏結果，擊落其二十三架，敵機即告遁去，此役日方損害，計自炸飛機一架，另一架被迫降陸。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>羅斯福逝世以後</h3>
<p>美國總統羅斯福，業於本月十一日以腦溢血症逝世，國內情形陷入混亂狀態，其前途趨向，殊堪注目。</p>
<p>羅斯福以一貴族子弟，自一九三二年十一月八日戰勝胡佛氏而當選為美國大總統以來，先後於一九三六、一九四〇、一九四四年，打破美國政治慣例而迭次被選為總統，實為世界罕見的現象。十二年以上的執政時期，從所調「新政」之實施一直到參加二次世界大戰，其間美國內外政局之演變，以及他的功罪，我們暫不論列，但以大東亞戰爭而論，他顯為直接捉成者。今日以東亞戰爭之戎首已死而即推論到美國政戰二略的全面轉變，當然尙非其時，因此，羅斯福之死，對於美國政戰大局之遭受極大打擊，以至影響到內外政策及作戰，則勢不可免。這是我們觀察羅斯福逝世後敵美動向的第一點。</p>
<p>羅斯福執政十二年餘，對於美國與世界的結果如何為一事，而他為近代國際政治上主要人物之一，則亦為世所公認。對內則漸成全國人民心目中之偶像而有四次連選的事實，今後美國欲覓一能在金融產業資本家代表者如羅斯福的人物，決非易事，抑且絕不可能。對外則折衝於英蘇對立國家陣營之間，經過德黑蘭及克里米亞兩度會議，使矛盾深刻之英美蘇三國暫能捐嫌而利好，今後要在他們三國間覓一善於詞令，以維持他們的聯繫者，實戞乎其難！因此，羅斯福逝世以後，美國內部混亂及英美蘇三國間對立之表面化及嚴重化，殆為勢所難免。這是我們觀察羅斯福逝世後敵美及敵方陣營動向的第二點。</p>
<p>羅斯幅在大東亞戰爭爆發以來，即為敵美陸海空軍最高統帥，在敵美戰略上，他為反攻日木本土最堅決之主張者，在反軸心陣營的世界戰略上，他又為太平洋反攻先於歐洲，至少與歐洲同時進攻戰略的堅持者；因為他這種堅決的主張，會引起英美蘇三國間及敵美重要將帥間的對立，現在羅斯福逝世，敵英及反軸心陣營的戰略，自不免受到重大的影響。這是我們觀察羅斯福逝世後敵美及敵方陣營動向的第三點。</p>
<p>繼羅斯福而代行總統及統師之權的，是現任副總統特魯曼，他在政治上雖為羅斯福政策的承繼者，但是他的資望畢竟太淺，在複雜而危急的美國，能否應付，實為一個疑問；至於軍事統帥方面，掌握目前規模巨大的戰局，恐方有未逮，所以今後敵美在戰略上，及統帥問題上，必不免於一度重大的混亂和紛爭。至於外交方面，特魯曼的地位也不是以繼羅斯福之後，然則別的不談，預定於四月二十五日舉行的舊金山會議，也許將完全喪失美國原來召集意義。</p>
<p>綜合上述，我們可以看到敵方已進人政治軍事外交的新難關。我們東亞民族惟有更進一步團結協力，把握機會，粉碎敵人攻略，以爭取最後勝利。</p>
<h3>陸空軍呼應作戰神風隊猛攻敵艦</h3>
<p>東京十三日中央社電　冲繩島附近自十一日天氣恢復以來，日陸軍航空隊緊密聯絡，反覆攻擊敵艦船及機動部隊，擴大戰果，陸上部隊亦與之呼應，於砲兵掩護之下，在各地粉碎敵軍企圖，現在南部地區津　西南方高地及大山南北地區名護村方面有激戰，中城灣，津田島日守軍，亦與敵軍交戰中。</p>
<p>南西羣島基地十三日中央社電　據十二日下午偵察冲繩四周敵機動部隊情勢如次：在本島東北一百公里之海面，有以正規空母六艘，特設空母二艘為主力之敵艦隊三隊，均向西南方駛航。又本島四周依然有戰艦七艘，巡洋艦十艘，驅逐艦十四艘，運輸船五十五艘，登陸用舟艇四十艘左右，不斷向日軍陸上陣地發砲轟擊</p>
<p>西南某地十三日中央社電　日航空隊十二日未明强襲冲繩島北部及中部飛機塲，旋即見有高約三千公尺之大黑烟由機塲附近昌起。又其他六所發生大火災。</p>
<p>某海軍基地十三日中央社電　神風特別攻擊隊〇〇隊，良十一日下午二時起，約歷一小時，猛烈攻擊包括大型空母二艘，特設空母一艘之敵機動部隊，日軍基地會光後接獲攻擊機發出一本機衡入敵空母」或「發見敵空母」之電報，預料此役戰果甚大。</p>

<h3>趙宣長談推進　電影事業　注意題材改善</h3>
<p>南京十三日中央社電　電影事業為推進文化敎育之工具，使命相當重大。趙宣傳部長有鑒於此，特於日前赴滬，將中華電影公司重加整頓，親任董事長一職，深信今後電影事業，在趙部長之督導下，必將嶄然一新。趙部長於返京後，曾就此發表談話如下：「電影負文化敎育之使命，自不待言，華影各片雖不能謂為盡臻美備，然如「萬世流芳」「敎師萬歲」「回頭是岸」等片，實不能不謂與文化敎育有關，一般影片雖不能盡如上列，其中亦不無可取之處，此後本人就任公司董事長後，自當予以注意。</p>

<h3>渝共黨代表　啟程赴美</h3>
<p>澳鬥十三日中央社電　海通社訊，美國消息：重慶參加舊金山會議乏共戰代表董必武，昨日啓程赴美，為重慶代表之最後啓程者。左翼「民主同盟」開會歡送董必武，於席問申稱，重慶倘不成立聯合政府，或將發生內戰</p>
<h3>司法副院長　朱履龢逝世</h3>
<p>南京十三日中央社電　司法院副院長朱履龢，於十一日亥時在京逝世，享年七十一歲。朱氏浙江嘉興人，一生盡瘁黨國，在司法界服務具有歷史，會任司法部代理部長等職，還都後任司法院副院長兼任中央公務員懲戒會委員長，噩耗傳出，各方深致惋惜。</p>
<h3>美對渝共的愚弄態度</h3>
<p>為居中調停渝共妥協交涉的「魯仲連」而負斡旋之責的美國駐渝大使哈萊，已於二月二十八日偕美駐渝司令維特米爾離渝返國。此後美國對渝能度將有重大變化，常可預料。對於以美國的壓力尙且不能使渝共妥協的複雜情形，哈萊將根據其苦痛經騐而向其本國獻計，而維特米爾也將據實報告渝共雨軍祇專心內戰而不努力抗戰。美國在渝外交，軍事雙方的最高負責者旣已齊聲要求依據新的對渝認識而改善美國對渝政策，美常局當然也不得不仔細考慮。</p>
<p>因此，美國新對渝態度將由何種具體形式表現，不論是重慶或延安，一定都很注意。美國將支持重慶抑將支持延安，由其態度如何，即可左右渝共兩者的命運。單就此點而論，渝共之以血眼探紫美國的眞意，亦可洞如觀火。滯留華盛頓的哈萊，二日接見記者團時，對於記者團方面所提關於共產黨要求美國供給武器一點的質問，曾答稱：「據我們的意見，供給某武裝政治團體以武器，無異美國承認新的交戰團體。但美國是承認渝政府而且支援的。」稅明美國政府祇支持重慶，不測將武器供給延安。此足表明美國的對渝新政策，所以具有極重要的意義。</p>
<p>去年來的美國對渝能度，幾乎始約是非難重慶，支持延安，甚至引南斯拉夫的米哈洛維基政權與蒂托政權為例，目重慶為中國的米哈洛維基政權，大肆攻擊。而對延安，則稱讚其民主政策，且不顧渝方的反對，派遣外籍記者圍視察共產地區，本年一月末並由美國紅十安會送去藥品，醫療器械等約十噸，美國之接近延安，頗有迅速進展之觀。而延安也迎合美國，為求其武器與軍需的援助，作種種媚態，提出在共產地區設置美軍用秘密飛行塲等交換條件，巧妙利用美國這種能度，强化對渝政治攻勢。</p>
<p>但美國這種接近延安的工作，全在刺戰重慶，使其更傾向美國，並由此合渝共兩軍在對日戰中多多犧牲，實際上祇是一種謀略而已。而哈萊歸國後突然翻臉不認延安，也不過想用「支持重慶」這一道符來逞其謀略罷了。對於美國這種突然冷淡的態度，延安當然大為驚愕，其機關報新華日報五日社評稱：「哈萊漢視中國民衆民主主義的要求，使以統一中國為目的的延安增加無限的困難。縱謂哈萊的聲明足使中國分裂，而包藏促起內亂的危機，亦非過言。」對於美國的這種冷酷，頗為怨嗟。總之，由以上的事實而觀，可知重慶與延安均受美國愚卉，至少美國之所謂「對華政策」是絲豪未曾顧及增進中國民衆的福利的。（譯自四月十三日大陸新報）</p>
<h3>日艦阿波丸　遭擊沉事件　井口情報部長談經過</h3>
<p>東京十三日中央社電　關於日艦阿波丸，遭美潛艇擊沉事件，情報局第三部長井口十三日會見外籍記時談其經地稱：關於阿波丸駛往南方，去年十二月十三日由駐東京瑞士公使館轉來美政府予以安全保障之通知，該通知文中美國方面稱，「美國及其聯合國對該船向南方裝運救濟呂，決不加攻擊或艦詢等種種妨礙，」然該船卒遭擎沉，諒有相常死亡，關於此事，迄今尙未接得美方任何通知。阿波丸運照日美兩國共同決定之航路駛行，三月三十日（即擊沉前三日），該船為改變一部份航路，曾由日政府確實通知美政府，預計該船於四月五日駛進敦賀港，但至四月一日磅晚起，連絡即告斷絕，日本政府對此頗表憂慮，但仍信仰美政府之安全保障，靜候消息。四月六日會見記者團時，本人曾述稱，該船自南方返國後，將從蘇聯裝運美國送出之救濟品，並轉由東京瑞士公使包將此意通知美政府，但美政府並無答覆，四月十一日即該船被擊沉經過十日後，本人接見外籍記者時，亦會提及該船之所在地點，並說明日本政府關於此事要求美國答復。然美政府迄十二日為止，猶未發表該船擊沉之事實，僅稱救護美方生存者一人，該人指被擊沉之船舶即係阿波丸。美國方面決不可謂不能識別阿波丸，阿波丸裝有燈火甚多，幷依照日美兩國裝有電燈標識，在附近海面當極易認淸。又該船被擊沉後，當有相當人數之生存者留於海面，日本政府昨日由瑞士公使館轉告美政府，報告經過情形，以及救護人數姓名·所在地點·健康狀况及處理情形等。</p>
<h3>琅勃剌王國　宣吿獨立　願與日本協力</h3>
<p>琅勃刺邦（印度支那）九日中央社電　琅勃刺邦王國八日舉行獨立宣言儀式，溫王發表宣言如次：「琅勃刺邦王國鑒於世界情勢之變化，特此宜言我王國脫離與法國間隸屬關係，完全恢復獨立，爾後王國維護獨立，並依照大東亞共同宣言之旨趣，貢獻於共同防衛，王國以全面信賴寄興日本帝國政府，以王國之全力協力日本。</p>

<h3>德境美軍疾進　渡越易北河　東西兩軍相距百七十里</h3>
<p>里斯本十三日中央社電　反軸心軍在西綫之總攻擊，日趨熾烈化，德方軍事當局亦稱，反軸心軍於德領南北全綫因進擊迅速，其隊伍之所在及先鋒之抵達地點，互相交錯。美第九軍十二日渡過易北河，德軍若無適當之對抗措置，則將陷於最危險狀態。易北河至柏林僅九十二公里，該河為防禦德國首都之最後障壁。美第九軍之第二機甲師團，十一日進至距馬格特保七十六公里之地區，其渡河地鉅尙未發表，唯僅聞確立基地之橋頭堡，刻下與東綫這蘇柯夫軍前後挾擊柏林，兩軍相距約百七十六公里，此後數日間之形勢，甚值注目。</p>
<p>柏林十三日中央社電　海通社訊：西線美軍天始大攻勢，在西法里亞工業區戰爭尤為嚴重，美軍向哈斯及不倫瑞克之兩側推進，美第九軍先鋒已進至馬格特堡南部，被毀坦克車一百餘輛。該地迤南美軍進至威瑪兩側，柯堡區戰事亦烈。於魯爾區被圍德軍牽制敵方步兵十三師·坦克車四師·空運軍二師·及大批英美戰門機，該區敵軍團攻埃森·安那·波冲。西線北段德軍在愛姆斯與威塞河間成立新防線，白萊門之南德軍反攻，履次却敵。陶格與雅斯特之間及在柯沙爾之北，敵進犯未逞。</p>
<p>企圖實現會師計劃　　柏林十三日中央社電　海通社訊：美第九軍坦克先鋒隊已抵易北河，反軸心軍殆將集中兵力，深入來比錫區域，實現與蘇軍在勞西茲會師之計劃。反軸心軍對勞西茲之威脅最為嚴生，反軸心軍已抵里許登斐爾斯班堡·紐倫堡之東北。</p>

<h3>羅斯福逝世　周市長感想</h3>
<p>關於美國大總統羅斯福逝世，本市周市長發表感想如次：</p>
<p>民心士氣難免頹喪</p>
<p>美國大總統羅斯福氏，巳於昨日逝世，羅斯福氏連任美國總統已達四届，實爲美國歷史上空前之紀錄。就吾人平時所知，美國民衆十之八九，已對羅斯福具有比較深切之信仰，雖認羅氏今次以如此重大代價從事戰爭，不無疑慮，然終未能減少其由信仰所生之布望。當茲歐陸及太平洋兩大戰塲戰局”趨苛烈之際，美國之元竹，忽然逝世，衝以美國民情易於激動，及夙昔對於羅氏十分信仰之關係，美國民心受此衡激，難免頹喪，尤其影響於戰塲士氣者，至深且大。乃至以美蘇爲中心之舊金山會議，於興高彩烈，準備開會旬日之前，忽　此巨變，使對於此項會議過抱樂觀之與會者，心理上忽呈階影，亦屬必然之事</p>
<p>東亞人民深切警戒　　惟美國向為所謂民主國家，久於其位之當局，中道逝去，固有極大影響，但未可進觀為國策即將有變更。吾人本於東亞十億人民，共求解放之大義，以及同盟參戰之初衷，不問其爲　境境，亦不問對方有何變化，惟有深切警戒，奮鬥不懈。向完遂戰爭之　邁進，固不可輕易榮觀，以自懈其鬥志也。</p>
<h3>松平部長談話</h3>
<p>日大使館上海事務所情報部松平部長，十三日關於美總統羅斯福之逝世，特發表談話如下：</p>
<p>特魯曼氏資望不足</p>
<p>羅斯福曾力政治外交手段，指導對外對內事務，今雖氏突以逝世聞，美國即失一重心，其國內及反軸心陣營所受影響者，至深且大。特魯曼竟以副總統資格，昇任總統矣，但特氏爲無名之士，且其經歷亦頗爲平凡，其政治手段更爲低劣，預料邱吉爾定必失望。特氏資　以不如羅斯福之故，其在外交政策上，對英美恐難立於指導地位。又對於其他南美洲諸國之外交上，亦難期待其有任何權咸發揮也。至於國內，則必將招致議會之磨擦與對立，向時政府與駐國外陸海軍魯部這關係，亦勢必九生不圖濟之狀態。</p>
<p>美軍政界均抱悲觀</p>
<p>美國某通訊記者批評特魯曼謂：彼係由黑暗中崛起之一平凡老人而已。因此，美國軍政界對於特氏均抱悲觀，是故將來影響於兵士作戰精神，亦必重大。以目前論，美國原有之各種計劃，雖一時或不能變更，甚或設置補佐機構，以協助特氏之無能，亦未可知。但吾等目睹獨裁國之遭逢如此悲劇，必須激勵志氣，爲新中國獨立，向擊滅驕敵之目的邁進。</p>
<h3>市財局限期　報繳營業稅　月底截止逾期加徵罰金</h3>
<p>市財政局對於三十四年市區春季營業稅，業於四月一日全面開始，各葉商號遵令報繳者，固甚踴躍，各區稽征處按日均將繳送稅款解入市庫，而猶豫觀望，藉詞延宕者，仍非少數。據悉該局爲厲行稅政，充裕庫收紀見，經限於四月底止，為春季營業稅報繳最後截止日期，所有應繳春季營業稅，統應遵章一律報繳，倘自誤限期，該局決照章加征滯納罰金，依照征收章程第十六條規定，逾限十日報繳該稅款者，加收滯納　金十分之一，十日以上加收十分之二，逾限一月者停止其營業，並押繳應納稅款及滯納罰金。另悉，該局營業稅科已於四月一俟調查完畢，即行造具淸冊，報局派員徨查，聞本市前訂營業稅征收章程已不適用，經修正後，呈財部核准到局，准立施行。又該局對製造商以資本額課稅等級，略有修改。</p>

<h3>我軍我民</h3>
<p>— 小泉信三</p>
<p>敵機的盲炸，早爲意中事。身爲國民的我們，應負起責任，担任一切防空工作，不問事情大小，皆使當局的施策易於奏效。我們應共同覺悟，唯此才可報仇雪恨。對於縱火者及其元凶的處罰，捨此一途外另無他法。</p>
<p>徹底集中戰力</p>
<p>軍民應如何作戰？關於戰略大事，固有待於統帥者，但有一點是我們這班門外漢也可知道的，即最要緊的是徹底集中戰力。兵書日：「無所不備則無所不薄。」如果處處防備，則必處處脆弱。這不是我們今日應該三思的金言嗎？我國的戰力決非有餘。欲以此並不有餘的戰力予敵致命的打擊，唯一的方針即在適宜果斷的徹底集中，這是不言而明的。但實行徹底集中時，我國民苟乏堅强不屈的勇氣，即無法實現。所謂集中，即專心集於一點而亳不他顧·若不顧及其他，則未被顧慮者當然可有很大的損失和彼害。如果國民怯弱而易動搖，則軍方亦不能無所顧慮了。使我陸海軍毫不遲疑的實行戰略上戰術上最佳的處置，必須有安如磐石的國民在其背後。這是我們今日應該覺悟而銘之於心的。</p>
<p>戰爭决無妥協</p>
<p>這次的戰爭，決不測有妥協的，折衷的結局，此事已裕之又說了。或勝，或亡，非此即彼。除此以外，再沒有別的路，而且在我們自身以外，亦無可恃之力。凡我同胞，無論如何不可懷抱鉛誤的希望。萬一失敗或屈服，我們自己以及我們的兒孫將永沉於苦痛和屈辱的深淵。此點徵諸敵國的與論，更可明瞭，此在今日已無懷疑的餘地了。想到這點，我們尙有何事不敢爲？尙有何事不能忍？我們應該做的只此一點。只唱高調，決非眞正的智慧，何况今日已非逞小聰明的時候，而是「決心第一，智術第二」，一致作戰的時候。由此必定會在我們前展開一條光明大道。</p>
<p>捨却如意的想像</p>
<p>敵人打算實行本土上陸作戰吧。做不做是她們的自由。我們祇要照我們所信的準備起來即可。</p>
<p>據敵方發表，上陸作戰中，每一士兵需要船舶十六噸。即登陸十萬人須一百六十萬噸，五十萬人須八百萬噸，百萬人須一千六百萬噸。</p>
<p>單是這些船舶，其中能有幾艘到達日本的海岸呢？太平洋是廣漢的，日本的海岸綫是綿長的。這個浩翰的海面，對於他們，決不是安全的海，這是他們也知道的。魚雷，永雷，砲彈，炸彈，均相當有效——由日本將士使用時是有效的，而使其有效的我方將士，則是嚴格訓練出來的——這也是他們理應明白的。不過，得免擊沉的船總是有的。滿綱而抵我海岸的運輸船，將吐出其海兵陸兵吧。那些敵方的海陸士兵將怎樣呢？我們決不能耽於便宜於如意的想像。我國的存亡，在此分岐。日本二千六百餘年的歷史的延續，全視邀擊敵兵的日本將士和國民的行爲如何。</p>
<p>日本國民的愛國心</p>
<p>約在二十年前，德國學者愛彌爾·雷埃狄拉亞應東京帝國大學之聘，來日主購經濟學，他在聘期屆滿歸國後，曾著了一本關於日木的書。其中有一節講到日本人的愛國心，我至今猶記得。他說：「敵兵或許會生履此國土地，但決不能够生離此國。」乃是日本人所確信的。</p>
<p>人於鏡中始知自已的容貌，國民亦然。國民也常常由映於他國人目中的本身姿態而方始明白自巴的本來面目。正如見鏡中之我而省於我心，國民亦常常在得悉別國人如何看自已時而我正我心。雷埃狄拉亞的書雖是薄薄一小册，對於我國同胞，却是一面反映我們自已的明鏡。（譯自三月二十三日讀賣報知）</p>
<p>戰紀</p>
<h3>神潮特攻隊</h3>
<p>其一　菊水隊戰紀</p>
<p>去年十一月十二日，日本肉彈特殊滑航艇神潮特別攻擊隊菊水隊五勇士，突然進攻烏羅希環礁，展開敢死攻擊，一舉轟沉制式航空母艦二艘·戰艦三艘。這種偉勳，對於敵艦隊不帝睛天霹靂，予以莫大打擊。這就是久經訓練的日本特殊潛航艇必死必沉的肉彈攻擊，在高呼萬歲而命中轟沉敵艦的靑年熱血如沸之下，展開了日本勝利的大道。</p>
<p>以下是潛水艇長所確認的神潮特別攻擊隊菊水隊戰記：</p>
<p>時在夢中哥見的敵方航空母艦，現正在烏羅希等待我勇士的奇製·在括着季節風的波浪滔天的太平洋上，我們一路駛向敵方要　烏羅希環礁，敵大型機的哨戒也日嚴一日。</p>
<p>距我本土一千四百五十哩的烏羅希，爲敵方台灣洋面航空戰，菲島洋面海戰以至呂宋島東方洋上蠢動中的艦船的前進修理基地，亦爲敵艦隊的大根據地，有敵主力部隊的運輸船團等百餘艘碇泊在環礁內。十一月十九日上午十一時，烏羅希已遙遙在望，可以跳見縷縷黑烟。正午時，烏羅希椰林繁茂的環礁已很淸晰的映入眼簾。烏陰，有航空母艦或戰艦及其他艦等碇迫着，其中華盛頓級戰艦一艘傾斜殊甚，另外一艘亦受創很重，大砲砲口朝天，樣子十分可憐。艦長望着這些戰艦，眼裏簡直冒出火來，恨不得一下子將它們統統轟沉，但因時機未到，祗好默禱勇士們成功。</p>
<p>黃昏時，如得天佑，烏羅希附近海面平靜如油，而敵方又夢想不到我們會突然光顧，所以碇泊着的艦船都燈火輝煌，信號燈的燈光時在艦橋上忽明忽滅，連夜趁修的電焊的白熱光，由雲頭上反射到海上。好一個不夜之城！同時，强烈的探照燈更在海上天空不住掃射。</p>
<p>臨死瞬間不忘祖國</p>
<p>二十日夜三時，第一次突擊的時機已近。潛水艇長此時不禁想起今西少尉—那個豪爽的以一覩敵艦爲快的好男兒。同時，又想起了那個高呼「帝國海軍萬歲！大元帥陛下萬歲！」的福田中尉。直到死的瞬刻猶以祖國繁榮爲念，莞爾赴義，這是多麼崇高的精神啊！肉彈特殊潛航艇勇士就是抱着這種精神出發的，餘下的就祗有連人帶艇都變成彈丸，直向敵艦衝去，將其轟沉。</p>
<p>夜四時十六分，那方傳來了轟天震地價的一聲巨響，同時湧起了一股火柱，紅光燭天，黑烟濛濛。奇襲是成功了！這是仁科中尉艇撞中制式航空母艦時一瞬間的情景。</p>
<p>緊握着潛望鏡的艦長，不禁連連流下悲喜的眼淚。接着，福田中尉艇命中了華盛頓級戰艦，今西少尉艇撞沉了制式航空母艦。佐藤和渡邊兩少尉也相繼轟沉了戰艦。烏羅希環礁內頓時化爲阿鼻叫喚地獄。</p>
<p>碇泊燈這時突然一齊熄滅，祗剩下了熊熊的大火柱，映紅了天邊的雲。（手報道班員）（譯自三月二十六日朝日新聞）</p>
<p>其二　金剛隊戰記</p>
<p>「湊川清兮映旗光，武勳赫赫兮萬世流芳，美哉菊水隊，先我　敵陣！」這是肉彈特殊潛航艇第二陣金剛隊勇士遺下的悲歌。這批慷慨悲歌的勇士，已在一月十二日衝入敵陣，與敵偕亡了。繼菊水隊之後，金剛隊的勇士亦抱壯士不復返的決心，再度往襲島羅希環礁。帛琉本島可索爾水道，並襲大宮島的阿勃拉港，更長驅直搗新幾內亞的何朗第亞，對敵力五大艦隊根據地實行水中特別攻擊。自從菊水隊勇士突擊以後，敵方的營戒極其嚴重，簡直密不通風，然而金剛勇士却突破其警戒綫，擊沉了碇泊中的敵艦船，完成了現代的奇跡。當敵港警笛狂鳴，倉皇不知所措的進修，這些忠勇為國的勇士門，諒必莞爾昇天，與敵偕亡吧。以下便是神潮特別攻擊隊金兩隊的戰紀。</p>
<p>在鳥羅希奇襲成功</p>
<p>都所中尉舉手向北致敬，對祖國作最後的訣別。這時，同往參加烏羅希奇襲的加賀谷中尉。本井少尉及福本上會三勇士，都直立不動，神情十分嚴肅。其後，經過了不知幾日，在菊水隊完成任務以後二個月，神潮特攻隊又光臨鳥羅希環礁了。一月十二日，在敵軍巡邏艇的深水炸彈聲中，加賀谷大尉於五時五十七分聽到了大炸裂聲，知道寄襲已經成功。爲了確認金剛隊所獲的戰果起見，潛艇大胆接近鳥羅希，在潛望鏡中窺見的敵影，計為戰艦三艘，驅逐艦八艘，運輸船五十艘以上，但無航空母艦，未免遺憾。</p>
<p>偵察戰果的日潛艇，當然煞費苦心，但在十一晨猶不免受到敵方巡　艇的數民深炸彈攻擊。艦長的苦心，的確難以言喻，萬一事前被敵方發覺，金剛隊勇士的突擊亦將不可能了。到了晚上〇時，潛艇偷偷浮起一望，只見北方島羅希的燈火明滅閃爍，並且發見近處有島，正有點着三四盞燈的入港艦船在移動。這時，島上突有敵機飛出，靜浮水面的潛艇為了避免為其發覺，迅速潛入水中。</p>
<p>當金剛隊勇士等突人的時候，起初聽到巡邏艇奔駛的聲音，並遠遠聽到深水炸彈攻擊的聲音。其數在二十發以上。在這些聲音中，夾雜着巨大的爆炸聲，想必是勇士的攻擊成功了。未幾，烏羅希島發出了空襲警報。</p>
<p>汕豆腐酢飯團，是突擊時果腹的「辨當」。久住中尉，伊東少尉及有森上曹三勇士，一點都不興奮，淡淡然像平日的訓練一樣，帶着所需物品而一出擊了。可索爾水道中碇泊着許多大型運輸船，因此繼菊水隊之後，再有此次的突擊。有森上曹的成功，是五時二十分，伊東少尉則稍遲了五分鐘，是五時廿五分。在轟然的巨大爆炸聲裏，敢死的壯士獻出了寶貴的生命給其　國，負着確認勇士所建戰勳的潛水艇，在水底聽到沉重的反響。道一定是大型運輸船被轟沈了。</p>
<p>向大宮島敢死突擊　　「喂，不要太快了衡過頭哪！」工藤中尉對石川中尉，森二飛曹及三枝二飛曹說，他怕隨後來的同僚衝過了目標，所以預先叫他們留蔥。巧得很，森二曹和三枝二曹兩人都是航空預科練心班出身，而轉到海軍來的，他們的敎官曾對他們說：一不一家要駕飛機的，照樣也可做必死必中的特攻隊。」這兩位勇士因此從天空的「神風」一變而成水中的「神潮」。</p>
<p>出擊的艇上，傳出了一片勇士高呼萬歲的雄壯喊聲，打動了每個人的心弦。勇士們將菓子罐頭和氷帶入艇中，預備在途中大嚼一頓，都像孩子一般非常快樂。</p>
<p>跟去關查戰果的潛水艇，在十一日的霧靄中發見了大宮島。天空飛着敵機，水上駛着商船。預定的突擊時間快到。大宮島上，燈火熄熄，敢死突擊的勇士們大約正向着燈光朝阿勃拉港猛進吧。潛水艇長本來打算浮起察　他們的戰果，祇因敵機一直在空中盤旋，祗好作罷。到了十二日晨五時三十四分，將潛望鏡露出水面一望，祗見濃雲密佈，看不出島在何處，不過在阿勃拉方而，黑烟冲天，餘燼未燃，足證勇士們的突擊是成功了。</p>
<p>何朗第亞命中敵艦</p>
<p>當時，在何朗芬鮑爾特灣內碇泊着力有的運輸船團，料想一定還有航空母艦和戰艦在那裏。川文保中尉，原中尉，村松上　，佐藤一曹等勇士在出發時，曾李到「小敵不侮，大敵不懼」的命令，一心爲國，準備和敵艦同沉海底。</p>
<p>長驅遠征距離祖國甚遠的新幾內亞的勇士們，途中的航行非常平安。同去的潛水艇，在一月十日，即攻擊前二天，亦於日沒後發見敵方的巡　機，突入了何朗第亞的嚴重警戒綫內。</p>
<p>翌日，即十一日的黎中出現敵方巡邏艇四艘，它們都燃點着燈，爲其友方識別。金剛隊勇十的突擊，前途實在難以樂觀。近午時，在潛望鏡中又望見上陸用運輸船一艘，巡羅艇兩隻。到了黃昏時分，又窺見巡邏艇一隻，夜半更有一艘魚雷艇通過。到了十二日正午以後，各勇士料想已經突入灣內。一想到敵方巡邏船隻如此衆多，潛永艇長以下各員，都虔心祈禱勇士們成功。過了些時候，夜色又臨海上，突然望見遠遠駛來一艘點燈的大船。潛水艇長爲了呼應金剛隊勇士起見，也決意實行突擊，下令準備發射魚雷。可是，等到那艘船駛近，仔細一望，原來是一艘兩個烟囪的大型病院船，閃閃地可以看淸它的四個紅十字，所以祗好作罷。不過，由此有一點可以確定，就是旣有病院船駛進港內，那末一定還有大型艦停泊着。在黑暗中默默等到淸晨四時五十五分，望見何朗第亞方面湧起了一大片火燄。　剛隊的命中是確實了。末幾，海上突起大風雨，火燄　亦消失於其中。</p>
<p>是晚，潛水艇上的人員整列於艦上，朝何朗第亞方面向業巳成仁的各勇士靜默致敬，然後合唱「轟沉」第三節，歡呼萬歲，慶祝金剛隊肉彈突擊的成功。（平手報道班員）（譯自三月二十五日朝日新聞）</p>
<h3>冲繩島形勢圖</h3>
<p>冲繩本島之決戰，刻正在那　，首里，嘉敷，津堅島，中城，名護　及慶良間羣島之阿嘉島，座間味，渡嘉敷，前島，黑島等地進行中。日軍堅守陣地，對來襲敵人予以重大打擊。據日本大本營襲擊，自三月二十三日以來，日軍已擊沉及擊破敵方艦船計達四百十五艘之多，敵據動部隊陷於混亂狀態。日軍所獲戰果，對於今後作戰之勝利，意義殊為重大。</p>
<h3>保衛防空壕</h3>
<p>— 守一</p>
<p>近來郊外再度遭受空襲，致市區內之開掘防空壕工作，頓形緊張，爲減免生命之無調犧牲，開掘防空壕實爲當務之急，以本市人口之多，必也五步一溝十步一壕，始足敷全市居民之急用。但吾人試一躑躅街頭，考察已成之防空壕，則勢將黯然神傷，懷疑於空襲時之防空壕，是否有其眞價値？能否足為市民生命寄託之安全所？雖防空壕非絕對的安全，吾市民願於空襲時避身防空壕中否？蓋現有之防空壕，於工作吿成之後，鮮有對之再稍加注意或保護者，致使若千防空壕形成下列狀態：</p>
<p>爲頑童嬉戲之塲地，彼輩上下奔波，拋磚擲泥，以致壕內泥石狼籍，壕身圯毀。</p>
<p>爲乞丐掩身起居處所，彼輩合於斯，居於斯，致使壕內破布殘蓆，交錯縱橫，更與市民共視之爲公坑所，以致是氣橫溢，令人掩鼻。</p>
<p>天雨後，地勢低下之防本驟，滿積汚水，微風起處，濁波蕩漾，使人與只認水池不認壕之概。</p>
<p>有此數種情狀，一旦空襲來臨，試問市民如何站足藏身其間，或以爲避難顧不得衛生，然須知不衛生，決非爲防空壕內應有之現象也，再天氣漸熱，汚物濁水，不爲掃除，蚊蠅孵育，則傳染病定將方興未艾矣，多一防空壕，勢必多一疾病媒介所，所以保民者，反爲害民，能不令人寒心。茲就管見所及，擬定保衛防空壕辦法二條，　市政衛生及保甲常局垂察焉。</p>
<p>防空壕之圯毀或不潔者，應由開掘者重加修理，壩內汚物泥石垃圾等當由清道夫役掃除，濁水則由有關係保甲人員利用原有滅火水桶汲淸之，隨後敷置石灰黃沙，令使速乾，必要時衛生局協助消毒。</p>
<p>防空　之完整者，照由　　自　　員負責時加留意，弗令任何人入內作有損防空壕之舉動，並於壕外樹立或張貼怖吿，嚴禁無故擅入。此外　察更須隨時巡視，遧者拘局處罰。</p>
<p>上述二條辦法，專之無甚高論，輕而易舉，有關當局固優爲之。一旦防空壕非爲應時點綴品，而實爲名符其實之防空壕，則市民幸甚矣。</p>
<h3>再論改良掘井</h3>
<p>— 鮑祚祈</p>
<p>第八期上海市政戲有「改良掘井德義」，提議「將井圈除去，以水泥舖成平面，共開孔大小，以便於汲水桶上下及孩童不能跌下爲度，另裝石蓋。如經濟許可，並裝打水琊浦。」筆者提供意見如下，藉供研究。</p>
<p>將井圈除去，其危險性較大，如忘放石　，則稍大之類，更易跌下。</p>
<p>開孔大小，欲適合便於汲水桶大小並使孩童不能跌下之條件，恐不可能，蓋汲水桶之口圍並未較孩童之腰闈爲小，况汲水時，井口太小，亦感不使。</p>
<p>裝設打水帮浦，價極格大，恐非一般人所能負担，且帮浦極易損壞，頗多麻煩，與經濟原則亦不合。</p>
<p>若在井之四週，裝一約五六尺高之木柵，（近鄰泰興路四維邨之公井，即應用此法。）兒童旣無洗衣洗菜之必要，絕對禁止其入內，可避免兒童嬉戲跌入或黑夜行人失足之危險。</p>
<p>至於井之易於破壞，建造堅牢固屬至要，而居民之愛護公物，尤屬必須。</p>
<h3>滬甬帆船交通</h3>
<p>— 劉豐</p>
<p>上海往浙東寗波，由於輪船開行不定期，購票亦困難，帆船公司乃應運而生。這些公司從前大多從事於上海寗波間的貨運工作，有時也搭客，但多數是熟人，並不計較船費。近來爲適合需要，已公開賣票搭客。茲就調查所得，分述如下：</p>
<p>滬　帆船公司——設十六舖新街十五號，備有帆船四艘，專駛上海至鎭海之蟹浦。其所行航綫，與大輪所經者略同，唯較近海岸而已。出發處爲楊樹浦廣新碼頭，由碼頭下小駁船再上帆船，每人駁費五百元。大帆船泊於二十六號或二十七號浮筒，旅客下船後起帆，順退潮至吳淞。至水警隊流動檢查，海關檢查及戒嚴船檢查，在吳淞等候有東北風，西北風或北風，就可直放蟹浦。最順風時約十六小時至二十小時即可到達。其所取路綫爲：吳淞出口越三格水，崇明島邊岸，渦裏鋼沙，外鋼沙，亮山至鎭海口　蟹浦。蟹浦爲離鎭海東北十五里的小鎭，是漁民的集人龜，也有旅社　舖，當地有保安大隊，旅客上岸須受檢查。此綫船票第人一萬二千元，未滿十歲者半票，乘客須先行登記，行李五十公斤以卜每　收水脚一千五百元，當購票時隨購行李票，以便搬運上船，船中不供飯食，可自帶乾糧，或帶米由老大代燒，下船時付船老大茶水費二三百元，欲赴寗波者可四十里，每天有兩班，開駛時間爲上午八時半及下午一時，票價四百元。如要舒適，亦有專船可乘，直達寗波江北岸。如走陸路，可由蟹浦經鎭海，再往寗波，全程約五十里，現時無汽車可乘。</p>
<p>民生帆船航運公司——售票處有三處，一爲天潼路六八五號，一爲金神父路六六號，一爲南市裏倉橋街萬興酒坊。船泊於南市關橋碼頭，乘浦江退潮北駛至吳淞，候風出口，不順風則不開，經外銅沙，大小梁山，五星藏至鎭海龍山至。此綫票價一萬三千元。在龍山早到可不住遲到則須住一夜，再由龍山起早經外門　至河頭市，約行入里，由河頭市乘快船，經四小時水途四十五里即抵寗波。全綫需費一萬五千元，小件行李免費携帶，大件另加永脚二千元。現在每隔日一班，如人多可每日開長，乘客須預先購票。至於開船時間，則由公司派專人臨時通知。食糧須目備，或帶米由老大帶燒，下船時酌付酒　。在寗波附近有鄭縣保安隊及水警察及警察等檢查，需付每人五百至一千元的費用以省麻煩。</p>
<p>益民帆船行——設東新橋集群廣里二十二號，船泊楊樹浦廣新碼頭，駛至鎭海為止，由鎭海再改乘快船往　被，預先購票，票價一萬五千元，十歲以下半票。行李限帶七公斤，越　每公斤收二百元，大件行李每件取費五千，途中伙食自備。由廣新碼頭解電時間，隨退潮時間而定。順風二十小時可達鎭海，下船須給船老大茶資千元以內。</p>
<p>建榮貿易運輸行——設永壽街，即前東自來火街六十五號A　（大上海路口）。其路線為由上第該公司門首晨八時乘團體客車（可容四五十人（經虹橋·北橋·　橋至閔行，因該處南黃浦之輸渡無小汽輪，無法渡過，汽車遂至此為止。全程計五十里，約需時三小時。由閔行乘快船至張家軍·約六十里，需五六上時，當晚即下海船，乘順風渡錢塘江　，直駛臨山衛（屬餘姚），此線海程一百二十浬，抵此則由乘客自動前往各地，臨山衛至餘姚縣城約六十里，餘姚至寗波約八十里，有小汽輪可通。該公司現有團體客車兩部，民船士隻，唯閔行至張家惲一段，本可仍用汽車戰客，現用快船。每月逢五逢十開車，旅客須先購票，全程票價包括汽車快船海船，共二萬五千元需時兩天。</p>
<p>大連航運公司——高南市小北門萬竹街一〇一號，有民船四五艘，大者可載客百人左右，小者四五十人，事駛庵東·餘姚·上虞·倪家路一帶。採相同航線者尙有數家。</p>
<h3>設置公典管見</h3>
<p>— 仁者</p>
<p>報載本市市政府為嘉慮平民起見，設置公典，公布規程，由社會福利局主辦，規定月利五分，限期六個月，每次以五千元為度云云，不禁為全市　水階級慶幸。綠現時薪水階級收入，不够十日開支，此為衆所週知之事實。其挖肉補遮，不得不受高利貸之重生剝削。在前，本市大同行當典，每月取息一角，存箱一次加一角五分，限期四月，月不過五。迨至小同行提高月息二角，存箱一角八分，一個月期滿，等於三角五分之利息，大同行遂止當候廣，相率停業。至此，市民生計日絀。</p>
<p>據閔本市大同行典業僅十七家（？），小同行典業有七百餘家之多（？）。吾人希望市政當局，就原有之大同行設備及人力，改設公典，以資應輕就熟，易於實現。惟每家僅依此二千萬元資本，恐難圓滑。最好商請儲備銀行，援貸放生產事業大借款例，按月貸放鉅款，利息一分。其性質雖爲消極的救濟平民，而其中生產事業及其與生產事業有關之工商從業員——薪水階級，獲得生活上之救助，而能安心工作，仍不失爲積極的協助生產也。</p>
<h3>整潔自警亭</h3>
<p>— 張孟昭</p>
<p>本市保甲制度之完善，保甲組織之嚴密，經過相當的時期和上下通力合作的努力，已一天天的在增强，在進步，而自警亭之高，原為自警團員避風雨和深夜值崗時，棲避之所。乃近來如寗夏路等自警亭，深夜常有馬路掃三或乞丐等盤踞在內，自警團員揮之不云，力弱教師晚或反為所辱，如此　巢鳩佔，小　跳梁，殊屬不成事體，旣玷市容，復　保印令警，應請保甲當局注意嚴　自警團員會同檢察，予以驅逐或拘究。　後對於全市自警亭，應要置一門，並裝配門鎖，何人値岡，何人負責，如　交警棍及袖章然，戴淸宵小，革新自警亭，誠急不容綏之舉，務希保甲當局汪意及之。</p>

<h3>歸路</h3>
<p>— 川我</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>我幾乎不認得這位幼時的同伴了。他雖長得委長大，可地顯着十分憔悴，那雙隱藏在濃眉下的黑眼已失云了幾年前的活潑的光輝，而嘴角却掛上一片世故的笑容。</p>
<p>我緊握着他的手，呵，他的手是那末粗大！但當擺動時，我無意間發現他那隻臂膊有點不自然。</p>
<p>「是的，給彈片打傷的啊！』當我問他後·他這棵憂傷地回答了。接着便把這故事告訴了我們。</p>
<p>「五年前的春天，鄉下是很不太平的。我在房子被燒了後，帶着一個老祖母住在李家破祠堂裏。有一晚，外面發生了劇烈的槍聲，漸向這破祠堂移近，我和祖母嚇得伏在地上，但是立刻有一部份人衝了進來，接着槍彈飛進窗裏，我只覺得臂上一陣劇痛，便失了知覺地昏過去了。後來還是祖母向人家泣吿，才算田村裏幾個人的琊助勉强醫好了牠，可是終於成了一個拐手。我不能再帮人家種田了，只好每天到野塞鎭去販點大餅油條來賣，這那裏能好好地養活祖母呢？…直到去年開春，由於一個表叔的介紹，我才到上海一家機器廠出來做學徒。……</p>
<p>我還不知道他到上海已經一年多了。上海，被說是一個容易發展的地方，這一個幼年喪了父母和長兄，又　到槍傷的不幸的苦兒也許能此後獲得一點安全的命運吧？工廠學徒，生活當然是艱苦的，可是，老天給了他這一個長大的身子和不屈的性格，我能不相信他會在艱苦中鍛連得堅强起來麼？</p>
<p>我們慣常地問起他祖母的好來，而他的臉色突變爲灰　了。他用哭音對我們說：「祖母已經病死了，我馬上就要回去。但是……」</p>
<p>我心裹覺得被一種凝固了的悲哀沉壓着。說到死，這一個七十開外的老人也不算早了，可是，換消地渡過了中年，眼看着兒子孫子活生生地死去，結果只戰戰兢兢地抱緊了這一個幼孫，用乞　於人來過活；而在照耀她底　冷的生活的角落的那一點微光也幾乎在慘酷的槍彈下熄滅的時候，多少天她是用眼淚沈血啊！到土海來，她流着痛苦超過了高與的凄凉的老淚，是的，她還能用什麼來保證能和她的孫兇再會見呢？有着這種處境的老人往往愛她底子孫勝於愛她自己，她是願意多挨命幾天看見她孫兒的成功的啊！</p>
<p>我更不忍爲生者設想悲哀。然而他底「但是」下面要說的是什麼呢？我關心着他底生活的將來，我不能不問他。</p>
<p>「這次我一回去，我使不能再到廠裏來了。」這聲音比說他的祖母的死的還要痛苦。</p>
<p>「早一個多月前，我得到了祖母生病的消息，我向老板請假回去，起先是堅決不肯，他說：「這幾天正是工忙的時候，你是不是有意拆我的伙？」後來再三懇求，並說請假期內工錢照扣，他才答應我回去一個星期。那一次回去倒好，祖母並沒有死。我又連忙避回來。可是，現在　母究竟死了，我怎能不再回去呢？這次去對老板說，他的口氣可不同了：「你去了不到一個月又要再去，大槪是存心不在這裹做了。現在我對你只有二句話：要回去，就不必再來；要想還在這裹做，可休要說回去！」我說：「我的祖母死，可沒有辦法呀。」「現在我只和你談實在的事情，你祖母的死不死可與我不相千！」我立刻堅持了我的走，他便把工錢算給了我，可是除下車資恐怕就不剩什麼了……」</p>
<p>罪惡的飯碗被打破了，可是捨去這一個罪悲的？對於一個毫沒有投靠的身有殘疾的年靑人這大的世界又是何等的狹小呵！找記得：故鄕的山水是明媚的，故鄕的土地是廣大的；游土裏含蘊着生命的寶藏，山嶺上吹拂着豐長的野草，故鄕的原野滋育着千萬個兒女，可是，也凍餒了另外的一羣。田地被少數人佔有了，稻麥柴草堆進了富有者的房倉；更有的是：多少山野已夷爲荒地，多少村莊已毀爲廢墟，沒有田地的人能從他底故鄕得到什麼呢？更何况是老實的身體不完全他！</p>
<p>「這種老板眞是太不講道理了，這次失業是不能怪你的，好好地到鄉下用力做去，年靑人養活自己一個總是容易的事吧？」父親這樣安慰着他。</p>
<p>「是的，我也是這末想，不過想到自己連一塊地一間屋也沒有的時候，我心裏眞有點胆寒呢！」</p>
<p>他終於默默且徬徨地去了。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>初秋的晚風把我送回了故鄉。</p>
<p>低徊於久別的鄉懷有，我格外懷念起英來。</p>
<p>在一個露寒的早晨，我遇見了他。</p>
<p>我幾乎不認得這位別有五月的朋友了！他穿着　　的衣袴，短蓋袴上破了個很大的洞，難堪地露出他的大腿來。他的赤脚紅黑而破裂，和他那削瘦而焦黃的面孔說明了他身體所遭受的生活的虐待。那雙眼睛裏積下了新陳的悲憤愁苦，憂鬱的灰塵染上了漆黑的眼珠；當然，嘴角上的那片世故的笑容也被無淚的悲哀所代替了。</p>
<p>他變得比從前更不善說話，也許，騙人的說話對於他原是不需要的：向强者去乞憐，他不會；向弱者去威哧，他不能；而向親戚去求援，又是他不願的啊！</p>
<p>假使我是他的一個有錢的同鄉，他一定不來見我了。因為我是他的窮朋友，而且他懂得我的性格，所以他毫不慚愧地用熱情的調子和拙笨的語方對我訴說了四五個月來的遭遇。</p>
<p>他開始舉起鐮刀和扁担來生活了，但是他自已沒有山地，他只能尋我沒有主人的野地去割柴草，而他的右手是不會用鐮刀的。不過山地並沒有明確的界綫，勢力大的人可以强據野地爲巴有，這樣他便不得不在夜裏跑到很遠的深山裏去。不幸有一次他被張順爺的帮傭看見了，結果在他迎着淸晨的微光吃力地挑着柴向城裹去賣的時候，他被一羣人所包圍，他們說他偸柴，把他拘到張順爺的家裏，除一担柴沒收外，還吃了一頓打。自從這次以後，人家都曉得他是一個毫無產業的窮光蛋了，便格外的防範他，於是他便有好幾次被提。在從未嘗到的非人的磨折下，他終於病倒下來了。他呻吟在破　堂裹，誰也不來照顧他，從來他的姐姐知道了，偸着空來看他，給了他幾升米，但立刻就被婆婆查出來，痛罵了她一通。在秋收的時候，他撐着病要替人家做短工，可是人家都不要他，因爲他右手不便，不能打稻，揚稻，海米等，但總算王根發家人手然，便呌他在農忙的幾天替他們放放牛，挑挑水，給他吃碗飯。</p>
<p>眼看現在又是新稻收盡的時候了，英又將失去他底「臨時飯碗」，前路迷茫，該知道怎末走法呢。……</p>
<p>「我懊悔我那一次回絕了老板？……」他這樣結東了他的訴吿，無力地低下頭來。</p>
<p>「到眞正沒有辦法的時候，我是要離開家鄕　。死便死吧，我再沒有什麼顧應了。」這是他和我分乎時的感慨的話語，它洛在我心底是沉重的，</p>
<p>是的，被罪惡的人們所遺棄了的人也許能幹出點人類的眞正的事榮來。我祝福他不久會走上新的道路。而我相信：他的步子將是永遠堅定，他的眼睛將是永遠向前的！</p>
<h3>烟蒂火</h3>
<p>— 夏如</p>
<p>夜之雨巷，有火星光亮，</p>
<p>明滅閃爍，掙扎於泥沼，裊動靑烟一尾，生命在掙扎。</p>
<p>濘烟，嗘躍之鞋印糢糊，</p>
<p>夜行人的脚，已遠，</p>
<p>曾有深夜的寂寞，留下。</p>
<p>也許正咀嚼夢的破滅，</p>
<p>更有暮色的心涯。夜之雨巷，我</p>
<p>顫抖於思索，無懼怕，有一樓</p>
<p>殘餘的烟蒂火。</p>
<h3>小雲彩</h3>
<p>— 商朱</p>
<p>一昨晚上，當夜色深靜的時候，突然一股悲哀的思想襲住我，沒有來由的，也似有許多來由的。我竟想到要毀滅自己。」司馬如對他的朋友說，在一個天氣好得不會繁殖悲哀的種子的日子裘。</p>
<p>我感到孤獨了，於是我就停住工作思索起來。世界離得我很遠。我要的不是形式的人而是有情感的人的同情。以前我喜愛寂寞，可是昨夜我對寂寞生了恐懼。我悲哀了一夜；今天我尙帶有餘哀。」</p>
<p>司馬如抬頭望天，週視洛在和煦陽光中的自已和四圍景物。太陽透着春天的笑意，司馬如有春天的悲哀。等等沒有回覆的聲音，他看看他朋友的茫然的臉，心裏在怪她的天眞，不懂思想的生活。</p>
<p>「我不知怎麼會勾起這種念頭的。」他繼續說，好似在獨語。「它如急病襲來一般奇突。我年靑靑的竟會滿足自己短短的生涯。想到殺死自巴。」</p>
<p>「大槪遇到不如意的事了。或是愛情委棄了你。」他的朋友說。</p>
<p>「愛情在庸俗人們心中才是唯一的東西。」</p>
<p>「那末，寂寞於友情？」</p>
<p>「對了，也許我是悲哀友情的缺乏。」</p>
<p>「或是友情的失去？」</p>
<p>「友情是不會失落的：我早就有它的缺乏，可是一直滿足，沒有發現。一旦發現，便如失去一樣的空虛了。空虛的感覺是孤獨的來源。』</p>
<p>司馬如說着深深喂嘆。他遠遠望去，這空曠的地，遼遠遼遠沒有人影，空曠的天，遼遠遼遠沒有象彩。但這不是一個朗爽的滿足的感覺，在他的心中佔滿空洞。</p>
<p>「你很可以哭一番。」他的朋友說。</p>
<p>「我是想哭的，可是我怎麼會哭呢？我，我，我想到我自已，淚就不出來了。我很傷心，可是孤獨的人讓他自己知道他的孤獨。自滿的人不會感覺孤寂的。」</p>
<p>「你侮辱了你的朋友。」</p>
<p>「爲什麼？」司馬如問。</p>
<p>「你當着朋友的面說你缺乏友情，你不害羞？」</p>
<p>「我憎恨的是自己。我的心裏一直不會熱鬧，現在我好像需要熱鬧。」</p>
<p>「司馬如，你說話太迂迴！」他的朋友喊。</p>
<p>司馬如作了一個苦笑，彷彿是無可奈何的回答，彷彿代表了點頭的動作。他許着一枝尙未豐滿長育的樹幹看無雲的天空；往常他喜愛觀望雲彩的變幻，對芾它們，他作種種浩無邊際的臆測，有時讓一朶飄逝的雲；載着他一身靈魂的重負，他的思想，他的緬懷往遠飛去。這是一種有趣的取樂，司馬如現在盼望遠方有一朶白色的東西升起，載走他滿腔悲哀。</p>
<p>「你想什麼？」他的朋友在奉天的美色下，焦躁地，快樂地問。</p>
<p>司馬如應聲從無雲的天空落下來，他搜索看憑靠。在他的朋友的豐腴的笑臉上，她的靑春的生氣上，司馬如發現了那朶白色的輕浮的雲。</p>
<p>小雲彩載走司馬如的悲哀。</p>
<p>「爲什麼不讓我們享受春天呢！」司馬如拖住他的朋友的手，跳跳蹤蹤的直朝空曠的廣野跑去；那遠方，那春天的遠方，那遠方的春天！　—春之章—</p>
<h3>夫妻</h3>
<p>— 袁鷹</p>
<p>如果你高興，並且，在重重的生活的煎煞下還能有一些空閑，可否請你坐下來，待一會兒，讓我爲你說完這一支平凡的故事？</p>
<p>故事的主角是一對大學生，我底朋友。男的戴過方帽子，——到現在他們房間裏還掛着一張照相，畢業時候拍的。——女的唸過兩年西洋文學系，背過一點莎士比亞。</p>
<p>他們倆在去年結了婚。</p>
<p>老熙，那個戴方帽子的傢伙，靠了一個親戚，幸運地，從一大羣對着文憑嘆氣的伙伴中，抓住一隻保險公司小職員的飯碗，儘管當初唸的是敎育系，知道的只是動機，智力商數，和Normal　Curve之類，跑進保險公司似乎有點不大調和，可是人們對於他也還是羨慕的，就如老D，他就表示過：</p>
<p>「老熙眞有苗頭，一出學校門就有路。」</p>
<p>至於另一位，孫蘭小姐，爲了結婚，她也只好拋下莎士比亞和六十幾隻學分，去洗衣服，生風爐，燒飯。</p>
<p>老同學們都認爲是幸福的家庭，雖然有人似乎以爲再有個小孩子或者一隻梵啞鈴就更好，這不去管它，世界上哪有十全十美的事，是不是？</p>
<p>然而老D　却跑來告訴我，這一對夫妻吵了嘴。</p>
<p>「吵嘴算得什麼？」我飽經世故地說：「家常便領，有什麼大驚小怪？」</p>
<p>「可是這回相當嚴重。」老D搖搖頭：「孫蘭一氣之下，住在外面三天沒回去，害得我們那位敎育學士只好在家裏乾着急，吃陽春麺當晚飯。」</p>
<p>「爲什麼要吵起來呢？」</p>
<p>「不大明白，聽說有些桃色糾紛。」</p>
<p>「桃色糾紛？」我吃了一驚「不相信！我們那位敎育學士是君子人，規規矩矩的，不會。」</p>
<p>「我也不大仔細，這不過是從半官方得來的消息。』老D　笑一笑。　於是我決定去看一次他們。　那個「幸福的家庭」是在一個假三樓層上，屋頂不高，伸一伸手可以摸到天花板。這屋子我原是非常熟悉的，第一天來看房十也是我陪老熙來的，屋子的主人結了婚後，我也是一個常來的座上客，不瞞你說，閉了眼我也背得出墻壁上掛的是誰的風景畫，窗檯上放的是些什麼零星小物件，檯上那塊裂成三塊的玻璃板下又是壓着些訛的照相。</p>
<p>老熙，那個敎育學士，倒在床上。我進來，也沒化起來。</p>
<p>「究竟什麼把戲？好好地又吵起來。」我坐下在床邊。</p>
<p>他嘆口氣，搖搖頭。半天，才哼一句：</p>
<p>「老袁啊！做人眞沒意思。」</p>
<p>「算了吧！少發牢騷。」我欄住他：「到底怎麼　事？五六年里艱之交了有什麼不能說的？我不是聽你嘆氣來的。」</p>
<p>考慮從床上站起來，摸出半包烟，給了我一支。</p>
<p>「聽老D說，好像有點桃色糾紛，是不是？」我吐了一口烟，望着他：「不過，我知道的，老D就喜歡故間誇張，惟恐天下不亂。究竟是怎麼的？」</p>
<p>事情却原來很節單。老熙公司裏有一位女同事，會計部裏的，上海人管這　小姐們呌「花瓶」的。可是前而說過，我們邱位敎育學士是規矩人，他當然不會跟別人一樣，拿人　眞的　寫字間裹的裝飾，而且，老實說，他確實有這麼一個野心，要拿這位小姐「敎育」得好起來。</p>
<p>一來二去，不知怎麼一來　了巧。那一天，落寫字間，他們—老熙和那位小姐—在大馬路上，給孫闌在電車上瞧見，那位唸熟莎士比亞的小妞，有她那份濃厚的情感，一回到家就忍不住限淚，她伏在床上傷心地哭泣着，甚至連老熙回來都不理睬。</p>
<p>第二天——</p>
<p>「第二天，她一早出去。」老熙停了一下，又接下去：「一早就出去，話也不說一句，就此一去不回來。」</p>
<p>「你可知道在什麼地方呢？」</p>
<p>「老熙說在小徐家裏。我打電話問她，她也不否認。」</p>
<p>「那麼你打算怎麼樣？」我問：「我可以替你跑一趟。」</p>
<p>「不打算怎麼樣，只想解釋一下。要說的，都也詳詳細細地跟你說了，信不信由你，說不說也由你。」</p>
<p>我到小徐家裏。</p>
<p>「來替老煦做說客，是不是？」小徐替我開了門。</p>
<p>「想做和平使者而已。」我笑笑：『孫蘭這兩天過得好麼？」</p>
<p>「好！—一會兒抱怨，一會兒溫習舊夢，一會兒又眼淚汪汪。」</p>
<p>我跟小徐走到樓上。</p>
<p>孫闌迎着我又是一大段牢騷。</p>
<p>「小姐，我剛剛聽了滿腹牢騷來的。我說：「兩個人都像有一肚子話要說，都是懊悔，嘆氣，可爲什麼還要鬧撇扭？」</p>
<p>我並沒拿老熙吿訴我的又說一遍，這些事等將來老熙自己再吿訴她不更有興趣麼？</p>
<p>一小時後，我跟她跳上一輛三輪東。小徐送我們出來，向我說：</p>
<p>「以後要是再跑出來，我要我着你這個和平使者！」</p>
<p>一路上，孫蘭可還是訴不淸的苦，她不停地叙述着老熙怎樣地常是工作到八九點鐘才回來，叫人等飯等得心焦，　又是怎樣地不够用，有一回，爲了要　一位老同學的喜宴，她跟老　商量，打算買一雙皮鞋，而老熙只說：</p>
<p>「　年頭　撮在什麼　？小姐！」</p>
<p>「話也的確不錯。」孫闡向我說：「可是，　也是外表，他爲的什麼也知道每天　制　　亮，西裝褲放在枕頭底下壓得筆挺呢？」</p>
<p>我該驚訝，這結婚以後的一年來，生活拿這位西洋文學系的小姐變到這個地步。</p>
<p>「也好。」我想：『　她磨鍊磨鍊也好。一朶暖室裏的花原是經不住風吹雨打的。」</p>
<p>到了那個伸出手可以摸到天花板的假三層裏，老熙還在躺在床上，抽着烟。烟霧瀰漫了一屋子。我打開奮子，讓春天的晚風吹進。</p>
<p>孫蘭一句話也沒說。—正如她底名字，她原是一個幽靜的人。—一進門，先是在檯子旁呆坐了一會，終於捲起袖口，彎下身，打算生風爐了，</p>
<p>我向老熙望望，他坐了起來。</p>
<p>「我對不起你。阿蘭—」他走到她背後：「這些日子來，爲了生活，我一直沒顧到你。」</p>
<p>孫蘭沒回答，低下　，有淚珠落下。</p>
<p>這該是不是我吿辭的時候了呢？</p>
<p>「好了。」這才對我站起身來：「生活第一。少鬧那些少爺小姐們的蹩扭吧！」</p>
<p>「不吃了晚飯去麼？」孫蘭抬起淚痕縱橫的臉。</p>
<p>「別客氣。過雨天我會再來的。晚安：」我向那對靑竿的夫妻鞠了一躬。</p>
<p>說故事的到這兒　吿個結束，抱歉的也許會使你失望，　故事一點也不中聽，是不是？它沒有曲折的情節，也沒有美麗的描寫。沒有，甚至遷一個出奇的結尾都沒有。可是，先生，前面我說過，不用怪作者，這原是一支平凡的故布，平凡的故事。</p>

<h3>慈善籃球賽　評述首兩塲戰績　今晚華聯與巨人决戰</h3>
<p>南市國際救濟醫院及南市保黎醫院，爲籌募兩院經費，特委託華聯藥廠總經理張溎祥舉辦籃球義賽三塲，在本月十日十二日十四日　八仙橋靑年會健身房舉行。其第一第二兩塲已分別賽過，最後一塲，則於今夜舉行。</p>
<p>按此次三塲，純由華聯出面，而向中北汕隊借將，出抗西人蒙諾克及巨人隊，在此籃球季節，巳經過去聲中，有此中西籃球明星大會串，亦球迷之眼福不淺。茲補評前二塲戰情及研討今夜之戰。</p>
<h3>首塲蒙隊輕取華聯</h3>
<p>義賽第一幕於十日舉行，爲華聯借汕隊混合成軍對蒙諾克，結果華聯不幸以十七對三十敗績。</p>
<p>觀察蒙諾克之所以勝，完全利用其人長作籃下跟進爲得分之捷徑，長人浮尾克即爲主要人物。而華聯方面，未能注意及此。後衛方面，不能用一有躍高之後衛以阻止，遂爲所算，宜其失敗也。談華聯在忽忽聯合汕隊，事前並無縝密研究，乃上塲我行我素，以至全屬個人表演，絕鮮合作功夫。反之，蒙諾克全隊爲其隸於一隊之同志，試問華聯將以何取勝耶？故綜論此收，爲應有之結果。</p>
<h3>次塲整飭華聯終勝</h3>
<p>第二塲十二日舉行，山華聯再向中北借用將士，以厚實力，仍戰蒙諾克。賽前並有揷曲一幕，爲胖隊鬥老爺。查老爺軍爲新興勁敵，山汪仲陶張溎祥主持，其隊員年齡，限定在三十六歲以上，庶幾附合老爺名義也。胖隊亦屬畸形隊之一，心曠神怡，雖屬爛大塊頭，劫因造詣之深，益以邇來練習甚殷，故演出有進無退。老爺人馬，亦過去鋒　一時之健將也。兩隊比賽，趨重於趣味化，勝負尙屬其次，其引人發噱處則甚多，確符合該兩隊約賽之原旨也。比賽結果，胖隊以較爲純熟，得以二六對二〇擊退老爺。然細察老爺除孔廣益余邭子莫談外，汪仲陶張溎祥王守方，寶刀已老，但球路尙存，如老爺等有機練習者，則在第二流球隊中，尙能縱橫，不識諸老爺有此雅與乎？</p>
<p>論第二戰華聯之再戰而勝蒙諾克之一役，厥爲賽前有相當考慮。張溎祥旣鑒於首戰之不利，故仍借用汕隊之馬燦希外，復向中北商借李震中陳學崇卓國榮包松圓四將，如此常屬調度不愁無方，所惜震中以事未能駕到爲憾。</p>
<p>比賽結果，華聯終以人材濟濟，得以二五對二四小勝一分。華聯勝因，最得力者爲後衛，觀乎馬燦希卓國榮包松圓三將，各有絕妙，尤以獲籃下球，三人在躍起截劫之時間問題，俱有深造。以致蒙隊之籃下跟進獲分一點，遂爲所破。華聯得分成功者，當爲徐菊生張良雄兩人，論功不可沒也。然事實最後數分鐘內菊生之太多浪擲，張良雄之鬆看勃脫，幾爲蒙隊超上，是則兩人之未能鎭靜之過也。蒙隊雖敗，其愈戰愈有勁之精神，人後則能以主將罰出，頻頻山後備軍上塲，尙能應用混戰一法，以亂我隊軍心，實屬非易</p>
<h3>今夜之戰勢必精彩</h3>
<p>今日尙餘最後一戰，仍由第二戰原班之華聯迎戰洋人巨頭巨人隊，賽前另加女子賽一塲，茲不妨略談今夜兩戰</p>
<h3>三省益康勢均力</h3>
<p>女子揷曲下午七時半先開塲，邀得三省益康對壘。按原意有諸綠隊出山之意，唯以綠隊之實力太强，對手難覓，乃約三省益康兩娘子軍。</p>
<p>查三省爲聯賽之亞軍，本屆自得陳祚良任指導後，進步極快，在戰衛方面，有顯著之成功，個人方面，陳榴珍之一日千里，當爲値得一書者。益康隊全由吳子彬一手訓練之新軍，論該隊之能循規蹈矩，應用方法打球，可稱能別樹一幟。但其所以未登峯造極者，筆者以爲其過於呆板，因方法是死的，應用則則發能隨機應變爲貴，否則　員決非機器，敢望能盡如人意乎？故益康如能稍求活潑，造就決不於此。再談今戰勝負關鍵，三省鄧秀椿應致少無的放矢，徒耗費獲球權爲要，况該隊前鋒功夫尙好，非無方法進襲也。守衛方面，則最宜注意犯規，蓋益康前鋒，阻擋避人極多，稍具性急者，輙多無謂犯規，如能審愼，三省能做到上述二點穩勝無疑，益康要勝，較爲艱難。所望者，亦即上述之能，略帶活躍而巳。如然，倖勝五六分，亦非絕對無望也。總之，兩隊實力，相差尙微，可望有剌激鏡頭。</p>
<h3>巨人狡猾華聯如何</h3>
<p>溯巨人消聲匿跡者久矣，但其成績，則確爲一般球迷所憧影者，此番內張溎祥之全力奔走，該隊毅然應戰，實使義賽生色不少，得益匪淺。</p>
<p>巨人之實力較蒙諾克為勝，焦點即在穩，如凱捷寗洛夫陶勃林基，沙司金昆仲，俱屬有智有謀，應用方法又多，攻人之短，利其所長，尤爲特點。</p>
<h3>盼李震中毅然助陣</h3>
<p>華聯仍　用第二塲之全部人馬，唯上次以事缺席之李震中，爲一致所希望能助陣者，則勝負莫論，精彩之點，必較多收猶也。</p>
<p>華聯最理想之陣容，余以爲後衛應屬馬燦希卓國榮包松圓，前鋒李震巾陳學宗張錦璇徐菊生張良雄有此八仙到齊，演出之精湛，調度者不致無方，收穫必大。試想，後方有此三將中之任何二人，拿籃下球，可保無慮，巨人其怎奈何我也。而前綫上應有震中之聰明來從中接濟，更須震中之長度來跟進，則餘子皆爲拿分好乎，豈有不水到渠成哉？</p>
<p>更望者，張溎祥應與汪仲陶戴昌齡通力在旁督戰研究調度，余敢云華聯可有七成勝望也</p>
<p>今賽門票二千元，雖似較貴，但所得券資，悉數捐滴歸公，開支山華聯藥廠負担，我人對華聯之出錢出力表示做偑我，更望熱心球逃，連袂而往，以襄善舉。（賢）</p>

<h3>參加綠隊主將　嚴蔚雯婚禮記</h3>
<p>— 梅潔</p>
<p>滬上女子籃球盟主綠隊嚴蔚雯小姐結婚的消息，上期筆者已述及，在前天承嚴小姐的當面邀請，乃得躬逢其盛，結婚是昨天（十三日）下午叫時，在花園酒樓。</p>
<p>筆者准四時到達，一進去，全是陌生的紅男綠女，不禁露出進退維谷的神情。這也許是生平少交際的關係，呆立有二分鐘的長久，有一位似曾相識的靑年來照呼，詢問之下，才知道是骷髏籃球隊的一位健將，是嚴小姐的鄰居，招待我坐立之後。</p>
<p>綠隊人馬絡續開到</p>
<p>先看見李缊芝楊文鵑項毓琳穿着像新娘同樣鮮艷的春裝來了。不一刻又見錢旭滄謝益欽王網乾也來了，這才算解決了枯坐的不安。在旭倉詼諧百出的談話中，汪印蘭·黃明媛·祝士茅。劉珍寶。王維珍·都來了。據說張敏知因在拍外景，黃杏芬以事不能駕到，但是我發覺還缺一位容淑綸，詢問之下，知道：</p>
<p>容小姐擔任總幹事</p>
<p>因爲接洽花園酒樓，是託容小姐辦理。原因當然容小姐有熟人的關係，容小姐受人之托，忠人之事，在各方面顧慮到有不週者，忙着再行佈置，眞不愧爲一總幹事，並且知道她正在樓上替新娘打扮，所以不看見。</p>
<p>結婚儀式充滿甜氣</p>
<p>結婚儀式，當然是那麼簡單隆重，但是因爲新嫁娘是笑臉時呈的關係，尤其値此大喜的良辰，何曾見到她閉過嘴，雪白的牙齒，始終露着。新郞袁君是蒼黑的面色，標準的身材，一望而知也是一位靑年運動家，誰料新郞也是一位善于笑的。因此在結婚時，祇見一對新人笑。祝士芳說：蔚雯有甜姐兒的雅號，這位新郞應該賜以「甜哥兒一的名義，眞的，一片笑聲中，那結婚儀式是充滿「甜」味。</p>
<p>林康侯爭看甜姐兒</p>
<p>在結婚熱鬧的笑聲中，筆者瞥見林康老立在最後，伸長了頭在瞧這位新娘，原來康老是在樓上另外有宴會，便道過此，爭看甜姐兒。</p>
<p>茶點一番所見所聞</p>
<p>結婚儀式完畢，賀客擁着新人大放紙捲紙屑送上扶梯後，開始茶點，旭滄是偷偷地溜了。注印蘭也不聲不響的走了。筆者與綠隊全體，正好一桌，劉珍寶除外，因爲她有前啓秀女籃隊的幾位老友們共桌暢談，計有李寶球—依然有運動員風味—李文寶似乎瘦了些—楊斐比—比較從前是苗條而嬌艷。傍桌爲骷髏籃球隊全體，因爲新娘的令弟嚴繼良也是該隊隊員。</p>
<p>幾乎誤為范慶公君</p>
<p>嚴繼良的輪廓，太像華聯北將范慶公，當嚴君昨天以主婚人身份，伴在新娘在音樂聲中緩步時，我幾乎就當他范慶公。</p>
<p>下次喜宴輸及容楊</p>
<p>吃吃談談之中，筆者談及今年似乎是女運動員結婚年。黃杏芬、史瑞娟、吳眞雄、昨天父是嚴蔚雯。火槪本年度還有幾位要請我吃　酒。黃叨媛立刻報吿，蔚雯之後，應爲淑儉文鵑兩位，容楊雖然表示着忸怩的樣子，却無聲無息的默認了。</p>
<p>今後綠隊繼續努力</p>
<p>綠隊是巾幗隊中的覇主，爲了一位位的結婚，已經有許多無巾生有的朋友在批評綠隊有瓦解的可能。但是昨天在席上，她們同聲表示決定繼績努力，並且將隨時隨地謀球藝上的進展，該隊幹事王網乾君爲鼓勵起見，答允贈送每球員新外套一件，全體的隊員，都向王君稱謝，是則我盼望綠隊以後上塲時有新的服裝之外，還有新的球藝，以嚮滬　球壇。</p>

<p>很多的靑年朋友，常常玩慣足球、籃球、綱球，以爲這種羽毛球是女子的玩耍。以爲輕輕的球拍，輕輕的羽毛球，小小的塲地，都够不上勇武有力的靑年們玩耍的。就是玩起來，也決沒有多大的興趣。所以有不少的靑年們，便輕視這種球戲！實在沒有經歷過的事情，不便武斷的。古人說得好：「事非經過不知難。」難不難，要親自經歷過，才能知道。有興趣，沒有興趣，也要看你的經歷深不深，才能够知道。比方入水學習游冰。初學的人，一到水裹，不但全無興趣，並且感覺得很多的難過。耳朶入水，會發出響的聲昔，眼睛入水裹，不能睜視，又有一些辣辣的刺激，這是一件多麼困難的事情！還有甚麼興趣呢？可是在我們會游泳的人，看起來，是非常有趣的事情，最好的玩意。因爲躍入水裏，沒入深處，自己便變做魚一般，前後進退，左右轉彎，多麼的自山自在。玻璃的世界裏，看得見各種東西。最有趣的是碰到游泳同伴，在水裹互相對視　各人的面形，都變得或長或短，或福而圓，或闊而大。唉！眞是奇異得很。這種興趣，不會游泳的朋友，怎樣會知道游泳的人，「如魚如鴨」的樂趣呢？沒有玩過羽毛球的人，怎能領司羽毛球的樂趣呢？如果你玩過幾次羽毛球，那麼使能够領略一些這種玩要的趣味，羽毛球最有趣的地方，就是在使得對手奔跑，跑又接不到，便勝一球。常你勝一球的時候，或勝一局的時候，比中了馬票，發了大財，打了勝仗，同樣的快樂，同樣的興抓盎然。若是進攻的猛球，得勝了一球，便暗自稱豪的樂趣。若是對手打來的球，非常兇猛，非常危險；我能够挽救出險，把球擊過網去。不但旁觀者拍乎呌好，而自己的快樂，比得黃金美女，還要快樂哩。若是一局已終，不論誰勝誰敗，臭汗一身，餘喘未息。此時休息，宛如勞働之工人在工作之後，樹陰休息，淸茶一杯，隨南面王不過也。</p>
<p>羽毛球的效益易流汗</p>
<p>玩羽毛球最有益的地方，就是很容易排洩臭汗。汗汁在生理學上，是一重不得不排出體外之妨害物。汗性質酸。因含鈉·雙氫硄强　等質，和屎相同，汗多必臭。其原故，是把體內的脂類酸散發，嘗之則鹼味。</p>
<p>假若汗含他種物質，積蓄在體內，那麼就影響到腎臟，立即身體感覺到不舒適。頭痛·發熱。鼻塞等病象發現了，因爲皮膚和腎臟，有非常密切的關係。尿多就汗少，汗多就尿少</p>
<h3>體壇拾零</h3>
<p>胖隊宋啓後近忙於尋覓房屋，因其原住，已出讓於人。</p>
<p>老爺隊希望記者及裁判亦組織成軍，俾與胖隊而成四路，作一單循環聯賽，噱頭必多。</p>
<p>李震中近有疏於球事之象，輙多灰心之語，殆亦有其苦衷之點。</p>
<p>中北趙稚林太太之酒量甚宏，聞有三斤紹興之量。</p>
<p>聯華銀行劉　民對足球素極熱心，上午曾舉辦聯華盃，小型足球賽，近聞最近有舉辦第二盃之意。（瘦）</p>
<h3>足球宿將</h3>
<p>— 老牛</p>
<p>上海在二十六七年前，足球祗有學校比賽。聖約翰大學與南洋大學比賽時，最爲熱烈，每塲觀衆均有萬人。兩校學生組織拉拉隊，高唱校歌及勝利歌，鑼鼓鞭砲，聲聞數里，較之今日球賽，另有一種熱鬧情形。約翰隊之前鋒爲現任上海足球聯合會理事長沈嗣良，脚頭準確。後衛係余衡之。共人善釘人，看住敵隊，忠心耿耿，且勇而有長力；人稱之曰老牛」。畢業後，營商之暇，任東華隊幹事頗久，旋即赴靑烏。戰事發生，在滬經營洋商股票。三年前返靑烏，現設店舖該地，頗爲順利。（韞·樂達觀。）</p>
<h3>國際盃複賽　中華隊失敗原因</h3>
<p>上週末在膠園舉行之國際盃複賽，中華對義大利，勝者獲決賽權外，對錦標前程，亦有絕對把握。蓋另一獲決賽權者爲北歐，究北歐之實力，無論如何，不及巾義兩軍也。</p>
<p>中華將士對於此賽，確亦抱破釜沉舟之決心，劇鬥九十分鐘，終以事實上之較遜一籌，一對二慘遭敗北，喪失國際盃問津機會。猶憶上屆賴東華之士氣正旺，直搗黃龍，奪奪皇座。此情此景，猶在目前。時隔一季，已讓胡兒，奪回榮譽，誠使我人執筆至此，不免有氣短之感觸焉。</p>
<p>四將被罰</p>
<p>考中華慘敗之前因，當爲賈幼良。韓龍海·李垚·吳祺祥四將之被罰，不得出席。夫幼良李垚之左右兩翼，環顧華隊新人中，尙少可與比擬之者，而龍海之連度，更可獨覇海上，吳祺祥之右後衛，全滬不作第二人想，則有此四員大將之被革，損失之重，無可再加，故此爲中華失敗之前因。</p>
<p>調度失策</p>
<p>其次當爲調度之失策，筆者曾一而三之批評宋靈聖決無與李寗合作前後衛之嘗試。宋仔喜術，李寗遲滯，漏洞之出，在所不免。致是日義軍所以賴右路之進襲，而爲獲兩球之大關鍵也。夫既有試宋仔左移之冒險，盍不若以鐔福積一試爲可靠，筆者始終不信。老鐔不能為前衛，與阿戴之不踢有鋒，同為我人所不得要領之疑問也。</p>
<p>缺少練習</p>
<p>再則李義臣之一籌莫展，大有行路維艱之慨，此果亦爲始料所不及者。據悉，李因奔波於上海崇明間，無暇練習，以致如此，則我人無可苛責。唯亦可鑒球事之重於練習，決非徒負盛名而可操穩勝者也。</p>
<p>義軍雖賴於一只十二碼球而爲獲勝之主，但論其戰術及長力，確皆有進境之點，前鋒綫上對連絡一點，頗知謹愼應付，而利用突破一法，又見漸有成熟。雖未成功，予華隊之威脅則確非淺鮮。余頗覺該隊前鋒對於智力及盤傳再加深造，射門功夫，加以殷練，實有無窮之前途焉。</p>
<p>義軍之守衛，如銅牆鐵壁，實不虛傳。蓋其隊員脚頭之硬，身胚之結實，各盡其本位，兵來將擋，於是令人望風披糜矣。進而論之，義軍之守衛無腦力，設能用誘騙之計，純熟之小傳遞而進襲者，必可收事半功倍之效。惜我中華將士，倉卒成軍，鳥合之衆，奈其徒有心願，而力不及耳。</p>
<p>中華旣敗，唯有眼看錦標落於夷人之手，則唯冀望明年此日，再顯我威風於球塲上矣（嘉）</p>

<h3>Roosevelt Suffers Cerebral Hemorrhage, Dies in Warm Springs Yesterday, Funeral to be Held This Afternoon, Burial Tomorrow</h3>

The President had been resting in Warm Springs for the past ten days. Upon Roosevelt's death, Vice President Truman was immediately notified. After receiving the urgent telegram, Truman rushed to the White House, where he was informed of the details of the passing by the First Lady. The Secretary of State also received the report and immediately convened a cabinet meeting, deciding to hold the funeral in the East Room of the White House on the afternoon of the 14th, and to bury him in Hyde Park on the afternoon of the 15th.</p>
<p>Geneva, 12th (Central News Agency Telegram) - German News Agency reports, Washington dispatch: President Roosevelt's secretary, Mr. O'Leary, stated that Mrs. Roosevelt and Roosevelt's physician, Dr. McIntyre, are scheduled to fly to Warm Springs this afternoon.</p>

<h3>U.S. State Department Makes Emergency Decision, Truman Succeeds as President, Issues First Message Declaring Continued Warfare, Orders San Francisco Conference to Proceed as Planned</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency Telegram) - After receiving notification from the White House at 5:25 PM on the 12th, Vice President Truman rushed to the White House by car. At 6:00 PM, he convened an emergency cabinet meeting. After discussion, it was decided, in accordance with Article 60 of the United States Constitution, that Vice President Truman would ascend to become the 32nd President. Truman was immediately sworn in and requested that the members of the State Department remain in their positions. Truman was originally a judge from Missouri. After the implementation of the national defense plan in the spring of 1935, he served as the chairman of the Senate Military Production Investigation Committee, working hard to increase military production, overcome many difficulties, and implement national mobilization. He established a major central force in Congress and subsequently gained Roosevelt's trust and was selected as Vice President. Therefore, it is anticipated that his future policies will continue to adopt a strict general mobilization approach. Truman is 61 years old this year. During the previous Great War, he served as a captain in a heavy artillery regiment and went to the front lines for combat, possessing practical combat experience.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a Reuters dispatch: Truman will turn 61 on May 8th. He was first elected as a Senator on November 6, 1934, and was re-elected on November 5, 1940, with his term expiring on January 3, 1947. He was nominated as the Vice Presidential candidate at the Democratic Party Convention last summer.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency Telegram) - In his first message released on the 12th, he declared that the United States will use all its strength to continue the war on both the Eastern and Western fronts.</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 13th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a Washington message relayed from Chongqing, Truman has requested that all heads of the original government departments remain in their positions. He also issued a hand-written order to the State Department that the San Francisco Conference must be held on the 25th as originally planned. According to Chongqing broadcasting, Chiang Kai-shek was deeply saddened upon hearing the news of President Roosevelt's death and expressed his feelings, vowing to accomplish President Roosevelt's unfinished goals.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Connally, stated: The San Francisco Conference on the United Nations' discussion of world security organizations may be postponed due to Roosevelt's death, but the State Department stated that the San Francisco Conference will not be suspended due to the President's death.</p>
<h3>Mrs. Roosevelt Notifies Four Sons</h3>
<p>Central News Agency - After the death of U.S. President Roosevelt, Mrs. Roosevelt sent the following message to her four sons, who are currently serving in the military: "Father passed away this afternoon. Roosevelt, as we expected, carried out his work until the very last moment. Wishing you all happiness in the future. We should cooperate with each other even more from now on."</p>
<h3>Churchill and Others Extremely Disturbed</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The news of Roosevelt's death caused a major shock to the British government and public. The British people were extremely astonished by this unexpected event. Reporters from various countries went to the British government to inquire about Churchill's opinion, but British government officials informed them that Churchill was extremely disturbed after receiving the news of Roosevelt's passing, and therefore they were unable to ascertain the Prime Minister's opinion today.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a report from the Associated Press correspondent in Chongqing, Chiang Kai-shek received the shocking news of Roosevelt's death while having breakfast. He was stunned for a moment, stopped eating, and showed a sorrowful expression. Chiang had met with Roosevelt in Cairo in 1943 and regarded Roosevelt as a sincere friend of Chongqing, holding him in boundless admiration. Key figures in Chongqing also believe that Roosevelt's death is a major setback for the anti-Axis forces. It is also deeply regrettable that Roosevelt passed away before seeing the end of the war.</p>
<h3>Major Impact on the Anti-Axis Camp</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Roosevelt's sudden death occurred during the critical period when the anti-Axis countries were urgently working to complete the war. Therefore, it is like a bolt from the blue for the anti-Axis. Since the outbreak of the European war, Roosevelt actively aided Britain and harmed Japan's position in East Asia, adopting hostile actions that forced Japan to take up arms for self-defense, leading to the world war. He was truly the culprit behind the war. He was also a proponent of aggressive navalism and economic imperialism, the main culprit in disrupting world peace. As for his political skills, he was an outstanding talent among American presidents throughout history. Roosevelt fully demonstrated extraordinary talent in rebuilding the domestic system and promoting American foreign policy after the New Deal. In this war, he was also the leader guiding the anti-Axis camp. Therefore, his sudden death has had a very heavy and great impact on the United States domestically. The American political circles after Roosevelt's death have lost their supreme wartime leader and will gradually fall into chaos. Whether Truman can inherit Roosevelt's legacy and strongly maintain the domestic wartime system remains doubtful. The San Francisco Conference, which is about to be held, will lose Roosevelt as its chairperson. The psychological impact on the anti-Axis countries can be imagined. Most importantly, the alliance of the three giants, Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin, has collapsed due to Roosevelt's death. During this war, Roosevelt and Churchill have truly worked together wholeheartedly to guide the anti-Axis camp in combat. Therefore, Roosevelt held a very important position among the three giants. Churchill's position has been shaken after losing Roosevelt, which will have a great impact on the future war strategies of the anti-Axis forces.</p>
<h3>Japanese Imperial Headquarters Announces Results of Battle on Okinawa Island Yesterday, Continues to Sink and Destroy 21 Enemy Ships</h3>

The confirmed results are as follows: 2 battleships sunk, 3 cruisers sunk, 1 transport ship sunk, 2 ships of unknown type sunk, 3 aircraft carriers damaged, 4 cruisers damaged, 3 destroyers damaged, 1 transport ship damaged, and 2 torpedo boats damaged.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Since the U.S. military began its invasion operation on Okinawa Island on March 23rd, up to the 13th of this month, the Japanese military's special attack teams, air force, and naval forces have launched fierce attacks, achieving significant results. The overall results of the Japanese military that have been announced by the Imperial Headquarters are as follows: 171 enemy ships sunk, 9 enemy ships damaged or sunk, and 134 enemy ships damaged. The total number of ships sunk or damaged is 314, achieved in just two weeks, creating a record of over 300 ships. The great achievements of the Japanese military can be described as unprecedented.</p>
<p>A Certain Base in the Nansei Islands, 13th (Central News Agency Telegram) - A new Japanese special attack team fiercely attacked the enemy fleet group around Okinawa on the afternoon of the 12th, achieving the following results: 2 battleships bombed and sunk, 1 cruiser hit by a torpedo, and 1 aircraft carrier damaged. The speed of the damaged aircraft carrier was visibly reduced, making it a target for Japanese attack aircraft. To cover the operation, the latest Japanese fighter planes were dispatched on the Nansei Islands front. In an encounter over Kikai Island with approximately 60 giant enemy aircraft, 23 were shot down after a battle. The enemy aircraft then fled. The Japanese side suffered the loss of one suicide plane and another plane was forced to land.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>After Roosevelt's Death</h3>
<p>U.S. President Roosevelt passed away from a cerebral hemorrhage on the 11th of this month, plunging the domestic situation into chaos. Its future trend deserves special attention.</p>
<p>Roosevelt, a scion of an aristocratic family, has been elected as U.S. President since defeating Hoover on November 8, 1932, and was repeatedly elected as President in 1936, 1940, and 1944, breaking the American political convention, which is a rare phenomenon in the world. During his more than twelve years in power, from the implementation of the so-called "New Deal" to participation in World War II, we will not discuss his merits and demerits or the evolution of the domestic and foreign political situation in the United States, but as far as the Greater East Asia War is concerned, he was clearly the direct instigator. Today, it is not yet the time to infer a comprehensive transformation of the United States' political and military strategies simply because the originator of the East Asia War has died. Therefore, it is inevitable that Roosevelt's death will greatly impact the United States' overall political and strategic situation, affecting its domestic and foreign policies and operations. This is our first point of observation regarding the enemy United States' movements after Roosevelt's death.</p>
<p>Whether Roosevelt's more than twelve years in power were good for the United States and the world is one thing, but it is also universally acknowledged that he was one of the main figures in modern international politics. Domestically, he gradually became an idol in the minds of the national people, leading to the fact that he was elected four times in a row. In the future, it will not be easy, or even impossible, for the United States to find a figure like Roosevelt who can represent financial, industrial, and capitalist interests. Internationally, he negotiated between the conflicting camps of Britain and the Soviet Union, and through the Tehran and Crimea conferences, he was able to temporarily reduce the suspicion and improve the relations among the three countries of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, which were deeply contradictory. In the future, it will be difficult to find someone among these three countries who is good at rhetoric to maintain their connection! Therefore, after Roosevelt's death, the internal chaos in the United States and the surfacing and aggravation of the opposition between the three countries of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union are likely to be inevitable. This is our second point of observation regarding the movements of the enemy United States and the enemy camp after Roosevelt's death.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Roosevelt has been the supreme commander of the enemy's land, sea, and air forces. In terms of the enemy United States' strategy, he was the most resolute advocate of a counteroffensive against the Japanese mainland. In terms of the anti-Axis camp's global strategy, he was also the staunch advocate of the strategy of attacking the Pacific before Europe, or at least attacking it simultaneously with Europe. Because of his firm stance, he caused opposition between the three countries of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and between the key generals of the enemy United States. Now that Roosevelt has died, the strategy of the enemy Britain and the anti-Axis camp will inevitably be greatly affected. This is our third point of observation regarding the movements of the enemy United States and the enemy camp after Roosevelt's death.</p>
<p>The one who succeeds Roosevelt and exercises the power of president and commander-in-chief is the current Vice President Truman. Although he is a successor to Roosevelt's policies politically, his qualifications are ultimately too shallow. It remains a question whether he can cope with the complex and critical situation in the United States. As for the military commander-in-chief aspect, he may not be able to grasp the current huge-scale war situation, so it is inevitable that the enemy United States will experience a major chaos and dispute in its strategic and command issues in the future. As for diplomacy, Truman's position is not as good as succeeding Roosevelt's, so without mentioning other things, the San Francisco Conference scheduled to be held on April 25 may completely lose the original convening significance of the United States.</p>
<p>To sum up, we can see that the enemy has entered new political, military, and diplomatic difficulties. We East Asian peoples must further unite and cooperate, seize the opportunity, and crush the enemy's strategy to win the final victory.</p>
<h3>Land and Air Forces Coordinate Operations, Kamikaze Squads Fiercely Attack Enemy Ships</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Since the weather near Okinawa Island improved on the 11th, the Japanese Army Air Force has closely coordinated and repeatedly attacked enemy ships and mobile forces, expanding the results of the battle.

The Japanese garrison forces in Nakagusuku Bay and Tsuda Island are also engaged in combat with enemy forces.</p>
<p>Nansei Islands Base, 13th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to reconnaissance reports on the 12th of the enemy mobile forces around Okinawa: On the sea surface 100 kilometers northeast of the island, there are three enemy fleets, with six regular aircraft carriers and two special aircraft carriers as their main force, all sailing southwest. Furthermore, around the island, there are still seven battleships, ten cruisers, fourteen destroyers, fifty-five transport ships, and approximately forty landing craft, constantly shelling the Japanese land positions.</p>

<h3>Japanese Forces Launch Extermination Campaign in the Philippines</h3>

Two bills were passed: the bill to establish the National Volunteer Corps and the bill on combat organizations for national response in urgent situations. The meeting adjourned at 12:30 PM.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency Telegram) - After Finance Minister Hirose decided to appoint Masamichi Yamagiwa, the former Director-General of the General Affairs Bureau, as the Vice Minister of Finance, the appointment was immediately made. At the same time, the resignations of Hamada, the Director-General of the Monopoly Bureau, and Sugita, the Director of the Mint Bureau, were approved. The selection of candidates for the Director-General of the General Affairs Bureau and the Director of the Banking and Insurance Bureau will be determined after the reform of the Finance Ministry's official system.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Because the Vice Minister of Agriculture and Commerce, Ishiguro, resigned, it was decided to appoint Mototame Yugawa, the current Director-General of the Food Administration Bureau.

<h3>Zhao Xuanchang Discusses Promoting the Film Industry, Paying Attention to Themes and Improvements</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 13th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The film industry is a tool for promoting cultural education, and its mission is quite important. Minister Zhao Xuanchang, in view of this, recently went to Shanghai to reorganize the China Film Company, personally assuming the position of chairman. It is believed that in the future, under Minister Zhao's guidance, the film industry will be completely renewed. After returning to Nanjing, Minister Zhao made the following remarks on this matter: "The film industry has the mission of cultural education, which goes without saying. Although the films of China Film Company cannot be said to be perfect, films such as 'Ten Thousand Generations of Glory', 'Long Live Teachers', and 'Repentance is at Hand' cannot be said to be unrelated to cultural education. Although general films may not be as good as those listed above, they are not without their merits. In the future, after I take office as the chairman of the company, I will naturally pay attention to them."</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Shot Down and Destroyed Over Tokyo and Fukushima</h3>

<h3>Chongqing Communist Party Representative Departs for the U.S.</h3>

<h3>Vice President of the Judiciary, Zhu Luhe, Passes Away</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 13th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Vice President of the Judicial Yuan, Zhu Luhe, passed away in Beijing at Hai hour (9-11 PM) on the 11th, at the age of 71. Zhu was a native of Jiaxing, Zhejiang. He dedicated his life to the Party and the country and had a long history of service in the judicial field. He served as the Acting Minister of the Ministry of Justice and other positions. After the return of the capital, he served as the Vice President of the Judicial Yuan and concurrently as the Chairman of the Central Civil Service Disciplinary Committee. News of his death was deeply regretted by all parties.</p>
<h3>The U.S. Attitude of Fooling the Chongqing Communists</h3>
<p>Harley, the U.S. Ambassador to Chongqing, who was responsible for mediating the Chongqing-Communist Party compromise negotiations as a "Lu Zhonglian" (a famous persuader in Chinese history), left Chongqing with the U.S. commander in Chongqing, Wittmeyer, on February 28 to return to the United States. After this, a major change in the U.S. attitude towards Chongqing can be expected. Given the complex situation in which even U.S. pressure could not make the Chongqing Communists compromise, Harley will offer his country advice based on his painful experiences, and Wittmeyer will also report truthfully that the Chongqing Communist armies are only focused on civil war and are not making efforts to resist Japan. Since the top officials of the U.S. in Chongqing for both diplomatic and military affairs have both called for improving U.S. policy towards Chongqing based on a new understanding of Chongqing, the U.S. authorities will certainly have to consider it carefully.</p>
<p>Therefore, both Chongqing and Yan'an are sure to be paying close attention to what specific form the new U.S. attitude towards Chongqing will take. Whether the United States will support Chongqing or support Yan'an will determine the fate of both Chongqing and the Communist Party. On this point alone, it can be seen that Chongqing and the Communist Party are watching the true intentions of the United States with bloodshot eyes. Harley, who was staying in Washington, answered questions from reporters on the 2nd about the Communist Party's request for the United States to supply weapons, saying, "In our opinion, supplying weapons to a certain armed political group is tantamount to the United States recognizing a new belligerent group. But the United States recognizes and supports the Chongqing government." This makes it clear that the U.S. government only supports Chongqing and does not intend to supply weapons to Yan'an. This is of great significance, because it indicates the new policy of America's attitude towards Chongqing.</p>
<p>The attitude of the United States towards Chongqing that has been coming since last year has almost been one of criticizing Chongqing and supporting Yan'an, even citing the Mihailović regime and Tito regime of Yugoslavia as examples, calling Chongqing the Mihailović regime of China and attacking it fiercely. But towards Yan'an, the U.S. praised its democratic policies and, disregarding Chongqing's opposition, sent foreign journalists to inspect the Communist areas. At the end of January of this year, the American Red Cross sent about ten tons of medicines and medical equipment. The US's approach to Yan'an was rapidly progressing. Yan'an also catered to the United States, making various gestures to seek its aid in weapons and military supplies, and offering exchange conditions such as setting up secret airfields for the US military in the Communist areas, skillfully using the attitude of America to strengthen its political offensive against Chongqing.</p>
<p>But the US approach to Yan'an was merely a tactic to needle Chongqing in the service of pressuring the Chongqing government to rely more on the US while sacrificing Chongqing and Communist forces in the fight against Japan. And Harley's sudden change of heart after returning home, turning his back on Yan'an, is just trying to use the "support Chongqing" label as another tactical maneuver. Yan'an was of course greatly surprised by this sudden cold attitude from America; Xinmin Daily News, its official newspaper, published an editorial on the 5th that said: "Harley ignored the Chinese people's demands for democracy, greatly increasing the difficulty of Yan'an to unify China. It would not be an exaggeration to say that Harley's statement is enough to split China and contains the crisis of instigating internal strife." It expressed much resentment toward America's coldness. In short, it can be seen from the facts above that both Chongqing and Yan'an have been fooled by the United States; or at least that the so-called "China policy" of the United States has never considered promoting the welfare of the Chinese people.

<h3>Sinking of Japanese Ship Awamaru: Remarks by Information Bureau Chief Iguchi on the Incident</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – Regarding the sinking of the Japanese ship Awamaru by a U.S. submarine, Iguchi, the third chief of the Information Bureau, met with foreign correspondents on the 13th to discuss the matter. He stated that concerning the Awamaru's voyage to the south, the U.S. government's notification of safe passage, relayed by the Swiss Legation in Tokyo on December 13th of last year, stated, "The United States and its allies will not attack or impede in any way the ship's transport of relief supplies to the south." However, the ship was eventually sunk, with a considerable loss of life. To date, the U.S. has not provided any notification regarding this incident. The Awamaru was traveling along a route jointly determined by Japan and the U.S. On March 30th (three days before the sinking), the Japanese government duly informed the U.S. government of a partial change in the ship's route, with the expectation that the ship would enter Tsuruga Port on April 5th. However, contact was lost from the evening of April 1st. The Japanese government expressed great concern about this but continued to believe in the U.S. government's guarantee of safety and awaited news. During a meeting with the press corps on April 6th, I mentioned that the ship would transport American relief supplies from the Soviet Union after returning from the south, and the Swiss Legation in Tokyo would notify the U.S. of this intention. However, the U.S. government did not respond. On April 11th, ten days after the ship was sunk, I also mentioned the ship's location during a meeting with foreign correspondents and stated that the Japanese government was requesting a response from the U.S. regarding this matter. However, as of April 12th, the U.S. government had not yet announced the sinking of the ship and only stated that one American survivor had been rescued. This person identified the sunken vessel as the Awamaru. It is inconceivable that the U.S. could not identify the Awamaru, as it was equipped with many lights and illuminated markings in accordance with Japanese-U.S. agreements, making it extremely easy to recognize in the surrounding waters. Moreover, after the ship was sunk, a considerable number of survivors remained at sea. Yesterday, the Japanese government, through the Swiss Legation, informed the U.S. government, reporting the details of the incident, as well as the number of rescued persons, their names, locations, health conditions, and handling procedures.</p>

An excerpt from the Municipal Government's notice is as follows:</p>
<p>"It has been found that the special consumption tax is an important source of tax revenue under the wartime system, and the scope of collection is based on the amount of consumption, which is extremely fair. However, this tax has always been collected and remitted by various stores. A special consumption tax invoice has now been produced, ordered to be sold by the district tax collection offices, with each book containing 200 invoices. Apart from recovering the printing costs of 170 yuan, no other fees will be charged. All retail stores in this city should purchase and prepare them as soon as possible. From April 15th of this year, they must be used uniformly. If any store delays using these special tax invoices, once discovered or reported, they will be severely punished. The attached rules for collecting special tax invoices are hereby announced for general knowledge." Attached rules:</p>
<p>(Article 1) All retail stores that collect special consumption tax must use special tax invoices.</p>

<p>(Article 3) Special tax invoices are small, two-part forms printed with sequential numbers, the price of the item, the tax amount, and the date. The store must affix its seal and address. The first part is given to the buyer, and the second part is the stub, which the store must retain for one full year for inspection by the Bureau at any time.</p>
<p>(Article 4) Special tax invoices are printed by the Bureau and sold by the district tax collection offices. Each book contains 200 invoices. Apart from recovering the cost of paper and printing, no other fees will be charged.</p>
<p>(Article 5) Whenever a store purchases special tax invoices, it must purchase at least enough for one month's use and keep a register to record the date of purchase, the number of books, and the starting and ending numbers in detail for verification.</p>
<p>(Article 6) Companies and businesses that use their own pre-numbered invoices that can be verified and have been approved by the Bureau are exempt from the provisions of these rules.</p>

<h3>Strengthening Industry Associations, Reorganization to Begin</h3>
<p>In order to adapt to the wartime system and strengthen the organizational structure of industry associations, the Municipal Bureau of Economics has begun reorganization work based on established policies. It is conducting surveys of associations externally and audits internally. It is expected that after the adjustment and strengthening of various industry associations in the future, their superior achievements in government policy implementation and member benefits can be expected. It is understood that there are more than 240 industry associations in the city, with a total of approximately 300,000 members in industry and commerce, which indicates their importance in the city. The Bureau's survey of associations has received approximately 80-90% of the forms. Once all the survey forms are received, the following two points will be followed according to the proposed plan: Reorganization: (A) Ordered to be handled, (B) Needs to be reorganized, such as those that are unsound or have disputes, and should be merged or reduced. Management: Such as investigation, opinion, review, guidance, and management departments, to thoroughly improve and strengthen the personnel, institutions, and organizations of these unsound associations. The former reorganization part is being submitted to the Municipal Government for approval, while the latter management part has been handled separately according to established procedures.</p>
<h3>Police Bureau Holds Bureau Affairs Meeting</h3>
<p>The Municipal Police Bureau held its tenth Bureau Affairs Meeting yesterday (13th) morning at 11:00 AM in the Bureau's building. The meeting was presided over by Director Zhou, who also serves concurrently as Mayor. Deputy Directors Du Zhengjian, Lu Ying, and various Section Chiefs Man Qiwei, Hiraoka Isamu, Li Shiyu, Sugihara, Xiong Jie, Guo Shaoyi, Xiang Jiwu, Shimizu Kiyomi, and Police Chief Tsukazaki, Security Police Chief Li Yuanchu, and others attended.

<h3>Slaughterhouse Severely Punished for Selling Diseased Pork</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government previously received a tip that the Ningxia Road slaughterhouse was allowing carcasses of livestock and cattle with tuberculosis to be transported into the city market for sale. It ordered the Secretariat to send personnel to investigate secretly. It was found that Gu Heting, the meat inspection technician at the slaughterhouse, did indeed stamp diseased pork with a blue "Inspected" mark and allow merchants to transport it to the Qian Da Meat Shop at 181 Ningxia Road for retail sale. The Municipal Government believes that diseased livestock should be destroyed according to regulations and should not be disguised as fresh meat for consumption by citizens. The slaughterhouse technician was clearly derelict in his duties. The diseased pork was sent to the Bureau for destruction, and technician Gu Heting was first dismissed from his post, along with Zheng Lingjiu, the owner of the Qian Da Meat Shop, and ordered the Police Bureau to investigate and prosecute them according to law. As for Wang Cheng, the director of the slaughterhouse, and Chen Shunyun, the section chief in charge of meat inspection at the Bureau of Health, and Huang Guoyou, the director of the meat inspection section, who were negligent in their duties, were given a demerit. The Bureau of Health was strictly ordered to ensure that slaughterhouse inspections were carried out conscientiously and thoroughly in the future to protect the health of citizens.</p>
<h3>Impersonating Bureau of Finance Staff, Defrauding Money, Arrested</h3>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Finance recently discovered that citizens Zhao Jieren, Gao Tianyou, Yu Hengyang, and staff members Fang Cuikang and Qian Shihua dared to impersonate staff members of the Bureau and repeatedly defraud the Queen and other theaters of money. An order was given for a strict investigation, and Zhao Jieren and others were arrested for interrogation. Except for Yu Hengyang, Fang Cuikang, and Qian Shihua, whose involvement was less serious and were allowed to be released on bail pending further questioning, and Fang Cuikang and Qian Shihua were dismissed and forced to return their graduation certificates from the Tax Personnel Training Class, Zhao Jieren and Gao Tianyou have been transferred to the Police Bureau for further investigation and prosecution.</p>
<h3>Port Authority Inspects and Registers Civilian Ships</h3>
<p>Since the Jianghai Customs Port Authority began registering civilian ships on the 1st of this month, there has been an enthusiastic response from Japanese shipowners applying at the Bureau. It is understood that the Bureau is now starting to inspect the ships applying for registration, and their tonnage and deadweight are being carefully reviewed. The Bureau is also preparing to issue registration certificates. Without these certificates, it will be forbidden to berth and navigate within the port area under the Bureau's jurisdiction.</p>
<h3>Mayor Zhou's Thoughts on the Death of Roosevelt</h3>
<p>Regarding the death of U.S. President Roosevelt, Mayor Zhou of this city expressed the following thoughts:</p>
<p>Popular Morale and Morale Inevitably Decline</p>
<p>U.S. President Roosevelt passed away yesterday. Roosevelt had served as President of the United States for four consecutive terms, a record unprecedented in American history. As far as we usually know, eight or nine out of ten Americans have a relatively deep faith in Roosevelt. Although they recognize that Roosevelt's engagement in the war at such a significant cost is not without its doubts, it ultimately failed to diminish the hope born of their faith. At this moment when the war situation on both the European and Pacific battlefields is becoming increasingly severe, the sudden death of the head of state of the United States, coupled with the fact that American public sentiment is easily agitated and the deep faith that Americans have long had in Roosevelt, American public sentiment is bound to decline under this stimulus, especially the impact on the morale on the battlefield will be profound and great. Even the San Francisco Conference, centered on the United States and the Soviet Union, which was preparing to open with excitement in the coming days, suddenly suffered this major change, making those who are overly optimistic about this conference inevitably present a shadow in their minds.</p>
<p>East Asian People Deeply Vigilant However, the United States has always been a so-called democratic country, and the sudden departure of the authorities who have been in their positions for a long time does have a great impact, but it cannot be considered that national policy is about to change. Based on the great righteousness of the 1 billion people of East Asia seeking liberation together, as well as the original intention of allied participation in the war, regardless of the situation or any changes on the other side, we can only be deeply vigilant and unremittingly strive. Moving forward towards the completion of the war cannot be easily viewed with optimism and self-indulgence to slacken our fighting spirit.</p>
<h3>Remarks by Director Matsudaira</h3>
<p>Director Matsudaira of the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy Information Department gave the following remarks on the 13th regarding the death of U.S. President Roosevelt:</p>
<p>Truman Lacks Qualifications</p>
<p>Roosevelt had forcefully used political and diplomatic means to guide external and internal affairs. Now, although he has suddenly passed away, the United States has lost its center of gravity, and the impact on its country and the anti-Axis camp is profound and great. Truman has been promoted to President with the qualification of Vice President, but Truman is an unknown person, and his experience is quite ordinary, and his political means are even more inferior. It is expected that Churchill will definitely be disappointed. Because Truman's qualifications are not as good as Roosevelt's, it will be difficult for him to stand in a guiding position on diplomatic policy towards Britain and the United States. Furthermore, with regard to the diplomacy of other South American countries, it is also difficult to expect him to exert any authority. As for the country, it will inevitably lead to friction and confrontation in Congress, and the relationship between the government and the military and naval chiefs stationed abroad will inevitably be in an irreparable state.</p>
<p>American Military and Political Circles are Pessimistic</p>
<p>An American correspondent criticized Truman, saying that he is just an ordinary old man rising from the darkness. Therefore, the American military and political circles are pessimistic about Truman, so it will inevitably have a significant impact on the soldiers' combat spirit in the future. For the time being, the original plans of the United States may not be changed temporarily, or even supplementary institutions may be established to assist Truman's incompetence. However, we must witness the tragedy encountered by dictatorial countries, inspire our ambition, and move towards the goal of destroying the proud enemy for the independence of a new China.</p>
<h3>Municipal Finance Bureau Sets Deadline for Reporting and Paying Business Tax; Late Fees Will Be Added After Month-End</h3>
<p>The Municipal Finance Bureau fully launched the city's spring business tax collection for the 34th year on April 1st. Many businesses have enthusiastically complied with the order to report and pay taxes. The tax collection offices in each district are submitting the collected tax revenue to the municipal treasury daily. However, there are still a considerable number of businesses that are hesitant, taking a wait-and-see approach, and delaying under various pretexts. It is reported that the bureau, in order to rigorously enforce tax policies and increase treasury revenue, has set the end of April as the final deadline for reporting and paying spring business tax. All spring business tax obligations must be reported and paid in accordance with regulations. If businesses miss the deadline due to their own negligence, the bureau will resolutely impose late payment penalties according to regulations. As stipulated in Article 16 of the collection regulations, a late payment penalty of 10% will be added for taxes reported and paid within ten days after the deadline, 20% for more than ten days, and suspension of business will occur for delays exceeding one month, along with the seizure of the tax due and late payment penalties. It is also understood that the Business Tax Section of the bureau completed its investigation on April 1st and immediately prepared a list, which was submitted to the bureau for dispatch of personnel for verification. It is reported that the previously established business tax collection regulations of this city are no longer applicable. After revisions, they were submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval and then sent to the bureau for implementation. Furthermore, the bureau has made slight modifications to the tax bracket for manufacturers based on their capital amount.</p>
<h3>Salt Administration Bureau Adjusts Heads of Subordinate Offices</h3>
<p>In order to expand the scope of salt administration management, the Songjiang District Supervisory Affairs Administration of the Ministry of Finance is currently strengthening the organization of its local offices.

<h3>Shanghai Office of the New China News Association Moves to New Location Yesterday</h3>

As the original two locations were insufficient for use and to facilitate contact from all parties, it was specifically moved to the 7th floor of the Datong Building at 17 The Bund starting yesterday (the 13th). The telephone numbers are 18014 and 16800.</p>

<h3>Provisional Regulations for Registration of Prime Mover Manufacturers</h3>
<p>The Municipal Construction Bureau believes that since the reduction in electricity supply in this city, factories have been installing prime movers for power generation. However, manufacturers installing such machinery often fail to apply to the bureau in advance, which is not in compliance with the law. Therefore, in order to standardize management, the bureau has submitted a request to the municipal government to handle the registration of prime mover manufacturers and has formulated provisional regulations, which will be announced and implemented immediately as follows:</p>
<p>Article 1: These regulations are formulated in accordance with Article 7 of the Shanghai Special Municipality Construction Bureau's Provisional Regulations for Handling the Installation of Prime Movers in Factories and Public Places.</p>
<p>Article 2: All entities engaged in the business of manufacturing, selling, or repairing any prime mover and its ancillary equipment, whether limited or unlimited partnerships, sole proprietorships, or stores, are collectively referred to as prime mover manufacturers in these regulations.</p>
<p>Article 3: Unless otherwise stipulated by laws and regulations, all prime mover manufacturers shall comply with the provisions of these regulations.</p>
<p>Article 4: Any prime mover manufacturer intending to operate in this city shall, in addition to filing with the Economic Bureau, submit the following items to this Bureau for registration: The name, address, and telephone number of the factory or store. The name and address of the store owner or manager, along with two personal photos. The nature of the organization and the type of business. Capital. Equipment (with attached drawings and descriptions). The positions and resumes of all technical personnel. The number of craftsmen and laborers employed. A registration fee of 500 yuan and a license fee of 500 yuan shall be paid with the application. The registration fee will not be refunded regardless of whether the application is approved or not.</p>
<p>Article 5: After a prime mover manufacturer's registration is approved by this Bureau, it shall pay a security deposit within seven days of receiving the notice. The amount shall be calculated at 2% of the capital, provided that if the capital is over 5 million yuan, a security deposit of 100,000 yuan shall be paid.</p>
<p>Article 6: A security deposit of 100,000 yuan shall be paid by the prime mover manufacturer. After paying the security deposit, this Bureau will issue a license, allowing it to operate in this city. This license shall be displayed prominently in the store.</p>
<p>Article 7: Any prime mover manufacturing factory or sales business established before the promulgation of these regulations shall complete the registration and licensing procedures in accordance with Articles 3, 4, and 5 within one month of the promulgation.</p>

If it fails to replenish the full amount, it shall be suspended from business until the full amount is replenished.</p>
<p>Article 13: If the security deposit paid by a prime mover manufacturer does not match its actual capital, this Bureau may order it to increase the deposit.</p>
<p>Article 14: After a prime mover manufacturer ceases operations, the original security deposit may be refunded upon surrendering the license after two months, upon presentation of the receipt issued by this Bureau.</p>
<p>Article 15: The validity period of a prime mover manufacturer's business license expires at the end of each year. If it wishes to continue operating, it shall exchange the license and pay a license exchange fee of 500 yuan. If it is found operating with an old license more than one month after the expiration date, it shall be handled in accordance with Article 11 of these regulations.</p>

<h3>Our Army, Our People</h3>
<p>— Koizumi Shinzo</p>
<p>The enemy planes' indiscriminate bombing was something we expected. As citizens, we should take responsibility, undertake all air defense work, and make it easier for the authorities to implement their policies, regardless of the size of the matter. We should all be aware that this is the only way to avenge our losses. There is no other way to punish arsonists and their masterminds.</p>
<p>Thoroughly Concentrate Combat Power</p>
<p>How should the military and the people fight? Major strategic matters are naturally left to the commanders, but one point that we laymen can also understand is that the most important thing is to thoroughly concentrate combat power. Military books say: "If you are prepared for everything, you are vulnerable everywhere." If you defend everywhere, you will be fragile everywhere. Isn't this a golden saying that we should reflect on today? Our country's combat power is definitely not abundant. If we want to use this not-so-abundant combat power to inflict a fatal blow on the enemy, the only policy is to concentrate it thoroughly in an appropriate and decisive manner. This is self-evident. However, if our people lack firm and unyielding courage, it will be impossible to realize thorough concentration. So-called concentration means focusing all attention on one point without regard for anything else. If other things are disregarded, those things that are not considered will naturally suffer great losses and harm. If the people are timid and easily shaken, the military cannot but be concerned. To enable our army and navy to implement the best strategic and tactical measures without hesitation, there must be people as solid as a rock behind them. This is what we should be aware of and remember today.</p>
<p>War Admits No Compromise</p>
<p>This war will definitely not have a compromising or eclectic ending. This has already been said repeatedly. Either we win or we perish. There is no other road besides these, and there is no other power to rely on besides ourselves. All my compatriots, no matter what, must not harbor false hopes. If we fail or surrender, we ourselves and our children and grandchildren will be forever plunged into an abyss of pain and humiliation. This point is even clearer from the enemy's public opinion. There is no room for doubt about this today. Thinking of this, what is there that we dare not do? What is there that we cannot endure? All we should do is this one thing. Simply chanting high-sounding slogans is definitely not true wisdom, let alone today is not the time to show off petty cleverness, but the time to "determination first, intelligence second," and fight together. This will surely unfold a bright road ahead of us.</p>
<p>Abandon Wishful Thinking</p>
<p>The enemy intends to carry out an amphibious landing operation on our homeland. Whether they do it or not is up to them. We only need to prepare according to what we believe.</p>
<p>According to the enemy's announcement, each soldier needs 16 tons of shipping for an amphibious landing operation. That is, landing 100,000 people requires 1.6 million tons, 500,000 people requires 8 million tons, and 1 million people requires 16 million tons.</p>
<p>How many of these ships alone will reach the coast of Japan? The Pacific Ocean is vast, and Japan's coastline is long. This vast sea is by no means a safe sea for them. This is something they also know. Torpedoes, mines, artillery shells, and bombs are all quite effective - effective when used by Japanese soldiers - and those Japanese soldiers who make them effective are rigorously trained - this is also something they should understand. However, there will always be ships that avoid being sunk. Transport ships that arrive full at our coast will disgorge their marines and soldiers. What will happen to those enemy marines and soldiers? We must not indulge in cheap or wishful thinking. Our country's survival is at stake here. The continuation of Japan's history of more than 2,600 years depends entirely on the actions of the Japanese soldiers and people who intercept the enemy troops.</p>
<p>The Patriotism of the Japanese People</p>
<p>About 20 years ago, the German scholar Emil Lederer was invited to Japan by the Tokyo Imperial University to teach economics. After his term expired and he returned to his country, he wrote a book about Japan. There was a section on the patriotism of the Japanese people, which I still remember today. He said: "Enemy soldiers may set foot on this country's land, but they will definitely not be able to leave this country alive." This is what the Japanese people firmly believe.</p>
<p>People know their appearance only in a mirror, and so do nations. A nation also often understands its true face only from the appearance of itself reflected in the eyes of other nations. Just as we see ourselves in a mirror and reflect on our hearts, nations often know how other countries see themselves and correct our hearts. Although Lederer's book is a thin booklet, it is a clear mirror reflecting ourselves for our compatriots. (Translated from the Yomiuri Hochi Shimbun, March 23)</p>
<p>War Chronicle</p>
<h3>Divine Tide Special Attack Corps</h3>
<p>#### Part 1: Kikusui Unit Battle Log</p>
<p>On November 12th of last year, the five valiant members of the Japanese midget submarine special attack unit, the Kikusui Unit, suddenly attacked Uroshi Atoll, launching a suicide attack and sinking two standard aircraft carriers and three battleships in one fell swoop. This great feat was a bolt from the blue for the enemy fleet, inflicting a tremendous blow. This was the result of the long-trained Japanese special midget submarines, a suicide attack with guaranteed sinking. Under the boiling hot blood of youth, shouting "Banzai" and hitting and sinking enemy ships, the great road to Japanese victory was opened.</p>
<p>The following is the battle log of the Kikusui Unit, confirmed by the submarine captain:</p>
<p>The enemy aircraft carrier seen in dreams is now waiting for our valiant warriors in Uroshi. On the tempestuous Pacific Ocean, swept by seasonal winds, we sailed towards the enemy stronghold - Uroshi Atoll. Enemy large aircraft patrols became stricter by the day.</p>
<p>Uroshi, 1,450 miles from our homeland, served as a forward repair base for enemy ships operating in the waters off Taiwan, the naval battle off the Philippines, and the waters east of Luzon, and was also a major base for the enemy fleet. Over a hundred enemy main force transport convoys were anchored within the atoll. At 11:00 AM on November 19th, Uroshi was faintly visible in the distance, with wisps of black smoke rising. At noon, the lush coconut groves of Uroshi Atoll were clearly visible. Under cloudy skies, aircraft carriers, battleships, and other ships were anchored. One Washington-class battleship was severely listing, and another was heavily damaged, with its cannons pointing to the sky, looking quite pitiful. The captain, looking at these battleships, had fire in his eyes, wishing he could sink them all at once, but as the time was not yet ripe, he could only silently pray for the success of the brave warriors.</p>
<p>At dusk, as if blessed by the heavens, the sea surface near Uroshi was as calm as oil. The enemy, never imagining that we would suddenly pay a visit, had all their ships brilliantly illuminated. The lights of signal lamps flickered on and off on the bridge, and the incandescent light from the welding work being done overnight reflected from the clouds onto the sea. What a city that never sleeps! At the same time, powerful searchlights ceaselessly swept the sea and sky.</p>
<p>Never Forgetting the Motherland in the Moment of Death</p>
<p>At 3:00 AM on the 20th, the time for the first attack was near. At this moment, the submarine captain couldn't help but think of Ensign Imanishi – that hearty fellow who was eager to see enemy ships. At the same time, he also thought of Lieutenant Fukuda, who shouted "Long live the Imperial Navy! Long live His Majesty the Great Marshal!" until the moment of his death, thinking of the prosperity of the motherland and going to his death with a smile. What a noble spirit! The valiant warriors of the midget submarine special attack unit set off with this spirit, leaving only the option of turning themselves and their boats into shells, charging straight towards the enemy ships and sinking them.</p>
<p>At 4:16 AM, a tremendous explosion was heard from that direction, and a pillar of fire soared into the sky, the red light illuminating the heavens, and black smoke billowing. The surprise attack was a success! This was the scene when Lieutenant Nishina's boat struck a standard aircraft carrier.</p>
<p>The captain, gripping the periscope, couldn't help but shed tears of both sorrow and joy. Then, Lieutenant Fukuda's boat hit a Washington-class battleship, and Ensign Imanishi's boat sank a standard aircraft carrier. Lieutenants Sato and Watanabe also successively sank battleships. Uroshi Atoll instantly turned into a living hell.</p>
<p>The anchored lights suddenly went out all at once, leaving only the blazing pillars of fire, reddening the clouds on the horizon. (Report from the on-site reporter) (Translated from the March 26th Asahi Shimbun)</p>
<p>#### Part 2: Kongo Unit Battle Log</p>
<p>"Minatogawa Kiyoshi reflects the light of the banners, martial exploits are illustrious, flowing for ten thousand generations, beautiful Kikusui Unit, precedes me to the enemy lines!" This is the lament left behind by the valiant warriors of the second midget submarine special attack unit, the Kongo Unit. These generous and tragic warriors charged into the enemy lines on January 12th, dying alongside the enemy. Following the Kikusui Unit, the valiant warriors of the Kongo Unit also held the determination of brave warriors who would never return, and once again attacked Rōshi Atoll. They attacked Palau Island's Kersol Strait, as well as Omiya Island's Apra Harbor, and even drove straight into Hollandia in New Guinea, carrying out special underwater attacks on the enemy's five major fleet bases. Since the attack by the Kikusui Unit, the enemy's vigilance has been extremely strict, almost airtight. However, the Kongo warriors broke through their defensive lines, sank anchored enemy ships, and completed a modern miracle. When the enemy harbor sirens wailed, and the enemy scurried about in confusion, these loyal and brave warriors for the country must have ascended to heaven with a smile, dying alongside the enemy. The following is the battle log of the Kongo Unit of the Divine Tide Special Attack Corps.</p>
<p>Successful Surprise Attack at Uroshi</p>
<p>Lieutenant Tosho raised his hand and paid his respects to the north, bidding farewell to the motherland for the last time. At this time, Lieutenant Kaga, Lieutenant Motoi, and Petty Officer Fukumoto, who were also participating in the surprise attack on Uroshi, stood upright and solemn. Afterwards, after an unknown number of days, two months after the Kikusui Unit completed its mission, the Divine Tide Special Attack Corps once again visited Tori Rōshi Atoll. On January 12th, amidst the sound of the enemy patrol boats' depth charges, Captain Kaga heard a large explosion at 5:57 AM, knowing that the surprise attack had succeeded. In order to confirm the results of the Kongo Unit, the submarine boldly approached Tori Rōshi. In the periscope, they saw three battleships, eight destroyers, and over fifty transport ships, but regrettably, no aircraft carriers.</p>
<p>The Japanese submarine scouting the battle results naturally took great pains, but on the 11th morning, it was still inevitably subjected to several depth charge attacks by enemy patrol boats. The captain's efforts were truly indescribable. If the enemy had discovered them beforehand, the Kongo Unit warriors' attack would have been impossible. At midnight, the submarine stealthily surfaced for a look, only to see the lights of northern Tori Rōshi flickering on and off, and discovered an island nearby with ships entering the harbor with three or four lights on. At this time, an enemy plane suddenly flew out from the island. To avoid being discovered, the submarine quickly submerged.</p>
<p>When the Kongo Unit warriors charged in, they initially heard the sound of patrol boats speeding by, and heard the sound of depth charge attacks in the distance. There were more than twenty of them. Intermingled with these sounds were enormous explosions, which must have been the successful attacks by the warriors. Before long, Tori Rōshi Island issued an air raid alert.</p>
<p>Salted tofu and vinegared rice balls were the "bento" for filling their stomachs during the attack. Lieutenant Kuzumi, Ensign Ito, and Chief Petty Officer Arimori were not excited at all. They calmly carried their required items as if it were just another day of training and launched their attack. Many large transport ships were anchored in Kersol Strait, so this attack was carried out following the Kikusui Unit. Petty Officer Arimori's success was at 5:20 AM, and Ensign Ito was slightly later, at 5:25 AM. Amid the resounding explosion, the brave warriors sacrificed their precious lives for their country. The submarine responsible for confirming the warriors' achievements heard a heavy echo underwater. It must have been a large transport ship that was sunk.</p>
<p>Suicide Attack on Omiya Island "Hey, don't go too fast and overshoot!" Lieutenant Kudo said to Lieutenant Ishikawa, Petty Officer Mori, and Petty Officer Saegusa. He was afraid that his colleagues who were following behind would overshoot the target, so he told them to hold back. Coincidentally, Petty Officer Mori and Petty Officer Saegusa were both graduates of the aviation preparatory training class and had transferred to the Navy. Their instructor had told them: "Even if you were going to fly planes, you can still be a special attack unit that is guaranteed to hit." Thus, these two brave warriors transformed from the "Kamikaze" of the skies to the "Divine Tide" of the water.</p>
<p>From the attacking boat, there was a mighty cry of "Banzai!" which stirred everyone's heartstrings. The warriors brought sweets, canned goods, and ice into the boat, preparing to have a big feast along the way. They were all as happy as children.</p>
<p>The submarine following to check the battle results discovered Omiya Island in the mist of the 11th. Enemy planes were flying in the sky, and merchant ships were sailing on the water. The scheduled attack time was approaching. The lights on Omiya Island were dim, and the suicide attack warriors were probably advancing towards Apra Harbor in the direction of the lights. The submarine captain originally intended to surface to observe their battle results, but he had to give up because enemy planes were constantly circling in the sky. At 5:34 AM on the morning of the 12th, he looked through the periscope and saw that thick clouds covered the sky and he couldn't see where the island was, but in the direction of Apra, black smoke was billowing into the sky, and embers were still burning, proving that the warriors' attack had been successful.</p>
<p>Hitting Enemy Ships in Hollandia</p>
<p>At that time, there was a strong transport convoy anchored in Hollandia’s Humboldt Bay. It was assumed that there were also aircraft carriers and battleships there. Lieutenant Kawabunbo, Lieutenant Hara, Master Sergeant Muramatsu, Petty Officer Sato, and other warriors had received the order "Do not insult a small enemy, do not fear a large enemy" when they departed, and were single-mindedly for the country, prepared to sink to the bottom of the sea with the enemy ships.</p>
<p>The voyage of the warriors who made a long expedition to New Guinea, far from the homeland, was very peaceful. The accompanying submarine, on January 10th, two days before the attack, also discovered an enemy patrol plane after sunset, and broke into Hollandia’s heavily guarded defense line.</p>
<p>The next day, the 11th, four enemy patrol boats appeared in the dawn, all with their lights on for identification by their allies. The future of the Kongo Unit's attack was difficult to be optimistic about. Near noon, a landing transport ship and two patrol boats were spotted through the periscope. At dusk, another patrol boat was spotted, and a torpedo boat passed by at midnight. After noon on the 12th, it was assumed that the warriors had already broken into the bay. Thinking about the large number of enemy patrol boats, the submarine captain and all the crew members sincerely prayed for the warriors' success. After some time, night fell on the sea again, and suddenly a large ship with lights on was seen sailing from afar. The submarine captain, in order to respond to the Kongo Unit warriors, also decided to carry out an attack, and ordered preparations to fire torpedoes. However, when the ship approached, after careful observation, it turned out to be a large hospital ship with two funnels, and its four red crosses could be clearly seen, so they had to give up. However, one thing could be certain from this was that since a hospital ship had entered the port, there must be large warships anchored there as well. Silently waiting in the darkness until 4:55 AM in the morning, a large area of flames was seen rising from the direction of Hollandia. The Kongo Unit's hit was confirmed. Before long, a great storm arose at sea, and the flames also disappeared within it.</p>
<p>That evening, the personnel on the submarine lined up on the ship and silently paid their respects to the warriors who had died for the country in the direction of Hollandia. Then, they sang the third verse of "Sinking" and cheered "Banzai" to celebrate the success of the Kongo Unit's suicide attack.

<h3>Map of Okinawa Island Situation</h3>
<p>The decisive battle for Okinawa Island is currently underway in Naha, Shuri, Gushikawa, Tsuken Island, Nakagusuku, Nago, as well as Aka Island, Zamami Island, Tokashiki Island, Mae Island, Kuro Island, and other islands of the Kerama Islands. The Japanese army is firmly defending its positions, inflicting heavy casualties on the attacking enemy. According to a Japanese Imperial Headquarters announcement, since March 23rd, the Japanese army has sunk and damaged as many as 415 enemy ships, causing the enemy's assault forces to fall into a state of chaos. The results achieved by the Japanese army are of great significance for the victory of future operations.</p>
<h3>Protecting Air Raid Shelters</h3>
<p>— Mamoruichi</p>
<p>Recently, the suburbs have once again been subjected to air raids, causing the work of digging air raid shelters in the city to become tense. In order to reduce the unnecessary sacrifice of life, digging air raid shelters is a matter of utmost urgency. Given the large population of this city, there must be a ditch every five steps and a shelter every ten steps to adequately meet the emergency needs of all city residents. However, if we take a stroll through the streets and examine the completed air raid shelters, we will feel dejected and wonder whether the air raid shelters have their true value during air raids? Can they adequately serve as a safe place for the citizens' lives? Although air raid shelters are not absolutely safe, are our citizens willing to seek refuge in air raid shelters during air raids? After the existing air raid shelters are completed, few pay attention to them or protect them again, causing some air raid shelters to form the following conditions:</p>
<p>Serving as a playground for naughty children, who run up and down, throw bricks and mud, causing the shelter to be filled with mud and rocks, and the shelter body to be damaged.</p>
<p>Serving as a place for beggars to hide and live, they live here, causing the shelter to be filled with rags and tattered mats, intertwined and crisscrossed. It is also regarded by citizens as a public latrine, causing foul odors to be overflowing, causing people to cover their noses.</p>
<p>After it rains, the low-lying air raid shelters are filled with dirty water. When the breeze rises, the turbid waves ripple, making people only recognize a pond and not a shelter.</p>
<p>With these conditions, once an air raid comes, how can citizens stand and hide in them? Some may think that one can't care about hygiene when seeking refuge, but it must be known that unhygienic conditions are definitely not a phenomenon that should exist in air raid shelters. Furthermore, as the weather gets hotter, if the dirt and turbid water are not cleaned, mosquitoes and flies will breed, then infectious diseases will definitely be on the rise. One more air raid shelter will inevitably be one more breeding ground for disease. So, those who protect the people are harming the people. Can this not be disheartening? Based on my limited knowledge, I propose two measures to protect air raid shelters, for the consideration of the municipal health and Baojia authorities.</p>
<p>Air raid shelters that are damaged or unclean should be repaired by the diggers, and the dirt, rocks, and garbage inside the embankment should be cleaned by the street sweepers. The Baojia personnel concerned should use the original fire extinguishing buckets to clear the turbid water, and then apply lime and yellow sand to make it dry quickly. When necessary, the Health Bureau should assist in disinfection.</p>
<p>The integrity of the air raid shelters should be taken care of by the Baojia personnel on duty, and no one should be allowed to enter and do anything that would damage the air raid shelters. In addition, warning notices should be erected or posted outside the shelters, strictly prohibiting unauthorized entry without cause. Furthermore, the police should conduct patrols at any time, and those who violate the rules should be arrested and punished.</p>
<p>The above two measures are not very high-minded, but are easy to implement. The relevant authorities should definitely do them well. Once the air raid shelters are not just temporary decorations, but are truly air raid shelters in name and in fact, then the citizens will be fortunate.</p>
<h3>Further Discussion on Improving Well Digging</h3>
<p>— Bao Zuqi</p>
<p>The eighth issue of the Shanghai Municipal Affairs Journal has "Improving Well Digging Virtue", which proposes "removing the well ring, paving it with cement to form a flat surface, opening holes of appropriate size to allow buckets to go up and down and to prevent children from falling down, and installing stone covers. If economically feasible, also install water pumps." I would like to provide the following opinions for research.</p>
<p>Removing the well ring is more dangerous. If a stone is forgotten, then slightly larger objects are more likely to fall down.</p>
<p>It may be impossible to meet the conditions of opening holes of appropriate size to allow buckets to go up and down and to prevent children from falling down, because the opening of the bucket is not smaller than the child's waist. Moreover, when drawing water, too small a well opening is inconvenient.</p>
<p>Installing water pumps is extremely expensive, which is probably unaffordable for the average person. Moreover, pumps are very easily damaged, which is quite troublesome, and it is also inconsistent with the principle of economy.</p>
<p>If a wooden fence about five or six feet high is installed around the well (the public well in Siwei Village near Taixing Road uses this method), children have no need to wash clothes or vegetables, and they are absolutely prohibited from entering, which can avoid the danger of children playing and falling in or pedestrians stumbling at night.</p>
<p>As for the well being easily damaged, building it firmly is essential, and the residents' love for public property is especially necessary.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Ningbo Junk Traffic</h3>
<p>— Liu Feng</p>
<p>Travel between Shanghai and Ningbo in eastern Zhejiang is difficult because steamships do not run on a regular schedule and tickets are difficult to purchase. Therefore, junk companies have emerged. In the past, these companies mostly engaged in freight transportation between Shanghai and Ningbo, and sometimes took passengers, but most of them were acquaintances and did not care about the fare. Recently, in order to meet the needs, they have publicly sold tickets for passengers. Based on the investigation, the details are as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai Junk Company - Located at No. 15 Xinjie Street, the Bund, it has four junks that run exclusively from Shanghai to Xiepu, Zhenhai. The route it takes is roughly the same as that of the large steamships, but it is closer to the coast. The departure point is the Guangxin Wharf in Yangshupu. Passengers take a small barge from the wharf and then board the junk. The barge fare is 500 yuan per person. The large junk is docked at buoy No. 26 or No. 27. After the passengers board the ship, the sails are raised and they take advantage of the receding tide to Wusong. After waiting for inspection by the water police, customs, and martial law ships in Wusong, they can go straight to Xiepu if there is a northeast wind, northwest wind, or north wind. In the best winds, it takes about sixteen to twenty hours to reach. The route it takes is: Wusong exit across Sange Water, the coast of Chongming Island, Woli Gangsha, Wai Gangsha, Liangshan to Zhenhai Port, Xiepu. Xiepu is a small town fifteen miles northeast of Zhenhai. It is a gathering place for fishermen and has inns and shops. There is a security brigade locally, and passengers must be inspected upon landing. The ticket for this route is 12,000 yuan per person. Half price for those under ten years old. Passengers must register in advance. Luggage up to 50 kilograms costs 1,500 yuan per piece. A luggage ticket must be purchased when purchasing a ticket in order to be transported onto the ship. No food is provided on the ship. You can bring your own dry food, or bring rice for the captain to cook. When disembarking, pay the captain 200-300 yuan for tea. Those who want to go to Ningbo can take a fast boat from Xiepu to Ningbo, which is forty li away. There are two trains a day, departing at 8:30 AM and 1:00 PM. The fare is 400 yuan. If you want to be comfortable, you can also take a private boat, which goes directly to the Jiangbei Bank of Ningbo. If you take the land route, you can go from Xiepu via Zhenhai to Ningbo, a total of about fifty li. There are no cars available now.</p>
<p>Minsheng Junk Shipping Company - There are three ticket offices: No. 685 Tiantong Road, No. 66 Father Jin Road, and Wanxing Wine Shop, Licangqiao Street, Nanshi. The ship is docked at the Guanhua Pier in Nanshi. Take advantage of the Pujiang River's receding tide to sail north to Wusong. Wait for the wind to exit. If the wind is not favorable, it will not depart. Pass Wai Tongsha, Dazhi Liangshan, Wuxingcang to Zhenhai Longshan. The fare for this route is 13,000 yuan. If you arrive early at Longshan, you don't need to stay overnight. If you arrive late, you have to stay overnight. Then take a fast boat from Longshan in the early morning via Waimen to Hetou City, about eight li away. Take a fast boat from Hetou City for four hours and forty-five li to Ningbo. The total cost of the route is 15,000 yuan. Small pieces of luggage can be carried for free. Large pieces cost an additional 2,000 yuan per piece. Currently, there is one train every other day. If there are many people, trains can be added every day. Passengers must purchase tickets in advance. As for the departure time, the company will send someone to notify them temporarily. Food must be prepared in advance, or you can bring rice for the captain to cook. Pay a tip for the wine when disembarking. There are inspections by the Zheng County security team, water police, and police near Ningbo. A fee of 500 to 1,000 yuan per person is required to avoid trouble.</p>
<p>Yimin Junk Company - Located at No. 22 Jiqun Guangli, Dongxin Bridge, the ship is docked at Guangxin Wharf in Yangshupu. It sails to Zhenhai. From Zhenhai, take a fast boat to Beibei. Purchase tickets in advance. The fare is 15,000 yuan. Half price for those under ten years old. The luggage limit is seven kilograms. The charge for each additional kilograms is 200 yuan. The fee for each large piece of luggage is 5,000 yuan. Passengers must provide their own meals along the way. The time of departure from Guangxin Wharf is determined by the time of the receding tide. It takes twenty hours with favorable winds to reach Zhenhai. You must give the captain a tip of less than 1,000 yuan when disembarking.</p>
<p>Jianrong Trading and Transportation Company - Located at No. 65A, Yongsheng Street, formerly Dongzilaihuo Street (intersection of Great Shanghai Road). The route is from the front door of the company at 8:00 AM, take a group bus (can accommodate 40 to 50 people) via Hongqiao, Beiqiao, and Luqiao to Minhang. Since there are no small steamships for transportation across the Nanhuangpu River there, the bus will end here. The whole journey is fifty li and takes about three hours. Take a fast boat from Minhang to Zhangjiajun, about sixty li away. It takes five to six hours. Take a sea boat that night and take advantage of the favorable wind to cross the Qiantang River and go straight to Linshanwei (Yao county). This sea route is 120 nautical miles. Upon arrival, passengers will automatically go to various places. Linshanwei to Yuyao county is about sixty li, Yuyao to Ningbo is about eighty li, and there are small steamships available. The company currently has two group buses and several civilian boats. However, the section from Minhang to Zhangjiajun could still use passenger cars, but now it uses fast boats. The bus departs every fifth and tenth of the month. Passengers must purchase tickets in advance. The total fare, including buses, fast boats, and sea boats, is 25,000 yuan and takes two days.</p>
<p>Dalian Shipping Company - Gao Nanshi Xiaobeimen Wanzhu Street No. 101, has four or five civilian boats. The larger ones can carry about a hundred passengers, and the smaller ones can carry forty to fifty people. They mainly sail in the area of ​​Andong, Yuyao, Shangyu, and Niajialu. There are several other companies that take the same route.</p>
<h3>Public Pawnshop Observations</h3>
<p>— Ren Zhe</p>
<p>The newspaper reported that the Municipal Government of this city, for the sake of considering the welfare of the common people, has established a public pawnshop, announced regulations, and is sponsored by the Social Welfare Bureau, stipulating a monthly interest of five cents, a deadline of six months, and a maximum of 5,000 yuan per transaction. I can't help but feel fortunate for the city's salary earners. Everyone knows that the current income of salary earners is not enough for ten days of expenses. They have to cut flesh to cover wounds and have no choice but to suffer the heavy exploitation of high-interest loans. In the past, the pawnshops of the Big Together Trade in this city charged one cent per month, plus one cent and five cents for storing the box once, with a deadline of four months, not exceeding five cents per month. When the pawnshops of the Small Together Trade raised the monthly interest to two cents, plus one cent and eight cents for storing the box, the interest was equal to three cents and five cents after one month. The Big Together Trade pawnshops then stopped serving waiting patrons and closed down. Since then, the livelihood of citizens has been dwindling day by day.</p>
<p>According to Min, there are only seventeen pawnshops of the Big Together Trade in this city (?), and there are more than seven hundred pawnshops of the Small Together Trade (?). We hope that the municipal authorities will renovate the existing facilities and manpower of the Big Together Trade to set up public pawnshops in order to respond to light work and familiarity, and it will be easier to implement. However, it may be difficult to make ends meet with only 20 million yuan of capital for each shop. It is best to ask the Reserve Bank to borrow a large sum of money according to the example of large loans for production projects, and lend it out on a monthly basis with an interest rate of one cent. Although its nature is to passively relieve the common people, the production projects and the industrial and commercial employees related to production projects—salary earners—can obtain assistance in their livelihood and be able to work with peace of mind, and it is still a positive way to assist production.</p>
<h3>Clean Up the Self-Defense Pavilion</h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>The perfection of the Baojia system and the strictness of the Baojia organization in this city have been enhanced and improved day by day after a considerable period of time and the joint efforts of the upper and lower levels. The height of the self-defense pavilion was originally the place for the self-defense team members to avoid wind and rain and to take shelter when on duty at night. However, recently, self-defense pavilions such as Ningxia Road are often occupied by street sweepers or beggars at night. The self-defense team members drive them away without cloud, and the weak teachers are insulted or turned around. Such nest-occupied magpies and small beams jumping are really not successful, not only tarnishing the appearance of the city, but also undermining the prestige of the Baojia and police. The Baojia authorities should pay attention to strictly ordering the self-defense team members to jointly inspect, and expel or detain them. After that, all the self-defense pavilions in the city should be fitted with a door and equipped with a door lock. Whoever is on duty and who is responsible, such as wearing a police baton and armband, should Dai Qing Xiaoxiao, and reforming the self-defense pavilion is an urgent matter. I hope the Baojia authorities will pay attention to it.</p>

<h3>The Road Home</h3>
<p>— Chuan Wo</p>
<p>One</p>
<p>I almost didn't recognize this childhood companion. Though he had grown quite tall, he appeared extremely haggard. The black eyes hidden beneath his thick eyebrows had lost the lively sparkle of years past, and a worldly smile hung upon his lips instead.</p>
<p>I clasped his hand tightly. Oh, how coarse his hand was! But as we shook, I inadvertently noticed that his arm was somewhat unnatural.</p>
<p>"Yes, I was injured by shrapnel!" he answered sadly when I asked him. Then, he told us the story.</p>
<p>"Five years ago in the spring, the countryside was very unsettled. After our house was burned down, I lived with my elderly grandmother in the dilapidated ancestral hall of the Li family. One night, there was intense gunfire outside, gradually moving closer to the dilapidated hall. My grandmother and I were so frightened that we lay on the ground. But immediately, a group of people burst in, and then bullets flew into the window. I only felt a sharp pain in my arm before losing consciousness and fainting. Later, it was my grandmother who tearfully pleaded with people, and finally, with the help of a few people from Tian Village, they managed to barely treat it. But eventually, I became a cripple. I could no longer help people farm, so I had to go to the Yesei Town every day to sell pancakes and fried dough sticks. How could I properly support my grandmother like this?... Until the beginning of last year, thanks to an introduction from a distant uncle, I came to Shanghai to work as an apprentice in a machine factory..."</p>
<p>I didn't even know he had been in Shanghai for over a year. Shanghai, said to be a place of easy development, might this unfortunate, orphaned child who had lost his parents and elder brother, and was also struck by gunfire, be able to find a little security in his fate from now on? Of course, life as a factory apprentice is arduous, but Heaven has given him this tall body and unyielding character. Can I not believe that he will be forged stronger through hardship?</p>
<p>As we routinely inquired about his grandmother's well-being, his face suddenly turned ashen. He told us in a tearful voice, "Grandmother has died of illness. I have to go back immediately. But..."</p>
<p>I felt a kind of solidified sorrow weighing down on my heart. Speaking of death, this elderly person over seventy years old couldn't be considered too early. However, after spending her middle age wretchedly, watching her sons and grandsons die one by one, in the end, she clutched desperately at this young grandson, living by begging from others. And when the little bit of light illuminating the corner of her bleak life was almost extinguished by cruel gunfire, how many days did she soak her tears in blood! Coming to Shanghai, she shed bitter old tears of sorrow that surpassed joy. Yes, what could she use to guarantee that she could meet her grandson again? Elderly people in this situation often love their children and grandchildren more than themselves. She would have been willing to live a few more days to see her grandson succeed!</p>
<p>I couldn't bear to imagine the sadness of the living. But what was he going to say after his "but"? I was concerned about his future life, I couldn't help but ask him.</p>
<p>"Once I go back this time, I won't be able to come back to the factory anymore." This voice was more painful than when he spoke of his grandmother's death.</p>
<p>"More than a month ago, I received news that my grandmother was ill. I asked the boss for leave to go back. At first, he firmly refused, saying, "These few days are when we're busiest, are you intentionally trying to sabotage my business?" Later, after repeated pleading and saying that my wages would be deducted for the days of leave, he finally agreed to let me go back for a week. It was good that my grandmother didn't die that time. I hurriedly came back. But now, my grandmother has actually died. How can I not go back again? When I told the boss this time, his tone was different. "You went away for less than a month and now you want to go again, you probably don't intend to work here anymore. Now I only have two things to say to you: if you want to go back, don't bother coming back; if you still want to work here, don't even think about going back!" I said, "My grandmother died, there's no way around it." "I'm only talking about practical matters with you now, whether your grandmother dies or not is none of my business!" I immediately insisted on leaving. He calculated my wages, but after deducting the travel expenses, I'm afraid there won't be much left..."</p>
<p>The sinful rice bowl has been broken, but abandoning this one, what is left? For a disabled young man with no one to rely on, how small this big world is! I remember: the mountains and rivers of my hometown are beautiful, the land of my hometown is vast; the soil contains treasures of life, wild grasses of abundance blow on the ridges, the fields of my hometown nurture millions of children, but also freeze and starve another group. The land has been occupied by a few people, rice and wheat and firewood are piled into the granaries of the wealthy; what's more, many mountains and fields have been leveled into wasteland, many villages have been destroyed into ruins. What can a person without land get from his hometown? Especially an honest person who is physically incomplete!</p>
<p>"This kind of boss is really unreasonable. This time you lost your job, it can't be blamed on you. Go back to the countryside and work hard, it should always be easy for a young man to support himself, right?" my father comforted him this way.</p>
<p>"Yes, that's what I think too, but when I think about not even having a piece of land or a house, I feel a bit daunted in my heart!"</p>
<p>In the end, he left silently and bewildered.</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>The early autumn evening breeze carried me back to my hometown.</p>
<p>Wandering about my long-separated home, I particularly missed Ying.</p>
<p>One cold morning, I met him.</p>
<p>I almost didn't recognize this friend I had seen five months before! He was wearing tattered clothes, with a large hole in his short trousers, embarrassingly exposing his thigh. His bare feet were red-black and cracked, and his thin, sallow face showed the abuse his body had suffered from life. New and old grief and bitterness accumulated in those eyes, and the dust of melancholy stained the jet-black pupils. Of course, the worldly smile on the corner of his mouth had also been replaced by tearless sorrow.</p>
<p>He had become even less talkative than before. Perhaps, deceptive words were originally unnecessary for him: he couldn't beg for pity from the strong, he couldn't intimidate the weak, and he was unwilling to seek help from relatives!</p>
<p>If I were a wealthy fellow villager of his, he certainly wouldn't have come to see me. Because I was his poor friend, and he understood my character, he unashamedly told me about his experiences in the past four or five months in an enthusiastic tone and clumsy language.</p>
<p>He began to live by raising a sickle and carrying a shoulder pole. But he didn't have his own mountain land, he could only look for ownerless wild land to cut firewood, and his right hand couldn't use the sickle. However, mountain land didn't have clear boundaries, and powerful people could forcibly claim wild land as their own. Thus, he had to run into the remote mountains at night. Unfortunately, he was seen by the hired hand of Zhang Shunye once. As a result, when he was laboriously carrying firewood towards the town in the light of the early morning, he was surrounded by a group of people. They said he was stealing firewood, detained him at Zhang Shunye's house, confiscated the load of firewood, and gave him a beating. Since then, everyone knew that he was a penniless destitute, so they guarded against him particularly. So he was hungry several times. Under the inhumane torment he had never experienced, he finally fell ill. He groaned in the dilapidated ancestral hall, and no one came to take care of him. Eventually, his sister found out and secretly came to see him when she had time, giving him a few liters of rice, but she was immediately found out by her mother-in-law, who scolded her severely. During the autumn harvest, he supported himself, wanting to do odd jobs for people, but no one wanted him because his right hand was inconvenient, he couldn't thresh rice, winnow rice, or shell rice. But finally, the Wang Genfa family was short-handed, so they asked him to herd cattle and carry water for them for a few days during the busy farming season, giving him a bowl of rice to eat.</p>
<p>Seeing that it was now the time when the new rice harvest was ending, Ying would lose his "temporary rice bowl" again, the road ahead was vague, how should he know how to walk...</p>
<p>"I regret that I refused the boss that time..." he ended his complaint like this, lowering his head powerlessly.</p>
<p>"When there's really no way, I'm going to leave my hometown. Let me die, I have no more worries." These were the words of lament when he and I parted, and they fell heavily in my heart.</p>
<p>Yes, people abandoned by sinful people may be able to do something truly glorious for humanity. I bless him that he will soon embark on a new road. And I believe: his steps will be forever firm, his eyes will be forever forward!</p>
<h3>Cigarette Butt Fire</h3>
<p>— Xia Ru</p>
<p>In the rainy alley at night, there is a spark of light,</p>
<p>Flickering dimly, struggling in the mud, a wisp of green smoke twisting, life is struggling.</p>
<p>The muddy smoke, the footprints of jumping shoes are blurred,</p>
<p>The night walker's feet are far away,</p>
<p>Leaving behind the loneliness of the late night.</p>
<p>Perhaps chewing on the shattering of dreams,</p>
<p>Even more the twilight's end. In the rainy alley at night, I</p>
<p>Tremble in contemplation, unafraid, there is a</p>
<p>Remaining cigarette butt fire upstairs.</p>
<h3>Little Cloud</h3>
<p>— Shang Zhu</p>
<p>"Last night, when the night was deep and quiet, a sudden surge of sorrow gripped me, for no reason, yet seemingly for many reasons. I even thought about destroying myself," Sima Ru said to his friend, on a day when the weather was too good to breed seeds of sorrow.</p>
<p>"I felt lonely, so I stopped working and started to think. The world felt very far away from me. What I want is not formal people, but the sympathy of people with feelings. I used to love loneliness, but last night I felt fear of loneliness. I was sad all night; today I still carry the lingering sadness."</p>
<p>Sima Ru looked up at the sky, surveying himself and the surrounding scenery bathed in the warm sunshine. The sun revealed the smile of spring, but Sima Ru had the sorrow of spring. Waiting for no response, he looked at his friend's blank face, blaming her in his heart for her naiveté, for not understanding the life of thought.</p>
<p>"I don't know how I conjured up this idea," he continued, as if speaking to himself. "It came as suddenly as an acute illness. I, so young, would be content with my short life. Thinking of killing myself."</p>
<p>"You probably encountered something unpleasant. Or love has abandoned you," his friend said.</p>
<p>"Love is the only thing in the hearts of vulgar people."</p>
<p>"Then, loneliness in friendship?"</p>
<p>"Right, maybe I'm sad about the lack of friendship."</p>
<p>"Or the loss of friendship?"</p>
<p>"Friendship will not be lost: I have long had its lack, but I was content, not realizing it. Once discovered, it is as empty as if it were lost. The feeling of emptiness is the source of loneliness."</p>
<p>Sima Ru said, sighing deeply. He looked into the distance, this empty ground, far, far away, without a single person in sight, the empty sky, far, far away, without a single cloud. But this was not a bright and satisfying feeling, emptiness filled his heart.</p>
<p>"You can cry a bit," his friend said.</p>
<p>"I want to cry, but how can I cry? I, I, I think of myself, and the tears won't come out. I am very sad, but a lonely person lets himself know his loneliness. A complacent person will not feel lonely."</p>
<p>"You insulted your friend."</p>
<p>"Why?" Sima Ru asked.</p>
<p>"You say in front of your friend that you lack friendship, aren't you ashamed?"</p>
<p>"What I hate is myself. My heart has never been lively, now I seem to need liveliness."</p>
<p>"Sima Ru, you speak too circuitously!" his friend shouted.</p>
<p>Sima Ru gave a wry smile, as if an unavoidable answer, as if representing the act of nodding. He leaned against a tree trunk that was not yet full and long, looking at the cloudless sky; he used to love to watch the changing clouds, to them, he made all kinds of boundless speculations, sometimes letting a fleeting cloud; carry the burden of his soul, his thoughts, his reminiscences flying far away. This was an interesting amusement. Now, Sima Ru hoped that a white thing would rise in the distance, carrying away his heart full of sorrow.</p>
<p>"What are you thinking?" his friend asked anxiously and happily, under the beauty of the spring sky.</p>
<p>Sima Ru responded, falling from the cloudless sky, he searched for support. On his friend's plump smiling face, her youthful vitality, Sima Ru found that white, frivolous cloud.</p>
<p>The little cloud carried away Sima Ru's sorrow.</p>
<p>"Why don't we let ourselves enjoy spring!" Sima Ru grabbed his friend's hand, skipping and jumping, and ran straight towards the empty wilderness; that distant place, that spring distant place, that distant spring! —Chapter of Spring—</p>
<h3>Husband and Wife</h3>
<p>— Yuan Ying</p>
<p>If you are happy, and can still have some free time under the heavy pressure of life's hardships, could I please ask you to sit down for a while, and let me finish telling you this ordinary story?</p>
<p>The protagonists of the story are a pair of university students, my friends. The man wore a mortarboard, — there is still a photo hanging in their room, taken at graduation. — The woman studied Western literature for two years, and could recite a bit of Shakespeare.</p>
<p>They got married last year.</p>
<p>Lao Xi, that guy who wore the mortarboard, relied on a relative, and luckily grabbed the job of a small clerk in an insurance company from a large group of partners who sighed at their diplomas. Although he initially studied education, knowing only about motivation, IQ, and Normal Curve, running into the insurance company seemed a bit incompatible, but people still envied him, just like Lao D, who expressed:</p>
<p>"Lao Xi is really promising, he has a way out as soon as he leaves school."</p>
<p>As for the other one, Miss Sun Lan, for the sake of marriage, she had no choice but to abandon Shakespeare and sixty-odd credits, to wash clothes, light a stove, and cook.</p>
<p>The old classmates all considered them a happy family, although some seemed to think it would be even better with a child or a violin, but let's not worry about that, there is no such thing as perfection in the world, is there?</p>
<p>However, Lao D ran over to tell me that this couple had quarreled.</p>
<p>"What's the big deal about quarreling?" I said, with worldly wisdom, "Household matters, nothing to be alarmed about."</p>
<p>"But this time it's quite serious." Lao D shook his head: "Sun Lan, in a fit of anger, stayed outside for three days without going home, leaving our education bachelor to worry anxiously at home, eating plain noodles for dinner."</p>
<p>"Why did they quarrel?"</p>
<p>"I don't quite understand, I heard there were some romantic entanglements."</p>
<p>"Romantic entanglements?" I was taken aback, "I don't believe it! Our education bachelor is a gentleman, upright and proper, he wouldn't."</p>
<p>"I'm not very sure either, this is just news from semi-official sources." Lao D smiled. So I decided to visit them once. That "happy family" was on a fake fourth floor, the roof was not high, you could touch the ceiling with a stretch of your hand. I was very familiar with this house, I was the one who accompanied Lao Xi to see the house for the first time, and after the owner of the house got married, I was also a frequent guest. To be honest, I could recite with my eyes closed who's landscape painting was hanging on the wall, what scattered small objects were placed on the windowsill, and what photos were pressed under the glass plate that was cracked into three pieces.</p>
<p>Lao Xi, the education bachelor, was lying on the bed. I came in, but he didn't get up.</p>
<p>"What's the trick? You're quarreling again for no reason." I sat down by the bed.</p>
<p>He sighed and shook his head. After a long time, he hummed a sentence:</p>
<p>"Lao Yuan! It's really meaningless to be a human being."</p>
<p>"Come on! Stop complaining." I stopped him: "What's the matter? We've been friends through thick and thin for five or six years, is there anything you can't say? I didn't come to hear you sigh."</p>
<p>He considered getting out of bed, took out half a pack of cigarettes, and gave me one.</p>
<p>"I heard from Lao D that there seems to be some romantic entanglements, is that right?" I took a puff of smoke, looking at him: "But, I know that Lao D likes to exaggerate deliberately, for fear that the world won't be chaotic. What exactly is it?"</p>
<p>The matter turned out to be very simple. There was a female colleague in Lao Xi's company, in the accounting department, Shanghainese call these Misses "vases". But as I said before, our education bachelor is a proper person, so of course he wouldn't be like others, taking people as real decorations in the writing room, and, to be honest, he did have such an ambition, to "educate" this Miss well.</p>
<p>Going back and forth, I don't know how it happened. One day, coming from the writing room, they — Lao Xi and that Miss — were seen by Sun Lan on the streetcar. That little girl who was familiar with Shakespeare had her share of strong emotions. As soon as she got home, she couldn't help but shed tears. She lay on the bed crying sadly, even ignoring Lao Xi when he came back.</p>
<p>The next day —</p>
<p>"The next day, she went out early." Lao Xi paused, then continued: "She went out early, without saying a word, and didn't come back."</p>
<p>"Do you know where she is?"</p>
<p>"Lao Xi said she's at Xiao Xu's house. I called her, and she didn't deny it."</p>
<p>"So what are you going to do?" I asked: "I can take a trip for you."</p>
<p>"I don't plan to do anything, I just want to explain. What needs to be said, I've told you in detail, whether you believe it or not is up to you, whether you tell her or not is also up to you."</p>
<p>I went to Xiao Xu's house.</p>
<p>"Coming to be a peacemaker for Lao Xi, right?" Xiao Xu opened the door for me.</p>
<p>"Just want to be a peace envoy." I smiled: "Is Sun Lan doing well these two days?"</p>
<p>"Good! — Complaining for a while, reminiscing about old dreams for a while, and then teary-eyed again."</p>
<p>I walked upstairs with Xiao Xu.</p>
<p>Sun Lan greeted me with a long tirade again.</p>
<p>"Miss, I just came from listening to a bellyful of complaints. I said, "Both of you seem to have a lot to say, all regretting, sighing, but why do you still want to quarrel?"</p>
<p>I didn't repeat what Lao Xi told me, it would be more interesting for Lao Xi to tell her these things himself later, right?</p>
<p>An hour later, I jumped onto a rickshaw with her. Xiao Xu saw us off, saying to me:</p>
<p>"If she runs out again in the future, I'll look for you, this peace envoy!"</p>
<p>Along the way, Sun Lan still couldn't express her bitterness, she kept recounting how Lao Xi always worked until eight or nine o'clock before coming back, making people wait anxiously for dinner, and how their finances were always tight. Once, in order to attend an old classmate's wedding banquet, she discussed with Lao Xi, planning to buy a pair of leather shoes, but Lao Xi only said:</p>
<p>"What time of year is this? What are you doing?"</p>
<p>"What he said is indeed not wrong." Sun Lan said to me: "But also appearance, what does he know every day to make the shirt bright and shiny, the suit pants pressed straight under the pillow?"</p>
<p>I should be surprised that in the year since their marriage, life has changed this Miss of Western Literature to this point.</p>
<p>"That's good." I thought: "It's good for her to be tempered a bit. A flower in a greenhouse cannot withstand wind and rain."</p>
<p>Arriving at the fake fourth floor where you could touch the ceiling with a stretch of your hand, Lao Xi was still lying on the bed, smoking. Smoke filled the room. I opened the window, letting the spring evening breeze in.</p>
<p>Sun Lan didn't say a word. — Just like her name, she was originally a quiet person. — As soon as she entered the door, she first sat blankly by the table for a while, finally rolled up her sleeves, bent down, planning to light the stove.</p>
<p>I looked at Lao Xi, he sat up.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry. Lan —" He walked behind her: "These days, for the sake of life, I haven't been taking care of you."</p>
<p>Sun Lan didn't answer, lowering her head, tears falling.</p>
<p>Should this be the time for me to say goodbye?</p>
<p>"Okay." Then she stood up to me: "Life comes first. Stop making those young master and young miss kinds of scene!"</p>
<p>"Aren't you going to stay for dinner?" Sun Lan raised her tear-streaked face.</p>
<p>"Don't be polite. I'll come again after the rain. Good night:" I bowed to the couple of young people.</p>
<p>The story ends here, I'm sorry if it disappoints you, the story is not pleasing at all, is it? It has no twists and turns, no beautiful descriptions. No, it doesn't even have a surprising ending. But, sir, I said before, don't blame the author, this was originally an ordinary story, an ordinary story.</p>
<h3>Dusk</h3>

<h3>Commentary on the First Two Matches of the Charity Basketball Game: Tonight, Hualian and Giant Clash</h3>
<p>The Nanshi International Relief Hospital and the Nanshi Baoli Hospital, in order to raise funds for the two hospitals, specially entrusted Zhang Huixiang, general manager of Hualian Pharmaceutical Factory, to organize three charity basketball games, held on the 10th, 12th, and 14th of this month at the fitness room of the Eight Immortals Bridge Youth Association. The first and second matches have already been played, and the last match will be held tonight.</p>
<p>According to these three matches, Hualian is solely responsible, and borrowed players from the Zhongbei Shantou team to compete against the Westerner Monroe and the Giant team. In this basketball season, which has already passed its peak, this grand gathering of Chinese and Western basketball stars is a feast for the eyes of fans. Here is a supplementary review of the previous two games and a discussion of tonight's battle.</p>
<h3>Monroe Team Lightly Defeats Hualian in the First Match</h3>
<p>The first act of the charity game was held on the 10th, with Hualian borrowing players from the Shantou team to form a mixed army against Monroe. As a result, Hualian unfortunately lost with a score of seventeen to thirty.</p>
<p>The reason why Monroe won was entirely due to their use of their height to follow up under the basket as a shortcut to scoring. The tall man Fu Weike was the main figure. On the Hualian side, they failed to pay attention to this. The guards were unable to use a guard with a good jump to stop him, so they were outmaneuvered, and their failure was justified. Speaking of Hualian, they hastily joined forces with the Shantou team, without careful study beforehand, and went on the court doing their own thing, so that it was all individual performances, with very little cooperation. On the other hand, the entire Monroe team were comrades belonging to one team. How can Hualian win? Therefore, to summarize this game, it was the expected result.</p>
<h3>After Half-Time, Careful Reorganization Leads to Hua Lian's Ultimate Victory</h3>
<p>The second match, held on the 12th, saw Shan Hua Lian once again borrow soldiers from Zhong Bei to bolster their strength and face Monaco. Before the game, there was an interlude: a contest between the "Fat Team" and the "Old-Timers." The Old-Timers were a newly emerging formidable team, managed by Shan Wang Zhongtao and Zhang Yunxiang. Their team members were limited to those 36 years of age or older, to better suit the "Old-Timer" moniker. The Fat Team was also a peculiar team, carefree and contented. Although their players were large and clumsy, their skills were deep, and their recent practice had been diligent, so their performance was improving steadily. The Old-Timers were also formidable warriors of the past. The two teams' competition emphasized entertainment over victory, with many humorous moments that fulfilled the original purpose of the match. In the end, the Fat Team won 26-20 due to their greater experience. Examining the Old-Timers, aside from Kong Guangyi and Yu Yuzi, Wang Zhongtao, Zhang Yunxiang, and Wang Shoufang were past their prime, but their skills remained. If these veterans had the opportunity to practice, they could still dominate in second-tier teams. One wonders if the Old-Timers would be interested in that.</p>
<p>Concerning Hua Lian's victory over Monaco in the second match, there was significant consideration beforehand. Having learned from their defeat in the first match, Zhang Yunxiang not only borrowed Ma Canxi from the Shan team but also borrowed Li Zhenzhong, Chen Xuechong, Zhuo Guorong, and Bao Songyuan from Zhong Bei. This ensured ample options for management. It was regrettable that Zhenzhong couldn't attend due to other commitments.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Hua Lian, blessed with abundant talent, narrowly won 25-24 by a single point. The key to Hua Lian's victory was their defense. Ma Canxi, Zhuo Guorong, and Bao Songyuan were excellent in their own ways, especially in rebounding. All three had mastered the timing of jumping and intercepting, preventing Monaco from following up rebounds and scoring, which proved decisive. Xu Jusheng and Zhang Liangxiong were the most successful scorers for Hua Lian and deserve recognition. However, in the final minutes, Jusheng wasted too many opportunities, and Liangxiong loosely guarded Botto, almost allowing Monaco to overtake them, demonstrating a lack of composure. Although Monaco lost, their increasingly spirited performance and ability to use their bench effectively to disrupt Hua Lian's morale, especially after their main player was penalized, were commendable.</p>
<h3>Tonight's Match Is Bound to Be Exciting</h3>
<p>Tonight marks the final match, with the same Hua Lian lineup from the second game facing the foreign giant, the Giant team. A women's match will be added before the main event. Let's briefly discuss both matches tonight.</p>
<h3>The Three Provinces Team and Yi Kang Team Are Evenly Matched</h3>
<p>The women's warm-up match will start at 7:30 PM, featuring a contest between the Three Provinces team and the Yi Kang team. Originally, there were plans to have the Green team participate, but their strength was too great, making it difficult to find a suitable opponent. Therefore, the Three Provinces team and Yi Kang team were invited.</p>
<p>The Three Provinces team is the league's runner-up. Since Chen Zuoliang became their coach, they have made rapid progress, especially in their defense. Chen Liuzhen's remarkable improvement deserves special mention. The Yi Kang team is a new force trained entirely by Wu Zibin. Their ability to follow rules and apply tactics is commendable. However, in my opinion, their inability to reach the pinnacle is due to their rigidity. Methods are fixed, but application requires adaptability. Players are not machines, so one cannot expect them to always perform as expected. If Yi Kang can be more flexible, they will achieve even greater things. As for the key to tonight's match, Deng Xiuchun of Three Provinces should avoid taking aimless shots that waste possession. Their forwards are skilled, so there are ways to attack. Defensively, they should avoid fouls, as Yi Kang's forwards often obstruct and dodge opponents, leading impatient players to commit unnecessary fouls. If they are cautious, Three Provinces can win. For Yi Kang to win, they need to be more lively. If so, they might win by five or six points. Overall, the two teams are closely matched, promising an exciting game.</p>
<h3>The Giants Are Cunning; How Will Hua Lian Handle Them?</h3>
<p>The Giants have been quiet for a long time, but their reputation is admired by fans. Zhang Yunxiang's efforts led to the Giants' willingness to participate, adding much to the charity event.</p>
<p>The Giants are stronger than Monaco, focusing on stability. Players like Kai Jie, Ning Luofu, Tao Bolinji, and the Sasi Jin brothers are intelligent and resourceful, employing various tactics to exploit weaknesses and maximize strengths.</p>
<h3>Hoping Li Zhenzhong Will Bravely Help Out</h3>
<p>Hua Lian will use the same lineup as the second match. Everyone hopes that Li Zhenzhong, who was absent last time, will be able to participate. Regardless of the outcome, his presence will make the game more exciting.</p>
<p>In my opinion, Hua Lian's ideal lineup would be Ma Canxi, Zhuo Guorong, and Bao Songyuan on defense, and Li Zhenzhong, Chen Xuechong, Zhang Jinxuan, Xu Jusheng, and Zhang Liangxiong on offense. With these eight players, the performance would be excellent, and the coach would have many options. Just imagine, with any two of these three defensive players, rebounding would be worry-free. How could the Giants handle that? With Zhenzhong's intelligence to assist from the front line and his height to follow up, the other players would have plenty of scoring opportunities, leading to success.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Zhang Yunxiang should work with Wang Zhongtao and Dai Changling to direct and strategize from the sidelines. I dare say Hua Lian would have a 70% chance of winning.</p>
<p>Tickets for tonight's game cost 2,000 yuan, which seems expensive, but all proceeds will be donated to charity, and the expenses will be borne by the Shan Hua Lian Pharmaceutical Factory. We admire Hua Lian's financial and physical contributions and hope enthusiastic fans will attend and support the good cause. (Xian)</p>

<h3>A Record of the Wedding of Yan Weiwen, Main Player of the Green Team</h3>
<p>— Mei Jie</p>
<p>I mentioned in the last issue that Miss Yan Weiwen, the main player of Shanghai's women's basketball champion team, the Green Team, was getting married. Yesterday, I received an invitation from Miss Yan and attended the wedding, which was held at the Garden Restaurant at 4:00 PM yesterday (the 13th).</p>
<p>I arrived around 4:00 PM. Upon entering, I was surrounded by unfamiliar men and women, and I felt quite awkward. Perhaps because I don't socialize much, I stood there for a couple of minutes until a young man who looked familiar came to greet me. I learned that he was a player from the Skeleton basketball team and a neighbor of Miss Yan. He invited me to sit down.</p>
<p>Members of the Green Team Arrive One After Another</p>
<p>First, I saw Li Yunzhi, Yang Wenjuan, and Xiang Yulin arrive in spring outfits as bright and colorful as the bride's. Soon after, I saw Qian Xucang, Xie Yiqin, and Wang Wanggan arrive, which eased my discomfort. Amidst Xucang's witty remarks, Wang Yinlan, Huang Mingyuan, Zhu Shimao, Liu Zhenbao, and Wang Weizhen arrived. It was said that Zhang Minzhi was filming on location and Huang Xingfen couldn't make it due to other commitments. I noticed that Rong Shulun was missing, and I inquired about her.</p>
<p>Miss Rong Serves as the General Manager</p>
<p>I was told that Miss Rong was in charge of coordinating with the Garden Restaurant. This was because Miss Rong had connections there. She was entrusted with the task and took care of every detail, busy arranging everything. She truly deserved the title of "General Manager." I also learned that she was upstairs helping the bride get ready, which was why she was not present.</p>
<p>The Wedding Ceremony Was Full of Sweetness</p>
<p>The wedding ceremony was simple and grand, but because the bride was smiling the whole time, especially on this joyous occasion, I never saw her stop smiling, her pearly white teeth always showing. The groom, Mr. Yuan, had a dark complexion and a standard physique. He looked like a young athlete. I learned that he was also a cheerful person. Therefore, during the wedding, all I saw was the couple smiling. Zhu Shifang said, "Weiwen has the nickname 'Sweet Girl,' so the groom should be called 'Sweet Boy.'" Indeed, the wedding ceremony was full of "sweetness."</p>
<p>Lin Kanghou Competes to See the Sweet Girl</p>
<p>Amidst the cheerful wedding laughter, I caught a glimpse of Lin Kanghou standing at the back, craning his neck to see the bride. Mr. Kang had a separate banquet upstairs and stopped by to see the "Sweet Girl."</p>
<p>Observations During Tea and Snacks</p>
<p>After the wedding ceremony, the guests surrounded the newlyweds and showered them with confetti as they went up the escalator. Then, tea and snacks were served. Xucang quietly slipped away. Zhu Yinlan also left without a word. I sat with the entire Green Team at one table, except for Liu Zhenbao, who was chatting with some old friends from the former Qiuxiu Women's Basketball Team, including Li Baoqiu (still with an athletic air), Li Wenbao (who seemed thinner), and Yang Feibi (who was more slender and charming than before). The Skeleton basketball team sat at the next table, as the bride's younger brother, Yan Jiliang, was also a member of that team.</p>
<p>Almost Mistook Him for Fan Qinggong</p>
<p>Yan Jiliang's features resembled Fan Qinggong of Hua Lian so much that when Mr. Yan, as the master of ceremonies, accompanied the bride down the aisle to the music, I almost mistook him for Fan Qinggong.</p>
<p>Next Wedding Banquet Should Be for Rong and Yang</p>
<p>While chatting, I mentioned that this year seemed to be the year for female athletes to get married: Huang Xingfen, Shi Ruijuan, Wu Zhenxiong, and Yan Weiwen today. Huang Daoyuan immediately reported that after Weiwen, it should be Shujun and Wenjuan. Rong and Yang looked embarrassed but silently acquiesced.</p>
<p>The Green Team Will Continue to Work Hard</p>
<p>The Green Team is the dominant force among women's teams. Because of the weddings, many people have speculated that the team might break up. However, at the banquet, they all said that they were determined to continue working hard and improve their skills. The team's manager, Wang Wanggan, promised to give each player a new jacket as encouragement. The entire team thanked Mr. Wang. Therefore, I hope that when the Green Team plays in the future, they will have new uniforms and improved skills to show the Shanghai basketball community.</p>

<h3>On Badminton (1)</h3>
<p>— Chang</p>
<p>The Appeal of Badminton</p>
<p>Many young people are used to playing soccer, basketball, and tennis, and they think of badminton as a game for women. They think that the light racket, the light shuttlecock, and the small court are not enough for vigorous young men to play. They think that even if they play it, they won't find it very interesting. So many young people look down on this game! But it is not appropriate to be dogmatic about things that one has not experienced. As the ancients said, "One does not know the difficulty without having experienced it." You have to experience it yourself to know whether it is difficult or not. Whether it is interesting or not also depends on how deep your experience is. For example, learning to swim. Beginners not only find it uninteresting but also feel a lot of discomfort. Water gets into your ears, making loud noises. Water gets into your eyes, making them sting. How difficult! What's so interesting about that? But to those who can swim, it is very interesting, the best kind of fun. Because when you jump into the water and dive deep down, you become like a fish, moving forward and backward, turning left and right, so free and at ease. In the glassy world, you can see all kinds of things. The most interesting thing is to meet your swimming buddies and look at each other's faces in the water, which become either long or short, fat or round, wide or large. Ah! It's really strange. How can friends who can't swim know about the pleasures of swimming, like "a fish in water"? How can people who have never played badminton know about the pleasures of badminton? If you have played badminton a few times, then you might be able to appreciate some of the fun of the game. The most interesting thing about badminton is to make your opponent run, and if they run but can't catch the shuttlecock, then you win a point. When you win a point, or win a game, you feel as happy, as rich, and as victorious as if you had won the lottery, made a fortune, or won a battle. If you win a point with a fierce attack, you can secretly enjoy the pleasure of triumph. If the opponent hits the shuttlecock very fiercely and dangerously, and you can save it from danger and hit it over the net, not only will the onlookers applaud and cheer, but your own happiness will be greater than winning gold or a beautiful woman. If a game has ended, no matter who wins or loses, you will be covered in sweat and out of breath. Resting at this time is like a worker resting under the shade of a tree after work, enjoying a cup of tea, which is as good as being king.</p>
<p>The Benefits of Badminton: Easy to Sweat</p>
<p>The most beneficial thing about playing badminton is that it is easy to sweat out toxins. Sweat is a necessary excretion from the body. Sweat is acidic, containing sodium, dihydrogen phosphate, and other substances, similar to urine. Sweat is smelly because it emits fatty acids from the body, which taste alkaline.</p>
<p>If sweat contains other substances and accumulates in the body, it will affect the kidneys, and you will feel uncomfortable immediately. Symptoms such as headaches, fever, and stuffy nose will appear, because the skin and kidneys are very closely related. More urine means less sweat, and more sweat means less urine.</p>
<h3>Snippets from the Sports Scene</h3>
<p>Song Qihou of the Fat Team is busy looking for a house because his current residence has been sold.</p>
<p>The Old-Timers hope that reporters and referees can also form a team to create a four-way round-robin league with the Fat Team, which would be very entertaining.</p>
<p>Li Zhenzhong seems to be neglecting basketball lately and often expresses discouragement, probably due to his own difficulties.</p>
<p>Mrs. Zhao Zhilin of Zhong Bei has a large alcohol tolerance, reportedly able to drink three jin of Shaoxing wine.</p>
<p>Liu Min of the United Overseas Bank is very enthusiastic about soccer. He organized the United Overseas Bank Cup, a small soccer tournament, in the morning and reportedly plans to hold a second cup tournament soon. (Shou)</p>
<h3>Veteran Soccer Players</h3>
<p>— Lao Niu</p>
<p>Twenty-six or twenty-seven years ago, soccer in Shanghai was only played in schools. The matches between St. John's University and Nanyang University were the most exciting, with crowds of 10,000 people at each game. The students from both schools organized cheering squads, singing school songs and victory songs, with gongs, drums, and firecrackers, which was a different kind of excitement compared to today's soccer matches. The forward for St. John's University was Shen Siliang, the current chairman of the Shanghai Football Association, whose shots were accurate. The defender was Yu Hengzhi, who was good at marking players, keeping a close eye on the opposing team, loyal, brave, and had endurance. He was known as "Old Niu" (Old Ox). After graduating, he worked as the manager of the Donghua team in his spare time for a long time before going to Qingdao. During the war, he traded in foreign stocks in Shanghai. Three years ago, he returned to Qingdao and is now running a store there, which is going well. (Yun · Leda Guan)</p>
<h3>Reasons for the Chinese Team's Failure in the International Cup Semifinals</h3>
<p>In the International Cup semifinals held at the rubber plantation last weekend, China played against Italy. The winner would not only gain the right to the finals but also have absolute confidence in their chances for the championship. After all, the other team in the finals was from Northern Europe, whose strength was no match for China and Italy.</p>
<p>The Chinese players were determined to win this match, but after fighting hard for ninety minutes, they were defeated 2-1 due to a lack of skill, losing the chance to compete for the International Cup. I still remember last year when Lai Donghua was at the height of his power, storming the enemy camp and winning the championship. This scene is still vivid in my mind. After only one season, the title was lost to foreigners. It makes me feel depressed to write about this.</p>
<p>Four Players Penalized</p>
<p>The main reason for China's defeat was the absence of Jia Youliang, Han Longhai, Li Yao, and Wu Qixiang, who were penalized. In the Chinese team, there were few players who could compare to Youliang and Li Yao on the left and right wings. Longhai's pace was unmatched in Shanghai, and Wu Qixiang was the best right-back in the city. The loss of these four key players was devastating, and this was the primary reason for China's defeat.</p>
<p>Poor Strategy</p>
<p>The second reason was the poor strategy. I have repeatedly criticized Song Lingsheng's attempt to pair him with Li Ning as defenders. Song is agile, while Li is slow, leading to inevitable gaps. This allowed the Italian team to attack on the right wing and score two goals. Since they were taking the risk of moving Song to the left, why not try Xin Fuji, who would have been more reliable? I still don't believe that the old Xin cannot be a forward, just as I don't understand why A Dai isn't playing forward.</p>
<p>Lack of Practice</p>
<p>Furthermore, Li Yichen was completely unable to perform, making it difficult for him to even move on the field. This was unexpected. I learned that Li was traveling between Shanghai and Chongming and didn't have time to practice, so we cannot blame him. However, this shows the importance of practice in soccer. One cannot rely on fame alone to win.</p>
<p>Although the Italian team won thanks to a penalty kick, they had improved in terms of tactics and endurance. Their forwards showed caution in their passes, and their use of breakthroughs was improving. Although they were not always successful, they posed a significant threat to China. I feel that the Italian forwards have unlimited potential if they can further improve their intelligence and passing skills and practice their shooting skills.</p>
<p>The Italian defense was truly like an impenetrable wall. Their players were tough and strong, and they each fulfilled their roles, making it difficult for the opposing team to attack. However, the Italian defense lacked creativity. If they could be tricked with skillful short passes, they could be attacked effectively. Unfortunately, the Chinese players were hastily assembled, a disjointed group. They had the will but lacked the strength.</p>
<p>Since China has been defeated, we can only watch as the championship falls into the hands of foreigners. We hope that next year, we can once again show our strength on the soccer field. (Jia)</p>
