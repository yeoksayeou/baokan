<h3>日陸海部隊緊密協力　呂宋島兩翼激戰　貝爾得島日守軍爲國效忠</h3>
<p>呂宋前綫八日中央社電　克拉克菲爾德地區之戰鬥日趨悽烈，日軍雖已斷絕通信連絡，然日陸海軍守備部隊緊密協力，士氣仍極旺盛，斷續奮戰中。敵軍因急於使用該機塲，乃將一切砲火集中於日軍陣地，反覆强行攻擊，施以砲擊轟炸，幷以戰車爲先導，運夜進攻，开用火焰放射器，黄燐發烟彈等，企將日軍陣地前方化爲火焰烟硝。又自五六百米之最近距離施以砲擊，毀壞日軍陣地，五日復出動戰車爲先導，集中砲擊日軍右翼，以戰車十數輛反覆攻擎日軍守備部隊，六日黎明，日軍以有力部隊實行肉搏攻擊，將其擊退。</p>
<p>菲島前綫八日中央社電　馬尼刺日軍據點前面之敵軍，出動約二師於前綫，展開攻擊，重點似在日軍陣地左翼安得保魯方面，該方面現正展開澈戰，敵之一部復於二日正午以戰車，裝甲事在拉克那湖北岸摩倫附近開始進攻，但被日軍擊退，予以重大損害，目下敵仍圖繼續進攻，該方面匪團蠢動頓呈活潑，六日敵軍在蒙達爾班附近日軍陣地前面構築攻擊點，經日軍攻擊粉碎，目下繼續攻擊，擴大戰果中。</p>
<p>菲島前綫八日中央社電　呂宋島巴打雁南方貝爾得島之日軍，於一月上旬敵軍登陸以來，孤軍奮戰，歷時二月，予敵重創後，日軍僅生存隊長以下四十七名，至三月二日晨發出電報稱，本島全體將士實行突擊，現恐巳悉數爲効忠。</p>
<h3>敵船滿載傷兵駛出仁牙因灣</h3>
<p>呂宋前綫基地八日中央社電　最近出入仁牙因灣之敵醫院船，甚爲頻繁，二月十日一萬五千噸級之醫院船一艘入港，三日內滿載傷病士兵，倉皇出港，而于三月二日復再入港，三日出港，四日復有另一醫院船入港，由此可見敵美因日軍之消耗戰術，反之處置傷病兵，而可推知美軍對日軍突擊之恐怖情形，在吾人想像以上。敵美幷强使菲島民衆對日作游擊戰，極力妨碍日軍突擊隊之出現，戰鬥時，以黑人兵爲盾牌，圖自身之安全，種種策略，無所不施，但日軍獨身突擊兵，突破一切障碍，繼續斬殺，由敵醫院船之出入頻繁及戰綫沿途十字架墓標之激增而觀之，足見日電戰果日漸擴大也。</p>
<p>里斯本八日中央社電　華盛頓來電稱，美陸軍軍醫總監諾爾曼柯克，七日發表美國傷兵激增情形如决：現在每日平均自海外戰域送返美本國傷兵，有一千二百名，二月中到達美本國傷兵，實達三萬五千之多，預想三月將增加四千名。去年十月美國陸軍醫院收容數爲八萬七千名，現激增至十四萬名。</p>
<h3>「拉伏爾决戰訓」　以一當百奪勇殺敵</h3>
<p>東京八日中央社電　伏爾日軍精銳守備部隊將士，已開設一百米之地下道，確立完密之自給自足態勢，嚴陣以待，準備應付敵人之倭寇，茲有日軍某參謀，駕駛最近在拉伏爾洞窟中製造之飛機，於十一日飛返國內，以便聯絡。該參謀將該地日軍將士之「拉伏爾決戰訓」介紹於國內民衆，該决戰調係於去年十二月八日大詔奉戴日，由該方面最高指揮官公布於全軍，茲介紹其內容如次：</p>
<p>「決戰訓」（一）必勝鍊武：必勝之信念，產生於必死的訓練，使以一常百的精神發揮無遺。帛琉島之奮戰，決非一旦可以訓練成功者，我全體將士應努力練武，涵養必殺必勝之實力，必須在作戰以前具有殺敵之決心。（二）將校之信條：將校是軍隊士氣之中心，必須時時在責任觀念下，以不後退的意志，完成百折不撓的任務，在慘烈之戰况中率先上陣，此爲將校的本來面目。必須時常以身作則，使其信念與氣魄貫注於部下，俾使部下均能達此志向。（三）下士官之信條：戰鬥日益熾烈，將校相繼喪失，則由下士官起而代之，指揮作戰，此爲戰塲之常則。帛琉島衝殺肉搏的戰果，亦得力於下士官担任指揮之少數兵力，凡存有下士官之軍隊，應起居中時抱將校之志，形成練武之中核，奠定必勝根基。（四）兵士之信條：兵士應以一當百殺敵，決不後退，如戰鬥激烈，喪失指揮官時，必須自任指揮奮戰。如武器損壞，子彈吿　，亦應赤手空拳，咬死敵軍。後退或被俘，恥辱較不忠不孝尤甚，果如此，則何以對安眠於靖國神社之戰友。（五）背水決戰之攻擊：通亦死退亦死，欲在死中求活，有必殺攻擊，全體將兵宜奮起前進，努力殺敵。（六）生死觀：貫澈生死者，爲盡忠之大精神，大楠公　忠至誠之鬥志，即七生報國之訓，我人應繼帛琉島殉國戰友之鬥志，以一當百，奮勇殺敵，使永遠感銘於國民胸中。</p>
<h3>造林委員會　開二次會議</h3>
<p>南京八日中央社電　首都造林運動臨時委員會，八日舉行第二次委員會議，由農林署長陳燕山報吿該會成立後工作情形，並通過下列各案：（二）議決本年度植樹典禮秩序單，（二）植樹典禮擬由陳君慧部長轉呈主席蒞臨主持，函請各院部主管長官參加。（三）擬具各機關團體代表，植樹評定成績之標準，並請植樹組負責評判優劣，十八日發表，十九日給獎。（四）關於本届紀念林所植樹苗，請陵園管理處就近保護，會議至五時許始散。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>裁員加薪問題</h3>
<p>最近本市各機關，各社團，及工商各業粉紛實行救員加薪，簡縮機構。裁汰人員，把省下來的經費，用作提高在職人員的待遇，使他們得渡最低度的生活，從而維持工作效率，這是各機關社團及各業，一面要支撑本身事業，一面却無力增加開支的現實環境下，不能避免的措置。關於救濟裁員後的失業問題，我們已於二月二十七日社評，略陳管見，現在想再就裁員加薪的執行上，提出一些意見，或可作各方的參考。</p>
<p>第一，目前裁員之風，不應作爲一部份人，尤其工商業的老闆方面乘機開除其所屬服務人員的藉口。有些老闆經理們於他們自已　肥之後，本來或正苦沒有機會踢開共久共患患難的伙伴，於是乘機下手，以爲可以不必再受社會制裁和道德制裁了，這實有糾正的必要。我們認爲現在資力仍相常雄厚，或並不如何虛竭的廠家和商家，不應也看樣裁員或裁得過多。政府當於仲裁裁員糾紛的時娛，務宜先行調查各該機構的實際力量，以求公平，而對於乘機濫裁者，非加以糾正不可。</p>
<p>第二，決定裁員之後，各常局尤其政府機構方面，於甄裁之際，須大公無私，絕不能祗憑主管者個人的喜怒和親疏及介紹人的來頭，作爲標準。應先裁撤不到差而拿乾薪，和僅坐辦公桌而閑空無事的冗員，其次則應輪到雖有事做但屬兼職而不能專心工作者，及能力較低者。至於任事勤謹，能力較强之人，則務須盡可能予以留任。這點雖屬老生常談，却是各當局應該再三注意的事。</p>
<p>第三，被裁人員自須給予適常的遣散費，並應依據平日辦公成績，或在職時間久暫，加給額外酬勞。額外酬勞可由各單位斟酌而定，遣散費一節，我們認爲最合理的，應包括薪水及各種津貼在內，或予從種種回鄉便利更好。至於提高留職人員的待遇問題，我們認爲不但要把被裁者所省下來的原薪，全部加給留職者，並且應盡可能把因人員減少而節省下來的種種消費，也充作加薪之用，另外如經濟情形許可，因再加薪而增多一些支出，也屬必要。</p>
<p>其次，被裁人員，應乘機作歸鄉之計，目前上海各業緊縮，已爲極普遍的必然現象，祗有裁員，沒有添人，所以，被裁人員擬仍在上海謀事，確是很困難的，與其坐吃山空，不如乘早疏散，不必逗留上海。同時，一家之中有婦孺眷屬者，更須全體離滬，早爲打算。</p>
<p>以上各點，希望各方於裁員之前多加考慮，實行裁員加薪之時，特別注意。</p>
<h3>京滬沿綫考察記之一　方問崑山縣政府　楊縣長秴覆治安等問題</h3>
<p>— 毅湯</p>
<p>目前政府施政的最大之癥結，在於人事上調動的頻繁，往往一個良好的計劃，因爲人事更迭而全部停頓，改弦更張。在此戰時，縣的地方政府因爲環境複雜，必鎖聽命的機關太多，應付的事情也太多，加以政費有限，人手不足，在手忙足亂之餘，想建樹什麽於人民有利的設施，誠爲非常困難的事。</p>
<p>崑山縣政府在人事一點上，要比鄰近的幾個縣好些，縣長楊永淸氏在任已經兩年多，所屬幹部人員多數是本址人，駕輕就熟，一切易於推動，如果不因爲戰時的特殊環境，相信楊縣長一定能比今日多一些建樹。</p>
<p>縣長答問　三月六日，記者抵達崑山的第二天，便去訪問縣府，承楊縣長接見，就以下幾個問題，一一解答。</p>
<p>（問）在上海疏散人口聲中，貴縣長有何高見？目前在崑山租賃房屋，有何困難？寺廟公產，可否借予上海移來的學校及慈善團體？</p>
<p>（答）本人對上海疏散人口，覺得非常需要，尤其因爲上海物資缺乏，所以很同情。不過崑山空屋有限，恐怕不能容納多數的移民。就目前來竊，崑山的地位也相當重要，所有寺廟公產和一部份好些的民房最近已被徵用，因此對於供給上海慈善團體等的居住，事實上有所困難。</p>
<p>（問）貴縣城內及四鄉的治安情形如何？收購米糧成績怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）崑山過去尙屬安定，最近因爲「新四軍」「忠救軍」到的很多，治安稍形惡化，城裏當然仍極平靖，鄉下則難說了。關於米糧收買，因去年本縣是荒年，所以成績不很好。</p>
<p>（問）貴縣財政狀况如何？公務員及保安隊之待遇如何？</p>
<p>（答）本縣財政是按照省府頒佈辦法的，沒有什麼特殊之點，目前全國的公務員，待遇都十分微薄（言至此顧左右微笑），但是保安隊士兵方面，情形好得多，每名每月要發三斗米。</p>
<p>楊縣長昨晚才從鄉下開會回來，今天又等着到旁的地方去，因此談話至此爲止。承介紹保甲室負責人之一——周世章氏，就該縣人口之分佈，數額及職業方面，一一解答如次：</p>
<p>人口壯丁　崑山轄十一個區，五十三個鄉，二十五個鎭，五六四個保，六一二三個甲，六七五四二戶，三〇九·八四八人。——這是最近的二月份的統計。</p>
<p>値得注意的是三十一萬不到的總人口中，男性爲一五九·一一九人，女性佔一五〇·七二九人，女性要比男性少九千人之譜，因此發生不數分配的現象，十六個人中要有一個無妻的男人，據記者所知，崑山婚齡的女性，在下層社會中偶有賣買的現象，其價格大約等於十石米，或一條牛，然而也視年齡大小面貌妍醜，價格有些上落。在崑山因爲格於鄉風，正式婚嫁的費用很大，買妻的人家雖說須支出一個整數，實際上還較便宜，道值是一個嚴重的社會問題。</p>
<p>第二點値得注意的是三十一萬人中，自二十一歲至四十五歲的壯丁數爲五四·〇〇五人，佔總人口六分之一弱，佔男性人數三分之一强，可見崑山從事生產者的比數相當大。實則在鄉間，婦女老弱也在田間工作，因此農村中如果不因爲屢屢的捐稅，以及不可抗的天災，應該非常富裕。</p>
<p>職業分佈　就該縣戶口之職業分配來觀察，以農家人數最多，商戶次之，工戶又次之，勞働者及船戶再次之。根據本年一月份的調查，其分配如次：</p>
<p>聯業別　人口數</p>
<p>農戶　一八六·八二四</p>
<p>商戶　六五·八八七</p>
<p>工戶　一九·九三九</p>
<p>勞働者　一九·一一四</p>
<p>船戶　一〇·四九五</p>
<p>公務員　五·四四一</p>
<p>自由職業　三·二六〇</p>
<p>寺廟僧尼　四九八</p>
<p>（附註：勞働者大約指挑夫車天苦力等不屬於工廠而無一定工作地點之出賣勞力者言。）　由上表觀察，農業人口幾佔總數三分之二，工戶勞動者及船戶（一部份爲漁戶）共佔總人口八分之一，非生產的商戶·公務員。自由職業者及僧尼佔總人口四分之一。</p>
<p>再從最近三個月之統計觀察，可以看出該縣人口移動的趨向。去年十二月該縣人口總數爲三一〇·一八四，本年一月爲三一一·四五八，本年二月爲三〇九·八四八。三月來最高最低間的差別僅一六一〇人，數目很小。人口流動性較低，這是農業社會與工業社會的不同處。</p>
<p>文化其他　在經費如此緊縮，紙張等費用如此高昂之際，該縣保甲室的統計工作能繼續不替，其精神至足稱道，希望該縣能將今後的材料，絡續供給本報，以與其他各縣比較，供給一般研究社會問題者之參考。</p>
<p>根據保甲方面的統計，曾讀書三年的壯丁，全縣不過二五·〇六六人，佔總人口十二分之一。這個比率較之偏遠省份，自然還算高，比之都市，還很落後，全縣小學倒有幾隻，收費不高，不過二千元左右，中學僅有一所。社會敎育極不發達，縣辦的圖書館，是供給縣民精神食糧的唯一機關，書籍也很貧乏。當地出版的小型報，銷路平常，滬報則供不應求，欲購無從。</p>
<p>由於文化的落後，迷信·賭博之風甚盛，鄉人以祈讓來治病，茶館以擺賭爲主要營業，凡此，都是敎育不普及的象徵。（三月六日自崑山發）</p>
<h3>紀念汪故主席　設置紀念堂　中政會議中提出報告</h3>

<h3>鄂省長葉蓬　談募款賑災</h3>
<p>南京入日中央社電　新任湖北省省長葉蓬，爲救濟武漢災民，特赴滬籌募賑款，業已籌得的款，定於近期內即啓程履新。記者訪葉氏，承發表簡要談話如下：「余此次於武漢遭受嚴重空災之後，奉命長鄂，故受命後，即先行赴滬籌集賑款，蒙滬上同鄉諸公熱心贊助，至本月底可籌集的款五六千萬元，更在救災工作其他之繼續籌款。又武漢市泰一半已成瓦礫，連日更進行淡口市復興計劃，並擬作復興借款之進行。至於如何施政。對民衆有利者則興之，於民衆有害者則除之而已。又如地方治安不克恢復，即無政治之可言，故必先努力剿除匪共，綏靖地方，使民衆得安居樂業，以爲當務之急」。</p>
<h3>行政訓練所學員　謁陳代主席聆訓</h3>
<p>南京八日中央社電　行政院普通行政人員訓練所，以學科訓練行將終了，不久即須分發學員赴各省市實習，八日上午十時，由該所沈兼所長爾喬率領全體學員列隊恭謁陳代主席致敬，當蒙親賜訓話，略謂：此次政府對於高級及格人員，再加訓練，係爲充實行政人員學力，提高行政效率，以期整飭仕述，澄淸吏治，幷對於學員畢業後，視其能力儘量任用，以資人盡其才，希望各學員對於地方行政之興革，深加硏究，以副政府之股望，各學員恭聆之下，極感振奮。</p>
<h3>德防守戰成功　克復勞本城　蘇軍向柏林開始總攻</h3>
<p>柏林八日中央社電　海通社訊：蘇軍於極猛烈砲擊後，已開始向柏林總攻擊。蘇軍最先之目的，爲佔領可爲此後進攻之基地及突破庫斯特林之要塞。過去數日間東綫之戰，德軍完全獲防守上之勝利，勞本城已爲德軍克復，波默拉尼亞之戰依然熾烈，蘇軍之目的爲抵達波羅的海沿岸及包圍大部德軍。</p>
<p>柏林八日中央社電　海通社訊：蘇軍顯欲進攻奧得河下流，復向期德丁·納哈夫附近猛攻，蘇軍步兵向阿爾特丹推進，略有進展，格萊芬堡·錫維爾本區域之德軍且戰且退，未被擊潰。蘇軍猛攻期德丁·納哈夫·龍梅爾斯堡以來，戰局無變化，但蘇軍屢次進攻勃托以南，蘇軍在海特附近進攻，迄無進展。東普勢士方面，蘇軍自新坦區械猛攻，亦未獲逞。尼斯河與奧得河戰事，僅係次要性質，蘇軍猛攻庫斯特林，迄未獲逞，庫斯特林與克羅森間戰况激烈。</p>

<h3>萊因河橋炸斷　西岩劇戰中　美軍突入阿爾夫他市</h3>
<p>柏林八日中央社電　海通社訊：過去二十四小時，敵軍集中攻擊威塞爾及科隆之德軍橋頭堡，在該二處美軍均用主力軍作戰，其目的欲殲滅萊因河西岸之德軍。在威塞爾德軍以傘兵作戰，英加軍佔領之阿爾本，已由德軍克復，英損失坦克車十八輛，來恩堡之鐵道亦有劇戰。昨日美軍十次進攻科隆德軍橋頭堡，美一〇四師損失尤重，美第三軍向柯欽及摩塞爾推進，並不斷攻擎德軍側翼，美軍數隊已被團殲。</p>
<p>柏林八日中央社電　海通社訊：美軍坦克車先鋒隊，自科隆城市區進抵萊因河前，萊因河橋樑，已被德軍工兵炸斷。又據負責方面稱：反軸心軍於二月二十三日，在羅爾河與萊因河間發動大攻勢後，已損失坦克車七百餘輛。</p>

<h3>墨索裏尼呼籲　對德軍協力</h3>
<p>柏林八日中央社電　墨義里尼首揆六日對義國北部之布里西亞法西共和國國防義勇軍訓話，希望與德軍誠摯全面協力，，略述如左：吾人勿忘德·義兩國之同一命運與使命，一九四三年七月之政變，乃爲一種陰謀，若義軍參謀本部準備完善，則余今日將不在布里西亞，而在開羅廣塲演說，吾人決防衛每一都市，每一家室。諸君對德軍之協力，須要盡最大之努力，吾人忖端在同生共死之立場，因此次戰爭，於德國是爲生命之鬥爭，故敵人不能滅亡之，德國軍民已一致奮起作英勇之防衛祖國。</p>
<h3>德國外長發表談話</h3>
<p>里斯本八日中央社電　紐約泰晤士報六日載一由柏林歸國之瑞典記者談話構：德外長里賓特羅甫，前週招待各小國外交官及瑞典記者三名晨餐，首先言明德軍始終死守來因河戰綫，渠稱：倘德國被擊滅，則吾人至少有選擇應被何國擊滅之權利，並將德國委議該國，目前情勢雖極危急，但尙無悲觀必要，反軸心空軍極力破壞來因至柏林間之一切建築物，但此種焦土戰術反防礙反軸心軍之進擊也。</p>
<h3>舊金山會議　蔣不出席</h3>
<p>里斯本七日中央社電　五日華盛頓明星報揭載蔣介石氏將出席舊金山會議消息，但渝使館當局否認，謂蔣介石氏出席事並無此種事實，關於出席之渝代表人選，尙未接到任何通吿。</p>

<h3>日軍軍紀嚴正　希勿輕信謠言　日軍憲兵隊本部發表談話</h3>
<p>近代作戰亦可謂思想謀略戰，即如大東亞戰爭亦然，在思想戰上不能獲勝，則作戰前途，難期勝利。上海日軍憲兵隊本部鹽於最近敵方積極出以謀略手段，有一部份惡劣份子，散放毫無根據之流言，以惑人心，特於昨日發表談話，力言當局對此類流言，決心加以粉碎。茲誌憲兵隊本部談話如次：</p>
<p>近來有頗多市民受敵方虛偽宣傳之惑，嚮壁虛構謠豚，誹謗日軍將士，實深表遺憾。尤如日軍將士對華人婦女有猥褻行爲或互相通信等，各種流言不一而足，然在日軍將士中，決無一人有此種行爲者，蓋日軍軍紀素極嚴正，萬一有犯軍紀風紀者，定必軍法嚴處，此爲衆所週知之事實，然敵方爲企圖誹謗日軍，時常濫造謠言，使民衆誤解日軍，此爲敵方之一貫作風，對於散放謠言，經詳細調查亦全無根據，純屬敵方虛構，將來如發現受敵方策略利用，口頭流布此類謠言，則視其爲故意侮辱日軍，決予嚴厲懲處，並望市民於聽到此類流言時，立即將詳細事實報告憲兵隊</p>

<p>局地訓練　本次局部防空總配置訓練由老閘新成兩分局轄境以內舉行，以南京路及靜安寺路爲界綫，分南北兩區，預定北區自上午十時起，南區自下午四時止，各在兩小時內將保以下之小區域（防空管區內之團）定爲單位，使所有家庭及全體居民同時實施訓練。此次局部訓練係以發揚一般民衆防空意志及舉行實地訓練爲最大目標。</p>
<p>上午十時訓練空襲警報發令後，實行全市區交通管制，車輛行人一槪禁止通行，約過廿分鐘，即可恢復車輛以外之交通。</p>
<p>待避訓練　不參加局部總配置各方局所轄地區，應於下午四時訓練空襲警報發令時，假想敵機大隊前來遍地轟炸，連續一小時內，全市徹底施行待避訓練，由警保防空指導人員，將待避要旨，曉示民衆，對惡意拒絕協力者，採取行政檢束。</p>
<p>燈火管制　由下午七時訓練警戒警報發令時起至下午八時四十五分解除時止，共一時零四十五分，届時各分報燈火管制班，凡有違反該管制辦法者，應嚴行檢舉，於翌日具報，予以查封處分。</p>
<p>警報傳達　警報之傳達訓練，頗爲重要，蓋將來遇情形非常惡劣時，鳴放警報汽笛或將感困難，警報傳達方法之適當與否，對於減少災害一點，關係至鉅，故此次各警報發令及解除時，應將預告之時間想像作爲實際之警報，並以各警分局爲主體，組織警報傳達班及警報受領所等，考查紀錄，俾有所糾正。</p>

<h3>黑帽子毆斃少婦　行兇出事經過　北站警分局長發表詳情</h3>
<p>關於華中鐵道公司上海站案內掛蔣士彥兇毆同事華中鐵道警務部愛路課女職員徐佩文，傷重致死一案，因外界不明此案內情，北站分局劉局長，特於昨（八）日就該案經過，對中央社記者發表公開談話，茲誌如次：</p>
<p>華鐵女事務員　此案發生於本月四日早晨七時相近，被害人姓徐名佩文，女性，無錫人，年二十五歲，爲現任華鐵警務部愛路課女事務員，兇手爲華鐵案內掛丙組副班長，名蔣士彥，鹽城人，年二十五歲，被害者丈夫名許森，過去在一年前，亦爲華鐵職員，任草掌手之職。此案發生，緣於是日早晨被害人及其丈夫等因事返鎭江原籍，因購票列隊時不遵秩序，被兇手蔣某鞭打，互相口角。</p>
<p>踢作腹部要害　旋蔣某將該女挾至案內掛辦事處實行非法責打，用足踢傷徐女腹部等要害，後由華鐵案內掛正班長李憶萱及職員張鴻生（與死者有友誼關係）趕到勸解，共同商議，由死者丈夫許森陪同傷者到張鴻生家中休養。時許森以爲彼妻受傷不重，故未報警，待至到達張家後，傷者連聲呼號胸腹內部疼痛，始由李憶萱會同許森送傷者人虹口靶子路一七一號上海療養醫院求治，經該院陳醫師診斷傷勢嚴重，左腎裂爲兩塊，腹背部內出血甚劇，性命堪危，照章立即通知虹口分局。</p>
<p>兇手已有綫索　由該分局轉告該管出事地點管轄之北站分局，時已間隔出事時間後達四小時，本人接到通知後，立即飭派幹探高承業等往北站逮捕捕兇手，但兇手已經逃逸無從，當將有關嫌疑犯多逮捕到局偵查，並嚴飭追捕逃犯在案。又當華鐵案內掛正班長李憶葳陪同傷者到醫院，經醫師證明傷危後，曾離開醫院四十分鐘，彼顯有教唆兇手逃逸之嫌疑，故本分局業將彼逮捕從事偵查，一面搜集各種憑證定日內拘途地方檢察署，依法起訴外，關於主犯經承辦探員等，竭力偵查後，業有相當綫索，不日當可破案。</p>
<p>又查該案發生迄今，已歷數日，而華鐵當局，始終保持緘默，深令各界表示遺憾。</p>

<h3>Close Cooperation Between Japanese Army and Navy Units; Fierce Battles on Both Wings of Luzon Island; Japanese Defenders on Batan Island Loyal to Their Country</h3>
<p>Luzon Front, 8th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The battle in the Clark Field area is becoming increasingly fierce. Although communication has been cut off for the Japanese forces, the army and navy defending units are working closely together, and their morale remains extremely high as they fight on intermittently. The enemy, eager to use the airfield, is concentrating all its artillery fire on the Japanese positions, launching repeated attacks, bombarding and shelling, and using tanks as a vanguard to advance at night. They are also employing flame throwers and white phosphorus smoke bombs, attempting to turn the area in front of the Japanese positions into a sea of flames and smoke. Furthermore, they are shelling from a distance of only 500 to 600 meters, destroying the Japanese positions. On the 5th, they again deployed tanks as a vanguard, concentrating artillery fire on the Japanese right flank, and repeatedly attacking the Japanese defending units with a dozen tanks. At dawn on the 6th, the Japanese launched a vigorous counterattack, repelling them.</p>
<p>Philippine Front, 8th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The enemy forces in front of the Japanese strongholds in Manila have deployed approximately two divisions on the front lines, launching an attack. The focus appears to be on the Japanese left flank in the Antipolo area, where fierce fighting is currently underway. A portion of the enemy also began an offensive on the 2nd at noon with tanks and armored vehicles near Morong on the north shore of Laguna de Bay, but was repelled by the Japanese and suffered heavy losses. The enemy is still attempting to continue the offensive, and bandit groups in the area are becoming increasingly active. On the 6th, enemy forces constructed attack points in front of the Japanese positions near Montalban, which were shattered by the Japanese attack. The Japanese are currently continuing the attack and expanding their gains.</p>
<p>Philippine Front, 8th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Japanese forces on Batan Island, south of Luzon, have been fighting alone since the enemy landed in early January. After two months of fierce fighting and inflicting heavy losses on the enemy, only 47 Japanese soldiers, including the commander, remained alive. On the morning of March 2nd, they sent a telegram stating that all the soldiers on the island were carrying out a final assault, and it is now feared that they have all died for their country.</p>
<h3>Enemy Ships Laden with Wounded Soldiers Sail Out of Lingayen Gulf</h3>
<p>Luzon Front Base, 8th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Enemy hospital ships entering and leaving Lingayen Gulf have been very frequent recently. A 15,000-ton hospital ship entered the port on February 10th and hurriedly left the port within three days, fully loaded with wounded and sick soldiers. It re-entered the port on March 2nd and left on the 3rd. Another hospital ship entered the port on the 4th. From this, it can be seen that the enemy is overwhelmed by the Japanese war of attrition and is struggling to care for the wounded and sick. It can also be inferred that the American troops are experiencing a terror of Japanese attacks beyond our imagination. The enemy is also forcibly using Filipino civilians to wage guerrilla warfare against the Japanese, making every effort to obstruct the appearance of Japanese assault troops. During battles, they use black soldiers as shields to ensure their own safety, employing all kinds of tactics. However, Japanese solo assault soldiers break through all obstacles and continue to slay. Judging by the frequent entry and exit of enemy hospital ships and the sharp increase in cross-marked graves along the front lines, it is evident that the results of the Japanese war effort are gradually expanding.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 8th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – A dispatch from Washington reports that U.S. Army Surgeon General Norman Kirk announced on the 7th the alarming increase in American casualties as follows: Currently, an average of 1,200 wounded soldiers are being sent back to the U.S. mainland from overseas battlefields every day. In February, the number of wounded soldiers arriving in the U.S. mainland reached as many as 35,000, and it is expected that this will increase by 4,000 in March. Last October, U.S. Army hospitals accommodated 87,000 patients, which has now surged to 140,000.</p>
<h3>"The Rabaul Decisive Battle Instructions": One Against a Hundred, Fight Courageously and Kill the Enemy</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The soldiers of the elite Japanese garrison in Rabaul have constructed a 100-meter underground tunnel and established a perfect self-sufficient state, awaiting the enemy's arrival. A certain Japanese staff officer flew back to the country on the 11th in an aircraft recently manufactured in the Rabaul cave to make contact. The staff officer introduced the "Rabaul Decisive Battle Instructions" of the Japanese soldiers in that area to the domestic population. The instructions were promulgated to the entire army by the highest commander in the area on December 8th of last year, the day of the Great Edict's Proclamation. An introduction of its content is as follows:</p>
<p>"Decisive Battle Instructions" (1) Inevitable Victory Through Vigorous Training: The belief in inevitable victory arises from mortal training, making the spirit of one against a hundred manifest without reservation. The fierce battle on Palau Island was by no means something that could be achieved through training in a single day. All our soldiers should strive to practice martial arts and cultivate the ability to surely kill and surely win. They must have the determination to kill the enemy before the battle. (2) The Creed of Officers: Officers are the center of the morale of the army. They must always fulfill their unshakable mission with a sense of responsibility and an unwillingness to retreat. They must take the lead in the most brutal battles, as this is the true face of an officer. They must always lead by example, infusing their beliefs and spirit into their subordinates, so that their subordinates can achieve this ambition. (3) The Creed of Non-Commissioned Officers: As battles become increasingly fierce, officers will be lost one after another. Then, non-commissioned officers must rise up and take their place, commanding the battle. This is the norm on the battlefield. The achievements of the Palau Island charge and melee combat were also due to the non-commissioned officers leading a small number of troops to command. All armies with non-commissioned officers should always hold the ambition of an officer in their daily lives, forming the core of martial arts training and laying the foundation for inevitable victory. (4) The Creed of Soldiers: Soldiers should kill the enemy as one against a hundred and never retreat. If the battle is fierce and the commanding officer is lost, they must take command and fight bravely. If weapons are damaged and ammunition is exhausted, they should bite the enemy to death with their bare hands. Retreating or being captured is more shameful than being unfaithful or unfilial. If this is the case, then how can we face the comrades who sleep peacefully in the Yasukuni Shrine? (5) All-Out Attack in a Desperate Battle: Advancing is death, retreating is death. If you want to survive in death, you must make a deadly attack. All soldiers should rise up and advance, striving to kill the enemy. (6) View of Life and Death: The great spirit of loyalty to the country is to see through life and death. The loyal and sincere fighting spirit of Da Nan Gong (Kusunoki Masashige) is the teaching of "seven lives to repay the country." We should inherit the fighting spirit of the fallen comrades on Palau Island, fight bravely and kill the enemy as one against a hundred, so that it will be forever engraved in the hearts of the people.</p>
<h3>Afforestation Committee Holds Second Meeting</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Provisional Committee for the Capital Afforestation Movement held its second committee meeting on the 8th. Chen Yanshan, Director of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, reported on the work of the committee since its establishment and passed the following resolutions: (1) Decided on the order of events for this year's Arbor Day ceremony. (2) Proposed that Minister Chen Junhui forward a request to the Chairman to attend and preside over the Arbor Day ceremony, and sent letters to the heads of the various ministries and departments to participate. (3) Drafted standards for evaluating the performance of tree planting by representatives of various organizations and groups, and requested the tree planting team to be responsible for judging the merits and demerits, announcing them on the 18th, and awarding prizes on the 19th. (4) Regarding the saplings planted in this year's memorial forest, requested the Mausoleum Administration to protect them nearby. The meeting adjourned at approximately 5 o'clock.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Issue of Layoffs and Salary Increases</h3>
<p>Recently, various institutions, organizations, and industries in this city have been implementing layoffs and salary increases, streamlining their organizations, and laying off personnel in order to use the saved funds to improve the salaries of current employees, allowing them to meet their basic needs and thereby maintain work efficiency. This is an unavoidable measure under the current circumstances, where various institutions, organizations, and industries are struggling to support their own operations but are unable to increase expenditures. Regarding the issue of assisting those who are unemployed after being laid off, we have already briefly presented our views in the editorial on February 27th. Now, we would like to offer some suggestions on the implementation of layoffs and salary increases, which may serve as a reference for all parties.</p>
<p>First, the current trend of layoffs should not be used by some people, especially business owners, as an excuse to dismiss their service personnel. Some bosses and managers, after enriching themselves, may have been lamenting the lack of an opportunity to kick out their long-term partners who have shared their hardships. They are now taking advantage of the situation, believing that they will no longer be subject to social and moral sanctions. This really needs to be corrected. We believe that companies and merchants that still have considerable financial resources or are not particularly exhausted should not follow suit with layoffs or lay off too many people. When arbitrating layoff disputes, the government should first investigate the actual strength of each institution in order to be fair, and those who abuse layoffs by taking advantage of the situation should be corrected.</p>
<p>Second, after deciding on layoffs, the authorities, especially government agencies, must be impartial and selfless in their selection process and must not rely solely on the personal likes, dislikes, and relationships of supervisors and the influence of introducers as the standard. The first to be laid off should be those who do not come to work but receive full pay, and those who only sit at their desks and have nothing to do. The second should be those who have jobs but are part-time and cannot concentrate on their work, and those with lower abilities. As for those who are diligent in their duties and have strong abilities, they must be retained as much as possible. Although this is an old saying, it is something that the authorities should pay close attention to again and again.</p>
<p>Third, those who are laid off must be given appropriate severance pay, and additional compensation should be added based on their daily performance or length of service. Additional compensation can be determined by each unit, but we believe that the most reasonable severance pay should include salary and various allowances, or it would be even better to provide various conveniences for returning to their hometown. As for the issue of raising the salaries of retained employees, we believe that not only should all the original salaries saved from those who were laid off be added to the salaries of those who remain, but also all kinds of expenses saved due to the reduction in personnel should be used for salary increases as much as possible. In addition, if the economic situation permits, it is also necessary to increase some expenditures due to salary increases.</p>
<p>Second, those who are laid off should take the opportunity to plan to return to their hometown. The tightening of various industries in Shanghai is already a very common and inevitable phenomenon. There are only layoffs and no additions, so it is very difficult for those who are laid off to find work in Shanghai. Rather than sitting and eating away at their savings, it is better to disperse early and not stay in Shanghai. At the same time, those with wives, children, and families must leave Shanghai as a whole and make plans early.</p>
<p>We hope that all parties will consider the above points carefully before implementing layoffs and pay special attention when implementing layoffs and salary increases.</p>
<h3>Record of an Inspection Along the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway Line, Part One: Inquiring at the Kunshan County Government, County Magistrate Yang Replied to Questions on Security and Other Matters</h3>
<p>– Yi Tang</p>
<p>The biggest problem with the government's current administration lies in the frequent transfers of personnel. Often, a good plan is completely halted and changed due to personnel changes. During this time of war, the local government of a county faces a complex environment with too many agencies to obey, too many things to deal with, limited government funds, and insufficient manpower. In the midst of being busy and overwhelmed, it is truly difficult to build anything beneficial to the people.</p>
<p>The Kunshan County Government is better than some of the neighboring counties in terms of personnel. County Magistrate Yang Yongqing has been in office for more than two years, and most of his staff members are from the area, making it easy to get things done. If it were not for the special circumstances of wartime, I believe that County Magistrate Yang would definitely be able to achieve more than he does today.</p>
<p>County Magistrate's Answers. On March 6th, the second day after the reporter arrived in Kunshan, I went to visit the county government. County Magistrate Yang received me and answered the following questions one by one.</p>
<p>(Question) In the midst of the evacuation of people from Shanghai, what are your insights, County Magistrate? What are the difficulties in renting houses in Kunshan? Can temples and public property be lent to schools and charities moving from Shanghai?</p>
<p>(Answer) I feel that the evacuation of people from Shanghai is very necessary, especially because of the lack of supplies in Shanghai, so I am very sympathetic. However, there are limited vacant houses in Kunshan, and I am afraid that it cannot accommodate the majority of immigrants. As far as I know, Kunshan's position is also quite important, and all the temples and public property and some of the better civilian houses have recently been requisitioned. Therefore, it is actually difficult to provide housing for charitable organizations from Shanghai.</p>
<p>(Question) What is the state of public order in the county seat and the surrounding countryside? What is the progress of rice procurement?</p>
<p>(Answer) Kunshan was relatively stable in the past, but recently, due to the arrival of many "New Fourth Army" and "Loyal Salvation Army" troops, public order has deteriorated slightly. The city is of course still very peaceful, but it is hard to say in the countryside. Regarding rice procurement, the results are not very good because this county had a famine year last year.</p>
<p>(Question) What is the county's financial situation? What is the compensation for civil servants and security teams?</p>
<p>(Answer) The county's finances are in accordance with the methods promulgated by the provincial government, and there is nothing special about them. At present, the compensation for civil servants across the country is very meager (at this point, he smiled left and right), but the situation for the soldiers of the security team is much better, with each person receiving three dou of rice per month.</p>
<p>County Magistrate Yang just returned from a meeting in the countryside last night and is waiting to go to another place today, so the conversation ended here. I was introduced to Zhou Shizhang, one of the persons in charge of the Baojia office, who answered questions about the distribution, numbers, and occupations of the county's population as follows:</p>
<p>Population and Able-Bodied Men. Kunshan has jurisdiction over eleven districts, fifty-three townships, twenty-five towns, five hundred and sixty-four bao, six thousand one hundred and twenty-three jia, sixty-seven thousand five hundred and forty-two households, and three hundred and nine thousand eight hundred and forty-eight people. – This is the most recent statistic from February.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that in the total population of just under 310,000, males account for 159,119 and females account for 150,729. There are 9,000 fewer women than men, which leads to an unequal distribution. There is one unmarried man for every sixteen people. As far as the reporter knows, there are occasional instances of buying and selling of women of marriageable age in the lower classes of Kunshan, with the price roughly equal to ten shi of rice or a cow. However, the price varies depending on the age, beauty, and ugliness. In Kunshan, due to local customs, the cost of a formal marriage is very high. Although it is said that families who buy wives have to spend a whole number, it is actually cheaper, which is a serious social problem.</p>
<p>The second point worth noting is that among the 310,000 people, the number of able-bodied men aged 21 to 45 is 54,005, accounting for slightly less than one-sixth of the total population and more than one-third of the male population, which shows that the proportion of people engaged in production in Kunshan is quite large. In fact, in the countryside, women, the elderly, and the weak also work in the fields, so the countryside should be very wealthy if it were not for the frequent taxes and unavoidable natural disasters.</p>
<p>Occupational Distribution. Judging from the occupational distribution of the county's population, the number of farmers is the largest, followed by merchants, then workers, and then laborers and boatmen. According to the survey in January of this year, the distribution is as follows:</p>
<p>Occupation Category Number of People</p>
<p>Farmers 186,824</p>
<p>Merchants 65,887</p>
<p>Workers 19,939</p>
<p>Laborers 19,114</p>
<p>Boatmen 10,495</p>
<p>Civil Servants 5,441</p>
<p>Freelancers 3,260</p>
<p>Monks and Nuns 498</p>
<p>(Note: Laborers generally refer to porters, rickshaw pullers, coolies, etc., who do not belong to factories and do not have a fixed work location.) From the above table, it can be seen that the agricultural population accounts for nearly two-thirds of the total, while workers, laborers, and boatmen (part of whom are fishermen) account for one-eighth of the total population. Non-productive merchants, civil servants, freelancers, and monks and nuns account for one-quarter of the total population.</p>
<p>Observing the statistics from the most recent three months, we can see the trend of population movement in the county. The total population of the county was 310,184 in December of last year, 311,458 in January of this year, and 309,848 in February of this year. The difference between the highest and lowest in March is only 1,610 people, which is a very small number. The population mobility is low, which is the difference between an agricultural society and an industrial society.</p>
<p>Culture and Other Matters. In the midst of such tight funding and such high costs of paper and other expenses, the Baojia office's statistical work can continue unabated, and its spirit is commendable. I hope that the county can continue to provide this newspaper with materials in the future for comparison with other counties and for reference by those who study social problems.</p>
<p>According to the statistics of the Baojia, the number of able-bodied men in the whole county who have studied for three years is only 25,066, accounting for one-twelfth of the total population. This ratio is naturally still high compared to remote provinces, but it is still very backward compared to cities. There are several primary schools in the county, and the fees are not high, only around two thousand yuan. There is only one middle school. Social education is extremely underdeveloped. The county-run library is the only institution that provides mental food to the county's residents, and the books are also very scarce. The local small newspaper has ordinary sales, while Shanghai newspapers are in short supply and cannot be purchased.</p>
<p>Due to the backwardness of culture, superstition and gambling are rampant. Villagers use prayers to cure diseases, and teahouses use gambling as their main business. All of this is a symbol of the lack of popular education. (Sent from Kunshan on March 6th)</p>

<h3>Hubei Governor Ye Peng Discusses Raising Funds for Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The newly appointed Governor of Hubei Province, Ye Peng, has come to Shanghai to raise funds for disaster relief in Wuhan, which has suffered heavily from air raids. The funds that have already been raised are scheduled to be used when he takes office in the near future. When the reporter visited Mr. Ye, he was kind enough to give a brief talk: "After Wuhan suffered a serious air disaster, I was ordered to lead Hubei, so after receiving the order, I first came to Shanghai to raise disaster relief funds. Thanks to the enthusiastic support of my fellow villagers in Shanghai, it is estimated that five to six million yuan can be raised by the end of this month, and fundraising will continue for other disaster relief efforts. In addition, half of Wuhan has been reduced to rubble, and plans are underway to restore Hankou, as well as to seek restoration loans. As for how to govern, whatever is beneficial to the people will be promoted, and whatever is harmful to the people will be eliminated. Furthermore, if local security cannot be restored, there can be no politics to speak of, so the top priority must be to strive to suppress bandits and communists, pacify the locality, and allow the people to live and work in peace."</p>
<h3>Administrative Training Institute Students Pay Respects to Acting Chairman Chen and Receive Instructions</h3>

It is hoped that all students will conduct in-depth research on the innovations in local administration, in order to live up to the government's expectations. The students were greatly encouraged upon hearing this.</p>
<h3>German Defense Successful, Recaptures Lauban, Soviet Army Begins General Offensive Towards Berlin</h3>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Havas Agency reports: After extremely intense shelling, the Soviet army has begun a general offensive towards Berlin. The initial goal of the Soviet army is to occupy bases for future offensives and to break through the Küstrin fortress. In the past few days, the German army has achieved complete defensive victories on the Eastern Front. The city of Lauban has been recaptured by the German army. The battle of Pomerania remains fierce, the Soviet army's goal being to reach the Baltic coast and encircle a large part of the German army.</p>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Havas Agency reports: The Soviet army clearly intends to advance along the lower Oder River, and has launched another fierce attack near Kietz-Teerofen. Soviet infantry has advanced towards Altdam, making slight progress. The German forces in the Greifenhagen-Sydowsaue area are fighting and retreating, but have not been routed. Since the Soviet army launched a fierce attack on Kietz-Teerofen-Loumersdorf, the situation has remained unchanged, but the Soviet army has repeatedly attacked south of Botow, with no progress in their attack near Hietz. On the East Prussian front, the Soviet army launched a fierce attack from the Neuhöfer area, also without success. The fighting on the Neisse and Oder rivers is only of secondary importance.

<h3>Mussolini Calls for Cooperation with German Army</h3>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency dispatch) - On the 6th, Premier Mussolini addressed the National Republican Guard of the Fascist Republic of Brescia in northern Italy, hoping for sincere and comprehensive cooperation with the German army. The speech stated approximately the following: We must not forget the common destiny and mission of Germany and Italy. The coup d'état of July 1943 was a conspiracy. If the Italian General Staff had been well-prepared, I would not be speaking in Brescia today, but in Cairo Square. We are determined to defend every city and every home. Your cooperation with the German army must be to the greatest extent possible. We stand together in life and death because this war is a struggle for Germany's survival. Therefore, the enemy cannot destroy it. The German military and people have united to bravely defend their homeland.</p>
<h3>German Foreign Minister Issues Statement</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 8th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The New York Times on the 6th published an account by a Swedish journalist who returned from Berlin: German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop recently hosted a morning meal for diplomats from small countries and three Swedish journalists. He first stated that the German army would steadfastly defend the Rhine River line. He stated: If Germany is defeated, then we at least have the right to choose which country should defeat us and entrust Germany to that country. Although the current situation is extremely critical, there is no need for pessimism. The Allied air force is doing its utmost to destroy all buildings between the Rhine and Berlin, but this scorched-earth tactic is hindering the Allied advance.</p>
<h3>Chiang Kai-shek Will Not Attend San Francisco Conference</h3>

<h3>Population Evacuation Committee Holds Second Meeting</h3>
<p>The City's Population Evacuation Committee held its second meeting at the City Hall the day before yesterday (7th). Those in attendance included Chairman and Secretary-General, Committee members Li Sihao, Wu Yunqi, Chen Binhe, Chen Riping, Xiang Kangyuan, Gu Jiwu, Zhou Yuying, Li Mingde, Yu Shijie, Ye Wangchen, and the committee's secretaries Chen Xiqing, Cao Jingang, and over twenty others. Director Luo, serving as chairman, presided over the meeting and resolved the following cases: (1) Establish a Navigation Routes Special Committee to facilitate evacuation by waterway. The proposed waterway evacuation is divided into four routes: one to Ningbo, one to Jiangbei, one to Suzhou, and one to Hangzhou. A special committee will be established to handle this. The committee is subordinate to the Execution and Liaison Group Committee. (2) Search for and purchase large quantities of coal to supply shipping companies specifically for the use of evacuation vessels. (3) Establish a Land Route Special Committee to facilitate land evacuation. The tasks of this committee are to liaise with the Central China Railway Company to assist those voluntarily evacuating beyond Nanjing, and to independently operate automobiles on the Shanghai-Wuxi highway. (4) All ships and vehicles engaged in evacuation work are not permitted to carry cargo for profit, except for passengers and luggage, when leaving Shanghai. They are not permitted to carry passengers back to Shanghai, but on the return trip, they may transport non-controlled daily necessities to supply military, police, government personnel, and vocational group personnel at affordable prices. (5) The Liaison Group shall promptly convene representatives from various native-place associations in Shanghai with the Social Welfare Bureau to discuss the registration of citizens voluntarily evacuating. (6) The Execution Group shall promptly convene representatives from various charitable organizations in the city with the Social Welfare Bureau to discuss the mandatory evacuation of those being supported by these organizations, and stipulate that the evacuation be completed within two months. Those who delay and fail to comply with the regulations will be subject to appropriate sanctions.

The address of the inquiry office is at the Shenbao News Agency on Sanma Road, starting from the 16th of this month.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Discipline is Strict, Do Not Lightly Believe Rumors, Statement by the Japanese Military Police Headquarters</h3>
<p>Modern warfare can also be described as a war of ideology and strategy, and the Greater East Asia War is no exception. If victory cannot be achieved in the ideological war, the future of the war is difficult to predict. The Shanghai Japanese Military Police Headquarters stated that recently, the enemy has actively used strategic means, and some malicious elements have spread baseless rumors to confuse people. Therefore, a statement was issued yesterday, strongly emphasizing that the authorities are determined to crush such rumors. The statement of the Military Police Headquarters is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Recently, many citizens have been misled by the enemy's false propaganda, fabricating rumors and slandering Japanese soldiers, which is deeply regrettable. In particular, rumors such as Japanese soldiers committing indecent acts against Chinese women or corresponding with them are rife. However, among Japanese soldiers, there is absolutely no one who engages in such behavior, because the Japanese military discipline has always been extremely strict. If anyone violates military or disciplinary rules, they will definitely be severely punished by military law, which is a well-known fact. However, the enemy, in an attempt to slander the Japanese army, often fabricates rumors to mislead the public, which is a consistent tactic of the enemy. After detailed investigation, it has been found that the spreading of rumors is completely baseless and purely fabricated by the enemy. In the future, if anyone is found to be used by the enemy's strategy and verbally spreads such rumors, they will be regarded as deliberately insulting the Japanese army and will be severely punished. It is also hoped that when citizens hear such rumors, they will immediately report the detailed facts to the Military Police.</p>
<h3>City Government Holds Commemoration Ceremony Today</h3>
<p>Today is the National Government's War Participation Memorial Day. As a matter of routine, the city government will hold a commemoration ceremony at 10:00 AM in the conference room. In addition to the leadership of senior city government officials, the chiefs of various departments and directors will also attend.</p>
<h3>Today is Air Defense Day, Implement Air Defense Training, Hold Various Comprehensive Exercises</h3>
<p>Today (9th) is the 15th Air Defense Day. As a matter of routine, the city's Air Defense Headquarters is expanding its publicity of the meaning of air defense and implementing various major air defense training exercises. The time and methods of the alert training have already been published in yesterday's newspapers. Other training details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Local Training: This local air defense general configuration training will be held within the jurisdictions of the Old Zha and New Cheng sub-bureaus, with Nanjing Road and Jing'an Temple Road as the boundary line, divided into north and south districts. It is scheduled that the north district will start from 10:00 AM and the south district will start from 4:00 PM, each conducting training within two hours with small areas (groups within air defense districts) below the Bao level as units, so that all families and all residents can implement training at the same time. The greatest goal of this local training is to promote the general public's will for air defense and conduct practical training.</p>
<p>After the air raid alert is issued at 10:00 AM, traffic control will be implemented throughout the city, and vehicles and pedestrians will be prohibited from passing. After about 20 minutes, traffic, except for vehicles, will be restored.</p>
<p>Shelter Training: Areas under the jurisdiction of various sub-bureaus that do not participate in the local general configuration should, when the air raid alert is issued at 4:00 PM, imagine a large enemy aircraft formation coming to bomb everywhere, and thoroughly implement shelter training throughout the city for one hour. Police and air defense instructors will explain the essentials of shelter to the public, and administrative restraint will be taken against those who maliciously refuse to cooperate.</p>
<p>Lights-Out: From the issuance of the training alert at 7:00 PM to the lifting of the alert at 8:45 PM, a total of one hour and forty-five minutes. At that time, the lights-out squads of each sub-reporting office should strictly report any violations of the lights-out regulations the next day for investigation and sealing.</p>
<p>Alert Transmission: Alert transmission training is very important, because in the future, when the situation is very bad, it may be difficult to sound the alert siren, and whether the method of alert transmission is appropriate is crucial to reducing disasters. Therefore, at the time of each alert issuance and cancellation, the announced time should be imagined as an actual alert, and each police sub-bureau should be the main body, organizing alert transmission squads and alert reception stations, etc., to examine records so that corrections can be made.</p>
<h3>Finance Bureau Collects Business Tax, Convenes Discussions with Various Industries, Explaining the Meaning of Tax Collection and Tax Rates</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Finance Bureau, in order to collect the Business Tax for the spring of this year (34th year) in the former No. 1 and No. 8 districts, specially convened representatives of various industry guilds at the City Chamber of Commerce auditorium at 3:00 PM yesterday (8th) to hold a discussion meeting. Representatives from over 240 units, including the cotton cloth industry, silk industry, banking industry, money shop industry, Chinese medicine industry, cigarette industry, tea and food industry, grain industry, flour industry, Chinese and foreign department store industry, coal briquette industry, and chemical industry guilds, attended. Director Luo specially dispatched Chief Secretary Xu Songping to attend and deliver a speech, explaining the meaning of collecting Business Tax in the former No. 1 and No. 8 districts, the standard tax rates for various merchants to declare and pay Business Tax, and the main points of the declaration procedures. Subsequently, Section Chief Tang of the Business Tax Section explained questions, and the meeting adjourned at around 6:00 PM. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Chief Secretary Xu Songping's Speech: Chief Secretary Xu said in his speech, roughly: Today, I am here representing Director Luo to discuss the Business Tax situation in Shanghai's No. 1 and No. 8 districts with representatives from various industries. Business Tax is one of the normal national taxes. In the past, due to the concession system, it was not possible to uniformly collect Business Tax. Now that the concessions have long been recovered and normal conditions have been restored, the Finance Bureau has also decided to start collecting it in the spring of this 34th year. The collection method will be based on the sales amount of the sales industry and the capital amount of the manufacturing industry. It is hoped that various industries will truthfully report according to the declaration procedures to avoid being punished for untruthful reporting upon review. As for the past malpractice of extortion, the Bureau has absolutely suppressed it since Secretary-General Luo took over. I hope that various industries and everyone will provide assistance from time to time and exchange opinions frequently.</p>
<p>Key Points for Declaring and Paying Taxes: Key points for various industries to declare and pay taxes: (1) Declaration forms will be collected and distributed by various industry guilds. (2) After members of various industry guilds receive the declaration forms, they must be submitted to the collection section of the Business Tax Section of the Bureau within five days for submission by the guild. (3) The person in charge of each industry guild should earnestly advise members to truthfully declare their sales amount and not to over-report or under-report, so as to avoid punishment. (4) The sales amount for the winter of the 33rd year, that is, the sales amount for October, November, and December, will be used as the standard. The spring Business Tax will be paid according to the prescribed tax rate based on the winter sales amount. (5) The tax rates for various industries will be notified separately by the Bureau in accordance with the provisions of the Business Tax Regulations after being reported. Tax rate tables are distributed for reference. (6) In order to facilitate the payment of taxes by merchants and citizens, the Bureau has divided the jurisdiction of the former No. 1 and No. 8 districts into six districts for collection. Various industries can pay taxes at the nearest collection office. (7) The taxation standard for the sales industry is based on the sales amount, and the taxation standard for the manufacturing industry is based on the capital amount.</p>

<h3>Construction Bureau Adjusts Vehicle Registration Procedures, Effective from the 12th of This Month</h3>
<p>The city's Construction Bureau, due to its relocation to the Municipal Government Office, has re-adjusted vehicle registration procedures for each district, which were previously handled by district vehicle registration offices. To streamline future operations, the bureau has altered all city registration offices. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding Vehicle Inspection and License Issuance: (1) Private and commercial automobiles must henceforth be inspected, registered, and licensed centrally by the bureau. (Located at the former site of the First District Donation Office on Jiangxi Road, entrance via Hankou Road). (2) Private and commercial trucks, after approval and certification by the bureau, will be inspected and registered at the Jiangning Road Vehicle Registration Office, followed by the issuance of ribbon licenses. Magnetic license plates will then be obtained from the bureau. (3) The former Public Utilities Bureau's Madang Road Vehicle Registration Office is abolished. All private pedicabs and private rickshaws may be registered at the Jiangning Road, Changning Road, Gongping Road, Huxi, Nanshi, and Zhabei vehicle registration offices, based on the vehicle owner's residential address. Private rickshaws in the former city area will continue to follow the previous practice and register at their original registration office. (4) Commercial pedicabs, after registration approval by the bureau, will be inspected and licensed at both Jiangning Road and Changxing Road offices. The former First District, Zhabei, Hubbei, Huxi and other areas will now be under the jurisdiction of the Jiangning Road Registration Office. The former Eighth District, Nanshi, Xu Cao, and other areas will now be under the jurisdiction of the Changxing Road Registration Office. (5) Commercial rickshaws and other vehicles will continue to be inspected and licensed by their original registration offices. Regarding driver's license examinations and the issuance of motor vehicle driver's licenses, these will be handled by the bureau. Pedicab driver's licenses were previously applied for at the Public Utilities Bureau; those who have not yet received them will now be issued by the Changxing Road Registration Office. New applicants should follow procedures at the bureau's various district vehicle registration offices based on the driver's residential address. Rickshaw driver's licenses previously applied for at the Public Utilities Bureau but not yet received will all be issued by the Changxing Road Registration Office. New applicants should apply at the bureau's various district registration offices based on the driver's residential address.

<h3>Police Bureau Retires Personnel, Pays Retirement Benefits</h3>
<p>In order to refresh police administration and adjust personnel, the Municipal Police Bureau has eliminated redundant staff. On February 23, a method for paying retirement benefits was announced to demonstrate consideration for retiring personnel. The method is as follows: (1) Those with service of one year or more, but less than three years, will receive two months of salary and allowances. (2) Those with service of less than five years will receive three months of salary and allowances. (3) Those with service of less than ten years will receive four months of salary and allowances. (4) Those with service of fifteen years or more will receive six months of salary and allowances. (5) The standard for issuing salary and allowances for retiring officers and police will be based on the salary and allowance amount in January 1945. Over two thousand dismissed personnel have been announced in batches starting on the first of the month, and each branch bureau, station, and team has been instructed to process applications for retiring officers and police according to the above method and issue payments accordingly. It has come to light that some branch bureau chiefs have not yet implemented this method, which is unreasonable. Therefore, the bureau has re-issued an order to immediately fill out forms in accordance with the promulgated method and apply to the accounting section for the actual payment in order to complete the procedures.</p>
<h3>Deadline for Capital Increase for Financial Institutions</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance promulgated an Outline for Strengthening the Operations of Financial Institutions in Shanghai Special Municipality on December 10 of last year. Any financial institution in Shanghai whose average daily total deposits within three months after the implementation of the outline are less than (1) 30 million yuan for banks, (2) 15 million yuan for native banks, and (3) 20 million yuan for trust companies shall increase capital or merge within two months after the expiration of the three-month period of the outline implementation. Failure to do so will result in closure. As of January 21 of this year, the three-month period had expired, and approximately 70% or more of financial institutions had an average daily total deposit amount less than the prescribed amount. These financial institutions have been supervised by the Central Bank Gold Examination Office to handle capital increase procedures since January 21. It is estimated that the actual collection is 15 million yuan for banks, 8 million yuan for native banks, and 10 million yuan for trust companies. It is learned that the deadline for capital increase for various financial institutions will expire on the 21st of this month and will not be extended. If the prescribed capital amount has not been fully increased within these two weeks, the institution will be banned and closed. It is reported that up to recently, more than 240 financial institutions (including banks and native banks) have completed capital increase procedures, while 20 to 30 have not yet completed the capital increase procedures.</p>

<h3>North Station Police Branch Chief Announces Details of the Incident Where a Woman Was Beaten to Death by a Man Wearing a Black Hat</h3>
<p>Regarding the case at the Shanghai Station of the China Central Railway Company, in which Jiang Shiyan, affiliated with the station, violently beat Xu Peiwen, a female staff member of the Railway Protection Section of the China Central Railway Police Department, resulting in her death, Director Liu of the North Station Branch, due to the public's lack of understanding of the details of this case, gave an open statement to the Central News Agency reporter yesterday (8th) regarding the incident, as follows:</p>
<p>Female Clerk of China Central Railway: This case occurred at approximately 7:00 AM on the 4th of this month. The victim's name was Xu Peiwen, female, from Wuxi, age 25, and was currently a female clerk in the Railway Protection Section of the China Central Railway Police Department. The perpetrator was Jiang Shiyan, a deputy squad leader of Group C affiliated with the station, from Yancheng, age 25. The victim's husband's name is Xu Sen, who was also an employee of China Central Railway a year ago, holding the position of draft handler. The incident occurred because, on the morning of the incident, the victim and her husband were returning to their hometown of Zhenjiang for some reason. When queuing to purchase tickets, they did not follow the order and were whipped by the perpetrator Jiang, resulting in a verbal dispute.</p>
<p>Kicked in Vital Abdominal Area: Subsequently, Jiang forcibly took the woman to the office affiliated with the station and illegally beat her, using his foot to kick Xu's abdomen and other vital areas. Later, Li Yixuan, the squad leader of the station, and Zhang Hongsheng (who had a friendly relationship with the deceased) arrived to mediate. After joint discussion, Xu's husband, Xu Sen, accompanied the injured woman to Zhang Hongsheng's home to rest. At that time, Xu Sen thought that his wife's injuries were not serious, so he did not report it to the police. However, after arriving at Zhang's home, the injured woman repeatedly cried out in pain in her chest and abdomen. It was then that Li Yixuan and Xu Sen took the injured woman to Shanghai Sanatorium Hospital at No. 171 Bazilu, Hongkou, for treatment. Dr. Chen of the hospital diagnosed the injuries as severe, with the left kidney split into two pieces and severe internal bleeding in the abdomen and back, posing a serious threat to her life. According to regulations, the Hongkou Branch was immediately notified.</p>
<p>Clues to the Perpetrator's Whereabouts: The branch informed the North Station Branch, which had jurisdiction over the area where the incident occurred, about four hours after the time of the incident. After receiving the notification, I immediately ordered detectives Gao Chengye and others to go to the North Station to arrest the perpetrator. However, the perpetrator had already fled and could not be found. Many suspects were arrested and brought to the bureau for investigation, and a strict order was issued to pursue the fugitive. Also, when Li Yixuan, the squad leader of the station, accompanied the injured woman to the hospital, he left the hospital for forty minutes after the doctor confirmed the severity of the injuries. He is suspected of instigating the perpetrator to flee. Therefore, this branch has arrested him for investigation and is collecting various evidence to detain him within a few days and file a lawsuit with the local prosecutor's office in accordance with the law. Regarding the principal offender, after the detectives in charge of the case made every effort to investigate, they have substantial clues and should be able to solve the case soon.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it has been found that the China Central Railway authorities have remained silent throughout the days since the incident occurred, which has caused deep regret from all sectors.</p>
