<h3>北太平洋入作戰季節　日駐軍嚴陳以待　美認日北部已增加重要性</h3>
<p>北方基地六日中央社電　太平洋北部戰綫，於一年間唯夏季爲最宜作戰季節，敵軍於北方戰綫之動向如何，綜合最近敵方之情報，即可明瞭。敵在該戰綫配置頗劣勢之兵力，僅以若干艘輕巡洋艦及驅逐艦之第九艦隊爲中心，以頗劣勢之中小型機及戰鬥機爲主幹之空軍，配備於陸上基地，僅使太平洋潛水艦隊之一部，由中途島方面蠢動而已，此因受氣候及共他自然現象之牽制，並非敵方輕視北方戰綫。七月十日，敵機動部隊攻擊日本土時，對室蘭加以艦砲射擊，繼派遣少數之機動部隊，活動於福島方面，同時B29型機偵察頻繁，七月二十八日更對靑森市加以燒夷彈攻擊，如是，由B29型對北海道實施戰略轟炸之可能性，及由硫黃島冲繩基地對　太·千島方面航空攻擊之可能性等觀之，今敵以誇稱爲「北方眞珠灣」之阿留申方面之諸基地爲中心，繼續蠢動。美軍事記者鮑德英論及最近之太平洋戰略云，與南方作戰平行，向日千島之進攻作戰，北方戰線極其重要性，其理由可列舉如下：　該地現已入作戰季節。　日本北部已增加其重要性等是，但日方對敵軍之北方進攻作戰，北方日陸海軍精銳已布成堅陣，等待殲敵之良機矣。</p>
<h3>美第一線司令官主設最高指揮部　太平洋戰局漸達高湖</h3>
<p>里斯本六日中央社電　最近數日來，關於太平洋戰爭，敵方有三國重要公布，即一·英·美兩國共同宣言，二·麥克沃塞掌握琉球基地，三·杜立德之設立統一最高司令部案是，敵人對日總攻擊之根本問題，現於共同聲明當可知已決定，麥克沃塞指揮權之擴大，係共同聲明之所謂「地域及統帥之變更」之初步工作，，倘若麥克沃塞指揮權之擴張，係波次坦戰略方式之部份，則指揮東南亞洲軍之英將蒙特巴頓駐防戰區，亦將發生變更，乃可想像所及者。據合衆社華盛頓電，預料英軍爲準備奪回進攻太平洋水域之惟一近道昭南及麻六甲海峽——，特巴頓恐將置東印度羣島於自己指揮之下，然關於指揮權最重要之最高司令部設置問題，與歐洲情形不同，至今末見決定，對日共同聲明中，對此亦未有提及。杜立德於航空隊紀念日演設中曾言及，負責之第一綫司令官，已提出設立最高司令部之意見，又謂麥克沃塞司令都，准許上項消息之公開發表，一時頗引人注目，惟華盛頓美陸部則宣稱，上項意見並非陸軍之正式意見，消息靈通方面則指出，杜立德因目前無最高司令部，致發生種種困難情形，或係對於上級機關，對於瑣散小事，亦均下令指示，感覺不滿，故有上項建議，惟亦有以爲杜立德對於戰略航空隊與戰術航空隊（凱尼所部遠東航空隊）與麥克沃塞之三角關係頗抱不滿，吾人想及杜立德之第八航空隊業已進駐本由凱尼航空隊駐守之冲繩基地一事實，當知上述消息並非空穴來風。</p>
<h3>伊藤整一氏普及大將日海軍省發表</h3>
<p>東京六日中央社電　據日海軍省發表稱，昭和二十年四月，於冲繩周邊發動銜鋒作戰時，曾發揮日水上部隊精華之海上特別攻擊隊指揮官伊藤海軍中將等將兵，爲護護衛皇土，業殉身於大義，茲者，日聯合艦隊司令長官維嘉賞其殊動計，將其事跡布吿全軍。又據當日之海軍省發表，海軍中將伊藤整一，追謚進級爲海軍大將。按伊藤大將福岡縣人校畢業，歷任愛宕楱名各艦長，昭和十二年　任少將，十三年任人事局長，調任海上某要職，十六年九月任軍今部次長，十月　進中將，十九年由海上某要職任爲第　海上特別攻擊隊司令官。</p>
<h3>國民黨的再檢討（一）</h3>
<p>— 陳公博</p>
<p>國民黨與憲政</p>
<p>民國十七年的春間，在「革命評論」米出版以前，我曾草一篇文章，先登在陳俠國先生所主刋的「貢獻」雜誌，後來即成小册子，題目喚做「民革命的危機和我們的錯誤」。當時曾振動每一個戴內外靑年的心絃。那篇文章登出後，就引起後來「革命評論」的出版，那篇文章算是第一期北伐完成后對國民革命的總檢討，也是對於國民黨第一次的檢討，大體着眼於革命力量的薄弱和批評，當時國民黨對於環境，尤其對於帝國主義的屈服。</p>
<p>自此以後我隊愚黨沒有寫過批評，十八年由廣州之役，十九年而又有擴大會議之役，那時正忙於軍事，遂無暇更談理論。迨至擴大會議失敗，我想我的修養還不够罷，於二十年一月悄然去國，冀求自省，那年廣州非常會議，我就沒有參加。至九月歸途，舟過哥　堡，即聞有九一八事變，當時我在印度洋的舟中，不禁萬感交集，那夜成了一首詩：「海上凄淸百感生，頻年擾攘未休兵，獨留肝膽對明月，老去方知厭黨爭。」我決心不再談黨爭，而希望盡我的力量，有助於國事，幷且那時還想趕連歸粵，　非常會議諸同志息爭，以謀球國。不料剛抵香港，知道陳銘樞同志已在奔走調停，寗粤可以合作，眞使我喜出望外，末後我參加南京政府，即銳意從振興實業着想，對黨務，我矢口不談，改組同志會，固然早於二十年一月解散，即對於後來黨內的小派別，我祇苦口婆心的去勸他們取消成見，泯滅私益，後來於民國二十四年十二月解職，猶是　居南京，靜觀其變。我之不談黨第一實在不願再惹起無聊的糾紛，第二國民黨的眞精神，業已中墮，談也無補，我不談，或者少引些誤解，使不家埋首於救國工作。這樣雖於黨無益，或者於國有利，這是我當時的想法。當時許多仍朋友都在背後譏評收歸眞返瑛，我還是付之一笑，置之不理。</p>
<p>現在實施憲政和設立民意機關的呼聲，還於全國，除了延安的共產黨要召集解放人民代表大會，其目的在對抗重慶，企圖分立以外，重慶有於本年十一月召集國民大會的決議，而在南京治下，北平早於去年提倡統一救國，近年春間，人民代表會且開大會於南京，要求統一，要求設置民意機關，可見實施憲政和設立民意機關，已是全國普遍的要求了。</p>
<p>人民爲什麼要實施憲政？自然是一種反對一黨專政而要求還政於民的表示，這一點，我實在是同情而且願意盡我的力量促成的，民國成立至今，已三十四年，始終沒有一部上下相守的憲法，這是一種笑話，也是一種恥辱，照着國民黨所守的軍政，訓政，憲政三個時期來說，憲政也應該早已現了，因爲我不但同情憲政的實施和民意機關的設立，而且我更願意促成實施和設立的時日。</p>
<p>中華民國的創建，實靱於國民黨前身的同盟會，中國能夠名義上一度勉强統一，實蹄功於國民政府統轄下的國民革命軍，然而縱使國民黨有功於國，却不能說國民黨一定要家天下，何况中華民國的成立和統一的完成，其主要原因，在於全體民衆的擁護和努力，才能收效，因之一黨專政，不過暫時，而還政於民，乃天經地義</p>
<p>不過我還要代國民黨辯護的，什麼是一黨專政？我們爲什麼反對一黨專政？我提不出確切的答案。要求憲政，不自今日始，在民十七時候，已經有縮短訓政時期的呼聲了，當時我對於訓政有一種解釋，就是所謂訓政，應當以黨的政策來訓政，而不是專以黨員來常政權，我當時所知要說國民黨的政綱不對罷，沒有一個人說過他不對，就算他不對罷，當日的國民政府實在沒有施行過黨的政　，別的不必說，連最溫和的土地法，在十八年至二十年的南京政府沒有實行過，在二十一年至二十四年，我參加後的南京政府，也沒有實行過，那麼反對訓政實在從何說起。要說單以黨員執政爲不對罷，我分析自有南京政府以來，沒有設過一屆最高行政機構的行政院，全體部長，都是國民黨黨員，也有些因爲軍事合作而派一個代表人參加的，也有些因爲做了部長而才掛名國民黨的，這些閣員的言論和行動，都不受黨的束縛的，他們的意見和進退，是由其背後勢力支配的。我時常想號稱以黨專政的國民黨連普通的政黨內閣還不如，還談什麼呢？以此而以訓政爲不當，要反對訓政，我覺得太突梯滑稽而無理。</p>
<p>可是誰呌國民黨沒有勇氣拿出政綱來訓政？誰　國民黨沒有辦法抽出黨員來當政？所以經過一個時期，我也主張取消訓政而急促實施憲政，至於今日，我們也不必再去重翻檔案，爭響是非了，實施憲政和設立民意機稱是毫無猶豫的餘地了。</p>
<p>在實施憲政後的國民黨究竟怎樣呢？有些黨員以爲國民黨還要保持它的特殊地位，有些黨員則主張應同於普通政黨的地位，但在我呢，倒不關心於國民黨的地位問題，而獨關心於黨的本身問題，如果本身不健全，全國人民就承認擬由優越的地位，你能但當國家的大任嗎？我這篇文章就針對這個問題而加以再檢討的，同時我更聲明憲政眞要實施，各個政黨除了要顚覆中華民國的黨以外，我國願意忠吿他們自行檢討，無論是否南京治下的各黨各派，我坦白說句話，他們本身許多問題，就有詳細虛心檢討的必要，因爲政黨的利害不是本身的利害，而是國家的利害，以不健全的黨而想但當國事，小則　民，大則害國，我們應　除客氣，深自警惕。（未完待績）</p>
<h3>B29型等機　昨襲日各地　先後被擊落毀十八架</h3>
<p>東京六日中央社電　敵機B29型二百八十五架，五日晚九時半至六日晨三時之間，分三羣來襲近畿·中國，其主力以燃燒彈攻擊今治·神戶·西之宮東西地帶，一部復曾於日本海沿岸，瀨戶內海投下機雷。今治·神戶·西之宮東西地帶曾發生火　，迄六日晨已行撲滅，日方迎擊戰國，迄六日上午十十，判明擊落敵機八架。</p>
<p>東京六日中央社電　敵機B29型來襲關西，中國方面，同時於五日下午九時半起至六日上午三時之間，敵機B29型三十架，由土佐灣侵入，於米茲附近，分二波狀，十二架於羅津，十八架於若狹灣各投下機雷。又敵戰門機及轟炸機約三百八十架，五日下午　數小時，攻擊九州地區日航空基地軍事設施。</p>
<p>東京六日中央社電　敵機B29型百三十架由五日晚九時三十分，約歷二小時，以　夷彈攻擊羣馬南部地區，致前橋·高　兩市及　川町發生火災，然至六日拂曉業已撲滅。敵機於此次空襲時，曾使先頭之一編隊，侵入東北軍管區內，以欺瞞地上之防空陣。</p>
<p>東京六日中央社電　敵機B29型約百二十架，先後分爲二批，由六日上午八時三十分許，歷一小時，來展關東地區，活動於琦玉，羣島，　木，千　，茨城等地，主要攻擊軍需設施，一部對交通機關，市街地帶加以機槍掃射，截止是日上午十一時，判明日空軍機隊迎擊戰果，計擊落七架，擊破一三架，此戰果尙可擴大。</p>
<p>代論</p>
<h3>關於中小學校疏散問題</h3>
<p>— 陳彬龢</p>
<p>本月一日，市政諮詢委員會舉行全體會議，曾提出關於中小學校疏散一案，經公布以後，聞外間不無誤解之傳說，我特地作一解釋如次：　戰時　的學校疏散，已爲　　家所必有的措置。上海是戰時都市，自不能例外，更於七月十七日後，本市連遭空襲，而其趨勢復有搬大可能，爲減少損害，學校疏散自應及早準備，因此諮詢會有此項提案討論。實際上，這種建議已其必然性，無須加以解釋理由，而且，論理早應準備實施，不必等待空襲發生以後方言疏散了。</p>
<p>目前除了學校以外，其餘如慈善等團體，都藉口內地的治安不佳，遲不疏散。其實，窮鄕僻壤，雖或治安稍差，但距離交通綫較遠的城鎭，治安並不如一般理想之不佳。因此，學校如能就治安較佳的城鎮疏散，不受都市空襲危險，則學生家長也必樂於遣送子弟隨校入學。我們認爲問題不在於治安方面，而在於團體主持人的茍安心理，缺乏創造新環境的精神</p>
<p>學校疏散以後，敎職員之生活，幷不發生困難問題，因爲學校經費照常維持，而遷移費用，自當由市政府　撥補助。所以，學校疏散，在學校方面旣無損失，在敎職員生活方面，更無影響。總之，敎職員的生活必須予以保障</p>
<p>七月二十八日市民福利會與市政有關當局爲懇談空襲救濟工作時，羅秘書長曾說過，爲設立空襲受傷救濟醫院，目前無適當房屋，應選擇地點適中之小學校暫行停課，以校舍讓出闢作醫院之用，當時出席人員頗多贊同。這種爲適應環境需要而有之治標處置，固無不可，但與其讓屋停課，不如疏散離滬，易地開學，不失爲治本措置。退一步言，仍可利用學生住所之昆鄰接近者，分別集中適當之學生住所數處，請原有敎員補課，則學校雖停辦，而學業仍不中　。</p>
<p>當諮詢會討論本案時，出席人員對於原則上一致贊同，惟對實施上，亦有主張並無立即疏散的必要者。商議結果，送交市敎育局硏究辦理。因此，外間批評市政當局及諮詢會方面，這是不重視敎育的表示。然而，我們認爲這種批評適得其反，我們建議中小學疏散，正是保護敎育，重視敎育的表示，而絕不是摧殘敎育。還有人說，爲什麼只提中小學疏散，而不討論大學疏散呢？因爲大學不在市府管理範圍。不過，我們對於大學及專科學校之有疏散必要，早在數月以前即已竭力主張，不久以前（七月二十五日）本報社評「學校應準備疏散」，巳經特別指出大學及專科學校應先疏散了。</p>

<h3>峇厘巴板戰事　呈紆援狀態</h3>
<p>南方前綫基地六日中央社電　峇厘巴板方面敵軍，戰意極爲萎　，三馬林達公路附近之戰鬥，悉呈紆緩狀態。三十日以來，敵軍曾由鄧巴頓與峇厘巴板對岸之昆巴馬爾方面，於艦砲射擊與空軍轟炸掩護下前來攻擊，但遭日軍夜襲及挺身肉搏而將其擊退。三是一日與一日兩日間，日軍戰國如此：炸毀兵營五處，物資囤積所一處，載重汽車一輛，殺傷敵兵一百餘名。</p>

<h3>渝共衝突內幕　雙方均致力宣傅攻勢</h3>
<p>中央社訊邇來延安第十八集團軍總司令朱德，與陝甘寗晉綏五省邊區聯防軍司令賀龍，雖然一再發出通電要求停戰，然重慶仍向耀縣·淳化·及同官·白水一帶增加兵力，而佈置由東南西三方面進攻延安之戰略態勢。此次重慶軍之行動，顯係因延安長期攻擊渝方日趨劇烈，而爲渝府採取武力彈壓之一種非常手段。關於此次渝延軍事衝突，現綜合渝方各消息靈通人士之觀測，重慶態度雖特別强硬，然而重慶鑒諸目前國內發生戰亂，對內對外均極爲不利之情勢，其種種舉動似尚未出威嚇之地步，而延安則利用重慶此其有利之宣傅攻勢，　其目標或在於把握機會，以期發展進至國際關係。按重農政權對延安所抱之態度如次：　處茲抗戰最終局面，不欲引起內亂，　延安軍力　極爲脆弱，必要時一舉即可將其殲滅，　依富前國際情勢觀之，目下引起內戰極爲不利，　重慶政府發言張平羣亦發表謂，將使用政治手段解決。惟重慶政權呼號抗日繼續戰爭，迄今業已九載，於民生疲弊百業凋零之中，妄圖今後再稍奮鬥，即可獲得勝利，現延安不論以任何積極手段進擊，然若演變爲國內戰爭，則民生當更陷入於水深火熱之中，　尤有進者，恐使國民怨聲　道，數載之抗戰亦將徒勞無功，難免使已提高至世界大國之重慶政權，蒙上「國內尙未統一」之一大汚點，致國際尊嚴一掃塗地，故希圖完全以政治手段解決延安問題，一俟抗戰吿終，即欲以武力一舉掃除延安勢力。故當發生軍事衝突之後，即授命重慶發言人，再三聲明由政府解決之意向，而暗示對延安進行，亦令朱德賀龍前後發出通電，要求重慶即時停戰，朱德之電文對重慶之積極武力進攻，則以消極之口吻，向全國民衆及國際間呼　，欲期獲得同情，而思將衝突事件之責任轉嫁於重慶，乃該電之一大特色。而該電發出一周後之七月　七日，賀　　拍發電報表明謂，如渝軍再增强武力，則決集結陝甘靑　綏五省兵力斷然反抗。且延安深知渝方現決不願　大至內戰，故其政治方面尚固執樹立聯合政府，繼績準備召開解放地區人民代表大會。由其外表而觀，渝延雙方現皆銳力宣傳，各自施展外交手段，而渝府如　續此種武力衝突現狀，則即將復開之莫斯科會談，恐將蒙受重大影響，重慶之允塲可謂進退維谷。</p>
<h3>下屆三巨頭會議　將在華盛頓舉行　史太林返抵莫斯科</h3>
<p>東京五日中央社電　倫敦路透社引紐約電訊：美總統特魯曼於返國途中，在「奥古斯特」巡艦上曾發表談話，略謂，「渠在波次坦會談時，已建議下次三頭會議當在華盛頓舉行。關於此項建議，史太林元帥表示屆時如屬可能，渠亦將暫離蘇聯以參加會議，同時阿特里首相亦並未表示反對。</p>
<p>瑞典京城六日中央社電　據莫斯科電台廣播稱：蘇聯最高統帥史太林及外長莫洛托夫，已於五日返抵莫斯科。</p>
<p>蘇聯外交獲得勝利</p>
<p>瑞典京城六日中央社電　特魯曼·邱吉爾對此三頭會議，原定拒絕史太林議長之要求，使蘇聯順從美英兩國政策，此固不難想像者。惟根據發表之公報，則美英兩國完全被蘇聯控制，蘇聯之要求無一不被通過。據路透社倫敦電報述各國反響如次：</p>
<p>特魯曼急於搭乘巡洋艦「奧古斯特」號返國，但在末決定返國之前，即用綫綫電向全國民衆報吿會談之詳細情形，窺其用意，實欲避免國民資難其對史太林之讓步也。又瑞典及法國重視該公報中全然未涉及對日本之宣言，法國新聞記者論稱，波次坦會談之各項決定，如蘇聯對東亞問題之態度不加具體表明，則其意義盡失。再綜合各國新聞界之反響如次；美國各新聞界之論調，極偏重常識的，認爲波次坦宣言爲德黑蘭及雅爾達宣言之更進一步，對國際和平設定新的先例。法國報界頗注意法國被選爲聯合國外長理事會之一員，但吉期社倫斯報反問曰，「阿特里能否有資格做和平之邱吉爾」，語氣中頗含　刺之意。西班牙廣播對波次坦公報詳細申述，惟對弗朗哥政府被摒棄於聯合國機構一點未予涉及。葡萄牙各報亦與西班牙情形相同，對弗朗哥政府被　棄一點，隻字不提。</p>
<p>美國會議員之非難</p>
<p>里斯本六日中央社電　美國議會外交界及新聞界對於波次坦宣言，各有複雜之反響，如民主黨之參議員高那里氏，即表示無條件支持此項宣言，然而共和黨之參議員達福特，則對於波蘭國境向西擴張一項堅決反對，而言此種作法，實爲掀起新戰爭之根源，故對於特魯曼不經議會承認，即對蘇聯讓步一事，一致痛烈非難。外交界對於五大國外長理事會，認爲純係大國媾和會議之獨裁，徒爲使小國循例育從之機構。據重慶中央社華盛頓電稱，當地一般人士皆以爲理事會之包括渝法兩國，實乃謀使獨裁合理之手段也云，而新聞界則諱言此次宣言之未涉及日本問題，乃波次坦會談之失敗表徵。重慶中央社紐約電復報稱，特魯曼歸國後，因國內意外冷靜，而感到特別苦悶。</p>
<h3>聯合國準委員周四在英舉行</h3>
<p>里斯本五日中央社電　據華盛頓電：美國務關於新國際機稱準備委員會之第一回施行委員會，於四日發表如次：國務院專家二名，爲出席聯合國安全保障理事會設置準備委員會之第一回施行委員會起見，定於下週赴倫敦，委員會決於九日舉行，預定十四國代表出席該會。</p>
<h3>土兩國　領土權爭執　可望獲得解決</h3>
<p>里斯本六日中央社電　據具魯特電訊，土耳其與　利亞兩國對獲得亞歷山大勒達Alexandretta地區領土權之爭執，將在此次土耳其外長薩加訪黎按亞　山大勒達會於一九三九年由　國　　與土耳其，而現在土耳其即已承認叙黎兩國獨立，亞歷山大勒達是應復歸叙利亞所有。茲黎巴嫩國內正準備一切，以歡迎薩加之來臨，同時各界深盼此次薩氏與黎巴嫩外長雙方交換意見後，當由獲得解決土　爭執之可能。</p>
<h3>埃及要求修正　英埃間條約　蘇丹地位與撤兵問題</h3>
<p>里斯本六日中央社電　據陸透社引開羅消息：埃及首相巴許將於今（六日）晚在上院發表演說，要求英政府修正一九三六年之英埃條約，換言之，即要求英方撤退在埃及之駐軍，與重整蘇丹之地位問題。巴氏之言辭草案，已獲得內閣之贊同。按巴許首相會於一九四二年至一九四四年間，繼績向在開羅之英國外交部提出修正上項條約之要求，現埃及之國家主義黨亦迫使巴氏要求修正該項至一九五六年始能滿期之英埃條約，實受其黨政之策勵同時全埃民衆亦熱望該條約之修正。關於要求英駐軍退出一項，巴氏之演詞中指出：「埃及在戰爭中會努力不怠，對聯合國方面之協力，亦不可謂不士。」然目今在開羅之英國官方，因戰時各項問題之糾　不淸，對此埃及當局之要求，亦未予任何斷然之答覆。一般久居於埃及之英國僑民深意爲此次戰事，已使英國與埃及之兩國聯絡更形重要，故目前埃及當局提出修正該條約之要求，亦不可謂與英國不利。關於要求英方重整蘇丹地位問題一項，埃及當局乃根據蘇丹會最埃及所征服之理由，「蘇丹應歸埃及」，至今爲埃人之口號，且在此項要求之反面，存有一種埃及人極眞實極深切之情感，蓋彼等深恐尼羅河水一旦因欲灌溉蘇丹地區而形分裂，將使全挨人民陷於困苦　饉之境。至於蘇丹土民現分成兩大黨派，一爲親埃及之埃及支特派，一爲親英之蘇丹人派，至今國際間之一切會議中，常感到蘇丹問題乃一不易解決之　手問題。</p>
<h3>兩月來之浙江（三）</h3>
<p>— 博英</p>
<p>整頓警務</p>
<p>警察負維持社會秩序，保障人民利益之責，近年以來，因物價高漲，省縣金庫又絀，警察待遇無法增加，因此迫而尋求額外收入，常有不法行爲發生，保民反以殃民，丁省長接事以來，對於浙省警察即力事整頓，從省會開始實行，整飭方法：首爲安定警察生活，自六月份起，即將省會經費，增加四分之三，對每一員警實行食糧配給，自八月份起復再度提高，每名警察月餉以三萬元爲原則，同時並嚴紀律，對車站城門輪埠之檢問警，嚴加管理，兩月來警士因留難勒索，被查明革職拘辦者，已有多起，因此目前省會方面警察勒索風氣已大形減少。關於城內秩序之確保及地痞流氓之取締等等，由省會警察局另行成立特別勤務班，專負其責。至各縣警察整頓情形，除分飭各縣切實安定員發生活，並成立警察總隊外，最近因鑒於警察人數過多，並不適合實際需要，特將各縣警察劃分爲保安警察及行政警察兩種，前者容納於警察總隊，施行集中訓練，俾養成地方武力以維地方治安，後者交由各縣縣長管轄，除一二等縣仍設警察局外，所有三等縣份，則在縣政府設科辦理，　謀警政之革新。其次如調整警察武器，普遍實施長警補習敎育等等，現正計劃次第推行，今後浙省警政，因逐步整頓必能日趨明朗也。</p>
<p>取締設卡收捐</p>
<p>浙省民衆痛苦最深者，莫若遭受軍警保安團隊之沿途設卡勒索，全省各地皆有，層層密佈，步步艱難，例以杭富公路而論，過去從杭州經凌橋家迄富陽，僅六十里之遙，勒索關卡竟有四十餘道之多，自武林門到三墩鎭，亦有十七道關卡，甚至杭州市內通衢路口，警士公然勒索小阪，已成司空見慣，共他各縣保安團隊警察檢問所等之勒索情形，自然更倍於省會，因此浙省民衆痛苦如處水深火熱之中。丁氏得悉省內此種非法勒累情形，大爲震怒，遂即下令裁撤封鎖管理處，各地檢問所，一方面並嚴禁所屬軍警及保安團隊沿途設卡收捐及非法勒索等情事，兩月以來，已見成效。</p>
<p>改進治安</p>
<p>浙省接近前線，治安情形向來欠缺良好，今春新四匪軍由　南　向浙西，治安益行退化，丁氏就任後經商請盟軍協助，並指派某某數個部隊及某某保安團隊，對新四匪軍會同進剿，第一期以打通杭州迄吳興水道公路爲目標，爲時約僅半月，即已完全打通，其時正六月底也。按杭吳水陸交通久已中斷，浙人殊感痛苦，此次竟能打通並將新四軍驅除於浙西，人民經濟種種裨益，殊非淺尠。第二期治安工作正在準備進行之中，此後擬逐期改進，以期全省治安臻於良好。</p>
<p>整頓保安團及部隊</p>
<p>浙省保安團隊就力量言，原甚雄厚，惟軍紀風紀不無可議，地方民衆因而頗感痛楚。至前節所述捐卡由保安團隊設置者，亦甚不少。丁氏以過去保安團隊及警察薪餉微薄，上級所發給薪餉，尤不够維持，設卡收捐，或其他不良情形，均不足買，　追求責任則其責任在省政府及　靖王任公署。丁氏到任，即苦心焦慮，思有以整頓，其先決條件，在省府及綏靖公署是否每月配發給養，兵警待遇，能否酌量提高，丁氏以兩個月之計劃及準備，決定分期分區整頓。第一期整頓方案，指定杭州一市，杭縣，餘杭，富腸，三縣爲區械，凡在此地區內之中央軍隊，浙省保安團隊及警察，其待遇一律提高，每名每月發餉津貼三萬元，每各發米三斗，照此實行，省庫每月須增加負祖約十萬萬元之鉅·丁氏以最大決心，盡最大責任，已定於八月一日起實行。惟丁氏以過去軍·保·警·行爲紀律欠佳，係上級不負經　及給養之責，對於過去，丁氏不僅免予斥責，及寬予宥諒，八月份起，對於杭州等地，軍·保·警之經　　養，旣由省方担負全責，嗣後絕對不准有不良行爲，設卡收捐及向民間攤派米糧奪取米糧情事。丁氏並對各方聲明上項整頓辦法，以省方能力有限，致未能全省普遍實施，祗要省方稅收增加，省庫充裕，省方能力進展，對其他各地之警察，部隊，保安團隊等亦決比照提高餉津及負担給養。現正計劃仍本分期進行之旨分別辦理云。（完）</p>

<h3>日勝野書籍官批評三國對日共同宣言　更使日戰意昂揚舉國團結</h3>
<p>上海弘報部昨（六）日下午四時，首次招待本市各報社記者，舉行報道常會，到勝野書記官、岸參事官，島田陸軍中佐等，由勝野書記官就此次波次坦會談中，美英渝對日之共同宣言等加以批評。茲分誌談話內容如次：</p>
<p>宣言動機</p>
<p>關於波次坦會談所決定之宣言，計有二點：第一，爲對日本共同宣言，冀使日本無條件降服。第二，爲對德處理問題。本人茲就敵方之希望及動戰，加以推測。關於對德處理問題，最近已有種種反響，當三頭會談之前，英美蘇各國外相曾屢次接觸，　後三國元首，復繼續會談，此可證明英美蘇三國之見不能一致，其間錯綜錯雜之情形，擊筆　書。因此波次坦會談，乃將歐洲問題作爲重點。查歐戰雖吿結束，事實上猶未完全入於停戰狀　，蓋當前歐洲之　　窮困情形，　爲　重也。而此次波次坦會議，在未發表處理德國問題之前，竟先發表對日共同宣言，可見英美蘇三國關係如何複雜。查蘇聯與日本迄今仍保守中立，美國爲先發制人起見，遂將促日降服宣言，提前發表，此乃美國一手導演之戲劇，其國內與論，亦有所批評。</p>
<p>自拉自唱</p>
<p>美國之　作主張原因何在，籃鑒於蘇聯對太平洋戰爭中立之外，復因英國前首　　吉爾　落　前，英國內民衆目覩　戰吿一段落，高唱和平，而美國則因深陷泥淖，不得不將英國牽制。在英國方面，則以過去在太平洋戰事中，協助美國，當爲不可否認之事實，故被美國任所欲爲。至重慶方面，在此項宣言中，本身未曾簽字，僅賴電訊承諾而已。因此日本對太平洋問題，認爲全係美國自拉自唱，不足重視。查重慶對美，雖有聯，惟對日宣言及處理太平洋之重要問題，僅憑宋子文之活動，放棄建議主見，足見渝本身之外交方針，已喪失實際力量。吾人今旣見所謂對日宣言。內容，與對德宣言同樣苛刻，更充分暴露美國制　世界之野心，故日本政府對此項條件，認爲在目前太平洋際情勢上，相距太遙，究全脫離現實，決置諸不理。同時該項不合理之條件，更使日本戰意昂揚，舉國一致團結，以完成作戰目的。美國發表該項宣言目的，乃欲迫使日本停戰，如今旣不能實現，反因此受到影響。</p>
<p>感想數點</p>
<p>本人　　　　下：第一，英　在對日宣言上簽字，以及此次內　改選，實由於表面上之牽涉，勢所必行，惟現今國內戰意低落，今後決難應戰，而美國因騎虎難下，非但不能獲得英國之協力，顯然負担加重，其前途可謂困難重重。第二，重慶之參預其間，直接已促成大東亞戰爭之延長。在中日和平之階段上，全面和平，已斷難實現。吾人翻閱中國百年來之歷史，無日不在排除英美之侵略，而與當前日本之大東亞作戰意義相同，但如今渝方竟一反過去之目的，廢止歷史性之理想，可見重慶本身已完全喪失外交上之自主權力，深信中國人民對中國本身復興之理想，當必起而糾正，以爭取外交之自主。基上所述，可綜合三點：　促成日本之戰意昂揚，今後作戰，更必悽烈。　美國慫恿英渝發表共同宜言，結果決難達到預定之理想。　最近渝方因政治上所採取方式，不外爲國民參政會，國民大會等，以爭取民意，如今爲美國所　制，喪失外交主力，難副一般民衆之期望，今談共本身當益遭遇困難，故渝方參加簽字共同宣言，對東亞實毫無利益。</p>

<h3>The North Pacific Enters the Operational Season: Japanese Garrison Stands Ready, U.S. Recognizes Increased Importance of Northern Japan</h3>
<p>Northern Base, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The North Pacific war front is only suitable for operations during the summer season each year. The enemy's movements on the northern front can be understood by compiling recent enemy intelligence. The enemy has deployed relatively inferior forces on this front, with only the Ninth Fleet, consisting of a few light cruisers and destroyers, as the center, and an air force mainly composed of inferior medium and small aircraft and fighters stationed at land bases. Only a part of the Pacific submarine fleet is acting up from the Midway area. This is due to the constraints of climate and other natural phenomena, and does not mean that the enemy despises the northern front. On July 10th, when the enemy mobile force attacked the Japanese mainland, it subjected Muroran to naval gun bombardment, and then dispatched a small number of mobile forces to operate in the Fukushima area. At the same time, B29 aircraft frequently conducted reconnaissance. On July 28th, incendiary bombs were dropped on Aomori City. From this, considering the possibility of B29s carrying out strategic bombing of Hokkaido and the possibility of air attacks on the Karafuto and Kuril Islands from Iwo Jima and Okinawa bases, the enemy continues to act up, centered on the Aleutian bases, which they boast as the "Northern Pearl Harbor." U.S. military reporter Baldwin commented on recent Pacific strategy, saying that in parallel with the southern operations, the offensive operation towards the Kuril Islands of Japan makes the northern front extremely important. The reasons can be listed as follows: This area has now entered the operational season. The importance of northern Japan has increased. However, the Japanese side has built a strong defensive line with elite northern army and naval forces to wait for a good opportunity to annihilate the enemy in the face of the enemy's northern offensive operations.</p>
<h3>U.S. First-Line Commander Proposes Establishing Supreme Headquarters: Pacific War Situation Gradually Reaches High Tide</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) – In recent days, there have been three important announcements regarding the Pacific War from the enemy side: 1. A joint declaration by the United Kingdom and the United States; 2. McWorcester takes control of the Ryukyu base; 3. Doolittle's proposal to establish a unified supreme command. The fundamental issue of the enemy's general attack on Japan has now been decided, as can be seen in the joint statement. The expansion of McWorcester's command authority is the initial work of the so-called "changes in region and command" in the joint statement. If the expansion of McWorcester's command authority is part of the Potsdam strategic approach, then changes will also occur in the war zone where the British General Mountbatten, who commands the Southeast Asian forces, is stationed. According to a United Press International dispatch from Washington, it is expected that the British military, in preparation for retaking Singapore and the Strait of Malacca, the only shortcut to attacking the Pacific waters, will likely place the East Indies under its own command. However, unlike the situation in Europe, no decision has yet been made on the most important issue of command authority, the establishment of a supreme command. This was not mentioned in the joint declaration on Japan. Doolittle said in a speech on Aviation Corps Memorial Day that the responsible first-line commander has put forward the idea of establishing a supreme command. He also said that Commander McWorcester has allowed the public release of the above information, which has attracted much attention. However, the U.S. Army Department in Washington declared that the above idea is not the official opinion of the Army. Well-informed sources pointed out that Doolittle is dissatisfied with the current lack of a supreme command, which has led to various difficulties, or that the higher-level authorities are issuing orders and instructions for trivial matters. Therefore, he has made the above suggestion. However, some also believe that Doolittle is quite dissatisfied with the triangular relationship between the strategic air force and the tactical air force (Kenny's Far East Air Force) and McWorcester. When we think of the fact that Doolittle's Eighth Air Force has already moved into the Okinawa base, which was originally stationed by Kenny's Air Force, we should know that the above news is not groundless.</p>
<h3>Ito Seiichi posthumously promoted to Admiral, announced by Japanese Navy Ministry</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to a statement from the Japanese Navy Ministry, during the Kamikaze operation launched in April of Showa 20 (1945) around Okinawa, Navy Vice Admiral Ito, commander of the Special Naval Attack Unit who had demonstrated the essence of the Japanese naval forces, and other officers and soldiers, sacrificed themselves for the great cause of protecting the imperial land. Therefore, the Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Combined Fleet praised their special actions and announced their deeds to the entire army. According to the Navy Ministry's announcement on the same day, Navy Vice Admiral Ito Seiichi was posthumously promoted to Navy Admiral. Admiral Ito was from Fukuoka Prefecture. He graduated from the naval academy and served as captain of the Atago and Kirishima battleships. In Showa 12 (1937), he was appointed Rear Admiral.

<h3>A Re-examination of the Kuomintang (1)</h3>
<p>— Chen Gongbo</p>
<p>The Kuomintang and Constitutionalism</p>
<p>In the spring of the 17th year of the Republic [1928], before the publication of the "Revolutionary Review", I drafted an article that was first published in the "Contribution" magazine edited by Mr. Chen Xiaguo, and later became a small booklet entitled "The Crisis of the National Revolution and Our Mistakes." At the time, it stirred the hearts of every domestic and foreign youth. The publication of that article led to the later publication of the "Revolutionary Review". That article was considered a general review of the National Revolution after the completion of the first Northern Expedition, and it was also the first review of the Kuomintang, mainly focusing on the weakness of the revolutionary forces and criticizing the Kuomintang's compromise to the environment, especially to imperialism.</p>
<p>Since then, I, your humble party member, have not written any criticisms. In the 18th year of the Republic [1929] there was the Guangzhou Uprising, and in the 19th year [1930] there was the Expanded Conference Uprising. At that time, I was busy with military affairs and had no time to discuss theory. By the time the Expanded Conference failed, I thought my cultivation was not enough, so I quietly left the country in January of the 20th year [1931] to seek self-reflection. That year, I did not participate in the Guangzhou Extraordinary Conference. On my return trip in September, when the ship passed Copenhagen, I heard about the September 18th Incident [Mukden Incident]. At that time, I was on a ship in the Indian Ocean, and I could not help but feel a myriad of emotions. That night, I wrote a poem: "On the sea, sorrowful and clear, a hundred feelings arise, Year after year of turmoil, the fighting has not ceased, I alone leave my heart and soul to the bright moon, Only in old age do I realize that I am tired of party strife." I decided not to talk about party strife anymore, and hoped to do my best to help the country. Moreover, at that time, I still wanted to rush back to Guangdong and persuade the comrades of the Extraordinary Conference to cease the conflict and seek national unity. Unexpectedly, as soon as I arrived in Hong Kong, I learned that Comrade Chen Mingshu was already running around mediating, and that the Ning and Guangdong factions could cooperate. I was truly overjoyed. Later, I joined the Nanjing government and was determined to focus on revitalizing industry. I swore not to talk about party affairs. The reorganization of the Comrades Association had already been dissolved in January of the 20th year [1931]. Even for the small factions within the party later, I only painstakingly persuaded them to eliminate their prejudices and extinguish their private interests. Later, I resigned in December of the 24th year of the Republic [1935] and still resided in Nanjing, quietly observing the situation. The first reason why I did not talk about party affairs was that I really did not want to provoke any more pointless disputes. The second reason was that the true spirit of the Kuomintang had already declined, and talking about it would not help. If I did not talk about it, perhaps I could reduce some misunderstandings and allow people to bury themselves in the work of saving the country. In this way, although it was not beneficial to the party, it might be beneficial to the country. That was my thinking at the time. At that time, many friends were criticizing me behind my back, saying that I had truly returned to England, but I still smiled and ignored them.</p>
<p>Now, the call for implementing constitutionalism and establishing public opinion institutions is still heard throughout the country. Except for the Communist Party in Yan'an, which wants to convene a People's Liberation Representative Congress with the aim of confronting Chongqing and attempting to split the country, Chongqing has a resolution to convene the National Assembly in November of this year. And under the rule of Nanjing, Peiping advocated unifying and saving the country as early as last year. In the spring of this year, the People's Representative Conference even held a general meeting in Nanjing, demanding unification and demanding the establishment of public opinion institutions. It can be seen that implementing constitutionalism and establishing public opinion institutions has become a widespread demand throughout the country.</p>
<p>Why do the people want to implement constitutionalism? Naturally, it is an expression of opposing one-party dictatorship and demanding the return of power to the people. On this point, I truly sympathize and am willing to do my best to promote it. The Republic of China has been established for 34 years, and there has never been a constitution that is adhered to by both the upper and lower levels. This is a joke and a disgrace. According to the three stages of military rule, tutelage, and constitutionalism followed by the Kuomintang, constitutionalism should have already been realized. Because I not only sympathize with the implementation of constitutionalism and the establishment of public opinion institutions, but I also more willingly promote the time for implementation and establishment.</p>
<p>The creation of the Republic of China was truly rooted in the Tongmenghui [Revolutionary Alliance], the predecessor of the Kuomintang. China was able to achieve a nominal and somewhat forced unification, truly due to the National Revolutionary Army under the Kuomintang government. However, even if the Kuomintang has contributed to the country, it cannot be said that the Kuomintang must rule the world forever. Moreover, the main reason for the establishment of the Republic of China and the completion of unification lies in the support and efforts of the entire population in order to achieve results. Therefore, one-party dictatorship is only temporary, while returning power to the people is a matter of course.</p>
<p>However, I still want to defend the Kuomintang. What is one-party dictatorship? Why do we oppose one-party dictatorship? I cannot come up with a precise answer. The demand for constitutionalism did not start today. In the 17th year of the Republic [1928], there was already a call to shorten the period of tutelage. At that time, I had an explanation for tutelage, which was that so-called tutelage should use the party's policies to guide the government, and not just use party members to control power. What I knew at the time was that no one said that the Kuomintang's political program was wrong, even if it was wrong. Even if it was wrong, the National Government at the time did not actually implement the party's policies. There is no need to say anything else, even the most moderate land law was not implemented in the Nanjing government from the 18th to the 20th year of the Republic [1929-1931]. In the Nanjing government after I joined in the 21st to 24th year of the Republic [1932-1935], it was not implemented either. So how does the opposition to tutelage actually start? To say that it is wrong to have party members in power alone, I analyzed that since the Nanjing government, there has never been an executive yuan, the highest administrative institution, where all the ministers were Kuomintang members. There were also some who were assigned representatives to participate because of military cooperation, and there were also some who only became Kuomintang members after becoming ministers. These cabinet members' words and actions were not bound by the party. Their opinions and advances and retreats were controlled by the forces behind them. I often think that the Kuomintang, which claims to be a one-party dictatorship, is not even as good as an ordinary party cabinet. What else is there to talk about? To use this to say that tutelage is inappropriate, and to oppose tutelage, I feel that it is too abrupt, ridiculous, and unreasonable.</p>
<p>But who told the Kuomintang that they did not have the courage to come up with a political program to guide the government? Who told the Kuomintang that they had no way to select party members to take power? So after a period of time, I also advocated abolishing tutelage and urgently implementing constitutionalism. As for today, we don't need to go back and re-examine the archives and argue about right and wrong. Implementing constitutionalism and establishing public opinion institutions is beyond question.</p>
<p>What will the Kuomintang be like after the implementation of constitutionalism? Some party members believe that the Kuomintang should maintain its special status, while others advocate that it should be the same as an ordinary political party. But as for me, I am not concerned about the Kuomintang's status issue, but I am solely concerned about the party's own problems. If the party itself is not sound, will the people of the whole country acknowledge that you are in a superior position and can shoulder the great responsibility of the country? This article is aimed at this problem and re-examines it. At the same time, I further declare that if constitutionalism is truly to be implemented, I am willing to advise all political parties, except for those who want to overthrow the Republic of China, to conduct self-examination. Regardless of whether they are parties and factions under the rule of Nanjing, I frankly say that there is a need for them to examine themselves in detail and with an open mind, because the interests of a political party are not its own interests, but the interests of the country. If an unsound party wants to shoulder national affairs, it will harm the people in a small way and harm the country in a big way. We should put aside politeness and be deeply vigilant.

<h3>On the Issue of Evacuation of Primary and Secondary Schools</h3>
<p>— Chen Binhe</p>
<p>On the first of this month, the Municipal Advisory Committee held a plenary meeting, and a proposal was made regarding the evacuation of primary and secondary schools. After its announcement, I heard that there are some misunderstandings circulating outside. I am making a special explanation as follows: School evacuation during wartime is a necessary measure for every country. Shanghai is a wartime city, so it cannot be an exception. Moreover, since July 17th, the city has suffered repeated air raids, and the trend is likely to intensify. In order to reduce damage, school evacuation should be prepared as early as possible. Therefore, the Advisory Committee had this proposal for discussion. In fact, this kind of suggestion is inevitable, and there is no need to explain the reasons. Moreover, logically, it should have been prepared and implemented long ago, without waiting for air raids to occur before talking about evacuation.</p>
<p>Currently, apart from schools, other organizations such as charitable groups are delaying evacuation on the pretext of poor security in the interior. In fact, although the security in remote rural areas may be slightly worse, the security in towns far from transportation lines is not as bad as generally imagined. Therefore, if schools can evacuate to towns with better security, away from the dangers of urban air raids, students' parents will certainly be happy to send their children to school there. We believe that the problem is not in the security aspect, but in the self-comforting psychology of the heads of the organizations, and the lack of a spirit of creating a new environment.</p>
<p>After the schools are evacuated, the livelihood of teachers and staff will not be difficult, because school funding will be maintained as usual, and the relocation expenses will naturally be subsidized by the municipal government. Therefore, school evacuation does not result in any losses for the schools, and has no impact on the livelihood of teachers and staff. In short, the livelihood of teachers and staff must be guaranteed.</p>
<p>On July 28th, when the Civic Welfare Association and the relevant municipal authorities held a meeting to discuss air raid relief work, Secretary-General Luo said that in order to establish hospitals for the wounded in air raids, there are currently no suitable houses, and small schools in central locations should be temporarily closed down, and the school buildings should be vacated for use as hospitals. Many attendees at the time agreed. This kind of stopgap measure to adapt to the needs of the environment is certainly acceptable, but rather than vacating the buildings and suspending classes, it is better to evacuate and relocate, and start school in another place, which is a fundamental measure. Taking a step back, it is still possible to gather students living near each other in several suitable student residences, and ask the original teachers to provide supplementary classes, so that although the school is suspended, the studies will not be interrupted.</p>
<p>When the Advisory Committee discussed this case, the attendees unanimously agreed in principle, but on the implementation, some argued that there was no immediate need for evacuation. As a result of the discussion, it was submitted to the Municipal Education Bureau for research and handling. Therefore, there are criticisms from outside that the municipal authorities and the Advisory Committee do not value education. However, we believe that this criticism is counterproductive. Our suggestion to evacuate primary and secondary schools is precisely to protect education and value education, and is by no means to destroy education. Some people also say, why only propose the evacuation of primary and secondary schools, and not discuss the evacuation of universities? Because universities are not within the scope of municipal government management. However, we have been advocating for the necessity of evacuating universities and vocational schools for several months. Not long ago (July 25th), this newspaper's editorial "Schools Should Prepare for Evacuation" specifically pointed out that universities and vocational schools should be evacuated first.</p>

The results of the Japanese army's battles on the 31st and the 1st are as follows: five barracks destroyed, one material storage depot destroyed, one truck destroyed, and over one hundred enemy soldiers killed or wounded.</p>

<h3>Inside Story of the Chongqing-Yan'an Conflict: Both Sides Devoted to a Propaganda Offensive</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report: Although Zhu De, Commander-in-Chief of the Eighteenth Group Army in Yan'an, and He Long, Commander of the Joint Defense Army of the Five Provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Jin, and Sui, have repeatedly issued circular telegrams requesting a ceasefire, Chongqing continues to increase its troop strength in the areas of Yaoxian, Chunhua, Tongguan, and Baishui, deploying a strategic posture to attack Yan'an from the southeast, west, and three directions. The Chongqing military's actions are clearly due to the increasingly intense attacks from Yan'an, and is a very forceful means adopted by the Chongqing government to suppress them. Regarding the current military conflict between Chongqing and Yan'an, according to observations from well-informed sources in Chongqing, although Chongqing's attitude is particularly tough, Chongqing is aware that the current domestic war situation is extremely unfavorable both internally and externally. Their actions do not appear to be going beyond intimidation. Yan'an is taking advantage of Chongqing to launch a propaganda offensive to seize the opportunity to develop international relations. The attitude of the Chongqing regime towards Yan'an is as follows: At this final stage of the war of resistance, they do not want to cause internal strife. Yan'an's military strength is extremely weak, and they can be annihilated in one fell swoop if necessary. Considering the current international situation, inciting civil war is extremely unfavorable. Chongqing government spokesman Zhang Pingqun also stated that political means will be used to resolve the issue. However, the Chongqing regime has been clamoring for continuing the War of Resistance against Japan for nine years. Amidst the exhaustion of the people and the decline of all industries, they vainly attempt to obtain victory through further efforts. No matter what active measures Yan'an takes, if it evolves into a civil war, the people will be plunged into deeper suffering. What's more, it may cause widespread public resentment, and the years of resistance war will be in vain. It would inevitably tarnish the Chongqing regime's reputation as a major world power by leaving the stain of "domestic disunity," sweeping away its international dignity. Therefore, they hope to resolve the Yan'an problem completely through political means and, once the War of Resistance is over, they want to eliminate Yan'an's forces in one fell swoop. Therefore, after the military conflict occurred, the Chongqing spokesman was instructed to repeatedly declare the government's intention to resolve the issue, implying action against Yan'an. Also, Zhu De and He Long were ordered to issue circular telegrams one after another, demanding that Chongqing cease fire immediately. Zhu De's telegram, regarding Chongqing's active military offensive, used a passive tone to appeal to the national populace and the international community, seeking sympathy and attempting to shift the responsibility for the conflict onto Chongqing, which is the telegram's main characteristic. One week after the telegram was sent, on July 7, He Long sent a telegram stating that if the Chongqing army further increased its military force, it would resolutely resist by assembling the military forces of the five provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, and Sui. Furthermore, Yan'an is well aware that Chongqing is currently unwilling to escalate to a full-scale civil war. Therefore, in the political arena, they continue to adhere to the establishment of a coalition government and continue to prepare to convene a people's representative assembly in the liberated areas. From the outside, both Chongqing and Yan'an are currently engaged in vigorous propaganda and are employing their respective diplomatic means. If the Chongqing government continues this state of military conflict, the upcoming Moscow talks will likely be severely affected, placing Chongqing in a difficult position.</p>
<h3>The Next Three-Headed Conference Will Be Held in Washington; Stalin Returns to Moscow</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency Electric Report) - London Reuters quoted a New York dispatch: US President Truman, on his way back to the country, stated on the cruiser "Augusta" that "he had suggested at the Potsdam Conference that the next three-power conference should be held in Washington. Regarding this suggestion, Marshal Stalin indicated that he would temporarily leave the Soviet Union to attend the conference if possible, and Prime Minister Attlee did not express any opposition."</p>
<p>Stockholm, 6th (Central News Agency Electric Report) - According to a broadcast from Moscow Radio: Soviet Supreme Commander Stalin and Foreign Minister Molotov returned to Moscow on the 5th.</p>
<p>Soviet Diplomacy Achieves Victory</p>
<p>Stockholm, 6th (Central News Agency Electric Report) - It is conceivable that Truman and Churchill originally refused Chairman Stalin's request, forcing the Soviet Union to submit to the policies of the United States and Britain. However, according to the released communique, the United States and Britain were completely controlled by the Soviet Union, and all of the Soviet Union's demands were passed. Reuters London reported on the reactions of various countries as follows:</p>
<p>Truman was eager to board the cruiser "Augusta" and return home, but before deciding to return, he used a wired radio to report the details of the meeting to the national public. Judging from his intentions, he wanted to avoid the people from questioning his concessions to Stalin. Furthermore, Sweden and France emphasized that the communique did not mention Japan at all. French journalists commented that the decisions of the Potsdam Conference would lose their meaning if the Soviet Union's attitude toward East Asian issues was not specifically stated. Furthermore, summarizing the reactions of the press in various countries: the tone of the US press is extremely common-sensical, believing that the Potsdam Declaration is a further step than the Tehran and Yalta Declarations, setting a new precedent for international peace. The French press paid close attention to France being selected as a member of the United Nations Council of Foreign Ministers, but the "Jiqi News Agency" ironically asked, "Can Attlee be qualified to be the Churchill of peace?" Spanish Broadcasting gave a detailed account of the Potsdam Communique, but did not mention the exclusion of the Franco government from the United Nations. Portuguese newspapers had the same situation as Spain, and did not mention the Franco government's abandonment at all.</p>
<p>Criticism from US Congressmen</p>
<p>Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency Electric Report) - The US Congressional diplomatic circles and the press have complex reactions to the Potsdam Declaration. Senator Connally of the Democratic Party expressed unconditional support for the declaration, but Senator Taft of the Republican Party firmly opposed the westward expansion of the Polish border, saying that this practice was the root of a new war. Therefore, there was unanimous and fierce condemnation of Truman's concession to the Soviet Union without Congressional approval. The diplomatic community believes that the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Five Great Powers is purely a dictatorship of the Great Powers' reconciliation conference, and is merely an institution that makes small countries follow suit in an exemplary manner. According to a dispatch from Chongqing's Central News Agency in Washington, the general opinion there is that the inclusion of Chongqing and France in the Council is a means to rationalize dictatorship. The press avoids mentioning that the declaration did not involve the issue of Japan, which is a sign of the failure of the Potsdam Conference. Chongqing's Central News Agency in New York reported that Truman felt particularly depressed due to the unexpected calmness in the country after returning home.</p>
<h3>United Nations Preparatory Committee to be Held in England on Thursday</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency Electric Report) - According to a Washington dispatch: The US State Department announced the following on the fourth regarding the first implementing committee of the preparatory committee for the new international organization: Two experts from the State Department are scheduled to go to London next week to attend the first implementing committee of the preparatory committee for the establishment of the United Nations Security Council. The committee is scheduled to be held on the ninth, and representatives from 14 countries are expected to attend the meeting.</p>
<h3>Territorial Disputes Between Turkey and Syria Are Expected to Be Resolved</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency Electric Report) - According to a Beirut dispatch, the territorial dispute between Turkey and Syria over the acquisition of the Alexandretta region is expected to be resolved during the visit of Turkish Foreign Minister Saka to Lebanon. Alexandretta was annexed by France to Syria and Turkey in 1939, and now that Turkey has recognized the independence of Syria and Lebanon, Alexandretta should be returned to Syria. Lebanon is preparing everything to welcome Saka's arrival, and all sectors deeply hope that after Saka and the Lebanese Foreign Minister exchange views, a resolution to the territorial dispute between Turkey and Syria will be achieved.</p>
<h3>Egypt Demands Revision of Anglo-Egyptian Treaty: Sudan Status and Troop Withdrawal Issues</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency Electric Report) - According to a Reuters dispatch from Cairo: Egyptian Prime Minister al-Basha will deliver a speech in the Senate tonight (6th), demanding that the British government revise the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936, in other words, demanding that the British withdraw their troops stationed in Egypt and reorganize the status of Sudan. Al-Basha's draft of the speech has been approved by the cabinet. Al-Basha successively submitted requests to the British Foreign Office in Cairo for the revision of the treaty from 1942 to 1944. Now, the National Party of Egypt is also forcing al-Basha to demand the revision of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, which will not expire until 1956, which is encouraged by his party's politics, and the entire Egyptian population is also eager for the treaty to be revised. Regarding the request for the withdrawal of British troops, al-Basha pointed out in his speech: "Egypt has worked tirelessly in the war, and its cooperation with the United Nations cannot be said to be unsatisfactory." However, British officials in Cairo have not given any decisive answers to the Egyptian authorities' requests due to the entanglement of various wartime issues. The long-term British expatriates in Egypt deeply believe that this war has made the connection between Britain and Egypt more important, so the Egyptian authorities' current request to revise the treaty is not unfavorable to Britain. Regarding the request that Britain reorganize the status of Sudan, the Egyptian authorities are based on the reason that Sudan was conquered by Egypt. "Sudan should belong to Egypt" has been the slogan of the Egyptians to this day, and on the other hand, there is a very real and profound emotion of the Egyptians, because they deeply fear that once the Nile water is divided to irrigate the Sudan region, the entire Egyptian people will be plunged into poverty and famine. As for the Sudanese natives, they are now divided into two major factions, one is the pro-Egyptian and Egyptian support faction, and the other is the pro-British Sudanese faction. To this day, in all international conferences, the Sudan issue is often considered an intractable issue.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang in the Past Two Months (3)</h3>
<p>— Bo Ying</p>
<p>Rectifying Police Affairs</p>
<p>The police are responsible for maintaining social order and protecting the interests of the people. In recent years, due to high prices and the shortage of provincial and county treasuries, police salaries have been unable to increase. Therefore, they have been forced to seek extra income, and illegal acts often occur. Protecting the people has instead harmed them. Since Governor Ding took office, he has vigorously rectified the police in Zhejiang Province, starting with the provincial capital. The methods of rectification are: first, to stabilize the police's lives. Since June, the provincial capital's expenses have been increased by three-quarters, and food rations have been implemented for each police officer. Since August, it has been raised again, with the principle of 30,000 yuan per month for each police officer. At the same time, strict discipline is enforced, and the inspection police at the railway station, city gate, and wharf are strictly managed. In the past two months, there have been many cases of police officers being found to have delayed and extorted, and being dismissed and arrested. Therefore, the trend of police extortion in the provincial capital has been greatly reduced. Regarding the safeguarding of order in the city and the elimination of local ruffians and hooligans, a special service team has been established by the provincial capital police bureau to be solely responsible for it. As for the rectification of police in various counties, in addition to ordering the counties to effectively stabilize the lives of the staff and establish a police headquarters, recently, in view of the excessive number of police officers, which is not suitable for actual needs, the police in various counties have been divided into two types: security police and administrative police. The former are incorporated into the police headquarters to implement centralized training, so as to develop local armed forces to maintain local security. The latter are under the jurisdiction of the county magistrates. Except for first- and second-class counties that still have police bureaus, all third-class counties have a department in the county government to handle police affairs, so as to innovate police administration. Secondly, such as adjusting police weapons, universally implementing supplementary education for police chiefs, etc., are currently being planned and implemented in order. In the future, Zhejiang's police administration will gradually become clearer due to gradual rectification.</p>
<p>Eliminating Toll Collection at Checkpoints</p>
<p>The deepest suffering of the people of Zhejiang Province is the extortion by military police and security teams along the way. It exists throughout the province, densely distributed, making every step difficult. Taking the Hangzhou-Fuyang Highway as an example, in the past, from Hangzhou through Lingqiaojia to Fuyang, a distance of only sixty li, there were as many as forty extortion checkpoints. From Wulin Gate to Sandun Town, there were also seventeen checkpoints. Even at the main intersections in Hangzhou, police officers openly extorting small banknotes has become commonplace. The extortion of other county security teams, police inspection stations, etc., is naturally more than double that of the provincial capital. Therefore, the suffering of the people of Zhejiang Province is like being in a deep fire pit. Ding was furious when he learned of this illegal accumulation of burdens in the province, and immediately ordered the abolition of the blockade management office and various inspection stations. On the one hand, he strictly prohibited the military police and security teams under his command from setting up checkpoints along the way to collect donations and illegal extortion. In the past two months, progress has been seen.</p>
<p>Improving Public Security</p>
<p>Zhejiang Province is close to the front line, and the public security situation has always been lacking. This spring, the New Fourth Bandit Army moved from southern Jiangsu to western Zhejiang, and the public security deteriorated even more. After Ding took office, he requested assistance from the Allied forces and assigned certain troops and certain security teams to jointly suppress the New Fourth Bandit Army. The first phase aimed to open the waterway highway from Hangzhou to Wuxing, which took only about half a month and was completely opened, which was at the end of June. The water and land transportation between Hangzhou and Wuxing has been interrupted for a long time, and the people of Zhejiang feel particularly painful. This time, the New Fourth Army was driven out of western Zhejiang, and the economic benefits to the people are not small. The second phase of public security work is being prepared, and it is planned to improve it in stages to make the public security in the province good.</p>
<p>Rectifying the Security Corps and Troops</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Security Corps was originally very strong in terms of strength, but the military discipline and style of work were questionable, so the local people felt quite distressed. There were also many cases where the donation cards mentioned in the previous section were set up by the security corps. Ding believes that in the past, the salaries of the security corps and police were meager, and the salaries issued by the superiors were not enough to maintain them. Setting up cards to collect donations or other undesirable situations were not enough to buy them. Pursuing responsibility means that the responsibility lies with the provincial government and the Jing Wang Gong Office. Ding was worried and anxious after taking office, thinking of how to rectify them. The prerequisite is whether the provincial government and the Pacification Commissioner's Office distribute provisions every month, and whether the treatment of soldiers and police can be appropriately improved. Ding has decided to rectify them in stages and regions with two months of planning and preparation. The first phase of the rectification plan designated Hangzhou City, Hangzhou County, Yuhang, and Fuchang as areas for mechanical rectification. The treatment of the central army, Zhejiang Security Corps, and police in this area will be improved, with a monthly salary of 30,000 yuan per person and three dou of rice per person. According to this implementation, the provincial treasury will have to increase the burden by about 100,000 yuan per month. Ding has made the greatest determination and responsibility and has decided to implement it from August 1. However, Ding believes that the military, security, and police have had poor behavior and discipline in the past, because the superiors did not bear the responsibility of Jing Ji and provisions. For the past, Ding not only exempted them from reprimand and pardoned them. From August, the Jing Ji and provisions of the military, security, and police in Hangzhou and other places have been fully borne by the province. In the future, absolutely no undesirable behavior, setting up cards to collect donations, and apportioning rice to the people will be allowed. Ding also stated to all parties that the above rectification measures could not be universally implemented throughout the province due to the limited capacity of the province. As long as the province's tax revenue increases, the province's treasury is abundant, and the province's capacity is advanced, the province will also improve the salary and provisions of the police, troops, and security corps in other places. It is currently planned to handle them separately in accordance with the purpose of proceeding in stages. (End)</p>

<h3>Japanese Secretary Katsuno Criticizes the Three-Nation Joint Declaration Against Japan, Further Encouraging Japan's Fighting Spirit and National Unity</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Hongbao Department held its first press conference yesterday afternoon (6th) at 4 p.m., inviting reporters from various newspapers in the city. Secretary Katsuno, Counselor Kishi, Lieutenant Colonel Shimada of the Army, and others attended. Secretary Katsuno criticized the joint declaration against Japan by the United States, Britain, and Chongqing in the recent Potsdam Conference. The content of the conversation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Declaration Motivation</p>
<p>Regarding the declaration decided at the Potsdam Conference, there are two points: First, the joint declaration against Japan, hoping to make Japan surrender unconditionally. Second, dealing with the German problem. I will now speculate on the enemy's hopes and combat. Regarding the handling of the German problem, there have been various reactions recently. Before the three-headed meeting, the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union had repeatedly contacted each other. Later, the heads of the three countries continued to meet. This proves that the opinions of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union cannot be consistent. The situation is complicated and confusing. Therefore, the Potsdam Conference focused on European issues. Although the European War is over, it has not yet fully entered a state of truce. After all, the current poverty situation in Europe is also very important. However, before the handling of the German problem was announced at this Potsdam Conference, the joint declaration against Japan was announced first, which shows how complex the relationship between the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union is. Since the Soviet Union and Japan have maintained neutrality until now, in order to take the lead, the United States prematurely announced the declaration to urge Japan to surrender. This is a drama directed by the United States alone, and there has been criticism in its domestic public opinion.</p>
<p>Self-pulling and Self-singing</p>
<p>What is the reason for the United States' decision-making? In addition to the Soviet Union's neutrality in the Pacific War, and because British Prime Minister - Churchill fell - before, the British people witnessed the end of the war and sang peace. The United States, however, was deeply mired in the quagmire and had to restrain Britain. On the British side, it is an undeniable fact that they assisted the United States in the Pacific war in the past, so they were allowed to do whatever they wanted by the United States. As for Chongqing, they did not sign this declaration themselves, but only relied on telegrams to promise. Therefore, Japan believes that the Pacific issue is entirely self-pulling and self-singing by the United States and is not worth paying attention to. Although Chongqing has relations with the United States, it only relies on Song Ziwen's activities to abandon suggestions and opinions on important issues such as the declaration against Japan and the handling of the Pacific, which shows that Chongqing itself has lost its actual power in its diplomatic policy. Now that we have seen the so-called declaration against Japan, the content of which is as harsh as the declaration against Germany, it fully exposes the ambition of the United States to control the world. Therefore, the Japanese government believes that these conditions are too far away from the current situation in the Pacific and are completely divorced from reality, so it decided to ignore them. At the same time, these unreasonable conditions further encouraged Japan's fighting spirit, and the entire country united to achieve the goal of combat. The purpose of the United States in issuing this declaration was to force Japan to stop the war. Now that it cannot be achieved, it has been affected as a result.</p>
<p>Several Thoughts</p>
<p>I - down: First, Britain's signing of the declaration against Japan, as well as the recent - cabinet reshuffle, was indeed due to superficial involvement, which was inevitable. However, the domestic fighting spirit is now low, and it will be difficult to fight in the future. The United States, because it is difficult to get off the tiger, not only cannot obtain Britain's cooperation, but its burden is obviously heavier, and its future can be said to be full of difficulties. Second, Chongqing's participation in the middle has directly promoted the prolongation of the Greater East Asia War. In the stage of Sino-Japanese peace, overall peace is difficult to achieve. When we review China's history of the past 100 years, there has not been a day that has not been spent eliminating the aggression of Britain and the United States, which is the same as the current significance of Japan's Greater East Asia War. However, now Chongqing has reversed its past goals and abolished historical ideals, which shows that Chongqing itself has completely lost its independent power in diplomacy. It is firmly believed that the Chinese people will surely rise up to correct the ideal of China's own revival and strive for diplomatic autonomy. Based on the above, the following three points can be summarized: It promoted Japan's fighting spirit, and the future combat will be even more tragic. The United States instigated Britain and Chongqing to issue a joint declaration, but the result will be difficult to achieve the intended ideal. Recently, the methods adopted by Chongqing in politics are nothing more than the National Political Council, the National Assembly, etc., to win public opinion. Now it is - controlled by the United States and has lost its diplomatic main force, which is difficult to meet the expectations of the general public. The current talks will inevitably encounter difficulties. Therefore, Chongqing's participation in signing the joint declaration has no benefit to East Asia.</p>
