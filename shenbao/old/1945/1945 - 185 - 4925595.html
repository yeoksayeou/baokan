<h3>日强化本土防衛體制　實施緊急運輸策　地下工廠畫夜不息增產飛機</h3>
<p>東京三日中央電社電　日政府因鑒於本土決戰愈益計劃，為發揮海陸運輸全力，於短期間內迅速實施緊急運輸，並期澈底强化北同防衛體制起見，前曾謀籌對策，頃已獲得成案。於二十九日定例閣議提案「國內戰塲化情勢下運輸緊急對策」，當由小日山運輸相加以說明，旋即通過，並決定立即實施，其內容已由日情報局於二日發表。</p>
<p>東京三日中央社電此間「讀賣新聞」記者三日於該報披露下飛機工塲之狀况如次敵機B29型雖實行極周密之偵查，終難以發現該工塲之位置，縱或判明該工塲之所在地點，但炸彈之火力，絕難達到地下之秘密工塲，此項工塲如非內部人，鮮有知者。該工塲之地道內，電炬照耀如同白晝，製造飛機之優秀機械設備整列其間，大批技術戰士均局經滙勝操作其中，身大其間，但聞機器代至軋軋聲及咽　機械之喧　聲，響成一片，使人之神經陡然緊張。地下工塲之工作，無瞬時之停止，業已完成之部份品，即由運貨汽車盤繞幾重山岳，運往另一地下工塲。記者曾立於該地下工塲出口，目覩運貨汽車裝載資材進內，此外山谷間或山上更有許多裝配工塲，每一飛機之製成，必經數工場之分工合作，故運貨車往來極形忙碌，或有人力肩荷此項部份品。因此工塲之生產能率不斷增加，如本月份爲×十架，下月目標則巳遞增至×百架，不論敵機如何搜尋與熾烈轟炸，日本之飛機生產率仍日趨上昇云。</p>
<h3>峇厘巴板日軍　擊退敵攻勢　日機隊襲艦船收穫戰果</h3>
<p>峇厘巴板三日中央社電於峇厘巴板海岸地帶登陸之敵軍，已築成浮碼頭，起卸兵員及資材，更由戰鬥及轟炸約百五十架之掃射及轟炸，及艦船射擊之掩護下，出動戰車十餘輛爲先鋒，逐次前進，日守備隊則以肉搏戰法及施行夜襲反攻，將敵壓迫至海岸地帶，同時炸毀敵重戰車及中型戰車各一輔，物資積集所一處，使敵陣陷於混亂後，全員平安歸還防地。</p>
<p>南方基地三日中央社電上月二十五日陸軍新銳攻擊隊七生隊，攻擊峇厘巴板洋上敵艦船之戰果、據其後調査結果，一日確認綜合戰果如次：炸沉巡洋艦或大型驟逐艦二艘。大型驅逐艦一艘，驅逐艦或掃海艇一艘，共計四艘，擊沉二萬噸油　船一艘。巡洋艦或大型驅逐艦一艘。艦型不詳者二艘，共計四艘。</p>
<h3>敵大型機　侵襲熊本市</h3>
<p>福罔三百中央社電二日下午二時半左右，有敵大型機十七架，似由冲繩基地飛來，由鹿兒島甑島附近侵入熊本市，在該市四週天空盤旋後，經天草向南逸去。</p>
<p>大阪三日中央社電敵B29型機五十架，於二日下午十一時五十分左右，飛經三重縣中部及琵琶湖附近，在若狹灣佯作行動後，後飛往福非。歧　兩縣境，侵入東海軍管區。又另批B29型二十五架，由同時刻迄翌三日零時五十分左右，分散由四國東海道北進，于和歌山縣海南市西南方地區投彈，旋經奈良縣南部逐次向南方洋上逸去，因此上述各處一部發生火災，迄三日正午已行熄滅，蒙害極爲輕微。</p>
<h3>滿洲贈豆醬　慰問日災民</h3>
<p>浦和三日中央社電滿張國務總理贈送日本慰問戰災人民之大豆，頃已奉日農商省指示，以大豆製成日本醬，贈給戰災地區災民。浦和市全國食　統制會社接受命令後，遂立即令各地統制會社通知各零賣商店，本月一個月內以配給醬免費配給各戰災人民。</p>
<h3>沖繩周圍海面　猛攻艦船羣　日航空隊施衝撞戰術</h3>
<p>琉球基地三日中央社電日軍航空部隊一日晨曾對冲繩周圍之敵艦船羣加以猛襲，並對敵輸送船驅逐艦及艦種不詳者共三艘，敢行銜　攻擊。又二日晨日軍航空部隊復繼向該方海域出動，攻擊敵艦船羣。</p>
<p>前綫基地三日中央</p>
<p>社電　日航空獨對由一日夜迄二日曉，分數次　伊江島敵機場及沖繩本島南端四周之敵艦船羣，擊沉巡艦一艘，又發射魚雷命中另一巡艦。日航空部隊此次攻擊伊江島，該方面各處已為烈火包圍，為時極久。</p>
<h3>蘇聯國內復興問題</h3>
<p>歷時五年又八個月的歐洲大戰，現已吿終。歐洲方而的焦點，已移向政治問題。其主要角色，當然是蘇聯。蘇聯今後將置重點於何處呢？她將如何行動呢？這點實在是世人最關心的。今日最受聯當局注意的，就是蘇聯的國內復興問題。</p>
<p>山於德蘇兩國的血鬥，歐俄西部的烏克蘭固不必說，就是遠至伏爾加河畔及高加索中部，也已受到戰火的洗禮。蘇聯三次五年計劃的成就，因而大半化爲烏有。不過，我們必知道，蘇聯早巳將重要工廠　至東部地方，迅速建設新的工業地帶，這事雖然很費周折，却也由此確保紅軍抗戰力的源泉。蘇聯國內，復興和再建的　聲，早就高响入雲，希望實現比戰前史好的建設事業。對於致力國內復興工作的蘇聯，美國用種種手段加以威嚇，例如宣布不參加對日戰爭國家，停止貸與武器呀，削減租借蘇聯軍火數量呀，減少七十萬萬美元借款額呀等等，一面復用物質的援助爲香餌，在威逼利誘的方式下，以謀實現其本身的政治目的。所以蘇聯的國內復興問題，不單是蘇聯自己的問題，還與國際政局有關，是具有相常重要性的</p>
<p>茲由這種見地，將英國「經濟學家」雜誌最近一期上所載「蘇聯的再建」，以及傳到斯德哥爾學的種種關於蘇聯復興問題的消息，綜合　述於後。</p>
<p>洪水與煤田</p>
<p>戰前，鳥克蘭的頓巴斯煤田地帶，是蘇聯首屈一指的煤田，也是她的重工業地帶。德蘇開戰以後，該地曾在德軍手中約一年半。一九四三年二月，紅軍奪回該地時，那邊沒有一塊乾土，因爲德軍退走之際，掘斷結冰的河川，破壞其堤防，將泥水「配給」頓巴斯全區。共水量之多，估計達三萬五千萬立方米。如以每日抽乾一百萬立方米計算，一年後方可抽去六千萬立方米。蘇聯當時因爲抽永帮浦不够，所以未能迅速進行此項工作。然而，全部煤坑坑逍，長約四百餘公里，到去年十月正，其中已有七五％（即三百公里）的坑道業已抽乾污水。蘇聯常局期望到去年年底止，能够恢復煤產量至戰前的三分之一，唯未做到。</p>
<p>重工業恢復</p>
<p>有名的　無產地克里伏洛格（烏克國境內），也與頓巴斯一樣，　部埋於泥水中。克里伏洛格的鐵　產量，戰前佔蘇聯總產額的五〇，六〇%，與頓巴斯同為蘇聯重工業的要地。該　區的排水工作，直到去年年底，僅完成了一○%。恢復頓巴斯與克里伏洛格，對於蘇聯當局，實爲目前的急務，現正力謀重建。至其所需勞動力，則仰賴烏拉爾。西伯利亞。中央亞細亞各地方，並且使用德軍俘虜。</p>
<p>烏克蘭各地的冶金業工廠及其機械，在開戰以還一年餘間，相繼遷往柬部地方，但在德軍撤退後不久，即於廢墟中重建應急的工廠，開始工作。他如哈里司夫火軍頭工廠，以及伏羅希洛夫格勒的各工廠，均已再行開工。又，斯太林格勒大戰時，曾爲德蘇兩軍死　之處的牽引車工廠，亦已開工。這些業已恢復的工廠，生產額如何，其詳細情形不得而知。但據哈里可夫工業計畫委員會發表，東部地方的工業生產額，遠較戰前爲高。例如鋼板鋼條的產量，如以戰前的一九四〇年爲一〇〇，則一九四三年爲一一一，計增一一%。此即過去三年餘中，蘇聯當局集中全力培養東部地方的結果。烏拉爾的地區別生產指數約七。八倍於戰前。</p>
<p>由於東部地方的發展，一度低落的蘇聯工業生產，逐漸　昇。據電工業委員長卡業可夫稱，蘇聯重工業生產額，去年已勝過戰前，並有許多工廠已開始生產一部分民需物資。又傳蘇聯最近致力製造農業用機械，牽引車等的產量，以本年度二倍戰前爲目漂。</p>
<p>與工業生產不可分離的電力，蘇聯也希望恢復戰前的水準，現正努力建立新發電廠，並修理戰時被害各廠。例如特聶伯大發電廠，原係紅軍退走時自行破壞者，目下正在積極修理整頓。據最近出版的「布爾雪維克」雜誌發表：「去歲開始發電的各廠，發電量約與第一次五年計劇時同，總發電力計爲二百乃至二百五十萬基羅瓦特。烏克鬧境內，因所有發電廠悉遭破壞，電力尙難足敷應用。」</p>
<p>今後之動向</p>
<p>正在復興途上的蘇聯礦工業，最近顯現兩種新傾向。其一是東部地方的生產額漸呈低調。此因戰爭一近結東時，從烏克蘭及共他地方遷往東部的勞工，開始希望歸還故鄉者，爲數甚多，以致不能專心工作，生產力因而大受影響。此外，德蘇戰爭中，蘇聯的人力損失極鉅，問題相當深刻。其二則爲軍需生產改爲民需生產。蘇聯的民需物資，雖說極度節約，不致發生美國那樣的嚴重問題，然在戰後强令國民過分犧牲生活上的享受，究屬不行。對於這種問題，克里姆林將如何處置呢？</p>
<p>對內，有國內重建問題正待解決；對外，則國際政局已極複雜微妙，在這種境遇下的蘇聯，其今後的動向，是値得注意的。（譯自每日新聞）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>疏散遊民</h3>
<p>本市疏散工作，近正積極推進，例如慈善團體之疏散，曾再三勸吿並決定協助辦法，强制疏散。而我們認爲今日急須設法疏散的，尙有本市的遊民。</p>
<p>所謂遊民，是指本市一部份無正當職業，無一定住所的遊蕩份子，包括壯年流氓，男女乞丐，老幼難民，流浪兒童等等。遊民不事生產，但是他們的生活却不能不由生產者担負，成爲本市食糧等物資一大消耗者，這還是指一般比較良善的遊民而言。但是共中尙有不少品性惡劣的，如吸用毒物者，竊盜路刧之慣行犯，更有彼此勾結而形成地方秘密惡勢力者，實爲危書社會治安的主要因素，也就是革新社會風氣的主要障碍。至於一般遊民之無公德行爲，如沿街便溺，偸竊及破壞公共設施，剝取行人道樹皮，搶劫婦　物品，以及傳播疫苗妨礙公共衛生等等，更是破壞社會秩序，不僅有礙市容觀瞻而已。</p>
<p>疏散本市游民之迫急需要，已如上述，但在實施時有幾點必須注意：　必須澈底，使狡點者無法逃避疏散。　使惡劣份子受嚴格訓練及管理，漸使轉向正道。　不是過去慈善團體消極救濟而是積極的使成爲生產份子，以期能自食其力，更進而有助於社會。</p>
<p>在以上這種要求之下，我們認為在疏散木市游民的具體辦法方面，有以下幾點値得加以考慮：</p>
<p>第一，實施疏散本市遊民工作，應由本市遊民勞動營主辦，集中遊民，原爲勞動營之任務，並由疏散委員會及警察當局派警協助。</p>
<p>第二，疏散地點須有荒地可資　植者，或有手工業生產之條件者，如浦東之橫沙島等，使本市遊民疏散至新地點後，壯年可使耕地種植，婦女可使從事小工藝，一律變成生產份子，逐漸做到自食其力的地步。對於兒童，更當施以國民義務敎育。即成年亦當按時予以適當的技術敎育及社會敎育。以期在一定期間之後一律化爲生產公民。</p>
<p>第三，在舉辦此項疏散時，急需解決的，尙有經費和人才二項。前者當由政府及市民中之有力份子　力　措，後者希望各慈　團體，敎會及學校方而有志者自動挺身，參加服務。</p>
<h3>蘇省府調查　行政機構　建廳添設兩科</h3>

<p>省垣各界大會盛況</p>
<p>蘇州三日中央社電蘇省憲政軍學工商各界，前日上午在省府大禮堂舉行淸鄕四週年紀念大會，出席各機關長官職員。及各界民衆團體代表等五千餘人，在蘇友邦方面亦派代表參加。首由主席任省長報告淸鄉工作之重要性，及本省四年來淸鄉之經過，指斥共熱禍國殃民之慘烈，而强調淸鄕就是反共之意義，要求一致協力。繼由省黨部代表顧天錫致詞，說明淸鄕工作之歷史性，及今後爾淸反動份子的必耍等，至十一時許始行散會。戰時省府宣傳團並公演話劇「回頭是岸」，觀衆極爲擁擠，全城各商店住戶均　掛國旗，以示慶祝，情况極爲熱烈。</p>
<h3>實部對滬工廠　决定供煤配電　大量運煤來滬增發電量</h3>
<p>南京三目中央社電實業部以上海一般民需工廠，大都因電力不足，陷於停頓，爲挽救垂危之工業起見，決定由煤礦增產督導委員會每月大量運煤赴滬，供給華中水電公司，俾增加發電量，統籌配給上海各重耍工廠。現此項供煤配電辦法，該部業與各有關方而接洽就緒，不日即可見諸實施。茲將該辦法　　如下：　實業部煤礦增產督導會（以下簡稱委員會）儘量運煤供給華中水電公司（以下簡稱公司）　公司收到上項供煤，應於每月二十五日以前計算可能配電數量通知實業部，由實業部統　配給工作，列表通知公司，公司接到通知後，應迅耶依照發電。　公司配電量，依照分析結果，隨時決定煤質分析，由委員會與公司合同指定　關辦理。　煤價由公司照配給價，付與委員會，如不敷成本，由委員會逕飭受配電力工廠補償之。　公司仍向受配電力工廠，照章收取電費。</p>

<h3>宣部變更　辦公時間</h3>
<p>南京三日中央社電宣傳部當局頃以時届暑令，氣候突熱，特將辦公時間，改變每日上午八時起至中午一時止，下午休息。</p>
<h3>美渝關係微妙</h3>
<p>中央社訊據滬市方面消息：上月二十日美駐渝大使哈萊與美在渝總司令韋特曼，忽發表聯合聲明。此項聲明之發表。實含有錯綜複雜之原因。蓋哈萊大使爲擁護渝政權者，當其在任返國述職時，曾發表談話支持重慶，主張美援渝軍火不能供給延安。惟韋特曼則同情延安，非獨主張承認共黨所盤踞之區，並主張承認邊區政府，冀融洽國民黨與共黨之軍事力量。至於對美助渝之軍火，則聲稱不能供內戰之用。因此二人意見不合，　擦頗力。哈萊大使有鑒於斯爲謀調整美在渝不統一之外交現象，乃不得不與韋發表所　聯合聲明，但因此復引起中共之抨擊。據延安新華社所稱，哈萊爲帝國主義者，重慶爲獨裁政治，且指哈萊不明民主義之眞諦，將來勢必干涉中國內政，故最近中共抨　渝美，屢見不鮮。回顧美國過去援助中共，其目的爲牽制重慶，嗣渝政權接行美國，美乃放棄援共而合力支持重慶，可見其中關係頗爲微妙，而渝美之關係亦可見一斑。</p>
<h3>三頭會議期近　會塲佈置中　「仲夏宮」已整飭一新</h3>
<p>瑞典京城三日中央社電　據路透社外交訪員稱：在未來之三頭會議中英美蘇三國均未知孰主孰賓，然倫敦各界州深信該項會議舉行之地點，必將成爲三國軍警嚴密防衛之區，同時在會議期內，各國將實行自我防衛。又據報吿，略謂，會議時需要一切佈置，現正進行調排中。波資坦之「仲夏宮」亦已爲整飾一新，然據一般對於會塲佈置具有深切經騐之技術人員宣稱，「聖沙西皇宮」將較「仲夏宮」更爲適合，按「聖沙西皇宮」曾爲弗立德烈克君皇避暑之處，且曾在該宮內接見當時世界聞名之貴客「伏爾太安」。</p>
<h3>渝與哥斯達黎加　訂友好條約</h3>
<p>廣州三日中央社電據重慶中央社電；重慶當局發表謂，渝方與哥斯達黎加間友好條約，業於六月二十五日在哥斯達黎加首都聖約瑟，交換批准文書，渝任命涂允禮爲駐哥斯達黎加公使，同時哥國內長紫特任駐渝特派使節。</p>
<h3>特魯曼促國會　批准新憲章</h3>

<p>里斯本三日中央社電據華盛頓電：特魯曼自就任大總統後，曾任命閣僚五名，共中四名業於一日就職。其新閣僚陣容如下：勞動部長許威雷巴（前參院議員兼聯邦地方法院推事）。農務部長安特遜（前民主黨衆院職員）。郵務部長哈納根（民主黨全國委員長）。檢察廳長克拉克（前檢察廳次長），除以上四名外，即爲新受任命之國務卿彭斯，目前十名閣僚中，半數爲特曼任命之閣僚。</p>
<h3>蘇要求參加　巴黎會議　研討丹吉爾問題</h3>
<p>里斯三日中央社電據駐巴黎之路透社訪員金氏談稱；蘇聯當局茲突提出要求參加討論將來丹吉爾地位問題之英。美。法三國會議，致使定於今日在巴黎召開會談之計劃，遭遭莫大之阻碍。按此項要求，乃由蘇聯大使巴高莫洛夫於週末夜提交與法外長貝多爾特。</p>
<h3>巴拿馬宣布　對西絕交</h3>
<p>里斯本三日中央社電巴拿馬二日電：巴拿馬政府頃因弗朗哥政權下之西班牙外交政策，違反聯合國利益及民主主義原則，故決對西政府斷絕國交，業於三十日以大總統命令公佈。</p>
<h3>英美對中立國繼續經濟封鎖</h3>
<p>蘇黎世三日中央社電據紐約電：美國工業機關報發表謂，美國務院曾聲明英美兩國今後仍然繼續封鎖各中立國之經濟。至英美兩國採取該項揹置之目的，係在防止復興歐洲之物資大量流人瑞士瑞典及葡萄牙等中立國。</p>

<h3>中儲特殊本票　規定支付辦法　得與其他票據同樣轉帳交換</h3>
<p>財政當局爲穩定上海整個金融，取締貼現惡風，及金融機關開發　款單流　起見，業由中央儲備銀行召集銀錢兩業同業公會負責人硏商結果，決定於昨（三）日起，中儲指定之六十四家交換銀行及銀錢兩業準備會庫會員行莊，一律停止開發支中儲銀行及銀聯會與錢準庫之撥款單，改用支付客存，在可能範圍內支付現鈔，絕對禁止行莊再有貼現行爲。茲悉中央儲備銀行特殊木票，規定支付辦法爲：　中央儲備銀行特殊本票，得背書轉帳，與其他票據同樣交換。　中央儲備銀行特殊木票，得補充當日交換頭寸。　中央儲備銀行特殊木票，由金融機關持向中央儲備銀行收取時，得申說理由，領取現鈔。</p>
<p>行莊本票愼重開發</p>
<p>本市銀錢兩業之半年決算例假期滿，業於昨（三）日起照常營業，銀錢業已遵中儲當局之命，於昨日起已停止使用撥款單。　行莊停止開發，祗可收進，不准流出。　存戶向行莊提取鉅額現鈔，不得已時始於絕對愼重下，開發本票。客戶凡執有本票者，務須遵守十日以內提示之限期。據悉行莊之本票，係專供客戶使用，其同業間對銀聯會錢準庫，則可使用轉賬申請書，行莊對會庫有存款者，方准照辦，此舉對於防止開發空頭本票，頗有意義。</p>
<p>支付現鈔略見寬鬆</p>
<p>中儲當局以本月三日起，撥款單停用後，現鈔需要定將迫切，乃特別供給銀錢兩業之現鈔頭寸，於上月廿九日起，銀行業領用現鈔已達三十萬萬元左右，錢莊業領用現鈔已達十萬萬元以上，故昨日各銀行錢莊，對各客戶支取存款，所付予之現鈔數額，已較以前略見寬鬆。此後倘行莊方面一木協力戰時金融熱忱，所領有之現鈔不再營求貼現之不法利得，則現鈔恐慌，當可逐步解決。</p>

        <h1>1945 - n185</h1>
<h3>Japan Strengthens Homeland Defense System: Implement Emergency Transportation Plan, Underground Factories Increase Aircraft Production Day and Night</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd - Central News Agency - In view of the increasing plans for a decisive battle on the homeland, the Japanese government, in order to fully utilize sea and land transportation, is rapidly implementing emergency transportation within a short period of time. Furthermore, in order to thoroughly strengthen the northern defense system, countermeasures have previously been planned and have now been approved. At the regular cabinet meeting on the 29th, the proposal "Emergency Countermeasures for Transportation under Domestic Battlefield Conditions" was submitted. Transportation Minister Koyamada explained it, and it was immediately passed, and it was decided to implement it immediately. The content was announced by the Japanese Information Bureau on the 2nd.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd - Central News Agency - A reporter from the "Yomiuri Shimbun" here disclosed the condition of an aircraft factory in the newspaper on the 3rd as follows: Although enemy B-29 aircraft conduct extremely thorough reconnaissance, it is ultimately difficult to discover the location of the factory. Even if the location of the factory is identified, the firepower of bombs can never reach the secret underground factory. Few people know about this factory unless they are internal personnel. Inside the underground factory, electric torches illuminate the area as if it were daytime. Excellent machinery and equipment for manufacturing aircraft are neatly arranged, and a large number of skilled technicians are diligently operating them. Inside, one only hears the creaking sound of machines and the noisy hum of machinery, creating a cacophony that makes one's nerves tense. The work in the underground factory never stops for a moment. The completed parts are transported by freight trucks winding through several mountains to another underground factory. The reporter stood at the exit of the underground factory and witnessed freight trucks loaded with materials entering. In addition, there are many assembly factories in the valleys or on the mountains. The production of each aircraft requires the division of labor and cooperation of several factories, so freight trucks are extremely busy going back and forth, and some parts are carried by manpower. As a result, the production efficiency of this factory is constantly increasing. For example, this month's output is × tens of aircraft, and next month's target has already increased to × hundreds of aircraft. No matter how enemy aircraft search and bombard intensely, Japan's aircraft production rate is still increasing daily.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Balikpapan Repel Enemy Offensive; Japanese Air Force Attacks Ships and Achieves Results</h3>
<p>Balikpapan, 3rd - Central News Agency - Enemy troops landing on the coast of Balikpapan have built floating docks to unload troops and supplies. Under the cover of strafing and bombing by about 150 fighter and bomber aircraft, and shelling from warships, they advanced gradually with more than ten tanks as the vanguard. The Japanese garrison used melee combat tactics and conducted night counterattacks, forcing the enemy back to the coastal area. At the same time, they destroyed one enemy heavy tank and one medium tank, and a materials accumulation point, causing chaos in the enemy's position. All personnel returned safely to their defensive positions.</p>
<p>Southern Base, 3rd - Central News Agency - The results of the attack on enemy warships off Balikpapan by the Army's elite 7th Life Attack Unit on the 25th of last month, according to a subsequent investigation, have been confirmed as follows: Two cruisers or large destroyers sunk. One large destroyer sunk. One destroyer or minesweeper sunk, for a total of four ships. One 20,000-ton oil tanker sunk. One cruiser or large destroyer damaged. Two ships of unknown type damaged, for a total of four ships damaged.</p>
<h3>Enemy Large Aircraft Raids Kumamoto City</h3>
<p>Fukuoka, 3rd - Central News Agency - Around 2:30 PM on the 2nd, 17 enemy large aircraft, apparently flying from Okinawa base, entered Kumamoto City from the vicinity of Koshikijima Island in Kagoshima. After circling the sky around the city, they headed south via Amakusa.</p>
<p>Osaka, 3rd - Central News Agency - Fifty enemy B-29 aircraft flew over the central part of Mie Prefecture and the vicinity of Lake Biwa around 11:50 PM on the 2nd, feigning action in Wakasa Bay, and then flew to the borders of Fukui and Gifu prefectures, intruding into the Tokai Military District. Another group of 25 B-29 aircraft, from the same time until about 12:50 AM on the 3rd, dispersed and advanced northward from Shikoku and Tokaido. They dropped bombs in the southwestern area of Kainan City in Wakayama Prefecture, and then gradually headed south over the sea via the southern part of Nara Prefecture. As a result, fires broke out in some of the aforementioned areas, which were extinguished by noon on the 3rd, and the damage was very minor.</p>
<h3>Manchuria Donates Soybean Paste to Comfort Japanese Disaster Victims</h3>
<p>Urawa, 3rd - Central News Agency - The soybeans donated by Manchurian Prime Minister Zhang Jinghui to comfort Japanese people affected by the war disasters have recently been instructed by the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce to be processed into Japanese miso (soybean paste) and distributed free of charge to disaster victims in the affected areas. After receiving the order, the National Food Control Company in Urawa City immediately instructed the control companies in various regions to notify retail stores to distribute the miso free of charge to war disaster victims for one month this month.</p>
<h3>Fierce Attacks on Ship Groups in Seas Around Okinawa; Japanese Air Force Employs Kamikaze Tactics</h3>
<p>Ryukyu Base, 3rd - Central News Agency - The Japanese military air force launched a fierce attack on enemy ship groups around Okinawa on the morning of the 1st, daringly engaging in body-crashing attacks on enemy transport ships, destroyers, and three ships of unknown type. On the morning of the 2nd, the Japanese military air force again launched an attack on enemy ship groups in the same waters.</p>
<p>Frontline Base, 3rd - Central News Agency - From the night of the 1st to the dawn of the 2nd, the Japanese Air Force repeatedly attacked enemy airfields on Ie Island and enemy ship groups around the southern end of Okinawa Island, sinking one cruiser and hitting another cruiser with a torpedo. The Japanese Air Force's attack on Ie Island caused various areas to be enveloped in flames for a long time.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union's Domestic Reconstruction Problem</h3>
<p>The European war, which lasted for five years and eight months, has now come to an end. The focus in Europe has shifted to political issues. The main role, of course, is the Soviet Union. Where will the Soviet Union place its emphasis in the future? How will she act? This is what the world is most concerned about. What is receiving the most attention from the Allied authorities today is the Soviet Union's domestic reconstruction problem.</p>
<p>Due to the bloody battles between Germany and the Soviet Union, not to mention Ukraine in western European Russia, even areas as far as the Volga River and central Caucasus have been ravaged by war. The achievements of the Soviet Union's three Five-Year Plans have therefore largely been reduced to nothing. However, we must know that the Soviet Union had long ago moved important factories to the eastern regions, rapidly building new industrial zones. Although this was very troublesome, it also ensured the source of the Red Army's resistance. Within the Soviet Union, the call for restoration and reconstruction has long resounded to the heavens, hoping to realize construction projects better than before the war. The United States is using various means to threaten the Soviet Union, which is devoting itself to domestic reconstruction, such as announcing that it will stop lending weapons to countries that do not participate in the war against Japan, reducing the amount of military supplies leased to the Soviet Union, and reducing the loan amount of 7 billion US dollars, etc. On the one hand, it uses material assistance as bait, using coercion and inducement to achieve its own political goals. Therefore, the Soviet Union's domestic reconstruction problem is not only the Soviet Union's own problem, but also related to the international political situation, and is of considerable importance.</p>
<p>From this point of view, we will comprehensively describe "The Soviet Union's Reconstruction," which was published in a recent issue of the British "Economist" magazine, as well as various news about the Soviet Union's reconstruction problem that has been transmitted to Stockholm.</p>
<p>Floods and Coalfields</p>
<p>Before the war, the Donbas coalfield area in Ukraine was the Soviet Union's leading coalfield and its heavy industry zone. After the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, the area was in German hands for about a year and a half. When the Red Army recaptured the area in February 1943, there was not a single piece of dry land there, because when the Germans retreated, they cut off the frozen rivers, destroyed their dikes, and "distributed" mud and water to the entire Donbas area. The total amount of water is estimated at 350 million cubic meters. If one million cubic meters are pumped out every day, 60 million cubic meters can be pumped out after one year. At that time, the Soviet Union did not have enough pumping equipment, so it was unable to carry out this work quickly. However, of the entire coal mine tunnels, which are about 400 kilometers long, 75% (i.e., 300 kilometers) of the tunnels had already been pumped dry of water by October last year. The Soviet authorities hoped to restore coal production to one-third of the pre-war level by the end of last year, but this was not achieved.</p>
<p>Heavy Industry Recovery</p>
<p>The famous ore-producing area of ​​Krivoy Rog (within Ukraine), like the Donbas, was also completely buried in mud and water. Before the war, Krivoy Rog's iron ore production accounted for 50-60% of the Soviet Union's total output, and like the Donbas, it was an important place for the Soviet Union's heavy industry. By the end of last year, only 10% of the drainage work in the area had been completed. For the Soviet authorities, restoring the Donbas and Krivoy Rog is a matter of urgent priority, and they are now striving to rebuild them. The labor force required for this relies on the Urals, Siberia, and Central Asia, and also uses German prisoners of war.</p>
<p>Metallurgical factories and their machinery in various parts of Ukraine were successively moved to the eastern regions during the year or so after the outbreak of the war, but soon after the German troops withdrew, makeshift factories were rebuilt in the ruins and began operations. Other factories, such as the Kharkiv fire engine factory and the factories in Voroshilovgrad, have also been reopened. Also, the tractor factory in Stalingrad, which was the site of fierce fighting between the German and Soviet armies during the Battle of Stalingrad, has also been put back into operation. The detailed situation of the production volume of these restored factories is unknown. However, according to the Kharkov Industrial Planning Committee, the industrial production volume in the eastern regions is much higher than before the war. For example, if the production of steel plates and steel bars in 1940 before the war is taken as 100, then it was 111 in 1943, an increase of 11%. This is the result of the Soviet authorities concentrating all their efforts on developing the eastern regions in the past three years. The regional production index of the Urals is about seven or eight times higher than before the war.</p>
<p>Due to the development of the eastern regions, the Soviet Union's industrial production, which had once declined, gradually increased. According to Electric Industry Committee Chairman Kabykov, the Soviet Union's heavy industry production volume last year exceeded that before the war, and many factories have begun to produce some consumer goods. It is also reported that the Soviet Union has recently been striving to manufacture agricultural machinery, with the goal of doubling the production of tractors, etc., this year compared to before the war.</p>
<p>Electricity, which is inseparable from industrial production, is also something the Soviet Union hopes to restore to pre-war levels. It is now working hard to build new power plants and repair those that were damaged during the war. For example, the Dnipro Hydroelectric Station, which was originally destroyed by the Red Army when it retreated, is currently being actively repaired and reorganized. According to the recently published "Bolshevik" magazine: "The power generation of the plants that started generating electricity last year is about the same as during the First Five-Year Plan, with a total power generation of 2 million to 2.5 million kilowatts. Within Ukraine, because all power plants were destroyed, it is still difficult to meet the demand for electricity."</p>
<p>Future Trends</p>
<p>The Soviet mining industry, which is on the road to recovery, has recently shown two new trends. The first is that the production volume in the eastern regions is gradually declining. This is because, as the war nears its end, many workers who moved from Ukraine and other places to the east begin to hope to return to their hometowns, resulting in an inability to concentrate on work, and productivity is greatly affected. In addition, the Soviet Union's human losses during the German-Soviet war were extremely large, and the problem is quite profound. The second is the conversion of military production to civilian production. Although it is said that the Soviet Union's consumer goods are extremely frugal and will not cause problems as serious as those in the United States, it is still not feasible to force the people to excessively sacrifice their enjoyment of life after the war. How will the Kremlin deal with this problem?</p>
<p>Domestically, there is the problem of domestic reconstruction to be solved; externally, the international political situation is extremely complex and delicate. Under these circumstances, the Soviet Union's future trends are worth paying attention to. (Translated from Mainichi Shimbun)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Dispersing Vagrants</h3>
<p>The evacuation work in this city has recently been actively promoted. For example, the evacuation of charitable organizations has been repeatedly advised and a decision has been made to assist in the evacuation by compulsory means. However, we believe that what urgently needs to be evacuated today are the vagrants in this city.</p>
<p>The so-called vagrants refer to a group of wandering elements in this city who have no legitimate occupation and no fixed residence, including adult hooligans, male and female beggars, old and young refugees, wandering children, etc. Vagrants do not engage in production, but their lives cannot but be borne by producers, becoming a major consumer of food and other materials in this city. This still refers to the more benign vagrants in general. However, there are also many who are of bad character, such as drug users, habitual thieves and robbers, and even those who collude with each other to form local secret evil forces, which are the main factors endangering social security and the main obstacles to reforming social customs. As for the lack of public morality of ordinary vagrants, such as urinating and defecating in the streets, stealing and damaging public facilities, stripping bark from roadside trees, robbing women of their belongings, and spreading vaccines to obstruct public health, etc., these are all disruptions to social order, which not only harm the appearance of the city.</p>
<p>The urgent need to disperse the vagrants in this city is as mentioned above, but there are several points that must be paid attention to during implementation: It must be thorough, so that cunning individuals cannot escape the evacuation. Strict training and management must be imposed on the unscrupulous elements to gradually turn them to the right path. It is not a passive relief effort by past charitable organizations, but rather an active effort to make them productive members, so that they can support themselves and further contribute to society.</p>
<p>Under these requirements, we believe that the following points are worth considering in terms of specific measures for dispersing the vagrants in Mushi:</p>
<p>First, the work of dispersing the vagrants in this city should be organized by the Municipal Vagrant Labor Camp, concentrating the vagrants, which is the task of the labor camp, and assisted by the dispersal committee and the police authorities.</p>
<p>Second, the dispersal location must have wasteland available for cultivation, or conditions for handicraft production, such as Hengsha Island in Pudong, so that after the vagrants in this city are dispersed to the new location, adults can cultivate land and women can engage in small crafts, all becoming productive members, gradually achieving self-sufficiency. Children should be given national compulsory education. Even adults should be given appropriate technical education and social education on a regular basis, so that they can all be transformed into productive citizens after a certain period of time.</p>
<p>Third, in organizing this dispersal, the urgent issues to be resolved are funding and talent. The former should be raised jointly by the government and influential people among the citizens, and the latter hopes that people with aspirations from various charitable organizations, churches, and schools will voluntarily step forward and participate in the service.</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Industry Decides to Supply Coal and Allocate Electricity to Shanghai Factories: Shipping Coal in Large Quantities to Shanghai to Increase Electricity Generation</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 3rd - Central News Agency Report: The Ministry of Industry, in view of the fact that most factories in Shanghai serving general public needs have been forced to halt operations due to insufficient electricity, has decided to transport large quantities of coal to Shanghai each month through the Coal Production Supervision Committee to supply the Central China Water and Electricity Company. This is intended to increase electricity generation and allocate it in a unified manner to important factories in Shanghai, in an attempt to save the industries from collapse. The Ministry has already consulted with all relevant parties regarding this plan for coal supply and electricity allocation, and it is expected to be implemented soon. The details of the plan are as follows: The Coal Production Supervision Committee of the Ministry of Industry (hereinafter referred to as "the Committee") will transport coal to the Central China Water and Electricity Company (hereinafter referred to as "the Company") as much as possible. Upon receiving the above-mentioned coal supply, the Company shall calculate the possible amount of electricity that can be allocated before the 25th of each month and notify the Ministry of Industry. The Ministry of Industry will then allocate the electricity in a unified manner, create a list, and notify the Company. The Company shall generate electricity promptly according to the notification. The amount of electricity allocated to the Company will be determined at any time based on the analysis results and coal quality analysis. The Committee and the Company will jointly designate relevant personnel to handle this. The Company shall pay the Committee for the coal at the allocated price. If this is insufficient to cover costs, the Committee shall directly order the electricity-receiving factories to compensate for the difference. The Company will continue to collect electricity fees from the electricity-receiving factories according to regulations.</p>

<h3>Commander Chen of the Military Police Inspects Wuxi</h3>

<h3>The Propaganda Department Changes Office Hours</h3>

<h3>Subtle US-Chongqing Relations</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report: According to sources in Shanghai, US Ambassador to Chongqing, Hurley, and the US Commander in Chongqing, Wedemeyer, suddenly issued a joint statement on the 20th of last month. The issuance of this statement contains complex and intertwined reasons. Ambassador Hurley is a supporter of the Chongqing regime. When he returned to the country to report on his duties, he made speeches supporting Chongqing, advocating that US military aid to Chongqing should not be supplied to Yan'an. However, Wedemeyer sympathizes with Yan'an. Not only does he advocate recognizing the areas occupied by the Communist Party, but he also advocates recognizing the border region government, hoping to reconcile the military forces of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. As for US military aid to Chongqing, he stated that it should not be used for civil war. Therefore, the two men have conflicting opinions, and there have been some frictions. Ambassador Hurley, in view of this, sought to adjust the uncoordinated diplomatic situation of the US in Chongqing, and had no choice but to issue the aforementioned joint statement with Wedemeyer. However, this has aroused criticism from the Chinese Communist Party. According to the Xinhua News Agency in Yan'an, Hurley is an imperialist and Chongqing is a dictatorial government. They also pointed out that Hurley does not understand the true meaning of democracy and will inevitably interfere in China's internal affairs in the future. Therefore, recent criticisms from the Chinese Communist Party against Chongqing and the US have become commonplace. Looking back on the past US aid to the Chinese Communist Party, its purpose was to restrain Chongqing. Later, when the Chongqing regime accepted aid from the US, the US abandoned its aid to the Chinese Communist Party and jointly supported Chongqing. It can be seen that the relationship is quite subtle, and the relationship between Chongqing and the US can be seen from this.</p>
<h3>The Three-Headed Conference is Near: The Venue is Being Arranged, "Midsummer Palace" Has Been Renovated</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 3rd - Central News Agency Report: According to a Reuters diplomatic correspondent, none of the three countries (Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union) are confirmed to be the host of the upcoming Three-Headed Conference. However, various circles in London deeply believe that the location of the conference will definitely become an area strictly guarded by the military police of the three countries, and each country will implement self-defense during the conference. It is also reported that all the arrangements required for the conference are currently in progress. "Midsummer Palace" in Potsdam has also been renovated.

<h3>Regulations on the Payment Methods for Central Reserve Special Promissory Notes: Can Be Transferred and Exchanged Like Other Negotiable Instruments</h3>
<p>In order to stabilize the entire financial situation in Shanghai, eliminate the bad practice of discounting, and prevent financial institutions from issuing cash transfer requests, the financial authorities, through discussions between the Central Reserve Bank and the responsible parties of the banking and money shop guilds, decided that from yesterday (the 3rd), the 64 designated exchange banks of the Central Reserve Bank and the member banks and money shops of the Banking and Money Shop Reserve Treasury will cease issuing cash transfer requests from the Central Reserve Bank and the Banking Union and Money Shop Reserve Treasury, and instead use payment from customer deposits, paying cash within possible limits, and absolutely prohibiting banks and money shops from discounting. It is reported that the payment methods for the Central Reserve Bank's special promissory notes are as follows: Central Reserve Bank special promissory notes can be endorsed for transfer and exchanged like other negotiable instruments. Central Reserve Bank special promissory notes can supplement the exchange position of the day. When financial institutions hold Central Reserve Bank special promissory notes to collect from the Central Reserve Bank, they can state their reasons and receive cash.</p>
<p>Banks and Money Shops Issue Promissory Notes Cautiously</p>
<p>The semi-annual settlement holiday for the banking and money shop industries in this city has ended, and normal business operations resumed yesterday (the 3rd). The banking and money shop industries have complied with the Central Reserve Bank authorities' order and stopped using cash transfer requests from yesterday. The cash transfer requests for banks and money shops can only be received and not issued. When depositors withdraw large amounts of cash from banks and money shops, promissory notes can only be issued under absolutely cautious circumstances. Customers holding promissory notes must comply with the deadline of presenting them within ten days. It is understood that the promissory notes of banks and money shops are exclusively for customers. Transactions between banks and money shops and the Banking Union and Money Shop Reserve Treasury can use transfer application forms. Banks and money shops can only do so if they have deposits with the treasury. This measure is significant in preventing the issuance of bad promissory notes.</p>
<p>Cash Payments Become Slightly Easier</p>
<p>Since the cash transfer requests were discontinued on the 3rd of this month, the Central Reserve Bank authorities realized that the need for cash would become urgent, so they specially supplied cash positions to the banking and money shop industries. Since the 29th of last month, the banking industry has withdrawn approximately 300,000,000,000 yuan in cash, and the money shop industry has withdrawn more than 100,000,000,000 yuan in cash. Therefore, the amount of cash paid to customers by banks and money shops yesterday when they withdrew deposits was slightly easier than before. If the banks and money shops fully cooperate with wartime financial enthusiasm and no longer seek illegal profits from discounting the cash they have received, then the cash panic can be gradually resolved.</p>
<h3>Gold Securities Market Holds Opening Ceremony Yesterday: 495 Taels Traded Throughout the Day</h3>

Then, the vice president of the Central Reserve Bank gave a speech, explaining the significance of the gold securities market and hoping that brokers would not engage in speculation while buying and selling gold securities on behalf of their clients for investment purposes, and that they would cooperate with the authorities in stabilizing financial policy.

The detailed measures are still being coordinated by the municipal government authorities. Regarding the rumor that the free rice distribution to Chinese police officers will be discontinued, the reporter also inquired about it. The response was that it was completely groundless and that the distribution would continue. In short, the authorities are committed to stabilizing the lives of police officers, so the subordinate officers can rest assured and serve with peace of mind.</p>
<p>Criminal Defendants Granted Bail</p>
<p>Li Shiyu, the director of the Third Division of the Municipal Police Bureau, strives to promote police judicial affairs and eradicate the remnants of the former concession police departments. The investigation of criminal suspects must never involve torture to extract confessions, and bail is granted to suspects of minor crimes, without unreasonable detention. Since the Ministry of Judicial Administration promulgated the bail measures for criminal defendants, it has also ordered its subordinates and the judicial police officers of the third section of each branch bureau to strictly comply with the regulations, focusing on implementing bail procedures for criminal suspects. Except for criminals involved in major crimes that require strict investigation, there must be no intentional obstruction, illegal detention, or extortion or revenge for personal vendettas. If such situations are discovered, they will be punished as dereliction of duty and dealt with severely according to the law.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Regulates County and District Baojia Fees</h3>

<h3>New City Police Branch Bureau Seizes Forged Cash Transfer Requests: Criminal Shao Lizhang Will Be Severely Dealt With</h3>
<p>On June 26th, the Fourth Section of the New City Branch Bureau received a tip-off that a criminal named Shao Lizhang was altering residence permits and forging cash transfer requests for use, posing a clear threat to financial security. The section chief Zheng Zhong reported this to Branch Chief Li, who led seven plainclothes police officers to investigate No. 5, Lane 471, Xinzha Road, at around 1:00 AM that day. Shao was arrested on the spot, along with a forged cash transfer request seized at the scene, and taken back to the bureau for interrogation. It was found that Shao Lizhang was a printing and platemaking worker. On June 21st, while playing at the Wenhua Art Printing Company at No. 1020, Baoding Road, he stole six blank cash transfer requests, filled in the amounts, and used them outside one after another. Suspecting that he intended to destroy the forged cash transfer requests, he privately altered his residence permit, changing the number 99812 to 899442, the name Shao Lizhang to Shao Enzhang, the age 31 to 39, and the address No. 5, Lane 471, Xinzha Road to No. 3, Lane 571, Xinzha Road, and the Baojia district to 5th Joint, 11th Bao, 11th Jia, 3rd Household from 3rd Joint, 11th Bao, 10th Jia, 2nd Household. His actions were extremely cunning. He forged a total of six cash transfer requests, five of which had been used outside, and the remaining one was seized at his home. It was further discovered that he exchanged two of them, totaling 260,000 yuan, for cash at a discounted rate with Shen Daren, and the matter was discovered. Witnesses are now present, and the case has been transferred to the Third Section for handling through judicial procedures.</p>

<h3>Economic Bureau Revises Rules for Handling Overdue Returns and Incorrectly Received Material Allocation Certificates</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Economic Bureau, regarding the "Rules for Handling Overdue Returns and Incorrectly Received Material Allocation Certificates by Public Sales Outlets, Retail Outlets, and Bread Manufacturers" previously established by the Material Allocation Office, has found that some aspects are not fully applicable and should be supplemented. The bureau has made appropriate revisions, which have been submitted to the municipal government for approval and promulgation. It is reported that the bureau has also compiled the revised rules and instructed all affiliated public sales outlets, retail outlets, bread factories, etc., to comply with them. The rules are excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>Article 1: These rules are established by the Shanghai Special Municipality Economic Bureau for handling overdue returns and incorrectly received material allocation certificates by public sales outlets, retail outlets, and bread manufacturers.</p>
<p>Article 2: All public sales outlets, retail outlets, and bread manufacturers approved by the bureau shall return the used material allocation certificates by the date specified by the bureau for verification and cancellation. Failure to return the used material allocation certificates by the specified date will result in a fine of 100 national currency per registration number per day overdue.</p>
<p>Article 3: Public sales outlets, retail outlets, and bread manufacturers that return used material allocation certificates more than one week overdue will be fined as stipulated in the previous article and will also receive a written warning. If they do not reform after three warnings, their qualifications as public sales outlets, retail outlets, or bread manufacturers may be revoked.</p>
<p>Article 4: Public sales outlets, retail outlets, and bread manufacturers that return used material allocation certificates overdue due to unavoidable reasons shall submit a written explanation to the bureau. If the reasons are verified by the bureau, the fine may be reduced or waived.</p>
<p>Article 5: Public sales outlets, retail outlets, and bread manufacturers that sell allocated goods shall only accept allocation certificates with the same registration number and within the validity period. If they incorrectly receive allocation certificates with other registration numbers or that are overdue or not yet due, they will be subject to the following penalties:</p>
<p>For the first-time incorrect receipt of a material allocation certificate with another registration number, a warning will be issued, but the incorrectly received portion will be invalidated and not allowed to be compensated.</p>
<p>For the second-time incorrect receipt of a material allocation certificate with another registration number, in addition to the incorrectly received portion not being allowed to be used, a fine of 50 national currency per certificate will be imposed.</p>
<p>For the third or more incorrect receipt of a material allocation certificate with another registration number, in addition to the incorrectly received portion not being allowed to be used, a fine of 100 national currency per certificate will be imposed.</p>
<p>For the incorrect receipt of overdue or not yet due material allocation certificates, regardless of the circumstances, in addition to all incorrectly received portions not being allowed to be used, a fine of 50 national currency per certificate will be imposed for the first time, 100 national currency per certificate for the second time, and 200 national currency per certificate for the third or more times.</p>
<p>Article 6: All material allocation certificates that are not allowed to be used will be listed by the bureau's Seventh Section and sent to the Eighth Section for verification each period. The loss of goods due to incorrect receipt will still be the responsibility of the person who incorrectly received them.</p>
<p>Article 7: For violations of the provisions of Article 5 of these rules, the bureau will first separately store the material allocation certificates found to have been incorrectly received, and then notify the responsible person of the incorrect receipt for verification and then impose the penalty.</p>
<p>Article 8: All fines imposed for violations of these rules shall be paid directly to the bureau's Ninth Section with the bureau's departure notice to verify the collection of the certificates.</p>
<p>Article 9: Thirty percent of the fines imposed for violations of Article 2 and the various clauses of Article 5 of these rules may be extracted as bonuses for the staff members of the bureau's responsible department.</p>
