<h3>國軍前鋒越過連山　向葫蘆島錦州疾進　平綏路共軍竄犯大同</h3>
<p>〔合衆社重慶子三日電〕據合衆社記者自軍界獲得消息，國軍第十三車，正以坦克軍。重砲及裝甲軍，向錦州推進。國軍前鋒業已越過運山，其中一部向南直趨葫蘆島，一部則正向東北方錦州推進。國軍預料。共軍將在錦州頑強抵抗。共軍裝甲師團主力，現正集中瀋陽一帶，準備全力阻止國軍攻勢。</p>
<p>〔聨合社天津廿二日是電〕國軍進入東九省境，至今晚已達一百八十華里，進逼北寗鐵路中心點錦州，共地駐有共軍約一萬人至二萬人，預料將在該處首次抵抗國軍。迄今國軍所遇共軍，裝備訓練均劣。國軍主力沿鐵路線前進甚速，共軍炸毀路軌橋樑，即由國軍修路隊隨時修復。錦州大戰當於下星期末展開，國軍若能將其個別領，實力不致大損，則通至六百餘里外之瀋陽，當屬輕而易舉。</p>
<p>〔合衆社重慶廿三日電〕據可靠方而吿記者稱；馬占山將軍，現正率部抵達東九省境內。又稱另一東北游擊領袖王德林將軍，亦已動員其舊部，協助國軍接收東北。衆信馬占山將軍在東北，尤其在黑龍江方面，現仍有極大潛勢力。</p>
<p>〔又電〕頃由秦皇島歸抵此間之某高級軍實告記者稱：共軍兵力在東北境內，現有配備齊全之兩師團，在華北則有若干武裝配備之旅團，均屬八路軍之最精銳者。渠又稱：師團中所有裝甲車。坦克及砲軍，均係蘇重自日方接收下來之戰具。朱德現正在瀋陽地區，忙於佈置錦州附近之第一道防線。共軍有企圖在國軍進抵體路線時，一舉攻陷國軍之勢，但無論如何，國軍方面現正佈置三尖頭鉗形運動，以擊破其謀略。</p>
<p>〔合衆社重慶三日電〕據第十二戰區司令部發言人稱平綏路共軍主力，正向大同推進。共軍在大同一帶，曾出動坦克五輛，由「國籍不明之外人」爲其駕駛。另有共軍四萬人，經固安開赴唐山。唐山開平附近，已早右共軍一萬人從事破壞　路，山海關一帶軍，約為四萬，共軍强徵天津至秦皇島間鐵路綫附近農民，迫使破壞路軌，開往熱河之共軍，傳曾沿途搶刦糧食。國軍花北平以北九十里之密雲縣，與共軍雖有衝突，但不激烈。</p>
<h3>中蘇談判　傳將發表公報</h3>
<p>〔路透社重慶二十三日電〕據此間某報載稱：中蘇兩國不日將發表關於東北地位，與管制共同公報，中蘇當局現仍在融洽談判中，蘇聯當局準備履行其條約義務，柬北前途之吉兇，悉繫於政治談判，如能順利進行，　吿成功，則不出一個半月，東北全部各大城鎭，悉可由國軍塡防云。</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶二十三電〕此問接可靠消息稱：外貝加爾區蘇軍司令馬林諾斯基，電請中央接收東北官員復回長春，與之繼續談判。據中國報紙載稱：東北行營主任熊式輝未離長春時，馬林諾斯基曾提出中蘇合辦東九省各種礦產之要求云。某報載稱：前由重慶赴長春接收之中央官員，所受待遇甚爲不良，蘇方安置於前日本煤業公所，實際上遭受監視。全體人員三百餘名，祇供給汽車一輛，卡車二國，及馬車數輛，共軍於十一月十六六包圍飛機塲，此項接收官員由蘇方保護，始能分乘飛機十架回來。</p>
<h3>共軍宣稱佔領鹽城　國軍解除包頭危勢</h3>
<p>寗夏河南新加坡等地電請速制裁</p>
<p>〔合衆社重慶廿三日電〕共　今宣布：新四軍已佔領顯城。</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿三日電〕安徽泗州·旴貽·靈璧·五河·天長·定遠·嘉山等縣城中，因遭受共軍慘殺，相率逃亡至津浦綫者，不下數十萬人。</p>
<p>〔中央社漯河廿三日電〕共軍現增集於棗陽及其外園之七房崗，湘陽鎭，黑龍廟一帶，已達二萬餘人，附有戰軍機槍千餘挺，企圖固守其竊踞之大洪桐柏兩山。又共軍李先部第五師警衛團及基幹軍千餘，近擴大組織爲第三十三，第三十四，第三十五三個團，聲言將建立大洪桐柏兩山根據地，並破壞交通，打擊國軍，以作共產黨與政府談判之後盾。確山共黨區長龔雲儉，鹿琿長，袁新仁，十日同確山縣府投誠。</p>
<p>〔合衆社重慶廿三日電〕國軍在包頭採取擊破鐵圈戰術後，包頭危勢業經解除。共軍乃轉取側面作戰，並已抵達包頭迤西三十英里處，圖向自由中國綏西一帶深入。</p>
<p>〔中央社天津廿三日電〕北寗路售客票至唐山，共產軍仍不時滋擾，二十一日晚有一小股竄至茶淀蘆台問，企岡破壞十八與十九兩號鐵橋，幸經　路隊發覺，予以驅逐，故日來津唐間通車無阻，平津間客車則因共產軍不時出沒沿綫潛伏，致兩日來車行時間，不能準確。</p>

<h3>周恩來候機飛延安　同行十九人葉劍英可來渝</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶二十三日電〕周恩來近日仍待機飛延。因周係乘美P47式機，該機乃由滬飛渝者，日前寒流侵襲川鄂間高地，曾試飛三次，均因機　結厚冰而折回上海。隨周氏同行者有隨員十五人，美聯社，合衆社，太陽報，紐約時報記者各一人，共二十人。聞葉劍英可偕周來渝，作爲政治協商會議代表，並參加三人小組軍事會議。如周氏在延安能縮短時間，如共產黨能接受中央意旨，政治會議可能下月一日召開。</p>
<h3>經財兩部考慮中　僞幣資金折合問題　各業工商領袖發表意見提供參考</h3>
<p>〔本報特訊〕自僞幣明令二百作一之後，本市工商各界賬面金額，大都已自九月或十月份起，加以調整。間有少數商家，則須俟年度開始，再行聲理。最困難整理者，爲資本折合問題，本報經濟記者在官廳方面探悉，本市各業公會整理委員經派定者，已近二百業，但各公會會員登記，據聞並不甚踴躍。即社會局將舉辦之工商業登記，以及直接稅局營業說申報等，亦多因資本折合問題，未能決定，頗難塡報。記者因此問題，曾遍訪各有關方面探訪意見，彙誌如左：</p>
<p>具體辦法迄未決定</p>
<p>據會計師整理會負責人談，本會對於資本額之整理，曾組織小組會議，討論多次，各會計師所提方案，亦何止數十起，但求其完全合乎法理而簡單易行者，迄尙未有具體辦法。惟經綜合各會計師方案，假定爲（甲）資金完全法幣，由僞令强迫以二折一折成僞幣者，仍回復法幣原額。（乙）資本原爲法幣，僞幣流通後曾經增加資本，換言之，除法幣之資本額照僞幣二作一後，再收偽幣作爲增加資本者，其原資仍回復法幣金額，再將資產加以約略估計。如情形尙佳，則所收偽幣資本增加額，以一對一換算爲法幣。（丙）其資金完全在僞幣流通後收集者，則將資產大的估計，如情形尙佳，即將一對一換算。上擬假定辦法，如現有純資產過高或過低時，則再照增資減資手續辦理。總之一切均力求折合程序簡單化，以免多所紛更。至納稅問題，除純資產過高，應照升股分紅辦法辦理外，政府對於資木換算所得之差益，宜免課所得稅及利得稅。</p>
<p>會計專家發表意見</p>
<p>記者並以此事訪問會計專家多人，據云，此法如在會計學理上研究，當然還有許多問題，尙待討論。但爲整理工商業資本金額之簡便起見，尙不失爲一可以通行之原則，在實行時如果另有例外問題發現，則可分別處理云。於此可見資本額折合問題之困難，於工商業之復興，亦不無因之阻碍。市商會對此問題，亦已電請經濟財政兩部，明示辦法，迄未答復，則又可見政府對此亦正需愼重考慮。市商會對此不易解決，而又必須即速解決之資本額折合問題，在該會組織之工商法規研究委負會中，曾專案提出討論，並邀本市有名會計法學專家，及工商領袖，共同研討，對此資本金額折合問題，不久或有較安善辦法議定。</p>
<p>一時波動即可解決</p>
<p>記者並據商會常務理事談，僞幣自明定折算率後，本市商界已一度波動，但此僅指在市面上流通僞幣而言，現在已經實行收回，早晚即可吿一結束。至於賬據上一般財產金額之折合，原不必統照此比例折算，且如銀行及信托事業，在僞組織强迫增資時，所收之僞幣資本，應如何以合法手續整理折算，尤費周章。本人甚盼各工商業界如有具體辦法，希望儘量提供，以便集思廣益，自政府建議。因收復區之種種困難情形，尤其是幣値時常變動所受痛苦最甚，但亦惟吾商人知之最詳。現在會方已呈請經濟財政兩部指示，如果等到政府聯法規定以後，再來批評，實爲不智。</p>
<p>中央關切本市工商</p>
<p>又據商會工商法規研究委員會主任委員談市工商業至爲關切，亟盼於可能範圍內減少波動，俾復典工作得以順利進行。本人極希此資本折合問題，及早得有解決辦法。近來各方面來會訪問採詢，大半集中於此一問題，但欲求合情合法之盡善辦法，則誠如會計師公會代表所稱，尙無具體辦法，須重加研討云。</p>
<p>整理資金値得考慮</p>
<p>本市機器染織業公會負責人潘氏對此間題稱，企業賬面資本金額之整理，確爲値得焦慮之問題，本會屢經討論，亦無妥善辦法。惟一部份以可照二百作一之比例折算者，實欠考慮。因此二百作一之比率，係中央體恤收復區流通僞幣之受累，所定之收兌辦法，至於資本在會計學上係資產減負債之餘，並非資本主現存之流通券，資本幾經運用，形體早已變化，純資產値亦因而須重新整理，何得以整理流通券之法，來整理資本金額。本公會對此問題正在邀集同業，詳細商討中云。</p>
<h3>會計師公會　決定處理辦法</h3>
<p>上海市會計師公會整理委員會，已決定並通過，企業僞幣資本改爲法幣之處理辦法，對目前企業資本額之決定，祇有根據其現存財產之凈値，確實佔計其法幣之價値，以爲其法幣資本之基礎。擬訂之辦法爲（一）資本原爲法幣，其後改成僞幣，但並未增減資本者，應將其資本恢復爲法幣原額。（二）資本原爲法幣，其後改成僞幣，且經增加僞幣責本者，應根據其現有財產，以法幣估計其凈値。此項凈値如足値賬面偽幣資本原額者，得照僞幣原額改爲法幣。如不足額，應由出資人，補繳法幣足額或減少其資本額。（三）資本自始即爲僞幣者，應照前列第二項規定辦理。企業資本之處理調整，依法應由公司或企業之執行業務人，召集股東或出資人會議，將處理資本辦法提交通過，然後執行，庶可免除糾紛。將來俟幣制穩定，稅制修正後，再行正確佔計財產凈値，調整資本賞額，以期達到會計正確之目的，實爲吾會計師同業唯一之願望。</p>

<h3>社論　原子能的管制</h3>
<p>我國外交部長近以中國政府對於管制原子能之見解，照會美國務卿貝爾納斯，聲明兩點：（一）中國政府希望建設中之原子能管理委員會立即成立，以保證此種能力轉移破壞目標，而用於和平及人道目的；（二）中國政府充分承認澈底保護文明，勿受科學知識摧毀，惟一方法乃爲放棄戰爭。此則唯有羣固並擴大聯合國機構權力，始能達到。這一照會，重申了我國對於處理國際問題的基本原則：這就是爲維護國際正義，人類文明，我們主張原子能的利用，應從其破壞目標轉移到爲人類謀福利的目標；戰爭應該被放乘，聯合國的被構權力應予鞏問及擴大。國民政府對於處理國際問題，始終無自私的動機，却站在維護國際正義及人類文明的立塲上。這不但爲全國人民所擁護，並且還受到其它一般國家的熱　支持的。</p>
<p>我們曾習聞其它國家的對外政策：例如美國的門羅主義及門戶開放，英國的抑制均衡等等。如果有人問我們的對外政策是什麼，我們可以說是在維護國際正義，人類文明。在從前，我們可以說沒有什麼對外政策。處於次殖民地的情况，在國際政治上我們處處皆居於被動的地位，我們只能在消極方面有所作爲，未能在積極方面提供我們的意見。如今局勢一變，這幾年來我國在國際政治上的活動漸漸地凝成了我國的對外政策，這是件極可喜的事。</p>
<p>在鈎心鬥角的國際政治上，不免形成許多暗礁，其實多山於覇道思想在作祟。我們主張維護正義，這問不一完是空谷足音，却表達出了許多弱小民族的意願。維護正義及謀人類福利原是崇商的道德　　，　我們的對外政策却就在維特這些道德似値。這一政策的凝成，賞由於我國立國的三民主義之中正和平。中是不偏不袒，正是主張正義，和是和諧，平是平衡。從中正和平的出發點，我們主張國際上應有協調，對於這些基本的道德價値應該予以維護。然而這一政策的凝成也是經渦慘痛的經騐的。過去因爲國際正義不申而有「九一八」之變；因爲國際正義不張，於是招致國外的侵略。所以我們之有這個政策的凝成，是百年恥辱，八年抗戰，流了無量數的血的結果。這代表我們民族的理想，同時，也可以說代表了人類的希望。</p>
<p>在關於原子能的管制上，特別應從國際正義及爲人類謀福利的立塲着眼，自廣島及長畸上空投下了兩個原子彈以後以改變了人類整個的前途。原子能的利用，可能使人類得到無窮的幸福，也可能使整個人類歸於毀滅。試想一想，一個原子彈幾乎將整個廣島毀滅了，死傷了三十餘萬人；則整個國家，整個世界，可爲數量很小的原子彈所毀滅。人類因原子能的使用而進入一個新時代。這個時代在人類的歷史上將爲劃期的，如果原子能用在爲人類謀福利上，則後世之人視我們今日的人類，眞彷彿有如現代的人類看石器時代的人類一樣了。</p>
<p>因爲原子能的破壞性很大，如果作爲一種武器將是未來戰爭中的一種決定因素。誰能製造多量的原子彈誰便能控制未來的戰爭。故各國對於原子能的管制，看法未必盡同。利用原十能製造原子彈的成功，雖在美國，却曾得到國際的合作。英國供給了人才，加拿大供給了人才及必要的物資，美國也供給了人才及物資；此外還有意大利科學家，逃亡在外的德國猶太籍科學家，丹麥的科學家。特別因爲原子彈製造的成功在美國，故美國彷彿視爲一個上帝松它的法寳。它得到這個法寳是由於神的托付，來利用它維持世界和平的。蘇聯未曾參加這個國際合作，故它要求公開。在公開與秘密這一點上，其實是無可爭論的。沒有一種科學發明能够保持長時期的秘密；問題是如何能轉移它使用的目標，從它的毀減性的性能移轉到爲人類謀和平，爲人類謀福利。在這一點上，我政府對於管制原十能所抱的見解，實是値得我們稱讚的。</p>
<p>但問題的要點還是在人類因有原子能利用的成功，應該革面洗心，重新有一個人生觀，重新有一個國家觀。因爲原子能的毀滅性大，人類生活應該澈底改革，力求和諧。軸心國家思以霸術統制世界的失敗，應該促醒其它思以霸道統制世界的國家，不再犯同樣的錯誤。原子彈利用的成功更應該促醒他們的企圖之無用：然而在今却還或有思以雷術統制世界的國家。原子彈改變了世界，原子彈更應改變人心。我們尤其感覺到憤恨與遺憾的，就是在這樣一個原子時代，我們全國應該如何一致協力於建國的艱巨工作，迎頭趕上去。我們原是工業落後的國家，人家已經到利用原子能了，而我們還滯留在手工業的狀態下。如今八年抗戰旣經勝利結束，正當努力復員向建國之途邁進的時候，而乃有別懷野心之徒，破壞交通，稱兵作亂。人民已經望治喁喁，那能再經兵火。原子彈對于他們應該有一種覺醒！</p>
<p>人類能否放棄戰爭，這不是我們所要解答的問題。在國際方面，如欲防制戰爭惟有加强國際機構的權力。因爲原子能的使用，更應將聯合國的機構權力加强及鞏固起來。這是最有效的國際管制原子能的方法。在我國政府表明對於管制原子能的見解上，這又是値得稱道的一點。渦去國際聯盟的無能，防制不了世界第二次大戰的發生。如今因有原子能的使用，我們不能再蹈過去的覆轍。必使聯合國的機構加强鞏同起來，然後人類才能免於自相殘殺，步入一個新的時代；人類才能因原子能利用的成功而得到福利。</p>

<h3>英下院開會辯論　華府原子彈宣言　阿特里籲請各國予以響應</h3>
<p>〔中央社記者任坽遜廿二日倫敦電〕英首相阿特崖廿二日午於下院籌論時，報吿赴美經過，　請一切國家對渠與美總統杜魯門及加總理金氏於華盛頓所共同發表關於原子能之聲明中所標揭之各項原則，矛以普遍之　應。英首相致詞時，下院議席滿座，渠吿到會人士稱，英美加三國於華府會談期中所商談者，非特關於原子能之未來政策，且爲肅淸世界戰爭之更大問題。自　特里視之，原子彈已使一般人士體認如欲保持文明，即絕不容世界大戰之重演，「各國如不秉持善意，決心勿使戰爭威脅作爲政策之工具，國際方而對於原子彈及其他毀滅性武器，即不能加以有效之控制。」據首相稱，華盛頓會議之舉行，係由渠建議者。</p>
<p>艾登發言針對蘇聯</p>
<p>繼由前外相艾登發言，建議廢東聯合國憲章所規定之否決權，俾適應原子能發現後之情勢，並喚起各國坦白陳述其對於統治權之現行意見。艾登復論及對蘇聯關係稱：蘇聯與共同取得勝利之兩大友邦即英美兩國，猜忌與不信任之熊度日益加深，此爲無可否認之事，殊堪這　。深信來日之和平，實繫於英美蘇三國之諒解。吾人知蘇聯之準備，並非爲對付吾人，自亦切望其深化吾人之準備，亦非爲對付蘇聯。</p>

<p>〔路透社倫敦二十三日電〕英自相阿特里昨夜在下院宣言曰，全面戰爭之各項武器，皆為足以整個破壞者。吾人如欲文明　續存在，則必須排除全面戰爭，使不再見於世界面後可。凡適用於　個破壞之武器，無一得在供平常維持內部安全與保護政府制非法行動用之必要武器中佔任何合法地位。次述渠在結府會商原子能之祥情曰，余意今欲將原炸彈事，成一單純問題，而不與供破壞用之其他武器相提並論，實不可能。曩者曾有一時作戰所用之武器，在吾人今日觀之，側屬非常幼稚，戰爭所釀之損失與破壞。輒能於數年之中修治平復，其痛苦雖大，然尙有限度，有時甚至損失輕微。彼握權者計算戰爭之費用與所得之利益相較，尙為値得用之，其實所謂利益，在今日輒不値一顧者也。此種對於戰爭之態度，在吾人之一代中，已不能再具之矣。</p>
<h3>保持文明不墮　不容戰爭重演</h3>
<p>原子炸彈現爲最新破壞性之名詞，但此或非爲最後者，而就今日觀之，已無以對付。故如期文明繼續存在，則必須使第一次與第二次世界大戰不再見之。故余向美總統致詞時，與在市府演說時，以及在各次討論中，輒以在科學已將此種慘烈武器置於人手之新時代中，不特須將原子炸彈擯諸各國武庫之外，且須計及何種世界秩序乃屬必要爲懷。余强調此言，蓋以往時亦嘗數作企圖，排除或種武器與或種作戰行爲而稍獲成功也。往時有數次戰爭，雙方頗能忠實遵守日內瓦公約，第排除或種武器之企圖，則直可謂歸於失敗焉。當夫一九一四至一九一八年戰爭發生以前，曾禁用瓦斯作戰，其後仍不免用之。余敢謂此次戰爭中，納粹如以爲殊値得用及瓦斯，則必已再用之矣。今者一次轟炸城市之威力，已足使世界充滿恐怖，而在此次戰爭中，倫敦市民固已每日嘗到此味矣。余不信在戰爭的世界中，除甚有限之範圍外，能施「昆斯白里規則」（此規則原供角賽拳擊時用者）。</p>
<h3>如不秉持善意　管制決難收效</h3>
<p>吾人今當注意在規模可與此次大戰相比較之戰爭中，必將需用各種武器，則大量用及原子炸彈，必不能免其結果將使大城全成灰燼，死者以千萬計，且將使文明後退至不可想像之年代。今雖殫精竭慮，終不能籌得一安全方法，而足爲有效保障以制止蓄志侵略之國家製造原子武器。各國旣面臨破壞性的科學之慘烈現實，自將迫切覺悟設法使戰爭毒害脫離世界，實爲急不容緩之舉。</p>
<p>聯合國機構之會議，今已在消弭戰爭無疑。余之用「堅主用此」言，因在余意中，此實爲問題之中心，正如武器之稽查或管制制度，若無誠意，決難行之有效。然一切國際機構縱審愼組成，苟非各國堅決不以戰爭或戰爭成脅爲政策之一種工具，苟非各國決計以互相信任自處，而使戰爭無從發生，則決無任何效益也。此固爲唯一眞正解決之道，而凡含有任何成功機會之保衛方法，皆不可忽略或漢視之，第互相信任終屬必要。</p>
<h3>英美加三國間　互惠交換知識</h3>
<p>吾人當憶今日地面已有廣大區域，此種信任早已存在矣，即吾人與任何自治領間決無發生戰爭之日，英國或加拿大或任何其他自洽領與美國間，決無發生戰爭之日是也。（衆歡呼）廣播此種信任於全世界，似爲任何政治家應爲之工作，華盛頓宣言之作，即求增進信任，俾吾人可以加力進行，使戰爭恐慌遠離世界之偉大工作。美國加拿大英國在此宣言中，共同聲明願意交換基本的科學智識，並與願意互惠之任何國協商彼此遣派科學家藉以交換智識。首相繼謂，原子能供和平用途之發展，非經過多年之研究，似不致實現，或在數年中實現亦未可知。今在發展中之手續與方法　當能導成　一用途。數方面人土曾建議此種方法之智識，應如基本的科學消息，使衆周知。然以無綫電廣播吿知全世界，余意此非智者之所爲。第一，此種智識不能以方式或手册或藍本使人明白，僅能引導科學家興技術家至一製造廠所向之詳釋一切，始可了解，而有此專家智識者爲數有限，非經彼等親臨不能爲之，且須經過長久之時間，若向各國如此，顯然爲至難之事，余並以爲不應僅對特殊數國爲之。第二，此種發明旣可用於和平，亦可用於戰爭。</p>
<h3>公開武器秘密　目前顯非適宜</h3>
<p>聯合國機構頃始產生，而尙未離其搖籃，遽將此種製造破壞性的武器之手續廣吿世界，豈智者之爲乎？吾人之意，此必待諸各國間有更大之信任，更大之安全保衛以後。今當問曰，何種保衛可稍有效益乎？諸君而非曾謂今實不能思得一種足爲有效担保之保衛制度乎？余請全院注意共同宣實第三節之言，即可知無相互信任　，無一制度可以收效。　造原子能之方雖頗複雜，血需廣大之機塲，但製成之物其體頗小，　於廣島之炸彈，並不甚重，但控制此種極危險之物質，顯需極度之審愼。惟華盛頓宣言簽字之國家，曾聲明一俟能商妥可以實施有效的保衛，即願依互惠基礎，以此種發明實際用於工業之方法，與各國共享之。吾人爲求達此目的計，曾建議在聯盟國機構中設一委員會。首相於是請全院特別注意委員會之工作，應逐步進行之規定。且復强調說明特殊行動，宜基於信任之需要。首相又請全院注意該委員會不僅將處理原子能事，凡適用於整個破壞之一切武器，皆將涉及之。首相至是又將最先所發之宣言重述一過，並曰，此爲吾人之宣言，余希望全世界響應此項原則，今特於此提出專爲傳播供和平用途並防杜其妄用於戰爭之科學消息之建議，願各國皆予以接受。</p>
<h3>貝文外相　申明英國立塲　各國手中之牌請攤明桌上</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦二十三日電〕英國外相貝文今日在下院中繼續爲期二日之外交辯論，要求任何國家不論大小，凡對英國表示懷疑者，請其明白講出，蓋惟坦白始能克服國與國間之猜疑。「余欲重申前言，即將我等手中之牌攤明桌上。」</p>
<p>茲將其對各國政策，擇要錢次「法國」：吾人希望能與法新政府密切合作。</p>
<p>「義大利」：現被聯軍佔領之義北部諸省，除一小部份外，希望能於數星期內交還美政府。</p>
<p>「希聯」：希望希據政這斯期基諾仍舊繼續當政，挽救政治危局。不贊成在目前情形下，舉行公民投票。</p>
<p>「伊朗」：英政府頃已嚴令軍事當局，切實遵守英蘇伊二國條的。</p>
<h3>美總統明春末　將赴菲一行</h3>
<p>本屆三巨頭會談　希望在華府舉行</p>
<p>〔合衆社廿三日華盛頓電〕消息靈通方面頃稱。杜魯門總統透露渠或將於春末袁初赴菲列賓，宣佈該國之完全獨立。關於原子能問題，杜魯門認爲渠樂於與阿特里及史達林在華府討論，但不希望在倫敦或莫斯科或其他地點舉行會談。</p>

<h3>納粹黨徒陰謀重重　圖炸紐倫堡法院　彼等皆知戰犯生命多難保　炸毀法院使領袖同歸於盡</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦二十三日電〕紐倫堡法院現僱用德國平民多人，其中有一十九齡之女郞名羅美爾者，任圖書室管理員，日者曾告每日郵報駐紐倫堡訪員曰，吾人皆以遇禍爲懼因開巴伐利亞與紐倫堡之納粹，將圖炸毀法院也。余知爾輩英人絕未思及在此如何遭人嫉視，且絕未料及爾輩四周伏有幾多不法之徒。彼等迄今尙無動作，但吾人相信彼等旣見審問戰爭罪犯如何進行時，必將有所舉動。彼等皆知戰爭罪犯多數將不保生命，則炸毀法院面使其往日之領袖同歸於盡，亦無所顧慮。納粹領袖之審判，今日已入第四日，審判長勞倫斯勳爵宣布明日將停止審判一天。美檢察官華理斯繼續陳述納粹陰謀家統制德國之經過。</p>
<h3>韓國領袖金九</h3>
<p>— 吳嘉棠</p>
<p>〔本報專訪〕在滬停留四日之蔣主席專機，昨晨八時在和暖的陽覺之下，飛載韓國臨時政府主席金九及其隨員四人，離滬東飛。金氏離江灣機塲時，表示渠不久有再度來滬可能，惟日期尙難定。今後施政　策，當以親善中韓邦交爲最大目標；同時對滬上各軍政長官之殷勤招待，表示深切感謝。</p>
<p>虹口公園中驚人的一幕</p>
<p>金九—胡鮮的革命領袖—　國臨時政府主席，在一片歡欣的勝利聲中，首先爲祖國取得自由獨立的旗幟，於昨日歸漢城去了。</p>
<p>雖然已屆七旬的高齡，他面上却仍顯露着罕見的成容，充分地表示出超人的毅力。使人立刻回憶到十三年前，轟動舉世的上海虹口公園大炸案的一幕。民二十一年四月二十九日，量也就是金九的「屠倭」政策得到了最偉大的成功。</p>
<p>誰也忘不了這一次　人的傑作。爆炸下的傷亡者，白川臥棺回國，重光總領事失掉一只脚，海軍上將野村成了獨眼。</p>
<p>蔣主席乃是偉大的領袖</p>
<p>在朝鮮革命史上，上海占有重要的地位。韓國最初第一個的臨時政府，最初是在上海組織的。其他的地下抗日工作，也在上海首先策動。在過去，我國政府及國民黨，予朝鮮革命志士以不斷的扶助，所以金氏對記者很忠誠的說：「蔣主席是偉大的領袖，也是韓國的良友！」</p>
<p>金氏此次回國，面對着許多困難問題。朝鮮今日雖然被解放了，但仍在蘇美軍事佔領之下，因爲雙方不能互讓，伏下了正面衝突的危機。金氏對記者說：「我們此次回國，是承美軍當局的邀請，以個人的資絡，去謀取韓國的統一。</p>
<p>靠自己力量謀獨立自由</p>
<p>第三十八度緯綫，今日成爲韓國南北的分水界；南韓在美軍占領下包括慶上南北，全羅南北，忠淸南北，及江原等省。這是韓國的農產區械，人口的二千餘萬，占全韓人口三分之二。北韓是工業區，目下在蘇軍統治之下。有最大的水力發電廠，化工廠，紡織廠，肥田粉廠，飛機製造廠，軍工廠，及錦磺等。農工旣劃成兩個互不通問的軍政區域，南韓的農民就感覺到工業品的恐慌，而北韓的工人，則極度的缺乏糧食及其他農產品，</p>
<p>金氏很明瞭這類問題的複雜，非短時期內所能解決。他說：「我們希望在聯合國的機構中，能產生一個妥善的辦法，使韓國能達到卅餘年來所爭取的主權。」金氏回國後，除以顧問地位協助美軍當局推行政務外，還希望在短時期內召集全韓政黨代表大會，以期實現憲政。</p>
<p>使民生問題獲適解決</p>
<p>韓國臨時政府包括五個政黨：韓國獨立黨，朝鮮民族革命黨，新韓民主黨，朝鮮民族解放同盟，及朝鮮無政府者總聯盟。韓國獨立黨的領袖即金九氏，是目下最强的政黨。其次就是韓國臨時政府副主席，金奎植氏所領導的民族革命黨。花朝鮮本土尙有民主黨及建國委員會，這兩個政黨在朝鮮擁有相當勢力。同時共產黨在蘇聯占領下，當然格外抬起頭來。金氏現在所負的重任，是促進各黨各派的合作，使政黨的拉着手走上統一的大道。其次，是要設法解決韓國民衆的衣食住問題。金氏的期望是建立平靖統一的韓國，使它成爲遠東和平的基石。（銅岡爲金九）</p>

<h3>晨友盃籃球　甲組主力戰　華聯克東華</h3>
<p>華僑敗于德勝</p>
<p>晨友盃籃球開賽以來，甲組賽以昨日華聯東華之役，尤爲最刺激之一幕，球迷聞風而來者，不下千人，幸中靑當局，對于門票之售出，加以絕對限制，並請軍警到塲維持，以故秩序方面，殊見良好。兩塲結果如下：</p>
<p>德勝—華僑（甲組）二六—二一華聯—東華（甲組）五〇—二八</p>
<p>德僑之戰</p>
<p>德僑之戰，首先登塲，兩隊實力相差無幾，分數此起彼落，各不相讓，上半時完畢，德勝以一〇對八勝一球。下半時德勝採車輪戰術，頻頻換人，此法果見成效，結果華僑卒敗于德勝，比歟爲二六對二一。</p>
<p>華聨智取</p>
<p>前塲結束後，東華華聯登塲，觀衆精神，爲之一振，華聯主將李震中誤卯，華聯乘時崛起，孔廣益全長春各有妙射，瞬間以四—〇，八—二佔優勢，此後東華積極反攻，漸見眉目，惟終難超出，上半時完畢，華聯以二一對一六佔優。</p>

<h3>建設新敎育權威　（續昨）</h3>
<p>— 董任堅</p>
<p>體制往往是過去各種敎育活動的陳迹。它那種機構已經不能適應現在的社會需要了，而却繼續保持着它旣得的權益，逞着莫大的淫威，爲改進敎育的障礙：假使「敎育即是生活」，學校的性質應該改變，學級，學年，學績，學分亦應該增添不少的意義了。學校旣不是「象牙之塔」，它與社會爲什麼不能打成一片？敎育與政治爲什麼不能相互爲用？學生的活動爲什麼還要分課內課外？敎訓爲什麼不能合一？什麼是導師的任務？什麼是者試的作用？我們要會考嗎？我們應考些什麼？從考試裏我們果可以獲得些什麼？我們要視察，要督導：但是怎樣視？怎樣察？怎樣督？怎樣導？要曉得新八股，新私塾，新冬烘先生到處都是權威，結果它只浪費了兒童，浪費了靑年，浪費了人生——浪費了他們寳貝的時間，精力，習償，情緒，知識，意志！</p>
<p>當前敎育者的使命：打倒舊敎育權咸，把新敎育權威迅速建設起來！</p>

<h3>美輪將運物價抵華　物價呈普遍下降　煤荒問題可望解決</h3>
<p>兩團體昨招待蓉記者團</p>
<p>上海市商會。上海市地方協會，於昨日下午六時在浦東同鄕會招待成都記者團，到工商新聞各界領袖二百餘人，由杜月笙王曉　先後致歡迎詞，並作各種問題之研討，歷四小時之談話，對於物價煤斤輸店員生活工廠復樂，均有重要報吿。</p>
<p>上海物價開始下降</p>
<p>成都記者韓笑出（一）物價問題，（二）工廠復業問題。由徐寄庼作答，略謂：蔣主席曾電杜月笙先生，請以上海社會正義力量，制止物價上漲，經杜氏邀各界領袖，幾經研商，一面戢止上漲，一面疏通運輸，至今日已見大效，各種日用品開始劇跌，金市亦暴落，此後仍有續降之勢，五百萬市民生計，當可稍蘇。至工廠復業，已決定不問各廠產權如何，應均立即開工，從事生產。此外如失業工人之救濟，陸京士君曾多方設法。</p>
<p>大批物資即將來華</p>
<p>次由劉鴻生報告：煤荒問題經宋院長來滬令飭速謀救濟後，現正陸續南運，因產地交通治安關係，致產禮減少四分之三，現從多方面運輸，自下月起，儘可供給上海生產動力之用。此外運輸工具，亦爲平抑物價之重要問題。戰後輪隻，因外商各輪停航，佔戰前百分之七十五，僅存華商各輪，已覺其少，現已決定購美國自由輪三十艘，每艘九千噸，尙有海輪十八艘，每艘三千至五千噸，亦在洽購中。最足爲滬人吿者，即美國輪船九十艘，共中三十二艘，滿載麵麥，此外係海軍船，裝有預備美軍登陸用之房屋及其他日用品，均將抵華。對於中國物資之供應，關係甚大。亦足爲今後上海物價安定之助力。</p>
<p>程滄波氏同情店員</p>
<p>次新聞報指導員程滄波提出店同一般待遇問題及上海各銀行下午三時即行停業問題，希望各該業注意。經國貨公司李經理答復，謂六大公司已有統一辦法，職員蘑給自八千五百元起碼。次徐寄　答復銀行服務時間及待遇，練習生不及一年三千七百元，二年以上五千元，三年以上候補職員七千二百元，低級職員八千六百元，並謂銀行待遇，亦殊普通。</p>
<p>杜月笙氏致歡迎詞</p>
<p>嗣由杜月笙致歐迎詞，略謂抗戰時間川省支持全國人力物方，新聞界闡發國家民族之大義，對於記者團來滬考察，更表熱烈歡迎之意。中美日報查修盼杜王兩氏能隨時招待報界，使地方領袖爲社會服務之辛勤，爲各界所共知，杜王當表示願今後切實聯絡。</p>
<p>潘公展氏關心生產</p>
<p>次申報指導員潘公展應王曉籟之敦促，起立致詞，氏首言本人八在勝利之日，適在成都，與成都各界及新聞界均係夙識。嗣返陪都轉滬，本人過去從事新聞事業，退伍多年，現又重行入伍，今日與成都新聞界在此相見，至爲歡忻。潘氏次言內遷各廠，爲求今後各地工業平均發展，希望各廠主仍在川省繼續生產。末由嚴獨鶴僕　聲分別致詞，對成都新聞界抗戰期中之負獻表示敬佩。</p>
<p>滬謲政員建義八項</p>
<p>國民參政會在滬參政員奚玉書，陶百州等　，對本市物價問題，昨日聯電行政院宋隢長，翁副院長，建議八項：（一）宜增配航具，以暢貨運。（二）加緊各礦開採工作。（三）啓封敵僞物資應以低價發售。（四）接收敵僞工廠從速撥交民營。（五）民營工業，政府應在金融上予以合理之扶掖。（六）政府應儘以合理價格，核供外滙頭寸。（七）僞幣收兌辦法亟須改進。（八）須儘量增產闢源，以蘇民困。</p>
<p>平抑物價將再會商</p>
<p>上海市地方協會會長杜月笙，自接奉蔣主席令後，即連日與各界領袖交換意見，商討平抑物價有效辦法。據杜氏昨晚語本報記者，一二日內擬再度召集各業代表商討細密計　。外傳杜氏爲平抑物似，已組織一五人委員會，據悉不確。</p>
<h3>改善僞幣處理　決增加收換機關　願代收換者可向中行洽辦</h3>
<p>上海市商會前向財政部建議，改善處理僞幣辦法三點：（一）請增加收換機關，凡奉部核准繼續營業之行莊，中央銀行得一併委托代理收換。（二）代理收換行局收得僞鈔，按比率酌開國幣存款戶，需要時憑票或憑擢陸續支取。（三）請重申僞幣暫准流通明令。以上一二兩點經奉財部電復，原則上可照准，由該會逕洽中央滬行酌辦。第三點僞幣在收換截止期前，原可在市流通，應由談會轉知各業知照。上海市商會奉電後，業經推定常務理事金潤庠，監事駱淸華，會同與中央滬行洽辦中。聞中央銀行發行局方面，同時奉到電令後，昨已函知市商會轉吿各銀行錢莊，凡願代爲收換者，即來行接洽手續。市商會已分函銀錢兩公會，迅予轉知會員行莊矣。</p>
<p>小票面法幣應一律收受</p>
<p>上海市商會奉財政部駐京滬區財政金融特派員辦公處公函。以各行莊近有拒收五元。十元小票面法聯情事，殊屬不合。除公吿並令知銀錢兩公會傳飭各行莊，對於法幣面款不論大小，應一律收受，不得歧額視外，希轉知各商號，一律遵照。</p>
<p>掉換手續將予變更</p>
<p>僞幣收換手續改善，將自下月一日起實行，據大光社記者探悉，中央銀行發行局昨日上午，特爲此事在外灘十五號召集會議，現正訂擬辦法。改訂辦法中之特點，將爲各銀行得以僞幣轉賬，惟因轉賬而可能發生之弊害尙多。故現正在縝密研究之中。</p>
<h3>二十餘公會　電請弭平內亂</h3>
<p>上海市綢殷業·綿布業·紙業·呢絨業·絲廠藥·絲號榮·新藥業·糖業·荳米行業·國貨據膠製品業等二十餘同業公會，昨日聯合軍呈國府蔣主席，請予弭平內亂。</p>

<h3>進口貨無須特許　出口貨手續簡化　申請書仍須沿用</h3>
<p>〔本報特訊〕抗戰時期，政府為統制資起見，頒有進出口物品領證報運辦法，本年三月十三日，復經修正公佈，現在抗戰成功，此項統制辦法業經解決，對於進口貨已無特許進口之之規定，其出口貨方面，雖仍須繼續，但爲便利商人起見，其手續力求簡化，除申請書表，仍應沿用外，其他事項均總廢止，故已由財政部通令各省市，將上項修正特許進口物品領證報運辦法，正式廢止矣。</p>
<h3>黃金暴瀉　小去五萬元　證券外幣隨跌</h3>
<p>本埠黃金市價，較諸英美市塲，本已形成畸形的高價狀態，近以陪都供給特豐，而航運漸通，現鈔甚緊，以至逐步疲落，至昨日而大瀉矣。昨日各地辦貨客商皆有實貨傾出，借款多頭，山窮水盡，不得不忍痛了結，全日成一面倒，初開即降爲八一萬三，未幾即破入八十萬大關，中途以交易　落，進退殊微，迨午刻尙掙扎於七八萬五左右，浮多至此，始感恐慌，紛謀了結，致午後節節下瀉，最後較前日跌五萬之譜，此乃連朝不振後，浮多潰散之結果，而政府力謀壓低物價，亦不無影響，預期之中行掛牌，遲遲未見實行，買戶至此似已絕望，但劇跌後愼防回風，銀樓飾金連續掛低爲八萬三，銀元續降，但跌勢尙　，最後的四三〇元，紋銀掛牌亦減爲七百元。</p>
<p>外幣掙扎多日後，昨市亦吿潰滅，美鈔自晨初一三七〇元後，一蹶不振，最後維破入一千三大關，港幣除一九三〇年微降外，新幣亦似驚弓之烏，紛紛出籠，結果美鈔的跌七十元，一九三六及七年港幣跌五元，一九三〇年跌二十元，澳鎊三千一百元至四百元，羅比二八〇元至三三〇元，暗拆昨突鬆濫，良以投機家靜止已久，去路仍滯，最後已退入一角半內。</p>
<p>公價昨起回風，業中人獲利出龍，物價慘眣聲中，業外人亦不敢再度問津，形成供過於求，結果較前日下跌二十元至三十餘元不等，差似仍再軋攏。</p>
<p>華股亦受金債影響，買氣銷沉，結果的小半成至一成，前途亦難樂觀，復業之訊，勢非短時間內可以實現，散戶多頭持久力弱，有以致之也。昨在金價疲落中，人心虛軟，大戶觀望，少有問津，而散空則見活躍，以是價格向下，趨勢似在轉變中。</p>
<p>外股昨巨型股似呈瓦解狀態，跌度殊巨，尙無受主，小型股雖跌而尙平，惟亦供過於求。</p>
<h3>顏料有定貨</h3>
<p>顏料以近川帮略去，白水灘靛粉染面灰，快快靛五馬硃江西帮略去黑靛粉，其他客帮尙無見疲勢，至於本街廠需，實際尙有增加，但因本市洋行已有接收外洋定貨，實銷呆滯，唯經向染織業方面探悉，談稱現在少數洋行，所接之定貨，船期並未有定，手續久週，故前途如何殊堪考慮。</p>
<h3>川銷抬高　現鈔軋缺　物價呈予盾象</h3>
<p>邇來一般物價漲少跌多，市面有看平之象，經向金融界探悉，銀根並不甚緊，惟現鈔頭寸較爲缺乏，查係資金內流，往各鄕採辦農產物之故，據一般觀察現鈔頭寸之不裕，一時恐難解決，故紗布食糧等，昨均見疲，不易看好，但川銷貨物以滬渝間航運暢通，一經辦動，均紛紛報漲，一時頓呈矛盾之象，茲分誌如下。</p>
<p>紗市跌　紗市隨金價而下傾，買戶觀望不前，各方供給甚股，而川船帮及漢口帮，所裝之貨船已開，納胃稍呆，致粗細紗跌去二萬之譜，且以美綿至滬，行市者小，因之脚地不穏。</p>
<p>食米跌　食米來源仍旺，銷路呆滯，價續小五六百元，中檔貨小七百元，白元亦小五百元，麵粉納呆，亦小一二百元，油　以蚌埠油來貨甚多，價再小一二千元，生仁小千餘元，黃豆小三四百元，苞米乏榮辱，各糧供多於求，仍少樂觀。</p>
<p>絲價跌　昨日絲市以金價進入八關內，人心益軟，成交僅祇數担，行情跌勢吿勁，普通廠絲另担貨開六十七萬至七十萬元，降達十萬元間，又五担檔頭售七十五萬元，高級廠絲以將來有出口望，下降尙少，售一百萬至另五萬，輯里千經乏交市寂</p>
<p>青鉛跌　靑鉛趨勢，以製罐廠，油漆廠等用戶採辦零星，因之行情平疲，刻喊三萬元左右，至字鉛以文化機關有辦，趨勢穩健，喊售三萬六七千元許</p>
<p>五金漲　昨日五金市况，稍呈轉機，雖本街廠家交易依然未見進步，而客銷方面，則呈蓬勃氣象，如重慶帮納胃甚富，其所採辦若元釘白鉛絲白鉛皮馬口鐵之類，皆大批打包出口，蓋滬渝間航線，樂已暢通，往來瀕繁，兩地可以彼此互濟其窮，誠勝利後五金界之好現象也。</p>
<h3>雜貨市塲復員</h3>
<p>糖海南北雜貨同業聯合市塲，為糖業，北貨業，海味糨，南貨業，熟貨業，桂圓業，拆兌業，芝藤業，柏蠟等九個同榮團體所共同組織在南市中華路六十七號自建洋房，形式極爲宏大，主任葛維庵，及其他職員，俱由各公會公推，自南市倫陷後，遷往前法租界彤雲街廿三號，現以國土重光，將原址重加修飾，遷回舊地交易矣。</p>
<h3>美銀行存款　提取辦法兩項</h3>
<p>本市確息，美政府對於華人前此凍結在美國各銀行中之存款問題，最近業已決定辦法，儿存款在美金五百元以內者，得隨時自由提取，至於存款在五百元以上，而經存戶辦理聲請手續者，亦得同樣提取，以期有利於我華人之資金活動云。</p>
<h3>燃料難支</h3>
<p>煤市似在高峯盤旋，買戶因煤價連日狂升過巨，購買力轉弱意呈觀望，成交寥落，惟烟煤屑銷路仍活，樹柴到貨多潮濕，價略平疲，成交尙夥。</p>

<h3>抗戰的收穫</h3>
<p>— 黃嘉音</p>
<p>此次抗戰八年，中國在有許多方面可說是因禍得福。對外方面，中國因抗戰勝利而由次殖民地一躍而爲四强之一。對內方面，抗戰期間政府，敎育文化機關，以及人民的幾次大遷徒，已經使中國各地的民衆更能彼此相知，使中國更成爲一個眞正　統一的國家了。</p>
<p>就我個人來說，我前後到大後方去過兩次。第一次是經香港到桂林去，逗留了一個短時期；第二次是經河溜界首到重慶去，住了一個較長的時期。要是沒有這次抗戰，要中國沿海大都市的民衆成羣結隊遷居到廣西四川去，那簡直是難於想像的事。</p>
<p>初到內地去的人，大概都有『城裏人到鄉下去」的感覺。尤其是生長在大都會的環境中的人，對大多數的眞正的中國的民衆和土地，缺少接觸的機會，對於自己的國家，實在沒有正確的認識。在沒有到內地去過的人的想做中，中國所給他的印像，恐怕多數是由敎科書上得來的。這我敢擔保與實際的情形必大相逕庭。這就是所謂『百聞不如一見』的了。</p>
<p>我覺得此次抗戰的一大收穫，是中國的民衆對於自己的國家，有比較正確的認識了。這於國家民族的前途，是大有裨益的。</p>
<p>人物</p>
<h3>懷人</h3>
<p>— 葭水</p>
<p>近來，常要想起一位曾略略認識的英國女社會工作者來。</p>
<p>是麥利歐。來思德女士。她生於富家，幼年曾隨保姆出外，過倫敎東區時，車忽壞了，停下修理。保姆囑她不要亂動，免得沾着那貧民窟裏的汚濁氣息，以致生病。這使她生了極大的感觸。同樣是人，她留在那裏　分鐘都不合宜，那整日整夜整月整年生活在其中的男女老幼可怎麼樣呢？成年以後，她捨棄了安富尊榮的小姐生活，成了社會工作者，刖家中的財產，在倫敦東區，建立了一所金斯來堂，是專爲那裏的工人與勞苦大衆服務的。</p>
<p>她曾到過中國來，而且不祗一次。我知道的一次，是在一九三八年春。在東北與華北調查日人製造與販賣紅丸白而等毒物的事實，作成詳細的報吿書，給日本國內的開阻人士，英國政府，和世界各處的人知道。她就是這麼一位『務外』的，管理不千己的事的人。她同情印度的獨立運動，用言語與文字帮助這運動，和甘地是好友。</p>
<p>現在戰爭結束了，她曾寫信給我，勉勵我做中國的甘地。我恐怕不是一個符她的厚望的人，但我終不能不懷念這位白髮蕭蕭的女士，羨慕她生命的開拓，欽佩她那在不意之中處處流路的捨己忘身的精神，和那對追求自由與幸福的被壓逼者的極廣大的同情。</p>

<h3>希特勒中美人計</h3>
<p>— 今純</p>
<p>以前我們當聽到希特勒和他的　人的故事，但我們不知道他戀人中有一個却是間諜，而這間諜竟是蘇聯派去的。我想不似以前我們不知，即連中美人計的德國元首也在夢夢中吧，這消息是最近由蘇聯方面透露的。</p>
<p>柴齊巧華（Olga　Tschechowa）生於高加索，丈夫呌黎伯爾。柴齊巧華於一九二一年溜入德國，成爲著名的電影明星，不久變做希特勒最親密的女友。大戰時她充任蘇聯方而的間諜，刺探德國的虛實，德國一班大亨要請求希特勒甚麼事時，多半託她關說，而她遂將這些情報記在金盒裝的小簿子裏，差她的汽車夫秘密送往莫斯科。</p>
<p>蘇軍圍攻柏林時，柴齊巧華藏在某處防空壕內，柏林城陷，爲紅軍某上校救獲，護送回莫斯科去。</p>

<h3>科學新訊</h3>
<p>— 星聚</p>
<p>海洋的底，無法川照相機攝影，這在研究地質學和海洋生物學的終覺得是一種缺憾。但最近專攝海洋的照相機已發明，上面有發射電光的儀器，有一種特製的撥動機，一觸海底，照片那自動攝下。</p>
<p>醫學的進步，現在已可以將人體中的卵子移出，在體外施精，令其成熟，並可以觀察最初的二個細胞分裂經過。</p>

<p>文學</p>
<h3>談書　（一）</h3>
<p>— 未風</p>
<p>據編者吿訴我，自由談願意每星期六有一點地位讓出來，要我專門談新出版的書，而且以西書為限。這件事，我想，對於上海的朋友們，也許是有用的；d為被封鎖了這樣久，我們雖然還有能產刻得到外國出版的新書來看，先聽聽消息，也是件好事。</p>
<p>祇是在所謂大後方，看見外國新書也是一件難事。我因為工作上的便利，雖然看見得多些，可是還是太窄而且也太偏。因之今後談來，也就難免依舊限於「一眼眼」。</p>
<p>在戰時，英美的出版界並沒有多大的限制。同時因為物價統制得法，英國迄今生活指數祇上漲了百分之二十，美國祗有百分之十二。一般人民購買力未曾減弱，好書的銷塲也就依舊旺盛/銷到二三百萬同以上的書，單在去年，就有好幾種。</p>
<p>我現在假定每次介紹一本書，性質是不限的，不過寫起來，文藝的作品一定會較多些，每次擬祗寫五百字左右。假使讀者們有談書的短文寄來，或有什麼意見提供的話，我想編者先生同我，都是很歡迎的。</p>
<p>短篇名著</p>
<h3>敵人　（The　Enemy）（三）</h3>
<p>— 賽珍珠著　朱綺譯</p>
<p>『他受傷了，』貞雄驚呼這。他急急走近那人，那人一動不動的躺看，臉埋在沙裏。他頭上戴着的一頂舊帽子已浸透了海水。他穿着一身破燜的濕衣服。貞雄撙下去花子在他勞邊，將那人的臉熜轉來。他們看見了那張臉。</p>
<p>『一個白種人！』花子輕聲說。</p>
<p>是的，這是一個白種人。濕的帽子掉了下來，裏面是他的濕透了的黃頭髮，長得很長，好像已有幾個星期不曾修剪了’在他年輕痛苦的臉上，長着亂蓬蓬的黃鬍鬚。他已不省人事，一點不知道們們在做什麼。</p>
<p>現在貞雄記起了那傷，他就熟練地找尋起來。鮮血從他手觸到的地方流了出來。貞雄在那人右背的下部看見了一處槍傷，傷處已經重新迸裂了，那地方的皮肉已被火藥燒黑。沒有幾天以前，這人曾受槍擊，而且傷口沒有經渦治療。不幸岩石又正糧在這傷口上。</p>
<p>『哦，他血流得眞厲害！』花子又嚴肅地輕輕說道。現在霧已將他們完全遮掩起來，而且到了這個時刻，不會有人再經過這裏。漁人已經回家去了，甚至偶然經過的在海灘上揀取水上漂來的東西的人，也以為一天已經結束了。</p>
<p>『我們將他怎麼處置呢？』貞雄自言自語地說。可是他的受過訓練的手，却像是出於自己的意志似的，在盡力替那人止血了。他用海邊的每藻將那傷　包紮起來。那人在昏迷中呻吟起來，可是却沒有清醒。</p>
<p>『我們最好是把他再送回海裏去。』貞雄說，回答着自己的話。</p>
<p>現在血旣已止了，貞雄就站了起來，拍去了手上的沙土。</p>
<p>『是的，這樣自然最好，』花子隠定地說。可是她還是繼續瞪住那一動不動的人。</p>
<p>貞雄說：『如果我們的房子裏收留了一個白種人，我們就會被捕，要是我們把他當俘虜交出去，那他必死無疑。』</p>
<p>在子道；『最慈悲莫過於將他放回海裏去。』可是他們兩人都沒有動。他們又好奇又嫌惡地看着那毫無生氣的形體。</p>

<h3>National Army Vanguard Crosses Lianshan, Rapidly Advances Towards Huludao and Jinzhou; Communist Army on PingSui Railway Invades Datong</h3>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 3rd] According to news obtained by a United Press reporter from military circles, the National Army's 13th Corps, equipped with tanks, heavy artillery, and armored forces, is advancing towards Jinzhou. The vanguard of the National Army has already crossed Yunshan, with one part heading south directly towards Huludao, and another part advancing northeast towards Jinzhou. The National Army anticipates that the Communist Army will put up a strong resistance in Jinzhou. The main force of the Communist Army's armored divisions is currently concentrated in the Shenyang area, preparing to fully block the National Army's offensive.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tianjin, 22nd] The National Army has entered the territory of the Nine Eastern Provinces and by tonight has reached 180 *li*, pressing towards Jinzhou, the central point of the Beining Railway, where approximately 10,000 to 20,000 Communist troops are stationed. It is expected that this will be the first place they resist the National Army. So far, the Communist troops encountered by the National Army have been poorly equipped and trained. The National Army's main force is advancing rapidly along the railway line, and Communist troops' destruction of tracks and bridges is immediately repaired by the National Army's road repair teams. The major battle of Jinzhou is expected to begin at the end of next week. If the National Army can capture it individually without significant loss of strength, then reaching Shenyang, more than 600 *li* away, should be easy.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 23rd] According to reliable sources, General Ma Zhanshan is currently leading his troops to the territory of the Nine Eastern Provinces. It is also said that another Northeast guerrilla leader, General Wang Delin, has also mobilized his old troops to assist the National Army in taking over the Northeast. It is widely believed that General Ma Zhanshan still has great potential influence in the Northeast, especially in the Heilongjiang area.</p>
<p>[Further Dispatch] A high-ranking military official who recently returned here from Qinhuangdao told reporters: The Communist Army currently has two fully equipped divisions in the Northeast, and several armed brigades in North China, all of which are the most elite of the Eighth Route Army. He also said that all the armored vehicles, tanks, and artillery in the divisions were war materials that the Soviet Union received from the Japanese. Zhu De is currently in the Shenyang area, busy setting up the first line of defense near Jinzhou. The Communist Army intends to capture the National Army in one fell swoop when it reaches the railway line, but in any case, the National Army is currently deploying a three-pronged pincer movement to defeat their plan.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 3rd] According to a spokesperson for the 12th War Zone Headquarters, the main force of the Communist Army on the PingSui Railway is advancing towards Datong. In the Datong area, the Communist Army has deployed five tanks, driven by "foreigners of unknown nationality." In addition, 40,000 Communist troops are heading to Tangshan via Guan. Near Tangshan's Kaiping, 10,000 Communist troops have long been engaged in destroying roads. Around Shanhaiguan, the army is about 40,000 strong. The Communist Army forcibly conscripted farmers near the railway line between Tianjin and Qinhuangdao, forcing them to destroy the tracks. It is rumored that the Communist troops heading to Jehol looted grain along the way. The National Army had conflicts with the Communist Army in Miyun County, 90 *li* north of Peiping, but they were not intense.</p>
<h3>Sino-Soviet Negotiations; Rumors of a Joint Communiqué Being Issued</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Chongqing, 23rd] According to a local newspaper, China and the Soviet Union will soon issue a joint communiqué on the status of the Northeast and its joint administration. The Chinese and Soviet authorities are still in harmonious negotiations. The Soviet authorities are prepared to fulfill their treaty obligations. The fate of the Northeast depends on the political negotiations. If they proceed smoothly and are successful, then all major cities and towns in the Northeast can be defended by the National Army within a month and a half.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 23rd] Reliable sources report that Marshal Malinovsky, commander of the Soviet forces in the Transbaikal region, has telegraphed the officials in charge of receiving the Northeast to return to Changchun and continue negotiations. According to Chinese newspapers, when Xiong Shihui, director of the Northeast Headquarters, was still in Changchun, Malinovsky proposed that China and the Soviet Union jointly manage various mineral resources in the Nine Eastern Provinces. One newspaper reported that the central officials who went to Changchun from Chongqing to take over were treated very poorly. The Soviet side placed them in the former Japanese Coal Industry Office, where they were actually under surveillance. The entire staff of more than 300 people was provided with only one car, two trucks, and a few horse-drawn carriages. On November 16th, the Communist Army surrounded the airfield. These receiving officials were protected by the Soviet side and were able to return on ten aircraft.</p>
<h3>Communist Army Claims to Have Occupied Yancheng; National Army Relieves the Peril in Baotou</h3>
<p>Urgent appeals for sanctions from Ningxia, Henan, Singapore, and other places</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 23rd] The Communist Army announced today that the New Fourth Army has occupied Yancheng.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 23rd] Hundreds of thousands of people from the counties of Sizhou, Xuyi, Lingbi, Wuhe, Tianchang, Dingyuan, Jiashan, and other cities in Anhui Province have fled to the Tianjin-Pukou Railway due to the brutal killings by the Communist Army.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Luohe, 23rd] The Communist Army has now gathered more than 20,000 troops in Zaoyang and its surrounding areas of Qifanggang, Xiangyangzhen, and Heilongmiao, equipped with more than 1,000 machine guns, attempting to defend the Dahong and Tongbai mountains they have seized. In addition, the Fifth Division Guard Regiment and the core army of Li Xian's Communist Army have recently expanded their organization into the 33rd, 34th, and 35th Regiments, claiming that they will establish a base in the Dahong and Tongbai mountains, disrupt transportation, and attack the National Army as a backing for the Communist Party's negotiations with the government. Gong Yunjian, the Communist Party district chief of Queshan, and the leaders of Luchuan and Yuan Xinren surrendered to the Queshan County government on the 10th.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 23rd] After the National Army adopted the tactic of breaking through the encirclement in Baotou, the perilous situation in Baotou has been relieved.

<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 23rd] Passenger tickets are sold on the Beining Railway as far as Tangshan, but the Communist Army still harasses the area from time to time. On the evening of the 21st, a small group of them sneaked into the area between Chadian and Lutai, attempting to destroy the No. 18 and No. 19 railway bridges. Fortunately, they were discovered and driven away by the road repair team, so traffic between Tianjin and Tangshan has been unimpeded in recent days. However, passenger trains between Peiping and Tianjin have been delayed in the past two days due to the frequent appearance of Communist troops lurking along the line.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Dingyuanying, Alashan Banner, 23rd] Organizations such as the Ningxia Alashan Banner Farmers, Businessmen, and Workers Association have sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang, stating that the Communist Army is causing chaos and disturbing the country, and requesting that effective sanctions be taken quickly.</p>

<h3>Zhou Enlai Awaits Flight to Yan'an; Nineteen Companions, Ye Jianying May Come to Chongqing</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 23rd] Zhou Enlai is still waiting to fly to Yan'an in recent days. Because Zhou is traveling on an American P-47 aircraft, which flies to Chongqing from Shanghai, the aircraft has tried to fly three times but turned back to Shanghai due to thick ice forming on the aircraft in the highlands between Sichuan and Hubei due to the recent cold wave. Zhou is accompanied by fifteen staff members, and one reporter each from the Associated Press, United Press, the *Sun*, and the *New York Times*, totaling twenty people. It is heard that Ye Jianying may accompany Zhou to Chongqing as a representative of the Political Consultative Conference and to participate in the Three-Man Group military meeting. If Zhou can shorten his time in Yan'an, and if the Communist Party can accept the central government's intentions, the Political Conference may be convened on the first of next month.</p>
<h3>Being Considered by the Ministries of Finance and Economy; Conversion of Puppet Currency Funds; Leaders of Various Industries and Businesses Express Opinions for Reference</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] Since the promulgation that 200 puppet currency units equal one legal currency unit, most of the account balances in the city's industrial and commercial sectors have been adjusted since September or October. A small number of merchants will have to wait until the beginning of the year to sort things out. The most difficult issue to resolve is the conversion of capital. This newspaper's economic reporter learned from official sources that nearly 200 industry associations in the city have appointed reorganization committees, but it is said that membership registration in each association is not very enthusiastic. Similarly, the industrial and commercial registration to be organized by the Bureau of Social Affairs, as well as the business declaration of direct tax bureau, are also difficult to fill out because the capital conversion issue has not been decided. Regarding this issue, the reporter visited various relevant parties to explore opinions and summarized them as follows:</p>
<p>Concrete Measures Not Yet Decided</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the Accountants Reorganization Association, the association has organized a small group meeting to discuss the reorganization of capital amount many times. The plans proposed by various accountants also number dozens, but so far there is no concrete plan that is completely legal and easy to implement. However, after summarizing the various accountants' plans, the following is assumed: (A) If the funds are entirely legal currency, and were forcibly converted into puppet currency at a rate of 200 to 1, then the original amount of legal currency should be restored. (B) If the capital was originally legal currency, and the capital was increased after the circulation of puppet currency, in other words, in addition to the capital amount of legal currency being converted at a rate of 200 to 1, and then puppet currency was received as increased capital, the original capital should still be restored to the legal currency amount, and then the assets should be roughly estimated. If the situation is still good, then the increased amount of puppet currency capital received should be converted into legal currency at a rate of one to one. (C) If the funds were entirely collected after the circulation of puppet currency, then the assets should be largely estimated, and if the situation is still good, then they should be converted at a rate of one to one. If the above proposed method results in excessively high or low net assets, then procedures for increasing or decreasing capital should be followed. In short, all efforts should be made to simplify the conversion process to avoid multiple changes. As for the tax issue, in addition to the fact that excessively high net assets should be handled according to the method of raising stocks and distributing dividends, the government should exempt income tax and profit tax on the difference obtained from capital conversion.</p>
<p>Accounting Experts Express Opinions</p>
<p>The reporter also interviewed multiple accounting experts on this matter. According to them, if this method is studied from the perspective of accounting theory, there are certainly many issues that still need to be discussed. However, for the sake of simplifying the reorganization of industrial and commercial capital amounts, it is still a principle that can be adopted. If other exceptional problems are discovered during implementation, they can be handled separately. It can be seen from this that the difficulty of the capital amount conversion problem is not without obstacles to the recovery of industry and commerce. The City Chamber of Commerce has also telegraphed the Ministries of Economy and Finance to clearly indicate the method, but has not yet received a response, which shows that the government is also considering this issue carefully. The City Chamber of Commerce, for this capital amount conversion problem that is not easy to solve but must be resolved quickly, has specially proposed it for discussion in the Industrial and Commercial Laws and Regulations Research Committee organized by the chamber, and invited famous accounting law experts and industrial and commercial leaders in the city to jointly study it. A more reasonable method for resolving this capital amount conversion problem may be agreed upon soon.</p>
<p>Temporary Fluctuations Can Be Resolved</p>
<p>According to the executive director of the Chamber of Commerce, the business community in the city has already experienced a period of volatility since the clearly defined conversion rate for puppet currency was announced, but this only refers to the puppet currency circulating on the market. Now that it has been implemented and withdrawn, it will soon come to an end. As for the conversion of general property amounts in accounts, it is not necessary to convert them all according to this ratio. Moreover, in the case of banks and trust businesses, how to legally reorganize and convert the puppet currency capital received when puppet organizations forcibly increased capital is particularly difficult. I hope that if any industrial and commercial sectors have concrete methods, they will provide them as much as possible so that we can gather ideas and benefit from each other and make suggestions to the government. Because the various difficulties in the recovered area, especially the suffering caused by frequent changes in currency value, are best known to us merchants. Now the Chamber of Commerce has submitted a request to the Ministries of Economy and Finance for instructions. It would be unwise to criticize after the government's joint legal regulations are in place.</p>
<p>The Central Government Cares About the City's Industry and Commerce</p>
<p>According to the director of the Industrial and Commercial Laws and Regulations Research Committee of the Chamber of Commerce, the city's industry and commerce are very concerned and eagerly hope to reduce fluctuations as much as possible within the possible scope so that the restoration work can proceed smoothly. I sincerely hope that this capital conversion problem can be resolved as soon as possible. Recently, most of the visits and inquiries to the association have focused on this issue, but to find a completely satisfactory method that is both reasonable and legal, as the representative of the Accountants Association said, there is still no concrete method and further research is needed.</p>
<p>Reorganizing Funds Worth Considering</p>
<p>Pan, the person in charge of the City's Machinery Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association, said that the reorganization of the capital amount on the enterprise's books is indeed a problem worth worrying about. The association has discussed it many times, but there is no proper method. However, the idea of converting part of it at a rate of 200 to 1 is not well-considered. Because the 200 to 1 ratio is a redemption method determined by the central government in consideration of the suffering of circulating puppet currency in the recovered area. As for capital, in accounting terms, it is the balance of assets minus liabilities, and it is not the capital owner's existing currency. The form of capital has long been changed after several operations, and the value of net assets must be reorganized, so how can the method of reorganizing circulating currency be used to reorganize the capital amount? The association is currently gathering colleagues to discuss this issue in detail.</p>
<h3>Accountants Association; Decides on Processing Method</h3>
<p>The Reorganization Committee of the Shanghai Institute of Certified Public Accountants has decided and passed the method of converting enterprise puppet currency capital into legal currency. The decision on the current amount of enterprise capital can only be based on the net value of its existing assets and accurately account for its legal currency value as the basis for its legal currency capital. The proposed method is: (1) If the capital was originally legal currency and was later converted to puppet currency but the capital was not increased or decreased, the capital should be restored to its original legal currency amount. (2) If the capital was originally legal currency and was later converted to puppet currency and the puppet currency capital was increased, the net value should be estimated in legal currency based on its existing assets. If this net value is sufficient to cover the original amount of puppet currency capital on the books, it may be converted to legal currency at the original amount of puppet currency. If the amount is insufficient, the investors should make up the full amount in legal currency or reduce their capital amount. (3) If the capital was puppet currency from the beginning, it should be handled in accordance with the provisions of the second item above. The processing and adjustment of enterprise capital should be carried out by the person in charge of the company or enterprise, who should convene a meeting of shareholders or investors to submit the capital processing method for approval and then implement it in order to avoid disputes. In the future, when the monetary system is stable and the tax system is revised, the net value of assets will be accurately accounted for and the amount of capital will be adjusted to achieve the goal of accounting accuracy, which is the only wish of our accountant colleagues.</p>

<h3>Editorial: The Control of Atomic Energy</h3>
<p>Our Minister of Foreign Affairs recently sent a note to US Secretary of State Byrnes stating the Chinese government's views on the control of atomic energy, declaring two points: (1) The Chinese government hopes that the Atomic Energy Management Committee under construction will be established immediately to ensure that this kind of energy is transferred away from destructive goals and used for peaceful and humanitarian purposes; (2) The Chinese government fully recognizes that the only way to thoroughly protect civilization from being destroyed by scientific knowledge is to abandon war. This can only be achieved by consolidating and expanding the power of the United Nations organization. This note reaffirms our country's basic principles for dealing with international issues: that is, in order to maintain international justice and human civilization, we advocate that the use of atomic energy should be shifted from its destructive goals to goals that benefit mankind; war should be abandoned, and the organizational power of the United Nations should be consolidated and expanded. The National Government has never had selfish motives in dealing with international issues, but stands on the position of maintaining international justice and human civilization. This is not only supported by the people of the whole country, but also warmly supported by other general countries.</p>
<p>We have often heard of other countries' foreign policies: such as the US Monroe Doctrine and Open Door Policy, and the British Balance of Power, etc. If someone asks what our foreign policy is, we can say that it is to maintain international justice and human civilization. In the past, we could say that we had no foreign policy. In the situation of a semi-colony, we were always in a passive position in international politics. We could only act passively and could not provide our opinions actively. Now the situation has changed. In the past few years, our country's activities in international politics have gradually solidified into our country's foreign policy, which is a very gratifying thing.</p>
<p>In the treacherous international politics, many hidden reefs will inevitably form, most of which are caused by hegemonic thinking. Our advocacy of maintaining justice is not entirely an empty voice, but expresses the wishes of many small and weak nations. Maintaining justice and seeking the welfare of mankind are originally lofty moral values. Our foreign policy is to maintain these moral values. The solidification of this policy is due to the principle of impartiality and peace in our country's Three People's Principles. Impartiality is neither biased nor partisan, and it is precisely the advocacy of justice; harmony is harmony, and peace is balance. From the starting point of impartiality and peace, we advocate that there should be coordination internationally, and these basic moral values should be maintained. However, the solidification of this policy has also been through painful experiences. In the past, because international justice was not upheld, there was the "September 18th Incident"; because international justice was not promoted, it led to foreign aggression. Therefore, the solidification of this policy is the result of a hundred years of humiliation, eight years of war, and the shedding of countless blood. This represents the ideal of our nation, and at the same time, it can be said to represent the hope of mankind.</p>
<p>Regarding the control of atomic energy, we should especially focus on the standpoint of international justice and the welfare of mankind. Since the dropping of two atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the entire future of mankind has changed. The use of atomic energy may bring infinite happiness to mankind, or it may lead to the destruction of the entire human race. Just think about it, one atomic bomb almost destroyed the entire Hiroshima, killing and injuring more than 300,000 people; then the entire country, the entire world, could be destroyed by a very small number of atomic bombs. Mankind has entered a new era due to the use of atomic energy. This era will be a watershed in human history. If atomic energy is used for the benefit of mankind, future generations will see today's humans as if modern humans see humans in the Stone Age.</p>
<p>Because atomic energy is very destructive, if it is used as a weapon, it will be a decisive factor in future wars. Whoever can manufacture a large amount of atomic bombs can control future wars. Therefore, the views of various countries on the control of atomic energy may not be the same. Although the success of using nuclear energy to manufacture atomic bombs was in the United States, it was achieved through international cooperation. The United Kingdom supplied talent, Canada supplied talent and necessary materials, and the United States also supplied talent and materials; in addition, there were Italian scientists, German Jewish scientists who fled abroad, and Danish scientists. Especially because the success of atomic bomb manufacturing was in the United States, the United States seemed to regard it as a magic weapon bestowed by God. It obtained this magic weapon due to God's entrustment, to use it to maintain world peace. The Soviet Union did not participate in this international cooperation, so it demanded openness. On the point of openness and secrecy, there is actually no dispute. No scientific invention can maintain long-term secrecy; the question is how to shift the goal of its use, from its destructive properties to seeking peace for mankind and seeking welfare for mankind. On this point, our government's views on the control of nuclear energy are indeed worthy of our praise.</p>
<p>But the main point of the problem is still that mankind should repent and have a new outlook on life and a new outlook on the country because of the successful use of atomic energy. Because atomic energy is very destructive, human life should be thoroughly reformed and strive for harmony. The failure of the Axis countries to control the world with hegemonic tactics should awaken other countries that think of controlling the world with hegemonic tactics, and no longer commit the same mistakes. The success of atomic bomb use should also awaken their futility of their attempts: however, even now there may still be countries that think of controlling the world with thunderous tactics. The atomic bomb has changed the world, and the atomic bomb should change people's hearts even more. We especially feel resentment and regret that in such an atomic age, how should our whole country unite and cooperate in the arduous task of nation-building and catch up? We were originally an industrially backward country, and people have already reached the use of atomic energy, while we are still stuck in the state of handicrafts. Now that the eight-year War of Resistance has ended victoriously, it is the time to work hard for rehabilitation and move towards the road of nation-building, but there are still people with ulterior motives who sabotage transportation and rebel with troops. The people are already longing for governance, how can they endure war again. The atomic bomb should awaken them!</p>
<p>Whether mankind can abandon war is not the question we want to answer. In the international aspect, if we want to prevent war, we can only strengthen the power of international organizations. Because of the use of atomic energy, the organizational power of the United Nations should be strengthened and consolidated. This is the most effective international method of controlling atomic energy. In our government's statement on its views on the control of atomic energy, this is another point that is worth praising. The incompetence of the past League of Nations failed to prevent the outbreak of the Second World War. Now, because of the use of atomic energy, we cannot repeat the mistakes of the past. We must strengthen and consolidate the organizations of the United Nations, so that mankind can avoid mutual slaughter and enter a new era; mankind can benefit from the successful use of atomic energy.</p>

<h3>The British House of Commons Debates the Washington Atomic Bomb Declaration; Attlee Calls on All Countries to Respond</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Reporter Ren Lingsun, London, 22nd Dispatch] British Prime Minister Attlee, when deliberating in the House of Commons at noon on the 22nd, reported on his trip to the United States and called on all countries to broadly endorse the principles outlined in the statement on atomic energy jointly issued in Washington by himself, US President Truman, and Canadian Prime Minister King. The House of Commons was packed when the British Prime Minister delivered his speech. He told those present that what the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada discussed during the Washington talks was not only the future policy on atomic energy, but also the greater issue of eliminating world wars. From Attlee's point of view, the atomic bomb has made the general public realize that if civilization is to be maintained, a world war must never be allowed to recur. "If countries do not act in good faith and are determined not to use the threat of war as an instrument of policy, the international community will not be able to effectively control the atomic bomb and other destructive weapons." According to the Prime Minister, the Washington Conference was held at his suggestion.</p>
<p>Eden's Speech Targets the Soviet Union</p>
<p>Former Foreign Secretary Eden then spoke, suggesting that the veto power stipulated in the United Nations Charter should be abolished to adapt to the situation after the discovery of atomic energy, and called on all countries to frankly state their current views on sovereignty. Eden also discussed relations with the Soviet Union, saying: The Soviet Union's suspicion and distrust of its two major allies, the United Kingdom and the United States, who jointly achieved victory, is deepening, which is undeniable and deeply regrettable. He firmly believes that the peace of the future depends on the understanding between the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union. We know that the Soviet Union's preparations are not to deal with us, and we also hope that it will deepen our preparations, which are also not to deal with the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Full Text of the British Prime Minister's Speech</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 23rd Dispatch] British Prime Minister Attlee declared in the House of Commons last night that all weapons of total war are sufficient to destroy everything. If we want civilization to continue to exist, we must eliminate total war and prevent it from appearing in the world again. None of the weapons applicable to total destruction can occupy any legitimate position among the necessary weapons used for ordinary maintenance of internal security and protection of the government against illegal actions. He then described the details of his consultations with the US President on atomic energy, saying, "I think it is impossible to turn the atomic bomb into a simple issue without mentioning other weapons for destruction. In the past, there was a time when the weapons used in war were very primitive in our eyes today. The losses and destruction caused by war could often be repaired and restored in a few years. Although the pain was great, it was still limited, and sometimes the losses were even minor. Those in power calculated the cost of war and compared it with the benefits they obtained, and it was still worth using. In fact, the so-called benefits are not worth mentioning today. This attitude towards war can no longer be held in our generation."</p>
<h3>To Maintain Civilization and Prevent War from Recurring</h3>
<p>The atomic bomb is now the latest term for destructiveness, but this may not be the last. As of today, there is no way to deal with it. Therefore, if we want civilization to continue to exist, we must prevent the recurrence of the First and Second World Wars. Therefore, when I addressed the US President, spoke at the City Hall, and in various discussions, I always thought about what kind of world order is necessary in the new era when science has placed such tragic weapons in human hands, not only must the atomic bomb be eliminated from the armories of all countries. I emphasize this point because there have been many attempts to eliminate certain weapons or certain war behaviors and have achieved some success in the past. In the past, there have been several wars in which both sides were able to faithfully abide by the Geneva Conventions, but the attempt to eliminate certain weapons can be said to have failed. Before the outbreak of the war from 1914 to 1918, the use of gas warfare was prohibited, but it was still used later. I dare say that if the Nazis thought it was worthwhile to use gas, they would have used it again in this war. Today, the power of bombing a city is enough to fill the world with terror, and in this war, the citizens of London have tasted this every day. I do not believe that in a world of war, except for a very limited scope, the "Queensberry Rules" (this rule was originally used for boxing matches) can be applied.</p>
<h3>If There is No Good Faith, Control Will Be Difficult to Achieve</h3>
<p>We should now pay attention to the fact that in a war of comparable scale to this war, all kinds of weapons will be needed. The large-scale use of atomic bombs will inevitably result in the complete destruction of large cities, the deaths of tens of millions of people, and the regression of civilization to an unimaginable era. Even if we exhaust our efforts, we cannot find a safe way to effectively guarantee the prevention of a country that is determined to invade from manufacturing atomic weapons. Since all countries are faced with the tragic reality of destructive science, they will urgently realize that it is imperative to find a way to get rid of the poison of war from the world.</p>
<p>The meetings of the United Nations organizations are now undoubtedly aimed at eliminating war. I use the words "firmly adhere to this" because in my opinion, this is the core of the problem. Just like the inspection or control system of weapons, it is difficult to be effective without sincerity. However, no matter how carefully all international organizations are formed, if all countries are not determined not to use war or the threat of war as an instrument of policy, and if all countries are determined to treat each other with mutual trust and prevent war from happening, then there will be no benefit. This is the only true solution, and all defense methods that contain any chance of success cannot be ignored or underestimated, but mutual trust is ultimately necessary.</p>
<h3>Mutual Exchange of Knowledge Between the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada</h3>
<p>We should remember that there is already a vast area of trust on the ground today, that is, there will never be a day when war will break out between us and any autonomous territory. There will never be a day when war will break out between the United Kingdom or Canada or any other autonomous territory and the United States. (Applause) Broadcasting this trust to the world seems to be the work that any politician should do. The Washington Declaration was made to increase trust so that we can work harder to keep the fear of war away from the world. In this declaration, the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom jointly stated that they are willing to exchange basic scientific knowledge and consult with any country willing to reciprocate to send scientists to exchange knowledge. The Prime Minister then said that the development of atomic energy for peaceful purposes is unlikely to be realized without many years of research, or it may not be realized in a few years. The procedures and methods currently under development should lead to this purpose. People from several sides have suggested that the knowledge of this method should be made known to all, like basic scientific information. However, I do not think it is wise to tell the world by radio broadcast. First, this knowledge cannot be made clear to people in the form of ways, manuals, or blueprints. It can only guide scientists and technicians to a factory to explain everything in detail before they can understand it. And there are only a limited number of people with this expert knowledge. It is impossible to do this without their personal presence, and it takes a long time. If this is done to various countries, it is obviously extremely difficult, and I also think that it should not only be done to a specific number of countries. Second, this invention can be used for peace and war.</p>
<h3>It is Obviously Not Appropriate to Disclose Weapon Secrets at Present</h3>
<p>The United Nations organization has just been born and has not yet left its cradle. Is it wise to advertise to the world the procedures for manufacturing destructive weapons? We mean that this must wait until there is greater trust and greater security guarantees between countries. Now we should ask, what kind of guarantee can be slightly effective? Have you not said that it is actually impossible to think of a guarantee system that is sufficient to be effective? I ask the whole House to pay attention to the words in the third section of the joint declaration, so that we can know that without mutual trust, no system can be effective. Although the method of creating atomic energy is quite complicated and requires a large airport, the finished product is quite small. The bomb in Hiroshima was not very heavy, but controlling this extremely dangerous substance obviously requires extreme caution. However, the countries that signed the Washington Declaration have stated that once an effective guarantee that can be implemented can be agreed upon, they are willing to share the methods of actually using this invention in industry with all countries on a reciprocal basis. In order to achieve this goal, we have suggested setting up a committee in the League of Nations organization. The Prime Minister then asked the whole House to pay special attention to the regulations that the committee's work should be carried out step by step. He also emphasized that special actions should be based on the need for trust. The Prime Minister also asked the whole House to note that the committee will not only deal with atomic energy, but will also involve all weapons applicable to total destruction. At this point, the Prime Minister repeated the original declaration, and said, "This is our declaration, and I hope the world will respond to this principle. Now I specially put forward here a suggestion to spread scientific information for peaceful purposes and to prevent its misuse in war, and I hope that all countries will accept it."</p>

<h3>Nazi Party Members Have Many Conspiracies; They Plan to Bomb the Nuremberg Court; They All Know that the Lives of War Criminals Are Difficult to Save; Destroying the Court Will Make the Leaders Die Together</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 23rd Dispatch] The Nuremberg Court now employs many German civilians. One of them, a nineteen-year-old girl named Rommel, works as a librarian. She recently told a reporter from the Daily Mail stationed in Nuremberg that we are all afraid of encountering misfortune because the Nazis in Bavaria and Nuremberg will try to bomb the court. I know that you British have never thought about how much you are envied here, and you have never expected how many lawless people are lurking around you. They have not acted yet, but we believe that they will act when they see how the war criminals are being tried. They all know that most of the war criminals will not be able to save their lives, so they will not hesitate to destroy the court and make their former leaders die together. The trial of the Nazi leaders has entered its fourth day today. Presiding Judge Lord Lawrence announced that the trial will be suspended for one day tomorrow. US prosecutor Wallace continued to describe the process of Nazi conspirators controlling Germany.</p>
<h3>Korean Leader Kim Gu</h3>
<p>— Wu Jiatang</p>
<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] Chairman Chiang's special plane, which had been staying in Shanghai for four days, took off from Shanghai at 8:00 AM yesterday morning under the warm sunlight, carrying Kim Gu, Chairman of the Korean Provisional Government, and four of his staff members, heading east. When Mr. Kim left Jiangwan Airport, he indicated that he might return to Shanghai again soon, but the date was still difficult to determine. He stated that his future policies will be aimed at promoting friendly relations between China and Korea as the most important goal; at the same time, he expressed his deep gratitude to the various military and political leaders in Shanghai for their warm hospitality.</p>
<p>A Shocking Scene in Hongkou Park</p>
<p>Kim Gu—a fresh revolutionary leader—Chairman of the Korean Provisional Government, amidst cheers of victory, was the first to win the banner of freedom and independence for his country and returned to Seoul yesterday.</p>
<p>Although he is already in his seventies, his face still reveals a rare composure, fully demonstrating superhuman perseverance. It immediately reminds people of the shocking bombing case at Hongkou Park in Shanghai thirteen years ago. On April 29th of the 21st year of the Republic of China (1932), Kim Gu's "slaughter the Japanese" policy achieved its greatest success.</p>
<p>No one can forget this time of exceptional achievement. Shirakawa returned to his country in a coffin after being injured in the explosion, Consul General Shigemitsu lost a leg, and Admiral Nomura became one-eyed.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang is a Great Leader</p>
<p>Shanghai occupies an important position in the history of the Korean revolution. The first Korean Provisional Government was initially organized in Shanghai. Other underground anti-Japanese activities were also first planned in Shanghai. In the past, our government and the Kuomintang continuously provided assistance to Korean revolutionary patriots, so Mr. Kim said to reporters very sincerely: "Chairman Chiang is a great leader and a good friend of Korea!"</p>
<p>Mr. Kim faces many difficult problems upon returning to his country this time. Although Korea has now been liberated, it is still under Soviet-American military occupation. Because the two sides cannot compromise with each other, it has laid the foundation for a crisis of direct conflict. Mr. Kim told reporters: "We are returning to our country this time at the invitation of the US military authorities, using our personal connections to seek the unification of Korea."</p>
<p>Striving for Independence and Freedom Through Our Own Efforts</p>
<p>The 38th parallel has now become the dividing line between North and South Korea; South Korea, under US military occupation, includes Gyeongsang North and South, Jeolla North and South, Chungcheong North and South, and Gangwon provinces. This is Korea's agricultural area, with a population of over 20 million, accounting for two-thirds of the total Korean population. North Korea is an industrial area, currently under Soviet rule. It has the largest hydroelectric power plant, chemical plant, textile factory, fertilizer factory, airplane manufacturing plant, military industrial plant, and gold mines. Since agriculture and industry have been divided into two military and political regions with no communication, farmers in South Korea feel panic about industrial products, while workers in North Korea are extremely short of food and other agricultural products.</p>
<p>Mr. Kim clearly understands the complexity of these issues and that they cannot be resolved in a short period. He said: "We hope that a proper solution can be produced within the framework of the United Nations so that Korea can achieve the sovereignty it has been fighting for for more than 30 years." After returning to Korea, in addition to assisting the US military authorities in implementing administrative affairs as an advisor, he also hopes to convene a national congress of all Korean political parties in a short period to realize constitutional government.</p>
<p>Ensuring Appropriate Solutions to People's Livelihood Issues</p>
<p>The Korean Provisional Government includes five political parties: the Korean Independence Party, the Korean National Revolutionary Party, the New Korea Democratic Party, the Korean National Liberation Alliance, and the Korean Anarchist Federation. The leader of the Korean Independence Party is Kim Gu, which is currently the strongest political party. The second strongest is the National Revolutionary Party, led by Kim Kyu-sik, the Vice-Chairman of the Korean Provisional Government. In Korea itself, there are also the Democratic Party and the Committee for National Construction, which have considerable influence in Korea. At the same time, the Communist Party, under Soviet occupation, is naturally raising its head. The important task that Kim Gu is currently burdened with is to promote cooperation between all parties and factions, so that the political parties will join hands and move towards unification. Secondly, he needs to find ways to solve the problems of food, clothing, and housing for the Korean people. Kim Gu's hope is to establish a peaceful and unified Korea and make it a cornerstone of peace in the Far East. (Written by Tonggang for Kim Gu)</p>
<p>Education and Sports</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education to Implement the Second Phase of National Education Starting in January Next Year</h3>
<p>Eliminating Illiteracy Thoroughly, Regardless of Rear Areas or Recovered Areas</p>
<p>[Chongqing Airmail from Dahuashe] The first phase of the National Education Plan implemented by the Ministry of Education will expire at the end of this year. The second phase of National Education implementation has now been planned, and notifications are being sent to education departments and bureaus in recovered areas and provinces and cities in the rear area to implement it starting in January next year.</p>
<p>[Chongqing Airmail from This Newspaper] The Ministry of Education has ordered all provinces and cities in the recovered areas to step up the implementation of national education and thoroughly eliminate illiteracy. According to the implementation guidelines, national education is divided into two parts: "compulsory education" and "remedial education for illiterate people." It should be implemented simultaneously in the National Primary Schools and Township (Town) Central Schools, and the compulsory education part should be enriched as soon as possible. All school-age children aged six to twelve should receive four, two, or one year of compulsory education, except for those who may receive six years of primary school education. Illiterate people aged fifteen to forty-five should also receive primary or advanced public remedial education in stages, but it should first be implemented for men and women aged fifteen to thirty-five, and then continue to older people. Illiterate children aged twelve to fifteen may be given appropriate compulsory education or remedial education for illiterate people, depending on the actual local situation and their physical and mental development. This national education has been implemented in the Great Rear Area for many years. The people of the recovered areas should follow the guidelines and supplement the implementation of this national education.</p>
<h3>Registration for Temporary University Preparatory Classes Begins</h3>
<p>According to the person in charge of the Temporary University Office yesterday: Registration for the Temporary University preparatory classes has now begun. Among the students reporting, there are more from Jiaotong University, about one hundred, followed by more than two hundred from the National Medical College, more than one hundred and fifty from the Shanghai Business College, more than one hundred from the Conservatory of Music, seventy from the German Medical College, and only more than ten from Lei Shude. It is also heard that Minister Zhu will discuss future school administration policies and the hiring of professors after the registration procedures for the Qianming Temporary University preparatory classes are completed.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Plans to Utilize Enemy Buildings to Establish Various Educational Facilities</h3>
<p>[Chongqing Airmail from Dahuashe] The Ministry of Education recently stated that the establishment of various educational facilities in major cities in the past has always suffered from the lack of suitable addresses, and many have been forced to compromise. Since the Japanese invaders entered, the number of immigrants has increased, scattered in key locations, or established schools at all levels to educate their overseas Chinese, or established various institutions to implement governance. The buildings and houses are distributed in various cities. Now that the enemy and puppets have withdrawn, their buildings can be used as much as possible, considering what is appropriate, to establish various educational facilities. The planned method is as follows: (1) If the location is suitable and meets the needs, the school will still be a school, the group library will still be a library, and the reading room will still be a reading room. (2) If the old school site, old library, etc. are not suitable, they can be moved to suitable houses built by the enemy. (3) The ministry will transfer the order to the Executive Yuan to inform the receiving agencies and local officials to give priority to educational administrative agencies and provide all conveniences.</p>

<h3>Chenyou Cup Basketball, A Main Battle in Group A, Hualian Beats Donghua</h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese Lost to Desheng</p>
<p>Since the start of the Chenyou Cup basketball game, the game between Hualian and Donghua in Group A yesterday was the most exciting. No less than a thousand fans came upon hearing the news. Fortunately, the Zhongqing authorities imposed absolute restrictions on the sale of tickets and asked the military and police to maintain order at the venue, so the order was very good. The results of the two games are as follows:</p>
<p>Desheng—Overseas Chinese (Group A) 26—21 Hualian—Donghua (Group A) 50—28</p>
<p>The Desheng vs. Overseas Chinese Battle</p>
<p>The Desheng vs. Overseas Chinese battle took the stage first. The strengths of the two teams were similar, and the scores rose and fell, each refusing to give way. At the end of the first half, Desheng won by one goal with a score of 10 to 8. In the second half, Desheng adopted a rotational warfare tactic, frequently changing players. This method proved effective, and Overseas Chinese eventually lost to Desheng, with a score of 26 to 21.</p>
<p>Hualian Wins with Wisdom</p>
<p>After the end of the previous game, Donghua and Hualian took the stage, and the audience's spirits were greatly lifted. Li Zhenzhong, the main player of Hualian, made a mistake, and Hualian took the opportunity to rise. Kong Guangyi and Quanchang each had wonderful shots, taking the advantage of 4-0 and 8-2 in an instant. After that, Donghua actively counterattacked and gradually saw signs of progress, but it was still difficult to exceed the advantage. At the end of the first half, Hualian took the lead with a score of 21 to 16.</p>
<p>After the rest, Hualian played steadily, looking for openings to score. Donghua still relied on a surge of blood and rushed around, causing the forbidden door to open wide. Hualian's score gradually increased. The biggest difference was 38-20. Donghua still fought like a trapped lion, and Li Chongyouliang had another masterpiece, but time was not on its side, and it was still no match for Hualian. In the end, Hualian won with a score of 50 to 28.</p>
<h3>Building New Educational Authority (Continued from Yesterday)</h3>
<p>— Dong Renjian</p>
<p>The system is often the remnants of various past educational activities. Its institutions can no longer adapt to the current social needs, but it continues to maintain its vested interests, exerting great power and becoming an obstacle to improving education: If "education is life," the nature of the school should change, and grades, academic years, academic performance, and credits should add more meaning. Since the school is not an "ivory tower," why can't it be integrated with society? Why can't education and politics be used for each other? Why should students' activities be divided into in-class and out-of-class? Why can't teaching and learning be combined? What is the task of the tutor? What is the role of testing? Do we want to take the university entrance exam? What should we test? What can we get from the exam? We want to inspect and supervise: but how to inspect? How to observe? How to supervise? How to guide? You must know that new eight-legged essays, new private schools, and new pedantic teachers are all authorities everywhere, and as a result, they only waste children, waste young people, and waste life—waste their precious time, energy, habits, emotions, knowledge, and will!</p>
<p>The mission of current educators: Overthrow the old educational authority and quickly build up the new educational authority!</p>

<h3>The United States Will Ship Materials to China, Prices Will Generally Decline, and the Coal Shortage Problem Is Expected to Be Solved</h3>
<p>Two Groups Hosted the Chengdu Journalists' Delegation Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and the Shanghai Local Association hosted the Chengdu Journalists' Delegation at the Pudong Fellow Villagers Association at 6:00 p.m. yesterday. More than 200 leaders from industrial, commercial, and journalistic circles attended. Du Yuesheng and Wang Xiaolai delivered welcome speeches successively and discussed various issues. After four hours of talks, important reports were made on prices, coal, shop assistant life, and factory resumption.</p>
<p>Shanghai Prices Begin to Decline</p>
<p>Han Xiao, a journalist from Chengdu, raised (1) the price issue and (2) the factory resumption issue. Xu Jiyin replied briefly: Chairman Chiang telegraphed Mr. Du Yuesheng, asking him to use the power of social justice in Shanghai to stop the price increase. After Mr. Du invited leaders from all walks of life and deliberated several times, he curbed the increase on the one hand and dredged transportation on the other. Today, great results have been seen, and the prices of various daily necessities have fallen sharply. The gold market has also plummeted. In the future, the downward trend will continue, and the livelihoods of five million citizens can be slightly restored. As for factory resumption, it has been decided that regardless of how the property rights of each factory are, they should all start work immediately and engage in production. In addition, Lu Jingshi has tried many ways to relieve unemployed workers.</p>
<p>A Large Number of Materials Are Coming to China</p>
<p>Next, Liu Hongsheng reported: After President Song came to Shanghai and ordered a quick solution to the coal shortage problem, coal is now being transported south one after another. Due to transportation and security conditions at the place of origin, the output has been reduced by three-quarters. It is now being transported from various sources. From next month, it will be available for Shanghai's production power. In addition, transportation is also an important issue in stabilizing prices. After the war, due to the suspension of foreign merchant ships, the number of ships accounted for 75% of the pre-war number. Only Chinese merchant ships remained, which felt scarce. It has now been decided to purchase 30 US Liberty ships, each with 9,000 tons, and 18 sea-going ships, each with 3,000 to 5,000 tons, are also being negotiated for purchase. What is most sufficient for the people of Shanghai to be informed of is that 90 US ships, 32 of which are fully loaded with flour and wheat, are naval vessels and are equipped with houses for US troops to land and other daily necessities, will arrive in China. This is greatly related to the supply of Chinese materials. It is also helpful for stabilizing prices in Shanghai in the future.</p>
<p>Cheng Cangbo Sympathizes with Shop Assistants</p>
<p>Next, Cheng Cangbo, a guidance member of the Xinwen Bao, raised the issue of equal treatment for shop employees and the issue of Shanghai banks closing at 3:00 p.m., hoping that the industries would pay attention to it. The manager of the Guohuo Company replied that the six major companies have unified methods, and the monthly salary for employees starts from 8,500 yuan. Next, Xu Jiyin replied about bank service hours and treatment: 3,700 yuan for trainees for less than one year, 5,000 yuan for more than two years, 7,200 yuan for probationary employees for more than three years, and 8,600 yuan for junior employees. He also said that bank treatment is also very ordinary.</p>
<p>Du Yuesheng Delivers a Welcome Speech</p>
<p>Then, Du Yuesheng delivered a welcome speech, saying that during the war, Sichuan Province supported the national human and material resources, and the press expounded the great righteousness of the country and the nation, expressing a warm welcome to the journalists' delegation to Shanghai for investigation. Cha Xiupan of the Sino-US Daily News hoped that Du and Wang would be able to host the press at any time, so that the hard work of local leaders in serving the community would be known to all walks of life. Du and Wang expressed their willingness to actively communicate in the future.</p>
<p>Pan Gongzhan is Concerned About Production</p>
<p>Next, at the urging of Wang Xiaolai, Pan Gongzhan, a guidance member of the Shen Bao, stood up to deliver a speech. He first said that he happened to be in Chengdu on the day of victory, and he knew all walks of life and the press in Chengdu. After returning to Peidu and then Shanghai, he had been engaged in journalism in the past, and now he has re-enlisted after many years. He was very happy to meet the Chengdu press here today. Pan then said that in order to seek the balanced development of industries in various places in the future, he hoped that the factory owners would continue production in Sichuan Province. Finally, Yan Duhe and others delivered speeches respectively, expressing their admiration for the contributions of the Chengdu press during the war.</p>
<p>Shanghai Council Members Suggest Eight Items</p>
<p>National Council members in Shanghai, Xi Yushu, Tao Baizhou, etc., sent a joint telegram to Song Yaolun, President of the Executive Yuan, and Vice President Weng, regarding the price problem in this city, suggesting eight items: (1) It is appropriate to increase the allocation of navigation equipment to facilitate freight transport. (2) Step up the mining work of each mine. (3) The enemy and puppet materials should be unsealed and sold at low prices. (4) The enemy and puppet factories should be transferred to private operation as soon as possible. (5) The government should give reasonable financial support to private industries. (6) The government should核 supply foreign exchange head positions at reasonable prices as much as possible. (7) The method of collecting and redeeming pseudo-currency urgently needs to be improved. (8) It is necessary to increase production and expand sources as much as possible to relieve the people's difficulties.</p>
<p>Price Stabilization Will Be Discussed Again</p>
<p>Du Yuesheng, chairman of the Shanghai Local Association, has been exchanging opinions with leaders from all walks of life and discussing effective ways to stabilize prices since receiving the order from Chairman Chiang. According to Mr. Du's statement to our reporter last night, he plans to convene representatives from various industries again in one or two days to discuss detailed plans. It is rumored that Mr. Du has organized a five-person committee to stabilize prices, which is said to be inaccurate.</p>
<h3>Improving the Handling of Pseudo-Currency, Deciding to Increase Redemption Agencies, Those Who Are Willing to Redeem on Behalf Can Contact the Bank of China</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce previously suggested three points to the Ministry of Finance to improve the method of handling pseudo-currency: (1) Please increase the redemption agencies. Any bank that has been approved by the ministry to continue operating, the Central Bank may entrust to redeem on behalf. (2) The banks that redeem on behalf shall open a national currency deposit account in proportion to the pseudo-currency received, and withdraw funds by bill or by draw as needed. (3) Please reiterate the explicit order that pseudo-currency is temporarily allowed to circulate. The Ministry of Finance replied to the above two points, in principle, it can be approved, and the association shall directly negotiate with the Central Bank Shanghai to handle it. Before the deadline for the redemption of the third point of pseudo-currency, it could originally circulate in the market, and the association should inform all industries to be aware of it. After receiving the telegram, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce has appointed standing director Jin Runxiang and supervisor Luo Qinghua to negotiate with the Central Bank Shanghai. It is heard that after the issuance bureau of the Central Bank received the telegram order at the same time, it has yesterday sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to inform all banks and money shops that those who are willing to redeem on behalf should come to the bank to handle the procedures. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has sent letters to the two public associations of banks and money shops, and quickly notified the member banks and money shops.</p>
<p>Small Denomination Legal Tender Should Be Accepted Unconditionally</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce received a letter from the Finance and Finance Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Finance stationed in the Beijing-Shanghai area. Recently, banks have refused to accept 5 yuan and 10 yuan small denomination legal tender, which is very inappropriate. In addition to 公吿 and ordering the two public associations of banks and money shops to inform each bank, all legal tender face value shall be accepted unconditionally, regardless of size, and shall not be discriminated against, and hope to inform all merchants to comply with it.</p>
<p>Redemption Procedures Will Be Changed</p>
<p>The improved pseudo-currency redemption procedures will be implemented from the first of next month. According to a report from the Dagang News Agency, the Issuance Bureau of the Central Bank held a special meeting at No. 15 Bund yesterday morning for this purpose, and is now formulating methods. The characteristics of the revised methods will be that each bank can transfer pseudo-currency, but there are many abuses that may occur due to the transfer. Therefore, it is now being carefully studied.</p>
<h3>More Than Twenty Associations Send Telegrams Requesting to Quell the Internal Chaos</h3>
<p>More than twenty trade associations in Shanghai, such as the silk industry, cotton cloth industry, paper industry, woolen industry, silk factory medicine, silk number, new medicine industry, sugar industry, soybean rice industry, national goods, rubber product industry, etc., jointly sent a telegram to the National Government Chairman Chiang, requesting to quell the internal chaos.</p>
<h3>Gu Zhenggang Flies to Shanghai from Qingdao</h3>
<p>Minister of Social Affairs Gu Zhenggang left Shanghai on the 11th and flew to Ping, then to Tianjin, and flew to Qingdao. Now I know that Mr. Gu flew back to Shanghai from Qingdao by plane at 4:00 p.m. yesterday. He Zhonghan, director of the Labor Bureau of the Ministry, and Wang Long, head of the statistics department, also flew with him.</p>
<h3>General Lokey Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday, Wedemeyer Waits for Reporters Today</h3>
<p>Major General Lokey, commander of the Third Amphibious Force of the United States Overseas Forces, flew to Shanghai from Tianjin yesterday afternoon and briefly spoke with General Wedemeyer, commander of the US military in the China war zone, at the airport. Mr. Lokey has accepted Chairman Chiang's invitation and is scheduled to fly to Chongqing today for a meeting. General Wedemeyer is scheduled to receive Chinese and foreign reporters in the Construction Building on the eighth floor at 11:00 a.m. today.</p>
<h3>Navy Seals Warehouse, Executive Yuan Orders Transfer by Telegram</h3>
<p>The Navy Headquarters previously received materials from warehouses sealed in Shanghai. It has recently been learned that President Song telegraphed two days ago, limiting them to hand over the enemy and puppet property processing bureau and customs inspection within 24 hours. According to Dagang News Agency's inquiry to the Shanghai Office of the Navy Headquarters, the spokesperson of the office said that the handover procedure is tentatively scheduled to end in one week, and all matters can be handed over by the end of this month.</p>
<h3>Foreign Banks to Resume Operations</h3>
<p>According to a representative of the Special Commissioner's Office for Finance in the Beijing and Shanghai Region, the office has exchanged views with representatives of various foreign banks regarding the resumption of operations of foreign banks in this city, and plans to resume operations in a short period of time. After the resumption of operations, all foreign banks will join the Shanghai Banking Association and receive the same treatment as Chinese banks.</p>
<h3>Central Bank to Relocate</h3>
<p>The current building of the Central Bank on Renji Road, the Bund, was originally built by the Bank of China before the war. Three years ago, it was occupied by the puppet Central Reserve Bank. Last month, the Central Bank took over the bank and borrowed it for office and business purposes. It is now learned that the Central Bank has decided to return the building to the Bank of China, and the Central Bank will move to the former Yokohama Specie Bank site.</p>

<h3>No Special Permits Required for Imported Goods, Simplified Procedures for Exported Goods, Application Forms Still Required</h3>
<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] During the Anti-Japanese War, in order to control resources, the government promulgated measures for obtaining licenses and reporting the transportation of imported and exported goods. On March 13th of this year, it was revised and promulgated again. Now that the Anti-Japanese War has been won, these control measures have been resolved. There are no special import permit requirements for imported goods. Although export goods still require continued procedures, in order to facilitate merchants, the procedures are simplified as much as possible. Except for the application forms, which should still be used, all other matters are abolished. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance has issued a circular to all provinces and cities, officially abolishing the above-mentioned revised measures for obtaining licenses and reporting the transportation of specially permitted imported goods.</p>
<h3>Gold Prices Plunge, Down 50,000 Yuan, Securities and Foreign Currencies Follow</h3>
<p>The market price of gold in Shanghai was already abnormally high compared to the British and American markets. Recently, with the abundant supply from the wartime capital Chongqing and the gradual opening of shipping, cash has become very tight, leading to a gradual decline. Yesterday, prices plummeted. Yesterday, merchants from all over the country who were handling goods were dumping actual goods. Speculators who had borrowed money were at their wits' end and had to reluctantly liquidate. The entire day was one-sided. The opening price immediately fell to 813,000 yuan, and soon broke through the 800,000 yuan mark. In the middle of the day, trading was sluggish, with little progress. By noon, prices were still struggling around 785,000 yuan. Speculators finally felt panic and scrambled to liquidate, causing prices to fall sharply throughout the afternoon. In the end, prices were down by 50,000 yuan compared to the previous day. This was the result of the collapse of speculators after days of weakness. The government's efforts to lower prices also had an impact. The long-awaited listing by the Central Bank has not yet materialized, and buyers seemed to have given up hope. However, after the sharp decline, caution should be exercised to prevent a rebound. Silver shops continuously lowered the price of gold ornaments to 83,000 yuan. The price of silver dollars continued to fall, but the decline was still limited. The last price was 430 yuan. The listed price of silver bullion was also reduced to 700 yuan.</p>
<p>After struggling for many days, the foreign currency market also collapsed yesterday. The US dollar fell from 1,370 yuan at the beginning of the morning and never recovered, finally breaking through the 1,300 yuan mark. The Hong Kong dollar also seemed like a frightened bird, rushing to sell off, except for the 1930 issue, which declined slightly. As a result, the US dollar fell by 70 yuan, the 1936 and 1937 Hong Kong dollars fell by 5 yuan, the 1930 issue fell by 20 yuan, the Australian pound fell by 3,100 yuan to 3,400 yuan, and the Rupee fell by 280 yuan to 330 yuan. The black market discount suddenly loosened yesterday, because speculators had been idle for a long time and the way out was still blocked. In the end, it retreated to within one and a half jiao.</p>
<p>Public bonds rebounded yesterday. Professionals took profits and sold off. Amid the cries of plummeting prices, non-professionals did not dare to inquire again, forming a supply-over-demand situation. As a result, prices fell by 20 to 30 yuan compared to the previous day. It seems that the difference will still be squeezed.</p>
<p>Chinese stocks were also affected by gold and bond prices, and buying interest declined. As a result, prices fell by half a percent to ten percent. The outlook is not optimistic. The news of resumption of operations cannot be realized in a short period of time. Retail investors have weak staying power, which has led to this situation. Yesterday, amid the weakness of gold prices, people were weak and major investors were watching, with few inquiries, while retail short sellers were active. As a result, prices are trending downward, and the trend seems to be changing.</p>
<p>Yesterday, large-cap foreign stocks seemed to be disintegrating, with significant declines and no buyers. Small-cap stocks fell but were still stable, but supply still exceeded demand.</p>
<h3>Pigments Have Orders</h3>
<p>Pigments from Sichuan Province are slightly declining, with White Water Beach indigo powder dyeing surface ash, Kuai Kuai indigo, vermilion from Jiangxi Province are slightly declining black indigo powder, and other provincial pigments have not shown fatigue. As for the needs of local factories, there is actually an increase, but because foreign firms in this city have received foreign orders, actual sales are sluggish. However, after inquiring with the dyeing and weaving industry, they said that the delivery dates for the orders received by a few foreign firms are not fixed and the procedures take a long time, so the future situation is worth considering.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Sales Rise, Cash Shortage, Prices Show Contradictory Signs</h3>
<p>Recently, general prices have risen less and fallen more, and the market shows signs of leveling off. After inquiring with the financial community, credit is not very tight, but there is a shortage of cash. It is found that funds are flowing inward, going to various villages to purchase agricultural products. According to general observations, the shortage of cash is unlikely to be resolved in a short time. Therefore, cotton yarn, grain, etc. were all weak yesterday and are not easy to be optimistic about. However, Sichuan sales goods are rising due to smooth shipping between Shanghai and Chongqing. Once they are mobilized, they are all reported to be rising, creating a contradictory situation for a time. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn Falls: Cotton yarn fell along with gold prices. Buyers are watching and not moving forward. Supply from all parties is very strong, and the ships loaded with goods by Sichuan and Hankou merchants have already departed. Demand is slightly sluggish, causing the price of coarse and fine yarn to fall by 20,000 yuan. Moreover, American cotton has arrived in Shanghai, and the market is small, so the footing is unstable.</p>
<p>Rice Falls: The source of rice is still strong, sales are sluggish, and prices continue to fall by 500 to 600 yuan. Medium-grade goods fell by 700 yuan. White rice also fell by 500 yuan. Flour is slow to move, and also fell by 100 to 200 yuan. Oil: There is a lot of oil coming from Bengbu, and the price has fallen by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Raw peanuts fell by 1,000 yuan. Soybeans fell by 300 to 400 yuan. Corn lacks prosperity. The supply of all grains is greater than demand, and there is still little optimism.</p>
<p>Silk Prices Fall: Yesterday, the silk market entered the eight-point range due to gold prices, and people's hearts were weakened. Only a few loads were transacted, and the decline was strong. Ordinary factory silk opened at 670,000 to 700,000 yuan per load, a drop of 100,000 yuan. Another five loads were sold for 750,000 yuan. High-end factory silk is expected to be exported in the future, so the decline is small, selling for 1 million to another 50,000 yuan. Jili silk lacked trading and the market was quiet.</p>
<p>Lead Falls: The trend of lead is that users such as can factories and paint factories are purchasing sporadically, so the market is stable and weak, currently shouting around 30,000 yuan. As for type lead, cultural institutions are buying, and the trend is stable, shouting sales of 36,000 to 37,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Hardware Rises: Yesterday, the hardware market situation showed a slight turnaround. Although transactions by local factories still did not improve, the guest sales side showed a prosperous atmosphere. For example, Chongqing merchants have a very rich demand. The goods they purchase, such as round nails, white lead wire, white lead skin, and tinplate, are all being packed and exported in large quantities. The Shanghai-Chongqing shipping line is now smooth, and exchanges are frequent. The two places can help each other out of their difficulties, which is a good phenomenon for the hardware industry after the victory.</p>
<h3>Grocery Market Resumes</h3>
<p>The Sugar, North and South Grocery Joint Market is jointly organized by nine Rongtong groups: the sugar industry, the northern goods industry, the seafood industry, the southern goods industry, the cooked food industry, the longan industry, the exchange industry, the sesame vine industry, and the beeswax industry. It built its own Western-style building at 67 Zhonghua Road in Nanshi, with a very grand format. The director, Ge Weian, and other staff members were publicly recommended by the various associations. After Nanshi fell, it moved to 23 Tongyun Street in the former French Concession. Now that the country has been restored, the original site has been refurbished and moved back to its old location for trading.</p>
<h3>Two Ways to Withdraw US Bank Deposits</h3>
<p>According to reliable information from Shanghai, the US government has recently decided on a method for dealing with the problem of Chinese people's deposits frozen in US banks. Deposits of US$500 or less can be withdrawn freely at any time. As for deposits of more than US$500, depositors who apply for it can also withdraw them in the same way, in order to facilitate the capital activities of our Chinese people.</p>
<h3>Fuel Difficulties</h3>
<p>The coal market seems to be hovering at its peak. Buyers are turning weak and watching because coal prices have risen too much in recent days. Transactions are sparse, but the sales of bituminous coal powder are still active. Firewood arrives mostly wet, and prices are slightly stable and weak, but there are still many transactions.</p>

<h3>The Harvest of the Anti-Japanese War</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiayin</p>
<p>During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, China can be said to have benefited from misfortune in many aspects. In terms of foreign affairs, China jumped from a semi-colony to one of the four major powers due to its victory in the Anti-Japanese War. In terms of domestic affairs, the several major migrations of the government, educational and cultural institutions, and the people during the Anti-Japanese War have made the people of various parts of China more aware of each other, and made China a truly unified country.</p>
<p>Personally, I have been to the rear area twice. The first time was through Hong Kong to Guilin, where I stayed for a short period of time; the second time was through Heliujieshou to Chongqing, where I lived for a longer period of time. If it were not for this Anti-Japanese War, it would be simply unimaginable for the people of China's coastal metropolises to move to Guangxi and Sichuan in groups.</p>
<p>People who go to the interior for the first time probably have the feeling of "city people going to the countryside." Especially people who grow up in the environment of a metropolis lack the opportunity to contact the majority of the real Chinese people and land, and they do not have a correct understanding of their country. In the minds of people who have not been to the interior, the impression of China is probably mostly derived from textbooks. I dare to guarantee that this is very different from the actual situation. This is the so-called "seeing is believing."</p>
<p>I feel that one of the greatest gains of this Anti-Japanese War is that the Chinese people have a more accurate understanding of their country. This is of great benefit to the future of the country and the nation.</p>

<h3>Remembering People</h3>
<p>— Jia Shui</p>
<p>Recently, I often think of a British social worker I once knew slightly.</p>
<p>It's Miss Mary Oliver. She was born into a wealthy family. When she was young, she went out with her nanny and passed through the East End of London. The car suddenly broke down and stopped for repairs. The nanny told her not to move around, lest she get infected with the turbid breath of the slum and get sick. This gave her a great feeling. She was a human being too, and she shouldn't stay there for even a minute. What about the men, women, old, and children who live there all day, all night, all month, and all year round? After she grew up, she gave up her comfortable and honorable life as a young lady and became a social worker. She used her family's property to establish Kingsley Hall in the East End of London, which was dedicated to serving the workers and the working masses there.</p>
<p>She had been to China, and not just once. The one time I knew about was in the spring of 1938. She investigated the facts of the Japanese manufacturing and selling red pills and white pills and other poisons in Northeast China and North China, and made a detailed report to the Japanese people, the British government, and people all over the world. She was such an "external" person, managing things that were not her own. She sympathized with the Indian independence movement, helped the movement with words and writing, and was a friend of Gandhi.</p>
<p>Now that the war is over, she wrote to me, encouraging me to be the Gandhi of China. I'm afraid I'm not a person who lives up to her high expectations, but I can't help but miss this gray-haired lady, admire her life's development, admire her spirit of selflessness and self-sacrifice that flows out everywhere unexpectedly, and her extremely broad sympathy for the oppressed who seek freedom and happiness.</p>

<h3>Hitler Falls for a Honey Trap</h3>
<p>— Jin Chun</p>
<p>In the past, we have heard stories about Hitler and his lovers, but we did not know that one of his lovers was a spy, and this spy was actually sent by the Soviet Union. I think that even the German leader who fell for the honey trap was dreaming, even though we didn't know it before. This news was recently revealed by the Soviet side.</p>
<p>Olga Tschechowa was born in the Caucasus. Her husband's name is Leiber. Tschechowa slipped into Germany in 1921 and became a famous movie star. Soon, she became Hitler's closest girlfriend. During the war, she served as a spy for the Soviet Union, probing the reality of Germany. When a group of German tycoons wanted to ask Hitler for something, they mostly asked her to intercede, and she recorded this information in a gold-boxed notebook and sent it secretly to Moscow by her chauffeur.</p>
<p>When the Soviet army besieged Berlin, Tschechowa was hiding in a certain air-raid shelter. When Berlin fell, she was rescued by a Soviet colonel and escorted back to Moscow.</p>

<h3>Scientific News</h3>
<p>— Xing Ju</p>
<p>The bottom of the ocean cannot be photographed with a camera, which has always been a regret for researchers in geology and marine biology. However, a camera that specializes in photographing the ocean has recently been invented. It has a device that emits electricity and a special motor that automatically takes a picture when it touches the bottom of the sea.</p>
<p>With the progress of medicine, it is now possible to remove eggs from the human body, fertilize them outside the body, let them mature, and observe the first two cell divisions.</p>
<p>A serum for preventing paralysis has been successfully tested and has been tested on some animals.</p>
<p>Medical scientists studying the fluorescence emitted by the white matter in the human brain have discovered a medium called plaque. It is said that this discovery reveals a new dawn for the treatment of nerves.</p>

<h3>Talking About Books (1)</h3>
<p>— Wei Feng</p>
<p>According to the editor, Free Talk is willing to have a little space every Saturday to let me talk specifically about newly published books, and limited to Western books. I think this is probably useful for friends in Shanghai; because we have been blockaded for so long, even though we can still get new books published abroad, it's still a good thing to hear the news first.</p>
<p>It is also difficult to see new foreign books in the so-called rear area. Because of the convenience of my work, I see more, but it is still too narrow and too biased. Therefore, in the future, it will inevitably be limited to "one eye."</p>
<p>During the war, the British and American publishing industries did not have much restrictions. At the same time, because price controls were effective, the cost of living in the United Kingdom has only increased by 20%, and the United States only 12%. The purchasing power of the general public has not weakened, and the sales of good books are still strong. Several books have sold more than two to three million copies last year alone.</p>
<p>I now assume that each time I introduce a book, the nature is unlimited, but when I write, literary works will definitely be more. Each time I plan to write only about 500 words. If readers send in short essays about books, or have any opinions to offer, I think the editor and I would be very welcome.</p>
<p>Short Masterpiece</p>
<h3>The Enemy (3)</h3>
<p>— Pearl S. Buck, translated by Zhu Qi</p>
<p>"He's injured," Sadao exclaimed. He hurried closer to the man, who lay motionless, his face buried in the sand. An old hat on his head was soaked in seawater. He was wearing broken, wet clothes. Sadao squatted down beside him and turned the man's face around. They saw that face.</p>
<p>"A white man!" Hana whispered.</p>
<p>Yes, this was a white man. The wet hat fell off, revealing his wet blond hair, which was very long, as if it had not been cut for several weeks. His young, painful face was covered with a disheveled blond beard. He was unconscious and had no idea what they were doing.</p>
<p>Now Sadao remembered the wound, and he searched for it skillfully. Blood flowed from the place he touched. Sadao saw a gunshot wound on the lower right back of the man, which had burst open again. The skin and flesh there had been blackened by gunpowder. This man had been shot a few days ago, and the wound had not been treated. Unfortunately, the rock was pressing on the wound.</p>
<p>"Oh, he's bleeding really badly!" Hana said softly and solemnly again. Now the fog had completely covered them, and at this moment, no one would pass by here again. The fishermen had already gone home, and even those who occasionally passed by to pick up floating objects on the beach thought the day was over.</p>
<p>"What shall we do with him?" Sadao said to himself. But his trained hands, as if of their own volition, were doing their best to stop the man's bleeding. He bandaged the wound with seaweed from the beach. The man groaned in a coma, but did not wake up.</p>
<p>"We'd better send him back to the sea." Sadao said, answering his own words.</p>
<p>Now that the blood had stopped, Sadao stood up and patted the sand off his hands.</p>
<p>"Yes, that would naturally be best," Hana said calmly. But she continued to stare at the motionless man.</p>
<p>Sadao said, "If we take a white man into our house, we will be arrested. If we turn him over as a prisoner, he will surely die."</p>
<p>In her heart: "The most merciful thing is to put him back into the sea." But neither of them moved. They looked at the lifeless body with curiosity and disgust.</p>
<h3>Social Services: Future Working Guidelines; Advocating for Seven Social Undertakings</h3>
<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>Student Aid Funds Remain the Focus of Work; Wishing for Guidance from Social Elites</p>
<p>The re-publication of this newspaper and the daily meetings with our beloved readers are truly a great joy. The expectations that everyone places on us are both profound and sincere, and naturally, our commitment to serving everyone should be equally far-reaching. For example, concerning "Social Services," there are truly countless things we should and want to do, and it's hard to know where to start. I recall that the establishment of the "Social Services Department" of this newspaper was still three years ago, precisely during the period of full-scale war and the decline of people's livelihoods. My colleagues, while diligently holding their posts, devoted their spare energy to six relief projects. Although no special effects were seen, it was merely an attempt to fulfill the responsibility of advocacy. Now, the War of Resistance has been won, the sun has shone again, and everything is waiting to be rebuilt. This is truly the initial stage of restoration and construction. The colleagues of this department have always regarded serving society as their mission, and they are willing to exert their meager efforts, following behind the readers, and do their best. However, my colleagues have limited talent and abilities. I sincerely hope that social elites will often provide guidance to correct any shortcomings!</p>
<p>In the past, this newspaper specially established a "Social Services Department" and a "Reader Student Aid Fund Office," dividing labor and cooperating to do their best. From now on, these two departments will be merged into one, called the "Social Services Section." The working guidelines are briefly described as follows: (1) Reader Student Aid Fund... In accordance with the past student aid purposes, providing assistance to poor, talented, and out-of-school youth, and cultivating talent for the country, this task is the focus of the department's work.</p>
<p>(2) Orphan Education Aid Fund... Rescuing orphans without parents and homeless street children, providing appropriate education so they can become useful people.</p>
<p>(3) Medical Aid Fund... Providing relief to the generally poor and sick, providing medical treatment and medicine, and guiding them towards health and happiness.</p>
<p>(4) Student Health Check-up... Specially contracting with major hospitals to provide physical examinations for aided students and treat illnesses.</p>
<p>(5) Small Loan Fund... Providing loans to unemployed poor people to run small businesses, giving them the opportunity to make a living, repaying the principal in installments, without interest.</p>
<p>(6) Maternity Aid Fund... Helping poor pregnant women, providing free delivery, and providing guidance on prenatal and postnatal hygiene and infant care knowledge. The greatest virtue of heaven and earth is life, so this aid fund has the highest intention of protecting mothers and children.</p>
<p>(7) Martial Arts Training... Promoting public sports, advancing national health, specially inviting experts to provide guidance, without any fees.</p>
<p>In summary, we are willing to work tirelessly and do our best. We hope that the public will provide material assistance and spiritual encouragement. Let us all join hands and move forward on the road of serving society!</p>
