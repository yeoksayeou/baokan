<h3>展望戰局的現階段（四）　上海日本陸海外三報道部長座談</h3>
<p>神風攻擊隊的恐怖</p>
<p>松平：還有這樣的話哩，就是爲了硏究新兵器，製造新兵器，所以過去的定單以及舊兵器的調整等，一律取消，從新定製新的，而軍需生產醫而有了若干低落。不過，對於神風特攻隊及敢死空挺隊，他們雖然受書不小，倒還一言不提呢。</p>
<p>松島：祇有一個某國駐外武官說過，他說敵方因神鷲陸海軍特攻隊而受到很大的損害。祇有這一點，此外一言不及。</p>
<p>松平：他們倘若說出來，一定要麻煩的。如果報道出來，就足沮喪士氣了。</p>
<p>松島：關於剛才的英美海軍均衡問題，最近英國宣稱已有世界第一的戰艦進水了。英國所以要如此宣布出來，無非是對付美國的一種姿勢呀。</p>
<p>松島：然而，敵軍已因我方的攻勢而　壁了，所以遊擊式的轟炸日本軍需生產地帶或空襲上海。對於敵機的濫炸，我們日本人當然有所覺悟。最近，在日本本部及上海方面，因敵機的濫炸而受害的人們，有什麽心理呢？知道嗎？據新聞界傳稱，上海方面對此相當怨恨。迄今爲止，民衆都以爲不會濫施轟炸，不料最近竟在難民區丟起炸彈來了，因而非常憎恨</p>
<p>出淵：在轟炸上海以後，聽說中國方面的要人大　其怒。非常憤怒哩，據說如果那樣玉石不分的濫炸，一定要取戰手段。</p>
<p>松平：所以應該省悟敵機遊擊式的空襲。對於此事，最好的防禦法就是防禦戰鬥，其次便長完備的防空設施</p>
<p>松島：總之，要增男足防空飛機，此外就是設法將受害區域盡可能的限於炸彈落下的地點。重要設的疏開以及物資的分散格納，都是必要的。最近關於十一日及廿一日的空襲，敵方的廣播相當詳細。這大的是從延安或山東的某地廣播出來的。據其廣播說：「上海海軍報道部長松島在空襲時最好不要跑到高處觀望。」由此看來，他們的情報倒也相當詳細呀。</p>
<p>松平：以前，漢口方面聽說有敵方的人員潛入，在空襲時施放火箭作信號。這的確要嚴加戒備才好……</p>
<p>松島：命令多得很呢。他們命令遊擊隊詳細調査何處有工廠，何處有倉庫，何處貯物資，並且還吩咐他們用什麽東西標明出來。</p>
<p>松平：不久以前，有一個情報說，曾有這樣的工作人員五六十名派到當地來。總之，在遊擊戰以外，謀略，宣傳戰也相當活潑。現在，大東亞戰爭巳入第四年，決戰的階段今年將到最後的地步吧。是不是？</p>
<p>松島：今年大概可以決定了。戰爭雖將繼續下去，但總可有個分曉了。</p>
<p>出淵：現在來看一看美國的國內情勢如何。昨日我接到一個電報，據十一月二十五日的通訊，美國徵兵局長二十二日的兵備講演—不知是軍事講演或什麽—稱；戰爭開開始以來，免除兵役的人數已達百四十四萬。又，七月三日「生活」週刋題爲殘慶免除兵役者的待遇問題的一則記事中，聲稱美國已有一百二十五萬餘人免除兵役。</p>
<p>松平：英國方面，免除兵役者佔召集數的八分之一。</p>
<p>敵美動員　最大兵力</p>
<p>出淵：美國徵兵局長又稱美國十月一日的兵員總數共計一千一百八十五萬。這個已動員的兵力全是壯丁，美國人口若以一萬萬二千萬計算，則和人口總數的比例爲十比一，即五個男子中已有一個　召集。</p>
<p>松平：不過進一萬萬二千萬是連黑人也計算在內的。</p>
<p>出淵：總之，可說動員兵力已達最大的限度了。若將動員兵力的損耗率及國內由戰勝觀所產生的和平氣氛等思想問題一併加以考慮，則美國國內盡可能短期內結束戰爭的氣氛相當濃厚，不難想見。因此，在這第四年內，不論在大陸方面或太平洋方面，他們將不惜犧牲。總之，在這第四年中，大東亞戰爭將現出最大決戰的樣相。目下的日本本部空襲等，　其一端。從而對於大陸各地的轟炸，當然也要激烈起來的。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>新市政與新人事</h3>
<p>自從國府明令發表市政長官更迭以後，一般市民都寄以很熱烈的期待。前日行政院會議，復通過本市警察，財政，經濟，公用各局及物品配給處等局處長人選。更予滬市民耳目一新。</p>
<p>我們站在上海市民的立塲，對於地方官，本來就有一種協力的心理。除非這個地方官不能盡其責任，自然也能影響協力的心理，而變成疏遠的心理。這次滬市調任的各局長官，聽說都是富有行政經騐，操守相當規矩的人物，那末，我們當然表示歡迎與欣慰，同時，更寄以極大的期待。</p>
<p>不過，我們表示歡迎與欣慰，並不是爲了新的人物，而是爲了能盡其地方官的責任。怎樣盡其地方官的責任？上海市目前的現狀以及急待解決的課題，我們已經屢决指陳，足以提供各長官的參考。各局長官蒞任以後，爲行政效率着想，對於所屬人事方面，或將更有若干調整。我們願就所見略陳如次：</p>
<p>第一，一個機稱，領導的人固然處於重要地位，但是，担任實際執行工作的幹部人員，同樣處於極重要地位。譬如科長階級的公務人員，秉承長官的方針，指示屬下執行，一面體會上級命意，悉力推行，一面熟悉下級能力，妥善支配。對上謹愼負責，對下以身作則。政令推行的迅捷與緩慢，周密與疏漏，完全繫於科長階級的才具，所以，他的能力與操守，極爲重要，我們希望對此幹部人選，特別愼　錄用。一面對於不稱職者，乘機淘汰，一面對於原有的稱職者，給予保障，使安心服務。</p>
<p>第二，公務人員中，造成爲市政服務的優良空氣。希望公務人員從今以後，服務布政，視同經營個人事業，積極努力。曾國藩說：「風俗奚恃乎？自乎一二人之心之所　而已。」這種風氣的造成，應該自上而下，各局長官如能以身作則，則科長階級的幹部人員抱具一致信念，於是風氣蔚成。有了這樣的風氣，我們認爲不難使政治步上軌追。其次，各機關的冗員太多，已爲不可否認的事實，所謂冗員，不是不會做事，就是無事可做，濫竽充數，非但不能帮助工作進行，抑且妨碍工作進行。希望盡量甄別裁汰，同時，節移經費，提高一般幹員的待遇。</p>
<p>第三，就一般事理而言，有能力的人不致賦閒無事，而到處鑽營者恒爲缺乏能力的。所以，爲期適人適事，應隨時物色，不能只徇人情而於推荐中隨便錄用。我們前曾建議，本市見有歷史辦有成績的機稱團體中，很多眞會做事的人才，應委託調査物色，商借調用，澈底實行用人唯才主義。</p>
<h3>皖省民衆　公宴羅省長</h3>

<h3>漢鹽政局長　舞弊案續審</h3>
<p>南京三日中央社電　關於武漢鹽政局長李炎漢等舞弊一案，所有案犯聞經解京以來，迭經特別法庭開庭審訊，由推事錢森。嚴啓明繼續提詢李犯等，歷一小時餘始畢。</p>
<h3>泰首相廣播</h3>
<p>盤谷三日中央社電　泰首相阿巴溫，三日七時二十分，特作新春交換廣播，其大意如次：際此新年，國民內心必相繫於戰爭一點，蓋欲完遂戰爭目的，必須集結國民總力也。念及大東亞戰爭勃發以來，日軍收獲之赫赫戰果時，確信日本國民各位之必勝信念，更必一新。吾人素與日本國民保有緊密友好關係，今復與日本成爲同盟國，深深了解日本爲大東亞各國家各民族之自由及興隆而奮戰之崇高理想，泰國朝野本同盟條約，決盡最大協力。本日常此佳日，吾等泰國國民，謹以衷心祈祝日本勝利，於茲本人以泰國國民之地位，衷心祈念日軍之勝利，日本帝國之愈益隆盛。</p>
<h3>德大使館武官　講述歐戰近況　勝利信念堅定不移</h3>
<p>南京三日中央社電　德國駐華大使韋爾曼，三日下午五時在寗海路五號官邸茶會，招待首都新聞記者，到國府外交部歐美司長范拂公。宣傳部指導司幫辦黎節。軍事委員會總務廳軍令司第五科長李卓生。第六科長桂誥。日大使館情報部長岸偉一。暨中日德各通訊社報社記者等四十餘人。席間首由韋爾曼大使致歡迎詞，繼由武官賴和德少校演講歐戰近况，對近日德國在西綫反攻情形，詳爲報道。詞畢韋爾曼大使對中日兩國報通機關及新聞界同情德國協力作戰之盛情，深致謝忱，並力言德國對於戰爭之最後勝利，已具有堅同不可動搖之信心，迄六時餘始在熱烈情緒中散會。</p>
<p>茲將賴武官之演詞錄後：自大使上次十一月十日招待新聞記者，距今將滿八個星期，上次本人曾經談過，在德國方面須有一種獲得寬裕時間的戰爭，使德國全民總動員中的人事與器材之佈置能以貫澈施行，因獲得時間的戰爭而進人到一種新的狀况。惟在全民總動員之部署尙未達到完成，尤其是新兵器的製造需要用多時間與工作，才能發揮其威力。敵人優勢物質的時候，一個轉捩點已經達到了，就是德國的軍事更能由守勢轉取攻勢，而其在攻勢戰爭中活動。當十二月十六日德軍用強大兵力開始進攻爲驚慌，而德軍在各方面及後方都極爲興奮，就是我們的同盟民族也極爲歡欣。西戰塲狀况德軍在堅苦抗戰中，敵軍終於漸漸進逼，且將進到德國邊境，有幾處甚至到了德國的彊土，雖然算是進展，但沒有得到決戰的效果。（未完）</p>

<p>瑞典京城三日中央社電　德國社訊：莫斯科電台評論敎皇庇護斯十二世之聖誕致辭，謂敎皇之詞，已顯明敎廷之政策乃在偏袒德國使逃避其行爲之責任，敎皇之辭無一語譴責國社主義及法西斯主義，反而苛責要求眞正民主之廣大羣衆。</p>

<p>讀者助學消息</p>
<h3>讀者來函建議　請各行莊認捐一隊　迅速勸募完成使命</h3>
<p>昨天本報接得某錢莊職員雷君的來信，照錄如下：「鄙人係錢業從業員，本學期子女會受貴處之助學金，無任惑戴。目前因生活略覺寬舒，故自下學期起，不擬再行申請，惟本人尙無助人之能力耳！近見貴報有特別勸募隊之發起，法良意善，在此幣値低落之今日，區區二萬元一隊，實屬輕而易舉。查我銀錢業，大小不下五六百家，如果每家能成立一隊，總數亦有一千餘萬元之巨。各銀錢業經理，雖不乏明達之士，但多數是學徒市儈出身，自私自利之心太重，往往做了一二年經理，家中奴僕如雲，手上鑽戒晶亮，但對於同事生活，尙且不顧，要他們顧慮到社會上失學靑年，實難乎其難。故鄙意如要向他們勸募，應先向銀錢業先進呼繃，由公會分函勸導，如果各行莊置諸不理，然後再由貴報分函催募，曉以大義，於助學前途，不無裨益，是否可行，應請尊裁。」</p>
<p>我們讀了雷君的信，便發生幾點意見：（一）雷君的子女，上學期也曾請得助金，最近因家庭經濟好轉，自願放槳，這種精神，非常可佩！希望若干受助學生的家長，也能有同樣表示。最可惡的，是家境本來可以的人，還要申請助金，佔去眞正淸寒學子的名額；還有以前很窮，而年來家境逐漸好轉，依然不肯放棄助金，這是不道德的行爲，希望各校於推薦時愼重考慮，同學方面可以盡力吿發。（二）雷君說各銀行錢莊至少都可成立一隊，這與我們前幾天的建議相同，可惜響應的行莊並不多，不知是何心理？（三）雷君說爲許多行莊的經理，因出身關係，都拘自私自利見解，的確有此情形。否則他們自己與家人的享受，如此奢侈，何以對社會公益，便如此冷淡？（四）函中所陳勸募方法，言之有理，但本報的宗旨，在乎各人盡各人的心願，所謂「隨緣樂助，」不欲勉强勸捐，深望各界人士，爲社會國家着想，爲自已前程，爲十孫積德着想，自動捐欵，多多愈善善！</p>
<p>申請書限明後領取</p>
<p>本處前曾通知大中小各級學校當局彙集繳還上屆所領登記證，憑誰發給第八屆申請書及學籍證，該項申請書等現已配備齊全，亟盼各大中小學校長派員憑本處所發之收據，於明後兩日（五日六日）到館領取，即請按照上塡姓名及號數，轉發各受助生愼重塡寫，再由校方塡就推薦書，至遲於一月十五日送回本處，以憑辦理。至各生學籍證應令妥爲保存，於核准後親送本處，加蓋印鑑，以昭鄭重。至於各大學可將收據交由受助生團契代表來領。又第八屆申請，暫時限於上屆受助舊生，新生暫緩辦理，希各校學生注意。</p>

Let us sincerely welcome this New Year of the 2605th year of the Era and pray for the prosperity of the Imperial Family and the flourishing of the national destiny. Today's war situation has become critical. In order to defend the Imperial Land, the first priority is whether we can overcome the current difficulties. Therefore, this year is truly one of the most important years in the history of our nation. We must gather the total strength of the entire country, make it sound, and be able to overcome all difficulties and advance towards victory. At present, the duty of our navy is extremely important, and its significance is extremely profound.

<h3>Prospects for the Current Stage of the War (4) - Roundtable Discussion by the Chiefs of the Shanghai Japanese Army, Navy, and Foreign Correspondents' Bureaus</h3>
<p>The Terror of the Kamikaze Attack Squad</p>
<p>Matsudaira: There is also the matter of researching and manufacturing new weapons. Past orders and adjustments of old weapons are being canceled and new ones ordered, which has led to a slight decline in military supply production. However, they haven't said a word about the Kamikaze Special Attack Squad and the Commando Airborne Unit, even though they suffered considerable losses.</p>
<p>Matsushima: Only one foreign military attaché mentioned that the enemy suffered significant damage from the Kamikaze Special Attack Squad of the Army and Navy. Only that, nothing more.</p>
<p>Matsudaira: If they say it, it would be troublesome. If it is reported, it will dampen morale.</p>
<p>Matsushima: Regarding the recent issue of the balance of naval power between Britain and the United States, Britain recently announced that it has launched the world's number one battleship. The reason Britain wants to announce this is to counteract the United States.</p>
<p>Matsushima: However, the enemy has been cornered by our offensive, so they are carrying out guerrilla-style bombings of Japanese military supply production zones or air raids on Shanghai. We Japanese people are naturally aware of the indiscriminate bombing by enemy aircraft. What is the psychology of the people who have been victimized by the indiscriminate bombing in Japan and Shanghai recently? Do you know? According to reports from the press, Shanghai is quite resentful about this. Until now, the people thought that there would be no indiscriminate bombing, but recently bombs were dropped in the refugee areas, so they are very hateful.</p>
<p>Ideyoshi: After the bombing of Shanghai, I heard that the leading figures on the Chinese side were furious. Very angry. It is said that if there is such indiscriminate bombing, they will take counter measures.</p>
<p>Matsudaira: Therefore, we should be aware of the enemy's guerrilla-style air raids. The best defense against this is defensive combat, followed by complete air defense facilities.</p>
<p>Matsushima: In short, we must increase the number of air defense aircraft and find ways to limit the damage area to the location where the bombs fall as much as possible. The evacuation of important facilities and the dispersed storage of materials are necessary. Recently, the enemy's broadcasts regarding the air raids on the 11th and 21st were quite detailed. They were broadcast from Yan'an or Shandong. According to the broadcast, "It is best for Matsushima, the head of the Shanghai Naval Press Department, not to run to high places to watch during air raids." From this, we can see that their intelligence is quite detailed.</p>
<p>Matsudaira: In the past, I heard that enemy personnel infiltrated the Hankou area and launched rockets as signals during air raids. We must be very vigilant about this...</p>
<p>Matsushima: There are many orders. They order the guerrillas to investigate in detail where there are factories, where there are warehouses, where materials are stored, and instruct them to mark them with something.</p>
<p>Matsudaira: Not long ago, there was intelligence that 50 or 60 of these staff members had been sent to the area. In short, in addition to guerrilla warfare, plots and propaganda warfare are also quite active. Now, the Greater East Asia War has entered its fourth year, and the decisive battle phase will reach its final stage this year, won't it?</p>
<p>Matsushima: This year will probably be decisive. The war will continue, but there will be a conclusion.</p>
<p>Ideyoshi: Now let's take a look at the domestic situation in the United States. Yesterday I received a telegram. According to a communication dated November 25th, the US Director of Selective Service stated in his military lecture on the 22nd - I don't know if it was a military lecture or what - that the number of people exempted from military service since the beginning of the war has reached 1.44 million. Also, a July 3rd article in "Life" magazine, titled "The Problem of the Treatment of Veterans Exempted from Military Service," stated that the United States had exempted more than 1.25 million people from military service.</p>
<p>Matsudaira: In Britain, the number of people exempted from military service accounts for one-eighth of the number called up.</p>
<p>Enemy Mobilizes Maximum Military Force</p>
<p>Ideyoshi: The US Director of Selective Service also stated that the total number of military personnel in the United States on October 1st was 11.85 million. This mobilized military force is all able-bodied men. If the US population is calculated at 120 million, the ratio to the total population is 10 to 1, meaning that one in five men has been called up.</p>
<p>Matsudaira: However, the 120 million includes black people.</p>
<p>Ideyoshi: In short, it can be said that the mobilized military force has reached its maximum limit. If we consider the attrition rate of the mobilized military force and the problem of the atmosphere of peace generated by the view of victory in the country, we can easily imagine that the atmosphere in the United States of ending the war as soon as possible is quite strong. Therefore, in this fourth year, they will not hesitate to sacrifice on the mainland or in the Pacific. In short, in this fourth year, the Greater East Asia War will present the appearance of the greatest decisive battle. The current air raids on Japan are just one aspect of this. The bombing of various locations on the continent will certainly become more intense.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>New Municipal Administration and New Personnel</h3>
<p>Since the National Government announced the change of the municipal administrator, the general public has had high expectations. The Executive Yuan meeting the other day also approved the candidates for the heads of the municipal police, finance, economy, public works, and supplies distribution bureaus. This gave the people of Shanghai a refreshing impression.</p>
<p>Standing in the position of the citizens of Shanghai, we naturally have a cooperative attitude toward local officials. Unless the local official cannot fulfill his responsibilities, this cooperative attitude will naturally be affected and turn into a distant attitude. It is said that the bureau chiefs who have been transferred to Shanghai are all individuals with rich administrative experience and relatively disciplined integrity. Therefore, we naturally express our welcome and gratification, and at the same time, we place great expectations on them.</p>
<p>However, our welcome and gratification are not for the new figures, but for their ability to fulfill their responsibilities as local officials. How do they fulfill their responsibilities as local officials? We have repeatedly pointed out the current situation in Shanghai and the urgent issues to be resolved, which are sufficient to provide the various bureau chiefs with reference. After the bureau chiefs take office, they may make some adjustments to the personnel under their jurisdiction for the sake of administrative efficiency. We would like to briefly state our views as follows:</p>
<p>First, in any organization, while the leader is in an important position, the cadre personnel who are responsible for the actual execution of the work are equally important. For example, public officials at the section chief level inherit the leader's policy and instruct subordinates to implement it, while understanding the intentions of superiors and making every effort to promote it, and being familiar with the abilities of subordinates and properly managing them. They are cautious and responsible to superiors and lead by example to subordinates. The speed and slowness, thoroughness and omissions of the implementation of government orders depend entirely on the talents of the section chief level. Therefore, their abilities and integrity are extremely important. We hope that special care is taken in the selection of these cadres. At the same time, incompetent personnel should be eliminated and existing competent personnel should be guaranteed to reassure them so they can serve.</p>
<p>Second, create an excellent atmosphere for public officials to serve the municipality. We hope that public officials will, from now on, regard serving the government as running their own business and work actively. Zeng Guofan said: "What does the customs depend on? It is only in the hearts of one or two people." The creation of this atmosphere should be from top to bottom. If the various bureau chiefs can lead by example, the cadre personnel at the section chief level will have a unified belief, and thus the atmosphere will form. With such an atmosphere, we believe that it is not difficult to bring politics back on track. Secondly, there are too many redundant personnel in various agencies, which is an undeniable fact. These so-called redundant personnel either do not know how to do things or have nothing to do, and just fill the numbers. Not only do they not help the work, but they also hinder it. We hope to identify and eliminate as many of them as possible, and at the same time, save money to improve the treatment of general cadres.</p>
<p>Third, generally speaking, capable people will not be idle and doing nothing, while those who are always seeking advancement are usually lacking in ability. Therefore, in order to ensure that the right person is in the right job, one should always look for them and not just be swayed by emotions and casually hire people who are recommended. We have previously suggested that there are many truly capable talents in the city's well-established and successful organizations and groups. We should entrust them with the task of investigating and searching for them, and solicit them for temporary use, and thoroughly implement the principle of using people based on their talents.</p>
<h3>Anhui Province People Hold Public Banquet for Governor Luo</h3>
<p>Bengbu, 3rd (Central News Agency dispatch) - All sectors of Anhui Province held a public banquet at the Provincial Government Auditorium on the 2nd to show their respect to Governor Luo, who has actively promoted local construction and achieved great achievements since he took office in Anhui Province a year ago, which are deeply praised by all the people of Anhui Province.

<h3>Continued Hearing of the Embezzlement Case of the Director of the Wuhan Salt Administration Bureau</h3>

<h3>Thai Prime Minister Broadcasts</h3>
<p>Bangkok, 3rd (Central News Agency dispatch) - Thai Prime Minister Abhaiwongse made a special New Year's exchange broadcast at 7:20 AM on the 3rd, with the gist as follows: On this New Year, the hearts of the people must be focused on the war. In order to complete the war goal, we must gather the total strength of the people. Thinking of the glorious achievements that the Japanese army has achieved since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, we are confident that the belief in victory of all the Japanese people will be renewed. We have always maintained close and friendly relations with the Japanese people. Now that we have become allies with Japan, we deeply understand Japan's noble ideal of fighting for the freedom and prosperity of all countries and ethnic groups in Greater East Asia. The Thai government and people are determined to provide the greatest cooperation in accordance with the alliance treaty. On this auspicious day, we, the Thai people, sincerely pray for the victory of Japan. In my capacity as a Thai national, I sincerely pray for the victory of the Japanese army and the increasing prosperity of the Japanese Empire.</p>
<h3>German Embassy Military Attaché Discusses the Recent Situation in the European War, and the Belief in Victory Remains Firm</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 3rd (Central News Agency dispatch) - German Ambassador to China Wörmann held a tea party at his residence at No. 5 Ninghai Road at 5:00 PM on the 3rd, inviting journalists from the capital, including Fan Fuliang, Director of the European and American Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government, Li Jie, Assistant to the Guidance Division of the Propaganda Department, Li Zhuosheng, Chief of the Fifth Section of the Military Affairs Department of the General Affairs Office of the Military Affairs Commission, Gui Gao, Chief of the Sixth Section, and Kiichi Kishi, Director of the Intelligence Department of the Japanese Embassy, as well as more than 40 reporters from Chinese, Japanese, and German news agencies and newspapers. Ambassador Wörmann first gave a welcome speech, followed by a speech by Military Attaché Major Laihede on the recent situation in the European War, detailing the recent German counter-offensive on the Western Front. After the speech, Ambassador Wörmann expressed his deep gratitude to the Chinese and Japanese press and news organizations and the media for their sympathy for Germany's efforts in the war and strongly stated that Germany had unshakable confidence in the final victory of the war. The meeting ended in a warm atmosphere after 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>The speech of Military Attaché Lai is recorded as follows: It has been almost eight weeks since the Ambassador last hosted reporters on November 10th. I mentioned last time that Germany needs a war that allows it to gain ample time so that the personnel and equipment arrangements in Germany's total mobilization of the people can be thoroughly implemented, and to enter a new situation through a war that gains time. However, the deployment of total mobilization of the people has not yet been completed, and the manufacture of new weapons especially requires a lot of time and work to unleash their power. The enemy's superior material power has reached a turning point, and Germany's military can move from defensive to offensive and engage in offensive warfare. When the German army launched a strong attack on December 16, it was in a state of panic, and the German army was extremely excited in all aspects and in the rear, and even our allied nations were extremely happy. On the Western Front, the German army fought hard, and the enemy finally gradually approached and even entered the German border in several places. Although this can be considered progress, it did not achieve a decisive effect. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Reader's Scholarship News</p>
<h3>Reader's Letter Suggests Each Industry Should Sponsor a Team - Rapidly Raise Funds to Complete the Mission</h3>
<p>Yesterday, this newspaper received a letter from Mr. Lei, a clerk in a money exchange, which is transcribed below: "I am an employee of the money exchange industry. This semester, my children received scholarships from your organization, for which I am deeply grateful. Currently, because life is slightly more comfortable, I do not intend to apply again starting from the next semester. However, I still do not have the ability to help others! Recently, I saw your newspaper's initiative to launch a special fundraising team, which is a good idea and a good intention. In today's time of low currency value, 20,000 yuan per team is actually easy to raise. Upon investigation, there are no less than five or six hundred large and small banks and money exchanges in our industry. If each company could establish a team, the total would be over 10 million yuan. The managers of various banks and money exchanges, although not lacking in enlightened individuals, are mostly apprentices from the marketplace, with a strong sense of selfishness. Often, after being a manager for one or two years, their homes are filled with servants and their fingers are adorned with sparkling diamond rings, but they do not care about the lives of their colleagues, let alone considering the youth who are out of school in society. Therefore, I believe that if you want to solicit donations from them, you should first appeal to the seniors in the banking industry, and the association should send letters of persuasion. If various banks and money exchanges ignore this, then your newspaper should send letters of urging, explaining the great righteousness. This will be beneficial to the future of scholarships. Please consider whether this is feasible."</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Lei's letter, we have a few opinions: (1) Mr. Lei's children also received scholarships last semester. Recently, due to improved family finances, he voluntarily gave up the scholarships. This spirit is very admirable! We hope that the parents of some scholarship recipients can also express the same. The most hateful thing is that people who can afford it still apply for scholarships, occupying the slots of truly impoverished students. There are also those who were very poor before, but their family finances have gradually improved in recent years, and they still refuse to give up scholarships. This is unethical behavior. We hope that the schools will carefully consider this when making recommendations, and students can do their best to report such cases. (2) Mr. Lei said that each bank and money exchange can at least establish one team, which is the same as our suggestion a few days ago. Unfortunately, not many banks and money exchanges have responded. We wonder what their psychology is? (3) Mr. Lei said that the managers of many banks and money exchanges have selfish views due to their origins, which is indeed the case. Otherwise, why are they so indifferent to social welfare when their own and their families' enjoyment is so extravagant? (4) The fundraising methods mentioned in the letter are reasonable, but the purpose of this newspaper is that each person should do their best to contribute according to their wishes. We want to promote "helping joyfully as conditions allow" and do not want to force donations. We sincerely hope that people from all walks of life will donate willingly, as much as possible, for the sake of society and the country, for their own future, and for the sake of accumulating merit for future generations!</p>
<p>Application Forms Limited for Collection After Tomorrow</p>
<p>This office previously notified the authorities of large, medium, and small schools to collect and return the registration certificates received in the previous session, with which the application forms and student status certificates for the eighth session will be issued. The application forms are now fully equipped, and it is hoped that the principals of large, medium, and small schools will send personnel to collect them from the office based on the receipts issued by this office within the next two days (5th and 6th). Please complete the names and numbers according to the instructions, and then distribute them to the scholarship recipients for careful completion. The schools should then fill out the recommendation letters and return them to this office by January 15th at the latest for processing. As for the student status certificates, they should be properly preserved and sent to this office in person after approval to be stamped with a seal to show seriousness. Universities can have the receipts submitted by representatives of the scholarship student fellowship for collection. Also, applications for the eighth session are temporarily limited to old students who received scholarships in the previous session. New students should postpone the application. Students of each school are requested to pay attention.</p>
<p>Women's Table Tennis Finals to Benefit Scholarships</p>
<p>The Zhengxing Cup First Shanghai Women's Individual Table Tennis Championship, organized by Zhengxing Women's Middle School, has been scheduled for the finals at 2:00 PM on the 7th of this month at the Lu Army Dormitory sports hall on Jing'an Temple Road. The team table tennis champion Lianyi (He Ren) has also been invited to compete against the Shanghai United Team to increase the interest of the guests. According to Mr. Chen Linsheng, the chairman of the cup competition, the finals will feature a unique event in which He Ren (Lianyi) will compete against the Shanghai United Team for the first time since the incident. The program is exciting and rare, and it will surely be a sensation in the city. In response to the scholarship campaign of the Shenbao and Xinbao newspapers, and to limit the number of attendees, the organizing committee will present one downstairs admission ticket to those who donate 200 yuan to the scholarship fund of the Shenbao and Xinbao newspapers, and one upstairs admission ticket to those who donate 100 yuan. Each type of admission ticket is limited to 500. (Donations can be made at the school at 162 Luoyang Road from today, and admission tickets will be presented on the spot.) The school's colleagues are public-spirited and enthusiastic about scholarships, for which I express my admiration. The admission tickets have been stamped by both the Shenbao and Xinbao newspapers to show seriousness.</p>

<h3>Group A Football Match Yesterday - Donghua Defeats Huatong - 4 to 0, a One-Sided Affair</h3>
<p>The Group A football match between Donghua and Huatong was held at Jiaozhou Park at 3:00 PM yesterday. Donghua easily defeated Huatong 4 to 0. Dai Linjing did not appear, and the newcomer Lin Dianyi took his place and performed well. The Huatong forwards were like scattered troops, each attacking on their own. The defense line still had something to be desired. A powerful shot hit the crossbar and went out. Donghua attacked again, and Han Longmei circled around and approached the enemy's formation. Chen Xiaoping turned danger into safety. Donghua launched another attack. Feng Shoupeng pushed someone in a hurry, and a penalty kick was awarded. Sun Jinshun missed. Donghua persevered, and Jia Youliang passed to Sun Jinshun. Sun pulled his leg and shot fiercely. Qin Bigao was caught off guard, and the ball went into the net. Huatong conceded a goal in the first half. After the break, the Huatong players were exhausted after a long battle, while Donghua was full of energy. Within two minutes, Han Longhai calmly scored. Not long after, Jia Youliang passed skillfully to Lin Dianyi. Lian Xiaoping could not return to defend in time, and Lin scored from the right corner. In the 30th minute, Tan Fujun intercepted the ball and shot from 20 yards away. The ball bounced off the crossbar, and Han Longhai jumped up and headed it in. As a result, Donghua defeated Huatong 4 to 0.</p>
