<h3>冲繩島南部戰事激烈　日守軍果敢反擊　登陸以來殺傷敵兵逾六萬</h3>
<p>東京四日中央社電　冲繩本島美軍延長兵力，僅十公里餘之戰綫，幷列有八師之兵力，一師團之攻擊正面未滿二公里，敵以如是雄厚之兵力，對日防禦陣地繼續執抝攻擊，結果不顧日守備隊全軍特攻果敢之反擊戰，逐次滲透日軍陣地綫內。本易南部戰綫之局勢，刻復一刻增加其苛烈性，五月三十日由那覇。首里侵入與那原南方三公里稻伏之綫之敵，其後至六月一日，其攻擊重點由東海岸方面集結於那　。首里，而移向中央方面，於海上艦砲射擊之掩護下，以那覇。首里爲中心，企囫突破日複廓陣地，繼絞展開强烈攻勢，　日軍果敢猛烈反擊之間隙，一步一步侵入日軍陣地。六月一日對峙綫爲由那制。首里之南力至稻伏之弧形綫，敵登陸以來，日守備部隊由陸海空三方面對敵之攻擊，勇戰激鬥，殺傷敵兵六萬以上，令敵膽寒，日方損耗，亦日益增加，但於首里，那覇南方縱深陣地日軍大出血戰，强烈發揮其戰果。</p>
<h3>日陸軍省昨發表　山本少尉授獎狀　鹿兒島宮古島等地空襲</h3>
<p>東京四日中央社電　日陸軍省六月四日發表，邀搫來襲北九州之B29型敵機，敢行拼撞攻擊，連身帶機粉碎其一架之陸軍少尉山本三男三郎，曩會授與獎狀，茲奏呈天皇</p>
<p>福岡四日中央社電　南西羣島方面敵艦載機約一百八十架，四日上午三時起至九時止，由鹿兒島港　附近及志布志附近侵入，反復轟炸鹿兒島縣及宮崎縣南部地區日方航空基地。</p>
<p>南西各烏基地四旦中央社電臼航空部隊，二日夜覆猛攻冲繩附近之敵艦船，予以甚大之損害。又三日對琉球列島綫來襲之敵機約二百架，其中以對宮古島來襲之敵機爲最多，約八十架。</p>
<h3>美第三艦隊駛返太平洋</h3>
<p>里斯本四日中央社電　據關島來電，尼米資司令部二日發表如次：哈爾賽麾下之第三艦隊，已駛返太平洋戰塲，同時過去六閱月間從事太平洋作戰之第五艦隊司令官斯浦爾　斯，空母機動部隊司令官米茲卡及水陸兩用部嫩司令官塔那三提督，因需暫時休養歸返本國，米茲卡之任務業由馬根中將担任，塔那之任務業由希爾中將代行。據消息靈通方面推測，此次調動將使太平洋戰爭進入新階段，又斯浦爾恩斯之休養，傳爲準備對中國或日本本土之新作戰。</p>
<p>瑞典京城四日中央社電莫斯科電台二日廣播，暴露美在太平洋有領土野心之論文，該論文出自蘇聯消息報舊金山防員手筆，略謂，美國各報雜藝以及政治指導者，均主張美國應佔領太平洋島嶼，僉認此外別無解漢太平洋問題之途徑。</p>
<h3>希臘艦隊參戰</h3>
<p>里斯本四日中央社電　據雅典電稱：希臘政　二日聲明，希臘因自同盟國對日本亦發生戰爭狀態，故現在希臘艦隊亦多已參加對日作戰。</p>
<h3>婆羅洲山打根　遭艦砲射擊</h3>
<p>西南太平洋基地四日中央社電　敵對婆羅洲烏山打根方面之攻擊，自五月下旬以來，漸呈活潑，三十日以驅逐艦二艘侵入山打根灣內，以艦砲射擊、日守備部隊對之勇猛反擊，而使之遁走。</p>
<h3>日滿紅會　締結公約</h3>
<p>東京四日中央社電　日本紅十字會與滿洲國紅十字會之間，於昭和十三年互相締結協定，叛以强化擴充戰時聯合救隨力，現隨時局之推移，爲期更加澈底起見，四日於新京由日本，滿洲兩紅十字會兩代表之間，互締結關於設施之轉讓等公約。</p>
<h3>鄂葉省長接收　軍政各機關</h3>
<p>漢口四日中央社電　葉蓬氏自長鄂後，關於省政府，綏靖主任公署曁省保安司令部等各機關，尚未正式接收，茲特組織省府，綏署，保安司令部接收委員會，四日下午三時，在五花實館召開首次會議，決定分綏署，保安司令部，建，教，警，淸鄉等組，各組長，組員人選亦經決定，並令分別接收。</p>
<h3>無湖新縣長　魏曙東視事</h3>
<p>無湖四日中央社電　新任無湖縣長兼皖六區專署主任秘書魏曙東，四日晨十時正式接　視事，並舉行新舊任交替　式。</p>
<h3>過去三年五月間美軍死傷逾百萬</h3>
<p>里斯本四日中央社電　據一日舊金山廣　，在過去三年五個月間，美軍死傷已逾一百萬人，內計陸軍八九〇·〇一九人，海軍一一二·八六八人，合計一·〇〇二·八八七人，並說明此數字與上週比較，增加六七九八人。按美國素以人力資源損耗爲戰鬥力之最大弱點，自參戰以來，美團對死傷數字經自行折算後再予發表，據日方有根據之計算，美軍死傷突破百萬之數，已爲今年一月間事，而美方至今日始發表稱死傷哭破百萬，此因美國力謀掩飾人力損耗以及受傷者數字，僅根據送回本國或後方基地之人數而計算之故，但上週起死傷增加六七九八人之一點，殊有重視價值。蓋上週歐洲戰事已吿結束，故死傷人數當完全係在太平洋戰區發生者，僅太平洋一處，在一照美方經過折扣後之數字計算，已値重視。</p>
<p>特魯曼總統木月一日對國會送達咨文，說明自三月十五日至五月二十九日間，在冲繩島方面美陸海軍已死傷三萬七千九百二十五人，即以此數字言，已爲世界戰史上所罕見者，美國人力資源局畏麥克納德亦會指稱：「戰爭之結束將長時期展延」，某海軍觀察家稱：「冲繩日特攻機之成功，對於太平洋艦隊司令部言，猶如一九四二年之德潛艇攻勢」。又第五艦隊司令官史浦爾恩斯曾稱，美海軍在冲繩作戰中遭空前損失。</p>
<p>特魯曼總統又曾宣稱：美國在一年以內將兵力增加一倍，計共七百萬人云，此亦欺人之談，蓋七百萬之大軍決不能調往前綫，且無能容納七百萬人之基地。想其大部份係四散於夏威夷，新幾內亞等太平洋各地，直接戰鬥員恐不及幾分之一，然則特魯曼爲何如此誇大宣傳，恐係公布死傷逾百萬人消息前之緩和劑。且即使有七百萬兵力駐於太平洋，亦並非決定戰局之重要原素，此因美國戰鬥能力如喪失二百萬人時，則美國必將陷入不可救之危境。今日戰局已益形危急，在冲繩作戰中，美海軍巳遭受空前慘重損失，如再企圖向日本本土推進基地，則需較現在更强力之火器陣地以及大兵力，但從使日特攻隊活躍更爲自由，美軍死傷必將日見增加。此次美方發表死傷逾百萬人，吾人再參照目前太平洋戰局，可以想見美國之戰鬥能力不久將越過最高峯而趨向下游矣。</p>
<p>陳　君在粵施米濟貧老</p>
<p>廣州四日中央社電　二日爲陳中委　君衛太夫人首七之期，陳巾委特假靑年館對七十歲以上而屬貧寒者公開施米，以本「老吾老以及人之老」之慈悲心願，並爲衛太夫人作福。是日陳中委親蒞施米地點，指導派發，對塲人數達一千六百七十餘人，施放情形，異常良好</p>
<h3>石渡任日宮相　昨行親任式　松平恒雄氏職照准</h3>
<p>東京四日中央社電　日宮內省發表，宮內大臣松平恒雄辭職照准，這缺由石渡莊太郎繼任，於四日下午三時四十五分舉行親任式。</p>
<h3>前田氏被任　日海運局長</h3>
<p>東京四日中央社電　日運　省一日任命前田克巴，為日本海運事務局局長。</p>
<h3>舊金山會議　延期閉會　蘇代表突被召回</h3>
<p>華盛頓四日中央社電　舊金山會議本擬六月六日閉會，然因故延期。白宮當局三日就此事發表謂，該會處事務局已將此事通告特魯曼總統。</p>
<p>里斯本四日中央社電　據舊金山消息：蘇政府於昨日突將在舊金山之主要代表蘇勃里夫召回，致使大會人員均感　異。將渠召回之訓令，曾與莫斯科之拒絕演解在雅爾達會議中五大國所共同讓訂規條之答覆書，同時抵達舊金山。而蘇勃里夫曾為五大國中之蘇聯代表，故有人深信渠之突然召回，或與此事有關。</p>
<h3>各地收工作　全面推進中</h3>
<p>絲綢業同業聯合會，爲統一管理收繭事宜，業已成立收買　　總管理處於上海。又於杭州·嘉興·蘇州·無錫等四大產地分別成立管理處，以費各收買廠商隨時之接洽聯絡。杭州方面係於五月廿五日開秤，每担鮮　約十八萬元左右。嘉興方面，係於五月三十日開秤，侮担鮮繭約十八萬元左右。蘇州方面係於六月二日開秤，每担鮮繭約廿萬元左右。無錫方面係六月四日開秤，每担鮮繭約廿萬元左右。聞今年春繭產量甚　，滿足該聯合會收買春繭預定之目際可無問題。</p>
<h3>艾登外相　患病休養</h3>
<p>瑞典京城四日中央社電　據倫敦電訊：英曾相邱吉爾於目前須兼領外部各項事務，藍外相艾登正患十二指腸潰爛之重症。然據一般人傳稱，艾登症狀尚無危險，醫生　彼至少須有二星期之休養。</p>
<h3>阿根廷　情勢不穩</h3>
<p>里斯本四日中央社電　據華盛頓電：阿根廷國內情勢，過去頗有惡化之勢，因布宜諾斯艾利斯並無確報，眞相及其原因目下仍不明　。據華盛頓外交權威方面三日聲稱，阿根廷國內情勢，有次第惡化之勢，尤以對報紙及言論之取締甚為嚴重。又二日特魯曼會見記者謂，阿根廷情勢　為遺憾。</p>
<h3>民食問題與社會心理</h3>
<p>昨天大陸新報社評，題爲「顛倒銷亂的社　心理」，論列近來米價物價暴漲的原因，由於社會心理顛倒錯亂的作用，這種心理的形成，半由於認識不足，半由於經濟施策的失敗。因此，枓正此種心理，非先考慮經濟施策改進不可。</p>
<p>我們對於大陸新報的論點，認爲在問題的觀察上，相富正確和深入。不過，社會心理　倒　亂的形成，其原因還須補充數點：</p>
<p>第一，民衆對於生活，隨時具有杌隍不安的心理，因爲巳經當局規定的配給物品，而不　得到實際配給。生活必需品物價，隨時高漲，漫無止境，因此，將來對於生活必需品，能否獲得，心理上絕無把握。</p>
<p>第二，一般暴利主義者，只圖個人發財，就只知囤積投機。對於糧盒，也爲若輩追求暴利的目標，遇機囤種，操縱居奇。例如這次米價飛漲，雖不應漲至如此　度，但尚有一部份原因，而一般雜糧根本無米價高漲之原因，亦隨之此例高漲，則有大力者在背後囤積操縱無疑。同時，一般比較有錢者，爭相購儲，超過短期需要數量，抱着但須我能解決，雖再高漲與我並無影響的熊度。</p>
<p>第三，一般心理，認爲中國主管當局對於經濟統制，尤其糧食統制，似乎已届東手無策的地步，似乎缺乏勇氣與盟邦當局作坦自澈底的商討，以期獲得解決辦法，打開難關。</p>
<p>第四，同時，一般心理，認爲日本主官當局，雖極顧到中國民生問題，可是，對於民生實際的困難，尤其是目前的糧食問題，急迫與嚴重的程度，還沒有　解眞象，更沒有預想到危機。</p>
<p>這次米糧一再狂漲，連續一週有餘，而迄至今日。仍沒有比較切實的對策與救急的辦法，在這樣的悄勢下，又如何使社會民衆心理不發生顛倒錯亂呢？</p>
<p>然而，我們對於民食救急對策，已在本月二日的社評中提出建議。這襲，値得重複提出的，例如：</p>
<p>建議當局從速向盟邦軍部偕米配給，這是最切實有效的對策，究竟當局曾否接洽商借？盟邦當局是否答允商借？在我們民間的觀測，對於這一建議，成就與否，似乎在三四日內立可得到解決的。</p>
<p>建議當局向淮海省採辦雜糧，運滬配給，這又是毫無遲疑而應做的事，究覺當局有否接治？接洽到若何程度？當局接洽深是民間接洽的？</p>
<p>建議嚴禁雜糧抬價，因為米價暴漲尚有原因，而雜糧比例暴漲，除了乘機暴利以外，別無原因，當局有否抑制辦法？合理收買，以之配給，爲什麼不立即實行？</p>
<p>米糧統制經構，米糧收買方式，在過去經騐中是否合理？中日當局曾否共同檢討過？如果以爲合理的，則米糧價格爲什麼如此瘋狂暴漲？如果中日當局見到收買方式並不合理，則爲了軍需民食的雙方利益，中日雙方當局爲什麼不坦自討論改善辦法？如果中國當局已經見到而不加提出，抱着任他去的態度，則是中國當局的失職。同時，希望盟邦當局必須認淸中國人民的民食問題，巳經達到最嚴重的稷度，應該深究其原因所在，應該反省過去對於收買方式的未適合理？我們深信盟軍在軍事上取得勝利是有把握的，一切準備是周密妥善的，可是，曾否恕到如果中國國民經濟一旦崩潰，則在軍事上將受到什麼程度的妨礙。這是不能不鄭重三思的。而目前的民食問題的嚴重性，就是國民經濟的危機，絕對不應輕視。</p>
<p>我們更堅決地深信，只要中國當局的力量，盟邦駐華當局的力量，民間領導的力量，一致凝給，則一切難關，都能克服。在這一個信念下，民盒問題，自然也可以得到迅速解決的。可是，這三種力量，目前彼此脫了節，因此，形成了社會心理顛倒錯亂的現象，一切迫切的實際問題，都不能得到迅速的解決。</p>
<h3>顛倒錯亂的社會心理</h3>
<p>米價　續昻騰，各種物價繼之狂漲，此爲周知的事實。靜觀其狀况，我們所最先感到者，即物價與民衆心理的息息相關。</p>
<p>使米價　贵的原因，一半在於民衆心理作用。米糧來源的梗塞，以及關係收買前途悲觀的預測，固可促使現實的米價狂漲。然觀察其他各種物價，情形可說亦復相同。而此種悲觀的預測未必妥當，則凡爲明悉現實情形者，均能瞭解。民衆因驚於自構的幻影，還致苦了自己的生活；而我們則於此發見了可悲的社會心理之顛倒錯亂。</p>
<p>冷靜觀察，糧食及各種物資，未必如此窘迫。現有物資固然未必豐裕，然由方法如何，滿足上海南京等的民需，亦未必困難。以為今日若不迅即搜購預貯，則將來必難買到，這種思想，顯然是民衆的錯覺。而民衆自身則因此種錯覺而陷於困苦中，這實在是太可笑的現象。奸商與投機分子捉住這種機運，利用民衆心理，由此而貧圖不正當的利益，誠屬可惡，而民衆自己的苦於此種心理，則更是可憐的現象。</p>
<p>爲解決現實的物價與米糧問題起見，此種顛倒錯亂的社會心理，自非糾正不可。然而此種心理並非一朝一夕所成，而由一定的經濟條件產生，此點必須先行認識。無論敵方的謀略宣傳如何利害，若無傍證的事實，其效果即很微小。若視現實社會心理的變熊與此種宣傳有關，則也須反省或已給予敵方宣傳可乘之際。從而，無論如何，對於經濟條件總得加以根本的檢討，尤其對於蒐買配給機構等的全面改造問題，更應提出來討論。</p>
<p>對於表現於今日物價問題上的中國社會心理，我們有深加攷察的必要。顛倒錯亂的心理，一半固出於誤解及認識不是與敵方的謀略宣傳等，一半亦因各種經濟施策的失敗，致令這種　的　鎭亂為不可避免的事實。我們必須率直承認這個事實，而推　經濟的再建工作。若果的。爲改革社會心理起見，必先消除成爲社會心理原因的經濟上社會上的條件。而我們現在僅、於看見民衆的心理而徒然大聲疾呼罷了。欲糾正此種　倒錯亂的心理，非深切攷處經濟施策的眞正改進不可。（六月三日大陸新報社論）</p>
<h3>蘇北觀感</h3>
<p>— 黃</p>
<p>記者此次前赴蘇北，爲時約一月有飲，所至縣區，計有束台，　縣，江都三縣，及安監，　　兩鎭。其他尚有鑒，雄，通，如，海，靖等地，均以時間匆促未克前往，一　蘇北全豹。茲篇所言，僅就此番旅行所及，絡抒觀感，以瓣讀者。</p>
<p>蘇北人民，目前最感苦痛者，莫禍於苛捐雜稅之積征暴飲，負担重重。路以東台縣而論，去年秋間經某駐軍之大規模「請財神」的結果，城區稍具資產者、均走避一空，縣屬安　鎭情形更屬慘惡，雖肩挑貿易，小本經營者均一網打盡。當時全鎭三十三保住民中，僅有六旬老者二人留鎭一姓錢，一姓周，一病，一　，始邀倖免，家家閉戶關門，欲購燒餅油條亦不可得。該區區長亦趁駐軍移防挾款潛逃，區政無人負責者達兩月之久。記者此次在該鎭與住民接談，無不談虎色變，人人切齒。直至去年廢曆年關，居民始絡繹自鄰近縣區返家，輕此浩刼，當局應如何體恤人民，俾資修養生息？洒自今年三四月來，該縣人民負担日益加重，大有訴告無門之苦—曾記者留駐該縣時，正値舉辦措借軍稻兩萬石，乃此項尚未辦齊，而籌借軍糧（合大米小麥兩項而言）雨萬石之令復下，前者係按保甲制度分區分鎭按戶按畝瓣派，後者係指定殷實富戶及大商店動購糧券認撒，計分大戶七十石，中戶五十石，小戶三十石，其中小麥佔十之七，米佔十之三。</p>
<p>由東台縣府派法警分送通知書，限三日內守提，第一批被通知者計八十戶，第二批被通知者計九十六戶，此僅就城區而言，其他鄉鎭尚不在內。在上者發一命令，侮感易易，不知在下者，即利用此而得一中飽之機會，而該縣糧價經此鉬額搜購之刺戟，遂掀起絕大漲風，人民愁罟怨嗟，繞室徬徨。</p>
<p>軍紀不振</p>
<p>蘇北各縣駐軍，大都採防區制度，表而上似有統率，實際上則各自為政。每縣駐防軍隊，多則一師，少則一旅，即一鄉鎭之防守兵和，亦往往在一營一圑以上，再益以各縣原有之保安隊，其實力自可稱為雄厚。惟以防區有肥擠，駐軍有優劣，故往往各地情形不同，決不能以此例彼，加以部隊長官對士兵之管理及待遇方式之不同，所表現之軍風紀的好壞，亦不可一概而論。大抵某一地區之士兵官佐獨身者多，拖家帶眷者少，則其本身負擔開支較輕，對地方之苛　需求即較好，反之，某一地區之士兵官佐拖家帶眷者多，其本身所得之薪餉決不足以應付其支出，則對地方之苛　需求，自所難免，如強住民房，　用傢俱，收取捐費，就地籌餉。平心而論，以今日生活程度之高漲，每一士兵之薪餉，決不足以維持其個人生活，難有賢長官亦無法制止其軌外行動。良懦人民，但求荷安撫事，何敢到處控訴與駐軍為敵？再如記者於五月十三日由泰縣赴揚州途中，於清晟乘木炭小汽車出發，行約十八里抵界溝，突遇駐軍『封軍』—即征發車輛作軍用之意。士兵荷槍由一連長指揮強迫乘軍者一一下車，頃刻之間，封有五輛之多，被迫下車者有五十人之衆，旅客前既進不能，後退又不可，手握已付出車餐之車票，向　連長要求骰法，而渠祗輕輕答以『沒有法子』一語，即揮諸駕駛車夫開車他去，有不解者，即如軍事征用車輛，泰縣可『封』，揚州可『封』，然偏不『封』，獨於中途攔截而謂之『封車』，陷人於已付車費而無特許之環境。</p>
<p>求治殷切</p>
<p>總之，蘇北各縣人民久處於水深火熱之中，自綏靖主任孫良誠將軍駐節揚州以來，各方面均寄予熱烈之期待，然以蘇北環境之複雜，民生凋敝之解除，決非短時期內所能生效，所幸『飢者易為食，遇者易為飲，』人民於大病之餘，果能得一適當調洽及注意平齋營養，則康復亦非難事。簡言之，即今日之穌北，倘能先從減輕人民負担，整飭軍隊風紀入手，言必行，行必果，則三個月後的蘇北，必然險霾一掃，花明四射，可預卜也。</p>
<h3>棉花增產協議會　趕辦結束</h3>
<p>棉花增產協總會，已於五月底以前正式解散，所有東拓及口北綜合研究所，江口鹽墾地區棉花增產協議會，亦即宣告同時解散，一面並成立該協議會整理委員會，積極着手進行整理工作。凡有該協議會已了未了事宜，及其尙　之大量資金·最後返還手續，均將該　理會負責辦理清楚，以查結束。丹麥重視自由</p>
<h3>丹麥重視自由反對變更過界</h3>
<p>瑞典京城四日中央社電　據社約時報特派訪一員談稱：關於丹麥兩部之國境界，曾於哥本哈根一再討論，而大衆　察丹麥當局目前實不欲有重行勘定邊境綫。對此，在德國曾發表謂，「若欲變更邊界以削弱我國地位，使我國境界退縮至南部，則此項舉動必將對我丹麥國民素來重視之自由正義觀念相互抵觸。我國現定之國境界，實有　於國民之自主與合作精神，同時我丹麥之國家與社會，即建築於此國民之目主與合作精神上」。</p>
<h3>京蘇錫杭發行　中儲金證券　分爲一兩與五兩二種</h3>
<p>中央社訊　中央儲備銀行爲收縮通貨，穩定金融，引導游資轉移正當投資途經起見，特　準發行金證券，自五月七日起，於滬市發行首期金證券　買者極爲踴躍。故於五月二十一日起，　發二期金證券，六月四日起至六日止繼續　第三期，其首期金證券並定本月七日起至九日止，憑券兌付黃金。茲悉該行爲推廣金證券發行，以應　中各大都市金融界商民需要，定五·六兩日·在南京·蘇州·無錫·杭州等四地，發行一兩·五兩二種金證券，價格與上海相同，每兩一百二十五萬元，由該行各地分支行發行。</p>
<h3>民衆訓練部　月中可成立</h3>
<p>南京四日中央社電　中央黨部中央執行委員會爲加強民訓事宜，決成立民衆訓練部，並任　思平爲部長。茲悉：該部現正積極籌備，約於本月中旬即可正式成立，地址已勘定在巾央黨部內前商務局原址。</p>
<h3>印報警告英法　不得傷害聖師</h3>
<p>里斯本四日中央社電　據新德里昨夜發表消息：全印回教聯盟會主席舉那所主辦之「　光　」，昨日發表論文，警告英法兩團不准傷害耶路撒冷之　敎法典大教師　西尼。按赫氏會於德國南部遭法軍所捕，目前拘禁於巴黎。上週突有消息傳出，赫氏將被移解至英國，該「曉光報」述稱，英政府必須了解殉道者之血價值重大，彼等若有意保護此聖師，彼等宜趕速將赫西尼從法國政府之堂中爲放出來，英國若對赫氏有所不利，則可謂對整個回教世界之破壞。</p>
<h3>行莊外埠匯款　較前減低</h3>
<p>滬市銀錢業自上月實施緊編外埠各地　款，市面流通　　已較前靈活。同業各行莊之圈劃業務，平均較過去兩月約減低百分之七十以上。又悉該業對於實停通　之地點，如金融情况好轉，決予適當之調　。</p>
<h3>法表明決意　維護敘黎權益　對兩國獨立不予承認</h3>
<p>蘇黎世四日中央社電　巴黎電：法政府主席特戈爾，二日對記者暴露英國挑撥叙利亞糾紛之陰謀，並表明法政府有以武力擁種叙利亞及黎巴嫩機益之決意如次：敘利亞及黎巴嫩紛爭之動機，可說由於英國直接挑撥，因駐該兩國之多數英國機關會煽動住民反法，而特英國武器之叙利亞警察隊，屢次襲擊法軍前哨。又英國駐敘利亞及黎巴嫩之軍隊，總計達六十餘萬，而法軍則僅駐有五千左右之少數部隊，其餘皆撤至西部之沙漠地帶，法政府業於五月三十日命令法軍停止戰鬥。余接到英首相之備忘錄係於三十一日，然該備忘錄並未能使法政府變更態度，將來恐亦不能變更態度，余因其利害關係，遂未作回答。就法政府目前之問題而言，則埃及·伊拉克·巴力斯坦等國，無論由政治或由地理各面觀察，偕須以獨立國家資格而存在，法政府對敘亞黎巴嫩兩國於獨立上必要之條件，吾等唯一要求，則欲期與英美兩國同樣爲解決本國文化經濟利書計，以締結各項條約。法代表於五月八日會對敘利亞黎巴嫩　議此項交涉，但爲該兩國　紀，其後未久，法軍即爲敘利亞武裝暴徒團所襲擊。法政府關於此次紛爭，認爲須以國際協力解決，不可採取其他解決方策，法國民當一致以政府爲中心，强力團結，遇必要時，不惜以武力　　法國利益及威嚴。</p>
<p>蘇黎世四日中央社電　巴黎電：決外長二日對記者正式表明法政府對叙黎兩國之態度如次：法政府前曾欲承認叙利亞黎巴嫩兩國之獨立，然現在則全無承認兩國獨立之意。</p>

<p>里斯本四日中央社電　據大馬色消息：於阿刺伯聯盟會議之前夕，敘利亞外長貝伊會發表謂，「法國正極力在敘國境內計劃一陰謀，故從此敘國與法國之關係，不得不予斷絕。」渠復隊特戈爾之聲明加以轉擊稱，「於上月間，吾人曾一再警告法政府，若法國軍隊愈是逞强，大量增兵，則我叙國欲依照英政府之忠告，竭力尋求一妥善方法以排解兩國間之糾粉愈益困難，且麻煩叢生。吾人曾於五月二十日至二十六日蒐集一切憑證，足賽證明法國在叙利亞有野心之企圖，故特戈爾將軍之聲明，僅爲掩飾法國之陰謀而已。最近法國對吾人之舉動，實將叙法兩國間僅存之一點友好關係亦予破裂，　見法國企圖於敘利亞境內獲得一有特殊　利智地位，但今彼已獲得一並不如其意念中之特殊權利地位矣，吾人正準備一切根據正養與平等之方法，以解決此難題，吾人對此次英國之出力　停，實深表盛謝」。同時貝伊外長，復將上週間在大　色所遭損害，作成統計如下：死者四百名，失踪及疑巳死亡者一百名，受傷者五百名。</p>

<p>民衆反法情緒激昂</p>
<p>里斯本四日中央社電　大爲色戰鬥行爲本月一日暫告結束，然叙利亞民衆之反法情緒益趨激烈，二日各地舉行打倒法帝國主義之大示威運動，茲據大馬色路透電稱，叙利亞居民之反動團，二日製擊市內法國哨防本部，殺傷法兵三名，英當局已佈告，大馬色市民自二日下午一時起　止外出。</p>
<p>法國軍民撤離敘境</p>
<p>里斯本四日中央社電　據大馬色報告稱，法國軍隊及其家屬，均於英軍卵翼下退出敘利亞市鎭，彼等於昨日全日忙於　抄小道撤退，以避敘人之示威運動。現法國民衆均已完全撤至黎巴嫩京城貝普特之某特別集中營內</p>
<p>法盼蘇聯出作調人</p>
<p>蘇黎世四日中央社電　巴黎電合廣播稱：關於敘利亞黎巴嫩糾紛問題，一般確信蘇聯必同情於法國，相信蘇聯不僅以公平無私之力塲觀察糾紛，且能力避刺激友好國家，並能進而對當事各國提出既合理且具證之解決辦法。</p>

<h3>四團體昨茶會　歡送松島部長　出席五百餘人情緖歡洽</h3>
<p>日駐華艦隊報道部長松烏大佐，此次奉命榮轉要職，本市工商聯誼會·國民外交促進會·中國新聞協會上海區分會·雜誌聯合會等四團體，時於昨（四）日下午假康樂酒　舉行歡送茶會。松島部長階同松本，平田兩大尉等準時蒞會，由四團體代表聞　亭·袁履登·陳彬龢·魯風等招待。並到市宣傅處長顧處長。靑木節·　本寅治·赤星爲光。尾坂興市·日高淸磨瑳·林康侯·陳紹嬀·趙正平·陳日平·項康原等五百飲人。首由四團體代表主席袁　登致歡送詞，繼由松島部畏致詞答謝，旋由各團體代表陳彬龢，魯風演說，最後松島部長並吟詩一首，情緒備極歡洽。</p>
<p>主席致詞</p>
<p>主席袁履登致詞略謂：「松職，四團體特舉行茶會餞行以示敬意。松島部長蒞任以來，努力報道任務，不但新聞界深爲感謝，即上海各團體亦獲益非淺。希望松島部長榮轉後，仍以上海爲念，繼績予以協助，傳吾人共向完遂大東亞戰爭之途努力邁進。」</p>
<p>部長答詞</p>
<p>松島部公；今日荷承四團體熱烈歡送，萬分感謝。本人自前年八月從靑島蒞任以來，其問　發生重大變化，但所負報道任務，　諸君誠摯協力，皆能逐次完成，並未隕越，尤爲感激。本人至中國，此爲第五次，但以此次最能對中國有所認識，且深切瞭解中國民情，收獲亦屬最大。本人自幼研習漢學，對於中國印象亦深，故本人與中國之關係，絕不能分離。値茲戰時，木人以軍人資格，　責報道工作，尤其對中國之全面和平，希望全力促其實現，今後當一貫初衷，努力邁進，並祈諸君今後再接再勵，爲大東亞建設而努力。」</p>
<p>陳彬龢詞</p>
<p>記得兩年前，民國三十二年九月三日，松島大佐就任艦隊報道部長招待本市記者團時，曾對我們說：「今後更須澈底了解大東亞戰爭之意義，以東洋文化之眞價，擊碎敵軍暴戾之侵略，以求最後的勝利。而吾人負報道責任者，尤應覺悟責任日重，不屈不撓，始終不渝，爲吾人之信條。我希望與諸君以日本海軍之他統精神，活躍報道戰綫，完成重任」。回顧兩年以來，松烏部長的話，可說完全做到了，特別使我們不能忘懐的，是下面兩件事：</p>
<p>第一，帮助與指導我們負報道之責任者，自己團結合作。松島部長對於過去新聞聯合會，曾盡過很大的助力，使該會得以在重大的時局中，履行其本身的任務。其後中國新聞協會成立，上海新聞聯合會改組爲區分會，松島部長更盡力帮助我們新組織的成立。從此以後，中國的新聞報道實業，有了　　的統一的核心組織。</p>
<p>第二，由於近團年來時間的發展，上海的新聞事業，其處境亦日益困難，特別是印刷用紙問題，電力供給問題，新聞報道資材問題，以及新聞報道內容及繼構經營之改善聞題等等，都賴松島部長熱心指導，協助解決，使我們逐漸克服困難。</p>
<p>松島部長所以能完善實現其在中國的抱負，値得我們感佩的，第一是因爲他是一惆名副其實的熱心研究中國問題者，曾先後於民國二十年，二十一年至二十二年，二十六年及二十八年來華，對於我國處境，有深刻的同悄。第二是因爲他本人就是文學作家，是一員儒將，長於　呈，而且接近中國民間，而我們新聞界又是以民之喉舌自任的，所以彼此意志都能如永乳交融。</p>
<p>現在松島部長榮轉回國，我們不免感到精神上一種損失，好在部長此去，還是縱續推行完遂大東亞戰爭的工作，我們今後將繼績在同一目標下奮鬥。今天特比要提出，請部長帶給盟邦朝野，並希望中日輿論界共同努力實現的，便是要以加倍的努力完成中日協力，我們始終認爲中日兩國的親密眞誠的協力，是完遂大東亞戰爭及解決東亞問題的前提。時局愈艱難，我們的信念愈當堅定，我們的努力愈當加强，而中日協力之實踐與完遂，尤當從適合對方國情民情，把持對方民心爲基本方向。敬祝部長身體健康，前途愉快。</p>
<p>李思浩氏賦詩贈別</p>
<p>又中國新聞協會會長李思浩氏爲松島部長榮轉職要，特賦詩贈別，茲錄原詩如次：</p>
<p>綏帶輕裘古將才，樓船績海浪花開，豪情直儗陳驚座，妙論紛紜舌底來。淞濱初見即論詩，　勃肝腸入　　，惜別憂時同悵惘，相期共葆歲寒姿。亦需亦俠亦溫文，却把　詩特贈君，分手河梁一樽酒，離懷時繞海果雲。</p>

<h3>體育　甲組球員限制　參加小球賽</h3>

<h3>集中購雜糧　急救本市米荒辦法</h3>
<p>近日米糧市價又呈激漲，共劇烈程度，超越過去之紀錄，雖中上階級家中多少均有存米，而大部份平民無隔宿之糧者，占其什九，即有存米者，如不源源補充，亦雜支持久長，人心慌惶，不可終日，若不迅行緊急救濟，則不特各業均將瓦解，且將引起治安上之危機。市政諮詢委員會忝爲民意機關，對此寗容坐視，似應即速協助市府，迅　緊急救濟方案，以解市民倒　，茲就管見所及，　陳辦法如左：</p>
<p>據各方調查所得，欲求米糧來源之充沛，短期內恐已無望，故救濟本市米糧恐慌之對策，衹能盡力設法充裕雜糧來源，以應亟需，淮海省等雜糧產地出產豐富，必能充份供給。</p>
<p>上海特別市政府應設立雜糧購配委員會，主持雜糧之購運分配，以專責成，市府秘書長經濟局及社會福利局局長均爲富然委員，另聘米糧統制會主任委員諮詢委員若干人，及市商會理事畏等爲委員。</p>
<p>購　雜糧之種類，由委員會調查後公佈之，購運數量第一批以一百萬萬元爲目標，以後陸續採群，視情勢之演變再行斟酌增減。</p>
<p>本市各業公會得向市商會立約購購雜糧，每單位至少爲四百萬元，其中五成供各工會配給於會員職工之用，五成由委員會微購，公開照本平糶，所得售價，即以價還各認購工會之勢款</p>
<p>各公會認購雜糧，應預付定銀五成，其餘之價款五成，由委員會　請中央儲備銀行先行墊借，以應事機，俟貨對後，各公會付款出貨時償還之。</p>
<p>各未入公會之商號工廠慈善團體及住家等，亦得預先付足價欲，向市商會腮購雜糧，每單位至少二百萬元，但如產地存最或運輸能力不數支配時，應僅先購運各公會之認購額。</p>
<p>以上所舉各項，僅　大綱，此事之奏效，貴在劍及　及，迅訂細則，從速施行，以應事機，否則西江水到，涸鮒已死，尚有何用。更有進者，米荒問題之嚴重，市民人人有切膚之關係，即家有存米一年或數月者，如米價不落，其持續期間亦至短暫，故心理上仍受米貴之威脅。因是市民均應羣策羣力，共同合作，以謀困難之解決，切勿稍存隔岸關火之心，自誤誤人。</p>

<h3>Fierce Fighting in Southern Okinawa; Japanese Defenders Launch Courageous Counterattacks, Inflicting Over 60,000 Enemy Casualties Since Landing</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) – American forces on Okinawa Island, having extended their troop strength, now occupy a battle line of just over ten kilometers, deploying eight divisions. The attack front of a single division is less than two kilometers. With such formidable strength, the enemy continues to launch stubborn attacks against the Japanese defensive positions. In response, the entire Japanese garrison is carrying out courageous special attacks, gradually infiltrating the enemy’s lines. The situation on the southern battlefront is becoming increasingly severe with each passing moment. On May 30th, the enemy, having advanced from Naha and Shuri, breached the Inafuku line, three kilometers south of Yonabaru. Subsequently, by June 1st, the focus of their attacks shifted from the east coast to the Naha-Shuri area, concentrating on the central sector. Under the cover of naval artillery fire, they attempted to break through the Japanese outer perimeter, launching a relentless offensive centered on Naha and Shuri. Amidst the courageous and fierce counterattacks by Japanese forces, the enemy is inching into Japanese positions. As of June 1st, the line of confrontation stretched from the south of Naha-Shuri to the arc of Inafuku. Since the enemy landing, the Japanese garrison has fought bravely and fiercely, launching attacks against the enemy from the land, sea, and air, inflicting over 60,000 casualties, striking fear into the enemy's hearts. Japanese losses are also steadily increasing, but in the deep defensive positions south of Shuri and Naha, Japanese forces are putting up a fierce fight, yielding significant results.</p>

<p>Wuhu, 4th (Central News Agency) – The newly appointed County Magistrate of Wuhu and concurrently Chief Secretary of the Sixth District Commissioner's Office of Anhui Province, Wei Shudong, formally took office at 10:00 AM on the 4th, and a handover ceremony was held.</p>
<h3>Over One Million American Casualties in the Past Three Years and Five Months</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) – According to a San Francisco broadcast on the 1st, American casualties have exceeded one million in the past three years and five months, including 890,019 army personnel and 112,868 navy personnel, totaling 1,002,887. It was also stated that this number is an increase of 6,798 compared to the previous week. America has always regarded the depletion of human resources as its greatest weakness in combat effectiveness. Since entering the war, the United States has re-calculated the casualty figures before releasing them. According to reliable Japanese calculations, American casualties had already exceeded one million by January of this year, but the United States is only now announcing that casualties have exceeded one million. This is because the United States is trying to conceal the depletion of manpower and the number of wounded, calculating only based on the number of people sent back to their home country or rear bases. However, the point that casualties increased by 6,798 in the past week is particularly noteworthy, as the European war has ended. Therefore, the number of casualties must have occurred entirely in the Pacific theater. Even with the American-discounted numbers, the situation in the Pacific is worthy of serious consideration.</p>
<p>President Truman delivered a message to Congress on May 1st, stating that American army and navy casualties in the Okinawa area from March 15th to May 29th totaled 37,925. Even with this figure alone, it is rare in the history of world war. The head of the US Manpower Resources Bureau, Paul V. McNutt, also stated that "the end of the war will be prolonged." One naval observer said, "The success of the Japanese kamikaze attacks in Okinawa is like the German U-boat offensive of 1942 for the Pacific Fleet Command." Also, Admiral Spruance, commander of the Fifth Fleet, stated that the US Navy suffered unprecedented losses in the Okinawa campaign.</p>
<p>President Truman also declared that the United States would double its military strength within one year, totaling seven million men. This is also deceptive talk, as a large army of seven million can never be transferred to the front line, and there is no base capable of accommodating seven million people. Presumably, the majority of them are scattered throughout the Pacific in places like Hawaii and New Guinea, with probably only a fraction being direct combatants. So why is Truman exaggerating his propaganda so much? Perhaps it is a sedative before announcing the news of over one million casualties. Furthermore, even if there are seven million troops stationed in the Pacific, it is not a critical element in determining the outcome of the war. If the United States loses 2 million combat effective personnel, it will be beyond saving. The war situation is becoming increasingly critical today. The U.S. Navy has suffered unprecedented heavy losses in the Okinawa campaign. Further attempts to advance bases toward the Japanese mainland will require more powerful firepower positions and larger forces than at present, but this will only allow Japanese special attack units to be even more active, and American casualties will inevitably increase daily. With this American announcement of over one million casualties, combined with the current Pacific war situation, it is foreseeable that the American combat capability will soon pass its peak and decline.</p>

<h3>Food Problem and Social Psychology</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the *Continental Daily News*'s editorial, titled "Inverted and Disordered Social Psychology," discussed the reasons for the recent surge in rice and commodity prices, attributing it to the effect of inverted and disordered social psychology. The formation of this psychology is half due to a lack of understanding and half due to the failure of economic policies. Therefore, to correct this psychology, it is necessary to first consider improving economic policies.</p>
<p>We believe that the *Continental Daily News*'s viewpoint is quite accurate and insightful in its observation of the issue. However, the formation of an inverted and disordered social psychology needs to be supplemented with several points:</p>
<p>First, the public constantly has a sense of anxiety about life because they are unable to obtain the supplies that have already been allocated by the authorities. The prices of essential commodities rise constantly and without end, so there is no psychological certainty that one will be able to obtain essential commodities in the future.</p>
<p>Second, most profiteers only seek personal wealth and only know how to hoard and speculate. Food has also become a target for those seeking exorbitant profits, who seize opportunities to hoard and manipulate prices. For example, although the soaring rice prices this time should not have risen to such a degree, some of the reason may be attributed to hoarding. However, the prices of ordinary coarse grains have also risen to high level, which is suspected to be due to large-scale hoarding and manipulation by powerful individuals behind the scenes. At the same time, most people with wealth are competing to purchase and store goods, exceeding the amount needed in the short term, with the attitude of "as long as I can solve it, even if prices rise higher, it will not affect me."</p>
<p>Third, the general public believes that the Chinese authorities in charge of economic control, especially food control, seem to have reached a point of helplessness, and seem to lack the courage to have frank and thorough discussions with Allied authorities in order to obtain solutions and overcome difficulties.</p>
<p>Fourth, at the same time, the general public believes that, while the Japanese authorities are extremely concerned about the livelihood of the Chinese people, they have not yet fully understood the true nature of the practical difficulties of the people, especially the current food problem, its urgency and severity, and have not anticipated the crisis.</p>
<p>This time, rice prices have repeatedly soared for more than a week, and to this day, there are still no more effective countermeasures and emergency measures. Under these circumstances, how can the psychology of the public not become inverted and disordered?</p>
<p>However, we have already made suggestions for emergency food relief measures in our editorial on the second of this month. These are worth repeating, such as:</p>
<p>We suggest that the authorities promptly approach the Allied military for grain allocation. This is the most effective and realistic countermeasure. Has the government contacted them to borrow? Have the Allied authorities agreed to lend? From our observations in civil society, the success or failure of this suggestion seems to be resolvable within three or four days.</p>
<p>We suggest that the authorities purchase coarse grains from Huaihai Province and transport them to Shanghai for distribution. This is another thing that should be done without hesitation. Have the authorities made contact? To what extent has contact been made? Did the authorities make contact or did civil society make contact?</p>
<p>We suggest strictly prohibiting price increases for coarse grains, because there are reasons for the soaring rice prices, but the proportional rise in coarse grain prices is due solely to opportunistically seeking exorbitant profits. Do the authorities have measures to curb this? Why not implement reasonable purchases and distribution immediately?</p>
<p>Has the food control mechanism and the food purchase methods been reasonable in the past experiences? Have the Chinese and Japanese authorities jointly reviewed them? If they are considered reasonable, why is the price of food rising so crazily? If the Chinese and Japanese authorities see that the purchasing methods are unreasonable, then why don't the Chinese and Japanese authorities frankly discuss ways to improve them for the benefit of both military needs and the people's livelihood? If the Chinese authorities have already seen this and do not offer it up, taking a hands-off attitude, then the Chinese authorities are derelict in their duties. At the same time, we hope that the Allied authorities must recognize that the food problem of the Chinese people has reached its most serious point, and should deeply investigate the causes and reflect on the unsuitability of past purchasing methods. We firmly believe that the Allied forces are confident of achieving victory in the military field, and all preparations are thorough and sound, but have they considered to what extent the collapse of the Chinese national economy will hinder them militarily? This must be given serious consideration. The seriousness of the current food problem is the crisis of the national economy, and should not be taken lightly under any circumstances.</p>
<p>We firmly believe that as long as the strength of the Chinese authorities, the strength of the Allied authorities in China, and the strength of civil leadership are united, all difficulties can be overcome. Under this belief, the food problem can naturally be resolved quickly. However, these three forces are currently disconnected from each other, thus forming the phenomenon of inverted and disordered social psychology, and all urgent practical problems cannot be resolved quickly.</p>
<h3>Inverted and Disordered Social Psychology</h3>
<p>The continuous rise of rice prices and the subsequent soaring of various commodity prices is a well-known fact. Quietly observing the situation, what we first feel is the close relationship between commodity prices and the psychology of the people.</p>
<p>Half of the reason for the high price of rice lies in the psychological effect of the people. The obstruction of rice sources and the pessimistic prediction of the future of purchases can indeed promote the soaring of real rice prices. However, observing other commodity prices, the situation can be said to be the same. This pessimistic prediction may not be appropriate, which anyone who is familiar with the real situation can understand. The public suffers from their own lives by being frightened by self-constructed illusions. We have discovered the pitiable social psychology of inversion and disorder.</p>
<p>Calmly observing, food and various supplies may not be so difficult. The existing materials may not be abundant, but it may not be difficult to meet the needs of Shanghai, Nanjing, and other cities, depending on the method. The idea that if you do not quickly search and hoard now, you will not be able to buy it in the future is obviously a misconception of the people. The public themselves are trapped in hardship because of this misconception, which is a ridiculous phenomenon. Unscrupulous merchants and speculators seize this opportunity, use the psychology of the public to seek illegitimate profits, which is indeed hateful, and the public's own suffering from this psychology is an even more pitiful phenomenon.</p>
<p>In order to solve the real problems of commodity prices and food, this inverted and disordered social psychology must be corrected. However, this psychology is not formed overnight, but is produced by certain economic conditions. This point must be recognized first. No matter how powerful the enemy's propaganda is, if there are no supporting facts, its effect will be very small. If we view the changes in the current social psychology as being related to this kind of propaganda, then we must also reflect on whether we have given the enemy an opportunity to take advantage of their propaganda. Therefore, in any case, we must fundamentally review the economic conditions, and especially the issue of the comprehensive transformation of purchase and distribution institutions, must be brought up for discussion.</p>
<p>We need to deeply investigate the Chinese social psychology expressed in today's commodity price problem. Half of the inverted and disordered psychology stems from misunderstandings, lack of knowledge, enemy propaganda, etc., and half is due to the failure of various economic policies, making this kind of fear and disorder an unavoidable fact. We must frankly admit this fact, and push the work of economic reconstruction. If we want to reform social psychology, we must first eliminate the economic and social conditions that cause it. We are now merely shouting loudly in response to the psychology of the public. To correct this inverted and disordered psychology, we must deeply consider the true improvement of economic policies.

<h3>Impressions of Northern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>— Huang</p>
<p>This reporter went to Northern Jiangsu for about a month. The counties and districts visited included Dongtai County, Xinghua County, Jiangdu County, and Angjian and Dazhong Towns. Other places such as Gaoyou, Xinghua, Tongzhou, Rugao, Haimen, and Jingjiang were not visited due to time constraints, so a complete picture of Northern Jiangsu could not be obtained. This article only expresses the reporter's impressions of the places visited, for the reader's consideration.</p>
<p>The greatest suffering of the people of Northern Jiangsu currently is the cumulative levy and unrestrained collection of exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies, placing a heavy burden on them. Taking Dongtai County as an example, after a large-scale "invitation to the God of Wealth" by a certain stationed army last autumn, most of those with assets in the urban area fled. The situation in Anfeng Town, under the county's jurisdiction, was even more tragic, with even small traders and petty merchants being swept up. At that time, among the 33 Bao (unit of household registration) residents in the entire town, only two elderly men in their sixties, one surnamed Qian and one surnamed Zhou, one sick and one disabled, were spared. Every household was closed, and even buying sesame cakes and fried dough sticks was impossible. The district chief of the area also took advantage of the troop transfer to abscond with the funds, leaving the district government without anyone responsible for two months. When this reporter interviewed the residents in the town, everyone spoke with fear, gnashing their teeth. It was not until the Lunar New Year last year that residents gradually returned home from neighboring counties and districts. After this great calamity, how should the authorities be considerate of the people, allowing them to recuperate and recover? Since March and April of this year, the burden on the people of the county has become increasingly heavy, with no avenue to air grievances. When this reporter was stationed in the county, it coincided with the undertaking of borrowing 20,000 Shi of military rice. Before this task was completed, another order to raise military grain (referring to both rice and wheat) of 20,000 Shi was issued. The former was allocated to each household and Mu (unit of area) according to the Baojia (household registration) system, dividing the area into districts and towns. The latter designated wealthy households and large shops to purchase grain coupons for collection, allocating 70 Shi for large households, 50 Shi for medium households, and 30 Shi for small households, with wheat accounting for 70% and rice accounting for 30%.</p>
<p>The Dongtai County government sent bailiffs to deliver notices, giving a three-day deadline for delivery. The first batch of notified households numbered 80, and the second batch numbered 96. This only applies to the urban area, and other townships are not included. Those in power easily issue orders, unaware that those below use this as an opportunity for personal gain. The county's grain prices, stimulated by this excessive purchase, have seen a significant surge, and the people are filled with sorrow and resentment, pacing restlessly in their homes.</p>
<p>Poor Military Discipline</p>
<p>The stationed troops in various counties in Northern Jiangsu mostly adopt a defense zone system. Superficially, it seems that there is unified leadership, but in reality, they each govern themselves. In each county, the stationed troops range from a division to a brigade. Even the garrison troops in a township are often at least a battalion or regiment. Combined with the original security teams of each county, their strength can be described as considerable. However, because defense zones vary in wealth and stationed troops vary in quality, the situations in different places are often different, so one cannot compare one case to another. In addition, the different management and treatment methods of the troop commanders also affect the quality of military discipline, which cannot be generalized. Generally, in a certain area, if there are more unmarried officers and soldiers and fewer who bring their families, their own burden of expenses will be lighter, and their demand for local exactions will be better. Conversely, in a certain area, if there are more officers and soldiers who bring their families, their own salaries will definitely not be enough to cover their expenses, so local exactions are unavoidable, such as forcibly occupying civilian housing, commandeering furniture, collecting donations, and raising funds locally. Frankly speaking, with today's high cost of living, the salary of each soldier is definitely not enough to maintain their personal life. Even virtuous senior officers cannot prevent their actions from going astray. Good and weak people only seek peace and tranquility, how dare they file complaints everywhere and become enemies with the stationed troops? For example, when the reporter traveled from Taixing County to Yangzhou on May 13th, departing from Qingdun in a charcoal-powered small car, after traveling about 18 Li (unit of distance) and arriving at Jiegou, they suddenly encountered the stationed troops "sealing troops"—that is, requisitioning vehicles for military use. Soldiers, armed with guns and commanded by a company commander, forced everyone traveling in the cars to get out. In a short time, more than five vehicles were "sealed", and over fifty passengers were forced to disembark. The travelers, unable to advance or retreat, held their already paid car tickets and asked the company commander for a solution, but he simply replied, "There is no solution," and waved to the drivers to drive away. Some people are puzzled: If military requisition of vehicles is necessary, Taixing County can "seal", Yangzhou can "seal", but why not "seal" there, and instead intercept in the middle of the journey and call it "sealing cars", trapping people in a situation where they have paid the fare but have no special permission.</p>
<p>Eager for Governance</p>
<p>In conclusion, the people of various counties in Northern Jiangsu have long been living in deep water and scorching fire. Since the Director of Pacification, General Sun Liangcheng, has been stationed in Yangzhou, all parties have placed high hopes on him. However, given the complexity of the environment in Northern Jiangsu, the recovery from the decline of the people's livelihood cannot be achieved in a short period of time. Fortunately, "a hungry person is easily satisfied with food, and a thirsty person is easily satisfied with drink." After a major illness, if the people can receive proper care and attention to balanced nutrition, recovery is not difficult. In short, if Northern Jiangsu today can first start by reducing the burden on the people and rectifying military discipline, fulfilling every word and acting decisively, then Northern Jiangsu three months from now will surely have all the haze swept away and bright flowers blooming everywhere, which can be predicted.</p>
<h3>Cotton Production Increase Agreement Council Hastens to Close</h3>
<p>The Cotton Production Increase Coordination Council officially disbanded before the end of May. All of its East Expansion and Koubei Comprehensive Research Institute, and the Jiangkou Salt Reclamation Area Cotton Production Increase Agreement Council, also simultaneously announced their dissolution. A reorganization committee of the agreement council was established to actively begin reorganization work. All matters that have been completed or are still pending, as well as the large amount of remaining funds and final return procedures, will be handled clearly by the reorganization committee to ensure closure.

<h3>Denmark Values Freedom and Opposes Changing Borders</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Stockholm, 4th: A special correspondent for the Svenska Dagbladet reported that the Danish border issue had been repeatedly discussed in Copenhagen. The public generally observes that the Danish authorities currently do not want to re-demarcate the border. In response, a statement was issued in Germany stating, "If you want to change the border to weaken our country's position, causing our border to shrink to the south, then this action will inevitably conflict with the Danish people's long-cherished concepts of freedom and justice. Our country's current border is conducive to the national spirit of autonomy and cooperation. At the same time, the Danish state and society are built on this national spirit of autonomy and cooperation."</p>

<h3>Indian Newspaper Warns Britain and France Not to Harm the Holy Teacher</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 4th: According to a New Delhi report released last night, "Dawn," a newspaper published by Jinnah, chairman of the All-India Muslim League, published an article yesterday warning Britain and France not to harm the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, al-Husseini. al-Husseini was arrested by French forces in southern Germany and is currently detained in Paris. Last week, news suddenly broke that al-Husseini would be transferred to Britain. "Dawn" stated that the British government must understand that the blood of martyrs is of great value. If they intend to protect this Holy Teacher, they should quickly release al-Husseini from the custody of the French government. If Britain does anything unfavorable to al-Husseini, it would be a destruction of the entire Muslim world.</p>
<h3>Remittances from Shanghai Banks to Other Cities Reduced Compared to Before</h3>

It is also learned that if the financial situation improves in areas where circulation has been suspended, the industry will make appropriate adjustments.</p>
<h3>France Expresses Determination to Protect Syrian and Lebanese Interests and Refuses to Recognize the Independence of the Two Countries</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Zurich, 4th: A Paris report states that French Premier de Gaulle exposed Britain's conspiracy to provoke the Syrian conflict on the 2nd and expressed the French government's determination to protect the interests of Syria and Lebanon by force, as follows: The motivation for the Syrian and Lebanese conflict can be said to be due to Britain's direct provocation. Most British agencies stationed in the two countries have incited residents to oppose France, and the Syrian police force equipped with British weapons has repeatedly attacked French outposts. Moreover, the total number of British troops stationed in Syria and Lebanon is over 600,000, while the French army has only about 5,000 troops, and the rest have been withdrawn to the western desert area. The French government ordered the French army to cease fighting on May 30th. I received a memorandum from the British Prime Minister on the 31st, but the memorandum did not change the attitude of the French government, and it is unlikely to change its attitude in the future. I did not respond because of its vested interests. Regarding the current issues of the French government, Egypt, Iraq, Palestine, etc., whether viewed from a political or geographical perspective, must exist as independent countries. Regarding the necessary conditions for Syria and Lebanon to be independent, our only requirement is to conclude various treaties in order to solve the cultural and economic interests of our country, the same as the United Kingdom and the United States. The French representatives negotiated this matter with Syria and Lebanon on May 8th, but shortly thereafter, the French army was attacked by armed Syrian rioters. Regarding this conflict, the French government believes that it must be resolved through international cooperation and cannot take other solutions. The French people must unite strongly around the government, and when necessary, they will not hesitate to use force to protect French interests and dignity.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Zurich, 4th: A Paris report states that the French Foreign Minister officially stated the French government's attitude towards Syria and Lebanon to reporters on the 2nd as follows: The French government previously intended to recognize the independence of Syria and Lebanon, but now it has no intention of recognizing the independence of the two countries.</p>
<p>Syrian Foreign Minister Criticizes France</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 4th: According to a Damascus report, on the eve of the Arab League meeting, Syrian Foreign Minister al-Bey stated that "France is desperately planning a conspiracy within Syrian territory, so the relationship between Syria and France has to be severed." He also countered de Gaulle's statement, saying, "Last month, we repeatedly warned the French government that the more the French army shows its strength and increases its troops, the more difficult and troublesome it will be for Syria to seek a proper solution to resolve the conflict between the two countries, as advised by the British government. We have collected all the evidence from May 20th to 26th, which is sufficient to prove that France has ambitious intentions in Syria, so General de Gaulle's statement is merely a cover for France's conspiracy. France's recent actions have shattered the last remaining friendly relationship between Syria and France. It is clear that France is trying to obtain a special privileged position in Syria, but now it has obtained a special right that is not as good as it intended. We are preparing everything to solve this problem based on justice and equality. We sincerely thank Britain for its efforts." At the same time, Foreign Minister al-Bey compiled the following statistics on the damage suffered in Damascus last week: 400 dead, 100 missing and suspected dead, and 500 injured.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 4th: According to a Damascus report, Syrian Foreign Minister al-Bey will provide all possible conveniences to the current or future international committee to investigate whether France's claim that the Syrian army attacked French garrisons and various facilities is true.</p>
<p>Public Anti-French Sentiment is Aroused</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 4th: The fighting in Damascus temporarily ended on the 1st of this month, but the anti-French sentiment among the Syrian people has become increasingly intense. On the 2nd, large-scale demonstrations against French imperialism were held in various places. According to a Reuters report from Damascus, anti-French groups of Syrian residents attacked the French guard headquarters in the city on the 2nd, killing and wounding three French soldiers. The British authorities have announced that a curfew will be in effect for Damascus residents from 1:00 PM on the 2nd.</p>
<p>French Troops and Civilians Withdraw from Syria</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 4th: According to a Damascus report, French troops and their families withdrew from Syrian cities and towns under the protection of British troops. They were busy all day yesterday retreating along small paths to avoid Syrian demonstrations. Currently, all French citizens have been completely evacuated to a special concentration camp in Beirut, the capital of Lebanon.</p>
<p>France Hopes the Soviet Union Will Mediate</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Zurich, 4th: A Paris radio broadcast stated that regarding the Syrian-Lebanese conflict, it is generally believed that the Soviet Union will sympathize with France. It is believed that the Soviet Union will not only observe the dispute with fairness and impartiality, but also avoid provoking friendly countries and will be able to put forward reasonable and verifiable solutions to the parties involved.</p>
<h3>Candidates for Italian Prime Minister Determined</h3>

<h3>Securities Transaction Income Tax to be Levied Starting the 7th, Taxation Methods Announced</h3>
<p>The Shanghai District Collection Bureau of the Income Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance believes that securities transactions are a type of temporary profit-making business, and the Provisional Income Tax Regulations already have provisions for this, so taxes should be levied in accordance with the law. The bureau has drafted methods for collecting securities transaction income tax, which have been submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval and are said to be implemented on the 7th of this month. The methods are recorded below:</p>
<p>Article 1 These methods are formulated in accordance with Article 1, Category C of the amended Provisional Income Tax Regulations, and Article 12 of the Implementing Rules.</p>
<p>Article 2 Securities income tax shall be withheld by the broker who buys and sells on behalf of clients.</p>
<p>Article 3 Each broker shall carefully fill out a "Securities Transaction Certificate" when buying and selling on behalf of clients. The transaction certificates shall be issued by this Bureau.</p>
<p>Article 4 Brokers may not buy or sell on behalf of clients without a transaction certificate issued by the Bureau. Violators will be ordered to suspend business.</p>
<p>Article 5 When each broker sells securities on behalf of clients, they shall calculate the actual amount obtained based on the purchase price on the transaction certificate and withhold income tax in accordance with the tax rates stipulated in Article 4 of the amended Income Tax Regulations. If the purchase amount has been sold in full, the transaction certificate shall be collected.</p>
<p>Article 6 If a client holding securities wishes to sell a portion of the purchase amount on the transaction certificate, the broker</p>
<p>Article 8 Each broker who withholds securities transaction income tax and fulfills their withholding obligations in accordance with legal procedures shall be given a 10% reward.</p>
<p>Article 9 If each broker fills out securities transaction certificates and colludes with clients to cheat, or engages in transactions outside the market, they will be investigated and prosecuted according to law if discovered.</p>
<p>Article 10 Each broker shall send the transaction certificates collected on the same day to the Bureau for verification and submission to the national treasury along with the income tax payments on the next day. After obtaining a receipt, the broker shall forward it to the taxpayer.</p>
<p>Article 11 After the promulgation of these methods, all those who hold special coupons, whether they are public bonds, company stocks, or shares, shall register with the Bureau within one month.

<h3>Yesterday's Tea Party by Four Organizations: Farewell to Minister Matsushima; Over Five Hundred Attendees in High Spirits</h3>
<p>Colonel Matsushima, the press officer of the Japanese Fleet stationed in China, has been honorably transferred to an important post. Four organizations in this city—the Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association, the National Diplomacy Promotion Association, the Shanghai Branch of the China Journalists Association, and the Magazine Association—held a farewell tea party yesterday (the 4th) afternoon at the Kang Le Restaurant. Minister Matsushima, accompanied by Lieutenant Commanders Matsumoto and Hirata, arrived promptly. Representatives from the four organizations, Wen Ziting, Yuan Ludeng, Chen Binhe, and Lu Feng, received them. Also in attendance were Director Gu of the Municipal Propaganda Office, Aoki Setsu, Motomoto Toraji, Akahoshi Tamemitsu, Osaka Koichi, Hidaka Seima, Lin Kanghou, Chen Shaowei, Zhao Zhengping, Chen Riping, Xiang Kangyuan, and over five hundred other people. First, Yuan Ludeng, chairman of the representatives of the four organizations, delivered a farewell speech. Then, Minister Matsushima gave a speech in response. Subsequently, representatives from the various organizations, Chen Binhe and Lu Feng, gave speeches. Finally, Minister Matsushima also recited a poem. The atmosphere was extremely convivial.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>Chairman Yuan Ludeng's speech briefly stated: "Minister Matsushima is leaving his post, so the four organizations are holding this tea party to show our respect. Since Minister Matsushima took office, he has worked hard on his reporting duties. Not only is the press deeply grateful, but various organizations in Shanghai have also benefited greatly. We hope that after Minister Matsushima's honorable transfer, he will continue to remember Shanghai and continue to assist us in our joint efforts to complete the Greater East Asia War."</p>
<p>Minister's Reply</p>
<p>Minister Matsushima said: "Today, I am deeply grateful for the warm farewell from the four organizations. Since I arrived in Qingdao in August of the year before last, major changes have occurred. However, thanks to your sincere cooperation, the reporting tasks I have shouldered have been completed successively without any failures. I am especially grateful for this. This is my fifth time in China, but this time I have gained the best understanding of China and a deep understanding of the sentiments of the Chinese people. I have studied Chinese since childhood and have a deep impression of China. Therefore, my relationship with China can never be separated. At this time of war, as a soldier, I am responsible for reporting work. In particular, I hope to do my best to promote the overall peace of China. I will continue to work hard in accordance with my original intentions and hope that you will continue to work hard for the construction of Greater East Asia."</p>
<p>Chen Binhe's Speech</p>
<p>I remember two years ago, on September 3, 1943, when Colonel Matsushima assumed office as the Fleet Press Officer and hosted a reception for the city's journalist group, he said to us: "From now on, we must thoroughly understand the meaning of the Greater East Asia War, use the true value of Eastern culture to smash the enemy's violent aggression, and strive for final victory. Those of us who are responsible for reporting should be even more aware of the increasing importance of our responsibilities. We must be unyielding and unwavering, which is our creed. I hope to work with you, with the unified spirit of the Japanese Navy, to activate the reporting front and complete our heavy responsibilities." Looking back over the past two years, it can be said that Minister Matsushima has fully accomplished what he said. What we cannot forget in particular are the following two things:</p>
<p>First, he helped and guided those of us who are responsible for reporting to unite and cooperate ourselves. Minister Matsushima has provided great assistance to the past Journalists Association, enabling the association to fulfill its own tasks in the major situation. Later, when the China Journalists Association was established and the Shanghai Journalists Association was reorganized into a branch, Minister Matsushima made every effort to help us establish the new organization. Since then, China's news reporting industry has a unified core organization.</p>
<p>Second, due to the development of time in recent years, the situation of Shanghai's news industry has become increasingly difficult, especially the problems of printing paper, electricity supply, news reporting materials, and the improvement of news reporting content and succession operations, etc., all rely on Minister Matsushima's enthusiastic guidance and assistance to solve them, so that we gradually overcome the difficulties.</p>
<p>Minister Matsushima has been able to perfectly realize his ambitions in China. What we admire is that, first, he is a veritable enthusiast who studies Chinese issues. He has come to China successively in 1931, 1932 to 1933, 1937 and 1939, and has a deep sympathy for our country's situation. Second, he himself is a literary writer, a Confucian general, who is good at presenting and is close to the Chinese people, and our news media takes it upon ourselves to be the mouthpiece of the people, so we can understand each other very well.</p>
<p>Now that Minister Matsushima is honorably transferred back to his country, we inevitably feel a kind of spiritual loss. Fortunately, the minister is still continuing to promote the work of completing the Greater East Asia War. We will continue to fight under the same goal in the future. Today, I would like to specifically ask the minister to bring to the Allied countries and hope that the Chinese and Japanese public opinion circles will work together to realize that we must complete the cooperation between China and Japan with redoubled efforts. We always believe that the close and sincere cooperation between China and Japan is the prerequisite for completing the Greater East Asia War and solving the East Asian problem. The more difficult the situation, the more firm our beliefs should be, the more our efforts should be strengthened, and the practice and completion of China-Japan cooperation should be based on adapting to the other party's national conditions and public sentiments, and grasping the other party's public mind as the basic direction. I wish the minister good health and a happy future.</p>
<p>Li Sihao Wrote a Poem to Say Goodbye</p>
<p>Also, Li Sihao, chairman of the China Journalists Association, wrote a poem to bid farewell to Minister Matsushima, who was honorably transferred to an important position. The original poem is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>*Light fur in old general style,*</p>
<p>*Sea-faring achievements amid opening waves.*</p>
<p>*Bold and straightforward as Chen who startled the seat,*</p>
<p>*Subtle arguments flow beneath the tongue.*</p>
<p>*First meeting at Songbin, discussing poetry,*</p>
<p>*Straightforward liver and lungs go into the matter.*</p>
<p>*Reluctant farewell and sorrow for the times share the same distress,*</p>
<p>*Looking forward to preserving the late-blooming virtue together.*</p>
<p>*Both talented and chivalrous, yet refined,*</p>
<p>*Especially presenting this poem to you,*</p>
<p>*Parting at the river, a cup of wine,*</p>
<p>*Thoughts of departure often circle over the sea of clouds.*</p>

<h3>Centralized Purchase of Miscellaneous Grains: Emergency Measures to Solve the Rice Shortage in the City</h3>
<p>Recently, the market price of rice and grain has shown a sharp rise again, and the degree of violence has exceeded the past record. Although middle and upper-class families have some stored rice, the majority of civilians do not have overnight food, accounting for nine out of ten. Even those with stored rice, if not replenished, will not be able to support it for a long time. People are panicked and cannot live a peaceful day. If emergency relief is not carried out quickly, not only will all industries collapse, but it will also cause a crisis in public security. The Municipal Advisory Committee, as a public opinion organ, is unwilling to sit idly by. It seems that it should immediately assist the Municipal Government in formulating an emergency relief plan to relieve the plight of the citizens. Based on the perspectives we can see, we will present the following measures:</p>
<p>According to various investigations, it is feared that it will be impossible to obtain a sufficient source of rice and grain in the short term. Therefore, the countermeasure to relieve the rice panic in this city is to try its best to enrich the source of miscellaneous grains to meet the urgent needs. Miscellaneous grain producing areas such as Huaihai Province are rich in production and will be able to supply it fully.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Government should establish a Miscellaneous Grain Purchase and Distribution Committee to preside over the purchase, transportation, and distribution of miscellaneous grains, with special responsibility. The Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, the Director of the Economic Bureau, and the Director of the Social Welfare Bureau are all Fu Ran members. In addition, several chairpersons of the Rice and Grain Control Association, consulting committee members, and directors of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce are hired as committee members.</p>
<p>The types of miscellaneous grains to be purchased are announced by the committee after investigation. The target for the first batch of purchases is one million yuan, and then they will be collected one after another. Adjustments will be made depending on the changes in the situation.</p>
<p>Each industry association in this city may sign an agreement with the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to purchase miscellaneous grains. Each unit is at least 400,000 yuan, of which 50% is distributed to members and workers by the trade unions, and 50% is purchased by the committee and sold to the public at a reasonable price. The proceeds from the sale will be used to repay the funds of the trade unions that purchased the grain.</p>
<p>Each trade union that purchases miscellaneous grains should pay a deposit of 50% in advance. The remaining 50% of the price will be paid by the committee with a request to the Central Reserve Bank for advance loans to meet the needs of the situation. After the goods are received, each trade union will pay for the goods and ship them.</p>
<p>Commercial firms, factories, charitable organizations, and homes that have not joined the trade union may also pay the full price in advance and purchase miscellaneous grains from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Each unit is at least 200,000 yuan, but if the stock in the production area or the transportation capacity is insufficient, the purchase amount of the trade unions should be purchased and transported first.</p>
<p>The above are just outlines. The effectiveness of this matter depends on its swift action. Detailed rules should be formulated quickly and implemented as soon as possible to meet the needs of the situation. Otherwise, when the water of the West River arrives, the dried crucian carp will have died. What is the use? What is more, the seriousness of the rice shortage problem is closely related to the skin of every citizen. Even those who have rice stored for a year or several months will have a very short period of time if the price of rice does not fall. Therefore, they are still threatened by the high price of rice in their minds. Therefore, all citizens should work together and cooperate to solve the difficulties. Do not have the mentality of watching the fire from the other side, which will harm yourself and others.</p>
