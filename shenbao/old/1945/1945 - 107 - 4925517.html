<h3>冲繩島四周敵艦船　續擊沉毀廿二艘　日軍陸海空一體大舉進攻</h3>
<p>日大本營發表</p>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　日大本營十六日下午四時發表：　冲繩本島南部敵軍，因日軍反擊，受慘重打擊，但目下似仍積極準備攻勢，該處日軍部隊，繼續把　良機，發砲轟擊或實行挺進衝殺，摧毀敵軍攻擊準備。四月十二日至十五日止，該方面予敵軍損害，業經查明者約一千七百人，本部半島方面戰事逐趨熾烈化。　日航空部隊其後繼續猛攻冲繩本島四周敵艦船及機動部隊，十一百以後日方所獲戰果，業經查明者如次：擊沉航空母艦一艘，巡洋艦艘，巡洋艦或運輸船一艘，驅逐艦一艘，運　船一艘，　型不詳者一艘，擊毀戰艦二艘，船型不詳者十三艘。</p>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　冲繩本島海面日軍，對敵機動部隊艦船團之作戰，日趨激烈，現已形成海陸空渾然一體，大舉進攻。尤以十二日以　，日精銳戰鬥機隊沿琉球列島南下，向敵防衛空軍挑戰，更與特別攻擊隊協同步驟出擊，戰門情勢刻趨熾烈，目下日方全體特攻隊到處搜　捕捉敵織動部隊艦船團，加以殲滅打擊，此航空快戰之性格，日軍全　加人特攻隊，不期生還，軍心大振，其戰門之激烈，可推想而知矣。</p>
<p>冲繩登陸敵軍　傷八千以上</p>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　冲繩本島南部地區之日軍部隊，十二日以來，於步砲密切協同之下，予敵甚大打擊，現敵攻勢頓挫，陷於停頓狀態，然敵恃大量物資，其後一意增强補給，冒火砲不絕之下推進輸運軍需品，準備再度反攻。為呼應此情勢，敵之艦砲射擊，殆集中首里周圍，日軍駐在部隊，正伺機候敵，乘時大舉邀擊。十二日至十五日之本島南部陸上戰門之戰果，正如十二日日大本營發表，殺傷人負達一千七百名，合過去截至十一日之本島全戰局，殺傷人員六千七百名，敵自上陸以來，單人員損害，已達八千以上，而日方損害殊為輕微。又北方地區本部半島之戰况，亦漸次熾烈化，日軍駐在部隊繼續展開猛烈攻勢，一方對北中飛機塲，敵之小型機進出相當活發，十五日薄募，日航空部隊强襲該兩飛機塲，查明中飛機塲於午後六時四十分許發生大爆炸，北飛機場於七時三十分許兩處起火燃燒。又日軍特攻隊對本品周邊洋上之敵艦船團繼續加以猛攻。</p>
<p>日特攻隊奮戰勇士視死如歸</p>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　據日海軍航空基地訊：日海軍航空部隊，現仍繼續攻擊冲繩島四周之敵機動部隊，十三日黎明後天氣轉晴，再度大舉進攻，勇士莫不視死如歸，每日出發前綫，多有作戰殉身而未返者，攻擊隊勇敢轟炸，並掃射中部北部兩飛機塲，予敵重劍，然據上午日機偵察，冲繩局邊之敵艦隊遂漸減少，發見仍有敵戰艦二至三艘，巡洋艦五十六艘，大小運輸船七八十艘，在海面游弋。據下午偵察，於冲繩本島北端東方洋面，發現由三羣組成，加入特設母艦及其他母艦共八艘之敵機動部隊，　間之攻擊日機達一進數十架，內有最新銳戰鬥機，另有神風特別攻擊隊機多架策應作戰，薄暮夜間攻擊隊以重轟炸機出擊，十一時許起迄深更，於基地上空往來攻擊並突入敵艦船羣，炸沉其巡艦二艘，焚燒其戰艦一艘，日機全部平安返防。同時，雷擊隊發放百發百中之魚雷，將敵特設母艦二艘，艦型不明者一艘立刻炸沉，其他五敵艦起火焚燒。晝間神風特別攻擊隊之詳細戰果，尙未查明，因日機於敵強大制空陣容下，敢死出動，料必獲得煊赫之戰果。又據前綫司令部所收到之敵方廣播中，有倘若日軍之强大攻擊再繼續一兩星期，太平洋戰爭將引起最大悲劇等語，可知日機攻擊勇敢及敵人惶懼之一斑。</p>
<h3>空襲京濱敵機　墜毀逾百架　日大本營昨發表戰果</h3>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　日大本營十六日下午六時發表謂：據後來調查，已悉四月十五日晚來襲京濱西市部之敵機，擊落數增加至七十架。</p>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　日大本營十六日下午四時發表：　四月十五日下午十時三十分許起，約歷二小時三十分，B29型敵機約二百架、大部份夾　京濱西南部，敵機濫炸，致市街地區發生相當火災，至十六日五時前均吿熄滅。　日制空部隊所獲戰果，業經查明者如次：擊落五十五架，擊傷五十架以上。</p>
<p>被炸各處損害查明</p>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　敵美機B29型若干架，十五日夜至十六日曉，執抝盲炸東京，此次敵空襲目標為京濱西南地區，當經查明於帝都。蒲田·大森·品川各區遭受相當損害，其他之數區，亦有一部被炸。蒲田·烏井阪兩警察署及蒲田區公所，麻布郵政局均被炸燬。又日連宗總本山池上本門寺亦化烏有，帝國女子醫專病院，怡和女子英專校及中等學校，國民學校等數校，均中彈起火燃燒。敵美不顧人道盲炸文化機關，獸性愈益暴露，於神奈川縣，則以川崎巿受害最甚，橫濱巿之一部亦發生大火，以致川崎警察所，日大預科病院，丸子病院，中原病院等均起火燃燒。日本民間防空團與日軍制空部隊互相呼應，果敢邀擊，尤以滅火及待避之機敵行動，故東京及神奈川縣之人員彼害極為少</p>
<p>九州台灣等地空襲</p>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　敵小型艦載機約百架及B25型機數架，十六日下午零時五十分左右，又來襲九州南部地區，在鹿兒島及宮崎縣南部施行轟炸及機槍掃射，至一時四十分遁去。</p>
<p>鹿兒島十六日中央社電　十五日下午三時三十分許，敵小型艦上機約四十架，從種烏海面來襲大隅半烏，以機槍掃射後，四時二十分向南遁去。</p>
<p>台北十六日中央社電　菲烏基地之敵　炸機十五架，十五日畫間數次來襲台灣新竹·台中，對於軍事設施及一般民家施行盲目轟炸，日方已查明或至目前止擊落B24型機四架，地上被害尚待調查</p>
<h3>日空軍猛攻　中緬機甲隊</h3>
<p>緬甸前綫基地十五日中央社電　日航空部隊十二日晨猛攻侵入緬甸中部耶美基附近之敵機甲部隊，投彈命中敵車輛隊，當有戰車等車輛五輛及物資推積所一處起火焚燒，並擊毀其五十五輛以上。</p>
<h3>渝美機濫施轟炸　老河口成廢墟　華南日軍完成防禦陣勢</h3>
<p>老河口十五日中央社電　老河口於日軍猛攻之下，終於八日遂吿陷落，惟該地市中心及飛機塲碼頭等，均遭敵美空軍不分畫夜濫施轟炸，全市幾成廢墟，八日以來為火燄所籠罩，漢水幾染為紅色，過去駐渝美空軍對陷落之據點，向無積極反攻，惟此次作戰實施澈底的焦土戰術，此點殊值重視。</p>
<p>大陸基地十六日中央社電　最近菲島基地之美空軍，對大陸方面之攻擊漸形熾烈，改取戰略　炸方式。查敵美整頓菲烏基地開始攻擊，時在二月中旬，直至三月中旬，敵機攻擊目標專向沿岸船舶，企圖搗亂海上接濟路綫，後少數敵機每在深夜或拂曉反覆來襲華南方面要地。本月氣候轉好後，敵機乃開始白畫轟炸，推測其目標似在謀破壞倉庫地帶·軍事設施·港灣船渠·及船舶等日軍接濟設備。同時中國內地美空軍時以戰鬥機為主，或混以少數轟炸機，不斷來襲桂林·柳州·丹竹·梧州·南寗等日軍後方基地，企岡阻礙日軍使用該等基地，惟未獲效果，因此敵方力圖在靠近和平區之地點設立基地，但日航空部隊現已完成防禦陳勢，準備繫滅敵人。</p>
<p>總反攻企圖已化為泡影</p>
<p>河南前線十五日中央社電　渝方於去秋以來，高呼對日總反學，積極使第五戰區成為美國化，惟今以老河口已吿失陷，敵方企圖頓成泡影。敵方於作戰前，故意虛張聲勞，其所謂六月對日反攻，內幕究竟如何，不外乎因湖南作戰廣西作戰屢遭失敗，渝方不能再對美國舞白或推卸責任，致美國出而干涉，實行改革「抗戰陣綫機構」，如調動軍政政部長即為一例。渝方以迭次戰敗，攸關顏面，一方面受美國强迫，於是企圖對日反攻，動員學行十萬人，並選擇優秀知識靑年，在雲南方面與美國化裝備之軍隊，混合改編為美式渝軍，並為增強對日反攻前鋒部隊，調中央嫡系之劉峙，替代第五戰區司令李宗仁。又史蒂威爾公路打通後，大約至六月可從美國裝運軍需，接濟第五戰區，故敵人夢想以今年六月為對日總反攻之最好機會，然老河口已被日軍佔領，敵方反攻計劃業吿失敗無疑。</p>
<h3>日政府協議　戰災對策</h3>
<p>內枂奏明損害</p>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　日政府十六日下午五時半在首相官邸開閣員　談會，對於此次戰災，協議種種對策。</p>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　日安部內相十六日下午四時半晋宮，覲見天皇，奏上今晨空襲被害情形。</p>
<h3>敵美戰略失利　崩潰期不在遠　軍事專家分析戰局</h3>
<p>中央社滬訊　最近世界戰局，不論歐亞戰塲，均趨緊張，其發展情形，殊堪注意，頃由軍事專家分析戰局如次：</p>
<p>冲繩敵軍毫無進展</p>
<p>關於冲繩　南部戰况。據敵方所發表，敵軍自攻佔那覇後，在距離津波將近五公里處，陷於停頓狀態，並據敵方步兵將校廣播所稱，在該處一帶之美軍，已遭受日本自太平洋戰爭開戰以來，空前猛烈之砲擊。如今敵方艦艇減少活動，即如敵艦砲之射擊，以及航空機之掩護，在北部敵軍，雖在大砲掩護下，亦無所逞，目前已亳無進展。關於攻擊方面，敵在先制及集中兵力上雖具有利地位，而仍不能進展，已足證明日軍在作戰上之成功，深信不久敵軍即可潰滅。並有日本之特別攻擊隊，連日朝夕不斷向冲繩島附近之敵艦艇及機動部隊實施猛列之攻擊，故在該處一帶之敵艦，損失慘重。據日本大本營所發表，敵艦損燬三百餘艘，在該處之艦艇，已遭日軍消滅六成，尚在日本土西部集中之大部航空部隊，不久即身為特別攻擊隊，擊滅敵人，深信敵之潰滅，已不在遠。並據敵方所稱：自所羅門島所攻至今，閱時二戰，尼米茲施展戰略，未見失敗，但至最近則陷於泥沼，即表現種種不利情勢，尤其最近美總統羅斯福之暴卒，敵美為應付當前情勢，定將遭遇頗多困難。茲據敵美發言人廣播所稱：關於美國陸海軍之政策，均有旣定方針，今羅斯福雖逝，仍遵照羅氏生前之旣定方針做去，毫無妨碍。至美陸海軍之遵照旣定方針作戰，足以證實美軍無能，查作戰策略，須具有隨機應變之能力，故如此美軍之死做，實屬無能已極。現在美軍在海上艦艇損失嚴重，而在陸上又不能進展，因此敵美戰略，顯將步上崩潰之途，他如呂宋島中北部戰况，日軍已展開激烈之韱滅戰。</p>
<p>日軍兩路進攻芷江</p>
<p>關於大陸戰况，日陸軍已在前數日佔領老河口，如今老河口週團地帶，僅有小戰鬥。根據敵方報道，敵為企圖奪回贛州，會分隊襲擊，但經日軍巧妙進擊，已將之擊退，同時又據敵所發表者，日軍分二路進攻芷江，該兩綫均為美在渝空軍重要基地，如今即將為日軍所攻佔，已表現美在渝空軍節節後遁。查今敵美航空部隊，不但向上海侵襲次數與機數之減少，而對津漢綫，粵漢綫之侵襲次數及機數，減少限制，實由於上述之日軍作戰所受嚴重影響。然敵方為掩護損失，一方面由於羅斯福逝世，為點綴情緒及掩飾作戰之敗退，先後以一機向滬空襲，此次來襲之敵機，據敵所發表者為哨戒機，其轟炸方法完全出諸盲目炸術，一彈落於江上，一彈落於上海北部之民家，屠殺無辜中國民衆，僅三人負傷而已。故敵之攻擊目標，我人已可一目瞭然，因此在滬市民，對此非人道少盲炸，應奮起作萬全之準備，及萬全之自衛措置，尤其對此無意義之　炸，絕不可有所動搖。</p>
<p>關於緬甸戰況：在緬之敵軍從北南下，而日軍已奮勇將數擊退，不久該處一帶，即將届雨季，因此敵在該處戰況，即將吿一段落。</p>
<p>德軍尙可作戰兩年</p>
<p>關於歐戰方面：在東部戰綫，距柏林六十英哩之奧得河，過去蘇軍攻勢停頓，於最近又表現前進趨勢，尤其在斯丹丁與布累斯勞間之二百英哩，蘇軍竟一致進攻，至在東方南部戰綫之維也納攻防戰綫大部穌軍，抑向南行或向西走？或向捷克斯拉夫進擊？一般人頗為懷疑，今後蘇軍有無獲得戰果，深成問題。</p>
<p>在西部戰綫渡越萊茵河之英美軍已大舉進攻，有向漢　威前進之勢英軍向德之前進中部突破邦拿樂觀目前我人觀測德國戰況，在客觀上不能樂觀，而我人可無庸驚訝，即使東西戰綫不幸崩潰，而對太平洋戰綫亦絲亳未有影響。據日前在西綫指揮官艾森霍華曾遞呈羅斯福，其內容所述，德在西部中部之山麓作戰，情勢有繼續作戰二年之可能。回顧歐洲首次大戰時，曾遭遇失敗之德軍，在今日雖有任何困難，決忍受到底。一致奮門。同時在帝國主義之英美，社會主義之蘇聯，目前雖一時意見一致，在東西戰場，打擊德國，恐不久好夢難圓，主義不同，當離衝突之期不遠。關於英美戰鬥指導官，為一面結束戰綫，以壓制國民，稱歐洲戰爭吿一段落，並將其兵力移至太平洋作戰上，根據事實上觀，決難移動赴太平洋上作戰。</p>
<p>美羅總統逝世影響</p>
<p>關　美總統羅福之逝世，今後在世界情勢上，將有引起最大糾紛問題，其一，即為美國國內之政策，最重要者，厥為軍部之統帥問題，依前二日之情形所觀，如馬歇爾·金大將美國之陸海將軍所廣播者，對新任總統特魯曼之力量，深表懷疑，其不信情勢已從萌芽開始。餘如對于美軍人之士氣影響頗大，直接影響作戰。即以過去二日之美在渝空軍之向滬空襲，乃為朦蔽國內紛爭問題之舉動。再影響國外者，即為世界之情勢問題，影響於聯合軍所採取之情勢問題，影響於聯合軍所採取之戰力政九之政策匪淺。第一為四月廿五日之舊金山會議，預料届時決呈現混辭狀態，同時新任次總統特魯曼，已擊明不參加會議，特魯曼以大總統資格而言，果無參加之必要、惟召集該會議之發起人，乃即為已故之羅斯福總統也，於此可見舊金山會議已失去中心人物。並再將該會議加以檢討，蘇聯史太林過去已不感興趣，此次又派人民委員會委員長莫洛托夫代表參加，故在我人之觀測，覺得該會之中心如何？今後之成效，是否能為羅斯福生前所希望者，抑或完全一反羅之意見極端的程度，故在此歐洲戰局最後關鍵上，特魯曼·邱吉爾·史太林所謂三巨頭之對歐戰收拾問題，其結果常將混亂不堪，深信羅斯福之逝世，均停止進食，其情緒相當緊張。我人今以蔣介石予以考慮者，恐將為英蘇今後有新的關係之轉變，以及渝共摩擦將益趨複雜，此點在蔣本身上，常頗堪憂慮者。</p>
<p>代論</p>
<h3>出席第十四次諮詢委員全體會議觀感</h3>
<p>— 陳彬龢</p>
<p>本市市政諮詢委員會，昨天舉行第十四次全體委員會議，周市長親自出席，討論通過　要議案數件，關係戰時經濟急義重大。茲就出席觀感分誌如次：</p>
<p>血過組織上海市農村貸款銀　，　資五十億兀，對江蘇省產米區農民，直拔貸予生產資金一案。當經議決推定九人組織委員會負責推動。在討論這一提案的過程中，一致認為非常迫切需要。本報社評曾在最近期內，屢次提出取　投機與導引游資問題，反覆申說其必要性，無非針對現實環境，促起各界重視。按農　貸款之最大意義，直接在減少農民受高利貸　預賣靑苗的痛苦，間接就是增加農作物產量、尤其是反共的實際工作。白香山詩云：「誰知盤中粟，粒粒皆辛苦」，我們住在都市的人、尤其高樓大廈的有產階層，對於農民的辛苦、從來不關痛癢，一般人也只知米價高漲的痛苦·食　問題的嚴重，而並不關心農民的痛苦與需要。過去本市還有日用品供給農村，現在日用品工廠右的停工，有的也把成品囤積，絕少直接供給農民。在在形成都市與農村關係的脫節，而實際上都市與農村絕對有相互依存的關聯性。為促成這一關係，以都市所有供農村所需，自屬切要。現在諮詢會旣已通過組織農貸銀團，不過籌集資金，如發行農貸庫券，依照公事上手續需時甚久，而農村春耕在即，需要迅急，應由委員會先行趕速推動籌款。將來實施農貸有關技術事宜，另聘專冢執行。周市長對於本案審慎檢討，極為關心。羅秘書長更　推主持委員會，將來　力　多，這是值得</p>
<p>通過獎勱工商界向江蘇各縣設立日用品小型工廠案，本市各工廠，旣因電力限制及原料取給困難，陷於停滯狀態，工業界為本身出路打算，也應另闢途徑。可是，一方面也有若千工廠，資方早已盈餘累累，乘機停工，置工人失業於不顧。而一方面內地農村需要日用品極為殷切，手工業供不應求，設廠則缺乏資金技衛及熟練工人。在這樣情形之下，上海日用品工廠自應向內地設廠，或携資金技術發展內地手工業，但設廠目的應為　供給內地日用品，　救濟失業工人、　為本身謀出路並建立未來基礎。利用各地特產原料設廠製造，而不應只圖私利、猶如過去各地小型紗廠之競設牟利。希望市府不僅獎勵設廠，必要時以命令方式促成之。</p>
<p>通過管理本市公用事業案。近來本市公用事業如電燈電話自來水等，不僅屢次加價，且保證金亦一再追加，增加市民負擔。按公用事業雖屬國策公司，但應以盡量減輕市民負擔為唯一原則，如有增加收費之必要時，須於事前取得當地政府之允許，並徵取主管機關意見，避免自由行動。我們屢次指陳，現階段的中日關係已至絕對不應有隔膜的地步，政府與政府之間固應如此，民間與民間尤應如此。無論任何有關公衆的措施，必須顧到中國固有的國情民情，庶不致發生隔閡。所以，我們更衷心期待盟邦國策公司當局進一步瞭解與重視。</p>
<p>周市長首先報吿，對於最近本市投機暴利猖獗情形，表示深惡痛絕，立即命令有關機關澈查，決心嚴辦，希望市民協力檢舉。當時諮詢委員某君，提出證券交易中便交一項，在目前足以助長投機，過去決定採用便交制之原因，為刺激蹬券價值脫離不景氣氛圍，現在證券狂漲不巳、採用便交之原因消失，應暫停採用。周市長立允糾正，停止便交。同時，我們更希望兩點：　取締證券投機，不僅停止便交，並禁止場外交易，而黃金公債投機也應一致澈查取締；　强化說交監理委員會及金融檢查處職權，幷嚴格執行法令、而免尸位素餐有名無實之　。</p>
<h3>日具體行政施策由次官會議决定</h3>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　日鈴木內閣為期國政之迅速運營起見，對國議之運營採取最高重點主義，除重要國政外，各項具體行政施策，儘可能範圍內，由次官會議決定，十六日舉行次官會議時。迫水書官長對此點加以認明，希望各次官協力、故今後之次官會議，具有准閣議的性格，成為戰時行政之中心機關，負有極重要使命。</p>
<h3>日秋永中將任計劃局長</h3>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　日鈴木首相於組閣時，原定由中國軍需　理部次長秋永月三　將擔任綜合計劃局長，惟以時間關係等，暫由村　法制局長官兼任。秋永中將於十日夜　抵東京，十一日上午二時赴首相官邸訪問迫水書記官長，數度懇談，並經與各主面討論後，接受擔任綜合計劃局長官，十六日正式命令任用。</p>
<p>東京十六日中央電　日軍需省十六日發表：秋永中國軍需監理部次長　任綜合計劃局長，遺缺由陸軍中將原乙未生繼任</p>
<h3>日荒尾大佐　任軍事課長</h3>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　日陸軍省軍務局軍事課長二神氏，此次調任要職，頃陸軍省發表，任命陸軍大佐荒尾興功繼任。</p>
<h3>邱吉爾夫人　謁見史太林</h3>
<p>瑞典京城十六日中央社電　德國社訊，莫斯科廣播息：邱吉爾夫人咋謁見史太林，並視察由英方捐助所築之某醫院。</p>

<p>葡京十六日中央社電　海通社訊：美國故總統羅斯福之遺體，已於昨晨安葬於紐約海德公園，官員名流前往觀禮者極衆</p>
<h3>柏林正面蘇軍　發動新攻勢　美軍先鋒抵薩克遜區</h3>
<p>柏林十六日中央社電　海通社訊：蘇軍自法蘭克福及庫斯特林方面進攻，德軍堅守陣地，僅庫斯特林以西，蘇軍在數處作局部之侵入而已，該處戰况激烈，蘇軍損失坦克車九十八輛。德軍在法蘭克福以南，毀沃特河橋樑數座，爭奪柏林及德國中部第一頁戰事業已開始。</p>
<p>柏林十六日中央社電　海通社訊：美軍東進先鋒隊，抵達薩克遜（Saxony）工業區，艾森霍華將軍之部隊，似與東薩克遜之蘇軍距離漸近，德軍長官企圖阻止或延宕此項計劃之實現，進一步言，敵軍縱能實現上述計劃，仍不能將德國南北兩部截斷聯絡。</p>
<p>德元首行營十六日中央社電　德國社訊：馬格特堡東南之美軍，渡易北河後，即被德擲彈兵擊退。德國中部防禦戰更吿緊張，班堡之南，美軍强越薩亞爾河東進，德軍攻其側翼予以重創。向來比鍚及契尼茲前進之美軍亦</p>
<h3>韃靼尼爾　海峽開放</h3>
<p>瑞典京城十六日中央社電　海通社訊，英海軍部大臣亞歷山大昨在倫敦聲稱：韃靼尼爾海峽對蘇業已開放，蘇聯已由黑海方面獲得接濟。</p>
<h3>各省巿定期　召開民衆大會　展開統一救國運動</h3>
<p>南京十六日中央社電　自三月二十八日至三十日，各省巿戰時民衆代表會議在首都舉行之後，各地民衆一致奮起，如火如荼，充分表露國族意識之激發。蓋各地民衆深感時局之嚴重，已屬間不容髪，若不及時奮起，展開統一救國運動，則國族前途　堪設想。爰對民衆代表會議全部議決案，極表羅護熱忱，已積極負起捍國術族之任務，而對政府採納民意之措置，尤深表信賴。並悉各省市民衆定於本月二十一日分別召開統一救國運動民衆大會，揭藥「反侵略」「反割據」「反共產」之旗幟，在政府領導之下，勇往邁進，俾早日完成國民革命之時代任務。</p>

<h3>調劑現鈔需要　當局考慮中</h3>
<p>本巿各業巿塲最近數月內，現鈔頭寸忽吿迫緊，大宗款項多以支票及撥款單支付，顯又呈去年舊歷年底現鈔缺乏之狀態。據悉日來銀錢兩業各銀行鏡莊，對於存戶支付現款，均予以相當限制，超出限額之款項，則付予　款單，限制付現數額，則參　不一，銀聯會錢準庫及各行莊收付款項，則以票據佔多數，票據交換所錢業市塲交換票據數字，因之亦見增高，並有一般投機市儈，竟多種　支票及撥款單貼現牟利。據金融界方面消息，市場上現鈔　寸短少，原以各業收買農產物資而漸見流入農村，近來市上現鈔迫緊，但較去年底情況尚佳，凡持有機款單者，其郊用與現鈔相等，不必予以貼現，自招損失，加之當局及銀錢兩業，對於此事，已予注意，積極考慮解除現鈔之缺乏問題，預計不久此項困難，即可圓滿解除。</p>
<h3>銀聯會錢準庫同業存款日增</h3>

<h3>華興銀行這農貸工作</h3>
<p>— 劉豐</p>
<p>華興銀行創立之初，即兼辦農貸工作，已有四年，成效漸者，為明瞭該行辦理農貸實况，記者特往訪該行常務董事沈爾昌君，承介紹訪問中國合作社駐滬辦事處，獲得資料頗多，茲分誌如下：</p>
<p>機構範圍</p>
<p>華興銀行辦理農貸為附並不另設機構，其資金理，皆由中國合作社駐滬辦事處負責。辦事處接受各縣支社之申請而貸予款項，縣支社下更有分社，互助社以至農民。現在計有支社七十五所，已設之互助社四千處，本年度正在　立中者一千　、互助社平均包括之戶數　一百戶，故總計受惠之農民達五十萬尸、其區城及於上海，南京，蘇州，杭州，南　，掦州，虾埠，安慶，無湖，金華。寗波等地。</p>
<p>業務方針</p>
<p>攷盟邦首倡合作運動者為子　品以滿二郞及男爵平田東助，曾於明治二十四年共向提出信用合作社法於議會，至三十三年由議會通過公布施行。中國合作社之機構及工作方針，即參酌該信用合作社法決定之，其業務約有下列數端：　信用合作，從事貸款與各社員，或以農具，種籽，肥料，耕牛貸與農民，至於圍體方面則有帮浦，輾米機等。購備生產上及經濟上必要之設備供給社員使用。　指導合作，其業務除指示農民改善農業技術外，並灌輸農民以農業科學知識：　收買合作，其業務為大量收買農作物如稱米，雜　，棉花，　絲等，或於加工後渾銷之。　配給合作，業務為共同買入廉價物，如布疋，肥皂，毛巾，襪子，洋燭等，轉配與各社員，並生產必需之物品。</p>
<p>資金分配</p>
<p>中國合作社本年春耕　金用於農具者為十萬萬元，用於一耕牛者為一萬萬元。依中江縣合作社之情形　，其貸款額十畝以上者為五萬元，五畝以上者二萬元，一畝以上者五千元，其購買及修理農具費每年最高為一萬元，最低二千元，耕牛依農業增產策進委員會之配給價每頭為五萬元，灌漑費用亦包括於農具資金之內。</p>
<p>農民生活艱苦，需款孔亟，不　收獲後不論價格，急求出售，且往往於未收獲前己預將靑苗向糧行或糧販債主作抵，借高利貸以濟眉急。為免此悽慘現象發生，故又須貸以生活費等，此項秋耕資金每戶約四千元，以五十萬戶計共為二十萬萬元，肥料資金十二萬萬五千萬元，硫安資金六千萬元，又生活必需物資配給資金為一萬萬九百萬元，倉庫建設資金一萬萬元，生產事業資金二萬萬元，總計為四十八萬萬一千九百萬元。</p>
<p>中國合作社各支社因地方情形不同，為適合環境，其組織機構，資金數量及分配亦隨之而異。合作社因工作項目較多，事務頗繁，且兼營商業及收買工作，故於辦理農　方面力量殊難集中。合作社所貸出者　需以實物歸還，不收現金，此為最大之特　。又因經營其他事業之所入尙豐，故不斤斤計較於農貸之利息，然農民亦間有因貪圖薄利而拖欠者。就資金運用之對象與集中而觀，顯與交通銀行辦理之農貸略有不同。</p>
<p>農貸需要</p>
<p>目前大部份農民對於資金融通，不出典當，賒欠，抽會，預售農產及吿貸於當地富戶諸途，凡此皆為飲鳩止渴之不得已辦法，貧農備受重利盤剝之苦，窮而借，借而愈窮，愈窮愈借，終至抵唐一空，貧無立錐；由自耕農面淪為佃農，由佃農而淪為苦力，更由苦力而渝為乞丐盜匪，影響於生產治安方面者至大，比皆農村缺省金融機關之結束，故推廣農貸，實為保存元氣，復興農村，增加生產之最佳途徑。深盼各方紛起響應，以促其成。</p>

<h3>Enemy Warships Around Okinawa Island: Continuing to Sink and Destroy 22 Vessels; Japanese Forces Launch a Large-Scale Combined Land, Sea, and Air Attack</h3>
<p>Japanese Imperial Headquarters Announcement</p>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency): The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on the 16th: Enemy forces in the southern part of Okinawa Island have suffered severe blows due to Japanese counterattacks. However, they still appear to be actively preparing for an offensive. Japanese troops in the area continue to seize good opportunities, launching artillery strikes or conducting bold advances and charges to disrupt enemy attack preparations. From April 12th to 15th, enemy casualties in the area have been confirmed to be approximately 1,700. The fighting on the Motobu Peninsula is gradually intensifying. Subsequently, Japanese air units continued to fiercely attack enemy warships and mobile units around Okinawa Island. Confirmed results achieved by the Japanese side since April 11th are as follows: One aircraft carrier sunk, one cruiser sunk, one cruiser or transport ship sunk, one destroyer sunk, one transport ship sunk, one vessel of unknown type sunk, two battleships damaged, and thirteen vessels of unknown type damaged.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency): The battle between Japanese forces and enemy mobile fleet units off the coast of Okinawa Island is becoming increasingly fierce, now forming a seamless, large-scale combined land, sea, and air offensive. Especially from the 12th onwards, elite Japanese fighter squadrons have been moving south along the Ryukyu Islands to challenge enemy defensive air forces, coordinating their attacks with special attack units. The situation is rapidly intensifying. Currently, all Japanese special attack units are actively searching for and engaging enemy mobile fleet units, aiming to annihilate and destroy them. This rapid aerial warfare is characterized by all Japanese special attack unit members willingly sacrificing their lives, greatly boosting morale. The intensity of the fighting can be imagined.</p>
<p>Enemy Landing Forces on Okinawa Suffer Over 8,000 Casualties</p>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency): Japanese forces in the southern part of Okinawa Island, with close cooperation between infantry and artillery, have inflicted significant damage on the enemy since the 12th. The enemy offensive has faltered and come to a standstill. However, relying on a large supply of resources, the enemy has been single-mindedly reinforcing their supplies, transporting military supplies under constant artillery fire, preparing for another counterattack. In response, enemy naval gunfire has concentrated around Shuri. Japanese troops stationed in the area are waiting for the enemy, seizing the opportunity to launch a large-scale ambush. The results of the land battle in the southern part of the island from April 12th to 15th, as announced by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters on the 12th, are that enemy casualties have reached 1,700. Combined with the previous battles up to the 11th, total casualties for the entire island campaign have reached 6,700. Since landing, enemy personnel losses alone have reached over 8,000, while Japanese losses have been relatively light. Furthermore, the fighting on the Motobu Peninsula in the northern region is also gradually intensifying. Japanese troops stationed in the area continue to launch fierce offensives. On the other hand, enemy small aircraft are actively using the northern and central airfields. On the afternoon of the 15th, Japanese air units launched a strong attack on both airfields. It was confirmed that a major explosion occurred at the central airfield around 6:40 PM, and fires broke out at two locations on the northern airfield around 7:30 PM. Additionally, Japanese special attack units continued to fiercely attack enemy fleet units in the waters surrounding the island.</p>
<p>Japanese Special Attack Unit Valiant Warriors Embrace Death</p>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency): According to a Japanese naval air base dispatch: Japanese naval air units are continuing to attack enemy mobile units around Okinawa Island. After dawn on the 13th, the weather cleared, and another large-scale attack was launched. The valiant warriors all embrace death, departing for the front lines daily, many making the ultimate sacrifice in battle and not returning. The attack units bravely bombed and strafed both the central and northern airfields, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. However, according to Japanese aerial reconnaissance in the morning, the enemy fleet around Okinawa was gradually decreasing. Reconnaissance revealed that there were still two to three enemy battleships, five to six cruisers, and seventy to eighty large and small transport ships patrolling the waters. Afternoon reconnaissance discovered an enemy mobile unit consisting of three groups, including a total of eight special aircraft carriers and other carriers, in the waters east of the northern tip of Okinawa Island. Dozens of Japanese aircraft attacked between intervals, including the newest fighter planes, and several Kamikaze special attack aircraft supported the operation. The attack unit launched an attack with heavy bombers in the evening and night. From around 11:00 PM until late into the night, they repeatedly attacked and penetrated enemy fleet formations, sinking two of their cruisers and setting fire to one battleship. All Japanese aircraft returned safely. At the same time, torpedo attack units fired hundreds of accurate torpedoes, immediately sinking two enemy special aircraft carriers and one vessel of unknown type, while five other enemy ships caught fire. Detailed results of the Kamikaze special attack unit during the day have not yet been confirmed, as Japanese aircraft dared to launch attacks under strong enemy air defense. It is expected that they will achieve brilliant results. Furthermore, according to enemy broadcasts received by the front-line headquarters, there are statements like, "If the powerful Japanese attacks continue for another week or two, the Pacific War will lead to the greatest tragedy," which shows the bravery of the Japanese attacks and the enemy's fear.</p>
<h3>Over 100 Enemy Aircraft Shot Down in Air Raids on Keihin; Japanese Imperial Headquarters Announced Battle Results Yesterday</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency): The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 6:00 PM on the 16th that, according to later investigations, the number of enemy aircraft shot down during the raids on the Keihin western city area on the night of April 15th has increased to 70.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency): The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on the 16th: From around 10:30 PM on April 15th, lasting approximately two hours and thirty minutes, approximately 200 enemy B-29 aircraft, mostly concentrating on the southwestern part of Keihin, indiscriminately bombed the area, causing considerable fires in urban areas. All fires were extinguished before 5:00 AM on the 16th. The battle results achieved by Japanese air defense units have been confirmed as follows: 55 aircraft shot down, and over 50 aircraft damaged.</p>
<p>Damage from Bombings Investigated</p>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency): Several enemy American B-29 aircraft conducted blind bombing of Tokyo from the night of the 15th to the dawn of the 16th. The targets of this enemy air raid were the southwestern districts of Keihin, which have been confirmed to have caused considerable damage to the districts of Kamata, Omori, and Shinagawa in the capital. Some other districts were also bombed. The Kamata and Uijisaka police stations, the Kamata ward office, and the Azabu post office were all destroyed. Furthermore, Ikegami Honmonji, the head temple of the Nichiren sect, was also completely destroyed. The Imperial Women's Medical College Hospital, Iwawa Women's English Academy, and several secondary and national schools were all hit by bombs and caught fire. The enemy Americans, disregarding humanitarian principles, blindly bombed cultural institutions, further exposing their bestiality. In Kanagawa Prefecture, Kawasaki City suffered the most damage, and part of Yokohama City also experienced major fires, causing the Kawasaki police station, the Nihon University preparatory hospital, Maruko Hospital, and Nakahara Hospital to catch fire. Japanese civilian air defense units and Japanese air defense units cooperated and bravely engaged the enemy. Especially the fire extinguishing and evacuation operations limited enemy actions, resulting in very few casualties in Tokyo and Kanagawa Prefecture.</p>
<p>Air Raids on Kyushu, Taiwan, and Other Places</p>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency): Approximately 100 enemy small carrier-based aircraft and several B-25 aircraft raided the southern Kyushu region again around 0:50 PM on the 16th, bombing and strafing Kagoshima and southern Miyazaki Prefecture, before fleeing at 1:40 PM.</p>
<p>Kagoshima, 16th (Central News Agency): Around 3:30 PM on the 15th, approximately 40 enemy small carrier-based aircraft raided the Osumi Peninsula from the waters off Tanegashima, strafing with machine guns before fleeing south at 4:20 PM.</p>
<p>Taipei, 16th (Central News Agency): Fifteen enemy bombers from the Philippine base raided Hsinchu and Taichung in Taiwan several times during the day on the 15th, indiscriminately bombing military facilities and civilian homes. The Japanese side has confirmed that four B-24 aircraft have been shot down so far. Damage on the ground is still under investigation.</p>
<h3>Japanese Air Force Fiercely Attacks Central-Burma Armored Units</h3>
<p>Front-Line Base in Burma, 15th (Central News Agency): On the morning of the 12th, Japanese air units fiercely attacked enemy armored units that had invaded the vicinity of Yamethin in central Burma, scoring direct hits on enemy vehicle columns. Five vehicles, including tanks, and a supply depot caught fire, and over 55 vehicles were destroyed.</p>
<h3>Chongqing-US Aircraft Indiscriminately Bomb; Laohekou Becomes Ruins; Japanese Forces in South China Complete Defensive Positions</h3>
<p>Laohekou, 15th (Central News Agency): Laohekou finally fell on the 8th under the fierce attack of Japanese forces. However, the city center, airfield, wharves, etc., have all been subjected to indiscriminate bombing day and night by enemy American air forces. Almost the entire city has been reduced to ruins. Since the 8th, it has been enveloped in flames, and the Han River has been almost stained red. In the past, the US air force stationed in Chongqing has never launched active counterattacks on captured strongholds, but this operation has implemented a thorough scorched earth tactic, which deserves attention.</p>
<p>Mainland Base, 16th (Central News Agency): Recently, the attacks by the US air force from the Philippine base on the mainland have become increasingly fierce, adopting a strategic bombing approach. It is understood that the enemy American forces began organizing the Philippine base and launching attacks in mid-February. Until mid-March, enemy aircraft targeted coastal shipping, attempting to disrupt sea supply lines. Later, a few enemy aircraft repeatedly raided important locations in South China at night or dawn. After the weather improved this month, enemy aircraft began bombing during the day, presumably aiming to destroy warehouse areas, military facilities, harbors and docks, and Japanese supply equipment. At the same time, the American air force in inland China, mainly fighter planes or mixed with a few bombers, constantly raided Japanese rear bases in Guilin, Liuzhou, Danzhu, Wuzhou, Nanning, etc., attempting to hinder the use of these bases by Japanese forces, but without success. Therefore, the enemy is trying to establish bases closer to the peaceful areas, but Japanese air units have now completed defensive positions, preparing to annihilate the enemy.</p>
<p>Total Counteroffensive Attempt Has Become a Bubble</p>
<p>Front Line in Henan, 15th (Central News Agency): Since last autumn, Chongqing has been loudly calling for a total counteroffensive against Japan, actively making the Fifth War Zone Americanized. However, now that Laohekou has been lost, the enemy's attempt has become a bubble. Before the operation, the enemy deliberately made a lot of noise, but the true story of their so-called June counteroffensive against Japan is nothing more than the fact that Chongqing could no longer deceive or shirk responsibility to the United States due to repeated failures in the Hunan and Guangxi operations, which led to American intervention and the implementation of reforms to the "Anti-Japanese War Front Organization," such as the transfer of the Minister of Military Administration as an example. Chongqing, facing repeated defeats, was concerned about its reputation. On the one hand, it was forced by the United States, so it attempted a counteroffensive against Japan, mobilizing 100,000 students and selecting outstanding educated youth in Yunnan to be reorganized with American-equipped troops into American-style Chongqing troops. In order to strengthen the vanguard of the counteroffensive against Japan, Liu Zhi, a direct descendant of the central government, was transferred to replace Li Zongren as the commander of the Fifth War Zone. Furthermore, after the Stilwell Road was opened, approximately military supplies could be shipped from the United States and supplied to the Fifth War Zone by June, so the enemy dreamed of this June as the best opportunity for a total counteroffensive against Japan. However, Laohekou has been occupied by Japanese forces, and there is no doubt that the enemy's counteroffensive plan has failed.</p>
<h3>Japanese Government Discusses War Disaster Countermeasures</h3>
<p>Presenting Damage to the Inner Court</p>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency): The Japanese government held a cabinet meeting at the Prime Minister's official residence at 5:30 PM on the 16th, discussing various countermeasures for the current war disaster.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency): Japanese Interior Minister Abe entered the palace at 4:30 PM on the afternoon of the 16th to report to the Emperor on the situation of the air raid damage this morning.</p>
<h3>Enemy American Strategy Fails; Collapse Not Far Off; Military Experts Analyze the War Situation</h3>
<p>Shanghai Report from Central News Agency: Recently, the world war situation, whether in the European or Asian theaters, has become tense, and its development deserves attention. A military expert has recently analyzed the war situation as follows:</p>
<p>Enemy Forces Make No Progress on Okinawa</p>
<p>Regarding the war situation in southern Okinawa, according to enemy reports, after occupying Naha, the enemy forces are stuck near Tsugwa, about five kilometers away, and according to enemy infantry officers' broadcasts, the American forces in that area have suffered the most intense Japanese artillery fire since the beginning of the Pacific War. Now enemy ships are reducing their activity, and even enemy naval gun fire and air support have not been able to achieve anything in the north. Although the enemy has an advantage in initiative and concentrated force, they still cannot make progress, which proves the success of the Japanese operation. It is believed that the enemy forces will soon be defeated. Japanese special attack units are continuously launching fierce attacks day and night on enemy ships and mobile units near Okinawa Island, causing heavy losses to enemy ships in that area. According to the Japanese Imperial Headquarters, over 300 enemy ships have been damaged or destroyed, and 60% of the ships in that area have been destroyed by Japanese forces. Most of the Japanese air forces concentrated in the western part of the Japanese mainland will soon become special attack units to destroy the enemy, and it is believed that the enemy's collapse is not far off. According to enemy statements, Nimitz has not failed in his strategies since the Solomon Islands campaign two years ago, but recently he has been trapped in a quagmire, showing various unfavorable situations. In particular, the sudden death of US President Roosevelt will undoubtedly cause many difficulties for the enemy in dealing with the current situation. According to enemy spokesmen's broadcasts, there are established policies for the US Army and Navy, and even though Roosevelt has died, they will continue to follow Roosevelt's established policies without hindrance. The US Army and Navy's adherence to established policies proves the incompetence of the US military. Operational strategies must have the ability to adapt to circumstances, so the rigid actions of the US military are extremely incompetent. Now the US military has suffered heavy losses at sea and cannot make progress on land, so the enemy American strategy will clearly collapse. Regarding the war situation in north-central Luzon, Japanese forces have launched a fierce annihilation campaign.</p>
<p>Japanese Forces Attack Zhijiang on Two Routes</p>
<p>Regarding the war situation on the mainland, the Japanese army occupied Laohekou a few days ago, and now there are only small battles in the area around Laohekou. According to enemy reports, in an attempt to recapture Ganzhou, the enemy launched a surprise attack, but it was repelled by the skillful advances of the Japanese army. At the same time, according to enemy reports, the Japanese army attacked Zhijiang on two routes. These two lines are both important bases for the US air force in Chongqing, and they are about to be occupied by the Japanese army, showing that the US air force in Chongqing is retreating step by step. The frequency and number of enemy American air raids on Shanghai have decreased, and the frequency and number of raids on the Tianjin-Hankou line and the Guangdong-Hankou line have been reduced and restricted, which is due to the serious impact of the aforementioned Japanese operations. However, in order to cover up the losses, on the one hand, and to decorate the mood and conceal the defeat of the operation due to Roosevelt's death, one plane has launched an air raid on Shanghai one after another. According to the enemy's announcement, the enemy aircraft that raided this time was a patrol plane, and its bombing method was completely blind bombing, with one bomb falling on the river and one bomb falling on civilian homes in northern Shanghai, massacring innocent Chinese civilians, with only three people injured. Therefore, the enemy's attack targets are clear to us. Therefore, the citizens of Shanghai should rise up and make full preparations and self-defense measures for this inhumane blind bombing, and should never be shaken by this meaningless bombing.</p>
<p>Regarding the war situation in Burma, the enemy forces in Burma are advancing south from the north, and the Japanese army has bravely repelled them several times. The rainy season is coming soon, so the war situation there will come to an end.</p>
<p>German Army Can Still Fight for Two Years</p>
<p>Regarding the European war, on the Eastern Front, the Soviet offensive on the Oder River, 60 miles from Berlin, has stalled in the past, but has recently shown a tendency to advance again. In particular, the Soviets are launching a concerted attack on the 200 miles between Stettin and Breslau. As for the Vienna defense line in the southeastern part of the Eastern Front, will most of the Soviet troops move south or west? Or will they attack Czechoslovakia? People are doubtful, and it is highly questionable whether the Soviet army will achieve results in the future.</p>
<p>On the Western Front, the British and American troops who crossed the Rhine have launched a large-scale offensive, and there is a tendency to advance towards Hanover. British advance towards Germany. From our current observation of the war situation in Germany, we cannot be optimistic in objectively, and we should not be surprised. Even if the Eastern and Western Fronts unfortunately collapse, it will not have any impact on the Pacific Front. According to Eisenhower, the commander of the Western Front, who recently submitted a report to Roosevelt, the situation in the German fighting in the foothills of the western and central parts of the country may continue for two years. Looking back at the German army, which suffered defeat in the First World War, even if there are any difficulties today, it will be patient to the end. United and fighting. At the same time, the imperialist Britain and the United States and the socialist Soviet Union, although their opinions are consistent for the time being, and they are attacking Germany on the Eastern and Western Fronts, I am afraid that their good dreams will not last long. Different ideologies mean that the time of conflict is not far off. Regarding the British and American combat instructors, in order to end the front and suppress the people, they said that the European war was coming to an end, and they would transfer their forces to the Pacific for operations. Based on the facts, it is difficult to move to the Pacific for operations.</p>
<p>Death of US President Roosevelt Has Impact</p>
<p>Regarding the death of US President Roosevelt, in the future, in the world situation, there will be the greatest dispute. First, the US domestic policy, the most important one, is the issue of the command of the military. Judging from the situation two days ago, such as Marshall and Admiral King, the US Army and Navy generals broadcasted, there is deep doubt about the power of the new President Truman. Their disbelief has begun to sprout. The impact on the morale of the US military is significant, directly affecting operations. The US air raid on Shanghai two days ago was an action to obscure domestic disputes. Furthermore, the world situation will be affected, as well as the policies and strength adopted by the Allied forces. First, the San Francisco Conference on April 25 is expected to present a confusing situation. At the same time, the new Vice President Truman has made it clear that he will not attend the conference. From the perspective of President Truman, there is no need to attend, but the convener of the conference was the late President Roosevelt. This shows that the San Francisco Conference has lost its central figure. Reviewing the conference again, Stalin of the Soviet Union has not been interested in the past, and this time he sent People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov to participate. From our observation, what is the center of this conference? Whether the results can be what Roosevelt hoped for before his death, or whether they are completely contrary to Roosevelt's opinions to an extreme degree, so at this final key in the European war situation, the so-called three giants of Truman, Churchill, and Stalin over the issue of the settlement of the European war, the results will often be chaotic and unbearable. It is believed that the death of Roosevelt has caused them to stop eating, and their mood is quite tense. What we are now considering with Chiang Kai-shek is that he is probably worried about the transformation of a new relationship between Britain and the Soviet Union in the future, and the increasingly complex friction between the Chongqing and Communist parties. This is often quite worrying for Chiang himself.</p>
<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Thoughts on Attending the Fourteenth Plenary Session of the Consultative Committee</h3>
<p>— Chen Binhe</p>
<p>The Municipal Consultative Committee of this city held its fourteenth plenary session yesterday. Mayor Zhou personally attended and several important proposals were discussed and passed, which are of great importance to the wartime economy. Here are my observations from attending the meeting:</p>
<p>Regarding the proposal to establish the Shanghai Rural Loan Syndicate with a capital of 5 billion yuan to directly provide production funds to farmers in the rice-producing areas of Jiangsu Province, it was resolved to appoint a nine-member committee to be responsible for its implementation. During the discussion of this proposal, it was unanimously agreed that it was urgently needed. The editorial of this newspaper has repeatedly raised the issue of curbing speculation and guiding idle capital in recent issues, repeatedly emphasizing its necessity, all aimed at prompting attention from all sectors in light of the current environment. The greatest significance of agricultural loans lies directly in reducing the suffering of farmers from high-interest loans and the advance sale of unripe crops. Indirectly, it increases crop yields and is practical work, especially against communism. As the poem by Bai Juyi says, "Who knows that every grain on the plate is the result of hard labor?" We who live in the city, especially the propertied class in tall buildings, have never cared about the hardships of farmers. The average person only knows the pain of rising rice prices and the seriousness of the food problem, but does not care about the suffering and needs of farmers. In the past, this city still supplied daily necessities to the countryside, but now some of the daily necessities factories have suspended production, and some are hoarding finished products, rarely supplying them directly to farmers. This creates a disconnect between urban and rural areas, but in reality, cities and rural areas are absolutely interdependent. To promote this relationship, it is essential that the city provide what the countryside needs. Now that the Consultative Committee has approved the organization of a rural loan syndicate, raising funds, such as issuing rural loan bonds, will take a long time according to official procedures, but the spring plowing season in the countryside is imminent and requires urgent action. The committee should quickly promote fundraising first. In the future, specialists should be hired to implement technical matters related to rural loans. Mayor Zhou carefully reviewed this case and was extremely concerned. Secretary-General Luo is even more proactive in chairing the committee. He will definitely put in a lot of effort, and this is worth noting.</p>
<p>Regarding the proposal to encourage the industrial and commercial sectors to establish small daily necessities factories in various counties of Jiangsu, many factories in this city are stagnating due to power restrictions and difficulties in obtaining raw materials. The industrial sector should also seek other ways out for itself. However, on the one hand, some factory owners have already accumulated huge profits and are taking the opportunity to suspend production, disregarding the unemployment of workers. On the other hand, the rural areas of the interior are in dire need of daily necessities, and handicraft production cannot meet the demand. Establishing factories, however, lacks funding, technology, and skilled workers. Under these circumstances, Shanghai's daily necessities factories should set up factories in the interior, or bring capital and technology to develop handicraft industries in the interior. However, the purpose of setting up factories should be to supply daily necessities to the interior, provide relief to unemployed workers, seek a way out for themselves, and establish a future foundation. Factories should be established using local specialty raw materials, and should not only seek private interests, like the competitive establishment of small yarn factories in the past for profit. It is hoped that the municipal government will not only encourage the establishment of factories, but also promote it through mandatory means when necessary.</p>
<p>Regarding the proposal to manage public utilities in this city, recently, public utilities in this city, such as electricity, telephones, and tap water, have not only repeatedly increased prices, but also repeatedly increased security deposits, increasing the burden on citizens. Although public utilities are state-owned companies, the only principle should be to minimize the burden on citizens as much as possible. If it is necessary to increase fees, the permission of the local government should be obtained in advance, and the opinions of the competent authorities should be solicited to avoid taking actions independently. We have repeatedly pointed out that the current Sino-Japanese relationship has reached a point where there should be absolutely no estrangement. This should be the case between governments, and even more so between people. Any measures concerning the public must take into account China's inherent national conditions and popular sentiment, so as not to cause estrangement. Therefore, we sincerely hope that the authorities of Allied state-owned companies will further understand and value this.</p>
<p>Mayor Zhou first reported that he was deeply disgusted with the rampant speculation and profiteering in this city recently, and immediately ordered the relevant agencies to investigate thoroughly and resolutely punish it, hoping that citizens would cooperate in reporting it. At that time, a certain Consultative Committee member pointed out that the "bian jiao" (spot trading) item in securities trading currently encourages speculation. The reason for adopting the "bian jiao" system in the past was to stimulate securities values to escape the depressed atmosphere. Now that securities prices are soaring and the reason for using the "bian jiao" system has disappeared, it should be temporarily suspended. Mayor Zhou immediately agreed to correct it and stop "bian jiao." At the same time, we further hope for two things: To crack down on securities speculation, not only to stop "bian jiao," but also to prohibit over-the-counter trading, and to thoroughly investigate and crack down on gold and public bond speculation; To strengthen the authority of the Securities Exchange Supervision Committee and the Financial Inspection Office, strictly enforce laws and regulations, and avoid being useless and existing in name only.</p>
<h3>Vice-Ministers' Conference to Decide on Specific Administrative Policies</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - In order to expedite the operation of state affairs, the Suzuki Cabinet of Japan has adopted the principle of top priority in the operation of national policies. Except for important national policies, the Vice-Ministers' Conference will decide on specific administrative policies to the extent possible. At the Vice-Ministers' Conference held on the 16th, Secretary-General Hakamizu clarified this point and hoped that all vice-ministers would cooperate. Therefore, the Vice-Ministers' Conference in the future will have the character of a quasi-cabinet meeting and become the central organ of wartime administration, shouldering extremely important missions.</p>
<h3>Lieutenant General Akinaga Appointed Director of the Planning Bureau</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - When forming his cabinet, Japanese Prime Minister Suzuki originally planned to appoint Lieutenant General Akimaga Getsuzo, Deputy Director of the China Military Supply Supervision Department, as Director of the General Planning Bureau.

Lieutenant General Akimaga arrived in Tokyo on the night of the 10th and visited Secretary-General Hakamizu at the Prime Minister's official residence at 2:00 AM on the 11th.

<p>Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) - Haitong News Agency reports: The vanguard of the U.S. forces advancing eastward has reached the industrial region of Saxony. It appears that General Eisenhower's troops are closing in on the Soviet forces in eastern Saxony. German commanders are attempting to prevent or delay the realization of this plan. Furthermore, even if the enemy forces can realize the above plan, they will still not be able to cut off communication between the north and south of Germany.</p>
<p>Headquarters of the German Leader, 16th (Central News Agency) - A German agency reports: U.S. forces southeast of Magdeburg were driven back by German grenadiers after crossing the Elbe River.

It was chaired by Director Li Yingfu and Deputy Director Ying. Present were Cai Rixin, President of the Shanghai Branch of the Special Court, as well as representatives from the District Procuratorate, the District Court, the Anti-Smoking Bureau, the Security Command, the Shanghai Prison, and the Vagrant Labor Camp. The section chiefs of the Third Bureau and the judicial directors of the various branch bureaus were also present, with President Cai chairing the meeting. Various issues related to the judiciary were discussed, and Director Li suggested that, as the weather is gradually getting warmer and epidemics are prevalent, the detention centers and prisons of various agencies that detain criminals should pay attention to the health of prisoners and improve hygiene to reduce the mortality rate. At the same time, judicial agencies should strive for speedy trials to protect human rights. Secondly, the education of prisoners should be changed from the religious and abstract to practical prevention and reform education. All representatives expressed their cooperation. The meeting concluded at approximately 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>Broadcasting Knowledge</p>
<p>The Crime Prevention Section of the Third Bureau of the Police Department will broadcast "Legal Knowledge" every Wednesday at 7:20 PM on the Greater Shanghai Radio Station, starting next week, for approximately 15 minutes each time, in order to instill legal knowledge in citizens and cooperate in crime prevention work.</p>
<p>Promoting Anti-Smoking</p>
<p>The Third Bureau of the Municipal Police Department is preparing to establish a "Forced Smoking Cessation Center for Smokers" to assist in promoting the anti-smoking policy. It has ordered the Narcotics Investigation Section to actively carry out the work and has coordinated with relevant agencies. The work is generally ready, with the police hospital being used as the smoking cessation site. It will start with young smokers under the age of 30 and gradually expand to complete the anti-smoking policy. After the Forced Smoking Cessation Center is established, opium addicts arrested by the Narcotics Investigation Section will first be subjected to forced smoking cessation. After the addiction is eradicated, they will be released to the Procuratorate with a doctor's certificate, requesting the prosecutor to give them a non-prosecution decision to show leniency. However, the aforementioned former smokers who commit the same crime again will be severely punished, and those in particularly bad circumstances will be sent to the labor camp for forced labor. During the smoking cessation period, the Crime Prevention Section will send personnel from time to time to hold mental talks with the smokers. The aforementioned plan has been approved by Director Zhou, and will officially start work in mid-April.</p>
<p>Abolishing Institutions</p>
<p>In order to thoroughly refresh the internal structure of the police administration, the Municipal Police Department has abolished the Consulting Office and the Legal Research Office. However, Consultant Yao Huimo will retain his original position, and Gan Jingxian and Hu Jiashi, the staff of the Legal Research Office, will be dismissed.</p>
<h3>Authorities Considering Adjusting Current Cash Needs</h3>
<p>In recent months, the cash positions of various industries and markets in this city have suddenly become tight. Large sums are mostly paid by checks and transfer orders, again presenting the state of cash shortage at the end of last year's lunar calendar. It is learned that recently, banks and money shops have imposed considerable restrictions on cash payments to depositors. For amounts exceeding the limit, they are given transfer orders. The limits on cash payments vary. Most of the receipts and payments of the Silver Union, the Money Shop Reserve, and various banks and shops are made by bills. The number of bills exchanged in the bill exchange market has also increased accordingly. Some speculators are even discounting various checks and transfer orders for profit. According to financial sources, the shortage of cash in the market is mainly because various industries are buying agricultural materials, which are gradually flowing into the countryside. The recent tightening of cash in the market is still better than the situation at the end of last year. Anyone holding a transfer order should use it in the suburbs and it is equivalent to cash. There is no need to discount it and invite losses. In addition, the authorities and the silver and money industries have paid attention to this matter and are actively considering resolving the lack of cash. It is expected that this difficulty will be resolved satisfactorily soon.</p>
<h3>Silver Union and Money Shop Reserve Increase Deposits from Colleagues</h3>
<p>Due to price relations, the lending business of various industries and commercial sectors in this city is becoming increasingly sluggish. The cash positions of colleagues are exceptionally ample, and the number of overnight loans is decreasing daily. It is learned that recently, the Joint Reserve Committee of the banking industry and the Joint Reserve Depository of the money shop industry have received increasing deposits from their member banks and money shops. The daily statistics have been increasing, about 70% more than last week. According to this situation, it is certainly not the trend of the development of the banking, money, industry, and commercial sectors. It is an inevitable phenomenon that the funds of various banks and shops lack channels for utilization. Therefore, the crazy boom in the speculative market recently is indeed a way for the financial industry to concentrate funds on speculative businesses. It is also learned that due to previous needs, there were preparations to increase the reserve assets of the two associations. Now that deposits from colleagues are increasing daily, it has been decided to postpone the implementation of this proposal.</p>
<h3>Naval Fleet Press Department Adds Monday Regular Meetings; Director Matsushima Attends and Reports</h3>
<p>The Japanese Naval Fleet Press Department in Shanghai believes that the press mission is extremely important at a time when the situation is becoming increasingly tense. Therefore, it has added more regular press conferences. Starting this week, it will meet with Chinese journalists in this city. In addition to continuing to hold meetings every Thursday, it will add one meeting every Monday. The first Monday meeting was held yesterday (16th) at 2:00 PM at the Publishing Building on Nanjing Road. The attendees from the Fleet Press Department included Director Matsushima, Lieutenant Matsumoto, and Trustee Hayashi. Director Matsushima and Lieutenant Matsumoto immediately gave a detailed report on the recent world war situation, which lasted for one and a half hours.</p>
<h3>Minister Zhou's Handwritten Order: Securities Exchange to Stop "Bian Jiao"; Stabilizing the Market to Be Implemented Today</h3>
<p>Recently, various securities in this city have soared wildly, affecting the market significantly and hindering wartime economic policies. It is learned that Finance Minister Zhou Fohai, in view of this, in order to stabilize the securities market and suppress the rise, has ordered the Securities Exchange in his own handwriting to stop "bian jiao" (spot trading) from today (17th).</p>
<p>Securities Exchange Revises Limit on Price Fluctuations</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange has recently seen a surge in the stock market, especially in high-priced stocks, which have appreciated even more significantly. In order to prevent unexpected risks, the limits on stock price fluctuations have been revised as follows, starting yesterday (16th): 30% for stocks under 20 yuan, 25% for stocks from 20 to 100 yuan, 20% for stocks from 100 to 2000 yuan, and 15% for stocks over 2000 yuan.</p>
<h3>All Sectors Deeply Hope Authorities Will Ban Gold Trading to Avoid Affecting Social Tranquility</h3>
<p>Gold trading has become the sole target of speculators, who are fabricating rumors in the market in an attempt to profit wildly and disrupt wartime finance. The market price has risen wildly over the past week, reaching 7.85 million yuan as of last Saturday. Compared with the market price in January, it has risen more than twice. Unexpectedly, it suddenly soared again yesterday (16th), initially to 8.1 million yuan, and then to 10.6 million yuan near noon. The closing market price in the afternoon soared to 13 million yuan, setting an unprecedented new high. It rose by an astonishing 5 million yuan in two days. As a result, the prices of general daily necessities have also been stimulated to rise, and people are panic-stricken and feel insecure. This is very unfavorable to social tranquility. All sectors hope that the wise authorities of China and Japan will impose strict sanctions and ban trading as soon as possible to ensure that the general price level can be stable for a long time.</p>
<h3>Shenjiang County Defense Meeting</h3>
<p>The Shenjiang County Government recently held a defense meeting, attended by representatives of various military and political agencies, Allied Gendarmerie, 　　teams, and liaison officers. County Magistrate Xu chaired the meeting, explaining in detail the issue of mobilizing the combined efforts of officials and civilians to construct local defense works. He also submitted the draft defense work plan for each township and town, which was generally approved in principle.</p>
<h3>China Steamship Company Also Operates Sailing Ships</h3>
<p>In order to save coal consumption, all shipping lines in this city are now using sailing ships. It is learned that the China Steamship Company is also operating sailing ships on various Yangtze River lines and has entrusted agents to handle them. The sailings will be scheduled in the same way as other transportation methods. This was implemented yesterday (16th). The sailing lines include Chongming, Renjiagang, and Tiansheng, which carry cargo and also take a small number of passengers.</p>
<h3>Nineteenth-Term Household Sugar to Be Sold Starting Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The nineteenth-term household sugar for the first district, Nanshi, Zhabei, Hongkou, sixth district, Xuhua, Longcao Town, and the city center will be sold from the 18th to the 24th of this month. Each person with the 44th integrated allocation coupon can purchase five liang of sugar (old first district sells granulated sugar, Nanshi sells white sugar, other districts sell refined white sugar) at a cost of 260 national currency. There will be changes in the sugar coupon numbers and the names and addresses of the sales shops this term.</p>
<h3>Japanese Female Writer Sato Toshiko Dies in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The famous Japanese female writer Sato Toshiko, who had resided in Shanghai for many years and had made great efforts to communicate the feelings of the Chinese and Japanese people, unfortunately passed away at 10:00 AM yesterday (16th) due to a severe cerebral hemorrhage at Suzuki Hospital.

<h3>Hwa Hsing Bank's Agricultural Loan Work</h3>
<p>— Liu Feng</p>
<p>Hwa Hsing Bank began handling agricultural loans at its inception, which has been four years, with gradual success. To understand the bank's handling of agricultural loans, the reporter specifically visited Mr. Shen Erchang, the managing director of the bank, who introduced him to the Shanghai office of the China Cooperative Society. He obtained a great deal of information, which is recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Organizational Scope</p>
<p>Hwa Hsing Bank's handling of agricultural loans is attached and does not establish a separate organization, and its fund management is the responsibility of the Shanghai office of the China Cooperative Society. The office accepts applications from county branches and grants loans to them. Under the county branches, there are sub-branches, mutual aid societies, and even farmers. Currently, there are 75 branches, 4,000 mutual aid societies that have been established, and 1,000 are being established this year. The average number of households included in a mutual aid society is 100, so the total number of farmers benefiting is 500,000. The area extends to Shanghai, Nanjing, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Nan, Yangzhou, Xia Pu, Anqing, Wuhu, Jinhua, Ningbo, and other places.</p>
<p>Business Policy</p>
<p>The pioneers of the cooperative movement in the Allied countries were Zi-pin, Mantsuji Lang, and Baron Hirata Tosuke, who jointly submitted the Credit Cooperative Society Law to the parliament in Meiji 24 (1891), which was passed and promulgated by the parliament in Meiji 33 (1900). The organization and work policy of the China Cooperative Society are based on the Credit Cooperative Society Law, and its business includes the following: Credit cooperation, providing loans to each member, or lending agricultural tools, seeds, fertilizers, and draft cattle to farmers, and collectively providing necessary equipment for production and economy to members, such as pumps and rice milling machines. Guidance cooperation, in addition to instructing farmers to improve agricultural technology, it also instills farmers with agricultural science knowledge. Purchasing cooperation, its business is to purchase large quantities of agricultural products such as rice, miscellaneous, cotton, silk, etc., or to wholesale them after processing. Distribution cooperation, its business is to jointly purchase cheap goods, such as cloth, soap, towels, socks, foreign candles, etc., and distribute them to each member, and produce necessary items.</p>
<p>Fund Distribution</p>
<p>The China Cooperative Society's spring plowing funds for this year were 100,000,000 yuan for agricultural tools and 10,000,000 yuan for each draft cattle. According to the situation of the Zhongjiang County Cooperative Society, the loan amount is 50,000 yuan for those with more than ten mu, 20,000 yuan for those with more than five mu, and 5,000 yuan for those with more than one mu. The cost of purchasing and repairing agricultural tools is a maximum of 10,000 yuan per year and a minimum of 2,000 yuan. The allocation price of draft cattle by the Agricultural Production Promotion Committee is 50,000 yuan per head, and irrigation costs are also included in the agricultural tool funds.</p>
<p>Farmers' lives are difficult, and they urgently need funds. Regardless of the price after harvest, they urgently seek to sell, and often mortgage the green seedlings to grain shops or grain dealers before harvesting, borrowing high-interest loans to alleviate urgent needs. To avoid this tragic phenomenon, it is also necessary to lend living expenses, etc. This autumn plowing fund is about 4,000 yuan per household, totaling 200,000,000 yuan for 500,000 households, 125,000,000 yuan for fertilizer funds, 60,000,000 yuan for ammonium sulfate funds, 10,900,000 yuan for the distribution of essential living materials, 10,000,000 yuan for warehouse construction funds, and 20,000,000 yuan for production business funds, totaling 481,900,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The organization structure, funding amount, and distribution of the China Cooperative Society's branches vary depending on the local conditions to suit the environment. Due to the large number of projects and complex affairs of the cooperative, and the simultaneous operation of commercial and purchasing work, it is difficult to concentrate its efforts on agricultural lending. The loan issued by the cooperative needs to be repaid in kind, and no cash is received, which is the biggest feature. Moreover, because the income from operating other businesses is still abundant, it does not haggle over the interest on agricultural loans, but farmers occasionally delay payment due to greed for small profits. Judging from the target and concentration of fund utilization, it is significantly different from the agricultural loans handled by the Bank of Communications.</p>
<p>Agricultural Loan Needs</p>
<p>At present, the vast majority of farmers rely on pawning, credit, drawing lots, pre-selling agricultural products, and borrowing from local wealthy households to finance their needs. All of these are desperate measures of drinking poison to quench thirst. Poor farmers suffer from the exploitation of heavy interest rates, becoming poorer by borrowing, and borrowing more as they become poorer, eventually becoming destitute. They go from being independent farmers to tenant farmers, from tenant farmers to coolies, and from coolies to beggars and bandits, which has a great impact on production and public security. All of this is due to the closure of rural financial institutions, so promoting agricultural loans is the best way to preserve vitality, revive rural areas, and increase production. It is hoped that all parties will respond enthusiastically to promote its success.</p>
