<p>社評</p>
<h3>動態的日本政治</h3>
<p>希特勒殉國了，墨索里尼被戕害了，德國　降了，今日世界大戰的本質更明顯起來，這次世界大戰的重點，不在歐洲，而在我們的大東亞。</p>
<p>在保衛大東亞的戰爭下，中日兩國的運命是共同的。日本的運命對於中國的前途有莫大的關係。因此，日本的戰事消息刻爲我國國民所關心，日本國內政治的動向亦爲我國國民所深切注意。</p>
<p>不過，我們對於日本的政治應該從兩方面去觀察，第一是靜態的方面，第二是動態的方面。靜態的方面可以簡單的說明：日本政治的本質是以日本的國體爲基礎的；換句話說，日本的國家是以萬批一系的天皇爲中心的。所以日本的政治表面上雖是波濤萬丈，變化無窮，然而其本流却是一脈相傳，綿延不斷。至於動態的現象，雖然非常複雜，可是我們從此不變的本質出發，一切複雜的政治形態都可以一絲不紊的了解清楚，就是有矛盾的現象，也可以用迫源求始的方法，得到殊途同歸的解答。</p>
<p>現在我們不必列舉日本歷史上的實施來證明，只把最近的日本政治現象略加分析就可以知道。</p>
<p>當鈴木大將奉命組閣的消息傳出，當時一般人似乎受到相當的衝動，可是，這次內閣的改組，確是日本強化戰時體制，遠成戰爭目的必要的發展過程。大東亞戰爭發生以來，從臨機立斷的東條內閣，到提倡大和一致的小　內閣，再到今日集中人力物力，作本上決戰的鈴木內閣的發展是很自然的。東條內閣的一切設施是雷　風行的，因此繼續下去的小幾內閣力求實事求是，而力求實事求是的小　內閣到了本土決戰在即，世界局勢急變的關頭，又不能不由負日本全國重望的鈴鈴木大將來擔員此重任了。</p>
<p>日本的政治是多元的，有重臣的勢力，議會的勢力，官僚的勢力，更有陸海軍的勢力，在過去的近代政治史上，內閣的更動往往是這幾種勢力此昇彼落，互相爭奪的結果，而大東亞戰爭以來，却走上相反的途徑，這幾種多元的勢力遂漸集中起來，因爲每一度內閣的改組而集中的傾向更顯著。小磯與米內的協力組閣就是陸海軍一致的表現，大日本政治會的結成，就是議會勢力及其他民問勞力對於政府協力的表現。這次由計　劃國防國家的企電時代的迫水久常出任內閣書記官長，更可以知道，不爲外國人所深知的政府中堅新官僚，現在更加奮發起來，決意强化政府的機構。所以，東條內閣，小磯內閣，與鈴木內閣雖然在政策上不免有所差異，而在政治力量的集中的過程上是一貫的，是化多元爲一元的。</p>
<p>其次，爲什麽在謀臣如雨，猛將如雲的日本，而要請高齡的鈴木大將來組閣呢？簡單的說，因爲鈴木大將是決意以一生盡力於戰爭，幷獻身於皇室的人。因爲他早年盡力於戰爭，沒有擔任過有關政治的職務，所以現在能夠站度把各種勢力統合起來；又因爲多年盡瘁於皇室，任侍從長甚久，一方面深得宮內信任，一方面書忠報國的精神久爲國人所知，所以現在能夠貫徹君官民一體的精神。</p>
<p>總之，這次鈴木內閣的性質可以作這樣的一個比喩：在國際戰爭的暴風雨中，由一位老於航海經騐的舵手把着舵，而由最優秀的各方而的選手以全身的活力，以勇猛的精神，突破這波澎湃的渡口。</p>
<p>日本的運命與中國的前途休切相關的，我們應該堅定我們的信念，我們應該有着同舟共</p>
<p>至於假如有人問起鈴木首相對於中國的問關抱何種見解，那末，我們可以用下面的一例來解答：據說，在三月十日敵機第一次到東京盲目轟炸之後，中國駐日大使館附近也起了火，而第一個到中國大使館去慰問的·是紫色的「樞1」號汽車，坐在車裏的是當時的鈴木樞密院議長，不用說就是現在的鈴木首相。</p>
<h3>太平洋戰局轉捩點沖繩決戰</h3>
<p>敵美野心</p>
<p>自從敵美進攻馬里亞納羣島以後，已可看出其侵寇意圖的新方向。　自登陸雷伊泰·侵入呂宋島·奪取硫黃島，直到最近的沖繩本島之戰，敵美以爲日本的戰力已到限界，因而不斷出以冒險的作戰行動。他們以為日軍已受到嚴重打擊，派法握取制海制空　。這種錯誤的戰術是，日本的戰力果如敵美所想一樣嗎？日本的面答即爲沖繩本品周圍海陸特攻隊通續出擊的嚴然實施。</p>
<p>敵美派這機動部隊，侵入南西靠島，在冲繩島强行登陸，運用其太平洋烏嶼戰的一貫戰術思想，採取局部絕對優勢主義，以謀攻佔處於九州·點，妄翼切斷戰力補給綫。敵美因將日本的戰力估計太低，竟欲以此一戰底定太平洋的戰局，此點由其動員的全部主力。從敵方言，此次的冒險進攻，無異是直接侵入日本本土的準備</p>
<p>兵家大忌</p>
<p>沖繩戰局確實爲藥，此戰德勝負如何，洵可影響到以後的決戰。因此，沖繩決戰在大東亞戰爭中是有很大作用的。</p>
<p>自古以來，戰爭總是錯誤較少的一方獲得勝利。敵美誤斷日本戰力而有這次的進攻，實在是致命的謬誤。其車接的補給據點，除烏雇希及雷伊泰以外，便無可恃，其作戰的不利，無可諱飭。無論在那一點上，作戰條件都是有利於日本的。</p>
<p>沖繩決戰，也就是飛機的決戰。制空　的歸趨足以決定勝敗。全日本飛機工廠的出產品，今已直接用於冲繩前綫。而島上的日軍，非但有充分的食糧彈葉，並且損失極少，加上還有數十萬的住民從旁協力作戰。因此，冲繩決戰實在是使太平洋戰局形勢轉變的良機。敵美因其估訂的錯誤，終於犯了孤軍深入的兵家大忌。</p>
<p>自從四月六日以來。由於日軍海陸特攻嚴的活躍，敵機動部隊主力已遭到重大打擊，而敵艦戰機的想飛數目，也大爲減少。敵美雖在島上攻佔北，中兩飛行塲，而集結百架左右的小型機，但因日軍嚴加限制，也不能怎樣利用。而對其業已登陸的約四個師團兵力，由於日方航空部隊的猛攻，更非拼死接濟不可，否財便有遭受日軍殲滅的危險。總之，敵美自從登陸沖繩以來，已經遭逢最大的難關。</p>
<p>勝利曙光</p>
<p>圓顧雷伊泰島一戰的經過，最可遺憾的是日軍所注入的戰力不充分。當該方制空權德歸趨未會決定時，日美雙方各出死力，在證伊泰島上空鬥法，其間因去年十一月日軍薰空挺隊及高千穗降落傘部隊的强行着陸，戰事形勢曾一度有利於日方。在該二部隊着陸雷伊泰之後，雙方的均衡即告打破，實爲奪回雷伊泰制空權的絕佳時機，惜以後援不繼，被　的危險。但從九州到冲繼，僅大百公里的距離，所以日本的空中艦隊，正冒着惡劣天氣，連日出動·這點與雷伊泰決戰不同，是有利日本的。B29型轟炸日本飛機工廠羣，以及敵艦載機羣的急襲日本飛機塲羣，亦足表明其間的微妙動態。</p>
<p>敵補給難</p>
<p>敵美哉沖繩本島登陸四各師團，以每人九噸計算，一個月五十萬噸的補給用船舶，是絕對少坐失良機。目前，冲繩決戰的情况與雷伊泰一役相似。由於水上特攻隊，戰艦等的寶貴犧牲，以及陸海航空部隊的拼　命中，敵有力機動部隊已大半潰滅。今日的狀况，完全和薰及高千穗兩部隊强行着着陸時所造成的轉換戰勢的機會相同。這個良機能否把握呢？沖繩決戰的成敗，實　於最近注入的戰力大小，即飛機的數量。</p>
<p>自馬尼刺補給雷伊泰，頗多中途不來的。而且其給養的距　，也比到馬里亞納或到雷伊泰島爲遠，途中更不絕受到日本潛水艇的威脅，同時日本敢死的特攻機和水上特攻隊又媦集冲繩周圍，伺機猛攻。敵機動部隊爲掩護其友軍起見，業已大受創傷，結果祗得僅　特設航空母艦護衛，但最近在日軍發表的戰果中，特設航空母艦的擊沉擊毀，數量已相當可觀。其在沖繩島上的軍隊，終將成為人質，而敵美行將爲此後悔莫及！對於日本，敵美的四個師團將成誘出全部敵艦敵船的美餌。</p>
<p>迄今爲止，冲繩戰綫尚未見大　動。日軍或則誘敵入設，一舉而擊滅之，或以主力一氣突破敵陣中央，設然握取地上戰鬥的主動性，速續展開鬼哭神康的肉搏，建下大本營發表的那種驚人戰果。敵軍亦知今後的損失必累增不已。</p>
<p>日軍地上部隊擁有充分準備的食糧與彈藥，並得數十萬沖繩住民的協力，意氣軒昂，壯志淩雲。該方戰場雖從名護北方擴大到首里前面，但其間倒處有日本肉搏隊的健門。在名護方面登陸的五千敵兵，因受日軍的重壓，不能動彈，而南部的日軍主要陣地前面，敵兵遺棄的屍體不計其數。自四月十二日夜起，日軍自首里北方地區一齊轉取攻勢，猛攻構築陣地的敵兵，趁其陣線大亂之際，更派大批肉搏隊潛入其間，攪亂其內部，收得極大的戰果。</p>
<p>進退維谷</p>
<p>敵美對於洋中島嶼的攻擊，其常套手段氏舉其全力連續猛攻。例如過去在塞班島硫磺島方面，即用船艦四面圍困，加以猛烈的艦砲射擊，但對沖繩本島，其攻擊却比過去緩和，此因敵軍遭遇日本陸海特攻隊的連續出擊而受到深刻打擊的　故。沖繩島作戰開始之前，自電伊泰以至島羅希·塞班，敵美集結的兵力，估計約有七師團，其中四個師團已在沖繩登陸。其後，爲備次期作戰，敵美又在國內動員，迄今在塞班·雷伊泰第一綫，其積蓄的兵力諒近十餘師團，可是，他們雖然明知單靠四個師團的兵力決進攻下沖繩，但仍不能增派生力援軍，這是什麽道理呢？無他，即因日本特工隊的嚴密監視，以致無法蠢動。</p>
<p>機動部隊受重大打擊，而已上陸的四個師團又不能棄之不顧，必須冒着極大的危險，在日本特攻隊的猛攻之下，勉力繼續設法補給，這就是敵美最大的苦　。爲圖打破這種進退兩難的苦悶狀况，非在沖繩本島取得飛行基地，集結陸上機，以防日軍特攻機隊的反攻不可。敵美今日所以拼命整備該方面已得的飛機塲，並如飢如渴的圖謀奪取新的飛機塲，就是爲了這個緣故。（譯自四月十七日刺日新聞）。</p>

<h3>發行金證劵　有助物價抑平　中儲行木村古文發表談話</h3>
<p>中央儲備銀行發行金證劵後，該行顧問木村增太郎博士特就收國通貨膨脹之性質，將來之趨向及發行金證劵之意義，於日文大陸新報有所解答，特譯載如左﹕</p>
<h3>通貨膨脹決非惡性</h3>
<p>（問）現在世界各國，悉在戰爭期間，均有通貨膨脹之傾向﹐請問對我國通貨膨脹作如何視察？</p>
<p>（答）華中一帶雖有通貨膨脹之傾向，而其進行程序與深度，若與其他國家比較，則尚屬極度初步之通貨膨脹形態，要而言之，並非惡性的，而且絕不至有惡性通貨膨脹之發生，其原因有二：　爲根據中國古來之歷史，　爲中國現在具有之經濟力量。蓋中國在一千年前，即有紙幣之發行，本為世界最古之紙幣通貨國家，有經國多少次數濫發紙幣之經騐。唐宋時代已有紙幣發行，元朝因濫發紙幣，雖發生惡性通貨膨脹，元朝武功不可十世，而卒不及七八十年而亡者，經濟問題實為其最大原因。降及明朝亦不乏其例。清朝初葉對於發行紙幣﹐雖儘盡限制，但　正年間，濫發紙幣之再起，有此悠久歷史之經騐﹐中國國民對於通貨膨脹，已知自衛之手段﹐於不知不覺問，培養成一杯大之力量。更就現狀言之，中國爲世界有數之物資　富國家﹐吾人絕不信將因通貨膨脹而有發生經濟破產之事。若將巾國現狀與第一次歐洲大戰時之通貨膨脹比較，一九二二年秋之德國情形，正與去年秋間之華中情形略相彷彿，但一九二三年五月，德國通貨膨脹之進行，異常急激。本年五月，華中狀况，並不像德國有如此重大之變化，華中物價勝貴，迄今巳經七年，而德國僅經過四年短期之後，通貨膨脹即陷於極端之惡化，中國情形並不如此﹐但若因此即謂對於講求通貨膨脹對策可以從該，甚至沾沾百十喜，引以爲樂觀，則殊　錯誤。</p>
<h3>金證劵與物價對策</h3>
<p>（問）發行金證劵與物價對策，有何關係？（答）最近因戰局之演變及其他各種事情關係﹐物價變動之形狀，大有改變，今年一月，一般大衆之關心，集中於貨物﹐今則集中於一部份投機商品，尤其金條，一般物價騰貴之速度﹐比較去年反見遲緩，此種傾向即使以人爲方法促成之，常亦不至有多大妨碍，常然因金條之騰貴，對於一般物價所給予乏影響，自不能不予考慮，但就最近物價勝貴動向觀之，則確已行遲鈍，能將命價同時抑低抑抵理想之事，但若　將一切物價，均予壓抑，則殊爲困難。發賣金證券目的，原爲收回紙幣﹐減少紙幣流通額，亦即所以抑低物價。金條價格從來最易飛治騰遠，此次發行余證券，即所以調節之，誠可謂　時局之　體措置。</p>
<p>（間）金證劵發行準備金管理委員管理之黃金　藏於何處？</p>
<p>（答）金證劵賣出之後，即將黃金撥交管理委員，　藏銀前業聯合準備委員會內，務使人民安心購買之。</p>
<p>（問）金證券爲何分一兩劵，五兩劵，十兩劵三種？</p>
<p>（答）並無特別意義，惟使便於一般購買而已。</p>
<p>（問）賣出期間僅限三日，何其短耶？</p>
<p>（答）此次僅　第一次賣出，以後將繼續賣出，期問雖短·並無可慮之處，若將時問延長，則每日賣價必須隨時改變﹐定期三日﹐最少在三日之間，可有同一之賣價而無須隨時改變之。</p>
<h3>金條黑市可趨明朗</h3>
<p>（問）金證劵是否公開上市？</p>
<p>（答）將利用上海蹬劵交易所預定二三日內，即可上市，並指定有力者爲經紀人﹐今以金證劵賣價調節黃金市塲﹐長期間之金條黑市，當可即趨於明朗化，若金證劵能充分流通，深信對　抵物價，有極良好之影響。至於通貨膨脹之對策，世界各國均有經騐，雖經過從各種角度之探討，但歸根給蒂，終以收回流出之通貨爲第一要義，或增加稅收，或獎勵貯蓄，或發行公債，其目的莫非回通貨，此次發行金證券目的亦屬如此，吾人深信對於中國，尤其對於上海物價之好轉，將有相常之好効果。</p>
<h3>第一期金證劵　商民購買踴躍　昨最後一日售出五千兩</h3>
<p>中儲行滬分行於本月七日起至九日止開始出售第一期金證劵，本市銀錢各深及市民前往該行購買者極爲踴躍，九日爲第一期出售最後一天，購買者更爲擁擠，出售數量約達五千兩，較七八兩日售數量超過兩倍以上，足見商民對於金證券之信仰。蓋以中儲此次發行金證劵﹐備有十足黃金準備額，且羅致官民有力份子組設管理委員會負責管理，經過發行期一個月後，即隨時兌付黃金。同時准許民問組設市塲自由買賣，此種流動性投資途徑，當爲商民樂予購買。聞該行即將七八九三日出售金證劵之數量，及同額之準備金黃金全額交付發行準備金管理委員會保管，以便於六月八日起到期兌付。</p>
<h3>縣政管理處　蔡處長出巡</h3>

The meeting adjourned at 6:30 PM. Prime Minister Suzuki then visited the Emperor at the Imperial Palace at 7:00 PM to report on this matter. At 7:30 PM, the Information Bureau released the Japanese government's statement as follows: "Japan sincerely regrets the surrender of Germany, with whom Japan is allied. Japan's war aims are self-preservation and self-defense, which is Japan's unwavering belief. The rapid turn of events in the European war has no impact on Japan's war aims. Japan is determined to work with its East Asian allies to shatter Britain and the United States' desire to wantonly trample East Asia, in order to ensure the stability of East Asia."</p>

<h3>Many Difficulties in Cooperation Between the Kuomintang and the Chinese Communist Party</h3>
<p>Mao Zedong Declares</p>
<p>Central News Agency Report - According to intelligence: At the Seventh National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Mao Zedong criticized the Kuomintang and stated that there are many difficulties in the future of cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Chinese Communist Party. The main points of his remarks are as follows: "After the end of the war, the direction in which China should move will inevitably become a problem. According to some people, China should return to its old state, that is, a semi-colonial, feudal country without independence, freedom, or unified special rights. This is actually the claim of the reactionary group in the Kuomintang. If China proceeds along this path, it will be unfortunate for the entire country and for the entire world. If the 450 million Chinese people reach this state, then another world war will inevitably break out. The people of China and the people of the whole world should prevent China from moving in this direction. According to another group of people, China will not return to its old state in the future. In the future, a new nation with independent, unified, free democracy will be constructed. This is what our Chinese Communist Party hopes for the whole of China and the whole world. If China can move forward along this path, it will be happiness not only for the Chinese people but also for the people of the world. The Chinese people should work harder to guide China in this direction."</p>
<h3>U.S. Under Secretary of State Grew Broadcasts</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 8th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to a dispatch from Washington, U.S. Under Secretary of State Grew delivered a broadcast speech on the 8th, stating in brief: "As long as a strong Japan still exists, we cannot say that we have won victory. The American people and their allies must devote all their strength to the war in the Pacific. We have won a victory in the Eastern Hemisphere, but on a global scale, we are still at war and have not yet achieved victory. Germany has been defeated, but another country has been preparing for a long time. Japan, regardless of men, women, old, or young, are each responsible for killing American soldiers. Therefore, we must also change our approach. Vast resources are still in Japanese hands. The Japanese islands have millions of combatants. The location of military factories is also very important. Material storage is extremely abundant, and its entire people contribute everything to the fighting forces."</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Dynamic Japanese Politics</h3>
<p>Hitler has died a martyr, Mussolini has been murdered, and Germany has surrendered. Today, the essence of World War II has become clearer: the focus of this World War is not in Europe, but in our Greater East Asia.</p>
<p>In the war to defend Greater East Asia, the fate of China and Japan are intertwined. Japan's fate has a tremendous impact on China's future. Therefore, the war news from Japan is of concern to our people, and the domestic political trends in Japan are also of deep interest to our people.</p>
<p>However, we should observe Japanese politics from two perspectives: the first is the static aspect, and the second is the dynamic aspect. The static aspect can be simply explained: the essence of Japanese politics is based on the Japanese national polity; in other words, the Japanese nation is centered on the unbroken line of Emperors. Therefore, although Japanese politics seems to be full of turbulent waves and endless changes on the surface, its mainstream is inherited in one continuous line. As for dynamic phenomena, although they are very complex, we can understand all complex political forms clearly and consistently by starting from this unchanging essence. Even contradictory phenomena can be resolved by tracing back to the source and seeking a common goal.</p>
<p>Now, we do not need to list historical facts from Japan to prove this; we can simply analyze the recent Japanese political phenomena to understand this.</p>
<p>When the news that General Suzuki was ordered to form a cabinet came out, the general public seemed to be quite shocked. However, this cabinet reshuffle was indeed a necessary development process for Japan to strengthen its wartime system and achieve its war goals. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the development from the decisive Tojo cabinet to the Koise cabinet, which advocated great harmony, and then to the Suzuki cabinet today, which concentrates human and material resources to make a final decision on the mainland, is very natural. All the facilities of the Tojo cabinet were swift and decisive. Therefore, the continuing Koise cabinet strived to be pragmatic. However, when the Koise cabinet, which strived to be pragmatic, reached the critical moment of the imminent mainland decisive battle and the rapid changes in the world situation, it could not but be entrusted to General Suzuki, who bore the heavy expectations of the entire Japanese nation, to take on this important task.</p>
<p>Japanese politics is pluralistic, with the power of senior statesmen, the power of parliament, the power of bureaucrats, and even the power of the army and navy. In the past modern political history, cabinet changes were often the result of the rise and fall and mutual competition of these forces. However, since the Greater East Asia War, it has taken the opposite path. These pluralistic forces have gradually concentrated, and the tendency of concentration has become more apparent with each cabinet reshuffle. The collaborative cabinet formation of Koiso and Yonai was a manifestation of the army and navy's unity. The formation of the Greater Japan Political Association was an expression of the parliament's power and the cooperation of other civilian labor forces with the government. This time, Kujyo Harutsune, who emerged from the planning era of the national defense state during the Kishi era, was appointed as the Chief Cabinet Secretary, which further indicates that the core new bureaucrats in the government, who are not well understood by foreigners, are now working harder and determined to strengthen the government's structure. Therefore, although the Tojo cabinet, the Koise cabinet, and the Suzuki cabinet inevitably have some differences in policy, they are consistent in the process of concentrating political power, transforming the plural into the singular.</p>
<p>Secondly, why, in a Japan with so many wise counselors and fierce generals, would they want to invite the elderly General Suzuki to form a cabinet? Simply put, because General Suzuki is determined to devote his life to the war and dedicate himself to the imperial family. Because he devoted himself to the war in his early years and has never held any political positions, he is now able to unite various forces. Also, because he has devoted himself to the imperial family for many years, serving as chamberlain for a long time, he has gained deep trust within the palace on the one hand, and his spirit of loyalty to the country has long been known to the people, so he is now able to implement the spirit of unity between the emperor, officials, and people.</p>
<p>In short, the nature of the current Suzuki cabinet can be compared as follows: in the storm of international war, an experienced helmsman is at the helm, and the best players from all sides are using their full vitality and courageous spirit to break through this turbulent ferry crossing.</p>
<p>Japan's fate is closely related to China's future. We should strengthen our beliefs, and we should have a shared boat</p>
<p>As for if someone asks what Prime Minister Suzuki's views are on China, we can use the following example to answer: It is said that after the enemy planes first blindly bombed Tokyo on March 10, a fire also broke out near the Chinese embassy in Japan. The first to go to the Chinese embassy to express his condolences was a purple "Council 1" car. Sitting in the car was the then-Chairman of the Privy Council, Suzuki, who needless to say is the current Prime Minister Suzuki.</p>
<h3>The Turning Point of the Pacific War: The Decisive Battle of Okinawa</h3>
<p>Enemy America's Ambitions</p>
<p>Since Enemy America began its invasion of the Mariana Islands, a new direction in its intention to invade and plunder has become evident. From landing on Leyte, invading Luzon, seizing Iwo Jima, and up to the recent battle for Okinawa Island itself, Enemy America believes that Japan's war power has reached its limit, and thus continues to engage in adventurous combat operations. They believe that the Japanese army has suffered severe blows, and they are grasping for control of the sea and air. Is this erroneous tactic, is Japan's war power really as Enemy America imagines? Japan's response is the stern implementation of continuous attacks by special attack units by sea and land around Okinawa Island.</p>
<p>Enemy America sent this mobile force to invade the Nansei Islands, forcibly landing on Okinawa Island, employing its consistent tactical ideology from the Pacific island battles, adopting a local absolute superiority doctrine, in order to occupy a point off Kyushu, vainly hoping to cut off the supply lines. Enemy America has underestimated Japan's war power, and intends to settle the Pacific war with this one battle. This point is evidenced by their mobilization of their entire main force. From the enemy's perspective, this adventurous attack is no different from preparing for a direct invasion of the Japanese mainland.</p>
<p>A Major Military Taboo</p>
<p>The Okinawa battle is indeed critical. How this battle is won or lost can truly affect the decisive battles to come. Therefore, the decisive battle of Okinawa plays a significant role in the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>Since ancient times, the side with fewer mistakes in war has always been victorious. Enemy America's misjudgment of Japan's war power in launching this attack is truly a fatal error. Their direct supply bases are only reliant on Ulithi and Leyte, and their operational disadvantages are undeniable. In any case, the combat conditions are all favorable to Japan.</p>
<p>The decisive battle of Okinawa is also the decisive battle of aircraft. The trend of air control is enough to determine victory or defeat. The output from all of Japan's aircraft factories is now being directly used on the Okinawa front. The Japanese army on the island not only has ample food and ammunition, but also has suffered very few losses, and has hundreds of thousands of residents assisting in the fighting. Therefore, the decisive battle of Okinawa is truly a good opportunity to change the situation of the Pacific War. Enemy America, due to its miscalculations, has finally committed the major military taboo of venturing deep with an isolated force.</p>
<p>Since April 6th, due to the active role of the Japanese army's special sea and land attack units, the enemy's main mobile force has suffered heavy blows, and the number of enemy carrier-based fighters has also been greatly reduced. Although Enemy America has occupied the northern and central airfields on the island and gathered about a hundred small aircraft, they cannot be utilized effectively due to strict restrictions imposed by the Japanese army. And for the approximately four divisions of troops that have already landed, it is necessary to provide desperate relief due to the fierce attacks by the Japanese air force, otherwise, they risk being annihilated by the Japanese army. In short, since landing on Okinawa, Enemy America has encountered its biggest difficulty.</p>
<p>Dawn of Victory</p>
<p>Looking back at the course of the Battle of Leyte Island, the most regrettable thing is that the war power Japan injected was insufficient. When the trend of air control had not been decided, the Japanese and American sides both fought desperately, vying for dominance over the skies of Leyte Island. In the meantime, due to the forced landing of the Japanese airborne troops and the Takachiho parachute unit in November of last year, the war situation once favored the Japanese side. After these two units landed on Leyte, the balance between the two sides was broken, and it was an excellent opportunity to regain air control over Leyte. Unfortunately, subsequent support was lacking, creating a danger of [being cut off]. However, from Kyushu to Okinawa is only about 300 kilometers, so the Japanese air fleet is braving bad weather and deploying every day. This point is different from the decisive battle of Leyte and is favorable to Japan. The B29 bombers bombing Japanese aircraft factory groups, as well as the enemy carrier-based aircraft groups' sudden attacks on Japanese airfields, are also sufficient to show the subtle dynamics between them.</p>
<p>Enemy's Supply Difficulties</p>
<p>Enemy America landed four divisions on Okinawa Island. Calculating at nine tons per person, 500,000 tons of supply ships per month is absolutely the minimum required, and they should not miss the good opportunity. Currently, the situation of the decisive battle of Okinawa is similar to the Battle of Leyte. Due to the precious sacrifices of the special underwater attack units, battleships, etc., and the desperate efforts of the land, sea, and air forces, the enemy's powerful mobile force has been mostly destroyed. Today's situation is exactly the same as the opportunity to change the war situation created when the Kaoru and Takachiho units forcibly landed. Can this good opportunity be seized? The success or failure of the decisive battle of Okinawa depends on the size of the war power recently injected, that is, the number of aircraft.</p>
<p>Supplies from Manila to Leyte often did not arrive en route. Moreover, the distance of its supply is farther than to the Mariana or Leyte Islands, and it is constantly threatened by Japanese submarines along the way. At the same time, Japanese kamikaze special attack planes and special underwater attack units are gathering around Okinawa, waiting for opportunities to launch fierce attacks. The enemy's mobile force has been greatly damaged in order to protect its friendly forces. As a result, it has only been able to rely on specially equipped aircraft carriers for escort, but recently, in the war results announced by the Japanese army, the number of specially equipped aircraft carriers sunk or destroyed is considerable. The enemy's troops on Okinawa Island will eventually become hostages, and Enemy America will regret it! For Japan, Enemy America's four divisions will become a tempting bait to lure out all enemy ships.</p>
<p>So far, no major movements have been seen on the Okinawa front. The Japanese army is either luring the enemy into an ambush and annihilating them in one fell swoop, or breaking through the center of the enemy's line in one breath with the main force, seizing the initiative of ground combat, and rapidly launching ghostly hand-to-hand combat, achieving the amazing results announced by the Imperial Headquarters. The enemy also knows that future losses will inevitably increase.</p>
<p>The Japanese army's ground units have fully prepared food and ammunition, and are supported by hundreds of thousands of Okinawa residents, with high morale and soaring ambition. Although the battlefield has expanded from north of Nago to in front of Shuri, there are fierce Japanese melee troops everywhere. The 5,000 enemy troops who landed in the Nago area cannot move due to the heavy pressure from the Japanese army, and countless enemy bodies are abandoned in front of the main Japanese army positions in the south. Since the night of April 12th, the Japanese army has launched a simultaneous offensive from the northern Shuri area, fiercely attacking the enemy troops who are constructing defensive positions. Taking advantage of the chaos in their lines, they sent a large number of melee troops to infiltrate their ranks, disrupting their interior and achieving great results.</p>
<p>Dilemma</p>
<p>Enemy America's common tactic for attacking islands in the ocean is to launch continuous fierce attacks with all its strength. For example, in the past in the Saipan and Iwo Jima areas, they used ships to encircle them on all sides, supplemented by fierce naval gun bombardment. However, the attack on Okinawa Island is more moderate than in the past. This is because the enemy army has suffered deeply from the continuous attacks by the Japanese land and sea special attack units. Before the start of the Okinawa Island operation, Enemy America gathered an estimated seven divisions of troops from Leyte to Ioroshima and Saipan, of which four divisions had already landed on Okinawa. Afterwards, in preparation for the next operation, Enemy America again mobilized troops domestically. So far, in the first line of Saipan and Leyte, their accumulated strength is estimated to be nearly ten divisions. However, although they knew that they could not advance and attack Okinawa with the strength of four divisions alone, they still could not send reinforcements. What is the reason for this? There is no other reason than the strict surveillance of the Japanese special attack units, which makes it impossible for them to act rashly.</p>
<p>The mobile force has suffered heavy blows, and the four divisions that have already landed cannot be abandoned. They must continue to find ways to supply them, at great risk, under the fierce attacks of the Japanese special attack units. This is Enemy America's greatest suffering. In order to break through this dilemma, they must acquire an air base on Okinawa Island and gather land-based aircraft to prevent the counterattack of the Japanese special attack aircraft. The reason why Enemy America is desperately repairing the airfields they have already obtained in that area today, and is thirsting to seize new airfields, is for this reason.

<h3>Facing the Harsh Reality, Not Entertaining Illusions</h3>
<p>Doenitz Broadcasts to the Germans</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) Grand Admiral Dönitz broadcast to the Germans yesterday from the Flensburg radio station, saying: "We must endure the harsh facts of the current situation. In my first speech on May 1st, I stated that my job was to save the lives of the Germans, but I dare not guarantee that I will ultimately be able to help you. The National Socialist Party no longer exists. From now on, there will be no more party-state unity. The foundation of Germany's previous nation-building has now disappeared. During the period of occupation in Germany, power was transferred to the occupying forces. Whether I and the government I appointed can perform our duties depends entirely on their decisions. The war ended one hour before midnight on May 8th, and the German army has stepped onto the road to being captured. This is the final sacrifice for the lives of German women and children and the future of Germany. We express our respect for the heroism that we have shown to them thousands of times. We pledge to never forget the dead and the captured. I promise the Germans that, within the scope of my authority, I will give them possible living conditions, but during this difficult period, I still do not know what I should do to help you. But we should face the facts and not entertain illusions. If my continued tenure is helpful to the motherland, I will do so until the Germans have the opportunity to express their will to appoint a new head of state, or until the occupying authorities make it impossible for me to continue in office. The Germans have a difficult future, and we must move forward with dignity. We should have the will to work hard. If we lack this will, there is no basis for future life. I am determined to stand side by side with the Germans. If my responsibility requires me to remain in office, then I will take steps to retire with the heart of serving Germany and the Germans."</p>

<h3>Issuing Gold Certificates Helps Suppress Price Levels; Central Reserve Bank's Kimura Kobun Issues Statement</h3>
<p>After the Central Reserve Bank issued gold certificates, Dr. Kimura Sotaro, advisor to the bank, specially answered questions on the nature of the country's currency inflation, future trends, and the significance of issuing gold certificates in the Japanese-language Continental News. It is translated and published below:</p>
<h3>Inflation Is Absolutely Not Malignant</h3>
<p>(Question) Currently, all countries around the world are in a state of war, and they all have a tendency towards inflation. What is your view on inflation in our country?</p>
<p>(Answer) Although there is a tendency towards inflation in the Central China area, its progress and depth, compared with other countries, is still in a very preliminary stage of inflation. In short, it is not malignant, and it will absolutely not lead to malignant inflation. There are two reasons for this: one is based on the ancient history of China, and the other is based on China's current economic strength. China issued paper money as early as a thousand years ago, and was originally the world's oldest country to use paper currency. It has experience in the excessive issuance of paper money many times throughout its history. Paper money was already issued during the Tang and Song dynasties. Although malignant inflation occurred during the Yuan dynasty due to the excessive issuance of paper money, the economic problem was the biggest reason why the Yuan dynasty's military achievements did not last for ten generations and eventually collapsed in less than seventy or eighty years. There were also many examples of this in the Ming dynasty. In the early Qing dynasty, although restrictions were placed on the issuance of paper money, excessive issuance of paper money reappeared during the Zhengde era. With this long history of experience, the Chinese people already know how to protect themselves against inflation, and have unknowingly cultivated a great power. Furthermore, from the current situation, China is one of the world's leading countries in terms of material wealth, and we absolutely do not believe that economic bankruptcy will occur due to inflation. If we compare China's current situation with the inflation during the First European War, the situation in Germany in the autumn of 1922 was quite similar to the situation in Central China in the autumn of last year. However, in May 1923, the inflation in Germany progressed extremely rapidly. In May of this year, the situation in Central China was not as dramatically changed as in Germany. The price of goods in Central China has been high for seven years now, while Germany only experienced a short period of four years before its inflation fell into extreme deterioration. The situation in China is not like this. However, if we therefore think that we can be indifferent to studying countermeasures against inflation, or even be complacent and take it as optimistic, then that would be a grave mistake.</p>
<h3>Gold Certificates and Countermeasures Against Price Increases</h3>
<p>(Question) What is the relationship between issuing gold certificates and countermeasures against price increases? (Answer) Recently, due to the evolution of the war situation and other various factors, the form of price fluctuations has greatly changed. In January of this year, public concern was focused on goods, but now it is focused on some speculative commodities, especially gold bars. The speed of general price increases is actually slower compared to last year. Even if this trend is artificially induced, it will not cause much hindrance. Of course, the impact of the rise in gold bars on general prices cannot be ignored, but judging from the recent trend of price increases, it has indeed slowed down. It is ideal to simultaneously suppress both the price of gold and the price of other goods, but it is very difficult to suppress all prices. The original purpose of selling gold certificates was to recover paper money and reduce the amount of paper money in circulation, which is to suppress prices. The price of gold bars has always been prone to skyrocketing, and this issuance of gold certificates is to regulate it. It can be said to be an appropriate measure for the current situation.</p>
<p>(Question) Where is the gold held by the Gold Certificate Issuance Reserve Management Committee stored?</p>
<p>(Answer) After the gold certificates are sold, the gold will be transferred to the management committee and stored within the former Joint Reserve Committee of Silver Firms to reassure the people to purchase them.</p>
<p>(Question) Why are gold certificates divided into one-tael, five-tael, and ten-tael denominations?</p>
<p>(Answer) There is no special meaning. It is only to facilitate general purchases.</p>
<p>(Question) Why is the sales period limited to only three days? Is it too short?</p>
<p>(Answer) This is only the first sale. There will be continued sales in the future. Although the period is short, there is nothing to worry about. If the time is extended, the daily selling price must be changed at any time. A fixed three-day period ensures that there can be a uniform selling price for at least three days without having to change it at any time.</p>
<h3>The Black Market for Gold Bars May Become Clear</h3>
<p>(Question) Will gold certificates be publicly listed?</p>
<p>(Answer) They will be listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange within two or three days, and powerful individuals will be designated as brokers. Using the selling price of gold certificates to regulate the gold market, the long-term black market for gold bars should soon become clear. If gold certificates can circulate sufficiently, it is deeply believed that they will have a very good impact on resisting price increases. As for countermeasures against inflation, all countries in the world have experience. Although they have been explored from various angles, ultimately, the first priority is to recover the currency that has flowed out. Whether it is increasing taxes, encouraging savings, or issuing public bonds, the purpose is to recover currency. The purpose of issuing gold certificates this time is also the same. We firmly believe that it will have a considerable positive effect on improving prices in China, especially in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>The First Phase of Gold Certificates - Merchants and the Public Are Eager to Purchase - 5,000 Taels Sold on the Last Day</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank began selling the first phase of gold certificates from the 7th to the 9th of this month. Various silver firms and citizens in the city went to the bank to purchase them very enthusiastically. The 9th was the last day of the first phase of sales, and the purchasers were even more crowded. The number of sales reached approximately 5,000 taels, more than double the number of sales on the 7th and 8th, which shows the faith of merchants and the public in gold certificates. This is because the Central Reserve Bank's issuance of gold certificates this time is backed by a full amount of gold reserves, and a management committee composed of powerful officials and civilians has been established to be responsible for management. Gold can be redeemed at any time one month after the issuance period. At the same time, the public is allowed to establish a market for free trading. This kind of liquid investment path is what merchants and the public are happy to buy. It is reported that the bank will deliver the number of gold certificates sold on the 7th, 8th, and 9th and the full amount of reserve gold to the Issuance Reserve Management Committee for safekeeping, so that they can be redeemed when they mature on June 8th.</p>

<h3>Yesterday Was the 17th Anti-Aircraft Day - Various Drills Were Held - Strict Traffic and Lighting Controls Were Implemented</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 9th) was the 17th Anti-Aircraft Day. The Municipal Civil Defense Headquarters, as usual, expanded the publicity of the significance of air defense and implemented various air defense drills. The whole day was in a state of air defense, and the atmosphere was extremely tense. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Alarm Drill</p>
<p>This temporary alarm drill did not sound the alarm, but implemented various telegraphic communication drills such as commands and flag displays. At 10:00 a.m., a drill was conducted to issue a warning alarm. At 10:30 a.m., a drill was conducted to issue an air raid alarm. The copper drums that transmitted the alarm rang throughout the city, and small red flags waved in various districts. All police and Baojia personnel were dispatched to strictly enforce traffic control. Except for vehicles with the "Emergency" sign, all military vehicles were prohibited from passing and were parked on the side of the road. Those who were unlucky were allowed to drive on the left side of the street after stopping for ten minutes. At 11:00 a.m., a drill was conducted to lift the air raid alarm, and vehicles resumed driving. At 12:00 noon, a drill was conducted to lift the warning alarm. At 2:00 p.m., a drill was conducted to issue a warning alarm. At 4:00 p.m., a drill was conducted to lift the warning alarm. At 8:00 p.m., a drill was conducted to issue a warning alarm again. Baojia personnel from various districts were dispatched to check unshielded lights and implement warning light control. At 9:00 p.m., a drill was conducted to issue an air raid alarm. Xiao Benzhenyilang, the section chief of the Air Defense Section of the Police Bureau, Deputy Section Chief Li Zhensheng, Traffic Section Chief Shan Tong, Deputy Section Chief Qingmu and others personally led police officers to carry out strict traffic and lighting controls together with all police officers and Baojia personnel of the second division of various sub-bureaus. Unshielded lights were also completely extinguished, and the entire city was in a state of darkness. All entertainment venues stopped music and performances. Police officers and Baojia personnel patrolled the streets. If any light leakage was found, the house number would be recorded and the power would be cut off. They also checked vehicle lights, and if there were any violations, they would be taken to the police station for processing. At 10:00 p.m., a drill was conducted to lift the air raid alarm. At 11:00 p.m., a drill was conducted to lift the warning alarm, and the entire city was restored to brightness.</p>
<p>In addition, when various alarms were issued, various districts designated locations to carry out comprehensive drills. Factories and buildings carried out indoor and outdoor air defense drills, and the Baojia authorities in various districts checked air defense equipment and organized necessary supplies such as air raid shelters and air defense wells.</p>
<p>Local Drill</p>
<p>This comprehensive drill in the local area was held in the areas under the jurisdiction of the Jing'an Temple, Jiangning Road, and Putuo Road sub-bureaus. The three sub-bureaus designated appropriate locations yesterday, including 13 locations in Jing'an Temple, 3 locations in Jiangning Road, and 25 locations in Putuo Road, to carry out comprehensive drills such as evacuation, firefighting, rescue, and alarm transmission from 10:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. The Air Defense Headquarters and the Police Headquarters sent personnel to the site to inspect. Yao Ruifeng, Shou Yuan, and Dou Zhihai, the heads of the respective sub-bureaus, together with the heads of various sections, served as commanders and dispatched all Baojia air defense personnel in various districts to participate in the exercises. Citizens also participated, so the entire area of the three districts was filled with smoke and fire, and the sound of firecrackers echoed in the sky, creating a realistic situation.</p>
<p>Civil Defense Drill</p>
<p>In addition, the Huangpu and Laoza districts conducted comprehensive drills on alarm transmission, evacuation, fire prevention, rescue, and other aspects of air defense at the junction of the two districts on Shaanxi Road from 2:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m., with citizens participating in the exercises. Each shop on the street dispatched three people, who were guided by police chiefs and Baojia personnel. The two sub-bureau chiefs, Xiao Lin and Xu Zhengshou, and deputy sub-bureau chiefs Liu Yaying and Yi Zhongda, together with Shen Hua and other section chiefs, served as commanders. The Air Defense Headquarters also sent personnel to the site to inspect. This was a thorough civil defense drill, so the exercises were carried out very seriously.</p>

<h3>Chinese Health Association Stipulates</h3>
<p>Free Artificial Pneumothorax Method</p>
<p>The White Light Lady's concert held at the Lyceum Theater on the 5th of this month was hosted by the Shanghai Concert Association. The income, after deducting expenses, will all be allocated to the Anti-Tuberculosis Fund of the Chinese Health Association. It is estimated that the total income will reach at least 5 million yuan. Part of the honorary tickets from the first show, totaling 3.48 million yuan, has been allocated by the concert to the Chinese Health Association, and it has been requested that the association first organize free artificial pneumothorax treatment. The number of people is set at 100, and each person will be allocated 50,000 yuan as annual treatment expenses. The application methods are as follows:</p>
<p>All: (A) students, teachers, and education professionals, (B) employees of companies and workers of factories, are eligible to apply. All applicants must have an X-ray proof from a doctor or hospital, and only those who are suitable for artificial pneumothorax treatment will be considered temporarily. Serious illnesses are not included in this example. Treatment must last at least one year and must not be interrupted without reason. No fees will be charged during this period. Applications can be made through the Social Services Department of this newspaper.</p>
<p>In this extraordinary period, tuberculosis is rampant, which is truly alarming, and all sectors have a deep understanding of the importance of eradicating tuberculosis. This further implementation of treatment by the Health Association is of great benefit to public health. The association, in addition to expressing its deep gratitude to the ticket purchasers of the concert, also has unpaid donations for purchased goods. Please send them directly to the association at 996 Jing'an Temple Road to conclude the matter. Every 50,000 yuan can save one person from tuberculosis, which is particularly meaningful.</p>
