<h3>第三屆海軍節　昨隆重舉行紀念　陳代主席親臨作懇切訓示</h3>
<p>南京一日中央社電　一日爲我國第三海軍節，値國府還都五週年之後二日，回顧國府於還都以後，雖瘡痍滿目，環境艱難，而對於新海軍之建設積極進行，刻已規模組具，發展可期，際此總力決戰之時，逢此在我國海軍重建史上具有深長意義之海軍節，實覺無限感奮。海軍部特於昨日上午九時在該部大禮堂，由凌部長領導該都所屬南京要港司令部等全體官員數百人，舉行隆重之紀念儀式。陳代主席並親臨賜訓，闡明國府重建海軍之決意，謂人才首重精神敎育，語極懇擊，各官員恭聆之下，咸極感　。下午七時凌海長並在國際俱樂部宴待盟邦海軍高級長官以資聯歡。</p>
<h3>凌部長廣播演講闡明海軍節意義</h3>
<p>南京一日中央社電海軍部長凌靑氏以「海軍節之意義」爲題，特於士對於海軍有信切的認識，再進而對於海溯之重要有明確的了解，以國人對於海洋觀念談薄，因而對於海軍亦若無關輕重。</p>
<p>重陸輕海觀念由來</p>
<p>按諸史冊，我中華民族自黃帝建國以來，其發展途徑爲治黃河流城自西而東，一周秦而後逐漸南移，歷漢唐宋明以迄近代，遂蕃析生息於長江珠江兩大流域而奄有今日之遼關版圖，以歷史上之發展，係自西而東由北而南之故，歷代邊患均在西北兩方，乃養成國人重陸輕海之觀念。迨至遷淸末季，歐人東侵，鴉片中法各役喪地賠款，有識之士漸覺海疆防務之重要，遺逾於西北邊防，故當時曾李諸先賢，力排衆義創設海軍，甲午而後，國人對於海軍之重要性又復漠然。民國　造，國事紛紜，及國府定都南京，言國防者竟有應棄海軍，專事空軍建設之謬論，國人不察，一倡百和，此無異因噎廢食，斷臂求健。</p>
<p>老成謀國海軍重建</p>
<p>當此時地·我主席陳先生適日職中樞，曾著論以關其非，可謂老成謀國，獨具隻眼，我國海軍之所以得獲一脈茍延者，賴有此耳。民國二十九年國府還都，當局教然努力於新海軍之建設，爲使國人眞正認識海軍對於現代國家之重要起見，特於三十二年明令規定四月一日爲海軍節，其意義至爲深長，不惟用以鼓舞新海軍人員，使其淬勵奮發，克以負荷重大任務，且使國人觀感之一下　　海軍之重要，而有以倡導襲助，俾得日益發揚光大。去年第二届海軍節，京滬粤漢等地凡有本部所屬機關駐在處所，均曾熱烈隆重舉行慶祝，全國人士亦耳目一新，咸知我國新海軍之建設，已規模粗備，由此推進則全國海防當可日趨鞏固，一變以往門戶洞開之弊，甚盛事也。</p>
<p>務盡職責協助盟邦</p>
<p>今年四月一日第三屆海軍節又臨，適値太平洋戰爭緊張，大東亞解放聖戰已到決勝階段，海軍關乎戰局一之演進尤爲明顯。盟邦日本因擁有强大之聯合艦隊，故能有恃無恐，以逸待勞，靜待最有利之時機，一舉而擊破敵人殲滅敵人，而收獲最後勝利。當此嚴重時期，凡我海軍袍澤應如何亦步亦趨協助盟邦，勿稍放棄其職責，凡我國人應如何對於海軍有更進一步之認識督促倡導，使我海軍之前途日趨光大，此實本届海軍節所　求者。本人忝長海部，謹當秉承國策，督率部屬，將預定新海軍之各項建設計劃逐步推進。而今人力物力固屬極端困難，然在盟邦盡力協助與指導之下，苟能以鍥而不舍之精神赴事，必有竟其全功之時，願全國人士推其愛護國家之心以愛護海軍，不辭促導從旁贊助，則海軍復興實利賴之。</p>
<h3>席捲豫省平原　日軍佔南陽　同時突入老河口機塲</h3>
<p>河南前綫日軍基地一日中央社電　席捲河南平原，續續進攻之華北方面日軍精銳，突破方城耳河之渝第二集團軍第六軍抵抗錢後，二十七日黎明，迫近駐渝美空軍之前進據點南陽邊外，與自南昭南下之快速部隊協力，一十七日拂曉，一齊進攻渝軍據守去年慘淡構築之重砲陣地及山砲陣地等成爲要塞化防衛陣地，圖作最後之抵抗，然日軍精銳於東北關開一角突入路，至同日正午將南陽完全佔領</p>
<p>河南前綫二十一日中央社電　駐渝美空軍爲策應美空軍之急於對日空襲，刻正謀積極推進基地，華北日軍各精銳部隊，對於進窺平漢路沿綫之道慶嫡系胡宗南部下第一戰區軍以及劉崎部下第五戰區軍，樂已有充分準備，三月二十二日與華中日軍互相呼應，突自平漢沿錢西側地區分成數縱隊，同時開能行動，向西南進擊。二十七日遂突入老河口飛機塲，予以完全佔領，綠伏牛山脈北麓之日軍部隊，爲驅逐據守山中陣地抵抗之第三十九集團軍長高樹勳部下新編第六，第八兩師，於二十五日陷南台（鄭州西南一百公里），別動坦克車部隊，於二十四日在方城附近擊潰第五戰區暫編第三十六師，快速部隊更於二十三日驅走第五戰區第五十五軍曹福林所率第八十一，七十四，二十九等三師。日軍於攻陷泌陽）鄭州西南二百二十公里）後，一氣尾追殘敵，突破第二十二集團軍第四十一軍）軍長孫震）防地，二十七日拂曉，衝人駐渝美空軍前進基地湖北省老河口飛機塲，展開壯烈激戰，本日下午予以完全佔領，現正繼續猛攻該城。</p>
<h3>島田中佐　分述戰況</h3>
<p>南京一日中央社電　日派遺軍報道部島田中佐，三十一日下午五時，於日本記者俱樂部接見中國記者，說明老河口戰役及冲繩島方面戰况如次：</p>
<p>老河口戰役</p>
<p>自贛州遂川戰役之後，渝美空軍之前綫基地僅存老河口一處，按老河口爲渝美西北空軍基地軍（包括西安·漢口·安康等地）之最前方基地，河南戰後，渝美西北空軍之主要工作，在破壞平漢。津浦及揚子江西游等重要交通綫及交通設施，今其前進基地老河口機塲旣被攻陷，渝美西北空軍基地羣所遭打擊實大。按該戰區渝軍兵力有十七八師之衆，防守老河口者，爲劉峙之軍隊，南陽方面爲第二師，鎭平方面爲第三十九師，該地區渝軍自河南戰後，即積極改編，期恢復實力，老河口一役開始時，一部日軍由魯山·葉縣·舞陽·遂平等地出動，以南陽爲目標，向前推進，另一部日軍則與此相呼應，由荊門與漢水向襄陽老河口進攻。三月二十七日，渝軍不支潰退敗走西岸·浙川·老河口一綫，後退二百五十軍，一部監視南陽，一部向新野進攻，其快速部隊於二十七日正午突入老河口飛機塲，該地渝美空軍已早於二十五日晚向安康方面進雲，日軍佔領老河口機塲後，渝美西北空軍基地安康·漢中·西安三地，距離老河口約八百公里，老河口機塲之被佔，意義至爲重大，綜合可分下列一二點：　渝美空軍進入內地後，去其活動目標地更遠。　渝美西北空軍基地羣，爲B29型機基地之外圍防地，老河口爲其外圍基地之前衝，故老河口機塲之喪失，間接可威脅B29型之活動。　太平洋菲律賓及冲繩方面，敵B29型機之活動，仍賴中國大陸方面戰鬥機之護傳，今美空軍大睦前進基地喪失，東方各地B29之活動，亦受相當打擊。再者，日來空襲南京之敵機，多爲由老河口起飛之戰鬥機，老河口之喪失，敵機對南京空襲，亦將無形減少。</p>
<p>冲繩島方面</p>
<p>沖繩島方面之戰爭，現正於慶良間列島方面展開，同時敵軍正對冲繩島南部加以艦砲射擊。敵軍此種戰術與過去塞班島作戰略同，企圖藉此掩靂登陸，敵軍圖犯慶良間列島，先行登陸者，按理推測，不外欲求得一進攻冲繩島之跳板耳。於此跳板上設置艦船碇泊地，補給地及軍醫院等，一俟此種準備工作完備後，再進攻冲繩島。按敵軍進攻塞班時，乃以空軍作爲登陸之跳板，今進攻冲繩，則以陸地基地為作跳板，此實因敵軍於塞班作戰損失過大而得來之經驗也。慶良間列島，距沖繩島僅十餘里，於此狹小海上，實難容龐大艦隊之活動，故敵軍將其艦隊分爲數團，於冲繩島南半部三方海面，實施艦砲射擊，便敵艦久恐日軍特攻隊之攻擊，故其活動僅限於白畫（白畫於艦隊上空可以飛機作嚴密之警戒，夜間警戒則不同），冲繩海城敵艦勢力爲百艘左右，而迄今已損失達五分之一或至半數，敵軍雖遭此損失，然於太平洋上仍擁有龐大之海軍力，日軍於冲繩之北有九州，冲繩之南有台灣兩大空軍基地，隨時可出動大隊空軍，實施攻擊硫黃島作戰，敵軍損失全兵力半數以上，冲繩島作戰，敵軍之損失定將更大，故今後日軍之成要，頗堪注目。</p>

<h3>任援道省長談蘇省治安財政</h3>
<p>— 湯毅</p>
<p>「江蘇省的治安，無所謂好壞，擔實際情珍，記不如外間傳說的那樣，這是可以肯定說的。一個地方的治安壞，我們可以立刻使他變好，但是軍隊一調防，又恢復了原狀。」當記者與任省長討論上海疏散人口問題，談到改善治安時，任省長這樣說明。</p>
<p>「要恢復事變前的治安狀態，問題很簡單，便是結束事變。因為有了事變，就產生了兩種思想，目前無疑需要和平，然而抗戰論者卻又　圓其說。壞的是一部份狡黠之徒，以此為藉口，來圖一巴的私利；有武器的掛起抗戰的照牌，無武器的也有借此岡利的辦法，甚至有些保甲長，希望治安不好，故意張大其詞，以便混水摸魚。聽的人不明眞相，一傳十，十傳百，以爲情形怎樣嚴重。</p>
<p>「要消滅這種狀態，不是沒有辦法，祇要殺，然而自從維新政府起，我一向執着軍權，除了戰塲上不幸遭遇外，可說我從來沒有殺過一人，如果大肆殺戮，固然可使治安立刻改善，但一般是同胞，沒有自相殘殺的道理。其次，如果政府的財政充裕，可以養大量的兵，也可以從事鎭壓。再不然，有許多職位，安插收撫這些掛着抗戰照牌的人，也可以解決這問題，但事實上都是不許可的。</p>
<p>「如果事變那一天結束，消滅了歧異的思想，狡黠之徒無所藉口，治安那一天即可恢復原狀。」任省長談到這裏，臉上堆着微笑，似乎充滿了自信。</p>
<p>記者說：「提高公務員的待遇也是個重要問題。」</p>
<p>任省長說：「是的，軍風紀的維持，從政人員工作效率之增加，祗有一條路，便是提高待遇。</p>
<p>「但是，我們不能祇顧提高待遇，忽略了人民的負擔，要在不增加人民負擔的原則下，增加財政收入以提高公務員待遇，是非常困難的事。</p>
<p>「當然，另外也有方法，譬如整現稅收，過去半年來整理稅收，剔除中飽的結果，增收了十萬萬元，這巳是很大的數目，然而用在增加公務員半年待遇上，每月不過攤到一萬萬多。實際上我們已經提高過全省公務員軍警敎員的待遇，僅僅提高一點，每月便要多支出三萬萬元。但物價的昇漲尙無遏制的辦法，我們一方面要　到人民負担，一方面又要充裕財源以保證公務員最低限度的生活，這個工作是十分艱巨的，然而我有這決心，希望所有公務員安心供戰。」</p>
<p>記者最後提起任省長在滬說的修築三條滬蘇公路的話，任省長說：「早已動工了，人工方面，因爲各縣分別負責境內的工程，並無困難，倒是二十萬萬元的修築經費，正有待於籌措呢！」</p>
<h3>德東南邊境　蘇展開攻勢　維也納爲最後目標</h3>
<p>柏林一日中央社電　海通社訊：德國東南邊區過去三日因蘇軍之新攻勢，已成爲東綫戰事重心，目前蘇軍向該處進犯之目的有二，一向西進，但最近並無任何進展，一向北進，以紐斯達特為目標，蘇軍先鋒隊刻已在斯坦那變格與戈恩斯間衝過德邊境，轉向北進，現已進抵拉勃·奧登堡鐵路綫，蘇軍在多瑙河迤北向西推進之部隊，今已受阻於紐特拉與華格兩河間之德軍防地前，即在紐霍塞爾·柯莫恩迤西區內，故蘇軍在格拉茲·維也納·與普來斯堡方面已形成　形進展，倘蘇軍仍以維也納爲最後目標，則在數週內當將展開激戰。</p>
<p>西里西亞戰事緊張</p>
<p>柏林一日中央社電　德國社訊：上西里西亞之大戰漸趨緊張，洛斯勞之蘇軍攻擊雖已崩潰，但在拉的波爾之西，蘇軍以强大坦克部隊協助時攻，曾深度突入德軍陣綫，但其後即被德軍堵塞。</p>
<h3>西綫戰況</h3>
<p>柏林三十一日中央社電　西綫戰事因美第一第三丙軍之急速進擊，故反軸心軍已將北方之巴達龐（Paderborn）至南方之法蘭克福以東之萊因中部地區予以控制。</p>
<h3>王蔭泰氏在京　向全國廣播</h3>
<p>「還都紀念和完成和平統一」</p>
<p>南京一日中央社電　華北政務委員會委員長王蔭泰，三十一日晚假中央廣播電台，以「還都紀念和完成和平統一」為題，向全國民衆廣播略謂：</p>
<p>我首先說的話，華北政務委員會，是國民政府所屬的地方行政機關，北方民衆，對於團結一致，復興祖國的信念的要求，兄弟可以代表全體，在此說明這一點中心信念。</p>
<p>自力復興</p>
<p>北方的同胞和南方的同胞，完全一致，絕對相同，就全面來說，目前的國粗，雖然四分五裂，但是無論那方面的同胞，都心心念念企待和平統一的到來，對於救國家，救民族的目的，無論那方面的同胞，本來是一致的。中國需要自力復興，完全用自已的力量，提高了國家民族的地位，然後才能和以平等待我的國家民族互相提携，那麼，只要問一問我們有沒有誠意，有沒有決心，也可以說只要具有這樣的誠意的決心，無論何等的艱難阻礙，都不難在堅忍勇毅的進行行列中一一加以摧破。</p>
<p>培養民生</p>
<p>其次，想說一說對於民意問題的感想，這一次，中央在還都紀念興奮的心情前來參加，前天的會議，一定可以得到了很珍貴創始性的收穫，我們應當一面以誠心要求同胞的協力，一面本着陳代主席整飭官常的決心，認淸「賢人政治」，或者說：治人的問題，是非常時的所切實需要的，認淸只有培養民生，方能增強國力，方能達成內求統一，外求解放的使命。</p>
<p>勉勵將來</p>
<p>我們應忠誠坦白地檢以往，勉勵將來，由於尊重民意，走到實現民意，積極地來把政府建立在人民之上。</p>
<h3>敵機襲九州</h3>
<p>東京一日中央社電　焉里亞納之敵B29型機一百數十架，三月三十一日上午十時至下午三時，來襲九州方面之飛機塲及航空設施等，企圖與冲繩本島登陸軍互相呼應，今後B29型機之對九州方面空襲，將更趨激烈。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>論琉球戰局</h3>
<p>最近敵美繼硫黃島作戰之後，又在琉球羣島中冲繩方面企圖登陸作戰。琉球羣島即南西羣島，最大島嶼爲冲繩，其首府那霸，距離日、本九州之鹿兒島四五〇公里，距台灣之合北五一〇公里，距我國寗波溫州各爲五四〇公里，距本市六五〇公里。戰局前途之趨向，値得我們嚴密注視；同時，敵美又展開謀略攻勢，製造種抓謠言，以圖感亂人心。我們處此局勢之下，尤應鎭靜而不爲謠言所惑。</p>
<p>敵美向琉球羣島展開攻勢之目的，可分兩方面觀察：第一，在政治謀略方面，預定於四月二十五日舉行的舊金山會議中，敵美爲取得發言權的優勢，以達到將來制霸遠東的野心，當然要視其對東亞作戰實况而定，如果不能在會議以前取得所謂「作戰的優勢」，那麼會議上不免爲蘇聯及其他國家所質詢，所以，敵美不能不巡行更大的軍事冒險。第二，在戰略方而，主要在於奪取堅强的空軍基地，以加强破壞盟邦日本戰時生產的戰略轟炸，同時並擬以冲　島爲中心，加强其　五百至一千公里內的中日滿及南洋各地交通連絡的破壞。</p>
<p>然則，敵美這種目的有無達成的希望呢？我們在未作斷論之前，必須認淸，敵人要達到這次政戰兩略的目的，最王要的條件是：　速戰速決：如果在四月二十五日以前達不到目的，那時團際戰局及外交形勢轉變，，敵美將不得不自認失敗；　雄厚的接濟力：如果辦不到的話，其主動艦隊將不免被日軍吸住及消耗，主客的地位一轉移，也不能不陷於失敗；　友軍的牽制，使日軍不能從別處調用兵力，反須分兵到別處；否則，孤軍深入的敵美主攻部隊，仍不免於重大犧牲，而達不到此次政略戰略的目的。</p>
<p>今日敵美是否具備　三個必要條件呢？第一，就友軍牽制一點而言，美國在太平洋上兵力的分散，觀於敵美反攻占領各島間距離之遼即可瞭然，敵軍相互間呼應作戰的困難性，今後勢必更將增加。至於敵英軍隊，什麼對蘇門答臘攻勢，對馬來半島反攻，甚至對印度支那半島雷州半島登陸，都只是無稽的謠傳，印度殖民地自顧不暇，幾百架飛機的空襲對戰局不會發生多大作用。其次，所謂「重慶反攻」的對美呼應更不可恃，渝共問題迄尙僵持。由此可知敵美對於這一條件並不具備，反之，日軍在中國方面發動河南攻勢，攻佔南陽並突入老河口及長汀空襲，在太平洋方面對西部新幾內亞的主攻，更收到了反牽制作戰的效果。</p>
<p>第二，敵美在去年法北登陸作戰動用了十二萬四千的兵力，三千四百艘大小艦艇；過去菲律賓登陸，動用了二十七萬餘兵力，一千多艘艦艇；硫黃島作戰動用了二十二萬兵力，八百多艘大小艦艇；現在琉球羣島之戰，其動用兵力與艦艇之多，尤可想見；而各方攻佔區又必須大量兵力加以維持，那麼，雄厚的接濟大這個條件又不具備。</p>
<p>第三，由於上述兩大條件不能具備，當然「速戰速決」這個條件更加談不上了。囚此，他們不能不另用謀略宣傳，製造種種謠言想動搖東亞軸心國的人心，以圖促成速戰述決的條件。</p>
<p>所以，我們必須指出：敵美對琉球羣島的攻勢，並未具備成功的任何條件，但從敵人政戰二略及新戰區的地理形勢觀察，中國大陸登陸作戰的危機，和對日本本土侵攻同探嚴重，三月二十六日重慶國民公報也曾宣稱：「最近軍事上諸進展，今後對日作戰即將在中國大陸展開」，也是我們所不能忽視的。我們必須用一切力量反對中國大陸的戰塲化，對於」切敵性謠傳，斷然予以肅淸，大家以冷靜的頭腦，必勝的決心，沉着準備未來的決戰。</p>
<h3>琉球方面敵艦船被擊沉毀百餘艘　冲繩本島南部敵昨上陸</h3>
<p>東京一日中央社電　日大本營一日下午三時發表：　冲繩本島周邊之敵，三月三十一日晨，以其一部兵力於神山島及前島登陸。四月一日晨，又以主力部隊於冲繩本島南部地區開始登陸。　日航空部隊及水上部隊，攻擊敵艦船，所獲之戰果中，其後業已判明者如次：擊沉航空母艦一艘，巡洋艦二艘，驅逐艦二艘，艦型不詳者三艘，擊沉或擊毀戰艦或巡洋艦一艘，擊毀戰艦或巡洋艦一艘，驅逐艦二艘，艦型不詳者一艘，輸送船一艘，</p>
<p>東京一日中央社電　一日上午七時二十分頃，敵軍於冲繩本島南部上陸，將主力分為兩部，其一部首以上陸用大型舟艇三十艘，小型舟艇七十艘，結爲一羣，由凑川西南四公里附近開始上陸，另一部則以上陸用大型舟艇百五十艘，小型舟艇六十艘結爲一羣，企圖於北谷及嘉手納之正面上陸，日軍現正對之加以猛攻中。</p>
<p>東京一日中央社電　日航空部隊及水上部隊，自三月二十三日敵機動部隊出現於琉球羣島以來，所獲之邀　戰略中，現在業經判明者如　：擊沉五十九艘，擊沉或擊毀六艘，擊毀四十艘，計共達百〇五艘，其內容如次：</p>
<p>擊沉：航空母艦二艘，大型艦五艘，巡洋艦十二艘，巡洋艦或驅逐艦一艘，驅逐艦十五艘，掃海艇一艘，艦型為詳者十九艘。</p>
<p>擊沉或擊毀：戰艦或巡洋艦一艘，大型艦五艘。</p>
<p>擊毀：戰艦一艘，戰艦或巡洋艦十一艘，巡洋艦一艘，驅逐艦十艘，輸送船四艘，艦型不詳者十三艘。</p>
<p>東京一日中央社電　敵機動部隊連日以百架乃至五百架之艦載機，反裏向冲繩本島及其周邊各地區施行轟炸及機槍掃射，同時，加以艦砲射擊達數千發。三十一日於神山及前島登陸之敵軍，立即於該島構築重砲陣地，並備有重砲四尊，今已開始試射。日軍航空部隊及水上部隊，連日來反復强烈攻擊敵艦船，據一日日大一本營之發表，已獲得擊沉或擊毀合計已達一百零五艘業經判明之戰果，至於實際之戰果，將較此更大，此實無庸贅言。但該海域今仍有以戰艦十數艘爲基幹及艦船百餘艘之敵艦隊遊弋中，此外，更有二百餘艘之輸送團，爲伺機企圖登陸起見，仍繼續蠢動，而敵之有力機動部隊，依然於該海域游弋中。</p>
<p>沉毀敵艦戰鬥經過</p>
<p>東京一日中央社電　日軍特攻隊航空都隊及海上部隊，收獲擊沉擊毀敵艦之戰鬥經過如次：三月二十六日擊沉空母一艘，擊毀艦種不祥者一艘，二十八日赤心特攻隊拚衝，轟沉中型船艦三艘，一艘起火焚燒，此外，幷可望見慶良間列島方面有數艘起火。又敵驅逐艦六艘，觸魚雷沉沒，日軍海上部隊亦擊沉艦種不詐者六艘（其中四艘未證實）。二十八日夜至二十九日拂曉，日軍特攻隊於慶良間列島北方所獲戰果，在零時三十分望見火柱一處，二時零七分擊沉大型艦一艘，二時五十分焚燒大型艦一艘，三時擊沉小型艦一艘，三時四十分擊沉中型艦一艘，四時四十七分擊沉小型艦二艘，五時五十分擊沉中型艦三艘，擊毀小型艦一艘，六時十八分擊沉艦種不詳者四艘，七時零六分更於南方海面轟沉巡洋艦二艘，重傷燃　大型艦五艘，又於首里南方及東南海面，二時十五分擊沉大型艦一艘，七時二十分見火柱一處，是時久米湊川島南方遮處曾有繼續不斷爆炸聲，然戰果尙未判明。二十九日更由飛機偵察判明，五時五十八分，寺山等特攻機隊，於那　西寺海面轟沉中型艦二艘，擊沉中型艦一艘，起火者一艘，晨四時，水上部隊於壯谷西方海面炸沉中型艦一艘，艦種不詳者二艘，六時航空部隊擊傷艦種不詳者二艘，戰艦一艘，運輸船一艘爆炸起火，另見火住四處。九時半於伴江島西南方面，擊沉巡洋艦二艘，起火一艘，十一時許，在殘波岬海面擊沉航空母艦一艘，轟沉戰艦一艘，十一時半許，於該方面焚燒驅逐艦五艘，其四周之敵戰艦似已倉惶遁走。</p>

<h3>松島部長　談沖繩戰局　日軍士氣旺盛防備嚴密</h3>
<p>日駐華艦隊報道部部長松島大佐，頃發表談話，對目前戰局闡述綦詳。茲錄內容如次：</p>
<p>敵艦沉毀百艘以上</p>
<p>敵艦隊在冲繩方面，依然以艦砲轟擊，日趨熾烈，日方則充分準備，死守陣地，阻遏敵軍登陸。在該時期內，日航空部隊所獲戰果，如三月三十一日大本營所發表者，擊沉擊毀敵艦船達五十艘以上，但加以未經確認之戰果，則自敵軍來襲南西羣島以來之戰果，擊沉毀已達百艘以上。徵諸以前塞班島。雷伊泰島·林加因灘·硫黃島·三寶顏等前例，敵方每次在二日問施以熾烈砲擊後，再行登陸，但今次自十八日以來，歷十數日，迄今猶未登陸，此可證明日方防備嚴密之一斑。</p>
<p>日守備隊充分準備</p>
<p>在此時期內，敵艦船被擊沉擊毀者，前一後共計九十艘以上，此對敵人今後作戰行動，將引起重大障礙，吾人對前綫將土之奮戰，表示衷心謝忱，同時並應更加奮勵，幼坊止敵人之登陸，將敵人殲滅於海灘。但從最近一二天內，形勢判斷，敵一人似將開始登陸行動，相一信日陸海空三方面之攻擊一，必將使敵人蒙受慘重打擊，日軍陸上守備部隊，充分準備，採取不使機會一稍從之戰法，此純爲堅强自信力之表現，以及鑒於一過去許多貴重敎訓所致。</p>
<p>敵英海軍加入作戰</p>
<p>最近美國太平洋艦隊中，已加入洛林格中將所率之英國太平洋艦隊，自表面上而觀，此當然是英美太平洋艦隊在太平洋上共同作戰，但事實上，美海軍所以放棄其驕傲態度，歡迎英海軍加人作戰，實因美艦隊損失過重也。</p>
<p>戰局演變須具戒心</p>
<p>此次戰果極爲煊赫，目的唯在殲滅敵來寇部隊，但思及敵尙殘留有相當艦艇，則對戰局之演變尙須具戒心。最近上海方面敵機再度作偵察行動，可視爲對於南西羣島方面之牽制行動，以及某種次期行動之準備，吾人須加充分注意。今日處此最熾烈之決戰階段，前綫將兵士氣旺盛，我東亞民族，亦應鞏固克服一切困一難之信心。</p>

<h3>新海軍與新海運的　敎育信念</h3>
<p>二屆海軍節姜西園氏廣播詞</p>
<p>昨日爲我國第二届海軍節日，本市方面由中央海軍學校舉行盛大閱兵式外，該校校長姜西園中將特於昨晚假上海電台向全國廣播，講題爲「新海軍與新海運的敎育信念」。大意如次；</p>
<p>新的機稱</p>
<p>新海軍的全般機構是一個最合乎科學的機動體，以海軍部為最高首腦機關，統御全國海軍，在沿岸要地，如南京·廣州。威海衛。漢口等處分設要港部或基地部等，並於共所屬區域配置基地羣，形成强有力的海軍勢力網。並於上海設置水路測最局，以楊子江爲本位，而逐漸擴張至全國沿江沿海各水道，成續已甚昭著。至於敎育機關，除在各要港部附屬練兵營以精練海軍士兵外，並於上海設有中央水兵訓練所，爲全國士兵敎育中心。</p>
<p>訓練一斑</p>
<p>全國海軍軍官教育，由上海中央海軍學校擔任之，校址設在上海龍華路上，海軍青年學子，都是從全國各處考選而來，他們所受的敎育絕不似從前那樣壘守成法有體無用的敎育，而是文武平衡志氣體一實的活潑猛烈的敎育，每日間眞是一分一秒也不能放過。學科講堂分上下午舉行，各種科學以及各種專門學術分三學年的進度實施，術科敎綽則分早上與下午課後舉行，手旗·燈號·刺槍·劍道·柔道·國術·短艇·結索·陸戰演習等，除有種種敎育器材而外，幷配有敎練用飛機大砲，練習艦艇，以供學術兩科的應用。最注重的是每晨的精神點檢，確立軍人不動的意志與姿態，每週的精神敎育，係由國學中提出志氣體三項要領來爲修養智信仁勇嚴等將德之手段，以期陶鑄我國的傳統精神而符智深勇沉的校訓，實現興復中華保衛東亞的時代使命。每年冬季有嚴寒猛練，夏季有酷暑猛練及游泳，三年中有艦上實習與航海實習多次，幷參加艦隊戰鬥演習等等，三年畢業後，即由海軍部分派各艦艇各部隊開始下級官員的勤務。在待遇方面，可幷不怎樣優厚，并且在衣食等項十分堪忍着戰時的艱苦。</p>
<p>並舉事業</p>
<p>上面所講的新海軍，乃是與新海軍相提並舉得事業，現在上海中央水兵訓練所內設有中央高等商船學校，商船人才與海軍人才受同樣的敎育訓練，眞可以說是新時代的體制了。將來新海運與新海軍的並駕齊驅是可指日而待的。高等商船學生的招考與海軍學生的招考，也是同時的，不過高等海船學生在校修學期間爲二年，畢業後即分派商船上任職服務。</p>
<p>三種信念</p>
<p>在新海軍與新海運急速發展之下，我們在教育立塲來觀察發生了以下三種的信念：第一，新海軍與新海運的建造，乃是適當大東亞戰爭下的建設，一方面由戰爭上得到新的建設經騐，一方面要以新的建設來供獻給戰爭前途的勝利。第二，中日同盟關係加强了中日合作的精神，提高了新建設的效率，就以新海軍與新海運兩項事業來講，尤其顯著。第三我們認定敎塲即戰塲，戰塲即道塲，並認定各愛其國，互愛其鄰，其愛東亞的偉大遺訓，深契乎我國修養恰平地傳統方式與時代十名，尤其合而一致，這便是本校敎育訓練電點之所在。期望由此點爲出發，以追隨最高領袖，供默一切於中華國運之復興，東亞民族之解放。</p>
<p>社會服務</p>

<p>師生協力捐款捐書</p>
<p>德化小學四年級全體同學來函說：「本是期一上第一課時繆先生就吿訴我們，申報在創辦十只義小，和謝立林先生發起「義學金」的事。幷讀了許多捐款者的信給我們聰，使我們慚愧和感動。接着先生鼓勵我們：「要像去年捐助學金時的精神，來做到下面三點：　自己一節省和請家長捐，　捐出讀過的舊書，　吿訴里弄裏失學的小朋友去報名。但我們的家長，都是很淸寒的，同學中很多是靠助帶學金來實書的。終於經過二天的努力，我們四年級全體同學勉力地捐集了五千元，繆先生也捐一千元，共計六十元。另外舊書九十五本，其餘一百廿五，六，年級同學合捐的，共計二百十五本。」</p>

<h3>The Third Navy Day Was Solemnly Commemorated Yesterday; Acting Chairman Chen Personally Delivered an Earnest Instruction</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 1st (Central News Agency telegram) – The first of the month is our country's Third Navy Day. Coming two days after the fifth anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital, looking back, although the National Government was faced with devastation and a difficult environment after the return, it has been actively pursuing the construction of a new navy. Its scale is now taking shape and development is promising. At this time of total decisive battle, coinciding with a Navy Day of profound significance in the history of our country's naval reconstruction, we feel infinitely inspired. The Ministry of the Navy held a solemn commemorative ceremony in the auditorium of the Ministry yesterday morning at 9:00 a.m., led by Minister Ling, with the participation of hundreds of officers from the Nanjing Garrison Headquarters and other affiliated units in the capital. Acting Chairman Chen personally attended and gave instructions, clarifying the National Government's determination to rebuild the navy, stating that talent should prioritize spiritual education, his words were extremely earnest, and all the officers who respectfully listened were deeply moved. In the evening at 7:00 p.m., Minister Ling also hosted a banquet at the International Club to entertain senior naval officers of allied nations to foster camaraderie.</p>
<h3>Minister Ling's Broadcast Speech Explains the Significance of Navy Day</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 1st (Central News Agency telegram) – Navy Minister Ling Qing, with the theme of "The Significance of Navy Day," gave a special speech to the public. It is hoped that the public will have a sincere understanding of the navy, and further have a clear understanding of the importance of the navy. Because the Chinese people have a weak concept of the ocean, they regard the navy as insignificant.</p>
<p>The Origin of the Emphasis on Land and Neglect of the Sea Concept</p>
<p>According to historical records, since Emperor Huangdi established the nation, the development path of the Chinese nation has been to govern the Yellow River basin from west to east, and then gradually move south after the Zhou, Qin, Han, Tang, Song, and Ming dynasties, eventually settling and multiplying in the two major basins of the Yangtze and Pearl Rivers, and occupying the vast territory of today. Due to the historical development from west to east and from north to south, border troubles in the past dynasties were all in the northwest, which cultivated the Chinese people's concept of emphasizing land and neglecting the sea. Until the late Qing Dynasty, when Europeans invaded the East, the Opium War and the Sino-French War resulted in the loss of territory and indemnities. People with insight gradually realized the importance of coastal defense, which was more important than the northwest border defense. Therefore, the wise men such as Zeng and Li at that time strongly opposed public opinion and established the navy. After the Sino-Japanese War, the Chinese people became indifferent to the importance of the navy again. After the founding of the Republic of China, the country was in turmoil. When the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, some people who talked about national defense even made the absurd argument that the navy should be abandoned and only the air force should be built. The Chinese people did not understand and echoed it, which was no different from choking on food and abandoning eating, or cutting off an arm to seek health.</p>
<p>Prudent Statesmanship and Naval Reconstruction</p>
<p>At this time and place, Mr. Chen, our Chairman, happened to be in the central hub of Japan, and had written articles to criticize its wrongdoing. It can be said that he was prudent in his statesmanship and had a unique vision. The reason why our country's navy was able to survive is thanks to this. In 1940, the National Government returned to the capital, and the authorities made great efforts to build a new navy. In order to make the Chinese people truly recognize the importance of the navy to a modern country, it was specially decreed in 1943 that April 1st be Navy Day. Its significance is very profound, not only to encourage the personnel of the new navy to strive forward and be able to shoulder important tasks, but also to make the Chinese people feel the importance of the navy and to advocate and assist it, so that it can be developed and carried forward day by day. Last year, the second Navy Day, all agencies and offices affiliated with the Ministry in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan and other places held enthusiastic and grand celebrations. The people of the whole country also had a new look, and they all knew that the construction of our country's new navy has been roughly prepared. With this promotion, the national coastal defense can be consolidated day by day, changing the previous drawbacks of open doors. It is a great event.</p>
<p>Fulfilling Duties and Assisting Allies</p>
<p>This year, April 1st, the third Navy Day is approaching, coinciding with the tension of the Pacific War, and the holy war for the liberation of Greater East Asia has reached the decisive stage. The evolution of the navy's affairs is particularly obvious to the war situation. The allied nation, Japan, has a strong combined fleet, so it can be fearless, wait for work at leisure, wait for the most favorable time, and defeat the enemy in one fell swoop to annihilate the enemy and harvest the final victory. At this critical moment, how should all my naval comrades assist the Allied forces step by step and not give up their responsibilities at all? How should all Chinese people have a more advanced understanding of the navy, urge and advocate, so that the future of our navy will become brighter? This is what this Navy Day asks. I am the head of the Ministry of the Navy. I will abide by the national policy, supervise my subordinates, and gradually promote the various construction plans of the planned new navy. Now, human and material resources are extremely difficult. However, with the full assistance and guidance of the Allied countries, if we can pursue the matter with the spirit of perseverance, we will eventually succeed. I hope that the people of the whole country will extend their love for the country to love the navy, and do not hesitate to promote and assist from the sidelines, then the revitalization of the navy is truly dependent on it.</p>
<h3>Sweeping Across the Plains of Henan Province, the Japanese Army Occupied Nanyang; Simultaneously Breaking into the Laohekou Airfield</h3>
<p>Japanese Army Base on the Henan Front, 1st (Central News Agency telegram) – The elite of the North China Area Japanese Army, sweeping across the plains of Henan and continuing to attack, after breaking through the resistance of the 6th Army of the Second Group Army in Fangcheng Erhe, approached the advanced base of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing outside Nanyang on the dawn of the 27th. They cooperated with the rapid troops coming south from Nanzhao. On the dawn of the 17th, they attacked the fortifications fortified last year by the Chongqing army, such as the heavy artillery positions and mountain artillery positions, to make a final resistance. However, the elite of the Japanese army broke into the road at the northeast gate. By noon on the same day, Nanyang was completely occupied.</p>
<p>Henan Front, 21st (Central News Agency telegram) – The US Air Force stationed in Chongqing is planning to actively advance its base in order to respond to the US Air Force's urgent air strikes against Japan. The various elite units of the North China Japanese Army have made full preparations for approaching the First War Zone Army under the direct descendants of Hu Zongnan of Daoqing along the Pinghan Road and the Fifth War Zone Army under Liu Qi. On March 22, they echoed each other with the Central China Japanese Army and suddenly launched operations in several columns from the west side of Pinghan Road, advancing southwest at the same time. On the 27th, they broke into the Laohekou airfield and completely occupied it. The Japanese army troops located on the northern foot of the Funiu Mountains, in order to drive out the newly formed 6th and 8th divisions under Gao Shuxun, the commander of the 39th Group Army, which were resisting in the mountain positions, captured Nantai (100 kilometers southwest of Zhengzhou) on the 25th. On the 24th, the mobile tank unit defeated the temporarily formed 36th Division of the Fifth War Zone near Fangcheng. The rapid troops drove away the 81st, 74th, and 29th divisions led by Cao Fulin of the 55th Army of the Fifth War Zone on the 23rd. After the Japanese army captured Biyang (220 kilometers southwest of Zhengzhou), they chased the remnants in one breath, broke through the defense of the 41st Army of the 22nd Group Army (Commander Sun Zhen), and broke into the Laohekou Airfield in Hubei Province, the advanced base of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing, at dawn on the 27th. They launched a fierce battle and completely occupied it this afternoon. They are now continuing to attack the city fiercely.</p>
<h3>Lieutenant Colonel Shimada Elaborates on the War Situation</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 1st (Central News Agency telegram) – Lieutenant Colonel Shimada of the Japanese Dispatch Army Press Department met with Chinese reporters at the Japanese Press Club at 5:00 p.m. on the 31st to explain the battle situation of the Laohekou Campaign and the Okinawa Island as follows:</p>
<p>Laohekou Campaign</p>
<p>Since the Ganzhou Suichuan Campaign, Laohekou is the only remaining forward base of the Chongqing US Air Force. According to Laohekou, it is the forwardmost base of the Chongqing US Northwest Air Force Base Army (including Xi'an, Hankou, Ankang and other places). After the Henan War, the main task of the Chongqing US Northwest Air Force was to destroy the important transportation lines and facilities such as Pinghan, Jinpu and the Yangtze River in the west. Now that its forward base, Laohekou Airfield, has been captured, the Chongqing US Northwest Air Force Base Group has suffered a great blow. According to the report, the Chongqing army in the war zone has a total of seventeen or eight divisions. The troops defending Laohekou are Liu Zhi's troops. The Second Division in Nanyang and the 39th Division in Zhenping. Since the Henan War, the Chongqing army in the area has been actively reorganizing in order to restore its strength. At the beginning of the Laohekou Campaign, a part of the Japanese army set out from Lushan, Yexian, Wuyang, Suiping and other places with Nanyang as the target and moved forward. Another part of the Japanese army echoed this and attacked Xiangyang Laohekou from Jingmen and Hanshui. On March 27, the Chongqing army collapsed and retreated to the west bank, Zhichuan, Laohekou line. The 250th Army retreated, a part of which monitored Nanyang, and a part of which attacked Xinye. Its rapid troops broke into the Laohekou Airfield at noon on the 27th. The Chongqing US Air Force in the area had already advanced to Ankang on the evening of the 25th. After the Japanese army occupied the Laohekou Airfield, the Chongqing US Northwest Air Force Base Ankang, Hanzhong, and Xi'an were about 800 kilometers away from Laohekou. The occupation of the Laohekou Airfield is of great significance. It can be divided into the following two points: After the Chongqing US Air Force entered the inland, its activities were farther away from its target. The Chongqing US Northwest Air Force Base Group is the outer defense of the B29-type aircraft base. Laohekou is the front line of its outer base. Therefore, the loss of Laohekou Airfield can indirectly threaten the activities of B29-type aircraft. In addition, in the Pacific Philippines and Okinawa, the activities of the enemy's B29-type aircraft still rely on the protection of fighters on the Chinese mainland. Now that the US Air Force's major forward base has been lost, the activities of B29 in various eastern regions have also been severely hit. Furthermore, most of the enemy aircraft that have been attacking Nanjing recently are fighters that took off from Laohekou. The loss of Laohekou will also reduce the number of enemy air raids on Nanjing.</p>
<p>Okinawa Island</p>
<p>The war on Okinawa Island is now unfolding in the Kerama Islands. At the same time, the enemy troops are shelling the southern part of Okinawa Island with naval guns. The enemy's tactics are similar to those in the past Saipan operations, attempting to cover the landings with this. According to logical speculation, the enemy's attempt to invade the Kerama Islands is nothing more than to obtain a springboard to attack Okinawa Island. On this springboard, they will set up ship anchorages, supply bases, and military hospitals. Once this preparation is complete, they will attack Okinawa Island again. According to the report, when the enemy attacked Saipan, they used the air force as a springboard for the landing. Now, when attacking Okinawa, they use the land base as a springboard. This is the experience gained from the enemy's excessive losses in the Saipan operation. The Kerama Islands are only a dozen miles away from Okinawa Island. It is difficult for a large fleet to operate on this narrow sea. Therefore, the enemy troops divided their fleet into several groups and carried out naval gun shelling on the three sea areas in the southern half of Okinawa Island, so that the enemy ships were afraid of the Japanese army's special attack team for a long time, so their activities were limited to daytime (aircraft can be used for close surveillance in the daytime sky, and the night surveillance is different). The enemy's naval force in Okinawa is about 100 ships, and so far, it has lost one-fifth or even half of them. Although the enemy troops have suffered this loss, they still have a huge naval force in the Pacific. The Japanese army has two major air force bases in Kyushu to the north of Okinawa and Taiwan to the south of Okinawa, which can dispatch large air force units at any time to carry out attacks. In the Battle of Iwo Jima, the enemy lost more than half of its total strength. In the Battle of Okinawa Island, the enemy's losses will be even greater. Therefore, the success of the Japanese army in the future is worth noting.</p>

<h3>Governor Ren Yuan Dao Talks About the Security and Finances of Jiangsu Province</h3>
<p>— Tang Yi</p>
<p>"The security situation in Jiangsu Province is neither good nor bad. In reality, the situation is definitely not as bad as rumored outside. We can immediately improve the security of a place, but as soon as the troops are transferred, it returns to its original state." When the reporter discussed the issue of evacuating the population of Shanghai with Governor Ren, he explained this way when talking about improving security.</p>
<p>"To restore the security situation before the incident, the problem is very simple, that is, to end the incident. Because of the incident, two kinds of thoughts have been produced. At present, there is undoubtedly a need for peace, but the advocates of resistance against Japan are trying to justify their arguments. The bad thing is that some cunning people are using this as an excuse to seek personal gain; those with weapons are raising the banner of resistance against Japan, and those without weapons are also taking the opportunity to extort. Some village chiefs and ward heads even hope that the security situation is bad, deliberately exaggerating their words in order to fish in troubled waters. Those who listen do not understand the truth, and spread it from one to ten, and from ten to one hundred, thinking that the situation is very serious.</p>
<p>"To eliminate this situation, it is not that there is no way, just kill, but since the establishment of the Reformed Government, I have always adhered to military power. Except for the unfortunate encounters on the battlefield, it can be said that I have never killed anyone. If I carry out large-scale killings, I can certainly improve the security immediately, but generally speaking, they are compatriots, and there is no reason to kill each other. Secondly, if the government's finances are abundant, it can raise a large number of soldiers and engage in suppression. If not, there are many positions to appease and accommodate these people who are raising the banner of resistance against Japan, which can also solve the problem, but in fact, it is not allowed.</p>
<p>"If the incident ends that day, eliminating the divergent thoughts, and cunning people have no excuse, the security can be restored to its original state that day." Governor Ren said here, with a smile on his face, seemingly full of confidence.</p>
<p>The reporter said: "Raising the salaries of civil servants is also an important issue."</p>
<p>Governor Ren said: "Yes, to maintain military discipline and increase the work efficiency of politicians, there is only one way, which is to raise salaries.</p>
<p>"However, we cannot only focus on raising salaries and ignore the people's burden. It is very difficult to increase financial income and raise civil servants' salaries without increasing the people's burden.</p>
<p>"Of course, there are other ways, such as reorganizing the current tax revenue. In the past six months, reorganizing the tax revenue and eliminating the results of corruption have increased the revenue by 100 million yuan, which is already a large amount. However, if it is used to increase the salaries of civil servants for half a year, it will only be more than 100 million yuan per month. In fact, we have already raised the salaries of civil servants, military police, and teachers in the province. Just raising a little bit will cost an additional 30 million yuan per month. However, there is still no way to curb the rise in prices. On the one hand, we have to consider the people's burden, and on the other hand, we have to enrich the financial resources to ensure the minimum living standards of civil servants. This work is very difficult, but I have this determination, and I hope that all civil servants will work hard to support the war."</p>
<p>Finally, the reporter mentioned Governor Ren's words in Shanghai about building three Shanghai-Suzhou highways. Governor Ren said: "It has already started. In terms of labor, there are no difficulties because each county is responsible for the projects within its territory. However, the construction funds of 200 million yuan are still waiting to be raised!"</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Launches Offensive on Germany's Southeast Border; Vienna is the Ultimate Goal</h3>
<p>Berlin, 1st (Central News Agency telegram) – Reuters: Germany's southeastern border area has become the focus of the Eastern Front in the past three days due to the Soviet Union's new offensive. At present, the Soviet Union's purpose in attacking the area is twofold: one is to advance westward, but there has been no progress recently; the other is to advance northward, with Neustadt as the target. The vanguard of the Soviet Union has already crossed the German border between Stainabrück and Görnitz, and turned northward, and has now advanced to the Rabb-Odenburg railway line. The Soviet Union's troops advancing westward north of the Danube River are now blocked in front of the German defense area between the Neutra and Waag rivers, that is, in the area west of Neuhäusel-Komorn. Therefore, the Soviet Union has made little progress in the Graz, Vienna, and Pressburg areas. If the Soviet Union still regards Vienna as the ultimate goal, fierce battles will break out in a few weeks.</p>
<p>The Situation in Silesia is Tense</p>
<p>Berlin, 1st (Central News Agency telegram) – German News Agency: The war in Upper Silesia is gradually becoming tense. Although the Soviet Union's attack on Loslau has collapsed, west of Radibor, the Soviet Union, with the assistance of strong tank units, has deeply penetrated the German line of defense, but it was later blocked by the German army.</p>
<h3>Situation on the Western Front</h3>
<p>Berlin, 31st (Central News Agency telegram) – Due to the rapid advance of the US First and Third Armies, the anti-Axis forces have controlled the central Rhine area from Paderborn in the north to Frankfurt in the east in the south.</p>
<h3>Mr. Wang Yintai Broadcasts to the Nation in Nanjing</h3>
<p>"Commemorating the Return to the Capital and Completing Peaceful Unification"</p>
<p>Nanjing, 1st (Central News Agency telegram) – Wang Yintai, Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Commission, gave a broadcast to the national public at the Central Broadcasting Station on the evening of the 31st, entitled "Commemorating the Return to the Capital and Completing Peaceful Unification," stating briefly:</p>
<p>The first thing I want to say is that the North China Political Affairs Commission is a local administrative organ under the National Government. The people of the north require unity and a belief in the revival of the motherland. I can represent everyone and explain this central belief here.</p>
<p>Self-Reliance and Revival</p>
<p>The compatriots in the north and the compatriots in the south are completely consistent and absolutely the same. In terms of the overall situation, although the current country is divided, compatriots in all aspects are thinking about the arrival of peaceful unification. The purpose of saving the country and saving the nation is originally consistent regardless of which compatriots are involved. China needs self-reliance and revival, completely using its own strength to improve the status of the country and the nation, and then it can cooperate with countries and nations that treat me equally. Then, just ask whether we have sincerity and determination. It can also be said that as long as we have such sincerity and determination, no matter what difficulties and obstacles there are, it is not difficult to destroy them one by one in the line of persevering and courageous progress.</p>
<p>Cultivating People's Livelihood</p>
<p>Secondly, I would like to talk about my feelings on the issue of public opinion. This time, I came to participate in the excitement of the central government commemorating the return to the capital. The meeting the day before yesterday must have gained very valuable and original harvests. We should, on the one hand, sincerely ask for the cooperation of our compatriots, and on the other hand, with Chairman Chen's determination to rectify officialdom, clearly recognize that "politics of the wise," or in other words, the issue of governing people, is what is most needed in this very time. Recognize that only by cultivating the people's livelihood can we enhance national strength and achieve the mission of seeking unification internally and liberation externally.</p>
<p>Encouraging the Future</p>
<p>We should honestly examine the past and encourage the future. Because we respect public opinion, we should go to the realization of public opinion and actively build the government on the people.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Attack Kyushu</h3>

In the future, the B29-type aircraft's air raids on Kyushu will become more intense.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>On the War Situation in Ryukyu</h3>
<p>Recently, following the operation on Iwo Jima, the enemy United States is attempting to land on Okinawa in the Ryukyu Islands. The Ryukyu Islands are also known as the Nansei Islands, with Okinawa being the largest. Its capital, Naha, is 450 kilometers from Kagoshima in Kyushu, Japan, 510 kilometers from Taipei, Taiwan, 540 kilometers from Ningbo and Wenzhou in China, and 650 kilometers from this city [Shanghai]. The future trend of the war situation is worthy of our close attention. At the same time, the enemy United States is also launching a strategic offensive, creating various rumors in an attempt to disturb the people's hearts. In this situation, we should remain calm and not be misled by rumors.</p>
<p>The enemy United States' objective in launching an offensive against the Ryukyu Islands can be viewed from two aspects: First, in terms of political strategy, the enemy United States intends to gain an advantage in the upcoming San Francisco Conference scheduled for April 25th, in order to achieve its ambition of dominating the Far East in the future. This, of course, depends on the actual situation of its operations in East Asia. If it cannot achieve a so-called "operational advantage" before the conference, it will inevitably be questioned by the Soviet Union and other countries at the conference. Therefore, the enemy United States cannot but engage in greater military adventures. Second, in terms of strategy, the main objective is to seize strong air bases to strengthen the strategic bombing of allied Japan's wartime production, and at the same time, to use Okinawa Island as a center to strengthen the disruption of transportation and communication within 500 to 1,000 kilometers, covering China, Manchuria, and various parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Then, does the enemy United States have any hope of achieving this goal? Before making a judgment, we must recognize that the most important conditions for the enemy to achieve these political and strategic objectives are: 1. A quick victory: If the goal cannot be achieved before April 25th, the international war situation and diplomatic situation will change, and the enemy United States will have to admit failure; 2. Strong logistical support: If this cannot be done, its main fleet will inevitably be bogged down and depleted by the Japanese army. If the positions of attacker and defender are reversed, it will also inevitably fall into failure; 3. Neutralizing other Japanese forces: the enemy must neutral other Japanese forces to prevent the Japanese army from transferring troops from other locations and even force them to deploy troops elsewhere; otherwise, the isolated and deeply penetrated main attacking force of the enemy United States will still suffer heavy casualties and fail to achieve its political and strategic objectives.</p>
<p>Does the enemy United States possess these three necessary conditions today? First, regarding the point of neutralizing enemy forces, the dispersion of American forces in the Pacific can be understood by observing the vast distances between the islands occupied by the enemy United States in its counteroffensives. The difficulty of mutual support and cooperation between enemy forces will inevitably increase in the future. As for the enemy British forces, the offensives against Sumatra, the counteroffensive against the Malay Peninsula, and even the landing on the Indochina Peninsula and Leizhou Peninsula, are all just unfounded rumors. The Indian colonies are barely able to take care of themselves, and the airstrikes by a few hundred planes will not have much impact on the war situation. Secondly, the so-called "Chongqing counteroffensive" in response to the United States is even more unreliable, as the issue of cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communists in Chongqing remains at a stalemate. From this, it can be seen that the enemy United States does not possess this condition. On the contrary, the Japanese army's launch of the Henan offensive in China, the capture of Nanyang, and the penetration into Laohekou and the air raid on Changting, have achieved the effect of a counter-neutralization operation in the Pacific.</p>
<p>Second, in the landing operation in northern France last year, the enemy United States used 124,000 troops and 3,400 ships of various sizes. In the past landing in the Philippines, it used more than 270,000 troops and more than 1,000 ships. In the operation on Iwo Jima, it used 220,000 troops and more than 800 ships of various sizes. Now, in the battle for the Ryukyu Islands, the number of troops and ships used can be imagined. Furthermore, a large number of troops must be used to maintain each occupied area. Therefore, the condition of strong logistical support is not met.</p>
<p>Third, since the above two major conditions cannot be met, the condition of "quick victory" is even more out of the question. Therefore, they cannot but resort to strategic propaganda, creating all kinds of rumors to shake the morale of the Axis powers in East Asia, in order to facilitate the condition of a quick victory.</p>
<p>Therefore, we must point out that the enemy United States' offensive against the Ryukyu Islands does not possess any conditions for success. However, judging from the enemy's political and strategic objectives and the geographical situation of the new war zone, the crisis of a landing operation on the Chinese mainland and the invasion of the Japanese mainland are equally serious. The Chongqing National Government's public announcement on March 26th also stated: "Recent military developments indicate that operations against Japan will soon unfold on the Chinese mainland," which is also something we cannot ignore. We must use all our strength to oppose the transformation of China into a battlefield, resolutely eliminate all enemy rumors, and prepare calmly for the future decisive battle with a clear mind and a determination to win.</p>
<h3>More Than 100 Enemy Ships Sunk and Destroyed in Ryukyu Battle; Enemy Lands in Southern Okinawa Island Yesterday</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) – The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 3:00 PM on the 1st: On the morning of March 31st, the enemy in the vicinity of Okinawa Island landed a portion of its forces on Kamiyama Island and Mae Island. On the morning of April 1st, it began landing its main force in the southern region of Okinawa Island. The Japanese air force and naval units attacked enemy ships, and the subsequent results have been confirmed as follows: one aircraft carrier sunk, two cruisers sunk, two destroyers sunk, three ships of unknown type sunk, one battleship or cruiser sunk or destroyed, one battleship or cruiser destroyed, two destroyers destroyed, one ship of unknown type destroyed, one transport ship sunk.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) – At approximately 7:20 AM on the 1st, enemy troops landed in the southern part of Okinawa Island, dividing their main force into two groups. One group, consisting of 30 large landing craft and 70 small landing craft, began landing near the southwest 4km side of Minatogawa. The other group, consisting of 150 large landing craft and 60 small landing craft, attempted to land on the front of Chatan and Kadena. The Japanese army is currently launching a fierce attack on them.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) – Since the enemy mobile force appeared in the Ryukyu Islands on March 23rd, the confirmed results of the Japanese air force and naval units are: 59 ships sunk, 6 ships sunk or destroyed, and 40 ships destroyed, totaling 105 ships. The details are as follows:</p>

<p>Destroyed: 1 battleship, 11 battleships or cruisers, 1 cruiser, 10 destroyers, 4 transport ships, 13 ships of unknown type.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) – For days, the enemy mobile force has been bombing and strafing Okinawa Island and its surrounding areas with hundreds to five hundred carrier-based aircraft, while simultaneously firing thousands of naval gunshots. The enemy troops who landed on Kamiyama and Mae Islands on the 31st immediately constructed heavy artillery positions on the islands and equipped them with four heavy artillery pieces, which have now begun test firing. The Japanese air force and naval units have repeatedly launched fierce attacks on enemy ships in recent days. According to the announcement of the Japanese General Headquarters on the 1st, a total of 105 ships have been sunk or destroyed. It goes without saying that the actual results will be even greater than this. However, an enemy fleet with a core of more than a dozen battleships and more than a hundred ships is still cruising in the sea area. In addition, there is a transport group of more than two hundred ships, continuing to move in order to take the opportunity to land. Moreover, the enemy's powerful mobile force is still cruising in the sea area.</p>
<p>Details of the Battle of Sinking and Destroying Enemy Ships</p>

<h3>Special Tribunal Shanghai Branch Formally Established Yesterday; Internal Organization and Key Personnel Announced</h3>
<p>The National Government established a Special Tribunal in the capital last year. The Shanghai branch has been set up following the decision of the 66th meeting of the Supreme National Defense Council, and the organization regulations of the Shanghai branch have been promulgated. Cai Rixin, the former Chief Prosecutor of Jiangsu Province, was specially appointed as the President of the Tribunal, and Zhao Zhengdang and Gao Weiqu were appointed as judges.

President Cai, along with judges Zhao and Gao and other important officials, arrived at the court before 9:00 AM to inspect the premises and announce their assumption of office. President Cai did not hold a ceremony in order to keep things simple. It is reported that the internal organization and important personnel of the branch are as follows: President Cai Rixin, judges Zhao Zhengdang and Gao Weiqu. In addition, there is a Clerk's Office, with Hao Wenlu as the Chief Clerk, under which there are General Affairs, Records, and Sections.

<h3>Minister Matsushima Discusses the Okinawa War Situation: Japanese Troops Have High Morale and Strict Defense</h3>
<p>Colonel Matsushima, the head of the press department of the Japanese Fleet in China, recently gave a speech elaborating on the current war situation in great detail. The content is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>More Than 100 Enemy Ships Sunk and Destroyed</p>
<p>The enemy fleet is still bombarding the Okinawa area with naval guns, and it has become increasingly fierce. The Japanese side is fully prepared, defending the positions to the death and preventing the enemy from landing. During this period, the Japanese air force has achieved results, as announced by the General Headquarters on March 31, sinking and destroying more than 50 enemy ships. However, including unconfirmed results, the total since the enemy's attack on the Nansei Islands has reached more than 100 ships. Based on the previous examples of Saipan, Leyte Island, Lingayen Gulf, Iwo Jima, and Zamboanga, the enemy usually conducts fierce bombardment for two days before landing, but this time it has been more than ten days since the 18th, and there has been no landing yet. This proves the strictness of the Japanese defense.</p>
<p>The Japanese Garrison is Fully Prepared</p>
<p>During this period, more than 90 enemy ships have been sunk and destroyed, both before and after. This will cause significant obstacles to the enemy's future operations. We express our heartfelt gratitude to the officers and soldiers on the front lines for their brave fighting. At the same time, we should work even harder to prevent the enemy from landing and annihilate the enemy on the beaches. However, judging from the situation in the last day or two, the enemy seems to be starting a landing operation. We believe that the attacks from the Japanese army, navy, and air force will surely cause the enemy heavy casualties. The Japanese army's ground garrison is fully prepared, adopting a battle method that does not allow any opportunity to be missed. This is purely a manifestation of strong self-confidence and a result of learning from many valuable lessons in the past.</p>
<p>British Navy Joins the Operation</p>
<p>Recently, the British Pacific Fleet led by Lieutenant General Rawling has joined the US Pacific Fleet. On the surface, this is of course a joint operation of the British and American Pacific Fleets in the Pacific. However, in fact, the US Navy abandoned its proud attitude and welcomed the British Navy to join the operation because the US fleet had suffered too heavy losses.</p>
<p>War Situation Evolution Requires Caution</p>
<p>The results of this battle are extremely significant, and the purpose is only to annihilate the enemy's invading forces. However, considering that the enemy still has a considerable number of ships remaining, we must be cautious about the evolution of the war situation. Recently, enemy aircraft in the Shanghai area have conducted reconnaissance operations again, which can be seen as a restraint operation against the Nansei Islands and a preparation for some kind of next-stage action. We must pay full attention. Today, we are in the most intense stage of the decisive battle. The morale of the officers and soldiers on the front lines is high. Our East Asian nations should also consolidate their confidence in overcoming all difficulties.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Attacked Shanghai Yesterday; All Repelled</h3>
<p>At 2:13 PM on the 1st, several US P-51 fighters invaded the Shanghai area and dropped several bombs in the suburbs. However, the losses were minimal. The Japanese army counterattacked and repelled all enemy aircraft at 2:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Air Defense Training Institute Third Class Enrolls</h3>
<p>The third class of students at the Shanghai Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters Air Defense Training Institute held an enrollment ceremony at the former site of the Jing'an Temple Road Racecourse yesterday (1st) at 10:00 AM. Director Zhou, who also serves as the director of the institute, was unable to attend and preside over the ceremony due to official business. Director Wu of the Baojia Office, who also serves as the honorary education director of the institute, delivered a speech on his behalf. Fire Chief Ide and Li Guohua, the police chiefs of various districts in the city, also attended on time. The honorary education director made a training speech, and Fire Chief Ide and others delivered speeches in succession, and the ceremony ended.</p>
<h3>Model Self-Defense Pre-Inspection</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Police Department's Self-Defense Headquarters is uniformly organizing model pre-inspection of national staff in various districts. A large-scale joint pre-inspection will be held on the 3rd of this month. Some districts are holding preliminary inspections. Taishan, Lujia Hong, Changshu, Xujiahui, Xieqiao, Penglai, Yi Chao, and seven other districts in the city held a comprehensive pre-inspection at the Lingbao Road Zero-Dan University Square at 5:00 PM on the 1st. Section Chief Xiao Gang and Qiu Penmin from the District Headquarters were present to provide guidance.</p>
<h3>Mayor Zhou Concurrently Serves as Chairman of the New Shanghai Association</h3>
<p>The chairman of the Shanghai District Branch of the New People's Society was originally appointed by former Mayor Chen. Mayor Zhou now serves as the chairman of the association concurrently. After Secretary-General Xi Peiwen resigned, Mr. Shen Qian has been appointed.</p>
<h3>Police Arrest Wire Thief</h3>
<p>Recently, the exposed telephone and electric wires in the city have been frequently cut and interrupted. The Municipal Police Department has long ordered its subordinates to investigate and arrest the perpetrators. Last month, Detective Zhou Wenqing received a tip and arrested Wang Ah San, a thief from Yangzhou, who specialized in stealing these wires. He has committed 15 cases. Based on his confession, Zhang Shaowei, who received the stolen goods, was arrested on Rue Ratard. He bought and resold the stolen wires for profit. The investigation of the two criminals has been completed, and they have been transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation in accordance with the law.</p>

<p>Public Basketball A Group A – Zhongbei Wins Championship – Hualiao Defeated in Yesterday's Final</p>
<p>In the Public Basketball League, A Group A, due to a tie between Zhongbei and Mu Lian in previous matches, a final match was scheduled to determine the champion. To maintain order, it was secretly held at the Ba Xian Qiao YMCA yesterday morning at 10:00 AM. Few spectators were present. Hualiao's strength was greatly diminished due to the absence of key players Fan Qinggong, Quan Changchun, Zhang Xianlun, and Qu Xilin, who had gone north. Yesterday, they could only field Bo Tuo, Zhang Liangxiong, Chen Zuoliang, Xu Jusheng, Kong Guangyi, Wu Chengzhang, and others. Zhongbei fielded all players except for Shen Yugong, who was still injured. The first half was tense, ending with Zhongbei leading 21 to 18 by three points. In the second half, Hualiao scored again, narrowing the gap to just one point. Unfortunately, at 28 to 22, Xu Jusheng was fouled out, leaving Hualiao with only four players, which significantly weakened them. The final score was 53 to 34, with Zhongbei winning the championship.</p>

<h3>The Educational Beliefs of the New Navy and New Maritime Transport</h3>
<p>Radio Address by Mr. Jiang Xiyuan on the Second Navy Day</p>
<p>Yesterday was our nation's second Navy Day. In this city, the Central Naval Academy held a grand parade. Furthermore, the academy's president, Vice Admiral Jiang Xiyuan, delivered a radio address to the nation from the Shanghai Radio Station last night, titled "The Educational Beliefs of the New Navy and New Maritime Transport." The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>New Mechanisms</p>
<p>The overall structure of the New Navy is a highly scientific and mobile entity. The Ministry of the Navy serves as the highest governing body, commanding the entire national navy. Important coastal locations, such as Nanjing, Guangzhou, Weihaiwei, and Hankou, have established key port departments or base departments. These departments are configured with base groups within their respective areas, forming a strong naval network. Furthermore, a hydrographic survey bureau has been established in Shanghai, using the Yangtze River as its base and gradually expanding to waterways along the entire national coastline. Significant progress has already been made. As for educational institutions, in addition to training camps attached to each key port department for refining naval soldiers, the Central Naval Training Center has been established in Shanghai as the national center for soldier education.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Training</p>
<p>The national naval officer education is undertaken by the Central Naval Academy in Shanghai, located on Longhua Road. Naval cadets are selected from all over the country. The education they receive is not like the outdated and ineffective methods of the past. It is a vibrant and intense education that balances academic and military skills, spirit, and physical fitness. Every minute of every day is fully utilized. Academic lectures are held in the mornings and afternoons. Various sciences and specialized academic subjects are implemented over a three-year curriculum. Practical training is conducted in the mornings and after afternoon classes. Hand flags, signal lamps, bayonet practice, kendo, judo, national martial arts, dinghy sailing, knot tying, and land warfare exercises are included. In addition to various educational materials, training aircraft, cannons, and training ships are provided for the application of both academic and practical subjects. The most important aspect is the daily mental check-up, which establishes unwavering military will and posture. The weekly spiritual education draws from the three key elements of ambition, spirit, and body found in traditional Chinese learning. These serve as means to cultivate the virtues of wisdom, trustworthiness, benevolence, courage, and discipline. The aim is to shape our nation's traditional spirit and align it with the school motto of "wise, deep, brave, and resolute" to realize the historical mission of revitalizing China and safeguarding East Asia. Every winter, there is rigorous cold-weather training. Every summer, there is intense hot-weather training and swimming. During the three years, there are multiple shipboard internships and navigation exercises, as well as participation in fleet combat exercises. Upon graduation after three years, graduates are assigned by the Navy to various ships and units to begin their duties as junior officers. In terms of compensation, it is not particularly generous, and they must endure the hardships of wartime conditions in terms of clothing and food.</p>
<p>Simultaneous Endeavors</p>
<p>The New Navy mentioned above is a program closely aligned with new maritime transport. The Central Higher Merchant Marine School is located within the Central Naval Training Center in Shanghai. Merchant marine talents receive the same education and training as naval talents, representing a true embodiment of the new era's system. The parallel development of the New Maritime Transport and the New Navy can be anticipated in the near future. The recruitment of students for the Higher Merchant Marine School is conducted simultaneously with the recruitment of naval students. However, the duration of study for Higher Merchant Marine students is two years. Upon graduation, they are assigned to positions on merchant ships.</p>
<p>Three Beliefs</p>
<p>With the rapid development of the New Navy and New Maritime Transport, we, from an educational standpoint, have developed the following three beliefs: First, the construction of the New Navy and New Maritime Transport is a development appropriate for the Greater East Asia War. On the one hand, new construction experiences are gained from the war, and on the other hand, the new construction must contribute to the victory of the war's future. Second, the strengthened alliance between China and Japan enhances the spirit of Sino-Japanese cooperation and increases the efficiency of new construction. This is especially evident in the two programs of the New Navy and New Maritime Transport. Third, we believe that the training ground is the battlefield, and the battlefield is the place of moral cultivation. We also believe in the great legacy of loving one's country, loving one's neighbor, and loving East Asia. This deeply aligns with our nation's traditional methods of self-cultivation and the demands of the times, especially in its perfect harmony. This is the focus of our school's education and training. We hope to start from this point to follow the supreme leader and dedicate everything to the revival of China's national destiny and the liberation of the East Asian peoples.</p>
<p>Social Service</p>
<h3>Enthusiastic Advocacy for Charity Schools – Generous Donations from All Sectors</h3>
<p>Mr. Qian Youguan, principal of the Shaoxing Native Middle School in Shanghai, has strongly supported the charity primary school organized by our organization. In addition to generously lending the premises of the Third Primary School of Shaoxing Natives in Shanghai to serve as the Third Charity School and assisting with enrollment matters, he generously donated 10,000 yuan to the charity school yesterday. His enthusiasm for charity education is truly admirable.</p>
<p>A letter from the Sino-Japanese Buddhist Temporary Disaster Relief Association states: "The Association held a charity Peking opera performance, and after deducting all expenses, all donations will be allocated to various charitable organizations in the city to handle poverty relief work. The allocation is as follows: 165,000 yuan to the Shen Bao Compulsory Education Committee, 165,000 yuan to the News Daily Social Service Department, 150,000 yuan to the Zhong Jiao Daoyi Association, 150,000 yuan to the Buddhist Infant Protection Institute, 150,000 yuan to the Jingye Rehabilitation Center, 150,000 yuan to the Ren Ci Charity Association, 150,000 yuan to the Liji Society, and 50,000 yuan to the Production Conservation Group, totaling 1,130,000 yuan. Starting today, all organizations can prepare documentation to claim the funds."</p>
<p>A worker named Lin Shaoxiang wrote: "I am doing hard labor in Shanghai. In my spare time, I read your newspaper and beneficial books, and I feel that I do not know enough characters (I am a senior primary school graduate). A few days ago, I saw in your newspaper that you were founding charity primary schools and managing the 'Charity School Fund.' I felt that the general poor and out-of-school children's parties were getting the opportunity to study, which was very interesting. Now I am sending a sum of money, totaling 10,000 yuan, that I have saved from my daily life to donate to the "Charity School Fund," please check and accept. I will continue to save in the future, and when I have accumulated a considerable amount, I will send it again. Although this amount is small, in a place like Shanghai with a large population, if everyone can save some money, gathering it together, the amount will definitely be considerable!"</p>
<p>Teachers and Students Cooperate in Donating Money and Books</p>
<p>The entire fourth-grade class of Dehua Primary School wrote: "When the first lesson of this semester started, Mr. Miao told us about the Shen Bao founding ten charity primary schools and Mr. Xie Lilin initiating the "Charity School Fund." He also read many letters from donors to us, which made us feel ashamed and touched. Then the teacher encouraged us: 'To do the following three things with the spirit of donating school funding last year: Save money yourself and ask your parents to donate; Donate old books you have read; Tell out-of-school children in the neighborhood to enroll. But our parents are all very poor, and many students rely on student aid to afford books. Finally, after two days of hard work, we, the entire fourth-grade class, managed to collect 5,000 yuan. Mr. Miao also donated 1,000 yuan, totaling 60 yuan. In addition, we have 95 old books. The remaining 215 books were jointly donated by students in the sixth grade.'"</p>
<p>In addition, we deeply appreciate the donation of 100 copies of covenant books from all the male students of Class A in the fifth grade of Renzhi Primary School, and 300 old books, half a dozen exercise books, and ten pencils from all the teachers and students of Peiming Primary School.</p>
<h3>Yongnian Tai Chi Class – First Session Ends</h3>
<p>In order to promote physical education and develop national martial arts, our organization established a Hui Zhong Fitness Class on October 1st of last year, temporarily setting up a Yongnian Tai Chi group. We invited Mr. Chuan Zhongwen, nephew of the modern Tai Chi master, Yongnian Yang Chengfu, to serve as a volunteer instructor. Since the beginning of the class, for a period of six months, the first session was completed at the end of March. In addition to the old students continuing to practice for further improvement, the second session will soon begin enrollment. Mr. Chuan has been re-invited to teach voluntarily. Registration forms are currently being printed, and we will announce them as soon as they are ready. The location will still be the courtyard of the Zhong Jiao Daoyi Association on Nantu Road, Zhanyuli, and it is completely free.</p>
<p>Low-Price Market Opens Today</p>
<p>In view of the rising cost of living and the difficult lives of ordinary poor students in the city, the YMCA of Shanghai will hold a low-price market at the YMCA of Baxianqiao on April 2nd, 3rd, and 4th. All proceeds will be used to fund worker lectures. All the goods will be transferred from the relief market for dropouts that is sponsored by four organizations, so the prices are especially low. Special preferential tickets are issued, each sold for 500 yuan, but 600 yuan worth of goods can be purchased. They are already on sale at the YMCA information desk.</p>
<h3>X-Ray Check-Up Privileges for the Education Sector</h3>
<p>The China Health Association has initiated X-ray defense check-ups. According to current fees, each film requires 1,400 yuan. However, in order to provide preferential treatment to the education sector, the old price is still halved to make it more popular. These check-up tickets will only be effective with the school's affiliated seal. The ticket fee can be paid when attending the check-up, saving procedures. However, this service method is limited to only one month, until the end of April this year, and will not be continued in order to end the program. We hope that the education sector will not miss this preferential opportunity.</p>
<p>Free Dental Treatment from the Director of the China Dental Protection Institute, Ying Yongfeng wrote: "In previous Children's Days, our hospital provided free treatment for children's dental diseases. This year, we will still uphold our original intention and provide free diagnosis and treatment of dental diseases from April 1st to 10th for those with "Residential Certificates." No registration fee will be charged. Address: Ningbo Road, Jiangxi Road, Dinhongda Heng Building, 3rd Floor."</p>
