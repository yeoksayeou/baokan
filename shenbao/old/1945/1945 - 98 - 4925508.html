<h3>日內閣改組　方針不變</h3>
<p>中央訊　日小磯首相去年七月二十二日繼東條內閣之後組閣以來，應付嚴重戰局，處理國政，經此八月半後，今委國政於鈴木大將之手，提出總辭職。</p>
<p>在敵美自琉島再接近冲繩島之今日，對於日本內閣之改組，英美蘇渝加以種種臆測，或幻想此為日本敗北之更進一步。而表極度欣喜。然日本內閣之改組，與其他各國之改組內閣，其旨趣完全不相同，日本應循路徑已昭示於宣戰詔書，此項方針雖經內閣幾度改組，亦不稍變動，唯有採取更有效的方法，向此目標前進。</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭開好以來，日本內閣三次改組，東條內閣爲謀東亞之安定興求自存自衛，毅然對英美開戰，自開戰以來，努力整頓國內戰時態勢，終於完成使命。去年七月爲使人心一新，完成戰爭起見，以內閣有領讓與小磯首相，小磯首相以「大和一致」爲口號，確立應付戰局之國民總蹶起體制。</p>
<p>小磯首相在任時，實施創設最高戰爭指導會議，首相出席大本營會議，使軍管區與地方協議會切合一致等政策，使國政　亦即確立舉一億國民參加作戰之體制，使國民士氣更爲激揚，同時增强軍需生產，完密配置國民義勇隊等，亦均完成任務。</p>
<p>日國內期待今後對全國人民發施號令，領導決戰到底之內閣出現，是以小磯首相在此希望下提出總辭職，現在日本國民敵愾心理更爲激昂，決意戰至最後一人，不減英美不止，此可謂小磯內閣施策之進步。</p>
<p>將任新首相之鈴木　太郎海軍大將，現任樞密院議長，為重臣中之重臣，在其以十四年之海軍生活中，歷任海軍次官，第二，第三艦隊司令長官，聯合艦隊司令長官，海軍軍令部長等要職，爲日本海軍界元老之一人。昭和四年退役任待從長，去年八月　樞府議長，今年已七十九歲，當時淸戰爭時，率水雷戰隊突入威海衛灣內，勇猛威武，向受人欽佩，目下在此決戰時期，將領導一億人民，發施號令。</p>
<p>目前日本人民所望於政府者，爲使政治集中於決戰，使統帥與國民緊密切合，將國家總力發揮至最高限度。其一部份階段巳由小磯內閣完成，鈴木內閣將繼起强力推進，領導人民奮起實行總突繫　，一切決戰施策將飛躍進展，而擊減敵人之全國一致決戰，亦將迅速展開。</p>
<h3>小日山總裁　今日飛東京</h3>
<p>新京七日中央社電　滿鐵總載小日山氏，因鈴木貫太郎之電邀，決定八日乘機飛東京。</p>
<h3>兩月來的菲島戰况</h3>
<p>我們（每日新聞小島及齋確兩特派員）回到台灣來，在心坎上仍然浮現着我們陸海軍守備隊的戰士雄姿，每天據守着化爲廢墟的舊馬尼刺城，冒着敵機不斷的轟炸，以及每天一萬餘顆的巨大砲彈，向躲藏在火燄噴射器後面的美軍，實行壯烈的衝鋒，而不斷收獲偉大戰果。我們此次由於作戰上的必要，而實行調防，〇月〇日，由馬尼刺北上，我們自晝伏臥在野地上，睡眠在山裹，一到夜晚，則有時用卡車，有時徒步。要繼續一千公里以上的夜行軍，與皇軍兵士備嘗辛苦。現在我們兩人終於回到台灣來了。呂宋島戰棧上，皇軍到處施展着凄慘壯絕的衝鋒拿手好戲，使敵美遭受着無限的損失，現在敵方死傷業已達到七萬多了。正式的消耗戰，尚在後面。在敵機的耀武揚威下，日軍將士絕對信賴山下將軍的剝皮折骨，斬草除根之「山下戰法」。士氣非常旺盛，都認爲「正式的兵力消耗戰還在後面」。我想報告一下敵美在仁牙因登陸以來，兩個月在北方戰綫上親身所體騐的呂宋作戰實况。</p>
<p>在呂宋島作戰上所看到的顯著事實，就長協助邀擊敵人的陸軍之日本空軍，曾不斷地出現。我們在防空洞中看着敵機，而曾想過數次，認爲呂宋戰塲上假如再有更多的飛機，「則定會打得美國鬼子屁滾水流」，敵機一看見地上縱有一個日本兵·甚至一輛卡車，都要衡上前來，反復施以掃射。我們日本足够　耀世界的具有重裝備之坦克軍隊，想衝入敵陣，拼個「你死我活」，也因此受了相當牽制。敵人的坦克車，每輛有三架掩護機像天鷹一樣保護着坦克飾進。當敵美在仁牙因登陸時，總見集團攻擊法，以四架為一單位，二十架，三十架，五十架這樣機羣，在呂宋上空總是每天竟達一千架以上擾亂我們。最初美國會是以B24型和B25型中級轟炸機，P47型戰鬥機爲主。但在仁牙因用運輸船陸續登陸時，P40型，P51型，P39型等艦战機，也出動了。這種艦战機，像魔鬼一樣殘暴地集中轟炸了加已那贊，桑赫塞，塔爾拉克等呂宋島的中部主要都市，完全化爲一片焦土，炸傷了很多菲律賓人。敵機縱然辨別出是我們的病院及救護隊，仍然也施行低空轟炸，這可以說是殘無人道了。</p>
<p>雖然呂宋島上美機這樣猖獗，但我們日本士兵毫不氣餒，反而消耗了敵人無數的兵力。如果拿日本軍隊的特別壯烈衝鋒戰術來劃分菲島決戰和雷伊泰作戰的話，雷伊泰作戰的主角，曾是空軍的特別攻擊隊；但日本飛機大感不足的呂宋島戰塲上之主角，却是壯烈無比的地上衝鋒隊。特別攻擊隊是用自己的飛機撞拼敵船，地上衝鋒隊與此相同，在呂宋島戰綫上，日本的將士全都成爲地上特別攻擊隊了。他們向敵陣衝鋒，强使敵人消耗最大的兵力。敵人所最怕者，就是皇軍給他們的人力損失。所以呂宋戰塲上我們日本兵士，雖然沒有飛機幫助地上部隊，但沒有一個悲觀者。地上的勇士們說：「雷伊泰作戰時，日本空軍曾堅持奮鬥過，現在輪班該是我們陸軍衝鋒了。」士兵是這樣微笑着堅信日本的勝利。</p>
<p>呂宋島的皇軍，眼看着美軍在呂宋島登陸，而展開大胆的戰法。在馬尼刺東部地帶，克拉科地帶，呂宋北部等三戰略區內，會在美軍無法迅速追擊的實行撤退而縮短戰綫。這就是山下將軍非常自信的消耗兵力戰法。當時我們聽到某部隊長豪語壯言說：「在呂宋作戰是用不着飛機的」，我們不敢　加信賴。但到如今，我們才深深瞭解部美部隊長的意思，</p>
<p>美軍在仁牙因登陸不久，在北部戰綫某基地指揮呂宋作戰的A部隊長，也曾就道一作戰的深長意義對我說過：「敵人只耍進入馬尼刺，或克拉科，就會成爲　中之鼇」。這樣像謎般的話，現在果然實現，進入馬尼刺的美國軍隊，被我們英勇善鬥的皇軍，多半都殺得一亁二凈。美國侵入的馬尼刺，現在被他們到處放火，到處掠奪，以及砲轟彈炸，早巳完全化爲一片焦士瓦礫了，在黑暗的街頭巷尾，無家可歸，呼飢號寒的，有數十萬馬尼刺市民。當克拉科地區，敵人開始使用飛機塲時，在附近山林內被包閣的皇軍將士，就放射巨砲，並實行衝鋒，以妨碍其使用飛機塲。敵方又改變戰略，捲土重來時，則只有更大的兵力損失。最近呂宋各個戰塲上，敵人都在前進，而展開了彼此劇烈的攻防戰，這是敵人中了我們計策所致。呂宋島各綫上的日本將士，認爲「盡可能多殺美國鬼子，就是五年戰爭或十年戰爭，也要堅持下去」，都這樣燃燒着壯烈無比的戰鬥情緖。</p>
<p>在北部戰綫上奮鬥的日本將士，在山岳地帶建築起難攻易守的千旱城，以保證畏期戰的可能，以充分的自信，準備好以戰養戰的陣勢，我所訪問的某一部隊，會保存着準備好一整年的木炭，真令人佩服。據說，用木柴作飯往往會被敵機發見，所以老早就準備好了木炭。該部隊中的勇士們，在公餘之暇即種南瓜，茄子，蘿蔔等，這才是長期戰態勢。</p>
<p>呂宋島的日本平民，在北部戰綫的要衝，〇〇溪谷某地，對於軍隊作戰絕對信賴，甚至婦孺老　都帮助軍隊，進行作戰，真所謂軍民一體。就是說，日本居民在軍隊的指揮下，整備戰鬥的自足自給生活，組成生活物資生產隊，生活物資搜集隊，工業自活班等。生產隊從事於割稻，軋米，種植等；搜集隊牽着水牛從事於收買物資。由此觀之，目前的菲島戰綫，上至山下將軍下至婦孺，完全打成一片，爲爭取勝利而努力奮鬥着。（林譯自三月十五日每日新聞）</p>
<h3>决與盟邦協力共求解放目標</h3>
<p>—陳代主席發表談話—</p>
<p>南京七日中央社電　陳代主席今日發表談話稱：小磯內閣總理大臣因鑒於戰局日趨嚴重，希望有更有强力之內閣出現，自請辭職，現已決定由鈴本大將繼續出任組閣。吾人對於小磯內閣之勞績，固深致無限之敬佩，對於新任內閣尤寄予莫大之期待。憶小磯內閣於去秋成立之初，時當敵美反攻日趨熾烈，小磯首相以必勝之信念，喚起日本民族決鬥之精神，以堅强之決意，實行政略戰略之統一，對國政之推行，戰力之强化，盡最大之努力，故於台菲及硫黃島歷次戰役，收獲赫赫戰果，特攻隊之突擊，尤是表現勇敢無畏之精神，日本民族保繼東亞及其國土，已具有百折不撓之決心。本人去冬訪日，曾與小磯首相交換意見，深知此次戰爭，如不能獲勝利，東亞之解放將永無實現之日。中日兩國利害安危已不可分，時局無諭如何緊迫，國民政府必本堅決信念，與盟邦協力，共求解放。此次日本內聞雖有更迭，對於完遂戰爭之目標初無二致。鈴木大將爲海軍耆宿，曾任聯合艦隊司令長官，現任樞密院議長，固爲戰略之權威，尤有行政之卓越手腕，參加組閣人員亦均爲日本軍政界之重鎮，本人深信新內閣必能以更堅强之陣容，推行國政之施策，遂行決戰。國民政府本於共求解放之目標·自當繼承汪先生遺志，以同生共死之決心，貫澈參戰初衷，努力邁進，以　大東亞戰爭之完遂。</p>

<p>星期評論</p>
<h3>舊金山會議的透視</h3>
<p>— 金松生</p>
<p>反軸心國誇大宣傳中的舊金山會議，距開幕之期，已不足三星期。據最近海外電訊，可見反軸心國在此會議之前，又有勾心鬥角的新演出，因此使我們對於舊金山會議成果的懷疑，更爲堅定，並有進一唇加以揭發的必要。</p>
<p>首先，必須了解，這次會議，雖然號稱參加國家達四十餘國，如土耳其，伊朗，叙利亞，黎巴嫩，以及中南美各國，且會爲欲參加這次會議而對德日兩國宣戰；但是，主要邀請國只有美英蘇三國，都　然以未來國際聯盟的盟主自居，希望執此次舊金山會議的牛耳，即特戈爾領導下的法國臨時政府，尚因鑒於此種形勢而宣布不參加邀請國之列，其他各國將來在會議中的地位，更可想而知。反軸心國的情報宣傳方法，雖然已由一丸四二年冬的莫斯科「四强」宣言，改爲「五强」之說，但是實際上有如岸情報部長「幻夢一般的舊金山會議」一文中所指出，特戈爾統治下的法國，只是英美的私生子，在未來國際會議上決無自中發言的地位；即以重慶而論，雖然久已以「四强之一」自居，然而木身問題太多，渝共磨擦不已，因此在國際會議上也不能不居於被動地位，未能和美英蘇三國並列。所以這次會議，顯然只是美英蘇三大主角領班的悲喜劇而已。什麼戰後和平與安全保障的全世界國際組織，只不過是這三大中角一手包辦自私自利的工具而已。</p>
<p>其次，魷最近形勢的趨向而觀，道三大中角之問的矛盾對立，巳日趨白熱化了。最明顯的是波蘭出席問題和投票問題。蘇聯因爲鑒於英美野心別抱，對於克里米亞會議之產物的舊金山會議，已經表示冷淡的態度，他和英美之興高采烈相反，在國內外的情報及輿論機關都表示冷靜；他又不顧各國出席舊金山會議的代表團陣容如何堅强，只派出一批在英美眼光中認爲「不够格」的外交官，聊以敷衍。而關於波籣問題，他又發表了衡動性的聲明，支持華沙的波蘭臨時政府必須有出席會議之權；關於投票問題，他又爭取了一國三票的特權。但是英美除了承認蘇聯的島克蘭和白俄羅斯兩國各有一投票權之外，對於波蘭出席一節已加以拒絕，而英美輿論已發現指摘蘇聯態度的文章了。由於這三大主角之問的對立日趨嚴重，所以外電已有舊金山會議將延期至今夏召開的消息，而美國亦已建議五强在舊金山會議之前，先行在華盛頓召開會議。這裏更反證了三大主角之間矛盾的深刻化。</p>
<p>舊金山會議的意義，充其量也不過是在美英蘇三國主導之下，裝造出一個以三國的武力爲基礎的新國際聯盟，而置羣小國於附庸的地位，以聯合壓制東西軸心國。由於三國間矛盾的日趨銳化，他們這種野心之現實性已很可懷疑，而世界紛爭的危機却是必然的趨勢。所以，誠如日本大使館岸情報部長所說：「將於四月二十五日誇稱爲確立世界和平而在舊金山召開之會議，不過爲戰爭之繼續而已。」</p>
<h3>冲繩周圍敵艦船續擊沉毀廿一艘　大山一帶正展開邀擊戰</h3>
<p>日大本營發表</p>
<p>東京七日中央社電　日大本營七日下午四時發表：　冲繩本島之敵軍，本月六日於有力戰車及艦砲之掩護下，進抵大山宜野灣，新垣各南側一帶，該地日軍守備各部隊，現正展開邀繫戰中。　日航空部隊及永上部隊，繼續政擊冲繩本島周圍之敵艦船，於四月一日至五日，所獲戰果中判明者如次：擊沉巡洋艦一艘，巡洋艦或驅逐艦五艘，艦型不明者二艘，驅逐艦一艘，輸送船二艘。擊毀航空母艦一艘，巡洋艦或驅逐艦二艘，艦型不明者二艘，輸送船五艘。</p>
<p>東京七日中央社電　日陸海軍特別攻擊隊，自六日晨起，終日對冲繩本島附近之敵艦船羣發動大規模之攻擊，由該島得見被轟沉之各種敵艦船十四艘及擊沉燃爐之十一艘敵艦，此外並有十一處焚燒，因此，敵艦船羣乃陷於大混亂狀態中。</p>
<p>東京七日中央社電　日航空部隊於六日夜起，猛烈攻擊冲繩本島四周敵艦艇及機動部隊，本島四周之敵艦艇中，有戰艦，巡洋艦等多艘受重大打擊，敵機動部隊中有航空母艦三艘以上被擊沉或擊毀，敵艦隊已陷入大混亂狀態。</p>
<p>中部太平洋日軍基地七日中央社電　五日晝間，少數敵艦艇羣曾接近冲水良部島，久米島·奄美大島等施以砲擊，日軍守備部隊當即與之交戰，將共擊退。又是日冲繩本島中部東岸之中城灣，侵入敵艦船巡洋艦及驅逐艦等數艘，實行艦砲射擊，即爲日守軍擊退。</p>
<p>日陸海特攻隊不分晝夜猛攻</p>
<p>東京七日中央社電　以戰艦爲中心，擁有巡洋艦，驅遂艦等一百艘左右之美有力艦隊，仍近迫冲繩本島東西兩側，繼續艦砲射擊，而敵小型艦艇羣，亦出沒於琉球軍島，而在本島南方及西方，更有輸送船團一百數十艘進弋，此外尚有包含英艦隊之有力機動部隊，依然在該島海面活動，因此可知美國舉其全力於冲繩作戰，乃企圖奪取該島附近之制海權也。茲日陸海軍之精銳，皆爲特攻隊員，不分畫夜，加以猛攻，刻正擴大戰果中。據大本營登表，自一日以來載至五日止，其間日航空部隊及水上部隊所獲戰果中，除業經發表外，其後又獲擊沉或擊毀美艦船二十一艘之戰果，而　三月二十三日以來，綜合戰果已達擊沉或擊毀共計二百十一艘之龐大數目，如斯，該海面之血鬥，益趨激烈化，而戰局之推移，依然不許逆睹也。</p>
<h3>宿務島壯烈激戰日軍擴大戰果中</h3>
<p>菲島前綫七日中央社電　宿務當日陸，海軍守備隊與空軍協力下，繼續對敵展開壯烈激戰，現正擴大戰果中。宿務正面之敵兵力約有五個師團，在宿務海上活動之敵艦船約入十艘，日航空部隊二十七日會以大型機五架掩護地上部隊，於淺　附近用高角砲向敵方猛射，使敵陷於大混亂。二日敵曾以配備戰車八十輛，野砲七門，迫擊砲二門之有力部隊，向日陸軍部隊正面來襲，計殺傷敵兵七百二十名，擊毀戰車三輛，焚毀兵營四處·日海軍部隊亦於猛烈之砲火掩護下，對來襲之敵軍三百名實行殲減作戰，到處獲致戰果，於呂宋東南海面加斯比附近登陸之敵軍，一日以有力部隊侵入日軍守備部隊陣地，但遭擊退，迄二日止所獲戰果，計殺傷敵兵員五百餘名，擊毀大砲戰車二輛，獲其他兵器甚多。</p>
<p>中部太平洋基地七日中央社電　日航空部隊於三日起六日拂曉止，數度猛攻航行硫黃列島附近海域之敵海上有力部隊，現經判明戰果如次：以魚雷擊中戰艦，巡洋艦等大型艦數艘，運轍船一艘起火，又擊沉其艦型不詳者一艘，與敵打繫甚大，現仍在繼續攻擊中。</p>
<h3>敵機昨分襲　東京名古屋</h3>
<p>東京七日中央社電　日大本營七日下午五時發表：南方基地之敵航空部隊，於七日上午以飛機約一百二十架來襲東京附近，同時幷以一百五十架左右來變名十屋附近，至各地戰果及被害情况，現正調査中。</p>
<h3>日蘇條約廢止　滿不受影響</h3>
<p>新京七日中央社電　關於蘇聯對日蘇中立條約之措置，滿國外部大臣六日對記者團發表談話如次：日蘇中立條約不繼續之通告，聞自蘇聯發出，滿蘇關係近年頗爲平靜，最近各種懸案亦正逐次圓滿解決，故此次措置對於滿洲國並無影響。</p>
<h3>陳代主席　電謝滿皇</h3>
<p>南京七日中央社電　國府還都五週年紀念日，滿洲國皇帝曾致電國府陳代主席祝賀，茲悉陳代主席亦於日昨復電致謝。</p>

<h3>東亞人全體協力　爭取自由獨立</h3>
<p>滿洲國大使李紹庚，最近爲作蒞任後首次拜會上海中日各當局首腦，特於日前專程由京抵滬。昨日下午二時，特偕同中山優公使，假南京路外灘華懋飯店九樓，接見本市中日各報社記者，並到有伊武官少將，伊藤參事官，竹之內參事官，傅秘書官等，總領事館計到總領事葉堯公，事務官玉聞精一，及各報社記者等不下二十餘名。首由李大使發表蒞任後感想，及滿洲建國十三年之一切建設情形。並望中日滿三國今後應作更進一步之密切提携，完成大東亞最後勝利。旋又答　記者團所提出之各項問題，至三時半始畢。</p>
<p>中滿兩國密切聯繫</p>
<p>李大使首謂：「本人自蒞華後，猶首次抵滬，向各方邦會。上海爲中國最重要之都市，亦爲東亞重要之一隅，故今後與各方之聯繫，尤須密切。本人自蒞華後，渴望早日來滬一行，乃因蒞任伊始，公務忙碌，直至二月後之今日，方始抵滬與諸君會見，實深表歉意。日來本人在滬與中國各機關這首腦，及日本軍方而多有所懇談，荷承各方均對今後之滿洲國，表示深切之援助，在中滿之提携上，亟盼上海有更進一步之協力，今旣承美滿之協助，本人引爲深感愉快。滿洲建國十數年來，一切建設雖未有理想之上軌道，在大體上確有進步，此點實由於日滿兩國緊密合作之結果。同時並承中國之協力匪淺，尤其華北當局之協助，故今後希望中滿兩國作更進一步之密切聯繫，以及中日滿三國之緊密提携，滿洲國已充分努力，而新中國當亦特別努力。本人在南京時與貴國政府作多次之懇談，更見對大東亞戰爭之實獻，有極大之努力。現在中國由於種種之關係，至今猶未能展開全面和平之實現，但國民政府之努力精神及官民之熟誠，打成一片，實不亞於滿洲國，其能途至爲樂觀。</p>
<p>東亞復興足禦外侮</p>
<p>當今戰爭日形緊張，大東亞民族應全體動員努力，則不難克服艱困，東亞民族整個之復興，力量之巨，足能抵禦外來侵略。過去東亞各國，歴受西洋之壓迫，故要求東亞之自由獨立，此乃東亞人本身之責任，不論中國國民政府之和平，及重慶之「抗戰」，滿洲國之獨立，以及菲泰緬印等各國之相繼獨立，其原因實由於數百年來受盡白種人之壓迫。當今我黃色人種，返應打開的新的局面，我人要求自由獨立，當應奮起改造局面，爭取與西洋人同等的自强，天賦我人之自由權力，在今日要更强烈之奮鬥，達到最後目的，完成最大目標，則我人必須全體協力，謀取獨立，與西洋人抗衡。關於日本領導建設東亞，有人以爲日本有侵略東亞野心，加以懷疑，其性質與西洋人雷同，本人力可保證，絕對非是，可將日本協力建設滿洲國而　，則此項疑雲巳完全打消，決無侵略野心。如今不但使滿洲國政治上軌，國內一切建設突飛猛晉，如日滿兩國之經濟合作，開發產業，在相互扶助上，協力投資頗大。</p>
<p>一致團結前途光明</p>
<p>如萬一此次戰爭敵人有利，不論中國以及東亞任何民族，特來欲謀取平等，其困難當更甚。至西洋國家觀念，衹顧本身利益打算，決不爲東亞人設想，東亞人民木具賦厚道德之民族，爲朋友者僅日本一國，最近舊金山會議誘使重慶出席，此乃甘言欺騙，今後頗為危險，英美拉攏重慶乃破壞東亞大集團。如十億民族之大團結，向白種人抗衛，決無問題。如果東亞民族遭受們別擊破，東亞前途當爲危岌，應亟切明暸，挽回危機。我人以英美蘇三國而觀，彼此同床異夢，各謀本人利益，雖如今利用重慶，乃假用中國人的資源，其結果終遭犧牲，富初日美戰等來發生前，美國盡量將物資援助日本，一面欺驅中國，希望　蚌相爭，漁翁得利，故重慶亟應反省，爲東亞整個民族着想才是，不應自相殘殺，而滿洲等國以來，日本對滿之認識頗甚，滿洲對日本之大和民族亦極明瞭，歴年膚切協力，成爲良好之友邦，日本真誠道義精神，實可欽佩，甚望大家一致團結，實有光明燦爛前途。</p>

<h3>記者例會提出　縣政改進問題　縣政管理處譚副處長解答</h3>
<p>市宣傳處主持之第十一次記者例會，昨（七）日下午二時半假市府會議室舉行，到各報社記者十餘人，先由劉處長介紹本市縣政管理處新任處長蔡　舜，及副處長譚庶潛後，嗣由譚副處長答覆各報社記者所提各項問題，歷一時餘始畢。茲誌各情於後：</p>
<p>施政情形</p>
<p>（問）縣政管理處最近施政情形如何？（答）本處於三月一日成立後，　前兼處長對於各縣區行政改進，至爲關心，　經擬具「强化縣政綱要」準備實施，其中對於各縣機構之調整，人事之整頓，行文效率之促進，以及民政·財政·建設·敎育·治安等項政務之改進，均有具體提示。例如縣政工作人員待遇之提高，區長及佐治人員之訓練，整飭官紀，厲行廉潔政治，田賦改征實物，取締不決錢莊票據，修建道路橋樑，設置農事試騐塲，增加生產，設置縣立醫院或診療所，增設鄉村小學，訓練警察及自警團，增强人民目衛力量等等，均在計劃才中。現此項綱要已呈市政府核示中，一俟核准，即行令　各縣政府遵照實施。此外本處爲强化各縣區治安，會於三月二十二日召集各縣縣長區公署長，開治安談話會一次，對於縣區治安確保問題，亦有所決定。惟本處成立伊始，僅先以調查地方情形，擬訂縣政改進方針，增進縣區行政效率爲施政重點。</p>
<p>增產運動</p>
<p>（問）各縣增產運動是否在進行，以何種產品爲重點？（答）本市各縣對於增產工作，向即重視，並均設有農業增產策進委員會負責推進，同時各縣合作社，亦復盡力協助，其增產重點，爲稻與棉，最近本處更以蔬菜增產，列爲各縣增產重點，幷有具體實施計劃，預料本年度將有較大收穫。</p>
<p>嚴厲禁賭</p>
<p>（問）郊區各鄕鎭賭風甚熾，貴處有無澈底取締辦法？（答）關於本巿郊區賭風，本處於成立後，即接獲報告，尤其南匯縣之周浦新塲大圍一帶爲甚，幷獲悉有奸狡之徒，組織所謂「銀團」，發出一種非法「申單」，以代練碼，以致無知農民，致遭傾家蕩產者時有所聞。本處獲得確息後，當即嚴令南　及川沙兩縣政府，切實查禁，幷將主要份子查明報處懲辦，此後對於各縣區賭風，如再復熾，自必澈底加以取締，切稍姑息。</p>
<p>整飭警紀</p>
<p>（問）盛傳各縣警察紀律欠佳，時有勒索情事發生，其真相究竟如何？（答）本市各縣警察，過去待遇極低，例如南匯川沙警士待遇，月給不過九十元，崇明奉賢嘉定警士待遇蛟高，然月給亦不過九百元左右，勒索之事，勢所不免，警務業經劃歸本處主管，對於警紀整飭，自予以特別重視，倘各方面如有具體事實檢舉，本處定必依法懲處。羅前兼處長爲澈底整飭警紀外，曾擬定提高警察待遇，期與保安隊相等，是項擬定，已呈市政府核示，一俟核准，即行實施，諒新待遇實施後，此種不良現象，可望減少。</p>

<h3>巿經液濟局嚴究　冒充調査員</h3>
<p>市經濟局對於工商業申請登記事宜，必須派員調查確實，方准核發領照營業，所有外勤人員調查任務，監督尤爲嚴格，凡舉派出勤人員執行職務時，除佩帶職員證章外，幷執有特發之黃色出勤證。詎於上月廿七日自稱經濟局職員王益鳴者，向松潘路一一二號朱茂盛麵店調查，索取手續費三千五百元，允提早核發登記證，不料當日該局所派之視察員執憑出動證前往調查時，該店方知受愚，該局視察員當即返局報告派員密查究辦，幷一面怖告各商民知照，倘有該局出動人員前往調查，如不能出示出勤證者應即拒絕調查，以免受愚。</p>

<h3>泰山警察分局　嚴密防範盜匪　轄境四週遍設竹籬</h3>
<p>泰山警察分局因鑒於該區地處全市中心，爲前法租界最繁鬧之區，且娛榮塲所林立，來往之人良秀不齊，且於全市合併後，所有昆　南市之鐵門全部開放，竊犯逃軍較易，近三四月來竊案層出不已，該分局爲强化警務，迭經籌商防過對策，以戢盜風。故經商得保甲方面同意合作，於轄境四週遍設竹籬，里巷鐵門準時關閉，幷於各娛樂塲所密佈警探。一遇盜刦，全區各路口同時封閉，同時警探人員不時實施捕盜訓練，以密防範，而戢盜風，幷望市民協力維持地方治安。</p>

<h3>自上海到合肥</h3>

<p>千等萬等，總算等到車票。上車前舖蓋打行李票，箱子則寗願勞力傷財，隨身携帶，以防遺失。因係夜車，於翌晨五時抵南京下關，下車後，急須等待行李，藍票可聯用而行李不可聯運，而且須趕上午九時津浦急行車，故心急如煎。苦等至入時半，俄而警報大作，一時下關車站，頓成空巷。筆者雇車躲於中山橋下，因河中永乾，橋基堅固，頗宣作避雜所也。</p>
<p>俟警報解除，再取行李，渡江，九時已過，所幸列車誤點，尚能趕及。渡江搬行李之紅帽子費，說來駭人，先後四次，計費六千元。加上逃警報車費二千元，可抵一張上海至蚌埠之快車票有餘，此十分鐘之江面竟須如此破費，誠出人意料，且檢查嚴密。華鐵當局如能許可行李聯運，則旅客不便定可減少。此點自輕而易舉，蓋渡江之行李，事實上終必渡江也。</p>
<p>津浦急行車原定上午九時自浦口開出，不意誤點至下午九點。其間又二度逢空襲警報，因有行李在身，而無黃包車可顧，祇能聽天由命。</p>
<p>津浦車之擠，尤甚於京滬車，此日因有日僑婦孺經過，車輛減少，擁擠不堪言狀。車廂內空氣之惡劣，無以復加、嘔吐暈眩者發生多起，至於上下東在肩上爬行，司空見慣，婦孺大哭小號，學吵之聲不絕。車行之慢，不可思議，計自浦口至蚌埠，費十一小時，而規定時間僅四小時耳。</p>
<p>至蚌後首感驚訝者，即食物之低廉是也。此地米每擔三萬五，旦爲大斗，麵粉一百二十元一斤，雞蛋百元三只，牛肉一百八十元一斤。大餅油條，每付六十元，油條之大，直徑二英吋，長可十四英吋，大餅亦「大」，厚且結實。較上海者不啻大巫見小巫也。</p>
<p>在蚌　車赴水家湖，此路擠况較好，惟多　　單帮。水家湖在淮南綫未改道前，本爲小站，自去年改向與蚌埠卸接後，舊路即拆至此爲止，再自此地起作新路，故赴合肥者必以此地爲經禍站。往合肥之汽車路，爲鐵道拆除後之舊淮南綫改築，故路面甚狹，二車不能相並。汽車每晨九時一班，要價奇昂，一百入十里竟而七千元。與蚌至水火車票五百元者比較，誠使人吃驚。是故跑　單帮皆挑担經路，絡繹於途。車抵合肥，已午後四時矣。</p>

<h3>偉大的戰略家　山下大將</h3>
<p>— 池田源治</p>
<p>目前在菲律賓整個戰塲上，　軍在實行壯烈的肉搏衝鋒虞，收獲到殺傷敵人達七萬人以上的大戰果，而使敵人深陷於苦悶的泥沼裏。大東亞戰爭開始期間，由於新加城攻略戰，才能領教到「猛烈果敵的山下攻勢」，但是一般人尚不大知道，這位猛將的「强勒防　山下戰略」。</p>
<p>「防禦山下戰略」究竟是怎麼一回事呢？為了要知這這個，首先得知道這位將軍的生平和性格——將軍沒有子女，當他在滿州的時候，就把當地的少年們，當作自己孩子一樣地歡喜，並且敎他們用功的方法說：「你們眞是用功的孩子呵，努力豫習就够了，不必一定要複習的」。在也是他目小學而幼年學校，而陸軍士官學校，而陸軍大學，身體力行的規則。</p>
<p>「打仗是不能修改的。所以在打仗之前最要緊的是充分豫習」。</p>
<p>這就是將軍在少年時的一種見解。具有這種見解和這種信念的他，自從當靑年將校時起，一直到當將軍時止，從來就沒有修改過，也從來沒有失敗過。</p>
<p>山下柔軟戰略</p>
<p>在中國戰綫上，無論當兵團長時，或是當軍幕僚長時？他所勇敢執行的戰略，就總是戰勝敵人的「山下戰略」。他在軍部內時也都被人稱贊作一種新的戰略家。</p>
<p>從前，將軍當華北兵團長時，記者會打聰過他對於中國事變的意見，那時將軍搖榥着他魁偉的身驅說：</p>
<p>「且先看看中國人吧！他們在兵荒馬亂之中，縱然受人攻打，縱然一敗再敗，但却不驚慌失惜，我們日本人也應該鎮靜和沈着，不要太神經過敏。」</p>
<p>後來，他率領一個兵團，衝入廣漠無垠的中國腹部，親自體騐到對中國大陸的進攻，同時也會詳詳細細地研究過吸收日本軍於腹中的中國戰略。</p>
<p>這次呂宋島作戰，當敵軍侵入呂宋平原時，而他就非常鎮靜而微笑地說：「敵軍已經成爲我們的腹中物了。」在呂宋登陸的敵軍，進入精强日本軍險的腹中，自然他在心中暗暗地微笑，認爲敵人將繼續不斷地陷於艱苦作戰了。敵軍在仁牙因登陸以來，並沒碰到豫期的抵抗，而傳　山倒海的浪潮一樣，一直的南下追擊日軍。敵人爲進攻馬尼刺，竟損失了全部登陸軍的三分之一，而日軍主力却無絲毫損傷。麥克渥塞乘雷伊泰勝利之勢，想直搗呂宋島，不想上了「山下戰略」的大當。恐怕他們還會上咎由自取的大當吧！</p>
<p>片言驚倒戈林</p>
<p>山下將軍不僅是日本手屈一指的戰略家，實際上也是世界著名的偉大戰略家。將軍在這次世界大戰的第二年·即一九四〇年末，應穗意兩國之邀，會詳細視察西綫的新戰塲。當時集合德國震撼全世界的精銳機械化部隊於一地，讓山下將軍檢閱後，戈林元帥會拍着將軍的肩膀說：</p>
<p>「閣下的感想如何？……？</p>
<p>將軍才回頭看看機械化部隊的大兵團。於是不在意的回答說：</p>
<p>「呵，並非像所預期的那樣好。」</p>
<p>戈林元帥竟被將軍這種偉大的氣魄所驚倒，於是便說：</p>
<p>「那末就和日本軍隊比較一下吧！」</p>
<p>「好的，你的話正合我意，那末就在伊朗高原，或阿富汗一帶決一雌雄吧！」</p>
<p>「哈！哈！哈！……」</p>
<p>於是這兩們英雄就相抱而笑。</p>
<p>將軍視察德意戰綫歸來以後，在當新加坡攻略軍最高指揮以前的期間，不斷實地研究擊減高度機械化部隊的戰略，終於發明了所謂「山下柔軟戰略」。</p>
<p>殲滅戰之等待</p>
<p>近來將軍在研究一種戰略，就是用有限的裝備，有限的兵員和資材，來粉碎擁有數千輛坦克車和數千架飛機的高度機械化部隊。所以這個戰略，並遺憾者。就是一部的制空權暫時操於敵人之手，然而數目上佔饉勢的敵人，業已遭受我們的打擊，以致損失達七萬人之多，而我主力軍却未受絲毫損害，這就是山下戰法的成功</p>
<p>具有熱列戰鬥精神和堅決自信的將軍，時機一到，必定會展開一大殲滅戰，這就是將軍不折不撓的性格。</p>
<p>然而這一巨大的殲減戰將在何時展開？那就是焦急萬分的敵人，今後即將展開本土登陸作戰，他們的補充陷於困難的時候，敵我戰力的均衡再陷於破裂的時候，就是巨大殲減戰展開的時候。</p>
<p>現在敵軍的船舶，已經不足。他們焦急於速戰速決，希望在各處强行登陸的時候，敵人的補充業已缺乏，敵人的戰鬥力業已削弱，這是人所共曉的。這就是菲律賓敵我戰力的均衡發生破裂的時候，也就是山下軍隊展開大殲滅戰的最好機會。</p>
<p>無論在台灣，也無論在中國，在華南，甚至將來在日本，敵人如進一步，則總會用令人叫古運天的「山下柔軟戰略」，使之付出最大的血肉代價。「山下柔軟戰略」發揮光彩的時候，即在眼前了。（林譚自三月十五日朝日新聞）。</p>
<h3>行將開幕的　柏林攻防戰</h3>
<p>— 柏林通訊</p>
<p>如果沒有納粹黨大刀闊斧的改組及指導力，則所有的德國人會承認，決不會支持到今天。然而這一見解並不是完全對的。因爲如果單靠黨的指導鼓勵，則不會發生悲壯的全國抗戰。試觀面對最後決戰的目前德國內部情形，就可以深刻地感覺到穗國人血液中所含有的傳統的强韌國民性。</p>
<p>最後關頭</p>
<p>德國本土，業已由東方的敵人逐漸蠶食着，被天空上投下來的彈雨敲打着。形成家破人亡，父離子散的一幅悲慘景象。生活困難的程度，與日俱增。數百萬男女幼童，抱着一條氈子，由西跑到東，而又由東跑到西，往返不知所之。全國每一個角落都成爲戰塲的德國，這羣無辜的可憐幼意，自然找不到一處世外桃國。現在是聯合國想用雷霆萬鈞的軍事壓力，一舉粉碎德國的一剎那。換言之，目前戰爭形勢對於穗國，業已達到無以復加的最嚴重階段。但此時此情中的德國人，仍然堅持着自國戰鬥的旗幟。同時他們還想繼續戰鬥下去。固然勿庸諱言，有許多人不滿意目前的生活，但徵募令一下，縱是白髮蒼蒼的七十衰翁也無不挺身而起，荷鎗負彈，走上戰塲。此時此地，不是考慮明日命運的時候，或是非難今日的戰爭和諷咒政治的時候了。現在堅持抗戰到底的聲浪，充滿了全國。如按西洋的功利主義社會來說，這眞是一件不可思議的奇事。過去的所有歌洲同盟國，在戰爭方酣時，竟葉甲曳兵，舉手屈膝以求敵人的憐惘，但穗國雖腹背遭英美蘇三國大軍壓迫，仍然在歐洲中原抗着戰鬥旗轍，這眞是應國民族之陣大處。</p>
<p>在德國會經討論過，前此蘇聯軍隊的頑張担抗力，究竟是從何而來？最初大多數人都認爲：共產主義的思想和組織力是蘇聯致勝的原因。然而後來，由於東錢的數度經騐，德國人才知道蘇聯的堅強性是產自斯拉夫民族的天性。今日德國人這樣能够堅持，也可以同樣理由來說明。尤其是在別人的國土內作戰和在本國內作戰的情緒，逈乎不同。戰綫逐漸一再退至本國的領土，親眼看到砲火在焚燒自己的家鄉以來，固然客觀形勢一天比一天的不利，但德國人民的戰意與士氣，却愈益旺盛了。到今天，全部德國人民方眞正體騐到了這是爲自巴生存的戰爭。就是說，普通士的軍國　義，所謂德國百戰百勝的精神，日爾曼人的頑强性，過去歷史的傳統，和德國人的性絡，都是決定此次戰爭的因素，也是頑强抗戰意識的源泉。</p>
<p>兩大台柱</p>
<p>組織國民的抗戰意識，以及對戰力構成起最大作用者，就是納粹黨。所以國民的戰意和納粹的組織，就是決戰階段上支持德國的兩在台柱。換言之，就是老德國和新德國，而這兩個台柱是相互支持的。無論那一個台柱折斷，戰爭都會失敗的，這是不言而喻的事實。所以面對着最大困難的今天，這兩大合柱的相互依存關係，是無法判斷的。當法國被英美軍隊佔領，島克蘭境內蘇聯紅軍進行神速的閃電戰時，這兩大台柱竟自合而為一。然而今日雖然有老的固有傳統和新的組織，但二者却有密切不可分的關係。「爲親愛的祖國領土而奮鬥！」這一最高原則，在鼓舞着納粹黨員和非黨員的精誠團結，一致對外。</p>
<p>誘降意大利及其他軸心同盟國的英美，仍不忘對於德國人民不斷實行成脅利誘。過去策劃黨與人民分化的陰謀，早已失敗，但最近又重演一番，例如克里米亞會談時，曾向德國人民宣佈：「只有納粹黨後是我們的公數」。然而穗國人民財於這行戰爭的决心，始終不慨。雖然戰綫上往往首尾不相應，以及不合作的現象，但拼命補救失敗的澎湃熱情，以及後方忍受最大犧牲而想爭取勝利的決心，却是值得五體投地的。</p>
<p>信仰領袖</p>
<p>假如有一個敵人向德國一個普通人間戰爭的前途說：「目前戰爭形勢業已大致決定，如仍無意義的抵抗，徒供犧牲，何不早日投降？」該德國人一定會這樣國答：</p>
<p>「我們水認穗國戰爭的指導上有很大的失敗，國民也有很多的錯誤。但我們並不水認希特勒總統是一位不負責任的政治家。像希特勒這樣愛護德國的人物，決不會只顧犧牲穗國人民的生命和幸福，而一直繼續沒有希緊的戰爭。我們普通人不知道德國的軍力及戰鬥力尚右多大。總統很知道這一點，所以仍在繼續作戰。我們相信，只要希特勒在作戰，在純軍事觀點上德國就仍有機會致勝。所以我們服從總統的號令而上戰塲。除此之外，德國還有其他生路麼？」</p>
<p>由於長時問的戰局不利，在蘇聯軍及英美軍東西挾擊下，考慮到德國命運時，穗國人便作上而的想決。如果不承認上面的想法，則不會瞭解目前德國激烈抵抗的原因。</p>
<p>柏林佈防</p>
<p>現在距離柏林不到五六十公里的東面，就是奧得河如火如荼的戰塲。蘇聯最精銳的蘇克夫軍隊在奧得河的東面，業已完成新的編制，新的佈置，也已經完成彈藥和食糧的補充，只等待號令一發，就向柏林大舉進攻的。二月三日美國空軍大規模的轟炸柏林以來，柏林市業已眞成爲二個戰塲丁，市內的外形，現在業已令人驚心動魄地改換了一副新的面目。十字路口上的防壘沙袋，一天此一天地在增加數　。繁華的大馬路，也都交通斷絕，只允許軍用卡車通過。因爲敵人的轟炸，到處都有鐵片和傳瓦等防壘用材料。拚命搬運逍些材料，而帮助柏林佈防的，多半都是穿着軍服的蘇聯俘虜。在所有的橋樑傍邊或十字街頭，穿着普通西裝，戴着禮帽的人民突擊隊員上背着步槍在準備着，這很明顯地業己表現出是戒嚴了。</p>
<p>決心死守</p>
<p>担任第三戰區者，即保衛大柏林巿的最高當局，過去曾是希特勒總統，而現在則改任赫因謝特這位無名中將了。赫因謝特中將用無綫電單向柏林市民廣播，並且委派了柏林近郊的個別防禦司令，完全使柏林化爲一大要塞堡壘，淮備死守德京了。近郊的湖泊，河流，山嶺，自然也都充分加以利用，作爲保衛計劃中的夫然屏障。關於德國首都日夜兼行的廣汎防禦對策，我們自然毫無自由加以詳細報告。我們所能報告者，就是柏林決不像巴黎和羅馬一樣，宣告爲不設防城市，把政府機關　移到別處去避難。然而東方七十公里處的蘇克夫軍隊，就是發動大攻勢也只不過是直接「强化柏林」而已。擁有四百萬市民的大都市，今後將在砲火彌漫中成爲敵軍包圍下的孤城。從東方前綫上逃下來的難民，在柏林市內滿坑滿谷，尤其婦孺佔最大多數。但政府一直到現在尚未下令撤退。爲什麼還不下令撤退呢？主要是因爲這樣多的人口，在全德國就找不出一個比較安全的地帶可以容納，就是撤退也是往返徒勞。還有一個原因，就是德國政府當局早已考慮到，如果放棄首都柏林，則會給整個戰爭以決定性的嚴重影響。所以柏林大會戰的開始，恐怕就是最後決定德國命運的分歧點。四百萬市民也都會全體參加此次大戰的。</p>
<p>煤氣，電力，自來水等沒有的時候，一般市民的食糧，也要像軍隊一樣，將實行大規模的配給制度。大柏林武裝市民團「國民衝鋒隊」的最高指揮官，是宣傳部長郭培爾傳士。現在對於德國的嚴重關頭，一分一分地接近了。蘇聯紅軍以蘇克夫軍爲中心，左翼高諾夫軍，右翼羅果索夫斯甚軍，行將展開大戰，道正像鶴　陣一樣地準備好了。固然德國也決不會認輸，而立刻締結城下之盟，所以目前正在慎重計劃反攻作戰，決心死守。</p>
<p>士氣旺盛</p>
<p>我們根據克里米亞會談的決議，完全司以推想得到英美軍隊將在二月中或在三月初發動西綫新的攻勢，歐洲戰局將在三四月裹還有重大的決定。道種估計決不能算是武斷。</p>
<p>德國的報章和無綫電每天在反復地大吹大擂地說，倫敦也在一九四〇年曾受過德軍摧枯拉朽的打盤，而陷於風雨飄搖中，當時因於英國人沉着應戰，結果渡過難關；莫斯科和列寗城也曾飽嘗德軍的大包回，但因蘇聯人民的堅强性格，而終於反敗爲勝；柏林固然不準備學習敵人，但想堅持下去，粉碎他們的野心。這種一再重複的報道，就是鼓勵國民士氣的。倫敦當時的危機，尚有美國友軍參戰的希望，莫斯科危險時代，尚有廣表的大後方，以及無數的人力物力資源作戰爭的後援。當時的英國及蘇聯，是全有依靠的。但今日的穗國依靠什麼呢？並打算依靠什麼呢？單從軍需生產方面來說，與魯爾工業區具有同等價值的上西里亞重工業地帶，已喪失給蘇聯，前此波籣殖民地及捷克斯拉夫，瓦爾特河流域等處的軍需工塲，也被蘇聯佔領，這種損失實在無法補償。唯一的救星就是與瑞典中立國的通商關係，但也遂漸惡化。按今日的形勢，軍需品的補充，只好靠過去貯藏原料來供給，再就是靠新發明的武器來填補一部份損失。此外則別無他法。這種補償旣是微乎其微，那末德國所依賴者，就是旺盛的士氣及優秀的作戰指導。戰爭形勢愈形迫切以來，國民的士氣就是戰勝敵人飛機大砲的最大和最後武器。（新譯自柏林二月二十二日守山通信）</p>
<h3>歐洲戰事形勢圖</h3>
<p>歐洲東西兩綫，現入決戰階段。西綫北翼反軸心軍在明登地方，　越威奉河東進，關以漢諾威爲目標，中路美第三軍自開入紹倫吉亞區後，遭遇德軍猛烈抵抗，進展殊　。據七日電訊：東綫蘇軍坦克除已突人舊奧都維也納，沃特河飾綫蘇軍集中兵力，大戰有一觸即發之勢。</p>
<h3>工商界應有的措置</h3>
<p>— 雨順</p>
<p>自米價飛漲，本市工商百業，頓趨義落；一反過去畸形繁榮的狀態，處此時會，工商業者宜作適當措置辦法，以應付當前難局。茲本拋磚引玉之意，貢獻管見於后，藉供參考。</p>
<p>調整工作時間　查目前公司行號的工作時間，大槪爲六小時至十小時，與以前的工作時間比較，似未見縮短；即使偶有縮短老，所減亦不過一二小時。但公司行號的業務，則極度淸淡，最好者，亦僅及以前極盛時之一半。是故倘將工作時間減少一半，對於業務之處理，諒決無間題發生，然可得下列種種利益：（一）增加職工進修及經營副業時間，（二）減少職工住返次數，範省人力及物力，（二）無形中增加職工的工作酬報。工作時間究應如何調整，可經過同業公會的決議，藉資一律。</p>
<p>裁減冗員　公司行號與其茍延殘喘，不如爽爽快快的把不需要的職工裁減，給予相當數額的解雇金，讓他們在當局疏散人口期間，返鄉謀生。假定再不死不活地拖下去，公司行號固將拖空，職工積蓄，也將貼光。到那時公司行號即欲載減職工，恐對於一筆解雇金，即無法付給。同時，被裁職工，單　區區的解顧金，連返鄉恐也不能了，遑論藉此別營他業。</p>
<p>增加酬報　公司行號對於保留的職工，應給予合理的酬報，務使所得，能維持最低生活，然後始能專心工作，公司行號亦得賴以維持，而圖未來的發展。酬報改採實物貨幣混合制，除按期給予薪金外，最好配給米·燃料·油·監等必需品。</p>
<p>要渡過難關，確是不容易的，假定公司行號能在可能範圍內，考慮採取上述的繁急措置，也許會渡險如夷，這全看怎樣實行！</p>
<h3>物資配給透視（下）</h3>
<p>— 劉寗五</p>
<p>戶口配給與特種配給</p>
<p>自實施上海物資配給工作以來，即分爲戶口配給與特種配給兩種。前者向用憑證配給制度，凡區內納稅人，憑市政總捐收據及保甲制度之戶口證，一併持向發證所，申請領證，市民按配給處之佈告，可向該處指定店購領配給物資。現在經配給處指定之食米零賣店，約九六九家，水上保甲零賣店四家，煤球零賣店約六二八冢，皂柴約四二五家。復者計分食米，麵粉，食糖，煤球，皂柴，煤斤。牛奶等項，茲分而論之如下：</p>

<p>食糖—依據以前糖商合作營業處核准之數量，實施配給。</p>
<p>煤球—受配者係政府機關及慈善團體等。</p>
<p>皂柴—受配者爲醫院，洗衣業公會及酒菜食業公會等。</p>
<p>煤斤—受配者係熟水業公會會員。</p>
<p>牛奶—受配者係醫院，老弱嬰兒等。</p>
<p>今後配給之注意點</p>
<p>現在日本·德國·英國·美國·瑞士等國，業已實施物資配給制度，其成効著否，姑置勿論。查物資配給制度，在戰時經濟政策上，非常重要。不但能抑平物價之上漲，且亦能防遇囤積之猖狂。茲關於今後配給方針，　述管見於於次：</p>
<p>政府爲保全一般人民之最低生活，必須具打開一切難關之決心。</p>
<p>其次應澈底與有關配給之盟邦機關合作，設法充實來源間題，同時商洽運輸問題，收買價格問題等，共負滬市物資配給之責。</p>
<p>設法籌謀南北各地物資之交流，採取有無相</p>
<p>應大規模檢舉囤積，如發現與配給有關之物資，將其充公，應交配給處以平價售給市民。</p>
<p>應採取代替物配給，譬如現在戶口米配給，在未配售以前，應儘量增加雜糧等配給。或者移現在實施之各業麵粉特種配給，應增配於一般巿民用戶上，亦為適當之措置。</p>

<h3>改良掘井蒭議</h3>
<p>— 王霈霆</p>
<p>從本市自來水一再減低用量以來，市民深感用水不足之苦，故各里弄紛紛開掘土井以謀補救，唯此等土井多數開掘不良，致水質殊欠淸潔，不堪食用，僅可供洗濯而已。</p>
<p>尤重要者則爲該項土井對居民之危險性頗大，蓋此項捆井工程皆係包工建造，多數偷工滅料，尤以幷圈爲甚。表面似頗堅固，實際不過磚土所砌，而數以極薄之石灰，一經水沒，即行倒塌，各種危險，隨之而生。小焉者如貓犬之類跌人井中，淹斃腐爛，若未經察覺，一旦食用有礙衛生。設黑夜與行燈火管制之時，行人稍一不慣，即有失足落井可能，對於兒童，尤爲危險。設遇空襲或火災，居民爭先逃命，里弄狹窄，人如潮湧，落井溺斃，亦在意中。</p>
<p>為避免以上種種可能之不幸事件，最妥善之法，莫如將井圈除去，而用水泥舖成平面，四周開小孔以通空氣，中開一洞，上大下小（以孩童不能跌下爲度）其大小以能供長圓鉛桶汲水爲宜，並配以瓶塞式之石蓋，於不用時緊蓋之。如經濟許可，最好能裝打水帮浦，該項帮浦可設於有水清之牆壁附近，如此旣可省以桶汲水之煩，又不至妨礙交通，實有百利無一弊。望市民於開掘新井時，對以上各點，予以注意，實功總無量也。（酬稿助學）</p>
<h3>開放公園</h3>
<p>— 絕雅</p>
<p>在這人口密集的都市裹，要得到一點新鮮空氣，除幾所公國之外，可說別無去處。上海人烟密集，原有的公園本不敷分配。最近却又突然有了變更，那就是幾所公園不開放了，終日閉門，巿民不得其門而入。</p>
<p>査公園不開放，當然有別種用度，然而也不會自長至暮使用整天的，一部份時間應富還是空着。</p>
<p>所以，筆者提議，將公園開放時間加以縮短；以不妨礙別種用度爲原則，重予開放。在公園則充分利用，在市民則遊　有所，不識當局能採納及此否。</p>
<h3>車輛晚間燃燈之必要</h3>
<p>— 顧期仲</p>
<p>邇來馬路問人力車自行車等，每以晚間不備燈火，致肇禍事件，無日無之，尤以自行車爲最。最奇者亦有少數之公務人員，乘坐自行東亦公然不燃燈，橫衝直撞，一若當局無此法令然。又如人力車，晚間不燃燈，執法者然視無睹，令人莫明所以。當此市政績極刷新之際，事關公衆安全，甚盼當局予以注意。</p>
<h3>嚴備敵美作戰</h3>
<p>敵太平洋作戰，在控制硫黃島後，其空軍基地已由馬里亞納向前推進一千公里，而馬尼刺入其手中時，該灣即可化爲前綫的一大補給基地，我們在先前即已指明。敵前亞洲艦隊司令耶納爾曾投稿「紅色艦隊」報，露骨表明此稱戰略意圖，同時自誇自贊，對於跋涉太平洋上五千哩的長途，終於完成今日的戰略勢態的本國海軍努力，備加誇獎，强調海軍第一主義，最後則稱今後的對日上陸作戰，主要任務亦在海軍肩上。</p>
<p>敵方謀略</p>
<p>在那篇論文中，他說其本國軍隊已入馬尼剌，如果卡比得軍港恢復時，縱然不能作爲太平洋全艦隊的　泊地，至少也可供作補給船國的基地，所以馬尼刺灣的價值極大。活用這個前進補給基地，並配合其海軍的軍要機動部隊，向前直進時，則在日本本土上陸，決不是不可能的。並暗示與其實行麥克沃塞的亞洲大陸登岸作戰，毋寗展開尼米資的直接進攻日本作戰，絕端推崇海軍的效用。力主海軍第一主義·這種議論，在我們是無論怎樣都好的。在登陸周圍不足四里半的硫黃島時，他們尚且動員太平洋全艦隊，付出莫大的代價。而他們在法國北部登陸時，單是橫渡僅需三小時航程的英法海峽，亦須英國全部海軍的掩護援助，並　先須費了二年餘的工夫作周到的準備。只要想起了這些，就可想見其他。</p>
<p>枕戈而待</p>
<p>即使如耶納爾所說，馬尼刺港開設爲補給基地時，將可收得大效，而其太平洋基地將可由夏成夷前進三五千哩，亦是事實。假定改編成功的第五十入機動部隊，其性能確如地們誇稱那樣相當可觀，則據格　關於硫黃島作戰的說明，美兵一人的補給，最初一個月需十六噸，其次一個月需六噸。若平均以八噸計，假定他們要派遣廿萬的上陸軍，就需要一百六十萬噸的補給。而且，這支補給船團，自馬尼刺至日本本土，在二千三百公里的長距航行中，須蜿蜓列成長蛇似的船列，與其賴爲主要戰力的機動部隊相銜，勢必曝露其巨體於日本基地空軍的轟炸圈內。枕戈而待的日本强兵勇將，豈是徒然無爲的嗎。對於他們，最大的危險即在於此。</p>
<p>把握良機</p>
<p>耶納爾現在可說是一個未親負作虞之　的提督，但由敵機動部隊的動靜歡間不用說，即從太平洋戰局的現勢而言，尼米資的意圖在於覬視日本本土，徇屬無疑。耶納爾可說即其代表發言人。敵軍的作戰企圖旣如是明白，我們自須即刻戒備。應整備的是什麼？不必說，就是航空兵器的大增產，大積貯。而且，以我統帥的神謀，適當的吋機一到，即將大爆發。擊減敵人的神機，決非等着就會來的。將來的時機能否成爲真的神機，實賴我等一　國民的努力，唯有在流血流汗的拼死努力之下，才能把　良機。這點應該切記。現在不是巳到一致奮起的時候了麼？（譯自三月九日讀賣報知）</p>

<h3>阿藍</h3>
<p>— 泓英</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>灰白的光綫，在冷空氣裹偷偷地伸展它的足步；衹幾十分之一秒，它創造了驚異的過程。越過了大廈，越過了大廈的窗檻，的桌椅·的地板。終於，當晨星寥落的天空由黑而泛成了一片魚肚色時，它是佔滿了每一空間，大廈裏的一切也就變白。變亮了！</p>
<p>阿藍在這時候打了個呵欠，他是剛從夢裘醒來；在夢裹，他又變成了個作家；一個被許多孩子熱愛着的敎師……他幸福·自由·快活。但阿藍却從歡樂的情緒裏睜開了眼，連忙再側轉身子，狠狠地合上眼臉，想再回到夢境裹去。因爲他又瞧見了他所最厭惡。最感煩惱的東西：那粉黃的牆壁，闊綽的沙發，遠處的寫字　·電話機，都刺激着他髯弛不久的神經。於是阿藍的情緒像水銀柱般的漸漸上昇，他的一顆年靑的心，在跳動·跳動·跳動……。</p>
<p>「起身啦，該死的！」理智向阿藍挑戰，而眼前一個一個人影，都從被窩裹攢起來，以急促的音節在地板上來往。阿藍沒法，也從雙疉鋪上翻起身子，取一條毛巾，一雙面盆·牙刷·牙粉，開始早晨的例課。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>阿藍以迅速的脚步走下樓梯，在客廳的檯子上躺着的簽到簿上劃了幾筆，然後跑進辦公窒。這裹，每天各人第一次見面並不需要有禮貌地點一下頭，或更客套的稱一聲「早！」只各自以相熟的眼光向周圍一掃，就沒精打彩地坐下安樂椅。小歇一回，拿出賬簿·鋼筆·算盤……忙碌熱鬧的無氛充滿了整個屋子。</p>
<p>阿籃用鑰匙打開保險箱，打開抽屜，拿出了一堆堆的文件·抄件。茶房送上一杯熱騰騰的紅茶，就喝了一口，潤一潤乾燥的嘴唇。「唉！」阿藍見了遺東西·這環境，就感頭痛·悶氣，但也不得不動起筆來。</p>
<p>外邊的人羣似潮水般的湧進這銀行裹來，同事們都在忙碌地應接着笑展臉·尤其是出納科，一疊疊紅紅綠綠的票子擲出櫃去，又一疊疊紅紅綠綠的從人們手中搬進來。阿藍厭惡遺些，厭惡金錢，厭悲可憐愚蠢的傢伙在搬演着悲喜劇。</p>
<p>「好好好……嘿嘿嘿，沒關係，算數。五百萬，五百萬，……沒關係，沒關係……」一位胖主任，提起金嗓子向電話筒笑着，呌着。在阿藍看來，這外表的善，就是內在的惡毒心計的替代。「偽君子，媽的，市儈，狗東西！該千萬次入地獄。」阿藍厲害地咒咀着，並以不屑的眼光看着他歡樂的臉，偽善的臉，麻本的臉……。</p>
<p>那邊，阿籃靜靜地留意着，一位庶務先生使起了暴躁的性子在發怒，駡人。「喂，茶房！怎麼的，你們杯子也揩不乾爭怎麼的？阿根實香烟還不來？……」</p>
<p>那邊，阿茲的視綫轉移一下，這位庶務先生走近　理身邊去了，剛才的怒氣在臉上立刻斂了跡，而是無邊笑意，無盡殷勤，無量親切。「朱先生，準這樣兒做好了，請放心。我明天一早派人來，……是，派人來。」</p>
<p>再那邊，阿藍的眼跳向一個年老職員的身上。據阿藍知道，這位滿頭斑白，年已上了五十歲的老文書，從年紀靑的時候就吃這行飯。可是，文書澱是個文書。現在，做事欠敏捷，文思也桔課了。看他！接連一支一支的抽劣牌烟，接連撕破一張一張草稿，接運一聲一聲的嗆咳，吐痰，喘氣……。</p>
<p>阿藍的情緒，完全隨於來推測各人各色的變化上。慢慢地，他的心光不安寗起來了，表面上他雖彎着身子，動着筆，把精神完全釘住在工作上；實際，阿藍的腦袋裹充滿了無數情景，他的思想在旋轉，旋轉……。他想：什麼是人？什麼是人間？</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>正十二時，樓上的鈴聲響了起來，辦公室裏的每一個人都意識到是午膳的時候了。連忙擱下工作，脫離座位，以奔跑的速度走上樓。於是樓梯上全是一隻一隻脚；阿藍也跟他們坐上了飯桌。這裏每一靈魂的情緒顯得極度緊張；一隻手捧飯碗，一隻手捏筷；那些年輕的，揀了一塊肥肉，再搶一筷鮮魚。那些年老的，也二筷筷的取炒蛋，一筷筷的搶肉絲。大家使起勁兒，使起野性，拼命的把飯珠兒向口中嚥。偶然，有些兒在緊張的空氣裹舒一口氣，露出些厭惡，但這樣，他們把飯菜塞飽了肚子，每個靈魂就感到滿足，滿足了他們的一餐。</p>
<p>十分鐘內，一隻隻菜盆變了空，一個個座位變了空，桌上抵剩阿藍一個人。立刻，一種難以訴說的感覺充滿了他的腦海。阿藍總想不透這是什麼現象。「唔，這是飢渴之害，」阿藍想起古書上的話了：「飢渴之害足以爲心害。是的，人們爲了生的意志的驅動，爲了不得不接受生的挑戰，就這麼幹，可是……？」</p>
<p>阿藍昏悶地回到安樂椅中，茶房又送上一杯熱騰騰的紅茶，地把它一口飲盡了。趁着有些空閒，他垂下了頭向着寫字檯上的一塊方玻璃，作無盡的思索。周圍的事物一觸進他的眼簾，他就竭力思索他們爲什麼這末幹。看，有幾個年老的同事，盡是曲了背的，滿頭白髮，皺紋，現在正抽着烟，悠然地在聊天了。他們的臉色多麼安祥，平和。還有那此年輕的，雖然三十多個中間，有十之六七的黑髮裏已長着幾絲白髮，但他們也沒有一些憂慮和憔悴，而表現得很得意，很舒適。自己呢，靈魂天天在騷擾，痛苦，沒有一刻能安寗，這是爲什麼？究竟爲了什麼？</p>
<p>阿藍愈壓榨着自己的腦袋想，他的煩悶愈像潮般的湧來。「哼，愚蠢的人們爲自己掘墳墓麼？自己毀滅自已的前程麼？」什麼是生活的意義，什麼是工作的目的？他看到現實，看到現實中的變化，突然感到茫然了。「他們……」阿藍找不出適當的理由爲這般人作解釋，於是他更茫然了。</p>
<p>「不，」阿藍的靈魂叫了起來，「他們確是自掘墳墓的，但你，阿藍，你也能這樣的迷混過去嗎？你不是有一個美麗的夢想，一個美麗的人生？這環境，這醜惡，祗了給你人生的一種經騐，一種展示；雖然它也給你一種苦難，而人們於苦難是應當忍受的。」</p>
<p>「阿藍，」靈魂叫得更響，「正視這種生活！」</p>
<p>四</p>
<p>一天的工作過去了，各個靈魂都露出他們的愉快的情緒，整理一下身子，平靜地離開辦公室。漸漸分散，分散，把影子消失在歸途上。</p>
<p>五</p>
<p>暮色一層一層的添置，宿舍裏變成漆黑。阿藍　亮了電燈，在昏黃的燈光下打開一本「尼采自傳」看着，想着；他全身的肌肉，在不斷的緊張，鬆弛；鬆弛，緊張……。</p>
<p>——人們應當表現他的眞實力量，不爲低下的與短視的無我的　使所汚染……</p>
<p>——生長在潮濕空氣中的孩子，不必需的為着命運抱悲觀，我們除了成爲改革者外，更無他法，——我們決不能放過事物上容留着假冒偽善者的情况。</p>
<p>阿藍的心靈奔放起來；他忘了環境，忘了一切印象，猶如生長在草原裹的一隻小兔，帶着好奇，興奪，虔敬，奔向有着仙樂的樹林中去。他領會着大哲的言語，懂得怎樣是自我，怎樣是命運，怎樣是反抗！</p>
<p>六</p>
<p>夜深沉，一個一個人影兒從外邊溜回來，宿舍裹立刻充滿了强烈的酒味，烟味，和那放縱的談笑。</p>
<p>—老柳，今天喝的好酒，眞雞得的好酒。</p>
<p>—老柳，喂，別裝着耳聲，今天股票的妙頭怎樣，漲吧，跌？搶了一隻帽子，（懷疑地）賺進了？怪不得！</p>
<p>—老柳運道好，小李，我們要他請客……</p>
<p>—當然請客，明天，上高士滿去，那邊娜娜在等着你呢！不可玩一個痛快。</p>
<p>—唷，還要裝獃子，有了錢不擺闊嗎？一定去……</p>
<p>—什麼，沒有西裝，借給你；皮鞋舊了，買一雙……</p>
<p>阿藍聽不慣這些胡鬧話，他彈着二隻澄淸的眼珠，凝想出神。他的少許短鬍子，象微着他的剛毅，倔强和高傲。慢慢地，周圍卑鄙的現象刺激他的火焰上昇。於是，他的二個瞳于裏，充溢着明亮的流光，彷彿是淚，不，是他熟烈的情光在昇華。</p>
<p>他想：—</p>
<p>上帝不是賦與每一人類有一個靈魂嗎？純潔的靈魂不是不能接受那些卑鄙低下的情景嗎？並且因爲靈魂的知覺，人們要向那些惡毒無恥的東酉反抗嗎？現在呢，爲什麼人們生活在這爲罪惡淵蔽的圈子裹而不自覺，他們反而很自然地笑，過活。那末，他們的靈魂呢？他們的靈魂給誰掠奪去，給誰受劇烈的拷打和桎梏以至不能發聲？……</p>
<p>阿藍再從現實上推想：那此年老的職員們，在年靑的時候，同樣有着一個活發勇敢的靈魂，向現實正視，奮鬥。然而，慢慢地，慢慢地，外來的刺戟，障礙，苦難，不斷的增加。或者，爲了那些官目的貪婪和慾望，他們的靈魂就此喪失了成為一身中心的地位；他們逃避責任，逃避正義。終於，靈魂在他們的身上是飄渺的了，而又一個一個的死去。他們祇剩得一個身軀一個麻木的神經。偶然，它們會得付活，但不過是些微的騷擾，呻吟，而總不能振作。從此，他們接受罪惡，接受邪道；他們把地獄看作了天堂，把黃金看作了生命。在歲月的催促下，走上死的墳墓去……。</p>
<p>一個人就這樣輕易的结束了自巳的一生！</p>
<p>七</p>
<p>阿藍思索得疲乏了。他，把身子倒在舖上去了。</p>
<p>宿舍裏的嘈雜聲音少許地低靜了，而一陣靡靡的音調又飄了進來。</p>
<p>—你是我的靈魂…雀雀雀…你是我的生命…</p>
<p>—唉唉，（歌聲裏和着二聲頺氣）不，不，不，哈哈哈，（這聲音變得高興起來了）你是我的生命，…雀雀…你是我的靈魂！</p>
<p>「生命！靈魂？」阿藍被道無聊的歌聲刺激得不能安寐。當他睜開了二個眸子觀察四周，似乎粉黃的墙上滿佈了尖頭的釘，椅上滿插了利口的刀；他的舖子，是一個用金絲織成的網。那些在談笑羞的，是一個個可怕的骷髏的。阿藍以爲：他掉在這可毀滅生命的陷阱裹。並且，他瞧見了一羣羣人將死亡於這網裏。於是，阿藍的一顆心靈在動盪，他審判自己，知覺自巴的靈魂在焰焰的烈火中煎熬，痛苦……同時，他，透視見自己的理想生活，一個作家，一個被無數孩子熱愛着的敎師……。因此，他的心跳動得更厲害了，像」頭無知的小鹿在樹林裹亂撞，他興奮起來，又忿怒起來，一個腦袋像要爆炸了的火藥庫。</p>
<p>「哼，你們！」阿藍挺坐在舖子上，高聲地，—他的二個眸子頓得更藍更亮更神氣—「你們這些死了的靈魂！死了的靈魂！把它找尋回來。」</p>
<p>每人靜止了下來，互相驚異着阿藍的話。但誰也不能理解話裏的意義：他們只以為今天阿藍發傻，有些瘋了。</p>
<p>外邊，夜的黑色更深，更重。</p>
<p>「…斯人獨憔悴」的情緒浮上了心頭，阿藍的靈魂裹體感到孤獨，寂寞；雖然也還有一點超人助氣質。</p>
<h3>紀周璇歌唱會</h3>
<p>— 鐵鷹</p>
<p>是春節的前奏吧，周璇用幾曲淸歌來答謝愛護她的　衆和影迷，金都的門前，演出了事永馬龍的盛况。獻曲共分三部，包括名歌十支，都是周璇所主演的影片中最受歡迎的主題歌或插曲，也是勝利和百代銷數最廣的灌片中的名歌。</p>
<p>拉開了黃綢的序幕，露出內層紫紅的絲幕來。普樂臺前，由上海交響樂隊演奏；金玉谷黎錦光聯合指揮。美麗的佈景，滲合着詩情畫意，而且還能用來配合每支的曲意，帮助完成表現的效果。一曲曲淸亮的歌詞，襯着背景鮮美的畫意，令人會連想到那是一篇篇抒情的新詩—聽衆們不僅能飽了耳福，而且也飽了眼福。</p>
<p>春草綠野，嫩柳柔條，白雲碧空中，幻演着美麗的彩區……歌者正蜿轉地喝着漁家女中的主題歌。給人的印象是：幽靜，淸麗，素淡。</p>
<p>第二部歌唱與換佈景的間歇，有嚴後和關胖十的消稽突梯新　別緻的對話，並集周璇所主唱之歌名編成故事，穿插笑料不少。</p>
<p>第二幕歌唱完畢　幕重垂時，請秦經章先生表演國變琵琶獨奏—淮險平楚。指法純熟，撥絃作金石珠玉聲，頗有精彩。</p>
<p>漁家女，鳳凰于飛中六支悅耳動聽的歡曲，由周璇小姐主唱後，第三部—　鳳和鳴也將開始了！舞臺上佈置得花團錦簇，富　堂皇。周小姐依着琴韻，曼聲和唱。這兒的特色」是：有輕柔，有婉轉，又甜潤，又淸亮，歌聲極其悅耳。輕重緩急，能用感情來操縱歌聲；又能用歌聲來表情遠意，傳送內心的情感。令人百聽不厭，不盡低迥。歌唱的藝術和心得，周小姐是自有其特殊的修養和天稟吧！</p>
<h3>啼</h3>
<p>— 史蒂</p>
<p>—題一個孩子的誕生—</p>
<p>生之哀歌！</p>
<p>揉混了驚，疑，懼，</p>
<p>作入世的第一聲。</p>
<p>…………</p>
<p>光—耀眼，</p>
<p>膚—刺痛，</p>
<p>空氣是條冷蛇，</p>
<p>鼓風箱祇生澀地扇。</p>
<p>…………</p>
<p>從這一哭開始，</p>
<p>饑，渴，便，溺，憂患，悲哀；</p>
<p>每方厘米一仟克的</p>
<p>和一切永恒的債務。</p>
<p>…………</p>
<p>從這一哭開始，</p>
<p>生，老，病，死，傷害，痛苦，</p>
<p>迎光綫遺一尾黑影</p>
<p>你是字宙間的一個整體。</p>
<p>…………</p>
<p>赤條條踏進人世之門，</p>
<p>細的胸脯跳着發燙的心；</p>
<p>四周是太冷的空氣，</p>
<p>因之須裹上軟的棉絮。</p>
<p>…………</p>
<p>手足軀體都由不得你，</p>
<p>從溫暖的黑屋中出來，</p>
<p>你走錯了，這是光亮的囹圄，</p>
<p>且放聲嘔盡第一次傷心！</p>
<h3>霧之歌頌</h3>
<p>— 夏如</p>
<p>地面也有雲烟，氤氫於屋頂，樹尖和行路人的臉，濕濕，輕輕，就像一雙白而柔的手，雖頑皮地掩遮住你的眼睛，可是你也只會嬌嗔，又怎忍怨怒？那原是熱戀者的柔美啊，她正撫摩和向你吐露心的輕語。</p>
<p>你也會佇滯於有霧的田岸和山谷？那似乎是靜止的乳白輕紗帳，卻也有個蠕動和旋舞的心靈。</p>
<p>「是天神—宇斯的嘆息，一夜醒來，又見蠢動的人類，於是噓氣了，」朋友向我這樣講，我搖搖頭；但瞧那瀰天的自幔，冉冉然遊嚴於拂曉的人間，輕狂得可愛我不信那是煩惱的唏噓，　大的神之煩擾。</p>
<p>霧里的風是快樂的風，帶着一種潮濕的芬芳，從霧的遊仃中飄飄而來，又颶颼而還。舐濕你的頭髮，讓你的額上留下吻過的唾沫，使你還惺忪的眼，睜開而明亮，面對着模糊一片，你會深深的吸一口氣，挺直了胸脯，無懼於霧逝後的血腥現實。</p>
<p>我喜歡有霧的黎明，它不僅溫存如情人的手；還慈愛像母親的眼，綜織着希望，無比的和藹和堅定。希望有一個更絇爛的朝陽，更晴朋的藍天。霧後往往有一個無雲的彎蒼。所以我更愛　天了！</p>
<p>在濃霧里，我們匍匐而行，懦怯而踽慢。躊躊於前面的電綫柱，　　於後面的車馬聲。於是我們懂了「思考」和「勇敢」的真締：思改你四周的混沌環境，該擇那條最穩當的路，鼓舞起向前的決心，朝霧中勇敢地進行。是　啓示我怎樣去思考和勇敢—對人生。</p>
<p>北歐的音樂是蒼凉沉冗的，而多霧地域，少女的歌聲卻有無限的凄怨，唱一首古老的抒情詩，祖母和母親的時代的舊傳說，有着哀愁和愛情，顫動的音響能劃破你善感的心。你要同聲一唱：「愛情如霧，來去無蹤，……」如泣如訴的霧之歌。</p>
<p>我讚美霧，但不能放情於霧後的白日，猶似尋夢的人，在夢中也會慄懼夢殘後的實境。霧里，醜惡暫時隱減；夢中，人生畢竟美麗。我有些怕見陽光下的一切。</p>
<p>這是頹廢嗎？我能憧憬於迷霧的綺麗，反不能微笑於霧去後的萬丈光芒？</p>

<h3>國際盃中意今晨複賽　有望於中華隊者</h3>
<p>— 必賢</p>
<p>今日星期日（八日）上午十時。在膠州公園有國際盃複賽，為中華對義大利。雖屬複賽，無異於決賽。蓋細考另一獲得決賽者之北歐實力，當不及上述二隊。故此戰之勝者，當可穩取皇座。</p>
<p>本屆加入此有關國際榮譽之競賽者有七。俄國·猶太·日本·在初賽中均遭淘汰。葡萄牙則於複賽中受北歐毒手。</p>
<p>形勢表</p>
<p>我中華隊初賽輪空，今日複賽，尙係初次露臉，即遇頑敵，得失關頭，繫於此一戰而已，其重要可知。觀乎此次所選之隊員，除賈幼良韓龍海李垚吳祺祥等均因在被黜之中，幾搜盡滬巿第一流選手。唯本人始終以為集各隊之精華於一爐，而事前並無充分之練習，不免有「明星制」之譏。勝敗固另外問題，合作默契，斷難望有最佳之果。筆者雖曾屢次為文，其奈言者徒勞諄諄。但目下事已迫眉，不得不圖。目下急須硏究者，當為陣容之如何佈置耳。據當局所公佈者為：</p>
<p>劉顯漢</p>

<p>旣有上列陣容之公佈，我人不妨再考究義大利之戰略及强弱點，而自忖是否妥當。査所謂義大利除者，勢將為淸一色之僑聯義將，名重於時之守門台　卡，亦得助陣。雖該隊門將胥屬上　之材，得力尙微，但聲勢必因此而益見雄壯之。其後衛西拉蒂羅旭萊，中衛奧托尼洛。雪維太。勃利尼，決無更動之理。前鋒以亞托馬利負病，中鋒將為泰克尼，右鋒巴瑪，左翼迪盤邦，右鋒巴　，左翼迪盤邦，右翼維拉，左鋒鮑傑，必然之位置。陣容已悉，進而談其戰略。守衛方面，前衛與後衛之間，始終成一直綫，彼此少合作之技巧表浪，所賴氣力足够，能追隨敵將耳。中堅奧托尼洛視之似為重守者，實則以其脚頭之硬，頗有隨心所欲之慨，或　遞兩翼，或妙交中路。故奧實為助攻最令人滿意之中堅。况其出脚毫無滯疑，極能收對方驟不及防之效。進攻而論，兩翼有翼傳翼之本領，而乏獨盤深入切中之功夫。兩內鋒頗能返防帶球，唯輙因兩內鋒之地位太亂，乃致無一種固定型之方式，更以各將射門脚頭，俱無分寸，故難得各界最好之評語也。</p>
<h3>李寗應易天生</h3>
<p>我中華之陣容是否合理，及對症下藥，當可鑒矣。我認為最失策者，即為左後衛李寗，而左前衛為宋靈聖。屢見李宋兩將代表華聯，佔此二位置，而每次顯出各自為政，頻露錯誤。而此次意大利之攻勢，右方較左方為有路，則重用李宋，無異授人以隙，豈非將鑄造大錯。鄙意應易李寗為李天生，兩人均為資格極老，經騐豐富之老將。但以脚頭氣力而言，後者有較前者勝之事實，必有謂李寗地位絕佳，我不否認。唯試觀李寗之脚頭軟弱，且所踢出之球，十九出界，一無落點較佳者。何况李天生與宋靈聖之間，可望有合作之收穫，決不會如李寗與宋靈聖之過去屢試無成功各自為政之現象演出。設或有以為李寗頭腦較天生為淸晰而必欲重任者，則我以為鐔福楨應與宋靈聖互易位置，為隊之合作而言，此守衛方而應有之改造。</p>
<h3>阿戴不踢為妙</h3>
<p>再談前鋒綫上，視名單之後，幾無人不認為盡屬知名之上將，而我頗覺得此一條鋒綫，可稱為老氣橫秋。夫前鋒最需要者在兩內鋒，有返陣帶球之氣力，孫錦順尙可，李義臣未必能辦到，勢將令孟義良感無搭手之感，實非得策。且事實上，進攻意大利之方法，除脚頭之外，須靠有一能竄之鋒，否則實難望擊破敵門。所列五鋒，皆為老將，但實無竄之勁矣。戴麟經之中鋒，確有博人欣賞，供給龍海一竄之配球，及交送幼良李垚最契默之地位。但賈·李·韓之旣不能出塲，我謂阿戴必將埋沒其才能。於是阿戴應退讓，而由李義臣主中，而另用高保正為內鋒為制敵合理之嘗試。許文奎雖有巧妙之球藝，終以體力不逮，極希自稔無力，應換郁黎明上塲。唯郁如上塲，盼其多作切中之球，切忌濫試拉門，郁之脚頭，亦漫無目的者。</p>
<p>以上所談，為記者對中華隊陣容有更改必要之建議，不　亦能邀當局同情乎？</p>
<p>最後，則切望臨陣將士，屆時和衷共濟，羣策羣力，勿存私見，奮勇到底，達到擊敗意將之心願，為國際爭光榮。凡屬球民，無不股望之也，勉哉！健兒！（樂）</p>
<h3>中北華聯　決勝追評</h3>
<p>籃球聯賽甲甲組中北華聯之決戰，當局因恐觀衆過多，發生糾紛，茍徒事提高門票，似有失提倡之本旨。故寗願於上週末（四月一日）上午十時假八仙橋靑年會健身房秘密舉行，賞亦為兩全不得已之策。結果中北大勝，甲甲組得以功德圓滿，當局得了却一件心事。但球迷聞之，自必怨常局之不近人情，無機欣賞為憾！筆者於是晨與該賽裁判金伯陶偕往，得未錯過。茲作追評此一塲決賽，聊助球迷止渴之意。</p>
<p>中北榮膺錦標</p>
<p>上塲之初，華聯　籃圈純熟，先聲奪人，中北亦不示弱，故分數始終異常接近，相差恒在二三分之間。及上半時完畢。中北以二十一對十八領先。下半時華聯回生有心，依然力圖收復，攻勢極好，緊追不　，中北毫不放鬆，戰情殊見精彩緊張。但華聯不幸在二十二對二十七落後時，因徐菊生之四次犯規，替補乏人，終至回大乏術，一任中北蹂躪。華聯敗北，中北遂得榮膺甲甲組錦標。</p>
<p>追評兩隊優點</p>
<p>評比塲決戰，實無最理想之球藝欣賞。蓋華聯有瞿錫麟·范慶公·張顯崙·全長春四騎士之北上未返，中北則亦有沈聿恭足傷未愈，譚永湛早已他去，　遙安在巴黎演戲忙。故雙方均見支配尙易，調　極艱，在此情形之下，當視乎彼此之謹愼從事，減少犯規為前提。中北固能注意此點，竭事留心，犯規乃少。反之，華聯以勃脫上半時之受罰出，下半時徐菊生又遭四次畢業，此允為華聯之所以失敗，相差有十九分之唯一理由矣。</p>
<p>華聯有三點，予人滿意。　為射籃之準，嘆為觀止。徐菊生張良雄孔廣益可稱球無中發。　為極多利用　人術，故能有從容遠射之機會。　為雖在中北人畏中，拚力作籃下跟進，不　於中北，値得稱頌。其失望者，當為吳成章之退化，一事無成，以及不能注意犯規，終至替換無人，而遭敗績為憾。</p>
<p>中北之成功處，厥在守術進攻，其所用人釘人，已見純熟，此其一。利用高度，多過頂傳遞，及籃下佇立作跟進托人，制敵死命為可取。進攻時雖少用擋人方法，但在無謂傳遞之中而具有誘敵之心，卓國榮之屢得空隙，皆好收穫也。</p>
<p>籃球季節已過，滬上精彩比賽，勢將　北　決戰而吿消散。微聞華北勇津籃球隊有　　來滬之說，及上海兒童圖書館　籌募經費擬邀中北　聯　　克仁餘作四張對抗義賽，果爾，則臨去秋波，籃球還可有一番盛况，我人將拭目以待。（道）</p>

<h3>韓龍海　前夜返抵滬上</h3>
<p>由於東華和僑聯及再戰以一球之差見負，球迷們都懷念起這一位白袍小將韓龍海。他有最高速度的竄頭勢，他具有比人猿麥尼蒂猛撲，快一步的功夫，所以得到是一麥尼蒂魁星」的雅號，而事實上，也確是麥尼蒂最怕的一員前鋒。</p>
<p>一月前韓將軍因公赴蚌埠，本來還有一二月的勾留，但是他為什麽突然遄返，據悉係福華主人程伯菴急電催返，因為在最近滬上將有一塲盛大的足球比賽，特邀龍海趕回參戰。筆者昨晤韓君。據云於前晚（六日）抵滬，預料屆時這一塲盛大足球賽，演出時，一有　將軍的助陣，必能使懷念的球民們蜂擁而去欣賞。眞的，也許他踢了這塲球，還要離滬呢，我人拭目以待比賽早日來臨。（久靜）</p>
<h3>跑馬廳球場　仍予租借比賽</h3>
<p>足聯會對塲地一項，的確煞費心思。每感不敷支配，影響球賽之進行多多。日前逸園跑狗塲，奉當局令，限期解散，球塲亦受停止開放之例。惡耗傳來，無異予足聯會嚴重打擊。（按足球各重要比賽以逸園球塲為最適當）最近跑馬廳亦有停止租借之說，因此塲地之恐慌，益臻嚴重，能公開售票之塲地，僅碩果獨存之膠州公園而已。</p>
<p>足球聯賽與各盃賽，雖巳成尾聲，而所餘之賽，均富有吸引力，須要廣大之塲合。膠園容量較少，加以秩序較難維持。足聯會數度會商，終難得圓滿結果。昨據可靠方面消息，關於跑馬廳塲地，仍允予開放，並編續租借與足球賽使用。足聯會聞訊後莫不額手稱慶，目前之塲地問題可望解決，亦球迷之喜訊。（木子）</p>
<h3>體壇拾零</h3>
<p>前全國二百米四百米紀錄保持者曾榮忠，閩之福建人，畢業於國立濟南大學。現在泰國首都西貢，繼其父業，經營米木材等買賣。日前來函謂：近因海運阻塞之故，營業頗形淸淡。（樂達觀）</p>
<p>白馬小型足球隊，去歲曾在福華盃中稱雄，最近聞有白馬足球隊之成立，除原有賈幼良戴麟經張林根等健將外，復擬邀名手加入，其陣容堪稱無匹，已有程伯菴氏着手進行，一俟有緖，將與海上強隊對抗，當可一新球迷耳目。</p>
<p>綠隊黃杏芬自去夏出閣後，日前途値，已見大腹便便，喜事又臨。</p>
<p>紅塵主編之「體壇人物誌」初版已銷售一空，可見其內容精湛，現悉再版亦於日前問世，預料又可風行一時，體壇人士，必以先睹為快。</p>
<p>錢旭滄與謝益欽近每日在黃家沙狄克乒乓室作乒乓之嬉，蓋年事關係，籃球已有力不勝任之感，唯此畫上運動，藉以舒筋骨耳。（永端）</p>
<h3>綠隊嚴蔚　出閣在即</h3>
<p>從啓秀女學籃球隊，一直紅到現在充任絲隊女子籃球中鋒的嚴蔚雯小姐。她的球藝是與日俱進，所以本屆的成績，可以說是嚴小姐最　峯的狀態中。我人正希望她繼續努力，有更嶄新的表演，提高女子籃球水準。</p>
<p>嚴小姐的優點，是體格標準，氣力充沛腦筋淸晰，射籃準確，綠隊之所以能稱霸滬壇，嚴小姐實具有相當功績。尤可貴者，嚴小姐在球賽，始終笑顏逐開，對於得失，似優之度外，因此她得到了「甜姐兒」的雅號，揚威於體壇。</p>
<p>現在消息傳來，嚴小姐出閣有期，巳決定在下星期內。至於確實日期，尙未得探悉。雖然，記者曾多方面打聽，亦曾走訪嚴小姐，她終是笑瞇瞇的敷衍着說：「到那天准邀先生吃喜酒」，所以就無法報吿，可以決定者，便是准在下一週的一天。</p>
<p>嚴小姐結婚後，大概預備離開上海。是則綠隊受到損失，球迷的眼福也太淺了。</p>
<p>的確，我時常為一個正在進展中的女球員，突然結婚後，絕跡球塲，有一點莫名的徬徨。（瘦記者）</p>
<h3>籃球學理述要　（十五）</h3>
<p>— 梁兆安</p>
<p>搶奪遮板彈回球之法</p>
<p>搶奪遮板彈回球之法，首要在對方投籃之際，勿被敵搶前，站在我與籃之間，將球擋住，應在對方球已出手時，走近籃下立穩，身體稍行蹲下，助見球擊板彈出，立刻儘力躍起。在最高處，高舉兩手奪球，球須握緊在手中，不宜以手拍擊。及至兩足觸地時，球即放在腹間掩護，同時以眼尾，左右顧盼。如被敵嚴防，即設法逃出，或旋轉，或拍球至塲邊，尋覓空着之同伴傳出。如在獲球後，無敵大防守，則　先　機會，乘敵之不務，實行快攻之法，用遠速度傳球，傳至　下之同伴投入。能常專得遮板彈回之球者，非獨可使對方失去跟蹤投籃之機會，且我方獲球進攻之次數亦增多，因而獲勝之希望，亦較對方為高，故奪得遮板彈回之球，為防守法最重要之技能也。</p>
<p>對非持球之敵人防守法</p>
<p>對非持球之敵人，防守之法，首先注意，處處站在敵與籃之間，傳可球入兩被　守。倘在監守時，被敵搶前，跑得比我為快，此時宜背球而跑，急趨籃前，佔得內圈，覓最短之路和，再將敵截住。且走　以手　動，驚擾敵方，及使傳球不易傳給他。倘在監守時，對方不動，則宜先判斷對方之技能，而定防守所站之位置。如對方善於遠投籃者，則宜站得較近，使他不易投籃。如對方比我　敏者，則宜離他較遠，走至較近內圈，以便視察其動向，縮短防守路綫。但須常留心對方行阻擋之法，被敵方以二人夾攻。</p>
<p>對持球敵人之防守法</p>
<p>對持球敵人之防守法，除保持常站在敵與籃當中之外，尙須斟酌情形，而下奪球之法。倘非在對方拍球完畢時，則不宜急忙上前奪搶，亦不宜離他太近。否則他可乘機，利用旋轉逃脫，或用拍球避開。故在此時，所站位置，宜以伸手能及於他所持之球為度。待他不留神時，才將他所持之球拍出而奪獲之。拍球之法，應從下方往上拍，不應從上方往下拍。如對方在拍球完畢後，遇我防守。此時則可立即上前奪球，亦可站得較近，使對方慌忙錯亂，而將球失落。或成跳球。但於近敵之時，須嚴防其擊地反彈傳球，傳球後即行逃脫，使自己徒然撲空，留處敵後。故非有十分把握者，實不宜强行奪球之舉也。</p>
<p>人對二人之防守法</p>
<p>一人對二人之防守法，常在對方快攻時用之。在此情形，防守之法，應先走前以裝虛法，使拍球前來之一敵，停止拍球，然後急退，緊防籃下之敵。並以且退且擺動兩手之法，裝腔作勢，驚擾持球之敵，延誤其傳球及投籃之時機，以待同伴趕來相一，或從中拿獲其傳球。査此種守法，極為費力，亦不易防守。故遇此情形，其他同學隊員，方不致陷於危局也。</p>
<p>對拍球之敵防守法</p>
<p>對拍球前進之敵，防守之法，聆站位置，應在拍球者與籃之當中。跟隨敵人跑，且跑且儘可能，壓迫其近於邊綫或塲角，使共陷於困境，不易投籃與傳球。倘能與敵併肩而跑，則可乘其不備之際，奪取其球，專球之法，宜以與敵身較近之一手，伸入敵拍球之手下，接續其拍球。將球拍出，拍時宜比敵拍得更低更快，拍出之後，即以轉身擋敵，以免被奪回。當奪球時，手不宜在敵拍球之手上拍下，否則非特球為敵手擋住，不易奪得；且每易擊着敵手而犯規，不可不留意。倘拍球者迎面而來，欲衝過我前者，此時敵必將球急行低拍。故防守者，亦宜屈膝灣身體防守。遇其拍得太低，而失去球之管制時，即可專其球。若遇敵拍球前進投籃，此時宜佔守內圈，隨同其跑，直至敵躍起投籃時，與之同時躍起，在球出敵之手射，將拍球出，使不能投入，躍起時宜使身體面向敵人，避免接觸，以離敵較遠之一手拍球。例如：敵在右邊籃角投，宜用左手拍其球，在左邊籃角投，則宜用右手拍也。此種截球法，若能右跳起時，時間準確，甚屬輕而易舉，萬無一失之防禦法也。</p>
<p>對旋轉之敵防守法</p>
<p>對防守旋轉之敵，是相當困難之舉。故防守之人，必須機驚而敏捷，能預為判斷敵之動向，不受其裝虛動作取斯騙，片刻不放鬆敵人。尤其是敵在籃邊，或在罰球區，欲行旋轉之時，査此二地點，為攻守雙方必爭之地，故非嚴防不可。嚴防之法可分述如下：</p>
<p>（甲）嚴防籃邊敵旋轉之法</p>
<p>敵在籃邊旋轉，其目的為脫離防守者之監視，以便乘機衝前。在籃角躍趨投籃，故防守者，宜緊愼其裝虛轉身逃脫，必須預為斷定其眞動向，儘可能壓迫敵近於邊綫，固守籃前與敵相間之陣地，兩足宜分立，兩臂宜張開，使其不易在身邊衝過。倘敵離開·退近塲邊或塲而引我近前。此時應留意其行阻擋法，被第二敵人走來，將巳擋住，同時應警　其他同伴，嚴守罰球區之空隙，使持球之敵，無法逃出。拍球投籃，或將球傳與籃前之敵投人，在此種形勢，若不能將敵之球奪得，至少亦須壓迫敵人，將球傳回後方，始可謂　嚴防之責也。</p>
<p>（乙）嚴防籃前敵旋轉之法</p>
<p>當敵站在籃前，近罰球綫之處。此敵必係欲接得傳球後，行轉身投籃，故宜嚴防之。防守之法，應站在敵身傍，以一手伸在敵前，一手放在敵身後使之不易接球。迨至敵接得球後，即須立在其身後，此時不宜奪取其球，宜預備其虛騙，左右旋轉逃脫。或躍起轉身投籃，所站位置，應隨敵旋轉之方向而變動，幷須留意持球者，善用何手投籃。若其善用右手者，必先向右或向上虛裝，乘防守者被騙離開位置，即行向左方旋轉逃脫投籃，若其善用左手者，則反是。故須預為猜斷敵之眞實動向，確定其開始投籃之時，方始動手堵截。若能在敵後裝兇作勢，以裝織還以裝虛，可使敵心慌意亂，不易投籃，而將球傳回後方。若敵欲行跳起轉身投籃，此時應與敵同時跳起，高舉兩手截獲其球。但在此種嚴防之下，敵或不自行轉身投籃，而將球傳與兩邊籃角走前之敵，故其他同伴，應協力加以防守之，方能使敵無虛可乘也。</p>
<p>十，個人防守要訣</p>
<p>當本隊失球時，應急行退守。</p>
<p>常佔據內圈而守，站在敵與籃之當中，以便球與人兼顧。</p>
<p>防守時，兩足分立，兩臂橫張開，遇敵持球，則以一手高舉在敵前，擋住其投籃或傳球之路綫，幷不斷以手擺動，使敵心慌，擾亂其視綫。</p>
<p>常以足跟離地站立，以便隨時可向任何方向急行起跑</p>
<p>除在籃前外，一切防守站立姿勢，宜屈膝　體，準備堵截與專球。</p>
<p>勿兩足立穩而轉身，宜提起一足轉。</p>
<p>常釘緊敵人，與敵同時停與跑。</p>
<p>若對方採用「人釘人」，及阻擋進攻法，宜迅速調換防守位置，以抵禦之。</p>
<p>與拍球前進之敵，併肩而跑，可乘機將球在其手下拍出。</p>
<p>緊記着，一切防守法，動足勝於動手。</p>

<p>— 梅必賢</p>
<p>足球界像戴麟經，賈幼良，孫錦順，李義臣，籃球界　李震中，沈聿恭，孔廣益，瞿錫麟，女籃球像容淑儉，黃明媛，李　芝，鄧琇椿等等，都有悠久的歷史，為一輩球迷所熟稔。當然——這一般老將們，我們所希望及鼓勵者，應次於一般小將們。茲者足籃球世界的刋　，屢屢　稿，筆者旣以公私　身，抑且身體多恙，用　維艱，盛情難却，不得已故擇此題，寫年來新成名之足籃球健將，球塲觀感所得，聊亦為寓提掖後進之意。</p>
<p>搜集之下，隨手拈來，大致為足球有韓龍海、李垚、羅壽福、男籃有吳成章、林維聰、何金貴、女籃有嚴蔚雯、謝麗健、詹秀瓊等九人，分述於後，先女後男、以示尊重女權也。</p>
<p>女籃巾幗</p>
<p>（一）嚴蔚雯</p>
<p>是綠隊女籃球隊中鋒，也許有人耍說嚴小姐也是老將，前啓秀三劍客張嘉佩、劉珍寶、嚴蔚雯，固亦喧嚇一時，然而，事實上那時的嚴小姐是三劍客中最弱的一個，身材是短短胖胖的，球路亦不見純熟。目下嚴小姐合度的體格，又經錢旭滄兄的悉心指示，故不論其持球，運球，擲籃，三者俱在水準以上，可稱為最近滬上女籃球標準中鋒，故應列為新人。尤可貴者，嚴小姐球賽時始終笑眯眯地，故有「甜姐兒」之稱，我愛此人之球藝進展，亦佩服其人精神，故列為本篇之第一人。</p>
<p>（二）謝麗健</p>
<p>是華僑隊中的優秀前鋒，謝小姐的特點，是叟手縱身探籃，其姿勢之優美，　球之地位有分寸，求之新人中，不多見也。謝小姐年事正靑，逐塲有顯著的進境，我人可相信謝小姐的藍球威名，必可在短時間內為球迷所稱道。</p>
<p>（三）詹秀瓊</p>
<p>在申報盃籃球聯賽中，方認識這位新人的技術，她參加益康隊，因為有名指導吳十彬的薰陶，詹小姐對於球路是認識得很淸楚，時常我們可以看到該隊用前鋒任寬萍的撞人，詹秀瓊便很迅速地竄人最空隙地位，輕易地建功而返。於此，可見詹小姐頭腦極淸爽，臨陣而能如此，下失為上駟之材，其前途自屬燦爛光明。</p>
<p>男籃三雄</p>
<p>（一）吳成章</p>
<p>當然——玩球的時間，並不短，但一直擠於乙組羣中，遂不為人所注意，及華聯藥廠籃球隊成立，吳君為該隊幹張溎祥所賞識，列為正式陣容之一，乃一經同隊諸老將之琢磨，吳君的本領，便襯託出來，在華聯隊榮獲西靑冠軍及晨友盃申報盃迭顯威風的時候，吳君也隨之有超然的演出。其籃下截球，地位與時間，看得很準，故什得其八九，洵非易易。且長力充沛，全賽奔馳，毫無倦容，為籃球員重要準條件之一。吳君同隊隊員羣呼「阿弟」，可見其方剛之秋，寄語「阿弟」，好事求進，前途豈可限量。</p>
<p>（二）林維聰</p>
<p>也與吳成章同樣的情形，是一向乙組羣中的好手，仁餘作郇子加以靑睞後，即為仁餘隊效勞，旣受余君之啓蒙，竿頭日上，小將一變而為名將，替仁餘隊建下不少功勳。現在被汕隊所羅致，且委以隊長重任，小林誠天之驕子。其優點便是任何角球能够投籃、左右手俱來得，且極有把握，身體玲瓏，速度亦佳，故看守殊難，籃球前鋒中之最標準人材也。</p>
<p>（三）何金貴</p>
<p>何君之地板功夫，堪與馮念華全盛時代媲美，人雖矮小，但彈性頗好，乃並不以矮而吃虧，何之讓人騰空一托，及猛竄籃下帶拍即擲，姿勢之美麗，動作之神速，即證明何之地板功夫。素　華南隊，該隊有籃球界小霸王之稱，何君大有功焉。第三屆籃球聯賽，華南隊無形星散，小何之球藝，將與我人暌隔一時矣。</p>
<p>白袍小將</p>
<p>（一）韓龍海</p>
<p>龍海為東華效勞已久，前踢中衛綫，及足聯會第一屆聯賽，東華以中衛人材較多，龍海即任右內鋒，極顯矯健，活潑玲瓏，不可捉摸。其奔跑之速，咄咄逼人，洋人相顧失色，類多畏之，東華上屆保持常勝，龍海之猛竄建功，大有關係。唯因盛名之累，易為對方注意，故　來時受嚴密監視，使龍海無用武之地為苦。</p>
<p>（二）李垚</p>
<p>一季成名之左翼，且為海上僅有之左翼，即李垚是也。李君為東華試左翼之初，人皆不敢　與重望，不料在孫錦順提携之下，技術大進，脚頭犀利”膽識漸增，乃臨大敵而不慌，體力充沛，陷苦戰而不倦。環觀滬上中外各隊中，無此左翼良材，故迭被選滬巿代表及中華隊代表，僅一季而有如此收穫，李垚其殆天材歟？</p>
<p>（三）羅壽福</p>
<p>本屆參加聯誼後，球迷受　且相看，小羅亦似乎不負人所殷望，努力作戰，每塲有良好之表演，博觀衆之一好評。其踢球典型，有謂略似李應堂，亦有謂與名角名將V蘇若相似，確有幾分，按小羅步伐寬大，盤射功失，俱見精良，H機智與賣力，兼而有之，確為前鋒中之好材料也。尙望小羅不驕不餒，加倍努力，登峰造極，有厚望焉。</p>

<h3>Formation of the New Suzuki Cabinet in Japan; Investiture Ceremony Held Last Night; Prime Minister Concurrently Holds Posts of Foreign Minister and Minister of Greater East Asia</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency Telegram) - General Suzuki, who received the imperial mandate to form a cabinet on the night of the 5th, established the foundation for the cabinet formation on the 6th with the assistance of the Army and Navy and the completion of personnel selection in the two ministries.

<h3>Japanese Cabinet Reshuffle; Policy Remains Unchanged</h3>
<p>Central News - Since Prime Minister Koiso formed his cabinet on July 22nd of last year, succeeding the Tojo Cabinet, he has dealt with the serious war situation and handled national affairs. After eight and a half months, he has now entrusted the national administration to General Suzuki and submitted his resignation en masse.</p>
<p>With the enemy Americans approaching Okinawa Island from Ryukyu Island again, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing are making various speculations about the Japanese cabinet reshuffle, or fantasizing that this is a further step towards Japan's defeat. and express extreme joy. However, the reshuffle of the Japanese cabinet is completely different in purpose from the reshuffles of other countries. Japan's path has been shown in the declaration of war. Although this policy has undergone several cabinet reshuffles, it will not change in the slightest. The only thing is to take more effective methods to move towards this goal.</p>
<p>Since the start of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese cabinet has been reshuffled three times. The Tojo Cabinet resolutely declared war on the United Kingdom and the United States in order to seek self-preservation and self-defense and to promote the stability of East Asia. Since the start of the war, it has worked hard to rectify the wartime situation in the country and finally completed its mission. Last July, in order to refresh people's minds and complete the war, the cabinet was given to Prime Minister Koiso. Prime Minister Koiso took "Great Harmony and Unity" as his slogan and established a national general mobilization system to deal with the war situation.</p>
<p>During his tenure, Prime Minister Koiso implemented policies such as creating the Supreme War Guidance Council, having the Prime Minister attend the Imperial General Headquarters meetings, and ensuring that the military districts and local councils were closely integrated. He also established a system in which 100 million people participated in the war, inspiring national morale, strengthening military production, and completing the deployment of national volunteer corps. All of these tasks have also been completed.</p>
<p>The domestic situation in Japan is looking forward to the emergence of a cabinet that can issue orders to the people across the country and lead them to fight to the end. Therefore, Prime Minister Koiso submitted his resignation en masse in this hope. Now the Japanese people's anti-enemy mentality is even more激昂, and they are determined to fight to the last person and will not stop until the United Kingdom and the United States stop. This can be said to be the progress of Prime Minister Koiso's policy.</p>
<p>General Suzuki Taro, the naval admiral who will be the new prime minister, is currently the president of the Privy Council and is one of the most important ministers. During his fourteen years in the Navy, he successively served as Vice Minister of the Navy, Commander of the Second and Third Fleets, Commander of the Combined Fleet, and Chief of the Naval General Staff. He is one of the veterans of the Japanese Navy. He retired in Showa 4 (1929) and served as a Chamberlain, and in August of last year, he became the President of the Privy Council. He is now 79 years old. During the Qing-Japan War, he led a torpedo squadron into Weihaiwei Bay and was admired for his bravery. At this time of decisive battle, he will lead 100 million people and issue orders.</p>
<p>What the Japanese people currently expect from the government is to concentrate politics on the decisive battle, to closely integrate the commander-in-chief and the people, and to bring the country's total strength to the highest level. Some of these stages have been completed by the Koiso Cabinet, and the Suzuki Cabinet will continue to vigorously promote them, lead the people to rise up and carry out a total assault, and all decisive battle measures will be developed in leaps and bounds. The nationwide unified decisive battle to defeat the enemy will also be launched quickly.</p>
<h3>President Kohiyama Will Fly to Tokyo Today</h3>
<p>Xinjing, 7th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Mr. Kohiyama, the president of Mantetsu, decided to fly to Tokyo by plane on the 8th at the invitation of Kantaro Suzuki.</p>
<h3>The Battle Situation in the Philippines Over the Past Two Months</h3>
<p>When we (Daily News correspondents Kojima and Saikaku) returned to Taiwan, the heroic姿態 of the soldiers of our army and navy garrison still floated in our hearts. Every day, they guarded the ruins of the old city of Manila, braving the continuous bombing of enemy planes and the 10,000 or so huge shells every day, and launched a magnificent charge against the American troops hiding behind the flame throwers, constantly achieving great results. This time, due to operational needs, we carried out a transfer of defense. On 〇月〇日, we went north from Manila. We伏臥 in the fields during the day and slept in the mountains. At night, we sometimes used trucks and sometimes walked on foot. We continued the night march for more than 1,000 kilometers, and the soldiers of the Imperial Army endured hardships. Now, the two of us have finally returned to Taiwan. On the Luzon Island battlefield, the Imperial Army is displaying a tragic and magnificent charge, causing the enemy Americans to suffer countless losses. Now, the enemy's casualties have reached more than 70,000. The formal war of attrition is still ahead. Under the威揚 of enemy planes, the Japanese soldiers absolutely trust General Yamashita's "Yamashita tactics" of剝皮折骨 and斩草除根. The morale is very strong, and they all believe that "the formal war of attrition is still ahead." I would like to report on the actual situation of the Luzon operation that I personally experienced on the northern front for two months since the enemy Americans landed in Lingayen.</p>
<p>The obvious fact seen in the Luzon Island operation is that the Japanese Air Force, which has been assisting the army in intercepting the enemy, has been constantly appearing. We watched the enemy planes in the air raid shelter and thought several times that if there were more planes on the Luzon battlefield, "the American devils would definitely be beaten to a pulp." As soon as the enemy planes saw a Japanese soldier or even a truck on the ground, they would rush forward and repeatedly strafe them. Our Japanese tank army, which has enough heavy equipment to耀世界, wanted to rush into the enemy's陣,拼个 "you die or I live", and was therefore considerably restrained. Each of the enemy's tanks had three escort planes protecting the tank like eagles. When the enemy Americans landed in Lingayen, they always used group attack methods, with four planes as a unit, and groups of 20, 30, or 50 planes always disrupting us in the skies over Luzon, reaching more than 1,000 planes every day. Initially, the United States used B24 and B25 medium bombers and P47 fighters as the main force. However, when landing successively in Lingayen using transport ships, P40, P51, and P39 carrier-based fighters were also dispatched. These carrier-based fighters concentratedly bombed the main cities in central Luzon, such as 加已那贊, San Jose, and Tarlac, like demons, turning them completely into scorched earth and injuring many Filipinos. Even if the enemy planes identified our hospitals and ambulance teams, they still carried out low-altitude bombing, which can be said to be inhuman.</p>
<p>Although American planes are so rampant on Luzon Island, our Japanese soldiers are not discouraged at all, but have consumed countless enemy forces. If we divide the decisive battle in the Philippines and the Leyte operation by the particularly heroic charge tactics of the Japanese army, the protagonist of the Leyte operation was the special attack隊 of the air force; but the protagonist of the Luzon Island battlefield, where Japanese planes were greatly insufficient, was the incomparably heroic ground charge隊. The special attack隊 used their own planes to crash into enemy ships. The ground charge隊 is the same as this. On the Luzon Island front, all the Japanese soldiers have become ground special attack隊. They charge towards the enemy's陣, forcing the enemy to consume the most troops. What the enemy fears most is the human losses that the Imperial Army inflicts on them. Therefore, on the Luzon battlefield, our Japanese soldiers, although they do not have planes to help the ground troops, there is not a single pessimist. The ground warriors said: "During the Leyte operation, the Japanese air force insisted on fighting hard, and now it's our army's turn to charge." The soldiers are smiling and firmly believe in Japan's victory.</p>
<p>The Imperial Army on Luzon Island watched the American troops land on Luzon Island and launched a bold tactic. In the eastern area of Manila, the Clark area, and northern Luzon, the three strategic areas, they will withdraw and shorten the front lines in a way that the American troops cannot quickly pursue. This is General Yamashita's very confident tactic of consuming troops. At that time, we heard a unit commander say豪语壮言: "No planes are needed in the Luzon operation." We did not dare to 加信賴. But now, we deeply understand the meaning of the commander of the American troops.</p>
<p>Soon after the American troops landed in Lingayen, Commander A, who was in charge of the Luzon operation at a certain base on the northern front, also said to me about the profound significance of the operation: "If the enemy only enters Manila or Clark, it will become a 　中之鳌." These mysterious words have now come true. The American troops who entered Manila have been mostly killed by our brave and good-fighting Imperial Army. The Manila that the Americans invaded is now being set on fire everywhere, plundered everywhere, and bombarded everywhere, and has long been completely reduced to焦士砾瓦. On the dark streets and alleys, there are hundreds of thousands of Manila citizens who are homeless and crying out for food and warmth. When the enemy started using an airport in the Clark area, the Imperial Army soldiers who were包阁 in the nearby mountains fired巨炮 and launched charges to prevent them from using the airport. When the enemy changed their strategy and made a comeback, there were only greater troop losses. Recently, on the various battlefields of Luzon, the enemy is advancing, and fierce offensive and defensive battles are unfolding between them. This is because the enemy has fallen for our plan. The Japanese soldiers on each line of Luzon Island believe that "killing as many American devils as possible, even if it takes five or ten years of war, we must persevere." They are all burning with incomparably heroic fighting emotions.</p>
<p>The Japanese soldiers fighting on the northern front have built 千旱城, which are difficult to attack and easy to defend, in the mountainous areas to ensure the possibility of a畏期 battle. They are fully confident and have prepared a陣势 of fighting the war. I visited a certain unit that had preserved a whole year's worth of charcoal, which is truly admirable. It is said that cooking with firewood is often discovered by enemy planes, so charcoal was prepared long ago. The warriors in the unit plant pumpkins, eggplants, radishes, etc. in their spare time. This is truly a long-term war態勢.</p>
<p>The Japanese civilians on Luzon Island, in a certain place in 〇〇溪谷, a key point on the northern front, absolutely trust the army's operations, and even women and children help the army in carrying out operations, which is truly a unity of the military and civilians. That is to say, under the command of the army, the Japanese residents prepare for a self-sufficient and self-sufficient life in combat, and form a living material production隊, a living material collection隊, and an industrial self-sufficiency班, etc. The production隊 is engaged in harvesting rice, milling rice, and planting crops, etc.; the collection隊 leads water buffaloes to buy materials. From this point of view, on the current Philippine front, from General Yamashita to women and children, they are completely united and working hard to win the victory.

<h3>Determined to Cooperate with Allied Nations to Seek the Goal of Liberation</h3>
<p>—Statement by Acting Chairman Chen—</p>
<p>Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Acting Chairman Chen issued a statement today, saying: Prime Minister Koiso resigned on his own initiative because he realized that the war situation was becoming increasingly serious and hoped that a more powerful cabinet would emerge. It has now been decided that General Suzuki will continue to form the cabinet. We have infinite respect for the achievements of the Koiso Cabinet, and we have high expectations for the new cabinet. I recall that when the Koiso Cabinet was established in the autumn of last year, the enemy's American counterattack was becoming increasingly fierce. Prime Minister Koiso, with a必胜 belief, aroused the spirit of the Japanese nation to决斗, and with a firm determination, implemented the unification of strategic and tactical略. He made the greatest efforts to promote national policy and strengthen combat power. Therefore, in the successive battles in Taiwan, the Philippines, and Iwo Jima, he achieved great results. The突击 of the Special Attack隊 especially demonstrated the spirit of courage and fearlessness. The Japanese nation's determination to protect East Asia and its homeland has been unyielding. During my visit to Japan last winter, I exchanged views with Prime Minister Koiso and deeply knew that if this war cannot be won, the liberation of East Asia will never be realized. The interests and safety of China and Japan are inseparable. No matter how urgent the situation is, the National Government will adhere to its firm belief, cooperate with the Allied nations, and jointly seek liberation. Although there has been a change in the Japanese cabinet this time, there is no difference in the goal of completing the war. General Suzuki is a naval veteran who has served as Commander of the Combined Fleet and is currently the President of the Privy Council. He is not only an authority on strategy, but also has excellent administrative skills. The people who participated in the cabinet formation are also important figures in the Japanese military and political circles. I firmly believe that the new cabinet will be able to promote the implementation of national policies and carry out the decisive battle with a stronger陣容. Based on the goal of seeking liberation together, the National Government will inherit Mr. Wang's legacy, with the determination to live and die together,貫澈 its original intention of participating in the war, and strive to advance in order to 　 the completion of the Greater East Asia War.</p>

<h3>A Perspective on the San Francisco Conference</h3>
<p>— Jin Songsheng</p>
<p>The San Francisco Conference, heavily promoted by the anti-Axis powers, is less than three weeks away from its opening. According to recent overseas telegrams, the anti-Axis powers are staging new infighting dramas before the conference, which further strengthens our doubts about the outcome of the San Francisco Conference and necessitates further exposure.</p>
<p>First, it must be understood that although this conference claims to have more than forty participating countries, such as Turkey, Iran, Syria, Lebanon, and various Central and South American countries, some even declaring war on Germany and Japan in order to participate, the main inviting countries are only the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. They all regard themselves as the leaders of the future international league, hoping to take the lead in this San Francisco Conference. Even the French provisional government under De Gaulle, seeing this situation, announced that it would not be among the inviting countries. The status of other countries in the conference in the future is even more imaginable. Although the anti-Axis powers' intelligence propaganda methods have changed from the Moscow "Four Powers" declaration in the winter of 1942 to the "Five Powers" theory, in reality, as the Information Minister of the Japanese Embassy pointed out in his article "The San Francisco Conference, a Dreamlike Illusion," France under De Gaulle's rule is merely a bastard child of Britain and the United States and will have no independent voice in future international conferences. Even Chongqing, although it has long regarded itself as one of the "Four Powers," has too many internal problems and constant friction with the Communists, so it cannot but be in a passive position in international conferences and cannot be on par with the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. Therefore, this conference is obviously just a tragicomedy led by the three major protagonists, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. The worldwide international organization for postwar peace and security is nothing more than a selfish and self-serving tool monopolized by these three major protagonists.</p>
<p>Secondly, judging from the recent trend of the situation, the contradictions and oppositions between these three major protagonists have become increasingly intense. The most obvious are the Polish representation issue and the voting issue. Because the Soviet Union, seeing the hidden ambitions of Britain and the United States, has shown a cold attitude towards the San Francisco Conference, a product of the Crimean Conference. Contrary to the high spirits of Britain and the United States, it has shown calmness in its domestic and foreign intelligence and public opinion organs. It has also disregarded the strength of the delegations of various countries attending the San Francisco Conference and only sent a group of diplomats considered "unqualified" in the eyes of Britain and the United States to perfunctorily deal with the matter. Regarding the Polish issue, it also issued a strong statement, supporting the Polish provisional government in Warsaw must have the right to attend the conference. Regarding the voting issue, it also strived for the privilege of three votes for one country. However, Britain and the United States, in addition to recognizing that the Soviet Union's Ukraine and Belarus each have one vote, have rejected the Polish representation, and British and American public opinion has published articles criticizing the Soviet Union's attitude. Due to the increasingly serious opposition between these three major protagonists, foreign telegrams have reported that the San Francisco Conference will be postponed until this summer, and the United States has also suggested that the five powers hold a meeting in Washington before the San Francisco Conference. This further proves the deepening of the contradictions between the three major protagonists.</p>
<p>The significance of the San Francisco Conference, at best, is to create a new international league under the leadership of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, based on the military force of the three countries, and to place small countries in a subordinate position to jointly suppress the Eastern and Western Axis powers. Due to the increasingly acute contradictions between the three countries, the reality of their ambitions is very doubtful, and the crisis of world disputes is an inevitable trend. Therefore, as the Information Minister of the Japanese Embassy, Mr. An, said: "The conference, which will be held in San Francisco on April 25th, boasting of establishing world peace, is nothing more than a continuation of the war."</p>
<h3>Enemy Ships Around Okinawa Continue to be Sunk, 21 Destroyed, Fierce Battle Unfolding Around Oyama</h3>

<h3>All East Asians Cooperate to Strive for Freedom and Independence</h3>
<p>Li Shaogeng, the Ambassador of Manchukuo, recently made a special trip from Beijing to Shanghai to pay his first visit to the heads of various Chinese and Japanese authorities in Shanghai after taking office. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, he, together with Minister Zhongshan You, received reporters from various Chinese and Japanese newspapers in the city on the ninth floor of the Hua Mao Hotel on the Bund in Nanjing Road. Also present were Major General Iwu, Counselor Ito, Counselor Takenouchi, Secretary Fu, and others. Consul General Ye Yaogong, Officer Yu Wenjingyi, and more than 20 reporters from various newspapers also attended from the Consulate General. First, Ambassador Li gave his impressions after taking office and the construction situation of Manchukuo in the past 13 years. He also hoped that China, Japan, and Manchukuo would further strengthen their close cooperation in the future to achieve the final victory of Greater East Asia. Then, he answered various questions raised by the reporter group until 3:30 PM.</p>
<p>Close Ties Between China and Manchukuo</p>
<p>Ambassador Li said first: "This is my first time in Shanghai since arriving in China to meet with various parties. Shanghai is the most important city in China and also an important corner of East Asia. Therefore, it is necessary to further strengthen contact with all parties in the future. Since arriving in China, I have been eager to visit Shanghai, but because of the busy official duties since taking office, I was only able to meet with you today in February, which I sincerely apologize for. In recent days, I have had many earnest talks with the heads of various Chinese agencies and the Japanese military in Shanghai. I am grateful that all parties have expressed deep assistance to Manchukuo in the future and hope that Shanghai will further cooperate in the cooperation between China and Manchukuo. I am very pleased to have the assistance of the United States and Manchuria. Although all construction in Manchukuo has not been on the ideal track for more than ten years since its founding, there has indeed been progress in general. This is really the result of the close cooperation between Japan and Manchuria. At the same time, we have received considerable cooperation from China, especially the assistance of the North China authorities. Therefore, in the future, we hope that China and Manchukuo will further strengthen their close ties, and that China, Japan, and Manchukuo will work closely together. Manchukuo has made full efforts, and the new China should also make special efforts. When I was in Nanjing, I had many earnest talks with your country's government and saw its great efforts to dedicate itself to the Greater East Asia War. Now, due to various relationships, China has not yet been able to fully realize peace, but the National Government's spirit of hard work and the sincerity of the officials and people are united as one, which is no less than Manchukuo. I am very optimistic about its ability.</p>
<p>East Asian Revival Can Resist Foreign Insults</p>
<p>Today, the war is becoming increasingly tense, and all East Asian nations should mobilize and work hard, then it will not be difficult to overcome difficulties. The revival of the entire East Asian nation is powerful enough to resist foreign aggression. In the past, East Asian countries were oppressed by the West, so they demanded freedom and independence for East Asia. This is the responsibility of the East Asians themselves. Regardless of the peace of the Chinese National Government and the "resistance" of Chongqing, the independence of Manchukuo, and the successive independence of countries such as the Philippines, Thailand, Myanmar, and India, the reason is that they have suffered the oppression of the white race for hundreds of years. Today, our yellow race should open a new situation. We demand freedom and independence, and we should rise up to transform the situation, strive for the same self-reliance as the Westerners, and fight more strongly for the freedom and power that nature has given us to achieve the final goal and complete the greatest goal. Then we must all cooperate to seek independence and resist the Westerners. Regarding Japan's leadership in building East Asia, some people suspect that Japan has the ambition to invade East Asia, which is similar to that of the Westerners. I can guarantee that it is absolutely not the case. We can see that Japan is cooperating in building Manchukuo, and this doubt has been completely dispelled, and there is absolutely no ambition to invade. Today, not only is Manchukuo's politics on track, but all domestic construction is advancing rapidly. For example, Japan and Manchukuo's economic cooperation in developing industries and investing in mutual assistance is quite large.</p>
<p>United Solidarity, Bright Future</p>
<p>If the enemy benefits from this war, no matter China or any East Asian nation, especially those who want to seek equality, the difficulties will be even greater. As for the Western countries' concept, they only care about their own interests and plans, and they will never consider the East Asians. The East Asian people are a nation with rich morality. Japan is the only country that is a friend. Recently, the San Francisco Conference lured Chongqing to attend, which is sweet talk and deception, and is quite dangerous in the future. Britain and the United States are trying to win over Chongqing to destroy the East Asian group. If one billion nations are united to defend against the white race, there will be no problem. If the East Asian nations are broken up one by one, the future of East Asia will be in danger, and we should urgently understand and reverse the crisis. When we look at the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, they all have different dreams in the same bed and are seeking their own interests. Although they are now using Chongqing, they are falsely using the resources of the Chinese people, and the result will eventually be sacrifice. Before the outbreak of the U.S.-Japan war, the United States tried its best to provide material assistance to Japan, while deceiving China, hoping that the snipe and the clam would fight, and the fisherman would benefit. Therefore, Chongqing should urgently reflect and think about the entire East Asian nation, and should not kill each other. For countries such as Manchukuo, Japan has a great understanding of Manchuria, and Manchuria also has a very clear understanding of the Japanese Yamato nation. Over the years, they have cooperated sincerely and have become good friendly countries. Japan's sincere and moral spirit is truly admirable. I hope that everyone will unite, and there will be a bright future.</p>

<h3>Reporter's Meeting Raises Questions on County Administration Improvement; Deputy Director Tan of the County Administration Office Answers</h3>
<p>The eleventh reporter's meeting hosted by the Municipal Propaganda Office was held yesterday (7th) at 2:30 PM in the Municipal Government conference room. More than ten reporters from various newspapers attended. First, Director Liu introduced the new Director of the Municipal County Administration Office, Cai Shun, and Deputy Director Tan Shuzhan. Subsequently, Deputy Director Tan answered various questions raised by the reporters from the newspapers, lasting for over an hour. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Policy Implementation</p>
<p>(Question) What is the recent policy implementation situation of the County Administration Office? (Answer) Since its establishment on March 1st, the former兼Director has been very concerned about the improvement of administration in various counties and districts. He drafted the "Outline for Strengthening County Administration" in preparation for implementation. This outline provides concrete suggestions for adjusting the structure of various county-level organizations, reorganizing personnel, promoting efficiency in official document processing, and improving administrative affairs related to civil affairs, finance, construction, education, and public security. For example, raising the salaries of county administration staff, training district chiefs and assistant administrators, rectifying official discipline, strictly enforcing clean governance, reforming the collection of land tax in kind, eliminating irregular Qianzhuang (traditional Chinese banks) notes, repairing roads and bridges, establishing agricultural experiment fields, increasing production, establishing county-level hospitals or clinics, increasing the number of rural primary schools, training police and self-defense corps, and strengthening the people's self-defense forces are all under planning. This outline has now been submitted to the Municipal Government for review and approval. Once approved, it will be ordered to the county governments for implementation. In addition, in order to strengthen public security in various counties and districts, the office convened a public security discussion meeting on March 22nd, gathering county magistrates and district heads to make decisions on ensuring public security in the counties and districts. However, since the office was newly established, the focus of its policy implementation has been on investigating local conditions, formulating county administration improvement policies, and increasing administrative efficiency in counties and districts.</p>
<p>Increased Production Campaign</p>
<p>(Question) Is the increased production campaign being carried out in the various counties, and what products are the focus? (Answer) The various counties of this city have always attached importance to increased production work and have established agricultural production promotion committees responsible for promoting it. At the same time, cooperative societies in various counties are also making efforts to assist. The focus of increased production is rice and cotton. Recently, the office has also listed vegetable production as a key focus for increased production in various counties and has concrete implementation plans. It is expected that there will be a relatively large harvest this year.</p>
<p>Strictly Prohibiting Gambling</p>
<p>(Question) Gambling is rampant in the suburban townships. Does your office have a thorough way to eliminate it? (Answer) Regarding the gambling situation in the suburbs of the city, the office received reports after its establishment, especially in the Zhoupu Xinchang Dawei area of Nanhui County. It was also learned that some cunning people organized so-called "silver groups," issuing a kind of illegal "Shen Dan" (betting slips) to replace coding, which led to ignorant farmers losing their fortunes. After obtaining concrete information, the office immediately ordered the Nanhui and Chuansha county governments to thoroughly investigate and prohibit it, and to investigate and report the main culprits for punishment. In the future, if gambling revives in any county or district, it will be thoroughly eliminated without any leniency.</p>
<p>Rectifying Police Discipline</p>
<p>(Question) It is rumored that the discipline of the police in various counties is poor, and extortion occurs from time to time. What is the truth? (Answer) In the past, the salaries of the police in the various counties of this city were extremely low. For example, the salaries of police officers in Nanhui and Chuansha were only 90 yuan per month. The salaries of police officers in Chongming, Fengxian, and Jiading were relatively higher, but even then, the monthly salary was only around 900 yuan. Extortion was inevitable. Now that police affairs have been assigned to the office, special attention will be paid to rectifying police discipline. If there are concrete facts reported from any side, the office will definitely punish them according to the law. In order to thoroughly rectify police discipline, Luo, the former兼Director, drafted a proposal to increase police salaries to be equal to those of the security team. This proposal has been submitted to the Municipal Government for review and approval. Once approved, it will be implemented. It is hoped that after the new salary system is implemented, this undesirable phenomenon can be reduced.</p>
<h3>Special Transportation Ship Management Bureau Established Yesterday in Shanghai to Facilitate Shipping and Regulate the Flow of Goods Between North and South</h3>
<p>In order to meet the needs of wartime, facilitate maritime transport, and smooth the flow of goods between the North and the South to achieve economic and material regulation between the two regions, the National Government's War Affairs Committee specially appointed Lieutenant General of the Army, He Enzheng, to organize the Special Transportation Ship Management Bureau to handle wartime material transportation business. The bureau was officially established in Shanghai yesterday (7th) and began operations immediately. It is expected that the completion of maritime transport will make a considerable contribution to suppressing prices in various regions.</p>
<h3>Sugihara Appointed as the Fourth Chief of the Police Bureau</h3>
<p>Wushima Mao, the fourth chief of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, has been approved to resign because he was ordered to be transferred to an important position. Sugihara Eiichi has been appointed to fill the vacancy and will officially take over tomorrow.</p>
<p>Judicial Police Farewell to Wushima</p>
<p>In addition, the third section of the third precinct of the bureau held a farewell tea party for Chief Wushima at the Kangle Restaurant on Jing'an Temple Road yesterday afternoon at 4 PM. Senior police officers, including section chiefs and department heads, attended the party, which was hosted by Chief Li Shiyu. Chief Li and Deputy Chief Guanxian delivered farewell speeches, followed by a thank-you speech from Chief Wushima. Hosts and guests were very happy, and the atmosphere was harmonious. The party ended at about 6 PM.</p>
<h3>Municipal Economic Bureau Strictly Investigates Impersonators of Investigators</h3>
<p>The Municipal Economic Bureau must dispatch personnel to conduct thorough investigations of applications for business registration by industrial and commercial enterprises before approving the issuance of business licenses. The supervision of all investigators in field missions is particularly strict. All dispatched personnel performing their duties must wear employee badges and carry a special yellow attendance card. However, on the 27th of last month, a person claiming to be Wang Yiming, an employee of the Economic Bureau, went to Zhu Maosheng Noodle Shop at 112 Songpan Road to conduct an investigation and demanded a handling fee of 3,500 yuan, promising to expedite the issuance of a registration certificate. Unexpectedly, when the inspector dispatched by the bureau on the same day went to investigate with his credentials, the shop realized it had been deceived. The bureau's inspector immediately returned to the bureau to report and dispatched personnel to secretly investigate and deal with the matter. At the same time, it notified all merchants and residents that if personnel dispatched by the bureau come to investigate and cannot produce an attendance card, they should refuse the investigation to avoid being deceived.</p>

<h3>Taishan Police Sub-Bureau Strictly Prevents Thieves and Bandits; Bamboo Fences Are Set Up Around the Jurisdiction</h3>
<p>The Taishan Police Sub-Bureau, in view of the fact that the area is located in the center of the city, is the most prosperous area of the former French Concession, and there are many entertainment venues, the people who come and go are of mixed quality, and after the merger of the city, all the iron gates of Kunshan and Nanshi were opened, and it was easier for thieves and escaped soldiers to escape, and theft cases have emerged in recent three or four months. In order to strengthen police affairs, the sub-bureau has repeatedly planned preventive countermeasures to curb theft. Therefore, after consulting with the Baojia (neighborhood watch) aspect, it was agreed to cooperate, set up bamboo fences around the jurisdiction, and close the iron gates of the alleys on time, and densely deploy detectives in various entertainment venues. Once a theft occurs, all intersections in the area will be closed at the same time, and detectives will conduct anti-theft training from time to time to prevent it secretly, curb theft, and hope that citizens will cooperate to maintain local security.</p>
<p>Captured Bandit</p>
<p>At about 6 PM on the 29th of last month, the infamous bandit Jian Genrong, armed with a large Dum Dum-style revolver pistol, sneaked into Guoxing Secondhand Shop on Luoyang Road and stole valuable items such as diamond rings, and fled by car with the loot. The shop assistants and self-defense team members blew the whistle, and the entire area was sealed off. When the thief's car arrived at the Huangpo Road intersection, it was discovered by police officer Ming Fangqing, badge number 524, who was on duty there, and was arrested on the spot.

In February of this year, Mr. Ren (Mr. Zhu Chengshi's name) sent a letter to the office, saying that at the beginning of the year, the poor were threatened by life, displaced, and cried out in hunger and cold. They need to be relieved. Mr. Ren was saddened and worried about it. He asked himself that he was still well-fed and clothed. He sent one three-carat diamond ring, one five-carat diamond ring, and one 18K gold watch to the office for auction, with a starting price of 300,000 yuan. The proceeds would be donated to the office's social welfare funds, and he hoped that people from all walks of life would participate in the charity event to make it a success, so as to promote the effectiveness of relief, etc. The news was published to call on people from all walks of life to sell it for charity, but until now, no owner has been found. Mr. Ren then generously spent 300,000 yuan to donate himself and took back the original items. Mr. Ren has a heart for the hungry and the suffering, and his enthusiasm for public welfare is a model for the society. It is specially allocated to donate 100,000 yuan to the Yixue (free school) fund, 50,000 yuan each to the midwifery fund and the small loan fund, and 25,000 yuan each to the poverty relief fund, the medical aid fund for primary school teachers, the medical aid fund, and the fund for poor children. The total is the above amount, and we express our gratitude.</p>
<h3>Contributing Money and Efforts to Help the Yixue Fund</h3>
<p>Letter from Students of Yisheng Primary School</p>
<p>All the fifth and sixth grade students of the private Yisheng Primary School wrote a letter saying: "Today, our senior teachers, Mr. Zhou and Mr. Yan, reported on the Memorial Week: 'Because the cost of living has been rising recently, and more and more children are out of school, although our principal, Mr. Hu, has opened a compulsory primary school in our school, the school building is limited and cannot accommodate as many students as possible. At the same time, we are feeling the lack of Yixue (free school) in our city. Now that we have heard the news that the newspaper office is sponsoring the establishment of ten compulsory primary schools and that Mr. Xie Lilin is launching the "Yixue Fund", our school teachers are very sympathetic. After hearing this, our children were also very excited. We are all willing to do a little bit to help your museum and complete the unprecedented enthusiasm for the whole compulsory education. We have spent a few days' worth of snack money, so those who have money can donate money, those who have books can donate books, and those who have strength can donate to the outside world. As a result, we raised 73,000 yuan in storage coins and 40 old books. A list of donors is attached. We are all primary school students and know that our economic strength is weak. In order to relieve the suffering of out-of-school children and respond to the enthusiasm of your newspaper, we hope that people from all walks of life will unite to complete this great charity, and we hope that your newspaper will disclose this letter, and we are very grateful.'"</p>

<p>Travel Communication</p>
<h3>From Shanghai to Hefei</h3>
<p>— Xu Ming</p>
<p>In mid-March, I, the author, traveled to Hefei alone with two pieces of luggage. The entire journey was approximately 1,700 li (approximately 850 km). The conditions encountered along the way, witnessed firsthand, are worth recording.</p>
<p>The route taken to Hefei this time was as follows: from Shanghai, via Nanjing, Pukou, Bengbu, and Shuijiahu, to Luzhou (i.e., Hefei). The Nanjing to Pukou section involved taking a ferry across the Yangtze River, and the Shuijiahu to Hefei section was on a "Huazhong Transport" bus. The rest of the journey was by train. The Bengbu to Shuijiahu section is the new Huainan Railway line, completed in July of last year.</p>
<p>The difficulty of buying tickets at Shanghai Station surpasses that of other places. Due to the high cost of food, many want to return to their hometowns but are unable to do so. Readers can surely witness the ticket-squeezing crowds in front of the Transport Cooperative at the intersection of North Nanjing Road. According to information in Shanghai, there are two places to purchase train tickets from the city:</p>
<p>North Station. Only sells tickets to stations along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, does not sell connecting tickets.</p>
<p>Nanjing Road Transport Cooperative. There are three ticket-buying queues: (A) Japanese. (B) Military personnel, employees of military industries, and civil servants. Must have a travel permit issued by their organization. (C) Ordinary citizens. Must present a citizen's card.</p>
<p>Because I needed to buy connecting tickets, I joined the C queue at the second location. The process of buying tickets involved three steps: On the first day, queuing and waiting to receive a "number card." This is done once every morning at 9:00 AM, and there are usually less than one hundred numbers issued, with no fixed number. After issuing the card, the citizen's card is taken away. The next day, using the "number card," one queues to obtain an application form, filling in one's name, destination, and citizen's card number. After queuing again, one prepares cash to buy the ticket. Imagine that the opportunity to buy a ticket is so scarce, and the procedure so cumbersome; how can travelers not be daunted?</p>
<p>After endless waiting, I finally managed to get a train ticket. Before boarding, I checked my bedding as luggage. As for my suitcase, I preferred to bear the physical and financial burden of carrying it with me to prevent it from getting lost. Because it was a night train, I arrived at Nanjing Xiaguan at five o'clock the next morning. After getting off the train, I urgently needed to wait for my luggage. Blue tickets could be used for connecting journeys, but luggage could not be transferred, and I needed to catch the Jinpu express train at 9:00 AM, so I was anxious. After waiting anxiously until 8:30 AM, an air raid alarm suddenly sounded, and Xiaguan Station was instantly deserted. I hired a car to hide under the Zhongshan Bridge because the riverbed was permanently dry and the bridge foundation was solid, making it a suitable place to seek shelter.</p>
<p>After the air raid alarm was lifted, I retrieved my luggage and crossed the river. It was already past 9:00 AM, but fortunately, the train was delayed, and I was still able to catch it. The porter fees for carrying luggage across the river were shocking, totaling 6,000 yuan in four instances. Adding the 2,000 yuan car fare to escape the air raid, this was more than enough for a fast train ticket from Shanghai to Bengbu. Such an expense for ten minutes on the river was truly unexpected, and the inspection was strict. If the China Railway authorities could allow luggage transfers, the inconvenience to travelers would definitely be reduced. This is an easy matter, as the luggage crossing the river will inevitably have to cross the river anyway.</p>
<p>The Jinpu express train was originally scheduled to depart from Pukou at 9:00 AM, but it was delayed until 9:00 PM. In the meantime, there were two more air raid alarms. Because I had luggage with me and no rickshaw to hire, I could only resign myself to fate.</p>
<p>The crowding on the Jinpu train was even worse than on the Shanghai-Nanjing train. Because Japanese women and children were traveling that day, the number of train cars was reduced, and the overcrowding was indescribable. The air quality inside the train cars was unbearable. Many people were vomiting and dizzy. As for lice crawling on people's shoulders, this was a common sight. The cries of women and children were constant. The slow speed of the train was unbelievable. It took eleven hours to travel from Pukou to Bengbu, while the scheduled time was only four hours.</p>
<p>The first thing that surprised me upon arriving in Bengbu was the low cost of food. Rice here was 35,000 yuan per dan (approximately 50 kg), but it was a large dou (unit of measurement). Flour was 120 yuan per jin (approximately 500g), eggs were 100 yuan for three, and beef was 180 yuan per jin. Fried dough sticks and pancakes were 60 yuan per serving. The dough sticks were large, two inches in diameter and fourteen inches long. The pancakes were also "large," thick and substantial. Compared to those in Shanghai, it was like a giant seeing a dwarf.</p>
<p>In Bengbu, I boarded a car to Shuijiahu. The crowding on this route was better, but there were many small peddlers. Before the Huainan Railway was rerouted, Shuijiahu was a small station. After the rerouting last year, connecting to Bengbu, the old line was dismantled up to this point, and the new line was built from here. Therefore, those going to Hefei had to pass through this station. The road from Shuijiahu to Hefei was rebuilt from the old Huainan Railway line after its dismantling, so the road surface was very narrow, and two cars could not pass side by side. There was one bus to Hefei every morning at 9:00 AM, and the price was surprisingly high, 7,000 yuan for 180 li. Compared to the 500 yuan train ticket from Bengbu to Shuijiahu, it was shocking. Therefore, peddlers carried their goods on foot along the road, one after another. The car arrived in Hefei at 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>This trip took five days and cost 30,000 yuan. (Moved to support education)</p>

<h3>The Great Strategist General Yamashita</h3>
<p>— Ikeda Genji</p>
<p>Currently, on the entire battlefield of the Philippines, the Japanese army is carrying out fierce bayonet charges and has achieved a great victory, killing more than 70,000 enemies, plunging the enemy into a quagmire of suffering. During the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, the "fierce Yamashita offensive" in the Battle of Singapore was experienced, but the general public does not yet know much about this fierce general's "strong and flexible Yamashita strategy."</p>
<p>What exactly is the "defensive Yamashita strategy"? To understand this, one must first know the general's life and personality - the general has no children. When he was in Manchuria, he treated the local boys as if they were his own children, teaching them the methods of study, saying, "You are truly hardworking children. Diligent preparation is enough; there is no need to review." This was the rule he followed from elementary school, to youth school, to the Army Officer School, to the Army University, putting it into practice himself.</p>
<p>"Battles cannot be revised. Therefore, the most important thing before a battle is thorough preparation."</p>
<p>This was the general's perspective from his youth. Possessing this perspective and belief, he has never revised it, nor has he ever failed, from the time he was a young officer until he became a general.</p>
<p>Yamashita's Flexible Strategy</p>
<p>On the Chinese front, whether as a division commander or as a staff officer, the strategy he bravely executed was always the "Yamashita strategy" that defeated the enemy. He was praised as a new strategist even within the military headquarters.</p>
<p>Previously, when the general was the commander of the North China Army, I, as a reporter, had the opportunity to ask him about his opinions on the China Incident. At that time, the general, shaking his imposing frame, said:</p>
<p>"Let's first observe the Chinese! In the midst of war and chaos, even if they are attacked and repeatedly defeated, they do not panic. We Japanese should also be calm and composed, and not be too nervous."</p>
<p>Later, he led a division into the vast Chinese interior, personally experiencing the attack on the Chinese mainland. At the same time, he thoroughly studied and absorbed the Chinese strategy of drawing the Japanese army into their interior.</p>
<p>In the current Luzon Island operation, when the enemy army invaded the Luzon Plain, he said very calmly and with a smile: "The enemy army has already become a part of our belly." With the enemy landing in Luzon and entering the dangerous interior guarded by the elite Japanese army, he naturally smiled inwardly, believing that the enemy would continue to be mired in arduous combat. Since the enemy landed in Lingayen, they did not encounter the expected resistance and, like an overwhelming wave, continued to pursue the Japanese army southward. The enemy lost one-third of their entire landing force in the attack on Manila, while the main force of the Japanese army suffered no losses. MacArthur, taking advantage of the victory in Leyte, wanted to directly attack Luzon, but he fell into the "Yamashita strategy." Perhaps they will suffer the consequences of their own actions!</p>
<p>A Word that Startled Goering</p>
<p>General Yamashita is not only one of Japan's leading strategists but is also a world-renowned great strategist. In the second year of this World War, in 1940, at the invitation of Italy and Germany, the general inspected the new battlefields of the Western Front in detail. At that time, Germany gathered its elite mechanized units, which had shaken the world, in one place and had General Yamashita inspect them. Marshal Goering patted the general on the shoulder and said:</p>
<p>"What are your impressions, Your Excellency?…?"</p>
<p>The general turned his head to look at the large formation of mechanized units and replied casually:</p>
<p>"Oh, it's not as good as I expected."</p>
<p>Marshal Goering was startled by the general's great spirit and said:</p>
<p>"Then let's compare it with the Japanese army!"</p>
<p>"Good, that's exactly what I want. Then let's have a decisive battle in the Iranian plateau or the Afghan area!"</p>
<p>"Ha! Ha! Ha!…"</p>
<p>The two heroes embraced and laughed.</p>
<p>After the general returned from inspecting the German and Italian fronts, during the period before he became the supreme commander of the Singapore occupation army, he continuously studied in practice the strategy of defeating highly mechanized units, and finally invented the so-called "Yamashita flexible strategy."</p>
<p>Waiting for the Decisive Battle</p>
<p>Recently, the general has been researching a strategy to crush highly mechanized units with thousands of tanks and thousands of aircraft using limited equipment, limited troops, and limited resources. So the regret of this strategy is that a part of air supremacy is temporarily in the hands of the enemy. However, the enemy, who has the advantage in numbers, has already suffered our attacks, resulting in a loss of as many as 70,000 people, while our main force has not suffered the slightest damage. This is the success of the Yamashita tactics.</p>
<p>The general, who possesses a fervent fighting spirit and firm confidence, will surely launch a major annihilation battle when the time is right. This is the general's indomitable character.</p>
<p>But when will this huge annihilation battle be launched? That is when the anxious enemy is about to launch a mainland landing operation, when their replenishment is difficult, and when the balance of power between the enemy and us is broken again.</p>
<p>Now the enemy's ships are already insufficient. They are anxious to fight a quick battle and hope to forcibly land in various places. When the enemy's replenishment is already lacking and the enemy's combat power is already weakened, this is known to all. This is when the balance of power between the enemy and us in the Philippines is broken, and it is the best opportunity for the Yamashita army to launch a major annihilation battle.</p>
<p>Whether in Taiwan, or in China, in South China, or even in Japan in the future, if the enemy advances further, they will always use the "Yamashita flexible strategy," which makes people cry out in alarm, causing them to pay the greatest price in blood and flesh. The time for the "Yamashita flexible strategy" to shine is at hand. (Lin Tan from the March 15 Asahi Shimbun).</p>
<h3>The Imminent Opening of the Battle of Berlin</h3>
<p>— Berlin Correspondence</p>
<p>If it weren't for the Nazi Party's drastic reorganization and guidance, all Germans would admit that they would never have been able to hold out until today. However, this view is not entirely correct. Because relying solely on the Party's guidance and encouragement would not have resulted in such a tragic nationwide resistance. Observing the current internal situation in Germany, as it faces the final battle, one can deeply feel the traditional and strong national character inherent in the blood of the German people.</p>
<p>The Final Hour</p>
<p>German territory is already being gradually eroded by the enemy from the east, battered by the rain of bombs dropped from the sky, creating a tragic scene of families torn apart, fathers separated from their children. The difficulty of life is increasing day by day. Millions of men, women, and children, carrying only a blanket, are fleeing from west to east, and from east to west, not knowing where to go. With the entire country of Germany becoming a battlefield, this group of innocent and pitiful children naturally cannot find a haven. Now is the moment when the United Nations wants to use overwhelming military pressure to crush Germany in one fell swoop. In other words, the current war situation for Germany has reached the most severe stage imaginable. But even in this situation, the German people are still holding onto their flag of national struggle. At the same time, they still want to continue fighting. Of course, there is no denying that many people are dissatisfied with their current lives, but as soon as the conscription order is issued, even white-haired old men in their seventies stand up, shoulder their rifles, and go to the battlefield. Now is not the time to consider the fate of tomorrow, or to criticize today's war and satirize politics. The call to persist in resisting to the end fills the entire country. According to Western utilitarianism, this is truly an unbelievable miracle. All the former European Allied countries, in the midst of fierce fighting, abandoned their armor, surrendered, and begged for the enemy's mercy, but Germany, despite being pressured by the armies of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union on all sides, is still resisting with its flag of battle in the heart of Europe, which truly displays the strength of the German nation.</p>
<p>There has been discussion in Germany about where the Soviet troops' tenacious resistance came from. Initially, most people believed that the ideology and organizational power of communism were the reasons for the Soviet Union's victory. However, later, due to several experiences in the Eastern Front, the Germans realized that the Soviet Union's strength stemmed from the innate nature of the Slavic people. The fact that the Germans can persist today can be explained by the same reasoning. Especially the emotions of fighting in other people's territory and fighting in one's own country are vastly different. As the battle line is gradually and repeatedly retreating to the country's own territory, and one sees firsthand the burning of one's own hometown by artillery fire, although the objective situation becomes more unfavorable day by day, the German people's fighting spirit and morale become increasingly strong. Today, all the German people truly experience that this is a war for their own survival. That is to say, the militarism of ordinary soldiers, the so-called spirit of German victory in every battle, the tenacity of the Germanic people, the tradition of past history, and the character of the German people, are all factors that determine this war and are the source of their tenacious resistance.</p>
<p>Two Great Pillars</p>
<p>The Nazi Party is the organization that builds the national resistance consciousness and plays the greatest role in constituting combat power. Therefore, the people's will to fight and the Nazi organization are the two pillars that support Germany in the decisive stage. In other words, it is old Germany and new Germany, and these two pillars support each other. It goes without saying that if either pillar breaks, the war will be lost. Therefore, facing the greatest difficulties today, the interdependence of these two pillars is undeniable. When France was occupied by the American and British troops, and the Soviet Red Army carried out rapid blitzkrieg operations in the Ukrainian territory, these two pillars united as one. However, today, although there are old inherent traditions and new organizations, the two have a close and inseparable relationship. "Fight for the beloved homeland!" This supreme principle is inspiring the solidarity of Nazi Party members and non-Party members, uniting them against external enemies.</p>
<p>The United States and Britain, who induced Italy and other Axis allies to surrender, still do not forget to constantly implement both threats and inducements to the German people. The conspiracy to divide the Party and the people in the past has already failed, but recently it has been re-enacted. For example, at the Crimean Conference, they announced to the German people: "Only the Nazi Party is our public enemy." However, the German people's determination to fight this war has not been shaken. Although there are often inconsistencies and non-cooperative phenomena on the front lines, the surging enthusiasm to desperately make up for failures, and the determination of the rear to endure the greatest sacrifices in order to win victory, are worthy of admiration.</p>
<p>Believing in the Leader</p>
<p>If an enemy asks an ordinary German about the future of the war, saying: "The current war situation has already been largely decided. If you continue to resist meaninglessly, it will only lead to sacrifice. Why not surrender early?" The German would definitely answer:</p>
<p>"We admit that there have been great failures in the leadership of the German war, and that the people have made many mistakes. But we do not admit that President Hitler is an irresponsible politician. A figure like Hitler, who loves Germany so much, would never sacrifice the lives and happiness of the German people and continue a hopeless war. We ordinary people do not know how much military power and combat strength Germany still has. The President knows this very well, so he is still continuing the war. We believe that as long as Hitler is fighting, from a purely military point of view, Germany still has a chance to win. Therefore, we obey the President's orders and go to the battlefield. Besides this, is there any other way for Germany to survive?"</p>
<p>Due to the long period of unfavorable war situation, and under the east-west attack of the Soviet and American-British armies, when considering the fate of Germany, the German people will make the above decision. If you do not recognize the above idea, you will not understand the reason for the current German fierce resistance.</p>
<p>Berlin Defenses</p>
<p>Now, less than fifty or sixty kilometers east of Berlin, is the Oder River, a scene of raging war. The Soviet Union's most elite Zhukov army is on the east side of the Oder River, having completed new formations, new deployments, and replenished ammunition and food, waiting only for the order to launch a major offensive against Berlin. Since the large-scale bombing of Berlin by the US Air Force on February 3, the city of Berlin has truly become a battlefield. The appearance of the city has now changed dramatically and is alarming. The sandbag barricades at the crossroads are increasing day by day. The bustling main streets are also closed to traffic, allowing only military trucks to pass. Due to enemy bombing, there are pieces of iron and roof tiles everywhere, materials used for barricades. Most of those who are desperately transporting these materials and helping with the defenses of Berlin are Soviet prisoners of war in uniform. Next to all the bridges or intersections, members of the People's Stormtrooper, wearing ordinary suits and hats, are carrying rifles, preparing themselves. This clearly shows that martial law has been declared.</p>
<p>Determined to Defend to the Death</p>
<p>The person in charge of the Third War Zone, that is, the highest authority for defending Greater Berlin, was formerly President Hitler, but has now been replaced by the unknown Lieutenant General Heinrici. Lieutenant General Heinrici broadcasted to the citizens of Berlin via radio, and appointed individual defense commanders for the suburbs of Berlin, completely transforming Berlin into a large fortress, preparing to defend the German capital to the death. The lakes, rivers, and mountains in the suburbs have also been fully utilized as natural barriers in the defense plan. We naturally have no freedom to report in detail on the comprehensive defense measures being carried out day and night in the German capital. What we can report is that Berlin will definitely not be declared a non-defended city like Paris and Rome, and have its government agencies move elsewhere for refuge. However, the Zhukov army seventy kilometers to the east is only "reinforcing Berlin" directly even if they launch a major offensive. The metropolis with four million citizens will become an isolated city surrounded by enemy troops in the midst of artillery fire. Refugees fleeing from the Eastern Front are overflowing in Berlin, especially women and children. But the government has not yet ordered an evacuation. Why has it not ordered an evacuation? The main reason is that such a large population cannot find a safer area in all of Germany to accommodate them, and evacuation would be a futile effort. Another reason is that the German government has long considered that abandoning the capital Berlin would have a decisive and serious impact on the entire war. Therefore, the beginning of the Battle of Berlin is likely to be the dividing point that finally determines the fate of Germany. Four million citizens will all participate in this great battle.</p>
<p>When there is no gas, electricity, or tap water, the food for the general public, like the army, will implement a large-scale rationing system. The supreme commander of the Greater Berlin armed citizen group, the "People's Stormtrooper," is Propaganda Minister Goebbels. Now the critical moment for Germany is approaching moment by moment. The Soviet Red Army, centered on the Zhukov army, with the Koniev army on the left and the Rokossovsky army on the right, is about to launch a major battle, preparing like a crane formation. Of course, Germany will never admit defeat and immediately sign a treaty of surrender, so it is currently carefully planning a counter-offensive operation, determined to defend to the death.</p>
<p>High Morale</p>
<p>Based on the resolutions of the Crimean Conference, we can fully imagine that the American and British armies will launch a new offensive on the Western Front in mid-February or early March, and the European war situation will have major decisions in March and April. This estimate cannot be considered arbitrary.</p>
<p>German newspapers and radio stations repeatedly boast that London was also devastated by the German army in 1940 and fell into a state of turmoil. At that time, thanks to the calm response of the British, they overcame the difficulties; Moscow and Leningrad also suffered greatly from the German army, but thanks to the strong character of the Soviet people, they finally turned defeat into victory. Berlin is certainly not preparing to learn from the enemy, but wants to persist and crush their ambitions. These repeated reports are to encourage national morale. The crisis in London at that time still had the hope of the American allied forces joining the war, and the dangerous era in Moscow still had a vast rear area and countless human and material resources to support the war. Britain and the Soviet Union at that time both had something to rely on. But what does Germany rely on today? And what does it intend to rely on? From the perspective of military production alone, the Upper Silesia heavy industrial zone, which has the same value as the Ruhr industrial area, has been lost to the Soviet Union. The military factories in the former Polish colony and Czechoslovakia, the Varta River basin, etc., have also been occupied by the Soviet Union. This loss is truly irreparable. The only savior is the trade relationship with neutral Sweden, but it is gradually deteriorating. According to today's situation, the replenishment of military supplies can only rely on the raw materials stored in the past, and the newly invented weapons can fill some of the losses. There is no other way. Since this compensation is minimal, what Germany relies on is its high morale and excellent operational guidance. As the war situation becomes more and more urgent, national morale is the greatest and final weapon to overcome enemy planes and cannons.

<h3>Map of the European War Situation</h3>
<p>The Eastern and Western fronts in Europe have now entered a decisive stage. On the northern flank of the Western front, anti-Axis forces crossed the Weser River and advanced eastward in the Minden area, aiming for Hanover. In the central area, the American Third Army, after entering the Saarlautern area, encountered fierce resistance from the German army and made little progress. According to a telegram on the 7th: On the Eastern front, Soviet tanks have broken into Old Odor, and on the Warthe River front, Soviet forces have concentrated their forces, and a major battle is imminent.</p>
<h3>Measures that the Business Community Should Take</h3>
<p>— Yushun</p>
<p>Since the soaring price of rice, the business community in this city has suddenly declined; reversing the past state of abnormal prosperity. At this time, business operators should take appropriate measures to cope with the current difficulties. Now, with the intention of offering a humble opinion, I contribute my superficial views below for reference.</p>
<p>Adjusting Work Hours: Currently, the working hours of companies and businesses are approximately six to ten hours, which does not seem to have been shortened compared to previous working hours; even if they have been shortened occasionally, the reduction is only one or two hours. However, the business of companies and businesses is extremely quiet, with the best only reaching half of what it was at its peak. Therefore, if working hours are reduced by half, there should be no problem in handling business, but the following benefits can be obtained: (1) Increase the time for employees to study and engage in side businesses, (2) Reduce the number of times employees travel to and from work, saving manpower and resources, (3) Increase the employees' work remuneration in an intangible way. How to adjust the working hours should be decided by the trade association to ensure uniformity.</p>
<p>Reducing Redundant Personnel: Rather than lingering on with difficulty, companies and businesses should simply reduce unnecessary employees, giving them a considerable amount of severance pay so that they can return to their hometowns to make a living during the authorities' evacuation of the population. Assuming that they continue to drag on in a half-dead state, the company will be drained, and the employees' savings will be exhausted. By that time, even if the company wants to reduce employees, it may not be able to pay a severance pay. At the same time, the dismissed employees, with only a small amount of severance pay, may not even be able to return to their hometowns, let alone use it to start another business.</p>
<p>Increasing Remuneration: Companies and businesses should give reasonable remuneration to retained employees, ensuring that their income can maintain a minimum standard of living, so that they can concentrate on their work, and the company can also rely on this to maintain itself and plan for future development. Remuneration should be changed to a mixed system of in-kind and currency, and in addition to paying salaries on a regular basis, it is best to distribute necessities such as rice, fuel, oil, and salt.</p>
<p>It is indeed not easy to overcome difficulties. Assuming that companies and businesses can consider taking the above-mentioned emergency measures within the scope of possibility, they may be able to overcome the danger safely. It all depends on how it is implemented!</p>
<h3>A Perspective on Material Rationing (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Liu Ningwu</p>
<p>Household Rationing and Special Rationing</p>
<p>Since the implementation of material rationing in Shanghai, it has been divided into two types: household rationing and special rationing. The former uses a voucher rationing system. All taxpayers in the district, with their municipal tax receipts and household registration certificates, apply for vouchers at the voucher issuing office. Citizens can purchase and receive rationed materials at the designated stores according to the announcements of the rationing office. Currently, there are approximately 969 retail rice stores designated by the rationing office, 4 retail water supply stores, approximately 628 coal ball retail stores, and approximately 425 soap and firewood stores. The rationed items include rice, flour, sugar, coal balls, soap, firewood, and milk, which are discussed separately below:</p>
<p>Rice—Rationing is implemented based on the applications of various applicants, such as government agencies, public utilities, hospitals, charities, and factories, after verification.</p>
<p>Flour—Recipients are bakeries, noodle shops, and restaurants approved by the rationing office. The amount of rations they are entitled to is based on the total number of their users.</p>
<p>Sugar—Rationing is implemented based on the quantity approved by the former Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office.</p>
<p>Coal Balls—Recipients are government agencies and charities.</p>
<p>Soap and Firewood—Recipients are hospitals, the Laundry Industry Association, and the Restaurant Industry Association.</p>
<p>Coal by the Catty—Recipients are members of the Boiled Water Industry Association.</p>
<p>Milk—Recipients are hospitals, the elderly, infants, etc.</p>
<p>Points to Note for Future Rationing</p>
<p>Currently, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, Switzerland, and other countries have implemented material rationing systems. Whether they are effective or not is not discussed for the time being. The material rationing system is very important in wartime economic policies. It can not only suppress the rise in prices, but also prevent rampant hoarding. Regarding future rationing policies, I would like to present my humble opinions as follows:</p>
<p>In order to protect the minimum living standards of the general public, the government must be determined to overcome all difficulties.</p>
<p>Secondly, it should thoroughly cooperate with the Allied institutions related to rationing, find ways to enrich the source of materials, and at the same time discuss transportation issues, purchase price issues, etc., and jointly take responsibility for material rationing in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Find ways to plan the exchange of materials between the north and south of the country, and adopt a mutually beneficial approach.</p>
<p>Thoroughly investigate hoarding on a large scale. If materials related to rationing are found, they should be confiscated and handed over to the rationing office to be sold to citizens at a fair price.</p>
<p>Substitute materials should be rationed. For example, for the current household rice rationing, before it is rationed, the rationing of coarse grains should be increased as much as possible. Or, the current special flour rationing for various industries should be increased for general users, which is also an appropriate measure.</p>
<p>(The End)</p>
<h3>Suggestions for Improving Well Digging</h3>
<p>— Wang Peiting</p>
<p>Since the city's tap water has been repeatedly reduced in quantity, citizens have deeply felt the pain of insufficient water. Therefore, various neighborhoods have opened up earth wells to seek remedy. However, most of these earth wells have been poorly dug, resulting in poor water quality, making them unsuitable for consumption and only suitable for washing.</p>
<p>More importantly, these earth wells pose a great danger to residents. Most of these well-digging projects are contracted out and built with shoddy workmanship and materials, especially the well walls. The surface seems to be quite solid, but in reality, it is only made of bricks and earth, with a very thin layer of lime. Once submerged in water, it will collapse, and various dangers will arise. Minor incidents include cats and dogs falling into the well, drowning and rotting. If this is not noticed, consumption may be harmful to hygiene. In the dark of night and during curfew, pedestrians may accidentally lose their footing and fall into the well. This is especially dangerous for children. In the event of an air raid or fire, residents will rush to escape. If the alleys are narrow and people rush in like a tide, falling into the well and drowning is also possible.</p>
<p>To avoid the above-mentioned possible unfortunate events, the best way is to remove the well curb and pave the surface with cement, with small holes around it to allow air to circulate. Open a hole in the middle, large at the top and small at the bottom (to prevent children from falling down). The size should be suitable for a long, round lead bucket to draw water, and it should be equipped with a bottle-stopper-style stone cover, which should be tightly closed when not in use. If economically feasible, it is best to install a water pump. The pump can be placed near a clean wall with water. In this way, the trouble of drawing water with a bucket can be avoided, and it does not hinder traffic. It is truly beneficial in every way. It is hoped that citizens will pay attention to the above points when digging new wells. It is truly a great service to the public. (Contribution for Academic Aid)</p>
<h3>Opening Parks</h3>
<p>— Jue Ya</p>
<p>In this densely populated city, the only places to get some fresh air are a few public parks. Shanghai is densely populated, and the original parks were not enough to meet the needs. Recently, there has been a sudden change, that is, several parks have been closed, and citizens cannot enter.</p>
<p>It is certain that the parks are not open for other uses, but they are not used all day long, from morning to night. Part of the time should still be free.</p>
<p>Therefore, I propose that the opening hours of the parks be shortened; reopening them based on the principle of not hindering other uses. The parks should be fully utilized, and the citizens should have a place to roam. I wonder if the authorities will adopt this suggestion.</p>
<h3>The Necessity of Vehicles Burning Lights at Night</h3>
<p>— Gu Qizhong</p>
<p>Recently, rickshaws, bicycles, etc. on the road often cause accidents due to the lack of lights at night, day after day, especially bicycles. What is even stranger is that a few public officials ride bicycles without lights, rushing around, as if the authorities have no such regulations. In addition, rickshaws do not burn lights at night, and law enforcement officials turn a blind eye, which is puzzling. At this time of vigorously renewing municipal administration, it is a matter of public safety, and I hope the authorities will pay attention to it.</p>
<h3>Preparing for War Against the United States</h3>
<p>Since the enemy's Pacific operations controlled Iwo Jima, their air bases have been advanced by one thousand kilometers from the Marianas. As we previously pointed out, once Manila is in their hands, the bay can be transformed into a major forward supply base. The former commander of the enemy's Asian fleet, Yarnell, contributed an article to the "Red Fleet" newspaper, openly stating this strategic intention. At the same time, he boasted about and praised the efforts of his country's navy, which traveled five thousand miles across the Pacific to finally achieve today's strategic situation. He emphasized naval primacy and concluded by saying that the main task of future landing operations against Japan also rests on the navy's shoulders.</p>
<p>Enemy Strategy</p>
<p>In that article, he said that his country's troops have entered Manila, and if the Cavite naval base is restored, even if it cannot serve as an anchorage for the entire Pacific fleet, it can at least be used as a base for supply ships, so the value of Manila Bay is extremely high. Utilizing this forward supply base, and coordinating with the navy's crucial mobile units to advance directly forward, a landing on the Japanese mainland is by no means impossible. He implied that instead of implementing MacArthur's landing operation on the Asian continent, they would launch Nimitz's direct attack on Japan, highly praising the effectiveness of the navy and advocating naval primacy. We can only approve such discussions. Even when landing on Iwo Jima, which is less than four and a half miles in circumference, they mobilized the entire Pacific fleet and paid a huge price. When they landed in northern France, simply crossing the English Channel, which only takes three hours, required the protection and assistance of the entire British navy and more than two years of thorough preparation. Just thinking about these things makes it clear.</p>
<p>Ready and Waiting</p>
<p>Even if Manila Port is opened as a supply base, as Yarnell said, it will be highly effective, and the fact that its Pacific base can be advanced three to five thousand miles from Hawaii is also a fact. Assuming that the reorganized and successful 50th Mobile Unit is as impressive as they boast, according to a statement regarding the Iwo Jima operation, the initial supply for one American soldier is sixteen tons for the first month and six tons for the second month. If averaged at eight tons, assuming they want to send 200,000 landing troops, 1.6 million tons of supplies will be required. Moreover, this supply convoy, traveling a long distance of 2,300 kilometers from Manila to the Japanese mainland, must meander in a long snake-like line of ships, connecting with the mobile unit that they rely on as their main combat force, inevitably exposing its massive body within the bombing range of Japanese base air forces. Are the strong Japanese soldiers and brave generals waiting in readiness doing nothing in vain? For them, the greatest danger lies in this.</p>
<p>Seize the Opportunity</p>
<p>Yarnell can now be said to be an admiral who has not personally shouldered the burden of command, but from the movements of the enemy's mobile units, not to mention the current state of the Pacific war, there is no doubt that Nimitz intends to covet the Japanese mainland. Yarnell can be said to be his representative spokesman. Since the enemy's operational intentions are so clear, we must immediately be on guard. What should be prepared? Needless to say, it is the large-scale production and accumulation of aviation weapons. Moreover, with the divine strategy of our leadership, a suitable opportunity will arrive for a major explosion. Defeating the enemy's divine machine will not come by waiting. Whether the future opportunity can truly become a divine opportunity depends on the efforts of our entire nation. Only through bloody and sweaty, desperate efforts can we seize the opportunity. Should we not all rise up together now? (Translated from the March 9th Yomiuri Hochi)</p>

<h3>A Lan</h3>
<p>— Hong Ying</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>Grayish-white light, secretly stretched its footsteps in the cold air; in just a fraction of a second, it created an amazing process. Over the buildings, over the window sills of the buildings, the tables and chairs, and the floor. Finally, when the sky, with its few morning stars, changed from black to a fish-belly color, it filled every space, and everything in the building became white, bright!</p>
<p>A Lan yawned at this time; he had just woken up from a dream. In the dream, he had become a writer again, a teacher loved by many children... He was happy, free, and joyful. But A Lan opened his eyes from the joyful mood and quickly turned over again, closing his eyes tightly, wanting to return to the dream. Because he saw what he hated and felt most annoyed by: the yellowish-pink walls, the lavish sofa, the desk and telephone in the distance, all stimulating his recently relaxed nerves. So A Lan's mood gradually rose like a mercury column, and his young heart was beating, beating, beating....</p>
<p>"Get up, you bastard!" Reason challenged A Lan, and one figure after another emerged from the blankets, rushing back and forth on the floor with rapid steps. A Lan had no choice but to flip out of the bunk, grab a towel, a washbasin, a toothbrush, and toothpaste, and begin his morning routine.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>A Lan walked down the stairs quickly, scribbled a few strokes on the sign-in book lying on the table in the living room, and then ran into the office. Here, the first meeting of each day did not require a polite nod or a more courteous "Good morning!" They merely glanced around with familiar eyes, and then sat down listlessly in armchairs to rest for a while, before taking out ledgers, pens, and abacuses... A busy and lively atmosphere filled the entire room.</p>
<p>A Lan used his key to open the safe, opened the drawer, and took out piles of documents and copies. A tea boy delivered a cup of hot tea, and he took a sip to moisten his dry lips. "Ah!" A Lan felt a headache and a stuffy feeling when he saw these things and this environment, but he had to start writing.</p>
<p>The crowds outside poured into the bank like a tide, and colleagues were busy responding with smiling faces—especially in the cashier's section, stacks of red and green bills were thrown out of the counter, and then stacks of red and green were moved in from people's hands. A Lan hated these, hated money, and hated the pitiful and foolish fellows acting out comedies and tragedies.</p>
<p>"Okay, okay, okay... Hehehe, it doesn't matter, that's the count. Five million, five million... It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter..." A fat director, raised his golden voice, laughing and shouting into the telephone receiver. In A Lan's view, this outward kindness was a substitute for internal malice and scheming. "Hypocrite, damn it, philistine, dog! Should go to hell ten thousand times." A Lan cursed fiercely, and looked at his happy face, hypocritical face, and numb face with disdain.</p>
<p>Over there, A Lan quietly noticed that a general affairs officer had become short-tempered and was getting angry, scolding people. "Hey, tea boy! What's the matter? Can't you even wipe the cups clean? Isn't the Argen cigarette here yet?..."</p>
<p>Over there, A Lan's gaze shifted, and the general affairs officer walked over to the manager's side, the anger on his face immediately disappearing, replaced by boundless smiles, endless attentiveness, and immeasurable kindness. "Mr. Zhu, it will be done exactly like this, please rest assured. I will send someone over first thing tomorrow morning... Yes, send someone over."</p>
<p>Further over there, A Lan's eyes jumped to the body of an old clerk. According to A Lan, this old document clerk, whose head was full of white hair and who was over fifty years old, had been eating this for job since he was young. However, a document clerk is just a document clerk. Now, he is slow to work, and his thoughts are also exhausted. Look at him! Lighting one cheap cigarette after another, tearing up one draft after another, coughing, spitting, and gasping....</p>
<p>A Lan's emotions completely followed the speculation of each person's different changes. Gradually, his heart could not be peaceful. On the surface, he bent over, moved his pen, and completely focused his energy on his work; in reality, A Lan's mind was full of countless scenes, and his thoughts were spinning, spinning.... He wondered: What is a person? What is the human world?</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>At exactly twelve o'clock, the bell upstairs rang, and everyone in the office realized that it was lunchtime. They quickly put down their work, left their seats, and walked upstairs at a running pace. So the stairs were full of feet. A Lan also sat at the dining table with them. Here, the emotions of every soul seemed extremely tense; one hand held a rice bowl, and the other pinched chopsticks; the young ones picked up a piece of fatty meat, and then snatched a chopstick of fresh fish. The old ones also took two chopsticks of scrambled eggs and one chopstick of shredded meat. Everyone exerted themselves, exerted their wildness, and desperately swallowed the rice grains into their mouths. Occasionally, some took a breath in the tense air, showing some disgust, but in this way, they filled their stomachs with food, and every soul felt satisfied, satisfied with their meal.</p>
<p>Within ten minutes, each food bowl became empty, each seat became empty, and A Lan was the only one left at the table. Immediately, an indescribable feeling filled his mind. A Lan could not figure out what this phenomenon was. "Hmm, this is the harm of hunger and thirst," A Lan thought of the words in the ancient books, "the harm of hunger and thirst is enough to harm the heart. Yes, people do this for the drive of the will to live, for having to accept the challenge of life, but...?"</p>
<p>A Lan returned to the armchair in a daze, and the tea boy delivered another cup of hot tea, which he drank in one gulp. Taking advantage of some free time, he lowered his head towards a square piece of glass on the desk and pondered endlessly. As soon as the surrounding things touched his eyes, he tried his best to think about why they were doing this. Look, there are several older colleagues, all bent over, with white hair and wrinkles, now smoking and chatting leisurely. Their faces are so peaceful and serene. And those young people, although six or seven out of thirty have a few strands of white hair growing in their black hair, they don't have any worries or haggardness, but show themselves to be very proud and comfortable. As for himself, his soul is disturbed and in pain every day, without a moment of peace, why is this? What exactly is it for?</p>
<p>The more A Lan squeezed his brain to think, the more his depression surged like a tide. "Hmph, are foolish people digging graves for themselves? Are they destroying their own future?" What is the meaning of life, what is the purpose of work? He saw reality, saw the changes in reality, and suddenly felt lost. "They..." A Lan couldn't find a suitable reason to explain these people, so he felt even more lost.</p>
<p>"No," A Lan's soul cried out, "they are indeed digging their own graves, but can you, A Lan, also be so confused? Don't you have a beautiful dream, a beautiful life? This environment, this ugliness, only serves as a kind of experience, a kind of display for your life; although it also gives you a kind of suffering, and people should endure suffering."</p>
<p>"A Lan," the soul cried out even louder, "face this kind of life squarely!"</p>
<p>IV</p>
<p>One day's work passed, and each soul revealed their pleasant emotions, tidied up their bodies, and calmly left the office, gradually dispersing, dispersing, and disappearing their shadows on the way home.</p>
<p>V</p>
<p>Dusk added layers upon layers, and the dormitory turned pitch black. A Lan turned on the electric light, opened a copy of "Nietzsche's Autobiography" under the dim light, and looked at it, thinking; the muscles of his whole body were constantly tense, relaxed; relaxed, tense....</p>
<p>——People should express their true strength, not be contaminated by the inferior, short-sighted, and selfless.</p>
<p>——Children growing up in humid air do not necessarily have to be pessimistic about fate. We have no other way but to become reformers—we must never let go of the situation where things retain hypocrites.</p>
<p>A Lan's heart was set free; he forgot the environment, forgot all impressions, like a little rabbit growing up in the grassland, with curiosity, excitement, and reverence, running to the forest with fairy music. He understood the great philosopher's words, understood what is self, what is fate, what is resistance!</p>
<p>VI</p>
<p>It was late at night, and one figure after another sneaked back from outside, and the dormitory was immediately filled with a strong smell of alcohol, cigarettes, and unrestrained laughter.</p>
<p>—Old Liu, the wine we drank today was good, really good chicken.</p>
<p>—Old Liu, hey, don't pretend to be deaf, how is the stock market today, up or down? Grabbed a hat (suspiciously) and made a profit? No wonder!</p>
<p>—Old Liu has good luck, Xiao Li, we want him to treat us...</p>
<p>—Of course I'll treat you, tomorrow, let's go to the Cosmopolitan, Nana is waiting for you there! Can't have a good time.</p>
<p>—Oh, still pretending to be dumb, if you have money, why not be extravagant? Definitely going...</p>
<p>—What, no suit? I'll lend you one; are your leather shoes old? Buy a pair...</p>
<p>A Lan couldn't stand these nonsense words, he flicked his two clear eyeballs and pondered in a daze. His few short beards symbolized his tenacity, stubbornness, and arrogance. Slowly, the surrounding despicable phenomena stimulated his flames to rise. So, his two pupils were filled with bright flowing light, as if they were tears, no, it was the light of his mature feelings that was sublimating.</p>
<p>He thought:—</p>
<p>Didn't God give every human being a soul? Can't pure souls accept those despicable and inferior scenes? And because of the perception of the soul, people have to resist those malicious and shameless things? Now, why do people live in this circle covered by the abyss of sin without being aware of it, but instead laugh and live very naturally? Then, what about their souls? Who snatched their souls away, who subjected them to severe torture and shackles so that they could not speak?....</p>
<p>A Lan then inferred from reality: those old employees, when they were young, also had a lively and brave soul, facing reality squarely and fighting. However, slowly, slowly, external stimuli, obstacles, and suffering, constantly increased. Or, for the greed and desire for official positions, their souls lost their central position; they evaded responsibility, evaded justice. Finally, the soul was ethereal in their bodies, and one by one they died. They only had a body and numb nerves left. Occasionally, they would come back to life, but it was only a slight disturbance, a groan, and they could never cheer up. From then on, they accepted sin, accepted heresy; they regarded hell as heaven and gold as life, walking towards the grave of death under the urging of the years....</p>
<p>A person ends his life so easily!</p>
<p>VII</p>
<p>A Lan thought so much that he was tired. He lay down on the bunk.</p>
<p>The noisy sound in the dormitory was slightly quieter, and a decadent melody floated in again.</p>
<p>—You are my soul... chirp chirp chirp... you are my life...</p>
<p>—Alas alas (the sighing sound mixed with the singing), no, no, no, hahaha (the sound became happy again), you are my life... chirp... you are my soul!</p>
<p>"Life! Soul?" A Lan was so stimulated by the boring singing that he couldn't sleep. When he opened his two eyes to observe the surroundings, it seemed that the pinkish-yellow walls were covered with sharp-headed nails, and the chairs were full of sharp knives; his bunk was a net woven with gold threads. Those who were talking and laughing were terrible skeletons. A Lan thought: he had fallen into this trap that could destroy life. And he saw groups of people who would die in this net. So, A Lan's soul was in turmoil, he judged himself, knowing that his soul was being tormented and in pain in the flames of fire... At the same time, he saw his ideal life, a writer, a teacher loved by countless children.... Therefore, his heart beat even more fiercely, like a ignorant little deer running wildly in the forest, he became excited, and angry, his head like a powder magazine about to explode.</p>
<p>"Hmph, you!" A Lan sat upright on the bunk, loudly—his two eyes were even bluer, brighter, and more spirited—"You dead souls! Dead souls! Find it back."</p>
<p>Everyone stopped and looked at A Lan's words in surprise. But no one could understand the meaning of the words: they only thought that A Lan was being stupid or crazy today.</p>
<p>Outside, the black of night was deeper and heavier.</p>
<p>The mood of "...this person alone is haggard" floated to his heart, and A Lan's soul felt lonely and lonely; although there was still a bit of superhuman arrogance.</p>
<h3>Zhou Xuan's Concert</h3>
<p>— Tie Ying</p>
<p>As a prelude to the Spring Festival, Zhou Xuan used several pure songs to thank her fans and moviegoers. The door of the Jin Du presented the grand occasion of a festival. The program was divided into three parts, including ten famous songs, all of which were the most popular theme songs or interludes from the films Zhou Xuan starred in, and also famous songs from the victory and EMI's best-selling records.</p>
<p>The yellow silk curtain was drawn open, revealing the inner layer of purple-red silk curtain. In front of the orchestra platform, the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra performed, conducted jointly by Jin Yu Gu and Li Jinguang. The beautiful scenery blended poetic and artistic feelings, and it could also be used to match the meaning of each song, helping to complete the effect of the performance. One pure and bright lyric after another, lined with the beautiful artistic conception of the background, made people think of them as lyrical new poems—the audience was not only able to feast their ears, but also feast their eyes.</p>
<p>Green grass and fields, tender willow branches, white clouds in the blue sky, transforming beautiful colored areas... The singer was softly singing the theme song of Fisherwoman. The impression given to people is: quiet, clear, simple.</p>
<p>During the interval between the second part of the singing and the change of scenery, Yan Hou and Guan Pang Shi's comedic and unique dialogue, as well as the compilation of the song titles sung by Zhou Xuan into a story, interspersed with many jokes.</p>
<p>After the second act of singing was over and the curtain was lowered again, Mr. Qin Jingzhang was invited to perform a solo on the national instrument pipa—Huaiyin Pingchu. His fingering was skillful, and the strings plucked made the sound of gold, stone, pearls and jade, which was quite wonderful.</p>
<p>After Miss Zhou Xuan sang six pleasant and moving songs, including Fisherwoman and Phoenixes Flying Together, the third part—Phoenixes Sing in Harmony—was about to begin! The stage was decorated with clusters of flowers, rich and grand. Miss Zhou sang along with the piano, softly singing in harmony. The feature here is: there is gentleness, there is softness, there is sweetness, and there is clarity, and the singing is extremely pleasant to the ear. She can use emotion to control the singing, and she can also use the singing to express meaning and convey inner emotions. It makes people never tire of listening and lingering. Miss Zhou has her own special cultivation and talent in the art and understanding of singing!</p>
<h3>Crying</h3>
<p>— Stie</p>
<p>—On the Birth of a Child—</p>
<p>Elegy of birth!</p>
<p>Mixed with shock, doubt, fear,</p>
<p>Make the first sound into the world.</p>
<p>…………</p>
<p>Light—dazzling,</p>
<p>Skin—tingling,</p>
<p>Air is a cold snake,</p>
<p>The bellows only fan stiffly.</p>
<p>…………</p>
<p>Starting from this cry,</p>
<p>Hunger, thirst, defecation, urination, worries, sorrows;</p>
<p>Every square centimeter of a thousand kilograms</p>
<p>And all eternal debts.</p>
<p>…………</p>
<p>Starting from this cry,</p>
<p>Birth, old age, sickness, death, injury, pain,</p>
<p>Welcome the line of light with a black shadow</p>
<p>You are a whole in the universe.</p>
<p>…………</p>
<p>Stepping into the gate of the world naked,</p>
<p>The thin chest beats with a hot heart;</p>
<p>The surrounding air is too cold,</p>
<p>Therefore, you must be wrapped in soft cotton wool.</p>
<p>…………</p>
<p>Limbs and body are beyond your control,</p>
<p>Come out of the warm black house,</p>
<p>You took the wrong way, this is a bright prison,</p>
<p>And cry out your first heartbreak!</p>
<h3>Ode to the Mist</h3>
<p>— Xia Ru</p>
<p>The ground is veiled in clouds and mist, a gentle, moist breath hovering over rooftops, treetops, and the faces of passersby. It's like a pair of white, soft hands playfully obscuring your eyes, yet you can only respond with a tender rebuke; how could you bear resentment or anger? It is the gentleness of a passionate lover, caressing you and whispering sweet nothings into your heart.</p>
<p>Have you ever lingered on a misty riverbank or in a valley? It seems like a still, milky white veil, but within it lies a writhing, dancing soul.</p>
<p>"It is the sigh of the god Zeus, who, waking one night, sees the bustling of humankind and exhales a breath," a friend told me. I shook my head. But seeing the pervasive, self-draping curtain, drifting slowly through the dawn-lit world, so light and carefree, I cannot believe it is the troubled sigh of a great god.</p>
<p>The wind in the mist is a joyful wind, carrying a damp fragrance, floating to you from its wandering and then hurrying away in gusts. It licks your hair, leaving a dewy kiss on your forehead, and your still-drowsy eyes open, brightened. Facing the hazy expanse, you take a deep breath, straighten your chest, unafraid of the bloody reality that will emerge after the mist dissipates.</p>
<p>I love the misty dawn. It is not only as tender as a lover's hand, but also as loving as a mother's eyes, weaving together hope, with boundless kindness and resolve. Hope for a more glorious sunrise, a clearer blue sky. After the mist, there is often a cloudless azure. That is why I love it even more!</p>
<p>In the thick fog, we crawl along, timid and slow. Hesitating before the distant telephone poles, fearing the sounds of carriages and horses behind us. It is then that we understand the true meaning of "thinking" and "courage": considering the chaotic environment around you, choosing the safest path, summoning the determination to move forward, bravely progressing through the mist. It is the mist that teaches me how to think and be brave—about life.</p>
<p>The music of Northern Europe is desolate and heavy, and in misty regions, the songs of young women are filled with infinite lament, singing ancient lyrical poems, old legends from the times of grandmothers and mothers, with sorrow and love. The trembling sounds can pierce your sensitive heart. You want to sing along: "Love is like mist, coming and going without a trace..." A mist song, like weeping, like pleading.</p>
<p>I praise the mist, but cannot indulge in the daylight after the mist, like a dreamer who trembles in fear of the reality after the dream ends. In the mist, ugliness is temporarily concealed; in dreams, life is always beautiful. I am somewhat afraid to see everything under the sunlight.</p>
<p>Is this decadence? That I can long for the beauty of the mist, but cannot smile at the boundless light after the mist disappears?</p>

<h3>International Cup, Italy vs. China, Quarterfinals This Morning: Hopes Placed on the Chinese Team</h3>
<p>— Bi Xian</p>
<p>Today, Sunday (the 8th), at 10:00 AM, the International Cup quarterfinals will be held at Jiaozhou Park, with China playing Italy. Although it's only the quarterfinals, it's practically the final. Considering the strength of the other possible finalist, Northern Europe, it's probably weaker than these two teams. So the winner of this match should secure the championship.</p>
<p>Seven teams joined this competition for international glory. Russia, the Jewish team, and Japan were all eliminated in the preliminary rounds. Portugal was defeated by Northern Europe in the quarterfinals.</p>
<p>Tournament Bracket</p>
<p>Our Chinese team had a bye in the preliminary rounds. Today's quarterfinal is their first appearance. They immediately face a tough opponent. The key to success or failure lies in this one match, highlighting its importance. Looking at the selected team members, apart from Jia Youliang, Han Longhai, Li Yao, Wu Qixiang, etc., who were excluded, they have practically searched all of Shanghai's first-class players. However, I still believe that gathering the essence of each team without sufficient prior practice risks the criticism of being a "star system." The outcome is a separate matter. Seamless cooperation is unlikely to be achieved. I have repeatedly written about this, but my words have been in vain. However, the situation is pressing, and we must act. The most pressing issue is how to arrange the formation. According to what the authorities have announced:</p>
<p>Liu Xianhan</p>
<p>Li Ning Zhang Linggen</p>
<p>Song Lingsheng Fu Zhen Meng Yiliang</p>
<p>Zhou Qilin Sun Jinshun Dai Linjing Li Yichen Xu Wenkui</p>
<h3>Overview of the Italian Team's Strength</h3>
<p>(Reserves) Zhang Banglun, Huang Shijie, Li Tiansheng, Gao Baozheng, Luo Shoufu, Lei Shu, Yu Liming.</p>
<p>With the above lineup announced, we may as well examine the Italian team's strategy and strengths and weaknesses to assess whether our lineup is appropriate. The so-called Italian team will likely be composed entirely of players from the overseas Chinese community. The famous goalkeeper, Ke, will also be assisting. Although the team's goalkeeper belongs to the upper echelon, the strength gained is still limited, but the team's momentum will undoubtedly become more magnificent because of this. The defenders Sirati, Luo Xulai, the center backs Ottonilo, Xue Weitai, and Bolini are unlikely to be changed. The forwards are likely to be: with Yatuomali sick, the center forward will be Teikeni, right forward Bama, left winger Di Panbang, right winger Vila, and left forward Baojie. With the lineup clear, let's talk about their strategy. In defense, the forwards and backs always form a straight line, with little skill in cooperation. They rely on their strength to follow the opposing players. Center back Ottonilo seems to be focused on defense, but in reality, his strong legs allow him to do as he pleases, either assisting the wings or cleverly passing through the middle. Therefore, Ottonilo is the most satisfactory center back in assisting the attack. Moreover, his passes are without hesitation, making it easy to catch the opponent off guard. As for the attack, the wingers have the ability to cross to each other, but lack the skill to dribble deep and break through the center. The two inside forwards can return to defense and dribble the ball, but the positions of the two inside forwards are too chaotic, resulting in no fixed style. Furthermore, the players' shots lack precision, so it's hard to get the best reviews from all circles.</p>
<h3>Li Ning Should Be Replaced by Tiansheng</h3>
<p>It can be seen whether our Chinese team's lineup is reasonable and if it's a targeted strategy. I think the biggest mistake is the left back Li Ning, and the left forward is Song Lingsheng. I've often seen Li and Song representing the Chinese Association, occupying these two positions, and each time they seem to be working independently, frequently making mistakes. And this time, the Italian attack will be more on the right than on the left, so heavily relying on Li and Song is tantamount to giving them an opportunity. Isn't this making a big mistake? I think Li Ning should be replaced by Li Tiansheng. Both are veterans with old qualifications and rich experience. But in terms of leg strength and energy, the latter is superior to the former. Some will say that Li Ning's position is excellent, which I don't deny. But observe Li Ning's weak leg and the fact that nineteen out of ten balls he kicks are out of bounds, with no better landing point. Moreover, cooperation between Li Tiansheng and Song Lingsheng is expected, and the past unsuccessful phenomenon of Li Ning and Song Lingsheng working independently will definitely not be repeated. If some think that Li Ning's mind is clearer than Tiansheng's and insist on reusing him, then I think Tan Fuzhen should switch positions with Song Lingsheng. For the sake of team cooperation, this is a necessary transformation on the defensive end.</p>
<h3>It's Better Not to Have A Dai Kick</h3>
<p>Let's talk about the forward line. After looking at the list, almost everyone thinks they are all well-known generals, but I feel that this forward line can be called old-fashioned. The most needed for forwards are two inside forwards with the strength to return to the defense and dribble the ball. Sun Jinshun is okay, but Li Yichen may not be able to do it, which will make Meng Yiliang feel unsupported. This is not a good strategy. And in fact, the way to attack Italy, in addition to the leg, is to rely on a forward who can dart around, otherwise, it will be difficult to break through the enemy's goal. The five listed forwards are all veterans, but there is no darting energy. Dai Linjing's center forward position does indeed impress, supplying Longhai with balls for a darting attack, and passing to Youliang and Li Yao in the most tacit position. However, since Jia, Li, and Han can't play, I say A Dai will bury his talent. So A Dai should step down, and Li Yichen should take the center position, and another person, Gao Baozheng, should be used as an inside forward as a reasonable attempt to defeat the enemy. Although Xu Wenkui has skillful ball skills, he is ultimately unable to keep up physically. I hope he will know his limitations and switch Yu Liming onto the field. However, if Yu goes on the field, I hope he will make more breakthroughs, and avoid pointlessly trying to pull the goal, as Yu's kick has no purpose.</p>
<p>The above is the reporter's suggestion that the Chinese team's lineup needs to be changed. I wonder if it can invite the sympathy of the authorities?</p>
<p>Finally, I sincerely hope that the soldiers who are about to go into battle will cooperate sincerely at the time, work together, not hold personal opinions, and fight bravely to the end to achieve the wish to defeat the Italian generals and win glory for the country. All fans are looking forward to it. Cheer up! Athletes! (Le)</p>
<h3>Post-Match Commentary on the North China-Hua Lian Championship</h3>
<p>The authorities were afraid that there would be too many spectators in the final battle of the North China-Hua Lian Basketball League 甲甲group, causing disputes, and that simply increasing ticket prices would lose the original intention of promotion. Therefore, they would rather hold it secretly at the Youth Association Gymnasium in Baxianqiao at 10 am last weekend (April 1st). This is a win-win and a helpless strategy. As a result, North China won a great victory, and the 甲甲group was able to come to a satisfactory end, and the authorities got rid of a concern. But the fans heard about it, and they will definitely complain that the authorities are unreasonable, and there is no opportunity to admire it! So the reporter went with the referee of the game, Jin Botao, in the morning and didn't miss it. Here is a post-match review of this final game to help the fans quench their thirst.</p>
<p>North China Wins the Championship</p>
<p>At the beginning of the game, Hua Lian was skilled in basketball, taking the lead. North China did not show weakness, so the scores were always very close, with a constant difference of two or three points. And the first half was over. North China led by twenty-one to eighteen. In the second half, Hua Lian had the heart to revive and still tried to recover. The offensive was very good, chasing closely. North China did not relax at all, and the battle was very exciting and tense. But Hua Lian unfortunately lagged behind at twenty-two to twenty-seven. Because of Xu Jusheng's four fouls, there were no substitutes, and they were unable to make a comeback, and North China trampled on them at will. Hua Lian was defeated, and North China won the 甲甲group championship.</p>
<p>Review of the Advantages of the Two Teams</p>
<p>Comparing this final game, there is really no ideal basketball skill to admire. Because Hua Lian has Qu Xilin, Fan Qinggong, Zhang Xianlun, and Quan Changchun, the four knights who went north and have not returned, and North China also has Shen Yugong who has a foot injury that has not healed, and Tan Yongzhan has already gone elsewhere, and is busy acting in Paris. Therefore, both sides see that domination is easy, but it is extremely difficult to adjust. Under these circumstances, it depends on each other's caution and reducing fouls is the prerequisite. North China was able to pay attention to this point, being careful, and there were few fouls. On the other hand, Hua Lian was punished in the first half by Bott. In the second half, Xu Jusheng was again graduated four times. This is the only reason why Hua Lian failed, with a difference of nineteen points.</p>
<p>Hua Lian has three points that are satisfying. First, the accuracy of the shot is breathtaking. Xu Jusheng, Zhang Liangxiong, and Kong Guangyi can be called shots from anywhere. The second is the extensive use of individual skills, so they can have the opportunity to shoot from a distance. The third is that even in the face of North China's fear, they tried their best to follow up under the basket, not afraid of North China, which is worthy of praise. What is disappointing is the degeneration of Wu Chengzhang, who accomplished nothing, and the failure to pay attention to fouls, which led to no one to replace him, which is a pity for the defeat.</p>
<p>The success of North China lies in the defense and offense. Its use of man-to-man marking has become pure. This is the first point. It is desirable to use height, passing over the top, and standing under the basket to follow up and support people, killing the enemy. Although the method of blocking people is rarely used when attacking, it has the heart to lure the enemy in the unnecessary passing, and Zhuo Guorong has repeatedly gained gaps, all of which are good gains.</p>
<p>The basketball season has passed, and the wonderful games in Shanghai will disappear with the 北大北決戰告北. I heard that the North China Brave Tianjin Basketball Team has come to Shanghai. The Shanghai Children's Library plans to raise funds to invite North China and 克克仁余 to make four anti-matches. If so, then as the autumn wave is approaching, basketball can still have a grand event, and we will wait and see. (Dao)</p>
<h3>Snow White Women's Basketball Team</h3>
<p>Back row: Shi Meifeng, Zhu Jiazhen, Guo Aizhen, Zhang Xiuguo, Hou Yeli, Nie Baozhu, Zhang Juefei (instructor)</p>
<p>Front row: Wang Huiling, Sheng Jing, Bai Yune, Xiao Ying, Chen Wenqin, Huang Ruyu (captain)</p>
<h3>Han Longhai Arrived in Shanghai the Night Before</h3>
<p>Due to the fact that Donghua and Overseas Chinese United lost by one goal in the rematch, fans are missing this young white-robed general Han Longhai. He has the fastest darting momentum, he has the kung fu to pounce one step faster than the ape McNitti, so he got the elegant name of "McNitti Kui Xing", and in fact, he is indeed the forward that McNitti is most afraid of.</p>
<p>A month ago, General Han went to Bengbu for official business, and he was supposed to stay there for one or two months, but why did he suddenly return? It is said that it was because of the urgent telegram from Cheng Bo'an, the owner of Fuhua, because there will be a grand football game in Shanghai recently, and he specially invited Longhai to rush back to participate in the war. The reporter met Mr. Han yesterday. According to him, he arrived in Shanghai the night before (the 6th). It is expected that when this grand football match is staged, with the assistance of General Han, the fans who miss him will flock to watch it. Really, maybe he will kick this ball and leave Shanghai. We will wait and see when the game comes soon. (Jiujing)</p>
<h3>The Racecourse Stadium is Still Leased for Matches</h3>
<p>The Football Federation is indeed racking its brains on the stadium issue. It often feels insufficient, which affects the progress of the game a lot. A few days ago, Yiyuan Greyhound Racecourse was ordered by the authorities to dissolve within a time limit, and the stadium was also subject to the example of being closed. When the bad news came, it was tantamount to a serious blow to the Football Federation. (According to the Football Federation, Yiyuan Stadium is the most suitable for all important football matches.) Recently, there has also been talk about stopping the lease of the racecourse, so the panic of the stadium has become more serious, and Jiaozhou Park is the only one left that can publicly sell tickets.</p>
<p>Although the football league and various cup games have come to an end, the remaining games are attractive and require a large venue. Jiaoyuan has a small capacity and it is difficult to maintain order. The Football Federation has consulted several times, but it is difficult to get a satisfactory result. According to reliable sources yesterday, the racecourse stadium is still allowed to be open, and the lease will continue to be used for football matches. The Football Federation was overjoyed after hearing the news. The current stadium problem is expected to be solved, which is also good news for fans. (Muzi)</p>
<h3>Sports News</h3>
<p>Zeng Rongzhong, the former national record holder for 200 meters and 400 meters, is a Fujianese from Min. He graduated from National Jinan University. He is now in Saigon, the capital of Thailand, continuing his father's business, operating rice and wood sales. He said in a letter a few days ago that due to the obstruction of maritime transportation, business is rather bleak. (Leda Guan)</p>
<p>The White Horse Small Football Team was crowned champion in the Fuhua Cup last year. Recently, I heard that the White Horse Football Team has been established. In addition to the original generals Jia Youliang, Dai Linjing, and Zhang Linggen, it also plans to invite famous players to join. Its lineup can be called unmatched. Mr. Cheng Bo'an has already started to proceed. Once it is established, it will confront the strong teams on the sea, which will surely refresh the fans' eyes and ears.</p>
<p>Huang Xingfen of the Green Team has been married since last summer. A few days ago, she was seen to be pregnant.</p>
<p>The first edition of "Sports Figures" edited by Hongchen has been sold out, which shows that its content is excellent. Now I know that the second edition has also been published a few days ago, and it is expected to be popular for a while. Sports people must be the first to see it.</p>
<p>Qian Xucang and Xie Yiqin have been playing ping-pong in the Huangjiasha Dick Ping-Pong Room every day recently. Due to age, basketball is already too much for him, so this is just a painting exercise to relax his muscles and bones. (Yongduan)</p>
<h3>Green Team Yan Wei is About to Get Married</h3>
<p>Miss Yan Weiwen, who has been red since the Qixiu Girls' School basketball team, and has now served as the center of the Si Team women's basketball team. Her ball skills are improving day by day, so this year's performance can be said to be in the most peak state of Miss Yan. We are hoping that she will continue to work hard, have more innovative performances, and improve the level of women's basketball.</p>
<p>Miss Yan's advantages are her standard physique, abundant energy, clear mind, and accurate shots. Miss Yan has made considerable contributions to the Green Team's ability to dominate the Shanghai arena. What is even more valuable is that Miss Yan always smiles during the game, and seems to care about gains and losses. Therefore, she has won the elegant name of "Sweetheart" and gained fame in the sports world.</p>
<p>Now the news has come that Miss Yan's wedding is scheduled, and it has been decided within the next week. As for the exact date, it has not been found out. Although, the reporter has inquired in many ways and has also visited Miss Yan, she is always smiling and perfunctorily saying, "I will invite Mr. to have a wedding banquet on that day," so it is impossible to report. What can be decided is that it will be one day in the next week.</p>
<p>After Miss Yan gets married, she is probably planning to leave Shanghai. Then the Green Team will suffer a loss, and the fans' eyes will be too shallow.</p>
<p>Indeed, I often feel a little inexplicably at a loss when a female player who is progressing suddenly disappears from the stadium after getting married. (Skinny reporter)</p>
<h3>An Explanation of Basketball Theory (15)</h3>
<p>— Liang Zhao'an</p>
<p>How to Snatch Rebounds</p>
<p>The key to snatching rebounds is to avoid being beaten to the front by the opponent when they shoot. Stand between yourself and the basket to block the ball. When the opponent's shot is released, move closer to the basket, stand firmly, and crouch slightly. Observe the ball hitting the backboard and bouncing out, then jump up with all your might. At the highest point, raise both hands to seize the ball, and grip it tightly in your hands, without slapping it. When both feet touch the ground, immediately place the ball in your abdomen for protection, while glancing left and right. If heavily defended, try to escape, either by pivoting or dribbling to the sideline, seeking an open teammate to pass to. If there is no heavy defense after obtaining the ball, seize the opportunity and execute a fast break while the opponent is unprepared, using long passes to teammates near the basket for a layup. Those who can consistently secure rebounds can not only deny the opponent follow-up shot opportunities, but also increase the number of offensive possessions for our team, thereby increasing the chances of victory. Therefore, securing rebounds is the most important skill in defensive strategy.</p>
<p>Defending Against an Opponent Without the Ball</p>
<p>To defend an opponent without the ball, first and foremost, ensure you are always positioned between the opponent and the basket, preventing them from receiving a pass. If, while guarding, the opponent gets ahead and runs faster than you, run backwards, urgently moving towards the basket to secure the inner circle, finding the shortest route, and then intercepting the opponent. While moving, wave your hands to disturb the opponent and make it difficult to pass the ball to them. If, while guarding, the opponent remains stationary, judge their skills and determine your defensive position. If the opponent is good at long-range shots, stand closer to make it difficult for them to shoot. If the opponent is more agile than you, stay further away, moving closer to the inner circle to observe their movements and shorten your defensive route. However, always be mindful of the opponent's attempts to screen, preventing them from using a two-person attack.</p>
<p>Defending Against an Opponent With the Ball</p>
<p>To defend an opponent with the ball, in addition to constantly positioning yourself between the opponent and the basket, you must also consider the situation and decide how to attempt a steal. Do not rush forward to steal unless the opponent has finished dribbling, and do not stand too close. Otherwise, they may seize the opportunity to escape by pivoting or using the dribble to evade. Therefore, at this moment, your position should be within reach of the ball they are holding. Wait for them to be inattentive, then slap the ball out from below and seize it. When slapping the ball, slap from below upwards, not from above downwards. If the opponent has finished dribbling and encounters your defense, you can immediately step forward to steal the ball, or stand closer to make the opponent flustered and lose the ball, or result in a jump ball. However, when approaching the opponent, be careful to prevent them from bounce-passing the ball and escaping after the pass, leaving you lunging in vain and behind the opponent. Therefore, do not forcibly attempt to steal the ball unless you are very confident.</p>
<p>Defending Against Two Opponents with One Defender</p>
<p>Defending against two opponents with one defender is often used during the opponent's fast break. In this situation, the defensive strategy should be to first step forward and feint, causing the opponent dribbling the ball to stop, then quickly retreat to closely guard the opponent near the basket. While retreating, wave your hands to feint, disturb the dribbling opponent, and delay their passing and shooting opportunities, waiting for teammates to catch up and assist, or intercept their pass. This defensive method is extremely strenuous and difficult to execute. Therefore, in this situation, other teammates must provide support to prevent a dangerous situation.</p>
<p>Defending Against an Opponent Dribbling Forward</p>
<p>To defend an opponent dribbling forward, position yourself between the dribbler and the basket. Follow the opponent, and as much as possible, force them towards the sideline or corner of the court, trapping them in a difficult situation, making it difficult to shoot or pass. If you can run alongside the opponent, you can seize an opportunity to steal the ball when they are unprepared. To steal the ball, use the hand closest to the opponent's body, reaching under their dribbling hand to continue the dribble. Slap the ball out, slapping it lower and faster than the opponent. After slapping it out, turn to block the opponent to prevent them from taking it back. When stealing the ball, do not slap down on the opponent's dribbling hand, otherwise, not only will the ball be blocked by the opponent's hand, making it difficult to steal, but you will also easily hit the opponent's hand and commit a foul. If the dribbler comes head-on and tries to pass you, they will quickly dribble the ball low. Therefore, the defender should also bend their knees and lower their body to defend. If they dribble too low and lose control of the ball, you can steal it. If the opponent dribbles forward to shoot, occupy the inner circle and follow them until they jump up to shoot, jumping up at the same time and slapping the ball out as it leaves their hand, preventing them from scoring. When jumping up, face the opponent and avoid contact, using the hand furthest from the opponent to slap the ball. For example, if the opponent shoots at the right corner of the basket, use your left hand to slap the ball; if they shoot at the left corner, use your right hand. If you can time your jump accurately, this interception method is very easy and a foolproof defensive tactic.</p>
<p>Defending Against an Opponent Pivoting</p>
<p>Defending against an opponent pivoting is quite difficult. Therefore, the defender must be alert and agile, able to anticipate the opponent's movements, not be deceived by their feints, and never let their guard down. Especially when the opponent is near the basket or in the free-throw area and wants to pivot, these two locations are critical areas contested by both offense and defense, so strict defense is essential. The methods of strict defense can be described as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Strictly Defending Against an Opponent Pivoting Near the Basket</p>
<p>When an opponent pivots near the basket, their goal is to escape the defender's surveillance in order to seize the opportunity to rush forward and shoot at the corner of the basket. Therefore, the defender should be wary of their feints to turn and escape, and must anticipate their true movement, forcing the opponent as close to the sideline as possible, firmly defending the position between the basket and the opponent. Keep your feet apart and your arms outstretched, making it difficult for them to rush past you. If the opponent moves away, retreats near the sideline or the court, and lures you closer, be wary of their screening tactics, where a second opponent comes to block you. At the same time, alert your teammates to strictly guard the gaps in the free-throw area, preventing the opponent with the ball from escaping. To shoot, or pass the ball to the opponent near the basket for a layup, in this situation, if you cannot steal the opponent's ball, at least force the opponent to pass the ball back to the rear before fulfilling your defensive duty.</p>
<p>(B) Strictly Defending Against an Opponent Pivoting Near the Free Throw Line</p>
<p>When the opponent is standing near the free-throw line in front of the basket, they are likely to receive a pass and then turn and shoot, so strict defense is essential. The defensive method should be to stand beside the opponent, with one hand extended in front of the opponent and one hand placed behind the opponent to make it difficult for them to receive the ball. Once the opponent receives the ball, immediately stand behind them. At this time, do not try to steal the ball, but be prepared for their feints, pivoting left and right to escape, or jumping up to turn and shoot. Your position should change according to the opponent's direction of rotation, and you must pay attention to which hand the ball-handler uses to shoot. If they are good at using their right hand, they will first feint to the right or upwards, and when the defender is deceived and leaves their position, they will pivot to the left to escape and shoot. If they are good at using their left hand, the opposite is true. Therefore, you must anticipate the opponent's true intentions and determine when they start to shoot before blocking. If you can make fierce gestures behind the opponent, using feints to counter feints, you can make the opponent panic and make it difficult for them to shoot, and they will pass the ball back to the rear. If the opponent wants to jump up and turn to shoot, you should jump up at the same time and raise both hands to intercept the ball. But under this strict defense, the opponent may not turn and shoot themselves, but pass the ball to the opponents on either side who are moving forward towards the corner of the basket. Therefore, other teammates should cooperate to defend, so that the opponent has no opportunity to exploit.</p>
<p>1. Key Points of Individual Defense</p>
<p>When your team loses possession of the ball, retreat to defend immediately.</p>
<p>Always occupy the inner circle and defend, standing between the opponent and the basket, so that you can take care of both the ball and the opponent.</p>
<p>When defending, keep your feet apart and your arms outstretched. If the opponent has the ball, raise one hand in front of them to block their shooting or passing lane, and constantly wave your hand to make the opponent panic and disrupt their vision.</p>
<p>Always stand with your heels off the ground, so that you can sprint in any direction at any time.</p>
<p>Except in front of the basket, all defensive stances should be with bent knees and a lowered body, ready to block and steal.</p>
<p>Do not turn around with both feet firmly planted. Lift one foot to turn.</p>
<p>Always stick close to the opponent, stopping and running with them simultaneously.</p>
<p>If the opponent uses "man-to-man" defense and blocking offense, quickly switch defensive positions to counter it.</p>
<p>Run alongside an opponent dribbling forward, and seize the opportunity to slap the ball from under their hand.</p>
<p>Remember that in all defensive strategies, footwork is more important than handwork.</p>

<h3>Several Rising Stars of Football and Basketball</h3>
<p>— Mei Bixian</p>
<p>In the football world, figures like Dai Linjing, Jia Youliang, Sun Jinshun, and Li Yichen have long histories known to a generation of fans. Similarly, in the basketball world, figures like Li Zhenzhong, Shen Yugong, Kong Guangyi, and Qu Xilin, as well as women's basketball players like Rong Shujian, Huang Mingyuan, Li Zhizhi, and Deng Xiuchun are well-known. Of course, while we hope for and encourage these veterans, we should pay even more attention to the younger generation. Given the space often allotted to football and basketball in the newspaper, and considering my own personal circumstances and frail health, which make writing difficult, I have reluctantly chosen this topic to write about the newly famous football and basketball players of recent years, sharing my observations from the field and also hoping to encourage the progress of these younger athletes.</p>
<p>After gathering information, I've come up with a list that roughly includes Han Longhai, Li Yao, and Luo Shoufu in football, Wu Chengzhang, Lin Weicong, and He Jingui in men's basketball, and Yan Weiwen, Xie Lijian, and Zhan Xiuqiong in women's basketball, totaling nine people. I will describe them separately below, starting with women's basketball to show respect for women's rights.</p>
<p>Women's Basketball Heroines</p>
<p>(1) Yan Weiwen</p>
<p>She is the center for the Green Team women's basketball team. Some might say that Miss Yan is also a veteran, as she, along with Zhang Jiapei and Liu Zhenbao, formed the once-famous "Three Musketeers" of Qixiu. However, in reality, Miss Yan was the weakest of the three at that time, with a short and chubby figure and unrefined skills. Now, Miss Yan has a well-proportioned physique and has received careful instruction from Mr. Qian Xucang. Therefore, whether it's holding the ball, dribbling, or shooting, all three are above average. She can be considered the standard center in Shanghai women's basketball and should be listed as a new talent. What's even more commendable is that Miss Yan always smiles during games, earning her the nickname "Sweet Girl." I admire her progress in basketball skills and respect her spirit, so I list her as the first person in this article.</p>
<p>(2) Xie Lijian</p>
<p>She is an excellent forward in the Overseas Chinese team. Miss Xie's specialty is soaring up for a shot, with a graceful posture and precise positioning. It is rare to see such talent among newcomers. Miss Xie is still young and shows significant progress in each game. We can believe that Miss Xie's basketball fame will surely be praised by fans in a short time.</p>
<p>(3) Zhan Xiuqiong</p>
<p>I only became aware of this newcomer's skills during the Shenbao Cup Basketball League. She joined the Yikang team and, thanks to the guidance of the famous Wu Shibin, Miss Zhan has a clear understanding of basketball tactics. We can often see the team using forward Ren Kuanping to screen, and Zhan Xiuqiong quickly darts into the most open space, easily scoring and returning. From this, it can be seen that Miss Zhan has an extremely clear mind and can perform so well under pressure, making her a top-tier talent. Her future is undoubtedly bright.</p>
<p>Men's Basketball Trio</p>
<p>(1) Wu Chengzhang</p>
<p>Of course, he hasn't been playing basketball for a short time, but he has always been stuck in the B-league ranks and has not been noticed. When the Hualian Pharmaceutical Factory basketball team was established, Mr. Wu was appreciated by the team manager, Zhang Huixiang, and was listed as one of the official members. After being polished by the veterans of the team, Mr. Wu's abilities were highlighted. When the Hualian team won the Xiqing championship and repeatedly displayed their prowess in the Chenyou Cup and Shenbao Cup, Mr. Wu also gave outstanding performances. His interception of the ball under the basket is accurate in both position and timing, making it difficult to obtain. Moreover, he has abundant stamina and runs tirelessly throughout the game, which is one of the most important prerequisites for a basketball player. Mr. Wu's teammates call him "Little Brother," which shows that he is in his prime. I encourage "Little Brother" to strive for progress, as his future is limitless.</p>
<p>(2) Lin Weicong</p>
<p>Similar to Wu Chengzhang, he has always been a good player in the B-league ranks. After being favored by Ren Yu Zuo Xunzi, he worked for the Ren Yu team. After being enlightened by Mr. Yu, his skills improved day by day, and the young player was transformed into a famous player, making many contributions to the Ren Yu team. He is now being recruited by the Shantou team and has been entrusted with the important task of captain. Little Lin is truly blessed by heaven. His advantage is that he can shoot from any corner, with both his left and right hands, and he is very confident. He has a lithe body and excellent speed, making him difficult to guard. He is the most standard talent among basketball forwards.</p>
<p>(3) He Jingui</p>
<p>Mr. He's floor skills can be compared to Feng Nianhua at his peak. Although he is short, he has good elasticity, so he does not suffer from being short. He is lifted into the air by another player, and rushes under the basket with a dribble, then shoots. His beautiful posture and swift movements prove his floor skills. He has always been a member of the Huanan team, which is known as the "Little Tyrant" of the basketball world, and Mr. He has made great contributions. In the third Basketball League, the Huanan team was effectively scattered, and Mr. He's skills will be separated from us for a while.</p>
<p>Young White Uniforms (Football)</p>
<p>(1) Han Longhai</p>
<p>Longhai has been working for Donghua for a long time. He used to play the center back position, but in the first league of the Football Federation, Donghua had more center back talents, so Longhai played the right inside forward, displaying great agility, liveliness, and elusiveness. His running speed is aggressive, causing foreigners to lose their color in fear. Donghua's consistent victories last year were greatly related to Longhai's fierce attacks. However, due to the burden of fame, he is easily noticed by the opponent, so he suffers from being closely monitored, leaving Longhai with no chance to use his skills.</p>
<p>(2) Li Yao</p>
<p>The left winger who became famous in one season, and the only left winger in Shanghai, is Li Yao. When Mr. Li was first tried as a left winger for Donghua, people did not dare to place too much hope in him. Unexpectedly, under the guidance of Sun Jinshun, his skills greatly improved, his shooting became sharp, and his courage gradually increased. He is not flustered in the face of strong enemies, and he is full of energy and does not tire in difficult battles. Looking at all the teams in Shanghai, both Chinese and foreign, there is no such good left winger material, so he has been repeatedly selected as a representative of Shanghai and the representative of the Chinese team. Having achieved so much in just one season, is Li Yao truly a natural talent?</p>
<p>(3) Luo Shoufu</p>
<p>After participating in the friendly matches this year, fans have noticed him and looked at each other in appreciation. Little Luo also seems to live up to people's expectations, working hard in battle and giving a good performance in every game, earning unanimous praise from the audience. His playing style is said to be somewhat similar to Li Yingtang, and some say it resembles the famous star V. Suo Ruo. In fact, Little Luo has a wide stride, and his dribbling and shooting skills are excellent. He has both intelligence and hard work and is truly a good material among forwards. I hope Little Luo will not be arrogant or discouraged, but will work harder and reach the peak of achievement. We have high hopes for him.</p>
