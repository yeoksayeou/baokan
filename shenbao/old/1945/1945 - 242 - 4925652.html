<p>顏氏演詞</p>
<p>敞帶表圖係由蔣委員長駐滬代表蔣伯誠將軍所組織，蔣將軍因抱恙未能躬親來營，乃邀鄙人等代表轉達蔣委員長慰問之忱，自太平洋戰爭突然結束後，蔣委員長對於在華集中營之盟僑，深爲關懷亟欲探詢君等之近況（顏氏說明代表團性質後，分別介紹各代表）。繼云：在此時會文字語言不足以表達余等之情意，余等深切明瞭君等在營不幸之遭遇，久失自由，身心交受痛苦，旣與世界隔絕，復與祖國同胞親屬分離，而其中最認爲遺憾者，無疑爲君等在戰時爲祖國效命之機會，被剝奪是也。（盟僑咸答稱：「是」，掌聲雷動。）然君等強毅之犧牲，自亦成為供獻祖國之一大因素，在受禁期間，營中若干盟友有不幸逝世者，余等當對其犧牲精神及永久信賴上帝之信心致敬焉。今者夜魘消逝，光明與希望業已來臨，「遺忘」旣爲自然之消除不快之唯一良法，而余更願予敵人以「寬恕」，若無此精神，地球上具有弱點與惡念之生命，將無以維繫。君等大多僑居此第二故鄉業已多年，常本友愛之心，協助我國與國民。</p>
<p>中國現正跨上復興之途，需要一切可能之協助，以君等之學識及經驗，余深信君等將繼續賜予吾人以有價值之貢獻。君等此後當需要在中國或返祖國休養，但深信君等必將返華幫助吾國之建設工作也。再者吾人深信愛護和平國家所組織之新同盟，對於遏制侵略之永久消滅可怕戰爭之努力，業巳成功，希望二千年前所宣吿之「地上和平」，可能成爲事實也。</p>

<h3>「流民」兩年（中）</h3>
<p>— 顏弗</p>
<p>所內先我們而至的已滿六七百人，我們差不多是最後的第二三批了。</p>
<p>在這渣滓的一群內，有大學生，小學生，有公務員，有大腹賈，有販夫走卒，有市儈無賴，有東南西北的人……初進所時都拘禁在區舍內不許自由</p>
<p>區舍是一條長的走廊，兩旁就排列着四五十個房間，廊的高處，兩旁都是玻璃窗，每一房間又都有窗，故空氣光綫很充足，區舍中又可通兩個膳堂，盥洗處，大便處，都設備得妥善，故在區內吃喝，睡覺，洗臉，拆污都齊備了，都不用外出。</p>
<p>我們都給剃光了頭，穿上藍布製成的衫褲，房間里　地舖上稻草，又是藍布被藍布單被，滿房間鋪得藍藍地，我進所後眞感生活乏味極了。單純，原始，得使我不相信自己是生存於科學文明燦爛極點的廿世紀里！</p>
<p>同房的都是生癩疥瘡的人，滿室氣味臭得很，那濃血更東塗西抹，看見使人心戰！</p>
<p>「生疥瘡的排班沐浴啊！」走廊里有人喊着，全區舍都聽聞了。</p>
<p>「…………」只聽着沙沙移動得的聲音。</p>
<p>排班到浴室里足四五十人，大家都赤條着，有坐的，臥的，側立的，斜倚的，使我記起了李龍眠畫羅漢的一課。眞奇觀了，一個很大的浴池，水蒸氣往天窗上騰，水里散發着臭藥水的氣味，一眼便看見ΧΧ立起見，他的足部至臀部，皮膚給疥瘡生得紅黑的·遠看很像五爪金龍的爪，有些自臍以下直生滿至大腿間，像披上條一草裙一樣，渾身花斑像一隻金錢豹，池水都給油膩膩地浮散開來，我立了一會，腥臭味令人作嘔，只得往外面更衣了。</p>
<p>我思索着：這眞可說是腐蝕的人生吧！</p>
<p>大家都回到房間躺下了，搽着黃油油的藥膏，抓着那剛給湯水浸得發紅的疥癩，孜孜地，呶囌地，大家有說有笑，像給聖水剛洗禮一樣。</p>
<p>「同是天涯淪落人，相逢何必曾相識。」</p>
<p>這樣過着兩三個月的日于，大家熟絡多了，每天除吃喝之外，只悠關地躺着，回到童年的夢里，不，找尋已失落的甜美的夢。</p>
<p>不久，所里成立「農藝區」，「工藝區」，「特別區」了，各區工塲都開始工作，染病的人也跟着時日而痊愈，工作分配下來，我進工藝區草織科學習編織草包。</p>
<p>「勞工神聖」，我心在老想着，每天很早就起來，晨星發着冷冷的光芒，或白濛濛的下着大霧，寒霜盈積階前。早餐後，天還不大亮，休息一會，工作開始了，這樣地一根根稻草給帶進木機去，劈劈拍拍的木機被踏動擺出乾脆的聲音，和製草繩機隆隆的聲音混在一起，陽光才懶散地出來，照散簷際的濃霜。照散濛濛的白霧，穿過窗檻映出工塲內四週飛動的草　。</p>
<p>「勞工神聖！」我心在在老想着，不　地安慰自己。</p>
<p>當風雪交加的夜里，寒雨砭肌底淸晨，懷念起自己的身世，想到給生活高壓而轉爲溝壑的貧弱者，這怎地使我心慄，使我感覺着人與人之間互助的溫暖。雖然所內不時有人逃走，然而，我是弱者，我已馴服了，馴服得像一頭羔羊，炎炎的火總燃燒不起我死寂的心。</p>
<h3>給上海青年</h3>
<p>— 西凱</p>
<p>親愛的上海青年們：</p>
<p>我們巳闊別八年了！在遙遠的地方；在這坎坷艱難的八年中，我們是永遠惦念着你們的！　曰：「士別三日·便當括目相看！」感謝上蒼，現在括目相看的日子終於來臨了！</p>
<p>但你們是使我們太愕然了。八年以來，時代是進步了，大後方的人民也進步了，可是在你們的身上，我們見不到進步。你們還是那樣地愛好享樂；你們還是那樣地很少刻苦奮斗𨷵的精神。「你們」還是八年前的「你們」。親愛的上海青年們，你們已沉睡了八年了！</p>
<p>在關山阻越的西南方，也住着許多八年前的「你們」。他們也是享樂過的，茍安過的。可是在這血與淚交織成的八年中，他們都願意吃苦，願意奮鬥了。我不得不抱歉地說他們是比你們更有作爲些，更可期待些。他們常常奮發地說：「我們要跟家鄉人比一比！」朋友，我不禁爲你們惴惴於心了。</p>
<p>現在勝利的鐘聲已將你們的睡夢喚醒了。在慶祝歡呼之餘，你們一定也巳憧憬到自己光明的未來前程。誠然，最後勝利既巳來臨，光明的前程便屬於每一個中國的青年了。但光明的前程並不是一蹴可及的，它還是屬於那些肯吃苦肯奮鬥的中國青年的。因此我寄語每一個上海的靑年們，要求你們及時加倍努力起來！</p>
<p>在不久的將來，許多八年前的「你們」即將返歸故土。當他們對你們脫帽，鞠躬以及拉手的時候，他們是永遠不曾忘懷，「我們要跟家鄉人比一比！」的呼聲的。</p>
<p>那麼，親愛的上海青年們，你們已準備好了嗎？</p>

Now that the War of Resistance Against Japan has ended victoriously, China is about to enter a period of peaceful construction, and the current moment is extremely important. The most urgent task at present is to guarantee domestic peace, implement democratic politics, and consolidate domestic unity. Various urgent political and military issues existing within the country should be resolved rationally on the basis of peace, democracy, and unity, in order to achieve national unification and build a new China that is independent, free, and prosperous.

<h3>Chairman Chiang Hosts Tea Party to Receive General Wainwright; Chinese and American Military and Political Leaders Invited to Attend</h3>

When the Japanese army was galloping rampant and its arrogance was high, General Wainwright and his subordinates fought alone in the darkness and near despair. Their spirit is comparable to that of Wen Tianxiang in our history, who persisted to the end and resisted foreign aggression. Wen Tianxiang said, 'Since ancient times, no one has lived without death, let us leave our loyal hearts to illuminate history.' These words truly express General Wainwright's spirit. It is an honor for us to have fought alongside the brave General Wainwright and his subordinates in this battle. The General has been imprisoned by the enemy for three and a half years and has now been liberated. We are especially pleased to welcome the General to China. The Chinese people respect General Wainwright, and his fame will not only remain in the history of the United States but will also be recorded in our Chinese history."</p>
<h3>Sino-American Loan Negotiations Underway</h3>
<p>London, Reuters, 29th: The report regarding China, the Soviet Union, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands requesting the establishment of a contract lasting 30 years to purchase American goods is not true.

Yesterday, the Soviet delegation visited Mr. Crowley, the Director of the U.S. Foreign Economic Administration. Mr. Song Ziwen, President of the Executive Yuan of China, also had several meetings with Mr. Crowley. No country has expressed a willingness to sign an agreement with the United States regarding the purchase of American goods based on a 30-year contract. It seems that each country may obtain large loans from the Export-Import Bank. It is expected that the United States will provide fair credit loans to each country to replace any agreements requiring cash payments. China may obtain a loan of US$2 billion for two years of construction. At the same time, Mr. Crowley has also allocated US$1 billion in bank funds to the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Foreign Press Conference; Foreign Minister Wang Speaks; Sino-Soviet Cooperation is a Cornerstone of Peace</h3>
<p>Chongqing, 29th: A foreign press conference was held at 3:00 PM on the 29th, hosted by Foreign Minister Wang. First, he expressed his views on the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance: "The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance and related documents have been announced. This treaty resolves many important and complex issues, which I believe you are all aware of. What I personally find particularly gratifying is that in the long negotiations discussing these many issues, both sides were always considering each other's viewpoints with sympathy. The reason for this is that both sides have a strong desire to seek closer cooperation and mutual respect. The world has undergone many dramatic changes in the past few years, but this desire for cooperation and mutual respect between China and the Soviet Union has not been shaken by any world changes. This is one of the most fortunate things. The terms of the treaty are certainly very important, but even more important is the spirit of cooperation and mutual respect that lies behind the text of the treaty. The Sino-Soviet agreement will certainly be a cornerstone of world peace and security. As Commander Stalin told me, this treaty benefits not only China and the Soviet Union, but also the entire Asia and the world."</p>
<p>Striving to Resolve the KMT-CPC Issue</p>
<p>Wang continued, "Mr. Mao Zedong and Mr. Zhou Enlai arrived in Chongqing yesterday. Regarding this matter, I have no further explanation at this time, but I can solemnly tell you that the government will do its utmost to achieve internal peace and national unity. Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to you all for your past cooperation with me and to inform you that within the scope of my new duties, I will continue to do my best to facilitate your work, and I hope that you will continue to assist me."</p>

<h3>General Jiang Bocheng, as Representative, Continues to Console Allied Nationals in Concentration Camps</h3>
<p>General Jiang Bocheng, Representative of Chairman Chiang in Shanghai, invited Ambassador Yen Hui-ching and six others to represent him in visiting and comforting the foreign nationals in various concentration camps. They visited the three camps on Longhua, Zhabei, and Lincoln Road the day before yesterday morning. Yesterday morning from 8:00 AM, they continued to visit three other concentration camps in other districts. When they crossed the Huangpu River to visit the Pudong concentration camp, five American planes happened to be flying overhead. The Allied nationals in the camp cheered and the riverboats sounded their horns. The representatives proceeded to offer their condolences in this lively and tense atmosphere. The Daxilu camp they visited held 459 Allied nationals, mostly former Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) staff and teachers from Western schools. The Yangshupu camp held 1,198 people, and the Pudong camp held 1,100 people. Mr. Crow, former Principal of the Hanbury Public School, Mr. Robertson, former Acting Chief of Police of the SMC, and Mr. Ault spoke on behalf of their respective groups. They also wished General Jiang Bocheng a speedy recovery. After Mr. Yen's speech, the Allied nationals cheered and applauded thunderously. Then, Mr. He Dekui was also invited to speak, as many of the Allied nationals in the three camps were old friends of his. The translated version of Mr. Yen's speech is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Mr. Yen's Speech</p>
<p>The delegation I represent was organized by General Jiang Bocheng, the representative of Chairman Chiang in Shanghai. General Jiang is unable to come to the camps in person due to illness, so he invited myself and others to convey Chairman Chiang's condolences. Since the sudden end of the Pacific War, Chairman Chiang has been deeply concerned about the Allied nationals in the concentration camps in China and is eager to inquire about your recent situation. (Mr. Yen explained the nature of the delegation and introduced each representative.) He continued: At this moment, words and language are insufficient to express our feelings. We deeply understand your unfortunate experiences in the camps, the long loss of freedom, and the physical and mental suffering. You have been isolated from the world and separated from your compatriots and relatives in your home countries. What is most regrettable is that you were deprived of the opportunity to serve your home countries during the war. (The Allied nationals answered in unison, "Yes," with thunderous applause.) However, your strong sacrifices have also become a major factor in contributing to your home countries. During the period of confinement, some Allied friends in the camps unfortunately passed away. We should pay tribute to their spirit of sacrifice and their unwavering faith in God. Now that the nightmare has passed and light and hope have arrived, "forgetfulness" is the only natural way to eliminate unpleasantness, and I would rather offer "forgiveness" to the enemy. Without this spirit, life on Earth, with its weaknesses and evil thoughts, would be unsustainable. Most of you have lived in this second homeland for many years and have always assisted our country and people with a friendly heart.</p>
<p>China is now embarking on the road to revitalization and needs all possible assistance. With your knowledge and experience, I firmly believe that you will continue to provide us with valuable contributions. You may need to rest and recuperate in China or return to your home countries afterward, but I am confident that you will return to China to help with our reconstruction efforts. Furthermore, we firmly believe that the new alliance formed by peace-loving nations has succeeded in curbing aggression and permanently eliminating terrible wars. We hope that the "peace on Earth" proclaimed two thousand years ago may become a reality.</p>
<h3>Proclamation No. 4 of the Representative Office of the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission of the National Government stationed in Shanghai</h3>

Regarding the assets of the puppet organizations and factories, I hope you will inform all the receiving measures in the recovered areas. Before there is an order from the central government, no one may privately take over, lest they commit a crime," etc. Therefore, it is urgently proclaimed that you must comply. This proclamation!

<h3>The First Batch of Ground Troops of Our Air Force Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday: Preparing Airfields for Airborne Landings</h3>
<p>The first batch of ground troops of our Air Force arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning at 8:00 AM. Led by Air Force Commander Zhang Xuemeng, Second District Commander Zhang Jie, and Fourth Ground Service Squadron Leader Yu Zongqian, they flew to Dachang Airfield aboard four Douglas transport planes. This contingent includes dozens of officers and will prepare the airfield for the airborne landing of our massive air transport troops to Shanghai. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Departure from Chengdu</p>
<p>The large transport planes carrying officers of the Second District Command of the Air Force to Shanghai received orders from the Air Force authorities on the morning of the 28th. They took off from Chengdu at 8:45 AM that morning and arrived in Nanjing at 2:45 PM that afternoon. Second District Commander Zhang Jie immediately visited Air Force Commander-in-Chief Zhang Xuemeng, who was stationed in Nanjing, to discuss everything. They continued their flight to Shanghai at 7:30 AM yesterday morning and landed at Dachang Airfield at 8:20 AM. Commander-in-Chief Zhang Xuemeng also came on the same plane, along with two Japanese officers and Mr. Lü Hongqi, a military reporter from the Central News Agency.</p>
<p>Arrival in Shanghai</p>
<p>Around 8:00 AM, these four giant Douglas transport planes entered Shanghai. They circled low over the city several times. The citizens of the city heard the roaring engines and looked up at the sky. There were four giant planes in yellow-grey, with the national emblem of the blue sky and white sun painted on the fuselage. They immediately cheered loudly, followed by firecrackers, which echoed through the sky. Citizens along Nanjing Road and the Bund climbed onto high buildings and waved their handkerchiefs to show their welcome. The pilots on the planes reached out of the windows and waved in response. Then, they flew northeast and landed at Dachang Airfield at 8:20 AM.</p>
<p>Preparation Matters</p>
<p>After Zhang Xuemeng and Zhang Jie got off the plane, they drove with the two Japanese officers who came on the same plane to visit the Japanese Air Force responsible person stationed in Shanghai to discuss the preparation of the airfield and all matters concerning the arrival of our air transport troops in Shanghai. The other officers rested briefly on the airfield. At this time, villagers near Dachang heard the news and rushed to the airfield to express their welcome and respect to the officers of the Air Force ground troops. After a while, local villagers brought two large baskets of soda and a large number of cakes and biscuits to the Air Force troops. The enthusiasm was unprecedented.</p>
<p>Four Transport Planes</p>
<p>Of the four transport planes that flew to Shanghai yesterday, three were named "Mount Beiheng," "Atlantic," and "Pinghan," and the other one, "218," had not yet been officially named. After these four transport planes carried the ground troops to Shanghai, the Atlantic, Pinghan, and "218" immediately flew back to Nanjing. The Mount Beiheng stayed temporarily at the airfield. At 4:30 PM, it carried Commander-in-Chief Zhang Xuemeng back to Nanjing. According to reports, this was the first time our planes landed at the Shanghai airfield since the outbreak of the all-out war of resistance on August 13th.</p>
<h3>Mayor Qian Will Arrive in Shanghai Soon: Telegrams Jiang’s Representative Indicating Wait for Plane to Fly East</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reporters have obtained confirmation from the Shanghai Representative Office of the Military Affairs Commission of the National Government that Mayor Qian Dajun of this city will arrive in Shanghai soon. The original telegram from Mayor Qian to Representative Jiang on August 29 is transcribed as follows: "Representative Jiang Bocheng, Brother Bocheng, I received your telegram a few days ago. I am deeply grateful for your concern. I am currently waiting for a plane to fly east and will depart in the next few days. I am grateful for your attention and please convey this to the comrades in Shanghai. Your brother, Qian Dajun, kowtows."</p>
<h3>Two Commissioners from the Central Organization Department Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Wang Zhengjun and Sun Jialiang, commissioners from the Central Organization Department, arrived in Shanghai successively a few days ago and started working yesterday, temporarily setting up offices at 80 Haitang Road.</p>
<h3>Special Inspector Liu from the Ministry of Education Issues Statement</h3>
<p>Liu Shaozhong, Special Inspector of the Ministry of Education for Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, arrived in Shanghai a few days ago and issued the following statement yesterday: I have been ordered by the Ministry of Education to supervise educational affairs in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, as well as the two cities of Nanjing and Shanghai. Chief supervisors were originally stationed in the administrative regions of each province to carry out secret supervisory work. Since Japan accepted the Potsdam Declaration and surrendered to our Allied countries, I have been ordered to station in Shanghai to handle educational supervisory work. On behalf of the Ministry of Education, I extend my sincere condolences to the educators who have endured hardship, remained loyal, and remained unchanged from beginning to end. Education is a cultural undertaking, and educators are social leaders. At this time of transition between military and political affairs, and with the chaos of personnel matters, a moment of carelessness can easily lead to regrets. The points that should be noted are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) All middle and higher schools, whether public or private, must register. Registration forms have already been prepared. Schools at all levels in Shanghai should register with this office. Other provinces, cities, and districts should register with the chief supervisors, supervisors' offices, or巡敎團 각队部 in their respective provinces and cities.</p>
<p>(2) Before the takeover of all levels of schools established by the puppet regime, all school property, equipment, books, documents, and other public property must not be moved without authorization. If there is any loss or sale, once discovered, the person originally in charge will be severely punished according to law.</p>
<p>(3) All new and old bookstores, second-hand shops, and private individuals must not purchase items owned by Japanese puppet schools and cultural organizations at all levels. Once discovered, not only will the purchased items be confiscated, but they will also be severely punished.</p>
<p>(4) Finally, I hope that the responsible persons of schools and social education institutions at all levels will comply with the 14 articles of the Educational Rehabilitation Work Measures for Recovered Areas recently promulgated by the Ministry of Education. Other issues to be decided will, I believe, soon have more detailed instructions from the central educational authorities.</p>
<h3>Yesterday the News Inspection Office Hosted Various Newspapers</h3>
<p>The Shanghai News Inspection Office was formally established on the 28th of this month. The newly appointed Director Wang Jinqi and Deputy Director Jiang Jianhou, in order to promote inspection work, hosted a grand tea party at the Yijia Chun Restaurant on Fuzhou Road yesterday (29th) afternoon at 2:00 PM, inviting responsible persons and editors-in-chief from various newspapers in the city.

At this time of victory in the War of Resistance and the recovery of our territory, the task of the press is extremely important, and its impact on the general society is even greater. I hope that various newspapers will strictly exercise self-discipline in the publication of news in the future and be particularly cautious. At the same time, various newspapers should establish closer contact with this office to jointly promote the spirit of the nation. Finally, representatives from various newspapers exchanged views on news inspection work, and the atmosphere was very pleasant. It ended at around 6:00 PM.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Three Municipal Affairs</h3>
<p>— Cheng</p>
<p>The municipal administration of this city, especially in terms of public health, should be actively maintained until the new authorities have formally taken over. Moreover, there will soon be large-scale victory celebrations, making the cleanliness of the city even more important. The following three things should be noted:</p>
<p>(1) Street lights on thoroughfares should be restored to their pre-war brightness. The former International Settlement has been gradually restored, and the Nanshi and former French Concession should also be universally restored. It is hoped that the utilities department will pay attention.</p>
<p>(2) Many air-raid shelters have not been filled and contain dirt and filth. This is not only unhygienic but also unsightly due to the unevenness of the ground. It is hoped that the 保甲 will pay attention and persuade citizens to clean and fill them.</p>
<p>(3) Some road surfaces are uneven. Road maintenance should not be interrupted. It is hoped that the public works department will pay attention. Furthermore, the urine and feces on some roadsides are harmful to public health. It is hoped that the police and health departments will pay attention to correcting this.</p>
<h3>"Drifters" Two Years (Middle)</h3>
<p>— Yan Fu</p>
<p>Six to seven hundred people had arrived at the institution before us, and we were almost the last second or third batch.</p>
<p>Within this group of dregs, there were university students, primary school students, civil servants, wealthy merchants, peddlers, and city slickers. There were people from all over the country... When we first entered the institution, we were confined to the district quarters and not allowed freedom.</p>
<p>The district quarters were a long corridor, with forty or fifty rooms lined up on both sides. High up in the corridor, on both sides were glass windows, and each room also had windows, so the air and light were plentiful. The district quarters also had access to two dining halls, washing facilities, and latrines, all well-equipped, so eating, drinking, sleeping, washing, and disposing of waste were all available in the district and there was no need to go outside.</p>
<p>We were all shaved bald and dressed in blue cloth shirts and trousers. In the rooms, straw was spread on the floor for bedding, with blue cloth blankets and blue cloth sheets, covering the entire room in blue. After entering the institution, I felt that life was extremely boring. Simple and primitive, it made me not believe that I was living in the 20th century, the pinnacle of scientific civilization!</p>
<p>My roommates all had scabies, and the room reeked. The thick pus was smeared everywhere, making my heart tremble!</p>
<p>"Those with scabies line up for bathing!" someone shouted in the corridor, heard throughout the district quarters.</p>
<p>"............" Only the rustling sound of movement could be heard.</p>
<p>Forty or fifty people lined up in the bathroom, all naked, some sitting, some lying down, some standing sideways, some leaning, reminding me of Li Longmian's painting of Arhats. It was truly a spectacle. A large bath, with steam rising to the skylight, and the smell of stinky medicinal water spreading in the water. I immediately saw ΧΧ standing up, with his skin from his feet to his buttocks covered in red and black scabies, looking like the claws of a five-clawed golden dragon from afar. Some had it growing straight from below the navel to the thighs, like wearing a grass skirt. His whole body was mottled like a leopard. The pool water was covered in a greasy film. I stood for a while, and the fishy, stinky smell made me nauseous, so I had to go outside to change.</p>
<p>I pondered: This can truly be said to be a corrosive life!</p>
<p>Everyone returned to their rooms and lay down, applying yellow ointment and scratching the scabies that had just turned red from the hot water, diligently and murmuringly, everyone talking and laughing, as if they had just been baptized with holy water.</p>
<p>"We are all people fallen from the ends of the earth, why must we have known each other before?"</p>
<p>We spent two or three months like this. Everyone became much more familiar. Every day, besides eating and drinking, we just lay around leisurely, returning to the dreams of childhood, no, searching for the lost sweet dreams.</p>
<p>Soon, the institution established "Agricultural Arts Area," "Industrial Arts Area," and "Special Area." The workshops in each area began to work, and the sick gradually recovered over time. Work was assigned, and I entered the grass weaving section of the Industrial Arts Area to learn to weave grass bags.</p>
<p>"Labor is sacred," I kept thinking in my heart. I got up very early every day, with the morning stars shining coldly, or a white, misty fog falling, and frost accumulating before the steps. After breakfast, it was not yet bright, and after a short rest, work began. In this way, one by one, strands of rice straw were brought into the wooden machine. The wooden machine being stepped on made a crisp sound, mixed with the rumbling sound of the grass rope making machine. The sunlight lazily came out, scattering the thick frost at the edge of the eaves, scattering the misty white fog, and reflecting the flying grass debris inside the workshop through the window sills.</p>
<p>"Labor is sacred!" I kept thinking in my heart, constantly comforting myself.</p>
<p>During snowy nights, and cold rainy mornings that pricked at the skin, I missed my own background, and thought of the poor and weak who had been turned into gullies by the high pressure of life. How could this not make my heart tremble, making me feel the warmth of mutual assistance between people. Although people occasionally escaped from the institution, I was weak. I was already tamed, tamed like a lamb. The raging fire could never ignite my dead heart.</p>
<h3>To the Youth of Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Xi Kai</p>
<p>Dear young people of Shanghai:</p>
<p>We have been separated for eight years! In distant places, in these difficult and arduous eight years, we have always been thinking of you! It is said: "When a scholar has been away three days, he should be looked at with new eyes!" Thank heaven, the day for looking with new eyes has finally arrived!</p>
<p>But you have left us utterly surprised. In the eight years since, the times have progressed, and the people of the rear have also progressed, but we do not see progress in you. You still love to enjoy yourselves; you still lack the spirit of hard work and struggle. "You" are still the "you" of eight years ago. Dear young people of Shanghai, you have been asleep for eight years!</p>
<p>In the southwest, blocked by mountains and passes, there also live many of the "you" of eight years ago. They also enjoyed themselves and lived in complacency. But in these eight years woven with blood and tears, they have all been willing to endure hardship and willing to struggle. I must apologize and say that they are more accomplished than you and more worthy of expectation. They often say spiritedly: "We want to compete with the people of our hometown!" Friends, I can't help but feel worried for you.</p>
<p>Now the bells of victory have awakened you from your slumber. After celebrating and cheering, you must also have been imagining your own bright future. Indeed, now that the final victory has arrived, a bright future belongs to every young person in China. But a bright future is not something that can be achieved overnight; it still belongs to those young people in China who are willing to endure hardship and willing to struggle. Therefore, I say to every young person in Shanghai, I ask you to redouble your efforts in time!</p>
<p>In the near future, many of the "you" of eight years ago will return to their homeland. When they tip their hats, bow, and shake hands with you, they will never forget the cry of "We want to compete with the people of our hometown!"</p>
<p>So, dear young people of Shanghai, are you ready?</p>
