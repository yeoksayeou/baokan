<h3>首里市街一部被突入　日軍展開迎擊戰　航空隊繼績猛攻敵艦船羣</h3>
<p>東京二日中央社電　冲繩本島南部地區，現仍繼續展開激鬥，敵軍攻擊重點爲來海岸方面，向與那原南方地區首里市，首里·那新間之日軍陣地侵入，日軍則展開激烈之迎學戰。日航空部隊爲策應起見，繼績對本島四周之敵艦船羣加以攻擊，予以相當損害，倚恃物量之敵軍攻勢，現巳不容吾人輕視。又敵機動部隊現已脫出琉球海域日軍特攻隊之攻擊圈外，欲圖重整陣容，几其陸上基地已屢　日統空隊猛襲及空挺部隊之奮戰，蒙極大損害，然仍傾莫全力，重行構築基地。又列島全戰綫來襲之敵機數，二十七日爲八十餘架，二十九日爲九十架左右，三十日爲八十架左右，自六月一日以來，復增至二百架左右，對九州南部曾有敵機五十架來製，可知敵基地勢力已整備至相當地步。敵軍於向日軍猛攻前，曾蒙重大損害，然仍使多數兵力於冲繩登陸，并繼續補充物資，登陸敵軍約八師至十師左右，爲籮持此龐大部隊，其補給亦須增大，因是日軍之特攻予敵影響甚大。</p>
<p>西南方面基地二日中央社電　冲繩本島之陸上戰鬥，於首里·那　兩市繼續展開激烈之攻防戰，敵漸次迫近日軍陣地，企圖突破，首里市街已被一部敵軍攻入，日軍對此迎擊，展開肉搏激鬥中，該方面敵兵，自空中投下物資，以補充補給之困難。</p>
<p>南西羣島基地二日中央社電　日來冲繩本島之氣候不佳，故日美兩軍之航空作戰未呈活躍。敵機之活動狀况，一日來襲冲繩本島者僅七十架，來襲列島全綫僅二百架，又冲繩本烏北·中兩飛機塲之敵機，似已逐漸增强實力。</p>

<p>西南太基地一日中央社電　日空軍前於二十六，二十八，二十九夜間攻擊泰拉千之敵軍事設備及敵陣地，予以重創，又對　　其優勢物資之敵軍攻勢，日軍亦堅守陣地，歷時三旬有餘，繼績勇門，該島守備軍士氣愈益昂揚，與日空軍之功擊相策應，反覆猛烈肉搏攻擊，收獲果甚大。</p>
<h3>日空挺　奇襲情景</h3>
<p>蘇黎世二日中央社電　據巴黎來電，「通報」冲繩特派員，五月二十六日報告日空挺部隊於敵機塲强行降落之悽慘情景稱，二十五日夜，日空挺部隊突於冲繩美飛機塲强行降落，當時該機塲停有美機數百架，日雙引整轟炸機中之日軍空挺部隊，即衝入其中。據基地司令官斯密斯中校推測，日機每機乘有兵士十二至十五名，彼等携有手溜彈，炸彈，尚帶有數日用之食糧。當日機降落後，機中之兵爭先躍出，司令塔中某將校立即加急射擊，於塔之近處斃日兵一名，然其自身因胸部受刺刀戰穿而死。日航空部隊爲輿此空挺隊相呼應，是夜隊美飛行塲大肆轟炸，其轟炸時間前後歷八小時，實冲　作戰開始以來之最大規模轟炸。</p>
<h3>大隅薩摩半島　昨晨空襲</h3>
<p>福岡二日中央社電　敵艦載機二百餘架，分成十架至三十架之　個編隊，由飛艇四架引導，於二日上午八時迄八時半　，主要於大隅半島，宮崎縣北部，薩摩半島，熊本縣南部，對於日軍航空基地加以攻擊，並對一部列車加以機槍掃射，八時半左右，由海上逸去，日方損害輕微。</p>

<h3>今日六三節　盼全國厲行烟禁</h3>
<p>南京二日中央社電　今（三）日爲六三烟節，回憶百年前公元一八三九年，即前道光十九年，我兩廣總督林文忠公，洞察英美帝國主義者毒化中國之陰謀，毅然在廣東虎門，將英商二萬餘箱鴉片悉數焚毀，事後英帝國主義更挾其槍砲迫我開戰，此即我歷史上慘痛一頁之鴉片戰爭。百餘年來，鴉片遂公然流入，自由販吸，榨取我金融，麻醉我人民，以致國勢日浚，言之殊堪痛心。迨民國二十四年，我注故主席在行政院任內，奉行國父拒毒遺訓，頒布五年禁烟法令，雷厲推行，惜未幾八一三事變發生，致又鬆弛。大東亞戰爭爆發，靑年　目時艱，爲喚起全國民衆發奮圖强，爰有轟動全國之十二·十七運動展開。迄去年三月，國府又重申前令，議續厲行禁政，在內政部下特設禁烟總局，以專職成，其後更爲强調禁政之推進，又改隸軍委會辦理，迄今雖已年餘，而所得效果未臻圓滿。際茲六三禁烟節，吾人緬懷林文忠公之卓見遠謀，深盼禁烟當局貫澈始終，勿稍懈怠，更盼全國民衆從此覺醒，勿再售吸，自戕生命。</p>
<p>蕪湖二日中央社電　禁烟節將届，本縣靑少年團部爲喚起民衆認識此有意義之紀念日，定是日上午九特，假靑年館舉行紀念儀式，屆時各中小學校團部均將參加。</p>

<p>地方通訊</p>
<h3>申江縣全貌（上）</h3>
<p>— 余昆</p>
<p>水陸交通</p>
<p>申江縣位於東南海濱之區，當黃浦江與吳淞江入海之會，去吳淞三十五里，　黃海匯，南界奉賢，以黃浦江爲分界綫，西連松江縣，北與上海市相　。地勢平坦，無形勝之可言，惟河港縱橫，以黃浦江及橫涇爲幹，黃浦江流經東南東境界，橫涇自　行北經華莊，通嘉定；此外有六磊塘，關塘，兪塘等均爲黃浦江支河，惟兪塘今已淤塞不通矣。再有竹岡塘與沙港塘則與橫涇平行。</p>
<p>本縣交通向稱便利，陸上有滬　南拓路，由上海市至縣境閔行鎭，全綫長六十四里，戰後失修，路面損壞者頗多，行車因雌，汽車約行一小時許。目前駛行此路者，據記者所知有三：一爲華中長途汽車，營業所設上海南市陸家　路，售賣下列車票及駛行滬　綫驛站，由南市經斜土路，吳家巷，錢糧廟，　橋，北橋而抵閔行。票價由南市到閔行爲六千五百元，斜土路到閔行爲五千元，其餘按站遞減。駛行時間，上海道　行為上午八時三十分，十時三十分，下午一時。二時三十分，共四班。二爲滬閔汽車公司，營業所在滬南斜土路，純爲小汽車，票價不論遠近，每位四千四百元，每車可乘六七人，滿座即開，時同不定。三爲中華汽車運輸公司，營業所在六爲路湖北路南，亦係小汽車，票價每位七千元，獨包侮車四萬五千元，每車可乘七人，時間不定，聞不久即將漲價。</p>
<p>水路因沿濱黃浦，戰前　橋林立，輸行如織，現僅有華中內河輸船行駛道，每日有按班行駛之小輸，與平湖，上海等地相連貫，上海開出時間爲侮長八時，船票每位四千元，輪行四小時可抵閔行鎭。尙有划船行對江渡，往來於黃浦江中，連絡閔行至南滙曹涇之旅客。今後如在輪船方面增加班次，則運輸將更形暢達矣。</p>
<p>治安第一</p>
<p>本縣治安非常穩定，本環境市區七縣之中（嘉定，　山，崇明，申江，川沙，南滙，奉買），居第一位，境內尙無渝共軍隊隱匿其間，民間頗現安樂之象。目前以滬　公路爲界，路以西駐保安隊，以東駐中央稅警國，沿江及各區鎭，尚有日方警備隊及警察協助。各部隊員均受嚴格訓練，且配備精良，更因駐地長官，督導有方，治軍恩威並施賞　　明，故軍紀肅然，勒索及其他不法行爲，尚少見聞。此外各區並組有自警團，團員均經選拔，而嚴加訓練者。故地方盜　等　，望而生畏，罪案亦因此減少。最近尙有保安隊一中隊，在　行鎭郊外，操練至勤，每値晨昏，時聞高唱軍歌與口號，精神飽滿，此畫決非普通軍　所可比擬。</p>
<p>農田物產木縣土地肥沃，宜於極値，尤以沿浦地　，間有砂　，最宜種棉，全縣田地約在二十萬　左右，人口僅八萬餘名。所有田畝均係一等上則熟田，絕少荒廢，且因地屬平原，是以森林較少，由畝價格綦貴，戰前平均每畝百元左右，今則値價僅六石米。</p>
<p>木縣農業以棉爲大宗，田畝棉七稻三，農民自有田產約占三分之一，租種者約佔三分之二。自食糧飛漲後，比年更種　　者，已較往昔增多十分之三，棉花市場遂爲改色。在江蘇省統一政令之下，田賦從去年起開征田賦規定侮畝一斗，分二期征收，第一期征三升，第二期征七升，田租稻每畝六斗，棉田每畝四十斤。</p>
<p>人民糧食以米爲主，惟全縣米糧產額與人口數計核，僅足維持半年之久，必須告糴　封或他地，以資接濟，故米之來源，皆仰諸松江，金山等地，設一旦來源斷絕，恐慌立生。記者　達之日，米價僅爲十五萬元，因受上海米價（十八萬五千）之影嚮，更因西鄉松江適値軍米期內，　出因難，致當地米價逐步上漲。</p>
<p>天生物產，隨其土之所宜而定，今舉其大耍路述之。五穀之類：稻種甚繁，麥有大小二種，養麥粒似黑牽牛子。豆有黃白二種，收麥後與稱奉相半種。他如黍·菉豆，赤豆·蠶豆，豌豆等皆間種，自扁豆種籬落間。蔬菜之類：如萵苣，絲瓜近多傳種，山藥，黃獨，香芋出邑西浦江畔。菓類多柑橘；羽·　·介·蓄等，間而有之。</p>
<p>風俗民生簾來土著，務農者居多，人民祟尚儉樸，無上海市浮華之習，衣食起居，均極節省，衣服以土布爲多，惟中上階級——間用綢緞。最近風俗丕變，男女衣着漸尚新奇，而烟賭之風較盛，貪惰日多。半公開之售吸所，在閔行鎭上約有二三處，一般茶肆，賣茶其名，抽頭聚賭是實，比年鄉村好問子弟之入其穀而敗家者，數見不鮮。事變後，離婚解約之事，亦有所聞。人民之不識字者，喜　事鬼神，遇有疾病，每先禳後醫，費錢不惜，婚嫁喪葬，一依星命。一言括之，風俗日漓，此實社會之不幸，冀當局設法取締，而積極改革之，實國家地方之福也。（未完）</p>
<h3>戰犯調查委會　在倫敦集議</h3>
<p>瑞典京城二日中央社電　據倫敦公報稱：出席昨日在倫敦舉行戰時犯罪調查委員會會議之美國代表　格遜，於席間建議設立「中央戰時犯罪記錄部」，集中各國所　集之戰時犯罪報告，如此則可取消目前十六國個別組織之戰爭犯罪調查部，及聯合國司令部內所設立之軍用通訊部，蓋該項組織僅能從事於單獨性之調查偵察及記錄證據等各項事宜，而絕不能相互連絡或交換報告。</p>
<h3>法駐軍奉命停戰法叙有議和可能　倫敦將舉行三國會談</h3>
<p>里斯本二日中央社電據巴黎電，法國政府當局一日發表聲明如次：法當局已對叙利亞法駐軍司令官發下訓令，命其於必要時可採取一切措置，然須澈底根據協和精神而行動。又據倫敦電稱，英外交當局亦於一日確認駐屯里文達法軍最高司令官已對部下軍隊發令，命其部下停止戰鬥，歸還原防</p>
<p>里斯本二日中央社電據倫敦公報稱：苦戰五日之後，「停止開火」之消息已傳遍叙利亞國境，同时此消息亦表示法叙間能有議和之可能。法國接受英政府之要求，已由艾登外相在英下院報告至詳，目前將於倫敦舉行三國會談。據傳特戈爾將軍將現自參加該會，衆信艾登及美駐英大使威納特將分別爲英美兩國之代表。</p>
<p>蘇聯方面表示關心瑞京城二日中央社電據莫斯科電台發表：蘇政府要求英美法渝四國政府應積極採取和平方法，調解里文達糾紛，蓋該項糾紛實對舊金山會議有所衝突。</p>

<h3>政與邪教</h3>
<p>— 吳中行</p>
<p>知天下之事，何以流極而至於斯，則思起而拯之；」</p>
<p>「今日者拯斯人於塗炭，爲萬世開太平，此吾輩之任也。」——顧亭林</p>
<p>歷史事實的教訓</p>
<p>今日的農村已經到了「傾而未頹，決而未潰」的地步。最近喧傳一時的無鍚先天逍的妄動，也許就是農村「傾而將頹，決而將潰」的先兆。我們不能不爲「人心陷溺」而嗟歡，也不能不爲農民「挺而走險」而危懼。當前的急務，不僅必須治標，并且尤須治本；不僅必須對症發藥，并且尤須正本淸源。</p>
<p>我們回想中國的歷史，焚香聚徒，斂米入教的淵源也很久遠。漢之張魯，張角，晋之孫恩，處循，六朝及唐川蜀之米賊，宋之儂知高，明之劉六，劉七，趙風子，徐鴻儒，唐賽兒，淸之白蓮教，天理教等類的帶有宗教性質的作亂，都起於　紀敗壞之時，與秕政有着密切的關係。現在，我們固然不必將先天道作過高的評價，可是我們也不能忽略了歷史事實的教訓。</p>
<p>就大家耳熟能詳的白蓮教來說，曾經作亂了九年，蔓延了五省。從淸朝嘉慶元年正月湖北省枝江和宜都兩縣發端，滋擾了河南·陝西·四川·甘肅數省，入一村燒一村，入一鎭燒一鎭，往來奔鎭，造成了淸朝中葉第一次的大混亂。這是歷史不可諱言的事實，我們忠實的分析當時的原因，有下列諸點：</p>
<p>一·地方吏治之敗壞淸乾隆帝死後，權臣和坤的最狀暴露。彼二十餘年間攬權奢侈，不法營私，蠶國病民，貪婪　貨，賄賂是求的罪惡，種下了民亂的原因。地方官吏因爲上有好之者，所以變本加厲，以致「橫征暴斂，挪新掩舊，小民困於迫呼，而莫之或恤。」</p>
<p>二·革命思想之潛伏　淸朝全盛時代，民問雖有恢復明室的思想，亦無法活動，至此有所謂「扶保牛八」之說，牛八即「朱」字之暗記，又有「明王出生」之諺，即顯示對於明朝之懷念，民亂之中不免有人操從利用。</p>
<p>三，佛教傳說之煽惑當時有所謂「三敎應　總觀通書「出現·稱燃燈佛·釋迦佛·儞勒佛爲三劫，以彌勒佛之再生爲號召，於是爲生活而苦悶之農民因此受到蠱惑而貿然作亂。</p>
<p>至於此種變亂所以能不住擴大的原因，不外下列二點：</p>
<p>一·吏胥之激變，當變亂初起時，尚易鎭壓，可是吏胥借此勒索，「不間習教不習教，只見給錢不給錢」，於是更加深農民隱恨，以致激變。</p>
<p>二·脋從之增加　變亂後，家宅被毀，財產皆盡之農民，不得不被脅從，因此經日愈久，而無身家衣食之民附麗之者愈衆。</p>
<p>總之·「左道禍亂」的本質，如梅曾亮所論：「天下有亂民，有姦民，毒官吏，迫飢寒，挺刃而卒起，索黨與隨和以自救，此亂民之招誘愚舊，而名之曰教，是爲姦民。……且夫教之名，民所不易受於長上者也，而匹夫能得之於鄉里，非民之所能爲也，勢也。」所以，我們無論在檢討白蓮教，或是歷史上其他的變亂，以至今日的先天道，不僅要注意現象的演變，最主要還是要留意「勢」之所以造成的原因，不能不作「未雨綢繆」，「因勢力導」之計。</p>
<p>今日失態的分析</p>
<p>先天道流佈於江南的歷史還很短淺，開始於民國三十二年四月，到現在還只有二年，現在為亂業不過無錫鄕間及其　縣的一小部份，與白蓮教之亂成其他變亂來比校，可以說還是在發端的初期，其「勢」雖然逐漸醖釀成功，然而現在我們還未始不可以「因勢利導」，使之逐漸弭平下去。</p>
<p>不過，我們應該注意分析的·便是所以造成今日農村「傾而將頹，決而將潰」的原因，現在一面敘述先天道的發展經過，一面指摘邪教所以與秕政結合之根由。</p>
<p>一·鄉間雜色軍隊之壓迫　首魁某從華北請求先天道到無鍚傳道的動機，由於身受常時流動於澄錫處三縣縣境遊擊隊的勒索，痛苦不堪，然後出走北京，過先天道總會會長，誤認先天道爲打開農村危機之唯一法門。後來，先天道的信徒不斷與當地駐在雜色軍隊爲敵，也是因爲不堪壓迫怨憤塡膺的緣故。</p>
<p>二·佛家思想之影嚮先天道一名「佛力保家會」，此點與白蓮教鼓吹彌勒佛再生思想非常相近。因爲農民歷受重重壓迫之餘，認爲可以得救的，只有信賴佛力。這是因爲利用民間固有信仰，而獲得多數信徒的原因。甚至以爲到香堂前禮拜之後，可以刀劍不入的迷信，業是從這一點出發的。</p>
<p>三·苛捐雜稅之繁重　先天道的信徒屢次曾經聚衆製擊鄉鎭公所，或徵稅所，這是鄉鎮長之不足以服人，徵稅吏之結怨於農民的緣故。農民超禍於無言忍耐的相當限度，而發爲越規的行動，也是歷史上的變亂中常有的事實。</p>
<p>四·對於利用徵收米糧之名而勒索作惡者之怨恨　農民對於米糧徵收決不是不肯協力，第一因爲收買米糧者的熊度不良而起怨恨，第而因爲明知收買者之舞弊而起憤懣，是以有人揭竿而起，便一呼百應。米糧之收買其弊不在原則，而在機構，今日農民陷於「家種二畝田，頭枕衙門眠」的慘狀，因此對於負責收買米糧之辦事處也加以襲擊。</p>
<p>總之，農民的信念，並不在先天道的理論或組織一而在農村自衛這一點。農村自衛是他們的目的，而先天道不過是他們的手段，或者說是他們百無辦法中的一種武器。農民所以造成妄動的原因，歸納起來說，第一是民生的問題，第二是教育的問題。因爲教育不普及，所以「人心纖弱」，又因爲民生困苦，所以「挺而走險」。我們認爲要　平先天道直妄動，不必要武力區撲減，也不必用手腕去懷柔，主要的還是要對這二點「對症發藥」，然后得受「正本淸源」之效。</p>
<p>德治的根本方案</p>
<p>在淸朝中葉白蓮教之亂盛行的時候，洪亮吉的「征邪教疏」是非常有名的。洪亮吉雖然以此得罪，發遺伊犂，然而嘉慶帝也稱贊爲「不値因洪容吉之語，細爲剖自」，並且洪亮吉的態度的確是站在憂國憂民的立塲，他的方案也是以一正本情源」爲目標的。我們今日在檢討先天道的時候，也可以舉出來作爲參考。洪亮吉的辦法共有三點：</p>
<p>第一：脅從宜貨　洪亮吉因爲目擊當時白蓮教之亂時日愈久，附麗者愈多，所以力主脅從宜貸的辦法，並且說：「殺數千人數百人者即此無業之流民，非眞邪教也，非眞賊也，且此曹每州縣動輒以萬計，可以盡殺乎，即可盡教，亦非如天之仁所忍出此也。」議論非常精闢。所謂脅從宜貸的功效，從正國說，是開愚民自新之路，從反面說，是離邪教的黨羽。這次江蘇省所定之原則，「一面嚴處先天道之指導者，一面勸告受愚民衆，促其醒悟，知所炯戒，」的確也是治本之計。</p>
<p>第二：吏治宜肅　洪亮吉在意言篇中曾經論過當時的吏胥，認爲「上足以把握官府，中足以凌脅士大夫，下足以魚肉里閭」，并且以虎狼譬如吏胥：「蓋吏之暴如虎，與其使一州邑多數十百虎也，毋寗減之又減，今州縣之大者，　吏至千任，次至七八百人，至少亦一二百人，此千人至一二百人者男不耕，女不織，皆仰食於民也無疑矣，大率十家之民不是以供一吏，至有千吏，則萬家之邑，亦囂然矣。」他的議論對於今日也未始不切當，希望當局對於鄕間　技機關盡量裁撤，對於鄕鎭長人選盡量嚴格甄別，凡有蝕糧，旨餉，敲詐，賄賂者處之重刑，然後「可舒萬姓之冤，亦可塞邦民之口。」</p>
<p>第三：責成宜事　此飭洪亮吉力言守土者之責，因爲白蓮教曾蔓延五省，所以主張必須專其責成。現在先天道固然範圍尚小，各縣縣畏也應該專其責成，以免此去彼來，此討彼去、白蓮教亂時所調：「賊至兵無影，兵來賊又沒蹤」的情形，就是因爲不專責守之故。我們雖不主張武力討伐，但是守土之責是不可不專的。</p>
<p>其次；米糧收買的機構不能不改善，荷捐雜稅也不能不消除。米糧收買機構的改善，第一，必須不使農民直接趕到痛苦，第二，盡量利用各地固有的傅統習慣，可以活用，第三·尊重當地土紳及農民意見，以適當價格，及適當數量收買。至於荷捐雜稅之利弊更是非常明顯，而且大多不出自當局，而由各地鄕鎭巧立各目，沿途勒索者，只須當局縣以嚴禁，便可革除其弊，　益農民當不在少。</p>
<p>要之，在今日農村「傾而未頹，決而未潰」的時候，我們應該盡量「因勢利導」，就是妄動已經發端，也還可以立即「對症發藥」。否則，如梅會亮所論：「夫民所樂趨之事，而不爲利導之，草野之間，必有因民之欲，竊吾意以售其　者。其始特出於私立名字，欲財　，賽會微逐而已，而其後遂爲有國者之憂。至於爲有國者之憂，蓋非獨從而和者不樂也，而亦豈倡之者之始意及此哉。然而勢必至乎此者何也？吾爲之說以導之，吾聚之，吾能散之，故其權在上；民自爲聚者，非法之所許也，民知意不出於上，而恐法及已也，　　然有與上相持之心，其勢遂聚而不可復散，故日，非民之所能爲也，勢也。」今日此種形勢雖然正在逐漸醞釀，還可以及早下手，勵行治本之計。</p>
<p>雖然我們不欲將先天道過高評價，但是　結所在，不在現象，而在根本，不在邪教而在　政。我們要防星星之火的燎原，只能堅決主張：革除　政，然后絕滅邪教。在民不聊生的今日，決不能再　本逐末，應該從速收　民心，改革機構，勵精圖治！</p>
<h3>法政府　繼績爭認弗郞哥</h3>
<p>里斯本二日中央社電據瑪德里公報稱：法政府已正式通告西班牙謂，雖法國民諮議院之外交委員會曾決定邀請各聯合國一致請求弗朗哥將軍辭職，及准允民意樹立自由總選舉，然我法政府當局將決不重視此種決定性之建議。</p>
<h3>英對蒂托　提新建議</h3>
<p>謀解决領土紛爭</p>
<p>蘇黎世二百中央社電英軍方面爲急於解決托里埃斯特問題，有對蒂托提出新建議之意。交換電訊社羅馬電報曾稱，地中海方面聯合軍司令亞歷山大爲解決托里埃斯特紛爭，預定於六月二日在貝爾格勒與蒂托會見，届時如南斯拉夫軍保障交通綫安全，則英方將表明自伊斯的里雅半島東部撤回駐軍之意，然英軍爲維持奧地利駐軍計，決不能放棄托里埃斯特，且正急於樹立托里埃斯特·哥里哈兩地區英美軍政府，故蒂托恐不能簡單接受亞歷山大之和　。</p>
<h3>未檢定度量衝器　蘇省府令取締</h3>
<p>蘇州二日中央社電</p>
<p>各縣鄉間度量衝器，不邇法令任便出售，實足以紊亂度政之推行，是以各縣度量衝檢定分所特先後呈請省檢定所，轉呈省府通令各現，責成鄕保長予以取締，以利劃一，省府昨已通令各縣遵照辦理，務將出品送交當地主管機關檢定後，始得出售。</p>
<h3>英對印方針决定印督華維爾返任</h3>
<p>里斯本二日中央社電印度總督華維爾，自三月二十三臼歸國以來，即與邱吉爾首相阿特里等，一再協議印度問題，然因其問曾經歐戰結束，及舊金山會議開幕，國際情勢重大轉變，致未能圓滿解決印度問題。最近英政府對印方針業已決定，是以華維爾於本月一日由空路歸任，至所決定之對印方針尚未公佈。頃路透社論述，就華維爾之歸任曾報到如此：華維爾行將以全權處治印度一切障碍，而導印人於正途。</p>
<p>瑞典京城二日中央社電　據倫敦報告稍，印度總督華維爾勛　與英政府會談歷時數周後，昨日啓程返印。又據路透社某政治訪員談稱，偸敦政治界均深信此次華維爾勛爵之訪英，必曾研究如何開展印度之政治僵局，同時商討如何獲得興執政之印度各黨及領袖間合作。</p>

<h3>趙檢察長　談在任興革　榮任法次不日離滬</h3>
<p>本市地方檢察署檢察長趙延鏜，奉令榮任司法行政部次長後，茲以離滬在即，特於昨日招待記浙，發表談話，略謂：「本人自到任以來，為時雖僅一年有餘，然對各種署務，無不力加改革。　對於犯罪輕微者，在可能範圍內，儘量厲行保釋，因此減少看守所擁擠情況。　過去在滬法警隊，傒獨立性質，弊端　免，乃隸屬於地方檢察署，由本人自兼隊長，加以指揮，所將成緬，尚稱滿意。！本人離滬後，檢察長一職，由本署首席檢察官孫家傑實代，一切內部人事，均無更動。」</p>
<h3>航運業派輸　採運米糧</h3>
<p>昨據航運業方面消息，該業以目前本市食糧售價狂漲，民食問題嚴重，爰經關係當局之特許，於前昨兩日專派航輸數艘，駛往蘇北各口採運。聞日內即有大量食米及豆麥等運滬。</p>
<h3>華中烟草配給　決定變更辦法　捲煙零售商店一律撤銷</h3>

<h3>本期戶口麵粉　七日起發售　每證一市斤</h3>
<p>市物品配給處，業巳本令　撤，所有配給事宜，劃歸市經濟局設科辦理，該局鑒於日來米價暴漲，市民　受威脅，除積極籌商穩定米市外，同時爲解除市民食糧恐慌，對本期戶口麵粉發售事宜，巳籌備此緒，定於下週四（六月七日）起發售全市區戶口麵粉，至同月十二日爲止，届時一律憑第四七耽綜合配給證，向指定商號領購號麺粉一市斤，售價國幣四百元。</p>
<h3>最近物資移動　情況暢利</h3>
<p>近來物資移動之搬出入悄况，尚稱暢利。華中。華南。華北。淮海等地區之輸出輸入物資數量，雖無統計以作比較，然據物資移動中請許可事務所，及物資統制審　委員會上海事務所方面消息，最近所有移動物資申請許可，及共審議手續，均較以往更爲迅速。其否決可決等等文件，及決定之期間，至長僅及一過，最速者僅一二日即可決定。搬入上海地區，以麻袋及藍　製品佔首位，各地重要物資次之。搬出華中及華南淮海等處，則以顏料首位，日用品及主要各商品次之。但運輸工具供應不敷，影響物資種出人匪淺，深望當局及早設法解決此事。</p>
<h3>隔日交還票據　不能實行</h3>
<p>關於華商銀行公會與外商銀行公會所倡設之隔日交換票據事宜，原可積極期其實行，解除收支上所生之困難，但現以錢業公會考慮結果，已表示不能同意。據悉此事銀行同業雖均贊成，然以錢業之異議，事實上巳無實行之可能性，藍以銀錢兩業各大行莊往來交換票據甚多，倘銀行單獨實行隔日交換，錢業仍以當日交換，則其障碍尤多。</p>

<h3>Part of the City of Shuri Breached; Japanese Army Launches Counterattack; Air Force Continues Fierce Assault on Enemy Fleet</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - Fierce fighting continues in the southern part of Okinawa Island. The enemy's main attack is focused on the coast, and they have infiltrated the Japanese army positions between Shuri City and Naha, south of Yonabaru. The Japanese army is launching a fierce counterattack. The Japanese air force, in support, continues to attack enemy fleets around the island, inflicting considerable damage. The enemy's offensive, relying on sheer volume of material, cannot be underestimated. Furthermore, the enemy's mobile force has withdrawn from the Japanese special attack force's range in the Ryukyu waters, attempting to regroup. Their land bases have been repeatedly subjected to fierce attacks by the Japanese air force and the valiant efforts of airborne units, suffering enormous damage. However, they are still exerting all their strength to rebuild their bases. The number of enemy aircraft attacking the entire island chain was over 80 on the 27th, around 90 on the 29th, and around 80 on the 30th. Since June 1st, this has increased to around 200. Fifty enemy aircraft attacked southern Kyushu, indicating that the enemy's base strength has been developed to a considerable extent. The enemy army has suffered significant damage before launching fierce attacks on the Japanese army, but they have still landed a large number of troops on Okinawa and continue to replenish supplies. Approximately eight to ten enemy divisions have landed. To sustain this massive force, their supplies must also increase, so the Japanese special attacks have a significant impact on the enemy.</p>
<p>Southwest Area Base, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - The land battles on Okinawa Island continue to unfold as fierce offensive and defensive engagements in the cities of Shuri and Naha. The enemy is gradually closing in on Japanese positions, attempting to break through. Part of Shuri City has been breached by the enemy. The Japanese army is launching a counterattack, engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat. Enemy troops in the area are dropping supplies from the air to alleviate supply difficulties.</p>
<p>Southwest Islands Base, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - The weather around Okinawa Island has been poor recently, so aerial operations by both Japanese and American forces have not been active. The activity of enemy aircraft has been as follows: only 70 aircraft attacked Okinawa Island on the 1st, and only 200 aircraft attacked the entire island chain. It appears that the enemy's strength at the airfields in northern and central Okinawa has been gradually increasing.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Launches Fierce Counterattack on the Banks of the Hsitang River in Burma; Night Bombers Support Operations</h3>
<p>Burma Front Base, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - The enemy attempted to forcibly cross [the river]. Three fires were seen, inflicting considerable damage on other enemy troops. All Japanese aircraft returned safely.</p>
<p>Japanese Army War Results on Tarakan Island</p>
<p>Southwest Pacific Base, 1st (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese air force attacked enemy military facilities and enemy positions in Tarakan on the nights of the 26th, 28th, and 29th, inflicting heavy damage. The Japanese army has steadfastly defended its positions against the overwhelming material strength of the enemy's offensive for more than three weeks, continuing its valiant efforts. The morale of the garrison on the island is rising, and in coordination with the Japanese air force's attacks, they are repeatedly launching fierce hand-to-hand attacks, achieving significant results.</p>
<h3>Scene of a Japanese Airborne Unit's Surprise Attack</h3>
<p>Zurich, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a dispatch from Paris, a "correspondent" on Okinawa reported on May 26th, describing the tragic scene of a Japanese airborne unit forcibly landing at an enemy airfield. On the night of the 25th, a Japanese airborne unit suddenly and forcibly landed at an American airfield on Okinawa. At the time, hundreds of American aircraft were parked at the airfield. Japanese airborne troops from Japanese twin-engine bombers rushed into the midst of them. According to the base commander, Lieutenant Colonel Smith's estimation, each Japanese aircraft carried twelve to fifteen soldiers, who carried hand grenades, bombs, and several days' worth of food. As soon as the aircraft landed, the soldiers inside leaped out. An officer in the control tower immediately opened fire, killing a Japanese soldier near the tower, but he himself died from a bayonet wound to the chest. The Japanese air force, in coordination with this airborne unit, heavily bombed the American airfield that night, with the bombing lasting eight hours, the largest bombing since the start of the Okinawa operation.</p>
<h3>Air Raid on Osumi and Satsuma Peninsulas Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Fukuoka, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - More than 200 enemy carrier-based aircraft, divided into formations of ten to thirty aircraft, guided by four airships, attacked Japanese air bases mainly on the Osumi Peninsula, northern Miyazaki Prefecture, Satsuma Peninsula, and southern Kumamoto Prefecture from 8:00 AM to 8:30 AM on the morning of the 2nd. They also strafed some trains with machine guns. They retreated from the sea around 8:30 AM. Japanese damage was minor.</p>
<h3>East Indies Independence Preparatory Committee Issues Closing Declaration, Resolves to Cooperate with Japan to Achieve Victory</h3>

<h3>Today is June 3rd - Hope the Nation Strictly Enforces the Ban on Opium</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - Today (3rd) is June 3rd, the Opium Suppression Day. Recalling one hundred years ago in 1839 AD, that is, the 19th year of Daoguang, our Governor-General of Guangdong and Guangxi, Lin Zexu, perceived the conspiracy of British and American imperialists to poison China. He resolutely burned over 20,000 boxes of opium belonging to British merchants at Humen, Guangdong. Afterwards, British imperialism used its guns to force us into war, which is the Opium War, a page of tragic history. For over a hundred years, opium was openly imported and freely sold and smoked, draining our finances and numbing our people, leading to the decline of the nation, which is deeply distressing to speak of. In the 24th year of the Republic [1935], our late Chairman Wang Jingwei, while in the Executive Yuan, followed the legacy of the Founding Father Sun Yat-sen to reject poison and promulgated a five-year ban on opium, which was vigorously promoted. Unfortunately, the August 13th Incident occurred soon after, leading to a relaxation. With the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, young people, seeing the difficulties of the time, launched the nationwide December 17th Movement to awaken the national populace and strive for strength. Until March of last year, the National Government reiterated its previous orders and decided to continue rigorously enforcing the ban on opium. A General Bureau for the Prohibition of Opium was specially established under the Ministry of the Interior, with the intention of specialized administration. Later, to further emphasize the promotion of the ban, it was transferred to the Military Affairs Commission. Although it has been over a year, the results obtained are not yet satisfactory. On this occasion of June 3rd, the Opium Suppression Day, we remember Lin Zexu's insightful foresight and deeply hope that the opium suppression authorities will implement it consistently, without the slightest negligence. We further hope that the national populace will awaken from now on and no longer sell or smoke, harming their own lives.</p>
<p>Wuhu, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - With the Opium Suppression Day approaching, the county's youth group department, in order to awaken the public's awareness of this meaningful anniversary, has scheduled a commemorative ceremony at the Youth Center at 9 AM on the morning of the 3rd. All middle and primary school group departments will participate at that time.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Province Actively Promotes Afforestation</h3>
<p>Hangzhou, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Zhejiang Provincial Agricultural Promotion Committee, seeing that most forests have been cut down, plans to promote afforestation universally starting this year and plans to set afforestation performance as a criterion for evaluating county magistrates. In addition, the provincial seedling farm will dispatch personnel to guide afforestation methods in various counties at any time. As for the seedlings needed in various places, in addition to the seedling farm doing its best to provide them, for the remaining amount, it is planned to request allocation from the Ministry of Industry. In the future, all barren mountains in the province will be turned into green forests, so that the province will not lack timber in the future.</p>
<p>The Weather is Suitable for the New Cocoons to Appear - Hangzhou, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - In the rural areas of various counties in Zhejiang Province, the silkworm rearing this spring has been favored by suitable sunny weather, and the silkworms have developed well with very few diseases. They have already spun their cocoons, and recently the new cocoons have appeared. Local cocoon purchasing merchants have already begun to collect them. The cocoon prices are all in accordance with the limited allocation of the Zhejiang Provincial Sericulture Commission, so the number of harvests in the future will be difficult to be abundant.</p>
<p>Various Counties Launch Rice Stem Borer Extermination Work - Hangzhou, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Zhejiang Provincial Agricultural Promotion Committee recently received a notice from the central authorities that rice stem borer pests have been discovered in Jiangning County and Longtan villages in Jiangsu Province, hoping to quickly launch a rice stem borer extermination campaign to maintain agricultural production. After receiving the order, the committee has notified agricultural organizations in various counties to actively launch rice stem borer extermination work to prevent any contingency. It is now planned to send personnel to inspect various counties in order to supervise them on the ground.</p>

<h3>A Complete Picture of Shenjiang County (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Yu Kun</p>
<p>Land and Water Transportation</p>
<p>Shenjiang County is located in the eastern coastal area, at the confluence of the Huangpu River and the Wusong River into the sea, thirty-five li from Wusong, converging with the Yellow Sea. It borders Fengxian to the south, with the Huangpu River as the dividing line, adjoins Songjiang County to the west, and is adjacent to Shanghai City to the north. The terrain is flat, with no strategic advantages to speak of, only the crisscrossing of rivers and harbors, with the Huangpu River and Hengjing as the main arteries. The Huangpu River flows through the southeastern boundary, and Hengjing runs north through Huazhuang, connecting to Jiading; in addition, Liuleitang, Guantang, and Yutang are all tributaries of the Huangpu River, but Yutang is now silted up and impassable. Furthermore, Zhugangtang and Shagangtang run parallel to Hengjing.</p>
<p>The county's transportation has always been convenient. On land, there is the Shanghai-Minhang Highway, from Shanghai City to Minhang Town within the county, with a total length of sixty-four li. It has fallen into disrepair after the war, and the road surface is quite damaged, causing difficulties for vehicles. Cars take about an hour or so to travel. Currently, there are three companies operating on this route, as far as the reporter knows: one is the Huazhong Long-Distance Bus, with its business office located on Lujiaxiang Road in the Nanshi district of Shanghai, selling tickets for the following routes and operating stations on the Shanghai-Minhang line, passing through Xietu Road, Wujiaxiang, Qianliangmiao, Qiaotou, and Beiqiao from Nanshi to Minhang. The fare from Nanshi to Minhang is 6,500 yuan, from Xietu Road to Minhang is 5,000 yuan, and the rest decreases by station. The departure times from Shanghai are 8:30 AM, 10:30 AM, 1:00 PM, and 2:30 PM, a total of four buses. The second is the Shanghai-Minhang Automobile Company, with its business office on Xietu Road in the Nanshi district, purely using small cars. The fare is 4,400 yuan per person, regardless of distance. Each car can carry six to seven people, and it departs when it is full. The time is not fixed. The third is the Zhonghua Automobile Transportation Company, with its business office located in Lu Road, north of Hubei Road. It also uses small cars, with a fare of 7,000 yuan per person and 45,000 yuan to charter the entire car. Each car can carry seven people. The time is not fixed. It is heard that prices will increase soon.</p>
<p>Water transport is due to bordering the Huangpu River. Before the war, there were countless ferries and weaving ships. Currently, only the Huazhong Inland River Shipping operates, with small ships running on a scheduled basis every day, connecting to Pinghu, Shanghai, and other places. The departure time from Shanghai is 8:00 AM every morning. The boat ticket is 4,000 yuan per person, and it takes four hours to reach Minhang Town. There are also rowing boats for crossing the river, traveling back and forth in the Huangpu River, connecting passengers from Minhang to Caocaojing in Nanhui. If the number of scheduled boats increases in the future, transportation will be even smoother.</p>
<p>Security is the Best</p>
<p>The security of this county is very stable, ranking first among the seven counties in the Shanghai city area (Jiading, Kunshan, Chongming, Shenjiang, Chuansha, Nanhui, Fengxian). There are no communist troops hiding within the territory, and the people appear to be living peacefully. Currently, the Shanghai-Minhang Highway is the boundary. Security teams are stationed to the west of the road, and central tax police are stationed to the east. Along the river and in various district towns, there are also Japanese security forces and police assisting. All members of the troops are rigorously trained and equipped with fine equipment. Furthermore, due to the effective supervision of the commanding officers in the stationed areas, military discipline is solemn, and extortion and other illegal behaviors are rarely heard of. In addition, self-defense corps have been organized in various districts. The corps members have been selected and rigorously trained. Therefore, local bandits and thieves are terrified, and criminal cases have also decreased as a result. Recently, a company of security teams has been practicing diligently outside Minhang Town. Every morning and evening, you can hear them singing military songs and slogans loudly, full of spirit. This painting is definitely not comparable to ordinary military troops.</p>
<p>Farmland and Products; The Soil is Fertile in Mu County</p>
<p>The county's land is fertile, suitable for extreme values, especially along the Pujiang area, with occasional sandy soil, most suitable for planting cotton. The county has approximately 200,000 mu of farmland, with a population of only over 80,000 people. All farmland is first-class superior fertile land, with very little wasteland. Because the land is flat, there are fewer forests, so the price per mu is very expensive. Before the war, the average was around 100 yuan per mu, but now the value is only six dan of rice.</p>
<p>Agriculture in Mu County is dominated by cotton, with a ratio of seven cotton to three rice in the farmland. Approximately one-third of the farmers own their own land, and approximately two-thirds rent land. Since the price of food has soared, the number of those growing grain has increased by three-tenths compared to the past, and the cotton market has changed color. Under the unified political orders of Jiangsu Province, the land tax has been collected since last year. The land tax is stipulated at one dou per mu, collected in two installments, three sheng for the first installment, and seven sheng for the second installment. The land rent is six dou of rice per mu, and forty jin of cotton per mu.</p>
<p>Rice is the main food for the people, but the total rice production of the county, when calculated with the population, is only enough to maintain the population for half a year. It is necessary to purchase rice from [blank] or other places to provide assistance. Therefore, the source of rice all depends on Songjiang, Jinshan, and other places. If the source is cut off, panic will arise. On the day the reporter arrived, the price of rice was only 150,000 yuan. Affected by the Shanghai rice price (185,000), and because Songjiang in the west happened to be within the military rice period, it was difficult to ship out, leading to a gradual increase in the local rice price.</p>
<p>Natural products depend on the suitability of the soil. Now I will describe the general essentials. Types of grains: there are many types of rice, there are two types of wheat, large and small. Buckwheat grains resemble black morning glory seeds. There are two types of beans, yellow and white. After the wheat harvest, they are planted half and half with sesame. Other crops such as millet, mung beans, red beans, broad beans, peas, etc. are all intercropped, and lentils are planted in hedges. Types of vegetables: such as lettuce, loofah are recently widely planted, yam, yellow yam, taro are produced near the Pujiang River in the west of the county. There are many citrus fruits; feathers, [blank], shellfish, and livestock are occasionally available.</p>
<p>Customs and Livelihood; Most of the Local Residents are Farmers</p>
<p>Most of the local residents are engaged in agriculture. The people admire simplicity and frugality and do not have the frivolous habits of Shanghai City. Their clothing, food, and shelter are extremely frugal. Most of their clothes are made of native cloth, but the upper middle class occasionally uses silk. Recently, customs have changed drastically, and the clothing of men and women has gradually become novel, and the habits of smoking and gambling are more prevalent, with more people becoming lazy every day. There are about two or three semi-public selling and smoking places in Minhang Town. The general teahouses sell tea in name, but in reality, they are gathering for gambling. In recent years, it is not uncommon to see good young people in the countryside ruin their families by entering those dens. After the incident, divorce and contract termination cases have also been heard of. People who are illiterate like to [blank] ghost stories and gods. When they encounter illness, they always perform rituals first and then seek medical treatment, sparing no expense. Marriages and funerals all follow astrology. In short, customs are deteriorating day by day, which is a misfortune for society. It is hoped that the authorities will find ways to ban it and actively reform it, which is the blessing of the nation and the local area. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>War Crimes Investigation Committee Meets in London</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to the London Gazette, the US representative Jackson, who attended yesterday's meeting of the War Crimes Investigation Committee in London, suggested establishing a "Central War Crimes Record Department" to concentrate war crimes reports collected by various countries. This would eliminate the war crimes investigation departments currently organized separately by sixteen countries, and the military communications department established in the United Nations Command Headquarters, because that organization can only engage in independent investigations, reconnaissance, and recording evidence, and cannot contact or exchange reports with each other.</p>

<h3>Politics and Heretical Sects</h3>
<p>— Wu Zhongxing</p>
<p>"Knowing why the world is in such a state of extreme decline, one should reflect and try to save it."</p>
<p>"Today, our duty is to save the people from suffering and create a lasting peace for all generations." - Gu Tinglin</p>
<p>Lessons from Historical Facts</p>
<p>Today's countryside has reached a state of "leaning but not collapsing, breaching but not disintegrating." The recent widely publicized reckless actions of the Wuxi Xiantian Dao (Way of Former Heaven) may be a precursor to the countryside "leaning and about to collapse, breaching and about to disintegrate." We cannot help but sigh at the "degradation of people's hearts" and worry about the peasants "taking risks." The current urgent task is not only to treat the symptoms but, more importantly, to address the root causes; not only to prescribe the right medicine but also to correct the origins and purify the source.</p>
<p>Recalling Chinese history, the practice of burning incense, gathering followers, and collecting rice as contributions to religious sects has a long history. The rebellions led by Zhang Lu and Zhang Jiao of the Han Dynasty, Sun En and Lu Xun of the Jin Dynasty, the Rice Thieves of Sichuan during the Six Dynasties and the Tang Dynasty, Nong Zhigao of the Song Dynasty, Liu Liu, Liu Qi, Zhao Fengzi, Xu Hongru, Tang Sai'er of the Ming Dynasty, and the White Lotus Sect and the Heavenly Reason Sect of the Qing Dynasty were all religious-based rebellions that arose during times of moral decay and were closely related to corrupt politics. While we do not need to overestimate the Xiantian Dao, we cannot ignore the lessons of historical facts.</p>
<p>Taking the well-known White Lotus Sect as an example, it rebelled for nine years, spreading across five provinces. Starting in the first month of the first year of the Jiaqing reign of the Qing Dynasty in Zhijiang and Yidu counties in Hubei Province, it disturbed several provinces, including Henan, Shaanxi, Sichuan, and Gansu, burning every village and town it entered, causing the first major chaos in the mid-Qing Dynasty. This is an undeniable historical fact. A faithful analysis of the reasons at the time reveals the following points:</p>
<p>1.  The corruption of local officials. After the death of Emperor Qianlong of the Qing Dynasty, the crimes of the powerful minister He Kun were exposed. For more than 20 years, he abused his power, engaged in extravagance, engaged in illegal private activities, harmed the country and the people, was greedy for money, and sought bribes, which planted the seeds of civil unrest. Because the local officials had someone above them who favored such behavior, they intensified their actions, leading to "excessive taxes and levies, shifting new debts to cover old ones, and the common people suffering from oppression with no one to care for them."</p>
<p>2.  The latent revolutionary ideas. During the heyday of the Qing Dynasty, although the people had ideas of restoring the Ming Dynasty, they had no way to act. At this time, there was the saying of "Supporting and protecting Niu Ba (牛八)," Niu Ba being a hidden mark for the character "Zhu (朱)," and there was also the saying of "The King of Ming is born," which showed nostalgia for the Ming Dynasty. Some people inevitably manipulated and used these sentiments during the civil unrest.</p>
<p>3.  The incitement of Buddhist legends. At that time, there was the so-called "Three Religions Should Transmit Complete Books (三敎應劫總觀通書)" which claimed that Dipankara Buddha, Sakyamuni Buddha, and Maitreya Buddha were the three kalpas, and used the rebirth of Maitreya Buddha as a slogan. As a result, peasants who were suffering from life were thus confused and recklessly rebelled.</p>
<p>As for the reasons why this kind of upheaval could continue to expand, there are only two points:</p>
<p>1.  The exacerbation by clerks and runners. When the upheaval first started, it was easy to suppress, but the clerks and runners took the opportunity to extort, "not asking whether they practiced the religion or not, only caring whether they paid money or not," thus deepening the peasants' resentment, leading to exacerbation.</p>
<p>2.  The increase in coerced followers. After the upheaval, peasants whose homes were destroyed and property exhausted had no choice but to be coerced into following. As a result, as time went on, more and more people who had no property or food attached themselves to the movement.</p>
<p>In short, the essence of "heretical disturbances," as Mei Zengliang argued: "In the world, there are rebellious people, treacherous people, poisonous officials, who are forced by hunger and cold to raise their blades and rise up, seeking parties and associates to join them in self-preservation. These rebellious people invite the ignorant and old, and call it a religion, which is what treacherous people do... Moreover, the name of religion is not easily accepted by the people from their superiors, but a commoner can obtain it in their hometown, which is not something that the people can do, it is the situation." Therefore, whether we are examining the White Lotus Sect or other disturbances in history, or even today's Xiantian Dao, we must not only pay attention to the evolution of the phenomenon, but most importantly, we must pay attention to the reasons for the formation of the "situation," and we must make plans for "prevention" and "exploiting the situation."</p>
<p>Analysis of Today's Situation</p>
<p>The history of the Xiantian Dao's spread in Jiangnan is still very short, starting in April of the 32nd year of the Republic of China (1943), only two years ago. The disturbances are currently limited to a small part of the countryside of Wuxi and its surrounding counties. Compared with the White Lotus Sect Rebellion and other disturbances, it can be said that it is still in its early stages. Although the "situation" is gradually brewing, we can still "exploit the situation" to gradually quell it.</p>
<p>However, we should pay attention to analyzing the reasons for the current "leaning but not collapsing, breaching but not disintegrating" state of the countryside. Now, while describing the development of the Xiantian Dao, we will point out the root causes of how heretical sects combine with corrupt politics.</p>
<p>1.  The oppression by miscellaneous troops in the countryside. The reason why the leader of a certain group requested the Xiantian Dao to come to Wuxi from North China to spread the teachings was because he suffered from the extortion of the guerrilla teams constantly moving within the borders of Cheng, Xi, and Wu counties, and was in great pain. He then went to Beijing, passed the president of the Xiantian Dao headquarters, and mistakenly believed that the Xiantian Dao was the only way to overcome the rural crisis. Later, the followers of the Xiantian Dao constantly fought against the local resident miscellaneous troops, also because they could not bear the oppression and their resentment filled their hearts.</p>
<p>2.  The influence of Buddhist thought. The Xiantian Dao is also called the "Buddha Power Protection Association," which is very similar to the White Lotus Sect's advocacy of the Maitreya Buddha's rebirth. Because after suffering from heavy oppression, the peasants believe that the only thing they can rely on to be saved is the power of the Buddha. This is the reason why they utilize the inherent beliefs of the people to gain a large number of followers. They even believe in the superstition that after worshiping in front of the incense hall, they can be invulnerable to swords and weapons, which also stems from this point.</p>
<p>3.  The heavy burden of exorbitant taxes and levies. The followers of the Xiantian Dao have repeatedly gathered crowds to attack rural towns' public offices or tax offices, which is due to the fact that the heads of rural towns are not able to win the people's support, and the tax collectors have accumulated resentment from the peasants. The peasants have exceeded the limit of silent endurance of misfortune and have taken extra-legal actions, which is also a common fact in historical upheavals.</p>
<p>4.  Resentment towards those who exploit the collection of rice and grain to extort and do evil. The peasants are not uncooperative with the collection of rice and grain. Firstly, they resent the poor attitude of those who buy the rice and grain, and secondly, they are indignant because they know that the buyers are engaging in corruption. Therefore, when someone raises the flag, hundreds of people respond. The problem with the purchase of rice and grain is not in principle, but in the organization. Today, the peasants are trapped in the tragic situation of "planting two acres of land and sleeping with their heads resting on the yamen," so they also attack the offices responsible for buying rice and grain.</p>
<p>In short, the peasants' belief is not in the theory or organization of the Xiantian Dao, but in rural self-defense. Rural self-defense is their goal, and the Xiantian Dao is merely their means, or rather, a weapon among their lack of options. The reasons why the peasants cause reckless actions can be summarized as, first, the problem of people's livelihood, and second, the problem of education. Because education is not widespread, people's hearts are "fragile," and because people's livelihood is difficult, they "take risks." We believe that to quell the reckless actions of the Xiantian Dao, it is not necessary to suppress them with military force, nor is it necessary to use tricks to appease them. The main thing is to "prescribe the right medicine" for these two points, and then receive the effect of "correcting the origins and purifying the source."</p>
<p>Fundamental Solutions for Moral Governance</p>
<p>During the White Lotus Sect Rebellion in the mid-Qing Dynasty, Hong Liangji's "Memorial on Suppressing Heretical Sects (征邪教疏)" was very famous. Although Hong Liangji was offended by this and exiled to Yili, Emperor Jiaqing praised it as "not despising Hong Liangji's words, carefully analyzing himself," and Hong Liangji's attitude was indeed standing on the position of worrying about the country and the people, and his plan was also aimed at "correcting the origins and purifying the source." Today, when we examine the Xiantian Dao, we can also bring it up for reference. Hong Liangji's method has three points:</p>
<p>First: Those who are coerced should be shown leniency. Hong Liangji, because he witnessed that the longer the White Lotus Sect Rebellion lasted, the more followers there were, strongly advocated the method of showing leniency to those who were coerced, and said: "Those who kill thousands of people or hundreds of people are just these unemployed vagrants, not true heretics, not true bandits, and there are tens of thousands of them in every prefecture and county. Can they all be killed? Even if they can all be killed, it is not what the benevolence of heaven can bear to do." His arguments are very insightful. The effect of showing leniency to those who are coerced, from the positive side, is to open the way for the foolish people to reform themselves, and from the negative side, it is to separate the followers of the heretical sects. The principle set by Jiangsu Province this time, "on the one hand, severely punishing the leaders of the Xiantian Dao, and on the other hand, advising the deceived people to wake up and know what to do," is indeed a plan to address the root causes.</p>
<p>Second: Officials should be incorruptible. Hong Liangji once discussed the clerks and runners of that time in his Essay on Intentions, believing that they "were enough to control the government from above, enough to bully and threaten the scholar-officials in the middle, and enough to fish and prey on the villages below." He also compared the clerks and runners to tigers and wolves: "The violence of the clerks is like that of tigers. Rather than having dozens or hundreds of tigers in a prefecture or county, it is better to reduce them even more. Today, in the larger prefectures and counties, there are as many as thousands of clerks and runners, followed by seven or eight hundred people, and at least one or two hundred people. These thousands of people to one or two hundred people do not farm when they are men, and do not weave when they are women, and they all rely on the people for food, without a doubt. Generally speaking, ten families of people are not enough to support one clerk, and if there are thousands of clerks, then a city of ten thousand families will also be noisy." His arguments are still relevant today. It is hoped that the authorities will reduce the number of rural technical agencies as much as possible, and strictly select the candidates for the heads of rural towns as much as possible. Anyone who embezzles grain, embezzles military rations, extorts, or takes bribes should be severely punished, so that "the grievances of the people can be relieved, and the mouths of the people can be blocked."</p>
<p>Third: Responsibilities should be assigned. Hong Liangji strongly emphasized the responsibility of those who are in charge of defending the territory, because the White Lotus Sect had spread to five provinces, so he advocated that they must be held specifically responsible. Although the scope of the Xiantian Dao is still small now, the heads of each county should also be held specifically responsible, so as to avoid the situation of "the bandits arrive and the soldiers are nowhere to be seen, and the soldiers come and the bandits disappear without a trace," which was the case during the White Lotus Sect Rebellion, because they were not specifically responsible for defending the territory. Although we do not advocate military conquest, the responsibility for defending the territory must be specifically assigned.</p>
<p>Secondly, the rice and grain purchasing mechanism must be improved, and the exorbitant taxes and levies must be eliminated. The improvement of the rice and grain purchasing mechanism, first, must not cause the peasants to directly feel pain, second, make as much use of the inherent traditional customs of various places as possible, which can be used flexibly, and third, respect the opinions of local gentry and peasants, and purchase at appropriate prices and in appropriate quantities. As for the advantages and disadvantages of exorbitant taxes and levies, they are very obvious, and most of them do not come from the authorities, but are cleverly established by various rural towns and villages, and extorted along the way. It is only necessary for the local authorities to strictly prohibit them, and the disadvantages can be eliminated, which will undoubtedly benefit the peasants.</p>
<p>In short, in today's countryside, when it is "leaning but not collapsing, breaching but not disintegrating," we should try our best to "exploit the situation," that is, even if the reckless actions have already begun, we can still immediately "prescribe the right medicine." Otherwise, as Mei Zengliang argued: "If the people are happy to do something, but we do not guide them to benefit, then in the countryside, there will inevitably be someone who, because of the people's desires, steals our intentions to sell their desires. At first, it is just a private name, wanting wealth, holding small competitions and gradually chasing them, and later it becomes the worry of those who govern the country. As for becoming the worry of those who govern the country, it is not only that those who follow and agree are not happy, but also that the initiators did not initially intend to do this. However, why is it that the situation must reach this point? I will explain it to guide them, I will gather them, and I can disperse them, so the power is on top; the people gather themselves, which is not allowed by the law, and the people know that the intention does not come from above, and they are afraid that the law will reach them, so they naturally have a heart to contend with the top, and their situation is gathered and cannot be dispersed, so it is said that it is not something that the people can do, it is the situation." Although this kind of situation is gradually brewing, we can still start early and diligently implement plans to address the root causes.</p>
<p>Although we do not want to overemphasize the Xiantian Dao, the crux of the matter is not in the phenomenon, but in the root, not in the heretical sect, but in the corrupt politics. To prevent the prairie fire of a single spark, we can only firmly advocate: eliminate corrupt politics, and then eradicate heretical sects. In today's society where the people are struggling to survive, we must not focus on the trivial and neglect the fundamental. We should quickly win back the hearts of the people, reform the institutions, and strive for good governance!</p>

<h3>Britain Makes New Proposals to Tito</h3>
<p>Seeking to Resolve Territorial Disputes</p>
<p>Zurich, 200th (Central News Agency) - The British military is eager to resolve the Trieste issue and intends to make new proposals to Tito. The Exchange Telegraph Agency's Rome telegram stated that the Allied Commander-in-Chief in the Mediterranean, Alexander, is scheduled to meet with Tito in Belgrade on June 2nd to resolve the Trieste dispute. At that time, if the Yugoslav army guarantees the safety of the transportation lines, the British side will express its intention to withdraw its troops from the eastern part of the Istrian Peninsula. However, in order to maintain the Austrian garrison, the British army cannot abandon Trieste, and is eager to establish an Anglo-American military government in the Trieste and Gorizia regions, so Tito may not simply accept Alexander's reconciliation.</p>
<h3>The Provincial Government of Jiangsu Orders a Crackdown on Uninspected Weights and Measures</h3>
<p>Suzhou, 2nd (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Weights and measures in rural counties and townships are sold at will without following the law, which is enough to disrupt the implementation of measurement administration. Therefore, the weighing and measurement inspection divisions of various counties have successively submitted requests to the provincial inspection office, which forwarded them to the provincial government, ordering various counties to instruct the village chiefs and ward heads to crack down on them in order to facilitate standardization. The provincial government has now issued an order to various counties to comply, requiring that all products be sent to the local competent authority for inspection before they can be sold.</p>
<h3>British Policy Towards India Determined; Governor-General Wavell Returns to His Post</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 2nd (Central News Agency) - Since Governor-General Wavell of India returned to his country on March 23rd, he has repeatedly discussed the Indian issue with Prime Minister Churchill, Attlee, and others. However, due to the end of the European War, the opening of the San Francisco Conference, and major changes in the international situation, the Indian issue could not be resolved satisfactorily. Recently, the British government's policy towards India has been decided, so Wavell returned to his post by air on the 1st of this month. The policy that has been decided has not yet been announced. Reuters recently commented on Wavell's return to his post, reporting that Wavell will use full authority to deal with all obstacles in India and guide the Indians to the right path.</p>

According to a political correspondent from Reuters, the political circles in London deeply believe that Wavell's visit to Britain must have been to study how to break the political deadlock in India and discuss how to obtain cooperation between the ruling Indian parties and leaders.</p>

<p>Chief Prosecutor Zhao Yantang of the Municipal Local Procuratorate was ordered to assume the post of Vice Minister of the Ministry of Justice. As he is about to leave Shanghai, he invited reporters yesterday to give a speech, saying: "Since I took office, although it has only been a little over a year, I have made every effort to reform all aspects of the office. For those who have committed minor crimes, I have tried my best to implement bail within the possible scope, thus reducing the overcrowding in the detention center. In the past, the Shanghai Judicial Police Force had an independent nature, and the drawbacks were inevitable. It was affiliated to the Local Procuratorate, and I concurrently served as the captain to command it. I am still satisfied with the results. After I leave Shanghai, the position of Chief Prosecutor will be filled by the Chief Prosecutor of our Office, Sun Jiajie. There will be no changes in all internal personnel matters."</p>
<h3>The Shipping Industry is Dispatched to Transport Rice and Grain</h3>
<p>According to news from the shipping industry yesterday, the industry was granted a special permit by the relevant authorities to dispatch several ships to various ports in northern Jiangsu on the previous two days to transport supplies because of the soaring food prices and the seriousness of the people's food problems in the city. It is reported that a large amount of rice, soybeans, and wheat will be shipped to Shanghai within days.</p>
<h3>The Rationing of China Tobacco is Decided to Change; All Retail Cigarette Stores are Abolished</h3>
<p>The rationing of China Tobacco, after being planned and changed by the authorities, now has a concrete plan determined. The retail cigarette stores in the city will be abolished from this month to actively reorganize them. At the same time, the monthly delivery period and quantity will also be re-regulated, which will be implemented once approved by the competent authorities.</p>
<h3>This Period's Household Flour to be Sold Starting on the 7th, One Catty per Certificate</h3>
<p>The Municipal Goods Rationing Office has been ordered to be abolished, and all rationing matters have been transferred to the Municipal Economic Bureau to handle. The Bureau, in view of the recent surge in rice prices and the threat to the people, in addition to actively planning to stabilize the rice market, and to alleviate the people's food panic, has prepared for the sale of this period's household flour, which will be sold starting next Thursday (June 7th) to the 12th of the same month. At that time, all households will be required to present the No. 47 Comprehensive Rationing Certificate to purchase one catty of flour from the designated merchants at a price of 400 yuan in national currency.</p>
<h3>The Recent Movement of Materials is Smooth</h3>
<p>The recent inflow and outflow of materials is still smooth. Although there are no statistics to compare the quantity of exported and imported materials from Central China, South China, North China, and Huaihai, according to news from the Material Movement Application Permit Office and the Shanghai Office of the Material Control Review Committee, recently, all applications for material movement permits and the joint review procedures have been faster than before. The period for the rejection or approval of documents and decisions is at most one week, and the fastest is only one or two days. In Shanghai, sacks and blue products are the most imported, followed by important materials from various places. The most exported goods to Central China, South China, and Huaihai are pigments, followed by daily necessities and major commodities. However, the insufficient supply of transportation vehicles has a great impact on the export and import of materials. It is hoped that the authorities will find a way to solve this matter as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Deferred Clearing of Negotiable Instruments: Impractical</h3>
<p>Regarding the proposal by the Chinese Bankers' Association and the Foreign Bankers' Association for deferred clearing of negotiable instruments, initially, its implementation was earnestly anticipated to alleviate financial difficulties. However, after deliberation by the Money Dealers' Association, it has been indicated that they cannot agree to it. It is understood that while banking peers generally support the idea, the dissent from the money dealers makes its implementation practically impossible. This is because there are extensive exchanges of negotiable instruments between banks and money shops. If banks implement deferred clearing independently while money shops continue same-day clearing, the obstacles will be even greater.</p>
<h3>Establishment of the Civil Air Defense Training Institute Alumni Association</h3>
