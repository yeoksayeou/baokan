<h3>馬尼刺展開　壯烈市街戰　日軍發揮鐵血眞姿態</h3>
<p>呂宋基地八日中央社電　急圖侵入馬尼刺之敵軍，茲特糾合菲律賓匪賊多數，目三日夜接近馬尼刺附近，斯時，日海軍陸戰隊與陸單部隊緊密協力下，於市街東方及北方，對之邀擊，速日展開壯烈之巷戰，同時，並確保車站及馬拉卡寗大總統官邸之線，刻正續與來襲之敵軍激戰中。敵軍屢次侵攻馬尼刺時，遍投燒夷彈，以圖焚毀民房，因此馬拉卡寗官邸及馬尼刺繁華街市，均被烈火包圍，頓呈凄慘景象，日精銳部隊，於此烈火中，仍堅守各據點激戰，而重創敵軍。一方，敵以一部份降落傘部隊及匪團，於五日下午目尼科拉斯飛機塲南方來襲，結果兩度均被南方地區之日軍部隊擊退。又是夕，日陸海軍共同組織之突擊隊，曾猛烈突擊敵戰車集團及步兵陣地，而使敵軍潰滅，又克拉克菲爾德地區之日海軍部隊與陸軍部隊協力，連夜對以馬尼刺爲目標急趨南下之敵主力側背，繼續壯烈之砲戰，且突擊各處，而充分發揮日鐵血陸戰隊之眞姿態，迄今爲止，判明已獲得炸毀敵戰車二十輛，裝甲車數輛及殺敵二千三百名之大戰果。</p>
<p>菲島前綫八日中央社電　呂宋島中部卡巴那辰附近之俘虜收容所內之英·美·荷·挪各國俘虜，共約五百十一名，一月三十日已陷入美國堂握中，彼等均爲殘廢不全者。</p>
<p>仁牙因敵損害極大</p>
<p>菲律賓前綫八日中央社電　仁牙因之敵，自分兩方，一自呂宋平原向北，一沿山向東迂迥以來，迭遭日軍之攻擊，受損奇鉅，各地之戰况如次：克拉克地區日軍，依然確保班班西方高地，與敵激戰，甚至使敵軍不能使用機塲，敵軍遭日軍準確之砲擊及第一線突擊隊之猛攻，已蒙極大損害。迄今之戰果，已擱淺燒毀其戰車三十一輛，裝甲車兩輛，破壞汽車三十五輛，砲五尊，迫擊砲二尊，其他機關槍，自動步槍等甚夥，鹵獲汽車六輛，機槍，重輕機槍十四架，砲二尊，敵遣棄屍體三千二百六十四具，敵之損失已達七千以上。姆尼奧斯之日軍，在敵軍重圍下，孤軍奮阻，仍確保陣地，四日以來，向集中之敵加以砲擊，將士士氣極盛，姆尼奧斯北方烏明幹及魯哈俄桑霍塞，目下遭優勢敵軍攻擊，五日擁有半數十五榴砲兵之敵十連，以砲來襲，至正午，敵大舉殺抵日軍第一線，曾一度被日軍擊退，下午二時，敵軍再度攻擊山麓地帶，已展開壯烈之血戰。又仁牙因灣正面之戰線無大變化，敵軍並連日猛襲巴岐俄山路險要康普安，但日軍陣地亳無動搖，將士連日突擊，已使敵不勝其苦，山砲隊至一月二十五所獲戰果，共計斃敵八四八人，其他擊沉大型上陸用舟艇二艘，迫擊砲一尊，幕舍三處，軍需品堆集處十數處，鹵獲機槍三支，彈藥多數。</p>
<h3>空襲常識談</h3>
<p>當此前綫戰事極度激烈的時候，敵機對於後方都市的轟炸，也日益頻繁，茲將日本飯田橋病院院畏竹村元祥醫學博士關於空襲常識的談話，節譯於后，以供防空工作者及一般市民的參考。</p>
<p>燒夷彈及滅火</p>
<p>美機所用的燒夷彈，由易燃易熄的油脂及難燃而持久的生橡膠混合製成。空襲漢堡時，美機投下的燒夷彈就是用舊汽車胎等碎片溶於二硫化炭中並和黃燐配合的物質裝塡的。此種燒夷彈在炸裂的時候，盡可能將已燃的生橡膠噴散，以期引起火災。至其弱點，則爲火焰頗弱，其瞬刻的最高溫度亦不到一千度，柱壁等木質東西，如果濡水，須費二十分鐘才能使之燃燒，有時且不待撲滅便自行熄滅。至於人員，只要穿上完全的防空服，縱然碰到此種燒夷彈的火焰，也不至於被火灼傷，這樣的例很多。此種燒夷彈落下時，消防活動的要諦即在阻其火焰四散，已著火之處，則設法將其燃燒物質拭去。滅火的適當步驟是：用水冷却瀟濕，隔絕氧氣，然後只用脚踏也可使它熄滅了。</p>
<p>炸彈及埋沒</p>
<p>空襲常識談</p>
<p>二百五十公斤級的炸彈投下後，視地質堅硬與吾，普通最低限度可噴起一百立方公尺砂土，造成深約五，六公尺，直徑約十二公尺的漏斗孔，其周圍約六公尺的範圍內，皆在「土壤震幅威力圈」丙。一百立方公尺砂土的重量，着實可觀，壓下來時，決不是輕易忍受得住的。再則，由炸彈爆發時所造成的土壤震幅，足使防空壕崩潰，因此在建築防空壕時，應設法鞏固其土壁，並盡量减少其深度與　度。</p>
<p>被炸彈掘起的砂土埋沒以後，立刻就死的人很少，一般死亡率之所以高，厥因發掘，救出及人工呼吸等工作尙多遺憾之點的緣故。因此，發掘用的工具等必須完備，而且在土質堅硬的塲合，更應集中挖掘一處，不可同時由數點發掘，以期儘速和內部通空氣。據實騐所知，一個人在一立方公尺空氣中，可以生存二至三小時。在這樣的塲合，新鮮空氣更此血液寳貴，所以在避難所內應絕對禁止吸烟或燃火等增多炭酸氣的舉動。</p>
<p>被救出來的人，如果尙有體溫，則應淸除其口鼻中的泥土，實行人工呼吸，切勿急切未見效果就罷手。總之，知道正確的人工呼吸法是要緊的。</p>
<p>火傷與外傷</p>
<p>空襲時的火傷，大多發生在顏面部，單戴鐵盔是無用的，所以切勿忘記保護顏面的頭巾，但防水用的覆面巾用來防火是無效的。至於婦女們遇到空襲時，最應當心頭髮起火。滿頭靑絲不幸着火以後，嚴重的火傷是難免的。</p>
<p>空襲時的創傷有四個特徵，即：（一）創傷種類不一；（二）多人同時受傷；（三）一人多創；（四）不潔。施行救護時須視其負傷情形如何而加以適當處理。</p>
<p>外傷與火傷相似，百分之五十以上發生於頭都，而此部分最有受到致命傷的危險，尤須注意。</p>
<p>敵機來襲時，從事防空的人負，除戴鐵盔以外，能够完善保護頭部及胸肩的頭巾，亦屬必要，此和預防火傷的情形相類。頭巾之厚如有三公分，即可抵擋秒速約五十米的高射砲彈破片。</p>
<p>總之，完全的防空服裝是可充分預防火傷及外傷的。（譯自一月五日朝日新聞）</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>敵美的空襲戰略</h3>
<p>由於呂宋島戰事的滯韌，敵美爲呼應作戰，乃加强其他地區的空中攻勢。屢次在台灣華南以至日本本土及華中若干大都市，敵美不斷實施連續空襲，實有很大的作用。</p>
<p>主要的，直接的軍事作用是企圖牽制盟邦的軍力，想藉此分散盟邦空軍力量，以爲盟鄰後方要地旣遭廣汎的空襲，遂不能不留置一部份空軍和防空工具作抵禦之用，因此可令減弱菲島的防衛力。然而事實上盟邦在各地防空力量，平均雄厚，防空措施也非常周密，是決不會影響到菲島戰事的。</p>
<p>其次，敵美的空襲戰略，又企圖破壞盟邦對菲島的增援和接濟，截阻菲島盟軍的給養。台灣遭受空襲之所以特別强烈，其一部份原因，也就是由於敵美認爲台灣是盟邦在菲島戰事中最重要的給養根據地。所以不僅空襲强烈，敵美並調遣機動部隊，在台灣南方巴士海峽及中國南海一帶活動，飛往台灣冲繩華南香港等地轟炸的敵機，多半就是這些機動部隊中的艦載機。可是，一方面由於盟邦神風特別攻擊隊的活躍，使敵機動部隊及敵機都無所施其技，另一方面由於盟邦護航部隊護航的得力，菲島盟軍的給養，也並不受了大影響。</p>
<p>敵美空襲手段之又一企圖是想破壞我們後方的生產。因此，于盟邦軍需工業生產地區，也較爲注意。敵美對于盟邦在最近幾年來飛躍地發展着的生產力量，尤其飛機生產的突飛猛晋，是極其妒嫉的，必欲破壞之而後己。但盟邦不僅有着英勇的防空戰士，且有堅毅的產業戰士，任何破壞都不能達其目的的。</p>
<p>另外，敵美更企圖利用空襲作神經戰，並紊亂我們後方的安寗。其主要目的無非想動搖我們後方的民心，從而影響前方作戰。實則大東亞各地絕大多數人民，早具殲滅英美侵略勢力的決心，任何神經性的攻勢，都難動搖他們的決心的。</p>
<p>對於敵美在妄的空襲戰略，軍事上盟邦的防空力量，自然可足以應付而無問題，但我們大家必須認識，敵機空襲戰略中的破壞後方民衆生活，與破壞前綫軍事戰力，同樣重要。當然我們對於敵機的空襲，原無所恐懼，而以鎭靜態度處之，但爲使敵美的空襲戰略，一無所獲，我們應對可能之空襲，預作萬全準備，俾可盡力協助盟邦作戰。如無留居上海必要者，應早作疏散之圖。抵制敵美不顧人道的空襲戰略，須全市民自動奮起。</p>

<h3>渝美空軍承認南雄機塲失陷</h3>
<p>里斯本八日中央社電　美聯社駐重慶特派員六日報稱：駐渝美空軍於放棄攙川基地之後，又目南雄贛州兩基地撤退，對此昆明之美軍第十四航空隊司令部，六月曾發表廿九日下午放棄南雄機塲之消息。按該部隊於南雄所保持之航空兵力之一部，其目的不外封鎖日軍第一線後方，且向日軍航空隊及船舶輸送挑戰，繼南雄放棄之後，於遂川南雄兩飛機塲殘餘之要員，本擬盡可能用贛州機塲，由空路撤退，但終於卅日實行放棄。</p>

<p>菲律賓前綫基地八日中央社電　菲律賓共和國於美軍未侵入馬尼刺之前，所有各機關均已遷移呂宋北部，洛勒爾大總統等各政府官吏，均全面協力日軍，以期擊滅敵美，擁護國家之獨立。</p>
<h3>雪蘭峨菲協會　會長發表談話</h3>
<p>夸刺隆普爾八日中央社電　駐該地之雪蘭峨州菲律賓協會會長特巴德氏，接獲美軍侵入馬尼刺消息後，異常激憤，特發表談話如次：僑居馬來地方之菲律賓人在日本軍政當局愛護下，安居樂業，菲律賓已得日本之支援，完成獨立大業，然美軍再度侵入樂園之菲律賓，旣非爲謀亞洲之解放，更非爲求菲律賓之幸福，實際爲達成其併吞之野心，故捲土重來。反之，日本爲整個亞洲之解放，今菲律賓已爲保衛日本之前衛而從事戰鬥，吾人對日軍此種祟高精神，衷心表示感謝，願國人共同奮起，防衛祖國。</p>
<h3>法蘭克福兩側　德守軍反攻　一部蘇軍進攻斯特丁</h3>
<p>柏林八日中央社電　德國社訊：據此間軍事當局發表，沃特河下游法蘭克福兩側之戰事，已進入極激烈之階段，但因蘇軍集中坦克車手續尙未齊備，故仍不能視爲决戰。蘇步兵攻於九十公里寬之陣綫上，而有摩托化砲隊爲之支援，敵擬於沃特河西岸法闌克福之兩側獲得立足點，但德軍立即反攻，將敵驅入冰冷之河水中，德砲隊則製擊敵砲位，而使其多數停止發彈，德空軍亦支援反攻甚力。庫斯特林（柏林之東）德守軍，擊退敵集中之攻勢，而迫使其採取守勢。蘇軍預備攻勢，集中實力頗大，其一部恐將由法蘭克福攻柏林，另一部則將攻斯特丁及奧得河河口，其攻斯特丁市者，業已開始行動。</p>
<p>柏林八日中央社電　海通社訊：東綫中段之戰事，以蘇軍企圖渡沃特河爲最要，該戰事焦點在布利格附近，最近兩日奧勞及布利格之蘇軍橋頭堡已見擴大，奧特勃魯許方面法蘭克福之南及庫斯特林附近，樹立兩小橋頭堡，蘇軍壓力，現在布利格區內，蘇軍向南拓展橋頭堡，蘇軍向格羅特高推進，蘇軍長官似具有進窺華爾登堡工業區之企圖。</p>

<h3>Japanese House of Representatives Plenary Session Passes Resolution on Decisive Battle Measures; Prime Minister Koiso Announces Immediate Implementation</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese House of Representatives unanimously passed a resolution to immediately implement decisive battle measures during its plenary session on the 7th. Prime Minister Koiso made a special request to speak and expressed his belief as follows: The immediate implementation of decisive battle measures has been understood. The reasons for the proposal have been explained at the Budget Committee meeting and will not be repeated here. However, I must add one recent word, that is, at this time when the situation is becoming increasingly urgent, the government firmly trusts the loyalty of the 100 million compatriots and actively and immediately implements decisive battle measures to achieve the objectives of the war.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency Telegram) - After the adjournment of the plenary session of the Japanese Imperial Rule Assistance Political Society on the 7th, a meeting of Diet members was held immediately within the Diet, where they mutually stated the parliamentary operations after the recess, unresolved opinions, and the abolition of the Assembly and Association Control Law, the formation of production army issues, etc. As a result, it was unanimously argued that the government should be requested to reopen the parliament when necessary before the end of the March session. Afterwards, a meeting of Diet members of goodwill was reopened to review issues such as the formation of production armies.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency Telegram) - More than 250 Diet members of goodwill in the Japanese House of Representatives believe in enhancing the winning war power, fully mobilizing the labor of the people and requisitioning important military industry enterprises, and creating a winning production army. The above opinions were passed by the plenary session on the 7th and submitted to the government. At the same time, in view of the current general situation that cannot be realized, a meeting of Diet members of goodwill was held again after the plenary session on this day. After discussion, it was decided to launch independent activities, not only within the Diet, but also to arouse the resonance of people from all walks of life throughout the country, and directly submit proposals to the government. As a result, the internal activities of the Imperial Rule Assistance Political Society continued, and it was decided to use various means to achieve the goal. Finally, more than ten people were elected as implementation committee members, and the meeting adjourned around 7 o'clock.</p>
<p>Closing of the House of Peers Regular Session</p>

In addition, the approval case for the reserve fund expenditure case will be submitted at the same time, so the general meeting of the House of Peers will end after the 15th. However, in fact, the plenary session on the 8th only had the settlement plan and after-the-fact approval case, and the 9th will be a recess state.</p>
<h3>Fierce Street Battles Unfold in Manila; Japanese Army Displays Iron-Blooded True Form</h3>
<p>Luzon Base, 8th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Enemy troops, attempting to rapidly invade Manila, have now assembled a large number of Philippine bandits and approached the vicinity of Manila on the night of the 3rd. At this time, the Japanese naval landing force and army units, in close cooperation, launched an ambush in the east and north of the city, quickly unfolding a fierce street battle. At the same time, the lines of the station and the Malacañang Presidential Palace were secured, and fierce fighting with the attacking enemy troops is continuing. When the enemy troops repeatedly invaded Manila, they threw incendiary bombs everywhere in an attempt to burn down civilian houses. As a result, the Malacañang Palace and the bustling streets of Manila were surrounded by raging fires, presenting a tragic scene. The elite Japanese troops, in this raging fire, still firmly defended their strongholds and engaged in fierce battles, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy troops. On the other hand, a portion of the enemy's parachute troops and bandit groups attacked the south of Nichols Airfield on the afternoon of the 5th. As a result, both attacks were repelled by the Japanese army units in the southern region. On the same evening, a commando team jointly organized by the Japanese army and navy fiercely attacked the enemy's tank group and infantry positions, causing the enemy troops to collapse. In addition, the Japanese naval and army units in the Clark Field area cooperated and continued a fierce artillery battle on the flanks and backs of the enemy's main force, which was rushing south toward Manila, fully demonstrating the true posture of the Japanese iron-blooded marine corps. To date, it has been confirmed that a great victory has been achieved, with 20 enemy tanks and several armored vehicles destroyed, and 2,300 enemy soldiers killed.</p>
<p>Philippine Front Line, 8th (Central News Agency Telegram) - A total of approximately 511 British, American, Dutch, and Norwegian prisoners of war in the prisoner-of-war camp near Cabanatuan in central Luzon Island fell into the hands of the United States on January 30. They are all disabled and incomplete.</p>
<p>Great Damage to the Enemy at Lingayen</p>
<p>Philippine Front Line, 8th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The enemy at Lingayen, divided into two groups, one advancing north along the Luzon Plain and the other detouring east along the mountains, has been repeatedly attacked by the Japanese army and suffered enormous losses. The battle situation in various locations is as follows: The Japanese army in the Clark area still secures the high ground west of Bamban and engages in fierce battles with the enemy, even preventing the enemy from using the airfield. The enemy troops have suffered great damage from the accurate shelling and fierce attacks of the Japanese army's first-line assault teams. To date, the battle results have included 31 tanks aground and burned, 2 armored vehicles, 35 vehicles destroyed, 5 artillery pieces, 2 mortars, and many other machine guns and automatic rifles. Six vehicles, machine guns, 14 heavy and light machine guns, and two artillery pieces were captured. 3,264 enemy corpses were abandoned, and the enemy's losses have reached more than 7,000. The Japanese army at Muñoz, besieged by the enemy, resisted alone and still secured the position. Since the 4th, they have shelled the concentrated enemy, and the morale of the soldiers is extremely high. Umingan and Lohaos-San Jose, north of Muñoz, are currently under attack by superior enemy forces. On the 5th, the enemy's ten-company, which possessed half of the 150mm howitzers, attacked with artillery. Until noon, the enemy launched a large-scale attack on the Japanese army's first line and was once repelled by the Japanese army. At 2 pm, the enemy army attacked the foothills again, and a fierce bloody battle has unfolded. In addition, the front line on the front of Lingayen Bay has not changed much. The enemy army has also been fiercely attacking the Kampooan, a key point on the Baguio mountain road, but the Japanese army's position has not been shaken. The soldiers have been launching assaults for days, making life unbearable for the enemy. The battle results achieved by the mountain artillery team up to January 25 totaled 848 enemy soldiers killed. Other results included sinking two large landing craft, destroying one mortar, three barrack sites, and dozens of military supply accumulation sites, and capturing three machine guns and many ammunition.</p>
<h3>Common Sense about Air Raids</h3>
<p>At a time when the frontline battles are extremely fierce, enemy aircraft are also bombing rear cities with increasing frequency. The following is an abridged translation of a conversation on common sense about air raids by Dr. Motoyoshi Takemura, director of Iidabashi Hospital in Japan, for the reference of air defense workers and the general public.</p>
<p>Incendiary Bombs and Fire Extinguishing</p>
<p>The incendiary bombs used by American aircraft are made of a mixture of flammable and easy-to-extinguish grease and non-flammable and durable raw rubber. During the air raid on Hamburg, the incendiary bombs dropped by American aircraft were filled with substances made by dissolving fragments of old car tires and the like in carbon disulfide and combining them with yellow phosphorus. When this type of incendiary bomb explodes, it spreads the burning raw rubber as much as possible in order to cause a fire. As for its weakness, the flame is quite weak, and its instantaneous maximum temperature is less than 1,000 degrees. Wooden things such as pillars, if wetted with water, will take 20 minutes to burn, and sometimes they will extinguish themselves without being extinguished. As for personnel, as long as they wear complete air raid clothing, even if they encounter the flames of this type of incendiary bomb, they will not be burned. There are many such examples. When this type of incendiary bomb falls, the key to fire-fighting activities is to prevent the flames from spreading. Where a fire has already started, try to wipe off the burning material. The appropriate steps for extinguishing a fire are: cool with water, isolate oxygen, and then it can be extinguished simply by stepping on it with your feet.</p>
<p>Bombs and Burial</p>
<p>Common Sense about Air Raids</p>
<p>After a 250-kilogram bomb is dropped, depending on the hardness of the soil, it can usually spray up a minimum of 100 cubic meters of sand and soil, creating a funnel hole approximately five or six meters deep and approximately twelve meters in diameter. The area within a radius of approximately six meters around it is within the "soil vibration power circle." The weight of 100 cubic meters of sand and soil is considerable, and it is by no means easy to endure when it presses down. Furthermore, the soil vibration caused by the explosion of the bomb is enough to cause the air raid shelter to collapse. Therefore, when building an air raid shelter, efforts should be made to consolidate its earth walls and minimize its depth and width.</p>
<p>Few people die immediately after being buried by the sand and soil excavated by the bomb. The reason why the general mortality rate is high is because there are still many regrets in the work of excavation, rescue, and artificial respiration. Therefore, tools for excavation must be complete, and in the case of hard soil, excavation should be concentrated in one place, and excavation should not be carried out from several points at the same time, in order to quickly connect with the air inside. According to known experiments, one person can survive in one cubic meter of air for two to three hours. In such a case, fresh air is more precious than blood, so smoking or burning fire, which increases carbonic acid gas, should be absolutely prohibited in the shelter.</p>
<p>If the person who is rescued still has body temperature, the mud in their mouth and nose should be removed and artificial respiration should be performed. Do not give up hastily if you do not see results. In short, it is important to know the correct artificial respiration method.</p>
<p>Burns and External Injuries</p>
<p>Most burns during air raids occur on the face. Simply wearing a helmet is useless, so do not forget to protect your face with a headscarf. However, a waterproof face covering is ineffective for preventing fire. As for women, they should be most careful about their hair catching fire during an air raid. If a head of black hair is unfortunately on fire, severe burns are inevitable.</p>
<p>There are four characteristics of injuries during air raids, namely: (1) the types of injuries vary; (2) many people are injured at the same time; (3) one person has multiple injuries; (4) it is unclean. When providing rescue, appropriate treatment must be given depending on the nature of the injury.</p>
<p>Similar to burns, more than 50% of external injuries occur to the head, and this part is most likely to suffer fatal injuries, so special attention must be paid.</p>
<p>When enemy aircraft attack, it is also necessary for those engaged in air defense, in addition to wearing helmets, to have a headscarf that can completely protect the head and chest. This is similar to the case of preventing burns. If the thickness of the headscarf is three centimeters, it can withstand fragments from anti-aircraft shells with a speed of approximately 50 meters per second.</p>
<p>In short, complete air raid clothing can fully prevent burns and external injuries. (Translated from the Asahi Shimbun, January 5)</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Enemy's Air Raid Strategy</h3>
<p>Due to the tenacious nature of the battle on Luzon Island, the enemy is intensifying its aerial offensive in other areas in order to respond to the operation. The enemy has repeatedly carried out continuous air raids in Taiwan, South China, and even mainland Japan and some major cities in Central China, which has had a significant impact.</p>
<p>The main, direct military purpose is to attempt to contain the military strength of the Allied Nations, and to disperse the Allied air force in order to leave a part of the air force and air defense equipment to defend key rear areas of the Allied Nations, which have been subjected to extensive air raids, thereby weakening the defense force of the Philippines. However, in fact, the air defense forces of the Allied Nations are strong and well-equipped everywhere, and the air defense measures are very thorough, so it will definitely not affect the battle in the Philippines.</p>
<p>Secondly, the enemy's air raid strategy also attempts to disrupt the Allied Nations' reinforcements and supplies to the Philippines, and to intercept the supplies for the Allied forces in the Philippines. The reason why Taiwan has been subjected to particularly strong air raids is partly because the enemy believes that Taiwan is the most important supply base for the Allied Nations in the battle in the Philippines. Therefore, not only are the air raids strong, but the enemy has also dispatched mobile units to operate in the Bashi Channel south of Taiwan and the South China Sea. Most of the enemy aircraft flying to Taiwan, Okinawa, South China, Hong Kong, and other places for bombing are carrier-based aircraft from these mobile units. However, on the one hand, due to the activity of the Allied Nations' Kamikaze Special Attack Corps, the enemy's mobile units and enemy aircraft are unable to use their skills. On the other hand, due to the effectiveness of the escort by the Allied Nations' escort units, the supplies to the Allied forces in the Philippines have not been greatly affected.</p>
<p>Another attempt of the enemy's air raid tactics is to destroy our rear production. Therefore, more attention has been paid to the Allied Nations' military industry production areas. The enemy is extremely jealous of the Allied Nations' rapidly developing production power in recent years, especially the rapid progress in aircraft production, and must destroy it. However, the Allied Nations not only have heroic air defense soldiers, but also determined industrial soldiers, and no destruction can achieve its purpose.</p>
<p>In addition, the enemy is also attempting to use air raids as a nerve war and disrupt the peace and stability of our rear. The main purpose is nothing more than to shake the morale of our people in the rear, thereby affecting the frontline operations. In fact, the vast majority of people in various parts of the Greater East Asia have long had the determination to annihilate the British and American aggressive forces, and no nervous offensive can shake their determination.</p>
<p>Regarding the enemy's wishful air raid strategy, the Allied Nations' air defense forces can naturally cope with it militarily without any problems, but we must all recognize that the destruction of the people's lives in the rear and the destruction of the military strength of the front line are equally important in the enemy aircraft's air raid strategy. Of course, we have no fear of enemy air raids and deal with them calmly, but in order to ensure that the enemy's air raid strategy achieves nothing, we should make full preparations for possible air raids so that we can do our best to assist the Allied Nations in the war. Those who do not need to stay in Shanghai should make plans for evacuation as soon as possible. To resist the enemy's inhumane air raid strategy, all citizens must rise up spontaneously.</p>

The Philippines, with the support of Japan, has completed the great task of independence. However, the U.S. military's re-invasion of the paradise that is the Philippines is neither for the sake of Asia's liberation nor for the happiness of the Philippines, but actually to fulfill its ambition of annexation, hence its return. Conversely, Japan is for the liberation of the entire Asia. Now the Philippines is fighting to defend Japan as its vanguard. We express our heartfelt gratitude for this noble spirit of the Japanese army, and we wish that our countrymen will rise up together to defend the motherland.</p>
<h3>German Defense Forces Counterattack on Both Sides of Frankfurt; Part of the Soviet Army Attacks Stettin</h3>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) - A German news agency dispatch: According to an announcement by local military authorities, the fighting on both sides of Frankfurt, downstream of the Warta River, has entered an extremely fierce stage, but because the Soviet army has not yet completed the concentration of its tanks, it cannot be considered a decisive battle. Soviet infantry are attacking on a ninety-kilometer-wide front, supported by motorized artillery. The enemy intends to gain a foothold on both sides of Frankfurt on the west bank of the Warta River, but the German army immediately counterattacked, driving the enemy into the icy river. German artillery suppressed enemy artillery positions, causing most of them to cease firing, and the German air force also strongly supported the counterattack. The German defense forces in Kustrin (east of Berlin) repelled a concentrated enemy offensive, forcing them to adopt a defensive posture. The Soviet army is preparing a large-scale offensive, and a part of it may attack Berlin from Frankfurt, while another part will attack Stettin and the mouth of the Oder River. The attack on the city of Stettin has already begun.</p>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) - A Reuters dispatch: The most important part of the fighting in the central sector of the Eastern Front is the Soviet army's attempt to cross the Warta River.

Two small bridgeheads have been established in the direction of Ottoburg, south of Frankfurt, and near Kustrin. The Soviet pressure is now within the Brieg area, and the Soviet army is expanding the bridgehead to the south, advancing towards Grottkau.

<h3>Central Reserve Bank to Issue 1000 Yuan Notes; Finance Minister Zhou Issues Statement</h3>
<p>In order to alleviate the difficulty of a shortage of cash in the market and eliminate the manipulation of unscrupulous merchants, the National Government has specially approved the issuance of 1000 yuan notes by the Central Reserve Bank to stabilize the financial situation. Finance Minister Zhou issued a statement yesterday: For several months, the cash flow in the market has been insufficient, and merchants and people have felt difficult. They have repeatedly requested the issuance of 1000 yuan notes to meet the needs. At that time, the government insisted on prudence and did not lightly approve it. Recently, due to the Lunar New Year, stores and factories need cash to settle accounts and pay wages, so the cash shortage is even more severe, leading to premiums and numerous abuses. Commercial banks and companies have various restrictions on depositors withdrawing cash, which has a very shallow impact on finance. In order to eliminate the above-mentioned difficulties, eradicate the manipulation of unscrupulous merchants, and smooth the currency flow, the government has specially approved the issuance of 1000 yuan notes by the Central Reserve Bank to stabilize the financial situation. This is a measure to alleviate the difficulty of a shortage of cash in the market, and all our merchants and people should be mindful of this intention. If anyone takes the opportunity to raise prices or disrupt the financial situation, they will be severely punished by law without leniency.</p>
<h3>Today is Air Defense Day; Hope for Serious Drills; Talk by Secretary Cao of the Air Defense Headquarters</h3>
<p>Today (9th) is the 14th Air Defense Day. The Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters is expanding publicity about the meaning of air defense as usual and implementing various air defense training exercises. Citizens should seriously practice under the guidance of police and security personnel. Cao Jingang, the chief secretary of the headquarters, gave a speech stating: "Today is the 14th Air Defense Day. At a time when the war situation is becoming increasingly critical, the implementation of this year's expanded training suddenly takes on a significant meaning, I’d like to make some remarks to inform all the citizens of Shanghai. According to the usual methods of warfare, whenever the war enters a decisive stage, the number of enemy air raids will inevitably increase day by day. If various air defense measures cannot be actively and thoroughly implemented, the result will inevitably be some unnecessary and extremely heavy losses. Past experience is sufficient to prove this, especially since the current era is an era of total war. The people, regardless of gender, and regions, regardless of front or rear, in other words, everyone is a soldier, and every place is a battlefield. Air defense work is the most important part of operations. Therefore, I sincerely hope that all the citizens of Shanghai will make every possible effort to assist the air defense authorities. Even if it is known to be an exercise or training, they must take a serious and active attitude. In this way, all aspects of evacuation and rescue work and skills can be mastered. In the event of an air raid, they will naturally be able to calmly cope, both avoiding unnecessary damage and contributing to social security. This is something that citizens should deeply understand and practice under the wartime system. In the past, during Air Defense Day, some citizens did not pay much attention to it. We firmly believe that those who suffer serious damage under air raids will inevitably be those who are usually indifferent to air defense. Therefore, we hope that starting from this Air Defense Day, with the joint efforts of the authorities and the citizens, we can awaken the awareness of air defense work among all citizens, which will be of great benefit to the defense array of Great Shanghai. Furthermore, the citizens should familiarize themselves with the current air defense regulations, so that their actions during training days or various alarms can be adapted accordingly without any inconvenience."</p>

Looking back, after the return of the concessions, the merger of the One Three and Two Bureaus, and the merger of the One Two Bureaus, the complex police organization was unified. Director Su made twelve times the effort to improve the difficult police tasks, especially paying attention to the lives of the police and making painstaking efforts for the consumer cooperatives. He brought his past experience and his researched police knowledge to play as much as possible, for which we are deeply grateful. We were relying on Director Su's utmost guidance, but the government, for the sake of needing talent, honorably transferred him to the position of Director of the Qingxiang Affairs Bureau, which is a pity. However, we expect Director Su to continue to develop. I, on behalf of all my colleagues, express my infinite respect to Director Su and wish him progress." Then, Director Su delivered a thank-you speech, saying: "Today, I am very grateful for your warm reception amidst the tension of police affairs. At the same time, it is a great pleasure to be back on the seventh floor of the Police Bureau today, 'reuniting' with my old colleagues again. Just now, Deputy Director Du has praised me, and since taking over the concession, I have received guidance from Deputy Director Du and cooperation from all my colleagues, gaining a lot of knowledge and learning a lot of experience, for which I am very grateful. The task of the Police Bureau is to maintain law and order, and the task of the Qingxiang Affairs Bureau is to establish law and order, so the goal is the same. In the Greater East Asia War, the task of maintaining law and order in the rear is very important, and we can only cooperate and must achieve the same goal." After the speech, tea and refreshments were served, and the guests and hosts were in a harmonious mood. The party ended at around 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Police Consumer Cooperative Reorganized into Welfare Society</h3>

<h3>Brief News</h3>
<p>The Shanghai West Vehicle Registration Office Moves to a New Location: To facilitate management, the Municipal Public Works Bureau previously abolished the Xu Cao and Kaiyuan Road vehicle registration offices last year and established the Shanghai West Vehicle Registration Office at the Bureau's Motor Vehicle Inspection Office on Changmi Road, combining operations. As the premises there were narrow and the area small, insufficient for operations, the Bureau has found a suitable location at 94 Fanhangdu Road (formerly Jessfield Road) as the new office. Arrangements began yesterday (8th), and vehicle registration and license issuance will resume as usual from the 12th of this month. Vehicle owners and dealers in the area are advised to take note.</p>
<p>Publication of "Selected Novels by Contemporary Women Writers": Tan Zhengbi's "Selected Novels by Contemporary Women Writers" has been published by the Taiping Bookstore. It includes novels by sixteen writers, including Eileen Chang and Su Qing, and features a lengthy preface of ten thousand words by Tan. The hardcover edition, with over three hundred and forty pages, is priced at only 650 yuan. Subscribers can collect their books from the Bureau upon presentation of their receipt, starting today.</p>
<p>Correction: Yesterday's top news item on this page, "Mr. Zhang Bao Cun, Chairman of the Coffee Shop Industry Association, Pledged 1 Million Yuan," was not a personal pledge but referred to a pledge on behalf of the entire industry. We hereby correct this.</p>
