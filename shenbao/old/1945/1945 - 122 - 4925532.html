<h3>中央社創立五週年舉行紀念儀式趙宣傳部長親臨致訓</h3>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>大東亞民族大會</h3>
<p>大東亞民族大會，業已於日昨在東京舉行，參加大會的計有中國·日本·滿洲·菲律賓·泰國·緬甸·印虔·蒙古·東印度·安南·柬埔寨等各民族代表，實可謂東亞民族前所未有的盛會，尤其是在敵機威脅下的戰都東京舉行，更有風雨同舟齊振敵愾的意義，我們深信這次大會，對於大東亞戰爭的决勝，必有重大的貢獻。</p>
<p>大東亞各民族，曾長期遭受帝國主義的欺凌侮辱，奄奄無生氣者已一百餘年，如果沒有道次日本發動大東亞戰爭，誰能料想得到各民族的代表有歡集於一堂共商維護自身權利的一天，僅以緬甸·東印度·安南諸民族而言，在大東亞戰前，那一個民族有派代表集　的權利？所以，大東，亞民族大會的本身，就是大東亞戰爭目的之正義性革命性及反帝國主義性的證據，我們深信，今後的歷史家必有公論。</p>
<p>但是，今日敵美等却在宣傳的謀略之下，企圖對日本對東亞反攻，妄想否認大東亞諸民挨在日本援助下已經獲得的獨立自由，妄想用歐美的「民主主義」的桎梏，使東亞諸民族重新陷入帝國主義的舊秩序！就以所謂解决戰後國際問題的舊金山會議而論，也沒有規定關於戰後殖民地及東亞民族問題的議程，顯然英美帝國主義以為大東亞戰前的占秩序是很合理而必須恢復的了！因此，我們東亞諸民族在此東亞大局千鈞一髮之際，必須更加團結，集中十億民族的心力物力，以最後粉碎英美帝國主義者重新建設東亞殖民地奴役秩序的迷夢。</p>
<p>今日東亞諸民族中，處於領導地位的，無疑的是中日兩大民族，所以，最後打破敵方的帝國主義的野心，而完遂大東亞戰爭，實現大東亞宜言，就今日的實際情勢而論，首先須取决於中日兩大民族的堅持協力。但是，母庸諱言，令人遺憾的，中日兩大民族間的團結合作，始終是不完全的，不足以應戰局之要求的。</p>
<p>中國今日的大問題，就在全面和平之未能實現，因此中國之參戰義務，任何努力也是事倍功半，而近來所謂大陸物資戰力化，也難期有效的實現。全面和平所以未克實現，一由於和平區的政治經濟文化等設施，為種種環境所束縛，未能盡如理想，未能使重慶統治下的人民欣然來歸。一由於中日戰事，拖延已達八年之久，共黨乘機擴展勢力，日甚一日。如中日問題依然未能獲得全面的合理的解决，則可斷言，重慶所理想的抗戰目的，南京國民政府所理想的和平遝動目的，盟邦日本所倡導的建設大東亞新秩序目的，均將遭遇到更大的困難。</p>
<p>中日民族之全面合作，為大東亞諸民族前途之决定力量。依照目前情勢觀察，中日民族之合作，尤當自實現全面和平開始，而中日全面和平的實現，必須注重現實問題，相互之間，依照旣定國策方針執行。可是，現實情勢的演變發展，如有使旣定國策補充修正的必要，那末，國策為實現原來目的，自應作適應現實的修正。同時，國策的本質，必須是適應現實的。如果謀略宣傳如彼，而現實措施如此，則對於實現國策目的，决不能獲致事半功倍之效，這是中日富局尤應細心把握的問題。</p>
<p>地方通訊</p>
<h3>靑浦鳥瞰</h3>
<p>— 志澄</p>
<p>短短的旅途</p>
<p>靑浦為上海市附折縣治之一，屬於江蘇省，離上海市三十四公里，面積八百十方哩，人口約三十餘萬，位在京滬，蘇嘉，滬杭　三條鐵路綫的中心點。</p>
<p>四月二十八日的早晨，在黃金色的晨　中出發，汽車在靑滬公路上，像一頭老馬似的搖　前進，公路本身是崎嶇的，再加上車輛的陳舊，所以行車很困難。</p>
<p>到吳粗行的大檢間所前，乘客必須全部下車，受嚴格的檢查。過了此關，可以直達靑浦了。路上兩旁的麥田，都顯得靑葱可愛。</p>
<p>抵達靑浦城外的時候，（中午十二時）首先現在眼簾的，是一座古老的城墻，墻上有精神飽滿的盟邦士兵守衛者。不過二小時，便完成了上海到靑浦的旅程。</p>
<p>農產與物價</p>
<p>靑浦能耕之田，約有七十萬畝，今年最上等的田每畝能產三石米，平均產量約每畝二石；以全縣而論，共可得一百四十餘萬石，但農民除交出收買量及繳納田賦外，祗可勉强自給。農田之田賦，依江蘇省三十三年度之規定，改田賦為實物徵收，平均每畝徵米一斗，合毅二十二斤，在產棉區地帶，所繳田賦，亦以米一斗計算。至本縣其他產物，以棉花佔第一位，大豆，麥，蔬菜等，產量亦豐。</p>
<p>一般物價，除米及日用品外，大致與上海相似，如：豆油每斤一千五百元，猪肉每斤一千二百元，雞蛋每只九十元，靑菜每斤六十元等。城內米每担六萬八千元，城外愈向西愈低。日用品因完全由上海運來，沿途經重重關卡，價格自較上海為高。如固本肥皂每塊五百元，草紙每刀二百元，火柴每大包五百元等。當地燃料用稻柴，每捆五十元。</p>
<p>地方的治安</p>
<p>靑浦縣縣治，是分八個區域，城中是第一區，現在治安非常穩定。其他鄕問各區較差。城中除警察外，尙有保安隊囗中隊，最近並由省政府調派囗中隊抵靑補充，故武裝警衛力極良好。民衆本身之保甲組織，經當局指導，極力推動後，亦頗不弱；故竊盜案件，已日漸減少。民衆之軍事訓練，如自衛團，數約五千餘人，皆為朝氣蓬勃之靑年；在縣長黃烈文氏嚴明指導之下，每日在縣政府後院，操練至勤，與軍隊無異。此外尙有盟邦士兵約囗囗名，常駐城內，協力　　當地治安。</p>
<p>民風與敎育</p>
<p>靑浦民風，頗為敦厚，訴訟極少·敎育在事變前，頗為發達，現因格於環境，巳不若前時之盛；現城內有縣立中學一校，公私立之小學共四校，民敎館一處，其餘各區，尙有私立中學二校，私立小學約六校；但辦得如何，因缺乏良好的師資人才，故前途不可樂觀，茲聞當局正在極力改進中。至文化事業方面，有縣政府宣傳科辦的滬江日報，其他如新申報，中華日報等，均由上海運來。</p>
<p>金融與醫藥</p>
<p>本縣有銀行家：為地方銀行·國強銀行裕靑銀行，與上海間之互滙，可由各銀行代辦。城內有規模較大的醫院二所，及中醫診所六處；最近縣當局，向上海採辦西藥五十餘萬元，不久即可運靑，此舉對常地人民之公共衛生不無小補也。</p>
<p>交通現况</p>
<p>靑浦上海間之陸上交通，僅有靑滬公路，自上海大西路至虹橋路，經程家橋。吳家行·盤龍·郊店而抵靑浦東門外。沿途有檢問所凡二。行駛此綫之汽車商行，現為大上海路中南飯店之靑滬長途汽車行，該行有大客車及小汽車二種：大者可容四五十人，小者祇六七人，班期無定，俟客滿即可開出，最近票價大者每位三千元，小者需六千元，唯小汽車行駛較速。</p>
<p>公路之路基及橋樑，在事變後因年久失修，崎嶇不平，塌壞不堪，車行顚箥，雨後尤苦之，亟望當局有以改善，則靑滬問之交通，當可更為通暢矣。</p>
<p>據縣府當局謂：最近因上海疏散人口及慈善機關，遷來靑浦城內及各郊區者，為數甚衆，惟詳情正與當地保甲機關調査中，尙待續報。</p>
<h3>美國軍需生產憶大量減少松平部長揭露敵方焦慮</h3>
<p>盟邦日本大使館上海事務所昨日下午循例舉行報道會議，松平情報部長發表美國軍需生產品短少情况。茲誌大要如次：</p>
<p>民需用品減少生產</p>
<p>最近美國軍需生產品，不能達到預定計劃，故武器彈藥軍需品等，再吿不足，戰時生產局長曾數度主張減少民需品之生產，尤其對於棉紗·布疋·紙張·煤斤·皮革及橡皮製品等，應有大量減少其生產之必要，要求國民一致協力。</p>
<p>軍需生產減低原因</p>
<p>據美當局發表，軍需生產品之所以不能達成計劃原因，　有三端：　消耗太多，譬如去年十二月中菲島作戰時之軍需消耗，與過去十六個月之總消耗量相等。　生產計劃者之估計錯誤，譬如常初以飛機生產為重點，因之大砲砲彈等之生產，為之減低。　最急要軍需生產部門中之勞働力不足，當局因需要七十萬人之勞働力，甚至向各方面加以呼籲，去年十二月中據發表美軍需工廠中需要三十萬人之勞働力，至目下則倍增至七十萬人，可見其對增强生產之如何焦慮矣。</p>
<p>取消定單蒙蔽國民</p>
<p>美當局雖一方面如此向國民要求協力，但在另一方面竟發表最近將取消軍需生產品定單之百分之十五，觀諸以上事實，可知美當局明知其軍需生產不能達到其預定計劃，但為博取國民歡心計，利用此減少定單之苦肉計，以資　蔽耳。</p>
<p>趙部長訓詞</p>
<p>今天是中央社成立五周年紀念日，本人得來參加，衷心十分快慰，本人雖擔任中央社理事長職務，但因本身工作關係，不能與諸君朝夕相處，實在認為憾事。</p>
<p>報道新聞指導民衆</p>
<p>剛才聽到郭社長關於本社應有的任務，已經談得很淸楚。通訊社的任務，最要的有兩點，第一是報道，便是把新聞報道於一般民衆，第二是指導。因為報道，雖以事實主為，不可一概抹殺，但它的輕重與緩急，正確與舛誤，是應加以分別的。本社成立於事變以後，環境是異常複雜，物力是十分缺乏，然而得有今日的成就，已很可觀，雖然我們對於中央社今日的一切尙不能說盡　盡美，但在短短的五年中，有此成就，已經算不容易了，這些都是歷任社長及現任郭社長和諸位同仁的努力的結果，而諸位為國家，為民族，整天到夜的工作，並不以職業觀點，希望能得到怎樣優厚的報酬，這點尤其是使人敬佩的。</p>
<p>推動工作至全世界</p>
<p>說到中央社改組以後的新使命，本人也有意見，希望嗣後不獨把我們的工作推動到中國各地，更要推動到全世界，去使全世界沒有空間和時間的阻隔，發揚我們國家的正義。雖然這是一個不易完成的重任，然事在人為，無論如何艱難的事，並不是不可以完成的。試看世界各國的通訊事業是如何的發達，但以前在草創的時候，也是非常艱難的，但他們能克服艱難，把握時間，使一分一秒的時間也不白費，慢慢的就有了大的成就，人家旣可成功，我們只要努力，自然也能實現。</p>
<p>我國有五千年歷史，但這五千年，不是一蹴而成的，他是經歷了無數的五年，乃至五十年五百年而成的。</p>
<p>實現理想達成任務</p>
<p>中央社雖僅五年，安知他將來不會有五十年，五百年的歷史，歷史證明理想是可以實現的，我們在這戰局嚴重之時，雖然物質條件不充分，人為妨礙日日增加，但我們仍要加緊報道工作，充實指導力量，在極端節約下，實現我們的理想，達成我們的任務，在道五周年紀念的時候，本人特提出這些話，願與諸位共勉。</p>

<h3>佛教講座巡禮</h3>
<p>— 播</p>
<h3>發相旨趣</h3>
<p>中國的佛教除了念經和儀式繁多的說法外，很少能有學術性的討論。一般的僧徒居士，雖有佛學造詣頗深，多為自求學識；而普迦的僧徒，又指望個人的修福消失梢有宗教信仰的意識罷了。本市靜安寺是海上著名的古剎，常以宣讀佛學為佛教徒的習學工作；因此在兩年以前，就創辦佛教講座，請佛教學者如季奜芝　法師前往主講。每次的聽眾常座為之滿，可是佛教的學理，已能普遍社會，引起各界的研究和興趣了。</p>
<h3>講堂一瞥</h3>
<p>四月十五日，該寺又開始第三屆佛教講座，教請華嚴宗應慈老法師宣講華嚴法界玄　。是日為星期日，華者有暇前往聽講。二時半，走進山門，那時候聽從已络绎不绝的到場了，其中有教授學生，公務員，銀行經理，善女人等，各界人士，濟濟一堂。禮堂是一個大廳，佈置得十分整潔；中間滿座，桌上供著一尊佛像，幾列長桌　椅，整齊　　，真是一個講學的所在。三時正，鍾聲大響，嚴老法師準時莅場，　　　樣，和蔼可親，　該寺密迦法師介紹後便開始演講。他先把華　的要議詳細申論，條理清楚，聲音明晰，所以全的聽眾，都沉浸在這個和諧的空氣中，探求智慧的真理。</p>
<h3>華嚴要義</h3>
<p>本篇是務南山僧法順的大作討論宇宙的本體和變化，我們當如何認識期間的關係而獲得超脫。際此世風日下，一般人心迷亂的時候，我們的生活當中摸索，彷徨無依；所以我們必須要了解這個社會，這個人生，建立出一個生活的哲學。筆者不是佛教徒，更沒有研究佛學，但是總覺得佛教的學理是一種偉大而深邃的哲學，這種哲學要比西洋的哲學透澈和缜密。我想我們個個人都有一種生活的態度和希望，也就是生活的哲學。然而這種哲學，普通常沒有來就沒有　　，佛教的學理，就是給我們一個啟示認識生活的途徑，我們依照了這條途徑來應付當前的問題，從事社會的事業，便得到一個完美的生活了。</p>
<h3>訪問寺院</h3>
<p>聽講座，為了拜嚴老法師又得會見該寺的德悟和尚和密迦法師，因此知道了一些他們舉辦佛教講座的旨趣。同時又明了靜安寺最近三年來的工作，不但已　整寺務，心良流俗佛事和整理寺座，而且在南翔的下院，創設了一個佛教南翔鄉村小學，使當地的鄉村兒童，都能夠得到求學的機會；每逢寒暑兩假的時候，學辦佛教助學金，救濟了不少失學青年。又聞最近在　　重建山門，並在門前的湧泉井畔，聚一梵幢，以彰古　。在此時勞艱難的時候，這種建築，固然並非急務，然而正因為戰爭的時期，文化衰落，道德沦亡，我們若在可能　　中共同來完成完成這項工程，實是很有價值。此外，　施送寒衣，　　　　,都很有益社會，值得報告的。</p>
<h3>人間佛教</h3>
<p>最後，我們對於佛教和寺院得到一個新的觀念。就是佛教的學理是一種精密的哲學。固然，我們並不要做一個哲學家或佛學家，但是，我們的生活一定要有態度要有奮發，那麼佛教的哲學就會給我們一種啟示。往昔，我們常以為佛教的人生是出世的，是消極的，這是一種錯覺。同時，我們往往認為寺院是社會上的另一世界，僧尼的生活，同世人並無關係，這也是一種誤解。理想的寺院，應該是一個弘揚佛法報務社會的組織，並不是僅求消災祈福或隔絕塵世的（仙界）（聖地）。這種提　（人間佛教）的精神，就是我們的理想佛教。</p>
<p>（按：佛教講座現定每星期三、六、日下午三時半至五時為講經時間，歡迎各界人士前往聽講。）</p>

<h3>Japanese Navy Establishes General Headquarters to Cope with Modern Warfare; General Toyoda Appointed as First Commander-in-Chief</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency Dispatch) — The Imperial Japanese Navy, in order to cope with the current war situation, has established a General Headquarters. Vice Admiral Soemu Toyoda has been specially appointed as the first Commander-in-Chief, officially announced on the 1st. From now on, the Japanese Navy's structure will be further consolidated, and the entire army will be led by General Toyoda, all embracing the determination to fight to the death to destroy the enemy.</p>
<p>General Toyoda's Address to the Entire Army</p>
<p>A Certain Base, 1st (Central News Agency Dispatch) — "The rise or fall of the Imperial Nation rests on this one battle. Each and every one of you must strive even harder in combat." These were the golden words spoken by the holy General Togo Heihachiro thirty-one years ago on May 2nd, inspiring his officers and men to defeat the Russian fleet. Recalling the past and looking at the present, before we know it, the Japanese Navy Memorial Day is approaching again. As this memorial day draws near, the decisive battles on the southwestern islands are intensifying day by day. The Imperial Japanese Combined Fleet and the Army Air Force, working together closely, are determined to annihilate the arrogant enemy in one fell swoop, but the enemy is not yielding in the slightest and is strongly attempting to invade. Therefore, in the past few days, both sides have been exerting all their strength in a desperate battle, and the decisive battle has reached its climax. At this critical juncture, Soemu Toyoda, the Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, who bears the fate of the Japanese Empire, has now been appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, commanding the three services in the vast Pacific Ocean. He has issued an instruction, conveyed to the entire army as follows: "I have now received the great order to serve as the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy. I am willing to share the heavy responsibility of this decisive battle with all of you, my officers and men. May all of my officers and men, both at home and abroad, fully understand my intentions and vow to eliminate the arrogant enemy! The glory of the divine land depends on today. As for how to cope with such a critical situation, I believe all of you, loyal and brave officers and men, already know it well: that is, for the entire force to become a special attack force and sacrifice yourselves for the great cause. Upon hearing this instruction, all the officers and men were filled with solemn respect and vowed to destroy the enemy.</p>
<h3>Major Personnel Changes in the Japanese Navy Ministry</h3>

<h3>Allied Military Authorities Offer Rewards for Capturing Enemy Pilots Alive</h3>
<p>Nanjing, May 1st (Central News Agency Dispatch) — Recently, the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing has been indiscriminately bombing our peaceful areas, causing unwarranted damage to the lives and property of innocent civilians, which is truly hateful. During these bombings, enemy planes are sometimes shot down and crash, or pilots are forced to land due to mechanical failures. Our people, motivated by righteous indignation against these violent enemies, should certainly make efforts to search for and capture them. It has been learned that the Allied military authorities have established a reward system for capturing these violent enemies. Anyone who can capture an enemy alive, or provide confidential information about their hiding places leading to their capture, will be rewarded with 1 million yuan in cash. Those who provide confidential information, capture the enemy, and hand them over can do so to the nearest Allied forces.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Greater East Asia Conference</h3>
<p>The Greater East Asia Conference has already been held yesterday in Tokyo. The conference was attended by representatives from various nations, including China, Japan, Manchukuo, the Philippines, Thailand, Burma, India, Mongolia, East India, Annam, and Cambodia. It is truly an unprecedented grand meeting of East Asian nations. Especially held in Tokyo, a war-torn capital under the threat of enemy aircraft, it holds even more significance in demonstrating shared adversity and unity in resisting the enemy. We firmly believe that this conference will make a significant contribution to the decisive victory of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>The various nations of Greater East Asia have long suffered from the oppression and humiliation of imperialism, and for over a hundred years, their vitality has been waning. If Japan had not launched the Greater East Asia War, who could have imagined that the representatives of these nations would have the opportunity to gather together and discuss the safeguarding of their own rights? Taking only the nations of Burma, East India, and Annam as examples, which of them had the right to send representatives to gather together before the Greater East Asia War? Therefore, the Greater East Asia Conference itself is evidence of the righteousness, revolutionary nature, and anti-imperialist nature of the aims of the Greater East Asia War. We firmly believe that future historians will have a fair judgment.</p>
<p>However, today the enemy, America and others, are attempting to counterattack Japan and East Asia under the guise of propaganda tactics, vainly attempting to deny the independence and freedom that the various nations of Greater East Asia have already gained with Japanese assistance, and vainly attempting to use the shackles of Western "democracy" to plunge the nations of East Asia back into the old order of imperialism! Taking the San Francisco Conference, which claims to resolve postwar international issues, as an example, there is no agenda item regarding postwar colonies and the issues of East Asian nations. Clearly, British and American imperialism believe that the old order before the Greater East Asia War was very reasonable and must be restored! Therefore, at this critical moment in the overall situation of East Asia, our East Asian nations must be even more united, concentrating the hearts, minds, and material resources of a billion people to finally shatter the daydreams of the British and American imperialists to rebuild a colonial and enslaving order in East Asia.</p>
<p>Among the nations of East Asia today, the two major nations of China and Japan undoubtedly hold the leading position. Therefore, to ultimately break the enemy's imperialist ambitions, complete the Greater East Asia War, and realize the Greater East Asia Declaration, the steadfast cooperation of the two major nations of China and Japan is essential in the current practical situation. However, it cannot be denied that regrettably, the unity and cooperation between the two major nations of China and Japan has always been incomplete, insufficient to meet the demands of the war situation.</p>
<p>The major problem in China today lies in the failure to achieve overall peace. Therefore, any effort in China's war participation is achieving half the results for double the effort. Furthermore, the so-called conversion of mainland resources into war power has been difficult to effectively realize. The reason why overall peace has not been achieved is due to the fact that the political, economic, and cultural facilities in the peaceful areas are constrained by various circumstances, failing to meet the ideal and failing to make the people under the rule of Chongqing gladly return. Another reason is that the Sino-Japanese War has dragged on for eight years, allowing the Communist Party to seize the opportunity to expand its power day by day. If the Sino-Japanese issue still cannot obtain a comprehensive and rational solution, then it can be asserted that the war resistance aims idealized by Chongqing, the peace movement aims idealized by the Nanjing Nationalist Government, and the aims of building a new order in Greater East Asia advocated by the Allied nation of Japan will all encounter even greater difficulties.</p>
<p>The comprehensive cooperation between the Chinese and Japanese nations is the decisive force for the future of the various nations of Greater East Asia. According to observations of the current situation, the cooperation between the Chinese and Japanese nations should begin with the realization of overall peace. The realization of comprehensive Sino-Japanese peace must focus on realistic issues, with each other implementing them in accordance with established national policies. However, if the evolution and development of the realistic situation requires the established national policies to be supplemented and revised, then the national policies should be revised accordingly to adapt to the reality in order to achieve the original aims. At the same time, the essence of national policies must be to adapt to reality. If propaganda and strategies are implemented in one way, while the actual measures are implemented in another, then the goal of achieving national policy cannot be achieved with half the effort for double the results. This is an issue that the Sino-Japanese situation must carefully grasp.</p>

<h3>A Bird's-Eye View of Qingpu</h3>
<p>— Zhicheng</p>
<p>A Short Journey</p>
<p>Qingpu is one of the affiliated counties of Shanghai, belonging to Jiangsu Province. It is 34 kilometers away from Shanghai, covering an area of 810 square miles, with a population of approximately 300,000. It is located at the central point of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, the Suzhou-Jiaxing Railway, and the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway.</p>
<p>I set off in the golden morning light on April 28th. The car lurched forward on the Qinghu Highway like an old horse. The highway itself was rugged, coupled with the age of the vehicle, making travel very difficult.</p>
<p>Passengers must get out of the car in front of the large inspection checkpoint in Wujiahang and undergo strict inspection. After passing this checkpoint, one can go directly to Qingpu. The wheat fields on both sides of the road are lush and lovely.</p>
<p>When I arrived outside Qingpu City (at 12:00 noon), the first thing that caught my eye was an ancient city wall, guarded by spirited Allied soldiers. In just two hours, the journey from Shanghai to Qingpu was completed.</p>
<p>Agricultural Production and Prices</p>
<p>Qingpu has approximately 700,000 mu of arable land. This year, the highest-quality land can produce three shi of rice per mu, with an average yield of approximately two shi per mu. For the entire county, a total of over 1.4 million shi can be obtained. However, after farmers hand over the purchased amount and pay agricultural taxes, they can only barely sustain themselves. The agricultural tax on farmland is collected in kind according to the regulations of Jiangsu Province for the 33rd year of the Republic, averaging one dou of rice per mu, equivalent to 22 jin. In cotton-producing areas, the agricultural tax paid is also calculated at one dou of rice. Among other products of the county, cotton ranks first, followed by soybeans, wheat, vegetables, etc., which are also produced in abundance.</p>
<p>General commodity prices, except for rice and daily necessities, are roughly similar to those in Shanghai. For example: soybean oil costs 1,500 yuan per jin, pork costs 1,200 yuan per jin, eggs cost 90 yuan each, and vegetables cost 60 yuan per jin. Rice within the city costs 68,000 yuan per dan, and the price decreases further west outside the city. Daily necessities are entirely transported from Shanghai, passing through numerous checkpoints along the way, so prices are naturally higher than in Shanghai. For example, a bar of Gu Ben soap costs 500 yuan, a ream of straw paper costs 200 yuan, and a large bundle of matches costs 500 yuan. Local fuel is rice straw, costing 50 yuan per bundle.</p>
<p>Local Public Security</p>
<p>Qingpu County is divided into eight districts. The city is the first district, and public security is currently very stable. The other districts in the countryside are in poorer condition. In addition to the police in the city, there is also a local defense team and a team from another location. Recently, the provincial government dispatched teams from other locations to Qingpu for reinforcement, so the armed guards are excellent. The people's own Baojia (neighborhood watch) organization, after being guided and vigorously promoted by the authorities, is also quite strong. Therefore, theft cases have gradually decreased. The people's military training, such as the self-defense corps, numbers approximately 5,000 people, all energetic youths. Under the strict guidance of County Magistrate Huang Liewen, they train diligently every day in the backyard of the county government, no different from the military. In addition, there are approximately [unclear] Allied soldiers stationed in the city, assisting in maintaining local public security.</p>
<p>Local Customs and Education</p>
<p>Qingpu's customs are quite honest and generous, and lawsuits are extremely rare. Education was quite developed before the incident, but it is not as prosperous as before due to environmental constraints. Currently, there is one county-run middle school in the city and a total of four public and private primary schools, and one people's education center. In the other districts, there are two private middle schools and approximately six private primary schools. However, their performance is uncertain due to a lack of good teachers. I have heard that the authorities are vigorously trying to improve them. As for cultural undertakings, the county government's propaganda section publishes the Hujiang Daily. Other newspapers, such as the Xin Shen Bao and the Zhonghua Daily, are transported from Shanghai.</p>
<p>Finance and Medicine</p>
<p>The county has banks: Local Bank, Guoqiang Bank, and Yuqing Bank. Remittances to and from Shanghai can be handled by various banks. There are two relatively large hospitals and six clinics of traditional Chinese medicine in the city. Recently, the county authorities purchased over 500,000 yuan of Western medicine from Shanghai, which will soon be transported to Qingpu. This move will be of no small benefit to the public health of the local people.</p>
<p>Current Transportation Conditions</p>
<p>The only land transportation between Qingpu and Shanghai is the Qinghu Highway, which runs from Daxilu in Shanghai to Hongqiao Road, via Chengjiaqiao, Wujiahang, Panlong, and Jiaodian, to the outside of Qingpu's East Gate. There are two inspection checkpoints along the way. The car business running this route is currently the Qinghu Long-Distance Bus Company of the Dashanghai Road Zhongnan Hotel. The company has large buses and small cars: the large ones can accommodate 40 to 50 people, while the small ones only have 6 or 7. The schedule is irregular, and they depart as soon as they are full. Recently, the fare for the large buses is 3,000 yuan per person, and the small cars require 6,000 yuan. However, the small cars travel faster.</p>
<p>The roadbed and bridges of the highway have been in disrepair for many years since the incident, becoming rugged and uneven, collapsing and unusable. The car travels with bumps and jolts, which is especially painful after rain. It is hoped that the authorities will improve them so that transportation between Qingpu and Shanghai can be smoother.</p>
<p>According to county government officials, recently, a large number of people and charitable organizations have been evacuated from Shanghai and relocated to Qingpu city and various suburbs. However, the details are currently being investigated by local Baojia organizations and will be reported later.</p>
<h3>US Military Production Significantly Reduced: Minister Matsudaira Reveals Enemy Anxiety</h3>
<p>The Shanghai office of the Allied Japanese Embassy held its routine press conference yesterday afternoon. Information Minister Matsudaira announced the reduction in US military production. The main points are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>民需用品減少生產</p>
<h3>Reduction in Production of Civilian Goods</h3>
<p>Recently, US military production has failed to meet planned targets, resulting in shortages of weapons, ammunition, and other military supplies. The head of the War Production Board has repeatedly advocated reducing the production of civilian goods, especially cotton yarn, cloth, paper, coal, leather, and rubber products, calling for a significant reduction in their production and urging national cooperation.</p>
<p>軍需生產減低原因</p>
<h3>Reasons for Reduced Military Production</h3>
<p>According to the US authorities, there are three reasons why military production has failed to meet planned targets: 1. Excessive consumption. For example, the military supplies consumed during the Philippine Islands operation in December of last year were equivalent to the total consumption of the previous sixteen months. 2. Errors in the estimation of production planners. For example, initially, emphasis was placed on aircraft production, leading to a reduction in the production of artillery and shells. 3. Insufficient labor in the most urgent military production sectors. The authorities need 700,000 laborers and are even appealing in all directions. It was announced in December of last year that US military factories needed 300,000 laborers, which has now doubled to 700,000, demonstrating their anxiety to increase production.</p>
<p>取消定單蒙蔽國民</p>
<h3>Canceling Orders to Deceive the Public</h3>
<p>While the US authorities are asking the public for cooperation on the one hand, they are announcing on the other hand that they will cancel 15% of military production orders. Considering the above facts, it can be seen that the US authorities are well aware that their military production cannot meet their planned targets, but to win public favor, they are using this "bitter flesh" tactic of reducing orders to deceive the public.</p>
<p>趙部長訓詞</p>
<h3>Minister Zhao's Address</h3>
<p>Today is the fifth anniversary of the founding of the Central News Agency. I am very pleased to be here to participate. Although I serve as the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Central News Agency, due to my own work, I cannot spend every day with you, which I consider a regret.</p>
<p>報道新聞指導民衆</p>
<h3>Reporting News and Guiding the Public</h3>
<p>I just heard President Guo speak very clearly about the tasks that this agency should have. The most important tasks of a news agency are twofold: first, to report, that is, to report the news to the general public; and second, to guide. Because reporting, although based primarily on facts, cannot be entirely unbiased. The importance and urgency, accuracy and errors of the news should be distinguished. This agency was established after the incident, the environment is extremely complex, and resources are very scarce. However, today's achievements are very impressive. Although we cannot say that everything about the Central News Agency today is perfect, such achievements in just five years are not easy. These are the results of the efforts of the past presidents, the current President Guo, and all colleagues. You work for the country and the nation from morning till night, not from a professional point of view, hoping to get generous rewards. This point is especially admirable.</p>
<p>推動工作至全世界</p>
<h3>Promoting Work to the World</h3>
<p>Speaking of the new mission of the Central News Agency after the reorganization, I also have some opinions. I hope that in the future, we will not only promote our work to all parts of China, but also to the whole world, so that the world has no spatial or temporal barriers, and promote the justice of our country. Although this is a difficult task to accomplish, it is up to people to do it. No matter how difficult things are, they are not impossible to accomplish. Look at how developed the communication industry is in various countries around the world, but in the early days, it was also very difficult. But they were able to overcome difficulties and seize the time, making every second count, and slowly they achieved great success. If others can succeed, we can naturally achieve it as long as we work hard.</p>
<p>我國有五千年歷史，但這五千年，不是一蹴而成的，他是經歷了無數的五年，乃至五十年五百年而成的。</p>
<p>Our country has a history of 5,000 years, but these 5,000 years were not achieved overnight. They were achieved through countless five years, even fifty years, five hundred years.</p>
<p>實現理想達成任務</p>
<h3>Realize Ideals and Accomplish Tasks</h3>
<p>Although the Central News Agency is only five years old, who knows if it will not have fifty or five hundred years of history in the future? History proves that ideals can be realized. At this time of serious war situation, although the material conditions are not sufficient and human obstacles are increasing every day, we must still step up our reporting work, strengthen our guidance force, and realize our ideals and accomplish our tasks under extreme austerity. On the occasion of the fifth anniversary, I would like to put forward these words to encourage you all.</p>

<h3>Entertainment Venues and Shops Strictly Prohibited from Operating Overtime; Violators Will Be Reported to the Police Bureau for Punishment</h3>
<p>The City Police Bureau manages entertainment venues and shops operating overtime, originally as a special measure for wartime frugality and strengthening protection of public security. The implementation method should be that each branch bureau divides the areas within its jurisdiction and assigns officers to be responsible for strict inspection. If any violations are found, a form must be filled out and reported to the main bureau, and a punishment notice should be issued as usual to impose penalties. This is to facilitate the investigation of the number of violations to determine the severity of the punishment. However, it has recently been found that many branch bureaus impose penalties without reporting, which is inappropriate. The bureaus have been instructed that in the future, any violations of overtime operation should be reported to the main bureau for penalty according to the regulations. It is also learned that the Second Division of the Bureau held a meeting of the directors of the Second Sections of each branch bureau the day before, where Director Ping delivered a speech, hoping that the directors of each section will strictly supervise and inspect the operating hours of entertainment venues, and report any violations truthfully to the main bureau for handling according to the prescribed methods.</p>
<h3>Director Gao Took Office Yesterday</h3>
<p>The new acting Director of the First Division of the City Police Bureau, Gao Xian, officially took office at the Bureau yesterday morning. Mr. Gao has extremely rich knowledge and experience. This time, taking office as the Director of the Bureau will surely assist the Director in promoting administrative management.</p>
<h3>Strengthening Police Welfare Work</h3>
<p>Since Director Jian of the City Police Bureau took office, he has been exceptionally concerned about the lives of police officers. Measures such as raising salaries and allocating free rice have been implemented. In particular, increasing the Police Welfare Society's fund and strengthening police welfare work has greatly reduced the burden on police officers. Recently, items such as cooking oil and cigarettes have been distributed. It is also planned to distribute 2 jin of table salt per person (85 yuan per jin) on May 2nd and 3rd. Daily necessities such as firewood, briquettes, kerosene, undershirts, and towels will continue to be distributed.</p>
<h3>Outstanding Issuance of Sugar for the 19th Household Quota</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Sugar Merchant Cooperative Business Office announced that the sugar that retail merchants collected during the sales period of the 19th household quota sugar but did not issue has been supplemented. Those who have handed over their 44th comprehensive ration certificate and Y-marked ticket to the retail merchant during the sales period and obtained a receipt from the store should collect the sugar from the store from May 6th to 10th with the receipt. No supplementary issuance will be made after the deadline. The sugar supplemented will be granulated sugar for Chinese residents in each district and coarse sugar for foreign residents.</p>
<h3>Buddhist Lecture Pilgrimage</h3>
<p>— Broadcasting</p>
<h3>Intention of Propagation</h3>
<p>In Chinese Buddhism, apart from chanting scriptures and numerous rituals, there is very little academic discussion. Although general monks and laypeople have considerable knowledge of Buddhism, they mostly seek knowledge for themselves; while most monks only hope to accumulate merit and have a slight awareness of religious belief. Jing'an Temple in this city is a famous ancient temple on the sea, and often uses the reading of Buddhist studies as the learning work of Buddhists; therefore, two years ago, it established Buddhist lectures, inviting Buddhist scholars such as Dharma Master Jifeizhi to be the main speaker. The audience is often full every time, and the academic principles of Buddhism have been able to be popularized in society, arousing research and interest from all walks of life.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Lecture Hall</h3>
<p>On April 15th, the temple began the third Buddhist lecture, and invited Venerable Elder Dharma Master Ying Ci of the Huayan School to lecture on the Huayan Dharma Realm Xuanyi. That day was Sunday, and those who had time went to listen. At 2:30, I walked into the mountain gate, and at that time, listeners were coming in an endless stream. Among them were professors, students, civil servants, bank managers, virtuous women, and people from all walks of life, gathered together. The auditorium was a large hall, decorated very neatly; the middle was full of seats, with a Buddha statue enshrined on the table, and several rows of long tables and chairs, neatly arranged, truly a place for lectures. At exactly 3 o'clock, the bell rang loudly, and Venerable Elder Dharma Master arrived on time, dignified and approachable. After being introduced by Dharma Master Miga of the temple, he began to lecture. He first explained the essential issues of Huayan in detail, clearly and articulately, so all the listeners were immersed in this harmonious atmosphere, exploring the truth of wisdom.</p>
<h3>The Essentials of Huayan</h3>
<p>This article is a great work by Nanshan monk Fashun, discussing the essence and changes of the universe, and how we should understand the relationship between them to achieve transcendence. In this era of declining morals and general confusion, we grope and wander aimlessly in our lives; therefore, we must understand this society and this life, and establish a philosophy of life. The author is not a Buddhist, nor has he studied Buddhism, but he always feels that the academic principles of Buddhism are a great and profound philosophy, which is more thorough and meticulous than Western philosophy. I think we all have an attitude and hope for life, which is the philosophy of life. However, this philosophy usually has no, and the academic principles of Buddhism are to give us an inspiration to recognize the path of life. We follow this path to deal with current problems and engage in social undertakings, and we will get a perfect life.</p>
<h3>Visiting the Temple</h3>
<p>Listening to the lecture, I also got to meet Abbot Dewu and Dharma Master Miga of the temple to pay respects to Elder Yan, so I learned about their intention to hold Buddhist lectures. At the same time, I also learned about the work of Jing'an Temple in the past three years. Not only has it reorganized the temple affairs, followed the customs of secular Buddhist affairs, and reorganized the temple seats, but also in the lower courtyard in Nanxiang, it established a Buddhist Nanxiang Rural Elementary School, so that the local rural children can all get the opportunity to study. Every winter and summer vacation, the school runs Buddhist scholarships, rescuing many young people who have dropped out of school. It is also heard that the mountain gate is being rebuilt, and a Brahma stupa is being built next to the Yongquan Well in front of the gate to highlight the ancient site. At this time of hardship, this kind of construction is certainly not an urgent matter, but precisely because of the war, the decline of culture, and the demise of morality, if we can jointly complete this project in the possibility, it is very valuable. In addition, giving away winter clothes and are all very beneficial to society and worth reporting.</p>
<h3>Humanistic Buddhism</h3>
<p>Finally, we have a new concept of Buddhism and temples. That is, the academic principles of Buddhism are a precise philosophy. Of course, we don't want to be a philosopher or a Buddhist scholar, but our life must have an attitude and strive, then the philosophy of Buddhism will give us an inspiration. In the past, we often thought that Buddhist life was otherworldly and passive, which is a misconception. At the same time, we often think that temples are another world in society, and the lives of monks and nuns have nothing to do with the world, which is also a misunderstanding. An ideal temple should be an organization that promotes Buddhist Dharma and serves society, not just seeking to eliminate disasters and pray for blessings or isolate from the mundane world. This spirit of raising (humanistic Buddhism) is our ideal Buddhism.</p>
<p>(Note: Buddhist lectures are now scheduled to be held every Wednesday and Saturday from 3:30 PM to 5:00 PM, and people from all walks of life are welcome to attend.)</p>
<h3>More than 300 Factories Have Electricity Restored</h3>
<p>Industrial plants in this city, since the power supply was cut off last November, production has been stalled. They have repeatedly applied to the competent authorities for ways to restore it. The electricity company considered and responded, and from last month, it has separately approved a suitable amount of electricity for the factories of major industrial products to maintain operations. It is learned that last month (April) electricity has been restored, including factories in textiles, silk weaving, dyeing and weaving, daily necessities, chemicals, and raw materials, with the textile industry ranking first. However, the power distribution factories are limited to industrial production factories that require electricity, and general factories that manufacture luxury goods and consumer goods will not enjoy intermediate treatment. In addition, the industrial plants with restored power supply were investigated and approved by the relevant authorities.</p>
<h3>Spring Business Tax Preliminary Investigation Began Yesterday</h3>
<p>The deadline for the City Finance Bureau to collect the declaration of business tax for all industries in the city officially ended on April 30th. From May 1st, it has proceeded according to the , Fashan, Madang, City Center, Chanbei, and Hongkou districts. The Bureau has assigned investigators to each district to conduct preliminary investigations into the spring business tax. It is reported that the investigators have been instructed in advance by the competent department on the necessary conditions for reporting duties, and will conduct the investigation step by step according to the steps to be investigated, and fill in the Daily Investigation Report Form to quickly collect and submit to the Bureau for detailed review. The merchants who have passed the preliminary investigation are given a green (inspection certificate) sticker to show distinction. The top of the certificate is printed with (Shanghai Special City Finance Bureau Guan Industry Tax District Collection Office), the middle horizontally lists (Business Tax Inspection Certificate), and the bottom is the (Day, Month, Year of the 34th Year of the Republic of China) text. If the Bureau needs to carry out a re-examination in the future, it needs to give the inspected merchants a red (inspection certificate). All the text on the certificate is the same as the preliminary inspection certificate. The main items of the business tax are very detailed according to the provisions in the daily report. Excerpts include business type, tax rate, capital or turnover, original amount declared (amount, tax amount), corrected amount (amount, tax amount), increased amount (amount, tax amount), and the name of the investigator.</p>
<h3>Public Security Propaganda Committee to Hold Inauguration Ceremony Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Public Security Section of the Municipal Police Bureau, in order to strengthen the public security organization and promote its effectiveness, has respectfully requested the Municipal Public Security Committee to hire publicity and reporting personnel to form a propaganda committee. It has also appointed personnel from various newspaper agencies and publicity officers from various districts to establish the Public Security Propaganda Committee. The committee is scheduled to hold its inauguration ceremony tomorrow (the 3rd) at 6:30 PM at the Datong Restaurant. Section Chief Man Wu of the Public Security Section and Director Chen Bin of the Propaganda Committee have jointly applied to relevant parties for their attendance and participation in the ceremony.</p>
<h3>Special Tax Still Required for Using Similar Items to Purchase Ornaments</h3>
<p>The Bureau of Finance stipulates that when purchasing gold and silver ornaments from various silver shops in the city with similar items as payment, a receipt proving that the special tax was paid when the similar items were purchased must be presented to avoid paying the tax again. Otherwise, the silver shop must collect the special tax in full on behalf of the government to prevent evasion. If a silver shop attempts to attract customers by intentionally waiving the special tax for customers who cannot provide proof or falsely reports tax exemptions for customers who have already paid, in order to profit from it, it will be punished by the Bureau according to regulations upon discovery, and the tax will be recovered as a deterrent. The Bureau has already issued a public notice to notify businesses.</p>
<h3>Bureau of Economy Urges Registration of Major Commodities</h3>
<p>Regarding the registration of major commodities in this city, the competent authorities have already notified various trade associations to promptly complete the registration within the deadline of April 16th to May 15th, as announced. A reporter learned yesterday from the person in charge of the Municipal Bureau of Economy that since the implementation of the major commodity registration for half a month, those who registered on time were very enthusiastic, but there were still many who delayed and did not complete the registration. The various trade associations have been urged to inform their member businesses to promptly complete the registration procedures within the deadline. Once the deadline is exceeded, they will be punished according to regulations without exception. With only half a month remaining, all merchants and citizens should pay close attention and avoid harming themselves.</p>
<h3>Summer Food and Beverage Establishments Should Comply with Regulations</h3>
<p>In order to prevent epidemics and ensure the health of citizens, the Municipal Health Bureau has specifically stipulated that from May 1st, restaurants, taverns, hotels, and places that sell food and beverages must comply with the following regulations during the summer season: 1. All food production sites, kitchens, and toilets must be equipped with screens on windows and doors and prepare screen cabinets and covers (to be installed by May 15th). 2. No cold dishes may be sold. 3. Natural ice may not be used. 4. Well water may not be used as a beverage or for washing bowls and utensils. In unavoidable circumstances, it must be boiled first before use.</p>
<h3>Strict Prohibition of Hawking Unhygienic Food</h3>
<p>All unhygienic foods and beverages, whether sold in stalls or hawked along the streets, are strictly prohibited, including: frozen beverages (except those produced in factories with permits, mechanically bottled, and frozen with purified ice), natural ice, colored water, rotten fruits, sour plum soup, ice cream, popsicles, cut fruits (including peeled sugar cane and lotus root, etc.), jelly, and all bottled sodas sold retail after opening. If there are intentional violators, they will be strictly investigated and dealt with upon verification.</p>
<h3>Yangtze River Route Shipping to Adjust Fares</h3>
<p>Shipping companies operating on the Yangtze River routes upstream and downstream have recently applied to the China Navigation Company for fare adjustments for all passenger tickets due to increased expenses. The company is carefully considering this, as it is concerned about increasing the burden on passengers.</p>
<h3>Bai Guang Concert Ticket Reservations Open Today</h3>
<p>The Bai Guang concert, sponsored by the Shanghai Music Association, will be held at the Lyceum Theatre on the 5th, 6th, and 7th of this month. It will be performed in the most luxurious manner, accompanied by a renowned symphony orchestra, truly providing a great opportunity to appreciate singing. The first performance on the 5th afternoon will be entirely for honorary tickets. For the remaining five performances, in order to promote accessibility to the general public, special and premium seat prices have been set at 1,000, 2,000, and 3,000 yuan respectively. After deducting expenses, all proceeds will be donated to the anti-tuberculosis fund. Public reservations are open starting today to avoid disappointment.</p>
<h3>New Measures Established for the Collection and Settlement of Checks in the Banking and Money Industries</h3>
<p>Due to the recent shortage of cash in the city, the number of checks collected and paid by various banks and money shops in the banking and money industries has increased, resulting in very busy work for the silver association, money shops, treasury income, and transfers. In order to prevent the issuance of bad checks and maintain the reputation of the industry, new measures for the collection and settlement of checks have been established and officially implemented starting yesterday (the 1st). According to financial sources, the silver and money shop associations fear that various banks and money shops in the industry may not be able to comply with the four measures specified immediately after their implementation. Therefore, in addition to separately convening administrative meetings of those in charge of each section, the associations and treasuries will also conduct detailed discussions on the income of each bank and shop to the treasury, the treasury to the central bank, and the summary and publication of general ledger accounts. The decided matters have been notified to each bank and shop for compliance.</p>

<h3>Basic Education Lecture Series Initiates Fundraising for Charity School Scholarships and Distributes Books as Mementos</h3>
<p>All the students of the (Basic Education Lecture Series) organized by this newspaper, recognizing that the Shanghai News's various free elementary schools are well-managed and effective, but that funding has not yet been fully raised, have initiated a fundraising campaign for (Charity School) Scholarship Funds, with a goal of two million yuan. Anyone who donates 50 yuan or more will receive a bookmark as a memento. Currently, the students are conducting fundraising in various locations, and teachers and students from more than a dozen schools in the city are actively responding. Approximately 15,000 bookmarks have already been distributed, and it is expected that the goal can be achieved within half a month. The bookmarks are exquisitely printed with artistic designs and are visually appealing. The reverse side is printed with (Promoting the Spirit of Wu Xun), Responding to the Charity School Movement. This newspaper's service-oriented colleagues extend their utmost respect to individuals from all walks of life who have generously donated, demonstrating high sentiments and profound friendship.</p>
<h3>Saving Candy Money to Donate to Charity School Scholarships</h3>
<p>All the fifth-grade students of the Affiliated Elementary School of Yu Xing Middle School wrote: (We are deeply moved and sympathetic that your newspaper has established free schools to help children who are out of school. To respond to this movement, our grade has initiated saving a week's worth of candy money, raising 20,000 yuan to be used for charity school scholarships. We know that this small amount of money is a drop in the bucket, but we hope that all the children in Shanghai can be determined to do the same, and then the result will be twice the effect with half the effort.)</p>
<h3>Planting a Wide Field of Blessings</h3>
<p>1. Mr./Ms. Mian, deeply moved by the disaster-stricken areas, generously donated 100,000 yuan, divided into 40,000 yuan for small-scale loans from this organization, and 20,000 yuan each for maternity aid, poverty relief, and aid for orphaned children, in order to plant a wide field of blessings and bring good fortune. Additionally, Mr./Ms. Mian Shan also donated 10,000 yuan each to the nursing home and aid for orphaned children, with the same purpose.</p>
<p>2. Ren Zhe Shui Luo Wu Ren Lai Yu wrote: (I am respectfully offering 10,000 yuan, please divide it into 1,000 yuan each for your organization's poverty relief, children's welfare home, nursing home, and Xu Jia Hui Sacred Mother's Hospital. The remaining 4,000 yuan is donated to poverty relief, considering that poor and sick fellow villagers lack the means to find work and cannot afford to return home, and are in fact miserable beggars, especially to be used for the transportation expenses of poor and sick fellow villagers from Biyun (Yuyao) returning home. I know that this small amount of money is useless, but I occasionally think (accumulating fox fur from armpits), (accumulating sand to form a tower), if we can all fulfill our heavenly duty of mutual assistance, establish a return-home travel subsidy fund to assist poor, sick, and unemployed fellow villagers in dispersing and avoid suffering on the wrong path and falling into the hardship of a foreign land, it will embody the government's intention to disperse the population from above and benefit poor compatriots infinitely from below. This will be a great fortune for the fellow villagers and a great fortune for society.)</p>
