<h3>日海上護衛部隊　擊沉敵潛艇六艘　英空母三艘襲先島時受創</h3>
<p>某海軍基地九日中央社電　美軍最近竭力圖封鎖日本土港灣，破壊海上交通，以B29型機於內地主要地點布設機雷，同時復以多數潛艇於南方各地及中國海上出沒，日海上護衛部隊爲確保交通路綫，特連日攻擊敵潛艇，自六月上句迄現在約一月之間，業於本土近海確實擊沉敵潛艇六艘，現仍繼續由空海兩方搜索敵潛獎中。</p>
<p>東京九日中央社電　敵機P51型一百五十架，於八日下午零時半　製關東地方之機塲時，當爲日方擊落四架，擊毀十一架。</p>
<p>里斯本九日中央社電　據關島來電，美太平洋艦隊司令部八日發表謂，最近襲擊先島列島時之英團航空母艦三艘，曾爲日軍特攻隊擊中</p>
<h3>受冲繩戰役教訓力避本土登陸戰　敵愼重進行次期戰準備</h3>
<p>東京九日中央社電　冲繩戰役敵人於戰術上之失敗旣重且大，敵軍當局亦曾忠實承認，自冲繩戰局轉變後，敵即繼續準備次期作戰，而其次期作戰之準備，其進行愼重異常，由敵對日木土之航空攻擊及敵空軍之動向即可明瞭。</p>
<p>對日本土航空攻擊</p>
<p>敵受戰役之敎訓後，力避直接本土登陸作戰，而企圖先使日本土孤立，且化爲焦土後，再行本土決戰，亦即使馬里亞納，硫黃島，冲繩各基地羣之空軍取得緊密連絡後，再取下列攻勢：　澈底轟炸日本土基地羣，藉以消滅特攻機之威力，　攻擊日中小都市，澈底破壞生產設施，並消滅國民戰意，　投擲機雷與嚴加哨戒重要輸送路綫，以遮斷海上交通，　遮斷陸上安通，切斷本土與大陸及南方之連絡，加强對日對鎖，摧毀本土戰力，現敵機攻擊本土之情形，可知敵欲以最小犧牲，收獲最大效果，此種愼重手段，足以表現敵在避免再踏冲繩戰後之覆轍。敵空軍之動向，據敵空軍日來之行動，即可明瞭敵業於菲律賓，馬里亞納，硫黃島，冲繩等地設立對日包幽基地，在硫黃島現有P51型機約二百數十架，馬里亞納有B29型約九百至一千架，冲繩有大中小型機合計約九百架，菲律賓有第五，第十三航空隊合計二千數百架，復企圖加强其實力，欲將可能動員之主力軍勢力，儘量調集於各地，以期本土決戰獲勝。</p>
<p>最近敵方空軍動向</p>
<p>最近敵空軍之動向如次：　印度基地之N29第五十八轟炸隊，與馬里亞納基地之B29合併用於對日作戰，　調杜立特之第八航空隊於太平洋戰城，參加作戰，　美陸軍於太平洋新設以史巴茲爲司令官之戰略轟炸隊，而將杜立特所率第八航空隊及魯美指揮之第二十航空矇，置其產下，　在重慶新設以魏阿德爲司令官之美軍戰術司令部。綜視上述各點，可知敵於本土登陸作戰之先，企圖展開基地推進作戰，同時復可見敵於冲繩戰後之戰術失敗，對次期作戰影響頗大。</p>
<h3>峇厘巴板市　日軍民奮戰</h3>
<p>南方前綫基地九日中央社電　敵軍於峇厘巴板登陸以來，以重慶戰車爲先鋒，猛攻日軍陣地，然爲日守備隊之堅强防禦陣所阻，隨處遭受重創。自上月十五日敵軍開始艦砲射擊時，日軍某中國會員重要任務，離開峇厘巴板，最近歸返某基地，據談該方面日守備隊之勇戰情况如次：余由峇厘巴板出發，即該地首次受敵艦砲擊之翌日（六月十六日），常時日軍即開始應戰，即一般日僞亦於軍方指揮下，各盡其職，士氣旺盛，武功不　枚舉，且自村長以下原住民等，協力構築陣地多處，因此，兇敵登陸後，蒙受如此重創。當余由該地出發時，指揮官曾言，斷然死守該地，當地日僑，原住民等，與軍方結成一體，以自給自足之武器彈藥，勇戰不息，敵方雖有一萬至二萬之衆，亦無足長。</p>
<h3>日政府增設　新軍需工塲　豐田相訓勉新塲員工</h3>
<p>東京九日中央社電　日軍需工塲爲加强航空機增產，於本年四月起，官民全體一致，努力生產，自無待論，即對於工塲之防護疏散，地下工塲之設立等，亦均積極進行，其成績異常優良。日政府茲鑒於現下情勢，此次根據特定航空機工塲之緊急措置要綱，從新指定防空工塲，設立軍需工塲，豐田軍需相於九日對新工塲員工訓示，以期新工塲張力發展。</p>
<p>强力推進食糧增產</p>
<p>東京九日中央社電　日農商省　改組戰時食糧增產推進本部，並擴大其權限，積極進行增產計劃，今又成立戰時農業團，同時設定中央戰時食糧增產本部，併會戰時農業團及此次解散之農業報國會，以農商大臣爲本部長，以戰時農業團總裁爲副本部長，以謀中央與地方之密切連絡，積極指導國民義勇隊。農民隊之從事農務，並强力推進食糧之增產工作。</p>
<h3>對冲繩縣知事日內相授賞詞</h3>
<p>東京九日中央社電　日安部內相以此次日本土前衛之冲繩決戰之際，島田冲繩縣知事始終協力日軍，率領縣民奮鬥，忠誠可嘉，待授與賞詞，幷布告各地方總監府與道府縣應一體週知，期永顯彰其功績。按日大臣對於官更授與賞詞尚屬首次，此項賞詞最近將傳達福岡縣　內之石塲冲繩縣內政部長。</p>
<h3>史蒂威爾承認對日作戰困難</h3>
<p>瑞典京城九日中央社電　冲繩美聯社電稱，美國第十軍司令官史蒂威爾，七日對新聞記者團談稱，對日作戰，除目前之空中攻勢而外，日本本土·華北·滿洲各地，亦將展開戰鬥，其所談要旨如次：日本地形之險峻，不亞於冲繩，占領冲繩島尚需時三閱月，對日本土作戰，當爲更艱巨之長期戰鬥。又即使於其本土征服日軍，然日軍於滿洲仍有莫大之數字存在，日本土作戰終結後，美國究將採取若何政策，余雖不明瞭，但依個人之見解，決信征服日本後，仍須　續戰爭也。</p>
<h3>美駐法空軍　移調太平洋</h3>
<p>蘇黎世九日中央社電　據巴黎朮訊：美弟九航空隊六日命令第五十戰鬥機隊及三百五十八戰鬥機隊將兵，由法國基地移向哈佛港，而開始向太平洋前進。</p>
<h3>胡毓坤廣播</h3>
<p>南京九日中央社電　今（九）日爲國府參戰紀念日，軍委會總參謀長胡毓坤，特於是晚假中央廣播電台，以「總力奮起擊滅英美」爲題，對全國國民廣播。</p>
<p>地方通訊</p>
<h3>轟炸後之武漢</h3>
<p>— 康民</p>
<p>曾聽人說：「漢口市區遭轟炸後，　存的房屋很少了。」我觀光一下，才知道耳開不如目見，原先聽到的那些話不能　信。自然未必看不到一些被毀的殘跡，但是少數被破壤的又很迅速地建設起來，整個的都市仍舊繁榮着。</p>
<p>政治改進</p>
<p>自葉遜氏主政湖北以來，整頓政治，不遺餘力。對於復興武漢，實行「四整五變六不」政策。全漢人民，都引頸盼望着這個政策的實現，救民於水火。所謂四整工作，即：整破敗爲完善；整凌亂爲條理；整污穢爲淸潔；整虛設爲實用。五變政策：變複雜爲簡單；變曖昧爲光明；變私利爲公益；變鬆懈爲緊張；變混亂爲秩序。六不要求：不多層徵收；不强行徵發；不藉口派捐，不留難需索；不恐嚇敲詐；不寃苦好人。如果眞能憑此政策，脚踏實地去幹，我想人民復歸，市面繁榮，自是意料中事。</p>
<p>鄂省財政</p>
<p>軍興以還，旣難開源，而省方財政，更形据拮，收支不能平衡，於今更甚。今春湖北省政會議席上報告：整理田賦收入，改爲實物徵收後，預計年收最低額可得米約六十萬石，足够本年度之政府經費及軍營之薪餉津貼；並且預定以武漢附近各縣運供武漢員軍保警納賦食米中之一千五百石食米，配給市府員警，則今後武漢提高待遇後，對於警察之健全，定可法紀整肅，政治簡索。但顧如省長所說：以過去稅收月僅三百餘萬元，實難維持；今大加整頓後，庫收倍增。運用湖北全省之力，灌溉此華中已枯萎之花。</p>
<p>民生疾苦</p>
<p>在武漢，不單公務員的生活淸寒，平民的生活也很困苦。在生活綫上掙扎的人羣，終日忙碌着，他們的精神是堅苦的。平晨忙着趕市集，上辦公室，還有許多貧民榦着更辛苦的勞力生涯，還有許多掃鹽的平民，終日爲粒粒的鹽辛苦着，因爲那邊是缺少鹽的世界啊。上海的人們，憂心白米的高漲，他們則盼望有食鹽運來，一粒粒遺落在路上的鹽，會引起許多掃鹽者注視。人民仰洽着黑市鹽，這些混有塵埃的鹽，救濟了武漢人的淡食。在鹽荒聲中，老天爺不帮忙，米價也漲到十多萬了。</p>
<p>名勝古蹟</p>
<p>武昌黃鶴樓，瀕臨大江，登　武漢全市，長江景色，一覽無遺，可惜一部份已禁遊客眺望。抱冰堂所藏岡書，已存無幾。漢口郊外古德寺，建築仿印度古典，內供濟公，四大金剛諸佛。歸元寺在漢陽大別山西　，寺內香火頗盛，供有五百羅漢，娘娘殿，放生處等，寺外一帶，本極荒凉，現廟外曠地，均被商人佔領一空，攤販羅佈，熱鬧非凡。漢陽月湖之伯牙琴亳，本爲夏日納凉勝地，湖中荷　盛開，但現在無景可言，琴臺房屋簡陋不堪，均居難民在內。鸚鵡洲，十里坡等地，相傳均有古蹟，但現被湮沒無存，唯見我炎黃子孫，終日爲生活操勞而已。</p>
<p>敎育貧乏</p>
<p>武漢的敎育是貧乏的：自去年遭轟炸後，人力財力兩遭打擊。現在所有合併中小學，在此物力艱難之時，自難望有理想的成績，現當局正竭盡心力，設法維持。記者於某小學見到天眞的兒童，在頹垣殘壁的敎室中攻讀，屋頂被毀後蓋以蘆蓆，敎師仍敎學不倦，此種精神，誠可欽佩。蔡甸（離漢陽約六十里）省立某中學，有着多數學生，爲唯一安全區域。記者與一行將畢業的學生談話，他嘆息着這裏沒有一所可以更求深造的地方，說：除非到內地或上海去。</p>
<p>慈善事業</p>
<p>這裏的慈善事業不甚發達。礄口嘉請撤院，爲漢口僅存之托兒所。中老修女章德肋撒主持，三十多位半餓的老弱者，枯黃憔悴的臉，做着一切最輕便也很簡單的活計，嬰兒營養不足，一天只喝幾遍藕粉。這所慈善機關已有相當歷史了，從前養着二百多個孤兒，經費由公敎會供給，自停頓後，剩下幾個老修女勉任其難，一直維持到現在，一頓飯兩頓玉蜀黍薄粥還難供給。記者看到一位八十多歲的白髮女人，聽說是第一個進院的孤兒，現在到底病了，很安靜地睡着，她們今後的生活，誠不堪設想呢。</p>
<h3>岡村大將　披瀝作戰决意　昨招待首都宣傳要員</h3>
<p>南京九日中央社電　日本駐華派遣軍總司令官岡村大將，於九日下午三時在中山北路南京偕行社，招待首都宣傳報道當局，計到有宣傳部孫次長·武司長·吳司長·中央社郭社長·胡副社長·巾央日報江副社長·閔總編輯。中報社張代社長。王總編輯等十餘人，岡村大將特親自招待，雙方款待至爲融洽。岡村大將首對目前一般戰局，闡述極詳，後復披瀝日大陸派遣軍作戰之決心，直至下午五時始散。</p>
<h3>今後調整郵資須經政院通過</h3>
<p>南京九日中央社電　郵政總局駐滬辦事處，於上月間要求建設部當局，准予調整郵資，同時幷鑒於以往甫經實行增加，即因物價上漲，又須調整，郵員工生活與郵資，因此特擬具郵資增加附加費暫行辦法，呈請建設部核准實施。該辦法係適應各地之米價收取郵資附加費，擬定每月調整一次。頃悉建部以該項辦法實施，諸多困難，一因各地之米價，參差不齊，如此郵資寄費勢必難以抑平，二因每月按黑市物價之增加而遞增郵資，則必循環刺激，而影響物價之上漲，三因郵政爲國營公用事業，所以便利民衆者，如此則加重國民負担，於理不合，因此送未予批准。開今後如郵資增加，亦須呈部由行政院通過方准實行。</p>
<h3>中央黨部週會</h3>
<p>南京九日中央社電　中國國民黨中央黨部，今晨十時在該部大禮堂舉行第二五七次總理紀念週，到中央執監委，各廳部會工作同志，政府機關國民黨黨員六百餘人，由戴副秘書長策主席，行禮如儀後，民衆訓練部王副部長敏中報告「關於民訓工作之原則」，嗣舉行參戰紀念儀式，至十一時許禮成散會。</p>
<h3>發動黨員　協助滅蝗</h3>
<p>南京九日中央社電　中央民衆訓練部梅部長，因鑒於鎭江及本京燕子磯等地，仍有蝗蝻爲患，爲救濟農作物迅速減蝗起見，特分電江蘇省黨部及南京特別市黨部，尅速督飭當地黨部發動黨員，協助政府下鄕撲滅，以免成災。</p>
<h3>挪威對日宣戰</h3>
<p>里斯本九日中央社電　據倫敦廣播：挪成政府六日已正式對日本宣戰。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>戰時道德與戰時經濟</h3>
<p>今日我們所深刻焦慮的，不僅是經濟問題的複雜與困難，幷且是道德觀念的颓廢與墮落。譬如這幾天米價又在逐漸回漲了，我們試分析其原因：固然因爲各地的存米數量並不十分豐富，然而主要的還是下列兩點，第一，米糧移動限制雖然撤廢，但沿途敲詐勒索尙有存在；第二，有錢的人趁此機會，紛紛往四鄉購米，旣不惜重價，並就地囤積，於是以人爲的力量，限制了米糧的來源，提高了米糧的價格。這兩者都不外是從利己心出發的。</p>
<p>又譬如因爲撥款單的濫發，貼現風潮的澎湃，財政金融當局固然命令撥款單停止使用，而一方面准許各行莊開發木票。可是，本票的本質，又何嘗不是一種變相的信用貨幣而已。假定各行莊以一紙本票，而換得實物或黃金，一日之間，於結算之前，便可利用空頭信用，操作「化無爲有」的循環把戲。試問如何可以檢査取締，在這種情形下，共流弊所及，不僅片面的信用貨幣膨脹，幷且或將造成整個經濟社會的紊亂。其流弊雖非當局創意之所能逆料，而要之則又出發於各行莊之利己心而已。</p>
<p>所以戰時經濟政策應該以戰時道德觀念爲基礎。不然，必然被人假借，滋生弊端。因此我們今日所深刻焦盧的，不僅是經濟問題的複雜與困難，幷且是道德觀念的颓廢與墮落。</p>
<p>最近聽到柬京來滬的人證起空襲下日本的生活情形，有一點足以使我們感動的，便是：戰時的經濟雖然比以前增加了許多困難，可是戰時的道始比以前更其增高。在空襲之下，或者有人的房屋燒了，有人受到了災難，而大家過着有無相通，出入互助的同甘共苦的生活。因爲到那時候，更能深切的認識，單是利己是沒有用的，有錢的可以一夜之間失掉了金錢的依靠，只有在互助互愛的精神下，火家一起盡其所能貢獻於國家。</p>
<p>現在上海的情形雖然沒有東京那樣的嚴重，可是我們應該認淸，一切利己的行爲，投機操縱的買賣，只能招致社會的不安，民生的危機，更應該覺悟，未雨綢繆只有今日，大家要拿出良知良能來，以戰時的道德來配合戰時的經濟。</p>
<p>有權力的不濫用權力，有金錢的不妄用金錢，都以道德爲基礎，然後戰時的經濟政策得以有效，戰時的民生問題差可安定。</p>
<h3>京東亞交通社辦理聯銀交換</h3>
<p>南京九日中央社電　南京東亞交通公社，爲便利旅客購換聯銀，特與中央儲備銀行商洽，於該社內設立辦事處，每日上午九時至下午三時辦理交換事務。其交換額與徐州所規定者同，頭二等可換聯銀九百元，合中儲劵五千元，三等換聯銀四百五十元，合中儲劵二千五百元。自十日起，華北行車票價開列如下：自南京至北平頭等十萬零一千九百元，快車七千二百元。二等五萬六千元，快車四千四百元。三等二萬七千元，快車二千二百元。</p>
<h3>粵褚省長宣誓就職</h3>
<p>廣州九日中央社電　新任褚省長民誼，於九日上午九時在省府大禮堂舉行宣誓就職典禮，由中央當局電派陳中委　君代表中央親臨監誓。</p>
<h3>渝參政會　開會第二日</h3>
<p>廣州九日中央社電　據重慶廣播：國民參政會八日上午八時舉行第二次會議，出席參政員一七六人，莫德惠主席。秘書處宣讀第一次會議紀錄及收出文件後，即由經濟部長兼戰時生產局長翁文灝報告經濟及戰時生產工作。翁氏首論經濟建設原則及重要法規，次論戰時生產之意義。</p>
<p>廣州九日中央社電　據重慶中央社訊：國民參政會第四屆第一次大會，業於七日上午開始舉行，由蔣介石訓詞後，復於下午繼續召開預備會。按此次會議以張伯苓·吳貽芳·李璜·王雲五·王世杰等七名爲主席團，分担各科委員會。預備會召開時，首由陳軍政部長報吿軍事狀態，繼有質詢約五十件左右，會議自召開日起，即異常緊張。此次參政會席上，當討論前六全大會政府强行推進憲政實施之問題，且渝方冀求於十一月十二日召集國民大會，其能否成功，亦繫於此次參政會席上之決定，故延安及第三勢力者，對其成果極爲注意。</p>
<p>渝美合作貌合神離</p>
<p>大陸九地基日中央社電　上月二十八日蔣介石會見記者團後，各外國特派員曾一致宣稱，蔣氏之用心異常周密。此次會見問答之中心題目，僅爲登陸作戰之一部，蔣氏深思熟慮之態度，乃在表示「不知美軍對於登陸作戰，究作如何打算」。蓋登陸作戰業成現實問題之今日，美軍當局仍不將其心腹之事告知渝方，因此爲登陸作戰對策而疲於奔命者，並非日軍，乃渝軍自身也。美國値此所謂對日總反攻之時，不但不與渝方緊密合作，旦今復對渝方取利用態度，此種利已之現實主義，殊不易强使蔣介石忍受。自去秋以迄今日，美國對華政策大致可分爲三階段：其第一期爲史蒂威爾所代表之高壓政策，藉口開通援蔣路綫，强令國共合作；第二期爲哈萊及韋特曼之國共合作工作失敗；第三期則轉換爲僅以蔣政權爲對手之現實主義。因美國之現實主義，使中國歷盡痛苦，蔣介石對此亦並米忘記，因於七月七日之參政會席上，曾謂美蔣之軍事協力雖已臻滿足之境，然於中國戰域摧毀敵人之重大事業，必須由我等自身實行云。蔣介石對美國可怖之現實主義深爲憂慮者，亦理可當然者。</p>
<h3>史太林宋子文　三度會談</h3>
<p>瑞典京城九日中央社電　據莫斯科報告稱：蘇聯戰長史太林於週六夜接見渝行政院長宋子文。</p>
<p>新疆問題謀取解决</p>
<p>瑞典京城九莫斯科電稱：宋子文抵莫斯科以來，曾與蘇聯政府首腦會面協議兩次，商討之內容雖尚不明，然一部消息靈通者認爲由於蒙古人民共和國總理喬伊巴爾孫相繼訪蘇一事觀之，兩者之間必有相當關聯。莫斯科路透社七日曾報稱如下，蘇兪兩國問之莫斯科會談情形，現頗不振，宋子文屢與蔣介石道電相商，並由於會議之內容次第通吿美英兩國政府一事觀之，即可窺知協議之主要內容，當爲聯合國協力渝方問題。惟莫斯科外交界則謂，喬伊巴爾孫訪蘇，與宋子文之使命全無關係。惟據英國週報遠東特派員之報道謂，宋子文訪蘇，實與新疆鑛業援助問題有關，其大意如次：新疆政府與蘇聯於一九四二年因國境問題發生紛爭之臻，該政府曾與渝方表示好感，是時蘇聯則突然停止鑛業援助，用示報復，因此過去數年問依賴鐵道與蘇聯通商之該省，遂蒙甚大打擊，及至二年前渝政機開發該省，蔣介石曾赴該省獎勵開發事業，然因無蘇聯之援助，難有成就，故此次乃命宋子文訪問，而與史太林協商檢討鑛業開發問題，並求其力予援助云。</p>
<h3>渝兵役署長　判處死刑</h3>
<p>中央社訊　據東慶廣播：前渝兵役署長無兵役幹部訓練班主任程澤　氏，因有違反兵役法幷濫用職權情事，由渝軍法總監部審訊後，業於六日處以死刑。</p>
<h3>英運蘇物資　五百萬噸</h3>
<p>里斯本九日中央社電　倫敦訊，英政府八日發表：截至四月底止。英國經波斯灣運往蘇聯之援助物資，計達五百餘萬噸，其中包括兵器·飛機·布疋。食糧。及蘇聯生產之工業設施與軍需品。</p>

<p>里斯本九日中央社電　據西雅圖電訊：美國波音飛機公司頃發表，該公司最近將於西雅圖工塲開始製造C97新型運輸機，據稱該機係B29型機改造而成。</p>
<h3>義承認波政府</h3>
<p>里斯本九日中央社電　據羅馬電：義大利政府八日發表，已決定承認波蘭統合政府。</p>
<h3>蘇擬利用德俘虜　協助戰後建設　將提出三頭會議討論</h3>
<p>蘇黎世九日中央社電　據倫敦訊英某報最近曾就蘇聯對德俘虜之意向，詳述如下：蘇聯爲再建木國，曾有使用四百萬德人俘虜之意圖，然德人俘虜大部目前均在聯合軍之手中，故今蘇聯當局要求英美二國，將俘處中之親衛隊，秘密警察隊，及納粹黨員，全部解送蘇聯。關於此項問題，恐爲將來三頭會議席上重要議題之一。</p>
<h3>審訊戰犯　暫行條例</h3>
<p>瑞典京城九日中央社電　據倫敦訊，英陸軍部昨日宣稱：關於審裁戰時罪犯及遠滬戰時法律者（例如苛待戰俘或佔領區居民等）之暫行條例，業經於某項特種軍令內規定，該項條例中所規定之一切手續，均須由英軍佔領區內之軍法處切實遵照，然此項佔領區內之軍法處，對於一般須經英京當局與其他各國政府協議後，方得以某種手續處裁之戰時犯罪案件，應不予受理。現關於上述之特種軍令，對一般英軍司令官均授與特權，俾能使彼等有權召開軍法處會議，直接審訊一切戰時罪犯，同時亦有權可將此項特種，轉授與下級司令官。目前對於一切戰時罪犯之審訊事宜，一待特權許可證頒發後，即將開始。關於一切懲罰種類如左：死刑，監禁，沒收產業·罰款·此末後兩項乃適用於依法追償故意毀損財產者。又有條例規定，若受判決者對所受處罰有不服時，可向上級機關提起上訴。</p>

<h3>調節民食與探講離糧　—民食調節委員陳彬龢談</h3>
<p>本市諮詢委員會爲採辦雜糧調節本市民食，特設「民食調節委員會」專責辨理，該會業已決定第一期採購雜糧辦法（見七月三日各報）並解答參加認購手續（見七月六日各報），頃承該會委員陳彬龢氏語記者，近日復接到各界來函詢問調節民食及採購雜糧之意義，除於前次解答外，茲再補充答覆如次；</p>
<p>調節民食治標為急</p>
<p>（問）爲調節民食而集國採講離糧，是否可以達到預期目的？（答）集團探講離糧，原細條節民食之治標一法，而治本辦法，還在米糧粉麥雜糧三者之綜合統制，惟有糧食之綜合統制，則對採辦資金·運輪·收買·配給等職權，均能一元化。在未能綜合統制以前，則集團採購雜糧，調節民食，實爲當前急務。蓋集國採購，對於資金　業，運輸安全，利潤減低等，均能合理解決。</p>
<p>（問）參加認購單位，在繳款時，不經審查，何從老核其是否合格？（答）復興銀行僅負收款責任，將來由民食調節委員會負責審查，如有朦蔽多認，投機取巧者，自當取銷認購權利。</p>
<p>運輪安全負責保證</p>
<p>（問）採購運輸安全責任，是否保證？（答）探講事宜，委託粉麥統委會代辦，自當員責保證。</p>
<p>（問）關於參加認購手續方面如有疑問，應向何處接洽？（答）參加辦法極爲簡單，早經公佈明白，事實上並無可疑之處，民食調節會僅爲諮詢會設立之臨時機構，並無辦事人員，如有公布辦法，隨時在報端路佈。</p>
<p>競講米糧　應加防範</p>
<p>（問）當局公佈米糧緊急措置後，米糧來源見暢，但近來米糧復趨上漲，其敞何在？（答）近來米價上漲，共原因自非一端，惟主要者在於一般有錢者乘機兢購，因而造成供過於求之局面。同時，在此靑黃不接之時，產米區存米原已薄弱，更不足供應競購之需要。因此，對於有錢者之只顧小我，而不顧政府施策一點，實有予以嚴密防範之必要。其次，爲減少米糧消耗，自須搭吃雜糧，而慈善團體等首先應全部改吃雜糧，一般市民對於糙米更無須碾白，因雜　與糙米，就營養價値而宮，實較白米爲佳也。</p>
<h3>行莊本票　已有偽造發現　銀錢業盼當局澈查</h3>
<p>本市銀錢兩業以前使用之撥款單，因偽造頗多，故而決意停止使用，一面並分由各銀行錢莊依照限制辦法愼重開發平行橫綫即期本票，以代撥款軍之流通。詎於本月三日起迄今甫及一週，而歹從僞造本票之事，業經發現，今後恦一任其演進，將有不堪設想之處。記者昨以此事分訪金融界人士探詢其意見，僉謂現在有人僞造本票尚屬絕無僅有之事，但星星之火，確可燎原，設不及早防患於未然，旣影響銀錢業信譽甚大，即對於妨害戰時金融亦屬至鉅，此銀錢兩業負責方面，對此事之發生極爲重視，其於僞本票之印刷紙張國章，開發日期，均予以慎重研究，務求短期內能予水落石出，此外並積極研討杜絕偽造之方法，並講求本票精密製造及開發之特徽。另一方面更希金融主管當局對於僞造嚴節拿辦以免貽害民衆。</p>
<p>規定提取現鈔辦法</p>
<p>本市銀錢業各行莊爲調劉市面現鈔需要，對於客戶之提用現鈔，均分別自行規定臨時辦法，所有甲等商業銀行，一律照客戶上週結存最低數額可提取現鈔百分之三十至二十。按即上週最低存款爲一百萬元者，本週可取現鈔二十萬元至三十萬元。至其他小型行莊最少亦叮提取百分之十。該項臨時辦法，昨（九）日起已多數照辦。</p>
<h3>金證券市況</h3>
<p>金證券昨日市况如下：到期券，三百三十九萬元，較上週六漲六萬元。第四期，三百五十萬元，較上週六漲三十四萬元。</p>
<h3>中儲增發　五千元新券</h3>
<p>中央儲備銀行爲調劑市面現鈔需要，昨日起發行三十四年版灰綠色五千元券一種，其正背兩面圖形花紋圖章簽字，均與該行前發之灰綠色五千元券相同，惟正面券號改印西文字母，此項灰綠色五千元券，與該行已發行之各種鈔券一律通用。</p>
<h3>保甲處修訂　更換戶長辦法　調整保甲行政手續費</h3>
<p>關於處理更換戶長辦法，業經本市警察局保甲處修訂如下：如戶長遷出本戶，而未辦移動手續，不為戶長之更換時，得由利書關係人之申請，經保甲長之證朋，得根據下列辦法，選派新戶長，執行戶長　務。　能證明有繼續承租　之人，得準起擔任新戶長。　能證明受原戶長之委任，得准其爲代理戶長。　戶長選出後，未有前兩項之人選，得由該戶內之附戶長中，推舉之掉換新戶長，爲保甲行政上之必要手續，並不影　於前後戶長及附戶間之法律上權利義務關係亦，或產權之證明。</p>
<p>本市警察局所屬各區分局所辦理之各種戶籍事宜，其請領居住證，移動出生死亡，　遣失居住證申請補領等保甲行政手續費，定於本月十六日起實施調整，其請領居往證移動出生，死亡報告等，每件一律改收一百元，遺失居住證由請補領者，每件改收五百元，華人外人同時實施。</p>

<h3>八期平價離糧　價目公佈</h3>
<p>本市第八期平價雜糧價月分類表，業由市離糧業同業公會，呈經經濟局核准公佈，自本月十日起至十二日止。茲將其價目分類表綠次：（門售五斤總價）崇明赤豆一一·○○○元，奔牛赤豆九·○○○元，南京赤豆九·○○○元，奔牛豇豆九·五○○元，南京虹豆八·五○○元，粉菉菉豆九·○○○元，普通陳　豆五·五○○元，苞米七·五○○元。</p>

<h3>Japanese Naval Escort Units Sink Six Enemy Submarines; British Aircraft Carriers Damaged During Raid on Sakishima Islands</h3>
<p>Naval Base, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) – U.S. forces have recently been making every effort to blockade Japanese ports and destroy maritime transportation by using B-29 aircraft to lay mines in key areas of the mainland. At the same time, numerous submarines are appearing in the southern regions and the seas off China. In order to ensure the security of transportation routes, the Japanese naval escort units have been attacking enemy submarines daily. From the beginning of June to the present, approximately one month, they have confirmed the sinking of six enemy submarines in the waters near the mainland. Air and sea forces continue to search for enemy submarines.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) – One hundred and fifty enemy P-51 aircraft attacked airfields in the Kanto region at 0:30 PM on the 8th. Japanese forces shot down four and destroyed eleven.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a dispatch from Guam, the U.S. Pacific Fleet Command announced on the 8th that three British aircraft carriers that recently attacked the Sakishima Islands were hit by Japanese special attack forces.</p>
<h3>Learning from the Lessons of the Okinawa Campaign, the Enemy Strives to Avoid Landing Operations on the Mainland; the Enemy Carefully Prepares for the Next Phase of the War</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The enemy’s tactical failures in the Okinawa campaign were serious and significant, and the enemy military authorities have honestly acknowledged this. Since the turning point in the Okinawa campaign, the enemy has continued to prepare for the next phase of the war, and their preparations are being carried out with exceptional caution. This is evident from the enemy's aerial attacks on the Japanese mainland and the movements of the enemy air force.</p>
<p>Aerial Attacks on the Japanese Mainland</p>
<p>Having learned from the lessons of the Okinawa campaign, the enemy is striving to avoid direct landing operations on the mainland. Instead, they intend to first isolate the Japanese mainland and turn it into scorched earth before engaging in a decisive battle. This involves establishing close communication between the air forces based in the Mariana Islands, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa, and then undertaking the following offensive: Thoroughly bombarding Japanese mainland air bases to eliminate the power of special attack aircraft; Attacking Japanese small and medium-sized cities to completely destroy production facilities and eliminate the national will to fight; Dropping mines and closely guarding important transportation routes to cut off maritime transportation; Severing land communication to cut off contact between the mainland and the continent and the southern regions, strengthening the blockade of Japan, and destroying the mainland's war-making capability. The current state of enemy aerial attacks on the mainland shows that the enemy wants to achieve the greatest effect with the least sacrifice. This cautious approach demonstrates the enemy's determination to avoid repeating the mistakes of the Okinawa campaign. The movements of the enemy air force indicate that the enemy has established bases encircling Japan in the Philippines, the Mariana Islands, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa. Iwo Jima currently has approximately 250 P-51 aircraft, the Mariana Islands have approximately 900 to 1,000 B-29 aircraft, Okinawa has approximately 900 large, medium, and small aircraft combined, and the Philippines has a total of 2,800 aircraft in the 5th and 13th Air Forces. They are also attempting to strengthen their forces and mobilize as much of their main force as possible in various locations in order to win the decisive battle on the mainland.</p>
<p>Recent Movements of the Enemy Air Force</p>
<p>The recent movements of the enemy air force are as follows: The N29 58th Bombardment Squadron from the Indian base is being combined with the B-29s from the Mariana Islands base for operations against Japan; The 8th Air Force, led by Doolittle, is being transferred to the Pacific theater to participate in operations; The U.S. Army has newly established a Strategic Bombardment Force in the Pacific, commanded by Spaatz, placing Doolittle's 8th Air Force and LeMay's 20th Air Force under its command; A U.S. military tactical command headquarters has been newly established in Chongqing, commanded by Wedemeyer. In summary, these points indicate that before landing operations on the mainland, the enemy intends to launch a base-advancing operation. At the same time, it is also clear that the tactical failures in the Okinawa campaign have had a significant impact on the next phase of the war.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military and Civilians Fight Resolutely in Balikpapan City</h3>
<p>Southern Front Base, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Since the enemy landed in Balikpapan, they have been using heavy tanks as a vanguard to attack the Japanese army's positions. However, they have been blocked by the strong defensive positions of the Japanese garrison and have suffered heavy losses everywhere. Since the enemy began naval bombardment on the 15th of last month, a certain Chinese member of the Japanese military with an important mission left Balikpapan. Recently, he returned to a certain base and spoke about the valiant fighting of the Japanese garrison as follows: I departed from Balikpapan on the day after the first enemy naval bombardment (June 16th). At that time, the Japanese army immediately began to fight back. Even the general Japanese and puppet forces, under military command, performed their duties, showing great morale. There are countless examples of military achievements. Moreover, from the village head downwards, the indigenous people cooperated in building numerous defensive positions. Therefore, after the fierce enemy landed, they suffered such heavy losses. When I departed from the area, the commander said that they would resolutely defend the area to the death. The local Japanese residents, indigenous people, and the military formed a united entity, bravely fighting with self-supplied weapons and ammunition. Even though the enemy has a force of 10,000 to 20,000, they are not to be feared.</p>
<h3>Japanese Government Establishes New Military Supply Factories; Minister Toyota Encourages New Factory Employees</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) – In order to strengthen the increased production of aircraft, Japanese military supply factories have been working together as one since April of this year, striving to produce. There is no need to discuss this. They are also actively carrying out the protection and dispersal of factories, the establishment of underground factories, etc., and their results are exceptionally good. The Japanese government, in view of the current situation, has newly designated air defense factories and established military supply factories based on the emergency measures outline for specific aircraft factories. Minister of Military Supplies Toyota gave instructions to the employees of the new factories on the 9th, in order to encourage the rapid development of the new factories.</p>
<p>Vigorously Promote Increased Food Production</p>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce reorganized the wartime food production promotion headquarters and expanded its authority to actively carry out the increased production plan. It has now also established a wartime agricultural corps. At the same time, it has established a central wartime food production headquarters, merging the wartime agricultural corps and the recently disbanded agricultural patriotic society. The Minister of Agriculture and Commerce will serve as the headquarters chief, and the president of the wartime agricultural corps will serve as the deputy headquarters chief, in order to achieve close communication between the central government and the local areas. They will actively guide the national volunteer corps and the farmer corps to engage in agricultural work and vigorously promote increased food production.</p>
<h3>Minister of Home Affairs Awards the Governor of Okinawa Prefecture</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Minister of Home Affairs Abe, recognizing that Governor Shimada of Okinawa Prefecture consistently cooperated with the Japanese military and led the prefectural people to fight bravely during the decisive battle on Okinawa, the vanguard of the Japanese mainland, and that his loyalty was commendable, has granted him an award and ordered that all local supervisory offices and prefectures be notified in order to permanently recognize his merits. It is reported that this is the first time a minister has awarded a subordinate official. The award will soon be delivered to Fukuoka Prefecture for Ishiba, the Okinawa Prefectural Minister of Internal Affairs, to receive on behalf of the Governor.</p>
<h3>Stilwell Acknowledges the Difficulty of Operations Against Japan</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) – An Associated Press dispatch from Okinawa stated that General Stilwell, commander of the U.S. Tenth Army, told a group of reporters on the 7th that in addition to the current aerial offensive, battles would also be fought in the Japanese mainland, North China, and Manchuria. The main points of his statement were as follows: The terrain of Japan is as difficult as that of Okinawa. It took three months to occupy Okinawa Island, and operations on the Japanese mainland will be even more arduous and long-term. Even if the Japanese army is conquered on its mainland, a large number of Japanese troops still exist in Manchuria. After the end of operations on the Japanese mainland, I do not know what policy the United States will adopt, but in my personal opinion, I firmly believe that war must continue even after the conquest of Japan.</p>
<h3>U.S. Air Force Stationed in France Transferred to the Pacific</h3>
<p>Zurich, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a dispatch from Paris, the U.S. Ninth Air Force ordered the soldiers of the 50th Fighter Squadron and the 358th Fighter Squadron on the 6th to move from French bases to Le Havre and begin advancing to the Pacific.</p>
<h3>Hu Yukun Broadcasts</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Today (the 9th) is the anniversary of the National Government's entry into the war. Hu Yukun, Chief of the General Staff of the Military Affairs Commission, gave a broadcast to the nation from the Central Broadcasting Station this evening, titled "Mobilize All Forces to Destroy Britain and the United States."</p>
<p>Local Correspondence</p>
<h3>Wuhan After the Bombing</h3>
<p>— Kang Min</p>
<p>I once heard someone say, "Very few houses remain in the urban area of Hankou after the bombing." After I visited, I realized that seeing is believing, and those words I heard before were not credible. Naturally, you can see some remnants of destruction, but the few that were damaged are quickly being rebuilt, and the entire city is still thriving.</p>
<p>Political Improvements</p>
<p>Since Ye Xun came to power in Hubei, he has spared no effort in reforming the government. To revitalize Wuhan, he implemented the "Four Consolidations, Five Transformations, and Six No's" policy. All the people of Wuhan are eagerly anticipating the realization of this policy to save them from their plight. The so-called "Four Consolidations" are: consolidating the dilapidated into the complete; consolidating the chaotic into the orderly; consolidating the filthy into the clean; consolidating the nominal into the practical. The "Five Transformations" are: transforming the complex into the simple; transforming the ambiguous into the clear; transforming private interests into public interests; transforming the lax into the tense; transforming the chaotic into the orderly. The "Six No's" require: no multiple levies; no forced requisitions; no raising money under false pretenses; no creating difficulties and making demands; no intimidation and extortion; no wronging good people. If this policy can truly be implemented practically, I believe that the people will return, and the market will prosper, as expected.</p>
<p>Hubei Province Finances</p>
<p>Since the start of the war, it has been difficult to increase revenue, and the province's finances have become even more strained, with income and expenses unable to balance. This is even worse now. At the Hubei Provincial Government meeting this spring, it was reported that after reorganizing land tax revenue and changing to in-kind collection, it is estimated that the minimum annual income will be about 600,000 shi of rice, enough for the government's expenses and military salaries for this year. It is also planned to allocate 1,500 shi of rice from the rice collected as taxes from the counties near Wuhan to supply the military police in Wuhan. In the future, with increased treatment in Wuhan, the police can be strengthened, and law and order can be improved, simplifying politics. However, as Governor Gu said, it is difficult to maintain with the past tax revenue of only more than three million yuan per month. Now, after major reorganization, the treasury revenue has doubled. The entire strength of Hubei Province is being used to irrigate this withered flower in Central China.</p>
<p>People's Suffering</p>
<p>In Wuhan, it is not only the civil servants who live in poverty, but also the common people. The people struggling on the poverty line are busy all day long, and their spirit is tenacious. They are busy rushing to the market, going to the office, and many poor people are engaged in even more arduous labor. There are also many people sweeping salt, working hard all day for every grain of salt, because it is a world where salt is scarce. The people of Shanghai are worried about the high price of rice, but they hope that salt will be transported in. Every grain of salt left on the road will attract the attention of many salt sweepers. The people rely on black market salt, and this salt mixed with dust saves the people of Wuhan from bland food. In the midst of the salt shortage, God does not help, and the price of rice has also risen to more than 100,000.</p>
<p>Famous Historical Sites</p>
<p>The Yellow Crane Tower in Wuchang overlooks the Yangtze River. From there, you can see the entire city of Wuhan and the scenery of the Yangtze River. Unfortunately, part of it is forbidden for tourists to look at. Very few of the books collected in the Baobing Hall remain. Gudesi Temple in the suburbs of Hankou is built in imitation of classical Indian style and enshrines Jigong, the Four Heavenly Kings, and Buddhas. Guiyuan Temple is located west of Dabie Mountain in Hanyang. The temple is very popular, and enshrines five hundred Arhats, the Niangniang Hall, the liberation pond, etc. The area outside the temple was originally very desolate, but now the open space outside the temple has been completely occupied by merchants, with stalls everywhere, making it very lively. Boyaqintai on Yuehu Lake in Hanyang was originally a popular summer retreat, with lotus flowers blooming in the lake, but now there is no scenery to speak of. The houses on the Qin Terrace are simple and dilapidated, and are inhabited by refugees. In places such as Yingwuzhou and Shilipo, it is said that there are historical sites, but they are now buried, and only the descendants of our Chinese nation are seen, working hard for their livelihoods all day long.</p>
<p>Educational Poverty</p>
<p>Education in Wuhan is poor: since the bombing last year, manpower and financial resources have suffered blows. Now all the merged primary and secondary schools, in this time of difficult material resources, cannot be expected to achieve ideal results. The authorities are now doing their best to try to maintain them. The reporter saw innocent children in a certain primary school studying in classrooms with dilapidated walls. After the roof was destroyed, it was covered with reed mats, and the teachers were still teaching tirelessly. This spirit is truly admirable. A certain provincial middle school in Caidian (about sixty miles from Hanyang) has a large number of students and is the only safe area. The reporter talked to a graduating student, who sighed that there was no place to pursue further studies here, and said: unless you go to the interior or Shanghai.</p>
<p>Charitable Work</p>
<p>Charitable work here is not very developed. The Qiaokou Jiaqing Nursery is the only remaining nursery in Hankou. Sister Zhang Delesa, an old nun, is in charge. More than thirty half-starved old and weak people, with their sallow and haggard faces, are doing all the lightest and simplest jobs. The infants are malnourished and only drink lotus root powder a few times a day. This charitable organization has a considerable history. In the past, it raised more than two hundred orphans, and the expenses were provided by the Catholic Church. Since the funding stopped, a few old nuns have been reluctantly doing their best to maintain it until now, and it is difficult to provide even two thin bowls of corn porridge for a meal. The reporter saw a white-haired woman in her eighties, said to be the first orphan admitted to the orphanage. She is now ill and sleeping very quietly. Their future life is truly unimaginable.</p>
<h3>General Okamura Pledges His Determination to Fight; Yesterday Hosted Key Propaganda Personnel in the Capital</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) – General Okamura, commander-in-chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Army in China, hosted officials from the propaganda and reporting agencies of the capital at the Nanjing Xiehang Society on Zhongshan North Road at 3:00 PM on the 9th. Those in attendance included Vice Minister Sun, Director Wu, Director Wu of the Propaganda Department, President Guo and Vice President Hu of the Central News Agency, Vice President Jiang and Editor-in-Chief Min of the Central Daily News, and Acting President Zhang and Editor-in-Chief Wang of the China News Agency, totaling more than ten people. General Okamura personally hosted the gathering, and the atmosphere was very harmonious. General Okamura first explained the general war situation in great detail, and then pledged the determination of the Japanese Expeditionary Army in mainland China to fight. The gathering ended at 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Future Adjustments to Postal Rates Must Be Approved by the Executive Yuan</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Shanghai office of the Directorate General of Posts requested the Ministry of Construction last month to be allowed to adjust postal rates. At the same time, in view of the fact that previous increases were implemented only to require adjustments again due to rising prices, affecting the lives of postal workers and postal rates, a temporary measure for postal rate surcharges was drafted and submitted to the Ministry of Construction for approval. This measure was to collect postal rate surcharges in accordance with rice prices in various regions, and it was planned to adjust them once a month. It is now understood that the Ministry of Construction believes that the implementation of this measure would be difficult for several reasons. First, rice prices vary greatly from region to region, so postal rates would inevitably be difficult to stabilize. Second, increasing postal rates monthly according to the increase in black market prices would inevitably stimulate a cycle and affect the rise in prices. Third, the postal service is a state-run public utility, and its purpose is to facilitate the public, so this would increase the burden on the people and would not be reasonable. Therefore, it was not approved. In the future, any increase in postal rates must be submitted to the Ministry and approved by the Executive Yuan before it can be implemented.</p>
<h3>Central Party Headquarters Weekly Meeting</h3>

<p>Lisbon, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a London broadcast: The Norwegian government officially declared war on Japan on the 6th.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Wartime Morality and Wartime Economy</h3>
<p>What deeply concerns us today is not only the complexity and difficulty of economic problems, but also the decline and degradation of moral values. For example, the price of rice has been gradually rising again these past few days. If we try to analyze the reasons, it is true that the amount of rice stored in various places is not very abundant, but the main reasons are the following two points: First, although the restrictions on the movement of rice have been lifted, extortion along the way still exists; second, people with money are taking this opportunity to go to the countryside to buy rice, paying high prices and hoarding it locally, thus limiting the source of rice and raising the price of rice through artificial means. Both of these stem from selfishness.</p>
<p>Also, for example, because of the rampant issuance of allocation orders and the surge in discounting, the financial authorities have ordered the suspension of allocation orders and, on the one hand, allowed various banks to issue wooden tickets. However, what is the essence of a bank note but a disguised form of credit money? Suppose each bank uses a piece of paper to exchange for physical goods or gold. In one day, before settlement, it can use empty credit to operate the trick of turning nothing into something. How can this be inspected and cracked down on? In this situation, the disadvantages are not only the one-sided expansion of credit money, but also the possible disruption of the entire economic society. Although the disadvantages are not what the authorities could have foreseen, they stem from the selfishness of various banks.</p>
<p>Therefore, wartime economic policies should be based on wartime moral values. Otherwise, they will inevitably be exploited, breeding malpractices. Therefore, what deeply concerns us today is not only the complexity and difficulty of economic problems, but also the decline and degradation of moral values.</p>
<p>Recently, people from Tokyo who came to Shanghai witnessed the living conditions in Japan under air raids. One thing that moved us was that although the wartime economy was more difficult than before, wartime morality was even higher than before. Under the air raids, some people's houses were burned, and some people suffered disasters, but everyone lived a life of sharing what they had and helping each other in times of need. Because at that time, people could more deeply realize that being selfish was useless. The rich could lose their reliance on money overnight. Only in the spirit of mutual assistance and love could everyone do their best to contribute to the country.</p>
<p>Although the situation in Shanghai is not as serious as in Tokyo, we should recognize that all selfish behavior and speculative transactions can only lead to social unrest and economic crisis. We should also realize that the time to prepare for a rainy day is now. Everyone should bring out their conscience and ability and use wartime morality to cooperate with the wartime economy.</p>
<p>Those with power should not abuse their power, and those with money should not misuse their money. Everything should be based on morality, so that wartime economic policies can be effective and the wartime livelihood problems can be stabilized.</p>
<h3>Nanjing East Asia Transportation Company Handles Joint Reserve Bank Exchange</h3>

<h3>Guangdong Governor Chu Sworn Into Office</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The newly appointed Governor Chu Minyi held a swearing-in ceremony at the Provincial Government Auditorium at 9:00 AM on the 9th. Commissioner Chen, appointed by the central authorities, attended the ceremony to supervise the oath-taking on behalf of the central government.</p>
<h3>The Chongqing Political Council: Second Day of Meeting</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, September 9th, Central News Agency: According to a Chongqing broadcast, the National Political Council held its second meeting at 8:00 AM on the 8th. 176 councilors were present, with Mo Dehui presiding. After the Secretariat read the minutes of the first meeting and the received documents, Weng Wenhao, Minister of Economic Affairs and concurrently Director of the Wartime Production Bureau, reported on economic and wartime production work. Weng first discussed the principles of economic construction and important regulations, followed by the significance of wartime production.</p>
<p>Guangzhou, September 9th, Central News Agency: According to a Chongqing Central News Agency dispatch: The first session of the Fourth National Political Council began on the morning of the 7th. After a speech by Chiang Kai-shek, a preparatory meeting was held in the afternoon. This meeting was presided over by a presidium of seven members, including Zhang Boling, Wu Yifang, Li Huang, Wang Yunwu, and Wang Shijie, who divided responsibilities for various committees. At the preparatory meeting, the Minister of Military Affairs, Chen, first reported on the military situation, followed by approximately fifty inquiries. The meeting has been unusually tense since its opening. A key issue for discussion at this Political Council session is the government's forceful promotion of constitutional implementation following the Sixth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang. Furthermore, Chongqing's hope to convene a National Assembly on November 12th, and whether this can succeed, hinges on the decisions made during this Political Council session. Consequently, Yan'an and the "Third Force" are paying close attention to its outcome.</p>
<p>US-Chongqing Cooperation: Discordant in Appearance</p>
<p>Inland, September 9th, Central News Agency: Following Chiang Kai-shek's meeting with a group of reporters on the 28th of last month, foreign correspondents unanimously declared that Chiang's intentions were exceptionally circumspect. The central topic of the Q&amp;A session was focused on the topic of landing operations. Chiang's deeply considered attitude was a way of expressing "uncertainty about the American military's plans for landing operations". As landing operations are now a present reality, the American military authorities still aren't sharing their confidential plans with Chongqing. Therefore, those preoccupied with formulating countermeasures to the landing operations are not the Japanese military, but Chongqing's own forces. At this time of what is called a "total counteroffensive" against Japan, the United States is not only failing to cooperate closely with Chongqing, but is now adopting an exploitative attitude toward Chongqing. This kind of self-serving realism is difficult for Chiang Kai-shek to accept. From last autumn until now, American policy toward China can be roughly divided into three stages: The first phase was the high-pressure policy represented by Stilwell, which used the excuse of opening supply lines to Chiang to force cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communists. The second phase was the failure of Hurley and Wedemeyer's work on Kuomintang-Communist cooperation. The third phase has shifted to a realism that deals only with the Chiang government. Because of American realism, China has endured much suffering, and Chiang Kai-shek has not forgotten this. Therefore, at the Political Council meeting on July 7th, he said that while military cooperation between the US and Chiang had reached a satisfactory level, the major task of destroying the enemy in the Chinese theater must be carried out by us. Chiang Kai-shek's deep concern about America's frightening realism is, of course, reasonable.</p>
<h3>Stalin and Song Ziwen Hold Third Meeting</h3>
<p>Stockholm, September 9th, Central News Agency: According to reports from Moscow, Soviet leader Stalin received Chongqing Executive Yuan President Song Ziwen on Saturday night.</p>
<p>Seeking a Solution to the Xinjiang Issue</p>
<p>Stockholm, September 9th, Moscow dispatch: Since Song Ziwen's arrival in Moscow, he has met with Soviet government leaders twice to discuss matters. Although the content of the discussions is not yet clear, some well-informed sources believe that it is related to the successive visits of Mongolian People's Republic Premier Choibalsan to the Soviet Union. Reuters Moscow reported on the 7th that the Moscow talks between the Soviet and Chongqing sides are not progressing well. It can be inferred that the main content of the agreement is the issue of the United Nations' cooperation with Chongqing, judging from Song Ziwen's repeated telegrams to Chiang Kai-shek for consultation and the gradual notification of the contents of the meeting to the US and British governments. However, Moscow diplomatic circles said that Choibalsan's visit to the Soviet Union is completely unrelated to Song Ziwen's mission. However, according to a report by the Far East correspondent of a British weekly, Song Ziwen's visit to the Soviet Union is actually related to the issue of mining assistance in Xinjiang, the gist of which is as follows: In 1942, when the Xinjiang government had disputes with the Soviet Union over border issues, the government expressed goodwill to Chongqing. At that time, the Soviet Union suddenly stopped mining assistance as retaliation. As a result, the province, which had relied on railways to trade with the Soviet Union for years, suffered a major blow. Two years ago, the Chongqing government began developing the province, and Chiang Kai-shek went to the province to encourage development, but without Soviet assistance, it was difficult to achieve success. Therefore, he ordered Song Ziwen to visit and discuss the mining development issue with Stalin, seeking his forceful assistance.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Military Service Director Sentenced to Death</h3>

<h3>Soviet Union Plans to Use German Prisoners of War to Assist in Post-War Reconstruction; Will Propose at the Three-Power Conference</h3>
<p>Zurich, September 9th, Central News Agency: According to a London dispatch, a certain British newspaper recently detailed the Soviet Union's intentions regarding German prisoners of war: In order to rebuild the country, the Soviet Union intends to use four million German prisoners of war. However, most of the German prisoners of war are currently in the hands of the Allied forces, so the Soviet authorities are now asking the US and British governments to transfer all members of the SS, the secret police, and Nazi Party members among the prisoners to the Soviet Union. This issue is likely to be one of the important topics on the agenda of the upcoming Three-Power Conference.</p>
<h3>Provisional Regulations for the Trial of War Criminals</h3>
<p>Stockholm, September 9th, Central News Agency: According to a London dispatch, the British War Office announced yesterday that provisional regulations regarding the trial of war criminals and violators of wartime laws (such as mistreatment of prisoners of war or residents of occupied areas) have been stipulated in a certain special military order. All procedures stipulated in the regulations must be strictly followed by the military courts in the British occupied areas. However, the military courts in these occupied areas should not accept cases of war crimes that must be handled in a certain way after being agreed upon by the British authorities and the governments of other countries. According to the special military order mentioned above, general British military commanders are granted special powers, so that they have the right to convene military court meetings to directly try all war criminals, and also have the right to transfer this special power to lower-level commanders. At present, the trial of all war criminals will begin after the special power of attorney is issued. The types of punishments are as follows: death penalty, imprisonment, confiscation of property, fines. The last two items apply to those who intentionally damage property. There are also regulations stipulating that if the convicted person is not satisfied with the punishment, they can appeal to a higher authority.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's 19th Air Defense Day Implemented Comprehensive Training; Relevant Chinese and Japanese Officials Visited Various Districts</h3>
<p>Yesterday (9th) was the 19th Air Defense Day. The Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters, following precedent, implemented various air defense drills. People throughout the city were in a state of air defense, and the mood was extremely tense. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Alarm Transmission</p>
<p>The alarm drill began at 1:30 PM. At the same time, alarm transmission drills were also implemented. Each air defense jurisdiction was supervised by its respective police precinct. Outstanding air defense team members were drawn from each Lianbao (joint guarantee unit) to form an alarm transmission liaison team. The director of the second section, based on the alarm issuance time, ordered the liaison team members to use bicycles and copper gongs to transmit alarms throughout the district to each Bao (guarantee unit). Then, the alarm transmission team members of each Bao used their voices to transmit the alarm to each road, street, and lane, and erected flag markers at key traffic points and prominent locations for identification. At 1:30 PM, the training preparatory alarm was issued. At 1:45 PM, the training alert alarm was issued. At 2:00 PM, the training air raid alarm was issued. Strict traffic control was implemented throughout the city. Personnel were dispatched to form traffic control squads to direct traffic. At 3:20 PM, the training air raid alarm was lifted. At 3:30 PM, the training alert alarm was lifted.</p>
<p>Light Control</p>
<p>From 8:30 PM to 9:30 PM was the training alert light control. From 9:30 PM to 10:30 PM was the training continuous air raid light control. During these two light control drills, police and Baojia personnel formed light control supervision squads, divided into groups to patrol each district, earnestly guiding and strictly implementing corrections. Furthermore, each police precinct dispatched two or three groups to implement vehicle light control throughout the city. The light control of small boats on the Huangpu River and Suzhou Creek was supervised and guided by the water police. At the same time, the Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters broadcast general information about light control via radio, and frequently corrected problem areas, urging residents in those areas to pay attention to improvements.</p>
<p>District-Specific Training</p>
<p>Official Inspections</p>
<p>Each district designated appropriate locations to implement comprehensive drills, all of which were implemented upon receiving radio broadcasts, assuming the implementation of comprehensive drills. Each precinct chief, along with the section chiefs, served as commanders, drawing outstanding air defense team members to guide the public in rescue, firefighting, bomb disposal, and shelter seeking drills. Traffic control was implemented in and around the training areas. At the same time, upon hearing the broadcast assuming preparation for a wave attack, air defense activities and timely evacuation exercises were repeatedly held. In particular, emergency evacuation drills were thoroughly implemented, guiding citizens to participate in the drills. Officials of all levels of relevant agencies also visited the various districts in three shifts. The first group included Chief of Staff Deng, Deputy Directors Man Du and Sugihara of the Police Bureau, who inspected the Laozha, Xincheng, and Jiangning districts. The second group included Defense Commander Yamaguchi, Police Defense Director Hiraoka, General Director Noguchi, and Police Chief Kobayashi, who inspected the Jing'an Temple, Huashan, Lujiawan, and North Sichuan Road districts. The third group included the commander of the Japanese Marine Corps in Shanghai, Tsukazaki, Fire Chief Tsukazaki, and Advisor Ide Kiyomi, who inspected the Tilanqiao, Yangshupu, Huangpu, Hongkou, and West Hongkou districts. In their inspections, they all convened police and Baojia personnel for exhortations, offering many words of encouragement.</p>
<p>Local Training</p>
<p>This local comprehensive training was held in the Tilanqiao, Yulin Road, and Yu district areas. The above four districts were designated as air defense jurisdictions. Each precinct chief designated appropriate locations to direct Baojia personnel and the entire district's residents to implement major comprehensive air defense drills such as rescue, firefighting, bomb disposal, and emergency evacuation. All were held in the morning, and thorough traffic control was implemented at the training locations. Military and police authorities and officials of all levels visited for inspections. Chinese, Japanese, and foreign Baojia personnel, as well as people of various nationalities, worked together as one, cooperating in exercises, and the results were quite satisfactory. In the afternoon, each district still implemented comprehensive drills and strict light control and traffic control according to the city's air defense plan.</p>
<p>Cleanup Work</p>
<p>Each district cleaned and tidied up the air defense bunkers and wells yesterday morning, supervised by the police precincts and Baojia personnel. At the same time, the fourth team of the Police Bureau's Police Corps carried out model adjustment work on the air defense trenches on the main roads. Regarding the established air defense sites with obstacles, precinct chiefs abolished those that the Air Defense Headquarters had not agreed were reasonably located. Each Baojia also inspected and tidied up air defense equipment.</p>
<p>Emergency Evacuation</p>
<p>At 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon, the Laozha district held a large-scale emergency evacuation drill in the basement of the Great World department store. Police Bureau Deputy Director Watanabe Masami personally visited for inspection. Precinct Chief Xu Minchou, Deputy Precinct Chief Imamura Hiko, and First Inspection District Chief Inspector Rong Hanyi and other officials also attended the inspection. At 2:00 PM, as soon as the siren sounded, the emergency evacuation began. Customers and male and female employees in the department store were guided by the department store's air defense team to evacuate to the basement emergency shelter. At the same time, more than one hundred men, women, old and young people selected from each Bao, pretending to be passers-by, wore identity cards with their names, ages, native places, and addresses. They were guided by ropes and fences from the surrounding doors, with Baojia personnel maintaining order, guiding them into the shelter, and simulating heavy smoke, with everyone covering their mouths and noses with wool cloths and towels. The shelter was surrounded by posts to maintain order, and white flags with red horizontal stripes were used to guide them. In a very short time, the shelter was filled with more than a thousand people, and the mood was extremely tense. Deputy Director Watanabe visited the underground shelter before the drill ended. At the same time, other districts also conducted similar large-scale emergency evacuation drills.</p>
<p>In addition, the Shanghai Waterworks Company on Xizang Road and Beijing Road conducted a fire drill at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Fire engines from the Fire Department were dispatched, and the simulation was quite realistic.</p>
<h3>Regulating People's Food and Procuring Miscellaneous Grains: A Discussion with Chen Binhe, Member of the People's Food Regulation Committee</h3>
<p>The Municipal Advisory Committee has established a "People's Food Regulation Committee" specifically to procure miscellaneous grains to regulate the city's food supply. The committee has already decided on the first phase of procurement methods for miscellaneous grains (see various newspapers of July 3rd) and answered questions about participation in the purchase procedures (see various newspapers of July 6th). Recently, Chen Binhe, a member of the committee, told reporters that they have received letters from all walks of life inquiring about the meaning of regulating people's food and procuring miscellaneous grains. In addition to the previous answers, here is a supplementary response:</p>
<p>Regulating People's Food is a Temporary Solution</p>
<p>(Question) Can the collective procurement of miscellaneous grains to regulate people's food achieve the expected goal? (Answer) Collective procurement of miscellaneous grains is originally a temporary solution to regulate people's food. The fundamental solution lies in the comprehensive control of rice, flour, wheat, and miscellaneous grains. Only with comprehensive control of food can the powers of procuring funds, transportation, purchase, and distribution be unified. Before comprehensive control is possible, collective procurement of miscellaneous grains to regulate people's food is an urgent task. Collective procurement can reasonably solve problems such as procuring funds, transportation safety, and reducing profits.</p>
<p>(Question) When participating units pay, there is no review, so how can it be verified whether they are qualified? (Answer) The Fuxing Bank is only responsible for collecting payments. The People's Food Regulation Committee will be responsible for reviewing them in the future. Those who conceal information, purchase excessive amounts, or engage in speculation will have their purchase rights revoked.</p>
<p>Responsible for Guaranteeing Transportation Safety</p>
<p>(Question) Is the responsibility for procurement and transportation safety guaranteed? (Answer) The procurement matters are entrusted to the Flour and Wheat Control Committee, which will naturally be responsible for guaranteeing them.</p>
<p>(Question) Where should one contact if there are questions regarding participation in the purchase procedures? (Answer) The participation methods are extremely simple and have already been announced clearly. In fact, there is nothing questionable about them. The People's Food Regulation Committee is only a temporary organization established by the Advisory Committee and has no staff. If there are announcements of methods, they will be announced in the newspapers at any time.</p>
<p>Precautions Should Be Taken Against Speculative Rice Purchases</p>
<p>(Question) After the authorities announced the emergency measures for rice and grain, the source of rice and grain became smooth, but recently the price of rice and grain has been rising again. Why is this? (Answer) There are many reasons for the recent rise in rice prices, but the main reason is that some wealthy people are taking the opportunity to purchase speculatively, thus creating a situation of supply exceeding demand. At the same time, at this time of the year when the new harvest is not yet available, the rice reserves in rice-producing areas are already weak and insufficient to meet the needs of speculative purchases. Therefore, it is necessary to strictly guard against the selfishness of wealthy people who only care about themselves and disregard government policies. Secondly, in order to reduce rice and grain consumption, it is necessary to consume more miscellaneous grains. Charitable organizations should first switch to eating miscellaneous grains completely. The general public should not need to grind brown rice into white rice, because miscellaneous grains and brown rice are actually better than white rice in terms of nutritional value.</p>
<h3>Forged Bank Drafts Discovered; Banking Industry Hopes Authorities Will Investigate Thoroughly</h3>
<p>The city's banking industry used to use remittance slips, but because there were many forgeries, they decided to stop using them. At the same time, each bank and money shop carefully issued parallel horizontal line immediate drafts in accordance with the restriction methods to replace the circulation of remittance slips. However, only one week after the drafts were in use since the 3rd of this month, forgeries have been discovered. If this is allowed to continue, the consequences will be unimaginable. Yesterday, reporters interviewed people in the financial sector about this matter to inquire about their opinions. Everyone said that someone forging drafts is still a rare occurrence, but a single spark can start a prairie fire. If precautions are not taken early, the reputation of the banking industry will be greatly affected, and it will also be extremely detrimental to hindering wartime finance. The responsible parties in the banking industry attach great importance to the occurrence of this matter. They are conducting careful research on the printing paper, national emblem, and issuance date of the forged drafts, and are determined to get to the bottom of the matter in the short term. In addition, they are actively studying methods to prevent forgery and are studying the precise manufacturing and issuance characteristics of the drafts. On the other hand, they also hope that the financial authorities will strictly investigate and handle the forgeries to avoid harming the public.</p>
<p>Regulations on Withdrawing Cash</p>
<p>In order to regulate the cash needs of the market, each bank and money shop in the city has separately formulated temporary measures for customers to withdraw cash. All Class A commercial banks can withdraw 30% to 20% of the lowest balance of the customer's account from the previous week. That is, if the lowest deposit last week was one million yuan, 200,000 to 300,000 yuan in cash can be withdrawn this week. At least 10% can be withdrawn from other small banks and money shops. Most of these temporary measures were implemented starting yesterday (9th).</p>
<h3>Gold and Securities Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Yesterday's market conditions for gold and securities were as follows: Expiring bonds, 3.39 million yuan, up 60,000 yuan from last Saturday. Fourth term, 3.5 million yuan, up 340,000 yuan from last Saturday.</p>
<h3>Central Reserve Bank Issues New 5,000 Yuan Notes</h3>
<p>In order to adjust the city's cash needs, the Central Reserve Bank issued a new 1945 edition gray-green 5,000 yuan note yesterday. The patterns, designs, seals, and signatures on the front and back of the note are the same as the gray-green 5,000 yuan notes previously issued by the bank, but the serial number on the front of the note is printed with Western letters.

<h3>Baojia Office Revises Methods for Replacing Heads of Households; Adjusts Baojia Administrative Fees</h3>
<p>Regarding the handling of methods for replacing heads of households, the Baojia Office of the Municipal Police Bureau has revised them as follows: If the head of the household moves out of the household and has not completed the move procedure, when the head of the household is not replaced, the new head of household can be selected to perform the duties of the head of household based on the following methods upon application by a interested party and proof by the Baojia chief. Those who can prove that they have continued to lease the house are allowed to serve as the new head of household. Those who can prove that they have been entrusted by the original head of household are allowed to be the acting head of household. If the head of household is selected and there are no candidates for the first two items, the new head of household can be selected from among the deputy heads of the household. This is a necessary procedure for Baojia administration and does not affect the legal rights and obligations between the former and subsequent heads of household and deputy household heads, nor does it affect proof of property rights.</p>
<p>The Baojia administrative fees for various household registration matters handled by the district bureaus under the Municipal Police Bureau, such as applying for a residence certificate, moving, birth, death, and applying for a replacement of a lost residence certificate, will be adjusted starting on the 16th of this month. The fee for applying for a residence certificate, reporting a move, birth, or death will be uniformly changed to 100 yuan per item. The fee for applying for a replacement of a lost residence certificate will be changed to 500 yuan per item. The changes will be implemented for both Chinese and foreigners at the same time.</p>

<h3>Minutes of the Second Friendship Meeting of the Newspaper's Free Education Committee: Reviewing General Issues of Free Schools</h3>
<p>The Free Education Committee of this newspaper held its second friendship meeting at Xiangxue Garden, No. 990 Taishan Road, on the afternoon of the 7th. More than 30 people attended, including all committee members and teachers from the 1st to 10th free schools. First, the principals of each school successively reported on the actual teaching situation, the reasons for student absenteeism, and the situation of student family visits. They all said that the students of the free schools lived in extreme hardship, often not having enough to eat every day, which affected their health and nutrition. Some were also engaged in small businesses, hard labor, or apprenticeships, and some had returned to their hometowns. Therefore, absenteeism had become an unavoidable matter and a general phenomenon in all schools. Next, the supervisors reported that the teachers and instructors of each school were conscientious, and the students were quite able to abide by the school rules, even better than ordinary elementary schools. They also raised various practical issues and exchanged opinions. Finally, committee member Mr. Shen Baiying answered various difficult points regarding combined-grade teaching in detail. The meeting adjourned at about 6:00 PM. This meeting was grateful for the Hongqiao Sanatorium for lending the dining hall and Xiangxue Garden for providing refreshments at half price. This is hereby acknowledged.</p>
