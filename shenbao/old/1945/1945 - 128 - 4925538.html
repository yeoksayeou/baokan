<h3>冲繩島南部地區激戰日軍施猛烈反擊周圍敵艦船績擊沉毀五艘</h3>
<p>東京七日中央社電　冲繩本島南部地區日軍陸上部隊，為呼應日特攻隊對該島周圍敵機動部隊及艦船羣連續猛攻，對反復來製之敵軍加以痛烈反擊，至六日晨已恢復原有態勢，然至是日下午二時許，敵復接近日軍陣地，正與該方面日軍激戰。敵軍攻擊之重點，目下為西海岸方面，現在敵軍之第一綫為運接小波津，幸地南方前地南方中間之綫，所有日軍航空部隊，仍繼續攻擊敵北中兩機塲，五日夜北中兩機塲各有四處起火。又日軍特攻隊仍繼續對敵艦羣加以攻擊，收獲莫大戰果。</p>
<p>南方前綫七日中央社電　冲繩本島自陸戰開始以來，日軍予敵以大量出血，當初面臨日軍陣地之敵有第二十四兵團之第九十六師團，第七師團及第二十七師團，而今則僅存第七師團矣。其他則已調遣前在慶良間列島與周圍島嶼登陸之第二十四兵團之第七十七師團及北部方面之海兵第一師團接替。又來襲本島敵機架數一日為二百三十架，二日為三十七架，三日為一百九十架，四日為一百八十架，五日為二百三十架，六日一百五十架，其攻擊極為低調。</p>
<p>南西羣島基地七日中央社電　日航空部隊賡續對冲繩本島敵航空基地及四周敵艦船施以攻擊，自五日至六日，主要目標轟炸水飛機塲，有二十五處發生大火，在慶良間海面，有特設空母一艘起火後沉沒，艦型不詳者二艘起火，此外並可從陸上望見火柱四條。六日在嘉手納灣　沉艦型不詳者一艘，另一艘擊中魚雷。</p>
<h3>日特攻機奇襲收獲大戰果　伊平屋西方展開空戰</h3>
<p>前綫基地七日中央社電　日軍於四日後發動航空總攻擊後，伊奈少尉及　島少尉指揮之振武隊某機，由中山少尉誘導，六日拂　由基地出發，敵基地航空兵力，一二日來已見激戰，二日根據日方之偵察，北機塲有大型機六架，小型機八十一架，中飛機塲小型機六十架。五日北機塲大型，小型機數僅四十架，中機塲之小型機亦不多。冲繩周圍敵艦船羣，在嘉手納海面，中城灣，系滿海面三處，依然布陣，遭日特攻隊之强襲，時行躱避，已無作戰當初之積極性。六日日特攻隊之出擊，乘此良，痛擊驕敵，特攻隊中山機以正確航法，避免敵之電波探知，奇製成功，上午八時三十四分基地接到電報謂，抵達目標上空，九時十分十秒後即行突入，想已收得大戰果矣。</p>
<p>日軍前綫基地七日中央社電　日陸軍特攻隊振武隊，四日指曉總攻擊時，　陸軍最新銳戰鬥機「疾風」担任直接掩護工作之某戰鬥機隊東條隊長機及丸子軍曹機，在伊平羣島西方海面遇敵機數十架，擊落其一架，又擊毀一架。該兩成任務後飛返基地，據談當時特攻機　撞攻擊情况稱：所駕飛機於四日上午〇時〇分到達伊平屋島西方戰塲上空，向下望見敵戰艦以及巡洋艦五艘，驅逐艦十二三艘往來遊弋，有似屬戰艦之大型艦一艘冒起大火柱二條，巳陷於不能航行狀態。停留於海上，似屬驅逐艦者一艘以及其他五艘亦火勢甚熾，在其附近海面，停有飛艇一架，從事救濟工作。</p>

<h3>安南改變國名</h3>
<p>順化七日中央社電　安南帝國新內閣四月十六日成立，本月四日召開第一次閣議，國旗為全黃色，國歌亦於日內決定。</p>
<h3>台灣前日空襲神社被投彈　大分鹿兒島先後被襲</h3>
<p>台北七日中央社電　六日未明敵美機來襲，於島民尊崇之台灣神社投彈，實為污辱神域之表示，幸僅燒去拜殿之一部，本殿則安無無恙。又是日下午十一時四十分許，敵轟炸機約一九五架，戰鬥機二十餘架，以台北，台南為主，一部來襲台中，於機塲，都市部落投彈後，即向南方遁去。</p>
<p>台北七日中央社電　五日白晝，菲島基地戰鬥機轟炸機混合編隊約八十架，主要者襲台中，新竹地區，一部份來襲台南，台北地區，以機槍掃射飛機塲，都市，村落，車站等處，下午三時後向南方逸去，日方受損輕微。</p>
<p>福岡七日中央社電　七日上午八時許，馬里亞納基地之B29敵機約三十架，分成二梯團，經四國南端，從豐後水道侵入大分地區航空基地。另有約三十架分三梯團，從大隅·薩摩兩半島及志布志灣浸入鹿兒島地區航空要地，均於九時許向東南方海面逸去，日方損失輕微。日陸·海協助之制空部隊，在想豫海峽上空將其邀擊，僅以日陸軍機戰果言，巳證實擊落敵機六架（其中一架為M曹長撞落者）。關於海軍機戰果，刻正在調查，預料戰果亦相當多數。又敵機主力在未侵入鹿兒島縣前，七架侵入種子島，似未曾段彈。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>正義的呼聲</h3>
<p>——譽應東鄉外相聲明</p>
<p>日本東鄉外相　於本月六日，就德國國內軍總司令希姆萊對英美媾和，杜尼資元帥對華聲明繼續抗戰等事態，闡明日本對德外交的嚴正態度，實為目前國際政治上正義的呼聲。</p>
<p>就日德義三國協定而論，成立於大東亞戰爭爆發後三天之一九四一年十二月十一日，該約第一條規定：「日德義三國對於英美所强迫之戰爭，應以其所有一切强力手段，予以遂行，直至勝利為止。」第二條規定：「日德義三國在未經互相完全諒解之前，對於英美之無論任何一方，槪不休戰或媾和。」第三條規定：「三國於戰爭完成後，亦須密切協力，以樹立一九四〇年九月二十七日三國條約所規定之公正新秩序。」在這三條中巳經明確規定德國應取之態度。但是，目前德國在希特勒元首逝世之後。國內軍總司令希姆萊竟向英美乞降。同時，杜尼資元帥於就任後即表示對蘇聯續作戰，而對英美則僅以不妨害對蘇戰爭，即可妥協。以一國元首而公然有此表示，且與希姆萊行為相同，完全違反日德義三國協定，更與日本對蘇中立政策相背。因此，東鄉外相自不能不有嚴正的聲明。</p>
<p>由於這次德國當局違反三國協定的消息，不禁使人回憶三年以前的德蘇關係。當此次歐洲大戰燭發以前，蘇聯曾提倡集體安全體制，不斷和英法等國進行外交談判，但是英法毫無誠意；蘇聯為適應當時情勢，乃進而與德國締結條約，在一九二九年八月二十三日成立德蘇不侵犯條約。當時全世界都為之震驚，認為德蘇兩國合作之後；帝國主義的舊秩序將崩潰了。同時，德國亦因有此對蘇條約，始得順利完成對歐洲各國的閃擊戰，使歐洲帝國主義勢力猶如摧枯拉朽趨於崩潰。當時日蘇中立條約之成立，德蘇不侵犯條約實為其重要助因。假使國不於一九四一年六月二址二日對蘇進攻，而長軀西進，則鄧扣克之後，英倫三島可指日而下，美國當時尙漫無凖備，（這是美國自認的），當然無法援英，那時以日德義蘇四國領導而推翻帝國主義的舊體制，建立世界新秩序，决不只是一種理想。不意六·二二之戰鑄成大借，使英美獲得從容備戰的時間，而致世界戰局持久及擴大。</p>
<p>現在不幸德國又復違背三國協定，誠足令人太息。但是邦東鄉外相及時宣示堅定之立塲，使世界視聽為之一新。我們熱烈贊同東鄉外相的聲明。第一，德國雖終於背約，但實際上對日本政府完遂大東亞防衛戰之決意，毫無影響；第二，德國違約行為一經證實，則日本可以基於新觀點而獲得行動的自由，以完遂日本及東亞民族共同的理想。我們東亞全體民族，當然毫無猶欵，堅定信心，協力盟邦，完遂大東亞戰爭之目的。</p>
<h3>冲繩日軍把握殲滅敵人神機　松島部長在記者例會談話</h3>
<p>明邦駐華艦隊報道部於七日下午二時舉行報道常會，到松島部長及各報記者等十餘人，由松島部長報吿太平洋戰局，歐洲戰况及舊金山會議之危機，茲誌其談話大要如次：</p>
<h3>敵兵損失廿五萬人</h3>
<p>冲繩島方面自五月初以來，敵我兩方展開激烈交戰，日軍由五月四日起以新態勢從陸海空三方面轉向猛烈攻勢。敵方從西方起以第二十七第九十六第七十三個師團對那霸與那原一帶攻擊，惟中間第九十六師團巳遭殲滅打擊。敵遂由北方調海軍第六及陸軍第七十七師團加入九十六師團作戰，亦遭嚴重打擊。截至五月二日止，敵陸上損失據其發表在一萬四千以上。同時對日本本土攻擊及冲繩島周圍作戰之損失，為一萬一千四百十三名。敵發表損失數目合計二萬五千餘名。根據過去敵方發表宣傳佼倆，以十分之一作為計算標凖。則此次敵方之損失，至少有二十五萬人以上。以日本陸海空部隊及特攻隊之攻擊，至五月二日止，敵被擊沉破的艦艇共五百二十艘。</p>
<h3>冲繩敵軍腹背受敵</h3>
<p>尙有過去在硫黃島及塞班島所不僅見之情形發生，即據敵五月四日發表：即據敵五月四日發表：日軍三千名以戰車二十輛，於四日黑夜由東西兩面登陸，向敵九十六及七千七兩師團正面開始衝鋒，敵軍在前後腹背遭受日軍攻擊之下，敵方該稱正於五日晨將背後日軍擊退。在冲繩島周圍之敵艦艇，隨時損毀，時時減少。至五月六日止，該處一帶所剩之敵艦艇，只有特航母二艘，戰艦四艘，巡艦十隻，此項船隊攻擊之下，遂連續不斷的有火柱發生，即敵艦艇隨時發生損害。日航隊封中部兩岸附近東·中·部飛機塲之敵航空兵力，亦予以相當之打擊。在冲繩島戰塲來襲之敵機，較以前累計遞減，以前常有五百架左右，至五月六日止已減至八十架矣。現冲繩作戰日方已操確實把握之動權，無論制空權操日軍之手，並握有殲滅敵人之神機。故今後日軍攻擊愈激烈，冲島敵人之殲滅，為期愈近，冲繩島有名「波布」之毒蛇一種性極毒，敵方受害者甚衆。前在日鹿兒島管轄時，每年日人受傷者約萬人以上。該毒蛇可入地，能爬樹，宛似日本本陸上部隊及航空部隊，此次與日軍並行予敵人以莫犬苦惱。</p>
<h3>兩路德軍繼續抵抗</h3>
<p>歐洲方面，自希特勒英雄戰死以筆，敵即宣傳德軍已降服，據吾人判斷，尙未至此時機。德軍北部有杜尼資將軍，南方有凱錫林將軍，現在捷克斯夫西南國境展開勇猛作戰。在捷克斯拉夫西南國境，德軍尙有廿五個師團以上，據敵方宣傳亦稱可抵抗三個星期以上。尤令人注意者，在易北河兩邊英美軍有一百萬，蘇聯軍四百萬，此種兵力之不平均，無論政治上有任何條件，定將形成戰略問題，如立刻將兵力移至東方絕不可能。萬一德軍完全停止作戰，英美軍究有多少兵力移到太平洋上來很成問題，亦即實現的時間，還在很遠的將來。</p>
<h3>美蘇關係日益緊迫</h3>
<p>舊金山會議之危機，美國務卿史蒂汀留斯為波蘭問題與莫洛托夫正面衝突，美蘇衝突，已形擴大。據五月五日史蒂汀留斯之廣播，波流亡政權要人十六名在莫斯科被捕，其理由如何，應先加以淸楚解釋。史氏以此激動莫洛托夫。此項問題，不特表現舊金山會議將來之暗雲濃厚，亦且促使美蘇關係之緊迫。</p>
<p>歐洲食糧問題極為嚴重，其嚴重情形遠較德軍降服為甚。據五月四日美外國經濟局長佛萊勒發表談話，在歐洲國民有二億至三億為維持生存，必須發給食糧，但此種食糧僅能支持三個月，美為補充食糧由美本土，澳洲加拿大，向歐洲輸送，重要補給者只限於美軍及其同盟國之軍民，但德國市民由除外。此種問題將演成一饑餓戰綫，為一嚴重之社會問題，亦可促成第三次世界大戰之危機。</p>
<h3>杜尼資令德海軍　停止戰鬥行為　挪境德軍無條件投降</h3>
<p>瑞典京城六日中央社電　德元首杜尼資於六日夜利用廣播，發出特別布吿稱：列入停戰協定之全部水域內德艦艇，應立即停止一切戰鬥行為，嚴禁自沉或使艦艇不能使用等一切措置。</p>

<p>日內瓦七日中央社電　據巴黎反軸心公布：反軸心軍已進入奧地利北部多腦河上之林茲城。</p>
<h3>德軍十五萬向加軍投降</h3>
<p>蘇黎世六日中央社電　據巴黎電：五日加拿大第一軍司令布克斯與紐布拉斯哥維基元帥問，關於荷蘭西部德軍投降之交涉業巳商定，故阿姆斯特丹等各市區之德軍共計十二萬，巳全部向加拿大軍投降。同時依據上項協定，加拿大軍特定於七人兩日分別將該市佔頒。鳥克蘭第二軍司令希蒙資，向德第八十六軍司令休特洛貝大將亦曾提出同樣交涉，結果其所轄德軍已完全投降。</p>
<p>瑞典京城七日中央社電　據獲自加拿大軍司令部之公報稱：恩登·威海姆斯哈芬·及弗里雪恩羣島三地之德軍約三萬名，已於上週末夜在離奧爾敦堡附近之地點，實行向加軍投降，德軍指揮官斯特洛貝已與加軍司令雪夢茲，簽訂無條件投降協定</p>
<h3>美軍入捷境佔領比爾森</h3>
<p>瑞典京城七日中央社電　在過去二十四小時內，歐洲兩大京城普拉格及哥本哈根，乃為歐戰之目光集中地。傳普拉格方面，正與德軍進行談判，使其和平交出其行政權於捷克政府，目前敵對行動已吿停止。捷克秘密運動份子突然發動，德軍即採取迅速之行動，於是捷克電台遂急呼號反軸心之援助，趕往救助之巴頓第三軍，巳於捷克西疆通過小馬奇諾防綫，深入捷境三十七公里。又傳美軍已佔領比爾森（捷軍火工業要城）而向普拉格方面推進二十公里。丹京亦發生戰事，但穿着制服之丹人奉新政府之命開始搜捕親德份子，中午英軍一百七十五名自空中降陸，開進城內，即被德軍略加抵抗，當羣衆企圖侵犯停泊於港口之德艦時，德艦即行開火，三宮週圍之戰事特別嚴重，王宮之瓦頂被砲火所傷。德駐丹公使布斯特，亦被丹自由委員會所捕。</p>
<h3>希特勒別墅猶在燃燒中</h3>
<p>瑞典京城七日中央社電　據此間接獲美方公報稱：貝許特斯伽登之希特勒山中別墅，已被美第七軍佔領，當美軍入內時，彼等發現該別墅內之一切設施，均已受炸彈之爆炸而毀壞，樓板及洋臺等猶於濃烟中炸燒，大部室內之地板已破壞不堪。</p>

<h3>今後的美國國內問題</h3>
<p>在舊金山會議舉行前不久，羅斯福突然以腦充血逝世。他在美國政治外交上所佔的地位極重要，其影響所及，不得不謂强大深刻而久遠。其影響的深刻程度，對內對外自有差異，而其影響的表面化，自需相當時日。羅斯福在美國史上不可掩沒的功績，即是「團結國民」，此為南北戰爭以來，不，美國建國以來所想做而未果的，這由「合衆國」一詞也可明其意義。在這個基礎上，羅斯福造留在美國外交上的足跡，可歸納為兩點，即撤底强化隱藏於門戶開放。機會均等名下的干涉東亞主義，以及根本推翻對歐政策的傳統孤立主義。這可說是不絕追求市塲和利潤的美國資本主義所要求的政策。美國所走的路綫，雖因指導者的個牲不同而紆迴曲折，但其大體的方向，與羅斯福的在不在，是沒有關係的，因為它早已決定了。</p>
<p>滿洲事變以後，一九三二年的大總統選舉戰中胡佛敗下陣來，而以不承認政策知名的史汀生對日外交謠傳行將轉換時，羅斯福突然登台了，並與史汀生作長時間的協議，結果聲明全面沿襲其政策的旨趣。這表示美國資本主義所要求的對日政策，不問是民主黨也好，是共和黨也好，都是一樣的。這個事實，並不是山滿洲事變纔顯露出來的，在可稱為孤立主義一頂點的第一次世界大戰以後威爾遜的末期，美國上院拒絕批准凡爾賽條約時，早就出現了。至於美國上院反對該條約的一個焦點，即為山東問題。蓋因威爾遜在媾和會議席上對日讓步，所以美國上院便拒絕批准和約了。</p>
<h3>孤立主義的崩潰</h3>
<p>總之，干涉外交·侵略外交乃是美國　平洋政策的傳統，但使此發展到武力戰爭，囬是在打倒對歐關係上的孤立主義時是不可能的。此事的成功，從美帝國主義的立塲看，乃是羅斯福巨大的貢獻。在資本希望越過國境向世界伸展時，即在經濟上不得不取國際主義時，當然不能再在政治上執着孤立主義，所以孤立主義的崩潰，縱然有賴於羅斯福的努力，而其路綫總是美國資本主義所要求的。</p>
<p>不過，羅斯福的個性，在對英蘇關係上發生很大的作用，則是不可否定的事實。就中如美國的對蘇關係，仰止國內囂張的反對論而承認蘇聯的，便是羅斯福；去年大總統選舉時，克里姆林方面也公然支持了他。羅斯福故後，美蘇關係如何，雖然不容輕易預斷，但特別微妙的是：美國國內情勢不會影響到美蘇關係嗎？</p>
<h3>新政推行的結果</h3>
<p>羅斯福的國內政策，眞可目為　期的措置者，即斷定失業為社會全體的責任。此推翻了視失業為個人怠惰之果的淸敎主義傳統，而羅斯福就是根據這種新的社會觀來實行其稱為「新政」的一連串的政策。他能打破美國的傳統而連任四次，主要理由並不是所謂收買投票，也不是猶太人的陰謀，而是勤勞大衆擁護新政策的結果，這怕是不得不率直承認的。但在這裏也有資本家方面反對的根據。</p>
<p>在去年的選舉中，副總統華萊斯退職，而另選特魯曼，即為企圖緩和財界方面反對新政策的甞試。假為羅斯福預知今日會死，那末他盡可能留住勇敢而忠於新政的華萊斯了。現在，與財界有密切關係的特魯曼，巳照憲法的規定而就任大總統了，閣員方而，新政派亦有孤城落月之觀。於此就存有美國今後最大的問題。</p>
<p>即在新政策之下，羅斯福為牽制華爾街財閥起見，為便於獲得羣衆起見，曾努力鼓吹自由主義，因而勞動組合急劇發展，對政府，議會，財界形同敵國。至此便有問題來了。在新政策育成的自由主義的旗幟下，勤勞大衆開始考慮民主政治應該如何的問題。人民戰綫的世界風潮，尤其是德蘇開戰以後大衆間親蘇熱的勃興，更促進了這個大勢。</p>
<h3>特魯曼何去何從</h3>
<p>羅斯福死後，財界色彩濃厚的特魯曼內閣將如何領導這批羣衆呢？今日，美國正舉國如狂，追求勝利之夢，燃起了對有色人種的憎惡，在這戰時興奮中，或許沒有什麼困難。然而一談判到戰後問題，或隨蘇聯對美工作的進步，美國國內相尅的兩階級將如何反應呢？這是將來的問題，也是最微妙的事情。（朝日新聞社前紐約特派員森恭三）（譯自四月十四日朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>金證劵準備金指定專庫存儲銀錢業暨市民購券踴躍</h3>
<p>金證券於七日發行後，銀錢同業暨一般市民前往購取者，倍形踴躍。聞中央儲備銀行於七日·八日·九日將金證券發行後，即依據此三日間發行總數，將同額之準備金黃金全額，交付發行準備金管理委員會保管，以備到期兌付，而管理委員會對於該項黃金，另設專庫存儲，以明管理責任。幷聞擬指定銀行聯合準備委員會之金庫，爲存儲備該項準備金之專庫。</p>
<p>經濟界感想</p>
<p>中央儲備銀行發行之金證劵，已於七日起至九日止，按照最近巿情公定每兩七十八萬之價格掛牌出售。中央社記者昨走訪經濟界某鉅子，叩以對於中儲此次發行金證劵之感稱過去兩年以來，上海充斥游資，失於正當投資之途，乃輾轉購囤物資，而流入內地農村之一部資金，因內地農民在上海不能購得適用商品，致內地資金無法流回上海，是以上海遭囤積物資之惡風，造成物價繼續高漲，貨物成本益高，資金　碼更感不敷週轉，中儲雖極力設法調劑資金，增加通貨籌碼，但需要仍感困難，投機現象應運而生，加以局勢之演變，影響整個金融不安定，中儲此次奉准發行金證劵，主要目的爲維持通貨之價値，緊縮通貨，抑平物價，增強戰時經濟力，實爲適時良策。金證劵旣有十足之準備金，而准許人民以金證劵自由冒賣，誠爲一般擁資者另闢投資途徑，當爲社會金融實業各界所擁護。七日市塲情形益見穩定，不獨　赤股票均趨盤旋平復，即各種物價，亦有趨低之勢</p>

<h3>上海都巿交通公司</h3>
<p>— 家熙</p>
<p>—上海公用事業解剖之二—</p>
<p>種類繁多之懲罰法</p>
<p>公司的懲罰辦法很多，主要的有如下數種：</p>
<p>開除：在工廠行政中開除處分要算頂重！可是在電車公司服務無論那一件細微的事，都有被開除的危險，有時竟成百的開除，其原因大多數是爲了「揩油」。戰後電車路程縮短，乘等激增，往往短程乘容沒給錢就下車，也有因太擠不及買票，這都認爲是「漏票」，是蓄意「揩油」，因此也有過失，售票因認爲「揩油」致被停職而氣憤投浦的事也發生過。</p>
<p>罰鈔：賣票差不多一個人每月總有幾次被罰，司機和其他各部份的工人比較少些。爲了減少處罰，也有私下納鍰賣罪的。</p>
<p>革班頭：在服務中犯了某種過失，如爲揩油，漏票，錯票或者與乘客衝突等，公司就革幾天班頭不許上工，這樣除了沒有工資並且每天還要到公司裏等待，一直到派做班頭爲止。革班頭的時間，由三四天到十來天不等，公司裏工人喊這種處罰呌寫字間「擺帽子」，因爲沒有帽子就不准上班。</p>
<p>扣米：自從有了配給米以後就又添了這種罰則，凡是賣票員有揩油，漏票，錯票等情形，或査票放進沒有買票的人進車，就停止了這個月米的配給。爲了米·查票和賣票就不得不認眞工作了。</p>
<p>這四種懲罰形式沒有規定和限度，被處以什麽形式的處罰完全看「運氣」。在機務部停職罰款等事較少。但工作却較前者加重。</p>
<p>內外職工工作時間</p>
<p>從前車務部工人工作時間約九小時，並且分早班中班和晚班，也有只叫做早晚班的。電車改爲早晚開車後，工人也還是每天只做一班，但從本年四月一日起已改爲全天工作。電車有軌二路·五路﹔無軌廿一路，十六路，廿四路是從赫德路廠開出。有軌七路，八路，一路是從匯山碼頭開出。平常都是六點鐘，到十一點鐘回廠，下午三時再開出，八時多回廠。星期日六點四十五分出廠，十二時停，下午二時開，八時停。最近二路及七路又改爲全日行駛。在表面上看，車務部工人工作時間就有十多小時，但實際上却是十二小時乃至十三小時。因爲派往工作地點之預備，及往返接班落班之損失時間，每日平均需兩小時以上。比如早班六點鐘往卡德路接班或往靜安寺，匯山碼頭接班，以公司所在地爲出發點（因爲每天要至公司打印子報到），到目的地需要差不多三十分鐘時間，所以接班者在六時前巳達到目的地，即實際上在五點多已預備出發，到十一時落班，下午三時接班直到晚上八時落班。以此推算，每大往返損失的時間當在兩時半以上。星期日中午十二時停，下午二時問，由於往返時間所耗太多，實際上吃飯的工夫都沒有。另一方面假如司機賣票遲到數分鐘，不僅當天不能上車，還要受罰錢處分，因此六時上班無異五時一刻已盡義務。共次賣票落班後更須結賬，交錢，領取車票，對票等項工作；開車也須騐看車輛，約損失三刻鐘，外勤職員如查票排車管　等也要另繕報告單，亦須消費二三刻鐘。再次，車子脫班，成不準時到站，也都要受重罰，現在路綫短，車子少，乘客擁擠，車子就慢起來，賣票的工作更加緊張，勞勤强度也增高了。機務部工作每天規定九小時，分日班，比車務部有規律，工作忙時便臨時延長自一二小時至三四小時，工資按時照給，打樣間修機小工也差不多。總賬房之結賬做票，鈔票管理人均爲九小時工作，其他各部高級職員，工作時問約六七小時。</p>
<p>職工生活一般情形</p>
<p>賣票「揩油」問題大半爲生活所迫使，新賣票則往往以手法不純熟而發生漏票，就得罰錢，所以賣票常常到發薪時所得工資不及半數。補救辦法，只有舞弊。近年公司對賣票弊問題，認眞制裁，並設立賣票亭，乘客預先購票後始可排隊依次登車﹔同時並舉行廄票調換彩票，以獎勵乘等保存而免轉流入賣票員之手。所以現在揩油的事，已經很少了。</p>
<p>開除，罰錢，革班頭，扣米，這是常有的事。七扣八扣後就陷於半失業半飢餓的生活中，個人的生活也難於維持，有家庭負担的，更不堪設想。一個工人總得負担幾個人的生活費，妻子及兩個三子女多是不能生產的，近來職工多把家眷送回鄕下，而自己一人蹲在上海，公司沒有工人補習學校或工人人子弟學校等文化敎育設業的根本很少。由於營養與居住衛生的簡陋和缺乏、疾病或傳染病更易於威脅他們。</p>
<p>工人婚姻多數是以媒妁之言，父母之命而結合，他們的配偶多是同鄉關係而來，由朋友介紹而同居者也不在少數。嗜好﹕睹傳是最普遍，嫖妓最近因工作家眷回鄕却又盛行起來，吃鴉片的在老車站有二十多人，新站工人是流氓，」其實祇是笑話，祇有極小一部分人才如此的。交際在先進國家中是一種正當奴樂，在這裏則當作解決生活問題的一種手段，地們的人情分子每月支出也很不少。</p>
<p>有三千多工人的公司，但沒有自己的醫院，俱樂部，圖書館，敎育機關，工人子弟學校，運動塲等的設備，於是跑大世界，逛公司，看機關佈景的大戯或電影，成爲他們枯燥生活的點輟。有志氣的，也喜歡打拳，看看話劇，讀讀書報的也有。休息，機務工人是按星期的，車務工人是輪流的。一般工人的習慣，休息日或工餘時間多喜歡睡覺，這是極度疲勞的必然結果。（完）</p>
<h3>盼巿民協力完成自警自衛使命顧保甲處長昨日廣播演說</h3>
<p>本市警察局保甲處長顧繼武，於七日下午九時半，假上海電台，向全巿民衆廣播，對於全市保甲工作，闡明綦多，講詞分誌如次：</p>
<p>巿政史上一個奇蹟</p>
<p>各位都是居住上海多年的市民，對於這裏生活環境，是最淸楚沒有，概而言之，是複雜與畸形。固然這種情形，不是一朝一夕形成的，但是我們要在這樣的環境中，創立有組織有紀律的保甲制度，誰也不能否認是一件艱鉅的工作。</p>
<p>當保甲初辦的時候，就有人說上海的保甲是不能推行的，可是幾年以來，經市民諸君及地方父老們的熱誠協力，已經具有一些規模了，而且與週遭環境奮鬥的結果，得到了若于成就，這一點或許可以說是上海市政史上奇蹟</p>
<p>重視實踐不尙空論</p>
<p>本人明保甲是一件艱難的工作，但是因爲受當局的付託，與個人的興趣，毅然與許多同志來担當這個任務。然而我們保甲處不過是市警察局的一個　屬部門，也即政府與人民問的連絡承轉機關，保甲事務的領導機關罷了，而本人亦猶如引騶之率，界與之夫而已。不問保甲工作究竟能推行至如何程度，對國家有多少貢獻，祗是不計成敗利鈍，抱定宗旨去幹。本人服務保甲，有一個理念，便是實踐多於空論，重視民衆的眞實訓練，養成優秀的人材，爲地方服務，推行完善的保甲制度，使他獻於國家民族的復興，分担保衛東亞的責任。所以我們分盡一分力，便是多一分貢獻。</p>
<p>時間空間不受限制</p>
<p>其次，我以為保甲工作是不受時間或空間的限制，不論中外人民求安居樂業的心是相同的，在現在這樣環境複雜的狀態中，願求安居樂業，惟有從目警自衛的保甲工作做起，所以我們祗問與人民自治自衛的原則符合不符合，應做不應做，在得到眞實確認之後，便抱着大無畏精神去幹，成敗毀譽在所下計。同時保甲處是市區推行保甲制度的中心機構，本人承乏保甲處長，實際上負了推行保甲的重任，所以對保甲工作計劃與促進，閭　治安的協力維持，以及解除民衆的疾苦等等，都是責無旁貸，一定要殫精竭慮的去幹。可是社會間的事，往往因爲太負責，太盡力，而招致不良的猜測，不過本人但求保甲工作，日漸進展，使民衆得到實益，決不存其他心念。換言之，祗求心安理得而已。</p>
<p>經費收支力求健全</p>
<p>關於保甲的經費問題，我們曾費盡了苦心，創立健全的辦法。收的方面，依照各區呈報的特戶舖尸正戶附戶發給相符的納費印花，所以全區應收多少經費都有正確統計，而每一區委員會向各戶收費時，都黏貼相當的印花，作爲憑證，而支的方面，除解二成至市區保甲委員會作全體性的設施之用外，都由各區自主。因爲每區的委員會由當地士紳耆宿爲委員，且分局長亦直接參加，所以絕無流弊，可以說是取之於民，用之於民，這是我們非常安心的。</p>
<p>更進一步協力巿政</p>
<p>最近因爲局參市長蒞任，以及羅秘書長兼任市區保甲委員會的委員長，對保甲工作有劃期的刷新、我們今後將更進一步協助推行市政，如公共衛生方面，希望市民本着保甲精神，自動協力衛生當局，使市容整理淸除，並利用保甲機構，普遍防疫，以撲滅危害市民的疫癘。市民的配給制度，今後將依據保甲區作爲配給區，有精密的統計，務使每一市民得到應得之配給物品，期無流弊。</p>
<p>目前局勢的緊迫，疏散人口已為當前急務，保甲處除積極恊力推行外，本人盼望不必要留居本巿的巿民與婦孺，到各該總聯保去登記，我們當設法車船盡力帮助，使其歸鄕</p>
<p>關於防空的重要性，想市民諸君均已充份瞭解，保甲是站在防空的前哨，希望市民平日隨時注意　火管制，及一切防空措置，不可以生命作為兒戲</p>
<p>保甲制度的推行，至今已經有了幾年的歷史，到目前為止，我們還不能達到如諸君所理想的境地，雖然由於人事上的牽制，法令章則的限制，我們爲了團結國民，訓練國民，達成復興國家民族，進而分擔保衛東亞的責任，不得不再接再厲，埋頭苦幹，盼望市民以熱情來協助我們，共同奮鬥，來完成我們自警自衛的使命。</p>

<h3>Fierce Battles in Southern Okinawa: Japanese Forces Launch Intense Counterattacks, Sinking or Destroying Five Enemy Warships Around the Island</h3>
<p>Tokyo, July 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – In the southern region of Okinawa Island, Japanese ground forces, in response to the intense and continuous attacks by Japanese special attack units against the enemy's mobile forces and fleet around the island, launched fierce counterattacks against the repeatedly assaulting enemy forces. By the morning of the 6th, they had restored their original positions. However, around 2:00 PM that afternoon, the enemy approached the Japanese positions again, and fierce battles ensued. The enemy's main point of attack is currently on the west coast, with the enemy's front line running from Uneko (運接) to Kobatsu (小波津), and the area between Maesato (前地) and Minamikata (南方中間). All Japanese air units are continuing to attack the enemy's northern and central airfields. On the night of the 5th, four fires broke out at each of the northern and central airfields. Furthermore, Japanese special attack units continue to attack the enemy fleet, achieving significant results.</p>
<p>Southern Front, July 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Since the start of the land battle on Okinawa Island, Japanese forces have inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy. Initially, the enemy facing the Japanese positions consisted of the 96th Division, the 7th Division, and the 27th Division of the 24th Army. Now, only the 7th Division remains. The others have been replaced by the 77th Division of the 24th Army, which had previously landed on the Kerama Islands and surrounding islands, and the 1st Marine Division from the northern area. The number of enemy aircraft attacking the island was 230 on the 1st, 37 on the 2nd, 190 on the 3rd, 180 on the 4th, 230 on the 5th, and 150 on the 6th, with their attacks being very subdued.</p>
<p>Southwestern Islands Base, July 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Japanese air units continue to attack enemy air bases and surrounding enemy warships on Okinawa Island. From the 5th to the 6th, the main targets were seaplane bases, where 25 large fires broke out. In the sea off Kerama, a special-purpose aircraft carrier caught fire and sank, and two other vessels of unknown type caught fire. In addition, four columns of fire could be seen from the land. On the 6th, one vessel of unknown type sank in Kadena Bay, and another was hit by a torpedo.</p>
<h3>Special Attack Planes Achieve Significant Results in Surprise Attack; Aerial Battle Unfolds West of Iheya Island</h3>
<p>Forward Base, July 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – After the Japanese military launched a general air offensive four days ago, a certain aircraft of the Shinbu unit commanded by Second Lieutenant Ina (伊奈) and Second Lieutenant Shima (　島), guided by Second Lieutenant Nakayama (中山), departed from the base at dawn on the 6th. The enemy's air power at the bases has seen fierce battles in the past one or two days. According to Japanese reconnaissance on the 2nd, the northern airfield had six large aircraft and 81 small aircraft, while the central airfield had 60 small aircraft. On the 5th, the northern airfield had only about 40 large and small aircraft, and the central airfield also had fewer small aircraft. The enemy fleet around Okinawa, stationed in Kadena Bay, Nakagusuku Bay, and Itoman Bay, is still deployed in these three locations. Subjected to intense attacks by Japanese special attack units, they are dodging and evading, lacking the aggressiveness they had at the beginning of the operation. Taking advantage of this opportunity, the Japanese special attack units launched an attack on the 6th, dealing a heavy blow to the arrogant enemy.

<h3>Taiwan Shrine Bombed in Airstrike Yesterday; Oita and Kagoshima Attacked Consecutively</h3>
<p>Taipei, July 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – In the early hours of the 6th, enemy American aircraft attacked and dropped bombs on the Taiwan Shrine, which is revered by the island's residents. This is an act of desecration of a sacred site. Fortunately, only part of the worship hall was burned, and the main hall remained unharmed. Also, around 11:40 PM that afternoon, approximately 195 enemy bombers and 20 fighter planes attacked mainly Taipei and Tainan. A portion attacked Taichung and bombed the airfield and urban areas before fleeing south.</p>
<p>Taipei, July 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – On the 5th, during the day, a mixed formation of approximately 80 fighters and bombers from Philippine bases mainly attacked the Taichung and Hsinchu areas, with a portion attacking the Tainan and Taipei areas.

<p>Fukuoka, July 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Around 8:00 AM on the 7th, approximately 30 B-29 enemy aircraft from the Mariana Islands base, divided into two groups, infiltrated the Oita area air base via the Bungo Channel from the southern end of Shikoku. Another approximately 30 aircraft, divided into three groups, infiltrated the Kagoshima area air base via the Osumi and Satsuma peninsulas and Shibushi Bay. All of them retreated to the southeastern sea around 9:00 AM. Japanese losses were light. The Japanese Army and Navy air defense units, in cooperation, intercepted them over the Iyo Sea. Speaking only of the results of the Japanese Army aircraft, six enemy aircraft have been confirmed to have been shot down (one of which was crashed by Sergeant M). The results of the Navy aircraft are currently being investigated, and it is expected that the results will also be quite numerous. Furthermore, before the main force of enemy aircraft infiltrated Kagoshima Prefecture, seven infiltrated Tanegashima, but it appears that they did not drop any bombs.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>A Voice of Justice</h3>
<p>-- In Praise of Foreign Minister Togo's Statement</p>
<p>Japanese Foreign Minister Togo, on the 6th of this month, clarified Japan's solemn attitude towards German diplomacy regarding the situations of Himmler, commander-in-chief of the German domestic army, seeking peace with Britain and the United States, and Marshal Donitz's declaration of continued resistance. This is truly a voice of justice in current international politics.</p>
<p>Regarding the Tripartite Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy, which was established on December 11, 1941, three days after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Article 1 stipulated: "Japan, Germany, and Italy shall pursue the war forced upon them by the United States and Britain with all their strength until victory." Article 2 stipulated: "Japan, Germany, and Italy shall not cease hostilities or make peace with either the United States or Britain without complete mutual understanding." Article 3 stipulated: "The three countries shall also cooperate closely after the completion of the war to establish the just new order stipulated in the Tripartite Pact of September 27, 1940." These three articles clearly stipulate the attitude that Germany should take. However, now that Germany is without Hitler, Himmler, the commander-in-chief of the domestic army, is begging Britain and the United States for surrender. At the same time, Marshal Donitz, after taking office, expressed his intention to continue fighting against the Soviet Union, while only seeking compromise with Britain and the United States to the extent that it does not hinder the war against the Soviet Union. As the head of state, to openly make such a statement, and to act in the same way as Himmler, is in complete violation of the Tripartite Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy, and is even contrary to Japan's policy of neutrality towards the Soviet Union. Therefore, Foreign Minister Togo cannot but make a solemn statement.</p>
<p>The news of the German authorities violating the Tripartite Pact brings to mind the relationship between Germany and the Soviet Union three years ago. Before the outbreak of the European War, the Soviet Union advocated a collective security system, constantly conducting diplomatic negotiations with Britain, France, and other countries. However, Britain and France lacked sincerity. In order to adapt to the situation at the time, the Soviet Union went on to conclude a treaty with Germany, establishing the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact on August 23, 1939. At the time, the whole world was shocked, believing that after cooperation between Germany and the Soviet Union, the old order of imperialism would collapse. At the same time, Germany was also able to smoothly complete the blitzkrieg against European countries thanks to this treaty with the Soviet Union, causing the power of European imperialism to collapse like a house of cards. At that time, the establishment of the Japanese-Soviet Neutrality Pact and the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact were important contributing factors. If Germany had not attacked the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941, but had marched westward, then the British Isles could have been taken after Dunkirk, and the United States was still unprepared at the time (this is what the United States admitted), and would certainly have been unable to aid Britain. At that time, with Japan, Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union leading the overthrow of the old imperialist system and establishing a new world order, it would not have been just an ideal. Unexpectedly, the June 22 war created a major turning point, giving Britain and the United States time to prepare for war at their leisure, leading to the prolongation and expansion of the world war.</p>
<p>Now, unfortunately, Germany has again violated the Tripartite Pact, which is truly regrettable. However, Foreign Minister Togo's timely declaration of a firm stance has refreshed the world's attention. We wholeheartedly support Foreign Minister Togo's statement. First, although Germany has ultimately broken its promise, it has no actual impact on the Japanese government's determination to complete the Greater East Asia Defense War. Second, once Germany's breach of contract has been proven, Japan can obtain freedom of action based on a new perspective to complete the common ideals of Japan and the East Asian nations. We, the entire East Asian nations, will of course, without hesitation, firmly believe, cooperate with the allied nations, and complete the purpose of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<h3>Japanese Forces in Okinawa Seize Divine Opportunity to Annihilate Enemy; Director Matsushima Speaks at Press Conference</h3>
<p>The Mingbang Fleet Press Department stationed in China held a regular press conference at 2:00 PM on the 7th, attended by Director Matsushima and more than ten reporters from various newspapers. Director Matsushima reported on the Pacific War situation, the European war situation, and the crisis of the San Francisco Conference. The main points of his speech are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Enemy Losses of 250,000 Men</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of May, fierce battles have unfolded on Okinawa Island. From May 4th, the Japanese army, with a new posture, launched a fierce offensive from land, sea, and air. The enemy, starting from the west, launched an attack with the 27th, 96th, and 73rd Divisions against the Naha and Naha area. However, the 96th Division in the middle has been annihilated. The enemy then transferred the 6th Naval Division and the 77th Army Division from the north to join the 96th Division in battle, but suffered serious blows. As of May 2nd, the enemy's land losses, according to their own announcement, were over 14,000. At the same time, the losses from attacks on the Japanese mainland and operations around Okinawa Island were 11,413 men. The total number of losses announced by the enemy is over 25,000 men. Based on past enemy propaganda, we can use one-tenth as a calculation standard. Therefore, the enemy's losses this time are at least over 250,000 men. With the attacks by the Japanese Army, Navy, Air Force, and Special Attack Forces, as of May 2nd, the enemy had a total of 520 warships sunk or damaged.</p>
<h3>Enemy Forces in Okinawa Attacked from Front and Rear</h3>
<p>There are also situations that were not only seen on Iwo Jima and Saipan, which are according to the enemy's May 4th announcement. Three thousand Japanese soldiers, with twenty tanks, landed from the east and west sides on the night of the 4th and began a frontal assault on the enemy's 96th and 77th Divisions. With the enemy forces being attacked from the front and rear, the enemy claimed that they had repelled the Japanese forces behind them on the morning of the 5th. The enemy warships around Okinawa Island are constantly being damaged and reduced in number. As of May 6th, the enemy warships remaining in that area only include two special aircraft carriers, four battleships, and ten cruisers. Under the attack of this fleet, columns of fire occur continuously, that is, the enemy warships are constantly being damaged. The Japanese Air Force has also inflicted considerable damage on the enemy's air power at the east, central and west airfields near the central two coasts. The number of enemy aircraft attacking the Okinawa battlefield has been decreasing compared to previous totals. Previously, there were often around 500 aircraft, but as of May 6th, it has been reduced to 80 aircraft. The Japanese side now has a solid grasp of the initiative in the Okinawa operation. Whether it is air superiority or the divine opportunity to annihilate the enemy, it is in the hands of the Japanese army. Therefore, the more intense the Japanese military's attack, the closer the day will be for the annihilation of the enemy on Okinawa Island. Okinawa Island has a kind of venomous snake called "Habu", which is extremely poisonous, and many enemy soldiers are victims of it. Previously, during the Japanese rule of Kagoshima, about 10,000 Japanese people were injured each year. This venomous snake can enter the ground and climb trees, just like the Japanese mainland ground forces and air force, and is giving the enemy unbearable suffering.</p>
<h3>Two Routes of German Forces Continue to Resist</h3>
<p>On the European front, since the heroic death of Hitler, the enemy has been propagating that the German army has surrendered. Based on our judgment, it is not yet at this point. General Donitz is in the north of the German army, and General Kesselring is in the south. They are currently engaged in fierce battles on the southwest border of Czechoslovakia. There are still more than 25 divisions of the German army in the southwest border of Czechoslovakia. According to enemy propaganda, they can also resist for more than three weeks. What is particularly noteworthy is that the British and American forces have one million troops on both sides of the Elbe River, and the Soviet army has four million troops. This uneven distribution of forces, regardless of any political conditions, will definitely form a strategic problem. It is absolutely impossible to immediately transfer the forces to the east. If the German army completely stops fighting, the question of how many British and American troops will be transferred to the Pacific is very problematic, that is, the time to realize this is still in the distant future.</p>
<h3>US-Soviet Relations Become Increasingly Tense</h3>
<p>At the San Francisco Conference, US Secretary of State Stettinius had a head-on clash with Molotov over the Polish issue, and the US-Soviet conflict has expanded. According to Stettinius's broadcast on May 5th, sixteen key figures of the Polish government-in-exile were arrested in Moscow. The reasons for this should be clearly explained first. Stettinius used this to agitate Molotov. This issue not only shows that the dark clouds over the future of the San Francisco Conference are thick, but also intensifies US-Soviet relations.</p>
<p>The European food problem is extremely serious, and its severity is far greater than the surrender of the German army. According to a statement issued on May 4th by Mr. Fowler, Director of the US Foreign Economic Administration, 200 to 300 million people in Europe must be provided with food to maintain their survival, but this food can only support them for three months. The United States is transporting food to Europe from the US mainland, Australia, and Canada to supplement the food supply. Important supplies are limited to the US military and the military and civilians of its allies, but German citizens are excluded. This issue will develop into a famine front and become a serious social problem, which may also lead to a third world war.</p>

<h3>US Troops Enter Czechoslovakia and Occupy Pilsen</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, July 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – In the past 24 hours, Prague and Copenhagen, the two major European capitals, have been the focus of attention in the European War. It is reported that in Prague, negotiations are underway with the German army to peacefully hand over its administrative power to the Czech government, and hostilities have now ceased. Czech underground activists suddenly launched an uprising, and the German army took swift action. The Czech radio station urgently called for Allied assistance, and Patton's Third Army, which was rushing to the rescue, passed through the Little Maginot Line on the western border of Czechoslovakia and penetrated 37 kilometers into Czechoslovakian territory. It is also reported that US troops have occupied Pilsen (an important city in the Czech military-industrial complex) and advanced 20 kilometers towards Prague. Fighting has also broken out in Copenhagen, but uniformed Danes have begun to search for pro-German elements on the orders of the new government. 175 British troops landed by air at noon and entered the city, only to encounter slight resistance from the German army. When the crowd attempted to invade German warships docked in the port, the German warships opened fire. The fighting around the Royal Palace was particularly fierce, and the roof tiles of the palace were damaged by artillery fire. The German Ambassador to Denmark, Mr. Best, has also been arrested by the Danish Freedom Council.</p>

<h3>Denmark and Italy Request to Participate in the San Francisco Conference</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The participating countries in the San Francisco Conference have reached 49.

<h3>Future Domestic Problems in the United States</h3>
<p>Shortly before the San Francisco Conference, Roosevelt suddenly passed away from a cerebral hemorrhage. His position in American politics and diplomacy was extremely important, and his influence was undeniably strong, profound, and far-reaching. The depth of his influence varied internally and externally, and its manifestation would take some time. Roosevelt's indelible achievement in American history was "national unity," something that had been desired but never achieved since the Civil War, or rather, since the founding of the United States. The meaning of the term "United States" also illustrates this. Based on this foundation, Roosevelt's footsteps in American diplomacy can be summarized into two points: thoroughly strengthening the interventionist Eastern Asia policy hidden under the guise of Open Door Policy and equal opportunity, and fundamentally overturning the traditional isolationist policy toward Europe. This can be said to be the policy demanded by American capitalism, which constantly pursues markets and profits. Although the path taken by the United States may be tortuous due to the different personalities of its leaders, its general direction is unrelated to whether Roosevelt is alive or not, because it has already been determined.</p>
<p>After the Manchurian Incident, Hoover was defeated in the 1932 presidential election, and when Stimson, known for his non-recognition policy, was rumored to be about to change his diplomatic approach to Japan, Roosevelt suddenly took the stage and held a long consultation with Stimson. As a result, he declared his intention to fully follow Stimson's policies. This shows that the policy toward Japan demanded by American capitalism is the same whether it is under the Democratic Party or the Republican Party. This fact was not only revealed by the Manchurian Incident. It had already appeared at the end of Wilson's term, after World War I, which can be called the pinnacle of isolationism, when the US Senate refused to ratify the Treaty of Versailles. One of the focal points of the US Senate's opposition to the treaty was the Shandong issue. Because Wilson made concessions to Japan at the peace conference, the US Senate refused to ratify the treaty.</p>
<h3>The Collapse of Isolationism</h3>
<p>In short, interventionist diplomacy and aggressive diplomacy are the traditions of the United States' Pacific policy, but it would be impossible to develop this into a military war without overthrowing isolationism in its relations with Europe. From the standpoint of American imperialism, Roosevelt made a huge contribution to the success of this matter. When capital hopes to extend beyond national borders to the world, that is, when it inevitably takes on internationalism economically, it can no longer cling to isolationism politically. Therefore, the collapse of isolationism, although dependent on Roosevelt's efforts, was always the path demanded by American capitalism.</p>
<p>However, it is undeniable that Roosevelt's personality played a major role in relations with Britain and the Soviet Union. For example, with regards to American-Soviet relations, it was Roosevelt who acknowledged the Soviet Union despite the rampant domestic opposition. During last year's presidential election, the Kremlin also openly supported him. Although it is impossible to easily predict what American-Soviet relations will be like after Roosevelt's death, what is particularly subtle is: won't the domestic situation in the United States affect American-Soviet relations?</p>
<h3>The Results of the New Deal</h3>
<p>Roosevelt's domestic policy can truly be regarded as a progressive measure, that is, determining that unemployment is the responsibility of society as a whole. This overturned the Puritan tradition of viewing unemployment as the result of individual laziness, and Roosevelt implemented a series of policies called the "New Deal" based on this new social view. The main reason he was able to break American tradition and be elected four times was not so-called vote-buying or a Jewish conspiracy, but the result of the working masses supporting the new policies. This may have to be frankly admitted. But here, too, there are grounds for opposition from the capitalists.</p>
<p>In last year's election, Vice President Wallace resigned and Truman was selected instead, in an attempt to alleviate the opposition of the financial community to the New Deal. If Roosevelt had foreseen that he would die today, he would have tried his best to keep Wallace, who was brave and loyal to the New Deal. Now, Truman, who has close ties to the financial community, has assumed the presidency in accordance with the constitution. In terms of cabinet members, the New Deal faction is in a lonely and declining state. This is where the biggest problem for the United States in the future lies.</p>
<p>That is, under the New Deal, Roosevelt, in order to check the financial magnates of Wall Street and to facilitate gaining the support of the masses, worked hard to promote liberalism. As a result, labor unions developed rapidly, and they became like enemy countries to the government, parliament, and the financial community. At this point, the problem arises. Under the banner of liberalism fostered by the New Deal, the working masses began to consider what democracy should be like. The world trend of the People's Front, especially the rise of pro-Soviet enthusiasm among the masses after the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, further promoted this trend.</p>
<h3>Where will Truman Go?</h3>
<p>After Roosevelt's death, how will the Truman cabinet, which has a strong financial flavor, lead these masses? Today, the United States is in a state of national frenzy, pursuing the dream of victory and igniting hatred for people of color. Perhaps there will be no difficulties in this wartime excitement. However, when it comes to post-war issues, or with the progress of Soviet work in the United States, how will the two conflicting classes in the United States react? This is a future problem and the most subtle thing. (Kyozo Mori, former New York correspondent for Asahi Shimbun) (Translated from the April 14th Asahi Shimbun)</p>

<h3>Gold Securities Reserve Fund Designated for Special Custody, Banks and Citizens Enthusiastically Purchase Securities</h3>
<p>After the issuance of gold securities on the 7th, banks and the general public went to purchase them with great enthusiasm. It is heard that after issuing the gold securities on the 7th, 8th, and 9th, the Central Reserve Bank will deliver the same amount of gold reserve in full to the Issuance Reserve Fund Management Committee for safekeeping, in accordance with the total amount issued during these three days, for redemption upon maturity. The Management Committee will establish a special vault to store the gold, clarifying management responsibilities. It is also heard that it is planned to designate the treasury of the United Bank Preparatory Committee as the special vault for storing the reserve fund.</p>
<p>Economic Circle's Thoughts</p>
<p>The gold securities issued by the Central Reserve Bank have been listed for sale from the 7th to the 9th, according to the recently published price of 780,000 per tael. Yesterday, a Central News Agency reporter visited a prominent figure in the economic circle and asked about his feelings regarding the Central Reserve Bank's issuance of gold securities. He said that Shanghai has been flooded with floating capital in the past two years, which has failed to find its way into proper investment channels, and has instead been used to purchase and hoard materials. Part of the capital that has flowed into the rural areas of the interior has been unable to flow back to Shanghai because farmers in the interior cannot purchase suitable commodities in Shanghai. Therefore, Shanghai has suffered from the evil trend of hoarding materials, causing prices to continue to rise, the cost of goods to increase, and the turnover of funds to feel increasingly insufficient. Although the Central Reserve Bank has tried its best to adjust funds and increase currency chips, the demand is still difficult to meet, and speculative phenomena have emerged. In addition, the evolution of the situation has affected the entire financial instability. The Central Reserve Bank's issuance of gold securities, with the main purpose of maintaining the value of currency, tightening currency, suppressing prices, and enhancing wartime economic strength, is a timely and good policy. Since the gold securities have full reserves and the public is allowed to freely trade gold securities, it is a new investment avenue for general asset holders, and it should be supported by all sectors of society, finance, and industry. The market situation on the 7th became more stable. Not only did the stock market tend to stabilize, but also the prices of various goods tended to decrease.</p>
<h3>Magazine Federation Re-elects Standing Directors</h3>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Transportation Company</h3>
<p>— Jia Xi</p>
<p>—An Analysis of Shanghai's Public Utilities, Part Two—</p>
<p>Numerous Types of Punishments</p>
<p>The company has many punishment methods, with the main ones being as follows:</p>
<p>Dismissal: Dismissal is considered the most severe punishment in factory administration! However, serving in the tram company carries the risk of dismissal for even the slightest matter. Sometimes, hundreds of people are dismissed at once, mostly for "skimming." After the war, tram routes shortened, and the number of passengers surged. Often, passengers on short trips would get off without paying, or they couldn't buy tickets because it was too crowded. These were considered "missed fares," intentional "skimming," and could result in dismissal. There were also cases of ticket sellers being suspended for "skimming" and, in anger, throwing themselves into the Huangpu River.</p>
<p>Fines: Ticket sellers are fined almost every month, while drivers and workers in other departments are fined less often. To reduce punishment, some secretly pay to avoid consequences.</p>
<p>Demotion: If a worker commits a fault in service, such as skimming, missing fares, issuing wrong tickets, or having conflicts with passengers, the company will demote them for a few days, forbidding them from working. In addition to not receiving wages, they must wait at the company until assigned a shift again. The demotion period ranges from three or four days to ten or more days. Workers at the company call this punishment "office putting down the hat" because they are not allowed to work without a hat.</p>
<p>Rice Deduction: Since the introduction of rationed rice, this punishment has been added. If ticket sellers skim, miss fares, issue wrong tickets, or if inspectors let people on the tram without tickets, their rice ration for the month is suspended. To keep their rice, inspectors and ticket sellers must work diligently.</p>
<p>These four forms of punishment have no regulations or limits. The type of punishment received depends entirely on "luck." In the mechanical department, suspensions and fines are less common, but the workload is heavier.</p>
<p>Working Hours for Internal and External Staff</p>
<p>Previously, workers in the transportation department worked about nine hours a day, divided into morning, afternoon, and night shifts, or sometimes just morning and evening shifts. After trams switched to early morning and late evening services, workers still only worked one shift a day. However, from April 1st of this year, they switched to full-day work. Trams on routes 2 and 5 (trolley) and 21, 16, and 24 (trackless) depart from the Hart Road depot. Routes 7, 8, and 1 depart from the Huishan Wharf. Usually, they depart at 6:00 AM and return to the depot at 11:00 AM, then depart again at 3:00 PM and return around 8:00 PM. On Sundays, they depart at 6:45 AM, stop at 12:00 PM, reopen at 2:00 PM, and stop at 8:00 PM. Recently, routes 2 and 7 have also switched to full-day service. On the surface, it seems that workers in the transportation department work more than ten hours a day, but in reality, it's twelve or even thirteen hours. Because of the preparation for being sent to the work location and the time lost traveling back and forth to change shifts, an average of more than two hours is lost each day. For example, if the early shift starts at 6:00 AM at Hart Road or Jing'an Temple, Huishan Wharf, starting from the company (because they have to go to the company to punch in), it takes almost 30 minutes to get to the destination, so the person taking over the shift has to arrive at the destination before 6:00 AM, meaning they have to prepare to leave around 5:00 AM. They finish at 11:00 AM, then take over again at 3:00 PM until 8:00 PM. By this calculation, the time lost going back and forth each day is more than two and a half hours. On Sundays, the tram stops at 12:00 PM and reopens at 2:00 PM. Because too much time is spent traveling back and forth, there is practically no time to eat. On the other hand, if a driver or ticket seller is a few minutes late, they not only can't get on the tram that day, but they are also fined. Therefore, starting work at 6:00 AM is tantamount to fulfilling their duties at 5:15 AM. Furthermore, after the ticket seller finishes their shift, they must balance the accounts, hand in the money, receive tickets, and match tickets. Drivers must also inspect the vehicles, losing about 45 minutes. External affairs officers, such as ticket inspectors and dispatchers, must also prepare reports, which takes another 30 to 45 minutes. Moreover, if the tram is behind schedule or doesn't arrive at the station on time, they will be heavily fined. Now that the routes are short, there are fewer trams, and passengers are crowded, the tram moves slower, and the ticket seller's job is even more intense, increasing the workload. The mechanical department's work is fixed at nine hours per day, divided into day shifts, which is more regulated than the transportation department. When work is busy, it is temporarily extended by one or two hours to three or four hours, and wages are paid hourly. The same is true for mechanics in the workshop. Accountants in the general accounting office and banknote managers all work nine hours, while senior staff in other departments work about six or seven hours.</p>
<p>General Living Conditions of Employees</p>
<p>The problem of ticket sellers "skimming" is mostly driven by the pressure of life. New ticket sellers often make mistakes due to unfamiliarity, resulting in missed fares and fines. Therefore, ticket sellers often receive less than half their wages at the time of payment. The only way to compensate is through fraud. In recent years, the company has seriously cracked down on the issue of ticket seller fraud and has established ticket booths. Passengers must purchase tickets in advance before lining up to board the tram. At the same time, a lottery is held to reward passengers for keeping their tickets and preventing them from falling into the hands of ticket sellers. Therefore, skimming is now rare.</p>
<p>Dismissal, fines, demotion, and rice deduction are common occurrences. After numerous deductions, they are left in a state of semi-unemployment and semi-starvation, making it difficult to maintain their personal lives. It is even more unimaginable for those with family burdens. A worker has to support several people, and the wife and two or three children are often unable to work. Recently, many employees have sent their families back to their hometowns and are living alone in Shanghai. The company has very few cultural and educational facilities, such as worker's night schools or schools for workers' children. Due to poor nutrition and unsanitary living conditions, disease or infectious diseases are more likely to threaten them.</p>
<p>Workers' marriages are mostly based on arranged marriages and parental decisions. Their spouses are mostly from the same hometown, and there are also quite a few who live together after being introduced by friends. Hobbies: Gambling is the most common. Prostitution has recently become popular again because their families have returned to their hometowns. More than twenty people at the old station smoke opium. The saying that "workers at the new station are hooligans" is actually just a joke; only a very small number of people are like that. Socializing is a legitimate form of entertainment in advanced countries, but here it is used as a means to solve living problems. Their expenses on social obligations are also quite high each month.</p>
<p>The company has more than three thousand workers, but it doesn't have its own hospital, club, library, educational institution, school for workers' children, or sports field. Therefore, visiting the Great World amusement park, going to the company, and watching grand operas or movies with institutional backdrops have become the highlights of their monotonous lives. Some ambitious people also like to box, watch plays, and read books and newspapers. Mechanics have weekly days off, while transportation workers have rotating days off. Most workers like to sleep on their days off or during their spare time, which is the inevitable result of extreme fatigue. (The End)</p>
<h3>Urging Citizens to Cooperate in Completing the Mission of Self-Police and Self-Defense: Director Gu of the Baojia Office's Broadcast Speech Yesterday</h3>
<p>Gu Jiwu, the Director of the Baojia Office of the Shanghai Police Bureau, broadcast to the entire city's public on the evening of the seventh at 9:30 PM via Shanghai Radio Station. He explained a great deal about the Baojia work in the city, and his speech is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>A Miracle in Municipal History</p>
<p>Everyone is a citizen who has lived in Shanghai for many years and is most familiar with the living environment here, which, generally speaking, is complex and deformed. Of course, this situation was not formed overnight, but we want to establish an organized and disciplined Baojia system in such an environment. No one can deny that this is an arduous task.</p>
<p>When the Baojia was first established, some people said that the Shanghai Baojia could not be implemented. However, over the past few years, with the enthusiastic cooperation of citizens and local elders, it has already reached some scale, and the result of fighting with the surrounding environment has achieved some success. This may be said to be a miracle in Shanghai's municipal history.</p>
<p>Emphasizing Practice, Not Empty Talk</p>
<p>I understand that Baojia is a difficult task, but because I was entrusted by the authorities and because of my personal interest, I resolutely undertook this task with many comrades. However, our Baojia Office is only a subordinate department of the Municipal Police Bureau, that is, the liaison and transfer agency between the government and the people, and the leading agency for Baojia affairs. I am like a leading coachman and a border guard. Regardless of how far the Baojia work can be promoted and how much contribution it can make to the country, I will just do it with the purpose of not counting success or failure, and bearing in mind the purpose. I have a concept for serving the Baojia, which is to practice more than empty talk, to value the real training of the people, to cultivate outstanding talents, to serve the local area, to promote a perfect Baojia system, and to dedicate it to the rejuvenation of the country and the nation, and to share the responsibility of defending East Asia. Therefore, one more point of effort we give is one more point of contribution.</p>
<p>Time and Space Are Not Limited</p>
<p>Secondly, I think that Baojia work is not limited by time or space. The hearts of Chinese and foreign people who seek a peaceful and happy life are the same. In the current complex environment, the only way to seek a peaceful and happy life is to start with the Baojia work of self-policing and self-defense. Therefore, we only ask whether it is in line with the principles of people's autonomy and self-defense and whether it should be done. After obtaining real confirmation, we will do it with a spirit of fearlessness, and success, failure, praise, and slander are not considered. At the same time, the Baojia Office is the central agency for promoting the Baojia system in the urban area. I am in charge of the Baojia Office, and in fact, I bear the heavy responsibility of promoting the Baojia. Therefore, I am obliged to plan and promote Baojia work, to cooperate in maintaining neighborhood security, and to relieve the suffering of the people, and I must do my best. However, things in society often lead to bad speculation because they are too responsible and too devoted. However, I only ask that the Baojia work progresses day by day so that the people can get real benefits, and I will never have other thoughts. In other words, I only seek peace of mind.</p>
<p>Striving for Soundness in Expenditure and Income</p>
<p>Regarding the Baojia's funding issue, we have spent a lot of effort to create a sound method. On the income side, we issue corresponding fee-paying stamps to the special households, shop corpses, regular households, and attached households reported by each district. Therefore, there are accurate statistics on how much funding should be received in the entire district, and each district committee affixes the corresponding stamps when collecting fees from each household as proof. On the expenditure side, in addition to allocating 20% to the urban Baojia Committee for overall facilities, all are autonomous by each district. Because each district's committee is composed of local gentry and elders as committee members, and the branch director also participates directly, there is absolutely no corruption. It can be said that it is taken from the people and used for the people, which is very reassuring to us.</p>
<p>Further Cooperating with Municipal Administration</p>
<p>Recently, due to the appointment of Mayor Wu and the appointment of Secretary-General Luo as the chairman of the Urban Baojia Committee, the Baojia work has been epoch-makingly refreshed. In the future, we will further assist in promoting municipal administration, such as in public health. We hope that citizens will, in the spirit of Baojia, automatically cooperate with the health authorities to clean up the city and use the Baojia mechanism to widely prevent epidemics in order to eliminate epidemics that endanger citizens. In the future, the citizen's rationing system will be based on the Baojia district as the rationing district, with precise statistics, so that every citizen can get the due rationing items, and there will be no corruption.</p>
<p>The current situation is urgent, and evacuating the population is the top priority. In addition to actively assisting in the promotion of the Baojia Office, I hope that citizens and women and children who do not need to stay in this city will register with their respective general joint Bao. We will try our best to help with transportation so that they can return home.</p>
<p>Regarding the importance of air defense, I think all citizens have fully understood. The Baojia is standing on the front line of air defense. I hope that citizens will always pay attention to fire control and all air defense measures and not treat life as a child's play.</p>
<p>The promotion of the Baojia system has been in place for several years. To date, we have not been able to reach the ideal state of affairs that you all have. Although due to personnel constraints and restrictions on laws and regulations, we have to unite the people, train the people, achieve the rejuvenation of the country and the nation, and then share the responsibility of defending East Asia, we must continue to work hard and bury ourselves in hard work. We hope that citizens will assist us with enthusiasm and fight together to complete our mission of self-policing and self-defense.</p>
<p>Social Service</p>
<h3>Shanghai You You Nursery's Sixth Recruitment Campaign</h3>
<p>The Shanghai You You Nursery currently houses 150 orphans. Due to the difficulty of food supply in Shanghai, it was moved to Xu Gong Bridge in Anting in mid-March. It has more than 40 acres of farmland and several thatched houses, and it is implementing a farming and reading education to complete a self-sufficient production plan. However, with a large population, it is not easy to maintain. Therefore, the sixth recruitment campaign was launched with a target of 10 million yuan. Yesterday afternoon, Director Lin Kanghou and Chairman Zhang Wenkui invited philanthropists from all walks of life to discuss the recruitment at the YMCA. More than 20 people attended, including Wen Lanting, Lu Zhixue, Tan Tiankai, Xu Zhichao, Dong Hao, and Huang Jingwan. Zhang Jusheng reported on the hospital's affairs, and Zhu Lianxiang reported on the finances. They all agreed that rescuing orphans and giving them appropriate education is a top priority today. They hope that charitable people in society will give sympathy, enthusiastically help, and jointly support this righteous cause so that the goal of 10 million yuan can be achieved as soon as possible. It is what we hope for. On the spot, Mr. Zhang Chunyan generously donated 3 million yuan, and the rest of the people pledged to donate 2 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Mr. Xue Fengyuan Generously Donates Righteous School Funds</h3>
<p>Mr. Xue Fengyuan, the current Deputy Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, is extremely enthusiastic about culture and education. He has assisted greatly in the editing of this newspaper's yearbook. Now, he has donated 15,000 yuan to this newspaper's "Righteous School Funds" to promote it. His enthusiasm is admirable. We would like to thank him on behalf of the poor students.</p>
<h3>Giving Anjian'er Milk Powder: Change to Written Application</h3>
<p>Shanghai Children's Hospital at 51 Xiangshan Road and Shanghai Zhenxin Hospital at 252 Tianjin Road promote children's health by giving away Anjian'er milk powder. Since the start of this month on the 5th, due to overcrowding and waiting for medical time, it is feared that it will affect the health of children. It is specially stipulated that from the 7th of this month, a letter should be sent to the hospital. The letter should state the parent's name, citizen certificate number, occupation, detailed address, family population and their relationship, child's name, actual age in months, whether there are any diseases, etc. Submit it to the Children's Hospital or Zhenxin Hospital for review and then schedule an appointment for an examination.</p>
