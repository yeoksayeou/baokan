<h3>硫磺島附近海面毀敵艦船十八艘　敵四次登陸企圖均被擊退</h3>
<p>東京十八日中央社電　日大本營十八日下午三時三十分發表：（一）日潛艇十七日上午於仁牙因西方海面，攻擊敵機動部隊，擊沉其航空母艦巡洋艦及驅逐艦各一艘。（二）十六日以來對硫磺島週邊之敵艦船，日航空部隊及守備跺所收獲之戰果中，追加轟沉巡洋艦三艘，艦型不詳者三艘，擊沉掃海艇二艘，登陸用運輸船四艘，擊毀巡洋艦一艘，登陸用運輸船五艘。又戰果中擊沉巡洋艦一艘，艦型不詳者三艘予以削除。</p>
<p>東京十八日中央社電　敵軍自十六日晟起，爲念於侵攻硫磺鳥，曾向該島猛烈砲轟，並於是日上午十一時左右藉砲火掩護，分乘運輸船兩艘企圖登陸，該鳥日軍守備部隊當即將其擊退。繼於是日下午五時左右，敵又以十二艘登陸用運輸船，於十七日上午二時及十時前後四次企圖登陸，但均被日軍擊退，給予甚大打擊。同時日軍並於航空部隊協力之下，對該島附近之敵艦船羣加以猛攻，如十八日大本營發表所獲戰果已更加擴大。並於十六日十七日兩日擊落敵艦載機76及SBC型等十三機</p>
<p>東京十八日中央社電　硫磺鳥周邊之敵機動部隊，於十七日上午十時半許，企圖在該烏西南角之二根濱與東南角之「神山海濱」登陸，受日方之猛烈反攻，蒙受重大損害，且被擊退。嗣後更在二根濱方面施放烟幕，使舟艇接近沿岸，但敵方之企圖，顯然不過僅係偽作登地暗施偵察。至十二時許，敵停止該舟艇行動，而仍將其主力配置於該島南方，繼續對日方沿岸陣地實施砲擊，直至十七日下午六時，硫磺島上始終未見敵方一兵一卒。日守備部隊繼續與海上之敵療隊展開猛烈之砲擊戰，而且日方據守完全之防衛陣地，雖受敵軍猛烈之砲擊，但損害則輕至無可再輕。</p>
<h3>科列基多日軍　展開邀擊戰　馬尼剌日軍勇猛殺敵</h3>
<p>呂宋前綫十八日中央社電　日軍對在科列基多島登陸之敵軍，展開激烈異常之邀擊戰，十六日十七日兩日復對該鳥周邊之敵艦船實行猛攻，計轟沉其巡艦一艘，艦型不詳者一艘，及掃海艇一艘。</p>
<p>呂宋前綫十七日中央社電　馬尼刺市街戰，漸次向馬尼刺東北方山地方面擴大。待機中之日軍精銳新隊，自十四日夜漸開始廣範園之反攻，在空軍掩護之下，到處衛殺作戰，美軍傷亡日衆。十四日下午馬尼刺東北郊外之敵軍，已對蒙達班開始砲擊。十四日夜多數之日軍突擊隊，進攻里薩爾州馬里基那方面，出敵之不意，予以極大損害。又是夜分爲二組之其他日軍突擊隊，潛入馬尼刺東郊桑藩，迭爾門第一齊開始攻擊，至十五日拂曉，已將該地敵軍擊退。日軍守備隊，對企圖自布拉干州東進之敵軍，屢次予以大損害。自十一日至十四日止，已查明戰績計殺傷五百以上，起火之汽車貨軍三十五輛，截獲彈藥糧米多數。北部戰綫無重大變化，十二日夜一部敵軍對桑霍塞日軍陣地曾加以攻擊，雙方以白刃交戰後，敵不支潰退，聖哥拉斯方面敵軍，刻正構築陣地，又仁牙因聖法此安·塔克旁之敵軍飛機塲，擁有大小型飛機約三百三十架。在北部戰綫日軍陣地上空，敵軍對克拉克飛機塲，似已開始使用。</p>
<h3>大東亞各地　一週間戰况</h3>
<p>東京十八日中央社電　大東亞各地，一週間戰况如次：</p>
<p>日本本土</p>
<p>及小笠原方面，敵海上部隊之主力，十六日出現於本土東南洋上，擁有戰艦巡艦等之海上艦艇羣，率領登陸舟艇接近硫黃島，用艦砲射擊，目上午直至下午，同時米茲卡所指揮之第五十八機動部隊，復以共計千架之艦載機來襲關東各地區之飛機塲。十七日亦連續來襲，十六日傍晚當敵登陸舟艇羣接近硫黃島之南方，企圖攻陷該島之野心，益見顯著。敵軍此次來襲之目的，在除去威脅馬利亞納基地之日軍前衛線，同時企圖獲得攻擊日本本土之小型基地。敵機動部隊之背後，想必有相當之兵力待機，故下週內該方面戰局之推移，頗具重大意義。</p>
<p>馬尼剌方面</p>
<p>尼米資司令部稱，侵入大宮島方面之B29型逐次增强航空兵力，海上部隊亦漸次增張中。</p>
<p>摩羅泰島</p>
<p>方面，摩羅泰烏之日軍部隊，仍於叢林中保有持久出血戰之堅固陣地，邇來屢行肉搏衝鋒，使敵流血甚多。自敵登陸以來，業經查明之戰果，共殺傷敵兵達四千六百十六名，此外破毀燃燒敵砲十門，幕舍物資貯藏所百十三處，其他武器子彈燃料甚夥。</p>
<p>中國方面</p>
<p>本月七日攻陷新域，八日於該地取得連繫，刻下覆滅遂贛基地羣之日軍精銳，正擴大戰果中。</p>
<p>緬甸方面</p>
<p>進犯北緬畹町附近之渝方雲南遠征軍主力，於二月初旬以來，沿史蒂威爾公路進向北緬，藉期防衛昆明南巴塔左近之日軍部隊。七日以來從事戰綫之整理，自南卡橋南部現身擊敵新編第一軍之二三師團中。自去年二月二十日至本月五日，該方面之綜合戰果，計殺傷敵兵三萬，擊落飛機二十九架，鹵獲並破坡大砲五門，戰車一輛，載重貨車五輛，重輕機槍三百零七十七挺。孟德蘭地區敵軍，對孟德蘭之攻勢逐次熾烈，近一週來該地周邊之戰鬥頗爲激烈。</p>
<p>阿拉坎方面</p>
<p>康哥正面之敵軍行動，頗見積極，現以至近之距離與日軍對時中，蘭里鳥之日軍部隊刻與優勞敵軍激鬥，籍連日作突擊，收得甚大戰果。又日軍機隊本月十一日曾攻繫遊弋於蘭里島東北水道之敵方艦船，而擊沉其驅逐艦一艘，擊毀其巡洋艦一艘。十二日復攻擊集合於伊洛瓦底河附近之敵方部隊，十三日又進攻盤谷西方五十公里叢林中之敵軍新飛行塲，而擊燬停於地上之敵機五架。</p>

<h3>上海特別市第一區行政督察專員公署訪問記</h3>
<p>— 逸飛</p>
<p>一月二十六日下午，天氣晴朗，僅有幾朶彩雲點綴在空際，記者經鄕人的指示，找到了「上海特別市第一區行政督察專員公署」，旋被導入樓上之會客室，室內陳設頗爲簡單，一切皆甚整潔，最觸目者，爲周專員親筆所書之「廉潔愛民」之橫聯，高懸壁際。旋專員局化人氏出見。記者與周氏曾同窗於英國倫敦大學政經學院，十二年後彼此又重晤於周浦鎭，頗感快慰。寒暄旣畢，即請周氏對專員公署之工作及現况，略作說明。</p>
<p>公署組織及動機</p>
<p>記者首問該署設立之動機，及其內部組織情形。據答：「遠在客歲七月間，當時陳代主席兼市長時期，爲推行國策，强化縣政起見，首先擬由市屬七縣做起。乃以七縣旣屬滬市之外圍，其行政優劣，與治安之能否確立，影響上海市頗鉅，故該時將七縣分作兩行政區：南匯，奉腎，川沙，申江歸第一區，祟明，寳山，嘉定三縣則列入於第二行政區。每區各設立行政督察專員公署，司行政，督察之責」。談至此，記者詢此種制度在我國行政史上有前例否？據答：「按諸有淸一代，曾有按察署及道尹制度，而民國念一年七省勦匪時期，亦曾一度設有行政督察專員公署，但皆與目前之「專員公署」性質不同。蓋現今之組織「專員」爲中央官，其職務在監督各縣政府行政。故其本身不兼任當地之縣長「按最近內政部發表，行政督察專員得兼任縣長）。祇秉承中央之意旨，督察區內縣府行政。旋言及該署內部組織，周氏謂：「堪以自慰者，即就任前曾具有决心，一洗過去官塲之積習，决不引用一私人。且皆就地取村。如目前供職該署之視察王靜齋。爲前申江縣政府科長，秘書方謙氏，係南匯縣人，皆對常地情形至熟，對行政推進，易收功效，餘皆學有專長，非服務敎育界有年，具有經騐，即軍官學校畢業生。對於訓練民衆，確立治安，皆具卓見。至內部之組織，分爲數組，每組組長由　任署員兼任。現有署員十人，委任六人，　任四人，秘書二人，視察四人。</p>
<p>恢復縣治之原因</p>
<p>記者問：「數月前來南匯一帶考察時，發現特別區公署時代之流弊甚多，目下已復縣治，行政雖有改進之處，然尙未臻於理想之境，其　結仍在，希吿知一二。」據答：「過去特別區公署之組織，在行政上其地位不啻市政府之各地分辦事處，毫無實權。例如財政方面，田賦之收入，全數由市府派人提去，該署本身之經費，則由市府另行撥發，致常有拖欠之事。行政方面，警察係受市府警察局直接指揮，該署不能過問。敎育行政則又受市敎育局之支配，署長亦無法問津。故往往一椿公事，往返耗時，兼以下情不能上達，百政廢止。當局有鑒於此，爲强化縣府之權力，並使其也位增高，成爲自治單位，負地方與中央溝通之重任，故毅然恢復縣治，以期對於行政上，有所改進。然半年來縣政之未能達於理想，其原因至爲複雜，總之不外縣府財政困難，輿夫治安之不能確立。關於此兩點，容當爲君另行述告。」談至此略進茶點，旋又繼續談話。</p>
<p>縣政推行之障礙</p>
<p>「按本公署成立之初，曾召開區行政會議，經本人提議，確立各縣政府之地方預算，如是百政始能着手進行。又因目前田賦統歸縣收，故對其款項支用之分配，亦有下列之建議，即按百分比率，田賦收入除百分之卅呈解市府外，其餘數應分四部門，比重如次：（一）治安經費應佔經費收人全數百分之四十，（二）敎育經費應佔百分之廿，（三）建設經費應佔百分之廿，（四）行政經費應佔百分之廿。此理想支出計劃，雖事後呈市府備案，奈以環境關係，未能付諸實施，殊屬遺憾。致目前百政停頓，蓋以財政不求解決，一切無從談起。」</p>
<p>確保治安之對策</p>
<p>「查遠如淸代李鴻章敉平中原捻匪，及近若江西勦共時期，歷史與經騐啓示吾人，對付遊匪之良策，莫若採取逐漸緊縮包圍政策。而此政策之長有効之辦法，又莫如發展後方之交通線，再於沿線建立據點，配置重兵，與當地民衆協力據守。每一據點，依地位之重要，興築大小碉堡，一旦有警，進可以攻，退可以守而待援。此政策本可付諸實現，亦以經費關係，無法澈底推行。公路除一部已行完成外，餘者仍須俟的款有着，始克全功盡成；而碉堡政策，亦祗周浦鎭建成兩座耳。</p>
<p>記者問：「欲求地方治安之確保，除軍隊外，民衆之協力實屬重要，未卜貴署對訓練民衆之工作，有否舉辦？」周氏答稱：「關於此點，公署方面曾於去年十二月間創設區鄉組長訓練所，四縣應受訓練人員，總計二百四十九名，第一期受訓者計六十五名，受訓期爲兩星期，完全施以軍事訓練。主要學科，有國父遺敎，主席遣訓，行政計劃，保甲法規，公文程式，合作運動，農業增產，自警團組織與訓練。至術科方面，則有步兵操練，防空，防諜，情報，交通，軍隊內幕等科。除學科外尙有小組討論，如敎育，增產等項，並請名人來所講演。灌輸彼等一切智識。事後舉行考試，及格渚計四十二人。第二期以鄕人素重視廢曆新年，故暫時停頓，俟二月下旬，當再進行」。</p>
<p>敎育經費將獨立</p>
<p>最後記者又問：「按　實際，目前政府，雖勵精圖治，奈種種計劃，實行時往往因民衆智識程度太差，不能領會與接受，致碍進行實大。是則民衆敎育，實屬首要，未卜貴署對此亦有計劃否？」周氏稱「關於此點，前此本人曾屢倡各縣之敎育經費應予以獨立，至經費之保管，亦不宜假手縣政府，應組織「敎育經費保管委員會」，採半官性質，即由縣府之敎育科長，及縣敎育會之理事長與學　委員會管理處長等爲當然委員外，再加當地紳商名流與熱心敎育者，共同組織之，其人數約五人至七人，負全縣敎育之籌劃及保管敎育經費之責。此辦法亦曾通過區行政會護，呈經市府備案，由公署通令各縣執行，袛以時間關係，與夫過去之潛勢力，根深底固，一時不易剷除，致實行者仍未一見」。繼又謂：「敎育經費問題解決後，自可逐步推進義務學校，民衆敎育館，舉辦巡迴書庫，勵行成人及婦女補習敎育，及識字運動，庶幾文盲減少，民衆智識亦自能由是提高，俾益國家行政之推行，實屬重要。」</p>
<p>代論</p>
<h3>期待於警察當局者　二月十八日在贈金典禮會中演辭</h3>
<p>— 陳彬龢</p>
<p>上海的警察，創始於遜淸咸豐四年，至今有九十一年的悠久歷史了。在這九十一年間，上海不知經歷了多少次滄桑變亂，然而每一次變亂都能平穩渡過，其最大的原因，還應該歸功於警察維持治安的努力。上海的警察，在過去有着光榮的歷史。</p>
<p>警察與人民有着最密切的關係，適才羅秘書長已經說得很透澈。羅秘書長在主政安徽時，曾勉勵公務員說，在目前艱難的時期，公務員對待人民僅僅以「服務」兩字還嫌不够，公務員必須以子女老順父母的精神，爲人民服務。我現在反過來說，警察是人民的父母官，父母無有不愛子女，因此爲子女者亦無有不爲父母着想。所以去年蘇前副局長倡議設立警察消費合作社時，市民福利協會曾代爲籌墊資金三千數百萬元。最近以農曆年底，由於警員平時薪俸的微簿，責任的重大，工作之艱苦，所以再有此次贈金之舉。雖然兩次的數目並不多，而動機却非常眞誠，這正是市民感謝最親密的父母官的一種赤誠表示。無論羅秘書長說的警察以孝子的精神來爲市民服務也好，無論如我說的警察以父母官的能度爲市民謀福利也好，總之警察與人民是一家人，換言之即軍警民應當打成一片。果如此，則上海今後的治安，可以毋庸顧慮；過去九十一年來上海警察的光榮歷史，因此更發揚光大。</p>
<p>今日我們站在市民的立塲，對上海警察有兩點期待：</p>
<p>第一，我們期待於本國籍警察者。在各先進國家中，警察還負有敎導人民的責任，亦即是說，有好的警察，才有好的人民，警察個個能奉公守法，人民才能奉公守法。因此我們希望警察能作我們市民的模範，站在每一個崗位上，發揮其最大的力量。</p>
<p>第二，我們期望於日籍警務人員者。無論在訓練方面，在職守方面，盟邦日本的警察向來馳名於世界，近年來上海警察局能得到盟邦警務專門人員的參加，實在是値得慶幸的事。去年有一位服務於市政府的日籍高級人員問我，中國人對於在中國機關中服務的日本人士，有何期待？我的答覆是：希望能在中國公務員中發生模範作用。所以，我們不但希望本國籍警察做市民的模範，同時還希望日籍警務人員，能做中國警務人員的模範。</p>
<p>最後還有一點要請求的，在大東亞戰爭以前，英國統治租界的時期中，巡捕房一切章則及對待人民的態度，都採取帝國主義對待殖民地的手段；因爲時間悠久，不無積重難返，尙有極少數中日警員，現在依舊採用舊方法。例如對待盜賊，對待工商界，對待智識分子，不論案情輕重，無甚區別，因之使人民不敢接近警察，不敢踏入警察局，像過去同樣不敢接近巡捕，同樣不敢踏人巡捕房。現在時代巳經改變，租界也已收回，中日是同盟國家，警察是人民最親密的父母官，過去那種舊思想舊方法，不再適用；希望我警察當局及盟邦高級警員，迅速糾正。使警察人民打成一片，和家人一般，共同負起保衛大上海的責任。</p>
<h3>凌海長發表　對戰局觀感</h3>
<p>（續昨）記者問：請問目下我國新海軍之躍進實况如何？（部長答）國府還都後，盟邦基於道義立塲，將沿海基地及海軍艦艇先後交還我國，並協力培養新海軍。數年以來，我海軍己由萌芽而至新生階段，本部於此數年間，積極訓練海軍員兵。目前力量雖尙不足以出征擊敵，但有盟邦海軍當局協力之下，全國海防任務已由我新海軍擔負，今後更將加緊訓練海軍基本幹部，俾鞏固沿海防務，使敵軍無隙可乘。總之，吾國新海軍之建設工作，業已奠定其新生基礎。最近本人曾赴上海視察中央海軍學校，中央水兵訓練所，永路測量局等各機關，所有官佐士兵學生等，精神飽滿，情緒振奮，並經分訪盟邦海軍當局，咸對我新海軍之建設，深寄期待，而更願赤誠協助，故吾新海軍前途實頗明朗，此可告慰國人者也。（完）</p>

<h3>蘇軍整理部隊　準備新攻勢　上西里西亞德軍反攻</h3>
<p>柏林十八日中央社電　海通社訊：東線中路目前之局勢，最重要者爲蘇軍司令部現正部署其軍隊，此不但包圍布萊斯勞之部數爲然，即在沃時河戰線之蘇柯夫上將之部下，亦從事相當之部署。一週以來蘇軍作戰之目的，爲爭奪沃特河之渡口，有此然後可以大舉進攻柏林，但蘇軍在此時期竟停止進攻，並撤退大量之軍隊，其故安在，僅有一答，即被牽掣於波森區之蘇軍因交通困難，實難抽調足够之生力軍。蘇軍司令部更目沃特河抽調生力軍，開赴波默拉尼亞戰線，此項特殊之行動，必有其緊急之原因在焉。富斯頓堡。庫斯特林之進攻陣線甚爲狹小，長約五十公里，若苏柯夫上將繼續向柏林推進，則其兩翼再事增長五十公里，如是則蘇軍有腹背受敵之危，故蘇柯夫上將於目前尙不敢貿然向沃特河進攻。渠之基本思想，在準備與增强其進攻戰綫，以爲大規模進攻拍林之先聲。蘇軍目前自史泰諾向波柏河與奎期河方面之威脅攻勢，以及在格羅高與格倫堡間向西之壓力均爲此故。强有力之總軍在各處邀擊蘇軍之攻勢，迫其停進，蘇軍在比里資—安斯華爾特附近之進攻，亦被德軍反攻所阻</p>

<p>「諸位先生：今天上海市民福利協會舉行軍警贈金典禮，同時歡送警察局蘇副局長，蘇副局長自從前年八月接收租界時，來滬任職，討於合併警局，統一警政，貢獻殊多，表示深切感謝。現在調任清鄕事務局長，名義上雖變更職務，但實際上仍然担負上海一部份治安責任，所以就離去警察局言是歡送，就上海的整個治安言，還是說歡迎。過去一般人的印象中對於清鄕一事，具有不良的觀念，現在希望蘇局長接事以後，積極的從工作成績拐角回這些不良印象，克盡一部分治安的責任，這是上海市所最盼望的，敬祝蘇局長努力與健康」。</p>
<p>林康侯氏報吿</p>
<p>「在這嚴重進期中，去年冬防時期，於新市和長督飭指揮下，安全渡過農曆年關可見事在人爲。整飭風紀，須在上級做起，上級纔得迫隨。當前軍警風紀，已嚴加整飭，日趨改善，此次本市工商各界人氏，爲向幸勞之軍警人員，表示謝意，舉行贈金，是項贈金，已於農曆大除夕，由聞蘭亭，陳彬龢二先生偕同本人至市府，面陳羅秘書長。今天補行典禮，是工商各界向軍警官佐表示親誠，而賢明長官，能愛護市民，軍警民打成一片，上海治安定能安定，人民寄以期待，本人代表工商各界，以萬分誠意，向賢明官佐表示謝忱」。</p>
<p>羅秘書長答詞</p>
<p>「今天奉市長之命，代表市長並代表市保安隊，市警察局全體同人來講幾句話。上海市民福利協會在很短促的時期中，籌得很大的款項，贈送保安隊及警察局全體軍警人員，吾人當於精神上及內心，萬分感謝。本來國家設保安隊及警察是爲保護地方治安，軍警的天職，就是保護地方，維持治安，上海市民這樣熱忱，給予吾人以很大的鼓勵，軍警人員當更形努力，維護治安，保護人民，纔能答謝市民愛戴之至意。上海是我國的大都市，東市的大都市，也可以說是世界大都會之一，所以在上海作惡爲歹，非但爲國家及東方人所鄙棄，並且爲全世界人所鄙棄，我們要做東方人的表率，才不致爲世界所鄙棄。吾軍警人員，更當本其責職良心，努力安定上海治安的任務。在此嚴重的時期中，上海軍警保護地方，愛護人民，得有小小成績，而上海市民給予如此鼓勵，衷心感謝。兄弟在安徽省政府時，曾對部屬告誡，今天的軍警人員，僅爲民衆服務，是不够的，須以「兒子孝順父母」的精神，爲國家社會服務。蓋父母雖在病危時，爲子女者，仍須竭力延醫挽救，現在民衆在水深火熱之中，民衆就是軍警人員的父母，而吾人當以子女孝順父母的精神，負其責職，爲民衆解除困苦，務使地方安定，人民安居樂業。我代表保安隊及警察局全體同人，向市民福利協會及上海市民道市謝，吾人不間今後如何演變，我軍警同人，必更爲努力，成敗不計，我們有確定的方向，堅定的決心，對上海的治安，不異用我們的血汗與全部精神，來保護大上海，盡最後一分的力量，麗最後的一滴血，必須完成保衛大上海的任務」。</p>
<p>蘇副局長答辭</p>
<p>「今天承熱烈招待歡送，感激之餘，愧不敢當。成德承乏警副局長，兩年之中，愧無建樹，今雖調長清鄕，仍負確保上海地方漢安責任，名義雖不同，目標責職還是一樣。今後一切措施，當本諸周市長所昭示我們的「公益於私利，社會先於個人」的訓詞，作爲服務施政之信條。再於今天軍警贈金典禮中，想到去年計劃改善警察生活時，警局設立消費合作社，深賴海上各界市民，尤其聞·袁·林·李諸老先生，鼎力贊助，在短短時期中，得順成功，全體員警，受惠非淺，乘此機會，代申謝忱。敝人雖離開警局，仿後仍爲上海治安努力工作，希望時時不吝指敎。」</p>

<h3>古今書畫展覧會記</h3>
<p>— 梅雯</p>
<p>申報主辦的古今書畫展覧會，已於十六日起，假成都路中國畫苑開幕。因爲所陳列的書畫約有三百餘件，筆者不願錯過眼福，便去參觀。我雖然是一個外行，但　介了這麼許多書畫，似乎是有所得，並且認爲値得也紹一下。</p>
<p>這次展覽的作品很多，掛滿了中國畫苑的塲子。作者包括古今南北，有石濤，劉石痷，王文治，曾國藩，吳大徵，康有爲，章太炎，鄭孝胥，徐世昌，近人有葉恭綽，吳湖帆，張大千，溥心畬等。參觀的士女相當多，害得一位招待簽名的小姐忙得手忙脚亂。但是會塲中的空氣却非常靜穆，因爲每一個來賓都在靜心注目地覽賞着每一幅藝術精品。</p>
<p>在第一室當門陳列着天津陳少梅和蘇州貝照聿女士的山水，陳氏的造就是非常高深。「仿仇十洲靑山緣水」「寒林圖」諸幅，皆穏健。「方西老人小幅」佈局疏鬆可喜，有宋人遺氣，實在是一幅難得的作品。在劉石庵草書傍邊，發現詞人朱彝尊所寫的行稽，朱氏的作品是頹有見到的，早已被一位先生了去，識貨的人到底是有的。</p>
<p>在第二座橫列裏掛着葉恭綽，張大千，吳湖帆諸氏的作品。葉工的一幅單色的竹軸，筆致飄逸，得瀟灑之趨。至於他巨幅的行書，氣勢雄奇，結構謹嚴，在當代藝術界中早有定評的了。吳湖帆的「嚴灘春日曉」手卷，陳列在玻璃櫃內，泉石美秀，峯繕銷拔，彌見功力，的確可以稱一聲逸品了。</p>
<p>這次展　會定價低廉，也可認爲是物色之一。尤其是在書的一方面，鄭孝胥，劉石庵，章太炎，王文治，兪曲園，梁啓超諸氏的作品，一向被人所珍貴的，差不多都只有買四五千元一幅，散原老人的一付對聯只有買二千元，難怪大部份都被人購定了。在最後一室角落裏掛着一付袁世凱的七字對：「自願勤勞甘戰，莫將成敗論三分」。標價一萬元，字却看不出甚麼功夫，這是他自道甘苦，也許收藏這付對聯，在藝術意養外，還有歷史上的價値吧。</p>
<p>是後筆者要特別提出的，是溥心畬的人物小軸，錢瘦鐵的設色山水，王一亭的佛像，趙叔僞的花卉，的確各俱風格，不同凡谷。</p>

<h3>Eighteen Enemy Ships Destroyed Near Iwo Jima; Four Enemy Landing Attempts Repelled</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on the 18th: (1) On the morning of the 17th, a Japanese submarine attacked an enemy task force in the sea west of Lingayen, sinking one aircraft carrier, one cruiser, and one destroyer. (2) Regarding the results achieved by Japanese air units and defense forces against enemy ships around Iwo Jima since the 16th, the following are added: three cruisers sunk, three ships of unknown type sunk, two minesweepers sunk, four landing transport ships sunk, one cruiser damaged, and five landing transport ships damaged. Furthermore, the results of one cruiser sunk and three ships of unknown type sunk have been removed.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) – Since the morning of the 16th, enemy forces have been intensely bombarding Iwo Jima in an attempt to invade it. Around 11:00 AM, under the cover of artillery fire, they attempted to land using two transport ships, but were immediately repelled by the Japanese defense forces on the island. Subsequently, around 5:00 PM that afternoon, the enemy attempted to land four times, using twelve landing transport ships, around 2:00 AM and 10:00 AM on the 17th, but were all repelled by the Japanese forces, inflicting significant damage. Simultaneously, with the cooperation of Japanese air units, a fierce attack was launched against the enemy fleet near the island. As announced by the Imperial Headquarters on the 18th, the achieved results have been further expanded. On the 16th and 17th, 76 enemy carrier-based aircraft and 13 SBC-type aircraft were shot down.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) – The enemy task force around Iwo Jima attempted to land at Nigenhama on the southwest corner and "Mt. Kami Beach" on the southeast corner of the island around 10:30 AM on the 17th. They suffered significant damage and were repelled by the fierce Japanese counterattack. Afterwards, they released smoke screens in the Nigenhama area to allow boats to approach the coast, but the enemy's attempt was clearly just a feint for reconnaissance. Around 12:00 PM, the enemy ceased the boat activity and continued to position their main force south of the island, continuing to shell the Japanese coastal positions until 6:00 PM on the 17th. Not a single enemy soldier was seen on Iwo Jima. The Japanese defense forces continued a fierce artillery battle with the enemy fleet at sea, and the Japanese, holding a complete defensive position, suffered minimal damage despite the intense enemy shelling.</p>
<h3>Japanese Forces on Corregidor Launch Counterattacks; Japanese Forces in Manila Bravely Fight the Enemy</h3>
<p>Luzon Front, 18th (Central News Agency) – Japanese forces are launching fierce counterattacks against enemy forces landing on Corregidor Island. On the 16th and 17th, they launched fierce attacks against enemy ships around the island, sinking one cruiser, one ship of unknown type, and one minesweeper.</p>
<p>Luzon Front, 17th (Central News Agency) – The street fighting in Manila is gradually expanding towards the mountainous areas northeast of Manila. Elite new units of the Japanese army, waiting for an opportunity, began a widespread counterattack from the night of the 14th, fighting everywhere under the cover of air support, causing increasing casualties to the American forces. In the afternoon of the 14th, enemy forces in the northeastern outskirts of Manila began shelling Montalban. On the night of the 14th, numerous Japanese commando units attacked Marikina in Rizal Province, taking the enemy by surprise and inflicting great damage. That same night, other Japanese commando units divided into two groups, infiltrated the eastern suburbs of Manila, Sampaloc, and launched attacks simultaneously from the first district of Diliman. By dawn on the 15th, they had driven out the enemy forces from the area. The Japanese defense forces have repeatedly inflicted heavy damage on enemy forces attempting to advance eastward from Bulacan Province. From the 11th to the 14th, the confirmed results of the battles include over 500 enemy soldiers killed or wounded, 35 trucks and military vehicles set ablaze, and a large amount of ammunition and food captured. There have been no major changes on the northern front. On the night of the 12th, a unit of enemy forces attacked the Japanese positions in San Jose, resulting in a bayonet fight, after which the enemy retreated in defeat. Enemy forces in the Santo Tomas area are currently constructing fortifications. Furthermore, the enemy airfield in Lingayen, San Fabian, and Dagupan has approximately 330 aircraft of various sizes. On the northern front, the enemy has apparently begun using the Clark Airfield in the skies above the Japanese positions.</p>
<h3>War Situation in Various Parts of Greater East Asia in One Week</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) – The war situation in various parts of Greater East Asia in one week is as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Mainland</p>
<p>In the Ogasawara area, the main force of the enemy naval force appeared on the southeastern sea off the mainland on the 16th, with a naval fleet including battleships and cruisers, leading landing boats approaching Iwo Jima, using naval gun fire. From morning to afternoon, the 58th Task Force commanded by Mitscher also launched attacks with a total of 1,000 carrier-based aircraft on airfields in various areas of Kanto. The attacks continued on the 17th. As the enemy landing boats approached the south of Iwo Jima on the evening of the 16th, their ambition to capture the island became even more evident. The purpose of the enemy's attack is to remove the Japanese forward line that threatens the Mariana base and attempt to obtain a small base to attack the Japanese mainland. There must be a considerable force waiting behind the enemy task force, so the development of the war situation in that area next week is of great significance.</p>
<p>Manila Area</p>
<p>Nimitz Headquarters stated that the B-29s invading the Omiya Island area are gradually increasing their air power, and the naval forces are also gradually increasing.</p>
<p>Morotai Island</p>
<p>Regarding the Morotai Island area, the Japanese forces in Morotai still maintain a strong defensive position in the jungle for prolonged bloody battles. Recently, they have repeatedly carried out bayonet charges, causing the enemy to suffer many casualties. Since the enemy landed, the confirmed results of the battles include 4,616 enemy soldiers killed or wounded, 10 enemy cannons destroyed or burned, 113 enemy shelters and material storage sites destroyed, and a large amount of other weapons, ammunition, and fuel destroyed.</p>
<p>China Area</p>
<p>Xinyu was captured on the 7th of this month, and contact was established in the area on the 8th. The elite Japanese forces that annihilated the Suiqian base group are currently expanding their war results.</p>
<p>Burma Area</p>
<p>The main force of the Chinese Yunnan Expeditionary Army invading the area near Wanting in northern Burma has been advancing along the Stilwell Road towards northern Burma since early February, with the aim of defending the Japanese troops near Kunming and Nanpata. Since the 7th, they have been reorganizing their battle lines, and the 23rd Division of the newly formed First Army has appeared in the south of Nanka Bridge to attack the enemy. From February 20th of last year to February 5th of this month, the comprehensive war results in that area include 30,000 enemy soldiers killed or wounded, 29 enemy aircraft shot down, 5 large guns and 1 tank captured or destroyed, 5 heavy trucks captured, and 377 heavy and light machine guns captured. The enemy forces in the Mandalay area have been intensifying their offensive against Mandalay. The fighting around the area has been quite fierce in the past week.</p>
<p>Arakan Area</p>
<p>The enemy's actions on the Kangaw front are quite active, and they are currently facing off against the Japanese forces at close range. The Japanese forces on Ramree Island are engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy forces in Yeu, achieving great results through repeated raids. Furthermore, on the 11th of this month, Japanese air units attacked enemy ships cruising in the northeast channel of Ramree Island, sinking one destroyer and damaging one cruiser. On the 12th, they attacked enemy forces gathered near the Irrawaddy River. On the 13th, they attacked a new enemy airfield in the jungle 50 kilometers west of Pegu, destroying five enemy aircraft on the ground.</p>
<p>Zhoupu Communication</p>
<h3>A Visit to the First District Administrative Inspector's Office of Shanghai Special Municipality</h3>
<p>— Yifei</p>
<p>On the afternoon of January 26th, the weather was sunny, with only a few colorful clouds adorning the sky. Following the directions of a local, the reporter found the "First District Administrative Inspector's Office of Shanghai Special Municipality" and was soon led to the reception room upstairs. The room's furnishings were quite simple, and everything was very tidy. The most striking thing was the horizontal scroll written in Commissioner Zhou's own hand, "Integrity and Love for the People," which hung high on the wall. Soon, Commissioner Zhou's secretary, Mr. Ju, came out to meet me. The reporter and Mr. Zhou had been classmates at the London School of Economics and Political Science in England, and after twelve years, we met again in Zhoupu Town, which was quite gratifying. After exchanging pleasantries, I asked Mr. Zhou to briefly explain the work and current situation of the Commissioner's Office.</p>
<p>Organization and Motivation of the Commissioner's Office</p>
<p>The reporter first asked about the motivation for establishing the office and the internal organization. He replied, "As early as last July, during the tenure of Acting Chairman and Mayor Chen, in order to promote national policies and strengthen county administration, we first planned to start with the seven counties under the city. Since the seven counties are on the periphery of Shanghai, their administrative quality and the establishment of public security have a significant impact on Shanghai, so at that time, the seven counties were divided into two administrative districts: Nanhui, Fengxian, Chuansha, and Shenjiang were assigned to the First District, while Chongming, Baoshan, and Jiading were included in the Second Administrative District. Each district established an Administrative Inspector's Office to be responsible for administration and supervision." At this point, the reporter asked if there was any precedent for this system in China's administrative history. He replied, "According to the Qing Dynasty, there were offices for provincial investigating commissioners and circuit intendants, and during the suppression of bandits in the seven provinces in the 21st year of the Republic of China, Administrative Inspector's Offices were also temporarily established, but they were all different in nature from the current 'Commissioner's Office.' The current organization of 'Commissioner' is a central government official, and his duty is to supervise the administration of the county governments. Therefore, he does not concurrently serve as the local county magistrate (according to the latest announcement from the Ministry of Interior, Administrative Inspectors can concurrently serve as county magistrates). He only carries out the intentions of the central government to supervise the administration of the county governments in the district." Then, speaking of the internal organization of the office, Mr. Zhou said, "What I can be pleased with is that before taking office, I had the determination to wash away the accumulated bad habits of the past officialdom and never employ a private individual. Moreover, all are hired locally. For example, the current inspector of the office, Wang Jingzhai, was the section chief of the former Shenjiang County Government; Secretary Fang Qian is from Nanhui County, and they are both very familiar with the local situation, which makes it easier to promote administration. The others all have specialized knowledge and years of experience in the education sector, or are graduates of military academies. They all have excellent views on training the people and establishing public security. As for the internal organization, it is divided into several groups, and each group leader is concurrently appointed by the office staff. Currently, there are ten office staff, six appointed and four concurrently appointed, two secretaries, and four inspectors.</p>
<p>Reasons for Restoring County Governance</p>
<p>The reporter asked, "When I came to inspect the Nanhui area a few months ago, I found many malpractices during the Special District Office era. Although there have been improvements in administration since the restoration of county governance, it has not yet reached the ideal state, and the problems still exist. I hope you can tell me a thing or two." He replied, "In the past, the organization of the Special District Office was nothing more than local branches of the Municipal Government in terms of administration, with no real power. For example, in terms of finance, all of the land tax revenue was taken away by the Municipal Government, and the office's own expenses were allocated separately by the Municipal Government, which often resulted in arrears. In terms of administration, the police were directly commanded by the Municipal Police Bureau, and the office could not interfere. Education administration was also controlled by the Municipal Education Bureau, and the head of the office could not intervene. Therefore, it often took a long time to handle a public affair, and the lower-level situation could not be reported to the higher-ups, so hundreds of policies were abandoned. The authorities, in view of this, in order to strengthen the power of the county government and increase its status, making it an autonomous unit responsible for communicating between the local and central governments, resolutely restored county governance in order to improve administration. However, the reason why county administration has not reached the ideal in the past six months is very complicated. In general, it is nothing more than the county government's financial difficulties and the inability to establish public security. I will tell you about these two points separately." At this point, tea and refreshments were served, and then the conversation continued.</p>
<p>Obstacles to the Implementation of County Administration</p>
<p>"At the beginning of the establishment of this office, we convened a district administrative meeting. At my suggestion, we established local budgets for the county governments so that hundreds of policies could be implemented. Furthermore, since the land tax is now collected by the counties, I also made the following recommendations on the distribution of its funds, that is, according to the percentage ratio, after 30% of the land tax revenue is submitted to the municipal government, the remaining amount should be divided into four departments, with the following proportions: (1) Public security expenses should account for 40% of the total revenue, (2) Education expenses should account for 20%, (3) Construction expenses should account for 20%, (4) Administrative expenses should account for 20%. This ideal expenditure plan was submitted to the municipal government for record, but unfortunately, it could not be implemented due to environmental factors. This is very regrettable. The reason why hundreds of policies have stalled is that everything is impossible to talk about unless the financial problems are solved."</p>
<p>Countermeasures to Ensure Public Security</p>
<p>"Looking back to the Qing Dynasty, when Li Hongzhang pacified the Nian Rebellion in the Central Plains, and more recently, during the suppression of the Communists in Jiangxi, history and experience tell us that the best way to deal with roving bandits is to adopt a policy of gradual tightening of the encirclement. And the most effective way to implement this policy is to develop transportation lines in the rear and then establish strongholds along the lines, deploying heavy troops and cooperating with the local people to defend them. Each stronghold, depending on the importance of its position, should build large and small bunkers, so that in case of an alarm, it can advance to attack, retreat to defend, and wait for reinforcements. This policy could have been implemented, but it could not be thoroughly implemented due to financial constraints. With the exception of a portion of the highway that has been completed, the rest must wait for funds to be available before the project can be fully completed; and as for the bunker policy, only two bunkers have been built in Zhoupu Town."</p>
<p>The reporter asked, "In order to ensure local public security, in addition to the military, the cooperation of the people is very important. Has your office organized any work to train the people?" Mr. Zhou replied, "On this point, the office established a district and township leaders training center in December of last year. The total number of personnel to be trained from the four counties is 249. The first group consisted of 65 trainees, and the training period was two weeks, with purely military training. The main subjects included Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, Chairman's instructions, administrative plans, Baojia laws and regulations, official document formats, cooperative movements, agricultural production increase, self-defense group organization and training. As for practical subjects, there were infantry drills, air defense, counter-espionage, intelligence, transportation, and the inside story of the military. In addition to academic subjects, there were also group discussions on topics such as education and production increase, and celebrities were invited to give lectures at the center, instilling all kinds of knowledge in them. Afterwards, an examination was held, and 42 candidates passed the examination. The second group was temporarily suspended because the villagers valued the abolished Lunar New Year. It will be resumed in late February."</p>
<p>Education Funding Will Be Independent</p>
<p>Finally, the reporter asked again, "According to the actual situation, although the current government is working hard to govern, various plans are often hindered by the poor level of knowledge of the people, who cannot understand or accept them, which greatly hinders progress. Therefore, popular education is the most important thing. Does your office have any plans for this?" Mr. Zhou said, "On this point, I have repeatedly advocated that the education funds of each county should be independent, and that the custody of the funds should not be handled by the county government. A 'Education Fund Custody Committee' should be organized, which is semi-official in nature, that is, the head of the education section of the county government, the chairman of the county education association, and the director of the school management committee should be ex officio members, plus local gentry, businessmen, and people enthusiastic about education, to jointly organize it, with a number of about five to seven people, responsible for the planning of education in the county and the custody of education funds. This method has also been approved by the district administrative meeting, submitted to the municipal government for record, and ordered by the office to be implemented in each county. Only because of time constraints and the inherent strong influence of the past, which is not easy to eradicate at once, those who implemented it have not yet seen it. He continued, "After the education funding problem is solved, we can gradually promote compulsory schools, public education centers, organize mobile libraries, promote adult and women's supplementary education, and literacy campaigns, so that illiteracy will be reduced, and the knowledge of the people can naturally be improved, which is of great importance to the promotion of national administration."</p>

<h3>Expectations of the Police Authorities – Speech at the Gift-Giving Ceremony on February 18th</h3>
<p>— Chen Binhe</p>
<p>The Shanghai police were founded in the fourth year of Xianfeng during the late Qing Dynasty, and have a long history of ninety-one years. During these ninety-one years, Shanghai has experienced countless changes and upheavals, but each time it has been able to get through smoothly. The greatest reason for this should be attributed to the efforts of the police to maintain public security. The Shanghai police have a glorious history in the past.</p>
<p>The police have the closest relationship with the people, as Secretary-General Luo has just explained very thoroughly. When Secretary-General Luo was in charge of Anhui, he encouraged civil servants to say that in the current difficult period, it is not enough for civil servants to treat the people with just the word "service." Civil servants must serve the people with the spirit of children caring for their parents. I am now saying the opposite: the police are the parental officials of the people. Parents love their children, so children will also think of their parents. Therefore, when former Deputy Director Su proposed the establishment of a police consumer cooperative last year, the Citizens' Welfare Association advanced a loan of more than 3 million yuan. Recently, due to the Lunar New Year, and because police officers have low salaries, heavy responsibilities, and difficult work, there is this gift-giving initiative. Although the amount of both times is not much, the motive is very sincere. This is a sincere expression of citizens thanking their closest parental officials. Whether Secretary-General Luo says that the police should serve the citizens with the spirit of filial sons, or whether I say that the police should seek the welfare of the citizens with the attitude of parental officials, in short, the police and the people are one family. In other words, the military, police, and people should be united as one. If this is the case, then Shanghai's public security in the future can be guaranteed; the glorious history of the Shanghai police in the past ninety-one years will therefore be further developed and expanded.</p>
<p>Today, standing in the position of citizens, we have two expectations for the Shanghai police:</p>
<p>First, we expect the police of Chinese nationality. In advanced countries, the police also have the responsibility of educating the people, that is, with good police, there will be good people. If every police officer can be dedicated to his duties and abide by the law, then the people can also abide by the law. Therefore, we hope that the police can serve as a model for our citizens, and exert their greatest strength in every position.</p>
<p>Second, we expect the Japanese police officers. Whether in terms of training or in terms of duties, the police of the allied nation Japan have always been famous throughout the world. In recent years, the Shanghai Police Department has been fortunate to have the participation of allied police experts, which is really a matter of congratulations. Last year, a high-ranking Japanese official serving in the Municipal Government asked me what expectations the Chinese have for Japanese people serving in Chinese agencies. My answer was: I hope that they can play a model role among Chinese civil servants. Therefore, we not only hope that the police of Chinese nationality will be a model for citizens, but also hope that Japanese police officers can be a model for Chinese police officers.</p>
<p>Finally, there is one more point to request. Before the Greater East Asia War, during the period when the British ruled the concessions, all the regulations of the patrol room and the attitude towards the people adopted imperialist methods of treating colonies. Because of the long time, there are inevitable deep-rooted problems, and there are still a very small number of Chinese and Japanese police officers who are still using the old methods. For example, the way they treat thieves, the way they treat the business community, and the way they treat intellectuals, regardless of the seriousness of the case, there is not much difference, which makes the people afraid to approach the police and afraid to step into the police station, just like they used to be afraid to approach the patrols and afraid to step into the patrol room. Now the times have changed, the concessions have been recovered, China and Japan are allied countries, and the police are the closest parental officials of the people. Those old ideas and old methods are no longer applicable; I hope that our police authorities and allied senior police officers will quickly correct them, so that the police and the people can be united as one, and like a family, jointly take on the responsibility of defending Greater Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Ling Hai Chang Publishes His Views on the War Situation</h3>
<p>(Continued from yesterday) Reporter asked: Please tell me about the actual progress of our country's new navy? (Minister replied) After the return of the National Government to the capital, based on a moral standpoint, the Allied nations successively returned coastal bases and naval vessels to our country, and cooperated in cultivating the new navy. Over the years, our navy has progressed from an embryonic stage to a new stage. During these years, this Ministry has actively trained naval officers and soldiers. Although the current strength is not yet sufficient to go out and attack the enemy, with the cooperation of the Allied naval authorities, the national coastal defense mission has been undertaken by our new navy. In the future, we will intensify the training of basic naval cadres in order to consolidate coastal defense and prevent the enemy from taking advantage of any gaps. In short, the construction work of our country's new navy has laid its new foundation. Recently, I went to Shanghai to inspect the Central Naval Academy, the Central Seamen Training Center, the Yonglu Survey Bureau, and other institutions. All the officers, soldiers, and students were full of energy and enthusiasm. After visiting the Allied naval authorities, they all expressed deep expectations for the construction of our new navy and were more willing to provide sincere assistance. Therefore, the future of our new navy is quite bright, which can be reported to the people of the country. (End)</p>

<h3>Soviet Attitude Towards Pacific Issues Remains Ambiguous</h3>
<p>Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency reports that a German government spokesperson declared on Saturday: Stalin is still employing extremely ambiguous policies regarding the Pacific and China, and his relationship with Chiang Kai-shek is highly questionable. This can be clearly seen from the attitude towards the Chongqing representatives at the Dumbarton Oaks Conference. When the Chongqing representatives were granted permission to participate in the conference, the Soviet representatives immediately left.</p>
<p>Roosevelt to Report on the Results of the Three-Power Conference</p>
<p>Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) – Reuters reports that President Roosevelt will present a detailed report to Congress on the Yalta Conference upon his return to Washington. According to the Washington correspondent of the Exchange Telegraph Company, Washington political circles expect that the President will answer various questions at the request of the congressmen. The President will also be asked to guarantee free elections in Poland and other Allied occupied countries. Other issues, such as the fate of the Baltic states and the Soviet Union's attitude towards the Pacific War, will also be discussed.</p>
<h3>India Demands Dominion Status</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 18th (Central News Agency) – Reuters from London reports that Sir Zafarullah Khan, leader of the Indian delegation, made a powerful appeal at the Federal Relations Conference yesterday, demanding that India be granted full dominion status.</p>
<h3>US Revokes Recognition of the Three Baltic States</h3>
<p>Madrid, 18th (German News Agency) – Washington reports that the US Treasury Department announced on Saturday that the three Baltic states are no longer recognized as independent countries.</p>
<h3>Battles Reach Climax on Northern Wing of the Western Front</h3>
<p>Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) – Reuters reports that the battles between the Rhine and Meuse rivers on the northern wing of the Western Front have reached their peak in the past 24 hours. Field Marshal Montgomery has redeployed the British Second Army to join the battle of Kleve.</p>
<h3>Soviet Forces Reorganizing, Preparing for New Offensive, German Counterattack in Upper Silesia</h3>
<p>Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) – Reuters reports that the most important aspect of the current situation in the central sector of the Eastern Front is that the Soviet command is currently deploying its troops. This is true not only for the units surrounding Breslau, but also for General Zhukov's forces on the Warthe River front. For a week, the Soviet military's objective has been to seize the crossings of the Warthe River, after which a large-scale offensive on Berlin could be launched. However, the Soviet military has stopped the offensive during this period and withdrawn a large number of troops. The only explanation for this is that the Soviet troops involved in the Poznan area are facing transportation difficulties, making it difficult to transfer sufficient reinforcements. The Soviet command is also diverting reinforcements from the Warthe River to the Pomeranian front, and there must be an urgent reason for this special operation. The offensive fronts of Fürstenberg and Küstrin are very narrow, only about fifty kilometers long. If General Zhukov continues to advance towards Berlin, his flanks will increase by another fifty kilometers, putting the Soviet military at risk of being attacked from both sides. Therefore, General Zhukov is not daring to launch an attack on the Warthe River at this time. His basic idea is to prepare and strengthen his offensive line as a prelude to a large-scale offensive on Berlin. The Soviet military's current threatening offensive from Steinau towards the Bober and Queis rivers, as well as the westward pressure between Glogau and Grünberg, are all for this reason. Powerful general forces are intercepting the Soviet offensive in various places, forcing it to halt. The Soviet offensive near Beuthen-Anhalt has also been blocked by a German counterattack.</p>

<h3>Citizens' Welfare Association Holds Presentation Ceremony for Military and Police Grant, Secretary-General Luo Attends on Behalf of the Mayor and Delivers Speech</h3>
<p>The Citizens' Welfare Association of this city, in view of the remarkable efforts of the municipal government in rectifying military and police discipline and maintaining local peace and stability, has presented 50 million yuan to the authorities on behalf of all citizens to express their sincere love and gratitude, to be used as a grant for the military and police. A presentation ceremony and tea party was held at the International Hotel yesterday (18th) at 4:00 PM, inviting officials from the Security Command and the Police Bureau, and bidding farewell to former Deputy Director of the Municipal Police Bureau, Mr. Su Chengde. Guests included Secretary-General Luo, representing Mayor Zhou, Chief of Staff Xiong from the Security Command, Deputy Director Lu from the Police Bureau, Inspector Watanabe, and Su Chengde. Hundreds of senior officers from the city's military and police agencies, as well as members of the Citizens' Welfare Association including Li Sihao, Wen Zhaoting, Yuan Ludeng, Lin Kanghou, Chen Binhe, Wu Yunzhai, Chen Shaowei, Zhang Deqin, Chen Riping, Hu Shouqi, Yin Tinghua, Pei Yunqing, Wang Boyuan, Fu Qiangeng, Song Zhuozai, Wang Yongkang, Sun Choucheng, Yang Heqing, Chen Panjun, Shen Weiya, Zhou Fuqing, Zhou Bangjun, Huang Yuzhai, Shen Weiting, Zheng Jianbo, Xia Deyang, Shen Chang, Zhang Bincun, and representatives from various trade associations, totaling over two hundred people, attended. The ceremony began with a speech by Li Sihao, explaining the significance of the military and police grant, followed by a farewell speech by Yuan Ludeng for Deputy Director Su, and a report by Lin Kanghou on the donation process. Subsequently, Secretary-General Luo and Deputy Director Su delivered speeches in response. Finally, Mr. Chen Binhe delivered a speech (the speech can be found in the leading article on the first page). Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Opening Speech by Li Sihao</p>
<p>"Distinguished guests: Since Mayor Zhou assumed office in Shanghai and concurrently served as the Director of the Police Bureau, the rectification of police discipline has brought a refreshing change to the citizens' perception. Furthermore, since Chief of Staff Xiong has been in charge of the Security Force since last year, there have been many innovations. At a time when the stability of the rear area is urgently needed, the military and police personnel responsible for maintaining law and order are facing even greater responsibilities. The Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association, standing in the position of representing the citizens, expresses gratitude for the military and police's rectification of discipline and encouragement for the military and police's maintenance of law and order. In particular, in order to express our appreciation for the contributions of the police officers at various branch bureaus of the Police Bureau, as well as the guidance and service of the senior police officers from our Allied nation, Japan, we have specially presented a grant to the military and police. Although the amount is small, we hope to express our heartfelt intentions through this. We hope that in the future, the military, police, and civilians can truly become one and be as harmonious as a family, working together towards the goal of maintaining Shanghai's overall security. We are holding this grant presentation ceremony here today, and we are grateful for your presence. I would like to explain the significance of this, and I hope you will accept it. Peace and stability are greatly desired; the citizens are greatly blessed."</p>
<p>Farewell Speech by Yuan Ludeng</p>
<p>"Distinguished guests: Today, the Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association is holding a grant presentation ceremony for the military and police, and at the same time, we are bidding farewell to Deputy Director Su of the Police Bureau. Deputy Director Su came to Shanghai to take office when the concessions were taken over in August of the year before last. He made many contributions to the merger of the police bureaus and the unification of police administration, and we express our deep gratitude. He is now being transferred to the position of Director of the Rural Pacification Affairs Bureau. Although the title has changed, he is still shouldering the responsibility for a portion of Shanghai's security. Therefore, speaking of his departure from the Police Bureau, it is a farewell; speaking of Shanghai's overall security, it is still a welcome. In the past, the general public had a negative perception of the Rural Pacification Affairs Bureau. Now, we hope that Director Su will actively reverse these negative impressions with his work achievements after taking office, and fulfill his responsibility for a portion of the city's security. This is what Shanghai is most hoping for. We wish Director Su all the best in his efforts and health."</p>
<p>Report by Lin Kanghou</p>
<p>"In this critical period, during last year's winter defense period, under the command and direction of the new mayor and the chief, we safely passed the Lunar New Year's Eve, which shows that things can be accomplished through human effort. To rectify discipline, it must start with the upper levels, and only then can the lower levels follow. Currently, the discipline of the military and police has been strictly rectified and is gradually improving. This time, various business and industry people in this city are holding this grant presentation to express their gratitude to the hardworking military and police personnel. This grant was presented to Secretary-General Luo at the Municipal Government on Lunar New Year's Eve by Mr. Wen Lanting and Mr. Chen Binhe. Today, we are holding this ceremony to show the sincerity of the business and industry communities to the military and police officers. Wise officials can love the citizens, and the military, police, and civilians can become one. The stability of Shanghai can then be ensured, and the people place their hopes on this. On behalf of the business and industry communities, I express our sincere gratitude to the wise officials."</p>
<p>Response Speech by Secretary-General Luo</p>
<p>"Today, I am honored to be here on behalf of the Mayor and all the colleagues of the Municipal Security Force and the Municipal Police Bureau to say a few words. The Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association has raised a substantial amount of money in a very short period of time to present to all the military and police personnel of the Security Force and the Police Bureau. We are deeply grateful in spirit and in our hearts. Originally, the state established the Security Force and the Police to protect local security. It is the inherent duty of the military and police to protect the local area and maintain law and order. The enthusiasm of the citizens of Shanghai gives us great encouragement, and the military and police personnel should work even harder to maintain law and order and protect the people, so that we can repay the citizens' deep love. Shanghai is a large city in our country, a large city in the East, and it can also be said to be one of the world's major metropolises. Therefore, doing evil in Shanghai is not only despised by the country and the people of the East, but also despised by the people of the world. We must be a role model for the people of the East, so that we will not be despised by the world. Our military and police personnel should fulfill their responsibilities with conscience and work hard to stabilize the security of Shanghai. In this critical period, the military and police of Shanghai have achieved some small successes in protecting the local area and loving the people, and the citizens of Shanghai have given us such encouragement. I am deeply grateful. When I was in the Anhui Provincial Government, I once warned my subordinates that it is not enough for today's military and police personnel to only serve the people. We must serve the country and society with the spirit of "sons being filial to their parents". Even when parents are critically ill, their children must still do their best to seek medical treatment and save them. Now the people are in deep water, and the people are the parents of the military and police personnel, and we should take on the spirit of children being filial to their parents, bear our responsibilities, relieve the people of their hardships, and strive to make the local area stable and the people live and work in peace. I represent the Security Force and all the personnel of the Police Bureau to thank the Citizens' Welfare Association and the citizens of Shanghai. No matter how things evolve in the future, our military and police colleagues will work even harder, regardless of success or failure. We have a clear direction and a firm determination. We will use our blood, sweat, and all our spirit to protect Greater Shanghai and do our best until the last drop of blood to complete the task of defending Greater Shanghai."</p>
<p>Response Speech by Deputy Director Su</p>
<p>"I am very grateful for the warm reception and farewell today, but I am unworthy of it. I have served as the Deputy Director of the Police Bureau for two years, and I am ashamed that I have not made any achievements. Although I am now being transferred to head the Rural Pacification Bureau, I am still responsible for ensuring the local security of Shanghai. Although the title is different, the goal and responsibility are still the same. In the future, all measures will be based on the motto of "public interest over private interest, society before the individual" that Mayor Zhou has shown us, and this will be our creed for serving and administering the government. Furthermore, at today's military and police grant presentation ceremony, I am reminded that when we planned to improve the lives of the police last year, the Police Bureau established a consumer cooperative. We deeply relied on the support of the people from all walks of life in Shanghai, especially Mr. Wen, Mr. Yuan, Mr. Lin, and Mr. Li. In a short period of time, we were able to succeed, and all the officers benefited greatly. I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude on their behalf. Although I am leaving the Police Bureau, I will continue to work hard for the security of Shanghai, and I hope you will not hesitate to give me guidance at all times."</p>

<h3>Price Assessment Committee Approves Audited Commodity Prices, to be Announced and Implemented Within Days</h3>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Economic Affairs, following the central government's decision to take emergency measures to re-evaluate the prices of general key commodities in the city, convened a joint meeting of the Price Assessment Committee the day before yesterday. Sixteen major commodities were put forward for discussion. The cost figures of various commodities reported by various trade associations were reviewed by specialist committee members, who then signed their assessment opinions. This task has been handled carefully and completed. The bureau convened a meeting of the Price Assessment Committee in the bureau's meeting room at 3:00 PM yesterday to make a final decision on the reviewed and approved prices. Committee members present at the assessment meeting included Yuan Junchang, Wang Deyan, Liu Xingchen, Yang Shi, Qin Tinggui, Man Qiwei, as well as committee members hired by the municipal government, including Wen Lanting, Yuan Ludeng, Lin Kanghou, Chen Ziyi, Luo Nazhai, Chen Binhe, Sun Zhongli, Chen Guoquan, Dai Ailu, and specialist committee members Cai Zhengya, Li Ze, Ling Pu, and others, totaling over twenty people. The meeting was personally presided over by Chairman Xu Jiang. After Mr. Xu reported the significance of the meeting, specialist committee members Cai Zhengya, Li Ze, and Ling Pu reported on the review process and explained the reasons for the increase or decrease in the assessed prices of the sixteen commodities. Subsequently, the committee members expressed their opinions and conducted a detailed study of the assessed prices. The results were quite satisfactory, and the sixteen assessed prices were unanimously approved according to their opinions. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM. The assessed prices will be announced and implemented within days.</p>
<h3>North Station Branch Bureau Cracks Down on Police Officers Buying Train Tickets on Behalf of Others</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Station Branch Bureau of the Police Bureau, in view of the fact that some police officers often take advantage of their positions to purchase train tickets from the ticket office of the North Station and various transportation companies, and then resell them at black market prices to single passengers, which affects legitimate travelers, deemed the situation to be hateful. Therefore, the bureau specifically notified the authorities at the North Station and various transportation companies in the city to refuse to sell tickets to police officers buying them on behalf of others and to report such cases at any time. Furthermore, the branch bureau chief, Liu Zhenzhong, secretly dispatched officers to investigate at various ticket offices. If the above situation was found, they were immediately brought to the bureau for investigation and prosecution. The aim is to benefit travelers.</p>
<h3>Financial, Industrial, and Commercial Conditions in Shanghai Last Week, Sharp Rise in Prices of Daily Necessities</h3>
<p>Last week, the financial, industrial, and commercial conditions in Shanghai were affected by the Lunar New Year's holiday, during which banks, businesses, and factories closed for year-end settlements. The market was only open on Monday and Saturday. Monday was Lunar New Year's Eve, the last day for banks to settle their accounts, and most external businesses were suspended. Securities and other markets had already announced their closure last Saturday. Therefore, there was little actual trading. On Saturday morning, the first trading day after the holiday, the situation was relatively good, and spot red copper, silver ingots, public bonds, and Shanghai stocks all trended upwards. Investors were actively absorbing funds, and trading was lively. Interest rates on interbank lending were quoted at six jiao, five fen lower than the previous week. In terms of industry and commerce, most factories were closed for the Lunar New Year holiday as usual. Companies and shops were also busy on Monday (Lunar New Year's Eve). Commodity prices rose sharply as merchants took advantage of the holiday season to raise prices, especially for miscellaneous glutinous rice flour and sugar. On Saturday, the first day of trading after the New Year, the market was relatively stable, and the price increases eased slightly because the municipal economic authorities were planning to take emergency measures to suppress prices and strictly crack down on and punish unscrupulous merchants who were speculating, manipulating, hoarding, and profiteering. At the same time, efforts were being made to dredge up sources of funds and adjust supply and demand, and there was considerable confidence in this.</p>
<h3>Russian Émigré Baojia Self-Defense Corps Established in Changshu District</h3>

The establishment and review ceremony was held at the Yongkang School Square on Yongkang Road at 11:00 AM yesterday (18th). Approximately 800 guests attended, including Captain Miyazaki of the Gendarmerie Shanghai South Team, senior staff officers from the Allied Army Department, Saito, Chief of the Foreign Affairs Section of the Police Bureau's Fourth Division, Deputy Chief Liu Wenzao, Director Shi of the Taishan Branch Bureau, Deputy Director Sugimoto of the Lujiawan Branch Bureau, the Chief of the Changshu District Chinese United Baojia, the chiefs of various United Baojia, and the Chief of the Changshu District Japanese Self-Defense Corps. Over 1,000 members of the Russian Émigré Self-Defense Corps, led by Corps Chief Gibertonsky, Vice Corps Chief Baoraofu, and Secretary Aimanofu, were reviewed by Chief Gu of the Police Bureau's Section A, Deputy Chief Okawa, Section Chief Hiraga of the Second Section, Branch Chief Yu, and Deputy Branch Chief Matsushita. The military music was sonorous, the marching was orderly, and the spirit was full. They also performed stretcher rescue, air defense, fire fighting, and other skills, which were praised by Chinese, Japanese, and Western guests. Finally, the reviewing officers gave speeches, with many warnings and encouragement. The meeting adjourned at around 12:00 noon. It is reported that the Russian Émigré Baojia Committee hosted a dinner party at the Ankai Hotel on Fumin Road last night (18th) to commemorate the establishment and to connect with officials from the municipal government and the police bureau.</p>
<h3>Retailers' Remaining Sugar Must Be Returned by Deadline</h3>
<p>The allocation of sugar for the 18th Rationing Period has ended. All retailers who have not sold out their sugar for that period should have it collected by the Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office for verification by the authorities. The office specifically notified all retailers yesterday that they must bring their sugar sales reports to the office to collect the Mobile Transfer Certificate before the 20th of this month, and then send the sugar, along with the original jars, to the Zhongfu Warehouse (the warehouses for collecting unsold sugar in the North and South Pudong districts will be notified separately by letter) for verification and acceptance. For sugar that is still in its original packaging, it will be accepted as long as the package has not been opened. For loose sugar, the actual amount will be calculated.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Group A Football League: Friendly Association and Shanghai Police, 1-1, Colors of Autumn Equally Divided</h3>
<p>The Group A football league match between the Friendly Association and the Shanghai Police took place yesterday morning at 10:00 AM at the Recreation Ground. The Friendly Association fielded a somewhat weakened team, and the result was a 1-1 draw, with the colors of autumn equally divided. With this draw, the Friendly Association lost two points in two matches, creating a situation of confrontation with the Portuguese Merchants team. The Shanghai Police kicked off. In the 17th minute, Shanghai Police's Yu Liming passed to Monno, who lifted the ball into the middle. Little Huangmao deftly broke through and powerfully struck the ball into the net, giving the Shanghai Police a 1-0 lead.

<h3>A Record of the Exhibition of Ancient and Modern Calligraphy and Painting</h3>
<p>— Mei Wen</p>
<p>The Exhibition of Ancient and Modern Calligraphy and Painting, sponsored by Shen Bao, opened on the 16th at the Chinese Painting Academy on Chengdu Road. Because there were about three hundred pieces of calligraphy and painting on display, I didn't want to miss the opportunity to feast my eyes, so I went to visit. Although I am a layman, after appreciating so many calligraphy and paintings, I felt that I had gained something, and I thought it was worth introducing it.</p>
<p>There were many works in this exhibition, filling the Chinese Painting Academy's hall. The artists included those from ancient and modern times, from the North and the South, including Shi Tao, Liu Shian, Wang Wenzhi, Zeng Guofan, Wu Dazheng, Kang Youwei, Zhang Taiyan, Zheng Xiaoxu, Xu Shichang, and in recent times, Ye Gongchuo, Wu Hufan, Zhang Daqian, and Pu Xinyu. Quite a few gentlemen and ladies visited, making the小姐who signed people in very busy. However, the atmosphere in the venue was very quiet, because every guest was quietly gazing at each artistic masterpiece.</p>
<p>In the first room, Chen Shaomei from Tianjin and Ms. Bei Zhaoyu from Suzhou's landscape paintings were displayed prominently. Chen's achievements are very profound. The various paintings such as "Imitation of Qiu Shizhou's Green Mountain and Green Water" and "Winter Forest Picture" are all steady and balanced. "Old Man Fangxi's Small Piece" has a sparse and pleasing composition, with the remaining spirit of the Song Dynasty, and is truly a rare work. Next to Liu Shian's cursive script, I discovered Zhu Yizun's running script. Zhu's works are rarely seen. It had already been purchased by a gentleman. There are indeed people who know their value.</p>
<p>In the second row, the works of Ye Gongchuo, Zhang Daqian, Wu Hufan and others were hung. Ye Gongchuo's monochrome bamboo scroll, with its flowing brushstrokes, has a free and unrestrained trend. As for his huge running script, its momentum is majestic and its structure is rigorous. It has long been well-established in the contemporary art world. Wu Hufan's "Yan Tan's Spring Morning" hand scroll, displayed in a glass cabinet, with its beautiful springs and rocks and towering peaks, fully demonstrates his skill and can indeed be called a masterpiece.</p>
<p>The low price of this exhibition can also be considered one of its attractions. Especially in terms of calligraphy, the works of Zheng Xiaoxu, Liu Shian, Zhang Taiyan, Wang Wenzhi, Yu Quyuan, and Liang Qichao have always been valued by people, and almost all of them were only selling for four or five thousand yuan apiece. A couplet by Old Man Sanyuan was only selling for two thousand yuan. It is no wonder that most of them were purchased. In a corner of the last room hung a seven-character couplet by Yuan Shikai: "Willing to work hard and fight, do not judge success or failure by thirds." The price was marked at 10,000 yuan, but the calligraphy did not show much skill. Perhaps collecting this couplet has historical value in addition to its artistic cultivation, as it is Yuan Shikai's own account of his joys and sorrows.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to specifically mention Pu Xinyu's small figure scrolls, Qian Shoutie's colored landscape paintings, Wang Yiting's Buddha statues, and Zhao Shuju's flower paintings, which each have their own style and are truly extraordinary.</p>
