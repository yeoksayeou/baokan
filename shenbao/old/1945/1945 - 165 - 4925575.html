<p>東京十三日中央社電日首相鈴木大將，因第八十七屈臨時議會閉幕，特於十三日上午十一時，於首相官邸招待兩院議長德川·島田兩氏聲貴，衃兩院議員及政府委員，席間致詞如下：「余於海軍時代，爲炸彈傷耳，兼之生性拙於辭令，故回顧本届議會之經過，余實未能將所欲言者儘情告諸各位，然余書夜不能取忘者，爲於作戰到底之決意下，如何充分發揮全部國力，集中於此一戰，幸而承各位協贊之各議案中，尤其戰時緊急措置之成立，政府責任突然加重，願適切應用，特別努力，實施一切有關作戰到底之施策，期不負諸位之信賴」。</p>
<h3>島尻及小祿方面　均展開激烈戰鬥　日陸相電謝沖繩島官民</h3>
<p>琉球基地十二日中央社電冲繩本島陸上戰鬥，據守該島最南端島尻地區新主要陣地之日軍，與進迫之敵軍間展開激戰，同時小祿方面戰况亦頗緊急。島尻地區日軍主要陣地前面之敵軍，自八日以來，在西部，中央及東部地區，各集中兵力五百至一千名。又在凑川方面派新兵力登陸，準備發動攻勢。自十一日以來，對日軍地區開始總攻擊，日軍守備部隊邀擊優勢敵軍或集中砲火，或挺身衝殺，使敵損警益重。東海岸方面具志頭終於陷入敵手，八重瀨岳與座岳方面，兩軍相距咫尺，短兵相接，激戰正酣，小祿方面敵軍攻勢亦頗熾烈，藉航空部隊掩護，逐次侵入日軍陣地，十一日敵軍迫近日軍主要陣地，展開戰鬥。</p>
<p>東京十三日中央社電日阿南陸相，　三月二十五日敵於慶良間列島登陸，侵犯冲繩以來，冲繩日縣民與將兵一體協力，奮鬥擊滅敵美，迄今猶在艱苦之戰局下奮鬥，其至誠純忠，深可感激，十二日特對島田冲繩縣知事及全體縣民，發出　篤之感謝激勵電報，其內容如下：「仇敵登陸以來，縣知事及縣民各位，舉全力協力軍隊，至誠盡忠，奮鬥擊滅敵軍，衷心感激之至，特表深甚之謝意」。</p>
<p>中央社訊　美第五十八機動部隊司令官密却海軍中將，因有一月之休假期，業已返國，十一日會見新聞記者團時談構，吾人愈接近日本本土，則日軍之抵抗愈强，冲繩作戰即為絕好證例，僅利用轟炸，不能求太平洋作戰勝利，吾人爲戰勝日本，今後必須更有步兵協助云。美地上軍本部長史蒂維爾上將曾稱，在冲繩將有更慘烈之陸上戰鬥，密却之言亦對此而發，表示贊意。</p>
<h3>藤井少佐等　晉級授勛</h3>
<p>東京十三日中央社電於東京西南諸島及南洋方面壯烈戰死之藤井少佐等日空軍烈士十四人，前已授與感狀，並達上聞，本日日陸軍省發表，天皇陛下又各賜特別晉級之恩典，又於西南諸島殉國之森澤準尉等，亦分別頒賜恩賞。</p>
<h3>黑島中尉等　表彰殊勳</h3>
<p>東京十三日中央社電日海軍省頃公布，橫須賀海軍航空隊黑烏四朗中慰，倉本十三上等飛行軍曹，於去冬以來之來襲日本本土之B29型敵機邀擊戰中，擊落其六架，擊毀其二架，更於本月五日，二十五日夜之敵大編隊來襲時，以「月光」機單機突入敵羣，舉擊落五架擊皺一架之煊煌戰果，特由戶塚橫須賀鎮守府司令長官布告全軍，表彰其殊勛。</p>
<h3>日戰鬥機優秀</h3>
<p>瑞典京城十三日中央社電瑞典日報六月五日就日新銳機發表如下：本月四日，以艦　機空襲日九州地區之斯特倫少佐，於琉球海面之旗艦甲板談謂：「迎戰余等之日戰鬥機速度極大，決非我等飛機所能望其項背，日機曾對我等議決，」其他總駛員亦　口同音謂：「日戰鬥機較我等所乘之機優秀數倍」云云。</p>
<h3>奪回馬爾機場日均作戰實況</h3>
<p>南方前綫基地十三日中央社電敵近因太平洋戰綫補給路困難，極感頭痛，且自美本土至冲繩途中之菲島，所羅門，新幾內亞，馬里亞納等補給路，亦囚日軍活躍，致後方亦受牽制，感極大阻礙，而日軍於自四月下旬開始之奪回馬爾機塲作戰，復獲預期成效，使敵新幾內亞航空要塞潰滅一角。日軍從事此次作戰之指揮官，其部隊長日昨歸還，談述作戰實况如次：新幾內亞乃由密林地帶與蛇行其間之泥河及不可攀登之岩石相連，且濕氣甚大，於此自然之障礙中，食糧尚感不足，然日軍將兵戰意異常吒盛，乃將馬爾機塲完全攻佔。四月下旬，我軍部隊於新幾內亞北岸計劃作戰後，自野營地踴躍出發，各軍皆帶有子彈，四十日份食糧，繼續困難行軍，約四十日間，乃得到達馬爾機塲，當時將兵之面孔因汗與塵土相黏，皆變成黑色，與當地住民幾無分別，我等當時以捨身戰術，開始攻擊，敵軍則因我方潛行挺身隊及肉搏隊之猛攻，并未抵抗，即全行潰退，我軍正於其附近展開掃蕩戰中。</p>
<h3>論江蘇省食糧增產問題</h3>
<p>— 陳耀溪</p>
<p>緒言</p>
<p>吾中華以農立國已四千餘年，對食糧之供求理應自給自足，乃因不事提倡，不求改食，不善統制，致農菜社會逐漸崩潰，農村經濟日趨枯竭，大好農業國之食糧，反須仰給於外洋，是以食糧之由海外輸入者，平均年達三萬萬元以上，坐失利權，誠令人痛心疾自。</p>
<p>事　後外洋　入旣告斷絕，食糧供應逐漸感缺乏，即以食米一項而論，其價格每石竟達百萬元，與民國二十五年之糙粳七元餘，白粳八元左右相較，勝貴達十萬倍以上，雖近年百物皆貴，惟其指數無食米之鉅，故食糧之上漲實駕乎任何生活必需品之上。國府有鑒於斯，已列「增加生產」爲三大施策之一，以謀食糧問題之根本解決。</p>
<p>江蘇省為吾國中部之主要產米區，其每年平均產米量佔全國產米總量百分之十一以上，尤以揚十江南岸一帶，有長江太湖縱橫其間，水通密布灌漑便利，氣候溫和土質肥沃，素有「魚米之鄉」之稱，於國府治下之物質供應立塲上言之，實佔極大之比重，而增加江南地區之農業生產，亦已列爲今後江蘇省府施政重點之一。故江蘇省食職增產問題，自有亟加檢討之必要，然目前增產計劃雖多，如疏通運輸，撤消捐稅，實行憑　，取締囤積等，凡此消極之治標方法，能切指利弊而美滿與永久者，百不得一。爰不惴　陋草成斯篇，深望海內鴻碩不吝賜教，曷勝欣幸。</p>
<p>江蘇省食糧生產狀</p>
<p>况之過去與現在</p>
<p>按江蘇省於事變前有水田三千三百六十萬畝，年產米八千二百五十萬右，平均每畝產米二·四五石。事變後建設廳雖每年嚴令各縣，將重要農作物之栽培面積及產量理查呈報，惟各縣之技藝人員既感缺乏，經濟又不充裕，致所得數字不能完全利用。江南各縣食糧之生產狀况如何，除約略估計外別無他法。江蘇省之江南與江北雖僅一江之隔，惟自然環境，土質水利，辦作狀况，農村經濟等均相去懸殊，農實况言之，則江南二十一縣之水田面積，至少佔全省水田總面積之二分之一，即一千五百萬畝以上。茲用下述方法對江南各縣稻產，作一大略估計。</p>
<p>根據江蘇省財政廳，民國三十二年統計之各縣額征田畝數，作爲各縣總耕地面積。此統計之數字內雖含有一部份宅地，荒地，　地等非生產地面積，唯各縣對額征田畝數之統計，住心理影響類皆以多報少，故統計之精確於權衡下離事實尚近。</p>
<p>湖南省爲我國最豐富之產米區，江蘇之江南各縣亦可與之媲美，而一部份之縣區且有過之無不及。據立法院統計處張心一氏估計。湖南省水田面積佔耕地總面積約百分之六十六，故假定江南各縣耕地面積平均百分之七十爲水田面積。</p>
<p>根據一·上海銀行商品調查最刊第一編「米」號之推算，江蘇省每畝平均產米量二·○七石。二·上述每畝平均產米量二·四五石。假定每畝之平均產米量爲二·二五石。</p>
<p>江蘇省江南二十一縣產米爲表。</p>
<p>吳縣·宜興·太倉。溧陽·金山·無錫·常熟·高淳·江陰·江寗·揚中·吳江·武通·句容·昆山·松江·鎮江·靑浦·丹陽·金　·深水有水田一千五百三十萬畝，年產米三千四百四十萬石。事變後因農村受戰事影響及萑苻滋擾，江蘇省農產力驟品名　一九三六年收量（千擔）米　一·〇二三·二〇二小麥　四六三·三五三栗　一三五·四八七高梁　一五三·八〇九查一九三六年以前，戰事僅波及華北及華中之京滬一帶，江南各縣復爲此地帶中之主要產米區域，而食米之減產比率竟佔各食糧中之首位，可見江南農村受戰事影響之嚴重。若以江南各縣之估計產米量，按減產比率折算，則江南產米量實僅二千七百九十萬石。設男人每日食米八合，女人每日食米六合，平均每人每日以七合行滅低，其此率數字若干，我人無法得之。惟民國二十八年農本局會就一九三六年（戰前）與一九三八年（戰後），各種重要食糧作物之收獲量作一比較如下表：一九三八年收量（千擔）百分比八二·二三二　八一％二〇六·四八三　四五％五九·一〇一　五八％二六·四四一　二〇％　三六·一七〇　二三％計算，則每人年需食米二。五石左右，二千七百九十萬石米約可供一千一百餘萬人之一年食糧。按人民於戰後大量集中於江南一帶之情形觀之，江南二十一縣之人口決不止此數，雖全部人口並非皆以稻爲主要食糧，惟食米之不敷分配已無庸異議。是則江南農村生產力之亟應恢復，當視爲今後江蘇省府之重大事業，實急不容緩也</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>迅速解決糧食問題</h3>
<p>最近由於米價的狂漲不已，領導一般物價亦步亦趨，猶如火勢燎原，漫無止境，一般人民，尤其是薪水階級升斗小民，都感到生活的重壓，引起莫大的恐慌。我們認爲在這樣的嚴重狀熊下，首先趕快決定緊急對策，從速實施，而緊急對策的內容，務必切實易行，速見成效。</p>
<p>在目前嚴重時局之下，無論從任何觀點言，必須集結總力，貢獻於爭取勝利的一個目標，這已是無可置疑了。而目前的米糧問題以至物價問題，足以威脅民生，足以影響集結總力，因之，對這問題，絕對不能任其自然，更不允許一再拖延，而應針對問題的　結，速籌搶救對策。</p>
<p>另一方面，我們更希望人民對於米價暴漲，不必過份恐慌，因爲這次米價暴漲，畢竟是不合理的，只要速籌緊急對策，對症下藥，至少可以阻遏不合理的暴漲程度。同時，在消極方面，大家應即改變非米不可生存的觀念，而採用雜糧果腹，以减少米糧恐慌的程度。</p>
<p>大部分雜糧尚不在統制之列，採購運輸均可自由，即各地已經運滬雜糧，數量亦不在少，在客觀原因上，雜糧價格與米價並不發生一致的聯　影響，而目前雜糧價格卻隨米價比例暴漲，我們研究所以致此的癥結所在，實山於放任不管，因此，雜糧價格的同時暴漲，實爲無政府狀熊的現象。希望當局趕快抑止雜糧價格，並從速向淮海等產地，採購平　。</p>
<p>此外，對於米糧的收買方式，我們始終認爲有改皺之必要，如果不加根本的合理變革，則糧食問題，勢將治絲益棼，難期好轉。在戰時採取統制經濟政策，已爲必然的原則，無可非議，我們所主張的改善，幷不是統制政策原則的變更，而是統制技術的變革。由於收買方式的未盡合於國情民情，因而增加米糧問題的嚴重性，我們感於這種繩騐的教訓，更主張不能不從速改善統制技術。統制技術一且改善，人民對於糧食問題的解決自必寄以新的期待，從而緩和恐慌心理。</p>
<p>以言改善統制技術，當然希望國府當局負起責任，考慮整個計劃，同時，希望盟邦關係當局極力協助，促成計劃實現。惟有中日當局抱人飢己飢人溺己溺之心，共同協力執行，才能獲致改善的實效。</p>
<p>我們曾經說過：只要中國當局的力量，盟邦駐華當局的力量，民間領導的力量一致凝結，則一切載關，都能克服。」今日要迅速抑平米價，調劑食糧，只有希望這三種力量一政團結，並力以赴。</p>

<h3>敵機盲炸香港　被擊落三架　徐州前日亦遭受空襲</h3>
<p>香港十三日中央社電十二日上午十時二十分，敵B24型機五十八架，B29型機一架，P38型機一架來襲香港地區，對市　中心區域投下燒夷彈及炸彈，直至十二時左右始行　去，經日軍陸上砲火擊落B24型機三架。</p>
<p>徐州十二日中央社電　敵P51型機七架，於十一日上午十一時五十分，侵入本市上空，對機塲以機槍掃射，經我地上防空砲火猛擊，僅盤旋數分鐘即倉皇向西南遁走，經調查敵機一架中彈，擊落於郊外南方三官廟附近，我方毫無損害。</p>

<p>瑞典京城十三日中央社電據路透社某外交訪員昨稱：倫敦官方將於最近期內，頒發一關於波蘭問題之文告，然該文告之詳細內容，外界人尚不能知悉。目前根據可　方而消息，特魯曼總統之私人特使霍浦金；曾將自十六各波蘭要人被捕後一直擱淺至今之英美蘇談判恢復進行。然該訪員復稱，若欲恢復此項解決蘇波難題之談判，則第一步必爲召開會議。</p>
<h3>歐戰犧牲重大兵員傷亡統計</h3>
<p>里斯本十三日中央社電歐戰於各國龐大琉血與物資消耗之中業告終結，五月六日之「紐約時報」曾以「　大之犧牲」爲題，論述如次：歐洲戰爭開始直至結束，共經五年六閱月，於此期間中之龐大流血與物資消耗，乃歷史上所罕見。據最可靠之計算，於歐洲戰域所損失之人員，計達九百萬至一千萬，此外因戰傷而殘廢者約有九百萬至一千萬，負輕傷者亦達數百萬，俘虜約一千二百餘萬。兩陣營之損害大致相同，均在一千五百萬左右，其中三分之二以上，概爲蘇聯之損害。美軍於歐洲之損害，約計七十萬，其中陣亡者爲十四萬五千，一般非戰鬥員之死傷者，約在數百萬以上，此外因身心之消耗，不能營昔通生活者，亦達庸大之數目。關於非戰門員之死傷，尚無正確之統計，然其中一部即因蒙敵機轟炸及火箭砲報復一號報復二號之攻擊而死亡者，僅美國之非戰門員達十四萬五千名。</p>
<p>歐陸大戰聯軍損害　瑞典京城十三日中央社電歐洲聯合軍司令部發表，去年六月六日至歐戰告終，於歐洲戰塲之損害如次：「英國與加拿大軍」陣亡三九。五九九名，負傷一二六·五四五名，失蹤一八·三六八名，共計一八四·五一二各。「美軍」陣亡八九·四七七各，負傷三六七·一八二各·失蹤五七·八七七名，共計五一四。五三六名。「特戈爾軍」陣亡一一·〇八〇名，負傷四五。九六大名，失蹤四。二〇一名，共計六一·二四七名。「彼蘭軍」陣亡一·一八九名，負傷四·〇二九名，失蹤三七五名，共計五·五九三名。上列數字，其空軍損害尚不在內。據美從軍記者報告稱，歐戰告終當時，聯合軍之兵力共九十一部團，其中六十師團即三分二之兵力係美軍，又稱，美國派遣於歐洲之兵力計五軍，英國加拿大與特戈爾合爲一師團。</p>

<p>曹娥江畔</p>
<p>因候車無着，致在紹興逗留五日，始於五月十九日離紹，前往寗詖。是晨七時於細雨濛濛巾，趨車往汽車站，佇候購票，軍應於九時半開行，但以木炭升火需時，又恐中途拋　，故行前試東者再，　於十時一刻於大雨滂沱中開行，公路至不平坦，復因天雨滂沱，車身　　尤以過橋時為甚。全程山岳連綿不絕，距曹娥江三十里處有「長流村」，其地之「長山」，山土係紅色與山頭之　林，相映趣，堪稱特色。</p>

<p>據百官係浙江上　縣之一鎮，居民約兩萬餘人，類多以種田捕漁爲生，非農忙時期，鄉民婦女亦多以編織草鞋草帽等爲臨時副業。距百官六十里之湯浦與章家浦，及相隔三十里之「上浦」向產絲茶，農民閒時以此項土產，運在遠方販賣，以博利徵。</p>
<p>最近以四鄉不靖，上虞縣及其他附屬機關，皆遷移來此，故　頭驟多軍醫及公務人員，常地祇有大街一條狹窄異常，市面冷落，完全是農村氣慨。出產則以麥黃豆玉黍爲大宗，物價較紹興爲廉。記者抵達時當日物價米每擔十四萬元，（次等米十三萬五千元）猪肉每斤一千七百六十元，雞每斤一千六百元，生油每斤二千四百元，軟柴每斤十二元，硬柴十五元。</p>
<p>民生一斑</p>
<p>記奢於次日淸晨前往停車廠探聽汽車消息，目睹農　及幼童多人管携米包，擁集檢問所旁，行色食皇，候機偷渡，奇而詢之，據告彼等為對江曹娥廟一帶之居民，以當地不產稻米，故其價格（十六萬元）較百官爲貴。來鎮糶米携歸煮飯，不圖受阻於檢間所，不予放行。旋記者又問彼等平日生活狀況，據謂曹娥　附近四週村落年來收成欠佳，故彼等除料理家務外，仍須努力帮同家人耕種田畝，以期農作物產量增加，茲以早麥（即大麥）尚未能收，於此靑黃不接之際。經濟至感困難。彼等什九以一餐果腹，餘則以麥　糊口，生活困苦，可見一斑。</p>

<h3>新聞協會昨茶會　歡迎桑原部長　互以團結一致克服困難相勉</h3>
<p>中國新聞協會上海區分會爲歡迎新任日駐華艦隊報道部長　原大佐·特於昨（十三）日下午假華　飯店舉行茶會招待，桑原部長準時偕同松本大尉等蒞會，由中國新聞協會上海區分會理事長陳彬龢等接待，各報社到尾坂與市·森山喬·陳日平·許力求·金雄白·陸光杰·倪蝶蓀·翁永淸·魯風·楊廻浪·鄭介等百餘人。首由陳彬龢致歡迎詞，次由桑原部長致答謝詞，並披瀝抱負，賓主情緒熱烈，至四時許始散。今天中國新聞協會上海區分會，茶會歡迎艦隊報道部蔡原部長，承蒙光臨，非常欣幸。桑原部長在中國服務多年，熟悉中國情形，中國友人極多。過去對於中日合作的促進工作，備極努力。我們和桑啄部長相交已久，友</p>
<p>陳理事長致歡迎詞誼素篇，今後和新聞界的關係，更加密切，尤爲欣幸。目前時局日趨緊張，新聞界的責任也日益重大，可是，我深信如果以中日兩國政府的力量，再加上中日兩國民間的力量，團結一致，那末，一切困難都可以克服的。</p>
<p>宜傳報道工作，在目樣和方針上，第一需要統一，惟有信念堅定，步伐一致，才能產生力量。目前我們上海新聞界同人，團結的精神，可說在事變前所未見的，而協力的態度，也是空前的。其次，新聞界與報道機關間的合作，尤極密切，這都是極好的現象。現在更有熟悉中國情形，又是我們的老友桑原先生，出任艦隊報道部長，給我們指導協助，我們深信今後的宣傳工作，更能步伐一致，更能密切協力。</p>
<p>桑原部長致答謝詞桑原艦隊報道部長致謝詞，略謂：此次松島部長榮轉，本人暫行兼代其職務，今日承新聞協會舉行茶會招待，頃復承陳理事長多所誇獎，實深感謝。誠如陳理事長所言，本人在中國服務年代相當長久，不過時間雖長，對於中國一切情形尚不能謂爲精通明瞭。本人在中國期間、結識中國友人甚多，彼此之間，口頭上常流露着「中日親善」的一句話。對於中日親善問題，並曾盡過很大的努力，但結果此一問題的發展，與所期待者適相反。其中固有種種原因，但中日人士未能充分認識其對象，要爲原因之一。爲使中日兩國澈底際解，必須由興論界起而指導與奮鬥。今日在座諸位，均爲興論界權威，藉各位之努力，使中日爾國澈底認職與瞭解。實爲唯一之希望。本人此次旣兼長報道任務，個人之抱負，亦本此旨努力，務望不吝賜教，目前時局已趨嚴重階段，盼望一致團結，達此目的。</p>

<h3>The Eighty-Seventh Extraordinary Session of the Diet Holds Closing Ceremony Yesterday Morning; Japanese Prime Minister Reaffirms Resolve to Fight to the End</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – The closing ceremony of the eighty-seventh extraordinary session of the Japanese Diet was held at ten o'clock this morning in the House of Peers. In the presence of all cabinet ministers, the vice presidents of both houses, Tokugawa, Shimada, Sakai, and Katsuta, and members of both houses, Prime Minister Suzuki reverently read the gracious imperial message. Subsequently, Tokugawa, the Speaker of the House of Peers, respectfully expressed gratitude for the imperial message. The closing ceremony concluded at ten o'clock.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – Upon the occasion of the closing ceremony of the eighty-seventh extraordinary session of the Japanese Diet, the imperial message was bestowed as follows:</p>
<p>"We inform the members of both the House of Peers and the House of Representatives that We have today ordered the closure of the Imperial Diet and commend you for understanding Our intentions and exerting yourselves to support emergency bills."</p>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – On the occasion of the closing of the eighty-seventh extraordinary session of the Diet, Prime Minister and General Suzuki invited the speakers of both houses, Tokugawa and Shimada, as well as members of both houses and government officials, to the Prime Minister's official residence at eleven o'clock on the morning of the thirteenth. During the reception, he delivered the following address: "During my time in the navy, I suffered ear damage from a bomb, and I am also naturally inept at oratory. Therefore, looking back on the course of this session of the Diet, I have not been able to fully convey what I wanted to say to everyone. However, what I cannot forget day and night is how to fully utilize all of our national strength under the resolve to fight to the end, and to concentrate it on this one battle. Fortunately, among the bills that you have all supported, especially the establishment of wartime emergency measures, the government's responsibility has suddenly increased. We wish to appropriately apply these measures and make special efforts to implement all policies related to fighting to the end, in order to live up to your trust."</p>
<h3>Fierce Battles Unfold in Shimajiri and Oroku Areas; Japanese Army Minister Cables Thanks to Officials and Civilians on Okinawa Island</h3>
<p>Ryukyu Base, 12th (Central News Agency) – Regarding the land battles on Okinawa Island, the Japanese forces defending the southernmost Shimajiri district of the island, which is their main new position, are engaged in fierce battles with the approaching enemy forces. At the same time, the situation in the Oroku area is also quite urgent. The enemy forces in front of the main Japanese positions in the Shimajiri area have concentrated forces of 500 to 1,000 men each in the western, central, and eastern districts since the 8th. They have also landed new forces in the Minatogawa area in preparation for launching an offensive. Since the 11th, they have launched a general attack on the Japanese-held area. The Japanese defending forces have either ambushed the superior enemy forces with concentrated artillery fire or engaged in suicidal charges, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. On the east coast, Gushichan has finally fallen into enemy hands. In the Yaese-dake and Yoza-dake areas, the two armies are only a short distance apart, engaging in close combat, and the battle is raging fiercely. The enemy offensive in the Oroku area is also quite intense. Under the cover of air units, they are gradually infiltrating the Japanese positions. On the 11th, the enemy forces approached the main Japanese positions and began fighting.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Army Minister Anami issued a heartfelt telegram of gratitude and encouragement to Governor Shimada of Okinawa Prefecture and all the prefecture's residents on the 12th. This was because, since the enemy landed on the Kerama Islands on March 25th and invaded Okinawa, the residents of Okinawa Prefecture have cooperated with the soldiers as one to fight and annihilate the American enemy, and they are still fighting in a difficult battle situation. Their utmost sincerity and loyalty are deeply appreciated. The contents of the telegram are as follows: "Since the landing of the enemy, the governor and all the residents of the prefecture have exerted all their strength to cooperate with the military, demonstrating utmost sincerity and loyalty, and fighting to annihilate the enemy forces. We are deeply grateful and express our deepest thanks."</p>
<p>Central News Agency Report – Vice Admiral Mitscher, commander of the U.S. 58th Task Force, has returned home for a month's leave. During an interview with a group of reporters on the 11th, he stated that the closer we get to the Japanese mainland, the stronger the Japanese resistance becomes. The Okinawa operation is a perfect example of this. Bombing alone cannot win the Pacific War. To defeat Japan, we must have more infantry assistance in the future. General Stilwell, Chief of the U.S. Ground Forces, has stated that there will be even more brutal land battles on Okinawa. Mitscher's words also express agreement with this.</p>
<h3>Major Fujii and Others Promoted and Decorated</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – Fourteen air force martyrs, including Major Fujii, who died valiantly in the southwestern islands near Tokyo and in the South Seas, have previously been awarded citations and reported to the Emperor. Today, the Japanese Army Ministry announced that His Majesty the Emperor has also bestowed upon each of them the special grace of promotion. Also, Petty Officer Morisawa and others who died in the southwestern islands were also awarded honors.</p>
<h3>Lieutenant Kuroshima and Others Commended for Distinguished Service</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Navy Ministry recently announced that Lieutenant Kuroshima Shiro of the Yokosuka Naval Air Corps and Petty Officer 1st Class Kuramoto Juso have shot down six and damaged two B-29 enemy aircraft during the interception battles against enemy aircraft that have been attacking the Japanese mainland since last winter. Furthermore, on the night of the 5th and 25th of this month, when a large enemy formation attacked, they used a "Gekko" aircraft to single-handedly break into the enemy formation, achieving the glorious results of shooting down five aircraft and damaging one. They were specially commended for their distinguished service by the commander of the Totsuka-Yokosuka Naval Base, who issued a notice to the entire army.</p>
<h3>Japanese Fighter Planes Excellent</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 13th (Central News Agency) – The Swedish newspaper, Svenska Dagbladet, published the following about the new Japanese aircraft on June 5th: Major Strömlin, who led the carrier aircraft that attacked the Kyushu region of Japan on the 4th of this month, said on the deck of his flagship in the waters off Okinawa: "The speed of the Japanese fighter planes that met us was extremely fast, and our aircraft could not hope to match it. The Japanese planes had resolved to engage us." Other chief officers also said in unison: "Japanese fighter planes are several times better than the aircraft we are flying."</p>
<h3>Actual Situation of the Japanese Military's Operation to Recapture Mäll Airport</h3>
<p>Southern Frontline Base, 13th (Central News Agency) – The enemy is suffering from headaches due to the difficulty of supplying the Pacific front lines. Moreover, the supply lines from the United States to Okinawa through the Philippines, Solomon Islands, New Guinea, and Mariana Islands are also being constrained by the active Japanese forces, causing great obstacles to the rear. The Japanese military's operation to recapture Mäll Airport, which began in late April, has achieved the expected results, causing a corner of the enemy's New Guinea air base to collapse. The commander of the Japanese forces engaged in this operation, along with his unit commander, returned yesterday and described the actual situation of the operation as follows: New Guinea is connected by dense jungle areas, meandering mud rivers, and unscalable rocks, and the humidity is very high. In this natural obstacle, food is still insufficient. However, the morale of the Japanese soldiers is extraordinarily high, and they have completely occupied Mäll Airport. In late April, after our army units planned the operation on the north coast of New Guinea, they set out from the camp with enthusiasm. Each army carried bullets and food for forty days, continuing the difficult march for about forty days, and then reached Mäll Airport. At that time, the faces of the soldiers were covered in black due to the sweat and dust, and they were almost indistinguishable from the local residents. We then began the attack with a suicide tactic. The enemy forces did not resist due to the fierce attacks of our infiltrating commando and hand-to-hand combat teams, and they all retreated. Our army is currently carrying out a mopping-up operation in the vicinity.</p>
<h3>On the Issue of Increasing Food Production in Jiangsu Province</h3>
<p>— Chen Yaoxi</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Our China has been established as an agricultural nation for more than four thousand years, and the supply and demand of food should be self-sufficient. However, due to the lack of promotion, the lack of efforts to change dietary habits, and the lack of sound control, the agricultural society has gradually collapsed, and the rural economy has become increasingly depleted. The food of a great agricultural country must instead be supplied from overseas. Therefore, the average annual import of food from overseas reaches more than 300 million yuan, a complete loss of rights and interests, which is truly heartbreaking and alarming.</p>
<p>The import of food from overseas has now been cut off, and the food supply is gradually becoming scarce. Taking rice as an example, the price per stone has reached one million yuan, compared with about seven yuan for coarse rice and about eight yuan for white rice in 1936, which is more than 100,000 times more expensive. Although the price of everything has risen in recent years, the index is not as large as that of rice. Therefore, the rise in food prices is actually above any other essential commodity. In view of this, the national government has listed "increasing production" as one of the three major policies in order to fundamentally solve the food problem.</p>
<p>Jiangsu Province is the main rice-producing area in central China. Its average annual rice production accounts for more than 11% of the total national rice production, especially in the area south of the Yangtze River in Yangzhou, where the Yangtze River and Lake Taihu crisscross, with dense irrigation canals, a mild climate, and fertile soil, which is known as the "land of fish and rice." In terms of the national government's material supply, it accounts for a very large proportion. Increasing agricultural production in the Jiangnan area has also been listed as one of the key points of the Jiangsu provincial government's administration in the future. Therefore, the issue of increasing food production in Jiangsu Province must be urgently reviewed. However, although there are many current production increase plans, such as dredging transportation, abolishing taxes, implementing rationing, and cracking down on hoarding, all of these passive palliative methods are unlikely to be truly effective and lasting. Therefore, I have ventured to write this article, hoping that scholars at home will not hesitate to enlighten me.</p>
<p>Status of Food Production in Jiangsu Province</p>
<p>Past and Present</p>
<p>According to statistics, Jiangsu Province had 33.6 million mu of paddy fields before the Incident, with an annual rice production of about 82.5 million shi, an average of 2.45 shi of rice per mu. After the Incident, although the Construction Department strictly ordered each county to report the cultivated area and yield of important crops every year, the technical personnel in each county were lacking and the economy was not sufficient, so the figures obtained could not be fully utilized. How is the food production situation in the counties of Jiangnan? There is no way to do anything other than roughly estimate it. Although Jiangnan and Jiangbei in Jiangsu Province are separated by only one river, the natural environment, soil quality, water conservancy, farming situation, and rural economy are very different. In terms of the actual situation of agriculture, the paddy field area in the 21 counties of Jiangnan accounts for at least one-half of the total paddy field area of the province, that is, more than 15 million mu. Now, the following methods are used to make a rough estimate of rice production in the counties of Jiangnan.</p>
<p>According to the number of tax-assessed fields in each county in the statistics of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance in 1943, it is used as the total arable land area of each county. Although the numbers in this statistic contain some non-productive land areas such as residential land, wasteland, and tombs, each county generally reports more than the actual number of tax-assessed fields due to psychological factors, so the accuracy of the statistics is still close to the facts.</p>
<p>Hunan Province is the richest rice-producing area in China, and the counties of Jiangnan in Jiangsu can also be compared with it, and some counties even exceed it. According to the estimate of Mr. Zhang Xinyi of the Statistics Office of the Legislative Yuan, the paddy field area in Hunan Province accounts for about 66% of the total arable land area, so it is assumed that the average percentage of paddy field area in the counties of Jiangnan is 70%.</p>
<p>According to 1. The Shanghai Bank Commodity Investigation Bulletin No. 1 "Rice" estimates that the average rice production per mu in Jiangsu Province is 2.07 shi. 2. The above-mentioned average rice production per mu is 2.45 shi. It is assumed that the average rice production per mu is 2.25 shi.</p>
<p>The table shows the rice production of 21 counties in Jiangnan, Jiangsu Province.</p>
<p>Wu County, Yixing, Taicang. Liyang, Jinshan, Wuxi, Changshu, Gaochun, Jiangyin, Jiangning, Yangzhou, Wujiang, Wutong, Jurong, Kunshan, Songjiang, Zhenjiang, Qingpu, Danyang, Jinshan, Shenshui has 15.3 million mu of paddy fields with an annual rice production of 34.4 million shi. After the Incident, due to the impact of the war on rural areas and the disturbance of bandits, the agricultural production capacity of Jiangsu Province declined sharply. Item name 1936 yield (thousand dan) Rice 1,023.202 Wheat 463.353 Millet 135.487 Sorghum 153.809 Check before 1936, the war only affected the Beijing-Shanghai area of North China and Central China, and the counties of Jiangnan were the main rice-producing area in this area, and the rate of decline in rice production accounted for the first place among all food, which shows the severity of the war's impact on rural areas in Jiangnan. If the estimated rice production in the counties of Jiangnan is converted according to the rate of decline in production, then the actual rice production in Jiangnan is only 27.9 million shi. Assuming that men eat 8 he of rice per day and women eat 6 he of rice per day, the average is reduced to 7 he per person per day, and we cannot obtain the rate of this number. However, in 1939, the Agricultural Bank of China made a comparison of the harvest of various important food crops in 1936 (pre-war) and 1938 (post-war), as shown in the following table: 1938 yield (thousand dan) percentage 82.232 81% 206.483 45% 59.101 58% 26.441 20% 36.170 23% calculated, then each person needs to eat about 2.5 shi of rice per year, and 27.9 million shi of rice can supply the food for more than 11 million people for one year. According to the situation that people are massively concentrated in the Jiangnan area after the war, the population of the 21 counties of Jiangnan is definitely not this number. Although not all people rely on rice as their main food, the insufficient distribution of rice is undoubtedly indisputable. Therefore, the urgent need to restore the productivity of rural areas in Jiangnan should be regarded as a major undertaking of the Jiangsu provincial government in the future, and it is urgent and cannot be delayed.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Rapidly Resolve the Food Crisis</h3>
<p>Recently, due to the uncontrolled soaring of rice prices, general commodity prices have also followed suit, spreading like wildfire and without end. The general public, especially salaried workers and common citizens, are feeling the heavy pressure of life and experiencing great panic. We believe that under such a severe situation, emergency countermeasures must be decided and implemented quickly. The content of the emergency countermeasures must be practical, easy to implement, and have quick results.</p>
<p>Under the current severe circumstances, it is undeniable that we must gather all our strength and contribute to the single goal of winning victory, from any point of view. The current rice and food crisis, and even the price crisis, are sufficient to threaten people's livelihood and affect the gathering of all our strength. Therefore, we absolutely cannot allow this problem to run its course or continue to delay, and we should quickly develop rescue measures that address the crux of the problem.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we hope that the people will not panic excessively about the soaring rice prices, because this soaring of rice prices is ultimately unreasonable. As long as we quickly develop emergency countermeasures and address the root cause, we can at least curb the unreasonable soaring. At the same time, in a passive way, everyone should immediately change the notion that they cannot survive without rice, and adopt miscellaneous grains for subsistence in order to reduce the degree of panic over rice and food.</p>
<p>Most miscellaneous grains are not subject to control, and procurement and transportation are free. Also, the amount of miscellaneous grains that have already been transported to Shanghai from various places is not small. From an objective standpoint, miscellaneous grain prices do not have a consistent linkage effect with rice prices. However, the current miscellaneous grain prices have soared in proportion to rice prices. Our research shows that the crux of this lies in letting it go unchecked. Therefore, the simultaneous soaring of miscellaneous grain prices is a phenomenon of anarchy. We hope that the authorities will quickly suppress miscellaneous grain prices and procure a steady supply from production areas such as Huaihai as soon as possible.</p>
<p>In addition, we have always believed that the rice and grain purchasing method needs to be changed. If we do not make fundamental and reasonable reforms, the food problem will only become more complicated and difficult to improve. It is an inevitable and unquestionable principle to adopt a controlled economy in wartime. The improvement we advocate is not a change in the principle of the controlled policy, but a transformation of the control technology. Because the purchasing method has not been fully adapted to the national and public sentiment, it has increased the severity of the rice and grain problem. Feeling the lessons of this repeated experience, we further advocate that we must quickly improve the control technology. Once the control technology is improved, the people will naturally place new expectations on the resolution of the food problem, thereby alleviating the sense of panic.</p>
<p>Speaking of improving control technology, we naturally hope that the national government will take responsibility and consider the entire plan. At the same time, we hope that the allied authorities will do their utmost to assist in promoting the realization of the plan. Only when the Chinese and Japanese authorities embrace the heart of considering others hunger as their own hunger, and regarding the drowning of others as their own drowning, can they work together to implement the plan and achieve effective improvements.</p>
<p>We have said before: "As long as the strength of the Chinese authorities, the strength of the Allied authorities stationed in China, and the strength of popular leadership are united, then all difficulties can be overcome." Today, to quickly suppress rice prices and regulate food, we can only hope that these three forces are united and do their utmost.</p>

<h3>Chongqing's Poor New Recruits</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 13th (Central News Agency) – According to Chongqing telegrams: Lu Zhonglin, Minister of the Military Service Department of Chongqing, recently flew to Yunnan, Sichuan, Hunan, and other places to inspect the actual situation of military service. He has now returned to Chongqing on the 9th. Lu expressed dissatisfaction with the recruitment of new recruits in various places. After arriving in Chongqing, he made the following statement to reporters: The recruitment of soldiers in Yunnan Province is better, but many of the new recruits are unqualified in physique. Some of the elderly, weak, and unqualified new recruits have been ordered to be given expenses and sent back to their hometowns, and the commanders of each district have been strictly ordered to impose strict warnings if the same situation occurs again in the future. The recruitment of soldiers in western Hunan has been poor due to the impact of the war, and a total of eight county magistrates have failed to handle the recruitment of soldiers in accordance with the law. The provincial government of Hunan is requested to give them appropriate punishment by telegram. Zeng Ding, the regiment leader of the Yuanshui Military Service District, fraudulently reported the number of personnel and falsely received military pay and has been dismissed from his post and punished according to law. In short, the physical fitness of the people has declined recently, and the heads of each unit are thinking about extracting money from the new recruits, which makes the soldiers even worse. In addition, the recruitment of the district and county heads only focuses on the quantity of recruits and does not pay attention to the quality of the new recruits. Each commander has been strictly ordered that there must be no more unqualified new recruits in the future, otherwise all expenses shall be the responsibility of the commander of each military service district.</p>

According to the most reliable estimates, the number of personnel lost in the European theater reached 9 to 10 million. In addition, about 9 to 10 million were disabled by war wounds, and millions more suffered minor injuries. There were approximately 12 million prisoners of war. The losses on both sides were roughly the same, around 15 million, with more than two-thirds of the losses belonging to the Soviet Union. American losses in Europe were estimated at 700,000, including 145,000 killed in action. The number of civilian deaths and injuries was in the millions. Furthermore, a substantial number of individuals are unable to lead normal lives due to physical and mental exhaustion. Accurate statistics on civilian deaths and injuries are still lacking, but a portion of them were killed by enemy bombing and attacks from V-1 and V-2 rockets, with 145,000 American civilians killed.</p>

<h3>Pétain Under Preliminary Hearing in a Military Camp in Mons</h3>
<p>Zurich, 13th (Central News Agency) - Marshal Pétain, former head of the Vichy government, remains imprisoned in the Yersen military camp on the outskirts of Paris. During the preliminary hearing at the military camp, Marshal Pétain stated that the policy of the Vichy government was one of "dual personality," and was actually intended to launch a resistance movement against Germany within France. The main points of his statement are as follows: My policy towards Germany was one of false pretense, and I collaborated with outstanding Allied generals such as Darlan and Weygand. I was also a member of the anti-German faction, but only conducted anti-German resistance within France. Furthermore, I opposed de Gaulle's individual, meaningless sacrifices within the country. I was deeply saddened by the German execution of hostages and even requested to be a hostage myself. I firmly believe that I have made great contributions to France. My appointment of Laval as head of the government was to conceal the truth from Germany, and as a result, the German side was also satisfied.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from British newspapers in Barcelona, former head of the Vichy government, Laval, is currently imprisoned on the old Lerich Mountain, closely monitoring the trial of Marshal Pétain, and can only wait to see what Pétain's fate will be before deciding his own course of action.</p>

<h3>Impressions of Eastern Zhejiang (III)</h3>
<p>— Yifei</p>
<p>By the Cao'e River</p>
<p>Due to difficulties with transportation, I stayed in Shaoxing for five days and only left on May 19th for Ningbo. At 7:00 AM that morning, amidst the misty rain, I headed to the bus station to wait for a ticket. The bus was scheduled to depart at 9:30 AM, but because it took time to heat the charcoal and there were concerns about breakdowns en route, the bus was tested again and again before departure. It finally departed at 10:15 AM in pouring rain. The road was extremely bumpy, and the bus body swayed significantly, especially when crossing bridges, due to the heavy rain. The entire route was dominated by continuous mountains. Thirty li away from Cao'e River is "Changliu Village," where the "Changshan" mountain has red soil, contrasting with the forests on the mountain, creating an interesting and characteristic landscape.</p>
<p>At 12:45 PM, the bus arrived at the Cao'e River. After getting off the bus, I took a small boat operated by the Baiguan Ferry Bureau to cross the river. The river was about 30 to 40 zhang wide. There were three huge bridge piers in the river, standing proudly. According to the boatmen, these bridge piers were intended to support a railway bridge before the war, allowing direct access for Shanghai-Hangzhou railway passenger cars to Ningbo. However, the bridge piers were only just laid before the war broke out, and the project was suspended.</p>
<p>After about five minutes, I arrived on the opposite bank. The muddy shore was about a zhang away from the water's edge. The reporter was carried ashore on someone's back and climbed to the Baiguan Inspection Post. After undergoing a routine inspection, I arrived at the parking lot, which was a square carved out of a mountain. There were barracks on the mountaintop, which was about 30 zhang high, forming a strategically important location.</p>
<p>閒詁百官 (A Leisurely Chat About Baiguan)</p>
<p>It is said that Baiguan is a town in Shangyu County, Zhejiang Province, with a population of about 20,000. Most residents make a living by farming and fishing. During non-farming seasons, rural women also engage in temporary side occupations such as weaving straw sandals and hats. Tangpu and Zhangjiapu, 60 li away from Baiguan, and "Shangpu," 30 li away, produce silk and tea. Farmers often transport these local products to distant places to sell for profit during their free time.</p>
<p>Recently, due to unrest in the surrounding villages, Shangyu County and other affiliated organizations have relocated here, resulting in a sudden influx of military doctors and government officials. The only street in the area is narrow and desolate, with a completely rural atmosphere. The main produce is wheat, soybeans, and corn. Prices are cheaper than in Shaoxing. When the reporter arrived, the prices were as follows: rice was 140,000 yuan per dan (second-grade rice was 135,000 yuan), pork was 1,760 yuan per jin, chicken was 1,600 yuan per jin, cooking oil was 2,400 yuan per jin, soft firewood was 12 yuan per jin, and hardwood was 15 yuan.</p>
<p>民生一斑 (Glimpse of People's Livelihoods)</p>
<p>The reporter went to the parking lot early the next morning to inquire about bus information. I witnessed many farmers and children carrying rice bags, crowding near the inspection post, looking anxious and hoping to cross the river. Curious, I asked them and learned that they were residents from the Cao'e Temple area across the river. Because rice is not produced locally, its price (160,000 yuan) is more expensive than in Baiguan. They came to the town to buy rice to cook, but were blocked at the inspection post and not allowed to pass. Then, the reporter asked about their daily lives. According to them, the harvest in the villages around Cao'e has been poor in recent years, so in addition to managing household affairs, they must also work hard to help their families cultivate the fields, hoping to increase crop yields. Because the early wheat (i.e., barley) has not yet been harvested, they are experiencing a difficult period. Most of them only have one proper meal a day, and the rest of the time they subsist on barley gruel. Their difficult lives are evident.</p>

<h3>News Association Holds Tea Party Yesterday to Welcome Minister Kuwabara, Encouraging Mutual Unity to Overcome Difficulties</h3>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the China News Association, to welcome the newly appointed Minister Kuwabara of the Japanese Fleet Press Department in China, specially held a tea party yesterday (the 13th) afternoon at the Hua Mou Hotel. Minister Kuwabara arrived on time with Captain Matsumoto and others, and were received by Chen Binhe, Chairman of the Shanghai branch of the China News Association, and others. More than a hundred people from various newspapers attended, including Tozaka Yuichi, Moriyama Takashi, Chen Riping, Xu Liqun, Jin Xiongbo, Lu Guangjie, Ni Diesun, Weng Yongqing, Lu Feng, Yang Huilang, and Zheng Jie. Chen Binhe first delivered a welcoming speech, followed by Minister Kuwabara's reply, where he expressed his aspirations. The host and guests were enthusiastic, and the party ended around 4:00 PM. Today, the Shanghai branch of the China News Association held a tea party to welcome Minister Kuwabara of the Fleet Press Department. We are very pleased by your presence. Minister Kuwabara has served in China for many years and is familiar with the situation in China, with many Chinese friends. In the past, he worked hard to promote Sino-Japanese cooperation. We have known Minister Kuwabara for a long time, and our friendship has always been profound. We are especially pleased that the relationship with the press community will become even closer in the future. Currently, the situation is becoming increasingly tense, and the responsibility of the press community is also becoming increasingly important. However, I firmly believe that if the governments of China and Japan, together with the people of both countries, unite as one, then all difficulties can be overcome.</p>
<p>In terms of objectives and direction of propaganda and reporting work, the first requirement is unification. Only with firm belief and consistent steps can strength be generated. Currently, the spirit of unity among our Shanghai press colleagues is unprecedented since before the incident, and the attitude of cooperation is also unprecedented. Secondly, the cooperation between the press community and reporting agencies is also extremely close, and these are all excellent phenomena. Now, we are even more fortunate to have Mr. Kuwabara, an old friend who is familiar with the situation in China, to take up the post of Minister of the Fleet Press Department, providing us with guidance and assistance. We firmly believe that in the future, our propaganda work will be more consistent and more closely collaborative.</p>
<p>Minister Kuwabara's reply Minister Kuwabara, Minister of the Fleet Press Department, delivered his reply, stating briefly: Mr. Matsushima has been honorably transferred, and I am temporarily taking over his duties. I am deeply grateful to the News Association for holding this tea party today and for Chairman Chen's many compliments. As Chairman Chen said, I have served in China for a relatively long time, but even though the time is long, I cannot claim to be completely familiar and clear about everything in China. During my time in China, I have made many Chinese friends, and we often express the phrase "Sino-Japanese Friendship" in our conversations. I have made great efforts regarding the issue of Sino-Japanese friendship, but the development of this issue has been the opposite of what was expected. There are certainly various reasons for this, but one of the reasons is that Chinese and Japanese people have not fully understood their counterparts. In order for the two countries to thoroughly understand each other, the intellectual community must rise up to guide and struggle. All of you present today are authorities in the intellectual community. It is my sincere hope that through your efforts, the Chinese and Japanese nations can thoroughly recognize and understand each other. Since I am now also in charge of reporting duties, my personal aspirations are also based on this goal, and I will strive to achieve it. I hope that you will not hesitate to teach me. The current situation has reached a critical stage, and I hope that we can unite as one to achieve this goal.</p>

<h3>Economic Police Authorities Strictly Investigate Hoarding, Yong'an Company Confiscated Soap and Cloth</h3>
<p>Recently, the city's prices have risen dramatically, and public security and people's livelihood have been greatly threatened. The economic authorities have repeatedly discussed appropriate measures with various relevant authorities to crack down on the situation. At the same time, the city police economic authorities are still strictly investigating a large number of unscrupulous merchants and stores hoarding and exceeding price limits. It is reported that the Economic Police Brigade, based on a tip-off, discovered that Yong'an Company on Nanjing Road disregarded the law and hoarded a large number of daily necessities such as soap and various cloths, which was illegal. Therefore, the police were dispatched to the company a few days ago, and more than 1,000 boxes of soap and more than 40 bundles of cloth (40 pieces per bundle) were seized in the false walls on the second and third floors. The hoarding was investigated on the spot. The company's secret hiding place for soap and cloth was obviously unwilling to sell the products to the public and attempted to hoard for profit. The economic regulations will be confiscated and punished, and this kind of illegal act should be severely punished as a warning to others.</p>
<p>Confiscated edible oil sold at parity prices. In addition: the economic police brigade of the Fourth Division of the Municipal Police Bureau recently discovered that an oil merchant hoarded more than 50 dan of edible oil and refused to sell it to the public. The oil merchant was summoned to the bureau for questioning. In order to maintain the people's livelihood, they were ordered to hand over the goods and were sold at a reasonable price of 4,000 yuan per catty. It has been distributed at the same time by five teams from the afternoon of yesterday. Each city catty is priced at 4,000 yuan, and each person is limited to buy half a catty for universality. It is reported that if merchants are found hoarding in the future, the same measures will be taken to limit them to public sales.</p>
<h3>Two Cases of Official Misconduct: Verdicts Announced Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Wheat from the Huaihai Province: To be Shipped to Shanghai</h3>

<h3>Shanghai Military License Plates Limited to Military Personnel</h3>
<p>The white egg-shaped military vehicle license plates in Shanghai were originally special vehicle license plates for use by the defense forces of the city. From November of the 31st year to May of this year, the former Public Works Bureau and the Construction Bureau successively issued a considerable number of Shanghai military license plates. However, it has recently been found that vehicles with Shanghai military license plates are sometimes occupied by women, parked in entertainment venues, or not inspected by the police, and some are even transporting contraband. In order to prevent malpractices, the municipal authorities have stipulated that only military personnel and their families who are wearing uniforms may ride in vehicles with Shanghai military license plates. In addition to requesting the transportation section of the city to contact the relevant military agencies and units of the Allied nations, notices have been sent to the military agencies to pay close attention and conduct inspections at any time to prevent abuse.</p>

As an impromptu motion, Director Liu proposed a consumer savings campaign, which was unanimously approved. A plan is being drafted and consulted with relevant bureaus and departments for implementation. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 noon.</p>
<p>Clarification on the Fee for Ration Coupons by the Economic Bureau: In response to the news in the newspapers on the 10th of this month that "each ration coupon costs 100 yuan," the Municipal Economic Bureau clarified that citizens are not charged for obtaining ration coupons. The ration items claiming certificate (i.e., household registration card) was originally used in areas without house tax tickets, that is, to replace house tax tickets, and is only for the 17th, 18th, 19th, 20th, 21st, 22nd, 23rd, and 24th issuing offices and shantytowns. Each certificate costs 100 yuan for paper and printing costs. If you belong to the 1st to 16th issuing offices, you can apply with the spring house tax ticket of the 34th year, and you don't need to buy a separate ration items claiming certificate (i.e., household registration card). Because shantytowns do not have house tax tickets, they should use the ration items claiming certificate to obtain a comprehensive ration certificate. It is also learned that from the first of each day, each copy will also be charged 100 yuan uniformly. Those who are late in claiming will be fined 20 yuan per certificate. No other fees will be charged. Citizens are advised to pay attention.</p>
