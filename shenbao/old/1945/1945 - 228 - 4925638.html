<h3>非常措置收拾時局　日皇頒和平詔書　命政府接受中美蘇共同宣言</h3>
<p>東京十五日中央社電　日皇十五日正午廣播，並爲使全國人民普通能收聽起見，凡白書無電流之地方，特別臨時供給電流，此次廣播並非僅對日本國內，且對大東亞各地亦同時轉播。又悉，日皇廣播後，繼之有鈴木首相廣播以及日政府關於大東亞戰爭現階段有極重要發表。同時全日本各報紙一律延遲時間出版，俾便於日皇廣播後，立即刋載是項新聞，傳達各　者。</p>
<p>東京十五日中央社電　日皇爲萬　　求和平，十四日賜命政府，對中·美·英·蘇四國通知接受波次坦宣言。同時，頒陽大詔，宣示接受四國共同宣言之不得已，並於十五日正午躬親廣播大詔。</p>
<h3>詔書</h3>
<p>朕鑒於世界情勢與帝國之現狀，欲以非常措置收拾時局，茲吿爾等忠良臣民曰：</p>
<p>朕命帝國政府通知中·美·英·蘇四國，接受其共同宣言。</p>
<p>夫謀帝國臣民之康寧，偕萬邦共榮之樂，此爲皇和皇宗之遺範，爲朕之拳拳無措者。曩者，向美·英兩國宣戰，亦爲期望帝國之自存與東亞之安定，排斥他國主權，侵佔領土，固非朕之志也。然交戰已歷四載，朕之陸。海將士勇戰，朕之百僚有司精勵，朕之一億衆庶奉公，各盡最善，惟戰局未必好轉，世界之大勢亦不利於我，加之敵使用殘虐炸彈，頻頻殺傷無辜，慘害所及，誠不可測，且若繼續交戰，不但我民族終吿減亡，且人類文明亦必被毀，如斯朕何以保億兆赤子，謝皇　皇家之神靈，是故朕命帝國政府接受共同宣言。</p>
<p>朕對始終協力日本帝國解放東亞之諸盟邦，不得不表遺憾之意及帝國臣民死於戰陣，殉於職守，斃於非命者及其遺族，五內俱裂，至於受戰傷，蒙災禍，失家業者之厚生，朕深爲軫念。</p>
<p>惟今後帝國將受之苦難，固異於尋常，爾等臣民之衷情，朕亦深知，然朕以時運所趨，忍受難以忍受者，爲萬世　求和平。</p>
<p>朕於茲能維護國體，信倚爾等臣民赤忱，與爾等臣民共在，若夫激乎情感，濫滋事端，或排擠同胞，混亂時局，致誤大道，失信義於世界，爲朕所最深戒者。期望舉國一家，子孫相傳，確信神州不滅，念任重道遠，集總力於將來之建設，篤信道義，固守志操，誓以發揚國體之精神，不後於世界之進運，望爾等臣民各體朕意。</p>
<h3>波次坦宣言　日接受過</h3>
<p>東京十五日中央社電　據此間外交界息，日政府接受四國共同宣言之前，曾作外交上之折衝，即當戰局不利日本，世界大勢對日更不利後，日本早已盡最大之努力，以圖維護國體，民國三十二年十一月二十七日，中·美·英三國開會於開羅，發表開羅宣言，使日本國內騷然，然冷靜觀察戰局之日外交當局，即已考慮和平。至本年五月，德國崩潰，此見解更趨有力，日本政府乃藉保有中立關係之蘇聯爲介，努力與英·美言和，然至本年七月二十六日，三國發表波次坦共同宣言，並說明此爲對日最後通牒，日政府當時採取不理態度，豈知日本不理之外交上意義，竟成爲蘇聯宣戰之理由。蘇聯之宣戰布吿，透露日本謀挽蘇聯努力和平之事實，因蘇聯之宣戰，日本之外交努力悉成泡影。尤有進者，原子炸彈之出現，早已使戰爭不能繼續維持，八月九日，日政府即發出接受波次坦宣言之通吿，此通吿基於無損最高統洽者大權之諒解，四國於十三日將覆文送至東京，由此，日本政府知維　團體已獲保障，乃向中·英·美·蘇四國投降。</p>
<p>中央社訊　據同盟社東京十五日電，日政府關於此番按受波次坦宣言，自九日至十四日間，曾舉行量高戰爭指導會議臨時閣議　次，即九日於宮中舉行最高戰爭指導會議，下午二時半至五時半，下午六時半至十時十分，於首相官邸舉行臨時閣議，聽取首相等意見，下午十一時五十五分至次晨三時，於宮中舉行御前會議，決定接受波次坦宣言，續於上午三時十分至四時，在首相官邸開臨時閣議，檢討發表力法。十一日上午七時，請瑞士政府通知接受之意。十二日下午二時五分至二時四十四分，鈴木首相晉宮報吿，下午三時至五時半開閣義，交換意見，同時宮中自下午三時至五時舉行皇族會議。十三日上午八時，接到聯合國正式回答，上午八時五十分至九時十分開最高戰爭指導會議，參加者爲首相。陸。海·外三相及參謀總長，軍令部總長六人，十時半起至三時再開，討論維護國體問題，四時至七時半開閣義，意見未能一致。十四日，鈴木首相晋宮二次，舉行御前會議，上午十時宮中舉行元帥會議，上午十時四十五分至正午，於宮中破例開御前會議，退宮連開閣議三次，至下午八時半，首相再行晋宮，完竣一切手續，決發詔書。</p>
<h3>上海日本陸海軍　最高指揮官布吿　妨碍治安依軍律處置</h3>
<p>中央社滬訊　現地日陸海軍最高指揮官，十五日頒發布吿如下：</p>
<p>際此新情勢，日本軍爲維持增進中國民衆之福祉，認爲確保治安，乃最緊要之措置。是故，現地日本軍遵奉上司命令，暫時繼續執行確保治安之任務，切望中國民衆信賴日本軍，不受流　蜚語之蠱惑，始終保持冷靜態　，協力日軍維持治安。</p>
<p>如有妨碍我方治安警備者，則本軍視爲民衆之敵，決依照軍律，予以最重處置」。</p>
<h3>日鈴木首相向國民廣播</h3>
<p>東京十五日中央社電　鈴木首相十五日下午七時向日本國民廣播，略謂，大詔旣下，國民今後之方向已定，多難之前途，惟有賴國民努力開拓其命運。國民今後應一心維護國體，內爭輕舉，尤當切戒，今後常盡最大力量，救援戰災者之遺族及傷兵。</p>
<p>東京十五日中央社電　日皇於十四日決定結東大東亞戰爭，鈴木首相特頒發內閣吿諭如次：</p>
<p>本日拜受大詔，帝國從事大東亞戰爭，已近四載，茲聖慮採取非常措置，以結束戰局，爲臣子者，恐懼不可言狀。顧開戰以還，曝屍骨於異域之將士，不知其數，本土之被害，無辜之犧牲，就已至極，事已至此痛心無已，然戰事之目的無可實現，戰勢又未必有利，至今已被使用科學史上未曾有破壞力之新型炸彈，使戰爭局勢一變，繼蘇聯於九日對帝國宣戰，帝國誠遭逢未曾有之困難。茲聖上盧及聖德廣大無邊之世界和平與臣民之康寧，頒賜大詔，聖斷旣下，赤子所應循方途已明，帝國之前途，因此更加困難，國民應忍受困苦，然帝國應由於此種忍苦之結實，開拓國家將來命運，本大臣於茲吞萬斛之淚，向同胞求誓，今日國民之應爲者，唯在維護國體，切勿拘泥旣往，同胞相猜內爭，爲他所乘，或激於情感，輕舉妄動，失信義於世界。又對於戰死者，戰災者之遺族及傷痍軍人之援護，固應悉力以赴，政府期與國民必謹詔書，刻苦奮勵，奉體聖心，必恢復國威，以應父祖遺澤。又此際更應一言者，即爲處此難局之官更任務，聖上至尊宣示「爾等臣民之衷情朕亦深知」，望官吏宜奉行此仁慈之聖旨，成爲喚起復興精神之先驅。</p>
<h3>日設戰後　對策委會</h3>
<p>中央社訊　據同盟社東京十五日電　日政府決定設立戰後對策委員會，其任務爲推進戰後復興，增產食糧，確保輸送力，抑止通貨膨脹等工作。</p>
<h3>蘇聯日僑　准自由行動</h3>
<p>瑞典京城十三日中央社電　據莫斯科來電，莫斯科日本大使館員及新聞通信社特派員，現留居於佐藤大使宿舍或大使官邸，均准許自由行動，不受任何拘束，例如購買食糧品，電話連絡等均照舊，惟無綫電收音機及武器被扣留，全體甚爲安全。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>鎭靜沉着</h3>
<p>日昨本報就一般市民應付環境之法，加以論列，力主以鎭靜沉着爲第一要着。這就是所謂「以不變應萬變」。當然，這種應付時局轉變的方法，無論爲逆轉或順轉，都是不可忽略的。尤其是由逆境而轉入順境的時候，容易激起人心驕傲與浮動，而驕傲與浮動的結果，往往足以僨事。况且，地方的社會的國家的事情，比較個人的事情爲重大，所以在局勢轉變之際，切忌輕率浮躁，但求人人皆知鎭靜，人人皆守秩序，各守崗位，各盡本職，在鎭靜盡職中穩波時局的轉變，於私於公兩有利益。這樣才可算爲新時代的國民，才能立足於未來的新社會。</p>
<p>誠然，目前時局正在轉變時期，情緒興奮固是人情之常，可是，我們要有理智的興奮，而不能有情感的興奮。情感的興奮是浮動，只有誤事而不能成事。理智的興奮是鎭靜，內心雖然興奮，而外表務必鎭靜，理智約束情感，才能負重致遠。</p>
<p>其次，在時局波動之際，因爲利害的刺激，心理上容易發生不安狀態，由於不安而起恐慌，更由恐慌而起浮動。前者是情緒的浮動，表現於輕率行爲；後者是心理的浮動，表現於經濟方面。現在時局已經到達轉捩點了，更不容揣測流傳，同時，需要我們每個人民各守本位而努力的地方正多，我們决不能再出之浮動行爲，必須鎭靜沉着，共同穩渡。就本市而言，我們可以鄭重奉吿市民者，第一，大家所關心的中儲券的價値問題，有關當局旣已商有穩定辦法，昨天中儲當局又發表發行總額及準備金數量，是則中儲券之價値，已可確定計算，决不如一般人心理之恐慌。第二，地方治安問題，中日雙方在此時局下，也已經直接間接地商討具體有效的維持辦法，只要全體市民都能以愛國家愛地方之心，鎭靜協力，勿使不良份子乘機騷動，則絕對可以不發生問題。</p>
<p>這兩個最迫切的問題，已有相當可恃的解决辦法，我們每一個市民，都可以袪除心頭無謂的暗雲，放棄不必要的疑慮，安分守己，做一個好市民應做的事情。同時，國家社會，在目前特別希望每一個國民也都能如此。</p>
<p>除了消極的不作危害治安與民生的言行之外，一個眞正的愛國者，尙須積極的協助維持秩序，保障民生。在協助維持治安方面，我們認爲首光得由加强保甲自警團的工作開始，俾以民衆自己的力量來警備及保護地方治安。在協助保障民生方面，一般市民應不急於以鈔易貨，以致人人效尤而造成物價高騰的險象；商界市民，尤當共體時艱，決不利用任何時機，閉市或抬價，以發揮商人之道德心。若入人但知如何設法轉嫁損害於他人身上，其心跡已不堪問，那裏還談得到愛國呢？</p>
<p>爲求達到「鎭靜第一」，以期地方安寗，地方當局和全體市民，必須共同協力，維持治安，保障民生。更當以國家民族爲至上，在這時局轉捩關頭，爲辱爲榮，全在我們鎭靜沉着，認淸現實，善於抉擇。</p>
<h3>對在華日僑　谷大使廣播　盼冷靜沉着隱忍自重</h3>
<p>中央社南京十五日電　日谷大使十五日下午七時起，對在華日僑廣播，原文如下：「本日正午，天皇陛下親自廣播，向一萬萬同胞頒賜大詔，誠覺惶恐，際此前所未有之國難，我人拜聽玉音，悲慟之餘，不覺精神百倍，此番帝國政府爲挽救民族之滅亡及文明之破壞，接受波次坦宣言，經此接受，有二千六百年光榮歷史之日本，今後自將步入前所未有之荆棘之途，從來想像不到之苦艱及試練，已加於我人雙肩之上，大和民族出生人死，維護國體，作最大之忍耐，以圖皇國萬世之安泰，而發揮民族之精神，此正其時矣。夫歷史者悠久之歷史也，於悠久之歷史中，我人如能抱此精神，堅持光榮之民族矜持及傳統，傾注全力邁進，確信必有前途，置身異地之同胞，今後所遭遇之國難，將較本國同胞所遭遇者更大，自應以更大之勇敢心，克服國自當盡最大努力，以謀保護僑民生命財產之萬全措置。盼各位以冷靜之態度，發揮日本精神，各致奉公之誠，尤須切戒萬一爲情感所驅使而輕舉妄動，自貽伊戚。申言之，對華新政策之精神，仍當堅持不變，以不變應付變化，各守職務，是所最要。倘若被情感所騙，破壞生產設備，不但有背聖諭，抑且累及國家之將來。要而言之，今後我人應銘記聖詔之一字一句，一律日常之行動，誠如聖詔所示，神州必不滅，道義必再見。余深盼在華僑胞，冷靜沉着，隱忍自重，奉體聖慮，採取無恥於中外之態度」。</p>
<h3>被拘美僑　將獲釋放</h3>

<h3>美陸海空軍　昨奉令停戰　麥克沃塞任聯軍統帥</h3>
<p>中央社訊　據華盛頓十五日電：美陸軍宣布：所有陸空軍對日作戰行爲，業於今日奉令停止，陸軍發言人於答覆詢問時稱，所有空戰已下令停止時情形下令停炸。</p>
<p>中央社訊　據重慶十五日電，美新聞處關島電：尼米資將軍所屬太平洋艦隊及其他部隊，已奉命停止對日攻擊。尼米資總部結束太平洋作戰行動之公報稱，太平洋艦隊司令所屬太平洋各艦隊及太平洋區其他艦隊，已奉命停止對日進攻。</p>

<h3>提倡食用豆類（一）</h3>
<p>— 上海聖約翰大學農學院</p>
<p>米麥缺乏之時，最佳之副糧爲大豆與蠶豆。大豆古稱戎菽，因其豆之顏色，有靑黃黑白之不同，俗有黃豆·靑豆·黑豆·之名稱，大豆已爲學名，自較單以色別爲名者合理。</p>
<p>大豆原產於我國，已有五千餘年之栽培歷史，自一八七三年吾國參加奥國維也納萬國博覽會之後，中國大豆遂著稱於全世界。蠶豆釋名爲胡豆，爲豆科作物栽培之最古者，原產於亞洲東南部，因其蠶時始熟，故得其名，亦有謂其莢之狀態如蠶，而得名者。</p>
<p>中國向以大豆與蠶豆爲米糧缺乏時之防荒作物，在古農籍中屢見之，氾勝之書曰：「大豆保歲爲宜古之所以備兇年也。」王楨農書：「大豆食而充飢，可備兇年。」本草輕；「張騫使外國得胡豆種歸，蜀人收其子，以備荒歉」。後漢書馮異傳有「光武謂諸將曰：昨得公孫豆粥，飢寒俱解。」在王楨農書中，有「蠶豆百榖之中最先，登·蒸·煮皆可，便食是用，接新代飯充飽。」玄滬先生曰：「蠶豆極救農家之急，且蝗所不食。」此種豆類因用途廣大，現今歐美各國，種植者頗多。</p>
<p>營養價値</p>
<p>大豆，蠶豆，豌豆，花生等，在植物學上，均屬於豆科作物，其所有之營養價値，亦大致相似·所含之蛋白質成分，極爲豐富。大豆所含者有百分之三四，脂肪甚多，約占百分之一七强。同時炭水化合物（即糖分澱粉質及纖維）亦多，因依據營養價値之計算，脂肪在消化時，每磅等於二倍四分之一之炭水化合物，大豆在完全成熟後，所含之澱粉質，幾等於零。在豆之灰分中，鐵與鉀之成份特多，即磷酸鉀一物約佔有百分之八〇。在普通食糧之中，澱粉質及其他炭水化合物，大多均皆豐富，能供給人體中充量之炭素，然營養中最重要之氮紫成分，均皆欠缺。惟有在豆科作物中，含量特多。故欲補足此類至要之營養成份，非多食豆類不可也。在豆類中之　素成分，均爲植物性酪質（Pant　Casein）狀態，與牛乳中之酪質類似。根據化學分析而言，豆類作物除含有適數之澱粉質外，且有極豐富之蛋白質及脂肪成分，不下於優美之牛肉。如在營養之熱量作斤與斤之比較，則大豆與蠶豆較肉類與榖類爲多矣。在六十餘年前，莫萊斯旭特（Moleschott）氏曾謂：「豌豆勝牛肉，大豆勝鴿肉，任何種肉類，均望塵莫及。」故豆類食品較肉類爲優美。又據伏特（Voit）氏之硏究，謂豆類食品中之滋養成分，大多在細胞中，被粗糲之織維質所包含，故食後一時不易完全消化，而被胃腸所吸收，故有耐飢之功。又據名醫茄倫（Galen）氏之證明，「荳類食品非如其他食品之易於消化，且食之易致惡夢。」故此類食品極適合於勞力者所食用，如學生，兵士，勞工以及室外之工作者，因耐飢而又當滋養也。霍夫門氏曾將荳類食品與肉類食品在人體中作消化之試騐，其結果謂在同一消化之時間內，荳類中之蛋白質成分消化率爲百分之五三，而肉類中之消化率爲百分之八二·三，故荳類中之蛋白質成分，其消化時間，是較肉類中者爲遲緩。又據華洛斯基洛夫Woroshiloff氏之「消化比較試騐」，謂荳類食品中蛋白質之消化時間，較肉類中之蛋白質，遲緩有二三倍之久。</p>
<p>查食物中之營養價値，約有二項：即　供養身體內部之組織，　供養身體內部之精力。凡食物中富蛋白質者，謂含氮食品，專供身體內部組織之生長發育，反之，凡食品中含有豐富之炭水化合物（即糖份澱粉質纖維質等）及脂肪而缺乏蛋白質者，謂含炭食品，專供身體內部之燃料，發生體熟及精力，並增加身體中之脂肪成分。荳類食品非惟含有特別豐富之蛋白質，同時脂肪成份亦甚多，故在營養上爲極有價値之食品，在我國古書中述及者亦多。本草云：「大荳蠶荳，甘平無毒，久服令人身重。」又云：「服食大荳蠶荳，救荒濟飢，快胃和臟腑。」又博物志云：「人食荳三年，則身重行動難。」又延年秘錄小：有「服大荳令人長肌膚，益顏色，塡骨髓，加氣力補虛能。」云云。</p>
<p>成分比較</p>
<p>茲將各種食物之成分作一比較，以示荳類食物之重耍也：</p>

<h3>中儲銀行發表　儲劵發行總額　準備金數量同時公布</h3>
<p>中央儲備銀行自成立以米，已逾四載於茲，蘇浙皖粤鄂等各省地區，均普遍設立分支行辦事處，發行通貨，亦普及各地區流通，現因國際情勢　　，對於中儲行通貨額　準備金數量，人民頗寄予重視。中央社記者茲據中央儲備銀行發表謂：「正金銀行因日方收買物資及其他支付等關係，前曾與中央儲備銀行訂有契約，陸續支借款項，該項借款向係隨時由日方以黃金作價償還，　至今未及淸還者，尙有相當金額，亦已由正金銀行向中儲以黃金結算淸償，中儲方面共應收進黃金計十三萬二千七百餘兩，合金條一萬三千二百餘條，已於今日全數交付巾央儲備銀行收管。中央儲備銀行現在所有金條，除金蹬劵準備金外，其發行中儲劵準備金方面，連前所購存者，共有金條二萬七千餘條。中儲劵發行總額，結至現在止，則共爲一萬九千萬萬元。」</p>

<h3>小母親——寄W</h3>
<p>— 宋廉</p>
<p>給抹去兩肩風塵，</p>
<p>醉捲於無被之雲。</p>
<p>挑絲紗帳夢　未　呢</p>
<p>柔萋在　、</p>
<p>偏一萬個不答應。</p>
<p>六年前，我的朋友從故鄕寫一封信來，報吿我他將結婚的消息，同時還托我給他寫一首祝賀的詩篇，印在請帖的後面。當然這是我應盡的責任，同時這一位朋友要眞的能結婚的話，　可以在我心上釋去一　爲他擔下的心事。當時我就胡亂地給替他寫了一點，趕快給他寄去</p>
<p>這個朋友除了是我的同鄕外，還是我的同學。我對他家庭的景况了解得最透澈；他是個絕頂聰願的人，不曾受得多少敎育，但是，對世界對社會，對生活，都有深的了解和統一的信念，我相信唯其這樣的人才是眞眞的幸福者。因爲他了解生活的本質，從他特有的信急出發，他擯　一切不需要的生活享受，他的確能够把自己從無限的官能的慾望裏提出來。但是我相信能够完成他這樣美好的倫理人格的十之八九是他家　環境的賜予，他有一個跟他年　只要十五歲的母親，　親在他二歲那年就無端的暴死了，但是後來證明他的死是中了酒毒。因爲他家祖上很有一點家產，所以他的父親也從不曾想要幹過一件任何買　，就這樣成年沉湎在酒罎子裏，但是從民國初年的中國家庭而論，不吹鴉片的總還不算是敗子。</p>
<p>至於他的母親呢，長得那麼小；她十五歲就結婚，十八歲已經享盡人間的一切廿苦，以後就一天又一天地像個陀螺樣轉下去，旣不能再長得商大一點，也不希望改　一下生活的方式，就只想畜猪畜狗似地將他孩子　大，替他結婚，再　他生兒子。本來　一切在有錢的人家幷不算是難事，這幾年來，　一直就在替他兒子物色相常的女子，除了一切她所認爲必要的「　妻良母」的條件外，她還吿訴我，他那位未來的媳婦必得是長得高大一點的，因為像　那樣瘦小，實在太可憐了。</p>
<p>我旣可憐這樣個母親，我又了解我的朋友的心情——</p>
<p>「……你給我想想，是那麼樣一個世界，她的兒子長在那麼樣轉變的時代裏，可是他又老不肯離開家鄕。與其將來遭受更難堪的苦痛，我看還是不結婚的好。」</p>
<p>我當然知道，是一個普通的人，不結婚怕是不可能的吧！而且在他的環境想十分延　結婚的年限，恐怕也是不可能的事。一則他的母親年齡很輕，想偸偸地離開了母親去結婚吧，良心上未免又說不過去。而且她的母親抱定，那一天不完遂她一生的大目的，那一天就不想把一個陌生的女子拉進她一生合作的家庭裏去，我　爲我的朋友一心。</p>
<p>但是朋友要結婚了！站在第三者的立塲上，本也是値得慶賀的，對於這一樁事情，我却不敢再想得更多一點。</p>
<p>結了婚就怎樣呢！朋友之間當然不免疏淡一點，我十足有四個年頭不接到他的信了，第五年，正月從另外一個朋友家裏轉來一盒紅蛋，一共是六個，整整齊齊放在玻璃盒子裏，盒上面貼了大紅喜字，朋友生兒子了！</p>
<p>生了兒子就好了，於是我猜那位新夫人一定是新　二棲的人物，很能够調和於老少之間的，朋友總算是幸福了。可是不久却接了朋友的來信。</p>
<p>「……也好，雖然第一個想法是破減了，可是　破減裏，又有我新生的了，我現在已經爲我自己滿足了慾望，爲我母親生下了兒子，再不走又作什麼呢？人類本身就是慾望的產物，更理智一點不更矛盾吧……最近我便要出國去……」</p>
<p>朋友出國去了要遝一去在學術上可以有一點造那去也未始不是一椿好事，要不然那委是太危險了，我知道我的朋友的心理已經不是正常的了，人類的腦袋有一天不長四個角，總沒一天會放平穩的。</p>
<p>太糟糕了，果然不出我所料，半年前從另外一個日本留學朋友那兒得到一個可靠的消息，可憐我的朋友又在鬧戀愛了，而且他飲酒飲得很兇，「　毒苦酒」人領略了這四個字，可慶幸的是我自己是個不吃酒的人。</p>
<p>上月，朋友的一個電報把我送回到六七年前曾一去的他家鄕裏。</p>
<p>「弟喪母，因要事　歸，煩代料理至感。」</p>
<p>一口異樣小的棺材放進一個白寥寥的屍體而已，我眞不敢相信這樣小得可憐的屍體也會活得那麼久，耐得下那麼多痛楚而且還像把它轉嫁到後代的身上去。她死了，旁邊沒有她的兒子，但是在她身傍有她偉大的創作——不又是一個小母親嗎？</p>
<p>出棺了——媳婦抱着孩子，四個土夫挑着靈巧的棺木靜靜地走過街邊，假如小人把我認作她老人家的兒子，我想她老人家也會不高興的吧，唉，朋友，你罪孽深重！</p>
<p>我回上海了，臨走，第二代的小母親給我淌下了一大堆淚珠——</p>
<p>朋友！你少作一點兒孽阿！</p>
<h3>我的影子</h3>
<p>— 端木夢歡</p>
<p>我，有的會任性地幹一些「莫明其妙」的事情，沒有什麼理由，我以爲也不一定要有什麼理由，我眞也幹得述自已也不明其所以然的。我祗覺得那時候一定要那樣的去幹，否則，就混身的不舒服。</p>
<p>人，眞的有時會不明瞭自己的嗎？</p>
<p>在一些爲我所厭惡的人　的前面，我把自己約束得像一個不會說得話的啞巴，而當和一些我所喜愛的人　在一起，我却又像把「說話」當作是一種「權利」，而儘量的不肯放鬆。</p>
<p>對於有一些人，我熱烈得像一團火，但，對另一些人，我却又冷酷得像一塊冰。</p>
<p>我愛我所愛的東西，甚至於不吝惜自已的生命，我恨我所恨的東西，我就連一根毛髮也不肯含糊假借。</p>
<p>因爲貪　沉靜和自由，我會深夜裏坐在晾台上，默默地想一些我所喜歡想的事情，看一些我所喜歡看的東西，像深藍色的天空和閃爍的星羣，吸一些沒有誰可干涉得的沉靜的空氣？</p>
<p>高興的時候，一天裏會發十幾封信，意與闌珊的時候，就連筆管也懶得提。</p>
<p>喜歡喝一些酒，就很留　那薄醉的時候，我覺得那時最天眞得可愛，可以「高歌常哭」，也可以「振筆疾書」，——我不懂得什麼理智不理智，我祗懂得眞的心，……</p>
<p>這是我的影子，我性格的寫實。</p>
<p>對於這些莫明其妙的事情，您懂得嗎？是呀！連我自已也不很懂得爲什麼定要如此做！</p>
<p>說眞的，您們也是不是常常如此的？譬如像控制不了自已的情感等等……</p>

<h3>Extraordinary Measures to Resolve the Current Situation: Japanese Emperor Issues Peace Rescript, Orders Government to Accept Joint Declaration of China, the United States, and the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The Japanese Emperor broadcast at noon on the 15th. In order to ensure that the entire population could listen, even areas without electricity were provided with temporary power. This broadcast was not only for Japan but was also simultaneously broadcast throughout Greater East Asia. It is also understood that following the Emperor's broadcast, Prime Minister Suzuki and the Japanese government made extremely important announcements regarding the current state of the Greater East Asia War. At the same time, all Japanese newspapers delayed publication to immediately publish this news after the Emperor's broadcast, communicating it to everyone.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency Telegram) – For the sake of peace, the Emperor commanded the government on the 14th to notify the four countries of China, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union of their acceptance of the Potsdam Declaration. Simultaneously, he issued a grand rescript, declaring the necessity of accepting the four countries' joint declaration, and personally broadcast the rescript at noon on the 15th.</p>
<h3>Rescript</h3>
<p>I, in view of the world situation and the current state of the Empire, desire to resolve the situation through extraordinary measures. I hereby inform you, my loyal subjects:</p>
<p>I have ordered the Imperial Government to notify the four countries of China, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union of its acceptance of their joint declaration.</p>
<p>To ensure the well-being of the Imperial subjects and to share the joy of common prosperity with all nations – this is the ancestral legacy of our Imperial ancestors and my constant concern. Formerly, we declared war on the United States and the United Kingdom, also with the expectation of ensuring the Empire's survival and the stability of East Asia. Rejecting the sovereignty of other nations and seizing territory was never my intention. However, the war has lasted for four years, and my army and navy have fought bravely, my officials have been diligent, and my one hundred million subjects have served the public to the best of their abilities. However, the war situation has not necessarily improved, and the general trend of the world is also unfavorable to us. Moreover, the enemy has used cruel bombs, frequently killing and wounding innocent people, causing immeasurable suffering. If the war continues, not only will our nation ultimately be destroyed, but human civilization will also be ruined. How then can I protect my countless subjects and answer to the spirits of the Imperial ancestors? Therefore, I have ordered the Imperial Government to accept the joint declaration.</p>
<p>I must express my regret to the allied nations that have consistently assisted Japan in liberating East Asia. My heart is torn for the Imperial subjects who have died in battle, died in the line of duty, or died untimely deaths, and for their families. I am deeply concerned for the welfare of those who have been wounded in battle, suffered disaster, or lost their homes.</p>
<p>However, the hardships the Empire will face in the future will undoubtedly be extraordinary. I also deeply understand the feelings of you, my subjects. However, I, in accordance with the dictates of fate, endure the unendurable to seek peace for all generations.</p>
<p>Here, I can maintain the national polity and trust in the loyalty of you, my subjects. I will stand with you, my subjects. As for those who are swayed by emotions, cause disturbances, or ostracize compatriots, confuse the situation, and betray trust in the world, these are what I most deeply caution against. I hope that the entire nation, united as one family, will pass on to future generations the firm belief that the Land of the Gods will not perish. Remembering that the task is heavy and the road is long, gather all strength for future construction, firmly believe in morality, steadfastly uphold principles, and vow to promote the spirit of the national polity without lagging behind the progress of the world. I hope that you, my subjects, will all understand my intentions.</p>
<h3>Potsdam Declaration: Japan Accepted</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to diplomatic sources here, before accepting the four countries' joint declaration, the Japanese government had engaged in diplomatic negotiations. That is, after the war situation became unfavorable to Japan and the general trend of the world became even more unfavorable, Japan had already made the greatest efforts to maintain the national polity. On November 27th of the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), China, the United States, and the United Kingdom held a meeting in Cairo and issued the Cairo Declaration, causing turmoil within Japan. However, the Japanese diplomatic authorities, calmly observing the war situation, had already considered peace. By May of this year, Germany had collapsed, and this view became even stronger. The Japanese government then used the Soviet Union, which maintained a neutral relationship, as an intermediary to strive for peace with the United Kingdom and the United States. However, on July 26th of this year, the three countries issued the Potsdam Joint Declaration, stating that this was a final ultimatum to Japan. The Japanese government then adopted an attitude of ignoring it. Who knew that the diplomatic significance of Japan's ignoring it would become the reason for the Soviet Union to declare war? The Soviet Union's declaration of war revealed the fact that Japan was trying to enlist the Soviet Union's help to seek peace. Because of the Soviet Union's declaration of war, Japan's diplomatic efforts all came to naught. What's more, the appearance of the atomic bomb had already made it impossible to continue the war. On August 9th, the Japanese government issued a notice accepting the Potsdam Declaration. This notice was based on the understanding that the authority of the Supreme Ruler would not be harmed. The four countries sent a reply to Tokyo on the 13th. From this, the Japanese government knew that the institution of the Emperor had been secured and thus surrendered to the four countries of China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Central News Agency Report – According to Domei News Agency, Tokyo, 15th, the Japanese government held several Supreme War Guidance Conferences and extraordinary cabinet meetings from the 9th to the 14th regarding the acceptance of the Potsdam Declaration. On the 9th, a Supreme War Guidance Conference was held in the Imperial Palace from 2:30 PM to 5:30 PM. An extraordinary cabinet meeting was held at the Prime Minister's residence from 6:30 PM to 10:10 PM to hear the opinions of the Prime Minister and others. From 11:55 PM to 3:00 AM the next morning, an Imperial Conference was held in the Imperial Palace to decide to accept the Potsdam Declaration. Continuing from 3:10 AM to 4:00 AM, an extraordinary cabinet meeting was held at the Prime Minister's residence to review the method of announcement. At 7:00 AM on the 11th, the Swiss government was asked to notify of the intention to accept. On the 12th, from 2:05 PM to 2:44 PM, Prime Minister Suzuki went to the Imperial Palace to report. From 3:00 PM to 5:30 PM, a cabinet meeting was held to exchange opinions. At the same time, the Imperial Family Council was held in the Imperial Palace from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM. At 8:00 AM on the 13th, the official reply from the United Nations was received. From 8:50 AM to 9:10 AM, the Supreme War Guidance Conference was held, attended by the Prime Minister, the Ministers of the Army, Navy, and Foreign Affairs, the Chief of the General Staff, and the Chief of the Naval General Staff, totaling six people. It was reconvened from 10:30 AM to 3:00 PM to discuss the issue of maintaining the national polity. From 4:00 PM to 7:30 PM, a cabinet meeting was held, but opinions could not be unified. On the 14th, Prime Minister Suzuki went to the Imperial Palace twice. An Imperial Conference was held. At 10:00 AM, a Marshal's Conference was held in the Imperial Palace. From 10:45 AM to noon, an unprecedented Imperial Conference was held in the Imperial Palace. After leaving the palace, three cabinet meetings were held in succession. By 8:30 PM, the Prime Minister went to the Imperial Palace again, completing all procedures and deciding to issue the rescript.</p>
<h3>Highest Commanders of the Japanese Army and Navy in Shanghai Issue Announcement: Those Who Hinder Public Order Will Be Dealt With According to Military Law</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Shanghai Report – The highest commanders of the Japanese Army and Navy on the ground issued the following announcement on the 15th:</p>
<p>In light of this new situation, the Japanese military believes that ensuring public order is the most critical measure for maintaining and enhancing the well-being of the Chinese people. Therefore, the Japanese military on the ground, in accordance with the orders of superiors, will temporarily continue to carry out the task of ensuring public order. We sincerely hope that the Chinese people will trust the Japanese military, not be misled by rumors, maintain a calm attitude throughout, and cooperate with the Japanese military in maintaining public order.</p>
<p>"Anyone who obstructs our public order and security operations will be regarded by our military as an enemy of the people and will be dealt with in the most severe manner in accordance with military law."</p>
<h3>Japanese Prime Minister Suzuki Broadcasts to the Nation</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Prime Minister Suzuki broadcast to the Japanese nation at 7:00 PM on the 15th, briefly stating that with the Imperial Rescript issued, the direction for the nation from now on has been set. The difficult future can only be pioneered through the efforts of the people. From now on, the people should wholeheartedly maintain the national polity, and internal strife and rash actions should be strictly avoided. In the future, we must always do our utmost to rescue the families of war victims and wounded soldiers.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency Telegram) – After the Emperor decided to end the Greater East Asia War on the 14th, Prime Minister Suzuki issued the following Cabinet Edict:</p>
<p>Today, we respectfully receive the Imperial Rescript. The Empire has been engaged in the Greater East Asia War for nearly four years. Now, His Majesty has taken extraordinary measures to end the war, for which we, as subjects, are filled with unspeakable fear. Since the beginning of the war, countless soldiers have exposed their bones in foreign lands, and the damage to the homeland and the sacrifices of the innocent have reached their limits. The purpose of the war cannot be achieved, and the war situation is not necessarily favorable. Furthermore, a new type of bomb with unprecedented destructive power in the history of science has been used, causing a dramatic change in the war situation. Following the Soviet Union's declaration of war on the Empire on the 9th, the Empire has encountered unprecedented difficulties. His Majesty, in his boundless concern for world peace and the well-being of his subjects, has issued a rescript. Now that the Imperial decision has been made, the path that we, as his subjects, should follow is clear. The Empire's future will therefore be even more difficult, and the people must endure hardship. However, the Empire must, through the fruits of this endurance, pioneer the nation's future destiny. With a heart full of tears, I swear to my compatriots that what the people should do today is only to maintain the national polity. We must not cling to the past, suspect each other, or engage in internal strife, allowing others to take advantage of us, or be swayed by emotions and act rashly, betraying trust in the world. Furthermore, we must do our utmost to support the bereaved families of those who died in battle and war victims, as well as wounded soldiers. The government promises to work diligently and strive diligently with the people to embody the Emperor's will and restore national prestige to live up to the legacy of our ancestors. Furthermore, one more thing that should be said at this time is regarding the task of officials in this difficult situation. His Majesty the Emperor proclaimed, "I deeply understand the feelings of you, my subjects." I hope that officials will follow this benevolent Imperial will and become pioneers in arousing the spirit of revival.</p>
<h3>Japan Establishes Post-War Countermeasures Committee</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report – According to Domei News Agency, Tokyo, 15th, the Japanese government has decided to establish a Post-War Countermeasures Committee. Its task is to promote post-war reconstruction, increase food production, ensure transportation capacity, and suppress inflation.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Allows Japanese Residents Freedom of Movement</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 13th (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to a Moscow dispatch, staff members of the Japanese Embassy in Moscow and special correspondents of news agencies, currently residing in Ambassador Sato's residence or the Ambassador's official residence, are allowed freedom of movement without any restrictions. For example, purchasing food and telephone communication are as usual. However, wireless radios and weapons have been confiscated, and everyone is very safe.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Calm and Composure</h3>
<p>Yesterday, this newspaper discussed how ordinary citizens should respond to the environment, emphasizing that calm and composure are the most important things. This is what is meant by "responding to all changes with immutability." Of course, this method of dealing with changes in the situation, whether it is a reversal or a smooth transition, cannot be ignored. Especially when turning from adversity to prosperity, it is easy to arouse pride and agitation in people's hearts, and the results of pride and agitation are often enough to spoil things. Moreover, the affairs of the local area, society, and country are more important than personal affairs. Therefore, in times of changing circumstances, avoid recklessness and restlessness. Only by ensuring that everyone knows how to be calm, everyone maintains order, everyone stays in their position, and everyone fulfills their duties, can we stabilize the changes in the situation in a calm and dutiful manner, which is beneficial to both private and public interests. Only then can we be considered citizens of the new era, and can we stand firm in the new society of the future.</p>
<p>Indeed, the current situation is in a period of transition, and emotional excitement is, of course, human nature. However, we must have rational excitement, not emotional excitement. Emotional excitement is agitation, which only leads to mistakes and cannot accomplish anything. Rational excitement is calm. Although the heart is excited, the outward appearance must be calm. Reason restrains emotion, so that we can shoulder heavy responsibilities and go far.</p>
<p>Secondly, during times of fluctuating circumstances, due to the stimulation of interests, people are prone to a state of unease. Unease leads to panic, and panic leads to agitation. The former is emotional agitation, manifested in reckless behavior; the latter is psychological agitation, manifested in the economic sphere. Now the situation has reached a turning point, and there is no room for speculation or rumors. At the same time, there are many areas where we need each of our people to stay in their positions and work hard. We must not engage in agitated behavior again. We must be calm and composed and overcome this difficult situation together. As far as this city is concerned, we can solemnly inform the citizens that, first, regarding the value of the Central Reserve Certificates (CRC) that everyone is concerned about, the relevant authorities have already discussed a stabilization plan. Yesterday, the Central Reserve authorities also announced the total amount of issuance and the amount of reserves. Therefore, the value of the Central Reserve Certificates can now be calculated definitively and is not as panic-stricken as the general public's psychology suggests. Second, regarding local public order, both China and Japan have already directly and indirectly discussed concrete and effective ways to maintain it in this situation. As long as all citizens can be calm and cooperative with a heart that loves the country and the local area, and do not allow unscrupulous elements to take the opportunity to stir up trouble, problems can absolutely be avoided.</p>
<p>These two most pressing problems already have fairly reliable solutions. Each of us citizens can dispel the unnecessary dark clouds in our hearts, abandon unnecessary doubts, and be content and do what a good citizen should do. At the same time, the country and society especially hope that every citizen can do so.</p>
<p>In addition to passively refraining from words and deeds that endanger public order and people's livelihoods, a true patriot must also actively assist in maintaining order and protecting people's livelihoods. In assisting in maintaining public order, we believe that the first step should be to strengthen the work of the baojia and self-defense corps, so that the people can use their own strength to guard and protect local public order. In assisting in protecting people's livelihoods, ordinary citizens should not be in a hurry to exchange banknotes for goods, lest everyone follows suit and creates a dangerous situation of rising prices. Citizens in the business community, in particular, should share the burden during these difficult times and never take advantage of any opportunity to close markets or raise prices, so as to demonstrate the moral heart of a merchant. If people only know how to find ways to shift the damage to others, their hearts are already unworthy of inquiry. How can we talk about patriotism then?</p>
<p>In order to achieve "calmness first" and ensure local tranquility, the local authorities and all citizens must work together to maintain public order and protect people's livelihoods. More importantly, we must put the nation and the people first. At this turning point in the situation, whether we are humiliated or honored depends entirely on our calm and composure, recognizing reality, and making wise choices.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Tani Broadcasts to Japanese Residents in China: Hopes for Calm, Composure, Forbearance, and Self-Control</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th – Japanese Ambassador Tani broadcast to Japanese residents in China starting at 7:00 PM on the 15th. The original text is as follows: "At noon today, His Majesty the Emperor personally broadcast, bestowing the Imperial Rescript upon 100 million compatriots. I am truly terrified. In the face of this unprecedented national crisis, we listened to the Imperial voice and, in addition to grief, felt our spirits doubled. This time, the Imperial Government, in order to save the nation from destruction and civilization from ruin, has accepted the Potsdam Declaration. By accepting this, Japan, with its 2,600-year glorious history, will from now on step onto a thorny path of unprecedented hardship and trials, which has been placed upon our shoulders. The Yamato race, born to live and die, must maintain the national polity, make the greatest endurance, seek the peace of the Imperial nation for all ages, and exert the spirit of the nation. This is the time to do so. History is a long history. In this long history, if we can embrace this spirit, uphold the pride and tradition of a glorious nation, and devote all our efforts to move forward, we firmly believe that there will be a future. The national difficulties that compatriots in foreign lands will encounter in the future will be greater than those encountered by compatriots in the homeland. We should overcome them with greater courage, and the country will do its utmost to ensure the protection of the lives and property of its overseas residents. I hope that everyone will maintain a calm attitude, exert the Japanese spirit, and devote their sincerity to serving the public. In particular, we must be wary of acting rashly out of emotion and bringing disaster upon ourselves. To reiterate, the spirit of the new policy towards China must remain unchanged. Respond to change with immutability. It is most important that everyone stays in their positions. If we are deceived by emotion and destroy production facilities, we will not only be betraying the Imperial Edict but also harming the future of the nation. In short, from now on, we should remember every word of the Imperial Rescript and act in accordance with it in our daily lives. As the Imperial Rescript states, the Land of the Gods will surely not perish, and righteousness will surely be seen again. I sincerely hope that the overseas Chinese in China will be calm, composed, forbearing, and self-controlled, embody the Imperial will, and adopt an attitude that is not shameful to China or foreign countries."</p>

<h3>Advocating Eating Beans (1)</h3>
<p>— Shanghai St. John's University College of Agriculture</p>
<p>When rice and wheat are scarce, the best substitute grains are soybeans and broad beans. Soybeans were anciently called "Rongshu," because the color of the beans varies in green, yellow, black, and white. Commonly named yellow beans, green beans, and black beans, the academic name "soybean" is more reasonable than naming them simply by color.</p>
<p>Soybeans originated in China, with a cultivation history of over 5,000 years. Since China participated in the Vienna World Exposition in Austria in 1873, Chinese soybeans have become known throughout the world. Broad beans, also known as "Hudou," are among the oldest cultivated leguminous crops, originating in Southeast Asia. They are named "broad beans" because they ripen during silkworm season. Some say they are named for the shape of their pods, which resemble silkworms.</p>
<p>China has always used soybeans and broad beans as famine-relief crops when rice and grains are scarce. This is repeatedly mentioned in ancient agricultural texts. The book by Fan Shengzhi says: "Soybeans are suitable for preserving the year and were the ancient way to prepare for lean years." Wang Zhen's "Book of Agriculture" states: "Soybeans are edible and can fill hunger, making them useful for lean years." "Compendium of Materia Medica" records: "Zhang Qian, when sent to foreign countries, obtained broad bean seeds and brought them back. The people of Sichuan collected their seeds to prepare for famine." The biography of Feng Yi in the "Book of Later Han" says, "Emperor Guangwu told his generals, 'Yesterday, I had Gongsun's bean porridge, which relieved both hunger and cold.'" Wang Zhen's "Book of Agriculture" also states, "Broad beans are the earliest among all grains, can be steamed, boiled, and are easy to eat, replacing new rice and filling the stomach." Mr. Xuan Hu said, "Broad beans are extremely helpful in relieving the urgency of farmers and are not eaten by locusts." Due to their wide range of uses, many European and American countries now cultivate these beans.</p>
<p>Nutritional Value</p>
<p>Soybeans, broad beans, peas, peanuts, etc., all belong to leguminous crops in botany, and their nutritional values are roughly similar. The protein content is extremely rich. Soybeans contain about 34%, and the fat content is also high, accounting for about 17%. At the same time, carbohydrates (i.e., sugars, starches, and fibers) are also abundant. According to nutritional value calculations, fat is equivalent to two and a quarter times the carbohydrates during digestion. After soybeans are fully mature, the starch content is almost zero. Among the ash content of beans, iron and potassium are particularly abundant, with potassium phosphate accounting for about 80%. In ordinary food, starches and other carbohydrates are mostly abundant, which can supply the human body with sufficient carbon. However, the most important nitrogenous component is lacking in most foods, except for legumes, where it is particularly abundant. Therefore, to supplement these essential nutrients, one must eat more beans. The nitrogenous component in beans is in the form of plant casein, similar to casein in milk. According to chemical analysis, leguminous crops, in addition to containing a suitable amount of starch, also have extremely rich protein and fat components, no less than excellent beef. If the nutritional calories are compared pound for pound, soybeans and broad beans are more nutritious than meat and grains. More than sixty years ago, Mr. Moleschott stated, "Peas surpass beef, soybeans surpass pigeon meat, and any kind of meat is far behind." Therefore, bean foods are superior to meat. According to Mr. Voit's research, the nourishing components in bean foods are mostly contained in cells surrounded by coarse fiber, so they are not easily completely digested and absorbed by the stomach and intestines immediately after eating, thus providing a feeling of fullness. Mr. Galen's testimony also proves that "bean foods are not as easily digested as other foods, and eating them easily leads to nightmares." Therefore, this type of food is very suitable for manual laborers, such as students, soldiers, workers, and those who work outdoors, because it is filling and also nourishing. Mr. Hoffman conducted a digestive test on bean foods and meat foods in the human body. The results showed that within the same digestion time, the digestion rate of protein in beans was 53%, while the digestion rate in meat was 82.3%. Therefore, the digestion time of protein in beans is slower than that in meat. According to Mr. Woroshiloff's "Comparative Digestion Test," the digestion time of protein in bean foods is two to three times slower than that of protein in meat.</p>
<p>The nutritional value of food can be divided into two aspects: 1) Nourishing the internal tissues of the body; 2) Providing energy to the body. Foods rich in protein are called nitrogenous foods and are specifically for the growth and development of the body's internal tissues. Conversely, foods rich in carbohydrates (i.e., sugars, starches, fibers, etc.) and fats but lacking protein are called carbonaceous foods and are specifically for providing fuel for the body, generating heat and energy, and increasing the body's fat content. Bean foods not only contain particularly rich protein but also have a high fat content, making them extremely valuable foods nutritionally. They are also mentioned in many ancient Chinese books. "Compendium of Materia Medica" states: "Soybeans and broad beans are sweet, neutral, and non-toxic; prolonged consumption can make the body heavy." It also says: "Eating soybeans and broad beans can relieve famine and hunger, and benefit the stomach and internal organs." "Records of Diverse Matters" states: "A person who eats beans for three years will become heavy and have difficulty moving." "Secret Records for Prolonging Life" contains: "Eating soybeans can grow muscles, improve complexion, fill bone marrow, increase strength, and replenish deficiencies."</p>
<p>Composition Comparison</p>
<p>Here is a comparison of the composition of various foods to show the importance of bean foods:</p>

<p>The Central Reserve Bank has been established for over four years, with branches and offices established in provinces such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Guangdong, and Hubei. The issuance of currency has also spread to various regions.

The outstanding amount that has not yet been repaid is still considerable, and the Yokohama Specie Bank has already settled the debt with the Central Reserve Bank in gold. The Central Reserve Bank should receive a total of over 132,700 taels of gold and over 13,200 gold bars, which have been fully delivered to the Central Reserve Bank for safekeeping today. The Central Reserve Bank currently has over 27,000 gold bars, excluding those for gold savings certificate reserves, which are used for issuing Central Reserve Bank notes.

<h3>Secretary-General Luo Encourages Citizens to Strive to Defend Shanghai; Baojia Office Convenes Emergency Joint Security Meeting</h3>
<p>As the international situation changes, the city's security is being maintained and ensured by the military and police authorities. The Baojia Office of the Municipal Police Bureau, recognizing the heavy responsibility of the current Baojia personnel to assist the authorities in maintaining local security, specially convened an emergency joint security meeting at the Golden Grand Theater yesterday (the 15th) at 4 p.m. The meeting was attended by the heads and deputy heads of the joint Baojia from all 18 districts of the city. Secretary-General Luo of the Municipal Government and Director Gu of the Baojia Office personally attended the meeting to deliver instructions, encouraging the Baojia personnel of the city to intensify their service with the responsibility of defending the country and local security, and to maintain the Greater Shanghai. Mr. Shen Siliang, Chairman of the Municipal District Baojia Committee and Director of the Ning District Sub-Bureau, also delivered a speech, expressing the hope that all would cooperate under the guidance of the authorities to undertake the responsibilities they should bear. Subsequently, the participants unanimously passed several important proposals on maintaining the security and tranquility of Shanghai. The meeting adjourned at 5:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Secretary-General Luo's Instructions</p>
<p>Secretary-General Luo's instructions, in brief, stated: "In today's hot weather, at a time when the situation is extremely tense, your taking the time to attend this meeting fully demonstrates your spirit of serving the local community, which is deeply gratifying. I deeply feel that in the current situation, the responsibility of our Baojia has become particularly heavy. Shanghai is not only a major city in China but also one of the major cities in the world of East Asia. In recent years, many cities in the world have suffered destruction or devastation due to war. However, Shanghai has remained relatively intact during this severe period, maintaining its status. Although the people's lives are quite difficult, they are still able to live in peace, which should be a blessing for the citizens of the city. Therefore, in the future, we, especially the Baojia personnel of the civil organizations, should grit our teeth and take on the responsibility of maintaining local security, ensuring that there is not the slightest bit of destruction, and completing the task safely. At the same time, I deeply believe that every citizen is willing to protect the security of Shanghai. Looking back on my tenure in Shanghai for several months, although I have not made any outstanding contributions to the local community, I have strived to maintain local order. I hope that at this time, you will spare no effort, endure hardship, and concentrate your energy to defend Shanghai with all your might, and strive to maintain it until the very end. If there are those who disrupt the security, we will not hesitate to shed blood to stop them, until the very last moment. Shanghai is Shanghai of China, and it is also Shanghai of five million citizens. We should remain calm, united, and serve the country with conscience. As long as we are true to ourselves and true to the country, we will have no regrets. Today, with the most sincere and firm determination, I deeply hope that everyone will jointly defend Shanghai, protect the lives and property of five million people, and preserve the vitality of China. I am willing to follow behind you all, and do my best to maintain Shanghai, and will never retreat. As the saying goes, 'Unity is strength.' With this determination, we will achieve a situation where human determination overcomes fire, do our best to protect ourselves with human power, create an environment, and remain steadfast every second. I am willing to start again with a new concept, and further strengthen our efforts."</p>
<p>Director Gu's Instructions at the Baojia Office</p>
<p>Director Gu of the Baojia Office stated briefly in his instructions: "In view of the current emergency situation, we are convening this special meeting again. The level of Baojia work today is generally viewed favorably in public opinion, which is the result of everyone's joint efforts. My work in the Baojia is not to build bridges for the office but to seek greater progress and political enlightenment for China. In the past, everyone has worked hard in Baojia work, striving to serve the local community, and has made some achievements. In the future, we should strengthen our efforts to maintain the local community. All countries in the world strive to ensure that their people live and work in peace and contentment, and the Baojia work is based on this aim, to promote social tranquility and benefit the future of the country and the nation. Our aim is to focus only on cultivating and not asking about the harvest. We deeply believe that those in this city who are respected and have a reputation in society will definitely strive to serve the local community and contribute to the country and the nation. I hope that everyone will uphold the purpose of serving the local community and preserving vitality, and guide the people. At this time of tense situation, we must strive to maintain the security of Shanghai, turn the efforts of the past into fruits today, and complete the final Baojia mission."</p>

<h3>Little Mother—Dedicated to W</h3>
<p>— Song Lian</p>
<p>Brushing away the dust of travel from her shoulders,</p>
<p>Drunk, she curled up in a cloud without a quilt.</p>
<p>Picking at the silken gauze of a dream, not yet...</p>
<p>Tenderness lies within,</p>
<p>Yet a resounding "no" ten thousand times over.</p>
<p>Six years ago, my friend wrote me a letter from his hometown, informing me of his upcoming marriage and asking me to write a congratulatory poem to be printed on the back of the invitation. Naturally, this was my responsibility, and if this friend could truly get married, it would relieve a burden I had carried for him. I hastily scribbled something and sent it off.</p>
<p>This friend was not only from my hometown but also my classmate. I knew his family situation very well. He was exceptionally intelligent, hadn't received much education, but had a deep understanding and unified belief about the world, society, and life. I believe such a person is truly happy because he understands the essence of life. Starting from his unique convictions, he rejected all unnecessary worldly pleasures, and he was indeed able to extract himself from the infinite desires of the senses. But I believe that eight or nine out of ten of the reasons he could accomplish such a beautiful ethical character was a gift from his family environment: he had a mother only fifteen years older than him. His own father had died suddenly and inexplicably when he was two, but it was later proven that he had died from alcohol poisoning. Because his family had some ancestral property, his father never wanted to engage in any business, spending his adult life immersed in liquor jars. However, from the perspective of Chinese families in the early Republic of China, not smoking opium was still not considered a wastrel.</p>
<p>As for his mother, she was so small. She married at fifteen, enjoyed all the hardships of the world by eighteen, and since then has spun like a top day after day, neither growing any taller nor hoping to change her way of life, only wanting to raise her child like raising a pig or a dog, to marry him off and then wait for him to have a son. Originally, all of this wasn't difficult in wealthy families. Over the past few years, she has been finding a suitable woman for her son. Besides the "good wife and mother" qualities she deemed necessary, she also told me that his future daughter-in-law had to be tall because being as petite as she was, was truly pitiful.</p>
<p>I pitied such a mother, and I understood my friend's feelings:</p>
<p>"...Think about the kind of world she's in. Her son grew up in such a changing era, but he refuses to leave his hometown. Instead of suffering even more terrible pain in the future, I think it's better not to get married."</p>
<p>Of course, I knew that for an ordinary person, not getting married was probably impossible. And in his circumstances, significantly delaying marriage was probably impossible. On the one hand, his mother was young, and trying to secretly leave his mother to get married would prick his conscience. Moreover, his mother was determined not to accomplish her life's great goal, not wanting to pull a stranger into the family she had built her life around. I worried for my friend.</p>
<p>But my friend was getting married! From a third-party perspective, it was something to celebrate, but I dared not think about it too much.</p>
<p>What would happen after marriage? Of course, friendships would inevitably fade a little. For four whole years, I didn't receive any letters from him. In the fifth year, during the first month of the Lunar New Year, a box of red eggs arrived from another friend's house, six in total, neatly placed in a glass box with a large red "happiness" character pasted on top. My friend had a son!</p>
<p>Having a son was a good thing. I guessed that the new wife must be someone who could manage both traditional and modern things, able to reconcile the old and the young, and that my friend was finally happy. But soon after, I received a letter from my friend:</p>
<p>"...Well, although the initial idea has been broken, within that brokenness, I have something new. I have now satisfied my own desires and given my mother a grandson. What else is there to do if I don't leave? Humanity itself is the product of desire, wouldn't being more rational be more contradictory? ... I'm going abroad soon..."</p>
<p>My friend going abroad to study and perhaps achieve something in academics wasn't necessarily a bad thing. Otherwise, it would be too dangerous. I knew my friend's mental state was no longer normal. Humanity's brains won't calm down until they grow four horns.</p>
<p>Too bad, just as I expected, half a year ago, I received reliable news from another friend studying in Japan. My poor friend was having an affair, and he was drinking heavily. "Poisonous bitter wine," people have tasted these four characters. I am fortunate to be someone who doesn't drink.</p>
<p>Last month, a telegram from my friend sent me back to his hometown that I had visited six or seven years ago.</p>
<p>"Brother lost mother, due to important matter unable return, please handle funeral deeply grateful."</p>
<p>A coffin that was extraordinarily small contained only a stark white body. I couldn't believe that such a pitifully small body could have lived so long, endured so much pain, and even seemed to transfer it to future generations. She died, her son wasn't beside her, but beside her was her great creation—wasn't it another little mother?</p>
<p>The coffin was carried out - the daughter-in-law held the child, four laborers carried the nimble coffin quietly walking along the streets. If small people mistook me for her son, I think she wouldn't have been happy. Alas, friend, your sins are heavy!</p>
<p>I returned to Shanghai. Before leaving, the second-generation little mother shed a flood of tears for me -</p>
<p>Friend! Commit a little less evil!</p>
<h3>My Shadow</h3>
<p>— Duanmu Menghuan</p>
<p>Sometimes, I will willfully do some "inexplicable" things. There's no reason, and I don't think there needs to be any reason. Even I myself don't understand why I do them. I just feel that at that time, I must do them that way, otherwise, I feel uncomfortable all over.</p>
<p>Can people really not understand themselves sometimes?</p>
<p>In front of some people I dislike, I restrain myself like a mute who can't speak. But when I'm with some people I like, I treat "speaking" as a "right" and try not to relax.</p>
<p>To some people, I'm as passionate as fire, but to others, I'm as cold as ice.</p>
<p>I love what I love, even to the point of not begrudging my own life. I hate what I hate, and I won't even tolerate a single hair of it.</p>
<p>Because I crave quiet and freedom, I will sit on the balcony late at night, silently thinking about things I like to think about, watching things I like to watch, like the deep blue sky and the glittering stars, and breathing the quiet air that no one can interfere with.</p>
<p>When I'm happy, I can send more than a dozen letters in a day. When I'm bored, I'm too lazy to even pick up a pen.</p>
<p>I like to drink some wine and cherish that tipsy feeling. I feel that I'm most innocent and lovable at that time. I can "sing loudly and cry," and I can "write quickly." I don't understand what's rational or irrational. I only understand the true heart...</p>
<p>This is my shadow, a realistic portrayal of my personality.</p>
<p>Do you understand these inexplicable things? Yes! Even I don't quite understand why I have to do them this way!</p>
<p>Honestly, don't you often do the same? For example, not being able to control your emotions, etc...</p>
