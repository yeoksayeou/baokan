<h3>日恢復和平　須經三階段</h3>
<p>中央社訊　據同盟社東京十六日電，指出目前戰爭雖已停止，要達到完全和平階段，尚須經過三個階段。第一，由日太政府命令陸海軍於何月何日何時停止一切戰爭行為，中國。南洋。太平洋各戰綫，完全邀行，照會四國停止戰鬥。第二，為簽訂停戰協定，美國方面已派定麥克沃華元帥為代表，其他三國預料亦即將派定，如此軍事行為之停止，即獲得法的根據。第三，為休戰條約之調印，即根據波次坦宣言，具體決定軍艦，武器之引渡，軍事立塲之處理，佔領贊賠償等項，須休戰條約成立後，方能完全脫離戰爭狀態。然休戰條約之締結，非短期內可以辦到，在此期內，獨立國家主權自然不能恢復，國民須抱困苦之覺悟，以等待媾和條約之締結，　斯時日本乃能恢復國際地位，派遺使節至國外也。</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>大國民風度</h3>
<p>全世界的和平，已經面臨吾人之前。全世界人們長時期的渴望，已將完全實現。無論何人，都不自禁其內心的興奮。不過，我們昨天已經說過，內心雖然興奮，而外表務必鎮靜，以理智約束情感，才能擔當更艱鉅的未來任務。</p>
<p>為什麽要鎭靜呢？就是希望做到：「寗靜致遠」。因為戰爭固然結束了，和平固然資現了，可是，緊接着的是怎樣維護治安，保持秩序，使和平工作順利推進？尤共是怎樣加緊團結，野無遺村，使復興建設工作循序推進？道些工作，都是迫切需要，決不是一時興奮所能推動，決不是輕舉妄動所能成就。所以，為共同擔常和平工作的順利完成，共同負起復興工作的重任，大家必須在政府決定的辦法之下，接受政府的指示之下，各個努力，以收分工合作之效。</p>
<p>我們得到今天的和平，大部分人民，都曾經過長時間艱苦的磨練，而未來的復興建設工作，又是範圍廣大貴任艱鉅。今後正需要經過磨練體捻的志士，以及多方面的人才，共同參加工作。因此，我們着眼於完成未來復建工作的重要性，與其消極的淸算是非，不如積極的重巾正義，寬大為懷，揭樂目標，號召奮力，俾使隱思負辱之士，激於正義，感恩國報，羣效死力，深信愛國天良，誰甘久泯，對於目前的和平工作與即將展開的的復興建設工作之中，莫不存轉憑之想。</p>
<p>頃讀本市政治特派員公署佈吿，希望市民遵照中央意旨，況着鎭靜，切實維護秩序，對於日本僑民，應木寬大同情之大國民風度，母以無體相加。我們讀到「大國民風度」一句，不禁感愧交倂。而我們經過八年以來第一次讀到是項佈告，更覺是中國政洽前途淸明之曙光。因為「大國民風度」，資在堙沒已久。近年上海的社會現象，充滿投機欺騙，自私自利，一旦時局轉變，立即情感衝動，表現於輕率行動，距離「大國民風度」不啻千里。現在當局特別指出「應本寬大同情之大國民風度」，母以無禮根加加於日木僑民，足見期望上海市民個個能有「寬大同情」之心，做到眞正大國民風度。</p>
<p>人民有了大國民風度，國家就有大國家風度。大國民風度本於寬大之同情，則大國家風度也木於寬大之同情自無疑義。國家對於人民要求木於寬大同情而有大國民風度，同時，人民對於國家也要求木於寬大同情而有大國家風度。</p>
<p>在此步入新時代之際，展開復興建設新中國工作之際，國家應有大國家風度，國民應有大國民風度，以期重建戰爭以來已　墮落的國民道德，而實踐大國家與大國民風度的步驟，惟有　寬大為懷，不咎既往。　立即放棄為一己私利的投機行為。　凡事從遠處着眼，近處入手。服從　令，遵守秩序。當此國家興盛的轉捩關頭，大家把握除舊更新，從新做人的機會，前進努力！</p>
<p>近郊通訊</p>
<h3>浦東現況</h3>
<p>— 李文忠</p>
<p>浦東本來已經有勃興的希望，舉凡水電廠等的建設，渡輪的革新，在浦東大道上也行駛了　大的公共汽車。經戰事後，面目全非。</p>
<p>市容不整　從前浦東的繁華地區，在賴泥渡大街，長凡爾里許，市肆　比，刻今唯瓦　重重，蔓蕀爲　；於是商店機關咸集中於東昌路，去年十一月間，突遭空襲，死傷凡二百人左右，緣此居住東昌路附近客籍居民，紛紛回鄉，市容更覺不振。</p>
<p>東昌路之盡頭，迎接浦東大道，浦東大道北經洋涇鎭至高　，（慶寗寺），南達周浦鎭，有民辦長途汽車通行，每各旅費三萬元，箱通商買。周浦又為米市集散之區，市肆繁榮，淩駕東昌路之上，而睹風熾甚。慶寗寺則為塵市中心，滬郊貧民肩挑担負，謀十一之利，以資糊口，沿途剝削重重，今此風雖已稍殺，然尙未盡除也。</p>
<p>貧農充斥　浦東大道兩旁，阡陌交通，盡皆耕地，載前多半荒蕪，刻今農產物奇昂，農民競相懇　，毋有委　，　乎人口過剩，家有十畝者，已屬難能可貴，結果耕地多委婦嫗之弱爲之，男子多半覓工商為業。農田之施肥，毫無目標，稱植又泥守成法，豐歡但聽天命，而農具又不完備，室於畜收等副產，亦以不　經營，　有嘗試者。總而言之，多屬貧農，唯蔬菜則可販運上海，故產量頗多。</p>
<p>東島路之北沿浦一帶，戰前工廠林立，刻今多半停閉，其中頤中公司依然製造捲菸。</p>
<p>沿浦客民　集，尤以江淮維　為著，構茅屋而居，一切均克耐勞克苦。唯敎育低落，迷信特甚。次則浙鄞客民，為數亦夥。</p>
<p>文化低落　浦東民風素稱儉樸耐勞，刻今百物飛騰，婦幼成負米販鹽，更感動勞。唯迷信特甚，知識低落，兒女合婚必待「日者」推算命理。家有病人，必先問上求神，而子女長成每多遠慮父母，居民　有　大思想，曾為人譏謂：「心計不出米襲，出門不及百里」。此或因地理使然！至於熱鬧市鎭，則多章海奢華，亦步亦趨，而風俗亦差。浦束南區教育事業：因無相常校舍，故皆因陋就簡，小學市私立合計約有十幾校，中學則有三所即振新，吳東，竣德。其他尙有師範一所，　校址尙多周　，在籌備中云。聞下學期私校殊難維持，亦浦東教育界之一大打擊，甚希教育常局，予以補救。</p>
<p>迷信盛行宗教方面：以信佛教爲最多，張家樓則多屬基督教徒，近年來更有「一　道」，風起雲湧，（又名崇華堂）意為諸敎貫一，兼採孔孟學說，並設　　，托詞神佛，信敎者以男爲乾道，女爲坤道；每一敎堂供奉觀音濟公彌勒等像錯綜複雜，莫知適從，呼教主爲點禪師每一巨鎭，皆分設敎堂，並亦辦理施診等，然因不脫迷信氣質，成見謬誤偽識者所笑，但並無所識不軌行動，以意測之，每逢時局不靖，人民精神肉體兩受痛苦，聞有虛無飄渺之說，遂信以為能解萬般「魔劫」，於是景然盲從矣！</p>
<h3>日與中美英蘇四國　交換外交文書正文</h3>

<p>自投降時起，天皇及日本國政府之國家統一權限，應置於聯合國最高指揮官為實施投降條件上必要措置之制限之下，天皇應予日本國政府，日太帝　大本營簽署實施波次坦宣言諸條件時必要之投降條件之權，凡加以保障。又天皇對於一切日本國陸海空軍官憲及處於無論同地之各該官憲所指揮一切軍隊，辦法停止戰鬥行為，移交武器，實施投降條項等最高司令官所要求之命令。日本國政府於投降後，應立即使俘虜及被拘留者移送至安全地點，俾搭載聯合國船舶，關於最後的日本國政府之形態，應依法波次坦宣言，由日本國民自由表明意思加以決定。聯合國軍隊在未完成波次坦宣言所示各項目的以前，應留駐日本國內</p>
<p>日政府八月十四日通告中。美。英。蘇四國，關於接受波次坦條項之八月十日發出之日政府通告及八月十一日美國國務　彭斯所發中。美。英，蘇四國政府回答，日政府對四國發出通告如次：</p>
<p>一，天皇已頒發關於接受波次坦宣言條項之認書。</p>
<p>二，天星準備對其政府及大本營授予實施波次坦宣言各項幾定所必要之答覆權限。又天皇準備對一切日本國陸海軍關係及在此關係指揮下之一切軍隊爲停止戰鬥行為，移交武器及實施上項各條項，頒發聯合國最高指揮官要求之一切命令。</p>

<h3>市府公佈　調整地價稅</h3>
<p>市府前以本市各區地價稅士地估値，仍係按照各區於三十三年，三十一年，甚至廿二年時所估價格　理，且有若干區地價效稅事，低於各　改征實物後每畝應征實物之折價數額，以上各情形，均與現實情况不合，經即分別加以調整，於本年一月一日起實行，所有上海特別市征收暫行地價稅章程，並經修正呈奉行政院令准備案業由市府明令公佈。</p>
<h3>本市銀錢業　業務照常進行　各業透支放款一律停止</h3>
<p>本市銀錢兩業業務，最近三數日來，情形尙稱艮好，且均於堅定準備中仍循正常途徑分謀發展。據悉各銀行錢莊收解款項，支付票據，交換轉輾人帳工作，仍照新訂辦法繼續執行外，即銀聯會錢準庫對於同業拆放業務，亦儘量接受辦理，惟對工商各業往來透士放款押　，不論有無往來，已告一律停止。此外如該兩業票據交換數字，日來已較上週減少至六分之五，其原因：　市面現錢流通額增多，各業買賣大率以現鈔為主。　市塲交易漸呈淸　，票據收付減少。　本街外埠貨銷不健，生產數量亦已激減。</p>
<h3>金劵市塲　昨交易暫停</h3>
<p>昨日金證券市塲，以近日金市暴跌，市勢不定，　戶觀望，均侍善價而活、以致開價困難，交易暫吿停頓。據悉市塲管理常局，現正　密協議，聞今日仍照常開市。</p>
<h3>各省市　郵匯照常</h3>
<p>本市郵政備金滙業局，現以各地通滙，至為重要。該局所辦理之各省市縣郵滙，決予照常維持。但如有鉅額滙款，未經該局滙兌處核定者，一律暫不滙發。</p>
<h3>通貨數字發表後　金融益見穩定　商品價格跌多漲少</h3>
<p>邇來因國際情一勞已趨明朗化，人民對於巾儲券發行流通額及準備金數量，頗寄予重視，尤其一般無知商民，自相驚擾，饗物價，無理暴漲，巾央儲備銀行為使市民明瞭中儲幣値，消除心理恐慌起見，特於日昨將中儲成立以來發行通貨總額及準備金數量公布，金融市面大為安定。除少數食用品，市價稍起高風外，其他一切商品市價，莫不漸見低落。咋日各市場及各銀行錢莊，以及公司商號一律照常開始營業，各商號過去拒絕售貨情形，均已消戢。</p>

<h3>粥少僧多分配為難　籲請各界不斷捐輸　考試成績大都優秀</h3>
<p>本報讀者助學金第九屆巾薄的新　學生，曾於木月五日假大同大學舉行甄別考試，考卷經分別批閱，即將畢事。據統計表上看來，大致都很優秀，大學取科方面，尤以理工科的學生，最為出色。中小學生亦十之七八，均在永準之上，這一點使我們大為滿憲，値得吿慰於社會熱心眆學諸公。曾有人疑惑各校學生，在戰亂中求學，所有精神的，物質的，以及心理的條件，全都使人苦悶，那學生成績的低落，自在意料之中，然而事實上倒是喜出望外，足證本報申請諸生，在校都能勤奮苦學，力求上進，而且都是各校常局愼重推薦的優秀學生，所以他們的成績，是無可　議的。</p>
<p>當前的問題，還在捐款數目的不足，也就是不能全數補助的遺憾！連日物價又漲，預料下學期學費激增，因此我們正在焦慮「粥少僧多，分配為難」。還望各界人士，趁着慶祝和平之餘，大家出其餘緒，齊心協力，慷慨捐輸，使助金增多，則事工進行，愈臻順利，為萬衆生佛，為國家備材，歌功頌德者，豈特數千子弟而已！</p>

<h3>提倡食用豆類（二）上海璽約翰大學農學院</h3>
<p>據上表所載，凡豆類合物所含之蛋白質，與牛肉牛酷相等。雞蛋中之蛋白質遠不如豆類，大豆中之蛋白質，特別應盛，為百分之三四，勝於乾牛肉百分之三〇。關於脂肪方面，花生特富，為百分之三八至四八，勝於半酪百分之三三，七，大豆之脂肪亦多，為百分之一七。多於雞蛋中所有者。至於炭水化合物，豆類中所含之百分數亦甚高，豌豆中有百分之六二，豇豆中有百分之六〇，大豆中有百分之三四。</p>
<p>旦之用途</p>
<p>古籍中廣　芳譜云：「其豆可食，可醫，司豉，可腐，荒年人所充礦，油之萍可糞地，　可燃火。華名　，嫩時可為茹」。又王禎農書：「黄豆可作豆腐，可作　料，向豆粥飯皆可拌食，白，黑，黄三豆皆濟世之殺也。昔張儀為秦連橫，說韓王曰：韓地險惡，山居五榖，所生非麥而豆，民之所食，大抵豆飯　羹」。又北齊盡庫狄伏迎傳中，有「冬至之日，親表稱賀，其妻為設豆餅」。又唐書韋言之傳中，亦有「貫之居貧，瞰豆糜自給。」</p>
<p>豆類作物，自古以來，均充作食品，方法極多，或製糕餅，或製粥飯，戚作菜蔬，或作調味油醬，或製飮料，用途極廣，歐美人稱之謂亞洲人之叭一食品也。今將豆之用途表如下列：大豆之用途　株體：一。綠肥，二。無秣（乾草保藏之秣草），三，牧草，四，燃料，五，改良土壤。</p>
<p>鬱種子：一，豆仁：甲，食物—豆飯豆粥豆糕豆粉（製麵　餅餅乾及麺用）豆腐，豆乳，豆腐乾，豆腐皮豆酪。乙，畜料，肥料。</p>
<p>二，豆油：甲，甘油，火藥，搪瓷，塗油漆，食品（人造白塔牛油代用品食油生菜油）油布，油漆，肥皂原料，橡皮代用品，印漆，燃料，潤滑用，假象牙。</p>
<p>三，產品：甲，乾豆—醬油豆湯　紅燒豆，代替品豆豉。乙，鮮豆—蔬菜罐頭食品生食。</p>
<p>栽植方法</p>
<p>古書云：「種大豆，鋤成行瓏，春穴下種，早者三四月，晚者四五月種　，地不宜肥，有草則　去，若不及時去草，必為草所　耗，雖結實亦不多。</p>
<p>動豆以九月下種，冬生嫩苗可茹，華方而肥，中空，葉狀如匙，頭圓而不尖，面綠背自，原一枝三葉，二”開花，如娥狀，紫白色，結莢述綴，蜀人收共子，備荒。」</p>
<p>大豆喜溫暖氣候，生長期間，保持攝氏十五度以上之平均溫度，未開花，雖不宜溫濕，亦須時有雨水，以助發育，開花時，天氣官乾，雨水過多，花落不實。</p>
<p>大豆不擇土壤，並有改良土壤之功用，以砂質壤土為宜，而富石灰性之鹼性士壤為尤佳，氣肥過多，結實減少，然肥料適用草木灰，因內含百分之三〇至四〇之石灰成分，小量之燐酸，及百分之五之鉀質，鉀能增大豆粒，燐能增加收獲，石灰能中和土壤，增加根瘤菌之活動。</p>
<p>在搖種之先，將地整理耘耕平坦，即可播種，時期須按各地氣侯而定，南方則春夏均司播種，惟早豆收量較少，晚豆較多，播種量每畝二升五升，播種方法大多點播，每隔一尺至一尺五寸點播一株，以棒作穴，下種時每穴二三粒，待後間拔播種，宜淺，以二寸為標準，在砂質壤土中宜略深。</p>
<p>欲大豆生長健全發育完善，必行中耕，除草鬆土最為重要，大豆下種之後，約一星期餘，即能發芽，行三次中耕，最為適當，即苗高半寸為第一次中耕，三寸高時作二次中耕，去次行之於苗高六寸左右，大豆將開花之前，中耕即須停止，否則枝條損失，即足影饗產量</p>
<p>大豆收穫因用途而異，目前農產價格高　，以收獲莢實為至要，貧葉莢變黃時即可，收割遇早子粒發氣不全，過晚則莢榖開製，子粒損失，大豆成熟，均由下部株體向上；故基部變黄色時，上部尚有綠色者。　收劇方法，或用圭刀將豆株割斷，或用手拔取堆成小束，懸於架上，待其乾燥，用速枷打落豆粒。每畝產量各地不同，普通約收豆粒七斗，華莢二担左右。</p>
<p>蠶豆適於溫和氣候，秋季播種，翌年晚春收獲，以黏性土壞為最宜。栽植方法，除行播之外，可與大小麥混合種植，播種時期約在十月間，先將種子浸水，以便發芽，蠶豆均行點播。條間二尺，株間一尺，左右每穴下稱二三粒，每畝種量八九升，因豆科作物故，氨肥不甚相宜，草木灰最為實要，並宜中耕二次，均在開花之前，收獲全依用途，種子幼嫩時，摘取可作菜蔬，老熟時用手拔取，全枝乾燥後，再行脫粒，每畝產量不一，平均以一石左右最為普通。</p>
<p>上述　豆周大豆之營養與種植之概要，凡庭園隙地，如能利用，在此米貴糧少之時，未始無補於寒苦，尚望社會人士勿輕視也。（完）</p>

<h3>Declaration</h3>
<p>"The National Government, under the leadership of Wang Jingwei, returned to Nanjing in the 29th year of the Republic [1940], declaring to the nation the two major policies of realizing peace and implementing constitutional governance. Its main purpose was, in the aftermath of national devastation, to seek national independence and freedom through peace, and to seek national construction and revitalization through constitutional governance. Since returning to the capital, all administrative construction measures, before the full realization of peace, have striven to preserve the nation's vitality, pacify the displaced people, and work tirelessly for six years. However, due to circumstances, full peace could not be achieved, and the beneficial policies could not be implemented. Every time we reflect on this, we feel a greater sense of guilt. Now that the world has returned to peace, and China and Japan have eliminated the ravages of war, although the method of peace is different from what we have always strived for, national independence and freedom are in line with what the people of the whole country hope for. We believe that the country should now return to unification, and our mission has come to an end. We hereby announce the immediate dissolution of the Nanjing National Government, in order to fulfill our long-cherished wish for unification. The Central Government Committee has been reorganized into the Nanjing Provisional Political Affairs Committee, and all duties of the National Government will be immediately transferred to the Committee for separate handling, pending conclusion. The provincial and municipal governments should continue to maintain local order, so that affairs are not interrupted, and people can feel secure. After that, they should urgently plan for the transition and gradually abolish the existing system. As for the Military Affairs Commission, it will be reorganized into the Security Committee, and its transferred troops and local forces should maintain their defensive positions to protect the people and ensure their safety. In the face of the current situation, they should especially adhere to their original defenses. If there are bandits or planes causing disturbances or attempting to sabotage unification, they should still be suppressed to eliminate the source of unrest and await reorganization for national service. It must be understood that stabilizing the localities is the foundation for national unification, and unifying the country must primarily focus on stabilizing the localities first. Our country has long suffered from upheavals, and the people have suffered deeply. The source of unrest has yet to be eradicated, and hidden worries have not been alleviated. It is hoped that all military and political leaders and the people of all regions will understand the importance of national unification and refrain from any extraneous actions, and even more so, refrain from clinging to territories, so that China can be unified as soon as possible, and the nation can be revitalized as soon as possible. This will not betray the original aspiration of the National Government to persevere and bear the burden for the past six years, nor will it betray the National Government's and the people's arduous struggle. This declaration is hereby made to inform the public."</p>

<h3>Reorganization of Puppet Currency System; Plans Nearing Completion; Prices in Chongqing Fall</h3>
<p>Central News Agency report from Chongqing: Since Japan accepted the Potsdam Declaration, the Chongqing financial market has experienced dramatic fluctuations. The price of gold has fallen to 118,000 yuan per tael, the price of US silver dollars has fallen to 18,000 yuan, and the prices of general merchandise have also plummeted by 40 to 50 percent. Dyes, fabrics, cigarettes, and miscellaneous goods have also suffered significant price drops. In contrast, export goods such as tung oil have seen prices rise due to expected overseas demand. The price of tung oil once rose to 6.8 million yuan (per 10,000 jin) and then fell to 6.2 million yuan. Among domestic products, tobacco leaves and sugar prices have also soared. According to relevant authorities, the fluctuations in the Chongqing financial market were expected, but they are only temporary. The responsible parties have already prepared plans to stabilize the national finances, reorganize the post-war currency system, and handle the puppet currency system in the occupied areas, which have been submitted to the authorities for review and implementation.</p>
<h3>Sino-Soviet Negotiations Concluded; Treaty of Friendship and Alliance Signed; Song Ziwen Leaves the Soviet Union for Washington</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Moscow, 15th: The Sino-Soviet negotiation teams have concluded, and after the new treaty was signed, the Soviet side issued the following communique today: After Chairman Stalin attended the Potsdam Conference, President of the Executive Yuan of China Song Ziwen, and Foreign Minister Wang Shijie also arrived in Moscow to continue negotiations with Chairman Stalin and Chairman Molotov of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs. The two countries signed a Treaty of Friendship and Alliance on the 14th of this month. Complete consensus has also been reached on all other issues of mutual concern. The contents of the treaty and other agreements will be announced soon after they are ratified by the heads of state of China and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Central News Agency report from Stockholm, Sweden: President of the Executive Yuan of China Song Ziwen flew from Moscow to Washington yesterday. Chairman Molotov of the Soviet People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs personally saw him off.</p>
<h3>Central Reserve Bank to Maintain Status Quo; Value of Reserve Notes to Increase; Minister Zhou Gave a Speech Yesterday</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing, 16th: Zhou Fohai, President of the Central Reserve Bank, gave the following speech regarding the Central Reserve Bank maintaining its current status and the value of Central Reserve Notes increasing: The situation has changed rapidly, and comprehensive peace has been achieved. Although there have been changes in the Nanjing Central Political Organization, the Central Reserve Bank, which is related to the people's lives and property, should maintain its current status. The value of the Central Reserve Notes it issues will not only not decrease, but will also increase. The funds borrowed from the Japanese side have already been repaid in gold, and the Central Reserve Bank has sufficient cash reserves. With the cessation of military operations, expenditures will be greatly reduced, and the amount of issuance will inevitably decrease accordingly. Furthermore, prices will gradually decline in the future, so the amount of over-issuance is unlikely to expand. The Central Reserve Notes are currently in the hands of the people and are the people's property. If their existence is denied, the loss will inevitably be borne by the people. In order to reduce the people's sacrifice, the authorities will not do this. I am currently in negotiations to ensure that the people's interests are protected. I sincerely hope that all sectors will not be misled by rumors and create unnecessary panic. This is of utmost importance.</p>

However, today, upon receiving the Imperial Rescript, we are deeply fearful of the Great Commander's concern for the battlefield and the country's future.

All our soldiers should follow the Great Commander's intentions and refrain from rash actions. This is what I am telling all the soldiers.</p>

Some bank depositors in various financial institutions made withdrawals, but the process was smooth, and the depositors did not show any signs of anxiety.</p>
<h3>Petain Sentenced to Death; Execution May Be Avoided Due to Old Age</h3>

<h3>Restoration of Peace for Japan Must Go Through Three Stages</h3>
<p>Central News Agency report: Domei News Agency, Tokyo, 16th, pointed out that although the war has now ceased, reaching the stage of complete peace will require going through three stages. First, the Japanese government must order the army and navy to cease all acts of war on a specific date and time. All battle lines in China, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific must be fully complied with, and the four countries must be notified to cease fighting. Second, a ceasefire agreement must be signed. The United States has already appointed General MacArthur as its representative, and the other three countries are expected to appoint their representatives soon. In this way, the cessation of military action will have a legal basis. Third, a truce treaty must be signed, which, based on the Potsdam Declaration, will specifically determine the handover of warships and weapons, the handling of military positions, and the issue of occupation and reparations. Only after the truce treaty is established can the state of war be completely ended. However, the conclusion of a truce treaty cannot be accomplished in a short period of time. During this period, the sovereignty of an independent country will naturally not be restored, and the people must be prepared for hardship while waiting for the conclusion of a peace treaty. Only then can Japan restore its international status and send envoys abroad.</p>
<h3>British Prime Minister's Broadcast</h3>
<p>Central News Agency report: Stockholm, Sweden: British Prime Minister Attlee broadcast at midnight on Tuesday, announcing that the United Nations had officially accepted the Japanese government's response to cease the war. At the same time, according to TASS, the Soviet government also announced its acceptance of the Japanese response to cease hostilities.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Demeanor of a Great Nation</h3>
<p>World peace is already facing us. The long-held aspirations of people around the world are about to be fully realized. No one can restrain the excitement in their hearts. However, as we said yesterday, while we are excited internally, we must remain calm externally. Only by restraining our emotions with reason can we take on the more arduous tasks of the future.</p>
<p>Why must we remain calm? It is to hope to achieve "tranquility to achieve far-reaching goals." Because although the war is over and peace has been achieved, what follows is how to maintain public security, maintain order, and ensure the smooth progress of peace work? In particular, how to intensify unity, leaving no village behind, so that the work of reconstruction and construction can be promoted in an orderly manner? These tasks are urgently needed and cannot be promoted by temporary excitement or accomplished by rash actions. Therefore, in order to jointly shoulder the successful completion of the work of peace and jointly undertake the heavy responsibility of reconstruction, everyone must work hard under the methods determined by the government and under the instructions of the government, in order to achieve the effect of division of labor and cooperation.</p>
<p>Most of the people have undergone long-term and arduous training to achieve today's peace, and the future reconstruction work is extensive and onerous. In the future, we need trained and experienced people and talents from various fields to participate in the work together. Therefore, we focus on the importance of completing future reconstruction work, and instead of passively settling scores, we should actively uphold justice, be magnanimous, set lofty goals, and call for hard work, so that those who are burdened with shame and humiliation can be inspired by justice, be grateful for the country's reports, and work hard together. We firmly believe that the conscience of patriotism will not be extinguished for long. All of them have the desire to rely on the current work of peace and the upcoming work of reconstruction.</p>
<p>I recently read the notice issued by the Political Commissioner's Office of this city, hoping that the citizens will follow the central government's intentions, maintain calmness, and earnestly maintain order. We should have the demeanor of a great nation with magnanimity and sympathy towards Japanese residents, and not treat them with disrespect. We cannot help but feel ashamed when we read the sentence "demeanor of a great nation." And we feel that this is the dawn of a clear future for Chinese politics, as we read this announcement for the first time in eight years. Because the "demeanor of a great nation" has been buried for a long time. In recent years, social phenomena in Shanghai have been full of speculation and deception, selfishness and self-interest. Once the situation changes, they immediately become emotionally agitated and express themselves in rash actions, which are far from the "demeanor of a great nation." Now, the authorities have specifically pointed out that "the demeanor of a great nation with magnanimity and sympathy should be adopted," and that Japanese residents should not be treated with disrespect, which shows that it is expected that every citizen of Shanghai can have a heart of "magnanimity and sympathy" and achieve the true demeanor of a great nation.</p>
<p>When the people have the demeanor of a great nation, the country has the demeanor of a great country. The demeanor of a great nation is based on magnanimity and sympathy, so the demeanor of a great country is undoubtedly also based on magnanimity and sympathy. The country requires the people to have the demeanor of a great nation based on magnanimity and sympathy, and at the same time, the people require the country to have the demeanor of a great country based on magnanimity and sympathy.</p>
<p>At this time of entering a new era and starting the work of rebuilding a new China, the country should have the demeanor of a great country, and the people should have the demeanor of a great nation, in order to rebuild the national morality that has fallen since the war. The only steps to practice the demeanor of a great country and a great nation are to be magnanimous and not to blame the past; to immediately abandon speculative behavior for personal gain; to look at everything from a long-term perspective and start from the near future; to obey orders and abide by order. At this critical turning point in the country's prosperity, everyone should seize the opportunity to get rid of the old and embrace the new, and strive to move forward!</p>
<p>Suburban Correspondence</p>
<h3>Current Situation in Pudong</h3>
<p>— Li Wenzhong</p>
<p>Pudong originally had the hope of flourishing, with the construction of water and electricity plants, the renovation of ferries, and the operation of large buses on Pudong Avenue. After the war, its appearance was completely changed.</p>
<p>Disorderly City Appearance: The once prosperous area of Pudong, along Laini Ferry Street and Changfan'erlixu, was filled with shops. Now, only broken tiles remain, overgrown with weeds and thorns. As a result, shops and institutions have concentrated on Dongchang Road. Last November, it was suddenly bombed, causing about two hundred casualties. Because of this, residents of Dongchang Road and nearby areas returned to their hometowns, making the city appearance even more depressed.</p>
<p>At the end of Dongchang Road, it connects to Pudong Avenue. Pudong Avenue goes north through Yangjing Town to Gaoqiao (Qingning Temple), and south to Zhoupu Town. There are privately-operated long-distance buses, with a fare of 30,000 yuan per trip, for transporting goods and merchants. Zhoupu is also a distribution center for the rice market, with bustling shops, surpassing Dongchang Road. However, gambling is rampant. Qingning Temple is the center of the secular world, where impoverished people from the suburbs of Shanghai carry burdens on their shoulders, seeking a meager profit to make a living. They are subjected to heavy exploitation along the way. Although this trend has been somewhat curbed, it has not been completely eliminated.</p>
<p>Impoverished Farmers Abound: On both sides of Pudong Avenue, fields are crisscrossed by paths, all used for cultivation. In the past, much of it was wasteland, but now that agricultural products are surprisingly expensive, farmers are competing to cultivate the land, not leaving any idle. However, due to overpopulation, owning ten acres is considered a rare and valuable thing. As a result, most of the farming is done by weak women, while men mostly seek employment in industry and commerce. The fertilization of farmland lacks any direction, planting methods are stuck in the old ways, and good harvests are left to fate. Agricultural tools are incomplete, and by-products such as livestock are not well-managed. Few people are willing to try new things. In short, most are poor farmers, but vegetables can be transported and sold in Shanghai, so production is quite high.</p>
<p>Along the banks north of Dongdao Road, there were many factories before the war, but most are now closed. Among them, Yizhong Company still manufactures cigarettes.</p>
<p>Migrant Residents Along the River: Migrant residents gather along the river, especially those from Jiangsu and Anhui, who are known for their hard work and resilience. They live in thatched huts and endure all hardships. However, education is low and superstition is rampant. Next are migrants from Ningbo, Zhejiang, who are also numerous.</p>
<p>Low Level of Culture: The customs of Pudong have always been known for their frugality and hard work. Now, with prices soaring, women and children carry rice and sell salt, working even harder. However, superstition is rampant and knowledge is low. When marrying off their children, they must have a "fortune teller" calculate their horoscopes. When someone in the family is sick, they must first pray to the gods instead of seeking medical help. Children often cause parents much worry. Residents lack grand ideas and have been ridiculed for having limited ambition, with sayings like "Their ambitions don't exceed a rice basket, and they don't travel beyond a hundred li." Perhaps this is due to the geography! As for the bustling towns, they mostly imitate the extravagance of Shanghai, and customs are also different. Education in the southern district of Pudong: due to the lack of proper school buildings, everything is makeshift. There are about a dozen private and public primary schools, and three middle schools: Zhenxin, Wudong, and Junde. There is also a normal school, and many school sites are still under preparation. It is said that private schools will have difficulty maintaining themselves next semester, which is a major blow to the educational circles of Pudong. It is hoped that the Bureau of Education will provide assistance.</p>
<p>Superstition is Rampant: In terms of religion, most people believe in Buddhism. Zhangjialou is mostly Christian. In recent years, there is also "Yiguan Dao" (Unity Sect), which is rapidly gaining popularity (also known as Chonghua Hall), meaning that all religions are united, incorporating the teachings of Confucius and Mencius. They also set up altars, using gods and Buddhas as an excuse. Believers are divided into male "Qian Dao" and female "Kun Dao". Each church enshrines complex and confusing images of Guanyin, Jigong, and Maitreya, making it difficult to know which to follow. They call the leader "Dian Chanshi" (Enlightened Master). Each major town has churches, which also provide free medical services. However, because it does not shed its superstitious nature, it is ridiculed by those with biased views, who are mistaken for knowledgeable. However, they have no known rebellious actions. It is assumed that whenever the situation is unstable, and people suffer both mentally and physically, they hear of empty and illusory claims and believe that they can resolve all "demonic tribulations", and blindly follow them!</p>

<p>Application by the Japanese Government to Accept the Potsdam Declaration: The government of the Japanese Empire, in order to promote world peace and eliminate the suffering caused to mankind by the continuation of the war, and wishing to end the fighting as soon as possible, at the behest of His Majesty the Emperor, requested the Soviet Union government, which maintained neutral relations at the time, to restore peace several weeks ago. Unfortunately, this effort did not succeed. Now, based on His Majesty the Emperor's desire to overcome the general hope for peace, and striving to end the war as quickly as possible, we have decided to accept the conditions of the joint declaration issued by the heads of government of China, the United States, and the United Kingdom in Potsdam on July 26, 1945 (later joined by the Soviet Union). However, please understand that this does not include the requirement to change the Emperor's authority to rule the nation. The Imperial Government firmly believes that the above understanding is correct and hopes for a prompt indication of a clear intention regarding this condition.</p>
<p>The United States government, representing the Republic of China, the United States of America, the United Kingdom, and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, has received the Japanese government's reply requesting acceptance of the conditions of the Potsdam Declaration, stating that the understanding does not include the requirement to change the Emperor's authority to rule the nation. Regarding the Japanese government's note, our position is as follows:</p>
<p>From the time of surrender, the Emperor and the Japanese government's authority over the nation should be placed under the limitations necessary for the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces to implement the terms of surrender. The Emperor shall be given the authority to guarantee to the Japanese government, the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters, the necessary surrender conditions for signing and implementing the terms of the Potsdam Declaration. In addition, the Emperor shall issue orders required by the Supreme Commander to all officers and authorities of the Japanese land, sea, and air forces, and to all troops under the command of these officers, regardless of location, to cease hostilities, hand over weapons, and implement the terms of surrender. After the surrender, the Japanese government shall immediately transfer prisoners of war and detainees to safe locations for embarkation on Allied ships. Regarding the final form of the Japanese government, it shall be decided by the Japanese people freely expressing their will in accordance with the Potsdam Declaration. Allied forces shall remain in Japan until the completion of the objectives set forth in the Potsdam Declaration.</p>
<p>Notification from the Japanese Government to China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union on August 14th, regarding the notification issued by the Japanese government on August 10th concerning the acceptance of the Potsdam terms and the response of the governments of China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union issued by US Secretary of State Byrnes on August 11th. The Japanese government has issued the following notification to the four nations:</p>
<p>1. The Emperor has issued a decree regarding the acceptance of the terms of the Potsdam Declaration.</p>
<p>2. The Emperor is prepared to grant the necessary authority to his government and the General Headquarters to implement all decisions regarding the Potsdam Declaration. In addition, the Emperor is prepared to issue all orders requested by the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces to all Japanese land and sea forces and all troops under their command to cease hostilities, hand over weapons, and implement the above terms.</p>

Liu Junqing and Zhang Zuoxing will fill the vacancies.</p>
<h3>All Lines of Central China Railway Trains Run as Usual Director Zheng Orders Subordinates to Diligently Perform Their Duties</h3>
<p>Rumors that all lines of the Central China Railway Company have stopped running are inaccurate. All trains are running as usual and will not stop. Director Zheng of China Railway also gave instructions to his staff yesterday. The original text of the instructions is as follows:</p>
<p>"Now that the dawn of world peace has emerged, it is fortunate for mankind. We are engaged in railways and have always worked diligently for railways. Standing at our posts, we will not get involved in other matters. At this time of transition, all colleagues on the entire line should especially demonstrate the railway spirit, not allowing transportation to be interrupted for even a day, and strive to preserve this large part of the industry and prevent damage. When the National Army arrives, we must fully prepare vehicles and await dispatch, without delay. Our Chinese colleagues should especially unanimously take responsibility, not leaving their posts without authorization, and await government orders. We must treat our Japanese colleagues sincerely, work together, and get through this difficult time. I cannot express enough the importance of this. This order is hereby issued to all colleagues on the entire line for their information and compliance, without violation." Furthermore, the company is printing the instructions in large-sized paper and plans to post them along the entire Central China Railway line to warn Chinese employees.</p>
<h3>North China Gives Priority to the Transportation of Essential Living Materials</h3>
<p>According to the Allied News Agency in Beiping: The North China Railway Company announced at 12:00 noon on August 16th that the transportation of essential living materials such as rice, cooking oil, firewood, etc., will be implemented in accordance with the following items: Essential living materials have priority in using the railway.

All transportation restrictions are abolished, and the restrictions on removers and collectors are lifted. Restrictions on passengers carrying luggage in passenger cars are lifted. The above materials will not be subject to any restrictions after arrival.</p>
<h3>Ferry Fares, Vehicle Rental, and Car Prices Adjusted Yesterday</h3>
<p>Regarding the ferry fares across the Huangpu River, rickshaws, tricycles, automobiles, East rentals, and car prices, they have been separately approved as follows: The Huangpu River ferry fare is adjusted to 700 yuan per person. The daily rental of rickshaws is adjusted to 8,000 yuan. The fare for tricycles is 5,000 yuan per half hour. The ratio between double-seat and single-seat is still calculated at 3 to 2 (i.e., 3,400 yuan per half hour for single-seat). The car rental for automobiles is 60,000 yuan per 20 minutes. If there are any cases of overcharging or extortion, the Construction Bureau will conduct secret investigations with the Police Bureau at any time and impose severe punishments. It is also heard that the city government's organization of the rickshaw industry association is slow and almost at a standstill. Due to the arrest of the leaders, the industry is divided, and recently, a few members have been making unauthorized cloths, which is inappropriate. The city government ordered the Economic Bureau to work with the Police Construction Bureau to quickly supervise the reorganization of the industry association, thoroughly consolidate it, so that it can implement management and assist the authorities.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Government Announces the Adjustment of Land Price Tax</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government previously stated that the land valuation for land price tax in various districts of the city was still handled according to the prices estimated in the 33rd, 31st, or even 22nd year of the Republic of China. In addition, the land price tax in some districts was lower than the converted amount of real objects that should be collected per acre after the change of collecting real objects in various districts. The above situations are inconsistent with the current situation. After immediate adjustments, they will be implemented from January 1st of this year. All regulations on the collection of temporary land price tax in Shanghai Special Municipality have been revised and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval, and the case has been announced by the Municipal Government.</p>

However, all overdrafts, loans, and mortgages to industrial and commercial enterprises, regardless of whether there is past business, have been suspended. In addition, the number of bill exchanges in the two industries has decreased to five-sixths compared to last week, for the following reasons: There is more cash in circulation in the market, and most transactions in various industries are mainly in cash. Market transactions are gradually becoming clear, and bill payments are decreasing. Sales of goods from this street to other cities are not healthy, and production has also decreased sharply.</p>
<h3>Gold Market Trading Suspended Yesterday</h3>
<p>The gold and securities market was temporarily suspended yesterday because the recent gold market has plummeted, the market situation is uncertain, and investors are waiting and watching, all waiting for good prices to become active, resulting in difficulty in opening prices. It is reported that the Market Management Board is currently discussing in secret. It is heard that the market will open as usual today.</p>
<h3>Postal Remittances to Various Provinces and Cities Continue as Usual</h3>
<p>The postal remittance bureau in this city now considers the remittance of funds to various places to be very important. The postal remittances to various provinces, cities, and counties handled by the bureau will continue to be maintained as usual. However, if there are large remittances that have not been approved by the bureau's remittance department, they will not be remitted for the time being.</p>

<h3>Few Porridge and Many Monks Difficult Distribution Appeal to All Sectors to Continuously Donate Exam Results Are Mostly Excellent</h3>
<p>The ninth session of new and impoverished students of the This Newspaper Readers' Scholarship Fund held a screening exam at Datong University on the 5th of this month. The exam papers have been reviewed and are about to be completed. According to the statistics, they are generally excellent. In terms of university enrollment, students majoring in science and engineering are the most outstanding. Among primary and secondary school students, seven or eight out of ten are above the standard. This makes us very satisfied and is worth comforting to the public who are enthusiastic about learning in society. Some people have doubted that students in various schools are studying in the midst of war, and all mental, material, and psychological conditions make people depressed. The decline in student performance is expected. However, in fact, it is a pleasant surprise, which proves that the students applying for the This Newspaper are able to study diligently and strive for progress in school, and they are all excellent students carefully recommended by the school authorities. Therefore, their achievements are beyond doubt.</p>
<p>The current problem is still the lack of donations, which is the regret that not all students can be subsidized! Prices have risen again in recent days, and tuition fees are expected to increase sharply next semester. Therefore, we are worried about "few porridge and many monks, difficult distribution". We also hope that people from all walks of life will take advantage of the celebration of peace, everyone will give their surplus, work together, and donate generously, so that the scholarship fund will increase, and the work will proceed more smoothly. The merit of saving all living beings and preparing talents for the country is not limited to thousands of children!</p>

<h3>Promoting the Consumption of Beans (2) Shanghai University of John College of Agriculture</h3>
<p>According to the above table, the protein contained in all bean products is equivalent to that of beef and milk. The protein in eggs is far less than that of beans. The protein in soybeans is particularly abundant, accounting for 34%, which is more than the 30% in dried beef. Regarding fat, peanuts are especially rich, accounting for 38% to 48%, which is more than the 33.7% in butter. Soybeans are also rich in fat, accounting for 17%, which is more than that contained in eggs. As for carbohydrates, the percentage contained in beans is also very high. Peas contain 62%, cowpeas contain 60%, and soybeans contain 34%.</p>
<p>Uses of Beans</p>
<p>Ancient books extensively record. "Fang Pu" states: "Beans can be eaten, used for medicine, made into fermented soybeans, made into tofu. In famine years, people use them to fill their stomachs, and the waste from oil extraction can be used to fertilize the land and burned for fuel. The flower is called, when tender, it can be eaten as a vegetable." Also, Wang Zhen's "Agricultural Treatise" states: "Yellow beans can be made into tofu, can be used as sauce ingredients, soybean porridge and rice can all be mixed with food. White, black, and yellow beans are all saviors of the world. In the past, Zhang Yi, to unite the states for Qin, said to the King of Han: The land of Han is dangerous, the people live in the mountains and grow five grains, but what grows is not wheat but beans. What the people eat is mostly bean rice and bean soup." Also, in the biography of Ku Di Fu Ying in the Northern Qi Dynasty, there is mention of "On the day of the winter solstice, relatives and friends congratulate each other, and his wife prepares bean cakes." Also, in the biography of Wei Yan Zhi in the Tang Dynasty, there is also mention of "Guan Zhi lived in poverty, relying on bean porridge for sustenance."</p>
<p>Bean crops have been used as food since ancient times, and there are many ways to prepare them. They can be made into cakes and pastries, porridge and rice, cooked as vegetables, made into seasoning oils and sauces, or made into beverages. The uses are extremely wide. Europeans and Americans call them the staple food of Asians. Now, a table of the uses of beans is listed below: Uses of Soybeans Plant: 1. Green manure, 2. Animal feed (preserved dry grass), 3. Pasture, 4. Fuel, 5. Improve soil.</p>
<p>Seeds: 1. Soybean kernels: A. Food—bean rice, bean porridge, bean cakes, bean flour (used for making noodles, flatbread, biscuits, and noodles), tofu, soy milk, dried tofu, tofu skin, soy yogurt. B. Animal feed, fertilizer.</p>
<p>2. Soybean oil: A. Glycerin, gunpowder, enamel, paint, food (artificial butter substitute, cooking oil, salad oil), oilcloth, paint, soap raw materials, rubber substitutes, printing ink, fuel, lubricant, artificial ivory.</p>
<p>3. Products: A. Dried beans—soy sauce, bean soup, braised beans, substitute for fermented black soybeans. B. Fresh beans—vegetables, canned food, eaten raw.</p>
<p>Planting Methods</p>
<p>Ancient books state: "To plant soybeans, plow into rows and mounds, plant in spring, early in the third or fourth month, later in the fourth or fifth month. The soil should not be too fertile. If there are weeds, remove them. If weeds are not removed in time, they will consume the nutrients, and even if they bear fruit, it will not be much.</p>
<p>Winter soybeans are planted in the ninth month. The young seedlings that grow in winter can be eaten. The leaves are square and fat, hollow inside, and the shape of the leaves is like a spoon, round and not pointed, green on the front and white on the back. Originally, one stem has three leaves. In the second year, they bloom with moth-like, purple-white flowers and bear pods that hang down. The people of Shu harvest the seeds to prepare for famine."</p>
<p>Soybeans prefer a warm climate. During the growing period, maintain an average temperature above 15 degrees Celsius. Before flowering, although not suitable for warm and humid conditions, there must be occasional rain to help development. When flowering, the weather should be dry. Too much rain will cause the flowers to fall and not bear fruit.</p>
<p>Soybeans do not discriminate against soil and have the effect of improving the soil. Sandy loam is suitable, and alkaline soil rich in lime is even better. Too much fertilizer will reduce fruiting. However, fertilizer is suitable for plant ash because it contains 30% to 40% lime, a small amount of phosphate, and 5% potassium. Potassium can increase the size of the soybean grains, phosphorus can increase the harvest, and lime can neutralize the soil and increase the activity of rhizobia.</p>
<p>Before sowing, the land should be prepared, plowed, and leveled before sowing. The timing must be determined according to the local climate. In the south, sowing can be done in both spring and summer, but the early beans yield less, while the late beans yield more. The amount of seed sown is two to five liters per mu. The sowing method is mostly spot sowing, planting one plant every foot to one foot and a half. Use a stick to make a hole, and put two or three seeds in each hole when sowing. Wait until later to thin them out. Sowing should be shallow, with two inches as the standard, and slightly deeper in sandy loam.</p>
<p>To ensure that soybeans grow healthily and develop perfectly, it is essential to cultivate, remove weeds, and loosen the soil. After sowing soybeans, they can germinate in about a week or so. It is most appropriate to cultivate three times, that is, the first cultivation when the seedlings are half an inch high, the second cultivation when they are three inches high, and the third cultivation when they are about six inches high. Cultivation must be stopped before the soybeans are about to bloom, otherwise the loss of branches will affect the yield.</p>
<p>The soybean harvest varies depending on the use. Currently, agricultural product prices are high, so harvesting pods and seeds is most important. When the lower leaves and pods turn yellow, they can be harvested. Harvesting too early will result in incomplete grain development, and too late will cause the pods to crack and the grains to be lost. Soybeans mature from the bottom of the plant upwards, so when the base turns yellow, the upper part is still green. The harvesting method is to cut off the soybean plants with a sickle or pull them out by hand and pile them into small bundles, which are hung on a rack to dry. Then use a flail to beat off the soybean grains. The yield per mu varies from place to place, but normally it yields about seven dou of soybean grains and about two dan of pods.</p>
<p>Broad beans are suitable for mild climates. They are sown in autumn and harvested in late spring of the following year. Clay soil is most suitable. In addition to row sowing, they can be mixed with wheat and barley. The sowing time is around October. First, soak the seeds in water to facilitate germination. Broad beans are all spot sown. The row spacing is two feet, and the plant spacing is one foot. About two or three seeds are sown in each hole. The amount of seed sown per mu is eight to nine liters. Because they are leguminous crops, ammonium fertilizers are not very suitable. Plant ash is most important, and it is advisable to cultivate twice, both before flowering. The harvest depends entirely on the use. When the seeds are young and tender, they can be picked and used as vegetables. When they are old and mature, they are pulled out by hand. After the whole branch is dry, the grains are threshed. The yield per mu varies, but on average, one shi is most common.</p>
<p>The above is a general overview of the nutrition and planting of soybeans and broad beans. If even small gardens can be utilized, in this time of expensive rice and scarce grain, it may be of some help to the poor and cold. It is hoped that people in society will not underestimate it.
