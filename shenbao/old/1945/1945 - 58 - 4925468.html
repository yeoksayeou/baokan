<h3>硫黃島戰鬥益烈　日軍挺身隊活躍　守備隊確何陣地勇猛反祭擊</h3>
<p>東京二十六日中央社電　敵美於硫黃島登陸以來，已歷一週，戰况益趨激烈，二十四日繼續激戰，作戰重心在屏風岩至元山機塲南側地區，第二激戰區域在西都正面之阿蘇台南側地帶，敵始終對該島中央部攻擊，經日軍主要陣地猛加反攻後，敵之損害益見慘重。</p>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　於硫黃島各戰綫活躍之日軍挺身攻擊隊到處潛入敵陣列深處，奮勇殺敵，並炸毀其資材。二十一日夜該島山田朧指揮之挺身突擊隊，自西海岸前進奇製千島附近之敵軍指揮所，殺傷敵兵甚多，截獲指揮所內之作戰要圖，該作戰要圖載敵軍戰鬥配備狀况極爲明細。</p>
<p>東京二十六日中央社電　硫黃島日軍守備部隊，刻依然據守天險確保主要陣地，猛烈反攻敵軍，予以重創。二十三日以來，敵軍攻擊重點，即轉向屏風岩及地熱原方面，企圖侵入日軍主要陣地之中央部，日軍守備部隊，亦於敵軍反攻重點增强兵力，施以猛攻，悉將敵軍企圖粉碎。二十三日以來，該島之戰綫已固定，於日軍之陣地前綫敵軍，二十五日下午七時許，企圖由島西部正面侵入阿蘇台方面，日軍守備隊當即邀擊，展開激戰，南部正面之敵軍，亦於上午七時，以二百之兵力，於該地附近結集戰車進行攻擊，並以一部兵力，進攻地熱原方面，對此，日軍砲兵部隊乃猛加砲擊。二十五日上午九時半，敵軍第一綫，爲自阿蘇台，千島部落，地熱原及屏風岩間結成之綫，敵軍重點，似向中央，以戰車八十輛自地熱原附近向元山機塲企圖頭强進攻，然摺鉢山方面陷於孤立之日軍，仍繼續奮戰，二十三日夜，曾敢行大規模之肉搏突擊，衝入戰車羣中，擊毀其戰車多輛，二十四日以後，依然可見日軍旗飄揚於摺鉢山山頂。</p>
<p>摺鉢山遭砲擊彈痕幾如蜂窠</p>
<p>中央社訊　據二十四日紐約消息，美合衆社從軍記者報吿硫黃島作戰之困難如次：美海軍陸戰隊攻擊硫黃島，戰事之遲遲不進情形，殊堪悲觀，現在與余在海濱之兵士，均認今後作戰爲太平洋作戰中最困難者，硫黃島之面樍極少，因此作戰極爲困難，不能進行巧妙戰術。余今晨曾目睹美海軍陸戰隊攻擊摺鉢山之凄慘情形，該山高約五百五十英尺，因受猛烈轟炸砲擊，全山砲痕累累，幾如蜂巢，日軍裝設日砲，大砲之山洞與隧道，大部分已被擊破，然日軍抵抗堅强，對於海濱美軍船一隻補給基地及兵員加以猛轟，日軍砲擊雖一時減少，然至今日又呈活潑，日軍防禦設備更爲强固，非加以三四發命中彈不能使其失效。島上到處有日兵潛伏，甚至出現於已被美軍佔領之元山飛機塲，所以吾人愈接近東京，其作戰愈爲困難，美軍艦之砲擊頗有傷害島上美軍之可能，因此戰鬥必須變爲步兵戰，而軍艦大砲則已失其效力。</p>
<h3>日軍使用　火箭砲彈</h3>
<p>里斯本二十六日中央社電　日軍於硫黃島使用之重磅火箭砲彈，乃直接應用於前綫發射器，與德國於後方發射之V1流星彈性質逈異。其對於戰局之影響殊爲重大。敵軍陣地接到此項消息後，頗感驚恐，據合衆社特派員郞茲巴克報道美軍砲術專門家對此新武器之意見，認爲日軍新武器四日前曾在硫黃島東南方美海兵隊登陸地點炸裂，其發射地點大的在掩護射擊陣地之北方山地，此種新武器之出現，乃硫黃島有最大防備之明證。該砲彈發射時，利用噴射推進力，飛翔於空中，一俟擊中目標，藉彈火信管之作用而炸裂，此外日軍尙使用普通之火箭砲，對地對空兩用砲，日砲，自動步槍等武器</p>
<h3>美擬侵佔　渝航空事業</h3>
<p>據確息：渝航空啓署長毛邦初去秋赴美，參加支加哥航空會議，頃巳回返重慶，本月二十二日曾發表談話稱：將來國際間之航空，雖恢復自由競爭制，但中國民間航空方面仍可發展，不致遭曼礙云云。按毛之所以發表此談話者，實緣英美於此航空會議中，曾有秘密諒解，英承認美國可以把握渝方之航空事業，因之毛乃有此聲明，以爲掩飾。美國將來並擬把握全世界之航空網，故於各汽油生產地區伊朗。伊拉克甚至中國內地之煤油生產狀况，大爲注意，實爲將來攫取國際航空網之張本也。</p>
<h3>日首相談話</h3>
<p>東京二十六日中央社電　小磯首相二十五日夜自宮中退出後，發表談話如次：二十五日來襲東京之敵機，竟敢轟炸宮內省主馬寮及大宮御所守衛所，被害固極微小，爲臣子者實恐懼不知所措，余立即晋宮恭請聖安，並趨御所恭請皇太后聖安。明晨當晋謁天皇陛下，代表閣僚謹致罪忱，余與一億同胞共憤敵機之不遜行爲，誓死擊減敵美。</p>
<h3>梧洲漸趨繁榮　桂平設督辦公署</h3>
<p>梧州二十六日中央社電　廣西梧州自去歲九月下旬陷落後，迄今五月，市面恢復戰前之繁榮，戰前梧州人口約十五六萬人，現歸返者已達十萬人，梧州位於華南沿岸至內地之交通中心，其西江流域爲物質之集散地，物資之上市隨治安之回復而增多，各種輕工業及家庭手工業逐漸開始工作。戰前皮革工塲四十二所，復業者三十二所，其他輾米廠醬園電綫等小規模工商業，亦全部復業，在政治上創設有指導民衆之民治部。同時日商正金台灣等銀行相繼設立分行，對金融上之協助甚多，梧州南部之戰墟，民衆自動獻金三百五十萬元。梧州上流之要衝桂平，民衆復歸者約四萬人，現已設立桂平地區督辦公署，一日由西南派元老李濟琛氏之胞弟李紹昌氏就任督辦，從事一切復興計劃。</p>
<h3>伊洛瓦底江畔　日空軍夜襲　炸毀壞敵車及渡河設施</h3>
<p>緬甸前綫基地二十六日中央社電　日航空部隊協力北上作戰，攻擊伊洛瓦底江畔之敵軍，二十四日以戰鬥機隊對敵汽車部隊猛襲，三輛起火焚燒，並擊破其四十八輛。又該夜出動轟炸機編隊，攻擊尼安克（巴考克西南二十八里），炸毀其渡河設施四處內一處大火災），予以甚大損害，日機則安然飛返。</p>
<h3>馬尼刺戰爭　移市街周邊　日軍到處作突擊處進攻</h3>
<p>呂宋前綫二十六日中央社電　日軍有力部隊，十四日自馬尼刺東北衝擊馬尼刺附近敵美大軍之側背，其後到處反覆作突擊進攻，蹂躪敵軍之增援部隊輸送部隊，或炸破其物資，堅如旋風般繼續前進，一部已迫近馬羅羅斯南方馬尼刺沿岸，切斷敵補給錢。另一隊迫近馬尼刺市，與舊馬吉列全營之海軍部隊合師，加其轉進始終積極果敢攻擊，獲極大戰果，同時貢獻於馬尼刺守備隊諸，亦頗爲不少，達成目的後，又以果敢神速之行動，回歸原陣。敵以集中於馬尼刺市外之全力，企圖向馬尼刺東方山地之日軍據點進攻，其行動逐漸活潑，其一部以舟艇溯行於伯西古河，開始在馬尼刺東南拉古邦湖南力上陸。另一部亦於是日使戰車十輛爲先鋒，出現於馬尼刺東方十五公里之馬里芝那機塲東方高地附近，馬尼刺東南方十五公里之伯西與馬里芝那問之戰塲，羅沙留附近，擁有十五糎榴彈砲及多數戰車之敵，正在行動中。馬尼刺東北十公里之諾巴里基南方面，敵軍行動亦見積極，同時北部戰綫無大變化，聖列哥拉斯方面，二十二日拂曉開始激戰，呂宋東方高地並有砲四十門之兩營敵軍，向日軍據點進壞，戰事現已自馬尼刺市街移向市街周邊，自呂宋中部之平原低地，移向其周邊之山陵地帶。</p>
<h3>滬蘇間之內河航運</h3>
<p>— 文祥</p>
<p>此次筆者學校放假，本擬乘火車回鄕，後因火車票難買，又不便携帶行李，凑巧家鄕來了一隻花生船，於是順便搭了空船回去。在船上住了三日四夜，一路上所見的形形色色，恐怕很少有人知道，爰述於後，以供一般回鄕者之參考。</p>
<p>碼頭一瞥</p>
<p>船停在豐（田紗廠旁之中山橋堍，當日共有大小船隻百餘艘，中以空船居多，都是從內地裝了貨物如樹柴，黃豆，花生等來滬，卸撞後預備等輪船拖回去的。在周家橋的一家玉與園茶館裏，擠滿了形形色色上中下三等的人物，船老闆，掮客，船伙計，流氓，黃衣裳，一天到晚熈熈攘攘鬧得烏烟瘴氣，忙的不外是報關，講斤頭，買輪船票。聽說貨船到了碼頭，非在這裏講好條件方准許報關。開船了，先由空船排成數列，用繩索相互穿貫，然後一排排接上去，總計有四十艘之多，都是能裝三四百担黃豆的大船，拖輪名叫瑞慶號。在這一剎那間，船夫的叫囂，船老闆的呼喝，一片「倒　」之聲不絕，比乘火車還要緊張許多，從上午十時站在龍頭上，枵腹以待，直到下午三時方始正式駛離上海。</p>
<p>經過黃渡</p>
<p>雖然祇有五十里短短的路程，可是輪船拖了一十七個鐘點，據船家說，還算很快，這是困爲河狹水淺，水道迂迴曲折，拖了四十艘大船，速度一快，就有擱淺危險。船出野雞墩，離上海不過十餘里，天色已晚，乃在北新涇宿夜，翌晨　續開行，下午六時方抵小黃渡。</p>
<p>次日，船過大黃渡，河進驟寬，加之水勢又大，船乃成雙而行，又一日夜始抵蘇州寳帶橋，行程一百六十華里，每時航速不過六七里而已。自寳帶橋起，輪船解纜而去，各船乃不得不撑篙而行。</p>
<p>沿途勒索</p>
<p>從上海到蘇州，一張輪船票要買一萬三千元。不料才出上海，即有一小船挨船勒索，每船五百元一千元不等。從上海至黃渡，途經北新涇，野鷄墩，周王廟，眞可謂關卡林立，封鎖重重，二人一組，三人一羣，花樣百出，一律須得開鎖，據說這是「規矩」，靠山吃山，靠水吃水，總計連輪船上的開銷在內，一隻空船要耗去一萬五汗金。聽船老闆說，不得不如此，還是合算的，假使一隻船獨行，開銷還要大，並且還有危險。</p>
<p>開船時船老闆預先知照搭客，到封鎖錢切勿外出，以免麻煩，所以差不多三天完全墊伏艙中。船上一天三餐，無非鹹菜，刻苦可想而知。晚間朔風貶骨，瑟縮不能入睡，加之白日裏又不得抬頭立直，是故搭船諸人，無不叫苦連天。</p>
<p>疏散工具</p>
<p>目下行路之難，擬於登天，假使帶了家眷什物，簡直不可思議。火車高喊改善，可是終難合於理想，輪船容積又小，倒不如利用民船。一則可裝載笨重什物，二則合家同行，照顧方便，損失較少，如上海實行大規模疏散，最爲簡便經濟，如學校·團體，慈善機關等等，利用回程空船，船主自亦樂予接受，一舉二便，又不致受外來一切影響，如燃料缺乏等等。其辦法可先由同鄕會至碼頭調查家鄕來滬船只舉行登記，一面又先期登記回鄕同鄕，沿途再派軍停護送，並由市府給予證明文件，以免途中敵詐，如是可謂萬無一失。</p>
<p>蘇州鄉間</p>
<p>船至實帶橋，聞蘇州城內有封空船風聲，故大小船隻，無不趨避鄕村河浜，　者所乘之船，本擬直駛常州，於是亦繞城而行，至晚宿於離黃塘鎭六里之新國里朱家村，是地離城八九里，近木凟靈巖山，地處荒僻，初甚恐懼，後經詢諸鄉人，曰此地從無匪類騷擾，余等始安然入睡。翌晨呼一鄉人荷物先導，詢知此地鄉民異常淳樸，絕無不良份子，鄕民見余服學生裝，亦無驚異之色。常地物價甚賤，一壺茶祗二十元，米價二萬五千元，柴千元一擔，眞可謂世外桃源矣。</p>
<h3>美機千八百架　襲德工業區　慕尼黑被炸尤烈</h3>
<p>瑞典京城二十六日中央社電　據倫敦電：美轟炸機一千一百架，及直衛戰鬥機七百架編成之大編隊，二十五日轟炸慕尼黑及魯爾區鐵路飛機塲軍需工業等，特別對慕尼黑加以五百架以上轟炸機之集中攻擊。</p>
<h3>布萊斯勞　展開市街戰</h3>
<p>柏林二十六日中央社電　據前綫消息：尼芝河戰綫之作戰主動權，已歸於德軍之手，德軍已掃蕩敵軍橋頭堡數處，又古本橋頭堡之德軍，依然抵抗蘇軍攻勢。</p>
<p>蘇黎世二十六日中央社電蘇軍左翼依然於哥里茲區繼續其執抝之突破企圖。沃特河至尼芝河間，乃東綫之主要戰塲，圍繞布萊斯勞都市要塞之攻防戰，已更趨熾烈，制壓該市外圍之蘇軍，似已由南方開始，在市中心決意死守要塞之十萬德軍，以迫繫砲及機關槍展開市街戰。東普魯士之康尼斯堡陷於重圍之德軍，由於數日來果敢攻擊，終於確保該市與港外之聯絡。</p>
<h3>德軍炸毀水閘　魯淾河泛濫杜倫育利許巷戰激烈</h3>
<p>柏林二十六日中央社電　海通社訊：德軍又炸毀魯爾水閘之鐵管一條，因之魯爾河水勢又復上漲，其南之戰區悉遭水淹，料蒙高茂萊元帥部下之敵軍作戰必甚困難。</p>
<p>柏林二十六日中央社電　魯爾河兩側，敵軍增援不巳，戰况劇烈。敵工兵力圖建立橋頭堡，遭德軍砲火之痛擊，杜倫及育利許（Juelich）巷戰未已，美第一第九軍至今未在魯爾河彼岸，建立較大橋頭堡，故敵軍坦克部隊尙未能發揮其力量，因之魯爾河之戰，猶不得謂已過第一期。繆斯與萊因河下遊間，加拿大第一軍繼續於哥許·韋茲公路上衝擊，十五日以來美加軍士之死傷已在萬名以上。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>救濟失業問題</h3>
<p>最近中樞爲實行簡政，訂定原則及辦法，本市當局也實行整飭內部，以縮小機構使之簡單化，裁汰冗員提高工作效率爲整飭重點。這是政府機關方面的裁員趨勢。同時，本市工業界因爲電力與原料的限制，生產減少。商業界因爲物價高漲，一般購買力減低，營業淸淡。而工商各業都因物價高漲，顧到維持職工生計，又須提高待遇。因此，爲適應環境，平衡收支，也須實行裁員節流，這是工商各界的裁員趨勢。</p>
<p>不論政府機關或是工商各業，在目前狀况下，爲健全本身，裁員節流，巳爲不可避免的情勢。而山於裁員的結果，就產生了失業問題，被裁人員，都成了失業份子。更因爲整個社會都有裁員節流的趨勢，所以，失業份子的數量必然可觀。而這些失業者不是公務人員，就是工商職工，都是所謂薪水階級。薪水階級在這幾年的生活中，受到高物價的威脅，莫不感覺生計困難。不過，尙有一官半職，薪水所入，稍資挹注。如果失業以後，僅此微薄的薪水，也不可得，而物價更高，生活更難。我們試想，這種恐慌，將是怎樣的嚴重呢！</p>
<p>鑒於上述的情勢，對於面臨的失業問題，我們不能不加以嚴切注意。失業問題是整個社會問題中的一端，自應山政府與社會共同的力量負起救濟責任，我們率先提供管見，以供硏討：</p>
<p>（一）政府機關與工商各業，對於被裁人員，應儘最大可能給予解職救濟金，俾使生活不致立刻發生影響。</p>
<p>（二）政府機關被裁職工，應給予服務證明書，在內地機關需要工作人員時，得儘先量才錄用。工商業對於解雇職工，給予證件，俾復業或需要時儘先復職。當然，對於品性不良，工作不力者自在例外。</p>
<p>（三）社會福利局會同民間社會福利社會服務團體商討組織失業人員登記處，對於失業者之擅長技能予以登記，分類彙編，遇機介紹。並與內地機關及公會商會等取得聯絡，推荐專才。</p>
<p>（四）目前正在辦理疏散人口，失業者自亦在疏散之列。就失業者本身設想，自以疏散離滬爲上策。有家可歸者，各歸本籍比較簡單，無家可歸者，應即加入疏散委員會指定地點。惟最須注意的，放棄階級觀念，譬如原以揑筆桿爲職業的，疏散以後並不需要揑筆桿，而須揑鋤犂時，應即卸却長衫接受時代環境的所賦。</p>
<p>諺云：「凡事豫則立」。失業問題已經是不可避免的趨勢，希望當局曁社會領袖共起注意，乘此疏散人口實施之際，同時顧到失業救濟，俾使失業者有所安排，而社會秩序得保安寗。</p>
<h3>趙宣傳部長　談宣傳施案　指導工作正在計劃中</h3>
<p>南京二十六日中央社電宣傳部趙部長蒞任以來，對於決戰下之國府宣傳體制，詳爲擘劃，刻正逐步予以實施中。記者昨特晋謁趙部長，叩詢關於目前之宣傳施策各問題，承答復如下：</p>
<p>（問）部長就任後，關於宣政要點，我人已從歷次談話中窺其大要，惟關於具體的推進方針尙未見發表，例如宣傳機構，中央方面宣傳部之四司組織，以及對於決戰時期之今日是否有改革之必要？又現在上海。漢口等地均有戰時宣傳機關之成立，而由盟邦宣傳機關加入，以强化力量，此項組織首都是否亦屬必要？又各省市之宣傳機構，現在特別市及蘇北尙有宣傳處之存在，省府方面則祇設科，似嫌發展不平衡，且中央與地方之宣政似有一元化之必要，對此部長高見如何？</p>
<p>宣部機構暫無變更</p>
<p>（答）本部機構暫無變更，戰時宣傳新機關設立與吾，須俟中樞之指示。至與盟邦宣傳機關向有密切之聯絡，固屬不成問題，各省裁宣傳處設科，爲省政改革機構案之一目，將來中樞如對各特別市及蘇北之行政機構有所改革時，則本問題當可提請硏究。</p>
<p>（問）國府之新聞政策早有決定，最近新聞協會成立，宣部對於各地報紙未知有如何之刷新計劃，主要報紙之合併，白報紙之重點配給，及人士調整有吾考慮及之？又過去宣部對於特別新聞例有宣傳要點之頒發，效力頗大，惟此乃臨時的措置，平時之宣傳指導似亦甚重要。關於此點，未識有吾考慮及之。</p>
<p>宣傳要點隨時頒發</p>
<p>（答）本部對各地報紙採取健進行之方策，對於人事不欲輕加更動，至於報紙合併，由於紙張供給問題而起，但各報之情形不同，强予合併，亦非一蹴可成之事，亟須詳加硏究，期臻完善，務使各報能多進展，以盡全報道之職責。宣傅要點應時勢之需要，隨時頒發。至於指導工作，現正由本部縝密計劃，但重在指導之綱領，期使各報能於範圍中獲得自由之發揮。</p>
<p>（問）現在各地雜誌之發行，在數量上不謂不多，但內容適合戰時者極少，非是軟性讀物，即是漫罵口吻之刋物，此種風氣似有糾正之必要。</p>
<p>雜誌整理逐步進行</p>
<p>（答）雜誌整理當逐步進行，現已對呈請登記者先行嚴密審查，然後再進一步對於已登記者重爲甄審。</p>
<p>（問）戰時之下，民心之把握，允推首要之圖，過去之宣政機關，對此點似不收實效，今後未識有如何具體方針？</p>
<p>（答）把握民心，自爲宣政要點，自當秉承中樞意旨，盡力爲之。</p>
<p>（問）重要國家新聞現均由宣傳部發表，又各機關之經常消息，現在有直接自已送稿者，有由宣傳部轉送者，通信及報社，但求消息之迅速。又定期接見記者，由宣傳最高當局發表時局之見解，或由記者隨時提出問題，請部次長解答，似殊有裨益，於事實眞相之明朗化，未知部長意見如何？</p>
<p>發表新聞集中辦理</p>
<p>（答表新聞除最重要者由部戰表公報外，應由中央社集中辦理，各部應與中央社取得聯絡，以求迅速，本部爲行政機關，並不直接發稿，有重要事項時，自當隨時接見記者，如有所問，儘可作書面提出，當無不樂於解答也。</p>

<h3>利用新聞政策　企圖威脅重慶　松平部長揭露敵美陰笁</h3>
<p>盟邦日本大使館上海事務所昨日下行循例舉行報道會議，松平報道部長發表談話如下：</p>
<p>二月二十二日美國紐約講壇報關於重慶新聞檢查制度之評論，其大要謂，最近外國報紙上暴露淪方內幕之紀事，日益增加，其原因由於重慶新聞檢查機關對於新聞之檢查，非當嚴格，外報特派員爲避免檢查起見，乃秘密將訊息逕寄本國，故而渝方內幕之暴露日多，其責任應由渝當局負之云云。</p>
<p>松平部長繼稱：最近美蘇報章雜誌登載暴露渝方內幕之文章日多，此種現象殊堪注意。二月十三日南北美洲十家華字報紙，曾聯合登載一聲明，評論重慶政策，此項聲明乃在抨擊淪府，實係美政府方面所指使可斷言，其有背景存在聲明之涵義約分四點：（一）重慶應採取美國式之民主主義（二）中和中國民族主義，。圓滑拒絕中國在國際方面之平等要求，（四）順利推進以東亞人制東亞人之策略。凡此種種均爲美政府方面之假借，以遂行其國家之新聞政策，方法巧妙，而用意則殊危險。渝常局應洞燭美方之奸計，深切反省切勿隨其衛中。又昨訊渝方十三家報紙，對於此項聯合聲明，巳一致加以抨擊云。</p>

<h3>Fierce Fighting on Iwo Jima; Japanese Suicide Squads Active; Garrison Forces Tenaciously Defend Positions with Fierce Counterattacks</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency): Since the enemy Americans landed on Iwo Jima a week ago, the battle situation has become increasingly fierce. Heavy fighting continued on the 24th, with the focus of operations in the area from Screen Rock to the south side of Motoyama Airfield. The second area of intense fighting is in the area south of Asotai, facing Nishito. The enemy has consistently attacked the central part of the island, but after fierce counterattacks by the main Japanese positions, enemy losses have become increasingly heavy.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency): Japanese suicide attack squads active on various fronts on Iwo Jima are infiltrating deep into enemy lines everywhere, bravely killing the enemy and destroying their supplies. On the night of the 21st, a suicide commando team led by Yamada Oboro on the island advanced from the west coast to the enemy command post near Chishima, killing and wounding many enemy soldiers and capturing operational maps from the command post. These maps contain extremely detailed information on the enemy's combat deployment.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency): The Japanese garrison on Iwo Jima is still holding key terrain, securing its main positions, and launching fierce counterattacks against the enemy, inflicting heavy damage. Since the 23rd, the enemy's main focus of attack has shifted to the Screen Rock and geothermal areas, attempting to penetrate the central part of the main Japanese positions. The Japanese garrison has also reinforced its forces at the enemy's main counterattack points, launching fierce attacks and completely shattering the enemy's plans. Since the 23rd, the front lines on the island have stabilized. At around 7:00 PM on the 25th, enemy forces in front of the Japanese positions attempted to penetrate the Asotai area from the western front of the island. The Japanese garrison immediately engaged them, initiating fierce fighting. Enemy forces on the southern front also amassed a force of 200 men near this area at 7:00 AM, launching an attack with tanks and using part of their force to attack the geothermal area. In response, the Japanese artillery units launched heavy shelling. At 9:30 AM on the 25th, the enemy's first line was formed from Asotai, Chishima Village, the geothermal area, and Screen Rock. The enemy's main focus appeared to be on the center, with 80 tanks attempting a strong advance from the geothermal area towards Motoyama Airfield. However, the Japanese forces isolated on Mount Suribachi are still fighting bravely. On the night of the 23rd, they dared to launch a large-scale melee assault, charging into the tank ranks and destroying many tanks. After the 24th, the Japanese flag can still be seen flying on the summit of Mount Suribachi.</p>
<p>Suribachi Mountain Riddled with Shell Holes</p>
<p>Central News Agency Report: According to a New York dispatch on the 24th, a U.S. Associated Press war correspondent reported the difficulties of the Iwo Jima operation as follows: The slow progress of the U.S. Marine Corps attack on Iwo Jima is quite disheartening. The soldiers currently with me on the beach all believe that the future operations will be the most difficult in the Pacific War. The area of Iwo Jima is extremely small, making operations extremely difficult and preventing the use of clever tactics. This morning, I witnessed the tragic situation of the U.S. Marine Corps attacking Mount Suribachi. The mountain is about 550 feet high, and due to intense bombing and shelling, the entire mountain is riddled with shell holes, almost like a honeycomb. Most of the Japanese gun emplacements, artillery caves, and tunnels have been destroyed, but the Japanese resistance is strong, and they are fiercely shelling the U.S. supply base and personnel ships on the beach. Although the Japanese shelling has temporarily decreased, it has become active again today. The Japanese defensive equipment is even more fortified, requiring three or four direct hits to disable it. Japanese soldiers are lurking everywhere on the island, even appearing at the Motoyama Airfield, which has already been occupied by the U.S. military. Therefore, the closer we get to Tokyo, the more difficult the operations become. U.S. naval shelling has the potential to harm U.S. troops on the island, so the battle must become an infantry war, and naval artillery has lost its effectiveness.</p>
<h3>Japanese Use Rocket Shells</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 26th (Central News Agency): The heavy rocket shells used by the Japanese on Iwo Jima are directly applied to front-line launchers, which is very different from the German V1 flying bombs launched from the rear. Their impact on the war situation is very significant. Enemy positions were quite alarmed upon receiving this news. According to a report by United Press correspondent Ronzebach, U.S. artillery experts believe that the new Japanese weapon exploded four days ago at the landing site of the U.S. Marine Corps in the southeast of Iwo Jima. The launch site is likely in the northern mountains, which provide protective firing positions. The emergence of this new weapon is clear evidence of the extensive defenses on Iwo Jima. The shell uses jet propulsion to fly through the air, and explodes upon impact using a fuse. In addition, the Japanese also use ordinary rocket launchers, anti-ground and anti-air dual-purpose guns, Japanese artillery, automatic rifles, and other weapons.</p>
<h3>U.S. Plans to Seize Chongqing Aviation Business</h3>
<p>According to reliable sources: Mao Bangchu, Director of Chongqing Aviation, went to the United States last autumn to attend the Chicago Aviation Conference and has now returned to Chongqing. On the 22nd of this month, he made a statement saying: Although international aviation will restore free competition in the future, China's civil aviation can still develop and will not be hindered, etc. The reason why Mao made this statement is that the United Kingdom and the United States had a secret understanding at this aviation conference: the United Kingdom recognized that the United States could control Chongqing's aviation business. Therefore, Mao made this statement to cover it up. The United States also plans to control the global aviation network in the future, so it pays close attention to the oil production situation in various oil-producing areas such as Iran, Iraq, and even the kerosene production in the Chinese mainland, which is the basis for seizing the international aviation network in the future.</p>
<h3>Japanese Prime Minister's Remarks</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency): After leaving the Imperial Palace on the night of the 25th, Prime Minister Koiso made the following remarks: Enemy planes that attacked Tokyo on the 25th dared to bomb the Shumaryo (horse department) of the Imperial Household Ministry and the guard station of the Omiya Imperial Palace. The damage was indeed minimal, but as a subject, I was terrified and at a loss. I immediately went to the palace to respectfully inquire about the Emperor's well-being, and went to the Imperial Residence to respectfully inquire about the Empress Dowager's well-being. Tomorrow morning, I will visit His Majesty the Emperor and humbly offer my apologies on behalf of the Cabinet. I and 100 million compatriots are indignant at the disrespectful behavior of the enemy planes and vow to kill and reduce the enemy Americans.</p>
<h3>Wuzhou Gradually Becoming Prosperous;督辦 Commissioner's Office Established in Guiping</h3>
<p>Wuzhou, 26th (Central News Agency): Since Guangxi's Wuzhou fell in late September last year, the market has recovered to its pre-war prosperity by May of this year. Before the war, Wuzhou had a population of about 150,000 to 160,000, and the number of returnees has reached 100,000. Wuzhou is located in the transportation center from the South China coast to the interior, and its Xijiang River basin is a distribution center for materials. The listing of materials has increased with the restoration of law and order, and various light industries and home handicrafts have gradually started work. Before the war, there were 42 leather factories, and 32 have resumed operations. Other small-scale industrial and commercial enterprises such as rice mills, soy sauce gardens, and electric wires have also resumed operations. A civil administration department has been established politically to guide the people. At the same time, Japanese banks such as Zhengjin and Taiwan have successively established branches, which has provided a lot of financial assistance. In the war ruins in southern Wuzhou, the people voluntarily donated 3.5 million yuan. Guiping, a key strategic location upstream of Wuzhou, has about 40,000 returning residents. A Guiping area 督辦 Commissioner's Office has now been established. A few days ago, Li Shaochang, the younger brother of Li Jishen, a veteran sent by the Southwest faction, took office as the 督辦 Commissioner and engaged in all restoration plans.</p>
<h3>Japanese Air Force Night Raid on the Banks of the Irrawaddy River; Destroyed Enemy Vehicles and River Crossing Facilities</h3>
<p>Burma Frontline Base, 26th (Central News Agency): Japanese air force units cooperated in the northward operation, attacking enemy troops on the banks of the Irrawaddy River. On the 24th, fighter squadrons launched a fierce attack on enemy motor vehicle units, setting three on fire and destroying 48 others. That night, a bomber formation attacked Nyaungbinwun (28 miles southwest of Pakokku), destroying four river crossing facilities (one of which was a major fire), inflicting great damage. The Japanese planes returned safely.</p>
<h3>Manila War Moves to the Periphery of the City; Japanese Troops Launch Surprise Attacks and Advances Everywhere</h3>
<p>Luzon Frontline, 26th (Central News Agency): On the 14th, a powerful Japanese force struck the flanks and rear of the large enemy American forces near Manila from the northeast of Manila. Since then, they have repeatedly launched surprise attacks and advances everywhere, ravaging enemy reinforcement and transportation units, or blowing up their supplies, continuing to advance like a whirlwind. One unit has approached the Manila coast south of Marololos, cutting off the enemy's supply line. Another team approached the city of Manila and joined forces with the naval forces of the entire former Magiliac camp, adding to its transfer and continuing to actively and decisively attack, achieving great results. At the same time, they have made considerable contributions to the Manila garrison. After achieving their goals, they returned to their original positions with bold and rapid action. The enemy concentrated all its forces outside the city of Manila, attempting to attack the Japanese strongholds in the eastern mountainous area of Manila. Their actions are gradually becoming active. One part used boats to travel upstream on the Pasig River and began landing south of Laguna de Bay in the southeast of Manila. Another part appeared on the same day with ten tanks as a vanguard, appearing near the eastern highlands of the Marikina airfield, 15 kilometers east of Manila. In the battlefields between Pasig and Marikina, 15 kilometers southeast of Manila, near Rosario, enemies possessing 15 cm howitzers and a large number of tanks are in action. In the area south of Novaliches, 10 kilometers northeast of Manila, enemy activity is also active. At the same time, there are no major changes on the northern front. Fierce fighting began at dawn on the 22nd in the San Nicolas area. Two battalions of enemy troops with 40 artillery pieces attacked the Japanese strongholds in the eastern highlands of Luzon. The war has now shifted from the streets of Manila to the periphery of the city, and from the plains and lowlands of central Luzon to the surrounding hills and mountains.</p>
<h3>Inland River Shipping between Shanghai and Suzhou</h3>
<p>—Wenxiang</p>
<p>During my school vacation this time, I originally planned to take the train home, but it was difficult to buy train tickets, and it was inconvenient to carry luggage. Coincidentally, a peanut boat from my hometown came, so I took a ride on the empty boat back. I lived on the boat for three days and four nights. The various things I saw along the way are probably known by very few people. Therefore, I will describe them below for the reference of those returning home.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Wharf</p>
<p>The boat was parked at the Zhongshan Bridge pier next to the Toyota Yarn Factory. On that day, there were more than 100 ships of various sizes, mostly empty boats, which had loaded goods such as firewood, soybeans, and peanuts from the mainland and came to Shanghai. After unloading, they were preparing to wait for the steamer to tow them back. In a Yu Yuanyuan teahouse in Zhoujiaqiao, it was crowded with all kinds of people of the upper, middle, and lower classes: boat owners, brokers, boat crew, gangsters, and "yellow shirts," all day long bustling and noisy, busy with nothing more than customs declaration, bargaining, and buying steamer tickets. It is said that when cargo ships arrive at the wharf, they are not allowed to declare customs unless the conditions are negotiated here. When the ship sets sail, the empty boats are first arranged in rows, connected to each other with ropes, and then connected row by row, totaling more than 40 boats, all large boats capable of carrying 300 to 400 dan of soybeans. The tugboat is called Ruijing. At this moment, the shouts of the boatmen and the roars of the boat owners, a constant stream of "Daohao!" sounds, were much more tense than taking the train. Standing at the bow of the boat from 10:00 AM, waiting on an empty stomach, it was not until 3:00 PM that we officially left Shanghai.</p>
<p>Passing Huangdu</p>
<p>Although it is only a short 50 li journey, the steamer towed for 17 hours. According to the boatmen, it was still very fast. This is because the river is narrow and shallow, the waterway is tortuous, and towing 40 large boats, if the speed is too fast, there is a risk of running aground. The boat left Yejidun, only a dozen li away from Shanghai, and it was already late, so we stayed overnight in Beixinjing. We continued the next morning, arriving at Xiaohuangdu at 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>The next day, the boat passed Dahuangdu, and the river suddenly widened. In addition, the water was strong, so the boats traveled in pairs. It took another day and night to reach Baodai Bridge in Suzhou, a distance of 160 Chinese li, with a speed of only six or seven li per hour. From Baodai Bridge onwards, the steamer untied its cables and left, and each boat had no choice but to use poles to move forward.</p>
<p>Extortion Along the Way</p>
<p>From Shanghai to Suzhou, a steamer ticket costs 13,000 yuan. Unexpectedly, just after leaving Shanghai, a small boat came to extort money from each boat, ranging from 500 to 1,000 yuan. From Shanghai to Huangdu, passing through Beixinjing, Yejidun, Zhouwangmiao, it can be said that there are checkpoints everywhere, and the blockade is heavy. Two people in a group, three people in a group, with various tricks, all had to unlock. It is said that this is the "rule": relying on the mountain to eat the mountain, relying on the water to eat the water. In total, including the expenses on the steamer, an empty boat had to spend 15,000 yuan in sweat money. The boat owner said that it was necessary to do so, and it was still worthwhile. If a boat traveled alone, the expenses would be even greater, and there would also be danger.</p>
<p>When the boat set sail, the boat owner informed the passengers in advance not to go out when we reached the blockade line to avoid trouble, so we almost completely lay in the cabin for three days. The boat had three meals a day, nothing more than pickles, so the hardship can be imagined. At night, the cold wind was piercing, and we huddled together unable to sleep. In addition, we could not raise our heads and stand upright during the day. Therefore, all those who took the boat complained endlessly.</p>
<p>Evacuation Tools</p>
<p>It is currently difficult to travel, as if trying to climb to the sky. If you bring family members and belongings, it is simply unthinkable. The train shouts to improve, but it is difficult to meet expectations. The steamer has a small capacity, so it is better to use civilian boats. First, you can carry heavy belongings, second, the whole family can travel together, which is convenient to take care of, and the losses are less. If Shanghai implements a large-scale evacuation, it is the most simple and economical. Schools, groups, charitable organizations, etc., can use the empty boats on the return trip, and the boat owners will also be happy to accept, which is a win-win situation, and will not be affected by external influences, such as fuel shortages, etc. The method can be to first investigate the ships coming to Shanghai from their hometowns at the wharf through the hometown association and register them, and then register the hometown compatriots returning home in advance. The military should be sent along the way to escort them, and the municipal government should issue certificates to avoid enemy fraud along the way. If this is done, it can be said to be foolproof.</p>
<p>Suzhou Countryside</p>
<p>When the boat reached Baodai Bridge, we heard rumors that empty boats were being sealed in Suzhou City, so boats of all sizes avoided the village riverbanks. The boat I was on originally planned to go straight to Changzhou, so we also bypassed the city and stayed overnight at Zhujiacun in Xinguoli, six li away from Huangtang Town. This place is eight or nine li away from the city, close to Mulong and Lingyan Mountain. The place is remote, and I was initially very afraid. After asking the villagers, they said that there were no bandits or disturbances in this place, and we were able to sleep peacefully. The next morning, I called a villager to carry the luggage and lead the way. I learned that the villagers in this place are unusually simple and honest, and there are absolutely no bad elements. The villagers did not show any surprise when they saw me wearing a student uniform. Prices are very cheap in Changdi. A pot of tea is only 20 yuan, the price of rice is 25,000 yuan, and a dan of firewood is 1,000 yuan. It can truly be said to be a paradise.</p>

<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 26th (Central News Agency): According to a London dispatch: a large formation of 1,100 U.S. bombers and 700 escort fighters bombed Munich and the Ruhr area, targeting railways, airfields, military industries, etc., especially launching a concentrated attack on Munich with more than 500 bombers.</p>
<h3>Street Fighting Unfolds in Breslau</h3>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency): According to frontline news: The initiative in the operations on the Niesse River front has returned to the hands of the German army. The German army has cleared several enemy bridgeheads, and the German army at the Guben bridgehead is still resisting the Soviet offensive.</p>
<p>Zurich, 26th (Central News Agency): The Soviet left wing continues its persistent attempts to break through in the Gorlitz area. The area between the Wohte River and the Niesse River is the main battlefield on the Eastern Front. The battle for the Breslau urban fortress has become even more intense. The Soviet forces suppressing the city's periphery seem to have started from the south. 100,000 German troops determined to defend the fortress to the death in the city center are launching street fighting with siege guns and machine guns. The German forces besieged in Konigsberg, East Prussia, have finally secured the city's connection with the outer harbor after several days of bold attacks.</p>
<h3>German Troops Destroy Water Gates; Ruhr River Floods; Fierce Street Fighting in Düren and Jülich</h3>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency): DNB reports: The German army has also destroyed a section of the steel pipe of the Ruhr water gate, causing the Ruhr River to rise again, and the war zone south of it has been flooded. It is expected that the enemy troops under Marshal Montgomery will have great difficulties in operating.</p>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency): On both sides of the Ruhr River, the enemy's reinforcements are endless, and the fighting is fierce. Enemy engineers are trying to establish a bridgehead, but they have been hit hard by German artillery fire. The street fighting in Düren and Jülich has not ended. The U.S. First and Ninth Armies have not yet established a larger bridgehead on the other side of the Ruhr River, so the enemy's tank units have not been able to exert their strength. Therefore, the battle of the Ruhr River cannot be said to have passed the first phase. Between the Meuse and the lower Rhine, the Canadian First Army continues to attack on the Goch-Weeze road. The casualties of U.S. and Canadian soldiers since the 15th have been over 10,000.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Problem of Unemployment Relief</h3>
<p>Recently, the central government formulated principles and methods for implementing streamlined administration, and the municipal authorities also implemented internal rectification to reduce the size of institutions and simplify them, focusing on reducing redundant personnel and improving work efficiency as the focus of rectification. This is the trend of layoffs in government agencies. At the same time, due to restrictions on electricity and raw materials, production has decreased in the city's industrial sector. Due to rising prices and reduced general purchasing power, business is slow in the commercial sector. Both industry and commerce have to increase salaries in order to take care of the livelihood of employees due to rising prices. Therefore, in order to adapt to the environment and balance income and expenditure, it is also necessary to implement layoffs and reduce expenditure. This is the trend of layoffs in industry and commerce.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether it is government agencies or industry and commerce, under the current circumstances, it is an inevitable situation to implement layoffs and reduce expenditure in order to strengthen themselves. As a result of the layoffs, the problem of unemployment arises, and the laid-off personnel become unemployed. Moreover, because the entire society has a trend of layoffs and reducing expenditure, the number of unemployed people is bound to be considerable. These unemployed people are either civil servants or industrial and commercial employees, all of whom are so-called salaried workers. In the past few years, the salaried class has been threatened by high prices and feels that their livelihoods are difficult. However, they still have an official position or salary, which can be used to supplement their income. If they are unemployed, they will not be able to obtain even this meager salary, and prices will be even higher, making life even more difficult. Let us imagine how serious this panic will be!</p>
<p>In view of the above situation, we cannot but pay close attention to the problem of unemployment that we are facing. The problem of unemployment is one aspect of the overall social problem, and the government and society should jointly take responsibility for relief. We take the lead in providing our humble opinions for discussion:</p>
<p>(1) Government agencies and industrial and commercial enterprises should provide severance relief funds to laid-off personnel to the greatest extent possible, so that their lives will not be immediately affected.</p>
<p>(2) Government agencies should provide laid-off employees with certificates of service. When inland agencies need staff, they should give priority to employing them according to their abilities. Industrial and commercial enterprises should provide laid-off employees with certificates, giving priority to reinstatement or employment when they resume business or need them. Of course, those with poor character and poor performance are exceptions.</p>
<p>(3) The Social Welfare Bureau should consult with civil social welfare and social service organizations to organize an unemployed personnel registration office, register the skills of the unemployed, classify and compile them, and introduce them when there is an opportunity. They should also contact inland agencies, guilds, and chambers of commerce to recommend talents.</p>
<p>(4) The population evacuation is currently being carried out, and the unemployed are also included in the evacuation. From the perspective of the unemployed themselves, it is best to evacuate from Shanghai. Those who have a home to return to can simply return to their place of origin. Those who have no home to return to should immediately join the locations designated by the Evacuation Committee. However, the most important thing to pay attention to is to abandon class concepts. For example, those who originally worked as writers do not need to write after evacuation, but should accept the assignments of the times when they need to pick up a hoe.</p>
<p>As the saying goes: "If you are prepared for anything, you will succeed." The problem of unemployment is already an inevitable trend. It is hoped that the authorities and social leaders will pay attention together, take advantage of the implementation of the population evacuation, and at the same time take care of unemployment relief, so that the unemployed can be arranged and social order can be guaranteed and peaceful.</p>
<h3>Minister Zhao Discusses Propaganda Implementation Plan; Guidance Work Under Planning</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 26th (Central News Agency) - Since Minister Zhao of the Propaganda Department took office, he has been comprehensively planning the propaganda system of the national government under the decisive battle, and is now gradually implementing it. Yesterday, a reporter paid a special visit to Minister Zhao to inquire about the current propaganda policies and strategies. The following is the response:</p>
<p>(Question) Since you took office as minister, we have gleaned the general outline of the key points of propaganda administration from your previous talks. However, the specific promotion policy has not yet been published. For example, regarding the propaganda organization, is there a need to reform the four-division structure of the Propaganda Department at the central level in today's decisive battle period? Furthermore, war propaganda organs have been established in Shanghai, Hankou, and other places, joined by propaganda organs from allied countries to strengthen their power. Is such an organization also necessary in the capital? Also, regarding the propaganda organizations in various provinces and cities, special cities and northern Jiangsu still have propaganda offices, while provincial governments only have sections, which seems to be an imbalanced development. Moreover, it seems necessary to unify the central and local propaganda administrations. What are your thoughts on this?</p>
<p>No Changes to the Propaganda Department's Structure for Now</p>
<p>(Answer) There will be no changes to the structure of the Propaganda Department for now. The establishment of new war propaganda organs must await instructions from the central government. As for close contact with the propaganda organs of allied countries, that is naturally not a problem. The abolition of propaganda offices and the establishment of sections in the provinces is one of the items in the provincial administration reform plan. If the central government reforms the administrative structures of various special cities and northern Jiangsu in the future, this issue can be submitted for discussion.</p>
<p>(Question) The national government's news policy has been decided long ago. Recently, the News Association was established. I wonder if the Propaganda Department has any plans to refresh newspapers in various places. Are there any considerations for merging major newspapers, prioritizing the allocation of newsprint, and adjusting personnel? In the past, the Propaganda Department issued propaganda guidelines for special news, which was quite effective. However, this was a temporary measure. It seems that regular propaganda guidance is also very important. I wonder if there is any consideration for this.</p>
<p>Propaganda Guidelines Issued at Any Time</p>
<p>(Answer) The Propaganda Department adopts a sound strategy for newspapers in various places and does not want to make any personnel changes lightly. As for the merger of newspapers, it arises from the problem of paper supply, but the circumstances of each newspaper are different. Forcing mergers is not something that can be accomplished overnight and requires detailed research to achieve perfection, so that each newspaper can make more progress and fulfill its responsibility of comprehensive reporting. Propaganda guidelines will be issued at any time according to the needs of the situation. As for guidance work, the department is now meticulously planning it, but it focuses on the guiding principles so that each newspaper can have the freedom to develop within the scope.</p>
<p>(Question) The number of magazines issued in various places is not small, but very few of the contents are suitable for wartime. They are either soft reading materials or publications with abusive tones. It seems necessary to correct this trend.</p>
<p>Magazine Rectification Proceeding Step by Step</p>
<p>(Answer) Magazine rectification will proceed step by step. We have already begun to conduct strict reviews of those applying for registration, and then we will further re-examine those who have already registered.</p>
<p>(Question) Under wartime conditions, winning the hearts of the people is undoubtedly the primary task. It seems that past propaganda organs have not achieved practical results in this regard. What specific policies will be implemented in the future?</p>
<p>(Answer) Winning the hearts of the people is, of course, a key point of propaganda administration. We will, of course, follow the instructions of the central government and do our best to achieve it.</p>
<p>(Question) Important national news is currently released by the Propaganda Department. In addition, for regular news from various agencies, some now send manuscripts directly, while others are forwarded by the Propaganda Department. News agencies and newspapers only seek the speed of news. Furthermore, holding regular meetings with reporters, where the highest authority of propaganda releases views on the current situation, or where reporters ask questions at any time and ask the vice ministers to answer, seems to be particularly beneficial to clarifying the truth. What is your opinion on this?</p>
<p>Centralized News Release</p>
<p>(Answer) Apart from the most important news being released by the department's wartime public reports, it should be handled centrally by the Central News Agency. Various departments should establish contact with the Central News Agency to seek speed. The Propaganda Department is an administrative organ and does not directly release manuscripts. When there are important matters, we will, of course, meet with reporters at any time. If there are any questions, they can be submitted in writing, and we will be happy to answer them.</p>

<h3>First Round of Affordable Rice Distribution; Committee Decides on Rice Collection and Payment Methods Starting Today</h3>
<p>The affordable rice purchased by the city government has been successively shipped to Shanghai. In order to handle the inspection, acceptance, and distribution work, a special affordable rice committee has been organized to take charge. The committee held its second meeting yesterday (the 26th) to discuss implementation methods. It is reported that the key points of the decision are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The first batch of 30,000 dan of affordable rice has already been fully shipped to Shanghai by the Rice Control Committee and delivered to the city government's storage warehouses. It is now stipulated that distribution will begin this afternoon. Please ask each household to obtain a rice collection form from the person in charge of the national entity of their respective units. Collect rice at the designated warehouse in accordance with the previously agreed-upon order.</p>
<p>(2) Please ask the police bureau to order all sub-bureaus to provide protection for the transportation of affordable rice along the way and to allow it to pass without inspection. The transportation certificate will be issued by the committee.</p>
<p>(3) The price of the second batch of 30,000 dan of affordable rice is set at 37,000 yuan per dan. The payment date is from today to March 2. It is hoped that all households under the respective units will pay attention.</p>
<p>(4) The payment for the second batch of rice must still be in cash. All payments will be collected by the Fuxing Bank on behalf. However, each household must first obtain a payment notice from the Fuxing Bank from their respective unit organizations before depositing it into the Fuxing Bank headquarters or branches. The locations are listed below:</p>
<p>Headquarters: 303 Henan Road.</p>
<p>Southern District Branch: Intersection of Taishan Road and Machang Road.</p>
<p>Western District Branch: 247 Yuyuan Road.</p>
<p>Northern District Branch: Inside the Central Market at the northern end of the New Garbage Bridge.</p>
<h3>Police Bureau Continues to Investigate Gambling Den Case; List of Arrested Employees and Gamblers Announced</h3>
<p>In order to thoroughly refresh the city's appearance and wash away the poisonous atmosphere, the city police bureau is cracking down on all kinds of illegal businesses. The large gambling den at 147 Weihaiwei Road, the "Russian General Association," was also raided the night before. The den owner, Wang Maoting, and the manager, Han Huaqing (erroneously reported as Meng Qing in yesterday's newspaper), have been arrested one after another, and 174 employees and gamblers were arrested on the spot and will be investigated, and a large amount of gambling money, gambling equipment, and pledges were seized. It is now known that the bureau's third division investigation and trial section is continuing a meticulous investigation. Wang Maoting, a native of Zhenjiang, is 57 years old. He used to be a translator at the former French Concession Police Department and a university professor. The former Qiuyuan Club and Suzhou Hongyun Cafe were also opened by him. It was not until the end of the lunar year last year that he signed a contract with a Russian to invest in opening a gambling den at that location and gathered crowds to gamble. This time, the long arm of the law finally caught him. The list of arrested employees and gamblers is as follows:</p>
<p>List of Employees: Wang Maoting, Han Huaqing, Li Jisan, Li Shanhe, Xu Puqing, Le Xinhua, Liu Shoujing, Pan Fusheng, Shen Jingen, Le Zhichang, Zhou Wenqing, He Sheng, Shen Lizhong, Zhang Wengao, Guo Zengfu, Yin Zhongmao, Zhao Fang, Li Ziyuan Dan, Ma Wenbiao, Feng [omitted], Lei Yuan, Ruan Zhiying, Qi Huailiang, Chen Huizhen, Hu Zhang, [omitted] Naiqiang, Li Yingzhai, Dong Biao, Gu Shuiquan, etc., and Russian employees Dalinina, Xinanxu, Cailai, Aimulu, Man'erlai Aiqingmen, Shaluo Zaian, Ximengsi, Denixiefu, Keliweina, Gefeiai, Kaizhan, etc., and Portuguese Kauf Aim Pao Tuier Hu.</p>

All gambling offenders will be investigated.</p>
<h3>Claim That Flour Distribution Will Be Stopped Is Completely Untrue</h3>
<p>According to the Propaganda Department, the amount of bread distributed in the city has recently been halved, and it has been rumored that flour distribution will be stopped due to electricity restrictions starting from the first of next month. It has now been indicated by relevant parties that the reduction in the amount of bread distributed is entirely due to merchants' tricks, and the claim that flour distribution will be stopped is absolutely untrue.</p>
<h3>Police Bureau Increases Police Salaries and Allowances</h3>
<p>In order to improve the treatment of police officers, the city police bureau, in addition to providing free rice every month, has also completed adjustments to salaries and allowances. It is calculated that salaries have been increased by between 250% and 350% of the original salary, adjusted separately according to the original salary. Starting from this (second) month, the minimum monthly salary for police officers in the urban area is 14,475 yuan, and the minimum monthly salary for police officers in the suburban area is 10,475 yuan. The new salaries and allowances for this month will be issued starting today (27th), and the heads of each branch bureau and team and other units will collect them from the accounting section of the general bureau for distribution.</p>
<h3>Economic Bureau Personnel on Duty: Extortion Can Be Reported</h3>
<p>In order to rectify government discipline, the city's Economic Bureau, when dispatching personnel to investigate cases, in addition to wearing badges and employee cards to prove their identity, also holds a temporary special duty certificate as proof to prevent impostors. According to the person in charge: the bureau provides special duty expenses for personnel dispatched to investigate cases, which are reimbursed based on actual expenses. The personnel dispatched are absolutely not allowed to solicit any fees from merchants outside. If there are any cases of extortion by personnel on duty, merchants can report it to the bureau for strict punishment.</p>
<h3>Security Command Destroys Extortion Gang; Dozens of Robberies in the City</h3>
<p>The investigation team of the city's Security Command, in view of the frequent occurrence of theft and extortion by impersonating public officials in the city during air raids, team leader Gu Baolin ordered his subordinates to step up investigations. They received a tip that bandits Zhou Jinfang (also known as Zhou Xiaomao), Zhang Yuchang, and Chuan Aju were carrying six-inch and four-inch handguns, respectively, and were specializing in robbery in the city during air raids and darkness. The team dispatched personnel to conduct a strict investigation and arrested Zhou Jinfang at 228 Songshan Road, along with a Ma brand handgun (number 88428), six bullets, and a knife. Zhang Yuchang and Chuan Aju were arrested at the entrance of the China Hotel, along with a four-inch handgun and eight bullets. They confessed to dozens of robberies in the city. The case has been submitted to the military law office for trial. According to another tip, Yan Yuming, a merchant from Nanhui, came to Shanghai to purchase goods and stayed in room 435 of the Great Shanghai Hotel. At about 12:00 a.m. on the 21st of this month, four hooligan youths, Yang Jie, Meng Guitao, Qu Jingen, and Yang Shiming, suddenly rushed into the room and claimed that Yan Yuming was a roving bandit who had killed people and had to be sent to the gendarmerie for strict handling. Under duress, Yan Yuming asked for leniency and paid 1.2 million yuan. Since there was a shortage of cash, two checks were written for 860,000 yuan, one appropriation slip for 240,000 yuan, and 100,000 yuan in cash to resolve the matter. The team dispatched personnel to the Mainland, Great Shanghai, Southeast, and Xin hotels and arrested the principal offenders Meng Guitao, Yang Jie, and Yang Shiming. Qu Jingen fled and was not captured. Two checks for 860,000 yuan were seized. Later, the accomplices Lu Xilin, Sun Yunde, and Hu Jinji were arrested at the Tianjin Muyi Zhong Qian Zhuang, and one appropriation slip for 240,000 yuan was seized from Lu Xilin. All were taken back to the team. After interrogation, they confessed to the crime and have now been sent to the Ministry of Military Law Office for trial.</p>
<h3>Graduation Ceremony Held for Reporter Training Class</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese News Association held a youth reporter training class to train new reporters. Since the training began last year, it has now come to an end. The association held a grand graduation ceremony at 4:00 p.m. on the 27th at the auditorium of the Shiyi Association on the Bund. President Li issued graduation certificates and invited relevant officials from Chinese and Japanese organizations in the city and the news media to attend the ceremony.</p>
<h3>Changning Police Sub-Bureau Eliminates Malpractices at the West Railway Station</h3>
<p>Since Yao Benyuan, the chief of the police sub-bureau in charge of the West Railway Station, was transferred to his post, he has been determined to overcome all difficulties and eliminate bad habits to benefit the general public. On the one hand, he selected honest and capable police officers to be stationed at the station to be responsible for rectification. On the other hand, he consulted with the stationmaster of the West Railway Station to agree on cooperative methods and jointly combat bad practices. He has successively arrested six scalpers, including Zhou Weizheng and Wu Fugen, and dealt with them severely according to law. Yesterday, he issued a notice stating: "It has been observed that the practices of selling black-market tickets and extortion have been prevalent in the station area, causing suffering to travelers for a long time. Since the chief of this sub-bureau was transferred to Changning, he has been determined to eliminate the malpractices at the station. Therefore, he has selected honest and capable police officers to be responsible for management and consulted with the stationmaster of China Railways to cooperate in suppressing these practices. All military and police personnel who do not comply with laws and regulations and continue to engage in the aforementioned malpractices will be punished by military law. All black-hat scalpers and others who do not repent will be arrested and severely punished. The public must not engage in bribery, smuggling, or purchasing black-market tickets. Those who dare to violate these regulations will be punished. All are to comply."</p>
<h3>Memorial Service Held Yesterday for the First Anniversary of Geng Jiaji's Death</h3>
<p>Geng Jiaji, the late Central Committee member and government advisor, passed away in Shanghai on February 7th of last year. All circles in the city mourned his loss. Yesterday was the anniversary of Geng's death, and his family held a memorial service at Zhuangyan Temple. Those attending from various circles in the city included Ding Mocun and Luo Junqiang.</p>
<h3>Utilizing News Policies to Attempt to Threaten Chongqing; Minister Matsudaira Reveals Enemy American Conspiracy</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Office of the Allied Japanese Embassy held its routine press conference yesterday. Minister Matsudaira delivered the following speech:</p>
<p>The New York Tribune published a commentary on February 22 regarding the Chongqing news censorship system, the main points of which were: recently, articles exposing the inside stories of the occupied areas have been increasing in foreign newspapers. This is because the Chongqing news censorship authorities are very strict in censoring news. In order to avoid censorship, foreign correspondents secretly send information directly to their home countries, resulting in the exposure of more inside stories of Chongqing. The responsibility for this should be borne by the Chongqing authorities.</p>
<p>Minister Matsudaira continued: Recently, American and Soviet newspapers and magazines have published more and more articles exposing the inside stories of Chongqing. This phenomenon is noteworthy. On February 13, ten Chinese-language newspapers in North and South America jointly published a statement commenting on Chongqing's policies. This statement criticizes the occupied government and can be asserted to have been directed by the American government. There is a background to it. The meaning of the statement can be divided into four points: (1) Chongqing should adopt American-style democracy; (2) Moderate Chinese nationalism; (3) Smoothly reject China's equal demands in the international arena; (4) Smoothly promote the strategy of using East Asians to control East Asians. All of these are pretenses by the American government to carry out its national news policies, with clever methods and dangerous intentions. The Chongqing authorities should be aware of the American side's conspiracy and deeply reflect, and must not follow its lead. It was also reported yesterday that thirteen newspapers in Chongqing had unanimously criticized this joint statement.</p>
<h3>Associations That Have Not Yet Paid Winter Relief Funds and Military Donation Should Pay Immediately</h3>
<p>According to the person in charge of the Citizens Welfare Association: In order to raise 10 million yuan for winter relief funds and military and police donations, the various industry associations were asked to share the burden, and the city chamber of commerce and the association notified all associations to pay by the 25th of this month. It is now known that some associations have not yet paid in full. It is hoped that they will send the money to the collecting agencies (Bank of Communications, Jincheng Bank, Xinwen Bao and Shen Bao Social Service Office) as soon as possible to complete the procedures.</p>

<p>Letter to the Editor: Dear Editor, We recently read in your newspaper of the 26th of this month that a "cooked water shop disregarded the law and arbitrarily raised the price to 30 [currency units, likely yuan] per scoop." After investigation, the approved price for cooked water is 15 [currency units, likely yuan] per scoop, and most businesses are complying. We have never heard of anyone selling it for 30 [currency units, likely yuan] per scoop, nor have we received any reports. We are writing to request a correction. If anyone discovers cooked water being sold at an arbitrarily increased price, we hope they will report it at any time so that we can forward it to the authorities for handling. Sincerely, Shanghai Special Municipality Cooked Water Industry Association. February 26th.</p>
