<p>東京入日中央社電大東亞各地最近戰况如下：　菲律賓方面，由薩拉克薩克巴列拉方面北上之美軍第三十七師，與自阿巴利方面南進之第十一帥之一部，六月二十五日左右，似已於茲克加　取得連絡，地方因之乃宣傳呂宋作戰已吿結束，而呂　北部之日軍部隊，刻仍據卡牙因溪谷西方及碧瑤北方山岳地帶奮戰中，又　尼刺東方山岳地帶之日部隊，亦同樣續行奮戰中。　西南太平洋方面，對峇厘巴板攻擊之敵軍，七月一日以登陸用舟艇二百五十艘開始登陸，當時兵力約七千名，其後逐次增　，現有一萬五千左右。敵軍對資源地帶之婆羅洲方面作戰，可謂初次入於所謂有利作戰中，一方對馬辰之空襲亦逐次强化，三四兩日俱以少數機　强發動攻擊。　緬甸方面，緬甸戰綫無火變化，瓦城東南地區日軍部隊，仍確保婆雷姆卡勞附近，對來襲之敵勇敢奮戰，庇古山脈日軍部隊，據山岳地帶阻止侵攻之敵軍。喜丹河下游方面敵軍，乃印度第五師，英第十七師計二師約二萬名，有戰車五十輛，砲約一百二十門，現企圖渡越喜丹河向日方進犯，惟因該方面正値雨季，雙方作戰行動備受阻碍，然日部隊士氣旺盛，展開勇戰中。　卡尼可巴方面，七月六日以空母二艘爲基幹之艦船十四艘，在東南海面實施描省工作，惟不見任何活潑動向，此項敵新金圖宜加警戒。</p>
<h3>浙省成立　空災救委會</h3>
<p>杭州八日中央社電浙省府爲適應戰時需要，特成立空襲災害救濟委員會，茲業已擬具有關防災及救濟等各項方案，且期強化空災救濟防衛了作。</p>
<h3>日關東及九州　昨先後空襲　B29型機初襲南島島</h3>
<p>東京八日中央社電　黃島茲地之敵P37型機約百五十架，由B29型機三架領導，八日下午零時二分，一時半，分三梯團一來袋關東地區，攻擊京　地方及茨城房總方面之軍事設施及飛機場，日方　失輕微。</p>

<p>中部太平洋基地八日巾央社電　敵B20型機十餘架，七日畫問來裝南島島，按B29來襲該島，此為　。</p>
<p>美新設戰略航空隊</p>
<p>東京八日中央社電美航空總部長阿諾爾特，於巡視太平洋基地完畢後，美陸軍部次長巴達遜，即於七日發表稱，為對日作戰起見，已新設立一戰略航空隊，任命艾森霍華麾下之歐洲美空軍司令官史巴茲上將爲該隊司令官，屬於該隊管轄者，計有特里脫爾中將直屬之第八航空隊及　里亞納之第二十航空隊，並進昇少將羅美為第二十航空隊司令官云。如是，史巴茲將與馬里亞納之第二十航空隊同時進駐沖繩島，統轄特里脫爾之第八航空隊，企圖於兩正面作戰下，加强空襲日本。美空軍陣容之調整，蓋鑒於馬里亞納之一千架B29型機，再加業已集合於冲繩之戰鬥轟炸機九百架，此項龐大之航空勢力及對日戰略攻擊使命之重要性，故亟需新設立統合司令官。按第二十航空司令官羅美，以殘暴轟炸著稱，今以特爾脫爾聯合擬從兩正面轟炸日本本土，　種策謀，顯示美國人之作風，殊令人憤激發指，益增誓必殲此　敵之決心。六月十七日以來，馬里亞納基地之敵B29型機，迭次　炸日本土之中小都市，遭其茶毒者，已二十餘市，九州南部地區，曾遭冲繩基地之北美B25及巾小型頻繁攻學。又關東地區則遭由　黃島飛出之P51型機　，於最近連日攻擊，如是，敵於强化對日轟炸陣形後，預料此後之攻　將益趨激烈。敞此種空中攻擊，厥為對日本本土登陸之前奏，由敵方之空中攻軍，預測之本土登陸作戰即將實施，故日方對於此種攻擊，除極力將其阻止外，更須將焦土早日化爲戰一力，落減輕敵之轟炸效果期於？敵登陸之日，爲一舉制勝計，益加處發　　，隱忍待機。</p>
<p>少年飛行兵</p>
<p>基地一帶，老下着雨。每天細雨濛濛，眞是黃梅天氣哪！冲繩列島附近，氣壓很低，烏雲不斷在大空推移。天氣雖然這樣，爲了準備未來的作戰起見，特攻隊不住地出沒於　際，始終不懈。當我們到達這基地時，正下大雨，然而隔不多時，我們看到若干架特攻機日着惡劣的氣候，安然降落。</p>
<p>「少年飛行兵第幾期的畢業生在這裏有嗎？」一個伍長跨下飛機後，就向「整備兵」（整理飛機　件的兵士）詢問。</p>
<p>「有的，在那邊。」</p>
<p>伍長三脚兩步地向兵舍奔去。老同學碰在一起，該多麽快樂呀！兵舍中，三側仆長圍住了他，欣喜地交談。他們談些什麼，我雖聽不到，想必是在互訴衷　吧。少年飛行兵出身的人，交誼和普通學校的同學不同，特別純潔。</p>
<p>枝頭同開的櫻花</p>
<p>少年飛行兵入校以後，受幾個月的共同敎育後，即分科受特種技能的訓練，有些入飛行科，有些進機械科，有些入通信科。在幾個月中曾偶然聚集一起的靑年，出校以後，每在想不到的地方碰頭。譬如大家都作了特攻隊，而會在一起，便是一例。現在，圍在屋伍長周圍的，就是整備班的武藤伍長，掩護戰鬥機隊的木原伍長及通信班的大村伍長。</p>
<p>「啊，你也幹嗎？唉，假如我在學校時代進了飛行科，那就好啦！」</p>
<p>「別這麽說，我要出發了，請你把我的飛機好好整頓一下吧。」</p>
<p>「能够收到你「我突入空母」的成功的電報，那末我幾年來的苦練也不是白費的了。」大村伍長說。</p>
<p>「你屬於奈少尉的編隊嗎？是我担任掩護呢！敵機來阻撓的話。「格拉曼型機」不必說，就是P51或P47，我也要和他拼命，讓你們可以安心直術敵艦。」這是木原伍長的話。</p>
<p>特攻·整備·掩護·通信，這四位工作各異的同學，緊緊團結一起，比鋼鐵還堅固。</p>
<p>「你我是同時的櫻花，盛放在戰果的枝頭。更繽紛落去，爲了國家！」四個雄偉的身姿，搭着肩頭走向</p>
<p>那方，消沒在廣闊的飛行塲外。是晚，我做了一夜的夢，夢見四朶櫻花密密開在一起：</p>
<p>肩負祖國的命運</p>
<p>整備班的武藤伍長，通宵未眠，用心收拾屋伍長的飛機。張大了絡滿血絲的限，用電筒照之又照，無論怎樣細小的毛病，都不肯放鬆。天剛黎明時，屋伍長與其他特攻隊員，列隊飛機塲上，傾聽部隊長訓示。</p>
<p>「祖國的命運，全繫於各位肩上！」部隊長興奮地喊道。屋伍長們，緊緊握注了刀柄。</p>
<p>出浚的時候已到。飛機的推進漿已在旋轉。担任掩護工作的木原伍長，緊握着屋伍長的手。沉着地說：「願你成功！」然後，各登坐機。大村·武藤兩伍長，揮帽歡送屋伍長及其同僚。一陣巨響，一架一架的飛機剎那問沒入南國的太空。</p>
<p>一片血紅的火花</p>
<p>屋伍長凝望前方，緊握着操縱桿。剛剛飛抵距離目的地不遠之處，前方突然出現十餘黑點。</p>
<p>「敵機！」屋伍長不覺咬了一下嘴唇。</p>
<p>這時，上空忽然掠過了幾條黑影。原來是友軍的戰鬥機，他們搖動雙　，發出信號。</p>
<p>「木原，全靠你啦！」屋伍長不禁喊了出來</p>
<p>友軍戰鬥機集成一團，猛然衝向敵機羣中，立刻擊下五·六架，將敵機打得落花流水。</p>
<p>這時，無綫電收到了呼喊屋伍長所駕飛機的電報。一定是大村伍長從基地拍來的。可是，屋伍長暫時不作答覆。未幾，目標已在眼前。特攻隊各機於是改變隊形。</p>
<p>「神機到，各向目標衝去！」奈隊長發出信號。</p>
<p>這時，敵戰鬥機穿過了掩護的防綫，從四面飛來攻擊屋伍長，敵方的防空砲火，也發狂似地亂射。可是，屋伍長什麽都不管，穿過了火網，避過了敵機，靜靜地找尋目標。海上，有戰艦，有巡洋艦，還有航空母艦。屋伍長選定了目標，開始進攻。這時，旁邊飛來一架友機，振着　。原來是木原伍長的飛機。</p>
<p>「木原，謝謝你！」同時，屋伍長的左手輕輕按着發報鍵，拍回電給基地道：「我向空母突入了。」</p>
<p>敵方的戰鬥機緊追左右，木原伍長盡力驅散他們，爲屋伍長殺開一家血路。是時候了，操縱桿平穩的向右倒下去，屋伍長的飛機就像彈丸一樣，開始急降下。速度愈來愈快，眼前的敵方航空母艦也愈來愈大。映人屋伍長雙瞪的最後一幕，便是一片鮮紅的火光。</p>
<p>這是我的夢。實際上一定更加悲壯。自從雷伊泰一役以來，已有許多特攻隊如此爲國盡忠了。他們的偉大，是我們應該記取的。（尾島報道班員·譯自六月八日每日新聞）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>防空演習的重大意義</h3>
<p>今日又是照例演習的定期防空日，當局已經公布這次演習的六大目標，將認眞實施　。回顧過去十八次的演習成績，說一句老實話，我們看不到什麼特別成績，當局和奉令演習的人　管流汗辛苦的認眞演習，而大部分市民還是我行吾　，能够目動協力遵守規則的還是少數。但是，我們必須認淸，防空演習決不是演戲，演者自演，觀衆自觀，其最大要求，是要使全體市民養成自動的習慣。如果照這一標準來看，則過去十八次演習，似乎尚有許多未能令人滿意的地方。</p>
<p>更進一步說，防空演習是一種集體的行動，也就是一種有計劃有組織的行動，這種行動的成績壞劣，直接反映社會有無組織。如果永遠演習自演習，而一般市民漠不關心，至多只是在上面的倡導之下，勉强敷衍一下，這樣徒然暴露我們社會的無組織，散漫無力。在演習時如此，在實際空襲下更必形成各不相顧驚慌失拈的危險現象。這種社會狀態任其繼讀，還那裏談得到將來國家復興建設？所以，我們今後對於防空演習，當視爲對於社會組織力的一種測騐，非每一次演習的成績都較上一次進步不可。</p>
<p>防空演習在今日，同時又是市民公德心的一大測騐。即以防制燈光外洩一點而言，按當局規定，凡查有一家一室有光外洩，即有視當時情形而將該家及其附近一甲一保割斷其電流供給的規定，就是一個人的不守規則，就將連累附近多數人受災。凡是具有公德心的，常然再不會不守規則了。擴大來說，正因爲一人的不愼，會影響大衆，所以凡是有公德心的人，就必不僅以自己當心謹愼爲足，還必須隨時關顧共附近。有無　違犯防空法令的行爲。這樣，防空演習可說是一種涵義公德心的舉措了。我們希望市民對此都有相當的認識。</p>
<p>任何一種運動，都需要領導人物以身作則，防空也不能例外。但是，我們常常看到有不少公共機關的房屋裏有光外洩的事實，我們雖然不想列舉其眞實名構，但是一般市民是很明白的，如果以爲我們是公務機關，就可以不守防空法則，那麼對於一般市民心理影響之壞，又是如何？還有一般公務人員，自己固然很了解遵守防空法則的重要，但是對於自己的家屬傭工們，也許未加隨時查察　誠，結果往往有違犯防空規則的事實，這一點我們也希望公務機開尤共是公　人員特別注意。</p>
<p>我們認為防空演習，除了本身的意義之外，尚有　造人心及革新社會風暴的重大意義，除了上述三點之外，常此夏令，我們還希望一般市民信守早眠早起的習慣，最好晚間根本不用電燈，一般在電燈光下打牌·跳舞的，如果能厲行早起早眠，必能慢慢體會到生活之更有意　，節省了無　浪費的時問，也就增加了身心兩方面有益的因素，對於自身，對於社會國家，都是非常有益的。</p>
<h3>國民政府宣戰佈告</h3>
<p>前年十二月八日，大東亞戰爭發動之始，國民政府根據中日基本關係條約之精神，聲明決與友邦日本同甘共苦。自是以來，着手新國民運動，從事保障治安，改善中民生，期於增進國力，協助大東亞戰爭之完遂。乃英美等仍沿用共百年以來分裂東亞之政策，且變本加厲，竟勾引渝方份子，參加所謂英美戰綫，出兵緬印，以東亞人殘殺東亞人，最近因其暴力已次第爲友邦日本陸海空軍所擊破，侵略東亞之根據地亦已喪失，乃益逞狡謀，且嫉視國民政府統治區域之和平發展，嗾使渝方份子，不斷侵擾，以阻撓各種建設之進行，並逕以自國飛機，藉渝方爲根據，向我武漢廣州等處，屢施轟炸，殘害平民。在渝方份子，甘受英美驅使，躬爲東亞叛逆，固屬可恥；而英美對於東亞處心積慮，盡其挑撥離間之能事，以圖逐其最後併吞之欲，尤爲東亞民族所當同仇敵愾。國民政府爲此宣告，自今日起對英美處於戰爭狀態，當悉其全力，與友邦日本協力，一掃英美之殘暴，以謀巾國之復興，柬亞之解放。滿泰兩國，夙敦友好，對於東亞共榮，尤具同心，今後常益謀提携，以期共同建設以道義爲基礎之東亞新秩序。德義諸友邦，數年以來，在西方與英美勢力周旋，迭獲勝利之光榮，我國今茲參加大東亞戰爭，當相興呼應，以期對於世界全體之公正的新秩序有所貢獻，凡我國民，當知此為實現　國父大亞洲主義之唯一時會，中華民國之復興，大東亞榮建設之實現，世界全體正義和平之獲得，胥擊於此；其一心一德，戮力始終，以貫徹此偉大時代之偉大使命。中華民國三十二年一月九日　主席汪兆銘</p>

<h3>米開禁與朱家角湯毅</h3>
<p>自從國府對米　實施緊急措置，開放米禁，停止收購後，上海米價雖見回降，內地米價却因之上外。恢復米糧自由流通一措施，對今後的米價，究將發生何等影響，一般人對此頗感興趣，爰特訪問米源地之——靑沛及朱冢角，從談地之米糧運銷價格上，推測今後之趨勢。</p>
<p>開禁前後</p>
<p>第一，在米糧未恢復自由流通之前，上海與靑浦的米價　然懸殊，通常相差到三分之一以上，因此，名義上雖說統制，仍有商人私運來滬。第二，一部份農民仍藏有　餘米糧，開禁以後，農民才敢三石五石的運到靑浦或朱家角鎮上，所以米開禁並沒有使當地的存米　枯竭。第三，按照過去情形，上海米價比靑浦城內高，靑浦比朱家角高。現在大體上雖未變更，但當上海米價回迭時，靑浦首先跌價，朱家角的市面不及靑浦鎮活，所以有時反比城內價格高些，以上三點，說明過去上海米價上　，主要推動力量是人爲的阻塞與投機，並不全因米糧的缺乏；是產米區道隨上海米價，不是產地漲價而影響上海米價。自由流通與停止收購，雖一時刺激了產米區的米價，但一待都市與產米區的米價平衡以後，便停止瘋狂式的上漲，如果今後果能消減投機囤積，價格一定能趨於穩定。準此而觀，國府對米糧的緊急措施，實在是非常賢明的舉助。</p>
<p>運銷現況</p>
<p>朱家角有米行六七家，戰前在青黃不接的時期每日仍可收米約二百石，現在雖開放米禁，因爲　農民願意有米，僅在需款時糶出存底也不甚豐厚，　現鈔貼水問題未解決，米行缺乏現鈔收米，所以每日每家米行不渦收米約二十有，這些米大都先運靑浦，然後　運來滬。</p>
<p>據記者估計，育浦運滬食米每日約在兩百石之譜，大部用卡車裝運，此外小汽本，塌車，自由車，掮販都有，運米者巨額的還推官商，有穿制服者押運。從朱家角運米至靑浦，利用水道，每石運費約兩千元；自靑浦城蓮米至滬利用公路，每石價約一萬八千元（七日漲至四萬），再加上落起駁以及免不了的沿途開銷，自朱家角至滬運費每石約三萬元。</p>
<p>記者調査時爲七月四·五兩日，當時當地米價：糙米每石約四十七萬元，白米約五十六萬元，是時上海同種米的價格在六十五萬元之譜，兩地差額約九萬元左右。（七月七日　靑浦白米每石價約六十一萬元。）</p>

<h3>保甲問題雜感</h3>
<p>— 魯風</p>
<p>本市市區保甲宣傳委員會委員新聞報總主筆魯風，於八日下午七時假上海電台，向全市民衆廣播，紀錄如次</p>
<p>各位聽衆：今日本人應市區保甲宣傳委員會之請，向各位談談保甲問題。本人亦爲上海市民之一份子，對保甲關係相當密切。查上海保甲工作，在事變後，乃爲實際成就之工作，頗著成績，但缺點亦在所難免，現二方而而談：</p>
<p>保甲工作兩點缺點</p>
<p>第一：為保甲當局及保甲工作人員之缺點，由於種種環境上之關係，難能令人充分滿意，在表面上，上海保甲工作確已收獲相當效果，但距理想境地尚遠</p>
<p>第二：則爲市民本身對保甲工作之認識不足，尤以市民之認識，在保甲工作上至爲重要，市民如有充分之認識，則保甲富局在領導上，便利非淺。故上海市民應深刻地認識保甲之任務，務必認質去幹。</p>
<p>因此，希望全市民衆，再不能敷衍了事，祗求形式。查上海保甲工作，在防空工作上，亦頗緊張，而防空工作必須通過保甲，例如最近之工作，如掘井，開挖防空壕等等，嚴格地言，能足供實用者究有多少，實則泰半零亂不堪，試問其效果如何？</p>
<p>協力當局負起責任</p>
<p>故每一市民對保甲任該負起責任，如保甲工作人員之態度不良，亦可向保甲當局告發料正，而本身對保甲工作，亦不可數衍了事，致誤人誤已也。故本人深望市民及保甲人員，對於該點，毅然加以檢討反省，餘如燈火管制時，不可任意洩光，如對此不認眞辦理，則直接影響保甲工作之不能推進，而受累仍爲本身。</p>
<p>此外最普遍之現象，因保甲手續麻煩，致一般人對當局深感不滿。故一　　盼望當局顧全市民，避免繁殖手續，而市民本身亦應時時注意，站在人民之立塲，應協力當局，科正缺點。否則，怨恨與無謂批評均馬徒然，從小的方面而言，乃爲保甲上之問題，大而言之，則實爲民族國民組織之低落。</p>
<p>今以上海市民之保甲工作，與在滬盟邦日本人民之保甲工作相，則　見不及遠甚。蓋彼等對當局之命令，嚴格執行外，而在演習上，更認眞去做，乃能使秩序整齊，而收獲美滿效果。反觀我國民衆，非但不認偵辦理，甚且敷衍塞責，故在保甲工作問題事小，而對國家民族影響事大。總之，如有缺點之處，應向當局建議改善，斯乃基本問題，今日本人對此特別强調。</p>
<p>執行義務始有權利</p>
<p>在當前戰局緊張之際，敵機隨時可來，難免有空襲危險。今後應當確切實幹，希望每一市民保障本身之生命，求得安居樂業，度過困難，則必重視保甲，決非推諉不負責任，要知權利義務，在執行義務後，始有權利，此爲最重要之一點。</p>
<p>社會服務衛生局兒童院定期舉行休業式</p>
<p>衛生局兒童院，定於本月十二日上午十時，舉行休業式，並於十二·十三·十四三天，公開招待各界參觀，届時有兒童成績展覽，每日下午四至六時，有遊藝表演。</p>
<p>該院僻處於常德路星嘉玻路一　，創立於卅年一月，在前工部局委託託救世軍辦理乞丐收容所時，僅爲丐童區，卅二年八目，由前第一區公署出資，另委女靑年會辯辦，改名兒童院，本月四月，始由衛生局收回自辦。</p>
<p>一般彼父母們遺棄的流浪街童，由警察局正俗科收來，經衛生局第六科轉送入兒童院中安插。由該院依各個兒童的賦性，分別敎導，使各成爲將來社會有用之才，這種工作在目前是非常的需要，也就是該院慘澹經營，苦心孤詣的成績。</p>

        <h1>1945 - n190</h1>
<h3>Northern Balikpapan City Streets: A Fierce Bayonet Charge Unfolds; Japanese Boat Unit Sinks Two Transport Ships</h3>
<p>From a Southern Frontline Base, 8th, Central News Agency: Enemy warships off the coast of Balikpapan currently consist of five cruisers, fifteen destroyers, and forty-five minesweepers and transport ships. Compared to the time of the landing, excluding auxiliary craft, they have already decreased by one-fifth of the total number. Furthermore, land battles are currently centered on the northern part of the city and areas near the airfield, where a fierce bayonet charge is unfolding. In recent days, Japanese forces have destroyed two enemy tents, killed or wounded over 150 enemy soldiers, prevented enemy forces from invading, and firmly defended the oil field area.</p>
<p>From a Southwest Pacific Base, 8th, Central News Agency: On the night of the 4th, Japanese armed boats in the Balikpapan area attacked enemy convoys in the port of Balikpapan, sinking a 3,000-ton transport ship and destroying an 8,000-ton transport ship.</p>
<h3>Situations in the Philippines, Burma, and Borneo; Enemy Warships Discovered at Nicobar</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 8th, Central News Agency: The latest war situations in various parts of Greater East Asia are as follows:</p>
<p>In the Philippines, the American 37th Division advancing north from the Salacsac-Barrela area and a portion of the 11th Division advancing south from the Abari area appear to have made contact around Zikega on approximately June 25th. As a result, it is now being proclaimed locally that the Luzon operation has concluded. However, Japanese forces in northern Luzon are still fighting fiercely in the mountains west of the Cagayan Valley and north of Baguio. Similarly, Japanese forces in the mountains east of Paniqui are continuing to fight.</p>
<p>In the Southwest Pacific, enemy forces attacking Balikpapan began landing on July 1st with 250 landing craft, with an initial force of approximately 7,000 men. They have gradually increased their numbers and now have approximately 15,000 men. The enemy's operation against Borneo, a resource-rich area, can be said to be their first engagement in what they call a favorable operation. Meanwhile, the air raids on Banjarmasin are gradually intensifying. On the 3rd and 4th, small numbers of planes launched fierce attacks.</p>
<p>In Burma, there have been no significant changes on the Burmese front. Japanese forces in the southeast of Mandalay are still securing the area near Pyawbwe and bravely fighting against the attacking enemy. Japanese forces in the Pegu mountain range are preventing the invading enemy from advancing. The enemy forces in the lower Sittang River area, consisting of approximately 20,000 men from the Indian 5th Division and the British 17th Division, with 50 tanks and approximately 120 artillery pieces, are currently attempting to cross the Sittang River and advance against the Japanese forces. However, as the area is currently in the rainy season, both sides' operations are being hampered. Nevertheless, the Japanese forces have high morale and are engaging in courageous combat.</p>
<p>In the Nicobar area, on July 6th, fourteen warships centered around two aircraft carriers were conducting reconnaissance in the Southeast Sea. However, no active movements were observed. The discovery of this new enemy fleet requires heightened vigilance.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Province Establishes Air Raid Disaster Relief Committee</h3>
<p>Hangzhou, 8th, Central News Agency: In order to meet wartime needs, the Zhejiang Provincial Government has specially established an Air Raid Disaster Relief Committee. It has now formulated various plans related to disaster prevention and relief and aims to strengthen air raid relief and defense efforts.</p>
<h3>Kanto and Kyushu Attacked Yesterday in Succession; B-29 Type Aircraft First Strike Nansei Islands</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 8th, Central News Agency: Approximately 150 enemy P-37 type aircraft from the Yellow Sea area, led by three B-29 type aircraft, attacked the Kanto region in three waves from 00:02 to 01:30 PM on the 8th, targeting military facilities and airfields in the Tokyo area and the Ibaraki-Boso region. Japanese losses were minor.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 8th, Central News Agency:</p>
<p>Enemy small aircraft units based in Okinawa operated south of Kikaijima and in the Tanegashima area at around 11:30 AM on the 7th. Separately, two PBM-type aircraft operated over eastern Miyazaki Prefecture and western Shikoku at 9:00 AM on the same day before escaping. Also, at around 2:30 PM on the same day, a formation of 13 P-41Y aircraft and approximately 20 PBM-type and PB4Y-type aircraft invaded from the Kikaijima area, targeting Sasebo and Hirado.</p>
<p>Central Pacific Base, 8th, Central News Agency: Over ten enemy B-20 type aircraft attacked Minamidaito Island during the day on the 7th. This marks the first attack on the island by B-29s.</p>
<h3>United States Establishes New Strategic Air Force</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 8th, Central News Agency: Following his inspection of Pacific bases, U.S. Air Force Chief General Arnold announced through U.S. Under Secretary of War Patterson on the 7th that a new Strategic Air Force has been established for the purpose of operations against Japan. General Spaatz, commander of the U.S. Air Force in Europe under Eisenhower, has been appointed as commander of the force. Under his command are the Eighth Air Force directly subordinate to Lieutenant General Doolittle and the Twentieth Air Force in the Marianas. Major General LeMay has also been promoted to commander of the Twentieth Air Force. Consequently, Spaatz will station himself in Okinawa alongside the Twentieth Air Force in the Marianas and oversee Doolittle's Eighth Air Force, attempting to intensify air raids on Japan through operations on two fronts. This reorganization of the U.S. Air Force reflects the importance of the strategic attack mission against Japan, given the massive air power consisting of one thousand B-29s in the Marianas and the nine hundred fighter-bombers already assembled in Okinawa. It highlights the urgent need for a unified commander. LeMay, the commander of the Twentieth Air Force, is known for his brutal bombings. His collaboration with Doolittle to bomb the Japanese mainland from two fronts is a scheme that reveals the American style and is deeply infuriating, further increasing the determination to annihilate the enemy. Since June 17th, enemy B-29s from the Marianas base have repeatedly bombed small and medium-sized cities on the Japanese mainland, affecting over twenty cities. The southern Kyushu region has been frequently attacked by North American B-25s and small aircraft from the Okinawa base. The Kanto region has been under continuous attacks in recent days by P-51s flying from Iwo Jima. As the enemy strengthens its air bombing formation against Japan, future attacks are expected to become more intense. This type of aerial assault is a prelude to a landing on the Japanese mainland. The enemy's air offensive suggests that a landing operation on the homeland is imminent. Therefore, the Japanese side must not only strive to prevent these attacks but also transform scorched earth into combat power as soon as possible to minimize the impact of the bombings. On the day of the enemy landing, a decisive victory must be achieved by further consolidating our defenses and patiently waiting for the opportunity.</p>
<h3>Boy Pilot</h3>
<p>Rain has been falling constantly around the base. It's been drizzling every day, it truly is the plum rain season! The air pressure is low near the Okinawa Islands, and dark clouds are constantly shifting in the sky. Despite the weather, special attack units are constantly taking off and landing, tirelessly preparing for future operations. When we arrived at this base, it was raining heavily, but shortly after, we saw several special attack aircraft landing safely despite the adverse weather conditions.</p>
<p>"Are there any graduates from the boy pilot program here?" A sergeant asked the "maintenance crew" (soldiers who service the aircraft) after getting out of a plane.</p>
<p>"Yes, over there."</p>
<p>The sergeant rushed towards the barracks. How happy it must be to meet old classmates! In the barracks, three corporals surrounded him, joyfully chatting. I couldn't hear what they were talking about, but I imagine they were pouring out their hearts to each other. The bond between those who came from the boy pilot program is different from that of ordinary schoolmates, it is especially pure.</p>
<h3>Cherry Blossoms Blooming Together on the Same Branch</h3>
<p>After entering the boy pilot school, the students receive several months of common education before being assigned to special skill training, with some entering flight courses, some entering mechanical courses, and some entering communications courses. Young men who have gathered together occasionally during those months often meet again in unexpected places after leaving school. For example, they might all be in a special attack unit and end up together. Now, surrounding the sergeant are Sergeant Muto of the maintenance crew, Sergeant Kihara of the fighter escort squadron, and Corporal Omura of the communications crew.</p>
<p>"Ah, you're doing this too? Sigh, if only I had entered the flight course when I was in school!"</p>
<p>"Don't say that. I'm about to take off, please make sure my plane is well maintained."</p>
<p>"If I can receive your successful telegram that says 'I have crashed into the aircraft carrier,' then my years of hard training will not have been in vain," said Corporal Omura.</p>
<p>"Are you in Lieutenant Nai's squadron? I'm in charge of providing cover! If enemy planes try to interfere, I will fight them to the death, whether it's Grumman or P-51 or P-47, so you can be sure to strike the enemy ship," said Corporal Kihara.</p>
<p>Special attack, maintenance, escort, and communications, these four classmates with different jobs are tightly united, stronger than steel.</p>
<p>"You and I are cherry blossoms blooming at the same time, flourishing on the branches of war. We will fall even more spectacularly, for the sake of the nation!" The four magnificent figures walked shoulder to shoulder towards the distance, disappearing beyond the vast airfield. That night, I had a dream all night long, dreaming of four cherry blossoms blooming densely together:</p>
<h3>Bearing the Fate of the Motherland</h3>
<p>Sergeant Muto of the maintenance crew stayed up all night, meticulously working on Sergeant Wu's plane. His bloodshot eyes were wide open, and he shined a flashlight to check it again and again, refusing to let go of even the smallest problem. At dawn, Sergeant Wu and other special attack team members lined up on the airfield, listening to the commander's instructions.</p>
<p>"The fate of the motherland rests entirely on your shoulders!" The commander shouted excitedly. Sergeant Wu and the others gripped their sword hilts tightly.</p>
<p>The time for departure had arrived. The plane's propellers were already spinning. Sergeant Kihara, who was in charge of providing cover, tightly grasped Sergeant Wu's hand. He said calmly, "I wish you success!" Then, they each boarded their planes. Corporals Omura and Muto waved their hats to see off Sergeant Wu and his colleagues. With a roar, one plane after another disappeared into the southern sky in an instant.</p>
<h3>A Blood-Red Spark</h3>
<p>Sergeant Wu stared ahead, gripping the control stick tightly. Just as he flew not far from his destination, more than a dozen black dots suddenly appeared in front of him.</p>
<p>"Enemy planes!" Sergeant Wu couldn't help but bite his lip.</p>
<p>At this moment, several black shadows suddenly swept across the sky above. It turned out to be friendly fighters, and they were waving their wings, sending a signal.</p>
<p>"Kihara, I'm counting on you!" Sergeant Wu couldn't help but shout.</p>
<p>Friendly fighters gathered into a group and charged fiercely into the enemy plane group, immediately shooting down five or six of them, scattering the enemy planes.</p>
<p>At this moment, the radio received a telegram calling Sergeant Wu's plane. It must have been Corporal Omura sending it from the base. However, Sergeant Wu did not reply for the time being. Before long, the target was in sight. The special attack team changed its formation.</p>
<p>"Divine aircraft, charge towards the target!" Captain Nai issued the signal.</p>
<p>At this time, enemy fighters broke through the escorting defense line and flew in from all directions to attack Sergeant Wu. The enemy's anti-aircraft fire also fired wildly. However, Sergeant Wu ignored everything, passed through the fire net, avoided the enemy planes, and quietly searched for his target. At sea, there were battleships, cruisers, and aircraft carriers. Sergeant Wu selected a target and began his attack. At this moment, a friendly plane flew by his side, waving its wings. It turned out to be Sergeant Kihara's plane.</p>
<p>"Kihara, thank you!" At the same time, Sergeant Wu's left hand gently pressed the transmission key, sending a telegram back to the base saying, "I have crashed into the aircraft carrier."</p>
<p>Enemy fighters were closely chasing him on both sides, and Sergeant Kihara tried his best to scatter them, clearing a bloody path for Sergeant Wu. It was time. The control stick tilted smoothly to the right, and Sergeant Wu's plane began to dive rapidly like a bullet. The speed became faster and faster, and the enemy aircraft carrier in front of him became bigger and bigger. The last scene reflected in Sergeant Wu's wide eyes was a flash of bright red light.</p>
<p>This was my dream. The reality must have been even more tragic. Since the Battle of Leyte Gulf, many special attack team members have been martyred for their country in this way. Their greatness is something we should remember. (Report by Ojima news team, translated from the Mainichi Shimbun, June 8th)</p>
<h3>New Station Built Near Maoshan, Wuhu</h3>
<p>Wuhu, 8th, Central News Agency: To facilitate passengers on the Nanjing-Wuhu Railway line, the Central China Railway Company previously surveyed the area near Maoshan in this county for the construction of a new station.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Great Significance of Air Raid Drills</h3>
<p>Today is again the regularly scheduled air raid drill, and the authorities have announced the six major objectives of this drill, which will be earnestly implemented. Looking back at the results of the past eighteen drills, to be honest, we do not see any particular achievements. The authorities and those who are ordered to participate in the drills do sweat and work hard to earnestly practice, but most citizens still go their own way. Only a few are able to automatically cooperate and abide by the rules. However, we must clearly recognize that air raid drills are not just acting. The performers perform, and the audience watches. The greatest requirement is to enable all citizens to develop automatic habits. If we look at it from this standard, the past eighteen drills seem to have many unsatisfactory aspects.</p>
<p>Furthermore, air raid drills are a collective action, that is, a planned and organized action. The good or bad results of this action directly reflect whether the society is organized. If drills are forever just drills, and the general public is indifferent, at most only reluctantly perfunctory under the leadership of the authorities, then this merely exposes our society's lack of organization, disorganization, and weakness. If this state of society is allowed to continue, how can we talk about future national reconstruction and development? Therefore, we must regard air raid drills as a test of our social organizational capacity, and the results of each drill must be better than the previous one.</p>
<p>Air raid drills today are also a major test of civic virtue. Taking the prevention of light leakage as an example, according to the regulations, if any household or room is found to have light leakage, the power supply to that household and its surrounding block will be cut off depending on the circumstances. This means that one person's failure to abide by the rules will affect the majority of people nearby. Those who have civic virtue will naturally not fail to abide by the rules. To expand on this, because one person's carelessness can affect the public, those who have civic virtue must not only be careful and cautious themselves but also be aware of whether their neighbors are violating air raid laws. In this way, air raid drills can be said to be a measure that embodies civic virtue. We hope that citizens will have a proper understanding of this.</p>
<p>Any movement requires leaders to set an example, and air defense is no exception. However, we often see light leakage in the buildings of many public institutions. Although we do not want to list their real names, the general public is very clear about this. If we think that we are government agencies and can disregard air defense rules, then what is the negative impact on the psychology of the general public? Furthermore, although government officials themselves understand the importance of abiding by air defense rules, they may not always inspect and supervise their family members and servants. As a result, there are often violations of air defense rules. We hope that government agencies, especially government officials, will pay special attention to this.</p>
<p>We believe that air raid drills, in addition to their own significance, also have the important significance of building hearts and minds and reforming social customs. In addition to the three points mentioned above, during this summer season, we also hope that the general public will adhere to the habit of going to bed early and getting up early, preferably not using electric lights at all in the evening. Those who usually play cards and dance under electric lights will be able to slowly realize that life is more meaningful if they can practice getting up early and going to bed early, saving countless wasted time and increasing beneficial factors for both body and mind. This is very beneficial for oneself, for society, and for the country.</p>
<h3>Proclamation of War by the National Government</h3>
<p>On December 8th of the year before last, at the start of the Greater East Asia War, the National Government, in accordance with the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty, declared its determination to share weal and woe with friendly nation Japan. Since then, it has embarked on the New National Movement, engaged in safeguarding public security, and improved the people's livelihood, with the aim of enhancing national strength and assisting in the completion of the Greater East Asia War. However, Britain and the United States continue to use their centuries-old policy of dividing East Asia, and have even intensified it, colluding with elements of the Chongqing faction to participate in the so-called Anglo-American front, sending troops to Burma and India to have East Asians slaughter each other. Recently, their violence has been successively defeated by the Japanese army, navy, and air force, and their bases for aggression in East Asia have been lost. They are increasingly resorting to cunning schemes, and are jealous of the peaceful development of the National Government's controlled areas, instigating Chongqing faction elements to constantly harass and hinder the progress of various construction projects, and directly using their own aircraft, based in Chongqing, to repeatedly bomb Wuhan, Guangzhou, and other places, harming civilians. The Chongqing faction elements, willingly driven by Britain and the United States, acting as traitors to East Asia, are indeed shameful. However, Britain and the United States, with their long-standing and deliberate plotting against East Asia, have exhausted their ability to provoke and sow discord, in order to ultimately fulfill their desire for annexation. This is something that East Asian nations should jointly resist with hatred. The National Government hereby declares that, from today onwards, it is in a state of war with Britain and the United States, and will exert all its strength to cooperate with friendly nation Japan to sweep away the brutality of Britain and the United States, in order to seek the revival of China and the liberation of East Asia. The nations of Manchukuo and Thailand have long maintained friendly relations, and share a common desire for East Asian co-prosperity. In the future, they will increasingly seek to support each other, in order to jointly build a new East Asian order based on righteousness. The friendly nations of Germany and Italy have been engaged in a struggle with the forces of Britain and the United States in the West for several years, and have repeatedly achieved glorious victories. Our nation's participation in the Greater East Asia War will resonate with them, in order to contribute to a just new order for the entire world. All our citizens should know that this is the only opportunity to realize the Father of the Nation's Greater Asianism. The revival of the Republic of China, the realization of Greater East Asian construction, and the attainment of justice and peace for the entire world all depend on this. They must be of one heart and one mind, and work diligently from beginning to end, in order to carry out this great mission of this great era. January 9th, the thirty-second year of the Republic of China. Chairman Wang Zhaoming.</p>
<p>Suburban Correspondence</p>
<h3>Lifting of Rice Ban and Tang Yi of Zhujiajiao</h3>
<p>Since the National Government implemented emergency measures regarding rice, lifted the rice ban, and stopped purchasing, although the price of rice in Shanghai has seen a decline, the price of rice in the interior has instead increased. Regarding this measure of restoring free circulation of rice, people are quite interested in what kind of impact it will have on the future price of rice. Therefore, we specially visited Qingpu and Zhujiajiao, the sources of rice, to infer the future trend from the discussion of the rice transportation and sales prices of the land.</p>
<p>Before and After the Lifting of the Ban</p>
<p>First, before the rice was restored to free circulation, the price of rice in Shanghai and Qingpu was vastly different, usually differing by more than one-third. Therefore, although it was nominally under control, merchants still smuggled it to Shanghai. Second, some farmers still had surplus rice in storage. After the ban was lifted, farmers dared to transport three or five shi to the towns of Qingpu or Zhujiajiao. Therefore, the lifting of the rice ban did not deplete the local rice reserves. Third, according to the past situation, the price of rice in Shanghai was higher than in Qingpu city, and Qingpu was higher than Zhujiajiao. Although this has not changed in general, when the price of rice in Shanghai declined, Qingpu was the first to fall. The market in Zhujiajiao is not as active as in Qingpu town, so sometimes it is higher than the price in the city. The above three points illustrate that the main driving force behind the rise in the price of rice in Shanghai in the past was artificial obstruction and speculation, and not entirely due to the lack of rice. The price in the rice-producing area followed the price in Shanghai, and it was not that the price in the producing area rose and affected the price in Shanghai. Although free circulation and the cessation of purchases temporarily stimulated the price of rice in the rice-producing area, once the price of rice in the city and the rice-producing area were balanced, the frantic rise stopped. If speculation and hoarding can be reduced in the future, the price will definitely tend to stabilize. Based on this, the National Government's emergency measures for rice are indeed very wise measures.</p>
<p>Current Status of Transportation and Sales</p>
<p>There are six or seven rice shops in Zhujiajiao. Before the war, even during the lean months, they could still collect about 200 shi of rice per day. Now, although the rice ban has been lifted, because farmers are reluctant to part with their rice, they only sell some of their reserves when they need money, and the reserves are not very abundant. Also, because the problem of cash discounts has not been resolved, rice shops lack cash to purchase rice. Therefore, each rice shop collects only about 20 shi of rice per day. Most of this rice is first transported to Qingpu, and then transported to Shanghai.</p>
<p>According to the reporter's estimate, about 200 shi of edible rice are transported from Yuipu to Shanghai every day, mostly transported by trucks. In addition, there are small gasoline trucks, flatbed trucks, bicycles, and porters. Those who transport rice in large quantities also include government merchants, with people in uniform escorting the rice. The transportation fee from Zhujiajiao to Qingpu by waterway is about 2,000 yuan per shi. The price from Qingpu city to Shanghai via the highway is about 18,000 yuan per shi (rising to 40,000 yuan on the 7th). Adding the loading and unloading costs and the inevitable expenses along the way, the transportation fee from Zhujiajiao to Shanghai is about 30,000 yuan per shi.</p>
<p>The reporter's investigation was on July 4th and 5th. At that time, the local price of rice was: about 470,000 yuan per shi for brown rice, and about 560,000 yuan for white rice. At that time, the price of the same type of rice in Shanghai was about 650,000 yuan, a difference of about 90,000 yuan between the two places. (On July 7th, the price of white rice in Qingpu was about 610,000 yuan per shi.)</p>

<h3>Today is the 19th Air Defense Day, Training Exercises to be Carried Out as Usual, Six Major Exercises to be Held Throughout the District</h3>
<p>Today is the 19th Air Defense Day. The Municipal Air Defense Headquarters will carry out various air defense training exercises as usual. The time for issuing the daily training alarm has been reported in yesterday's newspaper. At that time, sirens will not be sounded during the alarm time. The method of communication has been specially planned in advance, such as using bicycles, gongs, and oral communication. As for the main training exercises in the whole district, they are divided into six major goals to be implemented: comprehensive training in designated areas, emergency evacuation training, alarm communication training, cleaning and rectification of air-raid shelters, local training, and implementation of blackout training. At that time, every radio station in Shanghai will also broadcast air defense programs from time to time, hoping that the citizens will listen to them.</p>
<p>Points to Note for Air Defense Training</p>
<p>The following matters should be noted in this air defense training: First goal, comprehensive training in designated areas, in the air defense jurisdiction of each police precinct, designate one district or two Lianbao (joint guarantee units) to implement comprehensive training during the training time, and implement it thoroughly in the designated training area and its surroundings in accordance with the training after receiving the radio broadcast assuming comprehensive training is implemented. Thoroughly implement traffic control, such as broadcasting that a simulated wave attack is in progress. Repeatedly hold air defense activities and waiting exercises, and finally implement emergency evacuation training.</p>
<p>Second goal emergency evacuation training. Designate in advance open spaces that can accommodate and protect refugees, or buildings considered safe, and training areas. Each household selects one or more trainees for refuge training, for a total of about five or six people. The route for the refugee trainees is instructed in advance. The refugees carrying the training must carry food for one or two uses, and all other items are prohibited. In addition, in order to prevent the thick smoke in case of fire, personnel engaged in general air defense activities must prepare towels to cover their mouths and noses before taking action. In addition, in order to organize and guide those who are urgently evacuating, mobilize a large number of police and members of the Baojia self-defense corps to maintain order at the scene, and use guidance flags within the possible range.</p>
<p>Third target for communication and reporting training. Each air defense jurisdiction is the unit, and each police department issues orders based on the training implementation time. Plan the communication method in advance and quickly transmit it to the relevant organizations of civil air defense. This training does not sound the alarm siren, but in the event of an actual air raid, a gasoline alarm will be used. In the transmission of orders, try to consider using bicycles, and expect the activities of Baojia's self-defense corps. At the same time as the sound of gongs, oral communication must also be used, calling the phrase "training", and the whole area will universally implement the training alarm flag, to identify it.</p>
<p>Fourth goal is to clean up and adjust the air defense team to mobilize the fourth team of the shocking Bureau's police general team to carry out model adjustment work on the main roads. During the adjustment of air defense, each district sub-bureau chief must consult with the air defense headquarters. For the existing air defense trenches that are obstructive, they should be abolished, and the general public will complete it on the day of the Noo according to the cleaning of the air defense trenches and the adjustment methods.</p>
<p>Fifth target, local training, designated as the four air defense jurisdictions of Tilan Bridge, Yulin Road, Yangshupu, and Xinshi Street. It will be implemented in the morning, and in the afternoon, it will be implemented according to the city's training plan.</p>
<p>Sixth target, blackout training. The Civil Air Defense Headquarters broadcasts general information about fire control by radio. If there are areas with poor lighting control, residents in the area will be urged to pay attention. The lighting control supervision team is formed by the police and Baojia. In addition to earnest guidance, it will also strictly enforce it. And each battalion inspection branch dispatched two or three classes to implement supervision of vehicle lighting control in the city. The lighting control of small boats on the Huangpu River and Suzhou River is implemented by the water police for guidance and supervision.</p>

<h3>Last Week's Financial, Industrial, and Market Conditions in This City, Idle Funds are Still Moving Restlessly</h3>
<p>The recent week's trend of financial, industrial, and market conditions in Shanghai is strangely shaped, and the achievement is not uniform. Under this complex current situation, idle funds are active, without standards, especially within a week, the Central Reserve has improved the financial related bills use measures, the public was initially affected, did not dare to move, the city showed, in the second half of the week due to various rumors, the market merchants were prosperous, the wind suddenly rose</p>
<p>Black Market</p>
<p>The black market has come to an intangible halt due to the opening of the gold certificate market. Starting on the first day of the week, the gold certificates were listed and auctioned. The maturity (periods 1 and 2) and the third and fourth periods were very lively in buying and selling. The opening market price was still stable, and there was little difference compared to the black market price. On Tuesdays and Wednesdays, the number of transactions gradually increased. On Thursday, due to some kind of flow of encouragement, buyers were absorbed very hard, and the rise suddenly vibrated from this, with each ten taels rushing out of the 30 million yuan mark. Transactions were extremely prosperous. On Fridays and Saturdays, the market price remained high. The maturity bond rose to 3.33 million yuan per tael, and the third and fourth period bonds were seen at 3.22 million yuan to 3.16 million yuan. Silver and public bonds were also steadily increasing.</p>
<p>Chinese Stocks</p>
<p>Chinese stocks were continuing to fall on the first three days of the week. On Thursday, due to the sharp loosening of silver, gold certificates rose sharply. The bulls absorbed with all their strength, and retail investors also followed up and bought. The auctioned price gradually increased. Within two hours of the market opening, the three popular stocks of Mei Ya and Company Yarn Factory, and small and medium-sized stocks generally rose to the limit. On Friday, because the holders still had no intention of getting rid of their goods, the market recovered strongly. Before the market closed, the market was weak due to the bulls throwing out. On Saturday, after the rise, it fell again, then rose again, and hovered up and down all day long, but the foundations were solid.</p>
<p>Prices</p>
<p>As for industry and commerce, industry is still unable to increase production due to power relations. Prices of silk, cotton textiles, and daily necessities continue to rise. Rice has been stable in the past week, and the source continues to be uninterrupted. Although the quantity is not abundant, the people's food can be temporarily maintained in its current state. Prices of miscellaneous grains and oil grains have risen slightly due to the soaring price of gold. At this time of year when the old harvest is exhausted and the new harvest has not yet arrived, it is not easy to suppress the current prices of food and daily necessities. The authorities attach great importance to this. Hoarding and speculation will be strictly prohibited.</p>

<h3>Random Thoughts on the Baojia System</h3>
<p>— Lu Feng</p>
<p>Mr. Lu Feng, chief writer of the "Xinwen Bao" and member of the Shanghai Municipal Baojia Propaganda Committee, broadcasted to all citizens from the Shanghai Radio Station at 7:00 PM on the 8th. The following is a transcript:</p>
<p>Fellow listeners: Today, at the invitation of the Municipal Baojia Propaganda Committee, I will be discussing the Baojia system. As a citizen of Shanghai, I am closely connected to the Baojia system. Upon inspection, the Shanghai Baojia work, after the incident (likely referring to the war), has achieved practical results and considerable success, but shortcomings are unavoidable. Now, let's discuss it from two perspectives:</p>
<p>Two Shortcomings of the Baojia Work</p>
<p>First: The shortcomings of the Baojia authorities and Baojia workers. Due to various environmental factors, it is difficult to fully satisfy people. On the surface, Shanghai's Baojia work has indeed achieved considerable results, but it is still far from the ideal state.</p>
<p>Second: The citizens themselves lack sufficient understanding of the Baojia work. The understanding of the citizens is particularly important for the Baojia work. If the citizens have a full understanding, it will greatly facilitate the leadership of the Baojia Bureau. Therefore, the citizens of Shanghai should deeply understand the mission of the Baojia and must recognize its essence and work diligently.</p>
<p>Therefore, I hope that all citizens will no longer be perfunctory and only seek formality. Upon inspection, the Shanghai Baojia work is also quite tense in terms of air defense work, and air defense work must be carried out through the Baojia. For example, recent works such as well digging and the excavation of air raid shelters, strictly speaking, how many can actually be used? In fact, most of them are in disarray. How can we expect them to be effective?</p>
<p>Authorities Should Take Responsibility</p>
<p>Therefore, every citizen should take responsibility for the Baojia. If the attitude of the Baojia workers is bad, you can report it to the Baojia authorities for correction. You yourselves should not be perfunctory about the Baojia work, lest you mislead others and harm yourselves. Therefore, I sincerely hope that citizens and Baojia personnel will resolutely review and reflect on this point. In addition, when traffic controls of lights are being implemented, you should not arbitrarily leak light. If you do not handle this seriously, it will directly affect the inability to promote the Baojia work, and those who suffer will still be yourselves.</p>
<p>In addition, the most common phenomenon is that the Baojia procedures are cumbersome, which makes the general public deeply dissatisfied with the authorities. Therefore, I hope that the authorities will take care of the citizens and avoid breeding procedures. The citizens themselves should always pay attention, stand in the position of the people, and cooperate with the authorities to correct shortcomings. Otherwise, resentment and meaningless criticism are in vain. From a small point of view, it is a problem with the Baojia; from a larger point of view, it is the decline of the national organization.</p>
<p>Comparing the Baojia work of Shanghai citizens with the Baojia work of the Allied Japanese people in Shanghai, we see that we are far behind. They not only strictly implement the orders of the authorities, but also take the exercises seriously, which enables them to maintain order and achieve satisfactory results. On the other hand, our citizens not only do not handle things seriously, but even perfunctorily shirk their responsibilities. Therefore, the Baojia work is a small matter, but its impact on the country and the nation is a big matter. In short, if there are shortcomings, you should suggest improvements to the authorities. This is the basic problem. Today, I want to emphasize this in particular.</p>
<p>Rights Begin With Performing Obligations</p>
<p>At a time when the current war situation is tense, enemy planes can come at any time, and there is an unavoidable danger of air raids. In the future, we should do things thoroughly and practically. I hope that every citizen will protect their own lives, seek to live and work in peace and contentment, and overcome difficulties. We must attach importance to the Baojia and never shirk responsibility. We must know that rights and obligations, rights only come after performing obligations. This is one of the most important points.</p>
<p>The Social Service and Health Bureau's Children's Home Will Hold a Regular Closing Ceremony</p>
<p>The Children's Home of the Health Bureau is scheduled to hold a closing ceremony at 10:00 AM on the 12th of this month and will be open to the public for tours on the 12th, 13th, and 14th. There will be an exhibition of children's achievements, and performances will be held from 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM every day.</p>
<p>The institute is located at an address on Changde Road and Xingjia Po Road, and was founded in January of the 30th year [likely of the Republic, i.e., 1941]. When the former Public Works Department commissioned the Salvation Army to run a beggar shelter, it was only a beggar children's area. In August of the 32nd year [1943], it was funded by the former First District Office and commissioned to be run by the YWCA, renaming it the Children's Home. In April of this month, it was taken back and run by the Health Bureau.</p>
<p>Generally, wandering street children abandoned by their parents are taken in by the Police Bureau's Rehabilitation Section and transferred to the Children's Home by the Health Bureau's Sixth Section. The institute provides guidance according to the individual children's aptitudes, so that they can become useful talents in the future society. This kind of work is very necessary at present, and it is also the achievement of the institute's arduous management and painstaking efforts.</p>
<h3>The China Leprosy Association Hopes For Final Donations</h3>
<p>The China Leprosy Relief Association's current fundraising campaign has raised 14.88 million yuan as of today, exceeding the original target by nearly 5 million yuan. The excellent results are beyond expectations. However, the cost of living has risen, and current prices are four or five times higher than when fundraising began. To make up for this, a minimum of 20 million yuan is required. Therefore, we specifically appeal to all sectors to make a final effort to complete this task. If you would like to donate, you can send it directly to the association at No. 53, Lane 613, Jing'an Temple Road, telephone 126563.</p>

<h3>Regulations for Collecting Student Fees from Private Primary and Secondary Schools</h3>
<p>In order to stabilize the lives of teachers and staff in private schools in the city and to take into account the free admission of poor students, the Municipal Education Bureau, in light of the current social situation, has formulated the Interim Measures for Collecting Student Fees and Paying Teachers and Staff in Private Secondary Schools in Shanghai Special Municipality, starting from the 34th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1945]. The measures have been submitted to the Municipal Government for approval and have been ordered to be implemented by all private schools. The measures are recorded below:</p>
<p>Private primary and secondary schools, kindergartens, and equivalent schools (hereinafter referred to as each school) in Shanghai Special Municipality shall collect student fees and pay salaries to teachers and staff in accordance with these measures, starting from the 34th year (i.e., starting from August of the 34th year).</p>
<p>The amount of student fees collected by each school per semester shall be determined by the principal in consultation with the school board, taking into account the previous semester's fees and the economic conditions of most students' families. Payment methods shall be determined in installments and reported to the Municipal Education Bureau (hereinafter referred to as the Bureau) for record.</p>
<p>Each school shall comply with the order of the Ministry of Education and shall not collect rice or use rice as a means of payment for tuition fees. If the Bureau verifies that any school does not comply with the above order, it shall report to the Municipal Government for punishment.</p>
<p>The school board of each school shall be fully responsible for planning expenses and shall not use tuition revenue as the entire operating expense of each school.</p>
<p>Each school shall set up free places in accordance with the order of the Ministry of Education for students from poor families and staff serving in the education and cultural fields, or children of civil servants below the rank of appointee. From the 34th year, the free places for secondary schools shall not be less than 15% of the total number of students in the school, and the free places for primary schools shall not be less than 20% of the total number of students in the school.</p>
<p>If each secondary school has equipment such as trial or practical materials and libraries and sports facilities, it may collect appropriate fees as needed, but shall not transfer them to other uses.</p>
<p>Kindergartens and kindergartens attached to primary schools may collect snack fees, and the amount shall be determined according to the quality of snacks provided.</p>
<p>Each secondary school may collect handout fees as needed.</p>
<p>Each school may collect boarding fees and meal fees for students who board and dine, but shall organize a dining committee to be responsible for handling them.</p>
<p>Each school shall not collect living subsidies for teachers and staff from students, or solicit funds under other similar names.</p>
<p>The salary paid to full-time teachers and staff in each school shall be calculated on the basis of six full months per semester.</p>
<p>The distribution of teachers' and staff salaries in each school shall account for at least 70% of the total operating expenses and shall be paid on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>Before the end of the third school month of each semester, each school shall submit a register of the names, grades, and number of free students at all levels, as well as the revenue and expenditure situation, to the Bureau for submission to the Municipal Government for transmission to the Ministry of Education for verification.</p>
<p>Each school shall refer to the regulations of the Ministry of Education on primary and secondary schools and the principal shall inform the full-time teachers to publicly elect three to five people to form an expense audit committee, and the members shall take turns serving as chairpersons to be responsible for auditing the revenue and expenditure accounts, holding meetings once a month, and submitting a list of the members to the Bureau for record within one month after the start of the school year.</p>
<p>These interim measures may be amended at any time if there are any omissions.</p>
<p>These interim measures shall be implemented upon approval by the Shanghai Special Municipal Government and shall be transmitted to the Ministry of Education for record.</p>
