<h3>航空總攻擊繼續進行　日軍收獲大戰果　冲繩本島南部陣綫無變化</h3>
<p>前綫基地三十日中央社電　自二十七日深夜開始之航空總攻擊，二十八日仍繼續進行，向中城海敵艦船攻擊，自上午一時開始至九時許止，隨有直接掩護機之振武特攻隊，全體突入蝟集於該灣之敵艦船羣，確認戰果爲擊沉破四艘以上。又二十八日薄暮，自基地出發之特攻隊，亦對空母或大型巡洋艦一艘，驅逐艦一艘，艦種不詳者四艘勇猛突入，收獲極大戰果。</p>
<p>南西羣島基地三十日中央社電　冲繩本島南部地區首里，那　前戰綫無大變化。日航空部隊對冲繩附近敵艦船不斷攻擊，自二十九日夜至三十日晨不斷攻擊，逐次接獲「突入敵艦船」，「全機突入」等報告，敵機空襲南西諸島方面，二十九日冲繩本島僅三十架，石垣島六十架而已。</p>
<p>中城灣內艦船轟沉二十一艘</p>
<p>前綫基地三十日中央社電　日振武特攻隊及海軍雷擊隊，二十七·八兩日對集於中城灣急於補給發陸之敵艦船羣猛加攻擊。據現地軍及直接戰鬥機確認，轟沉艦種不詳者六艘，大型砲艦十三艘，中型砲艦二艘，此外並有許多火柱。</p>
<p>前綫基地三十日中央社電　伊江島飛機塲，過去以B29型機爲主，但最近並出現少數之中型機，二十四日深夜，因日義烈空挺部隊實行奇襲，喪失北·中兩飛機塲基地之F4F巨人型機，似有遷地之勢，伊江島飛機塲僅留敵機一百五十架，其中半數爲F4F型，其餘爲P51型。</p>
<h3>日軍守備部隊　施陣前反擊　特攻空挺隊呼應奮戰</h3>
<p>東京三十日中央社電　冲繩本島數軍，自二十一日以來已歷八日，藉猛烈砲火掩護，以陸軍部隊四師，海兵隊三師，共計七師團之大軍，集中於第一綫，執抝實行攻擊，該方面日軍守備隊，迭以巧妙之陣前反擊，敵軍之企國仍彼挫折，刻兩軍於對峙綫一進一退，無大變化。日守備隊死守自東海岸與那原南方，首里北方至那覇之陣綫，繼續奮戰中。又於二十四日夜降落於北·中飛機塲之義烈空挺部隊，其後經過四畫夜，受敵重圍，繼續勇敢血戰，使敵基地空軍之活動受阻止，日守備隊亦堅守原防，同時，特攻飛行隊與義烈空挺除之奮戰相呼應，乘氣候回復之良機，自二十八日晨對本島周邊之敵艦船羣展開壯烈之强襲作戰，由於義烈空挺部隊之奮戰，敵軍已受嚴重打擊，故迎擊之敵機數顯著減少。同時特攻隊之作戰效率極爲良好，逐漸收獲偉大戰果，因日空陸一體之善謀勇戰，敵軍之制壓冲繩本島企圖，至少限度於過去一週問已陷於膠着狀態。其陸上·海上所蒙之重創，永無止境，敵作戰指導部之焦慮，亦由之漸見濃化。於二十八日中，日特攻隊對敵艦船攻擊之狀况如下：上午七時十分至八時間，日特攻機大編隊殆未受敵戰鬥機之妨害，對本島周邊海上敵艦船實行突擊，獲得偉大戰果，繼於下午七時十分至七時十二分間，特攻隊編隊急襲本爲東方海域敵艦船，據報告對空母或巡洋艦衝撞者一架，對驅逐艦衝撞一架，對不詳者四架，其他各機亦各自尋求目標，實行衝撞。</p>
<p>英被海軍參加作戰</p>
<p>南西羣島基地三十日中央社電　因日特攻隊之猛攻，冲繩方面敵美機動部隊爲補充力量不足起見，乃動員英國艦隊，在冲繩各島擔任接濟護衛之責。該艦隊因日特攻隊之猛攻，極爲恐懼，遂自該島一帶遁去，現在又有美國艦隊與多量輸送船於該方面出現，積極補充兵員，惟因不能登陸，現於海上往來飄蕩。</p>
<p>瑞典京城三十日中央社電　倫敦來電，倫敦波闌流亡政府當局二十八日發表稱，波蘭政府海軍部隊於英海軍司令部之作戰指導下，已開始對日作戰。</p>
<p>襲京濱區敵機墜毀九十架</p>
<p>東京三十日中央社電　日方邀擊二十九日上午來襲京濱地區之敵B29　型機約五百架及P51型機約一百架，經調查判明戰果如次：擊落B29型機二十架，擊毀者四十九架，擊落P51型十二架，擊毀者九架。</p>
<h3>日海軍省發表神風隊功勳　豐田前長官布吿全軍</h3>
<p>東京三十日中央社電　日海軍省頃公布豐田前聯合艦隊司令長官布告全軍稱：自去年十月下旬，於雷伊泰島開始作戰起，迄此次冲繩周國作戰止，其間出擊之海軍神風特攻隊員，計共四百五十三名，藉此公布，各方乃得知悉各特攻隊之出擊情形，茲錄各隊隊名及建功處所如下：大和·櫻花·梅花·白此·時宗·聖武·正行·山本·朱雀·高德·笠置·吉野·右近·春日·櫻井·千早各隊，自昭和十九年十月二十七日，迄同年十二月七日間，於雷伊泰島周圍，塔羅般，巴伊巴伊各地戰鬥。神風·强風·怒濤·颱風·第一草薙各隊，自昭和十九年十一月二十五日起，迄同年十二月十五日間，於雷伊泰島，克斯威水道各地戰鬥。金剛隊自昭和十九年十二月十一日起，迄昭和二十年一月六日開，於斯立高海峽，喜基浩爾島附近，那蘇附近，明多羅島海面，羅般島西方海面戰鬥。旭日隊自昭和二十年一月三日迄七日，於斯立高海峽，仁牙因灣內及伊巴海面戰鬥。零戰隊百昭和二十年一月二十一日，於台灣附近戰鬥。第二御盾隊自昭和二十年二月二十一日迄同年三月一日於硫黃島戰鬥。菊水，梓各隊，昭和二十年三月十一日於島爾西戰鬥。第一筑波，第一第二七生，第一神劍各隊，昭和二十年四月上旬，於琉球羣島東方海面戰鬥。第一昭和，第二筑波，第二神劍各隊，昭和二十年四月中旬，於冲繩本島東方海面上戰鬥，對於敵機動部隊施行必死必中之肉彈攻擊，建立赫赫功勛，殊堪表楊，用特將其殊勛布告全軍週知。</p>
<h3>首都昨空襲　毀美機四架</h3>
<p>南京三十日中央社電　美駐渝空軍P51型六架，三十日上午十時十五分來襲南京，向市內之一部份施行機槍掃射，日制空部隊於空戰中擊落其一架，擊毀其三架。</p>
<h3>軍令部明日　正式成立</h3>

<p>廣州三十日中央社電　二十八日重慶廣播：駐昆明美軍補給指揮官齊浦斯少將，此次調任回國其後任由前諾曼第基地美軍司令官歐蘭特中將繼任</p>
<h3>奉公十則　鈴木首相座右銘</h3>
<p>「埋吾老軀於國民諸君最前列！」慷慨高呼的鈴水貫太郎大將，自出任首相以來，至五月七日止，已有一個月。此時期內，冲繩等前綫，純忠的是日本靑年正以血肉和生命築成了衛國的長城，然而歐洲的情勢却完全激變了。擧世正在這個　渦中狂舞，踏着這個波濤的鈴木首相，在此一個月內，是如何奮鬥的呢？一言以蔽之，鈴木首相是在實踐其自撰的「奉公十則」之一，即：「易事讓人，難事自當。」這在以節想必就已實行，但從誓與一億國民共同作戰時起，鈴木首相在以往的一個月間却每日奉行這條規律。</p>
<p>五月二日淸晨，接到希特勒戰死的情報時，鈴木首相的眉毛動也不動。</p>
<p>「由於歐洲的變化，一般國民的信念切不可動搖。我們要跨越戰友之屍前進！」他用「跨越戰友之屍」來表現日本對其盟邦元首歿後的態度。這點與「埋吾老軀於國民諸君最前列」的覺悟，是共通的。希特勒元首的英魂，可說已在鈴木首相那裏找到了知己。</p>
<p>二日傍晚，鈴木首相似乎想到了什麽，呼其姪鈴木武秘書官，打開「軍艦宗谷」這一本書，指着某頁道：</p>
<p>「我七十餘年的生涯，就是努力這個，今後也打算如此奉公。」</p>
<p>自撰自書奉公十則</p>
<p>那頁上，載有鈴木首相任練習艦隊司令官時於明治四十三年在「宗谷」艦上訓示靑年少尉候補生的「奉公十訓」。它是鈴木首相自撰自書的，內容如下：</p>
<p>不可以窮達變節</p>
<p>常修德磨智，於日常事中求學問與心；：應以公正各私為旨，脫却名利心。</p>
<p>應以共同和諧為旨，常存愛敬之念。</p>
<p>應言行一致，實踐先行於議論。</p>
<p>應注意保持身體健全。</p>
<p>應明曉法令，誠實遵守。</p>
<p>嚴守己職，尊重人職。</p>
<p>應自知能力，不可驕慢。</p>
<p>易事讓人，難事自當。</p>
<p>心應常保靜謐，雖臨危急，猶應注意維持沈着態度。</p>
<p>鈴木武秘書官恭讀十訓，至第九則「易事讓人，難事自當」時，不覺恍然而悟。這是七十九歲老宰相的奉公信念。</p>
<p>「拜受大命的心事，定在此處！」鈴木武氏至此方悟伯父貫太郎大將的心底秘密。而爲了堅持此戰起見，稱「不懂政治」的這位老宰相，所以斷然奮戰，即出於「不可以窮達變節」的心情。鈴木首相的「奉公十則」，可說是沒有標語的鈴木決戰內閣的標語。</p>
<p>精神健旺日理萬機</p>
<p>鈴木首相的春秋，爲人所知，已有七十九歲，但因保持身體的健全亦信爲奉公之途，所以總是很健旺的。其私人醫師最近也保證鈴木首相身體的健康說：</p>
<p>「眞和年齡不相當，血壓也大體是一百四十左右，與壯年相彷呢。」</p>
<p>每天早晨，總是五時起床，披覽各報，在淸晨的徴風中臨窗讀書。最近讀的一册新書，是酒井鍋次中將譯的「戰時克萊梭內閣」。</p>
<p>現在每晨的日課中，最要緊的是起床後整衣參拜神龕。在這神龕中，供奉着組閣時全國無各人物寄贈的近千的信札。組閣以前，每益常短裝散步，從私邸到小石川植物園。遷入官邸後，是不能散步了。這怕是老宰相唯一的悲哀吧。不過，在這凉爽的五月，首相夜裏也出來走走。上午七時與夫人同進早餐，以後就處理要公，完全是一個繁忙的戰時宰相。</p>
<p>這位戰時宰相，却使側近者感到可敬可愛。鈴木首相是家裏的「老爺子」，無論對誰都很和藹。官邸的衛兵也說：</p>
<p>「眞是人德呀，無論誰都感到慈祥和藹。碰到每個人都會脫帽招呼，質使人有點兒惶恐哪，歷代的首相再沒有更親切的。」</p>
<p>除出謹直的誠意外，再加上和藹可親，這樣的人格日能輻射溫情味。任何閣僚都能體恤這位老宰相，以他爲中心，處理萬機。常首相命閣僚「聽取國民呼聲」時，因爲知道閣議時如果不能反映國民的呼聲，會叫老宰相心碎，所以閣僚們都奉命唯謹。仔細聽，聽而行，而行則以斷然的方式實踐之，這就是鈴木首相爲政的方針。大空襲　後，希特勒元首戰死後舉行的廣播，也不是有人勸告首相的，而是「爲了想和國民諸君盡可能的坦白談談」。而且，廣播的原稿也不煩秘書代作，由鈴木首相親自執筆。這也是爲了要眞實訴說自已的心。此事固屬理所當然，但却非常難得。</p>
<p>自昔以來，鈴木首相愛寫的話，便是：「制空興國」一天空閱達」。今後，鈴木首相亦將空嚝如天，「當保靜謐」，以沉着的態度對付危急，悠悠不迫。而日本一億國民，亦將追隨這位老宰相之後。（譯自五月八日每日新聞）</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>日本戰時外交的方向</h3>
<p>現代戰爭的特徴，是一切力量綜合的戰爭，無論軍事，政治，經濟，外交，思想等都是在同一動機之下出發，而向同一目標前進的。大東亞戰爭的目的，不用說．是在求東亞諸民族的解於，所以盟邦日本旣用軍事的力量，驅逐敵英美的舊勢力，又以外交的方式，對內使東亞諸民族結合起來，對外排除國際間的所有障礙。軍事與外交雖然表現的方式不同，然而外交的方針與舉事的方針是完全一致的。現在戰爭的形勢團然很緊迫，可是日木外交的方針仍和戰意一般的堅定。</p>
<p>日本自鈴木首相組閣起，到現在才一個多月，在國際的關係上，却遇到了二次重大的變化：第一次是蘇聯通知日本廢止中立條約，第二次就是　　的對英美降伏。　兩次雖然都是很重要的變化，可是都能在事前預料到的。前者因爲日蘇中立條約簽訂於一九四一年四月，至明年四月滿五年之期，而於今年四月必須通知廢止與否；徴諸去年十一月蘇聯革命紀念日史太林的演說，就可以推測得到。後者因爲德國戰爭形勢之壞，已非一日，崩潰降伏的事也早已在意想之中。而日本的戰時外交，更因爲新任外相東鄕氏的穩健持軍，絲毫沒有感到動搖與不安。</p>
<p>第一，因爲東鄉外相於昭和十二年（民二十六）至十四年（民二十八）擔任過日本駐德大使，於十四年至十六年（民二十八至民三十）擔任過駐蘇大使，對於德國和蘇聯的情形都非常熟悉，所以能「知彼知己」，以不變的方針應急變的時局。</p>
<p>第二，對蘇外交因爲實際上到中立條約的廢棄還有一年，所以日本在這有效的一年中，一定履行中立條約的規定，同時蘇聯也不致於通知廢止中立條約之後，在最後有效的一年中，發生有關國際信義的行動。</p>
<p>第三，過去因爲日本與蘇聯旣有中立條約的關係，而與德意兩國又有三國協定的關係，所以立塲相當困難，現在德國已向日本的敵國英美降伏，而與蘇聯採取最後對立的態度，則日本常然有自由行動之權，在日木戰時外交的立塲，很是有利。</p>
<p>根據以上的理由，日本的戰時外交，雖然表面上在內閣改組不久遇到這二次重大的變化，可是在實際上部使日本戰時外交前途上晦暗的地方明顯了起來，並且日本的外交方針更可以澈底起來。</p>
<p>其次，在道兩次變化之間，又在舊金山會議開會之前，敵美連選四次的大德統羅斯福突然逝世，這次的變化一定給與日本外交界相當的衝動與興奮，然而日本的外交界也與前綫的將士一般並不因爲戰爭禍首的死亡而減少了敵愾之心，復在舊金山會議之前，於東京舉行大東亞大使會議，發表了大東亞共同聲明，使東亞協同的信念更其堅定。</p>
<p>最近東鄉外相更召集駐華各使節，洽高對華政策之運營問題，在訓詞中鄭重提出「隨着時局的進展，日本對華問題之重要性益形擴大，日本除援助中國之統一及完成其自主獨立外，並於政治方面求平等，經濟方面求互惠，確立中日間之親善關係，日本必須克服一切障礙，藉　實現其根本方針，蓋此與日本克服當前難關具有密切關係。」中日的關係當因此更密切起來，日本的外交政策當更發揮其實踐的力量。</p>
<p>總之，日本的戰時外交是有一定的方針的，無論對華，對蘇，對德，對美，都是在最高的國策之下，與軍事的方針完全一致。在國際政局的變幻中，保持一定的政策。歸納到一個結論：日本外交的勝利，是日本總力戰獲得勝利的一種力量，同時日本總力戰的勝利就是戰時外交的勝利。換句話說：日本戰時外交的方向是和日本總力戰的目標一致的。</p>
<h3>省府組織法修正　昨國防會議通過　今後行政策推進深堪期待</h3>
<p>南京三十日中央社電　最高國防會議於三十日上午舉行第七一次會議，通過要案多件，（另見會議錄全文）其中重要者有行政院二五三次會議通過內政部擬具修正省政府組織法本案一案，原則通過，准先行照辦，仍交立法院審議。按自省行政機構改革方案實施後，省長權力集中，　處分別裁併，職掌分配政務處理，與現行省政府組織法不盡適合，內政部有　於此，爰經考　各省行政實在情形，依據改革方案精神，特擬具修正省政府組織法草案，藉期健全機構，確立體制。查現在省政府下機構，計分政務·財政·敎育·建設四廳及警務處，處，所有撰擬審核保存及收發文件曁各廳處問之一切連絡工作，均集中於政務廳，以致政務廳職掌在無形中較其他各應處爲繁重，因隱與處並行關係，最易惹起與各廳處間之磨擦，今增設秘書處，以綜理不屬於各廳之一般事務，此不論在强化集中省長事權，及祛除過去各廳處間之融洽上，均具有其深長意義。又規定於必要時經中央核准時，得設警務處及其他機關，而將警務事項歸併民政廳辦理，此在行政效率上，當可更趨圓滑一致。故經此次修正後，省行政之推進深堪期待。又昨日會議中，對決戰時期行政院及所屬各部會署附屬機構改革方案，亦予追　，按經此次裁併之各附屬機關，在事實上確無獨立存在之必要，不但將人力資力分散，且在行政效率上亦不如歸倂於性質相同之機關，較爲事權集中。故如行政院合作事業會及農業增產策進會之改隸歸倂於實業部普通行政人員訓練所，文物保管會之改隸內政部，治理運河工程局之歸倂於建設部，以及行政效率促進會及內政部保甲委員會外交部僑務局等之裁撤，均爲賢明之措置。</p>

<h3>實業部訂定　特別配電辦法　軍需民需一律公平處理</h3>
<p>實部爲體恤上海地區一般廠家需用電力增强生產起見，曾由華中水電公司訂定繳交煤斤換收電力辦法實施在案，自施行以來，利用廠家極爲踴躍，惟處理煤斤及計算電力等事宜，尚未盡善，理應加以修正，以期促進工業生產，今特決定根據下列三項原則，重新擬訂辦法，自六月一日起付請實施：</p>
<p>繳交煤斤方法及事務上之處理，儘量予廠家便利。　配給軍刀不論軍需民需，一律公平處理。　計算電力力式改爲繳交標準煤斤一公噸，換取電力四三〇度。其詳細條件，殊爲工業界所重視而關切，茲特　錄如後：</p>
<p>上海地區煤斤調換電力之特別配電辦法用戶提交發電用煤斤（包括補助燃料在內）申請特別配電者，依照左列辦法處理之：</p>

<p>短評</p>
<h3>嚴格執行孩子空法令</h3>
<p>本市市民防空本部，爲喚起市民强化家庭防空設備，自六月一日至九日問，實施「强化防空設施週」，規定每一家庭應注意準備防火防災救急等資材，凡我市民目當盡量遵照準備。</p>
<p>不過，我們必須指出，未來的防空設施，固然需要遵照準備，而過去的防空法令，更應嚴格遵守，如果過去的法令，人民未能切實奉行，當局又未能嚴格執行，則很足以影響未來法令的成信。</p>
<p>譬如燈火管制，已經三令五申，復自五月十五日起，晚間十時以後，經常實施燈火警戒管制，絕對不許燈光外洩，可是，半月以來，在管制時間以內，仍到處發現高樓大厦有燈光外洩者。這種忽視法令的居民，我們認爲當局無可原諒，應嚴格執行注令，予以想當懲對。在開始期間，即不重視法令尊嚴，則轉瞬變成具文，那末，對於張化防空設施週的效力，更將發生懷疑了。</p>

<h3>General Air Attack Continues; Japanese Forces Achieve Great Victory; No Change in Southern Okinawa Island Front Line</h3>
<p>Front Line Base, 30th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The general air attack, which began on the night of the 27th, continued on the 28th, targeting enemy ships in Nakagusuku Bay. From 1:00 AM to approximately 9:00 AM, the entire *Shinbu* Special Attack Force, with direct escort aircraft, penetrated the enemy fleet concentrated in the bay, confirming the sinking or damaging of more than four ships. Furthermore, at dusk on the 28th, a special attack force departing from the base also bravely penetrated one aircraft carrier or large cruiser, one destroyer, and four other ships of unidentified types, achieving great results.</p>
<p>Nansei Islands Base, 30th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – There have been no major changes in the front lines of Shuri and Naha in the southern Okinawa Island area. Japanese air units have continuously attacked enemy ships near Okinawa. From the night of the 29th to the morning of the 30th, continuous attacks have been launched, with successive reports of "penetrating enemy ships" and "all aircraft penetrating." Enemy air raids on the Nansei Islands were limited to only 30 aircraft over Okinawa Island on the 29th, and 60 over Ishigaki Island.</p>
<p>Twenty-One Ships Sunk in Nakagusuku Bay</p>
<p>Front Line Base, 30th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Japanese *Shinbu* Special Attack Force and naval torpedo squadrons fiercely attacked enemy ships concentrated in Nakagusuku Bay, which were urgently resupplying, on the 27th and 28th. According to confirmations from local forces and direct combat aircraft, six ships of unidentified type, thirteen large gunboats, and two medium-sized gunboats were sunk, in addition to numerous columns of fire.</p>
<p>Front Line Base, 30th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Ie Island Airfield, which in the past was mainly used by B-29 type aircraft, has recently seen a small number of medium-sized aircraft. Due to the surprise attack by the Japanese *Giretsu* Airborne Unit on the night of the 24th, F4F "Giant" type aircraft, which lost their bases at the northern and central airfields, appear to be relocating. Only 150 enemy aircraft remain at Ie Island Airfield, half of which are F4F type, and the rest are P-51 type.</p>
<h3>Japanese Garrison Forces Launch Pre-emptive Counterattack; Special Attack Airborne Unit Responds with Fierce Fighting</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Eight days have passed since the several divisions of the Japanese army on Okinawa Island began fighting on the 21st. Under cover of intense artillery fire, a large force of seven divisions (four army divisions and three marine divisions) was concentrated on the front line to launch a persistent attack. The Japanese garrison forces in the area have repeatedly frustrated enemy attempts with skillful pre-emptive counterattacks. Currently, the two armies are locked in a stalemate along the opposing lines, with no major changes. The Japanese garrison forces are tenaciously defending the lines extending from Yonabaru in the east to the south, north of Shuri, and to Naha, continuing their fierce fighting. Furthermore, the *Giretsu* Airborne Unit, which landed at the northern and central airfields on the night of the 24th, has continued its brave and bloody battle while surrounded by the enemy for the past four nights and days, hindering the activities of the enemy base air force. The Japanese garrison forces are also firmly defending their original positions. At the same time, the special attack air squadron, in response to the fierce fighting of the *Giretsu* Airborne Unit, took advantage of favorable weather conditions and launched a heroic and intense attack operation on enemy ships surrounding the island from the morning of the 28th. Due to the fierce fighting of the *Giretsu* Airborne Unit, the enemy has suffered severe damage, resulting in a significant decrease in the number of enemy aircraft intercepted. At the same time, the operational efficiency of the special attack squadron has been extremely good, gradually achieving great results. Due to the skillful and brave fighting of the integrated Japanese air and land forces, the enemy's attempt to control Okinawa Island has been stalled, at least for the past week. The heavy damage suffered on land and at sea is endless, and the anxiety of the enemy's operational command is gradually intensifying. The status of Japanese special attack squadron attacks on enemy ships on the 28th is as follows: Between 7:10 AM and 8:00 AM, a large formation of Japanese special attack aircraft, largely unhindered by enemy fighters, launched a surprise attack on enemy ships at sea around the island, achieving great results. Subsequently, between 7:10 PM and 7:12 PM, a special attack squadron swiftly attacked enemy ships in the eastern sea area. According to reports, one aircraft crashed into an aircraft carrier or cruiser, one crashed into a destroyer, and four crashed into unidentified vessels. Other aircraft also sought out targets and carried out crash attacks.</p>
<p>British Navy Participates in Operations</p>
<p>Nansei Islands Base, 30th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Due to the intense attacks by the Japanese special attack squadrons, the enemy U.S. mobile force in the Okinawa area, facing insufficient reinforcements, has mobilized the British fleet to be responsible for resupply and escort duties around the islands. The British fleet, extremely fearful of the intense attacks by the Japanese special attack squadrons, has fled the area. Currently, a U.S. fleet with a large number of transport ships has appeared in the area, actively supplementing troops, but due to the inability to land, they are drifting back and forth at sea.</p>
<p>Stockholm (Kyongsong), 30th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – A dispatch from London states that the Polish government-in-exile in London announced on the 28th that the Polish naval forces, under the operational direction of the British Admiralty, have begun operations against Japan.</p>
<p>Ninety Enemy Aircraft Shot Down in Raid on Keihin Area</p>
<p>Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – According to an investigation of the results of the Japanese interception of approximately 500 enemy B-29 type aircraft and approximately 100 P-51 type aircraft that attacked the Keihin area on the morning of the 29th, the results are as follows: 20 B-29 type aircraft shot down, 49 damaged; 12 P-51 type aircraft shot down, 9 damaged.</p>
<h3>Japanese Navy Ministry Announces Achievements of *Kamikaze* Squadrons; Former Commander-in-Chief Toyoda Issues Proclamation to All Forces</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Japanese Navy Ministry recently announced the former Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, Toyoda's, proclamation to all forces, stating: "From the start of operations on Leyte Island in late October of last year to the current operations around Okinawa, a total of 453 members of the Navy *Kamikaze* Special Attack Squadrons have sortied.

The First *Tsukuba*, First and Second *Nanasho*, and First *Kamitsurugi* Squadrons fought on the eastern sea of the Ryukyu Islands in early April of the 20th year of Showa (1945). The First *Showa*, Second *Tsukuba*, and Second *Kamitsurugi* Squadrons fought on the eastern sea of Okinawa Island in mid-April of the 20th year of Showa (1945), carrying out certain-death, certain-hit suicide attacks against the enemy mobile force, establishing brilliant achievements, and are particularly worthy of commendation. Their outstanding achievements are hereby proclaimed to all forces."</p>

<h3>Ten Maxims for Public Service: Prime Minister Suzuki's Motto</h3>
<p>"Bury my old body at the forefront of the nation!" General Kantaro Suzuki, who gave this generous cry, has been Prime Minister for one month, from his appointment to May 7th. During this time, on the front lines in Okinawa and elsewhere, loyal Japanese youth have been building a Great Wall of national defense with their flesh and blood, but the situation in Europe has completely changed dramatically. The world is dancing wildly in this vortex, and Prime Minister Suzuki, stepping on this wave, how has he struggled in this month? In a word, Prime Minister Suzuki is practicing one of his own "Ten Maxims for Public Service," namely: "Let others have the easy things, take the difficult things upon oneself." He must have already been practicing this, but from the moment he vowed to fight alongside 100 million citizens, Prime Minister Suzuki has followed this rule every day for the past month.</p>
<p>On the morning of May 2nd, when he received the information that Hitler had died in battle, Prime Minister Suzuki did not even raise an eyebrow.</p>
<p>"Due to the changes in Europe, the beliefs of the general public must not be shaken. We must advance over the corpses of our comrades!" He used "advance over the corpses of our comrades" to express Japan's attitude toward the death of the head of its allied nation. This is in common with the determination to "bury my old body at the forefront of the nation." The soul of Fuehrer Hitler can be said to have found a confidant in Prime Minister Suzuki.</p>
<p>On the evening of the 2nd, Prime Minister Suzuki seemed to think of something and called his nephew, Secretary Takeshi Suzuki, to open the book "Battleship *Soya*", pointing to a certain page and saying:</p>
<p>"My life of over seventy years has been spent striving for this, and I intend to continue to serve the public in this way."</p>
<p>Self-Authored and Self-Written Ten Maxims for Public Service</p>
<p>That page contained the "Ten Precepts for Public Service" that Prime Minister Suzuki, as commander of the training fleet, had given to young ensign candidates on the "Soya" in the 43rd year of Meiji (1910). They were self-authored and self-written by Prime Minister Suzuki, and the contents are as follows:</p>
<p>One must not change their principles due to success or failure.</p>
<p>Constantly cultivate virtue and refine wisdom, seeking knowledge and insight in everyday matters.</p>
<p>One should be guided by fairness and impartiality, shedding all desire for fame and gain.</p>
<p>One should be guided by harmony and cooperation, always harboring thoughts of love and respect.</p>
<p>One should be consistent in word and deed, practicing before discussing.</p>
<p>One should pay attention to maintaining a healthy body.</p>
<p>One should clearly understand the law and honestly abide by it.</p>
<p>Strictly adhere to one's duties and respect the duties of others.</p>
<p>One should be aware of one's abilities and not be arrogant.</p>
<p>Let others have the easy things, take the difficult things upon oneself.</p>
<p>One should always keep one's heart serene and maintain a calm attitude even in the face of emergencies.</p>
<p>Secretary Takeshi Suzuki respectfully read the ten precepts, and when he reached the ninth precept, "Let others have the easy things, take the difficult things upon oneself," he suddenly understood. This is the belief in public service of the 79-year-old Prime Minister.</p>
<p>"The heart to accept the great command must be here!" Only then did Takeshi Suzuki realize the inner secret of his uncle, General Kantaro. And in order to persist in this war, this old Prime Minister, who claimed to "not understand politics," resolutely fights, which comes from the feeling of "one must not change their principles due to success or failure." Prime Minister Suzuki's "Ten Maxims for Public Service" can be said to be the slogan of the Suzuki decisive battle cabinet without a slogan.</p>
<p>Mentally Strong and Managing Thousands of Affairs</p>
<p>It is well known that Prime Minister Suzuki is 79 years old, but because maintaining a healthy body is also believed to be a path to public service, he is always very energetic. His personal physician recently guaranteed Prime Minister Suzuki's health, saying:</p>
<p>"It is truly inconsistent with his age. His blood pressure is generally around 140, which is similar to that of a young man."</p>
<p>Every morning, he always gets up at 5:00 AM, peruses the newspapers, and reads by the window in the morning breeze. The most recent new book he read was a translation by Lieutenant General Nabetsugu Sakai of "The War Cabinet of Clemenso."</p>
<p>Now, the most important thing in his daily routine every morning is to get dressed and worship the altar. In this altar, nearly a thousand letters donated by various people across the country at the time of the cabinet formation are enshrined. Before the cabinet formation, he used to take walks in short clothes, from his private residence to the Koishikawa Botanical Garden. After moving into the official residence, he can't take walks anymore. This is probably the only sorrow of the old Prime Minister. However, in this cool May, the Prime Minister also comes out for a walk at night. At 7:00 AM, he has breakfast with his wife, and then he deals with important official matters, completely like a busy wartime Prime Minister.</p>
<p>This wartime Prime Minister is respected and loved by those close to him. Prime Minister Suzuki is the "old man" of the family, and is very kind to everyone. The guards at the official residence also say:</p>
<p>"It is truly virtuous. Everyone feels kind and amiable. He takes off his hat to greet everyone he meets, which makes people a little apprehensive. No prime minister in the past has been more amiable."</p>
<p>In addition to sincere integrity, there is also amiability, so this personality radiates warmth. Any cabinet member can empathize with this old Prime Minister and, with him as the center, handle thousands of affairs. When the Prime Minister often orders cabinet members to "listen to the voices of the people," they know that if the voices of the people cannot be reflected in the cabinet meetings, it will break the old Prime Minister's heart, so the cabinet members obey with caution. Listen carefully, listen and act, and act with resolute action. This is Prime Minister Suzuki's policy. The broadcast after the great air raid and after the death of Fuehrer Hitler was not someone advising the Prime Minister to do so, but "to talk as frankly as possible with the people." Moreover, the manuscript of the broadcast was not bothered by the secretary to do it for him, but was written by Prime Minister Suzuki himself. This is also to truly tell his own heart. This matter is certainly taken for granted, but it is very rare.</p>
<p>Since ancient times, the words that Prime Minister Suzuki loved to write were: "Control the air and revitalize the country" and "the sky is wide open." In the future, Prime Minister Suzuki will also be as vast as the sky, "keeping his heart serene," and dealing with emergencies with a calm attitude, without rushing. And Japan's 100 million citizens will also follow this old Prime Minister. (Translated from the May 8th *Mainichi Shimbun*)</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Direction of Japan's Wartime Diplomacy</h3>
<p>The characteristic of modern warfare is the comprehensive warfare of all forces. Military, political, economic, diplomatic, and ideological aspects all start from the same motive and move towards the same goal. The purpose of the Greater East Asia War, needless to say, is to seek the liberation of the peoples of East Asia. Therefore, the allied nation Japan not only used military force to drive out the old forces of the enemy Britain and the United States, but also used diplomatic means to unite the peoples of East Asia internally and eliminate all international obstacles externally. Although military and diplomacy are expressed in different ways, the diplomatic policy and the military policy are completely consistent. Now the war situation is very urgent, but the direction of Japanese diplomacy is as firm as the will to fight.</p>
<p>It has only been a little over a month since Prime Minister Suzuki formed his cabinet, but in international relations, it has encountered two major changes: The first was the Soviet Union's notification to Japan to abolish the neutrality treaty, and the second was Germany's surrender to Britain and the United States. Although both changes were very important, they could both be foreseen in advance. The former was because the Japan-Soviet Neutrality Treaty was signed in April 1941, and the five-year term would expire in April of next year, and it was necessary to notify whether to abolish it this April. Judging from Stalin's speech on the anniversary of the Soviet revolution last November, it can be predicted. The latter was because the German war situation had been bad for more than a day, and the collapse and surrender had long been expected. And Japan's wartime diplomacy, because of the steady and disciplined nature of the new Foreign Minister Togo, has not felt any wavering or anxiety.</p>
<p>First, because Foreign Minister Togo served as the Japanese Ambassador to Germany from Showa 12 (1937) to 14 (1939), and as the Ambassador to the Soviet Union from 14 to 16 (1939-1941), he is very familiar with the situation in Germany and the Soviet Union, so he can "know the enemy and know himself" and respond to the changing situation with an unchanging policy.</p>
<p>Second, because there is still one year left before the actual abolition of the neutrality treaty with the Soviet Union, Japan will definitely fulfill the provisions of the neutrality treaty during this effective year. At the same time, the Soviet Union will not take actions related to international credibility in the last effective year after notifying the abolition of the neutrality treaty.</p>
<p>Third, in the past, because Japan had a neutrality treaty with the Soviet Union and a Tripartite Pact with Germany and Italy, its position was quite difficult. Now that Germany has surrendered to Japan's enemies Britain and the United States and has adopted a final confrontational attitude with the Soviet Union, Japan naturally has the right to act freely, which is very beneficial to Japan's wartime diplomatic position.</p>
<p>Based on the above reasons, Japan's wartime diplomacy, although it encountered these two major changes shortly after the cabinet reshuffle on the surface, actually made the obscure places on Japan's wartime diplomatic future clearer, and Japan's diplomatic policy could be more thorough.</p>
<p>Secondly, between the two changes, and before the opening of the San Francisco Conference, the enemy American President Roosevelt, who had been elected four times, suddenly passed away. This change must have given the Japanese diplomatic community considerable shock and excitement. However, the Japanese diplomatic community, like the soldiers on the front lines, did not reduce their hostility because of the death of the war culprit. Before the San Francisco Conference, the Greater East Asia Ambassador Conference was held in Tokyo, and the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration was issued, making the belief in East Asian cooperation even firmer.</p>
<p>Recently, Foreign Minister Togo convened the ambassadors to China to discuss the operation of the policy towards China. In his instructions, he solemnly stated that "with the progress of the situation, the importance of the issue of Japan's relation with China has been increased. In addition to helping China's unification and completion of its independent, not only seek equality on political aspects, but also seek mutual assistance with economy. To establish a Sino-Japanese intimate relation, Japan must conquer all the obstacle and make it happen because this is related to Japan's ability to overcome the current difficulties." The relationship between China and Japan will therefore become closer, and Japan's diplomatic policy will exert its practical power.</p>
<p>In short, Japan's wartime diplomacy has a definite direction. Whether it is towards China, the Soviet Union, Germany, or the United States, it is completely consistent with the military policy under the highest national policy. It maintains a certain policy in the changes of international politics. To summarize, the victory of Japanese diplomacy is a kind of power to win the total war of Japan, and at the same time, the victory of the total war of Japan is the victory of wartime diplomacy. In other words, the direction of Japan's wartime diplomacy is consistent with the goal of Japan's total war.</p>
<h3>Revision of Provincial Government Organization Law Approved by National Defense Council Yesterday; Profound Expectations for Future Policy Promotion</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Supreme National Defense Council held its 71st meeting on the morning of the 30th and approved many important cases (see the full meeting minutes separately). Among the important ones was the case of the draft revision of the Provincial Government Organization Law prepared by the Ministry of Interior and approved by the 253rd meeting of the Executive Yuan, which was approved in principle and allowed to be implemented first, and then submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review. Since the implementation of the provincial administrative organization reform plan, the power of the provincial governor has been concentrated, and departments have been abolished or merged. The distribution of responsibilities and the handling of administrative affairs are not entirely suitable for the current Provincial Government Organization Law. The Ministry of Interior is aware of this and has studied the actual situation of the administration in various provinces, and based on the spirit of the reform plan, has prepared a draft revision of the Provincial Government Organization Law in order to improve the organization and establish a system. The current organizations under the Provincial Government include the Political Affairs, Finance, Education, and Construction Departments, as well as the Police Affairs Office. All the work of drafting, reviewing, saving, and dispatching documents and all the contacts between the departments is concentrated in the Political Affairs Department, which causes the responsibilities of the Political Affairs Department to be more burdensome than other departments. Because of the parallel relationship between the department and the office, it is most likely to cause friction between the departments and the office. Now, a Secretariat is established to manage general affairs that do not belong to the various departments, which has profound significance for strengthening the concentrated power of the provincial governor and eliminating the harmony between the various departments in the past. It is also stipulated that the Police Affairs Office and other agencies may be established with the approval of the central government when necessary, and that police affairs shall be handled by the Civil Affairs Department, which should make administrative efficiency more smooth and consistent. Therefore, after this revision, the promotion of provincial administration is deeply anticipated. Also, at yesterday's meeting, the Executive Yuan and its subordinate ministries, commissions, and affiliated organizations' reform plan for the decisive battle period was also retrospectively approved. In fact, the various affiliated organizations that have been abolished and merged are not necessary to exist independently. They not only dispersed manpower and resources, but also had lower administrative efficiency than merging into agencies with similar natures, where power is more concentrated. Therefore, the transfer and merger of the Executive Yuan's Cooperative Enterprise Committee and the Agricultural Production Promotion Committee to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the ordinary administrative personnel training institute, and the Cultural Relics Preservation Committee to the Ministry of Interior, the transfer and merger of the Canal Management Engineering Bureau to the Ministry of Construction, and the abolition of the Administrative Efficiency Promotion Committee and the Ministry of Interior's Baojia Committee and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau, are all wise measures.</p>

<h3>Embezzlement Case Occurs in U.S. Gold Supply to Chongqing</h3>
<p>Zurich, 30th (Central News Agency dispatch) According to an Associated Press dispatch from Washington: A scandal has erupted in the United States regarding embezzlement in the supply of gold to Chongqing. It is reported that the decision by Chongqing to raise the official gold price was leaked in advance, allowing Chongqing speculators to reap huge profits in just a few hours. In response to this issue, Chongqing Foreign Minister Song Ziwen stated that those speculators would be severely punished. The official gold price in Chongqing was raised from 20,000 yuan to 35,000 yuan per ounce on March 28th, and the leak of information beforehand led to increased purchases. Part of this speculative buying involved the $500 million in gold previously supplied by the United States. This gold was provided by the United States to stabilize Chongqing's currency. Chiang Kai-shek immediately ordered a thorough investigation of the incident. The first report has already been submitted, and it is said that its contents are embarrassing to him. Although the details of the incident are well known to the Chongqing authorities, the strict investigation has prevented further details from reaching the United States.</p>

<h3>Authorities Actively Working to Increase Rice Supply; Cracking Down on Merchants Inflating Black Market Rice Prices</h3>
<p>Shanghai rice prices have been rising sharply in recent weeks, posing an increasingly serious threat to people's livelihoods. Prices of other essential commodities have also skyrocketed. Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry recently came to Shanghai to consult with various parties and decided to take decisive measures to increase supply and stabilize prices. Progress has been made. According to sources, the authorities are purchasing large quantities of grain from producing areas, which will soon be transported to Shanghai in batches. At the same time, they will take strict measures to crack down on merchants who inflate black market rice prices and thoroughly investigate rice hoarding and speculation. The City Commodity Distribution Office will also resume priority rice rations for civil servants of various agencies, and will make up for previous delayed rations. Plans are being made to continue household grain rations. It is expected that rice prices will soon fall.</p>
<p>Assisting Retail Outlets in Selling Household Rice Reserves</p>
<p>The City Commodity Distribution Office, due to the long suspension of household rice rations, has reportedly formulated measures to alleviate the financial difficulties of rice retailers and submitted them to the City Government for approval. The measures involve selling the household rice reserves of rice retailers at low prices on an average basis to each retail outlet to show compassion. The measures are as follows:</p>
<p>Each registered number will be allocated four shi of rice (320 kilograms).</p>
<p>The price per shi is calculated at 30,000 National Currency, deducting the original price of 6,500 yuan. Each registered number must pay 94,000 yuan to the accounting office of this office (regardless of the amount of rice in reserve).</p>
<p>If the rice stored by each retail outlet exceeds the quantity to be purchased, regardless of the amount, the retail outlet must send it to the public sales office designated by this office for verification. The public sales office will collect it and pay back the price (at the original price of 6,500 yuan per shi) and transportation costs (100 yuan per 10 kilograms) to the accounting office of this office.</p>
<p>When retail outlets deliver stored rice, the hemp bags should be taken back after the rice is delivered, and the public sales office will provide bags for storage.</p>
<p>If the rice stored by retail outlets is less than the quantity to be purchased, they should pay the price (at 6,500 yuan per shi) to the accounting office of this office with the delivery order issued by the Second Section of this office, and then pick up the rice from the designated public sales office.</p>
<p>The public fee office should issue a receipt printed by this office upon receiving the rice from the retail outlet.</p>
<h3>Lao Zha Police Sub-Bureau Breaks Up Another Gambling Den</h3>
<p>The third section of the Lao Zha Police Sub-Bureau recently received a confidential report that Zhang Zonghan, owner of the Lao Zha Grand Theater at 574 Fujian Road within their jurisdiction, in addition to performing plays day and night, was hosting gambling gatherings nightly after 12:00, with Hong Jiji, a copper treasure gambling expert, as the dealer, on a large scale. Section Chief Song Bingzheng immediately dispatched officers to secretly investigate and confirmed the report. On the 29th, at around 12:00 midnight, plainclothes police officer Feng Shoushan led more than ten plainclothes detectives and officers to the aforementioned Lao Zha Grand Theater. They first sent someone to infiltrate as a gambler, and under extremely meticulous internal and external coordination, they successfully broke up the gambling den. They arrested Zhang Zonghan, the owner of the den, Hong Shouquan, the dealer, and 53 gamblers on the spot. They seized copper treasure gambling equipment and over 400,000 yuan in cash, as well as over 5-6 million yuan in payment slips (which had been torn to pieces). They took them back to the bureau for investigation and interrogation, and temporarily sealed the theater and suspended its business operations. They will be transferred to the local prosecutor's office for legal action.</p>
<h3>Hengsha District to Establish Special District Office</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government, in order to strengthen and establish public security in the six islands outside Wusongkou, namely Hengsha, Yawo Sha, Ruifeng Sha, and Da Shitou Sha, which were originally under the jurisdiction of the Pudong North District Office, has specially requested the Executive Yuan to establish the Shanghai Special Municipality Hengsha Special District Office to handle the local public safety affairs in Hengsha. The organizational regulations have been approved by the Executive Yuan. In addition to the City Government issuing a clear announcement, it has also ordered the Public Safety and Police Bureau to send personnel to prepare for everything as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Construction Bureau to Regularly Issue Funds to Various Agencies</h3>
<p>The City Construction Bureau has already distributed this month's salaries to the thousands of workers in the bureau and its directly affiliated factories as the end of the month approaches. It is now learned that the bureau has scheduled the following dates for the continued issuance of funds to affiliated agencies: June 1st for various offices, June 2nd for various vehicle registration offices, June 3rd for various wharf management offices, and June 4th for various parks. It is also learned that the bureau has requested banks to provide cash as much as possible or to directly pay in cash. All of the above agencies should go to the bureau on the designated date to collect their funds.</p>
<h3>All Police Officers Should Strengthen Their Beliefs and Work Hard in Their Positions</h3>
<p>Secretary-General Luo Encourages Police Bureau Cadres</p>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Government Secretary-General Luo, at the invitation of the City Police Bureau, gave a speech at 10:00 AM on the 30th on the 8th floor of the bureau to section chiefs below the deputy director and deputy sub-bureau chiefs and above. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding the provision of free rice to police officers, in addition to the Commodity Distribution Office actively seeking ways, Director Sugihara is temporarily contacting the Allied military to request a batch of rice, flour, and miscellaneous grains, which, together with the rice borrowed from the Police Confiscation Disposal Committee, will be sufficient to provide free rice for one month to all police officers in the bureau and will be distributed within two to three days. The Finance Bureau's tax revenue has increased substantially after diligent organization, but even with the increased revenue, it is still not enough to cover the ever-increasing expenditures. In the future, after the collection of in-kind land tax from various counties, the rice and wheat collected will be distributed to civil servants and military police as a priority. All police officers should strengthen their beliefs and work with peace of mind. All police personnel should unite, regardless of nationality, eliminate factions, unite in spirit, cooperate with each other, and fulfill the highest mission of the police. The City Government's personnel decisions, assessments, rewards, and punishments are based on ability, integrity, and diligence. In the future, it is hoped that all comrades will perform their duties honestly, abide by the law, and work hard in their positions to serve the local community with courage. The speech lasted for two hours, and all the officers and police were inspired.</p>
<p>Free Rice Distribution Starts Today</p>
<p>The City Police Bureau, in order to improve the treatment of police officers, will distribute free rice to Chinese officers every month. The free rice distribution for the second half of April and the first half of May has been prepared by the bureau's welfare society and will be distributed uniformly starting today. All offices, bureaus, teams, and institutions have been notified to collect and distribute it according to the regulations. However, it must be ensured that the distribution is accurate and in full quantity, and there must be no trickery or deduction of weight. Any violations will be investigated.</p>
<p>Summer Uniforms to be Worn Starting Tomorrow</p>
<p>The bureau, in order to unify police uniforms and enhance appearances, has carefully planned and prepared summer uniforms. The uniforms for all police officers in the city, regardless of material or style, will be completely uniform and will be worn in full starting tomorrow (the 1st).</p>
<h3>Guilds Must Conduct Price Investigations Accurately and in Detail</h3>
<p>In order to strengthen the guild system and manage the prices of various industries, the Ministry of Industry has ordered the economic bureaus of various provinces and cities to instruct the guilds of various industries to establish investigation teams within each guild organization to specialize in price investigation and statistics. The Economic Bureau of this city has ordered the guilds of various industries to comply. According to informed sources, the investigation teams of the guilds must be established in fact, and the work of investigating and collecting price statistics must be accurate and detailed. They must also be collected and submitted to the competent authorities within the specified period. If the authorities deem it necessary, they may send personnel to investigate the prices of member businesses, companies, and factories of various industries at any time. If it is found that the prices are inconsistent with the prices investigated, in addition to punishing the business according to law, the chairman of the industry guild will also be held jointly liable according to law. Various guild members have requested the authorities to exempt the chairman from joint liability, but the authorities are unlikely to allow it.</p>
<h3>Theaters and Entertainment Venues Must Still Close at 10:00 PM; Late Business Will Be Punished</h3>
<p>In the past, in order to save electricity and adapt to the wartime system, the municipal authorities restricted the operating hours of entertainment venues, requiring them to close at 10:00 PM every night. Later, in order to adapt to the summer season and in response to the requests of various industries, the City Police Bureau revised the regulations to temporarily allow dance halls, cafes, tea rooms, and restaurants in hotels to extend their operating hours until 11:30 PM, but electricity must still be used until 10:00 PM. This has also been announced and implemented. However, it has been found that other theaters, stages, entertainment venues, and various entertainment places have also extended their operating hours without authorization, which is inappropriate. Therefore, the authorities have ordered various sub-bureaus to instruct various entertainment venues, except for the four designated industries such as dance halls, to close at 10:00 PM according to the previous regulations. Late business will be punished.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Industry Stipulates Special Power Distribution Measures: Fair Treatment for Both Military and Civilian Needs</h3>
<p>In order to show consideration for the general manufacturers in the Shanghai area who need to increase electricity consumption for production, the Ministry of Industry, through the Central China Electric Power Company, previously stipulated and implemented measures for exchanging coal by weight for electricity. Since its implementation, the number of manufacturers utilizing it has been extremely high. However, the handling of coal and the calculation of electricity were not yet perfect and should be revised to promote industrial production. Now, it has been decided to re-draft the measures based on the following three principles, to be implemented starting June 1st:</p>
<p>1.  The methods for submitting coal and the handling of affairs should be made as convenient as possible for manufacturers.</p>
<p>2.  Regardless of military or civilian needs, the distribution of power should be handled fairly.</p>
<p>3.  The method of calculating electricity is changed to exchanging one metric ton of standard coal for 430 kilowatt-hours of electricity.</p>
<p>The detailed conditions are especially valued and of concern to the industrial sector. Here are the details as recorded:</p>
<p>**Special Power Distribution Measures for Coal Exchange for Electricity in the Shanghai Area**</p>
<p>Users who submit coal (including supplementary fuel) for power generation and apply for special power distribution will be handled according to the following measures:</p>
<p>A. Users submitting coal for electricity exchange are temporarily limited to the following industries:</p>
<p>(1) Military Supply Manufacturing Industry:</p>
<p>*   Factories designated by the military.</p>
<p>*   Contracting factories certified by the military.</p>
<p>*   Factories qualified to the above items.</p>
<p>(2) Industries Producing Necessities for Stabilizing People's Livelihood:</p>
<p>*   Major Food Manufacturing Industries: Flour, rice, grains, bread, cooking oil, noodles, tofu, sauce (miso), soy sauce.</p>
<p>*   Major Daily Necessities Manufacturing Industries: Textiles (cotton cloth, silk, woolen goods), soap, candles, matches (including raw materials), grease, paper, etc.</p>
<p>*   Other various manufacturing industries deemed important.</p>
<p>B. Coal Quality:</p>
<p>(1) The standard quality of coal is 7% moisture, 30% ash content, and a calorific value of 5,840 degrees per kilogram.</p>
<p>(2) The quality of the coal will be tested and identified by the power plant.</p>
<p>(3) Coal with an ash content of 50% or more and a calorific value of 4,150 degrees or less will not be accepted.</p>
<p>C. Method for Determining Power Distribution:</p>
<p>(1) The power distribution is temporarily set at 430 "kilowatt-hours" per ton of coal of standard quality.</p>
<p>(2) When the quality of coal is above or below the standard quality, the power distribution will be increased or decreased according to the following:</p>
<p>*   When the calorific value exceeds 5,840 degrees, the power distribution will be increased by 2% for every 150 degrees exceeded.</p>
<p>*   When the calorific value drops below 5,000 degrees, the power distribution will be reduced by 2% for every 50 degrees reduced.</p>
<p>*   Starting from 30% ash content, electricity generation will be reduced for every 1% increase.</p>
<p>D. Coal Acceptance Procedures:</p>
<p>(1) When a user applies for coal exchange for electricity, they should fill out an application form according to the format stipulated by the Central China Electric Power Company and submit it to the business department of the company's main office or the electrical branch to obtain its approval.</p>
<p>(2) After obtaining the above approval, the user should immediately send the coal to the Yangshupu Power Plant of the Central China Electric Power Company.</p>
<p>(3) The Central China Electric Power Company will distribute electricity immediately upon receiving the coal and pay the coal price to the user at the allocated price at the same time.</p>
<p>(4) The electricity rate is the same as for general users.</p>
<p>E. These measures will be implemented from June 1st of this year.</p>

<h3>A Record of the North China Famous Figures Painting and Calligraphy Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Ying Ren</p>
<p>The Xinsheng Hall in Beiping held the "North China Famous Figures Painting and Calligraphy Exhibition" in the Chinese Painting Academy, and has almost exhausted the representative works of famous artists in the north, giving art lovers in the south a rare opportunity to appreciate them.</p>
<p>Qi Baishi, who is well known to southerners, is a master of flowers and insects. The bees, cicadas, shrimps, and crabs he draws are all lifelike. The composition of each object has a shining brilliance, fully expressing the vividness of their posture.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Banding is a student of Wu Changshuo. He is good at landscapes and flowers. The arrangement is lively and energetic, and the magnificence contains beautiful features. His landscape works are very similar to Shi Tao.</p>
<p>Mr. Pu Xin's calligraphy is magnificent, and the cursive script is continuous, with a sweeping momentum. His landscape paintings are purely Song and Yuan styles. The detailed pavilions in the giant fine works are especially exquisite. He is known as the "Northern Pu." Mr. Xuetang Pu Songchuang are both famous at the time. Mr. Dong Lizeng's small regular script is also worthy of appreciation. There are many other works, and those who love art should not miss this rare opportunity.</p>
<p>Brief Comments</p>
<h3>Strictly Enforce Child Evacuation Laws</h3>
<p>The Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters, in order to awaken citizens to strengthen household air defense facilities, implemented "Strengthening Air Defense Facilities Week" from June 1st to 9th, stipulating that every family should pay attention to preparing fire prevention, disaster prevention, and emergency materials. All of our citizens should try their best to comply with the preparations.</p>
<p>However, we must point out that while future air defense facilities need to be prepared in accordance with regulations, past air defense laws should be strictly observed. If people have failed to implement past laws and the authorities have failed to enforce them strictly, it is very likely to affect the credibility of future laws.</p>
<p>For example, there have been repeated orders regarding light control, and since May 15th, light alert control has been frequently implemented after 10:00 p.m., absolutely prohibiting light leakage. However, in the past half month, during the control hours, there have still been cases of light leakage in high-rise buildings everywhere. We believe that the authorities cannot forgive residents who ignore the law and should strictly enforce the regulations and impose appropriate penalties. If the dignity of the law is not valued at the beginning, it will soon become a dead letter, and then the effectiveness of Strengthening Air Defense Facilities Week will be questioned.</p>
<h3>Buddhist Association Cooperates in Building the Yuyao Road Public Village</h3>
<p>Regarding the aftermath of the Yuyao Road fire, the gentry and merchants of this city formed a temporary relief committee, and collectively discussed building a public village to improve the living conditions of slum dwellers and prevent the fundamental solution to future fires. Layman Hu Songnian, a representative of the Buddhist Fellow Association, volunteered to cooperate with the relief committee, each responsible for half of the funds, and build 250 bungalows in the style of the public village built after the Jinjia Lane fire the year before. The construction was entrusted to the original builder. The blueprint was finalized and a contract was signed yesterday at the Fabin Hotel of the Buddhist Fellow Association on Changde Road. Each room costs 500,000 yuan for labor and materials, totaling 125 million yuan. However, the current donations received are still far short, and we still hope that enthusiastic people in society will have compassion for the thousands of disaster victims and generously donate for the sake of benevolence, and quickly provide assistance so that they can observe its completion. All sectors are welcome to donate funds, which can be collected by this office, as well as the Far East Bank on Sanma Road and the Jindebank Bank on Tianjin Road.</p>
<p>The Central Education Morality Association's Relief Work Has Ended</p>
<p>The Charity Committee of the Central Education Morality Association of this city, with the enthusiastic support of major philanthropists, purchased a large amount of cowpeas to provide relief to fire victims in Yuyao Road and Xikang Road, and also held subsidized grain sales for the hidden poor. A total of 3,437 disaster victims on Yuyao Road were given 4 catties of white rice and cowpeas each, totaling 13,748 catties of white rice and cowpeas each. A total of 1,581 disaster victims on Xikang Road were given 4 catties of white rice and cowpeas each, totaling 6,324 catties of white rice and cowpeas each. A total of 4,339 people were approved for registration for the subsidized grain sales for the hidden poor, each receiving 8 catties of grain, with each catty only charged half price at 500 yuan, totaling 35,512 catties of white rice sold. At the moment, all matters have been completed, and the poor people have benefited greatly.</p>
<h3>Benefit the Poor and Sick</h3>
