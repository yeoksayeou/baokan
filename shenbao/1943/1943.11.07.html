<p>星期代論</p>
<h3>關於中日同盟條約有田八郎</h3>
<p>— 有田八郞</p>
<p>此次中日兩國間簽訂的同盟新約，重申亙惠平等，睦鄰友好的大原則，其基礎在於東亞的新秩序及世界的和平。我們在今天見到這中日條約，回憶過去中日間的關係，誠不勝感槪系之。日本曾屢次說過，一個國家，一個民族，如不能各得其所，則不能得到世界的和平，這正和在家庭中個人如不能各得其所，則不能維持家庭的和平；又在國家中全體民衆如不能各得其所，則不能期國家的安泰與繁榮，完全一樣。所以我們不能不說，在世界上，國家。民族，如不能各得其所，當然不能希望有世界的和平。因此使各人·各國各得其所，實爲日本肇國的大精神，也是天下的公理與公道。這在最近的外務大臣演說或談話中也可以聽到。實現這種日本肇國的大精神，基於道義而締結的此次中日同盟條約，不僅在中日之間是劃時期的，即謂世界上前無先例的條約，亦不爲過。</p>
<p>見到這條約後，首先所引起的感想，看因此次締結的新條約而失效的，民國二十九年簽訂的中日基本關係條約，其中雖非常瑣細的事件都加以規定。而新條約一切立在平等互惠的立場上，這是值得重視的一點。不過，失效的中日基本關係條約，也並沒有可以非難的理由。因爲中日基本關係條約。乃是締結當時種種　　觀情勢下的產物。當時日本和中國之間，政府·人民的相互理解或信賴，似尙未充分。在這種狀況下，雙方自然連瑣細之點都須在條約上規定，並有着希望現之於約束的心</p>
<p>因此，中日基本條約，乃是從舊秩序過渡到新秩序的階段，如不經過道階段，無論如何不能到達此次的新條約。那就是說，中日兩國人民，兩國政府的理解和信賴，業已非常深契，因此，新條約中沒有設定瑣細規定的必要，也可以算是以眞正的共存共榮的天下大公爲條件，亙相認爲情勢好轉之後方才締結的。所以先前的中日基本條約所具的歷史意義和價值，在我們也不能不充分認識。總之，新條約經過這階段之後方才順利利利完成的。當汪主席爲中日和平而脫離重慶，樹立國民政府於南京，和日本作中日基本條約交涉時，我正任外務大臣，目者汪主席在建設中日關係上，受世間種種批評，但能克服許多困難，努力於吏立中日關係這種堅忍不拔，不屈不撓的精神，表現爲今日的中日新條約。其次，這新條約也是今春以來日本誠意推進新政策，如治外法權的撤廢，租界的交還等，俾國民政府在行政上能充分運用，現在因新條約而完成了密切中日關係的形式。也可以說中日兩國人民的情緒，在這裹已經融洽了。所以現在最重要的，就是以事實來體現新條約的精神，傾注非常的決心與努力。以謀兩國關係的更進一步親密。</p>
<p>但言之非艱，行之維艱，在過去的中日關係上，不僅因　算央美的勢力滲透於東亞，成爲大障礙，且在另一方面，中日關係的本身，亦極複雜而困難，故今日以前，任何人不能否定，在政策的實行上，不免有多少困難。現在英美的勢力業已一掃而空，且由於中日雙方的信賴和理解，而成立了新條約。然而我們不能不預料到，根據這新條約的精神。處理實際的諸問題，確立兩國的親善關係，共存共榮，向大東亞的吏設邁進時，尙有許多困靴。克服這此　困難之後，新條約的輝煌成果，才會實現。在道裹，我相信必須要有百折不撓的決心和强韌的忍耐。我在祝福，歌頌新條約的意義，決不落在人後。然而說新條約就可以解決一切，我並不道樣樂觀。趁此機會，我鄭重希望中日二國人民的忍耐與努力。</p>
<p>其次，自本年春季以來對華新政策的實施，以及此次劃時期的中日新倏約之締結，即在日本內部，或許也有許多人說日本爲了中日的全面和平而訂新約，又全世界或許也有人作此看法，並作這種宣傳。但新條約決不是這樣渺小的東西。新條約乃是立在極速大的立塲上締結的。那就是說，新條約是使萬邦各得其所，共存共榮，向大東亞建設邁進的日本緊國精神之實現。我一面歡送盡了歷史的使命而廢止的中日基本條約，一面並衷心祝福新締結的中日新條約之前途。同時並想强調上面所述的意見。（翔：譯自十月三十一日西部朝日新聞）</p>
<h3>大東亞會議閉幕　六國發聯合宣言　根據五項原則建設新秩序</h3>

<p>夫世界各國各得其所，相倚相扶，同享萬邦共榮之樂者，為確立世界和平之根本要諦。惟英美兩國唯己國之繁榮是圖，歷迫其他國家其他民族，尤其對於大東亞更橫肆侵略恣意榨取，並肆行奴化大東亞之野心，企圖根本推翻大東亞之安定，大東亞戰爭發生之原因即在於此。茲大東亞各國，爲互相提携完遂大東亞戰爭，解放大東亞在英美桎梏之中完成其自存自　，愛根據左列綱領，以建設大東亞時期，貢獻於世界和平之確立。</p>

<p>東條首相致閉會辭</p>
<p>東京六日中央社電　大東亞會議已於六日國幕，日本代表東條首相於閉慕之際，起立致閉幕詞，指出此次會議已收獲三種成果，並已這到所預期之目的。茲誌其大意如次：大　亞會議於無日開幕以來，各國政府之始終在極眞摯極友好之空氣中，審議各項議題，並坦白闡明各國政府之崇高見解，此在東亞歷史上及人類之歷史上實屬罕見。故全世界之聽視集中此次會議者亦學當然，此爲此次會議所獲成果之一。各國代表坦白交換意見，故關係各國對於貫澈大東亞戰爭，以及確立世界和平之決意及理想，在根本上已完全一致，在此次會護中已亞相獲得確認，故各國自信相和相依相扶共同實鬥，必能完成其共同理想及共同之使命，此爲此次會議所獲成果之二。第三爲最重要成果，即此次各國政府意見完全一致所通過之大東亞共同宣言。此宣言係向全世界宣佈大東亞各國之戰爭，及和平雄設之理念之大意章，而世界之歷史從此新添一頁，大束亞各國及國民，於此已獲得明確之共同目標，必爲歡欣，從此彼此提携，爲達到此日標，相信必更　勉，志同道合之世界諸國家諸民族，對大東亞各國在戰爭及建設中之努力，更將表示敬意與同情，而加深對於大東亞建設理念之了解。此次宣言發表後　敵人必定張失其戰爭之目標，此次大東亞會議於達到預期的目標而閉會，其成功誠堪同慶，此實爲出席本會與關係國家代表各位閣下之努力之所賜，亦餘關係各國民對於本會熱心之結品。本人　諸位推就主席，於此謹致敬謝之意。</p>
<p>我國代表答辭</p>
<p>東京六日中央社電　大東亞會議已於六日下午國幕，日本代表束條首相致閉會詞舉，繼由中國代表汪行政院長致答詞，茲誌其原文如次：連日在大東亞會議中，承蒙大會主席東條閣下之指導，諸代表閣下之協力，得此　滿之結果，極可慶慰。大東亞　旦宣言已公布於世界，此宜言之特色在昭示束方之道義精神，一掃西方功利主義。詳言之，即將英美侵略與榨取之傳統政策根本予以肅淸，而重新開　共存榮之東亞新天地。東亞各國各保其獨立自主，同時互相除重共獨立自主。在文化上各發揮共固有之特實，並且緊密協力，從事於融合與創造。在經濟上以亙惠爲基礎，實行長短相補有無相通。東亞各國精誠團結，使國。利民福日益增進，同時世界和平亦必然由此發端。蓋東方之道義精神一視同仁，絕無人種偏見，世界和平由此始能獲得其基礎與途徑，非挾持人種偏見之英美所能　見也。本人代表中華民國參加此千古之盛大會議，深爲感奮，惟有領　國民，追隨先進　監　日本，並與　相友好之泰國·滿洲國·新興之緬甸國·菲律賓國·及印度臨時政府同心協力，履行大東亞宣告，使大東亞共存榮之建設臻於時現，對中國之統一必當竭其所能促共實現，集合全國心力物力，以分關大東亞之責任。　於此制謝主席東條閣下之指導，與各代表閣下之協力，並祝大東亞戰爭勝利勝，大束亞吏緬代表說明提案理由</p>
<h3>東亞應舉總力　支援印獨立　緬代表說明提案理由</h3>
<p>東京六日中央社電　六日（下午之會議，由緬甸國代表巴莫總理提出，」大東亞舉總力支援印度獨立」之議案，旋由列席之自由印度臨時政府主席扛特拉鮑斯氏發表沈痛演說，披　澈底鬥爭之決意，聲淚俱</p>
<p>東京六日中央社電　大東亞會議於六日下午之議會中，通過大束亞共支援印度獨立」，說明提案理由，其大意所謂，但於此乃實有與本會議目的不可分離之一問題，即印度獨立問題。自由印度臨時政府主席江特拉　證明印度獨立問題與大東亞吏設具有密切之關係。昨日會議席上余曾力言印度如無自由，則亞洲亦無自由，今日余擬重申此言，我緬甸人民對於印度獨對本問題之高見。鮑斯披瀝鬥爭決意</p>
<p>斯披　門爭決意</p>
<p>東京六日中央社電　自由印度臨時政府主席江特拉鮑斯於六日大東亞會議席上，爲答覆緬甸代表巴莫氏所提關於束亞全一力援助印度獨立之提案，特起立發言，表明其悲壯心境，大意謂，諸位代表閣下對於印度獨立與援助印度武力門爭，均深表同一情，實深感激。今日會議一席上一致通過之大東亞共同宣言，更充分表明援助印度獨立之會議，此項消息　至印度時，我四　通胞當不勝其煎激，而至世界各國新的希望。傳至世界各國時，必將引起各國之同情。同時將使世界各民族與各　家深爲　極。爲解放印度，對影決戰將於最近展開，大東亞共同宣言實予吾人極大力量。吾人爲前者爲根據道義精神，促進東亞各民族各國家之互助信賴及互相尊重其獨立。印度獨立問題與大東亞各國家之問題稍有不同，蓋吾人除與英國戰爭謀取最後勝利外，別無他途。吾人應奏之途徑，不占勝英國即不能獲得自由。大東亞會護共同宣言實爲解房東亞之宣言，可謂世界史上之一九四三年之大　章，余對大東亞各國援助將英國驅出印度解放印度</p>

<h3>東亞民族團結　建設共榮圈　滿菲緬代表演辭要旨</h3>
<p>東京六日中央社電　大東亞會議席上滿洲國代表張國務總理發表演說，大意謂大東亞戰爭開戰以來，日軍卽到處驅除多年來來蝕來亞犧牲東亞維持自身繁榮之英美勢力，收獲空前未有之偉大戰果。戰爭勃發後未及二年，緬甸菲律賓已宣告獨立，使東亞民族逐次回復其本然姿態而各得其所，數百年來因英美帝國主義之壓迫而失去之生氣與榮譽，如今已遂次回復東亞民族之解放夙願，已因日本帝國始終一貫之道義政策及旺盛之實行力而告實現。</p>
<p>滿國代表說明十年建設計劃</p>
<p>東亞民族保持東亞民族應有之自覺，乃歷史上必然之事實，任何勢力所不能阻止，唯有滿洲建國，始能使大東亞共榮團建設踏入最强而有力之一步，余於此擬就滿洲國十年問之政策，說明其基本問題中之而三如次：　爲民族協和，滿洲國及爲聯合日滿業及共他多數民族而共亦者，此與英美等帝國主義支配共他民族迥乎不同。　爲北方之鎮　，大東亞共榮圈之建設，不僅在完成我國國防，我國位於東亞之北陲，在完成共防術上不使有絲毫不安，實極重要。我國巳與日本帝國締結共同防衛之盟約，形成强固之態勢，實爲一最重大之使命，　爲安定國民生活與訓　國民，滿洲國政府自建開以來，卽迅速統一，從來極其紊亂之貨幣制度，結果已獲得成功，而物價得以安定而能確保國民生活之安定，同時並謀確立治安，四爲開發產業，滿洲國政府於建國第五年度，卽着手實行產業開發五年計劃，克服一切困難之客觀條件，此項計劃前年度已告完成，於昨年度繼即開始實行第二次五年計劉，時至今日吾人應深切認識爲完成大東亞之共榮，實爲天予吾人之唯一機會，吾等十億東亞民族尤應以共博統之精神，總動員大東亞資源，於戰爭中進行建設，於建設中進行戰爭，則最後勝利必屬於我。</p>
<p>菲願供給物資協力完遂戰爭</p>
<p>東京五日中央社電　大東亞會議席上菲律　國代表洛勒爾發表演說，共大意謂：回顧過去歷史，余最引爲遺　者，即何故大東亞諸民族會議以前不克舉行，茲者大東亞諸民族集會一堂，此誠爲有史以來所創見也。確立共榮團旣非專爲日本本身利益着想，亦非爲其他特定國而確立共榮國，束亞共榮圈之根本理念，在於承認各個團　家之自主獨立，以創建共榮圈。代表共榮國之三要道，即共存協力，共榮共存及謀四海民族共有生存權利。日本此次作戰之原因，即爲擁護東亞諸民族之生存權利，余確借日本雖然蓬勃生存，但東亞民族如瀕於滅亡痛苦，則日本亦感不怏，日本之大東亞共榮國根本理念，即在謀與東洋諸民族共同蓬勃榮長，故我人必須協力建設此共榮團。</p>
<p>余於茲代表菲律資共和國聲明，爲貫　大束亞戰爭，決佻給菲律賓可有之精神及物質的要素。最後余請一言，我大東亞諸國家諸民族物心一體，一致團結，爲完遂大東亞戰爭，克服任何障碍壓迫之決心，不久日本於取得勝利之際，大東亞各國即可共同　手　進。</p>
<p>緬甸大敵當前誓必奮門到底</p>
<p>東京五日中央社電　大東亞會議席上，緬甸國代表巴莫總理發表演說，其要點如次：　力陳大東亞會議之重大意義稱：此次會諸係東亞歷史上劃期的，亦爲世界史上一大轉換之偉舉，象微東亞新和秩序及經濟建設基礎之束亞具體之紿集。　囘顧引起東亞團結之事情。　主張東亞各民族應認識日本所予之深厚恩義。　大東亞圈之建設尚未完成，必須克服之，幷舉出一二缺陷處。繼言及現在印度對於反亞洲份子之抗爭，力稱，如無自由强大之印度，即無强大自由强大之緬甸，如無强大之緬甸，則無自由强大之亞洲。　力陳緬甸對於大東亞戰爭及大東亞新秩序之意見謂，新束亞之建設，必須在此次戰爭之砲火下完成之，亞洲僅有勝利與滅亡二途，十亞洲民族如能團結奮起，任何困雖均可迎刃而解，任何戰爭可獲勝利，任何媾和均可遂意。今緬甸處於大東亞最前綫，大敵當前，正備嘗現代戰之慘禍，但此次戰爭不僅專爲緬甸，且爲全束亞之作戰，故緬甸決努力到底。同時深望東亞各國傾其全力援助緬甸，在緬甸結成共同戰錢，如此則東亞之自强自接始可實現，同時東亞亦可擊破任何敵人及敵軍集團，而創造新東亞秩序及運命。</p>

<h3>渝西南地區　發生煤區</h3>
<p>廣州日日中央社電　據桂林大公報　稱，傳渝方西南地區近發生數年來未曾有之煤荒。粵漢湘桂黔桂三鐵路，已有火車數　停　，衡陽電力工廠曾停電一週之久，各都市之工廠亦殆因電力不足停止工作。其原因　有數端即西南各煤礦因水防設備不完善，以致　內蓄水者甚多，大部皆陷於不能開採。水陸交通機關忙於食　遝輪，積煤皆不能運出，煤礦工人多因不滿待遇，轉就他業，致使各煤礦　感勞力不足，煤商皆認爲奇貨可居，紛紛從事囤積。結果一般民衆皆以　燭代替電　，且因電力不足，致引起物價之狂漲。</p>

<h3>印度肌激化　英當局束手無策</h3>
<p>十一月一日，華維爾負起　大的使命，正式就任印度總督，企　用武斷政治以彈壓反英運動，解決食糧問題，而消除社會的不安，擴充印度的軍需產　，以爲宣反攻　甸的　慶萊的印度軍及蒙特巴頓的東南亞洲反軸心軍之兵器廠及兵站基地，並謀食糧增產，徹底强化印度作為業日反攻擊據。可是自從華維爾就任以來，東部及南部印度的食糧璣　愈趨激化，因　而致的社會妥，反英　怡如　華維爾的就任印度總督，現正違到最高潮。茲分析印度民衆所視爲殘酷的食糧問題，檢討現在印度民衆被逼迫到這種悽慘地步的原因，更展望其將來。</p>
<p>可驚的餓斃人數</p>
<p>先看英方表示　　之深刻的數字，英國議會上會報告孟加拉省一週間餓死老逹一千名之多。據十月十八日加爾各答市政府發表，從八月十六日至十月十二日）八星期餘）僅加爾各答一市，餓死者二千四百九十二名，因肌　及其他原因而倒斃路徬者四千七百九十二名。姑以此數爲準，估計孟加拉省全體的餓死數，加爾各答的人口約百五十萬人，孟加拉省約五千萬人，則依此例推算，至少約十五萬人。如共每週有十五萬人餓死，那數字似乎　大吧！現在每　受政府的食糧供給者如以加爾各答九萬人，孟加拉州百七十萬人計，這估計不能算過大。又如其冉回　到本年二月，食糧問題還沒有到今日這樣困答地步的孟買，瑪德拉斯等地，餓死者已超過一萬以上，則上面所估計的數字，或許還是最低的估計，這種悄形，即食糧困難，其原因究究何在呢？第一，由於　優，自然的災害，輸出激增與輸入杜絕，致物資不數民衆的需要。</p>
<p>災荒與價格的騰貴</p>
<p>因反英述動勞衝力减少，旣不是有組織運動，也不是偶然的勃發·而是自然的災害，即在最近，七月中旬，有使孟加拉州普魯特溫地方七十個利莊成爲廢墟的大洪水。八月上旬，有大風災　擊拉其酉晋逹那地方，死傷五萬人，五年內該地不能耕種。另有奧列薩州帕其滿爾地方的洪水，罹難者數千人，最近在十月十日以來，有洪水爲災，瑪特拉斯全市及該南方五十公里的士地盡被本浸，死者三千，罹難者七萬五千。這些災害，在食糧不安上當然更加上了刺激。</p>
<p>緬甸的失陷，　失二百萬噸的米。更在運輸問題上看，印度不能不採取細胞式的交通鋼，可是印度五十萬的利落大爲是分散的，且缺乏鐵道，近代道路，惟一的交通機關是　重車。但那在雨季常陷於不能運轉的狀態。食糧及其他物資的流通欠圓滑，所以祗要有一點早象，消費地帶立現飢　之色，最後，對印度民衆最致命的是食續價格的暴　。以上諸情勢爲惡性通貨膨　的結果，印度的食糧價格，超過戰前十數倍以上。這在每年所得不過四十五慮比的印度民衆看來，是最大的威脅。因英國毫不容情的榨取，被迫過着最低生活的民衆，在一八八一年的平地年齡是三十歲，最近低至二十三歲。可見其體格的脆弱與不健康。金第糧盡，民衆那有不倒斃的道理。但印度不是沒有米，食糧相當豐寫的，但因運輸的不圓滑致偏於一地，及因軍米的囤積，乃出現了有食糧的食糧飢餓。</p>
<p>英帝國走向自滅</p>
<p>目前的食糧困難，從上述原因產生，又另據報告癮疾及虎疫甚爲　獗，印度的慘狀，眞目不忍覩。當然，這一切使印度民衆的生活陷於極端窮乏，乃是英帝國主義之絕對責任。這都是低工資，戰儣，並銀的减價所造成的，總而言之，這是爲了戰爭而過重榨取的結果。對這情形，毫無對策，英帝國主義現在嘗到自己所種下的惡果了。</p>
<p>對於高據阿拉　山脈，虎國實吉斯三角洲的日軍，英國不能不用重慶，印度，美國，非洲的雜牌軍來對抗。同時，對於持有近代武器與豐寫食織的印度國民軍，英國又不能不抓住因肌餓而大叫反英的印度民衆。英國屢次說食糧問題不是政治問題，但此次的訊餓，從其發生的原因而說，那是最大的政治問題。且是超過華維爾和邱吉爾之政治力量的歷史的問題。</p>
<p>日　惡化的食糧問題，將是歷史的審判者，宣告三百年來英帝國主義統治印度的罪惡及其下台，成立在榨取印度之上的英帝國，因此而迅速地走上自糧滅亡之途。（翔：　白十月二十五日東京誠責報知</p>

<h3>松島艦隊報道部長　暢談海戰意義</h3>
<p>日軍發揮强大戰力</p>
<p>中央社訊　日大本營於五舞宣佈波根維爾島海戰戰果後，復於六日發我波根維爾島海面空戰戰續，此對英美之太平洋反攻作戰、及　囘緬甸作戰，物予以重大影饗，日駐華艦隊報道部長松島大佐，於昨日談此兩役之意義，首稱：英美之作戰重點，在企國攻略所羅門羣島之我方最後據點波根維爾島，同時又進行新幾內亞北岸作戰，如果成功，再奪取拉巴爾，在我方戰略團內佔據地位，此固，想像者。據估計集中該方而之敵航空兵力，約有一千架，至於艦船有以戰艦數嚴擔任旗艦之犬部隊活動，陸續運送陸戰隊，謀利用優越航空兵力，欲獲得制空微，並企國登陸作戰</p>
<p>龐大損失</p>
<p>但敵人過去之犧牲較諸此次作戰行動之緩慢，似乎犧牲之數字過於龐大。據五日大本營發衷敵方損害，擊沉或炸沉大巡洋艦一艘或二艘，獻逐艦三至四艘，登陸用舟饗四十艘以上，大型遝輸船二艘，擊破大巡洋艦三至四艘驅逐艦三艘，大型運輪船二艘，其他小型舟　多艘，此外並擊落敵機十架，我方損失僅驅逐艦一艘，巡洋艦一　　傷飛機十五架，自炸或未飛返。六日大本營發表空戰之戰績，更令人驚異，較過去敵人各次損失更大</p>
<p>出血作戰</p>
<p>松島大佐組稱，所羅門戰綫於我方言，因距離上關係，並非發揮最强大戰力之地點，而於敵人因以新幾內亞或澳洲為根擁地，與所羅門燄綫保持最短距離，故我方不得不作戰略上之轉進，儼此種作戰，是所謂「出血作戰」，故敵方所損失之艦船飛機，其殘骸幾可塡滿所羅門海底，人力資源損失，亦殊堪驚人。此為玻根維爾空戰之偉大戰果，為我海軍航空部隊發揮見敵必殺之戰力，可謂我戰力日益强大之表徵，現敵人巳愈迫近我根據地中心，此為吾人本來之願望，此種大戰果可期待在今後永遠繼續。</p>

<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>公司銀行業務之兼併</h3>
<p>盟邦日本為世界首屬一指之商工業國家，其全國之經濟命脈，無不寄托於斯；日本之戰時生產事業，旣足自豪，其一般經濟陣容，尤足為戰時統制經濟制度之表率，舞以公司銀行樂務之兼併問題而論，在戰時之日本，一切金融事業。信託公司與普通銀行，曁諸需銀行，及銀號·錢莊，凡在同一都市中成可兼併，使企業合理化人員合理化，且店舖亦得出諸整理，但為人民收解支付之便利計，得分段設立辦事處，而為統制金融作一步魏進計·兼營合併之條例，必須厲行，因為在國策上不特資金得以集中，抑且過去之營業競爭，步驟混亂，以及暗中經營投機諸弊，均得淸掃無餘。</p>
<p>我國財政當局為切實執行金融統制政策·整飾經潛機構起見，近曾通飭資金不足規定之銀行，限於一個半月內按照部頒新章，增是資金，如逾今年年底而仍不將資金加足者，當予以相當處分，　節重大者可能勒令停業。如此一個嚴厲整飭金融機構的施策，自極合於戰時經濟制度之要求。可是，依照統計，本市大小銀行共有二百六十六家之多，其中組識不健全者勢所難免，一方面固然可以限令資金不是額的銀行趕辦增資，一方面似亦未嘗不可以刻意模仿日本國內同一都市中公司餵行業務之兼併辦法，好像對於調整金融方面，來得更為集體化。「合併小銀行」問題，在過去一個時期中，亦曾一度高唱人雲，祗是事實的表現，似乎始終不夠鮮明。</p>
<h3>證交明日開拍　買賣方式决定　上午交易下午停市</h3>
<p>華商證券交易所奉令籌備復業後，除於九月二十九日舉行復業典禮外，一切佈習業巳就緒，准八日（星期一）開市，交易時間暫定上午九時三十分至十二時，凡經審查合格核准之華商股票，一律上市，市塲內准各經紀人憑證入塲，並許可各經紀人派代理人一名，顧客等均不准入塲，上市之股票依次在開拍，公佈開盤行市後，即</p>

<p>「有價證券按照價格徵收之，其價格內頁元以下數目應按百元計算，現貨徵收買賣價格萬分之六，期貨　約定價萬分之四。」此次交易均為現貨，所以決依萬分之六徵收之。是項稅率，責成原經紀人向買賣當事人附帶各征半數，付與交易所彙解，如經紀人不為附征交付或交付不足　時，交易所應負責代繳，並聞八日之嬰市不再舉行儀式，唯該所理監事及監督員，均蒞塲監督交易，一切依照營業細則辦理之。</p>

<p>銀行業間業會，前以財部修正銀行資本法令，各銀行尙有未盡明療之處，曾向財部呈　解釋，茲錄財部批文如下：查此次修正各銀行法規，有關資本數額條文，係以再　正銀行註册軍程為主，以修正能當銀行法信在公司暫行條例為從。上項銀行註册章程第三條修正文理由，係因銀行註册章程原規定之資本如限額，以現在物價指點數相衡，尙不止提高至修正文所　之數額，修正文第二項列為資本至少須　六百須萬元，　公司法規定賣受二分之一計三百萬元，即為合格，原所以　免　動過　，又於必要時得由本部令　將未收之三百萬元，續行收足，不必再經增資手續，如此辦理，較富彈性，是普通銀行如兼警儲蓄信托業務，廳於上項認而未　資本以外，至少各增地百萬元，方可兼顧，來呈所列各說，自應以第一說為準。至十項資本各限額原指敢低者而言，如因股票面值畸零，不妨將資本總額或實收數額，酌量增加，以資調整，據陳前情合生令仰知照，並轉行知照，此批。</p>

<h3>洋商企業之華人股權問題</h3>
<p>— 魯非</p>
<p>値此盟邦當局積極進行移管敵產於國府之際，吾人　願以人民立塲，將洋商企業之華人股權問題，提出於盟邦及國府當局之前；甚盼能於　時期之內，予以合理之解決、幸當局加以營意與合理的考慮也。</p>
<p>過去，吾國因產業落後，政局擾攘，故為發展工商振興產業所必需的民族產業資本市塲，未曾確立。是以國人之　餘資金，遂為洋商誘　，集注於外殷市塲。中日事變後，各地游資復不斷鉅銀匯集　　，網一般工商又因受戰事影響，　　　　，無從正當利用此剩餘之鉅　　金。因之，迄大東亞戰發為止之此一時期中，華人資金投資於洋商各　樂者，為數至鉅！大東亞戰發後，英美荷等各洋商企樂，皆受敵產處分，而由盟邦軍當局統制管理。華人投資於此項企業之股票，雖並未同受敝性處分。惟事實上因各敵　企業受軍管理後，股息股利之迄今停發，　轉過戶之停止，公開市塲之鉉閉等種種原舞，以致興遭受敵性，無定期凍結無興！炎買旣不可能，轉讓復多窒礙，本息利潤更無事實上公開之保障。僅此無種已使一般中小投資人感到莫大之一煩惱了。</p>
<p>本市遭受軍管理之敵性企業，除一部分因種種關係迄未復業外，其餘均已恢復經營。年來物價步漲不已，各該企業之生產，經營之義利諒必亦大有可觀。是以吾人顛盼盟邦敵產管理當局，根據平等一互惠文塲，將中國投資人應得之股息殷利迅予嚴付。此舉不　使一般人民在心瑰上發生良好之影響，抑且對於自紗布收買後，一般中小商人黛借不易的目前經濟緊迫狀况，大有實惠。甚且有若干中小投資者，通去因生活安定，蓄積，為企業之投資，今則，物價高漲，生活頗有難以維持之槪，其所期望於股息股利之撥付，或出賣其股票易錢鈔以應付他種需用，其殷切之情，當一更非筆墨所可形容也。</p>
<p>至於，股票過戶手續之繼續辦理，亦為當務之急：大東亞戰發迄今之近二週年中，其問有不少股票已屢屢易主，為確認投資者合汶之殷權計，往盼各企業管理者，能迅予恢復辦理過戶手續，這舉更可使遺失者及他種原因而失去股票者，亦可得合法之保護。</p>
<p>假使因過戶便利後、投機者右以殷票作為　碼之憂，那未，不妨直接將股票參加華商證券交易所關拍，如此，　買旣受公開之監餐與指鄴、投機之危險、當然是可避免了。</p>
<p>最後、對於盟邦之將敵產移管，筆者亦有管見數端，顯附此陳於當局。</p>
<p>將敵逢移吾國國府接　經　、這是基於選義互蔥的立塢的結果：這是値得我們向盟邦致謝的。不過，我們基於增加生產與增加人民福利的立塲，願盟邦與國府二當局，能將若干與人民日常生活有極密切關係的生產性企業，改為官民合辦、或中日官民合辦、或官醫民營：由官方承受敵性國人民之股權·並派監督協助由華人殷東選出之董監，積極活用各痰設備，予以最大最合理之經　。或困於資金　　，不足應付，則可增資或由官方貸予低利資金。務使其能為全民閱利而　極生產。此類生產性企業，大部為輕工紫，如：紡織工業，造紙工業，釀造工業，化學工業等類。其他如公用事業性質之企業，如電爺·電燈·自來一水電車公共汽車五斯等等，或則由中日官方合辦·或則由中國官方獨辦，或日方獨辦，唯視其實際對於人民及兩國之　利為依歸。至於重工業方面之各企業，亦可依上述原則辦理。如果眞的這探實行的話，那末，對於中日兩國正在狹極推動着的增產工作，以及力求復興中的華中經濟，我們相信·一定有很大的貢獻哩！於此，我們不勝拭目以待今後事實的演進！</p>

        <h1>1943.11.07</h1>
<h3>Concerning the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty by Arita Hachiro</h3>
<p>— Arita Hachiro</p>
<p>The new alliance treaty signed between China and Japan this time reiterates the great principles of mutual benefit and equality, and good neighborly friendship. Its foundation lies in the new order of East Asia and world peace. Today, as we witness this Sino-Japanese treaty, recalling the past relationship between China and Japan, I am filled with profound emotions. Japan has repeatedly stated that if a nation, a people, cannot each find their proper place, world peace cannot be achieved. This is just like how in a family, if each individual cannot find their proper place, family peace cannot be maintained; and in a country, if the entire population cannot find their proper place, national stability and prosperity cannot be expected. Therefore, we must say that in the world, if nations and peoples cannot each find their proper place, naturally, we cannot hope for world peace. Thus, enabling each individual, each nation, to find their proper place is truly the great spirit of Japan's founding, and it is also the universal principle and justice of the world. This can also be heard in the recent speeches or talks of the Foreign Minister. The Sino-Japanese alliance treaty this time, which realizes this great spirit of Japan's founding and is concluded based on righteousness, is not only epoch-making between China and Japan, but it is no exaggeration to say that it is an unprecedented treaty in the world.</p>
<p>The first feeling that arises after seeing this treaty is to look at the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty signed in 1940, which is rendered ineffective by the newly concluded treaty. It stipulated even very trivial matters. The fact that the new treaty is entirely based on the position of equality and mutual benefit is a point worth emphasizing. However, there is no reason to criticize the invalidated Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty either, because the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty was a product of the various prevailing circumstances at the time of its conclusion. At that time, mutual understanding or trust between the governments and peoples of Japan and China did not seem to be sufficient. Under such circumstances, both sides naturally had to stipulate even trivial points in the treaty, hoping to realize it through constraints.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty was a stage of transition from the old order to the new order. The new treaty this time could not have been reached without passing through that stage. That is to say, the understanding and trust between the peoples and governments of China and Japan has already deepened significantly. Therefore, there is no need to set trivial regulations in the new treaty. It can also be considered that it was concluded after both sides believed that the situation had improved, with the true coexistence and co-prosperity as the universal principle and condition. Therefore, we cannot but fully recognize the historical significance and value of the previous Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty. In short, the new treaty was smoothly completed after going through this stage. When Chairman Wang Jingwei left Chongqing for Sino-Japanese peace, established the National Government in Nanjing, and negotiated the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty with Japan, I was serving as the Foreign Minister. I witnessed Chairman Wang receiving various criticisms from the world in building Sino-Japanese relations, but he was able to overcome many difficulties and strive to establish Sino-Japanese relations. This indomitable and unyielding spirit is expressed in today's new Sino-Japanese treaty. Secondly, this new treaty also reflects the sincere promotion of new policies by Japan since this spring, such as the abolition of extraterritoriality and the return of concessions, so that the National Government can fully exercise its administration. Now, the form of close Sino-Japanese relations has been completed by the new treaty. It can also be said that the emotions of the peoples of China and Japan have already been harmonized here. Therefore, the most important thing now is to embody the spirit of the new treaty with facts and to pour in extraordinary determination and effort to seek further intimacy in the relations between the two countries.</p>
<p>However, it is easy to say but difficult to do. In the past Sino-Japanese relations, not only did the penetration of Anglo-American forces into East Asia become a major obstacle, but also the Sino-Japanese relationship itself was extremely complex and difficult. Therefore, before today, no one can deny that in the implementation of policies, there were inevitably many difficulties. Now, the forces of Britain and the United States have been swept away, and a new treaty has been established due to the trust and understanding between China and Japan. However, we cannot but foresee that according to the spirit of this new treaty, when dealing with practical problems and establishing friendly relations and co-prosperity between the two countries, and moving towards the establishment of Greater East Asia, there are still many difficulties. After overcoming these difficulties, the brilliant achievements of the new treaty will be realized. In this, I believe that we must have an indomitable determination and strong perseverance. I am blessing and praising the significance of the new treaty, and I will never fall behind. However, I am not so optimistic as to say that the new treaty can solve everything. Taking this opportunity, I solemnly hope for the patience and efforts of the people of China and Japan.</p>
<p>Secondly, the implementation of the new policy towards China since the spring of this year, and the conclusion of this epoch-making new Sino-Japanese treaty, even within Japan, perhaps many people say that Japan concluded the new treaty for the overall peace of China and Japan, and perhaps some people around the world also view it this way, and make such propaganda. But the new treaty is definitely not such a trivial thing. The new treaty was concluded on a very large scale. That is to say, the new treaty is the realization of Japan's founding spirit of enabling all nations to find their proper place, coexist and prosper, and move towards the construction of Greater East Asia. While I bid farewell to the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty, which has fulfilled its historical mission and been abolished, I also sincerely bless the future of the newly concluded Sino-Japanese Treaty. At the same time, I would like to emphasize the above-mentioned opinions. (Xiang: Translated from the Western Asahi Shimbun on October 31)</p>
<h3>Greater East Asia Conference Concludes, Six Countries Issue Joint Declaration, Building a New Order Based on Five Principles</h3>
<p>Tokyo, November 6th, Central News Agency dispatch – On the first day of the Greater East Asia Conference, representatives from the six countries delivered speeches one after another, expressing each country's determination to complete the Greater East Asia War and build Greater East Asia, yielding great results. The second day continued, beginning with Japanese representative Prime Minister Tojo presenting a bill. After each representative expressed their opinions on this, there was a short break, and it reopened in the afternoon. At that time, Japanese representative Prime Minister Tojo read out the draft of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. Each representative applauded to welcome it. Then, Prime Minister Tojo added that if they agreed, please stand up immediately. As soon as he said that, the representatives of the six countries all stood up in unison. Subsequently, the applause shook the room. The whole atmosphere was extremely tense and solemn. This historical Greater East Asia Joint Declaration was then passed unanimously.</p>
<p>Full Text of the Declaration</p>
<p>Tokyo, November 6th, Central News Agency dispatch – The secretariat of the Greater East Asia Conference released the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration as follows:</p>
<p>It is the fundamental essence of establishing world peace that all countries in the world each find their proper place, rely on and support each other, and share the joy of co-prosperity for all nations. However, the United States and Britain only seek their own prosperity and have long oppressed other countries and other nations. In particular, they have wantonly invaded and exploited Greater East Asia, and recklessly pursued the ambition of enslaving Greater East Asia, attempting to fundamentally overthrow the stability of Greater East Asia. This is the cause of the Greater East Asia War. Now, the countries of Greater East Asia, in order to cooperate with each other, complete the Greater East Asia War, liberate Greater East Asia from the shackles of Britain and the United States, and achieve their own survival and self-reliance, based on the following principles, to build the Greater East Asia era, contribute to the establishment of world peace.</p>
<p>The countries of Greater East Asia jointly ensure the stability of East Asia and establish an order of co-existence and co-prosperity based on morality. The countries of Greater East Asia respect each other's autonomy and independence, seek the reality of mutual assistance and harmony, in order to establish the amity of Greater East Asia. The countries of Greater East Asia respect each other's traditions, develop the creativity of each nation, in order to enhance the culture of Greater East Asia. The countries of Greater East Asia closely cooperate with each other under mutual benefit, in order to promote their economic development and increase the prosperity of Greater East Asia. The countries of Greater East Asia promote friendship among all nations, abolish racial discrimination, spread universal culture, and further open up resources, in order to contribute to the development of the world.</p>
<p>Closing Remarks by Prime Minister Tojo</p>
<p>Tokyo, November 6th, Central News Agency dispatch – The Greater East Asia Conference closed on the 6th. Japanese representative Prime Minister Tojo delivered closing remarks when it concluded, pointing out that this conference has yielded three achievements and has achieved the expected goals. The main points are as follows: Since the opening of the Greater East Asia Conference, the governments of all countries have deliberated on various issues in an extremely sincere and friendly atmosphere from beginning to end, and frankly clarified the lofty views of their governments. This is rare in the history of East Asia and in the history of mankind. Therefore, it is also natural that the attention of the whole world is focused on this conference. This is one of the achievements of this conference. Representatives of all countries frankly exchanged views, so the determination and ideal of the countries concerned to carry out the Greater East Asia War and establish world peace have been completely unified in essence. It has been confirmed at this conference that the countries concerned are confident that they can rely on and support each other and fight together to complete their common ideals and common mission. This is the second achievement of this conference. The third and most important achievement is the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration passed by unanimous agreement of the governments of all countries. This declaration is a general outline for announcing to the world the war and peace ideals of the countries of Greater East Asia, and a new page has been added to the history of the world from now on. The countries and peoples of Greater East Asia have obtained a clear common goal, and they must be happy about it. From now on, they will cooperate with each other to achieve this goal, and it is believed that they will work harder. The countries and nations of the world with the same ideals will express respect and sympathy for the efforts of the countries of Greater East Asia in war and construction, and deepen their understanding of the ideals of Greater East Asia. After the publication of this declaration, the enemy must lose sight of their war goals. This Greater East Asia Conference closed after achieving the expected goals, and its success is truly worthy of common celebration. This is due to the efforts of the representatives of the attending and related countries, as well as the enthusiastic support of the related peoples. I, the chairman elected by you, would like to express my sincere gratitude here.</p>
<p>Reply from Our Country's Representative</p>
<p>Tokyo, November 6th, Central News Agency dispatch – The Greater East Asia Conference closed in the afternoon of the 6th. Japanese representative Prime Minister Tojo delivered closing remarks, followed by a reply from Chinese representative Wang Jingwei, President of the Executive Yuan. The original text is as follows: In the Greater East Asia Conference these past few days, thanks to the guidance of Chairman Tojo and the cooperation of the representatives, we have achieved this satisfactory result, which is extremely gratifying. The Greater East Asia Joint Declaration has been announced to the world. The characteristic of this declaration lies in demonstrating the moral spirit of the East and sweeping away the utilitarianism of the West. In detail, it fundamentally eliminates the traditional policy of aggression and exploitation of Britain and the United States, and reopens a new world of coexistence and co-prosperity in East Asia. The countries of East Asia each maintain their independence and autonomy, and at the same time mutually respect each other's independence and autonomy. Culturally, they each develop their inherent characteristics, and closely cooperate to engage in integration and creation. Economically, they implement mutual supplement and communication of resources based on mutual benefit. The countries of East Asia are united in sincerity, so that the national interests and people's well-being will increase day by day, and at the same time, world peace will inevitably originate from this. For the moral spirit of the East treats everyone equally, without any racial prejudice. World peace can only obtain its foundation and path from this, which cannot be seen by Britain and the United States, which harbor racial prejudice. I am deeply inspired to represent the Republic of China in participating in this grand conference of the ages. I can only lead the people to follow the advanced Japan, and cooperate with the friendly Thailand, Manchukuo, the newly emerging Burma, the Philippines, and the Provisional Government of India to fulfill the Greater East Asia Declaration, so that the construction of Greater East Asia's coexistence and co-prosperity will reach realization. We must do our best to promote the realization of China's unification, gather the national spirit and resources, and share the responsibility of Greater East Asia. Here, I thank Chairman Tojo for his guidance and the cooperation of the representatives, and wish the Greater East Asia War victory, and the Greater East Asia liaison representative explained the reasons for the proposal.</p>
<h3>East Asia Should Mobilize All Forces to Support India's Independence, Burmese Representative Explains the Reasons for the Proposal</h3>
<p>Tokyo, November 6th, Central News Agency dispatch – At the meeting on the 6th (afternoon), Burmese representative Prime Minister Ba Maw proposed a resolution to "mobilize all forces in Greater East Asia to support India's independence." Subsequently, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Chairman of the Provisional Government of Free India, delivered a poignant speech, revealing his determination to fight to the end, with tears in his eyes.</p>
<p>Tokyo, November 6th, Central News Agency dispatch – At the parliamentary meeting on the afternoon of the 6th, the Greater East Asia Conference passed "Greater East Asia jointly supports India's independence." Explaining the reasons for the proposal, the main idea is that this is a problem that is inseparable from the purpose of this conference, namely the problem of Indian independence. Chairman Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose of the Provisional Government of Free India proved that the problem of Indian independence has a close relationship with the establishment of Greater East Asia. Yesterday, at the conference, I strongly stated that if India has no freedom, then Asia has no freedom. Today, I intend to reiterate this statement. The Burmese people have high views on this issue regarding Indian independence. Bose revealed his determination to struggle.</p>
<p>Bose Reveals His Determination to Struggle</p>
<p>Tokyo, November 6th, Central News Agency dispatch – Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Chairman of the Provisional Government of Free India, stood up and spoke at the Greater East Asia Conference on the 6th in response to the proposal made by Burmese representative Ba Maw regarding East Asia's united support for India's independence, expressing his tragic mood. The main idea is that all the representatives have expressed the same feeling regarding Indian independence and supporting India's armed struggle, for which I am deeply grateful. The Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, which was unanimously passed at today's meeting, fully demonstrates the support for the meeting on Indian independence. When this news reaches India, my 400 million compatriots will be overwhelmed with excitement, and it will bring new hope to countries all over the world. When it is transmitted to countries all over the world, it will surely arouse the sympathy of all countries. At the same time, it will make all nations and families deeply affected. In order to liberate India, the decisive battle against the United Kingdom will be launched soon. The Greater East Asia Joint Declaration gives us great strength. We are based on the spirit of morality to promote mutual assistance, trust, and mutual respect for the independence of all ethnic groups and countries in East Asia. The issue of Indian independence is slightly different from the issues of other countries in Greater East Asia, because we have no other way but to fight the United Kingdom to seek final victory. The only path we should take is to fail to defeat the United Kingdom cannot gain freedom. The Joint Declaration of the Greater East Asia Conference is a declaration to liberate East Asia, and it can be called a great chapter in the world's history in 1943. I support all the countries of Greater East Asia to help drive the United Kingdom out of India and liberate India.</p>

<h3>Greater East Asia Conference Creates a New Era in the World, Relevant Authorities in Our Country Express Their Thoughts</h3>
<p>Nanjing, November 6th, Central News Agency dispatch – Just one week after China and Japan signed the Alliance Treaty, when our country, both the government and the public, were deeply celebrating the completion of independence and autonomy, the Greater East Asia Conference, which aims to unite one billion people in East Asia and is the focus of the world's attention, was solemnly inaugurated in Tokyo, Japan.

It is also the close unity of all the ethnic groups in East Asia, and a great oath to seek the liberation of East Asia. Its significance is significant, needless to say. Therefore, we not only express our warm congratulations to the conference, but also place great expectations on it. We earnestly hope that the representatives of all countries attending the conference will thoroughly implement the resolutions after the conference closes, jointly seek the close unity of the billion people in Greater East Asia, strive for the establishment of co-existence and co-prosperity, and devote all their strength to learning, the common enemy of East Asia, the British and American imperialism, in order to achieve the great mission of war construction and East Asian co-prosperity, and then to calculate and stabilize the foundation of permanent peace in the world.</p>

<h3>Six Enemy Ships Sunk off Bougainville Island, Japanese Headquarters Announced Air Force Battle Results Yesterday</h3>
<p>Tokyo, November 6th, Central News Agency dispatch – The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 11:00 AM on the 6th: The Imperial Navy Air Force discovered enemy mechanical units in the waters south of Bougainville Island on the evening of November 5th and attacked them, with the following results: One large aircraft carrier, one medium aircraft carrier, two large cruisers, and two cruisers or large destroyers were sunk. Three of our aircraft did not return. (Note) This battle is called the Bougainville Island Sea Air Battle.</p>
<p>Tokyo, November 6th, Central News Agency dispatch – The Japanese naval air squadron participated in the Bougainville Island naval battle on the 1st, and on the 2nd, it launched a battle to annihilate the enemy air force over Rabaul. Then, on the evening of the 5th, the enemy's powerful mobile unit, mainly aircraft carriers, was strongly attacked in the sea south of Bougainville Island. Four Japanese naval search planes discovered two aircraft carriers and four cruisers in the sea south of Bougainville Island on that day. After receiving the report, they set off from Rabaul separately. In addition, there were four patrol planes, a total of eighteen planes. They boldly killed them to the enemy fleet airspace. At that time, it was 5:15 PM, and a brave torpedo attack was launched immediately. About thirty minutes after sunset, the sea surface was black, which was indeed an excellent opportunity to attack. The Japanese aircraft first threw torpedoes with the will to win, hitting the enemy's large aircraft carrier "Ireland type", causing a large explosion. The ship sank in just two minutes. An enemy new-style medium aircraft carrier also caught fire after being hit by a torpedo and sank in an instant. Two enemy large cruisers and two cruisers (or large destroyers) accompanying the ship were also sunk one after another. So far, six of the enemy's eleven mobile units have sunk, and only three Japanese aircraft have not returned to base. The enemy's supply line in the Pacific Ocean was completely destroyed by these two naval and air battles, so the enemy is currently trying to make up for these damages. In addition, the enemy's supply line to eastern New Guinea and the Solomon Islands has also been completely cut off.</p>

<h3>Future Economic Development Direction of Our Country, Developing Resources and Increasing Production</h3>
<p>Nanjing, Today, Central News Agency dispatch – At the Greater East Asia Conference, the representatives of all countries unanimously and enthusiastically passed the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, clarifying the future direction of the efforts of the countries of Greater East Asia. Regarding economic issues, it strongly states that the countries of Greater East Asia will closely cooperate under mutual benefit to promote their economic development and increase the prosperity of Greater East Asia. After the announcement of the above declaration, a Central News Agency reporter immediately visited a certain economic authority to ask about the future direction of our country's economic development. According to him, our country's industry and commerce have always been backward, and even more completely destroyed since the Incident. Since the return of the National Government to the capital, it has actively engaged in rectification. The direction of future efforts should naturally follow the National Government's wartime economic emergency measures and strive to move forward. In addition to focusing on suppressing prices and stabilizing people's livelihoods, we should also engage in increasing production. Regarding increasing production, our country's representative Wang Jingwei, President of the Executive Yuan, has listed it as one of the three major priorities of the National Government's future work in his speech at the Greater East Asia Conference. He also stated that increasing production is the center of gravity for all economic plans and financial plans, and has great benefits for increasing the strength of the total decisive battle. Therefore, the direction of future development in the economic world lies in striving to develop resources, so that production will increase significantly, enhance the strength of the total war, in order to seek the early completion of the Greater East Asia War, and then contribute to the prosperity of the world.</p>
<h3>Xu Liqiu Delivers a Speech</h3>
<p>Nanjing, November 6th, Central News Agency dispatch – The delegation of our country attending the Greater East Asia Journalists Congress, led by Xu Liqiu, is about to depart. The head of the delegation, Xu Liqiu, specifically released a speech before his departure as follows:</p>
<p>The significance of the Allied countries convening the Greater East Asia Press Congress this time is extremely significant. I still remember that in 1935, our government hosted the East Asia Journalists Congress in Guangzhou, discussing concrete plans to unite the East Asian nations and build the East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere. The press circles of China, Japan, and Manchukuo gathered together, and their feelings were extremely harmonious. Last year, Manchukuo convened the East Asia Conference of Writers, and the situation was even more enthusiastic. At this time, the Greater East Asia War has entered a decisive stage. After the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, there is also the holding of the Greater East Asia Conference. And the Greater East Asia Press Congress is held after the Greater East Asia Conference. The great significance is self-evident. In today's affairs, all East Asian nations should regard the completion of the Greater East Asia War as the first priority. Especially the press circle bears the heavy responsibility of public opinion. Cooperating with the Greater East Asia War is what we journalists should strive for, in order to achieve real results. This time, being dispatched to participate in the conference, I am aware that my responsibility is very heavy. However, I should sincerely follow the national policy, abide by the instructions of the leader, and honestly exchange views with the press circles of the Allied countries and other friendly countries in East Asia. I also hope that the people of the country will guide me, so that I will not fail to live up to expectations. This is what I hope for.</p>

<h3>East Asian Nations Unite to Build a Co-prosperity Sphere: Highlights of Speeches by Representatives from Manchukuo, the Philippines, and Burma</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) - During the Greater East Asia Conference, Prime Minister Zhang of Manchukuo delivered a speech, stating that since the start of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese army has been driving out the British and American forces that have been eroding Asia for years, sacrificing East Asia to maintain their own prosperity, and achieving unprecedented great victories. In less than two years since the outbreak of the war, Burma and the Philippines have declared independence, allowing the East Asian nations to gradually return to their original state and each find their place. The vitality and honor lost over the centuries due to the oppression of British and American imperialism are now gradually being restored. The long-cherished desire for the liberation of East Asian nations has been realized due to the consistent righteous policies and vigorous implementation by the Japanese Empire.</p>
<p>Manchukuo Representative Explains Ten-Year Construction Plan</p>
<p>The East Asian nations maintaining their inherent self-awareness is a historical inevitability that no force can prevent. Only the establishment of Manchukuo can enable the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere to take the strongest and most powerful step. Here, I would like to discuss the basic issues of Manchukuo's policies over the next ten years, explaining them in three points: First, for ethnic harmony, Manchukuo is united by Japan, Manchukuo and other ethnic groups, and this is completely different from the imperialist control of other ethnic groups by Britain and the United States. Second, to guard the north, the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere is not only to complete our national defense. Our country is located in the northern border of East Asia. It is extremely important to complete the co-defense to ensure that there is no insecurity. Our country has signed a mutual defense treaty with the Japanese Empire, forming a strong posture, which is a most important mission. Third, to stabilize the people's lives and train the people, the Manchukuo government has been rapidly unified since its establishment. The previously chaotic currency system has been successfully unified, and prices have been stabilized, ensuring the stability of the people's lives. At the same time, efforts are being made to establish security. Fourth, to develop industries, the Manchukuo government began implementing a five-year industrial development plan in the fifth year of its establishment, overcoming all difficult objective conditions. This plan was completed last year, and the second five-year plan has begun this year. Today, we must deeply recognize that completing the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere is the only opportunity given to us by heaven. We, the billion East Asian people, should use the spirit of common unity to mobilize the resources of Greater East Asia, carry out construction during the war, and carry out war during construction, then the final victory will surely belong to us.</p>
<p>Philippines Willing to Supply Materials to Cooperate in Completing the War</p>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch) - During the Greater East Asia Conference, Philippine representative Laurel delivered a speech, stating that, looking back on history, what I regret most is why a conference of East Asian nations could not be held earlier. Now, the nations of Greater East Asia are gathered together, which is truly unprecedented in history. Establishing the Co-prosperity Sphere is not solely for the benefit of Japan itself, nor is it for the establishment of a Co-prosperity Sphere for other specific countries. The fundamental concept of the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere lies in recognizing the autonomy and independence of each member country to create a Co-prosperity Sphere. The three key principles of the Co-prosperity Sphere are coexistence, cooperation, common prosperity, and seeking the right to survival for all nations in the world. The reason for Japan's current war is to uphold the right to survival of the East Asian nations. I firmly believe that although Japan is thriving, if the East Asian nations are on the verge of suffering and extinction, then Japan will also feel unhappy. The fundamental concept of Japan's Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere is to seek common prosperity and growth with the nations of East Asia, so we must cooperate to build this Co-prosperity Sphere.</p>
<p>Here, I represent the Philippine Republic in declaring that, in order to carry out the Greater East Asia War, we will resolutely provide the spiritual and material elements that the Philippines can offer. Finally, let me say one thing: may our nations and peoples of Greater East Asia be united in mind and spirit, with the determination to complete the Greater East Asia War and overcome any obstacles and oppressions. Soon, when Japan achieves victory, the countries of Greater East Asia can jointly advance hand in hand.</p>
<p>Burma Vows to Fight to the End in the Face of a Formidable Enemy</p>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch) - During the Greater East Asia Conference, Burmese representative Prime Minister Ba Maw delivered a speech, with the following key points: He strongly emphasized the great significance of the Greater East Asia Conference, stating: This conference is epoch-making in East Asian history and a great transformation in world history, symbolizing the concrete gathering of the new harmony and economic construction foundation of East Asia. He reviewed the events that led to the unity of East Asia. He advocated that all East Asian nations should recognize the deep kindness bestowed by Japan. The construction of the Greater East Asia Sphere has not yet been completed and must be overcome, and he pointed out one or two shortcomings. He then mentioned the current resistance of India to anti-Asian elements, stressing that without a free and powerful India, there would be no free and powerful Burma, and without a powerful Burma, there would be no free and powerful Asia. He strongly stated Burma's views on the Greater East Asia War and the new order of Greater East Asia, saying that the construction of the new East Asia must be completed under the fires of this war. Asia has only two paths: victory or destruction. If the East Asian nations can unite and rise up, any difficulties can be easily solved, any war can be won, and any peace can be achieved. Now, Burma is on the front line of Greater East Asia, facing a formidable enemy and experiencing the horrors of modern warfare. However, this war is not only for Burma but for all of East Asia, so Burma is determined to work hard to the end. At the same time, he deeply hopes that all countries in East Asia will give their full support to Burma and form a common front in Burma. Only in this way can the self-strengthening and self-reliance of East Asia be realized. At the same time, East Asia can defeat any enemy and enemy group and create a new East Asian order and destiny.</p>

The fundamental purpose of the youth movement</p>
<h3>Coal Crisis Occurs in Southwest Chongqing Area</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, Daily Central News Agency dispatch - According to the Guilin Dagongbao, a coal shortage, the worst in years, has recently occurred in the southwestern Chongqing area. The Yuehan, Xianggui, and Qiangui railways have had several trains suspended. The Hengyang power plant was without power for a week, and factories in various cities have also largely ceased operations due to insufficient power. The reasons are multifaceted: the water drainage equipment in various coal mines in the southwest is inadequate, resulting in a large amount of water accumulation, making most of them unable to be mined. Land and water transportation agencies are busy transporting food supplies, and accumulated coal cannot be transported out. Many coal miners have switched to other occupations due to dissatisfaction with their treatment, causing a labor shortage in various coal mines. Coal merchants believe that coal is a rare commodity and are actively engaging in hoarding. As a result, the general public is using candles instead of electricity, and the price increases are triggered by the lack of power.</p>

The entire Vatican staff and the people of Rome expressed extreme indignation.</p>
<h3>India's Food Crisis Intensifies, British Authorities Helpless</h3>
<p>On November 1st, Wavell assumed the great mission of formally taking office as Governor-General of India, attempting to use autocratic politics to suppress the anti-British movement, solve the food problem, and eliminate social unrest, expand India's military production to serve as an arsenal and supply base for the Indian army counterattacking Burma and Mountbatten's Southeast Asian Anti-Axis forces, and strive for increased food production to thoroughly strengthen India as a base for counterattacks. However, since Wavell took office, the food crisis in eastern and southern India has intensified, and the resulting social unrest and anti-British sentiment have reached their peak. This analyzes the food problem that the Indian people see as cruel, examines the reasons why the Indian people are being forced to this miserable situation, and looks forward to its future.</p>
<p>Alarming Number of Starvation Deaths</p>
<p>First, let's look at the shocking figures presented by the British. It was reported in the British Parliament that as many as 1,000 people were starving to death in Bengal in a single week. According to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, from August 16th to October 12th (over eight weeks), 2,492 people starved to death in Calcutta alone, and 4,792 people died on the streets due to hunger and other causes. Taking this number as a standard, estimating the total number of starvation deaths in Bengal Province, Calcutta has a population of about 1.5 million people, and Bengal Province has about 50 million people. According to this proportion, at least about 150,000 people starve to death. Is that figure too large if about 150,000 people starve to death every week? Currently, those receiving food supplies from the government are estimated to be 90,000 in Calcutta and 1.7 million in Bengal, so this estimate cannot be considered too large. Also, if we go back to February of this year, when the food problem had not yet reached such a difficult point, the number of starvation deaths in Mumbai, Madras, and other places exceeded 10,000, so the figures estimated above are perhaps the lowest estimates. What are the reasons for this situation? First, due to inferior natural disasters, the sharp increase in exports and the cessation of imports, the supply of materials does not meet the needs of the people.</p>
<p>Disasters and Rising Prices</p>
<p>Due to the anti-British narrative, the reduction in labor force is neither an organized movement nor a spontaneous outbreak, but a natural disaster. Most recently, in mid-July, a major flood turned 70 villages in the Pultun region of Bengal into ruins. In early August, a severe windstorm struck the regions of Lac酉晋逹那, killing and injuring 50,000 people, rendering the land unable to be cultivated for five years. Another flood in the Paqi Mamer region of Orissa caused thousands of deaths. Most recently, since October 10th, a flood has caused disasters, inundating the entire city of Madras and the land 50 kilometers to the south, killing 3,000 and affecting 75,000 people. These disasters naturally add to the food insecurity.</p>
<p>The fall of Burma led to the loss of 2 million tons of rice. Looking at the transportation problem, India had to adopt a cellular transportation system, but India's 500,000 small villages are scattered and lack railways and modern roads. The only means of transportation is heavy trucks. But that is often not possible to operate in the rainy season. The flow of food and other materials is not smooth, so as long as there is a slight early sign, the consumption area immediately shows the color of hunger. Finally, the most fatal to the Indian people is the explosion of food prices. The above-mentioned situation is the result of malignant inflation, and food prices in India have exceeded ten times the pre-war level. This is the biggest threat to the Indian people, whose annual income is only 45 Lupi. Due to Britain's unrelenting exploitation, the people who are forced to live the lowest life, the average age in 1881 was 30 years old, and recently it dropped to 23 years old. It can be seen that their physical fragility and unhealthy. Jin Di Liang is exhausted, and there is no reason for the people not to fall to death. But India is not without rice, and the food is quite abundant, but due to the unsmoothness of transportation, it is biased to one place, and the hoarding of military rice, there has been food hunger with food.</p>
<p>British Empire on the Road to Self-Destruction</p>
<p>The current food difficulties are caused by the above reasons. According to another report, addiction and tiger plague are very common. The tragic situation in India is truly unbearable to behold. Of course, all of this has made the lives of the Indian people extremely poor, and it is the absolute responsibility of British imperialism. This is all caused by low wages, war, and the devaluation of silver. All in all, this is the result of excessive exploitation for the war. With no countermeasure to this situation, British imperialism is now tasting the bitter fruit it has sown itself.</p>
<p>Faced with the Japanese army perched on the Alahan Mountains and the Tiger Kingdom's Kyrgyzstan Delta, Britain cannot but use a hodgepodge of troops from Chongqing, India, the United States, and Africa to fight. At the same time, for the Indian National Army, which possesses modern weapons and abundant supplies, Britain cannot but grasp the Indian masses who are starving and shouting anti-British slogans. Britain has repeatedly said that the food problem is not a political problem, but the hunger this time, from its causes, is the biggest political problem. And it is a historical problem that exceeds the political power of Wavell and Churchill.</p>
<p>The worsening food problem will be the historical judge, declaring the crimes of 300 years of British imperialism ruling India and its downfall. The British Empire, founded on the exploitation of India, is therefore rapidly embarking on the road to self-destruction. (翔:  White October 25 Tokyo Honesty Report</p>

<h3>Outline of the Greater East Asia Declaration - Mayor Chen's Remarks - Conforms to the Revolutionary Goals of the Founding Father</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch - After the release of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, all sectors of Shanghai were extremely excited. Central News Agency reporters visited Mayor Chen at his residence yesterday to ask about his feelings about the Joint Declaration. He made the following remarks: "...I was not only personally excited about the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, but also all 450 million Chinese people were also extremely excited. Although the published guidelines are concise in five articles, they are comprehensive and can serve as the foundation for the eternal cooperation of all ethnic groups in Greater East Asia and the cornerstone for the stability of Greater East Asia. The first guideline indicates the unity of Greater East Asia, taking the spirit of justice as an opportunity, sweeping away Western utilitarianism, and regarding the harm to other countries as one's own benefit. The second guideline, mutual respect for autonomy and independence, allows each nation to exert its ability to cooperate in defending East Asia, which refutes the previous British and American rumors that the Greater East Asia War was a colonial scramble. The third guideline, respecting the creativity of all nations, is the root spirit of national self-determination. Only when each nation can maintain its creativity can it contribute to the world. The fourth guideline, based on the principle of reciprocity, promotes economic development, which is a clear indication of anti-British and American plots. Only with reciprocity can there be common prosperity, which is an easy principle. The sixth guideline stipulates the abolition of racial discrimination, the popularization of universal culture, and the opening of resources. The unique spirit of this guideline lies in the abolition of racial discrimination. With this guideline, not only will countries be equal, but humanity will also be equal. From this joint declaration, I can truly understand the original constitution and its importance of the Greater East Asia War. The outline of this declaration not only conforms to the purpose of Mr. Sun's revolution but also conforms to the ideals of all the Chinese people. I have no regrets about this declaration and deeply hope that all my people will do their best to support its implementation. In this way, the revival of China and the defense of East Asia can be achieved in a short time to complete its great and sacred mission."</p>
<p>The Whole City's People Are Excited and Inspired</p>
<p>The Greater East Asia Conference, where the six countries of China, Japan, Manchukuo, Thailand, the Philippines, and Burma gathered together, was solemnly held in Tokyo, Japan on the 5th of this month. The East Asian nations were united in mind and spirit, sincerely united, and cooperated with each other to build a new order in Greater East Asia, creating a great cause. The conference was unprecedented in its grand scale and created a new era for Greater East Asia. The conference unanimously and enthusiastically passed the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration at 2:55 PM yesterday (the 6th), which further promoted the consolidation of unity among the East Asian nations. After the news of the release of the joint declaration reached this city, people from all walks of life in the city were excited, deeply inspired, and vowed to work together for the coexistence and co-prosperity of Greater East Asia in order to eradicate the evil forces of the common enemies of East Asia, Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>The Financial Community Unanimously Supports</p>
<p>The financial and industrial communities in this city were excited after hearing the news and unanimously endorsed the declaration. Based on the principle of equality and reciprocity among the nations of Greater East Asia, they will closely cooperate, contribute their economic resources and the spirit of the nation, and use their spirit as a support, especially to actively seek to increase production and promote the development of economic construction to enrich resources and complete the prosperity of Greater East Asia. In order to help each other in the Greater East Asia countries, we will strive to complete the Greater East Asia War in order to get rid of the extremes of the United States and protect the Greater East Asia Declaration based on self-preservation and self-defense. The education sector in this city is extremely touched and unanimously expressed support.</p>
<p>Fly Flags for One Day to Show Support</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government issued the following notice: "Today, the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration was released. The city should hang flags for one day to show its support. All citizens are hereby notified." Last night (the 6th), the Municipal Propaganda Office posted slogans and the full text of the declaration on various roads and streets.

<h3>Matsushima Fleet Public Relations Director Talks About the Significance of Naval Battles</h3>
<p>Japanese Army Exerts Strong Combat Power</p>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch - After the Japanese General Headquarters announced the results of the naval battle of Bougainville Island on the 5th, it announced the results of the air battle over the sea off Bougainville Island on the 6th. This has a major impact on the British and American Pacific counter-offensive operations and the counter-attack operations against Burma. Colonel Matsushima, the Public Relations Director of the Japanese Fleet stationed in China, talked about the significance of the two battles yesterday, first saying: The focus of the British and American operations is to attempt to capture Bougainville Island, our last stronghold in the Solomon Islands, while at the same time conducting operations on the northern coast of New Guinea. If successful, they will then seize Rabaul, which occupies a place in our strategic group, which is what the imaginers assumed. It is estimated that the enemy's air power concentrated on that side is about 1,000 aircraft. As for the ships, a large unit with battleships as flagships is active, and Marines are continuously being transported, seeking to use superior air power to gain air superiority and to attempt to land on the country</p>
<p>Huge Loss</p>
<p>However, the enemy's past sacrifices seem to be too great compared to the slowness of this combat operation. According to the damage announced by the General Headquarters on the 5th, one or two large cruisers, three to four destroyers, over forty landing boats, two large transport ships were sunk or bombed, and three to four large cruisers, three destroyers, two large transport ships, and many other small boats were damaged. In addition, ten enemy aircraft were shot down. Our side lost only one destroyer, one cruiser slightly damaged, and fifteen aircraft that were self-detonated or did not return. The General Headquarters announced the results of the air battle on the 6th, which is even more astonishing, with greater losses than in the enemy's previous battles.</p>
<p>Bleeding Operation</p>
<p>Colonel Matsushima stated that the Solomon front, in our opinion, is not a place to exert the most powerful combat power due to distance. However, the enemy uses New Guinea or Australia as its stronghold, maintaining the shortest distance from the Solomon Flame Front. Therefore, we have to make strategic advancements. This kind of combat is the so-called "bleeding operation", so the wreckage of ships and aircraft lost by the enemy can almost fill the seabed of the Solomon Islands, and the loss of human resources is also quite alarming. This is the great victory of the Bougainville air battle. The combat power of our naval aviation unit is to kill the enemy. It can be said that it is a symbol of our increasingly powerful combat power. Now the enemy is increasingly approaching the center of our base. This is our original desire. Such great victories can be expected to continue forever in the future.</p>

<h3>First Bureau Economic Section Adjusts Structure</h3>
<p>The Economic Section of the First Police Bureau has always strictly managed the financial, economic, and commercial sectors within the First District. Now that the police administration of the 1483 District has been unified, the Section's role in economic matters has become even more important. Therefore, its internal structure has also been adjusted. Originally, it had five sections: Documentation Section, Intelligence Section, First Price Control Section, Second Price Control Section, and Materials Section. The First and Second Price Control Sections have been merged into a single Price Control Section. There have also been slight adjustments to the personnel of the section chiefs. Zheng Zhong is the chief of the Intelligence Section, Tan Wuhua is the chief of the Price Control Section, Chen Shuang is the chief of the Materials Section, and the chief of the Documentation Section has not yet been determined. As for the responsibilities of each section, the Documentation Section is responsible for document and general affairs, the Intelligence Section is responsible for investigating the activities of the financial and economic sectors and the application matters of economic organizations' gatherings, the Price Control Section is responsible for investigating price adjustments and evaluating the prices of all goods, and the Materials Section is responsible for investigating and managing various materials.</p>
<h3>Two-Percent Surtax on Tobacco and Alcohol Abolished This Month; Unified Collection of Tobacco and Alcohol Tax in the Eighth District</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report: In order to adjust tax policies and increase national revenue, the Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance has gradually changed various consolidated and special taxes from specific duties to ad valorem duties. As a result, tax revenue has increased daily, and at the same time, various unnecessary taxes and those that conflict with laws and regulations have been abolished. It is learned that the Jiangsu Province Stamp Tax Bureau for Tobacco and Alcohol recently issued an order stating that since the tax on local tobacco and alcohol is now collected uniformly, the existing two-percent provincial surtax on local tobacco and alcohol should be abolished. The order directs that the abolition be implemented starting from November 1st of this year. It is reported that after receiving the order, the bureau has instructed its subordinates to comply and has announced it to all merchants for their information.</p>
<p>Eighth District Deadline for Filing Applications</p>
<p>In the past, when the Eighth District was under the jurisdiction of the French Municipal Council of the former French Concession, there was a Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Inspection Office. However, after the takeover of the Concession, the Shanghai Liquor Brewing and Sales Association and others petitioned the authorities to abolish it. The municipal authorities deemed its establishment unnecessary and ordered the Eighth District Public Office to abolish the Inspection Office. However, the tobacco and alcohol license tax is originally a national tax, which is now handled by the local government. It has been collected by this city for many years and is now collected uniformly by the Municipal Finance Bureau. Therefore, all tobacco and alcohol merchants and shops in the Eighth District have been surveyed by the bureau. The tax collection will begin in the winter of this year. A Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Collection Office has been specially established at 177-9 Lingbao Road (formerly Route Pichon) in the Eighth District. The deadline for all businesses dealing in liquor and foreign wine to bring their business licenses and the most recent monthly tax receipt to the office to obtain application forms and submit them in the prescribed manner for investigation and license issuance is the 15th of this month. The original monthly tax license fee for this license tax has been changed. Yesterday, the news was released at 8:10 AM.</p>

<h3>Large Quantities of Chicken, Duck, Fish, and Meat Prohibited from Being Stored in Cold Storage; Materials Investigation Committee Cracks Down on Hoarding</h3>
<p>The prices of chicken, duck, fish, and meat have been rising daily, greatly affecting people's lives. Investigations show that there have been no obstacles to the supply of chicken, duck, fish, and meat, and transportation from the countryside is also very smooth. The price increases are therefore clearly due to manipulation. The Materials Investigation Committee is now paying attention to suppressing the prices of chicken, duck, fish, and meat, and has sent a letter to the Municipal Government to instruct the relevant bureaus to strictly prohibit the storage of large quantities of chicken, duck, fish, and meat in cold storage plants, which is tantamount to hoarding.</p>

<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3>Mergers of Companies and Banks</h3>
<p>All economic lifelines in Allied Japan, a leading industrial and commercial nation in the world, depend on it. Japan's wartime production is something to be proud of. Its general economic structure is even a model for the wartime controlled economic system. Taking the mergers of companies and banks as an example, in wartime Japan, all financial institutions, trust companies, general banks, banks, and money shops in the same city can be merged to rationalize enterprises and personnel and reorganize shops. However, for the convenience of the people's receipt and payment, branch offices can be set up. In order to take a step toward controlling finance, the merger regulations must be strictly enforced. In terms of national policy, not only can funds be concentrated, but also the past business competition, chaotic steps, and secret speculation can be completely eliminated.</p>
<p>In order to effectively implement the financial control policy and rectify the financial structure, our country's financial authorities recently ordered banks with insufficient capital to increase their capital in accordance with the new regulations promulgated by the ministry within one and a half months. Those who fail to increase their capital by the end of this year will be subject to appropriate penalties, and in serious cases, they may be ordered to suspend business. Such a strict measure to rectify financial institutions is in line with the requirements of the wartime economic system. However, according to statistics, there are as many as 266 large and small banks in this city. It is inevitable that some of them have unsound organizations. On the one hand, banks with insufficient capital can be ordered to increase their capital. On the other hand, we can also deliberately imitate Japan's method of merging companies and banks in the same city to adjust finance more collectively. The issue of "merging small banks" was once a popular topic in the past, but the actual performance does not seem to be very clear.</p>
<h3>Stock Exchange to Open Tomorrow; Trading Method Determined; Morning Trading, Afternoon Market Closed</h3>
<p>After being ordered to prepare for resumption of business, the Chinese Stock Exchange, in addition to holding a resumption ceremony on September 29, has completed all preparations. It is allowed to open on the 8th (Monday). The trading hours are tentatively set from 9:30 AM to 12:00 PM. All Chinese stocks that have been reviewed, approved, and approved are listed. Each broker is allowed to enter the market with a certificate, and each broker is allowed to send one agent. Customers are not allowed to enter the market. The listed stocks are opened and auctioned in order. After the opening market is announced,</p>
<p>Continuous Trading</p>
<p>(Note: That is, the continuous trading method of various stock companies now.) The final transaction price is the closing market. The market of various stocks must be recorded on the blackboard and at the venue. Only spot transactions are allowed. Whether bought or sold, it must be clear the next day. In addition to collecting fees in accordance with the provisions of the business rules,</p>
<p>Transaction Tax is to be Collected</p>
<p>"Valuable securities are taxed according to the price. The amount below one yuan in the price should be calculated according to one hundred yuan. Spot goods are charged at six ten-thousandths of the purchase and sale price, and futures are charged at four ten-thousandths of the contract price." All transactions this time are spot goods, so it is decided to collect at six ten-thousandths. The brokerage is responsible for collecting half of the tax from the buyer and seller and submitting it to the exchange for summary. If the brokerage fails to collect and pay or pays insufficient amounts, the exchange should be responsible for paying on behalf of the brokerage. It is also reported that there will be no ceremony for the opening of the market on the 8th. However, the directors, supervisors, and supervisors of the exchange will be present to supervise the transaction. Everything will be handled in accordance with the business rules.</p>
<p>Stock Market Installation</p>
<p>The Chinese Stock Exchange decided to start trial auctions on the 8th, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is learned that the exchange authorities have installed a market broadcasting device in the market for the convenience of brokers to transmit market information to the business locations of various brokers accurately and quickly. This is very important for the business of brokers. It is reported that this project is contracted by Datong Business Company on Jiangxi Road. The exchange has notified brokers who want to install broadcast splitters to register with the exchange within two days.</p>
<h3>Only 24 Kinds of Controlled Medicinal Raw Materials</h3>
<p>Since the Municipal Economic Bureau handled the registration of major commodities last month, there have been many rumors about the unification of new drugs. After investigation with the Shanghai New Drug Industry Association and the Pharmaceutical Factory Industry Association, it is learned that only 24 kinds of medicinal raw materials are under control. The registration of major commodities handled by the Economic Bureau this time in the new drug industry is limited to these 24 kinds. There are countless kinds of medicinal raw materials. In addition, according to the statistics of the names of all medicines used by Cheng Rong pharmaceutical companies, there are about 60,000 to 70,000 kinds. Therefore, it is not difficult to imagine the impact of the regulated medicinal raw materials on the entire new drug range. The above 24 items are listed in detail as follows: Aspirin tablets, Boric acid powder beads, Salicylic acid, Sodium benzoate caffeine, Castor oil, Sulfur, Ipecacuanha, Anesthetic ether, Hexamethylenetetramine, Hydrogen peroxide, Ichthammol, Iodine, Iodoform, Cresol, Red dye, Carbolic acid, Baking soda, Vitamin B, Yellow vaseline, Zinc oxide.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Approves Interpretation, Revises Banking Capital Laws</h3>
<p>The Inter-Bank Association previously submitted to the Ministry of Finance for interpretation, as there were still unclear points in the Ministry of Finance's revision of the banking capital laws for various banks. The reply from the Ministry of Finance is recorded below: The revision of various banking regulations concerning capital amounts is mainly based on the revision of the bank registration charter, and the revision of the company law governing banks is secondary. The reason for the revision of Article 3 of the above-mentioned bank registration charter is that the capital limit originally stipulated in the bank registration charter, when compared with the current commodity price index, should be raised to an amount not less than that stipulated in the revised charter. The second item of the revised charter stipulates that the capital must be at least 6 million yuan. According to the company law, 3 million yuan, accounting for one-half of the selling price, is qualified. The original intention was to avoid excessive disturbance. If necessary, the Ministry may order the remaining 3 million yuan that has not been received to be fully collected, without the need for further capital increase procedures. This is more flexible. If ordinary banks also engage in savings and trust businesses, they should each increase their capital by at least 1 million yuan in addition to the above-mentioned recognized capital in order to take care of both. The various statements listed in the report should be based on the first statement. The various capital limits in the tenth item refer to the lowest amounts. If the par value of the shares is odd, the total capital or paid-up amount may be appropriately increased for adjustment. According to Chen Qianqing, it is hereby ordered that you be informed and that you pass this on to others for their information. This is the approval.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stocks Trend</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks trading on Saturday was not dull, and the trend of buying and selling was even more prevalent. Therefore, the prices of new and old stocks diverged. Jingfu Socks, Jinglun Socks, Standard Monosodium Glutamate, Jiu'an Industrial, China Film, and Guohua Investment were all targets of buying and selling. However, stocks such as Wing On Textiles and Department Stores were sluggish. Major players were waiting for the resumption of trading at the stock exchange tomorrow. Everyone's hearts were secretly monitoring the situation. Today, the prices of textiles and Wing On Textiles opened high but fell back to flat; China Textile and Xinyi also saw slight declines, with the latter retreating near the border; Xinfeng and Dagong have stabilized; Lunhua and Tianlun saw higher prices again; Hongsheng Weaving was flat; Hongxing rose slightly; Jingfu Socks has exceeded the par value by more than one time, and the buying interest is still strong; Jinglun's increase was also strong, with a high of around 90% of par value. New Drugs: Xinya Pharmaceutical rose sharply in the morning and evening, but then fell back, and in the end both it and China-France saw increases; Xin Xing also rose to a high of 75% of par value; Xinyi also rose; Wuzhou, China-West, and Jiufu Pharmaceuticals were all flat.</p>
<p>Industry: Investors were active in Great China Matches; Nanyang and Huacheng Tobacco Company were still flat; Jiu'an Industrial was still rising amid buying pressure; Xin Ya Construction was also selling at a premium with right buyers; Guohua Investment opened high at 65% of par value; Standard Monosodium Glutamate rose to 90% of par value; Kang Yuan Manufacturing also saw buying pressure rise at noon, immediately rising; Meilin Canned Food and Guanshengyuan both saw increases.</p>

<h3>The Issue of Chinese Equity in Foreign Businesses</h3>
<p>— Lu Fei</p>
<p>At this time when the Allied authorities are actively transferring enemy property to the National Government, we would like to present the issue of Chinese equity in foreign businesses to the Allied and National Government authorities from the standpoint of the people. We sincerely hope that it can be resolved reasonably within a certain period of time, and that the authorities will give it thoughtful and reasonable consideration.</p>
<p>In the past, due to the backwardness of our country's industry and the turbulence of the political situation, the national industrial capital market, which is necessary for the development of industry and commerce and the revitalization of industry, has not been established. Therefore, the surplus funds of the Chinese people have been lured by foreign businessmen and concentrated in foreign markets. After the Sino-Japanese Incident, floating capital from various places continued to gather in Shanghai, and most industrial and commercial enterprises were affected by the war and were unable to make proper use of this surplus capital. Therefore, during the period until the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the amount of Chinese capital invested in various foreign businesses was enormous! After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, British, American, Dutch, and other foreign businesses were disposed of as enemy property and controlled by the Allied military authorities. The shares of Chinese investment in these enterprises were not subject to punitive measures. However, the fact that the dividends and profits of these businesses have been suspended to this day, the transfer of ownership has been stopped, and the public market has been closed for various reasons has resulted in a situation similar to that of being treated as enemy property, with an indefinite freeze! Buying is impossible, transfers are hindered, and the principal and profits have no factual public guarantee. This alone has caused great distress to small and medium-sized investors.</p>
<p>Most of the enemy businesses in this city that have been subject to military management have resumed operations, except for a portion that has not yet resumed for various reasons. In recent years, prices have been rising steadily, and the production and operation of these businesses must also be very profitable. Therefore, we earnestly hope that the Allied enemy property management authorities will promptly and strictly pay the dividends and profits that Chinese investors deserve, based on the principle of equality and reciprocity. This will not only have a positive impact on the general public's psychology, but also greatly benefit the current economic difficulties faced by small and medium-sized merchants who have had difficulty borrowing money since the cloth was purchased. Moreover, some small and medium-sized investors used to have stable lives and savings and invested in businesses. Now, with high prices and difficulty maintaining their livelihoods, they are eagerly hoping to receive dividends and profits, or sell their shares to obtain money to meet other needs. Their eagerness cannot be described in words.</p>
<p>As for the continued processing of share transfer procedures, it is also a matter of urgency. In the nearly two years since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, many shares have changed hands frequently. In order to confirm the legal rights of investors, it is hoped that the managers of each enterprise will promptly resume handling transfer procedures. This will also provide legal protection for those who have lost their shares due to loss or other reasons.</p>
<p>If there is a concern that speculators may use the shares as chips after the transfer is facilitated, then they can directly participate in the auction of the Chinese Stock Exchange. In this way, the purchase and sale will be subject to public supervision and guidance, and the risk of speculation can naturally be avoided.</p>
<p>Finally, I have a few views on the Allied transfer of enemy property, which I would like to submit to the authorities.</p>
<p>The transfer of enemy property to our country's government is the result of a position based on reciprocity: This is something we should thank the Allies for. However, based on the standpoint of increasing production and increasing people's welfare, we hope that the Allied and National Government authorities can convert some productive enterprises that are closely related to people's daily lives into joint public-private ventures, or joint Chinese-Japanese public-private ventures, or public-private operations: The government should bear the equity of the enemy country's people, and send supervisors to assist the directors and supervisors elected by the Chinese shareholders to actively utilize various equipment and give them the greatest and most reasonable management. If they are short of funds and cannot cope, they can increase capital or the government can lend them low-interest funds. We must ensure that they benefit all the people and actively promote production. Most of these productive enterprises are light industries, such as: the textile industry, the paper industry, the brewing industry, and the chemical industry. Other enterprises of a public utility nature, such as electricity, lighting, tap water, trams, and public buses, should be jointly operated by the Chinese and Japanese governments, or solely by the Chinese government, or solely by the Japanese government, depending on what is actually in the best interests of the people and the two countries. As for the various enterprises in heavy industry, they can also be handled according to the above principles. If this is truly implemented, then we believe that it will greatly contribute to the production increase work that China and Japan are vigorously promoting, as well as the economic recovery of Central China! Here, we look forward to the future development of the situation!</p>

<h3>Mr. Wan Chunxian Generously Donates Prize Money to Aid the Poor and Support Education</h3>
<p>The Central Reserve Bank is managing a fixed-term savings lottery to encourage thrift among citizens. The China Cotton Corporation Bank, in accordance with the Central Bank's intentions, is making every effort to promote this lottery. Account holders enthusiastically participate, ensuring that all allocated numbers are subscribed to the full amount. It has come to our attention that Mr. Wan Chunxian, a depositor at the bank, has won the second prize with the number 8722, receiving a prize of 20,000 Central Reserve Bank notes. Mr. Wan believes that this money was not earned through hard work but was obtained through good fortune. Therefore, he voluntarily donates 2,500 yuan each, totaling 10,000 yuan, to the loan funds managed by the News Industry Association for scholarship halls, small-capital loan funds, and relief funds for the impoverished, as well as 2,500 yuan each, totaling 10,000 yuan, to the scholarship fund, poverty relief fund, elementary school teacher medical aid fund, and small-capital loan fund managed by the Shenbao newspaper, to contribute his meager efforts. He has now delivered the total prize money of 20,000 yuan to the Shenbao and Xinbao newspapers, entrusting them to forward the donations, thereby demonstrating the spirit of mutual assistance among people. (It is noted that Mr. Wan is likely not the only winner. It is hoped that other prize winners will also contribute, even small amounts, as accumulating small contributions can be very beneficial.)</p>
