<h3>社評　提倡科學救國</h3>
<p>本之近代工業，發軔於明治維新以後，其時間蓋與吾國會左李之提倡近代工業不相先後。以資源言，當時之日本遠不及中國。以聰明技巧言，中國人初不在日本人之下。然一則突飛猛進，早躋於世界工業國家之列；一則扶牀繞膝，依然不離孩提時代，其故安在？</p>
<p>居嘗中國工業之所以不能發達，其故有四：中國人民自視本身文化甚高，不肯虛心接受外來文化，用是有識者雖孜孜提倡於上，而短視者則切切腹誹於下，以致人存則政舉，人亡則政熄。如甘肅之織呢局，固左宗棠所苦心經營，而視為足以開中國毛紡業之先河者。但左一去任，旋即停閉。共他類此者，不勝枚舉。其故一也。士大夫階級，狃於以夏變夷之心理，以談洋務講新學為恥。如倭仁之奉命長同文館，雖不敢顯拒朝命，但終於就職時故意墜馬傷足，託病請辭，而當時所謂淸流者，且衆口交　，稱為不喪所守。共故二也。政治不修明，法律無保障，貪官汚吏，土豪劣紳，土豪勾結，以新具企業為魚肉之對象，以致未辦者窒息於萌芽，已辦者夭折於學步。其故三也。科學研究，費時久而耗力多，國內學校旣少完善設備，畢業學生尤難覓得出路，以致洽自然科學者日以少，治社會科學者日以多。事業與人材之缺乏，互為因果。其故四也。積此數因，而中國工業之發達，遂以落後數十年。</p>
<p>淸末以還，社會思想不變，一二兩項原因已不復存在。而法律之無保障，科學敎育之不發達，則尙未能　改舊觀。故投資者仍視企業為長途，而眞正辦理企業奢，則又動興才難之歎。欲糾斯弊，固須政治早上軌道，而培養人材，尤為當務之急。夫培養人材，誠非一朝一夕之事，然正唯如此，愈不能不及早着手。日本科學育之發達，百倍吾國，其育成之各級技術人材，不下若干萬人。然最近其閣議通過之敎育方策，仍謀重編自國民學校至大學之某統，增加理工科學生。覘彼覘此，我國朝野上下，當益知今後辦理敎育所應持之方針矣。</p>
<p>往昔上海大學中之以機工兩科著名，而設備亦最完善者，曰同濟，曰交通。其畢業學生在國內工程界中，均卓然有所貢獻。事變以還，前者遷往內地，後者亦以校舍及設備關係，學生不再有實騐之機會。其餘上海各大學中之設有理工兩科者，亦僅大同，聖約翰兩校，衡以國家未來之需要，與各校目前所能造就之人數，相差未免太遠。</p>
<p>夫培養技術人材，旣為當前急務，則擴充大學理工學額，强化中學理工基礎課程，皆為刻不容緩之圖。吾人於此，所擬提請政府社會注意者，為：</p>
<p>由政府以明令規定大學中理工學額與其他科系學額之比例，並以經補補助擴充實騐設備，暨交涉收回交大校舍。</p>
<p>由政府令知各省市主管敎育機關，嚴格監督各中學所授課程，尤其與理工基礎有關之各項課程。</p>
<p>由社會熱心敎育人士，提倡多設理工講座，供給優良師資，以補學校力量之不足。</p>
<p>請社會人士重視國家未來需要，多遣子弟研究自然科學。</p>
<p>由出版界　量編譯科學書籍，並以低廉價格供給學生，含國家社會之力量，共同致力於科學救國之一途，則科學之發達，國家之强盛，自有達到的之一日。</p>
<h3>組織國民使節團問日本</h3>
<p>中國國民外交促進會於昨日舉行理事會，議案中有組織國民使節團訪問友邦日本，同時，由褚部長即席說明組織使節團的意義及理由。我們早會主張以民間立塲，組織使節團訪問友邦日本。</p>
<p>本年七月友邦日本經濟界組織經濟使節團，來華訪問，與我國官方暨民間經濟界人士交換意見，對於兩國間經濟合作，不無裨助。為了更進一步密切聯繫起見，我們也應組織使節團答訪日本。因此，國民外交促進會發起組織使節團訪問，是極合時宜的舉措。</p>
<p>自從大東亞戰爭爆發以至國民政府對英美宣戰以後，中日兩國的關係，在客觀上應是休戚相共，痛癢相關。然而，我們冷靜的觀察，還是親善合作的言詞，超過了親善合作的事實。兩國政府之間的親善合作，固屬重要；而兩國民間的精誠相與，同樣重要。國民外交，是以促成兩國民間的精誠相與為目的，而國民使節團的訪問，就是實踐國民外交的一端。所以，國民使節團的使命，就是溝通兩國民間意見而促進精誠合作。</p>
<p>鑒於上述客觀環境的需要，我們亟盼國民使節團從速成立，及早訪問，組織之前應充分準備訪問的程序，先事討論如何有利於兩國民間的合作？如何溝通兩國民間的意見？如何解除兩國民間的隔閡？以及如何取彼之長補我之短？切切實實提出問題，製成網要，以為訪問時的根據。深信友邦朝野正在迫切期待兩國的精誠合作，對於我們國民使節團的訪問，定必熱心指示，推誠商討，為我們解答問題。於此，我們率先提供數事，以為使節團訪問的課題</p>
<p>經濟事業，與民間最有直接關係，因此，經濟合作，為一切合作的先聲，亦為兩國民間聯絡情感與溝通意見的先聲，如何消除陣碍，加强經濟合作？應首先研究。</p>
<p>文化是表達一國的性格與特色，文化交流，有助於兩國民間的彼此認識與了解，效力殊大，也應特別注重。</p>
<p>日本國內政治，經濟，社會，敎育，文化等等，一切動態，均在整備決戰態勢的進程中，在在足供我們的借鏡與參考，訪問時就須虛心探討，觀察要領，詳細記錄。歸國後貢獻當局實施，完成戰時體制。</p>

<p>柏林十八日中央社電　據海通社訉：東綫於星期六有大規模之戰事，蘇軍在　里　　基至阿索大海一綫，繼　企圖突破德軍陣　，但未獲重要之勝利，被突破之各點　被德軍彌補，德軍並作反攻擊退敵軍。自德軍在南毀退出柴普　基，戰事之中心已移至西北方之尼普貝特洛夫斯克。蘇軍現集中生力軍於　普照營基，包括步兵十五師·量克車二百五十輛·大砲二百尊與大量戰鬥機，自橋頭發動進攻，蘇軍雖佔數量上之優勢，但卒為據軍砲火所擊退。蘇軍單在該區已損失，蘇軍司令不得不令其撤至後方重行部署，德軍於此次勝利中亦會相當之代價。</p>
<p>德防禦戰續獲勝利</p>
<p>柏林十八日中央社電　德國新聞社訉：中部聶伯河區蘇軍以强大之坦克車與步兵隊，企圖　展其在比萊斯拉夫附近聶伯河彎曲處之橋頭　，為德軍所阻，損失重大。　坦克車隊後隨步兵，由劇烈之急泊砲火掩護向前推進，當時德軍急以重攻砲調至前陣，向敵側　猛攻，而將其切斷，在半小時之內，蘇坦克車已有十八輛處於火　中而不能行動，蘇軍步兵企圖躱避於　餘坦克車之後未果，而為德軍之平射砲隊所殲滅。迨至中午敵坦克車三十八輛不能行動，步兵除小數不重要之集團外亦被殲滅，於是敵之進攻途告中止。蘇軍在基輔之西北以强大之步兵与坦克车隊，企圖穿入該城內德軍之後方交通，當時在崎　不平之森林區之凹陷處，卽發生極激烈之戰爭，敵之猛攻暫時稍有進展，不久即為當堆後備兵所阻，此等後備兵立即發動反攻，而收復以前落入蘇軍手中之交叉路。普利伯河口蘇軍為收復其前數日所失去之領土起見，以若干强大之部队包括坦克車與摩托化分遺隊，在各據點同時企圖穿入德軍之陣綫，其中一隊遭德軍巧妙之側面行動所包圍而被殲滅，同時敵另一分隊則被擊退至原陣地，而被迫放棄其至部配備與重兵器。</p>
<p>分遺行動成績特佳</p>
<p>柏木十八日中央社電　德軍高級司令部於星期日中午發表公報稱：十月十五日所報告德軍由柴普營基橋頭堡之撤退，係根據東綫大分遺行動中之原定計劃而實行者。分遺部隊之各領袖與軍隊本身對於實行此項行動，均有特住之成　，一切武器，戰具，給養品與工具，均運過在敵陸空軍威脅下之聶伯河橋梁，德工兵對於破壤重要之軍事設備，實行渡河，與及時炸毀河提與橋梁，與有特殊之貢獻，蘇軍在梅立　波爾兩旁這緊强攻勢被擊退，敵作戰集團在反攻中被殲滅，我軍擒獲戰俘六百四十八名，　獲大砲五十　。克里曼　之東南，蘇軍於昨日（十六日）以强大之兵力，繼續作突破之企圖，在激戰中敵軍全　被擊退，局部突破處均加以切斷，敵坦克車被毀一百二十輛以上。契尼柯夫之西北與斯倫斯克之西，激戰仍在進行中，其劇烈之程度不减於前。在激烈之防禦戰中，敵無法獲得任何成功，蘇軍損失重大。</p>
<h3>義境德軍採用　巧妙防禦戰術　遏阻反軸心軍北進</h3>
<p>柏林十八日中央社電　德國新聞社訉：反軸心軍十四日曾猛攻伏爾托諾及亞平　山脈兩地區之德軍陣地，是役反軸心軍蒙受甚大損害，克拉克將軍所部美第五軍兵向海岸地區遺退。伏爾托諾西方美軍坦克車步兵聯合部隊亦曾作攻勢，兵力雖相當雄厚，但　能突破德軍第一綫陣地，北進企圖終告失敗。又反軸心軍之增援部隊，擁有坦克車五十輛，曾於十五日在伏爾托托諾北方登陸，但未能接近德軍陣地，德軍已自卡普亞地區若干陣地撤退，移駐於伏爾托諾北端高地，且以絕妙之防禦作戰，到處制止反軸心之進攻，雙方戰鬥漸形白熱化。同時自　查經亞平青山脈通羅馬之沿路地區，反軸心軍過去二三日間　陸績調集有力之步兵及坦克車部隊。甘波巴索方面之英加聯軍，十六日突對德軍山地陣地開始攻勢，德軍為免受反軸心軍包圍，乃破壤一切軍事設施，向後方陣地撤退，文插特爾地區之德軍亦因受反軸心軍妨害撤退，反軸心軍目下頗有沿路徐北進之勢。但因德軍將進路切斷，其前時被阻，加以德軍砲兵部隊更作猛烈之砲擊，敵軍　益陷於混亂狀態。</p>

<h3>所羅門的艱苦作戰　在砲火大雨中轟擊敵人</h3>
<p>在倫特巴島登陸的美國軍隊，又進而侵入新佐治亞島，與皇軍不斷地進行着尸骨　野各血流成河的殘酷劇戰。記者是在敵人於倫特巴島登陸前二日，即六月二十八日，至新佐治亞島，在槍林彈雨中渡過蒙達，巴伊，而來到克倫班卡拉島，曾深深體騐到戰爭的各種深刻程度。下面就是我在砲烟彈　下繼續寫成的。</p>
<p>途中討厭的穴阱</p>
<p>我們到　蒙達的時候，正是敵人在倫特巴登陸前雨天，六月二十八日晨三時。船底突然吱的一聲被岸礁夾住。從船頭跳到岸上時，覺得晨曦的冷氣在侵襲着皮　。所羅門羣島現在正是冬天，跟日本的秋天相彷彿的氣候。在道路上不知碰到我少直徑一兩丈的大穴阱，委實令人討厭。這是敵人的轟炸機，不分晝夜盲炸的遺跡</p>
<p>爬過叢林，達到〇〇陸戰隊營。這是紅土的泥濘和珊瑚礁的岩盤相互參雜，且連棉不斷的一種坎坷道路，每天的伙食只是淡而無味的一湯，但這天早晨，規格外加上一點大頭　菜。在〇時的晨光，聽見在東南方隆隆的聲音。頃該間，〇〇架的飛　羣出現　叢林的上空。原來是本國飛機。多牛是擊　瓜　卡那爾島或魯塞　島的敵方根據地去。兵士們　都跑出兵營，致以　呼。</p>
<p>下午三時左右，在西北方，又起來一種隆隆的聲音。　聲逐漸逼近了。是敵人五十多架飛機的大編隊。在〇〇的背後，突然分成兩隊，　備轟炸了。岸綫一帶，完全成為砲烟和　土的地獄了。强烈的產風颯　撲到身上。敵　在十五分　內被擊〇時，無綫電拍來，報告「敵方大船隊北上中」的消息。我跑到洞內電話室去的時候，司令業已坐在折　椅子上了。一看到記者的影子，便笑着說：「終於來了」。從〇後〇瞭望臺，報告說敵人船隊進入倫特巴　了。敵人船隊是由五艘驅逐艦，六艘運輸船，十數隻魚雷艇及高速艇組威的，從運輸船上　下登陸用舟艇來。敵人開始登陸了，全副武裝的兵士咬着乾麵包，並喝着熱水瓶的水。看樣子，兵十們都很興奮。然而毫不慌張，無限的頑强性　心坎　湧同出来。從〇〇瞭望台下看　有　雲的倫荷巴島，非常清楚。用望遠鏡一看，馬上看到敵人在登陸用舟艇上，開足最大速度，繼續地登陸。在不知不覺地　間，道格拉斯型飛機六架在其上空盤旋　，繼而　數逐漸地增加起來。時間不大，在〇方面突然起來一陣砲烟，便天翻地覆地向埋伏於〇〇島的砲台陣地開始猛烈　　。敵方驅逐艦的向蒙達岬開駛。敵軍的子彈，拍拍地落在海岸綫上，激　濃厚的塵土。〇時〇〇分，我方戰鬥機在天空上　　的聲音，　於東方，抨抨：地機關槍聲，很清楚地可以聽得見。　來襲的飛機進行着壯烈的空戰。「擊落了一架敵　戰　機，機，飛機師用降落傘跳下來了」，「克拉曼式戰鬥機兩架被擊落，其中一機在空中粉碎」，瞭望員這樣報告着，這已足證明我方的絕對優勢。敵方船隊張起烟幕，開始退却了。抛棄下的登陸用　　，在倫特巴　來囘　　着。須臾間，在无空上又起来了大的震聲，在倫特巴港的上空　戒着。敵人藉數量上的優勢，而耀武揚威，眞覺可憎。下午〇時，敵方船隊又開如逃遁了，這是由於我方飛機又飛來了。</p>
<p>記者急忙跑到瞭望員那邊去看。在倫特巴島近海的天空上，我方飛　在雲務中　來　去，自由自在地表演着空戰。一架對剛架，或一架對四架，我方戰鬥機雖然佔着這親數盘上的劣勢，仍然果敢突然噴出黝黑濃烟，就在这刹那间，雪白的降落傘敞着向　面上慢慢落下云。敵機被一架一架地擊落了。瞭望員在喊叫着：「敵方驅逐艦二艘擊　「運　船一艘起火」。敵方船隊躱藏謚島的皆影處，眨眼間，四處全張　濛濛的黑烟來。我方的飛機編隊，凱旋而歸。敵　的聲音也聽不見了。激戰後的暫時寂靜，終謚降臨了。　並未能繼續十分鐘。</p>
<p>敵艦的頑强來攻</p>
<p>新的飛機聲音，起於〇〇山的背後。敵方轟炸機三十七浩浩蕩蕩向蒙　沿岸的防禦陣撲來。空中交綏十分　後，　　便被擊退了。敵方損失飛，六架，而我方一無損失。下午三時，敵方轟炸機又從北方　來，向海岸綫轟炸。敵方驅逐艦一艘出現　達南方的海面上，而魚雷艇十艘通過了萬加烏近海，這都是〇〇瞭望　報告出來的。這一天侵入緊連的敵機數目，共三百九十一架，侵入次數，共三十五次至四十次，攻擊機有六十架，其餘為偵察機。</p>
<p>企圖登陸的船隊</p>
<p>七月一日也　看不見太陽的陰天。於四時半，敵人船隊在驅逐艦和戰鬥機之掩護下，出現於倫特巴島附近，瞭望員報告說，此次好像是貨船。〇時〇〇分我方飛機起飛。對着敵人登陸的倫特巴港進行着猛烈的轟炸。在　洋的上空，喪　着劇烈壯絕的空戰。不大的工夫，在我方飛機編隊反歸原防的海洋上，敵人的高速艇開始搖擺了。也許是在救護被擊落的機行員。此時，敵方像浪潮上湧般地大批開始登陸。至夜晚，其登陸部隊的一部，　已前進到　達前面的安班巴島。敵方偵察機的聲音仍然旋繞天空。子夜時分，隆隆然的砲聲，在倫特巴島可以很清晰地聽得見。這是我主驅逐艦〇艘向倫特巴開始轟擊的聲音，結果擊沉和擊破兩艘魚雷艇。</p>
<p>七月二日是少有的晴天。敵方驅逐艦六艘和　愉船四艘，又進入了偷特巴港。於七時，倫特巴的敵人開始向蒙　砲轟。這是因為　砲業已安　就緒　致。〇〇參謀　〇〇砲台　打来电話，說「敵人沒有在便用毒瓦　麼」敵人是非常卑鄙的，任保事情都可能做出來。今天是陸軍重轟炸機跟敵方的戰鬥機始了空戰。轟炸機在倫特巴島實行俯　。敵方高射砲的安置早已就緒。不久後，在倫特巴港，昇起黝黑的濃烟。瞭望員說：「好像是火藥庫着火」。</p>
<p>午後八時，我方〇〇砲台一齊開始轟擊。這是因為發見了在蒙達彰面魯比安島附近，敵人企圖登陸的船隊。按〇〇瞭望員的報告，登陸舟艇有二十五隻被擊沉，敵兵零散地漂浮在海面上。我們陸戰隊的兵士們在擦着槍口，並磨着刺刀。他們共同的信念是「報瓜達卡那爾見之仇」。自從我到了蒙達以後有五天，而敵人登陸後有三天，在這個期間，我看到皇軍將士的英勇奮鬥，不知會幾度使我暗地裏流過敬佩和感激之涙。</p>
<p>叢林中傾盆大雨</p>
<p>晴天裏一聲　　，立刻黑雲密佈，傾盆大雨。這種南洋的一斯克爾營」雨，看樣子很不容易停。士兵們替我們搬鑵頭和汽水。但我閃堅決地不接受。只把一小袋乾麵包放在背　裏，向〇〇司令官司借來他護身用的軍刀，跟同伴小澤君（報道班員）福島君一塊兒在　　雨下山了。海路因為危險，　以便決定走從　人走的叢林地帶，向拜羅克出發。</p>
<p>橫越叢林地帶，這決不是一件容易事。如注的大雨，滲透了　　，這樣　　着雨水的　　，重　似乎增加了許多信，致肩骨有折斷之痛。泥濘沒膝，上山下山時往往滑倒，　入泥沼。在途中，　到了　　的增援部隊。和我們一樣，從笨重的得　　流　水，裏腿布和皮鞋，因泥的洨濕而有　　了。夜晚不能走，所以我們每天的旅程只走〇公里，在　軍的〇〇部隊中住了一宿。三號是雖然天晴了，但去時降着南方獨有的　雨「斯克爾　」，四號也是　此。我們在這兩天內，　過〇〇山，渡過〇〇谷，　破〇果的泥濘地帶，於四號的黃錯時分，竟自達到拜羅克的陸戰隊駐　過。</p>
<p>頭上敵人曳光彈</p>
<p>在拜羅克的上空也像焳達一樣，敵方偵察機的隆隆聲音，不斷在天空中旋繞。在當天夜裏，我們被〇〇本部的水兵引導着，在黑影中忽忽忙忙地向海岸走去，就在這個時候，突然逼近了一種笨重的飛機聲音，似乎是敵人的偵察機，於是我們就離開道路，而躱藏在樹林裏。接着起了一陣砲聲。是敵機開的砲。我閃就跑至叢林地帶裏去了。突然，火　打破了黑　，轟然一聲，好像地軸失掉了平衡。這是我們〇〇砲台所發的砲。</p>
<p>不久後，敵軍的子彈敲打着海岸綫，激起一種殘酷的聲音。海　看不見了。敵人的曳光彈好像火綫似地在頭上交織着，亂穿着。砲轟的聲音，一時弱，一時强，接接連連地一直繼續至翌五號上午三時，藍個期間內，傾盆的大雨，也不時光　，以　我們從　冷到了脚。不大　工夫，天空在開始發白，所以就牛農對泣囘到〇〇本部。士兵們全副武裝地準備着，目光全都炯炯地向叢林中注射着。也在準備着</p>
<p>敵運輸船隊擊潰</p>
<p>四號夜，在三艘巡洋艦和三艘驅逐艦的掩護之下，企圖在拜羅克雨近　陸的敵方大船隊，進入了克拉　。怡好在這個時候，在克倫班卡拉島柬北海面上經過的我方驅逐艦〇艘，早已看清楚了這些　影。敵人的船隊是在克倫班卡拉島各拜羅克的中間海洋上航駛着，最前面是巡洋艦，其次是驱逐艦，殿後为运愉船隊。突然火　一閃，敵人就向　倫班卡拉開如轟擊了。裝備在克倫班卡拉島的我閃砲台，也就起而　戰。我閃的驅逐艦帶着特殊任務，艦首衝人克拉　，而不　反復地放魚雷。頭號艦的瞭望兵看見兩個巨大的水柱，在敵方巡洋艦的船身上高高地昇了起來。</p>
<p>敵人　這一攻擊，打得落共流水。同時我閃拜羅克處的砲台也發揮了　烈的砲火。於是　艦隊開始棄亂了陣形，實行後退了。躱至賴斯灣的背後去，仍然向拜羅克進行着砲戰。竟展開了　烈無　的砲戰。我閃是伏在叢林中靜聽這一砲戰的。在遇個期間，敵方運輸船隊從船上放下登陸舟艇，而介圖使陸軍登陸了。吧啦吧啦地舟艇相碰聲，在深夜　由海上傳來。我們的砲火就集中到這個聲音的地方。登陸舟艇相繼起火，而沉沒於黑暗的大海中。這一晚上我們的戰果，曾　沉巡洋艦一艘，　逐　一艘，　　未詳一艘。只是　方乘着黑夜，倖免於我砲火的一部份陸軍兵士，才得登陸，其餘全被打退了。</p>
<p>五號上午，僅僅聽到　達方面不砲聲和轟炸聲，但在拜羅克的上空却是很沉　。敵人只是近於在賴斯灣登陸，並未　所行動，在我們陸戰隊的男士們　　，當然沒有揚眉吐氣得眨眼的機會，所　竟自大睡去了。這天晚上，我們又辭別了〇〇　部，在　近海岸的〇〇隊中寄宿了。後黃錯起，又不新地開始下傾盆大雨。　（轉入第四版）</p>

<p>前公共和界保甲共分七區，屬於保甲委員會，租界政囘後，第一區保甲機構直屬於第一區警察局之保甲處，直接受保甲處之管轄，而八區則設立保甲分辦事處、因是兩區保甲行政能趨統一，至於市民組織之保甲委員會，則無執行之權，僅為保甲常局之諮詢機。</p>
<p>市民服役年齡規定</p>
<p>關於一市八民兩服區役民警·其年齡規定略有不同，一區規定較為嚴格，凡年自二十歲至四十五歲體格健全者·均須備崗，而八區則早規定服役年齡為自二十五歲至三十五歲，更須抽議輸値，但最近已更改，與一區相同，部二十歲至四十五歲之市民·有服役之義務。</p>

<h3>難童敎養收容所幼幼敎養院訪問記</h3>
<p>牛產的擴展</p>
<p>踏進院門，靠右側就是生產處，主席李鶴齡伏在寫字台上計　營業帳目，旁邊綱袋部的男女孩子們正有緊張地工作着。</p>
<p>據說起初時，曾以生庫工作為一種課程，可以訓練生產技能，以爲產生謀將來出路。但是限於某金，能參加的院生不多，收效　　不大。後來規定中高年級見童實行半工半讀，並為求該院經費上的補助，乃將生產股改組為生產處，並成立生產委員會，撥資六萬元為某金，擴大編製藤器及機器磨粉兩部、由李氏負賣學理進背，銷貨，管理　工作。生產運動展間以後，成績卓著，營業發達，每日銷貨竟當在一萬元以上，後來又添置新式磨粉機，於是生產工作漸成爲該院經濟上一種動力。生產　原發分設（一）磨粉、（二、籘工，（三）網袋三部，有職員三人，並聘有技工指導，凡參加工作的兒童，還分別奖勵津貼，代為儲存。</p>
<p>工部是最先成立的，代經擴充、參加工作的幾佔全院兒童　分之一，並隨時改進敎授　中、繼製請義，加强組織·促進管理完善·積極進行訓　，不久以前·一度在新閘路大通路口及　飛路一○五四號設立二個藤丁分銷處，產銷都有顯著的增加。現在雖已停止，但各大公司及商家還時向該院直接批辦　出品有桌，椅，床臻架，搖籃，坐車·熱水瓶殼等等，據說每一伴製成品都　過技師和管理員的　格檢查·質料技藝都在一般水準以上、而且少，所以傷價較戰，頗受各方　美。</p>
<p>磨粉部之設，也有年多的歷史，有七四半　力的小　馬達一等·是張春炎先生捐所的。當時院先得生產熱忱很高，他們自己的報告曾說「畢業生自己，他們很明白應當首先　　參加生產工作，鈴聲是磨粉部的工作信號，較上　，上午十一時二十分下午五時又安慰他們：，馬達、磨粉　在轟轟怒吼，一羣遇身沾着白粉的孩子們，靈活而熟練的分頭工作看，有的在磅·有的在揀，有的在篩，有的在磨，有的在裝·一可是，現在因為食糧統制等等原因，磨粉部巳暫時停　。</p>
<p>現在生產事業方面除了籘工部之外，就只有開辦最遲的綢袋部，但是成績　乎很好，　子們還自己組織推銷團，向各界宵傳暫責、有些批發商人，山鑒於　　出品之物美備廉而常常去批購。</p>
<p>徐公　分院的生產事業，則以農地　　爲主、他們巳　明佃了從前著名的江蘇鄉村師範的蘭塘農地，那裏有房縣基，有河水·可耕地也有二十餘畝、現在所種的毛豆，快到收獲時候，正在籌備種麥，並　擴大為四十四畝，沿河一帶所種各種蔬菜等已可仙分院自給自足了！</p>

<p>幼幼院　孩子們的生活，象徽着中國新生的前途。全體師生，每晨早會升旗，將晚夕會降旗、在莊嚴的　式中，大家感覺着自己對國家的責任·國旗在晨曦中升起，下面孩子們矯捷　進行着早操、　着、開始學業生活·特別有意義的是學業競賽。因為誰也不願落後，所以誰也有了進步。　說，由於合理的競賽·幾呼初進院　品質低劣的兒童，經過兩星　　練，就改變得很好了。</p>
<p>孩子們自己有兒童團的組織。以每天下午五時以後為活　時間。兒童團分設五部：　訓練部，　有幹訓練絲班，實行自治；　學術部，主持警報及圖書館等；　公安部，設有小注庭·糾察·巡運各隊，當你去參觀時，每級每班有孩子　導致敬，和軍事學校一般。　服務部，有勞動，衛生，看護、洗衣·烹飪等團。　康樂部，主持體育活動，棋子，歡詠，及乒乓隊等。</p>
<p>難童　自治能力之强，在幼幼院獲　充分的證　，大概由於野生野長　了。雖然很幼小的兒童，也會照料自己、而且很會組織起自己來、再加導師們的指敎·其成續使特別優良。</p>
<p>難童們更富於創造性，例　爲了物質缺乏、他們能運出技巧·把廢物改造成實用的東四，他們把用利的肥皂屑收集起來放在水裏燒一下，變成整　的肥皂；他們從破襪子袖綫搓絞個衣結　袋，他們政集　角片補衣·　至拚　　「錦衣」；他們更收拾　碎棉花以及小釘，米塊，硬紙等做各種實用品填玩具。</p>
<p>勞動隊是幼幼院院生生活的最大特　，伙食　，胸。全部套着白團單，上面橫排三個紅字「伙食隊一·還有一個阿拉伯字號碼、　煤、濾永、燒榮、煮飯、都是小朋友自己來，只有二個王役做指導。「淸潔隊」，每天早晨，飯後·及下午散了課，果合聽候分配工作，再散門去執行自己的淸潔任務，院長也奔上跑下·查勘及紀錄成績·保持全院的　潔與充滿朝氣的容貌。還有，由二十幾個女孩子組成「縫級隊」、她們不　為全院縫補破衣，而且在院裏添製新衣的時候，也能擔任下來，過去全院小朋友每人一身工裝，以及參加麗華大戲院表演時所需的海軍裝，都出自她們的小手！</p>

<h3>一個賬房的自述</h3>
<p>— 晨夢</p>
<p>我是一個舊式工廠的司販者（眼房），在旁　者聽得賬房的名詞、戒許都認為該職位是相當的美滿吧，此確非局內人所能明悉的，實在司賬之待遇，與敎師有同樣的淸寒。</p>
<p>物價是不斷地高漲着，但我們的薪資，是始終雖　增加的、雖經店主偶然良心發現酌量附加，但其所增之數　　有限。備此百物高貴之際，此區區　月二百元的薪資，作何　用呢？休請仰事俯蓄，且連個人的生活，亦成問題。按月除規定的薪資外，別無意外收入，共職務之繁忙，幾有一兼三戰之多。上至經理，下至學徒的工作·皆需我獨人前去應付，終日不允有一刻的空暇，責任之重大，是可想而知了。一切　錢的收支，皆從我手中進出·有時因工作過忙　漏記付款，或因不愼誤有短少款項等事發現。當時除自己忍痛賠償外·別無他法。數日微少、尙能賠負·若缺額過鉅，則不堪設想。無論如何的謹愼，做司賬的人，此　賠償的事，是難免的。此眞諺語所謂：一吞酸氣冷飯吃。」</p>
<p>感於紅藍色五元十元乃至於百元的備幣券，終日從我手中輸流地的進出着，但想到一家四口的粉食，眞有朝不保夕之憂愁、所以我只有終日　鈔　嘆。</p>
<p>對於我的日常生活，已而約　無可再節的地步。既不吸烟，又不　酒，數年來更無踏進娛樂塲一步·終日很少出外·偶然有之·亦以安　當車為宗旨，大小宴會，絕不有所預開，雖常經現友之邀、　總以藉口工作繁忙，甲婉言而謝絕之。啦年來始終未製一衣。所穿的皆係破舊不堪的、補有破洞的老布長衫，所以廠中的大小學徒　，表面上皆很親熱地叫我一聲賬房先生，　在背後·則皆改叫我為霉先生。的確我自己亦承認是大　霉了、試問此是司賬者所過的生活嗎？或　苦於淸寒的教師吧！</p>

<h3>（第二號轉來）　在防空洞中</h3>
<p>夜半十二點鐘的時候，又聽到在克拉　有砲聲。在雨中砲聲雖然相　稀少，但却非常有力，這是我們的水雷戰隊和敵方艦隊的大遭遇戰。在〇〇地作戰的我們水雷戰隊〇〇艘艦進入了克拉灣正是部隊向克倫班卡拉島東方　撤退的時候。敵艦影在黑暗的海面上漂浮着。敵方是巡洋艦驅逐艦等十數艘組成的有方艦隊。我方向敵軍艦隊猛烈地展開最拿手的魚雷戰。　人像雨點　地射來。另一部隊　聽到砲聲而從布拉　益海峽反轉來的辰光，敵人業已被擊退了。作戰完結的我方部隊，也早已返　沉乙級巡洋艦二艘，特務艦一艘。</p>
<p>雨落到六號早晨，仍然未停止。　林地窖的空，而不堪一用了。布的　鞋滿含着水分。火柴和查烟全都濕透，不能　火吸烟了。敵　老是在上空盤旋着，沿着道路，亂投炸彈，把這個叢林地帶炸得像棋盤孔一樣。偵察機在叢林地帶低低地　着，　梢被飛機引擎煽動的風煽動着，在搖擺不定着。牠是在　索我們的砲台陣地。兵士們　　出來擊落牠的這種衝動，被隊長抑制下去，只能摩拳擦掌，瞪視着而已。這眞是一種忍苦戰、在這一天，我們曾到防空洞去躱了三十五次警報。</p>
<h3>順風漂流的敵艦殘骸</h3>
<p>下午〇點，〇〇地的砲台　始砲轟了。這是對於在　斯灣登陸的敵軍　作的攻擊。我們在這樣殷殷的砲聲當中越渡到克倫班卡拉島。在舟　　運來四號夜戰負傷的　名勇士。這　舟艇，是昨夜被敵人拋　，而　我隊搶來的有　舟艇。雨停了，天空上閃爍作光的小星星也妞妮作　地出現了，　拉　眞有風平浪靜之感。在海面上流着重油，翻轉的小船　木材也在漂浮着。這是四號和五號敵艦因海戰而沉入克拉灣海底的殘骸。在克倫班卡拉　海岸的椰子林中，駐屯着增援拜　克的部隊。在這一天夜裏，我們住在最近海岸的〇〇部隊裏。</p>
<p>七號是晴得很好的天。我們在載重汽車裏顚簸着，被送到陸戰隊營去。這樣好的睛天，一直繼續到我們離開克倫班卡拉島的九號別一天。但在該處受敵　的轟炸程度，也非常劇烈。敵人的轟炸　厲害，而我們的地上砲火之　　，也隨着酷烈起來。我們　　炸機也不分晝夜　　炸敵人登陸的倫特巴島及賴　灣。我們的戰鬥機追擊着來襲的敵國戰鬥　，由克拉灣至克倫班卡拉的上空，　開丁壯烈無比的戰爭。担任夜間警戒的我們水上偵察機，曾非常勇敢。在七號深夜裏，只一架飛機竟大　地攻擊敵方　倫特巴方　企圖進入克拉灣的巡洋艦，驅逐艦等十數艘之大艦隊，竟使敵人掉轉頭來向囘走。這也許是敵人想囘去再在量上加以補充。</p>
<h3>敵機投下食糧</h3>
<p>蒙　和倫　巴方面殷殷砲聲，每天都可以聽得見。尤其是八號夜至九號　明的期間所進行的砲戰，更為壯烈。這　我在海洋的舟艇上看到的。在我們的　上飛過去的敵機，一直奔向蒙　方面。不大的工夫，彷彿在蒙達的上空高高地　　一個大的照明彈，趁着這個光亮就開始放砲了。這是倫特巴島上面的敵人所放的砲。</p>
<p>是九號上午〇時左右的事。聽着在拜羅克方　　了一陣如炒　的槍聲，這是我們的增援部隊和賴斯灣登陸的敵兵之遭遇　。聽　這是從八號黎明　就開始了的戰爭。下午二時，瞭望員　敵機在賴　灣投下很多的小型降落傘，降落傘分靑紅二色。〇　副官說　「這是投食糧的」。在這天晚上，我們乘　〇驅逐　便離開克倫班島了。（漢譯自十月四日朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>從職工舞弊　談到人事管理</h3>
<p>— 半頁</p>
<p>近來在報紙上常看到，耳朶裏也常聽到，關於職工舞弊潛逃的消息，事件發生後　輿論上常有幾種不同的見解：有的認爲職工舞弊，實是不知法律爲何物，惟有　捕緝拿，交官法辦，非如此，不足以整法紀，儆奸　　有的認爲目前職工待遇實太低微，不堪生活浪潮的打擊、舞弊勾當，實由環境促成，責任還在資方本身的反省，還有一種是站在社會立塲第三者的說話，他們認爲職工生活不能安定。固是造成舞弊之原因，然而事實上，職工捲逃鉅欵，却很少預儲着大量米糧和柴炭，十九却是投機失敗，睹博虧負，及其他惡劣的環境引誘墮落，因此他們把責任交給社會了：</p>
<p>持平而論，各方面的理由都對，一件事故的發生，往往是綜合各方面的因子而成，現在我們爲要防制此種事件的繼續蔓延，除了社會上的責任、應由社會當局注意消滅外·我認爲還是着重在各組織自身的人事管理，而下列幾點，尤是當務之急。而應當設法加以改進：</p>
<p>待遇之改善：近年來生活費用之急遽上漲，眞可駭人。根據統計，事變後至民國二十七年五月，所漲尙屬有限，至民國二十八年五月還不及六成，及至去年五月巳升至十七倍半弱，而在今年五月，却巳漲到四十八倍强了，依照工資理論，工資是應當決定於最低生活費用的即貨幣工資，應與實際生活費用成　比例。今年七月，新聞報館有工資問題座談的召集，據蔡止雅先生的報吿，職員五口之家·生活必須品，至少有六十二種，依照今年七月份的物價，職工薪津數目，每月至少應得三千零七十元，方可維持其最低生活，試問目前各組織中職員，能達到此最低生活標準之工資有幾？而且物價還在不時變動，八九兩月份戶口米配給量，又見短少，職工生活不能安定，身雖在辦公室內，而心仍　懸於柴米油鹽，如是工作效能，固不必談，而狡黠者伺機乘便，不良之動機，由是而起矣！故爲求行政收效，事業發展，弊　防制。職工生活安定，實爲先決問題。</p>
<p>休閒生活之指導：休閒生活原是人生活動中之一部，職工整日工作，精神自不勉疲勞，爲保持職工之身心健康，工作之餘，應當給予正常之休閒活動，如球類棋類競賽，音樂劇表演，皆可提倡，規模較大的組織，可獨自舉辦，較小的亦可聯合舉行，經費應由各組織列爲正當開支，這許多活動，既足以陶冶心靈，聯絡情感，無形中　會養成了合作，公正及守秩序愛團體的美德　職工對於最低生活，既可維持，公　又有正常活動，足供消遣·則一切曲　邪想，自可消滅，而專心致志於本身事業之推進，俗有「閒則生非」之語，提倡正常活動，以代替一般之打牌，跑狗·跳、也是人事問題中，不可忽略的。</p>
<p>感之聯絡：我很感到今日許多組織中，上下之間，太嫌隔膜，可以說只有命令之應對，很少情感之融和，有很多已服務多年之職員，經理還不知其姓甚名誰、接觸的機會旣少，於是相互間，自易行起猜忌·嫌隙·誤會·而得不到同情和諒解，同時在上者對屬下既是漠不關懷·若過客·而在下者亦視上峯爲路人，不易捧出忠誠的心來服務了！易經所謂「以旅與下，其義喪也」就是這個意思！這實在是今日各組織中一般的通病，我以爲一組織各階層問，應常有個別談話，或團體談話的機會，家庭狀况，個人志趣，及對事業本身之意見，皆可漫談·有問題爲之解決，有意見，不妨採納，由談話的接觸，既可得到情意的投洽，而在上者亦可從這裏，觀其所由，察其所安，也是一個很好的升遷調派的參考。</p>
<p>考察須嚴密：有人對於用人的　度，認爲用則不穎，疑則不用。的確有許多訑方，從屬人員，因不得其主之深信，做事往往有許多　碍和掣肘的地方，這在下級做事的人，是很感煩惱的。但我認爲信任則可　過分的信用，很容易變成放任，一經放任·　外禍忠，也就往往隨之而來，在歷史上，在社會上，我們常看到關於禍起蕭牆，變生肘腑的事，這也就是信任太深疏於防範的緣故，所以一組織內，公　相處，不妨如家人骨肉，職務份內，則應力求公正嚴明，尤其要注意到奉公守法者，應使安於其位，脅肩謟笑之徒，勿爲所惑，所謂恩威並施，賞罰嚴明，用人之道，不過如是耳。</p>
<p>養成儉樸風氣：事　以來上海以情形特殊，給商人造了許多機會，生活之享受，舉止之豪闊，眞是不可一世，於是在社會上形成一種極度虛榮浮華的風氣，日本經濟專家吉田政治在「考察中國物價問題」一文中，曾說到在國際飯店招宴時，上海人民瘋狂享受，揮金如土的情形，我不知道這是　評，還是諷語，在戰時人民的生活，是不是應當瘋狂的享受呢？而這裏面的角色，我想恐怕大部份是官塲　塲中人吧！戰爭仍在進行，物資日見短　·節約運動是戰爭國家中普遍的運動，國府也正在極力提倡宣傳，今日官塲商塲中人，似應加以猛省悔悟，我也曾看到一年齡還不足二十的練習生，西裝筆挺，抽着板烟辦公的神氣現像，雖然服裝嗜好，各有自由，然而風氣所播，大家爲表示地位，不得不　事增華，於是薪資所得，費於衣服飾物猶不足，乃不得不另動腦筋矣。所以每一組織，對於職工日常生活行動，尤其在此戰時，應參照新國民運動及節約規約，努力推行，此不僅是有助於國策之堆行，對於一組織之本身風氣，是很有關係的：</p>
<p>鼓勵學術技術之硏究：一切事樂的進展，是靠着不斷的努力與改進，但我們看到很多商業組識中，一切設施，十年前是這樣，現在這是如此，　規曹隨，似乎是改動不得，這保守性就是中國人的特長吧，其實還不是懶在作祟·硏究精神，是當前各組絹最疏忽的一點，根本有錢堆貨，即可賺錢·談什麽成人會計，人事管理，其實好景不會長久，事變境遷，　何以生存於競爭市塲。記得朱執信先生曾這樣說過：一從事職　的人不讀書，表示他對此聯業還不忠實。」但我們在報紙上却常看到練習生學徒因爲偷閒讀書，而常遭遇到可怕的無情的打擊，眞令人憤恨，我認爲這是應當由輿論界來喚醒他們注意的、練習生學徒在工　應由公費囑令讀書補習，以救經騐之不足，而對於職員，更應鼓勵硏究　表，使他對於從事職業的寶貴經騐，或一得　長，再傳　給別人，或對某一問題有所困難作公開之硏时，因此一個較大的組織，應有圖書館及出版物的設立，在目前　價紙價，非常昻貴，物力或有困難，但現在各業都有公會的組織，此事亦不妨由公會來辦理，刊物內容，可包括通告，啟事，法令彚編，消息傳達，這樣也可免得許多公函傳遞的耗費和忙繁，而關於某種問題之硏討，相互參觀報吿，個人生活，文藝抒寫，及其他有趣小品文字，都可列入，事關本身，往往會感到特別興趣，願意親近，由此可謀各　業問或各同人間感情之聯絡，知識之介紹，消息之傳遞，眞是一件極有價値的舉動，職工因有圖書館及出版物的設立，精神可有寄託，也可免得心神外驚　滅少了許多無開的酬應和消耗。人事問題，千頭萬緖，以上所言，不過舉其一端而已。</p>
<h3>如何調整煤球供給</h3>
<p>勵行限價　改善煤質</p>
<p>近來本市煤球恐慌，幾遍全市·各煤廠為格於當局之限價，不得不以物質原料之變更，例如額外佣金出貨等費之增加、巧立名目·而其煤實之劣、無異石子，既無火力·又易過度</p>
<p>此種局面，無非限　當局之外强內弛，現在黑市將成官價，煤質竟如石子，誰人負責，事實方　，徒增民間痛苦，燃料問題之解決，亟待設法補求，煤質方面之改善，願望各大煤商略存一分公德之心，此全市民衆，無量企幸者也。（建淸）</p>
<p>配給煤屑　自製煤球</p>
<p>日前報載「居民每日不可或缺之必需燃料·煤球·現貨供應邇日會趨缺乏、各另售店多不照價普遍發售，以致一般居民深感不便，長此以往·攸關民生安定，至鉅　大，因之當局擬採行計　配給制度，以應正當需要，」云云，於此足　當局關懷民生，小民用宜感激</p>
<p>惟以區區之意、以爲煤球本質原爲無姻煤屑，和以少許泥土，使之凝成法，毋須煤球廠者加以製造之必要，　一經廠方製造，每噸約須加製造費二百元，在居民增加負担，在廠方則尙須虧本，故近來尙有漲價之謠傳，按之原料—無烟煤屑，自配給迄今。其價格始終約為三百元左右，此因當局顧念民生，不忍有所增加也，　煤球所以歷次漲價者，均為增加製造費用耳。設若當局逕以無烟煤屑配給居民，任居民自行人工製造，（其法　爲簡便，取煤屑加泥土十分之二，加水少許拌和之，分成小塊、以日光晒乾，或以火力烘乾，即可應用。）可省去居民之　大製造費用之負担，而當局更可因此將煤球廠用　製造大量煤球之重要物資—電力，烘煤機油，五金等，移作其他更　要之用途，固甚合　目今所提倡之節約運動</p>
<p>抑猶有進者，煤球廠商藉口虧本，將煤球粗製　造，其質地半爲泥土煤屎，半為無烟煤屑，故火力低微，耗費量大，居民無不怨聲載道，亟盼當局加以改善者　然煤球廠商不特無改善之意，且時藉口機器損壞。力　减少出品　造成燃料恐慌之局面、以隨其漲價之目的。同時將原料煤屑供售黑市、（如九月八日新聞所載，）亦有大量囤積，待價而沽者，此輩祇圖一巳私慾，罔顧當局苦心，羣衆利益之惡劣行爲，殊堪痛恨，如當局能將無烟煤屑，還行配給居民，則不特能减輕居民負担，節約重要物資，抑且因此可以敉平黑市之一部，永絕燃料之恐慌，誠為一舉而　善者也。</p>
<p>或曰居民自行人工製造煤球，殊感麻煩，然　　目今之煤球，品質窳劣，缺乏黏性，不久自碎（甚有居民故意擊碎，因碎易於燃燒，）類皆重行製造，此則與逕以煤屑自行製造，無何區別，且煤屑隨處可放，無如煤球必須收藏屋內，不使潮濕之不便。居民可隨時取作品質優良之燃料，以其製法簡易，久而生巧，敢信居民，必不以爲麻煩，或轉以便利也。</p>
<p>然即煤球廠商，及另　店舖，勢將因之停業，雖云局部問題，究非安定民生之法爲當局宜規定合法利潤，是項煤屑。仍中其供給、以維其營業，庶幾有百利而無一害。</p>
<p>十月十二日，石炭　合會大橋事務局長在報上有謂：一—處此決戰下　決不容浪費物資，此固理所當然。尤其如煤斤爲決戰下最重要之物資，必須節約消費，—對不緊要者，能有代用品者，以及有節約餘地之部份，決定加以調整消費。」誠如上述，則煤球廠之製造煤球，跡近奢華，大可任居民自行人工製造以代之，或亦爲有利國計民生之一端，希當局加以硏討，社會加以鼓勵之。（曙光）</p>

        <h1>1943.10.19</h1>
<h3>Editorial: Advocating National Salvation Through Science</h3>
<p>Modern industry originated after the Meiji Restoration in Japan, around the same time that Zuo Zongtang and Li Hongzhang advocated for modern industry in our country. In terms of resources, Japan at that time was far inferior to China. In terms of intelligence and skill, the Chinese were initially no less capable than the Japanese. However, one nation made rapid progress, quickly joining the ranks of industrialized nations, while the other remained infantile, still in its early stages. What was the reason for this?</p>
<p>There are four reasons why Chinese industry has failed to develop. First, the Chinese people regard their own culture as very high and are unwilling to humbly accept foreign cultures. As a result, although enlightened individuals diligently promote progress from above, the shortsighted criticize it from below, leading to policies being implemented only while the advocate lives, and abandoned after they die. For example, the Gansu Woolen Mill was painstakingly managed by Zuo Zongtang and seen as the pioneer of China's wool spinning industry. However, it was shut down soon after Zuo left office. Similar cases are too numerous to list. Second, the scholar-official class clings to the mentality of "transforming barbarians with Chinese culture" and considers it shameful to discuss foreign affairs and new learning. For example, Wo Ren, when ordered to head the Tongwen Guan (School of Combined Learning), although not daring to openly defy the imperial decree, intentionally fell off his horse and injured his foot when taking office, feigning illness to resign. The so-called "pure stream" (moralistic officials) at the time unanimously praised him for not abandoning his principles. Third, political corruption is rampant, the law offers no protection, and corrupt officials, local bullies, and evil gentry collude to treat new enterprises as objects of exploitation, causing those not yet established to be stifled in their infancy and those already established to be cut short in their early stages. Fourth, scientific research is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Domestic schools lack adequate facilities, and graduates find it difficult to find employment. As a result, the number of people studying natural sciences is decreasing daily, while the number studying social sciences is increasing. The lack of both enterprises and talent is mutually reinforcing. Due to these factors, the development of Chinese industry has lagged behind by decades.</p>
<p>Since the late Qing Dynasty, social ideology has changed, and the first two reasons no longer exist. However, the lack of legal protection and the underdevelopment of science education have not yet been fundamentally changed. Therefore, investors still view enterprises as a long shot, and those who genuinely want to run enterprises lament the difficulty of finding talent. To correct this, it is necessary for politics to get on the right track as soon as possible, and cultivating talent is the most urgent task. Cultivating talent is certainly not a matter of a day or two, but precisely because of this, we must start as soon as possible. Japan's science education is a hundred times more developed than our country's, and it has cultivated no less than tens of thousands of technical personnel at all levels. However, its cabinet recently passed educational policies that still seek to reorganize the system from primary schools to universities, increasing the number of students in science and engineering. Observing them and observing ourselves, our country, from the government to the people, should better understand the direction we should take in running education in the future.</p>
<p>In the past, among the universities in Shanghai that were famous for their mechanical engineering departments and had the most complete equipment were Tongji University and Jiaotong University. Their graduates have made outstanding contributions in the domestic engineering field. Since the incident, the former has moved to the interior, and the latter, due to the school buildings and equipment, no longer has opportunities for students to conduct experiments. Among the other universities in Shanghai that have science and engineering departments, only Datong and St. John's Universities exist. Judging by the future needs of the country and the number of people that each school can currently train, the difference is too great.</p>
<p>Since cultivating technical talent is currently an urgent task, expanding the enrollment of science and engineering departments in universities and strengthening the basic science and engineering courses in middle schools are both urgent measures. Here, we propose the following for the government and society to pay attention to:</p>
<p>The government should issue a clear decree stipulating the ratio of science and engineering enrollment to other departments in universities and provide financial subsidies to expand experimental equipment and negotiate the return of the Jiaotong University campus.</p>
<p>The government should order the educational authorities in each province and city to strictly supervise the courses taught in middle schools, especially those related to the foundations of science and engineering.</p>
<p>Public-spirited educators should advocate for establishing more science and engineering lectures and providing excellent teachers to supplement the insufficient strength of schools.</p>
<p>The public should value the future needs of the country and send their children to study natural sciences.</p>
<p>The publishing industry should translate and compile a large number of science books and provide them to students at low prices.

<h3>### Organize a National Envoy Delegation to Question Japan</h3>
<p>The Chinese National Foreign Affairs Promotion Association held a board meeting yesterday. One of the motions was to organize a national envoy delegation to visit friendly Japan. At the same time, Minister Chu gave an explanation on the spot regarding the significance and reasons for organizing the delegation. We have long advocated for organizing an envoy delegation to visit friendly Japan from a non-governmental standpoint.</p>
<p>In July of this year, the economic community of friendly Japan organized an economic envoy delegation to visit China, exchanging opinions with official and non-governmental economic figures in our country, which has been helpful to economic cooperation between the two countries. In order to further strengthen ties, we should also organize an envoy delegation to reciprocate the visit to Japan. Therefore, it is a very timely move for the National Foreign Affairs Promotion Association to initiate the organization of an envoy delegation to visit.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War and the National Government's declaration of war on Britain and the United States, the relationship between China and Japan should objectively be one of shared weal and woe, of being closely related. However, upon calm observation, it seems that words of goodwill and cooperation still exceed the facts of goodwill and cooperation. Goodwill and cooperation between the two governments are certainly important, but the sincere mutual engagement of the people of the two countries is equally important. National diplomacy aims to promote the sincere mutual engagement of the people of the two countries, and the visit of a national envoy delegation is one aspect of practicing national diplomacy. Therefore, the mission of the national envoy delegation is to communicate the opinions of the people of the two countries and promote sincere cooperation.</p>
<p>In view of the needs of the aforementioned objective environment, we earnestly hope that the national envoy delegation will be established as soon as possible and visit as early as possible. Before its organization, it should fully prepare the procedures for the visit, first discussing how to benefit the cooperation between the people of the two countries? How to communicate the opinions of the people of the two countries? How to resolve the estrangement between the people of the two countries? And how to learn from their strengths to compensate for our weaknesses? Problems should be put forward practically and made into an outline as a basis for the visit. It is firmly believed that friendly Japan's government and people are eagerly awaiting the sincere cooperation between the two countries and will certainly give enthusiastic guidance and discuss in good faith to answer our questions regarding the visit of our national envoy delegation. Here, we take the lead in providing several matters as topics for the envoy delegation's visit.</p>
<p>Economic affairs are most directly related to the people, therefore, economic cooperation is the precursor to all cooperation, and also the precursor to connecting emotions and communicating opinions between the people of the two countries. How to eliminate obstacles and strengthen economic cooperation? This should be studied first.</p>
<p>Culture is an expression of a country's character and uniqueness, cultural exchanges are very helpful in the mutual understanding and understanding between the people of the two countries, and the effect is significant, so special attention should also be paid to it.</p>
<p>Japan's domestic politics, economy, society, education, culture, etc., all dynamics are in the process of preparing for a decisive battle, and they are all worth our borrowing and reference. During the visit, we must humbly explore, observe the key points, and record them in detail. After returning to the country, we will contribute to the implementation of the authorities and complete the wartime system.</p>

<p>Ulla's Remarks</p>
<p>Jakarta, 18th, Central News Agency Dispatch: The newly appointed Vice Chairman of the Java Central Senate, Ulla (approximately 65 years old), was a member of the former National Senate and served as its Vice Chairman. He is the oldest member of the current Senate. Ulla made a statement on the 17th, describing the similarities and differences between the old and new Senates, saying: "The spirit of the former National Senate, which was based on democracy, and the current Central Senate, which is based on a shared ideal, is vastly different. For example, the oath-taking form of the former National Senate was that each senator took an oath to the Governor-General separately. Now, the oldest of the senators takes an oath on behalf of all the senators to the Supreme Commander. This is an expression of the solidarity and unity of all members of the Central Senate, who pledge to cooperate with the military administration, and is completely different from the individualism of democracy. Moreover, the various factions of the old Senate were hostile to each other. The members of the current Central Senate are all loving and supportive of each other, full of the spirit of unity. This is certainly not what existed in the old Dutch East Indies era. Also, regarding the selection of the Chairman, in the old Dutch East Indies era, it was appointed by the King of the Netherlands, but now it is elected by the senators. This is extremely gratifying. Because I have a deep feeling for this, I am willing to use this remaining body to fully cooperate with the development of the military administration."</p>

<p>Hanoi, 18th, Central News Agency Dispatch: The US Air Force stationed in Chongqing has repeatedly intruded into Vietnam and blindly bombed the Haiphong area, causing great harm to the Vietnamese people. This behavior is extremely despicable because they fear the counterattack of the Japanese air defense forces and dare not fly close to military facilities, instead, they specifically bomb non-military facilities. For example, the bombing of Zhongzhai Street on the 8th of this month, the bombing of the French store street and the French children's elementary school in the residential street on the 10th, destroying the school building and the Peace Memorial Tower in the nearby square, are all inhumane acts. On the morning of the 16th and 17th, they came again and dropped many bombs on the Jiatai Street in Haiphong, causing the Vietnamese residents to be extremely angry. The local authorities have decided to move the municipal co-educational middle school in Haiphong to Hanoi, and the elementary schools are also being evacuated to other landlords to prevent bombing. The schools began to move on the 17th.</p>

<h3>Celebrating Philippine Independence, Bose's Speech</h3>
<p>Shonan, 18th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Indian Independence League held a celebration for Philippine independence at Harrer Public Garden here on the evening of the 17th. Many Indian nationals attended, and the atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic. During the gathering, the League's supreme commander, Subhas Chandra Bose, delivered a speech. In addition to congratulating the Philippines on its independence, he also urged Indian nationals to strive for the glorious independence of India. The gist of his speech is as follows: The Philippines has now achieved its long-held aspirations and become independent. The Indian Independence League is holding this celebration to offer our congratulations. When we celebrated the independence of Burma last time, we did not expect that the Philippines would achieve independence in such a short period. This is truly a "pleasant surprise" for us Indians. Therefore, while offering congratulations on the independence of the Philippines, all of you present should continue to fight for the freedom and independence of our motherland and to defeat our enemies. You must know that the opportunity for independence is extremely rare. If we miss the opportunity today, we will regret it for eternity. Therefore, the independence of the motherland and the pursuit of freedom should be realized as soon as possible. The enemy is no longer able to defend India alone. Currently, there are American, Yu, and non-military forces stationed in India. However, our permanent independence and freedom cannot be obtained solely through the assistance of allied nations. Therefore, we must sacrifice everything to fight and exchange blood for light. Now, the Indian National Army is marching towards the motherland, and the time for India's restoration is approaching. At that time, we will demonstrate our bravery and strength and drive the British out of our motherland. At the same time, when we launch our offensive, the Indian army will become our comrades, providing us with internal support. Today, I dare to say that if Indian nationals residing in Asia can unite and each fulfill their duties, we will surely achieve independence.</p>

Soviet forces, along the line from Krivoy Rog to the Sea of Azov, continued their attempts to break through German lines, but did not achieve significant victories. The points that were broken through were quickly filled by German forces, and German forces launched counterattacks, repelling the enemy. Since the German withdrawal from Zaporozhye, the center of the fighting has shifted to Dnipropetrovsk to the northwest. Soviet forces are currently concentrating fresh troops in Dnipro, including 15 infantry divisions, 250 tanks, 200 artillery pieces, and a large number of fighter planes, launching an offensive from the bridgehead. Although Soviet forces have a numerical advantage, they were ultimately repelled by German artillery fire. The Soviet commander was forced to order a retreat to the rear for redeployment due to losses in that area alone. The German forces also paid a considerable price in this victory.</p>
<p>German Defensive Battles Continue to Achieve Victory</p>
<p>Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency dispatch) – A German News Agency report: In the central Dnieper River region, Soviet forces, with powerful tanks and infantry units, attempted to expand their bridgehead at the Dnieper River bend near Beryslav, but were blocked by German forces, suffering heavy losses. The Soviet tank formations, followed by infantry, advanced under intense rapid artillery fire. At that time, German forces urgently deployed heavy artillery to the front lines, launching fierce attacks on the enemy flanks and cutting them off. Within half an hour, 18 Soviet tanks were ablaze and unable to move. Soviet infantry attempted to hide behind the remaining tanks, but failed and were annihilated by German direct-fire artillery units. By noon, 38 enemy tanks were unable to move, and the infantry, with the exception of small, insignificant groups, was also annihilated. Thus, the enemy's offensive came to a halt. Northwest of Kyiv, Soviet forces, with powerful infantry and tank units, attempted to penetrate the German rear lines within the city. At that time, extremely fierce fighting broke out in the depressions of the rugged forest area. The enemy's offensive made some temporary progress, but was soon blocked by reserve troops. These reserve troops immediately launched a counterattack and recovered the crossroads that had previously fallen into Soviet hands. At the mouth of the Prypiat River, Soviet forces, in order to recover the territory they had lost in recent days, attempted to penetrate German lines simultaneously at various points with several powerful units, including tanks and motorized detachments. One of these units was encircled by a clever German flanking maneuver and annihilated. At the same time, another enemy detachment was repelled to its original positions and forced to abandon all of its equipment and heavy weaponry.</p>
<p>Detachment Operations Particularly Successful</p>
<p>Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The German High Command announced in a communiqué at noon on Sunday that the withdrawal of German forces from the Zaporozhye bridgehead reported on October 15 was carried out according to the original plan in a large-scale detachment operation on the Eastern Front. The leaders of the detachment units and the troops themselves achieved particular success in carrying out this operation. All weapons, equipment, supplies, and tools were transported across the Dnieper River bridges under the threat of enemy air and land forces. German engineers made special contributions to the destruction of important military facilities, the execution of river crossings, and the timely demolition of embankments and bridges. The fierce Soviet offensives on both sides of Mariupol were repelled, and the enemy task force was annihilated in the counterattack. Our forces captured 648 prisoners of war and seized 50 artillery pieces. Southeast of Kryvyi Rih, Soviet forces continued their attempts to break through with powerful forces yesterday (October 16).

<h3>German Forces in Italy Employing Clever Defensive Tactics to Halt Allied Advance</h3>
<p>Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency dispatch) – A German News Agency report: Allied forces fiercely attacked German positions in the Volturno and Apennine Mountains regions on the 14th. In this battle, Allied forces suffered heavy damage, and the US Fifth Army under General Clark retreated towards the coastal area. A combined US tank and infantry unit also launched an offensive west of Volturno. Although the forces were quite strong, they were unable to break through the first line of German defenses, and the attempt to advance northward ultimately failed. Furthermore, Allied reinforcements, possessing 50 tanks, landed north of Volturno on the 15th, but failed to approach German positions. German forces have withdrawn from some positions in the Capua area and moved to the high ground north of Volturno, and are halting the Allied advance everywhere with excellent defensive operations. The fighting between the two sides is gradually becoming intense. At the same time, along the road from Caserta through the Apennine Mountains to Rome, Allied forces have continuously concentrated powerful infantry and tank units over the past two or three days. The British and Canadian forces in the Campobasso area suddenly launched an offensive against German mountain positions on the 16th. In order to avoid being surrounded by Allied forces, German forces destroyed all military facilities and withdrew to rear positions. German forces in the Venafro area also withdrew due to Allied interference. The Allied forces currently have a tendency to advance slowly northward along the road. However, because the German forces cut off the advance routes, their progress was blocked. In addition, the German artillery units launched fierce bombardments, further throwing the enemy forces into a state of confusion.</p>
<p>Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency dispatch) – A German headquarters announced on the 16th that two strong German units defending the Campania Plain on the Southern Italian front had repelled the British and American forces that were attacking with numerically superior forces.

<h3>The Arduous Solomon Islands Campaign: Bombarding the Enemy in a Rain of Fire</h3>
<p>American forces, having landed on Rendova Island, further invaded New Georgia Island, engaging in relentless and brutal battles with the Imperial Army, leaving behind piles of corpses and rivers of blood. Two days before the enemy landed on Rendova Island, on June 28th, this reporter arrived at New Georgia Island, passing through Munda and Bairoko amidst a hail of bullets, reaching Kolombangara Island, and deeply experienced the various profound aspects of war. What follows is what I continued to write under the smoke and fire of battle.</p>
<p>Annoying Pitfalls Along the Way</p>
<p>We arrived at Munda at 3:00 AM on June 28th, two days before the enemy landed on Rendova Island, during a rainy period. The bottom of the boat suddenly screeched as it was caught on a reef. Jumping ashore from the bow, I felt the cold morning air assaulting my skin. The Solomon Islands are now in winter, with a climate similar to autumn in Japan. The road was riddled with large pitfalls, some ten to twenty feet in diameter, which were truly annoying. These were the remnants of indiscriminate bombings by enemy bombers, day and night.</p>
<p>Climbing through the jungle, we reached the 〇〇 Marine Corps camp. It was a continuous and rugged path, a mixture of red mud and coral reefs. The daily meals were just bland soup, but this morning, we were given a little extra oversized cabbage. At 〇:00 AM, we heard a rumbling sound in the southeast. Moments later, a group of 〇〇 aircraft appeared over the jungle. They turned out to be our own aircraft. They were probably heading to attack enemy bases on Guadalcanal or Tulagi Island. The soldiers all ran out of the camp, offering cheers.</p>
<p>At around 3:00 PM, another rumbling sound arose from the northwest. The sound gradually approached. It was a large formation of over fifty enemy aircraft. Behind 〇〇, they suddenly split into two groups, preparing to bomb. The shoreline became a complete hell of smoke and earth. A strong, dry wind whipped against us. As the enemy was being shot down at 〇:00 PM within fifteen minutes, a radio report came in, announcing "A large enemy fleet is heading north." When I ran to the telephone room in the cave, the commander was already sitting on a folding chair. Seeing the reporter's silhouette, he smiled and said, "You've finally arrived." From the 〇〇 observation post, a report stated that the enemy fleet was entering Rendova. The enemy fleet consisted of five destroyers, six transport ships, and a dozen or so torpedo boats and high-speed boats. They were unloading landing craft from the transport ships. The enemy was starting to land. Fully armed soldiers were biting into dry bread and drinking water from thermos flasks. The soldiers seemed excited. However, they were not flustered at all. A sense of boundless tenacity surged from their hearts. From the 〇〇 observation post, the island of Rendova, partially obscured by clouds, was very clear. Looking through binoculars, I immediately saw the enemy on landing craft, continuing to land at full speed. Unnoticed, six Douglas aircraft hovered above them, and the number gradually increased. Not long after, a burst of smoke suddenly erupted from the 〇〇 side, followed by a devastating bombardment of the fortress positions buried on 〇〇 Island. Enemy destroyers sailed towards Cape Munda. Enemy bullets smacked against the coastline, stirring up thick dust. At 〇:00 PM, the sound of our fighter planes soaring in the sky came from the east, and the sound of machine guns firing could be clearly heard. The approaching aircraft were engaged in a magnificent aerial battle. "An enemy fighter plane has been shot down, and the pilot has parachuted out," "Two Curtiss fighter planes have been shot down, one of which disintegrated in the air," the observers reported, which was enough to prove our absolute advantage. The enemy fleet set up a smokescreen and began to retreat. Abandoned landing craft were moving back and forth on Rendova. In an instant, a loud roar rose in the sky again, hovering over Rendova Harbor. The enemy was flexing its muscles and showing off its strength with its numerical superiority, which was truly hateful. At 〇:00 PM, the enemy fleet began to flee again, because our planes had returned.</p>
<p>The reporter hurriedly ran to the observers' side to see. In the sky near Rendova Island, our planes were freely performing aerial combat in the clouds. One against two, or one against four, our fighter planes, despite being outnumbered, still bravely spurted out dark smoke, and in that instant, white parachutes opened, slowly falling to the ground. Enemy planes were shot down one by one. The observers were shouting: "Two enemy destroyers hit!", "One transport ship is on fire!". The enemy fleet hid in the shadows of the islands, and in the blink of an eye, a hazy black smoke spread everywhere. Our aircraft formation returned in triumph. The sound of the enemy could no longer be heard. A temporary silence after the fierce battle finally descended, but it did not last for ten minutes.</p>
<p>The Enemy Ships' Tenacious Assault</p>
<p>The sound of new aircraft rose from behind 〇〇 Mountain. Thirty-seven enemy bombers rushed towards the defensive positions along the coast of Munda. After ten minutes of aerial combat, they were repelled. The enemy lost six aircraft, while we suffered no losses. At 3:00 PM, enemy bombers attacked again from the north, bombing the coastline. One enemy destroyer appeared on the sea south of Danan, and ten torpedo boats passed through the waters near Wanga U. These were all reported by the 〇〇 observation post. On this day, the number of enemy aircraft intruding on the adjacent area totaled 391, with intrusions occurring 35 to 40 times. Sixty were attack aircraft, and the rest were reconnaissance aircraft.</p>
<p>A Fleet Attempting to Land</p>
<p>July 1st was also a cloudy day with no sun. At 4:30 AM, an enemy fleet, covered by destroyers and fighter planes, appeared near Rendova Island. Observers reported that this time it appeared to be cargo ships. At 〇:00 PM, our planes took off, carrying out a fierce bombardment of Rendova Harbor, where the enemy was landing. A fierce and magnificent aerial battle was raging in the sky. Before long, as our aircraft formation returned to its original defense area, the enemy's high-speed boats began to falter. Perhaps they were rescuing downed airmen. At this time, a large number of enemy troops began landing like a rising tide. By nightfall, a part of their landing force had advanced to Ambanpa Island, in front of Munda. The sound of enemy reconnaissance planes still swirled in the sky. At midnight, the rumbling of cannons could be clearly heard on Rendova Island. This was the sound of our main destroyer〇ships beginning to bombard Rendova, resulting in the sinking and damaging of two torpedo boats.</p>
<p>July 2nd was an exceptionally clear day. Six enemy destroyers and four transport ships entered Tulagi Harbor again. At 7:00 AM, the enemy on Rendova began shelling Munda. This was because the cannons had already been placed in position. 〇〇 Staff 〇〇 Battery called, asking, "Are the enemy not using poison gas?" The enemy is very despicable and capable of anything. Today, army heavy bombers started aerial combat with enemy fighter planes. The bombers dived on Rendova Island. Enemy anti-aircraft guns had already been set up. Soon after, black smoke rose in Rendova Harbor. An observer said: "It looks like a gunpowder depot has caught fire."</p>
<p>At 8:00 PM, our 〇〇 battery all began to bombard. This was because a fleet of enemies attempting to land near Rubian Island, facing Munda, had been discovered. According to the 〇〇 observer's report, twenty-five landing craft were sunk, and enemy soldiers were scattered and floating on the sea. Our Marine Corps soldiers were wiping their gun barrels and sharpening their bayonets. Their common belief was to "avenge Guadalcanal." Five days have passed since I arrived in Munda, and three days since the enemy landed. During this time, I have seen the heroic struggles of the Imperial Army soldiers, and I don't know how many times it has made me secretly shed tears of admiration and gratitude.</p>
<p>Torrential Rain in the Jungle</p>
<p>One crack of thunder in the clear sky, and immediately black clouds gathered, followed by torrential rain. This kind of "Squall" rain in the South Seas doesn't seem to stop easily. The soldiers offered us canned goods and soda. But I firmly refused. I only put a small bag of dry bread on my back, borrowed Commander 〇〇's personal sword, and left the mountain with my companions, Mr. Ozawa (a reporter) and Mr. Fukushima, in the pouring rain. The sea route was dangerous, so we decided to take the jungle path, rarely used by people, to Bairoko.</p>
<p>Crossing the jungle was by no means an easy task. The torrential rain soaked through our clothes, and the clothes, heavy with rainwater, seemed to increase the weight a lot, causing pain in our shoulder bones as if they were breaking. The mud was knee-deep, and we often slipped and fell, sinking into the mud. Along the way, we came across reinforcements heading to 〇〇. Like us, water was flowing from their heavy clothing. Their leggings and leather shoes were covered in mud. We couldn't travel at night, so we only traveled 〇 kilometers each day, staying overnight in the 〇〇 unit of the army. The 3rd was clear, but the Southern unique rain "Squall" came down, and the 4th was also like that. During these two days, we crossed 〇〇 Mountain, crossed 〇〇 Valley, and broke through the muddy area of 〇〇 fruit, and reached the Marine Corps garrison in Bairoko at the wrong time on the 4th.</p>
<p>Enemy Tracer Bullets Overhead</p>
<p>Above Bairoko, as in Munda, the rumbling sound of enemy reconnaissance planes constantly circled in the sky. That night, we were guided by sailors from 〇〇 Headquarters, and hurriedly headed towards the coast in the darkness. At that moment, a heavy aircraft sound suddenly approached, seemingly from an enemy reconnaissance plane, so we left the road and hid in the woods. Then there was a burst of cannon fire. It was the enemy plane firing. We ran into the jungle. Suddenly, fire broke through the darkness, and with a thunderous sound, it seemed like the earth's axis had lost its balance. This was the cannon fire from our 〇〇 battery.</p>
<p>Soon after, enemy bullets were striking the coastline, stirring up a cruel sound. The sea could not be seen. The enemy's tracer bullets were weaving overhead like fire threads, chaotically piercing the darkness. The sound of cannon fire, sometimes weak, sometimes strong, continued one after another until 3:00 AM the next morning, the 5th. During that period, the torrential rain also stopped from time to time, so we were cold to our feet. Before long, the sky began to turn white, so we returned to 〇〇 Headquarters, crying like cattle. The soldiers were fully armed and ready, their eyes all fixed on the jungle. We were also preparing.</p>
<p>Enemy Transport Fleet Crushed</p>
<p>On the night of the 4th, an enemy fleet, covered by three cruisers and three destroyers, attempted to land near Bairoko, and entered Kula Gulf. Fortunately, at this time, one of our destroyers, passing through the northeastern sea off Kolombangara Island, had already seen these shadows clearly. The enemy fleet was sailing in the sea between Kolombangara Island and Bairoko. The cruisers were in the lead, followed by the destroyers, and the transport fleet was bringing up the rear. Suddenly, a fire flashed, and the enemy began to bombard Kolombangara. Our batteries, equipped on Kolombangara Island, also rose up to fight. Our destroyer, carrying a special mission, rushed into Kula Gulf, repeatedly firing torpedoes. The lookout on the lead ship saw two huge columns of water rising high on the hull of the enemy cruiser.</p>
<p>This attack caught the enemy off guard. At the same time, our batteries at Bairoko also unleashed a fierce barrage of fire. As a result, the enemy fleet began to lose formation and retreat. They hid behind Rice Anchorage, but continued to bombard Bairoko. A fierce and incomparable artillery battle unfolded. We were lying in the jungle, listening quietly to this artillery battle. During this period, the enemy transport fleet lowered landing craft from the ships, attempting to land troops. The sound of the landing craft colliding with each other could be heard from the sea in the middle of the night. Our artillery fire concentrated on the area where the sound was coming from. The landing craft caught fire one after another and sank into the dark sea. Our battle results for this evening included one cruiser sunk, one destroyer sunk, and one unknown sunk. Only a portion of the enemy soldiers, taking advantage of the darkness, managed to avoid our artillery fire and landed. The rest were repelled.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 5th, only the sound of cannons and bombing could be heard from Munda, but the sky above Bairoko was very quiet. The enemy only landed near Rice Anchorage and took no action. Our Marine Corps soldiers, of course, did not have the chance to raise their eyebrows in triumph, so they simply went to sleep. That night, we said goodbye to 〇〇 headquarters again and lodged in the 〇〇 team near the coast. After dusk, it started raining again in torrents. (Continued on the fourth page)</p>

<h3>The Grain Control Council Will Convene Today: The Procurement and Preparations Committee Will Discuss and Carry Out Procurement Operations in Various Regions</h3>
<p>In order to strengthen [procurement], comprehensively expand the purchase of rice and grain in the Zhejiang and Anhui provinces [and other] regions, the committee has not only divided the areas and dispatched directors and deputy directors to various offices to supervise and guide the purchase of rice and grain, but also established preparatory committees for the rice and grain procurement trade associations in various regions in accordance with the outline of the organization of rice and grain procurement trade associations in various regions. In order to promote the procurement business in various regions, a conference of preparatory members of the regional procurement trade association will be held to realize the purchase of rice and grain as soon as possible. In addition to the unified control opportunities, the chief officials of the first, eighth and seventh district offices, as well as the chief officials of friendly agencies, and the presidents of various newspapers, will participate in the guidance.</p>
<p>The Production and Sales Headquarters Will Conclude on a Fixed Date</p>
<p>The Rice and Grain Production and Sales Headquarters has been established for more than a year. Now that the organization of the Rice Control Committee is fully in place, in order to allow merchants' autonomy to be brought into play, an order has been received from the ministry to handle the conclusion of operations. All operations will be completed by the 20th of this month. Therefore, in principle, the Rice Control Committee will officially take over the rice and grain production and sales matters from the date of the conclusion of the operations of the headquarters. However, although the headquarters will conclude operations on the 20th, the procedures will be completed by the end of the month. Therefore, the time when the Rice Control Committee fully replaces the Procurement and Sales Office will be at the end of this month or the beginning of next month.</p>
<h3>The National Diplomacy Promotion Association Held a Council Meeting and Passed the Resolution to Form a National Diplomacy Delegation</h3>

<h3>The Rationing of Coal Briquettes by Ticket is Under Careful Consideration</h3>
<p>The authorities have a comprehensive plan for the raw materials needed for machine-made coal briquettes in this city and allocate them to various coal briquette factories on a monthly basis. The factories have always maintained a normal state of supply and have never been interrupted. However, due to the relatively loose control over coal briquettes, they are often monopolized by unscrupulous merchants, resulting in frequent shortages in the market and making it difficult for citizens to purchase them. In order to remedy this situation, the authorities concerned are also planning to implement a ticketing system for coal briquettes. This is currently being seriously discussed with the parties concerned.</p>
<h3>The Administration of the Baojia in the First and Eighth Districts Has Been Unified</h3>
<p>Since the recovery of the concessions, citizens have been unclear about the organizational structure of the Baojia system in the First and Eighth Districts and the age regulations for conscripted militia. The Shanghai Social Affairs Department yesterday made inquiries to the Baojia authorities in the First and Eighth Districts as follows:</p>
<p>Organization of Baojia in the First and Eighth Districts</p>
<p>The former public concession Baojia was divided into seven districts and belonged to the Baojia Committee. After the return of the concession administration, the Baojia organization in the First District was directly under the Baojia Office of the First District Police Bureau and was directly governed by the Baojia Office. The Eighth District established a Baojia Branch Office. As a result, the Baojia administration in the two districts tended to be unified. As for the Baojia Committee organized by the citizens, it had no executive power and was only an advisory body to the Baojia authorities.</p>
<p>Age Regulations for Citizens' Service</p>
<p>Regarding the age regulations for citizens serving as militia in the First and Eighth Districts, there are slight differences. The regulations in the First District are stricter. All healthy men between the ages of twenty and forty-five must be on duty. In the Eighth District, the age of service was originally regulated to be between twenty-five and thirty-five, and they were required to draw lots for duty. However, this has recently been changed to be the same as in the First District, requiring citizens between the ages of twenty and forty-five to have the obligation to serve.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Baojia Committee Will Implement Random Household Checks</h3>
<p>Central News Agency: The Municipal Baojia Committee has completed the re-examination of household registration on schedule at the end of last month. In order to ensure that the household registration is thorough and to prevent false reports, the committee will begin random checks of household registration in various districts and has formulated random check methods, which have been submitted to the municipal government for approval. The random check methods are as follows:</p>
<p>Random Check Methods</p>
<p>The random household registration checks will be supervised by personnel dispatched by the committee, together with local police officers and district office personnel, who will supervise the district chiefs, fang chiefs, lianbao chiefs, or township chiefs to handle the matter fairly. The areas to be checked and their start and end dates will be determined by the committee. When carrying out the random household registration checks, the supervisors should wear armbands and badges for identification. All expenses will be paid by the Municipal Baojia Committee and no fees should be collected from residents. Random household registration checks will be conducted daily from 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM. The Baojia chiefs of each district to be checked should immediately inform the residents within their Baojia after receiving the notice, and all men, women, and children should stay at home with their residence certificates ready for verification. Those who are bedridden due to illness may be exempted from the check with the certification of the Baojia chief or two or more co-residents. People who are not at home must personally go to the Baojia chief in charge to verify their residence certificates after returning home. If the personnel of each random check abuse their power or engage in other illegal acts while performing their duties, they will be punished according to law once verified.</p>
<h3>The New Chiefs of the Third Police Bureau Take Office</h3>
<p>In order to strengthen the organization of the Third Police Bureau of the Water City, the internal personnel have been reorganized. Yang, the chief of the Xiafei Branch Bureau, was transferred to the position of secretary. Yang, the chief of the Mai Lan Branch Bureau, was transferred to fill the vacancy, and Xue Gengcui, the chief of the duty inspection, was transferred to the position of chief of the Mai Lan Branch Bureau. The branch chiefs have successively taken office in accordance with orders the day before yesterday. In addition, Secretary Peng Ziqing was transferred to the position of duty inspection chief, and Secretary Yi Yishou was transferred to the Economic Section of the Special Police Department. They also officially took office and reported to work yesterday.</p>
<h3>A Memorial Service Was Held Yesterday for Two Self-Defense Corps Members Who Died in the Line of Duty, and Certificates of Merit and Bonuses Were Awarded</h3>
<p>Shen Heqing and Jiang Chang, members of the Lao Zha area self-defense corps in the First District, died in the line of duty on July 18th while bravely pursuing criminals during a robbery in Fangjiu Xia. All sectors expressed their regret. In order to commend the loyalty of the two martyrs, the Baojia authorities of the Lao Zha District held a memorial service at the Tianchan Stage on Fuzhou Road at 10:00 AM yesterday, and awarded certificates of merit and bonuses from the police authorities. Gu Jiwu, chief of the Baojia Office of the First Police Bureau, Yuan Ludeng, director of the Baojia Guidance Committee, Chen Jiu, executive director, Cheng Liang, Tian Yishishi, chief of the Supervision Office, Hong Yubin, chief of the Lao Zha Branch Bureau, Kori Jun, deputy director of the branch, Wang Lianfang, Baojia district chief of the Lao Zha District, representatives of the various lianbao chiefs, representatives of the Hua community, and more than 2,000 members of the self-defense corps attended. The bereaved families of Shen and Jiang were also present, and Jiang was pregnant with an unborn child of only one month old, which aroused the infinite sympathy of those who came. Accompanied by the music of the Nan Tong Children's Education Institute Orchestra, the atmosphere was solemn. The meeting opened with music, and a three-bow salute was performed to the portraits of Shen and Jiang. After a moment of silence, the chairman reported, and the officials Gu Jiwu, Tian Yishishi, and Hong Hanbin spoke in succession.</p>
<p>Awarding Certificates of Merit and Bonuses</p>
<p>Then, Tian Yishishi, on behalf of the police authorities, presented certificates of merit and bonuses. Jiang was collected by his widow, Jiang Xishi, whose award was "Yi Bo Yuntian [Righteousness Reaching the Sky]," with a bonus of 120,000 yuan. Shen Heqing was received by his mother, Shen, whose award was "Cheng Ren Qu Yi [Achieving Benevolence and Taking Righteousness]," with a bonus of 72,000 yuan. Gu Jiwu and Wang Lianfang jointly distributed consolation money donated by all sectors, totaling 253,334.1 yuan, to be distributed according to the circumstances of the two martyrs' families, with Jiang receiving 6.29 and Shen receiving 3.75, for a total of 124,085.15 yuan for Jiang and 74,451.1 yuan for Shen. The police authorities then awarded bonuses to meritorious corps members Zhou Genlin 2,000 yuan, Chen Linfa 1,500 yuan (the above two gentlemen were collected by their Bao chief Tang Qiongxiang), Xiao Shangpei 1,500 yuan, Zhong Gening 500 yuan, Tao Liqing 300 yuan, and Zhang Shilin 300 yuan, each receiving a certificate of merit. Finally, the Lao Zha Baojia Association awarded bonuses to meritorious corps members Zhou Genlin 1,000 yuan, Chen Linfa 500 yuan, and Yue Shangpei 500 yuan, each receiving a medal inscribed "Courageous and Commendable." The awards were followed by a report on the amount of donations received and the method of payment by the two members of the sales personnel. The meeting ended with a speech by the representative of the Chonghai Township Association, a speech by the lawyer Ji Chaolü on behalf of the bereaved families, and a speech by the self-defense corps member Tang Qiongxiang, in the majestic anthem of the self-defense corps.</p>
<h3>Japanese Self-Defense Corps Members Bravely Rescue the Distressed and the First District Office Awards Certificates of Merit</h3>

Aoki Matao, the chairman of the Gongping Association of the self-defense corps organized by Japanese residents, led the corps members to rescue the six people from danger. The courage and righteousness of the personnel were commendable. Acting Commissioner Chen presented a gratitude certificate as an example. The award ceremony was held in the conference room of the First District Office at 11:00 AM yesterday. Acting Commissioner Chen was unable to attend in person due to official business and was represented by Director Wu.

<h3>School Lecture by the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association for the First Time</h3>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association held a school meeting. The first lecture was held yesterday morning at the Municipal Yucai Middle School. Mr. Zhou Huarun, from the association's secretariat, spoke on "The Path for Youth to Serve the Country." He first described the fallacies of the "Chinese learning as the foundation, Western learning for practical application" ideology of late Qing dynasty middle schools, as well as the detrimental effects of the May Fourth Movement, indiscriminate Westernization, the plagiarism of Anglo-American culture, and communist ideology. He attributed the change in China's near future to the relocation of the National Government to the capital and the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, arguing that only by practicing the Father of Asia's Pan-Asianism could young people truly save the country. The next lecture will be held at 10:00 a.m. on the 25th at the Municipal No. 1 Girls' Middle School on Yuyuan Road (Singapore Road), where Ms. Guan Lu will speak on "Japanese Women."</p>
<h3>Materials Investigation Committee Continues Investigation of Gauze; Plenary Committee Meeting Scheduled for the 22nd</h3>

The investigation work has become even more intense recently. The target of continued investigation remains gauze. In addition to the completion of the investigation of gauze stocks in dyeing and weaving factories, investigations are still underway regarding the gauze stocks of cotton weaving factories and the number of gauze consignments for which yarn number businesses and cloth number businesses have applied for sale or for retention. It is reported that in order to continue to advance the investigation work, the committee has scheduled its fifth committee meeting for 3:00 p.m. on the 22nd of this month to convene all Chinese and Japanese committee members to discuss all matters of progress.</p>
<h3>Postal Service Exclusive Items Must Not Be Impersonated</h3>
<p>Notice from the Post Office Administration of the Yingbao Post Office: It has been found that postal service exclusive items, such as mailbags, uniforms, bicycles, and stationery forms, are all printed with logos, and outsiders must not impersonate or misuse them, otherwise they will be fined. Recently, due to the war situation, or sea disasters, and robberies, etc., postal service exclusive items are inevitably lost to outsiders. The holders, being unaware of violating the law, are very likely to misuse them. Therefore, we hereby announce that anyone who finds or holds the above-mentioned postal service exclusive items should notify or deliver them to the nearest post office for verification. If they are found for sale in stores or by street vendors, they should not be purchased and the nearest post office should be notified. Those who do not comply with the post office's handling will be sent to the military police authorities for legal action. For those who discoverers and holders who voluntarily report to the post office for verification, a considerable reward may be issued after it is verified that there are no other concealed circumstances. Those who have indeed purchased the items and provide reasonable proof may be reimbursed for part or all of the purchase price, taking into account the original price or market price of the relevant items and their depreciation (no reward will be given) to show consideration.</p>
<h3>Fiftieth Issue of Household Flour is All Top-Grade Flour; Complaints Can Be Made If Inferior Flour is Mixed In</h3>
<p>The household flour distributed in the First and Eighth Districts of this city is obtained from the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee of the Commerce Control Committee on a regular basis and distributed in whole numbers to retail rice shops, which issue it to residents upon presentation of coupons. However, the quality of the household flour for the recent 48th and 49th issues was all a mix of second-grade and third-grade flour, making it less palatable. For the current 50th issue of household flour, retail rice shops in the First and Eighth Districts will start selling two catties of top-grade flour from the 15th. According to a Central News Agency reporter's inquiry to the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee, the flour allocated by the committee to the retail rice shops in the First and Eighth Districts is all top-grade flour and does not include any second-grade or third-grade flour. Therefore, citizens who purchase household flour that is of inferior quality or mixed with second- or third-grade flour can report and complain to the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee at No. 2 Beijing Road to have the store's license suspended for investigation.</p>

<h3>First District Public Works Office Hopes Citizens Will Cooperate in Utilizing Garbage, Separating it into Two Parts for Coal Ash to Make Coal Balls</h3>
<p>Central News Agency report: Regarding the garbage problem in the First District, the Central News Agency reporter recently interviewed the director of the Public Works Office of the First District Public Office, who made the following remarks: "The large amount of garbage collected within the jurisdiction of the First District has always been partially used by this office to fill in low-lying areas in the western suburbs of the city, and the remaining portion is transported to rural areas for fertilizer use. The amount of garbage transported out by waterway every day reaches about 1,000 tons. Although the required expenses are considerable, this work has never been neglected for a single day in order to ensure public health and maintain cleanliness within the district. Currently, however, it is essential to conserve materials and reduce expenses. After careful study, it has been decided that from today, the garbage accumulated daily in the district will be divided into two parts: coal ash and ordinary garbage. The coal ash will be used to make coal balls, and the ordinary garbage will be used by farmers in the suburbs of Shanghai as fertilizer. In this regard, I sincerely hope that citizens will enthusiastically cooperate in separating the garbage into the above two categories. Although this work may seem troublesome, I hope that citizens can understand the Bureau's intention to conserve materials and give their full cooperation by storing ordinary garbage in garbage cans and piling coal ash separately in suitable locations within the lanes so that contractors can send workers to transport it. The Cleaning Section of this office plans to dispatch personnel to persuade citizens to cooperate in implementing the above plan so that waste can be utilized and there is no discarded material."</p>

<h3>Investor's Needed Understanding</h3>
<p>Recently, as all parties have recognized the unreliability of hoarding goods and the illegality of speculative behavior, their sights have been focused on factory production enterprises. The well-known factories in Shanghai, with their substantial content, sound management, and products that have always been praised by all parties, are particularly attracting the attention of those with surplus assets. The stock prices of various well-known factories and companies have recently shown a thriving trend, indicating that investors share the same sentiment and understanding. As surplus assets are gradually entering a safe and secure environment, how should our country's industries further enrich their content, improve their management, and actively engage in increasing production? It is the fervent expectation of investors and the most important task for the industrial world to strive for at present.</p>
<p>At the same time, investors should invest properly and have a normal understanding. What is a proper understanding? That is, all investments must be based on on-site observation, thorough investigation, and detailed research into the figures of their assets, the prospects of the factory enterprise, and a detailed analysis to determine the course of action. Only then will the funds be safely and steadily directed, and investors will feel that they can "rest easy." Undoubtedly, it is the responsibility of the industrial world to strive for the progress of the enterprise and the increase in production, and not to disappoint the expectations of investors. The choice, discrimination, and serious research lie within the investors themselves. Therefore, reference materials related to investment research have recently been enthusiastically welcomed by people from all walks of life, and this is the reason.</p>

<h3>Securities Exchange Margin Deposit, Management Methods Agreed Upon, Formal Opening Not Far Away</h3>
<p>The Huashang Securities Exchange has resumed business, but the actual opening date has not yet been determined. The reasons for this are somewhat related to organization, management, personnel, etc. However, according to what the Shanghai News reporter has learned, the issue of margin deposit management is also one of the reasons. The regulations stipulate that brokers of the Securities Exchange must pay a margin deposit, the total amount of which is considerable. The question of who should keep this margin deposit has been the focus of attention. Currently, a concrete solution to this difficulty has been obtained. The Securities Exchange, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce have reached a consensus. Therefore, the date of formal opening can be advanced as a result.</p>
<h3>Regulations for Transporting Soybean Cakes in Various Counties of Jiangsu</h3>
<p>The new method for moving edible oil in various districts of Jiangsu Province has been reviewed by the Provincial Food Bureau and deemed feasible. In the future, this method will be used for applying to move various edible oils. The method is excerpted below:</p>

<h3>Hua Stock Trends</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Hua stocks recovered after falling, because many retail investors saw the high and sold, while the various gangs with capital were still buying as much as possible. Department store and textile stocks were the most resilient. A certain household sold off Xinya Pharmaceutical Factory of the new pharmaceutical industry, which was the only one that showed weakness. Other stocks, such as culture and industry, were all rising. Trading was quite brisk. The market conditions of each stock market are recorded below:</p>
<p>Textile: Yong'an Textile initially fell slightly, but rebounded near noon, rising significantly in the afternoon. Zhongfang's buying momentum expanded, rising considerably. Xinhao also rose; Rong'an set a new high price. Xinfeng Printing and Dyeing had news of stock appreciation due to capital increase, rising suddenly; small-denomination stocks such as Lunhua and Dachina were quite active; Qunfu Shirt and Socks was at the same price.</p>

It is reported that the first edition is nearly sold out and efforts are being made to reprint it again to meet the needs of all sectors.</p>
<h3>Commercial Summary</h3>
<p>Public Bonds: Yesterday's market price can be described as firm, not much different from the market on Saturday. Compared with the small prices before, it has rebounded quite a bit, so the rising trend was blocked again. Bing was not much different from last week. Jia, Yi, Ding, and Wu were mostly outside the market.</p>
<p>Call Loan Interest: The Shanghai Money Industry Association's call loan interest rate remained at two cents.</p>
<p>Japanese Goods: Due to the imminent implementation of per capita allocation by the authorities, genuine users have been reluctant to buy, and the retail sales of the industry have shown a declining trend. The goods are becoming increasingly scarce, so the market price is generally higher than last Saturday.</p>
<p>Incoming Grain: There was a slight increase in incoming goods in the rice market. The merchants' intentions gradually showed weakness, and the market continued to decline. Buyers were watching from the sidelines, and as a result, the price of new japonica rice was slightly lower again. The supply of miscellaneous grains was scarce, with no rising prices. The price of oil grains was high but unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Rayon: Transactions were less frequent than before. Actual sales gradually decreased. The intention of hoarders to sell also softened. The floating interest rate was quite loose, and buying declined.</p>
<h3>A Visit to the Nursery and Kindergarten of the Refugee Children's Education and Shelter</h3>
<p>The Expansion of Production</p>
<p>Entering the yard, the production department is on the right. Chairman Li Heling is hunched over his desk, calculating business accounts. Next to him, the boys and girls in the net bag department are working busily.</p>
<p>It is said that initially, workshop activities were considered a type of curriculum to train production skills, with the aim of creating future career paths. However, due to limited funding, not many students could participate, and the results were not significant. Later, it was decided that middle and high school students would participate in part-time work and study. To help the institute's finances, the production team was reorganized into a production department, and a production committee was established, allocating 60,000 yuan as seed money to expand the wickerwork and machine grinding departments. Mr. Li was responsible for the theory and sales and management work. After the production movement expanded, it achieved remarkable results, and business flourished, with daily sales reaching over 10,000 yuan. Later, new-style grinders were added, gradually making production a driving force in the institute's economy. The production department was originally divided into (1) grinding, (2) wickerwork, and (3) net bag sections, with three staff members and hired technicians for guidance. Children participating in the work also received bonuses and allowances, which were saved for them.</p>
<p>The wickerwork department was the first to be established. After expansion, nearly one-tenth of the children in the institute participated in the work. The teaching methods were constantly improved, righteous principles were incorporated, organization was strengthened, management was perfected, and training was actively carried out. Not long ago, two wickerwork retail outlets were established at the intersection of Xinzha Road and Datong Road and at No. 1054 Feifei Road, resulting in a significant increase in production and sales. Although they have now closed, major companies and merchants still directly purchase products from the institute, including tables, chairs, bed frames, cradles, strollers, thermos shells, etc. It is said that every finished product undergoes rigorous inspection by technicians and managers, and the quality and craftsmanship are above average, and the price is lower, so it is well-regarded by all parties.</p>
<p>The grinding department has also been in operation for more than a year and has a 7.5 horsepower small motor donated by Mr. Zhang Chunyan. At that time, the children in the institute had a high enthusiasm for production. Their own report stated that "graduates themselves clearly understand that they should first participate in production work." The bell is the work signal for the grinding department. Motors and grinders roar at 11:20 AM and 5:00 PM. A group of children covered in white flour are skillfully and adeptly performing their tasks, some weighing, some picking, some sifting, some grinding, some packaging. However, due to food rationing and other reasons, the grinding department has been temporarily shut down.</p>
<p>Currently, besides the wickerwork department, the only other production department is the net bag department, which was established most recently, but the results seem to be very good. The children even organized their own sales teams to promote and solicit orders from all walks of life. Some wholesalers, appreciating the quality and low price of the products, often go to purchase them in bulk.</p>
<p>The production activities of the Xu Gong Memorial Branch mainly focus on agriculture. They have rented the famous Lantang farmland of the former Jiangsu Rural Normal School. There is housing, a river, and over 20 acres of arable land. The soybeans planted there are almost ready for harvest, and preparations are being made to plant wheat, expanding the area to 44 acres. The various vegetables planted along the river are already sufficient to meet the needs of the branch!</p>
<p>Group Living</p>
<p>The lives of the children in the nursery symbolize the future of a new China. All teachers and students raise the flag in the morning and lower it in the evening. In the solemn ceremony, everyone feels their responsibility to the country. The national flag rises in the morning sun, and below, the children agilely perform morning exercises and begin their academic life. Especially meaningful are the academic competitions. Because no one wants to fall behind, everyone is making progress. It is said that due to reasonable competition, almost all children who initially entered the institute with poor qualities have changed for the better after two weeks of training.</p>
<p>The children have their own children's organization, with activity time after 5:00 PM every day. The children's organization is divided into five departments: training department, with cadre training classes implementing autonomy; academic department, responsible for alarms and libraries; public security department, with small courts, disciplinary teams, and patrol teams. When you visit, children from each grade and class salute, just like in a military school. The service department has labor, sanitation, nursing, laundry, and cooking teams. The recreation department is responsible for sports activities, chess, singing, and ping-pong teams.</p>
<p>The strong self-governance of the refugee children is fully demonstrated in the nursery, probably because they grew up in the wild. Even very young children can take care of themselves and are very good at organizing themselves. With the guidance of the instructors, the results are particularly excellent.</p>
<p>The refugee children are also very creative. For example, due to a lack of materials, they can use their skills to transform waste into practical items. They collect used soap shavings, boil them in water, and turn them into whole bars of soap. They twist yarn from old socks and make clothing knots and bags. They collect scrap fabric to mend clothes, even piecing together "brocade garments." They also collect scrap cotton, small nails, rice grains, and cardboard to make various practical items and toys.</p>
<p>The labor team is the biggest characteristic of the lives of the students in the nursery. The catering team wears white aprons with three red characters "Catering Team" and an Arabic numeral. Hauling coal, filtering water, burning firewood, and cooking rice are all done by the children themselves, with only two supervisors providing guidance. The "cleaning team" gathers every morning, after meals, and after school to receive their assigned tasks, then disperses to perform their cleaning duties. The principal also runs around, inspecting and recording results, maintaining the cleanliness and energetic appearance of the entire institute. In addition, there is a "sewing team" composed of over twenty girls. They not only mend torn clothes for the entire institute, but also take on the task of making new clothes when the institute needs them. In the past, every child in the institute had a set of work clothes, and the navy uniforms needed for the performance at the Lihua Grand Theater were all made by their little hands!</p>
<p>Mass Living</p>
<h3>The Confession of an Accountant</h3>
<p>— A Morning Dream</p>
<p>I am an accountant (cashier) in an old-fashioned factory. Those who hear the term "accountant" may think that the position is quite pleasant. However, this is not something that outsiders can understand. In reality, the treatment of an accountant is as meager as that of a teacher.</p>
<p>Prices are constantly rising, but our salaries have always been slow to increase. Even if the boss occasionally has a change of heart and adds a little, the amount of increase is limited. In this era of high prices, what can you do with this meager monthly salary of 200 yuan? It is difficult to support my family, let alone my own personal life. Apart from the stipulated salary, there is no unexpected income each month. The work is so busy that it is like doing the work of three people at once. From the manager to the apprentices, I have to deal with everything alone, and there is never a moment of free time. The responsibility is heavy, as you can imagine. All the income and expenditure of money goes through my hands. Sometimes, because I am too busy, I forget to record a payment, or I mistakenly miscount the amount of money. At that time, I have no choice but to compensate with my own money. If the amount is small, I can afford it. If the shortage is too large, it is unimaginable. No matter how careful you are, it is inevitable that accountants will have to pay compensation. This is truly like the saying: "Eating cold rice with a sour taste."</p>
<p>Seeing the red, blue, five-yuan, ten-yuan, and even hundred-yuan banknotes flowing in and out of my hands all day long, but thinking about the food for my family of four, I am truly worried about the future. Therefore, I can only sigh all day long while counting money.</p>
<p>My daily life has already been reduced to the point where there is no room for further reduction. I neither smoke nor drink, and I haven't stepped into an entertainment venue for years. I rarely go out. When I do, it is to save money on transportation. I never attend any banquets, and even when invited by friends, I always make excuses that I am busy with work and politely decline. I haven't made a new set of clothes in years. All I wear are old, tattered cloth gowns patched with holes. Therefore, the apprentices in the factory all call me "Accountant" very affectionately on the surface, but behind my back, they all call me "Moldy Old Man." Indeed, I myself admit that I am very unlucky. Is this the life that an accountant should live? Or perhaps the life of a poor teacher!</p>

<h3>(Continued from Issue 2) In the Air Raid Shelter</h3>
<p>At half past midnight, more cannon fire was heard at Kra. Though sparse, the sounds of cannon in the rain were very powerful, a testament to our mine warfare squadrons' encounter with an enemy fleet. Our mine warfare squadron, fighting at 〇〇, was comprised of 〇〇 ships that entered Kra Bay just as troops were withdrawing to the eastern shore of Klumpang-Kara Island. Enemy ship shadows drifted across the dark sea. The enemy fleet consisted of a score of ships, including cruisers and destroyers. Our side launched a fierce torpedo attack, their specialty, against the enemy fleet. Shells rained down. By the time another unit, hearing the cannon fire, turned back from the Bruas-Hai Strait, the enemy had already been repelled. Our forces completed the operation and were already returning, having sunk two Class B cruisers and one special service vessel.</p>
<p>The rain continued into the morning of the sixth. The air in the forest cellar was unbreathable. The cloth shoes were saturated with water. Matches and cigarettes were soaked through, impossible to light. Enemy planes circled overhead, haphazardly dropping bombs along the roads, cratering the jungle like a checkerboard. Reconnaissance planes dipped low over the jungle. The tips of the branches were whipped by the aircraft engines, wavering back and forth. They were searching for our artillery positions. The soldiers, their impulse to shoot it down repressed by the captain, could only clench their fists and stare. It was a truly bitter struggle. That day, we took shelter in the air raid shelter thirty-five times.</p>
<h3>Debris of Enemy Ships Drifting with the Wind</h3>
<p>At 〇〇 in the afternoon, the artillery batteries at 〇〇 began to bombard. This was an attack on enemy troops landing in Songkhla Bay. Amid the thunderous cannon fire, we crossed over to Klumpang-Kara Island. A boat carried eight wounded brave men from the night battle on the fourth. This boat was the one abandoned by the enemy last night and commandeered by our team. The rain stopped, and small stars twinkled shyly in the sky. Kra Bay felt truly peaceful. Heavy oil, overturned boats, and lumber floated on the sea. These were the remains of enemy ships sunk in Kra Bay during the naval battles of the fourth and fifth. Reinforcements for Pailok were garrisoned in the coconut groves along the coast of Klumpang-Kara. That night, we stayed with the 〇〇 unit nearest the coast.</p>
<p>The seventh was a clear, fine day. We were jostled in transport trucks, delivered to the marine corps camp. Such a fine day continued until the ninth, the day we left Klumpang-Kara Island. But the intensity of enemy bombing there was also very severe. The enemy's bombing was fierce, and our ground artillery fire was equally intense. Our bomber planes also bombed the enemy landing on Ko Lanta and Rice Bay day and night. Our fighters pursued the invading enemy fighters, opening up a fierce and unparalleled war from Kra Bay to the skies above Klumpang-Kara. Our naval reconnaissance planes, tasked with night patrols, were very brave. Late on the night of the seventh, a single plane audaciously attacked a large enemy fleet of over a score of cruisers and destroyers attempting to enter Kra Bay off Ko Lanta, forcing them to turn back. Perhaps the enemy wanted to return to resupply.</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Drop Food Supplies</h3>
<p>The thunderous sounds of cannon fire from Mung and Ko Lanta were audible every day. Especially intense was the artillery battle that took place from the night of the eighth through the morning of the ninth. I witnessed this on a boat in the ocean. Enemy planes flew over our heads, heading towards Mung. Before long, it seemed a large flare was launched high into the sky over Mung, and under its light, artillery fire began. This was artillery fired by the enemy on Ko Lanta.</p>
<p>It was about 〇〇 AM on the ninth. We heard a burst of machine-gun fire, like popping beans, coming from the direction of Pailok. This was the encounter between our reinforcements and enemy soldiers landing in Rice Bay. It was said that this battle had started at dawn on the eighth. At 2 PM, the lookout spotted enemy planes dropping many small parachutes over Rice Bay. The parachutes were colored blue and red. 〇〇 Officer said, "They're dropping food supplies." That night, we boarded the 〇〇 destroyer and left Klumpang-Kara Island. (Translated from the Asahi Shimbun, October 4)</p>

<h3>From Employee Embezzlement to Personnel Management</h3>
<p>— Half Page</p>
<p>Recently, news about employee embezzlement and flight has been frequently seen in newspapers and heard in conversations. After these incidents occur, there are often several different opinions in public discourse: some believe that embezzling employees simply do not know the law and that they must be arrested, handed over to the authorities, and punished according to the law; only in this way can legal order be maintained and evildoers be warned. Others believe that current employee compensation is too low, unable to withstand the impact of the cost of living; embezzlement is caused by the environment, and the responsibility lies in the self-reflection of the employers. Still others take a third-party perspective, arguing that the inability of employees to secure a stable life is indeed a cause of embezzlement, but in reality, employees who abscond with large sums rarely have stockpiled large quantities of rice and firewood. Instead, they are often driven to corruption by failed speculation, gambling debts, and other adverse environmental inducements. Therefore, they place the responsibility on society.</p>
<p>To be fair, all of these reasons have some merit. The occurrence of an incident is often the result of a combination of factors. Now, to prevent the continued spread of such incidents, in addition to the responsibility of society, which the social authorities should pay attention to eliminating, I believe that the focus should still be on the personnel management of the organizations themselves, and the following points are particularly urgent and should be improved:</p>
<p>Improvement of Compensation: The rapid increase in the cost of living in recent years is truly alarming. According to statistics, the increase was limited from the beginning of the war until May 1938, and it was still less than 60% by May 1939. By May of last year, it had risen to just under 17.5 times, but in May of this year, it has already risen to over 48 times. According to wage theory, wages should be determined by the minimum cost of living, that is, monetary wages should be proportional to the actual cost of living. This July, the News Daily held a symposium on wage issues. According to the report of Mr. Cai Zhiya, a family of five requires at least 62 essential goods. Based on July's prices, employees need at least 3,070 yuan per month to maintain their minimum living standard. How many organizations currently have employees who can reach this minimum living wage standard? Moreover, prices are constantly changing, and the rice ration for August and September has been reduced again. Employees cannot secure a stable life. Although they are physically present in the office, their minds are still preoccupied with daily necessities. In such a situation, the effectiveness of their work is out of the question, and cunning individuals will seize opportunities to take advantage, and bad intentions will arise! Therefore, to achieve administrative efficiency, business development, and prevention of corruption, ensuring employees' livelihood is a prerequisite.</p>
<p>Guidance on Leisure Activities: Leisure life is originally a part of human life activities. Employees are mentally exhausted from working all day. To maintain their physical and mental health, normal leisure activities should be provided after work, such as ball games, chess competitions, musical performances, etc. Larger organizations can host their own events, and smaller ones can hold joint events. These activities should be listed as legitimate expenses by the organizations. These activities can cultivate the mind, connect emotions, and unconsciously foster the virtues of cooperation, fairness, orderliness, and love for the group. If employees can maintain their minimum living standards and have normal activities for recreation, then all crooked and evil thoughts can be eliminated, and they can focus on promoting their own careers. As the saying goes, "Idleness breeds trouble." Promoting normal activities to replace general activities such as playing cards, dog racing, and dancing is also an important aspect of personnel management that cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Emotional Communication: I am deeply concerned that in many organizations today, there is too much distance between superiors and subordinates. It can be said that there is only response to orders, and very little emotional harmony. Many employees who have served for many years still have their names and faces unknown to the manager. With so few opportunities for contact, suspicion, resentment, and misunderstanding easily arise between them, and sympathy and understanding are not obtained. At the same time, superiors are indifferent to their subordinates, treating them as strangers, and subordinates do not see their superiors as anything more than passersby, making it difficult to offer loyal service! The Book of Changes says, "Treating subordinates with indifference leads to their loss of righteousness," which is exactly what I mean! This is a common problem in organizations today. I believe that there should be opportunities for individual or group discussions among the various levels of an organization. Family situations, personal interests, and opinions on the business itself can be discussed freely. Problems can be solved, and opinions can be adopted. Through these discussions, not only can there be a meeting of minds, but superiors can also observe their subordinates' origins, and understand their peace of mind, which is also a good reference for promotion and deployment.</p>
<p>Strict Examination: Some people believe that in hiring, one should "use without suspicion, suspect and do not use." Indeed, many subordinates in various places are often hindered and constrained because they do not have the full trust of their superiors. This is very frustrating for those who do the work. However, I believe that while trust is acceptable, excessive trust can easily turn into laissez-faire. Once laissez-faire is adopted, internal betrayal often follows. In history and society, we often see cases of trouble arising within the walls and changes occurring at the elbow, which is due to deep trust and negligence in prevention. Therefore, within an organization, while public interaction can be like family, within the scope of one's duties, one should strive for fairness and impartiality. In particular, attention should be paid to those who are public-spirited and law-abiding, and they should be allowed to remain in their positions. Do not be misled by those who flatter and fawn. The so-called "enforcement of both kindness and strictness, clear rewards and punishments" is the essence of using people.</p>
<p>Cultivating a Frugal Atmosphere: Since the war, Shanghai, with its special circumstances, has created many opportunities for merchants. The enjoyment of life and extravagance in conduct have become unparalleled, creating an extremely vain and frivolous atmosphere in society. Japanese economic expert Yoshida Seiji, in his article "A Study of China's Price Problem," mentioned the scene of Shanghai people indulging in extravagant enjoyment and reckless spending at banquets at the International Hotel. I don't know if this is praise or sarcasm. Should people in wartime be indulging in extravagant enjoyment? And I think the characters in this picture are mostly officials and businessmen! As the war continues and resources become increasingly scarce, the savings movement is a widespread movement in warring countries, and the government is making great efforts to promote and publicize it. Officials and businessmen should reflect on this. I have also seen a trainee, not yet twenty years old, wearing a well-tailored suit, smoking a pipe, and acting important. Although everyone is free to choose their clothing preferences, the atmosphere encourages everyone to dress up to show their status, and therefore, they have to find other ways to make ends meet. Therefore, every organization, especially during this wartime, should refer to the New National Movement and the Savings Regulations in promoting the daily lives and activities of its employees. This will not only help the implementation of national policies but also have a significant impact on the atmosphere of the organization itself.</p>
<p>Encouraging Academic and Technical Research: The progress of all careers depends on continuous efforts and improvements. But we have seen that in many commercial organizations, all facilities have been the same for ten years, following the old rules and regulations as if they cannot be changed. This conservatism is a Chinese characteristic, but it is also laziness. The spirit of research is the most neglected aspect of current organizations. The belief is that simply piling up goods with money can make money, and there is no need to talk about adult education, accounting, or personnel management. In fact, good times will not last long. After the war, how will we survive in a competitive market? Zhu Zhixin once said, "An employee who does not read books is not loyal to his career." But we often see in newspapers that trainees and apprentices are often subjected to terrible and ruthless beatings for stealing time to read, which is infuriating. I believe that public opinion should awaken them to this fact. Trainees and apprentices should be instructed to study and make up for their lack of experience at the expense of the company, and employees should be encouraged to conduct research and write papers so that their valuable experiences in their careers can be passed on to others, or to publicly discuss and solve difficult problems. Therefore, larger organizations should have libraries and publications. Currently, prices of paper are very expensive, and there may be difficulties in resources, but now various industries have public associations, and this matter can also be handled by the associations. The content of publications can include announcements, notices, compilations of laws and regulations, news dissemination, which can avoid the cost and tediousness of many official letters. Discussions on certain issues, mutual visits and reports, personal lives, literary writing, and other interesting essays can all be included. Matters related to themselves will often feel particularly interesting and willing to approach. This can promote the connection of feelings between industries or colleagues, the introduction of knowledge, and the transmission of news. It is a very valuable undertaking. With the establishment of libraries and publications, employees can have their spirits supported and avoid external distractions, reducing many unnecessary social events and consumption. Personnel issues are complex and numerous. The above is just one aspect.</p>
<h3>How to Adjust the Coal Briquette Supply</h3>
<p>Implement Price Controls, Improve Coal Quality</p>
<p>Recently, there has been panic regarding coal briquettes in this city. It seems that all coal factories, due to the authorities' price limits, have had to alter the materials used. For example, they increase costs through extra commissions and various pretexts. The actual quality of the coal is poor, like pebbles. It has no heating power and burns too quickly.</p>
<p>This situation is nothing more than the authorities' weak enforcement. Now the black market price will become the official price, and the coal quality is like pebbles. Who is responsible? It only increases the suffering of the people. The solution to the fuel problem urgently needs to be addressed. Regarding the improvement of coal quality, it is hoped that major coal merchants will retain some sense of public morality. This is the boundless hope of all citizens. (Jian Qing)</p>
<p>Distribute Coal Dust, Make Coal Briquettes</p>
<p>A recent newspaper reported, "Coal briquettes, an essential fuel for residents every day, are expected to become scarce soon. Many retail stores are selling them at prices higher than the controlled price, causing inconvenience to residents. This situation, if prolonged, will greatly impact people's livelihood and stability. Therefore, the authorities plan to implement a rationing system to meet legitimate needs." This shows that the authorities are concerned about people's livelihood, and the common people should be grateful.</p>
<p>However, I believe that the essence of coal briquettes is smokeless coal dust mixed with a small amount of soil to solidify it. There is no need for coal briquette factories to manufacture them. Once factories are involved in manufacturing, each ton requires about two hundred yuan in manufacturing costs, increasing the burden on residents. For the factories, they still incur losses. Therefore, there have been recent rumors of price increases. According to the raw material, smokeless coal dust, its price has remained around three hundred yuan since rationing began. This is because the authorities care about people's livelihood and are reluctant to increase it. The reason why coal briquettes have increased in price several times is solely due to increased manufacturing costs. If the authorities directly ration smokeless coal dust to residents and let them manufacture it themselves (the method is simple: take coal dust, add two-tenths of soil, add a little water, mix it, divide it into small pieces, and dry it in the sun or bake it with fire), it can save residents a great manufacturing cost burden. The authorities can then transfer the important materials used by coal briquette factories for manufacturing large quantities of coal briquettes – electricity, baking oil, hardware, etc. – to other more important uses. This is very consistent with the currently advocated conservation movement.</p>
<p>Furthermore, coal briquette manufacturers, citing losses, crudely manufacture coal briquettes. Half of their material is soil and coal refuse, and half is smokeless coal dust. Therefore, the heating power is low, and the consumption is high. Residents are full of complaints, hoping that the authorities will improve the situation. However, coal briquette manufacturers not only have no intention of improving but also frequently use the excuse of broken machinery to reduce production, creating a fuel panic to achieve their goal of raising prices. At the same time, they supply raw material coal dust to the black market (as reported in the September 8th news) or hoard large quantities, waiting for higher prices. These people only seek their own selfish desires, disregard the authorities' efforts, and the interests of the public. Their bad behavior is very hateful. If the authorities can redistribute smokeless coal dust to residents, it can not only reduce the burden on residents and save important materials but also quell part of the black market and eliminate fuel panic forever. It is truly a win-win situation.</p>
<p>Some might say that it is too troublesome for residents to manually manufacture coal briquettes. However, the current coal briquettes are of poor quality and lack viscosity, soon falling apart (some residents deliberately break them because broken pieces burn more easily). All of these require re-manufacturing, which is no different from making them yourself with coal dust. Moreover, coal dust can be placed anywhere, unlike coal briquettes, which must be stored indoors to prevent moisture. Residents can take it at any time to make high-quality fuel. Because the manufacturing method is simple, they will become skilled over time. I believe residents will not find it troublesome but will find it convenient.</p>
<p>However, coal briquette manufacturers and retail stores will inevitably close down as a result. Although it is a local problem, it is not a way to stabilize people's livelihood. The authorities should stipulate a legal profit margin, and the coal dust should still be supplied through them to maintain their business. This would be beneficial in every way.</p>
<p>On October 12th, the director of the Coal Association's Dajiao Affairs Bureau stated in the newspaper: "In this decisive battle, wasting resources is not allowed. This is naturally the right thing to do. Especially coal, as the most important resource in the decisive battle, must be used sparingly. Adjust consumption for non-essential items, those with substitutes, and those with room for savings." If this is true, then coal briquette factories' manufacturing of coal briquettes is almost extravagant and can be replaced by residents making them themselves. This may also be a benefit to the national economy and people's livelihood. It is hoped that the authorities will study this and society will encourage it. (Shuguang)</p>

<h3>China Youth Society Old Book Service Helps Education</h3>
<p>The Middle School Fellowship of the Youth Department of the Youth Society held the "China Youth Old Book Service Society" during the school season. The accounts have now been settled. A total of 750 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates was obtained under the student loan fund. Among them, 200 yuan was donated to the Youth Society's orphaned children's loan, and the remaining 550 yuan was specifically donated to the loan fund of this newspaper. Their sincerity is commendable. As for the details of the account, it will be announced separately by the Society to ensure credibility.</p>
<h3>Free School News</h3>
<p>The Xiuneng Free Vocational Supplementary Night School (formerly Fenglin Free Night School) was originally scheduled to start classes today (the 18th). Because everything is not yet ready, it has been changed to officially start classes on the 25th. There are still a few places left. Register as soon as possible. Registration location: Room 301, Meiqi Building, 996 Jing'an Temple Road. Tuition fees are not charged.</p>
<p>Liang Jingjun founded a free school, and Wu Xiangkang donated 2,570 yuan saved from children's expenses. School directors Li Fenglin, Yu Fengqi, and Yuan Baogen each donated 1,000 yuan, and Qichang Hotel donated six desks. All are voluntary donations.</p>
<h3>Mr. Zhu Jiazhen's Scholarship Helps Education</h3>
<p>Respectfully reported: Jiazhen is currently a senior student in the Chemistry Department of the Science College of Shanghai Jiaotong University. He recently received a letter from the school authorities saying, "Upon investigation of Wencong's academic performance during his studies at the school, he has been the top student in the entire college for the past three years, indicating his diligent study. We commend him greatly and specially award him a Rongyu (Honor) scholarship of 1,200 yuan to encourage him and hope that he will continue to work hard to improve his performance in the next semester, not lose the honor he has already obtained, and always be a model for his classmates. We have great expectations," etc. Jiazhen was initially happy upon receiving this, but then felt ashamed. He thought that he had been well-educated and cared for by his parents for twenty years, and that he was about to complete his university studies. Compared to those poor students who had to drop out due to financial difficulties, he already felt very fortunate. Now, with his foolish talent and fortunate grades, he has received funds from enthusiastic educators in society. Their original intention was to encourage young students to make progress, but Jiazhen felt uneasy. He remembered that his father had founded the family's student loan fund seven years ago. Although the scope was very small, it was the first to start the student loan trend in our family. This spring, due to financial constraints, new loans were stopped. All old loans to students who had not yet graduated were still issued on time. He often encouraged Jiazhen's sisters and brothers, saying, "This matter has been carried out for ten terms, but it has not yet fulfilled my aspirations. After you have established yourselves, you should continue to do it for me in the spirit of 'establishing oneself and helping others'." At this time, Jiazhen's educational needs were entirely dependent on his father's payment. The realization of his father's instructions was far away. However, considering his personal feelings and the family's current environment, especially his father's usual attitude in dealing with people, there was no reason to accept this scholarship. Therefore, he informed his father and decided to donate 600 yuan of the funds to the Shanghai Student Loan Fund and 300 yuan to the Xinwen Bao Student Loan Fund. The remaining 300 yuan was donated to your newspaper's educational assistance fund to promote the original intention of Mr. Zhao's scholarship. Jiazhen is deeply grateful and will study hard to live up to the expectations of enthusiastic people in society. Respectfully submitted by Zhu Jiazhen.</p>
