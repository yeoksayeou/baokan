<p>社評</p>
<h3>中日經濟協力的前瞻</h3>
<p>日本經濟使節國一行，已於日昨飛返東京，該國此次遠來吾國，以民間經濟使節的資格，在京滬二地與經濟界人士及當局坦白　談，其所成就，當有未可限量者，我們在歡送使節國一行返國之際，極願向該國諸君及中日經濟界人士，更進出境　，以求中日兩國經濟協力之順利發展，爲大東亞共榮國經濟樹立勞固之基礎。</p>
<p>此次日本經濟使節國訪問我國，雖爲純粹民間的組織，然在此大東亞戰爭及世界戰局迫於決戰階段之今日，如何集結中日兩國經濟力以求勝利，實有極端重要的意義，所以，該國此行之重要性，當爲兩國經濟界領導者所共　，在我國經濟界，則更以陷於遍身是病狀態，在痛苦呻吟之中，見友邦經濟使節之蒞臨，無　爲經濟醫師，期待其細心診斷，指導洽療，庶可解吾沉屙，以興友邦共同協力，故吾人不惜敝舌焦辱，坦白陳述吾國經濟之症狀，病源，特殊環境及其重要危機等，務使使節團諸君得以明瞭真相，現在使節團一行業已完成其任務而返國，對於本報連日社評所述及我國各界所提供之種種材料，務望加以深切之注意，給我們以正確的指示，因爲我們所提的是病狀，而我們所期待于經濟醫師們者，則是治療我們經濟沉屙的處方啊！</p>
<p>小倉正恒團長于日昨臨別之際，發表考慮感想，已有初步的寶貴的指示，我們非常感謝，小倉氏說：「吾人即爲增强戰力設，深願　官民一體，盡全部智慧，以努力於中日經濟之協力，惟日本方面有日本之特　，而同樣，中國亦有其特質，吾等深感有活用其特質之必要。」這是今後中日經濟協力事業的前提，否則，一切努力，就不免幹格不入，結果或竟與原意相反，使節團返國後，對於此點，必能提醒友邦各界，共同注意，然而，今日中國經濟最嚴重之問題，乃在經濟範圍內各方面的沉屙，乃在經濟事業之停滯與國民經濟生活之危岌，如何指示治療與救濟之法，實爲吾人之所切望於友邦經濟使節團返國後首先努力者，　以一病勢力沉重的中國經濟界，而言與友邦協力，在事實上是不可能的，小倉團長臨別感想中述及「關於以上海爲中心之物價通貨，增强生產及食量等問題，至重且大，其對策尚須慎重加以考慮，因此餘等返日後，深願根據此次考察所得，與各方面協商後，再向政府方面建議」，這幾句話，使我們感到安慰，使我們增加迫切期待之情。</p>
<p>小倉團長特別指示我們，由於中日兩國各有其國情與經濟上的特殊性，「故當謀强化中國經濟與中國經濟協力提攜之時，其具體方法誠有對此點充分加以注意之必要」而「要知對方之特質，若非實地接觸當地人士或風物，殊難瞭解」，因此，我們歡迎日本經濟界領導人物，今後能隨時蒞華，實地考察，多方接觸，以增加對我國各方面實情之瞭解，同時，我們更須在此喚起國人之注意者，即「來而不往，非禮也」我們繼日本經濟使節團之後，即應有中華民國經濟使節團答訪日本友邦，但我們同時應該知道，訪日經濟使節團，決不僅僅是爲了禮義上的往還，而且也是爲了事實上的需要，除了答訪之外，至少尚有幾　意義：第一，是在日本經濟使節團返國與各方面協商之時，容有問題發生，我們可以就近披　真情，以供參酌，使今後中日經濟協力與提攜，更　萬全；第二，是觀光友邦戰時經濟諸設施，一以供我國決定對日經濟協力工作之方向及內容，期無重複，瑣細及其他遺憾，一切供我國經濟復興之借鏡，因此，我們必須派遣經濟我們答訪團赴日，而且在事前必須有充分的準備，庶不致除了禮義的酬酢之外，毫無實際裨益。</p>
<p>中日兩國，今日在大東亞戰爭中固有最密切關係，即在將來和平時期，也有　曲手足之誼，中日兩國經濟之互相依存，殆爲勢所必然，在中國立場說，沒有一個經濟上居世界優越地位的日本，即不免有受歐美列强壓柞之危險；但從日本利害論，如東亞沒有一個經濟上能夠獨立發展而日趨發達的中國，則對於日本在世界上的地位，自亦不免有　亡齒寒之感，我們　今日及今後之中日經濟協力，對於這一基本原則，必須首先把握得住，然後，兩國乃能如手如足，互相提攜，互通有無，互助發展，爲此，我們更希望今後增進兩國民間經濟界的親密接觸，由往還頻繁而逐漸樹立兩國經濟界之民間性格的經常會議，以促進兩國經濟之協力合作事業，這是我們所　香　祝的。</p>

<h3>緬甸前線的日軍勇士　克服暴雨泥濘毒蛇和疫癘</h3>
<p>世界降雨量最大的緬印國境的日軍第一線陣地，朝夕在與大自然的暴威「雨季將軍」鬥爭中過去，在阿拉貢山　　　叩印度正面的日軍第一線將士之輯昂的士氣，正有直沖鬥　之概，北部緬印國境　高原一帶地方，將士除須抵　　的　　之外，更須　到暴雨、泥濘、毒蛇，惡疫等四種東西，我們接觸到　墨難以形容的前線將士們的辛勞生活時，盡忠之念，油然而生。</p>
<p>險地行車</p>
<p>此地自六月初　即入雨季，與下緬甸地方的雨季不同，那雨似瀑布般直瀉下來，車輛都隧等先前在行軍途中所搭架的　　，一經暴雨，即被沖去，道路泥濘沒　，行軍常　於不可能的境地，　　中裏　最感缺乏，最近僅賴乾燥野菜以維持，偶而食到送來的山薯時，將士們　相視苦笑。</p>
<p>牛肉自天而降</p>
<p>但即在　僻遠的地方，也　到邱吉兩的賞賜，那就是被不分皂白而　炸的敵機所炸到的牛的肉，敵機去後，兵士們向空申謝，謝謝最討厭的東西的毒蛇與蠍子，　蠍子是緬甸的名物，他們潛藏於洗　物與軍靴中，軍隊中對之大感頭痛，又丈餘長的可怖的大蛇，往往爬到營帳上，　醒兵士們的好　，五月二十四日經幾次白刃戰後佔據的某地新戰場，在最後的突擊戰中壯烈殉國的某隊長墓前，供有類似大波斯菊的一朵花，在其墓　前　　得分的將士們，凝眸注視某部長的炮隊　時，偶見敵陣中血色惡劣的英人將校出現於　帳外，歷歷如在目前。</p>
<p>阿拉貢之悲劇</p>
<p>至於南部國境，在先前的確大　　戰中擊　出出之敵，使呼號　回緬甸之敵以「阿拉伯之悲劇」告終而建殊動的將士們，佈置了　固的陣線，以等待來日的戰事，此方面將士的勞苦，也不是我們所能想像的，只訓練有素，素聞　素，　說無比的日本軍人，始能忍受。</p>
<p>淒風苦雨和衣眠</p>
<p>在第一線陣地，森林中張著　帳，與敵對　，　　　油衣，和衣　眠的將士們的枕席，被淒涼而悲切的夜雨所濡　，　事亦不能隨心所欲，因　　補給的不足，將士們常捕食野　烤食。</p>
<p>後方部隊的辛勞，亦不較第一線部隊稍　，例如運輸部隊，需經泥濘沒膝的惡劣道路，以　運輸的重任，阿拉貢山的險峻，直如　道之難，危崖險壁，不計其數，然而如不日以繼夜的經過那險道而運輸，則第一線陣地便有　成「　上孤島」的危險，將士們把癮疾等滿不當一回事，一天天的克服一切困難，燃起戰鬥的精神，向擊滅敵人邁進。（　：譯自七月十一日西部朝日新聞緬甸國境前線特批）</p>

<p>物資調查委員會，於上周間開始工作後，對本市物資之調查，業已將本市六十處之營業倉庫所藏之棉紗布，作一初步之調查。本周內將進行更縝密之調查工作，並將調查所獲之資料，交由調查組作一詳細審查，而進行換滅操縱物價之囤戶。據關係方面稱，該會此後調查物資之範圍，將由工部局管轄下之營業倉庫，擴大至全上海之倉庫堆機或更檢查私人房屬。又悉該公會爲收效宏大起見，將實施國債吿密者之獎勵辦法云。</p>
<h3>華中煙草配給組合　加緊督查工作　採取有效辦法予以制裁</h3>
<p>華中煙草配給組合鑒於捲煙黑市愈趨猖獗，爲杜絕黑市轉販牟利起見，特規定有效制裁辦法，通飭各卸賣商小賣商遵照辦理。（一）煙草須依照所規定價格售之。（二）所派捲煙平均十日發售。（三）不得囤積或藉口不售。（四）發售時一律拆開封口。（五）孩童不准購買。（六）每人購買以一包爲限，同時特派監督員澈查各經銷行號賬冊。對違反以上規定者，以參加黑市交易論，除吊銷派貨卡外並予以嚴懲。現今黑市交易，全爲投機者所造成，黑市價格竟超過限價幾近一倍，故一般吸戶欲購買捲煙又學，聞該組合已據報吿，所以連日之督查工作，業已加緊，若干經銷行號犯有嫌疑，已予暫停派貨之處分。同時有若干甲。乙卡，經查明不合格已予降級，對於五月一日以前已申請登記示獲派貨之行號，將予分別調查核定等級，以便發卡發貨。此外並與有關當局協商取締漕河涇以及寗波路之捲煙經營黑市。</p>
<h3>華中荳類增產　食油可自給　一部口油未發售</h3>
<p>本埠油廠，近已盡最從事製造食油，天津及滿洲已有大批原料運抵上海。一般希望，下次授給口油之日期，即在最近之數日內。華中各地下半年度造油原料，如荳類花生紅荳等產量，至少可增百分之二十，已足夠自給。又據記者探悉，兩租界第五期戶口油，大部分雖已發售，而若干區域以手續尙未辦竣，致迄今尙未實行普售。此次截止售油期，並未確定，但希望居民從早領騰爲宜。</p>
<h3>離滬過久不歸　將取消戶口　行動仍由戶長負責</h3>
<p>公共租界中央保甲區，曾於最近在區會召開第三十次保長會議，議決要案多項。記者茲探錄其最重要者如下：（一）確切訂定戶口移動之應行辦浾：（二）申請移動戶口，須親自赴醫署辦理手續，如因特別事故，不能親自到臨時，進其派代表前往，但須由保長證明。（三）暫行回鄕離滬而示將市民證繳銷者，如經過長時期而仍未來滬，則保甲辦事處有獲取銷該居民之戶口，同時並飭其同戶戶長前往申述該居民久未回滬之原因，且該未將市民證繳銷之居民，有意外行動時，一切惟該戶長是問云。</p>
<h3>當局設法改善　蔬菜運配辦法</h3>
<p>邇日蔬菜市價高翔，攸關平民生計頗鉅，而因運輸困難，分配制度之麻煩亦爲一大因素，各菜塲由鄉間運抵此間，輾轉經過運輸商，批發商而及零售商，始售給食戶。其間彼此不取利潤，成本　必然增加。茲當局者有鑒及此，對於此點，決將設法改著，以期由鄉間運泥之各式蔬菜，即批給零售商在小菜塲出賣，其間手續又簡單，蔬菜亦新鮮，而成本亦必減輕，屆時售價當可下落。</p>

<h3>統一推進慈善事業聲中　貧病救濟協會訪問記　（五）</h3>
<p>如何扶導慈善事業？</p>
<p>貧病救濟協會是一個積極性的組織，那麼，除了愼重的補助之外，如何指導與推進慈善事業呢？協會負責人懇切　對記者說，指導二字，還說不到，不過正如我們剛綫所說的，上海有這許多慈善機關，而急待救濟的情形仍日趨嚴重，除了客觀的政治經濟諸原因以外，不能不注意到各慈善機關主觀上的弱點，特別是經費上，計劃上，管理上的弱點，我們除在經費上給與若干幫助之外。更重要的還是在乎對於計劃上管理上的協助，固然，各慈善機關的領導者，都是社會上第一等名流碩彥，但也許有不少未能切實去設計查考，我們就要去幫助他們，請專家去實地視察，研究，設計與推動改善。爲此，協會設計專門委員會（主席項康原，副主席金宗城，陳彬　），其工作範圍專就協會應辦事項，作精密計劃，以菌歸實際，款不虛糜爲目的。委員人數不定，由正副主席向協會推薦專家擔任，其設計之事項，依據救貧救病兩原則，分爲（一）管理計劃，（二）設備計劃，（三）響濟計劃，（四）工作計劃，（五）組織計劃，（六）整理計劃，（七）其他關於救濟貧病事項計劃。凡此種設計事項，得依各類分開小組會議，並擬具草案，由金體委員決議，提交協會。除了設計委會之外，依照章程，還特設顧問委員會廣聘慈善事業之前輩，社會各界之碩彥以及熱心公益之人士，集思廣益，以指導推進實際工作。</p>
<p>各方面的期望！</p>
<p>最後，記者就申報六月廿六日社評對於該會頗有期待之意，而由該會發動統一推進慈善事業，也許更能實現聞蘭亭等三才的理想吧？對於這個問題。協會負責人只從目前現狀露明，協會根據幾個月來的經騐，深深感到，在目前上海，的確有不少在嚴正的工作者，有不少慈善團體，切實是在埋頭苦幹，只不過受環境的影響，特別是經濟上的困難，大多數是在掙扎中，急待從各方面給予支持。協會成立以來，先後給予補助的慈善機關，共有四五十個單位，補助的數目，少則數千，多亦不過數萬，總數截至六月底止共爲一百五十五萬八千六百三十一元零二分，一般的說，對於每一慈善機關實際的需求，只能滿足其三分之一以一上，實際上的意義盡在刺激興奮推動，並未能完全解決各慈善機關當前的難題。這當然是限於經費，協會成立之初，原定勸募目標不過儲劵五百萬元，這個數字對於幾百個慈善機關所能補助的原極有限，而且，實際上至今還未募足，（至六月底止共爲一百九十八萬零零八十九元六角三分）這一方面是社會經濟力貧弱的影響，另一方面，如華北急振等臨時勸募，也吸收去上海大部分善款，今後要協會的事業完成，當然還有待於各界之踴躍捐助，使五百萬的基金早吿足顯，更增至千萬以上。那時方可給各慈善機關較足夠的補助，而其他推進改善工作也較易進行。就目前情形說，協會的補助極少，而因協會之存在，也許反會影響到各慈善機關原有的捐款來源，以一念之善而反結罪果，這是協會所深引爲　的，協會負責人說到這裏，眞有熱淚進流之慨，使記者感動的了不得，他還力聞一般人對於慈善事業觀察等等的錯覺，鼓勵記者去各慈善機關實地參觀，以分善惡，示國人以眞相，使慈善事業走上正軌，爲未來新社會大同世界奠定基礎。這似乎也正是記者應有的職責吧？在感奮的握手中，辭別了這位充滿正義感的協會一負責人，而協會的帶神與事業，將永遠榮繞於心目之間。（完）</p>

<p>在長長的陣列櫃上，平鋪着一幅古銅色裏心的橫披，向着署名的一邊找去，原來是曾以作「正氣歌」聞於世的文信國公手筆，筆力遒勁，瀟灑有致。從書法裏可窺看出是一們做骨嶙峋的忠臣，標價五千元，早由伍澤民君定購，但據說如有願出更高的價格者，仍可轉購。</p>
<p>此外　　板橋，仇十洲，康有爲，吳佩孚，馮國璋，譚延聞等近代名人的手筆，眞是目不暇接，美不勝收。</p>

<p>綫上是掛滿了一行行一行行的書畫屏條，塲中央又擠滿了一　　一　　的書籍，　面，攝影　，油畫照。這裏的一物一件，都是每一個人的同情心的表現。</p>
<p>當筆者跨出了會塲，踏上　途的時候，在心裏充滿了欣慰，感奮，深　得這個社會還不會到想像中的殘酷醜惡，它還有着溫暖和光明。</p>
<p>爲了救濟災難中的同胞，熱心的人們，有的在流着汗，不辭辛勞的奔走呼籲，有的拿出了他心愛的珍品，更有的出了最高的代價去競買。「互助是人類的天職」，只有廣大的人類的愛，才是人間的人類的愛，才是人間的眞愛。只有這愛，才能使人間有溫暖的感覺；只有這愛，才能使宇宙間的一切，充滿着生氣。</p>
<p>推「已飢已濁」之懷，原全上海的熱心人士，有力人士，　摥這人類同情互助的精神，踴躍的去參觀，選購。</p>

<h3>The Prospects of Sino-Japanese Economic Cooperation</h3>
<p>The Japanese economic mission has already flown back to Tokyo yesterday. This delegation came to our country as a private economic mission, and frankly discussed matters with economic figures and authorities in Beijing and Shanghai. Its accomplishments are surely immeasurable. As we bid farewell to the economic mission, we sincerely wish to further urge the Japanese delegation and those involved in Sino-Japanese economic circles to work towards the smooth development of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation and establish a solid foundation for the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere economy.</p>
<p>Although this visit to China by the Japanese economic mission was a purely private undertaking, in today's context of the Greater East Asia War and the global war situation heading towards a decisive stage, the importance of uniting the economic strengths of China and Japan to achieve victory is of extreme significance. Therefore, the importance of this mission is universally recognized by leaders in the economic circles of both countries. Our economic circles, especially, are in a state of ubiquitous illness, groaning in pain. The arrival of economic envoys from a friendly nation is seen as the arrival of economic physicians, hoping for their careful diagnosis and guidance towards treatment, so that we may alleviate our chronic ailments and promote joint cooperation with our friendly nation. Therefore, we have spared no effort in frankly stating the symptoms, causes, special circumstances, and critical crises of our country's economy, so that the mission members can understand the truth. Now that the delegation has completed its mission and returned home, we hope that they will pay close attention to the materials provided by our various sectors and the editorials of this newspaper in recent days, and give us correct instructions. Because what we have presented are symptoms, and what we expect from economic physicians are prescriptions for treating our chronic economic ailments!</p>
<p>Chief Delegate Masatsune Ogura, upon his departure yesterday, expressed his thoughts and gave some preliminary and valuable instructions. We are very grateful. Mr. Ogura said, "We are deeply willing, for the sake of enhancing war power, that government and private sectors work together, utilizing all their wisdom, to strive for Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. However, Japan has its own characteristics, and similarly, China also has its own characteristics. We deeply feel the need to utilize these characteristics." This is the premise for future Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. Otherwise, all efforts will inevitably be incompatible, and the results may even be contrary to the original intentions. After the mission returns home, it will surely remind all sectors of the friendly nation to pay attention to this point. However, the most serious problem in China's economy today lies in the chronic ailments in various aspects of the economic sphere, the stagnation of economic undertakings, and the precariousness of the national economic life. How to instruct us on methods of treatment and relief is what we eagerly hope the economic mission will strive for after returning home. It is practically impossible to cooperate with a friendly nation for a Chinese economic sector that is severely ill. In his farewell remarks, Chief Delegate Ogura mentioned, "Regarding issues such as commodity prices and currency centered in Shanghai, increased production, and food supply, they are extremely important and significant, and countermeasures must be carefully considered. Therefore, after we return to Japan, we deeply wish to consult with all parties based on the findings of this visit, and then make suggestions to the government." These words comforted us and increased our eager anticipation.</p>
<p>Chief Delegate Ogura specifically pointed out to us that, due to the national conditions and economic peculiarities of China and Japan, "when seeking to strengthen the Chinese economy and promote Chinese economic cooperation, it is truly necessary to pay full attention to the specific methods for this point," and "to know the other party's characteristics, it is difficult to understand without actually contacting local people or things." Therefore, we welcome leading figures in the Japanese economic community to come to China at any time for on-the-ground investigation and multi-faceted contact, in order to increase their understanding of the actual situation in various aspects of our country. At the same time, we must remind our countrymen that "it is impolite not to reciprocate." Following the Japanese economic mission, we should immediately send a Republic of China economic mission to return the visit to our Japanese friend. But we should also know that the economic mission to Japan is not just for the sake of etiquette, but also for practical needs. In addition to the return visit, there are at least several meanings: First, when the Japanese economic mission returns home to consult with all parties, problems may arise. We can provide firsthand information for reference, so that future Sino-Japanese economic cooperation will be more foolproof; Second, to observe the wartime economic facilities of our friendly nation, so as to determine the direction and content of our country's economic cooperation with Japan, in order to avoid repetition, triviality, and other regrets, and to serve as a reference for our country's economic recovery. Therefore, we must dispatch an economic return visit mission to Japan, and we must make sufficient preparations beforehand, so as not to have no practical benefit other than ceremonial etiquette.</p>
<p>China and Japan have the closest relationship in the Greater East Asia War today, and even in the future peace, they have the friendship of close brothers. The mutual dependence of the economies of China and Japan is almost inevitable. From China's point of view, without a Japan that is economically superior in the world, it is inevitable to be in danger of being exploited by European and American powers; but from Japan's perspective, if East Asia does not have a China that can independently develop economically and is becoming increasingly prosperous, then Japan will inevitably feel a sense of vulnerability regarding its position in the world. We hope that in today's and future Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, this basic principle must first be grasped, and then the two countries can support each other like hands and feet, exchange what they have for what they need, and help each other develop. To this end, we further hope to increase the close contact between the economic circles of the two countries, and gradually establish a regular conference of a private nature in the economic circles of the two countries through frequent exchanges, in order to promote the cooperative enterprise of economic cooperation between the two countries. This is what we sincerely hope for.</p>
<h3>Wang Kemin Went to Beijing for Instructions; Returned to Beijing After Completing Official Business Yesterday; The Central Government's Instructions on Policy Guidelines Were Detailed; Further Progress Will Be Made in General Administration in North China</h3>
<p>Beijing, 18th (Central News Agency) - Wang Kemin, Chairman of the North China Government Affairs Commission of the National Government, went to Nanjing a few days ago to report to Chairman Wang about his assumption of office and to seek instructions.

Officials and civilians in North China have great expectations for Wang's visit to Beijing for instructions. It is believed that at this time of strengthening the wartime system, the central authorities will give detailed instructions on general administrative measures in North China. Therefore, after Wang's return, the situation in the North will surely develop further, and the establishment of security, improvement of people's livelihood, and increase in production will all have leaps and bounds.

<h3>Diverting the Yellow River into the Wei River; Construction to Begin on August 1st; The Entire Project to Be Undertaken by the Henan Provincial Government</h3>
<p>Kaifeng, 18th (Central News Agency) - Regarding the issue of diverting the Yellow River into the Wei River, the General Construction Office sent a survey team to conduct a detailed investigation. It has now been decided to entrust the entire construction of the diversion canal to the Henan Provincial Government, and construction will begin on August 1st. The entire project will employ 1,200 workers. The opening method is based on accurate measurements, showing that the terrain in the Wuzhi-Xinxiang area of the Yellow River slopes slightly from southwest to northeast, directly to the left bank of the Wei River. It is expected that by May of next year, the entire irrigation area can be completed. On the west bank of the diversion canal, only the Xinxiang area can irrigate 80,000 mu of land. On the east bank, the Xinxiang and Yanjin areas can irrigate 210,000 mu of land. Wheat can be irrigated at will for four months each year, including March, May, September, and November, and it can also be used for irrigation and pest control in May and June. At the same time, the soil quality in Yanjin, Yangwu, Xinxiang and other counties will be improved. The sandy hills can be completely flushed away after the completion of this canal. In addition, in terms of water conservancy, the injection of Yellow River water into the Wei River will ensure smooth navigation in the inland areas of Hebei and Shandong provinces, both upstream and downstream. Regarding the New Yellow River, based on the dredging of the diversion canal, the downstream passage of the New Yellow River through Taikang and more than ten counties in eastern Henan can also reduce the flooding disasters that have been feared for years.</p>
<p>Beiping, 18th (Central News Agency) - In order to ensure that there is no flooding in Jinan this year, the General Construction Office of the North China Political Affairs Commission has provided a subsidy of 450,000 yuan to dredge the Daqing River and repair the rivers and dikes around Jinan City.</p>

<h3>Friction Between Chongqing and the Communists Intensifies</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency) - Since the dissolution of the Third International by the Soviet Union, the Chongqing side has deeply felt that adjusting relations with the Chinese Communists is an important issue at hand. They are now plotting to suppress the power of the Chinese Communists. Hu Zongnan, "Commander of the 34th Group Army" in Chongqing, has been stationed in the northern Shaanxi area since May under the orders of Chiang Kai-shek, completing the encirclement of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. Zhang Xiaofei, of the CC Clique, has also received secret orders from Chiang Kai-shek to convene representatives of cultural relations in Xi'an, resolving to disband the Chinese Communists and sending a telegram to Mao Zedong expressing their attitude. The Chinese Communist side is extremely dissatisfied with this approach by the Chongqing side. Zhu De, Mao Zedong, and others have jointly sent a telegram to Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan, lodging a serious protest. This dispute between Chongqing and the Communists is different from the past. The Chinese Communist Party itself has been weakened due to the dissolution of the Third International by the Soviet Union. Therefore, the Chongqing side is criticizing the Communist Party's mouthpiece extremely fiercely. On the 13th of this month, the Chinese Communist Party's newspaper "Liberation Daily" criticized the Chongqing Kuomintang, saying, "Recently, strange events have occurred within the anti-Japanese camp, that is, the majority of the Chongqing Kuomintang leaders have united their military newspapers to jointly exclude the Chinese Communist Party. Recently, the Chongqing side has even mobilized all the armies under the 'Eighth War Zone' to encircle the Northwest Border Region. This kind of action is truly inappropriate. On July 6th, the Chongqing Central News Agency announced that all agencies in Xi'an had decided to disband the Central Committee, and on June 12th, Zhang Xiaofei again bought the 'Xi'an Document' to make the same decision, which we cannot tolerate. We have protested to the 'Central Propaganda Department' in Chongqing regarding the Chongqing military's move to the border region and have requested Chiang Kai-shek to handle it properly."</p>

<h3>Japanese Warriors on the Burmese Front Overcome Torrential Rains, Mud, Snakes, and Epidemics</h3>
<p>The Japanese front-line positions on the Burmese-Indian border, the area with the highest rainfall in the world, are struggling day and night against the violence of nature, "General Rainy Season." The morale of the Japanese front-line soldiers facing India on the Arakan Mountains is like an arrow ready to strike. In the highlands of the northern Burmese-Indian border, soldiers must not only resist attacks from the , but also endure torrential rains, mud, snakes, and epidemics. When we come into contact with the indescribable hardships of the front-line soldiers, a sense of loyalty arises spontaneously.</p>
<p>Driving on Dangerous Roads</p>
<p>The rainy season began in this area in early June. Unlike the rainy season in Lower Burma, the rain falls like a waterfall. Bridges and tunnels that had previously been built during the march were washed away by the torrential rain. The roads were muddy and impassable, and marching often became impossible. was most lacking among the . Recently, they have been relying only on dried wild vegetables to survive. When they occasionally eat the mountain potatoes that are sent, the soldiers look at each other and smile wryly.</p>
<p>Beef Falling from the Sky</p>
<p>However, even in the remote areas, they receive Churchill's reward, which is the meat of cows bombed by enemy planes indiscriminately. After the enemy planes leave, the soldiers thank the sky for the snakes and scorpions, the most annoying things. are famous in Burma. They hide in washbasins and military boots, causing the army a great headache. Also, terrifying snakes over ten feet long often crawl onto the tents, waking the soldiers. At the grave of a certain captain who was killed in the final assault after several bayonet charges to occupy a certain new battlefield on May 24th, there is a flower similar to a cosmos. The soldiers looking at the when they see the artillery of a certain commander, they occasionally see a British officer with a ghastly complexion appearing outside the tent, as if he were right in front of them.</p>
<p>The Tragedy of Arakan</p>
<p>As for the southern border, the soldiers who defeated the fleeing enemy in the previous great battle, ending the "Tragedy of Arakan" by enemy which called to return to Burma, have set up a solid front line to await future battles. The hardships of the soldiers in this area are also beyond our imagination. Only well-trained, Japanese soldiers, who are renowned for their , can endure them.</p>
<p>Sleeping in Wet Clothes in the Cold Rain</p>
<p>In the front-line positions, soldiers are sleeping in tents in the forest, and their pillows are soaked by the cold and sad night rain. Affairs cannot be done at will. Due to insufficient supplies, the soldiers often catch wild animals and roast them for food.</p>
<p>The hardships of the rear units are no less than those of the front-line units. For example, the transportation units have to carry the heavy burden of transportation through muddy, knee-deep roads. The treacherousness of the Arakan Mountains is like the difficulty of the road. There are countless dangerous cliffs and precipices. However, if they do not pass through those dangerous roads day and night to transport supplies, the front-line positions would be in danger of becoming . The soldiers disregard diseases and other things, overcome all difficulties day by day, ignite the spirit of combat, and move towards destroying the enemy. (Translated from a special dispatch from the Burmese border of the Western Asahi Shimbun on July 11)</p>

This week, it will conduct a more detailed investigation, and the information obtained will be submitted to the investigation team for detailed review in order to wipe out hoarders who manipulate prices. According to related sources, the scope of the committee's investigation of materials will be expanded from commercial warehouses under the jurisdiction of the Public Works Department to warehouses and stockpiles throughout Shanghai, or even to inspect private houses. It is also reported that in order to achieve greater effectiveness, the committee will implement a reward system for those who report hoarders.</p>
<h3>China Tobacco Distribution Association Intensifies Supervision; Effective Measures Will Be Taken for Sanctions</h3>
<p>In view of the increasingly rampant black market for cigarettes, the China Tobacco Distribution Association has specially stipulated effective sanction measures to prevent black market resale and profiteering, and has issued a circular to all wholesalers and retailers to comply with them: (1) Tobacco must be sold at the prescribed price. (2) The cigarettes distributed must be sold evenly every ten days. (3) No hoarding or refusal to sell is allowed. (4) All cigarettes must be sold with the seal broken. (5) Children are not allowed to purchase. (6) Each person is limited to one pack per purchase. At the same time, supervisors are specially dispatched to thoroughly check the account books of various sales agencies. Those who violate the above regulations will be deemed to have participated in black market transactions and will be severely punished in addition to having their distribution cards revoked. Currently, black market transactions are entirely caused by speculators, and black market prices exceed the limited price by almost double. Therefore, general smokers find it difficult to purchase cigarettes. It is reported that the association has received reports, so the supervision work has been intensified in recent days, and several sales agencies suspected of violations have been temporarily suspended from distribution. At the same time, some Class A and Class B cards that have been found to be unqualified have been downgraded. For those agencies that applied for registration before May 1st but have not yet received distribution, they will be investigated and rated separately in order to issue cards and distribute goods. In addition, negotiations are being held with relevant authorities to crack down on the black market for cigarettes in Caohejing and Ningbo Road.</p>
<h3>Hua Zhong Bean Increase in Production; Edible Oil Can Be Self-Sufficient; Some of the Allotted Oil Has Not Been Sold</h3>
<p>Oil factories in this port have recently been doing their best to manufacture edible oil, and a large number of raw materials from Tianjin and Manchuria have arrived in Shanghai. It is generally hoped that the date for the next allocation of oil will be in the next few days. The output of oil-producing raw materials such as beans, peanuts, and red beans in various parts of Central China in the second half of the year can be increased by at least 20%, which is sufficient for self-sufficiency. According to reporters, although most of the fifth round of household oil in the two concessions has been sold, some areas have not yet implemented universal sales due to unfinished procedures. The deadline for selling oil has not yet been determined, but it is hoped that residents will collect it as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Leaving Shanghai for Too Long Without Returning - Account Will Be Canceled; Actions Still the Responsibility of the Head of Household</h3>
<p>The Central Baojia District of the Public Concession recently held its 30th Bao Chief meeting at the district council, resolving several important cases. The reporter now explores the most important of these as follows: (1) Definitively establishing procedures for household registration relocation; (2) Applying to relocate a household registration requires personally going to the medical office to complete the procedures. If, due to special circumstances, it is impossible to go in person, a representative may be sent, but it must be certified by the Bao Chief; (3) Residents who temporarily return to their hometown and leave Shanghai without surrendering their Citizen Certificates, if a long period passes and they still do not return to Shanghai, the Baojia office has the right to cancel the resident's household registration, and at the same time, order the head of household of the same household to explain the reason why the resident has not returned to Shanghai for a long time. Furthermore, in the event of unexpected actions by the resident who did not surrender their Citizen Certificate, the head of household will be held fully responsible.</p>
<h3>Authorities Devise Methods to Improve Vegetable Transportation and Distribution</h3>
<p>Recently, vegetable market prices have soared, greatly impacting the livelihoods of ordinary people. Difficulties in transportation and the cumbersome distribution system are also major factors. Various vegetable fields are transported from the countryside to this area, passing through transporters, wholesalers, and retailers before being sold to households. In the process, costs inevitably increase as each party takes profits. Considering this, the authorities have decided to find ways to reform and aim to have various vegetables transported from the countryside directly supplied to retailers for sale in small vegetable markets. This simplifies procedures, keeps the vegetables fresh, and inevitably reduces costs, at which time the selling price should fall.</p>
<h3>Assisting in the Capture of Thieves, Completing the Mission - Self-Defense Corps Member Dies in the Line of Duty - Fang Jiuxia Silver Shop on Nanjing Road Robbed - Thief Refuses Arrest, Opens Fire, Killing Two</h3>
<p>Around 12:30 pm yesterday, a customer came to the Fang Jiuxia Silver Shop on East Nanjing Road and Shiliu Road to select a diamond ring from the shop assistant. The shop assistant presented three diamond styles (worth about 10,000 Chinese currency). The customer stood at the entrance of the silver shop, pretending to choose, and then put the diamond ring into his coat pocket, stepped out of the door, crossed Nanjing Road, and fled north along the road. He turned west into a small road at the entrance of Fujian Road, where a patrolling Indian policeman, Terli Pu Xin (transliteration), number 545, blocked his path. The thief fired two shots, hitting the policeman in the abdomen. The policeman was seriously injured and fell to the ground. The thief then crossed Fujian Road, turned northwest into Defen Lane, where a pedestrian named Jiang E (transportation worker) heard the pursuit and attempted to intercept him. The thief saw this and fired again, killing him on the spot. He fled north, turned into Tianjin Road, and fled east. At that time, Shen Heqing, the squad leader of the 20th Jia of the 4th Lianbao of the Laoza District Self-Defense Corps (44 years old, from Yuyao, Zhejiang, and a tea worker foreman of the Coal Industry Association), heard the alarm and came forward. At the entrance of number 363, he bravely hugged the thief from behind. The thief refused arrest and shot Shen in the left chest. The two fell to the ground. At that moment, members of the nearby Self-Defense Corps and police arrived and captured the thief. Shen was sent to Renji Hospital by ambulance, where he died of his injuries at 1:30 pm that afternoon. The arrested suspect was identified as Huang Cifu (33 years old, from Suzhou, residing at No. 45, Lane 362, Matthew Hess Road). He will be brought to court today for public prosecution.</p>

<p>Donating Funds to Help Students is a Proactive Act of Charity</p>
<h3>In the Midst of the Unified Promotion of Charitable Causes - An Interview with the Association for the Relief of the Poor and Sick (5)</h3>
<p>How to Guide and Promote Charitable Undertakings?</p>
<p>The Association for the Relief of the Poor and Sick is a proactive organization. So, in addition to careful subsidies, how does it guide and promote charitable undertakings? The person in charge of the Association sincerely said to the reporter, "The word 'guide' is still too much to say. However, as we just mentioned, there are so many charitable organizations in Shanghai, and the situation of those in urgent need of relief is still becoming more serious. In addition to objective political and economic reasons, we cannot fail to notice the subjective weaknesses of various charitable organizations, especially in terms of funding, planning, and management. In addition to providing some financial assistance, more importantly, we assist in planning and management. Of course, the leaders of various charitable organizations are all first-class celebrities and scholars in society, but perhaps many have not been able to effectively design and investigate. We will help them, invite experts to conduct on-site inspections, research, design, and promote improvements. To this end, the Association has designed a special committee (Chairman Xiang Kangyuan, Vice Chairman Jin Zongcheng, Chen Bin), whose scope of work is specifically to make precise plans for the matters that the Association should handle, with the goal of being practical and not wasting funds. The number of committee members is not fixed, and experts are recommended to the Association by the chairman and vice-chairman. The design matters are divided into (1) management plan, (2) equipment plan, (3) relief plan, (4) work plan, (5) organizational plan, (6) rectification plan, and (7) other plans related to the relief of the poor and sick, based on the two principles of poverty relief and disease relief. All such design matters can be divided into small group meetings according to various categories, and draft proposals can be formulated for the decision of the Jin body committee and submitted to the Association. In addition to the design committee, in accordance with the regulations, an advisory committee is specially set up to widely invite predecessors in charitable undertakings, scholars from all walks of life, and people who are enthusiastic about public welfare, to gather ideas and guide the promotion of practical work.</p>
<p>Expectations from All Sides!</p>
<p>Finally, the reporter asked about the "Shen Bao's" June 26th editorial, which had high expectations for the association, and whether the association's initiation of a unified promotion of charitable undertakings might better realize the ideals of Wen Lanting and other talents. Regarding this question, the person in charge of the association only revealed from the current situation that the association, based on several months of experience, deeply felt that there were indeed many people working seriously in Shanghai, and there were many charitable organizations that were indeed working hard, but under the influence of the environment, especially economic difficulties, most were struggling and urgently needed support from all sides. Since its establishment, the Association has provided subsidies to a total of forty or fifty charitable organizations, with subsidies ranging from several thousand to no more than tens of thousands, totaling 1,558,631 yuan and 02 fen as of the end of June. Generally speaking, for the actual needs of each charitable organization, it can only meet one-third or more of its needs, and the practical significance is only to stimulate and promote excitement, and cannot completely solve the current difficulties of various charitable organizations. This is of course limited by funding. At the beginning of its establishment, the Association originally set a fundraising target of only 5 million reserve coupons. This figure is extremely limited for the subsidies that can be given to hundreds of charitable organizations. Moreover, in reality, it has not yet been fully raised (totaling 1,980,089 yuan and 6 jiao as of the end of June). On the one hand, this is due to the impact of weak social economic power, and on the other hand, temporary fundraising such as urgent relief in North China has also absorbed most of the donations in Shanghai. In the future, if the Association's work is to be completed, it will of course depend on the enthusiastic donations of all circles, so that the 5 million fund can be declared sufficient as early as possible and further increased to more than 10 million. Only then can more adequate subsidies be given to various charitable organizations, and other promotion and improvement work will be easier to carry out. As far as the current situation is concerned, the Association's subsidies are very small, and because of the Association's existence, it may affect the original source of donations for various charitable organizations. It is deeply regrettable that good intentions may lead to bad results. The person in charge of the association said that there were tears in his eyes, which moved the reporter very much. He also strongly criticized the general public's misconceptions about observing charitable undertakings, and encouraged reporters to visit various charitable organizations on the ground to distinguish good from bad, show the truth to the people, and put charitable undertakings on the right track, laying the foundation for a great harmonious world in the new society of the future. This also seems to be the responsibility of the reporter, right? In a handshake of inspiration, I bid farewell to this responsible person of the association, who was full of righteousness, and the spirit and cause of the association will forever surround my heart.

<h3>Fishing Strictly Prohibited at the Nine-Bend Bridge of the Town God's Temple</h3>
<p>The pond at the Nine-Bend Bridge of the Town God's Temple in the Nanshi area is one of Shanghai's famous scenic spots, with green water and clear waves, and fish can be counted. Recently, nearby citizens have been competing to fish in the river, catching the pond fish. Most of the fish in the pond are released by the citizens of the Southern District. Fishing and harming the fish is a violation of the purpose of release, and it also damages the scenic area. Therefore, the local Town God's Temple Fan Yong Branch issued a strict order yesterday prohibiting fishing, and violators will be severely punished.</p>

<h3>North China Urgent Relief - Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition - Extended for Two Days - Enthusiastic Bidding from All Walks of Life</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the seventh day of the "North China Urgent Relief - Calligraphy and Painting Charity Exhibition" hosted by this newspaper. Although the weather was bad, visitors continued to come in an endless stream. Many gentlemen and ladies from friendly countries such as Japan and Germany also participated in the exhibition that day. It was originally scheduled to end yesterday, but at the request of people from all walks of life, it was decided to extend it for two more days, until tomorrow. General Wu Peifu's posthumous work exhibited by this association received a telegram from Mr. Wu yesterday, willing to bid 6,000 yuan to purchase it, but if anyone is willing to bid a higher price, they can still transfer the purchase. Many vertical scrolls and fan surfaces were sold yesterday, and at the same time, many people continued to donate collections, and their enthusiasm for charity is admirable. Based on this, starting today, all items will be priced at a 30% discount, and it is hoped that ladies and gentlemen who love art will purchase more to contribute to the charity.</p>
<h3>A Tour of the North China Urgent Relief Calligraphy and Painting Charity Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Yu Xiuru</p>
<p>The "North China Urgent Relief Calligraphy and Painting Charity Exhibition" hosted by the "Shen Bao" was held on the fourth floor of the old site of the HSBC Bank on the Bund—today's Xingya Building. I walked into that magnificent building with enthusiasm to make a hasty tour.</p>
<p>What impressed me the most was that the love of human compassion was fully developed here. Many works of calligraphy and painting and antiques donated by many enthusiastic people were neatly displayed in the spacious and bright hall.</p>
<p>At the top of the hall in the center, two vertical scrolls were hung side by side. Looking closely, they were the left and right calligraphy of the National Father. The brushwork was vigorous and the font was dignified. One was a regular script "Physical Education Harmony," ah! The valuable national treasure of the great man, priced at 100,000 yuan, I don't think it's too much. Next to it was President Wang's running script vertical scroll, with clear brushstrokes and elegant fonts, priced at only 10,000 yuan. Under the two vertical scrolls, leaning against it was a four-foot-high oil painting photo entitled "Snow," a masterpiece by Liu Haisu, priced at 30,000 yuan.</p>
<p>On the long array of cabinets, a horizontal scroll with an antique bronze-colored lining was laid flat. Looking for the side with the signature, it turned out to be the handwriting of Wen Tianguan, Duke of Xin Guo, who was known to the world for writing "Song of Righteousness." The brushwork was strong and vigorous, and the calligraphy revealed a loyal minister with distinct bones. Priced at 5,000 yuan, it was already ordered by Mr. Wu Zemin, but it is said that if anyone is willing to bid a higher price, they can still transfer the purchase.</p>
<p>In addition, the handwriting of modern celebrities such as Zheng Banqiao, Qiu Shizhou, Kang Youwei, Wu Peifu, Feng Guozhang, and Tan Yankai was really dazzling and breathtaking.</p>
<p>On a stage in the hall, many antiques and jades were displayed. Here are all kinds of world treasures and exquisite carved Buddha statues. Every visitor was carefully watching them.</p>
<p>The wires were hung with rows and rows of calligraphy and painting screens, and the center of the hall was crowded with books, prints, photographs, and oil painting photos. Every item here is an expression of everyone's sympathy.</p>
<p>When the reporter stepped out of the hall and embarked on the journey, his heart was filled with relief and inspiration. He deeply felt that this society would not be as cruel and ugly as imagined. It still has warmth and light.</p>
<p>In order to help the compatriots in the disaster, enthusiastic people are sweating and working tirelessly to run around and appeal, some have taken out their beloved treasures, and some have bid the highest price to buy them. "Mutual assistance is the duty of mankind." Only the love of the vast human race is the true love of mankind. Only this love can make people feel warm; only this love can make everything in the universe full of life.</p>
<p>Extending the feelings of "being hungry and turbid," I hope that all enthusiastic and powerful people in Shanghai will promote this spirit of human compassion and mutual assistance and actively visit and purchase.</p>

<h3>After the Unified Purchase and Distribution of Cotton, Yarn Factories Prepare to Resume Work</h3>
<p>The Cotton Industry Special Committee of the Commercial and Economic Coordination Council decided to uniformly purchase and centrally distribute cotton in various regions of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui this year. In the future, the cotton raw materials needed by Japanese, Chinese, and military-managed yarn factories will be distributed by the committee based on the equipment and production situation of each factory. Shanghai News Agency reporters learned from the textile industry yesterday: (1) The number of spindles in military and commercial yarn factories before the war was 1,114,408, and now it is 1,395,664, an increase of 281,256. The number of looms before the war was 8,754, and now it is 10,965, an increase of 2,211. (2) The number of spindles in Japanese-owned factories before the war was 1,331,412, and now it is 1,105,364, a decrease of 226,048. The number of looms before the war was 17,283, and now it is 16,675, a decrease of 608. (3) The number of spindles in British-owned factories before the war was 221,336, and now it is 207,000, a decrease of 14,336. The number of looms before the war was 4,021, and now it is 3,686, a decrease of 335. As for the actual operating conditions of each factory, the output of yarn spindles and looms has been generally reduced due to raw materials. It is said that because the unified method for the purchase and distribution of cotton has been determined, each yarn factory will inevitably try to gradually restore and increase the production of spindles and looms that had been reduced in the past after the new cotton is put on the market this year to meet the legitimate needs of the war.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Market Financial, Industrial, and Commercial Conditions Last Week</h3>
<p>Shanghai market financial, industrial, and commercial conditions last week were affected by various unfounded rumors that stirred up people's hearts and speculators who still wanted to revive their old ways and secretly engaged in hoarding and manipulation, resulting in chaotic situations. Whether it was pure silver, stocks, rice, silk, cloth, or various daily necessities, all soared in price. Especially on Thursday, the rising trend was even more severe. Immediately, the relevant authorities strictly prohibited speculation and secretly dispatched cadres to investigate and detain unscrupulous merchants who hoarded, speculated, and disrupted the market. On Saturday, the market showed a sharp decline, and various market prices gradually returned to stability. The market prices officially determined by a certain authority remained unchanged.</p>

<p>Jingfu Machine Factory Builds New Factory</p>
<p>Jingfu Shirt and Sock Weaving Factory was established in the autumn of last year with a capital of 15 million yuan, with Xu Wenzhao as the chairman and general manager and Xu Chongqing as the manager and factory director. Because the business has been thriving since last year, the original factory buildings are not enough for application. Therefore, a new factory is planned to be built at No. 990 Xujiahui Road. Recently, it has been approved by the French authorities. The factory has now entrusted Xinyi Real Estate Company to act as an agent for soliciting investment. It is said that the factory building part will cost about 8 million yuan.</p>
