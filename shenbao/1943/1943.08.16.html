<p>社評</p>
<h3>新生上海之建設與整飭吏治</h3>
<p>上海租界接收之時，市民鼓舞歡騰頗極一時之盛。是乃市民對於新上海之誕生抱着無限慶幸之表示。此後官方民間絡續發表意見，雖以立塲之不同而觀察或異，要皆對於新上海之將來，抱着無限希望之表示。因此關於新生上海之建設，値得加以反復硏討而不厭求詳，務使此呱呱墮地之嬰兒，扶養發育，以副市民及各方面之期望。本報曾就民意機構與簡選人材，先後論列，所以不憚煩者，原因在此。茲更以整飭吏治加以申論。</p>
<p>在最近兩世紀中，中國吏治之風氣，可謂江河日下。誤國誤民之處，例不勝舉，事實俱在，無可諱言。且租界之產生，亦即根由於吏治之腐敗，此後復容其僭竊跋　又誰之過，養　遺患前車可鑒。此固就滬言滬，正復可例其他。當國府還都之初，本是革新吏治之機會，奈當時創導新頴之國　，收拾破碎之局面，容或有不得不遷就姑息之苦衷，至不能達理想之境地。但茲新上海之誕生，民衆擁護，機構齊備，正可從容不迫，從事於澈首澈尾之刷新，定一勞永逸之大計。癸上海在政治·經濟·社會任何方面，素有左右全國之影響作用，故其吏治之良窳，亦不僅影響於新生上海之建設，抑將關繫全國之命運。願於此與民更始之際，提綱　領，闡述整飭吏治之要議與方法於后：</p>
<p>（甲）要義　「民為貴，社稷次之，君為輕。」這是一句古諺，似乎不合於今日。若譯以現時的詞句，即為『老百姓第一，政府次之，長官為輕。』枚舉其意義至為明顯而且顚撲不破。因為少數長官之利未必是政府之利，更未必是老百姓之利。反而言之，有利於老百姓者必有利於政府，而長官亦蒙其庥。試觀一般稅政，表面上莫不主張委辦制度，而實際上依然是包辦性質。政府機關固可不費征收稽核之勞，按時入其應得之數，但承包之人本多唯利是圖，繳納而有餘，則層層報効。中飽無　，遂進而巧立名目，旣　目苛。直接增加市民之負担，間接妨碍百業之發展，結果則民生凋敝而府庫未充，此乃重君輕民之一例。反觀吏治　明之國家，志在優裕愈大，創始之困難愈多，一般人民每無雄厚之資力，任此艱鉅，而裹足不前。故當發軔之初，必由政府醵資倡導，藉政治之力量，打破初步之難關。迨基礎鞏固，然後取回相當成本，讓諸民營，加以正當之監督。以其所入，再如法發動其他之企之監督。以其所入，再如法發動其他之企業，循環演進，百廢俱興，國富民强實非偶然之事。此乃重民輕君之一例。百姓足君孰與不足，四海困窮天祿永終。以『民為貴』為信條，　刷吏治之精神，此為第一要義。吏之於民，猶父之於子，愛之以恩義，律之以準繩，故家有家規，國有國法，勸善懲惡，維繫不　。然法之所在，規避隨之。狡黠之輩，必施展其鬼祟之技倆，以達其非法之目的。先之以蒙蔽，繼之以營求，至官吏之弱點在握，遂可予取予求而肆無忌憚。甚或上下其手，官官相護，知法犯法，旁若無人。竊鈎者誅，竊國者侯，官家無妨縱火，百姓不得燃燈。皇皇明令，在政府本身已視為具文。上有好者下必尤甚，以致作奸犯科，官商互為靑裏。法令適為壟斷居奇之工具，與民爭利之護符，夫復何言。往日租界各自為政，對於當地民情容或有所隔瘼，每逢平價之令出，物價必隨之而漲，現象之怪，莫此為甚。自今政權完整之後，務　為政不在多言，言出必行之訓，樹立吏治之威信，此為第二要義。</p>
<p>（乙）方法　要義雖僅寥寥二則，而欲實行整飭吏治之方法，却又千頭萬緖，姑不作迂闊之談，僅及切要之點：　所有政策政綱，須經過冷靜之考慮，然後抱貫澈之決心。若恃須臾之衝動，逞快一時，必感難以為繼。　節約須從官吏始。不儉無以　　，不廉乃至無恥，無恥且不足以為人，更不堪任治人之吏。上海本繁華之市，尤宜　　。　以往租界為特殊地區，亦即萬惡之藪，此後市內居民固為一體，官吏亦一視同仁。懸明　之　的，為考績之標準，無　無黨，賞罰　明。知法犯法者罪加一等，濫竽充數者立加更換。必有健全之人選，方能與辦健全之事業。　上海近來為各地各機關辦事處集中之所，是否各有其必要，姑不在此詳論。惟其如此，必須處之以敦陸，而權限劃分，各有其本位。上海本身之組織已　大錯綜，更不能以無謂之　　而減低其效能。其他如長官應如何以身作則，公務人員之俸給應如何提高等，不　列舉。</p>
<p>民意上　，人材優秀，吏治整　，三者備而上海治，全國景縱，風氣不亦，方能發揮力量，共衛東亞，自由獨立之幸福，永享無極。</p>
<h3>所羅門羣島方面　日空軍收穫戰果　敵運輸船三艘被擊沉</h3>
<p>東京十五日中央社電　日大本營十五日下午三時發表：日　軍航空部隊攻擊龍加方面海峽（在瓜　爾卡納爾島北方）及掃蕩倫物巴島方面敵機，擊沉其大型運輸船三艘，日機並調派另一　　襲擊敵飛機塲，炸毀及焚燒其機塲各一。　攻擊倫特巴方面之日戰鬥機隊。在孟達上空　敵戰鬥機十架交戰，擊落共六架，是役日機喪失一架。</p>
<p>里斯本十五日中央社電　麥克活塞將軍之司令部今日宣稱：日機大編隊於十三日夜間空襲所羅門羣島之基里維那島，又稱，日機另一大編隊曾猛炸近百洛柯附近之其挨他之敵軍陣地。</p>
<h3>各地軍糧民食　糧部已有準備　糧部周次長發表談話</h3>
<p>南京十五日中央社電　糧食部周次長對記者發表談話如下：</p>
<p>物價的　　、本以成本需求和供應情形為原子，現値大東亞民族解放全面戰爭的時代，物價自不能與平時相提並論，或因人工與原料的關係，成本加重，或因　量與運輸的問題，供應不能圓滑，而使物價高翔。此係勢所難免的。然而現在的物價上漲，漫無標準，任　高抬，一日之　，漲上四五成，毫無足異，其非單純的因為成本之加重與供求之不能　　。而為奸商投機團積之所致，至為明顯。　統制物資，制止投機囤積，實為　事時期安定民生之必要措置，糧食為人民生命所需，較之其他物質，尤關重要，政府　見及此，實施統制，迄已三年，積水地商民，均能了解編制意義及辦法，對於糧食之投機囤積，雖尙未臻　跡，但尙不致如瘋如狂，　行無忌。兼以本部對於糧食缺乏之都市，普遍配給，當地雖有黑市，亦不過曇花一現，不能久持。故在此見狂雨驟　起　落物價漲落反常　時，而米尙能相當安定，實景最可欣幸的事。</p>
<p>現新穀大批登塲，已在目前，靑黃不接時期，所需各地軍糧民食，本部早有充分準備，可無憂慮，是可吿慰於各地民衆。希望民衆信任政府，勿事恐慌，不獨囤積居奇，千犯法令，為政府所不許，須受法律的制裁，即個人家族所需，亦不宜囤積，以往一般人民，因受物價刺激，並恐慌斗米亦將隨物價上漲，爭相私買存　，其一人所購數量雖屬微小，然購存的人多，則數量亦累積而成鉅大，供需不均，米價亦可形成高漲與一般物價同趨一致。此種情形，希望人民自加糾正，則米價之長期穩定，自可不成問題。</p>
<h3>羅馬宣布為　不設防城市　反軸心國提先決條件　該城不得含軍事作用</h3>
<p>羅馬十五日中央社電　斯蒂芬尼社本日宣稱：義大利政府，已經由敎廷通知關係各國，謂已決定自七月三十一日　。宣布羅馬為不設防城市，並欲獲知在如何之環境後，此議可蒙接納云。羅馬為天主敎之中心地，因屢遭突襲，故義政府不再　延，正式公開宣布，羅馬為不設防城市，並採取　要措施，以求符合於國際公法。</p>
<p>里斯本十五日中央社電　據路透社倫敦消息：官方昨日宣佈對義大利宣佈羅馬為不　防城市，英政府之態度，不受影響，義國單方面之宣告，當不能影響反軸心國總司令之自由行動云。</p>
<p>里斯本十五日中央社電　據海通社訊：奎貝克消息靈通人士，昨夜指出反軸心靈通人士，昨夜指出反軸心國已在原則上同意義政府所宣佈羅馬為不　防城市，惟先決條件，乃義政府必須提出絕對證據，證明羅馬此後將不復有任何軍事目的之作用。</p>
<p>羅馬被炸死傷七百</p>
<p>羅馬十五日中央社電　義軍司令部十四日公布載報：反軸心空襲，於十三日轟炸羅馬，結果市民死者二百十八人，傷者五百六十人，又轟炸特爾尼時死三百四人，傷者五百三十人。</p>
<h3>榮子恆將晋京　謁主席請示</h3>
<p>濟南十五日中央社電　榮子恆將軍　部參加和運後，即從事整飭所屬，鞏固防務，茲以一切均待向中樞當局請示，已定於日內由濟南來京，恭謁主席致敬，並請示機宜。</p>
<h3>蘇北縣長會議　定期舉行</h3>
<p>蘇省十五日中央社電　江蘇省政府為討公安生產保甲及財務敎育等項問題起見，定於八月二十二日上午九時，在省府召開蘇北各縣縣長會議。茲悉會議綱領及日程已由政務應辦理就緖，並已指定大會　　　職員，出席者，（一）省長，（二）各廳　局長，（三）參事，（四）第一區行政督察專員，（五）蘇北地區淸鄕主任，（六）各縣縣長特區署長，列席者，（一）省黨部，（二）淸鄕地區黨務指導處，（三）各廳處局秘書主任，（四）政　廳各科科長，大會秘書長由政務廳長担任。</p>
<h3>渝方軍費困窘　强制交納</h3>
<p>廣東十五日中央社電　據渝電，渝方近因軍費困窘，曾呼籲舉行慰問軍隊運動，及募集士兵金等，但迄無成效，淪方計無所出，故最近擬公布强制辦法，分派各省負担，勒令交納，因此益引起民衆之反感與非難。由此可見渝方財政之窮困，即軍費亦已無法維持，同時更可反映在渝方橫征暴歛下之民衆，對於所謂「抗戰」已　衷心厭棄之心理矣</p>
<h3>陳大使返任</h3>
<p>南京十五日中央社電　我國駐滿大使陳濟成氏日前返國，曾恭　　主席述職後，因公赴滬，茲已在滬公　，於十四日返京，並已於十五日下午四時乘津浦車北上轉道赴滿返任。</p>

<h3>日大使授贈　德要人勳章</h3>
<p>柏林十五日中央社電　日駐德大使大島氏，於十五日代表日政府授贈勳章與德方諸要人，並發表簡單演詞稱：余確信我人已抱決心，即使發生任何事態，在未擊滅敵人前，決繼續戰爭到底，日德兩國必須密切提携，與共同之敵作戰。</p>
<h3>新國民運動綱要</h3>
<p>— 汪精衛</p>
<p>在新國民運動公務人員及靑少年　暑期集訓營講授新國民運動綱要，第一屆及第二屆均分三次講授，每次約一小時半，講授的大意是相同的，所不相同祇是觸類引申，詳　反覆，如今刪其　，節其要，寫成此稿，以備諸生檢閱。　精衛自識</p>
<p>第二講大意</p>
<p>第一講所說是發起新國民運動的由來，詳言之，則新國民運動之發起，在　我們認識新時代之使命，培養其責任能力，以能担負起新時代之使命。</p>
<p>然則新國民運動將以何者為內容呢？換句話說，則新國民運動將根據那一種主義呢？新國民運動不另標主義。因為我們已有了三民主義，所需要的如何實行。</p>
<p>三民主義中心勢力</p>
<p>諸生成者要問為什麽只要一個主義呢？二個主義以上雖然並存不可以嗎？我的等答覆如下：</p>
<p>主義是指示我們運動的方向，黨是集合同一主義的人，以有組織有訓練之紀律的行動，來實行主義。世界各國有多黨林立的政治有二黨對立的政治，有一黨的政治，第一種例如從前的法國，在政治上及經濟上有多數的主義，因而有多數的黨，因為黨的為數太多，沒有一黨能單獨掌握政權，因而各黨聯合起來，共同掌握政權。但是這種聯合是不堅固的，容易聯合，也就容易解散，所以國會之中有早上因數黨的聯合而成立內閣，晚上因數黨的聯合解體而內閣便已　終的，這種國家沒有中心勢力，以行使政權。在太平時代已經紛紛擾擾，　時失事，在危急存亡時代破綻更是百出了。這一次大戰法國敗績其最大原因，即由於此，故戰敗以後，現在法國政府，已毅然決然推翻此種多黨林立的制度了。第二種例如英美一黨在朝，現在英國雖然不止二黨，現在英國雖然不止二黨，可是基礎仍然這樣的，較之多黨林立是好些了，因為任何一黨，都還勉勉强强可以把握中心勢力。第三種順序來說，最先是蘇聯，在民國六年共產黨便專政以至今日，不問共產黨對不對，其已經做成中心勢力，則已是事實。其次是義國，在民國十一年法四斯黨專政，最近雖然有些搖動，但其詳情，尙未得悉，無論如何，過去二十餘年，做成中心勢力，是無縫的，以後如何，仍未可知。又其次是德國，在民國二十二年，國社黨專政，德國人民的組織紀律本來很堅强的，有了國社黨專政，中心勢力更加堅强起來了。日本從前孔明多黨林立的，可是日本早已有一種中心勢力，日本學者說：「日本政治是以天皇為中心的民主政治」，這句說話，是不錯的。近來集合各政黨於大政　贊會，多黨林立的痕跡，更已融化了。照此說來，一個國家，不能沒有中心勢力，不然任何政策，不能推行，在國家危急存亡時代，更為需要，以一個主義，一個黨來做中心勢力，是根據這需要而發生的。　（未完）</p>
<h3>土耳其堅守中立政策</h3>
<p>英美總攻擊的主力指向義大利，業已顯然可見，以前成為第二戰綫候補地的大西洋海岸，巴爾幹等的位置，今日從軍事上的見地看來，已不再是次要的性質，是以關於巴爾幹的登陸戰，土耳其當然减少其首當其衝的軍事上的重要性。英美的歐洲作戰，以義大利為基點，橫貫巴爾幹而直衝東部戰綫的側面。所以假使英美在義大利戰役中能獲成功，則他們第二步的目標，將直指巴爾幹，擊潰各國，使他們脫離軸心陣綫，而使德國陷於孤立。因此，英美開始對義戰役時，同時亦已進行政治活動。英美對義戰役如能獲得預期的成功，則對巴爾幹諸國，雖不出以軍事行動，僅用政治工作，亦有達到其目的的可能性。</p>
<p>但是這塲合，英美用作對巴爾幹活動據點仍是土耳其，而且從此點看來，英美以為土耳其的利用性，較前更甚。換言之，自英美開始義國戰役後，土耳其的軍事情勢雖似鬆弛，但政治的情勢却代之而起，愈見重要。在西西里島戰役展開的前後，當地消息靈通人士的見解，以為英美必將利用其有利的形勢，對土耳其加以壓迫。</p>
<p>在英美方面，如有機會，使土耳其加入反軸心陣綫，固為其夙願。尤其在巴爾幹形勢日趨迫切的今日，更感到握有其基地土耳其的必要。因此，我們可以想像英美最近對土耳其所作的新的活動。二十八日的泰晤士報論及土耳其問題說：</p>
<p>「在戰局對反軸心方面極有利地展開的今日，我們當然希望土其耳故　中閱卷則接近反軸心國方面。但土耳其却固執地維持不必要的中立，實出意外」。</p>
<p>該報從表面上非難土耳其在目前狀况下維持中立的狀態，而强調應在此時捨棄中立，加入反軸心陣綫，此為英美對土耳其企圖之　　的表示。由此，我們不能不見到英美對土耳其已揭開了新的外交政策的序幕。</p>
<p>此外，英大使許　森在昻哥拉的活躍，亦為上述外交攻勢前暗戰的一種表現。至於土耳其的反應，據當地軸心國外交界所傳，最近　綱門卓格爾外長　某軸心國大使說：「我們已經覺悟到最近沈醉於勝利的英美，正對土耳其加以壓迫，但土耳其的中立政策，並不因最近新的事態而有所變化。我們相信對英美的壓迫將頑强對抗。</p>
<p>這是對軸心國外交官的談話，我們雖不能相信這誻土耳其的眞意但至少我們有充分的根據可以推察土耳其不致急速地改變其態度。</p>
<p>但如其英美決定有事於土耳其的時候，則土耳其的態度當視今後義大利的戰局而轉移。換言之，決定土耳其的態度者，不在於英美壓迫的程度如何，而在於德國如何收拾義大利戰局。（翔：譯自八月五日東京朝日新聞，斯坦埠三日電）</p>

<h3>Construction of a New Shanghai and Rectification of Officialdom</h3>
<p>At the time of the Shanghai Concession's takeover, the citizens' joy and excitement reached a peak. This was an expression of the citizens' boundless rejoicing at the birth of a new Shanghai. Subsequently, both officials and the public continuously expressed their opinions. Although their perspectives differed due to their respective positions, they all held limitless hopes for the future of the new Shanghai. Therefore, the construction of a new Shanghai deserves repeated discussion and tireless pursuit of details, ensuring that this newborn infant is nurtured and developed to meet the expectations of citizens and all parties. This newspaper has previously discussed the institutions of public opinion and the selection of talented individuals, taking the trouble to do so because of this reason. Now, we will further elaborate on the rectification of officialdom.</p>
<p>In the recent two centuries, the ethos of Chinese officialdom can be described as deteriorating day by day. Instances of harming the country and its people are too numerous to count. The facts are all there, undeniable. Moreover, the emergence of concessions stemmed from the corruption of officialdom. Afterward, who is to blame for tolerating their encroachment and defiance? The past lessons of nurturing evils and leaving behind future troubles serve as a warning. While this specifically addresses Shanghai, it can certainly be applied to other places. When the National Government initially returned to the capital, it was an opportunity to reform officialdom. However, the national leaders who were pioneering new ideas and managing the fragmented situation may have had no choice but to compromise and appease, failing to reach the ideal state. But now, with the birth of a new Shanghai, popular support, and well-established institutions, we can proceed calmly and methodically with a thorough and complete renewal, establishing a long-term plan. Shanghai, in any aspect of politics, economics, or society, has always had an influence on the entire country, so the goodness or badness of its officialdom not only affects the construction of the new Shanghai but will also affect the fate of the entire country. We wish to take this opportunity, at this new beginning with the people, to outline and explain the essential points and methods for rectifying officialdom below:</p>
<p>(A) Essential Points: "The people are the most important, the state comes next, and the ruler is the least important." This is an ancient proverb that may seem out of step with today. If translated into modern terms, it would be "The common people come first, the government comes second, and the officials are the least important." The meaning is very clear and irrefutable. Because the interests of a few officials are not necessarily the interests of the government, and even less so the interests of the common people. Conversely, what benefits the common people necessarily benefits the government, and the officials also receive its blessings. Take the general tax system as an example. On the surface, it advocates a contracted system, but in reality, it is still a monopolized nature. Government agencies may not have to expend the labor of collecting and auditing taxes, receiving the amount they are due on time, but those who contract are mostly motivated by profit. If there is a surplus after paying taxes, they report upwards at each level, pocketing the difference. As a result, they concoct various pretexts to impose exorbitant taxes and levies. This directly increases the burden on citizens and indirectly hinders the development of all industries. In the end, the people's livelihood declines, and the government treasury is not full. This is one example of valuing the ruler over the people. On the other hand, in countries with enlightened officialdom, the greater the determination to achieve affluence, the more difficulties arise at the beginning. The general public often lacks sufficient capital to undertake such arduous tasks, and they hesitate. Therefore, at the outset, the government must contribute capital and take the lead, using political power to overcome the initial difficulties. Once the foundation is solid, then the government can recover the corresponding costs and allow private operation, with proper supervision. With the income generated, other enterprises can be initiated in the same way, circulating and evolving, and all industries will flourish. The wealth of the country and the strength of the people are by no means accidental. This is an example of valuing the people over the ruler. When the people are prosperous, how can the ruler be lacking? When the whole world is in distress, the ruler's heavenly mandate will end. Taking "the people are the most important" as a creed, and renewing the spirit of officialdom, this is the first essential point. The relationship between officials and the people is like that between a father and his son. They should be loved with kindness and righteousness, and governed by a standard. Therefore, a family has family rules, and a country has national laws, encouraging good and punishing evil, maintaining order. However, wherever there is law, there is evasion. Cunning people will inevitably employ their devious tricks to achieve their illegal purposes. First, they deceive, then they seek favors. Once they grasp the weaknesses of officials, they can demand whatever they want and act with impunity. They may even collude with each other, protecting each other. They knowingly violate the law and act as if no one is watching. Those who steal a hook are punished, while those who steal a state become princes. Officials are allowed to set fires, while the common people are not allowed to light lamps. The imperial edicts are regarded as mere formalities by the government itself. When those at the top favor something, those below will do it even more excessively, leading to corruption and collusion between officials and merchants. Laws and regulations become tools for monopolizing and hoarding goods, and a protective talisman for competing with the people for profits. What else can be said? In the past, the concessions each governed themselves, and may have been somewhat disconnected from the local sentiments. Whenever an order for price controls was issued, prices would inevitably rise, a strange phenomenon indeed. Now that political power is complete, it is essential to adhere to the principle that "governance lies not in many words, but in ensuring that every word is acted upon," establishing the authority and credibility of officialdom. This is the second essential point.</p>
<p>(B) Methods: Although there are only two essential points, the methods for implementing the rectification of officialdom are numerous and complex. Without engaging in circuitous discussions, we will only address the essential points: All policies and programs must be carefully considered before a firm determination is made. Relying on momentary impulses and seeking temporary satisfaction will inevitably lead to difficulties in sustaining them. Thrift must begin with officials. Without frugality, there can be no integrity; without integrity, there is no shame; and those who are shameless are not fit to be human, let alone to govern others. Shanghai is a prosperous city, and frugality is especially important. In the past, the concessions were special areas, which were also breeding grounds for all kinds of evils. Now, the residents of the city are one, and officials should also be treated equally. Clearly defined objectives should be the standard for performance evaluation, without favoritism or partisanship, and rewards and punishments should be clear. Those who knowingly violate the law should be punished more severely, and those who are incompetent should be replaced immediately. Only with sound personnel can sound undertakings be managed. Shanghai has recently become a center for the offices of various regions and institutions. Whether each of them is necessary will not be discussed in detail here. However, they must be treated with sincerity and respect, and their powers and responsibilities must be clearly defined. The organization of Shanghai itself is already complex and intricate, and its effectiveness should not be reduced by unnecessary bureaucracy. Other aspects, such as how officials should lead by example, and how the salaries of public servants should be raised, will not be listed here.</p>
<p>With public opinion reaching upwards, talented individuals excelling, and officialdom rectified, these three being in place, Shanghai will be well-governed, the entire country will flourish, and the ethos will not only develop its power, but also jointly defend East Asia, enjoying the happiness of freedom and independence forever.</p>
<h3>Solomon Islands Area: Japanese Air Force Achieves Results, Three Enemy Transport Ships Sunk</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 3 p.m. on the 15th: Japanese military air units attacked straits in the Longa area (north of Guadalcanal Island) and swept enemy aircraft in the Runumbu Island area, sinking three large transport ships. Japanese aircraft also dispatched another unit to attack enemy airfields, destroying and burning one airfield each. The Japanese fighter squadron attacking the Renterba area engaged ten enemy fighters over Munda, shooting down a total of six. In this battle, the Japanese lost one aircraft.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency) – General MacArthur's headquarters announced today: A large formation of Japanese aircraft conducted an air raid on Kiriwina Island in the Solomon Islands on the night of the 13th. It was also stated that another large formation of Japanese aircraft heavily bombed enemy positions near Kilocco.</p>
<h3>Military and Civilian Food Supplies in Various Regions: The Ministry of Food Has Made Preparations; Vice Minister Zhou of the Ministry of Food Issues a Statement</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency) – Vice Minister Zhou of the Ministry of Food issued the following statement to reporters:</p>
<p>The fluctuation of prices is inherently based on cost, demand, and supply. Now, in the era of the Greater East Asia War of National Liberation, prices cannot be compared with peacetime. Either costs increase due to labor and raw materials, or supply is not smooth due to quantity and transportation issues, causing prices to soar. This is unavoidable. However, the current rise in prices lacks any standard and is arbitrarily inflated. It is not uncommon for prices to increase by 40% or 50% in a single day. This is clearly not solely due to increased costs or the inability to balance supply and demand, but rather is caused by speculative hoarding by unscrupulous merchants. Controlling materials and stopping speculative hoarding are necessary measures to stabilize the people's livelihood during wartime. Food is essential for the people's lives and is more important than other materials. The government has recognized this and implemented controls for three years. Merchants and the public in the accumulated water areas can all understand the meaning and methods of compilation. Although speculative hoarding of food has not been completely eliminated, it is not as rampant or unrestrained as it could be. In addition, the Ministry provides widespread food rations to cities lacking food. Although there may be black markets in those areas, they are only fleeting and cannot last long. Therefore, during this time of wild rains and sudden rises and falls of abnormal price fluctuations, the fact that rice can remain relatively stable is indeed the most gratifying thing.</p>
<p>Now, the large-scale entry of new grains is imminent. The Ministry has made full preparations for the military and civilian food supplies needed in various regions during the lean season, so there is no need to worry. This can be reassuring to the people in various regions. We hope that the people will trust the government and not panic. Not only is hoarding and speculating illegal and not allowed by the government, and will be subject to legal sanctions, but individuals and families should also not hoard. In the past, because of price stimulation and fear that even a handful of rice would rise in price along with other goods, the general public rushed to buy and store private supplies. Although the amount purchased by each person was small, the large number of people purchasing and storing food meant that the quantity accumulated into a huge amount, causing an imbalance between supply and demand, and causing the price of rice to rise to the same level as other goods. It is hoped that the people will correct this situation themselves, so that the long-term stability of rice prices will not be a problem.</p>
<h3>Rome Declared a Non-Defended City: Anti-Axis Countries Propose Prerequisites; The City Must Not Have Any Military Function</h3>
<p>Rome, 15th (Central News Agency) – The Stefani Agency announced today: The Italian government has, through the Vatican, notified the relevant countries that it has decided to declare Rome a non-defended city starting from July 31st, and wants to know under what circumstances this proposal can be accepted. Rome is the center of Catholicism, and because it has been repeatedly attacked, the Italian government no longer hesitates and officially announces that Rome is a non-defended city, and takes necessary measures to comply with international law.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency) – According to Reuters in London: Officials announced yesterday that the British government's attitude towards Italy's declaration of Rome as a non-defended city is unaffected. Italy's unilateral declaration cannot affect the freedom of action of the Supreme Commander of the Anti-Axis countries.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency) – According to Huitong News Agency: Informed sources in Quebec pointed out last night that the Anti-Axis countries have agreed in principle to the Italian government's declaration of Rome as a non-defended city, but the prerequisite is that the Italian government must provide absolute evidence to prove that Rome will no longer have any military purpose.</p>
<p>Seven Hundred Killed and Injured in Rome Bombing</p>

<h3>Chongqing's Military Expenses in Dire Straits: Mandatory Payment</h3>
<p>Guangdong, 15th (Central News Agency) – According to reports from Chongqing, Chongqing's military expenses are in dire straits. They have appealed for a movement to comfort the troops and raise funds for soldiers, but without success. Finding no other solution, Chongqing plans to announce mandatory measures, assigning burdens to various provinces, and ordering payment. This has further aroused resentment and criticism from the public. This shows the poverty of Chongqing's finances, and that even military expenses cannot be maintained. At the same time, it also reflects the people's heartfelt disgust for the so-called "resistance war" under Chongqing's heavy taxation and extortion.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Chen Returns to Post</h3>

Japan and Germany must work closely together to fight against the common enemy."</p>
<h3>Outline of the New National Movement</h3>
<p>— Wang Jingwei</p>
<p>The outline of the New National Movement was taught in the New National Movement Training Camp for Civil Servants and Youth During the Summer Vacation. The first and second sessions were taught in three lectures each, each lasting about one and a half hours. The main ideas of the lectures were the same, the only difference being the elaboration, extension, and repeated emphasis. Now, the redundancies have been removed, the essentials have been extracted, and this draft has been written for the students' review. — Self-awareness by Jingwei</p>
<p>Main Idea of the Second Lecture</p>
<p>The first lecture discussed the origin of the New National Movement. In detail, the initiation of the New National Movement lies in having us recognize the mission of the new era and cultivate the responsibility and ability to be able to take on the mission of the new era.</p>
<p>So, what will be the content of the New National Movement? In other words, what kind of ideology will the New National Movement be based on? The New National Movement does not create a new ideology. Because we already have the Three Principles of the People, what is needed is how to implement them.</p>
<p>Central Force of the Three Principles of the People</p>
<p>Students may ask why only one ideology is needed. Can't two or more ideologies coexist? My response is as follows:</p>
<p>Ideology guides the direction of our movement, and the party is a group of people who share the same ideology and use organized, trained, and disciplined action to implement that ideology. The politics of various countries in the world include multi-party politics, two-party politics, and one-party politics. The first type, for example, was France in the past. In politics and economics, there were multiple ideologies, and therefore multiple parties. Because there were too many parties, no one party could independently control the government, so various parties united to jointly control the government. However, this kind of union is not strong, and it is easy to unite and easy to dissolve. Therefore, in the parliament, there are cabinets that are established in the morning due to the union of several parties, and cabinets that are dissolved and terminated in the evening due to the dissolution of the same parties. This kind of country lacks a central force to exercise political power. In times of peace, it is already noisy and chaotic, and accidents occur from time to time. In times of crisis and survival, the flaws are even more obvious. The defeat of France in this war was largely due to this. Therefore, after the defeat, the current French government has resolutely overthrown this multi-party system. The second type, such as the United Kingdom and the United States, has one party in power. Although there are more than two parties in the United Kingdom now, the foundation is still like this, which is better than multi-party politics, because any one party can still barely grasp the central force. The third type, in order of sequence, the first is the Soviet Union. In the sixth year of the Republic of China, the Communist Party began its dictatorship until today. Regardless of whether the Communist Party is right or wrong, the fact is that it has created a central force. The second is Italy. In the eleventh year of the Republic of China, the Fascist Party began its dictatorship. Although there have been some fluctuations recently, the details are not yet known. In any case, it has created a central force for the past twenty years, which is seamless. What will happen in the future is still unknown. Then there is Germany. In the twenty-second year of the Republic of China, the National Socialist Party began its dictatorship. The German people's organization and discipline have always been very strong. With the dictatorship of the National Socialist Party, the central force has become even stronger. In the past, Japan had many parties like Kong Ming, but Japan has long had a central force. Japanese scholars say: "Japanese politics is democratic politics with the Emperor as the center." This sentence is correct. Recently, the collection of various political parties in the Imperial Rule Assistance Association has further melted the traces of multi-party politics. According to this, a country cannot be without a central force, otherwise any policy cannot be implemented. It is even more needed in times of national crisis and survival. Using one ideology and one party as the central force is based on this need. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Turkey Adheres to Neutrality Policy</h3>
<p>It is clear that the main force of the Anglo-American general offensive is aimed at Italy. The positions of the Atlantic coast and the Balkans, which were previously candidates for the second front, are no longer of secondary importance from a military point of view. Therefore, regarding the landing battle in the Balkans, Turkey has of course reduced its military importance as the first to bear the brunt. Anglo-American European operations use Italy as a base point, traversing the Balkans and directly attacking the side of the Eastern Front. Therefore, if the Anglo-Americans can succeed in the Italian campaign, their second step will be to directly target the Balkans, defeat the countries, and make them break away from the Axis front, isolating Germany. Therefore, the Anglo-Americans also began political activities while starting the Italian campaign. If the Anglo-American campaign against Italy can achieve the expected success, then even without military action against the Balkan countries, the possibility of achieving their goals by using political work alone exists.</p>
<p>However, in this case, Turkey is still used by the Anglo-Americans as a base for activities in the Balkans. Moreover, from this point of view, the Anglo-Americans believe that Turkey's utility is even greater than before. In other words, although Turkey's military situation seems to have relaxed since the Anglo-Americans began the Italian campaign, the political situation has taken its place and become more important. Around the time the Battle of Sicily began, local informed sources believed that the Anglo-Americans would definitely take advantage of their favorable situation to exert pressure on Turkey.</p>
<p>On the Anglo-American side, if there is an opportunity to make Turkey join the Anti-Axis front, it has always been their wish. Especially today, when the situation in the Balkans is becoming increasingly urgent, they feel the need to hold their base, Turkey. Therefore, we can imagine the new activities that the Anglo-Americans have recently carried out against Turkey. The Times of the 28th commented on the Turkish issue, saying:</p>
<p>"Today, when the war situation is unfolding extremely favorably for the Anti-Axis, we certainly hope that Turkey will approach the Anti-Axis countries. However, Turkey stubbornly maintains unnecessary neutrality, which is unexpected."</p>
<p>The newspaper outwardly criticized Turkey's state of maintaining neutrality in the current situation, and emphasized that it should abandon neutrality at this time and join the Anti-Axis front. This is a clear expression of the Anglo-American attempt on Turkey. From this, we cannot fail to see that the Anglo-Americans have opened a new chapter in their diplomatic policy towards Turkey.</p>
<p>In addition, British Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen's activities in Ankara are also a manifestation of a kind of covert warfare before the aforementioned diplomatic offensive. As for Turkey's reaction, according to local Axis diplomatic circles, Foreign Minister Numan Menemencioğlu recently told a certain Axis ambassador: "We have realized that the Anglo-Americans, who have recently been drunk with victory, are putting pressure on Turkey, but Turkey's neutrality policy will not change due to the recent new events. We believe that we will resist the Anglo-American pressure tenaciously."</p>
<p>This is a conversation with an Axis diplomat, and we cannot believe the true meaning of this Turkish statement, but at least we have sufficient grounds to speculate that Turkey will not rapidly change its attitude.</p>
<p>But if the Anglo-Americans decide to do something about Turkey, then Turkey's attitude will shift depending on the future Italian war situation. In other words, what determines Turkey's attitude is not the degree of Anglo-American pressure, but how Germany resolves the Italian war situation.

<h3>After the General Chamber of Commerce Purchased Yarn and Cloth, Fixed Prices Were Stipulated</h3>
<p>All Yarn and Cloth is Not Allowed to Move Before Purchases are Complete</p>
<p>The National Government authorities, seeing that it was essential to eliminate national stockpiles and thoroughly stabilize prices, were determined to gradually nationalize major materials and adopt effective wartime material controls in order to balance supply and demand, ensuring that military and civilian needs were met without annual shortages. Cotton yarn and cloth, which were sufficient to stimulate drastic price changes, had been approved for purchase by the Supreme National Defense Conference on the 9th, and temporary regulations and implementation outlines for the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth were promulgated, ordering the National General Chamber of Commerce to handle the purchase of Shanghai's existing yarn and cloth. After receiving the order, the Chamber had already drafted detailed rules for the implementation of the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth, submitted them to the Executive Yuan for approval and record, and today (the 16th), it will formally establish an office for the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth to start work and purchase according to the promulgated detailed rules for the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth. Before the purchase work is completely completed, all yarn and cloth existing in warehouses and factories in this city are not allowed to move. It is said that the purchased yarn and cloth will still be allocated by the General Chamber of Commerce at fixed prices.</p>
<h3>The Materials Investigation Committee Investigates Various Warehouses: Distinguishing Between Public and Private Warehouses</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Materials Investigation Committee has decided to first investigate the stockpiling of cotton yarn and cloth in Shanghai, according to the first meeting. The investigators of the committee, led by the Japanese investigation officer, divided the entire city into thirty groups to investigate public warehouses, totaling 233, and the investigation has been completely completed. The quantity of cotton yarn and cloth stored in each warehouse, the date of entry, and the names of all cargo owners or merchants were reviewed to see if there was any stockpiling, and whether they had registered with the authorities. If there were any doubts, or if the facts were unclear, further investigation would be required. This review work has been completed. As for the stockpiling of yarn and cloth in private warehouses, after conducting an investigation, it will be submitted for review for separate disposition.</p>
<h3>The Movement of Cotton Textiles to Other Ports is Limited to Actual Needs</h3>
<p>If manufacturers in this city need to transport cotton textiles to other ports, they can first fill out an application for removal, have it stamped and certified by the cotton textile industry association and the cotton textile association, and then request permission from the Material Transfer Permit Office of the General Chamber of Commerce before they can leave the country. The materials to be moved are limited to actual needs.</p>
<h3>The First District Will Establish a Baojia Office</h3>
<p>According to sources, the Baojia cadre structure of the unified municipal administration in this city has not changed. In the future, each Baojia district will strive to maintain mutual contact in order to obtain greater results in self-police work. The news that the First District Office will establish a Baojia Office has been confirmed by officials to reporters from Datong News Agency. It is expected that the staff responsible for this work will still be personnel from the old Baojia Guidance Department and other key personnel related to the promotion of Baojia affairs.</p>
<h3>Sugar Merchants' Business Office to be Reorganized</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of sugar rationing in this city, the sugar supply in each district has gradually become stable. However, the sugar stocks of Chinese merchants have gradually been exhausted. However, the military distribution authorities have a large amount of Taiwanese sugar arriving in Shanghai, ready to continue to handle the sugar rationing and maintain the normal supply of sugar. However, the Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office is no longer applicable. It is reported that it will be reorganized starting next month. All the huge profits of the Business Office have long been allocated. At that time, the name of the Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office will be changed to the Sugar Merchants' Wholesale Operation Society.</p>
<h3>Sixth Phase Household Sugar: Purchase Certificates to be Collected Today and Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative Promotion Office, with the approval of the Military Allocation Bureau, is handling the distribution of sugar based on household population for the sixth phase, as well as special allocations for various industries. Our Shanghai news reporter learned from relevant sources yesterday that the sugar allocation for the sixth phase is ready. All type A retailers must, within today and tomorrow, take the previously issued blank receipts, affix their seals, and go to the office to collect sugar purchase certificates, and pay for and pick up the goods at the designated sugar firms before the 18th. Sugar will be sold upon presentation of the sugar purchase certificate issued by the authorities, from August 21st to 31st. The quantity is half a catty per person. Special allocations for various industries will begin soon. All procedures will be expedited, and notices of when and how to collect the sugar purchase certificates and pick up the goods will be issued to each household.</p>
<h3>Director of the National Health Administration Came to Shanghai, Tea Party Yesterday</h3>
<p>Lu Runzhi, Director of the National Health Administration, came to Shanghai on official business. A grand reception tea party was held yesterday (the 15th) at 5 p.m. in the auditorium of Aurora University. Around 400 people attended, including representatives from the local health authorities, the press, the medical and pharmaceutical fields, and various related authorities. Director Lu said in his speech that since the national government returned to Nanjing, the organization of the National Health Administration is still in its initial stages, having been established for less than two months. Shanghai is the largest city in the country, and all policies rely on this major city to take the lead. All suggestions are especially dependent on the contributions of advanced thinkers. At the beginning of his tenure as Director of the National Health Administration, Lu Runzhi considered the following points to be particularly important:  For national epidemic prevention, it is planned to prepare and manufacture sufficient quantities of vaccines to ensure the widespread implementation of epidemic prevention work.  For health insurance, a new organization should be formed, following the example of Germany, so that the general working people can have methods for disease prevention and treatment. It is planned to first pilot this in the Shanghai area.  Careful examination of the qualifications of doctors and pharmacists is needed. It is planned to draft a Doctors Law and a Pharmacists Law in the near future and submit them to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation and approval.  Establishment of a National Health Association, which will be a consulting body, and more assistance from the medical and pharmaceutical fields is needed, as well as publicity and assistance from the press.</p>
<h3>Minister of Social Welfare Gave a Speech at the Summer Training Camp</h3>
<p>Mo Decun, Minister of Social Welfare, gave a special lecture at the New Citizen Movement Civil Servants and Youth Training Camp the other day. The topic was "Social Policy in Wartime." He gave a very detailed explanation of the meaning of social policy, the importance of social policy in wartime, the government's emphasis on social policy, and the key points of various important policies of the Ministry of Social Welfare.</p>
<h3>French Association Seeks Chinese Members</h3>
<p>The French Sports Association on Route Pichon (now Fuxing West Road) in this city (referred to as the French Association) has always been managed by French citizens and open to foreign residents in Shanghai as a club and for banquets after work. There have been no Chinese members. After the French Concession was taken over by the National Government, Foreign Minister Chu Minyi, in order to emphasize amateur communication among Chinese people and correct past misunderstandings, discussed the methods for Chinese to join the association with French Ambassador Cosme. It was decided to establish an honorary board of directors consisting of both Chinese and French members in addition to the original board of directors. The honorary chairman of the Chinese side is Foreign Minister Chu Minyi, the vice chairman is Auditor General Xia Qifeng, and the directors are Shanghai Municipal Government Secretary-General Zhao Zunyue, Wu Kaisheng, Ambassador Zaisheng, and Director of the National Health Administration Lu Runzhi. The honorary chairman of the French side is French Ambassador Cosme, and the directors are French Consul General Majire, Counselor of the French Embassy Sadok, French Consul, President of the French Court Coubert, and Commander of the French Army Esha Dai (Major General). Furthermore, the Chinese honorary board of directors will select five people: Zhao Jinqing, Geng Jiaji, Gong Xiang, Wei Tingrong, and Nong Ruhui, etc. to be responsible for the review of Chinese membership applications. It is stipulated that meetings will be held twice a month to handle matters such as the review of Chinese membership applications. The first meeting is scheduled to be held at the end of this month. To show their sincerity in welcoming Chinese members, the French board of directors held a banquet at the association on the 11th to entertain the Chinese directors. Foreign Minister Chu, Xia, and all the directors were invited to attend, and the atmosphere was very harmonious. It was decided on the spot to start seeking Chinese members from the 16th of this month. Application forms and the association's charter can be obtained from the association's secretariat at any time. As for the membership procedures, regardless of gender, applicants must be introduced by two or more members of the association and be approved by the Chinese directors to obtain membership. All membership fees have also been separately set and listed in the membership rules.</p>
<h3>Lu Qi Broadcast</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Propaganda Office broadcast last night (the 15th), presented by Lu Qi, head of the Shanghai Special Municipality Rural Area Political Work Group. He explained the importance of unifying the thinking of Shanghai citizens, practicing the New Citizen Movement, building a new Shanghai, and responding to the work of cleaning up the rural areas in the suburbs. The content was brief and to the point.</p>
<h3>Central China Tobacco Association: Preventing Distribution Malpractices</h3>
<p>Eleventh Phase of Goods Distribution, Payment, and Pickup</p>
<p>The Central China Tobacco Allocation Association, after thoroughly eliminating the black market and preventing malpractices by distributors, has stipulated standards for wholesale and retail merchants. It also investigates each distributor to determine:  Whether the types and quantities of goods sold by the retailer's own stores exceed the limits set by the association.  Whether the goods are allocated disproportionately to the retailer's own stores, and whether the allocation to affiliated retailers is fair.  Whether tobacco is sold above the designated price, or whether there is hoarding or refusal to sell.  Whether the tobacco storage methods and the quantity of tobacco in stock are appropriate.</p>
<p>Eleventh Phase Distribution Method</p>
<p>According to our Shanghai reporter's inquiries with the association, the eleventh phase of goods distribution has already begun. Wholesale and retail merchants are required to pay and pick up their goods. It is expected that sales will be widespread around the 20th. There will be no changes in prices or methods. The goods will be allocated according to the A, B, C, and D system, and the quantities will be slightly less than in the previous phase. The value of grade A is approximately ten thousand yuan, and the values of grades B and C are reduced proportionally.</p>
<h3>Health Tips After Wading Through Water: Rickshaw Pullers Should Pay Attention</h3>
<p>With excessive rainfall in recent days, vehicles cannot travel, and the only available means of transportation is the rickshaw. These rickshaw pullers wade through water all day long, and microbial erosion is a major hazard. To prevent diseases caused by microbes, after wading through water, wipe dry with a dry towel, do not eat raw, cold, fried, or greasy foods, do not accumulate food in the stomach, and do not overexert the body to aid digestion. Do not be greedy for coolness at night; try to sweat a little. If all these points are noted, the incidence of disease can be reduced.</p>
<h3>Wheat Rationing Amounts for Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Provinces</h3>
<p>The Flour and Wheat Special Operations Committee under the Business Coordination Council has estimated the wheat rationing amount for Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces at 34,000 dan per day. The flour prices are stipulated as follows:  First-grade flour: 311.26 yuan,  Second-grade flour: 270.06 yuan,  Third-grade flour: 208.26 yuan.</p>
<h3>Central China Tobacco Production Increased by 30% Compared to Last Year</h3>
<p>Central China Tobacco Co., Ltd. recently convened a meeting of regional directors. Attendees included regional directors from Hangzhou, Wuhu, Datong, Anhui, and other locations. According to reports, due to harmonious weather after the implementation of the production increase campaign in various regions, production is expected to increase by 30% compared to last year. It is estimated that this year's production will reach 2.5 million guan (one guan equals 100 Chinese taels).</p>
<h3>Highest Authority Planned for Police Agencies in Two Districts</h3>
<p>Its scope may extend to the western districts of Shanghai</p>
<p>The former two concessions are the two most important areas in Shanghai. Now that they have been taken over, the entire city's police system, under the leadership of the mayor, has been unified. A new page has been turned in the history of Shanghai's police force. Former Police Commissioner Watari Tadashi and former Nanjing Police Chief Su Chengde have both been appointed as deputy directors of the First and Third Police Bureaus. The two are busy planning to strengthen the police agencies in these two areas as much as possible in the near future. According to general opinion, in order to obtain the maximum effectiveness of the police force in the former two concessions, a centralized agency with supreme authority will be established to issue orders and commands at any time. Its scope will also extend to the former Shanghai Extra-Settlement Area and part of the urban area.</p>
<p>Medical Baojia System Becomes Connected</p>
<p>Regarding the preliminary rumors of the establishment of a centralized police authority, officials have not yet revealed any information. Although the police bureau in the old Police Department on Fuzhou Road may indeed become the ideal supreme police agency, on the other hand, the police bureau in the old French Police Department will implement training under its command. In addition to his responsibilities in the police force, Su is also the head of the Baojia self-defense system in the First and Eighth Districts. The Baojia is now an important organization for maintaining public order in the city, but the process of unifying it is simpler than unifying the police agencies.</p>
<h3>Social Insurance Bureau Sets Up Business Offices: All Established Today</h3>
<p>The Social Simple Insurance Bureau, in order to facilitate the promotion of its business in the future, has established business offices in various major districts of the city, all of which have been established today. The First Business Office is located at 126 Moganshan Road, handling business west of Denglu Road in the First District. The Second Business Office is located at 2 Songcun, at the intersection of Route Tenant de Croc and Route Paul Henry Villar in the Eighth District, handling business south of Xujiahui and the Great West Road. The Third Business Office is located in Jinchang Lane, Fangbang Road, Nanshi, handling business in the Seventh District. The Fourth Business Office is located in Xin Pudong Lane, Dongchang Road, Pudong, handling factories participating in compulsory labor insurance in Pudong. They can go to the nearest business office to apply for insurance procedures.</p>
<h3>Route 20 Trolleybus Resumes Two Stops</h3>
<p>Route 20 trolleybus, which runs between Zhaofeng Park and the Bund outside the Fourth Road, announced by the trolleybus company authorities on July 30 that the two stops, Zhaofeng Village and Hongye Garden, would be temporarily cancelled. According to our Datong News Agency reporter's inquiry, the two stops have been restored to use since yesterday (the 15th). The Hongye Garden stop will stop whenever the trolleybus passes, while the Zhaofeng Village stop will only be used between 10:00 AM and 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Brief News</h3>

<h3>Applying for Reserve Discounts Should Not Be Used for Speculation</h3>
<p>In order to stabilize finance and suppress prices, the Central Reserve Bank has decided to strictly handle applications for deposit reserve discounts from silver and money shops in order to prevent them from using the discounted funds for speculation.  The discount security for this reserve is limited to shops that have paid all their reserves in cash. This does not apply to those who use 40% cash and 60% substitute goods.  The maximum amount of the discount is 80% of the deposit reserve (that is, it must be within the 80% range, not calculated across the board at 80%).  The discount will be temporarily applied to the seven-day drafts of each shop.  The applications for discount from each shop must be for the purpose of meeting temporary financial needs and must not be used for other purposes such as hoarding or speculation.  When applying for a discount, the shop must clearly state the purpose in a letter to the guild, and then the guild must issue a letter to the Central Bank as proof before the discount can be obtained.</p>
<p>In addition, the Silver Association and Qianzhuang Bureau, in order to relieve the financial difficulties of small banks and qianzhuang and prevent them from closing down, will allow small banks and qianzhuang to use negotiable securities as collateral to apply for borrowing from the Silver Association and Qianzhuang Bureau. It is understood that the borrowing method is based on the average of the face value and the current purchase price.</p>
<h3>Establishments Not Joining Guilds Will Be Denied Supplies</h3>
<p>The relevant authorities in this city have repeatedly ordered all companies and businesses in the city to join their respective trade guilds as members in accordance with regulations; otherwise, they will be ordered to suspend business. According to our Shanghai reporter, all companies and businesses that have not joined their respective guilds will be denied the right to enjoy supplies and will not be allowed to enter the market for transactions. However, the membership lists of each guild must be submitted to the authorities for verification and must not be intentionally delayed. The following information must be clearly stated on the list:  Member business name.  Name of the representative.  Age.  Native place.  Experience.  Education.  Current occupation.  Party affiliation.  Mailing address.  Remarks. It is also understood that recently, in order to take care of the business of their fellow traders and the convenience of citizens to purchase goods, all guilds have submitted requests to the authorities to grant them continuous allocation of materials and raw materials, so that they can distribute them to their member colleagues in grades and sell them in stores in accordance with regulations.</p>
<h3>Guiding Private Capital into the Right Track to Develop Productive Enterprises</h3>
<p>Establishment of three companies, including pharmaceuticals</p>
<p>Since the authorities began managing finance and cracking down on speculation, much of the private capital in the market has shifted to normal uses. Especially recently, with the central government's determination to curb prices and strictly crack down on national hoarding, all sectors of this city are actively seeking ways to guide private capital towards productive enterprises in order to revive the national wartime economy. Therefore, new companies and factories have been established in this city one after another. Among the largest are three major companies: China Pharmaceuticals, Fuzhong Tea, and Jixiang Electric Power. They are organized and initiated by major figures from the medical, financial, and industrial sectors, and the situation of raising funds is excellent, which is enough to show that all sectors attach great importance to the above-mentioned undertakings. It is said that there are still some shares left, and they are being publicly offered to raise more funds widely.</p>
<h3>Jiangzhe Enterprise Bank Preparing to Resume Business</h3>
<p>After Jiangzhe Enterprise Bank temporarily suspended business due to illiquidity, the chairman and general manager of the bank have worked hard to increase the original capital of 1.5 million yuan to 5 million yuan. It is now learned that the bank has convened a special shareholders' meeting to report on the accounts and discuss future business issues. As soon as the shareholders' meeting approves, it will be announced.</p>
