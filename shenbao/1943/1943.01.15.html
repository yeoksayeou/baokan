<p>社評</p>
<h3>冬賑與糧食　——目前上海兩大嚴重問題——</h3>
<p>連日本市氣候突然嚴寒，溫度曾至泳點以下，僅本月十一日一夜朔風的結果，凍餓而死的，比比皆是，眞是慘不忍睹。而且經常在朔風飢餓中哀號掙扎的，尚不知有幾百幾千以至幾萬。如果說人皆有惻隱之心，那麼，凡吾市民對這些飢寒交迫的同胞，就決不能袖手旁觀了。特別是一輩富豪，一席千金，更應該撫心自問，節省那些歌舞歡樂的浪費的幾分之幾，便可以救助成百成千的苦難的同胞了。同時，更希望各當局與各慈善團體認眞搶救，要知道多救一生命，即多爲國家民族保留一分元氣，也就是多替社會挽回一分危機。</p>
<p>然而，我們除了爲飢寒交迫的街頭貧民呼籲急賑以外，更願以至誠喚起本市中日當局和社會領袖們注意：今日倒斃於朔風飢餓之中的貧已，也就是昨天辛苦服務衣食不足的隱貧階層。目前特別嚴重而更值得重視的，還有糧食問題。最近中日當局爲了調節民食，取締黑市，統籌糧食之支配，自十三日起，實行統制糧食新辦法，禁止淸鄉區內食糧運滬，私販囤積，一概查禁，畸形黑市，決予取締。從當局的糧食政策說，這是再　底簡掩沒有了。可是，從這一舉措的反　和數白萬市民的生活着眼，我們輿論界不能默默無言。</p>
<p>我們願意鄭車指出的是，目前糧食問題，決不是數量不足的問題，也不是一般市民所推測由於參戰後協力日本戰時需要而引起，我們從上海附近一百數十公里以內食糧生產的情况來看，不僅足够人民自給，同時確有餘裕可以供給當地友軍的需要。可是糧食問題是怎樣發生的呢？它發生在少數人的操縱市塲，和囤積居奇、所以，我們對於當局之新的糧食對策，注意於取締囤積與黑市，同時增加戶口米的配給量，是十分贊同的。不過，下面幾個具體問題，不能不加以考慮。</p>
<p>第一，關於取締囤積方面，在當局鑒於去秋米穀收成不惡，而上海附近各地，米價　飛漲不已，實由於囤積操縱與私運私販所致，所以從取締囤慎操縱私運私販着手，但是，我們認爲任何政策，和醫師治病一樣，必須究明病根所在，然後對病發藥，始可求共霍然而有起色。現在糧食方面的囤積操縱私運私販的現象，是怎樣發生的？顯然還是由於本市廣大市民對於糧食的需要，因爲每一市民所領得的戶口米不足維持其最低限度的生活，不得不求之於黑市買賣。譬如自來水，市民每日可以獲得充分的供應，便無所需於囤積了。這不是說笑話，這是現實。所以一切取締辦法，我們認爲必須使市民的糧食需要，獲得滿足後，方可實施。</p>
<p>其次，當局爲了實施整個糧食政策，採取了統一收購政策，禁止人民私運私販，這在原則上是無　疵議的。但是，一種非常嚴重的事實却不能不特別注意，那就是當、局所指定特許收購糧食的一部份日商，往往利用這種特權，一方面壓低收買農民的米價，另一方面又不努力幫助當局收購糧食達到預定數量，或許使當局時感糧食之不足，不得不採取上海附近各地糧食的輸入，幷嚴禁人民私運私販。因此，這種特許收購制度一日不改善，則不僅妨礙當局的糧食政策之完成，勢必增加糧食問題的嚴重性。</p>
<p>最近第二十四期的戶口糧，巳有增加，每人配給二升，麵粉增爲二市斤，這自然是很好的。可是，依照每一個市民最低生活必需的數量，還是不足二分之一。市民所得，不能維持日常生活，而大多數人家又無粒米之儲存，則勢必求之於黑市與私販，則黑市私販之禁雖嚴，仍不能無「鋋而走險」之慮。語云，「衣食足而後知榮辱」，今食糧不足，小民無知，雖有嚴令，有不足以畏之者，實在不能不爲社會前途作杞愛。據悉以後戶口米有逐漸增加至每期每人四升之計劃，這未嘗不是市民的福音，我們只希望火速實現，因爲家無顆粒之蓄的市民實在太多了。</p>

<h3>中國解放在此一戰　陳公博昨晚廣播詞</h3>
<p>親愛的同胞們、國民政府一於本月九日宣布參加大東亞戰爭、對英美官戰了、這次宣戰不但是應全國人民的希望而宣戰、應東亞各民挨的希望而宣戰、而且是應百年來我們祖先的遺志而官戰、中國之淪爲次殖民地、是肇於百年前英國對中國雅片戰爭、自此中國沿海的要塞變了帝國主義的租借地、那是握住了中國的咽喉、中國膏腴的富地、變了帝國主義的租界、那是制住了中國的心臟、那還不算，還宣傳中國人種如何的卑劣、文明如何的低下、使全世界人類對於我們的國民不祇尋常的歧視、而且簡直常我們國民不是人、我們祖先以至於我們眞是含垢忍辱一百年、我相信同胞們懷念及此、刻骨不能志記的、</p>
<p>中國人民也曾屢次崛起反抗、最著名之役、要算庚子義和團祇可惜常日的人民國際知識還沒有充分把國際外交和帝國主義混而爲一、科學知識還沒有發達把反帝國中義的主張和迷信混而爲一、以致失敗了、庚子之役、中國更創巨痛深、我今天不是故意謳歌義和團的盲動、假使沒有雅片戰爭、英國强迫中國購食雅片、假使英國沒有越出國際外交以外、以侵略手沒對付我們、中國人民不會反感不會有義和團之變的、就是英美的學者、到今天還有許多著作、述及義和團之役、都歸罪於雅片戰爭、可見公道在人、犯罪者爲良心驅使、也不能不懺悔和自白、</p>
<p>辛亥革命也是爲反抗帝國主義而崛起的、當時同盟會各志士、眼見帝國主義侵略日甚一日、國勢日弱、時事日非、深知非排除帝國中義、中國不能獨立自由、更深知非先行國內革命、無由疆除帝國主義、祇可惜當日以實力未足、未能明揭打倒帝國主義主張、因此共和成立之後、轉爲帝國主義所利用、忙於國內的鬥爭和摩擦、於是辛亥革命的眞意義又告失敗了、民國十三年國民黨改組、鑑於以前種種失敗、知道我們要實行革命不息力量之不足而患主張之不明、所以雖在廣州一隅之地、實行揭起對內打倒軍閥對外打倒帝國主義的口號、主張旣已鮮明、國內遂如響斯應、一年之內統一廣東、民國十五年出帥北伐、民國十八年統一中國、祗可惜共產黨陰謀企圖顚覆國民政府、而英美復藉租界力量和金融政策、軟化蔣政府的南京、於是由打倒帝國主義的口號、突然變爲妥協、而日屈伏於英美帝國主義了、國民革命的眞正意義又告失敗了、自從前年日本發動大東亞戰爭、中國人民非常與奮、大家感覺到日本對英美之戰、是爲保衛東亞而戰、是爲解放東亞之戰、當時大家更感覺到中國是東亞的一員、我們也應當參加保衛東亞之戰、參加解放東亞之戰、這樣我們才無負於祖先的遺志、無負於本身的希望、無負於歷次革命的目的、無負於中國的光榮、更無負於日本發動大東亞戰爭的眞意義、汪主席首先代表國民發同甘共苦的聲明、而人民更努力於同甘共苦的實踐、</p>
<p>我去年曾在中央公論發表中國人民希望參戰的文章、十二月也曾作中國人民希望參戰的廣播、這都不祗是我一個人的意見、而是全國人民的意見、自前年十二月八日以後至於今年木月九日曾與我接談的金融界產業界農人工人商人軍人學界婦女、無一不以希望中國參加大東亞戰爭爲主題、可見中國對於希望參加大東亞戰爭、人同此心、心同此理、爲什麼大家要參戰、這是良心所要求、正義所驅使、這所謂成敗利鈍、非所逆覩、良心正義、求其所安、</p>
<p>中國今日已正式參戰了、我們求仁得仁、國民當有無窮的慰藉、可是親愛的同胞們，祇見心理的慰藉、是不够的、我們還得要有力量的表現、我們必須加緊訓練、加緊生產、中國人民的訓練還是不够的、一般地方沒有健全的組織、一般人民也沒有健全的組織，我希望現在我們應該加緊訓練、健全各地方單位的組織、務期做到國無游民、鄕無游匪、平常保衛地方急時出戰前敵、我們更應該加緊生產、健全各產業部門的組織、務期做到各盡其力、各展所長、內之足以給養後方、外之足以資送前綫、這樣才可以副我們參戰的希望、求中國的解放和自由、</p>
<p>我在本月十日曾在上海發表關於中國參戰的談話、說中國這次參戰、是實行國父大亞洲主義的遺敎、完成中國革命的目的希望我們訓練國民確立治安、增加生產、以圖目前之協力、更決然進一步以訓練旣成的人力、及增加生產之物力、以赴義之勇、求解放之鵠、我的談話意義、和今日對各位說話的詞旨相同、各位同胞們、我們現在下了宣戰的決心、更要提起凌厲無前的勇氣、不要以爲中國的力量微弱、我們有廣厚的資源、一舉手、一投足、都可以開發、都可以生產、往日種種不能自給自足、不過沒有盡人事罷了、我不信中國的糧食不够、我尤其不信中國的軍需原料無着、我們有的立刻開發起來、我們少有的立刻增加起來、我們眞沒有的、可以發明代用品、我們祇有肯去想、肯去幹、不但可以自怡自足、還可以繼續增加拿出來貢獻於前方、我們更有無窮的人力、有四禹　五千萬的頭腦、什麼不能想出來、有四萬萬五千萬雙的手、什麼不能做出來、中國有數千年歴史的文化、中國人民就有建樹數千年文化歷史的力量、同時就有發揚光大未來新文化的力量、中國人民在帝國主義壓迫榨取之下還可以開拓南洋、中國人民就有獨立發展東亞的力量、同時就有保衛和解放東亞的力量、我們祇有再努力、再苦幹、一定對於大東亞戰爭有　大的貢獻、建非常的功勛、</p>
<p>親愛的同胞們、中華民國的解放、在此一戰了、天下有耕耘才有收穫、換一句話、有努力才有結果、日本這次得着空前勝利、不是偶然的、我們這次和日木駢肩作戰、我們絕不應希圖僥倖、我們要解放中國必得拿出我們的眞實力量、大東亞有十萬的廣大民衆、具同一自求解放的要求、具同一打倒英·美帝國主義的目的、决其必定成功的、四萬萬五千萬同胞們、你們應該一齊起來擁護汪主席的主張、應該一齊起來參加解放中華民國和解放東亞的戰爭、勝利已在我們目前、我們邁進罷、</p>

<h3>甯夏行　西北高原荒涼寂寞　賀蘭山麓田壠青青</h3>
<p>陜甘道上</p>
<p>「西北工業考察團」自陝北同官等地回到咸陽以後，隨即起程赴寗夏，預備自、寗夏考察後，才入甘靑，一行十九人，坐了二部大卡車和二部小汽車，眞是一路浩浩蕩蕩，祇是風沙給坐卡車的人很爲難，不戴上風鏡和口罩固然吃不消，戴上亦覺怪不好過。</p>
<p>一路上山色土質並不比陜北好，中午到了邠縣，縣城在山和涇水之間的平原上，不很熱鬧，好像記得文王就是從這個地方爲犬戎所逼才徙居岐山，書上說文王對犬戎沒有抵抗，如果沒有櫃起的武王，恐怕黃帝子孫的情形就大不同了。</p>
<p>離開邠縣縣城不到三四公里地方，經過該縣所謂水簾洞一名勝地，其實並沒有見到水，祇是一個石岩上　了許多小洞，較大的洞裏也許還住菩薩和人罷了，再過去一個多公里，又有所謂大佛寺，倒不是虛有　名，一個很大的佛像藏在寺門內的大岩洞裏，雖說不如四川嘉定的大佛那慶大，但因爲是半身佛像，並且蒙在洞內，這視之下，也就覺得特別偉大了。寺裏的碑記說，大佛爲唐代彫塑，好像記得嘉定的大佛也是唐代鑿成，唐人太好佛，無怪乎我們的昌黎公在當時要大聲闢佛了。</p>
<p>離開大佛寺後，看到一段公路的旁邊，長着很大的楊柳樹，在深革都不容易見到的地方，忽見這麼大的樹，殊令人詫異，後來才知道，原來就是引得春風渡玉門」的左公柳，另外，父在路旁看到一帶長約七八里的棗林，葉和棗雖都已落盡，在棗林裏的農家，却戶戶尚在曝棗。</p>
<p>晚宿平凉，氣候顯得特別冷起來，晨起後，見到許多積水的地方都結了冰。到了上午八時，還見溫度表指　四十度，可說重慶最冷的天氣也不過如此。因覓汽車是日祇預備趕到固原，半日即可趕到，故上午大家都去皮作坊買皮手套皮衣之類，價格還算便宜，但大家以爲寗夏會更便宜，沒有多買，下午一時，才離開平凉。</p>
<p>荒漠景象</p>
<p>離平凉之後，愈走愈見荒凉，不常遇到人，却不時可以望見羊羣馬羣或牛羣，在山野裏自由自在的尋覓對草　嚼，而沒有牧人看管。牛羊在這種荒地裏，雖可以俯仰自如，却連枯黃的草都不容易找到吃，也該是不幸哩！汽車至和尚坡，平寗公路即和西蘭公路分開了。路基變得很壞，汽車顚播的厲害，有時且得涉水渡坑，五點半才到達固原，在黃昏中看到固原的高大的城牆。據說固原嘗爲回亂發動中心，故滿淸政府把城牆修築得很堅固，並有鎭台駐節，以資鎮壓。現在則只能見到城牆的高大，却連一家客棧都找不到，還是由於一家飯店盛情肯把店員們自己住的士坑讓給我們睡，我們才算找到「歸宿一。吃過晚飯後，因爲街市黑暗，只好爬上土坑　睡，生平第一次睡土坑，微笑裏走入睡鄉。</p>
<p>爲了當大要趕到中寗休息，早晨五時就起了床，猶是月明霜重的時候，雖住在一個縣城內，却大有「雞聲茅店月「的風味。晨七時，離開固原，小汽車因爲前途行不得，停留在固原，沒有再前進，大家於是都坐到大卡車上來行三十餘里至楊郎鎭，公路比前更難走，每小時只走了十五公里，祇及平常速度的一半。十一時經過山水河的時候，汽車陷在泥灘上，費了許多氣力，才能拔出來，沿途所見荒山禿頂，遠望如腸胃形狀，平原上則有許多巨大裂縫，儼如溪谷。德說地震造成的黃土斷層，有說是民六大地震，有說是民九，有說是民十四，莫衷一是。平原裏的土地都有耕種痕跡，却看不到任何作物，倘春夏經此，也許景色不同吧。見到的羊羣，比以前更多，牧羊人都穿着沒有布面的破舊老羊皮衣，似乎到了過去想像中的番邦，這地方　運貨物和騎坐，多賴驢馬，馬還强壯，縱使拖着重戰，仍然昂首前行，不像在四川的馬，老是垂頭喪氣沒有勁兒，驢在此地被使用得最多了，我們看到牠戰　人，拉着大車，馱着貨物，還拖着犂鋤耕地。</p>
<p>沿途看到的住宅，比在陜西看到的窰洞，在外形上又是若干不同了，遠遠望去，只見到個方形或長方形的圍牆，後來看到牆內現出一部份屋脊，才知道那圍牆內就是一人家，房屋都像鴿籠似的窰洞，有些圍牆竟築得像堡壘和城牆一樣，偶然也可看到一棟二棟宮殿式的靑磚綠瓦的房屋，但總披上一層很厚的灰塵。此地中年以上的男子差不多都蓄着鬍鬚，中年以上的婦女則多半戲着頭巾，小脚也還相當多。忽在一處聽叫「一批娘子軍」，我急往車外看，祇見士幾個騎在馬上的婦女很快的落到車後去，車子揚起的灰塵，使我沒有看得淸楚。</p>
<p>自從三原城下見到一次駱駝以後，在這一天幾次見到駱駝從車旁經過，每見到這昂首健步負重致遠的動物，總不期然要深深的望他們幾限，在沒有一株樹的荒漠地方，竟也看到過二隻鷹隼，這英雄似的禽鳥飛到這廢塘一樣的地方，似乎也减少了牠凌雲的壯志。沿途見到地面上露出很多的白色硝鹽，同行的化工學家不時的讚嘆起來。</p>

<p>自當局於本週初通告非經特許、一律禁止主要糧食運入滬區之後、據大美晚報記者探悉、當局將自南京採辦食米及其他主要食物、以增進本埠食糧狀况、據云因上海及其四郊糧食運輸之路道切斷後、官定米價可自由擬定、不致再受黑市之影響、</p>
<p>下期戶口米爲整米二升</p>
<p>向以轉販米糧牟利之滬市四郊如周家橋等處、若干非正式之米店、頃由主管當局予以封閉、旨在禁止其操緃黑市交易、並盼市民通力合作、穩定民食、關於滬市計口授糧數量、決予設法增加配給量後、據米業消息、兩租界各立的米店、昨日向米糧辦事處所領之第二十四期戶口糧買單、其配給之食米與麵粉爲整米與麵粉、惟數量與二十三期相同、各米店領價（一）食米每包三百元零四角、較上期領價每包减低四元、（二）麵粉仍爲九十二元、依此推算、下期授糧數量與本期略同、整米爲二升、麵粉一斤十二兩至二斤、但下期所配之米完全爲整米、並無碎米、關於發售時之確實數量及價格、尚待當局明後日之正式佈告爲依據、頃各米店准今日起辦理繳款出貨、本月二十一日起開始發售、至三十日为止、</p>

<h3>關於電車調整車資　公司當局談話</h3>
<p>邇來市民對於公共租界電車車資即將調整一說、頗爲關切、而外間傳說甚盛、莫衷一是、或謂車資提高、或稱車資抑低、中央社記者爲探明眞相起見、昨特走訪公共租界電車公司最高當局、據稱、此次調整車資、與歷决之漲價不同、已決定以本月二十日間開始實行、繼稱、所以決定調整之原因、乃爲廢除五分輔幣之麻煩、及修改站程長短之參差起見、新價目表正在付印中、</p>

<p>又訊、蘇州河北日海軍防區內之油糖配給事宜、因迄今尚未實行、故居民零購油糖、頗感困難、茲悉上週六該區保甲委員會開會時、已擬定辦法、短期間即可充分配給、大約在下月一日起、配給辦法可以實現、</p>

<p>去年十月以後三個月間，在展開於全華北之第五次洽安强化運動中，亦對於農產物之確保與物價之減低，特被强力倡議、可見糧食及物價問題，於當前之華北經濟，投有如何戶大之黑影。要之，物資與物價問題之解決，與對日貢獻資源之增產，可謂有不可分離之關係。</p>

<h3>Winter Relief and Food – The Two Major Serious Problems in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Since the weather in this city suddenly turned severely cold, with temperatures dropping below freezing, the result of just one night's northerly winds on the 11th of this month has led to countless deaths from freezing and starvation, a truly heartbreaking sight. Moreover, the number of those constantly struggling and moaning in the northerly winds and hunger is unknown, perhaps hundreds, thousands, or even tens of thousands. If it is said that all people have a heart of compassion, then all our citizens must not stand idly by when it comes to these fellow countrymen suffering from hunger and cold. In particular, wealthy individuals who spend thousands of gold on a single meal should ask themselves, how much of the waste from their singing and dancing can be saved to help hundreds and thousands of suffering compatriots. At the same time, it is hoped that the authorities and charitable organizations will earnestly carry out rescue efforts, understanding that saving one more life means preserving one more fraction of the nation’s vitality and saving society from one more fraction of crisis.</p>
<p>However, in addition to appealing for urgent relief for the poor people on the streets suffering from hunger and cold, we sincerely hope to draw the attention of the Chinese and Japanese authorities and social leaders in this city: the poor people collapsing from hunger and cold in the northerly winds today are the hidden poor who toiled hard yesterday but did not have enough to eat and wear. Currently, the food problem is particularly serious and deserves more attention. Recently, in order to regulate food supply and eliminate the black market, the Chinese and Japanese authorities have been implementing new methods for controlling food distribution since the 13th, prohibiting the transportation of food from the rural areas into Shanghai, and strictly banning private trafficking and hoarding. From the perspective of the authorities' food policy, this is comprehensive and leaves no gaps. However, considering the repercussions of this measure and the lives of millions of citizens, we in the media cannot remain silent.</p>
<p>What we wish to point out earnestly is that the current food problem is definitely not a problem of insufficient quantity, nor is it due to the wartime needs of Japan cooperating after the war, as generally speculated by the citizens. Based on the food production situation within a hundred and several tens of kilometers around Shanghai, it is not only sufficient for the people to be self-sufficient, but also has surplus to supply the needs of the local allied forces. However, how did the food problem arise? It arises from the manipulation of the market by a few people, as well as hoarding and speculation. Therefore, we fully agree with the authorities' new food policy, which focuses on cracking down on hoarding and the black market, while increasing the rationed rice per household. However, the following specific issues must be considered.</p>
<p>First, regarding cracking down on hoarding, since the authorities are aware that the rice harvest was not bad last autumn, but the rice prices in various places near Shanghai have skyrocketed, it is indeed due to hoarding, manipulation, and private trafficking. Therefore, the authorities are starting by cracking down on hoarding, manipulation, and private trafficking. However, we believe that any policy, like a doctor treating an illness, must first investigate the root cause of the disease, and then prescribe the right medicine to see improvement. How does the phenomenon of hoarding, manipulation, and private trafficking in food arise now? Obviously, it is still because the vast majority of citizens in this city need food, because the household rice that each citizen receives is not enough to maintain their minimum standard of living, so they have to resort to buying and selling in the black market. For example, if citizens can obtain a sufficient supply of tap water every day, there will be no need for hoarding. This is not a joke, it is reality. Therefore, we believe that all crackdown measures must be implemented after the food needs of the citizens are met.</p>
<p>Secondly, in order to implement the entire food policy, the authorities have adopted a unified procurement policy, prohibiting private transportation and trafficking by the people. In principle, this is beyond reproach. However, a very serious fact must be given special attention, that is, some Japanese merchants designated and authorized by the authorities to purchase food often use this privilege to suppress the rice prices paid to farmers on the one hand, and do not make efforts to help the authorities purchase enough food to reach the predetermined quantity on the other hand. Perhaps this makes the authorities feel that there is a shortage of food from time to time, and they have to restrict the import of food from various places near Shanghai and strictly prohibit private transportation and trafficking by the people. Therefore, if this authorized procurement system is not improved, it will not only hinder the completion of the authorities' food policy, but will inevitably increase the severity of the food problem.</p>
<p>Recently, the household ration for the twenty-fourth period has been increased, with each person receiving two *sheng* of rice and two *jin* of flour, which is naturally very good. However, according to the minimum amount necessary for each citizen's livelihood, it is still less than half. If citizens cannot maintain their daily lives with what they receive, and most families have no grain storage, they will inevitably turn to the black market and private traffickers. Even if the prohibition of black market and private trafficking is strict, there is still the worry of "taking risks despite the prohibition." As the saying goes, "Only when clothing and food are sufficient do people know honor and disgrace." Now that food is insufficient, the common people are ignorant, and even if there are strict orders, they are not enough to inspire awe. It is really impossible not to worry about the future of society. It is said that there is a plan to gradually increase the household rice to four *sheng* per person per period in the future, which may well be good news for the citizens. We only hope that it will be realized as soon as possible, because there are too many citizens who have no grain stored at home.</p>

<p>Key Points of Chairman Wang's Address</p>
<p>Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The key points of Chairman Wang's address at the Fifth Plenary Session, on the issue of participation in the war, pointed out the epoch-making development of the current situation, explaining that since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, comrades in the Party have advocated this. The decision to participate in the war this time is a unanimous proposition of the whole body, with no exceptions. It also explained that participation in the war is a decision made independently by China based on its position as a member of East Asia. The friendly nation Japan, on the day China joined the war, returned the concessions and abolished extraterritorial rights, which is not a bargaining chip, but based on the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty, taking the stance of East Asian comrades, to provide sincere assistance to China's independence and autonomy. As far as the situation of the Greater East Asia War is concerned, in terms of military and human resources, it has a definite grasp of victory. The most important thing in the middle is the unity of hundreds of millions of East Asian people. The root of unity is spirit. The reason why China can fulfill its responsibility for participating in the war and can become a member of the East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere lies entirely in this. This spirit is developed from the love of China and the love of East Asia, and cannot be manufactured casually. We should take the spirit of the New National Movement to shoulder the heavy responsibility of seeking China's freedom and equality and seeking the co-existence and co-prosperity of East Asia through the victory of the Greater East Asia War. In the past, we accomplished this spirit, and from now on, we should continue this spirit and strive forward for epoch-making development.</p>
<p>Finally, the Chairman spoke about the establishment of the Supreme National Defense Conference, and after the Supreme National Defense Conference decided yesterday to reorganize the administrative structure, Li Wenbin, Political Vice Minister of the Ministry of Interior, first expressed his willingness to resign as Vice Minister and retire as a Councilor, which was deeply gratifying.</p>
<p>The Chairman also proposed to the General Assembly to add Comrade Li as a member of the Central Committee to show encouragement.</p>
<h3>China's Liberation Lies in This One Battle – Chen Gongbo's Radio Address Last Night</h3>
<p>Dear compatriots, the National Government officially announced its participation in the Greater East Asia War and declared war on Britain and the United States on the 9th of this month. This declaration of war is not only in response to the hopes of the people across the country, in response to the hopes of all the people of East Asia, but also in response to the last wishes of our ancestors for a hundred years. China's fall to the status of a semi-colony began with the British Opium War against China a hundred years ago. Since then, the fortresses on the coast of China have become concessions for imperialism, which has grasped China's throat. China's fertile lands have become concessions for imperialism, which has controlled China's heart. That's not all. They also promoted how inferior the Chinese race is and how low its civilization is, so that the whole world not only discriminates against our people in the ordinary way, but also simply treats our people as if they are not human. Our ancestors and we have truly endured humiliation for a hundred years. I believe that the compatriots who recall this will never forget it.</p>
<p>The Chinese people have also risen up repeatedly to resist. The most famous battle was the Boxer Rebellion in the *gengzi* year. It is only a pity that the people of that day did not have sufficient international knowledge to confuse international diplomacy with imperialism, and scientific knowledge had not yet developed to confuse the anti-imperialist proposition with superstition, resulting in failure. After the Boxer Rebellion, China suffered even more profoundly. Today, I am not deliberately praising the blind action of the Boxer Rebellion. If there had been no Opium War, in which Britain forced China to purchase opium, if Britain had not overstepped the bounds of international diplomacy and used aggression against us, the Chinese people would not have been resentful and there would have been no Boxer Rebellion. Even British and American scholars still have many works today that refer to the Boxer Rebellion and attribute it to the Opium War. It can be seen that justice is in the heart of the people, and criminals are driven by conscience and cannot but repent and confess.</p>
<p>The Xinhai Revolution also rose up to resist imperialism. At that time, the comrades of the Tongmenghui, seeing that imperialist aggression was increasing day by day, the national power was weakening day by day, and the times were getting worse and worse, deeply knew that China could not be independent and free unless imperialism was eliminated. They knew even more deeply that without first carrying out a domestic revolution, there would be no way to eliminate imperialism. It is only a pity that at that time, because the strength was insufficient, they failed to clearly advocate overthrowing imperialism. Therefore, after the establishment of the Republic, it was turned to be used by imperialism, and they were busy with domestic struggles and frictions. Therefore, the true meaning of the Xinhai Revolution failed again. The Kuomintang was reorganized in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China. In view of the previous failures, it knew that if we want to carry out the revolution, we must not only worry about the lack of strength, but also worry about the lack of clear advocacy. Therefore, although it was in a corner of Guangzhou, it raised the slogan of overthrowing warlords internally and overthrowing imperialism externally, and since the proposition was clear, the country responded as if by echo. It unified Guangdong within a year, and in the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, it launched the Northern Expedition and unified China in the eighteenth year of the Republic of China. It is only a pity that the Communist Party conspired to subvert the National Government, and Britain and the United States used the power of the concessions and financial policies to soften the Nanjing government of Chiang Kai-shek. Therefore, the slogan of overthrowing imperialism suddenly became a compromise, and it succumbed to British and American imperialism. The true meaning of the National Revolution failed again. Since Japan launched the Greater East Asia War the year before last, the Chinese people have been very excited. Everyone felt that Japan's war against Britain and the United States was a war to defend East Asia and a war to liberate East Asia. At that time, everyone felt that China was a member of East Asia, and we should also participate in the war to defend East Asia and participate in the war to liberate East Asia. In this way, we will not fail the last wishes of our ancestors, the hopes of ourselves, the purpose of the previous revolutions, the glory of China, and the true meaning of Japan's launch of the Greater East Asia War. Chairman Wang first represented the people and issued a statement of sharing weal and woe, and the people worked harder to practice sharing weal and woe.</p>
<p>Last year, I published an article in *Zhongyang Gonglun* about the Chinese people's hope to participate in the war, and in December I also made a radio broadcast about the Chinese people's hope to participate in the war. These are not only my personal opinions, but the opinions of the people across the country. Since December 8th of the year before last to the 9th of this year, finance, industry, agriculture, labor, commerce, the military, academia, and women who have contacted me have all taken the theme of hoping that China will participate in the Greater East Asia War. It can be seen that China hopes to participate in the Greater East Asia War, and people have the same idea and reason. Why does everyone want to participate in the war? This is what conscience requires and what justice drives. The so-called success or failure, profit or loss, is not what we can foresee. We seek the peace of mind of conscience and justice.</p>
<p>China has now officially participated in the war. We have achieved benevolence, and the people should have infinite comfort. However, dear compatriots, it is not enough to see only psychological comfort. We must also have a display of power. We must step up training and step up production. The training of the Chinese people is still insufficient. There is no sound organization in general places, and there is no sound organization of the general people. I hope that now we should step up training and improve the organization of local units, so as to achieve that there are no idlers in the country and no bandits in the countryside. Usually, we defend the locality and rush to the front line in case of emergency. We should also step up production and improve the organization of various industrial sectors, so as to achieve that everyone does their best and gives full play to their strengths, so that we can supply the rear internally and send supplies to the front line externally. In this way, we can fulfill our hope of participating in the war and seek China's liberation and freedom.</p>
<p>On the 10th of this month, I made a speech in Shanghai on China's participation in the war, saying that China's participation in the war this time is to implement Sun Yat-sen's last wish of Pan-Asianism and complete the purpose of the Chinese revolution. I hope that we will train the people, establish public security, and increase production, so as to cooperate at present, and resolutely take a step further with the trained manpower and the increased material resources to seek the liberation with the courage of righteousness. The meaning of my speech is the same as the purpose of speaking to you today. Compatriots, now that we have made the determination to declare war, we must arouse the courage of being fierce and unstoppable. Don't think that China's strength is weak. We have broad resources, and with a move of the hand and a movement of the foot, we can develop and produce them. In the past, we could not be self-sufficient in everything, but we did not do everything in our power. I don't believe that China doesn't have enough food, and I especially don't believe that China has no military supplies. What we have, we will develop immediately. What we have less, we will increase immediately. What we really don't have, we can invent substitutes. As long as we are willing to think and do, we can not only be self-sufficient, but also continue to increase and contribute to the front. We also have endless human resources, with 450 million heads, what can't we think of, and with 450 million pairs of hands, what can't we do. China has a culture with thousands of years of history, and the Chinese people have the power to build a culture with thousands of years of history. At the same time, they have the power to carry forward and develop a new culture in the future. The Chinese people can still develop Nanyang under the oppression and exploitation of imperialism. The Chinese people have the power to independently develop East Asia. At the same time, they have the power to defend and liberate East Asia. As long as we work harder and work harder, we will definitely make a great contribution to the Greater East Asia War and make extraordinary achievements.</p>
<p>Dear compatriots, the liberation of the Republic of China lies in this one battle. In the world, there is only harvest if there is cultivation. In other words, there is only result if there is effort. Japan's victory this time is not accidental. We must never try to be lucky this time when we fight side by side with Japan. If we want to liberate China, we must take out our real strength. There are 100 million people in Greater East Asia, with the same demand for self-liberation and the same purpose of overthrowing British and American imperialism. We are determined to succeed. 450 million compatriots, you should all rise up to support Chairman Wang's proposition, and you should all rise up to participate in the war to liberate the Republic of China and liberate East Asia. Victory is already in front of us. Let's move forward.</p>

<h3>Hankou Branch of the Bank of Communications – Resumes Business on Schedule</h3>

<h3>Chongqing Implements Price Controls</h3>
<p>Bear, Fourteenth, Allied News Agency Wire: According to news from Chongqing, Chongqing is set to implement price control measures tomorrow, to curb the sharp rise in prices. The items subject to control are approximately one thousand kinds. The authorities, based on the market prices of November 30th of last year, have set price limits. The price controls mainly target necessities, such as food, salt, paper, cooking oil, fuel, cotton yarn, and cloth. The prices of vegetables will vary depending on the time and location. According to this new measure, the profit margin for merchants is limited to ten percent, leading shop owners to hoard goods in anticipation of engaging in black market activities. However, the authorities will organize economic police teams to inspect all shops. Any goods not marked with price limits, or those violating the price limits by engaging in black market activities, will be severely punished according to the law. The success of Chongqing's efforts to curb soaring prices depends entirely on its implementation. Economic circles express considerable skepticism about the effectiveness of this plan.</p>

<h3>Soviet Army Launches General Offensive, German Army Resists Strongly, Mobile Fierce Battles in Progress, Central and Northern Fronts Most Intense</h3>
<p>Berlin, Fourteenth, Allied News Agency Wire: Sources here stated last night that on Tuesday, the Soviet army launched new attacks in the Voronezh area, the upper reaches of the Don River, and the Leningrad, Ilmen Lake, and Ladoga Lake areas. However, the German army and other Axis forces resisted strongly, inflicting heavy losses on the Soviet army, destroying over a hundred Soviet tanks, fifty-two aircraft, and sixty-four heavy artillery pieces. According to Berlin Radio last night, a major battle has broken out in the area south of Voronezh. The Soviet offensive began with intense artillery fire but was crushed by the concentrated fire of German and Hungarian troops. The German military believes that the new offensive launched by the Soviet army on the Leningrad front is not a major offensive. The Soviet army is attacking from the Leningrad area while simultaneously attacking westward from the Volkhov River, but they have been met with determined German resistance and have failed to advance. According to detailed reports of these attacks, after intense shelling, the Soviet army attempted to advance across the Neva River south of Schlisselburg. The ice on the river was broken by Soviet heavy tanks. Soviet infantry launched flanking attacks but were repulsed by the German army. Only one Soviet unit crossed the river to the east bank on Tuesday night. German reserve troops launched a counterattack yesterday morning, which is currently progressing smoothly. German artillery inflicted heavy losses on the Soviet army and shot down thirty-six Soviet aircraft in intense air battles. In the Stalingrad area, after heavy artillery bombardment, the Soviet army again pressed towards German positions. Fierce mobile battles are currently in progress, with the German army launching counterattacks to clear out Soviet troops that have penetrated their positions. In the area between the Volga River and the Don River, the Great Don Bend, and the lower reaches of the Don River, the Soviet army repeatedly attacked the positions of German and other Axis forces but was repulsed after fierce fighting. Localized battles occurred on the central front on Tuesday. German troops operating in the Toropets area captured several dozen enemy soldiers.

<h3>Ningxia Journey: The Northwest Plateau is Desolate and Lonely, Green Fields at the Foot of Helan Mountain</h3>
<p>On the Shaanxi-Gansu Road</p>
<p>The "Northwest Industrial Survey Team" returned to Xianyang from Tongguan and other places in northern Shaanxi and immediately set off for Ningxia, planning to enter Gansu and Qinghai after surveying Ningxia. The group of nineteen people, riding in two large trucks and two small cars, was indeed a mighty procession. However, the wind and sand made it difficult for those riding in the trucks. It was unbearable without wearing goggles and masks, but it was also uncomfortable with them on.</p>
<p>The mountain scenery and soil quality along the way were no better than in northern Shaanxi. At noon, we arrived in Bin County. The county town is located on a plain between the mountains and the Jing River. It is not very lively. I seem to remember that King Wen moved to Qishan from this place because he was forced by the Quanrong. The books say that King Wen did not resist the Quanrong. If there had not been a rising King Wu, the situation of the Yellow Emperor's descendants would have been very different.</p>
<p>Less than three or four kilometers from Bin County, we passed a scenic spot called "Shuilian Cave" (Water Curtain Cave). In reality, we didn't see any water. It was just a stone cliff with many small holes. The larger caves may have housed bodhisattvas and people. A little over a kilometer further, there was also the so-called Dafo Temple (Great Buddha Temple), which was not just a false reputation. A very large Buddha statue was hidden in a large cave inside the temple gate. Although it was not as large as the Great Buddha of Leshan in Sichuan, it was a half-body Buddha statue and was hidden inside the cave, which made it seem particularly grand at first glance. The temple's inscription said that the Great Buddha was sculpted during the Tang Dynasty. I seem to remember that the Great Buddha of Leshan was also carved during the Tang Dynasty. The people of the Tang Dynasty were too fond of Buddhism, so it is no wonder that our Han Yu (Changli Gong) had to loudly criticize Buddhism at that time.</p>
<p>After leaving the Dafo Temple, we saw a section of the road lined with very large willow trees. In this barren land, it was surprising to suddenly see such large trees. Later, we learned that they were the "Zuo Gong Willows" that "引得春风度玉门" (attracted the spring breeze to cross the Jade Gate). In addition, I saw a date forest about seven or eight li long along the roadside. Although the leaves and dates had all fallen, the farmhouses in the date forest were still drying dates.</p>
<p>We stayed overnight in Pingliang, and the climate seemed particularly cold. After getting up in the morning, we saw ice forming in many places where water had accumulated. At eight o'clock in the morning, the thermometer still read forty degrees. It can be said that even the coldest weather in Chongqing was no more than this. Because we were looking for a car, we only planned to reach Guyuan that day, which could be reached in half a day. So, in the morning, everyone went to the leather workshops to buy leather gloves and leather clothes. The prices were relatively cheap, but everyone thought that Ningxia would be even cheaper, so they didn't buy much. We didn't leave Pingliang until one o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Desert Landscape</p>
<p>After leaving Pingliang, the landscape became increasingly desolate. We didn't encounter people often, but we could often see flocks of sheep, horses, or cattle freely foraging for grass in the mountains and fields without shepherds watching over them. Although cattle and sheep could roam freely in this wasteland, it was difficult for them to find even withered yellow grass to eat, which was also unfortunate! When the car reached Heshangpo, the Pingning Highway separated from the Xilan Highway. The roadbed became very bad, and the car bumped severely. Sometimes, we even had to wade through pits. We didn't reach Guyuan until half past five. In the twilight, we saw the tall city walls of Guyuan. It is said that Guyuan was once the center of the Hui Rebellion, so the Qing government built the city walls very strong and stationed a garrison commander to suppress it. Now, we can only see the tall city walls, but we couldn't even find an inn. It was only because a hotel was kind enough to let us sleep in the earth kangs that the employees themselves lived in that we found a "home." After dinner, because the streets were dark, we had to climb onto the earth kang to sleep. It was the first time in my life that I slept on an earth kang, and I fell asleep with a smile.</p>
<p>In order to get to Zhongning early the next day, we got up at five o'clock in the morning. It was still a time of bright moon and heavy frost. Although we were living in a county town, it had the flavor of "chicken crowing, thatched inn, moonlight." At seven o'clock in the morning, we left Guyuan. Because the small car could not go forward, it stayed in Guyuan and did not advance further. Everyone then rode on the large truck. Traveling thirty or so li to Yanglangzhen, the road was even more difficult to travel than before. We only traveled fifteen kilometers per hour, only half of the normal speed. When we passed the Shanshui River at eleven o'clock, the car was stuck in the mud beach. It took a lot of effort to pull it out. The mountains along the way were barren and bald, looking like intestines and stomachs from a distance. The plains had many huge cracks, like streams and valleys. Some said that the yellow earth fault was caused by an earthquake. Some said it was the sixth year of the Republic of China earthquake, some said it was the ninth year, and some said it was the fourteenth year. There was no consensus. The land in the plains had traces of cultivation, but we didn't see any crops. If we were to pass through here in the spring and summer, perhaps the scenery would be different. There were more flocks of sheep than before. The shepherds all wore old sheepskin coats without cloth surfaces. It seemed like we had arrived in the barbarian lands that we had imagined in the past. In this place, transporting goods and riding was mostly done by donkeys and horses. The horses were still strong. Even if they were dragging heavy loads, they still held their heads high and moved forward, unlike the horses in Sichuan, which always drooped their heads and were listless. Donkeys were used the most here. We saw them carrying people, pulling large carts, carrying goods, and even dragging plows to cultivate the land.</p>
<p>The houses we saw along the way were somewhat different in appearance from the cave dwellings we saw in Shaanxi. From a distance, we only saw square or rectangular walls. Later, we saw part of the roof ridge inside the walls, and we knew that there was a family inside the walls. The houses were all cave dwellings like pigeon coops. Some walls were even built like fortresses and city walls. Occasionally, we could also see one or two palace-style houses with blue bricks and green tiles, but they were always covered with a thick layer of dust. Almost all middle-aged and older men in this area had beards, while most middle-aged and older women wore headscarves, and there were still quite a few with bound feet. Suddenly, we heard someone shout "A group of women soldiers!" I quickly looked out of the car, but I only saw a few women riding horses quickly disappearing behind the car. The dust raised by the car made it difficult for me to see clearly.</p>
<p>Since seeing a camel once below Sanyuan City, I saw camels passing by the car several times on this day. Whenever I saw these animals that held their heads high, walked with strength, and bore heavy loads, I couldn't help but look at them deeply. In the barren desert without a single tree, I even saw two falcons. These heroic birds seemed to have also reduced their soaring ambitions when they flew to this stagnant pond of a place. Along the way, we saw a lot of white saltpeter exposed on the ground. The chemical engineers traveling with us couldn't help but praise it.</p>

<h3>Baojia System Aims to Secure the People, Not Suitable to Participate in Politics, Guidance Committee Held Second Standing Committee Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Mr. Shigeno, Director of the Baojia Guidance Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, solemnly stated yesterday at the second standing committee meeting of the Baojia Guidance Committee, in response to a proposal by a certain committee member, that the purpose of the Baojia organization in the Public Settlement is only to stabilize the people's livelihood and ensure public security. It is not appropriate to directly or indirectly participate in political activities, which would cause it to lose its inherent nature. He hoped that all Baojia cadres and staff members, from top to bottom, would adhere to this principle, strive to be in their respective positions, and seek permanent happiness for the people of the entire city.</p>
<p>Guidance Committee Held Standing Committee Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>According to reports, the Baojia Guidance Committee held its third standing committee meeting at 4:30 PM yesterday on the seventh floor of the Central Police Station. In addition to the standing committee members, over twenty district joint Bao heads or their representatives attended. Chairman Wang Lianfang presided, and Mr. Shigeno, Director of the Baojia Guidance Department, also attended the meeting to provide guidance. After the meeting began, a report was given on the progress of the publicity and fundraising campaign, including detailed reports on radio publicity, street publicity, charity football matches, movie star conferences, fundraising by various industries, and accounting matters. A concise explanation was also given on the establishment of the Baojia Self-Defense Corps. The attending committee members raised questions about the various reports, which were answered by the responsible parties.</p>
<p>Fundraising Expenses Did Not Achieve the Goal</p>
<p>The meeting also discussed the association's finances and personnel issues. In terms of finances, the fundraising efforts did not achieve the expected results. Regarding personnel issues, the selection of committee members was deliberated upon. However, due to the urgency of time, no resolutions were made. Standing committee meetings will be held once a month in the future, and unresolved matters will be left for discussion at the next meeting.</p>
<h3>Authorities Strictly Prohibit Raising Vegetable Prices</h3>
<p>With the Lunar New Year approaching, the authorities in the settlements believe that vegetable prices in various vegetable markets are bound to rise and exceed the price limits. There are already signs of this. Therefore, the vegetable market inspectors dispatched by the two settlements have intensified their inspection work. Many stall vendors who illegally seek extra profits have been found and punished. At the same time, it is learned that the Health Department of the Public Settlement has recently been particularly strict in inspecting the fish sold by vendors in various vegetable markets. Once it is found that someone is selling pufferfish, in addition to confiscating all the pufferfish, they will also be given appropriate punishment.</p>
<h3>Eight Military-Managed Factories Handed Over, Transfer Ceremony Held at Towa &amp; Co. Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Japanese side once again handed over eight enemy property factories under military management to the Chinese side. The handover ceremony was solemnly held at Towa &amp; Co. on North Sichuan Road at 3:00 PM yesterday, with representatives from the Japanese military authorities and the Chinese factory representatives attending. This is the eleventh handover since the National Government returned to the capital. Of the one hundred and forty military-managed factories, one hundred and four have already been returned. The fact that the handover ceremony was held again amidst the National Government's declaration of war is presumably of great significance. The factories that were handed over this time are as follows: Shenxin Textile Factory No. 7 (Shanghai), Huafeng Enamel Factory (Shanghai), Shanghai Cement Factory (Shanghai), Zhenhua Paint (Shanghai), Huafeng Enamel Factory (Shanghai), China Cement Factory (Nanjing), Minfeng Paper Mill (Jiaxing), Yangzi Flour Mill (Nanjing), Meifeng Textile Factory (Shanghai), and other eight companies. Among them, there are two textile factories, two cement factories, and one each of paper mill, flour mill, paint factory, and enamel factory.</p>
<h3>Public Settlement Police Station Dispatches Personnel to Investigate Illegal Radios House by House</h3>
<p>Regarding the crackdown on radio receivers, the authorities have repeatedly issued orders to register and conduct inspections of illegal radios. The deadline for registration is set for the eighteenth of this month. Starting yesterday, the Public Settlement Police Department has dispatched detectives from each police station to cooperate with Baojia heads to investigate house by house within their respective areas. If it is found that there are unregistered radios, they will be advised to register according to the regulations. If they are registered, the detectives will also conduct inspections.</p>
<h3>French Settlement Conducts Re-Census</h3>
<p>The French Settlement authorities have already completed the issuance of resident identity cards to residents within the settlement. Now, in order to prevent treacherous elements from hiding within the settlement, they have begun to conduct a re-census. Each police station will dispatch police officers to cooperate with Baojia heads to re-investigate house by house. Those who are found to have made false reports will have their heads of household taken to the station for questioning. Those who currently reside in the French Settlement without a resident identity card, or those who have moved from other cities without a citizen's certificate to prove their identity, should all pay attention.</p>
<h3>Bank of China and Bank of Communications to Handle Agricultural Loans, Commercial Banks Also to Undertake Loans as Much as Possible</h3>
<p>In order to regulate agricultural finance, the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications will vigorously restore agricultural loans in accordance with the regulations promulgated by the government, in order to support the production of various industries. All branches of the two banks can handle various agricultural loans locally according to the actual situation in rural areas. Agricultural loans are divided into: (1) agricultural warehouse loans, (2) loans for plowing cattle and farm implements, (3) loans for green seedlings. In addition, they will also undertake agricultural product transportation and discounting business. As for agricultural loans from various commercial banks, they have also decided to undertake as much as possible.</p>
<h3>Joint Meeting of Various Institutions in the Shanghai Rural Area</h3>

<h3>Business of Noodle Food Industry Gradually Declines; Association Advises Temporary Suspension</h3>
<p>Since the various noodle food businesses in this city followed the authorities' regulations and implemented the method of purchasing noodle products with flour, business has gradually declined. Recently, due to the authorities' implementation of a ban on the movement of food and the disappearance of black market flour, the business of these shops has shown signs of stagnation. It is learned that the cake and steamed bread association, in addition to requesting the authorities to change the method and provide relief, has also ordered all its members to temporarily refrain from announcing closures.</p>
<h3>Repairing Zhongshan Road in Western Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Public Works has observed that the road surface of Zhongshan Road, which is relied upon as a transportation route from Longhua to Zhabei District in this city, is severely damaged, hindering travel. It has drafted a repair plan and submitted it to the municipal government for approval, and will immediately invite bids for construction.</p>
<h3>After the Implementation of the New Food Control Measures, the Authorities Actively Purchase Rice; Rice Prices in This City Are Expected to Be Further Reduced</h3>
<p>Since the authorities announced earlier this week that the import of major food grains into the Shanghai area is strictly prohibited without special permission, the reporter of the "Great American Evening News" has learned that the authorities will purchase rice and other major foods from Nanjing to improve the food situation in this city. It is said that after the roads for transporting food to Shanghai and its suburbs are cut off, the official rice price can be freely set and will no longer be affected by the black market.</p>
<p>Next Period's Household Rice Ration is Two Sheng of Whole Rice</p>
<p>Several informal rice shops in the suburbs of Shanghai, such as Zhoujiaqiao, which profited from reselling rice, have recently been closed by the competent authorities in order to prohibit them from manipulating black market transactions and to hope that citizens will cooperate to stabilize people's food. Regarding the quantity of food distributed per capita in Shanghai, a decision has been made to increase the ration. According to rice industry news, the rice shops in the two concessions received the 24th period household ration purchase orders from the Rice and Grain Office yesterday, and the allocated rice and flour are whole rice and flour. However, the quantity is the same as in the 23rd period. The price received by each rice shop is: (1) Rice is 300 yuan and 4 jiao per bag, a decrease of 4 yuan per bag compared to the previous period's price; (2) Flour remains at 92 yuan. Based on this calculation, the amount of grain distributed in the next period will be roughly the same as in this period, with two sheng of whole rice and one jin and twelve liang to two jin of flour. However, the rice allocated in the next period will be entirely whole rice and will not contain broken rice. The exact quantity and price at the time of sale are subject to the official announcement by the authorities in the next few days. It is understood that the rice shops are allowed to handle payments and deliveries starting today, and sales will begin on the 21st of this month and end on the 30th.</p>
<h3>Authorities Actively Purchase Coal, and the Supply of Coal Briquettes is Plentiful</h3>
<p>Regarding the entire fuel problem in this city, since the authorities have actively taken appropriate measures, strictly managed the buying and selling of bituminous and anthracite coal briquettes, and adjusted the price limits, various illegal transactions seem to have been suppressed. Yesterday, news was obtained from the coal industry that the authorities are striving to enrich the coal briquette reserves and are very active in procurement work. Therefore, the amount of bituminous and anthracite coal briquettes transported to Shanghai from North China and Korea is continuously increasing along the way. It is understood that recently all kinds of coal briquettes are transported here by water, so it is still fast and convenient in terms of time and transportation. However, once the coal briquettes are transported here from the production area, they are strictly controlled and then distributed by the Da Zhong Lian Coal Company on a regular basis. As for the amount of allocation, it depends on the amount of coal used.</p>
<h3>Regarding the Adjustment of Tram Fares, a Statement from the Company Authority</h3>
<p>Recently, citizens have been quite concerned about the rumored adjustment of tram fares in the Public Concession, and there are many rumors from the outside world, with different opinions. Some say that the fare will be raised, and others say that the fare will be lowered. In order to find out the truth, a reporter from the Central News Agency made a special visit to the highest authority of the Public Concession Tramway Company yesterday. It was said that this adjustment of fares is different from the previous price increases and that it has been decided to implement it on the 20th of this month. It was further stated that the reason for the decision to adjust is to eliminate the trouble of using five-cent subsidiary coins and to modify the unevenness of the station distances. The new price list is currently being printed.</p>
<h3>Oil and Sugar Distribution Per Capita Has Been Concretely Decided, and It Is Rumored That It Can Be Implemented in Mid-Next Month</h3>
<p>Since the authorities implemented a rationing system for essential commodities, rice, grains, oil, sugar, cigarettes, matches, and soap have all been rationed. Recently, a reporter from the Commercial News Agency learned that, in order to strengthen the rationing mechanism, the authorities have decided to imitate the method of per capita grain distribution and distribute essential commodities per household to eliminate black market transactions. It is heard that the two main items of oil and sugar will be handled first. (1) Per capita distribution of edible oil is ready, and all specific measures have been determined, and will be officially announced by the authorities soon. It can be implemented in mid-next month. (2) The principle of per capita distribution of sugar has been approved by the military allocation authorities and is ready for implementation. It is rumored that a pilot project will be launched in Nanshi from the fourth period, which is February 10th. In order to prevent abuses during the per capita distribution, the authorities have carefully formulated sound implementation measures.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the distribution of oil and sugar in the Japanese naval defense area north of the Suzhou River has not yet been implemented, so residents find it difficult to purchase oil and sugar in small quantities. It is learned that the Baojia Committee of the area formulated a method at a meeting last Saturday, and sufficient distribution will be available in a short period of time. Approximately from the first of next month, the distribution method can be realized.</p>

<h3>Adapting to the Needs of Wartime Materials, Drawing up Trade Routes in Southeast Asia, Absorbing Surplus Materials in Southeast Asia, Supplying Daily Necessities, and Promoting Overseas Sales</h3>
<p>Shanghai is the industrial center of the country and maintains extremely close trade relations with various regions in Southeast Asia. Shanghai's main industries are textiles, tobacco, and flour milling.</p>
<p>Various Industries Have Sound Equipment</p>
<p>In terms of textiles, the spinning machines of Chinese, British, and Japanese factories have 2.69 million spindles, and there are also 30,000 silk looms. In terms of the flour milling industry, the production capacity of Chinese and Japanese factories is as much as 30,000 bags. In terms of tobacco manufacturing, the combined production of British, American, Chinese, and Japanese factories can reach 70,000 boxes per month. Other industries such as wool spinning, silk weaving, iron work, food products, and matches also have a considerable foundation. Shanghai has such equipment and can open up trade with Southeast Asia. After the trade between the two places is opened up, Shanghai can absorb the surplus materials in Southeast Asia to promote its industrial production. Southeast Asia can also promote its local products to mainland China and obtain supplies of daily necessities. As for transportation capacity, it is currently being expanded.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Remittances Concentrated in Shanghai</p>
<p>Shanghai is also the financial and trade center of China, and most of the overseas Chinese remittances are concentrated here. In the past, Shanghai was under the labor of Britain and the United States, so overseas Chinese remittances could not be used to adjust trade between various regions in East Asia. Now that the situation has completely changed, the result will be different. Before the war, the materials from Shanghai to Southeast Asia were leather, beans, miscellaneous grains, tea, tobacco, silk, cotton cloth, and cotton textiles. The materials imported from Southeast Asia to Shanghai were metals, minerals, medicinal materials, sugar, spices, pigments, wood, and rubber. These materials, in terms of today's wartime needs, are not without the risk of reduction and may even have a tendency to surpass the past.</p>
<h3>The Hangzhou Branches of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications Will Resume Business One After Another</h3>
<p>Mr. Sakuma, a senior advisor to the Central Reserve Bank, inspected the Hangzhou branches of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications and believed that it was necessary to resume business. Therefore, it was decided to plan to resume business. According to a reporter from the Commercial News Agency, the Bank of China branch is scheduled to resume business in Sanyuanfang in mid-March, and the Bank of Communications will resume business in mid-April.</p>
<h3>Crime in the French Concession Decreased Significantly in December; More Than 120,000 Residence Permits Have Been Issued</h3>
<p>According to a report by Mr. Feibo'er, the head of the French Police Department, the French Concession was extremely peaceful in December last year. There were no cases of murder, kidnapping, or fighting. There were two major theft cases, and other minor robbery cases and petty theft cases were less than in November. There were 61 cases of bicycle theft, which was also one case less than the previous month. According to the police investigation, eight bicycle thieves have been arrested, and twelve bicycles have been recovered. In December, a total of three people died in accidents, two pedestrians and one driver. The French side conducted inspections in various public places, hotels, teahouses, restaurants, and apartments last month, and as a result, 78 suspects were arrested.</p>
<h3>A Kidnapping Den Was Cracked in Wenlin Road</h3>
<p>Li Yinmin, a Chinese detective from the Criminal Section of the Public Security Bureau, detective Wang Zhenzong, and detective Yang Xinzhong cracked a kidnapping agency at No. 204 Wenlin Road in the French Concession in the early morning and arrested 15 criminals, male and female, and rescued the hostage. A certain wealthy merchant originally lived with his first wife at No. 2, Lane 665, Weihaiwei Road. Later, he took Ms. Xi as his concubine and lived separately in Kang Le Village, Fuxu Road. Since returning to him, Ms. Xi has given birth to two sons in a row, so she is more favored than ever. Unexpectedly, on the afternoon of the 4th of this month, four bandits suddenly broke into Ms. Xi's residence, kidnapped her, and demanded a ransom of 3 million yuan, and ordered Ms. Xi's family not to report to the police, otherwise there would be a risk of tearing up the ticket. So the family secretly did not report to the police. It was not until 1 am yesterday morning that the detectives of the Criminal Section received a secret report and rescued Ms. Xi at No. 104 Wenlin Road. At the same time, they arrested five bandits who were guarding the hostage and seized two fake pistols. Later, they searched and arrested ten criminals at No. 40, Zhonghua New Village, Maitheshurst Road, and No. 58, West Tenth Lane, Cade Road, and seized two real pistols and more than 6,000 rounds of ammunition.</p>
<p>The Capital Consumed Reached 70,000 Gold</p>
<p>A car No. 3555, which the bandits used for kidnapping, was found in a lane in Aivenyi Road. It was found that the capital consumed by the bandits in this case also reached more than 70,000 gold, because the house in Wenlin Road was newly topped with 18,000 yuan, plus the decoration and construction of a secret room for hiding tickets, etc., also reached more than 10,000 gold, and the cars and pistols were all temporarily purchased at huge prices. Except for one principal offender who is at large, almost all the major criminals in this case have been arrested. In the early morning, the police will detain them and send them to the Special First Court. After interrogation, it was ordered to be detained for re-interrogation at a later date because further investigation was needed.</p>

<h3>Different Choices on All Sides, Chinese Stocks Rise and Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese stock market fluctuated, with each stock rising and falling in rotation. Investors chose to absorb stocks that they had confidence in, so public utilities, cultural stocks, and department stores were all making upward progress. Chinese business stocks rose to a high of 42 and a half yuan in the morning, then fell 2 yuan. Zhabei Water and Electricity rose to 61 and a half yuan for the last transaction price, both rising 1 yuan. Commercial Press opened at 445 yuan, China at 165 yuan, and World Book Company at 107 and a half yuan, all rising 2 and a half yuan in a situation of short supply. Wing On Company was the most stable at around 130 yuan. Sincere again hammered at 140 yuan at noon, up 1 yuan. National Goods Company was around 77 yuan, up 5 jiao. Wing On Textile Factory was tired between 335 yuan and 40 yuan. Small denomination Great Light Weaving rose to 12 yuan. Hongsheng has returned a small 2 jiao and a half, around 8 yuan and a half. Greater China Weaving rose to 9 yuan, that is, returned to flat. Dasheng No. 1 saw a high price of 400 yuan, No. 3 was stable, between 350 and 60 yuan. Nanyang Tobacco, 122 yuan, returned a little to 20 yuan. Greater China Matches fell 2 and a half yuan, to 322 and a half yuan, with a small rise in the selling momentum of new and old stocks.

Zhonghui Bank rose again to 155 yuan, Shanghai Bank 700 yuan, and Zhejiang Xingye 730 yuan, all of which were buying prices. China United Film rose to 33 yuan, that is, returned to 31 yuan, returning a small 5 jiao. Most people's hearts on all sides are mostly upward, but they are actually suppressed by silver prices, and transactions are booming. The price list is recorded later.</p>
<h3>The Bond Market is Leisurely Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the public debt market was leisurely again, and transactions were extremely rare. Moreover, there was an image of being unable to approach between the selling and buying sides. Because there is no club, transactions must be searched for opponents, which is extremely difficult. Only Class C had a slight transaction, and its market price was 9 yuan, 7 or 8 jiao to 50 yuan, 0, 5 or 6 jiao. There was no news of transactions of other types, so it is extremely difficult to check their accurate prices. As the end of the year is approaching, or a vacation will be proposed.</p>
<h3>Military Tickets Rise Slightly, United Currency Falls Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, military tickets were firm, and the interbank price has risen to 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 5 points, 24 li. Small money houses and silver shops still received 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 4 and a half points, and sales rose to 6 points. The United Bank Notes fell another 3 points, and operators sold them for 3 yuan, 7 jiao and 2 points, and received them for 3 yuan, 6 jiao and 7 points.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the interbank interest rate of the Money Industry Association was 1 jiao and 7 points, unchanged.</p>
<h3>Fava Beans Distributed, Already 2,000 Bags</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the miscellaneous grain market was still embellished with bean cakes, and other transactions were lacking due to restrictions on movement. It is estimated that 2 cars of Kaiyuanlong bean cakes were priced at 94 yuan, 2 jiao and a half to 95 yuan, 4 cars of Fei Zi bean cakes were priced at 94 and a half yuan to 97 yuan, and 1,000 pieces of Changji bean cakes were priced at 95 yuan.</p>
<p>The miscellaneous grain group's distribution of fava beans has already distributed about 2,000 bags. There are still about 3,000 bags. All retail stores and fried food stores in the city can quickly apply for registration and request allocation.</p>
<h3>News of Tax Increase: Cigarette Prices Soar</h3>
<p>In the cigarette market, prices surged significantly but later slightly declined. Initially, lingering effects of the rumored tax increase continued to drive prices upward. Later, news that China Resources and Huacheng began distributing goods slightly eased the market sentiment. However, the resulting prices were considerably higher than the previous day. British American Tobacco's "Great Britain" brand reached $10,500, "Old Gold" $9,500, "Pinhai" $7,800, "Fairy" $7,900, "Wuhua" $6,800, Japanese "Golden Spear" $3,300, "Golden Mansion" $3,900, "Red Rose" $2,900, "All Green" $3,400, "Nian Zhi" $3,250, "Compass" $2,900, National Tobacco's "Beautiful" $5,650, "Golden Rat" $4,350, and "White Gold Dragon" $4,100, all showing increases.</p>
<h3>Daily Necessities Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>The market for daily necessities continued to rise yesterday morning. "Phoenix" matches were priced at $3,300, "Beautiful" $3,500, "Golden Tripod" $2,900, and miscellaneous brands $2,300. Candles: "Ship" brand $600, "Monk's Hat" $950, and miscellaneous brands $350. Soap: "Gu Ben" $615, "Bai Xiangmao" (white) $570, "Huang Xiangmao" (yellow) $515, and "Arrow Knife" $600.</p>
<p>The prices of medicines also rose, with headache powder at $34, Tiger Balm at $42, Bagua Dan at $36.50, Partridge Vegetable at $57, Lung Fu Ren Dan at $27, and Wu Ci (tooth) powder at $11.50.</p>
<h3>Spring Fabrics Active; Felt Gradually Declines</h3>
<p>Light spring woolens are actively traded with soaring prices. Due to production shortages at Chinese and Japanese factories, market stock is low. Buyers are keen to purchase as much as possible, while sellers are unwilling to release goods. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson's 135 flannel sold for $225-226 per yard. Hongkang's 456 Lamb Beauty sold for $152-153. Yongxing's "Jumping High" pattern spring woolen fabric sold for $205. Runfeng's "Lucky Sheep" pattern spring woolen fabric sold for $205. Military cotton flannel No. 1 sold for $230-240, No. 2 for $200, No. 3 for over $160, and No. 4 for around $90.</p>
<p>The felt market has been gradually displaced recently as other woolens have risen in price. Felt alone has reported price declines, making it the coldest item in the woolen market. The main reasons are the lack of sales to customers, a sharp decline in street sales, the popularity of plaid shoe fabrics for adult shoes, and the high price and lack of attractiveness for children's shoes. Furthermore, the majority of men and women now wear leather shoes, resulting in a three-quarters reduction in actual sales compared to the past. However, the lack of price regulation in the woolen price limit list and the weak market sentiment are also factors. Currently, the price of felt of various thicknesses and colors lacks any standard, and buyers are scarce. Grade 1 sells for $350-360, Grade 2 around $200, Grade 3 for $160-170, and Grade 4 for around $100.</p>
<h3>White Lead Wire Colors Uneven</h3>
<p>Both thick and thin white lead wire are currently in short supply. Although there have been continuous inquiries at the market in recent days, the unevenness of the white lead wire colors has resulted in buyers often being turned away. Prices, however, are relatively firm. Yesterday, coarse and fine mixed-color white lead wire was priced at $15,000 per ton. Fine color and high purity goods were priced at around $1,000 per picul. Genuine brand new lead wire is even scarcer, so market conditions are exceptionally strong. Currently, grades 8 to 15 coarse colors sell for $20,000 per ton, grades 16 to 20 mid-range goods for $22,000 per ton, and grades 21 to 25 fine colors for $25,000 per ton.</p>
<h3>Economic Trends in North China: Adjusting Materials to Lower Prices</h3>
<p>Entering the second year of the decisive battle, the North China economy, to assist the Greater East Asia War, has entered a stage of concentrating all efforts to increase resources for Japan. Due to ships and other factors, a part is still utilizing Southern resources, but after a certain period, North China's iron, coal, salt, cotton, bauxite, shale, etc., can be expected to increase further, which is particularly noteworthy. From the point of view of transportation, due to the efficiency of short-distance shipping and the strengthening of mainland land transportation, North China has now reached a guiding position in terms of increasing transportation conditions to Japan. However, regarding this trend, the actual production situation in North China is not optimistic. Furthermore, in terms of prices, due to the release of construction funds, the expected shortage of materials, and the clandestine activities of China's unique speculative funds, the Tianjin wholesale price index in mid-December of last year (according to the Joint Reserve Bank's survey, with the average of 1936 being 100) was as high as 671.69%. Among them, food accounted for 808.50%, and the cost of living index for workers reached 883.35%, of which food was 962.28% and clothing was 808.50%, all indicating exceptionally high rates. Regarding this price trend, the authorities have already been working to restore the price level to that before the asset freeze since July of the previous year, that is, 69.28%, and the workers' cost of living index to 246.5% (with 1937 being 100), by mobilizing all the staff of the Material Countermeasures Committees in various places in terms of both materials and prices, and continue their efforts.</p>
<p>During the Fifth Strengthened Security Campaign launched throughout North China in the three months after October of last year, strong advocacy was given to ensuring agricultural products and reducing prices, indicating the extent of the shadow cast by the food and price problems on the current North China economy. In short, the resolution of the material and price problems is inseparable from the increase in the production of resources contributed to Japan.</p>
