<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c1">日本國內改裝之完成與中國時局 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>國際局勢業已向大決戰階段邁進，德蘇戰塲，地中海的義英美戰塲，和西南太平洋的日英美戰塲，一天天向協同作戰的階段邁進，爲了加速世界舊勢力之崩潰，和世界新秩序之建立，不僅是西方的德義，芷在戰爭之外展開政治的和社會的革新運動，藉以集結歐洲各國人民之精神和物質的力量，打擊和肅清敵方的任何活動。東方，在太平洋上的國家，更需要由政洽和社會的活動，整肅起自己的一切力量，以配合決戰階段的需要，以打擊和肅淸任何方面的敵人的活動，建立起必勝必成的東亞大業。而且，要顧慮到時代是進展的，當東亞各國這種努力在進展的時候，敵人也在拼命推進其種種活動，因此今日的政治活動是現出競賽的恣態，誰能適應新勢態而施行新對策，誰不遲疑迂緩，誰就可以在決戰中站在優越的一端，攫取到勝利的錦標。</p>
<p>在這種新的形勢和新的要求之下，日本業已開始了國內的改裝，從事於國內諸體制之改組與改編，爲着新的事態需要新的機構與設施，日本當局已以極大的勇氣，開始國內機構的整飭，首先就是地方行政機構之改革，不久以前已有各地方協議曾長之任命，健全地方民意的組織，俾能發揚民衆協輔政府的效能，現在更進而努力於地方行政機構之刷新，以爲中央政治機構改裝之基礎，分全國爲九地區，任命睿智練達的地方長官，綜合調整地區府縣的行政，此種改革，從民間的設施方面言，農業部門，關於業已成立的農業團體法，已定於本月下旬公布其施行令，俾由此新組識的農業團體，以解決日本農政上多年來的懸案。工商部門，先於上月一日公布「商工經濟會法」，對北海道外七縣，頒令設立「商工經濟會」，並任命委員，其他各縣，亦將依次設置，期於九月中全部府縣設置完竣，十月一日起，此新機構即可開始工作，以推行官民合作之新政策。此外，如官制與人選方面，自地方以至中央，都已經或準備實施澈底的改善，務求其能適應新形勢而發生新效率。用中國人的說法，就是用新人，行新政，庶能在新事態下永立於優越地位而爭取大東亞戰爭中之勝利。</p>
<p>日本國內行政之改裝，從這次中央協力會議中，已可看到，確實達到了完成的地步了。從日本中央與地方行政之改裝，不禁想到中國的現局。說老實話，在我們中國的政治家看來，日本的國家組織，早已達到理想的健全程度，日本的各級行政機構及人選，早已適應戰局而達到理想的程度，而日本政府與民間關係之融洽，農粱工商各部門與戰時經濟政策之配合，也久被我們視爲模範，然而，隨着世界戰局與國際形勢之演進，爲着永遠立於不敗態勢，日本政府從未滿足其現存機構與原有人員，常作必要的改革，與整飭。一個國家之所以强盛，一個政府之所以爲人民所擁戴，正可從這裏找到根據。所有這些事實，難道不値得我國從政者反省與警悟嗎？</p>
<p>從目前中國的大勢說，由於日本在大東亞戰爭中犧牲奮鬥得到的勝利，由於日本對華新政策的實施，一般的說，誠然是令人樂觀的。但是試從世界大決戰階段，我國應負的使命說，從我國內情與本身的實力說，不僅應該感到慚愧，而且還應該惶恐吧！在大東亞戰爭中，我們會經在什麼方面盡了什麼力量？這個問題，也許有點難於置答吧？當然，我們政府和人民，在最近幾年來，在同甘共苦的原則之下，確實想與友邦協力，但從中國之建設及對大東亞戰爭之任務說，似乎誰也不能無「任重道遠」之感？政治方面，從中央以至地方，從機構以至人選，在當局雖已殫精竭慮，而實際上不能適應新形勢之需要，或不能確實達成其使命的，似乎也還不少。我國中央以至地方行政之調整，尤其是政府與民衆關係之改善及增進，似乎更常以此次日本國內改裝之成功爲模範，而需要細心研究，切實努力。</p>
<p>我國在目前世界大決戰中，特別是在大東亞戰爭中的地位之重要，是不待說的，誰也明瞭，我們當前對友邦對東亞的任務，不僅要集中國力協力戰爭，並且還有安定大東亞戰爭後方秩序，和展開生產建設運動以推進東亞共榮事業的責任。這種責任之實現與完成，一方面有賴於全面和平之實現，使全國一心一力以赴之，另一方面更有賴於國民政府及管轄下各地方政治機構本身之鞏固健全與靈活的運用，同時致力於人民心理之把握，以澈底改善政府與人民的關係，迭成向心的政治形勢，四億一心，担負起戰爭與建設的使命。現在渝共雙方重演內戰的傳說甚盛，當此眞相未明之際，我們不能遽下斷語，但是拖戰陣營內部弱點之暴露，以及全國人民要求公道與和平之心理必更迫切，未嘗不是國家民族的新生機，國民政府與全體國民誠能乘此振作奮興，改善政治，維護民生，則渝共統治下之民衆心理因之改變，向心政治形勢因之實現，不難使國內全面和平從速完成。</p>
<p>世界大局與東亞戰爭之演變，友邦政治改裝之完成，我國內部形勢之發展，都需要我們政治的澈底的革新，時乎不再，竊願國人共勉之。</p>

<p>梵蒂岡二十日中央社電　海通社訊：星期一晨羅馬空襲雖歷三小時之久，敎皇仍照當接　賓客，所接　者有紅花大主敎　卡蒂秘書大使及其他人員。</p>
<p>馬德里二十日中央社電　海通社訊：反軸心機空襲羅馬消息傳抵此間後，天主敎徒即在各教堂集合。爲此聖城及敎皇祈禱。據此間負責人士談稱：此項空襲，似將引動全世界天主敎徒對反軸心之公憤也。</p>
<p>里斯本二十日中央社電　路透社北非艾森霍華將軍總部特派員昨晚稱：反軸心第一次空襲羅馬，全係由美空軍之飛行堡壘。　放式　。米契爾式機及「刧略老」式機担任。飛行堡壘並無他機護送，米契爾及「刧略者」式機，則有閃　戰鬥機護送皆係隸屬於非洲西北之美空軍隊，解放式轟炸機亦無護送，則係隸屬於駐在中東由勃里萊登少將指揮之美空軍第九軍昨日第一枚炸彈，係於上午十一時十三分降認。</p>
<p>馬尼剌二十日中央社電　菲島三百萬天主敎徒，獲悉美機轟炸聖地羅馬後，極爲驚愕，均認美軍此種卑鄙行爲實爲人神所共憤，據教廷使節披耶尼稱，此種事實不僅爲弈島天主敎徒，即全世界天主敎徒亦大爲不滿，羅馬雖可　，　基徒教文化終不能被毀滅，美機之轟炸羅馬，已　露標榜人道主義之美國常爲達到目的而不擇手段之野蠻舉動，吾人必須斷然以正義申責。</p>
<h3 id="c3">義王及敎皇視察被災區 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>羅馬二十日中央社電　斯蒂芬尼社訊：義王愛麥虞限三世，曾偕　后視察羅馬昨晨遭受反軸心空襲之被災地區，義后並赴各醫院慰問受傷者。敎皇則於下午六時並不通知任何人，即偕同敎廷政務秘書處副處長蒙蒂尼自梵蒂岡出發，赴被炸毀之聖羅倫索敎堂及受創之凡拉諾公墓視察。</p>
<p>敎堂公墓成瓦礫塲</p>
<p>敎皇旣抵公墓附近，即可見轟炸之效果，有數處道路已成一片瓦礫，大學市亦有建築物數幢受創。在公墓外之方塲中，集有羣衆一批，彼等立即認出敎皇，並即向之示敬，敎皇在教堂之殘礫前下車，徘徊片刻、似頗傷感，蓋此羅馬最美麗敎堂之一，已無絲毫存在，門首已被毀，所有圓柱皆已傾頽，僅餘兩枝，其中一枝亦已傾斜，　蘭西斯齊尼所繪之聖愛蒂恩奈及聖羅倫索之葬體皆巳損壞，一一四八年所建之聖壇及大理石神座皆被毀，風琴亦被毀，凱旋門仍然屹立，但已受重創，本堂三座俱已無存，卞二世紀之敎壇亦被毀，故教皇庇護士九世之墳並未受損，但至聖所已受損，教皇登車後，即爲跪於方　羣衆祝福。</p>
<p>羅馬二十日中央社電　海通社訊：聖羅倫索敎堂，乃羅馬最古之教堂，建於紀元後三百三十年，當時乃由君士坦丁皇舉行奠基典禮，迄今已歷一千六百餘年之久，職是之故，羅馬敎廷曾於一九二九年堅持該教堂應歸爲梵蒂岡之治外法權財產。</p>
<p>軍警從事救濟工作</p>
<p>羅馬二十日中央社電官方昨晚宣告，反軸心空襲之主要目標，爲馬基奥萊及蒂布爾丁納兩處住宅區，該處房屋毘連，居住工人無數，據云蒂布爾丁納區受損極爲嚴重，聖羅倫索敎堂爲君士坦丁在羅馬所建立敎堂之一，亦已被毀，該敎堂內有已故教皇多人之墳墓，凡拉諾之天主敎公墓及其敎堂，亦被炸彈多枚擊中，醫院之一部份，亦受嚴重損害。昨日之襲擊，係在午前不久，警雜係在上午十一時發出，其後不久即有第一批反軸心轟炸機隊出現於羅馬上空，在六千公尺之高空飛行，敵機係分數陣不斷飛來，歷時約兩小時半之久，炸彈一枚落於距拉特蘭敎堂僅三百公尺之處，該敎堂爲敎廷所有，故係有治外法權者，該彈爆發後、四百至五百公尺以外之房屋亦爲之震動，若反軸心再向羅馬　　，則恐屬於敎廷而享有治外法權之建築物，如拉特蘭敎堂及聖瑪利敎堂等，亦將蒙受損害。羅馬受襲部份。景况凄凉，路面炸成巨穴，房屋被毀，仍在燃燒，路上死傷狼　，無家可歸老徘徊道左，大批軍警從事維持秩序，並組織救濟及建設工作。</p>

<p>日內瓦二十日中央社電　德國新聞社引此問接獲莫斯科消息，蘇聯軍界並不承認反軸心之進攻西西里爲開　第二戰綫。在莫斯科以英文出版之半官報「莫斯科新聞」謂，宣告進攻西西里即爲實現歐洲第二戰綫說，並不與事實相符，歐洲之眞正第二戰綫倘未成立，德軍指揮仍以東綫爲主，蘇軍亦絲毫不覺東戰塲業已緩弛。</p>

<p>柏林二十日中央社電　海通社訊：近日柏林方面均用「血磨坊」，以形容束綫之戰爭及蘇軍之重大損失。在奧萊爾迤北長三公里之前綫，蘇軍用步兵六師及坦克車多隊，以進攻德軍陣地，易言之，即每百公尺之前綫，有步兵一團，結果所有進攻成被擊退，每團蘇軍僅剩三十五至五十人而已。在米沃斯之劇戰。蘇軍企圖突破德軍防綫，亦受嚴重損失，蘇坦克車一百輛　擊德軍一師，結果損失坦克車三十九輛，在另一地段內則損失四十三輛，德軍陣地有數處被突破、但經反攻後，德軍立即克復陣地。奥萊爾東南蘇軍攻勢較弱，故德軍之交通綫乃得重行調整，幷解被圍之德軍一營，奥萊爾以北蘇坦克車數旅進攻，經反攻後德軍毀其車四十四輛，其他各處之敵軍局部進攻均未收效，德空軍活動，續使蘇軍遭重大損失。</p>

<p>以小食正恒氏爲團長之日本經濟使節團一行，自本月七日來滬與上海各方面中日人士會談，開誠交換意見，歷時六日，尤以　華方在野經濟人之交　爲該團重要使命之一，在鞏固中日二　經濟人之結合上，頗獲相當效果。使節團一行爲與國府諸要人就物價、通貨，交易等緊要問題，交換意見　見，於十二日午　九時搭車赴京、記者與使節團一行在車中，獲聞該團在留滬期問與中日兩國要人會談所得之結果，茲記小倉，明石，南鄉。寺四氏之視察談如下：</p>
<p>小倉正</p>
<p>自來上海後，首先感到現在中國最重要之問題爲物價問題。對此問題，業已聽取中日二國要人之意見，並似已在盡力研究業已對付方策。</p>
<p>其次，中國財界人士意見中，最重要者，彼等希　設定儲備券之最高發行限度，若此舉能獲實現，則中國財界人士可傾全力從事建設中國財政經濟。而所需資金，亦得以籌集。</p>
<p>至中國經濟之運營，似仍須用中國人之思想加以指導。日本必須研究中國之民族性，從經濟方面利用中國人所具之特殊性。</p>
<p>明石照男</p>
<p>此次與上海經濟界要人懇談後之感議，與大正三年隨澀澤子爵來華時之感想正復相同。當時與哀世凱政權之徐世昌氏會見時，曾稱日本雖已獲悉集中民族資本之方法，但無法　果資金，此在今日依然有同樣情形，蓋中國在今日資金與生產尚分而不合。因此。旣不能振興生產事業，復不能謀收囘資金。是以現在中國最所希　者，一　應培育强化　在漸上軌道中之金融機構，加以全面活用，並謀收囘離散之資金。</p>
<p>南郷三郎</p>
<p>就物資方面來觀察中國經濟界之現狀時，自大東亞戰爭發生以來，因與英美杜絕貿易所致之物資缺之情形，必須念行補充，以安定經濟。</p>
<p>在戰事進行中，欲於此龐大地威中補充物資，自爲困難問題，但大東亞全體之物資交流如能實行，則似屬可能，而此項全體的計劃，日本業已在研究草擬中。大東亞全境各種物資之數量價格二方面之調查，業已完竣，如利用之以謀現在之物資交流則維持通貨之行使，並非難事。中國之通貨問題，現亦正從此觀點加以檢討。交易營團自七月一日以來，已開始活動，但實際上將至十月後始行開始，中國聯營總會如能實現，則中日交易，將與該總會協同進行。</p>
<p>小寺源吾</p>
<p>中國紡織業業已進　世界的水準。故日本應將紡織業交由中國擔任，而日本則從事高度的精密工業。因此，日本紡織工業自應遷至大陸。爲謀吸收中國民族資本之投向紡織業方面起見，應該定中日二　人民股東差別之比例，使中國人方面較爲有利。</p>
<p>使用華中所生產之棉花，在上海紡織，就大東亞共榮　全體之觀點而言，似屬必要。關於獎勵種植棉花之方法，與其用補助金政策，不如採用提高收買價格，而以之計入紡織業成本中之方法。總之，屬於輕工業部門者，不僅紡織一業，全豁必須委之於中國人，向中國人顯示一種大目標，而使彼等有所希望。（翔：譯自七月十四日東京讀資報知）</p>

<p>渝方還有一種藉口，即使英美靠不住，然中國參加大東亞戰爭、靠得住雜得到解放嗎？這種藉口　我們從前已經以理論來解答，如今更將以事實來解答，自從今年一月九日以來，友邦日本和我們訂立協定，把我們百年以來求之不得的收囘租界撤消治外法權付之實行了。這原是中日關係基本條約第七條所的束的，如今提前付之實行，先把北京夭津漢口廣州杭州蘇州厦門各處專管租界交還，到了昨日，谷大使又和外交部褚部長將上海公共租界交還的協定簽了字了，這是友邦日本援助中國，完成其獨立自主的多年願望，最切實的證明。我想江蘇同胞，應該特別記得，上海公共租界怎樣成立的呢。因爲太平天國占了南京蘇州，前淸知道敵不過他，所以借助英國，來了戈登的洋槍隊，幫他打敗太平天國，因此以上海租界作爲報酬，從此之後，上海公共租界，就成爲東南各省乃至全國的一個大缺口，把中國的血，滔滔的從這缺口流到了英國裏，　於次殖民地的現象。我知道各位同胞，聽見了交還上海公共租界的消息，沒有不激動的，那麼渝方所散佈的藉口，眞是不値一駁了。我更要向各位同胞說明，友邦日本爲什麼這樣的做法，因爲束亞共榮，本是最高的理想，最近更因爲中國協力大東亞戰爭，加速了這理想的實現。中國的獨立自至，就中國來說，是中國要成爲東亞共榮圈內一個有力的國家所應有的要求。就日本來說，中國這種的要求，也正是日本所希望，因爲日本在東亞共榮圈內，得一個有力的同伴，較之得一個有氣無力的同伴，要好得多。因此日本視中國之獨立自主不只同情，而且關切，直是視如己事、所以纔有這　的做法，　固然不是表面文章，尤其不是權謀術數，不但政治如此，即經濟亦如此。今日的大東亞戰爭是全東亞的生死存亡關頭，全東亞民族，只有一條路，以共苦求同甘，以共死求同生，明白了這一點，渝方虛僞的藉口，將因事實的答覆而自然堵塞，我不僅盼他們堵塞，尤其盼他們覺悟，因爲根於理論的事實，是最能使他們覺悟的。</p>
<p>以上把大東亞戰爭的正義方面，說明白了我還想就形勢方而說幾句話。</p>
<p>各位同胞，是不是對於大東亞戰爭勝利的前途，還有懷疑呢？我以爲不用懷疑的，大東亞戰爭必勝不敗，決然無疑，因爲大東亞戰爭，顧名思義。是東亞民族保衛東亞的戰爭，我們並沒想到越過大東亞的節圍、去歐洲侵略英國，去美洲侵略美國，是英美要把東亞做他們永久的次殖民地，才越過歐洲美洲的範圍，來抓住不放。所以這次戰爭，在正義上，我們是以　討逆，在形勢上，我們是以逸待勞。大東亞戰爭開始以來，友邦日本，已經把英美在南洋及東太平洋的力量，驅除乾爭，所有根據地、一槪佔據，從今以後只要東亞民族團結一致，英美決沒有力量苒來恢復，英國自從大戰以來，土盜瓦解，眼見連印度也岌岌難保，其不能顯及東亞，人所共知，美國要由三藩市運三四百萬的大兵越過五千海里的大洋，前來決戰，也是不可能，至多拿飛機潛艇來騷擾或是拿少數兵佔領一兩處無關重要的島嶼，這是於大局無決定的影響的，明白了以上所說的形勢，可知道大東亞戰爭，虞是大東亞戰爭，只要全東亞民族團結一致，必勝不敗決然無疑。</p>
<p>各位同胞，我今日在淸鄉二週年紀念的時候，說明淸鄉與大東亞戰爭之關係，各位同胞，努力於淸鄉，就是努力於大東亞戰爭之一稱重要工作，保障治安，以安定大東亞戰爭的後方，增加生產，以培養大東亞戰爭的資源，以刻苦耐勞勇猛精進之精神，担當一切。在戰爭期間，痛苦是不免的，不但戰敗國如此，戰勝國也如此。即中立國亦如此，可以說當今之世，沒有一個人可以免痛苦，只要看如何忍受如何克服，我們旣然下了決心以共苦求同甘，以共死求同生，那麼光明就在目前。</p>
<p>我如今總括一句話，我今日爲紀念淸鄉二週年而來，我首先感謝友邦將士的鼎力援助，我同時感謝李省長及淸鄉同志各界同胞之同心共濟，我誠心祝禱各位將士各位同胞同志之健康及成功，我熱烈大呼中華民國萬歲大東亞戰爭完遂萬歲，大東亞民族解放萬歲。</p>

<p>本市近日盛傳將有臨時市參政會之設立，茲據中央社記者向有關各方探悉，目前絕無其事。良以租界接管，關於組織，人事，文卷，經費，工作等等，交接極爲繁忙，故目前當局尚無暇及此，更無派人籌備或聯絡之舉。惟聞當局對市民意志極願採納，民意機關原則上當予設立，擬俟租界接管具有頭緖後，再行　議。</p>

<p>愛，瀰漫在殘廢院</p>
<p>殘廢部由分男女二部，各有六十人左右，分佔着自成院落的幾幢洋房。女殘廢部，在比較蔭暗一些的平　裏，有的不過十多歲，有的是上了年紀的老嫗。穿着一式的靑衣衫，都在縫　着什麽，粗　不像是殘廢者，有幾個眼睜睜的望着參觀者，據說實際上她們什麽也看不到。男殘廢部，被集中在一大間房子裏，好像正等候開飯那樣。他們殘廢的程度都較重，有一個人的頭，被用木架撑住，據說不然就會倒掛在背上，多麽可怕。有一個面目淸秀的十七八歲的少年，兩條腿已不知給誰奪去了，記者和他說起他的身世，他哽噎着說不下去，眼淚不自禁地掉了下來。</p>
<p>施醫院一瞥</p>
<p>新普育堂的施醫部，是三個分隔着的院落。病嬰部，由于多間新修葺的平房，圍成長凹字形，房屋建築，病孩小鐵床等，都合於醫療的需要，病孩自初生至二，三歲的都有，不少是患的不治之症，但只要一息尚存，明知不救，她們還照樣調養着，和自己的兒女一樣，常常在門口拾到的棄嬰，有了很重的病才被拋棄的，經她們療養好的竟也不少。可惜社會上無力而拋棄兒女的事太多，新普育堂的資力却有限啊。</p>
<p>除了留院調養的之外，每天還開設門診和施藥，夏天來了，新普育堂的施醫院又成爲最熱鬧的淸患者的集散地了。</p>
<p>義務學校和廚房</p>
<p>救濟精神上的飢荒，也是新普育堂事業之一，除了對堂內孤兒實施分班敎育之外，另設平民義務學校，免費敎育一班貧苦兒童，可惜所辦事業旣極廣泛，而經費時貧不繼，所以義校的規模不大，還有待於改善與擴充。</p>
<p>爲了明瞭給養情形，最後又去參觀大廚房，那裏正有外國姆姆在調製麩皮麵條。二三丈長的大龜，正煮看晚膳。粥糊和菜乾湯。據說，嬰兒，孤兒和病人的食料比較最好。普通留院者早晨吃粥，中午吃飯，晚上是粥糊之類，菜肴除了小孩病人之外，早上每人一條　葡乾，中午有靑菜類少許，晚間有菜湯，雖然極力節約，但只以中午一羹，就得吃去六大鍋飯，（每鍋可煮米五斗左右），維持一千人的生活，眞不是一件容易的事哪。</p>
<p>據姆姆們說該堂人口共一千零三十六人，以一千人計，每月開支，計食料一百五十石，煤球十噸，柴九十担，蔬菜一百二十担，鹹菜類二十四担，豆油四百五十斤，鹽六百斤，醬油一百五十斤，火油五聽，肥皂五箱，馬料六百斤，水費約二千餘元，工資約一千元，其他病人，施診給藥，以及衣着、悠繕、雜項消耗等更無從估計咧。</p>
<p>困難與希望</p>
<p>新普育堂的事業，自救濟乳嬰至八十歲以上的了孤老，從敎養到醫療，規模宏大。因此，經營上特別困難，所費經費也特別多。以三十一年全年實際支出論，共達八十四萬九千零七十五元，現在百物昂貴，每月總得十多萬元。收入方面，主要的只靠姆姆日常勸募，如三十一年總收入八十一萬九千八百十一元中，即佔六十三萬五千三百七十三元之鉅。然逐日勸募，收入不固定，其困難自極明顯。去年上海市貧病救濟協會成立以後，該堂曾申請補助，經　菊村　柏雲二委員調查，本年春又經紀　綱委員前往調查，第一次決定每月補助二萬元（自三月至五月），六月間又曾一次補助六萬元。然以物價續漲，食糧時吿匱乏，堂內收容者已至無可再行遣散地步，爲了支持這一個無吿者的　　，爲着維護規模宏大成績卓著的新普育堂，希望各界給與更有力的援助。（完）</p>
<h3 id="c30">鎌田大佐講　制霸七大洋 <a href="#c30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>— 葉偉</p>
<p>昨（廿）日爲友邦日本第三屆海之紀念日，日駐華艦隊報道部長鎌田大佐，於國際劇塲演講，以「完遂制霸七大洋之偉業」爲題，力言國家之興替　胥視海上支配力之消長，言論精達，茲錄其滇詞於後：</p>
<p>自大東亞戰爭勃發以來，日本全國一億國民，對於海洋之關心，更爲深切。在吾大和民族生爲海洋民族之自覺下，更深切認識海洋之重要性，鞏固完遂制霸七大洋偉業之決意，今日欣逢第三屆海之紀念日，尤感意義深長。</p>
<p>海之紀念日意義</p>
<p>在此次大東亞戰爭，我海軍已完成如何之任務，又其作戰行動如何，以及獲致曠古之戰績，諒各位所共知，毋庸贅述，而綜合戰果之基礎，乃建築在支配戰域內之海洋也，吾人爲海洋民族，必須時常認識海洋之重要性。而前年制定「海之紀念日」之宗旨，亦在於此，故最初先申述「海之紀念日」之意義，在地球上，海之而積，達陸地之二倍半，此廣大之海洋爲巨大船舶能自由　少之交通路，抑且其中藏有無盡之資材珍寳。</p>
<p>眞正海洋民族之國家，以國內工業發達及對外貿易繁盛爲必須條件，蓋工業之振興發達，必須考慮水運之便利，因此必須海運，又須謀航路安全及船舶建造。於茲即需要伸長海權，保護　權，確保軍事上要地，並必須獲得殖民地，苟完備產業，水運，海權，殖民地等之連　事項，始能完遂海洋國家之發展，以上四項，缺一不可，我日本帝國欲發展爲生於海之國家。非支配海洋則不可，而支配海必須認識海，即使生活之總根據爲陸地，但亦不可不深切認識海，海不但爲陸地根據之保護，且爲與外國交通之公路及極橋樑，僅以海爲防禦工具之一的民族國家，則決無發展爲眞正生於海之國家，而欲謀國家之發展興隆，不論承平時代或戰時，必須振興國內產業，大量建造船舶，及存有强力海軍及基地（殖民地）設施，如在戰時，則國內產業全部改變目標爲增强軍需生產，時至今日，更被力主增强生產，若就海運而言，大東亞戰爭，其戰域之龐大，在歷史上確屬空前，且必須依賴海運，因而運輸陸軍，及兵器軍需，所必要之商船，其數量亦非任何國家可比，故大東亞戰爭爲依賴海軍與商船「結合」之巧妙的「協同行動」，而於適當時間載運將兵至適當地點，如此以獲得之土地爲基地，加以開發利用，更於該地謀增產物資。海陸戰與建設戰相輔並進，是故，此次戰爭之第一要義爲船，第二亦是船，第三仍是船也。目今已迫近緊急造船之時機，敵方英美，曾誇張宣傳稱，日本之弱點在缺少商船，日本遲早將因商船而屈服云云。</p>
<p>日本海洋發展之回顧</p>
<p>以上已概述支配海之要件，今日我日本在天皇威稜之下，由於皇軍將兵之營謀　戰，佔領較本國面積龐大數倍之領土，正發展爲自古未有之海軍國家，於茲試囘顧建國以來我國海洋發展之狀况，以資將來之敎訓，神武天皇即位時，宣吿稱「兼六合以聞都，掩八絃以爲字，」此實宣揚海洋大發展之大精神，其後吾大和民族，繼承此海洋發展之大精神，對內則擴充秤與開發，對外則經營發展，迨至第十代崇神天皇下諭造船，「船者天下之要用也，今海邊之民，由無船以甚苦步運，其令諸國俾造船舶，」獎勵海洋之發展，第十四代仲衣天皇出師外征，神功皇后親征三韓，堂堂渡洋作戰</p>
<p>結論　日本海洋發展之歷史，已如上述，然僅研究歷史，則感覺興味而已，無補於實際，應在其理解認識之下，普及實踐的興味，吾人須有此種常識，即日本國民之生活，一半以上處於海上，易言之，必須以海連結於日常生活，無論旅行或娛樂，俱應利用海洋，德國元首希特勒，以海外旅行係屬富有階段之專利物，爲使貧窮之勞工，亦能享受低廉愉快之海外旅行，特建造船舶數艘，以供駛往北歐地方巡迴旅行，但此點被世人稱爲挪威作戰成功之主要原因，由是觀之，不論大陸國家抑或海洋國家，俱不能離海而生存</p>

<p>什麽是戰時經濟意義？就是從戰時一切經濟立塲上來觀察環境，測騐前途，須要抱着一種特殊的見地，遠大的眼光，——不是尋常的，淺近的。</p>
<p>所謂特殊見地，遠大眼光，簡單地說，就是要明切認識戰時經濟政策的精神與關鍵所在。「戰時經濟政策綱領」不是早就吿訴我們嗎？第一要增加生產，第二要調劑物價，第三要節約消費。</p>
<p>可是，在居於全國經濟核心地位的上海，偏多淺薄之徒，尤其是非法勝利的一般人們，其戰時經濟意識是過份淺薄的，以爲戰時是天賦給他們的一個發財機會；人人抱着「渾水撈魚」和「乘火打刧」的思想，因此，在表面上，——爲了沽名，——什麽好的事情，都肯去做；在事實上，——爲站發財，——什麽好的事情，都不肯去做。結果：一面侈談增加生產，一面拼命於原料的囤積，徒使生產瀕於絕境；一面參加經濟統制，一面參加投機者的盈餘分配，甚至直接經營投機，徒使物價高漲，漫無止境；一面響應節約運動，一面揮金如土的度其　奢淫佚的生活，從以助長人民貶視國家通貨的心理。</p>

<h3 id="c46">舊話重提談節約 <a href="#c46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>— 健揀</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭，已經一年半了，到今天才談節約，不是一件光榮的事，但今天的節約運動，是在一種新的環境新的意義下提出的。自然要有一種新的力量使它發來東來。</p>
<p>新的環境是什麽？因戰時的原因，上海及各地的社會經濟力量已不比從前了。</p>
<p>新的意義是什麽？目前是歷史上空前的困難時期，國民經濟是在一種最困苦之試鍊中，節約之意，自更深切了。</p>
<p>新的力量是什麽？有目前的極高度生活困難程度中，關於節約，大家都有切膚之痛，若發展開來，自然會獲得大眾眾心底發出來的贊同的。</p>
<p>上海，已成一個消費的上海了。富與貧各成極端。「朱門酒肉自路有凍死骨」猶不足以形容今日上海之畸形，我們的節約運動之對象，不是那　「今日不知明日糧」的朋友，他們已無可節約了，而主要地是那般暴發戶的冒險家，「吃喝不厭的珍饈佳釀，聽看不膩的音樂歌舞，遊覽不倦的花園舞池」中的「高等華人」以及中層社會諸般人士，前者，節儉一夜，足能救活數條人命：後者，尚可節約，裨益國家。上海不泛深明義理之士，助己益人之節約運動，想必能以身作則領導民間，則風氣之成，指日可待。</p>
<p>我們曾提出「淸新簡樸」的口號，以去除奢侈靡貴的惡習。轉移風氣，養成一種新的朝氣，這是最重要的地方。</p>
<p>其次，我們以爲節約，也有消極和積極之分，先從衣食住行談消極節約：</p>
<p>衣的方面：聞蕭亨先生講得好：「衣着的眩耀，並非表示人品的高下的，下等的人穿了長衣還是下等的，上等的人雖穿短衣總還是個上等人。」決定不做新衣，先把舊的穿完再說，如沒有長衣。僅穿短衣亦可，這是闌老的開明之見，「半絲半縷恆念物力維艱」這句話，是對今日的我們說的。申報社論曾云「夏季四裝不穿上裝，不用帶結，如香港衫等即應視爲理想而合理的夏裝，中裝則提倡布衣短衫，還有破衣破鞋。只要補綻淸潔，即不失體面，且應受人尊敬，女子的華服盛裝，特別是奢華的飾物，應被視爲不正當職業女子的特殊標識」，這幾句話，實有再請大家注意的價値。</p>
<p>食的方面：「一粥一飯當思來處不易」，「富人一席飯，災胞十條命。」不僅自己這樣想，還要敎孩子這樣想，珍饌佳釀來招待客人，應被認爲一種良心的恥辱，婚喪酒席方面，也儘可能地節約，若能以之充作社會善舉，那更有積極性了，我國人食事大都只求其味而不談營養，這也需予以糾正，希望專家對雜糧及低廉蔬菜的營養價値指導市民。</p>
<p>住的方面與行的方面：不求華麗的住房，去除紳士式的頭飾車頑習，有用人的，略予減少，各事自己不妨也動動手，此外，林柏生氏的剃光頭，上海靑年，實可提倡，其實，剃光頭者，反能見其英邁之氣。</p>
<p>古人云：「貸悖而入者，亦悖而出，」囤積居奇之輩，橫財旣多，則舞塲酒家及一切娛樂消夜之所自必客滿，簡約之風若能推廣到這批人中，才可說有所成效，而要點仍在社會風氣的轉移，風氣旣移，自能影響到他們。</p>
<p>以上各點，均係個人的節約，推己及人，由個人經濟的節約並到國民經濟的節約，這樣節約才有積極的意義。其關鍵在於各界領袖的積極倡導，公生活與私生活始終一貫堆服腐。政府要人，工商領袖，首先實行，打破日長月久的靡奢威俗，勇於倡導，才有辦法。不僅物資，時間也要節約。學校當局，更應在校中首先轉移風氣，使朝氣與簡約並行，使之成習，則學生們畢業後進入社會，必能起重大作用。</p>
<p>向來節約的另一年，即爲勤儉。勤字今日的解釋是增進生產，儉字是節省物資。所以節約的另一面，必需是增加生產，目下的上海是消費過大生產太少了，原料燃料食糧三問題當局若能妥爲解決，生產便可大事恢復，否則，僅是節約，還是消極的。</p>
<p>總之，一面增進生產，一面推行節約，積極與消極並進，國民經濟始有裨益，而唯有堅强的國民經濟，方能挿足於世界經濟中，而發揮出其國民的力量來。</p>

<h3 id="c47">文學創作精義 <a href="#c47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>— 應遷善</p>
<p>文學以創作爲中心，亦以創作爲出發點，所以研究文學對於創作應有的基本培養，必須深刻明瞭</p>
<p>（一）文章的可貴，以於創作者情感的充沛，思想的眞摯，所造成的因素爲第一義，這是必然的現象，往往一篇絕好的作品——不論是詩歌，是戲曲，或小說，或散文，——它不但能陶怡性情，激發志氣，同時亦能使讀者蹙然以驚，默然神往，譬如像岳武穆滿江紅中說：「壯士饑餐胡虏肉，笑談渴飲匈奴血，待從頭收拾舊山河，朝天闕。」它這種詞句的痛快激昂，確可引起讀者的喜極欲狂，眞所謂始而拍案，紀而撫脾了。</p>
<p>此外尤其是描寫景，物的文章，更需要極其眞相，曲盡其妙，曾記得梁任公先生有一闋詠櫓（竹竿做成行駛時所用，）的詞牌說得很好：「憶當年絲鬚娑婆，自歸君年，靑少黃多，歷盡幾多磨折，受盡多少風波，莫提起，提起來沽淚滿江河。」悱側動人，可以想見。</p>
<p>（二）無論寫長篇或短篇的作品，都須側重含義，和發揮，大凡一般人的寫作，當有二種弊病：一種是不能捉住題意，以致情思放誕太過，而漸趨散漫，正好無覊之馬，奔放而不可收斂，如　之繅絲，千頭萬緖，無從歸納；一種是思路不能暢達，往往一題到手，便會失之呆滯，　管苦索，不知從何說起，即使勉强促成，亦是囫圇說過，拘泥不知所云的。推其原因，固然是由於文學要秪的淺薄，還夠不上寫作的水準，由於書本閱讀得太少，應用的資料不豐富。總之不善發揮，實爲主要成因。</p>
<p>（三）作文須尋求眞理揭發底蘊。專請詞藻與虛飾的繁文縟言。是不足稍文章的優美。反轉來說，一篇設　恬淡，而每一句每一字，都有其至理存在的，那末雖然是極其平實的文章，亦是値得推重的；　其次是創作者對於敘述某一件事，要有獨到的見解，和超人的批判，譬如研究哲學，能闌演它的玄理奧旨，研究經學的，能揭發它的微言大義，洞察其竅要，發前人所未發。</p>
<p>（四）文學的創作又要能感化人，大抵一篇有功世敎的文字，一定有一種潛力，有一種至情，流露在字裏行間，而會使人讀之生感。曾記得迭更司著孝女耐兒傳一書，描寫耐兒的事略。曾轟動一時，後來當他寫「纑編」稿子的時候，一連有幾百多個讀者。深恐耐兒的結果必致於死，都紛紛投書給迭更司請求他勿使耐兒得死的結果。從這一點，便可見迭氏寫作的動人，和感人的深刻。</p>
<p>此外又如我國孔雀東南飛一詩，其中描寫仲卿心神的恍惚，蘭芝情意的纏綿，姑的虐待媳婦，慈母的愛護兒女，以及胞兄的暴斂，媒者的巧言。莫不一一峯露，躍躍紙上。</p>
<p>（五）綜上所述外，文章尤須注重內美外美，所謂「內美」和「外美」，亦就是「文質」和「文量」的兼備，換句話說：「單有思想情感，單就練字鑄句，是不夠稱文的，必須要內外同符，表裏相發，才可成文」。</p>
<p>劉彥和文心雕龍情採篇有云：「夫鉛黛所以飾容，而盼倩生於淑姿，文采所以飾言，而辯麗本於情性，故情者文之經，辭者理之緯，經正而後緯成，理定而後辭暢，此立文之本源也」。透澈詳盡，可作我們的取鏡。</p>
<p>結論——人類由草味未開化時代，一直進展到科學昌明的今日，中間自然的變遷，人事的沿革，是無時無刻不在改進的，人類文化的發展，無疑的亦在同樣的進程中，所以二十世紀今日的文學，已可說是由簡略而漸趨詳明，由武斷而漸趨精確，雖然現世的文學界，已如晨曦　明，曙光將見，但是我們依舊是不能滿足的，我們需要精進，我們需要更多的努力，來完成那艱鉅的復興工作，來達到「眞，善，美」圓滿的境地。（却酬）</p>

<p>我愛太陽，我愛光明，當太陽西落的時候，恐怕，怕光明的消失，我愛，愛太陽西落時的紅霞，她盡力地，努力地，發出最後的，未死的光芒，好像在說：「光明不會滅亡的！」黑暗漸漸底降臨，惡魔將呑沒了大地！我愛，愛太陽西落的一剎那，光明跟黑暗間，有力底　鬥！黑暗竟勝利了！我流着淚，呆看太陽的沒落！黑暗中，我更愛，愛那已死去的太陽，我失望了，我憂　了，一會我又被新生之歌所振作！這是當太陽西落時吿訴我的，「我是決不會死的！」明天，明天我將重來！重來溫暖大地山河！你們等待着！好好地努力着！我又微笑了！當太陽西落的進修。</p>

<p>國語課。敎室里靜靜地，幾十隻小眼睛盯住黑板上。</p>
<p>突然，有誰大聲嚷起來：</p>
<p>「唐…唐…唐先生：王…王…王善庭……偷……偷…偷東西」！</p>
<p>大家都聽得出那是莫得財急急巴巴的聲音。</p>
<p>做先生的馬上從黑板上轉過身來，輕輕地將長頭髮掠到後面去：「誰？」</p>
<p>「王善庭」！兩三個人的聲音。</p>
<p>「偷什麽」：唐先生放下書。</p>
<p>「大…大…大餅」，莫得財大聲地。</p>
<p>於是大家都笑起來，大家都抬起頭囘轉頭看看坐在莫得財旁邊的王善庭。………</p>
<p>「唐先生」：王善庭矮小的個子站起來，「我沒偷！…是莫得財自己偷我的…大餅」！</p>
<p>「下課再講」：做先生的又翻開書。</p>
<p>「到底是那能一囘事」？下課，先生帶着兩個人走進和敎室連在一起的辦公室，後面跟着一大帬旁聽着。</p>
<p>「我…娘…娘…娘舅…今…今…給我…兩……兩…兩隻大…大餅，我…我…我才吃…吃了一隻……剛剛摸…摸袋袋……沒…有有了……」莫得財吃力地擺動着頭。</p>
<p>「你怎麽曉得是王善庭拿的呢」？</p>
<p>「我在他…他…床　板里…尋…尋…着半塊…，他…他…已經吃…吃…過了……你看…他…他嘴巴里邊有芝…芝蔴呢！」</p>
<p>「你怎麽說」？</p>
<p>「我今天中飯沒吃，姆媽給我一塊錢買……」</p>
<p>「爲什麽不吃中飯」：先生有點不相信。</p>
<p>「姆媽說米沒有了，要去借……」</p>
<p>忽然，有人叫起來：「唐先生：一定是王善庭偷的！他常常偷東西的」！</p>
<p>王善庭可老是一聲不響地站在寫字檯面前，身上，老是那件肥大的藍布的　工人衣，袖口捲起了四五道，露出兩隻灰黑的小手。</p>
<p>着頭望着別人，鼓起了嘴。</p>
<p>案情很明白：用不着再　下去，甚至「酷刑逼供，」先生商量了老半天，決定停學一星期，一面寫信通知該生家長來回管束……</p>
<p>於是，一封信寫了出去：</p>
<p>「大西路永源浜　　號……王吳氏……」</p>
<p>「先生！這兒是…是…讀夜　學堂麽？…是…」一個中年的婦人畏縮地站在辦公室門口。</p>
<p>「是的！」一位先生忍住笑走到門口：「什麽事？」</p>
<p>「我…我…我是阿四的娘…他…在學堂里……，這封信……。從最裏面一層的衣袋里摸出了折得很整齊的信封。</p>
<p>那位先生於是抹了抹頭髮，詳詳細細地吿訴這位家長：王善庭在學校里偷了人家的東西，而且，據同學說，他偷東西已經不止一次，偷人家的鉛筆，橡皮，拍紙薄，刀片，……甚至於：——</p>
<p>「甚至於連字紙簿里的字紙也要偷！」</p>
<p>「偷東西？……」那位家長似乎有點不相信：「…阿四不會偷東西的！我們阿四……」</p>
<p>「你別吵！有事實證明……現在學校里罰他停學一星期……」</p>
<p>「不要　？」那位家長大吃一驚：「先生！…那不能！…你們先生做做好事！…讓…　阿四讀下去吧！…叫他下囘不要再偷東西了！…我等會敲死這小鬼……」</p>
<p>走到馬路上，她心裏忽然難過起來。</p>
<p>那是一個多月以前，孩子在預備寫描紅簿的時候，從書包裹掏出許多字紙。</p>
<p>「不要瞎摜！」姆媽罵起來：「生風爐也是好的，柴爿這麽貴，……你們學堂裏有字紙　麽？……」</p>
<p>「有！每天總要堆得滿滿的！」</p>
<p>「你每天替我帶點囘來！」姆媽正經地說：柴爿好省省！……</p>
<p>從此，每天放夜學囘來，孩子總是從書包裹先倒出一堆字紙來。……</p>
<p>想呀想的，她恨不得囘到學堂裏去抱着兒子大哭一塲，——哭她們娘兒倆的運氣不好，到處受人欺侮！孩子還要一個禮拜不准唸書！</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Completion of Japan's Domestic Restructuring and the Current Situation in China <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The international situation has already moved toward the stage of a decisive battle. The German-Soviet battlefield, the Italian-British-American battlefield in the Mediterranean, and the British-American-Japanese battlefield in the Southwest Pacific are advancing daily toward the stage of coordinated operations. In order to accelerate the collapse of the old world order and the establishment of a new world order, not only are Germany and Italy in the West carrying out political and social reform movements outside of the war, thereby gathering the spiritual and material strength of the people of various European countries to strike and eliminate any activities of the enemy. In the East, the countries in the Pacific need to organize all their strength through political and social activities to meet the needs of the decisive battle stage, to strike and eliminate the activities of enemies in any area, and to establish a great East Asian cause that must be victorious. Moreover, it must be taken into account that the times are progressing. While this effort of the East Asian countries is progressing, the enemy is also desperately advancing its various activities. Therefore, today's political activities are showing a competitive attitude. Whoever can adapt to the new situation and implement new countermeasures, and who does not hesitate or procrastinate, can stand on the superior side in the decisive battle and seize the trophy of victory.</p>
<p>Under this new situation and new demands, Japan has already begun domestic restructuring, engaging in the reorganization and adaptation of various domestic systems. For the need of new situations, new organizations and facilities are required. The Japanese authorities have begun the rectification of domestic institutions with great courage. The first is the reform of local administrative institutions. Not long ago, the appointment of council chairmen in various regions was made, strengthening the organization of local public opinion so that it can promote the effectiveness of the people assisting the government. Now, it is further striving to refresh local administrative institutions as a foundation for the reorganization of central political institutions, dividing the country into nine regions and appointing wise and experienced local officials to comprehensively adjust the administration of prefectures and counties in the region. From the perspective of civil facilities, regarding the already established Agricultural Association Law in the agricultural sector, the enforcement decree has been scheduled to be promulgated in late this month, so that the newly formed agricultural associations can solve the long-standing issues in Japan's agricultural policy. In the industrial and commercial sectors, the "Chamber of Commerce and Industry Economic Association Law" was promulgated on the first day of last month, and orders were issued to establish "Chambers of Commerce and Industry Economic Associations" in seven prefectures outside Hokkaido and to appoint members. Other prefectures will also be established in sequence, with the goal of completing the establishment in all prefectures by mid-September. From October 1st, this new organization will be able to start working to promote the new policy of cooperation between the government and the people. In addition, in terms of official systems and personnel selection, from the local to the central government, thorough improvements have been or are being prepared for implementation, striving to adapt to the new situation and generate new efficiency. In Chinese terms, it is to use new people and implement new policies, so that they can always stand in a superior position under the new circumstances and strive for victory in the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>The restructuring of Japan's domestic administration, as seen from this Central Cooperation Council, has indeed reached the point of completion. From the restructuring of Japan's central and local administration, one cannot help but think of the current situation in China. Frankly speaking, in the eyes of our Chinese politicians, Japan's national organization has long reached the ideal level of soundness, Japan's administrative institutions at all levels and personnel selection have long adapted to the war situation and reached the ideal level, and the harmonious relationship between the Japanese government and the people, and the coordination of various sectors of agriculture, industry, and commerce with wartime economic policies, have long been regarded by us as models. However, with the evolution of the world war situation and the international situation, in order to always stand in an invincible position, the Japanese government has never been satisfied with its existing institutions and original personnel, and often makes necessary reforms and rectifications. The reason why a country is strong and a government is supported by the people can be found here. Do all these facts not deserve reflection and vigilance from our country's politicians?</p>
<p>From the current general trend in China, due to the victory achieved by Japan's sacrifices and struggles in the Greater East Asia War, and due to the implementation of Japan's new policy towards China, generally speaking, it is indeed optimistic. However, trying to speak from the stage of the world's decisive battle, the mission that our country should bear, and from our domestic situation and our own strength, we should not only feel ashamed, but also be terrified! In the Greater East Asia War, in what areas have we exerted what strength? This question may be a bit difficult to answer, right? Of course, our government and people, in recent years, under the principle of sharing joys and sorrows, have indeed wanted to cooperate with friendly countries, but speaking from China's construction and the task of the Greater East Asia War, it seems that no one can be without a sense of "heavy responsibility and a long road"? In the political aspect, from the central to the local level, from the institutions to the personnel selection, although the authorities have exhausted their efforts, it seems that there are still many that cannot adapt to the needs of the new situation or cannot truly accomplish their mission. The adjustment of our country's central to local administration, especially the improvement and enhancement of the relationship between the government and the people, seems to be even more often modeled on the success of this domestic restructuring in Japan, and requires careful research and sincere effort.</p>
<p>The importance of our country's position in the current world decisive battle, especially in the Greater East Asia War, goes without saying, and everyone understands that our current tasks towards friendly countries and East Asia are not only to concentrate our national strength to cooperate in the war, but also to stabilize the order in the rear of the Greater East Asia War, and to launch a production and construction movement to promote the East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere. The realization and completion of this responsibility, on the one hand, depends on the realization of comprehensive peace, so that the whole country can devote its heart and soul to it, and on the other hand, it depends even more on the consolidation, soundness, and flexible application of the National Government and the local political institutions under its jurisdiction, while at the same time focusing on grasping the people's psychology, so as to thoroughly improve the relationship between the government and the people, and create a cohesive political situation, with 400 million people of one heart, shouldering the mission of war and construction. Now, the rumors of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party re-enacting the civil war are very prevalent. While the truth is not yet clear, we cannot rush to a conclusion, but the exposure of the weaknesses within the anti-Japanese war camp, and the people's demand for fairness and peace must be more urgent, which may not be a new opportunity for the country and the nation. If the National Government and all the people can take this opportunity to revitalize and rise up, improve politics, and safeguard the people's livelihood, then the psychology of the people under the rule of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party will change accordingly, and the cohesive political situation will be realized, and it will not be difficult to quickly complete the comprehensive peace in the country.</p>
<p>The evolution of the world situation and the East Asia War, the completion of the political restructuring of friendly countries, and the development of our internal situation all require a thorough political reform. Time waits for no one. I hope that the people of the country will encourage each other.</p>

<h3 id="e2">### After the Ancient City of Rome Was Bombed, the Pope Lodged a Serious Protest, Delivered in Writing to Roosevelt and Churchill, Catholics Were Unanimously Indignant <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Rome, 20th (Central News Agency) After the anti-Axis bombing of Rome, Pope Pius XII has lodged a serious protest in writing to Roosevelt and Churchill.</p>
<p>Rome, 20th (Central News Agency) A special correspondent of the Agence Telegraphique Suisse last night quoted well-informed Vatican sources as saying that after the anti-Axis air raid on Rome yesterday morning, the Deputy Secretary of State of the Vatican, Msgr. Montini, met with the American Chargé d'Affaires Tittmann a few hours later, expressing the Vatican's indignation at the matter. It is said that well-informed sources have said that Tittmann himself could not hide his trepidation about the air raid on Rome. Tittmann believed that President Roosevelt had promised the Pope that the anti-Axis powers would not take such action. It is not yet known what action the Vatican is preparing to take in response to the anti-Axis air raid on Rome, but it is believed that the Vatican will soon have to clarify its attitude.</p>
<p>Vatican City, 20th (Central News Agency) Havas News Agency reports that although the air raid on Rome on Monday morning lasted for three hours, the Pope still received guests as usual. Those received included Cardinal Granito Pignatelli di Belmonte, secretary, ambassadors, and other personnel.</p>
<p>Madrid, 20th (Central News Agency) Havas News Agency reports that after the news of the anti-Axis air raid on Rome reached here, Catholics gathered in various churches to pray for the holy city and the Pope. Responsible figures here said that this air raid seems likely to ignite the public anger of Catholics around the world against the anti-Axis powers.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 20th (Central News Agency) A Reuters correspondent at General Eisenhower's headquarters in North Africa reported last night that the first anti-Axis air raid on Rome was carried out entirely by American Air Force Flying Fortresses, Mitchell bombers, and Marauder bombers. The Flying Fortresses were not escorted by other aircraft, while the Mitchell and Marauder bombers were escorted by Lightning fighters, all belonging to the American Air Force in Northwest Africa. The Liberator bombers were also not escorted and belonged to the American Air Force's Ninth Air Force stationed in the Middle East, commanded by Major General Brereton. The first bomb fell at 11:13 a.m. yesterday.</p>
<p>Manila, 20th (Central News Agency) The three million Catholics in the Philippines were extremely shocked to learn that American aircraft had bombed the holy city of Rome. They all believed that this despicable act by the American military was outrageous to both God and man. According to the papal nuncio Piani, this fact has greatly dissatisfied not only the Catholics in the Philippines, but also Catholics all over the world. Although Rome may be destroyed, the culture of Christianity will never be destroyed. The bombing of Rome by American aircraft has revealed the barbarous actions of the United States, which touts humanitarianism but resorts to any means to achieve its goals. We must resolutely condemn it with justice.</p>
<h3 id="e3">### The King of Italy and the Pope Inspect the Disaster Area <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Rome, 20th (Central News Agency) Stefani News Agency reports that King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy, accompanied by the Queen, inspected the disaster areas in Rome that were hit by the anti-Axis air raid yesterday morning. The Queen also went to various hospitals to comfort the injured. The Pope, without notifying anyone, left the Vatican at 6 p.m. accompanied by the Deputy Secretary of State of the Vatican, Msgr. Montini, to inspect the bombed Basilica of Saint Lawrence outside the Walls and the damaged Verano Cemetery.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Churches and Cemeteries Become Rubble Fields <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>As soon as the Pope arrived near the cemetery, he could see the effects of the bombing. Several roads had become rubble, and several buildings in the University City had also been damaged. A crowd gathered in the square outside the cemetery, immediately recognizing the Pope and showing their respect. The Pope got out of the car in front of the ruins of the church and lingered for a moment, seemingly saddened. This one of the most beautiful churches in Rome no longer existed. The entrance had been destroyed, all the columns had collapsed, and only two remained, one of which was also leaning. The frescoes of Saint Stephen and Saint Lawrence by Francesco Cozza had been damaged. The altar built in 1148 and the marble shrine had been destroyed. The organ had also been destroyed. The triumphal arch still stood, but it had been heavily damaged. All three chapels of the nave were gone. The altar of the twelfth century was also destroyed. However, the tomb of Pope Pius IX was not damaged, but the Sancta Sanctorum was damaged. After the Pope got into the car, he blessed the crowd kneeling in the square.</p>
<p>Rome, 20th (Central News Agency) Havas News Agency reports that the Basilica of Saint Lawrence outside the Walls is the oldest church in Rome, built in 330 AD, when Emperor Constantine laid the foundation stone. It has been more than 1,600 years since then. Therefore, the Roman Catholic Church insisted in 1929 that the church should be classified as extraterritorial property of the Vatican.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Military Police Engage in Relief Work <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Rome, 20th (Central News Agency) Officials announced last night that the main targets of the anti-Axis air raid were the Maggiola and Tiburtina residential areas, where houses were adjacent to each other and countless workers lived. It is said that the damage in the Tiburtina area was extremely serious. The Basilica of Saint Lawrence outside the Walls, one of the churches established by Constantine in Rome, has also been destroyed. The church contains the tombs of many deceased popes. The Catholic cemetery of Verano and its church were also hit by many bombs. Part of the hospital was also severely damaged. Yesterday's attack took place shortly before noon. The alarm was issued at 11:00 a.m., and shortly thereafter, the first batch of anti-Axis bomber squadrons appeared in the skies over Rome, flying at an altitude of 6,000 meters. The enemy planes came in several waves, lasting for about two and a half hours. A bomb landed only 300 meters from the Lateran Basilica, which belongs to the Vatican and is therefore extraterritorial. After the bomb exploded, houses 400 to 500 meters away were also shaken. If the anti-Axis powers attack Rome again, the buildings belonging to the Vatican and enjoying extraterritorial rights, such as the Lateran Basilica and the Basilica of Saint Mary Major, may also suffer damage. The scene of the affected parts of Rome was bleak. The roads were cratered, the houses were destroyed and still burning, and the dead and wounded lay scattered on the roads. Homeless elderly people wandered on the sides of the roads. A large number of military police were maintaining order and organizing relief and construction work.</p>

<p>Geneva, 20th (Central News Agency) German News Agency quoted Moscow sources as saying that the Soviet military does not recognize the anti-Axis offensive in Sicily as the opening of a second front. The semi-official newspaper "Moscow News," published in English in Moscow, stated that declaring the offensive in Sicily as the realization of the second front in Europe does not correspond to the facts. If a real second front in Europe has not been established, the German command will still focus on the Eastern Front, and the Soviet military does not feel that the Eastern Front has been relaxed in the slightest.</p>

Therefore, the steps to restore Soviet-Polish relations should be taken first by the Soviet Union. If measures to promote the reconciliation of the two countries can be successful, then I will not make things difficult until the very end. However, what Poland is most concerned about is maintaining the sovereignty and integrity of the Polish Republic.</p>

<p>Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) According to information received here last night, the current center of combat in Sicily is the Catania area. At the same time, the British and American forces in southern Sicily continue to press toward the Axis positions. On Saturday, the British Eighth Army attacked along the coastal area south of Catania and launched a large-scale attack from the western edge of Catania. Havas News Agency revealed last night that the British army suffered heavy losses in this encirclement attack but was eventually forced to approach. On the highway from Syracuse to Catania, the British army used thirty tanks to assist in establishing a bridgehead but was forced to retreat after being hit by the Axis main battle line's artillery fire. The British tanks and infantry attacked again, but were unsuccessful. At the same time, the Axis combat units in the mountains west of the Catania Plain are putting up extremely fierce resistance against the invading enemy forces. On Sunday, the anti-Axis powers continued to array their forces, with the clear intention of launching a decisive attack. In the early morning, they launched an attack on the German positions with powerful tanks and infantry units. The anti-Axis forces suffered heavy losses in this attack and were forced to call in reinforcements, but fortunately, the German army fought bravely and the enemy forces failed to approach the Axis main battle line.</p>

<p>Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) The German military authorities announced on the 20th that from July 5th to 19th, the German army captured 45,000 Soviet troops, seized 4,800 tanks, 2,201 artillery pieces, 1,080 mortars, and 12,766 machine guns, and other weapons and military supplies in the central and southern sectors of the Eastern Front.</p>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) Havas News Agency reports that Berlin has recently been using the term "blood mill" to describe the war on the Eastern Front and the heavy losses of the Soviet army. On a three-kilometer front north of Orel, the Soviet army used six infantry divisions and multiple tank units to attack the German positions. In other words, there was a regiment of infantry for every 100 meters of the front. As a result, all the attacks were repelled, and each Soviet regiment was left with only 35 to 50 men. In the fierce battle of Miovsk, the Soviet army attempted to break through the German defense line and also suffered heavy losses. One hundred Soviet tanks attacked a German division, resulting in the loss of 39 tanks. In another sector, 43 tanks were lost. The German positions were breached in several places, but after a counterattack, the German army immediately recovered the positions. The Soviet offensive southeast of Orel was weaker, so the German transportation lines were reorganized and a surrounded German battalion was relieved. North of Orel, several brigades of Soviet tanks attacked, and after a counterattack, the German army destroyed 44 of their vehicles. The local attacks by enemy forces in other areas were also ineffective. The German air force's activities continued to inflict heavy losses on the Soviet army.</p>

Even in disease prevention work, there have been extraordinary achievements. Therefore, the place where epidemics used to be rampant has now become a healthy and vibrant city. In the past, various infectious diseases such as malaria, dengue fever, cholera, dysentery, and typhoid fever were widespread in Singapore City, which was nothing less than a den of disease demons. Since the Japanese occupation, although it has only been a little over a year, through continuous efforts in disease prevention and treatment, infectious diseases are now almost completely eradicated.

<h3 id="e17">A Talk by the Japanese Economic Mission: Setting a Limit on Savings Certificate Issuance, Strengthening Financial Institutions to Recover Idle Funds, and Mobilizing Local Capital in the Textile Industry <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese Economic Mission, led by Mr. Masatsune Shokoshi, has been in Shanghai since the 7th of this month, holding talks with Chinese and Japanese figures from various sectors in Shanghai, and exchanging opinions frankly. This lasted for six days. In particular, interacting with Chinese non-governmental economic figures was one of the mission's important goals, and it achieved considerable results in consolidating the connection between Chinese and Japanese economic figures. The mission traveled to Nanjing by train at 9:00 AM on the 12th to exchange views with key figures of the National Government on important issues such as prices, currency, and trade. On the train, reporters learned about the results of the mission's talks with key figures from both China and Japan during their stay in Shanghai. The observations of Messrs. Ogura, Akashi, Nango, and Kotera are summarized below:</p>
<p>Masaru Ogura</p>
<p>Since arriving in Shanghai, the most important issue in China now is the price issue. We have listened to the opinions of key figures from both China and Japan on this issue and it seems efforts are being made to study and address countermeasures.</p>
<p>Secondly, the most important opinion among Chinese financial figures is their hope to set a maximum issuance limit for savings certificates. If this can be achieved, Chinese financial figures can devote all their efforts to building China's financial and economic system. The required funds can also be raised.</p>
<p>As for the operation of China's economy, it still seems necessary to guide it with Chinese thinking. Japan must study China's national character and utilize the unique characteristics of the Chinese people from an economic perspective.</p>
<p>Teruo Akashi</p>
<p>The impressions after this cordial discussion with key figures in Shanghai's economic circles are exactly the same as when I accompanied Viscount Shibusawa to China in the third year of the Taisho era (1914). At that time, when I met Mr. Xu Shichang of the Yuan Shikai government, I said that although Japan had learned how to concentrate national capital, it could not achieve effective funding. This situation remains the same today because in China, funds and production are still separated and not combined. Therefore, neither can production enterprises be revitalized, nor can the recovery of funds be achieved. Therefore, what China most hopes for now is to cultivate and strengthen the financial institutions that are gradually getting on track, make full use of them, and seek to recover dispersed funds.</p>
<p>Saburo Nango</p>
<p>When observing the current situation of China's economic circles from the perspective of goods and materials, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the shortage of materials caused by the cessation of trade with Britain and the United States must be supplemented to stabilize the economy.</p>
<p>During the war, it is difficult to supplement materials in this vast territory, but if the exchange of materials throughout Greater East Asia can be realized, it seems possible. Japan is already studying and drafting a plan for this overall. Investigations into the quantity and price of various materials throughout the Greater East Asia region have been completed. If these are used to promote the current exchange of materials, maintaining the circulation of currency will not be difficult. China's currency issue is currently being reviewed from this perspective. The Trade Corporation has been active since July 1st, but it will not actually start operating until after October. If the China Joint Operations Association can be realized, Sino-Japanese trade will be conducted in coordination with the association.</p>
<p>Gengo Kotera</p>
<p>China's textile industry has already reached the world's standards. Therefore, Japan should entrust the textile industry to China, while Japan engages in advanced precision industries. Therefore, Japan's textile industry should move to the mainland. To encourage the investment of Chinese national capital in the textile industry, the ratio of Chinese and Japanese shareholders should be determined to be more favorable to the Chinese side.</p>
<p>Using cotton produced in Central China and spinning it in Shanghai seems necessary from the perspective of the entire Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Regarding methods to encourage cotton cultivation, instead of using subsidy policies, it is better to adopt the method of raising purchase prices and including it in the cost of the textile industry. In short, those belonging to the light industry sector, not only the textile industry, must be entrusted to the Chinese to show them a grand goal and give them hope. (Sho: Translated from the Tokyo "Yomiuri Hochi Shimbun" of July 14th)</p>
<h3 id="e18">Speech by Chairman Wang at the Soviet People's Congress (Continued) <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>There is another excuse from Chongqing: Even if Britain and the United States are unreliable, will China be liberated by participating in the Greater East Asia War? We have already answered this excuse in theory, and now we will answer it with facts. Since January 9th of this year, our friendly neighbor Japan has signed an agreement with us to implement the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights, which we have sought for a century. This was originally stipulated in Article 7 of the Basic Treaty on Sino-Japanese Relations, but now it has been implemented ahead of schedule. First, the exclusive concessions in Beijing, Tianjin, Hankou, Guangzhou, Hangzhou, Suzhou, and Xiamen were returned. Yesterday, Ambassador Tani and Foreign Minister Chu signed an agreement to return the Shanghai International Settlement. This is the most practical proof of friendly Japan's assistance to China in fulfilling its long-cherished wish for independence and autonomy. I think Jiangsu compatriots should especially remember how the Shanghai International Settlement was established. Because the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom occupied Nanjing and Suzhou, the former Qing Dynasty knew that it could not defeat them, so it sought help from Britain. Gordon's foreign gun team helped them defeat the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, and Shanghai's concession was used as a reward. Since then, the Shanghai International Settlement has become a major gap in the southeastern provinces and even the whole country, and Chinese blood has flowed torrentially from this gap into Britain, leading to a quasi-colonial phenomenon. I know that all of you compatriots are excited to hear the news of the return of the Shanghai International Settlement, so the excuses spread by Chongqing are not worth refuting. I would also like to explain to all of you compatriots why our friendly neighbor Japan is doing this, because the Co-Prosperity in East Asia is the highest ideal, and recently, because China is cooperating in the Greater East Asia War, the realization of this ideal has been accelerated. China's independence and autonomy, from China's point of view, is a requirement for China to become a powerful country in the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. From Japan's point of view, China's request is exactly what Japan hopes for, because Japan would rather have a strong partner than a weak one in the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Therefore, Japan not only sympathizes with China's independence and autonomy, but also cares about it, and treats it as its own business. That is why there are these measures, which are certainly not superficial, and especially not a trick of power. This is true not only in politics, but also in economics. Today's Greater East Asia War is a matter of life and death for all of East Asia. All East Asian nations have only one way out: to share hardship and seek common prosperity, to share death and seek common life. Understanding this point, Chongqing's false excuses will naturally be blocked by the facts. I not only hope that they will be blocked, but especially that they will be enlightened, because the facts rooted in theory are the most likely to enlighten them.</p>
<p>I have explained the justice of the Greater East Asia War above. I would also like to say a few words about the situation.</p>
<p>Do you compatriots still have doubts about the prospects for victory in the Greater East Asia War? I think there is no need to doubt. The Greater East Asia War will surely win and not fail, without any doubt, because the Greater East Asia War, as the name suggests, is a war for East Asian nations to defend East Asia. We never thought of crossing the borders of Greater East Asia to invade Britain in Europe or the United States in America. It was Britain and the United States who wanted to make East Asia their permanent semi-colony that crossed the borders of Europe and America to grab it and not let go. So this war, in terms of justice, is a punitive expedition against rebellion, and in terms of situation, we are waiting for the tired enemy with ease. Since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, our friendly neighbor Japan has driven out the forces of Britain and the United States in the South Seas and the Eastern Pacific, and has occupied all bases. From now on, as long as the East Asian nations are united, Britain and the United States will never have the power to recover. Britain has been disintegrating since the war, and even India is in danger. It is well known that it cannot extend to East Asia. It is also impossible for the United States to transport three or four million troops from San Francisco across the five thousand nautical miles of ocean to fight a decisive battle. At most, it will harass with planes and submarines, or occupy one or two insignificant islands with a small number of troops. This has no decisive impact on the overall situation. Understanding the situation mentioned above, we can know that the Greater East Asia War is only the Greater East Asia War. As long as all East Asian nations are united, it will surely win and not fail without any doubt.</p>
<p>Compatriots, today, on the occasion of the second anniversary of the Anti-Communist Rural Pacification Movement, I will explain the relationship between the Anti-Communist Rural Pacification Movement and the Greater East Asia War. Compatriots, working hard on the Anti-Communist Rural Pacification Movement is an important task in the Greater East Asia War. Ensuring public security to stabilize the rear of the Greater East Asia War, increasing production to cultivate the resources of the Greater East Asia War, and undertaking everything with a spirit of hard work, endurance, courage, and progress. During the war, suffering is inevitable, not only for the defeated countries, but also for the victorious countries. Even neutral countries are like this. It can be said that in today's world, no one can avoid suffering. It depends on how to endure and overcome it. Since we have made up our minds to share hardship and seek common prosperity, to share death and seek common life, then light is right in front of us.</p>
<p>Now I will summarize in one sentence. I came today to commemorate the second anniversary of the Anti-Communist Rural Pacification Movement. First of all, I thank the friendly troops for their strong assistance. At the same time, I thank Governor Li and all comrades from all walks of life in the Anti-Communist Rural Pacification Movement for their solidarity. I sincerely pray for the health and success of all the soldiers and comrades. I enthusiastically shout, "Long live the Republic of China! Long live the completion of the Greater East Asia War! Long live the liberation of the East Asian nations!"</p>
<h3 id="e19">A Discussion by a Senior Japanese Navy Official: The Essence of Navy Day and the Hope That the People of Our Country Will Also Understand the Ocean <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency): Yesterday (20th) was Japan's Third Navy Day. To understand the meaning of this anniversary, the reporter specifically visited a senior Japanese Navy official, who said that between the years of Meiji 9 (1876), Emperor Meiji of Japan once boarded the Meiji Maru and inspected the conditions of the sea in the northeastern region, to express his concern for the importance of the ocean. Recently, the Japanese authorities' Maritime Affairs Bureau has emphasized that the sea is even more important to the modern era. Therefore, in order to give the people a deep understanding of the sea and to respect the hard work and great achievements of sailors, and to promote the development of the navy, the day when Emperor Meiji routinely inspected the ocean was designated as Navy Day, starting in Showa 16 (1941), which was the 30th year of the Republic of China. 1941 was the first anniversary, 1942 was the second anniversary, and this year is the third anniversary. Every year on this day, Japan invariably holds grand celebrations. Although we live on land and are far from the navy, we must not ignore the ocean as insignificant. Therefore, the strength of a modern country requires not only a strong army, but also a strong navy and air force. Furthermore, modern warring nations all consider possessing control of the sea and air as important conditions for victory in war. Therefore, modern countries attach great importance to the navy and actively strive for development in the ocean to create a strong and massive navy. Today, Japan has acquired the foundation for certain victory in the Greater East Asia War because it holds control of the sea and controls the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Because of the strength of the Japanese Navy, there will certainly be a day of victory in the Greater East Asia War. Today, on the Third Navy Day, I feel infinitely happy. However, I still have one thought, which is that the Chinese people's understanding of the ocean seems to be insufficient, perhaps because they have less contact with the ocean. Therefore, I finally hope that the Chinese people will start paying attention to and understanding the ocean from today onwards, so that they can contribute to the common effort and complete the goal of East Asian coexistence and co-prosperity.</p>

<p>Suzhou, 20th (Central News Agency): The area along the coast of Yu County is located on the Yangtze River. Since the Anti-Communist Rural Pacification Movement, it has been an important transportation route between the north and south, and commerce has prospered. However, it was suddenly attacked by strong winds on the evening of the 17th, and the river tide rose sharply. The old and new sea dikes along the river all collapsed, and the area became a vast ocean, turning into a swamp. The disaster-stricken area stretches from Wenxing Township in the north of the county to the Xichang Fushan area in the south of Yu County, with more than 20 dikes. Fields and houses were all flooded, and the losses were very heavy, which is rare in history. After the county government learned of the situation on the 19th, it is sending personnel to investigate and devise relief measures.</p>

<p>Since all the investigators of the Materials Investigation Committee went out last Tuesday to investigate the hoarding of materials in warehouses and godowns in the city, the preliminary investigation of cotton yarn and cloth has come to an end. The materials obtained from the investigation are now being reviewed. According to the quantity declared to the Economic Bureau and the Public Works Department by the company, if the material exceeds the registered quantity, it will be treated as domestic product and punished according to the law. It is understood that in order to make the investigation of materials more effective, the association has drafted a measure to reward those who report hoarders of materials, which will be discussed and decided at the second committee meeting to be held on the 22nd of this month. At the same time, the scope of other investigated materials and the assignment of investigators will be discussed in order to make the investigation work more thorough and complete.</p>

<p>The return of the International Settlement and the French Concession in the city is imminent. From now on, national land sovereignty can be complete, and unequal treaties such as extraterritoriality will be completely abolished, eliminating the basis for Anglo-American aggression and expansion for a century. The public security of Greater Shanghai will naturally become clearer. In order to unify and complete the administrative structure of the city, the Shanghai Special Municipal Government recognizes that Nanshi has always been a prosperous commercial area in southern Shanghai with simple customs and a dense population. The post-war recovery of various industries in the area has indeed made leaping progress, but the measures of local administration since the district office was dissolved. Progress has been slow. Therefore, it is deemed necessary to restore it. It has been decided to establish the Seventh District Government in order to match the wartime structure and strengthen local administration. However, the position of director of the district office is a heavy responsibility and cannot be undertaken by officials who do not have the support of the people. After careful consideration by the city government, it was decided to appoint Lu Ying, Director of the Municipal Inspection Bureau, concurrently, and he is responsible for the establishment. The official order was issued yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e29">Compulsory Labor Insurance in the City <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>The city will start handling compulsory labor insurance for factories in the city starting tomorrow. All factory owners or employers engaged in hazardous or unsanitary work must insure their employees in this insurance and apply to the bureau for insurance before August 4. The provisional outline is as follows:</p>
<p>Provisional Outline</p>
<p>(A) General Provisions (1) Social insurance and simplified insurance are necessary measures for implementing social policies and should be state-run enterprises. Other private insurance operators may not operate. (2) The Social Simplified Insurance Bureau is the insurer for social insurance and simplified insurance and is responsible for all insurance payments. (B) Social Insurance (3) Social insurance is divided into compulsory labor insurance and general occupation insurance. (4) Compulsory labor insurance and general occupation insurance are both aimed at reducing and exempting laborers or general occupations from economic losses caused by death, injury, disease, or childbirth due to work performance. (C) Compulsory Labor Insurance (5) All employees of factories subject to the Factory Law, mines subject to the Mining Law, or those engaged in hazardous or unsanitary work are insured by compulsory labor insurance, but temporary workers who have worked for less than one month are not included. (6) The insured acquires the qualification of being insured from the date of employment and loses the qualification upon death, dismissal, or resignation. (7) The insurer may collect insurance premiums from the insured and the employer who employs the insured in accordance with the following provisions. The insurance premium is fifty thousandths of the insured's monthly income, such as (1) the insured pays fifteen thousandths per month, (2) the employer bears thirty-five thousandths per month. (8) The insurance premium shall be paid to the Social Simplified Insurance Bureau by the employer every month. The employer may deduct the amount payable by the insured from the insured's wages. (9) When the insured dies, is injured, becomes ill, or gives birth due to work performance, he/she shall receive insurance benefits from the insurer. The method will be determined separately. (10) If the employer refuses to insure his employees in compulsory labor insurance without a legitimate reason, he shall be fined up to 5,000 yuan. (D) General Occupation Insurance (11) All employees who are engaged in the same business or the same business, or who are employees of the same institution, may be insured by general occupation insurance. (12) General occupation insurance is voluntary insurance, but when the Social Simplified Insurance Bureau deems it necessary for the spirit of mutual aid and assistance, it may force it to participate. (13) The insurance premium for general occupation insurance shall be paid by the insured at the time of the establishment of the contract in accordance with his/her monthly income of twenty thousandths. (14) If the insured dies, is injured, becomes ill, or gives birth, he/she shall receive insurance benefits from the insurer. The method of payment shall be the same as the method of payment for compulsory labor insurance benefits.</p>
<h3 id="e30">Local Public Opinion Organs: Establishment Still Pending; Rumors of Personnel Preparations Unconfirmed <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Recent rumors in the city suggest the imminent establishment of a Provisional Municipal Political Council. However, according to inquiries made by a Central News Agency reporter with relevant parties, there is currently no such plan. The takeover of the concessions is proving extremely busy, with matters of organization, personnel, documents, funding, work, and other transfers requiring significant attention. Consequently, the authorities are presently unable to address this matter, nor have they dispatched personnel for preparatory or liaison work. It is understood, however, that the authorities are highly desirous of adopting the opinions of the citizens, and the establishment of a public opinion organ is, in principle, to be granted consideration, and that further discussion will be undertaken when the concession takeover is more settled.</p>
<h3 id="e31">Sketches of the New General Benevolent Hall: A Grand View Garden for the Helpless; The Poor, Sick, Aged, and Disabled Bathed in the Light of Universal Love <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Love permeates the Disabled Ward</p>
<p>The Disabled Department is divided into male and female sections, each with around sixty individuals, occupying several separate Western-style buildings in their own courtyards. The female section, in a somewhat darker, single-story building, houses individuals ranging from just over ten years old to elderly women. Dressed in uniform blue clothing, they are all engaged in sewing something, and at first glance, do not appear to be disabled. Several stare blankly at visitors, reportedly unable to see anything at all. The male section is concentrated in a large room, seemingly awaiting mealtime. Their disabilities are generally more severe. One man's head is supported by a wooden frame, reportedly to prevent it from falling backwards onto his back – a truly terrifying sight. A handsome seventeen or eighteen-year-old boy has had both legs taken away by some unknown force. When the reporter inquired about his past, he choked up, unable to continue speaking, and tears involuntarily streamed down his face.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Hospital</p>
<p>The medical department of the New General Benevolent Hall consists of three separate courtyards. The infant ward, composed of several newly renovated single-story buildings arranged in a U-shape, features structures and small iron beds suited to medical needs. The children range from newborns to two or three years old, many suffering from incurable illnesses. Yet, as long as there is a breath of life, even knowing there is no hope of recovery, they are cared for as if they were their own children. Abandoned infants, often found at the doorway, discarded only when their condition is dire, are surprisingly often nursed back to health. Unfortunately, too many parents are forced by circumstances to abandon their children, while the resources of the New General Benevolent Hall are limited.</p>
<p>Besides in-patient care, daily outpatient services and medication are provided. With the arrival of summer, the hospital becomes a bustling hub for treating heat-related ailments.</p>
<p>Voluntary School and Kitchen</p>
<p>Relieving spiritual hunger is also part of the New General Benevolent Hall's mission. In addition to providing graded education for orphans within the facility, a free school for commoners has been established to provide education to underprivileged children. Unfortunately, with such a wide range of undertakings and limited funding, the school is small in scale and requires improvement and expansion.</p>
<p>To understand the food situation, the kitchen was the last stop. There, a foreign nanny was preparing bran noodles. A large pot, several meters long, was cooking the evening meal: congee and dried vegetable soup. Infants, orphans, and patients reportedly receive the best food. Ordinary residents receive congee in the morning, rice at noon, and congee or similar dishes in the evening. Aside from the children and the sick, everyone receives one raisin in the morning and a small amount of greens at noon, with vegetable soup in the evening. Despite extreme thrift, each noon meal requires six large pots of rice (each pot holding about five pecks of rice) to feed the thousand residents, truly a difficult task.</p>
<p>According to the nannies, the hall houses a total of 1,036 people. Taking 1,000 as a base, monthly expenses include 150 piculs of food, 10 tons of coal briquettes, 90 bundles of firewood, 120 bundles of vegetables, 24 bundles of pickled vegetables, 450 jin of bean oil, 600 jin of salt, 150 jin of soy sauce, 5 cans of kerosene, 5 boxes of soap, 600 jin of horse feed, approximately 2,000 yuan in water bills, and about 1,000 yuan in wages. The costs of treating the sick, providing medication, and providing clothing, repairs, and miscellaneous items are inestimable.</p>
<p>Difficulties and Hopes</p>
<p>The New General Benevolent Hall's activities, ranging from the care of infants to the elderly over eighty, and from education to medical care, are extensive. This makes management particularly challenging and expenses especially high. In the 31st year alone, actual expenses totaled 849,075 yuan. With prices now exorbitant, monthly costs total more than 100,000 yuan. Revenue primarily depends on the nannies' daily fundraising, which accounted for 635,373 yuan of the total income of 819,811 yuan in the 31st year. Daily fundraising, however, yields an unstable income, presenting obvious difficulties. After the establishment of the Shanghai Poor and Sick Relief Association last year, the Hall applied for subsidies. After investigations by Committee members Ju Cun and Bai Yun, and a further investigation by Committee member Ji Gang this spring, it was initially decided to provide a monthly subsidy of 20,000 yuan (from March to May). In June, a further subsidy of 60,000 yuan was provided. However, with continuously rising prices and food shortages, the Hall has reached the point where it can no longer discharge residents. To support this haven for the helpless, and to maintain the large-scale and remarkably successful New General Benevolent Hall, we hope that all sectors will provide more powerful assistance.

<h3 id="e32">Colonel Kamata Speaks: Dominating the Seven Seas <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>— Ye Wei</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 20th) marked the third "Sea Day" of the friendly nation of Japan. Colonel Kamata, head of the Public Relations Department of the Japanese Naval Fleet stationed in China, delivered a speech at the International Theatre, titled "Achieving the Great Enterprise of Dominating the Seven Seas." He forcefully argued that the rise and fall of a nation depends on the waxing and waning of its maritime power. Excerpts of his speech are recorded below:</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the concern of the entire 100 million citizens of Japan for the ocean has deepened. With the awakening of our Yamato nation as a maritime people, we have a deeper understanding of the importance of the ocean and have solidified our determination to complete the great enterprise of dominating the seven seas. Today, as we celebrate the third Sea Day, we feel its significance even more deeply.</p>
<p>The Significance of Sea Day</p>
<p>In this Greater East Asia War, what missions has our navy completed, what are our combat actions, and what unprecedented battle achievements have we achieved? I believe you are all aware of these facts and do not need to be reminded. The foundation of our comprehensive victory rests on dominating the oceans within the war zone. We, as a maritime people, must constantly recognize the importance of the ocean. The purpose of establishing "Sea Day" two years ago was also for this reason. Therefore, I will first elaborate on the significance of "Sea Day." On Earth, the area of the ocean is two and a half times that of the land. This vast ocean provides passageways for large ships to travel freely, and it also contains endless resources and treasures.</p>
<p>For a nation to be a true maritime power, it must have a developed domestic industry and flourishing foreign trade. The revitalization and development of industry must consider the convenience of water transport, which requires sea transport and the security of sea lanes, as well as shipbuilding. This necessitates extending maritime rights, protecting fishing rights, securing key military locations, and acquiring colonies. Only by completing the interconnected aspects of industry, water transport, maritime rights, and colonies can a maritime nation achieve its full development. All four of these elements are indispensable. If the Japanese Empire wishes to develop into a nation born of the sea, it must dominate the ocean. To dominate the ocean, it must understand the ocean. Even if the general basis of life is on land, one must still deeply understand the sea. The sea not only protects the land but also serves as a highway and bridge to foreign countries. A nation that only uses the sea as a defensive tool will never develop into a true nation born of the sea. To develop and prosper as a nation, whether in peacetime or wartime, one must revitalize domestic industry, build ships on a large scale, and maintain a strong navy and base (colonial) facilities. In wartime, all domestic industries must shift their focus to increasing military production. Today, there is an even stronger emphasis on increasing production. In terms of maritime transport, the scale of the Greater East Asia War is unprecedented in history and relies heavily on sea transport. The number of merchant ships required to transport the army, weapons, and military supplies is unparalleled. Therefore, the Greater East Asia War is a "joint operation" skillfully "combining" the navy and merchant ships to transport soldiers to the appropriate locations at the appropriate times. In this way, the acquired land can be used as a base for development and to increase the production of resources. Naval and land battles are combined with construction efforts. Therefore, the most important thing in this war is ships, the second most important thing is also ships, and the third most important thing is still ships. Now is the time for urgent shipbuilding. The enemy, Britain and the United States, has exaggeratedly claimed that Japan's weakness is a lack of merchant ships and that Japan will eventually be defeated because of merchant ships.</p>
<p>A Review of Japan's Maritime Development</p>
<p>I have outlined the requirements for dominating the sea. Today, under the Emperor's majestic power, thanks to the efforts and battles of the Imperial Army and Navy, Japan has occupied territory several times larger than its own and is developing into a naval power unprecedented in history. Let us now review the development of our nation's maritime power since its founding to learn lessons for the future. When Emperor Jinmu ascended the throne, he declared, "Combining the six directions to hear the capital, covering the eight strings to make words." This truly promotes the great spirit of maritime development. Later, our Yamato nation inherited this spirit of maritime development. Internally, we expanded cultivation and development. Externally, we managed development. By the time of the tenth Emperor Sujin, he issued an edict to build ships: "Ships are essential for the world. Today, the people on the coast suffer greatly from walking because they have no ships. Order the various countries to build ships," encouraging the development of the ocean. The fourteenth Emperor Chuai led an expedition abroad, and Empress Jingu personally conquered the three Han kingdoms, conducting a magnificent transoceanic campaign.</p>
<p>Conclusion The history of Japan's maritime development has been described above. However, studying history alone is only interesting and does not help in practice. One should understand and recognize history and spread practical interest in it. We must have this kind of common sense: more than half of the lives of the Japanese people are spent at sea. In other words, one must connect the sea to daily life. Whether for travel or entertainment, one should utilize the ocean. German leader Adolf Hitler believed that overseas travel was a privilege of the wealthy class. To enable poor laborers to enjoy cheap and pleasant overseas travel, he built several ships to cruise to Northern Europe. However, this was later recognized as the main reason for the success of the Norway campaign. From this perspective, neither continental nor maritime nations can survive without the sea.</p>
<h3 id="e33">Slogans and Taglines for the Thrift Campaign <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>(1) General:</p>
<p>Practice thrift; build the nation and repay its kindness.</p>
<p>Put the New National Movement into practice, starting with thrift.</p>
<p>Avoid waste, avoid extravagance.</p>
<p>Thrift is a good deed that loves oneself, loves others, loves one's family, and loves the nation.</p>
<p>Waste is a bad habit that harms oneself, harms others, harms one's family, and harms the nation.</p>
<p>To demand the liberation of East Asia and national freedom, one must first practice thrift.</p>
<p>People respect those who are thrifty.</p>
<p>People look down on those who are wasteful.</p>
<p>Conserving materials is a good way to lower prices.</p>
<p>High prices are caused by hoarding and smuggling, and by waste and extravagance.</p>
<p>Reform bad social practices by starting with thrift.</p>
<p>Those who waste resources are as hateful as hoarding merchants.</p>
<p>Those who waste resources are enemies of the masses.</p>

<p>"Friends of China" Share Weal and Woe to Care for Youth Mr. Yoshida Toyosuke, a "Friend of China," expressed his strong support for the scholarship campaign. Yesterday, he persuaded his friend Mr. Takeshita Fumitaka to donate 10,000 yuan to the scholarship fund. Mr. Yoshida also personally donated 1,000 yuan to this newspaper. His enthusiasm for caring for Chinese students is admirable. This newspaper previously received over 10,000 yuan in scholarship donations from Mr. Tatsujin through the Nisshin News Agency in February. The generous donations of Messrs. Takeshita and Yoshida at this time of East Asian cooperation demonstrate a shared sense of weal and woe. The significance is profound. We sincerely express our gratitude on behalf of the impoverished Chinese students.</p>
<p>Encouragement from All Sectors Is Truly Admirable The newspaper received letters from various sectors regarding donations to the scholarship fund yesterday: (1) Mr. Shen Erchang believes that the qualifications of Liu Xuanding should be strictly reviewed, and academic performance should be especially emphasized. (2) Mr. Zhang Peimian and others expressed their deep approval of students being able to avoid dropping out of school. (3) Lu Yunxiang sent a letter thanking Mao Qirui, the head of the fifth Jia of the sixth Bao of the fourth Lianbao in Chengdu District, and Peng Shuxun, a member of the self-defense corps, for escorting and delivering the donation.

<h3 id="e35">Factory Licensing Procedures <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council recently issued Notification No. 6427, stipulating that factory licensing procedures will be implemented from the 25th of this month. At that time, any factory or workshop that regularly employs ten or more workers, or uses power machinery, or whose work is dangerous or harmful to health, must obtain a license from the Council. If a factory is of a special nature and requires an additional license, a special license must be obtained in addition to the factory license before operations can begin. If a special license has already been obtained, a factory license must also be applied for. The fee for this license is set at 12% of the rental value used for the Municipal General Rate, payable in advance every six months, but the minimum payment for each half-year is 20 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the final day of the charity exhibition of calligraphy and paintings for our newspaper's disaster relief fund. The weather was sunny and clear, and visitors and purchasers were extremely crowded. Celebrities such as Yuan Lixing, Lin Kanghou, Qiu Yunqing, Ren Xiaoshan, and Gu Nanqun still came to support the cause as the meeting convened at 6 p.m., highlighting the attention the charitable endeavor has received from the community. Sales for the entire day exceeded 7,000 yuan. In total, the nine-day exhibition garnered the attention of all sectors despite the rain. The total proceeds from the charity sales reached over 100,000 yuan, which will be handed over to the disaster relief association after the sales funds are collected. It will then be transferred to the disaster areas. We also request that the association provide relief especially to the flood victims in Zhangjiakou. This is to create fortune for those who enthusiastically donated their purchases. Remaining items will be organized and returned soon, after which an announcement will be made. Mr. Wu Zemin not only donated a hand scroll by Wen Tianxiang but also donated 5,000 yuan. His sincere disaster relief efforts are commendable.</p>

<p>The Huatong Cup Charity Football Tournament, organized by the Huatong Sports Association, pits Lianyi against St. Portuguese in a best-of-three series to determine the champion. Lianyi won the first game with a score of 4-2, marking a successful start. The second act of the drama is set to unfold at Xuhui Middle School at 6:00 PM today. Lianyi will once again face off against St. Portuguese. If Lianyi can triumph over their opponent, they will win the championship. Otherwise, a third game will be necessary to determine the victor. The Boy's Reformatory band will be present to play music and add to the audience's enjoyment. Children from the orphanage will also be on site to help maintain order. The referee is Chen Jixiang, and the linesmen are Rui Fukui and Li Guoyi. Before the game, starting at 5:00 PM, the Lianyi Cup mini-football tournament will feature three provinces battling Xuhui. Both sides have dispatched their strongest players. This match will be no less than a final. It is uncertain who will emerge victorious. After the mini-football game, the main event between Lianyi and St. Portuguese will begin. St. Portuguese, having lost the first game, convened an emergency team meeting to discuss strategy. In addition to the original players Xu Erzi, Oliveira, W. Pantosi, Fuen, and Carlo Liqui, the veteran Shanghai representative Weiketai and V. Suo Ruo have decided to join the team. Weiketai has extensive experience and, paired with Xu Erzi, forms an impenetrable defense. V. Suo Ruo is known for his bravery and his ability to score surprising goals. If Gai En's leg injury has healed slightly, he can also play today. Such a forward line is unparalleled in its sharpness. As for Lianyi, after learning that St. Portuguese has adjusted its lineup with the intention of avenging their defeat, the team has invited the famous player Li Jiazhen, who has just arrived in Shanghai from North China, to help. Strategic changes will also be made in order to defeat the opponent and achieve victory. Song Yunsheng has recovered from his illness and will participate in the game, strengthening the center back line. The team's formation is now ideal. Sun Tui, known for his strong legs, has returned to his peak form and is the soul of the forward line. Combined with Xiao Gao's ever-improving skills, there will be plenty of scoring opportunities. When these two teams meet again, it will be a fierce battle, with the tension and excitement likely to be even greater than the first game. But who will emerge victorious remains uncertain. Tickets are 20 yuan. Tram No. 2 on Avenue Foch and Public Bus No. 22 in the French Concession both go directly to the school. Today's starting lineups are as follows:</p>
<p>Lianyi</p>

<h3 id="e40">Wartime Economic Awareness <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>What is the significance of wartime economics? It is to observe the environment and measure the future from the perspective of all wartime economic positions, holding a special insight and a long-term vision – not ordinary and superficial.</p>
<p>Simply put, so-called special insight and long-term vision means clearly recognizing the spirit and key of wartime economic policy. Has the "Outline of Wartime Economic Policy" not already told us? The first is to increase production, the second is to regulate prices, and the third is to conserve consumption.</p>
<p>However, in Shanghai, which occupies the core economic position in the country, there are too many shallow people, especially those who have obtained illegal profits. Their wartime economic awareness is excessively shallow. They believe that wartime is a heaven-sent opportunity for them to get rich; everyone holds the idea of "fishing in troubled waters" and "taking advantage of a crisis." Therefore, on the surface – for the sake of fame – they are willing to do all good things; in fact – to get rich – they are unwilling to do all good things. The result: on the one hand, they grandly talk about increasing production, and on the other hand, they desperately hoard raw materials, making production teeter on the brink; on the one hand, they participate in economic control, and on the other hand, they participate in the profit distribution of speculators, even directly engaging in speculation, making prices soar endlessly; on the one hand, they respond to the thrift movement, and on the other hand, they spend money like water, leading a life of luxury and extravagance, thereby contributing to the public's psychology of devaluing the national currency.</p>
<p>Such a wartime economic consciousness must not be allowed to continue lingering in the "economic Shanghai" of wartime!</p>

<p>The National Government ordered the reorganization of the China Merchants Bank, China Industrial Bank, Siming Bank, and China National Products Bank, all joint state-private banks in Shanghai. All state-owned shares will be received by the Central Reserve Bank and resold to merchants, prompting the four banks to become purely commercial banks. The capital amounts of China Merchants Bank, Siming Bank, and China Industrial Bank will remain at 4 million yuan, while the capital of China National Products Bank will be increased from 500,000 yuan to 4 million yuan. After the directors and supervisors of the four banks were designated by the Ministry of Finance, they have convened their first board meetings to determine internal reorganization steps and personnel selections, which have now been completed. However, shareholder affairs are still being organized, and business continues as usual. The internal organization is roughly as follows: (1) China Merchants Bank: Chairman Zhang Wenhuan, General Manager Hu Yikang. The internal organization is divided into the General Affairs Department, Audit Department, Business Department, and Savings and Trust Department. (2) Siming Bank: Chairman Li Sihao, General Manager Sun Ji. The internal organization is divided into the General Affairs Department, Audit Department, Business Department, and Savings and Trust Department. (3) China Industrial Bank: Chairman Zhu Boquan, General Manager Xu Mifu. The internal organization is divided into the General Affairs Department, Audit Department, Business Department, Savings Department, Trust Department, and Old Debt Restructuring Department. (4) China National Products Bank: Chairman Ye Fuxiao, General Manager Zhang Zhuru.

<h3 id="e42">Various Guilds Petition the Authorities to Dredge Up Raw Materials <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>The organizations of various trade guilds in this city are now transitioning from the preparatory stage of establishment to the path of formulating work plans. In particular, over fifty major trade guilds have completely finalized their internal structures, connecting through the federation of various industries in the system, and ultimately reaching the National General Chamber of Commerce. However, in order to solidify their foundation and gain the greatest support from the majority of businesses in the same industry, the guilds must strive to achieve results in securing the allocation of materials. The initial motivation for businesses to join the guilds was to leverage collective strength to alleviate or eliminate the material scarcity (such as raw materials for manufacturing) that businesses in the same industry felt. If the guilds fail to achieve their expected goals, they will not be able to maintain the trust of their members. Therefore, the authorities of various guilds are currently petitioning the relevant authorities to dredge up raw materials and allocate them to businesses in various industries, in order to maintain the normal production and supply of goods. As for the preliminary steps such as the purchase, transportation, and centralization of raw materials, the guilds also hope that the authorities will provide remedies, so that the entire production and sales process of materials can be placed under systematic control. If the allocation of materials can be achieved as desired, businesses in the same industry will have enjoyed the greatest rights, and will be even more willing to shoulder their responsibilities, such as price stabilization, commodity registration, and commodity transportation. Various guilds are also actively arranging these matters.</p>

<p>New wheat from various regions of Japan has been continuously shipped to Shanghai, and flour mills in this city are also preparing to commence operations, which will greatly benefit the future of people's food supply. Yesterday, our reporter specifically visited a key figure in the flour industry, who said: Currently, about six to seven thousand bags of new wheat have arrived in port, but most of it is damp and soft, and must be dried. Therefore, it will take some time for the various mills to commence operations. As for the flour mills in this city, in addition to the Chinese-owned Fuxin, Fufeng, and Huafeng, the Japanese-owned Sanxing, Laifu, and Huayou, among others, will also commence operations successively.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Trends in Chinese Stocks <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks were still shrouded in a buying spree, steadily advancing towards the peak of short positions. Around noon, there was a brief setback, but soon new and old investors absorbed the selling and pushed the stocks up again. Investor confidence was high, and stocks with small par values were particularly vigorous. This was because it was widely believed that small investors were common in this market, and the supply of shares was dwindling, which also contributed to the rise. Trading was brisk. Department stores such as Wing On and Sincere each broke through another level. China-made goods rose sharply on news of capital increases and stock dividends. Underwear also approached a key level, and Jinghua shirts and socks rose very sharply, while Jinglun also jumped sharply. In the textile industry, Wing On Textile rose again, as did Dasheng Mills Nos. 1 and 3, Rongfeng, and Xinhe No. 1. After the rise of Dachina Weaving, the buying interest in Hong Yuan Weaving also increased, and it even soared beyond expectations, but there were few sellers. Stocks such as Wuhe, Guoxin, Xinfeng, Fufu, and Fuchang all had more demand than supply. In the cultural industry, although buyers of Commercial Press, China Book Co., and World Book Co. were bidding at prices similar to the previous day, there were no sellers. In the new pharmaceutical industry, news of capital increases and stock dividends at Sino-French Pharmaceuticals also emerged, and Xin Ya Pharmaceutical rose more sharply. Wuzhou's progress was also rapid, while Sengyi alone appeared flat and sluggish, which was due to its excessive rise on the previous day. Nanyang Tobacco jumped, and Dachina Matches' purchase price soared. In the public utilities sector, Zhabei Water &amp; Electricity suddenly approached a major level, and the rise in Chinese-owned Electricity was particularly strong. Xin Ya Construction, Jiu An, Da Shenhua Real Estate, Tongyi Trust, Guohua, and China Investment all saw active trading. In the real estate industry, Lihua was rumored to be increasing capital, and buying interest in Xinyi was concentrated. Kang Yuan Biscuits and Defeng Knitting both showed their strengths.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Summary of Market Conditions <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Gold and Silver: Gold jewelry in silver shops. There were no changes in the listed price or handling fees, but trading was stagnant, and the industry was inactive. There was activity outside, but no actual transactions. Prices rose slightly compared to the previous day, and investor sentiment was uncertain. The price of tael silver has slightly rebounded.</p>
<p>Public Bonds: Yesterday, the market was slightly tighter, but still showed a sluggish and lifeless atmosphere. Trading was quiet. Most investors have already left for other markets, and the market is gradually returning to silence. Category C bonds were slightly better than the previous day, but trading in other bonds was more active than in Category C bonds. However, the total number of transactions was only a few dozen dan.</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth: Cotton cloth softened. Transactions were very rare, and prices were also compressed. Longtou fine cloth has returned to the key level, while Sijunzi Serge declined slightly, and Sanyang Serge also showed a decline.</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn: Due to the strict investigation by the authorities, trading was extremely quiet. There were no transactions in any yarns. Only 20-count Shuangma yarn had bids, but these were not real market prices, and prices were slightly compressed.</p>

<h3 id="e48">Old Topic Revisited: On Thrift <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— Jian Jian</p>
<p>The Greater East Asia War has been going on for a year and a half already. To talk about thrift only now isn't exactly something to be proud of, but today's thrift movement is being launched under a new environment and with a new meaning. Naturally, it needs to have a new driving force behind it.</p>
<p>What is this new environment? Due to wartime conditions, the social and economic strength of Shanghai and other cities is no longer what it once was.</p>
<p>What is this new meaning? We are currently in an unprecedentedly difficult period of history, and the national economy is undergoing the most arduous trial. The meaning of thrift is, naturally, all the more profound.</p>
<p>What is this new driving force? Given the current extreme level of hardship in people's lives, everyone feels the pinch when it comes to thrift. If we can tap into this, we will naturally gain the approval of the masses from the bottom of their hearts.</p>
<p>Shanghai has become a city of consumers. Wealth and poverty have reached extremes. The saying "Fine wine and meat rot behind the red gates, while frozen corpses lie in the streets" isn't enough to describe the distortions of Shanghai today. The target of our thrift movement isn't those friends who "don't know where tomorrow's meal is coming from." They have nothing left to be thrifty with. It should primarily be those upstart adventurers, those "upper-class Chinese" who "never tire of eating and drinking delicacies, never tire of watching and listening to music and dance, never tire of visiting gardens and dance halls," as well as those in the middle class. If the former are thrifty for one night, they can save the lives of several people. The latter still have room to be thrifty, which would benefit the nation. Shanghai isn't lacking in people who understand the principles of morality. A thrift movement that helps oneself and benefits others will surely be able to lead the people by setting an example. If this becomes the trend, success is just around the corner.</p>
<p>We have proposed the slogan "fresh, simple, and unadorned" in order to eliminate the bad habits of extravagance and luxury. Shifting the trends, cultivating a new spirit of vitality -- this is the most important thing.</p>
<p>Secondly, we believe that thrift can be divided into passive and active. Let's start with passive thrift in terms of clothing, food, housing, and transportation:</p>
<p>In terms of clothing: Mr. Xiao Heng said it well: "The dazzle of clothing doesn't indicate a person's character. A lower-class person is still lower-class even when wearing long robes, and an upper-class person is still upper-class even when wearing short clothes." Resolve not to make new clothes. Wear out the old ones first. If you don't have long robes, it's fine to wear short clothes. This is an enlightened view. The saying "Be mindful of the difficulty of providing even half a thread" is directed at us today. An editorial in the Shen Bao once said, "In the summer, four-piece suits without jackets and ties, like Hong Kong shirts, should be seen as ideal and reasonable summer wear. For Chinese clothing, we should promote cloth shirts and short coats, as well as worn and torn clothes and shoes. As long as they are patched up and clean, they won't be considered unseemly and should even be respected. The elaborate dresses and finery of women, especially luxurious ornaments, should be regarded as the special markers of women in improper professions." These words are worth bringing to everyone's attention again.</p>
<p>In terms of food: "When eating a bowl of rice or drinking a bowl of gruel, remember how difficult it was to obtain." "A rich man's meal is the same as ten disaster victims' lives." Not only should we think this way ourselves, but we should also teach our children to think this way. Serving delicacies and fine wines to entertain guests should be considered a matter of conscience. In weddings and funerals, we should be as thrifty as possible. If we can use the savings to support social welfare, that would be even more proactive. Chinese people mostly focus on the taste of food and don't pay attention to nutrition. This also needs to be corrected. We hope that experts will guide citizens on the nutritional value of coarse grains and inexpensive vegetables.</p>
<p>In terms of housing and transportation: Don't seek luxurious housing, and eliminate the gentlemanly habits of fancy hats and cars. If you have servants, reduce their numbers slightly, and don't be afraid to do things yourself. In addition, Lin Baisheng's shaved head is something that the youth of Shanghai can promote. In fact, a shaved head can reveal a person's heroic spirit.</p>
<p>The ancients said, "What comes in wickedly will also go out wickedly." If those who hoard and speculate make a lot of ill-gotten wealth, dance halls, restaurants, and all kinds of entertainment venues will naturally be crowded. Only if the spirit of thrift can be extended to these people can we say that something has been achieved. The key lies in shifting the social trends. Once the trends shift, they will naturally influence these people.</p>
<p>The above points are all about individual thrift. Extend this to others, from the thrift of individual economies to the thrift of the national economy. Only in this way will thrift have a proactive meaning. The key lies in the active advocacy of leaders from all walks of life. Public and private life should be consistently frugal. Government officials and business leaders should be the first to implement this, breaking the long-standing customs of extravagance and luxury, and boldly advocate it. Only then will there be a solution. Not only materials, but also time must be saved. School authorities should also be the first to shift the trends in schools, so that vitality and simplicity go hand in hand, making it a habit. When students graduate and enter society, they will surely have a significant impact.</p>
<p>Another aspect of lasting thrift is diligence and frugality. Diligence today means increasing production, and frugality means saving materials. Therefore, another aspect of thrift must be to increase production. Shanghai today is characterized by excessive consumption and too little production. If the authorities can properly solve the three problems of raw materials, fuel, and food, production can be greatly restored. Otherwise, merely being thrifty is still passive.</p>
<p>In short, by increasing production on one hand and promoting thrift on the other, with proactive and passive measures going hand in hand, the national economy will benefit. Only with a strong national economy can we stand on our own feet in the world economy and unleash the strength of our people.</p>

<h3 id="e49">The Essence of Literary Creation <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>— Ying Qianshan</p>
<p>Literature centers on creation and starts with creation. Therefore, the fundamental cultivation that the study of literature should provide to creation must be deeply understood.</p>
<p>(1) The value of an article lies primarily in the richness of the creator's emotions and the sincerity of their thoughts. This is a natural phenomenon. A truly excellent work—whether it is a poem, a drama, a novel, or an essay—not only cultivates temperament and inspires ambition, but also causes readers to be startled and silently captivated. For example, Yue Wu Mu's "Man Jiang Hong" says: "The valiant will feast on the flesh of the barbarians when hungry, and laughingly drink the blood of the Xiongnu when thirsty. I will wait until I have reclaimed our old mountains and rivers, and then face the imperial palace." The exhilaration and vehemence of these words can certainly elicit joy and rapture in the reader, causing them to slap the table at first and then stroke their stomachs in reminiscence.</p>
<p>In addition, especially in articles describing scenery and objects, it is even more necessary to capture the utmost reality and express the most profound subtleties. I recall that Mr. Liang Rengong had a very good ci poem about a scull (used for rowing, made of bamboo): "I remember back then, the silk whiskers trembled. Since you belonged to me, the green was young and the yellow was old. You have endured so many hardships, and suffered so many storms. Don't bring it up, bringing it up would make my tears flow into the river." It is poignant and moving, one can imagine.</p>
<p>(2) Whether writing a long or short piece, emphasis must be placed on meaning and expression. In general, people's writing suffers from two problems: one is the inability to grasp the theme, leading to excessive and unrestrained emotions that gradually become scattered, like a horse that runs wild, unrestrained and uncontainable, or like spinning silk, with a thousand threads and no way to bring them together; the other is the inability to achieve clear and effective thinking, so that when faced with a topic, one becomes stagnant, agonizing but not knowing where to start, and even if one manages to force it, it is done hastily, in a confusing and incomprehensible manner. The reason for this, of course, is the superficiality of literary knowledge, which is not sufficient to meet the standards of writing, and the lack of reading, which leads to a lack of application material. In short, the main cause is a lack of expressive ability.</p>
<p>(3) Writing requires the pursuit of truth and the revealing of inner meaning. Exclusive reliance on diction and flowery, embellished language is not enough to make an article beautiful. Conversely, an article that is plain and simple, but in which every sentence and every word contains its ultimate truth, is worthy of respect even if it is extremely plain. Next is that the creator must have a unique insight and transcendent judgment in narrating a certain event. For example, in the study of philosophy, one should be able to elaborate on its profound and subtle meaning, and in the study of classics, one should be able to reveal its subtle meaning and penetrate its essentials, discovering what previous generations have not discovered.</p>
<p>(4) Literary creation must also be able to move people. In general, a piece of writing that has merit in the world's instruction must have a potential force, a sincerity, revealed between the lines, that will make people feel moved upon reading it. It is remembered that Dickens' novel "The Old Curiosity Shop" which depicted the stories of Little Nell, was a sensation for a time. Later, when he was writing the manuscript for "Bleak House", hundreds of readers sent letters to Dickens asking him not to let Little Nell die, fearing that she would inevitably die. From this, one can see the moving and profound effect of Dickens' writing.</p>
<p>In addition, in our country's "Ballad of Mulan", the depiction of Zhongqing's mental confusion, Lanzhi's lingering emotions, the mother-in-law's abuse of her daughter-in-law, the loving mother's love for her children, and the brother's brutality, and the matchmaker's eloquence, are all fully revealed, vividly on the page.</p>
<p>(5) In addition to the above, an article must also pay attention to inner and outer beauty. The so-called "inner beauty" and "outer beauty" are also the combination of "literary substance" and "literary form." In other words, "it is not enough to have only thought and emotion, or only to practice words and sentences, to be called writing. It must be consistent inside and out, and the exterior must express the interior, in order to be called writing."</p>
<p>Liu Yanhhe's "The Dragon-Carving and the Literary Mind" in the chapter "Emotions and Ornaments" says: "Lead and rouge are used to adorn the face, and charm arises from beauty. Literary ornamentation is used to embellish language, and eloquence is rooted in emotions and temperament. Therefore, emotion is the warp of writing, and words are the weft of reason. The weft can only be woven after the warp is straight, and language can only be fluent after reason is established. This is the source of establishing writing." It is thorough and detailed, and can be used as our guide.</p>
<p>Conclusion - From the uncivilized era of raw tastes, humanity has progressed to today's scientific enlightenment. The natural changes and the evolution of human affairs are constantly improving. Undoubtedly, the development of human culture is in the same process, so the literature of the 20th century today can be said to be gradually becoming more detailed from simplicity, and gradually becoming more precise from arbitrariness. Although the literary world today is like the dawn coming, the dawn is about to appear, we are still not satisfied. We need to refine, we need to work harder, to complete that arduous work of revival, to reach the complete realm of "Truth, Goodness, and Beauty." (Qu Que)</p>

<p>I love the sun, I love the light. When the sun sets in the west, I am afraid, afraid of the disappearance of the light. I love, I love the red clouds when the sun sets in the west. She tries her best, working hard, to emit the last, undying light, as if to say, "The light will not perish!" Darkness is gradually descending, and the devil will swallow the earth! I love, I love the moment when the sun sets in the west, the powerful struggle between light and darkness! Darkness has won! I watch the sun set with tears in my eyes! In the darkness, I love even more the sun that has died. I am disappointed, I am worried, but after a while I am inspired by the song of rebirth! This is what the setting sun told me, "I will never die!" Tomorrow, tomorrow I will come again! Come again to warm the earth, the mountains, and the rivers! You are waiting! Work hard! I smiled again! The progress when the sun sets in the west.</p>

<p>— Yuan Ying</p>
<p>Mandarin class. The classroom is quiet, dozens of small eyes fixed on the blackboard.</p>
<p>Suddenly, someone shouted loudly:</p>
<p>"Mr. Tang…Tang…Tang: Wang…Wang…Wang Shanting...stealing…stealing…stealing things!"</p>
<p>Everyone could hear that it was Mo Decai's hurried voice.</p>
<p>The teacher immediately turned around from the blackboard, gently sweeping his long hair back: "Who?"</p>
<p>"Wang Shanting!" The voices of two or three people.</p>
<p>"Stealing what?" Mr. Tang put down his book.</p>
<p>"Big…big…big cake," Mo Decai said loudly.</p>
<p>So everyone laughed, everyone looked up and turned to look at Wang Shanting sitting next to Mo Decai…</p>
<p>"Mr. Tang," Wang Shanting stood up, a small figure, "I didn't steal! ...Mo Decai stole my…cake!"</p>
<p>"We'll talk about it after class," the teacher opened his book again.</p>
<p>"What exactly happened?" After class, the teacher led the two people into the office connected to the classroom, followed by a large crowd of onlookers.</p>
<p>"My…mom…mom…mom gave…me…two…two…cakes, I…I…only ate…one…just now…just touching…my pocket…it's gone…" Mo Decai struggled to shake his head.</p>
<p>"How do you know Wang Shanting took it?"</p>
<p>"I…I…found half a cake…in his…his…bed board…he…he…already ate…ate…it…look…he…he…has sesame…sesame seeds in his mouth!"</p>
<p>"What do you say?"</p>
<p>"I didn't eat lunch today, Mom gave me a dollar to buy…"</p>
<p>"Why didn't you eat lunch?" The teacher was a little disbelieving.</p>
<p>"Mom said there's no more rice, I have to borrow some…"</p>
<p>Suddenly, someone shouted, "Mr. Tang: Wang Shanting must have stolen it! He always steals things!"</p>
<p>Wang Shanting was always standing silently in front of the desk, wearing that old, oversized blue cloth worker's coat, the cuffs rolled up four or five times, revealing two gray-black little hands.</p>
<p>Looking at others, he puffed up his cheeks.</p>
<p>The case was very clear: no need to delve further, not even "torture to extract a confession." The teacher discussed it for a long time and decided to suspend him from school for a week, and write a letter to notify the student's parents to come and discipline him…</p>
<p>So, a letter was written:</p>
<p>"No. xx, Yongyuan Lane, Daxilu…Wu Shi Wang…"</p>
<p>"Teacher! Is this…is this…a night school?...Is it…" A middle-aged woman stood timidly at the office door.</p>
<p>"Yes!" One teacher, holding back a smile, walked to the door: "What's the matter?"</p>
<p>"I…I…am A-Si's mom…he…he is in school…, this letter… She took out the neatly folded envelope from the innermost layer of her pocket.</p>
<p>So, that teacher smoothed his hair and told this parent in detail: Wang Shanting stole other people's things at school, and, according to his classmates, he has stolen things more than once, stealing other people's pencils, erasers, notepads, razor blades…even: —</p>
<p>"He even steals the scrap paper in the scrap paper book!"</p>
<p>"Stealing things?…" The parent seemed a little disbelieving: "...A-Si wouldn't steal things! Our A-Si…"</p>
<p>"Don't make a fuss! There is factual evidence…Now the school is punishing him with a week's suspension…"</p>
<p>"Suspension?" The parent was shocked: "Teacher!…That can't be!…You teachers do a good deed!…Let…A-Si continue studying!…Tell him not to steal things again next time!…I'll beat this little devil to death later…"</p>
<p>Walking on the road, she suddenly felt sad.</p>
<p>It was more than a month ago, when the child was about to write in his calligraphy book, he took out a lot of scrap paper from his satchel.</p>
<p>"Don't throw it away!" Mom scolded: "It's good for the stove, firewood is so expensive…Does your school have a lot of scrap paper?…"</p>
<p>"Yes! It's always piled full every day!"</p>
<p>"Bring some back for me every day!" Mom said seriously: Save firewood!…</p>
<p>From then on, every day after returning from night school, the child always poured out a pile of scrap paper from his satchel first…</p>
<p>Thinking and thinking, she couldn't wait to go back to school to hug her son and cry, —cry for their bad luck, being bullied everywhere! The child is not allowed to study for a week!</p>
