<h3 id="c1">戰時中國婦女的責任 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>現代世界各國對於婦女的力量，都巳不再抱着傳統的觀念，而加以重視了。特別是在戰時，少壯的男人，都巳奔赴前綫，爲國效力，或担任重要生產，以協助戰爭，因此，後方社會秩序之維持，防空防奸之工作，交通工具之愛護，以及一般生產事業之參加，便全部委之於婦女。婦女界之盡忠與否，對於戰爭及國運，就具有極密切的關係。試閱今天本報刊載的「戰時世界婦女」座談，不論爲軸心國家或反軸心國家，他們的婦女，都已直接間接的動員起來，都已直接問接的參加戰爭。她們今日的主要任務，持別是軸心國家的婦女，第一是遵照政府的人口政策，獎勵生育，並盡力撫育，如義大利政府明白規定丈夫未超過二十六歲而年收在一萬二千里拉以內者，結婚時有得到一千至三千里拉之借款的資格，結婚半年後開始付一分利息，如於婚後五個月懷孕，就可延至一年半後償付，結婚四年而不生育，則利息就要二分，長子出生後可减全數一成，次子以下遞减，至四子出生時全部不必償還。多產之家，還有特別優待。德國也有差不多的人口政策。婦女生產多，被視爲對國家盡力的光榮。第二，是爲國家担任各種工作，如在德國依勞務總動員法，凡十七歲至四十五歲的女子，均須參加勞動服務隊，從農塲到工廠，實行義務勞動。在義大利，凡十四歲至六十歲的女子均須動員，因此有百分之五十在爲國服務。就以英國而論，凡十八歲至四十二歲的婦女，即使巳婚，倘無幼兒，均在被徵之列，女兵僅陸海空軍補叻隊，就有五十萬人。美國陸海空軍中也普遍徵用女子。至於蘇聯，依據史太林憲法，早就消滅男女的界域，女子一樣參預國政，也就遍佈經濟軍事各部門。我們看到各國婦女這種爲國服務的紀載，再來回顧中國婦女，不能不興天淵之嘆。</p>
<p>中國歷史上儘有秦良玉，花木蘭，梁紅玉等女次雄，為國盡忠，但是就目前事實而論，廣大的無知識的婦女掙扎在生活綫上，雖然一樣辛苦勞碌，但是對於國家民族有什麽責任？誰也茫然無知。甚至一部份受過多少近代教育的人，出了學校，嫁了丈夫，便天天尋思如何享樂，在家打打牌，出門看看電影，誰會關心到自己對國家民族的責任？當然，在學校裡，在機關裏，在正當的工商界裏，還有一部份茹苦含辛莊嚴地工作着的女子，但是比較起來，總是絕小的部份了。</p>
<p>我們今天要說戰時中國婦女的責任，並不奢望她們像現代列強的婦女那樣去參加軍隊，武裝作戰，也不希望她們爲國家民族而多生孩子。今日中國婦女的最大責任，第一是「儉」，就是節約。雖然並不能把今日社會上一般奢侈浪費現象的罪責，完全推在婦女身上。但是，如果婦女不能苦守節儉，尤共是一部份女子的虛榮心，往往是驅使男子走上奢靡生活的動力。更有甚者，還不免因此造成男子營私舞弊投機賭博冒險犯罪等事態。因此，我們希望我國婦女在此戰時，特別發揚中國古來崇尚儉約的美德，共同努力消彌奢侈浪費的風氣。第二是「勤」，就是參加生產工作輿社會服務。我們不一定要像列強的婦女那樣在軍需工廠，在重工業部門担任重要工作，但是，無論是大小工業，農產與畜牧，以及手工業家庭工業等，那一樣不適於中國婦女參加？進一步則慈善事業，保甲事務，防空工作，以及平民敎育，也都可量力參加。人人以生產，作工和社會服務爲榮，則中國婦女對於國家社會的供獻一定很大！</p>
<p>我們所要指出的戰時中國婦女的責任，無非是我國古聖先賢所以教女子的勤儉二字而已，沒有什麽特別困難繁重，不過要求全國婦女完全實踐，缺不是容易的事。譬如說儉吧，這一點每一個中國女子都很明白，特別是最大多數的貧苦婦女，已至節無可節的貧乏之境，然而有許多人對於節約認識錯了，往往只限於私己所有的節約，對於公物或他人所有就不節約，甚至生病以不治爲節約，以逃避公益捐募爲節約。結果自與戰時節約的意義違反了。叉如說勤，生產，也是不待鼓動的，但只是爲私己的生產，不顧對國家社會的利害。像火車上趕單幫的女子，馬路上揹大米的女子，他們那種機智，英勇，冒險和犧牲精神，如果移到於國家社會有益的工作，會收獲如何偉大的成就啊！所以我們今日要求中國婦女盡其戰時責任，就不得不注意以下幾點。。</p>
<p>爲了要是中國婦女盡其戰時責任，第一要使一切國家社會的事業機關，眞正爲婦女開放，使婦女中友才幹的參家負責的工作。第二，是切實推進戰時婦女運動，使各界婦女組織起來，有力地展開節約和增產工作。第三，是普及婦女教育及平民子女教育，使一般家庭婦女及貧苦婦女識字，了解大局輿自己的責任。第四，是盡力培養婦女運動的幹部人才，使担負起領導婦女的工作。此外，現在還有不少有志婦女，爲着家累，爲着兒女，犧牲了國家多年培植之勞，被束縛在家庭瑣事上面，這是國家的損失，所以，如公務員之加薪，托兒所之設立，使一般知識婦女出來參加國家社會的事業，也是今日急要之事。這就有待於賢明的當局之考慮了。</p>

<p>天羽總裁</p>
<p>致詞大意東京二十五日中央社電　日天羽情報屆總裁，二十五日在大會席上致詞，大意如次：日軍自開戰以來，巳佔領英美荷各國廣大之領土，積極從事物心兩方而之建設，由此偉大之戰果與飛躍之建　，使大東亞全域之政治經濟思想文化統一結合，並趨繁榮，且由此中產生偉大之大東亞文學。蓋此大東亞之歷史，亦即美學貪婪無　之侵略史，故如不將此東亞侵略者剷除，則東亞各民族將永無解放之日。英美雖僞稱爲”主主義而戰，　則乃以此爲口號，藉以　人同情，引誘中立國加入戰爭，且彼等所謂之民主主義，社爲次美人之民主主義，不過各以利己之立塲，僞善其辭而已。茲以英美對中國之態度而言　彼等唆使淪方與日交戰　俾　視東亞民族兩敗俱傷，幸而中　在　主席領導之下，國民政的還都南來，並進而與日提携，日方亦即將於中　所有之特權及利益完全交還，眞誠協力中國人建設中國，同時大部份中國人皆已　　英美之陰謀、與日本共同邁向大東亞之建立。惟渝方依存英美之迷夢，尙未覺醒，然英美視重慶僅爲一應急之工且而已，對中國並無任何誠意。又大四洋憲章中矛盾之處，亦不勝枚舉，其中　謂英美並無企圖藉此戰爭以擴張領士之野心，但本年二月十三日美海長諾克斯，竟闡明美國於戰後　佔領太平洋各島，及該憲軍中所謂之民族自覺精神，亦由印度間題而暴　其眞面目。吾人目下正在召開之大東亞文學者大會，將有新獨立之緬甸國代表及即將獨立之菲島代　參加，而印度獨立後派代表參加此大會之期，亦將不遠。本大會所負之盾要使命甚多，然尤須銘記者，即共同建設亞　是也大東亞戰爭一經　發，英美勢力即悉被驅逐於大東亞之外，現不僅於政治經濟方面，即於思想文化各方面亦均已恢復亞洲之本來面目。尺東亞之建設，繫於大爽亞文學之創造，大束亞文學之創造，何促進大柬亞民族之團結，蓋大東亞之建設與大東亞文學之創造，實且有因，之　係，各國文學之特質，應充份使其發展，更期待　有雄大構想優秀技術，而　合大東亞之人文學家出現。</p>

<h3 id="c13">英美進迫大陸門戶　德國增兵義國本土 <a href="#c13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>東部戰綫的重大性，大家固然已經知道。但突破西西里而進迫大陸之門的南方戰綫的重要性，也不能忽視。在　西拿登陸的美軍，業已隔五公里　海面，開始轟　義國水土。在喀泰尼亞比塞大等敵人後方海軍根據地，一部份登陸用舟艇業已集結終了，緊追於撤退的軸心軍之後，不稍縱時間，而擬在義國本土登陸，德國今後將取何種對策呢？這是全世界注目的所在。德國對今後的南方戰綫的對策，在前次希特勒大本營會議中，業已決定了第一階段，第二階段，第三階段的步驟。</p>
<p>大陸最後防綫</p>
<p>前幾天德義兩國外長會談，對第一階段的步驟已　極加以推進。德國首腦部的空氣，比較上次敵人在北非登陸時，此次更顯見平靜。雖然接連有墨索里尼失勢，放棄西西里等重大事件發生，但毫無狼狽之色，一切都在意料之中，所以極表鎭定。這鎭定從何而來的呢？蓋德國大本營的防衛歐洲的對策，早已妥當地擬定了。『德國把歐洲大陸的最後防衛綫決定在那一綫？』這在目前的德國是最高的機密事項，而爲其對策的中心。戰錢如其移至義國內部，何方較爲有利，在今日自然不能頂爲判斷。不能僅從純軍事的見地來判斷者，蓋義國自發生反法西的革命而內政大變動後，義國的痛苦尙未充分恢復，羅馬的宣言爲非武裝部市，巴陀利奧政府的感置等諸種重大的政治要素，在今後以義國爲中心的戰，實與有重人影響的可能。</p>
<p>英美種種企圖</p>
<p>敵人如其承認羅馬爲非武裝都布，而　馬區城的軍事運　　於停頓，則南義的軍事防衛力，必然大有影響。從此點探究起來，英美今後必然對義國進行軍事，政治雙營齊下的工作。目前英美在奎貝克會談的中心題，大約亦在於此。</p>
<p>在這種局勢中，左右義國戰局者，實有賴於蘇軍將士的抗戰力及抗戰意識，並　駐義國本土重要部份的德軍實力如何。關於這一點，與義軍共同作戰，共同防衛的前提下，爲了防禦義國本土，德軍當然大加增強。</p>
<p>至於這　駐屯義國的德軍，在南，北義如何行動，自不能輕於推斷。德方如其仍沿用以前的戰法，則在海空軍力佔有絕對優勢的英美軍。有　島的西四里之　中，壓迫軸心軍，自是當外的結果。時以海爲舞臺的地中　天地中，　有攻擊力的敵人，如其踏上大陸，則德方日有充分的目信與實力，一舉而加以潰滅。目在戰局中，德國勝利的機會，大概有如次三種塲合。</p>
<p>德國準備萬全</p>
<p>第一，東戰綫方面，蘇聯野戰軍主力將近無力而被殲滅的塲合；第二，轟炸英國本土成功而左右四千萬英人生命的塲合；第三，英美在歐洲大陸登陣的軍隊，至少被殲滅百萬大軍的塲合。據外國所傳，今日德國的軍事力，與第一次對蘇大攻擊的塲合相比，相當低下。但德國的實力，現在擁有歐洲中原三大強國的一切，殊不能這樣簡單地加以測定。德國的作戰，似乎一向以東戰綫爲重心，而實澈其對蘇第一主義。東戰塲二年來的對時，德軍已獲得了貴重的經騐，今日德軍之根本的戰爭方針。未必限於東戰綫第一主義。所以現在的德國，對於上述三種塲合中最有可能性之點，正作種種必要的準備，一等機會到來，立即後各方面發動，使不能脫逃。</p>
<p>自本年二月起，德國所發揮的澈底的國家總動員之效果，將見之於今後的事實。根本上的合作之改親與重整，對歐洲戰局之未來的發展，可刮目以待。從這見地看來，有一部分人的主張，英美的在歐洲登陸，德國是應該加以歡迎的。</p>
<p>但他方，如其這大陸誘導戰失敗，反有非當的危險。橫斷英法海峽的登陸戰，德國對此早日有充分的準備。此外，在巴爾幹方面，亦巳採取了萬全的對策。</p>
<p>但目前的塲合，這半鳥的前半端，從作戰上，地理上看來，幾與島嶼具有同樣的性格，把南義當什這種誘導殲　戰的戰塲，是否適當，這應該是德國參謀水部所判斷的事，我們無　如何不會知道。不過我們從西西里島上，會數德軍耐受一切困難　惡劣條件，抵抗英美軍達五週以上的力戰情形看來，英美軍的義國水土登陸戰，我們以爲不將像以前一樣順利進展了。</p>
<p>要佔領義國本士，至少需要五十個師團的兵力，其兵站補給，每月至少必需船隻百萬噸。先前我們已經見到軸心的特殊轟炸機航空部隊，在西地中海奇襲敵方護送船團，獲得了擊沈七十萬噸的戰果，嗣又在十八日襲擊待機於北非畢塞大港預備作登陸戰的大船團，擊沈二十二艘，十二八千噸，與以殲滅的打擊。德空軍地中海部隊的活躍，今後將愈趨激烈，南方戰綫的緊張情形，毋須　及政變的創痛，德國挾義大利以抗英美的軍事力，快要突入最高潮的塲　了。（翔；　自八月二十一日西部朝日新聞）</p>

<p>岡崎談話</p>
<p>日昨目本大使館情報會議席上，岡崎總務部長對於安定物價穩定通貨曾發表極懇切之談話，岡崎氏謂：關於穩定物價安定通貨，首在促進物資流通，欲使物資流通，希望商人方面能自動出淸囤積，市民方面亦應勿再囤積日用品，如此物資自然流通，物價亦隨之下降，通貨亦可因之穩定矣。至於此次中日兩當局之收買棉紗棉布，已獲得一般市民之特別關心，所以中日當局對此亦特別審愼，現正研究完善精密之辦法，因過去上海物資有不能圓滑配給全體農民之傾向，所以此次特別注意此點，研究如何方能直接配給農民，如果此項辦法成功，農民們因既已獲得低價棉布，自然亦將以農作物低價售出，物資交流之目的，至此乃得完成，又關於收買紗布問題，方法方面，日本方面並無強制收買私有財產法律，因此乃用勸吿方式，可是日商如有違反情形，則將受日本刑法之處分，故其效果與強制收買完全相同。</p>

<p>— 關卓桓</p>
<p>目前我們這班中下級的公務人員，因物價關係有捉襟見肘期不謀夕的情狀，這是無可諱言的事。試想公務人員每月所得低微的俸給，較之普通薪水階級尙有不如，不要說維持家庭，簡直連維持個人的生活都要發生問題，幸而政府當局對我們的生活異常關懷，極力提高待遇，但是俸給的增加有限，而物價的上漲却漫無止境，我們的處境可謂困苦已極，不過迴想到我們對國家民族所負責任底重大，就不得不處處退一步想，從艱苦奮鬥當中尋求生路，公務員合作社的舉辦，可說是目前解決公務人員生活困難的積極有效辨法。</p>
<p>固然，戰時國民生活的需要刻苦，是無法避免的，尤其在統制經濟政策尙未推行盡善的過渡時期。消費合作的意義，就是集合大衆的力量，以共同經營方法，謀取日用必需物資。以平價配給社員，如果辦理得法，對吾人當前的生活問題，未始不能獲得一部份的解決，環顧本市類此組織，僅有新近成立的市民消費合作社一家，事實上似不足應付目前環境，加以本市機關林立，公務人員數當不在少，倘能同舟共濟，協力籌設一規模相當偉大的合作社，相信於改善公務員生活一點上，定能收到絕大的效果。</p>
<p>關於公務員合作社之組織，謹就管見所及，提出下列各項原則以供商榷：（一）範圍　凡屬上海特別市管轄區城內任何政府機關之公務人員，均須加入爲社員，其名稱姑定爲上海特別市公務員有限合作社（或消費信用合作社），（二）股份　社股全額每股定爲二十元，每一社員至少認購一股，至多不得超過十股，認購之股款，必要時得由認股人所屬機關代爲繳付，以咨省便；（三）內部檄構以簡單爲原則，在可能節國內，得就各機關公務員中，遵選適當人員兼任社內重要職務；（四）辦公屬所　附設於認爲適合條件的任何機關內，務求减書開支，以符節約原則：（五）管理　合作社受市經濟局及社會福利局監督指導，由局方會同指定人員專靑辦理，爲取得各方密切聯絡計，並得騁請有關方面主管或專門人員爲名　顧問或理事，以便豁詢。（六）業務　以辦理消費合作業務爲主，可能內，應逐步舉辦信用合作及其他有關社員福利事業</p>
<p>其次，公務員合作社之舉辦，在良好的條件下，前途的展望殊可樂觀，試摘要說明如下：（一）公務員合作社爲全市各機關的綜合組織，與各方均有密切的聯繫，在物資騰　配給方面，祇要當局積極的予以種種便利及有力協助，成績完滿，定可預下；（二）公務員獲得平價物資後，物價之威脅因而减少，生活漸獲安定，工作效率無形提高，貪汚奸宄之風浸歸消滅，有裨於澄淸吏治，硃非淺鮮；（三）我國因傳統思想與習慣的流毒，公務人員平素缺少聯絡，各不相謀，有如一盤散沙，合作社之組織，促使公務員一致團結，共同奮鬥，成爲有力量有組織的集團，於經　生活外，更能同時改進　務員的鑲體生活與結合能力。</p>
<p>總上而論，公務員合作社之舉辦，實具有重大意義，且屬急不容緩，可無置疑，希望本市公務員一致奮起，促其早日實現，更期望中樞及市政當局能夠寄予深切的注意與同情，負起倡導的實任，將來合作社的組織漸由本市推及各地，不特我們公務員受到實惠，恐怕於整個國民生活的改善，亦有絕大貢獻呢！</p>

<p>「不患寡而患不均」，是中國自古一句經濟名論。配給的高貴原則，就是要使一　物資，尤其日常生活所需的物資，能够供應社會上每一　人的需求；所以，配給而言方案，自以「均」爲第一要義；其次，則當儘可能範圍以內，竭力避免其「寡」。無論米，油，鹽，糖，以至火柴等等的配給，皆當本此原則，製爲方案，既求其均，復免其寡；此外，一切足以破壞配給制度之行爲，如冒領與　報等等，元須於計劃方案之中，預作周詳之防範。在這樣幾個基本條件之下，自可求得一個完善的配給方案。</p>
<p>由於紗布收買後之配給方案，刻正在有關各方共同進行研究擬訂中，因而感覺配給辦法之能否圓滑推行，實有賴於配給方案之能否周詳厘定；假令未來之紗布配給方案。果眞不失爲面面俱到，處處顧到的一個方案，那末，一切物資配給方案，也就可以「舉一隅不以三隅反」了！</p>

<p>— 錢怕涵</p>
<p>廣文生涯，本屬淸苦，近年以來，生活程度高漲，本市學校敎職員處於層層剝削之下，衣食不週，內顧不　，爲家長者因子女學業之不進，而責學校師資之低落，既非仁恕之道，亦非治本之策也。今幸本市教職員起而組織消費合作社，以爲生活之自衛，鄙人昔亦執敎有年，深味個中痛苦，今爲學生家長，尤關心子女學業，深覺今日敎育破產，百廢待舉，而敎職員生活之安定，實爲今日切要之圖，故對於合作社之發起，實有相見恨晚之感，敢不揣冒昧，貢獻個人之意見期望如次：</p>
<p>希望全市敎職員能亟起加入，羣策羣力，則衆擊易舉，若置身事外，坐視成敗，則自誤誤人矣。大凡知識階級，利害輕重，勞逸去就，計較最工，今處非常時期，爲切身利害關係，應見義勇爲，一破文人之結習</p>
<p>敎職員各以本校爲單位，籌嚴密之組織，一切辦事人員，最好由學校當局撥派，而不須教職員負擔其薪工搬運之費，則總社工作自輕，開支可省，而敢職員利益亦愈厚矣</p>
<p>合作社成立之後，辦事應力求嚴整，配給則務期公允，俾能成爲今後社會合作本業之表率，從而據充至其他各界，協助地方當局之不逮，而使社曾受杵遍之利益。</p>
<p>希望地方配給當局切，並重視一般社會與論之同情，竭减予以援助合作與指導，若配給數量不足，希望商統會能作通盤之籌劃，給予採辦搬運上種種便利。</p>
<p>希望學生家長，及社會關心敎育人士，一致響應，予以實力之援助，除敎職員自行籌措一都份股款之外，各界人士，應慷慨解囊，共襄盛舉，而以中新兩報爲收集資金之機關，金融界亦望能予以墊款透支之便利，務使經濟周轉靈活。</p>
<p>文化界與敎育界有脣齒關係，所處受壓迫地位，亦大致相等，故望能策動全體，作教職員後盾，報章負領導社會之責，亦應主持正臉，鼓勵進行</p>
<p>深望政府當局，明瞭此項運動純正之目的，勿以政治力量干涉共內部行政，亦不藉　濟力量，而操縱其組織或利用其團體。</p>
<p>尤望友邦當局，能依　溝通文化，改進敎育之旨　，贊助此運動，　採辦配給各方面，給予充份之按助，並對於中國配給機構之措置，給予適當之指導。</p>

<p>為增强決戰下之生產起見，本年度的日本國民動員計畫，決積極動員女子，預料在各生產部門中女子的進出必劃一新紀元，佔國民半數的女子之活動力，確可說是支配着國家的命運。在世界任何一國，取男子地位而代之的女子之活躍，實足以驚人『現特向久居海外，見聞親切的諸公，叩詢軸心兩國，敵國，法國，蘇聯等女子戰時活動之狀况，作爲紙上座談會，以之發表如下：</p>
<p>義務的勞動服務</p>
<p>問：首先我們想從各國女子動員的狀態談起。用徵用的形式使強制服役的是那些地方？古內先生，德國是怎樣的？古內：根據勞務總動員法，凡十七歲至四十五歲的德國女子全部均須登記，這是本年正月頒佈的法令，在這以前，婦女們雖然未被徵用，但也已非常勤可說絕無僅有。不論男女，從十八歲到廿五歲之問，在未就職前，均須加入勞動服務隊到鄉村作數月的義務服役。德國女子的體力頗强，所以作勞力的工作時並不輸於男子。不論怎樣有錢人家的女兒，也都以勞動爲榮耀的事，而受助的農家也欣然接受服役。頭包紅布，身穿綠色制服，精神飽滿的少女工作時的姿態，形成農忙期德國農村風光之美麗的色彩。</p>
<p>問：婦女完畢勞動服務後，大都被動目於那方面的工作呢？</p>
<p>古內：任何那一種職業，沒有婦女協力的地方可說絕無僅有。除政府的公務員，紅十字會的女護士外，當信差和火車車務員的也爲數甚多。即在日本官營的鐵路局也已開始雇用女收票員了……</p>
<p>女飛行家得最高勳章</p>
<p>貝爾加：車務員須在公司的工廠中受七星期的訓練。最先是從機械的構造等基礎知識敎起。郵政部所雇用的戰時女子補助員，上下級職員一起約有九萬人。野戰郵政事務已大形增加，並且還擔任着和作戰地保持連絡的重大的長距離通信技術之住務。包裹的分送，也由女人擔任着。</p>
<p>問：最適於婦女的是那種工作呢？</p>
<p>貝爾加：我想精密機械的管理及製造，極適宜婦女細心的天性。開於飛機的製造，女飛行家亨納賴區女士曾從事極有價値的硏究，獲得最高動章的鐵十字章。做着這種和男子同樣的工作，而仍不失其溫柔的天性，這就是女士的偉大之處。</p>
<p>古內：德國的婦女，畢業女校後，就學習看護。遇到自己有孩子的時候，若有一點小毛病或受傷，就可以不必叫醫生而敷衍過去。我希望婚前的準備理該如此。</p>
<p>民力即國力問：在義大利，也有許多婦女加入各種職業部門麼？</p>
<p>吉浦：根據去年頒佈的國民總動員法，在義大利凡十四歲至六十歲的婦女均須動員。義大利的婦女百分之五十直接或間接在生產界工作，其中半數參加農業勞動軍需工廠，銀行公司的事務方面，交通機關，以及在　他種種方面都有女子在工作着，而小學的敎員八成是女子。問：墨索里尼首相的方針不是婦女胞留在家庭中的麼？吉浦：墨索里尼首相曾有這樣的一句話：「一國的國力在於人民的數目。」所以婦女的勞動成爲人口政策的障碍時，自然非設法排降此項障碍不可。因此實施着種種保護母子的設施。一方面不斷地生育孩子，一方面却也需要她們在生產界工作。義大利的婦女在家庭裏非常勤勉，尤其是農村的婦女，爲食糧的自給自足而竭力奮鬥着。法西斯的婦女團體中有一個叫做「農村主婦會」，淚這女校畢業的女子到農村去敎授烹飪法等。荒地的開墾也由婦女團體從事勞動服務。</p>
<p>法國的女子井上：和義大和一樣，法國的農村婦女也非常勤勉。一般人都認爲法國的女子虛榮必頗強，貪吃懶做，這是因爲只看了巴黎一部分的女人，而不知道農業國之法國農村女子的原故。就是巴黎的女性，實際上也極樸實，節儉，而勤勉。法國自從戰敗後，婦女的社會活動漸形組織化，維希政府的方針，就是想組織團體，把家庭的法國女性，造成國家的法國女性。問：那麼婦女團體形成活動的中心麼？井上：政府已將婦女團體加以統一合併，分成少女部和婦女部，以十六歲到二十五歲的婦女為會員，開始訓練。在祖國，勞動，家庭的標語之下，一方面使她們理解婦女在家庭中所佔有的地位，一方面使她們適應現在的時代。女校的教科書已廢去數學及外國語，着重烹飪·縫紉，及母性敎育，而科學等也以實用為主。家庭方面的工作，她們實在做得非常巧妙，例如把祖母曾穿過的衣服，改製爲最新式的時裝，得意地穿着起來。（木譯自同盟畫報十一卷第十號）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Wartime Responsibilities of Chinese Women <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>In the modern world, all countries have moved beyond traditional views of women's power and now value it. Especially in wartime, when young and strong men are on the front lines serving the country, or undertaking important production to assist the war effort, the maintenance of social order in the rear, anti-air raid and anti-espionage work, the protection of transportation, and participation in general production have all been entrusted to women. Whether women are loyal or not has a very close relationship with the war and the country's fate. If you read today's "Wartime Women of the World" symposium published in this newspaper, you will see that women in both Axis and anti-Axis countries have been directly and indirectly mobilized and are participating in the war. Their main task today, especially for women in Axis countries, is first to follow the government's population policy, encourage childbirth, and do their best to raise children. For example, the Italian government explicitly stipulates that husbands under the age of twenty-six with an annual income of less than 12,000 lira are eligible for a loan of 1,000 to 3,000 lira upon marriage, with interest starting six months after marriage. If pregnancy occurs within five months of marriage, repayment can be postponed until a year and a half later. If there is no childbirth four years after marriage, the interest rate will be 2%. The full amount will be reduced by 10% after the birth of the first child, and reduced for each subsequent child, until all repayments are waived after the birth of the fourth child. There are also special preferential treatments for families with many children. Germany also has a similar population policy. Women who produce many children are regarded as an honor for contributing to the country. Second, they are to undertake various jobs for the country. For example, in Germany, according to the General Mobilization of Labor Law, all women between the ages of seventeen and forty-five must participate in labor service teams, performing compulsory labor from farms to factories. In Italy, all women between the ages of fourteen and sixty must be mobilized, so 50% are serving the country. In Britain, women aged eighteen to forty-two, even if married, are liable for conscription if they have no young children. The women's army, just in the army, navy, and air force support units, numbers 500,000. Women are also widely recruited into the US Army, Navy, and Air Force. As for the Soviet Union, according to the Stalin Constitution, the boundaries between men and women have long been eliminated, and women participate in national affairs in the same way, spreading throughout all economic and military sectors. Seeing these records of women serving their countries, and then looking back at Chinese women, one cannot help but sigh at the vast difference.</p>
<p>Chinese history is full of female heroes such as Qin Liangyu, Hua Mulan, and Liang Hongyu who were loyal to the country, but as far as the current situation is concerned, the vast number of uneducated women struggle on the line of subsistence. Although they work hard, what responsibility do they have to the nation and the country? No one knows. Even some people who have received some modern education, after leaving school and marrying, think about how to enjoy themselves every day, playing cards at home and watching movies outside. Who cares about their responsibility to the nation and the country? Of course, in schools, in government agencies, and in legitimate industrial and commercial circles, there are still some women who work hard and solemnly, but compared to the whole, they are a very small portion.</p>
<p>What we want to say today about the responsibilities of Chinese women in wartime is not to expect them to join the army and engage in armed combat like the women of modern powers, nor do we hope that they will have more children for the nation and the country. The greatest responsibility of Chinese women today is first, "frugality," which means thrift. Although the blame for the general extravagance and waste in today's society cannot be entirely placed on women, if women cannot uphold frugality, especially the vanity of some women, it is often the driving force for men to live an extravagant life. What's more, it is inevitable that this will lead to men's embezzlement, bribery, speculation, gambling, risky crimes, and other situations. Therefore, we hope that women in our country will especially promote the ancient Chinese virtue of thrift during this wartime and work together to eliminate the atmosphere of extravagance and waste. The second is "diligence," which means participating in production and social services. We do not necessarily have to take on important jobs in military factories or heavy industry sectors like the women of powerful countries, but which of the large and small industries, agriculture, animal husbandry, and handicrafts and cottage industries are not suitable for Chinese women to participate in? Furthermore, charitable undertakings, baojia affairs, air defense work, and popular education can all be participated in according to one's ability. If everyone takes pride in production, work, and social service, then Chinese women's contribution to the country and society will definitely be great!</p>
<p>The responsibilities of Chinese women in wartime that we want to point out are nothing more than the two words, "diligence" and "frugality," that the ancient sages taught women. There is nothing particularly difficult or onerous, but it is not easy to ask all women in the country to fully practice them. For example, take frugality. Every Chinese woman understands this, especially the vast majority of poor women who have reached a state of poverty where they cannot save any further. However, many people misunderstand the concept of thrift, often limiting it to saving only what they own privately, but not saving public property or what others own, and even considering not seeking medical treatment when sick as saving money, or evading public welfare donations as saving money. As a result, it contradicts the meaning of wartime thrift. Another example is diligence and production, which also do not need to be promoted, but are only for private production, regardless of the interests of the country and society. Like the women on the train who are engaged in "dan bang" (independent small business), and the women on the street carrying rice, if their ingenuity, bravery, adventurousness, and spirit of sacrifice were transferred to work that is beneficial to the country and society, what great achievements would they reap! Therefore, if we want Chinese women to fulfill their wartime responsibilities today, we must pay attention to the following points.</p>
<p>In order for Chinese women to fulfill their wartime responsibilities, first, all national and social undertakings and institutions must truly open up to women, allowing women with talent to participate in responsible work. Second, it is necessary to effectively promote the wartime women's movement, organize women from all walks of life, and vigorously launch savings and production work. Third, it is necessary to popularize women's education and popular education for children, so that ordinary housewives and poor women can read, understand the overall situation and their own responsibilities. Fourth, it is necessary to do our best to cultivate the cadres of the women's movement, so that they can take on the work of leading women. In addition, there are still many women with lofty ideals who, due to family burdens and children, sacrifice the efforts of the country's many years of cultivation and are bound by trivial family matters. This is a loss to the country. Therefore, matters such as salary increases for civil servants and the establishment of nurseries, so that educated women can come out to participate in the cause of the country and society, are also urgent matters today. This remains for wise authorities to consider.</p>

<h3 id="e2">Solomon Islands: Intense Fighting on Munda Coast; Japanese Planes Repeatedly Attack Enemy Transportation Lines <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on the 25th: The battle situation in the South Pacific, centered on New Georgia Island and Vella Lavella Island, is becoming increasingly fierce due to the enemy's fierce offensive and our side's fierce counterattack. The Imperial Army and Navy garrison on New Georgia Island has been fighting fiercely against tens of thousands of enemy troops who landed since June 30, inflicting great damage everywhere. They are currently engaged in fierce fighting in the northern coastal area of Munda and the Baibai Ke area. Enemy casualties in land battles are no less than 10,000. The enemy, who previously attempted to land on Vella Lavella Island, has lost many of its transportation routes due to repeated attacks by the Imperial Navy Air Force. Only a portion of the force successfully landed at Biloa. Subsequently, efforts were made to reinforce the troops. The Imperial Army and Navy garrison fought valiantly while the Navy Air Force worked hard to prevent the enemy from reinforcing their troops. Aerial battles were fought day and night in the skies and seas near the two islands, inflicting significant damage on the enemy. However, the enemy's momentum for a counteroffensive should not be underestimated.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) - On the 23rd, a Japanese seaplane squadron discovered four enemy fast torpedo boats sailing in the Solomon Sea, in the sea area between Vella Lavella Island and Kise Island. They immediately carried out air sweeps, instantly sinking two of them, and the rest fled in panic.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) - The battle between Japanese and American forces in the central Solomon Islands is reportedly becoming increasingly fierce. Japanese army and navy soldiers are repelling the enemy's counterattacks and have repeatedly achieved astonishing results. According to the Japanese General Headquarters, the Japanese military's achievements since August 14 are as follows: On the night of the 14th, an enemy transport fleet departed from the Guadalcanal Island area and sailed to Vella Lavella Island under the escort of powerful warships. On the morning of the 15th, the navy and air force repeatedly attacked the enemy's transport fleet and warships five times, definitely sinking three cruisers, three destroyers, and five transport ships. On the night of the 17th, a Japanese navy destroyer fleet ambushed a powerful enemy fleet at the entrance of Vella Bay, severely damaging two enemy ships. On the 18th, the Japanese air force again bombed Biloa, the enemy's landing site on Vella Lavella Island, five times in a row. One enemy large destroyer was hit and caught fire, suffering heavy damage, and four enemy planes were shot down. On the midnight of the 19th, the Japanese seaplane squadron advanced to Vella Bay again and strafed four enemy destroyers with machine guns, repelling them. On the 21st, a joint squadron of Japanese fighter-bombers strongly attacked the enemy fleet in Biloa, shot down 14 enemy fighters, and sank and destroyed five enemy transport ships, achieving great results. The above is a summary of the confirmed results since mid-August, totaling the sinking of three enemy cruisers, eight destroyers, and twelve transport ships, for a total of 23 ships.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Japanese Air Force Attacks Chongqing and Wanxian <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Mori, Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on the 25th that the Japanese Air Force in China attacked Chongqing and Wanxian on August 23. The bombing situation is as follows: At 12:00 on the 23rd, an attack was launched on Chongqing. In addition to bombing the factory area there and causing it to catch fire, they also engaged with more than ten Chongqing fighter planes, shooting down eight of them (three of which were unconfirmed). One Japanese plane did not return. At 12:27, Wanxian was attacked. Bombing the docks and military facilities there caused them to catch fire, destroyed one large ship, and sank several small ships. All Japanese planes returned safely to base.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Air Force in China, for two years since September 1, 1941, has not attacked Chongqing. This time, suddenly at 12:30 on the 23rd, a joint squadron of powerful fighter-bombers attacked the military supply factory area in western Chongqing. All places were hit and caught fire. At that time, more than ten Chongqing fighter planes had already detected the Japanese planes were attacking, so they took off to meet them. As a result, the Japanese planes shot down eight Chongqing planes, including two (PF) planes, another two planes, and another plane whose type is unknown. In addition, three P/40 planes were confirmed to have been destroyed. One Japanese plane did not return in this battle. At the same time, another team of Japanese planes attacked the docks and military facilities in the Wanxian area along the Yangtze River northeast of Chongqing, causing them to be hit and catch fire, destroying large ships and sinking several small ships. Another team of Japanese planes searched for enemy planes far into Lingling, but the Chongqing army had already fled. All Japanese planes returned safely. Also, the planes that the Japanese planes attacked Chongqing and Wanxian this time were all Chongqing fighter planes. American planes did not participate and only took a bystander attitude.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese military used dive bomber squadrons to search the Yangtze River near Shanghai for Chongqing military ships on the 24th. Two ships of 500 tons class were discovered sailing about ten kilometers upstream of Sandouping. An accurate attack was immediately launched on them, sinking one ship and severely damaging two. After severely damaging a 400-ton Chongqing military ship about 100 kilometers west of Badong Yichang, all Japanese planes safely returned to base.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) - The Second Greater East Asia Writers' Congress opened here today. The main point of the oath sworn by the attending representatives was that the Greater East Asia War has now reached a decisive stage, and the rise and fall of East Asia is at stake today. We must be invigorated with great ambition and make the final blow to destroy Anglo-American culture. May God protect us, maintain the great glory of East Asia. No matter what difficulties we encounter, we will fight with an unyielding determination to win victory. We have become comrades-in-arms and blood brothers. For the rebirth of Greater East Asia, we will share life and death, love and help each other, to complete the mission of this conference.</p>
<p>General Director Amau's Address</p>
<p>Main points of the speech Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Information Bureau General Director Amau gave a speech at the conference on the 25th. The main points are as follows: Since the start of the war, the Japanese army has occupied vast territories of Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands, and is actively engaged in construction in both material and spiritual aspects. This great war achievement and leap in construction are unifying and combining the politics, economy, thought, and culture of the entire Greater East Asia region, and are leading to prosperity, and from this will emerge great Greater East Asia literature. The history of Greater East Asia is also a history of American greed and aggression, so unless these East Asian aggressors are eliminated, the East Asian peoples will never be liberated. Although Britain and the United States falsely claim to be fighting for "democracy," they are using this as a slogan to attract sympathy and lure neutral countries into the war. Moreover, their so-called democracy is just the democracy of white people, and they are hypocritically using words for their own benefit. Speaking of the attitude of Britain and the United States towards China, they instigated the Chongqing side to fight against Japan, hoping that the East Asian nations would suffer mutual losses. Fortunately, under the leadership of Chairman [Wang], the National Government of Chongqing returned to the south and cooperated with Japan. The Japanese side will also completely return all special rights and interests in China, and sincerely cooperate with the Chinese people to build China. At the same time, most Chinese people have already realized the conspiracy of Britain and the United States and are jointly advancing towards the establishment of Greater East Asia with Japan. However, the Chongqing side is still dreaming of relying on Britain and the United States and has not yet awakened. However, Britain and the United States regard Chongqing only as an emergency tool and have no sincerity towards China. Moreover, there are countless contradictions in the Atlantic Charter. Among them, it is said that Britain and the United States have no ambition to expand their territories through this war, but on February 13 of this year, US Secretary of the Navy Knox actually clarified that the United States will occupy various islands in the Pacific after the war, and the so-called national self-determination spirit in the charter also exposed its true face due to the India question. The Greater East Asia Writers' Congress that we are holding now will be attended by representatives of the newly independent country of Burma and representatives of the soon-to-be independent Philippines. The time is not far off when India, after independence, will send representatives to attend this conference. This conference bears many important missions, but what we must especially remember is the joint construction of Asia. Once the Greater East Asia War breaks out, the power of Britain and the United States will be expelled from Greater East Asia. Not only in the political and economic fields, but also in the ideological and cultural fields, the original face of Asia has been restored. The construction of East Asia is tied to the creation of Greater East Asia literature. The creation of Greater East Asia literature will promote the unity of the Greater East Asia nations. The construction of Greater East Asia and the creation of Greater East Asia literature are actually in a cause-and-effect relationship. The characteristics of each country's literature should be fully developed, and it is expected that humanists with grand ideas and excellent skills who unite Greater East Asia will emerge.</p>

At 9:00 AM yesterday, the team, accompanied by members of the China Youth Model Corps, went to the mausoleum of the national father to pay their respects. After the ceremony, they had a picnic outside the mausoleum.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency) - Sixty-four students from North China who participated in the summer training camp of the New National Movement Youth League arrived in Nanjing on the 24th. At 4:00 PM on the 25th, they were led by Mr. Xu Xiqing, the director of the camp management office, to Chairman's official residence to respectfully pay their respects to the chairman. The chairman kindly received them and inquired in great detail about the situation of the youth movement in North China. Then, he greatly encouraged the students for their efforts in this training and for promoting the new movement in North China in the future.

<h3 id="e9">Himmler Transferred to German Interior Minister <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency) - Dentsu News Agency reports: Himmler has been appointed to the position of German Interior Minister. This is a political development that has been rumored for a long time. Since the National Socialist Party came to power, Herr Himmler has served as the leader of the German Stormtroopers and the Chief of Reconnaissance. He is also well-known in anti-Axis countries, known for not appearing in public places or giving speeches. He was a participant in the Munich March and has been responsible for protecting the party from the beginning. Therefore, he will undoubtedly fulfill his responsibility for the work of building the new National Socialist Party. The reorganization of the National Socialist Party has always had a great impact on the Stormtroopers, and now the leader of the Stormtroopers has been given the responsibility of directing internal affairs, which should facilitate the reorganization of Germany after the war.</p>

<p>Stockholm, 25th (Central News Agency) - The Spanish government has been trying its best to keep Spain out of the war, but according to news from London, the anti-Axis powers have begun to take a more resolute attitude towards the Spanish government. Although the anti-Axis powers have always adopted a policy of reconciliation towards Spain, it is believed that they are now exerting diplomatic pressure on the Spanish government. One theory is that Spain needs economic assistance, and if the Spanish government is unwilling to abandon its non-intervention policy, the anti-Axis powers will no longer supply Spain's needs.</p>

<p>Rome, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to Stefani News Agency, in order to implement the official announcement of August 14 that Rome is a demilitarized city, the Italian government has requested the Vatican and the Swiss government to notify the British and American governments that the Italian government has taken the following measures and decided on the plan: All defense facilities in the city of Rome have ceased activities and high-altitude teams have stopped firing. Italian fighter planes have also been ordered not to fly over Rome. The headquarters of the German and Italian armies and their local troops have been actively evacuated, leaving only a garrison to maintain order. The Rome railway center will no longer be used for military transport. If loading and unloading crowds set fire or stop military vehicles, etc., there will only be one direct route within the vicinity of Rome. Finally, it has been started to move companies and military factories of military importance outside the residential areas of Rome.</p>
<h3 id="e12">Roosevelt and Churchill Issue Joint Statement, Quebec Conference Declares End <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Argentine Capital, 25th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Since the British and American representatives began their talks in Quebec on the 11th of this month, they have reached various important agreements on the anti-Axis political and military strategies. The talks concluded on the 23rd, and the representatives of each country began their return trips from Quebec on the morning of the 24th. U.S. Secretary of the Army Stimson left Quebec on the 23rd. U.S. Secretary of State Hull, Foreign Minister Song Ziwen of Chongqing, and other representatives are scheduled to return to Washington one after another on the 24th. It is rumored that British Foreign Secretary Eden has gone to Moscow with U.S. Secretary of State Hull. British Prime Minister Churchill met with a group of reporters after the end of the talks, but his subsequent whereabouts are unknown. Some say he will go to Washington, while others say he will return to London on the weekend, but there is no consensus. In addition, Churchill and Roosevelt issued a joint statement after the end of the talks, as follows: With the friendly hosting of the Canadian government, a war conference was held between the United Kingdom and the United States in Quebec from the 11th of this month, and it has now come to a successful conclusion. This conference reviewed the operational situation on all fronts of the world, referring to various events published after the meeting between the British Prime Minister and the U.S. President in Washington in May of last year. At the same time, the actions of the British and American combined forces and the army and air force, as well as various military decisions, have been agreed upon.</p>
<p>Three-Nation Conference May Be Convened</p>
<p>Regarding the complex operational actions of these army, navy, and air force forces in all parts of the world, it is believed that it is absolutely necessary to have a unified operational objective and method to guide the war in its entirety. In the future, the United Kingdom and the United States will intensify their efforts to fight against the Axis powers and will hold talks in a shorter period of time than in the past. Regarding the various matters decided during the talks, if they are easily published, it will be detrimental to the fighting forces, because the decisions are specifically designed to materialize strategies for winning the war. However, it can be stated that the theme of this meeting was to wage war against Japan and provide effective assistance to Chongqing. In addition, the unanimous recommendation of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to emphasize both the East Asian and European war theaters was also accepted and recognized. In addition, opinions on the political issues behind the war and the political issues arising from the war operations were also consistent. The governments of the United Kingdom and the United States have decided to convene other meetings before the end of this year. If possible, contact with the Soviet Union will be made, and a three-nation conference of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union will be held. In addition, a detailed report on the various matters decided at the conference regarding the war against Germany and Italy will be submitted to the Soviet government. The relationship with the French Committee of National Liberation was also discussed at this meeting. The governments of the countries concerned will also issue statements within this week.</p>
<p>Remarks to the Press Corps</p>
<p>Lisbon, 25th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Reuters reports from Quebec that the remarks made by Roosevelt and Churchill to 200 journalists at the close of the Quebec Conference yesterday are considered far more important than the final communiqué issued by the Quebec Conference on the scope of discussion among the political giants of the United Kingdom and the United States. When the British Prime Minister mentioned a "fixed resolution," he hoped that these decisions could be expressed as "large-scale actions." However, the communiqué, which was carefully constructed, did not mention this.</p>
<p>However, Churchill was more tight-lipped about the planned war in the Pacific. He declared that all preparations had been made for a long-term war, which is contrary to the quick-war plan foreshadowed in the communiqué. President Roosevelt said in his speech that the primary theme of the conference was the Pacific War plan, and that there was no need to invite the Soviet Union to participate in the conference because the Soviet Union had not engaged in war with Japan. From this perspective, the U.S. President clearly took the political importance of the Pacific War plan as a prerequisite, which has long been recognized by the general public. However, Quebec political figures know that the Pacific War plan is only one of the key issues on the Quebec Conference's agenda, and not the most important one, and that Foreign Minister Song Ziwen of Chongqing was not invited to participate in the discussion until the day before the end of the conference, which shows that the Pacific War plan was originally of secondary importance.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 25th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to news from Quebec, British Foreign Secretary Eden held a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Hull in Quebec yesterday. Another official announcement stated that British Prime Minister Churchill is scheduled to broadcast on Saturday afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e13">Britain and the United States Press Towards the Gateway to the Mainland, Germany Reinforces Troops on Italian Soil <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>The importance of the Eastern Front is, of course, already known to everyone. However, the importance of the Southern Front, which broke through Sicily and pressed towards the gateway to the continent, cannot be ignored. The American troops who landed in Messina have begun to bombard Italian soil across five kilometers of sea. In Catania, Bizerte, and other enemy naval bases in the rear, some landing craft have already completed their assembly, closely following the retreating Axis forces, without wasting any time, and planning to land on the Italian mainland. What kind of countermeasures will Germany take in the future? This is what the whole world is watching. Germany's countermeasures for the Southern Front in the future have already been decided in the first, second, and third stages at the previous Hitler's headquarters meeting.</p>
<p>The Last Line of Defense on the Continent</p>
<p>In the foreign ministers' talks between Germany and Italy a few days ago, the steps of the first stage have been greatly promoted. The atmosphere in the German leadership is calmer than the last time the enemy landed in North Africa. Although there have been major events such as Mussolini's downfall and the abandonment of Sicily, there is no sign of embarrassment, and everything is within expectations, so they are extremely calm. Where does this calmness come from? The German General Staff's strategy for defending Europe has long been properly formulated. "Where does Germany decide on the last line of defense on the European continent?" This is the highest secret in Germany at present, and it is the center of its countermeasures. Whether it is more advantageous for the war front to move to the interior of Italy cannot be judged today. It cannot be judged solely from a purely military point of view, because since the anti-fascist revolution and major internal changes in Italy, Italy's pain has not yet fully recovered. The declaration of Rome as an unarmed city, the sensitive measures of the Badoglio government, and other major political factors are likely to have a significant impact on the war centered on Italy in the future.</p>
<p>Various Attempts by Britain and the United States</p>
<p>If the enemy recognizes Rome as an unarmed city and the military operations in the Roman city cease, the military defense of southern Italy will inevitably be greatly affected. From this point of view, Britain and the United States will inevitably carry out military and political operations in Italy in the future. The central theme of the current talks between Britain and the United States in Quebec is probably also this.</p>
<p>In this situation, the key to the Italian war situation depends on the fighting power and fighting consciousness of the Soviet soldiers, and the strength of the German forces stationed in important parts of the Italian mainland. Regarding this point, under the premise of joint operations and joint defense with the Italian army, Germany will naturally greatly strengthen its forces in order to defend the Italian mainland.</p>
<p>As for how the German forces stationed in Italy will act in southern and northern Italy, it cannot be easily predicted. If the German side still uses the previous tactics, the British and American forces, which have an absolute advantage in naval and air power, will inevitably put pressure on the Axis forces from the four miles of sea around Sicily. In the Mediterranean, where the sea is the stage, the enemy with offensive power, if they set foot on the continent, the German side has full confidence and strength to defeat them in one fell swoop. At present, the chances of Germany winning the war are probably in the following three situations.</p>
<p>Germany is Fully Prepared</p>
<p>First, in the Eastern Front, the main force of the Soviet field army is nearly powerless and is annihilated; second, the bombing of the British mainland is successful and affects the lives of 40 million British people; third, the troops landed by Britain and the United States on the European continent are annihilated by at least one million troops. According to foreign reports, Germany's military strength today is quite low compared to the first major attack on the Soviet Union. However, Germany's strength now possesses everything of the three major powers in central Europe, and it cannot be measured so simply. Germany's operations seem to have always focused on the Eastern Front, and it has thoroughly implemented its policy of prioritizing the Soviet Union. In the two years of confrontation on the Eastern Front, the German army has gained valuable experience, and the fundamental war policy of the German army today is not necessarily limited to prioritizing the Eastern Front. Therefore, Germany is now making various necessary preparations for the most likely of the above three situations, and as soon as the opportunity arrives, it will launch from all aspects to prevent escape.</p>
<p>The effects of the thorough national mobilization that Germany has carried out since February of this year will be seen in future facts. The fundamental changes and reorganization of cooperation can be expected to have a future development in the European war situation. From this point of view, some people advocate that Britain and the United States landing in Europe should be welcomed by Germany.</p>
<p>However, if this continental strategy fails, there is an unwarranted danger. Germany has long been fully prepared for the landing war across the English Channel. In addition, comprehensive countermeasures have also been taken in the Balkans.</p>
<p>But in the current situation, the front end of this peninsula, from an operational and geographical point of view, has almost the same characteristics as an island. Whether it is appropriate to take southern Italy as a battlefield for this kind of war of attrition should be judged by the German staff headquarters. We have no way of knowing. However, from the fact that the German army on Sicily was able to withstand all difficulties and adverse conditions and resist the British and American forces for more than five weeks, we believe that the British and American landing war on Italian soil will not proceed as smoothly as before.</p>
<p>To occupy the Italian mainland, at least 50 divisions of troops are required, and their logistical supply requires at least one million tons of ships per month. Previously, we have seen the special bomber aviation unit of the Axis powers launch a surprise attack on the enemy's escort convoy in the western Mediterranean, achieving the result of sinking 700,000 tons, and then on the 18th, attacking the large convoy waiting in the port of Bizerte in North Africa in preparation for the landing war, sinking 22 ships, 128,000 tons, and inflicting a destructive blow. The activity of the German air force in the Mediterranean will become more intense in the future. The tense situation on the Southern Front, not to mention the pain of the coup, is that Germany, with Italy, resisting the military forces of Britain and the United States, is about to break into the climax.

<h3 id="e14">Food Items Will Be Under Rationing System - Okazaki Talks About Stabilizing Prices and Currency Policies <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Since the National Government implemented the wartime economic policy program, it has been rapidly studying and solving the problem of regulating prices and stabilizing people's livelihood. On the one hand, it is actively promoting the work of material control, and on the other hand, it is thoroughly investigating hoarding and speculation, cracking down on speculation, and curbing the rise in prices. Recently, the National Government has implemented the purchase of gauze and investigated the reasons for the rise in food prices, which has dealt a major blow to general hoarders and speculators. In addition to the current rationing of rice, flour, sugar, and oil, gauze will soon be rationed. In addition, matches, soap, etc. will be rationed at the beginning of next month. Therefore, the prices of various food items have slightly decreased in recent days. According to the forecast of a financial research institution, the price index for this month may fall compared to July.</p>
<p>Okazaki's Speech</p>
<p>At the information conference of the Japanese Embassy yesterday, Chief of General Affairs Okazaki made a very earnest speech on stabilizing prices and stabilizing the currency. Mr. Okazaki said: Regarding stabilizing prices and stabilizing the currency, the first is to promote the circulation of materials. To make materials circulate, it is hoped that merchants can automatically clear out hoarding, and citizens should no longer hoard daily necessities. In this way, materials will naturally circulate, prices will also fall, and the currency can also be stabilized. As for the purchase of cotton yarn and cotton cloth by the Chinese and Japanese authorities this time, it has received special attention from the general public. Therefore, the Chinese and Japanese authorities are also particularly cautious about this and are currently studying perfect and precise methods. Because in the past, materials in Shanghai had a tendency to not be smoothly distributed to all farmers, special attention is paid to this point this time, and research is being done on how to directly distribute them to farmers. If this method is successful, farmers, because they have obtained low-priced cotton cloth, will naturally sell their crops at low prices, and the purpose of material exchange will be achieved. As for the method of purchasing gauze, there is no law in Japan to forcibly purchase private property, so a recommendation method is used. However, if Japanese merchants violate the situation, they will be punished by Japanese criminal law, so its effect is exactly the same as compulsory purchase.</p>
<p>Stores Sealed Up</p>
<p>Six stores, including Shengsifu Hat Shop and [missing information] on Nanjing Road, were punished by the First District Office for violating the economic regulations of the district, and were ordered to suspend business for several days. Yesterday, a Central News Agency reporter specially visited the person in charge of the Economic Department of the First District Office, and he said: "This city's Shengsifu Hat Shop, Guanxin Ni Mao Shop, Dalai Shirt and Socks Factory, Shili Company, Gao Sanyi Paper Shop, and Shanghai Accounting Company were all found to have raised prices without prior approval, and after investigation by this department, were approved to be suspended from business for two to four days to show a slight warning. It is hoped that merchants and citizens will restrain themselves and sell goods in accordance with the regulations, and especially hope that citizens will assist in paying attention to stores that raise prices and report them at any time, so as to stabilize prices and stabilize people's livelihood.</p>

<p>The Second Police Bureau of this city, in order to increase the local security forces, will recruit all vacant police officers within its jurisdiction to fill the vacancies and enrich the police force in the urban area. According to a report from a Central News Agency reporter, the police examination has been scheduled by the bureau to be implemented at the Police Hospital on Qiaojia Road in the South City starting on the 9th of next month. Yesterday, a special order was issued to all subordinate sub-bureaus, etc., to strictly comply with it.</p>
<h3 id="e16">45th Period Household Rice Sales Certificates Awaiting Issuance - Citizens Look Forward to Speedy Rationing of Oil and Sugar <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>The 45th period household rice certificates may be issued today to the rice shops in the 182 districts. After the rice shops receive the certificates, they will pay the rice flour preparation section to exchange them for warehouse certificates and pick up rice from the designated warehouses. However, the quantity of household rice in this period is still awaiting formal announcement.</p>
<p>Oil and Sugar Sale Prices</p>
<p>The sale of the fifth period of household oil and the sixth period of household sugar has been eagerly awaited by residents for a long time, but the prices have not yet been determined. However, the general public believes that as prices are gradually falling, the prices of household oil and sugar should not be changed. Moreover, the raw materials for edible oil, the water year, can be said to be a good harvest, and there are continuous shipments from other ports, so its inventory can be said to be abundant, so there is no need to increase prices. For this reason, it is believed that the Changju will not approve any requests that may affect the rise of other prices.</p>
<p>Nanshi Household Sugar</p>
<p>According to Shangtong [missing information] news, the Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office originally allocated the fifth period of household sugar in Nanshi according to the population of the fourth period in the district. Later, the Buliang Food Bureau believed that the original sugar allocation was insufficient due to the increase in population in the two cities and the city center area, and requested to make up for the shortage, but because it did not first send a letter to the Shangtong Association, it was transferred to the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office to pre-coordinate the distribution within the prescribed quantity, resulting in no sugar available for replenishment for a while. The Food Bureau had to postpone the issuance of the fifth period sugar certificates again and again because the request for replenishment had not been resolved. Now, the retail merchants who sell household sugar in the Nanshi District believe that sugar is a daily necessity for citizens, and the district has been unable to purchase it for no reason, and the sugar quality is melting due to the hot weather, resulting in losses. Therefore, they specially requested the Shangtong Association to handle it. It is heard that the association has transferred the request to the City Food Bureau to issue the fifth period citizen purchase certificates in the Nanshi District as soon as possible to meet the needs of the people. It is also heard that there is a solution to the replenishment of sugar.</p>
<p>Flour Rationing News</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Machine-Made Cut Noodle Industry Association has sent responsible representatives to the City Food Bureau to request permission to allocate flour on a monthly basis. The bureau has verbally agreed to allocate 170,000 bags of flour from September of this year, that is, to supply 80% of the industry's total monthly consumption of 215,700 bags, with a selling price of about 300 yuan per bag as the standard. Once the industry is allocated flour, it will be distributed to members of the four grades of A, B, C, and D. Each family will receive an average of about 100 bags at that time.</p>
<h3 id="e17">Lianbao Injection Stations Close <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>The second epidemic prevention injection in this city this summer has almost been completed as of yesterday. According to a Datong News Agency reporter's inquiry to the health authorities, it is not planned to conduct another general injection within the water year after this injection. However, the authorities still hope that residents will take care of themselves and prevent cholera from occurring this year. Currently, each district's Lianbao Injection Station is scheduled to be closed after the injection date.</p>
<p>Nanshi Epidemic Prevention Ends Next Month</p>
<p>Since all citizens in the Nanshi District have been forced to undergo injections, there has been no epidemic outbreak even though the autumn sun is approaching, which shows that this year's epidemic prevention measures have achieved significant results. According to a report from a Central News Agency reporter, the district's epidemic prevention campaign is scheduled to end at the end of next month.</p>
<p>Seventy-Six People Died of Typhoid Fever</p>
<p>According to a report from the Japanese Consulate, 76 people died of typhoid fever last month, and 142 people suffered from dysentery, but there was no cholera outbreak, which is very satisfactory. Among the 142 dysentery patients, a total of 31 people died.</p>

<h3 id="e18">My Views on Establishing a Civil Servants' Cooperative in This City <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>- Guan Zhuohuan</p>
<p>At present, we, the middle and lower-level civil servants, are in a state of financial straits due to the relationship between prices, and we cannot plan for the evening. This is an undeniable fact. Just imagine that the meager salaries of civil servants are even less than those of ordinary salaried classes. Not to mention maintaining a family, it is simply a problem to maintain one's personal life. Fortunately, the government authorities are extremely concerned about our lives and are trying their best to improve our treatment. However, the increase in salaries is limited, while the rise in prices is endless. Our situation can be described as extremely difficult. However, when we think of the great responsibility we bear to the country and the nation, we have to take a step back and seek a way out through hard struggle. The establishment of a civil servants' cooperative can be said to be a positive and effective way to solve the living difficulties of civil servants at present.</p>
<p>Of course, the need for austerity in the national life during wartime is unavoidable, especially in the transitional period when the policy of economic control has not yet been fully implemented. The meaning of consumer cooperation is to gather the strength of the masses to jointly operate and seek daily necessities. If it is handled properly, it may not be possible to solve a part of our current living problems. Looking around the city, there is only one such organization, the newly established Citizens' Consumer Cooperative, which in fact seems insufficient to cope with the current environment. In addition, there are many institutions in the city, and the number of civil servants should not be small. If we can work together and jointly establish a cooperative of considerable scale, I believe that it will definitely have a great effect on improving the lives of civil servants.</p>
<p>Regarding the organization of the civil servants' cooperative, I would like to put forward the following principles for discussion based on my humble opinions: (1) Scope: All civil servants of any government agency within the jurisdiction of Shanghai Special City must join as members. The name is tentatively set as Shanghai Special City Civil Servants' Limited Cooperative (or Consumer Credit Cooperative). (2) Shares: The full amount of each share is set at 20 yuan. Each member must subscribe for at least one share, and no more than ten shares. If necessary, the share payment may be paid by the agency to which the subscriber belongs for convenience. (3) The internal structure should be simple in principle. Within the possible economy, appropriate personnel may be selected from civil servants of various agencies to serve concurrently in important positions within the cooperative. (4) The office location should be attached to any agency that is considered to meet the conditions, in order to reduce expenses and comply with the principle of frugality. (5) Management: The cooperative is supervised and guided by the Municipal Economic Bureau and the Social Welfare Bureau. Personnel designated by the bureau will be responsible for handling the matter. In order to obtain close contact with all parties, relevant supervisors or specialists may be invited to serve as nominal consultants or directors to seek advice. (6) Business: The main focus is on consumer cooperation business. Within the possible, credit cooperation and other welfare undertakings related to members should be gradually carried out.</p>
<p>Secondly, the establishment of a civil servants' cooperative has a very optimistic prospect under good conditions. A brief description is as follows: (1) The civil servants' cooperative is a comprehensive organization of various agencies in the city and has close ties with all parties. As long as the authorities actively provide various conveniences and powerful assistance in the allocation of material supplies, the results will be satisfactory and can be expected in advance. (2) After civil servants obtain fair-priced materials, the threat of prices is reduced, their lives gradually become stable, their work efficiency is invisibly improved, and the wind of corruption and profiteering is gradually eliminated, which is conducive to clarifying officialdom, which is by no means insignificant. (3) Due to the traditional thinking and habits of China, civil servants usually lack contact with each other and do not conspire with each other, like a plate of loose sand. The organization of the cooperative promotes the unity of civil servants, works together, and becomes a powerful and organized group. In addition to economic life, it can also simultaneously improve the community life and cohesion ability of civil servants.</p>
<p>In summary, the establishment of a civil servants' cooperative is of great significance and is urgently needed. There is no doubt that it is hoped that the civil servants of this city will rise up together and promote its early realization. It is even hoped that the central authorities and the municipal authorities will pay close attention and sympathy and take on the responsibility of advocating it. In the future, the organization of the cooperative will gradually be extended from this city to various places. Not only will our civil servants receive real benefits, but it is feared that it will also make a great contribution to the improvement of the entire national life!</p>
<h3 id="e19">Building a Greater Shanghai - Road Administration Will Be Reformed <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Since the recovery of the concessions, the authorities have a comprehensive plan for construction work, and strive to make Shanghai a good city. Regarding construction, the authorities will start with rectifying the road administration. According to the city's roads, many have been in disrepair for a long time, which not only hinders the appearance, but also has disadvantages for traffic. The public works authorities have begun to repair the broken road surfaces, and the damaged sidewalks are also being repaired.</p>
<p>Thoroughly Improve Drainage Engineering</p>
<p>Due to the excessive number of tall buildings in the city, the pressure on the road surface is very high. Over time, it gradually sinks, so that whenever there is heavy rain and the Pujiang tide is high, the roads are often flooded into ditches, traffic is blocked, and citizens suffer inconvenience. In order to remedy this, the authorities will thoroughly improve the drainage engineering, dredge the city's sewers, or rebuild them, so that rainwater can be quickly drained away.</p>
<p>Old Houses Ordered to Be Rebuilt</p>
<p>There are many houses in the city that have been in disrepair for a long time, which is very dangerous. The authorities believe that this kind of house directly endangers the lives and property of citizens, and should be repaired or rebuilt as soon as possible. The authorities have begun to investigate. If the old house is too old, the owner will be warned to rebuild it. In addition, the signs, advertisements, neon lights, etc. of the store must also be inspected at any time to see if they are firm, so as not to fall and injure pedestrians.</p>

<h3 id="e34">Rationing Plan <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>"It is not poverty that we fear, but inequality," is a famous economic saying from ancient China. The noble principle of rationing is to enable a portion of materials, especially those needed for daily life, to be supplied to everyone in society. Therefore, the most important element in any rationing plan is "equality." Secondly, efforts should be made to avoid "scarcity" as much as possible. Whether it is the rationing of rice, oil, salt, sugar, or even matches, all should be based on this principle, making plans that strive for both equality and the avoidance of scarcity. In addition, all actions that could undermine the rationing system, such as fraudulent claims and reporting, must be thoroughly prevented in the planning stage. Under these basic conditions, a perfect rationing plan can be achieved.</p>
<p>As the rationing plan for gauze and cloth after the purchase is currently being jointly studied and drafted by relevant parties, it is felt that the smooth implementation of the rationing method depends on whether the rationing plan can be carefully determined. If the future gauze and cloth rationing plan is truly comprehensive and considerate in all aspects, then all material rationing plans can "infer the other three corners from one corner."</p>
<h3 id="e35">After the Arrival of Production Materials, All Factories Will Commence Operation to Increase Spot Supply and Suppress Prices <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Factories in this city, such as textile, flour, oil, match, silk reeling factories, and other chemical and finished industrial product factories, will soon generally return to normal, starting production day and night to increase the supply of spot goods, suppress prices. If there is a surplus in consumption, it can be used to exchange goods with other places. The relevant departments are trying to facilitate the flow of raw materials.</p>
<p>Textiles</p>
<p>In the textile industry, a total of 67 factories managed by the military have been returned to Chinese management. After the military management is lifted, efforts are actively made to start operations as usual. Cotton, the raw material required, is being planned and prepared for extensive collection by the relevant parties such as the Cotton Industry Special Committee and the Cotton Industry Association. In order to encourage farmers to increase cotton production and sell cotton as much as possible, it is planned to moderately increase the purchase price of raw cotton so that farmers are happy to sell cotton, and the government agencies should also try their best to provide the textile factories with a sufficient supply of raw materials.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>Wheat needed for flour milling is monopolized and purchased by the Flour and Wheat Special Committee, which formulates a unified plan to supervise and manage wheat merchants, purchasing from producing areas at officially set prices. The purchase work has now come to an end. The purchased wheat is centrally collected and transported to flour mills in various regions to start manufacturing. The distribution and sale of finished products have now begun in various regions. The total distribution quantity, including the three provinces, is more than 30,000 per day. The distributed manufacturers purchase legally at a market price of 2%.</p>
<p>Oil</p>
<p>The raw materials required by the oil industry are soybeans, rapeseed, and peanuts. The current main persons in charge are the Oil and Grain Special Committee, the Poultry Oil Industry Association, and the Oil Industry Association, especially the Special Committee is the institution that has the overall responsibility. Soybeans are the main abundant produce of Manchuria, and in the past they were transported to Shanghai continuously. Now, due to transportation issues, there are many difficulties. What the authorities are currently considering is how to exchange the surplus materials of Central China with Manchuria for soybeans. The rapeseed issue is relatively simple. Peanuts are also mostly produced in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, and can be harvested next month. It is estimated that the output of Jiangsu and Anhui provinces can reach 16.5 million in volume, and the highest in Zhejiang province is 22.3 million in volume. After harvesting and transporting to Shanghai, it can be distributed to oil mills for oil extraction.</p>
<p>Matches</p>
<p>The matter of match rationing per capita is currently being submitted to the authorities for instructions on how to proceed and will be implemented soon. If rationing per day becomes a reality, the production volume of the factory can be appropriately controlled, and obtaining raw materials can also be further simplified. This matter is handled jointly by the Match Industry Association and the Japanese Match Control Agency. As for silk reeling factories, the silk cocoon purchasing work is progressing smoothly. When purchasing spring cocoons this year, loans were provided by banks, and the results were very satisfactory.</p>
<p>Flour mills have all received a considerable amount of wheat. Regarding the rationing plan, the flour bran rationing plan has been drafted and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and maintenance. Flour bran in various parts of Shanghai will also be available in the near future.</p>
<h3 id="e36">Commercial Control Association Specifies Regulations for Transportation of Pigments and Dyes <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Merchants in the pigment and dye industry are somewhat unclear about the movement of pigments and dyes, and they have been asking the Commercial Control Association for information. According to the association:</p>
<p>Pigments</p>
<p>It is not necessary to apply for a permit for transportation from the Shanghai area to within the three provinces and two cities, but transportation from the three provinces and two cities to South China and North China must follow the prescribed procedures. First, obtain a permit from the competent authorities of the destination, and then apply to the association for the issuance of a shipping approval before transportation can be started.</p>
<p>Dyes</p>
<p>The situation is slightly different. In addition to following the same procedures as pigments for transportation from the three provinces and two cities to South China and North China, permission must also be obtained for transportation from the Shanghai area to within the three provinces and two cities before transportation can be carried out.</p>
<p>Activities of Various Industry Associations</p>
<p>Fertilizer Industry: The "Shanghai Special City Fertilizer Industry Association" held its inaugural meeting at the City Chamber of Commerce yesterday, with more than 200 industry representatives attending.

<h3 id="e37">Trends in Chinese Stocks <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Chinese stocks launched an upward buying spree in the afternoon, accelerating their advance. Investors moved on the opportunity. There was a consensus upward trend in all sectors, and there was a sense that there were not enough shares to distribute. There is a possibility of rising prices in the future as things fluctuate. The stocks of established companies with excellent credit are the most sought after. For example, Wing On Company in the department store industry has continued to rise. The upward trend continued in the afternoon. Sincere (New) rose even higher as buyers scrambled to get it. The rise in domestically produced goods was slower. Underwear was the most sought after. Buyers raised their bids again in the afternoon. Jingfu Shirts and Socks had strong trading. Jinglun stopped falling and also recovered.

With the news of Tianlun's capital increase, the buying was relatively general. Hongsheng, Dachunghua Weaving, and Lunhua all made progress, and Sanyou Industrial also stood firm. In the pharmaceutical industry, New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory was the most vigorous, with demand still exceeding supply. China France also rose sharply.

<h3 id="e40">Statements from Teachers' Consumer Cooperatives and Students' Parents <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>— Qian Pahhan</p>
<p>The teaching profession has always been humble, and in recent years, the cost of living has risen. Teachers in this city are under layers of exploitation, lacking adequate clothing and food. Those who are parents blame the decline in the quality of teachers in schools for the lack of progress of their children, which is neither a benevolent nor a fundamental solution. Now, fortunately, teachers in this city have risen up to organize consumer cooperatives to defend their livelihoods. I was once a teacher for many years, and I deeply tasted the pain in it. Now, as a parent of students, I am especially concerned about the academic performance of my children. I deeply feel that education is bankrupt, and everything needs to be restored. The stability of teachers' lives is essential today, so I feel that the establishment of the cooperative is a long-awaited thing. I would like to venture to contribute my personal opinions and expectations as follows:</p>
<p>It is hoped that all teachers in the city can join forces quickly, gather their strength, and achieve success easily. If they stay out of it and sit and watch success or failure, they will only harm themselves and others. In general, the intellectual class is most calculating about the weight of interests, the ease and difficulty of labor, and where to go and stay. Now, in this extraordinary period, for the sake of their own interests, they should see righteousness and act bravely, and break the habits of intellectuals.</p>
<p>Teachers should organize a close-knit organization in each school as a unit. All staff members should preferably be allocated by the school authorities, and teachers should not have to bear the cost of their salaries and transportation expenses, so that the work of the general office can be lightened, expenses can be saved, and the benefits for teachers can be greater.</p>
<p>After the establishment of the cooperative, the work should be rigorous, and the distribution should be fair, so that it can become a model for future social cooperation, and then be promoted to other sectors to assist the local authorities in their shortcomings and to spread the benefits to the community.</p>
<p>It is hoped that the local rationing authorities will pay close attention to the sympathy of general social discourse and reduce and provide assistance, cooperation, and guidance. If the amount of rationing is insufficient, it is hoped that the Commercial Control Association can make overall plans and provide various conveniences in procurement and transportation.</p>
<p>It is hoped that students' parents and people in the society who care about education will respond together and provide practical assistance. In addition to teachers raising a share of the funds themselves, people from all walks of life should donate generously and work together for the great cause, and the Zhongxin and Xinbao newspapers should serve as institutions for collecting funds. It is also hoped that the financial sector can provide convenience for advances and overdrafts so that economic turnover is flexible.</p>
<p>The cultural and educational circles have a close relationship, and the oppressed situation they are in is also roughly the same, so it is hoped that the entire community can be mobilized to be the backup for teachers. Newspapers bear the responsibility of leading society and should also uphold justice and encourage progress.</p>
<p>It is deeply hoped that the government authorities will understand the pure purpose of this movement and not interfere in its internal administration with political power, nor manipulate its organization or use its group with economic power.</p>
<p>In particular, it is hoped that friendly authorities will be able to promote this movement in accordance with the principles of communicating culture and improving education, providing full assistance in procurement and distribution, and providing appropriate guidance to the Chinese distribution institutions.</p>

<p>In order to enhance production under the decisive battle, this year's Japanese national mobilization plan has decided to actively mobilize women. It is expected that women's entry into various production sectors will mark a new era. The activity of women, who account for half of the population, can indeed be said to dominate the fate of the country. In any country in the world, the active role of women who take the place of men is truly astonishing. We are now asking gentlemen who have lived abroad for a long time and have first-hand experience about the wartime activities of women in the Axis countries, enemy countries, France, and the Soviet Union, and publishing them as a paper symposium as follows:</p>
<p>Obligatory Labor Service</p>
<p>Q: First, we would like to start with the state of women's mobilization in various countries. Where are women being conscripted for compulsory service? Mr. Kune, what is the situation in Germany?</p>
<p>Kune: According to the General Labor Mobilization Law, all German women between the ages of seventeen and forty-five must register. This is a decree promulgated in January of this year. Before this, although women were not conscripted, they were already very diligent. It can be said that there are very few exceptions. Regardless of gender, from the age of eighteen to twenty-five, before taking a job, everyone must join the labor service team and do several months of compulsory service in the countryside. German women are quite strong physically, so they are not inferior to men in doing manual labor. No matter how wealthy the family, the daughters consider labor as an honorable thing, and the aided farmers are happy to accept the service. The image of spirited young girls wearing red headscarves and green uniforms while working forms a beautiful color in the German countryside during the busy farming season.</p>
<p>Q: After completing labor service, what kind of work are women mostly assigned to?</p>
<p>Kune: It can be said that there are very few professions where women do not cooperate. In addition to government officials and Red Cross nurses, there are also many who work as messengers and train conductors. Even the Japanese government-run railway bureau has begun to hire female ticket collectors...</p>
<p>Female Aviator Receives Highest Medal</p>
<p>Bellgar: Train conductors must undergo seven weeks of training in the company's factories. They start by teaching basic knowledge such as the mechanical structure. The wartime female auxiliaries employed by the postal service number about 90,000, including upper and lower level staff. Field postal affairs have greatly increased, and they also undertake the important task of long-distance communication technology to maintain contact with the war zone. The delivery of parcels is also handled by women.</p>
<p>Q: What kind of work is most suitable for women?</p>
<p>Bellgar: I think the management and manufacturing of precision machinery is extremely suitable for women's careful nature. In the field of aircraft manufacturing, female aviator Ms. Henna Reitsch has engaged in extremely valuable research and received the Iron Cross, the highest medal. Doing the same work as men without losing her gentle nature is the greatness of the lady.</p>
<p>Kune: After graduating from girls' school in Germany, they learn nursing. When they have their own children, if there is a minor problem or injury, they can handle it without calling a doctor. I hope that pre-marital preparation should be like this.</p>
<p>National Strength is People's Strength</p>
<p>Q: In Italy, are many women also joining various occupational sectors?</p>
<p>Gifu: According to the National General Mobilization Law promulgated last year, all women in Italy between the ages of fourteen and sixty must be mobilized. Fifty percent of Italian women work directly or indirectly in the production sector, half of whom participate in agricultural labor, munitions factories, bank and company affairs, transportation agencies, and various other fields. Eighty percent of primary school teachers are women.</p>
<p>Q: Isn't Prime Minister Mussolini's policy to keep women in the family?</p>
<p>Gifu: Prime Minister Mussolini once said, "A country's national strength lies in the number of people." Therefore, when women's labor becomes an obstacle to population policy, it is natural to find ways to eliminate this obstacle. Therefore, various facilities to protect mothers and children are implemented. On the one hand, they continuously give birth to children, but on the other hand, they also need them to work in the production sector. Italian women are very diligent in their families, especially rural women, who strive for food self-sufficiency. There is a Fascist women's organization called the "Rural Housewives Association," which sends female graduates to rural areas to teach cooking methods, etc. The reclamation of wasteland is also carried out by women's groups doing labor service.</p>
<p>French Women</p>
<p>Inoue: Like Italy, French rural women are also very diligent. People generally think that French women are very vain, gluttonous, and lazy. This is because they only see a part of the women in Paris and do not know the rural women of France, an agricultural country. Even Parisian women are actually very simple, frugal, and diligent. Since France's defeat, women's social activities have gradually become organized. The Vichy government's policy is to organize groups and turn French women in the family into French women of the country.</p>
<p>Q: So women's groups are forming the center of activities?</p>
<p>Inoue: The government has unified and merged women's groups, dividing them into girls' departments and women's departments, with women aged sixteen to twenty-five as members, and starting training. Under the slogan of homeland, labor, and family, they are made to understand the position of women in the family, and at the same time, they are adapted to the present era. Girls' school textbooks have abolished mathematics and foreign languages, focusing on cooking, sewing, and maternal education, and science is also mainly practical. They are really doing a very good job in family work. For example, they remodel clothes that their grandmothers used to wear into the latest fashions and wear them with pride.
