<p>社評</p>
<h3>貢獻於全國警政會議</h3>
<p>今天內政部召集第二屆全國警政會議於首都，各地警務幹部聚首一堂，討論今後警政的强化。我們深感警政對於保衛治安，地方自治的關係至為重要。當此會議開始之際，除敬祝順利進行，圓滿成功外，我們願以至誠貢獻一言。</p>
<p>民二十九年八月十五日前警政部曾召集第一屆全國警政會議，距今已逾三載，在這相當悠長的過程中，國家政治形勢，社會秩序動態，變化多端，就一般情形而言，政府各方面都向「求治」的一路邁進。尤其是警政木身也有着重大的轉變，警政部原係主持全國警務行政的最高機關，於三十年八月裁撤，改組為警政總署，隸屬於內政部。而將原山警政部管轄之政治警察署，劃歸軍委會調查統計部。至此，警務行政機構改隸確定，以迄於今。</p>
<p>當第一屆全國警政會議時，討論提案共有一百三十餘件，如以提案內容分類，則編制案三十件，人事案二十件，經費案十五件，治安案二十四件，訓練案二十五件，業務案十四件，其他案六件。綜觀提案性質，關於警務問題，可謂應有盡有，出席人員各以辦理警務的經騐與心得，集思廣益，共同討論，其全部決議案，無異一部警政實鑑，可以奉為圭　。而出席人員均係各地負有警政責任者，議決案携返任所，付之實施，依吾人理想，對於警政推行必有相當進步，現在已過三年了，究竟各地警政的現實與當時的決議內容，相差幾何？我們未敢妄加臆斷，盼望道次會議與出席諸君先自加以切實的反省與檢討，或許這次出席諸君中頗有上次也會與會的，尤其應該深刻的反省。我們認為唯有深刻的反省與切實的檢討，七可以討論出今後更合理的對策。有人說過，通常的會議是「會而不議，議而不決，決而不行，行而不力」，極盡病詬的能事。可是，這次警政會議的結果，我們當然盼望絕對脫此諷刺，以為今後警政一新面目。</p>
<p>警察為公務人員中最接近民間者，所以警察的任務，最易使民聞發生直接觀感，民開對於政治的信仰，從警察的服務中最能收效。其次，警察為內政的樞紐，大多數政令的推行，均賴警察傳遞民間，因此，良好的政令，必須有良好的警察執行，才可獲致良好的結果。反之，縱有良好的政令，而無良好的警察，結果成效減少。警察與政治的關係重要既如此，與民間的密切又如彼。因此，先進國家都以改良警察為推進政治的先務。如友邦日本對於警察制度向以嚴密完善著稱於世，今日政治修明，官民一體，發揮團結力量，其得力於警察行政者，自非淺鮮。這些精義，盼望全會諸君最須有深刻的認識。</p>
<p>我們曾於五月間兩度申論加强警察制度，已將所欲言者盡量陳述。環顧當前情勢，深感所言仍屬當務之急，願再鄭重提供警政會議諸君子參攷：</p>
<p>要求警察奉公建職，安心服務，要為愛民親民，不為擾民侮民。可是，這一個要求，並不能一味在精神上責以大義所能辦到。我們認為「吃飽　與」盡職」是一件事，必須給予吃飽同時責之盡職，是應該的，是可能的。如果以「吃飽」與「盡職」為二件事，不必「吃飽」而必須「盡職」，對於警察，似乎理想太高。結果很可能適得其反，成了不必「盡職」而必須」吃飽」。因此，警察待遇，必須提高，使能「吃飽」，使能維持最低限度的生活，一部分警察不免有　弊的勾當，是產生於「不堪一飽」的一念之差者，未始全無，情勢推移，遂由初之為「吃飽「而舞弊者，進而為「舞弊」而舞弊了。為澈底消減此種不良現實，尤其需要提高正當待遇。</p>
<p>因普遍提高警察待遇，隨之發生經費問題。政府即須確定警政經費，應以警政經費視為重要政費之一。據我們理想，人民對於為改善警政而增加經費負担，必較負担其他經費為樂願。至警察待遇提高以後，即須嚴定其職權，重視其地位，責成共任務。如此，學識優長，有志服務之士，也必樂於投身警界，充實警政人事。</p>
<p>警察旣與人民最爲接近，無異人民師保，而施教之範團又極廣泛，因此，警察教育必須提高。警察原以「不眠不休」為格言，尤須應付緊急變故，因此察體格必須鍛練。</p>
<p>警察施以嚴格的知識與體格訓練後，人民對之自必轉變以往的心理，發生尊重視近的情感，然後推行政令，溝通官民協力，均可收穫相當成效。</p>
<p>最後，我們竭誠期待本屆會議的提案輿決議，能與我們的建議適應，而切合實際。同時，與會諸君携回決議案後，尤須打破「決而不行，行而不力」的詬病。警政强化，政治修明，發軔於斯！</p>

<p>里斯本二十三日中央社電　據前綫消息稱：義大利戰綫之德軍，積極加强薩勒諾北部及西北部之新陣地。美第五軍似獲得增援部隊，划正政編，尚未作何種活動。蒙高茂萊所部英第八軍，雖企圖進攻那不勒斯，然德軍防守堅固，英軍前進已受阻。傳二十二日以薩勒諾要塞為中心，終於展開激戰。又英第八軍進至義大利半島中央部交通勇衝波頓薩（Potenza、刻與該市北方之德軍激戰中。總之，義南部地　戰況，現仍保持原來狀態。據德軍當局宣稱：反軸心軍若欲於該方面，展開新　戰，仍須再行補充實力，故戰局現已入於膠　狀態。</p>

<h3>整理在產第二綫</h3>
<p>友邦日本政府最近決定之國政運營大綱，對於強化國內態勢所特別採取之方策中整有整理生產第二戰綫一點，所謂整理生產第二綫，即爲整理各種外廓團體，各種統制機關及統制會社等生產第二綫部門、同時對其業務及事務、加以澈底的刷新及減縮其人員：此外。興整理生產第二綫具有密切聯擊之價格及配給制度，則求其澈底簡素化。</p>
<p>因爲生產第二綫上的各種組織、原爲因其必要而產生，隨時代之變遷而發展的，故在運用上有隨時刷新的必要，至於在價格與配給制度上，爲一掃目前之弊端，故不得不求其簡素化。</p>
<p>某於這樣一個理念，我們覺得我國生產第二錢以及配給制度，實有力求效法友邦日本之必要；所以，在日前本報社評「紗布收買以後怎樣？」一文中，我們對於棉紗布之配給，認爲在配給程序中所經過之脣序，總以愈少愈好，勿令最後受配給者、受時間上與經濟上兩重損失，而在我們假想配給程序中，復不得不遷就商統會現行組織系統，故又認爲其中聯合會一級，如能省去，則辦事更可敏捷，所以說過，「在配給制度中，批發商是多餘的，分利的，實無存在必要。」至於說到我們統制機構中的人員，有無「因人設事」？是否「人盡其才」？那是問題的另一部份，姑不討論。</p>
<p>總而言之，我們這樣一個主張、恰正是要求統制機構刷新化，配給制度簡素化。</p>

<h3>廣田情報部長談　美侵略東亞　並闡述美侵菲經過</h3>
<p>中央社訉　日陸海外在滬常局聯合舉行報道常會，昨(二十三）日下午三時仍假匯中飯店五樓舉行，大使館上海事務所廣田情報部長，借同福問副領事出席，　隊報道部鹽田中尉出席，席間由　田情報部長發表美國對違東侵略之謀略，更對羅斯福叔姪兩代侵略菲列實之政策、聞述落詳，茲分誌如次：</p>
<p>侵略東亞</p>
<p>廣田部長首謂「美總統羅斯福最近在議會席上以敎授之方式，在議院演講，內容之空泛無足視重，按其內容所述，足以暴靈羅斯福之曾行、代表美國對東亞侵略之前鋒、即　之叔齊奧獨拉羅斯福，亦係阜年代表美國侵略東亞者，以是羅氏叔娃兩人，在美實爲一對兩代之活寶，在渠侵略東亞前錄之觀點上以觀·實爲　略匪律賓政策之實行者。」廣田氏繼謂：「緬旬已於八月一日實告獨立，非律賓在不久亦將究告正式獨立，氏又謂菲律　於一八九八年至一八九九年問、美興四班牙實戰，結果美勝攫奪非律賓領土，常時美之勝利原因、實由於美對非律賓之奸詐，佯允非得獨立、詎於事後，竟遠背約束，然至一九三四年時、美政府又通過非獨立之法案，惟須待一九四五年後始得完全獨立，蓋美殊不願非之得以獨立，故所謂一九四五處者，屆時又有可能性濃厚之延期。</p>
<p>兩代陰謀</p>
<p>廣田氏又謂：然笑國侵略東亞，根據歷史證明，當以非爲啓其端，是在美之侵略東亞政策上，此兩代之羅斯福，均爲串通侵非之主要人物，前美國內全張擴大論者，其所主張之處，以美自建國以來，其實力限於十三州，主張發展至太平洋沿岸、待至美西戰後，美乃佔領非全境，奠具一束亞之根據地、惟國內贊成者雖有、而反對者亦頗多、相互對峙，結果爲此廣大主張論者所勝、但美佔領菲鳥成功之原因，亦即對侵略古巴島之野心獲得成就，以是齊奧獨拉羅斯福之陰謀、遂爲其所實現，再以此次世界戰爭而觀，引起此次大戰之導火綫罪魁，即爲謀制霸世界，羅斯麒爲達到遠束之慾望起見，不惜在幕後作祟，掀動中日兩國衝突，且更對日本施以經濟麼迫，故佛開克令羅斯福實爲傳統的美優略東亞政策之繼承人，所用手段，與共叔同一步驟。</p>
<p>擅獨措置</p>
<p>再觀美西作戰前之陰謀，當其時泊於古巴島之美艦美鷹號爆沉，齊奧獨拉羅斯福大事利用，將該事企圖擴大，在與西班牙官戰前二月，羅即密需駐香港之美東亞艦隊司令官紐維，訓令美西一旦開戰時，着即開調非律濱，向泊馬尼拉海之西班牙艦隊·出其不意·向之轟擊，是時羅尚爲海軍次官資格，竟擅獨下此命令，今之羅斯福之行爲，與其叔有異曲同工之妙，蓋火束亞戰爭發生前，羅對臼德義三國，以經濟問題作種種之壓迫，此事在座諸君巳明白瞭解，在爆發前三月，即前年九月上旬，羅令美艦隊在海上如遇德潛水艇時，即予以襲擊，故是項聲明，足資證明此兩代羅斯福完全爲戰爭之挑撥者、更可謂戰爭之製　者。</p>
<p>詭計多謀</p>
<p>再羅叔對飛之態度，當一八九八年四月廿四日美西作戰時，泊港之美東亞盤隊，由紐維奉命開赴馬尼拉灣，於五月一日將班牙艦隊擊滅，然美則無陸軍　　，美即與菲獨立運動者阿利那特軍成立諒解，美終獲此援助，平定菲全土治安，佯允非於是年五月廿四日予以獨立，至六月又選舉阿為總統，此次　叔見計得售，未幾羅忽調解，派國內陸軍一萬人赴菲，佔領馬尼拉，即控制阿利那特之獨立軍隊、且設計滅亡，此種手段，乃為羅叔之謀略利已手段，而如今之佛蘭克令羅斯福之行爲、與其叔如出一轍、再如羅叔之約束非之獨立，全爲美經濟原理上之企劃，蓋非爲農業國家、大量田口運往美國，而非農產物多而賤，兩國利益相反·以白糖一項而言·故美放棄非糖輸美，一部份權作關稅、以利已農產利益，此外對菲限制移民，再以大東亞戰前、佛蘭克令羅斯福着執政官麥克諾塞將軍赴菲，計劃建設非陸軍，予以擴大加强，一面干涉非之內政外交，一簡設立軍事棋據地，是項情形·與美前佔古巴島設施無異，美之　非給與獨立、祗有名而無實，故兩代羅斯福之詭計，乃係東亞之侵略者及挑戰者。</p>
<h3>軍配組運到　大宗雜糧　交固本公司平售</h3>
<p>最近軍配組爲補助民食不足，曾向各地採辦大宗雜糧來滬應銷，茲聞　又巡抵菉豆千餘包、蠶豆及白缸豆數千包，刻已交予固本雜糧公司、以平價出售。</p>
<h3>儲蓄週定期存款　改期開獎　日期十月二日</h3>
<p>中央儲蓄銀行主辦之儲落週，已於本月廿二日終了，該行業經分函銀行公會，曁其他參加單位，限期本月廿三日將該週內所收有獎定期存款總額，已用及未用，掐獎號碼等，詳列清單報齊，以憑辦理開獎手續，聞該行原定本月底開獎，嗣因與中央　蓋會特儲券開獎日期衡突，乃改定於十月二日開獎云。</p>
<h3>各廠製成麵粉　達二百萬包</h3>
<p>華中各地區小麥首期妝買，方策完成後，各製粉廠均已相繼復工，茲聞本市各粉廠開工迄今，已製就　粉不下二百萬包強，其中一部已供給當地民需外，運往華北充作物資交換者共右百餘萬包，故目下申存約五十萬包左右，又據記者探悉，本市待種粉之　給，仍由原機團辦理，一八兩區為暫察分署，市區爲日商小麥粉配給組云。</p>
<h3>華服趨勢</h3>
<p>昨華設市陷在急遽向高峯挺進中，各方人心沸騰，在求方優勢下，上午各股一味步升不囘，新樂業百貨業實業股尤受投資者之靑睞，其他各種頭寸較寬，交易鼎盛，至下午局勢穩中略同，係一般無力者之同吐，前途似有步展之望，今分誌谷　股於後。</p>
<p>百貨—永安公司二次增資後，新股做開，晨初迄午竟連升兩級，最高價於下午出現，但即稍囘下，終以兩股半新股合價比上日一老股軋升甚巨，新新公司曾飛升叩關，後稍囘小，與國貨公司軋升半級以上，中國內衣挺升亦動一突出級外，仍在步升中。</p>
<p>紡織—永安紡織農開後竟步升一級半·下午在盤旋中，仍軋升一關以上。大生一廠略挺，三廠仍平，中紡信和美亞上升最速，達豐染織與防勤慶豐榮豐紡織漲度較差，小票面宏甡五和鴻興大中華織造等股亦微有進　，景福衫襪進抬更烈，高達票面兩倍，景綸衫襪亦挺升一成。</p>
<p>新藥—新亞藥廠上升量速，關外做開，中法藥房再漲，中途多盤，五洲中西兩藥房各越級外，中英明星香水抬上不少，新星藥廠求多少供，亦超越票面倍餘。</p>
<p>金融、大陸上海浙興鹽業均在買勢中再創新高價，金城與中一價託較平。</p>
<p>文化—商務中華世界三警局買風亦起，各升至關外，軋升不少，永祥印書亦爲進戶喊高。</p>

<h3>商情摘要</h3>
<p>公債　昨價曾幾度興奮，終仍下降，與股票行市背道而馳，顯係賣出公債，收囘股票，昨初做丙種再升後，中途小同，十一時許突又上竄甚巨，至中午最後價，與隔日相一等，甲乙兩種均較小，丫種獨好，戊種亦小，趨勢跌多漲少。</p>
<p>拆息　錢業公會拆息一角八分未更。</p>

<p>茶葉　農開接乘上日疲風，兼以實銷去化迄少生色。故趨勢總平，迨至午市，聞本街店莊對於低莊綠茶之銷轉活，人心亦趨挺俏，交易雖仍凋零，惟行情已見堅挺，全市由本街店戶添進綠茶十三扣，同時成交紅茶二十二箱·聞榮昌協豐兩茶行所售出。</p>

<h3>巴陀里奧投隆後　德國戰意愈决</h3>
<p>三國同盟的叛逆者巴陀里奧的倒戈，對世界戰局有何影響？在東部和敵人交戰而希望必勝的德國，對今後的戰局將如何應付？每日新聞社柏林分社長佐藤用國際電聒向東京報告如次：</p>
<p>第日親聞社：</p>
<p>德國把巴陸軍奧政府的投降作何看法？</p>
<p>加藤：據本日德國外交部當局發表，巴陀里奧的背叛、乃是有計劃的犯罪行爲。他的罪行·即爲對以墨索里尼氏爲中心的法西斯政權，以至於對義大利人民之眞正的代表者，作最惡毒的叛逆行爲。自從墨索里尼氏悲劇式的下整以後，德國早已料到有今日，故一點也不表慌張動搖。政府所發表的公報，德國人民處之泰然。</p>
<p>本社：在日本也同樣的平靜·這想是日德同被必勝的信念所實澈的緣故。在北義建立的所謂法西斯新政府如何。</p>
<p>加藤：那先前已經發表。德國人民聽到代表義國人民眞意的法西斯黨毅然蹶起、協力完途對英美戰爭的消息，非常愉快，意氣爲之大壯，衷心拍手聲援。今日除新政府業已建立之外，關於其組織，機構　　　未明　陳、遷政府用何種形式協力擊減英美，支柱政府的軍隊之構成等，也物尚未淸楚。政府所在地似在德義國境附近的義大利北部一小都會。</p>
<p>駐義德軍作戰方策</p>
<p>本社：在義德軍的今後的作戰如何？</p>
<p>加藤：敵軍今後將在義大利各地陸續登陸。但德軍的擊減登陸敵軍的作戰方針，始終並無變更。讓敵軍在各地登陸·並非舉棋不定，無法應付之謂，乃根據旣定方針進行作戰，即誘引敵軍至北方，然後一舉加以殲減。又德軍在南部曾和義軍發生小衝突、現在或許尚有繼起、但那在作戰大局上、並無任何影響。</p>
<p>本社·東部戰錢和巴爾幹方面的義軍如何。</p>
<p>加藤：現在東部戰綫的義軍已移至後方。其數量亦不致於成爲問題。</p>
<p>本社：在義日本人的情形如何？</p>
<p>加藤：柏林、羅馬之間的聯絡·已告切斷，故一切均不明暸。要之，我們看來、昂揚像　在這樣三國同盟的精神，鞏固團結的時期，已經同去、日本和德國及，今後更生的法西斯新政府，三位併感眞正的一體，用必勝信念向擊減英美邁　—那是最緊要的。德國一般人也這樣想着。</p>
<p>本社：本月十日希特勒的演說，國民的士氣對之如何？</p>
<p>加藤：柏林市民對之均甚激動。十一日的德國晨報，當然盛爲報道。那演說的要旨：第一，義大利的脫離，所及於德國全體戰局上的影響，極爲微小。第二，這演說中，充分表現了希特勒對墨索里尼的友誼。第三、對巴陀里奧的無信、用竣烈的憤怒聲調，呼起民衆的共感，而與以絕大的鼓勵</p>
<p>德國人民戰意昂揚</p>
<p>德國人對這演說的印象，迄今爲止、和是敵是友不分明的累贅的義軍一同作戰，現在這重荷業已解除，此後得用其全部精力，以白己意志對英美作戰，今日以前的不明期空氣，一掃而空。把這民眾的精神作後台，依總統大本營發表，依預定計劃，積極進行義大利背叛的普後策。白羅馬以次的計多戰略要地，陸續落入德軍手中·義軍的解除武裝，亦順利進行。故德國民眾非常欣喜。</p>
<p>本社：德軍的佈置如何？</p>
<p>加藤：從德依名將羅美爾凱塞林駢　在義國佈優一事看來，德國的決心，即可瞭然。今日以前、德國隨時須得負上海上運輸的重荷，與英美軍相持、現在形勢一變·不能不在海上運輸的是他們、而德國則可開始最得意的陸上戰爭，和英美交手。此次將使他們嘗到德國的實力，對他們予以迎頭痛擊。到在積極進行的善後策，即其明證。邱吉爾和羅斯福發表共同聲明·呼籲義國民眾「信賴英美和德國交戰」、於是乃有義軍投降的事發生。但以公平的目光來看，戰況對德國右利。義軍之中，有勇氣老和德國協力，走向敵方的都是怯懦的軍隊，所以邱吉爾和羅斯福得到此種軍隊、在對德國戰爭上毫無用處。目前的形勢、南部義大利英美業已右相當兵力登陸，在北部，德軍據險頑抗，義大利分爲二部，有變成大戰塲的可能性</p>
<p>本社：巴陀里奧政權以後怎樣？</p>
<p>加藤：巴陀里奧早巳逃出羅馬，到何處去還沒有知進，大概在南部義大刹或西西里島吧！背叛政權似乎已經變成亡命政權，巴陀里奧政權內的幹部，以後怎樣，也不淸楚。</p>
<p>本社：在北義誕生的法四斯政權，此後的活躍如何？</p>
<p>北義新政府的動態</p>
<p>加藤：大爲活動，一二日內政府的人還即將發表。聽說以前法四斯黨書記長法列那齊，前文化宣傳部長伯伏利尼，墨氏公子維多利亞，　索里尼三人爲領袖。名義上仍用墨氏的形式。</p>
<p>本社：大利的海軍呢？</p>
<p>加藤：英國方面的情報說義大利海軍的一部業已逃至馬爾泰島。當然在托倫吐的一部已經逃出，在斯佩齊亞的一部亦已　走。所以的確已有若干逃至馬爾泰及直布緬陀。但德國的手段亦很高明，有的在逃走之前扣住，有的因逃避而擊沉，所以敵方所得到者沒有那麼多，</p>
<p>義艦投降頗堪重視</p>
<p>但我們不能忘記，在義大利本土，英　業已登陸，地中海的制海權，亦已有多少加强，義允利艦隊的一部，爲獲，因此、敵方的通過地中海，較可自由，而他們所加於印度洋的壓力。也將加强。從日本的見地，不能看過這事實。（翔：譯自九月十一日，十三日東京每日新聞）</p>

<h3>所望於收買棉　紗布之後</h3>
<p>— 水兆熊</p>
<p>收買棉紗布，猶如晴大霹震，其影響後果，實深且鉅。就其壓平物價一點而言，叨在小民，莫不感奮！惟是政策之實施，尚須求其全面性而澈底化，然後效果普遍，利及衆生。筆者服務棉織廠業公曾，思從維護同業生產事業一點，略述收買後之希望焉！</p>
<p>我國棉織工廠，尚屬幼稚時代，資本類皆弱小，設備尤多簡陋，工廠多爲弄堂工廠，會無異於界堂小學，伏處各弄，遍佈全市，蓋小而多之廠商也。惟市民賴以工作生活者，直接間接，不下百餘萬，此外因加工漂染整理，皆另由他廠代理，則是與本業右關者，又何啻萬千！平日廠內機器工人，已充塞無間隙，更何有存　原料之餘地。自紗綫及原坯禁止移動以來，廠內存料，早已告罄，外棧所存，雖在規定保留額內，惟緩不濟急，亦徒望機興嘆而已！迄今陸續停工者日增，工人賴以生活者，無以爲依。若長此以往，其於民生前途，誠堪區慮！</p>
<p>然則何以處理之，日：易也。棉紗布若被不法國積，誠足以危害國本；政府收買用之於正當生產及交換糧食，祗須管理及運用得法，自不難恢復生產於俄頃，救人民於水火也。其法維何？第一，收買與配給應求其迅速，遲緩則難免工廠夭折；第二，配給務求其條理井然，紛歧則難收實效</p>
<p>何開收買與配給，應求其迅速？蓋工廠原料旣已申請出賣，多數且存在外棧，即保留量內之原料亦無法移動；故停工者日必增加，工人失業，職工閑職，使工廠愈難維持。如今配配給一綫之望未絕，工廠成半開之廠，職工成半閑之狀，工人日日探聽開工消息，其遊離散佚之狀，莫可名狀。故吾人亟盼收買早日竣事，配給早日實施，以挽可慮之局。抑尤有進者，外棧存料如在正當情形之下，應許工廠移動以維生產，亦爲急不容緩之圖，</p>
<p>何謂配給務求其條理井然？棉紗布之收買，旣備長期戰時之用，故配給之時必須條理井然，始便於管理而免糜費；尤須切合實際狀況，加以調劑補教，以輔生產之不足，免致勞工生計蒙受影響。茲試分述配給初步方案於下，以期當局　議辦法之時，咯作參考：</p>
<p>甲、配給原料之製品應規定式樣。配給旣備長時期應用，則人民消費自宜加以限制、製品花色繁多，消耗原料亦多、節省消耗，首求製品簡單；故宜規定日用必需品，式樣數種，以便釗一製造、</p>
<p>乙·規定工廠及批發零售商適當潤利，利潤規定適當，售價勢必合理；市上存貨，因新貨不斷生產，價格適當，則其原右售價，自不壓而平。</p>
<p>丙·工廠應合「連」生產以便配給。棉織廠大小不一；組織亙異，舉一干餘家而配給之，自難收統制之效；若能十家合爲一「連」，千家僅百「述」矣；舉百「連」以爲配給，則事半而功倍。</p>
<p>丁·工人登記，輸班上工，並應增加工資。全市勞工人數旣眾，同屬生產之輩，皆爲國家命脈所寄，若任命流離失所，豈國家之幸？再者配給原料又須繼續長期維持，不宜隨便一予取予求」。仿之工廠合「連」，則工人亦應登記合「連」，分班上工，增加工資以維生計，則國力仍可保樹；且原料價格旣低，增加工資，絕不致影響出品售價。</p>
<p>戊、承放工廠貸款，調制工廠資金。工廠為圍家元氣所在，其存料旣被收買之後，資本呆疲，必須鑒其實需，承放工廠貸款，予以維護，則復興可期。</p>
<p>上述種種，或巳在常局熱思籌感中，自無庸民間過慮「惟此事所關於我國棉織廠業者至大，故企望之殷，如大旱之望雲兒。想　明當局定措置安善，以符吾人之厚望焉！</p>

        <h1>1943.09.24</h1>
<h3>Contributions to the National Police Administration Conference</h3>
<p>Today, the Ministry of the Interior convened the second National Police Administration Conference in the capital, where police executives from across the country gathered to discuss strengthening police administration in the future. We deeply feel that police administration is extremely important for safeguarding public order and local autonomy. As this conference begins, in addition to sincerely wishing it a smooth process and complete success, we would like to offer a word of sincere contribution.</p>
<p>The Police Administration Department convened the first National Police Administration Conference before August 15, 1940, more than three years ago. During this considerably long process, the national political situation and social order dynamics have undergone various changes. Generally speaking, all aspects of the government are advancing towards a path of "seeking order." In particular, the police administration itself has also undergone significant changes. The Police Administration Department was originally the highest authority in charge of national police affairs administration, but it was abolished in August 1941 and reorganized into the Police Administration Headquarters, under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of the Interior. The political police department, originally under the jurisdiction of the Police Administration Department, was transferred to the Investigation and Statistics Department of the Military Affairs Commission. Since then, the reorganization of the police administration agency has been finalized and remains in effect to this day.</p>
<p>At the first National Police Administration Conference, more than 130 proposals were discussed. Classified by proposal content, there were 30 organizational proposals, 20 personnel proposals, 15 funding proposals, 24 public security proposals, 25 training proposals, 14 business proposals, and 6 other proposals. Looking at the nature of the proposals, it can be said that they covered all aspects of police affairs. Attendees shared their experience and insights in handling police affairs, brainstorming and discussing together. All the resolutions passed were no different from a police administration manual, which could be regarded as a model. The attendees were all responsible for police administration in various regions, and they took the resolutions back to their posts and implemented them. According to our ideal, this would surely lead to considerable progress in police administration. Now that three years have passed, what is the gap between the reality of police administration in various regions and the content of the resolutions at that time? We dare not make reckless assumptions, but we hope that the participants of this conference will first conduct a practical reflection and review themselves. Perhaps some of the participants in this conference also attended the previous conference, and they should especially reflect deeply. We believe that only with deep reflection and practical review can we discuss more reasonable countermeasures for the future. Someone once said that the usual meeting is "meeting without discussing, discussing without deciding, deciding without acting, acting without effort," which is the utmost in criticizing its ills. However, we certainly hope that the outcome of this police administration conference will absolutely break away from this irony, so as to give police administration a new look in the future.</p>
<p>Police are the public officials closest to the people, so the tasks of the police are most likely to cause direct impressions on the people. The people's belief in politics can be most effectively gained from the service of the police. Secondly, the police are the hub of internal affairs. The implementation of most government orders relies on the police to transmit them to the people. Therefore, good government orders must be executed by good police to achieve good results. Conversely, even with good government orders, without good police, the results will be diminished. The relationship between police and politics is so important, and the closeness to the people is also like that. Therefore, advanced countries all take improving the police as the first priority in promoting politics. For example, friendly country Japan is renowned in the world for its strict and perfect police system. Today, with enlightened politics, officials and the people are united, exerting a unified strength, and its success is attributed to police administration, which is certainly not insignificant. We hope that all members of the conference will have a deep understanding of these essential meanings.</p>
<p>We have twice discussed strengthening the police system in May, and we have stated as much as possible what we wanted to say. Looking at the current situation, we deeply feel that what we said is still a matter of urgency, and we would like to solemnly provide it to the gentlemen of the Police Administration Conference for reference:</p>
<p>We require the police to be devoted to their duties and secure in their service, to love and be close to the people, and not to harass or insult the people. However, this requirement cannot be achieved solely by imposing great righteousness on them in spirit. We believe that "eating one's fill and fulfilling one's duties" are one and the same. It is necessary to provide them with enough to eat while holding them accountable for fulfilling their duties. This is appropriate and possible. If "eating one's fill" and "fulfilling one's duties" are regarded as two separate matters, and it is not necessary to "eat one's fill" but necessary to "fulfill one's duties," it seems that the ideal is too high for the police. The result is very likely to be the opposite, becoming not necessary to "fulfill one's duties" but necessary to "eat one's fill." Therefore, police compensation must be increased so that they can "eat their fill" and maintain a minimum standard of living. It is not entirely without reason that some police officers inevitably engage in corrupt activities, which stems from a single thought of "not being able to eat their fill." As the situation changes, it gradually evolves from initially "eating their fill" through corruption to "corruption" for the sake of corruption. To completely eliminate this undesirable reality, it is especially necessary to increase legitimate compensation.</p>
<p>Increasing police compensation universally inevitably leads to the issue of funding. The government must determine that police administration funding should be regarded as one of the important government expenses. According to our ideal, the people will be more willing to bear the burden of increased funding for improving police administration than to bear the burden of other expenses. After police compensation is increased, it is necessary to strictly define their powers, value their position, and hold them accountable for their tasks. In this way, those who are knowledgeable, have excellent skills, and are willing to serve will also be happy to join the police force and enrich police administration personnel.</p>
<p>Since the police are the closest to the people, no different from the people's teachers and protectors, and the scope of education is extremely broad, police education must be improved. The police originally take "sleeplessness and tireless work" as their motto, and they must especially be able to cope with emergencies, so police physique must be trained.</p>
<p>After the police receive rigorous knowledge and physical training, the people will naturally change their past perception of them, and feelings of respect and closeness will arise. Then, promoting government orders and communicating official-civilian cooperation can achieve considerable results.</p>
<p>Finally, we sincerely expect that the proposals and resolutions of this conference can be adapted to our suggestions and in line with reality. At the same time, after the attendees bring back the resolutions, they must break the criticism of "deciding without acting, acting without effort." Strengthening police administration and improving politics begin here!</p>

He left Japan on the 23rd and returned to the capital.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Chairman Wang, concurrently the President of the Executive Yuan, visited Japan on September 21st and returned to the capital at 4:30 PM on the 23rd.

The Chairman, dressed in full ceremonial attire and looking radiant, shook hands with each of the greeters after disembarking, and then took a special car back to his official residence. It is also learned that Zhou Jiangxiang, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, also accompanied the Chairman on this trip to Japan.</p>
<p>Statement Released</p>
<p>Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Chairman Wang, concurrently the President of the Executive Yuan, visited Japan on September 21st with Legislative Yuan President Chen Gongbo and held discussions with friendly government authorities. Upon returning to the capital on September 23rd, he issued the following statement:</p>
<p>"On this trip to Japan, I had the honor of paying respects to His Majesty the Emperor and listening to his profound insights, and I was deeply honored and moved by the preferential treatment I received. His Majesty's earnest concern for the improvement of Sino-Japanese relations has further inspired me to strive harder, and I hope that all compatriots across the country will work together towards the path of revitalizing China and defending East Asia. Strive forward.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I had earnest discussions with Prime Minister Tojo and Ministers Shigemitsu, Aoki, and Shimada for a considerable amount of time. I deeply expressed my gratitude for their good intentions regarding the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights, as well as for their various assistance in suppressing commodity prices and stabilizing people's livelihoods. Furthermore, we discussed various issues of the current situation, and I received the Prime Minister's candid remarks. He expounded on the foundations for the Axis powers, especially the inevitable victory of the Greater East Asia War, and provided clear and precise instructions. In addition to my admiration, I felt that the bright future is increasingly expanding.</p>
<p>Although this trip to Japan was short, what I saw and heard confirmed that the unwavering belief in the inevitable victory of our friendly nations is firmly rooted in everyone's hearts. The operation of government affairs and the increase in production all prove that this belief has a deep and solid foundation. What is particularly gratifying is that since the Greater East Asia War, the people of our friendly nations have regained their Asian consciousness and are striving for the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. This spirit is in perfect harmony with the Greater Asianism advocated by our Founding Father. All our comrades should have a deep understanding and enthusiastic empathy for this point.</p>
<p>During this visit, I had earnest discussions with government authorities of our friendly nations on various issues, and I learned that Japan's attitude towards China is extremely fair and kind, and they sincerely hope for China's independence and prosperity. To achieve this hope, they are willing to provide full assistance. I sincerely hope that government colleagues and the people of the whole country understand the truth of the current situation. For the sake of defending East Asia, the peoples of East Asia should not be constantly hostile to each other. For the sake of revitalizing China, a comprehensive peace should be achieved as soon as possible. We must ensure that the whole country works together with one heart and mind, so that unification and construction can be completed, and the remaining poison left by Britain and the United States in China can be swept away, and the traces of unequal treaties can be permanently eliminated. Only in this way can we live up to the Founding Father's dying wishes, and the spirit of "the world is for all" will ultimately become the foundation for revitalizing China and defending East Asia."</p>
<p>Significant Meaning</p>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Local political figures have stated that the significance of President Wang's visit to Japan is that the Japanese government previously implemented a new policy towards China in September, with the aim of assisting China in achieving autonomy and independence, strengthening the cooperation between the two nations based on the spirit of morality. In addition to transferring concessions and abolishing extraterritorial rights, it continues to transfer enemy properties. At the same time, other rights and interests in China are also being adopted by various countries in the same manner as Japan, cooperating with each other. Therefore, China has been able to fulfill its long-cherished wish of a century, break away from the shackles of unequal treaties, gain liberation, and establish a foundation for independent and complete self-governance. Furthermore, the political power of the National Government has recently been strengthened. Now, President Wang's second visit to Japan, where he frankly exchanged views with Prime Minister Tojo and key Japanese government figures on strengthening Sino-Japanese cooperation, is of extremely significant importance. Regarding the Sino-Japanese countries dealing with the current war situation and strengthening various connections between the two countries, opinions have been completely unified. Therefore, the cooperation between China and Japan will inevitably be further strengthened, which will make a great contribution to the final victory of the Greater East Asia War. At the same time, Chairman Wang's visit to Japan has particularly demonstrated the solid spirit of unity in Greater East Asia.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency) - The Rice Grain Control Committee is about to be established.

At the same time, the Chinese side will also directly purchase, but the control agency will be undertaken by the Japanese Rice Grain Purchasing Association. The inland area or the area close to the enemy area is designated as Area B. The Chinese side is responsible for purchasing rice grains in this area.

<h3>Italian War Situation is in a Stalemate, British Forces in the Central Region Have Encountered Obstacles in Their Advance</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency) - According to frontline reports, the German army on the Italian front is actively strengthening its new positions north and northwest of Salerno. The US Fifth Army seems to have received reinforcements and is reorganizing, but has not yet taken any action. Although the British Eighth Army, under the command of Montgomery, attempted to attack Naples, the German defenses are strong, and the British advance has been obstructed. It is reported that fierce fighting finally broke out on the 22nd, centered on the Salerno fortress. Furthermore, the British Eighth Army advanced to Potenza, a key transportation point in the central part of the Italian peninsula, and is currently engaged in fierce fighting with the German army north of the city. In short, the war situation in southern Italy is currently maintaining its original state. According to the German authorities, if the anti-Axis forces want to launch a new battle on that front, they still need to replenish their strength, so the war situation has now entered a stalemate.</p>
<p>Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency) - Military dispatch from the Haitian News Agency: The British and American forces in southern Italy have not taken any further offensive, but are still limited to reconnaissance movements, and are entering the area retreated by the German army with caution. The German army has retreated to a new defense line, so the battles are only limited to local nature. The center of the German army's new position is northwest and north of Salerno, and the situation is completely unchanged. The German army continues to strengthen its position and successfully repel the advances of the Allied forces. The area of Bari has also been evacuated according to the original plan. Although the advance of the US Fifth Army has received a large amount of regular reinforcements, it is still extremely cautious. General Clark's purpose is clearly to concentrate his artillery before making another large-scale offensive, and he still feels the need to advance in areas where the range of naval artillery has not been established. The advance of the Eighth Army has also slowed down, and the German army's terrain positions and ingenious rearguard tactics have all prevented the rapid advance of the British vanguard, so Montgomery's troops are still stranded on the line of Muro, Potenza, and Agnone. At the same time, the Anti-Axis forces landed on Sardinia, and the German army had already evacuated from there the previous day. The landing force should be the US army, but it has not been determined at this time whether this US army is the vanguard of the US Tenth Army, because this army has not been seen since the Battle of Sicily. However, the fact that the Anti-Axis forces have occupied Sardinia makes their attack on Corsica inevitable, so the Anti-Axis forces have been conducting exploratory landings in Corsica with weak forces. However, it is not easy to gain a foothold on the rocky coast. The great battle has not yet begun, and the main positions are still in Corsica, and there is not a large amount of guerrilla activity as reported externally.</p>
<h3>Rumors that Marshall Will Be Appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Anti-Axis Forces</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency) - There is considerable confusion in the British and American military camps. Rumors are circulating that US Army Chief of Staff General Marshall will be dismissed from his post. United Press International previously reported that Marshall had been appointed Commander-in-Chief of the British and American Army, Navy, and Air Force, but said that this appointment had not been officially confirmed. London sources say that Prime Minister Churchill refused to comment in the House of Commons on Washington's rumors that General Marshall had been appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Anti-Axis forces. Later, Washington sources said that a formal announcement could be made today.</p>

<h3>German Troops Withdraw from Two Important Cities on the Eastern Front: Poltava and Chernihiv</h3>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) – The German News Agency, quoting a war communiqué issued by the Führer's Headquarters on the 23rd, stated: "Although the enemy on the Eastern Front has launched fierce offensives, German troops are still able to conduct their disengagement maneuvers according to plan, particularly in the central sector. The enemy continues to intensify its attacks. German troops have now commenced a planned withdrawal from Poltava (southwest of Kharkiv), after demolishing all military-related installations before withdrawing." Between Eastern Cherkassy and Chernihiv, on the middle reaches of the Dnieper River, the enemy is pursuing our troops but inevitably suffers attacks from our forces. Fierce fighting continues. In the areas southwest of Gomel and around Smolensk, all enemy attempts to break through have been thwarted.</p>

<p>Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) – With the autumn mud season approaching, Soviet forces are continuing to amass large forces along the Smolensk-Dyatkovo, Poltava, and northern Crimea lines, attempting to break through the German central positions. German forces are implementing planned evasive maneuvers. Three months after the Soviet offensive began, they have repeatedly suffered heavy losses and have failed to encircle and annihilate German forces in any single location. A summary of war reports from the German front lines on the 22nd is as follows: Smolensk Front: After concentrating substantial forces, Soviet troops are attempting to penetrate the German rear from both the north and south of the city, aiming to completely encircle it. However, these attempts have been repeatedly repulsed by vigorous German counterattacks, so the battle remains unchanged. Roslavl Area: Soviet pressure is visibly intensifying, but their advance has been checked by resilient German defenses. Dyatkovo Front: Soviet troops west of Bryansk have not launched an offensive for two days, consolidating their forces. On the 21st, they began a general offensive towards Gomel, a key point in Belarus, deploying a large mobile force along the Bryansk-Gomel railway. Additionally, Soviet troops who captured Chernihiv are now advancing towards the middle reaches of the Dnieper River, but are making no progress due to fierce German counterattacks. Kyiv Eastern Front: The situation in the Niezhin and Pryluky areas remains unchanged. However, Soviet troops have launched a pincer attack from the north and south in an attempt to recapture Poltava, and German forces are fiercely resisting. Melitopol Front: The situation around Chaplynka and Melitopol is currently quiet, but Soviet troops are massing in the Azov region, preparing to advance through the steppes between the lower Dnieper and Crimea.</p>

<p>South Pacific Base (Central News Agency) – On the dawn of the 23rd, Japanese naval air units attacked enemy positions at Buna in New Guinea.

<h3>Three-Nation Foreign Ministers' Meeting to Be Held in the Soviet Union; Post-War Issues to Be Discussed</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency) – According to London sources, British Foreign Secretary Eden announced to the House of Commons that the British and Soviet governments had decided not to conclude any post-war agreement with European anti-Axis countries in the near future.

<p>Amsterdam, 23rd (Central News Agency) – According to a London dispatch, British Foreign Secretary Eden met with Czech exile government leader Beneš on Wednesday to discuss matters before visiting Moscow. When Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov visited Britain last year, he signed an agreement with Britain and other British allies and discussed post-war issues. At that time, the British government believed that it was best not to establish any agreement between Britain and the Soviet Union for the time being, so Beneš postponed his visit to Moscow. Eden said that he personally hoped to discuss the issue with Molotov and representatives from the United States and the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>British-Spanish Relations: Eden Answers Questions from Parliament</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency) – According to a London dispatch, during yesterday's session of the British House of Commons, a member raised questions regarding the Spanish Blue Division on the Eastern Front and the port of Tangier. Foreign Secretary Eden replied that the Spanish government held a discriminatory attitude toward British interests, so Ambassador Hoare met with General Franco before returning home to call the country's attention. Our ambassador has stated regarding the Spanish Blue Division on the Eastern Front that if the division engages in combat on the Eastern Front, it will hinder friendly relations between Britain and Spain. Furthermore, the member questioned whether German submarines were using Spanish ports. Eden replied that the Spanish government had agreed with our government to investigate the truth. Finally, Eden declared that the British government had protested to Spain regarding German activities in the Tangier international zone.</p>
<h3>Britain Invites Representatives from All Sectors to a Secret Meeting</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 23rd (Central News Agency) – Allied victories in the recent Mediterranean campaign have led to optimistic fantasies regarding the future of the world war. In Britain, there has been much discussion, and it is reported that strikes are very common in various industries, especially aircraft manufacturing factories. In response, British officials convened a secret meeting of representatives from all sectors in London on the 22nd. Attending were Minister of Aircraft Production Cripps and representatives from related departments, labor representatives, and representatives from various industries, discussing the issue of boosting war production.

<h3>British Aircraft Raid Germany, 21 Shot Down</h3>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) – The Führer's Headquarters specially announced that British air forces attacked several locations in northwestern Germany last night. Residents and houses in Hanover and Oldenburg suffered significant damage. According to current information, 21 enemy aircraft were shot down.</p>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) – Today, local officials said: "For several weeks, enemy aircraft have only made threatening flights over German territory. However, on Tuesday evening, British aircraft resumed attacks on German cities. While enemy aircraft were still flying over the ocean, German fighters took off and pursued them fiercely. The remaining enemy aircraft dropped bombs on residential areas in cities in northwestern Germany. Because they could not aim accurately, some of the bombs were dropped on open ground. Germany's newly implemented air defense strategy has severely damaged the enemy. German fighter squadrons and anti-aircraft artillery divisions and searchlights are working closely together, so many enemy heavy bombers have been shot down."</p>
<h3>Britain Plans to Convene a Conference of Dominions in Early Spring; Churchill's Statement in the House of Commons</h3>
<p>Amsterdam, 23rd (Central News Agency) – Prime Minister Churchill declared in the House of Commons on Tuesday: "I hope to convene a conference of prime ministers from across the British Empire in early spring." This conference will be extremely important.</p>
<p>A Japanese Authority Comments on Churchill's Speech</p>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) – A certain authority in this city commented on Churchill's speech in Parliament, saying: "Although Britain and the United States have invaded the Axis countries with careful planning, they have ultimately suffered significant sacrifices and are trapped in a protracted war. Churchill's speech was to report to the British people that the plan to seize Rome has been completed and is being carried out by Allied troops, fully revealing Britain's cunning tactics. Today, the US military bears the greatest responsibility on the European front. The US Congress's criticism of Britain that the British military has contributed too little to the war is not without reason. Roosevelt and other American war leaders are being used by Britain, which is also pitiful. Churchill has frankly admitted the fact that Mussolini was rescued. However, what is most surprising is that Churchill publicly announced the plan to assassinate Mussolini. This may be what they often call 'civilization.' Also, Churchill said that although Italy has suffered internal strife, it is still cooperating with Germany toward a common goal. This is also a matter of concern for Britain and the United States.</p>

<p>Director Delivered a Welcoming Speech</p>
<p>During the banquet, the welcoming speech was given by Wu Yunqi (representing Zheng Hongyan), the director on duty of the New Opening Federation. He stated: "Today, the News Federation is hosting the newly appointed Chief of the Reporting Department of the Army, Mr. Izubuchi. We are honored that Chief Izubuchi has personally attended, along with Mr. Akaboshi, Mr. Koike from the Army Department, and colleagues from the news industry. The News Federation has long planned to welcome and host Chief Izubuchi since his appointment, but we were unable to do so because the Chief was in Beijing on official business. We are even more excited to see the Chief's elegant demeanor today. The News Federation has been able to progress smoothly under the cooperation and guidance of the Army and Qing Army authorities since its establishment, and we are deeply grateful for that cooperation. The world is currently facing a situation where more guidance from the reporting authorities is needed. Chief Izubuchi has a long history in China and is very familiar with the national conditions of our people. Therefore, we hope that the Chief can give us more guidance in the future and cooperate in the development of the news industry. I, on behalf of the News Federation, wish Chief Izubuchi and all the gentlemen good health."</p>
<p>Chief Izubuchi Made a Speech</p>
<p>Chief Izubuchi stood up and gave a speech, stating: "I am deeply grateful for your taking the time to hold this grand banquet for me today. I have been in office for a month, and I had intended to meet with you all earlier to hear your valuable opinions. I apologize for being hosted first. As the Chairman mentioned, I have been serving in China for quite some time, but this is my first time working in Shanghai. I feel that the responsibility of handling the reporting work in Shanghai is very important, so I expect the efforts and assistance of all my colleagues in the news industry to help me fulfill my mission. The current situation is becoming increasingly serious, and the nations of Greater East Asia must unite and strive together. The people of China and Japan must also unite as one to cope with the current situation. You are all talented individuals in the news industry, and I hope that you will continue to work hard to cope with the arduous tasks, and I hope that the news industry in your country will develop more and more in the future and provide more assistance to us.

<h3>The First District Abolished the Fire Department's Volunteer Reserve Team</h3>
<p>The person in charge of the Shanghai Special Municipality's First District Office recently told reporters: "Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the First District Office's Fire Department Volunteer Reserve Team has seen a significant decrease in its total number of members due to the departure of British members. When the office decided to disband the team on August 6th of this year, only fourteen members remained, making it difficult to continue to perform the original duties. In view of this, the office had no choice but to abolish the team. The Volunteer Reserve Team was officially established on March 3rd, 1931. At that time, the team had as many as seventy foreign members. The following year, it was reduced to fifty members. In that year, the first incident occurred in Shanghai, and the team members assisted the regular fire brigade in extinguishing fires in Zhabei District. Later, when the China Incident occurred in 1937, the team assisted the fire department in fire-fighting work, which was extremely effective. In the same year, a "Special Support Transport Team" was established, with a total of 34 members, assisting the fire department in rescue work. The Special Support Transport Team was subsequently merged into the Fire Department Volunteer Reserve Team in 1938, greatly increasing the strength of the Volunteer Reserve Team. The Volunteer Reserve Team has consistently made outstanding contributions in assisting the fire department and has made contributions to the community. It is reported that on the day of the team's dissolution, the office sent a letter expressing its gratitude and, in order to commemorate the team's achievements, planned to issue commemorative medals to the team members who were still in the team on the date of dissolution."</p>
<h3>The Fang Jiuxia Bank Robbery Case: Continued Trial Held Yesterday, Closing Arguments Concluded, Sentencing Scheduled for the 27th</h3>
<p>Huang Cifu, a former detective from the Huishan Police Sub-bureau, attempted to rob four diamond rings from the Fang Jiuxia Silver Shop on Nanjing Road. When the shop raised the alarm, Huang used his official handgun to resist arrest, fatally shooting Indian constable Terripu Xin and Shen Heqing Jiang, a member of the civilian medical corps. Huang was subsequently apprehended and handed over to the former First Special District Court. Huang's lawyers, Zhu Gu, and Tao Wuzhi, argued that Huang suffered from a congenital, hereditary mental illness and requested a psychiatric evaluation. The court ordered a postponement for this purpose. Yesterday, the case was heard by the current Shanghai Local Court in the Third Criminal Division.</p>
<p>Heavy Security</p>
<p>To prevent any unforeseen incidents, Du Bingjun, the Chief Prosecutor of the Shanghai Local Procuratorate, specially dispatched Inspector Ma of the Judicial Police Brigade, along with over twenty fully armed forensic officers, to assist Pan Junchang, the leader of the Judicial Police Group stationed at the court, in securing the area inside and outside the court. The Xihongkou Police Sub-bureau also sent officers on duty to the court. Xiao Linfeng Saburo, the Deputy Director of the Judicial Affairs Department of the First Police Bureau, and Liu Shaokui, the head of the Compilation and Intelligence Section, also personally attended the court. The level of security was unprecedented. At 9:30 AM, Zhao Zhengfang, the President of the Local Court, with Judge Wu Kechou and Chief Prosecutor Qian Sensheng presiding, brought the defendant Huang Cifu for questioning. Two Chinese constables supported Huang, who stood in the defendant's dock, swaying from side to side and muttering to himself. President Zhao began by asking Huang his age, name, and origin, but Huang did not answer. President Zhao then instructed him, "Do not feign madness. Know that today is your last opportunity to argue your case. If there is anything that benefits you, you can explain it as much as possible now, otherwise there will be no further opportunity for defense." But Huang still did not answer.</p>
<p>Summary of the Prosecution</p>
<p>The President then ordered a retrial of the case and asked the prosecutor to present the summary of the prosecution. Prosecutor Qian then stated, "The defendant, at twelve noon on July 18th of this year, at the Fang Jiuxia Silver Shop at No. 479 Nanjing Road, purchased a ring, then took it outside under the pretext of looking at the light, and then fled. When the shop employees shouted 'Thief!' he encountered an Indian constable and civilian medical corps members. The defendant then opened fire, killing one Indian constable and two civilians. The former Municipal Council is prosecuting him for robbery and murder," and so on. The families of the victims also hired lawyers Mao Xianshen, Cheng Zhengping, and Ji Chao, among others, to file civil suits, totaling 284,000 yuan for Shen Heqing and 840,000 yuan for Jiang E. President Zhao again questioned the defendant about the homicides. The defendant remained silent. After repeated urging by President Zhao, he finally muttered vaguely, saying that he did not know anything about the incident, that he only went there on official business, and had nothing else to say.</p>
<p>Witness Testimony</p>
<p>Jiang Jun, the brother of Jiang E, and Shen Hengfu, the younger brother of Shen Heqing's aunt, Zhen Zhu, then took turns requesting justice for the deceased and proper handling of the case. Next, witness Tao Liqing testified that he and Lu Shilin were inside a room at the Great Shanghai Hotel when they heard a theft alarm. They went downstairs to investigate and saw the defendant wrestling on the ground with a member of the civilian medical corps. Tao and Lu stepped forward and took the handgun from the defendant. Xu Banfang and Zhang Zhonglie, shop employees of Fang Jiuxia, testified that the defendant came on July 18th noon to buy a ring. "We handed him four rings. Who knew the defendant would make the excuse of looking at them in the light, and then flee. We then shouted 'Thief!' The defendant ran across the road. We heard gunshots. Before the incident, he did not seem mentally unstable. He was no different from a normal person. We did not know he was a detective," and so on. Chinese Constable No. 102 also testified to assisting in the arrest and said that he knew at the time that he was a "Bao Detective." After the arrest, when asked why he shot so many people, the defendant replied that he was having a mental breakdown.</p>
<p>Forensic Evaluation</p>
<p>President Zhao stated that someone suffering from a mental illness would not be able to claim to have a mental illness. He then ordered the reading of the evaluation report by forensic doctor Hou Guangji. The report stated in essence: "During the examination of the defendant during this period, his appetite was normal, he was aware of his bowel movements, and his patellar reflexes were normal. No violent behavior was observed within 24 hours a day. His demeanor was calm, but he mumbled in his mouth, and his hands and head were often moving. Aside from alcohol-induced mania, there is no obvious possibility of a mental illness. He should be considered free of illness." The report was then given to the defendant's lawyer. Considering the facts of the case were clear, and the defendant had no testimony, he was waiving his right to speak. He then ordered the start of closing arguments. Prosecutor Qian Sensheng argued that according to the forensic report, the defendant was determined to be free of mental illness. Moreover, someone with a mental illness could not be a civil servant. However, since the defendant went to buy a diamond ring, it did not seem like coercion, but rather fraud. Therefore, he should be sentenced according to fraud and ordinary murder. Finally, the defendant's lawyer, Zhu Hui, argued that the facts of the case were undisputed, but the defendant did indeed have a congenital, hereditary mental illness, and had been deeply stimulated by various factors. On one occasion, due to ulcerative colitis, the segment of his intestine that was removed was larger than that of a normal person. He brought the removed section of intestine as evidence, and this incident should be considered to reduce his penalty. The court ordered the closing arguments concluded and scheduled sentencing for the morning of the 27th of this month. The defendant was remanded to custody, and the attached civil suits were transferred to the civil court for handling.</p>

<h3>Streamlining the Second Line of Production</h3>
<p>The recent National Policy Outline decided by the friendly nation of Japan includes a point on streamlining the second line of production as a special measure to strengthen the domestic situation. Streamlining the second line of production means streamlining various external organizations, various control agencies, and control companies in the second line of production, while thoroughly refreshing and reducing the number of personnel in their operations and affairs. In addition, the price and allocation system, which is closely linked to streamlining the second line of production, seeks to thoroughly simplify it.</p>
<p>Because the various organizations on the second line of production were originally created out of necessity and developed with the changes of the times, there is a need to refresh them at any time in their operation. As for the price and allocation system, in order to eliminate the current malpractices, it is necessary to simplify it.</p>
<p>Based on this idea, we believe that our country's second line of production and allocation system should strive to emulate our friendly nation of Japan. Therefore, in our recent editorial "What Happens After the Purchase of Gauze?" we believed that the fewer steps involved in the allocation procedure of cotton gauze, the better, so as not to cause the final recipient to suffer both time and economic losses. In our hypothetical allocation procedure, we must again accommodate the current organizational system of the Commercial Control Association, so we believe that if the level of the federation can be eliminated, the handling will be more agile, so we said, "In the allocation system, wholesalers are superfluous and profit-sharing, and there is no need for their existence." As for the personnel in our control institutions, is there any "creation of positions for people?" Is everyone "making the most of their talents?" That is another part of the problem, and we will not discuss it here.</p>
<p>In short, our advocacy is precisely to demand the refreshing of the control mechanism and the simplification of the allocation system.</p>

<h3>Guangtian, Chief of Intelligence, Discusses America's Invasion of East Asia, Elaborating on the Process of America's Invasion of the Philippines</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report: The joint press conference of the Japanese Army Overseas and the Shanghai Standing Bureau was held yesterday (the 23rd) at 3 p.m. on the fifth floor of the Astor House Hotel. Guangtian, the Chief of Intelligence of the Shanghai Office of the Embassy, attended with Deputy Consul Tongfuwen. Lieutenant Yantian of the propaganda department attended. During the meeting, Chief of Intelligence Guangtian gave a speech on America's plot to invade East Asia, detailing the Roosevelt uncle and nephew's policies of invading the Philippines. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Invasion of East Asia</p>
<p>Chief Guangtian first stated, "President Roosevelt recently gave a lecture-style speech in Congress, the content of which was empty and insignificant. However, according to the content, it is enough to expose the past actions of Roosevelt, who represented the vanguard of America's invasion of East Asia. His uncle, Theodore Roosevelt, was also a person who represented America's invasion of East Asia in his time. Therefore, the Roosevelt uncle and nephew are truly a pair of living treasures of two generations in America. Judging from their views on the past records of invading East Asia, they were truly the implementers of the policy of invading the Philippines." Guangtian continued, "Burma has already declared its independence on August 1st, and the Philippines will also formally declare its independence soon. He also said that the Philippines was at war with Spain from 1898 to 1899, and as a result, America won and seized the territory of the Philippines. The reason for America's victory at that time was actually due to America's cunning towards the Philippines, falsely promising the Philippines independence. Unexpectedly, afterwards, it went against its promise. However, in 1934, the American government passed the Philippine Independence Act, but it had to wait until 1945 to achieve complete independence. America did not want the Philippines to gain independence. Therefore, the so-called 1945 is likely to be postponed at that time.</p>
<p>Two Generations of Conspiracy</p>
<p>Guangtian also said: "However, based on historical evidence, America's invasion of East Asia began with the Philippines. In America's policy of invading East Asia, these two generations of Roosevelts were both the main figures in colluding to invade the Philippines. The former American advocates of expansionism argued that since its founding, America's strength was limited to the thirteen states, advocating development to the Pacific coast. After the Spanish-American War, America occupied the entire Philippines, establishing a base in East Asia. Although there were supporters domestically, there were also many opponents, confronting each other. As a result, the expansionists won. However, the reason for America's successful occupation of the Philippines was also that it achieved its ambition to invade Cuba. Thus, Theodore Roosevelt's conspiracy was realized by him. Looking at this world war, the culprit that ignited this great war was the attempt to dominate the world. In order to achieve his desire for the Far East, Roosevelt did not hesitate to instigate conflict between China and Japan behind the scenes, and even imposed economic pressure on Japan. Therefore, Franklin Roosevelt was truly the successor of America's traditional policy of invading East Asia, using the same methods as his uncle.</p>
<p>Taking Independent Measures</p>
<p>Looking back at the conspiracy before the Spanish-American War, at that time, the American warship Maine, which was docked in Cuba, exploded and sank. Theodore Roosevelt made great use of this incident, attempting to expand it. In February, before the war with Spain, Roosevelt secretly instructed the commander of the American East Asia Fleet stationed in Hong Kong, Dewey, that once the war between America and Spain began, he should immediately dispatch to the Philippines and launch a surprise attack on the Spanish fleet docked in Manila Bay. At that time, Roosevelt was still the Under Secretary of the Navy, yet he independently issued this order. The actions of the current Roosevelt are very similar to those of his uncle. Before the Far East War broke out, Roosevelt used economic problems to put various pressures on Germany, Italy, and Japan. Everyone present is already clearly aware of this. Three months before the outbreak, in early September of the previous year, Roosevelt ordered the American fleet to attack German submarines if they encountered them at sea. Therefore, this statement is enough to prove that these two generations of Roosevelts were completely instigators of war, and can even be said to be manipulators of war.</p>
<p>Deceitful and Scheming</p>
<p>Regarding Uncle Roosevelt's attitude towards the Philippines, when the Spanish-American War broke out on April 24, 1898, the American East Asia Fleet, docked in Hong Kong, was ordered by Dewey to set sail for Manila Bay and destroyed the Spanish fleet on May 1. However, America did not have land forces. America then reached an understanding with the Philippine independence activist, Aguinaldo's army. America finally obtained this assistance and pacified the security of the entire Philippine territory, falsely promising the Philippines independence on May 24 of that year. In June, Aguinaldo was elected president. This uncle saw that his plan was successful. Not long after, Roosevelt suddenly mediated, sending 10,000 domestic troops to the Philippines, occupying Manila, controlling Aguinaldo's independent army, and plotting its destruction. This kind of method was Uncle Roosevelt's scheming and self-interested means. And now Franklin Roosevelt's actions are exactly the same as his uncle's. Furthermore, Uncle Roosevelt's restriction of the Philippines' independence was entirely a plan based on American economic principles. Because the Philippines is an agricultural country, a large number of field products are transported to the United States, and non-agricultural products are abundant and cheap. The interests of the two countries are contrary. Taking sugar as an example, America abandoned the import of Philippine sugar to the United States, partially using tariffs to benefit its own agricultural interests. In addition, it restricted immigration to the Philippines. Furthermore, before the Great East Asia War, Franklin Roosevelt sent Executive Officer General MacArthur to the Philippines to plan the construction of the Philippine army, expanding and strengthening it. On the one hand, he interfered in the Philippines' internal affairs and diplomacy, and on the other hand, he established military bases. This situation is no different from America's previous facilities on Cuba. America's granting of independence to the Philippines is only in name and not in reality. Therefore, the conspiracies of the two generations of Roosevelts are the invaders and challengers of East Asia.</p>
<h3>Military Allocation Group Delivers Large Quantities of Miscellaneous Grains for Sale at Affordable Prices by Guben Company</h3>

It is heard that the bank originally planned to hold the lottery at the end of this month, but it was changed to October 2nd due to a conflict with the lottery date of the Central Construction Association's special savings bonds.</p>
<h3>Flour Production of Various Factories Reaches Two Million Bags</h3>
<p>After the completion of the first phase of wheat purchase in various regions of Central China, various flour mills have resumed work one after another. It is heard that since the start of work, the flour mills in this city have produced no less than two million bags of flour. A part of it has been supplied to the local people's needs, and more than one million bags have been transported to North China as material exchange. Therefore, there are about 500,000 bags in storage in Shanghai. According to reporters, the distribution of wheat flour in this city is still handled by the original organization. The first and eighth districts are temporary inspection offices, and the urban area is the Japanese wheat flour distribution group.</p>

<h3>Summary of Market Conditions</h3>

<p>Rice and Grain - Not many South Port rice shipments arrived at the rice market. Retail sales were flat. A lot of caged goods were thrown out, so the situation was gradually loosening. As a result, the new japonica rice and aged broken rice fell again slightly, and white yuan was also weak.</p>
<p>Gunny Bags - Weak for a long time, recently there have been slight changes, but the market price has made little progress.</p>

Although transactions were still sparse, the market has become firmer. Shops on the street in the city added 13% green tea, and 22 boxes of black tea were sold at the same time.

<h3>After Badoglio's Surrender, Germany's Determination to Fight Becomes More Resolute</h3>
<p>What impact will the defection of Badoglio, the traitor of the Axis powers, have on the world war situation? How will Germany, which is fighting the enemy in the east and hopes to win, cope with the future war situation? Sato, the Berlin branch manager of the Mainichi Shimbun, reported to Tokyo via international telegraph as follows:</p>
<p>Mainichi Shimbun:</p>
<p>How does Germany view the surrender of the Badoglio government?</p>
<p>Kato: According to the German Foreign Ministry today, Badoglio's betrayal is a planned criminal act. His crime is the most vicious betrayal of the fascist regime centered on Mussolini and of the true representatives of the Italian people. Since Mussolini's tragic dismissal, Germany has long expected this to happen, so it is not panicked or shaken at all. The government's announcement shows that the German people are calm.</p>
<p>Our company: Japan is also equally calm. This must be because Japan and Germany are both thoroughly convinced of their inevitable victory. What about the so-called new fascist government established in northern Italy?</p>
<p>Kato: That has already been announced. The German people were very happy to hear that the Fascist Party, representing the true intentions of the Italian people, resolutely rose up to cooperate in completing the war against Britain and the United States. Their morale was greatly boosted, and they wholeheartedly applauded their support. Today, in addition to the establishment of the new government, the details of its organization, structure, etc. are still unclear. What form the government will use to cooperate in defeating Britain and the United States, and the composition of the army supporting the government are also not clear. The location of the government seems to be a small city in northern Italy near the German-Italian border.</p>
<p>German Army's Strategy in Italy</p>
<p>Our company: What will the German army's future operations in Italy be like?</p>
<p>Kato: The enemy forces will continue to land in various parts of Italy. However, the German army's strategy of defeating the landing enemy forces has not changed at all. Letting the enemy forces land in various places is not a sign of indecision or inability to cope, but is based on a predetermined strategy to lure the enemy forces to the north and then annihilate them in one fell swoop. Furthermore, the German army had minor conflicts with the Italian army in the south, and there may still be more to come, but that has no impact on the overall war situation.</p>
<p>Our company: What about the Italian army on the Eastern Front and in the Balkans?</p>
<p>Kato: The Italian army on the Eastern Front has now been moved to the rear. Their number is not a problem.</p>
<p>Our company: What is the situation of the Japanese in Italy?</p>
<p>Kato: The connection between Berlin and Rome has been cut off, so everything is unclear. In short, in our view, the era of exalting the spirit of the Axis powers and consolidating unity has passed. Japan and Germany, as well as the reborn fascist new government, should become truly one and march towards defeating Britain and the United States with the belief in inevitable victory—that is the most important thing. The German people generally think so too.</p>
<p>Our company: What was the national morale in response to Hitler's speech on the 10th of this month?</p>
<p>Kato: The people of Berlin were very excited about it. The German Morning News of the 11th, of course, reported it extensively. The main points of the speech: First, the impact of Italy's secession on Germany's overall war situation is extremely small. Second, the speech fully expressed Hitler's friendship with Mussolini. Third, he used strong and angry tones towards Badoglio's infidelity, arousing the public's sympathy and giving them great encouragement.</p>
<p>German People's Fighting Spirit is High</p>
<p>The German people's impression of this speech so far is that the heavy burden of fighting alongside the cumbersome Italian army, which was unclear whether it was friend or foe, has now been lifted. From now on, they can use all their energy to fight Britain and the United States according to their own will. The unclear atmosphere before today has been swept away. With the spirit of the people as the backdrop, the President's Headquarters announced that it would actively implement the aftermath of Italy's betrayal according to plan. Many strategic locations, one after another, have fallen into the hands of the German army. The disarmament of the Italian army is also proceeding smoothly. Therefore, the German people are very happy.</p>
<p>Our company: How is the German army deployed?</p>
<p>Kato: Judging from the fact that German generals Rommel and Kesselring are stationed in Italy, Germany's determination can be understood. Before today, Germany had to bear the heavy burden of maritime transport at any time to confront the British and American forces. Now the situation has changed. It is they who cannot do without maritime transport, while Germany can start its most得意 land war and confront Britain and the United States. This time will make them taste Germany's strength and give them a head-on blow. The actively implemented post-war strategy is proof of this. Churchill and Roosevelt issued a joint statement calling on the Italian people to "trust the British and Americans in the war with Germany," which led to the surrender of the Italian army. But from a fair perspective, the war situation is right for Germany. Among the Italian army, those who have the courage to cooperate with Germany and go to the enemy's side are cowardly troops, so Churchill and Roosevelt have obtained this kind of army, which is of no use in the war against Germany. In the current situation, British and American forces have already landed with considerable forces in southern Italy. In the north, the German army is stubbornly resisting, and Italy is divided into two parts, which has the potential to become a major battlefield.</p>
<p>Our company: What will happen to the Badoglio regime after this?</p>
<p>Kato: Badoglio has already fled Rome. It is not known where he has gone. He is probably in southern Italy or Sicily! The treacherous regime seems to have become a fugitive regime. It is also unclear what will happen to the cadres within the Badoglio regime.</p>
<p>Our company: How will the fascist regime that was born in northern Italy be active in the future?</p>
<p>The Movements of the New Government in Northern Italy</p>
<p>Kato: It will be very active. The personnel of the government will be announced in one or two days. It is said that former Fascist Party Secretary-General Farinacci, former Minister of Culture and Propaganda Buffarini, and Mussolini's son Vittorio Mussolini will be the leaders. Nominally, it will still use Mussolini's form.</p>
<p>Our company: What about Italy's navy?</p>
<p>Kato: British intelligence says that part of the Italian navy has already fled to Malta. Of course, part of the one in Taranto has escaped, and part of the one in La Spezia has also escaped. So, it is true that some have escaped to Malta and Gibraltar. But Germany's methods are also very clever. Some were detained before they escaped, and some were sunk while escaping, so the enemy did not get that many.</p>
<p>The Surrender of Italian Warships is Worth Paying Attention to</p>
<p>But we must not forget that British and American forces have already landed on the Italian mainland, and their control of the Mediterranean Sea has been strengthened to some extent. A part of the Italian fleet has been captured. Therefore, the enemy's passage through the Mediterranean Sea is more free, and the pressure they exert on the Indian Ocean will also be strengthened. From Japan's point of view, this fact cannot be overlooked. (翔: Translated from the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun on September 11 and 13)</p>

<h3>What is Expected After the Purchase of Cotton Yarn and Cloth</h3>
<p>— Shui Zhaoxiong</p>
<p>The purchase of cotton yarn and cloth is like a thunderbolt on a sunny day. Its impact and consequences are profound and enormous. As far as leveling prices is concerned, the common people are all excited! However, the implementation of the policy must be comprehensive and thorough, so that the effect is universal and benefits all beings. I, who serve in the cotton textile industry association, would like to briefly describe my hopes after the purchase from the point of view of maintaining the production industry of my colleagues!</p>
<p>China's cotton textile factories are still in their infancy. Their capital is generally small, and their equipment is mostly simple. Most factories are alley factories, no different from alley elementary schools, lurking in various alleys and scattered throughout the city, which are small and many manufacturers. However, the number of citizens who rely on it for work and life, directly and indirectly, is no less than one million. In addition, processing, dyeing, and finishing are all handled by other factories, so the number of people related to this industry is more than ten thousand! On weekdays, the machines and workers in the factory are already packed without gaps, let alone have room to store raw materials. Since the movement of yarn and raw坯 has been prohibited, the raw materials in the factory have long been exhausted. Although the raw materials stored in the foreign stacks are within the prescribed reserve, they are not enough to solve the urgent need, and they can only sigh at the opportunity! To date, the number of factories that have successively stopped work is increasing day by day, and the workers who rely on them for life have nothing to rely on. If this continues, the future of people's livelihood is really worrisome!</p>
<p>Then how to deal with it? It is easy. If cotton yarn and cloth are illegally hoarded, it will be enough to endanger the foundation of the country. If the government purchases it and uses it for legitimate production and exchange of food, as long as management and operation are proper, it will not be difficult to restore production in an instant and save the people from water and fire. What is the method? First, the purchase and distribution should be quick. Delay will inevitably lead to the death of the factory. Second, the distribution must be organized and orderly. Confusion will make it difficult to achieve practical results.</p>
<p>Why should the purchase and distribution be quick? Since the factory's raw materials have been applied for sale, and most of them are stored in foreign stacks, the raw materials within the reserve amount cannot be moved. Therefore, the number of factories that have stopped work will inevitably increase, workers will lose their jobs, and employees will be idle, making it more difficult for the factory to maintain. Now that the hope of distribution has not been cut off, the factory is in a half-open state, and the employees are in a half-idle state. The workers are inquiring about the news of the start of work every day. The state of their wandering and dispersal is indescribable. Therefore, we urgently hope that the purchase will be completed as soon as possible, and the distribution will be implemented as soon as possible, in order to reverse the worrying situation. In addition, if the raw materials stored in foreign stacks are under proper circumstances, the factory should be allowed to move them to maintain production, which is also an urgent matter.</p>
<p>What is meant by distribution must be organized and orderly? The purchase of cotton yarn and cloth is prepared for long-term wartime use, so the distribution must be organized and orderly in order to facilitate management and avoid waste. In particular, it must be in line with the actual situation, and adjustments and supplements should be made to supplement the lack of production, so as to avoid affecting the livelihood of laborers. Now, I will try to describe the initial plan of distribution as follows, in order to serve as a reference when the authorities discuss the method:</p>
<p>A. The style of the products of the allocated raw materials should be specified. Since the allocation is prepared for long-term use, people's consumption should be restricted. There are many varieties of products and many raw materials are consumed. To save consumption, the first thing to do is to simplify the products. Therefore, it is appropriate to specify several styles of daily necessities for easy manufacturing.</p>
<p>B. Stipulate appropriate profits for factories and wholesale and retail merchants. If the profits are stipulated appropriately, the selling price will inevitably be reasonable. The stock in the market will be continuously produced due to the new goods, and the price will be appropriate. Therefore, the original selling price will naturally be flattened without pressure.</p>
<p>C. Factories should be "linked" to produce in order to facilitate distribution. Cotton textile factories vary in size. The organization is different. It is difficult to achieve the effect of control by distributing them among more than a thousand factories. If ten families can be combined into one "link", then a thousand families will only have one hundred "link". Distributing to hundreds of "links" will be twice as effective with half the effort.</p>
<p>D. Workers should be registered, work in shifts, and wages should be increased. The number of workers in the city is large, and they all belong to the production class, and they are all entrusted with the national lifeline. If they are allowed to be displaced, how can it be the country's happiness? Furthermore, the allocation of raw materials must be continued for a long time, and should not be "taken and demanded" casually. Imitating the "linking" of factories, workers should also be registered and "linked", work in shifts, and increase wages to maintain their livelihoods, so that national strength can still be preserved. Moreover, since the price of raw materials is low, increasing wages will never affect the selling price of the products.</p>
<p>E. Provide loans to factories and regulate factory funds. Factories are the source of national vitality. After their stocks have been purchased, the capital is sluggish and exhausted. It is necessary to assess their actual needs, provide loans to factories, and maintain them, so that revitalization can be expected.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned matters may already be under consideration by the Standing Bureau. There is no need for excessive worries from the people. However, this matter is of great importance to our country's cotton textile industry, so the expectation is as strong as a drought望雲兒. I think the authorities will definitely take appropriate measures to meet our high expectations!</p>

<h3>Method for Safely Storing Citizen Certificates</h3>
<p>Recently, incidents of lost citizen certificates have occurred from time to time, mostly due to improper storage. In my opinion, the most important thing is to never put the citizen certificate together with banknotes. It is best to put it in a cloth bag and hang it on your belt to avoid losing it. Fortunately, the weather is getting colder, and this can definitely be put into practice. If not, the citizen certificate should be put in an envelope with your detailed address written on it, along with postage stamps, and the words "Kind Sir/Madam, please drop this into a mailbox." This way, if someone finds it, they can drop it into a mailbox to be returned. However, the envelope does not need to be sealed, so that it can be used for citizen certificate checks at any time.

<h3>Improving the Paste at Post Offices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, when I went to the Sichuan Road Post Office to mail a letter, I saw that the quality of the paste provided by the bureau was very poor (probably made from sorghum flour). It had no stickiness at all. Moreover, the postage stamps sold now are not as good as before. After the stamps are pasted, they easily fall off. I sincerely hope that the bureau will improve and use the black flour it used to use, which is much better. (Liu)</p>
