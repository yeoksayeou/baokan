<p>社評</p>
<h3>盼望殷富階級自動捐款</h3>
<p>上海各界華北急賑會成立以後，對於籌募賑款工作，正在多方面推進之中，我們前已屢屢言之，救災如救火，絕對須以迅速敏捷，處理一切。側聞急賑會各當局，也頗能重視這一點，一反迂廻曲折，官樣文章的習氣，這是堪以欣慰的事。我們認爲這樣的作風，如能貫澈到底，則其結果，當然直接受惠的是華北災民。而另方面各界人士對這樣的辦賑，而發生了信賴心，願意多多的捐助，因之充實捐款數目，雄厚施賑力量，多救華北災民，也是意想中的事。</p>
<p>我們曾經同意林康侯先生的建議，如果等到捐款收足了。才辦賑物，才去施放，那是緩不濟急的，必須先向國家銀行墊借款項，然後將收得的捐款陸績歸還。這個辦法，就情與理而言，似乎都行得通的。因爲國家銀行是政府設置的，賑濟災民，原是政府的責任。林康侯先生，現在已是急賑會的實際負責人之一，那麼，、相信林先生必定已在竭力促使他的建議的實現吧！</p>
<p>不過，我們雖然建議銀行墊款，可是，墊了款總得歸還，所以，將如何加緊籌募捐款，還是最主要的課題。歸還墊款也好，直接辦賑物也好，總究要有賑款，才可以運用的。</p>
<p>籌募捐款的方法，急賑會已經定有方案，依照執行。可是，這種方案的本質，母寗說是「一相情願」的，其實，完全寄托在捐款人的自動自發的同情心上面。如果捐款人的同情心發動得不熱烈，那末，方案就成了具文，方案裏的規定，就得不到效果。這不是說方案是無用的，而是說更需要鼓起捐款人高度的同情心，熱烈輸將，然後，這方案才獲得了實際的效果。譬如方案規定舉辦一個球類義賽，門券售得比平常特別高，我們就希望有力量而歡喜球賽的人，先自發動同情災民的心理，不計較票價與球賽的相稱與吾，而應有「沒有球看也須捐的」慷慨精神，把看球賽當作「外快」。有這樣的心理支持這義賽，參加就熱烈，收入就增加，方案就收到實效了。</p>
<p>我們今天赤誠的代表華北災民敬向全市市民—尤其是殷富階級的仕女們，表示最懇切的熱望，自動自發最高度的同情心，慷慨解囊，踴躍輸捐，各就急賑會指定的附近各銀行錢莊交納捐款，多多益善，源源不絕。我們細察新聞報及本報發表的過去代收捐款名單以及交款時的實際情形。固然有少數殷富階級的捐款，但是薪水與勞苦階級的實佔多數。我們雖然不敢說愈是殷富階級，愈是一味自己享受而缺乏同情心。但是，目前的事實，也的確薪水與勞苦階級的同情心比較高。反過來說，殷富階級的數量，并不如勞苦階級的多，所以捐款人數比不上勞苦階級，。但是，我們要武斷的說一句，凡是在華燈初上的時候，所有在上海各家貴族化的舞廳，菜館，茶室，旅館，戲院等塲所，興高采烈的仕女們，都是夠得上殷富階級的資格，這一個人數，決計不會太少的。我們敬懇這般仕女們，自動自發人類最高尙的同情心，每决節餘一部分所費，送交就近的代收賑款機關，我們相信這個數目，也一定比薪水與勞苦大衆的貢獻來得多。在殷富階級似乎九牛一毛，而華北災民將當作義粟仁漿了。</p>
<p>我們更進一步向殷富階級貢獻一點管見。對於捐錢的人生觀，我們已曾申論過。捐錢爲個人放遠眼界，看淸利害的一種高尙至善至樂的行爲，爲一種發乎深心，出乎至誠，最高尙的道德表現，固非他人所能絲毫加以强迫。但諺云：「富人一席酒。窮人半年糧。」今且「富人一席酒，十條災民命」了。人非木石，焉得不動其同情之心，而表現其最高之道德？至於萬人飢寒，我獨享樂，聚集多金，藏不爲用，更是不仁不義，爲財所迷。焉得不放遠眼界，助人以自助，表現至善至樂之行爲？總之，藏錢無益，徒以自累，或且累及子孫。用之得當，乃不負錢。聚而不用，是爲錢迷。捐我所餘，拯人於死，用乃得當，在我亦樂。因此，更赤誠盼望全市殷富階級的仕女們發動最高同情，慷慨輸捐，災黎幸甚。</p>
<p>此外，本市華北急賑會旣經成立，已有統籌的領導機關，爲集中力量起見，一切賑務，自應由該會主持。譬如本報代收捐款，原爲該會未成立前權宜辦法，今該會已指定行莊代收，自當移轉，已於昨日起停止代收。希望本市各方面關於賑災華北的行動，不能各自爲政，徒然分散力量。這在同一賑濟災民的目的之下，爲集中事權，增强力量，所應有的步驟。希望在急賑會未成立以前的各別組織，從速與該會取得密切聯絡，一致進行。</p>

<h3>國防會議通過　戰時文化宣傳綱要　特任榮臻張學銘爲軍事委員</h3>
<p>南京十日中央社電　十日最高國防會議開第十七次會議，討論各重要議案，其中最重要者爲主席交議戰時文化宣傳政策基本綱要一案，該案計分第一方針，第二要領，第三實施三部份，要領部份分七項，實施部份分十一項，對於國民戰時意識之强化，中國文化之重建，東亞文化之復興，均有明確之規定。該案送由國民政府公佈，全國一律遵行，以爲戰時文化宣傳之最高準則。又衛生署組織法草案，原則亦經通過。准先照辦交立法院審議。至於人事方面特任榮臻張學銘爲軍事委員會委員。</p>
<p>南京十日中央社電　第十七次最高國防會議通過之軍事委員會新任委員榮臻張學銘兩氏，均爲舊東北軍。按榮臻委員本年六十餘歲，爲東北軍張作霖將軍之部屬，數仟團旅師長以至於東北邊防軍總參謀長，新近參加和運之榮子恒中將，即爲其長子。事變後榮氏息影北平，然甚關心國事。此次以東北前輩之資格，受仟國府軍委即有其意義。張學銘氏係爲張學良將軍之弟，曾任東北軍旅長等職。（少將銜）事變後任天津警備司令等職，爲當時華北政界有力人物。張氏旋往西羊各國硏究軍事。於大東亞戰爭暴發前二月歸港。彼時張氏即有意參加和運，本年曾飛京晋謁政府當局，深受當局器重。此次被任軍委後，中樞軍事機構之人事更見強化。張氏雖僅四十餘歲，英姿蓬勃，實爲一純正軍人型人物。</p>
<h3>晋察冀邊區日軍　上月間綜合戰虹</h3>
<p>石門十日中央社電　當地日軍某部隊十日發表，此次日軍掃蕩晋察　邊區共軍之五月綜合戰果（包括冀西作戰）及中國武裝團體所獲戰果如决：（一）日軍綜合戰果，爲交戰决數五四一次，共軍交戰兵力九一八人，共軍棄屍三五一三具，被俘二二五七人，日軍奪獲迫擊砲卅門，重機槍一挺，輕機槍卅三挺，步槍一〇八三架，自動步槍十六架，剌刀六四五柄，重機槍彈一〇〇發，輕機槍彈八九五發，步槍彈五六八八八發，粉碎設施二四七處。（二）與中國武裝團體之戰果，交戰决數廿三次，共軍交戰兵力一一〇二人，共軍棄屍一七一具，被俘二五一人，奪獲共軍迫擊砲一門，輕機槍一挺，步槍六十八枝，自動步槍六枝，手槍七十五枝。</p>
<h3>北平日記者觀光　團　覲謁主席致敬</h3>
<p>南京十日中央社電　北平日本記者首都觀光團於昨日（十日）上午參觀中央陸軍軍官學校，下午訪謁林宣傳部長，周財政部長，梅實業部長等。又於下午四時赴主席官邸晋謁主席致敬。茲悉該團等一行於今十一日早車赴滬。</p>
<h3>渝方亢旱爲災　粮食极感恐慌</h3>
<p>南京十日中央社電　最近愉方治下各地糧食之不足情况，因農產之减少，加之軍隊之强制征收及旱亢爲災，故於此靑黃不接時期，更趨深刻。據此間所接確實消息稱，最近華南方面渝方治下各地之旱災實爲近年所罕見。餓莩　道，哀鴻遍野，慘不忍睹。緣粵閩兩省渝方治下各地，於三四五三月內雨量奇缺，影響農作至巨。因此渝方（閩粵贛邊區總司令）香翰屛特發出布吿，爲救濟難民決使之開墾南豐，宜黄峽。江水豐等地，（均在贛省）耕田八萬五千畝，聞預定收容五萬災民，但流入該地之難民，現已超過十萬，故食糧更感不足。該地現巳餓死一萬零五百人，因此難民乃紛紛逃入和平地區，聞日有數千人之多，但此等難民多於未抵目的地前，即餓斃中途，而渝方各縣政府及邊區司令部亦仟其暴露。顧此情况，渝方因食糧恐慌之結果，更將促進其治下民衆羨慕和平矣。</p>
<h3>秋委中小學敎科書　各書讓卽發售</h3>
<p>南京十日中央社電　國定中小學敎科書，自發行以還，早經全國各地學校一體遵用，近悉敎育部以據民國三十二年春季國定敎科書總配給處呈報，本年春季國定敎科書配給事務，已於今月底全部結束。至關於本年秋季國定中小舉敎科書總經理事宜，已由上海出版界各大書店合資組設中國聯合出版股份有限公司負責承辦，亦經呈奉敎育部批准在案。頃據敎育部負責人員發表稱，今後國定中小學敎科書推行經售等事當求普遍，除敎部製定國定中小學敎產書經售規約飭令中國聯合出版公司遵照辦理外，並分別通飭所屬各省市敎育廳局及函請各關係機關協助推行。本屆秋季開學前，國定中小學敎科書供應事宜，其已早有準備，全國各大書店不久即可同時出售。</p>
<h3>渝共兩軍在西妝　將發生正面衝突</h3>
<p>東京十日中央社電　據此間每日新聞載上海特電，自中共發表解散（陝甘寗邊區政府等決議案後，迄已一週，而渝方猶保持沉默，此實足以證明其所受衝動之深刻，蓋中共自與莫斯科間之連繫斷絕後，爲謀自力生存起見，故以撤廢（邊區政府）對渝蔣作表面讓步，藉以巧妙躱避渝方之攻勢。同時，並乘機要求使中共獲得合法地位，以解決此多年之懸案。但渝方對於中共此項提案所採態度，雖認爲撤廢邊區政府後，渝方之政治力，至少在名義上似可仲張，而使民族統一戰綫，更趨强化，但渝方因根據此項提案，則顯然得不償失，故甚感困難。因此渝共相尅，巳因中共此次進行棄名取實之略而冉種新因。中共原假借國際共產黨支部及邊區政府之二重名義，以獲得吮吸民衆之有利立塲，而於民族統一戰綫及愛國主義之名義下，公然宣傳赤化擴展地盤。同時渝方因欲以西北爲抗戰之最後據點，故渝共雙方，於西北地區互相傾軋，演成激烈之爭奪地盤形勢，實爲必然之現象。此外與此有關而至堪注目者即渝方最近實施縮小各省面積，增加省數，以期使其政治力得以滲透於各地方。又國際共產黨解散後，中共機關報新華日報曾論稱：「中共不論國際共產黨存在與吾，仍將繼續存在，蓋目下之中央，較諸成立之時，在黨政軍各方面，俱已獲得五倍以上之飛越進展，故中共於國際共產黨解散後，仍必須銳意力謀擴大與强化，云云。觀此則渝共之必將於西北地區發生正面衝突，實可斷言。又中共於此次提案中，企圖實現國共第一次合作武漢政府時之狀態，而要求渝方承認中共爲合法黨派，俾中共黨員與渝黨員，具有同樣資格，得參與政治，且中共黨本部，得進出於重慶。但渝方對此，則至感不安。而此次中共並承認將共軍置於渝方軍委會統率之下，而要求准中共方面，保留共軍之實際指揮權，並支給全部軍費。但共軍自中日事變發生以來，名義上即已改編爲第十八集團軍，惟實際則仍悉由中共自行指揮，故其此次要求顯然仍與前决相同，僅具形式而已，且其意實當欲抹殺前年一月之新四軍事件，企圖重建新四軍。又關於軍費問題，如前於名義上隸屬於渝軍委會之共軍數萬人，目前由渝方所支給之軍費，爲數極微。蓋渝方對於直系軍隊之軍費猶覺不足，對於共軍自更無力顧及，故渝共兩軍各爲自給起見，其互爭地盤之情形，亦必將愈演而愈烈。</p>
<p>雨京十日中央社電　渝共現雖表面合作，內中仍在相互摩擦傾軋。自一九三八年四月以來，迄至最近，此種暗鬥大小已達百餘件之多。最近渝方對共黨之攻勢，日趨積極，此後雙方之相傾軋，亦更將激烈。蓋（一）最近渝方對於共黨問題擬以純粹之對內問題解決之，此種傾向自日前國際共產黨解消後益趨明顯。（二）渝方因軍事失敗，人民生活困苦，爲收消沉之民心起見，積極注重培養戰力，因此極力禁戒武派份子在內部搗亂。（三）渝方對共黨態度自將國際共黨政權解散後，雖對共黨之地位加以承認，但對於武裝團體則除渝軍以外，槪不承認。故以圖侵略渝軍地盤之共軍，處此强迫下當然受範而不平矣。</p>
<h3>接收上海法租界　外部擬定具體辦法</h3>
<p>南京十日中央社電　我政府接收津漢粵三處法國專管租界，業經圓滿完畢。關於接收上海法國租界問題，即將開始進行。昨日午後外交部部長禇民誼氏特邀接收委員審計部長夏奇峰氏至外交部討論進行方針。聞已擬定具體辦法，不日即與法國方面積極交涉云。</p>
<h3>南太平洋方面　日空軍綜合戰果　三個月中毀敵機二百餘架</h3>
<p>東京十日中央社電　南太平洋方面日美空軍之決戰，正日趨激烈。敵機雖固執企圖反攻，但日陸海兩軍航空部隊於轉進瓜達爾卡納爾島後，即積極猛炸敵軍前進基地，並邀撃來襲敵機予以重創。日陸海兩軍地上部隊亦在與航空部隊之緊密連繫之下，不分晝夜邀擊前來空襲之敵機予以重創。日軍戰果至今日已由日大本營發表：計自三月起至五月止三月間，日防空砲火單獨擊落並擊毀之敵機共達二百四十九架，此實足證明日軍高射砲及共他防空砲火威力之强，較開戰之前顯有進步，因此敵空軍不敢侵入日高射砲之威力圈內，僅在其外圍附近徘徊，此又足見敵勢力已吿單弱。又被俘之敵空軍人員對日軍高射砲之威力，莫不深爲驚異，此顯見敵方已遭受日地上防空火器之威脅。又敵機來襲南太平洋新幾內亞島所羅門羣島方面之次數，自二月以來，每月的達一千六百架，但日軍前綫將士沉着應付，與其周旋，常克服一切困難，把握防空態勢，故能獲得此次之莫大戰果，此實爲日軍不屈激鬥精神之賜，而敵機以受害過多，乃避免畫間來襲而利用夜間，但因日軍高射砲火準確無比，故敵軍常於高空投下炸彈後，即愴惶遁走，間亦有勇敢之敵機，一觀情勢有利，即調轉機首，向日本地降下以機槍掃射，故日地上防空部隊雖一分一秒亦從不稍有疎解，對空射擊允準確迅速，故敵機當即遁走。日軍地上防空部隊所擊落及擊毀之主要敵機種類，計有巨人式P38型P39型。P40型．Asa型轟炸機，均係敵方所自誇之最新式戰鬥機與轟炸機。</p>
<h3>日陸軍要員更更迭</h3>
<p>東京十日中央社電　日佐野忠義中將，前于香港作戰時，會擁立卓越武勳，其後于南方戰綫亦會樹不朽偉功，故此次突繼小林淺三郞中將之後，巳被任爲東部防衛總參謀長。又在華部隊參謀長栗林忠道中將，今亦被任爲東京師團長。又前于爪哇攻略戰而聞名之坂口靜夫中將，此次則被任爲善通寺師團長。以上三中將之異動，與松岡勝藏少將以上七名之轉任異動，日陸軍省均已于十日發表。</p>
<h3>外立巖治中將　在頃爲國捐軀</h3>
<p>東京十日中央社電　日外立巖治陸軍中將，於一月廿六日在緬甸泰國附近陣歿，享年五十二歲，氏於大正十四年陸大畢業，昭和九年任名古屋師參謀，十三年三月晋昇大佐，昭和十六年三月晋昇少將，任駐滿部隊長，十七年九月任南方第一綫部隊長。</p>
<h3>東京都制案　經日閣議通過</h3>
<p>東京十日中央社電　東京都制案於五月十一日經日內閣會議通過，並定於自七月一日起實施，東京從此即可免除府市二重行政機構之弊矣。邇來正由樞密院愼重審議其官制要綱，至九日之樞府會議中，始作最後決定。按該官制要綱以東京都機構宏大，不弱於中央各省，故決定都長官爲特任，其下置簡任之次長一名，爲都畏官之最高輔佐官。都內除長官官房外，設民生·敎育·經濟·計劃·防衛·交通·自來水·港灣八局，各局局長均爲簡任，此較現在之東京市機構（市長室九局二部）單純簡素甚多。</p>

<p>東京十日中央社電　緬甸自行政府　官巴莫氏等一行訪日後，舉國均積極向實現獨立之途邁進。自五月八日獨立準備委員會成立後，即分由各部門積極進行獨立之各項準備。頃緬甸政府政黨靑年運動關係者及產業關係者等之中堅份子，爲明瞭日本之　情，以備貢獻於新緬甸之更設起見，乃決定派遣考察團渡日訪問，以烏尼任團長，團員共廿八人·該團一行已於十日下午三時半抵門司，　定本月十二日抵東京，的逗留一週，詳細考察決戰體制下日本之行政警察產業敎育文化及其他各方面。彼等此行親身體騐戰時日本之實情後，當更加强建設新緬甸之決意。</p>
<h3>軸凡與反軸心　戰時人力比較</h3>
<p>柏林十日中央社電　據德國新聞社訊：德國勞工部長昨日對外籍記者宜稱，協約國方面之人力已減少四分之一，而軸心方面則已增加六倍。現時軸心與協約人力之比例爲九與十一，即的八萬五千萬人民係軸心方面，的十一萬萬人民係協約方面。史氏續稱，於第一次大戰時，雙方之人口爲一萬三千六百萬與十四萬一千一百萬，即的一與十之比。此次軸心方面人力六倍之增加，包括日本在內。僅在歐洲方面之軸心人力，亦有二倍半之增加，由他方面看來，在軸心歐洲每一方公里有七十二人居住，而在美國則僅七人，澳洲僅一·三人·如此則軸心歐洲及東亞人民必須尙爲生存而奮鬥。此項自然之訓練，復加以緊張之學習，更有甚者，軸心面方於技術上亦有極優經騐。史氏於其結論中聲言，德國之所以有此固定勞工，乃德國人民之健康所致。</p>

<h3>中日經濟協力之途（三）</h3>
<p>— 津島壽一</p>
<p>現在中國朝野，沒有一個不感激日方的新方針，加强國府政治力量，刷新行政機構，推進經濟施策，一切的一切，都在　進，中國民間經濟人的自主活動，協助政府施策的體制，逐步的確立，就是華北方面的政務委員會，也加强陣容，改組新民會，新設華北剿共委員會，統一加強華北剿共工作的各機關，又設置華北物資物價處理委員會，有這樣一個處理物資物價的機構，的確是面目一新。同時民問方面，也起而響應，確立協力體制，最近由華北經濟各團體及商界聯合組織。「華北物價協力委員會」這就是民間協助當局的一個明證。總之，參戰後的中國動向，就是藉中日一體結合的力量，向達到增强戰力的目的邁進，這是可以吿慰的現象。</p>
<p>在這個時候，華北的經濟地位，愈加重大，華北方面有着無盡藏的軍需物資資源和豐富的人力資源，在過去就注重開發增產，以應日本的需要，得到了相當的成綾，其中關於軍需基本物資的煤斤，業經調查明白的埋藏量，計達一千七百萬萬噸，這樣豐富的煤斤，就說是，華北遍地皆煤，也非過言，而且華北的煤，不但數量驚人，就是質地的良好，也是他處所不見的，所以其出產額，超過－預定計劃，年年增加，增加生產和增加對日輸出的兩大目的。已經完全達到。關於鐵鑛石，在龍烟，金嶺鎭及其他地方，有巨額埋藏量，除了供應當地的需要之外，同時對於其他地方的出口，還有增加數量的可能。關於製鐵、因爲有華北製鐵股份有限公司之設立，故已實施大規模的製鐵計劃，同時建設小型鎔鑛爐，以適應急需，並斟酌鐵鑛石及煤斤產地，在華北各地分別實行，業已開始製鐵，此項計劃，在實現之時必能供給巨額鋼鐵。至於礬土頁岩。在翼東及山東淄博地區蘊藏極多，它與精鋁一樣，是製造酸化鋁和火磚所不可缺的原料，現在也正在增產之中。</p>
<p>關於食鹽，長蘆，山東兩鹽塲是大東亞共榮圈各地中最大的產地，它因天賦的性格與經營得法，所以去年度的成績，大有進，步，超過了原定計劃，達到對日、供給的目的，在本年度，可望更進一步增加生產，大東亞團內工業上所用之鹽，無處匱乏，可完全依靠華北鹽。還有那戰時物資中最要緊的棉花，也實行增產計劃，華北水來是大束亞圈內供給棉花的最大根源地，這是大家所知道的。尙有其他各種重要產業。姑且不談，但是總括說一句，設法增加這些原料資源的生產，同時極力將此項原料就地製作，兼謀運送力的調節，這都是當務之急，例如上面所說的製鐵事業。以煤斤爲原料的各種工業，以鹽爲原料的化學工業，以棉花爲原料的纖維工業等，都是今後華北方面應該担負的經濟上使命，爲適應此需要起見，故已實現各項方策，今後當逐步予以推動。</p>
<p>同時，最最要緊的，就是人力和資本上的中日交流合作，我以爲這就是表現出中國參戰的眞正意義，這種事情，在華北經濟的重要部份，已經實現，今後中國方面的人力，財力。也有麥加到這種重要產業部份的希望，蓋今後每年要擴充添設各項重要產業，所需資金，預料每年數萬萬元，這許多巨額資金的調度，一部份仰給於日本內地市塲，同時儘量在當地調度，準備逐步實施。產業資金的就地調度，年來迭經提倡，可是眞正能在當地調度的產業資金，過去實在很少，所幸現在時機成熟，今後在當地必有相當巨額的資金可以獲得，自從大東亞戰爭爆發，以租界爲根據的英美系以及渝方金融機關，均已封閉，或加以統制，中國聯合準備銀行，對於華北金融的統一統制，已吿確立，金融機構，亦已就緒，存款激增，又因爲增加發行紙幣，民問資金極爲充沛，但是吸收民間資金而將其造成產業資金化，以謀金融通貨的調節，這是刻不容緩的當務之急。苒繁複的說一句，吸收民間資金而造成產業資金，這不但是收同資金，利用資金之一舉兩得的方策，而且是中日合作實現開發產業的唯一方途，確具一舉兩得的效果。所以現正使其具體化，本年度所需的開發資金，其中有種當巨額資金。考慮就地籌集。</p>
<p>最後學有一點值得重視的華北經濟動向，就是食糧物價問題，確保食糧，是戰時經濟運用的根幹問題，水來華北有一部份食糧要依靠外國的進口，沒有到達自給自足的地位，然而由於情勢的需要：急須確立自足自給體制，所以正在準備一切施策，這裏應該加以特別考慮的，就是爲整個大東亞共榮圈經濟着想，棉花的增產，期待於華北者甚大，所以華北農業的增產，須要食糧，棉花雙方並進，本來，看到華北的可耕面積，人力資源，天然條件，以及其他種種，要實行食糧棉花的兩種增產，是極可能的，不過確保食糧這件事，須要綜合大東亞共榮圈各地樹立綜合的對策，予以適常調整，物價問題，也是一種基本條件。不但是重滙產業運用上的要件，而且星整個戰時經濟的要着，但去秋迄今，華北物價奇昻，相當激烈，現在對抗抑平物價，從各種部門，硏究對策。</p>
<p>關於通貨部份，本年三月十日中國聯合凖備銀行與日本銀行締續借款契約，加强中日金融提携。表明維持日圖與聯凖鈔的比率，　月下旬，華中華南停止發行軍票新鈔，聯銀券與中儲券的交換率，和日圓對中儲券的比率同樣，也是于八圓對一百元，聯銀券的地位，漸漸提高穩固，抑制了物價的狂漲趨勢，這是値得重視的，又關於物資部份。促進其移動，整備採辦配給機構，統制物價，可望成功，不過處理物價問題，非有全體國民協力實踐，任憑怎樣努力去幹，也是不中用的，尤其是華人經濟活動節圍廣泛，所以華人起來協力統制物價，最爲重要，中國參戰，促進了此項協力精神，强化了此項實踐體制，這實在是可喜的。</p>
<p>總之，參戰後的中國，就是注主席所昭示的，完成增强戰力的最大任務，努力準備戰時經濟體制。日方也起來響應，確信此必勝不敗之體制，必然愈趨堅固。（雲鵬：譯自每日新聞）</p>

<p>義國重申作戰決心</p>
<p>柏林十日中央社電　據海通社訊：義大利政界人士特乘此參戰三週年紀念之時，重申義大利在現行戰爭中所處之特殊地位。略謂，當義大利加入德方作戰，保衛地中海權利之時，西方國家嘗調協約輔導書腹背受攻，柏林亦始終信任義大利之義動力量，潛伏至今未稍懈怠。義大利出於保衛共同利益而參戰，當時邱吉爾亦深表失望，且在義大利參戰之時，英法之地中海艦隊實力尙全，未及數年，義大利今已刺入不列顚帝國之動脈。美國雖不顧太平洋利益，已獲將軸心國驅出菲洲，但英美今在地中海仍未能自由行動。反之，軸心國以共同之政治動機，對付英美二國之力量則日强。代表歐洲在地中海抵抗英美之義大利，巴知歐洲乃吾之後盾，此亦德國與整個歐洲所同具之信心，決與敵人周旋到底云。</p>
<h3>義抗戰意志堅強　全力防衛班島　反軸心海空軍屢施襲撃　飛機一百十六架被撃落</h3>
<p>羅馬十日中央社電　突尼西亞戰局吿一段落後，反軸心軍即以全力對義本國之前後據點義領各島嶼，施行猛烈攻擊，其中班泰勒里亞島前後被炸達百四十次之多，最近反軸心軍更四次對該島加以砲擊。過去一月中，該島守備隊以沿岸砲火及高射砲擊落反軸心機百十六架，並使敵艦一艘中彈負傷。八日英艦隊復以巡洋艦砲擊班島，更勸吿義軍降伏，然義軍置之不理，反擊落敵機五架及第五十三空軍聯隊之追擊機五架，而斷然表明抗戰決意。班島義守備隊司令並動員全島居民，決心粉碎反軸心軍之登陸企匯。島民在反軸心空軍轟炸下之困難情勢中，與守備隊協力從事該島之防衛。</p>

<h3>決戰前夜的義國態勢　法國民族解放委員會的內幕</h3>
<p>（羅馬小崎特派員二日發）英美加緊空襲歐洲，並開始所謂「精神的使入歐洲。」英美對義國一面反覆的轟炸其本土及其屬島西西里，撒了島等，一面用虛構的事實，低估義國軍事，經濟的實力，宣傳「義國沒有防衛本土的實力」，並對義國的國民意志，法四政權等施行謀略宣傳，以誘發義國民衆的厭戰情緒，開始離間軸心的工作。</p>
<p>五月十六日，羅馬　方遭到初次空襲，英機在羅馬上空散發傳單，稱：「從速進行單獨和平，如不與德國　離，則義國各都市將盡成灰儘。」</p>
<p>義國在物質，精神爾方面的實力，實是軸心陣營的有力支柱。對英美的一切宣傳，不用說，自然有用事實來答覆的準備與決心。</p>
<p>自　尼西亞撤退後，義軍毫不轉變其攻擊的姿態，目前與德空軍聯袂出動，連日向突尼西亞的蓬角，菲力浦維爾，阿爾及耳睹港强　，尤以　幾天的轟炸東非。斯唐，飛行達五千公里之遠，正足以證明轟炸美國本土的可能性。一面另用驅逐機邀羣前來空襲義國本士的敵機，平均每日擊墜十架，表示了義國之堅强的對抗姿態。在海空軍協力下，確固地保持了西西里海峽的制　權，空軍從撒丁島西西里島的無數航空基　出發，日夜監視着西四里海峽。</p>
<p>義國海軍自此次大戰勃發以來，除巡洋艦蒙受若干損害外，他如戰艦及輕艦蜓依然完整如初，一九四〇年在泰隆特軍港被英機襲擊的二戰艦，現已完全修復，參加戰軍。所謂了本土防衛艦隊　　實力，實較敵人爲優。</p>
<p>英國提督孟司泰卿最近在標準晚報Evening　Standard）上說。</p>
<p>『反軸心軍在北非的勝利，不能保證就是地中海的制壓。」</p>
<p>義國自採取所謂戰綫集的的戰略後，海空軍威力的昻揚，更見充實了。</p>
<p>至於陸軍方面，在北非戰中雖　受若千損失，但現在義國本土鳥阿爾巴尼亞，希臘，巴爾幹方面加上了義勇軍尙有〇〇萬。這些在本土及希臘方面的軍隊，爲準備英美的侵入大陸，目前正在銳意實施充實及加强裝備。戰車自動車之類急遽地增强起來，僅義國沿岸阞備的大砲即已達〇〇門。</p>
<p>這許多兵器，當然全部在義國製造，現在的軍需工業，因空襲，運輸力等種種關係，除小工塲被迫有若千變化外，大工塲均全部開工，從德國方面來的鋼鐵及其他材料的供給，亦頗順利，沒有因物資不足而停止運轉的狀態。飛機也在這許多工塲中製造，驅逐機及夜問戰鬥機管最爲急需，故正在大量增產。新型轟炸機最近亦見出現。總之，一般軍需工業的操作及軍隊的裝備，並無不安，突尼西亞戰後，並且迅速地在擴張强化中。</p>
<p>其决，英美所視爲謀略宣傳之中心的義國人民的意志如何呢？義國人民之精神基礎的法西斯主義，及戰爭指導之根幹的法西斯政權，不管英美方面的種種宜傳加以中傷，愈見强固。今日各國爲遂行戰爭，或多或少的採用全體主義的或法西主義的經濟統制與國民組織。宣傳「義同人民和法西政權背離」的英美本身，對民主主義因此次大戰而消逝，將獨裁的政治形態的這一事實，又將怎樣解釋呢？這種宣傳的毫無根據，雖三歲小兒，也很明白。</p>
<p>法西斯主義較歷時十年的羅斯福政權有更悠久的歷史與基礎。而且勞動者，農民，軍隊就是糨的本體。關於此點，試舉一例以明英國的宣似是怎樣的愚蠢英國最近宣傳說：「法西黨員在本年度較去年度大爲减少。」然而事實上去年度的調查是十二個月之間的數目，而本年度則僅四個月間的調查數目，在農忙期間，大多數的農民尙未完畢改換黨員證的手續。義國農民對這宣傳　一笑置之。</p>
<p>總之，義國在墨索里尼首相領導之下是絕對不落後的，完全履行了軸心之一支柱的重要任務。翔：　自六月四日讀　報知）</p>
<p>（沮利希田口特派員四日特電）季祿，特戈爾會見的結果，北非新設的『法國民族解放委員會』四日在阿爾及爾召開第一次會議，討論法國西非總督蒲伊森，西非大西洋岸法國艦隊司令官米蘇里哀等的罷免問題，歷時頗久。特戈爾方面計劃使本派的羅奇恩齊洛姆，達爾太二人塡補上述委員會中的二名缺額。結果如何，　未判明。此次「法國民族解放委員會」的設立，據一部份中立人士的觀測，季祿，特戈爾二人已成立諒解，互相担任該會的委員長。英英首關部把法國叛黨的政治指導權交與特戈爾，一面把軍事的實權則委之季祿。羅斯福和邱吉爾懇談的結果，戰後法國的復興，雖想利用季祿一派的勞力，但現在所成爲問題者，對蘇聯尙有所顧忌，中特戈爾亦不能棄之不顧，故至少在目前尙擬施行兩頭政治。</p>
<p>大家都知道特戈爾本身不是一個進步分子。環繞於他四周的人們，有穩健派，自由主義者，甚至有共產黨等極左派。據納居奈爾，　增格報所傳，特戈爾不僅是原來的法國人民戰綫派，即現在仍繼續秘密運動，與法國共產黨保持密切的聯繫。至於季祿則受法屬北非的資本家及官僚的指揮，和特戈爾一派自然有不相容的關係。雖然如此，但法國叛黨仍實施二頭政治者，除上述政治的理由外，另有軍事上的必要。</p>
<p>爲遂行對軸心的戰爭，必須綱羅法國的一切分子。關於此點應予注意者，原法國軍團長喬治即所謂「喬治案』之提議者的被任命爲該會委員之一。這「喬治案」即係以法國基地攻略義國本土的計劃。此案是否在反軸心國的歐洲登陸作戰的　序之內，另作別論，但像他這樣的積極論者之被選　爲　儡政府的一員，不　就是說明反軸心陣營的企圖。</p>
<p>「北非法國中央執行委員會』何以不是「法國臨時政府」而依然稱爲委員會呢？中立國人士的觀測，即使羅斯福和邱吉爾也因特戈爾，季祿等缺乏法國上層階繳之實際的支持，在戰後他們的勞力將發揮至何種程度，頗懷疑問，同時又很明白在戰後無財政基礎的法國社會機構上，尤其在政治上，是怎樣的無力而又係臨時的性質。故將來縱使想利用季祿的勞力，但現在的問題，沒有領土的傀儡政權，究竟是變態的形式。委員會的名稱，就因十二分的諒解這內情而來。</p>
<p>更據情報所傳，特戈爾對此次委員會的設立，曾因季祿所提『完全的合體』一案而引起了紛爭。上述情形，暗示二派此次的合流不過是部分的「諒解』的程度而已。（翔：譯自六月六日西部朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>關於陸亨明自殺事　警務當局談話</h3>
<p>警務當局對陸亨明服毒自殺事發表談話云「關於靜安寺署警察官與陸亨明一案，爲避免外界誤會起見，警務當局茲發表眞相如后：本事件發生於六月六日，在福煦路慕爾鳴路口正章乾洗商店，該店店主朱決明，在職員十二人中辭去六人，並將六人市民證扣留，此實爲該事故之重大原因，故此事件乃爲陸亨明與店主之私人之爭執事，在事件發生時，靜安寺署警察官正値落差時，且正在正章商店中，故彼於此時乃施行調解，實未參與此事件，在騐屍結果，是發現屍體二手有微傷，此乃陸與店主互相爭執時所致，且此微傷，並非爲致死原因，陸因受屈，心中不服，乃服毒自殺云。』</p>
<h3>聞蘭亭先生　響應節宴公約</h3>
<p>自本報倡議「節省宴會公約後，各界紛紛來函響函云：「本人對於節省宴會事，實行已久，不過僅就個人與家庭問行之，初未有普及社會之念。今貴報廣爲提倡，則處此生活程度之下，誰不願遵守此公約，本人首先贊成參加。希望社會人士，對此公的信守不渝，以挽頽風」等語。洵足爲社會模範</p>

<h3>徐匯助學金足球　華混勝猶太　比數二對零</h3>
<p>徐匯中學主辦之助學金足球義賽，第一砲上海北征軍戰猶太，於昨日下午五時一刻，在該校交鋒。壁上觀者達五千人，盛况空前。華混隊發揮至上威力，以二對〇全勝猶太，裁判何春暉，開球由謝筱初安人主持，賽至中途拍賣義球，經劇烈競購後，終由謝筱初夫人以二萬五千元高價成交。賽畢，由該校校董季志堯致謝詞。昨賽個人技術，華混除賈幼良李義臣張林根表演精彩外，小將李垚亦有佳構頗博好評，猶太沙曼·曼亞兩後衛演出優良。上半時李義臣在廿五碼左右，遙射命中。休息時後，小將李垚得賈幼良之球，又射中。時間吿終，華混以二對〇勝猶太。聞義賽第二戰定十四日（下週一）由華混出戰葡萄牙昨日本報發報時間六點四十分</p>

<h3>關於急賬的建議</h3>
<p>我們昨天接到兩位靑年對於華北急賑的建議。覺得頗有見地：</p>
<p>（一）將來賑物到達災區後，如何分配，始能合情合理，平均　惠，則事先應有充分準備，凡調查災區面積，人口，災况等等，由各該當地機關與地方公正人士供給資料，作爲分配之依據。</p>
<p>（二）上海及鄰縣之荳腐店頗多，其豆製品剩餘之渣滓（即荳渣），可以製成乾餅，以充災民食料，價廉量多，値得收購。</p>
<p>第一點雖屬日後之事，但爲最後的最重要的一步，如能事先成竹在胸，不致臨事張皇，確是値得重視的一點，盼望急賑機關推動此一工作。第二點，是具體辦法，希望急賑會予以考慮，並盼對此問題熟悉的，或於收購製餅方面技術上如有高見，請逕與急賑會通信商洽，以期凡屬有利於災民的事，都能成事實。</p>
<p>此外，各界如見到類似上述第二點的切實辦法，不妨提出建議。</p>
<p>經濟界　小言論</p>
<h3>商業統制在自治精神</h3>
<p>全國商業統制總會成立之初，固曾揭藥「公正廉明」四字，爲從事工作人員勗。何謂公？犧牲小我之利益，完成大衆之福利，不徇私，不便己。何謂正？肅淸利用機會以便私團之敗類，甄拔直言敢陳不何腴不偏見之人才，硬幹實幹，無通融之餘地。何謂廉，不妄取一分，不假公濟私，先人後己，猥介自持。何謂明？藏納於會社之不良分子，務必廓淸，用手腕勞力以混跡之不良人員，務必屛除。茍能明此四者，始可實現「商業集體自治統制」之精神。須知公正廉明，不是片面的，或僅僅少數人的，要集體的，整個的。倘辦商統事務中有一人作弊犯奸，即常用嚴刑峻法，予以最嚴重之法律制裁。尤其是下層的各公會分子，嚴防假借名義勢力，以遂其營私舞弊，欺妄商民者。就肥者所知，巳覺有此中不免之憂，負商統會全責者，實應早早覺察，急籌防維之策；官廳協助，社會監督，亦萬萬不可弛懈？倘僅此自治精神都做不到，則一着之錯，全盤皆非；此後宵小僉壬，假此美名，作惡爲非，以利便其私業，攫取其私利者，恐將接踵而起。思之驚悸，重思之更覺汗流浹背。賢明之商統會常局，淸夜捫心，宜如何戒懍恐懼，黽勉同僚，勗勵各級公會同人，以無負此「商業集體自治統制」之精神！</p>
<h3>各行荘繳解　活存凖備金辦法　公債糧券作六成繳納</h3>
<p>銀錢業各行莊爲保障存款人利益，依法繳解存款準備金，由中央儲備銀行開立準備金戶帳，關於定期存款及特種活期存款準備金百分之五早已繳解，活期存款準備金百分之十，經通融分二次繳解。其第二次應繳之準備金頃已於六月起分別緻解。茲錄其繳解辦法如下：</p>
<p>（一）各行莊應繳活期存款第二次百分之五準備金，准予通融展期二個月，延緩至六月一日起，根據五月三十一日計表所列活期存款金額，再行核定繼續繳存。（二）中儲活期存款利息爲週息一厘，同業存款利息爲週息二厘，各行莊存款準備金利息增至三厘，已較一般存款利息爲高，且活期存款準備金依照檢查處規定，得暫以地產金條安定公債或糧食庫券等六成作爲代用品繳納。（三）查往來透支科目一項，但確屬活期存款性質，且檢查處並非逐日核算準備金，係按月末日之月計表核定繳存，例如某甲於某月一日繳存一百萬元，至十二九日交出，檢查處即不核繳準備金，故以一戶而論，存欠金額之變更自屬難免，但以全數而論當無多大出人，事關通案未便將往來透支科目剔除計算，應予照章繳納存款準備金。（四）活期存款準備金繳納一部份代用品，係屬臨時通融辦法，定期及特種活期存款準備金，未便援以爲例，應按照核定金額一律以現金繳納。</p>
<h3>中儲供給同業拆放　仍由銀聯會辦理　額以四萬萬元爲限</h3>
<p>銀聯會票據交換差額淸算事務，由中儲接辦後，同業拆放事宜，仍由銀聯會繼續辦理，並由中儲供給拆放資金，以四萬萬元爲限，惟具體辦法正在磋商之中。大的依照三月二十四日修改之新辦法辦理，拆放行莊以下列各行莊爲限：（一）上海市銀行業同業公會會員銀行。（二）上海市錢業同業公會會員錢莊。（三）準備會往來各行莊。凡由請拆放者必須提供担保品，如政府證劵華商股票房地產貨物等，準備會對每一行莊之拆放總額，由拆放委會議定。但不得超過各該行莊之實收資本及公積金之合計數，依照評定價格折扣辦理，期限以十日爲限，利率由銀聯會隨時訂定之。</p>
<h3>糧食部修正　漁業建徵處規程</h3>
<p>糧食部水產管理局，前爲建設水產事業起見，經轉呈奉行政院核准恢復征收漁業建設費，並按原定率百分之二成半征收，分於本年一月一成立漁業建設費徵收處，專責管理，啓征以來，收數尙旺，查該處組織規程，本係呈奉實業部核准施行在案，茲悉糧食部當局以該局業經變更隸屬關係，該處組織規程，自應加以修正，並予公布施行，以明系統。故該部業已抄發修正木令，飭該局知照，並轉飭該漁業建設費稽征處，自公佈日起遵照施行。</p>
<h3>糧食部籌建　各地儲糧倉庫</h3>
<p>國民政府爲收購米糧建築儲糧倉庫，發行民國三十一年甲乙兩種糧食庫券，總共國幣五萬萬元後，已由中央儲備銀行全部承受，並由銀錢業各行莊轉向中儲行分認，頃聞糧食部鑒於收購糧食及建倉資金已有的款，除實施統一收購集中配給外，並決定於各省市適常地點設立倉庫，以求米穀之妥善貯藏，合於科學原則。儲倉地點爲南京·鎭江·丹陽·揚州·高郵·竇應·氾水·泰州·東台·興化·姜堰·蘇州·常州無錫·常熟·崑山·松江·嘉興·杭州·湖州·蕪湖·當塗·安慶·等處。</p>
<h3>市經濟局繼續　調查華股業商</h3>
<p>本市各華股業商，經市經濟局審查合格，頒發執照營業者，計有三下五家。其餘各商，已向該局申請註冊，尚未核准者，據悉仍由該局派員繼續密查。並悉該局爲愼重起見，除所派人員，均仍由該局塡發出勤證外並飭各員於調查前，須先將出勤證交各商查閱，以資證實。如未持有該項出勤證者，顯係不法之徒，冀圖敲詐，深盼各商切實注意。如有此項情事，可立即報吿該局轉知警政當局嚴辦，幸勿受愚。</p>
<h3>華股趨勢</h3>
<p>昨華股穩定，新老投資者在銀根日聚聲中活動收吸，不遺餘力，然爲求現之一部份賣戶所抑制，各股此起彼落，升降不一，均在狹小範國中徘徊。照各方人心雖仍恍忽，最後脚地已帶堅硬。百貨業之永安公司仍在贈股消息中微挺，新新小挫，國貨略升，均僅元餘仲縮。中國內衣與量福衫襪堅定原價。紡織業最爲堅挺；永安紗廠，美亞綢廠，新豐印染等均不乏買戶在進展中。新藥業已趨呆定，中法當日僅數角起伏，新亞堅持在大關左右，中西藥房續見做高，信誼藥廠成交價略低。文化業商務書館呆平，中華與世界書局均稍削落。南洋烟公司與大中華火柴供過於求，再度低落。公用業之閘北水電略昂，華商電氣仍在疲風中，各雜股如通易信託，久安實業，新益地產，中興木業等升降均微。新股德豐針織經某戶之吸收，驟爲提升元餘，金融業股買賣皆稀，食品股則告堅穩。</p>

<h3>青春的活力</h3>
<p>— 泓英</p>
<p>靑年有蓬勃的朝氣，有活躍的心靈，有熱烈的情緒，靑年更有雄心，理想慷　……所以　靑年時代是人生最美麗的時代。</p>
<p>靑年是富於進取性與創造性的；往往有許多靑年，因一時情感的衝動，與好奇心的驅使，就勇敢緊毅地向前進取。也有靑年爲要實現其理想起見。不顧一　　在困難和矛盾的境况中，用自己的力，熱，血來推動一切，使生活不斷的向新的境界進展。此種勢力創造的現象。是一般靑年們的特徵。</p>
<p>我們請偉人的傳記，得知他們眞正的生命，是始於靑年時代的。靑年時代的他們，除了刻苦地　求知識，以滿足其求知慾外，他們的思想，常因外界的影饗而改變。他們的生活也因環境的支配而轉移，他們有一個特點，就是永遠不滿足現實的生活，而一刻不停地努力創造、他們憑着理智，發揮着才能，利用着年靑的活力，致力於自己所認爲最有價値的工作，而希望自己的生活能臻於美善的境界。因此，他們獲得了的個充實的人生，在他們的生命中，留下了許多慷慨激烈，可歌可泣一偉大事蹟。</p>
<p>德國大哲學家事德說：『我等欲爲大業，必在靑年』這是一句極有價値的話。靑年有着許多天賦的優越條件，像日中之光一樣，充滿着『靑春』氣息；『生的活力』使我們勇於工作。年靑的朋友們，你不是感到生命的虛空麽？你不是有着美麗的憧憬麽；我忠吿你，請你記牢康德的話，不要畏縮，不要躇鑄，你必抓住現實，利用靑春，辛苦地工作一番，來創造你的事業，創造你的新生命！</p>
<h3>孩子們的苦悶</h3>
<p>— 參軍</p>
<p>孩子們是國家未來的主人翁，然而現在這些朱來的主人翁正遭遇着兇險的厄運！</p>
<p>在這動盪的時代環境的轉變，生活的艱難，支持家庭跟培植子女的重責，是當前每一個父母所感到最嚴重的問題，掙扎在生命綫之下的父母們就慢慢地變成瘦弱，衰老了。由於環境的惡劣跟生活的爲難，所以這些未來的主人翁就產生了種種的悲劇。</p>
<p>一。在苦悶，拮据的境遇中生活着的父母們。時常有煩惱和怨根侵襲他們，而無辜的孩子們就是唯一發洩的工具，這給予孩子們是一個很大的剌激。所以漸漸地被剝奪了天眞活潑的心靈而養成一種畏怯着弱的性情。</p>
<p>二·因爲父母們受了經濟的逼迫，對於子女的求學問題就很難負担，因此孩子們就很少能受相當完全的敎育，而知識程度與文化的水準也就無形降低，生長在這種環境中的孩子，雖有很好的天才，也難發展，所以時時作低聲的哀求，希望着得力的救助</p>
<p>三·因日常飲食的簡苦。營養的不良，以至影響身體的康”與發育的不全；加以窮困無能的父母，價格高昻的藥品，所以常病　蹂躪到孩子們的身上時，就任其橫行，在短短的時期中，就殺害了他們弱小的生命。</p>
<p>四·有許多孩子們，已在替他們的父母助一臂之力，靠着地們微小的力量而獲得此微的收入，然而孩子們的力量有限，往往因操勞過度而精疲力竭，呻吟於病榻；或竟致一病不起。再說有被生活的鞭策，而通着生馬似的生活，在兇暴咒　的待遇下無抬頭的日子，又有被生計所迫或舉目無親的孤兒。流浪街頭，受別人的利用面幹着不正常的勾當一面受孤劣環增的誘惑而喪失意志和人格的墮落，這樣影響社會國家的進化，也許更影響社會的治安和國家的前途。</p>
<p>雖然有許多孩子是無凍餒之患，處富裕的環境，過安適的生活，但是處高貴地位的孩子們未必都成大器，而居低賤階級的孩子們未必都是些不成器的東西。因爲他們所受的教訓是刻苦自勵、勤儉耐勞，以環境的教訓，以困苦的境還漸漸地磨練，所以他們的才能也許比較高　些。因此拯救這些貧苦的孩子們是當今嚴重的問題，我們努力灌漑這些將被摧殘了的小生命，使他們更生，發棄·而結　大的果。</p>

<h3>「茶花女」上演前奏</h3>
<p>— 逸泉</p>
<p>演出：六月十二日至十五日下午五時</p>
<p>地點：蘭心大戲院</p>
<p>『茶花女』歌劇終於在中國歌劇公司管理下。將於十二日演出了。凡是關心中國對西洋音樂發展的人，不能不加以注意吧。</p>
<p>「中國歌劇公司』這是由羅鏡偉伍正謙汪菊潭三位先生組織的，他們原望聘請中國人來演出意大利歌劇，造成中國西洋音樂史上的新的一頁，然而這次因爲種種困難與事實上的不可能，祇好借用少數外人。</p>
<p>我想信每一位學唱的人，他的最大的目標，就是能演唱歌劇，在上海國人方面擁有多量的歌唱家，然而因爲素來沒有組織，所以從沒有機會給他們一展所長，中國歌劇公司的主旨，就是提倡歌劇，能使每個歌唱家能有演出的機會。</p>
<p>歌劇的發源地是義大利，最發達的國家也是義大利，『茶花女」作曲者浮第是義大利最出名的默劇作家之一。義大利的樂風輕鬆受妙，詩意洋溢，至於「茶花女」的故事，早爲國人所稔知，其情節之　感頑麗，亦最爲適合國人性情，因爲以上種種條件就成爲中國歌劇公司的處女演出演員方面，其陣容雖不能說十分滿意然而已盡了最大的努力了。</p>

<h3>從滿洲到上海（一）</h3>
<p>— 橋本關雪</p>
<p>在朝　　鐵道的列車中，聽對面坐着的人說起到承德有火車可通，立即變更直接到北京的行程，中途在錦州下車。從錦州繞道承德經古北口而至北京的這條路綫、事變後方纔開通，我本來正要想觀光熱河，聽說從錦州起須得乘卡車在凹凸不平的道路上顚簸二三天，爲之興趣索然，現在有火車可通，那眞便利不少了。</p>
<p>在錦州站下車，我因人地生疏，就預備到車站上的旅行社所指定的某放館去，可是走出車站</p>
<p>覓輛洋車，天快黑下來了。我穿着皮底草鞋，兩手提　不十分重的手提皮包，走上步履維艱的砂粒路。到得旅樓中，幾被拒絕，好容易才走上二變的房間。此次我所得到的待遇似乎變了。我到滿洲來已不下數十次。每决都有値得留戀的地方，可是從過去到現在，一點也未曾有所變更的。是一種殖民地風氣，似浮萍般飄蕩無根的不誠實。在朝鮮到處可見堅定而安靜的姿態，但在滿洲却一切都好像沒有生根一般的不安定。這在我們從本國出外旅行的人看來，似是一種遺憾。</p>
<p>錦州所感到的印象，恰似陳舊的倉庫中塞滿了破棉絮。近車站的地方，雖然有近代的建築裝飾着，但毫無彈力性，觸目是一副頽廢的景象。</p>
<p>一早到承德，走出車站降着一陣沙雨。　着和服，脚下踏着皮底草鞋，極感不便。本來以爲預定寄宿的處所本有車來接，　是不見，依着同車旅伴的指示：打電話到宿所去詢問，因說房間已客滿了，容不下了。那人四面留意，在車站的階上聽人說起本地有旅館，恰似久旱逢大雨不勝欣喜，就在這裏卸下了行李。</p>
<p>車站前的空塲，聚集着滿洲兵和若干日本軍人。馬上負荷着許多食糧和兵器，到旅館裏一卸下行李，即幹自己的正事。那時候，先前所感到的不快，一齊氷消霧散，胸境爲之一暢。</p>
<p>熱河的離宮，並不如想像中那樣的程度，不過比奉天的北陵似乎淸雅些。喇嘛寺即所謂熱河八廟者，規模相當宏大。在華中難得見到。蒼虬的老松，隨地皆是，倍增情趣。</p>
<p>雨中在普　寺的門口，向路傍的小販買鷄蛋數枚與車夫分而食之，一面再細細地玩賞四周的風物，我的印象中，充滿了戰時風景的景象。</p>
<p>我以爲車站旅館中一定是很嘈雜的，那知因列車出入的班决甚少，不大聽見汽笛聲。比止宿於混雜而不安靜的旅店，精神不知要好上多少。這裏滿洲人的服侍，也比較親切，那夜酣暢地安眠了一宿。</p>
<p>從承德到古北口，在我尙是第一遭。圍繞着赭斑剥落的土牆的集團部落，隨地可見。雪溶後楊柳的嫩芽，搖曳着柔和的綠色，問有　着似雪般白花的梨樹，雖有鐵剌綱，沙袋等東四混雜其間，但決不感到有殺伐之象。眞是一幅極好的畫圖，和以前中國旅行的印象，另有一種異標的感興，尤以山間的小站，被〇〇掩蔽着，小羊遊散於其問，這種種風景都是前所未見的。我頗想中途下車寫生，因是要塞地帶。列車也祇一日經過一次，亦無可供停宿的外所，故而祗能作罷。聽說此地是共匪出沒之處，幸而持有許可證，出示車中憲兵，利用暫時停車的時間，留下了暗號式的速寫，想等將來記起的時候執筆。</p>
<p>古北口的萬里長城一向是有名的。在眺長城的各種景色上，雖很便利，但在作畫上，襯托的景緻不夠，有必須省略者。我以爲從居庸關到八達嶺這一段景色，因多山峽，比此地好得多，</p>
<p>車中同室的有目稱爲京都人者、在蒙疆釀造葡萄酒，對我說，「想送酒到你的寓所」。不通名而別。到達北京後，果然有人送來了二　葡萄酒，看所附的名剌。知是櫻井君。</p>
<p>蒙疆的葡萄古巳有名。少年時有一首愛誦的詩是：『葡萄美酒鬱金杯，馬上琵琶月下催。」想到「古來征戰幾人同」這一句結句時，一面吟味着往古的遠征和現代的戰爭，一面欣賞美酒的滋味。（翔譯自西部每日新聞）</p>

<h3>Hoping Wealthy Classes Will Voluntarily Donate</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the Shanghai All Circles North China Relief Association, fundraising efforts have been underway in various ways. We have repeatedly stated before that disaster relief is like fighting a fire, and everything must be handled quickly and efficiently. It is said that the authorities of the Relief Association also attach great importance to this point and have reversed the bureaucratic habits of circuitousness and formality, which is gratifying. We believe that if this style can be carried through to the end, the North China disaster victims will directly benefit. On the other hand, people from all walks of life will have confidence in this kind of disaster relief, and they will be willing to donate more, thereby enriching the amount of donations, strengthening the power of relief, and saving more North China disaster victims, which is also expected.</p>
<p>We once agreed with Mr. Lin Kanghou's suggestion that if we wait until the donations are fully collected before purchasing relief supplies and distributing them, it will be too slow to meet the urgent need. We must first borrow funds from the national bank and then gradually repay the loans with the donations received. This method seems to be feasible in terms of both reason and emotion. Because the national bank is established by the government, and it is the government's responsibility to provide relief to disaster victims. Mr. Lin Kanghou is now one of the actual persons in charge of the Relief Association, so we believe that Mr. Lin must be doing his best to promote the realization of his suggestion!</p>
<p>However, although we suggest that the bank provide loans, the loans must be repaid after all. Therefore, how to step up fundraising is still the most important issue. Whether it is to repay loans or directly purchase relief supplies, we must ultimately have relief funds to use.</p>
<p>The Relief Association has already set a plan for fundraising and is implementing it accordingly. However, the essence of this plan can only be said to be "wishful thinking." In fact, it is entirely entrusted to the donors' spontaneous sympathy. If the donors' sympathy is not aroused enthusiastically, then the plan will become a dead letter, and the provisions in the plan will not be effective. This is not to say that the plan is useless, but that it is even more necessary to arouse the donors' high degree of sympathy and enthusiastic support. Only then can the plan achieve practical results. For example, the plan stipulates to hold a charity ball game, and the tickets are sold particularly high than usual. We hope that those who have the strength and enjoy ball games will first initiate the psychology of sympathizing with the disaster victims, regardless of whether the ticket price matches the ball game or not, and should have the generous spirit of "donating even if there is no ball game to watch," and regard watching the ball game as "extra income." With such a mentality supporting this charity game, participation will be enthusiastic, income will increase, and the plan will achieve practical results.</p>
<p>Today, we sincerely represent the North China disaster victims in expressing our most sincere hopes to the citizens of the whole city—especially the ladies of the wealthy class—for the highest degree of spontaneous sympathy, generous donations, and active support. Please pay donations at the designated nearby banks and money houses of the Relief Association. The more the better, the continuous stream. We have carefully examined the past lists of donations collected on behalf of the News and this newspaper, as well as the actual situation at the time of payment. Although there are a few donations from the wealthy class, the salary and working class account for the majority. Although we dare not say that the wealthier the class, the more focused on enjoying themselves and lacking sympathy. However, the current reality is that the salary and working class have a higher degree of sympathy. Conversely, the number of wealthy class is not as large as the working class, so the number of donors is not as large as the working class. However, we want to assert that all the ladies who are happily enjoying themselves in the aristocratic dance halls, restaurants, tea rooms, hotels, theaters, and other places in Shanghai when the lights are on, are qualified for the wealthy class, and this number will definitely not be too small. We sincerely urge these ladies to spontaneously initiate the noblest sympathy of mankind, and send a portion of their expenses to the nearby disaster relief collection agencies. We believe that this amount must be more than the contribution of the salary and working public. It seems to be a drop in the bucket for the wealthy class, but the North China disaster victims will regard it as righteous grain and benevolent slurry.</p>
<p>We further offer a little opinion to the wealthy class. We have already discussed the life outlook of donating money. Donating money is a noble, supreme, and joyful act for individuals to broaden their horizons and see the interests clearly, and it is the noblest moral expression that comes from the heart and sincerity, which cannot be forced by others in the slightest. But as the saying goes, "A rich man's feast, a poor man's half-year's food." Now it is "A rich man's feast, ten disaster victims' lives." People are not made of wood or stone, how can they not be moved by their sympathy and express their highest morality? As for enjoying oneself while ten thousand people are starving and freezing, gathering a lot of money and not using it, it is unkind and unjust, and obsessed with money. How can one not broaden one's horizons, help others to help themselves, and express the act of supreme goodness and joy? In short, hoarding money is useless, only to harm oneself, or even harm one's descendants. Using it properly is not letting down the money. Gathering it and not using it is being obsessed with money. Donating what I have left over and saving people from death is using it properly, and I am also happy. Therefore, we sincerely hope that the ladies of the wealthy class in the whole city will launch the highest sympathy and generously donate, which is fortunate for the disaster victims.</p>
<p>In addition, since the North China Relief Association has been established in this city, and there is a unified leading agency, for the sake of concentrating forces, all relief affairs should be presided over by the association. For example, this newspaper's collection of donations on behalf of the association was an expedient measure before the association was established. Now that the association has designated banks and money houses to collect donations on its behalf, it should be transferred, and the collection on behalf of the association has been stopped since yesterday. It is hoped that all aspects of this city's actions to provide disaster relief to North China will not be carried out independently, merely dispersing forces. This is a step that should be taken under the same goal of providing relief to disaster victims, to concentrate power and enhance strength. It is hoped that the separate organizations that existed before the establishment of the Relief Association will promptly establish close contact with the association and proceed in unison.</p>

<h3>National Defense Conference Passes Wartime Cultural Propaganda Outline; Appoints Rong Zhen and Zhang Xueming as Military Commissioners</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency) – The Supreme National Defense Conference held its 17th meeting on the 10th to discuss various important proposals, the most important of which was the chairman's submission of the basic outline of wartime cultural propaganda policy. The case is divided into three parts: first, the guiding principles; second, the main points; and third, the implementation. The main points section is divided into seven items, and the implementation section is divided into eleven items, all of which have clear provisions for strengthening the national wartime consciousness, rebuilding Chinese culture, and reviving East Asian culture. The case will be sent to the National Government for promulgation and will be uniformly followed throughout the country as the highest standard for wartime cultural propaganda. In addition, the draft organization law of the Department of Health was also approved in principle. It will be implemented first and then submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review. In terms of personnel, Rong Zhen and Zhang Xueming were specially appointed as members of the Military Commission.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency) – Rong Zhen and Zhang Xueming, the newly appointed members of the Military Commission who were approved by the 17th Supreme National Defense Conference, are both from the old Northeast Army. According to reports, Commissioner Rong Zhen is over sixty years old and was a subordinate of General Zhang Zuolin of the Northeast Army, serving as regimental, brigade, and division commander, and even as the Chief of General Staff of the Northeast Frontier Defense Army. Lieutenant General Rong Ziheng, who recently participated in the peace movement, is his eldest son. After the incident, Mr. Rong retired to Beijing but was very concerned about national affairs. This time, being appointed to the National Government's Military Commission with the qualifications of a senior member of the Northeast Army has its significance. Mr. Zhang Xueming is the younger brother of General Zhang Xueliang and once served as a brigade commander in the Northeast Army (with the rank of major general). After the incident, he served as the garrison commander of Tianjin and was a powerful figure in the political circles of North China at that time. Mr. Zhang then went to Western countries to study military affairs. He returned to Hong Kong two months before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. At that time, Mr. Zhang had intended to participate in the peace movement. This year, he flew to Nanjing to pay his respects to the government authorities and was deeply valued by the authorities. After being appointed to the Military Commission this time, the personnel of the central military organs have been further strengthened. Although Mr. Zhang is only over forty years old, he is full of vigor and is a pure military figure.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army in Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Conducts Comprehensive Operations Last Month</h3>
<p>Shijiazhuang, 10th (Central News Agency) – A certain unit of the local Japanese army announced on the 10th that the comprehensive results of the Japanese army's May operations to mop up the Communist troops in the Jin-Cha-Ji border region (including the operations in western Hebei) and the achievements of the Chinese armed groups are as follows: (1) Comprehensive results of the Japanese army: 541 engagements, 918 Communist troops engaged in battle, 3,513 Communist troops abandoned their bodies, 2,257 were captured, the Japanese army seized 30 mortars, 1 heavy machine gun, 33 light machine guns, 1,083 rifles, 16 automatic rifles, 645 bayonets, 100 rounds of heavy machine gun ammunition, 895 rounds of light machine gun ammunition, 56,888 rounds of rifle ammunition, and destroyed 247 facilities. (2) Achievements of the battles with the Chinese armed groups: 23 engagements, 1,102 Communist troops engaged in battle, 171 Communist troops abandoned their bodies, 251 were captured, and the Communist army seized 1 mortar, 1 light machine gun, 68 rifles, 6 automatic rifles, and 75 pistols.</p>
<h3>Sightseeing Group of Japanese Reporters in Beiping Pays Respects to Chairman</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency) – The sightseeing group of Japanese reporters from Beiping visited the Central Military Academy yesterday (the 10th) morning and visited Minister Lin of the Propaganda Department, Minister Zhou of the Ministry of Finance, and Minister Mei of the Ministry of Industry in the afternoon. They also went to the Chairman's residence at 4 p.m. to pay their respects to the Chairman. It is learned that the group will take the train to Shanghai early this morning, the 11th.</p>
<h3>Severe Drought in Chongqing; Food Supplies Cause Panic</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency) – The shortage of food in various parts of Chongqing has become more acute during this lean season due to the reduction in agricultural production, the forced conscription of the army, and the drought. According to reliable sources received here, the drought in various parts of Chongqing in southern China is rare in recent years. Starving people are everywhere, and desolate scenes are everywhere, which is unbearable to witness. Due to the severe lack of rainfall in various parts of Chongqing in Guangdong and Fujian provinces in March, April, and May, it has had a huge impact on agricultural production. Therefore, Xiang Hanping, the commander-in-chief of the Chongqing (border area of Fujian, Guangdong, and Jiangxi provinces), specially issued a notice to make it possible to reclaim Nanfeng, Yihuangxia. The Jiangshuifeng and other places (all in Jiangxi Province) have 85,000 mu of cultivated land. It is reported that 50,000 disaster victims are planned to be accommodated, but the number of refugees flowing into the area has now exceeded 100,000, so food is even more insufficient. 10,500 people have now starved to death in the area, so the refugees are fleeing to peaceful areas, with thousands of people every day, but these refugees mostly starve to death on the way before reaching their destination, and the Chongqing county governments and border command do not care about their exposure. Given this situation, the food panic in Chongqing will further promote the people under its rule to admire peace.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education to Issue Primary and Secondary School Textbooks in the Autumn; Books to be Sold Immediately</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency) – Since the issuance of the state-approved primary and secondary school textbooks, schools across the country have followed them uniformly. Recently, the Ministry of Education learned from the report of the General Distribution Office of the National Textbooks for the Spring of the 32nd Year of the Republic of China that the distribution of the National Textbooks for the Spring of this year has been completed by the end of this month. As for the general management of the National Primary and Secondary School Textbooks for the Autumn of this year, the China United Publishing Co., Ltd., which was jointly established by major bookstores in the Shanghai publishing industry, is responsible for undertaking it, and it has also been submitted to the Ministry of Education for approval. Recently, a person in charge of the Ministry of Education announced that the promotion and sale of state-approved primary and secondary school textbooks in the future should be sought universally. In addition to the Ministry of Education's formulation of the state-approved primary and secondary school textbook sales regulations and ordering the China United Publishing Company to abide by them, the Ministry of Education will also separately notify the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities under its jurisdiction and send letters to the relevant agencies to assist in the promotion. Before the opening of school in the autumn of this year, the supply of state-approved primary and secondary school textbooks has been prepared early, and major bookstores across the country will soon be able to sell them simultaneously.</p>
<h3>Frontal Conflict to Occur Between Chongqing and Communist Armies in Northwest China</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) – According to a special Shanghai dispatch carried by the local Mainichi Shimbun, it has been a week since the Chinese Communist Party announced the resolution to dissolve the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government, etc., and Chongqing has remained silent, which is enough to prove the depth of its shock. Since the Chinese Communist Party severed its ties with Moscow, it has made superficial concessions to Chongqing and Chiang by abolishing the Border Region Government in order to seek self-reliance and cleverly avoid Chongqing's offensive. At the same time, it is taking the opportunity to demand that the Chinese Communist Party be granted legal status in order to resolve this long-standing issue. However, although Chongqing believes that the abolition of the Border Region Government will at least nominally expand Chongqing's political power and further strengthen the national united front, it feels that the gains do not outweigh the losses based on this proposal, so it feels very difficult. Therefore, the conflict between Chongqing and the Communist Party has been caused again by the Chinese Communist Party's actions of abandoning name and taking reality this time. The Chinese Communist Party originally borrowed the dual names of the International Communist Party branch and the Border Region Government to gain an advantageous position to suck up the people, and openly propagandize and expand its territory under the name of the national united front and patriotism. At the same time, since Chongqing wants to use the northwest as the last base for the war of resistance, it is inevitable that Chongqing and the Communist Party will compete fiercely for territory in the northwest. In addition, what is most noteworthy in this regard is that Chongqing has recently implemented the reduction of the area of each province and the increase in the number of provinces in order to allow its political power to penetrate into various localities. In addition, after the dissolution of the International Communist Party, the Chinese Communist Party's organ newspaper Xinhua Daily once commented: "The Chinese Communist Party will continue to exist regardless of whether the International Communist Party exists or not. Because the current Central Government has made leaps and bounds in all aspects of party politics and military affairs that are more than five times greater than when it was established, the Chinese Communist Party must still strive to expand and strengthen after the dissolution of the International Communist Party," and so on. Judging from this, it can be concluded that Chongqing and the Communist Party will inevitably have a frontal conflict in the northwest. In addition, the Chinese Communist Party attempted to realize the state of the Wuhan government during the first cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in this proposal, and demanded that Chongqing recognize the Chinese Communist Party as a legal party, so that Chinese Communist Party members and Chongqing party members have the same qualifications to participate in politics, and the Chinese Communist Party headquarters can enter and exit Chongqing. However, Chongqing feels very uneasy about this. And this time, the Chinese Communist Party admitted that it would place the Communist army under the command of the Chongqing Military Commission, and demanded that the Chinese Communist Party be allowed to retain the actual command of the Communist army and be paid all military expenses. However, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese Incident, the Communist army has nominally been reorganized into the Eighteenth Group Army, but in reality, it is still entirely commanded by the Chinese Communist Party itself, so its demands this time are obviously still the same as before, only in form, and its intention is actually to erase the New Fourth Army Incident in January of the year before last and attempt to rebuild the New Fourth Army. As for the issue of military expenses, the military expenses currently paid by Chongqing for the tens of thousands of Communist troops nominally under the Chongqing Military Commission are extremely small. Because Chongqing still feels that the military expenses for the direct troops are insufficient, it is even more powerless to take care of the Communist army, so the situation in which the Chongqing and Communist armies compete for territory in order to be self-sufficient will inevitably become more and more intense.</p>
<p>Yujing, 10th (Central News Agency) – Although Chongqing and the Communist Party are nominally cooperating now, they are still mutually rubbing and fighting in the dark. Since April 1938, until recently, there have been more than 100 large and small such infighting incidents. Recently, Chongqing's offensive against the Communist Party has become increasingly active, and the mutual infighting between the two sides will become more intense. The reasons are: (1) Recently, Chongqing intends to resolve the Communist Party issue purely as an internal issue. This tendency has become more obvious since the dissolution of the International Communist Party some time ago. (2) Due to military failures and the hardship of the people's lives, Chongqing is actively focusing on cultivating combat power in order to recover the depressed morale of the people. Therefore, it is strictly forbidding the armed factions to make trouble internally. (3) Chongqing's attitude towards the Communist Party is that although it recognizes the status of the Communist Party after the dissolution of the International Communist regime, it does not recognize any armed groups other than the Chongqing army. Therefore, the Communist army, which attempts to invade the Chongqing army's territory, is of course dissatisfied with being restricted under this coercion.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Formulate Concrete Measures for Receiving French Concession in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency) – Our government has successfully completed the reception of the French-administered concessions in Tianjin, Hankou, and Guangzhou. The issue of receiving the French Concession in Shanghai will begin soon. Yesterday afternoon, Minister of Foreign Affairs Chu Minyi specially invited Receiver Xia Qifeng, the Minister of Auditing, to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to discuss the direction of the proceedings. It is learned that concrete measures have been formulated and will be actively negotiated with the French side in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Comprehensive Results of Japanese Air Force in South Pacific; Destroyed Over 200 Enemy Aircraft in Three Months</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) – The decisive battle between the Japanese and American air forces in the South Pacific is becoming more and more intense. Although the enemy aircraft stubbornly attempted to counterattack, the Japanese army and navy air force units actively bombed the enemy's forward bases after advancing to Guadalcanal Island, and severely damaged the attacking enemy aircraft. The Japanese army and navy ground forces also severely damaged the enemy aircraft that came to air raid day and night in close connection with the air force units. The Japanese army's war results announced by the Japanese headquarters today: a total of 249 enemy aircraft were shot down and destroyed independently by Japanese anti-aircraft artillery fire in the three months from March to May. This is enough to prove the strength of the Japanese army's anti-aircraft guns and other anti-aircraft fire, which has obviously improved compared to before the war. Therefore, the enemy air force does not dare to enter the power circle of the Japanese high-altitude guns and only hovers in the vicinity of its periphery. This also shows that the enemy's power has been weakened. In addition, the captured enemy air force personnel were all deeply amazed by the power of the Japanese army's anti-aircraft guns, which clearly shows that the enemy has been threatened by the Japanese ground anti-aircraft weapons. In addition, the number of times enemy aircraft raided New Guinea Island and the Solomon Islands in the South Pacific has reached 1,600 per month since February. However, the Japanese army front-line soldiers calmly dealt with them and maneuvered with them, often overcoming all difficulties and grasping the anti-aircraft situation, so they were able to obtain this great war result. This is the gift of the Japanese army's unyielding fighting spirit, and the enemy aircraft avoided the day raids and used the night due to excessive damage. However, because the Japanese army's anti-aircraft artillery fire is extremely accurate, the enemy army often dropped bombs from high altitude and then fled in a hurry. Occasionally, there were brave enemy aircraft that turned their noses to Japan and fired machine guns on the ground after seeing that the situation was favorable. Therefore, the Japanese ground anti-aircraft units never slackened for a moment and were very accurate and rapid in their air strikes, so the enemy aircraft immediately fled. The main types of enemy aircraft shot down and destroyed by the Japanese army ground anti-aircraft units include the Giant P38, P39, P40, and Asa bombers, which are the latest fighters and bombers boasted by the enemy.</p>
<h3>Reshuffle of Japanese Army Officials</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) – Lieutenant General Tadashi Sano, who had outstanding military exploits during the Hong Kong operation, and later made immortal feats on the southern front, was suddenly appointed as the Chief of Staff of the Eastern Defense Headquarters after Lieutenant General Asasaburo Kobayashi. In addition, Lieutenant General Tadamichi Kuribayashi, the Chief of Staff of the troops in China, has now been appointed as the Commander of the Tokyo Division. In addition, Lieutenant General Shizuo Sakaguchi, who was famous in the Java Capture Operation, has now been appointed as the Commander of the Zentsuji Division. The above three lieutenant generals and seven major generals including Katsuzo Matsuoka have been transferred. The Japanese Ministry of the Army announced this on the 10th.</p>
<h3>Lieutenant General Iwao Sodeshiro Sacrifices His Life for the Country in Burma</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) – Lieutenant General Iwao Sodeshiro of the Japanese Army died in battle near Burma and Thailand on January 26 at the age of 52. He graduated from the Army University in the 14th year of Taisho (1925), served as a staff officer of the Nagoya Division in the 9th year of Showa (1934), promoted to Colonel in March of the 13th year of Showa (1938), promoted to Major General in March of the 16th year of Showa (1941), and served as the commander of the stationed Manchurian troops, and in September of the 17th year of Showa (1942), he served as the commander of the first-line troops in the South.</p>
<h3>Tokyo Metropolitan System Bill Passes Japanese Cabinet Meeting</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) – The Tokyo Metropolitan System Bill passed the Japanese Cabinet meeting on May 11 and will be implemented from July 1. From then on, Tokyo will be free from the disadvantages of the double administrative structure of the government and the city. Recently, the Privy Council has been carefully deliberating on the essential outline of its official system, and the final decision was made at the Privy Council meeting on the 9th. According to the essential outline of the official system, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government has a grand structure that is not weaker than the central provinces, so it was decided that the head of the metropolitan government would be specially appointed, and there would be one assistant administrator of a simplified rank below him, who would be the highest assistant official of the metropolitan government. In addition to the chief officer's office in the metropolitan area, there are eight bureaus: Civil Affairs, Education, Economy, Planning, Defense, Transportation, Water Supply, and Port. The directors of each bureau are all of simplified rank, which is much simpler than the current Tokyo city agency (mayor's office with nine bureaus and two departments).</p>
<h3>Burmese Inspection Group Arrives in Japan</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) – After the Burmese autonomous government official Ba Maw and others visited Japan, the country is actively moving towards the path of independence. Since the establishment of the Independence Preparatory Committee on May 8, each department has actively carried out various preparations for independence. Recently, the core members of the Burmese government's political parties, youth movements, and industrial relations decided to send an inspection group to visit Japan in order to understand the situation in Japan and contribute to the establishment of a new Burma. The group is headed by U Ni, with a total of 28 members. The group arrived in Moji at 3:30 pm on the 10th and is scheduled to arrive in Tokyo on the 12th of this month for a one-week stay to conduct a detailed study of Japan's administrative, police, industrial, educational, cultural, and other aspects under the decisive battle system. After personally experiencing the reality of wartime Japan, they will strengthen their determination to build a new Burma.</p>
<h3>Comparison of Wartime Manpower Between Axis and Anti-Axis Powers</h3>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency) – According to German news agency reports, the German Labor Minister declared to foreign reporters yesterday that the manpower on the Allied side has decreased by a quarter, while the manpower on the Axis side has increased sixfold. The current ratio of manpower between the Axis and Allied powers is 9 to 11, that is, 850 million people are on the Axis side, and 1.1 billion people are on the Allied side. Mr. Smith continued that during the First World War, the population on both sides was 136 million and 141.1 million, that is, a ratio of 1 to 10. The sixfold increase in manpower on the Axis side this time includes Japan. Even in Europe, the manpower on the Axis side has increased by two and a half times. From another perspective, there are 72 people living on every square kilometer in Axis Europe, while there are only 7 people in the United States and only 1.3 people in Australia. In this way, the people of Axis Europe and East Asia must still fight for survival. This natural training, coupled with intensive learning, and what is more, the Axis side also has excellent experience in technology. Mr. Smith declared in his conclusion that Germany's fixed labor force is due to the health of the German people.</p>
<h3>US Envoy to India Meets with Roosevelt</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency) – According to Washington sources, President Roosevelt's envoy to India, Phillips, had lunch at the White House yesterday and met with the President. Mr. Phillips returned to Washington from New Delhi a few weeks ago to report to the President on the situation in India.</p>
<h3>The Path of Sino-Japanese Economic Cooperation (3)</h3>
<p>— Juichi Tsushima</p>
<p>Currently, there is no one in the Chinese government or among the people who is not grateful for Japan's new policy of strengthening the political power of the National Government, reforming administrative institutions, and promoting economic measures. Everything is progressing. The autonomous activities of Chinese civilian economists and a system to assist government policies are gradually being established. Even the Political Affairs Committee in North China has strengthened its lineup, reorganized the Xinminhui, and newly established the North China Anti-Communist Committee to unify and strengthen the various agencies involved in anti-communist work in North China.  The establishment of the North China Material and Price Control Committee is truly a breath of fresh air. At the same time, the people have risen to respond and establish a cooperative system. The recent joint organization of various economic groups and business circles in North China, the "North China Price Cooperation Committee," is clear evidence of this civilian assistance to the authorities. In short, the post-war movement of China is aimed at enhancing combat power through the combined strength of China and Japan, which is a gratifying phenomenon.</p>
<p>At this time, the economic status of North China is becoming increasingly important. North China has inexhaustible military supply resources and abundant human resources. In the past, emphasis was placed on development and increased production to meet Japan's needs, and considerable achievements have been made. Among them, the clearly investigated reserves of coal, a basic military supply material, amount to 1.7 billion tons. With such abundant coal, it is no exaggeration to say that coal is everywhere in North China. Moreover, the quality of coal in North China is not only impressive in quantity but also of a quality not found elsewhere. Therefore, its production exceeds the planned target and increases year by year, fully achieving the two major goals of increasing production and increasing exports to Japan. Regarding iron ore, there are huge reserves in Longyan, Jinlingzhen, and other places. In addition to meeting local needs, there is also the possibility of increasing exports to other places. Regarding ironmaking, due to the establishment of the North China Iron and Steel Co., Ltd., a large-scale ironmaking plan has been implemented. At the same time, small-scale smelting furnaces are being built to meet urgent needs, and ironmaking has already begun in various parts of North China, taking into account the production areas of iron ore and coal. When this plan is realized, it will surely supply a huge amount of steel. As for alumina shale, there are extremely large reserves in Yidong and Zibo, Shandong Province. Like refined aluminum, it is an indispensable raw material for manufacturing alumina and firebricks and production is currently being increased.</p>
<p>Regarding salt, the Changlu and Shandong salt fields are the largest production areas in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Due to its inherent characteristics and effective management, last year's results showed great progress and exceeded the original plan, achieving the goal of supplying Japan. This year, further increases in production are expected. Salt used in industry within the Greater East Asia Sphere will not be in short supply and can fully rely on North China salt. In addition, cotton, the most important wartime material, is also being produced according to the increased production plan. North China has always been known as the largest source of cotton supply within the Greater East Asia Sphere. There are also other important industries, which will not be discussed for the time being. However, in summary, the immediate priorities are to find ways to increase the production of these raw material resources, while striving to produce these raw materials locally, and seeking to adjust transportation capacity. For example, the ironmaking industry mentioned above, various industries using coal as raw material, the chemical industry using salt as raw material, and the fiber industry using cotton as raw material are all economic missions that North China should shoulder in the future. In order to meet this need, various policies have been implemented and will be gradually promoted in the future.</p>
<p>At the same time, the most important thing is the exchange and cooperation of manpower and capital between China and Japan. I believe this is the true meaning of China's participation in the war. This kind of thing has already been realized in the important parts of the North China economy, and in the future, China's manpower and financial resources are also expected to increase to these important industrial parts. It is estimated that tens of millions of yuan will be needed annually for the expansion and addition of various important industries. The allocation of these huge funds will be partially supported by the domestic Japanese market, and at the same time, they will be allocated as much as possible locally, in preparation for gradual implementation. The local allocation of industrial funds has been advocated for many years, but in the past, there was very little industrial capital that could be allocated locally. Fortunately, the timing is now ripe, and in the future, a considerable amount of capital will surely be available locally. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the British and American financial institutions based in the concessions have been closed or controlled. The unified control of North China's finances by the United Reserve Bank of China has been established, financial institutions have also been prepared, and deposits have surged. Moreover, due to the increased issuance of banknotes, civilian funds are extremely abundant. However, absorbing civilian funds and turning them into industrial funds in order to regulate finance and currency is an urgent task. To reiterate, absorbing civilian funds and creating industrial funds is not only a two-pronged approach of collecting funds and utilizing funds, but also the only way to realize the development of industry through Sino-Japanese cooperation, and it truly has a two-pronged effect. Therefore, it is now being made concrete, and a considerable amount of the development funds needed this year are being considered for local fundraising.</p>
<p>Finally, there is one point regarding the economic trends in North China that deserves attention, namely the issue of food prices. Ensuring food supply is the cornerstone of wartime economic operations. North China still relies on foreign imports for part of its food supply and has not yet reached self-sufficiency. However, due to the needs of the situation, it is urgent to establish a self-sufficient system, so all policies are being prepared. What should be given special consideration here is that for the sake of the entire Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere economy, a great deal of cotton production is expected from North China. Therefore, increased agricultural production in North China must advance in both food and cotton. Originally, seeing the arable land, human resources, natural conditions, and other factors in North China, it is extremely possible to implement the two increases in food and cotton. However, ensuring food requires a comprehensive strategy across the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere for appropriate adjustments. The issue of commodity prices is also a basic condition. It is not only an important element in the operation of the heavy industry but also the key to the entire wartime economy. Since last autumn, commodity prices in North China have risen sharply and considerably. Currently, countermeasures are being studied in various departments to combat and suppress price increases.</p>
<p>Regarding the currency sector, on March 10 this year, the China Joint Reserve Bank and the Bank of Japan concluded a loan agreement to strengthen Sino-Japanese financial cooperation, indicating the maintenance of the ratio between the Japanese yen and the joint reserve notes. In late April, Central and Southern China stopped issuing new military scrip notes. The exchange rate between the joint reserve notes and the Central Reserve notes, as well as the ratio of the Japanese yen to the Central Reserve notes, were the same, at 8 yuan to 100 yuan. The status of the joint reserve notes has gradually increased and stabilized, suppressing the trend of runaway inflation, which is worth noting. As for the material sector, promoting its movement, improving the procurement and distribution institutions, and controlling commodity prices are expected to succeed. However, handling the commodity price issue requires the cooperation and practice of the entire population. No matter how hard you try, it will be useless. In particular, the scope of Chinese economic activity is broad, so it is most important for the Chinese to rise up and cooperate to control commodity prices. China's participation in the war has promoted this spirit of cooperation and strengthened this practical system, which is truly gratifying.</p>
<p>In short, China after the war is striving to complete the greatest task of enhancing combat power, as indicated by Chairman Wang, and is working hard to prepare the wartime economic system. The Japanese side has also risen to respond, believing that this invincible and undefeated system will inevitably become more and more solid. (Yunpeng: Translated from the Mainichi Shimbun)</p>

<h3>The Solidarity of the Axis Powers is Increasingly Solid, Laying the Foundation for Final Victory; Italian Participation in the War Third Anniversary; Prime Minister Tojo Sends Words to the Italian People</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - Prime Minister Tojo of Japan, considering the 10th as the third anniversary of Italy's participation in the war, and to express respect for the solidarity of the allied nations in facing national crisis, specially sent words to the Italian people on the 10th through the Italian Stefani News Agency, expressing his firm belief in achieving the final victory. The gist of the words of appreciation is as follows: The Italian nation has resolutely wielded the sword of justice and implemented glorious participation in the war for three years now. This war has gone through two major stages since its beginning: one was Italy's participation in the war in June of Showa 15 (Republic of China 29), and the other was the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War in December of Showa 16 (Republic of China 30). It has been four years since the outbreak of this war. We have established an inevitable foundation for victory in both Europe and East Asia. Now, responding to each other in the East and West, we have entered a decisive battle to annihilate the enemy on a grand scale. The enemy countries, in extreme disarray due to repeated defeats, have attempted to drag neutral countries into the vortex of war, and at the same time boast that they will take large-scale offensive. However, the unity of our Axis powers is becoming increasingly solid with the progress of the war. In particular, the people of Italy, under the guidance of Prime Minister Mussolini, know how to overcome various difficulties with all their strength, and with an invincible spirit, go to the national crisis with one heart and one mind. I pay deep respect at this time. This war is the greatest war in history, so its difficulties are unprecedented. Even if there are any difficulties and obstacles in our path, since we are fighting for justice, I am confident that we will achieve the final victory.</p>
<p>Italian Navy's War Achievements in Three Years</p>
<p>Rome, 10th (Central News Agency) - The Stefani News Agency was ordered last night to publish: From June 10, 1940, to May 31, 1943, the Italian Navy sank a total of 354 anti-Axis warships and merchant ships, totaling 1,753,131 tons. In addition, 79 warships and merchant ships were damaged. The details are as follows: The sunk warships include two battleships, totaling 65,400 tons; 17 cruisers, totaling 120,850 tons; 35 destroyers and torpedo boats, totaling 53,850 tons; 89 submarines, totaling 91,909 tons; 21 auxiliary ships, totaling 34,104 tons. The damaged warships include three battleships, totaling 90,750 tons; two aircraft carriers, totaling 7,450 tons each; 24 cruisers, totaling 188,000 tons; 15 destroyers and torpedo boats, totaling 22,500 tons; three submarines, totaling 3,000 tons; six auxiliary ships, totaling 870 tons. The sunk merchant ships include 159 steamships, totaling 1,200,603 tons; 31 tankers, totaling 276,415 tons. The damaged merchant ships include 18 steamships, totaling 8,660 tons; one tanker, totaling 0,000 tons; seven ships of unknown types, totaling 16,000 tons. At the same time, according to official announcements, as of April 30, 1943, the total number of casualties of the Italian Navy reached 34,746 people, including 3,184 dead, of which 244 were officers; 14,242 missing, of which 790 were officers; 11,921 captured; and 5,401 injured.</p>
<p>Italy Reaffirms Determination to Fight</p>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency) - According to Haitong News Agency: Italian political figures took the opportunity of the third anniversary of their participation in the war to reaffirm Italy's special position in the current war. It is roughly said that when Italy joined Germany's war to defend its rights in the Mediterranean, the Western countries tried to coordinate the Allied forces to attack from both sides. Berlin has always trusted Italy's active force and has not slackened until now. Italy participated in the war out of protecting common interests. Churchill also expressed deep disappointment at the time. When Italy participated in the war, the strength of the British and French Mediterranean fleets was still complete. In just a few years, Italy has now pierced the artery of the British Empire. Although the United States has disregarded its interests in the Pacific and has managed to drive the Axis powers out of Africa, Britain and the United States are still unable to move freely in the Mediterranean. On the contrary, the strength of the Axis powers in dealing with the forces of Britain and the United States with common political motives is increasing day by day. Italy, representing Europe in resisting Britain and the United States in the Mediterranean, knows that Europe is our backing. This is also the confidence that Germany and the entire Europe share. They are determined to fight the enemy to the end.</p>
<h3>Italy's Will to Resist is Firm, Fully Defending Pantelleria Island; Anti-Axis Air and Naval Forces Repeatedly Attack; 116 Aircraft Shot Down</h3>
<p>Rome, 10th (Central News Agency) - After the end of the Tunisian war, the anti-Axis forces launched fierce attacks on the various islands in Italian territory that served as forward and rear bases for Italy itself. Among them, the island of Pantelleria has been bombed as many as 140 times. Recently, the anti-Axis forces have shelled the island four times. In the past month, the island's garrison has shot down 116 anti-Axis aircraft with coastal artillery and anti-aircraft guns, and damaged one enemy warship. On the 8th, the British fleet shelled Pantelleria Island with cruisers and advised the Italian army to surrender, but the Italian army ignored it and shot down five enemy planes and five pursuit planes from the 53rd Air Force Regiment, and resolutely expressed its determination to resist. The commander of the Italian garrison on Pantelleria Island also mobilized all the residents of the island, determined to crush the anti-Axis forces' attempt to land. The islanders, in the difficult situation of the anti-Axis air force bombing, cooperated with the garrison to defend the island.</p>
<h3>Five Countries, Including Spain, Recognize the New Argentine Government</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina, 10th (Central News Agency) - Among the South American countries, the countries that have already recognized the new Argentine government include Brazil, Paraguay, Chile, and Bolivia.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina, 10th (Central News Agency) - Haitong News Agency reported that Uruguay, Venezuela, and Colombia all decided to recognize the new Argentine government this morning. It is widely believed that the Canadian government will also recognize it soon. According to a report from the United Press in Madrid, the Spanish Foreign Ministry has announced its recognition of the new Argentine government.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 9th (Central News Agency) - The London News Chronicle's foreign affairs correspondent stated that both Britain and the United States will recognize the new Argentine government with extreme caution. He also believed that the steps that this new government could take would be different from those of other American governments. News from London stated that the British-Argentine economic conference had been suspended due to this incident, but people in Buenos Aires did not attach importance to this because they knew that Britain had to buy meat from Argentina.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 10th (Central News Agency) - Officials announced yesterday that the government of Argentine President Ramirez is currently implementing the replacement of all foreign diplomatic personnel. At the same time, the first step taken by the new government domestically was to address the people's food problem. The cabinet meeting yesterday also discussed lowering food prices and cracking down on usury. According to a Haitong News Agency reporter here, there will also be changes in the selection of personnel within the Argentine government. In addition to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the undersecretaries of other ministries may be changed within a few days. It is generally believed that the positions of the undersecretaries will be reassigned to military officers.</p>
<h3>President of Uruguay Visits Washington</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency) - According to news from Washington, D.C., Uruguayan President Morini has arrived in Washington for an official visit and will be staying at the White House as a guest of Roosevelt.</p>
<h3>Hundreds of German Aircraft Night Raid Soviet Military Supply Center</h3>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency) - Reliable German sources said today that more than 100 German heavy bombers raided an important military supply center in Yaroslavl last night.

<p>Selected Translations of Current Events</p>
<h3>The Italian Situation on the Eve of the Decisive Battle: Inside the French Committee of National Liberation</h3>
<p>(Special dispatch from Rome by correspondent Ozaki, 2nd) Britain and America are intensifying their air raids on Europe and initiating what they call a "spiritual infiltration of Europe." Britain and America are repeatedly bombing Italy's mainland and its islands, such as Sicily and Sardinia. At the same time, they are using fabricated facts to underestimate Italy's military and economic strength, proclaiming that "Italy has no ability to defend its mainland." They are also conducting propaganda campaigns against the Italian national will and the Fascist regime, aiming to incite anti-war sentiment among the Italian people and begin the work of alienating the Axis powers.</p>
<p>On May 16th, Rome was subjected to its first air raid. British planes scattered leaflets over Rome, stating: "Quickly pursue a separate peace. If you do not separate from Germany, all the cities of Italy will be reduced to ashes."</p>
<p>Italy's strength in both material and spiritual terms is a strong pillar of the Axis camp. Needless to say, Italy is prepared and determined to respond to all Anglo-American propaganda with facts.</p>
<p>Since the withdrawal from Tunisia, the Italian military has not altered its offensive posture. Currently, in conjunction with the German Air Force, it is launching daily strong attacks on Cap Bon, Philippeville, and Algiers in Tunisia. In particular, the bombing of East Africa in recent days, with flights reaching 5,000 kilometers, is sufficient to demonstrate the possibility of bombing the American mainland. At the same time, fighter planes are intercepting enemy aircraft coming to bomb the Italian mainland, shooting down an average of ten aircraft per day, demonstrating Italy's strong stance of resistance. With the cooperation of the navy and air force, Italy firmly maintains control of the Strait of Sicily. The air force, departing from numerous air bases on Sardinia and Sicily, is monitoring the Strait of Sicily day and night.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of this great war, the Italian Navy, with the exception of some damage to cruisers, its battleships and light cruisers remain intact. The two battleships attacked by British aircraft at Taranto naval port in 1940 have now been completely repaired and have rejoined the fleet. The strength of the so-called homeland defense fleet is actually superior to that of the enemy.</p>
<p>British Admiral Sir Andrew Cunningham recently said in the Evening Standard:</p>
<p>"The victory of the anti-Axis forces in North Africa cannot guarantee control of the Mediterranean."</p>
<p>Since Italy adopted the so-called strategy of concentrating the battle line, the elevation of the power of the navy and air force has become even more substantial.</p>
<p>As for the army, although it suffered some losses in the North African campaign, there are now [redacted number] of Italian troops, plus volunteers, in Italy, Albania, Greece, and the Balkans. These troops in Italy and Greece are currently earnestly implementing enhancements and strengthening equipment in preparation for an Anglo-American invasion of the mainland. The number of tanks and automobiles is increasing rapidly, and the number of cannons deployed along the Italian coast alone has reached [redacted number].</p>
<p>These many weapons are, of course, all manufactured in Italy. Due to air raids and transportation issues, current military industries have undergone some changes, with smaller factories being forced to make some adjustments. However, large factories are all fully operational. The supply of steel and other materials from Germany is also quite smooth, and there is no state of operations being halted due to material shortages. Aircraft are also being manufactured in these many factories. Fighter planes and night fighters are the most urgently needed, so production is being greatly increased. New types of bombers have also recently appeared. In short, there is no anxiety regarding the operation of general military industries and the equipping of the military. After the Tunisian campaign, they are expanding and strengthening rapidly.</p>
<p>What, then, is the will of the Italian people, which Britain and America regard as the center of their propaganda strategy? Fascism, the spiritual foundation of the Italian people, and the Fascist regime, the root of war guidance, are becoming increasingly solid, regardless of the slanderous propaganda from Britain and America. Today, in order to carry out war, all countries are more or less adopting totalitarian or Fascist economic controls and national organizations. How will Britain and America themselves explain the fact that democracy is disappearing as a result of this great war and that dictatorial political forms are being adopted, while propagating that "the Italian people are estranged from the Fascist regime"? Even a three-year-old child understands that this propaganda is completely baseless.</p>
<p>Fascism has a longer history and foundation than the decade-long Roosevelt administration. Moreover, workers, farmers, and the military are the body of the movement. Regarding this point, let's cite an example to illustrate how foolish British propaganda is. Britain recently propagated that "the number of Fascist Party members has greatly decreased this year compared to last year." However, the fact is that last year's survey was for a twelve-month period, while this year's survey was only for a four-month period. During the busy farming season, most farmers have not yet completed the procedures for renewing their party membership cards. Italian farmers simply laughed at this propaganda.</p>
<p>In short, Italy, under the leadership of Prime Minister Mussolini, is absolutely not lagging behind and is fully fulfilling the important task of being a pillar of the Axis powers. (Extracted and rewritten from the Yomiuri Hochi newspaper of June 4th)</p>
<p>(Special telegram from Zurich by correspondent Taguchi, 4th) As a result of the meeting between Giraud and de Gaulle, the newly established "French Committee of National Liberation" in North Africa held its first meeting in Algiers on the 4th. They discussed the dismissal of French West Africa Governor-General Boisson, West African Atlantic Fleet Commander Missouri, and others. The discussion lasted quite a while. De Gaulle's side plans to have two members of his faction, Rochat and d'Argenlieu, fill two vacancies in the aforementioned committee. The outcome is not yet known. According to observations by some neutral parties regarding the establishment of this "French Committee of National Liberation," Giraud and de Gaulle have reached an understanding, and they will mutually serve as chairmen of the committee. The British headquarters handed over the political leadership of the French rebels to de Gaulle, while entrusting the actual military power to Giraud. As a result of Roosevelt and Churchill's earnest discussions, although they want to utilize the labor of Giraud's faction for the reconstruction of France after the war, the problem now is that they still have concerns about the Soviet Union. They cannot disregard de Gaulle either. Therefore, at least for the time being, they plan to implement a two-headed policy.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that de Gaulle himself is not a progressive. The people surrounding him include moderates, liberals, and even extreme leftists such as communists. According to reports from Nyon and Zuger Nachrichten, de Gaulle is not only a member of the original French Popular Front, but also continues to secretly move and maintain close ties with the French Communist Party. As for Giraud, he is directed by capitalists and bureaucrats in French North Africa and naturally has incompatible relations with de Gaulle's faction. Despite this, the reason why the French rebels are still implementing a two-headed policy is that, in addition to the aforementioned political reasons, there is also a military necessity.</p>
<p>In order to carry out the war against the Axis powers, they must enlist all French elements. Regarding this point, it should be noted that former French Legion commander Georges, the proposer of the so-called "Georges Plan," has been appointed as a member of the committee. This "Georges Plan" is a plan to conquer the Italian mainland using French bases. Whether this plan is within the scope of the anti-Axis powers' European landing operation is another matter, but the fact that such an active proponent has been selected as a member of the puppet government surely explains the intentions of the anti-Axis camp.</p>
<p>Why is the "North African French Central Executive Committee" not called the "French Provisional Government" but is still called a committee? Neutral observers believe that even Roosevelt and Churchill doubt to what extent the labor of de Gaulle, Giraud, etc. will be utilized after the war, because they lack the actual support of the upper echelons of French society. At the same time, they are very aware of how powerless and provisional the French social structure, especially in politics, will be after the war without a financial foundation. Therefore, even if they want to utilize Giraud's labor in the future, the problem now is that a puppet regime without territory is ultimately an abnormal form. The name "committee" is fully understood based on this inner situation.</p>
<p>According to further intelligence, de Gaulle once caused a dispute over Giraud's proposal for a "complete merger" during the establishment of this committee. The above situation suggests that the merger of the two factions is only at the level of a partial "understanding." (Extracted and translated from the Western Asahi Shimbun of June 6th)</p>

<h3>Police Authorities Guide the Baojia System to Prevent Terrorism, Assist the Police in Exerting Self-Defense Forces</h3>
<p>The Public Concession Police Department, recognizing the complexity of the residents within the Concession and the fact that the jurisdiction is the general transportation hub of this city, inevitably harbors lurking criminals or transient passersby. If criminal incidents occur, they may also be regarded as target areas by these individuals, disrupting the overall public order of this city. This situation is, of course, observed by the police authorities. However, the desire of residents to generate their own self-defense forces and assist the police in seeking a life of peace and security is the responsibility that Baojia self-defense personnel in service should fulfill. According to the reporter's inquiries, the police authorities have already actively launched work to prevent and control terrorist incidents and have formulated a general outline of measures. They will establish closer contact with the affiliated Baojia personnel, striving to ensure that when terrorist and other major incidents occur, proper assistance will facilitate the arrest of offenders. The key points of this general outline are excerpted below:</p>
<p>Measures that Self-Defense Corps Members Should Take: (1) When an incident occurs, the self-defense corps members should take the following measures:</p>
<p>A. When encountering criminals and suspects, do their best to arrest them and take preventive measures to avoid escape.</p>
<p>B. Immediately sound the whistle to alert other self-defense corps and on-duty police officers to provide assistance, and report to the police station in the fastest possible way.</p>
<p>C. The crime scene should maintain its original state, and avoid trampling, waiting for the police authorities to arrive at the scene for investigation.</p>
<p>D. If hand grenades, timed bombs, or other explosives are found at the incident site, take appropriate measures to isolate the public and prevent them from approaching the dangerous area.</p>
<p>E. Those who discover the incident and eyewitnesses to the prior and subsequent circumstances are all powerful witnesses. They should all be detained near the incident site and reported when police officers arrive at the scene.</p>
<p>F. Those injured as a result of the incident should be moved to a safe place immediately, and within the possible scope, first aid and hemostasis should be provided. Personnel should be assigned to guard them and report when police officers arrive at the scene.</p>
<p>(2) When an incident occurs, senior Baojia officials (Deputy Lianbao Chief and above) should immediately try to contact the police station and rush to the incident site to await investigation. The head of the search headquarters will order and direct subordinate Baojia personnel to assist the police authorities in the search.</p>
<p>(3) The Baojia officials of the Baojia district within the small blockade area will immediately gather in front of the search headquarters and line up to await orders. (Note) The small blockade area is designated by the head of the search headquarters.</p>
<p>(4) Within the small blockade area, the Bao Chief, Jia Chief, Household Chief, and Self-Defense Corps members of the Baojia district should take the following measures while waiting for orders from the police station:</p>
<p>A. Pedestrians on the road should be arranged in male and female rows in the center of the road, waiting for instructions from the guiding police authorities.</p>
<p>B. Those who linger or escape into the lanes, or those who pass through the lanes but are not residents of the lanes, should be led to the road near the lane and arranged separately (still divided into male and female, and not mixed with those passing on the road), waiting for instructions from the police authorities.</p>
<p>C. Those indoors should be arranged indoors according to the household registration survey form. Those from outside the household should stand in front of the door, waiting for the guidance of the police authorities.</p>
<p>D. Department stores, theaters, cinemas, dance halls, amusement parks, hotels, restaurants, teahouses, etc., if they hear the blockade alarm in their jurisdiction and learn of the incident, must immediately close the entrances and exits, and the people inside should remain in their original seats, quietly waiting for the guidance of the police authorities.</p>
<p>The Lao Zha Police Station Actively Promotes: The above regulations are what Baojia personnel and residents should do and abide by. At the same time, the police chief who receives the report of the incident will immediately arrive at the scene and set up the search headquarters. The head of the search headquarters will then contact the neighboring police stations and police authorities, and direct subordinate police officers and senior Baojia officials to handle the situation and proceed. Furthermore, it is learned that the Lao Zha Police Station area is the bustling heartland of the Public Concession. Therefore, Chief Nakano of the police station has been actively promoting this general outline of measures. He has given detailed guidance to all Baojia personnel at the joint Baojia meeting, hoping to complete the task as soon as possible. It is also learned that this measure can be effective. After the police and the people truly cooperate, it is possible to arrest the criminal offenders within one hour if an incident occurs.</p>
<h3>Mayor Chen Approves Unified Planning to Improve Civil Servants' Treatment</h3>
<p>In recent years, due to the continuous increase in the cost of living index, the lives of ordinary civil servants have become a serious problem. Since this newspaper has repeatedly called for improved treatment, it has now aroused the attention and sympathy of people from all walks of life. It is learned that Commissioner Zhang Yongding and others of the Municipal Government, upon Mayor Chen's instructions, said: "I have always sympathized with the living conditions of civil servants, and I have repeatedly presented them to Chairman Wang, hoping that everyone will share the difficulties, temporarily persevere, and wait for unified planning. There must be a way to comfort the expectations of officials." It is hoped that in the near future, the issue of improving the lives of civil servants in this city will have a satisfactory solution.</p>
<h3>North China Relief Society Studies Fundraising Methods, Organizes a Design Committee for Discussion at Any Time</h3>
<p>The Shanghai All Circles North China Relief Society held its second meeting of the Standing Council at its headquarters at 4:00 PM yesterday. Municipal Government Secretary-General Zhao Zunyu also attended and participated. Standing Council members included Yuan Lvdeng, Wen Lant Ting, Lin Kanghou, Wu Yunzhai, Li Sihao, Pei Yunqing, Xu Jianping, Qin Runqing, Chen Binhe, Huang Jinrong, Xu Tieshan, Tang Shoumin, Ye Fuxiao, Zhao Jinqing, Sun Mingqi, Pan Da, Wu Zhenxiu, Yan Junren, etc. Attending were Chen Dongbai and Li Gongjie, etc. Chairman Yuan Lvdeng first reported on the agenda items and then discussed the proposals: (1) A notice will be published to solicit donations from painters, calligraphers, and collectors to hold a charity sale. The contributors will indicate the price of each item sent to the society, and the society will give a receipt and number them for registration. The society will then ask experts to re-mark the selling price. After the sale, all proceeds will be donated to the society to relieve the disaster victims in North China. (2) Organize an entertainment committee. The society's propaganda group will separately hire people familiar with the entertainment industry to organize it. They will separately contact various entertainment groups for performances. (3) Organize a design committee. The society will hire enthusiastic people with experience to organize it. They will meet once a week to study fundraising methods for reference. Zhang Yunbo, Lin Kanghou, Li Wenjie, Sun Mingqi, etc. will handle this. Secretary-General Lin will report at the third meeting of the Standing Council next Thursday, and the resolutions were passed and approved: (1) Publish a notice to unify donations. (2) Add four banks to collect donations: Bu Ye Bank, Universal Trust Bank, Dahua Bank, and Sha Ye Bank.</p>
<h3>This Newspaper's Collection of Relief Donations Has Ended</h3>
<p>Yesterday, various circles still submitted North China disaster relief donations to this newspaper for collection. However, now this donation has been entrusted to various banks and financial institutions by the relief society to handle in order to unify it. This newspaper has already ended this collection. Therefore, those who donate for relief can directly pay to the designated banks and financial institutions nearby. Yesterday (the 10th), Mr. Sun Zhaoming of Xie Da Xiang sent a letter donating 10,000 yuan, which has been paid to Jin Cheng Bank for collection (receipt number 000190). His enthusiasm for helping relief efforts is truly admirable. Also, on the 9th, we received 4,000 yuan donated by the Shanghai Dairy Factory and its colleagues for the Dragon Boat Festival, 4,000 yuan remitted by Dean Gu Nanqun and colleagues of Nanyang Hospital, and 2,000 yuan remitted by Tongde Sauce Garden and others in Chongming Bridge Town, all of which are commendable.</p>
<p>Furthermore, previously, Pei Jun wished to sell a violin for 2,000 yuan for charity to help relief efforts, which has been reported in previous reports. Now, we have received a letter stating that Mr. Jin has purchased it and the money has been paid to the Bank of China for collection.</p>
<h3>Charity Performance to Help Relief Efforts</h3>
<p>After Huang Jinrong, Chen Fuyuan, Gong Tianjian, etc. contacted the major theaters regarding this North China relief effort, the response was quite satisfactory. In addition to the Jin Cheng Grand Theater, which held a charity performance last night, the Great World will donate its entire ticket revenue on the 14th to help relief efforts. Other theaters, such as the Huang Jin Grand Theater and Tianchan Stage, will jointly hold a charity performance with a target of 50,000 yuan. The Gong Stage and Grand Stage will jointly hold a charity performance with a target of 30,000 yuan. The Queen's Grand Theater and Renewal Stage will jointly hold a charity performance with a target of 40,000 yuan. If the above targets are not met, each theater will make up the difference. If the target is exceeded, they also plan to send the excess to the relief society to help relief efforts.</p>
<p>The Guangming Barber Shop at the corner of the racecourse on Jing'an Temple Road has decided to donate all of its business revenue on Saturday, the 12th of this month, without deducting expenses, to help disaster victims. It is heard that the money will be paid to the Shanghai Chinese Christian United Association for transfer to the North China Christian Protestant Group, managed by Bishop Jiang Changchuan, to implement relief efforts. This is also noted here.</p>
<h3>This Newspaper Has Paid All North China Relief Donations Collected on Behalf of Donors, Except for Guohua Bank, Which Paid Interest</h3>
<p>The North China relief donations collected by this newspaper from all walks of life, up to the 9th, totaled 861,327.70 yuan, plus 1,000 yuan in Joint Reserve Notes. On the 5th of this month, 500,000 yuan was first transferred to the Tongrun Money Shop, and a temporary receipt was obtained. Yesterday, the remaining funds were delivered to Tongrun Money Shop for collection and the previous temporary receipt was exchanged for two official receipts, numbers 728 and 729, from the North China Relief Society. These will be published in the next two days to show the truth.</p>
<p>Before the North China Relief Society designated the collecting banks and financial institutions, the money collected by this newspaper was transferred to the Guohua Bank every day. Now, it has been withdrawn. However, although the date of receipt and payment was very short, the bank still agreed to pay interest as an exception. After the settlement, it will be delivered again. This is noted on behalf of the disaster victims to express gratitude.</p>
<h3>Charity Exhibition of Paintings and Calligraphy</h3>
<p>This newspaper launched a charity sale of paintings and calligraphy to relieve the North China disaster victims, which was deeply supported by all sectors of society. Many people donated famous paintings and calligraphy to support the charity. The titles of the gentlemen who donated paintings and calligraphy for the charity sale yesterday are listed below:</p>
<p>(1) Tu Siruo donated (1) Li Xin's painting, a vertical axis of "Amitabha Buddha," priced at 500 yuan; (2) Wu Xingfen's landscape painting, a vertical axis, priced at 400 yuan; (3) Chen Shengshu's painting, a vertical axis of the "Three Friends," priced at 400 yuan; (4) Zhang Tianqi's painting, a vertical axis of ink lotus, priced at 300 yuan.</p>

Also, Mr. Li is willing to write 100 fan surfaces, with a fee of 30 yuan per surface, all of which will be used for relief donations.</p>
<p>(7) Zou Mengchan donated a cursive script, vertical axis.</p>
<p>(8) Wu Daiqiu sent a letter saying that he would sell ten fan surfaces co-created by father and son for charity, with a fee of 260 yuan per surface, all of which will be used for charity relief. Those who request paintings should provide their own fan surfaces and fees and hand them over to this newspaper for transfer. Contact Wu at No. 82 Siming Village, Foch Road, with the receipt.</p>
<h3>Baojia Youth Department Lecture</h3>
<p>In addition to actively training members and intensifying members' social service work, the Baojia Youth Department has recently focused on improving members' knowledge. At 8:00 PM tonight, Mr. Chen Binhe will be invited to give a lecture on "North China Disaster Relief and Youth Responsibility" on the third floor of the Western YMCA on Jing'an Temple Road.</p>
<h3>The Police Authorities Talk About the Suicide of Lu Hengming</h3>
<p>The police authorities issued a statement on the suicide of Lu Hengming, saying: "Regarding the case of the police officer of the Jing'an Temple Police Station and Lu Hengming, in order to avoid misunderstandings from the outside world, the police authorities now release the truth as follows: This incident occurred on June 6 at the Zhengzhang Dry Cleaning Shop at the intersection of Foch Road and Muir Road. The shop owner, Zhu Jueiming, dismissed six of the twelve employees and detained the citizen cards of the six people. This is actually the major reason for the accident. Therefore, this incident was a private dispute between Lu Hengming and the shop owner. When the incident occurred, the police officer of the Jing'an Temple Police Station was off-duty and happened to be in the Zhengzhang Shop. Therefore, he mediated at this time and did not actually participate in this incident. The autopsy results showed that there were minor injuries on both hands of the body. This was caused by the mutual dispute between Lu and the shop owner. Moreover, these minor injuries were not the cause of death. Lu committed suicide by taking poison because he felt wronged and dissatisfied."</p>
<h3>Mr. Wen Lant Ting Responds to the Frugal Banquet Covenant</h3>
<p>Since this newspaper advocated the "Frugal Banquet Covenant," various circles have sent letters responding, saying: "I have been practicing frugality in banquets for a long time, but it was only carried out within myself and my family. I did not have the idea of popularizing it in society at first. Now that your newspaper is widely promoting it, who would not want to abide by this covenant under the current level of living? I am the first to agree to participate. I hope that people in society will abide by this covenant and change the decadent customs," etc. This is truly a social model.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Public Cemetery Registration Deadline Extended to the 15th of This Month</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Government has approved a letter from the Supervisory Section of the Japanese Naval Attaché's Office regarding the need for relocation due to military use in the Shanghai Public Cemetery area. The announcement was made to all grave owners by the Municipal Health Bureau, requiring them to bring their documents to the bureau for registration by the end of May. It is now learned that the bureau has submitted a request to the Municipal Government to extend the registration period to the 15th of this month in order to facilitate the self-relocation of graves, as some grave owners may not be able to register in time.</p>

<h3>Xuhui Scholarship Football, Chinese Mixed Team Wins Over Jewish Team, Score Two to Zero</h3>
<p>The first match of the scholarship football charity game organized by Xuhui Middle School, Shanghai Northern Expeditionary Army vs. Jewish team, took place at the school at 5:15 PM yesterday. There were 5,000 spectators, an unprecedented scene. The Chinese mixed team exerted its utmost power and defeated the Jewish team by two to zero. The referee was He Chunhui. Xie Xiaochu's wife kicked off the game. During the match, a charity ball was auctioned. After fierce bidding, Xie Xiaochu's wife finally won the bid for 25,000 yuan. After the game, School Trustee Ji Zhiyao gave a thank-you speech. In yesterday's game, the individual techniques of Jia Youliang, Li Yichen, and Zhang Lingeng of the Chinese mixed team were excellent, and the young player Li Yao also had a good performance and was well received. The two defenders, Sharman and Mania, of the Jewish team performed well. In the first half, Li Yichen scored from about 25 yards away. After the break, the young player Li Yao received the ball from Jia Youliang and scored again. When time ran out, the Chinese mixed team won over the Jewish team by two to zero. It is heard that the second match of the charity game is scheduled for Monday, the 14th (next Monday), with the Chinese mixed team playing against Portugal. This newspaper reported the above information at 6:40 PM.</p>
<h3>Clearing of Streets in Western Shanghai, Managed Entirely by the Municipal Government and the Public Works Department</h3>
<p>After the Shanghai Special Municipal Government and the Public Works Department jointly announced the satisfactory resolution of various issues in the western Shanghai area, the Shanghai Special Municipal Government decided to cooperate with the Public Works Department to launch a campaign to clear the streets in the entire western Shanghai area in order to prevent the possible outbreak of epidemics and to emphasize public health. At that time, the cleaning of the main roads in the area will be entrusted to the Public Works Department of the Public Works Department. At the same time, the land outside the roads will be cleaned by personnel sent by the Municipal Government. Cooperation with Baojia personnel will be obtained to promote the work smoothly. Detailed methods are being formulated by the two municipal authorities.</p>
<p>Short Comments</p>
<h3>Suggestions Regarding Emergency Relief Funds</h3>
<p>Yesterday, we received suggestions from two young people regarding emergency relief in North China. We found them to be quite insightful:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding how relief goods should be distributed fairly and equitably after they arrive in the disaster area, thorough preparations should be made beforehand. Information should be gathered from local authorities and impartial local individuals regarding the area of the disaster zone, the population, the extent of the disaster, etc., to serve as the basis for distribution.</p>
<p>(2) There are many tofu shops in Shanghai and neighboring counties. The leftover residue from their soybean products (i.e., tofu dregs) can be made into dried cakes to serve as food for the disaster victims. The price is low, the quantity is large, and it is worth purchasing.</p>
<p>Although the first point concerns future events, it is the most important step in the end. If preparations can be made in advance, there will be no confusion when the time comes. It is indeed a point worth emphasizing. We hope that the emergency relief agencies will promote this work. The second point is a concrete measure, and we hope that the emergency relief committee will consider it. We also hope that those familiar with this issue, or who have expertise in the technology of purchasing and making these cakes, will communicate and consult directly with the emergency relief committee, so that anything that benefits the disaster victims can become a reality.</p>
<p>In addition, if people from all walks of life see concrete measures similar to the second point above, they may as well offer their suggestions.</p>
<p>Economic Realm: A Brief Commentary</p>
<h3>Commercial Control and the Spirit of Autonomy</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the establishment of the National Association for the Control of Commerce, it advocated the four words "impartiality, integrity, and brightness" to encourage staff. What is impartiality? Sacrificing the interests of the individual to complete the welfare of the public, without favoritism, without benefiting oneself. What is integrity? Eliminating opportunists who exploit opportunities for private gain, selecting talented people who speak frankly and dare to state the truth without flattery or prejudice, working hard and practically, with no room for compromise. What is incorruptibility? Not taking a penny without authorization, not benefiting oneself at public expense, putting others before oneself, and maintaining self-discipline. What is brightness? Concealed and tolerated bad elements in the association must be thoroughly purged. Dishonest personnel who use trickery and labor to infiltrate must be eliminated. If these four can be clarified, the spirit of "collective commercial self-government control" can be realized. It must be known that impartiality, integrity, incorruptibility, and brightness are not one-sided, or only for a small number of people, but collective and complete. If one person commits fraud in handling commercial affairs, then strict criminal law should be used to impose the most severe legal sanctions. In particular, lower-level members of various guilds should be strictly prevented from using their names and influence to pursue private gain, commit fraud, and deceive merchants. As far as I know, I already feel that this kind of concern is inevitable. Those who bear the full responsibility for the Commercial Control Association should realize this as soon as possible and urgently plan preventive measures. Official assistance and social supervision must not be relaxed in any way. If even this spirit of autonomy cannot be achieved, then one wrong move will lead to total failure. In the future, villains and flatterers, under this beautiful name, will do evil and commit wrongdoing to facilitate their private business and seize their private interests, I fear they will arise one after another. Thinking about it, I am alarmed; thinking about it again, I feel sweat running down my back. The wise and enlightened standing committee of the Commercial Control Association should examine themselves in the still of the night and consider how to be vigilant and fearful, encourage colleagues, and exhort people in various guilds to live up to the spirit of "collective commercial self-government control"!</p>
<h3>Methods for Various Banks and Financial Institutions to Submit Active Deposit Reserve Funds: Public Debt Grain Certificates Accepted for 60% of Payment</h3>
<p>In order to protect the interests of depositors, various banks and financial institutions in the silver and money industry shall pay deposit reserve funds in accordance with the law. The Central Reserve Bank shall open a reserve fund account. The 5% reserve fund for fixed deposits and special current deposits has already been paid. The 10% reserve fund for current deposits has been accommodated in two installments. The second installment of the reserve fund to be paid has recently been remitted starting in June. The methods of payment are recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) The second 5% reserve fund for current deposits to be paid by various banks and financial institutions is allowed to be accommodated with a two-month extension, delayed until June 1. The amount of current deposits listed in the statement as of May 31 will be re-verified and continue to be deposited. (2) The interest on current deposits in the Central Reserve Bank is 1% per week, and the interest on interbank deposits is 2% per week. The interest on the deposit reserve fund for various banks and financial institutions has been increased to 3%, which is higher than the general deposit interest rate. Moreover, according to the regulations of the Inspection Office, the reserve fund for current deposits may be temporarily paid with substitutes such as real estate gold bars, stable public debt, or grain warehouse certificates for 60% of the value. (3) Regarding the item of overdrafts in current accounts, but which are indeed in the nature of current deposits, and the Inspection Office does not calculate the reserve fund on a daily basis, but verifies and deposits it according to the monthly statement at the end of the month. For example, if someone deposits one million yuan on the first day of a certain month and withdraws it on the 29th, the Inspection Office will not verify the payment of the reserve fund. Therefore, for a single account, changes in the amount of deposits and debts are inevitable, but for the total amount, there should not be much difference. The matter concerns a general case, and it is not appropriate to exclude the item of overdrafts in current accounts from calculation. The deposit reserve fund should be paid in accordance with the regulations. (4) The payment of a portion of the reserve fund for current deposits with substitutes is a temporary accommodation measure. The reserve fund for fixed and special current deposits should not be taken as an example. The entire amount should be paid in cash according to the verified amount.</p>
<h3>The Central Reserve Bank Provides Interbank Lending, Still Handled by the Bankers' Association, Limited to 400 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>After the Central Reserve Bank took over the clearing of the balance of the Bankers' Association's bill exchange, interbank lending will continue to be handled by the Bankers' Association. The Central Reserve Bank will provide lending funds, limited to 400 million yuan, but the specific measures are being negotiated. The major ones will be handled in accordance with the new measures revised on March 24. The lending banks and financial institutions are limited to the following: (1) Member banks of the Shanghai Banking Association. (2) Member money shops of the Shanghai Money Shop Association. (3) Various banks and financial institutions that have dealings with the Reserve Board. Anyone requesting a loan must provide collateral, such as government securities, Chinese merchant stocks, real estate, or goods. The Loan Committee of the Reserve Board will determine the total amount of loans for each bank and financial institution, but it must not exceed the sum of the paid-in capital and reserve fund of the bank and financial institution. It will be handled according to the discounted assessed price. The term is limited to ten days, and the interest rate will be determined by the Bankers' Association at any time.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Food Revises the Regulations of the Fisheries Construction Fee Collection Office</h3>
<p>The Aquatic Products Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Food, in order to develop the aquatic products industry, has, upon submission, been approved by the Executive Yuan to resume collecting fisheries construction fees, and collect them at the original rate of 2.5%. In January of this year, a Fisheries Construction Fee Collection Office was established to be solely responsible for management. Since the start of collection, the receipts have been prosperous. It has been found that the organization regulations of the office were originally submitted to the Ministry of Industry and approved for implementation. Now it is learned that the authorities of the Ministry of Food believe that the bureau has changed its affiliation, and the organization regulations of the office should be revised and promulgated for implementation to clarify the system. Therefore, the ministry has copied and issued a revised order, instructing the bureau to be informed, and instructing the Fisheries Construction Fee Collection Office to comply with and implement it from the date of promulgation.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Food Plans to Build Grain Storage Warehouses in Various Places</h3>
<p>After the National Government issued two types of grain warehouse certificates, A and B, in 1942, for a total of 500 million yuan in national currency, to purchase rice and build grain storage warehouses, they were all taken over by the Central Reserve Bank and sublet to the various banks and financial institutions in the silver and money industry for recognition. Recently, it was heard that the Ministry of Food, in view of the availability of funds for purchasing grain and building warehouses, has decided to establish warehouses in appropriate locations in various provinces and cities, in addition to implementing unified purchasing and centralized distribution, in order to properly store grain in accordance with scientific principles. The locations of the storage warehouses are Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Danyang, Yangzhou, Gaoyou, Douying, Fanshui, Taizhou, Dongtai, Xinghua, Jiangyan, Suzhou, Changzhou, Wuxi, Changshu, Kunshan, Songjiang, Jiaxing, Hangzhou, Huzhou, Wuhu, Dangtu, Anqing, and other places.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Economic Bureau Continues to Investigate Chinese-Owned Businesses</h3>
<p>The Municipal Economic Bureau has reviewed and approved 350 Chinese-owned businesses and issued licenses for them to operate. It is reported that the bureau is still sending personnel to continue the secret investigation of other businesses that have applied to the bureau for registration but have not yet been approved. It is also learned that, for the sake of caution, in addition to the personnel sent, the bureau will still issue attendance certificates, and instruct the personnel to first hand over the attendance certificates to the businesses for inspection before the investigation, in order to verify their identities. Those who do not hold this attendance certificate are obviously lawless people who intend to extort money. It is hoped that businesses will pay close attention to this. If there is such a situation, it can be immediately reported to the bureau for transfer to the police authorities for strict handling. Please do not be fooled.</p>
<h3>Trends in Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks were stable. New and old investors were active in absorbing stocks in the midst of growing credit, sparing no effort. However, they were suppressed by some sellers seeking cash. Various stocks rose and fell in succession, fluctuating within a narrow range. Although people's hearts in all directions are still uneasy, the foundation has become firmer. Yong'an Company in the department store industry rose slightly due to the news of bonus shares, Xin Xin declined slightly, and Guohuo rose slightly, all only shrinking by more than a yuan. Chinese underwear and Liangfu socks held steady at the original price. The textile industry was the most stable. Yong'an Yarn Factory, Meiya Silk Factory, Xinfeng Printing and Dyeing, etc. were not short of buyers in progress. The new pharmaceutical industry has become stagnant. Sino-French fluctuated only by a few cents that day. New Asia insisted on staying around the pass, and Zhongxi Drugstore continued to rise.

<h3>The Vitality of Youth</h3>
<p>— Hong Ying</p>
<p>Youth has vigorous vigor, an active mind, and passionate emotions. Youth also has great ambitions, lofty ideals… Therefore, the youth era is the most beautiful era in life.</p>
<p>Youth is rich in initiative and creativity. Often, many young people, due to a momentary emotional impulse and the drive of curiosity, bravely and firmly move forward. There are also young people who, in order to realize their ideals, disregard everything and use their own strength, heat, and blood to promote everything in difficult and contradictory situations, so that life continues to progress to new realms. This kind of force-created phenomenon is a characteristic of general youth.</p>
<p>When we read the biographies of great men, we learn that their true lives began in their youth. In their youth, in addition to diligently seeking knowledge to satisfy their thirst for knowledge, their thoughts often changed due to the influence of the outside world. Their lives were also shifted due to the control of the environment. They had one characteristic, which was that they were never satisfied with the reality of life, but worked non-stop to create. Relying on reason, they exerted their talents, used the vitality of youth, and devoted themselves to the work they considered most valuable, hoping that their lives could reach a realm of beauty and goodness. Therefore, they obtained a fulfilling life, leaving behind many generous, passionate, and moving great deeds in their lives.</p>
<p>The great German philosopher Fichte said: "If we want to accomplish great things, we must do it in our youth." This is a very valuable sentence. Youth has many innate superior conditions, like the light in the middle of the day, full of the breath of "youth." The "vitality of life" makes us brave to work. Young friends, don't you feel the emptiness of life? Don't you have beautiful dreams? I advise you faithfully, please keep Kant's words in mind, don't be timid, don't hesitate, you must seize reality, use youth, and work hard to create your career and create your new life!</p>
<h3>The Depression of Children</h3>
<p>— Can Jun</p>
<p>Children are the future masters of the country, but now these future masters are encountering dangerous misfortunes!</p>
<p>In this turbulent era, the changing environment, the difficulty of life, and the heavy responsibility of supporting families and cultivating children are the most serious problems that every parent currently feels. Parents struggling below the lifeline slowly become thin and old. Due to the harsh environment and the difficulty of life, these future masters have produced various tragedies.</p>
<p>1. Parents living in a depressed and struggling situation are often plagued by troubles and grievances, and innocent children are the only tools for venting, which gives children a great stimulus. Therefore, they are gradually deprived of their innocent and lively minds and develop a timid and weak temperament.</p>
<p>2. Because parents are forced by the economy, it is difficult for them to bear the cost of their children's schooling. Therefore, children rarely receive a fairly complete education, and the level of knowledge and culture is invisibly reduced. Children growing up in this environment, even if they have good talents, are difficult to develop, so they often make low-pitched requests, hoping for effective help.</p>
<p>3. Because of the simplicity of daily diet, poor nutrition affects the health and incomplete development of the body; in addition, poor and incompetent parents cannot afford expensive medicines, so when diseases often ravage children's bodies, they are allowed to run rampant, killing their small lives in a short period of time.</p>
<p>4. Many children are already helping their parents, relying on their small strength to obtain this small income, but children's strength is limited, often exhausted due to overwork, groaning in bed; or even becoming ill and unable to recover. Furthermore, there are those who are whipped by life, living like beasts, with no day to look up under the cruel treatment; there are also orphans who are forced by life or have no relatives to turn to, wandering the streets, being used by others, engaging in abnormal activities, and being seduced by the poor environment, losing their will and the depravity of their personality. This affects the evolution of society and the country, and perhaps even affects social security and the future of the country.</p>
<p>Although there are many children who are free from the danger of freezing and starvation, live in wealthy environments, and lead comfortable lives, children in high positions are not necessarily successful, and children in low classes are not necessarily unsuccessful. Because the lessons they have learned are hard work, self-motivation, diligence, and endurance, they are gradually tempered by the lessons of the environment and the difficulties of the situation, so their talents may be higher. Therefore, saving these poor children is a serious problem today. We must strive to irrigate these small lives that are about to be destroyed, so that they can be reborn, develop, and bear great fruit.</p>

<h3>Collection of Couplets in Regular Script by Elder Chongde</h3>
<p>— Zhu Xingzhi</p>
<p>Elder's handwritten maxims and couplets have frequently appeared in newspapers. Some years ago, I received a post of handwritten couplets collected in regular script by the Elder from the late Zheng Zhongying, which is especially precious and worth reciting. The characters are also quite elegant. I had this couplet mounted and hung beside my seat as a reminder. Although the Elder has now passed away, looking at this couplet is like seeing the man himself, forever immortal. I am recording the original couplet as follows:</p>
<p>"Often cultivate the taste of sweet dew liberation, Eliminate stinginess, greed, and jealousy."</p>
<p>Postscript: Jealousy is resentment, greed is seeking; The late Minister Wenzheng wrote a poem on resentment and seeking, using these two words to severely discipline himself. He once said that by achieving serenity, one can eliminate jealousy, which is one joy; and that by luck, one can obtain the taste of sweet dew liberation. Therefore, I have compiled a couplet from the Compassionate Water Repentance, as the ways of self-cultivation in Confucianism and Buddhism are indeed the same. Written by Elder Chongde in the late winter of the year Ji Mao [1939], at the age of eighty-eight. (To assist with the urgent relief in North China)</p>
<h3>Prelude to "La Traviata" Performance</h3>
<p>— Yi Quan</p>
<p>Performance: June 12th to 15th, 5 PM</p>
<p>Location: Lyceum Theatre</p>
<p>The opera "La Traviata" will finally be performed on the 12th under the management of the China Opera Company. Anyone concerned about the development of Western music in China cannot but pay attention.</p>
<p>The "China Opera Company" was organized by Mr. Luo Jingwei, Mr. Wu Zhengqian, and Mr. Wang Jutan. They originally hoped to hire Chinese performers to perform Italian opera, creating a new page in the history of Western music in China. However, due to various difficulties and practical impossibilities, they had to borrow a few foreigners this time.</p>
<p>I believe that the greatest goal of every singing student is to be able to perform in an opera. There are many singers among the Chinese in Shanghai, but because they have never been organized, they have never had the opportunity to show their talents. The purpose of the China Opera Company is to promote opera, so that every singer can have the opportunity to perform.</p>
<p>Opera originated in Italy, and Italy is also the most developed country. "La Traviata" composer Verdi is one of the most famous silent film writers in Italy. Italian music is light, subtle, and full of poetry. As for the story of "La Traviata", it has long been known to the Chinese people, and its touching plot is most suitable for the Chinese national character. Because of the above conditions, it has become the maiden performance of the China Opera Company. Although the lineup of actors is not entirely satisfactory, the greatest effort has been made.</p>
<h3>Forging</h3>
<p>— Xi Qiang</p>
<p>Friends!</p>
<p>We are like a piece of iron,</p>
<p>Time: a pile of fire,</p>
<p>Must be struck every day;</p>
<p>Must be sharpened often</p>
<p>Forged into iron:</p>
<p>Sharpened into a knife;</p>
<p>Friends! Remember</p>
<p>"It must be so..."</p>
<p>Everything we do will succeed.</p>
<h3>Creation</h3>
<p>— Han Feng</p>
<p>Human life can be said to be a kind of creative power, so it is by no means static, but rather active and positive. Its existence relies entirely on contact with matter, using it to create incessantly, so that the vitality of life can constantly develop; the content of life is also constantly advancing towards richness. Creation is the expansion of the power of life, and the content of life is creation. Losing creation means losing life. To put it plainly: "No creation, no life."</p>
<h3>From Manchuria to Shanghai (1)</h3>
<p>— Hashimoto Kansetsu</p>
<p>On the train on the Chosun Railway, I heard the person sitting opposite me say that there was a train to Chengde, so I immediately changed my itinerary to go directly to Beijing and got off in Jinzhou along the way. This route from Jinzhou via Chengde and Gubeikou to Beijing has only opened since the Incident. I originally wanted to visit Rehe, but I heard that from Jinzhou, I had to take a truck and be jostled on uneven roads for two or three days, so my interest waned. Now that there is a train, it is much more convenient.</p>
<p>After getting off at Jinzhou Station, I was unfamiliar with the place, so I prepared to go to a certain guest house designated by the travel agency at the station, but after leaving the station,</p>
<p>I looked for a rickshaw, and it was getting dark. I was wearing leather-soled straw sandals and carrying not-very-heavy bags in both hands, walking on the sandy road, which was difficult to walk on. When I got to the inn, I was almost refused, and it was only with great difficulty that I got to the second-floor room. It seemed that the treatment I received this time had changed. I have been to Manchuria dozens of times. Every time, there are things worth cherishing, but from the past to the present, nothing has changed. It is a kind of colonial atmosphere, a kind of dishonesty that floats like duckweed without roots. In Korea, you can see a firm and quiet attitude everywhere, but in Manchuria, everything seems to be unstable, as if it has not taken root. This seems like a regret to us people traveling abroad from our own country.</p>
<p>The impression I got from Jinzhou was like an old warehouse filled with broken cotton wool. Although there are modern buildings near the station, they are decorated, but they have no elasticity, and what catches the eye is a scene of decadence.</p>
<p>Early in the morning, I arrived in Chengde, and a sand rain was falling as I left the station. Wearing a kimono and leather-soled straw sandals on my feet, I felt extremely inconvenient. I originally thought that the place I had planned to stay would have a car to pick me up, but it was nowhere to be seen. Following the instructions of my fellow traveler, I called the lodging place to inquire, but they said the rooms were full and there was no room for me. That person looked around and heard people on the steps of the station talking about a local hotel, and I was overjoyed as if after a long drought. I unloaded my luggage here.</p>
<p>In the open space in front of the station, Manchurian soldiers and some Japanese soldiers gathered. Horses were loaded with food and weapons. After unloading their luggage at the hotel, they went about their business. At that time, the unpleasantness I had felt earlier disappeared, and my chest was relieved.</p>
<p>The Rehe Imperial Palace was not as impressive as I had imagined, but it seemed more elegant than the Northern Tomb of Fengtian. The Lama Temple, the so-called Eight Outer Temples of Rehe, is quite large in scale. It is rare to see in Central China. Old pines with gnarled trunks are everywhere, adding to the interest.</p>
<p>In the rain, at the entrance of the Puren Temple, I bought a few eggs from a roadside vendor and shared them with the driver. While carefully appreciating the surrounding scenery, my impression was filled with wartime scenery.</p>
<p>I thought the station hotel would be very noisy, but because there were very few trains coming and going, I hardly heard the whistle. It was much better mentally than staying in a mixed and restless inn. The service of the Manchurians here was also relatively cordial, and I slept soundly that night.</p>
<p>From Chengde to Gubeikou, it was my first time. Clusters of villages surrounded by ochre-peeling earthen walls could be seen everywhere. After the snow melted, the tender buds of willows swayed with a soft green color. I asked if there were pear trees with snow-white flowers, and although there were barbed wire and sandbags mixed among the East Four, I never felt like there was any sign of killing. It was truly a very good painting, and the impression was different from the impressions of previous trips to China. Especially the small stations in the mountains, hidden by 〇〇, with lambs wandering around, all these sceneries were unprecedented. I really wanted to get off in the middle of the road to sketch, because it was a fortress area. The train only passed once a day, and there was no place to stay, so I could only give up. I heard that this place is where the Communists haunt, but fortunately I had a permit, which I showed to the military police on the train. Taking advantage of the temporary stop, I left a coded sketch, hoping to pick up my pen when I remembered it in the future.</p>
<p>The Great Wall of Gubeikou has always been famous. Although it is very convenient to view the various scenery of the Great Wall, the scenery for painting is not enough, and some must be omitted. I think that the scenery from Juyongguan to Badaling is much better than here because there are more mountain gorges.</p>
<p>A person in the same room on the train, who claimed to be from Kyoto, was making wine in Mengjiang and said to me, "I want to send wine to your residence." We parted without exchanging names. After arriving in Beijing, someone sent two bottles of wine, and looking at the attached name card, I knew it was Mr. Sakurai.</p>
<p>The grapes of Mengjiang have been famous since ancient times. When I was young, there was a poem I loved to recite: "Grape wine in golden cups, pipa on horseback, urged under the moon." When I thought of the concluding sentence, "How many people have returned from ancient battles," I tasted the ancient expeditions and modern wars while appreciating the taste of the wine.

<h3>South City Almshouse Requests Donations from All Walks of Life</h3>
<p>The South City Almshouse has been established for forty years, housing single elderly men and women over the age of sixty. The quota is three hundred and fifty people. Nuns carefully care for their daily lives, so that they can live out their twilight years and fulfill their natural lifespan. According to a letter from the almshouse: This almshouse was founded by Catholic nuns, and the almshouse business has a hundred-year history in Europe. After completing their studies, the nuns all vow to abandon worldly affairs and spend their lives caring for poor and elderly people, and taking it as their duty to beg for alms. When people reach old age, they all want the care of filial sons and obedient grandsons. Unfortunately, they encounter misfortunes, lose their support, have no place to turn to in their old age, and have no way to make a living. The feelings of grief and pain cannot be borne by the old, and are indeed a constant occurrence in the world. The establishment of almshouses is intended to use an extraordinary spirit of love to act as sons and daughters for these lonely and dying elderly, hoping to slightly alleviate their suffering. The water courtyard has no servants or workers, and all the labor is undertaken by the nuns, such as cooking, washing, serving, and managing the household. They strive for cleanliness to meet hygiene standards, and after death, they are properly buried.</p>
<p>The almshouse has no foundation funds, and the annual operating expenses are entirely dependent on the nuns' personal daily alms-seeking. In the past, when times were good, it relied heavily on European aid and the support of benevolent compatriots. For forty years, it has never been interrupted and has often been able to develop and progress. Unfortunately, since recently, donors have either moved elsewhere or ceased operations. In particular, the large-scale donations that rely on major foreign firms and general societies are also difficult to obtain due to the vastly different market conditions. On the contrary, rice and firewood are expensive, and prices are soaring. The supplies needed by the population are on the verge of exhaustion. Therefore, the problem of living is very serious. If there is no source of continuous supply, how can we ensure their declining years? If they leave, they have no home to return to. Faced with these declining elderly people, we cannot bear to sit idly by and watch them starve to death. If we support them, we have no clothes or food, and life is getting harder every day. At this time of retreat, we really cannot bear to sit idly by. Considering the enthusiastic philanthropists from all walks of life, we are calling for their help to fulfill their loving responsibilities. In addition to earnestly hoping that our compatriots will donate generously, we also ask philanthropists to subscribe monthly to a certain amount, regardless of how much. The nuns will come to receive the fixed amount every month, or it can be transferred by the Shenbao. Shanghai South City Almshouse (Donations to the Almshouse can be collected here.)</p>
