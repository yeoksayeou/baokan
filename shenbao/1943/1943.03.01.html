<p>社評</p>
<h3>戰爭目的於勝利前途　讀德富豬一郎氏文書後</h3>
<p>日本權威政論家德富豬一郞氏，於二月十六日至十八日什東京每日新聞」發表其「從物質和精神兩方面來擊滅英美的戰爭」一文，（譯文見今日本報）對於目前世界戰爭中，敵方—英美所謂戰爭目的及其戰略中心，有正確的估計和批判。對於日本的作戰目的，有坦白的闡述；而對於日本作戰現階段的國際關係及其前途，也有懇切的說明。我們相信德富氏之作，不僅對日本　有極大的意義，就是作爲日本之盟國的我們中國人民，也是値得仔細誦讀的。因爲它可以掃除羅邱卡港會談後及會談時歐非戰報所給人們心上籠罩的暗雲，它再度給世界人士說明這次戰爭的眞實的內容和它的前途。</p>
<p>德富氏首氏指出大東亞戰爭的三個階段；即第一個階段是爲了日本帝國的自衛；第二個階段是爲了東亞諸民族的解放第三個階段是爲世界新秩序之建設。而且特別指出；「這三個階　，並不是各不相謀　，從平面的看來，是三位一體，從立體的看來，是三階一貫」。所以德富氏嚴正地說；「把這戰爭看做要獲得橡膠啦·錫啦·煤油·或是麻啦·糖啦·米啦·木材啦等等，是全然冒凟這次戰爭的」。因爲這「是戰爭的結果，而決非目的」。這種明白的解釋，將獲得東亞一切弱小民族之心底共嗚，而一般曲解大東亞戰爭目的的人士，這也是有力的答覆。不過，在我們中國人民的立塲，却不能以爲只要完全信賴日本得了，將來東亞民族之解放有我們的份，新世界秩序之建設有我們的份，不必自己奮鬭，日本會替我們代辦　不，這是極大的錯誤。日本第二及第三階段的戰爭目的之完遂，如果沒有我們中國人之積極的奮鬭，而只有消極的信賴，是決不可能的。在這　我們有喚起中日人民注意加强協力的必要。</p>
<p>英美作戰之真正的目的，在我門久受侵略的中國人民是最明瞭不過的了。德富氏所舉盎格魯撒克遜三個敵人，也正說中了英美帝國主義的心事；但是，我們覺得，除了德國、蘇聯和日本之外，英美還有第四個敵人，那就是久受他們侵略和壓榨之下的殖民地民族的解放遝動。從第二次世界大戰以來，英國在對德作戰中，首先喪失了一大盟邦—法國，和歐陸反德的一連串小國，英國始終不敢和德國展開正面的戰國。「歐洲第二戰綫」的口號喊出了兩年，在戰爭中，這是多麽悠長的期間啊；可是英美至今沒有在歐洲對德國開戰的勇氣。對蘇聯這個敵人？算是拉住了，眞如德富氏所說；「倘是沒有德蘇戰爭，恐怕倫敦早已成爲廢墟了，英國的所以能够暫獲舒息，簡直可以說是蘇聯的恩賜」。但是，英美所準備着的，却是「以怨報德」，這不是咒詛，而是事實。因爲，英美帝國主義者的對蘇畏懼是根本的，他們準備着適當的時機，隨時對於這一敵人作戰。而對於日本，英美是一戰而潰退三，在三大敵人之前，英美已不得不作事實上的低頭。但是，英美帝國主義者是抽吸殖民地民族之血而肥大起來的，當英美低頭於當面三大敵人之前，殖民地民族的覺醒於鬭爭，將是英美內心的畏懼所在。我們盼望全東亞的弱小民族在援助之團結與獨立運動中，儘更多的力量，那麼，繼南方各民族解放之後的印度獨立，將見英美帝國主義者總崩潰的日子了。</p>
<p>舊秩序總崩潰的日子愈加迫近，英美帝國主義者的掙扎也更劇烈，他們不僅已經首先向義大利引誘，而且還努力於離間日本和德國的友善關係；更進一步而挑撥日蘇之間的衝突，這種離間中傷和挑撥之計，自然，軸心國不會上當，就是日蘇之間也洞若觀火，決不會替英美帝國主義者從火中取栗的。但是在弱小民族中間，例如在對印度的內部之離間挑撥，以及對其他東亞民族之間的挑撥離間，都是値得我們作更嚴密的戒備。大東亞戰爭之第二階段，目的即爲東亞民族解放而戰，正在奮鬭進程之中。而第三階段的目的，即爲世界新秩序之建設，也將開始準備與推進，中日撤廢治外法權協定之實施，是戰爭目的之第一種證明。而中日之協力，也從這裏獲得更鮮明的啟示，東亞民族要以更緊密的互助與團結，粉碎英美離間挑撥的鬼計，進而根本消滅英美帝國主義者。最後勝利的信心應該堅定，但是勝利決不能坐待他人之餽贈。不勞而獲的果實，只能增加自己的羞愧。我們相信所有東亞民族都不願忍受羞愧而參加新時代的戰鬭。</p>
<h3>三次全教會議　昨日已圓滿開幕　參與代表均願實踐決議　共同負起戰時教育重任</h3>
<p>南京廿八日中央社電　昨日（廿八日）爲第三次全國敎育行政會議最後一日、上午九時開第三次全體會員大會、議長李部長推副議長蘇督辦主席、行禮如儀後、由秘書長楊次長報告、（一）出席會員、裴復恒、喬萬選、沈同良等九十六人、列席蘇雪軒等七人、（二）宣讀第二次全體會議記錄、（三）報告　收各方文件、計華北教育總署等機關、教育行政報告八　、繼即開始討論、（一）第二組高等教育組敎育行政及經費組、不再討論、（三）第四組社會敎育組、關於民衆敎育館、與靑年學校問題、有徐季敦、楊正宇、錢慰宗、兪義範、趙正平等、相繼發表意見、決議民衆敎育館、仍繼續辦理、並儘量設立靑年學校其他各案、照審查意見通過、（四）第五組其他組各提案、其中關於敎科書問題有樊仲雲、瞿孟鍇、邵鳴九、戴英夫、傳　棻等、相繼發表意見、均對現在環境體制下、敎育部於敎科書之編審印發四種工作以往之努力、深致欽佩、惟印發兩事、仍請敎育部力求打破事實上之困難、並應轉請敎部呈請行政院設立國營印刷公司、並希望敎科書編審之後、由部准許各書局自由印行、輾轉翻印、以應需要、其餘各案、均照審查意見通過、（五）討論大會宣言當將文字略加修正、一致通過、最後臨時動議、計有兩案、（一）先儘國立中學試行四二制案、經各會員反復討論、與其由多數國立學校做效果尙未可知之試騐、母寗由中央大學所屬實騐中學獨自先行試騐、結論咸以茲事體大、自宜審愼硏究辦理、當經決議本會議旣有學制課程委員會組織、議案通過在先、應將各會員意見整理後、備敎育部參考斟酌辦理、（二）之中心思想案、決義由提案人用書面送大會秘嚮處轉敎育部參考辦理。直至上午十一時四十分始全部討論完　、宣吿散會閉幕式、會員略事休息、即舉行閉會儀式、由議長李部長親自主席、開會奏樂、全體肅主席就位唱國歌、向國旗及國父遺像行最敬禮、主席恭讀國父遺囑、主席致閉會辭、旋由主席宣讀大會宣言、（另錄）於是成績圓滿結果豐富之第三次全國敎育行政會議、乃於軍樂鏗鏘聲中宣吿閉幕、</p>
<p>南京二十八日中央社電第三次全國敎育行政會議經三日來縝密商討、業於二十八日上午十一時圓滿閉幕、中國自參戰後、一切都入於戰時狀態、一切亦應適合戰時體制、故此次敎育行政會議之提案、雖有二百餘件、但歸納起來、其重心尤在於如何確立戰時敎育體制、以及改善敎育人員生活待遇等問題、關於確立戰時敎育體制、無疑的應實行新國民敎育、汪主席於開會時之訓詞中、亦再三昭示、盼全國敎育行政人員同心協力、促進新國民運動、因是參與會議各代表、均深切注意改革學制、以實踐新國民敎育之問題、而此問題亦得有圓滿之結果、關於其他敎育經費種種問題、均有縝密之詳盡商討、得有圓滿解決、而參與會議之各代表、自開會至閉會、其精神始終不渝、熱烈情况、實未會有、同時閉會後各會員亦再三聲言、返任後當努力實踐此次會議之決議、共同負起當前戰時敎育之重任、故本次會議收穫極爲重大、預料今後我國敎育、當更能適合戰時體制、而完成戰時敎育之責汗、</p>
<p>南京廿八日中央社電第三次全國敎育行政會議、業於廿八日上午圓滿閉幕、在主席除於廿六日開會時親臨會塲致訓外、並於本日下午七時以行政院長資格、假國際俱樂部歡宴各地出席代表、各地出席代表由李部長率領、均準時出席、一時情緒頗爲熱烈、至九時許始散、</p>
<p>全教會議發表宣言</p>
<p>南京廿八日中央社電第三次全國敎育行政會議、業於廿八日圓滿閉幕、特發表宣言如下敎恤為國家建設之基礎、亦立國之大本、國家盛衰與教育事業之關系至重日要、當此世界風蕓變化條忽之際、欲求生存、惟有艱苦　門力以赴、然後始能維護其生命於不墜、此種維護之日、實非教　無以造成之、且我中華民族五千年來所以能獨立自存、尤當歸攻於教育文化之力、是則教育事業之應亟謀發展、夫何　言、我國與學駸駸　年、事變以前敞未　於普及之境、事變以後教育事業更推毀殆盡、國府還都之六月本會舉行第一次會議、摭拾破殘、從事復興、翌年六月復開第二次會議、謀進一步之發展、華路籃縷、於茲三載、吾人本生聚敎訓之明訓、爲國家民族盡最大之努力、幸已規模　具、進步可期、此差堪吿慰於同胞者、敎育設施必吻合時代需要、方能發生預期之效果、以我國目前情勢叫論、正常敎育　應續謀發展、</p>
<p>而自大東亞戰爭發動以來、世界情勢爲之一變、我國爲　東亞解放之實現、旣已毅然決然宣　參戰、凡百事業均已入於戰時體制、則戰時敎育應如何設施、尤為今日所急需硏討者、本屆大會適於此偉大時代舉行、其意義自較一二兩　爲重要、吾人瞻望前途即具無限之欣幸、而今後責任之重大、尤不能不深自惕勵也、</p>
<p>本屆會議爲時雖　三日、對於敎育行政一敎育經費、高等敎育、普通敎育、社會敎育各部門、以及如何訓練靑年、如何改革學制、如何適應戰時體制等等均有詳盡之討論與決議、惟同仁於此尚有應爲全國敎育同志曁全國同胞吿者、爰述如次、敎育爲民族生命之所寄託、靑年爲國家建設之　部、欲建立　家之根本、維　民族生命、端　靑年之力量、故國家需要何種靑年敎育者、卽應培養　種靑年以供給之、今日潮流已充分表現、欲圖國族之生存、必賴全國人民之刻苦耐勞、勇猛精準、凡昔日靑年浮囂侈奢之風習、舉應廓而淸之、尤須了解際此非常時期、唯有以精神克服物、始不致墜入悲觀頹靡、所謂朝氣生氣即本此而生、本會對於敎育同仁之痛苦、固應極力謀可能之解決、同時我敎育同仁亦常堅苦卓絕、認定自身職責之重大、勿妄自菲簿、勿輒萌很志、此本會對全國同仁所懇摯期待者也、</p>
<p>敎育爲社會事業之一、一方面爲改進社會之原動力、一方面更賴社會之督責扶持而達釗自身之改進、然國人對之雖明瞭其重要、而不　爲急務、此實同仁等最感苦悶而不容已於言者、自我國宣佈參戰以來、政府已再三訓示施政方針、着重增加生産與保障治安兩、夫此兩者皆必以教育為其實施之基本、蓋欲增加生產、首須造就生產人才、欲保障治安、首須擁正思想、本會議對於生產教育、青年訓練、再三討論、決　至多、殆可見全國國人均已感到此數事之不可稍緩、而吾人所呼籲於國人之前者、即要求社會對教育力量加以重新估定、予以有力之督促與扶持、則教育與社會庶可打成一片、而教育事業進一歩之發展、殆即於社瞻之、。</p>
<p>敎育之效能除制度方法等問題外、端在以身則夫子之未至於善也、則又焉能責人以善、昔在漢宋士氣、為萬流宗仰此無他、要唯有健身行事堪資規模有以致之、近日學風之敝、豈革靑年本身之責、領導者殊亦難辭厥咎、當此舉國厲行新國民運動之時我敎育同仁自應　禀卽操、作爲型狀、　聲氣所樹、有如草上之風、而後靑年置身社會、不唯不致陷於沈淪、抑且可以領導全體民衆、是本會對敎育同仁之又一期待也、</p>
<p>强化敎育乃國家命脈、凡我同胞無不知之、然在戰爭殘破之後、失學人數之衆、恐有出乎意料之外者、倘不急起補救、危險孰甚、唯是經濟問題萬方一致、靡不感覺拮据、顧因噎廢食、昔人所譏、吾人處此環境、唯有在可能範圍中努力作去、爲國家多造就一識字之人、即多增一分元氣、同時無論中央各當局亦必竭誠以赴、絕對避免敷衍塞責之態度、此因不僅義敎一端、即其他問題何獨不然、不過義敎關係最巨、故本會對地方敎育經費曾有最切實之決議、希望各地當局深體斯旨、對此事極力維持、則不唯本會之所企盼、亦全國人民所企盼也、爲政貴在實事求是、本會同仁尤嚴守此訓、凡已決各案、當力求實現、以免徒託空言　蹈覆轍、况比次聚全國敎育同志於一堂、意見之溝通交換、事實之討論硏究、在在皆有表現團結一致之現象、深願同仁等本此種精神在領袖指導之下、遵照中樞旣定方針、適應時　需要、努力本位工作、以發揮敎育之最大力量、本會幸甚、國家幸甚、</p>

<h3>德國總力戰態勢　全民動員齋向勝利目標邁進</h3>
<p>— 朝日新聞特派員守山</p>
<p>（柏林廿發）德國的「後方戰綫」，近來與前綫的戰爭相呼應，勞働者，一般市民，都咬牙切齒埋頭苦幹。德國自占領烏克籣之後，原擬使平時工業復活，準備進入長期戰體制，以期後方的生活得有喘息的機會，故統制方面會一度弛緩，茲則一反上述的預期，嚴萬的去令，每日在「官廳事項」中發表，國民門今日至領券事務所，明日至勞動局，忙得不亦樂乎。「國難臨頭」，「竭全部國力從事戰爭」！「勞慟力總動員」！「總力戰的時期來了」！等呼聲，在無綫雷與新聞中大聲疾呼，恰如遠在數千里外火綫上的砲聲，傳入柏林人們的耳中，使生活緊張起來。</p>
<p>有組織的國有</p>
<p>歌舞在歡的相棘後方市街，因斯達林格勒的悲劇而寂然無聲了。市民們所迸發的愛國熱情，也因前幾天政府方面相繼發表的「男女勞慟申請令」，「商店停閉令」，而被統制了。危局臨頭，所有一切個人的和平的動態，都被視爲次要的。而在政府統制下，開始了後方全國民的勞慟總動員。祇要是德意志人，都服從這命令，而充分的顯示出愛國的熱誠，幾千萬人民，一致默然無聲向政府所指示的方向進行。戰事經過三年半之後的現在，芷有極大的轉變，用第三者冷靜的眼光來看，實是一幅極凄慘的悲壯圖畫。歐洲的戰事正在轉變中，借希特勒的話來說：「與其抱殘守闕，母寧死滅。」最後的決戰舞台，快出現了。假使德國不能波過這苦難的危局，則世界新秩序的夢想，新歐洲的計劃，即德意志民族的本身，都將墮入無底的深淵，永刦不復翻身。這情形很淸楚的擺在各人面前，所以勞慟者的神態，都帶着一種很悽慘的景象，抱着必死的決心而奮團。戈培爾，希姆萊，芬克，查開爾等幹部們，最近的活動，都懷着納粹黨苦行時代的堅信的熱忱，而成爲目前德國大轉變中的推進力。</p>
<p>徵集女子勞働力</p>
<p>上述二種非常時的法令，根本改變了德國一般的後方生活，社會生活，乃至家庭生活的表情。這變革都會比農村更甚。一週的工作不超過四十八小時以上者極少。此外，男子自十六歲至六十五歲，女子自十七歲至四十五歲，全部都不能不在本月中至勞働局投效。所以，自三月一日起，根據這投效，第一，完全沒有工作的男女；第二，四十歲以下未生育的女子；第三，一週工作時間不滿四十八小時的男女，依序分配至軍需工塲及其他勞役中工作。</p>
<p>凡是勞慟力不　的處所，都可以由此獲得了數百萬人的補助勞慟力。迄今爲止，所有的男子幾完全被徵，從事各種戰時的勤務，所以這一法令所能徵集的僅爲尙殘存於民間的女子勞働力。凡女子無一個六歲以下的孩子，或二個十四歲以下的孩子者，不問其爲寡婦或離婚者，亦不問其爲陣亡將士的遺族，或出征軍人的妻子，全部都須服勞役。當然，孕婦可以免除這勞役。換句簡明的話說來，德國的女子，被國法命令「於孩子或工塲二者中抉擇其一」。</p>
<p>不勞働者不得食</p>
<p>歐洲有閑的太太們特別多，但都被戰爭消滅了，就使有閑階級中小康的寡婦們，今後在德國亦將絕跡。爲防止逃避服役，凡無勞慟局方面「該氏曾經申請」之証明盡者，食繼領券所將不給予下月份的糧食券，於是任令想畫方法隱進，也不能不向勞働局投效。</p>
<p>「不勞慟者，不得食」的原則，即爲最澈底的德國式的方法，使國內無不勞而食，及不生產的浪費人，此爲戰爭第四年的德國總力戰態勢。</p>

<p>此次徵集的女性，所任工作，與男子完全無區別。汽車，電車，和地下鐵道的車長，自開戰時起巳漸成爲女子的工作。售票員也都是女子，偶然有一男性車長發現，即覺得奇怪。所以向來祇有男子才能担任的鑛山工作，近來也有女子參加，多墩的軍需工塲，金屬工塲及化學工塲等，女子職工數也漸凌駕男子職工數之勢，因爲生產技術方法的進步，故有許多部門現在女子都可以勝任。據最近報上所載全國的平均統計，化學工塲中，男與女之比爲一〇〇對五五，（戰前爲三五）橡膠工塲爲一〇〇對八二之比，（戰前爲六穴）造紙廠爲一〇〇對一四一之比。此次勞慟力總動員的結果，被徵至戰綫的男于勞慟者，預期將全由女子補充。男子在前綫作戰，女子在後方造彈，男女職務範圍，將有很大的變更。</p>
<p>享受「休假」的妙法</p>
<p>戰時德國的女子，不再是爲出征男子看守家庭的妻子了。現在已可以當她是後方戰綫的兵士，直接參加戰事了。</p>
<p>於是發生了「休假」的問題。前綫出征的將士，在一定期內，與以歸鄕的機會，特地回鄕的將士，假使因妻子因夜勤而不在家，「休假」豈非徒然嗎？於是想出了使「休假」將士不悲觀的方法，由聯隊長發給男子「准予休假一星期」的證明書，這紙證明書，可以使在公司及工廠中服役的妻子從勞働義務中解放的權利。這一種德國非常時中的非常時，假使與日本的厚生大臣在議會上所答辯的「女子的義務勞慟制今尙無必要」，比較起來，可見日本的國力，尙很充裕。</p>
<p>八萬家商店打烊</p>
<p>芬克財長所發表的「商店停閉令」，至三月十五日止，命令業經指定者停止業務。完全實施之後，後方一般市民的生活將有很大的變化。這是與上述「勞慟申請令」相呼應的措置，第一，停閉戰時不必要的業務，其目的在微用勞慟力。停閉的商店中之打字機和電話，也可以移作軍用，空閑的房屋，充作軍需勞慟者的宿舍，百貨店可改造成醫院，因商販减少，職務上的旅行及貨物運輸自然也减少，而鐵道車輛乃可以移作軍用。據德國報紙的記載，因戰爭而自行停閉的商店有八萬家，全國尙存商店六十萬家，因此次法令而被停止營業的商店不知應有多少，然停閉的範圍則漸趨擴大，結果僅存的將祇有食料品關係與日常必需品的商店。</p>
<p>例如烟紙店最初擬停閉百分之七十至八十，而發賣有一定品質的「統一紙烟」。又中小商工業者的業務停止後，這些業務所需要的郵政，運輸，與電力等亦可以得到非常的節約，這一措置，將使全國健全的中產階級大爲减少。極端的說來，在德國社會中，除戈培爾所說的「最上層有產階級一萬人」之外，將僅有勞慟者與統制勞働者的官吏二種人，德國的這一事實，在與社會主義共產制度的蘇聯，進行生死的鬥爭中，爲最堪注意的一點。</p>
<p>德國報紙的社評上說：「商店的經營在視覺的心理影響上加以考慮的時代，早已過去了。」讀此可以明瞭戰時德國的景况。德國商店的櫥窗所陳列的承平時代的商品，祇是爲了視覺的心理的影響而佈置的窓飾，沒有出賣的意義，所以勸吿停業。這一種捨棄虛飾而坦白表現的傾向，爲最近德國的戰爭指導方針上最根本的大變革。此業已由德國國內宣傳政策的轉變爲其光導，自一月下旬以來，德國國內的宣傳方針，使國民獲悉時局的眞相。</p>
<p>學問也集中於戰爭</p>
<p>娛樂，消遣等後方日常生活，儘可能的維持平時狀態，不使國民爲了戰爭而疲倦，這一方針已成過去了。深刻的戰時狀態，使德國的大學中也改變了「學問自由」的態度，據最近黨的學生指導本部發表，現在的大學生不應冉徒然玩弄哲學的玄虛了，學問亦應限於戰時緊急的科目。關於戰時大學生的任務等，另有特別法令公布。</p>
<p>學者開的爭辯，爲學間而學問等硏究態度，都受到警吿。大學的硏究，集中於遂行戰爭上所必要的直接科目，閱讀不必要的講義，浪費掉即將出發至戰塲的有爲學生們的時間，减損德國的戰鬥力，所以大學制度祗存醫科與工科爲中心，而實施戰時改革。捨棄一切的虛飾，坦白地傾國家全力與「戰爭」決鬥，此爲今後德國一切施政的出發點。（翔：譯自二月二十二日東京朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>唯一不貴的東西—薪水</h3>
<p>百物飛漲，已成爲時人的談助，但是不貴的也有，這就是薪水。</p>
<p>南京市職工總會，在去年十二月裏調查過華人勞工的工資，據說連膳食在內，最高的是搬運石頭的小工，平均每天九元。最低是飮食店的伙計，每天不過一元二角，　通在四元左右，你想這種生活，何等清苦，上面的數目是以中　劵計算，至年末獎賞和其他賞錢，並不在內，是每一天的固定收入。</p>
<p>根據統計，最高工價是運石工人，其次是油漆匠，最高七元三角，共他都在六元以下。西服效縫六元九角，製　皮箱工人六元七角半，理髮業六元七角，木匠六元二角半，汽車司機五元二角，皮匠五元一角半，機織業四元四角，這些已算是中上的薪工了。</p>
<p>此外還有更低的工資，銀匠三元七角半，榮隊三元二角半，旅館茶房三元，茶工三元，馬軍夫三元，敎販二元五角，軋米廠小工二元四角，骨董工人二元五角，中服裁縫二元二角半，紙紮工二元，荳儲店工人二元，印刷業工人二元七角，廚子二元一角，浴室堂倌二元四角，酒店堂倌二元三角，點心店伙計二元六角，銅匠二元六角，大多數是這樣子，再小的還有熱水業的伙計一元三角五分，皮件製造業一元七角，飲食店伙計一元二角，中國的習償上，副收人會超過　水，所以上面不能說是生活費收人的總數，可是正式薪水祗有這點數目，淸苦的生活是可以想見了。（任：譯自二月二十七日大陸新報）</p>

<h3>友邦人士的期望　日本實踐對華新政策之後</h3>
<h3>我愛中國</h3>
<p>— 武內文彬</p>
<p>「如果僅就上海的枯燥環境和沉悶空氣來觀察，那末，直要使人對中國的眞芷面目表示懷疑。其實中國有着蜿蜓五千浬的長江，萬里長城，還有那發源於靑海巴顏喀喇山畏流到渤海的黄河，這些大自然都足以證明數千年來中國歷史的悠久，使人不得小懷慕這種大自然的偉大。」</p>
<p>以上這段話，是畢生　瘁於硏究中國問題的武內文彬氏所說的。他在靑年時代，曾經遍歷中國，作實地考察，一度歸國後又來中國。現任上海白本商議所常務理事。</p>
<p>他又說：「我在大正十一年，三十多歲的時候，到過重慶。先從漢口到宜昌，經過萬縣，留宿一宵，翌日傍晚到達了重慶，看見了諸葛孔明的遺　白帝城，那一種幽美的景象，直至如今還使我留戀不忘。趁小舟向上行，經過宜昌峽，巫山峽，風霜峽的三峽之險，河流的兩旁，邎崖絕壁，美麗的紅葉，大隊的羔羊，令人欣賞不盡，這裏的天然美景，決不是一枝筆，一幅畫能够形容得出的，所以歷代的文人，就用千變萬化的文字來描寫這山峽之險，那種人世絕景，不得不投筆叫絕。」</p>
<p>武內氏是一個識見超羣。同時，主張不背現實的人，他認爲人生的處理事務，如果玩弄小智，是不中用的，萬事應該順從自然，合乎宇宙間的法則。</p>
<p>武內氏認爲這次日本新政策的根據，也得要在這一點上着手。因爲日本的轉換對華政策和毫不躊躇的實踐，促使重慶政權，感覺到苦悶與徬徨距離末日已經小遠。武內氏在這裏又想起了當初和蔣介石會見的情形。</p>
<p>「我會見蔣介石，是在他北伐完畢，到上海來的時候。和他一席談話之中，看他那種爽快的回答，好像頗有自信力，但是他給我的印象，覺得他不像統帥，是相當於參謀長的人材，現在他已成爲東亞的叛徒，何以會弄到這個地步呢？最大的原因，還是英美在幕後作票，同時深受了美國誘惑的宋氏一門，不絕地從旁煽動，遂致和美國結了不解緣。但是，蔣介石曾留學過日本，他很明瞭日本的强盛，也很尊徵日木的精神，明知和日本打下去，是有敗無勝的，可是利用地大物博的步步後退戰略，總在他腦海裏盤旋不休。」</p>
<p>武內氏在最後的結論中，極力强調上海經濟界人士的使命重大，他說：</p>
<p>「愛日本者，唯有愛中國，才有指導建設東亞共榮圈的資格。近代戰爭的主旨，是一面戰爭，一面樓設，而且國府的加强力量，注重於復興經濟，從這幾點來觀察，上海不但是中國的經濟中心，就在地理上也是共榮圈的中心地點，所以上海經濟界人士所負的使命，非常重大。」（雲鵬：譯自二月二十五日大陸新報）</p>
<h3>深願中國民衆　發揚國家意識</h3>
<p>— 林出賢次郞</p>
<p>林出賢次郞氏，僑居中國巳有四十二年之久，昔年曾任天皇陛下通譯官，後來調任南京領事，北京大使館一等書記官等職，週遊過世界各國，現任東亞同文書院大學學監，他很盼望中國民衆，個個有國家意識。他說：</p>
<p>「我靑年時代，在新疆省天山北路王省長的家裏住過，和王氏家庭共飲食起居有二年之久，後來我在北京招待王氏的孫兒王嘉亨君，住在我的寓所，我接王君來住，毫無作用。我很坦白對他，善則養，惡則惡，凡是他不能辨認是非的時候，不客氣的隨時訓責糾正他。當他歸去的時候，他對家人說林出老伯眞是個好人，像他這樣熱情的好人，是沒有第二個的。因爲我的訓責他是善意的，沒有半點私心的在起居勵作上做榜樣給他着。」</p>
<p>「英美人常把華人輕視，認爲是劣等民族，不如他們優秀，但是日本所發動的大東亞戰爭，是實踐道義的戰爭，膺　叛徒重慶，把這件事的性質小比一下，在精神上不是和我訓責王嘉享君的意思一樣嗎？大東亞戰爭的目的，是要求東亞全民族的獨立解放，以國家協同體的地位共存共榮。所以，和英美的侵略思想完全相反，中國雖然有很多的偉大人物，富有民族觀念，但是我希望全中國人要使進一步發揚國家意識和了解大東亞戰爭的意識。</p>
<p>現在新中國已經恢復主權，那末對於國家大事，僅是一部份知識階級關心是不够，必須全民共同關心，這是我對於轉換期中，對於中國民族的忠實良言。」林出氏講到這裏，又回想到昭和初期旅行世界的情景，感慨地說：</p>
<p>「隨便到那一國，那一地」，小孩總是可愛的，青年都有勇氣的，女郎尤覺可愛，不端方和虛偽，誰都感覺討厭，誠懇和正直，一定叫人愉快，能够動人而人爲所動的，就是誠意。「中國有一句名言「誠之所至，金石爲開。」可見得「至誠」是何等偉大。」</p>
<p>最後林出氏又說：偉大的國家，他的國民，必須要有淸萬的品格和國家意識（任雲鵬：譯自二月二十八日大陸新報）府方面特誌贈紀念品銀盾十四具、市警察局樂隊特蒞塲奏樂外、中華電影公司派員在壞拍攝新聞片、</p>

<h3>南洋各地特輯之五　東印度滄桑記　（一）</h3>
<p>— 喬松</p>
<p>（一）東印度概況</p>
<p>舊荷屬東印度，是太平洋沿岸火山帶的一部份，島形很不規則，海底的深淺，海岸的曲折，都極複雜。各島大致多山，火山尤多。爪哇一島，火山共有一百零九座之多。其中以士美路峯最高，拔海達三千六百五十八公尺，終年噴火。爪哇和蘇門答臘間的喀拉喀托火山島，在一八八三年爆發時，幾乎全島被炸成薤粉，爆炸聲遠傳到澳洲一帶。平原多在沿海地方，如蘇門答臘東岸，爪哇北岸，婆　洲西南岸都是。河流以婆羅洲的卡浦斯河，巴利托河較長大，別的都很細小。</p>
<p>東印度羣島，幾乎都在赤道下，氣候常年如夏，很少變化，但因四面環海，所以也不十分使人數得難受。閘量的分配，赤道以北五月到九月爲雨季，餘時爲乾季，赤道以南的情形相反。赤道恰好把東印度羣島從中切開了，但一般的都很潮濕。季候風的影饗不少，牠在赤道地帶創出了不相應的，乾燥的及潮濕的週期對比，對於農作，由於爾水量降落的不規則性，常常引起危險，所幸有不少河流，在季候風的雨水期，河面充分擴大了，成爲液溉及水力的重要來源。</p>
<p>從政治區劃來看，舊荷屬東印度，位於亞洲大陸的東南，從北緯六度至南緯十一度，東經九五度至一四一度間，包括所有島嶼。大體上可分下列羣島：</p>
<p>（一）大巽他羣島：蘇門答瞰，爪哇，婆羅洲（一部份），西里伯斯；</p>
<p>（二）小巽他羣島：巴里，龍目（浪波克），松巴瓦，佛羅里，松巴（三多爾烏得），帝汶（一部），占的拿，塞波；</p>
<p>（三）摩鹿加羣島；哈瑪希拉（濟羅羅），鄂碧（望比拉），布魯，西蘭，安汶，蘇刺，密梭羅，外維，班達，新幾內亞（西半）。</p>
<p>西起蘇門答獵，東至新幾內亞，總面積共爲一，九〇西，三四五·七平方公里（一九三七年調查），距離比我國從上海至塔城（新疆）還要遠，大於荷蘭本國五十八倍，大於日本本部八倍，占全赤道九分之一。</p>
<p>東印度的人口，據一九三〇年十月七日調查，爲六千零七十二萬七千二百三十三人，每一平方公里的人口密度，不過三一·九一人，如加入迄未有確實調查的新幾內亞，則其密度當更稀疏。而人口之七〇％集居於爪哇及馬都拉，該區人口密度達三一五，六三人，其他外領則相常於一〇，七三人而已。爪哇及馬都拉與外領各州面積，人口及密度如下表：（單位面積一平方公里，人口及密度一人）</p>
<p>新幾內亞全島面積爲七四四·三六二平方公里，其中荷屬新幾內亞之面積爲三八二·一四〇平方公里。</p>
<p>東印度的土著民族是馬來族，約占總人口的九七·三八％，外僑以華僑爲最多，有一百二十餘萬，次爲歐突人及其他東方民族。歐美人中又以荷蘭人爲最多，而荷人中又以荷人與馬來人的混血人佔多數，茲將一九三〇年調查之種則人口列如下：</p>
<p>日本人佔七四·（〇〇〇人。</p>
<p>（二）政治形勢</p>
<p>東印度之成爲歐美人的殖民地，已有悠久的痛史。自從西班牙無敵艦隊戰敗以後，荷蘭殖民者首謀開擴東方謀利之途一五九六年荷人霍脫曼（Cornelius　Houtman）率艦四艘，繞非洲好望角到達蘇門答臘及萬丹，和爪哇的氏族社會的酋長締結「親善」條約一五九八年，荷人續遺遠征隊至東印度，在爪哇柔佛等處設立商業機關，組織公司一六〇二年，成立了東方殖民史上最著名的荷蘭東印度公司（DutchEast　InaiesCo．），這一年，又以武力驅逐萬丹的葡萄牙人，設立商行，開闢摩鹿加通路。一六〇三年，又以艦隊封鎖葡人在印度的根據地臥兒，同時在菲律賓海面襲擊西班牙船隻？數經戰爭，終于一六〇六年在摩鹿加獲得根據地。十年之後，遂樹立其香料島與馬來羣島的地位。後二年，又在爪哇建立巴達維亞城，爲日後荷屬東印度的首府。一六二三年，　　英　離東印度而專力於印度之經略。—六五二年，荷人更乘中國明末內亂之際，進佔台灣。一六四一年，又攻佔葡人經營已久的麻刺甲，結束了葡人經略東亞的歷史。一六五二年，荷人已殖民於好望角，建立連絡東方的基地。一六五八年攻佔葡人的錫蘭，同時伸展其通商路綫至日本和中國各地。當時荷蘭船舶往來於南洋海面的，數達一萬六千艘之多，把握一時「海洋之王」的覇權。</p>
<p>荷蘭人當時對東方的經略，主要在乎貿易權，也就是用欺騙恐嚇等手段底極少的本錢，搜刮土人的一切物資，獲得最大的利潤，使這些殖民者過着窮奢極侈的生活。還沒有建立殖民地帝國的野心。因此，他們所佔土地，一如葡萄牙人，　祇限於沿海一帶，對於土著民編，祗知掠奪與誘騙貨物，不知開發內地，展開政治及文化的殖民工作，所以基礎不深，一逢强敵，即有崩潰之處，如在十八世紀末，十九世紀初，拿破崙在歐洲稱覇，而荷蘭本部爲法所併呑之時，南洋一帶的荷蘭殖民地，每受英人襲擊，即全部淪陷於英軍，直　拿破倫　亡後，英國治以爪哇歸還荷人，一八二四年又以蘇門答臘交換麻刺甲，荷蘭在南洋的殖民地才算保全。到了十九世紀以後，荷蘭本國的經濟有了顯著的變化，殖民地政策有了新的轉變，就開始對馬來羣島進行近代化的殖民工作，利用賤價的土者勞工，强迫土人種植橡樹，咖啡，甘蔗等，展開了更慘酷的對殖民地的壓榨。</p>
<p>荷蘭王任命總督，統治東印度，總督又稱副王，賦有絕大權限。總督任期，如無特別規定，通例爲五年。其權限分立法仃政司法大體如下：</p>
<p>（一）立法：總督制定的總督令及政府條令，照例要得國民參議的討論通過，如已爲國民參議院裁可而爲總督所小同意的法案，則奏請荷蘭國王。但事實上國民參議院不過是一個諮詢機關而已。參議院的議長由國王任命，議員三十八名，由總督任命及地方議會選出，出期四年。不過荷蘭人，土人，華僑及阿拉伯人皆有被選任議員的機會。</p>
<p>（二）行政：總督爲荷　東印度的最高行政機關，由最高諮詢機關的荷印評議院輔佐之，　有　大的行政　。</p>

<h3>從物質和精神兩方面擊滅英美的戰爭</h3>
<p>— 德福豬一郎原著</p>
<p>（一）戰爭目的之三階段</p>
<p>我們爲什麼戰？現在雖然沒有再發這個愚問的必要，可是，「追鹿的獵人不見山」，我們熱中於戰爭，不無有忘掉其本來目的之虞。那末，我們實有高揭這個問題，而深思遠慮和切行的必要。因爲這個緣故，所以我們當局，把頒發大詔的一天，就是月之八日，作爲其紀念日，使得國民深自警覺。我們一方面須得向世界表明戰爭的目的，使療然於這戰爭的萬不獲已；另方面，須得問問自巳的良心，有沒有盡着皇國臣民的本分而提供其全心全力？</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭的目的，有三個階段：第一，是爲了皇國日本的自衛；第二，是爲了東亞諸民族的解放；第三，是爲了世界新秩序的建設。這三個階段，並不是各不相謀的，從平面的看來，是三位一體；從立體的看來，是三階一貫。</p>
<p>現在雖然沒有再把戰爭的起因等加以穿鑿的必要。但是，要曉得我們決不是自己高興投入於這戰爭的漩渦中的。我們是儘所可能努力於用着和平手投，解決一切糾紛；爲了和平的緣故，極願爲可以臻於妥協的極度交讓的。然而那美國——其背後當然有英國存在着——却把我們無可奈何地趕上了戰爭的一條路上。</p>
<p>它的顚末，現在沒有再來贅述的必要。總之，他們要把日本像罐頭般地密封得連一點兒氣也吁不出來。最初布成ABCD經濟的包圍陣綫，要把我們吃癟。其次，用武力壓迫，要不戰而使我們屈服。最後，向我們要求從中國撤兵，不承認滿洲帝國，不承認南京政府而只承認重慶政府；要求放棄三國同盟而復歸於九國公約</p>
<p>事情已經到了這個地步，即使是一個怎樣崇拜英美的人，也只有死心塌地打斷念頭，何况是有常識的皇國男兒呢！並且，使得我們慨然挺身而起的，不單是日本的生死存亡的問題，而是我東亞十一億民族的生死存亡的問題。我們要是一度屈服於英美的命令，那麼十一億的東亞諸民族，恐怕永遠沒有再見天日的機會，現在再放大眼光，一看全世界，那盎格魯撒克遜民族的橫暴，是簡直要把世界二十餘憶的人類，恰像三億餘的印度人那樣完全做着他們的奴隸！要是一任他們爲所欲爲，那麽全世界一定要淪爲最黑暗的活地獄，是毫沒有疑惑餘地的。我們的　國，——德國，意大利，在歐洲對於盎格魯撒克遜人稱覇世界的野心，所以不惜賭其勝敗的命運於一擲，也決不是偶然的。</p>
<p>如上所述，我們戰爭的目的，首爲自己，次爲東亞，而終及於全世界的。這三個階段，是用着我皇道日本的大羲一以貫之。所以，把這戰爭看做：要獲得橡皮啦，錫啦，煤油啦，或是麻，糖啦，米啦，木材啦等，是全然冒凟這戰爭的。此等是戰爭的結果，而決非目的。</p>
<p>（二）英美的所謂戰爭目的</p>
<p>我們向着英美兩國的秉權者羅斯福和邱吉爾敢問：「你們爲着什麽理由硬要和日本戰爭」？他們所謂戰爭目的，到底是什麽？世界上最會得花言巧語的，沒有比得上盎格魯撒克遜民族的。他們對於無論什麽事情，總會說出相當的理由，所謂「賊强盜也有三分理」，就是他們的形容。然而，他們對於這戰爭的目的，却說不出什麼確切的理由來，不但對於敵人，就是對於自己國民，也還是這樣弄得他們莫名其妙，這不可不說是近來一件極其奇怪的現象。</p>
<p>當然他們決不是全然沈默的。從昭和十六年（一九四一年）八月九日起，歷十一天之久，在大西洋中現在爲馬來海中之藻屑的英戰艦威爾斯親王號上羅邱的第一次會談，宣言所謂大西洋憲章八項，向世界聲明戰後的經綸。這恰如威爾遜在第一次世界大戰時所宣示的十四項同樣，完全打着一相情願的如意算盤。這種空頭支票，連他們自己國裏的人民，尙還有着「痴人說夢」之感。</p>
<p>嗣後，他們所發關於戰爭目的之話，只是舉着諸民族的解放哪，人種平等的確立哪，諸凡和實際十分緣遠的空漠問題，爲一時瞞人眼目之計。若是眞要把諸民族解放，以及人種平等之確立等問題，付諸實施，那麽何以不把它適用之於美國國內一千六百萬的黑種人呢？何以不把它適用之於三億的印度人民呢？像這樣忘記了脚下的現實而一味寫着架空的契約，是他們的拿手好戲，可是誰來相信呢？尤其是像羅斯福把這戰爭稱之爲「爲了生存的戰爭」，更是一無道理。不把日本當做罐頭，還在什麽地方找得到滅亡美國的理由呢？</p>
<p>他們原是喊着自由，喊着民主的，可是我們要問他們果眞是自由國嗎？果眞是民主國嗎？英美有世界上自由主義的老家之稱，英國又以自由主義的莊家自任。可是有識人士，却常常這樣說：「英國是有自由的，可是這自由，只有少數的大地主階級，所謂紳士階級所獨有。他們雖然有着一切的自由，可是他們以外，在英國國裏，誰也享不到自由。」史家說道：「在法蘭西，國王握着政權；在西班牙，敎士握着政權；在英國，紳士階級握着政權。那曾經簽字於大憲章的約翰王，自己嘆着氣說，在我的上面，還有二十五個太上王。」所謂二十五個太上王，就是指那强逼約翰王簽字於大憲章的二十五人所組織的委員會，爲一切政治的諮詢機關。</p>
<p>現在英國的政權，已經從土地的所有者手裏，轉移到那輩由工業革命發生的大資本家的手裏，雖其幾分之幾更轉移到一部分的勞工的手裏，然而英國自身，並不是自由國，是很明白可睹的。至於美國，金錢萬能，在金錢以外，無論什麽地方，是找不出自由來的。</p>
<p>現在假定我們和英美戰爭，萬一敗北了，那麽在締結媾和條約的時期，他們會提出什麽條約來課諸我們呢？那可說不定。然而在去年五月三十日，美國的南北戰爭紀念日，副國務卿薩姆那威爾士的演說，列舉戰爭的目的如下：</p>
<p>（一）處罰戰爭責任者的個人，集團，及國民。</p>
<p>（二）在戰後設立相當長久的休戰期間，共間以行撤廢侵略國的軍備。</p>
<p>（三）在保持和平的永久機構之確立以前，美國和其與國，維持並行使國際警察力。</p>
<p>（四）戰後，在完畢經濟問題，社會問題的處理之後，設立以美國和其與國爲基礎之國際組織，徐徐決定和平的最終條件。</p>
<p>（五）對於戰後世界秩序的建設。美國應當作爲指導者。</p>
<p>（六）汎美機構，應加以繼續，（以上據來栖大使的報吿）</p>
<p>如果眞的照這樣實行，那麽我們便必須負擔比諸第一次世界大戰後的德國，還要加上一百倍的屈辱和苦痛，所以，就拿這一件事說，我們是非戰勝不可的。最近那個副國務卿又演說道：「我們美國人，爲了保持自己的自由和獨立而戰；爲了戰敗那些欲以暴力和不信行爲來支配世界之一類壓制者而戰」。但是我們要問有什麽人敢來破壞美國的自由和獨立的？這自由和獨立的破壞者，就是美國自己。拿着火把來到處放火，使全世界陷於水深火熱的禍亂之中，也就是他們自己。</p>
<p>（三）盎格魯撒克遜的三個敵人</p>
<p>盎格魯撒克遜民族的慣習，常把比自己優越者，或是將要凌駕自己者，或是和自己比肩者，當做敵人，而一以給他當頭棒爲務。這原是有計劃的，因爲習與性成，現在差不多可以看做他們之本能的行爲了。在現代，給英美兩國當做敵人的，第一是德國，第二是日本，第三是蘇聯（在其以前爲俄羅斯帝國）。</p>
<p>第一個敵人的德國，在第一次世界大戰，已被解決掉了。其戰塲只局限於法國和比國，在英國內地受不到什麽損害。但是爲了這回戰事，從來爲世界之債權者的英國，變了債務者，世界財政的覇權，從倫敦那兒，給紐約奪去了。在第一次世界大戰的當兒，發了財的是美國；英國却不得不切感着那所謂戰勝者的悲哀。第二個敵人日本，曾經締結日英同盟，其結果使日本和俄國戰爭，兩虎相鬭，非死即傷，使盎格魯撒克遜大稱心願。可是日本却隨着第一次大戰抬起頭來，爲欲加以制伏，英美乃同於一九二二年二二月的華盛頓會議，達成了他們的目的。第三個敵人蘇聯，於第一次世界大戰後，爲欲加以撲滅，用盡了種種手段，終於不能達到目的而輟手。</p>
<p>嗣是以後，世界並不依着盎格魯撒克遜民族的希望而進向，却爲其反對的逆轉，曾經被其打倒了的德國，又復興起來了。而且使德國復興的，盎格魯撒克遜也與有助力。那就是因着英國之同盟國的法國，於第一次世界大戰後，迅速恢復了元氣，糾合歐洲諸小國而自爲盟主，於是乎盎格魯撒克遜人的老脾氣發出來了爲欲對於法國的得勢加以掣肘而遽向德國伸其同情之手。使得德國復興的，是盎格魯撒克遜的資本；這實情，德國人比誰都知道得明白。</p>
<p>可是德國的復興成績，遠出於盎格魯撒克遜人的豫料之上。那無名的英雄希特勒，崛起於草莽之間，率領了德意志國民，發揚踔厲地猛幹圖强；到了納粹黨的勢力席捲德意志全國，才把盎格魯撒克遜人覺醒過來。於是乎狐埋狐搰，原來是極力幫忙的，現在又明槍暗箭地多方加以中傷。可是棋高一着，他們使盡了種種的手法，總是給希特勒元首所反擊。他們迫不獲己，只得權把蘇聯拉做與黨，欲利用她來牽制德國。然而還是照例地受德國先下手的還敬，正當英法兩國的使節聯袂蒞臨莫斯科，堂堂地詮議着軍事上的協定等等之際，德蘇不侵犯條約却突如其來地披露出來，使他們啞然相對，討了一塲沒趣。</p>
<p>他們又驅日本，使陷於「窮鼠嚙貓」的死地。因此有滿洲事件的發生，不料更演進而爲中國事變。關於中國事變，盎格魯撒克遜人不能不說是　着相當的成功的。何以故呢？因爲是他們使蔣介石一派做着飼犬，向日本在吠，把其吠聲作爲世界的與論，想在世界的法庭懲罰日本。</p>
<p>但是日本終於給這惡策所惱，看出能互相同情者，互相理解者，是納粹德國和法西斯意大利。於是日德意三國防共協定成立，正要進而爲軍事協定的締結，卻値德蘇不侵犯條約的捍　。</p>
<p>他們想把失之於蘇聯的，再收之於日本，於是拼命地向日本說德國的壞話，說德國要賣掉本等無中生有的離間蜚語，要使東西兩大强國互相反目，俾盎格魯撒克遜人在束亞的地盤不致動搖。</p>
<p>然而蒼蒼者却並不獨佑盎格魯撒克遜人，局勢又吿逆轉，反而使日德問又趨親近，便在昭和十六年（一九四一年）九月，日德意三國同盟，底於成立。這樣，他們以毒攻毒，以敵制敵的策略，每事齟齬，使他們吁着「所謂天道，是耶！非耶！」的歏息。</p>
<p>（四）德蘇和日蘇的關係</p>
<p>但是，盎格魯撒克遜人本性原是執拗的。他們還是自騙自的以爲日德意同盟雖然成立，也不過是紙上的條約，日本的眞心，還是向着盎格魯撒克遜的，如果向日本加以壓力，日本一定會如他們所意料地屈服的。可是他們的如意算盤，又打左了，其結果，終於有昭和十六年（一九四一年）十二月八日對英美宣戰的大詔頒發。</p>
<p>盎格魯撒克遜人，二十餘年來輾轉依遠的三個敵人，在二十餘年後的今日，都遠比當時爲强大。盎格魯撒克遜人的預算，每事失着。但是到了現在，使他們才喘了一口氣的，是德蘇戰爭。</p>
<p>德國原是把盎格魯撒克遜人當做正面的敵人的。但是德國覺得若是和盎格魯撒克遜人決戰致勝，必定先要立於不敗之地，這其結果，便是德蘇的戰爭。爲了這個目的，德國才着手於那稱爲歐洲穀倉的烏克蘭；爲了這個目的，德國才着手於黑海的制海權；而那爲煤油產地的高加索，也爲這目的而伸手；雖然還沒有完全得手，但大有不久就要收得的希望</p>
<p>但是德國對於蘇聯的勢力，因爲估計過低，致其戰爭意外地延長而且苦戰。不過我們總是堅信德國早晚要達到目的的。倘是沒有德蘇戰爭，恐怕倫敦早已成爲廢墟了。英國的所以能够暫獲舒息，簡直可以說是蘇聯的恩賜。</p>
<p>盎格魯撒克遜人的陰謀還別有所在。那就是日蘇戰爭。他們未必是愛蘇聯而憎惡日本，也未必是愛日本而憎惡蘇聯。他們所嫌厭的是共產主義的蘇聯呢，還是八紘爲宇的皇國呢，恐怕不容易區別出來的。所嫌惡的是蛇，還是蚯蚓，姑且不論；可是如果嫌惡蚯蚓，蛇當然也厭惡的；這是一個確切的　喻。</p>
<p>這樣，他們常常煽動日蘇間的惡感，挑撥相互間的敵愾心。儘所可能，促使兩國間發生事端；訢天禱地，訢神禱鬼，念茲在茲，而爲着這事。</p>
<p>他們的魔手，怎樣地對日本動作？回想過去四五年的事情，就思過半了。無論是日本或是蘇聯，都是以不接受英美的定單爲賢明。</p>
<p>自國的利害，只有自國的人能够知道。現在再要從事日蘇戰爭，其爲兩損而無一得，是明白可睹的。松岡前外相於昭和十六年（一九四一年）四月在莫斯科和當時的外交部長莫洛托夫，締結日俄中立條約，實是一件很合時宜的事情。而其結果，英美的定單打着回票，兩方面現在還在堅持中。</p>
<p>（五）要戒備英美方面的離間中傷</p>
<p>總之，於日本，有日本的立塲；於蘇聯，有蘇聯的立塲。其立塲決不是同一的。但是兩國都是不應該隨和盎格魯撒克遜人的笛聲而載歌載舞，那是不消說得的。</p>
<p>最近加薩勃朗卡會談，羅斯福和邱吉爾要求斯丹林來會，却遭拒絕，這簡直是對全世界宣示他們的絕大失敗。</p>
<p>原來邱吉爾是在第一次世界大戰以後，做了英國閣僚，爲聲討蘇聯的張本的人。他是一個對蘇聯徹心徹骨憎惡的人。爲英國資本主義的代表者的邱吉雨，其憎惡共產主義的蘇聯，原是毫不足怪的。同時羅斯福也是這樣的。並且邱吉爾現在更明白地說：「苟其是納粹德意志的敵人，即使是惡魔，也要和他握手的。」他把斯丹林當做惡魔，恐怕現在和從前沒有兩樣吧！但是他們的立塲，是有和斯丹林握手的必要的。</p>
<p>可是邱吉爾要握手，斯丹林却不予應諾。邱吉爾和羅斯福，不遠重洋萬里，來到非洲的北岸，在那兒舉行茶會，應該爲其主客的斯丹林，却缺席不到，這不是使他們呆然自失吧！假定斯丹林是翩然蒞臨了，試問他們用什麽話來開談呢？無論怎樣，他們總是選着種種話柄，挑發日蘇戰爭，這是可以斷言的。</p>
<p>但是單對德國一國尙且應付不了，更要和日本爲敵，斯丹林斷不會這樣冒昧的。他是把甜酸苦辣一一分辨着的。對於日本表着好意與否，沒有質詢的必要；現在已經不是和日本打架的時期了，他應該是很知道的。像他們那樣無聊極思，空扯虛邀，眞是如同那所謂幽靈的求侶一樣。就這一點看來，盎格魯撒克遜人是怎樣陷於窮境，便不難想像得到。</p>
<p>但是盎格魯撒克遜人是決不會叫罷的。他們無論怎樣被推擠到角落裏，總是知道閃身之術的。他們向着日本，說德蘇戰爭的困難，德國已經陷於引退不得的困境，信賴德國是怎樣怎樣的危險。又向德國說日本經濟上陷於作繭自縛，末由自拔，只有屈服於英美，使德國懷疑日本的力量，同時使日本懷疑德國的力量。</p>
<p>又在另一方面，說德國不定在什麼時候，準備着外交上的翻觔斗，向日本說德國的不可信。又說日本已經把南方的資源悉數撈去，濡手攫栗，使德國徒然困殺於戰鬥，挑撥德國對於日本的猜疑心。像這樣舞弄着種種卑劣的手段，在日本和德國之間，極盡離間中傷的能事，妄想堅貞不渝的同盟發生龜裂。</p>
<p>他們這種手段，無論是日本，無論是德國，都老早已經看破了的。我們現在向着羅斯福，邱吉爾之徒忠吿：你們這種無聊多餘的離間中傷，還是中止了好吧。</p>
<p>盎格魯撒克遜人的魔手，先向意大利發動了。他們企圖把意大利從德國那兒拉去，使德國在歐洲方面陷於孤立。賢明的墨索里尼首相，先把意大利的戰時狀態强化，斷行內閣的改組，給他們一個雄辯的答覆。意大利只要墨索里尼存在的一天，是一天不會脫離三國同盟的。</p>
<p>我們的日德意三國同盟，是斷然要爲了當初樹立世界新秩序的目的，而完成這個戰爭的。在德意兩國，已經厲行禁酒令等，强化戰時狀態。所以日本便必須更加緊張，國民全體一律要以挺身於第一綫而活躍的精神，相與對應。我們現在不憚重複地說：日本戰爭的目的，是皇國的自衛，東亞的解放，世界新秩序的建設，三階段一貫合體的。要完成這目的，絕對不是一件稀鬆平常的事情；必須用着鬼神辟易，金石爲開的猛厲奮迅的精神，悉力以赴而斷行之的。（丁：譯自二月十六日至十八日東京每日新聞）</p>
<h3>高空層的奇怪現象</h3>
<p>— 鳥海一郎原著</p>
<p>穗高山頂上研的報告</p>
<p>航空醫學</p>
<p>近代兵器的主幹是飛機，然而無論有多少如何優秀的飛機，而沒有駕駛的人力，這也決不會製造出輝煌戰果。我國陸軍飛機隊一時不停地積械訓練，而引起全世界人士注意的，也是由於這一點。同時，隨此應運而生的便是航空醫學。</p>
<p>在聳立雲端的山峯上，因爲氣壓低，而使人體發生各種現象，如一般人所週知的暈山病和高山病等，這只是向來爬山越嶺者所關心的問題，而並未引起一般人的注意。</p>
<p>然而對於高度或超高度飛行的航空人員，當然必須特別重視這方面醫學上的研究。</p>
<p>因此，上月一號，政府公佈在名古屋帝國大學內設立航空醫學研究所，以敎授二人，助敎二人，助手四人爲中心，而專門探討這一學理與應用。</p>
<p>氣壓與知能考查</p>
<p>在設立這一新硏究所以前，帝大同學在航空醫學研究方面，早已取得幾許成就。去年夏天，在海拔三千一百九十公尺的日本阿爾卑斯穗高山頂上，以勝沼內科敎室底學徒爲中心，而設立山上研究室，努力實騐高空飛行技師的生理狀態</p>
<p>在高空，往往發生只在地上過活的人們所不能想像的事情，第一個，就是眼界縮小。</p>
<p>一般眼睛健全的人，當正面看的時候，其左右的事物，都相當多的收入到視覺裏；然而一昇入三千公尺的高空，即同一個人底眼界，却縮小了很多，有時候，竟像兩傍擋着眼睛的拉車的馬，左右完全看不見。這種變化是用眼界看來橫量的，但這是一種極重要的硏究，因爲駕駛員的眼界和飛機的設計都有相當關係。</p>
<p>另外，在穗高小房招集許多爬山者，先實行簡單的知能試騐，馬上證明氣壓低的地古，頭腦的機智就遲鈍。請看國民學校畢業考試的題目：「○○比走快，在可乘的東西中，○○最快」，普通的小學生，無論那個都可以馬上答出，頭兩個○○是「火車」，後兩個○○是「飛機」。然而在海拔三千公尺的地方，大學生的頭腦反不如國民學校底小學生，對於道類簡單問題，倒很奇怪地回答不出來。如數字叫從一千倒寫到九百五十，那就會錯誤百出，找不出一個完全對的答案。</p>
<p>工作能率薄弱</p>
<p>研究高空上工作能率，這也是航空醫學上一個課題。先讓手腕不動，叫宇指按一定的速度旋轉，用一種特殊機械，測量隨着動轉而生的疲勞，用曲綫記出製成表，然後拿來跟平地上的同一個人同一動作作比較。於是可以知道，在高空所作的運動，遠較平地所作者容易疲倦。此外，讓學生在山頂上直跑，回到研究室來，馬上檢騐血液。於是可以曉得，所謂乳酸和淡氣等疲勞素，比平地運動時多三倍。</p>
<p>這種實騐，當設計飛機時，應當特別注意到如何使駕駛簡易化，因爲在高空上知能减退，目機械運動比平地容易疲勞。</p>
<p>在這以外，高空上身體的變化，還有很多。味覺也變爲非常的遲鈍，普通一羹匙糖就是够甜的一杯水，但在三千公尺的高空上，就絲毫感覺不出甜來，却和普通水分辨不出來。苦酸等味也是如此，即如平地上最好的菜肴，一拿到高空來吃，那就淡而無味了。</p>
<p>我們旣然談到吃東西，那末就再講些與此有連帶關係的事情。在三千公尺的高空上，閃爲氣壓低，所以水在攝氏七十六度就沸騰。因此，在鍋蓋上如不壓上一塊大石頭，就不能煮熟飯。據說，這對於山上底研究隊會是一件頂苦痛的事</p>
<p>此外皮膚的感覺，在高空上也是遲鈍得出奇。如在手掌上，相隔一寸，刺人皮膚兩個針，但決覺不出來是兩個針。</p>
<p>空軍人員的養成與適性</p>
<p>也用遠心沈澱器來舉行試騐。這是研究當在徵妙飛行，急降轟炸，以及急劇下降，突然再使飛機恢復原來飛行的塲合，人體所起的變化。</p>
<p>當我們在百貨公司的電梯裏，上昇或下降時，總有心情不快的感覺，這是血液慣性想由頭部降下，或是倒流上昇所致。同此相仿，但比電梯強烈數倍的飛機，當然更有所不同。從高空上急降一千公尺後，界把飛機拉住，這眞使人頭暈。遠心沈澱器就是探討這一生理現象的。</p>
<p>另外一個重要的事情，就是向性試騐。例如在「因瑣碎小事而煩惱麽」？「當機立斷麽？」「迷戀空想麼？」等五十種問題紙上，求每一個爬山者回答，按其答案而判定其爲外向性或內向性。然後再調查究竟外向性者還是內向性者適合於高空。</p>
<p>非常有趣，這一調查的結果，證明優秀的爬山家全是內向性，都具有高度愼重的性格。在歐洲具有內向性，愼重和冷靜性格的日爾曼人，其航空技術的優越道理，就在此。</p>
<p>根據這一向性調查證明，在養成航空人材和判新其是否適性方面，是極寳貴的資料。</p>
<p>此外關於在高空裏血壓的變化，或者關於新陳代謝，都會舉行過各種試騐，這當然也提供很多高空與人體相互關係的暗示。</p>
<p>然而這種穗高山頂上的實騐，雖然是高空，但和飛機上總有其他好多條件的不同，所以這種實騐成果，是否能全部適用於航空醫學上，這倒不能不有所懷疑。嚴格說來，飛機上和高山頂上，是完全不同的。然而共中有許多原則上的一致，當然在某種程度上，可能據此類推。</p>
<p>總之，航空醫學仍然處於搖籃時代，雖然名古屋帝國大學以外的各大學也已經着手研究，但主要工作總是單純片面地讓專門硏究者去做，應當膂遍而深入起來。爲使日本航空事業的發展，則熱烈期待這方面的將來成就。（季：譯自二月二十一日大阪週刊朝日）</p>

<h3>達爾主張從小教育起</h3>
<p>— 孫嘉</p>
<p>達爾文幾番周遊世界，窺盡生物的蘊奧之後，埋頭數十年完成了震動舉世的「物種原始」生物的進化論。聲譽日增，來訪問他研究室的人也漸次多起來了。</p>
<p>一次有一個年靑美貌的夫人，兩手抱了一個可愛的孩子，和達爾文作以下的對話：</p>
<p>「啊，漂亮的孩子，幾歲了？」</p>
<p>「纔二歲半。」</p>
<p>「呵呵呵，很有趣。」</p>
<p>他說可愛，夫人高興地：「一定打算養成頂括括的人物。……對於這個，是要來與你商量的。」</p>
<p>「什麽？」</p>
<p>「這孩子的敎育，從什　　候開始好呢？」</p>
<p>於是達爾文微笑回答道：</p>
<p>「夫人，可惜的事，令愛已有一歲牛，來不及了。」</p>
<p>這位夫人碰了達爾文的釘子，　然達爾文認爲到二歲半（相當於國人四歲）尙未開始敎育，已經是「來不及了」的態度，未必是對，可是亦足見敎育時間的重要。旣未注意其先天的敎養，出生後又忽於襁褓及嬰兒時期的敎育，所以無怪達氏以生物學的眼光看起來已是「來不及的」了。</p>
<p>生物學上知道生物從胚胎發生到長成的一段時期中，其環境及敎養足以決定這生物將來的一切。襁褓及嬰兒時期的敎養，對將來的影響遠較我們想像的厲害得多。許多的習慣，思想，行爲都可以推源上去而尋出是種因於我們嬰兒時期的敎養的。所以「三歲定八歲，八歲定終生。」的俗語確有他科學上的根據。</p>
<p>通常我們對於兒童的言語舉動，都因爲他們年紀尙小而並不過分重視，認爲不能算數，而總是加以原諒的。但是這是一種十分危臉的錯誤，這好像星星之火，將來可以發生燎原的後果。應該愈早糾正愈好，否則難免要貽「來不及了」的後悔。</p>
<p>可敬的父親與母親們！你們子女的敎育不是從進學校才開始的，嬰兒時間的敎育遠較將來大學的敎育爲重要，爲你們子女未來的成就和幸福計，請即刻開始注意吧。</p>
<h3>一月份徵文錄取第七名　我的生活—助理家教</h3>
<p>— 滇</p>
<p>一個家居的女孩子，輾轉在狹隘的天地間，在別人心目中看來，也許家務是繁瑣的，生活是枯燥的。然而我卻安於斯，並且覺得生活中充溢了工作，健康安寗和愉快。因此我便寫下我的日常情况：</p>
<p>每天，每天，當陽光未上屋脊的時候，瓦楞，鋪着一層薄薄的霜，晨霧瀰漫着，四周的輪廓是糢糊的，氣氛是寂靜的。這時候我們的母鷄該要起身了，隨後，我給牠一頓豐盛的早餐——一碗水和一盤拌入麩皮的碎米，也給牠打掃屋宇，編製草褥。然而我們是恩惠互報的，到了午後，牠得意地喔喔喔的報道着。於是，我的喜悅來了，一個微溫的碩大的蛋，靜置在草褥上，第二天，鷄蛋冲荳腐漿，那是母親的早餐。把鷄安頓了，在淸新的空氣中深呼吸一會後，便寫昨天的日記，凡是經過的，感到的，我都記叙詳細。我處理一家的內政，也兼任了外勤，把居室收拾淸楚後便上菜塲去了，由於菜價的日漲，我這幾個每天規定了的菜錢，眞有配購乏術，這使我不得不採取緊縮政策，量與質都兩受其影響。</p>
<p>我們的飯食是米與雜糧並重的，並且花色繁多，黄的苞米粉，紅的赤豆和糙米，每種都加入三份之二的白米同煮，晚上，照例是麵條，赤豆粥，或菜粥，其中包括蕃薯，芋艿，胡蘿蔔，靑菜及碎米。午後，洗滌衣服，代家人縫製襪衣，或措拭地板。</p>
<p>黄昏燈下，那是一天中最恬靜的時候，我一面編結，一面閱讀，但這不是消閒的趨於低級趨味的小說之類，這些書中孕育着眞理，充滿了箴訓，在這艱苦卓絕的時代，尤其能體味到那些嘉言的眞切，當我不免爲失意之態所籠罩的時候，這會給我許多鞭策，也增加了內心的力量，導我向善，使我不爲物質而形悲喜。</p>
<p>我不塗脂抹粉，也不燙髮，我的衣服大都是陳舊的，雖然我亦與一羣小姐們交往，然而我不羨慕她們的新裝和皮大衣，如果她們只重衣衫的話，那末我也正不需要這種虛僞的友情。迢迢四百十七天了，我沒有踏進過影院和劇塲，因爲我旣不需要去受甚麽敎育，也不想去欣賞「郎啊」！「妹啊」！的悲喜劇。平時，家庭操作使我得到多最的運動，所以我的身體的各部發育，是均衡健全的。</p>
<p>暇時，我也娛悅自己，晴空的行雲，月夜的清輝，晨光，夕陽，自然的玄秘，變幻無常，這給我一種微妙的美感，偶然，我也淸歌一曲以抒情。我最愛獨處，當我度過一個深思的時間後，精神上便會得到更良善的啟示。　謝淑，女性，二十歲，曾在武進蠶桑學校肄業。</p>
<h3>川西異俗志</h3>
<p>— 懷之</p>
<p>羗民是怎樣求雨的？</p>
<p>川西理番縣境，所居諸邊民中，各有其不同的求雨方式。嘉戍族完全依靠喇麻唸經，所以方法尙比較劃一。至於羗民則雜亂無章，雖爲一個種族，而其求雨方式往往是因地而異，這裏介紹的是關於龍溪寨求雨的傳說及其方式。</p>
<p>龍溪寨是羌民區的一個寨子，處於理番縣之東，沿雜谷河的左岸，保長叫陳光明，這一寨的求雨傳說就出在陳保長的家裏。</p>
<p>據說三十年前，陳家一女郞漫遊於山野間，常有一隻蜜蜂隨其身旁，女郞回家吿之於父母，父母謂何妨就隨蜜蜂去一探究竟，女郞照樣去做，果然被蜜蜂架走，到達一海，遂嫁與龍王。這位女郞就是今日陳保長的姑母，陳家失女郎後，到處尋找，在海邊發現女郞外出時所帶的麻綫，方知下落。據說那幾年內，凡天早不雨，村人就聚集海邊哭喊，殺羊祭海，就可以下雨，這樣形成了他們求雨的固定方式。</p>
<p>過了三年，陳家辦喜事，女郞突然歸來。携一木匣，囑其母萬勿開視，母好奇，趁女兒不在，開匣檢視，發現兩條小龍臥其內，二小龍以爲要喂奶，探頭而出，母大驚，將二龍揑死，女郞知禍已難免，分別時囑其母請家人到海邊觀看，海面若出水泡，就是她回到龍王面前開始受氣，水色現紅色，則表示她正在受刑，水呈平靜，則表示她已死了。女郞走後，其家人到海邊去看，果然逐步應騐。過了幾年海枯乾了，遺留在龍溪寨三十里外的後山上只是一個旱海。</p>
<p>求雨的方式也因之改變了，凡遇旱年一定要帶陳家的後代到旱海邊上，村人一齊怒打直到嚎啕痛哭爲止。這表示村人對陳家之不滿，至龍王面前把他加以懲罰，雨遂降臨。如此一直相傳數十年之久，近幾年每次求雨都是帶着陳光明去挨打，今年本來是大旱，應當由陳保長去受刑，據聞陳保長隨衆出發後竟隻身逃回，所以寨裏的人對他非常不滿意，認爲本年未能早雨，是由於陳保長不肯爲公犧牲的緣故。他們從未考慮過大地上的自然條件，傳說和巫術畏期的統治着他們的心靈和行爲（酬移濟貧金</p>

<h3>寫在「友朋節」之前</h3>
<p>— 歇浦生</p>
<p>黄警頑先生，首倡的「三三友朋節，」轉瞬快到了！友朋，是五倫之」，君臣·父子·兄弟·夫婦·朋友。人生於世，誰也離不了這五倫的範疇的。俗諺有：「在家靠父母。出外靠朋友。」朋友有信，朋友有義，朋友能助成你的事業；朋友能救濟你的苦難；朋友和你切磋學問；朋友能忠吿你的過錯；所謂：「四海之內。皆兄弟也。」這是從好的朋友方面說。至於：有錢是朋友，沒錢是陌路，建築在金錢上的朋友，祗不過是酒肉朋友而已！無所謂道義，無所謂忠信，尤其處茲世界大亂的叔季之世，和人心大變的時候，友朋們詐偽相尙，波譎雲詭，有賣友求榮的，有括友自肥的；有落井下石的；有種種不道德的引誘，使你墮落深淵，而不能自拔。友道淪喪，於今爲烈！故中國孔聖學會沈思敏·馮雲初君等有鑑於人慾橫流，損人利已的朋友，滔滔皆是，積極倡導敦厚倫常，整肅友道，提倡友道的標語，是「擇交要善，朋友要信，執事要忠，待人要恕。「古諺敬人者人恒敬之，愛人者人恒愛之。」友無信不立，故宜忠·信·篤·敬。此外有無相通，（朋友有通財之誼）疾病相扶持，風雨同舟，痛癢相關，是友這最要緊的原素。管鮑分金，和羊角哀，左伯桃的捨命全交，是足以風世的。松·竹·梅歲寒三友，千古不朽，是最好的例子，願與讀者共勉之。</p>
<h3>苦悶生活</h3>
<p>— 慕</p>
<p>米珠薪桂，物價鋧漲，凡我升斗小民，原可量入爲出，收支平衡者，現則莫不捉襟見肘；債台高築，典質度日，已成普遍之現象。</p>
<p>按戰前四口之家，茍月入六十，除以半數供食用，再斗抵房租外，出其所餘，應付零用，已可綽綽有餘；但目下所入，多在千元左右，購糧糶米尚感不敷，遑論其他！</p>
<p>薪水階級，境況窘迫，一言難盡，設更遭意外週折，疾病，纏繞，生死相繼，實在無法應付，焦頭爛額，山窮水盡，慘劇之情，　非筆墨可以形容；處世境地，所謂薪水，祇似杯水車薪而已！</p>
<p>聞某種組織，其屬員恒爲環境所迫，懦弱者愁眉苦臉，頹廢呻吟，旣無異味辦事，復無精神苦幹；狡黠者倡爲怠工，要挾加薪，又或唆衆消耗水電，浪用文具，作爲消極之抵制，無形之破壞；他知利用地位，營私舞弊，假公濟私，奸詐百出；經濟漏洞，至深且鉅，行政效率，亦加速削弱。</p>
<p>然在當局，每推諉龐大之開支，無法擔負，或藉詞少數職員生活之靡爛，遂置多數同人之艱苦於不顧，充身勿聞，假作癡聾，致使若干幹練人員，心旌動搖，見異思遷，楚材晋用，豈非人材之一大損失乎？</p>
<p>故爲整個大局着想，在上者宜同悄下屬境况之淸寒，酌量改善其待遇，務使專心供職，毋或思遷；在下者亦當體念當局賺錢之不易，安守本分，克盡厥職，並力事撙節，勉渡難關；如是則兩全其美，社會事業之進步，實利賴之。</p>
<h3>寫「日記」前言</h3>
<p>— 企雲</p>
<p>我本不想寫「日記」，以爲這是一件與人麻煩不過的事；况我的脾氣又懶得很。</p>
<p>個近日來，似乎覺得往往爲一件小事上惹出很大的感觸來；以致一日的抑鬱或一日的欣快；然而這一種由感觸而產生的——抑鬰——欣快。其實便是一個人生活的「經騐。」很有價値而有意義的把牠記下來的必要；所以從今天起我便下了寫「日記」的決心。</p>
<p>我得寫出一句警句在這裏，勉勵自己：寫日記要「恒心」才是。</p>
<h3>萬世師表</h3>
<p>— James　Hilton著　依今譯</p>
<p>（十八）</p>
<p>老勃夫爾斯微笑着，說：「一些沒有什么，老家伙——一些沒有什么——我們正在猜想，你將在什麽時候從那美好的睡眼中醒來。」</p>
<p>「但是—呃哼—我聽見你們—你們在談着我—」</p>
<p>「絕對無關緊要的話，我的親愛的朋友！眞的，我老實對你說。……」</p>
<p>「我想我聽見你們—你們裏面一佩—在說，這是一件可憐事—呃哼—可憐我沒有—一個孩子……是不是？……不過我有的，你知過……我有……」</p>
<p>他們都笑着，不回答他，頓了一頓，吉普斯又開始了微弱而悸動的咯咯聲。</p>
<p>「是的—呃哼—我有的，」他用說，帶著震顫的歡笑聲。「他們有幾千……他們有幾千……並且都是男孩子。」</p>
<p>然後，合唱曲在他的耳朶裏唱起最後的和音來，比了他以前所聽見的，唱得格外宏大，格外美妙，也格外使人恬　。……拍底茀·波動特·波爾森·柏次·布爾曼·布爾維斯·畢　——　　　·　　　　·　　　·　　·　伯爾·里迪第一……現在又到了我的身旁，你們都要聽一句最後的說話和一個笑話。……哈伯爾·哈斯勒特·哈特菲爾德·哈澤利……我最後的笑話……你們聽見這個麽？這使你們美麽？……波恩·波士頓·波維·勃拉福德·勃拉德利·勃拉霍霍爾——安徒森……不論你們在那裏，不論發生了什麼事，這時你們和我在一起吧……這個最後的時機……我的孩子們……</p>
<p>不久吉普斯就睡熟了。</p>
<p>他似乎那樣地平安，以致他們都不致向他說晚安而驚動他；可是在早上，正當學校裏發出早餐鐘聲來的時候，勃洛克菲爾德得到了消息。「勃洛克菲爾德永不會忘記他的可愛之處，」卡特萊特在對全校演說時說。這話是不對的，因爲一切事情到末了總是要被忘記的。不過，林福德，不論怎樣，總會記得，並且講述着他的故事：「在吉普斯去世的前夜，我對他　　　　　……（　　）　　社會服務</p>
<h3>失孩復得　一個家長獲得的教訓</h3>
<p>（來函）我的孩子從學校裏走失後，東尋西問，毫無影踪，滿以爲不易找回的了，總算幸運，他迷路以後，就落到公共租界警務人員的手裏，把他收留起來，整整地三天，才得領回團聚，白累了親友一番，眞是不安之至。</p>
<p>我對於這件事情有幾點感觸：</p>
<p>第一，我對於公共租界工部局兒童保障科和捕房風化股的辦事熱忱，應表示十分感謝，我的孩子要是不幸而落於歹人的手裏，那麽即便能找回，但他所要受到的苦痛，必將難於想像。</p>
<p>第二，家長對於不識路徑的幼孩，應隨時隨地防他走失，最好在衣襟裏面註明姓名地址，以便不幸走失時給收留者辨認，不過這個辦法僅適用於善良之人。所以幼孩出行，不但應由年長者隨伴，並且應有嚴密的防護措置，這次我在工部局和捕房裏面所見走失幼孩之多，眞使人驚駭不止，希望市民以後要特別謹愼。</p>
<p>最後我希望門禁不嚴的各個小學，對於幼孩應有防備私出的措置；一般市民遇到迷路或被拐的幼孩，應立即報吿警務人員，這樣由各方面通力合作，那麽不幸的事情總可逐漸消滅了。</p>
<h3>簡易祛痰法</h3>

<p>隨地吐痰，確是最不衛生，又失雅觀；而且影響公共健康，莫過於此，此種惡習慣，非特當局承以嚴厲禁　，還　大家自動澈底剷除才好。</p>
<p>檢討痰涕來源，不外二因：即內因與外因是也，外因者，偶然傷風感冒，而喉嚨覺癢，氣管發炎，分泌驟增，咳痰　　，因此作　。內因　，　胃本體虛弱，且喜嗜食肥肉，木魚，蟹螺等物，膩寒不易消化，於是脾失健運，痰濕安不內生哉！</p>
<p>若欲免除此種惡習，宜去請敎醫生診治，以絕其根，若無力醫治者，倘遇外感咳痰，不妨購服佛慈杏仁精，如向來多痰涕者（即內因之痰）服二陳丸極佳，以上兩藥，因藥性和善而不偏，祛痰之力亦宏，且極經濟，如肺病多痰者，最宜服魚肝油丸，務使肺健而痰自消，實係根本除痰之法也。</p>

<h3>War Aims and the Future of Victory: After Reading Mr. Tokutomi Iichiro's Writings</h3>
<p>Tokutomi Iichiro, a prominent Japanese political commentator, published an article titled "A War to Crush the United States and Britain from Both Material and Spiritual Perspectives" in the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun from February 16th to 18th (translated in today's Japanese edition of this newspaper). It offers an accurate assessment and critique of the so-called war aims and strategic centers of the enemy—the United States and Britain—in the current world war. It provides a frank exposition of Japan's war aims, and a sincere explanation of the current state of international relations and the future prospects of Japan's war effort. We believe that Mr. Tokutomi's work is of great significance not only to Japan but also to us, the Chinese people, as Japan's ally, and is worthy of careful reading. This is because it can dispel the dark clouds that have enveloped people's hearts since the Rochechouart port meeting and the reports from the European and African theaters during the meeting, and it once again explains to the world the true content of this war and its future prospects.</p>
<p>Mr. Tokutomi first points out the three stages of the Greater East Asia War: the first stage is for the self-defense of the Japanese Empire; the second stage is for the liberation of the nations of East Asia; and the third stage is for the construction of a new world order. He also specifically points out: "These three stages are not mutually exclusive. From a planar perspective, they are a trinity; from a three-dimensional perspective, they are a continuous three-stage process." Therefore, Mr. Tokutomi sternly says: "To regard this war as being about obtaining rubber, tin, kerosene, hemp, sugar, rice, timber, etc., is a complete profanation of this war." Because this "is the result of the war, and by no means the purpose." This clear explanation will resonate with the hearts of all small and weak nations in East Asia, and it is also a powerful response to those who generally misinterpret the purpose of the Greater East Asia War. However, from the standpoint of us Chinese people, we cannot think that as long as we completely trust Japan, we will have a share in the future liberation of the East Asian nations and a share in the construction of the new world order, and that we do not need to fight ourselves because Japan will take care of everything for us. No, this is a very big mistake. The completion of Japan's second and third stages of war aims is absolutely impossible if there is only passive trust without the active struggle of us Chinese people. Here, we need to call on the Chinese and Japanese people to pay attention to strengthening cooperation.</p>
<p>The true purpose of the war being waged by the United States and Britain is clearest to us Chinese people who have suffered from aggression for a long time. The three enemies of the Anglo-Saxons mentioned by Mr. Tokutomi also accurately reflect the concerns of British and American imperialism. However, we feel that in addition to Germany, the Soviet Union, and Japan, the United States and Britain have a fourth enemy, which is the liberation movement of the colonial peoples who have long suffered from their aggression and exploitation. Since the Second World War, Britain first lost a major ally, France, and a series of small countries in Europe that opposed Germany, and Britain has never dared to launch a frontal war against Germany. The slogan of a "Second European Front" has been shouted for two years, which is a very long period in a war; but the United States and Britain still do not have the courage to open a war against Germany in Europe. As for the enemy of the Soviet Union? It can be said that they have held on to it. As Mr. Tokutomi said, "If there had been no German-Soviet war, London would probably have become a ruin long ago. Britain's ability to obtain temporary relief can simply be said to be a gift from the Soviet Union." However, what the United States and Britain are preparing is "to repay kindness with malice." This is not a curse, but a fact. Because the fear of the Soviet Union by the British and American imperialists is fundamental, and they are preparing for a suitable opportunity to wage war against this enemy at any time. As for Japan, the United States and Britain suffered a complete defeat. In the face of the three major enemies, the United States and Britain have had to make a de facto surrender. However, the British and American imperialists have grown fat by sucking the blood of the colonial peoples. When the United States and Britain bow their heads to the three major enemies in front of them, the awakening and struggle of the colonial peoples will be the fear in the hearts of the United States and Britain. We hope that all the small and weak nations of East Asia will put more effort into the united and independent movement of assistance, so that the independence of India following the liberation of the southern nations will see the day of the total collapse of British and American imperialism.</p>
<p>As the day of the total collapse of the old order draws closer, the struggles of the British and American imperialists become more intense. They have not only first lured Italy, but are also working to alienate the friendly relations between Japan and Germany; and further provoking conflict between Japan and the Soviet Union. Naturally, the Axis powers will not be fooled by this kind of alienation, slander, and provocation. Even Japan and the Soviet Union are keenly aware and will never take chestnuts out of the fire for the British and American imperialists. However, among the weak nations, such as the internal alienation and provocation of India, and the provocation and alienation between other East Asian nations, we need to be more vigilant. The second stage of the Greater East Asia War, whose purpose is to fight for the liberation of the East Asian nations, is in the process of vigorous advancement. And the purpose of the third stage, which is the construction of a new world order, will also begin to be prepared and promoted. The implementation of the Sino-Japanese agreement on the abolition of extraterritorial rights is the first proof of the purpose of the war. And the cooperation between China and Japan also gains a clearer revelation from here. The East Asian nations must use closer mutual assistance and unity to shatter the sinister schemes of British and American alienation and provocation, and fundamentally eliminate the British and American imperialists. The confidence in the final victory should be firm, but victory cannot be awaited as a gift from others. The fruit of unearned gain can only increase one's shame. We believe that all East Asian nations are unwilling to endure shame and participate in the battles of the new era.</p>
<h3>The Third Plenary Session of the National Education Conference Successfully Opened Yesterday; Participating Representatives Are Willing to Practice the Resolutions and Jointly Shoulder the Heavy Responsibility of Wartime Education</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency) Yesterday (the 28th) was the last day of the Third National Education Administration Conference. The third plenary session of all members was held at 9:00 a.m. Minister Li, the chairman, asked Deputy Chairman Superintendent Su to preside. After the formal ceremonies, Secretary-General Vice Minister Yang reported on: (1) Attending members: Pei Fuheng, Qiao Wanxuan, Shen Tongliang, and 96 others; observers: Su Xuexuan and 7 others. (2) Reading the minutes of the second plenary session. (3) Reporting on the receipt of documents from various parties, including eight education administration reports from the North China Education General Office and other agencies. Then the discussion began. (1) The Second Group, the Higher Education Group and the Education Administration and Funding Group, were no longer discussed. (3) The Fourth Group, the Social Education Group, discussed the issues of public education halls and youth schools, with Xu Jidun, Yang Zhengyu, Qian Weizong, Yu Yifan, Zhao Zhengping, and others expressing their opinions one after another. It was resolved that public education halls should continue to be operated, and youth schools should be established as much as possible. Other cases were passed according to the review opinions. (4) The Fifth Group, other groups' proposals, including those on textbook issues, with Fan Zhongyun, Qu Mengkai, Shao Mingjiu, Dai Yingfu, Chuan Fan, and others expressing their opinions one after another. They all deeply admired the efforts of the Ministry of Education in the four tasks of compilation, review, printing, and distribution of textbooks under the current environmental system, but they still requested that the Ministry of Education strive to break through the factual difficulties in the printing and distribution matters, and should also forward the request to the Ministry of Education to request the Executive Yuan to establish a state-owned printing company, and hoped that after the textbooks were compiled and reviewed, the Ministry would allow various bookstores to freely print and reprint them to meet the needs. The remaining cases were all passed according to the review opinions. (5) Discussed the conference declaration and slightly revised the text, which was unanimously approved. Finally, there were two temporary motions: (1) First, the National Middle School will conduct a four-two system trial. After repeated discussions by the members, instead of having a majority of national schools conduct a trial with unknown results, it is better to have the experimental middle school affiliated with National Central University conduct a trial first. The conclusion was that this matter is of great importance and should be carefully studied and handled. It was resolved that since the conference already has an academic system curriculum committee organization, and the motion was passed first, the opinions of the members should be organized and submitted to the Ministry of Education for reference and deliberation. (2) The core idea of the case was that the mover of the motion should send it in writing to the Secretariat of the Conference for referral to the Ministry of Education for reference and handling. The entire discussion was not completed until 11:40 a.m. The adjournment was announced. During the closing ceremony, the members took a short rest, and then the closing ceremony was held. Minister Li, the chairman, personally presided over the ceremony, the music was played, the entire audience stood in respect, the chairman took his seat, the national anthem was sung, and the highest salute was paid to the national flag and the portrait of the Founding Father. The chairman respectfully read the will of the Founding Father, and the chairman gave a closing speech. Then, the chairman read the conference declaration (recorded separately). Thus, the Third National Education Administration Conference with fruitful results and abundant results was declared closed in the resounding sound of military music.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency) The Third National Education Administration Conference, after three days of careful discussion, successfully closed at 11:00 a.m. on the 28th. Since China's participation in the war, everything has entered a wartime state, and everything should also be suitable for the wartime system. Therefore, although there were more than 200 proposals at this Education Administration Conference, to sum up, the focus was on how to establish a wartime education system and improve the living conditions and treatment of educational personnel. Regarding the establishment of a wartime education system, there is no doubt that the new national education should be implemented. Chairman Wang also repeatedly instructed in his speech at the opening meeting, hoping that the national education administrative personnel will work together to promote the New National Movement. Therefore, the representatives participating in the conference all paid close attention to the issue of reforming the academic system to implement the new national education, and this issue also achieved satisfactory results. Other issues concerning education funding were thoroughly discussed in detail, and satisfactory solutions were obtained. The spirit of the representatives participating in the conference remained unchanged from the opening to the closing, and the enthusiastic situation was unprecedented. At the same time, after the closing, all members repeatedly stated that after returning to their posts, they would strive to implement the resolutions of this conference and jointly shoulder the heavy responsibility of current wartime education. Therefore, the gains of this conference are extremely significant, and it is expected that my country's education in the future will be more suitable for the wartime system and complete the responsibility of wartime education.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency) The Third National Education Administration Conference successfully closed on the morning of the 28th. In addition to personally attending the meeting on the 26th to give instructions, the chairman also hosted a banquet for representatives from various places at the International Club at 7:00 p.m. today in his capacity as President of the Executive Yuan. The representatives from various places, led by Minister Li, attended on time. The mood was quite enthusiastic for a while, and it did not disperse until about 9:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Conference Issues Declaration</p>
<p>Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency) The Third National Education Administration Conference successfully closed on the 28th and issued the following declaration: Education is the foundation of national construction and the foundation of the country. The relationship between the rise and fall of the country and education is extremely important. At this time when the world situation is changing rapidly, if we want to survive, we must work hard to protect our lives from falling. This kind of maintenance can only be achieved through education. Moreover, the reason why our Chinese nation has been able to exist independently for 5,000 years should be attributed to the power of education and culture. Therefore, the development of education should be urgently planned. How can we ignore it? Our country has been invaded by foreign enemies for years. Before the incident, we had not yet achieved universal education. After the incident, education was even more devastated. The Government returned to the capital in June, and this association held its first meeting to collect the broken remnants and engage in restoration. The following year, in June, the second meeting was held to seek further development. In the past three years, we have followed the clear instructions of "gathering strength and teaching lessons" and made the greatest efforts for the country and the nation. Fortunately, the scale is complete and progress is expected. This is comforting to our compatriots. Educational facilities must be in line with the needs of the times in order to produce the expected results. Considering the current situation in our country, normal education should continue to be developed.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the world situation has changed dramatically. Our country has resolutely declared its participation in the war in order to realize the liberation of East Asia. All undertakings have entered the wartime system. Therefore, how wartime education should be implemented is especially in urgent need of discussion today. This conference is held in this great era, and its significance is more important than the previous two sessions. We look forward to the future with infinite joy, and the heavy responsibility in the future cannot but be deeply alert to ourselves.</p>
<p>Although this conference lasted only three days, it had detailed discussions and resolutions on various departments of education administration, education funding, higher education, general education, social education, as well as how to train young people, how to reform the academic system, and how to adapt to the wartime system. However, my colleagues still have something to tell the national education colleagues and compatriots, which are described as follows: Education is the foundation of national life, and youth are the part of national construction. If we want to establish the foundation of the country and maintain the life of the nation, we must rely on the strength of youth. Therefore, what kind of young people does the country need to educate? We should cultivate such young people to supply them. Today's trend has fully manifested that if we want to survive as a nation, we must rely on the hard work, endurance, bravery, and precision of the people of the whole country. All the frivolous and extravagant habits of young people in the past should be cleared away. In particular, we must understand that in this extraordinary period, only by overcoming things with spirit can we avoid falling into pessimism and decadence. The so-called vitality and vigor are born from this. This association should make every effort to seek possible solutions to the pain of education colleagues. At the same time, my education colleagues should always be steadfast and recognize the importance of their own responsibilities. Do not be self-deprecating, and do not easily give rise to great ambitions. This is what this association sincerely expects from education colleagues across the country.</p>
<p>Education is one of the social undertakings. On the one hand, it is the driving force for improving society, and on the other hand, it relies on social supervision and support to achieve its own improvement. However, although the people of the country understand its importance, they do not regard it as an urgent matter. This is what my colleagues feel most distressed about and cannot help but say. Since our country announced its participation in the war, the government has repeatedly instructed on policy guidelines, emphasizing increasing production and ensuring security. Both of these must take education as the basic for their implementation. Because if we want to increase production, we must first cultivate production talents; if we want to ensure security, we must first have correct thinking. This conference has repeatedly discussed production education and youth training and made many decisions. It can be seen that the people of the whole country have felt that these matters cannot be delayed. What we are calling for in front of the people of the country is to ask the society to re-estimate the power of education and give it strong supervision and support. Then, education and society can be integrated into one piece, and the further development of education is imminent.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of education, in addition to issues such as systems and methods, depends on leading by example. If the teacher is not good, how can he ask others to be good? In the past, the morale of the Han and Song scholars was admired by all. This is because only by having a healthy body and deeds that can serve as a model can we achieve this. In recent years, the disadvantages of the academic atmosphere should not only be blamed on the youth themselves, but also on the leaders. At this time when the whole country is vigorously promoting the New National Movement, my education colleagues should practice what they preach and set an example. The establishment of prestige, like the wind on the grass, will make young people not only avoid falling into depravity when they enter society, but also lead the entire people. This is another expectation of this association for education colleagues.</p>
<p>Strengthening education is the lifeblood of the country. All my compatriots know this. However, after the devastation of the war, the number of people out of school is feared to be beyond expectations. If we do not take immediate remedial measures, what could be more dangerous? However, economic problems are consistent in all aspects, and everyone feels strapped for cash. However, not eating for fear of choking is what the ancients ridiculed. In this environment, we can only try to do our best within the possible range, and creating one more literate person for the country will add one more share of vitality. At the same time, all authorities, whether central or local, must also go all out and absolutely avoid a perfunctory attitude. This is not only the case for compulsory education, but for other issues as well. However, compulsory education is the most important. Therefore, this association has made the most practical resolutions on local education funding, hoping that the local authorities will deeply understand this and do their best to maintain this matter. This is not only what this association hopes for, but also what the people of the whole country hope for. The most important thing in governing is to be practical and realistic. The colleagues of this association should strictly abide by this instruction and strive to implement all the resolutions that have been made to avoid repeating the mistakes of empty talk. Moreover, this time, we have gathered education colleagues from all over the country to exchange opinions, discuss facts, and conduct research. All of these show a phenomenon of unity and consensus. We sincerely hope that colleagues will, under the guidance of the leaders, follow the established policies of the central government, adapt to the needs of the times, and work hard in their respective positions to give full play to the greatest power of education. This association is fortunate, and the country is fortunate.</p>
<p>Attending Representatives Elaborate on Their Thoughts</p>
<p>Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency) Since the opening of the Third National Education Administration Conference on the 26th, the representatives from various provinces and cities have always concentrated their spirits and enthusiastically discussed the establishment of a wartime education system, the reform of the academic system, and the improvement of education administration, and have conducted thorough reviews and achieved great results. The conference closed as scheduled on the afternoon of the 28th. Our reporter interviewed the representatives from various places who bear the heavy responsibility of local education administration. The representatives from various places were happy to share their thoughts as follows: (President of National Peking University, Qian Daosun) Although this is the third National Education Administration Conference, it is the first time that representatives from North China have participated. It is of great significance and there are many gains. As for his thoughts on this conference, he can use the word "fruitful" to represent it. (President of National Shanghai University, Zhao Zhengping) Convening this entire education administration conference after participating in the war is not only promising for the future reform of education administration, but also a major gain in the wartime system. (President of National Jiaotong University, Zhang Tingjin) It is a pleasure for educators from the North and South to gather in the hall and express their opinions as much as possible. It is especially gratifying that concrete solutions have been obtained for various issues related to the academic system. (Dean of National Beijing Normal University, Li Taifen) Although Chinese schools are more backward than Western schools, we cannot regard Chinese culture as lower than Western culture. There are many points that can be expected from the gains of this National Education Administration Conference in wartime, and it is also a major contribution to culture. (Director of Education of Zhejiang Province, Xu Jidun) Gathering educators from the North and South in one hall is an unprecedented initiative since the return to the capital, and the harmony of opinions is a satisfactory gain of the conference. After returning to Zhejiang, we will gradually implement the resolutions of the social council, and we will provide the Ministry of Education with a release on how it is implemented. (Director of Education of Hubei Province, Huang Dazhong) The effect of education is not easy to see, and the responsibility of education is extremely heavy, but China's education funding is extremely scarce. The representatives of this council have had close discussions on this matter, so the future of education can be actively developed as a result. (Director of Education of Shanxi Province, Zhao Jiwu) After this National Education Administration Conference, education administration, regardless of other systems, funding facilities, has been satisfactorily resolved. The gains of the conference can be said to be considerable. (Director of Education of Shandong Province, Yu Kangde) The unification and printing issues of textbooks have been discussed in this conference and have been satisfactorily resolved, which is very gratifying. Although the conference was only three days, it was always harmonious, and the future can be predicted. (Director of Education of Henan Province, Sun Jingqing) I did not participate in the previous two National Education Administration Conferences. This time, I was able to gather relevant people from various places in one hall to jointly discuss future education policies. The effect of the gains of this conference is also within expectations. (Director of Education of Hebei Province, Sun Jinshan) Satisfactory gains have been made on the academic system issue at this conference. We are local education administrative officials, and we follow the orders of the central education authorities in everything. My opinion on the academic system issue is that everything depends on people. The relationship between the goodness and evil of the academic system is ultimately not as important as the relationship between the goodness and evil of people. (Director of the Tianjin Education Bureau, He Qingyuan) What I feel very happy about the gains of this conference is that everyone can exchange opinions without barriers. It is expected that the future of Chinese education will be more developed as a result.

<h3>The Entire Western Hubei Region is Under the Control of the Japanese Army; Japanese Army's War Results in Henan</h3>
<p>Hankou, 28th (Central News Agency) After the defeat of the Yu army under Wang Jingzai's command in Hubei Province, the entire western Hubei region north of the Yangtze River in the Sixth War Zone of Yu has fallen under the control of the Japanese army. This trend has two important implications: First, the peaceful areas are becoming increasingly larger; second, the strategy of suppressing Chongqing from all directions of Yichang, Shashi, and Yuezhou is becoming increasingly stronger. This is because the area is a large triangular area formed by the main stream of the Yangtze River and its largest tributary, the Han River. The area is an important transportation hub in northern Hubei, with fertile farmland and smooth water transportation. Shashi, Xindi, Haoxue, Renkou, Jianli along the Yangtze River and Shayang Town and Xiantao Town along the Han River are all centers of water transportation and distribution centers of materials. The area is located on the main transportation routes of Hubei and Hunan provinces, and is the gateway to the three towns of Wuhan, and its location is extremely important. Moreover, the area is located on the front line of the Japanese army, in the middle of Yichang, Yuezhou and Hankou, and is the connection point between the above three places. After being occupied by the Japanese army this time, it poses a great threat to the Sixth and Ninth War Zones of Yu army. Moreover, after the Japanese army controlled the area, the Yu army in that area has completely withdrawn. In the future, the water transportation line between Hankou and Yichang will also be opened. The remote mountainous areas west of Yichang are more suitable for stationing large-scale troops. Therefore, the operation to destroy Chongqing in one fell swoop can be expected.</p>
<p>Kaifeng, 28th (Central News Agency) The elite of the Japanese army launched a fierce attack on the 17th Regiment of the 7th Teaching Brigade of the Communist Army, about 1,000 people, near Zhuanmiao Village, 80 miles east of Kaifeng on the 37th. As a result, the Communist army left 146 bodies behind and 67 people were captured, including two lieutenant officers. The Japanese army also intercepted one mortar, grenade launcher, and many other military supplies. Southern China Line, 28th (Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Japanese Air Force Continues Heavy Bombardment, Shattering Chongqing Army's Counter-Offensive Attempt</h3>
<p>South China, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - After the Japanese Air Force peacefully entered the Guangzhou Bay airfield at 1:00 PM on the 21st, they continued to cooperate with certain units to heavily bomb military facilities of the Chongqing army in Yangjiang (50 kilometers east of Guangdong). On the 22nd, they further heavily bombed the westward advancing troops of the Chongqing army in the Yangjiang and Dianbai areas, and also heavily bombed Chongqing military facilities in Meilinlian (50 kilometers east of Guangzhou Bay). Another squadron fiercely attacked Liuzhou Airport, where the runway and various facilities were bombed and burned. On the 23rd, they again attacked Yangjiang and enemy barracks in the forests of that area, hitting and setting fire to military warehouses. Eight Chongqing army trucks, fully loaded with soldiers heading south, were also hit and destroyed. On the 24th, they bombed Yangjiang, Dianbai, and Maoming separately. On the 25th, they shattered Chongqing military facilities in Liangdong (40 kilometers north of Guangzhou Bay) and Dianbai. They also severely attacked the 155th Division of the Chongqing army and other units moving west and south. The Japanese aircraft's continuous five-day heavy bombing has completely crushed the Chongqing army's attempt to counter-attack south. There was no sign of US Air Force planes stationed in Chongqing, and the Chongqing army's anti-aircraft fire was also extremely weak.</p>
<p>A certain Japanese military base, 38th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Japanese Army's fighter squadrons have recently been closely cooperating with ground units in combat, and on the 27th repeatedly attacked Liuzhou, Daoxian, Lingling, Guilin, and other places. Chongqing planes seemed to have already fled and were not seen taking off to engage. However, Chongqing planes were discovered massing to escape at Liuzhou Airport. After being pursued by Japanese planes, they caught fire and crashed. Furthermore, Chongqing's anti-aircraft fire was relatively intense. In all the above engagements, Japanese planes suffered no damage, it is said.</p>

<h3>Fierce Seesaw Battle Unfolds in the Donets River Region, Germany Deploys Fresh Troops in a Steady Stream of Reinforcements, Vanguard Reaches Southwest of Izyum</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 28th (Domei News Agency Dispatch) - A great and fierce battle took place yesterday in the densely populated Donets Basin on the Eastern Front, with each side winning and losing. Fresh German troops are constantly entering the area to reinforce the German forces that began to move north towards Kharkov again a few days ago. Initially, German forces were only applying pressure on Soviet forces between Kharkov and Taganrog Bay. Yesterday, however, it appeared to have spread to the Orel and Kursk regions north of Kharkov. According to yesterday's Berlin communiqué, the Soviet attacks south and north of Orel were unsuccessful, and German shock troops repelled the Soviet troops twelve miles. The fighting was fiercest in the Kramatorsk and Krasnoarmeysk regions. Moscow news acknowledged the increased German pressure, saying that villages and towns in this area are changing hands more and more frequently. Both sides are now dispatching large air forces to cover their troops, and air battles are frequent. A certain important town southwest of Kramatorsk, the transportation center in the western Donets Basin, saw fierce street fighting yesterday. The German commander dispatched fresh troops from Slavyansk (a railway center in the Donets Basin) to the area in a steady stream. Berlin news claimed that the tank corps under Soviet General Popov, who first attacked the Donets Basin at the beginning of this month, had been scattered, and the wedge-shaped formation that broke through towards the Dnieper River had been completely destroyed. The Soviet 4th and 10th Tank Corps had been completely routed, and the 3rd and 18th Tank Corps had also been severely damaged, losing their striking power. The attacking German forces advanced towards Izyum, and their vanguard had reached the southwest of the town. In the northern Caucasus, the Red Army again broke through the Kuban River bridgehead fortress held by the German army, but was driven back. South of Lake Ilmen, the Soviet army maintained an active offensive on a broad front, but has been contained.</p>
<p>A certain place on the Soviet border, 28th (Havas Agency Dispatch) - In the Donets River region on the Soviet front, a fierce seesaw battle has been taking place in recent days. For the past two weeks, Soviet troops in that area have attempted to rush to the western railway junction, in order to cut off the German forces between Voroshilovgrad and Rostov. The German authorities, fully aware of the danger, immediately withdrew troops from the Caucasus and other places to reinforce. Up until a few days ago, the Soviet troops' offensive seemed to have been contained, and the German withdrawal was completed smoothly. In the last 48 hours, German forces suddenly counterattacked the Red Army between Kramatorsk and Krasnoarmeysk, and the situation changed accordingly. In addition, Moscow radio announced yesterday that German forces are concentrating in Stalino in a steady stream, and fierce street fighting is taking place in a certain important city southwest of Kramatorsk. The name of the city was not announced. In the Caucasus, Soviet troops have already arrived in Novorossiysk. Red Army forces near Rostov have not been able to advance towards Taganrog. The Red Army authorities are consolidating their forces. Between Kharkov and Orel, the situation is chaotic, and the fighting seems to have been hampered by heavy fog. In the Lake Ilmen region to the north, Soviet troops are developing an offensive. In the past 48 hours, fierce fighting has taken place in the Lovat River area. According to Moscow Radio, the Red Army has broken through the German defense line in the Volkhov River area between Lake Ilmen and Lake Ladoga.</p>
<p>German Army Gradually Gains Advantage on Both Northern and Southern Flanks, Flexible Strategy Proves Effective</p>
<p>Berlin, 28th (Haitong News Agency Dispatch) - Yesterday, Berlin military figures commented on the situation on the Eastern Front, saying that Soviet troops have made no progress and the German defense strategy has been quite effective. Although Soviet troops are still attacking fiercely, they have not succeeded. German forces have gradually gained an advantage on the southern wing of the front, and on the northern wing, the Soviet offensive has also stalled since the German counteroffensive was successful. Soviet troops have repeatedly attacked in the northern Kuban region, but have been repulsed. There are only local battles in the Mius area. The remnants of the Soviet 7th Cavalry Corps, after being cut off from their retreat route behind German lines, are now being eliminated. The German offensive southwest of Izyum has made considerable progress. Soviet troops, using tanks as cover, attempted to break through into the northeast, but have not succeeded. Soviet troops lost 54 artillery pieces and 400 carts in fighting in Kharkov and Kursk. Fierce fighting is now taking place north and south of Orel. After reinforcements arrived, Soviet troops launched a fierce attack, but German forces resisted strongly, so Soviet troops made no progress at all. The Soviet offensive south of Lake Ilmen has now proven ineffective, it is said.</p>
<p>Berlin, 28th (Haitong News Agency Dispatch) - The Soviet advance northwest of Kharkov and west of Kursk has now been contained. The flexible strategy adopted by German forces in Konotop has prevented the vanguard of Soviet troops from advancing lightly. There is no change in the fighting in the Orel area.</p>

From north to south, the German probing points were as follows: (1) the area north of the road from Mateur to Djebel Abiod; (2) the area from Téboursouk to Sidi Nsir; (3) the area slightly south of Medjez el Bab. The German forces apparently used the 10th Panzer Division to prepare to break through the weak points in the British front lines. Although the scale of the fighting was small, the atmosphere in the area was very tense. The general direction of the German probing was towards Bédja and Bou Arada, with the aim of cutting off the roads connecting British forces to the rear. After severely attacking US forces in southern Tunisia, the Axis forces are now withdrawing to the Faid Pass mountain range from which they launched their offensive twelve days ago.

<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Japanese Minister of Greater East Asia, Aoki, issued a statement today to offer congratulations on the occasion of the Manchukuo Founding Anniversary on March 1st. He stated that the significance of Manchukuo's founding is extremely important, as it is the initial step in building a new order in East Asia and a pioneer in establishing the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. It marks the first counterattack by East Asian nations against the Anglo-American ambition to dominate East Asia. Since the founding of Manchukuo, it has maintained inseparable, friendly relations with Japan. The people have cooperated to promote good neighborliness. Time flies, and Manchukuo has reached its tenth anniversary. Today, its national strength is abundant, and it has become an important stronghold in East Asia. This is truly gratifying. Since the start of the Sino-Japanese War, Manchukuo has consistently contributed all its personnel and strength to support Japan's war efforts and has guarded the north like Mount Tai. All its assistance is something Japan should deeply appreciate. He also recalled that during the grand celebration of the tenth anniversary of Manchukuo last year, the Second Construction Plan was established to expand national strength. Today, the construction of the Co-Prosperity Sphere further enhances the meaning of Manchukuo's founding. Therefore, we expect Manchukuo to utilize its experiences from the past ten years and further develop its national strength.</p>
<p>Speech by Manchukuo Premier Zhang</p>
<p>Xinjing, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Manchukuo Premier Zhang issued a statement today on the upcoming Founding Day. He stated that as we welcome the eleventh anniversary of the founding of Manchukuo amid the Greater East Asia War, we cannot help but recall the fervent spirit and excitement of the founding. Looking back, the Anglo-Americans, in the name of the League of Nations, resorted to all kinds of barbarity in an attempt to hinder our nation-building. However, today, eleven years later, the world situation has changed drastically. Anglo-American forces have been driven out of East Asia, and the time for the rise and unity of East Asian nations has finally arrived. Therefore, our nation-building eleven years ago was, in fact, a declaration of war against the Anglo-Americans and a prelude to the rise of East Asia. Our mission has become increasingly important with the progress of the Greater East Asia War. The 43 million people must unite and move forward with the same spirit and enthusiasm as at the time of the founding towards the second phase of construction.</p>

<h3>Germany in Total War Posture: National Mobilization Advances Towards Victory</h3>
<p>— Correspondent Moriyama of the Asahi Shimbun</p>
<p>(Berlin, 20th) Germany's "home front" is echoing the war at the front lines. Workers and ordinary citizens are gritting their teeth and working hard. After Germany occupied Ukraine, it initially planned to revive peacetime industry and prepare for a long-term war, hoping to give the home front a chance to breathe. Therefore, control was relaxed for a time. However, contrary to these expectations, strict orders are issued daily in "official notices." Citizens are busy going to coupon offices one day and labor bureaus the next. The calls "National crisis!", "Engage in war with all national strength!", "Total mobilization of labor!", "The era of total war has arrived!" are shouted loudly on wireless radio and in newspapers, like the sound of cannons on the front lines thousands of miles away, causing tension in the lives of Berliners.</p>
<p>Organized Nationalization</p>
<p>The streets of the rear, which once reverberated with songs and dances, have become silent due to the tragedy of Stalingrad. The patriotic fervor that had erupted among the citizens has also been controlled by the government's successive announcements of "Orders for Male and Female Labor Applications" and "Orders for Store Closures." In the face of the crisis, all peaceful personal activities are considered secondary. Under government control, the total mobilization of all national labor in the rear has begun. As long as they are Germans, they obey this order and fully demonstrate their patriotic zeal. Tens of millions of people are silently moving in the direction indicated by the government. Three and a half years after the war began, there has been a tremendous change. From a third-party's perspective, it is a tragic and heroic picture. The war in Europe is changing. In Hitler's words: "Rather perish than hold onto the past." The final decisive battle stage is about to appear. If Germany cannot overcome this difficult crisis, the dream of a new world order, the plan for a new Europe, and the German nation itself will fall into an abyss from which it will never recover. This situation is clearly presented to everyone, so the laborers' expressions carry a tragic air, and they struggle with a determination to die. Officials such as Goebbels, Himmler, Funk, and Schickel are promoting this great transformation in Germany with the unwavering enthusiasm of the Nazi Party's ascetic era.</p>
<p>Conscription of Female Labor</p>
<p>The two extraordinary decrees mentioned above have fundamentally changed the general rear life, social life, and even the family life of Germany. These changes are even more pronounced in cities than in rural areas. Few people work less than forty-eight hours a week. In addition, all men aged sixteen to sixty-five and women aged seventeen to forty-five must register with the labor bureau this month. Therefore, from March 1st, those who are completely unemployed, women under the age of forty who have not given birth, and men and women who work less than forty-eight hours a week will be assigned to work in munitions factories and other labor services.</p>
<p>Any place lacking labor can obtain millions of auxiliary laborers from this source. Until now, almost all men have been drafted to perform various wartime duties, so this decree can only conscript the female labor force that still remains in civilian society. All women who do not have a child under the age of six, or two children under the age of fourteen, regardless of whether they are widows or divorced, or whether they are the relatives of fallen soldiers or the wives of soldiers on the front lines, must perform labor service. Of course, pregnant women are exempt from this labor service. In simple terms, German women are ordered by national law to "choose between children and the factory."</p>
<p>No Work, No Food</p>
<p>There are many idle wives in Europe, but they have been eliminated by the war. Even middle-class widows in the idle class will disappear in Germany. To prevent evasion of service, food coupon offices will not provide food coupons for the following month to anyone who does not have proof from the labor bureau that "this person has applied." Therefore, no matter how one tries to hide, one must register with the labor bureau.</p>
<p>The principle of "no work, no food" is the most thorough German method to eliminate those who do not work and eat, and the wasteful people who do not produce. This is the total war posture of Germany in the fourth year of the war.</p>
<p>Men on the Front Lines, Women Making Bullets</p>
<p>The work assigned to the women conscripted this time is no different from that of men. The conductors of buses, streetcars, and subways have gradually become women's jobs since the beginning of the war. Ticket sellers are also women, and it is strange to find an occasional male conductor. Therefore, women have recently participated in mining, which was previously a job only for men. In many munitions factories, metal factories, and chemical factories, the number of female workers is gradually surpassing the number of male workers. Due to advances in production technology, many departments can now be staffed by women. According to recent national average statistics published in the newspapers, the ratio of men to women in chemical factories is 100 to 55 (compared to 35 before the war), in rubber factories the ratio is 100 to 82 (compared to 60 before the war), and in paper mills the ratio is 100 to 141. As a result of this total labor mobilization, it is expected that the male laborers conscripted to the front lines will be entirely replaced by women. Men will fight on the front lines, and women will make bullets in the rear. There will be a significant change in the scope of duties for men and women.</p>
<p>The Ingenious Method of Enjoying "Vacation"</p>
<p>Women in wartime Germany are no longer wives guarding the family for men on the front lines. Now, they can be regarded as soldiers on the home front, directly participating in the war.</p>
<p>This raises the issue of "vacation." Soldiers on the front lines are given the opportunity to return home for a certain period. If the wife is not at home due to night shifts, wouldn't the "vacation" be in vain? Therefore, a method was devised to prevent "vacationing" soldiers from becoming pessimistic. The regimental commander issues a certificate to the man stating, "Permission is granted for a one-week vacation." This certificate gives the wife serving in the company or factory the right to be released from her labor obligations. This kind of extraordinary measure in an extraordinary time in Germany, compared to the Japanese Minister of Health's answer in parliament that "a female compulsory labor system is not yet necessary," shows that Japan's national strength is still abundant.</p>
<p>80,000 Stores Closing Down</p>
<p>The "Order for Store Closures" issued by Finance Minister Funk orders designated businesses to cease operations by March 15th. After full implementation, there will be a significant change in the lives of ordinary citizens in the rear. This measure echoes the "Labor Application Order." First, the purpose is to reallocate labor by closing down unnecessary businesses in wartime. The typewriters and telephones in the closed stores can also be transferred for military use. Vacant houses can be used as dormitories for military labor. Department stores can be transformed into hospitals. Because there are fewer merchants, business travel and freight transport will naturally decrease, and railroad cars can be transferred for military use. According to German newspaper reports, 80,000 stores have closed down voluntarily due to the war. There are still 600,000 stores nationwide. It is unknown how many stores will be forced to close due to this decree, but the scope of closures is gradually expanding. As a result, only stores related to food and daily necessities will remain.</p>
<p>For example, it was initially planned to close 70% to 80% of tobacco shops and sell "standardized cigarettes" of a certain quality. After the operations of small and medium-sized merchants and industrialists are suspended, the postal, transportation, and electricity services required for these operations can also be greatly reduced. This measure will greatly reduce the number of healthy middle-class people nationwide. In extreme terms, in German society, apart from the "10,000 people in the uppermost property-owning class" mentioned by Goebbels, there will only be two types of people: laborers and officials who control laborers. This fact in Germany is noteworthy in the life-or-death struggle with the socialist communist system of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>A German newspaper editorial stated: "The era of considering the visual and psychological impact of store operations has long passed." Reading this reveals the situation in wartime Germany. The merchandise displayed in German store windows from peacetime are merely window decorations arranged for visual and psychological impact, with no intention of selling them. Therefore, they are advised to close down. This tendency to abandon pretense and express things honestly is the most fundamental change in Germany's wartime guidance policy. This has been guided by the shift in Germany's domestic propaganda policy. Since late January, Germany's domestic propaganda policy has been to inform the people of the truth about the situation.</p>
<p>Learning is Also Focused on War</p>
<p>The policy of maintaining entertainment, recreation, and other daily rear life in as normal a state as possible to avoid tiring the people with the war has become a thing of the past. The harsh wartime situation has also changed the attitude of "academic freedom" in German universities. According to a recent announcement by the Party's Student Guidance Headquarters, university students should no longer engage in empty philosophical speculation. Learning should be limited to subjects urgently needed in wartime. Special decrees have been promulgated regarding the tasks of university students in wartime.</p>
<p>Scholars' debates and research attitudes for the sake of learning are warned against. University research is focused on direct subjects necessary for carrying out the war. Reading unnecessary lectures wastes the time of promising students about to depart for the battlefield, reducing Germany's fighting power. Therefore, the university system exists mainly with medical and engineering departments as its center and implements wartime reforms. Abandoning all pretense and honestly dedicating all of the nation's strength to "war" is the starting point for all future German policies.

Muslims will also hold victory prayer ceremonies on the 3rd.</p>
<h3>Philippine Executive Commissioner's Message to the People: Urges Active Cooperation with Japan to Complete the Great Task of Rebuilding the Philippines</h3>
<p>Manila, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Philippine Executive Commissioner Vargas, referring to Prime Minister Tojo's statement in the Diet on February 28th that Japan is determined to promptly realize Philippine independence, issued a message to all Philippine people on the 26th, urging them to actively cooperate with Japan to complete the great task of rebuilding the Philippines. The gist is as follows: "Fellow Filipinos, we will achieve independence. The purpose of Japan's war is to liberate East Asia from Anglo-American domination. It has already achieved brilliant results and is about to complete its purpose. Now, based on its noble spirit, it guarantees us glorious independence, proving that Japan is sincerely striving to liberate the Philippine nation. Therefore, there is no need for us to continue to take hostile actions against Japan. According to the precedents of past victorious nations, the Philippine people should have been regarded as conquered people, the Philippine soldiers as prisoners of war, held until the end of the war before being released, or the Philippines should have been left desolate. However, Japan has not only not taken such measures, but has also allowed the Philippine people to participate in political activities under the guidance of the military administration from the beginning, released Philippine prisoners of war, rebuilt all facilities destroyed by the war, and promoted the idea of national awakening, showing the true meaning of national preservation in theory and practice. Therefore, the honor of liberating and gaining independence from Anglo-American political domination and economic exploitation can only be realized through active and comprehensive cooperation with Japan. Therefore, we sincerely hope that all Philippine people will cooperate with Japan in their respective positions to complete the great task of rebuilding the Philippines and establishing complete security."</p>

<h3>Shops Selling Goods Above Price Limits Found With Concrete Evidence; Serious Cases Will Be Closed Down; Illegal Trading of Securities Will Be Punished</h3>
<p>It is learned that the French Concession Administration, over the past few days, has ordered twenty detectives from the Political Department to join a large number of personnel from the Food and Price Management Department at 2 Fuli Road to conduct strict investigations throughout the concession from morning to night. They are investigating whether shops are complying with all the prices stipulated by the authorities and whether the daily sales revenue and the registered goods and money exceed the price limits. According to relevant sources, the investigators have already found dozens of shops with concrete evidence of exceeding the price limits and are compiling reports. The authorities will review these reports in detail soon and impose penalties ranging from fines for minor offenses to closure for serious offenses.</p>
<p>Hoping Merchants Will Restrain Themselves</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council, in order to maintain stability, is strictly cracking down on speculative trading in various exchanges and markets that resemble stock exchanges. Any Chinese person who engages in the buying and selling of goods, securities, warehouse receipts, or bills of lading without the approval of the competent authority will be fined 10,000 yuan or sentenced to imprisonment in accordance with the law if found guilty. Non-Chinese persons who engage in illegal transactions of the above-mentioned items will also be punished accordingly. However, the authorities sincerely hope that merchants in various industries will restrain themselves.</p>
<h3>French Consul General Simultaneously Strictly Prohibits Publishing Prices; Violators Will Be Confiscated</h3>
<p>French Consul General Magre has recently taken the same steps as the Shanghai Municipal Council and issued a notice stating that from March 1st (today), all weekly publications, books, pamphlets, magazines, and gazettes are strictly prohibited from publishing financial news without the special permission of the French authorities. This does not apply to items with officially limited prices. The market prices of food and any other items, and their trends, are strictly prohibited. Publications and their associated individuals who provide news, create statistical tables, or are for other purposes will also have their publications confiscated and their printing presses closed if they violate the above regulations.</p>
<h3>Bank of China Establishes Trust Department; Begins Operations Today; All Branches Will Resume Operations Within Six Months</h3>
<p>Since its reorganization and resumption of business on September 1st last year, the Bank of China has followed the regulations of the Ministry of Finance to handle all deposit and loan businesses related to the development of industry and commerce. At the same time, with the cooperation of the Central Reserve Bank, its business has progressed rapidly, handling domestic remittances, regulating the industrial and commercial economy, and achieving great results. The branches and offices in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui regions will generally resume operations within June of this year. It is learned that the bank has now submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance for approval to establish a Trust Department to handle all trust deposit and loan businesses. The capital is 1.15 million yuan, and it will operate independently from today (1st).</p>
<h3>Fifth Phase of Grain Distribution in the City: Nanshi Opens Grain Sale of Two Sheng Total, Comprising Whole Rice and Broken Rice</h3>
<p>The fifth phase of grain distribution based on population count in the city has been completed by the Municipal Grain Bureau in accordance with the actual population figures of each district. It is stipulated that each person can purchase 1.2 he of whole rice and 0.8 he of broken rice per ten-day period, totaling 2 sheng, for a combined price of five yuan. Nanshi District has already begun the general sale of grain yesterday. Other districts are having their public grain sales offices first pay half of the rice funds and complete the procedures for releasing the rice. Once completed, grain sales will also begin in each district within one or two days. For the grain distribution in early next month, all public grain sales offices will follow the new regulations issued by the Grain Bureau, which require payment of rice funds before the release of rice, so that the city's grain policy can be put on the right track. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has already issued a notice requiring all pawnshops within its jurisdiction to obtain a license to operate. Some pawnshops, due to weak capital and failure to meet the qualifications for pawnshops, have been sealed up by the Municipal Police Department on the 22nd of this month according to Law Order No. 51, and ordered to cease operations. The Social Affairs Bureau, in view of the increasing difficulties of the common people's livelihood, has reorganized the pawnshops.</p>
<p>Regulations to be Followed During the Current Period</p>
<p>An investigation revealed that pawnshops in Nanshi and Zhabei districts, etc., were attempting to profit illegally by charging higher interest rates on pawned goods than those in the two concessions, charging 7% per month. Moreover, the time limit for redemption was also shortened to only two months, which is obviously oppressing the common people and is highly inappropriate. Therefore, the pawnshops have been ordered to reform the time limit for redemption to four months and must not violate this rule. If there is any instance of superficial compliance but actual violation, the matter will be investigated and dealt with by sealing up the pawnshop. Furthermore, the Bureau is thoroughly eliminating thieves hiding within the boundaries, and therefore requires pawnshops:</p>
<p>Pawning and Redemption Based on Residence Permits</p>
<p>Whether pawning or redeeming items such as clothing and jewelry, residents must present their residence permits to the pawnshop. When accepting pawned items, pawnshops must copy the resident's Citizen Identification Card into their account books for verification purposes. This will prevent criminals from rashly pawning stolen goods. If the items cannot be converted into cash, the trend of theft can be curbed. It has been found that the above measures have long been implemented in the two concessions, and now they are also being implemented in the city, so that the peace and security of the area can be ensured. All pawnshops must strictly comply with these measures, otherwise, if any violations are found, they will be sealed up for the crime of receiving stolen goods, and the managers will be severely punished.</p>
<h3>Imposition of Feast Tax in the City Government's Jurisdiction: Uniform Collection with Personnel Sent to Monitor at Railway Entrances</h3>
<p>The feast tax in the city has been designated by the Municipal Government as a special fund for education in the city. The four districts of Nanshi, Zhabei, Pudong, and Xucao have already started collecting the tax. In order to increase educational funds and balance the burden on citizens, the Municipal Government issued a notice yesterday that all other districts will also uniformly collect the tax. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Uniform Collection in New City Areas</p>
<p>The Municipal Government has found that since the feast tax was first levied in the four old city districts of Nanshi, Pudong, Xucao, and Zhabei, the tax revenue situation has been excellent. In order to increase educational funds and balance the burden on citizens, the Municipal Government has decided to uniformly collect the tax in all areas under its jurisdiction, including Jiading, Baoshan, Beiqiao, Nanhui, Fengxian, Chuansha, Chongming, and other districts in the western part of Shanghai and the new city area, so as to ensure fairness. The Municipal Government issued a formal notice yesterday, ordering all restaurants, food shops, and catering businesses within the jurisdiction of each district to comply with the regulations and collect and pay the tax on behalf of the government, without excuse for exemption or concealment, which would lead to punishment.</p>
<p>Clear Regulations on Feast Tax</p>
<p>However, merchants often deliberately misinterpret the regulations regarding the feast tax, leading to repeated resistance and disputes in the collection of taxes in Nanshi District and other areas. Therefore, the Municipal Government has specifically clarified that all restaurants, food shops, and catering businesses in each district that handle banquet tables and individually sold dishes, or simultaneously sell noodles, rice, and pastries, should calculate and collect the tax on behalf of the government. The sale of individual snacks and open-air food stalls is exempt from the tax in order to show consideration and differentiation.</p>
<p>Reorganization of Tax Collection Office Personnel</p>
<p>Ma Wenhua, director of the feast tax collection office in the four districts, has begun to adjust the internal personnel allocation in order to strengthen the collection organization, re-screening and appointing personnel. At the same time, in order to prevent evasion of taxes in Nanshi District, special personnel have been dispatched to be stationed near the open iron gate areas to monitor the entry and exit of banquets in order to assess and collect taxes, thus providing adequate educational funding.</p>
<h3>Chengdu District Students Mobilized to Assist in Maintaining Traffic Control Work for Six Shifts Daily; Six Students Assigned Per School; Yesterday Was the First Day with Satisfactory Results</h3>
<p>The Chengdu Road Police Department of the Public Concession, in order to further improve traffic order within the concession, sent special letters to all primary and secondary schools within its jurisdiction, stipulating that each school should select six students wearing armbands, led by teachers, to assist patrol officers in maintaining traffic order in designated areas, guiding citizens to walk on the left, and providing appropriate assistance to the elderly and young when crossing the road. The work is divided into several shifts each day, with each shift lasting two hours. Yesterday was the first day of implementation. The students were full of energy and received guidance from teachers, patrol officers, and baojia personnel, resulting in very good results.</p>
<h3>Money Shops of All Members Clearly Marked as "Remittance Shops" in Order to Differentiate Themselves from Other Shops; However, Clear Indication is Not Mandatory</h3>
<p>Member remittance money shops affiliated with the Shanghai Money Trade Association have historically never clearly marked their remittance status. Subsequently, as Shanghai's financial industry developed, exchange money shops (members of the Money Exchange Industry Association) were first established, followed by the establishment of discount money shops (non-member Yuan Heng Li Zhen money shops of the Money Trade Association), and then the proliferation of opium exchange money shops (members of the Opium Exchange Industry Association). All are named money shops, but they are affiliated with different associations and have absolutely different business scopes. Now, according to a proposal from its members, the Money Trade Association requires member money shops to immediately mark their remittance status to maintain their established reputation. The matter was formally approved at the annual meeting. It is said that the reason for using the "Remittance Shop" name is due to the three special circumstances mentioned above. After this case is approved, the shops will be marked separately in the future. All bills, account books, passbooks, seals, etc., will also be annotated with the name of the remittance shop. However, whether or not to add this clarification is at the discretion of the various shops in the same industry, and the Association authorities will not issue a mandatory notice.</p>
<h3>The Only Thing That Isn't Expensive: Salary</h3>
<p>The soaring prices of all goods have become a topic of conversation for people, but there is also something that is not expensive, and that is salary.</p>
<p>The Nanjing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions investigated the wages of Chinese laborers in December of last year. It is said that including meals, the highest paid were stone porters, averaging nine yuan per day. The lowest paid were restaurant waiters, earning only 1.2 yuan per day, with most earning around four yuan. You can imagine how difficult this kind of life is. The above figures are calculated in Central Reserve Bank Notes. Year-end bonuses and other rewards are not included, only the fixed daily income.</p>
<p>According to statistics, the highest wage was for stone porters, followed by painters, with a maximum of 7.3 yuan. All others were below six yuan. Tailors earned 6.9 yuan, suitcase makers earned 6.75 yuan, barbers earned 6.7 yuan, carpenters earned 6.25 yuan, car drivers earned 5.2 yuan, and leather workers earned 5.15 yuan. These were already considered middle to upper level salaries.</p>
<p>In addition, there were even lower wages. Silversmiths earned 3.75 yuan, rickshaw pullers earned 3.25 yuan, hotel tea servers earned 3 yuan, tea pickers earned 3 yuan, horse cart drivers earned 3 yuan, teachers earned 2.5 yuan, rice mill workers earned 2.4 yuan, antique workers earned 2.5 yuan, Chinese clothing tailors earned 2.25 yuan, paper offering makers earned 2 yuan, bean curd shop workers earned 2 yuan, printing industry workers earned 2.7 yuan, cooks earned 2.1 yuan, bathhouse attendants earned 2.4 yuan, and restaurant attendants earned 2.3 yuan. Most were like this, and even lower were the workers in the hot water industry who earned 1.35 yuan, leather goods manufacturing who earned 1.7 yuan, and restaurant waiters who earned 1.2 yuan. According to Chinese customs, side income may exceed salary, so the above cannot be said to be the total amount of living expenses, but the official salary is only this amount, and a difficult life can be imagined.

<h3>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau Held Its First Group Wedding Yesterday; Mayor Chen Presided Over the Wedding Ceremony</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Government's Social Affairs Bureau, in order to promote frugal weddings and save on extravagance, organized its first group wedding yesterday (28th) at 2:00 PM in the grand auditorium of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce at the Tianhou Palace Bridge. Mayor Chen personally attended the wedding of this session's brides and grooms, totaling fourteen couples. The last couple had a groom who was a Japanese national of a friendly country. It is an innovative idea for a Sino-Japanese marriage to participate in a group wedding ceremony. The oldest bride and groom in the first group were 45 years old, and the youngest was 16 years old. All the grooms wore blue robes and black jackets, and the brides wore pink dresses. Mayor Chen and the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau officiated the wedding.</p>
<h3>Central Reserve Bank's Business Settlement for the 31st Year; Net Profit Reached Over 17 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>Since the Central Reserve Bank was established at the end of December in the 31st year of the Republic, it has completed its second settlement. The net profit for this year (i.e., the 31st year) increased due to the increase in interest income from various loans and public bonds, reaching over 17,722,600 yuan. Compared to the net profit of over 4,184,000 yuan in the 30th year, it increased by over 13,042,000 yuan. However, this year's net profit includes the surplus from last year. In accordance with the provisions of the Central Reserve Bank Law, the aforementioned net profit will be distributed as follows:</p>
<p>Public Reserve: 8,700,000.00 yuan</p>
<p>Special Reserve: 2,200,000.00 yuan</p>
<p>Paid to the National Treasury: 3,000,000.00 yuan</p>
<p>Other (Employee Bonuses and Retained Earnings, etc.): 3,326,547.41 yuan</p>
<p>Total: 17,226,547.41 yuan</p>
<h3>Application for Relief from Enemy Property Disposition; Deadline Set for March 9th; As of the End of February, Over Ten Thousand Cases Have Been Accepted; It Is Expected That All Cases Have Been Handled, and It Has Been Decided Not to Extend the Deadline</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of handling enemy property, the Japanese military authorities, in order to safeguard the property rights of Chinese non-enemy nationals, issued a proclamation on November 10th of last year stating that those who are true rights holders and not enemy nationals may apply to the authorities for relief from enemy property disposition and receive normal protection. The original deadline for application was February 9th. However, those with special unavoidable reasons and deemed legitimate by the authorities were still allowed to submit applications. It has been learned that as of yesterday, the total number of applications accepted for relief from enemy property disposition exceeded tens of thousands of cases. It is expected that all cases have been handled, so the enemy property management authorities have decided to set March 9th as the deadline for accepting applications. If anyone still fails to apply by the deadline, even if they are true rights holders and not enemy nationals, their property will be treated as enemy property. The authorities also hope that all property owners will complete the procedures as soon as possible to avoid losing their rights. The application procedures have been explained in detail in previous announcements, and property owners are urged to pay attention. After canceling the registration of enemy consulates or enemy nationals, it is also necessary to obtain a permanent lease from the Japanese Consulate or a land license from the Municipal Government in order to effect relief from enemy property disposition. Those who wish to obtain a permanent lease from the Japanese Consulate can contact the Yokohama Specie Bank Building at 24 Bund. The land license should be obtained from the Municipal Government's Land Administration Bureau.</p>
<h3>Expectations of Friendly Nation Figures: After Japan Implements Its New Policy Toward China</h3>
<h3>I Love China</h3>
<p>— Fumio Takeuchi</p>
<p>"If one only observes Shanghai's arid environment and stifling air, then one will be led to doubt the true essence of China. In reality, China has the Yangtze River, winding for five thousand miles, the Great Wall stretching for ten thousand li, and the Yellow River, originating from the Bayan Har Mountains in Qinghai and flowing to the Bohai Sea. These natural wonders are sufficient to prove the long history of China over thousands of years, making one unable to help but admire the greatness of this nature."</p>
<p>The above passage was spoken by Mr. Fumio Takeuchi, who devoted his life to studying Chinese issues. In his youth, he traveled extensively throughout China, conducting on-site inspections. After returning to his country once, he came to China again. He is currently the Managing Director of the Shanghai Japanese Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>He also said, "In the eleventh year of Taisho (1922), when I was in my thirties, I visited Chongqing. First, I went from Hankou to Yichang, passing through Wanxian, where I stayed overnight. The next evening, I arrived in Chongqing and saw Zhuge Kongming's legacy, the White Emperor City. That kind of beautiful scene still makes me nostalgic today. I took a small boat upstream, passing through the Three Gorges of Yichang Gorge, Wushan Gorge, and Fengshuang Gorge. On both sides of the river, there were steep cliffs and beautiful red leaves, and large flocks of lambs, which were endless to admire. The natural beauty here can never be described by a pen or a painting. Therefore, the literati of past dynasties have used ever-changing words to describe the danger of these gorges. The kind of unparalleled scenery in the world makes one unable to help but throw down one's pen in amazement."</p>
<p>Mr. Takeuchi is a man of superior insight. At the same time, he advocates not turning his back on reality. He believes that it is useless to play with cleverness in handling life's affairs. Everything should follow nature and conform to the laws of the universe.</p>
<p>Mr. Takeuchi believes that the basis of Japan's new policy this time must also start from this point. Because Japan's shift in its China policy and its unhesitating practice have caused the Chongqing regime to feel pain and hesitation, and the end is not far away. Mr. Takeuchi here recalled the situation when he first met Chiang Kai-shek.</p>
<p>"I met Chiang Kai-shek when he came to Shanghai after the end of the Northern Expedition. During our conversation, I saw his frank answers, as if he was quite confident, but the impression he gave me was that he did not seem like a commander-in-chief, but rather a chief of staff. Now he has become a traitor to East Asia. How could he have ended up in this situation? The biggest reason is that the United Kingdom and the United States were pulling the strings behind the scenes. At the same time, the Song family, deeply tempted by the United States, constantly incited him from the side, and thus formed an inextricable bond with the United States. However, Chiang Kai-shek had studied in Japan, and he clearly understood Japan's strength and also respected the spirit of Japan. He knew that fighting Japan would lead to defeat, but he was always thinking about the strategy of retreating step by step, using the vast territory and resources."</p>
<p>In his final conclusion, Mr. Takeuchi strongly emphasized the great mission of the Shanghai economic community. He said:</p>
<p>"Those who love Japan can only guide the construction of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere if they love China. The main purpose of modern warfare is to build while fighting, and the National Government is strengthening its forces and focusing on economic recovery. From these points of view, Shanghai is not only the economic center of China, but also the center of the Co-Prosperity Sphere geographically. Therefore, the mission of the Shanghai economic community is very important." (Yunpeng: Translated from the February 25th issue of the Mainland News)</p>
<h3>Deeply Wish That the Chinese People Will Develop a National Consciousness</h3>
<p>— Kinjiro Hayashide</p>
<p>Mr. Kinjiro Hayashide has resided in China for forty-two years. In the past, he served as the Emperor's interpreter, and later transferred to serve as the Consul in Nanjing, and the First Secretary of the Embassy in Beijing. He has traveled to countries all over the world. He currently serves as the Dean of Dongya Tongwen College. He hopes that the Chinese people will each have a national consciousness. He said:</p>
<p>"In my youth, I lived in the home of Governor Wang of the Northern Route of Tianshan in Xinjiang Province, and shared food and lodging with the Wang family for two years. Later, I invited Wang's grandson, Mr. Wang Jiaheng, to stay in my residence in Beijing. I had no ulterior motives in inviting Mr. Wang to stay with me. I was very frank with him, praising what was good and condemning what was bad. Whenever he could not distinguish between right and wrong, I would correct him unceremoniously at any time. When he returned home, he told his family that Elder Hayashiide was really a good person, and there was no one else as enthusiastic as him. Because my teachings were well-intentioned, and I had no selfish motives in setting an example for him in his daily life."</p>
<p>"The British and Americans often despise the Chinese, considering them an inferior race, not as excellent as them. However, the Greater East Asia War launched by Japan is a war to practice morality. Comparing the traitor Chongqing, isn't the nature of this matter the same as my intention in teaching Mr. Wang Jiaheng? The purpose of the Greater East Asia War is to seek the independence and liberation of all the ethnic groups in East Asia, and to coexist and co-prosper in the position of a national cooperative body. Therefore, it is completely opposite to the aggressive thinking of the British and Americans. Although China has many great figures and is rich in national concepts, I hope that all Chinese people will further develop their national consciousness and understanding of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>Now that the new China has regained its sovereignty, it is not enough for only a portion of the intellectuals to care about national affairs, but the entire people must care together. This is my faithful advice to the Chinese nation in the transitional period." At this point, Mr. Hayashiide recalled the scenery of traveling the world in the early Showa era, and said with emotion:</p>
<p>"Wherever you go, in any country, in any place, children are always lovely, young people are always courageous, and girls are especially cute. Dishonesty and hypocrisy are annoying to everyone, and sincerity and integrity are always pleasing. What can move people and be moved by people is sincerity." China has a famous saying, "Where sincerity reaches, metal and stone will be opened." It can be seen how great "sincerity" is.</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Hayashiide said: "In a great country, its people must have a pure character and a national consciousness." (Ren Yunpeng: Translated from the February 28th issue of the Mainland News)</p>

<h3>The Municipal Public Education Center Will Be Opened to the Public Today; The Education Bureau Hosted Reporters Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Special Tax Vouchers for Cosmetics Should Be Affixed to Each Item</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Tax Bureau has long stipulated that temporary special tax vouchers for cosmetics should be affixed to the packaging of goods on a per-item basis. Recently, it has been found that cosmetics sold in the market do not have vouchers affixed, which is not in compliance with regulations. It is now stipulated that all manufacturers should affix vouchers to existing stocks of cosmetics and complete the process by the 15th of the 30th month. If anyone still fails to comply by the deadline, once discovered, they will be punished for tax evasion. In the future, new tax goods should be affixed with vouchers at any time and must not be evaded or concealed. In addition to sending separate letters to relevant guilds for reference and to instruct all branches to comply, the cosmetics industry manufacturers in this city are also required to comply. Within the stipulated time limit, each should check the unposted cosmetics in stock, clarify the list, go to the bureau to pay taxes and obtain certificates, and affix them on a per-item basis.</p>
<h3>Shen Bao Scholarship Fund Continues to Receive Donations</h3>

<h3>Postal Remittances to Commercial Area in Eastern Zhejiang May Be Realized in Mid-March</h3>
<p>Postal remittances to the commercial area in eastern Zhejiang are still pending due to the fact that the Shanghai Postal Administration and the postal services in the eastern Zhejiang postal area have not yet finalized the amount and procedures for remittances. However, postal circles observe that this matter should be realized in March.</p>
<h3>Buddhist Soup Kitchen Temporarily Suspended</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Buddhist Association's soup kitchen, located at the Guandi Temple on Zhaojia Road in Nanshi, has been greatly benefiting the poor since its establishment, distributing soup to more than 3,000 people every day. The distribution is allocated at 600 people per neighborhood, introduced by the neighborhood chiefs. Recently, due to the reorganization of soup tickets, the soup distribution will be temporarily suspended from today (the 1st). The soup distribution will resume after the soup tickets have been reorganized.</p>
<h3>Re-registration of Coal Stocks; Those Who Do Not Register Will Not Be Allowed to Move Their Coal</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Coal Industry Federation, in view of the fact that coal is an essential commodity for people's livelihoods, has always been very strict in managing the buying and selling of coal. It has been learned that in order to clarify the current amount of coal stocks, the Federation plans to re-register coal stocks. Yesterday, the Dazhong Coal Company sent a letter to the Shanghai Coal Retailers Association, requesting that members be notified to handle the registration. The original letter stated, "We have recently received a letter from the Shanghai Coal Federation stating that the registration of controlled coal has been conducted by your association since May of last year. However, as time has passed, there have been changes. As the situation has changed, it may not be consistent with the current situation. It is now planned to re-register. Please accurately investigate and fill in the current amount of uncontrolled coal owned by your members (or companies) in accordance with the attached form and submit it to our association before February 26th. If you do not apply for registration, you will not be allowed to move it afterwards. In addition to publishing a notice in the newspaper, we are sending this letter to inform you again. Please forward this letter to your members and urge them to obtain the registration form from our company as soon as possible and register before March 1st."</p>

<h3>Specific Progress on Sugar Rationing by Population; Three Types of Rationed Sugar Sold Together; Type A Merchants Re-registered, Grouped in Sets of Fourteen Households; Coarse Sugar, etc., Specifically Rationed to Confectionery and Biscuit Industries</h3>
<p>Following the Sugar Merchant Cooperative Business Office's approval by the military allocation authorities to implement sugar rationing by population, arrangements were made for the public and French concessions to have sugar purchase permits issued by the concession authorities. In other areas, such as Zhabei, Southwest Shanghai, and the various districts of the city, the cooperative would handle it themselves. The city's Type A retailers were given a deadline to re-register, divided into areas, and merged to handle the food needs of residents. It was stipulated that a group would consist of those allocated fourteen bags of sugar per month. The already registered retailers have been reviewed and divided, and 58 sugar firms have been designated to manage them.</p>
<p>Over One Thousand Retailers of Two Types</p>
<p>The count: (First District) Public Concession retailers, 82 Type A, 56 Type B; (Second District) Public Concession retailers, 110 Type A, 70 Type B; (Third District) French Concession retailers, 44 Type A, 39 Type B; (Fourth District) French Concession retailers, 193 Type A, 113 Type B; (Fifth District) Hongkou Zhabei retailers, 125 Type A, 55 Type B; (Sixth District) West Shanghai retailers, 61 Type A, 44 Type B; (Seventh District) Nanshi retailers, 58 Type A, 59 Type B. In total, across the seven districts, there are 1,109 retailers.</p>
<p>Bundled Sales No Different Than Using Beam Balances</p>
<p>After Type A retailers are divided and combined into groups, they will specialize in handling sugar rationing for households. Type B retailers will specialize in handling sugar needed for various industries' operations. It is expected that city-wide population-based rationing will be universally implemented starting March 11th, and sugar will be sold according to the newly established prices. As for the detailed rules for population-based rationing, the concession authorities and the cooperative will issue public announcements at that time. It is also heard that the sugar for population-based rationing will consist of three types: granulated sugar, brown sugar, and white sugar. No objections should be raised to bundled sales. The weighing equipment should be based on the sixteen-tael, fully calibrated equal-arm balance. As for coarse sugar and other sugars, they will be specifically allocated to Type B retailers for use in modifying and producing confectionery, biscuits, and for other business purposes. If retailers exceed the price limits, deduct quantities, or adulterate the sugar, purchasers are permitted to report and pursue the matter.</p>
<h3>Conserving Gas Consumption, Repeated Warning; If Limits are Again Exceeded, Supply Will Be Cut Off</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Gas Company authorities, in order to conserve gas consumption to meet wartime conditions, have repeatedly advised users to conserve usage. New users are temporarily not being accepted. In terms of conservation, the usage limit for users is determined by the amount used in the month with the highest usage last year. If the limit is exceeded, the excess portion will be charged multiple times. Since implementation this year, most users have been able to comply with the advice, but there are still some whose monthly consumption has not been able to meet the specified limit. The company authorities, in addition to charging multiple times the excess portion, have also issued warnings. If the same situation occurs again in the future, supply will be cut off.</p>
<h3>Silver and Money Businesses, Commercial Promissory Note Discount Agreements; Businesses May Agree with Their Banks and Firms to Circulating Discounts Using Goods as Collateral</h3>
<p>In addition to promoting commercial acceptance drafts and bank acceptance drafts, silver and money businesses will also allow for the establishment of agreements for discounting commercial promissory notes. All businesses that issue notes may enter into agreements with their banks and firms to handle discounting. The agreement stipulates the following: "The party establishing this pledge discount agreement, now invites a co-guarantor, and pledges the collateral listed on the back of this agreement to the bank or money firm, stipulating that within a limit of [amount] in national currency, the discounter will continuously and cyclically issue promissory notes to be discounted at the [bank/firm], and agrees to abide by the following clauses together with the guarantor."</p>
<p>Provide Goods as Discount Collateral</p>
<p>(1) The due date of the promissory notes issued by the discounter shall not exceed [number] days from the date of issue, but must expire no later than [date]. (2) The discount interest rate shall be calculated at a monthly rate of [percentage], but your bank may increase or decrease it at any time according to market conditions. (3) Your bank may notify the discounter at any time to stop discounting or reduce the discount limit. (4) The discounter and guarantor solemnly declare that the collateral listed on the back of this agreement, or to be delivered in the future, is wholly owned by the discounter, and no other party has any rights. If any disputes arise in the future, causing your bank to suffer losses, the discounter and guarantor shall be jointly and severally liable for compensation. (5) If the collateral is goods (or part of the goods), the quality and quantity stated on the bill of lading, warehouse receipt, etc., are guaranteed by the discounter and guarantor to be completely accurate. If it is later discovered that the quality does not match, the quantity is short, or the contents are false, regardless of whether the goods are stored in your bank's own warehouse or in another warehouse, the discounter and guarantor shall be jointly and severally responsible.</p>
<p>Material Transfer and Insurance Handling</p>
<p>(6) The discounter shall be responsible for paying the warehouse rent, taxes, and other expenses for the goods in the preceding article. If your bank believes that the goods must be moved to another warehouse, once the discounter is notified, the discounter shall bear the cost and immediately comply. In the event of any loss due to the relocation, the discounter shall voluntarily be responsible and shall not involve your bank. (7) The collateral shall be possessed by your bank. If registration, transfer, or other procedures are required, the discounter shall comply. All costs shall be borne by the discounter. (8) The collateral shall be insured by the discounter in your bank's name (or with your bank as the primary beneficiary) with the insurance company designated by your bank at the current market price for fire insurance. If your bank deems it necessary, it may also require the discounter to add war risk insurance or other insurance. All costs shall be borne by the discounter. All insurance policies and insurance premium receipts shall be submitted to your bank for safekeeping. In the event of an accident, your bank shall be entitled to directly receive compensation from the insurance company to offset the discount and advances. If the insurance compensation is insufficient, or even if no compensation is received, the discounter and guarantor shall still be jointly and severally responsible for immediately providing equivalent collateral or cash, and shall not attempt to evade responsibility on the grounds of accidental loss. If your bank believes that equivalent collateral must be provided before compensation is received, the discounter shall also comply.</p>
<p>Breach of Contract, Disposition of Collateral</p>
<p>(9) If the discounter neglects to register, transfer, move the warehouse, insure, or handle other procedures, or pay various expenses, your bank may handle or pay them on their behalf. The expenses paid on their behalf shall be immediately reimbursed by the discounter; otherwise, your bank may calculate interest at the interest rate specified in Article 2 of this agreement. However, your bank has no obligation to handle or pay on their behalf, and shall not be liable for any responsibility or loss as a result of not handling or paying on their behalf. (10) If the collateral is damaged or its price falls, or if there is a tendency for it to fall, the discounter and guarantor shall be jointly and severally responsible for immediately replacing or increasing the collateral. (11) When the discounter replaces or increases the collateral, its type and quantity must be approved by your bank. (12) If your bank permits the discounter to replace all or part of the collateral or retrieve part of the collateral, it is not necessary to notify the guarantor. The guarantor shall still be jointly and severally liable and shall not raise any objections. (13) The discounter authorizes your bank as the full agent for the sale or disposition of the collateral. This agreement also serves as proof of authorization. (14) If the discounter violates or fails to fulfill the terms of this agreement, or if the discounted promissory note is not paid upon maturity, or if your bank believes that there is a risk of non-payment, your bank may dispose of the collateral by selling it sooner or later, or in any other manner, without notifying the discounter and guarantor, and shall have no objection. However, your bank has no obligation to sell or dispose of it. If the market price falls without being sold or disposed of, all losses shall not involve your bank. All receipts issued to the discounter for the collateral shall be voided after the sale or disposition. All costs incurred as a result of the sale or disposition shall be borne by the discounter.</p>
<p>Immediately Make Up Any Shortfall in Repayment</p>
<p>(15) The proceeds from the sale or disposition of the collateral shall be used to offset the discounted note amount and various expenses. Your bank may also calculate overdue interest at the interest rate specified in Article 2 of this agreement. If the proceeds are insufficient to clear the debt, the discounter and guarantor shall be jointly and severally responsible for immediately making up the shortfall. However, if the discounter has other deposits or assets of any kind in any of your bank's branches that are known to your bank, your bank may also use these funds to offset the insufficient amount. All receipts issued to the discounter shall be voided, or the assets shall be sold or disposed of in accordance with the provisions of the preceding article to offset the insufficient amount. After the collateral and other funds and assets have been sold, disposed of, or offset, in addition to offsetting the discounted note amount and overdue interest and various expenses, if there is a surplus, your bank may also return it to or deduct it from other matured or unmatured amounts owed by the discounter to your bank, and the principal and interest on loans from other creditors guaranteed by the discounter at your bank. (16) If your bank transfers all or part of the collateral to a third party, the discounter and guarantor shall fulfill the terms of this agreement to your bank, and shall fulfill them in the same way to the third party to whom the collateral is transferred. (17) If any litigation arises as a result of this agreement, the litigation costs (including your bank's attorney fees) shall be borne by the discounter and shall not be evaded.</p>
<p>Guarantor Not Allowed to Withdraw Guarantee</p>
<p>(18) If the discounter violates or fails to fulfill the terms of this agreement, the guarantor shall be jointly and severally liable with the discounter for immediately repaying the discounted note amount, overdue interest, and various expenses in full. The guarantor shall not delay the fulfillment of the guarantee obligation on the pretext that the collateral has not been sold or disposed of, or that no enforcement has been made against all of the discounter's assets, or any other excuse, and voluntarily waives all rights of the guarantor under Section 24 of the Obligations Section of the Civil Code. (19) The guarantor shall not withdraw the guarantee before the discounted promissory note has been fully paid. Even if the guarantor has published a statement in the newspaper declaring withdrawal of the guarantee, the guarantee responsibility under this agreement shall remain valid. However, if your bank believes that it is necessary to replace the guarantor, the discounter shall comply immediately upon notification, and shall have no objection. (20) If there is more than one guarantor, they shall all be jointly and severally liable. (21) If the discounter and guarantor violate or fail to fulfill the terms of this agreement and your bank files a lawsuit, the discounter's and guarantor's domicile, residence, place of business, or nationality, regardless of whether they have changed, shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Chinese court in the location of your bank, and waive the right to object to the jurisdiction of the court. (22) The discounter and guarantor mentioned in this agreement</p>
<p>shall include their heirs, successors, assigns, legal representatives, or administrators. (23) In addition to the terms specified in this agreement, the discounter and guarantor shall comply with all regulations of the Shanghai financial industry that are currently in effect or may be changed in the future.</p>

<h3>Western Union Football League, First Division, Second Round; Donghua Wins Against Portuguese Merchants, One to Zero; Jia Youliang's Goal in the First Half Seals the Victory</h3>
<p>In the second round of the Western Union Football League, First Division, Donghua again faced the Portuguese Merchants Association at Jiaozhou Park yesterday. The audience numbered eight to nine thousand, and the atmosphere was lively. At 3:45 PM, referee Le Xiurong blew the silver whistle, and the game began. Donghua's lineup was exactly the same as reported in yesterday's newspaper. The Portuguese Merchants, however, had some changes due to the absence of Gaien, V. Erlong, A. Rocha Liao, and others. The goalkeeper position was filled by G. Su Ruo. The Portuguese Merchants showed promise at the beginning of the game, but fortunately, Donghua's defense was tight, and there were no mistakes. At six minutes, Jia Youliang and A Kui passed the ball to each other, and at the appropriate distance, Jia shot from afar. Bao Xiu Tuo took the lead in a counterattack, but it was unsuccessful. H. Ke Lasha dribbled past three defenders and suddenly shot, fortunately missing by a foot, avoiding disaster. After that, it was all Donghua's offense. A Kui, Shu Tang, and Long Hai attacked three times in succession, all of which were unsuccessful. Until the 44th minute, Cao Qinfang lobbed the ball, A Dai headed it, and Jia Youliang descended like a flying general, bringing both the ball and himself into the net, and the opponent's goal was breached. Donghua used this goal to seal the victory. Before long, the first half ended, with Donghua leading by one to zero. After the break, the Portuguese Merchants fought like cornered beasts. Bao Xiu Tuo and H. Ke Lasha repeatedly missed good opportunities. O. Lieveira once penetrated deep into the interior, but returned without success. Donghua seized the opportunity to attack. Xu Wenkui got the ball from the center line and shot from afar, missing. Youliang's shot again hit G. Su Ruo. Soon after, A Dai got a brilliant pass from Youliang and back-heeled it, hitting the crossbar and bouncing out, which was very regrettable. In the end, A Kui and Qinfang had many scoring opportunities, but unfortunately, due to poor ball luck, they were unable to break the opponent's goal again. Finally, the final whistle blew, and Donghua defeated the Portuguese Merchants with a score of one to zero.</p>

<h3>Special Compilation on Various Places in Southeast Asia, No. 5: A Record of the Vicissitudes of the East Indies (1)</h3>
<p>— Qiao Song</p>
<p>(1) Overview of the East Indies</p>
<p>The former Dutch East Indies is part of the Pacific volcanic belt. The island shapes are very irregular, and the depths of the seabed and the twists and turns of the coastline are extremely complex. The islands are generally mountainous, with many volcanoes. Java alone has 109 volcanoes. The highest is Mount Semeru, rising to 3,658 meters above sea level, erupting year-round. The Krakatoa volcanic island between Java and Sumatra was almost completely pulverized when it erupted in 1883, and the explosion was heard as far away as Australia. Plains are mostly found in coastal areas, such as the east coast of Sumatra, the north coast of Java, and the southwest coast of Borneo. The rivers are longer and larger in Borneo, such as the Kapuas River and the Barito River, while others are very small.</p>
<p>The East Indies archipelago is almost entirely below the equator, with a climate that is like summer all year round, with little change, but because it is surrounded by the sea, it is not too uncomfortable for people. The distribution of rainfall is such that north of the equator, May to September is the rainy season, and the rest of the time is the dry season, while the situation south of the equator is the opposite. The equator cuts right through the middle of the East Indies, but generally it is very humid. The influence of the monsoon is considerable, creating inconsistent, dry and humid periodic contrasts in the equatorial zone. For agriculture, the irregularity of the amount of rainfall often poses a danger. Fortunately, there are many rivers that, during the monsoon rainy season, expand sufficiently to become an important source of irrigation and water power.</p>
<p>From a political-geographic perspective, the former Dutch East Indies is located in the southeast of the Asian continent, between 6 degrees north latitude and 11 degrees south latitude, and between 95 degrees east longitude and 141 degrees east longitude, including all islands. It can generally be divided into the following archipelagos:</p>
<p>(1) Greater Sunda Islands: Sumatra, Java, Borneo (part), Sulawesi;</p>
<p>(2) Lesser Sunda Islands: Bali, Lombok (Lombok), Sumbawa, Flores, Sumba (Sandalwood), Timor (part), Sawu, Savu;</p>
<p>(3) Maluku Islands: Halmahera (Jailolo), Obi (Obira), Buru, Seram, Ambon, Sula, Misool, Waigeo, Banda, New Guinea (western half).</p>
<p>From Sumatra in the west to New Guinea in the east, the total area is 1,904,345.7 square kilometers (1937 survey), a distance greater than that from Shanghai to Tacheng (Xinjiang) in our country, 58 times greater than the Netherlands itself, 8 times greater than Japan proper, and occupying one-ninth of the entire equator.</p>
<p>The population of the East Indies, according to the survey of October 7, 1930, was 60,727,233, with a population density of only 31.9 people per square kilometer. If we include New Guinea, which has not yet had an accurate survey, then its density will be even sparser. 70% of the population lives in Java and Madura, where the population density is 315.6 people, while the other outer territories are only 10.7 people. The area, population, and density of Java and Madura and the outer territories are shown in the following table: (Unit area: 1 square kilometer, population and density: 1 person)</p>
<p>The total area of ​​New Guinea is 744,362 square kilometers, of which the area of ​​Dutch New Guinea is 382,140 square kilometers.</p>
<p>The indigenous people of the East Indies are the Malay race, accounting for about 97.38% of the total population. Among the foreigners, the Overseas Chinese are the most numerous, with more than 1.2 million, followed by Europeans and other Eastern peoples. Among the Europeans, the Dutch are the most numerous, and among the Dutch, people of mixed Dutch and Malay descent account for the majority. The population of each race according to the 1930 survey is listed below:</p>
<p>Japanese accounted for 74,000 people.</p>
<p>(2) Political Situation</p>
<p>The East Indies becoming a colony of Europeans and Americans has a long history of pain. Since the defeat of the Spanish Armada, Dutch colonists first sought to expand their interests in the East. In 1596, the Dutchman Cornelius Houtman led four ships, rounded the Cape of Good Hope in Africa, and arrived in Sumatra and Banten, and signed "friendly" treaties with the chiefs of the Javanese clan society. In 1598, the Dutch continued to send expeditions to the East Indies, establishing commercial institutions in Java and Johor, and organizing companies. In 1602, the Dutch East India Company (Dutch East Indies Co.), the most famous in the history of Eastern colonization, was established. In the same year, they also used force to expel the Portuguese from Banten, establish a trading house, and open up the Maluku passage. In 1603, they blockaded Goa, the Portuguese base in India, with a fleet, and at the same time attacked Spanish ships in the Philippine waters. After several wars, they finally obtained a base in Maluku in 1606. Ten years later, they established their position in the Spice Islands and the Malay Archipelago. Two years later, they built the city of Batavia in Java, which became the capital of the Dutch East Indies in the future. In 1623, the English left the East Indies and focused on the management of India. In 1641, the Dutch captured Portuguese-controlled Malacca, ending the Portuguese history of managing East Asia. In 1652, the Dutch had already colonized the Cape of Good Hope, establishing a base for connecting with the East. In 1658, they captured Portuguese Ceylon and extended their trade routes to Japan and China. At that time, the number of Dutch ships traveling to and from the South Seas was as many as 16,000, grasping the hegemony of the "King of the Sea" for a time.</p>
<p>The Dutch's management of the East at that time was mainly focused on trade rights, that is, using deception, intimidation, and other means to plunder all the resources of the natives with very little capital, obtain the greatest profits, and enable these colonists to live a life of extravagance. There was no ambition to establish a colonial empire. Therefore, the land they occupied, like the Portuguese, was limited to the coastal areas. For the indigenous people, they only knew how to plunder and deceive goods, but did not know how to develop the interior and carry out political and cultural colonial work, so the foundation was not deep. When faced with a strong enemy, there was a risk of collapse. For example, at the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century, when Napoleon dominated Europe and the Netherlands was annexed by France, the Dutch colonies in the South Seas were attacked by the British and completely fell into British hands. It was not until after Napoleon's death that Britain returned Java to the Dutch, and in 1824 exchanged Sumatra for Malacca, that the Dutch colonies in the South Seas were preserved. After the 19th century, the economy of the Netherlands itself underwent significant changes, and the colonial policy underwent a new transformation, and began to carry out modern colonial work on the Malay Archipelago, using cheap native labor to force the natives to grow rubber trees, coffee, sugarcane, etc., launching an even more cruel exploitation of the colonies.</p>
<p>The King of the Netherlands appointed a Governor-General to rule the East Indies. The Governor-General was also known as the Viceroy and had great powers. The term of office of the Governor-General is generally five years unless otherwise specified. Its powers are divided into legislative, administrative, and judicial, and are generally as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Legislation: The Governor-General's decrees and government regulations must be discussed and passed by the National Council. If a bill has been approved by the National Council but is not agreed to by the Governor-General, it shall be submitted to the King of the Netherlands. But in fact, the National Council is just an advisory body. The Chairman of the Council is appointed by the King, and there are 38 members, appointed by the Governor-General and elected by local councils, for a term of four years. However, Dutch, indigenous, Overseas Chinese, and Arabs all have the opportunity to be elected as members.</p>
<p>(2) Administration: The Governor-General is the highest administrative organ of the Dutch East Indies, assisted by the Dutch East Indies Council, the highest advisory body, and has great administrative power.</p>

<h3>Annihilating the Anglo-Americans' War Both Materially and Spiritually</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Tokufu Inoichiro</p>
<p>(1) The Three Stages of War Aims</p>
<p>Why are we fighting? Although there is no need to ask this foolish question again now, like "hunters chasing a deer, who lose sight of the mountain," we are so absorbed in the war that there is a risk of forgetting its original purpose. Therefore, it is necessary for us to raise this question, think deeply, and act decisively. For this reason, our authorities have designated the day of the Imperial Rescript, the 8th of the month, as a commemorative day to make the nation deeply aware. On the one hand, we must explain the purpose of the war to the world to make it clear that this war is unavoidable; on the other hand, we must ask our own consciences whether we have fulfilled our duties as subjects of the Empire and given our wholehearted effort.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Greater East Asia War has three stages: first, for the self-defense of the Imperial nation of Japan; second, for the liberation of the nations of East Asia; and third, for the construction of a new world order. These three stages are not mutually exclusive; viewed in a plane, they are a trinity; viewed in three dimensions, they are consistently connected across three levels.</p>
<p>Although there is no need to delve into the causes of the war now, we must understand that we did not enter the whirlpool of this war out of our own pleasure. We have made every possible effort to resolve all disputes through peaceful means; for the sake of peace, we are extremely willing to make compromises to the greatest extent possible. However, the United States—behind which, of course, Britain exists—has driven us helplessly onto the road of war.</p>
<p>There is no need to repeat the ins and outs now. In short, they want to seal Japan like a can, so that not even a breath of air can escape. First, they formed the ABCD economic encirclement to crush us. Second, they used military pressure to force us to submit without a fight. Finally, they demanded that we withdraw troops from China, not recognize the Empire of Manchukuo, not recognize the Nanjing government but only the Chongqing government; demanded that we abandon the Tripartite Alliance and return to the Nine-Power Treaty.</p>
<p>Things have reached this point, even someone who worships the Anglo-Americans would have to give up and abandon the idea, let alone a man of common sense from the Empire! Moreover, what has made us rise up with righteous indignation is not only the life-or-death issue of Japan, but the life-or-death issue of the 1.1 billion people of East Asia. If we were to submit to the Anglo-American orders once, then the 1.1 billion East Asian people would probably never have the opportunity to see the light of day again. Now, looking at the whole world with a broader perspective, the tyranny of the Anglo-Saxon race is simply trying to completely enslave the world's more than 2 billion people, just like the more than 300 million people of India! If they are allowed to do as they please, then the whole world will surely become the darkest living hell, without any doubt. Our allied countries—Germany and Italy—in Europe, are willing to risk their fate in one throw against the Anglo-Saxons' ambition to dominate the world, and this is by no means accidental.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the purpose of our war is first for ourselves, then for East Asia, and finally for the whole world. These three stages are consistently guided by the great righteousness of our Imperial Japan. Therefore, it is completely disrespectful to this war to view it as wanting to obtain rubber, tin, oil, or hemp, sugar, rice, wood, etc. These are the results of the war, but by no means the purpose.</p>
<p>(2) The So-Called War Aims of the Anglo-Americans</p>
<p>We dare to ask Roosevelt and Churchill, the holders of power in the Anglo-American countries, "For what reason do you insist on fighting Japan?" What exactly is their so-called war aim? The most eloquent people in the world are none other than the Anglo-Saxons. They can always come up with plausible reasons for anything, as the saying goes, "Even a robber has three points of reason," which is their description. However, they cannot give any definite reason for this war, not only to the enemy, but also to their own people, which makes them confused. This must be said to be an extremely strange phenomenon in recent times.</p>
<p>Of course, they are by no means completely silent. From August 9, 1941, for eleven days, during the first Roosevelt-Churchill meeting on the British battleship Prince of Wales, now algae debris in the Malayan Sea, the so-called Atlantic Charter's eight points were declared, announcing the postwar economy to the world. This is just like Wilson's Fourteen Points declared during World War I, completely based on wishful thinking. Even the people in their own countries feel that this kind of blank check is "daydreaming."</p>
<p>Afterwards, what they said about the purpose of the war was just raising empty issues such as the liberation of all nations and the establishment of racial equality, which were completely far from reality, as a temporary trick to deceive people. If they really wanted to implement the liberation of all nations and the establishment of racial equality, then why not apply it to the 16 million black people in the United States? Why not apply it to the 300 million people of India? Forgetting the reality under their feet and only writing abstract contracts is their specialty, but who will believe them? In particular, Roosevelt's calling this war "a war for survival" is even more unreasonable. If they don't treat Japan like a can, where else can they find a reason to destroy America?</p>
<p>They originally shouted for freedom and democracy, but we want to ask them, are they really free countries? Are they really democratic countries? Britain and the United States are known as the old homes of liberalism in the world, and Britain considers itself the head of liberalism. However, informed people often say, "Britain has freedom, but this freedom is only exclusive to a small number of landowning classes, the so-called gentleman class. Although they have all the freedoms, no one else in Britain enjoys freedom." Historians say, "In France, the king holds the power; in Spain, the priests hold the power; in Britain, the gentleman class holds the power." King John, who signed the Magna Carta, himself sighed, "Above me, there are still twenty-five supreme kings." The so-called twenty-five supreme kings refer to the committee organized by the twenty-five people who forced King John to sign the Magna Carta, as a consulting body for all politics.</p>
<p>Now, the power in Britain has been transferred from the hands of landowners to the hands of capitalists who emerged from the Industrial Revolution, although a few parts have been transferred to the hands of some laborers. However, Britain itself is not a free country, which is very clear. As for the United States, money is omnipotent, and freedom cannot be found anywhere else besides money.</p>
<p>Now, suppose we lose the war with Britain and the United States. Then, what treaties will they propose to impose on us when concluding the peace treaty? It is uncertain. However, on May 30th last year, the U.S. Civil War Memorial Day, Under Secretary of State Sumner Welles's speech listed the goals of the war as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Punish individuals, groups, and nationals responsible for the war.</p>
<p>(2) Establish a sufficiently long period of truce after the war, jointly to abolish the armaments of the aggressor countries.</p>
<p>(3) Before the establishment of a permanent institution for maintaining peace, the United States and its allies will maintain and exercise international police power.</p>
<p>(4) After the war, after completing the handling of economic and social problems, establish an international organization based on the United States and its allies to gradually determine the final conditions of peace.</p>
<p>(5) Regarding the construction of a postwar world order, the United States should act as a leader.</p>
<p>(6) The Pan-American organization should be continued (above according to Ambassador Kurusu's report)</p>
<p>If it is really implemented in this way, then we must bear a hundred times more humiliation and suffering than Germany after the First World War. Therefore, just taking this one thing into account, we must win this war. Recently, the Under Secretary of State also said, "We Americans are fighting to preserve our freedom and independence; to defeat those oppressors who want to dominate the world with violence and disbelief." But we want to ask, who dares to undermine the freedom and independence of the United States? The destroyer of this freedom and independence is the United States itself. They are the ones who bring torches and set fires everywhere, plunging the whole world into a state of turmoil.</p>
<p>(3) The Three Enemies of the Anglo-Saxons</p>
<p>The custom of the Anglo-Saxon race is to treat those who are superior to themselves, or who are about to surpass them, or who are on par with them, as enemies, and to give them a blow on the head. This was originally planned, and because habit becomes nature, it can now be seen as an instinctual behavior. In modern times, the first enemy of Britain and the United States is Germany, the second is Japan, and the third is the Soviet Union (formerly the Russian Empire).</p>
<p>The first enemy, Germany, was resolved in the First World War. The battlefield was limited to France and Belgium, and Britain itself did not suffer any damage. However, because of this war, Britain, which had always been a creditor of the world, became a debtor, and the hegemony of world finance was taken from London by New York. During the First World War, the United States made a fortune; Britain, however, had to deeply feel the so-called sadness of the victor. The second enemy, Japan, had once concluded the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, and the result was that Japan and Russia fought, and the two tigers fought each other, either dying or being injured, which greatly pleased the Anglo-Saxons. However, Japan raised its head along with the First World War. In order to subdue it, Britain and the United States reached their goal at the Washington Conference in February 1922. The third enemy, the Soviet Union, after the First World War, tried every means to destroy it, but finally failed and gave up.</p>
<p>Since then, the world has not progressed according to the wishes of the Anglo-Saxon race, but in the opposite direction. Germany, which had been defeated by them, has revived. Moreover, the Anglo-Saxons also helped Germany to revive. That is because France, an ally of Britain, quickly recovered after the First World War and united the small countries of Europe to become the leader. Therefore, the old temper of the Anglo-Saxons flared up, and in order to check France's rise, they suddenly extended a hand of sympathy to Germany. The Anglo-Saxon capital made Germany revive; the Germans know this fact more clearly than anyone else.</p>
<p>However, Germany's recovery far exceeded the expectations of the Anglo-Saxons. The nameless hero Hitler rose from the grass roots, led the German people, and vigorously strengthened the country. Only when the power of the Nazi Party swept across Germany did the Anglo-Saxons wake up. Therefore, they betrayed their former allies and now openly and secretly slandered Germany in many ways. However, they were outmaneuvered, and no matter what methods they tried, they were always countered by Führer Hitler. Reluctantly, they had to pull the Soviet Union as a partner, wanting to use it to contain Germany. However, as usual, they were repaid with Germany's preemptive strike. Just as the envoys of Britain and France jointly arrived in Moscow to solemnly discuss military agreements, the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact was suddenly disclosed, making them speechless and embarrassed.</p>
<p>They also drove Japan into a dead end of "a cornered rat biting a cat." Therefore, the Manchurian Incident occurred, which unexpectedly evolved into the China Incident. Regarding the China Incident, the Anglo-Saxons must be said to have been quite successful. Why? Because they made the Chiang Kai-shek faction a pet dog, barking at Japan, and used its barking as world opinion, wanting to punish Japan in the world's court.</p>
<p>But Japan was finally annoyed by this evil strategy, and saw that the Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy were able to sympathize with each other and understand each other. Therefore, the Anti-Comintern Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy was established, and they were about to proceed to the conclusion of a military agreement, but it was countered by the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact.</p>
<p>They wanted to regain from Japan what they had lost to the Soviet Union. Therefore, they desperately told Japan bad things about Germany, saying that Germany wanted to sell Japan, which were unfounded rumors, wanting to make the two major powers in the East and West turn against each other, so that the Anglo-Saxons' territory in East Asia would not be shaken.</p>
<p>However, heaven does not exclusively bless the Anglo-Saxons. The situation turned again, and instead made the relationship between Japan and Germany closer. Thus, in September 1941, the Tripartite Alliance between Japan, Germany, and Italy was finally established. In this way, their strategy of fighting poison with poison and controlling enemies with enemies was always frustrated, making them sigh, "Is this what is called destiny? Or is it not!"</p>
<p>(4) The Relationship Between Germany and the Soviet Union, and Between Japan and the Soviet Union</p>
<p>However, the nature of the Anglo-Saxons is stubborn. They still deceive themselves into thinking that although the Tripartite Alliance between Japan, Germany, and Italy has been established, it is only a treaty on paper. Japan's true heart is still with the Anglo-Saxons. If they put pressure on Japan, Japan will definitely submit as they expect. But their wishful thinking was wrong again, and as a result, the Imperial Rescript declaring war on Britain and the United States was finally issued on December 8, 1941.</p>
<p>The three enemies that the Anglo-Saxons have been dealing with for more than twenty years are now far more powerful than they were then. The Anglo-Saxons' calculations always go wrong. But now, what has allowed them to catch their breath is the German-Soviet war.</p>
<p>Germany originally regarded the Anglo-Saxons as the main enemy. But Germany felt that if it was to win a decisive battle with the Anglo-Saxons, it must first stand on invincible ground. The result was the German-Soviet war. For this purpose, Germany started to take over Ukraine, which is known as the granary of Europe; for this purpose, Germany started to control the Black Sea; and for this purpose, Germany reached out for the Caucasus, which is the oil-producing area. Although it has not been completely successful, there is great hope that it will be obtained soon.</p>
<p>However, Germany underestimated the strength of the Soviet Union, which made the war unexpectedly prolonged and difficult. But we always firmly believe that Germany will achieve its goal sooner or later. If there were no German-Soviet war, London would probably have become ruins long ago. Britain's ability to get a temporary reprieve can simply be said to be a gift from the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The Anglo-Saxons have other conspiracies. That is the Japanese-Soviet war. They may not necessarily love the Soviet Union and hate Japan, nor do they necessarily love Japan and hate the Soviet Union. What they hate is the communist Soviet Union, or the Empire that unites the eight corners of the world. It is probably not easy to distinguish. What they hate is a snake or an earthworm, let us not discuss that for now; but if they hate earthworms, they will certainly hate snakes; this is a definite metaphor.</p>
<p>In this way, they often incite ill feelings between Japan and the Soviet Union, and provoke mutual animosity. They do everything possible to cause incidents between the two countries; praying to heaven and praying to gods, thinking about this day and night, for this matter.</p>
<p>How has their demonic hand acted against Japan? Recalling the events of the past four or five years, one can understand half of it. Whether it is Japan or the Soviet Union, it is wise not to accept orders from Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>Only the people of a country can know the interests of their own country. Now, to engage in a Japanese-Soviet war would be clearly detrimental to both sides and bring no benefit. The Neutrality Pact between Japan and Russia, concluded by former Foreign Minister Matsuoka with the then Foreign Minister Molotov in Moscow in April 1941, was a very timely thing. As a result, orders from Britain and the United States were rejected, and both sides are still persisting.</p>
<p>(5) Be Wary of the Anglo-Americans' Slander and Dissension</p>
<p>In short, Japan has Japan's position; the Soviet Union has the Soviet Union's position. Their positions are by no means the same. But it goes without saying that neither country should dance to the tune of the Anglo-Saxons.</p>
<p>Recently, at the Casablanca Conference, Roosevelt and Churchill asked Stalin to attend, but were rejected, which simply declared their great failure to the world.</p>
<p>Originally, Churchill became a British cabinet minister after the First World War and was a proponent of denouncing the Soviet Union. He is a person who thoroughly hates the Soviet Union. As a representative of British capitalism, it is not surprising that Churchill hates the communist Soviet Union. At the same time, Roosevelt is also like this. Moreover, Churchill now says more clearly, "If it is an enemy of Nazi Germany, even if it is a devil, I will shake hands with him." He probably still regards Stalin as a devil, the same as before! But their position is that there is a need to shake hands with Stalin.</p>
<p>But Churchill wanted to shake hands, but Stalin did not respond. Churchill and Roosevelt, traveling across the ocean, came to the north coast of Africa and held a tea party there. Stalin, who should have been their guest, was absent, which must have made them feel lost! Assuming that Stalin had come, what would they have used to start the conversation? In any case, they would always choose various topics to provoke a Japanese-Soviet war, which can be asserted.</p>
<p>But Stalin would never dare to do so, being unable to cope with Germany alone, let alone being enemies with Japan. He distinguishes between sweetness and bitterness one by one. There is no need to question whether he is showing goodwill to Japan; now is no longer the time to fight with Japan, he should know this very well. Like them, being so bored and empty-headed, just making empty invitations, is really like the so-called ghost seeking a partner. From this point of view, it is not difficult to imagine how the Anglo-Saxons are trapped in a desperate situation.</p>
<p>But the Anglo-Saxons will never give up. No matter how they are pushed into a corner, they always know how to dodge. They tell Japan about the difficulties of the German-Soviet war, that Germany is trapped in a dilemma from which it cannot retreat, and how dangerous it is to trust Germany. They also tell Germany that Japan's economy is trapped in self-imposed restrictions, and it has no way to extricate itself, and can only submit to the Anglo-Americans, making Germany doubt Japan's strength, and at the same time making Japan doubt Germany's strength.</p>
<p>On the other hand, they say that Germany may be preparing for a diplomatic somersault at any time, telling Japan that Germany is untrustworthy. They also say that Japan has taken all the resources of the South, easily seizing the spoils, making Germany suffer in battle, provoking Germany's suspicion of Japan. By playing with various despicable means like this, they do their utmost to sow discord and slander between Japan and Germany, vainly trying to create cracks in the unwavering alliance.</p>
<p>Both Japan and Germany have long seen through these means. We now sincerely advise Roosevelt, Churchill, and his ilk: you should stop this boring and unnecessary slander and dissension.</p>
<p>The Anglo-Saxons' demonic hands first launched against Italy. They attempted to pull Italy away from Germany, isolating Germany in Europe. The wise Prime Minister Mussolini first strengthened Italy's wartime state and decisively reorganized the cabinet, giving them an eloquent response. As long as Mussolini exists in Italy, it will never leave the Tripartite Alliance.</p>
<p>Our Tripartite Alliance between Japan, Germany, and Italy will resolutely complete this war for the purpose of establishing a new world order at the beginning. In Germany and Italy, prohibition and other measures have been strictly enforced to strengthen the wartime state. Therefore, Japan must be even more tense, and the entire nation must respond with the spirit of standing on the front line and being active. We now repeat without fear: the purpose of Japan's war is the self-defense of the Empire, the liberation of East Asia, and the construction of a new world order, with the three stages consistently and integrally united. To achieve this goal is by no means a trivial matter; we must use the spirit of frightening gods and opening gold and stone, and devote all our efforts to implement it decisively.

<h3>Strange Phenomena in the Upper Atmosphere</h3>
<p>— Original by Ichiro Torikai</p>
<p>Report from the Summit Laboratory on Mt. Hotaka</p>
<p>Aviation Medicine</p>
<p>The mainstay of modern weaponry is the airplane, but no matter how many or how excellent the airplanes are, without the human power to fly them, they will never produce brilliant battle results. The fact that the Japanese Army Air Corps is constantly accumulating training is what has attracted the attention of people around the world. At the same time, aviation medicine has emerged in response to this.</p>
<p>On mountain peaks towering into the clouds, various phenomena occur in the human body due to low air pressure, such as altitude sickness and mountain sickness, which are well-known to the general public. This has only been a concern for those who climb mountains, and has not attracted the attention of the general public.</p>
<p>However, for aviation personnel who fly at high or extremely high altitudes, it is of course necessary to pay special attention to medical research in this area.</p>
<p>Therefore, on the 1st of last month, the government announced the establishment of an Aviation Medicine Research Institute within Nagoya Imperial University, with two professors, two assistant professors, and four assistants as the core, to specifically explore this academic theory and its applications.</p>
<p>Air Pressure and Intelligence Examination</p>
<p>Even before the establishment of this new research institute, students at the Imperial University had already achieved some success in the field of aviation medicine research. Last summer, a mountain laboratory was established on the summit of Mt. Hotaka in the Japanese Alps, at an altitude of 3,190 meters, centered around students from the Katsunuma Internal Medicine Laboratory, to diligently experiment with the physiological state of high-altitude flight technicians.</p>
<p>At high altitudes, things often happen that people living on the ground cannot imagine. The first is the narrowing of the field of vision.</p>
<p>Generally, people with healthy eyes take in a considerable amount of things to the left and right when looking straight ahead; however, once ascending to an altitude of 3,000 meters, the same person's field of vision narrows significantly, sometimes resembling a horse pulling a cart with blinders on, completely unable to see to the left or right. This change is measured in terms of field of vision, but it is an extremely important study, as the pilot's field of vision and the design of the aircraft are related.</p>
<p>In addition, many climbers were gathered at the Hotaka hut, and simple intelligence tests were conducted first, immediately proving that in places with low air pressure, the mind's ingenuity becomes dull. Consider the questions from the national school graduation exam: "○○ runs faster, and among things that can be ridden, ○○ is the fastest." Any ordinary elementary school student can immediately answer that the first two ○○ are "train" and the last two ○○ are "airplane." However, at an altitude of 3,000 meters, the brains of university students are inferior to those of elementary school students, and they strangely cannot answer such simple questions. For example, when asked to write numbers backward from one thousand to nine hundred and fifty, there would be many errors, and it would be impossible to find a completely correct answer.</p>
<p>Weakened Work Efficiency</p>
<p>Studying work efficiency at high altitudes is also a topic in aviation medicine. First, keep the wrist still and have the index finger rotate at a constant speed. A special machine is used to measure the fatigue caused by the rotation, and a graph is created with curves, which is then compared to the same person performing the same action on the ground. It can then be known that exercise performed at high altitudes is far more tiring than exercise performed on the ground. In addition, students are made to run straight on the mountain peak and then return to the laboratory, where their blood is immediately examined. It can then be understood that fatigue factors such as lactic acid and light gas are three times more abundant than during exercise on the ground.</p>
<p>When designing aircraft, special attention should be paid to how to simplify piloting, because intelligence decreases at high altitudes, and mechanical movements are more easily fatiguing than on the ground.</p>
<p>In addition to these, there are many other changes in the body at high altitudes. The sense of taste also becomes extremely dull. An ordinary spoonful of sugar is enough to sweeten a cup of water, but at an altitude of 3,000 meters, no sweetness can be felt at all, and it cannot be distinguished from ordinary water. The same is true for bitter and sour tastes. Even the best dishes on the ground become bland and tasteless when taken to high altitudes.</p>
<p>Since we have talked about eating, let's talk about some related things. At an altitude of 3,000 meters, water boils at 76 degrees Celsius because of the low air pressure. Therefore, rice cannot be cooked properly in a pot without a large stone pressing down on the lid. It is said that this is a very painful thing for the research team on the mountain.</p>
<p>In addition, the sensation of the skin is also surprisingly dull at high altitudes. For example, if two needles are pricked into the skin one inch apart on the palm, it is impossible to feel that there are two needles.</p>
<p>Cultivation and Aptitude of Air Force Personnel</p>
<p>Experiments are also conducted using centrifugal sedimentation devices. This is to study the changes that occur in the human body during subtle flight maneuvers, dive bombing, and rapid descents, as well as when suddenly restoring the aircraft to its original flight path.</p>
<p>When we are in an elevator in a department store, going up or down, we always have an unpleasant feeling. This is because the inertia of the blood wants to flow down from the head or flow back up. Similarly, but several times stronger in an airplane, it is certainly different. Rapidly descending 1,000 meters from a high altitude and then pulling the plane up can really make one dizzy. The centrifugal sedimentation device is used to explore this physiological phenomenon.</p>
<p>Another important thing is aptitude testing. For example, climbers are asked to answer fifty questions on paper, such as "Do you worry about trivial matters?" "Do you make quick decisions?" "Do you indulge in fantasies?" Based on their answers, they are judged to be extroverted or introverted. Then, it is investigated whether extroverted or introverted people are more suitable for high altitudes.</p>
<p>Very interestingly, the results of this investigation prove that excellent climbers are all introverted and have highly cautious personalities. The reason for the excellence of the aviation technology of the Germans, who have introverted, cautious, and calm personalities in Europe, lies in this.</p>
<p>According to this aptitude investigation, it is extremely valuable data for cultivating aviation personnel and judging their suitability.</p>
<p>In addition, various experiments have been conducted on changes in blood pressure at high altitudes, or on metabolism, which of course also provide many hints about the relationship between high altitudes and the human body.</p>
<p>However, although this experiment on the summit of Mt. Hotaka is at a high altitude, it has many different conditions than on an airplane. Therefore, it is doubtful whether the results of this experiment can be fully applied to aviation medicine. Strictly speaking, being on an airplane and being on the summit of a high mountain are completely different. However, since there are many similarities in principle, it is of course possible to extrapolate from this to some extent.</p>
<p>In short, aviation medicine is still in its infancy. Although universities other than Nagoya Imperial University have also begun to conduct research, the main work is always simply and one-sidedly left to specialized researchers. It should be broadened and deepened. In order to promote the development of Japan's aviation industry, we eagerly look forward to future achievements in this area.

<h3>Darwin Advocated Education from Childhood</h3>
<p>— Jia Sun</p>
<p>After traveling around the world several times and peering into the mysteries of biology, Darwin immersed himself for decades and completed the world-shaking "Origin of Species," the theory of evolution. As his reputation grew, more and more people came to visit his laboratory.</p>
<p>Once, a young and beautiful lady, holding a lovely child in her arms, had the following conversation with Darwin:</p>
<p>"Oh, what a beautiful child! How old is he?"</p>
<p>"Just two and a half years old."</p>
<p>"Hehehe, very interesting."</p>
<p>He said it was cute, and the lady happily said, "I definitely plan to raise him into a top-notch figure... I came to consult you about this."</p>
<p>"What is it?"</p>
<p>"When is the best time to start this child's education?"</p>
<p>Then Darwin smiled and replied:</p>
<p>"Madam, it's a pity, but your beloved is already one and a half years old, and it's too late."</p>
<p>This lady was rebuffed by Darwin. Although Darwin's attitude that it is "too late" to start education at the age of two and a half (equivalent to the Chinese age of four) may not be correct, it is enough to show the importance of the timing of education. Since the innate upbringing was not paid attention to, and the education during infancy and early childhood was neglected, it is no wonder that Darwin, from a biological perspective, considered it "too late."</p>
<p>Biology tells us that the environment and upbringing during the period from the embryo's development to maturity are enough to determine everything about the organism's future. The upbringing during infancy and early childhood has a far greater impact on the future than we imagine. Many habits, thoughts, and behaviors can be traced back to the upbringing during our infancy. Therefore, the saying "What you are at three, you'll be at eighty, what you are at eight, you'll be for life" does indeed have its scientific basis.</p>
<p>Usually, we don't pay too much attention to children's words and actions because they are still young, thinking they don't count, and always forgiving them. But this is a very dangerous mistake, like a spark that can start a prairie fire in the future. It should be corrected as early as possible, otherwise it is inevitable to leave behind the regret of "it's too late."</p>
<p>Respectable fathers and mothers! The education of your children does not begin when they enter school. Education during infancy is far more important than education at university in the future. For the sake of your children's future achievements and happiness, please start paying attention to it immediately.</p>

<p>A girl at home, moving within a narrow world, may seem to others that housework is tedious and life is boring. However, I am content with this and feel that my life is filled with work, health, peace, and joy. Therefore, I write down my daily routine:</p>
<p>Every day, every day, when the sun has not yet reached the roof ridge, the tiles are covered with a thin layer of frost, the morning mist is pervasive, the surrounding outlines are blurred, and the atmosphere is quiet. At this time, our hen should be getting up. Afterwards, I give her a hearty breakfast – a bowl of water and a plate of chopped rice mixed with bran – and also clean her house and weave a straw mat. However, we repay each other's kindness. In the afternoon, she proudly crows, "Cluck, cluck, cluck!" Then, my joy comes: a warm, large egg, quietly placed on the straw mat. The next day, the egg is mixed with soybean milk, which is my mother's breakfast. After settling the hen, I take a deep breath in the fresh air for a while, and then write yesterday's diary. I record everything that happened and everything I felt in detail. I handle the family's internal affairs and also serve as an external worker. After cleaning up the room, I go to the vegetable market. Due to the daily rise in vegetable prices, the money I am allocated each day for vegetables is really difficult to spend. This forces me to adopt a tight policy, with both quantity and quality being affected.</p>
<p>Our meals emphasize both rice and coarse grains, and there are many varieties: yellow corn flour, red adzuki beans, and brown rice. Each is cooked with two-thirds white rice. In the evening, it is usually noodles, red bean porridge, or vegetable porridge, which includes sweet potatoes, taro, carrots, green vegetables, and broken rice. In the afternoon, I wash clothes, sew socks and clothes for my family, or wipe the floor.</p>
<p>The twilight lamp is the quietest time of the day. I knit and read, but these are not novels of the kind that are trending towards low-grade tastes for leisure. These books contain truth and are full of admonitions. In this difficult and extraordinary era, I can especially appreciate the sincerity of those good words. When I am inevitably enveloped in a state of frustration, this will give me much encouragement, increase my inner strength, guide me towards good, and prevent me from being saddened or gladdened by material things.</p>
<p>I don't wear makeup or perm my hair. My clothes are mostly old. Although I also associate with a group of young ladies, I don't envy their new clothes and leather coats. If they only value their clothes, then I don't need this kind of false friendship. It has been 417 days since I last stepped into a movie theater or theater, because I don't need to receive any education or want to appreciate the tragedies and comedies of "Darling!" "Sister!" Usually, household chores give me the most exercise, so my body's development is balanced and healthy.</p>
<p>In my spare time, I also amuse myself. The floating clouds in the clear sky, the clear light of the moonlit night, the morning light, the sunset, the mysteries of nature, and its constant changes give me a subtle sense of beauty. Occasionally, I also sing a song to express my emotions. I love being alone the most. After I have spent a time in deep thought, I will receive a better revelation in my spirit.

<h3>Strange Customs of Western Sichuan</h3>
<p>— Huai Zhi</p>
<p>How Do the Qiang People Pray for Rain?</p>
<p>In the territory of Lifan County, Western Sichuan, the various border people who live there each have their own different ways of praying for rain. The Jiasu tribe relies entirely on lamas chanting scriptures, so their methods are relatively uniform. As for the Qiang people, they are disorganized. Although they are one ethnic group, their ways of praying for rain often vary from place to place. What is introduced here is the legend and methods of praying for rain in Longxi Village.</p>
<p>Longxi Village is a village in the Qiang area, located in the east of Lifan County, along the left bank of the Zagu River. The village head is called Chen Guangming. The legend of praying for rain in this village originates in Chen Guangming's family.</p>
<p>It is said that thirty years ago, a girl from the Chen family wandered in the mountains and fields, and a bee often followed her. The girl told her parents about it, and the parents said, "Why not just follow the bee to explore?" The girl did as she was told and was indeed carried away by the bee to a sea, where she married the Dragon King. This girl is today Chen Guangming's aunt. After Chen's family lost their daughter, they searched everywhere and found the hemp thread she had taken with her when she went out, by the sea, and then knew her whereabouts. It is said that in those years, whenever there was a drought, the villagers would gather by the sea, crying and shouting, and sacrificing sheep to the sea, and then it would rain. This formed their fixed way of praying for rain.</p>
<p>Three years later, the Chen family held a wedding, and the girl suddenly returned, carrying a wooden box, instructing her mother not to open it. The mother was curious and, taking advantage of her daughter's absence, opened the box and examined it, discovering two small dragons lying inside. The two small dragons thought they were going to be fed milk, and stretched out their heads. The mother was greatly startled and pinched the two dragons to death. The girl knew that disaster was unavoidable. When parting, she instructed her mother to ask her family to go to the sea to watch. If bubbles appeared on the sea, it meant that she had returned to the Dragon King and was beginning to suffer. If the water was red, it meant that she was being tortured. If the water was calm, it meant that she was dead. After the girl left, her family went to the sea to watch, and it gradually came true. After a few years, the sea dried up, leaving only a dry sea on the back mountain thirty miles away from Longxi Village.</p>
<p>The way of praying for rain has also changed because of this. Whenever there is a drought, Chen's descendants must be taken to the edge of the dry sea, and the villagers all beat them angrily until they wail in pain. This shows the villagers' dissatisfaction with the Chen family, so that the Dragon King punishes them, and then the rain will fall. This has been passed down for decades. In recent years, every time they pray for rain, they take Chen Guangming to be beaten. This year was originally a major drought, and Chen, the village head, should have been punished. It is said that after Chen Guangming set off with the crowd, he actually fled back alone, so the people in the village are very dissatisfied with him, believing that the failure to get early rain this year is due to Chen Guangming's unwillingness to sacrifice himself for the public. They have never considered the natural conditions of the earth. Legends and witchcraft still dominate their minds and actions (Remuneration for Relieving Poverty</p>

<h3>Written Before "Friends' Day"</h3>
<p>— Xiepusheng</p>
<p>Mr. Huang Jingwan's "Three-Three Friends' Day," which he pioneered, is coming soon! Friends are one of the five human relationships: sovereign and subject, father and son, siblings, husband and wife, and friends. No one can live in this world without these five relationships. As the saying goes, "At home, rely on your parents; when away from home, rely on your friends." Friends have trust, friends have righteousness, friends can help you succeed in your career; friends can relieve your suffering; friends can discuss learning with you; friends can faithfully advise you on your mistakes; as the saying goes, "Within the four seas, all are brothers." This is from the perspective of good friends. As for: having money means having friends, and having no money means being strangers. Friends built on money are just drinking buddies! There is no morality, no faithfulness, especially in this turbulent world and when people's hearts are changing greatly. Friends cheat and deceive each other, and things are unpredictable. There are those who sell out their friends for glory, those who embezzle their friends' wealth, those who kick them when they're down, and all kinds of immoral inducements that make you fall into the abyss and unable to extricate yourself. The way of friendship has been lost, and it is especially intense now! Therefore, Shen Simin and Feng Yunchu of the Chinese Confucian Society, in view of the rampant human desires and the overwhelming number of friends who harm others and benefit themselves, are actively advocating for thick morals and regularizing the way of friendship. The slogan for promoting the way of friendship is "Choose your friends wisely, trust your friends, be loyal in your duties, and be forgiving to others." The ancient saying goes, "Those who respect others are always respected by others, and those who love others are always loved by others." Friendship cannot stand without trust, so loyalty, faith, sincerity, and respect are important. In addition, having no one to share with (friends have the responsibility to share wealth), supporting each other in sickness, going through thick and thin together, and sharing each other's pain are the most important elements of friendship. Guan Zhong and Bao Shuya sharing gold, and Yang Jiaoai and Zuo Botao sacrificing their lives for friendship are enough to influence the world. Pine, bamboo, and plum are the three friends of winter, eternally immortal, and are the best examples. I hope to encourage readers together.</p>
<h3>Depressed Life</h3>
<p>— Mu</p>
<p>Rice as precious as pearls, firewood as expensive as cassia, and skyrocketing prices mean that all of us common people, who could originally make ends meet and balance our income and expenses, are now struggling to make ends meet, burdened with debt, and living by pawning and mortgaging, which has become a common phenomenon.</p>
<p>Before the war, a family of four could live comfortably on a monthly income of sixty, half of which was used for food, and after paying the rent, the remainder was enough to cover miscellaneous expenses. But now, income is mostly around one thousand, and even buying grain and rice is not enough, let alone anything else!</p>
<p>The plight of salaried workers is hard to describe in a word. If they encounter unexpected setbacks, illnesses, or successive deaths, it is really impossible to cope. Anxious, at their wit's end, and completely exhausted, the tragedy is indescribable in words. The situation in which they live, the so-called salary, is just like a drop in the bucket!</p>
<p>It is said that members of a certain organization are often forced by circumstances, and the weak ones frown, are decadent, and moan. They have no interest in doing things and no spirit to work hard. The cunning ones advocate for slowdowns, demand salary increases, or instigate others to waste water and electricity and squander stationery as a passive resistance and intangible destruction. Others know how to take advantage of their position to engage in embezzlement and abuse of power, acting in a hundred treacherous ways for personal gain and violating public interests. Economic loopholes are deep and significant, and administrative efficiency is also rapidly weakened.</p>
<p>However, the authorities often attribute this to huge expenses that they cannot afford, or use the extravagance of a small number of employees as an excuse to ignore the hardships of most colleagues, turning a deaf ear and pretending to be ignorant, causing some capable personnel to waver, see different things and move their hearts, and use the talents of Chu in Jin, which is not a great loss of talent?</p>
<p>Therefore, for the sake of the overall situation, those in charge should be aware of the poor circumstances of their subordinates, consider improving their treatment, and ensure that they focus on their jobs and do not think of moving. Those below should also appreciate the difficulty the authorities have in earning money, abide by their duties, do their best, and strive to be thrifty and tide over the difficulties together. If this is the case, then both sides will benefit, and the progress of social undertakings will truly depend on it.</p>
<h3>Preface to "Diary" Writing</h3>
<p>— Qiyun</p>
<p>I didn't want to write a "diary" at first, thinking it was a very troublesome thing; besides, my temperament is very lazy.</p>
<p>But recently, I seem to find that I often get a lot of feelings from small things, resulting in a day of depression or a day of joy; however, this kind of depression or joy produced by feelings is actually a person's "experience." It is very valuable and necessary to record it; so from today I made the determination to write a "diary."</p>
<p>I have to write a motto here to encourage myself: Writing a diary requires "perseverance."</p>
<h3>Teacher for All Ages</h3>
<p>— Written by James Hilton, Translated by Yi Jin</p>
<p>(18)</p>
<p>Old Buffles smiled and said, "It's nothing, old chap—nothing—we were wondering when you were going to wake up from that nice sleep."</p>
<p>"But—er—I heard you—you were talking about me—"</p>
<p>"Absolutely nothing of the sort, my dear fellow! Really, I give you my word. …"</p>
<p>"I thought I heard you—one of you—saying it was a pity—er—pity I hadn't—a child... wasn't it? … But I have, you know... I have..."</p>
<p>They were all laughing, without answering him, and after a pause Chips began again, feebly and tremulously garrulous.</p>
<p>"Yes—er—I have," he quavered with the tremulous chuckle. "Thousands of 'em... thousands... and all boys."</p>
<p>Then the chorus swelled in his ears once more, bigger and more lovely than he had ever heard it, and more comforting. … Batford, Bridewell, Briarley, Borrow, Blades—Anderson... Better listen, now, my lads—now listen to a last word from your old schoolmaster... at my time of life... Carterley, Crayke, Dabney, Davidson... and now I'm going to tell you a joke …and you must laugh. … Habberley, Hastlett, Hatfield, Hazelby … My last joke …you'll like it … Bonn, Boston, Bowyer, Bradford, Bradley, Brocklehurst—Anderson … Where are you all … what are you all doing … this is your last chance … Good-bye, my boys. …</p>
<p>Not long afterwards Chips dozed off.</p>
<p>He seemed so peaceful that they did not disturb him to say good night; but in the morning, as the School bell was ringing for breakfast, Brookfield got the news. "Brookfield will never forget his lovableness," Cartright said in his speech to the School. Which was untrue, of course, because everything is forgotten in the end. But Linford, at any rate, would remember and tell the story : "I said to Chips, only the night before he died …" … (   )  Social Service</p>
<h3>Lost Child Found - A Parent's Lesson</h3>
<p>(Letter Received) After my child went missing from school, I searched everywhere, but there was no trace of him. I thought it would be difficult to find him, but luckily, after he got lost, he fell into the hands of the public concession police, who took him in. After a full three days, I was able to bring him back and reunite with him. I really troubled my relatives and friends, and I am very uneasy.</p>
<p>I have a few feelings about this matter:</p>
<p>First, I should express my sincere gratitude to the Public Concession Bureau's Child Protection Section and the Morality Section of the Police Station for their enthusiasm. If my child had unfortunately fallen into the hands of bad people, then even if he could be found, the suffering he would have endured would be difficult to imagine.</p>
<p>Second, parents should always be vigilant to prevent young children who do not know the way from getting lost. It is best to write their name and address inside their clothes so that those who take them in can identify them if they unfortunately get lost. However, this method only applies to good people. Therefore, when young children go out, they should not only be accompanied by older people, but also have strict protective measures. I was shocked to see so many lost children in the Bureau and the Police Station. I hope that citizens will be especially cautious in the future.</p>
<p>Finally, I hope that all elementary schools with lax security measures will take measures to prevent young children from leaving on their own. If ordinary citizens encounter lost or abducted young children, they should immediately report them to the police. In this way, with the concerted efforts of all parties, unfortunate things can be gradually eliminated.</p>
<h3>Simple Phlegm Removal Method</h3>
<p>— Shi Jiyun</p>
<p>Spitting phlegm everywhere is indeed most unhygienic and unrefined; moreover, nothing affects public health more than this. This kind of bad habit not only requires the authorities to strictly prohibit it, but also everyone to automatically and thoroughly eradicate it.</p>
<p>Examining the source of phlegm and nasal mucus, there are no more than two causes: namely, internal and external causes. External causes are occasional colds and flu, where the throat feels itchy, the trachea becomes inflamed, secretions suddenly increase, and coughing phlegm is produced as a result. Internal causes are due to a weak stomach, and a fondness for fatty meats, dried fish, crabs, snails, and other foods that are greasy, cold, and difficult to digest. Thus, the spleen loses its ability to function properly, and how can phlegm and dampness not arise internally?</p>
<p>If you want to get rid of this bad habit, you should consult a doctor for diagnosis and treatment to eliminate the root cause. If you cannot afford treatment, and you encounter an external cold with phlegm, you may wish to purchase and take Buddha's Compassion Apricot Kernel Essence. For those who usually have a lot of phlegm and nasal mucus (i.e., phlegm from internal causes), taking Er Chen Wan (Two-Cured Pill) is excellent. The above two medicines have gentle and non-biased medicinal properties, a great ability to remove phlegm, and are very economical. For those with lung disease who produce a lot of phlegm, it is best to take cod liver oil pills to make the lungs healthy and the phlegm will disappear on its own. This is truly a fundamental way to remove phlegm.</p>
