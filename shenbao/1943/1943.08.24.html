<p>社評</p>
<h3>急待解決的糧食問題</h3>
<p>自從政府公布收買棉紗棉布命令以後，一小部分物價雖吿下落，但與民生關係最重要的米糧價格，却並未下跌。我們可以斷言，如果米糧價格也能下跌，那末一般物價，必定可以全面下跌。根據過去的事實經駖，各種物價的上漲及其速度，是極不正常的，有時以米價爲中心而隨其上昇，有時却不依米價而同時下落。但是米價的漲落對於其他物價發生主要的景響作用，也是無可否認的。</p>
<p>不過，到了今天，如果放棄經濟學理上的解釋，純以事實作分析，可以證明「食」—就是米—與「衣」—就是紗布—兩大民生日用品價格，均爲一切物價的中心，但各自發生主要作用，如果「食」與「衣」兩項價格漲落一致，則一切物價的漲落也全面一致。如果「食」與「衣」兩項價格漲落不一致，則一切物價的漲落也不全面一致。譬如過去米價回跌，而紗布不跌，於是若干物價隨之下跌，若干物價並不下跌，結果使米價又被動的回漲。現在紗布回跌了，而米價不跌，也是若干物價下跌，若干物價並不下跌。現在如望一切物價全面下跌，必先促使米價下跌，俾與紗布下跌取得一致。</p>
<p>我們上面的分析，如果不背事實，那末，要求物價全面下跌，就不能不先要求米價下跌。我們首先要問：在六七月之交，米價爲什麼上漲幾達一倍？戶口米爲什麼要減少與延期。關於後者，雖有昨天報戰大通社消息，但所傳理由，主管者實不能辭其責任，如果這兩個問題不能解決，將使人民莫大失望，而有漲到幾何？延到何時？减到多少的感想？</p>
<p>一般的推想，所以如此的原因、，當爲：　交通阻滯，運輸不能暢達：　米糧產量的不足；與　辦理未盡得法，處置未盡完善，所謂「人謀不臧」者。補救這三個缺點，我們認爲：</p>
<p>交通運輸方面，應請友邦日本盡量協助，我們盼望友邦人士在中日合作的遠大目光下，絕對重視中國人民食的問題，中國古賢說過「民以食爲天」的話，可見人民對於食的重要，實無有出其右者。對於供應民食的米粉運輸，主管糧食機關，應有完整的管理權與指揮權。</p>
<p>糧食產量不足，自爲病根，增加食糧生產，早已定爲國策，只須有關主管機關籌定整個計劃，及早實施。我們大家就先利用荒地空地隙地等，盡量栽植米麥及雜糧，以補不足。</p>
<p>如果在辦即不善者，那末，我們主張從速調整機構，認清民食問題的絕對重要性，不測因循坐誤。况全國商衆統制總會為商業自治性的唯一經濟統制機關，則辦理食糧統制，似爲應有之職責。目前管理米糧機構，旣未能辦理盡善，自以歸併商業統制總會接辦，以專責成。或由商業統制總會遴選社會公正人士主持辦理。務使民食問題得到合理解決。</p>
<p>江浙兩省尤其上海附近一帶，都是產米豐庶之區，如果這一區的米糧調劑，束手無策，那末，民食前途，漫無把握，物價狂漲，社會不安，潛伏於此，實太危險了。我們於擁護政府收買紗布政策以後，不得不督促政府重視民食，從速決定糧食政策，充實統制機構，改進收買與配給方法。調節民食，安定民生，實利賴之！</p>

<h3>東綫戰爭趨勢</h3>
<p>東部戰綫的推移，隨着義大利戰局的嚴重化而緊張起來。所以東部戰綫與歐洲戰局全體實息息和關。英美在義國方面，蘇聯在東部戰綫方面，雖各自發動對軸心的反攻，但仔細觀察時，其步調亦未必一致。關於亡命倫敦的各國傀儡政權，及第二戰綫問題，英美蘇之閒的鴻溝，不僅暴露於政治見解的對立與矛盾，即從此次奎貝克之會，蘇聯無代表出席，可見對立化的深刻。</p>
<p>此外，更就戰略上說，義大利戰綫與東部戰綫不僅沒有密切的聯繫，却往往含有政治的意圖而丸相牽制。但是從全體歐洲戰局而言，這二個戰綫在結果上，則有着直接重大的關聯的，所以今後義大利戰局的發展，對最近東部戰錢的推移，頗有重大的影響。</p>
<p>東部戰綫的中立區域，首先成爲今夏德蘇戰綫的主要戰塲，旋即延及全綫，這中部區域的奧萊爾，貝爾格勒特二地，在德蘇二軍的陣錢中，互爲突出部份而形成彎曲形。德蘇二軍今夏在這彎曲部份業已激戰一月，而最堪注意奢，即德軍已突然有計劃的撤退輿萊爾，反軸心機關及一般人指此爲蘇聯攻勢的表示，甚至說德軍遭遇了嚴重的局面。</p>
<p>吾人不問此次的撤退是不是有計劃的，總之，德國是根據重大的決定而實行的，唯以此即斷定德軍的頹勢，尙嫌過早。吾人以爲德軍的此項決定，乃在建立有利戰錢，儘量避免戰力的消耗，以增加戰爭的餘力。所以與其說是蘇聯呼應英美的舉動所致，母寗說是德國自動的撤退突出部分，避免犧牲，拉直戰綫，而使自己站於有利的立塲。這事實說明德蘇當前的軍事目標，是極不相同的。</p>
<p>可是，蘇聯尙乘勢疾進，以收復斯摩倫斯克，勃里安斯克，卡科夫爲目標，而南方的第二戰錢，歐洲各地的被炸亦日見激烈。德國如能迅速縮短東部戰綫，轉取有利的防禦陣綫，而善用這一部份騰出的餘力，則在其他戰錢上的德國地位，未必不能更轉於有利的形勢。（翔：譯自八月十四日東京朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>日海軍機大編隊　連續轟炸比洛亞　襲可倫班加拉敵被擊退</h3>
<p>東京二十三日中央社電　據南太平洋日軍某基地二十三日電，日海軍機隊於二十一日晨以戰鬥轟炸機聚合編隊，猛炸卑爾拉卑拉鳥之比洛亞美軍陣地。是日日轟炸機隊於上下午兩度空襲敵軍陣地時，曾與敵機空戰，並轟炸敵運輪船團，當擊沉敵大小型運輸船各一艘，另有敵大型運輪船二艘及中型運輪船一艘中彈受重創，發生大火。此外共擊落敵戰鬥機十四架。（又電）據南太平洋方而日軍某基地電，美軍爲圖反攻，又於二十二日晨以登陸用舟艇，魚需艇約十五艘，企圖在可倫班加拉島登陸，日陸上都隊當即與其交戰，擊沉敵船舶二艘，敵軍見勢不佳，即行遁走。（又電）南太平洋日軍某基地二十三日電，二十一日下午有美戰鬥機六架，來龔亞拉佛拉海阿盧羣島之邁哥爾。又該處日軍地上部隊當即開砲猛轟，同時日海軍機隊亦升空迫擊，旋即擊落敵機四架，另二架亦受創遁走。</p>

<h3>文學家代表昨晨抵東京</h3>
<p>東京二十三日中央社電　中滿蒙台灣及朝鮮文學家代表一行四十名，二十三日農抵東家，旋由久米正雄氏引導，首先參拜明治神宮及靖國神社，　即臨時變更預定參拜本塲區湯島孔子廟，我國代表徐白林氏發表談話謂：不日參拜靖國神社，該神社乃祭祀建設大東亞戰士之英靈者，觀後令人感慨無量，吾等文化戰士，亦應繼其遺志，努力奮鬥。</p>
<h3>南太平洋戰况激烈　美國自認苦戰</h3>
<p>繼倫特巴島之後繼續在新喬治亞鳥登陸的美軍，因日軍精銳的奮勇抗戰，而阻止其攻勢，歷時業已四卞餘日，在這期間，美軍雖動員優勢的陸海空軍兵力，反復攻擊，迄無顯著的戰果，西南太平洋反軸心軍司今部發言人叙述美軍苦戰的狀况稱：「美軍步兵部隊與日軍作猛烈戰鬥，日軍守備隊雖受海陸空三方面的猛烈攻擊，但士氣義無沮喪的模樣。抵抗日見熾烈。」八月九日的美國泰晤士週報，報告新喬治亞鳥美軍苦戰的狀况稱：</p>
<p>「戰鬥的進行極爲遲緩，毫翻希望。何以不　呢？其理田從下述事實中可獲若干說明，美軍因在海空方面持有壓倒的優勢，故陸上部隊的指揮官希望用盲目的轟炸及砲隊替步兵打開不流血的進攻道路。這期待終成夢想，日本軍握就許多能耐受轟炸的地穴，這地穴是利用炸彈所穿裂的火口，造成恒久的洞穴及土堆，避難壕等。美軍如欲動手，不能不先澈底的設法消滅，日軍勇敢地深入潛留於美軍陣地，是以美軍陣地中時有銀　兵出現，與美軍交戰，這是前所未見的。這收狙擊兵的射繫非常正確，因此，死傷者甚多。即使是訓練有素的部隊，亦常不勝其擾。氣候不慣，新部隊的士氣。因這種日本軍隊的攻擊，而疲於奔命。」（翔：譯自八月十四日西部每日新聞阿根廷京城電）</p>

<h3>蘇美英三國　關係微妙</h3>
<p>里斯本二十三日中央社電　據此間太日接獲華盛頓消息，蘇聯駐美新大使格洛米柯，在一般公衆中並無聲望，渠自一九三九年起，即任蘇駐美大使館參事。消息靈通方面亦認渠爲一能幹之外交家，但關於蘇聯之與西方國家合作，渠之名宇一向朱被道及。</p>
<p>莫斯科二十三日中央社電　蘇聯各報二十二日，均登載蘇聯更迭駐美大使事，蘇聯政府當局對此，則力謂雖更迭大使，英·美·蘇三國間之友好關係仍無何等變化，並表示目前第二戰錢雖尙未結成，蘇聯政府仍與美國維持友好關係。蘇聯各報則極力要求結成第二戰綫，對英·美態度已表不滿，今後四個月間之歐洲戰局以第二戰綫爲中心·英美·蘇三國間之關係，殊堪注目。</p>
<p>東京二十三日中央社電　據此問權威人士觀測稱：蘇聯政府前曾更迭駐英大使邁斯基，今復在奎貝克會談進行中更迭，駐美大使李維諾夫，此實表明蘇聯對英·美方面深刻之不滿。又英美方面對蘇聯尙與日本根據日蘇中立條約維持友好關係一點亦未釋然惟因鑒於反軸心陣營如失掉蘇聯即無團結作戰之可能，故決定於奎貝克會談告終後，即派遣英·美特使赴蘇，俾敦睦誼，但蘇聯以奎貝克會談爲契機，對英·美露骨之反感則頗值注目。</p>
<p>里斯本二十二日中央社電　據此間接華盛頓訊，美政界對蘇政府召囘駐美大使李維諾夫之消息，感到意外之打擊。華盛頓政界希望於此數日間國務院方面能有安定人心之發表，美人除欲獲悉蘇政府召囘李維諾夫之動機外，對其將來之出處問題更加感覺關心。此六十七歲　蘇聯外交家，其擔任蘇聯之外交委員長已有十年，於一九三九年突被免職免職之次月中，即被擴斥於共黨中央委員會會議之外，自德·蘇戰事發生，即擔任與英·美之折衝，旋被任爲駐美大使以至今日。</p>
<p>瑞典京城二十三日中央社電　據此間接獲倫敦消息，倫敦政界昨對蘇聯之召囘駐美大使李維諾天事，並無評論，英國廣播公司對此次重要之外交更迭，亦僅報吿其事實，而不加評論，僅謂此乃最近蘇聯之第二次更換其外交人員，其第一次顯係指召囘駐美大使邁斯基而言</p>
<p>協約陣營政治紛爭</p>
<p>柏林二十三日中央社電　海通社外交訪員者稱：柏林人士之觀感均謂，蘇聯之突然召囘李維諾夫，定必完全出於羅斯福·邱吉爾意料之外，使之不勝詫異，因此均拒不加以評論，尙須探索此舉之背景也。斯達林今復以巳成事實，迫使英·美接受，協約國陣營紛爭之內幕，由此可以想見一斑。但敵人政治上之紛爭，幷不足使德國政策發生任何後果，蓋協約國之內爭，決不致使羅斯福。邱吉爾·斯達林緩和其仇視國社主義之態度，而德國作戰到底之心亦不致改變。柏林政界人士則謂，李維諾夫之召囘，足以證明調義英·美·蘇·三國章之戰略，實屬不可能。斯達林且對羅斯福·邱吉爾之諾言亦不信以爲眞，蓋斯達林所需者乃切實之行動，非空洞之諾言，所謂開闢第二戰綫今在西西里戰役之後，尤使斯達林大失所望，英·美之虛與委蛇，實爲斯達林此次召囘李維諾夫之主因。</p>

<h3>大東亞决戰的眞相（二）</h3>
<p>— 栗原大佐</p>
<p>所羅門羣島血戰的特性</p>
<p>現代的戰爭具有大消耗戰的性質，最近兵器異常進步，敵人與我方之戰爭準備都高度精密化，同時戰爭的規模擴大，艦船，兵器，軍需品的消耗當然相當巨大。</p>
<p>試將稱爲近代的陸戰的典型之德蘇兩大陸軍國的戰爭考察一同，即可知道地們的消耗是如何巨大。根據今年六月十八日德軍當局發表的囘顧開戰二周年的聲明，過去兩年問紅軍的損失爲俘虜五百五卞萬人，戰車三萬六千輛，大砲五萬門，飛機二萬架以上，爲補充此巨大的消耗常然，補充問題成爲很重要的，就是消耗戰必然的成爲補充戰補　路綫的長短和難易，有左右戰局的影響。德蘇戰爭在過去二年間，一進一退，反反覆覆，其唯一原因是由於德蘇兩國補充路延長和縮短，影響兩軍戰鬥力的高低，這事實很可以表示補充對於消耗，和後方生產力的增強對於補充是如何重要的以上所購的德蘇戰是近代典型的陸戰，但是隔海洋作戰的補充戰包含若各種要素，最近英美軍的北非作戰，西西里的登陸作戰，和太平洋的攻防戰，均是擁有很長的海上給養路的一大消耗戰，因爲敵我的激戰不獨在第一綫的戰塲，就是在陣後的給養路的破壞戰亦是非常激烈，這種給養戰的勝敗，對於第一綫有很大的影響，是必然的趨勢。所以我們不得不確保這海上給養路，爲確保海上給養路，絕對需要大景的各趣船隻，又爲船隻安全航行，更要確保制海權，爲達到此目的，確保制空權尤爲緊要。</p>
<p>現在我國對於增加船腹問題，正在盡力而行，一是爲的增強生產戰的輪送力一是爲的使在給養戰可以進到有利的地步。又促使陸上輸送力突飛猛進，無非補救海上蝓送力，就是船腹的不足。又以國內食以騰出十萬噸的巨大船舶，用以向前綫補充兵器資材，乃爲不可忽視的數量。此數量能否輔充到第一綫，對戰局上是有很大的影響的。</p>
<p>對現戰局　國民的覺悟</p>
<p>目下在所羅門羣島，新幾內亞方面的美軍的反攻是很激烈的，美負傷就敗退，不能以些少的負傷便心慌意亂，應盡全力將繼續戰到把敵人打倒爲止。</p>
<p>這大力士日本的力，當然將前綫將兵的力包括在內，但此力爲一億國民之力的總和。諸君的態度，諸君每天的行動，便是大力士在　上將要把敵人打倒的大力士的作戰妾勢，作戰糧自給自足爲目標，而努力於食糧增產，是爲的想停止由海路運送食糧，由此騰出來的船隻用以補充更多的重要物資，和需要的兵器，彈藥等到前錢，是地的唯一理由，假定米五石相當於一噸，則於國內增產五十萬石的米，就可將的兵士氣也很旺蔡，不能輕視。但是本人早已預料敵人在這方面的反攻是能激烈化的於戰略上亦是在所必然，不足爲奇。現在以此方面爲中心的太平洋戰局，有如今日的兩個最大力士在台上相撲，雙方勢均力敵，不能以些少的決意。觀察現在的戰略形勢，我方已將大東亞的要地收於掌握，即是我方已經確立能在內綫作戰的有利地步，在此有利的形勢之下，擊破敵人並不困難，但是從緬印國境始經馬尼拉，爪哇，蘇門達臘，新幾內亞·所羅門·到北方的阿留申的很長的大東亞的外圍，敵人有隨處進攻前來的可能。須要充分警戒。敵人既然亦以天下的大力士自任全體國民不得有林毫的疏忽，不得過於樂觀。我們應營固戰備，任由敵人英美無論向大東亞外圍任何地點進攻。我們應該用力量就在這地方相與周旋，將其擊破，非祇如此，敵人的戰法是正在企岡用空襲，來轟襲大東亞的要地，再轟炸日本本土的重要產業地帶。港灣。鐵路幹綫等·用這樣的方法來阻碍後方生產的活動，擾亂國民的思想，因其如此，爲對付對方計，需要充分的施設和國民全體的覺悟，固不待言。</p>
<p>最近在歐洲戰綫，英美空軍大規模反覆轟炸德國本土的眾要生產地帶的漢堡，埃森，和義大利首都羅馬，對日本本土和大東亞要地正在戌視耽耽，伺機作大轟炸，以前也講過，近代戰是消耗戰，所以敵人，遇有好機會料其必用所有手段，企圖把後方生產機構加以破壞，使戰力沮喪。彼用飛機作大規模的奇襲攻率，乃彼方常用的手段，今後對於這點的警戒，不得有一瞬的疏忽。</p>
<p>其次空襲所應當重視的，是用潛水艇作海上給養路被壞作戰，艦於潛水艇戰的特硃性，把敵潛水艇全部捕獲殲滅，殆不可能。我方運韓船中，於完遂海上補充的重大任務時，有　特的，但是我方爲着完遂大東亞作戰上又爲着達成大東亞經濟建設上，確保大東亞的海上交通路的完全，以及確保　上補充路·爲絕對不可缺的要件。用舶船和飛機對敵潛水艇的警戒更要嚴密，更進一步，積極的增加船腹，無論如何要確保海上補充力，在補充配方面要絕對求其必勝，像以前所諸的我方所占的有利的戰略形勢更要進一步把牠加強，於他方而確保大東亞圈內的海上補充路使前錢將士的補充完全無缺，能充分推進前綫將兵的戰鬬就是最後勝利到底　我們的。現在是一　國民。蹶起的時候，於這樣必勝信念之下，一億國民眞是以一心一德，舉他們的總力，貢獻於戰爭，我方的勝利是豫有希望的。</p>
<p>美國以珍珠灣的戰敗爲轉機，把國內體制作全面的改組，到現在已經徵到十八歲的靑年，大學的學生，已在很早以前就源源出發前綫，手執槍桿，乘坐飛機活躍於戰塲。國情同我們不同，他們巳有十幾萬的女性軍人。英國已徵用到十六歲的靑年，這班靑年正在前綫作戰，就這點看諸君今天就應該奮然而起，和他們此較日本學生最近才開始志願到陸海軍去，不免有太遲之感。</p>
<p>我常以戰爭用拔河作譬喩，於拔河時，第一，作指導的旗手應要，合好拍子，在同一瞬間，向同一方向把旗揮動，其參加執纜的國民應要和這旗手，合好拍子，向同一方向，合力拉纜，如在此時，搖旗方法不統一，拉櫝的人有的不用力，或向反對方向拉纜，就絕對不能得到勝利，戰時體制正與之相同，在指導地位的旗手，判斷悄形，大家應合好拍子，指導國民，鞭撻國民，每個國民應服從他們的指導，用最大效率，發揮他的力量，把這力量集中到完遂戰爭上，其中不得有一人抱不平，或意懷不滿的。</p>
<p>美國稱這次戰爭係「爲生存的戰爭」，這次大戰爭係賭大和民族盛衰興亡，毫無通融的大戰爭係絕對不能敗的戰爭。。前的戰　逐漸嚴重起來，敵人因最近的反攻揚揚得意，料必更有舉動，我方更要發抓高度的國民總力，強化戰力，把不逞的敵人反攻企圖粉碎。（完）（靈：譯自八月十六日四部每日新聞）</p>

<p>關於敎職員消費合作社　本市敎育界嚴正表示　　蔣　同君建議創設本市敎職員消費合作社一事，頗爲各界所重視，教職員自身固然希望成爲事實，减輕生活負担。社會人士稍明義理者，也莫不衷示同情，促使實現。本報前曾表示願集各方意見，擇要發表，以期集思廣益，共同討論，茲由朱斯煌李權時等十五位敎授交到集體意見，亟爲披露如次，諸敎授本教育者立塲，發爲共鳴，自是深刻而嚴正尙幸各界注意。編者附識　　本月十九日蔣壽同君提出組織「上海市教職員消費合作社」後，先後已獲得各方而的贊助。我們本敎育者的立塲，領意貢獻下列各項意見！　　第一，創設永久性的上海市敎職員消費合作社以免除中間商人的剝削，那是絕對的需要，尤其是現在，一切物價的高下，都被操機在囤積投機的商人手裏，爲要减輕敎職員的負擔，安定激職員及其家屬的生活，合作社的組織非但必需，而且還是一種迫不及待的自衛工作。　　第二，正因為這是有關敎職員本身的自衞工作，所以我們的立塲必須是純正的，除了解決教職員的生活困難問題以外，再沒有其他的目的或副作用。即使是合作社自身應得的積金或利潤，也不容許存在，我們的口號是：「每一分錢都用在教職員的身上！」　　第三，社員（教職員）的入股，原定第人二百元，除了一百元向學校常局移借外，每一社員都得繳出一百元。這在小墨敎職員恐怕無力負擔，所以在小學敎職員方面，我們主張减半，而他們的權利應和大中學敎職員相向。　　第四，爲了節省合作一社的經營費，調査工作和分配手續可採用學校單位制。即由各學校當局進行調査，領取和分配的工作，合作社方面站在監視的地位。　　第五，要從速促成合分爲：　由報紙暫時劃出相當地位，作爲組織敎職員消費合作社的讀者信箱，由讀者提出意見，並提出相當地位，作為組織敎職員消費合作社的讀者信箱，由讀者提出意見，並提出籌備人選：　一星　後，發表規納以後的人選，由各校公決：　籌備會成立，即先交涉配給及採辦證簽發事宜；　配給或採辦如有希望，即辦理各校教職員登記及入股手續；　向社會人士呼籲募款；　開始採辦物資並實行配給。　　任重致遠的敎育事業是和民族生命國家前逾有着密切的關係。我們不敢自負工作的神聖，但亦不敢輕忽時代的任務。一切外來的人事援助固然非常感激，但是我們不敢輕易地接受，我們願意本自已的力量，由自動的組織來彌補我們生活的缺陷。我們相信全市的市民們一定能賦予最大的同情的。簽署者（以姓氏筆劃爲序）：朱斯煌　李權時　周德熙　季英怕　胡介峰　耿淡如　陳科美　陳松茂　陸兆基　孫繩曾　高懋勳　蔣載華　潘樂水　戴豈心　顧仲彝社會服務厚生公司舉辦助學金　額定初中五十名　　昨接　生公司來函云：「敝公司爲警應貴報助學運動，聊盡國民微忱，特於海產企業盈利下，提出若干，作爲「厚生助學金」。本年度擬先舉辦初中一年級學犢五十名，將來陸續遞增初中二三以及高中各級，詳情可函詢八仙橋國華銀行徐禎祥君轉。」　　上海女中本學期起，招收免費額中學部三十名，小學部二十名，於本月二十六日在校甄別試騐，應試者請至新大沽路四百五十一號該校面洽。　　佛敎醫院施診　　本市馬斯爾路一二三號佛光療養院，由佛敎同人，招資設立，爲全國　　獨一之佛敎醫院，中西醫師各科建有，收治內科·婦科·肺病·胃病·戒烟及情志抑　，神經哀弱等症，上午門診，施診給藥，如屬赤貧，得捐款人及慈善團體之保送，可以免費住院治療，熱心人士之捐助該院經費者，亦請逕送該院會計科。　　健康指導　　　肺病全生集中法肺病診療所，普及贈送肺病全生集一書，可向威海衛路五六三弄四號陸奎生醫室憑報面索，或附郵函索。　　指導精神健康漢口路二七一弄五號精神治療院健康顧問部，指導精神修養　病術生節法，精神健康顧部費每年一千元，　收入之半數助入申報助學金，額定二十名，九月十五日止。　　因　靜坐學社該社爲因是子賂竹莊先生所設立，傳授精神衛生方法，已辦過三期，第四期將於九月開始傳習，定額二十人，有志學習者，可至新沽路五百〇弄五十八號報名。　　居住證待領居住證三四三五二八號徐袁氏，塡發機關漢口警察局，遺失者請來　領。　　徵聘　周浦某中學，覆聘初中數理敎師一位，待遇　膳宿五百元以上，有　者請向左處接洽。　　　謝　范囘春君經募事僑楊先生，指助聯誼義務小學經常費一萬元，已交高琴英校長，謝謝。洋涇浜聖母院參觀記（四）　　施診施藥　施食施衣　　社會上最大的病象，是貧和病。洋徑浜聖母院就盡力於貧病的敎濟事業，施診，施藥，施食，施衣，　　聖母院的後面，貧民區的永安街一條小弄門口，掛着「仁善堂兒童施診所」的木牌，不時傳出一陣陣小孩的啼哭聲，這就是聖母院公敎進行會主辦的施診施藥事業之一，專治貧苦兒童。醫師有中醫王益三先生，西醫周渭良先生，都盡義務應診。每天診治者約有四五卞名。一向完全免費，現以藥費昻貴，每名酌收一元，但赤貧者仍可免交。　　天主敎仁善施診所，是洋涇浜聖母院施診施藥的首創事業，已有七十多年的歷史，現在附　於城內虹橋弄的仁善　　堂，中醫王益三先小即住宿該堂，經常應診。據潘姆姆說：去年實在成績，計門診四三·七四一號·給藥五一·〇四九號，出診八三五次，探望監犯施診給藥一〇·七一三號，探望仁濟育要嬰孩施軫給藥一四·六七五號，仁躋善堂施診給藥一六·八〇〇號，可見對社會的實際助益眞是不小。　　新閘路南大通路，在熱鬧的市街上，像什麼，飾一樣，有一家雙開間兩層樓的「天主敎仁慈施診所」：是早晨八點多鐘，已經擠滿了求診者，男·婦·老不幼·爛手壞脚，像是病患的展覽會一般店護士們正忙着照顧。負責該所事業的孫姆姆說，該所由洋涇浜聖母院創辦於十六年三月，第一位醫師是楊延年先生，完全免費施診給藥。今年七月才收號金一元·赤貧者仍可免交。現在有西醫吳寶源及周仁兩先生，義務診治。每週來所計爲三個半天，平常由三位護士及一個助手應付。每天門診少則一百五十人，多則二百人，此外，還經常去扛密公所及金司徒廟貧民區施診給藥，頗受貧民感戴。　　洋涇浜聖母院除了施診給藥事業之外，還盡力於施衣施食的救貧事業，在仁慈施診所，孫姆姆就打開樓上的儲藏櫃給記老看，裏面還有預備贈給貧病者的衣服，不過由於經費困竭，物價高漲，今符此種事業能否繼續，是一個絕大的疑問。施食方而，集中在聖母院大門，每天前往領取粥飯，麵包的，包含各國各地的無告者。常會排成幾十丈長的隊伍，消磨去一二小時之久。有幾個特別要面子的外國貧民，寗可遲領，不參加隊伍，還要等到十時以後。　　救濟和保護囚犯　　監獄制度的存在，本來是極不得已的事，獄中囚犯，尤其是女犯生活之痛苦，更爲善心人士所不忍目睹。何况，寃獄以及非刑，在現社會上特別是過去租界監獄，是極普遍的現象。爲了人權，爲了天理，爲了良心，雖曾有人努力過「究獄平反」，「人權保障」第運動，可惜都未見什麼成績。洋涇浜聖母院知在這幾年來，切實地苦幹着救濟和保護工作，全持其事的潘姆姆說：是在民國二十年十月，她們集合天主教女信徒，一般家庭婦女，大約五十餘人，在洋涇浜聖母院之下，成立「洋涇浜公敎進行會婦女部」，她們的主要工作之一，就是對各監獄女囚犯們施診給藥施食及敎化，先赴北浙江路新衙門」。後來更發展　北新涇監獄。爲前英法租界當局特請擔任獄中義務治療及敎誨感化工作。以後就由潘修道姆姆，並品教中熱心會友加入工作，每逢星期三六下午輸流到各大監獄探望獄犯，（共約三百餘名）。病者施以醫療，發給藥品。並鑒於囚犯衣食不足之苦·補給衣被食品，每月至少四次。同時對她們作精神敎育，餘傳道外，又敎以新知識。以禮輔刑，以敎啓蒙，意義尤爲重大。去年秋天，更應第一特區人犯出獄保護會的懇商，收容出獄後無家可歸的女犯，在城內肇嘉路租屋兩幢設立「仁善貧民工廠」，隊了出獄女犯之外，兼收貧苦無依的婦女，敎以普通謀生的技藝，經常留廠的有二十餘人，現在多數已代爲介紹職業，走上自力求生之路。剩下的併入虹橋弄仁善育嬰堂。這種救助囚犯的事業，頗得社會人士的讚美，認爲足以補救刑罰之偏弊。去年有一個曾爲某著名實業社職工的盜犯，於臨刑之前，要求五分鐘的常衆發言，他承認盜殺處死是應該，但他說：盜匪之成因，由於白己無知錯誤者七分，而社會政治至少要擔負三分責任，如果人人衣食滿足，決不自甘犯罪，對於罪犯，如能禁止虐待與殺戮，加以敎化，一樣可以走上自新之路，變爲社會國家有用之人，他這臨終吁聲，着實感動了法官和一般市民，因此，近來已有出獄入保護會的組織，由各敎　敎徒及社會熱心人士協力進行，聖母院的修女自是最努力的一員。華北急賑捐款徵信錄（第卅七）　　馮共灑湘王在田劉起戈中武奮洪炳姚勤張冷陸　鳳彥錢時清袁且魯張桂生萬益鑫盛維新王祖英劉信旃樋口辰次郎有住甲子郎內田潤平紅松一雄周憲武夏尙信黃延德何兆　孫學增張經　馮紹基程賽笙吳鴻志常福元吳景祥孫葆華羅繼永莊士俊陳善頣以上三十六戶各五十元陳有仕楊建業盧安卿余坤躁薛檡錄陳昭坦戴乃溶王海山卿愛柃張志廣姚德元彭偑紳孫克明余常安劉同　王榮達黃明德石家陳何勞李鳳笙董承康鄺文　高七來王福日李文臣陳東　李光祚陳書　　上二十八戶各五十元中央統計股九十元謝穆翔舒四十元張國英朱雅麗胡文珍孫克貞孫克新孫克賢方家駨彭清愷裘愉柏陳裕安朱明中以上十一戶各卅元連和馮國華王裕祁朱元麟姚德元李宣　范仲雅何志達譚　孚王信孚謝世棟包世芳鍾誠锠戴家驥朱福保唐根發經佛如會少雄陳　祥陳道濟楊心如忻禮　棄　模　昌湘程來遠以上廿五　　卅元　重　蕭鍾祥佘明祥高宗祜合一百　高來標朱理　張　倫方祖　黃立身張雲塘李星南張　哉曾勱剛孫沛王陽陳之锜劉連　以上十三戶各廿元陸楚　何愛珠姚　華　全仲朱亮亞賈孫　尙世濟黃丙炎張思蔭吳泰來姚德元鍾忠德胡煜琳丁文波余保民高文斌張安德方賢越鄭人煜鮑忠德陳心雄武光漢吳鴻達郭善揚吳彥臣林慕蓀尤祥瀾沈貽瑤王維善以上二十九戶各二十元李敏貞李景芝毛寶康葉兆豐合捐六十元方錫豐謝一　徐家梅顧星階以上四戶各十五元盧偑文吳熙吳則　姚霈蔣宗德陳宗　胡少雲謝明德胡炳林以上九戶各十元　志新杜偑　各十元伍葆初經募韓肇連雷良洪乾　葉湛銘何綺川李宗明陶樂均　亮聲孟日晋李可任李長哲陳震雷沈　祺張遠　劉恩彤梁保廉關蘭雪衛祥　袁富士康信沈泰峻盛載榕沈漢英楊習榕伍崇　吳裕鵬胡樹人顧開弟黃賢王春元　雲　程康侯　芝卿陳　藩朱壽彭楊鴻光葛益華沈觀暾張國棟楊權人姚　元張鳳生孫克勤劉總生步履中蔣家保吳國萃合捐柏庭孫用震合捐歸重遠宋玉麟合捐程灝柯　恩池合捐唐玉山沈　　合捐鮑惠義宮　垣合捐張洪度劉曾達合捐以上五十一戶各一百元（合計五千一百元）</p>

<h3>The Pressing Problem of Food Supply</h3>
<p>Since the government announced the order to purchase cotton yarn and cotton cloth, although a small number of commodity prices have fallen, the price of rice and grain, which is most important to people's livelihood, has not fallen. We can assert that if the price of rice and grain can also fall, then commodity prices in general will definitely be able to fall across the board. According to past experience, the rise in various commodity prices and their speed are extremely abnormal, sometimes rising with rice prices as the center, while other times falling simultaneously regardless of rice prices. However, it is undeniable that fluctuations in rice prices have a major impact on other commodity prices.</p>
<p>However, today, if we abandon theoretical economic explanations and analyze purely based on facts, we can prove that the prices of "food"—that is, rice—and "clothing"—that is, yarn and cloth—two major daily necessities for people's livelihood, are the centers of all commodity prices, but each exerts a major effect. If the prices of "food" and "clothing" rise or fall in unison, then the rise and fall of all commodity prices will also be fully consistent. If the prices of "food" and "clothing" rise or fall inconsistently, then the rise and fall of all commodity prices will also be inconsistent. For example, in the past, rice prices fell back, but yarn and cloth did not, so some commodity prices fell accordingly, while others did not, which resulted in the passive rebound of rice prices. Now that yarn and cloth have fallen back, but rice prices have not, some commodity prices are falling, while others are not. If we now hope that all commodity prices will fall across the board, we must first promote a drop in rice prices so that it is consistent with the drop in yarn and cloth prices.</p>
<p>If our above analysis does not contradict the facts, then, to demand a comprehensive drop in commodity prices, we cannot but first demand a drop in rice prices. We must first ask: Why did rice prices rise nearly twofold at the turn of June and July? Why is household rice being reduced and postponed? Regarding the latter, although there was a report from the Datong News Agency yesterday, the person in charge cannot shirk their responsibility for the reasons conveyed. If these two problems cannot be resolved, it will cause great disappointment to the people, and they will wonder: To what extent will the prices rise? How long will the postponement last? How much will it be reduced?</p>
<p>The general speculation is that the reasons for this are: transportation obstruction, preventing smooth delivery; insufficient rice and grain production; and mismanagement, inadequate handling, the so-called "human error." To remedy these three shortcomings, we believe:</p>
<p>In terms of transportation, we should ask our ally Japan for as much assistance as possible. We hope that our Japanese friends, with a long-term vision of Sino-Japanese cooperation, will absolutely value the Chinese people's food problem. An ancient Chinese sage said, "The people regard food as their heaven," which shows that the importance of food to the people is unparalleled. The competent grain authorities should have complete management and command rights over the transportation of rice flour for the supply of people's food.</p>
<p>Insufficient grain production is naturally the root cause. Increasing food production has long been established as a national policy. The relevant competent authorities only need to formulate an overall plan and implement it as soon as possible. We should all first make use of wasteland, open spaces, and gaps to plant as much rice, wheat, and miscellaneous grains as possible to make up for the deficiency.</p>
<p>If there is mismanagement, then we advocate adjusting the organization as soon as possible, recognizing the absolute importance of the people's food problem, and not passively delaying and making mistakes. Moreover, the National Federation of Commerce Associations is the only economic regulatory agency with commercial autonomy, so managing food regulation seems to be its inherent responsibility. Since the current rice management agencies have not been able to handle matters perfectly, it is natural to merge them into the Federation of Commerce Associations to take over and take sole responsibility. Or the Federation of Commerce Associations should select impartial people from society to preside over the handling. We must ensure that the people's food problem is resolved reasonably.</p>
<p>The provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, especially the area near Shanghai, are abundant rice-producing regions. If the regulation of rice and grain in this area is at a loss, then the future of the people's food supply is uncertain, and runaway inflation and social unrest are lurking here, which is really too dangerous. After supporting the government's policy of purchasing yarn and cloth, we must urge the government to attach importance to the people's food supply, promptly determine food policies, strengthen regulatory agencies, and improve procurement and distribution methods. Adjusting the people's food supply and stabilizing the people's livelihood truly depend on this!</p>
<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Trends in the Eastern Front War</h3>
<p>The advancement of the Eastern Front has become tense with the aggravation of the Italian war situation. Therefore, the Eastern Front is closely related to the overall European war situation. Although Britain and the United States in Italy and the Soviet Union on the Eastern Front have each launched counteroffensives against the Axis powers, careful observation reveals that their pace may not be consistent. Regarding the puppet regimes of various countries exiled in London and the Second Front issue, the divide between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union is not only exposed in the opposition and contradictions of political opinions, but also in the depth of the opposition, as evidenced by the absence of Soviet representatives at the Quebec Conference.</p>
<p>In addition, strategically speaking, the Italian Front and the Eastern Front not only lack close ties but often contain political intentions and restrain each other. However, from the perspective of the overall European war situation, these two fronts ultimately have direct and significant connections. Therefore, the future development of the Italian war situation will have a significant impact on the recent progress of the Eastern Front.</p>
<p>The central region of the Eastern Front first became the main battlefield of the German-Soviet front this summer, and then extended to the entire front. In this central region, Orel and Belgorod mutually form prominent and curved shapes within the lines of the German and Soviet armies. The German and Soviet armies have been fighting fiercely in this curved area for a month this summer, and what is most noteworthy is that the German army has suddenly withdrawn from Orel in a planned manner. Anti-Axis institutions and the general public have pointed to this as an indication of the Soviet offensive, even saying that the German army has encountered a serious situation.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether this withdrawal is planned, Germany has implemented it based on a major decision. However, it is too early to determine the decline of the German army based solely on this. We believe that this decision by the German army is to establish a favorable front, minimize the consumption of combat power, and increase the surplus of war power. Therefore, rather than saying that it is the result of the Soviet Union responding to the actions of Britain and the United States, it is more accurate to say that Germany is voluntarily withdrawing from the protruding parts, avoiding sacrifices, straightening the front line, and putting itself in a favorable position. This fact shows that the current military goals of Germany and the Soviet Union are extremely different.</p>
<p>However, the Soviet Union is still taking advantage of the momentum to advance rapidly, aiming to recover Smolensk, Bryansk, and Kharkov, and the Second Front in the south and the bombing of various parts of Europe are also becoming increasingly intense. If Germany can quickly shorten the Eastern Front, adopt a favorable defensive line, and make good use of the surplus power freed up, then Germany's position on other fronts may not be able to shift to a more favorable situation.

<h3>Large Formation of Japanese Naval Aircraft Continuously Bombs Biola, Attacks on Kolombangara Repelled</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) – According to a report from a Japanese naval base in the South Pacific on the 23rd, a formation of Japanese naval aircraft, consisting of fighter-bombers, launched a heavy bombing raid on the American positions at Biola, Biola Island on the morning of the 21st. On the same day, the Japanese bomber squadron engaged enemy aircraft in aerial combat during two air raids on enemy positions in the morning and afternoon. They also bombed enemy transport ship convoys, sinking one large and one small enemy transport ship. In addition, two large and one medium-sized enemy transport ships were hit and severely damaged, causing major fires. A total of fourteen enemy fighter planes were shot down. (Another dispatch) According to a report from a Japanese base in the South Pacific, in an attempt to counterattack, American forces used approximately fifteen landing craft and torpedo boats to attempt a landing on Kolombangara Island on the morning of the 22nd. Japanese ground forces immediately engaged them, sinking two enemy ships. Seeing the unfavorable situation, the enemy forces fled. (Another dispatch) According to a report from a Japanese base in the South Pacific on the 23rd, six American fighter planes attacked Maikol in the Arawe Islands of the Yalafura Sea on the afternoon of the 21st. The Japanese ground forces stationed there immediately opened fire, and the Japanese naval air force also scrambled to intercept them, quickly shooting down four enemy planes, with the remaining two damaged and fleeing.</p>

I am well aware that your country's citizens are determined to persevere in our common war until the final victory is won, which is truly a cause for celebration for the future of Greater East Asia. The signing of this treaty is a manifestation of the traditional friendship between our two countries for three thousand years.

<h3>Japanese Aircraft Attack Guilin, Shoot Down Five American Planes</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 23rd (Central News Agency) – When a Japanese army aviation unit attacked Guilin, the forward base of the American air force stationed in Chongqing, on the 20th, it shot down five American planes. According to a dispatch from a Associated Press reporter in Chongqing, the American military headquarters in Chongqing announced on the 22nd, also admitting the fact that the Japanese air force attacked Guilin, but deliberately reduced the damage it suffered, claiming that only two American planes were shot down in the aerial combat.</p>
<h3>Delegation of Literary Figures Arrives in Tokyo Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) – A delegation of forty literary figures from China, Manchuria, Taiwan, and Korea arrived in Tokyo this morning.

Mr. Bailin Xu, the representative of our country, said in a statement: "I will visit the Yasukuni Shrine in the near future. The shrine enshrines the heroic spirits of the soldiers who built Greater East Asia. It fills people with emotion after seeing it. We cultural warriors should also continue their legacy and strive hard."</p>
<h3>Intense Fighting in the South Pacific, America Admits to Hardship</h3>
<p>Following the landing on Rendova Island, the American forces continued to land on New Georgia Island, and their offensive has been hindered by the valiant resistance of the elite Japanese forces for over forty days. During this period, the American forces have mobilized superior land, sea, and air forces to repeatedly attack, but have not achieved significant results. A spokesperson for the anti-Axis forces in the Southwest Pacific described the hardship of the American forces: "American infantry units are engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese forces. The Japanese garrison, although subjected to intense attacks from the sea, land, and air, does not appear to be demoralized. The resistance is becoming increasingly fierce." The August 9th issue of the American Times Weekly reported on the hardship of the American forces on New Georgia Island:</p>
<p>"The battle is progressing extremely slowly, with no hope. Why is this the case? The reason can be found in the following facts: Because the American forces hold overwhelming superiority in the sea and air, the commanders of the ground units hope to use indiscriminate bombing and artillery fire to open a bloodless path for the infantry to advance. This expectation has become a dream. The Japanese army occupies many underground holes that can withstand bombing. These holes are created using the craters left by bombs to form permanent caves and earth mounds, shelters, etc. If the American forces want to take action, they must first thoroughly eliminate these positions. The Japanese bravely infiltrate and remain in the American positions, so snipers appear in the American positions from time to time and engage the American forces. This has never been seen before. The shooting accuracy of these snipers is very high, so there are many casualties. Even well-trained units are often overwhelmed. The unfamiliar climate and the morale of the new units are exhausted by these attacks by the Japanese army."

<h3>German Forces Withdraw from Kharkov According to Plan</h3>
<p>Military Facilities Completely Destroyed</p>
<p>Heavy Fighting Still Underway Northwest of Kharkov</p>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) – The German High Command announced on the 23rd that German forces completely destroyed the military facilities in the city of Kharkov on the night of the 22nd and withdrew from the city according to plan without being hindered by Soviet forces. Kharkov has lost its value as a transportation center as it has been repeatedly seized by German and Soviet forces during past battles. After the German forces withdrew from Kharkov, the front line has been shortened, so it can exert its effect more fully.</p>
<p>Kharkov has now changed hands for the fourth time in less than two years. The city fell into German hands four months after the start of the Eastern Front war in 1941. The German forces occupied the city for six months, and then it was recaptured by Soviet forces in February of this year, only to be reoccupied by German forces a month later. Now it has once again fallen into Soviet hands.</p>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) – The German military headquarters reported today that the German special tank division is currently clearing out an encircled enemy force northwest of Kharkov. The number of enemy prisoners and German war spoils is also increasing sharply. Although the Soviet forces are reinforcing other war zones on the Eastern Front, they have all been repelled. Yesterday, the Soviet forces lost a total of 409 tanks and 73 aircraft.</p>

<h3>Subtle Relationships Among the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a Washington dispatch received here, the new Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Gromyko, does not have a strong reputation among the general public. He has served as a counselor at the Soviet Embassy in the United States since 1939. Informed sources also consider him a capable diplomat, but his name has rarely been mentioned in connection with Soviet cooperation with Western countries.</p>
<p>Moscow, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – On the 22nd, all Soviet newspapers published the news of the Soviet Union's replacement of its ambassador to the United States. The Soviet government authorities strongly stated that although the ambassador has been replaced, the friendly relations between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union will not undergo any changes. They also expressed that even though the Second Front has not yet been formed, the Soviet government will maintain friendly relations with the United States. However, Soviet newspapers are strongly demanding the formation of the Second Front and have expressed dissatisfaction with the attitudes of Britain and the United States. The European war situation in the next four months will be centered on the Second Front, and the relationship between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union deserves close attention.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to observations by authoritative sources here: The Soviet government previously replaced its ambassador to Britain, Maisky, and now, during the Quebec Conference, it has replaced its ambassador to the United States, Litvinov. This clearly indicates the Soviet Union's deep dissatisfaction with Britain and the United States. Furthermore, Britain and the United States have not been reassured by the fact that the Soviet Union maintains friendly relations with Japan based on the Japanese-Soviet Neutrality Pact. However, in view of the fact that losing the Soviet Union would make unified operations impossible for the anti-Axis alliance, they have decided to dispatch special envoys from Britain and the United States to the Soviet Union after the conclusion of the Quebec Conference in order to strengthen friendly relations. However, the Soviet Union's undisguised antipathy towards Britain and the United States, taking the Quebec Conference as an opportunity, is quite noteworthy.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a Washington dispatch received here, the American political circles were unexpectedly shocked by the news of the Soviet government's recall of its ambassador to the United States, Litvinov. Washington political circles hope that the State Department will make a statement within the next few days to reassure people. In addition to wanting to know the Soviet government's motives for recalling Litvinov, Americans are even more concerned about his future whereabouts. This 67-year-old Soviet diplomat served as the Soviet Union's Foreign Minister for ten years. In 1939, he was suddenly dismissed from his post. The following month, he was expelled from the Central Committee meeting of the Communist Party. After the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, he was responsible for negotiations with Britain and the United States and was subsequently appointed as the ambassador to the United States until today.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a London dispatch received here, London political circles made no comment yesterday on the Soviet Union's recall of its ambassador to the United States, Litvinov. The British Broadcasting Corporation only reported the facts of this important diplomatic change without adding any commentary, simply stating that this was the Soviet Union's second recent change of its diplomatic personnel. The first, obviously, refers to the recall of Ambassador Maisky to Britain.</p>
<p>Political Disputes Within the Allied Camp</p>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – A Hague News Agency diplomatic correspondent stated that Berliners generally believe that the Soviet Union's sudden recall of Litvinov must have been completely unexpected by Roosevelt and Churchill, causing them considerable surprise. Therefore, they are refusing to comment and are still exploring the background to this move. Stalin is now forcing Britain and the United States to accept what has already become a reality. One can imagine the internal strife within the Allied camp. However, the political disputes of the enemy are not enough to cause any consequences for German policy, because the internal struggles of the Allies will never cause Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin to ease their hostility towards National Socialism, and Germany's determination to fight to the end will not change. Berlin political figures say that the recall of Litvinov is sufficient proof that the strategic coordination among Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union is impossible. Stalin also does not believe in the promises of Roosevelt and Churchill, taking them to be true, because what Stalin needs is concrete action, not empty promises. The so-called opening of the Second Front, especially after the Sicilian campaign, has greatly disappointed Stalin. The prevarication of Britain and the United States is the main reason for Stalin's recall of Litvinov this time.</p>
<h3>Swedish Foreign Minister Declares Determination to Resist Aggression and Vigorously Maintain Absolute Neutrality</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – Foreign Minister Guenther, in a speech in Karlskrona on Sunday, reiterated Sweden's determination to maintain peace and absolute neutrality. He vigorously asserted that the Swedish nation is determined to resist any aggression. He stated: "Whoever attacks us or seeks to drive our country into war is our enemy." The Foreign Minister also discussed the dangers of Sweden becoming isolated by not participating in the war, but he stated that this danger can be overcome by Sweden's sincerity and efforts to build a peaceful world. Finally, the Foreign Minister vigorously asserted that the future peace must be a fair and far-reaching peace, which is extremely important for Sweden.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a report submitted by the Executive Yuan based on a report from the Ministry of Education, Mr. Li Xiaoshi, the chairman of the board of directors of the Shanghai Private Nianci Free Primary School, has donated a total of 204,000 yuan for the school's operating expenses, and a factual statement has been prepared, specially forwarded for review and an order of commendation. Li Xiaoshi's donation of a large sum of money and his enthusiasm for promoting education are commendable and should be commended to inspire others. This is hereby ordered.</p>
<h3>The Truth About the Greater East Asia Decisive Battle (2)</h3>
<p>— Colonel Kurihara</p>
<p>Characteristics of the Bloody Battle in the Solomon Islands</p>
<p>Modern warfare has the nature of a war of attrition. Recently, weapons have advanced remarkably, and the war preparations of both the enemy and our side have become highly sophisticated. At the same time, the scale of the war has expanded, and the consumption of ships, weapons, and military supplies is naturally considerable.</p>
<p>If we examine the war between the two major land powers of Germany and the Soviet Union, which is considered a typical modern land war, we can see how enormous their consumption is. According to the statement issued by the German authorities on June 18 this year, reviewing the second anniversary of the start of the war, the Red Army's losses in the past two years were 5.55 million prisoners, 36,000 tanks, 50,000 artillery pieces, and over 20,000 aircraft. Naturally, the issue of replenishment to compensate for this enormous consumption has become very important. That is, a war of attrition inevitably becomes a war of replenishment. The length and difficulty of the supply route have an impact on the war situation. The fact that the German-Soviet war has advanced and retreated repeatedly in the past two years is due solely to the lengthening and shortening of the supply routes of Germany and the Soviet Union, which affects the strength of the two armies. This fact can very well indicate how important replenishment is for consumption and how important the strengthening of rear production capacity is for replenishment. The above-mentioned German-Soviet war is a typical modern land war, but a war of replenishment conducted across the ocean contains various elements. Recently, the British and American forces' North African campaign, the landing operation in Sicily, and the Pacific offensive and defensive war are all major wars of attrition with very long maritime supply routes. Because the fierce battles between the enemy and our side are not only on the front lines but also very fierce in the destruction of supply routes behind the lines, the victory or defeat of this supply war has a great impact on the front lines, which is an inevitable trend. Therefore, we must ensure this maritime supply route. To ensure the maritime supply route, a large number of various types of ships are absolutely necessary. Furthermore, for the safe navigation of ships, it is even more necessary to secure sea control, and to achieve this goal, it is crucial to secure air superiority.</p>
<p>Currently, our country is making every effort to increase the number of ships. One is to enhance the transport capacity for production and war, and the other is to advance the war of replenishment to a favorable position. Furthermore, the rapid advancement of land transport capacity is nothing more than to remedy the inadequacy of maritime transport capacity, which is the lack of ships. Furthermore, by providing food domestically, it is possible to free up huge ships with a tonnage of 100,000 tons to replenish weapons and materials to the front lines, which is a quantity that cannot be ignored. Whether this quantity can be replenished to the front lines has a great impact on the war situation.</p>
<p>National Awareness of the Current War Situation</p>
<p>At present, the American counterattacks in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea are very fierce. The American soldiers are defeated when they are wounded, and they cannot be flustered by minor injuries. They should do everything possible to continue fighting until they defeat the enemy.</p>
<p>This great power of Japan certainly includes the strength of the soldiers on the front lines, but this power is the sum of the strength of 100 million people. Your attitude, your daily actions, are the posture of the great power that is about to defeat the enemy on the stage. Striving for self-sufficiency in war food and working hard to increase food production is to stop transporting food by sea, thereby freeing up ships to replenish more important materials and necessary weapons and ammunition to the front lines. This is the only reason. Assuming that five koku of rice is equivalent to one ton, then increasing domestic rice production by 500,000 koku will also boost the morale of the soldiers, which cannot be underestimated. However, I had already anticipated that the enemy's counterattacks in this area would be fiercer, which is inevitable in strategic terms and not surprising. The current Pacific war situation centered on this area is like two of the greatest strongmen wrestling on the stage today. Both sides are evenly matched, and they cannot be careless with even slight determination. Observing the current strategic situation, our side has taken control of the key areas of Greater East Asia, which means that our side has established a favorable position for fighting on the inner lines. Under this favorable situation, defeating the enemy is not difficult. However, from the Burmese-Indian border to Manila, Java, Sumatra, New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and the Aleutians in the north, the enemy has the possibility of attacking from anywhere along the very long periphery of Greater East Asia. Full vigilance is required. Since the enemy also regards itself as the greatest strongman in the world, the entire nation must not be negligent in the slightest and must not be overly optimistic. We should strengthen our war preparations and allow the enemy, whether it is Britain or the United States, to attack any location on the periphery of Greater East Asia. We should use our strength to engage them in that area and defeat them. Not only that, the enemy's strategy is to attempt to use air raids to bomb the key areas of Greater East Asia and then bomb the important industrial zones, ports, and railway trunk lines of the Japanese mainland, using this method to hinder rear production activities and disrupt the thinking of the people. Because of this, it goes without saying that full facilities and the overall awareness of the people are needed to deal with the other side.</p>
<p>Recently, on the European front, the British and American air forces have repeatedly bombed the important production areas of Hamburg, Essen, and the Italian capital Rome on a large scale. They are watching the Japanese mainland and the key areas of Greater East Asia, waiting for an opportunity to carry out large-scale bombings. As I have said before, modern war is a war of attrition, so the enemy will seize any good opportunity and use all means to destroy the rear production structure and depress our war capacity. Using aircraft for large-scale surprise attacks is a common means used by the other side, and vigilance against this point must not be relaxed for a moment in the future.</p>
<p>Secondly, what should be emphasized regarding air raids is the use of submarines to disrupt maritime supply routes. Due to the special nature of submarine warfare, it is almost impossible to capture and annihilate all enemy submarines. Among the ships that our side transports, there are those that are particularly important in completing the important task of maritime replenishment. However, in order for our side to complete the Greater East Asia war and to achieve the economic construction of Greater East Asia, it is absolutely indispensable to ensure the complete maritime traffic routes of Greater East Asia and to ensure the replenishment routes above. Vigilance against enemy submarines must be stricter with ships and aircraft, and further increase the number of ships. No matter what, we must ensure maritime replenishment capacity, and we must absolutely seek victory in terms of replenishment and deployment. As I have said before, we must further strengthen the favorable strategic position that our side occupies, and ensure the maritime supply routes within the Greater East Asia sphere, so that the replenishment of the front-line soldiers is completely flawless, and that they can fully advance the war of the front-line soldiers, which is our ultimate victory. Now is the time for the entire nation to rise up. With such an unwavering belief in victory, 100 million people will unite as one and contribute their total strength to the war. Our victory is expected.</p>
<p>The United States, taking the defeat at Pearl Harbor as a turning point, has comprehensively reorganized its domestic system. So far, it has drafted young people as young as 18, and university students have been sent to the front lines long ago, holding guns and flying airplanes, active on the battlefield. The national conditions are different from ours. They already have over 100,000 female soldiers. Britain has drafted young people as young as 16, and these young people are fighting on the front lines. From this point of view, you should rise up today and compare yourselves with them. Japanese students have only recently begun to volunteer for the army and navy, which seems a bit too late.</p>
<p>I often use tug-of-war as a metaphor for war. During tug-of-war, first, the flagman who gives the instructions must coordinate the beat and wave the flag in the same direction at the same moment. The people participating in holding the rope must coordinate with the flagman, pull the rope in the same direction with all their strength. If, at this time, the method of waving the flag is not unified, and some of the people pulling the rope do not use their strength, or pull the rope in the opposite direction, then victory can never be achieved. The wartime system is the same. The flagman in the guiding position assesses the situation, and everyone should coordinate the beat, guide the people, spur on the people, and each person should obey their guidance, use the maximum efficiency, and exert their strength, and concentrate this strength on completing the war. Among them, no one should hold grievances or harbor discontent.</p>
<p>The United States calls this war "a war for survival." This great war is a gamble on the rise and fall of the Yamato race, a great war of no compromise, a war that cannot be lost absolutely. The fronts are gradually becoming more serious. The enemy is elated by the recent counterattacks and will surely take further action. Our side must further exert a high degree of national strength, strengthen our war capacity, and smash the enemy's attempt to counterattack.

<p>Mayor's Banquet</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Shanghai dispatch: Yesterday at 7:00 PM, Mayor Chen hosted a banquet at the International Hotel to fete Minister Aoki and his entourage, including Director-General Takeuchi, Counselor Imai, Reporting Secretary, and Secretary Agosunago. Those invited to accompany them included 32 Japanese figures such as Lieutenant General Nagatsu, Lieutenant General Kinoshita, Minister Tajiri, Major General Kondo, Major General Kinoshita, Consul General Yano, Counselor Okazaki, Counselor Wataru, and Advisor Funatsu.

During the banquet, Mayor Chen gave a speech, stating: "Your Excellency Minister Aoki, distinguished guests, today, after Shanghai recovered the two concessions in August, Minister Aoki, who is in charge of the new policy, has graced Shanghai with his presence, which makes me and the people of Shanghai very grateful and excited. Recalling when Minister Aoki was hired as an economic advisor to the National Government, he solved many problems and achieved many successes, his achievements are remarkable and people miss him very much. Later, he became the first Minister of the Greater East Asia Ministry, and he made many plans for the independence and freedom of the various ethnic groups in Greater East Asia, which is not only fortunate for China, but also fortunate for all the ethnic groups in Asia. Recently, China's finances have tended to stabilize, and the economy has regained its vitality, thanks to Minister Aoki's greatest efforts. In the future, we, both Chinese and Japanese, officials and civilians, will cooperate sincerely and exhaustively to enrich the content of the new policy and stabilize the steps of the new policy, not allowing difficulties to discourage our will, and not allowing obstacles to hinder its progress. I firmly believe that the future of China and Japan will surely bear good fruit, and the Greater East Asia War will surely be victorious. Shanghai is the economic center of China and the great rear area of the Greater East Asia War. As for my concerns about Shanghai, production must be increased, and prices must be suppressed. This is not only necessary during wartime, but also necessary for the national economy and the people's livelihood. I deeply hope that Minister Aoki will provide more assistance so that my beliefs can be realized, and then the future of China and Japan and the future of Shanghai will have unlimited development. I thank Minister Aoki for his presence and wish Minister Aoki good health." Minister Aoki then gave a reply, saying: "I have been ordered to come to China this time to inspect the progress of the new policy towards China, and to exchange opinions on Sino-Japanese issues with all of you and the important figures of the National Government, and to hold various cordial talks with Japanese people in China. Passing through Shanghai, I am very grateful for the invitation of Mayor Chen tonight, and I am deeply delighted to reunite with old friends. The progress of this inspection is good, and I am deeply impressed by your country's dedication to reconstruction. China and Japan are adjacent to each other, and the history of friendship is very long and profound, and there should not be any differences. The new policy of Japan is nothing more than to restore the relationship between the two countries to its original state. Recently, I traveled to Southeast Asia, and the people there have a strong idea of building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. There has been good cooperation in various aspects such as economic stability and security. The independence of the Philippines will be realized soon, and I deeply hope that independence and self-preservation can be completed as soon as possible, so that the establishment of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere can have a more powerful guarantee. As for the construction of the new Shanghai, I am especially concerned about it. Yesterday, I visited Mayor Chen and was impressed by his aspirations for building the new Shanghai. I greatly admire this lofty ideal, and we must actively assist, so that Shanghai will not only be the economic center of China, but also a link of friendship between China and Japan. I would like to take advantage of the host's toast to wish the construction of Greater Shanghai a success, and for the health of Mayor Chen and everyone."</p>
<h3>Rice in the Forty-Fifth Period Unsold, Sales Order Not Yet Issued</h3>
<p>The Datong News Agency reports: Today is the last day for selling rice for the household registration in the forty-fourth period, ending at 6:00 PM, and sales will cease. It is understood that the sales order for rice for the household registration in the forty-fifth period has not yet been issued by the Rice Flour Procurement Section as of yesterday. This is because they must wait for the Rice and Grain Joint Operation Cooperative to notify the exact amount of rice supplied for this period before it can be issued. The total amount of rice supplied by the Joint Operation Cooperative for the household registration in the 18th and 2nd districts for the months of July and August is still less than 60,000 bags. Otherwise, not only could the previous shortages be fully compensated, but the sales quantity could have been adjusted earlier.</p>

<p>Police Officer Died in the Line of Duty, Family Urges Trial</p>
<p>On July 18th of this year, police officers Shen He Qing and Jiang E died in the line of duty while bravely pursuing robbers. All sectors of the city, standing on the side of justice, expressed their sorrow and sympathy. The families of Shen and Jiang hired lawyer Cheng Zhengping to file a lawsuit with the former Special First Court of this city, along with a civil suit. However, due to the time coinciding with the recovery of the concessions in this city, the case was indefinitely postponed. According to a Central News Agency reporter, the plaintiffs in the civil suit, seeking a swift resolution to the case and to avoid prolonged suffering, have specially filed a petition with the [blank] Method Court of this city, [blank] ordering the relevant [blank] parties to be summoned for trial within a specified period, and a clear and fair judgment be made to console the deceased.</p>
<p>Sino-Japanese Journalists' Symposium Postponed</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Shanghai: Mayor Chen and Minister Lin of the Department of Industry and Commerce, recognizing the importance of the trends in music, drama, culture, and other aspects of this city after the recovery of the Shanghai concessions, were pleased to convene a symposium with prominent figures in the local music scene at the Baohua Comfort Hotel on the afternoon of the 19th of this month. Furthermore, symposiums with the drama, culture, and Sino-Japanese journalist communities, originally scheduled to be held separately on the 23rd and 24th of this month, have been temporarily postponed due to Minister Lin's illness.</p>
<p>Second Police Bureau Issues New Seal</p>
<p>After the recovery of the two concessions in this city, the municipal government, in order to strengthen the city's police administration and establish local security, renamed the police organs in the first and third districts as the First and Third Police Bureaus. The original Municipal Police Bureau was renamed the Second Police Bureau, and all district police bureaus remained under the jurisdiction and command of the Second Police Bureau. It is understood that the seal of the Second Bureau has been issued by the municipal government, and the director of the Bureau, Lu Ying, has been ordered to assign personnel to receive and use it. The old seal will be truncated and handed over for cancellation.</p>
<p>Salt Tax Bureau Investigates and Prohibits Unusual Salt Speculation</p>
<p>In order to actively suppress the black market for salt in this city and prevent hoarding and speculation, the General Bureau of Salt Tax Administration of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui has not only ordered the Songjiang District Salt Affairs Administration Bureau to conduct strict investigations at any time, but the bureau has also dispatched commissioners to supervise and conduct district-by-district investigations of salt shops and sauce workshops in this city to determine if there is any hoarding, speculation, or price gouging. Once discovered, they will be sent to the court for punishment according to the law.</p>

<p>Letter Received</p>
<p>To the Editor of Shen Bao: Regarding the news article about the match rationing published in your newspaper on August 22, after investigation, the draft military rules for match rationing have been submitted to the relevant authorities and are under review. The reported rationing quantities, prices, and number of retailers are likely based on hearsay and are not reliable. Any news releases from our association regarding match-related matters are always sent to the Commercial Control Commission for review and publication, which is more accurate. We are writing this letter to clarify and request a correction. Sincerely, The United Association of Match Industries. August 23</p>

<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<p>Economic problems are complex. Whether one studies economics or manages finances, one must use a calm mind to critically assess and handle them. Impatience and arbitrariness are to be avoided. Furthermore, one must use facts as evidence to arrive at definite and unshakeable conclusions. Currently, the economic volatility in Shanghai is extreme, and the general population is living in a state of anxiety. This is highly regrettable and requires immediate correction.</p>
<p>We believe that the following three points should be noted:</p>
<p>Pay attention to numbers: When a problem arises, one must first pay attention to the increase or decrease in its numerical value. Use numbers to determine whether to accept or reject, and do not make judgments based on rumors.</p>
<p>Base on facts: Rumors are often unfounded. The source of all information must be verified with the original agency or location to determine if it is based on evidence and has a source. Otherwise, one will inevitably be fooled and suffer losses.</p>
<p>Analyze the rationale: When a fact is released, one must first inquire whether it is reasonable and feasible. One must also compare it with past experiences and scenarios, and consult widely before making a judgment. Otherwise, relying solely on personal prejudices to make criticisms and speculations will inevitably lead to errors.</p>
<p>Aquatic Products Administration Plans Fishery Loans</p>
<p>The Aquatic Products Administration is actively planning fishery loans to alleviate the economic pressure on fishermen and to encourage increased production. It is understood that the implementation plan for these loans has been finalized and will be submitted to the Ministry of Food to request approval from the Executive Yuan before being implemented. In the future, it will benefit fishermen, help increase production, and contribute to the establishment of a wartime economic system.</p>
<p>The plan's content is as follows: First, establish a loan headquarters in Shanghai. If necessary, establish branch offices in various fishing areas to ensure widespread coverage. The initial fund for the first year is tentatively set at 1 million national currency. For the second year, request an additional appropriation of 1 million yuan to expand the loan amount. If this is still insufficient, fisheries construction fees can be used as collateral to borrow 2 million yuan from banks, or cooperate with the Shanghai Fisheries Bank to concentrate funds for lending.</p>
<p>Loan recipients are limited to legitimate fishermen, such as [blank] marine fishing boats, ice-fresh fishing boats, river fish customers, and fish farmers. Fish collectors and storage warehouses are strictly prohibited from receiving loans to prevent hoarding. Loan types are divided into two categories: credit loans and mortgage loans. Loan allocation is divided equally between marine fisheries and freshwater fisheries, each accounting for 50%. Each loan will be for a period of six months, with a small interest rate.</p>
<p>In addition to cash, the repayment method also allows for the use of fish catches to offset the price, thereby avoiding losses due to price depreciation during the period, and demonstrating the government's utmost concern for the fishermen.</p>
<p>Western Medicine Rationing Plan Not Yet Decided</p>
<p>It is widely rumored in Shanghai that Western medicine will soon be subject to centralized rationing. The rationing method will be similar to the rationing of cigarettes by the China Central Tobacco Rationing Association. The first step is for Chinese and Japanese pharmaceutical factories to jointly form a rationing agency, which will then survey all pharmacies in the city, classify them into A, B, C, and D grades, and then distribute goods according to the grades. This news has attracted much attention from all parties. According to investigations, several Chinese and Japanese pharmaceutical manufacturers had discussed this matter two weeks ago, but a concrete plan has not yet been decided. This is because there are many types of Western medicine with different uses. Before implementing rationing, a detailed rationing method must be carefully decided to avoid problems. If rationing is implemented and a black market emerges, as with cigarettes, with small vendors lining up to buy while patients cannot purchase medicine, the serious consequences will be unimaginable. At the same time, after the establishment of the General Commercial Control Association, the centralized rationing of various goods in this city should logically fall under the purview of the association and should not, like the China Central Tobacco Rationing Association, establish a separate agency to implement rationing independently. Therefore, looking ahead, there are still various problems with the establishment of a Western medicine rationing association. It is also reported that some Western medicine manufacturers have already independently implemented a rationing system. This rationing system has not been authorized by the relevant authorities, nor has it been publicly announced to society or revealed its details. Therefore, it is unknown whether there are still problems. In short, the centralized rationing of Western medicine is an important task, but since our country has the organization of the Commercial Control Association, this task should be borne by the association. Others should not overstep their authority, and the Commercial Control Association should not ignore it.</p>
<p>This Year's Tobacco Leaf Production Estimated at Approximately 5.2 Million Guan</p>
<p>The yield of tobacco leaves this year was slightly affected by unfavorable weather conditions a few days ago, but the total yield is still expected to increase by 30% compared to last year. The total yield for this year is estimated to be approximately 5.2 million guan (each guan is equivalent to 100 taels of Chinese weight). Currently, the China Central Tobacco Co., Ltd. has added many drying rooms to the tobacco production areas, totaling 1,600 drying rooms, and repaired 2,000 rooms.</p>
<p>Brief News</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Insurance Brokers Association held its second preparatory meeting a few days ago, passed the articles of association, and tentatively scheduled to convene a general membership meeting at the latest in early September to formally establish the association.</p>
<p>The New China Industrial Company held a temporary shareholders' meeting on the 22nd to discuss a capital increase plan. Chairman Xu Guanqun presided over the meeting, and Manager Shi Ziquan reported on the company's business overview. It was resolved to increase capital by 14 million yuan, which, together with the original capital of 6 million yuan, would bring the total capital to 20 million yuan. Each old share will be given one and a half shares, and half a share will be subscribed, with 5 yuan to be paid in cash. In addition, it will issue 500,000 yuan at a premium, with each share priced at 15 yuan, and entrust the New Asia Construction Company to underwrite the shares. Old shareholders will have priority in subscribing, and the period will be from August 26 to September 6.</p>
<p>Trend of Chinese Stocks</p>
<p>Yesterday, most Chinese stocks rose, but public confidence has stabilized. Department stores, state-owned goods companies, and China Underwear both had new stocks open. The former traded at 1.4 times the face value, and the latter traded at approximately two times the face value. Wing On Company's decline was slight, while Sincere Company had not yet opened. King Fook socks showed a slight decline, and King Lun declined considerably. The textile industry also saw small fluctuations. Wing On Textile was unstable again, while Mayar was heavily traded and declined significantly. Small-face-value stocks such as Hung Sang, Sino, Lun Hwa, Greater China, and Weaving have seen low-price absorption. In the pharmaceutical industry, only Shanghai Union Drugstore had news of a capital increase, standing out from the rest. Stepping Up was strong, with demand exceeding supply. New Asia and Sino-French saw lower prices, while Chinese and Western Star both stood at their original prices. New Star Flour stood still, and Scientific Chemicals had few buyers. In the cultural industry, China Book Company and Wing Cheung Printing Company saw stability, while Commercial Press and World Book Company saw declines. Standard Paper Products and Chin Feng Paper were flat. Nanyang Brothers Tobacco and Great China Matches were both flat. Kiu-an Industrial and New Asia Construction both declined. Lian Hwa, New Benefit, and Wing Hing real estate also showed softening, but there were still buyers at low prices. Hong Yuan Confectionery saw further declines, while Standard Gourmet Powder stood firm at its original price. Kwong Sang Hong and Amoy Canning stood at their original prices. Central and Han-Yeh-Ping Coal Mining had inquiries at low prices, while Family Industries also saw declines. In public utilities, Shanghai and Cheung Sang rickshaws were flat. Chapei Water &amp; Electricity and China General Edison were also in slight decline, with the latter falling to the threshold. Security Glass was opened after rights, trading at approximately 30% above face value. Financial stocks had few sellers.</p>
<p>Summary of Business Conditions</p>
<p>Government Bonds: Unified government bonds were firm, with Types A, B, D, and E all rising, while Type C fell slightly.</p>
<p>Interbank Lending Rate: The interbank lending rate of the Money Trade Association remained at 24%.</p>
<p>Rice and Grains: Nearly 1,000 bags of goods arrived from various regions. Retail buyers made some purchases, but wholesale sales were weak. Large profit holders were selling off, so the market was weakening. New keng late rice was slightly lower than the previous market, and Yuan Chen qingcan was also weak. Shipments of Changzhou cowhide soybeans arrived in succession. There was little trade in social beans, old sand yellow beans, bean cakes, and other items.</p>
<p>Rayon: Buyers were still scarce. Manufacturers had stopped buying, and hoarders were mostly stopping their purchases and selling off. The market continued to weaken.</p>
<p>Tea: The tea market was still lacking in excitement. The new pharmaceutical chemical factory's interest in red tea cores remained sluggish, and stores were still only adding small amounts. However, black tea flower patterns were still favored by actual consumers. However, those holding the goods were supplying little due to limited market inventory. Only about 6 dan of Chi Check Green Tea was traded in the whole city, reportedly at a price of 2 kuan per dan. There were also over 20 bags of stamped green tea, with prices traded at 1,000 kuan per dan. In addition, there were five boxes of Keemun black tea.</p>

<p>Regarding the Teachers and Staff Consumer Cooperative, The Local Education Sector Expresses its Solemn Stance</p>
<p>Mr. Jiang Shoutong's proposal to establish a consumer cooperative for teachers and staff in this city has been taken seriously by all sectors. Teachers and staff themselves certainly hope it will become a reality, reducing their living burden. People in society who understand the principle also express their sympathy and urge its realization. This newspaper previously expressed its willingness to collect opinions from all parties and publish the essentials, in order to pool ideas and discuss together. Now, Zhu Sihuang, Li Quanshi, and 15 other professors have submitted collective opinions, which are disclosed as follows. The professors are speaking from the standpoint of educators, expressing a shared sentiment that is profound and solemn. It is hoped that all sectors will pay attention. -Editor's Note</p>
<p>After Mr. Jiang Shoutong proposed the organization of a "Shanghai Teachers and Staff Consumer Cooperative" on the 19th of this month, he has successively obtained the support of all parties. From the standpoint of educators, we are willing to contribute the following opinions:</p>
<p>First, it is absolutely necessary to establish a permanent Shanghai Teachers and Staff Consumer Cooperative to eliminate the exploitation of middlemen. In particular, at present, the rise and fall of all prices are being manipulated by merchants who hoard and speculate. In order to reduce the burden on teachers and staff and stabilize the lives of teachers and staff and their families, the organization of a cooperative is not only necessary, but also an urgent self-defense measure.</p>
<p>Second, precisely because this is a self-defense measure related to the teachers and staff themselves, our standpoint must be pure. Apart from solving the living difficulties of teachers and staff, there is no other purpose or side effect. Even the accumulated funds or profits that the cooperative itself should obtain are not allowed to exist. Our slogan is: "Every penny is used on the teachers and staff!"</p>
<p>Third, the original plan was for each member (teacher or staff) to invest 200 yuan, with 100 yuan being borrowed from the school administration and 100 yuan being paid by each member. This may be unaffordable for elementary school teachers and staff, so for elementary school teachers and staff, we propose halving the amount, while their rights should be the same as those of middle and high school teachers and staff.</p>
<p>Fourth, in order to save on the operating expenses of the cooperative, the investigation work and distribution procedures can adopt a school unit system. That is, the investigation, collection, and distribution work is carried out by the school authorities, and the cooperative stands in a supervisory position.</p>
<p>Fifth, the establishment of the cooperative should be expedited and divided into the following steps:</p>
<p>The newspaper should temporarily set aside a space to serve as a reader mailbox for the organization of a teachers and staff consumer cooperative, where readers can express their opinions and nominate candidates for the preparatory committee.</p>
<p>After a week, the nominated candidates will be announced and summarized, and each school will make a public decision.</p>
<p>Once the preparatory committee is established, it should first negotiate the allocation of goods and the issuance of procurement certificates.</p>
<p>If there is hope for allocation or procurement, the registration and investment procedures for teachers and staff in each school should be carried out.</p>
<p>Appeal to the public for donations.</p>
<p>Start procuring materials and implement distribution.</p>
<p>The important and far-reaching cause of education is closely related to the national life and the future of the country. We dare not boast of the sanctity of our work, but we dare not neglect the mission of the times. We are very grateful for all external personnel assistance, but we dare not easily accept it. We are willing to use our own strength, through automatic organization, to make up for the deficiencies in our lives. We believe that the citizens of the city will certainly give their greatest sympathy.</p>

<p>A Visit to the Yangjingbang Catholic Church (4)</p>
<p>Free Clinics, Free Medicine, Free Food, Free Clothing</p>
<p>The biggest ills in society are poverty and disease. The Yangjingbang Catholic Church is doing its best to provide relief to the poor and sick by offering free clinics, free medicine, free food, and free clothing.</p>
<p>Behind the Catholic Church, at the entrance of a small alley called Yong'an Street in the slum area, hangs a wooden sign that says "Ren Shan Tang Children's Clinic." From time to time, the cries of children can be heard, which is one of the free clinic and free medicine initiatives sponsored by the Catholic Action Association of the Catholic Church, specializing in treating poor children. The doctors include traditional Chinese medicine practitioner Mr. Wang Yisan and Western medicine practitioner Mr. Zhou Weiliang, who both volunteer their services. About 40 to 50 patients are treated every day. It has always been completely free, but now, due to the high cost of medicine, each patient is charged a nominal fee of one yuan, but the extremely poor are still exempt.</p>
<p>The Catholic Charity Clinic is the first initiative of free clinics and free medicine launched by the Yangjingbang Catholic Church, with a history of more than 70 years. It is now attached to Ren Shan Tang in Hongqiao Lane in the city. Traditional Chinese medicine practitioner Wang Yisan lives in the hall and regularly provides consultations. According to Sister Pan, the actual achievements last year included 43,741 outpatient visits, 51,049 prescriptions, 835 house calls, 10,713 free consultations and medication for prisoners, 14,675 free consultations and medication for infants at Renji Nursery, and 16,800 free consultations and medication for the Renji Charity Hall. It can be seen that the actual benefits to society are truly significant.</p>
<p>On South Datong Road, New Gate Road, on a bustling city street, like some kind of ornament, there is a two-story "Catholic Charitable Clinic." It is already crowded with patients seeking treatment by 8 a.m. Men, women, the old, and the young, with festering hands and feet, like an exhibition of diseases, the</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn and Cloth: Purchase Starting Yesterday</h3>
<p>The purchase office is located at the Racecourse of the National Commercial Control Association. Following the order to purchase cotton yarn and cloth, a purchase office for cotton yarn and cloth has been established. Starting yesterday (the 23rd), it will handle the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth within the Shanghai area in accordance with the directives of the Executive Yuan, the promulgated Provisional Regulations for the Purchase of Cotton Yarn and Cloth, the Implementation Outline, and detailed rules, and will also handle the supplementary registration of cotton yarn and cloth as ordered.</p>
<p>Application for Sale</p>
<p>The association has announced the following procedures: All owners or occupants of cotton yarn and cloth within the Shanghai area (including merchants of all nationalities other than Japanese) should fill out four copies each of the application for sale and the summary of sale for all their cotton yarn, grey cotton cloth, or processed cotton cloth, and submit them to this office or send them through the respective trade associations (application forms and summaries can be obtained from this office). All cotton yarn and cloth that has not been registered with this association should be registered at the same time as obtaining the application for sale and the summary by obtaining a registration form from this association. When submitting the application for sale and the summary for processed cotton cloth and grey cotton cloth not manufactured by yarn factories, two samples of the goods should be attached.</p>
<p>Business Report</p>
<p>Retailers of cotton yarn and cloth should obtain blank business report forms from this office, fill in the monthly sales of yarn and cloth for the first half of the 32nd year of the Republic of China, and submit them to this office together with the application for sale and the summary for review. Factories that use yarn and cloth as raw materials for manufacturing or processing should obtain blank business report forms from this office, fill in the monthly usage of yarn and cloth for the first half of the 32nd year of the Republic of China, and submit them to this office together with the application for sale and the summary for review. Upon receiving the application for sale and the summary submitted by the applicant, this office will stamp it with a number and return one copy to the seller for safekeeping. Upon receiving the registration form for supplementary registration, this office will stamp it with a seal and return one copy to the registrant for safekeeping.</p>
<p>Exchange Certificate for Deposit Slip</p>
<p>After the cotton yarn and cloth for which sale has been applied has been inspected and approved by this office, the amount of the price has been determined, and the inspection and acceptance have been completed, this office will notify the applicant within five days to exchange the notification for a special fixed deposit exchange certificate from this office, and then collect the special fixed deposit slip from the Central Reserve Bank. All applications for sale, summaries, business reports, and registration forms for supplementary registration must be submitted to this office within fifteen days from today (deadline September 6). Overdue applications will be dealt with according to law. It is reported that the Yarn and Cloth Purchase Office moved to the Racecourse on Route Maréchal Foch yesterday.</p>
<p>List of Members of the Assessment Committee</p>
<p>The National Commercial Control Association's Cotton Yarn and Cloth Purchase Office has been established for many days and is now beginning to carry out the purchase work. According to Article 5 of the Organizational Outline of the office, the quality and price of the purchased yarn and cloth will be assessed by a separate Cotton Yarn and Cloth Quality and Price Assessment Committee. It has been learned that the candidates for the committee have been recommended by the United Association of Cotton Product Industries and have been formally appointed by the Commercial Control Association yesterday. The names of the members are Bu Boxun, Xu Xiuxiao, Ping Qibo, Mi Wenjun, Qin Defang, Wu Shihhuai, Chen Shouyi, Yang Yuelin, Wu Xinqi, Ying Yuanzai, Gong Dingluo, Zheng Weizhang, Zhou Rongsun, Fang Weiping, Zou Zhaolin, Guo Zhongkang, Wu Mingyong, and seventeen others.</p>
<p>150,000 Pieces Still Unregistered</p>
<p>The government authorities announced the compulsory purchase of cotton yarn and cloth regulations in this city on the 9th of this month, and nearly half a month has passed. The investigation of the inventory in public and private warehouses in this city has already been completed by the Materials Investigation Office. It is reported that there are currently more than 700 public and private warehouses in the city, with a total of 194,839 pieces of cotton yarn stored, including 79,718 pieces belonging to Japanese merchants. However, aside from the registered cotton yarn, more than 150,000 pieces have not yet completed the registration procedures with the relevant authorities. In order to protect the rights and interests of the holders of this cotton yarn, the Materials Investigation Office has decided to extend the registration deadline by fifteen days. If registration is not completed after the deadline, regardless of nationality, it will be unconditionally confiscated. The disposal of cotton cloth is completely the same.</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn Allocation Plan Undecided</p>
<p>Furthermore, regarding the allocation of yarn and cloth after the purchase, it was rumored yesterday that it would be implemented soon. According to official sources, the yarn and cloth allocation plan is still being formulated. The authorities are paying close attention to this matter, but it seems too early to determine the date of implementation. Technical issues such as the allocation quantity have not yet been finalized. The saying that each person consumes ten yards of yarn and cloth per year is only an estimate of past yarn and cloth consumption and is not necessarily the amount to be allocated in the future.</p>

<h3>Welfare Cup Charity Soccer: Friendship Loses 1-2 to Italian Navy Team; Ball Sold Three Times for 220,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>The Welfare Cup Charity Soccer Match was held at the Racecourse at 5:30 pm yesterday, with over 10,000 spectators. Mayor Chen and Minister Wu officiated the opening kick. The Italian Navy team was photographed in the middle. Actresses Hu Feng, Li Qiuxia, Li Hong, and Chen Juanjuan hosted the auction. The competition was intense. The first ball was sold for 50,000 yuan by Pan Sansheng. It was re-auctioned, and Ma Dehong bought it for 50,000 yuan. The third ball was won by Xia Shikui, with a price of 120,000 yuan, setting an unprecedented record for ball purchases. The total proceeds from the ball auction were 220,000 yuan. After the match, the prizes were awarded by Committee Chairman Cen, Minister Luo, Secretary-General Zhao, Shen Siliang, Shao Chang, Yuan Ludeng, Wen Lanting, Minister Ding, and others. As a result of the match, Friendship lost 1-2 to the Italian Navy team due to the weakness of the forward line. Both sides began to clash. The Italian Navy's five forwards penetrated deep into the defensive zone. Friendship's goalkeeper, Xian Han, saved a goal, preventing the team from conceding a corner kick. Lian Sheng’s attack was lost. Friendship tried to counterattack, but it was difficult. The Italian Navy's offensive was strong. In the fifth minute, Ling Weitai made a small test and Friendship lost again, making it 2-0. In the twenty-fifth minute, Fei Chunjie went straight through the line, picked up the ball well, and Meng Liang headed it desperately, but the ball went inches past the post. After several passes, the team was penalized for a handball. Zheng Yingquan lost the free kick. At the end of the first half, Friendship was down by two goals. During the second half, Li Yichen of Friendship shot the ball into the net in the chaotic situation. The ball was declared invalid and was considered off-side. After 12 minutes, the Italian Navy's Stephen fouled and Song Lingsheng kicked a 12-yard ball and the goal was scored. Friendship had a revival, but the Italian army has a tight defense. At the end of the hour, the Friendship lost to the Italian Navy by the score of 2 to 1.</p>

Private primary and secondary schools will receive monthly subsidies of 500,000 yuan initiated by Mayor Chen. It is reported that the allocation of this 500,000 yuan will be distributed appropriately based on the member schools that have joined the City Education Association. Each member school must promptly submit a detailed list of teachers and staff for the bureau to review. Furthermore, starting next semester, all private schools will be closely supervised and directed by the authorities, emphasizing practical education so that every student can advance in moral, intellectual, physical, and social education. In addition to classes, students must be led to organize various beneficial groups to ensure a disciplined life.</p>
