<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c1">我們要創造鏡子 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>昨天我們論列日本第四屆中央協力會議，集合各地民間代表，討論各項福國利民之計，凡對政府施行方針有所指摘之處，政府官吏即席說明理由，凡經討論決定之建議方案，政府官吏即席表示鄭重接受。如此，民意旣有充分發揮的機會，政府更有坦白接受的誠意，就是政府與人民打成一片，發生渾然力量的關健所在。因之，我們獻言，應以日本此種會議當作一面鏡子，我們詳細的審察一番，照出所有一切的斑紋，必須加以澈底的洗滌與整容。但是，這一面鏡子可惜不是我們的，如果僅僅把他們所照出的斑紋，如果僅僅把他們所用的洗滌與整容方法，依樣的來引用一下，也許斑紋不盡相同，洗滌方法有不十分妥切適合的地方。所以，爲了詳細照出我們自己的斑紋，爲了採取更適切的洗滌方法，我們需要自己創造一面鏡子，而且，這一面鏡子必須是平滑準確，絕不走樣的。</p>
<p>其次，憑藉這一面準確的鏡子所照出的斑紋，它的種類必定很多，有的是表皮的塵垢，有的是黏靱的脂膏，有的是深刻的墨水，於是洗滌的方法也就有不同的適應。　如要用毛巾的，肥皂的，刷子的。獨用的或者兼用的。知道了斑紋的種類與所在，有了洗滌的方法，最後而重要的就是切切實實的依照方法從事洗滌，如果錯用方法，則斑紋表面雖去而痕跡不淸；如果錯認所在，則汚點並未洗滌，而皮膚反被擦傷。這在洗滌過程中都應小心翼翼地行使的。</p>
<p>根據上面的陳述，可以分爲四個步驟：第一是創造準確的鏡子；第二是詳細審察所有的斑紋；第三，鑑別斑紋的種類決定適切的洗滌方法；第四，依照洗滌方法，認淸斑紋所在，切實不苟的用力洗滌。這四個步驟前後連貫，相互牽掣，缺了一步旣不可，忽略一步也不成。自始至終，母懈母怠，才能洗刷斑紋，容顏一新。</p>
<p>我們所說的，似乎過於抽象了。其實不然，我們必須先把這事件比喻出來，大家腦海裏對此有了印象，有了輪廓，然後大家才覺得這事件的重要性與必然性。</p>
<p>我們再要問，如果我們面上有了斑紋，是不是需要立即洗滌凈盡呢？這個答案，必然是衆口一辭的說「絕對的需要」！那末，我們就竭力促成這一事件的實現吧！</p>
<p>然則，這一面鏡子究竟是怎樣構成的？怎樣去審視斑紋？怎樣去決定洗法？怎樣去實行洗滌呢？第一，鏡子就是民意機構，人民參與政治發表民意的機構。由各地各界純粹人民推舉的代表所構成的機構。第二，審視斑紋就是民間代表於集會時各自陳述民間疾苦，政治經濟的病態。第三，決定洗法，就是民間代表各本自身經騐與見解，交換意見，相互討論作成建議方案。第四，實行洗滌就是政府當局誠意接受民意機構所作的建議方案，通飭各級各主管機關切實執行，同時，民間代表返回當地後，充分向所代表的人民大衆闡釋建議方案的內容和意義，俾大衆瞭解，協助政府執行。</p>
<p>這種民意機構的性質，就像我們連日介紹的日本大政翼贊會召集的中央協力會議之類。所以，更可以說，日本大政翼贊會以至中央協力會議，就是日本創造的爲自己照斑紋的鏡子。日本各地民間代表參加中央協力會議，就是對了鏡子詳細照出面容上的斑紋，日本民間代表交換意見決定建議，就是針對斑紋的洗滌方法。日本政府官吏的列席報告以及聲明接受建議與切實執行建議，就是用力於實施洗滌。在這種步步踏實，上下一體的奮進之下，當然斑紋可除，容顏整潔，同時更注意隨時營養，不難容光煥新了。</p>
<p>我們的國家，當前的政治·經濟形態，人民生活狀况，不必諱言，比較日本脆弱與困難得多。也就是面容上的斑紋比較更多。那末，人家面上斑紋少的，尙嫌醜惡而創製鏡子，可以隨時對照，隨地洗滌。難道我們面上斑紋多的，就甘於醜惡而不知製鏡對照以至洗滌呢？於此，我們應當嚴肅的指陳，日本政府的備有審察斑紋的鏡子，幷不是他們的愚笨，也不是多事。而我們政府的不備鏡子，却不是我們的聰明，也不是省事，更不是沒有斑紋，而是我們政府當局對此未予重視，或是雖能重視而顧慮太多，終於創不起來。這在政府與人民不能取得打成一片的渾凝力量，實在是莫大的遺憾。</p>
<p>當此國際形勢漸趨決定階段，大東亞戰爭勝利有待努力爭取之際，我們的責任非常艱巨，全憑我們的努力以決定未來的地位，所以，更其感覺上下一心集中力量的必要。我們始終認爲純粹的民意機構，足以溝通與揉合政府與人民之間的意見與力量者，在今天更有迅速建立的必要。</p>

<p>南京二十九日中央社電　最高領袖在主席爲巡視上　之一般狀况，特不避炎暑，於二十九日下午四時十五分　機飛　。三時許各機關長官徐蘇中·陳羣·李聖五·顧寳　·鮑文越·業蓬·任援道·及日本寺岡海軍顧問，滿大使呂榮寰等，均先後蒞機塲歡送。三時五十分最高領袖汪主席御白色國民禮服蒞臨，於中外長官恭送聲中，即僭同行政院秘書長陳春圃，及建設部長陳君慧，外交部次長周隆庠，軍事委員陳昌祖等登機。友邦柴山中將，亦隨機飛滬。一時軍樂悠揚、情緒極爲熱烈。四時正引擎發動，機身即冉冉上升。俄頃銀灰色之海鶼號專機，即越過紫金山嶺向東飛去。</p>
<p>中央社滬訊，此次國府收囘上海租界，打破百年來國家民族所受於英美侵略主義者之枷鎖，實現國父「廢除不平等條約」「求中國之自由平等」之遺志，萬民歡騰。主席對於久受英美侵略主義壓迫榨取下之五百萬民衆，關懷至切，而對於恢復主權後之上海，期望尤殷，昨日下午五時，以元首之資格，駕蒞上海視察、聽取現地報告，垂詢官民意見、指示努力方針。在滬各機關長官聆訊，於昨日下午三時齊集市府準備迎迓，四時出發。是日親赴機塲恭迎者有陳市長公博，周部長佛海，林部長柏生，褚部長民館，工部長默邨，梅部長思平，羅部長君强，李省長士羣，趙秘書長叔雍，蘇成德，岑德廣，馬嘯天，戴英夫，劉仰山，巫關溪，及友邦各機關長官等百餘人。五時十分　主席座駕機蒞臨上海空中，各恭迎長官均在機塲排立，廿　時分，座駕機安抵機塲，由　市長新詣機門迎　。主席身　新國民禮服，精神奕奕，含笑與恭迎者爲禮。隨行老有陳秘書長春圃，陳部長君慧，周次長隆庠。主席離機塲後，即乘座駕車經行兩租界，直赴行轅休息。上海兩租界民衆，聞悉主席蒞滬，莫不喜形於色，各繁盛馬路，均滿縣歡迎標語，情緒異常熱烈。</p>
<p>中央社二十九日南京電　宣傳部公報，汪主席本日離京駕抵上海。</p>
<p>去月三十日，友邦日本與我國訂定八月一日實施交還上海公共租界之時，主席曾發表談話，</p>
<p>昭告國人（一）「必須竭其熱忱，盡其能力，使上海公共租界更致於安定與繁榮」；（二）「吾人尤須使上海公共租界在精神物質兩方面將英美百年以來所浸漬之流毒，洗滌淨　」；（三）「使此英美侵略主義之根據地，一變而爲中國獨立自主之門戶，大東亞共榮圈之　帶，進而爲世界和平之交通要點」；（四）「此次上海公共租界交還以後，有待於政府民衆之協力者正多，吾人當以邁往之精神，擔當一切，以償　國父廢除不平等條約之遺志，以不負友邦日本援助之盛意，以副全國民衆熱烈之期望」；（五）「吾人並深望其他關係各國，這隨友邦日本之後，對於上海公共租界之交還，迅速予以倣行」；（六）「更以最善之努力，進而與法國洽商；務使上海法租界之交還，最遲於本年八月一日以前得以實現」；經一月以來之努力，及友邦善意之斡旋，義大利已與我國訂定同時交還上海公共租界行政權，法租界之收回，亦得以如期於本月三十日實行。</p>
<p>百年以來幾爲英美侵略主　者刦奪以去之上海，至此復歸於完　，收囘租界之工作，至此獲告成功，國父「廢除不平等條約」，「求中國之自由平等」之遺志，至此得以實現。此固由於全國民衆多年艱苦奮鬥所換取得來，抑井由於大東亞戰爭排除英美在東亞之侵略勢力，由於和平運動，遵奉國父倡導國民革命，以救中國，以保東亞之不易方針，由於我國之參戰，隨友邦之後，與東亞民族團結一致，同生共死，由於友邦實　其援助我國完成獨立自主之眞意，使我國得於殘破之餘，從事復興，以分担其爲東亞共榮　獨立自主一份子之權責，　主席對於久在英美侵略主義者榨取下之五百萬民衆，關懷至切，對於上海之將來，期望至股，對於掃盪英美侵略主義之餘毒，促進中日兩國之親善提携，以完遂戰爭，而致東亞民族於共存共榮，尤深　念，此次蒞滬視察，將聽取現地報告，　詢官民意見，指示努力方針，期以政府與民衆之</p>
<p>共同努力展開建設新上海之偉大運動，以貢獻於新中國與新東亞之建設，務使上海爲中國獨立自主之門戶，中國爲東亞共榮圈獨立自主之國家。國家元首，以元首之地位蒞臨上海，此爲第一次，斯實爲領土主權完整之具體表徵，不特上海五百萬市民咸盛激奮發，全國民衆亦同深歡騰。主席此次蒞滬，旣重策勵民，衆，　力興事保亞之大業，對於公式宴會，及繁文縟節，一律謝絕。惟各界領袖均渴望晋謁聆訓，主席將分別定期茶會接待，以便聽取意見，宣示方針。</p>

<p>東京二十九日中央社電　日情報局堀第三部長於二十八日接見中國記者團時，就中國收囘上海公共租界事，發表談話，大意如次：中國在不平等條約下，供英美金圓主義之犧牲者已歷百年，英美侵略中國之象徵，實即爲上海公共租界，英美以此爲根據地，用其侵略　手於全中國而形成復興中國之一大障碍，中國有識人士，爲排除英美金圓主義，數十年如一日，無時不在與英美鬥爭中，中國國父孫中山先生賚志以歿。然形成英美金圓主義之侵略對象，及爲其重壓所苦固不僅爲中國一國，而爲東亞全體。民國卅年十二月八日日本爲使東亞復於東亞人之手，乃斷然崛起，痛擊英美在東亞之據點，未及半載，英美勢力巳自大東亞各地掃除，今猶僅渝方而已，茲中國國民政府，即將於八月一日收囘英美侵略中圃之象徵地，上海公共租界，此舉不　足以說明中國已脫離不平等條約之桎梏，且爲英美金圓主義永遠消滅於東亞之象徵，故其意義殊爲深長。上海公共租界收囘後，以大上海市之一部貢獻於中國復興者，當屬甚大，惟使與英美侵略主要據點，成爲復興中國之中根，尙須更大之努力方克成功。惟余確信中國官民，今後必能一致協力，以不屈不撓之決意，使其得到圓滿之發展。</p>

<p>汪主席對日記者談</p>
<h3 id="c10">南洋與中國經濟提携　解決華僑問題貢獻中日合作　增加生產補救物資不足 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>朝日新聞社主筆緒方氏，視察南方諸地域歷時一月，於歸國途中，道經南京，二十日午後五時，訪問汪主席於其官邸，懇談視察南方的感想與結論，並交換意見。會談以中國問題及南方問題爲中心，汪主席在談話中對中國問題的解決與南方問題的關聯有重要的暗示，極堪重視。其談話大要如次：</p>
<p>中日基本條約問題</p>
<p>東條首相在前次臨時議會中，關於東亞諸民族團結的聲明，非常有意義。大東亞戰爭是保衛大東亞的戰爭，所以東亞十億民衆的團結是必然的。這東亞十億民衆中，中日滿實占其大半，即五億五千萬。因此，東條首相聲明改訂中日基本條約，給予中國民衆非常的感激與確信。</p>
<p>根本改訂條約的主旨、在於改變條約的指導精神、也就是條正條約的指導原理之一部。一貫於條約中的中日協力精神，常然無所變更，但環境業已變遷，即條約的締結業已三年，當時大東亞戰爭尙未發生，條約的規定，不能不顧慮英美的關係。但今日英美的勢力巳從大東亞地城驅逐出去，情勢業已一變，是以條約的改訂，實因環境的變更所致。</p>
<p>中日提携</p>
<p>我們曾說過同生共死的話，這決不是外交辭令，是我們眞正的精神。大東亞戰爭自然是必勝的，假使戰爭失敗，那麼我們就要共死，而所謂同生的意義，那就是說戰爭如其勝利，則中國可以從南洋獲得橡膠，汽油，小麥等一切物資的供給，南方與中國可有無相通，經濟提携。現在最切要的是戰爭業已變成長期戰，所以中日兩國應有同志的精神。中國在這長期戰中與日本完全立於同一的戰綫，戰至最後。</p>
<p>南方問題</p>
<p>自戰爭以來，南洋成爲日本的占領地，今日欲與第三國交流已不可能，故南洋華僑的狀况，一切均不明瞭。不過華僑雖有許多缺點、也有東洋民族的美點，例如具有勤勉的素質。他們雖受荷蘭的壓迫，而仍能奠定今日的地位者，完全是那種美德所致。所以如其能善爲領導這些華僑，而解決華僑問題，則相信對占領地的開拓定有很大的貢獻。</p>
<p>華僑問題的解決，在某種意義上是解決中國問題之鍵，在中日合作上，將有重大的貢獻吧。</p>
<p>中共問題</p>
<p>最近的重慶政權與中國共產黨的對立，似比以前的規模更大。蘇聯解散第三國際，給與重慶政權討共的口實，但此點尙未充分明瞭，重慶的外交，大體分親蘇與親英美二派，而後者在目前較爲得勢。所以重慶與中共對立遂　激化，但全面和平不會因此而有望。不過我個人的意見，重慶與中共衝突的局面發展下去而其　突不停止，則英美自然對此失望，於是重慶也將考慮和日本合作，那就是全面和平的機會。</p>
<p>物資問題</p>
<p>這不但是國民政府，而且是全體民衆現在最關心的問題。物資不足與通貨膨脹二種現象一同出現，無論如何是要設法解決的，如其通貨雖膨脹而物資流通，則不致於發生不安，因而問題的解決應歸着於生產的增加。例如：就米的問題看來，現在的和平地區，多係消費地的都市，而生產地的農村　少，從南洋輸入的米，又告杜絕，因而米遂盛不足。這祇要確保和平地區的治安，整理農村，就可解決又一面應該取製造工業品，運到內地，從內地換取食科品的手段。次就棉花而言，事變前年產千五百萬擔，去年激减約三分之一，僅五百萬擔。而且上海的工廠　能使用的棉花僅其一部、這因爲農民把棉花藏起來不出賣，譬如說現在棉紗每擔約三萬元，農民雖然出賣掉了米，但買不到棉紗棉布，所以多數在家庭中自行紡紗織布以自給　這對上海的輕工業有相當影響。這不過是幾個例子。總之，在物價問題上有很多的困難，不能不克服而解決之　現在國民政府第一步先使民衆澈底明瞭，向大東亞戰爭協力，唯有在獲得勝利後方是生存的大道。第二步賦與民衆以力量，努力不使民力涸竭　這是中國的問題，同時也是中日共同的問題。（翔：譯自七月二十三日西部朝日新聞）</p>

<p>羅馬廿九日中央社電　海通社訊，昨夜羅馬廣播電台評述員麥西摩發表文告謂、義大利現正爲自由而與共產主義及英美作戰，反軸心國於過去在廣播時及報新間，僅攻擊墨索里尼，現已　其本來面目，承認乃係與義大利人民作戰。義人根據已往之經騐，深知內中詳情，惟英美亦將獲有敎訓，此敎訓之代價至詎，因彼等將知義人能如何作戰也。義大利現正聯合爲人民及祖同作戰，該評述員續謂義大利並不需要等候英外柏艾登關於英美對義大利海外屬地所擬之措置、所謂大西洋憲章、總有一日成爲一紙廢物云。</p>
<p>索非亞二十九日中央社電　義大利新外長，迦里格利亞，昨日自土耳其乘機　赴義大利途中，在素非亞曾作短時之停留。迦氏與「索拉」報記者談話時，謂「義大利將繼續爲戰勝人類公敵而作戰。」</p>

<p>德義兩國關係</p>
<p>柏林二十九日中央社電　德外交部情報司司長施密特二十八日接見國際記者　時，曾說明此次義國政　亦影響於德義之關係。大意謂德義兩國之同盟關係，乃於希特勒元首與　素里尼二氏私人友情上而築成其强固之基礎者，爲世人共知之事實，德義兩國之同盟，乃因兩氏之私人緊密友情，及因德國國　社會主義革命與法西斯蒂革命之同一性而形成其特別關係。爲既承認此事實，即不能謂德義兩國國民之根本關係有所變更，蓋德義兩國國民之存亡問題，乃兩國同盟之自然基礎，同時爲對英美蘇聯共同鬥爭之基礎，不使英美屈服，不將歐洲之共產危機掃除，即不能確保向同一方向邁進之兩國國民的存亡利害。</p>
<p>英美對義態度</p>
<p>阿姆斯特丹二十九日中央社電　倫敦息：羅斯福總統昨夜廣播演講涉及與邱吉爾在下　中所論及之同一問題時，謂反軸心國對義大利之　度並不受其政府更迭之影饗，仍一貫要求其「無條件投降」，羅斯福論及蘇聯時，則謂美國於未來之世界巾，當願與其爲誠懸之友人，羅氏於演詞中總謂，未來之戰爭並非易事，德日兩國僅能在其本土上方可擊敗，惟如此則需要遠較目前更爲廣大之實力。渠於結論中謂美人欲在此次戰爭獲得勝利，必須　其全力以赴云。</p>
<p>羅馬二十九日中央社電　德國新聞社訊，羅馬無綫電台星期三日批　邱吉爾關於義大利之發言稱。邱吉爾在下院之　述，義人對之不以爲異，蓋義人早巳料知有此一　也。義英　國之關係並無任何變化，英人所稱彼等係　法西斯主義作戰而非對義人民作戰，但英人現巳向世人顯示彼等乃欲殲滅義大利之人民而已。義人當然始終不信託英人，義人深知英人希望義大利發生內戰，以便有助於英人擊敗軸心之計劃。羅馬無綫電台續稱，義大利現正面對一殘忍之敵人，故惟有自由與光榮而作戰爲其唯一之選擇。</p>

<p>陳市長昨向報界發表之重要談話中說：「統制物價工作，當局現正計劃採取更强硬之措置，並實施更嚴續之罰則：此種辦法，不獨在市府轄境內付諸實施，抑且在交還以後之兩租界區域內，亦當實行」。同時，三市區當局業經　每宣示，嚴厲警告任何方面不得擅自提高物價，否則立即控究。</p>
<p>這一段談話與這一張佈告，在原則上，完全符合昨日本攔所論「法律上的適當措置，乃爲達到穩定物價步驟的　石」。</p>
<p>在收囘租界的歡樂聲中，經濟界中「任何人士，商行，合夥，公司，會社等等」，還須記取「樂極生悲」的一句古話，事事留神，處處順忌，千萬不要以爲收囘租界以後的空氣是自由的，以爲任意提高物價也是自由的；須知善性的自由，自有法律來保障，惡性的自由，也有法律來制裁。到了法律來制裁的時候，則雖有黃金在握，亦不得不以座上客變作階下囚了！因爲，在戰時安定民生的一個要求下，投機居奇，祇顧個人享受，不顧大衆生活者，便是國家社會的罪人。</p>

<h3 id="c51">貧和富 <a href="#c51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— 石麟</p>
<p>不要炫耀當，也不要　視窮，須知眞正的貧和富是表現在每個人的性格上底的。</p>
<p>一個百萬富翁，假使成天計算着自己的錢財數目，企圖怎樣怎樣使它增大，那末，徒使財產加大了幾倍，有了上萬萬的銀錢，也就仍脫不了一個「窮」，你能說，成天算計錢，希望它更多，更富，不是自覺他現有的財產的不夠？那末，這種「算」，不就是「窮」的表現？所以，這類人，無論他的錢如何富有，數目也不斷加大以致於無限大數，在精神上說，他們是無時不自覺自己「窮」，這是性格上的「窮」！</p>
<p>也有人，看他是措大，但，却很能安於自己現實的生活，「窮」不能改變他做人的宗旨，古時有簞食瓢欽不改其樂的顏囘，雖「窮」，而能不改其樂，其夭賦的富有的可貴，當非百萬富翁輩所能共論，他的思念中旣無「貧」和「富」，則「貧」「富」就決不能移動他半點的意志，如此，能保持自已的信仰，哲理，和自由的思境，終生不變錢財不能綑綁住他，貧窮不能移動他，你又焉能不承認他天生的富有，這種性格上的「富」，才是眞「富」？</p>

<h3 id="c54">關於節約運動的　一點意見 <a href="#c54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— 千里</p>
<p>「哀莫大於心死」，眞是一句一針見血的話。我們看一看，當前一般社會的生活心理，已經到了怎樣一個地步？生活難，不錯，是事實；但，只要「難」得普遍，「難」得平均，那末，縱使再「難」一點，只要大家都能夠在吃苦受難當中，認淸自己的環境，抱定奮鬥的目標，以精神的力量來克制物質的慾望，「生死以之」的幹下去，倒也朱始不是復興國族的一種鞭策。然而，事實與理想，剛剛站在極矛盾的兩端。</p>
<p>在生活難的一片呼聲當中，淸淸楚楚，刻劃着一條天差地懸的鴻講　一面是成千成萬的大衆，做了餓莩，做了路屍；另外一面是得天獨厚（？）的傢伙，肉林酒池，笙默絃　。一面是一天到晚在「不得了」的呼喊當中嘆苦；另一面是隨時隨地　「了不得」的神氣當中擺闊。這是一個什麼現象！這是一個多麼嚴重的社會間題！</p>
<p>但社會上終究還存在着一部份有良心的熱血人士，就在這種舉世滔滔的「四不像」的局面當中，爆發了一顆「不忍」的心理——在驕奢淫佚的環境裏，來提倡節約運動，實實在在，倒是一種「負責任，說老實話」的行動。一這裏來一談節約運　成敗的關鍵：</p>
<p>第一，我們中國的「運動」要比任何國家來得多；相反的，「運動」雖多，成效很少。換句話說，任何「運動」的效果，不容易看　；任何「運動」的理論，却應有盡有。因此，我們希望這一次倡導的節約運動，非得要「運動」到有了實際的效果，決不鬆弛。</p>
<p>第二，在今日的中國，節約運動，雖然是一個對症下藥的辦法；不過，在推行這一運動的當口，最好特別注意到「運動」的「對象」。申言之，就是原本在「不得了」的生活環境中的大多數的老百姓，如果再去叫它們要厲行節約，似乎是多此一舉了；而對於一般還是許「了不得」的神氣當中處處要擺闊的傢伙，才是應該特別「釘住」它們，特別「感動」它們。</p>
<p>第三，節約運動，如果僅僅是一種普通的運動而已，那未，無非是徒然嘮嘮叨叨一大堆，結果是跌入「兜了一個圈子什麼都沒有得到的窠臼。」我們要倡導節的運動，我們應該用些什麼方法，在實際上去找效果？才算得沒有白做。</p>
<p>第四，驕奢淫佚的風氣，雖說是根深蒂固；但，移風易俗，並不是眞的比登天還要難的事。曾文正公說得好：「風俗之厚　奚恃乎。恃乎一二人之所嚮而已。」所謂「一二人」決不是拉車子的小三子，也不會是三家村的老學究，無疑的是一般政治上的管理者。所以，節約運動的推行，最好先去求求那般在上者，能夠在救救國家，救救東亞的立塲上，個個人說得到，做得到的在自己的生活上，厲行節約，由是而造成二種風氣，由是而把節約下來的物力，貢獻於國家，百獻於東亞。</p>
<p>第五，我們不要光是在「衣食住行應該怎樣怎樣才算節約」這一問題上做文章，我們必須在「萬一發現了一般故意不節約的傢伙，可有什麼方法，使它不敢不節約」的問題上，想想辦法。雖說衣食住行，什麼人都有自由權，有了錢不准買東西，有了錢不准吃東西，豈不是在開玩笑，但　我們要記住：在爭取大東亞戰爭最後勝利的現階段中，別人家吃苦受難的程度，我們有沒有跟得上？而且要貢獻一切力量於大東亞戰爭，有沒有剩除下來的物力，給我們私人享受上的消耗　浪費？我們應該以對付敵人的方法，去制裁　般暴殄天物·害國家，害東亞的昧良之徒！</p>
<p>總而言之，人人能夠實行節約的力量，比一切動聽的口號。固然來得實際：就是較之　力於自己崗位上的工作，也不見得會差到那裏。在這裏，我們虔誠的希望於提倡這個節的　動的有良心的　血人士，要再接再厲的「運動」下去，要把已經規定的幾條節約運動的口號標語，從闡發理論當中，求取實際的效果！</p>

<p>申報與新聞報辦理助學金成績要然，報端所載捐款者的大名，凡是數目比較大的，大都是社會上工商界的名人，這是很値得注意的一件事，因爲人們總以爲「爲富不仁」的人多，現在在這件事上就可以根本打破了這個傳統的觀念了。但是我們知道，助學金當然是多多益善，多一份學金，就多救了一個失學的靑年，因此我們還希望上海的近來營業蒸蒸日上的工商界股富階級再熱烈的來捐助，做商人的取之社會者千，還之社會者一，原是輕而易舉的事，何况助學是一種最有意義的善舉，我希望工商界人士大家努力競爭捐叻，不要讓別人專　於前。</p>

<h3 id="e1">We Must Create a Mirror <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, we discussed Japan's Fourth Central Cooperation Conference, which gathered representatives from various sectors to discuss plans for national prosperity and the people's welfare. Whenever there were criticisms of the government's policies, government officials immediately explained the reasons. For any proposals decided upon through discussion, government officials promptly expressed their sincere acceptance. In this way, the people's opinions had ample opportunity for expression, and the government showed genuine sincerity in accepting them. This is the key to the government and the people becoming one, generating a cohesive force. Therefore, we suggest that we should treat this type of Japanese conference as a mirror, examining it closely to identify all the blemishes, which must then be thoroughly cleansed and corrected. However, unfortunately, this mirror is not ours. If we merely copy the blemishes it reveals and the cleansing and corrective methods it uses, the blemishes may not be entirely the same, and the cleansing methods may not be entirely appropriate or suitable. Therefore, to accurately identify our own blemishes and to adopt more appropriate cleansing methods, we need to create our own mirror, and this mirror must be smooth, accurate, and free from distortion.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the blemishes revealed by this accurate mirror will undoubtedly be numerous. Some will be superficial dirt, some will be sticky grease, and some will be deep-seated ink. Therefore, the cleansing methods must be adapted accordingly, using towels, soap, or brushes, either individually or in combination. Once we know the types and locations of the blemishes and have the cleansing methods, the final and most important step is to diligently and faithfully apply the methods to the cleansing process. If we use the wrong methods, the surface blemishes may be removed, but the marks will remain unclear. If we misidentify the locations, the stains will not be cleansed, and the skin may be damaged. These are all things that must be carefully executed during the cleansing process.</p>
<p>Based on the above statements, we can divide the process into four steps: first, creating an accurate mirror; second, thoroughly examining all the blemishes; third, identifying the types of blemishes and determining appropriate cleansing methods; and fourth, following the cleansing methods, accurately identifying the locations of the blemishes, and diligently and meticulously cleansing them. These four steps are interconnected and mutually dependent; none can be omitted or neglected. Only through constant and tireless effort can we cleanse the blemishes and restore a fresh appearance.</p>
<p>What we have said may seem too abstract. But that is not the case. We must first present this matter metaphorically, so that everyone has an impression and an outline in their minds, and then everyone will realize the importance and necessity of this matter.</p>
<p>We ask again, if we have blemishes on our face, do we need to wash them away immediately? The answer must be unanimously "Absolutely yes!" Then, let us do our utmost to promote the realization of this matter!</p>
<p>But how exactly is this mirror constructed? How do we examine the blemishes? How do we determine the cleansing methods? How do we carry out the cleansing? First, the mirror is the public opinion institution, the institution for the people to participate in politics and express their opinions. It is an institution composed of representatives purely elected by the people from various regions and sectors. Second, examining the blemishes means that, during gatherings, the people's representatives each present the people's hardships and the ills of the political and economic situation. Third, determining the cleansing methods means that the people's representatives exchange opinions, discuss, and create proposals based on their own experiences and views. Fourth, carrying out the cleansing means that the government authorities sincerely accept the proposals made by the public opinion institutions, issue directives to all levels and responsible agencies for their effective implementation, and at the same time, the people's representatives return to their respective areas and fully explain the content and significance of the proposals to the people they represent, so that the public understands and assists the government in implementing them.</p>
<p>The nature of this type of public opinion institution is similar to the Central Cooperation Conference convened by the Japanese Imperial Rule Assistance Association, which we have been introducing in recent days. Therefore, it can be said that the Japanese Imperial Rule Assistance Association and the Central Cooperation Conference are the mirror created by Japan to see its own blemishes. Japanese local representatives attending the Central Cooperation Conference is like using the mirror to carefully see the blemishes on the face. The Japanese people's representatives exchanging opinions and deciding on suggestions is like the method of cleaning the blemishes. The attendance reports of Japanese government officials and the declaration of acceptance of suggestions and the earnest implementation of suggestions is the effort to implement the cleansing. Under this step-by-step, top-down, integrated effort, the blemishes can certainly be removed, the face can be cleaned, and at the same time, more attention can be paid to nutrition at any time, and it is not difficult to have a renewed appearance.</p>
<p>Our country's current political and economic situation, and the people's living conditions, we must not hide it, are much more fragile and difficult than Japan's. That is, there are more blemishes on the face. Then, those with fewer blemishes on their faces still find it ugly and create mirrors to compare at any time and wash at any place. How can we, with more blemishes on our faces, be willing to be ugly and not know how to make mirrors to compare and even wash? Here, we should solemnly point out that the Japanese government's having a mirror to examine blemishes is not their stupidity, nor is it meddling. But our government's lack of a mirror is not our intelligence, nor is it saving trouble, let alone the absence of blemishes, but rather that our government authorities have not paid enough attention to this, or even if they can pay attention to it, they have too many concerns and have not been able to create it. This is a great regret in the government's and the people's inability to achieve a cohesive force.</p>
<p>At this time when the international situation is gradually moving towards a decisive stage, and the victory of the Greater East Asia War is still to be striven for, our responsibility is very arduous, and our future status depends entirely on our efforts, so we feel even more the need to concentrate our efforts with one heart and mind. We have always believed that a purely public opinion institution is sufficient to communicate and reconcile the opinions and forces between the government and the people, and its rapid establishment is even more necessary today.</p>

<h3 id="e2">Caring for Citizens, Widely Soliciting Public Opinion: Chairman Wang Inspects Shanghai, Hoping for Joint Efforts to Build a New Shanghai; Propaganda Department Explains the Significance of Returning Concessions <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency) — To inspect the general situation of Shanghai, the Supreme Leader, Chairman Wang, braved the summer heat and flew to Shanghai by plane at 4:15 PM on the 29th. Around 3 PM, various heads of institutions, including Xu Suzhong, Chen Qun, Li Shengwu, Gu Baohuan, Bao Wenyue, Ye Peng, Ren Yuandao, and the Japanese Naval Advisor Teraoka, as well as the Manchurian Ambassador Lu Ronghuan, arrived at the airport to see him off. At 3:50 PM, the Supreme Leader, Chairman Wang, arrived in white National礼服, and amidst the respectful farewells of Chinese and foreign officials, boarded the plane along with the Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, Chen Chunpu; the Minister of Construction, Chen Junhui; the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Zhou Longxiang; and Military Commissioner Chen Changzu. Allied General Chayama also flew to Shanghai on the same plane. The military music was melodious, and the atmosphere was extremely warm. At 4 PM, the engine started, and the plane gradually ascended. Soon, the silver-grey Sea Gull special plane flew eastwards over the Purple Mountain Range.</p>
<p>Shanghai (Central News Agency) — This time, the National Government's recovery of the Shanghai concessions broke the shackles imposed on the nation and people by Anglo-American imperialism for a century, and realized the late Founding Father's will to "abolish unequal treaties" and "seek freedom and equality for China," causing great joy to the people. The Chairman is deeply concerned about the five million people who have long suffered under the oppression and exploitation of Anglo-American imperialism, and has particularly high expectations for Shanghai after the restoration of sovereignty. Yesterday afternoon at 5 PM, he arrived in Shanghai as the head of state to inspect, listen to local reports, solicit opinions from officials and civilians, and give guidance on future efforts. The heads of various institutions in Shanghai, having heard the news, gathered at the municipal government at 3 PM yesterday to prepare to welcome him and departed at 4 PM. Those who went to the airport to greet him in person included Mayor Chen Gongbo, Minister Zhou Fohai, Minister Lin Bosheng, Minister Chu Minyi, Minister Gong Mochun, Minister Mei Siping, Minister Luo Junqiang, Governor Li Shiqun, Secretary-General Zhao Shuyong, Su Chengde, Cen Deguang, Ma Xiaotian, Dai Yingfu, Liu Yangshan, Wu Guanxi, and over a hundred other officials, including heads of institutions from allied nations. At 5:10 PM, the Chairman's plane arrived in Shanghai airspace. All the welcoming officials lined up at the airport. At 5:20 PM, the plane landed safely at the airport, and Mayor Chen went to the door of the plane to welcome him. The Chairman, wearing a new National禮服 and looking radiant, smiled and greeted the welcomers. Accompanying him were Secretary-General Chen Chunpu, Minister Chen Junhui, and Vice Minister Zhou Longxiang. After leaving the airport, the Chairman rode in his car through the two concessions and went straight to the official residence to rest. The people of the two Shanghai concessions, hearing that the Chairman had arrived in Shanghai, were overjoyed. All the bustling roads were filled with welcome banners, and the atmosphere was exceptionally warm.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency) — The Propaganda Department announced that Chairman Wang left Nanjing today and arrived in Shanghai.</p>
<p>On the 30th of last month, when our ally Japan and our country agreed on August 1st as the date for the implementation of the return of the Shanghai International Settlement, the Chairman issued a statement,</p>
<p>informing the people of the country: (1) "We must exert our enthusiasm and do our best to make the Shanghai International Settlement even more stable and prosperous"; (2) "We must especially cleanse the Shanghai International Settlement of the toxins that have been steeped in it by Britain and the United States for a century, both spiritually and materially"; (3) "This base of Anglo-American imperialism should be transformed into a gateway for China's independence and autonomy, a connecting belt for the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and further, a transportation hub for world peace"; (4) "After the return of the Shanghai International Settlement, there will be many things that require the cooperation of the government and the people. We must take on everything with a progressive spirit, in order to fulfill the late Founding Father's will to abolish unequal treaties, to live up to the great kindness of our ally Japan, and to meet the fervent expectations of the people of the whole country"; (5) "We also deeply hope that other related countries will follow the example of our ally Japan and quickly imitate the return of the Shanghai International Settlement"; (6) "We will make our best efforts to negotiate with France, and ensure that the return of the Shanghai French Concession is realized no later than August 1st of this year." After a month of efforts and the good offices of our allies, Italy has agreed with our country to simultaneously return the administrative power of the Shanghai International Settlement, and the recovery of the French Concession will also be implemented as scheduled on the 30th of this month.</p>
<p>Shanghai, which has been plundered by Anglo-American imperialists for a century, has now been completely restored, and the work of recovering the concessions has been successfully concluded. The late Founding Father's will to "abolish unequal treaties" and "seek freedom and equality for China" has now been realized. This is certainly due to the hard struggle of the people of the whole country for many years, and it is also due to the Great East Asia War eliminating the Anglo-American forces of aggression in East Asia, the peace movement, following the Founding Father's advocacy of national revolution to save China and protect East Asia, and our country's participation in the war, following our allies, uniting with the East Asian nations, sharing life and death, and our allies truly fulfilling their intention to help our country achieve independence and autonomy, so that our country can engage in recovery after its devastation, in order to share the rights and responsibilities as a member of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere for independence and autonomy. Chairman Wang is deeply concerned about the five million people who have long been exploited by Anglo-American imperialism, has very high expectations for the future of Shanghai, and is deeply concerned about sweeping away the remaining poison of Anglo-American imperialism and promoting friendship and cooperation between China and Japan in order to complete the war and lead the East Asian nations to coexistence and co-prosperity. This time, he will listen to local reports, solicit opinions from officials and civilians, and give guidance on future efforts, hoping that the government and the people will work together to launch a great movement to build a new Shanghai, in order to contribute to the construction of a new China and a new East Asia, and ensure that Shanghai becomes a gateway for China's independence and autonomy, and China becomes an independent and autonomous country in the East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere. This is the first time that the head of state has come to Shanghai as the head of state, which is a concrete symbol of the integrity of territorial sovereignty. Not only are the five million citizens of Shanghai excited and inspired, but the people of the whole country are also deeply rejoicing.

<h3 id="e4">Director Hori of the Japanese Information Bureau Speaks to Chinese Reporters: After China Receives the Shanghai Concessions, the Anglo-American Stronghold in East Asia is Eliminated <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) — Director Hori III of the Japanese Information Bureau, when meeting with the Chinese reporters on the 28th, gave the following speech on China's recovery of the Shanghai International Settlement: For a century, China has been a victim of Anglo-American financial imperialism under unequal treaties. The Shanghai International Settlement is truly a symbol of Anglo-American aggression against China. Using this as a base, Anglo-American forces have interfered with the entirety of China, becoming a major obstacle to China's revival. For decades, insightful Chinese have been fighting against Anglo-American financial imperialism day in and day out. The late Chinese Founding Father, Sun Yat-sen, died with this aspiration unfulfilled. However, the object of Anglo-American financial imperialism's aggression and the suffering from its heavy oppression are not limited to China alone, but extend to the entirety of East Asia. On December 8th, 1941, Japan resolutely rose up to return East Asia to the hands of East Asians and dealt a severe blow to Anglo-American strongholds in East Asia. In less than half a year, Anglo-American forces have been swept away from various parts of Greater East Asia, and the tide has now merely shifted to this side. Now, the Chinese National Government is about to recover the Shanghai International Settlement, the symbolic ground of Anglo-American aggression in China, on August 1st. This action is not only sufficient to demonstrate that China has broken free from the shackles of unequal treaties, but is also a symbol of the permanent elimination of Anglo-American financial imperialism in East Asia. Therefore, its significance is particularly profound. After the Shanghai International Settlement is recovered and contributed to the revival of China as part of the Greater Shanghai Municipality, it will be of great significance. However, it still requires greater efforts to make the main stronghold of Anglo-American aggression become the root of the revival of China. However, I am convinced that Chinese officials and civilians will be able to work together in the future with unwavering determination to achieve its complete development.</p>

<h3 id="e7">Completion of the Return of Factories in Central China: Japanese Authorities Issue Statement <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency) — After the Sino-Japanese Incident, there were 140 enemy-owned factories in Central China managed by the Japanese side. Most of them have been returned to the National Government by the Japanese side one after another. On the 28th, the ten factories in the Jiangsu area were returned to the National Government. By this point, all the enemy factories managed by the Japanese side in Central China have been returned. On this matter, the Japanese Embassy authorities specifically issued a statement that afternoon, stating that after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese Incident, the flames of war spread to Central China, and the property of Chinese citizens, such as factories and houses, was also destroyed or burned. However, the meaning of the Japanese army's war was to protect and manage these properties, repair the factories, and strive to operate them under various unfavorable conditions so that they would not be abandoned. In accordance with the policy of returning them to the National Government, they issued a statement to lift military management and implement the return of ten factories in the Jiangsu area based on the application of the property owners. After returning to Jiangshu area ten factories, 140 military managed factories have been completely returned. On the 28th, the final handover ceremony was held in Shanghai. After these factories were returned to China, those entrusted by the Japanese side to repair and operate the factories would bear considerable burdens and sacrifices. This is entirely a manifestation of Japan's hope for China's revival, and Chinese people related to this matter will also understand the sincerity of the Japanese army. We hope that after these factories are returned, they will strengthen China's current productivity, revive the economy of Central China, and cultivate combat power so that they can work together to complete the Greater East Asia War.</p>

<p>Chairman Wang's Speech to Japanese Reporters</p>
<h3 id="e10">Economic Cooperation Between the South Seas and China: Contributing to Solving the Overseas Chinese Problem and to Sino-Japanese Cooperation; Increasing Production to Remedy Material Shortages <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Ogata, chief editor of the Asahi Shimbun, inspected various regions in the South Seas for a month. On his way back to Japan, he passed through Nanjing and visited Chairman Wang at his official residence at 5 p.m. on the 20th, where he earnestly discussed his impressions and conclusions from his inspection of the South Seas and exchanged opinions. The talks centered on the China issue and the South Seas issue, and Chairman Wang made important hints about the connection between the solution of the China issue and the South Seas issue, which are extremely noteworthy. The main points of his speech are as follows:</p>
<p>The Issue of the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty</p>
<p>Prime Minister Tojo's statement on the solidarity of East Asian nations in the previous extraordinary session of the Diet was very meaningful. The Greater East Asia War is a war to defend Greater East Asia, so the solidarity of the one billion people of East Asia is inevitable. Among these one billion people in East Asia, China, Japan, and Manchukuo actually account for the vast majority, namely 550 million. Therefore, Prime Minister Tojo's statement to revise the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty has given the Chinese people great gratitude and confidence.</p>
<p>The main purpose of fundamentally revising the treaty lies in changing the guiding spirit of the treaty, that is, revising a part of the guiding principles of the treaty. The spirit of Sino-Japanese cooperation, which runs through the treaty, will naturally not be changed, but the environment has already changed, that is, the treaty was concluded three years ago, when the Greater East Asia War had not yet occurred, and the provisions of the treaty could not but take into account the relationship between Britain and the United States. However, today the power of Britain and the United States has been driven out of the Greater East Asia region, and the situation has already changed. Therefore, the revision of the treaty is actually due to the change in the environment.</p>
<p>Sino-Japanese Cooperation</p>
<p>We have said that we will live and die together, which is by no means diplomatic rhetoric, but our true spirit. The Greater East Asia War will naturally be won. If the war fails, then we will die together. The meaning of so-called living together is that if the war is won, then China can obtain rubber, gasoline, wheat, and all other materials from the South Seas. The South Seas and China can have mutual communication and economic cooperation. What is most important now is that the war has already become a long-term war, so China and Japan should have the spirit of comrades. In this long-term war, China and Japan stand completely on the same front and fight to the end.</p>
<p>The South Seas Issue</p>
<p>Since the war, the South Seas has become a Japanese-occupied territory. Today, it is impossible to exchange with third countries, so the situation of the overseas Chinese in the South Seas is completely unclear. However, although the overseas Chinese have many shortcomings, they also have the good qualities of East Asian people, such as diligence. The fact that they were able to establish their current position despite the oppression of the Dutch is entirely due to that virtue. Therefore, if these overseas Chinese can be properly guided and the overseas Chinese problem can be solved, it is believed that it will definitely make a great contribution to the development of the occupied territories.</p>
<p>The solution to the overseas Chinese problem is, in a sense, the key to solving the China problem and will make a major contribution to Sino-Japanese cooperation.</p>
<p>The Communist Problem</p>
<p>The recent opposition between the Chongqing regime and the Chinese Communist Party seems to be on a larger scale than before. The Soviet Union's dissolution of the Third International gave the Chongqing regime an excuse to suppress the Communists, but this point is not yet fully clear. Chongqing's diplomacy is roughly divided into pro-Soviet and pro-British and American factions, with the latter currently being more dominant. Therefore, the opposition between Chongqing and the Communist Party has intensified, but overall peace is not expected as a result. However, in my personal opinion, if the situation of conflict between Chongqing and the Communist Party develops and the conflict does not stop, then Britain and the United States will naturally be disappointed with this. Then Chongqing will also consider cooperating with Japan, which will be an opportunity for overall peace.</p>
<p>The Material Problem</p>
<p>This is not only a problem for the National Government, but also the most concerning problem for the entire population. The two phenomena of material shortages and currency inflation appear together, and it is necessary to find a way to solve them. If currency inflates but materials circulate, then unrest will not occur, so the solution to the problem should focus on increasing production. For example, looking at the problem of rice, the current peaceful areas are mostly consumer cities, while there are fewer production rural villages. The import of rice from the South Seas has also been cut off, so there is a serious shortage of rice. This can be solved by ensuring the security of peaceful areas and reorganizing rural villages. On the other hand, we should take the means of manufacturing industrial products, transporting them to the interior, and exchanging them for food from the interior. Next, in terms of cotton, the annual production before the incident was 15 million piculs, but last year it sharply decreased by about one-third, to only 5 million piculs. Moreover, only a portion of the cotton can be used by factories in Shanghai, because farmers hide the cotton and do not sell it. For example, now cotton yarn is about 30,000 yuan per picul. Although farmers sell their rice, they cannot buy cotton yarn and cotton cloth, so most of them spin and weave at home to be self-sufficient. This has a considerable impact on Shanghai's light industry. These are just a few examples. In short, there are many difficulties in the issue of prices, which must be overcome and resolved. Now the first step of the National Government is to make the people thoroughly understand that cooperating with the Greater East Asia War is the only way to survive after winning. The second step is to give the people strength and strive to prevent the depletion of the people's strength. This is China's problem, and it is also a common problem between China and Japan.

<p>Rome, 29th (Central News Agency dispatch): The Hai Tong News Agency reports that last night, Rome Radio commentator Massimo issued a statement saying that Italy is now fighting for freedom against Communism and the Anglo-Americans. The anti-Axis powers only attacked Mussolini in their broadcasts and news in the past, but now they have revealed their true colors and admitted that they are fighting against the Italian people. The Italians know the details based on their past experience, but the Anglo-Americans will also learn a lesson, the price of which will be very high, because they will know how the Italians can fight. Italy is now united in fighting for the people and the fatherland. The commentator continued that Italy does not need to wait for British Foreign Secretary Eden's proposed measures regarding the British and American treatment of Italy's overseas territories, and that the so-called Atlantic Charter will one day become a scrap of paper.</p>
<p>Sofia, 29th (Central News Agency dispatch): The new Italian Foreign Minister, Galli格利亚, made a short stop in Sofia yesterday while flying from Turkey to Italy. When talking to a reporter from the "Sola" newspaper, Galli氏 said, "Italy will continue to fight to defeat the common enemy of mankind."</p>
<p>Ankara, 29th (Central News Agency dispatch): Turkish Foreign Minister Menderes卓鲁 returned here from Istanbul, and was immediately received by Turkish President Ismet. It is reported that Menderes ended his vacation in Istanbul after meeting with the new Italian Foreign Minister, Baron Galli格利亚.</p>
<p>Relations Between Germany and Italy</p>
<p>Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency dispatch): Schmidt, director of the Information Department of the German Foreign Ministry, explained to international reporters on the 28th that the current Italian political change also affects the relationship between Germany and Italy. The gist is that the alliance between Germany and Italy is based on the personal friendship between Führer Hitler and 素里尼, which is a well-known fact. The alliance between Germany and Italy is formed by the close personal friendship between the two, and by the identity of the German National Socialist Revolution and the Fascist Revolution. Once this fact is recognized, it cannot be said that the fundamental relationship between the people of Germany and Italy has changed, because the survival of the people of Germany and Italy is the natural basis of the alliance between the two countries, and at the same time it is the basis for the common struggle against the Anglo-Americans and the Soviet Union. Unless the Anglo-Americans are subdued and the communist crisis in Europe is eliminated, the survival interests of the people of the two countries moving in the same direction cannot be guaranteed.</p>
<p>British and American Attitudes Toward Italy</p>
<p>Amsterdam, 29th (Central News Agency dispatch): London news: President Roosevelt said in a radio speech last night, when referring to the same issues discussed with Churchill in the lower house, that the anti-Axis countries' attitude toward Italy is not affected by the change of government, and still consistently demands its "unconditional surrender." When Roosevelt referred to the Soviet Union, he said that the United States is willing to be a sincere friend with it in the future world. Roosevelt generally said in his speech that future wars are not easy, and that Germany and Japan can only be defeated on their own soil, but this requires far greater strength than at present. He concluded by saying that if the Americans want to win this war, they must devote all their efforts.</p>
<p>Rome, 29th (Central News Agency dispatch): German News Agency reports that Rome Radio criticized Churchill's remarks about Italy on Wednesday, saying that the Italians did not find Churchill's statement in the lower house surprising, because the Italians had already expected this. There is no change in the relationship between Italy and Britain. The British claim that they are fighting against fascism and not against the Italian people, but the British have now shown the world that they want to annihilate the Italian people. The Italians will of course never trust the British. The Italians know that the British hope that a civil war will break out in Italy in order to help the British defeat the Axis plan. Rome Radio continued that Italy is now facing a brutal enemy, so fighting for freedom and glory is its only choice.</p>

These soldiers are fighting side by side with the people of Sicily, reviving the traditional heroism and spirit of sacrifice of the Italian army. After reviewing Italy's domestic and foreign situation and political and military situation, the Fascist Council declares that every Italian has a sacred duty to defend Italy's unity and independence at any sacrifice. The Council strongly affirms that in this critical period that will determine the fate of the nation, all Italians must have spiritual and material unity. The Council announces that in order to achieve this goal, all national functions must be immediately restored.

<h3 id="e43">Stronger Measures <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>In an important statement to the press yesterday, Mayor Chen said, "The authorities are currently planning to adopt stronger measures to control commodity prices and implement more stringent penalties. These measures will not only be implemented within the jurisdiction of the Municipal Government but also in the two concession areas after their recovery." At the same time, the authorities of the three municipal districts have already issued a solemn declaration, strictly warning against any unauthorized price increases, or face immediate prosecution.</p>
<p>This statement and this notice, in principle, completely conform to what this column argued yesterday: "Appropriate legal measures are the cornerstone for achieving price stabilization."</p>
<p>Amidst the joyful cheers of recovering the concessions, "any person, business, partnership, company, association, etc." in the economic sector must remember the old saying "excessive joy breeds sorrow," be careful in everything, and be cautious in every aspect. Do not think that the atmosphere after recovering the concessions is one of freedom, and that arbitrarily raising prices is also a freedom. Know that good freedom is protected by law, and malicious freedom is also punished by law. When the law comes to punish, even if you hold gold in your hands, you will have to transform from a guest of honor to a prisoner! Because, under the wartime demand for stabilizing people's livelihoods, speculators who only care about personal enjoyment and disregard the lives of the masses are criminals of the state and society.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Concentrated Distribution Plan for Bran Approved by the Executive Yuan <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>The National Commercial Control General Association, for the centralized purchase of wheat, has been urging local branches to handle the matter based on the established plan, under the supervision of the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee. The purchased wheat has already been transported to major regions for centralized processing. Flour mills will commence production in the near future. Approximately one million bags of wheat have already been transported into Shanghai. The Association believes that the bran from this wheat processing should be subject to a comprehensive plan for centralized distribution, in order to achieve balanced distribution and control consumption. Therefore, a temporary plan for centralized distribution of bran has been formulated, submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and record, and will be implemented immediately. In addition to being published in the newspapers, registration of bran inventory is also being carried out. The measures are as follows: (1) Flour mills in various regions should submit daily reports of bran production to the branch office of the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee, as stipulated by the Association. Any movement is absolutely prohibited from this date forward, and no further sales are permitted, except with the approval of the Association. The quantity of bran produced and the quantity moved out since July 1 must be reported. (2) Flour merchants in various regions are required to register all their existing bran inventory immediately. From the date of registration, the inventory is not allowed to be moved. For local daily needs, an application may be made to the local Flour and Wheat Professional Committee office for a temporary movement permit, with certification from the trade association.</p>

<p>Since the Material Investigation Committee began its activities to investigate materials, its work has become increasingly intense. A comprehensive investigation of the materials stored in warehouses throughout the city has been carried out. The investigation of the fifty warehouses in the French Concession is progressing gradually. In order to eradicate hoarding, it has also begun to conduct a second investigation into financial institutions' loans, based on the situation, to check whether there is hoarding behavior based on reviewing the loan accounts of financial institutions. At the same time, in order to strengthen the investigation work of the investigation team and achieve significant results, it is said that the talent of investigators will be enriched, and those with rich industrial and commercial experience will be hired to assist in the investigation work. It is also understood that recently, many people have secretly reported to the authorities the leaders of hoarding materials. It is believed that the investigation will be able to proceed more smoothly, and the evil trend of hoarding in Shanghai will be eliminated soon.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Measures to Ban Illegal Insurance, Six Measures Set <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Since the Insurance Supervision Bureau of the Ministry of Industry began registering and issuing licenses to insurance brokers on January 5th of this year, no fewer than six or seven hundred people have applied for registration in Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, and Suzhou. It is now understood that the deadline for insurance brokers currently engaged in business to apply for registration will be August 5th. In order to crack down on illegal brokers, the Bureau has formulated six measures as follows: (1) Starting from August 6th of this year, only registered and licensed insurance brokers will be allowed to introduce insurance business. If anyone introduces insurance business without registration and licensing, they shall be punished in accordance with Article 74 of the Insurance Law. (2) Insurance brokers who have already applied for registration before August 6th but have not yet received a certificate from the Ministry of Industry will be temporarily allowed to introduce insurance business. (3) Insurance brokers who apply for registration at the Bureau from August 6th onwards may not introduce insurance business until they have received a certificate from the Ministry of Industry. Violators will be dealt with in accordance with the first item. (4) Insurance brokers' associations in various places are preparing for organization separately. Before the articles of association and commission regulations are discussed, decided, and approved, the insurance industry will temporarily pay a commission of 20% of the actual premium received. Brokers shall not make extra demands. If there is any violation, they shall be punished in accordance with Article 13 of the Insurance Brokers and Notaries Registration Rules. (5) In addition to commissions, insurance companies shall absolutely not give brokers salaries, allowances, gifts, or any other similar remuneration. If there is any violation, in addition to the broker being treated as making unauthorized demands, the person in charge of the insurance company shall be punished in accordance with Article 76, Paragraph 1 of the Insurance Law and shall be liable for damages. (6) Insurance brokers should pay attention to the provisions of Articles 8 to 13 of the Insurance Brokers and Notaries Registration Rules, and especially pay attention to the provisions of Article 9, that is, brokers may not concurrently serve as civil servants, or directors, supervisors, and staff of insurance companies.</p>

<p>Before the war, the supply of staple food in this city was handled by rice merchants who transported and purchased rice on their own. However, since the central government implemented control, all food has been allocated and distributed by the state. In order to have rice merchants cooperate in adjusting the supply of staple food, the Ministry of Food has stipulated that rice merchants transporting and selling rice must obtain a food rice procurement permit, which will be handled by the food bureaus in various places. Upon receiving the order, the Municipal Food Bureau has instructed all rice merchants to be informed. According to the application method for this procurement permit, rice merchants who are already registered in this city can carry a letter from the business and four photos of the procurement person when transporting and selling rice within the same district. They can apply for verification and issuance at the first group of the Food Allocation Department of the Bureau and can transport the rice freely. Those who transport and sell rice without this procurement permit will have the rice confiscated upon detection and will be severely punished to maintain food administration.</p>

<h3 id="e51">Poverty and Wealth <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Lin</p>
<p>Do not flaunt wealth, nor look down on poverty. One must know that true poverty and wealth are reflected in each person's character.</p>
<p>A millionaire who spends his days calculating his wealth, trying to figure out how to increase it, even if his property increases several times over, even if he has tens of millions of dollars, he is still nothing more than "poor." Can you say that constantly calculating money, hoping it will become more, richer, is not a subconscious recognition that his existing property is insufficient? Then, is not this "calculation" a manifestation of "poverty"? Therefore, this kind of person, no matter how rich his money is, no matter how the amount increases constantly to an infinitely large number, in spirit, they are constantly aware of their "poverty." This is "poverty" in character!</p>
<p>There are also people who, though they may seem insignificant, are content with their current lives. "Poverty" cannot change their principles. In ancient times, there was Yan Hui, who remained joyful despite having only a basket of food and a ladle of water. Although "poor," he was able to maintain his joy. The preciousness of his innate wealth cannot be discussed by millionaires. Since his thoughts contain neither "poverty" nor "wealth," then "poverty" and "wealth" can never move his will even slightly. Thus, he can maintain his faith, philosophy, and the free state of his mind throughout his life. Money cannot bind him, and poverty cannot move him. How can you not admit that he is innately wealthy? This kind of "wealth" in character is true "wealth."</p>

<p>— Bai You</p>
<p>The Sino-French Institute of Sinology in Beijing has been officially established for two years since its official establishment in October of the year before last. The first organization established by the Institute was the Folklore Research Association, which was later expanded to establish the Historical Language Group and the General Index Group.</p>
<p>The work of the Folklore Research Association: (1) Collecting folk deity statues, New Year pictures, and books from various places, and creating research cards with explanations. (2) Collecting papers on folklore from various domestic magazines. (3) Selecting materials related to customs from various daily newspapers, clipping and storing them. (4) Selecting major Western works researching Chinese folk superstitions, religions, and customs, creating indexes and research cards for easy reference. (5) Studying and explaining various aspects of Chinese folk customs and conducting thematic research, currently writing an article "A Study of the Five Sacrifices." (6) Selecting materials related to customs from local chronicles, copying and preserving them.</p>
<p>The purpose of the General Index (i.e., index) Group is to maintain close contact with the Folklore Research Association. Its work is to select ancient books rich in materials on Chinese religion, customs, and habits, and compile general indexes. Among them, "Lunheng General Index" and "Lushi Chunqiu General Index" have been published. Those still in preparation include "Huainanzi General Index," "Chunqiu Fanlu General Index," and "Customs General Index," etc. (Sales locations are the French Bookstore in the Beijing Hotel, Laixunge Bookstore in Liulichang, and its Shanghai branch.)</p>
<p>The Historical Language Group aims to study Yin Shang oracle bone script and Chinese language grammar, focusing on writing special topics. An article "The Discovery of Oracle Bone Script and Its Contribution" has been written. In addition, an article "The Chinese Determiner 'de'" and a book "On Chinese Grammar" have been completed. The group also plans to compile a French explanatory dictionary of oracle bone script.</p>
<p>The Institute holds four or five academic lectures and one or two exhibitions each year. The Institute also plans to publish a research journal next quarter. In addition, the "French Research" magazine, which was previously published by the Sino-French Cultural Foundation, has been merged into the Institute this year. The Institute also has a French evening class. The Institute's library has over 1,000 Western books and 7,000 Chinese books, focusing on Chinese folklore, linguistics, textual research, and other categories.</p>

<h3 id="e54">Some Opinions on the Conservation Movement <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— Qianli</p>
<p>"There is no greater sorrow than the death of the heart," truly a pointed statement. Let us examine the current state of the general social mentality. Life is difficult, indeed, that is a fact; however, as long as the "difficulty" is universal, and the "difficulty" is evenly distributed, then, even if it is a little more "difficult," as long as everyone can recognize their own environment in suffering and hardship, hold firmly to the goal of struggle, use the power of the spirit to overcome the desires of the material, and continue to work "with life and death at stake," it may not be a spur to the revival of the nation. However, reality and ideal stand at extremely contradictory ends.</p>
<p>Amidst the cries that life is difficult, there is a clearly delineated chasm, a world of difference. On one side are tens of thousands of people who have become starving corpses and roadside cadavers; on the other side are those lucky (?) fellows, indulging in feasts of meat and wine, amidst the sounds of pipes and strings. On one side, people lament their suffering in cries of "it's unbearable" all day long; on the other side, people show off their wealth in an air of "it's extraordinary" anytime and anywhere. What is this phenomenon! What a serious social problem!</p>
<p>But there is still a part of conscientious, passionate people in society who, in the midst of this globally turbulent "neither fish nor fowl" situation, have burst out with a sense of "unbearable" feeling—to advocate a conservation movement in an environment of extravagance and dissipation is, in fact, a truly "responsible and honest" action. Here, let's talk about the key to the success or failure of the conservation movement:</p>
<p>First, our Chinese "movements" are more numerous than those of any other country; conversely, although there are many "movements," there are few results. In other words, the effects of any "movement" are not easily seen; however, the theories of any "movement" are all-encompassing. Therefore, we hope that this conservation movement, once launched, must not be relaxed until it has achieved practical results.</p>
<p>Second, in today's China, the conservation movement, although a suitable remedy, should pay special attention to the "target" of the "movement" when implementing this movement. In other words, it seems superfluous to ask the majority of ordinary people who are already living in an "unbearable" environment to practice strict conservation; and it is the fellows who are still showing off their wealth everywhere in the air of "it's extraordinary" that should be specially "nailed down" and specially "moved."</p>
<p>Third, if the conservation movement is merely an ordinary movement, then it is nothing more than a lot of idle chatter, ultimately falling into "the rut of going around in circles and getting nothing." If we want to advocate the conservation movement, what methods should we use to find effects in practice? Only then can we be considered not to have worked in vain.</p>
<p>Fourth, although the atmosphere of extravagance and dissipation is deeply rooted, it is not really more difficult to change customs and habits than to climb to the sky. Zeng Wenzhenggong said it well: "What does a thick custom rely on? It relies on the direction of one or two people." The so-called "one or two people" are definitely not the coolies pulling carts, nor the old scholars in the three-family village, but undoubtedly the political administrators in general. Therefore, the promotion of the conservation movement is best to first ask those in power to be able to speak and do in their own lives on the stand of saving the country and saving East Asia, strictly practicing conservation, thereby creating a kind of atmosphere, thereby contributing the saved material resources to the country and to East Asia.</p>
<p>Fifth, we should not only make articles on the question of "how should clothing, food, housing, and transportation be considered conservation," we must think of ways on the question of "if we discover a general group of people who deliberately do not conserve, what methods can be used to make them dare not not conserve." Although everyone has the right to freedom in clothing, food, housing, and transportation, and it would be a joke to not allow people to buy things if they have money, or to not allow people to eat things if they have money, but we must remember: in the current stage of striving for the final victory of the Great East Asia War, have we kept up with the degree of suffering and hardship of other people? And to contribute all our strength to the Great East Asia War, is there any remaining material resources for us to consume and waste on private enjoyment? We should use the methods of dealing with the enemy to punish those who squander natural resources, harm the country, and harm East Asia!</p>
<p>In short, everyone being able to practice the power of conservation is more practical than all the nice-sounding slogans: it is not necessarily worse than working hard in one's own position. Here, we sincerely hope that the conscientious and passionate people who advocate this conservation movement will continue to "move" forward and extract practical results from the elaboration of the already established slogans and signs of the conservation movement!</p>

<h3 id="e55">Hoping that the Business Community Will Jointly Raise the Banner of Educational Aid <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Hailin</p>
<p>The results of the Shen Bao and Xinwen Bao in running the educational aid fund are significant. The names of the donors listed in the newspapers, especially those with larger amounts, are mostly famous people in the business community, which is very noteworthy, because people always think that there are more "rich and unkind" people. Now, this event can fundamentally break this traditional view. However, we know that the educational aid fund is certainly the more the better. One more scholarship saves one more out-of-school youth. Therefore, we also hope that the Shanghai business community and wealthy class, whose business has been booming recently, will enthusiastically donate more. It is easy for businessmen to take a thousand from society and return one to society, not to mention that educational aid is a most meaningful act of charity. I hope that people in the business community will work hard to compete for donations and not let others monopolize the lead.</p>
