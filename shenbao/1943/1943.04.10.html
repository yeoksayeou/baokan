<h3 id="c1">澈查囤積必須打破「重情不重法」 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>昨天我們申論「官商分野」，意有未盡。中國的人情，實在太復雜了，非有激底的變革，任何良法美制，其結果總是事倍功半。我們在當前爭取國家的獨立與自由，再不能因循泄沓下去了。</p>
<p>一如昨天所論，這一次政府澈查上海大規模囤積，是政府爲了安定民生的賢明的辦法。更具體的說，政府的決心澈查囤積，母寧說是一種手段，其目的應該不以懲罰幾個作奸犯科者即爲已足，而必須經此澈查所得的物齊，予以悉數沒收。政府沒收多量物資之後，可以運用抑平物價，安定民生，這個纔算政府澈查囤積的主要目的。</p>
<p>我們最衷誠的願望，一是政府貫澈主張；二是支持澈查大員的秉公澈查。本來這兩點，已是責任問題，縱使我們不說，也應當如此做的。第三是我們人民須洗心革面，澈底變革風氣。謹再申述如次：</p>
<p>第一，政府實施澈查囤積以至調整物價，首先需要全體人民遵守國家法令，並進而協助政府推行法令，這精神，這道理，原是現代公民所必具，所必解，無待贅述。惟在我們這重情不重法的社會，却有大大宣導提倡的必要。我們的物價問題，爲什麼演成這樣嚴重？主要的一點，就因爲我們的社會習慣，太鬆散，太隨便，致使國家的法令，成了具文。中國人具有寬仁的德性，具有自由的天性。寬仁之極，就成了縱容姑息；自由之極，就成了隨隨便便，馬馬虎虎。順着這兩種習性發展下去，則寬仁至無是無非；而自由到一盤散沙。這在平時已是建國振興之累，在緊張的戰時，就更增加無限的困難。現在政府決心取締囤積，自然要無寬無縱嚴格執行，而全國人民，更要自動守法，並自動的行法。政府頒布了多少經濟法令，社會差不多是漠不關心，居心作奸犯科者，固然不乏其人；而無意的漠視法令以致自陷非法而尙不自知的，那簡直就多不勝計。大都市裏，儘多富者縱慾無度，而貧者衣食無着，富者恬然享受，雖然可憎，而大家見怪不怪，不予以社會制裁，彼此不知有法，尤其可恥。我們向來的重情不說理，徇情而枉法的傳統道德，實在要不得了。這種傳統習慣，就是今天我們所食到的惡果。大家記着：我們一要講理，二要守法，社會上要有破除情面的作風，政府中更要有大義滅親的精神。移風易俗，共濟艱難，要自國民大家自動守法做起。</p>
<p>第二，奸商豪猾及一般發渾水財者，要自加檢束，而勿以身試法。政府這次提出澈查囤積，是下了大決心，爲了貫澈這大決心，已經明示「不問何人，特別治罪」。所以，處亂世，用重注，在今天更需要殺一儆百，古人說：「一路哭，不如一家哭」。嚴刑奸頑，所以儆惕有衆，保全多數。我們本仁人用心，警告奸商豪猾，速自收塲，殷鑑不遠。</p>
<p>第三，官吏勿再執法犯法，否則必獲奇殃。過去囤精投機　風盛一時的原因，是民惰商奸，官也貪汚，因爲人民不知積極守法，於是奸商得售狡技，不肖官吏，也得渾水摸魚。今後旣然明法嚴刑，民知戒而守法，商畏刑而懼法，則官也就不能玩法。因爲大家循規蹈矩，吃苦節約，官吏若再有假藉權勢之便，而貪贓枉法者，那必爲衆怒所不容，而身遭奇禍。我們舉兩個例子，以證「不平則鳴」之力。去年德國邀請土耳其新聞記者團訪問柏林，特准土記者食加倍的食物，在食堂中引起德國人民的不平，羣起干涉，害得政府招待員兩面道歉，一面向人民解釋是爲了優待外賓，一面請土記者團原諒，而畢竟將食物减半纔得解圍。又數年前日本爲節約物質，冬間禁人民烤火，一天平沼驥一郞氏鄰家失火，爲了救火搶物，平沼家裏搬出了幾簍炭，於是羣衆大譁，政府禁人民烤火，何以平沼家　有炭，後經警保殷殷勸慰，謂平沼年高怕寒，家中之炭，係其門生故舊所贈，懇請原諒。這些看來都是小事，也非官吏假藉權勢貪贓枉法的事，尚且衆怒難犯。這裏可以看出日德兩國的國民平素怎樣絕對遵從國法。他們的官吏自然也不敢爲非作歹了。所以，大家的生活都苦了，唯官吏獨肥，不特政府要嚴法以繩，百姓也必然不答應的。</p>
<p>最後一句話，如果這次政府具有決心的澈查大囤積案，不幸再落到重情不　法的傳統道德的圈子裏，而無聲無臭的結束，或是縱了大魚，捉了小魚，這樣的後果，我們不忍言，也不必言了。任重道遠，願各珍重。</p>

<p>問：同業公會整理完竣需要多少日子呢？其時期大約…</p>
<p>答：這視各業的情形而有不同。有的現在已經非常完備，有的則不能不重行組織。實業部的計劃，預定在四月底一切機構可以完成。</p>
<p>問：現在蘇、浙、皖與南京上海兩特別市，這五個區域的問題，暫告解決，至於與華北的關係，或與武漢廣東等地的關係，國內貿易的機構將怎樣整頓呢？</p>
<p>答：與廣東方面或漢口方面的貿易，因幣制已經一致，故頗爲簡單。其他各方面，雖因幣制的不動，而籌措種種方法，但將來終必在總制總會的整個計劃下調整國內貿易的機構。</p>
<p>問：還有　榮圈內的日本，滿洲，南洋方而呢？這貿易機構與日本的關係怎樣呢？</p>
<p>答：是的、對共榮圈，即所謂對外貿易，將來用中日合辦的形式，組織另一與總會總會不同的貿易公會（假定名稱）。由中日人合作辦理。</p>
<p>問：這預定在什麼時候呢？</p>
<p>答：四月底也可以實現。</p>
<p>問：其次，鑛工業方面，如重工業，輕工業部門等機構的整頓，會加以何等研究嗎？同業公會呢，還是協識會？</p>
<p>答：鑛業與輕工粱方面的統制，尚沒有包含於全國商業統制總會之中，但此方面的統制是很簡單地可以完成的，將來亦畢竟要另外加以統制的。反正原料與其製成品都可以用商業統制的方法，範圍很狹，所以統制也很易辦理的。如現在已經有工業聯合會成立了，又煤業聯合會和紡織業聯合會也已經成立，將來祗要加以强化就行了。</p>
<p>問：在此方面，增加生產的對策，似比整頓機構來得重要。工業關係上增加生產的對策，現在有何計劃呢？</p>
<p>答：增加生產可有二種想法：工業方面或農業方面的生產增加，用改良技術的方法使其自然的增加生產。同時，此次並從側面用商業統制的方法，不單謀增加工業的生產，並兼謀增加農業的生產。總之，因價格的調整，閒接可以促進生產的增加。</p>
<p>中間的榨取若完全澈除之後，確信直接間接都促進生產的增加。</p>
<p>問：在農業部面的生產上，例如農民回鄕問題，農地荒蕪，無人耕耘，而在都會中則浮浪者蝟集而困於生活。像這種從生產部面向消費部面的人的偏流問題，　似有調節的必要罷！</p>
<p>答：在農村中勞力並不十分缺乏。政府方面並沒有獎勵農民回鄉的意思，因爲　際上並無勞力不足的現象。即如最近，大部分荒地已經在開發中，在火車中可以見到，乘飛機更可以看到很多新開墾的土地。</p>
<p>問：農村金融亦是一個問題，如購買種子，農具，肥料等，即在開墾上亦需要各種資金，農村金融的改善與其對策如何？</p>
<p>答：那計劃已經完成，以上海的交通銀行爲中心，許多銀行已經組織了「農村融通資金銀行團」，決定了貸款農村的方針，調查亦已完畢，下月即可開始實旅了。</p>
<p>問：那時候利息恐將成爲相當的問題罷！從辦事處貸給於合作社的利率，大槪多少？</p>
<p>答：財政部現在爲了取締投機而採高利率政策。這是爲了防止投機，故儘可能的提高利息，使投機困難，故採這政策。今後物資統制完備之後，　機業自然趨於消滅，所以利息亦必漸漸遞减，遞减之後，方能貸給於農村方面。向農村方面的貸款，當然應有低利率的精神。</p>
<p>問：金融方面這樣貸出，但實際上農具，種子，或開墾等大部分與建設廳有關係，對於水利或農具的製造，想已有具體化的對策，請加說明。</p>
<p>答：兩方面現在都進行相當的計劃。農具方面，由前全國經濟委員會與日本方面的合作，在無錫已經成立了相當大規模的農具製造所，將來用非常低廉的價格，供給農具於農民。水利方面，現在建設部極力在各方面建立水利計劃。建設部長似主張迴避田舍的損害，促進此方面的計劃。</p>
<p>問：　日經濟合作的問題，因最近中日提携更加密切，而有全面進行狀態，關於此問題，請爲說明一下。</p>
<p>答，對於中日經濟合作，我是非常樂觀的。作爲實際問題有來，中國假令有所謂重工業，那麼，華方意見，大槪誰都希望與日方合作提携。至於輕工業方面，現在華方似應在原料的供給上努力。</p>
<p>問：工業方面，與日本在資本上合作；輕工業方面，中國供給原料而由日本經營。輕工業，中國希望讓自己經營。這點是什麼意思呢？</p>
<p>答：這是唯一的重心問題。重工業固然希望在資本上合作，但並不是說　資本合作不可。輕工業也並非排斥日方的參加，乃是說，輕工業方面，中國人可以自己經營的塲合，就讓中國人自己經營，現在這方面似沒有合作的必要。這是某部分的必要的施策上所應該如此的，決不是在原則上說合作的不好。現在情形，正是不能不採取重心主義的狀態。</p>
<p>問：一千餘件的英美敵產之中，有經濟關係的很多，中國方面將怎樣經營呢？</p>
<p>答：想籌得等到詳細的材料後再行具體研究。</p>
<p>問：在這中間，民族資本似不能不有相當的參入，同時對政府的財政收入，又將作何打算？例如，日本交還的公司，政府把這些股票完全出售於民間，使政府獲得一時的財政收人呢？還是政府繼續保有這些股份，把紅利收入來充裕政府的財政　敵產的經營，在這一點上作何打算呢？</p>
<p>答：關於這問題，當然任何人都在道樣想着，在財政的收入加以利用。但是目前政府似並未具體的計劃怎樣辦理，即財政部方面也尚未在此方面加以研究。</p>
<p>問題：第二次第三次將要　還的敵產中，經濟方面的預料一定很多。這問題是非常重要的財政上的問題，難道政府尚沒有想到這裏嗎？</p>
<p>答：就財政經濟問題的調整而言，中國政府，大使館方面，都已經根據公司的性質而完成了各種研究與準備。公司的性質不同，殊小能一槪而論，如處於兩極端而不能活動的公司，即沒有存在的必要。所以因會社的性質，內容而各有不同。兩方面都已擬就相當的提案，現在尚未能發表。</p>
<p>問：大約在何時可以實現呢？</p>
<p>答：能同時一次辦理，一個一個逐漸的解決。</p>
<p>問：高島總裁曾說：大部分交還於華方之後，大體屬於民生產業的則由華方自行經營。資金計劃，此次大槪亦將根據重心中義而投放資金。所以民生產業交還於華方之後，資金大槪將就地籌措。中國方面能否在常地供給這資金呢？關於交還　的民生產業，以及新近移管於國民政府的敵產，是否當作中國自身的金融呢？倘然返還爲民族資本之後，是否再投資於日本的國策會社方面呢？</p>
<p>答：民族資本的參加非常容易，決不困難。</p>
<p>問：其次，我們想詢問安定民生的物價問題。爲了安定民生，首先必須把生活必辦品比例分配，要實施比例分配制，必先調查人口，調查戶口。現在當事者因爲不知道每一家族中有多少人，所以很爲麻煩，爲了將來的配給統制，沒有根本的想到調查人口和整籍戶籍嗎？</p>
<p>答：雖沒有像日本那樣嚴密，但戶口調查目前大槪已經完成。例如各大都市已有市民證，良民證等，這在今後物資的比例配給，將可周密的實施。問：公定價格的問題，維持生活必需品的公定價格，大槪快要完成罷？譬如紙烟，能够照公定價格出售嗎？各地都一律嗎？必需品的米，皂燭，洋火，紙烟等，若照公定價格配給，是安定民生最好的方法。</p>
<p>答：第一步首先從極少數生活必需品開始實施公定制。</p>
<p>問：要維持公定價格，不能不實施配給。譬如像紙烟等現在　辦法如何？日本人的商店內，價廉，而中國人的商店內則價高，在便宜的地方隨便什麼時候同稱沒有，而有的地方則是價高的東西。像道種情形，紙烟的公定價格制可能嗎？</p>
<p>答：公定價格業已確立。但與實際市價距離過遠的公定價格，難以實行，這是一定的道理。所以要使公定價格自然地實行，這是第一要點，另一要點是確保物資。若不能够保有充足的物資，公定價格一定是徒然的。若注意到道二點，我想沒有辦不來的事。</p>
<p>問：日本爲了維持公定價格，故强化經濟警察，此地有這意思嗎？</p>
<p>答：這已由內政部在實行。目前第一班的經濟警察官四十名，正在訓練中，他忙的水準比一般警官高，在學識上，待遇上，也不能不比普通警官高。這種警察宜以後將繼續的加以訓練，大約最初的四十名，將在南京地方活動。</p>
<p>問：商品的投機，似由於遊資在作崇，這與財政部有關係，此方面的取締，似很寬大。</p>
<p>答：對此，財政部方面目前正在研究中。將來同業公會的機構完備的時候，這現象自然會消滅的。現在投機方面的貸放，不在同業公會之內而爲業外的投機家。將來同業公會的機構完備之後，同時實業部對銀行家將發嚴厲的命令，嚴禁貨放於業外的商人。這是勢所必然的趨勢。</p>
<p>問：金　業的同業公會，參加商業統制總會嗎？</p>
<p>答：參加的，商業統制總會本次的理事長，就是金融界的代表者唐壽民氏。金融統制與商業統制，今後將順利地同時進行。</p>
<p>問：中日間像上述這樣合作，使和平地區的生產及商業方面復興的經濟力非常旺盛。於是和非和平地區重慶比較起來，從經濟上看來，此地似佔優勢。政治方面，全面和平不能實現的狀態，因爲有意見的對立。但在經濟方面，這偉大的經濟力，似可穿過接敵地區而伸展到重慶地區。此方面的力的增大，可以說是經濟的全面和平之實現。關於此點—</p>
<p>答：對此問題，我相信必可成功。統制若能够順利進行，半年之後，和平地區內的民生可以安定，同時，可以誘致敵地區方面　民衆來歸。而且不僅和平地區的民生可以安定，若抓住了重慶地區的民心，則此次的事變我相信也就可以解決。因爲物資的交流，不僅僅是物資，即感情，思想也可藉此而互相交流。（翔：譯自三月二十九—三十一日西部朝日新聞）（完）</p>

<p>兒童是國族民族的源泉，亦即是國家未來的主人翁。兒童節的意義，在喚起社會人士重視兒童，注意兒童敎養及種種福利事業。過去歷屆兒童節，很少有實際工作的收穫。兒童節熱鬧過了，兒童問題便又置諸腦後。</p>
<p>本報社會服務處在今年兒童節一天，特邀請一向熱心兒童問題，及難童敎養團體的　際工作者，舉行座談會，以作我國第十二屆兒童節的紀念，並爲同是國家小主人的苦難兒童們造福。是日到會的除專門學者外，難童敎養團體方面，計有天主敎基督敎佛敎以及各慈善團體，實開難童敎養團體互助團結的先聲。希望今後彼此能永久合作，爲已收容及正待收容的難童們解決困難問題。</p>
<p>胡祖蔭博士：沒有從事過難童敎養的實察工作，僅以第三者立塲，就難童敎養團體的合作問題，分消極及積極兩方固　獻意見：（一）消極的合作：比如這次兒宜福利座談會的發起即是。以前工部局兒童保障科也曾有過類似的發起，一方面得以共同交換心得，另一方面得以共同研究一切困難問題。希望此種座談會，能經常畢行，且可輪流至各敎婪院開會，俾收相互觀摹之效。（二）積極的合作：上海難童敎養團體，最好能集中辦理，荀能做到，則可節省人力物力不少。不通這純屬理想，事實上恐難辦到。最近因給養不易，一般人主張將難童疏散移鄉，上海　　敎養團體能否　　一　，集中辦理。則食糧可由整個　　　養團體名義去請求，以最經濟之營養，供兒童最大的需要。此外，人力方面也可以節省。這給予整個難實敎養事業上，自然收更好的效果。</p>
<p>陳　士博士：難童敎養團體奧其　　都市，負生活之高歷，自以移鄕爲是。難童敎育，必須採用新敎法。經費應請政府補貼。平時須與敎育社會當局取得聯繫，分工合作，　牀架屋之孤兒院，應予合併，最要通力協作增進難敎效能。</p>

<p>國民政府因爲上海的投機猖獗，所以下一道命令，着財政部，實業部，上海由政府及全國商業統制總會的高級幹部秉公澈查，「凡經營投機買賣，操縱市價，擾亂市塲者，不間何人，均即呈報最高國防會議，決定特別治罪，其查獲之物資，悉數沒收」。</p>
<p>現在華中的最大經濟問題，就是物價的在漲，而其最大原因，在於囤積居奇，這是衆論一致的見解。現在國府毅然着手肅淸此弊，實爲合時宜的措置。</p>
<p>投機者也自有其道理來解釋物價騰貴的正當性，第一他們舉出了通貨彫脹，認爲通貨膨脹的地方，物價勢必趨於騰貴。可是道種見解，和事實完全相反。祇要看上次工部局發表的文告，以及最近財政部次長的聲明，他們都說得很明白，目下在華中的通貨，決不比從前舊法幣流通時期多。通貨除儲備券之外，即使有所謂信用通貨的擴大，然論者亦認爲並未有膨脹的性質。退一步說，即使認爲這也是一種理由，然而目前物價的騰漲，其增加的程度決不是正當的。</p>
<p>投機者的第二種根據，就是說生產减縮，物資缺乏。可是，在這一點上，事實也背反了他們的雄辯。華中的生產活動，大東亞戰爭爆發以還，確然不振，所以生產减縮是無可否認的，然而生產减縮後所引起的物資缺乏，決不是造成今日物價飛漲的原因。再想到龐大的存貨，那末存在華中或是上海的物資數量，近來並未减少。</p>
<p>物價狂漲的原因究竟在那裏呢？這可以說是在於通貨和物資的關係被人故意歪曲強解所造成的。目下存在華中的物資，如果以正常的數量，正常的方法來買賣，使其流通，那麼物價自會均衡了。可是因爲有投機份子的活動，阻碍了順利的運用。囤積！居奇！結果在現實上流通物資數量比了現實上存在的物資數量爲少，這種情形，刺激了一般的人心，所有的現金全都轉到了僅有物資上去。上述的惡劣的循環狀態，是華中物價呢形的最好例子。</p>
<p>糾正這種情勢的唯一辦法，就是上述的必須根絕投機買　。國府這次的措置，就是此目的。眞正的問題，不在於背誦明瞭的經濟理論，而在於如何根據此理論以實旅具體的經濟政策。我們在這裏敢率直的講一句，現在有一部份人士認爲作奸犯科做着阻碍華中經濟的囤積居奇，至少其大部份和構成國府的份子有若何關係存在。我們固然不希望其眞，可是無論如何，國府把這個問題順利的解決了，就可以達到經濟復興，把握民心的兩大目的。這是以萬分熱忱盼切企求的。（雲鵬譯自四月九日大陸新報）</p>

<p>華北華中間之匯兌結算方法，過去有軍票滙兌，特別圓匯兌及申滙三種併用，軍票匯兌用於日方匯款及煤斤，小麥粉，棉紗，棉布等特定物資交易決算特別圓匯兌用於其他一般物資交易之決算，申滙用於華方匯款及無滙兌進出口之決算，但自四月一日起實行停止發行軍稟新鈔，故上項結算方法，亦應予以根本改革，新結算方法如何？各方頗爲注目，關於此事，業經華中華北兩局協議之結果，暫時決定採用下列各項結算辦法，已自四月一日起實施云。</p>
<p>（一）原有之軍票匯兌，自四月一日起在原則上改爲中儲券匯兌，即以儲劵百元對　鈔十八圓之比率直接結算，過去用軍票匯兌之一般匯款，今後一律變爲中儲券滙兌，旅行者之交換，以改爲中儲券對聯銀劵之直接交換。又向用軍票匯兌進出之特定物資交易結算，今後在原則上改爲中儲券滙兌，但特定物資中之一部份物資，採用特別圓結算。</p>
<p>（二）一般物資交易之結算，照常爲特別圓，但特別圓之圓價，在過去進出有差別，售出爲十七圓，買進爲十八圓，今則完全劃一，自四月一日起進出一律十八圓，僅收千分之五之手續費。</p>
<p>（三）無滙兌交易之結算，照常使用申匯。</p>
<p>至於申匯，過去聯銀方面採取集中制，其公定圓價比率爲三十圓聯準鈔，對中儲劵百元，此項統制申匯雖有明確之規定，但目前華方銀行錢莊間之自由申匯（中儲券對聯準鈔之黑市）進出頗多，故完全取締此種自由申匯，事實上所不可能者，衆認自由申匯進出，今後亦將任其存在。（雲鵬：譯自四月九日大陸新報）</p>

<h3 id="c50">德国人的儉樸 <a href="#c50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>— 劍農</p>
<p>德國人的儉樸精神是可嘆異的！二十年來的臥薪嘗胆，已是有目共睹不必說了：自從這次戰爭爆發以來，更是羣策軍力，積極生產，凡可以多保存一分元氣，多拿出一分力量的，眞是無所不用其極。且看最近的一件事實吧：</p>
<p>據海通社電，德國現在連婦女的服裝也加以限制和規定了。原來德國經濟部紡織科科長飽艾爾博士，對於婦女的時髦服裝，有極大的反感。他發表聲明說：「我們現在所需要的，就是棉布，和適合於戰時經濟的剪裁。德國女人該習慣於穿着如同古斯巴達人那麼樸素的衣服。」………』更有風趣的，是博士緊接着說的：『男子應該勉勵在她們新的裝飾上，覺出她們是有「吸引人的力量」的。』——這，我以爲博士未免有點過分杞憂了吧……。——結果，從他發出這種聲明以後，德國的時裝公司將來只能出售合乎實用的式樣的衣服，在玻璃櫥窗內，也只能陳列國家規定的式樣。</p>
<p>反觀上海的情形怎麼樣？在這風和日麗柳綠桃紅的季節，恐怕早有無數的小姐太太正絞盡她們的腦汁，去計劃她們一九四三年的春裝，以爲爭奇鬥艷的預備吧？這不是我們男子的事情，且不要越俎代庖多管閒事：我們自己該抱什麼態度呢？我以爲在這絲縷不易物力維艱的時期，雖不必刻意效法古希臘大儒學派那種身披襤褸長袍而反傲然自得的玩世不恭的行逕，——他們敝屣尊榮，鄙夷社會上的禮敎，幾欲毀棄一切舒適生活的條件而復返太古淳樸的社會，所以採取乞丐的手杖和行囊以爲哲人的標誌。——可是儒門高足子路那種『衣敝緼袍與衣狐貉者立而不恥』的精神，却是必不可少的！然而或者有人以爲這是「狐狸吃酸葡萄」的聊以自慰，聊以解嘲的辦法…。</p>
<h3 id="c51">神经过敏 <a href="#c51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— 小麟</p>
<p>殺害自己一生成就的，「神經過敏」也是一個大仇敵。神經過敏的人，不論他在家庭中，學校中，社會中，他是永遠不得寗靜片刻的人，他不知道甚麼是「快樂」，甚麼是合羣生活的樂趣。</p>
<p>神經過敏在心理學上說起來是精神病態之一，他的自覺性　於搜　，　　了自尊心，遮蔽了自己的人格。一個神經過敏的人，在外來刺激尚未達到刺激　時，他早已不得安寗了，在他心思中，自己永遠是一個「衆矢之的」，不論他自已說什麼？做什麼？或别人在說什麼；做什麼，地便想像人人在批評自己，分析自己，甚至於在謾駡，侮辱，竊笑自己。</p>
<p>長此以往，我們便可以想到他永不會着手去做渴望，計劃好了的事，他好似覺得有千萬隻眼睛在嚴密地找尋自己的錯處，他更想，要是做成功了別人一定會妒忌，做不成呢？他更不敢去想像了………於是「一事無成」，於是「潦倒終身」。</p>
<p>如果我們仔細想一想，這種人實在太多了，因爲十個只退不進的懦夫，有九個是息神經過敏症的。</p>
<p>小而言之它可以毀滅有用的一生，大而言之，它會阻止社會的進展，要驅除它的方法，你不要把自己看得太重，也不要看得太輕，對於你自己身外的事要發生興趣，要過合羣生活，不要估低他人的人格……再下一個絕對的決心來管束自己過份靈敏的神經。常常給與別人同情心，能這樣做的，你就能得到眞正的自由，愉快地得到成就。</p>
<h3 id="c52">根 <a href="#c52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— 辛波</p>
<p>也許阿丑不　　　　的人，他就不從他們下來的磴道上走上去，稍稍偏西，沾着一條沒有水的石　，走了幾步，再向山頂去。大根隨着他。這樣，他們到達山頂時，就繞過了一個城隍廟，到了山正中的天齊廟。</p>
<p>這山上共有五六個廟，以差不多的距離，分踞在山頂上，山頂是長長地由東南　向西北的。三茅殿比較低些，其餘四個就差不多在同一個高度上。天齊廟的左右前，都有平地，因此作買賣的和遊玩的人都很多。廟裏的人委實箍擠，他們就沒有進去。</p>
<p>阿五貪婪地放眼四顧着。雖然他所見的一切，都是舊相識，但他在這一年一度的機會中，從不肯輕易放過。他和大根的注意點，各有不同。他還是看看南方的崇文鎭，這和在小靈山前看見的，又有些小同了，覺得牠格外低了些，狹了些，鎮南的唐家山，則格外近了些，好像一脚就可以跨過去的。眼光漸漸由遠而近，落到了山下的靈山灣。靈山灣眞有着很好的形勢，牠的後面便是長長的靈山，右面是靈山西端向南延展的支麓，左面就是靈山和小靈山的交界，龍虎門作成了牠的東方鎖鑰。牠遙遙地正對着崇文鎭，不過地勢比了崇文鎭高得多，地勢向南一步一步地低下去，要完全脫離了東西兩方面山崗的環抱，才是眞正的平地。</p>
<p>灣事疏疏落落有十幾份人家，有的三五家連着，有的一家單獨着，各按着最佳的地點分佈着。炊烟縷縷，和濕漉漉的霧混合着，雖然相去並不遠，看起來也不十分淸楚。因此，阿五竟找不出大根的家在那裏。（二十八）</p>
<h3 id="c53">「满江红」观后感 <a href="#c53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— 小窗</p>
<p>「滿江紅」的故事是一個秦淮河畔的歌女，愛上了一個窮畫家，窮畫家也愛他，那歌女爲了誤會這畫家愛上了別人，逼氣的同別一個人去戀愛同別人去結婚，那窮畫家因而懷疑她在金錢的支配下是只有毀滅的，後來明瞭一切都出於誤會後，已無法挽回了，那歌女爲了愛人而犧牲自己的生命，陪襯的同樣有一個秦淮河歌女，一個窮攝影師愛上她，並救助了她，可是愛情需要金錢的，她不能同他結婚，後來這窮攝影師成了名有了錢，他們是結婚了，其他有闊人先生們，窮藝術家們，以戀愛當把戲的，及醜惡的嬸娘——鴇母們，是相當熱閙的，我沒有看過原著，當也不明白改編後有什麼變動？</p>
<p>編戲據說是集體的，我正同意「滿江紅」讀後裏說疑惑這剧本是一個人手筆，它的藝術情調是很諧和統一的，有的地方該指出的，那「淸凉山」會面時的一幕，還小够强調，諷刺不够厲書，那歌女在西湖愛上了那油滑靑年萬載靑，是多餘的，會糢糊了那歌女的性格，我更不同情把銀行家萬有光成爲這樣的人物，是忠實而非忠實，是誠懇而非誠懇的性格，這種人根本不懂得什麼是愛，他祗知道慾的滿足，憑他金錢的力量去支配一個女人，在玩厭了這個後，可以再找一個女人的，還有那窮攝影師李太華仍與那另一個歌女小香結婚，對於整個戲演出最大的問題？愛情是不能勉强的，更不能投机取巧，小香应该是不能得到这样的结果，这是我的见解，總之這些是原著的缺乏意識，还留下來的錯誤，雖編劇技巧圓熟，仍掩飾不住了的。</p>
<p>導演也很能盡職，把三幕八塲，處置得一些也不紊亂，很淸楚明白的交待於觀衆。有的地方是可以看得出是很費過一番苦心，尤其最末的幾塲戲，是很不容易的，除非有豐富的經騐與修養才能這樣恰當處理。</p>
<p>演員中，藍蘭的戲最吃重，每塲都有戲，憑她的能力是很能够勝任的，把那個歌女演得十分逼眞，台詞的淸楚，老練的演技，十足能够把歌女描摹出來，這樣長的戲並且能一絲不苟，後起的演員們，是應該効法的，可惜她說在這戲後，尚觀衆告別了，希望這話不成事實，在這劇台是萬分需要像她那樣優秀演員，白沉演銀行家，很能表演戲中人的個性。海濤的孫氏演得很好，李宗善演小香還不錯，劉基的李太華很成功其他演員都很稱職。</p>
<p>「滿江紅」是取材於張恨水著的小說，所以在整個戲是缺乏純正意識，祗有淺近的表示，沒有深刻的人生意味，導演編劇演員都能在水準以上，偉大的佈景，燈光効果都很優美，假使完全爲消遣，那還値得一看的。</p>
<h3 id="c54">接受批評 <a href="#c54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— 流雲</p>
<p>缺點是每個人都有的，有了缺點，難免不遭人家的批評。</p>
<p>批評有善意和惡意之別，善意的是一種很好的敎訓或規勸。相反的，惡意的批評是中傷，是抹殺了自己人格，對別人的離間。我們應該用不同的態度去接受他。</p>
<p>大凡偷偷摸摸的論入是非，多長不忠實的批評，也就是誣蔑。中傷。這損人利己，惡劣的手段，說起來是多麼卑鄙呀！這種批評，我們儘可置之一笑，絲毫　伸辯價値，和恐懼的理由的。</p>
<p>反過來說，善意的批評不論是誰的，我們都應該毫無疑慮的接受下來。這在事業的成功學問的造就上，極關重要。</p>
<p>往往對於一個批評，我們不能直覺地分辨出他的善或惡意來。這，我們不妨接受人家的批評，而後用反省的方式來自我檢討。「有」便直認不諱，力求改正，「無」便處之泰然。這樣誣蔑也好，中傷也好，只是到方徒勞心神而已。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Thoroughly Investigating Hoarding Requires Breaking the "Emphasis on Sentiment over Law" <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, our editorial on "Separating Officials from Merchants" had points left unsaid. Chinese human relationships are truly too complex. Without radical reforms, any good laws and beautiful systems will always yield results that are half as effective as intended. We are now striving for national independence and freedom, and we can no longer afford to be dilatory and careless.</p>
<p>As discussed yesterday, this time the government's thorough investigation of large-scale hoarding in Shanghai is a wise measure taken by the government to stabilize people's livelihoods. To be more specific, the government's determination to thoroughly investigate hoarding can be said to be a means. Its purpose should not be limited to punishing a few evildoers. Instead, the goods obtained through this thorough investigation must be confiscated in full. After the government confiscates a large amount of materials, it can use them to suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihoods. This is the main purpose of the government's thorough investigation of hoarding.</p>
<p>Our most sincere wishes are: first, that the government consistently uphold its position; and second, that we support the investigating officials in conducting a fair and impartial investigation. Originally, these two points are already matters of responsibility, and even if we don't say them, they should be done. Third, our people must reform themselves and thoroughly change the atmosphere. I would like to reiterate as follows:</p>
<p>First, for the government to implement a thorough investigation of hoarding and even adjust prices, the first thing needed is for all people to abide by national laws and further assist the government in implementing laws. This spirit and this principle are inherently required and understood by modern citizens and need no further explanation. However, in our society that values sentiment over law, it is necessary to vigorously promote and advocate for it. Why has our price problem become so serious? The main point is that our social habits are too loose and too casual, causing national laws to become mere formalities. The Chinese people have the virtue of leniency and the nature of freedom. The extreme of leniency becomes indulgence and appeasement; the extreme of freedom becomes casual and careless. If these two habits continue to develop, leniency will become indiscrimination, and freedom will become disunity. This is already a burden on national construction and revitalization in peacetime, and in times of tense war, it will add infinite difficulties. Now that the government is determined to ban hoarding, it will naturally enforce it strictly without leniency or indulgence, and the people of the whole country must automatically abide by the law and automatically enforce the law. The government has promulgated many economic laws, but society is almost indifferent. There are certainly many people who deliberately commit crimes, but there are countless people who unintentionally disregard the law and fall into illegality without even realizing it. In big cities, many rich people indulge in unrestrained desires, while the poor have no food or clothing. The rich enjoy themselves without shame, which is hateful, but everyone is used to it and does not impose social sanctions. It is especially shameful that people do not know that there is law. Our traditional morality of valuing sentiment over reason and bending the law for the sake of personal relationships is really unacceptable. This traditional habit is the evil consequence we are suffering today. Everyone remember: we must emphasize reason and abide by the law. There must be a style of breaking through personal relationships in society, and there must be a spirit of upholding justice even at the expense of family in the government. To change customs and overcome difficulties together, we must start with the people automatically abiding by the law.</p>
<p>Second, unscrupulous merchants and those who make a fortune from troubled waters must restrain themselves and not test the law. The government has made a great determination to launch this thorough investigation of hoarding. In order to implement this great determination, it has clearly stated "no matter who it is, they will be punished severely." Therefore, in times of chaos, heavy penalties are used. Today, it is even more necessary to punish one as a warning to a hundred. The ancients said, "It is better for one family to cry than for the whole road to cry." Severe punishment of the wicked is to warn the public and protect the majority. We, with the intention of benevolence, warn unscrupulous merchants to quickly withdraw, as the lessons are not far away.</p>
<p>Third, officials must not break the law while enforcing it, otherwise they will suffer strange disasters. In the past, the reason why hoarding and speculation were so prevalent was that the people were lazy, the merchants were cunning, and the officials were corrupt. Because the people did not know how to actively abide by the law, unscrupulous merchants were able to sell their cunning skills, and unscrupulous officials were able to fish in troubled waters. Now that there are clear laws and severe penalties, the people will know to be cautious and abide by the law, and the merchants will fear the punishment and fear the law, so officials will not be able to play with the law. Because everyone is following the rules and regulations, eating frugally and saving money, if officials still abuse their power to embezzle and pervert the law, then they will inevitably be intolerable to public anger and suffer strange disasters. Let us give two examples to prove the power of "if there is injustice, there will be a cry for justice." Last year, Germany invited a group of Turkish journalists to visit Berlin and specially allowed the Turkish journalists to eat twice as much food. This caused discontent among the German people in the cafeteria, and they intervened collectively, causing the government receptionists to apologize on both sides. On the one hand, they explained to the people that it was to treat foreign guests favorably, and on the other hand, they asked the Turkish journalist group to forgive them, and finally reduced the food by half before they were able to resolve the situation. Also, a few years ago, in order to conserve materials, Japan banned people from heating fires in winter. One day, a fire broke out in the neighborhood of Heitaro Hiranuma. In order to rescue the fire and grab things, several baskets of charcoal were moved out of the Hiranuma's house. As a result, the crowd was in an uproar. The government banned people from heating fires, so why did the Hiranuma's have charcoal? Later, the police and security guards earnestly comforted them, saying that Hiranuma was old and afraid of the cold, and the charcoal in his house was given to him by his students and old friends. They asked for forgiveness. These may seem like small things, and they are not cases of officials abusing their power to embezzle and pervert the law, but public anger is still difficult to violate. From this, we can see how absolutely the people of Japan and Germany usually abide by national laws. Their officials naturally dare not do evil. Therefore, everyone's life is hard, only the officials are fat, not only will the government use strict laws to restrain them, but the people will certainly not agree.</p>
<p>In the end, if this time the government's determined investigation of large-scale hoarding unfortunately falls into the circle of traditional morality that values sentiment over law and ends silently, or lets go of big fish and catches small fish, we cannot bear to say and do not need to say the consequences. The task is heavy and the road is long, may everyone cherish it.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) Special Envoy Chen Gongbo of the Chinese visit to Japan began visiting former Special Envoys to China, Kiichiro Hiranuma, Hachiro Arita, and Ryutaro Nagai at 9 o'clock today. After returning to his residence for a short rest at 11:30, he and his entourage attended a luncheon hosted by Tsushima, President of the North China Development Company, at the Imperial Hotel.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) Special Envoy Chen Gongbo of the National Government's visit to Japan went to the Prime Minister's official residence at 5 p.m. on the 9th to hold talks with Prime Minister Tojo. The talks lasted about an hour and a half, followed by a welcome dinner hosted by the Prime Minister at 6:30.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) Japanese Prime Minister Tojo hosted a banquet at his official residence at 6:30 p.m. today to welcome Special Envoy Chen Gongbo and his entourage from the Republic of China.

<h3 id="e3">Prime Minister Tojo's Welcome Speech <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) Japanese Prime Minister Tojo delivered a welcome speech at the banquet for Special Envoy Chen's visit to Japan. The general idea is as follows:</p>
<p>"Although it has only been three years since the National Government returned to the capital, its development can be said to be rapid. On January 9th of this year, it resolutely declared war on Britain and the United States to eradicate the long-standing scourge of East Asia. This is completely in line with the Empire's belief in the co-prosperity of all nations and the construction of Greater East Asia. The Empire will work together with [China] in the completion of the Greater East Asia War, sharing weal and woe, and sharing life and death. When I visited the Republic of China last time, I witnessed the hopefulness of the Chinese people and their engagement in construction, and I was deeply moved. The rapid development of China is due to the tireless efforts of Chairman Wang and Minister Chen Gongbo. Here, I express my deepest respect. The Imperial Government sincerely prays for and strives to realize the sound development of China, and will spare no effort to assist. To achieve this goal, the Empire, on the occasion of the third anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital, returned the Imperial leased territories in China and recognized China's recovery of the administrative rights over the Beijing Embassy District and the Xiamen Public Concession. This is the first step the Empire can take to help China fulfill its expectations of abolishing unequal treaties. Other related countries have also followed suit with the Empire's measures. China's century-old grievances and various problems have gradually been resolved here. The joy of the 400 million Chinese people can be inferred, and the Empire also expresses its congratulations. In the future, we will do our best to cooperate and hope that all of you in China will manage this major global change well. At the same time as the establishment of the Greater East Asia New Order and the development of the new China, contribute to the construction of East Asia. I am convinced that Special Envoy Chen's visit this time will not only make the relations between China and Japan closer but will also greatly benefit the completion of the Greater East Asia War. Here, I hope that after Special Envoy Chen completes his mission and returns to his country, he will further cooperate with the Empire to achieve the common goal of defeating Britain and the United States and liberating East Asia."</p>
<p>Special Envoy Chen's Reply</p>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) Special Envoy Chen gave a reply at Prime Minister Tojo's welcoming banquet. The full text is as follows: "Minister of General Affairs, Honorable Ministers, Honorable Guests, today I am honored and grateful to visit your country on behalf of my government and to receive the Prime Minister's gracious hospitality. I recall with pleasure Prime Minister Tojo's visit to our country last month to reply to our Chairman, and it was a great pleasure to hear his insightful remarks. Today, I once again see his brilliant demeanor and hear his wise teachings, which further excite my heart. Your country's return of all exclusive Japanese concessions in China, recognition of China's recovery of the Shanghai Public Concession, the Xiamen Public Concession, and the Beijing Embassy District, the abolition of extraterritoriality and other favorable measures, and its efforts to support the construction of a new China, and in the future, in response to the development of the new relationship between China and Japan, it has also decided to reconsider various existing agreements in the same spirit, and, on the occasion of the third anniversary of the return of the National Government to the capital, it first implemented the return of exclusive concessions and cooperated in the return of the Beijing Embassy District and the Xiamen Public Concession. All these decisions are sufficient to show your country's determination to assist China's freedom and independence, liberate the nations of East Asia, and build a new order in East Asia. They are also sufficient to show that the Prime Minister has lofty ideals and great ambitions, and the courage and enthusiasm to reform the political era of the old world order. This is something that our country cannot express its heartfelt gratitude in words. This time I am visiting your country on behalf of my country to express our sincere thanks. Our country is honored to be able to follow your country in participating in the Greater East Asia War and to fulfill its due strength and responsibility. I know that our abilities are weak, but we are driven by the oppression of British and American imperialism for a century, the demands of justice and conscience, and the enthusiasm of your country to liberate the nations of East Asia, so we do not consider the weakness of our strength, but seek the peace of our conscience. In this Greater East Asia War, with your country's superior manpower and material resources, the foundation for certain victory has long been laid. The foundation of our nation lies in the spirit of eternal cooperation between China and Japan and the determination to share weal and woe and share life and death. I sincerely hope to follow your country and share the responsibilities that we should bear. Our country's determination is not limited to declaring war. We hope to contribute all our material and human resources to the Greater East Asia War as much as possible. We hope that your country will recognize our sincerity and give us close cooperation and vigorous support. I recall that three years ago, I was ordered to visit your country to return the courtesy, and I was hosted by former Prime Minister Rice. I once said, "I personally believe that China and Japan will have to jointly shoulder the great task of East Asia." I did not expect that today our country can truly follow your country in participating in the Greater East Asia War. This is not only the honor of the people of our country, but also the honor of myself. I hope that the Prime Minister and all the ministers will not hesitate to educate us so that China can follow your country and complete this epoch-making mission and task, then the people of our country will truly share in the honor."</p>

<h3 id="e5">Statement Issued After Arriving in Manchuria <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Xinjing, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) Special Envoy Zhou Fohai of the Republic of China to visit Manchuria issued a statement after arriving in Xinjing, stating that he had long wanted to visit your country, and he was very pleased to have his wish fulfilled at a time when the Greater East Asia War was making progress. The purpose of his visit this time was, first, to strengthen the relationship between China and Manchuria so that they could work together with their ally Japan to complete the victory of the Greater East Asia War, and second, to study the economic construction achievements of Manchuria over the past decade as a reference for the revitalization of China. The relationship between China and Manchuria has been based on the foundation of friendship between the two countries since the issuance of the joint declaration of China, Japan, and Manchuria. Last May, Chairman Wang of the National Government visited your country to promote the friendship between China and Manchuria. In June of the same year, Prime Minister Zhang Jinghui of your country visited China to reciprocate. The relationship between China and Manchuria has been further enhanced in friendship and closeness due to the mutual visits of the leaders of the two countries. On January 9th of this year, the National Government implemented a declaration of war against Britain and the United States. China and its ally Japan have moved from a connection of sharing weal and woe to a combination of sharing life and death. China and Manchuria must therefore cooperate more closely. The purpose of his visit this time was to respond to the new situation of China's participation in the war and to have sincere discussions with the dignitaries of your country on various issues in order to strengthen the cooperation between China and Manchuria and enhance the strength of cooperation between China, Japan, and Manchuria. The enhancement of this strength is the guarantee for winning the Greater East Asia War. The National Government deeply feels that its responsibilities are great and its tasks are arduous since it declared its participation in the war. Moreover, China's national strength and people's strength are both in decline, and it is deeply feared that its strength is insufficient. In order to be able to complete the purpose of the war, the National Government has made every effort to carry out various wartime facilities since its participation in the war. For example, in politics, it has reformed the administrative institutions of the central and local governments; in finance, it has adjusted bank lending to stabilize finance and suppress prices; in terms of material control, it has established a Material Control Review Committee and a National Commercial Control Association in order to ensure the smooth flow of goods and the full use of materials; in the military, it has reorganized the existing troops in order to enhance its strength; in terms of public security, it has strengthened the Qingxiang work, expanded the Qingxiang area, and successively held the National Local Officials Conference, the National Judicial Administration Conference, the New National Movement Promotion Conference, the National Economic Conference, the National Military Conference, the National Education Administration Conference, and the National Congress of the Chinese Nationalist Party. The above-mentioned work is all to establish a wartime system, enhance combat capabilities, and make a greater contribution to the Greater East Asia War. China and Manchuria are adjacent to each other, each with vast territories and abundant resources. If they can make every effort to develop and utilize them well, they can become pillars for stabilizing East Asia and prospering East Asia. They can also cooperate with allies to quickly complete the construction of the New East Asia. Your country has made every effort to develop and utilize the treasures of Manchuria for more than a decade, creating great and impressive economic construction. I am planning to take advantage of this visit to study the process and results of your country's economic construction, and I am also planning to have sincere talks with the government leaders, hoping to learn from your country's existing construction experience and achievements so that China's economic construction can be easily effective. If China's manpower is strong and its material resources are rich, if it can be used well and developed, not only can China's national strength be strengthened and the people can be enriched, but it can also make a great contribution to the construction of various friendly countries and the construction of Greater East Asia. China, Japan, and Manchuria must be firmly united to form the axis of East Asia, so that on the one hand, we can unite the countries and nations within the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere to form a strong East Asian group, and on the other hand, we can form a strong world group with Germany, Italy, and other European Axis allies. If this can be the case, not only can the forces of Britain and the United States be eliminated in East Asia, but also the rule policy of Britain and the United States can be shattered in the entire world situation. China and Manchuria are interdependent and have the same bloodline. We must be of one mind and one body, unite sincerely, and jointly complete the mission we should bear. This is my hope and the purpose of my visit to your country.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Japanese Army in China Releases Weekly Battle Report <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) The Japanese Dispatch Army in China released on April 9th that in the area north of Thaton, the Japanese army has since late December of last year surrounded and annihilated two divisions of the British Indian Army that were stirring up trouble, reaping great results. The enemy's propaganda has already mentioned the recapture of Burma. As a result of this operation by the Japanese army, it has been proven that the British Indian army's will to fight and combat power are extremely fragile. Moreover, the Chongqing side has not taken any action in Yunnan, exposing the shortcomings of the enemy's joint operations, confirming that Chongqing lacks weapons and ammunition, and is a specialist without any counter-offensive ability during the training period. Moreover, since late March, Japanese aircraft have learned that the US Air Force in China intends to carry out air strikes on the mainland, so they preemptively launched air strikes on Hengyang, Lingling, Lishui, Jian'ou, and other places on the 30th and 31st of this month. In the north of Lingling, an air battle occurred with 24 Chongqing D-40 type aircraft. It is estimated that four Chongqing aircraft were shot down, which shows that the Japanese Air Force has controlled the enemy's attempt to carry out air strikes on Japan and ensured air supremacy in Chongqing.</p>

Two-thirds of the island is covered by jungle. Only the south coast is densely populated. Before the war, there were more than 300 white residents, with the British Governor's Office, churches, hospitals, courts, customs offices, and other institutions. Sanitary facilities were also quite complete, making it a relatively popular island in the Solomon Islands.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina, 8th (Central News Agency dispatch) According to a dispatch from Washington, the US Navy Department announced that Japanese air force launched a large-scale fierce attack on the US military positions on Guadalcanal Island on the 7th and engaged in an air battle with the US air force.

<p>Rangoon, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) The Japanese army had previously launched annihilation battles in the Kaladan operation and Kyauksew, and the enemy has already admitted defeat. On March 18th, the Indian Anti-Axis Army issued a statement saying that the Japanese army's offensive on the east bank of the Mayu River in the Arakan front was still continuing. In order to prevent the troops north of Razabil from being isolated, the Anti-Axis Army felt it was necessary to reorganize the front line. Recently, in the dry area of the Kaladan River, the British detached force has joined forces with the main force. Furthermore, Reuters war correspondent Firot reported that the Japanese army is currently actively reinforcing its forces and is fiercely attacking the British army's front-line positions in the Kyauktaw area of the Kaladan River. Therefore, the British army outposts have retreated to the main force positions, and have withdrawn four miles northeast of the Kyauktaw area, reaching the Ahbaw Kunlapin area. The Japanese army's transportation line is extremely convenient. On the contrary, the British army's transportation lines are all mountainous areas. In the Mayu River area, the Japanese army bombarded the British army positions three miles away and, after occupying a certain high ground, is currently attempting to encircle the British army in the area north of Razabil.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) The Japanese Army Air Corps stationed in Burma, on the 6th, used a large formation of fighter-bombers to fiercely bomb the Akola airfield, about 200 kilometers northwest of Chittagong, reaping great results and returning safely to their original defenses.</p>

First, I express my gratitude to the Burmese people for overcoming various difficulties in wartime, enduring sacrifices, and cooperating with our defense forces.

<h3 id="e14">Fierce Battles in Southern and Central Tunisia, British Encirclement Plan Ultimately Unsuccessful <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a military correspondent for the Havas News Agency, fierce battles continue in southern and central Tunisia. The Anti-Axis forces are constantly reinforcing. The British Eighth Army has broken through the defenses held by Axis infantry, but a counter-attack by Axis armored forces failed to recover the situation. However, this German action was not without success, as it prevented the Axis forces in the Djebel Cans area west of El Guettar from being encircled. According to General Montgomery's plan, after this breakthrough, the British forces would use tank columns to advance north directly towards Maknassy, which has been the center of operations for the U.S. Fifth Army in recent weeks. If the British tank columns could realize this plan by the early morning of the third period (unclear meaning from original article) and make contact with the U.S. forces, the Axis forces in the Djebel Cans area would have their lines of communication cut off. Fortunately, a counter-attack by Marshal Rommel's tank forces prevented the success of this British plan. The Axis forces, in fierce fighting, obtained the opportunity to withdraw completely without being encircled. However, a portion of General Montgomery's motorized forces ultimately advanced westward along the northern edge of the road to Tozeur and made contact with the U.S. forces east of El Guettar. By this time, the Axis forces in the Djebel Cans area had completely withdrawn and were no longer threatened. Therefore, the British and U.S. forces met outside the Axis lines. At the same time, Marshal Rommel shifted his southern front line to a new position, using the hills east of Maknassy as the main base for his right flank. Details of the new Axis positions in the coastal area are not yet known. In the plains, which are gradually becoming the site of operations, the Anti-Axis forces should be able to fully exploit their numerical and equipment superiority, so the new Axis defensive lines may be under the greatest pressure. Further north in central Tunisia, fierce fighting may also occur. The Anti-Axis forces may once again attempt to strike towards the coast to cut off the Axis forces in southern Tunisia. After the first failed eastward offensive, the Anti-Axis forces may launch another eastward attack further north, generally advancing from the Pichon area towards Kairouan and Sousse. In the past few days, the left flank of the U.S. Fifth Army at Pichon has been greatly reinforced, and the elite British troops now appearing in the area seem to be intended to serve as the vanguard when the Anti-Axis forces launch an offensive in this area. This British unit seems to have been transferred from the British First Army front line in northern Tunisia. Even after transferring this unit, the British First Army still has sufficient strength to assist in an offensive with a large number of tanks in the Medjez el Bab area on Wednesday, but they were repulsed and heavily damaged by the Axis forces.</p>

<h3 id="e16">Wartime Economy and Sino-Japanese Cooperation: Minister of Industry Mei's Remarks to Japanese Reporters (2) <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Question: How long will it take to complete the reorganization of trade associations? Approximately when...?</p>
<p>Answer: It varies depending on the industry. Some are already very well-established, while others need to be reorganized. The Ministry of Industry plans to complete all the organizational structures by the end of April.</p>
<p>Question: The issues concerning the five regions of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and the two special municipalities of Nanjing and Shanghai have been temporarily resolved. As for the relationship with North China, or with Wuhan, Guangdong, and other places, how will the domestic trade structure be reorganized?</p>
<p>Answer: Trade with Guangdong or Hankou is relatively simple because the currency system is already unified. For other regions, although various methods are being devised due to the lack of currency unification, the domestic trade structure will ultimately be adjusted under the overall plan of the National Federation of Trade Associations.</p>
<p>Question: What about Japan, Manchuria, and Southeast Asia within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere? What is the relationship between this trade structure and Japan?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes, for the Co-Prosperity Sphere, that is, so-called foreign trade, we will organize another trade association (tentatively named) in the form of Sino-Japanese joint ventures, different from the National Federation of Trade Associations. It will be jointly managed by Chinese and Japanese personnel.</p>
<p>Question: When is this scheduled to happen?</p>
<p>Answer: It can also be realized by the end of April.</p>
<p>Question: Secondly, regarding the reorganization of institutions in the mining and industrial sectors, such as heavy industry and light industry departments, will any research be conducted? Trade associations or collaboration associations?</p>
<p>Answer: The control of mining and light industry is not yet included in the National Federation of Commercial Control Associations, but the control in this area can be completed very simply, and it will ultimately be subject to separate control. Anyway, raw materials and their finished products can be controlled by commercial control methods. The scope is narrow, so control is also easy to implement. For example, the Industrial Federation has already been established, and the Coal Industry Federation and the Textile Industry Federation have also been established. In the future, we only need to strengthen them.</p>
<p>Question: In this area, measures to increase production seem more important than reorganizing institutions. What plans are currently in place for measures to increase production in relation to industry?</p>
<p>Answer: There are two ways to think about increasing production: increasing production in the industrial or agricultural sector by improving technology to naturally increase production. At the same time, this time, we will use commercial control methods from the side, not only to increase industrial production, but also to increase agricultural production. In short, the adjustment of prices can indirectly promote the increase in production.</p>
<p>After the exploitation of middlemen is completely eliminated, it is believed that production will be promoted directly and indirectly.</p>
<p>Question: Regarding production in the agricultural sector, for example, the problem of farmers returning to their hometowns, abandoned farmland, and no one to cultivate it, while vagrants gather in cities and struggle to survive. It seems necessary to regulate this flow of people from the production sector to the consumption sector!</p>
<p>Answer: There is not a severe shortage of labor in rural areas. The government does not intend to encourage farmers to return to their hometowns because there is no shortage of labor in reality. For example, recently, most of the wasteland has already been under development. You can see it on the train, and you can see a lot of newly reclaimed land from the plane.</p>
<p>Question: Rural finance is also a problem, such as purchasing seeds, farm tools, fertilizers, etc., and various funds are needed for reclamation. How can rural finance be improved, and what are the countermeasures?</p>
<p>Answer: That plan has already been completed. With the Bank of Communications in Shanghai as the center, many banks have organized a "Rural Finance Bank Consortium," determined the policy of lending to rural areas, the investigation has also been completed, and it will be implemented next month.</p>
<p>Question: At that time, the interest rate may become a considerable problem! What is the approximate interest rate from the office to the cooperative?</p>
<p>Answer: The Ministry of Finance is currently adopting a high-interest rate policy to combat speculation. This is to prevent speculation, so we try to raise the interest rate as much as possible to make speculation difficult. After the control of materials is complete in the future, speculation will naturally disappear, so the interest rate will gradually decrease, and only after the decrease can loans be given to the rural sector. Loans to the rural sector should, of course, have a spirit of low interest rates.</p>
<p>Question: Financial institutions lend like this, but in reality, farm tools, seeds, or reclamation are mostly related to the Construction Department. It is thought that there are already concrete measures for water conservancy or the manufacturing of farm tools. Please explain.</p>
<p>Answer: Both sides are currently carrying out considerable plans. Regarding farm tools, the former National Economic Commission cooperated with Japan to establish a relatively large-scale farm tool manufacturing plant in Wuxi, which will supply farm tools to farmers at very low prices in the future. Regarding water conservancy, the Ministry of Construction is now working hard to establish water conservancy plans in various aspects. The Minister of Construction seems to advocate avoiding damage to rural areas and promoting plans in this area.</p>
<p>Question: The issue of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. Because Sino-Japanese cooperation has become closer recently, it is in a state of comprehensive progress. Regarding this issue, please explain.</p>
<p>Answer: I am very optimistic about Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. As a practical matter, if China has so-called heavy industry, then, in general, the Chinese side hopes to cooperate with Japan. As for light industry, it seems that the Chinese side should make efforts in the supply of raw materials.</p>
<p>Question: In the industrial sector, cooperate with Japan in terms of capital; in the light industry sector, China supplies raw materials and Japan operates it. China hopes to operate light industry itself. What does this mean?</p>
<p>Answer: This is the only core issue. Of course, we hope to cooperate in capital in the heavy industry sector, but it is not said that capital cooperation is not allowed. Light industry also does not exclude Japanese participation, but it means that if Chinese people can operate light industry themselves, let Chinese people operate it themselves. It seems that there is no need for cooperation in this area now. This is how it should be in certain necessary measures, and it is by no means saying that cooperation is bad in principle. The current situation is a state where we cannot but adopt the principle of emphasis.</p>
<p>Question: Among the more than a thousand cases of British and American enemy property, many are economically related. How will China operate them?</p>
<p>Answer: I plan to obtain detailed materials and then conduct specific research.</p>
<p>Question: In the meantime, it seems necessary for national capital to participate considerably. At the same time, what are the plans for government financial revenue? For example, for companies returned by Japan, will the government sell all these shares to the public, so that the government obtains temporary financial revenue? Or will the government continue to hold these shares and use the dividend income to enrich government finances? What are the plans for the operation of enemy property in this regard?</p>
<p>Answer: Of course, anyone is thinking about using it for financial revenue. However, the government does not seem to have specific plans on how to handle it at present, and even the Ministry of Finance has not yet conducted research in this area.</p>
<p>Question: It is expected that there will be many economic aspects among the enemy property to be returned in the second and third times. This issue is a very important financial issue. Has the government not thought about this?</p>
<p>Answer: In terms of adjusting financial and economic issues, the Chinese government and the embassy have completed various studies and preparations based on the nature of the companies. The nature of the companies is different, so it is impossible to generalize. For example, companies that are in two extremes and cannot operate have no need to exist. Therefore, it differs depending on the nature and content of the company. Both sides have drafted considerable proposals, which cannot be announced yet.</p>
<p>Question: When can it be realized?</p>
<p>Answer: It can be handled all at once, or solved gradually one by one.</p>
<p>Question: President Takashima once said: After most of it is returned to the Chinese side, the civilian industries will generally be operated by the Chinese side themselves. The funding plan will also be based on the principle of emphasis this time. Therefore, after the civilian industries are returned to the Chinese side, the funds will generally be raised locally. Can the Chinese side supply these funds in Changdi? Will the civilian industries returned to Changdi and the enemy property recently transferred to the National Government be regarded as China's own finance? If they are returned to national capital, will they be reinvested in Japanese national policy companies?</p>
<p>Answer: The participation of national capital is very easy and not difficult at all.</p>
<p>Question: Next, we would like to ask about the issue of stabilizing people's livelihoods and prices. In order to stabilize people's livelihoods, we must first allocate daily necessities proportionally. To implement the proportional allocation system, we must first investigate the population and investigate households. Now the parties concerned are in trouble because they do not know how many people are in each family. For the sake of future rationing control, haven't you fundamentally thought about investigating the population and reorganizing household registration?</p>
<p>Answer: Although not as strict as in Japan, the household survey is now roughly completed. For example, major cities have citizen certificates, good citizen certificates, etc., which will be closely implemented in the future proportional allocation of materials.</p>
<p>Question: The problem of official prices. Maintaining the official prices of daily necessities will probably be completed soon? For example, can cigarettes be sold at official prices? Is it the same everywhere? If necessities such as rice, soap, candles, matches, and cigarettes are distributed at official prices, it is the best way to stabilize people's livelihoods.</p>
<p>Answer: The first step is to implement the official system starting from a very small number of daily necessities.</p>
<p>Question: To maintain official prices, rationing must be implemented. For example, what is the current method for cigarettes? They are cheap in Japanese stores but expensive in Chinese stores. In cheap places, you can't buy them at any time, while some places have expensive goods. In this case, is the official price system for cigarettes possible?</p>
<p>Answer: Official prices have been established. However, it is impossible to implement official prices that are too far from the actual market prices, that is a certain principle. Therefore, it is the first key point to make official prices naturally implemented. Another key point is to ensure materials. If you cannot have sufficient materials, official prices are certainly futile. If you pay attention to these two points, I don't think there is anything you can't do.</p>
<p>Question: In order to maintain official prices, Japan is strengthening economic police. Do you have this intention here?</p>
<p>Answer: This has been implemented by the Ministry of Interior. Currently, the first group of 40 economic police officers is being trained. Their level is higher than that of ordinary police officers, and they must be higher than ordinary police officers in terms of knowledge and treatment. Such police officers will continue to be trained in the future. The first 40 or so will be active in the Nanjing area.</p>
<p>Question: Speculation in commodities seems to be caused by idle funds, which is related to the Ministry of Finance. The crackdown in this area seems to be very lenient.</p>
<p>Answer: The Ministry of Finance is currently studying this. When the trade association structure is complete in the future, this phenomenon will naturally disappear. At present, loans for speculation are not within the trade association but are speculators outside the industry. After the trade association structure is complete in the future, the Ministry of Industry will issue strict orders to bankers at the same time, strictly prohibiting loans to merchants outside the industry. This is an inevitable trend.</p>
<p>Question: Does the Gold Industry Trade Association participate in the National Federation of Commercial Control?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes. The current chairman of the National Federation of Commercial Control is Mr. Tang Shoumin, a representative of the financial community. Financial control and commercial control will proceed smoothly at the same time in the future.</p>
<p>Question: Cooperation between China and Japan in this way makes the economic power of production and commerce in the peaceful areas very strong. Therefore, compared with the non-peaceful area of Chongqing, this place seems to have an advantage from an economic point of view. In the political aspect, a state of comprehensive peace cannot be achieved because there are opposing opinions. But in the economic aspect, this great economic power seems to be able to extend to the Chongqing area through the contact area. The increase in this power can be said to be the realization of comprehensive economic peace. Regarding this point...</p>
<p>Answer: I believe that this will be successful. If control can proceed smoothly, people's livelihoods in the peaceful areas can be stabilized in half a year. At the same time, it can attract people from the enemy areas to return. Moreover, not only can the people's livelihoods in the peaceful areas be stabilized, but if we grasp the hearts of the people in the Chongqing area, I believe that this incident can also be resolved. Because the exchange of materials is not just materials, but emotions and thoughts can also be exchanged. (Xiang: Translated from the Western Asahi Shimbun, March 29-31) (End)</p>

<p>In light of the recent increasingly severe speculation and hoarding in Shanghai, the government authorities, understanding that most of those engaging in profiteering through hoarding are powerful figures in the financial and industrial sectors, believe that if such speculative and hoarding behaviors are not thoroughly investigated and curbed, they will cause further price increases, harm the people's livelihood and stability, and have a significant impact. Therefore, they have specially ordered Vice Minister Chen Zhishuo of the Ministry of Finance, Vice Minister Yuan Yuquan of the Ministry of Industry, Secretary-General Zhao Zunyue of the Shanghai Municipal Government, and Supervisor Chen Yunwen of the National Commercial Control Association to thoroughly investigate illegal activities such as speculative buying and selling and hoarding of materials by financial and industrial institutions in the city. If proven true after investigation, they should immediately report to the Supreme National Defense Council for special punishment, and the confiscated goods will be confiscated and handed over to the public. It is reported that Chen Zhishuo, after receiving the order, has already arrived in Shanghai and yesterday (the 9th) convened a meeting with Vice Minister Yuan Yuquan of the Ministry of Industry, Secretary-General Zhao of the Municipal Government, Supervisor Chen Yunwen of the Commercial Control Association, and others to discuss the methods of thorough investigation. The thorough investigation is expected to begin immediately. It is said that all financial institutions and industrial and commercial circles in the city, including all past hidden speculative buying and selling activities and the destinations of materials currently hoarded, are targeted for thorough investigation. Those unscrupulous merchants who only seek personal gain and disregard the people's livelihood will find it difficult to escape the law and will be severely punished by the government.</p>

<p>Pan Da, the Director of the Shanghai West Police Bureau, in order to encourage all police officers to treat citizens with a kind attitude, issued an order yesterday, stating in brief: "The police authorities are responsible for protecting, nurturing, guiding the public, maintaining order, and defending public security. They have the closest relationship with the society. Officers should be able to be moderate and amiable in their dealings with people. Moreover, within the jurisdiction of this bureau, there are many important figures, government officials, both Chinese and foreign, residing here, and even more, courtesy should be comprehensive. Any rude words or deeds will be punished. It is imperative that the citizens develop affection and cooperation, trust and respect for this bureau. This Director has high hopes," and so on.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Government believes that the annual seawall projects in the Pudong, Baoshan, and Chongming districts of the city are of great importance and require a large amount of funding. Upon receiving an order from the Central Government, the provinces and cities should raise their own funds for the seawall projects. Although the municipal treasury has coordinated and paid for it, the funds are still insufficient. In order to ensure that the seawall project plans are not interrupted, it has been decided to resume the special pig tax in the city and to levy a tax of 20 yuan per pig, following the tax rate of Jiangsu Province, for funding. All pig transportation within the city limits should pay taxes according to the regulations.</p>
<h3 id="e24">The Municipal Grain Bureau Rectifies Public Grain Sale Institutions in the City <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Since the implementation of grain distribution according to population in the urban area, all institutions handling grain distribution according to population in each district have already been designated to be responsible for the public grain sale offices. These institutions should not be easily changed to avoid affecting grain distribution and increasing the difficulty for citizens to purchase rice. In order to effectively rectify the situation, the Municipal Grain Bureau has issued separate orders to the subordinate district offices stating that in the future, the designated public grain sale offices within each district should not be increased, decreased, or changed without the approval of the Bureau. All district offices should comply with and implement the policy of prioritizing the promotion of grain policy.</p>

<p>According to the Shanghai Rickshaw Pullers Association, the second batch of rice purchase certificates, numbered 33 to 26, will be issued to rickshaw pullers from April 1st to 20th. Rickshaw owners can collect them from the certificate issuing office at 234 Ma Huo Road in the afternoons of each day, except Saturdays. In order to prevent fraud, the association requires that rickshaw owners' applications for rickshaw pullers' extra rice must be based on the rickshaw puller's license. However, the rickshaw puller's license is limited to rickshaw pullers whose certificates actually belong to the rickshaw owner, otherwise it will be invalid.</p>

<h3 id="e28">Children's Welfare Symposium (I): Organized by the Social Service Department of This Newspaper <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Children are the source of the nation and the future masters of the country. The significance of Children's Day lies in arousing the attention of society to children and paying attention to children's education and various welfare undertakings. In the past, very few Children's Days have yielded practical results. After the Children's Day celebrations, children's problems are often put aside.</p>
<p>On Children's Day this year, the Social Service Department of this newspaper specially invited workers from groups who have always been enthusiastic about children's issues and groups dedicated to the education of refugee children, in order to commemorate the 12th Children's Day in our country and to benefit the suffering children who are also the young masters of the country. In addition to specialized scholars, representatives from Catholic, Christian, Buddhist, and various charitable organizations engaged in the education of refugee children were present, marking the beginning of mutual assistance and unity among refugee children's education groups. It is hoped that they can cooperate permanently in the future to solve the difficult problems of the refugee children who have already been accommodated and those who are waiting to be accommodated.</p>
<p>Dr. Hu Zuyin: Having not engaged in the practical work of refugee children's education, I offer my opinions on the cooperation issues of refugee children's education groups from a third-party perspective, divided into two aspects, passive and active: (1) Passive cooperation: For example, the initiation of this Children's Welfare Symposium. The Children's Protection Section of the former Municipal Council also had similar initiatives, allowing for the joint exchange of experiences and joint research on all difficult issues. It is hoped that this type of symposium can be held regularly and can be rotated to various educational institutions to achieve the effect of mutual learning. (2) Active cooperation: It would be best if Shanghai's refugee children's education groups could be centrally managed, which would save a lot of manpower and resources. However, this is purely ideal and may be difficult to achieve in reality. Recently, due to the difficulty of providing supplies, some people have advocated dispersing refugee children to the countryside. Can Shanghai's education groups concentrate on running the system together? If so, food can be requested in the name of the entire education group, providing children with the greatest needs at the most economical nutrition. In addition, manpower can also be saved. This will naturally achieve better results in the entire refugee children's education undertaking.</p>
<p>Dr. Chen Shishi: Considering the high cost of living in cities, it is advisable for refugee children's education groups to relocate to the countryside. New teaching methods must be adopted for refugee children's education. Funding should be subsidized by the government. Normally, contact should be maintained with the education and social authorities to cooperate and divide labor. Orphanages that are structurally similar should be merged. The most important thing is to work together to improve the effectiveness of education.</p>
<h3 id="e29">Tax Investigation Office Strictly Cracks Down on Tax Evasion by Transportation Merchants <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>The Tax Investigation Office of the Ministry of Finance has been established for more than three months and has spared no effort in promoting investigation work. According to the person in charge of the office, the local branches and investigation offices under the jurisdiction of the office have also been established one after another, and efforts have been made to promote tax investigation work. The income from various consolidated taxes, special taxes, and stamp duties on tobacco and alcohol in the spring of this year has increased sharply due to the sharp reduction in smuggling and tax evasion. Taking Shanghai, which is under the jurisdiction of the head office, as an example, in the past three months, hundreds of cases of violations and tax evasion have been detected, including goods from major companies. Due to unfamiliarity with declaration procedures, they are entrusted to unscrupulous transportation merchants to take shortcuts and evade taxes. Therefore, the transportation merchants who specialize in illegal profits will be strictly cracked down on to avoid losses to legitimate merchants. Recently, it has been found that unscrupulous individuals are extorting money under the name of the office. Personnel have also been dispatched to secretly investigate at any time. Once detected, they will be severely punished to ensure the safety of merchants. If people find counterfeit offenders, they can also hand them over to the local police authorities at any time to report the facts and deter cunning individuals.</p>

The content of the regulations is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Special Regulations for the Passage of Emergency Vehicles</p>

<p>Hirota, the intelligence chief of the Japanese Embassy Office, said at a routine meeting with foreign journalists yesterday that the anti-Axis powers completely disregarded more important issues, especially the issue of Chongqing. This is proof of the failure of Eden's mission to the United States. He also pointed out that Eden had virtually admitted the failure of talks with President Rowe in the House of Commons on Thursday, because the scope of the talks was limited to trivial matters, while the following important issues were obviously disregarded: (1) The anti-Axis powers' attitude towards Chongqing; (2) The anti-Axis powers' position towards the Soviet Union; (3) The anti-Axis powers' attitude towards the status of weak countries in the anti-Axis camp. According to Eden's explanation, he did not do this, but discussed with Rowe about the steps to be taken in the war and political cooperation, which cannot be disclosed at present. Hirota continued that even if the above three issues had been discussed by both sides, they would never have reached an understanding. On the point of political cooperation, Hirota said that it could be divided into four items: (1) The anti-Axis powers' attitude towards France; (2) The anti-Axis powers' position towards the neutral countries in Europe; (3) The relationship between Britain and the United States; (4) The post-war policies to be adopted by the anti-Axis powers. There must be a conference to promote world peace. Regarding item (1), Britain sacrificed General de Gaulle everywhere. General Eisenhower, the commander of the Allied forces in North Africa, postponed de Gaulle's trip to North Africa, which is enough to show the anti-Axis powers' policy towards France. Hirota solemnly said that even if the French issue is resolved, de Gaulle will be sacrificed. Therefore, in order to obtain coordination with the United States, Britain does not hesitate to sacrifice its friendship. Regarding item (2), Hirota said that the anti-Axis powers may incite various neutral countries to join their camp or use their usual methods to sabotage the neutrality of other countries. However, we must not stand idly by and let them do whatever they want. Hirota finally said that the anti-Axis powers take maintaining world peace and avoiding another world war after the war as their mantra. However, may I ask who was the culprit of this great disturbance? Eden made bold statements in the House of Commons, which are truly unattainable.</p>
<h3 id="e32">Uniform Issuance System to Be Implemented for Hua Central Regional Epidemic Prevention Certificates; Citizens Requesting Physicians to Inoculate Must Exchange for a Certificate in a Fixed Format <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>A senior official of the Public Works Department's Health Department told reporters yesterday that in order to promote the epidemic prevention movement, once the concession area starts large-scale cholera vaccination on April 20, a unified epidemic prevention certificate system will be implemented within the Hua Central region. The first phase of the epidemic prevention movement in the two concessions this year will start on the 20th, and will be implemented first in the areas where epidemics are most prevalent in the past. The first phase will last until the end of May, and the second phase will start in July and end when the cholera epidemic disappears. The Baojia personnel in the two concession areas will also participate in the promotion. If citizens request physicians to inoculate, they must exchange the certificate issued by the physician for an epidemic prevention certificate in a fixed format from the Health Department. If a physician issues a certificate without inoculation, they will be investigated and punished if found out.</p>

<p>The grain industry in this city, in order to assist the authorities in allocating food for the people, previously telegraphed the Ministry of Food of the National Government to initiate the organization of two joint venture associations for rice and miscellaneous grains.

It is also heard that similar organizations for edible oil and flour are also being initiated, and are jointly planning to proceed under the leadership of the National Government.</p>
<h3 id="e42">Translated Commentary: Thoroughly Investigating Speculation Thoroughly <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Because of the rampant speculation in Shanghai, the National Government issued an order instructing senior officials from the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry, the Shanghai Municipal Government, and the National Commercial Control Association to impartially investigate, "Anyone who engages in speculative buying and selling, manipulates market prices, and disrupts the market, regardless of who they are, should be reported to the Supreme National Defense Council for special punishment, and all materials seized will be confiscated."</p>
<p>The biggest economic problem in Central China now is the rising prices, and the biggest reason is hoarding, which is a consensus view. Now the National Government is resolutely starting to eliminate this evil, which is a timely measure.</p>
<p>Speculators also have their own reasons to explain the legitimacy of rising prices. First, they cite currency deflation, believing that prices will inevitably rise in places where currency is deflated. However, this kind of view is completely contrary to the facts. Just look at the previous proclamation issued by the Public Works Department and the recent statement by the Vice Minister of Finance. They both stated very clearly that the currency in Central China is definitely not more than the old legal tender circulation period. In addition to reserve certificates, even if there is an expansion of so-called credit currency, the discussants also believe that it does not have the nature of inflation. Taking a step back, even if this is considered a reason, the current price increases are definitely not legitimate.</p>
<p>The second basis for speculators is that production is shrinking and materials are lacking. However, on this point, the facts also contradict their eloquence. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, production activities in Central China have indeed been sluggish, so it is undeniable that production is shrinking. However, the lack of materials caused by the shrinking of production is definitely not the reason for today's soaring prices. Thinking about the huge inventory, the amount of materials existing in Central China or Shanghai has not decreased recently.</p>
<p>What is the reason for the soaring prices? It can be said that it is caused by the deliberate distortion and forced explanation of the relationship between currency and materials. If the materials currently existing in Central China are bought and sold in a normal quantity and method to make them circulate, then the prices will naturally be balanced. However, because of the activities of speculators, the smooth operation is hindered. Hoarding! Profiteering! As a result, the quantity of circulating materials in reality is less than the quantity of materials existing in reality. This situation stimulates the general public, and all cash is transferred to the only materials. The above-mentioned bad cycle is the best example of the abnormal shape of prices in Central China.</p>
<p>The only way to correct this situation is the above-mentioned must eradicate speculative buying. The National Government's measures this time are for this purpose. The real problem is not in reciting and understanding economic theories, but in how to implement specific economic policies based on these theories. We dare to say frankly here that some people now believe that at least most of those who are doing evil and hindering the economy of Central China are related to the members of the National Government. We certainly do not hope that it is true, but in any case, if the National Government solves this problem smoothly, it can achieve the two major goals of economic recovery and grasping the hearts of the people. This is what we earnestly desire with great enthusiasm. (Translated by Yunpeng from the Continental New News on April 9)</p>

<p>According to a Shanghai dispatch from the Central News Agency, since the National General Association of Commerce's Office for the Movement of Goods began accepting applications for permits to move goods in and out on March 16th, many Chinese and Japanese merchants have applied. A significant number have already obtained permits and completed their goods movement. The office is now strictly enforcing the attached conditions on the permits, and is urging merchants who received permits for moving goods in and out before March 20th to promptly submit their expired permits and receipts to the office for cancellation, as the validity period has expired. It is reported that failure to submit expired permits for cancellation will result in the cancellation of their eligibility for a second application.</p>
<h3 id="e44">New Exchange Settlement Methods Between North and Central China <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the exchange settlement methods between North and Central China, in the past, military scrip exchange, special yen exchange, and Shanghai exchange were used together. Military scrip exchange was used for remittances from the Japanese side and for settling transactions of specific goods such as coal, wheat flour, cotton yarn, and cotton cloth. Special yen exchange was used for settling transactions of other general goods. Shanghai exchange was used for remittances from the Chinese side and for settling import and export transactions without exchange. However, since the issuance of new military scrip was stopped on April 1st, the above settlement methods should also be fundamentally reformed. What are the new settlement methods? All parties are paying close attention. Regarding this matter, after discussions between the Central China and North China bureaus, it has been tentatively decided to adopt the following settlement methods, which have been implemented since April 1st.</p>
<p>(1) The original military scrip exchange will, in principle, be changed to Central Reserve Bank of China note exchange from April 1st, that is, direct settlement will be based on the ratio of 100 Central Reserve Bank of China notes to 18 military scrip. General remittances that previously used military scrip exchange will now be converted to Central Reserve Bank of China note exchange. The exchange for travelers will be changed to direct exchange between Central Reserve Bank of China notes and Federal Reserve Bank of China notes. Furthermore, the settlement of specific goods transactions that previously used military scrip exchange will, in principle, be changed to Central Reserve Bank of China note exchange, but a portion of specific goods will use special yen settlement.</p>
<p>(2) The settlement of general goods transactions will continue to be in special yen. However, the special yen exchange rate had different prices for imports and exports in the past, with 17 military scrip for sales and 18 military scrip for purchases. Now, the rate will be completely unified, with a uniform rate of 18 military scrip for both imports and exports from April 1st, with only a 0.5% handling fee.</p>
<p>(3) The settlement of transactions without exchange will continue to use Shanghai exchange.</p>
<p>As for Shanghai exchange, the Federal Reserve Bank of China has adopted a centralized system, with the official exchange rate being 30 Federal Reserve Bank of China notes for 100 Central Reserve Bank of China notes. Although there are clear regulations for this controlled Shanghai exchange, there is currently a significant amount of free Shanghai exchange (black market exchange between Central Reserve Bank of China notes and Federal Reserve Bank of China notes) between Chinese banks and money shops. Therefore, it is practically impossible to completely ban this free Shanghai exchange, and it is generally believed that free Shanghai exchange will continue to exist in the future.

Furthermore, the exchange with Thailand, Vietnam, and other southern regions will be settled by converting Central Reserve Bank of China notes into the local currency.

<h3 id="e48">Comprehensive Rationing of Japanese Daily Necessities <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>As the war becomes increasingly protracted, the controlled rationing of goods becomes more important. The smooth rationing of daily necessities is essential for ensuring domestic security and national unity. Japan's current rationing agencies can be said to have been established separately for each type of goods due to the development of various control regulations. However, because of the complexity of the types of agencies, there are still many shortcomings, resulting in situations such as monopolized sales, uneven distribution of goods, and black market prices. Although there are many reasons, one is that the multiple goods are related to the rationing agencies which are different and are not comprehensively rationed. Therefore, it is not possible to establish a consumer plan, which is the biggest reason.</p>
<p>The rationing organization of "purchasing cooperatives" is a consumer organization, so it is the most suitable and rational way to correct the above shortcomings. However, a comprehensive expansion of purchasing cooperatives would ultimately require a fundamental reorganization of the entire national commerce. As the war deepens, the adjustment of daily necessities rationing agencies becomes more necessary. Therefore, the National Consumers' Cooperative Association of Japan has put forward the following countermeasures for the government to consider and implement. The proposed contents are: (1) Urban rationing agencies should have a "public" character and have close relationship with consumers, so that consumers can assist locally. (2) Organize consumers nationwide to establish an agency capable of comprehensive rationing. (3) Change the areas of neighborhood associations into appropriate economic zones and establish consumer organizations there, with neighborhood units as their internal organization. (4) Designate the most terminal distribution points as comprehensive distribution points and select stores with this qualification to operate or supervise the above-mentioned consumer organizations. (5) Consumer organizations should formulate rationing consumption plans within the zone, and through the neighborhood unit, contact the town association, and comprehensively guide consumers. (6) Consumer organizations should organize federations and jointly form councils with rationing agencies, industry patriotism associations, etc., to be responsible for deciding on rationing goods, rationing methods, and other rationing adjustments.

<h3 id="e50">The Thrift of the Germans <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>— Jian Nong</p>
<p>The thrift of the Germans is admirable! Their twenty years of enduring hardship and biding their time has been obvious to all and need not be said. Since the outbreak of this war, they have been pooling their wisdom and military strength, actively producing, and doing everything possible to save energy and contribute strength. Consider this recent fact:</p>
<p>According to a Hai Tong News Agency report, Germany is now restricting and regulating even women's clothing. Dr. Bao Aier, head of the Textile Section of the German Ministry of Economy, has a great aversion to fashionable women's clothing. He issued a statement saying, "What we need now is cotton cloth and tailoring suitable for the wartime economy. German women should get used to wearing clothes as simple as those of ancient Spartans." More humorously, the doctor added, "Men should be encouraged to see in their new attire that they have 'attractive power.'" - This, I think the doctor is a bit too worried. - As a result, after he issued this statement, German fashion companies will only be able to sell practical styles of clothing in the future, and only styles prescribed by the state can be displayed in glass windows.</p>
<p>What about the situation in Shanghai? In this season of pleasant weather, gentle breezes, green willows and red peach blossoms, countless young ladies and wives are probably racking their brains to plan their 1943 spring clothes, preparing for a contest of novelty and beauty? This is not our men's business, and we should not overstep our bounds and meddle too much. What attitude should we take ourselves? I believe that in this time of difficulty in obtaining even a thread and scarcity of materials, we do not have to deliberately imitate the cynical behavior of the ancient Greek Stoic school, who wore tattered robes and were proudly self-satisfied - they disdained honor and despised social etiquette, almost destroying all conditions for comfortable living and returning to the pure society of ancient times, so they adopted the beggar's staff and luggage as a symbol of the philosopher. - But the spirit of Zilu, a highly talented disciple of Confucius, who "stood without shame in tattered hemp clothes alongside those who wore fox and badger furs" is indispensable! However, perhaps some people think this is a way of "the fox eating sour grapes," a way of comforting oneself and relieving embarrassment...</p>
<h3 id="e51">Nervousness <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Lin</p>
<p>"Nervousness" is also a great enemy that kills one's life achievements. A nervous person, whether in the family, at school, or in society, is a person who never has a moment of peace. He does not know what "happiness" is, what is the joy of group life.</p>
<p>Nervousness is psychologically one of the mental illnesses, his self-consciousness is keen in searching, amplifies self-esteem, and obscures his own personality. Before an external stimulus reaches the threshold of stimulation, a nervous person is already restless. In his mind, he is always a "target of public criticism." No matter what he says or does, or what others are saying or doing, he imagines that everyone is criticizing him, analyzing him, and even scolding, insulting, and secretly laughing at him.</p>
<p>Over time, we can imagine that he will never start doing what he desires and plans. He seems to feel that there are thousands of eyes closely looking for his mistakes. He thinks that if he succeeds, others will definitely be jealous. What if he fails? He dare not even imagine it... So he "achieves nothing" and "lives a frustrated life."</p>
<p>If we think about it carefully, there are too many such people. Because nine out of ten cowards who only retreat and never advance suffer from nervousness.</p>
<p>In a small sense, it can destroy a useful life. In a large sense, it will hinder social progress. The way to get rid of it is not to take yourself too seriously or too lightly. Take an interest in things outside of yourself, live a group life, and do not underestimate the personality of others... Then make an absolute determination to control your overly sensitive nerves. Always give others sympathy. If you can do this, you can get true freedom and achieve success happily.</p>

<p>— Xin Bo</p>
<p>Perhaps A Chou was not a person who liked crowds of people, so he did not walk up the steps where they came down, but veered slightly to the west, touching a dry stone stream, took a few steps, and then went towards the top of the mountain. Da Gen followed him. In this way, when they reached the top of the mountain, they bypassed a City God Temple and arrived at the Tian Qi Temple in the center of the mountain.</p>
<p>There were five or six temples on this mountain, located at almost the same distance apart on the top of the mountain, which was long and stretched from southeast to northwest. The San Mao Temple was relatively low, and the other four were at almost the same height. There was open ground to the left and right and in front of the Tian Qi Temple, so there were many people doing business and playing. The people in the temple were really crowded, so they did not go in.</p>
<p>A Wu greedily looked around. Although everything he saw was familiar, he never let it go easily during this once-a-year opportunity. He and Da Gen had different points of attention. He still looked at Chongwen Town in the south. It was a little different from what he had seen in front of Xiaolingshan. He felt that it was particularly low and narrow. Tangjia Mountain in the south of the town was particularly close, as if he could cross it with one step. His eyes gradually shifted from far to near, landing on Lingshan Bay at the foot of the mountain. Lingshan Bay really had a good situation. Behind it was the long Lingshan, the branch ridge extending south from the western end of Lingshan on the right, and the junction of Lingshan and Xiaolingshan on the left, with Longhumen forming its eastern key. It faced Chongwen Town from a distance, but the terrain was much higher than Chongwen Town. The terrain gradually lowered step by step to the south, and it was not until it completely broke away from the embrace of the hills on the east and west sides that it was truly flat land.</p>
<p>There were a dozen or so houses scattered sparsely in the bay. Some were connected in groups of three or five, and some were alone, distributed according to the best locations. Wisps of cooking smoke mixed with the wet mist. Although they were not far apart, they did not look very clear. Therefore, A Wu could not find Da Gen's home there. (28)</p>

<p>The story of "Man Jiang Hong" is about a courtesan by the Qinhuai River who falls in love with a poor painter. The poor painter also loves her. The courtesan, misunderstanding that the painter has fallen in love with someone else, is forced to fall in love and marry someone else. The poor painter suspects that she is only destined for destruction under the control of money. Later, after understanding that everything was due to a misunderstanding, it was impossible to salvage. The courtesan sacrifices her own life for the sake of her lover. The accompaniment also has a courtesan in the Qinhuai River, a poor photographer falls in love with her, and helps her, but love needs money, she can't marry him, later, this poor photographer becomes famous and rich, they are married, other wealthy gentlemen, poor artists, people who regard love as a play, and ugly aunties - pimps, are quite lively. I haven't read the original, but I don't understand what changes were made after the adaptation?</p>
<p>It is said that the play was written collectively, and I agree with what was said in the "Man Jiang Hong" post-reading, that I doubt whether this script was written by one person, its artistic tone is very harmonious and unified, there are places to point out, that scene when they meet at "Qingliang Mountain", it is still not emphasized enough, the satire is not sharp enough, that courtesan falling in love with that glib youth Wan Zaiqing in West Lake is superfluous, it will obscure the character of that courtesan, I even more disapprove of making the banker Wan Youguang become such a character, a loyal but not faithful, sincere but not sincere character, this kind of person simply doesn't understand what love is, he only knows the satisfaction of lust, relying on the power of his money to dominate a woman, and after he is tired of this one, he can find another woman, and that poor photographer Li Taihua still marries that other courtesan Xiao Xiang, what is the biggest problem for the whole play? Love cannot be forced, and even more cannot be opportunistic, Xiao Xiang should not get such a result, this is my opinion, in short, these are the lack of awareness in the original, and the mistakes left behind, although the playwriting skills are skillful, they still cannot hide them.</p>
<p>The director is also very dedicated, and has arranged the three acts and eight scenes without any confusion, and clearly explains them to the audience. Some places can be seen to have taken a lot of effort, especially the last few scenes, which are very difficult, unless one has rich experience and cultivation to handle them so appropriately.</p>
<p>Among the actors, Lan Lan's role is the most important, every scene has her in it, with her ability, she is very capable of taking on the role, and plays that courtesan very realistically, clear lines, skilled acting skills, fully able to portray the courtesan, such a long play and can be meticulous, the up-and-coming actors should emulate her, it is a pity that she said that she is saying goodbye to the audience after this play, I hope this is not true, this theater stage is in great need of such excellent actors like her, Bai Chen plays the banker, and is very able to perform the personality of the person in the play. Hai Tao's Sun Shi played well, Li Zongshan's Xiao Xiang was not bad, Liu Ji's Li Taihua was very successful and other actors were very competent.</p>
<p>"Man Jiang Hong" is adapted from Zhang Henshui's novel, so the whole play lacks pure awareness, only has shallow expressions, and no deep meaning of life, the director, playwright and actors are all above standard, the great scenery, lighting effects are very beautiful, if it is completely for entertainment, then it is worth watching.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Accept Criticism <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Yun</p>
<p>Everyone has shortcomings, and with shortcomings, one cannot avoid being criticized by others.</p>
<p>Criticism has good intentions and malicious intentions. Good intentions are a good lesson or admonition. On the contrary, malicious criticism is slander, it is the erasure of one's personality, and the alienation of others. We should accept it with different attitudes.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, secretly gossiping about people is mostly unfaithful criticism, that is, slander. Slander. This harmful and self-serving, bad method is so despicable! We can laugh off this kind of criticism and there is absolutely no reason to defend it or to be afraid of it.</p>
<p>Conversely, we should accept well-intentioned criticism without any doubt, no matter who it comes from. This is extremely important for success in career and achievement in scholarship.</p>
<p>Often, we cannot instinctively distinguish whether a criticism is well-intentioned or malicious. In this case, we might as well accept the criticism and then use reflection to examine ourselves. If there is something to admit, admit it frankly and strive to correct it. If there is nothing to admit, then remain calm. In this way, whether it is slander or defamation, it is just a waste of effort for the other party.</p>

<h3 id="e55">Organizing an Elderly Welfare Association <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Ximing</p>
<p>· Welfare for the Elderly · Improve People's Hearts</p>
<p>The elders of the He Qi Nian Hui, Qi Lao Hui, and the soon-to-be-formed Qi Ying Hui, taking advantage of today's trend, organize an "Elderly Welfare Association," starting with helping the poor elderly, called "Ji Lao". Let those who have the strength contribute their strength, those who have money contribute their money, benefit the elderly, and improve people's hearts. The methods are as follows: (1) Seek the cooperation of colleagues from the Qi Hui and distribute the responsibilities widely. (2) Seek the support of kind people in society and open up another channel. (3) Encourage the elderly to rely on their own efforts and do some work. (4) Encourage the elderly to be determined and do some business. I believe that the elderly must work. Although their physical strength is weak, their mental strength should be strong. As the saying goes: There is no greater sorrow than the death of the heart, and physical death is secondary. Being old is not sad, what is sad is being old and unsuccessful, and the elderly are still greedy. The elderly should have a sense of self-respect and self-responsibility, and strive to live on their own and help others. Profiting without labor should be deeply cautioned against. This kind of elderly person can be saved, otherwise, what is the point of saving an elderly person whose heart is dead? Only the elderly with a living life can be saved. Heaven helps those who help themselves, and human power is limited!</p>
