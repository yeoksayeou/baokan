<p>社評</p>
<h3>國際新局面與東亞</h3>
<p>羅斯福與邱吉爾在奎貝克會談結束以來，巳經一個多星期了，歐洲局勢還在微妙的演變中。軍事方面，西西里和哈科夫軸心軍陣地轉移以來，雙方正在準備第二階段的戰爭。東綫的戰爭重心，正向南移動，蘇軍顯然在對烏克蘭腹地的進出，尤其是對黑海控制權的爭奪。因爲這兩著棋子，如果給下定了，那是問鼎巴爾幹半島的先決條件。然而，這裏他所要遭遇到的，不僅是德軍的鋼鎚，而且還有英美的鐵鉗。也就是說，不僅是軍事的，而且還有政治的阻力。</p>
<p>共次，在西錢方面，西西里島軸心軍的北撤，所造成的新局面，不是美英軍隊之繼續推進，而是軸心軍在義國防衛力量的鞏固。無疑問的，戰事的沉寂，是軸心軍所希望的，美英問多一天躊躇，就使軸心軍多一天準備。但是，像蘇聯一樣責備美英遲不在西錢　闢弟二戰綫，未免有些性急病態，因爲英美是在替自己的霸權打算，並小是爲蘇聯打算。他們的野心，還在於對巴爾幹的爭奪，他們更怕赤化。於是，西綫又陷於暫時的沉寂，北非和地中海的軍隊在蠢動。甚至有向東移調的謠傳。</p>
<p>英美蘇聯之間之略與戰略的矛盾，使萬目睽睽的奎貝克會談以不自然的公布結束。矛盾的焦點，決不如他們的公報所稱爲歐洲第一或太平洋第一問題，只在所謂第二戰塲的地點，時間與戰略問題。在地點上，蘇聯政府雖然從未有何公開表示，但是它的報章雜誌却曾用著名軍事評論家刊登戰略論文，他們不承認北非及西西里之戰爲第二戰綫，甚至預先否認對義大利本土的攻擊為第二戰綫，他們認為只有以倫敦為中心，向法國，比利時，荷蘭或丹麥進攻，才是最理想的第二戰錢，特別注重於渡越不很闊的英吉利海峽的進攻方向。但英國則不承認這些，他們以爲最好是向巴爾幹推進。至於戰略，蘇方一再聲言空中攻勢的盲轟濫炸不能決定戰局，必須向大陸進軍；美英則與此相反，以爲除非對巴爾幹才有大軍推進的可能。而在時間方面，蘇聯主張立即開闢西綫，美英則以爲非至明年不能妄言大陸作戰。</p>
<p>我們應該指出，至今日爲止，美英蘇間的矛盾，固然在趨向激化一途，然而，還只止於上述政略與戰略上的衝突，就整個作戰方針上的聯合，並沒有發生澈底的裂痕，因此，常蘇聯撤回邁斯基和李維諾夫之際，就宣言三國關係的破裂，未免言之過早。在今日，美英開始對蘇聯的防範，自是應有之事，而蘇聯之利用夏季攻勢以進行共外交活動，亦爲必然趨向，不過，以英國本身的衰弱與美國在東西兩而受敵的顧慮之下，很顯然的，今日唐寗街與白宮的主人是不得不對蘇聯遷就的。艾登慌慌張張的向開羅追踪邁斯基到倫敦，台維斯也趕快參加艾邁會談，反軸心國之開的矛盾，在大局的逼迫之下，似乎還不還覓得暫時的妥協吧。所以，軸心國戰士的日光，不應該集注在美英蘇問的矛盾上向，而必須提高警惕心，利用敵方矛盾，爭取時間，準備決戰。</p>
<p>在美英蘇矛盾發展中忽促發表的雜邱奎貝克會談的公報中，居然宣言此次會談的重心在討論「太平洋大反攻」，只要稍有常識的人，就可以知道，這是新式的外交詞令，因爲如果眞想幹一下，誰也不會自己將戰略向對方公開的！不過，這一宣吿的背後的意義，我們也不能完全漠視。第一，美英這樣一穴傳，多少可以綏和蘇聯方面對美英遲不開闢第二戰綫的憤慨，替另闢三國談判之門預爲張本；第二，當渝方戰鬥力日趨衰弱戰鬥情緒日趨降落之時，這一宣吿多少可以掃除一些悲觀失望的情緒。第三，緬甸的雨季瞬將結束，日軍隨時有打破印度之大門的可能，而江特拉·鮑斯統率約印度獨立軍，正在秣馬厲兵，準備爲印度復國而戰，印度人心騷然，這，宣言，又含有對印　嚇與鎭壓的作川。</p>
<p>事實上美國所謂太平洋反攻，從去年秋天就已開始不斷的嘗試了，然而除了艦隊空軍的犧牲之外，依然侷促於澳大利亞門戶之間，未能越所羅門羣島及新幾內亞雷池一步。特別是在今天，友邦日本以外交與政治的戰鬥，輔　軍事，我國主權完　之逐漸實現，泰國故土之恢復，緬甸獨立之成功，東印度土民之參政，菲列賓獨立之籌備，以至印度民族解放運動之協力，所有這種事實，爲大東亞局勢穩定的最大保障，民心的擁護，誠所謂三軍可奪其帥，匹夫不可奪志，美英縱謀以武力反攻，其能擊破今日東亞民族的團結嗎？雖然，以美國年來對阿拉斯加公路之經營，對阿留申羣島之戰備，近來在印度之軍事活動，以及利用渝方空軍根據地等，活動所在，我們也不能過於輕視。消除太平觀念，振作戰鬥精神，團結亞洲十一億同胞，　牲奮鬥，爭取東亞民族解放戰爭的勝利，應該是我們今日的最高目標。</p>

<h3>中樞隆重追悼　和運殉國先烈　汪主席報告紀念先烈意義</h3>
<p>南京一日中央社雷　九月一日爲和運先烈殉國紀念日，首都各界除一律厯旗誌哀外，中樞特於是日上午九時，在國府大禮堂舉行和運先烈殉國紀念典禮。到國府注主席以下各院部會處署長官，　中央黨部執監委員等。主席台上，中懸國旅及國父　象，　　有共桌。供桌上供有和運諸先烈之靈位及花囤。台前供奉鮮花，布置　穆莊嚴。九時正，隆重典禮開始。主席就位後，全體肅立，齊唱國歌。嗣向國旗及國父遺像行最敬禮。主席恭讀國父遺囑畢，即領導全體向和述殉國諸先靈位行一鞠躬禮，以示哀悼，並靜默誌哀，恭獻花圍。一時哀樂齊奏，禮堂充滿肅穆氣氛。奏樂畢，主席報吿紀念和運殉國先烈之意義，徐文　代讀，詞意沉痛，全塲感奮。末奏和遝先烈紀念歌。至十一時許，此隆車之典禮，在哀樂聲中，宣</p>
<p>汪主席演講詞原文南京一日中央社電　今日晨九時，中　方而於國府大禮堂舉行和運先烈殉國紀念典禮，汪主席　　領導各院部會　官舉行儀式，並致詞。主席因稍有感胃喉痛，交由徐文官長代讀，原詞全文如左</p>
<p>自從民國二十九年今日，第一次爲全國和運先烈開紀念大會，到了今日，是第四次了。追念過去，體察現在，遠瞻將來，悲痛之餘，十分興奮。</p>
<p>和運先烈　於和運竭共心力，繼之以死，實根據着一個最崇高的理想，最堅強的信念，以爲一切行動的準繩。這理想與信念是什麼呢？是國父的大亞洲主義。和運先烈知道復興中國，復興東亞，除此以外，沒有第二條路。爲實現大亞洲主義，須中國自己努力。因爲中國若不能努力，以求得獨立自由，則無分担東亞責任之資格。同時中國於自己努力之外，還要與日本協力。因爲日本是東亞的先進國，中國必須與日本站在一條綫上，向着同一方向走去。即使一時因軍事外交方針不能一致，而發生糾紛，必須努力使之好轉纔能共同對付一侵略東亞的敵人，英美帝國主義者</p>
<p>經上是每一個　　　烈所同具的崇高的理想，堅強的信念。和運當初，國內民衆對於此理想與信蔫，不能了解，因而遇着許多苦難。於是許多先烈，便因而犧牲了。後死同志踏着先烈的血路，繼續奮鬥，一步步前進。到了今年一月九日，中國參加大束亞戰爭，這是說，中國與日本已經站在一條綫上了，已經向着同一方　而携手前進了。這是幾十年來兩國志士所寤寐求之的，一日得到，我們在今日願意以至誠至敬，吿慰於和運先烈在大之靈。</p>
<p>同時，友邦日本爲了實踐援助巾國完成獨立的諾言，於今年一月九日和中國締結協定，提前交還租界，撤銷治外法權。到了八月一日，全國巳經不復有租界存在了　撒銷治外法權也開始實行了。復興中國，復興東亞，兩件事是一件事，於此益以證明，我們在今日願意以至誠至敬，告慰於和運先烈在天之靈。</p>
<p>過去的艱難險阻，和運先烈飽　於前，一死少後，還以靈光照耀著我們，使我們得以鼓勇前進。我們的心靈興和運先烈的心靈遙遙相接，無一息之問斷。現在民衆對於和　的了解，漸漸的普徧了來歸的軍隊也漸漸的增加了。我們相信全面和平早晚定能實現，大東亞戰爭勝利早晚定能完遂。我們惟有以刻苦耐勞勇猛精進的精神，循著和運先烈所照耀著的大路，邁步前進</p>
<p>廣州舉行民衆大會廣州一日中央社電　一日爲獻身和運先烈之殉國紀念日，廣州自上午九時起，在中山紀念堂盛大舉行民衆大會。出席陳省長以下各廳長。及日本南方面派遣軍最高指揮官以下官民代表等。情緒緊張熱烈，至上午十時閉會。</p>
<h3>為政府收買紗布　汪主席聲明　申請出賣限期已近</h3>
<p>南京一日巾央社電　國府爲體卹商艱，前經行政院　一七四次會議通過，補辦棉紗棉布登記，限期爲十五日，逾限即依法沒收。當由行政院令飭全國商業統制會遵照辦理，商統總會於奉到院令後，即由收買棉紗布辦事處通吿，定八月廿七日起開始實施工作，並辦理補行登記，並遵照院令，決定於九月六日截止，不再展期。茲以限期已近，汪兼行政院長爲重申政府收買棉紗棉布之決心，特發表二次聲明如左：</p>
<p>上月九日，政府決定收買棉紗布政策，純爲抑平物價，安定民生着想。對於棉紗布正當　　者之利益，亦已兼顧。除訂定　外，並已由木人發表聲明，其要點如下：　照當時黑市價格，廿支紗每包至四萬元，其他紗布稱是，民問欲以公定價根置一疋之棉布，亦不可得，其困苦可想。且以此之故，棉紗布不復爲民問日用品，徒爲投機居奇者所利用。生產因而停滯、經濟現狀爲之杌隉不安。　政府久欲實行收買政策，惟听攷慮者，如以大宗國幣收買，　市血不免有通貨膨脹之恐慌。幸而友邦日　，鑒此苦衷，力爲援助，始得決定以一半黃金，一半國幣，從事收買。如此通貨膨脹之恐慌既可免除。而商民得到黃金，其利益更爲確實。　廿支紗定價萬元，或嫌共少，須知黑市之四萬元，實爲不正當　益，萬難如其所願。且當時黑市每金卞兩最高至十二萬，今要綱決定，每　十兩僅四萬元，是　廿支紗定價萬元，而實際已超於萬元矣。　或者　　民資本短少『分　交付難於周轉，須知若不分　交付，則通貨膨脹之弊，仍所難免，不可不以公益爲重。　或慮政府收買棉紗布之後，不免濫用。須如政府施行此種政策，係爲復興經辨着想，對內用於收買糧食，收買棉花，及其他工業原料。對外　循物物交易之原則，以之獲得大豆，米穀，雜糧，如此則民食得以調劑，而農工業亦得以振起，其作用至大。根據以上各　，可知收買棉紗布政策，關係國利民福，政府必以最大的決心，迅速確實　之施行。日前爲體恤商艱，曾補行棉紗布登記，以十五日爲限，至本月六日截止，已於是日特電商業統治總會，申明不再延期之決心。至於棉　布申　出賣，亦以本月六日爲最後期限，聞仍有心存觀望，希求一再延期者，此實爲認識不足。用特鄭重聲明，願我商民共以大局爲重，捐除私見，協助政府貫徹政策，務於本月六日以前，辦理申請出賣手　，勿以爲尙有延期可能，庶幾不致自誤且誤大局也。兼行政院院長汪兆銘。</p>

<h3>東歐戰綫各處　情勢極緊張　德軍作有效防御戰</h3>
<p>瑞典京城一日中央社電德軍自卡科夫，阿夫共爾加，泰幹洛格等要衝撤退後，東綫南部地區悄勢遂　現緊張，蘇軍乘德軍縮短戰綫之際，即在庫斯克西方之西夫斯克及維亞茲馬西方開始大攻勢，目前正對斯摩陵斯克，布利安斯克，波爾太伐，克拉斯　達，斯達林諾，馬畏坡之德軍新防綫反覆猛攻，與德軍展開慘烈之戰鬥。三十一日蘇聯發表戰況公報，曾　稱：斯摩陵斯克地區之蘇軍，突破　軍一部防綫，於三十一日佔領斯摩稜斯克東方四十五公里之交通要衝葉爾挪，在卡科夫西方及西雨方仍繼續進攻。又據德國方面悄報，德軍常局僅聲述德軍於全綫正對優勢之蘇軍作有效之防禦戰，故刻下蘇軍已前進至何處則尙不明。又據合衆社莫斯科電稱：西夫斯克地區蘇軍，三十日已進至庫斯克西方六十里之里爾斯克及格魯里夫突入北烏克蘭。又謂：卡科夫西方及西雨方德軍之反攻熾烈達於極點，故已阻止蘇軍之前進，斯達林諾地區蘇軍，對於德軍之周密防衛頗有無法措手之苦。</p>
<p>德集中大軍增援沿海區</p>
<p>柏林一日中央社電　德軍當局稱：東綫德軍爲節約兵力，有時作地域之　步因此德軍司令部得以強力集結於歐洲其他部分，在歐洲海岸地區警備一切之不測事悄，然此並非自東綫撤退兵力之意，乃德國過去六個月內，在國內編成新銳部隊之大部去運往東綫，而配置於歐洲大陸各地之意。且此等部隊極富機械化性能，若有必要亦能立即運往東綫，故德軍司令部僅以東綫之預備軍即能充分遂行防御戰，並不需要自西歐之緩助，由此　之，德軍在束綫防禦戰之成功，益增加其重要性。</p>

<p>阿根廷京城一日中央社電英首相邱吉爾上月三十一日晚在奎貝克對全世界廣播講演，始終專以逢迎蘇聯與斯達林爲主，且於廣播中力主舉行英美蘇三國外長會議，其演詞略誌如次：此次奎貝克會議泰半以強化對日作戰爲主題，惟以蘇聯政府與日政府尙締有中立條約，故英美兩國政府對是否邀　斯達林委員長出會議事，　　未決，然與斯達林委員長舉行三人會談，實為余與羅斯福總統所迫切希望者，過去未舉行三人會談，決非英美兩國政府未盡全力之故，乃係斯達林委員長須親自指揮東綫蘇軍作戰，未使輕離本國所致。然羅斯福總統與余皆認爲不僅應召開英美蘇三國外長會議，俾從事檢討各項重要間題，即三國首腦會談亦所必要。且爲使英美蘇二國間之意見日趨一致，實屬絕對必要云又邱吉爾言及蘇聯結結成第二戰錢之要求，謂蘇聯人士曾要求英美兩國政府担負重荷之一半，彼等因第二戰綫迄未結成，乃憤然表不不滿，並加以責難，世余對於蘇聯並未作若何非難云。此外又謂個人除第二戰綫外，以爲北非作戰必將被　爲絕奸之作戰，美軍澳洲軍及新西　軍總　於太平洋對日軍作戰，惟印度方面戰綫中之重要任務，將由英軍負担，此次由英美兩軍組成之海陸空三軍聯合作戰司合部，定將達成所期之目的，最後邱氏稱，彼正在之考慮。並預言於來日中，將對德國加緊空中攻勢，但拒絕預測戰爭結束之日期，因此種投機性之推測，實無益於作戰也。</p>
<p>萬斯基艾登昨再度長談</p>
<p>里斯本三十一日中央社電據倫敦消息：在倫敦向英政府傾袖辭行之蘇外交次長邁斯基，昨日曾與英外相艾登作長談。據信係與奎貝克會議之結果有關，並準備在倫敦或及斯科舉行三強會議。邁氏係於星期六晚返抵英京，曾與艾登私下會晤一次，然後又於昨日作官式之訪問。</p>
<h3>丹麥政府當局　向國王辭職　英美間接戰略失敗</h3>
<p>柏林一日中央社電　據海通社訉：此間消息靈通人士昨證實丹麥政府巳向國王克利斯興提出辭呈。丹麥政府刻已訓令各官員爲國家之利益着想，仍應照常奉公守職，目前情形尚無需根據戒嚴令，設立軍事法庭，德國特使貝斯特現仍在丹麥。關於此次丹麥之動亂，外交部對英方之言論及英權威方面就有否英國或丹麥傘兵在丹麥降　一項問題所發表之答覆，極爲注意，其答覆且謂事關軍事，故需保守秘密準此而論，英方之拒不闡明，即不啻承　外國秘密工作人員實經間接或直接負此丹麥動亂之責任，八月二十八日英廣播公司發言人雷賽且作同樣之承認曰，丹麥最近怠工事件大見增加，此皆得力於英傘兵之助也。倫敦「星報」亦謂，丹麥助　之勃發，　尙嫌其過早。英廣播公司發言人其後更謂，此次丹麥動亂殆爲策　在德軍佔領區展開暴動　鎖之第一環，其發動之日期皆由協約軍司令部所定云。德外交部人士繼謂，此次丹麥事件誠屬尙嫌過早，德當局遂獲及時挫收協約國之計劃，此間人士相信此項計劃，即八月三十日「每日電聞報」所倡導之「問接戰略。」其運用之目的如次：　恐嚇平民，　英國欲行其傳統政策，引誘他國人民爲其作戰。　煽惑人民，誘其不顧危險，對佔領當局取敵視行動。</p>
<h3>大西洋之戰的新情勢　潛水艇防御戰的改進</h3>
<p>據最近英美方面的面同發表，在五六七三個月之間，英美擊沉德國潛水艦數，稱爲「大戰開始以來最好的成績」。又據他們的發表，自本年一月以來的八個月內被潛水艦擊沉的英美船舶，比去年下半期减二分之一，比前半期减四份之一。另一敵方宣傳稱，西西里登陸戰中使用於大西洋，地中海的船舶達二千五百艘，其中被潛水艦擊沉者僅百萬噸。英美常局興高采烈的說「敵人潛水艦的最大威脅，現在解除了。今年內船帕的激增，預定可以超出擊沉數」，</p>
<p>常然，他們的宣傳不能完全加以信任。但所謂「大西洋之戰』，在德國潛水艦視爲暫時不免陷於苦戰，這幾個月以來，沒有以前邢樣活躍。此在德國海軍方而人士木身也常自行指出。那麼，這苦戰從何而來呢</p>
<p>新護航制度</p>
<p>簡單地說來，因爲敵方加強飛機的攻擊。目前德軍在英美的對德轟炸上，在地中海戰綫及束戰綫，正被迫陷於苦戰中。這巾間最大的原因，似乎在於飛機，而「大西洋之戰」中，現在所致的新悄勢，也似乎在於飛機。無論怎樣說，潛水艦戰終究是德國最大的武器之一，德國海軍總司令寳尼茲提督今春在某次宴會中稱：「那（指潛水艦戰）雖沒有即刻的效果，也未可知；但一點一滴的流血，可以致人死命，同樣，潛水艦戰的消敵耗人實力，也可以使敵人屈服。」這危險性敵方感到頭痛，開戰以來，關於應付潛水艦的對策，業已絞盡腦汁。其結果，出現了自去年末開始實施的新護送制。從北美經大西洋至英國本土，隨時隨地有飛機緊跟護衛着。這在英奐認爲『從基地到基地』的制度。對潛水艦戰上，大規模地開始實施飛機的護衛者，始自本年之初。這祗有飛機的大量生產及小型航空母艦的建造始有可能。</p>
<p>新護送制度的中心，正確地說，在於這小型航空母經而不在於飛機。最初護航團從北美出港的時候，由美加空軍所屬的本屈拉，哈特生，里倍萊得等新銳機從新芬蘭諾法斯科西亞附近，飛機根據地出發護衛，但離海岸九百餘公里之外即不能哨戒。同樣，從英海岸出動迎接的森特蘭，哈立發克斯，里倍萊得等飛機，亦祗限於上述的距離。於是大四洋正中的八百至九百五十公里這一段航程，乃是飛機護送上的一種間隙。塡充這間隙的是小型航空母艦的住務。護航團的配列如次：</p>
<p>商船位於護航團的正中，而附以小型航空母艦。在此之外，配以驅逐艦，驅潛艇及其他護送艦。在共外面，再附以第二列的護送艦。森特蘭加泰利亞級飛機時常從小型航空母艦飛出，擔任哨戒潛水艦的出現。</p>
<p>潛水艇攻防戰</p>
<p>潛水艦的防衛戰中，英美之技術的改良，例如改良護送驅逐艦。或驅　艦所備的方向探知機，以對抗薩伊蘭式潛艇，或利用海列科普達（垂直上昇機）以攻擊潛水艦等，亦須注意。總之，英美總動員生產力與技術力，今日已漸漸地脫離了潛水艦之致命的威脅，如其德國能想出制勝英美這護航制的新武器或新方法，則這種形勢很簡單地就要一變。但在目前，德國首先應該努力者，保持一天生產一艘不使間斷，第二。　其全力養成潛水艦員。這船員之大母補充的必要，現亦毋庸贅述。德國當局不久前聲稱：「我們現在已經想出了對抗英美護航船的新方法。」我們信賴這聲明，我們等待着英美在「大西洋之戰」中，重又悲呼「危機來了！」（翔：譯自八月二十五“四部朝日新聞。）</p>

<h3>雜糧戶口粉　今日起發售</h3>

<h3>流浪女兒的新社會母佑會女修院防問記一</h3>

<p>天主教母佑會中華區一會長和多理大姆　。一位充滿着愛人的熱情而有冷靜的頭腦　辦事　才的女宗敎家　談起母佑會的摩一史，令人悠然神往。</p>
<p>十九世紀，當歐洲各國工業革命之後，資本全義這怪物開始在世界橫行，使成千成萬的平民，被驅向工廠，留下子女，在窮街苦巷，無人照顧。這柳流浪子女，自幼失去受教養的機會。當孩子們的父母被絞榨盡了面汗，拖着疲乏的臭皮　，懷着滿腔怨憤而歸來，還會給孩子們些什麼天倫之樂呢？在這種社會與環境中，孩子們成　成鍆地死亡，流浪，以至爲非作歹，成爲國家社會的禍源，這種情形慢慢地蔓延了整個歐洲，傳到了　洲和亞洲以及其他許多地方。塡不滿這人世的缺陷，遍地是流浪兒的啼號！</p>
<p>那時有一位從貧苦流離中掙扎出來的前世紀義大利偉人聖若望鮑斯高神父，他來自流浪羣衆，深　流浪兒的苦痛；他更明瞭，在流浪兒中，　　着無　的天才，造成社會　限的損失，他不願自己的力量有限，「以貧救貧」，努力救濟流浪兒童，給以必要的教養，使脫離流浪的苦海，　見人類的博上新生的大道。從此養人的鮑斯高　幼會，不久更　佈到世界各國。</p>
<p>流浪兒中，女兒是最苦的了，還有許多孤兒苦女工的女孩子，她們求生的力量更為薄弱，因此情形更加凄慘，聖者望　斯高神父因此又另設女修院由女宗教家馬利亞馬濟靈主特，專力於流浪女兒的敎養事業，這是一千八百　十二年的事。那個女修善敎育事業，在使從前流浪無靠的貧苦女孩與女子，一　而為社會上良善有為的份子，殘廢者有所歸托，疾病者有所廖治。　引起社會人士的注意，獲的宣傳，慈善家的慷慨　助，而會祖母馬利亞馬　靈及會士更積極苦　，事業發達。初時只在義大利多利諾一地，不久即普及錢　，更達傳及歐美亞非各洲各國，差不多凡有天王敎慈幼會的地方，就一定也有母佑會的事業，近來在會修士已增至一萬二千餘名，女修院已有八百餘處了。</p>

<p>評言</p>
<h3>實踐決戰生活</h3>
<p>友邦日總領事當局，爲　日　澈底履行決戰生活起見，斷然實施限制酒類販賣時問：同時，市府布告，亦規定自昨日起，實行限制酒肆舞塲營業時間，並已勒令兩市閘北一帶烟賭塲所一律對閉，足見友邦與我國在同甘共苦的一個口號下，已不能再事優容粗界未曾收同以前之「飲食荒嬉」與「奢糜　　」的惡習，致令舉國上下不復知決戰生活爲何物。</p>
<p>決戰生活的要諦，在於舉圍上下能夠茹苦含辛，而其履行的條件，是要無時，無事，無物不講經濟；因此戰時生活，必須包括工作時間的延長，生產事業的推進，與物資消費的節約。酒樓，舞榭，烟窟，　塲是與決戰生活立於絕對相反地位的；時間之拋棄，事業之荒廢，物資之消耗而外，社會上一切作奸犯科，投機冒險，鮮廉寡恥的行爲，無一不可追源於此一類的塲合；是爲毒化戰時生活的因素，斷非戰時國家所能容忍。所以，我們切望當局本其已且之最大決心，努力擴大其肅淸毒紫運動。何謂擴大？例如，以賭塲而論，盡人都會問着：規模最宏偉。性質最公開，吸引最普邇的賭塲，是不是僅在南市與閑北？假定不是的話，那末，不管其現行組織爲如何冠冕堂皇，就應該一律加以封閉，以示澈底與大公。</p>
<h3>各業公會　展開調查工作　審核過去限價是否適合標準</h3>

<p>民意上達</p>
<h3>大上海市建設市民提供意見特輯之二</h3>
<p>貢獻於市政當局者</p>
<p>新上海誕生之初，百事待興，筆者願就直覺所看到的幾點，實獻於市政當局希望加以改良和興革，使市政　以「日新，日日新，又日新。」則市民幸甚焉。</p>
<p>拆除各鐵門</p>
<p>查鬥原爲舊租界當局敵視吾市區民衆而設，今租界既已收囘，自當一律加以拆除。如此，觀　方面，耳目爲之一新；而市區的繁榮，亦賴以發達。</p>
<p>政一元化</p>
<p>考前租界常局所　用之　員，其體格與高實，均有一定之標準，而服制亦整潔，一般均雄糾糾有武夫之概，待遇亦相當滿意。　其亦不免有一二令人有遺憾之處者，是即因向日受外人　染之關係，而所養成之一股——狐假虎威與奴視同胞——的惡習，及缺乏理智和善良的品性，以致如張案等不一其事，希望接收租界後的我警政當局，能注意到這一點，對於　員們施以適當的精神和理智的訓練；使成爲完美無缺的警政，同時舊市區警察，亦須汰弱留張，電整精神，而服制方面，亦須各區劃一，待遇更須平等。</p>
<p>路政與衛生</p>
<p>昔日租界當局，對於路政之舖築與修繕，推行不遺餘力。淸　夫終日忙碌街　之上，過行其淸潔之工作，以是居民殊蒙衛生之福利。年來雖因戰事之關係，遠不如戰前，然反顧舊市區之路政則不然，甚　今之市政當局，能一掃過去惡習，非唯須要維持現狀，使其不隳，更須厲進不已，向建設之途悉力以赴。</p>
<p>整頓捐稅</p>
<p>近世各國的捐稅，均着重於所得稅營　稅，及遺產稅。而今之另書捐直接加重消　　之負担。今後市政經費如不敷，不妨與財部協　開徵前租界當局所不能徵收之營業稅，所得稅，遺產稅等彌補之，此外如對於一般不法暴當者，課以相當巨大的暴富稅，雖多取之亦不爲　。至如地產溢價稅，更爲吾先總理昭昭之遺訓，徵之誰日不宜？</p>
<p>取締烟賭窟</p>
<p>煙　之為害，雖三尺稚童，亦知其之烈之酷。然以前南市，則竟有娛樂區之美稱，一般鄰近　　　窟之塲所，終日車水馬龍，電炬輒夜如畫。亟宜取締，餘如回力球塲及跑狗塲等，亦屬賭博之一，爲害不下煙賭，昔托租界之庇護，雖經輿論反對，亦無效果。今老，租界既已接收，對此害人之阱，自當毅然決然一例予以取締老也。</p>
<p>發展交通網</p>
<p>南北市區，昔日原有電車及公共汽車等股施，戰事爆發，破壞殆盡市民交通，幾全賴忠行，其限制市區之復興與繁榮，殊非淺鮮。愚意此事市府似宜興相關機關統籌協議，相機恢復。或先復一部，或先電車而後汽車，一視其簡而易舉者，先行恢復之，以利布民交通。且南北市交通一恢復，則一八兩區居民擁擠之現象，亦得和緩矣。</p>
<p>物資之配給</p>
<p>一般生活必需品，如肥皂，火柴　毛巾，布匹，鞋　，鹽油　酒等。均須作公正有效的分配，査糖，油，米及麵粉等雖早經計口配給，然從嚴說來尙朱臻完　；如不時脫期，或臨時減少等等不一而定，雖其原因，容不一端。然主共事者之不能盡忠厥職，要亦不容否認。而物資之分配、直接有關民衆的生存，間接則國家政府的生存，亦相與有關。是以政府委任配給物實的官吏，更　愼之又愼，以期收其實效。非僅一紙簡委之令，爲已盡能事。尤當　察某官某員之確能廉潔奉公盡忠職守者，始鄭重委之。</p>
<p>嚴行限價制</p>
<p>年來一般物價，均直綫上漲，此起彼　，毫無止境。不法商人，一唯私利之是圖，罔顧民生之艱難。前工部局及公董局雖有剴切諭告，時行厲禁，顧僅歛跡於一時，轉瞬故態復萌·推其原因，　為未曾置之重法。七月三十日市府已發表嚴禁超越限價之佈告，今後希望當局今出必行，違即嚴辦。如此當可使物價漸趨下跌，而民衆生活的嚴重威脅，亦可漸次解除矣雜望當局亟起圖之。</p>
<h3>建設新上海的幾個先決問題</h3>
<p>— 倪孝同</p>
<p>一，勿誤於人事中國既然已達到了接收和界的願望，那末今後種種市政設施，理應如何愼重將事，以期實現建設新上海的理想。事變後的市政機構，已經有了六年的歷史，不能再認爲是一個短促的時期了。可是市政設施的成就，是否達么了一般市民所期望的水準？是否達到了常局預其的目的，我認爲今後對于人事，應該一因事擇人」，切不可一因人　事。」過去一部份駢枝性的機關，無非是加重人民負担，現在新上海是在建設中，我們敢謂當局權衡「人」與「事」的輕重，前後，與緩急。</p>
<p>二，積極改造市民心理百年來，上海的市民，中了歐美化的毒，可說是太深了。聲色貨利，姻賭娼寮，使市民迷惑，沉醉。這種喪心病狂的現狀，現在終該有總結束的一日。歷史告訴我們，一國有一國的國格和國粹。上海市民，迷信歐美物質文明的心理，已經根深蒂固，對國家民族的意識，已因淡忘而入於麻木不仁的狀態。所以我們如果要達到把上海成爲全國政治，經濟，文化，敎育，治安等的模楷，那末非從改造民衆心理來着手不可。要改造民衆心理，筆者認爲非從復興我國固有的國格國粹不爲功。在此，筆者敢提出我國固有的文化，來作改造市民心理的初階</p>
<p>三，實行親民政策政府當局，假若要推行某種政策，只要確是造福於人民的，我們敢信人民必能站於贊助的立塲，進而顯在人力物力方面，對政府作更大的貢獻。已往官民　方應　成親愛精誠的德行。這就是說：爲政者對干人民，應視同赤子；而人民對爲政者，應敬如父兄，如此施政方能順利。</p>
<h3>澈底改造一下</h3>
<p>— 丁丁</p>
<p>旅滬二十載，欣逢租界收囘，百年恥辱，一洗而空，對市政建設，略陳固陋：</p>
<p>改良警政租界警政，在英美惡勢力下，士黑暗了，希望租界接收之今日，澈底改革一下。</p>
<p>停閉賭窟　一切不正當營業，都得勒令停閉，何况賭窟，當局未必不知，聞「最近將來」必予肅淸，何其迂且緩耶，此一</p>
<p>改善待遇公務人一員待遇太差，到一家數口，不易維持時，就雖免舞弊了。然生活指數，扶搖直上，枵腹從公，究有幾人，改善待遇，勢不容緩</p>
<p>建設南市南市閘北，一般悄形，相形見絀，租界收囘以後，希望一八兩區市政，更求精進；南市閘北滬西浦束，積極建設，整飭市容。</p>
<h3>供給精神食糧設立大圖書館</h3>
<p>— 沈鳳威</p>
<p>精神食糧與物質食糧，對於上海市民同感需要。精神食糧普遍供應一事，除振興出版事業以外，圖書館則尤爲得力矣：出版物既高昻不堪，圖書館遂益形切要。然上海現存諸圖書館是否足以担負廣施精神食糧之使命，殊屬疑問。據予所知，上海今日唯福州路前工部局圖書館一所乃公立之獨立圖書館，此外均係私立或屬機關團體附設。而舊工部局圖書館所藏，以英文書爲多，中文書籍甚少，供普通參考之用亦患不足，而英文書籍中獨多通俗小說，學術參考書亦未足用也；至于入館閱覽必須付款覓保，手續麻煩，未爲一理想讀書之所。其他私立或機關附設各館，如四川路近代科學圖書館則全部日文書籍籍慈淑大樓之新亞圖書館水準太低，借閱辦法亦欠完善；鴻英，震旦，海關各館蒐藏雖較豐，但入館手續麻煩，或須繳費，均不能以應一般市民之需也。是故，成立一較為大規模之市立圖書顧似甚必要。</p>
<p>夫大都市之需要一大規模圖書館，是爲理所當然；然對今日之上海則尤迫要。蓋一般市民于生活高壓之下均已無力購買書籍，必有一圖書館以解此精神食糧之饑饉餓也。</p>
<h3>禁絕索取租屋小費</h3>
<p>— 吳承樑</p>
<p>解決新上海住的問題</p>
<p>住乃是人生中不可缺乏的一個最大問題。在大東亞戰爭爆發前，繁榮的滬埠，人口稠密的雲集，其時房子求過於供，一般二房東見於房屋市値之需，竟不顧公衆，僅求個人坐收獲利。頓時將租金私自抬高。一加再加，幾使居伴的房客難以勝負。</p>
<p>當局爲防止租金逐加起見，前曾專事設辦二房東登記事宜，（現仍依然繼總着）規定二房東之租費收入，共利以不得超過百分之二卞爲限，否則得加以處罰，此乃對於一般之黑心二房東的一個常頭棒，當時頓見其效。</p>
<p>但近來一般二房東見於無利可圖，乃改變方針，從收取所謂「小費」着手，當一三房客初次進屋時，除按月規定租金外。另須出小費若干，感於往昔二房東和與三房客之房屋，除按月租金外絕無所謂此種之「小費」，其「小費」之高低係視其地段之熱鬧，與房屋之大小而定，此確是現在滬埠市民所無可否認的一個事實。</p>
<p>近來更有一般黑心二房東竟以藉口房子收囘自用爲要挾，將原居之房客一迫限令期遷出，轉手問再將原屋韓租於他人，這樣又可獲得一筆鉅額之小費也。</p>
<p>現適値租界接收大上海歸爲一元化之際，並當局正在從事着手辦理建設與改善事宜，關於二房東與三房客間之索取小費一事，實有急待嚴禁的必要</p>
<h3>寶貴的建議（二）</h3>
<p>徐右君大上海新生建設計畫之顯望闡述衣食足而後知榮辱，分一，衣着問題，希望配給，二，食糧問題，希望增加，三，住的問題，希望「安居」，四　行的問題，交通聯貫。</p>
<p>蘇達君上海中心公園創設芻議內容主於跑馬廳闢爲中心公圜，劃分三區，以四分之二作公園，附設運動塲，民衆教育館，演講廳，俱樂部等。</p>
<p>張一冲君對於上海施政之希望一，根絕烟賭，二，肅淸乞丐，三拆除危險建築物，四建平民住宅，五普設習藝所。</p>

        <h1>1943.09.02</h1>
<h3>International New Situation and East Asia</h3>
<p>More than a week has passed since Roosevelt and Churchill concluded their meeting in Quebec, and the situation in Europe is still undergoing subtle evolutions. Militarily, since the shift of Axis forces in Sicily and Kharkov, both sides are preparing for the second phase of the war. The center of gravity of the Eastern Front is moving south, with the Soviet army clearly advancing into the heart of Ukraine, especially vying for control of the Black Sea. Because if these two moves are secured, they are prerequisites for dominating the Balkan Peninsula. However, here it will encounter not only the German military's steel hammer but also the Anglo-American iron tongs. That is to say, there will be not only military but also political resistance.</p>
<p>Secondly, on the Western Front, the retreat of Axis forces from Sicily has created a new situation, which is not the continued advance of the Anglo-American forces, but the consolidation of the Axis forces' defense capabilities in Italy. Undoubtedly, the lull in the fighting is what the Axis forces hope for. The more days the Anglo-Americans hesitate, the more days the Axis forces have to prepare. However, to blame the Anglo-Americans for not opening a second front in the west, as the Soviet Union does, is somewhat impatient and morbid, because the Anglo-Americans are planning for their own hegemony, not for the Soviet Union. Their ambition also lies in the struggle for the Balkans; they are even more afraid of being communized. Thus, the Western Front has fallen into a temporary lull again, and the troops in North Africa and the Mediterranean are stirring. There are even rumors of a shift eastward.</p>
<p>The contradictions in the strategies of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union caused the much-anticipated Quebec Conference to end with an unnatural announcement. The focus of the contradiction is definitely not the issue of Europe first or the Pacific first, as claimed in their communique, but only the location, timing, and strategic issues of the so-called second battlefield. In terms of location, although the Soviet government has never made any public statement, its newspapers and magazines have published strategic articles by well-known military commentators. They do not recognize the battles in North Africa and Sicily as the second front, and even deny in advance that the attack on mainland Italy is the second front. They believe that only an offensive centered on London, towards France, Belgium, the Netherlands, or Denmark, is the most ideal second front, paying particular attention to the direction of the offensive across the not-very-wide English Channel. But Britain does not recognize these, and they believe that it is best to advance towards the Balkans. As for strategy, the Soviet side has repeatedly stated that indiscriminate bombing from the air cannot determine the outcome of the war and that an invasion of the mainland is necessary; the Anglo-Americans, on the contrary, believe that a large-scale advance is only possible if it is towards the Balkans. In terms of timing, the Soviet Union advocates opening the Western Front immediately, while the Anglo-Americans believe that mainland operations cannot be spoken of rashly until next year.</p>
<p>We should point out that, to this day, the contradictions between the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union are indeed trending towards intensification. However, they are still limited to the above-mentioned political and strategic conflicts. There has been no complete rift in the overall operational policy. Therefore, to declare the breakdown of the three-nation relationship when the Soviet Union withdrew Maisky and Litvinov is premature. Today, it is only natural for the United States and Britain to begin guarding against the Soviet Union, and it is also inevitable for the Soviet Union to use the summer offensive to conduct communist diplomacy. However, given Britain's own weakness and the United States' concerns about being attacked on both the eastern and western fronts, it is clear that the masters of Downing Street and the White House today have no choice but to accommodate the Soviet Union. Eden hurriedly tracked Maisky to London in Cairo, and Davis also rushed to participate in the Eden-Maisky talks. Under the pressure of the overall situation, the contradictions between the anti-Axis countries seem to be finding a temporary compromise. Therefore, the Axis countries' warriors should not focus their attention on the contradictions between the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. Instead, they must raise their vigilance, use the enemy's contradictions to buy time, and prepare for the decisive battle.</p>
<p>In the communique of the Quebec Conference, which was hastily released during the development of the contradictions between the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, it was actually declared that the focus of this meeting was to discuss a "major counter-offensive in the Pacific." Anyone with a little common sense knows that this is a new type of diplomatic rhetoric, because if you really want to do something, no one would disclose their strategy to the other party! However, we cannot completely ignore the meaning behind this announcement. First, this announcement by the United States and Britain can, to some extent, appease the Soviet Union's anger at the United States and Britain's delay in opening a second front, and pave the way for opening up new channels for three-party negotiations. Second, at a time when the fighting power of the Chongqing side is weakening and the fighting spirit is declining, this announcement can, to some extent, dispel some pessimistic and disappointed emotions. Third, the rainy season in Myanmar is about to end, and the Japanese army may break through the gates of India at any time. Chandra Bose is leading the Indian Independence Army, preparing to fight for the restoration of India. The hearts of the Indian people are restless. This declaration also contains the effect of frightening and suppressing India.</p>
<p>In fact, the so-called counter-offensive in the Pacific by the United States has been constantly attempted since last autumn. However, in addition to the sacrifices of the fleet and air force, it is still confined between the gates of Australia, and has not been able to cross the Solomon Islands and New Guinea. Especially today, with the military assistance of friendly Japan's diplomatic and political battles, the gradual realization of our country's sovereign integrity, the restoration of Thailand's homeland, the success of Burma's independence, the participation of East Indian natives in politics, the preparation for the independence of the Philippines, and cooperation in the Indian national liberation movement, all of these facts are the greatest guarantee for the stability of the Greater East Asia situation. The support of the people's hearts is truly what is meant by "the three armies can be deprived of their commander, but a common man cannot be deprived of his will." Even if the United States plots a counter-offensive by force, can it break the unity of the East Asian nations today? Although, with the United States' years of operation of the Alaskan Highway, its war preparations for the Aleutian Islands, its recent military activities in India, and its use of Chongqing's air force bases, we cannot underestimate the activities of these forces. Eliminating the idea of complacency, boosting the fighting spirit, uniting the 1.1 billion compatriots of Asia, sacrificing and struggling, and striving for the victory of the East Asian national liberation war should be our highest goal today.</p>

<h3>Japanese Foreign Ministry Decides to Send Kawasoe to China for Investigation; Ugaki Succeeds as Chief of Staff of the China Fleet</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) - Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu is very concerned about the situation in China after Japan implemented its new policy. In addition to maintaining close contact with Japanese agencies in China, he sent Ishizaki, former ambassador to Brazil in charge of the Foreign Ministry's War Affairs Investigation Office, to China in June to investigate for a month. He has now decided to entrust Tatsuo Kawasoe, former minister to Australia, to go to various parts of China for investigation and to collect and prepare information. It is reported that Kawasoe is scheduled to depart for China on the 3rd with Kondo, an official of the Sixth Political Affairs Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) - According to a statement issued by the Japanese Ministry of the Army: Vice Admiral Kanji Ugaki has been appointed as Chief of Staff of the China Fleet on the 1st. It is reported that Vice Admiral Ugaki Kanji is the nephew of General Kazushige Ugaki.

<h3>The Central Government Solemnly Commemorates the Martyrs Who Sacrificed Themselves for the Peace Movement; Chairman Wang Reports on the Significance of Commemorating the Martyrs</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 1st (Central News Agency) - September 1st is the Commemoration Day for the Martyrs of the Peace Movement. In addition to flying flags at half-mast to express grief, the central government held a solemn Commemoration Ceremony for the Martyrs of the Peace Movement in the Grand Auditorium of the National Government at 9:00 a.m. today. Present were the heads of the various departments, ministries, commissions, and agencies of the National Government, as well as the members of the Executive and Supervisory Committees of the Central Party Headquarters. On the rostrum were the national flag and the portrait of the founding father of the nation, and there was a shared table. On the shared table were the spirit tablets and flower baskets of the martyrs of the Peace Movement. Flowers were placed in front of the stage, creating a solemn and dignified atmosphere. At 9:00 a.m. sharp, the solemn ceremony began. After the Chairman took his seat, everyone stood at attention and sang the national anthem in unison. Then, they paid the highest respects to the national flag and the portrait of the founding father of the nation. After the Chairman respectfully read the will of the founding father of the nation, he led everyone in bowing to the spirit tablets of the martyrs of the Peace Movement to express their condolences and observed a moment of silence to express their grief, and respectfully presented flower wreaths. At that moment, mournful music was played in unison, and the auditorium was filled with a solemn atmosphere. After the music stopped, the Chairman reported on the significance of commemorating the martyrs of the Peace Movement. Xu Wenguan read the speech on his behalf, and the words were poignant, inspiring the entire audience. Finally, the Commemoration Song of the Martyrs of the Peace Movement was played. At about 11:00 a.m., this solemn ceremony ended in mournful music.</p>
<p>Original Text of Chairman Wang's Speech, Nanjing, 1st (Central News Agency) - At 9:00 a.m. this morning, the central government held the Commemoration Ceremony for the Martyrs of the Peace Movement in the Grand Auditorium of the National Government. Chairman Wang led the officials from various departments, ministries, and commissions in holding the ceremony and delivered a speech. Because the Chairman had a slight stomachache and sore throat, he asked Chief Secretary Xu Wen to read the speech on his behalf. The full text of the original speech is as follows:</p>
<p>Since the first National Commemoration Meeting for the Martyrs of the Peace Movement was held on this day in the 29th year of the Republic, today is the fourth time. Recalling the past, examining the present, and looking forward to the future, I feel very excited in addition to grief.</p>
<p>The martyrs of the Peace Movement devoted their hearts and souls to the Peace Movement, and then gave their lives for it. They based their actions on the highest ideal and the strongest belief, using them as the guiding principles. What are these ideals and beliefs? They are the founding father of the nation's Great Asianism. The martyrs of the Peace Movement knew that there was no other way to revive China and revive East Asia. To realize Great Asianism, China must work hard itself. Because if China cannot work hard to achieve independence and freedom, it will not be qualified to share the responsibility of East Asia. At the same time, in addition to its own efforts, China must also cooperate with Japan. Because Japan is an advanced country in East Asia, China must stand on the same line with Japan and move in the same direction. Even if disputes arise temporarily due to inconsistent military and diplomatic policies, efforts must be made to improve the situation so that they can jointly deal with the enemies who invade East Asia, the British and American imperialists.</p>
<p>The above is the noble ideal and firm belief shared by every martyr. At the beginning of the Peace Movement, the people of the country could not understand this ideal and belief, and therefore encountered many hardships. As a result, many martyrs sacrificed themselves. The comrades who died later followed in the blood-stained footsteps of the martyrs and continued to struggle, moving forward step by step. On January 9th of this year, China participated in the Greater East Asia War, which means that China and Japan are already standing on the same line and are moving forward hand in hand in the same direction. This is what patriots of the two countries have been seeking day and night for decades. Having achieved it today, we are willing to comfort the spirits of the martyrs of the Peace Movement with the utmost sincerity and respect.</p>
<p>At the same time, in order to fulfill its promise to assist China in achieving independence, friendly Japan signed an agreement with China on January 9th of this year, returning the concessions ahead of schedule and abolishing extraterritoriality. By August 1st, there were no more concessions in the entire country, and the abolition of extraterritoriality had also begun. Reviving China and reviving East Asia are one and the same thing, which is further proof of this. Today, we are willing to comfort the spirits of the martyrs of the Peace Movement with the utmost sincerity and respect.</p>
<p>The hardships and obstacles of the past were fully experienced by the martyrs of the Peace Movement, who sacrificed themselves one after another and still illuminate us with their spiritual light, allowing us to be encouraged to move forward. Our hearts are connected to the hearts of the martyrs of the Peace Movement from afar, without a moment of interruption. Today, the understanding of peace among the people is gradually becoming widespread, and the number of troops returning is also gradually increasing. We believe that overall peace will be realized sooner or later, and the victory of the Greater East Asia War will be achieved sooner or later. We can only follow the road illuminated by the martyrs of the Peace Movement with a spirit of perseverance, hard work, courage, and diligence, and move forward.</p>

<h3>Chairman Wang Declares for the Government's Purchase of Yarn and Cloth; Deadline for Applying for Sale is Approaching</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 1st (Central News Agency) - In order to alleviate the difficulties of merchants, the National Government previously approved the supplementary registration of cotton yarn and cloth at the 174th meeting of the Executive Yuan, with a deadline of the 15th. After the deadline, the goods will be confiscated according to law. The Executive Yuan ordered the National Commercial Control Council to comply with the order. After receiving the order, the Commercial Control Council issued a notice through the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Purchasing Office, setting August 27th as the starting date for the work and handling the supplementary registration, and in accordance with the order of the Executive Yuan, decided to close the registration on September 6th, with no further extension. Now that the deadline is approaching, Wang Jian, concurrently President of the Executive Yuan, issued a second statement to reiterate the government's determination to purchase cotton yarn and cloth, as follows:</p>
<p>On the 9th of last month, the government decided to purchase cotton yarn and cloth, purely for the purpose of suppressing prices and stabilizing the people's livelihood. The interests of legitimate holders of cotton yarn and cloth have also been taken into account. In addition to setting a price, the key points of the statement issued by the head of the purchasing office are as follows: At that time, the black market price of 20-count yarn was as high as 40,000 yuan per package, and other yarns and cloths were similar. It was impossible for ordinary people to buy a bolt of cotton cloth at the official price. The hardship can be imagined. Because of this, cotton yarn and cloth were no longer daily necessities for the people, but were used by speculators. Production stagnated and the economic situation became precarious. The government has long wanted to implement a purchase policy, but the only consideration is that if a large amount of national currency is used for the purchase, there will inevitably be a panic of currency inflation in the market. Fortunately, friendly Japan, in view of this difficulty, provided strong assistance, and it was decided to use half gold and half national currency for the purchase. In this way, the panic of currency inflation can be avoided, and the merchants will benefit more from receiving gold. The price of 10,000 yuan for 20-count yarn may seem too low, but it should be known that the 40,000 yuan in the black market is actually an illegitimate profit, which is difficult to satisfy. At that time, the black market price of each tael of gold was as high as 120,000 yuan. Now, the program has decided that each tael of ten taels is only 40,000 yuan, which means that the price of 10,000 yuan for 20-count yarn is actually higher than 10,000 yuan. Perhaps merchants have insufficient capital and find it difficult to make deliveries in installments. It should be known that if deliveries are not made in installments, the drawbacks of currency inflation will still be difficult to avoid, and the public interest must be taken as the priority. Or it may be feared that the government will abuse the cotton yarn and cloth after purchasing it. It should be known that the government is implementing this policy for the sake of economic revival, using it domestically to purchase food, cotton, and other industrial raw materials, and externally following the principle of barter trade to obtain soybeans, rice, and other grains. In this way, the people's food can be adjusted, and agriculture and industry can be revitalized, which is of great significance. Based on the above, it can be seen that the policy of purchasing cotton yarn and cloth is related to the national interest and the people's welfare. The government will implement it quickly and effectively with the greatest determination. A supplementary registration of cotton yarn and cloth has been carried out to alleviate the difficulties of merchants, with a deadline of the 15th, which will end on the 6th of this month. A special telegram was sent to the National Commercial Control Council on that day, reiterating the determination not to extend the deadline. The deadline for applying to sell cotton cloth is also the 6th of this month. It is heard that some people are still taking a wait-and-see attitude, hoping for another extension. This is actually due to insufficient understanding. Therefore, I solemnly declare that I hope that our merchants will take the overall situation as the priority, abandon personal opinions, assist the government in implementing the policy, and handle the application for sale procedures before the 6th of this month. Do not think that there is still a possibility of extension, so as not to harm yourself and the overall situation. Concurrently, President of the Executive Yuan Wang Zhaoming.</p>

<h3>Fierce Air Battle Over Bogenville; Half of 50 Enemy Aircraft Lost</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) - On the 30th, the enemy forces in the Solomon Islands used a combined formation of approximately 50 fighter-bombers to attack the eastern end of Bogenville Island. The Japanese naval fighter squadron immediately intercepted them, and a fierce air battle ensued.

<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 6:15 p.m. on the 1st that multiple enemy aircraft attacked Minami-Tori Island (formerly known as Marcus Island) at dawn today, and enemy ships also shelled the land.</p>
<h3>Situation Extremely Tense on Various Parts of the Eastern European Front; German Army Conducts Effective Defensive Warfare</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 1st (Central News Agency) - After the German army withdrew from important strongholds such as Kharkov, Afgulga, and Taigandrog, the situation in the southern region of the Eastern Front became tense. Taking advantage of the German army's shortening of the front line, the Soviet army launched major offensives west of Kursk in Sefsk and west of Vyazma. Currently, they are repeatedly attacking the new German defense lines in Smolensk, Bryansk, Poltava, Krasnodar, Stalingrad, and Mavepo, engaging in fierce battles with the German army. The Soviet Union's war report on the 31st stated that the Soviet army in the Smolensk area broke through part of the enemy's defense line and occupied Yermovo, an important transportation hub 45 kilometers east of Smolensk, on the 31st, and continued to attack west and southwest of Kharkov. According to German news reports, the German side stated that the German army was conducting an effective defensive war against the superior Soviet army on the entire line, so it is still unclear where the Soviet army has advanced. According to a United Press International report from Moscow, the Soviet army in the Sefsk area had advanced 60 miles west of Kursk to Rylsk and Glukhiv on the 30th, penetrating northern Ukraine. It was also said that the German army's counter-offensive west and southwest of Kharkov was extremely fierce, preventing the Soviet army from advancing. The Soviet army in the Stalingrad area had great difficulty in breaking through the German army's meticulous defenses.</p>
<p>Germany Concentrates Large Forces to Reinforce Coastal Areas</p>
<p>Berlin, 1st (Central News Agency) - The German military authorities stated that in order to conserve manpower, the German army on the Eastern Front sometimes makes regional advances. Therefore, the German command was able to concentrate its forces in other parts of Europe, guarding against all unforeseen events in the coastal areas of Europe. However, this does not mean withdrawing forces from the Eastern Front. Rather, a large portion of the newly formed elite units within Germany over the past six months were transported to the Eastern Front and deployed in various parts of the European continent. Moreover, these units are highly mechanized and can be transported to the Eastern Front immediately if necessary. Therefore, the German command can successfully conduct defensive warfare with just the reserves on the Eastern Front and does not need assistance from Western Europe. Therefore, the success of the German army's defensive war on the Eastern Front further increases its importance.</p>
<h3>Churchill Delivers Broadcast Speech in Quebec; Strongly Advocates Convening a Three-Nation Conference</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina, 1st (Central News Agency) - British Prime Minister Churchill gave a broadcast speech to the world in Quebec on the evening of the 31st of last month, focusing on pleasing the Soviet Union and Stalin throughout. In his broadcast, he strongly advocated holding a meeting of the foreign ministers of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. The gist of his speech is as follows: The Quebec Conference was mostly focused on strengthening the war against Japan. However, since the Soviet government still has a neutrality treaty with the Japanese government, the British and American governments have not yet decided whether to invite Chairman Stalin to the meeting. However, holding a three-person meeting with Chairman Stalin is what President Roosevelt and I urgently hope for. The fact that a three-person meeting has not been held in the past is by no means because the British and American governments have not made every effort. Rather, it is because Chairman Stalin must personally direct the Soviet army's operations on the Eastern Front and cannot easily leave his country. However, President Roosevelt and I both believe that not only should a meeting of the foreign ministers of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union be convened to review various important issues, but also a meeting of the heads of the three countries is necessary. Moreover, it is absolutely necessary to make the opinions of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union increasingly consistent. Churchill also mentioned the Soviet Union's request to establish a second front, saying that the Soviets had asked the British and American governments to shoulder half of the burden. They were angered and dissatisfied and criticized the fact that the second front had not yet been established, and I did not make any accusations against the Soviet Union. In addition, he said that, apart from the second front, the North African campaign would inevitably be regarded as an extremely treacherous campaign. The American, Australian, and New Zealand armies were fighting the Japanese army in the Pacific, but the important task in the Indian theater would be borne by the British army. The joint operations command composed of the naval, land, and air forces of the British and American armies would definitely achieve its intended purpose. Finally, Churchill said that he was considering it and predicted that the air offensive against Germany would be intensified in the coming days, but he refused to predict the end date of the war, as such speculative speculation was of no benefit to the war effort.</p>
<p>Maisky and Eden Held Another Long Talk Yesterday</p>
<p>Lisbon, 31st (Central News Agency) - According to reports from London, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Maisky, who was in London to bid farewell to the British government, had a long talk with British Foreign Secretary Eden yesterday. It is believed that this was related to the results of the Quebec Conference and preparations for a three-party conference to be held in London or Moscow. Maisky returned to London on Saturday evening and had a private meeting with Eden once before making an official visit yesterday.</p>
<h3>Resignation of the Danish Government to the King; Failure of Indirect Strategy between Britain and America</h3>
<p>Berlin, Central News Agency, 1st – According to a report from the Hutung News Agency: Well-informed sources here confirmed yesterday that the Danish government has submitted its resignation to King Christian. The Danish government has instructed all officials to continue performing their duties as usual for the sake of the nation’s interests. There is currently no need to establish military tribunals based on martial law. The German special envoy, Best, is still in Denmark. Regarding the recent unrest in Denmark, the Foreign Ministry is paying close attention to the British side’s statements and the response from British authorities concerning whether British or Danish paratroopers landed in Denmark. The response stated that the matter concerns military affairs and must be kept secret. Based on this, the British side’s refusal to clarify is tantamount to acknowledging that foreign secret agents are indirectly or directly responsible for the unrest in Denmark. On August 28, a spokesman for the BBC, Lesay, made a similar admission, saying that the recent increase in strikes in Denmark was due to the help of British paratroopers. The London "Star" also said that the outbreak of assistance to Denmark was still premature. The BBC spokesman later added that the recent unrest in Denmark was almost the first link in the chain of a planned uprising in the German-occupied territories, and the date of its launch was set by the Allied Command. German Foreign Ministry officials continued that the Danish incident was indeed premature, and the German authorities were able to thwart the Allied plan in time. People here believe that this plan is the "indirect strategy" advocated by the "Daily Telegraph" on August 30. Its purpose is as follows: to intimidate civilians; Britain wants to carry out its traditional policy of enticing people from other countries to fight for it; and to incite people to disregard danger and take hostile actions against the occupying authorities.</p>
<h3>New Situation in the Atlantic War: Improvement in Submarine Defense Warfare</h3>
<p>According to recent joint announcements by the British and American sides, the number of German submarines sunk by Britain and America between May, June, and July was described as "the best record since the beginning of the war." According to their announcement, the number of British and American ships sunk by submarines in the eight months since January of this year has decreased by one-half compared to the second half of last year, and by one-quarter compared to the first half. Another enemy propaganda claim stated that 2,500 ships were used in the Sicilian landing campaign in the Atlantic and Mediterranean, of which only one million tons were sunk by submarines. British and American authorities are jubilantly saying, "The greatest threat from enemy submarines has now been lifted. The surge in ship production this year is expected to exceed the number of sinkings."</p>
<p>Of course, their propaganda cannot be fully trusted. However, in the "Atlantic War," German submarines are considered to be temporarily in a difficult battle, and in recent months, they have not been as active as before. This is often pointed out by German naval personnel themselves. So, where does this difficult battle come from?</p>
<p>New Convoy System</p>
<p>Simply put, it is because the enemy has strengthened air attacks. Currently, the German army is being forced into a difficult battle in the British and American bombing of Germany, on the Mediterranean front, and on the Eastern front. The biggest reason for this seems to be aircraft, and the new situation in the "Atlantic War" now also seems to be due to aircraft. In any case, submarine warfare is ultimately one of Germany's greatest weapons. German Navy Commander-in-Chief Dönitz said at a banquet this spring: "That (referring to submarine warfare) may not have immediate effects, but it is unknowable; but a little bit of bleeding can lead to death. Similarly, submarine warfare can reduce the enemy's strength and make the enemy surrender." The enemy feels a headache about this danger, and since the beginning of the war, they have racked their brains for countermeasures to deal with submarines. As a result, a new escort system that began to be implemented at the end of last year has emerged. From North America across the Atlantic to the British mainland, aircraft closely escort at any time and any place. This is considered by the British as a 'base-to-base' system. Large-scale implementation of aircraft escort on submarine warfare began at the beginning of this year. This is only possible with the mass production of aircraft and the construction of small aircraft carriers.</p>
<p>The core of the new escort system, correctly speaking, lies in these small aircraft carriers rather than aircraft. When the initial convoy departed from North America, it was escorted by new aircraft such as the Ventura, Hudson, and Liberator belonging to the US and Canadian Air Forces from the aircraft base near Nova Scotia, but they could not patrol beyond 900 kilometers from the coast. Similarly, the Sunderland, Halifax, and Liberator aircraft dispatched from the British coast to meet them are also limited to the above-mentioned distance. Thus, the 800 to 950 kilometer section in the middle of the Atlantic is a kind of gap in air escort. Filling this gap is the job of small aircraft carriers. The arrangement of the convoy is as follows:</p>
<p>Merchant ships are located in the center of the convoy, with a small aircraft carrier attached. Outside of this, destroyers, submarine chasers, and other escort ships are assigned. Outside of them, a second row of escort ships is attached. Sunderland Catalina-class aircraft often fly from small aircraft carriers to patrol for the appearance of submarines.</p>
<p>Submarine Offensive and Defensive Warfare</p>
<p>In the defensive warfare of submarines, attention must also be paid to the technological improvements of Britain and America, such as the improvement of escort destroyers, or the direction-finding equipment equipped by destroyers to counter Saaland-style submarines, or the use of helicopters (vertical take-off aircraft) to attack submarines, etc. In short, the British and American total mobilization of productivity and technological power have gradually escaped the fatal threat of submarines today. If Germany can come up with a new weapon or new method to defeat this British and American escort system, then this situation will simply change. But at present, what Germany should strive for first is to maintain the production of one ship a day without interruption, and second, to do its best to train submarine crew members. There is no need to elaborate on the necessity of greatly supplementing these crew members now. The German authorities recently claimed: "We have now come up with new methods to counter British and American escort ships." We trust this statement, and we are waiting for Britain and America to once again cry out "Crisis is coming!" in the "Atlantic War!" (Xiang: Translated from the August 25 "Asahi Shimbun".)</p>

When manufacturing plants and processing plants need to be allocated, they should be moved out of the warehouse designated by the association. The reporter has learned that the Business Control Committee has temporarily decided on two types of movement certificates for the transportation of yarn and cloth for purchase, in order to facilitate inspection. Once the certificates are printed, they will be sent to the relevant agencies in the city, ordering them to be informed, in order to facilitate the process.</p>
<p>Instructions for Filling Out the Actual Number Report</p>
<p>The Purchase of Cotton Yarn and Cloth Office has stipulated and announced the instructions for filling out the actual number report, which are copied below:</p>
<p>Report on the actual number of retail sales (A); Retailers' report on the actual number of sales (Form No. 5 A) is the application form for shops, cotton yarn and cloth retailers. Cotton yarn and cloth retailers refer to those who sell cotton yarn and cloth directly to consumers at the store, but wholesalers who have a part of their stock in the store for retail sales should also be regarded as retail sales. Matters that should be noted on the retail sales actual number report: (1) Purchases by military officers and public officials are not regarded as retail sales. (2) Sales between retailers are not regarded as retail sales. (3) When entrusted to sell, if the trustee is responsible and plans the commission, it should be calculated based on the actual number of the trustee. If the entruster is responsible and allows the trustee to rent a shop, it should be calculated based on the actual number of the entruster. (4) The amount of the goods that the applicant hopes to be exempt from purchase, such as the amount entered in the "Applicant's hope to exempt from purchase" column on the store application form, shall not exceed the average monthly amount of retail sales in the first half of this year.</p>
<p>Report on the actual number of manufacturing and processing (B); Manufacturing and processing enterprises use the actual number report form (i.e., the factory application form). Manufacturing and processing enterprises refer to those who have their own factories, obtain raw materials based on their own calculations, and manufacture and process in their own factories. However, those who manufacture or process on behalf of others are not regarded as manufacturing and processing enterprises here, but if a part is processed and manufactured on behalf of others, and another part is processed and manufactured on their own calculations, that part can be regarded as a manufacturing and processing enterprise. The amount of the goods that the applicant hopes to be exempt from purchase, such as the amount entered in the "Applicant's hope to exempt from purchase" column on the back of the factory application form, shall not exceed the average monthly amount of use in the first half of this year.</p>
<p>Cotton Will Be on the Market, Prepare to Buy</p>
<p>The Business Control Committee believes that cotton will soon be on the market in the current autumn season, and all purchasing matters should be prepared as soon as possible. It is learned that the committee has ordered the Cotton Industry Expert Committee to revise the previously drafted methods in detail in light of the current situation and send them to the committee for review and implementation. It is learned that the Cotton Industry Expert Committee is currently actively revising the methods for purchasing cotton in order to obtain approval for implementation as soon as possible, so that production raw materials can be increased to enrich people's livelihood.</p>
<h3>Cigarette Wholesalers Held a Meeting Yesterday to Request Improvement in Allocation</h3>

More than 20 representatives were selected to contact the allocation authorities to discuss various allocation issues.</p>
<h3>Authorities Promote Transportation and Sanitation Facilities</h3>
<p>Since the unification of the municipal administration, the relevant authorities in this port have obtained mutual contact and jointly cooperated in local construction. According to a report by the Datong News Agency, the matters being planned and handled include the following: Expanding the scope of connected ditches to eliminate the current situation of local waterproofing and widely setting up waterproof seats; constructing roads on a large scale; making public transportation as developed as possible; unifying sanitation organizations; and actively burying exposed coffins and corpses in the suburbs.</p>
<h3>Nanshi Held Secret Inspection of Pedestrians</h3>
<p>In order to ensure local security in the area, the Nanshi police and military authorities held a secret inspection of pedestrians exercise yesterday morning. From morning to noon, plainclothes police and military personnel were stationed at each iron gate connected to the Eighth District to carry out inspection tasks on passing pedestrians and vehicles. The results were very satisfactory. It is heard that in the future, inspections will be carried out at any time, regardless of the area or time, so that bandits can be eradicated in Nanshi.</p>
<h3>This Newspaper Resumes Publication of the Shenbao Weekly; Free Talk is Transferred to the Monthly; Baimao is Transferred to the Weekly; Announcement</h3>
<p>The Shenbao Weekly, which has been suspended for six years, will resume publication in September.

In addition, literature can adjust interests and inspire thoughts, so we will transfer the Baimao Weekly of this newspaper here.</p>
<p>Free Talk has a long history and has been loved by readers.

<h3>Miscellaneous Grain Household Powder on Sale Starting Today</h3>
<p>Change of Operation Agency for Household Rice; Business Control Association and Municipal Business Association in Consultation</p>
<p>Datong News Agency reported: Rice shops in the 182 district obtained miscellaneous grain sales orders from the Rice and Flour Allocation Section yesterday, and have exchanged them for warehouse orders. They are picking up goods from Shunfeng, Hengkang, Hengyi, Huang Changshun, and other rice mills. They can be sold universally today. Each person can purchase half a liter of barley, sorghum, naked barley, red grain, or corn with the second ticket of the miscellaneous grain purchase certificate, paying a price of two yuan in Central Reserve Bank coupons. The household powder for the 46th period is all No. 2 flour, designated to be picked up from the Yuxin Second Factory on West Suzhou Road and the Fufeng Factory on Moganshan Road. It has been on sale since today. One and a half catties can be purchased with the 46th period flour purchase certificate, paying a price of ten yuan and five jiao in Central Reserve Bank coupons. As for the household rice for the 46th period, due to the change of the rice and grain operation agency, the Business Control Association and the Municipal Business Association are in consultation on the transportation method. With the cooperation of reputable people, the food problem of the city can be restored to normal.</p>
<p>Rice and Grain Joint Venture Company to Be Dissolved; After the Sixth Materials Control Review Committee decided to transfer the rice and grain purchase agency and assign all matters related to rice and grain purchase to the food special agency organized by the Business Control Association, the current Rice and Grain Joint Venture Company will be dissolved. After the approval of the Executive Yuan meeting, a clear order will be issued. The Commercial News Agency learned from relevant parties that at the beginning of the organization of the Rice and Grain Joint Venture Company, the relevant authorities originally intended to entrust the company with full power over food purchases. However, after the organization was established, the company, on the one hand, was unable to undertake this major mission due to its own capabilities, and on the other hand, the joint ventures in various places encountered resistance in purchasing and were unable to advance their work according to plan. At the same time, due to the backward culture of Chinese businessmen and the lack of unity, the organization of joint ventures in various places was unsound. For these various reasons, the organization of the Rice and Grain Joint Venture Company was reduced to a formality. The Materials Control Review Committee, in view of this, decided to place all the powers of food purchase and allocation with the Business Control Association and organize a specialized agency to handle it. As for the Southern Control Association's organization of a food special agency, it will generally follow the organization of professional committees such as flour, wheat, and cotton, absorbing Chinese and Japanese businessmen to make them one piece. The person in charge of this special agency is said to have been internally designated as Yuan Ludeng, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<h3>Chen Dongbai Takes Office at the Welfare Department Office</h3>
<p>Zhou Yuying, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Social Welfare Department, concurrently served as Deputy Director of the Social Welfare Department of the Eighth District Public Office. Due to the busy political affairs, he submitted a request to the Social Welfare Department to resign from the concurrent position of Director. The department appointed Chen Dongbai, Deputy Director of the office, to be promoted. Chen officially took office at the office at 9 a.m. yesterday.</p>
<h3>Methods for Collecting and Penalizing Delinquent Income Tax</h3>
<p>Since the return of the two concessions, the Shanghai District Collection Bureau of Income Tax of the Ministry of Finance has been actively promoting various taxes. From January to mid-July of this year, it collected more than 20 million yuan, which is several times more than in the past, and can continue to increase in the future. The bureau found that some businesses in the first category of management profit and business income tax have not yet filed and paid. It has selected staff to conduct door-to-door inspections and collections by street and industry. If the businesses delay in filing, make false and concealed reports, or refuse to check accounts, they will violate the provisions of the Provisional Regulations on Income Tax. The bureau has decided to determine the amount of tax payable and report it to the judicial authorities to enforce the enforcement rules for collecting and penalizing income tax. Once the tax amount is determined, it should be paid within the time limit. If the tax is owed and not paid, a fine of more than one time the amount of tax owed will be imposed. At the same time, the bureau has now agreed with the courts in the city to implement the method of penalizing and collecting. Now that the two concessions have been recovered, it is also planning to collect income tax from foreign merchants. It is expected that this tax revenue will definitely be considerable in the future.</p>

<h3>A Visit to the New Society of Wandering Daughters: Mother of God Convent, Part One</h3>
<p>Orphanage · Elementary School · Education and Upbringing Combined</p>
<p>Clinic · Celebration Hall · Helping the Poor and Educating the Community</p>
<p>At the intersection of Yangshupu Road and Ningwu Road, surrounded by factories of all sizes, stand quietly two Western-style buildings with red roofs, making them appear so bright and magnificent against the blue sky dotted with white clouds! This is the new society for wandering daughters that we are introducing to our readers today – the Mother of God Convent.</p>
<p>Mother of God Society – An Extraordinary History</p>
<p>Mother of God Society's China District First Chairwoman, Mother of God is a female religious figure full of love for people and with a calm mind and talent for handling affairs. Talking about the history of the Mother of God Society is fascinating.</p>
<p>In the nineteenth century, after the Industrial Revolution in European countries, the monster of capitalism began to run rampant in the world, driving hundreds of thousands of civilians to factories, leaving their children uncared for in poor streets and alleys. These wandering children lost the opportunity to receive education and upbringing from an early age. When the children's parents had their sweat squeezed out of them and returned with tired skin and resentment, what family fun could they give to their children? In this society and environment, children died, wandered, and even committed wrongdoing, becoming a source of disaster for the country and society. This situation slowly spread throughout Europe, to Asia, and many other places. The defect of this human world could not be filled, and the cries of wandering children were everywhere!</p>
<p>At that time, there was a great Italian saint of the previous century, Father John Bosco, who struggled out of poverty and displacement. He came from the wandering masses and deeply understood the suffering of wandering children. He also understood that wandering children possess unlimited talent, causing unlimited losses to society. He was unwilling to have limited strength, so he "saved poverty with poverty," striving to help wandering children, giving them the necessary education, freeing them from the sea of wandering, and seeing the great road to human rebirth. From then on, the nurturing Father Bosco Young People's Association soon spread to countries all over the world.</p>
<p>Among the wandering children, girls suffered the most. There were also many orphaned female factory workers whose power to survive was even weaker, so the situation was even more tragic. Therefore, Saint John Bosco established a convent, led by the female religious figure Maria Mazzarello, dedicated to the education and upbringing of wandering daughters. This happened in 1872. That female religious education cause has changed countless poor girls and women who used to wander without support into good and promising members of society. The disabled were taken care of, and the sick were treated. It attracted the attention of people in society, gained publicity, and generous assistance from philanthropists. Mother Maria Mazzarello and the members worked even more diligently, and the cause developed. At first, it was only in Turin, Italy, but soon it spread to various countries in Europe, America, Asia, and Africa. Almost everywhere there was a Salesian Association of Don Bosco, there would also be a Mother of God Society. Recently, the number of members has increased to more than 12,000, and there are more than 800 convents.</p>
<h3>Temporary Increase in Tuition Fees; Subsidies Cannot be Changed</h3>
<p>Impoverished Students Eager to Study; Hoping Schools Will Provide Convenience</p>
<p>As the fifth round of the newspaper's student aid fund is about to end, a few students have sent letters, complaining that schools have suddenly announced a temporary increase in tuition fees, which is difficult for impoverished parents to afford. The staff of the newspaper's student aid fund office sends their sincere sympathy, but the procedures for requesting an increase in funding are complicated, and they cannot favor one over another. The subsidy funds have a fixed amount, so they cannot approve the increase for each student, for which they are deeply sorry. They hope that the schools that have temporarily increased tuition fees can understand the eagerness of impoverished students to study and provide them with convenience, which would be a great benefit to impoverished students and a contribution to society.</p>
<p>Preferential Treatment for Books</p>
<p>To reduce the burden on impoverished students, major bookstores in the city, such as Commercial Press, China Bookstore, World Bookstore, Datong Bookstore, and Kaiming Bookstore, will jointly donate coupons for a 10% discount on books purchased by students approved by both this newspaper and the Xin Shen Daily. They are currently being printed and will be distributed as soon as they are ready.</p>
<p>Donations Received Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday, the newspaper received 2,000 yuan from Teacher Wu as a student aid fund, as well as donations from various circles. We thank them all. The list of student aid funds received yesterday is as follows: Teacher Wu, 2,000 yuan; All workers of the Chuxia Road Valais Company (savings from the Taiping Gongjiao), 500 yuan; Sun Jiahang (returned subsidy), 150 yuan; Yao Zhong, Ji Shishen (bonus given as double wages), 114 yuan; Huamei Knitting Factory, 100 yuan; Qin Tingying, Pu Qiting (wishing that the house of good deeds will surely have surplus), 10 yuan each. The total received was 2,904 yuan in deposit certificates. The remaining balance is 1,969,764 yuan.</p>
<p>Application to Change Schools; Supplementary Approval of Subsidies</p>
<p>The following students have canceled their subsidies: Wang Zhongde (Junior High 2), Ni Jiarong (Junior High 3), and Xu Xinghua. The following students have applied to change schools: Wu Dongzhu (Junior High 3) has changed to Renwu Tutoring School. The subsidy remains the same. Li Cuiying (Business Group) has changed to East China University, subsidy 700.500 yuan. Huang Shouwu (University Group), Datong University, 800 yuan. Fang Ruoxu, Cheng Zheng Literary Society, 500 yuan. Jin Shiqing, Nantong College, 700 yuan. Zhang Jifan (Industrial and Commercial Group), Mingxin Accounting School, 300 yuan.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Practicing Decisive Battle Living</h3>
<p>In order to thoroughly implement decisive battle living, the Japanese Consul-General has resolutely implemented restrictions on the sale of alcohol. At the same time, the municipal government's proclamation also stipulates that, starting yesterday, restrictions on the operating hours of bars and dance halls will be enforced, and all gambling dens in Zhabei will be closed. This shows that under the slogan of shared suffering, our ally and our country can no longer tolerate the bad habits of "eating, drinking, and frolicking" and "extravagance" that existed before the resumption of jurisdiction over the foreign concessions, which have caused the entire country to no longer know what decisive battle living means.</p>
<p>The key to decisive battle living is that the entire country can endure hardship, and the conditions for its implementation are that there should be no time, no matter, and no object that does not emphasize economy. Therefore, wartime living must include the extension of working hours, the promotion of production, and the conservation of materials. Restaurants, dance halls, opium dens, and gambling dens are in absolute opposition to decisive battle living. Besides wasting time, abandoning careers, and consuming materials, all kinds of criminal, speculative, adventurous, and shameless behaviors in society can be traced back to these kinds of places. They are factors that poison wartime living and cannot be tolerated by a wartime nation. Therefore, we sincerely hope that the authorities will be determined to expand the anti-poison campaign. What does it mean to expand? For example, when it comes to gambling dens, everyone will ask: Are the most magnificent, most public, and most widely attractive gambling dens only in the South City and Zhabei? If not, then no matter how magnificent their current organization is, they should all be closed to show thoroughness and impartiality.</p>
<h3>Trade Associations Launch Investigation Work; Reviewing Whether Past Price Limits Meet Standards</h3>
<p>In order to stabilize prices and prevent members from illegally raising prices and making profits, trade associations in the city have established price evaluation committees to be responsible for evaluating standard prices and notifying all members to comply. According to the Shanghai News reporter's investigation: All trade associations intend to eliminate the practice of selling goods at high prices. On one hand, they will hold meetings to review whether the previous price limits meet the standards. They have successively notified all members to submit their sales information to the association from now on.</p>
<p>The items to be filled in include: the name of the trade association and the business name, address, nature of business, purchase price, retail sales status, inventory, and the signature and seal of the manager. All businesses must submit each item after receiving this notice and must not deliberately delay. The purpose of the trade associations taking this measure is to transform retail prices into standardization and reduce the burden on the common people. It is also learned that the stores currently have no intention of hoarding goods, because the authorities' investigation work is becoming more strict, and they are afraid of being punished. As a result, the distribution of goods seems to be becoming more stagnant.</p>
<h3>Materials Investigation Committee Investigates Knitwear</h3>
<p>Since the Materials Investigation Committee began investigating hoarded materials, it has now completed the investigation of cotton yarn and cotton cloth hoarded in 581 public and private warehouses throughout the city, and the results of the investigation are currently being reviewed based on the quantity of yarn and cloth registered with the Municipal Economic Bureau and the Trade Control Order. In view of the recent continuous rise in the market prices of foodstuffs, the committee convened its third meeting and decided to expand the scope of the investigation, increasing the number of investigators from 60 to 100, to investigate the reasons for the high market prices of meat and eggs in the city. It is learned that after completing the investigation of yarn and cloth and meat, the committee, in addition to continuing to investigate eggs and cooking oil, has also sent personnel to investigate the hoarding of knitwear from yesterday onwards. All knitwear factories and businesses in the city will be investigated.</p>
<h3>Company Supplementary Registration Deadline Extended by Three Months</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Industry announced the Interim Measures for Company Supplementary Registration and Correction Registration on June 1, 1942, which expired at the end of August this year. After receiving requests from local trade associations to extend the deadline again, the ministry, after reviewing the situation, approved a further extension of three months, from September 1 to November 30.</p>
<h3>Grain Department Bans Illegal Friendship Association</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Food believes that the "Shanghai Special City Oil, Salt, Sauce, and Wine Industry Friendship Association" discovered in the city does not comply with current laws and regulations and has requested the municipal government to strictly ban it and order the Municipal Food Bureau to promptly announce that all companies and firms in the former concession area must join legally organized trade associations as members.</p>
<h3>Stock Market Trends</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Hua stocks were still declining in a roundabout way. The tight money situation at the end of August has passed, but the various sectors of the market are still small due to the lack of confidence. In the department store sector, Wing On fell from a high point. Sincere and National Goods and China Company also showed small declines. China Underwear declined sharply due to selling pressure. There was some buying at low prices for King Fook shirts and socks, but King Lun's transactions were rare and also weak. In the textile sector, Wing On Textile fluctuated narrowly, and Dasheng Mills 3 and 2 also declined. Qingfeng, Meiya, Renfeng, Xinyi, Wuhe, Hongshen, and Greater China Weaving all generally declined. Transactions in the dye industry were also rare. Xinya, Sino-French, Wuzhou, Sino-Western, Sino-British, and Xinyi still showed little improvement. Star Perfume declined sharply, and Rising Star and Scientific Chemical were also weak. In the cultural industry, Commercial Press, China Bookstore, and World Bookstore all declined. Wing Cheung Printing was still flat, Qingong Paper and Zhabei Electric &amp; Water were slightly down, China Electric declined more significantly, Public Electric was stable, Kangyuan Cans was slightly weak, and China Xing Coal, Hanyeping Coal and Iron saw further small declines. Ning Shao Shipping and Shanghai and Xiang Sheng Shipping were all lacking improvement. Sanyou Industrial and Family Industry were still softening. Food stocks Kaison, Amoy Canning all declined, Standard Essence was exclusively supported by large purchases. Fumin Dairy was slightly weak. In the industrial sector, Jiu'an Industrial and Xin'a Construction were the weakest. In the other sectors, Lianhua, Xinyi, and Wing Hing all traded lower, transactions in the Securities and Fabric Exchange were very small, and the financial sector was also weakening. Shanghai, Zhejiang Xing, Jin Cheng, and Salt all had transactions.</p>
<h3>Materials Control Review Committee Shanghai Office Relocated and Established</h3>
<p>In order to facilitate the review of controlled materials in Shanghai and to establish close contact with the Trade Control Committee, the Materials Control Review Committee established a Shanghai Office, appointing Shen Liangzhao as director and Chen Guangzhong as deputy director. They initially set up a temporary office in the Hua Mao Hotel on the Bund. After active preparations, they determined the second floor of the Hamilton Building on Jiangxi Road as the office address. After the arrangements were completed, it was officially established yesterday (the 1st) and began operations. The internal organization is divided into a secretariat and two sections. A public announcement will be made soon. It is reported that the mission of the office is important. For all future material control issues in Shanghai, the office will contact all parties to exchange opinions and resolve all doubts. In addition, it is understood that various Chinese and Japanese executives under the review committee will participate in the office to assist in promoting the control mission.</p>

<p>Public Opinion Reaches Above</p>
<h3>Special Collection of Citizen Opinions on the Construction of Greater Shanghai, Part Two</h3>
<p>Contributions to the Municipal Authorities</p>
<p>At the beginning of the new Shanghai, everything is waiting to be done. I would like to offer a few points that I have seen intuitively to the municipal authorities, hoping that they will make improvements and innovations so that the municipality can "renew itself daily, day after day, and again renew itself." Then the citizens will be fortunate.</p>
<p>Remove All Iron Gates</p>
<p>The iron gates were originally set up by the old concession authorities to discriminate against the citizens of our city. Now that the concessions have been recovered, they should all be removed. In this way, the appearance will be renewed, and the prosperity of the city will depend on it.</p>
<p>Unification of Administration</p>
<p>The staff employed by the former concession authorities had certain standards for their physique and education, their uniforms were neat, and in general, they all had the appearance of martial men, and their salaries were also quite satisfactory. However, there were also a few regrets, namely, due to the influence of foreigners in the past, they developed a bad habit of "bullying others and despising their compatriots" and lacked rationality and good character, resulting in incidents such as the Zhang case. I hope that our police administration after the recovery of the concessions can pay attention to this point and give the police officers appropriate mental and rational training so that they can become a perfect police administration. At the same time, the police in the old city area must also eliminate the weak and retain the strong, correct their spirits, and the uniforms must be unified in each district, and the salaries must be equal.</p>
<p>Roads and Sanitation</p>
<p>In the past, the concession authorities spared no effort in the paving and repair of roads. Cleaners were busy on the streets all day long, carrying out their cleaning work, so the residents enjoyed the benefits of sanitation. In recent years, due to the war, it has been far inferior to before the war, but looking back at the roads in the old city area, it is not the same. I hope that the current municipal authorities can sweep away the bad habits of the past. Not only must they maintain the status quo so that it does not deteriorate, but they must also strive to make progress and devote all their efforts to construction.</p>
<p>Rectify Taxes</p>
<p>In modern countries, taxes are focused on income tax, business tax, and inheritance tax. Today's other books directly increase the burden of consumption. In the future, if the municipal finances are insufficient, they may coordinate with the Ministry of Finance to levy business tax, income tax, and inheritance tax, which the former concession authorities could not collect, to make up for it. In addition, for those who are illegally rich, a considerable exorbitant wealth tax should be levied, and it is not too much to take it. As for the land appreciation tax, it is even more the clear testament of our late Premier Sun Yat-sen. When is it not appropriate to levy it?</p>
<p>Crack Down on Opium and Gambling Dens</p>
<p>Even a three-year-old child knows the harm of opium and gambling dens. However, in the past, the South City had the reputation of being an entertainment district. The places near the opium and gambling dens were crowded with traffic all day long, and the electric lights were as bright as paintings at night. They should be cracked down on as soon as possible. As for the return ball court and the dog racing track, they are also a kind of gambling and are no less harmful than opium and gambling. In the past, under the protection of the concessions, even if public opinion opposed it, it had no effect. Now that the concessions have been recovered, these harmful traps should be resolutely banned.</p>
<p>Develop the Transportation Network</p>
<p>In the past, the North and South urban areas had streetcars and buses, but the war destroyed them all. The citizens' transportation almost entirely depends on walking, which restricts the revival and prosperity of the urban area. I think the city government should coordinate with the relevant agencies to discuss and restore them at the opportune moment. Or restore a part first, or restore the streetcars first and then the buses, and restore the simpler and easier ones first to facilitate citizen transportation. Moreover, once the transportation between the North and South cities is restored, the crowded phenomenon of the two districts of 18 will also be alleviated.</p>
<p>Distribution of Materials</p>
<p>Daily necessities such as soap, matches, towels, cloth, shoes, salt, oil, sauce, and wine must be distributed fairly and effectively. Although sugar, oil, rice, and flour have long been distributed according to the population, it is still not perfect in strict terms. For example, delays from time to time or temporary reductions, etc., are not consistent. Although the reasons may vary, it cannot be denied that those who are in charge have not been loyal to their duties. The distribution of materials is directly related to the survival of the people, and indirectly to the survival of the country and the government. Therefore, the government should appoint officials who distribute materials more cautiously to ensure that it achieves practical results. It is not just a simple appointment that can fulfill their duties. They should carefully examine whether the official or member is indeed honest, upright, and loyal to their duties before solemnly appointing them.</p>
<p>Strictly Enforce Price Limits</p>
<p>In recent years, prices have been rising in a straight line, one after another, without any end. Illegal merchants only seek their own interests and ignore the difficulties of the people's livelihood. Although the former Public Works Bureau and the Public Concession Bureau had issued earnest warnings and imposed strict prohibitions from time to time, they only restrained themselves for a while, and soon the old habits reappeared. The reason is that they have not been punished severely. On July 30, the city government issued a notice strictly prohibiting exceeding the price limits. In the future, I hope that the authorities will enforce the laws and severely punish those who violate them. In this way, prices can gradually fall, and the serious threat to the lives of the people can be gradually eliminated. I hope that the authorities will take action to address it as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Several Prerequisites for Building a New Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Ni Xiaotong</p>
<p>1. Do Not Err on Personnel</p>
<p>Now that China has achieved its desire to recover the concessions, how should we carefully plan future municipal facilities to achieve the ideal of building a new Shanghai? The municipal institutions after the Incident have already had a history of six years, and it can no longer be considered a short period. However, has the achievement of municipal facilities reached the level expected by the general public? Has it reached the purpose expected by the authorities? I think that in the future, with regard to personnel, we should "choose people for the job" and never "choose jobs for the people." In the past, some redundant institutions only increased the burden on the people. Now that the new Shanghai is under construction, we dare to say that the authorities should weigh the importance, priority, and urgency of "people" and "things."</p>
<p>2. Actively Transform the Mentality of Citizens</p>
<p>For a hundred years, the citizens of Shanghai have been too deeply poisoned by Europeanization. Sensuality, money, and gambling have confused and intoxicated the citizens. This crazy situation should now come to an end. History tells us that each country has its own national character and national essence. The mentality of Shanghai citizens in worshiping European and American material civilization has taken root, and the awareness of the country and the nation has become numb due to fading memories. Therefore, if we want to make Shanghai a model for the whole country in politics, economy, culture, education, and public order, we must start with transforming the mentality of the people. To transform the mentality of the people, I think we must start with reviving our country's inherent national character and national essence. Here, I dare to propose our country's inherent culture as the initial stage of transforming the mentality of citizens.</p>
<p>3. Implement Pro-People Policies</p>
<p>If the government wants to implement a certain policy, as long as it is indeed for the benefit of the people, we dare to believe that the people will stand in a supporting position and make greater contributions to the government in terms of human and material resources. The officials and the people should develop the virtue of being affectionate and sincere. That is to say, the rulers should treat the people as their own children, and the people should respect the rulers as their fathers and brothers. Only in this way can the implementation of policies be smooth.</p>
<h3>Thoroughly Transform It</h3>
<p>— Ding Ding</p>
<p>Having lived in Shanghai for twenty years, I am delighted to see the recovery of the concessions and the wiping away of a century of shame. I would like to offer some humble opinions on municipal construction:</p>
<p>Improve the Police Administration</p>
<p>Under the evil influence of the British and Americans, the police administration in the concessions was too dark. I hope that the police administration will be thoroughly reformed today when the concessions are recovered.</p>
<p>Close Gambling Dens</p>
<p>All improper businesses must be ordered to be closed, not to mention gambling dens. The authorities must know about them. I heard that they will be cleared up "in the near future." How slow and circuitous!</p>
<p>Improve Treatment</p>
<p>The treatment of civil servants is too poor. When it is difficult to support a family, they will inevitably commit corruption. However, the cost of living is soaring, and how many people can work without eating? Improving the treatment is imperative.</p>
<p>Build Up the South City</p>
<p>In general, the situation in the South City and Zhabei is inferior to that in the concessions. After the recovery of the concessions, I hope that the municipal administration in the two districts of 18 will be more refined and advanced, and the South City, Zhabei, West Shanghai, and Pudong will be actively built up and the city appearance will be renovated.</p>
<h3>Establishing a Large Library to Supply Spiritual Food</h3>
<p>— Shen Fengwei</p>
<p>Both spiritual and material food are equally needed by the citizens of Shanghai. The universal supply of spiritual food, besides revitalizing the publishing industry, is particularly well served by libraries. As publications are prohibitively expensive, libraries become even more essential. However, it is doubtful whether the existing libraries in Shanghai are sufficient to shoulder the mission of widely distributing spiritual food. As far as I know, the only public and independent library in Shanghai today is the former Shanghai Municipal Council Library on Fuzhou Road. All other libraries are either privately owned or affiliated with organizations and groups. The collection of the former Shanghai Municipal Council Library consists mainly of English books, with very few Chinese books. It is also insufficient for general reference. Among the English books, there are too many popular novels, and the academic reference books are also inadequate. Furthermore, admission to the library requires payment and a guarantor, making the procedure cumbersome and not an ideal place for reading. Other privately owned or organization-affiliated libraries, such as the Modern Scientific Library on Sichuan Road, have mostly Japanese books. The New Asia Library in Cishu Building has a too-low standard. The borrowing procedures are also imperfect. Although the collections of Hongying, Aurora, and the Customs libraries are relatively rich, the admission procedures are cumbersome, or fees are required, making them unable to meet the needs of the general public. Therefore, it seems very necessary to establish a larger-scale municipal library.</p>
<p>It is only natural for a large city to need a large-scale library; however, this is especially urgent for Shanghai today. Because ordinary citizens are unable to afford books under the high pressure of life, a library is necessary to relieve this hunger for spiritual food.</p>
<h3>Prohibiting the Solicitation of Key Money for Rented Housing</h3>
<p>— Wu Chengliang</p>
<p>Solving the Housing Problem in New Shanghai</p>
<p>Housing is an indispensable and major problem in life. Before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the prosperous Shanghai port, with its densely populated areas, experienced a situation where the demand for housing exceeded the supply. General sub-landlords, seeing the need for housing in the market, disregarded the public interest and only sought personal gain. They immediately and privately raised rents, adding on again and again, making it difficult for tenants to bear the burden.</p>
<p>In order to prevent rents from increasing continuously, the authorities previously established a registration system for sub-landlords (which is still continuing), stipulating that the total profit income of sub-landlords shall not exceed two and a half percent, otherwise they would be punished. This was a heavy blow to the general black-hearted sub-landlords, and its effect was immediately visible at the time.</p>
<p>However, recently, seeing that there was no profit to be made, general sub-landlords have changed their approach and started by collecting so-called "key money." When a tenant initially moves into a house, in addition to the monthly rent, they must also pay a certain amount of key money. Considering that in the past, landlords and tenants never had this kind of "key money" in addition to the monthly rent, the amount of "key money" is determined by the bustling location and the size of the house. This is indeed an undeniable fact for the citizens of Shanghai today.</p>
<p>Recently, even more black-hearted sub-landlords have used the excuse of taking back the house for their own use as a threat, forcing the original tenants to move out within a limited time and then re-renting the original house to others, so that they can obtain a large sum of key money.</p>
<p>Now is the time when the concessions have been taken over, and Greater Shanghai has been unified. The authorities are currently engaged in construction and improvement matters. It is urgently necessary to strictly prohibit the solicitation of key money between sub-landlords and tenants.</p>
<h3>Valuable Suggestions (II)</h3>
<p>Xu Youjun: Elaborating on the Hopes for the New Shanghai Construction Plan</p>
<p>Only when clothing and food are sufficient can people know propriety and righteousness. First, the issue of clothing, hoping for rationing; second, the issue of food, hoping for an increase; third, the issue of housing, hoping for "affordable housing"; fourth, the issue of transportation, connected transportation.</p>
<p>Su Dajun: A Preliminary Discussion on the Creation of a Central Park in Shanghai</p>
<p>The main content is to convert the racecourse into a central park, dividing it into three areas, with two-fourths used as a park, with attached sports fields, public education halls, lecture halls, clubs, etc.</p>
<p>Zhang Yichong: Hopes for Shanghai's Administration</p>
<p>1. Eradicate opium and gambling; 2. Eliminate beggars; 3. Demolish dangerous buildings; 4. Build affordable housing; 5. Establish vocational training institutes.</p>
