<h3 id="c1">社評　戰時經濟與社會道德 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>實施戰時經濟的需要，早為各方面所共認，而戰時經濟政策綱領公布以來，也半年多了。然而，實際成就如何？各地影響如何？人民觀感如何？老實說一句，都不能令人滿意！國策沒有貫澈，綱領未盡實踐，外對戰事的協力，內對國民生活的安定也都離題遠甚。我們耳所聞，目所見，身所受，心所感，四顧茫茫，推念前途，有無限的警戒，不能不為國人一痛陳之。</p>
<p>所謂戰時經濟，其要旨就我國在大東亞戰爭中的地位與義務說，在於增强戰力以協助友邦。這裏包含兩大項目，即對內安定民生，增巡生產，對外集結國力，協助戰爭。為了實現這二者，我們必須毫無保留地實施戰時經濟政策綱領，以求國策之貫澈。因此，國家對於經濟部門之統制，勢必日趨加强，這是毫無疑問，也不容瞻顧的。然而，從今日的實際成績，推想以往的事實，其間也不無經騐敎訓，値得我們注意，値得我們研究。</p>
<p>我國國家組識，向不健全，全國國民，習於散漫，這是無庸諱言的。嚴格的紀律，絕對的法治，在國民心目中，一向視為紙面文章，認為實行時必定另有一套，因此，對於戰時經濟政策之實施，就有人認為統制經濟，根木不適合中國國情，雖欲實行，勢必流弊百出，擾民有餘，於國無利。當然，這是過激之論，但檢討過去實施統制經濟的事實，也確有令人變處者。我們不能不加反省。同時，另有一種人，認為今日戰時經濟政策之未能盡如理想，實為未能實行澈底的統制之故，因此，主張對於一切經濟部門，完全實施統制，使國民的日常經濟生活，衣食住行，莫不置於統制之下，則國家政策，就不忠不行。這種卞張，自然也不是毫無根據的，日木德國便是榜樣，値得我們研究。</p>
<p>從理論上研究，一個國家要實行戰時經濟，集中全國經濟的支配權於中央政府，從而以最少的咨材，勞力與資金，使發揮最大的營運能率，為國家爭取戰爭的勝利，這是必然的，絕對的，決沒有在戰時實行自由主義經濟政策，而能獲得任何成果的。我們看常代列强，無論寫為本，為德國，乃至蘇職，自戰爭以來，莫不實施統制經濟，而且就制的範圍，莫不日益擴大，統制的辦法，莫不日益週密而嚴格。因此，我們如果要健全戰時經濟，則統制政策，必不能放鬆。任何部鬥與仟何個人，都不能妄圖茍免與徼倖。</p>
<p>我們認為一方面必須加强統制，改善機構，人事與辦法，但注意於機構健全以外，同時還須求諸政治之改善與社會道德之發揚。使國民正確了解戰時經濟之意義，了解本身對國家對戰爭的責任，協力推行國策，遵守法令，以最大力量貢獻政府，俾共謀國策之實現。同時，國民政府中央各部，如全身神經之中樞，地位重要，對於國家政策之推行，彼此之開，必須取得密切聯繫，各就主管部份謀配合共進之道，收分工合作之效。而各地方政府為指導人民推行國策之基幹，自應與中樞各部及同等機關保持聯絡，秉承巾央方針，遵從中央指承，為同一國策而切實執行應盡之職責。縱橫彼此之間，絕對避免隔閡生疏，各自為政，致形成支離或對立之局面。昨天大陸新報所載，前日木經濟使節團團長小倉正恒氏告我國財界人士一文，（譯文見今日木報第二版）依據他親自來華診斷我國經濟病况之所得，舉出中國處理此時經濟的幾個辦法，他特別强調：　政治與經濟的密切關係，如不打成一片，則不能成為有力國家；　滅私奉公，先國後家的道德之實踐，如人人但知追求一己一家之利而不顧國家與公衆利益，則戰時經濟政策必難實現；　必須首先努力安定民生，政府能保障一般國民最低生活，不只保障極少數人的利益，則戰時經濟政策即易收效。小倉氏這種金玉之言，實為輔助統制政策而使我國戰時經濟起死回生的對症良藥。道三點的實現，沒有第二法的，就只求政治道德與社會道德的發揚。</p>
<p>誠然，在今日言政治道德與社會道德，或許太迂遠了！可是，要挽救目前我國經濟危機，確實要靠這一點。我們竭　期望當局及社會領袖，以身作則，表現共大公無私的政治與社會的道德，同時在消極方面，大義滅親，對於違反戰時經濟政策的，認眞懲辦，務使中外視聽為之一新。政府的威信提高了，通貨的信用提高了，國積投機之風氣降抑了，民衆生活有了保隙，大家共認政府之可敬可愛，生產事業自然會發展，戰時經濟就自然會上軌道，內外國策之實現，也可指日以待了！眞知與力行，我們迫切期待着常道與社會領袖！</p>

<p>— 小倉正恆</p>
<p>中國國民政府前曾毅然參加大東亞戰爭，聲明與日本同生共死的決意。茲又收回租界，脫却了百年來半殖民地的地位，名副其實地恢復了獨立國的榮譽，洵堪慶幸。這一世紀在中國實是荊棘滿路，顚沛備嘗，而今則宿願得償，中國復興，指日可期，踏上了大東亞解放的巨步，中國人士的欣喜，不難想像得之。</p>
<p>但收阿和界祇是一種政治的措置。至於在現實上有何效果，則是將來的問題。例如治安，如其因收回了租界而萬一惡化起來，則一片苦心，盡成畫餅，而亦將有碍於中國的臉顏吧，總之，今後的一切施策，應由中國人自已負起責任來實行，是功是罪，唯有求之於已，中國人的責任，實甚重大，而對於實際上占上海的中樞的財界人士　亦期　　　。爰趁此機會，聊述管見以供中國財界人士的參考。</p>
<p>脫却外國羈絆</p>
<p>首先我想說的，是上海在法律上脫却了外國羈絆，而同時在精神上，也淸　歐美思望，　中國人並東洋人的才來　　　更就今日前時勢而論，希望充分貫澈與日本協力以完速大東亞戰爭的理念。上海向來是內地物資的集散地，同時，依存於國外貿易者亦極大，因此，無可避免地蒙受了歐美的影響。大東亞戰爭勃發後，國外貿易全告斷絕的結果，在不跟着經濟走而取獨立形態的精神上，難道還沒有拭去英美的殘　嗎？</p>
<p>物質不虞匱乏</p>
<p>例如：說到上海，就要聯想到頹廢文化。近來中國有很多人說：「日本終　只說精神，美國則給與了我們大量的物貿」。於是從這觀點，對於日本在大東亞戰爭中的實力，抱着危懼之念，這是寡聞，這僅是表面的事實。</p>
<p>然而第一，因為中國人不會忘却英美在大量輸入物資　同時又輪入了雅片。中國人已經深切地經騐着，所有的英美人，他們不會送掉一梯東四而不取任何代價的。第二，現在是空前大戰的最酣期，即在日本，沒有豐寫的物貿，乃是當然的事，此不僅日本為然，在英美亦有此種共同現象，毫無異致。何况日本已占領豐富的南方資源，而積極開發中，所以對日本前途抱危懼之念者·完全是杞人之憂然而現在提出這理由者，實因中國雖擁有地大物博的國土，然物資尚有類別地的供給，因而其精神本身，也就成為問題了。中國喜歡這豐富的物資呢？還是同時更喜歡永久的獨立？錯過了今日的機會，中國將無復興的希望吧！大東亞戰爭的結果，就是中國的將來，中國即使為了自身，今日也應該講求一切方法，忍受困苦，以戰勝大東亞戰爭。須記得亡六國者非秦也，六國自亡之耳。</p>
<p>下面想以。上述的理念為前提，而說到略為具體的問題。</p>
<p>政治與經濟一體</p>
<p>第一，政治與經濟有密切關係。所有的獨立國，非具有鞏固的政治力與强靱的經濟力不可。而這二者在今日的世界情勢下，終非個別的東西，如不打成一片，則不能成為一個強有力的國家。然而在中國，對此二者之問，從未存在着理想的關係。</p>
<p>處於今日的局勢，每個國家不能有不適應國策的經濟的發展•例如通貨的信用　以對於政府的信類為前提，而通貨如無信用，則經濟不能運營。</p>
<p>第二，指導經濟的理念應如何　經濟應該適應國策，所以其指導理念自然亦應為以大衆的利益為先　滅私奉公　不用說，資本主義時代的經濟理念為追求利潤，但在今日，世外各國亦均以大衆利益為先實踐先國復家之道德，集中國家的經濟力於途行戰爭的一點，現在尚違反國家的要求，而惟耽於利潤的追求，如此而欲與世界各國為伍，雖矣！</p>
<p>現在上海最大的問題而被注目的，如囤積事件，雖然情形複雜，但終究是缺乏公益觀念所引起結果。希望　速淸算這思想，以資安定民生。</p>
<p>安定民生公益為先</p>
<p>第三為安定民生。在一切戰爭經濟上，民衆被迫减低生活，這實是不得已的現象。最低生活而不能維持，則不能遂行戰爭。在這裏存在着民生問題的重要性與困雖。</p>
<p>中國現在的情况，以物價　貴，尤以生活必需品的昻騰最為嚴重，致民生不能安定。　最大原因　基於如　所述的缺乏公益為先的觀念。而在另一面　因生產减退而致物資缺乏，亦有很大的作用所。以外國　入告絕之後的民生間　立即與增强生產的問題有關聯，而增强生產不僅攸關民生　即在完遂戰爭上，亦是切要的問題。在上海立即要實　增强生產，似不輕易可致　但中國供給豐富的資源與勞力，日本供給資本與技術，則未必沒有打開的方法。</p>
<p>中國人富於經濟適應性</p>
<p>以上我大胆的略述愚見，此等事項，其實行自非咄嗟立辦，如無全中國人民傾其心身的全力以赴，終於難期成功，我曾訪問中國，親自與當地財界的有力　士懇談，獲悉諸君具有完遂戰爭的堅決意志，不禁深為感動　原來中國人士富於經濟的適應性，共經濟的手腕，即在全世界亦早有定評，所以一旦堅決其心志，而對其實行，相倌不必對之有所不安。我們的心理，也為了中國的復與，大東飯戰爭的完　，而傾全力以赴，所以對於大東亞共榮圈最有力的一員之中國，切望合後有　進一步的協力　　　　　　　　　　大</p>

<p>前工部局總董岡　勝男氏，曾於昨（四日）晚，對於交還公共租界一事，假座大上海電台，廣播演說、其演詞如下：今日吾儕在上海方慶祝上海公共租界暨法和界交還中國國民政府，此事在此一大國家及其人民百年來，爲國家自由與獨立而奮鬥之歷史上、　爲一轉捩點。同時中國及其人民得能完遂收同上海租界完整的行政權與管轄權之努力，値得非常注意。鄙人以前工部局總董之資格，對於此一盛舉，略抒觀感。</p>
<p>百年以來歷史轉</p>
<p>此一具有歷史性德事件之重要與意義、誠爲浩大，此種意義與重要性、此時容或不能估計、但鄙人深信極易爲全中國所領會，現在鄙人所願特別抒述者，厥爲日本政府與人民、時時願見中國能脫離不平等之東縛，與夫英美之侵略榨取。中國能强盛與獨立，對於中國人民之福利，固屬重要，但關係東亞之共同福利，亦非淺鮮，此爲東亞民族與人民所企望者也。</p>
<p>中山先生理想實現</p>
<p>誠年以前，中國及其人民或嘗感覺遭遇挫折、同時或嘗放棄爭取自由與獨立之策鬥。皮以英權益，僅向中國及其人民給與空頭之諾言，此種諾言，就吾人所知，迄未履行。不宵唯是，彼英美國家，爲發展與維持其私愁起見，曾鼓動中國與日本互相戰爭，以遂其傳統的離間政策。孫中山先生　嘗言中國與日本，爲當然之朋友，決非爲敵人，今日舉行具有歷史性的盛典，吾儕目擊孫中山先生畢生懷抱之理想，卒告實現矣。中國與日本人民雖曾固誤會而發生戰事，但不久以後、中國經日本之友誼協力與兩同盟國之諒解，已重獲國家之獨立與自由，日本與日本人氏，所引爲欣慰者，當無過於中國之能早日實現其願望，此種事實，彰彰明甚。</p>
<p>行政事務尚未成功</p>
<p>自鄙人就任工部局總董以還、歷時廿月，公部局行政效率，已見增進，社會治安，已經完全恢復、同時健全之市政財政政策，亦已實施、此爲鄙人與同僚等差堪告慰者。社會名方面，咸與工部局熱烈合作，使各項計劃，得以順利推行，郎人輿同僚等深爲感佩。在上海最堪注意者，厥爲自大東亞戰本發動以後，整個社會，不論國籍，一致爭取共同目標，此即確保上海之治安與繁榮是也。鄙人所引爲憾事者，即行政事務，工部局未能辦理成功而有待於繼續舉辦者，不在少數，此實因上海市政，劃分三區管理，舉凡征收捐稅，統制物價等等，各自爲政，所幸現在上海行政已告統一，此後各該問題，行見改進也。</p>
<p>各方聯擊共負責任</p>
<p>鄙人現在對於上海之民意方面，略抒所見，大東亞戰事之進行、使此一大城市之市民、成產生自覺之心理，此種自覺之心理，　於本市公務之革新，科助非淺，全中國人民，尤其上海市民爲最、逐漸盛覺中國人當爲其自身命運之支配人。結果本市公務之執行，與華人各界領袖之意見之間，發生一種密切之聯繫，社會各方面之能深明市民之責任，實爲最健全徵兆之一種，上海前途之進步與發展，定可預卜，此層値得鄭重提出。</p>
<p>茲者整個上海之市政管理，業已交還中國政府，甚切中國領袖，關於中国之復興方面，能妥善洽埋。一般中國人民之增强爲公心理，與夫在上海維持一良好市政管理，實爲保證上海將來進步與發展之兩種因素。</p>
<p>希望市民信賴當局</p>
<p>上海一區擁有極多戰之民右與商業機關、如俱樂部，商業同業公會，教會組織等等，以及大銀行與商店，　各種機關與團　，余本人相信，在樹立一種健全的市政管理方針之時，名該機關與組織之利益允宜顧及。本市之繁榮，與編製預算，增裕稅教各項之健全辦法，關係非常密切，不容分離，此爲鄙人所深信者。同時本人敢信，自大東亞戰事發動以後，上海工部局已培養水市布民之信仰心，此種信仰心，工部局爲公衆福利計。並已試予把握之。市民之信仰心裨助於余等繁複職務之履行，爲値至鉅，深望一般市民及右盡之士，今後對於在陳市長領導下之新布政機關，能繼續予以充分協助與機　。陳市長經騐宏富。畏才碩望，領導此一大城市之行政，堪稱最爲相宜，鄙人深信陳市長定能獲得中外各級人士之最大的信任與倚賴。最後鄙人暨各同僚對於上海之將來，願寄予最大的信任，中國及其人民現已站立在一新時代的開端，希望能憑自己的創這力與智力，，奮發有爲，完成中國之復興也，</p>

<h3 id="c48">自由的眞義 <a href="#c48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— 一必</p>
<p>有些人說「自由」的意義便是沒右管東－就是一個自由的人能做任何他高興做的事。他不是像一匹馬或一頭牛的被旁人在後面鞭督着向前或向後。如果「自由」的解釋只是如此，能做你所高興的事，那世問便永遠沒有「自由」這件事了。</p>
<p>在一個秩序紊亂的國家中，沒有法律，沒右警察也沒有政府，你能隨意的來或去，能隨意的工作或遊蕩，又能隨意的偷或殺人，但是這些不是你眞正的自由，因爲在這稱「自由」的悄形之下，你也有危險性被人搶刧，阻止，甚至於被殺。在一個野蠻的區城內，那裏沒右規則，法律及其他；在一個荒島上，那裏沒有人反對你，阻止你，但是這樣你的眞正「自由」可謂完全失去，因爲你所做的這一切是無價値的，你「自由」的內容是無用的，更因爲你「自由」的意義是太小了。</p>
<p>另一面看來，在一個政府堅强，法律嚴緊的國家內，一個人發展的機會也最多，也就是說他是一個最自由的人，因爲他能夠利用關家所給與的機會來質獻大事業，這才是有利於大衆的眞自由。</p>

<p>— 甘仲安</p>
<p>論語上說：「子空言利用」孟子也說：「鷄鳴而起　　爲利者　之徒也」。由此，可以知道古時的大聖大賢，都不贊成「利」；因爲利是亂的起源。</p>
<p>近世風俗卑陋，求利者比比皆是。說到利，有正當的和不正當的兩種。譬如農夫盡力耕田，秋收後以其收獲物貢獻社會。以博利而維持生活，那便是正當的利，至於今日上海的囤虎，乘人之危，大囤其物，然後以非法高價出售，剝削小民，其所謂利、眞是不正當到極點了·人們爲利而奔波，爲利而甘受一切苦難，甚而至於爲利而喪失掉生命；由此可知它的引誘力眞是其大無比了。從前軍閥的互爭堆盤、於是引起戰爭；結果是人民遭殃，弄得流離失所，衣食不細；是什麼綠故呢？</p>
<p>我們要止亂，就先要使人民的腦海裏，沒有利的觀念；如何可以辦到呢　當茲叔季之世，這高一尺，魔高一丈，這是制度的不良，有待改革；另一方面那就要僭重教育之功丁。人人受到良好的敎育。那麼知識提高，知道應當做的和不應當做的：又明白善與惡的分別，大家都沒有「利」的觀念，　事自然不曾發生。</p>

<p>— 汪國瑗</p>
<p>鐵道交通就猶之乎是人體內底大動脈，它不但負有運輸養料至身體各部組織的使命，而且和全身各系統都有着密切的關係，這個循環血液的機構發生障碍或是因爲大動脈的不健全而不能充分發揮它底效能時，不但會影饗到人體的健全而且對於人底生命也有嚴重的打擊。過去因為內河航運的不能充分暢行和發展，因而鐵道交　的重要性也愈加增大，在京滬，滬杭兩條的生命綫上，在上海北站的大吞吐口中，每日來往進出的何止百千萬人？所以「華鐵」當局的責任不僅僅是對於交通的方面『便是經濟，甚至民生，治安，秩序方面也有莫大的影響。</p>
<p>對於鐵道交通的亟待改善，申報底社評裏已經大胆地，忠實地說了許多大家心裏所感到的要說而訥訥不曾出口的話，今天我趁着「華鐵」當局澈鹿改組內部機講的機會，再通以萬分的熱誠向「華鐵」當局供獻一些我所感覺到的膚淺的建議。</p>
<p>本來，「華鐵」的改組便是爲了適應飛躍增進之業務，並期能率向上及事務簡捷之澈底化；所以改革後出現的新體制，自能不負社會人士底期望而能收到預期的效果。不過我以爲在改革的過程中也不能太注重犖犖大者而略視小處。最好要能「從大處着眼而從小處着手！「譬如要使營業繁榮，沿途防衛周密，車站內治安和秩序增强……等都是大的日標。如果想要達到這大的目標，就必須要徒下級幹部人材的訓練做起。如呆太注重大的而忽略了小的，那就等於一個根鬚不半的大樹想要枝葉扶疏一　地困難。有些須要改善的小節與許當局還不言澈底地觀察到，所以我提供出一點來請公司當局改善：那就是職工們底工作教能和服務逍德的問題：我不是指摘、也不是非難，的確，一班職工們太忽略了他們底資任和道德。譬如售票時的揩油，對陌生旅客的無禮和　弄，對販戶們的公開轟詐等，常常會造成嚴重的後果。使市民發生怨尤的不懌的反感！我希望常局至少要做到：　增加班次和車輛减少擁濟的現象，免得不良份子從中漁利。　注意訓練員工們底思想和道德；嚴格地執行功賞罪罰的辦法一，使他們都有　事愛人的美德。　取締　　金融的販戶以　助增進統制的效能，同時可以確保眞正旅客們的秩序和安寗。　儘量採納興論界的提洪，抱定「有則改之，無則加勉」的納諫態度。宋了，爲了治安的確保，車站上一班流氓地痞以及白相人之流的惡徒，實在有驅除的必要！這才使旅客們不致抱有視出門爲長途的心理。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Editorial: Wartime Economy and Social Morality <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The need to implement a wartime economy has long been recognized by all parties, and it has been more than half a year since the promulgation of the Outline of Wartime Economic Policies. However, what are the actual achievements? What are the effects in various places? What are the people's perceptions? To be honest, none of them are satisfactory! National policies have not been thoroughly implemented, the outline has not been fully realized, and cooperation with the war externally and the stability of the people's lives internally are far from the topic. What we hear, what we see, what we experience, and what we feel, looking around in confusion, thinking about the future, there is infinite warning, and we cannot but express it to the people of the country with great pain.</p>
<p>The essence of the so-called wartime economy, in terms of our country's position and obligations in the Greater East Asia War, lies in enhancing war power to assist friendly nations. This includes two major items, namely, stabilizing people's livelihoods and increasing production internally, and concentrating national strength and assisting the war externally. In order to achieve these two, we must implement the Outline of Wartime Economic Policies without reservation, in order to thoroughly implement national policies. Therefore, the state's control over the economic sector will inevitably become stronger day by day, which is beyond doubt and should not be hesitated. However, judging from today's actual achievements and thinking about past facts, there are indeed some experiences and lessons that are worthy of our attention and research.</p>
<p>Our country's national organization has always been unsound, and the people of the whole country are accustomed to being scattered, which is undeniable. Strict discipline and absolute rule of law have always been regarded as empty words by the people, who believe that there must be another set of practices when they are implemented. Therefore, regarding the implementation of wartime economic policies, some people believe that controlled economy is fundamentally unsuitable for China's national conditions. Even if it is implemented, it will inevitably lead to numerous malpractices, causing more disturbance to the people than benefiting the country. Of course, this is an extreme view, but reviewing the facts of the past implementation of controlled economy, there are indeed things that are unsettling. We cannot but reflect on this. At the same time, there is another type of person who believes that the reason why today's wartime economic policies have not been as ideal as expected is because of the failure to implement thorough control. Therefore, they advocate that complete control should be implemented over all economic sectors, so that the people's daily economic life, including food, clothing, housing, and transportation, is placed under control. Then the national policy will be carried out without fail. This kind of proposition is naturally not without basis. Japan and Germany are examples, and they are worthy of our research.</p>
<p>From a theoretical point of view, if a country wants to implement a wartime economy, it must concentrate the power to control the national economy in the central government, so as to exert the greatest operational efficiency with the least amount of resources, labor, and capital, and strive for the victory of the war for the country. This is inevitable and absolute. There is absolutely no way to implement a liberal economic policy during wartime and obtain any results. We see that the great powers of the past, whether it was the United States, Germany, or even the Soviet Union, have all implemented controlled economies since the war, and the scope of control has been expanding day by day, and the methods of control have been becoming more and more thorough and strict. Therefore, if we want to improve the wartime economy, the control policy must not be relaxed. No department or individual can attempt to avoid or take chances.</p>
<p>We believe that on the one hand, we must strengthen control and improve institutions, personnel, and methods, but in addition to paying attention to the soundness of institutions, we must also seek improvement in politics and the promotion of social morality. Make the people correctly understand the meaning of wartime economy, understand their own responsibilities to the country and the war, cooperate in promoting national policies, abide by laws and regulations, and contribute to the government with the greatest strength, so as to jointly seek the realization of national policies. At the same time, the central departments of the National Government, like the central nervous system of the whole body, occupy an important position. In order to promote national policies, they must establish close ties with each other and seek ways to cooperate and make progress in their respective responsible departments, so as to achieve the effect of division of labor and cooperation. And the local governments, as the foundation for guiding the people to promote national policies, should maintain contact with the central departments and equivalent institutions, adhere to the central guidelines, follow the central instructions, and earnestly perform their due responsibilities for the same national policy. Between vertical and horizontal, absolutely avoid separation and unfamiliarity, and each act in its own way, resulting in a fragmented or confrontational situation. As reported in the Continental News yesterday, Mr. Ogura Masatsune, the head of the former Japanese economic mission, told the Chinese financial community in an article (translated in today's Japanese newspaper, second edition), based on his personal diagnosis of China's economic ills, put forward several ways for China to deal with the economy at this time. He especially emphasized: The close relationship between politics and economy, if they are not integrated, cannot become a powerful country; The practice of destroying selfishness and serving the public, putting the country before the family, if everyone only knows how to pursue their own personal and family interests and ignores the interests of the country and the public, then the wartime economic policy will be difficult to implement; It is necessary to first strive to stabilize people's livelihoods, and the government can guarantee the basic living standards of the general public, not just the interests of a very small number of people, then the wartime economic policy will be easy to achieve. Mr. Ogura's golden words are indeed a symptomatic medicine for assisting the control policy and reviving China's wartime economy. The realization of these three points has no other method, only seeking the promotion of political morality and social morality.</p>
<p>Indeed, talking about political morality and social morality today may be too circuitous! However, to save China's current economic crisis, we really need to rely on this point. We earnestly hope that the authorities and social leaders will set an example, demonstrate the great public spirit and selfless political and social morality, and at the same time, in a negative way, put righteousness before family loyalty and severely punish those who violate wartime economic policies, so as to give a new look to the Chinese and foreign media. The government's prestige is improved, the credit of currency is improved, the atmosphere of national speculation is suppressed, the people's lives are guaranteed, everyone recognizes that the government is respectable and lovely, the production industry will naturally develop, the wartime economy will naturally be on the right track, and the realization of domestic and foreign policies can also be expected soon! True knowledge and action, we are eagerly awaiting from the authorities and social leaders!</p>

<p>Nanjing, 4th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>The two Shanghai concessions have been recovered by the National Government, and the financial construction of Shanghai in the future and the current general financial problems are of great concern to all parties. The reporter specifically visited Vice Minister Chen Zhishuo of the Ministry of Finance, who answered the questions as follows: What are your observations on the financial construction of Shanghai after the recovery of the Shanghai Public Concession? The two Shanghai concessions have a history of nearly a hundred years, and because they enjoy special privileges and have various special relationships, they are superficially prosperous, mostly in terms of consumption. Now that the concessions have been recovered, they can gradually return to the true economic track. We should seize this excellent opportunity to focus on general wartime production, and at the same time focus on improving necessities, and adopt extreme thrift, limiting consumption. The construction of the industry is the development of production, and the development of production is the construction of finance. The prosperity of tax revenue and the vigor of production are closely related, and are mutually cause and effect. We cannot only focus on the financial income, but forget that other aspects of finance are branches. If the roots are solid, the branches and leaves will naturally flourish, and there is no need to discuss it in depth. What are your thoughts on the Japanese National Exchange Economic Mission? The Japanese Economic Mission came to China to inspect and conduct various on-the-spot investigations and interviews on our country's economy, and both sides have achieved great results in their respective economies. In the future, the two sides will work hard to cooperate, and there will be better phenomena in agriculture, industry, and commerce. Has the government's budget for the second half of the 32nd year been established, and what are the key points? The government's budget for the first half of the 111nd year has been approved by the National Defense Conference and has been formally established. The key point is to adapt to the wartime state, and the focus of the general budget should be on the needs and differences. What is the general financial situation now? The current general financial situation has a great impact on the recovery of the Shanghai concessions, and it also has a considerable relationship with the national economy and the general social economy. This is well known and need not be repeated.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to a Fukuoka telephone report, Mr. Ishiwatari Shotae, the economic advisor to the Chinese National Government, arrived in Fukuoka by plane from Shanghai on the afternoon of the 4th to handle important business in Japan, and boarded a train to the east at 7:06 pm. According to Mr. Ishiwatari's statement in Fukuoka regarding the current situation of the Chinese economic community, the general idea is: After Japan implemented new policies in China, the cooperation of people in the Chinese business community has become more and more active. From this, it can also be seen that they are eager to revive China. Regarding the current problems in the Chinese economic community, a method has been formulated to deal with them, and it will be implemented soon. In addition, the establishment of a stabilization fund for the currency in North China and Central China is currently underway. Chairman Wang of the National Government arrived in Shanghai the other day and met with people from the Shanghai business community and gave many instructions, and the results were quite satisfactory. The Chinese National Government, in order to implement the New National Movement, launched a large-scale savings encouragement campaign on August 1st, so China's economic construction can be said to be gradually entering the right track. The characteristic of the Chinese economic community is that there is a surplus of labor, so use this surplus labor and revitalize industry. In short, China is currently a strong wing in establishing the Greater East Asia Economic Sphere, and is developing steadily forward.</p>
<h3 id="e9">Japanese Army Wins Surprise Attack on New Guinea Front, Captures Solid Position Built by US Army <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - In the South Pacific region, a fierce battle is being waged by the navy, army, and air force for days. On the New Guinea front, since the US army landed in Nassau Bay on June 30th, it has been constantly attacking with the aim of capturing a Japanese base. A part of the enemy's strong force, possessing a large number of tanks, had advanced to a place south of Shoramoa, where they built a solid five-stage position, attempting to continue their attack. Therefore, in order to crush the enemy's advanced base in one fell swoop, the Japanese army began operations at dawn on the 29th of last month, crossed the rear end of the enemy's position, broke through the woodland area, and carried out a large detour operation. By about 5:00 pm on the 29th, they had advanced to the rear of the left wing of the enemy's position and began to carry out a surprise attack from the rear of the enemy. The enemy was caught off guard and fell into a state of confusion. Later, seeing that the Japanese army was very small, they dispatched war markets to resist tenaciously, and a melee broke out in the enemy's position. The Japanese army waved their bayonets and charged, with the leader and major Hisahisa leading the way, penetrating deep into the enemy's position, waving his knife to kill the enemy, and throwing grenades to repel the enemy. They repeatedly took the enemy's position. At 10:00 pm, they seized the army's ammunition, and continued to fight bravely. After a while, Lieutenant Tanaka also stepped forward and jumped in, fighting with the enemy soldiers everywhere for about half an hour, finally capturing the five-stage solid position built by the enemy. The enemy abandoned many corpses and fled in embarrassment. At the same time, 12 enemy tanks, 5 automatic rifles, 13 automatic pistols, 50 grenades, 1,500 rounds of ammunition, and many other weapons were captured. The Japanese side lost three soldiers and 14 were injured.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from a certain Japanese military location, the US military has launched several attacks on a certain Japanese forward location in the Solomon Islands since July 17th, but they were all met with fierce attacks from Japanese fighter squadrons or anti-aircraft fire, suffering great damage and retreating. However, disregarding all damages, the enemy attacked again on the evening of the 1st with 20 Type 100 (B24) heavy bombers, fighter jets, and 90 carrier-based bombers, totaling 100 aircraft. The Japanese war gates immediately took off to meet the enemy, shooting down four enemy aircraft and repelling them, forcing them to flee south. The Japanese side suffered very little damage.</p>

<h3 id="e13">US Economic Pressure Forces Argentina to Submit <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - US President Roosevelt dreamed of controlling the world, and this time he suddenly adopted economic pressure against Argentina, the only neutral country in the Americas. It remains to be seen whether Argentina, which has been subjected to such strong economic pressure, can continue to maintain neutrality. The Domei News Agency reporter specifically visited Naval Attaché Bortolo, a major general from the Argentine Embassy in Japan, to inquire about his views. He said: "The Argentine Embassy in Japan has not yet received a telegram from its home country, so it cannot express an official opinion. However, judging from the past, the United States has often adopted a strong pressure policy towards Argentina, so this incident was also expected. The United States has repeatedly tried to get Argentina to participate in the war against the Axis powers, but the Argentine government, based on its own independent position, resolutely rejected it, so the United States has taken this further pressure. The people of Argentina are independent people, and once a major policy of the country is decided, it will not allow other countries to interfere. Since Argentina has its own policy, it will continue to strictly adhere to neutrality. In terms of trade between the United States and Argentina, Argentina has always imported industrial products such as working machinery from the United States, and Argentina's main exports are food. After the United States implements an economic embargo against Argentina this time, what kind of impact will it have directly? It is necessary to see the future situation before it can be clarified, so it cannot be asserted at present. In my personal opinion, Argentina's policy will not change because of this. Although Argentina is under pressure from the United States, it will still act according to its own will and will not be moved by the United States."</p>
<h3 id="e14">The Righteous Government Expresses its Position: Determined Not to Be Forced into Ceasefire, Vowing to Cooperate Loyally with Allies to the End <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Rome, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The anti-Axis powers, taking advantage of the Italian political upheaval, presented Italy with seven articles, coercing Italy into a ceasefire. The Italian government authorities, on the 3rd, expressed their position on this matter, stating: The seven conditions proposed by the anti-Axis forces are nothing more than a demand for Italy's unconditional surrender. However, Prime Minister Badoglio, upon taking office, had already expressed his determination to continue the war. Therefore, the Italian government vows to cooperate loyally with its allies to the end, fully and completely. Among the articles proposed by the anti-Axis forces, the withdrawal of German troops was listed as one of the conditions. However, German troops are currently fighting alongside Italian troops in Sicily, which is the Italian government's concrete response to the anti-Axis demands.</p>
<p>Rome, 3rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to Mr. Ho Han Burke, a special correspondent for Huitong News Agency, the relationship between Germany and Italy is currently in a very friendly state, with even closer cooperation among military leaders. The reception for the German and Japanese press conference continues to be held. The friendly atmosphere can be seen in the fact that Italian announcements still refer to the "Axis forces." Newspapers are now focusing on assisting German troops in resisting in Sicily. They are actively praising the German air force's contributions in western Sicily. The Italian public sincerely rejects the anti-Axis peace proposals. The daily newspaper on Tuesday carried a commentary on recent changes and overtures, with political circles believing that the publication of the conditions allows the Italian public to understand the enemy's surrender demands. The public remains calm, believing that the Badoglio government will decide on the most beneficial policies for Italy. In northern Italy, normalcy has been restored, and no new demonstrations have occurred.</p>
<p>Milan, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a report from the German News Agency, the Italian newspaper "Stampa" published an article entitled "Italy Under the Military Strategy System." The article stated that Italy's internal affairs must be coordinated with the military situation. The newspaper asserted that Europe at war is undergoing the organization of a military strategy system. From a military perspective, Europe today represents a unified organic whole. No country in Europe can act independently in this system. Italian troops are not only fighting in Sicily, but also strong detachments are stationed alongside German troops in the Balkans, the Dodecanese Islands, and French-occupied territories. The military and political system of European warring nations unites all countries. No country can pursue its selfish interests independently outside this system.</p>

<p>Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to reports from the Eastern Front, by August 2nd, German forces had captured 17,895 Soviet troops in the Mius region. The number of Soviet troops killed and wounded was several times higher than this. In addition, 730 heavy cannons, 398 mortars, and a large amount of other military equipment were captured. Enemy troops whose war equipment was destroyed or captured had broken into the German positions north of Kuibyshevo but were surrounded and sealed off by German tank units and infantry. After several failed attempts to break through, Soviet forces are now concentrating their attacks on the Donets and Belgorod regions. Yesterday, they launched a large-scale offensive with strong infantry and armored units, which was completely repelled. In the Belgorod region, fierce fighting is ongoing. Yesterday, Soviet forces launched a major offensive in the southwestern Orel region, where a major battle is underway. However, these localized battles on the Southern Front have been repelled by German forces, inflicting significant damage and losses. The German air force has been assisting the army effectively. Soviet forces launched another large-scale attack with infantry and tank units south of the Ladoga River, but all attempts were unsuccessful.</p>

<p>Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to Mr. Braeunaege, a special correspondent for the German News Agency, German and Italian troops achieved a significant defensive victory yesterday in the central sector of the Italian front. Although the British attack was strongly supported by the air force, the attacking forces suffered partial losses during the defenders' counterattack and a significant amount of equipment was captured. German military officials stated that after this victory, the Anglo-American forces would need at least three divisions to be replenished from new reserves.</p>
<p>Rome, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Italian military headquarters' official report today stated that the anti-Axis forces repeatedly attempted to break through the central sector of the Sicilian front between Regalbuto and Sant'Agata, but were repelled by the stubborn resistance of the Axis forces. Fierce fighting has been ongoing in that area for four days, and the battle situation is currently intense. The Axis air force is assisting ground operations and frequently bombing targets on land and at sea. German fighter planes shot down three enemy "Liberator" aircraft in the eastern Ionian Sea. Italian minesweepers also shot down two enemy twin-engine aircraft in the same area.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to London news, British Prime Minister Churchill announced on Thursday that the anti-Axis forces had begun a new offensive in Sicily. He stated, "Our overall attack in Sicily began on the afternoon of the 1st. There was widespread fighting throughout yesterday. The anti-Axis command has used the lull in fighting last week to send reinforcements to the front lines."</p>

<p>Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to the Huitong News Agency, "German Military News" reported that after the British and American forces landed on Sicily, those concerned with military affairs were paying particular attention to Crete in the eastern Mediterranean. Some people believe that Crete, which has been occupied by German forces for two years, may be attacked by the anti-Axis forces. The German occupation of the island holds a strategically important position. In the past two years, the island's defensive facilities must have been greatly strengthened. While German officials have neither confirmed nor denied this report, German reports mentioned the fortifications on Crete. The German troops who seized the island two years ago participated in designing the island's defense enhancements. Based on their experiences, they must have made appropriate contributions. There has been thorough research on how to respond to all offensive strategies. In order to counter enemy paratroopers infiltrating the interior to carry out harassment, not only are the coastal areas fortified, but there are also various preparations in the central part of the island. The island's terrain is steep and rugged, making it very unfavorable for paratrooper landings. The few plains that exist have been equipped with barbed wire and other obstacles. The island's key passes have been heavily fortified.</p>

<p>Ankara, 3rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – It has been learned that the Turkish authorities have drafted a reply to the anti-Axis note of last week, which demanded that neutral countries not harbor Axis leaders. This was acknowledged by Reuters correspondent Walter Fiedler here. The reply is said to be strongly worded and rejects the anti-Axis proposal. Turkish officials have expressed strong resentment that the anti-Axis note violates international law regarding asylum regulations and infringes upon Turkish sovereignty. The Turkish Foreign Minister departed Ankara for Istanbul this evening. It is believed that the purpose of his trip is to personally deliver the reply to the Turkish President for approval.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to Ankara news, the Turkish Foreign Minister, in conversations with foreign diplomats over the past few days, declared that Turkey's policy of strict neutrality would not be affected by the recent developments in Italy.</p>
<h3 id="e19">To Those in Chinese Financial Circles <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>– Ogura Masatsune</p>
<p>The National Government of China once resolutely joined the Greater East Asia War, declaring its determination to live and die with Japan. Now, it has recovered its concessions, shedding its century-long semi-colonial status and rightfully restoring the honor of an independent nation, which is truly cause for celebration. This century has been a thorny and arduous path for China, filled with trials and tribulations. Now, its long-cherished wishes have been fulfilled. The revival of China is within reach. It has taken a giant step toward the liberation of Greater East Asia. The joy of the Chinese people is not hard to imagine.</p>
<p>However, recovering the concessions is merely a political measure. As for its actual effects on the ground, that is a matter for the future. For example, if public order were to deteriorate due to the recovery of the concessions, all the painstaking efforts would come to naught, and it would also damage China's reputation. In short, all future policies should be implemented under the responsibility of the Chinese themselves. Success or failure depends solely on one's own efforts. The responsibility of the Chinese people is very great, and especially for those in financial circles, who in reality occupy the central position in Shanghai, I express my expectations. Taking this opportunity, I will briefly state my humble opinions for the reference of those in Chinese financial circles.</p>
<p>Shedding Foreign Shackles</p>
<p>First, what I want to say is that Shanghai has legally shed its foreign shackles, and at the same time, it must mentally eliminate Western and American ways of thinking, and respect the talents of the Chinese and other Asians. Considering the current situation, I hope for the full implementation of the ideal of cooperating with Japan to complete the Greater East Asia War swiftly. Shanghai has always been a distribution center for goods from the interior, and at the same time, it is highly dependent on foreign trade. Therefore, it has inevitably been influenced by the West. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, foreign trade was completely cut off. In terms of not following the economy and taking an independent form of spirit, haven't the remnants of British and American influence been wiped away?</p>
<p>No Need to Worry About Material Shortages</p>
<p>For example, when Shanghai is mentioned, decadent culture comes to mind. Recently, many Chinese have said: "Japan only talks about the spirit, while America has given us a large amount of material trade." From this viewpoint, they harbor a fearful feeling towards Japan's strength in the Greater East Asia War. This is misinformed and merely a superficial view.</p>
<p>However, firstly, the Chinese will not forget that while the British and Americans imported large amounts of goods, they also imported opium. The Chinese have deeply experienced that no British or American will give away a thing without taking anything in return. Secondly, now is the height of an unprecedented war. It is only natural that even in Japan, there is not an abundance of material trade. This is not unique to Japan; it is a common phenomenon in Britain and America. Moreover, Japan has already occupied abundant resources in the South and is actively developing them. Therefore, those who harbor fear for Japan's future are completely worried unnecessarily. However, the reason for presenting this argument now is that although China possesses a vast and resource-rich land, the supply of materials is somewhat geographically imbalanced. Therefore, its spirit itself becomes the problem. Does China prefer this abundant material wealth or, at the same time, a permanent independence? If it misses today's opportunity, China will have no hope of revival! The result of the Greater East Asia War is China's future. Even for its own sake, China should seek every means today, endure hardship, and win the Greater East Asia War. Remember that the destroyers of the Six States were not Qin, but the Six States destroyed themselves.</p>
<p>Below, I would like to speak about slightly more concrete issues based on the aforementioned ideals.</p>
<p>Politics and Economy as One</p>
<p>First, politics and the economy are closely related. All independent nations must possess solid political power and strong economic power. In today's world situation, these two are ultimately not separate things. If they are not integrated, then a nation cannot become a powerful one. However, in China, an ideal relationship between the two has never existed.</p>
<p>In today's situation, every nation cannot have economic development that is not adapted to national policy. For example, the credit of currency is based on trust in the government. If the currency has no credit, then the economy cannot operate.</p>
<p>Second, what should be the guiding ideology for the economy? The economy should adapt to national policy, so its guiding ideology should naturally be to prioritize the interests of the public, eliminate selfishness, and serve the public good. Needless to say, the economic ideology of the capitalist era was to pursue profit, but today, all countries in the world are prioritizing the interests of the public, practicing the morality of putting the nation before the family, and concentrating the nation's economic power on the point of waging war. Now, to violate the demands of the nation and only indulge in the pursuit of profit is to be out of step with the countries of the world.</p>
<p>Now, the biggest problem in Shanghai that is being noticed, such as the hoarding incidents, although the situation is complex, is ultimately the result of a lack of a sense of public welfare. I hope to quickly eliminate this thinking to stabilize people's livelihoods.</p>
<p>Stabilizing People's Livelihoods, Public Welfare First</p>
<p>Third is to stabilize people's livelihoods. In all wartime economies, the public is forced to reduce their standard of living. This is truly an unavoidable phenomenon. If the minimum standard of living cannot be maintained, then the war cannot be waged. Herein lies the importance and difficulty of the people's livelihood problem.</p>
<p>China's current situation is characterized by high prices, especially the soaring prices of necessities, which makes it difficult to stabilize people's livelihoods. The biggest reason is based on the lack of a public-welfare-first concept as described above. On the other hand, the decline in production leading to a shortage of materials also plays a big role. After foreign imports have been cut off, the livelihood issues are immediately related to the issue of increasing production. Increasing production is not only related to people's livelihood, but also a crucial issue in completing the war. It does not seem easy to immediately implement increased production in Shanghai, but if China supplies abundant resources and labor, and Japan supplies capital and technology, then there may be a way to break through.</p>
<p>The Chinese People are Rich in Economic Adaptability</p>
<p>Above, I have boldly stated my humble opinions. The implementation of these matters cannot be accomplished immediately. Without the full effort of the entire Chinese people, success will ultimately be difficult to achieve. I have visited China and personally had earnest conversations with influential figures in local financial circles. I learned that you all have a firm will to complete the war, and I was deeply moved. Originally, the Chinese people are rich in economic adaptability, and their economic skills have long been recognized around the world, so once they have determined their will and put it into practice, there is no need to be uneasy about it. Our psychology is also to put all our efforts into the revival of China and the completion of the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, for China, the most powerful member of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, we earnestly hope for further cooperation in the future.</p>

<p>Mr. Oka Katsuo, the former Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, gave a radio address last night (the 4th) on the return of the Shanghai International Settlement and the French Concession to the National Government of China, broadcast from the Greater Shanghai Radio Station. His speech was as follows: Today, we in Shanghai are celebrating the return of the Shanghai International Settlement and the French Concession to the National Government of China. This event is a turning point in the history of this great nation and its people's century-long struggle for national freedom and independence. At the same time, China and its people are to be commended for their successful efforts to regain complete administrative and jurisdictional rights over the Shanghai Concessions. In my capacity as the former Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, I would like to briefly express my views on this grand event.</p>
<p>A Historical Turning Point of a Century</p>
<p>The importance and significance of this historic event are truly immense. Perhaps this significance and importance cannot be fully appreciated at this moment, but I firmly believe that it will be easily understood by all of China. What I wish to particularly express at this time is that the Japanese government and people have always wished to see China break free from the shackles of unequal treaties, as well as the exploitation and oppression of Britain and America. China's strength and independence are not only important for the welfare of the Chinese people, but also closely related to the common welfare of East Asia. This is what the nations and peoples of East Asia have been hoping for.</p>
<p>Realization of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Ideals</p>
<p>Several years ago, China and its people may have felt frustrated, and may have even abandoned the struggle for freedom and independence. Britain only gave empty promises to China and its people, and these promises, as we know, have never been fulfilled. Not only that, but those British and American countries, for the sake of developing and maintaining their selfish interests, incited China and Japan to fight each other, in order to carry out their traditional policy of division. Dr. Sun Yat-sen once said that China and Japan should be natural friends, not enemies. Today, as we celebrate this historic event, we witness the realization of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's lifelong ideals. Although the Chinese and Japanese people once had misunderstandings and engaged in war, not long after, with Japan's friendly cooperation and the understanding of both allied nations, China has regained its national independence and freedom. There is nothing that Japan and the Japanese people are more pleased about than China's ability to realize its aspirations at an early date. This fact is very clear.</p>
<p>Administrative Affairs Not Yet Successfully Completed</p>
<p>Since I took office as Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, the Council's administrative efficiency has improved, social order has been completely restored, and sound municipal financial policies have been implemented. This is something that I and my colleagues can be gratified about. All sectors of society have enthusiastically cooperated with the Council, enabling various plans to be carried out smoothly, for which I and my colleagues are deeply grateful. What is most noteworthy in Shanghai is that since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the entire society, regardless of nationality, has been united in striving for a common goal, namely, to ensure Shanghai's security and prosperity. What I regret is that there are still many administrative matters that the Council has not been able to successfully complete and that need to be continued. This is due to the fact that Shanghai's municipal administration is divided into three areas, each with its own policies on taxation, price controls, and so on. Fortunately, Shanghai's administration has now been unified, and these problems will soon be improved.</p>
<p>Joint Efforts by All Parties to Share Responsibilities</p>
<p>I would now like to express my views on the public opinion in Shanghai. The progress of the Greater East Asia War has made the citizens of this great city develop a sense of self-awareness, which has been of great help to the reform of municipal affairs. All the Chinese people, especially the citizens of Shanghai, are gradually realizing that the Chinese people should be the masters of their own destiny. As a result, a close connection has developed between the execution of municipal affairs and the opinions of leaders from all walks of life in the Chinese community. The ability of all sectors of society to understand the responsibilities of citizens is one of the healthiest signs, and the progress and development of Shanghai's future can be predicted. This point deserves to be emphasized.</p>
<p>Now that the entire municipal administration of Shanghai has been handed over to the Chinese government, I sincerely hope that the Chinese leaders will properly address the issue of China's revival. Enhancing the public spirit of the general Chinese people, and maintaining good municipal administration in Shanghai, are the two factors that guarantee Shanghai's future progress and development.</p>
<p>Hope that Citizens Trust the Authorities</p>
<p>Shanghai has a large number of civil and commercial institutions, such as clubs, trade associations, church organizations, as well as major banks and stores. I believe that the interests of these institutions and organizations should be taken into account when establishing a sound municipal management policy. The prosperity of this city is inextricably linked to sound methods of budget preparation and revenue enhancement. I also believe that since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Shanghai Municipal Council has cultivated the faith of the citizens of the city, which the Council has tried to grasp for the benefit of the public. The citizens' faith has been invaluable in helping us to perform our complex duties, and I sincerely hope that the general public and all capable people will continue to provide full assistance and support to the new municipal authorities under the leadership of Mayor Chen in the future. Mayor Chen has vast experience and a great reputation, and he is most suited to lead the administration of this great city. I am confident that Mayor Chen will gain the greatest trust and reliance from all levels of society, both Chinese and foreign. Finally, I and my colleagues would like to express our greatest confidence in the future of Shanghai. China and its people are now standing at the beginning of a new era, and we hope that they will be able to use their own creativity and intelligence to strive for progress and complete China's revival.</p>
<p>Thank you all for listening.</p>

At the same time, all criminal cases handed over by police stations throughout the city must first be transferred to the Procuratorate for investigation. Yesterday, the District Procuratorate informed all police stations in the city that all criminal cases must be handed over to the Procuratorate before 10:00 AM every morning. The case transfer form must clearly state the details of the case, along with the fingerprint card and stolen goods, which must be attached to the case for legal investigation and handling.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Director Hirota of the Press Section Discusses: The Economic Severance Between the U.S. and Argentina; Each of the Axis Powers Should Be Isolated by Force and Capitalist Domination <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>On the 3rd, the U.S. government canceled the approved exports to Argentina for 16,000 exporters throughout the U.S. that were calculated before May of this year. In effect, the U.S. and Argentina have taken steps toward economic severance. Director Hirota of the Press Section of the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai recently made a statement on this matter, pointing out that this measure clearly reveals the</p>
<p>U.S.'s Strategy and Policy</p>
<p>Mr. Hirota stated that the U.S. government, on August 3rd, issued an order to cancel export permits to Argentina for 16,000 exporters throughout the U.S. With this, the U.S. has taken the first step towards economic severance with Argentina. It is well known that Argentina has maintained a neutral policy since the outbreak of the European War and the Greater East Asia War. At the same time, Argentina has never done anything to obstruct the U.S., and the two countries have maintained friendly relations. However, the U.S. has, without reason, imposed such unfriendly and coercive policies. From this, we can deeply understand how unreasonable the U.S.'s world policy is, and it exposes its</p>
<p>Ambition to Dominate the World</p>
<p>According to reports, after Bestor stepped down and Ramirez took over as the new president, we all knew how the new president suppressed pro-British and American factions and communist countries, dissolved right-wing groups, and devoted all his efforts to maintaining a just and pure neutral policy. However, the U.S. took advantage of the Argentine military revolution to try to implement its strategy of increasing its say, which was initially valued by the general public. In reality, this kind of U.S. strategy did not progress, so it eventually resorted to forcing Argentina through economic trade. The U.S. not only attempted political interference in Argentina, but also used</p>
<p>Economic Pressure</p>
<p>to compensate for its lack of political power, exhausting all means to make Argentina comply with the U.S.'s true intentions. If we carefully and comprehensively observe this fact, we can clearly understand the U.S.'s intentions. In the past, the U.S.'s policy towards Central and South American countries was based on the Monroe Doctrine. Recently, it used Commemoration Day as the center, and Secretary Hull and Vice President Wallace, etc., used the term "idealism" to vigorously promote "free trade" and "economic cooperation between North and South America," and even said that the U.S. would bring prosperity and peace to the Americas. However, now it is using strong-arm tactics against Argentina, which is defenseless. This further shows that U.S. diplomacy is</p>
<p>Double-Faced</p>
<p>capitalist diplomacy. Japan has also experienced this kind of experience. Before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, U.S.-Japan relations gradually became dangerous from 1937 to 1938. Therefore, the U.S. began to expand its military in 1938, and in December 1939, it implemented the so-called morally prohibitive exports to Japan. On the other hand, the U.S. government issued an export ban, but this measure could not be applied because it conflicted with the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce. Therefore, the U.S. government instructed exporters to take a morally prohibitive export ban. In reality, the U.S. was no longer able to export aircraft, trucks, ships, and machine tools. By July 26 of the following year (1940), the U.S. announced the abolition of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Navigation and Commerce, which took effect six months later on January 26, 1941. From that time on, the U.S. ban on exports to Japan became legally effective. Following this, on July 26 of the same year, a capital freeze order was issued, and exports of oil to Japan were also included in the ban. The U.S.'s attitude towards Japan</p>
<p>verbally</p>
<p>used beautiful words of justice, humanity, and friendship as its diplomatic policy. However, on the other hand, it expanded its military and adopted economic policies to contain Japan, the core of military expansion, which eventually led to the unavoidable outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. Chile also severed diplomatic relations with the Axis powers on January 20 of this year. However, the U.S.'s policy towards Chile is the same as its policy towards Argentina this time. The U.S.'s actions towards Argentina, which is the most impartial and sincerely maintains neutrality, are enough to show that the U.S.'s purpose in waging war is to use coercive means to prevent other countries from being independent and self-reliant. At the same time, it is also clear that although the U.S. verbally claims to implement idealistic policies and guarantee the independence of other countries, in fact, the U.S.</p>
<p>has no scruples</p>
<p>and intends to dominate the world with its military and capital power. I therefore advocate that it should be isolated from the world war instigator, Roosevelt. This should be implemented not only by the Axis powers and neutral countries, but also by all the Allied countries other than the U.S.</p>

<p>Since the establishment of the Eighth District Public Office, the heads of all departments in the district office have fully taken over their duties. Mayor Chen, concurrently District Head of the Eighth District, inspected the fire department staff of the district on the morning of the 4th. After arriving at the district office at 10:00 AM, he went to the Songshan Road Fire Department of the Fire Department at 10:30 AM, accompanied by Chief Secretary Zhao Zunyue. Director Xia Guoliang and Deputy Director Bao Ru of the department greeted them at the entrance. After District Head Chen inspected all the fire department staff, he delivered an address, and then rested in the director's office. During this time, Director Chen inquired about the details of the fire department's affairs in the district from Director Xia and Deputy Director Bao Ru. After 11:00 AM, he accompanied Chief Secretary Zhao, Director Xia, and others to inspect the Xin Kaihe and Bai Li Tong Road fire departments.</p>
<p>Director's Address</p>
<p>He briefly commented that today, seeing you all energetic and full of spirit, I am very pleased. Your service as firefighters in the city is crucial, and your work is as important as the police force. Everyone's efforts in this district in the past are well-known. Now that Shanghai's municipal administration is unified, the fire department's work should also be unified. Therefore, I hope that you will continue to work hard with the spirit of the past, so that Shanghai's fire department will be further strengthened. I would especially like to thank you all for your hard work in the past, and I hope that you will work even harder in the future, so as to strengthen Shanghai's fire department.</p>

<p>According to the Datong News Agency, the Rice and Flour Allocation Office of the Materials Control Department will distribute warehouse receipts to rice shops starting today (the 5th) for the 43rd installment of household rice. Sales are expected to begin in about a day. According to a reporter from the Datong News Agency who inquired at the Rice and Flour Allocation Office, the amount of rice for this installment is still one and a half liters due to the limited amount of rice allocated by the Joint Cooperative, priced at 9 yuan. The quality of the rice is the same as the previous installment.</p>

<p>The Municipal Education Bureau believes that many junior high school entrance exams in the city include English as a subject. This is not only inconsistent with the regulations, but also prevents students who have not learned English in elementary school from taking the exams, which is quite inappropriate. Therefore, it has issued a notice to all schools, stipulating that junior high school entrance exams should not include foreign languages as a principle. If necessary, students may choose one subject of Japanese or English.</p>
<h3 id="e29">Director of Finance Bureau's Broadcast Address <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>The celebration of the recovery of the concessions, organized by the Municipal Propaganda Office, was broadcast yesterday by Director Yuan of the Finance Bureau. The broadcast address briefly stated: The Shanghai International Settlement and French Concession were recovered two days ago on the 5th and 6th. The joy of the people has reached its peak. You can imagine this from the joy and excitement of a group of people. Why are the people so excited about the recovery of the concessions? In reality, the sins of the concessions were too many, and the oppression by the British and Americans was too severe. Oppression leads to resistance, and the more severe it is, the more likely it is to lead to resistance. Now that the concessions have been recovered, Japan has taken over the concessions for a very short period of time and has established a self-defense corps, allowing the people to directly defend themselves and fulfill their duties. I believe that in the future, the police can be well-trained. Although we do not advocate leaving doors unlocked at night or not picking up lost items, we can at least allow the residents to sleep peacefully. As long as the people live and work in peace and contentment, the city will naturally be peaceful and prosperous, making this the largest city in East Asia and turning it into an ideal paradise. That way, we will not fail the good intentions of those who have returned and helped us.</p>
<h3 id="e30">First District Education Director Lin Jiong'an Discusses Education Facilities; No Major Changes in the Education Department's Personnel; Future Policy Focuses on Improving Thought <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>After the official establishment of the First District Public Office, the educational administrative facilities in the entire district have been of great concern to all parties. A reporter from the Guofeng News Agency visited Director Lin of the Education Department at the First District Public Office yesterday, and Mr. Lin made the following statement.</p>
<p>No Major Changes in Department Personnel</p>
<p>Since the reorganization of this department, there have been no major changes in personnel. I am the director, and Mr. Ueno Taichu, the former director of the Education Department of the Public Works Department, is now the deputy director. In addition, Mr. Tian Jun has been appointed as the deputy director. Mr. Tan has served as a professor at St. John's University and has a lot of experience in educational administration. I come to the department to work every morning and return to the Municipal Bureau in the afternoon to handle affairs. Although the time is a bit rushed, everything here has a basis because of the grand plans of the former director, Mr. Ueno.</p>
<p>Improving Thought in Future Education</p>
<p>Regarding the focus of future education, we will start with improving thought. This has already been seen in my broadcast speech yesterday. We will do our best to eliminate enslaved education and will not take British and American comprador education with an excessively individualistic color as the central curriculum standard. We will follow the central government's instructions and take Chinese language as the foundation. The detailed reform plan is currently being drafted. In the past, the Public Works Department had two departments: Western education and Chinese education. All former public primary and secondary schools have now been renamed Shanghai Special City Public Primary and Secondary Schools. There are currently four male middle schools, one female middle school, seven primary schools, one night school, and five ordinary night schools. The school opening date was originally scheduled for September 1st. In order to be consistent with other districts in the city, the middle school will be changed to August 24th, and the primary school will be scheduled to open on August 22nd.</p>
<p>Improving Efficiency and Treatment</p>
<p>Regarding the state of anarchy in private schools in the past, we will strictly rectify them from now on. We will thoroughly manage the income and expenditure of the schools. This department has clear regulations on the fee standards according to the methods stipulated by the Municipal Bureau. The minimum and maximum fees must not be exceeded. In order to improve educational efficiency, it is necessary to hire excellent teachers. In order to stabilize their lives and make them feel excited about their work, we have issued a notice to all private schools that 70% of the fees collected will be used for teachers' salaries and 30% will be used for the school's regular expenses. This department will also send personnel to the schools to investigate.</p>

<p>The First and Third Police Bureaus of Shanghai Special City have decided to strengthen the original security corps organization within their jurisdictions and establish security corps offices directly under the jurisdiction of the respective police bureaus. The position of director has already been internally determined. Deputy Director Su Chengde will concurrently serve as deputy director. In the first district, Mr. Shigeta Mitsuji, the former director of the Security Corps Guidance Committee, will concurrently serve. The eighth district has not yet been determined. The internal organization is still under review. As for the lower-level organization, it will temporarily maintain its original state and is not intended to be changed.</p>

<p>The former Masnan Road Prison in the French Concession has been converted into the Shanghai Local Procuratorate Detention Center. The newly appointed director of the detention center, Mr. Wang Baosan, has taken over his duties. It has been found that the detainees in the detention center are those awaiting trial who have been detained by various police bureaus and transferred to the procuratorate for investigation. Those who have been convicted are transferred to Tilanqiao Shanghai Prison for execution. Since the prison was converted into a detention center, it still detains more than 100 convicts of the former Special No. 2 Court and more than 200 detainees of the Security Command, who have not yet been transferred to Shanghai Prison. Therefore, the detention center is rushing to handle the matter. At present, the suspects who have been transferred to the procuratorate for investigation by the police bureaus are temporarily returned to the police bureaus for detention after the investigation. Once the detention center has completed the transfer of the convicts, it will officially detain the suspects detained by the police bureaus.</p>

<p>Yuan Qimei, a native of Jiading, who was a teacher at Minli Nanyang Women's Middle School and Sanyu Middle School, and whose essay was selected as the first prize winner in the monthly essay contest in this newspaper, was killed by bandits this spring when he accompanied his wife back to his hometown of Tangzhen. After his family reported the incident to the local military and police authorities, requesting the arrest of the murderer, Zhang Weiguang, the captain of the Jiading Rural Clearing Enforcement Team, arrested Yuan Nengwen (nicknamed A Xiang), the main culprit in the case. After interrogation, it was learned that the murderer was also the victim's nephew. Captain Zhang believed that the murderer dared to commit such a murder in the Qingxiang area, and that the murdered person was his uncle, which was extremely illegal. Therefore, he was immediately sent to the Shanghai Security Command Vehicle Law Office for strict punishment according to law. Economic Affairs</p>
<h3 id="e37">Commenting on Oath; Matchsticks Distributed by Household <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>According to the Daily News, matchstick distribution is currently being actively planned and may be implemented around the end of this month. It is also heard that a household allocation method will be adopted to eliminate merchants from profiting from it. If matchsticks are really distributed by household, it would be a somewhat satisfactory thing, because matchsticks are the most indispensable of daily necessities, and they are also relatively inexpensive among daily necessities. However, the price of matchsticks has also skyrocketed along with other items, threatening the lives of ordinary people no less than firewood, rice, oil, and salt, and should not be ignored due to their small size and light price.</p>
<p>Due to the household distribution of matchsticks, I think of the necessity of reforming all allocation systems in wartime economic control. Take cigarettes, for example. If strict allocation methods are really adopted, even using the Baojia system to implement cigarette allocation by head (of course, it must be certified by the Jia head as a genuine smoker), then the limited-price cigarettes will not become the current open cigarette black market.</p>
<p>In short, in a word, the widespread implementation of the consumption allocation system can block the path for the industrial and commercial sectors to make illegal profits.</p>
<h3 id="e38">Authorities Pay Close Attention to Real Estate Speculation in This City <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>The real estate in this city has been rising continuously in price since last year, and speculative merchants are even using real estate as a "kick the ball" type of transaction. As a result, real estate prices have also risen several times a day in the past six months. This kind of "kick the ball" transaction method involves large companies with strong financial resources purchasing a large alley at once, and then distributing the houses in the alley for sale. Another type involves smaller real estate speculators gathering three or five people to jointly purchase several houses, and then selling the houses at a good price within three to five days, making countless profits with one turnover. However, once this trend starts, the residents of the alleys in this city often suffer from the unreasonable bullying of the landlords, forced to move and increase rent. Under the pressure of heavy pressure, the narrow living spaces are even more restless. Recently, in the past month or two, the authorities in this city have been thoroughly investigating hoarding, sparing no effort, and those who hoard commodities have been severely punished. As a result, the general hoarders have shifted their sights and turned to hoarding real estate, and this hoarding behavior is becoming larger and larger. It is heard that the relevant authorities are now paying close attention to it.</p>

<p>The municipal authorities believe that the most important issue in this city at present is to suppress prices. Therefore, they are currently uniting with all relevant parties to conduct urgent discussions in order to implement effective measures.

<h3 id="e43">Hua Stock Trend <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Hua stocks were small, which was a legacy of the fatigue of the past two days. Selling followed one after another, but suddenly became firm at the foot after noon. The selling prices of various stocks at noon had already been absorbed by those who had entered. The good reason was that the price drop of gold had stopped, and new and old investments had restarted. Among the various stocks, there were still those that were smaller than the previous day. Yongan Company broke through the seventh level and then went out. Xinxin and Guohuo successively broke into the fourth level. China Underwear was flat and fatigued, Jingfu Shirts and Socks firmly stood at the fifth level, Jinglun slightly recovered, Yongan Textile was reduced by another fifty. The shares of Xinxiang, Rongfeng, Xinfeng, Guoguang, Guoxin, Zhenfeng, Gonghe, Wuhe, and other small denominations all had considerable drops. Hongshen and Da Zhonghua Weaving also saw a reduction, and they all broke into the level. Zhonghua Dyeing and Weaving alone was firm and cultural industry was the most stagnant. Commerce, Zhonghua, and World Bookstores, and Yongxiang Printing House all firmly stood at the original price. The price of the new pharmaceutical industry, Xinyi, Zhongxi, and Wuzhou, was around the same. Da Zhonghua Match Factory retreated to the fourth level. The public utility industry fell sharply. Zhabei Water and Electricity and Beishang Electric each fell by dozens. The latter retreated near the third level. Shanghai Tricycle alone was firm and expensive. Among the industrial stocks, only China Investment still saw an increase. Xinghua Industrial has already risen, and demand exceeds supply. The rest, such as Jiu'an and Da Zhonghua Industrial, Xinya Construction, and Guohua Investment, all had small trades. Xin Yi and Lianhua Real Estate also saw a slight decrease.

<p>New soybeans will soon be successively available. It is reported that the new "cowhide" soybeans from Changzhou have already arrived on the market. Grain merchants are already heading there to purchase them in succession, and a large amount is expected to arrive in Shanghai within days.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the local tofu industry has been suffering for some time due to the suspension of soybean rationing. Relying on the black market has proven to be both expensive and difficult to procure. They have recently petitioned the Grain Bureau, requesting that they devise a plan to supply soybeans in order to maintain their businesses.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Summary of Market Conditions <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Gold and Silver: Yesterday morning, the gold shops' trade association dealt in jewelry gold, but there were still no retail sales. The after-hours price had become stable. The opening price once rose, then immediately fell back outside the major checkpoints. The after-hours price for silver stood at 100.</p>
<p>Government Bonds: The over-the-counter market for unified government bonds showed mixed movements. Series C rebounded, Series B slightly declined, Series A slightly rose, Series D fell, and Series E remained unchanged. Transactions were only recorded for Series A.</p>
<p>Yarn and Cloth: Due to difficulties in transport, actual sales were nonexistent, resulting in scarce transactions. Only 20-count Hangzhou yarn and Shuangma cloth had asking prices, slightly lower than yesterday. The trend in the cotton cloth market weakened. After the initial opening in the morning, prices fell across the board due to widespread selling, leading to a generally lower close compared to the previous day. Longtou fine cloth, Four Gentlemen quasi-gingham, Peach Blossom Nvshi cloth, San Yang serge all experienced slight declines, and transactions were scarce.</p>
<p>Rayon: The market was quite weak, mainly because yarn and cloth transactions were sluggish. As a result, both insiders and outsiders adopted a wait-and-see attitude, and prices had fallen into the 60,000 range.</p>
<p>Bean Cake: Recently, due to infrequent inland transportation and a small amount of cottonseed cake being shipped eastward, confidence was particularly lacking, and the price remained firm.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Activities of Various Trade Associations <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Tea Industry Federation: The joint conference of tea industry trade associations from various regions (Zhenjiang, Suzhou, Kangjiang, Shaoxing, Dinghai, etc., included) held its inaugural meeting yesterday (the 4th) at 3 PM at the clubhouse on Tiantang Street. More than a dozen representatives from ten regions in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui and from Beijing and Shanghai attended. Representatives from the relevant authorities were dispatched to provide guidance. After discussing the association's articles of association and electing directors and supervisors, an inauguration ceremony was held. The elected directors included Zhang Jialing, Wang Zhenshi, Zhan Shiyuan, Hong Jingwu, Huang Yantang, and seventeen others. The supervisors included Tang Jisan, Sheng Yixing, Chen Shisheng, Fang Jihong, Wu Hongsheng, and seven others.</p>
<p>Songtai District Grain Industry: The Songtai District Grain Industry Trade Association believes that Huangdu Town in Qingpu County is far from the county office, and transportation is obstructed, but grain production is abundant, making it necessary to establish an office to facilitate the handling of association affairs. Wu Shixing has been appointed as the director of the office and is starting to organize it. It will be established soon.</p>

<h3 id="e48">The True Meaning of Freedom <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Bi</p>
<p>Some people say that the meaning of "freedom" is not having anyone controlling you—that a free person can do anything he pleases. He is not like a horse or an ox being whipped forward or backward by someone else. If "freedom" is defined merely as being able to do what you please, then there would never be such a thing as "freedom" in this world.</p>
<p>In a chaotic country without laws, police, or government, you can come and go as you please, work or wander as you please, and even steal or kill as you please. However, this is not your true freedom, because under this so-called "freedom," you are also in danger of being robbed, hindered, or even killed. In a savage region where there are no rules, laws, or anything else; on a deserted island where no one opposes or stops you, your true "freedom" can be said to be completely lost, because everything you do is worthless, the content of your "freedom" is useless, and the meaning of your "freedom" is too small.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in a country with a strong government and strict laws, a person has the most opportunities for development, which means he is the freest person, because he can use the opportunities given by the country to contribute to great undertakings. This is true freedom that benefits the masses.</p>
<h3 id="e49">The Relationship Between Profit and Disorder <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>— Gan Zhong'an</p>
<p>The Analects say: "Zi Gong speaks of profit." Mencius also says: "Those who rise at cockcrow to pursue profit are followers of [the villain Zhi]." From this, we can see that the great sages and virtuous men of ancient times did not approve of "profit" because profit is the origin of disorder.</p>
<p>In modern times, customs are base, and those who seek profit are everywhere. Speaking of profit, there are two types: legitimate and illegitimate. For example, a farmer works hard to cultivate the land and contributes his harvest to society after the autumn harvest. Earning a profit to maintain a livelihood is a legitimate profit. As for the hoarders in Shanghai today, who take advantage of others' misfortunes, hoarding goods on a large scale and then selling them at illegally high prices, exploiting the common people, their so-called profit is extremely illegitimate. People toil for profit, endure all kinds of hardships for profit, and even lose their lives for profit. From this, we can see that its allure is truly unparalleled. In the past, warlords fought each other for territory, which led to war. As a result, the people suffered, becoming displaced and lacking food and clothing. What is the reason for this?</p>
<p>If we want to stop the disorder, we must first eliminate the concept of profit from people's minds. How can we do this? In this degenerate age, "if the Taoist is one foot high, the devil is ten feet high." This is due to the defects of the system, which need to be reformed. On the other hand, we must pay attention to the function of education. If everyone receives a good education, then knowledge will be enhanced, and people will know what they should and should not do. They will also understand the difference between good and evil. If everyone has no concept of "profit," disorder will naturally not occur.</p>

<p>Whatever you do, if you don't do it, don't do it. Once you do it, you should not only do it well but also do it the best.</p>

<p>Never rashly criticize others. Observe everything with a calm attitude.</p>
<p>Resisting tyrannical forces without surrendering is the best character.</p>

<h3 id="e52">A Humble Word to the "China Railway" Authorities <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Guoyuan</p>
<p>Railway transportation is like the aorta of the human body. It not only bears the mission of transporting nutrients to the various tissues of the body but also has a close relationship with all the systems of the body. When this circulatory system is obstructed or its effectiveness is hampered by the aorta's unhealthiness, it will not only affect the health of the human body but also seriously affect a person's life. In the past, because inland waterway transport could not fully operate and develop, the importance of railway transport became even greater. On the vital lines of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways, how many millions of people come and go through the large throughput port of Shanghai North Station every day? Therefore, the responsibilities of the "China Railway" authorities are not only for transport but also have a great impact on the economy, people's livelihood, public safety, and order.</p>
<p>Regarding the urgent need to improve railway transportation, the Shen Bao's editorial has boldly and faithfully said many things that everyone felt in their hearts but was reluctant to say. Today, I take the opportunity of the "China Railway" authorities thoroughly reorganizing the internal mechanism to offer some superficial suggestions that I feel with the utmost sincerity to the "China Railway" authorities.</p>
<p>Originally, the reorganization of "China Railway" was to adapt to the rapidly increasing business and to achieve thorough streamlining and upward efficiency. Therefore, the new system that emerges after the reform will surely live up to the expectations of the people and achieve the desired results. However, I believe that in the process of reform, we should not pay too much attention to the big picture and neglect the small details. It is best to be able to "focus on the big picture and start with the small details!" For example, to make the business prosper, the defense along the way is strict, the security and order within the station are enhanced...etc., are all big goals. If you want to achieve this big goal, you must start with the training of grassroots cadres. If you pay too much attention to the big and neglect the small, it is like a big tree without half of its roots wanting to have lush branches. Some small details that need to be improved may not have been thoroughly observed by the authorities, so I offer a little bit for the company authorities to improve: that is, the work skills and service ethics of the employees: I am not criticizing, nor am I blaming. Indeed, a group of employees have neglected their responsibilities and ethics too much. For example, skimming off the top when selling tickets, being rude and fooling strangers, and openly defrauding vendors often cause serious consequences, causing resentment and aversion among citizens! I hope that the directorate can at least do the following: Increase the number of trips and vehicles to reduce the phenomenon of crowding, so as not to allow unscrupulous elements to profit from it. Pay attention to training employees' thinking and morality; strictly implement the method of rewarding merits and punishing sins so that they all have the virtue of serving and loving people. Ban financial vendors to help increase the effectiveness of the system and at the same time ensure the order and tranquility of real passengers. Adopt the suggestions of the public opinion circles as much as possible, and adhere to the attitude of accepting advice, "correct it if there is something, and encourage it if there is nothing." Finally, in order to ensure public safety, it is really necessary to drive away the ruffians, hooligans, and Bai Xiang people who are in the station! This will prevent passengers from having the psychology of treating going out as a long journey.</p>
